<i>NARRATOR: In part one,
Fonzie was repairing a <i>hearse</i></i>

01:24.484 --> 01:25.610
<i>and discovered
counterfeit money hidden</i>

01:25.752 --> 01:27.311

01:28.589 --> 01:30.648
<i>Fonzie decides
to return the hearse</i>

01:30.791 --> 01:32.759

“The Candy Man“.</i>

01:48.008 --> 01:50.841
<i>Now the Candy Man
is after Fonzie</i>

Fonzie, Fonzie, you're alive!

02:35.255 --> 02:36.279
- You're alive!
- I'm alive.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.414
Oh! You're alive!

02:38.558 --> 02:39.957
- All right, hold it, hold it.
- Right.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.390
Of course, I'm alive.

02:41.528 --> 02:43.360
Just a little
gasoline explosion.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.965
Gasoline explosion nothing.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.566
Those counterfeiters are trying
to kill you, Fonzie.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.792
That was no gasoline explosion.

02:47.934 --> 02:48.924
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.298
- I'm telling you.
- Slow, slow.

02:50.437 --> 02:51.529
All right.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.867
I want to hear every word.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.030
All right.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.403
- I overheard them, Fonz.
- Yeah?

02:55.542 --> 02:57.601
And you know the Candy Man,
the...

02:57.744 --> 02:59.007
- Yeah.
- And the other, the...

02:59.146 --> 03:00.409
-and-and the tall...
- Yeah.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.743
They know that-that you took
the money out of the coffin

03:02.883 --> 03:04.442
and they're trying
to silence you, Fonz.

03:04.584 --> 03:06.052
I mean, they're trying
to silence you for good.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.483
All right, all right.
They hushed me.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.679
They didn't silence me.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.586
How in the world did you
even survive this?

03:10.724 --> 03:12.283
Well, because at the time
of the explosion,

03:12.426 --> 03:14.588
I was behind
my address book, whoa.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.492
Yeah, whoa and...
(imitates explosion)

03:16.630 --> 03:18.462
Yes. Hey, Richie.

03:18.598 --> 03:19.929
- Yeah.
- Let me tell you something.

03:20.067 --> 03:23.162
Those guys are beginning to make
me a little angry, you know?

03:31.812 --> 03:33.803
(cackling)

03:38.852 --> 03:39.910
Cherry lollipop!

03:40.053 --> 03:42.078
Cherry lollipop.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.212
Report.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.290
We blew him up, Candy Man.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.688
(imitates explosion)

03:46.827 --> 03:48.090
Fonzarelli the mechanic

03:48.228 --> 03:50.322
is now at the corner
of Fourth and Main.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.795
And Fifth and Main,

03:51.932 --> 03:53.263
and Sixth and Main.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.595
Now listen carefully.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.760
I want you to go
to the secret room,

03:56.903 --> 04:00.840
get those two clowns we tied up
and have them call home.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.241
We're going to let
you boys call home

04:10.383 --> 04:11.748
so your folks don't worry.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.910
The Candy Man doesn't
want anybody to miss you

04:14.054 --> 04:16.079
and come nosing around here.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.817
You do want to go home,
don't you?

04:18.959 --> 04:21.257
Oh, sure,
my father'll probably talk to me

04:21.394 --> 04:22.486
since I'm all tied up.

04:22.629 --> 04:23.619
I'll call home.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.391
My mother worries
if I stay out late.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.125
What's your name, kid?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.996
Cunningham.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.661
Ralph Cunningham.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.239
BOTH:
Dial.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.871
I should've brought
my rubber nose.

04:45.485 --> 04:46.975
(phone ringing)

04:47.120 --> 04:48.417
MARION:
I'll get it.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.390
Hello.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.516
Oh, hello, Ralph.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.129
Howard, he called me Mom.

04:56.263 --> 04:58.254
Who called you Mom?

04:59.833 --> 05:02.666
Well, Ralph Malph, dear.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.794
What is it, Ralph?

05:04.938 --> 05:07.236
- He did it again, Howard.
- Okay, let me...

05:07.374 --> 05:09.001
Ralph, what's going on?

05:09.142 --> 05:11.201
He just called me Dad.

05:12.612 --> 05:15.638
Look, Ralph, will you
stop clowning and...

05:15.782 --> 05:16.908
What's that?

05:17.050 --> 05:19.212
You won't be home tonight?

05:19.352 --> 05:21.912
And Potsie won't
be home tonight.

05:22.055 --> 05:25.355
And your nose hurts.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.722
All right, good night, son.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.296
What am I saying?

05:31.464 --> 05:33.694
MARION:
Oh, Arthur, look at you!

05:33.834 --> 05:36.064
Richard, what happened?

05:36.203 --> 05:37.728
There was a blast tonight.

05:37.871 --> 05:41.102
You two, you always have such
a good time together.

05:41.241 --> 05:44.438
Mr. C., Mrs. C.,
let me tell you something.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.068
Your son's talking the truth.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.908
We're talking boomsville,
you know?

05:48.048 --> 05:50.676
Glass shattering, smoke.

05:50.817 --> 05:53.184
The counterfeiters tried
to blow up Fonzie's garage

05:53.320 --> 05:54.378
with Fonzie in it.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.011
Well, now how do you know
it was them?

05:56.156 --> 05:57.282
Tell them, Rich.

05:57.424 --> 05:58.448
Because I overheard them

05:58.592 --> 06:00.185
when I was laying
in the casket, Dad.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.390
Blown up, casket...

06:03.530 --> 06:05.430
Oh, this is such
a confusing night.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.329
Now will you just start
from the beginning?

06:07.467 --> 06:09.196
No, Mom, no, I got to call
the police now.

06:09.336 --> 06:10.997
- Yeah. -I'm gonna reheat
the hot chocolate.

06:11.137 --> 06:13.299
That's what I do the best
when things are confusing.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.240
From the looks of Fonzie,

06:16.376 --> 06:18.037
he needs something
a lot stronger.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.202
You're not kidding.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.711
Those small marshmallows.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.713
Oh, they're in the,
in the cupboard there, Arthur.

06:22.849 --> 06:24.476
- Yeah.
-(doorbell rings)

06:24.618 --> 06:26.450
Oh, Jiminy Crickets, what now?

06:26.586 --> 06:28.714
Hello, Operator,
I need the police.

06:28.855 --> 06:29.947
Uh, Peterson, Treasury.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.149
Yes, I know, I know.
Come on in, Mr. Peterson.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.987
Oh, this is my son Richard.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.891
Richard, this is Mr. Peterson
of the Treasury Department.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.155
Uh, Peterson, Treasury.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.458
Oh, hi.

06:38.598 --> 06:40.464
Well, thanks anyway,
but I got a T-man.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.568
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you.

06:42.702 --> 06:45.433
Uh, uh, please,
I have a sad duty to perform.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.973
Arthur Fonzarelli was blown up.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.234
If it's any consolation,

06:49.376 --> 06:51.242
I assure you
he-he didn't suffer.

06:51.378 --> 06:52.846
He merely died.

06:52.979 --> 06:54.640
Hey, want some hot chocolate?

06:54.781 --> 06:56.647
- Uh, no thanks, I'm on duty.
- Oh, all right.

06:56.783 --> 06:58.547
It's a good thing 'cause
it's got marshmallows in it.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.483
You!
"Me!

07:00.620 --> 07:01.610
You're alive!

07:01.755 --> 07:02.916
What was your first clue?

07:03.056 --> 07:04.285
But how?

07:04.424 --> 07:05.789
H ow?

07:05.926 --> 07:07.621
He was standing
behind his address book

07:07.761 --> 07:08.990
at the time of the explosion.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.619
One little address book?

07:10.764 --> 07:14.826
Nah, six four-drawer
steel filing cabinets.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.300
Fonzie knows a lot of girls.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.906
Oh, I figured it out.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.565
Yes, I know, Peterson.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.234
Nice picture.

07:24.377 --> 07:25.970
You figured what out,
sweetheart?

07:26.112 --> 07:27.944
Ralph and Potsie's phone call.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.139
What about Ralph and Potsie?

07:29.282 --> 07:30.443
Oh, Ralph called up here

07:30.583 --> 07:32.381
pretending
he was Ralph Cunningham.

07:32.519 --> 07:33.953
- It's not important.
- Yes, it is.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.556
They went with me to the
Heavenly Slumber Funeral Parlor.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.454
Now, now, Fonz, you don't
suppose that they, uh...

07:38.591 --> 07:40.582
They got their hands
on Ralph and Potsie, right?

07:40.727 --> 07:42.058
- Right.
- We're going down there.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.289
We're gonna add three more
stiffs to their inventory.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.990
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- No.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.327
- No?
- No.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.957
Thanks a lot, T-man.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.570
All right, look,

07:50.704 --> 07:51.899
Candy Man thinks I'm dead,
right?

07:52.038 --> 07:53.267
- Right.
- All right.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.067
What's the best way to get
into a funeral parlor?

07:55.208 --> 07:57.677
Having a funeral,
even if it is mine.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.779
- We catch Candy Man
with the goods. -Right.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.109
We save Ralph and Potsie and,
you know,

08:02.248 --> 08:03.579
they were saying that they want

08:03.717 --> 08:04.878
their next shipment
to go to Detroit.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.417
That's great, Rich.

08:06.553 --> 08:08.681
Look, we just tell them
that our loved one,

08:08.822 --> 08:10.551
which happens to be me,
(chuckles)

08:10.690 --> 08:13.523
wants to be buried in Detroit.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.684
Great plan.

08:14.828 --> 08:15.954
Now, wait a minute.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.359
I'll admit
that it's a good plan,

08:17.497 --> 08:18.965
but, you know,
it could be very dangerous.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.157
It's for your country.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.961
Dad, look, Ralph and Potsie

08:22.102 --> 08:24.161
are in trouble and look
what they did to Fonzie.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.534
Yeah, they mussed my hair.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.471
Besides, you guys are gonna
have the funeral parlor

08:28.608 --> 08:29.871
under surveillance
at all times, right?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.068
PETERSON:
That's right.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.509
Well, why not?

08:33.645 --> 08:35.239
We're such good citizens.

08:35.381 --> 08:36.474
One last thing.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.176
No one must know
that Fonzarelli's alive.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.878
No one outside
this house can know.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.921
That funeral has to look
as real as possible.

08:43.056 --> 08:46.583
If the Candy Man finds out,
we're all in a lot of danger.

08:46.726 --> 08:49.320
BOTH:
Candy Man.

08:52.332 --> 08:56.394
Candy Man, we should finish
printing the money by 1:00.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.435
Perfect.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.561
The train to Detroit
leaves at 4:00.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.333
Boss, how're we gonna send
the shipment?

09:01.474 --> 09:03.135
We ain't got a body
in the coffin.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.539
MARION:
Yoo-hoo!

09:04.677 --> 09:06.042
Anybody home?

09:10.717 --> 09:12.481
Hi.

09:12.619 --> 09:14.883
We'd like to bury a friend.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.917
My assistant will be glad
to show you

09:19.059 --> 09:20.493
to another funeral parlor.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.652
We're all booked up.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.321
Oh, it would be
a very short ceremony.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.762
The actual burial would be
in Detroit.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.425
- Detroit! -Detroit.
- Detroit!

09:28.568 --> 09:31.060
- Detroit.
-(cackles)

09:31.204 --> 09:33.764
Perhaps we could fit you in.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.604
EUGENE:
Uh, where is the loved one?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.768
Well, he's in here.

09:38.912 --> 09:39.936
ALL:
In there?!

09:40.080 --> 09:41.605
There was an explosion.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.410
This is all that's left
of Arthur Fonzarelli.

09:44.551 --> 09:45.484
Fonza...

09:45.618 --> 09:47.086
ALL:
...relli.

09:49.155 --> 09:50.816
We'd like to have
the funeral fast.

09:50.957 --> 09:52.891
- Right away.
- Right away?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.551
Well, there should be
a period of mourning.

09:54.694 --> 09:55.718
You're right, dear.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.057
How about after lunch?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.665
Perfect. (chuckles)

09:58.798 --> 10:01.597
My assistant will give you
all the arrangements.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.600
Come, Eugene.

10:03.736 --> 10:06.603
Are you the next of kin?

10:06.739 --> 10:09.140
No, we're making arrangements
for his mother.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.902
- Oh.
- I'll get her.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.273
Ah, his mother.

10:12.412 --> 10:15.848
Yes, the Widow Fonzarelli.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.973
MARION:
Come in, dear.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.470
Is this the guy that tried
to blow me up?

10:37.604 --> 10:39.732
Uh-huh.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.109
(in high-pitched voice):
Are you the man that is going

10:46.246 --> 10:50.149
to make the arrangements
for my son?

10:50.283 --> 10:52.650
Yes, it is, Widow Fonzarelli.

10:52.785 --> 10:54.275
That's nice.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.478
(shouts)

10:57.657 --> 10:58.886
Widow?

10:59.025 --> 11:01.119
Widow, cool it.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.991
<i>L</i> was SO overcome.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.663
If you'll walk this way, please.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.794
(muttering)

11:14.841 --> 11:17.276
As you can see,
we have a variety

11:17.410 --> 11:20.505
of caskets here
at Heavenly Slumber.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.877
I was a-thinking about something

11:23.016 --> 11:26.179
in the memory of Arturo
in leather.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.684
Leather?

11:27.820 --> 11:29.151
With a zipper.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.960
(muffled): If somebody
doesn't find us soon,

11:35.094 --> 11:37.085
we're gonna die!

11:45.972 --> 11:47.963
(women whispering)

11:55.515 --> 11:57.745
- Fonzie!
- Oh, please let us...

12:04.357 --> 12:05.586
It's incredible!

12:05.725 --> 12:07.989
Girls lined up as far
as the eye can see.

12:08.127 --> 12:09.959
This is the first funeral

12:10.096 --> 12:14.124
they ever had to have a,
uh, parade permit.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.325
Shh!

12:15.468 --> 12:17.061
(organ Ff laying)

12:17.203 --> 12:18.170
Let's do something.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.295
- Hm?
- Pay our respects.

12:24.210 --> 12:26.975
Oh, Howard, look,
they're so shiny and lifelike.

12:31.150 --> 12:32.481
Just think,

12:32.619 --> 12:34.917
I'll never hear
the word "Shortcake" again.

12:35.054 --> 12:38.024
Joanie,
it's just a pretend funeral.

12:38.157 --> 12:41.388
I know, but I don't want to let
a good funeral go to waste.

12:41.527 --> 12:44.019
Oh, Arthur, I'm gonna miss you.

12:44.163 --> 12:45.892
(crying): Remember the time
you missed dinner?

12:46.032 --> 12:47.090
I forgive you.

12:47.233 --> 12:48.496
- I didn't mean to be so upset.
- Marion...

12:48.635 --> 12:50.160
- And I loved doing your laundry.
- Marion!

12:50.303 --> 12:51.361
- I loved it!
- Sit down.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.495
(sobbing)

12:57.910 --> 12:59.605
You were terrific, Mrs. C.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.180
Thank you, Arthur.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.874
I feel much better.

13:06.052 --> 13:08.043
All right, keep looking.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.319
Psst!

13:11.457 --> 13:12.822
We've got to stall.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.427
So far we've searched
the premises,

13:14.560 --> 13:16.050
and we still can't locate
the printing press.

13:16.195 --> 13:18.493
When we do,
I'll give you the signal.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.689
Okay.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.493
Oh.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.692
What about Ralph and Potsie?

13:22.835 --> 13:23.996
You think they're gonna be okay?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.730
As long as they don't try
anything foolish.

13:25.872 --> 13:27.271
Oh.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.876
They're taking long enough.

13:30.009 --> 13:32.478
We don't want to miss
that 4:00 train.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.603
Hurry them up!

13:36.916 --> 13:38.315
We have to move it along.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.385
We have a lot of bodies waiting.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.251
EUGENE:
Let the mourners in.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.058
- Help!
'Help. he")!

13:47.193 --> 13:49.127
Help! Get me out of here.

13:57.704 --> 14:00.503
His boots look so peaceful.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.109
And the music's so fitting.

14:03.242 --> 14:05.711
All of Fonzie's favorite songs.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.813
(sobbing)

14:12.952 --> 14:16.217
Oh, Widow Fonzarelli,
I'm sorry that he...

14:16.356 --> 14:18.347
that he...

14:22.462 --> 14:24.521
It's a all right.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.860
We'll comfort each other.

14:28.334 --> 14:31.099
Oh, my, what strong arms
you have.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.002
(chuckles)
And what soft lips you have.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.769
It's all the better
to give you a kiss.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.243
Oh, you have lips like your son.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.248
It runs in the family.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.749
(sobbing continues)

14:45.885 --> 14:47.876
(gasps)

14:51.491 --> 14:52.617
That was a close one.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.523
- Will you stop it!
- Sorry.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.832
YEP, YEP, YEP, YEP-

15:11.310 --> 15:16.077
Oh, the Fonz was always
so good to me.

15:16.215 --> 15:18.616
(chuckles) I never really get
a chance to thank him.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.947
(choking up):
Me, too.

15:21.087 --> 15:24.022
We have to be brave
at a time like this.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.647
I know, I know.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.419
Oh, boy, I remember

15:27.560 --> 15:30.120
the very last things
he say to me.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.527
I was backing
out of the parking lot

15:32.665 --> 15:34.633
of Arnold's for the last time.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.861
The Fonz look at me and he say,

15:37.003 --> 15:40.633
"Don't run over my motorcycle!"

15:40.773 --> 15:43.265
(sobbing)

15:48.281 --> 15:50.841
Oh, that was beautiful.

15:50.983 --> 15:53.350
How's business, Al?

15:53.486 --> 15:55.545
Don't ask.

15:59.425 --> 16:01.450
RICHIE:
Come to pay your last respects,

16:01.594 --> 16:02.959
Officer Kirk?

16:03.095 --> 16:06.622
I came to make sure you buried
the troublemaking hood.

16:06.766 --> 16:07.699
Aaayyh ...

16:07.834 --> 16:09.768
(in high-pitched voice):
Aaayyh.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.802
Who's that?

16:11.938 --> 16:14.202
Uh, that's the Widow Fonzarelli.

16:23.616 --> 16:27.985
Thank you so much for a-coming
to my son's a-funeral.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.112
(groaning)

16:38.598 --> 16:39.724
Hey, Blue Eyes.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.265
What do you say
after the funeral,

16:41.400 --> 16:42.629
we go to a double feature?

16:42.768 --> 16:44.702
Me and me.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.102
I don't go to cartoon festivals.

17:12.431 --> 17:14.398
Well, Fonz,

17:14.534 --> 17:16.262
that was from the Big Ragoo
to you.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.871
I know that's the way you
would've wanted it.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.973
Pots, I said to the right.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.171
- This is the right.
- You're such a Potsie!

17:46.766 --> 17:49.565
Squigg, his boots died
with him off.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.567
I'm gonna miss you, Fonz.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.766
You was the nicest guy

17:56.909 --> 17:58.900
whatever beat me up.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.541
(Al sobbing)

18:10.256 --> 18:12.247
(sobbing)

18:28.341 --> 18:30.332
Where is he, Shirl?

18:32.278 --> 18:33.575
L-I don't know.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.147
Honestly.

18:35.281 --> 18:38.649
The big boss must have really
wanted him in a hurry, Laverne.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.411
Pulled him right
out of his boots.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.954
(sobbing continues)

18:43.089 --> 18:45.854
I'll never forget him.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.790
He was the only guy

18:47.927 --> 18:51.056
who ever hickeyed his initials
on my neck.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.495
That's so sweet.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.103
You can't keep
the boot, Laverne.

18:57.236 --> 18:59.000
- I want the boot.
- You can't keep the boot.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.197
- I want the boot. I want
the boot. -Drop the boot!

19:01.340 --> 19:03.331
(grunting)

19:08.981 --> 19:10.176
Listen to me, listen to me.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.478
Do you want Fonzie
to stand barefoot

19:12.618 --> 19:14.814
on that great stag line
in the sky, huh?

19:14.954 --> 19:17.423
No, he'd kill me.

19:19.925 --> 19:22.223
Oh, but I got
to leave him something, Shirl.

19:22.361 --> 19:23.988
Well, how about...

19:24.130 --> 19:25.029
No!

19:25.164 --> 19:26.359
You crazy?!

19:26.499 --> 19:27.989
My favorite sweater!

19:28.134 --> 19:29.932
No, no! No, are you nuts?

19:30.069 --> 19:31.730
This is a holy place!

19:31.871 --> 19:32.929
This is a holy place.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.403
But I want
to leave him something.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.000
There, that'll be enough.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.743
(sobbing continues)

19:42.882 --> 19:45.613
Good-bye, Fonzie's boots.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.913
Have a nice trip.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.982
Hello, Mr. Cunningham.

19:56.929 --> 20:00.832
Uh, this is
the Widow Fonzarelli.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.027
Does she know?

20:15.614 --> 20:17.139
We're very sorry.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.341
Yes.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.484
We're out of time, boss.

20:52.618 --> 20:55.883
CANDY MAN:
Finish this ceremony!

20:56.956 --> 20:58.583
Uh, no,

20:58.724 --> 20:59.714
we-we haven't sung a hymn yet.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.054
(all humming)

21:01.193 --> 21:02.251
Hymns are extra.

21:02.394 --> 21:03.361
Cut the hymns.

21:03.496 --> 21:06.193
Move out! Move out! Move out!

21:09.401 --> 21:11.301
One, two...

21:11.437 --> 21:12.734
Potsie?

21:12.872 --> 21:14.237
- Yeah.
- I said three, not two.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.432
Can't you even count?

21:16.575 --> 21:17.940
Would you stop yelling at me?

21:18.077 --> 21:19.704
I get excited and I can't think,

21:19.845 --> 21:24.339
so come on, let's just try it
one more time, okay?

21:24.483 --> 21:26.144
- Potsie?
- Hmm?

21:26.285 --> 21:28.413
How come your voice
isn't muffled like mine?

21:28.554 --> 21:30.921
Because I'm tired of talking
through this gag, that's why.

21:31.056 --> 21:32.148
I'm ti...

21:32.291 --> 21:34.020
Hey, Malph,

21:34.160 --> 21:36.458
Malph, my arm is free.

21:36.595 --> 21:39.189
Way to go, arm.

21:40.199 --> 21:43.134
(cackling)

21:47.973 --> 21:51.068
Well, it's too bad
you had to go, kid,

21:51.210 --> 21:53.269
but better you than us.

21:53.412 --> 21:55.471
So long, chump.

21:55.614 --> 21:58.083
(cackling)

21:59.618 --> 22:00.608
(gasps)

22:00.753 --> 22:02.847
(in high-pitched voice):
The chump lives.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.979
I've been had!

22:11.831 --> 22:14.493
Now, where are my buddies, huh?

22:14.633 --> 22:16.727
You balloon,
you don't give them to me soon,

22:16.869 --> 22:18.860
and I'm gonna pop you.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.537
- Fonz!
- Fonz!

22:21.674 --> 22:23.199
Fonz, we're out!

22:23.342 --> 22:25.003
- We got out!
- Wait a minute, hold it!

22:25.144 --> 22:26.134
How'd you do that?

22:26.278 --> 22:27.404
Oh, Fonz, it's great.

22:27.546 --> 22:29.571
All you got to do
is just sit here in the seat.

22:29.715 --> 22:32.844
It's great, we got to get
one of these at Arnold's, Fonz.

22:34.453 --> 22:36.717
That was a secret panel,
I understand, I understand.

22:36.856 --> 22:37.846
Sticky!

22:37.990 --> 22:39.981
Eugene!

22:40.993 --> 22:43.587
The mechanic... alive!

22:43.729 --> 22:45.959
You fool!
You fools, get him!

22:48.067 --> 22:49.728
- Come on.
- Come on.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.166
Come on!

22:51.303 --> 22:53.294
Make room for me.

22:56.842 --> 22:58.276
All right, let's go!

22:58.410 --> 23:00.071
(shouting)

23:00.212 --> 23:03.238
You found the printing press!

23:03.382 --> 23:04.543
Wait a second,
where's Fonzarelli?

23:04.683 --> 23:07.118
- With them.
- He can't handle the Candy Man.

23:07.253 --> 23:09.312
BOTH:
The Fonz can.

23:09.455 --> 23:12.049
(clattering)

23:13.192 --> 23:14.751
I knew he could do it.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.055
(thump)

23:17.062 --> 23:19.053
(laughter)

23:24.536 --> 23:25.469
Tell you something.

23:25.604 --> 23:27.265
Those creeps ate
all the marshmallows.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.397
(laughter)

23:40.286 --> 23:41.811
Hey, thanks very much.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.184
I'm sorry I had to put you
through this.

23:45.190 --> 23:47.022
Thanks for coming.

23:47.159 --> 23:49.924
Hey, I'm real sorry I had
to put you through this.

23:51.196 --> 23:53.062
Thanks for coming.

23:53.198 --> 23:54.632
I have an announcement to make.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.293
In honor of Fonzie being alive,

23:57.436 --> 24:00.633
we're staying open
one extra hour tonight!

24:00.773 --> 24:03.140
(cheering)

24:03.275 --> 24:05.073
- Hey, Rich.
- Hmm?

24:05.210 --> 24:07.975
Want to tell me the part about
how you captured the Candy Man?

24:08.113 --> 24:10.514
Well, I didn't, you know...

24:10.649 --> 24:13.482
Why don't we talk about it
at Inspiration Point?

24:13.619 --> 24:14.814
- Hey, Jennifer.
- Hmm?

24:14.954 --> 24:16.388
Jennifer, let's you and I go

24:16.522 --> 24:17.648
to Inspiration Point, huh?

24:17.790 --> 24:19.258
Oh, good idea, Potsie.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.883
Yeah, you can tie me up,
and I'll show you how I escaped.

24:22.895 --> 24:23.919
What about me?

24:24.063 --> 24:25.053
I was there, too.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.562
Joanie, Joanie,
don't you want to hear

24:26.699 --> 24:28.258
how I helped capture
the Candy Man?

24:28.400 --> 24:29.834
(chuckles)
Right, Ralph.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.631
Right after I tell you
about my date with Ricky Nelson.

24:36.675 --> 24:39.906
BOTH:
She's dating Ricky Nelson?

24:42.614 --> 24:44.878
(snaps)
Malph, get over here.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.007
Yeah, Fonz.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.585
Take over for me, will you?

24:47.720 --> 24:49.688
