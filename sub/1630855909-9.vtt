WEBVTT

00:04.587 --> 00:06.464
Hello? Hello?

00:08.675 --> 00:11.094
- Hello, Jerry.
- Nana!

00:11.094 --> 00:13.054
Are you ready to come to the light?

00:13.054 --> 00:15.598
I’m not sure. Where’s Pop Pop?

00:15.932 --> 00:17.934
He’s not coming out to meet you anymore

00:17.934 --> 00:20.979
because honestly Jerry,
this is getting annoying.

00:20.979 --> 00:24.399
It’s not my fault! My father in law
asked me to help him gather data and...

00:25.108 --> 00:27.444
Not again!

00:28.236 --> 00:29.612
Okay, run diagnostics.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.701
Holy shit, this is consistent.
This is real.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.703
What have you done?
You’ve got my grandparents

00:36.703 --> 00:39.289
- pissed at me.
- They’ll forgive you because...

00:39.289 --> 00:42.125
they’re zero mass fields
of consciousness preserved

00:42.125 --> 00:45.086
by a paradimensional layer
of infinite energy.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.255
Morty, there’s kind of a heaven!
Kind of!

00:47.255 --> 00:50.091
I mean there definitely is for
a neurotypical like your father.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.677
His conscious connection
to a localized cultural model

00:52.677 --> 00:55.138
of infinity functions like a wick,
sucking his little mind

00:55.138 --> 00:56.890
straight towards a source of energy
strong enough

00:56.890 --> 00:59.642
- to support collective projection.
- Great, so there’s a heaven.

00:59.976 --> 01:02.729
Glad you could learn that
by murdering me eight times.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.147
He’s got kind of a point, Rick.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.858
If you want to get into heaven,
can’t you just stop being an asshole?

01:06.858 --> 01:09.652
First of all, I don’t want to
“get into” anywhere,

01:09.652 --> 01:11.529
I want to tap
this paradimension’s energy.

01:11.529 --> 01:14.908
Secondly, you wouldn’t catch me dead
in Jerry’s generic-ass nineteen eighties

01:14.908 --> 01:16.493
concrete and fog machine heaven.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.828
Well guess what,
you aren’t welcome there!

01:18.828 --> 01:21.623
You raise a good point, Jerry,
obviously by accident.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.500
My intact consciousness is too atheistic

01:23.500 --> 01:25.752
to get channeled
to any afterlife worth robbing.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.128
It’s a paradox.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.130
Unless...

01:30.590 --> 01:33.468
Morty, pack your parka.
We’re going to Norway.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.721
Or I can augment your skin
with subdermal heaters...

01:36.721 --> 01:37.847
I’ll pack a parka.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.882
Infinite energy, Morty. You don’t even
know how to appreciate that

02:12.882 --> 02:14.676
because you’ve never been
in energy debt.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.010
Fuck you, I’ve been tired.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.721
Perfect!
I’m going to Valhalla, Morty!

02:18.721 --> 02:20.640
Your grandpa’s
going to be the first Valhallanaut!

02:20.974 --> 02:22.058
Feel the excitement!

02:22.767 --> 02:25.520
Getting back will be easy.
Once the machine turns on,

02:25.520 --> 02:27.230
I’ll have set up
the other side of the relay.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.065
Phoenix protocol initiated.

02:29.065 --> 02:31.359
Just hit that big red button
to pull me into this body.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.737
But how are you getting there?
I refuse to kill you again.

02:34.737 --> 02:38.116
I’m desensitized, Rick.
I took some kind of test in school

02:38.116 --> 02:40.618
and the counselor
had to call Homeland Security.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.744
Not your problem, Morty.

02:41.744 --> 02:44.247
I need to die in glorious battle
against a mighty enemy.

02:44.789 --> 02:46.875
That’s why I got Bigfoot
in this Pokeball.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.084
Bigfoot is your enemy?

02:48.084 --> 02:50.587
Well, I doubt he’s a fan,
I stuffed him into a ball.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.255
I mess with him all the time.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.340
These Vikings don’t have
real tight bylaws, Morty.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.844
This is basically their equivalent
of Native American burial grounds.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.221
Bigfoot’s dumb enough
to attack whatever’s in front of him.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.848
And all I gotta do is die.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.225
What happens to Bigfoot after?

03:04.225 --> 03:08.396
Morty, Bigfoot is a B story. The A story
is he kills me and you hit the button.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.689
- Got it?
- Got it.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.775
Alright, let’s do this!

03:38.301 --> 03:41.971
Oh snap, I did it! Valhalla baby!
I’m Dead Rick!

03:44.933 --> 03:46.309
Oh, shit, I’m dead Rick.

03:51.439 --> 03:55.485
Welcome to Valhalla, brother.
We thought all Vikings had perished.

03:55.485 --> 03:59.489
Nope. I was a straggler.
How’s it work here again?

03:59.489 --> 04:03.493
We fight! We die! We feast!
And then we fight again!

04:04.243 --> 04:05.912
Cheers everybody, cheers!

04:07.288 --> 04:09.749
So, is there a time window
between battles

04:09.749 --> 04:11.960
where a guy could go off
and, I don’t know,

04:12.293 --> 04:13.503
gather resources?

04:13.503 --> 04:16.005
Yes, now you’ll receive your armor.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.008
Knock knock.

04:20.259 --> 04:22.720
You’re a new arrival.
What do you require?

04:22.720 --> 04:25.014
Honestly, I’d love to take
most of your tools.

04:25.014 --> 04:27.350
I’d planned on starting from scratch,
but you’re, like,

04:27.350 --> 04:30.061
way past the Iron Age here,
saves me a lot of time.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.397
I make only the finest for Valhalla.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.065
Beautiful hammer.

04:34.065 --> 04:37.026
So, in Valhalla, what happens
when we get knocked out?

04:37.026 --> 04:38.945
- Then we’re just knocked out.
- Cool.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.864
Is that a thing Vikings love?

04:50.289 --> 04:51.749
Oh God, brutal.

04:58.923 --> 05:02.510
Wait, what?
Bigfoot, do you have religion?

05:03.511 --> 05:08.057
<i>You understand me, don’t you?
Does Rick do this to you all the time?</i>

05:10.226 --> 05:11.602
<i>He messes with me too.</i>

05:13.229 --> 05:15.356
Easy there, big guy. Easy.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.087
Oh, shit!

05:42.550 --> 05:44.218
Look at this little one!

05:44.218 --> 05:48.097
You must be made of piss and dragon
balls to reach Valhalla at your age!

05:48.097 --> 05:51.476
Yeah, man! Dragon Balls all day.

05:51.976 --> 05:54.771
Have you seen
an old skinny guy around here?

05:54.771 --> 05:55.938
Of course!

05:56.439 --> 05:59.067
But wait, where did that guy go?
He should have his armor by now.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.613
What in the mighty
whale’s wooden cock?

06:04.405 --> 06:06.949
The old man!
He’s some kind of witch!

06:07.408 --> 06:09.160
A friend of yours?

06:09.160 --> 06:11.245
What? Why would I be friends
with a witch?

06:11.245 --> 06:12.622
- I was just asking!
- Well...

06:12.622 --> 06:15.625
that’s really offensive, man!
What is this, Judgmenthalla?

06:15.625 --> 06:17.585
I don’t know until I ask, alright?

06:17.585 --> 06:19.128
Somebody around here
gonna make me some pants

06:19.128 --> 06:21.214
or do I have to call the feds
on this place?

06:22.507 --> 06:25.593
Surrender, witch!

06:26.636 --> 06:29.305
Easy, guys.
This was all a test and you passed.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.306
I’m actually Odin.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.557
- Odin?
- Yep!

06:31.557 --> 06:33.643
Thor’s father, Spiderman’s uncle,
et cetera.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.645
I came here to do like
an undercover boss thing,

06:35.645 --> 06:39.107
making sure Valhalla's running smooth,
which it is, and as your reward,

06:39.107 --> 06:42.151
I’m assembling this
majestic transdimensional energy relay

06:42.151 --> 06:44.487
which none of you should ever touch
or it’ll make your...

06:44.946 --> 06:47.448
goats have hemorrhoids, understood?

06:47.782 --> 06:49.742
And you need nothing from us?

06:49.742 --> 06:51.661
I’m only here a few hours,
but since you’re asking

06:51.661 --> 06:54.872
I’d kill for a beer and a sandwich.
Beef, cheese, no onions.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.165
- is someone writing this down?
- Ow my balls!

06:56.165 --> 06:59.460
- Ow my balls, ow my balls!
- Morty? Why are you here?

06:59.460 --> 07:01.629
You are friends with the witch!

07:03.631 --> 07:05.508
What the fuck, Morty!
You’re my ride home!

07:05.508 --> 07:07.844
Bigfoot killed me!
He killed you, he killed me,

07:07.844 --> 07:09.470
and he was going to kill your clone.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.514
No, Morty no!

07:11.514 --> 07:14.225
I opened the cage.
Bigfoot was burying your body.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.477
- He was mourning you!
- He does that.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.855
Morty, any big idiot can
pretend to believe in the afterlife,

07:18.855 --> 07:20.857
that’s why we’re dealing
with these fucking guys.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.317
They’re just Norwegian Bigfoots.
Jesus Christ!

07:23.317 --> 07:25.319
Run this cable over there.
We don’t have much time.

07:35.997 --> 07:39.834
<i>Hull breach imminent.
Initiating survival protocol.</i>

08:15.119 --> 08:16.370
We’ll take it from here.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.790
And who are you? CIA? Interpol?

08:19.790 --> 08:22.084
We work for the man upstairs.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.757
Hello, Bigfoot. I’m The Pope.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.176
I’m sure you don’t know
what that means.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.471
Which is why I’ve been so eager
to acquire you.

08:33.804 --> 08:38.267
The Church, you see, has many enemies,
but also many rules.

08:38.267 --> 08:41.354
We can’t kill.
We can’t command a man to kill.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.147
But you are not a man.

08:43.147 --> 08:46.651
You are a thinking beast
from outside God’s domain,

08:47.026 --> 08:50.696
which will make you
the Vatican’s greatest weapon.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.157
Your holiness, he is wild.
He can’t be controlled.

08:53.157 --> 08:55.993
But we know what he wants.

08:59.080 --> 09:03.876
Yes, my child. Yes.
You will have your naked imbecile.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.463
But first you will work for me.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.969
Morty! Heads up! Incoming wave.

09:20.017 --> 09:20.935
Clear!

09:21.936 --> 09:23.771
- They’re sending more every time.
- It’s fine!

09:23.771 --> 09:26.691
I’ll upgrade the turret’s rate of fire,
but I need to finish this relay.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.526
You need to figure out
how to get us back to life!

09:28.526 --> 09:30.152
Without my infinite energy?

09:30.152 --> 09:31.946
I don’t think you’re thinking
this through, Morty.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.490
If we manage to get home,
we don’t get another shot at this.

09:34.490 --> 09:37.118
You think the next time these idiots
see a naked man on the battlefield

09:37.118 --> 09:38.160
they’re gonna give him a beer?

09:38.536 --> 09:41.914
So you’d rather stay dead until
you win than live as a loser?

09:41.914 --> 09:44.000
Maybe you belong here
with these idiots.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.210
Yeah! I could probably teach hem
how to hit a red button!

09:46.586 --> 09:47.628
I said I was sorry.

09:47.628 --> 09:51.549
And I said keep killing them
while I finish the relay.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.884
And I will get us back home. Okay?

09:54.510 --> 09:55.428
Okay!

10:25.291 --> 10:27.543
Okay, I’m done here.
Ready to get back to living?

10:27.543 --> 10:28.544
Yeah, but how?

10:28.544 --> 10:30.921
Morty, infinite energy
means infinite energy.

10:30.921 --> 10:33.883
All I have to do is pull a lever
to send us back home into new bodies.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.885
Then voila! No more need for crystals.

10:35.885 --> 10:39.221
But the second we turn our back those
guys are just going to trash this place.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.182
Morty. Ye of little faith.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.602
Do we even need to attack him?

10:57.656 --> 11:00.368
I told you I was Odin,
you faithless heretics!

11:00.368 --> 11:02.411
And I’ll keep blowing you
up in this pit forever

11:02.411 --> 11:04.997
unless you follow these commandments.
Spiderman?

11:05.998 --> 11:07.750
There’s ten of them,
but they basically

11:07.750 --> 11:10.628
revolve around not going
near the energy relay.

11:10.628 --> 11:14.006
Is anybody going to go near
the energy relay?

11:15.007 --> 11:18.010
Okay. You have pleased me.
I’ll get you guys...

11:18.677 --> 11:19.762
some kind of a ladder.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.431
Target is in sight.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.184
Excellent. Release the bait.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.731
I just love worshipping the devil
with you guys.

11:47.540 --> 11:51.127
Who are you? Only The Pope
wants to kill us but he can't kill...

11:54.588 --> 11:56.382
Yes. Very good.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.510
But we can do even better.

12:03.055 --> 12:08.060
You work for the Vatican!
Our enemies are your enemies!

12:15.901 --> 12:17.736
Yes! Yes!

12:23.033 --> 12:26.203
Here, my sweet.
This will help you communicate.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.540
I traded a Predator
three muskets for it.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.375
So it is their currency?

12:32.334 --> 12:34.044
<i>Give me what you promised.</i>

12:34.378 --> 12:36.797
Yes, child, you’ve earned it.

12:37.631 --> 12:39.800
Alright, Morty!
Wanna grab a mead for the road?

12:39.800 --> 12:42.052
- I’m good.
- Then, here we go!

12:49.018 --> 12:52.021
Man, I take back everything bad I said
about clone vats.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.689
There’s a method to the madness, Morty.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.360
And now... infinite energy, baby!

13:00.779 --> 13:01.697
What the...

13:02.239 --> 13:04.575
Someone’s hacking into the Earth
bound side of my relay, Morty.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.369
Pretty crazy! Whoever’s doing this
would have to be a spiritual leader

13:07.369 --> 13:08.871
with limitless resources.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.789
In fact,
I guess there’s only really one.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.795
<i>You’re fucked.</i>

13:20.257 --> 13:22.927
<i>It is over. My torment ends now.</i>

13:26.180 --> 13:29.308
What the hell? Are you seriously
working for the Pope?

13:29.308 --> 13:33.395
<i>The pope saw my potential.
Prepare to be crushed by bigfoot.</i>

13:38.150 --> 13:40.402
Don’t worry, Morty.
I’ve got this under control.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.823
Jesus Christ, Rick, just apologize.

13:44.823 --> 13:47.451
You assumed Bigfoot was dumb.
Which was dumb of you.

13:47.451 --> 13:50.579
You’re right, Morty. Underestimating
people only gives them the high ground.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.040
<i>Admit why you bullied me.</i>

13:53.040 --> 13:55.376
Because I thought it was funny
that you were stupid.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.712
<i>People are intelligent
in different ways.</i>

13:58.712 --> 14:02.508
I know, I know! I’m clearly stupid at
knowing when other people are smart.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.929
Listen! I know you
can’t tap your gauntlet,

14:06.929 --> 14:08.931
but I’ll take a guess
at what you’re saying.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.433
You hate me because I tortured you
to get what I want.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.353
- Rick!
- But I only used you to kill myself!

14:14.687 --> 14:16.647
How many people
have you killed for the Pope?

14:18.315 --> 14:19.942
Help me stop him
and I’ll make it right.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.319
For starters, here.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.739
<i>That hurt. Wait a second...</i>

14:25.739 --> 14:28.576
Yeah, hands-free.
Also upgraded that voice.

14:28.576 --> 14:33.122
<i>Thank you. In a world,
where time actually is money.</i>

14:33.122 --> 14:34.623
I think I know this movie.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.625
You guys can do this
bit at the Vatican. Let’s go.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.130
Hey, Bigfoot.
Whatcha got back there?

14:41.130 --> 14:42.506
<i>Rick and Morty.</i>

14:44.216 --> 14:45.801
<i>Dead. For pope.</i>

14:45.801 --> 14:47.303
Aye, that’s them.

14:48.887 --> 14:52.308
Alright, last thing!
I just gotta take a sharp stick

14:52.308 --> 14:55.227
and stab them both.
That’s just the rules.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.859
Sorry, Morty!
So much for the quiet way.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.320
- I appreciate that we tried.
<i>- It’s a fucked-up rule.</i>

15:11.493 --> 15:14.246
Pope!

15:17.541 --> 15:19.460
It’s over, the Pope! We got you.

15:24.548 --> 15:25.924
See, this is why religion sucks.

15:25.924 --> 15:28.886
Infinite energy and the Pope uses it
to levitate like Criss Angel.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.725
Alright, wow!
Not how I saw that going.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.687
I guess getting killed by the energy
sent us up the conduit to its source.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.023
Hey guys.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.691
- Oh fuck!
- No, no!

15:43.025 --> 15:46.153
Just need some clothes and horses.
Maybe not for Bigfoot.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.030
Unless he wants clothes?

15:51.241 --> 15:53.702
Excuse me, Lord Odin...

15:53.702 --> 15:56.830
- Is this a test?
- Yup yup! You passed!

16:04.838 --> 16:06.757
Feet so small.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.258
Why is he in a clone of Summer?

16:08.258 --> 16:11.011
Statistically speaking,
she’s the third most likely to die.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.013
Alright, let’s kill that sonofabitch.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.807
Hold on,
I can see where this is going.

16:23.857 --> 16:26.151
Pope!

16:51.009 --> 16:53.095
I gotta admit, Morty.
I didn’t really fight that time,

16:53.095 --> 16:54.430
I wanted to make sure this worked.

16:54.430 --> 16:57.474
- Hand-some.
- You like that? Bigger feet!

16:57.474 --> 16:59.268
Even gave your brain
a little more lobe.

16:59.268 --> 17:02.187
- Thank you! Me love it. Me...
- Dial it back!

17:02.187 --> 17:03.897
You don’t wanna come across
like a Muppet.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.237
Pope!

17:21.665 --> 17:23.542
Maybe we just portal
right up close to the guy

17:23.542 --> 17:25.043
instead of doing the guards
every time.

17:25.586 --> 17:26.503
Yeah.

17:37.055 --> 17:38.390
Maybe bigger chin?

17:38.390 --> 17:39.975
Look at this.
He’s fucking giving notes.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.811
Bigfoot, come on, we need you
to put a little more fight in.

17:42.811 --> 17:45.522
If need help,
Bigfoot do know some guys.

17:45.522 --> 17:48.484
Pope has... other monsters captive.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.696
Man, you guys really don’t quit.
I can do this all day.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.364
Yeah, but these guys can do it.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.409
All night!

18:06.543 --> 18:08.629
Big anti-climax!

18:09.379 --> 18:10.756
Mummy, you look good!

18:10.756 --> 18:13.217
This afterlife smells like beer.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.886
I guess this is what
infinite energy looks like. Fuck.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.306
Really wish we had time to unpack all
of Frankenstein’s parts making it here.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.434
Bigfoot, take these guys up to
the relay and prepare for a siege.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.602
What are you gonna do, Rick?

18:23.977 --> 18:26.105
Listen, I’m not really your god.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.357
Just an old man
who wanted to cheat your system.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.983
Guys like me think
we can run the joint

18:29.983 --> 18:32.820
because everyone is so dumb.
But it’s a dumb universe.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.947
I work for you.
The customer is always right.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.157
Gimme ten Viking minutes
after we leave,

18:37.157 --> 18:39.451
and then pull the plug on
that windmill we made over there.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.454
And this isn’t a trick?

18:42.454 --> 18:43.872
Is your mother’s pussy a trick?

18:44.498 --> 18:46.083
- Kick his ass!
- Go Morty, go!

18:46.917 --> 18:48.335
Why the hell did you do that?

18:48.752 --> 18:50.921
The only way to end this
is by turning off the power, Morty!

18:50.921 --> 18:53.757
- But we have to get home!
- That’s what these guys are for!

18:53.757 --> 18:57.135
Monsters, hold the line!
Everyone but Bigfoot!

19:01.807 --> 19:03.517
That wasn’t them leaving, right?

19:03.517 --> 19:05.769
No way. That vould be cold-blooded.

19:06.770 --> 19:09.273
Pope!

19:10.023 --> 19:13.610
Who do you-a bring this time?
The Harlem Globetrotters?

19:13.610 --> 19:14.945
That’s actually a good pitch.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.196
It’s over for you, Pope!

19:16.196 --> 19:18.448
Time to atone for your sins.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.326
Bigfoot,
you were God’s greatest assassin.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.288
Now look at you.
Hairless. With normal feet.

19:24.663 --> 19:25.581
Yes!

19:26.707 --> 19:28.834
Rick, the energy relay’s still up!

19:28.834 --> 19:31.253
Shit, was really counting on
those monsters to lose faster.

19:33.463 --> 19:35.632
That’s more like it.
Pour one out for the Wolfman.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.302
- I don’t-a understand.
- Ya know what they say...

19:38.302 --> 19:40.637
When God closes an infinite energy relay

19:40.637 --> 19:43.599
No! Goddamnit!

19:52.524 --> 19:54.568
Alright, I’m just gonna say it
so nobody else has to say it.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.779
- Popey ball. There.
- Okay.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.823
If I didn’t say anything,
someone was gonna be like

19:59.823 --> 20:01.658
“You missed Popey ball,
it was right there”.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.703
I thought about not using a Pokeball
because of that,

20:04.703 --> 20:06.788
but it’s the right tool
for the right job.

20:07.122 --> 20:09.958
What, am I supposed to not use it
and shoot the Pope in the head?

20:11.376 --> 20:12.294
I was gonna say it.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.590
Wait, why are we at the woods?

20:17.090 --> 20:19.009
Time to go on home, big fella.

20:20.677 --> 20:22.846
- Okay.
- You’re free. Just go!

20:22.846 --> 20:25.557
- You guys are being weird.
- Stop making this so hard for us!

20:25.557 --> 20:27.976
Go on! Why can’t you go back
where you came from?

20:28.810 --> 20:31.271
You don’t have to throw things at me
to say goodbye.

20:31.271 --> 20:32.439
Just go!

20:32.439 --> 20:36.109
I’m not an animal anymore,
I was hoping I could...

20:36.485 --> 20:37.819
I could get a job and...

20:37.819 --> 20:39.613
- Go on git!
- Get out of here!

20:39.947 --> 20:43.992
I’m going, okay?
Stop throwing things!

20:44.910 --> 20:46.203
- Go!
- Okay, I’m leaving.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.829
- Get out of here!
- Go on, get!

21:40.298 --> 21:43.093
- What kind of sick sons of bitches...
- These things are trained to fight.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.636
I don’t want to hear it, Henderson.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.764
What year is it? Who’s the Pope?

21:47.764 --> 21:50.058
Shit if I know. Lemme check.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.227
This guy, apparently.

21:53.812 --> 21:57.065
No!
