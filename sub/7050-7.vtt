WEBVTT

00:02.086 --> 00:04.420
Previously on Justified...

00:05.089 --> 00:06.631
- Evening.
- Where's Ellen May?

00:06.757 --> 00:09.926
One of my deputies
saw a girl who fits Ellen May's description

00:10.135 --> 00:11.928
get waved over to an 18-wheeler.

00:14.598 --> 00:16.432
- Damn it!
- I don't know where Ellen May is,

00:16.558 --> 00:18.559
and your smacking me around
ain't gonna change that!

00:18.644 --> 00:21.020
I swear I am not Drew Thompson.

00:21.105 --> 00:22.397
That's not what Arlo Givens says.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.607
Well, Arlo Givens is a lying sack of shit!

00:25.150 --> 00:28.277
I don't know why Josiah told you
Drew's still up here.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.863
Only time I seen him
since he left was near 10 years ago

00:30.948 --> 00:32.490
at the bluegrass festival,

00:32.616 --> 00:35.076
rubbing shoulders with the mayor,
judge executive.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.745
All them rich Clover Hill folks.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.707
How do you think
we're gonna get into Napier's party?

00:40.791 --> 00:42.625
He'd shoot me before I got through the door.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.503
Not if we use Arnold to get us an invite.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.171
I'll handle Napier.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.924
You just consider yourself invited.
Both of you.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.635
Jody Adair,
charged with double homicide.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.804
He's got an ex-wife in Lexington.

00:54.972 --> 00:57.640
You put eyes on him,
I'll make it worth your while.

01:00.144 --> 01:01.644
This could be a little uncomfortable.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.229
Just be cool and go with it.

01:03.313 --> 01:06.482
I get out of these,
I'll tear you to pieces small enough to flush.

01:06.775 --> 01:09.193
Look, I ain't here on Marshals' business.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.988
I just want to know
about the man in the trunk.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.209
Unconstitutional, man. I got to piss.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.628
ACLU be happy to take up your case.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.173
- Let's go, brother.
- Suck my dick, brother.

01:32.468 --> 01:33.634
Nice work, Givens.

01:34.178 --> 01:35.803
Always looking to fill up the piggy bank.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.680
As you like it.

01:38.307 --> 01:40.224
Besides, a good man's hard to find.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.310
I don't know what to say.
You found me so easy.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.187
Your cell still best?

01:44.354 --> 01:46.564
If you're in town,
just stop by the High Note Bar.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.149
Pretty well living there these days.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.319
I hope you're not drinking away your wages.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.362
It would ravage those Hollywood looks.

01:53.739 --> 01:56.240
- We good, Sharon?
- We're good, Raylan.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.534
- It's good to see you.
- Likewise.

02:01.747 --> 02:05.708
Playing behind the beat, all cool,
making the girl do all the flirting.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.252
Shit only flies
if you're a pretty boy like Eastwood there.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.003
See, Raylan there, he's got the badge

02:10.088 --> 02:12.840
and the drawl
and the whole squinty, sexy thing,

02:12.925 --> 02:15.259
and there was a time
I would have run right to him,

02:15.385 --> 02:17.053
done the whole merry-go-round.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.597
Now I see that for what it is, and

02:20.724 --> 02:22.517
him for who he is.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.853
That man's an emotional disaster.

02:26.230 --> 02:27.855
Sharon, you gonna die an old maid.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.692
What is that?

02:33.862 --> 02:35.404
Looks like we lost the rear tyre.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.909
Be a doll and fix it.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.744
- You gonna get all girly on me now?
- Girly?

02:41.870 --> 02:44.580
Honey, I'm gonna cop a squat.
You know I drank all 36 ounces.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.749
Mr Pibb?
Lord, how do you drink any ounces?

02:46.875 --> 02:48.459
Nectar of the gods.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.092
Yeah, make it snappy.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.940
What's up, man? You need a hand?

03:11.066 --> 03:12.316
All good, friend.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.652
I got AAA. If you want, I can make a call.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.404
They'll be here in 20, 30 minutes.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.905
It's time to move on.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.200
- You understand?
- Yeah.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.452
Some thanks I get
for being a Good Samaritan.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.788
I don't mean no offence. For your own safety.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.082
All right.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.749
- Where is she?
- You said poke out the tyre,

04:09.833 --> 04:10.917
which I did when they got food,

04:11.001 --> 04:12.877
but you didn't say anything
about killing nobody!

04:13.003 --> 04:14.337
Tell me where she went.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.380
I'm just a filmmaker.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.382
Kennet!

04:20.510 --> 04:23.554
You don't tell me where she went,
I'll kill your ass.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.491
Kennet!

05:24.199 --> 05:25.324
Already signed that.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.077
Dunlop's birthday card.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.955
This is the summary
of those 20 boxes they gave us.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.166
- It's bullshit.
- That's not just bullshit, Raylan.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.961
That is rare, vintage FBI bullshit.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.254
That's a whole different bouquet.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.548
Drew Thompson is a 30-year-old case.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.216
They expect us to believe that?

05:42.300 --> 05:45.011
I tried to call Barkley
and chew his ass out about it,

05:45.095 --> 05:47.555
but he's been AWOL for a few days.
Hasn't been to work.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.890
Since when does
J. Edgar Barkley miss work?

05:49.975 --> 05:51.350
Anyway, we don't need the FBI.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.936
We can dig ourselves
through all those Clover Hill names

05:54.021 --> 05:57.148
that your cousin Mary
and the one-legged man gave us.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.191
One-footed. Still got most of his leg.

05:59.276 --> 06:02.319
You're doing that thing that makes me
believe you don't have high hopes.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.988
- That eyebrow thing?
- Yeah.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.532
'Cause I don't have high hopes.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.826
I mean, what have we got?

06:08.952 --> 06:12.705
We got 20 worthless boxes
and the Hill woman's riddles

06:12.873 --> 06:15.541
and the ravings of a one-footed man.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.043
Tell me we shouldn't lose hope.

06:17.169 --> 06:18.919
- We shouldn't lose hope.
- Why not?

06:19.087 --> 06:21.881
Well, maybe that
psychic friend of yours, Eve Munro,

06:22.007 --> 06:24.425
she could look through
all those DMV photos of everybody

06:24.509 --> 06:27.053
that fits Drew's description
and maybe hit the jackpot.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.637
Good Lord.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.931
You know,
instead of just sitting around here...

06:31.016 --> 06:32.475
- I ain't going.
- Just hear me out.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.519
I don't want to see Arlo,
let alone have that same conversation.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.354
I'm not saying go see your father.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.648
I'm saying go down to Tramble

06:39.733 --> 06:42.026
and talk to that guy
who used to be the Harlan sheriff.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.569
- Hunter.
- Right.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.821
One-footed Josiah mentioned him, didn't he?

06:45.947 --> 06:47.031
He did.

06:47.115 --> 06:50.242
Well, just go talk to him, and then after that,
go talk to your father.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.368
Art...

06:51.495 --> 06:52.870
He knows who and where Drew is.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.663
- He won't...
- It's easy, Raylan.

06:54.790 --> 06:55.873
You just stuff that file,

06:55.999 --> 06:57.958
tell him we've got
all the evidence that we need,

06:58.043 --> 06:59.627
and then you give him a little nudge

06:59.836 --> 07:01.921
or a thinly veiled threat, and he'll spook.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.130
He won't.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.507
Well, then you give him a sob story.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.717
You know, tell him you don't
want to see him die in prison.

07:07.511 --> 07:10.012
Raylan, go see your father.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.893
Where do we keep
the folder for take-out menus?

07:15.977 --> 07:17.686
Over by the copy machine.

07:18.730 --> 07:19.855
You working lunch?

07:20.065 --> 07:21.732
Go get 'em, tiger!

07:25.112 --> 07:26.612
Happy birthday, Nelson.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.572
Thanks, Raylan.

07:29.741 --> 07:30.825
Believe that?

07:30.909 --> 07:32.034
He wished me a happy birthday.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.954
Jesus Christ, Nelson.
I'm sorry I forgot your birthday.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.710
It's nice just laying here.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.213
Feel safe.

07:44.756 --> 07:48.425
That boy that beat on you the other day,
I gave him a whooping he won't soon forget.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.054
I didn't like doing it.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.559
But it needed doing. For you.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.520
You ain't just saying that?

08:01.231 --> 08:03.440
You are not like the other girls.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.235
You got a light in your eyes.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.904
I'd be lying
if I said I didn't feel that way about you

08:08.989 --> 08:10.197
the first time I saw you.

08:10.866 --> 08:13.951
Wasn't two days ago
you were all up in my face.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.911
Now you come over
and get something-something

08:15.996 --> 08:17.538
and you want to romance me, too?

08:18.039 --> 08:20.249
Just tell me what you want.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.459
Hey.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.213
I want to know who put the hurt on you.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.382
It wasn't Max, so who?

08:28.758 --> 08:30.176
What do you care?

08:32.636 --> 08:33.929
See, now...

08:34.972 --> 08:38.601
I didn't know it wasn't Max 100%,
but right there, you just made me sure of it.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.269
Shit, Johnny.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.730
So, who could it be?

08:44.274 --> 08:47.276
Who do I know and you know

08:47.736 --> 08:50.487
could scare you into shutting up?

08:52.490 --> 08:55.993
Damn it, Johnny. Leave it alone.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.457
Was it Colt?

09:02.834 --> 09:04.752
Yeah, it was Colt.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.337
I did not say that name.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.881
- No, you did not.
- You swear on that.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.133
He said he'd cut out my damn tongue.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.093
Now, why would he say something like that,

09:13.178 --> 09:15.721
not to mention
beat you and scare you half to death?

09:15.847 --> 09:19.433
He was tweaking and pissed off,
asking about Ellen May.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.728
Ellen May?

09:23.271 --> 09:26.065
Where she is or did she call or some shit.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.610
Forget exactly.
He kind of punched me right after.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.079
I meant what I said, Teri.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.130
- Givens.
- Deputy Givens,

09:50.215 --> 09:52.299
Loren Hunkis,
Campbell county sheriff's deputy.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.843
- How can I help you?
- You were one of the last incoming calls

09:54.928 --> 09:56.595
on the cell phone of Sharon Edmunds.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.764
Can you tell me
what association you had with her.

09:58.848 --> 09:59.890
Had?

09:59.975 --> 10:02.851
Fished her van out of Norris Lake
around 6:00 this morning.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.521
Two bodies in the vehicle,
one of which was Ms Edmunds.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.689
Damn.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.108
Decomp suggests
they've been dead about six days.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.276
Six days?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.111
I hazard a guess it wasn't a car crash?

10:12.195 --> 10:14.071
Got one body with defensive wounds.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.823
- Appears to have been strangled.
- Jesus.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.492
The other, Ms Edmunds,
had a fatal gunshot wound to the neck.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.412
I think I know the man you're looking for.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.923
Don't take this the wrong way, Jody.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.592
You know I love you
and I think you're a genius,

10:35.677 --> 10:36.969
but you got to get the hell out.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.804
I can't go anywhere, Kennet.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.723
Look at me. I'm in pain, brother.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.434
Just let the meds kick in. You'll be straight.

10:43.518 --> 10:46.729
They kept you well this long.
Then you can go hit up your old lady.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.231
She already messed up my shit.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.066
I got to heal before I can go get with Katrina.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.568
Six days now

10:52.819 --> 10:55.237
you've been healing all over my couch.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.573
- I think you're good.
- Hey, hey.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.158
Pack me a bowl, would you?

11:00.910 --> 11:02.161
I helped out like you asked.

11:02.245 --> 11:04.788
I jabbed the tyres in that van.
I came to your rescue.

11:04.956 --> 11:08.125
But you add two bodies
to the two dope dealers in Knoxville.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.543
That's four killings in under a month.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.211
I'm not cut out for that. I'm a filmmaker!

11:11.463 --> 11:15.007
Let me tell you something
so you can stop your bitch-ass complaining.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.677
I don't want to go
to see Katrina per se, you dig?

11:18.845 --> 11:22.806
I'm gonna go get the goddamn money
I got stashed at Katrina's.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.267
Say what?

11:25.602 --> 11:28.187
Do I have your attention now,
Steven Spielberg?

11:28.271 --> 11:29.396
You left the money part out.

11:29.481 --> 11:32.107
Yes, so you didn't grab it up
while I was convalescing.

11:32.442 --> 11:36.320
So, new deal... I sit a few days.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.697
You take me over. We get the money.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.950
I cut you in 20/80 for your trouble.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.327
How much we talking?

11:43.495 --> 11:44.912
Enough you can finally make your big movie.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.622
- What's it called?
- "The Last..."

11:49.084 --> 11:50.376
Hello?

11:52.128 --> 11:53.337
Yeah.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.092
Well, I... I couldn't say. Not well.

11:58.510 --> 12:01.678
I sold her some stuff on craigslist.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.932
Cameras, lenses, stuff like that.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.559
No problem, deputy.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.728
What was that shit?

12:09.813 --> 12:12.648
That was the police
asking me how I know Sharon Edmunds.

12:12.857 --> 12:13.899
What did you say?

12:13.983 --> 12:17.152
What difference does it make, man?
They know, Jody!

12:19.531 --> 12:21.907
Well, I'm healed. Let's go.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.832
Always hated that house.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.292
Come on, man. Let's go.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.757
Look at that.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.593
Can you believe this? She put in an alarm.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.012
All right, let's go around back.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.598
That's what I'm saying.

12:55.358 --> 12:56.608
Shit!

12:59.696 --> 13:01.280
Katrina's sister.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.323
She's white.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.367
Her sorority sister at Butler.

13:05.702 --> 13:09.204
We are lucky. If she's here, we can get in,
no fuss, no muss.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.706
All right, fine. Good.

13:10.832 --> 13:11.874
Let's make it quick, though.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.960
No, no, no, not that man, not him.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.004
- You know him?
- Know him. I hate him.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.213
Hello, cowboy.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.132
- Who are you?
- Jackie Nevada.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.010
I'm a grad student at UK,
just house-sitting for my girlfriend.

13:23.178 --> 13:26.054
Reason I'm here, Miss Nevada, we have

13:26.139 --> 13:29.057
cause to believe that Katrina's
ex-husband might be coming here

13:29.184 --> 13:30.392
for her and the kids.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.978
He's armed and dangerous and an asshole.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.230
I've met him. You got three for three.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.733
Katrina took the kids to Dollywood,

13:37.817 --> 13:40.152
which, if you know Katrina,
you know is hilarious.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.821
She say where she was staying
or leave an itinerary?

13:42.906 --> 13:44.364
I probably have an e-mail on my phone.

13:46.743 --> 13:49.661
I'm thinking
I'm gonna get my money and kill that man.

13:49.746 --> 13:50.829
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no, no,

13:50.914 --> 13:51.997
it's a good idea, Kennet.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.165
LPD.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.417
Let's go. Come on. We'll get the car later.

13:58.755 --> 13:59.838
Jim.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.173
House-sitter's inside.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.925
I got time. I can get her home,

14:03.009 --> 14:05.677
but she'll give you
all the details on the wife and kids first.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.596
Good. Great.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.270
Are you sure it's here?

14:15.396 --> 14:17.022
Well, I don't know why it wouldn't be.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.608
It's not showing up anywhere else.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.362
Baby.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.702
Mystery solved.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.746
We good?

14:33.790 --> 14:35.958
Look, if I'm being honest, Ava,

14:36.125 --> 14:38.794
I'm just feeling insecure
about this whole thing.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.295
You look grand.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.923
Your hair's combed all nice.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.885
Buttons are straight,
and you got your pocket watch.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.263
They'll look at me if I use the wrong fork.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.932
I don't think we need to worry
about table manners up there.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.726
We just pull them
old horndogs off the women,

14:54.811 --> 14:57.980
we find their history in Harlan, and we see
which one of them could be Drew.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.565
If it comes down to it,

15:00.108 --> 15:02.234
what's a few hand jobs, give or take?

15:02.485 --> 15:04.444
Well, you already looking
for an open relationship?

15:04.571 --> 15:06.446
We're not married yet, Ava Crowder.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.491
Baby, you give
as many hand jobs as you need to tonight.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.243
That's not funny.

15:15.790 --> 15:19.126
Lord, we're going to a rich folk's sex party.
Who would have thought?

15:20.169 --> 15:22.004
How did you know Jody was an asshole?

15:22.630 --> 15:23.964
You two have history together?

15:24.090 --> 15:27.342
A bit. I was with
the people he killed not a week ago.

15:27.510 --> 15:28.677
Did you know them?

15:28.761 --> 15:31.930
Him, no.
Her, I slept with once a year or two ago.

15:32.682 --> 15:33.765
That's sweet.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.017
How is that?

15:35.768 --> 15:38.020
How you're out here getting revenge.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.148
What I'm doing
is making sure you get home safe.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.358
Jackie Nevada...

15:43.443 --> 15:46.194
Sounds like a name
out of a Steve McQueen movie.

15:46.362 --> 15:50.782
My stepdad wanted to call me Sierra,
but he named me after my mom instead.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.661
She walked out on us
before I had a memory of her.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.164
They never married,
and Reno wasn't even my dad.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.249
Your stepdad's name is Reno?

15:59.375 --> 16:02.336
- Yep
- The man's name is actually Reno Nevada?

16:02.420 --> 16:03.545
Some kind of lounge singer?

16:04.255 --> 16:06.590
Card player. Taught me some tricks.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.508
Sometimes we get in games together.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.761
Sounds like you had quite an upbringing.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.346
He did okay.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.264
Best he could without my mom.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.433
I did see pictures
of her posing nude in the backyard

16:16.559 --> 16:17.893
once Reno left on the dresser.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.186
But you never saw your own mother?

16:19.270 --> 16:21.563
Lots of people
haven't seen their moms or their dads.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.191
Yet others do
as much as they can to avoid them.

16:24.734 --> 16:25.901
You just showed your cards.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.277
I don't play cards.

16:28.196 --> 16:29.946
- You're funny.
- You're charming.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.907
Jury's out if you're sincere.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.617
You think I'm working you?

16:33.743 --> 16:34.910
I don't know.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.246
My track record as of late,
don't suppose I could tell.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.381
Boyd and Ava Crowder.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.818
With all the rumours
I've heard over the years,

17:07.944 --> 17:09.944
I expected some ancient Roman spectacle.

17:10.946 --> 17:14.449
Truth be told, I'm happy I don't have to see
most of these people naked.

17:17.994 --> 17:20.497
Wow, look at her!

17:21.457 --> 17:24.376
If this fine flower is what's
growing on the dung heaps of Harlan,

17:24.460 --> 17:26.752
maybe we ought to relax
our admission policy.

17:36.431 --> 17:37.848
What are you drinking, sir?

17:37.974 --> 17:39.766
Some of Jimmy Russell's finest.

17:39.851 --> 17:42.144
Well, Rare Breed or Reserve?

17:42.645 --> 17:43.854
You know your Wild Turkey.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.105
Well, us folks down the mountain,

17:45.189 --> 17:47.441
we got to wash
the taste of dung out of our mouth

17:47.525 --> 17:48.817
with something.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.118
Excuse us.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.620
Former Sheriff Napier.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.664
We do thank you for the invite.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.958
Well, didn't have much choice
in the matter the way Arnold put it.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.626
Well, we all have choices, Mr Napier.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.295
Ours was to come
and meet some new people.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.464
You're about
as welcome here as a case of the clap.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.007
You can worm your way in here,

18:12.133 --> 18:14.176
but that's all you're ever gonna be,
a goddamn worm.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.386
Well, too bad
you weren't the early bird that caught it.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.346
Excuse me, Tillman.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.016
I'd like a chance to greet our guests.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.559
I'm Deborah Jane, your hostess.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.020
- I'm Boyd Crowder.
- Boyd Crowder, yes,

18:25.146 --> 18:26.980
and Ava Crowder, obviously.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.315
Welcome.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.358
Listen, why don't y'all drink your drinks,

18:30.485 --> 18:33.153
and I will take this lovely on a little tour?

18:33.321 --> 18:35.864
- Happy hunting. Okay?
- Right this way.

18:36.199 --> 18:39.868
Number-one rule. My house, my rules.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.996
I don't drink red margaritas.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.543
She a professional?

18:48.878 --> 18:52.589
No, she's just had a lot of practise.

18:54.175 --> 18:57.219
See, honey, the swinging and the swapping,

18:57.553 --> 19:00.347
it's just the bittiest bit of what we do up here.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.808
I mean, you know
that we girls hold all the power, right?

19:02.892 --> 19:05.018
As it was and ever shall be.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.896
And I'm not just talking about this.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.773
I'm talking about Harlan.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.234
If weren't for us
and these little get-togethers,

19:12.318 --> 19:14.069
nothing would ever get done.

19:15.905 --> 19:16.905
But don't you worry, sugar,

19:16.989 --> 19:19.241
'cause you don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.744
Rule number one up here is, no means no.

19:37.927 --> 19:41.429
I see you didn't go for
one of Tillman's frosty-sugar shits.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.099
When it comes to the devil's water,
I'm a simple man.

19:44.767 --> 19:45.851
To good taste.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.103
Cheers.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.356
- Lee Paxton.
- Gerald Johns.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.441
- Hello, gentlemen. I'm...
- Boyd Crowder.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.776
It's a pleasure.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.821
Here I thought
I'd never be part of the "in" crowd.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.699
Why don't you come on over
and have a little talk with us?

20:00.783 --> 20:03.034
- Well, I'd love to.
- All right.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.205
I moved to Harlan in '86,

20:07.331 --> 20:10.375
scabbing for Eastover, which I ain't proud of.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.669
But man's got to eat.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.672
Funeral homes have been
in my family for five generations.

20:15.798 --> 20:18.049
But you yourself, are you new here?

20:18.134 --> 20:22.637
Oh, no, Mr Crowder.
I came back here after my aunt died in 1980.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.056
I know a family moved down into Slop Creek

20:25.141 --> 20:27.350
when John F.K. Became president.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.311
We still call them the new neighbours.

20:30.313 --> 20:31.396
What'd you do before that?

20:31.480 --> 20:34.316
I was logging in Cumberland.
It's where I grew up.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.067
I had an uncle that logged there.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.153
Garret. I remember.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.823
He used to bring you
and your mama to the company cookouts.

20:42.158 --> 20:45.410
Bopping people on the head
with your little princess wand.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.331
You still granting wishes?

20:49.498 --> 20:51.499
Only on a case-by-case basis.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.169
Excuse me.

20:58.341 --> 20:59.716
Well, how about yourself, Mr Johns?

20:59.842 --> 21:02.677
I moved here in '91,
what you might call a windfall.

21:02.845 --> 21:05.013
Well, you mean it's true what they
say about your car dealership?

21:05.181 --> 21:06.514
I got the best deals in town?

21:06.682 --> 21:09.517
- That, and you won it in a hand of poker.
- It is.

21:09.852 --> 21:12.562
- A bet's a bet.
- Now, that is true. A bet is a bet.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.689
We're glad to see you here, son.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.066
Is that so?

21:16.192 --> 21:17.484
Yeah, I'm sure you are, Lee.

21:17.568 --> 21:18.944
Frank, you drunk too much.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.321
You dragged up that lowlander

21:21.405 --> 21:24.699
that screwed Black Pike Coal
in a deal with Mags Bennett.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.076
You gonna do the same thing to me?

21:26.202 --> 21:29.496
I'm afraid the only person
I'm gonna be screwing tonight is my fiancée.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.539
And no offence to your wife.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.542
I know the game, and I still ain't playing.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.127
You can all go to hell.

21:39.548 --> 21:42.926
Well, gentlemen,
if I am to believe your inebriated friend,

21:43.260 --> 21:45.053
a game is afoot?

21:46.222 --> 21:47.806
I take it I'm a player?

21:55.731 --> 21:58.817
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:00.945 --> 22:03.279
You've been playing poker
all your life, haven't you?

22:03.406 --> 22:06.032
- Started when you were...
- Sixteen, playing online.

22:06.117 --> 22:08.159
That's close to all your life.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.161
- Want a beer?
- Better not.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.454
I'm gonna have a beer.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.124
You always play for money?

22:14.291 --> 22:15.625
What's the point if you don't, right?

22:15.751 --> 22:17.419
- Suppose at school.
- UK.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.712
I play every night.

22:18.796 --> 22:21.256
- Do you cheat?
- No.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.091
You mean you don't have to.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.427
- You read people.
- It's unavoidable.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.263
Check out mannerisms while
you're deciding on the odds.

22:28.597 --> 22:29.931
All there is to it.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.935
Maybe instead of a beer,
you'd like to play poker and have a chat?

22:34.103 --> 22:36.271
I got to do a thing.

22:53.289 --> 22:54.497
Hey, girl.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.124
Jesus Christ!

22:56.625 --> 22:58.293
Jody, you can't ring the doorbell?

22:58.669 --> 23:00.670
Bell's so loud. So loud.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.714
That why you're
creeping around like a criminal?

23:02.798 --> 23:05.258
For one, I am a criminal. It's a known fact.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.302
And two, I happen to know

23:07.803 --> 23:09.804
you all cosy with the law all of a sudden,

23:09.930 --> 23:12.932
so I got to make my entrance
idiosyncratic so they don't see me.

23:13.017 --> 23:16.978
- Then what do you want, Jody?
- I want the security code to Katrina's house.

23:17.271 --> 23:20.106
Can you cooperate with me,
or are we gonna have to find your joints,

23:20.191 --> 23:21.775
cut you apart like a chicken?

23:21.859 --> 23:23.318
This is ridiculous.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.946
Just... Jody... All right, just... Just let me go.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.364
Come on. Just let go of me.

23:28.491 --> 23:30.116
- Okay?
- Hey, hey, hey!

23:32.703 --> 23:35.497
Hey! Hey. We're done with that!

23:47.343 --> 23:48.718
Shit.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.678
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

23:51.972 --> 23:53.139
Then I press pound?

23:53.224 --> 23:58.311
No, it's pound, 7-8-4-9-5...

23:58.395 --> 24:00.688
Don't move a muscle, Jody.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.398
Ain't this some shit?

24:02.691 --> 24:04.984
Shut your mouth. Drop the knife.

24:05.861 --> 24:06.903
Well, see, now...

24:10.199 --> 24:11.366
Come on.

24:11.492 --> 24:13.034
I am gonna count to one.

24:14.328 --> 24:15.912
Jackie, no.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.248
Get down!

24:22.044 --> 24:23.336
Shit!

24:23.838 --> 24:26.214
Kennet, go, go, go, go!

24:27.883 --> 24:29.217
Shit, shit!

24:42.898 --> 24:44.149
You need a doctor.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.483
I need to see Raylan bleed

24:45.568 --> 24:47.861
like I'm bleeding all up
in this heap-of-shit car of yours,

24:47.945 --> 24:48.987
then I need my money!

24:49.071 --> 24:51.156
Hey, hey, hey, five minutes ago,
this heap of shit had a roof!

24:51.240 --> 24:53.116
Now it's caved in like a pancake!

24:53.242 --> 24:55.243
- You broke my car!
- I broke my hip!

24:55.369 --> 24:57.954
When am I gonna
get my money, Jody? Before you die?

24:58.122 --> 25:00.039
I'm not gonna die. Raylan's gonna die.

25:00.124 --> 25:01.791
This pain shit is on him!

25:02.459 --> 25:04.377
I'm gonna kill him just for the relief of it.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.880
How are you gonna do that, shape you're in?

25:07.047 --> 25:10.133
I heard him tell his
Knoxville piece of pussy where he lives.

25:10.259 --> 25:13.094
I can kill that man
easy as I eat a girl scout cookie.

25:13.596 --> 25:15.263
This is so goddamn crazy.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.599
This is drama.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.435
You can use this, make the best movie ever.

25:21.228 --> 25:24.105
You and me,
we're gonna make that movie tonight!

25:24.773 --> 25:26.441
Feel like we're chasing the hot potato.

25:26.567 --> 25:29.277
Mind if we keep her awhile,
save the state gas money?

25:29.403 --> 25:31.237
I'd prefer to keep an eye on her myself.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.488
Would you?

25:32.615 --> 25:34.657
- Anything on the vanity plates?
- Yeah, it just came in.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.660
Some shitbag named
Kenny Blanks over on Race Street.

25:37.786 --> 25:38.786
I'm going over in a second.

25:38.913 --> 25:40.455
I was gonna drop her off at a hotel.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.832
- Maybe I can tag along.
- Good for me.

25:46.295 --> 25:47.795
Come on. Let's go.

26:18.285 --> 26:26.584
Boyd?

26:28.128 --> 26:31.089
There you are, sweetheart.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.757
You disappeared on me.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.009
Well, a girl's expected to mingle.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.011
Now, I'm glad to hear you say that.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.013
Hoping we might mingle right now.

26:39.139 --> 26:42.475
Boys, you know,
I'm afraid it's past my bedtime.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.352
I need to get home
and get some beauty sleep.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.313
Come on, now.
Are you a player or some kind of gawker?

26:47.439 --> 26:48.940
And keep in mind,
there's only one right answer.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.358
Oh, yeah?

26:50.442 --> 26:52.193
Last man handled me like that,

26:52.319 --> 26:53.861
I shot dead at the dinner table.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.113
Come on. Don't you know why you're here?

26:55.197 --> 26:56.364
You might as well enjoy yourself.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.449
Son, son, come on.

27:00.536 --> 27:03.121
Now, I'm gonna keep turning till I hear a pop.

27:03.205 --> 27:05.039
You might as well enjoy yourself.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.542
Leave him be, Boyd.
He's gonna have to answer to me.

27:10.379 --> 27:13.673
Abel, you get your sorry ass
down them stairs right now.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.342
- Goddamn gawkers!
- Let's go.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.137
Where the hell did you disappear to?

27:19.221 --> 27:20.555
Look, I had you on a rope, baby.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.056
It just got a little longer than I intended.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.558
What were you doing?

27:23.642 --> 27:24.892
Waiting to see how far
they were gonna take it?

27:24.977 --> 27:27.145
I came when I saw.

27:27.730 --> 27:30.064
Now, I'm sorry if you got nervous.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.026
Okay? Come here.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.069
Come here.

27:40.868 --> 27:43.494
You find out if one of these guys was Drew?

27:43.579 --> 27:45.997
Lee maybe, Gerald maybe. I don't know.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.166
But I do know why they invited us here.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.543
I think they want me to
strong-arm Frank Browning.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.754
- The mine owner?
- The same.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.089
Now, they want me
to run you home, come back up here,

27:55.257 --> 27:56.341
and hear what they got to say.

27:56.425 --> 27:57.842
I don't trust these Clover Hill people.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.011
That don't mean
I can't make a little money off of them

28:00.095 --> 28:02.388
while I find out
if one of them is Drew Thompson.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.433
Now, where's your rabbit-fur jacket?
Let's go.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.605
Oh, God damn it, Jody.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.608
Dragging me into your bullshit.

28:14.735 --> 28:18.446
Oh, I'm such an idiot.
I am so stupid, stupid, stupid!

28:19.740 --> 28:22.742
All right, if the cops come, they come.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.286
If Jody kills the guy, problem solved.

28:26.622 --> 28:27.955
Oh, my God.

28:28.457 --> 28:29.916
What am I gonna do?

28:31.418 --> 28:32.877
Just kill myself.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.712
I'll get laid, and then I'll kill myself.

28:36.465 --> 28:37.965
Okay, okay, okay.

28:41.387 --> 28:42.470
Kenneth?

28:42.971 --> 28:44.555
- Yeah, baby!
- You all right?

28:44.640 --> 28:46.307
I'll be out in a sec, all right?

28:49.561 --> 28:51.062
My first crime scene.

28:51.772 --> 28:53.564
Enjoy it from right here.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.406
I'm almost done with the script.
It's a lot of laughs.

29:03.826 --> 29:05.576
Why does every cop knock like that?

29:09.456 --> 29:11.749
Hands up. Get against the wall.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.167
Kenny?

29:13.252 --> 29:14.502
How long you been a Kenny?

29:14.586 --> 29:16.838
Well, since it's sort of my name,
my whole life.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.674
I have friends who only call me Kenneth.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.342
Jody, you know what he calls me?

29:21.468 --> 29:23.594
"Kennet" without the diphthong.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.763
I bet you're wondering if he's here. He isn't.

29:25.848 --> 29:28.683
I haven't seen him since, an hour ago?

29:29.017 --> 29:31.144
This doesn't sound like any of my business.

29:31.687 --> 29:32.812
So...

29:34.857 --> 29:37.108
Jody left you a movie he's starring in.

29:37.192 --> 29:38.943
If you're Raylan.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.111
He wants me to see it?

29:40.195 --> 29:42.196
Don't worry. It isn't too long.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.365
- Who shot it?
- I did.

29:44.491 --> 29:45.867
I worked with him before.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.952
Most of the ones
where he's by himself are rather boring,

29:48.036 --> 29:49.662
but his X-rated stuff,

29:49.872 --> 29:51.956
I think, is better than most.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.833
- Jody does porn?
- Some.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.501
But this one...

29:56.044 --> 29:58.045
This one you have to watch
while you're here.

30:05.679 --> 30:06.804
That's how I see the world.

30:07.347 --> 30:08.931
Going around like this basketball.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.351
Me and you gonna have to
meet up again, Raylan.

30:12.436 --> 30:13.936
Can't say when right now.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.106
You're gonna be looking over your
shoulder till I make the scene.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.859
Then we gonna take it to the edge.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.203
You think he'll pick a spot
and be lying in wait?

30:30.996 --> 30:32.914
Might walk up behind me
in a street full of people

30:32.998 --> 30:34.582
and press his gun to my back.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.293
I think you'd like Jody to find you.

30:38.045 --> 30:39.795
Might be the only way to get her done.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.841
Having to look at all
the faces in the crowd wears you out.

30:44.635 --> 30:47.553
I think if I were a guy, I'd be a lot like you.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.430
Become a US Marshal.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.848
You're serious?

30:51.183 --> 30:52.475
I may be.

30:53.602 --> 30:56.270
I might as well tell you now
'cause I know I will later.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.064
I got a serious crush on you.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.402
Before my heart starts racing
and we bang into someone's rear end,

31:03.487 --> 31:04.529
I want to make a stop.

31:04.613 --> 31:07.448
- Where?
- High Note Bar. For a minute.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.699
Stick my head in.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.701
You think Jody might be there.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.162
How'd you guess?

31:13.413 --> 31:14.914
Got a look on your face.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.959
I'm right half the time I get the feeling.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.878
Wait here in the car, okay?

31:21.004 --> 31:22.547
I won't be five minutes.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.616
This isn't a drill, is it?

31:51.660 --> 31:52.785
No.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.871
All right, everybody, let's go. Out!

31:56.832 --> 31:57.957
Move!

32:05.966 --> 32:07.425
I saw your movie.

32:08.051 --> 32:11.095
I know what your intentions are.
I could pull right now and shoot you.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.765
You want to do it right here?

32:14.975 --> 32:16.350
Don't bother me none.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.062
Like I told you, we gonna take it to the edge.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.736
Remember how it was the first time?

32:26.820 --> 32:28.487
You didn't think I was gonna shoot you?

32:29.364 --> 32:30.615
And you didn't.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.283
How about now?

32:41.126 --> 32:43.836
I run into this kind of situation on the job.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.588
You've made up your mind to give up,

32:45.672 --> 32:48.674
and you're still alive but for how long?

32:52.346 --> 32:53.512
You ain't gonna shoot.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.260
Oh, there he is,

33:33.637 --> 33:36.472
looking like 10 pounds of shit
in a five-pound bag.

33:37.766 --> 33:41.560
- How about a beer?
- How about a salute to the Iraqi war hero?

33:42.646 --> 33:44.939
You know, I never did thank you for your

33:45.023 --> 33:46.816
generous service to our great nation.

33:46.900 --> 33:50.194
On second thought, how about you
blow me and then get me a beer?

33:50.946 --> 33:52.780
Come on, man. I'm just having a little fun.

33:52.864 --> 33:53.989
I know you can handle it.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.494
Or maybe you can't. Maybe that's why
you've been a little sparse as of late.

33:58.829 --> 33:59.912
What is that supposed to mean?

33:59.996 --> 34:02.415
Haven't seen you around much?
You sure you ain't laying low?

34:06.461 --> 34:07.545
I've been sick.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.297
Been in bed.

34:13.635 --> 34:17.513
You ever get those fever dreams?

34:18.806 --> 34:20.181
I hate 'em.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.810
Make me feel like I'm going insane.

34:24.603 --> 34:27.273
I get 'em. Everyone gets 'em.

34:27.357 --> 34:28.524
You kill a lot of people?

34:30.610 --> 34:32.902
- What?
- In Iraq.

34:33.321 --> 34:35.531
Is it any different than killing folk over here?

34:35.614 --> 34:36.866
Now, what do you mean by that, Johnny?

34:36.992 --> 34:38.659
Is it different than killing white folk?

34:38.994 --> 34:40.119
No.

34:40.454 --> 34:41.620
Innocents.

34:42.038 --> 34:43.121
You know...

34:43.998 --> 34:46.500
Civilians, kids, that sort of thing.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.210
You see their faces in your dreams?

34:48.670 --> 34:50.670
I hear a lot of veterans have that problem.

34:50.922 --> 34:54.175
You need to check your fridge, Johnny.
This beer's warm as piss.

34:56.386 --> 34:58.012
You see Ellen May's face?

35:03.852 --> 35:05.352
No, I haven't.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.023
No, you wouldn't since

35:10.567 --> 35:12.610
she wasn't exactly innocent.

35:16.948 --> 35:21.243
Boyd, do you know
about the EPA Superfund?

35:21.536 --> 35:26.874
They come in after
there's a big environmental disaster like, say,

35:26.958 --> 35:29.668
a slurry pond breaks its banks.

35:29.753 --> 35:33.297
Pour in a king's ransom
of government funds for the cleanup.

35:33.590 --> 35:34.882
Well, let me guess.

35:35.884 --> 35:38.427
You want Frank Browning
to bust open one of his ponds

35:38.553 --> 35:42.181
so all of you can suck off the federal tit,

35:42.265 --> 35:44.058
but he ain't willing to play along.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.976
Told you he was sharp.

35:47.729 --> 35:50.648
Frank Browning is indeed a problem.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.817
You seem like a problem solver.

35:53.401 --> 35:54.902
You want me to twist his arm?

35:55.487 --> 35:56.570
We'd prefer it

35:57.322 --> 35:58.948
if you kill him.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.458
And if I say no?

36:09.584 --> 36:11.585
After all we've given you?

36:12.754 --> 36:13.921
Come again?

36:15.465 --> 36:16.632
How about the whorehouse?

36:18.426 --> 36:19.510
Drug running.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.679
You ever think how you have that?

36:23.765 --> 36:24.932
'Cause we let you.

36:25.100 --> 36:28.435
Keeps your cross-eyed
brethren down the mountain placated.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.271
You know what that word means,
"placated"?

36:30.605 --> 36:32.022
Yes, I do.

36:33.775 --> 36:36.277
But I think the word
you're looking for is "pacified."

36:37.529 --> 36:39.446
I think you're missing the point.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.740
Your daddy got the point.

36:42.951 --> 36:45.327
Crowders do what we say.

36:45.620 --> 36:49.290
And to be crystal goddamn

36:50.250 --> 36:51.584
clear,

36:52.627 --> 36:55.754
kill Frank Browning, or we'll destroy you.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.807
Wow. I was not expecting this.

37:07.601 --> 37:10.185
When the Marshals do things,
we try to do it right.

37:11.313 --> 37:12.479
I like how you do things.

37:12.606 --> 37:15.316
I know I give you a charge,
but you seem almost giddy.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.693
That got anything to do
with what's in the bag?

37:17.819 --> 37:18.861
My school books?

37:18.987 --> 37:20.112
Jackie.

37:20.989 --> 37:23.282
I figured out why Jody
came back to Lexington

37:23.366 --> 37:24.950
instead of just taking off.

37:25.035 --> 37:27.161
Wasn't 'cause of the kids or Katrina.

37:27.829 --> 37:31.457
It was for the money,
and I'm pretty sure it is in that bag.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.044
What are you gonna do about it?

37:35.170 --> 37:38.047
It's ill-gotten gains.
If I find it, I got to turn it in.

37:38.840 --> 37:39.965
But...

37:40.050 --> 37:41.675
If it was never found

37:41.801 --> 37:44.136
and it made its way back
to Katrina and the kids,

37:45.013 --> 37:47.014
that wouldn't be such a bad thing.

37:54.481 --> 37:55.814
What's up, chief?

37:55.899 --> 37:59.860
So, were you gonna tell me what
happened or just keep it to yourself?

38:00.070 --> 38:01.528
I didn't want to wake you.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.072
That's very thoughtful.

38:03.657 --> 38:06.325
Let me guess. In all this,
you still haven't made it to Tramble.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.327
First thing tomorrow morning.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.162
- Where are you?
- Don't worry.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.664
We ain't paying for the room.

38:12.082 --> 38:13.832
What, is she sitting right beside you?

38:14.542 --> 38:15.668
I hear the shower running.

38:15.752 --> 38:17.252
Probably just gonna sleep on the couch.

38:17.379 --> 38:19.213
That'd be a first for you, wouldn't it?

38:20.215 --> 38:21.674
She in love with you yet?

38:22.092 --> 38:26.637
Art, this girl ain't the least bit
interested in an old fart like me.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.555
He said humbly.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.015
Tell me we're done.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.517
We're done. For now.

38:31.768 --> 38:32.851
Go see your fath...

38:58.003 --> 38:59.378
The hell is that?

38:59.587 --> 39:02.172
FBI folder stuffed full of take-out menus.

39:03.049 --> 39:05.426
I was gonna tell you
your time was running out.

39:05.552 --> 39:08.345
They gave us everything we needed
to short-circuit your deal.

39:08.430 --> 39:10.514
But you cannot tell a lie.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.599
Didn't I teach you anything?

39:12.892 --> 39:14.268
Not really.

39:15.603 --> 39:18.522
Look, I know you think
you're the toughest man

39:18.606 --> 39:21.608
that God ever strung a gut through,
and you got your plan.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.944
Long as you stick to it,
everything's gonna work out,

39:24.029 --> 39:26.613
but just 'cause you got a plan
don't mean it's a good one.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.699
Killed a guy last night didn't understand that.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.451
Am I supposed to be impressed?

39:30.535 --> 39:31.952
It's just a fact.

39:32.454 --> 39:37.041
My plan, Arlo, was to see that
under no circumstances you got a deal.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.626
Well, I'm gonna change that.
I'm gonna cut you a deal right now.

39:39.753 --> 39:41.128
You must be hard up, boy.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.922
Suffice to say,
there's something in it for both of us.

39:44.257 --> 39:45.549
Go on.

39:47.302 --> 39:50.804
We know Drew's alive and in Harlan,
but it's gonna be a bitch to find him.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.057
- We could use your help.
- Now we're getting to it.

39:53.141 --> 39:56.060
What you don't realise is,
you could use our help.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.812
Theo Tonin knows Drew's alive, too,

39:58.938 --> 40:01.648
and guess who he's got
on his payroll helping him look for him?

40:01.900 --> 40:04.068
- Boyd Crowder.
- You're bullshitting me.

40:04.152 --> 40:06.153
Son you never had is working against you.

40:06.279 --> 40:08.238
So, maybe I did teach you
something after all.

40:08.323 --> 40:11.075
If they find him first, your deal evaporates,

40:11.159 --> 40:14.244
but you tell me right now and we get to him,

40:14.829 --> 40:18.916
I will make sure you
live out your days in a country-club jail.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.250
Let me consider it.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.503
For once in our lives, let's work together?

40:22.587 --> 40:24.129
I've considered it.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.548
Eat shit.

40:33.348 --> 40:34.681
So be it.

40:36.101 --> 40:37.976
I'm gonna go see Sheriff Hunter now.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.645
Josiah says he knows Drew.

40:39.729 --> 40:42.689
Maybe he'll take that
country-club deal instead of you?

40:44.234 --> 40:47.361
See what you did there? I struck a nerve.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.238
- Didn't do anything.
- Exactly.

40:49.364 --> 40:53.450
As long as I can remember, whenever you got
bad news, you had a face like a statue.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.077
Can't help I'm good-looking.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.870
So long, Arlo.

40:57.872 --> 41:02.126
You're gonna die here
and not in the distant future.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.129
Tomorrow or maybe Sunday after chow.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.380
You threatening me?

41:06.464 --> 41:07.673
And I'll tell you something.

41:07.924 --> 41:10.473
I'm gonna be glad when I hear the news.
