Well, I did it.
I did what I had to do.

16:53.682 --> 16:57.259
That's what it takes to pull off
Christmas with no money.

16:57.737 --> 16:59.017
And it's not pretty.

17:01.940 --> 17:03.566
I had to drop three classes.

17:12.140 --> 17:13.906
You had to drop three classes?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.473
- You were only taking four!
- Hey, look.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.107
I think we should all
keep this in perspective.

17:18.181 --> 17:19.961
You know, weigh it
up against some crimes

17:20.050 --> 17:22.044
other people in this family
might have done.

17:22.271 --> 17:24.357
Oh, no. We're not talking
about me anymore.

17:24.444 --> 17:27.671
We're talking about you.
How could this happen?

17:27.741 --> 17:29.123
I had to drop them.

17:29.194 --> 17:30.517
My professors
were gonna fail me.

17:30.662 --> 17:32.783
I mean, I'm crushing
my Music-Appreciation class.

17:32.909 --> 17:33.976
Getting a C.

17:34.070 --> 17:35.708
And I'm only showing up
half the time.

17:41.163 --> 17:42.331
Well...

17:42.422 --> 17:43.904
it's your life.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.388
Announcer: <i>And they</i>
<i>are gonna call holding...</i>

17:50.542 --> 17:52.229
Oh, God.

17:52.466 --> 17:55.981
I really shouldn't have eaten
those mashed potatoes.

17:56.061 --> 17:58.294
You sure it wasn't
that pan of pus you sucked down?

17:58.411 --> 18:01.185
What's your problem?
Your plan worked.

18:01.259 --> 18:04.342
You got away with it.
Dad barely reacted.

18:04.433 --> 18:07.888
No. No way.
Something bad's coming.

18:07.968 --> 18:08.817
Dad's way too calm.

18:08.899 --> 18:10.577
It's weird.
He's got to be furious with me.

18:11.342 --> 18:12.776
You guys want to play
some football?

18:12.864 --> 18:15.997
Uh... sure.

18:18.345 --> 18:19.694
Axl, you're my receiver.

18:19.753 --> 18:21.787
Brick, you keep laying there

18:21.877 --> 18:23.299
and finish what you started.

18:23.396 --> 18:24.807
[ Strained ] Okay.

18:24.879 --> 18:26.374
Okay. Great.

18:26.447 --> 18:29.566
So, it's family versus family.

18:29.719 --> 18:31.582
All right, Goodwins,
let's do this.

18:31.755 --> 18:33.903
- Dads cover the dads.
Axl: - Ready?

18:33.992 --> 18:35.372
[ Chuckles ]
Go on. Go on.

18:35.464 --> 18:37.924
Okay. Here we go.
47. 22.

18:38.008 --> 18:39.393
Hut! Hut! Hike!

18:40.223 --> 18:41.254
Nice snap, Sue.

18:42.772 --> 18:43.996
Oh!

18:44.077 --> 18:45.079
That's okay.

18:45.539 --> 18:46.946
[ Grunts ]

18:47.030 --> 18:48.748
Wow, that girl can hit.

18:48.847 --> 18:50.273
I don't even have the ball.

18:50.559 --> 18:51.816
And you're on my team!

18:51.928 --> 18:53.253
Oh, sorry.

18:56.366 --> 18:57.369
You know, Frankie.

18:57.513 --> 18:59.586
You causing that mall stampede

18:59.670 --> 19:01.356
made me pissing away
the cruise money

19:01.437 --> 19:03.254
look not so bad.
[ Chuckles ]

19:03.328 --> 19:04.948
Okay,
I think the term "Stampede"

19:05.088 --> 19:06.533
is a little inaccurate.

19:06.621 --> 19:09.858
I would call it a...
group hurry.

19:09.987 --> 19:10.886
Axl: Ready? Break.

19:10.959 --> 19:14.531
The point is
everyone makes mistakes.

19:15.361 --> 19:16.929
I think now is a good time
to tell you

19:17.007 --> 19:19.442
that I joined Weight Watchers
in 1996,

19:19.540 --> 19:22.814
and I forgot to cancel
my monthly membership.

19:23.305 --> 19:24.221
Hmm.

19:25.288 --> 19:26.706
Mike: Down, set.

19:26.990 --> 19:27.892
Hut! Hike!

19:31.515 --> 19:34.760
Mm. That's okay, Axl.
You tried.

19:34.986 --> 19:36.651
What? No, it's not.

19:36.855 --> 19:38.733
It's not all right.
What's the matter with you?

19:38.813 --> 19:40.019
Why aren't you yelling at me?

19:40.761 --> 19:41.878
Why would I yell at you?

19:41.958 --> 19:44.121
Uh, 'cause I had to drop
three classes.

19:44.243 --> 19:45.444
It's your life, Axl.

19:45.514 --> 19:47.336
[ Groans ]
Stop saying that.

19:47.636 --> 19:48.862
What do you want me to say?

19:49.081 --> 19:50.357
That you should stop
goofing around in college

19:50.450 --> 19:51.865
and start taking it
more seriously?

19:51.964 --> 19:53.252
Yeah.

19:53.330 --> 19:54.286
That you should
spend more time studying

19:54.382 --> 19:55.451
and less time partying?

19:55.568 --> 19:56.362
Duh.

19:56.448 --> 19:58.138
That you should realize
the decisions you make now

19:58.213 --> 19:59.633
are gonna determine
the rest of your life,

19:59.744 --> 20:01.066
so you better
think them through?

20:01.196 --> 20:03.248
Uh, yeah.
I think so, yeah.

20:03.384 --> 20:06.195
I'm not gonna say that.
You're not ours anymore.

20:06.352 --> 20:09.090
It's your life now.
It's up to you how it all goes.

20:09.245 --> 20:11.223
Well,
thanks for the heads-up.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.704
That would have been great
to know before I screwed it up.

20:13.778 --> 20:15.162
When were you planning on
telling me?

20:15.235 --> 20:17.592
Hey, you want to be an adult?
Be an adult.

20:17.677 --> 20:18.790
Fine.

20:18.912 --> 20:21.213
I'll meet with my adviser
as soon as I get back to school

20:21.300 --> 20:22.724
and figure out
how I can make up these credits.

20:22.794 --> 20:24.197
Is that what you want?

20:24.499 --> 20:25.978
It doesn't matter what <i>I</i> want.

20:26.124 --> 20:27.324
It's what <i>you</i> want.

20:27.406 --> 20:29.165
[ Groans ]
What game are you playing?

20:29.331 --> 20:31.116
There's no game, Axl.

20:31.237 --> 20:33.873
Uh, is this part of the game,
you saying there's no game?

20:34.462 --> 20:36.848
Come on in.
Pie's ready.

20:45.967 --> 20:48.715
Okay, next semester,
I am loading up on credits,

20:48.814 --> 20:50.290
and I'm not doing anything fun.

20:50.391 --> 20:52.354
Fun's over.
No joining a frat.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.144
No Thirsty Thursdays.
No nothing.

20:54.256 --> 20:55.761
And I'm coming home
every weekend to study.

20:55.899 --> 20:57.688
And I'm not giving myself
any pie.

20:57.782 --> 20:59.016
I don't deserve pie.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.057
Okay, well,
maybe one small piece,

21:01.141 --> 21:02.725
but I will not use
whipped cream.

21:07.398 --> 21:08.541
Frankie:
<i>Yeah, in our house,</i>

21:08.646 --> 21:10.533
<i>Thanksgiving means</i>
<i>being thankful</i>

21:10.658 --> 21:12.688
<i>that no matter</i>
<i>what stupid thing you did,</i>

21:12.813 --> 21:13.761
<i>it's a pretty safe bet</i>

21:13.850 --> 21:15.880
<i>that someone did</i>
<i>something stupider than you.</i>

21:16.263 --> 21:18.316
Again, I am so sorry
about everything.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.350
I know it was
a pretty screwy Thanksgiving.

21:20.442 --> 21:21.408
[ Chuckles ]

21:21.664 --> 21:23.403
So, I guess I'll see you
at Christmas, huh?

21:23.572 --> 21:25.836
- Okay, I'll be here.
- Oh, yeah. I know you will.

21:25.959 --> 21:27.914
[ Chuckles ]
See you on the 25th.

21:27.991 --> 21:29.313
