I FAILED HIM.

48:15.667 --> 48:18.125
HE DESERVES BETTER...

48:18.125 --> 48:21.000
AND HE'LL GET IT FROM NOW ON.

48:43.417 --> 48:45.667
I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

48:45.667 --> 48:49.083
JEREMY DID HEAR MY ADVICE.

48:49.083 --> 48:52.375
HE KILLED SOMEONE
WHO DESERVES TO DIE.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.375
WHAT'S THE STATUS
ON PERRY?

48:58.375 --> 49:00.083
I'M HAVING HIM TRANSFERRED
RIGHT NOW.

49:00.083 --> 49:02.208
THE D.A. WANTS TO KEEP HIM
AT COUNTY,

49:02.208 --> 49:05.166
PENDING ARRAIGNMENT.

49:05.166 --> 49:08.166
MARIA, IT WAS
YOUR DECISION MAKING

49:08.166 --> 49:11.333
THAT LED TO HIS CAPTURE
AND ARREST,

49:11.333 --> 49:13.750
AND YOU MADE
ALL OUR LIVES EASIER

49:13.750 --> 49:15.583
BY GETTING THE BASTARD
TO CONFESS.

49:15.583 --> 49:17.792
I'M JUST DOING MY JOB.

49:17.792 --> 49:20.792
IT FEELS GOOD TO BE
PRAISING YOUR POLICE WORK

49:20.792 --> 49:24.583
INSTEAD OF YOUR POLITICS
FOR A CHANGE.

49:24.583 --> 49:26.792
WE NEED TO MAKE
AN OFFICIAL COMMENT.

49:26.792 --> 49:29.667
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL KEEP IT SHORT.

49:29.667 --> 49:31.792
I'M JUST HEADING DOWNSTAIRS NOW
FOR THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

49:31.792 --> 49:33.709
THE PRESS CONFERENCE
IS OVER.

49:33.709 --> 49:36.417
OH, AND, UH, DON'T WORRY.

49:36.417 --> 49:38.583
I KEPT IT SHORT.

49:38.583 --> 49:40.875
YOU GOT TO BE FUCKING
KIDDING ME.

49:40.875 --> 49:42.542
THAT WAS MY BUST.

49:42.542 --> 49:44.125
THIS IS MY DEPARTMENT.

49:46.792 --> 49:50.458
DID YOU AT LEAST
GIVE ME CREDIT?

49:50.458 --> 49:52.625
YES.
I JUST GAVE IT TO YOU.

49:52.625 --> 49:54.333
HAVEN'T YOU BEEN LISTENING?

50:00.792 --> 50:04.542
EVER SINCE HARRY'S DEATH,
I'VE BEEN ALONE...

50:08.083 --> 50:12.208
...BUT NOW,
FOR THE FIRST TIME...

50:12.208 --> 50:14.667
I FEEL ALONE.

50:14.667 --> 50:17.041
HOW LONG YOU NEED
WITH THE PRISONER?

50:21.291 --> 50:23.583
AS LONG AS I CAN GET.

50:23.583 --> 50:25.083
JEREMY IS GONE,

50:25.083 --> 50:27.166
AND NEIL PERRY
WILL SOON VANISH

50:27.166 --> 50:30.041
INTO THE CATACOMBS
OF THE SYSTEM.

50:30.041 --> 50:33.375
I HAVE SO MANY
QUESTIONS FOR HIM.

50:33.375 --> 50:35.834
HOW DID HE DISCOVER
MY SECRETS?

50:35.834 --> 50:38.542
WHAT WAS HIS MESSAGE TO ME?

50:40.083 --> 50:43.083
HE'S BEEN IN MY HOME,

50:43.083 --> 50:47.959
MY PHOTOS...MY LIFE.

50:47.959 --> 50:50.625
HE KNOWS ME.

50:50.625 --> 50:53.166
NOW I NEED TO KNOW HIM...

50:59.500 --> 51:02.917
...TO CONNECT FACE-TO-FACE

51:02.917 --> 51:06.166
BEFORE HE'S BEYOND
MY REACH FOREVER.

51:18.417 --> 51:20.166
HI.

51:22.709 --> 51:25.834
WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?

51:44.709 --> 51:47.709
