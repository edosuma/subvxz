WEBVTT

00:01.294 --> 00:02.295
<i>We might be owned.</i>

00:02.379 --> 00:03.380
<i>Dark Army.</i>

00:03.463 --> 00:05.632
<i>The world's most
dangerous hacker crew.</i>

00:05.715 --> 00:08.426
<i>They think the FBI's
even snooping,
and it gets ugly.</i>

00:08.510 --> 00:10.387
<i>They keep
asking me questions.</i>

00:10.470 --> 00:11.721
I'm gonna keep
telling your story.

00:11.805 --> 00:13.431
But if shit goes down
and I get busted,

00:13.515 --> 00:14.724
I'm not gonna
get locked up.

00:14.808 --> 00:18.269
<i>My husband will return soon,
and this will all be over.</i>

00:18.353 --> 00:21.481
<i>He wants to hack
Steel Mountain's climate
control system.</i>

00:22.899 --> 00:24.025
Take care of yourself.

00:25.026 --> 00:27.195
There will be fallout from
this and I'm gonna tell them.

00:27.278 --> 00:28.530
<i>I used your computer.</i>

00:28.613 --> 00:30.073
<i>So tell them
whatever you want.</i>

00:30.156 --> 00:32.200
The server keeps crashing,
and I don't know
how to stop it.

00:32.283 --> 00:33.368
We need to find
someone who can do

00:33.451 --> 00:35.078
that migration thing
he keep talking about.

00:35.161 --> 00:37.247
<i>You hack people,
I hack time.</i>

00:41.251 --> 00:42.919
<i>Someone's closing in on us.</i>

00:43.002 --> 00:44.421
<i>I have to find
out what they know.</i>

00:44.504 --> 00:46.423
My online business
is very important to me.

00:46.506 --> 00:47.841
I prefer discretion.

00:48.258 --> 00:49.759
What exactly are you doing?

00:49.843 --> 00:51.720
I'm hacking the FBI.

01:11.489 --> 01:14.743
<i>Step 1: Identify
the target and its flaws.</i>

01:14.826 --> 01:17.829
<i>There are always flaws.
I learned that early in life.</i>

01:17.912 --> 01:20.039
<i>My first hack,
the local library,</i>

01:20.248 --> 01:23.626
<i>a vulnerable FTP server
and its AS/400.</i>

01:23.710 --> 01:26.129
<i>A far cry
from the Android
zero-days I'm using</i>

01:26.212 --> 01:29.174
<i>to own the FBI
standard-issue smartphone.</i>

01:29.257 --> 01:33.261
<i>The library was a test to see
if I could even
get into the system.</i>

01:33.344 --> 01:35.096
<i>I've since set greater goals.</i>

01:35.180 --> 01:36.848
<i>For instance, Step 2:</i>

01:36.931 --> 01:39.434
<i>Build malware and
prepare an attack.</i>

01:39.517 --> 01:42.145
<i>At my fingertips,
the zero-day
is wrapped in code</i>

01:42.228 --> 01:45.315
<i>like a Christmas present,
then becomes an exploit,</i>

01:45.690 --> 01:48.359
<i>the programmatic expression
of my will.</i>

01:49.360 --> 01:51.154
<i>I live for this shit.</i>

01:54.407 --> 01:59.162
<i>Step 3: A reverse shell,
two-stage exploit.
The ideal package.</i>

01:59.245 --> 02:02.081
<i>Load the malware
into a femtocell
delivery system,</i>

02:02.415 --> 02:06.044
<i>my personal cell tower
that'll intercept
all mobile data.</i>

02:06.127 --> 02:07.337
<i>Similar to my first time,</i>

02:07.420 --> 02:10.089
<i>when I found myself
staring at late book fees,</i>

02:10.215 --> 02:12.801
<i>employee names,
member addresses.</i>

02:17.263 --> 02:19.599
<i>Everything was revealed.</i>

02:19.933 --> 02:23.311
<i>The secret of
the perfect hack?
Make it infallible.</i>

02:23.394 --> 02:25.772
<i>Hidden within
the kernel is a logic bomb,</i>

02:25.855 --> 02:27.816
<i>malicious code
designed to execute</i>

02:27.941 --> 02:29.901
<i>under circumstances
I've programmed.</i>

02:29.984 --> 02:32.737
<i>Should the FBI take an image
of the femtocell,</i>

02:32.821 --> 02:35.949
<i>all memory will
self-corrupt or explode.</i>

02:36.032 --> 02:38.117
<i>Step 4: Write the script.</i>

02:38.201 --> 02:39.536
<i>Why do it myself?</i>

02:39.619 --> 02:40.703
<i>Because that's how I learned,</i>

02:40.787 --> 02:44.249
<i>and I know exactly what, when
and how it's going to run.</i>

02:44.374 --> 02:48.044
<i>I didn't do anything
harmful my first time.
Just looked around.</i>

02:48.127 --> 02:49.796
<i>But I felt so powerful.</i>

02:49.879 --> 02:52.173
<i>Eleven years old
and in complete control</i>

02:52.298 --> 02:54.634
<i>of the Washington
Township Public Library.</i>

02:54.717 --> 02:57.720
<i>Today is different.
I hacked the world.</i>

02:57.804 --> 03:00.640
<i>Final step:
Launch the attack.</i>

03:00.723 --> 03:02.976
<i>Once I do,
I'll own the Android phone</i>

03:03.059 --> 03:05.353
<i>of every FBI agent
in that building.</i>

03:05.436 --> 03:09.023
<i>I'll own Evil Corp's network,
applications, everything.</i>

03:09.107 --> 03:10.233
<i>Domain Admin.</i>

03:10.316 --> 03:14.737
<i>This. The thrill
of pwning a system,
this is the greatest rush.</i>

03:14.821 --> 03:15.989
<i>God access.</i>

03:16.072 --> 03:17.782
<i>The feeling never gets old.</i>

03:32.338 --> 03:34.716
I'm gonna need to
talk to the old sys admin.

03:40.013 --> 03:43.141
The old IT guy, set this up.

03:44.350 --> 03:48.813
There's an encrypted database
on the old server
I'm gonna need access to.

03:49.689 --> 03:51.524
You want to talk to RT?

03:52.317 --> 03:54.611
If that's his name.

03:54.694 --> 03:56.404
I'll talk to Ray.

03:56.696 --> 03:58.114
See what's what.

05:04.722 --> 05:08.518
In fact, with all
the lawsuits we're facing,
the company is rebranding.

05:08.601 --> 05:10.728
Our new name, Steel Valley.

05:10.812 --> 05:12.105
What do you think?

05:12.188 --> 05:13.815
Honestly,
it's pretty terrible.

05:14.899 --> 05:17.568
I felt that,
but I didn't
want to say.

05:43.344 --> 05:46.180
Jeez Louise, look at that.

06:05.033 --> 06:06.868
What the hell
are you doing here?

06:06.951 --> 06:08.119
How did you get in?

06:08.202 --> 06:10.038
Penetration test.
You failed.

06:10.705 --> 06:11.956
Done anyway.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.209
What is this?

06:15.418 --> 06:16.961
I haven't seen you
in five weeks

06:17.086 --> 06:18.421
and now you're
just in my home?

06:21.674 --> 06:23.801
Leave now.

06:23.885 --> 06:25.136
Okay.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.305
If you want
the FBI to find out
that you were the one

06:27.388 --> 06:29.974
who illegally put a CD
into a drive at Allsafe

06:30.058 --> 06:31.851
that set off
the crime of the millennium,

06:31.934 --> 06:33.352
be my guest.

06:35.563 --> 06:36.814
He told you?

06:36.898 --> 06:40.485
Yeah.
And he cleared Allsafe's logs
to cover your ass.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.653
But now with the FBI's
Five/Nine investigation,

06:42.737 --> 06:46.115
this could all lead back
to both you and Elliot.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.826
Why didn't he say anything?

06:48.910 --> 06:53.331
Because that's what he does,
and now it's time
for you to help him.

06:58.419 --> 07:01.130
What exactly
do you want from me?

07:16.479 --> 07:18.439
Before I tell you,

07:18.523 --> 07:20.024
I need you to keep
reminding yourself

07:20.108 --> 07:22.026
that this is simple.

07:22.110 --> 07:23.903
Your gut instinct
is gonna be screaming

07:23.986 --> 07:25.571
a big fucking no,

07:25.655 --> 07:28.407
and I need you to
suppress that instinct

07:28.533 --> 07:31.244
and remind yourself
that this is simple.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.330
If this little
preface was supposed to

07:34.413 --> 07:36.040
inspire confidence,
you're failing miserably.

07:36.124 --> 07:38.751
I'll give you a small device,
which you'll take to work,

07:38.835 --> 07:43.047
drop at the Fed's
office on the 23rd floor,
and walk away.

07:43.131 --> 07:44.924
Simple.

07:47.593 --> 07:51.389
Here it comes,
that gut instinct
I was talking about.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.349
Are you out of your mind?

07:56.144 --> 07:58.771
You want me
to hack the FBI?

07:58.855 --> 08:01.482
What possible good
would that even do?

08:01.858 --> 08:04.068
Once we have
access to their system,

08:04.152 --> 08:06.320
we can make
all of the bullshit go away.

08:06.612 --> 08:08.865
Any evidence they have
on you and Elliot,

08:09.282 --> 08:10.366
gone.

08:11.576 --> 08:13.244
I'll take my chances.

08:21.627 --> 08:24.589
Fine, play it how
you want to play it,

08:24.672 --> 08:26.924
but I hope for
Elliot and your sake,

08:27.049 --> 08:29.302
no one else
knows about that CD.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.987
This is not our usual time
nor place to meet.

08:48.821 --> 08:51.324
It was very risky
for me to come here.

08:53.242 --> 08:55.536
Talk to me.
What's happened?

08:57.830 --> 08:59.123
I don't want to
do this anymore.

09:00.791 --> 09:03.711
I lied to the FBI,
and they know it.

09:04.128 --> 09:06.631
They're not stupid.
They saw me sweat.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.132
And my phone is tapped.

09:08.216 --> 09:13.304
Anytime I make phone calls,
I hear interference, voices.

09:20.645 --> 09:23.731
I mean, who are we protecting?
Some scrawny kid in a hoodie?

09:27.109 --> 09:30.905
Part of our agreement
was that you would not
ask any questions.

09:31.906 --> 09:35.201
You're right.
You're right. I just...

09:36.244 --> 09:39.372
I know someone
is watching me,
and I can tell.

09:39.455 --> 09:42.833
On the train,
at work, in my apartment.

09:42.917 --> 09:44.085
How do you know?

09:45.086 --> 09:48.589
I just do.
I feel it, you know?

09:59.058 --> 10:02.103
Thank you for
sharing this with me.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.398
I promise you
everything will be okay.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.041
Hello, sir.
You can't be here.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.085
I work here.
Not on this floor.

10:26.335 --> 10:27.920
Can you
help this guy out?

10:28.004 --> 10:30.923
We really need to
close off this elevator
to non-bureau.

10:38.222 --> 10:40.975
<i>Firefighters are already
battling fierce blazes...</i>

10:48.899 --> 10:50.526
I hate coming here.
Security's so lax.

10:50.818 --> 10:53.154
I'm still in the middle
of this deep dive
on the hard drive reports

10:53.237 --> 10:55.323
that came back
from Forensics.

11:00.328 --> 11:01.620
I had that dream again.

11:01.871 --> 11:05.624
Except this time,
I was walking
down a steep hill,

11:05.708 --> 11:08.336
and at the bottom
was that same man
wearing a surgical mask.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.881
He never tries to kill you?

11:11.964 --> 11:14.425
Nope. Just staring.

11:17.178 --> 11:19.263
You really
don't dream, do you?

11:20.181 --> 11:21.849
Never interested me.

11:23.309 --> 11:25.561
You read Santiago's e-mail?

11:27.855 --> 11:28.939
Let me guess,
you're excited.

11:29.273 --> 11:31.567
Fuck yeah, I'm excited.
We get to go to China.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.278
Yeah, well, just so you know,
I throw up on planes,

11:35.321 --> 11:37.448
so bring a raincoat
and nose plugs.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.243
Any updates on her?

11:41.327 --> 11:44.830
Surveillance said
she mostly stayed home
and then went to a yoga class.

11:45.373 --> 11:47.500
And they lost her again.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.794
I'm telling you,
it's hard to track
people in New York.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.012
Where's the she-devil?

12:02.348 --> 12:03.724
Don't know.

12:05.267 --> 12:06.394
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

12:06.477 --> 12:08.104
<i>Darlene's never
quiet unless...</i>

12:08.187 --> 12:09.939
Did the malware
not check out?

12:12.316 --> 12:13.442
It's Angela.

12:15.194 --> 12:17.488
You need to talk to her.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.365
About what?

12:19.448 --> 12:22.827
With the FBI at Evil Corp,
physical security is madness.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.037
We don't have time to prep a
new social engineering attack,

12:25.121 --> 12:27.790
so I went to her...
She can't be involved.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.542
What the hell else
do you want me to do?

12:29.625 --> 12:31.710
I am telling you,
it's a fortress.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.045
There's no way
in there right now,

12:33.129 --> 12:35.131
and it's not as if we
have a lot of time to wait.

12:35.506 --> 12:36.549
Darlene's right.

12:36.632 --> 12:37.800
I'm not doing it.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.468
Who better than
someone you trust?

12:39.552 --> 12:41.804
I'm not discussing
Angela with you.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.097
She's our only option.

12:43.264 --> 12:46.809
She's not an option.
Think of something else.

12:46.892 --> 12:50.438
I did my part.
Now you do yours.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.985
Make this happen.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.590
Minister Zhang,
pleasure to meet you.

13:59.673 --> 14:03.135
The pleasure is mine,
Mr. Santiago.
Welcome to China.

14:04.553 --> 14:05.596
Oh, here.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.316
Let's retire into the forum,
where we can talk in private.

14:19.902 --> 14:23.322
As you'll see in
your escorted tour
of Beijing's backup facility,

14:23.405 --> 14:26.408
our attack
was not climate control,
like your Raspberry Pi.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.953
Our backup tapes
were degaussed.

14:29.036 --> 14:32.081
We'd like to visit all four
of China's backup sites.

14:32.790 --> 14:33.832
Of course.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.000
And be granted access

14:35.084 --> 14:37.253
to the encrypted
E Corp servers.

14:38.546 --> 14:39.797
Absolutely.

14:42.424 --> 14:43.842
Excellent.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.010
Now,

14:46.804 --> 14:49.431
there is another subject
to discuss.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.228
We understand it is
a delicate subject.

14:54.395 --> 14:55.604
The Dark Army?

14:57.523 --> 15:00.818
We'd like to review
all intelligence
you have on them.

15:13.914 --> 15:18.127
It's just that
some of us think that,
you know,

15:18.377 --> 15:22.047
they, as a known
malevolent hacker group
might have...

15:22.298 --> 15:24.550
Of course.
We'll get you
all of our dossiers

15:24.633 --> 15:26.302
with any intel
we might have.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.513
You're scheduled to
visit our Beijing facility

15:29.597 --> 15:31.557
on Tuesday
at 9:00 a.m. sharp.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.476
Enjoy yourselves.
Take in the city.

15:34.810 --> 15:37.688
Monday night, I wish to
host you at my home.

15:37.771 --> 15:42.610
A reception to celebrate
our collaborative effort.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.538
You can't just do it
yourself?

17:18.497 --> 17:21.542
No, not without
access to the database.

17:22.710 --> 17:23.752
But you're the best.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.214
The master.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.383
Ain't that true?

17:31.593 --> 17:32.761
You got to understand.

17:32.970 --> 17:38.475
I hesitate because
RT and I didn't part ways
on the best of terms.

17:40.561 --> 17:43.313
I wouldn't ask
if there were another way.

17:44.606 --> 17:48.652
You're wasting time,
time we don't have.
You need to call Angela.

17:49.737 --> 17:51.655
Maxine, what's wrong,
girl?

17:52.197 --> 17:53.240
Shh.

17:53.449 --> 17:55.409
Don't make me
think the worst now.

17:58.203 --> 17:59.830
Is she okay?

18:04.293 --> 18:07.129
If you say you need him,
you must need him.

18:08.964 --> 18:11.008
I'll have RT stop by.

18:33.197 --> 18:36.241
I tracked
the last package
to the Midtown post office

18:36.325 --> 18:37.659
it was mailed from.

18:38.744 --> 18:40.829
However, there's no evidence
on the security footage

18:40.913 --> 18:43.123
of anyone mailing it
from inside the station.

18:43.499 --> 18:46.502
It was probably dropped
in a nearby collection box.

18:46.585 --> 18:49.546
And I have a contact
attempting to
trace the phone calls,

18:49.630 --> 18:51.131
but he needs more time.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.050
I'll keep you
updated as always.

18:54.927 --> 18:56.220
Good night, ma'am.

18:57.429 --> 18:58.555
And Kareem?

19:04.812 --> 19:05.854
I did as you asked.

19:15.405 --> 19:16.865
<i>It's framed burglary.</i>

19:17.950 --> 19:21.912
<i>Cops will likely
go after an ex-con
who lives on the same floor.</i>

19:21.995 --> 19:24.957
<i>MO matches other B&Es
the guy's suspected of.</i>

19:41.765 --> 19:43.100
<i>Tell me...</i>

19:44.142 --> 19:46.103
<i>Tell me about his death.</i>

19:49.273 --> 19:53.485
<i>Succinylcholine.
Injected as ordered.</i>

19:55.279 --> 19:57.656
<i>And he didn't feel anything?</i>

19:57.739 --> 20:00.284
<i>He was completely paralyzed.</i>

20:12.462 --> 20:14.548
<i>It'll appear
there was a struggle.</i>

20:14.631 --> 20:18.635
<i>He pulled his gun
in self-defense.
The attacker got him first.</i>

20:18.719 --> 20:19.928
<i>Two gunshot wounds.</i>

20:20.012 --> 20:22.848
<i>One to the chest,
another to the head.</i>

20:22.931 --> 20:26.977
<i>Did he look at you
before you finished the job?</i>

20:28.353 --> 20:30.147
<i>Yes.</i>

20:30.230 --> 20:34.568
<i>Ma'am, if I may,
why drug him?</i>

20:34.651 --> 20:37.863
<i>It would've been just as easy
to shoot and leave.</i>

20:37.946 --> 20:42.951
<i>Killing a man instantly
robs him of explanation.</i>

20:44.328 --> 20:48.123
<i>He has no time to
process his final moments.</i>

20:48.206 --> 20:50.584
<i>Now, even though
he was paralyzed,</i>

20:50.667 --> 20:55.589
<i>his mind was still
able to understand
why his life was ending.</i>

20:57.758 --> 20:59.718
We let him die
with answers.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.139
Otherwise,

21:05.933 --> 21:07.768
we're nothing but
ruthless murderers.

21:14.650 --> 21:16.109
Thank you.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.988
Hey.
Hi.

22:02.656 --> 22:05.951
I got to say, I never thought
I'd hear from you again.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.786
I ordered you a Bud Light.

22:07.869 --> 22:08.996
Thanks.

22:11.331 --> 22:15.002
You know, I'm glad
we're sitting here again.
Our old spot.

22:16.086 --> 22:19.423
You know, booth over there
by the window.

22:19.673 --> 22:22.759
Remember?
It's where I first said
the three magic words.

22:23.760 --> 22:24.803
Um...

22:25.345 --> 22:26.513
Yeah, I don't
think I remember that.

22:26.596 --> 22:29.725
"I love you."

22:33.353 --> 22:35.397
I meant it, too.

22:37.649 --> 22:39.943
I miss you, Angela.

22:41.153 --> 22:42.195
Thanks.

22:42.279 --> 22:45.949
Yeah, a lot of
good memories.

22:46.908 --> 22:49.286
Look, Josh Groban night.

22:51.413 --> 22:55.709
It's like we're, uh,
reliving our glory days.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.002
But, uh, you...

22:57.085 --> 22:59.963
Wow. I mean, I hear things
are going great with you.

23:00.881 --> 23:03.925
I hope this is cool
and not, like, weird,

23:04.009 --> 23:08.764
but, um, I brought
my résumé
if you can do anything.

23:12.559 --> 23:16.271
Well, I just figured, hey,
if there are any
open positions...

23:19.608 --> 23:21.318
I'll see what I can do.

23:22.402 --> 23:26.239
So, tell me.
How's life over there?

23:27.157 --> 23:28.825
Very different than Allsafe.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.161
You miss it?

23:31.828 --> 23:32.913
Yeah.

23:35.332 --> 23:37.292
And Gideon.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.419
Crazy sad.

23:40.837 --> 23:44.257
You know, I heard
the dude that shot him
was, like, off his rocker.

23:44.341 --> 23:46.551
One of those
Five/Nine truthers.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.762
Some people even say that
the whole thing

23:48.845 --> 23:50.847
was like a put-on.

23:50.931 --> 23:52.974
Like, uh, one of those

23:53.058 --> 23:55.519
crisis performances
or whatever.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.979
You know,
those Frank Cody types.

23:58.063 --> 24:00.690
Anyways,
tragic for sure.

24:02.192 --> 24:05.654
So, you ever think that CD
had anything to do with it?

24:17.082 --> 24:18.208
Excuse me?

24:18.667 --> 24:22.754
I'm just saying, like,
Allsafe was ground zero.

24:28.635 --> 24:30.303
What the fuck?

24:36.810 --> 24:38.145
Are you working
with the FBI?

24:38.603 --> 24:40.272
No, it's...

24:41.606 --> 24:43.316
My uncle is a lawyer.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.694
He told me to be careful
and record any suspicious...

24:45.777 --> 24:46.820
It's my uncle's fault.

24:46.945 --> 24:49.990
Fuck!
What...
Oh! Come on!

24:50.073 --> 24:52.826
My contract was
cleared because of the hack.
I can't afford a new phone.

24:52.993 --> 24:56.746
Answer me.
Honestly. Right now.

24:58.206 --> 25:00.083
Did you talk to the FBI?

25:00.959 --> 25:02.294
No.

25:03.086 --> 25:04.129
Yes.

25:04.421 --> 25:07.632
I mean, Angela, look,
they called me in,
like, three times.

25:07.966 --> 25:09.968
I can't sleep.
I am scared as shit.

25:10.218 --> 25:11.261
What did you tell them?

25:11.428 --> 25:12.512
Nothing.

25:12.721 --> 25:15.724
Just about the CD guy,
and then they did,
like, the sketch or whatever,

25:15.974 --> 25:17.309
the facial composite thing,
but I swear,

25:17.392 --> 25:18.935
I never said your name.
Oh, fuck.

25:19.603 --> 25:22.272
Where are you going?
Where...

25:44.169 --> 25:46.504
This food is not sanitary,
am I right?

25:46.588 --> 25:47.881
I mean, where's
the General Tso's chicken?

25:47.964 --> 25:50.217
I don't think that's a formal
hors d'oeuvre in China.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.385
Yeah? I'm gonna ask.

25:53.303 --> 25:57.724
This noodle bowl thing
made me gag.
These people are savages.

26:18.036 --> 26:20.121
Excuse me, do you know
where the bathroom is?

26:21.581 --> 26:23.708
Bathroom? Uh...

26:24.042 --> 26:25.794
Toilet?

26:25.877 --> 26:26.920
No English?

26:27.003 --> 26:28.046
No English.

26:28.129 --> 26:30.465
Okay, thank you.

27:10.755 --> 27:12.090
Pardon me,
do you have the time?

27:12.215 --> 27:13.508
Oh, shit.

27:15.593 --> 27:17.262
Minister Zhang, I...

27:19.055 --> 27:23.601
I was just admiring...
Looking at... For the...

27:25.061 --> 27:26.479
Right, the time
'cause of the...

27:26.688 --> 27:29.024
You've wandered
very far from the party.

27:29.107 --> 27:31.526
I was looking for
the little girls' room,
and then I...

27:31.609 --> 27:33.903
And this caught your eye?

27:36.614 --> 27:37.949
Yeah, I...

27:40.160 --> 27:41.494
I know it seems
a little uncanny,

27:41.578 --> 27:45.874
but my parents
had the same clock
in our family room growing up.

27:45.957 --> 27:48.960
I found this in Germany.
The town of Rothenburg.

27:49.127 --> 27:52.797
Cost me a fortune.
The seller told me
that it was one of a kind.

27:54.382 --> 27:56.718
So much for
the honest salesman.

27:56.801 --> 27:59.304
My parents bought theirs
at a Kmart in Teaneck.

28:00.513 --> 28:01.556
Oh.

28:01.639 --> 28:03.475
Is that where
you're from, Miss...

28:03.600 --> 28:05.393
Jersey born and raised.

28:05.602 --> 28:08.646
And my full name
is Dominique DiPierro,
but I go by Dom.

28:08.730 --> 28:12.650
Or Agent DiPierro,
or just Dom.

28:14.527 --> 28:19.199
So, if I can ask,
what's the deal
with the clocks?

28:19.282 --> 28:21.618
Is it a punctuality thing?

28:23.286 --> 28:26.414
"Life is but
a walking shadow.

28:26.498 --> 28:28.958
"A poor player
that struts and frets

28:29.042 --> 28:31.795
"his hour upon the stage,

28:31.878 --> 28:34.422
"and then is heard no more."

28:37.133 --> 28:40.720
You've surrounded yourself
with the constant
reminder of mortality.

28:41.429 --> 28:44.432
There's much work
to do, great work.

28:44.516 --> 28:48.645
As each second passes,
I push myself to keep moving.

28:50.313 --> 28:53.358
You're making me think
I should invest
in a decent watch.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.780
Now, if I may ask,

28:58.863 --> 29:00.365
how does a young
woman from New Jersey

29:00.448 --> 29:01.783
find her way into the FBI?

29:05.995 --> 29:07.622
I was...

29:07.705 --> 29:08.998
I am

29:10.333 --> 29:14.003
disgusted by
the selfish brutality
of the world,

29:14.087 --> 29:18.091
but at the same time,
I'm utterly fascinated by it.

29:18.174 --> 29:21.761
The FBI's a perfect place
for that kind
of contradiction.

29:23.555 --> 29:26.307
I have something in my office
I think you might appreciate.

29:29.644 --> 29:32.605
The artist strives to reflect
the desolation and anxiety

29:32.689 --> 29:36.151
that accompanies
one's loss of identity.

29:36.234 --> 29:39.779
His message is subversive
to many in our country.

29:39.863 --> 29:42.198
Nevertheless, the work
appeals to the masses

29:43.366 --> 29:45.493
and to the individual.

29:45.577 --> 29:49.247
How is it that
revolution can create
such beautiful art,

29:49.330 --> 29:51.082
yet you and I are
tracking revolutionaries

29:51.166 --> 29:53.835
who've created
nothing but turmoil?

29:56.463 --> 29:57.630
There's more to the story.

29:59.466 --> 30:00.717
I'm sorry?

30:00.842 --> 30:02.051
FBI.

30:02.677 --> 30:04.220
Why you joined.

30:06.806 --> 30:08.266
What was it?

30:09.559 --> 30:11.394
It's a little personal.

30:12.479 --> 30:15.607
That's precisely
why I'm asking.

30:17.233 --> 30:18.276
Oh.

30:21.446 --> 30:22.822
Okay.

30:24.032 --> 30:25.074
Um...

30:27.911 --> 30:30.747
Well, it was
a certain relationship.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.667
A love story?

30:36.544 --> 30:39.339
Of sorts. Sort of, sure.

30:40.423 --> 30:43.885
Final semester of law school,
dating who I thought
was the one.

30:44.802 --> 30:48.348
At dinner,
days before graduation,

30:49.599 --> 30:52.477
they got down on one knee
to propose, and...

30:58.733 --> 31:01.361
This is gonna
make me sound wacky,

31:02.445 --> 31:05.865
but I excused
myself to the restroom
and went out the back,

31:08.535 --> 31:09.577
and that was that.

31:10.954 --> 31:13.206
Fast-forward several years,
I turn around

31:13.289 --> 31:15.917
and here's what
I picked instead.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.835
A mid-level field agent.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.719
What is it?
I just...

31:26.803 --> 31:27.845
Uh...

31:28.471 --> 31:32.892
I never would have expected
to be talking
about an old flame

31:32.976 --> 31:34.686
to China's Minister
of State Security.

31:35.770 --> 31:37.021
Ah.

31:38.815 --> 31:41.484
It'll make a good story
at Thanksgiving.
My dad will love it.

31:53.496 --> 31:55.123
Whose room is this?

32:02.672 --> 32:03.881
Wow.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.260
These are gorgeous.

32:07.343 --> 32:09.095
A <i>magua,</i>

32:09.178 --> 32:12.599
the common Manchu clothing
of the Qing Dynasty.

32:12.682 --> 32:14.142
Detailed
embroidery such as this

32:14.225 --> 32:16.686
was often reserved
for the royal families.

32:18.229 --> 32:22.692
This is a modern
<i>qípáo</i> by Jin Zhi Yu Ye.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.110
Purchased in Shanghai.

32:24.193 --> 32:27.030
The silk fabric
and embroidered lace
are unrivaled. Here.

32:33.411 --> 32:34.454
Wow.

32:37.457 --> 32:40.126
I've never touched
something so beautiful.

32:40.460 --> 32:43.171
I feel the same way
each time.

32:45.715 --> 32:47.383
Where did these come from?

32:49.552 --> 32:51.387
They belong to my sister.

32:52.013 --> 32:54.724
She stays here
when she's passing
through Beijing.

33:00.897 --> 33:03.149
Let me ask, Ms. DiPierro,

33:04.651 --> 33:07.820
have you ever wondered
how the world would look

33:07.904 --> 33:10.073
if the Five/Nine
hack never happened?

33:11.366 --> 33:14.661
How the world
would look right now?

33:14.744 --> 33:18.122
In fact, some believe
there are alternate realities

33:18.206 --> 33:21.167
playing out
that very scenario,

33:21.250 --> 33:23.920
with other lives
that we're leading,

33:25.296 --> 33:29.050
other people
that we've become.

33:36.599 --> 33:39.977
The contemplation moves me
very deeply.

33:49.112 --> 33:51.781
Oh, you weren't kidding.
You really do have a thing...

33:52.073 --> 33:55.618
I apologize, I must go.
May I escort you
back to the party?

34:24.564 --> 34:27.191
Why are you here?

34:27.275 --> 34:28.860
Because I want to be.

34:30.778 --> 34:32.822
I told Darlene
I didn't want you involved.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.616
She was right
to involve me.

34:35.700 --> 34:38.619
Please don't do this.
I'll find another way.

34:38.703 --> 34:40.913
Darlene said
it's a simple job.

34:41.205 --> 34:44.584
I place the device on
the floor and walk away.

34:45.835 --> 34:48.921
Then you guys will
make everything go away,
any evidence that you find.

34:49.005 --> 34:50.465
That's true, right?

34:52.383 --> 34:55.136
Right?
That's our plan,

34:55.219 --> 34:56.929
but that's not the point.

34:57.013 --> 34:58.473
Don't put yourself at risk.

34:58.556 --> 35:00.349
I've run through my options.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.351
Best-case scenario,
I lose my job

35:02.477 --> 35:04.270
and plea-bargain
down a jail sentence.

35:05.062 --> 35:09.192
I'm backed into a corner.
Either I act,
or I wait to get caught.

35:13.404 --> 35:14.739
I told myself
that I would wait

35:14.822 --> 35:16.073
to decide until I saw you,

35:16.157 --> 35:17.867
because you wouldn't
let me walk into this

35:17.950 --> 35:20.495
unless you were sure
that you could pull it off.

35:26.834 --> 35:28.377
I've decided.

35:35.510 --> 35:38.346
I miss you.
You know that, right?

35:40.973 --> 35:44.894
I reached out to
you so many times,
and you kept saying no.

35:46.604 --> 35:48.481
Can I just know why?

35:51.859 --> 35:56.531
I keep thinking about
that day on
the train platform.

35:57.532 --> 36:00.201
After you found
me in the cemetery.

36:02.036 --> 36:04.038
You told me to
take care of myself.

36:06.040 --> 36:08.000
I wanted to be okay.

36:10.545 --> 36:16.509
I wanted to stop seeing him
before I talked to you again.

36:18.886 --> 36:20.471
And?

36:27.645 --> 36:30.731
And my dead father's
standing behind you right now.

36:46.581 --> 36:48.583
I can be a friend.

36:50.668 --> 36:52.420
Someone to talk to.

36:54.088 --> 36:56.424
Someone who cares about you.

36:58.301 --> 37:00.678
Who knows?
Maybe that will help.

37:05.808 --> 37:07.184
How's Qwerty?

37:09.437 --> 37:10.813
He's good.

37:13.107 --> 37:17.111
He's fat. I think
I'm feeding him too much.

37:22.992 --> 37:24.201
This is
the federal bailout.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.037
All right, this is critical,
and you're just backing out

37:26.120 --> 37:27.830
of our biggest operation?

37:27.914 --> 37:29.332
This isn't open for debate.

37:29.415 --> 37:32.501
I can't go, and it's none
of your goddamn business why.

37:36.130 --> 37:41.260
I want you to lead
the D.C. op.
You're being promoted.

37:41.802 --> 37:44.805
Take the crew down
to the Capitol tonight
and begin prepping.

37:44.889 --> 37:46.015
You serious? Really?

37:46.432 --> 37:50.811
Well, you've done good.
Now take charge.
Act like a leader.

37:51.062 --> 37:54.357
This is a very
serious opportunity.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.400
You know the plan, right?
Oh, yeah.

37:56.525 --> 37:59.904
Good. Don't forget
the package.

37:59.987 --> 38:03.157
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate this.
I'm not gonna let you down.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.034
All right,
I'm gonna do you proud.

38:05.117 --> 38:06.160
And they're
gonna remember...

38:06.243 --> 38:07.912
Okay, just do your job
and stop acting
like such a pussy.

38:07.995 --> 38:09.372
I got to take this.

38:11.499 --> 38:12.792
Hello?

38:15.795 --> 38:17.213
When?

38:24.345 --> 38:28.557
There's an encrypted
users database
in the marketplace directory.

38:28.641 --> 38:30.393
Here, um, just...

38:31.435 --> 38:32.687
Let me try.

38:40.486 --> 38:43.030
You gonna ask or just stare?

38:44.532 --> 38:46.033
Okay, what happened?

38:49.537 --> 38:52.206
It was a rhetorical question.
Just stare.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.629
<i>This guy
obviously knows his shit.</i>

38:59.755 --> 39:02.133
<i>Why did Ray come to me?</i>

39:17.064 --> 39:22.319
Then you'll, um,
transfer the archives
to the local machine.

39:38.252 --> 39:41.005
And then transfer the existing
site from the local machine

39:41.088 --> 39:43.507
to the new server.

40:34.141 --> 40:36.143
You don't know when to stop!

40:36.811 --> 40:41.649
This is what you wanted,
remember?
Me, here at a terminal.

41:23.107 --> 41:24.400
Good to go.

41:25.776 --> 41:26.861
Check on it if you need to.

41:36.370 --> 41:39.456
<i>Everyone has
their own if/then
conditional programming,</i>

41:39.540 --> 41:42.293
<i>a situation where
if certain conditions are met,</i>

41:42.376 --> 41:44.545
<i>then a logic bomb detonates.</i>

41:44.628 --> 41:46.714
<i>Everything blows
up in your face.</i>

41:47.715 --> 41:51.135
<i>Is this Ray's
if/then moment or my own?</i>

42:31.592 --> 42:34.762
<i>If Ray is running
the site himself,
why bring me in?</i>

42:34.845 --> 42:37.223
<i>Maybe he doesn't know
the evil that he's spreading.</i>

42:37.306 --> 42:40.184
<i>Maybe he has no idea
what's on the site.</i>

42:40.267 --> 42:45.356
<i>Ray is protective, kind.
Ray is dangerous, a criminal.</i>

42:45.439 --> 42:48.984
<i>Are those his two halves?
Which side of him is stronger?</i>

42:49.068 --> 42:51.070
<i>Is he sinister
enough to host the...</i>

42:51.153 --> 42:54.323
Stop figuring this out.

42:54.406 --> 42:56.492
I want to know.

42:56.825 --> 42:58.118
You know.

42:59.745 --> 43:02.164
But you're going to ignore it.

43:02.248 --> 43:04.416
You want to know why?

43:04.500 --> 43:06.252
Because that's what we do.

43:08.504 --> 43:10.714
It's not what I do.

43:12.925 --> 43:15.094
And if he's guilty,

43:15.177 --> 43:19.098
I could destroy him
in under two minutes
at a terminal.

43:19.348 --> 43:21.016
Are we really
back to this again?

43:21.100 --> 43:23.936
Ray is not some
coffee shop owner.

43:24.144 --> 43:27.106
Forget what you
saw and move on.

43:30.276 --> 43:32.278
You're thinking
only of yourself.

43:33.654 --> 43:35.614
I'm thinking of us.

43:37.700 --> 43:41.370
And I'm thinking of the people
in those pictures.

43:46.458 --> 43:48.460
I could help them.

43:52.756 --> 43:55.718
We have
other battles to fight.

44:00.764 --> 44:02.141
What else is new?

44:10.232 --> 44:13.152
<i>A logic bomb explodes
either at a set time</i>

44:13.235 --> 44:15.571
<i>or when a specific
condition is met.</i>

44:15.654 --> 44:18.365
<i>And now I've met Ray's
black market of evil.</i>

44:18.449 --> 44:22.703
<i>Mr. Robot can
deny it all he wants,
but I can't.</i>

44:22.786 --> 44:24.246
<i>Can you?</i>

44:39.386 --> 44:40.554
Hello?

44:50.939 --> 44:52.024
Tyrell...

46:57.983 --> 46:59.151
Were you followed?

47:00.777 --> 47:03.614
No, I don't think so.

47:03.697 --> 47:05.407
Did you take
the route I sent you?

47:05.491 --> 47:07.743
Yeah.

47:07.826 --> 47:09.369
Where's your cell phone?

47:09.453 --> 47:11.163
At home.

47:11.788 --> 47:15.000
No bullshit from here on.
Understand?

47:39.483 --> 47:41.610
Oh, my head is pounding.

47:41.693 --> 47:43.946
Way too much of that
baijiu drink last night.

47:44.029 --> 47:46.740
Speaking of, where'd you go?

47:46.823 --> 47:49.618
I got stuck listening to Jesse
trying to speak Chinese.

47:49.701 --> 47:51.828
He made a lot of
people really uncomfortable.

47:51.912 --> 47:53.872
Oh, you know,
your average evening.

47:53.956 --> 47:56.792
A private tour from
Minister Zhang himself.

47:56.875 --> 47:59.836
What?
Was he putting
moves on you?

47:59.920 --> 48:01.838
No, not like that.

48:01.922 --> 48:06.093
But he did take me
to his sister's bedroom
and showed me her clothes.

48:06.885 --> 48:08.345
That's sort of weird.

48:08.428 --> 48:12.140
Mmm-hmm. Even more so when
you consider Minister Zhang
doesn't have a sister.

48:12.224 --> 48:14.351
Nice look, Hollywood.

48:15.435 --> 48:18.772
Thanks.
I got myself all gussied up
for the field trip.

48:18.855 --> 48:21.149
Where's Santiago?
On another rampage.

48:21.233 --> 48:23.151
ADIC called with updates
about the Raspberry Pi.

48:23.235 --> 48:24.528
Great.
Not great.

48:24.611 --> 48:27.739
Turns out the guy who found it
smudged his fat
fingers all over it,

48:27.823 --> 48:29.491
smearing any possible prints.

48:29.575 --> 48:31.118
Another dead end.

48:31.201 --> 48:32.661
When Santiago stomped off,
he was threatening

48:32.744 --> 48:35.080
to reach
through his cell phone
and castrate the guy.

48:35.163 --> 48:36.456
Fantastic.

48:37.416 --> 48:40.752
Think I'm gonna
need more caffeine
to survive the day.

49:35.849 --> 49:37.434
Hey! Hey!

49:37.726 --> 49:39.686
Help! Help!

49:42.397 --> 49:46.693
Stop! Help! Help!

49:50.280 --> 49:51.323
Fuck.

49:55.619 --> 49:58.664
You are one stupid fuck.

50:00.499 --> 50:02.501
Never trust a tech
guy with a rat tail.

50:03.752 --> 50:05.754
Too easy to carve
secrets out of him.

50:19.184 --> 50:20.602
Ray,

50:21.812 --> 50:23.730
what are you doing?

50:24.690 --> 50:26.149
I told you not to look.
