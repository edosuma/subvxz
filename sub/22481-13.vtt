00:01.035 --> 00:02.770
HONDO:
Previously on S.W.A.T...

00:02.836 --> 00:05.406
This is more than just
hooking up at this point.
I'm your boss now.

00:05.473 --> 00:07.275
Being together
could cost us our jobs.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.043
It's a stupid
department policy.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.211
JESSICA: It's dangerous.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.413
Hicks is sucking up
to Michael Plank.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.148
I know that name.
President
of the police commission?

00:14.215 --> 00:15.249
Commissioner Plank.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.650
So, I wanted to
ask you if you had

00:16.717 --> 00:18.852
any thoughts or suggestions
on my policing proposals.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.589
So, this proposal outlines
what I call an "ethics panel."

00:21.655 --> 00:23.791
I think you're gonna need
my help to get these approved.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.227
The reason why
I didn't forward your
proposal to Plank before

00:26.294 --> 00:28.562
is because it's gonna
turn a lot of good cops
against you.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.299
I think she's destined
for bigger things
than just S.W.A.T.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.068
* We got guns

00:34.135 --> 00:35.536
* You better run

00:35.603 --> 00:40.308
* You better run
You better run

00:40.374 --> 00:44.078
* You better run

00:44.145 --> 00:46.880
* We're killing strangers

00:48.149 --> 00:51.785
* We're killing strangers

00:51.852 --> 00:54.422
* We're killing strangers

00:54.488 --> 01:00.094
* So we don't kill
the ones that we love

01:00.161 --> 01:02.730
* We're killing strangers

01:03.731 --> 01:06.667
* We're killing strangers

01:08.169 --> 01:10.671
* We're killing strangers...

01:10.738 --> 01:11.872
What about her?

01:12.973 --> 01:14.142
OCHOA: Him.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.710
* The ones that we love

01:18.979 --> 01:20.681
* Love

01:23.284 --> 01:25.453
* Love

01:27.455 --> 01:29.457
* Love... *

01:33.761 --> 01:36.830
JESSICA:
Ella está hecha de viento,

01:36.897 --> 01:41.202
de fuerza que ningún
hombre puede igualar.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.571
Ella está en riesgo.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.105
Porque ella es fuego.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.374
"Es fuego."

01:46.440 --> 01:49.810
A poem my mom
used to say to me.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.379
The woman is born of fire,

01:51.445 --> 01:53.080
and society wants to tame her.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.649
Tame her?

01:55.716 --> 01:57.218
Why would they
want to do that?

02:05.459 --> 02:08.028
Hicks wants your team on
an ICE raid in Van Nuys.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.563
They move in an hour.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.065
I thought our policy
was hands-off when it
comes to federal raids.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.035
Target's an L-2D gang member.

02:15.102 --> 02:16.237
Toro Ochoa.

02:16.304 --> 02:17.471
ICE is asking for support.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.076
Time to go.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.980
Mmm.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.754
Oh, this isn't good.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.089
Oh, no. We've been found out.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.895
Someone leaked
the accountability proposal
to the press.

02:41.962 --> 02:43.897
My name, Commissioner Plank's,

02:43.964 --> 02:45.866
our review panel
on "use of force."

02:45.933 --> 02:47.601
You weren't planning
to go wide yet.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.870
I wanted to sell it
to the rank and file
before it went public.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.405
Some cops
might feel blindsided.

02:51.472 --> 02:55.008
Michael took a chance on me,
on my ideas
to reform the department.

02:55.075 --> 02:57.044
You and Michael seem like
you've been working
pretty hard.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.380
But it won't matter
if we can't get the
department on board.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.181
This could ruin everything.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.783
Okay, stop, Jess.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.652
Don't worry about it.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.555
Everything's gonna be okay.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.156
One problem at a time.

03:12.826 --> 03:13.961
Thanks.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.263
Mmm-hmm.
Be safe.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.733
Piece of cake.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.613
Federal agents!
This is a raid.
We want Toro Ochoa.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.947
AGENT: All right,
get 'em up! Let's go!

03:34.014 --> 03:35.316
JONES: Federal agents.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.117
AGENT: Outside!

03:37.184 --> 03:38.886
JONES: We want Toro Ochoa.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.955
AGENT: All right, let's go.
Get moving. Let's go.
Hey. Hey!

03:42.022 --> 03:44.392
On the ground!
Stay right there.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.427
On your knees.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.397
Stay right there.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.832
AGENT: Hey. Hey!

03:54.402 --> 03:55.469
AGENT:
Get on the ground.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.237
Get on the ground.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.072
Toro Ochoa.

03:59.139 --> 04:00.608
You seen him?

04:01.342 --> 04:02.376
He around?

04:03.544 --> 04:04.645
How about you?

04:04.712 --> 04:07.381
Sir, the apartments
are all cleared.

04:07.448 --> 04:10.618
There's no sign of Ochoa.
Start checking IDs.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.686
FEMALE AGENT: Stop!

04:12.753 --> 04:14.955
This is Agent Jones.
We have a breach. Ten...

04:15.022 --> 04:16.189
Twelve suspects.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.525
Roger that.
Perimeter's covered.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.259
You ready?
Set.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.695
There!

04:21.762 --> 04:23.531
LAPD! Stop right there!

04:23.597 --> 04:25.098
On the ground!

04:28.235 --> 04:29.603
Get on the ground now!

04:31.805 --> 04:33.140
We got two rabbits.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.842
LAPD, don't move!

04:34.908 --> 04:36.444
Street, let's go.
Deacon, cover him.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.579
I got beanie boy.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.858
Chill out!

04:50.924 --> 04:51.925
You're done.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.295
STREET:
LAPD! Stop!

04:58.832 --> 05:00.033
Give me your hands!

05:00.100 --> 05:02.503
I got the runner.
I didn't do anything wrong.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.304
Shouldn't have run, then.
Good work, Officer.

05:07.274 --> 05:08.642
You have any ID on him?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.884
Metro pass.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.251
Carlos Acosta.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.521
You know Toro Ochoa?
No, sir.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.255
I just live in the building.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.624
I have nothing to do
with criminals.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.426
You a UDA?
Undocumented alien?

05:25.493 --> 05:26.894
Thought so.

05:26.960 --> 05:27.961
Give him to me.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.235
STREET:
I thought we were supposed to
be going after gang members.

05:35.302 --> 05:36.970
He look like one to you?

05:37.037 --> 05:38.506
No.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.307
But this is ICE's op, Street.

05:41.475 --> 05:42.610
And we follow the law.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.679
Let's get out of here.

05:47.581 --> 05:50.283
Hondo. Heard we're
taking over an ICE case.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.585
Toro Ochoa.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.454
L-2D wanted for murder.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.656
ICE's intel didn't pan out,
so they're moving on.

05:55.723 --> 05:56.990
Now they want us
to track him down.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.592
Our city, our problem?

05:58.659 --> 06:00.894
They're gonna
coordinate with Cortez.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.064
Sure she has time,
or is she too busy
making things hard for us?

06:04.131 --> 06:07.200
Stricter rules on cops.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.970
Who the hell does she think
the bad guys are?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.439
Look, I haven't read
all the details,

06:11.505 --> 06:14.007
but it seems to me any officer
who does their job right

06:14.074 --> 06:15.476
shouldn't have any issues.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.977
If Cortez thinks the problem

06:17.044 --> 06:19.079
between the police
and the community
are the cops,

06:19.146 --> 06:20.247
I got news for her.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.615
All right, let's
just take a beat.

06:21.682 --> 06:22.983
Hear Cortez and Plank out.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.485
Yeah, remember that
when you're being reviewed

06:24.552 --> 06:26.520
and someone like Ochoa
kills somebody.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.423
Hey, Hondo.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.858
Our boy's on the news.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.593
NEWSREADER:
In a raid this morning,

06:32.660 --> 06:36.129
an LAPD officer
is seen here handing
a suspect's ID

06:36.196 --> 06:38.231
over to a federal official.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.934
My brother Carlos
is a good man.
He is not a criminal,

06:41.001 --> 06:45.338
and he is not in a gang,
and now because of this
officer he's being deported?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.274
I thought the police
were different here.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.610
By arresting my brother,
they've broken their promises

06:49.677 --> 06:50.711
to this community.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.045
HICKS: Officer Street.

06:53.481 --> 06:56.049
Did you unilaterally decide
to change city policy

06:56.116 --> 06:58.185
in regards to how the LAPD
interacts with locals?

06:58.251 --> 06:59.286
No.
Really?

06:59.352 --> 07:00.921
Because up there,
it looks like

07:00.988 --> 07:03.591
you're handing over
a man's ID
to a federal officer.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.993
Los Angeles
is a sanctuary city.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.260
Don't have to agree with it,

07:07.327 --> 07:09.597
but that's the playbook
the mayor drew up.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.465
Now, we all know
why she did that, right?

07:11.532 --> 07:14.434
The UDAs in the city
will be afraid to come forward
and report their crimes.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.669
It's close to
a half a million people.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.204
And we need their trust.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.339
Now, I got five
city council members
on my phone sheet.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.674
They're pissed.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.375
Think we violated
community loyalty.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.244
ICE asked me for his ID.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.213
What was I supposed
to do, tell him no?

07:26.279 --> 07:29.449
Sir, the immigration beef
between the Feds and the
locals is way over our heads.

07:29.517 --> 07:32.219
Yeah, well, this city
has a delicate truce.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.088
And now because of him,
they think we picked sides.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.924
Get your team in
order, Sergeant.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.926
And while you're at it,
find Toro Ochoa

07:38.992 --> 07:41.094
so the press
has something else
to chew on.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.534
Street.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.904
You get the optics
on this, right?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.873
That lady on the news,
what it looks like to her.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.207
We didn't raid the place.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.176
The feds did.
The feds are gone, Street.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.278
That leaves just us
to take the heat.

08:03.717 --> 08:06.086
Hey. Listen,
we got a situation
going on here.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.123
Where are you?

08:11.592 --> 08:13.360
What?

08:13.426 --> 08:14.762
All right. Stay right there.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.765
All right, listen,
you guys dig into Ochoa.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.366
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.905
JESSICA: I saw the
news about the raid.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.140
I was headed into the office
when I found my car like this.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.877
I doubt it's a coincidence.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.279
The same day the anti-bias
proposal was leaked.

08:33.614 --> 08:34.982
You think a cop did this?

08:35.048 --> 08:36.216
I know there'd be pushback,
but...

08:36.283 --> 08:37.985
We'll get to the bottom of it.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.553
I want to get you
some protection.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.121
I can protect myself.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.224
Hey.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.926
I know you can.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.710
* *

09:35.709 --> 09:38.846
So, here's what ICE sent over
on Toro Ochoa.
I don't get it.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.614
We provide support for an op,

09:40.681 --> 09:43.116
provide backup when
they can't corral anyone,
I get in trouble?

09:43.183 --> 09:44.685
Well, you're not in trouble.
A crime's a crime.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.386
Carlos Acosta came to
this country illegally

09:46.453 --> 09:48.922
just like Toro Ochoa did.
Oh, that's not in
the same league.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.523
House painter versus
murderous gang leader?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.793
Yeah, no.
Look, I'm not saying
that they're equal.

09:52.860 --> 09:56.163
Carlos Acosta
broke the law by coming into
and staying in this country.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.631
We only gonna enforce
some of the laws now?

09:57.698 --> 09:58.932
All right, hey.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.233
Acosta's a thing,

10:00.300 --> 10:01.669
but he's not our thing.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.671
Now, we all can agree
that Ochoa is a criminal.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.072
Now, where are we at with him?

10:05.138 --> 10:06.940
Well, he's a recruiter
for Los Diablos Dormidos.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.643
The L-2Ds.
The Sleeping Devils.
They're bad news.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.544
We didn't have those down
in Long Beach. Who are they?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.847
See the world as their
own personal hell.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.248
Motto's "blood, rape, kill."

10:15.315 --> 10:16.483
Most of them are undocumented.

10:16.549 --> 10:17.951
They crossed in
from El Salvador.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.586
Ochoa uses that angle,

10:19.653 --> 10:22.289
offers protection
to the recruits
to get them into the fold.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.858
Oh, look at that.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.160
One of the guys
that we swept up today
wants to talk.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.696
Deacon, you're with me.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.131
The rest of you
dig into Ochoa's jacket.
Got it.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.233
Everything okay?

10:33.300 --> 10:34.668
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.569
It's just Cortez is
catching a lot of flack

10:36.636 --> 10:38.438
for her new reform proposals.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.075
Tan, you got a new girl?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.611
Street does.
Lots of them.
He's trending on Twitter.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.279
Hashtag CuteBadCop.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.548
Yeah, way to go, player.

10:48.615 --> 10:51.584
You're the early leader
for the next
Jackass of the Month Award.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.821
TAN: Heh. He's a shoo-in.
Start saving your money,
Street.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.155
Yes.

10:55.222 --> 10:58.258
Before I narc on Ochoa,
I want protection.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.928
I want to know that I'm not
going back to San Sal.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.430
Only the Feds make
those kinds of deals, Messa.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.633
Come on. I came here to get
away from guys like Ochoa.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.769
I was only with him
'cause he would've
killed me if I wasn't.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.037
HONDO: Right.

11:10.103 --> 11:13.106
And... He made me do things.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.574
Like killing that city
worker on the street?

11:14.641 --> 11:15.843
Hey, Lepo, he helped me
with that, too.

11:17.711 --> 11:20.714
Look, just keep me away
from Ochoa, okay?

11:20.781 --> 11:23.283
Only if you got
something for us.

11:26.486 --> 11:29.957
If you're looking for him,
he likes music.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.796
All right, thanks.
Hey, Ochoa is a metalhead.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.798
That's what this guy
told Hondo and Deacon?
How's that help us?

11:37.865 --> 11:39.566
Heavy metal's dead in L.A.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.101
Not in Pico-Union,
it's not.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.603
Yeah, downtown, East Side,
that's Los Dormidos territory.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.238
Right, I worked a
Vice sting at a bar

11:45.305 --> 11:46.673
for metalheads
a couple years ago.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.308
Maybe someone there
crossed paths with Ochoa

11:48.375 --> 11:49.943
or knows where he's hiding.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.411
All right,
I'm texting the boss.
It's worth a shot.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.480
New hashtag,
SupportS.W.A.T.Street.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.449
Hey, shout-outs from, uh,
pro-cop groups, badge bunnies,

11:56.516 --> 11:59.052
and...
Oh, there's a swastika in
this one's profile pic.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.588
Yeah, never mind.
We need to shut this down.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.590
Shut it down? Face it,
Street, you're viral.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.425
You have to stop caring what
people think about you.

12:05.492 --> 12:06.960
I don't. But this throws
shade at all of us.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.829
No, that's why we keep
our heads down. Do the work.

12:08.896 --> 12:09.930
We were doing the work.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.498
Street, you know
what I'm saying.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.000
I know, okay,
the city needs to see

12:13.066 --> 12:14.634
we're there for them.
So let's show 'em.

12:14.701 --> 12:17.537
PROTESTERS:
We belong! Justice! We belong!

12:17.604 --> 12:20.941
Justice! We belong!
Justice! We belong!

12:21.008 --> 12:23.276
Justice! We belong! Justice!

12:23.343 --> 12:26.079
We belong! Justice! We belong!

12:26.146 --> 12:27.915
Justice! We belong!

12:27.981 --> 12:30.417
Think I don't
see you, Officer?

12:30.483 --> 12:33.053
My brother is innocent.
You arrested an innocent man.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.961
You have any idea
what it's like

12:41.028 --> 12:42.695
to have someone you love
taken away from you?

12:43.330 --> 12:44.531
Car.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.838
Look, the feds won't
tell me where he is.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.440
Do you know?
Did they tell you?

12:53.506 --> 12:54.908
Ms. Acosta,
I want to help you.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.310
I wish I could,
but this isn't our fight.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.112
I'm sorry.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.919
You see the protest
going on outside?

13:05.986 --> 13:08.721
Yeah. We'll keep
an eye on it.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.190
Hicks have any leads
on your car?

13:10.257 --> 13:13.226
No. I'm not sure he's
my best ally right now.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.462
Let me know when you get
something on Ochoa.

13:15.528 --> 13:16.830
All right.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.132
Michael.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.433
Is there a place
we can talk?

13:21.902 --> 13:23.170
I've been trying
to call you.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.637
Did you see the
proposals were leaked?

13:25.605 --> 13:28.508
We have a bigger issue.

13:28.575 --> 13:32.179
Is there something you
want to tell me about you
and Sergeant Harrelson?

13:32.245 --> 13:34.347
Oh, just now in the hall?
He's concerned about my car

13:34.414 --> 13:36.950
because it was vandalized
this morning.
Your car?

13:37.017 --> 13:39.052
Yeah, it might be backlash
from the proposals.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.553
I'm not sure yet.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.025
How would you describe your
relationship with Hondo?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.562
He's a great cop.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.732
I trust his opinion a lot.

13:52.799 --> 13:56.503
In fact, given how quickly
he was thrown into his job
as team leader,

13:56.569 --> 13:58.805
he's exceeded my expectations.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.308
Did he exceed your
expectations when he was
kissing you this morning?

14:02.943 --> 14:05.045
I was in your neighborhood
meeting with an outreach
group,

14:05.112 --> 14:06.413
saw the proposals
hit the press,

14:06.479 --> 14:07.714
wanted to try to
strategize with you.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.149
Michael, whatever
you think you saw...

14:09.216 --> 14:11.184
I saw you being intimate with
one of your subordinates.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.591
Have you disclosed
this relationship
to the department?

14:20.793 --> 14:22.595
This is none of your business.

14:22.662 --> 14:23.964
Have you?

14:26.666 --> 14:28.068
No.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.903
Of course not,

14:29.970 --> 14:31.604
'cause then one of you
would have to transfer.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.640
We thought if we never let it
interfere with work...

14:33.706 --> 14:35.943
Which it hasn't, ever.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.011
I promise.
Really?

14:38.078 --> 14:39.980
We've co-authored
controversial proposals

14:40.047 --> 14:41.915
to hold cops accountable
for their actions

14:41.982 --> 14:43.516
and you're engaged
in unethical conduct.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.219
I wouldn't consider it
unethical.
Of course you wouldn't.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.587
But your bosses would.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.389
And anyone else who wanted
to kill these ideas would.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.560
Do you understand what
you've done to me here?

14:56.930 --> 14:58.631
You and I both know
these proposals

14:58.698 --> 14:59.699
will be better
for the city,

15:01.068 --> 15:04.171
but our enemies will look
for any edge they can get.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.940
And you're in a relationship
with an officer
under your command?

15:07.007 --> 15:10.010
And now what? You... You
expect me to cover it up?
Hmm?

15:10.077 --> 15:11.311
Take the fall
with the two of you

15:11.378 --> 15:13.346
when it eventually all
comes out, which it will?

15:14.948 --> 15:16.483
I made a mistake.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.552
And I'm sorry.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.859
Who else knows about this?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.095
No one.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.663
No one.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.368
What do you want me to do?

15:36.569 --> 15:38.005
You can't have both.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.539
It's the proposals or him.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.241
You decide what
you want to do.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.120
(IF I'M DEAD
BY HOGAN'S GOAT PLAYING)

15:55.588 --> 15:57.524
LUCA:
Guess music really does
bring people together.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.945
The last time you said that,
you drank a bottle
of our best Patrón,

16:19.012 --> 16:20.847
and then arrested
half of our customers.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.749
Yeah, we only want
to arrest one more.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.917
Toro Ochoa.
Has he been in here?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.686
We think he's hiding
in the neighborhood.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.555
You heard anything?

16:28.621 --> 16:30.490
We don't know
where he is.
STREET: Come on, ladies.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.525
Guys like Ochoa
give metalheads
a bad name.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.861
I recognize you.
From the news.

16:34.927 --> 16:37.530
You giving the cops
a good name?
I will if I get Ochoa.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.899
* *

16:41.768 --> 16:43.203
All right, mister.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.105
I'm-a tell you something,

16:45.172 --> 16:47.274
and then I want you
the hell out.
I'm all ears.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.676
He brought a girl in, a xe.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.244
They were in
a couple nights ago.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.313
Laurisa. A prostitute.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.514
Works South Fig.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.917
Calling Hondo.
Maybe he can bring
this Laurisa in.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.286
Thanks.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.257
I don't know Toro Ochoa.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.758
Don't even know
how to spell it.

17:08.328 --> 17:11.898
We got witnesses who say that
you're his squeeze, Laurisa.

17:11.964 --> 17:12.999
They're wrong.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.403
Who gave you that artwork
on your neck?

17:16.469 --> 17:17.970
Pretty, isn't it?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.306
You're protecting him?

17:21.208 --> 17:24.144
Ochoa is a paranoid
son of a bitch.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.413
You kill enough people,
the ghosts come out to play.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.084
Laurisa,

17:31.151 --> 17:32.719
I get that you're
scared of him.

17:35.188 --> 17:38.024
But maybe you'd feel better
with him behind bars
for the rest of his life.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.263
DEACON:
No one will ever know
that you spoke to us.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.632
We won't even remember
how to spell your name.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.180
He's got a hideout

18:00.247 --> 18:01.714
a couple blocks from here.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.417
* *

18:13.059 --> 18:15.462
Ochoa's squeeze said they
went into apartment 8B.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.237
HONDO:
Ladies, come this way.
Come this way.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.772
Street, Chris, get 'em out.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.340
Move, move, move, move.
Stop moving.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.841
LAPD. Drop the weapon!

18:28.908 --> 18:30.577
Drop the weapon!
I got a conceal
and carry permit.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.379
Drop the weapon!
Put it down now!

18:32.445 --> 18:34.514
I have a permit. Okay.
LUCA: Drop your weapon. Now.
Clear! Break!

18:34.581 --> 18:36.216
I have a permit.
DEACON: Then you
should know the law.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.717
On your stomach! Stomach!
Okay. Okay.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.419
LUCA: Face down! Down!
All right.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.820
Give me your hands.
You all right?

18:40.887 --> 18:42.889
Yeah, yeah. Tell them to take
it easy, he's my brother.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.358
It's not what it seems.
Ochoa shot at us first,

18:45.425 --> 18:46.826
and then took off, like,
two minutes ago.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.060
You doing business with him?
No.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.429
No.
We're law-abiding citizens.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.963
Then how do you
explain all of this?

18:51.030 --> 18:52.899
Hey, we're all in
this together, man.
We want the same thing.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.067
What's that?
To arrest Toro Ochoa.

19:02.642 --> 19:07.079
So, Scott and Andy Clarke,
out of Medford, Oregon.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.015
Why are you playing cops
in our city?

19:09.081 --> 19:10.283
We got a lead on Ochoa.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.684
Attempted to make
a citizen's arrest.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.720
We're Promise Guards.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.155
We monitor federal websites,
share intel with each other,

19:16.223 --> 19:18.691
use vacation time to hunt
undocumented aliens.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.727
You know, most people come
here to go to Disneyland.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.562
Well, thank God for
the Constitution.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.696
Know what I mean?

19:25.965 --> 19:28.100
You put innocent
lives at risk.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.603
If you knew where Ochoa was,
why didn't you
call the police?

19:30.670 --> 19:33.540
A dangerous guy
like that out there,
we didn't want to wait.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.807
How'd you know
where to find him?

19:34.874 --> 19:37.844
Bunch of us who are in town
had a chat with some L-2Ds

19:37.910 --> 19:39.579
at a housing project
in Van Nuys.

19:39.646 --> 19:42.482
Oh, L2-Ds just offered up the
information, is that right?

19:42.549 --> 19:44.784
Or did this little chat happen
at the end of your guns?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.453
Let's just say
we don't have to deal

19:46.519 --> 19:49.556
with all those
pinko city council rules
that hold you guys back

19:49.622 --> 19:52.124
from doing the job.
It's why the illegals
are taking over.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.594
Do you know that it
costs more for a citizen

19:54.661 --> 19:56.329
to go to college then
it does for an immigrant?

19:56.396 --> 19:57.730
That's not actually true,
Mr. Clarke.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.267
Sure it is. Look it up.
No, it's not.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.502
I mean, I get that
you have to say that.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.637
But it's not
worth arguing about.

20:04.704 --> 20:09.041
The important thing is
Ochoa is still out there,
looking to hurt people.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.510
HONDO: All right,
you know what?

20:10.577 --> 20:12.512
I think we should
work together.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.681
Why don't you guys
keep talking,
and I'll check back?

20:21.053 --> 20:22.389
Your boss?

20:23.055 --> 20:24.190
Yep.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.494
So...
What else you got on Ochoa?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.532
You won't believe
who these guys are.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.567
We need to talk first.
In my office.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.145
What's going on?

20:46.212 --> 20:48.014
Michael knows.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.082
Michael Plank?
Knows what?

20:50.149 --> 20:51.318
He saw us outside my place.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.953
He was watching us?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.788
He was there to check on me
after the article leaked.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.025
He says we've put
the proposals at risk.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.261
And because of us,
he's not gonna
move them forward.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.864
Well, Jess, he's not
gonna let that happen.
His name's on them, too.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.633
What happens now?
Do I quit

21:06.699 --> 21:09.035
Okay, slow down. Slow...
We were naive to think
we could get away with this.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.804
No, no.
We decided it wasn't the
department's business

21:11.871 --> 21:13.573
what we do in
our personal time.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.910
He says I can't be trying
to reform the department

21:17.977 --> 21:20.313
at the same time
as I'm ignoring
a police regulation.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.648
And he's right.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.452
All right, look,
you're not alone in this.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.653
Let me try
and talk to him.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.521
No, I'm the problem here.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.690
It's worth a try.
And say what?

21:30.757 --> 21:32.359
"We knew we were risking
the department's rep,

21:32.425 --> 21:33.826
"but can you look
the other way?"

21:37.229 --> 21:38.698
There's got to be
an answer here.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.333
I just need to
figure out what.

21:40.400 --> 21:44.303
Cortez,
protest outside
is growing.

21:44.371 --> 21:45.938
Captain, I'll keep you
apprised on Ochoa.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.076
Sir.
Hondo.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.412
We need to diffuse it.
Things are getting
out of hand.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.280
Rumor is they want
a rally at Grand Park.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.786
PROTESTERS:
Justice! We belong!

21:59.852 --> 22:02.589
Justice! We belong! Justice!

22:02.655 --> 22:04.491
We belong! Justice!

22:04.557 --> 22:07.059
We belong! Justice! We belong!

22:07.126 --> 22:08.595
Justice! We belong!

22:08.661 --> 22:09.896
Ms. Acosta?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.933
I'm Captain Cortez
with the LAPD.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.435
Can we talk?
What do you want?

22:15.502 --> 22:18.037
They sent a Hispanic woman
out here to shut you up.

22:18.104 --> 22:20.740
I'm here to help.
Are you an immigrant?

22:20.807 --> 22:23.175
Yes. I moved here
when I was 15,

22:23.242 --> 22:24.777
became a citizen
when I was 22.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.579
Then which side are you on?

22:26.646 --> 22:28.748
Yours, hers,

22:28.815 --> 22:29.949
the city's.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.118
What a bunch
of political BS.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.486
Just give me five minutes.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.091
Here.

22:39.158 --> 22:40.827
CROWD:
We belong! Justice!

22:40.893 --> 22:43.262
We belong! Justice! We belong!

22:43.329 --> 22:45.898
All right, listen up.
There's a bunch
of Promise Guards in town.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.801
They've been uploading
surveillance of undocumented
aliens to their website.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.538
Guys we just interviewed
said that they got footage
of Ochoa.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.272
Here's the URL
and the password.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.547
TAN:
Why aren't these guys
in custody?

23:00.613 --> 23:03.115
Well, they didn't do anything
illegal. I spoke to the DA.

23:03.182 --> 23:06.018
Their gun permits checked out.
They didn't disrupt our raid.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.687
So, it's cool
to terrify people
by shooting up

23:07.754 --> 23:09.856
an apartment building, right?
Self-defense, yeah.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.791
And Ochoa and no one else
is gonna press charges.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.493
Probably 'cause
they're all undocumented.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.094
DEACON:
Crime's a crime, Chris.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.830
And a lot of people don't
agree with sanctuary cities.
Do you?

23:17.897 --> 23:20.232
I don't know, I think
it makes our job harder.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.301
Tan?

23:22.368 --> 23:24.604
Got a cousin who enlisted
to get citizenship.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.038
Blown to pieces in Iraq.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.640
System needs to be reformed.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.876
Look, it's a tricky subject,

23:29.942 --> 23:33.045
but we can debate it
later over beers once
we get Ochoa into custody.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.481
TAN: Check it out.
DEACON: All right, so,

23:34.547 --> 23:36.983
Ochoa was at
that housing project
when the ICE raid went down.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.350
Who's he talking
to there?

23:40.920 --> 23:42.088
Where's Street?

23:45.858 --> 23:48.595
Ariana Acosta,
Officer Street.

23:48.661 --> 23:52.164
What's happening outside
isn't helping Carlos or
this department.

23:52.231 --> 23:53.700
We need to calm things down.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.702
To do that,
both sides need to be heard.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.236
You don't want to hear me.

23:57.303 --> 23:59.138
You just want to stop me
from getting people's
attention.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.673
JESSICA:
Try us.

24:00.740 --> 24:03.075
Okay if I step out
while you two talk?

24:06.378 --> 24:07.914
Just...

24:07.980 --> 24:09.315
Listen to each other.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.624
You're a monster.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.793
My brother is
completely innocent.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.862
Easy to have a problem
with a cop until you need one.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.499
Honestly, we were
there to help.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.735
And then, one of ICE's guys
got stabbed,

24:28.801 --> 24:31.804
and then, all of a sudden,
there's all these people
running,

24:31.871 --> 24:34.006
and you don't know who's who.
Am I supposed
to feel sorry for you?

24:35.107 --> 24:36.375
Officer,

24:36.442 --> 24:39.011
my brother is not Toro Ochoa.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.279
He's not a criminal.

24:40.346 --> 24:42.549
Well, he was acting like one.
He ran.

24:42.615 --> 24:45.652
And I arrested him as
peacefully as possible.

24:45.718 --> 24:48.921
And we are just trying
to keep the city safe.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.159
Your turn, I guess.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.496
How could you
possibly understand?

24:57.564 --> 24:58.731
Try me.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.434
Well, to start,
you arrested my hero.

25:02.501 --> 25:07.373
Carlos risked his life
so we could escape the gangs
in El Salvador.

25:07.439 --> 25:09.475
I was 12,
he was 18.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.544
When we got here,

25:11.611 --> 25:16.015
he worked as a day laborer
so he could pay rent, feed us.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.719
He sacrificed for me.

25:19.786 --> 25:22.622
I'm a medical student
at UCLA now.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.423
I'm going to be
a pediatrician.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.458
Impressive.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.027
Because of him.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.598
And he's nothing
like the trash
that is Toro Ochoa.

25:31.664 --> 25:32.865
Are you sure about
that, Ms. Acosta?

25:36.302 --> 25:39.672
That's your brother,
chatting it up
with Toro Ochoa.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.780
What's the deal with this?

25:47.847 --> 25:50.249
Um... I don't know.
HONDO: Okay.

25:50.316 --> 25:51.417
Then we're gonna need
to find out.

25:56.856 --> 25:59.291
HONDO: You told ICE that
you didn't know Toro Ochoa.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.961
I live in the same building
as his crew.
You can't always avoid him.

26:02.028 --> 26:03.763
That don't look
like casual conversation.

26:03.830 --> 26:04.964
I'm not a gang member.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.265
I don't like L-2D's
talking to me,

26:06.332 --> 26:07.734
but it's better
than pissing them off.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.936
STREET: You know
something about Ochoa,
it could help your case.

26:10.002 --> 26:11.804
Why should I help you?
You put me here.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.940
Think about your sister.
She's worried about you,
Carlos.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.675
I am. I'm trying
to protect her!

26:15.742 --> 26:17.109
Your sister
in some kind of trouble?

26:19.045 --> 26:21.681
She's DACA, a Dreamer.

26:21.748 --> 26:24.316
With all the politics,
she could get deported.

26:24.383 --> 26:25.985
What's that got
to do with Ochoa?

26:28.755 --> 26:31.190
About a week ago,
he heard me talking
to someone on the phone

26:31.257 --> 26:33.693
about a place to hide Ariana
if someone ever came for her.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.299
There's an underground...

26:42.101 --> 26:46.105
Members of temples and
congregations that help hide
undocumented workers.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.539
They make their
homes available.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.108
To keep families
together.

26:49.175 --> 26:52.211
There are thousands
of Arianas.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.313
If the feds find out
about the network,

26:54.380 --> 26:56.482
those families won't have
any place to go.

26:56.548 --> 26:58.284
You think Ochoa's
hiding from us
in this underground?

27:02.588 --> 27:05.658
He said someone was after him
and he needed a place
to lay low.

27:05.725 --> 27:07.259
I told him I
wouldn't help.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.364
Two days ago,
someone broke
into my apartment,

27:12.431 --> 27:15.401
went through all my stuff,
stole my cell phone.

27:16.402 --> 27:20.006
In it was Ariana's contact.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.140
He could be there.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.574
What's this contact's name?

27:23.309 --> 27:24.610
Gregory McGahan.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.320
Yes.

27:47.767 --> 27:50.937
Ochoa's inside,
I'm pretty sure he's armed.
McGahan's scared.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.905
HONDO: Move in now.
Keep it quiet.
Keep it contained.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.110
HONDO:
Luca?

27:58.177 --> 27:59.278
Almost there.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.384
Now.

28:15.561 --> 28:17.463
In position.
On my count.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.367
One.

28:22.835 --> 28:23.870
Two.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.107
Three.

28:33.312 --> 28:34.446
Left side clear!

28:36.182 --> 28:37.349
Right side's clear!

28:39.752 --> 28:41.387
Give me two!
Two! Two!

28:43.722 --> 28:45.024
We got you.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.433
Give me your arm.
Give me your other arm.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.667
Relax, Mr. Ochoa.

28:58.204 --> 28:59.839
Save the street poetry
for the feds.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.641
Street, we good?

29:02.708 --> 29:03.742
We're good.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.319
Ochoa's headed
to a deportation
facility.

29:13.385 --> 29:14.887
ICE'll take it
from there.

29:14.954 --> 29:17.323
Sir, is there anything
we can do for Carlos Acosta

29:17.389 --> 29:18.858
since he helped us
catch this guy?

29:18.925 --> 29:20.893
I'll ask. Meantime,
we got another problem.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.829
The protestors moved
to Grand Park.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.997
Inciters on both sides.
It's getting noisy.

29:25.064 --> 29:26.665
Better treat everybody
with kid gloves.

29:26.732 --> 29:28.667
Don't want to end up in front
of the captain's firing squad.

29:28.734 --> 29:31.503
Want to discuss policy in our
free time, I'm happy to do it,

29:31.570 --> 29:33.272
but right now,
focus on the job.

29:33.339 --> 29:34.907
All I want to
do is the job.

29:36.742 --> 29:38.344
Start crowd
control protocol.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.779
Deacon, get the team ready
in case we have to go in.

29:41.713 --> 29:43.049
Hello?

29:43.916 --> 29:45.484
HICKS: Commissioner, good.

29:45.551 --> 29:48.454
Brought him in hoping
he could work something
from the community angle.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.189
I made a few calls.
People are angry.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.723
Feel like the cops betrayed
them on this issue.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.792
It's more complicated
than that.

29:53.860 --> 29:56.662
Sergeant, given Acosta's
arrest, I'm not sure S.W.A.T.
is the best idea here.

29:56.728 --> 29:59.131
If we don't go in,
and things turn bad,

29:59.198 --> 30:01.067
we'll catch the heat
for not showing up.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.534
Maybe.

30:02.601 --> 30:04.070
Captain, what do you think?

30:05.938 --> 30:07.539
I agree with Hondo.

30:07.606 --> 30:09.708
We need to be ready
to go in.

30:09.775 --> 30:13.612
Everyone in Class C uniforms.
Less confrontational.

30:13.679 --> 30:16.248
I'll keep on my contacts,
see what I can do
to calm things down.

30:18.584 --> 30:19.818
Excuse me, sir?

30:21.020 --> 30:23.022
I think we need to talk.

30:23.089 --> 30:25.057
I'm sure we do.

30:25.124 --> 30:26.625
Sergeant,
sorry if you disagree,

30:26.692 --> 30:29.328
but your team's
not the best face
for the department right now.

30:29.395 --> 30:32.932
What exactly do you
know about tactics?
Not much.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.400
But I know a show of force
by the same cops

30:34.466 --> 30:36.402
who caused this outrage
isn't the best option.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.070
Cortez solved that.
For now.

30:38.137 --> 30:40.372
See if she made the right call
when things get more heated.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.174
Is that really where
your head is at?

30:42.241 --> 30:44.210
What?
I'm just trying to figure
out why you're spying

30:44.276 --> 30:46.278
on Captain Cortez and me
in front of her apartment.

30:47.646 --> 30:49.048
Hmm?

30:50.016 --> 30:51.450
What's your deal?

30:56.288 --> 30:57.689
I'm jealous.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.293
The two of you are very lucky.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.433
You're in a line of work

31:07.499 --> 31:10.202
where you know
who the bad guys are
and who the good guys are.

31:11.670 --> 31:15.107
See, in politics, if someone
doesn't like your ideas,

31:15.174 --> 31:16.808
they don't attack them,
they attack you,

31:16.875 --> 31:18.610
smiling at you
the whole time.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.646
That's why you always have
to make the first play,

31:20.712 --> 31:22.081
stay ahead of your foes.

31:22.148 --> 31:25.617
Like you did
with your reform proposals.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.853
Excuse me?
You leaked 'em
to the papers, didn't you?

31:29.021 --> 31:30.356
I had to,

31:30.422 --> 31:32.925
before the rank-and-file
killed the whole thing
internally.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.995
If I had known the two of
you were screwing one another
and the department,

31:36.062 --> 31:37.263
I wouldn't have
wasted my time.

31:37.329 --> 31:38.764
Nobody knows
about us but you.

31:38.830 --> 31:41.100
The more Cortez is out there,
publicly pushing this agenda,

31:41.167 --> 31:43.502
the more people focus on
every detail of her life.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.004
You'll both be exposed.

31:46.505 --> 31:49.175
So, wait. You're
looking out for us?
Not you.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.277
Just Jessica.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.778
She's smart.

31:52.844 --> 31:55.614
She'll go places if she
doesn't get dinged by this.

31:55.681 --> 31:59.051
What hasn't sunken in for her
yet is the double standard.

31:59.118 --> 32:03.822
See, if a man wants to shake
things up, make 'em stick,

32:03.889 --> 32:06.425
he can probably get away
with an intern on her
knees in the White House,

32:06.492 --> 32:08.260
or a tryst with
Russian call girls,

32:09.728 --> 32:11.263
but not a woman.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.900
Jessica can't ignore
department regulations

32:14.967 --> 32:16.535
and sleep with one
of her subordinates

32:16.602 --> 32:18.837
while lecturing other
cops on how to behave.

32:18.904 --> 32:21.007
That's what the
story will be,

32:21.073 --> 32:23.976
not what Jessica's trying
to do for this city.

32:24.043 --> 32:27.379
You're asking me
what my deal is,
Sergeant Harrelson?

32:29.148 --> 32:30.249
What's yours?

32:33.519 --> 32:35.988
Because if you cared
about Jessica at all,

32:37.123 --> 32:38.557
you'd want to protect her.

32:51.737 --> 32:54.373
DEACON: What's
going on, Mr. Clarke?

32:54.440 --> 32:55.941
It's just you and me out here.
What's up?

32:56.008 --> 32:58.477
You see that rally
we're starting up?
Sure.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.412
What about it?
I got to thinking,

33:00.479 --> 33:02.281
after you and I talked.

33:02.348 --> 33:03.882
Thinking about
a lot of stuff.

33:03.949 --> 33:05.384
Yeah

33:05.451 --> 33:06.918
My brother, you know,

33:06.985 --> 33:09.388
Andy and the rest
of those guys
that are in town,

33:09.455 --> 33:10.956
they're against
illegal immigration

33:11.023 --> 33:12.891
like the rest of the
counter-protesters out there.

33:12.958 --> 33:14.493
But they...

33:14.560 --> 33:16.662
They're planning
on taking it too far.

33:18.897 --> 33:21.033
I signed up to bag
criminals, you know?

33:21.100 --> 33:22.901
Illegals, like
we talked about.

33:23.969 --> 33:25.804
But I don't think
she qualifies.

33:26.372 --> 33:27.439
Who?

33:28.907 --> 33:30.276
DEACON: Hondo.

33:30.342 --> 33:31.543
Promise Guards
are at the rally.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.545
They're targeting
Acosta's sister, Ariana.

33:33.612 --> 33:36.215
Wait, what?
Clarke said that they want
to make an example out of her.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.284
Take her to the border
and throw her
on the other side.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.851
TAN: The border?
Tan, pull up their website.

33:39.918 --> 33:41.920
Get photos of these guys.
Why this girl?

33:41.987 --> 33:43.422
She's a name now.
She's been on TV.

33:43.489 --> 33:45.091
She represents a lot
to a lot of people.

33:45.157 --> 33:48.127
Right now, she needs our
help. Remember these faces.

33:48.194 --> 33:50.296
They're our targets.
Let's move.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.802
ORGANIZER:
We belong here!
We belong! Justice!

33:56.868 --> 33:59.004
Justice for Carlos Acosta!

34:00.306 --> 34:01.973
We want justice!

34:02.040 --> 34:03.442
His sister, Ariana Acosta.

34:03.509 --> 34:06.145
Please, welcome her.

34:16.422 --> 34:20.192
PROTESTERS:
We belong! Justice! We belong!

34:20.259 --> 34:21.993
ARIANA:
My brother didn't hurt anyone.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.330
He shouldn't have
been arrested.

34:24.396 --> 34:27.499
And as an upstanding member
of this community,

34:27.566 --> 34:30.369
he has rights. He has a voice.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.671
Let the police
and the feds know

34:32.738 --> 34:34.506
that what they've done
is wrong.

34:34.573 --> 34:38.444
Carlos doesn't deserve
to be deported!
This is his home!

34:38.510 --> 34:39.811
Park bench, 12 o'clock.

34:39.878 --> 34:42.047
My home! Your home!

34:42.114 --> 34:44.082
Chris, Rocker, go left.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.118
Deacon, Mumford,
take the boys and go right.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.154
Tell the feds and police
they're wrong!

34:48.220 --> 34:50.522
Look, this fight
isn't just for Carlos.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.691
This fight is
for all of us.

34:52.758 --> 34:55.827
We all have a voice!
We all belong here!

34:55.894 --> 34:58.364
Three o'clock
and they're armed.
STREET: All of 'em.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.698
The hell you think
you're doing,

34:59.765 --> 35:01.066
showing your face around here?
Step aside.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.104
STREET: Let us do our jobs.
Come on.

35:06.172 --> 35:08.574
Hey, man. You heard
what he said.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.442
We're taking you back
to the border, bitch.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.252
We lost her.
Anyone have eyes?

35:24.223 --> 35:25.691
DEACON: They're headed
towards a blue pickup.

35:25.757 --> 35:27.193
South side of the park.
HONDO: Let 'em go.

35:27.259 --> 35:28.794
Away from the crowd.
Copy.

35:28.860 --> 35:29.861
We need breathing
room, Deac.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.431
DEACON:
Two more suspects.

35:33.632 --> 35:34.933
Hey!

35:39.571 --> 35:41.240
STREET: Stay back!
CHRIS: Stay back!

35:41.307 --> 35:43.041
LUCA:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
STREET: Stay back!

35:43.108 --> 35:44.510
LUCA:
Back, back, back!

35:44.576 --> 35:45.577
CHRIS: Stay back!

35:45.644 --> 35:48.314
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:53.151 --> 35:54.220
LUCA: It's okay.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.987
Stay back! Back! Back!

35:56.054 --> 35:57.889
CHRIS: Stay back!
Hey, hey, hey.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.825
Take it easy!

35:59.891 --> 36:01.693
Take it easy and stay calm!

36:01.760 --> 36:03.929
Listen to me, we hear you!

36:03.995 --> 36:05.631
You have the right
to protest!

36:05.697 --> 36:07.833
But you will be arrested
if you don't step back!

36:07.899 --> 36:09.468
We're directing
you to disperse!

36:09.535 --> 36:10.869
We want to keep everyone safe!

36:10.936 --> 36:12.003
Give us some room!

36:12.070 --> 36:13.972
Please!
HONDO: Step back!

36:15.241 --> 36:16.775
Step back now!

36:25.717 --> 36:27.052
You all right?

36:27.118 --> 36:28.787
Yeah, I think so. Thank you.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.777
How's the team?
They're good.

36:51.843 --> 36:54.580
Tired, but they're good.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.316
I called Agent Jones
to follow up on Carlos Acosta.

36:57.383 --> 36:59.251
See if we can stop
his deportation.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.119
Well, the fact
that he helped us
take down a killer

37:01.186 --> 37:02.254
should mean something.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.422
We'll hear soon.

37:07.359 --> 37:08.427
I hate this.

37:09.661 --> 37:10.962
Yeah, I know.

37:12.598 --> 37:14.566
But I think maybe we both know
what the deal is.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.805
Jess, after everything we just
went through at that rally,

37:19.871 --> 37:21.673
there's still a long way to go
to improve relations

37:21.740 --> 37:23.008
between the cops
and the community.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.778
And you have an opportunity
to change things.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.848
I can't turn my back on that.

37:29.915 --> 37:31.950
No, you can't.

37:32.017 --> 37:34.686
You need the space
to do the great things
that I know you're gonna do.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.355
Hondo...
Jess, come on now.

37:37.222 --> 37:39.124
Right now,

37:39.190 --> 37:40.592
I'm in the way.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.095
The timing isn't right.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.132
You got to do you.

37:47.198 --> 37:48.867
And you can't do that with me.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.940
Maybe down the road
it could be right?

37:58.877 --> 38:00.045
I believe that.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.214
Yeah, maybe.

38:10.356 --> 38:11.657
I never said it before, but...

38:15.961 --> 38:17.429
I love you.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.537
I love you, too.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.610
Okay.

38:42.654 --> 38:43.955
Hello?

39:14.953 --> 39:16.254
I know this is difficult

39:16.321 --> 39:17.989
and I don't want you
to lose hope,

39:18.056 --> 39:21.893
but your brother
has been transferred by ICE
to an Arizona facility.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.762
They're moving ahead
on deporting him.

39:23.829 --> 39:24.863
Okay, so what
do we do now?

39:26.264 --> 39:27.533
It's out of our hands.

39:27.599 --> 39:30.101
What, so we
just give up?

39:30.168 --> 39:33.539
I appreciate you for trying,
Captain Cortez.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.641
But I'm going
to bring him home,

39:35.707 --> 39:37.142
with or without your help.

39:41.547 --> 39:42.848
Ms. Acosta?

39:44.516 --> 39:45.851
Ariana?

39:45.917 --> 39:47.185
Wait.

39:47.252 --> 39:49.120
Look, you don't have
to worry about me anymore.

39:49.187 --> 39:51.089
No, it's because of me he's
headed back to El Salvador,
right?

39:51.156 --> 39:53.625
You were doing your job.
You didn't know who
Carlos was.

39:53.692 --> 39:56.762
Well, you tried to tell me.
I mean, you were yelling.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.764
But you tried.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.500
Please. Please. I'm sorry.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.736
I'm sorry for my part in this.

40:05.837 --> 40:07.673
I hope you get him back.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.307
And I want to try to help you.

40:10.876 --> 40:13.344
I, um, have this.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.449
This is the number
for an immigration attorney.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.585
He's supposed to be great.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.186
Does pro bono work.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.421
And, uh,
that's my number.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.958
If you need something,

40:27.025 --> 40:29.895
anything, please call.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.030
Okay.

40:32.097 --> 40:33.298
Thank you.

40:49.314 --> 40:50.582
Come in.

40:58.724 --> 41:01.860
It's done. We broke up.

41:01.927 --> 41:05.196
As far as anyone else
is concerned,
it never happened.

41:05.263 --> 41:07.265
We can move forward
with the proposals.

41:10.602 --> 41:11.970
Two of you can hold to that?

41:12.037 --> 41:16.107
Michael, my priority is to
this department, to this city.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.143
Anything else
would be selfish.

41:24.783 --> 41:25.817
You all right?

41:28.253 --> 41:29.420
I'm good.

41:46.471 --> 41:49.140
Another S.W.A.T. day
is a good day!

41:49.207 --> 41:50.742
Let's make it count!

41:50.809 --> 41:52.544
It's too early for
the enthusiasm, Luca.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.312
Yo, man up, Tan.

41:54.379 --> 41:55.914
Street, you ready?

41:55.981 --> 41:57.515
Yeah, let's do it.

42:00.586 --> 42:02.320
Everything all right today,
boss?

42:02.387 --> 42:04.222
Yeah.

42:04.923 --> 42:06.424
Oh, yeah. I'm great.
