WEBVTT

00:12.096 --> 00:14.682
[opening credit music]

00:32.783 --> 00:35.077
[Niffty]
So, like, where are your wings?

00:35.077 --> 00:36.537
Niffty, I don't have--

00:36.537 --> 00:38.289
[Angel] Did you ever think maybe
she's sensitive

00:38.289 --> 00:39.457
about her lack
of wings,

00:39.457 --> 00:41.208
just like her lack of tits?

00:41.500 --> 00:43.627
Yeah. Where are your tits?

00:43.627 --> 00:45.588
[sighs]
Any other questions?

00:45.588 --> 00:47.256
[Husk]
I got one.

00:47.256 --> 00:49.258
How come every time
Charlie talks to Heaven

00:49.258 --> 00:51.385
we get in
deeper and deeper shit?

00:51.385 --> 00:53.179
[Vaggie]
It's not her fault.

00:53.179 --> 00:54.430
Angels are just--

00:54.430 --> 00:55.848
-Liars?
-[Vaggie] ...difficult

00:55.848 --> 00:57.767
But Charlie's trying her best.

00:57.767 --> 01:02.480
[Husk] Yeah, well, her best
is turning out real well so far.

01:02.480 --> 01:05.858
[Angel] And where is
miss fearless leader anyway?

01:05.858 --> 01:09.487
Isn't it about time for
another "doomed-to-fail" plan?

01:09.487 --> 01:10.780
She's upstairs.

01:10.780 --> 01:12.782
Coming up with
something, I'm sure,

01:13.741 --> 01:14.784
in our room.

01:15.743 --> 01:16.827
-[Vaggie] Alone.
- [sinister music]

01:16.827 --> 01:19.330
[Alastor] Hmm.

01:19.789 --> 01:23.667
[melancholy music]
[Charlies cries softly]

01:25.127 --> 01:29.256
Oh, Charlie,
you look an absolute mess.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.218
Ugh, go away, Alastor.

01:32.218 --> 01:36.639
Now, now, is that any way to act
after picking a fight with all of Heaven and

01:36.639 --> 01:38.557
and dooming
everyone you love?

01:39.308 --> 01:40.893
I have enough on my mind

01:40.893 --> 01:44.313
without hearing your sadistic
idea of a joke, asshole.

01:44.729 --> 01:45.898
[Alastor] Who's joking?
[Charlie jumps]

01:45.898 --> 01:47.650
[Charlie] Aaagh!

01:47.650 --> 01:49.819
You have a captive audience
downstairs waiting to hear

01:49.819 --> 01:52.696
what kind of inspiring
performance you have planned next.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.615
Ugh, I can't.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.618
How can I face them
after failing them all so hard?

01:57.827 --> 02:01.831
They came here to be saved and
all I gave them was more pain.

02:03.165 --> 02:06.794
I'm just as bad as
the cruelest Overlord in Hell.

02:07.336 --> 02:08.711
And maybe worse.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.798
At least they don't go
around giving false hope.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.759
Well, I never expected to
see such a miserable display

02:13.759 --> 02:15.594
of self-loathing from you.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.763
Oh, fuck you, Alastor.

02:17.763 --> 02:21.851
All you do is stand there,
smiling while you watch us struggle and fail.

02:21.851 --> 02:25.228
I don't know how you can enjoy
all this suffering so much.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.605
[Alastor chuckles]

02:26.605 --> 02:28.357
Just because you see a smile,

02:28.357 --> 02:31.360
don't think you know
what's going on underneath.

02:31.694 --> 02:35.281
A smile is
a valuable tool, my dear.

02:35.281 --> 02:38.367
It inspires your friends,
keeps your enemies guessing,

02:38.367 --> 02:43.204
and ensures that no matter what
comes your way, you're the one in control.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.415
But I'm not.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.333
I'm the farthest
thing from in control.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.378
The person I trust most
has been lying to me for years.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.213
Heaven refuses to listen.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.799
Even if they did,
I can't prove the hotel works.

02:53.799 --> 02:57.553
Adam has an invincible
exorcist Army pointed right at my doorstep

02:57.553 --> 02:58.637
and there's nothing I can do
[thuds]

02:58.637 --> 02:59.847
[shouts] about any of it.

03:00.431 --> 03:02.224
[sinister music]

03:02.224 --> 03:06.562
[sing-songy] I know
something you don't know .

03:06.562 --> 03:08.731
[Charlie] Huh?

03:08.731 --> 03:11.400
Those big, scary angels are not
quite as indestructible as they seem.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.776
What are you talking about?

03:12.776 --> 03:14.987
Just that you and
your little band of misfits

03:14.987 --> 03:18.365
might stand more of a chance
than you think.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.200
[desperately]
How? I'll do anything.

03:20.492 --> 03:21.660
Anything?

03:22.244 --> 03:24.579
Then... let's make a deal.

03:24.579 --> 03:25.915
You...
[pensive music]

03:25.915 --> 03:28.292
You want my soul?

03:28.292 --> 03:30.753
[sinisterly]
Your soul?

03:30.753 --> 03:32.463
[brightly]
Heavens, no.

03:32.671 --> 03:36.258
All I need from you
is one itty bitty favor.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.469
What's a favor between friends?

03:38.469 --> 03:40.596
I won't hurt anyone for you.

03:40.596 --> 03:43.891
Who's asking! One favor,
at a time of my choosing,

03:43.891 --> 03:45.309
here you harm no one.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.770
In return,
I tell you what I know.

03:47.770 --> 03:48.978
Do we have a deal?

03:48.978 --> 03:50.648
[growling]

03:50.648 --> 03:51.607
[Charlie] Deal.

03:52.524 --> 03:56.403
[ominous music]

03:57.029 --> 03:58.614
[Vaggie] No. No!
[tense music]

03:58.614 --> 03:59.656
[door slams open]
[Vaggie strains]

04:00.282 --> 04:01.575
[Alastor] Right on cue!

04:01.575 --> 04:03.535
[Vaggie] What did
you do? Let her go!

04:03.535 --> 04:05.287
-Vaggie, Stop!
-What?

04:05.287 --> 04:06.622
[spear clinks on the ground]

04:06.622 --> 04:09.291
No, Charlie,
please tell me you didn't--

04:09.291 --> 04:10.834
[oppressive music]
I made a deal with Alastor.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.002
[pleads]
Charlie.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.337
[Alastor]
Oh, calm down.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.506
She still owns her soul.

04:15.506 --> 04:18.425
He gave me info that can save
the hotel, but we're going to need help.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.971
The angels can be defeated,
and Carmilla is the key.

04:21.971 --> 04:23.472
What? Carmilla Carmine?

04:23.764 --> 04:25.975
She killed an exorcist
in the last extermination.

04:25.975 --> 04:27.893
She knows how
they can be harmed.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.395
But...
[tense edgy music]

04:29.395 --> 04:30.938
I-- I didn't even
know that was possible.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.773
[Charlie] If you did,
would you have told me?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.692
Charlie, I--

04:35.317 --> 04:37.987
I need you to go to her,
convince her to teach us.

04:37.987 --> 04:40.322
[gentle music] If
she can, we might have a chance.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.865
With just the seven of us?

04:41.865 --> 04:43.409
No, we're--

04:43.409 --> 04:44.909
ugh, we're going to
need numbers too.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.371
And I know just who can help.

04:47.371 --> 04:51.000
As long as Charlie can be her
normal, charming self.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.669
What's that you said
about smiles?

04:53.669 --> 04:55.004
[Alastor] Good girl.

04:55.004 --> 04:56.672
[quietly] Charlie,
can we talk about this--

04:56.672 --> 04:58.632
[Charlie]
We can talk later. Right now,

04:58.632 --> 04:59.883
we have a job to do.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.344
-You with us?
-[Vaggie sighs]

05:02.594 --> 05:04.013
Ugh.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.681
[grim music]

05:05.681 --> 05:09.018
[Angel] So, uh,
Alastor and Charlie just left

05:09.018 --> 05:10.936
like they were runnin' away
from their responsibilities.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.521
Should
we be alarmed?

05:12.521 --> 05:13.564
[Vaggie] No.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.107
We have a plan,

05:15.107 --> 05:17.484
but it includes defending
ourselves against the angels.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.445
Uh!
Are you fucking high?

05:19.445 --> 05:21.447
-They can be killed--
-[Egg Boi Frank] Yeah.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.907
That knife lady,
Camaro Carfight, killed one!

05:23.907 --> 05:25.492
[Vaggie] Wait.
You knew about this?

05:25.492 --> 05:26.827
Oh, yeah.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.954
I told Boss about it months ago.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.706
He what?

05:30.706 --> 05:32.875
[Sir Pentious] What? They say
insane shit all the time.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.044
How was I supposed to know
this one was true?

05:35.044 --> 05:38.881
Bank accounts are a scam created
by the shadow government.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.924
-See!
-[Vaggie sighs]

05:40.924 --> 05:43.552
What's important now is
that we're gonna have a fight on our hands.

05:44.053 --> 05:47.389
Look, this hotel's about to become
the most dangerous place in Hell, and we--

05:48.682 --> 05:51.643
I... can't
guarantee your safety anymore.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.937
[foreboding music] I still
believe in Charlie's dream.

05:53.937 --> 05:57.941
I know this place can work...
but none of you signed up for this.

05:59.485 --> 06:01.070
I'm going to go
learn how we can fight back.

06:01.070 --> 06:02.071
But when I come home...

06:03.072 --> 06:05.074
Well I'll understand.
if none of you are here.

06:05.074 --> 06:06.533
[Angel sighs heavily]

06:06.533 --> 06:09.078
[Sir Pentious]
Well, this is awkward.

06:09.078 --> 06:10.329
[Niffty] 'Kay!

06:10.746 --> 06:12.122
[Charlie]
Three years.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.166
Three years I've been
sharing my life with her.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.085
And I tell her everything.

06:16.085 --> 06:19.421
My hopes, my dreams,
my insecurities, my embarrassing habits.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.465
What fucking deodorant I like.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.093
And she keeps
something like this from me .

06:24.510 --> 06:26.595
Why would she lie for so long?
Does she think I wouldn't accept her?

06:26.595 --> 06:29.389
What about me, ME, says un
understanding...

06:30.015 --> 06:31.975
misunderstanding?

06:31.975 --> 06:34.520
Disunder-- Wait, w-where are we?

06:34.520 --> 06:36.021
[Alistor]
Cannibal Town!

06:36.021 --> 06:38.148
There's a friend of mine
I think you should meet.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.942
In Cannibal Town? But it's--

06:39.942 --> 06:42.111
It's... surprisingly nice here.

06:42.111 --> 06:43.737
Isn't it, though?

06:43.737 --> 06:47.032
And it's all thanks
to a very special someone.

06:47.032 --> 06:50.953
[Rosie] Well, who hasn't
thought about eating their first husband?

06:50.953 --> 06:53.831
I certainly would have
if he didn't taste so bad!

06:53.831 --> 06:54.873
Haha!

06:54.873 --> 06:56.457
I tell you what.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.752
You bring old, tall,
dark and armless to me,

06:58.752 --> 07:02.756
and I'll straighten them right out,
okay sweetie? Now here's my card and--

07:03.674 --> 07:07.970
[gleefully] Oh
my stars. Do my eyes deceive me?

07:08.637 --> 07:10.806
Alastor? Alastor!

07:10.806 --> 07:13.058
Where have you been?

07:13.058 --> 07:16.770
These halls really lost some of
their sparkle without your lively presence and--

07:17.146 --> 07:19.565
Oh. Who's this
you brought with you?

07:19.565 --> 07:22.818
Come now, Alastor,
She's much too young for you.

07:22.818 --> 07:24.695
Oh, I'm just kidding.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.238
-I know you're an ace in the hole.
-[Alastor] A what now?

07:26.238 --> 07:28.448
[Rosie] But where
are your manners Mister?

07:28.907 --> 07:30.617
[light music]
Introduce us, why don't you?

07:30.617 --> 07:34.163
[Alastor]
Ah, yes, Charlie. This is Rosie.

07:34.163 --> 07:37.624
The most darling, delightful,
and dangerous Overlord

07:37.624 --> 07:38.876
this side of the pentagram.

07:38.876 --> 07:41.628
Oh, always such a charmer.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.714
And, Rosie,

07:43.714 --> 07:46.008
It's my pleasure to introduce
you to Princess Charlie Morningstar,

07:46.008 --> 07:49.011
daughter of Lucifer
and heir to the throne of Hell.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.680
How do you do?
[laughs awkwardly]

07:51.680 --> 07:55.767
Well, well,
isn't this a regal surprise?

07:55.767 --> 07:57.060
Come in, come in.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.770
Can I offer
you something to eat?

07:58.770 --> 08:01.190
I'm sure I have a leg
around here or something.

08:01.190 --> 08:03.525
Oh, what am I thinking?
Small thing, like you.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.777
You're probably
watching your figure.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.863
How about some nice
pinky fingers instead? Oh.

08:07.863 --> 08:11.867
Ummmm, no, no. Thank you,
though. [laughs awkwardly]

08:11.867 --> 08:14.536
Oh, look at you, so polite!

08:14.536 --> 08:16.121
Alastor, you could
learn a thing or two.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.081
Well, sit down. Sit down.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.209
Tell Auntie Rosie
what she can do for you.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.628
You know, Alastor,
I got a primo connect on a guy

08:22.628 --> 08:25.172
with about eight blocks of
territory and not enough goons to run it.

08:25.672 --> 08:29.218
Prime pickings for a deal
to be made, my friend.

08:29.218 --> 08:32.888
I appreciate the offer,
but we're here on business of another kind.

08:33.222 --> 08:35.140
Well, don't keep me in suspense.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.767
I'm a very busy woman.

08:36.767 --> 08:39.061
[Charlie] Well, as you know,

08:39.937 --> 08:41.813
[frantically] the extermination
is coming early.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.565
It'll be here in a month.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.234
And they're coming for
my hotel and my friends first.

08:45.234 --> 08:47.903
-and I, I, I, I, I, I--
-[Alastor] We need your help.

08:48.278 --> 08:51.865
Well, your cannibals' help
at least, to fend off the attack.

08:51.865 --> 08:56.161
Wow! When you ask a favor,
you don't start small, do you, Your Highness?

08:56.161 --> 08:58.247
Oh, now, don't fret.

08:58.247 --> 09:01.583
I didn't say I wouldn't help,
but I assume there's

09:01.583 --> 09:04.711
more to this plan than
a bunch of unarmed cannibals.

09:04.711 --> 09:08.674
Oh, your people will be far from
helpless when we're done with them.

09:08.674 --> 09:12.010
And by the end,
they will be able to eat

09:12.010 --> 09:14.263
[menacingly]
their fill!

09:14.263 --> 09:17.849
[light music] Well,
in that case, sure. Why not?

09:17.849 --> 09:19.851
-Really?
-What can I say?

09:19.851 --> 09:21.311
I like your moxie, girl.

09:21.311 --> 09:25.065
And old Alastor has
never done me wrong before.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.818
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

09:27.818 --> 09:28.777
-[struggles]
-[banging]

09:28.777 --> 09:30.696
[shouts]
Carmine!

09:30.696 --> 09:32.739
Carmine, we need to speak.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.784
I know what you did
on extermination day.

09:36.618 --> 09:40.122
We can talk about it inside,
or I can yell about it out here.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.873
[door clanks open]

09:41.873 --> 09:43.750
Fuckin' right you open
that door. [door slams shut]

09:43.750 --> 09:45.085
-[eerie music]
-[Vaggie] Hello?

09:45.085 --> 09:46.628
[Carmilla's voice echoes]
You have 2 minutes

09:46.628 --> 09:49.381
to convince me
not to silence you for good.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.133
[dramatic music]

09:51.133 --> 09:53.260
Miss Carmine, I'm here on
appointment from the princess

09:53.260 --> 09:56.930
to enlist your aid in the defense
of Hell from the angelic extermination.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.933
We know an angel fell at your
hands and we need to know how.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.893
-[Carmilla] No!
-What do you mean, no?

10:01.893 --> 10:04.813
-The princess of Hell--
-[Carmilla] Means nothing to me.

10:05.022 --> 10:08.734
You have to do better than that.
90 seconds.

10:08.734 --> 10:11.778
[Vaggie] With your knowledge,
we wouldn't have to helplessly stand by while--

10:11.778 --> 10:14.156
[Carmilla] Clearly I am
not the helpless one here.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.824
80 seconds.

10:15.824 --> 10:16.992
[tense music]
Well, then why?

10:17.200 --> 10:19.328
Why wouldn't you use
what you know to fight?

10:19.328 --> 10:23.165
To avoid the very problem you and
your little friends are facing right now.

10:23.665 --> 10:28.003
I will not invite destruction
into my house, on my people.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.255
[Vaggie]
You think we asked for this?

10:30.255 --> 10:33.216
All Charlie has ever done is try to
make things better to help her people who,

10:33.216 --> 10:35.802
news flash,
include your people too.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.180
And how exactly has that
worked out for her?

10:38.847 --> 10:40.349
[music crescendos]
45 seconds.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.976
We didn't pick the fight,
but it's here now.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.895
And they aren't
going to stop with us.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.813
You didn't see
the look on their leader's face.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.774
With us out of the way,

10:48.774 --> 10:50.192
it's only a matter of time
before they come for the rest of you.

10:50.901 --> 10:53.195
They won't stop
until all of Hell is wiped out,

10:53.195 --> 10:55.697
so you can help us
make a stand here together,

10:55.697 --> 10:57.282
or you can stand alone tomorrow.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.284
And what do you think
your chances will be then?

10:59.284 --> 11:00.869
[Carmilla] You're out of time.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.829
[grunts]
[blade sings]

11:02.829 --> 11:04.831
[rousing fight music]

11:04.831 --> 11:08.293
Angels attack quickly,
viciously, and without mercy.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.379
You'll need to defend
better than that. [sombre music]

11:10.379 --> 11:12.714
[Rosie through megaphone]
Cannibals and Cannibettes,

11:12.714 --> 11:14.132
assemble in the square.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.718
Now, darling,
you know I would do anything,

11:16.718 --> 11:19.304
anything for my clients,

11:19.304 --> 11:21.056
but I can't exactly command

11:21.056 --> 11:23.892
all of Cannibal Town to
follow someone else into battle.

11:23.892 --> 11:24.976
Now, don't get me wrong,

11:24.976 --> 11:26.853
they love carnage and bloodshed,

11:26.853 --> 11:29.731
but to get this group into line,
you got to win 'em over.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.066
[through megaphone]
Settle in!

11:31.066 --> 11:32.943
Settle in! Important meeting.
-[crowd murmurs]

11:32.943 --> 11:36.446
-[Charlie] But how do I--
-With sparkle! Razzmatazz

11:36.446 --> 11:39.950
[light music] and that oh
so appealing moxie of yours.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.743
Shouldn't be a problem.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.079
It's not like you've ever failed
to inspire before.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.747
[Charlie groans]

11:45.747 --> 11:46.998
Now, fair warning.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.209
This group sticks together.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.045
So in order to convince any of
them, you'll need to convince all of them.

11:52.254 --> 11:54.756
And there's one in particular--

11:54.756 --> 11:56.758
[Alastor] Uuuugh, Susan.
-[Rosie] Susan,

11:56.758 --> 11:59.010
who's a bit of an... uh--

11:59.010 --> 12:01.012
-[Alastor] Ornery old bitch?
-[Rosie] That!

12:01.012 --> 12:05.100
She's tough, but win
her over and the rest will be easy as pie.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.102
-Ready?
-I guess.

12:07.102 --> 12:14.776
Everyone we have a very special,
very royal guest this evening!

12:14.776 --> 12:18.071
Please put
your bloody hands together for

12:18.071 --> 12:20.365
Princess Charlie!

12:20.365 --> 12:23.285
[shouting from crowd]
Booooo! Bring Rosie back!

12:23.285 --> 12:24.119
Susan?

12:24.119 --> 12:25.370
[both] Susan.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.247
[P.A system feeds

12:27.247 --> 12:30.000
[laughs nervously]
Sorry. Uh, okay,

12:30.000 --> 12:31.960
-uh, my name's Charlie, and...
-[Susan heckles] Booooo!

12:31.960 --> 12:34.129
-Well, I run this hotel with my part...
-Get off the stage

12:34.129 --> 12:35.839
-you blue blood bitch!
-...well someone and...

12:35.839 --> 12:37.215
-Booo!
-Wait, let me start over.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.342
-We don't give a shit about some
hotel.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.011
Angels are coming to kill us all
and we need help defending our realm.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.262
-leave before I eat those big
ass eyes of yours.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.555
So-- we, uh... we need
your help--

12:43.555 --> 12:45.307
-[Susan still heckling]
Boo! Get off.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.434
[Charlie] With your assistance,
we can make a stand for--

12:47.434 --> 12:49.352
[Susan] Where's the showmanship?
-[Charlie sings] I...I have a dream...

12:49.352 --> 12:51.480
-Where's all the finesse? Fuckin mediocre!
-[Charlie] and I--

12:51.480 --> 12:53.356
[Charlie screams]
Fuck You! You old bitch!

12:53.356 --> 12:54.316
[cannibal crowd gasp]

12:54.316 --> 12:56.193
[Rosie] Okay!

12:56.193 --> 12:58.987
we'll be back after
a brief intermission.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.323
[dramatic fight music]

13:02.449 --> 13:04.075
[Vaggie strains]

13:04.075 --> 13:05.494
[spear slashes]

13:05.494 --> 13:08.121
[Vaggie] Fuck!
Ow!

13:09.414 --> 13:11.958
[thuds]
Aaagh!

13:11.958 --> 13:13.335
Come on,
what is this?

13:13.335 --> 13:15.504
You want me to teach
you how to beat angels?

13:15.504 --> 13:17.881
That's what I'm doing.

13:17.881 --> 13:20.592
By beating the shit out of me?
I'm not used to fighting with long hair.

13:20.592 --> 13:24.262
[Carmilla] By showing
you the flaws in your own fighting style.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.431
Yours and all your sisters'.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.892
Wait...
you know I'm an exorcist?

13:29.267 --> 13:32.020
-How?
-You have a giant X over your eye

13:32.020 --> 13:33.855
and wield an angelic spear.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.899
It's not rocket science.

13:35.899 --> 13:40.445
Before you found out about me,
did you know angels could be harmed?

13:40.445 --> 13:42.531
No.
[dramatic music]

13:43.490 --> 13:45.158
That shows in how you fight.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.577
You leave yourself
open with every swing.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.247
You fight like
someone unafraid of harm,

13:50.247 --> 13:53.375
and this is what
you'll take advantage of.

13:53.375 --> 13:59.047
Angels wield no shields,
little armor and fight with reckless abandon.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.259
-Strike them here, here, and here.
-Argh.

14:02.884 --> 14:03.969
With what?

14:03.969 --> 14:05.470
Some secret weapon of yours?

14:05.470 --> 14:07.639
Stupid girl,
are you really so dense

14:07.639 --> 14:10.392
you don't realize
you're holding the answer?

14:10.392 --> 14:13.061
Angelic weapons?
It's that simple?

14:13.061 --> 14:14.437
[huffs] How has no
one else figured this out?

14:14.437 --> 14:16.940
Angelic steel isn't common,

14:16.940 --> 14:21.236
and those who have it aren't exactly
rushing off to test it against exorcists.

14:21.236 --> 14:24.531
[Carmilla] When my daughters and
I were cornered in that last extermination

14:25.073 --> 14:27.867
I tried to buy time for
my girls to flee, and well...

14:28.535 --> 14:33.123

arms dealer without arming yourself first.

you so out of sorts, darlin'?

Just... angry...

16:32.325 --> 16:34.536
because we share everything!

16:35.036 --> 16:37.664
Because she always supported me,
and my ideas,

16:37.664 --> 16:41.376

or not that was just more of the lies...

-Yes.

that she loves you in return?

17:00.812 --> 17:03.106
Well, then what's the problem?

17:03.106 --> 17:07.068
She took part in the very thing
we've been working so hard to end.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.069
Well...

17:09.237 --> 17:12.240
Isn't that silly hotel
of yours all about redemption?

17:12.240 --> 17:13.742
...Yes?

17:13.742 --> 17:16.744
Perhaps this girl was
trying to redeem herself too?

17:16.744 --> 17:19.580
She knows better than
anyone that I believe in second chances.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.415
Why not tell me?

17:21.415 --> 17:24.002
It can be difficult to admit
to things you're not proud of,

17:24.502 --> 17:27.297
especially if those things hurt
the ones you love.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.257

17:40.727 --> 17:42.771
they speak the truth.

17:42.771 --> 17:45.148

17:45.607 --> 17:48.777
That she believes in me
and what we're doing.

17:48.777 --> 17:52.614
Right now she's off learning how
to protect everything we've worked for...

17:53.281 --> 17:55.658

pitch my hotel right.

17:55.658 --> 17:58.119
