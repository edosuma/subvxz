TARA (NARRATING): Previously on

00:03.200 --> 00:05.040
"Dance Academy." -Cut.

00:05.080 --> 00:06.320
Print.

00:06.360 --> 00:10.400
-Everybody, that is a wrap
on Katrina Karamakov.

00:10.439 --> 00:12.400
-Ollie, are you here
to network?

00:12.439 --> 00:14.080
Or are you here 'cause you
want to hang out with me?

00:14.119 --> 00:15.439
-Well, this is my career.

00:15.480 --> 00:16.480
It's pretty important.

00:16.519 --> 00:18.399
-Marcus, you put a ring on it.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.600
And are you all planning
on moving to Texas?

00:23.320 --> 00:24.480
-Ignore me.

00:24.519 --> 00:25.839
-Zero impact, again.

00:25.879 --> 00:27.600
-And then when your back
improves, you'll do the solo I

00:27.640 --> 00:28.559
selected for you.

00:28.600 --> 00:29.640
-I won't, Miss Raine.

00:29.679 --> 00:30.440
I'm going to keep working
with Saskia.

00:30.480 --> 00:31.640
I'm learning a lot from her.

00:31.679 --> 00:33.479
-Game on, Tara Webster--

00:33.520 --> 00:35.560
game on.

[theme music]

01:25.239 --> 01:27.239
TARA (NARRATING): It's hard to
comprehend tomorrow night I'll

01:27.280 --> 01:31.120
be auditioning for the National
Ballet company, the

01:31.159 --> 01:35.840
final time we dance as students,
the culmination of

01:35.879 --> 01:38.200
the past three years.

01:38.239 --> 01:39.040
-Careful.

01:39.079 --> 01:40.280
Don't oversell it.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.200
-Do I get a special clover?

01:47.239 --> 01:48.799
I don't have a company
audition, but

01:48.840 --> 01:51.599
it is my world premiere.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.519
What if the movie sucks?

01:53.560 --> 01:58.319
What if I suck and people throw
things, sharp things?

01:58.359 --> 02:00.640
-Everyone gets a clover,
even Grace.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.239
I'm making it my mission
to end the year

02:02.280 --> 02:04.359
on a positive not.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.599
And not just to get my karma
points up so the universe

02:06.640 --> 02:08.318
rewards me with a contract.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.840
That would make me--

02:10.878 --> 02:14.080
-You're a cold, ruthless
warrior.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.280
These people think they've
sucked you of

02:15.319 --> 02:17.639
your competitive marrow.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.560
Prove them wrong.

02:19.599 --> 02:23.120
Take him down.

02:23.159 --> 02:25.120
[ballet music playing]

02:31.520 --> 02:33.479
-Could the company
take both of us?

02:33.520 --> 02:35.400
He still deserves it
more than I do.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.800
-His prince is dreamier
than mine.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.560
Is that a gay thought or
a jealous thought?

02:46.639 --> 02:50.599
Jealous thought, definitely.

02:50.639 --> 02:53.680
-He's a fraud, a mere blow-in.

02:53.719 --> 02:54.840
Sheesh.

02:54.879 --> 02:56.560
Stop being polite and
make a move, buddy.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.400
-I'm not superstitious.

03:03.439 --> 03:06.039
There's no such thing as luck.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.039
-Oliver, did some research.

03:08.080 --> 03:11.120
The curse is potent.

03:11.159 --> 03:13.360
Doubt even your lucky cardigan
can save you.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.360
-It's not lucky.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.280
It's sentimental.

03:18.319 --> 03:20.759
Because if I believe in luck,
I have to believe I've been

03:20.800 --> 03:24.199
unlucky for a very long time.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.319
TARA (NARRATING): I guess
right now we all

03:25.360 --> 03:27.680
have our own hang-ups.

03:27.719 --> 03:31.319
Literally 1,000 thoughts are
running throughout our heads--

03:31.360 --> 03:34.439
hardest one to accept,
what happens next

03:34.479 --> 03:36.599
is out of our hands.

03:36.639 --> 03:38.840
-I'm predicting four stars.

03:38.879 --> 03:40.479
-What about a thank you dance?

03:40.520 --> 03:42.479
At the start of class tomorrow,
we all launch into a

03:42.520 --> 03:43.520
choreographed tribute.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.360
-Negative points for
originality.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.240
-[sighs]

03:46.280 --> 03:47.719
Come on, this is
our last class.

03:47.759 --> 03:50.400
And Miss Raines moving to Austin
is the end of an era.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.159
We have to show her how much
she's appreciated.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.479
-Pretty sure she'll cope.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.680
You're all just students
to her.

03:54.719 --> 03:56.199
-Shh, show time.

03:56.240 --> 03:58.120
FEMALE SPEAKER (ON TV): What's
great about this local film is

03:58.159 --> 04:02.319
that it takes a tired genre, the
dance movie, and gives it

04:02.360 --> 04:03.680
real heart and depth.

04:03.719 --> 04:05.400
TALK SHOW HOST (ON TV): And not
to mention Rhys O'Leary.

04:05.439 --> 04:07.159
I mean, who would have predicted
that performance?

04:07.199 --> 04:11.360
-I thought his chemistry with
newcomer Kat Karamakov was

04:11.400 --> 04:12.680
particularly strong.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.599
TALK SHOW HOST (ON TV): She
is very good, isn't she?

04:14.639 --> 04:16.439
I mean, there were
some moments.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.160
-That were a bit clunky.

04:18.199 --> 04:21.480
But overall, I thought it
was thoroughly engaging.

04:21.519 --> 04:22.600
-Oh, so did I. I--

04:22.639 --> 04:23.639
I'm giving it four stars.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.639
-Me too, four stars.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.279
-Whoo-hoo, my girlfriend's
thoroughly engaging.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.600
-I'm calling it impending
abandonment anxiety.

04:41.639 --> 04:45.759
-Oh, look, Sarah Envisterani--

04:45.800 --> 04:48.680
first student I ever made cry.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.079
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You
do know any time you want to

04:50.120 --> 04:51.680
move to Austin to live with
us, we'd love to have you.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.199
-You'll be newlyweds.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.800
I'd be in the way of all that
constant nakedness.

04:55.839 --> 04:57.120
-Grace.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.480
GRACE (OFFSCREEN): I punish
myself with the image.

04:58.519 --> 05:01.199
-Yeah, well, believe me,
it is a selfish offer.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.839
Even if Lucy wasn't a factor,
my company would still be

05:03.879 --> 05:06.720
angling to get you,
so think about it.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.519
MALE SPEAKER (ON RADIO): OK,
you would be calling him a

05:16.560 --> 05:19.800
liar on a morning like this, but
the Bureau of Mineralogy.

05:19.839 --> 05:23.360
Has issued a severe weather
alert predicting a midday

05:23.399 --> 05:26.480
change with strong winds
and heavy rain.

05:26.519 --> 05:29.800
And in entertainment news, Rhys
O'Leary is in town to

05:29.839 --> 05:32.839
promote his latest offering,
"Over the Rainbow." The stars

05:32.879 --> 05:35.680
will be out tonight at the
film's world prem--

05:35.720 --> 05:36.519
-He's your dad.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.759
Is it not worth a quick text?

05:38.800 --> 05:42.160
-We didn't leave things
on texting terms.

05:42.199 --> 05:43.279
-But you're graduating.

05:43.319 --> 05:46.399
He'd still want to be here.

05:46.439 --> 05:49.040
Isn't it liberating that I can
say stuff like that, now that

05:49.079 --> 05:52.040
I'm not your girlfriend or
potential girlfriend or

05:52.079 --> 05:53.160
heartbroken ex.

05:53.199 --> 05:54.439
-Didn't stop you in the past.

05:57.560 --> 06:02.639
So this is how you're going to
prepare for your audition--

06:02.680 --> 06:06.040
father/son miracles,
thank you dances.

06:06.079 --> 06:08.800
-I just don't want to go on
stage until everything's--

06:08.839 --> 06:11.040
-Perfect.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.720
You can't wrap the
entire Academy

06:12.759 --> 06:15.519
experience up into a bow.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.759
It's time to want to win.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.040
-Cast.

06:29.079 --> 06:31.319
-You and I have different
genitalia.

06:31.360 --> 06:32.839
I'm not your competition,
so why are you

06:32.879 --> 06:34.480
trying to psych me out.

06:34.519 --> 06:38.199
-It's calming, like
meditation.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.399
-I can easily get
you an audition.

06:40.439 --> 06:41.800
And it would be good for
us to have some family

06:41.839 --> 06:43.600
comforts next year.

06:43.639 --> 06:45.519
Lucy is not the greatest
cook, but watch her

06:45.560 --> 06:47.040
wax her upper lip.

06:47.079 --> 06:48.639
-I can only think about
the national.

06:48.680 --> 06:52.160
After that, Austin doesn't
even make top five.

06:52.199 --> 06:55.079
-OK, so we need to make sure
that the company's a lock for

06:55.120 --> 06:56.560
both of us.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.199
-Uh-huh.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.160
-Last class.

07:01.199 --> 07:02.319
[cheers]

07:02.360 --> 07:03.680
-All right, that's enough.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.519
To the bar, like you've
done every day for

07:16.560 --> 07:18.360
the past three years.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.560
-See, note the tea cup.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.639
You want to work the collar
bone to the elbow.

07:30.680 --> 07:32.279
And then imagine
the duck face.

07:32.319 --> 07:33.600
-This is all just window
dressing to

07:33.639 --> 07:35.480
disguise how much I clunked.

07:35.519 --> 07:37.160
-One comment does not
mean you can ditch

07:37.199 --> 07:38.480
your own movie premiere.

07:38.519 --> 07:40.800
-Oliver, don't you think I
should be at the theater

07:40.839 --> 07:42.040
supporting you guys?

07:42.079 --> 07:43.199
-I don't care.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.319
Wardrobe somehow shrunk
my other costume.

07:45.360 --> 07:48.759
Can I pull this off?

07:48.800 --> 07:50.800
Hey.

07:50.839 --> 07:52.639
Uh, I was going to message.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.839
Good luck with the
premiere tonight.

07:58.519 --> 08:01.199
-You're trying on
these and these.

08:07.319 --> 08:09.319
-Grapevine's accurate, then.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.680
She's pushing the company
more contemporary.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.199
-Which means she'll hate
my Prince Charming.

08:17.759 --> 08:20.160
-The thing you get all
twisted up on is

08:20.199 --> 08:21.720
that we're the talent.

08:21.759 --> 08:23.079
She needs us.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.160
-I did have an interview
to get to.

08:31.199 --> 08:32.200
-Of course.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.320
And hey, we're not
trying to start a

08:34.360 --> 08:36.120
bidding war or anything.

08:36.159 --> 08:39.480
We just felt it was respectful
for you to know that there are

08:39.519 --> 08:41.799
other companies getting
a tad poachy.

08:41.840 --> 08:43.600
-That must be very flattering.

08:43.639 --> 08:45.000
Congratulations.

08:45.039 --> 08:47.440
-Oh, but we're committed to
this company, like getting

08:47.480 --> 08:48.759
tattooed, "I love the
National Acad--"

08:48.799 --> 08:51.360
-Well, it's on the short list.

08:51.399 --> 08:53.480
Although it's hard to know for
sure until we have an idea of

08:53.519 --> 08:58.399
your plans for the company
how we might fit in.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.799
-You two want to know what's on
offer before you deign to

09:00.840 --> 09:02.039
audition.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.120
-Well, at the pre-champion,
I do have options.

09:04.159 --> 09:08.039
And we need are a
package deal.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.480
-Well, I'll keep that
front of mind, then.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.519
-Hooked and gagging for us.

09:16.559 --> 09:18.679
-She thinks we think we're
too good for the company.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.279
-People need to chase to know
they want something.

09:21.320 --> 09:24.559
And I'm wrangling it so that
we can stay together.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.639
-But we're not together now.

09:27.679 --> 09:29.200
We've revenge patched
a couple times.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.840
This is all the freaky workings
of your head.

09:30.879 --> 09:31.639
-Ben.

09:31.679 --> 09:32.679
-No, stay away from me.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.799
-All the studios are booked.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.039
How long do you think
you'll be.

09:51.080 --> 09:51.720
-[sighs]

09:51.759 --> 09:52.639
I don't mind sharing.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.639
-What's with the costume?

09:59.679 --> 10:01.679
I thought you were doing
"Persephone."

10:01.720 --> 10:02.960
-"Persephone" is beautiful.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.600
But Miss Raine thinks "Firebird"
is more dramatic.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.399
And my back's not
hurting, so--

10:07.440 --> 10:09.639
-Yeah, I'm just about to
ditch Prince Charming.

10:09.679 --> 10:11.480
-What?

10:11.519 --> 10:13.840
But that role may as well have
been invented for you.

10:13.879 --> 10:16.399
-They'll say Christian's
Prince is edgier.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.799
And I have Bonacello
contemporary piece I've been

10:18.840 --> 10:22.639
working on, in case.

10:22.679 --> 10:26.320
-Well, why don't I watch you
and give you feedback.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.639
And you'll watch me.

10:27.679 --> 10:29.159
And we'll both pretend we're
not completely cracked

10:29.200 --> 10:30.399
switching last minute.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.279
-Ben, it's me, the person who
hasn't ruined your career,

10:36.320 --> 10:40.080
because I'm going to fix this.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.600
[laughter]

10:46.840 --> 10:48.159
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Come on, do it again.

10:59.120 --> 11:04.320
-Here, intact, I spit on
your alleged curse.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.480
-Abigail Armstrong?

11:05.519 --> 11:07.480
-[scoffs]

11:07.519 --> 11:08.720
Better not be flowers.

11:08.759 --> 11:11.679
I explicitly told Mom and
Wes no distractions.

11:11.720 --> 11:12.840
I will not be humanized.

11:12.879 --> 11:14.200
Thank you.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.399
Wes.

11:21.840 --> 11:26.159
-[coughs]

11:26.200 --> 11:27.559
-You OK?

11:27.600 --> 11:29.639
Are you choking?

11:29.679 --> 11:32.200
What do I do?

11:32.240 --> 11:34.120
-[coughing]

11:37.840 --> 11:39.759
-Are you OK?

11:39.799 --> 11:40.480
-No.

11:40.519 --> 11:42.480
I am superstitious.

11:42.519 --> 11:43.480
And I have to go.

11:43.519 --> 11:44.320
-Where?

11:44.360 --> 11:45.679
-I need my lucky cardigan.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.279
-What?

11:47.320 --> 11:48.799
Ollie.

11:48.840 --> 11:51.080
-He's a little bit
over excited.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.840
But don't worry, I've given
him strict instructions.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.639
-Polite applause only, which is
a real shame because I've

11:56.679 --> 12:00.360
been practicing my Tara-banana
shout-out.

12:00.399 --> 12:03.679
-Christian, hey.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.240
Thanks for the invite.

12:05.279 --> 12:08.120
-Uh, Mom, Dad, this
is Raf Reed.

12:08.159 --> 12:08.519
-Hi.

12:08.559 --> 12:09.080
-Hi.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.039
-Hi.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.480
-You, uh, tell me if
you want me to go.

12:13.519 --> 12:15.159
I don't want to distract you.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.320
-No.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.720
I didn't--

12:17.759 --> 12:19.600
I didn't think you'd
want to come.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.200
-You kidding?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.399
This is my first ballet.

12:25.519 --> 12:27.480
[cheering]

12:30.840 --> 12:31.480
-Don't worry.

12:31.519 --> 12:32.799
Smile, smile.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.399
[cheering]

12:36.440 --> 12:38.799
-Kat, what was it like working
with Rhys O'Leary?

12:38.840 --> 12:41.759
Were you star struck?

12:41.799 --> 12:45.320
[cheering]

12:45.360 --> 12:46.320
-So?

12:46.360 --> 12:47.480
-Smile.

12:52.279 --> 12:53.639
PHOTOGRAPHER (OFFSCREEN):
Kat, over here.

12:53.679 --> 12:54.639
-Just relax.

12:54.679 --> 12:56.279
Let's have a nice night.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.440
Smile right.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.279

12:59.840 --> 13:03.159
[laughter]

13:03.200 --> 13:05.159
-(WHISPERING) You're
not smiling.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.279
-I'm just--

13:06.320 --> 13:07.360
I'm going to stay down
here for a while.

FEMALE SPEAKER (ON RADIO):
Distinguished guests, artistic

13:47.840 --> 13:50.399
director of the National
Ballet company, Rebecca

13:50.440 --> 13:55.120
Braithwaite, teachers, students,
parents, friends,

13:55.159 --> 13:57.200
ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

13:57.240 --> 13:59.600
year's graduating class.

13:59.639 --> 14:04.080
[applause]

14:04.120 --> 14:06.639
-I'd like to begin tonight's
performance by introducing

14:06.679 --> 14:09.720
Christian Reed, dancing
Prince Charming from

14:09.759 --> 14:13.639
"Cinderella." [applause]

14:19.200 --> 14:20.399
-Costume sabotage--

14:22.679 --> 14:24.200
takes me back.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.159
[ballet music playing]

14:32.080 --> 14:34.519
-Sorry, can we, uh, can we stop
the music for a second.

14:41.240 --> 14:44.120
A good friend of mine has been
trying to figure out the right

14:44.159 --> 14:47.120
way to say thank you
to the Academy.

14:49.840 --> 14:54.480
But it's impossible, because we
can never repay what it has

14:54.519 --> 14:59.480
given us, what you've
all given us.

15:03.639 --> 15:06.320
So I'm not a speech maker.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.639
I should probably dance now.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.519
[ballet music playing]

15:45.080 --> 15:46.639
-I loathe watching
myself on screen,

15:46.679 --> 15:48.200
too, but I do it anyway.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.240
Plus you get a whole
new craft.

15:50.279 --> 15:52.639
-Not a pressing concern, seeing
as this will be my one

15:52.679 --> 15:54.200
and only acting foray, so.

15:56.679 --> 15:57.840
Clunky--

15:57.879 --> 16:00.200
clunky is too generous.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.840
I'm horrific.

16:02.879 --> 16:06.360
How is that there even
remotely believable?

16:06.399 --> 16:08.320
KAT (ON FILM): And
second position.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.320
-I'm not ashamed of you.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.320
-You're never going to--

16:12.360 --> 16:12.960
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
You should come to

16:13.000 --> 16:15.039
LA for pilot season.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.279
I'm going to hook you
up with my manager.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.559
-Well, I--

16:18.600 --> 16:21.639
I just have this little thing
called third year.

16:21.679 --> 16:23.080
Oh, oh, I'm duck facing.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.360
Oh, no.

16:24.399 --> 16:26.519
-Hey, Ollie's just tweeted
me, "SOS, no fun.

16:26.559 --> 16:28.799
Stuck in boarding house."

16:28.840 --> 16:30.200
Someone's starved for attention.

16:33.879 --> 16:36.120
-So still following Ollie's
tweets, huh?

16:36.159 --> 16:37.320
-Onward, to the rescue.

17:02.440 --> 17:08.319
[applause]

17:08.358 --> 17:10.319
ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN): Benjamin
Tickle to the stage.

17:10.358 --> 17:11.519
Benjamin Tickle, 30 seconds.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.598
KAT (OFFSCREEN): Hold
tight, precious.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.799
We're going to bust you out.

17:17.839 --> 17:18.598
-Don't bother.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.160
The universe has been clear.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.400
I am not fated to
get a contract.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.640
I'm not the lucky one.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.400
-That's disappointing.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.400
[music playing]

17:58.359 --> 18:00.799
-You mean to tell me that on the
day of the auditions, you

18:00.839 --> 18:02.480
and Ben, in your collective
wisdom, have

18:02.519 --> 18:04.039
decided to change dances?

18:04.079 --> 18:06.240
-I knew you were upset that
I went to Saskia.

18:06.279 --> 18:07.480
I should have trusted
your judgement.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.319
-[sighs]

18:13.359 --> 18:14.680
No.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.599
It's time to trust your own.

18:17.640 --> 18:19.839
Students outgrow
their teachers.

18:19.880 --> 18:24.319
It's natural, but it can still
be difficult for us to accept.

18:24.359 --> 18:24.839
-I--

18:24.880 --> 18:25.519
I would never.

18:25.559 --> 18:26.759
That could never happen.

18:26.799 --> 18:28.519
-It means you're ready.

18:28.559 --> 18:34.119
Now, it's time for you to go
on stage as Persephone.

18:34.160 --> 18:39.319
And if you dance it the way I
know you can, your future,

18:39.359 --> 18:40.559
it's written in the stars.

18:50.119 --> 18:54.559
-I had your back, which goes
against all competitive logic.

18:54.599 --> 18:55.839
However--

18:55.880 --> 18:57.279
-You had my back, yet you
destroyed my costume?

18:57.319 --> 18:58.839
-Grace destroyed it.

18:58.880 --> 19:02.799
I neglected to tell her that
you'd switched to "Firebird."

19:02.839 --> 19:04.200
-I just switched back.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.839
-Oh, whoops.

[crashing sound]

[gasps]

19:21.599 --> 19:24.319
-You are cursed.

19:24.359 --> 19:27.839
-No, it could have
decapitated us.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.319
-[laughs]

19:29.359 --> 19:31.440
-How about I just stop blaming
the world for not giving me

19:31.480 --> 19:33.720
what I want and just
take it already.

19:33.759 --> 19:35.119
-Sounds pretty intelligent
to--

ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN): Tara
Webster, this is your

20:16.200 --> 20:17.279
one-minute call.

20:17.319 --> 20:19.680
-Hey.

20:19.720 --> 20:24.519
Look at you, nothing sticks.

20:24.559 --> 20:26.039
-I've got to go.

20:26.079 --> 20:28.400
-You know, the one thing I've
looked forward to all year is

20:28.440 --> 20:29.759
stopping you from getting
in to the company?

20:32.799 --> 20:33.640
-I'm not listening, Grace.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.039
You're better than this.

20:35.079 --> 20:39.200
-Always with the
condescension.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.440
-You are, I know you are,
because you and I

20:41.480 --> 20:43.200
were friends once.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.039
You were so loyal when
I broke my back.

20:45.079 --> 20:47.519
-And you treated me like
I was disposable.

20:50.680 --> 20:54.319
-I would give anything to make
things right between us, I

20:54.359 --> 20:55.519
really would.

21:14.119 --> 21:16.240
TARA (NARRATING): I'm a farmer's
daughter I know you

21:16.279 --> 21:19.400
can plant the crop and
do all the work.

21:19.440 --> 21:23.279
But the weather has
the final word--

21:23.319 --> 21:27.039
those forces of nature bigger
than you that can't be

21:27.079 --> 21:29.400
controlled.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.400
[ballet music playing]

22:22.359 --> 22:23.759
TARA (NARRATING): Dad explained
to me once how a

22:23.799 --> 22:27.640
perfect storm is created, that
a combination of harmless

22:27.680 --> 22:34.200
events occurring together
conspire to produce an outcome

22:34.240 --> 22:35.440
that is disastrous.

22:53.519 --> 23:03.799
If not for a bead, if
I'd danced first, or

23:03.839 --> 23:07.440
last, or not at all.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.599
If my back wasn't already
fractured.

Move away, please.

23:40.839 --> 23:44.359
It's going to be OK.

TARA (NARRATING): It really
doesn't matter if you call it

23:46.079 --> 23:52.160
random chance, bad
luck, my fate.

23:52.200 --> 23:56.200
The difference between
everything and nothing comes

23:56.240 --> 24:00.480
down to if, if, if.
