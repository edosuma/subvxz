A HIGH NUMBER LIKE 867.

CORY! CORY! CORY!

10:13.567 --> 10:16.400
THE BALL LEAVES MY HANDS
AND ARCS IN SUPER-SLOW MOTION

10:16.400 --> 10:18.367
AS THE CROWD GOES
DEATHLY SILENT.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.200
AND THEN...SWISH!

10:20.200 --> 10:21.667
NOTHING BUT NET!

10:21.667 --> 10:23.300
THE CROWD GOES AAH!

10:23.300 --> 10:25.367
I WIN THE GAME!

10:25.367 --> 10:26.734
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

10:26.734 --> 10:28.233
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I MISSED IT.

10:28.233 --> 10:30.000
YOU'RE
SUCH A HERO, COR.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
NO, I'M NOT.
YOU KNOW WHY?

10:32.000 --> 10:33.133
I DIDN'T EVEN
GET TO PLAY.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.500
I JUST MADE
ALL THAT STUFF UP.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.667
HE HAS AN ACTIVE
IMAGINATION.

10:41.667 --> 10:43.500
YOU KNOW WHY
I DON'T GET TO PLAY?

10:43.500 --> 10:45.200
BECAUSE I'M JUST
A SECOND STRING,

10:45.200 --> 10:46.734
BENCH-WARMING
NOBODY.

10:46.734 --> 10:48.100
CORY--
FIRST OF ALL,

10:48.100 --> 10:49.900
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH BEING SECOND STRING.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.300
YEAH, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH BEING SECOND STRING.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.900
NOW, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
THIS BEFORE, COR?

10:54.900 --> 10:56.900
HE TOLD ME.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.567
IT'S GOING TO COST ME
THE CAR, ISN'T IT?

10:59.567 --> 11:00.734
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

11:00.734 --> 11:02.200
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TELL US
WHAT HE SAYS.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.900
THAT'S WHY YOU SLEEP
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HIM.

11:04.900 --> 11:07.600
YOU SEE? I'M TRYING
TO SPILL MY GUTS OUT,

11:07.600 --> 11:09.500
AND YOU GUYS ARE HAVING
A FAMILY MEETING.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.734
THIS IS WHY
I HAVE TO MAKE UP

11:10.734 --> 11:12.867
A WHOLE EXCITING LIFE
TO GET ANY ATTENTION.

11:12.867 --> 11:14.200
OH, CORY,
THAT ISN'T TRUE.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.500
YES, IT IS.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.200
YOU SPEND HALF YOUR DAY
WITH ERIC AT THE STORE,

11:17.200 --> 11:18.500
AND THE REST OF THE TIME

11:18.500 --> 11:20.367
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
HIS PATHETIC LOVE LIFE.

11:20.367 --> 11:21.667
HEY.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.400
AND YOU'RE ALWAYS BRAIDING
MORGAN'S HAIR

11:23.400 --> 11:24.767
OR MAKING A COSTUME
FOR HER.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.200
AND, I MEAN, I GET IT

11:26.200 --> 11:28.133
THAT SHE'S THE BABY OF
THE FAMILY AND ALL, BUT--

11:28.133 --> 11:29.500
YOU KNOW,
BEING SECOND STRING

11:29.500 --> 11:30.967
IN BASKETBALL
IS HARD ENOUGH,

11:30.967 --> 11:32.700
BUT I'M ONLY
ON THE SECOND STRING

11:32.700 --> 11:33.967
IN MY OWN FAMILY.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.000
WHY DON'T YOU WANT ME
TO GO UP AND TALK TO HIM?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.600
BECAUSE I THINK YOU AND I
SHOULD TALK FIRST.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.233
WHAT ABOUT? CORY'S HAD
A BASKETBALL DISAPPOINTMENT.

11:48.233 --> 11:50.200
HE'S OVERREACTING.
I'M GOING TO GO TELL HIM THAT.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.500
IS HE OVERREACTING?

11:51.500 --> 11:52.834
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
THAT HE'S RIGHT?

11:52.834 --> 11:53.967
THAT I SPEND MORE TIME
WITH ERIC,

11:53.967 --> 11:55.734
I DON'T CARE AS MUCH
ABOUT HIM?

11:55.734 --> 11:57.400
NO. I JUST THINK
THAT CORY

11:57.400 --> 12:00.066
IS GOING THROUGH
MIDDLE-PAUSE.

12:00.066 --> 12:02.700
IS THAT
A SCIENTIFIC TERM?

12:02.700 --> 12:06.600
YEAH. I MEAN, THIS WEEK,
ERIC HAS GIRL PROBLEMS,

12:06.600 --> 12:08.300
MORGAN NEEDS
TO BE A PRINCESS,

12:08.300 --> 12:09.500
AND THERE'S
A KID IN THE MIDDLE

12:09.500 --> 12:10.600
THAT DIDN'T GET HEARD.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.867
BECAUSE THERE'S
3 OF THEM NOW.

12:12.867 --> 12:14.834
WE LET OURSELVES
GET OUTNUMBERED.

12:14.834 --> 12:15.834
YEP. WHEN THERE
WERE 2 OF THEM,

12:15.834 --> 12:17.500
WE HAD THEM COVERED
MAN-TO-MAN.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.900
NOW WE'RE
IN A ZONE DEFENSE,

12:18.900 --> 12:20.200
AND CORY'S PROBLEM
GOT BY US.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.800
WHAT'S THE GAME PLAN,
COACH?

12:21.800 --> 12:24.767
FULL COURT PRESS,
DOUBLE-TEAM CORY.

12:24.767 --> 12:25.967
GO, TEAM, GO.

12:25.967 --> 12:27.000
HEY.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.233
JUST A LITTLE
SPORT THING.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.600
WASN'T THAT
A GREAT GAME YESTERDAY,

12:38.600 --> 12:40.100
SITTING ON THE BENCH,

12:40.100 --> 12:41.734

ANY CLOSER TO THE ACTION

13:13.100 --> 13:14.867

THE STARTING QUARTERBACK.

13:14.867 --> 13:16.700
AND THEN HE WON MVP.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.033

YOU'D LIKE IT.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.300

13:21.300 --> 13:22.834

FROM THE BRINK.

13:22.834 --> 13:24.900
IF THEY CAN DO IT,
YOU CAN DO IT.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.867
YEAH! THAT'LL PROVE
I'M WORTH SOMETHING.

13:26.867 --> 13:28.467
MAYBE COACH'LL PUT YOU
IN THE GAME TODAY.

13:28.467 --> 13:29.867

UH...

16:03.233 --> 16:05.100
I'M BURYING A HAMSTER.

MR. FEENY,
NOBODY'S IN MY HOUSE.

16:14.834 --> 16:16.900
MY FAMILY'S ABANDONED ME.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.000
IS THAT SO?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.500
WHY WOULD THEY DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

16:19.500 --> 16:21.467
MAYBE BECAUSE I ONLY
MADE SECOND-STRING,

16:21.467 --> 16:23.000
AND THEY WERE
ASHAMED OF ME.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.600
YOU THINK THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED, HUH?

16:24.600 --> 16:26.033
THAT'S WHY I'M TRYING
TO SURVIVE ON MY OWN.

16:26.033 --> 16:27.500
I MEAN, I SAW
YOUR CHICKEN COOKING,

16:27.500 --> 16:31.300
AND THE VOICE OF CHUCK DARWIN

16:39.500 --> 16:40.900
SNATCHING A CHICKEN
FROM A GRILL

16:40.900 --> 16:44.834
IS HARDLY CHASING DOWN

16:44.834 --> 16:46.100
AND IN THE SECOND PLACE,

16:46.100 --> 16:48.000
YOUR FAMILY
DIDN'T ABANDON YOU.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.100
THEY WENT TO
YOUR BASKETBALL GAME.

16:50.100 --> 16:53.133
MY FAMILY
WENT TO MY GAME? WHY?

16:53.133 --> 16:56.300
ONE WOULD ASSUME THAT THEY
WANTED TO WATCH YOU PLAY.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.367

16:58.367 --> 16:59.934

ONE WOULD ASSUME

17:04.000 --> 17:05.800
THAT THEY WENT
TO WATCH YOU ROT.

DO THAT?

17:15.467 --> 17:18.200

OF CHUCK DARWIN,

17:18.200 --> 17:19.367

17:19.367 --> 17:21.967
THAT THE HIGHEST FORM
OF EVOLUTION

17:21.967 --> 17:23.967
IS A FAMILY

OF THE DOUBT.

PERSONAL EVOLUTION.

WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT

18:55.000 --> 18:57.300
3 FIRST-STRINGERS
WOULD FOUL OUT,

18:57.300 --> 18:58.834
AND THEY'D NEED ME
TO JUMP IN?

18:58.834 --> 19:00.066
YEAH, MAYBE
YOUR COACH LEARNED

19:00.066 --> 19:01.100

19:24.400 --> 19:25.667

19:25.667 --> 19:27.367

FROM ME TONIGHT.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.567
SHE WANTS TO HEAR A STORY
FROM THE BASKETBALL STAR.

19:36.567 --> 19:37.900
I THINK
I CAN SQUEEZE IN

19:37.900 --> 19:39.133
A LITTLE
<i>GREEN EGGS AND HAM </i>

19:39.133 --> 19:40.567
BEFORE
I HIT THE SHOWERS.

19:40.567 --> 19:42.200
HEY, GUYS?

19:42.200 --> 19:43.400
HEY, COR.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.500
HOW COME YOU DROVE
ALL THE WAY OUT TO MY GAME?

19:45.500 --> 19:47.033
I MEAN, YOU KNEW
I WAS JUST GOING TO SIT

19:47.033 --> 19:48.233
ON THE BENCH.

19:48.233 --> 19:50.100
YOU MUST'VE HAD
SOMETHING BETTER TO DO.

19:52.300 --> 19:55.033
ME? NO.

19:55.033 --> 19:56.734
WELL, CORY, IT REALLY
DOESN'T MATTER TO US

19:56.734 --> 19:59.800
IF YOU SIT ON THE BENCH
OR IF YOU SCORE 100 POINTS.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.100
COME ON, IT DOES SO.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.367
NO, IT REALLY DOESN'T.
I MEAN, THERE ARE TIMES

20:03.367 --> 20:06.133
WHEN I CATCH YOUR FATHER
JUST WATCHING YOU SLEEP.

20:06.133 --> 20:08.700
ONLY IF THERE'S
NOTHING GOOD ON TV.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.300
YOU STILL
WATCH ME SLEEP?

20:10.300 --> 20:11.800
DO YOU WATCH ERIC?

20:11.800 --> 20:14.767
YEAH, BUT I'LL PROBABLY
STOP WHEN HE'S A SENIOR

20:14.767 --> 20:16.500
AND HE GETS A LIFE.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.834
HEY, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

20:18.834 --> 20:20.233
I THINK I'M GOING
TO GO INTO THE KITCHEN

20:20.233 --> 20:21.567
AND EAT SOMETHING
THAT CAUSES A LOT OF ZITS

20:21.567 --> 20:24.367
BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.500
LOOK, COR, THERE'S
NOBODY IN THIS FAMILY

20:28.500 --> 20:29.867
THAT'S GOING
TO BE DISAPPOINTED

20:29.867 --> 20:33.100
BY YOU BEING SECOND-STRING,
THIRD-STRING, OR NO-STRING,

20:33.100 --> 20:35.200
AS LONG AS YOU
TRY THE BEST YOU CAN.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.300
WE'RE ONLY DISAPPOINTED
WHEN YOU DON'T TELL US

20:37.300 --> 20:38.967
IF SOMETHING'S
BOTHERING YOU.

20:38.967 --> 20:41.500
WELL, I TRIED, BUT
NOBODY WAS LISTENING.

20:41.500 --> 20:45.033
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO'S
IN MY ROOM TELLING ME A STORY?

20:45.033 --> 20:47.100
NOBODY.

20:47.100 --> 20:49.100
COME ON, HONEY,
YOU HAVE TO WAIT A MINUTE.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.400
WE'RE TALKING WITH CORY.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.700
WELL, LOOK, CORY,

20:52.700 --> 20:54.800
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO MAKE ME LISTEN.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.100
HOW?

20:56.100 --> 21:00.233
JUST GRAB MY FACE
AND SAY, "HEY, DAD!

21:00.233 --> 21:01.567
LISTEN TO ME!"

21:01.567 --> 21:04.100
AS LONG AS YOU GOT MY FACE,
YOU GOT MY ATTENTION.

21:05.867 --> 21:07.800
DAD?
YEAH?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.834
LET GO OF MY FACE.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.600
I FEEL KIND OF BAD
ABOUT THE THINGS I SAID.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.800
UH-HUH.

21:15.800 --> 21:19.400
AND, WELL...

21:19.400 --> 21:21.900
DON'T YOU HATE IT WHEN
YOU HAVE TO APOLOGIZE?

21:21.900 --> 21:25.000
YEAH, BUT WE DON'T MIND
HEARING THEM.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.133
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU'RE 11,

21:27.133 --> 21:28.600
AND YOU START
HANGING OUT

21:28.600 --> 21:30.900
AT A LOT OF OTHER
SIXTH GRADERS' HOUSES,

21:30.900 --> 21:33.033
YOU GET TO KNOW
A LOT OF OTHER PARENTS.

21:33.033 --> 21:34.400
BELIEVE ME,
I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

21:34.400 --> 21:36.367
BETWEEN THE GOOD ONES
AND THE BAD ONES.

21:36.367 --> 21:38.100
AND?

21:38.100 --> 21:40.500
AND...

21:40.500 --> 21:42.667
WELL...

21:42.667 --> 21:45.133
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, BLOOD?

21:45.133 --> 21:46.400
HEY!

21:48.567 --> 21:50.100
WHERE'S MY STORY?

21:54.400 --> 21:55.500
GOOD NIGHT.

21:56.700 --> 21:57.667
GOOD NIGHT.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.300
I'M TELLING YOU,

22:15.300 --> 22:17.500
FEENY'S A MANIAC
BEHIND THE WHEEL.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.600
I DIDN'T KNOW A GREMLIN
COULD GO THAT FAST.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.500
NO WAY. FEENY?

22:21.500 --> 22:23.400
THE GUY TAKES 20 MINUTES
TO PEEL AN ORANGE.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.867
HEY, I WAS IN THE CAR.

22:24.867 --> 22:27.500
HE WAS CLIPPING CORNERS,
DRIVING ON THE SIDEWALK,

22:27.500 --> 22:29.600
CATCHING AIR
OFF SPEED BUMPS.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.867
OUR MR. FEENY
BURNING RUBBER?

22:31.867 --> 22:33.600
I THINK NOT.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.600
I THINK WHAT WE SEE
IN THE CLASSROOM

22:35.600 --> 22:38.367
JUST MAY BE THE CLARK KENT
SIDE OF MR. FEENY.

22:38.367 --> 22:40.567
I WOULD'VE HAD YOU

22:40.567 --> 22:41.967
IF THAT LIGHT HADN'T
TURNED YELLOW.

22:41.967 --> 22:44.300
HEY, YOU SNOOZE,
YOU LOSE.
