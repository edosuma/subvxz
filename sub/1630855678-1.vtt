00:34.784 --> 00:41.750
THE GREAT SEDUCTION

00:44.169 --> 00:48.298
[man] I'll tell you the secret of living
in a paradise called Santa María.

00:48.798 --> 00:54.095
We are a small but mighty town
with a heart the size of a soccer stadium.

00:54.846 --> 00:59.559
120 lucky people
inhabit this oasis of rowdy pirates.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.686
Ever since I was a kid,

01:01.770 --> 01:04.022
I always wanted to go fishing
with my parents.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.024
[thunder rumbling]

01:10.278 --> 01:12.280
[cheerful music continues]

01:16.993 --> 01:19.496
[man] They would spend countless hours
every day on their boats,

01:19.579 --> 01:23.041
casting their nets into the water
and returning with the day's catch.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.091
They worked from dusk till dawn.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.760
And while it was not a glamorous job,
they loved it.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.346
It's true.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.181
We weren't rich by any means,

01:38.264 --> 01:41.309
but we felt blessed
with the simple life we had.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.229
Let's eat!

01:45.188 --> 01:48.566
[man] Our hearts were filled
with happiness and contentment.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.569
Well, at least
that's what my parents told me.

01:57.033 --> 02:00.662
At night, Santa María
shined brighter and more beautiful

02:00.745 --> 02:03.540
than all the stars in the sky.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.833
[thunder rumbling]

02:04.916 --> 02:08.044
[man] But one day,
everything suddenly changed.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.839
The neighboring town
opened up a modern fish-packing company.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.758
And shortly after,
we had nothing more to fish.

02:13.842 --> 02:14.968
It destroyed us.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.761
[thunder rumbling]

02:16.845 --> 02:17.679
MEXICAN POST

02:17.762 --> 02:21.015
Our once prosperous town
now had to rely on the few bucks

02:21.099 --> 02:23.977
that the Unemployment Office
would hand out every month.

02:24.060 --> 02:27.188
[indistinct chattering]

02:29.190 --> 02:30.358
[woman] Thank you, sir.

02:32.068 --> 02:34.988
[man] In the following years,
with fishing no longer possible,

02:35.071 --> 02:38.616
many left in search of the American Dream,
or in some cases, nightmare.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.785
My brother Pablo being one of them.

02:42.704 --> 02:46.332
My name is Germán, and what runs
through my veins isn't blood.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.084
It's Santa María.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.670
I'm never leaving here.

[groaning]

02:54.841 --> 02:57.135
Germán, stop annoying the dog.

02:57.218 --> 02:59.220
[Germán] He's the one annoying me.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.807
[roosters crowing in distance]

03:02.891 --> 03:03.766
[Germán] Hmm.

03:04.350 --> 03:08.396
[Germán] At the time, I had no idea
our lives were about to change forever.

03:08.479 --> 03:11.399
Along with our little slice of heaven,
Santa María.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.068
-[sighs]
-[cheerful music continues]

03:14.152 --> 03:15.904
[rooster crowing]

03:18.865 --> 03:20.200
Good morning!

03:20.283 --> 03:23.203
-How are you, Don Claudio?
-Germán. Good morning.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.253
-[Anita] Good morning.
-[man] Good morning, Anita.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.589
Good morning, Simón. How are you?

03:34.672 --> 03:35.757
I'm all right, Anita.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.258
[Anita] Here you go.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.676
-Thank you.
-Of course.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.930
-Morning, Anita.
-Germán, good morning.

03:43.097 --> 03:45.642
I'm also gonna collect my mother's
if you don't mind.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.023
[Anita] I don't think that's a good idea,
but it's on you.

03:52.106 --> 03:52.941
Yeah.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.360
Thank you. Have a good day.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.489
[employee] Mm-hmm.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.243
Afternoon. I've come to cash these checks.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.537
Here's mine, and here's my mother's.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.790
Germán, I've already told you I can't.

04:08.873 --> 04:09.832
Okay.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.044
You've seen this letter
a thousand times, right? Cash it.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.671
-It's illegal.
-It's not illegal.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.965
-It's illegal.
-No, it isn't. The letter says so.

04:17.674 --> 04:18.925
I'll lose my job, Germán.

04:19.008 --> 04:21.928
Of course you won't. Relax.
If you do, I'll shave my head.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.562
Have a good day.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.903
[Germán] I got the money.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.447
This will cover food for another month.

04:43.616 --> 04:44.492
What is it?

04:45.159 --> 04:47.829
My brother called.
There's an opportunity in the city.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.623
[melancholy music playing]

04:50.707 --> 04:52.166
Again with that, María?

04:54.002 --> 04:55.169
You really want to leave?

04:55.253 --> 04:57.463
If that will give us work, then yes.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.257
But we can't leave just like that.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.675
Why not?

05:00.758 --> 05:02.635
Because this is our home.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.763
Yes, yes, Germán.
But we don't have a job in this town.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.348
We've got the unemployment checks.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.351
Do you really want us
to keep living like thieves?

05:10.435 --> 05:14.147
To keep collecting a government check
that's not even under your name?

05:14.230 --> 05:15.940
-It is under my name.
-[groans]

05:16.024 --> 05:18.526
It is, and I have this power of attorney
for the other one.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.404
-[sighs] Of someone who's already dead.
-Not according to the government.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.239
Her grave says otherwise.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.872
I'm not going to work
in the city, María. Enough.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.832
The job is for me, Germán.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.501
I can no longer play along
with your fantasy.

05:35.585 --> 05:36.502
I'm sorry.

[man on speaker]
Announcing a mandatory town meeting!

05:54.604 --> 05:56.189
[Germán] Morning. Good morning.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.779
What? Wasn't there a meeting?
Where's everybody?

06:03.404 --> 06:05.281
-Held up by traffic.
-[Germán exhales]

06:05.948 --> 06:07.950
For a couple years now, actually.

06:08.451 --> 06:11.037
Well then, shall we start or what?

06:12.663 --> 06:14.499
I spoke to the packing company.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.335
Wha-- Which… which packing company?

06:17.877 --> 06:19.253
The fish-packing company.

06:20.004 --> 06:23.049
The company is considering
opening a plant here

06:23.132 --> 06:24.550
and wants to give all of us jobs.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.219
And why don't you look happy?

06:26.302 --> 06:27.845
Because we will never make it.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.766
But you're the mayor.
You have to do something.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.726
We need that packing company.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.562
We need to start selling our fish
to the other towns.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.233
I've tried everything I can think of

06:40.316 --> 06:42.527
to convince them
to open here in Santa María.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.989
Well, it seems it's not enough.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.159
Listen, Benjamín. I begged them.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.246
But they're asking for a doctor. A doctor!

06:54.831 --> 06:59.001
They're claiming their insurance company
won't authorize the new packing facility

06:59.085 --> 07:01.754
unless we have a doctor permanently.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.214
Well then, let's hire one!

07:03.297 --> 07:05.341
Oh, Germán!

07:05.425 --> 07:07.844
-We live in Santa María, you fool!
-[Germán] So what?

07:07.927 --> 07:09.387
We've been trying for 15 years,

07:09.470 --> 07:11.889
searching for a doctor
willing to settle here.

07:11.973 --> 07:12.849
That's the issue.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.226
We need to stop searching
and start finding.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.437
Screw this. I'm out.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.856
-Ramón!
-[Simón] Brilliant idea.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.524
No one ever thought of that.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.821
There has to be a doctor
who wants to live here.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.782
And we'll find him.

07:30.867 --> 07:31.742
You'll see.

07:36.914 --> 07:39.667
First my brother and now María?

07:42.044 --> 07:44.172
I think it's time for you
to leave this town.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.381
No, no, no, no.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.092
My home is in this town.

07:48.676 --> 07:52.763
[Germán] My roots are here.
The only way I'm leaving is in a casket.

07:52.847 --> 07:53.723
Really?

07:54.974 --> 07:56.434
You're just gonna let her go?

08:03.399 --> 08:04.984
[Ramón] Pass me that one first.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.278
That one. Careful, care--

08:07.361 --> 08:08.279
There you go.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.407
This one goes there.

08:11.991 --> 08:12.825
[woman] Ramón.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.330
[Germán] What… what are you doing?

08:20.041 --> 08:21.792
[Ramón] We're going on vacation.

08:21.876 --> 08:25.588
[Germán] With all your things
and your furniture?

08:26.589 --> 08:27.465
At this time?

08:28.049 --> 08:31.844
[sighs] The truth is
I got a good job in the city.

08:33.721 --> 08:34.555
Besides…

08:34.639 --> 08:36.265
Sweetie, come here, please.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.644
My daughter needs glasses.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.022
She's as blind as her mom.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.232
My sight's terrible.

08:44.315 --> 08:46.025
I mean, I married this man.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.653
What about the packing company?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.114
Good luck, Germán.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.579
But what will we do
if we manage to get a doctor here?

09:40.496 --> 09:42.415
How are we going to make him stay?

09:43.291 --> 09:46.419
Well, uh, we're going to convince…

09:46.961 --> 09:49.505
No, we will seduce him.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.550
-[Simón] Seduce him.
-[Anita] How exactly?

09:54.510 --> 09:57.221
Well, we… we'll think of something, right?

09:57.805 --> 09:59.181
-Yes, yes.
-[Anita] Ah.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.517
With your usual lies, then?

10:01.601 --> 10:05.062
Anita, don't you want the town
to be the way it used to be?

10:05.730 --> 10:10.109
With a company that could potentially lie
about everything it promised you?

10:10.192 --> 10:12.069
Everything it promised us, Anita.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.614
Remember, this benefits everybody.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.408
It's for you, for me, for Simón,

10:17.491 --> 10:19.702
for our town, and for the school.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.455
For the school, Anita.

[Anita] Hmm.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.338
Scratch off "seven hours" from the city

10:30.421 --> 10:33.341
and say that we're only three hours away!

10:33.424 --> 10:34.634
[Simón groans]

10:34.717 --> 10:37.511
What? Three, six, seven hours.
Time is a relative thing.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.805

10:40.514 --> 10:41.807
[Anita] Anything else?

10:41.891 --> 10:43.267
-Anything else?
-Huh? No.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.393
I'm going to print it.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.480
[all] Aw!

10:49.065 --> 10:52.234
[Germán] Letters, letters,
and more letters.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.071
We sent out letters to every doctor
living in the nearest city

10:55.154 --> 10:59.158
who would be willing to leave their job
and come live in our little fishing town.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.369
We had our local post office
working overtime

11:01.452 --> 11:03.162
to make sure all the letters went out.

11:03.245 --> 11:06.415
Long, painstaking hours were spent
licking stamps and envelopes.

11:07.958 --> 11:12.004
And we sent them out with the same energy
and innocence as a child writing to Santa,

11:12.755 --> 11:15.633
hoping we, too,
would get what we had asked for.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.012
The whole town asked for the same thing.

11:20.096 --> 11:23.391
A town doctor that would allow us
to have our own fish-packing company.

11:23.474 --> 11:27.269
Letters after letters
and even some more letters.

11:28.604 --> 11:29.772
We won't give up.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.901
We'll change one of their lives,
and they don't know it yet.

I'm sure they'll give me
the position at the hospital.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.331
[woman] Of course you'll get it.
You're the hardest worker I know.

You've always been a very capable doctor,
always there for your patients.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.785
Your track record is flawless.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.246
However, given the circumstances,

13:09.330 --> 13:12.208
I've been forced
to give the position to another doctor.

[woman] I'm so sorry, baby!
I can't believe it.

13:27.765 --> 13:30.267
Well, I'll see you later for dinner.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.146
Actually, Val is coming to town,
and I promised her we'd meet up.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.984
Lucía, I booked it months ago.

13:39.068 --> 13:42.196
["Soy Basura" by Pájaros Vampiro playing]

13:49.787 --> 13:51.163
Ah!

13:52.665 --> 13:55.501
[giggles] Oh!

13:56.168 --> 13:58.587
[man 3] How could you? It's unacceptable!

14:00.005 --> 14:01.882
-[Suárez] I swear that isn't me.
-[giggles]

14:01.966 --> 14:03.968
[Suárez] I have no idea what got over me.

14:04.051 --> 14:07.263
Now I'm certain
I was right not giving you the position.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.140
Getting wasted and pissing on my car?

14:10.224 --> 14:13.227
Only because you're a great doctor
and a good person

14:13.310 --> 14:15.437
am I not taking your medical license away.

14:15.938 --> 14:16.981
However,

14:17.606 --> 14:19.441
if you want to keep working
at this hospital,

14:19.525 --> 14:20.776
you must go to this town.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.363
Santa María. 120 inhabitants.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.658
You'll be their doctor for one month.

14:29.743 --> 14:30.578
No.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.372
Look, chief, you can't do this to me.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.040
Would you rather lose your license?

14:35.124 --> 14:38.335
[sighs] But you can't send me
to a town like that.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.503
You leave on Monday.

14:42.756 --> 14:43.591
[sighs]

14:44.842 --> 14:46.719
[man on speaker]
Attention! We've found a doctor!

14:46.802 --> 14:50.347
Announcing a mandatory town meeting!

14:50.431 --> 14:54.101
We have to fix the bell.
That speaker is just garbage.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.562
Well, no one
came to the meeting to fix it.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.230
[Germán sighs]

14:59.732 --> 15:00.608
Damn it!

15:05.863 --> 15:07.865
[metallic clattering]

15:13.329 --> 15:14.914
Listen! Santa María!

15:16.206 --> 15:17.958
There's a town meeting!

15:18.918 --> 15:20.294
There's a meeting, damn it!

15:20.377 --> 15:21.420
There's a meeting!

15:23.297 --> 15:26.050
Come on, Felipe. It's meeting time!
Meeting time, everybody!

15:27.718 --> 15:29.178
Come on! Let's go!

15:29.845 --> 15:31.847
[inspirational music playing]

15:32.806 --> 15:35.392
[Germán] Hustle.
Let's get one thing clear.

15:35.476 --> 15:39.271
If you hear the church speaker,
it means there's a town meeting!

15:39.355 --> 15:40.397
Listen up.

15:40.481 --> 15:44.068
A doctor is coming to Santa María
for one month.

15:44.985 --> 15:48.948
We have exactly one month
to convince this doctor

15:49.031 --> 15:51.450
to move here
and sign a long-term contract.

15:51.533 --> 15:52.743
If the doctor signs,

15:53.619 --> 15:55.788
we will get the packing company for sure!

15:56.622 --> 15:58.290
-It ain't for sure.
-[Germán] Yes, it is.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.625
[Benjamín grunts]

15:59.708 --> 16:02.252
Of course it is.
Why wouldn't it be? Anyway!

16:02.336 --> 16:04.630
We'll finally be able to have jobs again.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.508
And we'll establish a joint venture
so that, in time,

16:07.591 --> 16:09.259
we all own the packing company.

16:09.343 --> 16:13.013
Who doesn't want to throw away
those checks we receive each month?

16:13.764 --> 16:15.432
To sell our own fish.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.893
Don't you want your husbands
to come back from the US?

16:17.977 --> 16:21.355
-Yes!
-We have to put our town back on the map.

16:21.438 --> 16:25.693
Instead of going to beg gringos
for a couple of bucks,

16:25.776 --> 16:28.779
alone, without families,
barely speaking another language!

16:29.363 --> 16:32.658
We have exactly one month
to convince this doctor

16:33.200 --> 16:36.620
that Santa María
is the most beautiful place to live!

16:36.704 --> 16:38.080
-Because it is!
-[all] Yes!

16:38.163 --> 16:39.832
[all clapping]

16:41.917 --> 16:45.379
[Germán] We have one month
to convince this doctor, Mateo Suárez,

16:46.005 --> 16:48.424
that Santa María
is the town he was waiting for.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.635
To have him fall in love with Santa María!

16:54.471 --> 16:55.389
Come on!

16:57.391 --> 16:58.726
[man] Tamales!

16:59.351 --> 17:01.603
I've got mole! Sweet and hot tamales!

17:01.687 --> 17:03.897
Come get your tamales!

17:06.275 --> 17:08.861
[Germán] It has to be love at first sight.

17:09.862 --> 17:10.821
You are right.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.490
We need to leave the town spotless!

17:13.574 --> 17:15.409
CLEAN THE TOWN
REPAIR THE CHURCH

17:15.492 --> 17:17.453
Do you know what would be a great idea?

17:18.245 --> 17:21.874
For him to find money.
There's nothing better than to find money.

17:21.957 --> 17:25.169
It doesn't matter if it's a quarter.
You're happy for a few days.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.712
You feel lucky.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.922
We can seduce him like that.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.758
Yeah, yeah. Good idea!

17:32.176 --> 17:33.010
Really, Germán?

17:33.761 --> 17:34.928
Go ahead, do it. Do it.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.764
And what's our budget look like?

17:36.847 --> 17:38.766
What do you mean "what's our budget"?

17:38.849 --> 17:40.934
You're the one
in charge of the budget, damn it!

17:41.602 --> 17:44.521
Okay, first things first.
How will we bring him?

17:44.605 --> 17:46.982
Huh? We'll scare him off with our rafts.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.108
[Simón] I know.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.986
Let's get an amazing catamaran.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.156
No, a yacht would be better.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.910
Now we need the most modern house
to accommodate him there.

17:57.993 --> 17:58.911
Use mine.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.579
What? Yours?

18:00.662 --> 18:02.581
-I mean, it's modern, but--
-But what?

18:02.664 --> 18:03.582
But it's horrible.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.250
It's the most modern in town.

18:05.334 --> 18:08.378
That's the way
houses in the city are made like this.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.588
[Simón] What? Horrible?

18:09.671 --> 18:11.423
It's the only one with a landline.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.092
American Football League.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.218
-Modern.
-Horrible.

18:14.301 --> 18:15.928
-Modern!
-Horrible!

18:16.011 --> 18:17.387
American Football League!

18:17.471 --> 18:19.640
I was… I was
researching the doctor online.

18:19.723 --> 18:22.601
He's a fan of American football.

18:26.688 --> 18:27.689
[TV announcer chattering]

18:27.773 --> 18:31.360
These are basically the rules,
the field, and the uniforms.

18:32.569 --> 18:35.656
Yeah, it's almost
the same thing as soccer, no?

18:35.739 --> 18:37.157
-[Simón] Yeah.
-Yes.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.202
[TV announcer chattering]

18:40.285 --> 18:41.203
Oh!

18:44.790 --> 18:46.542
Shouldn't we remove the goals?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.043
[whimsical music playing]

18:48.127 --> 18:52.923
[Germán] The art of seduction
requires one to look good and smell good.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.007
A conqueror.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.136
One must understand
what they want to seduce.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.847
[exhaling]

18:59.930 --> 19:02.558
[Germán] One must be able
to speak their native language.

19:03.851 --> 19:07.354
Tell them exactly what they want to hear
when they want to hear it.

19:07.437 --> 19:10.482
The art of seduction seems easy,
but it's quite a complicated endeavor.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.192
In our case,

19:12.276 --> 19:15.529
successfully seducing the doctor
will take the entire town.

19:15.612 --> 19:16.488
High five.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.992
[Germán] They thought we were lazy bums,
only good at collecting unemployment.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.830
No one will ever need to stand in line
to collect those checks.

19:26.081 --> 19:30.460
Through our cooperation and diligent work
from sunrise to sundown,

19:30.544 --> 19:32.838
we will show them
what Santa María is really capable of.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.759
[TV announcer chattering]

19:37.843 --> 19:39.845
[whimsical music continues]

19:48.770 --> 19:49.897
You are beautiful.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.192
[cow mooing]

19:56.445 --> 19:57.362
[blows]

19:57.446 --> 19:58.405
[man] Good as new.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.037
[woman gasps]

20:09.958 --> 20:11.501
It's pink, Consuelo.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.503
Oh, come on. It's basically white!

20:13.587 --> 20:15.923
-It's pink!
-Ugh!

20:18.717 --> 20:20.052
It's perfect!

20:25.057 --> 20:26.892
[wind gusting]

20:34.733 --> 20:36.193
What are we doing this for?

20:36.276 --> 20:38.028
We're gonna monitor his landline.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.322
-What for?
-To get to know him better.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.907
-Ah.
-Oh shoot!

20:43.325 --> 20:45.994
[whimsical music continues]

20:52.459 --> 20:53.293
[bell ringing]

20:53.377 --> 20:56.004
[Benjamín] It's fixed!

20:56.505 --> 21:00.008
Long live Santa María!

21:02.344 --> 21:03.470
[man] Son of a bitch.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.265
[Simón] There are the positions.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.307
-Whose?
-When?

21:07.391 --> 21:11.186
No, hold on. We need to see
the yard indicators to the goal line here.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.646
[all chattering]

21:13.647 --> 21:14.648
Yard by yard.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.150
[all clamoring]

21:21.738 --> 21:23.991
[Simón] Enough, calm down!

21:24.074 --> 21:25.534
[all clamoring]

21:26.118 --> 21:28.161
[Anita] Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

21:28.870 --> 21:30.080
[clamoring stops]

21:30.998 --> 21:32.874
We only need two teams.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.545
It's obvious nobody read the manual.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.298
Who wants to kick off the ball first?

21:39.381 --> 21:41.133
To the middle. And on this side?

21:44.136 --> 21:45.512
Make a bit more room, guys.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.474
The two of you will be the team captains.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.977
It's really that simple.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.063
Can we all get started right now?

21:56.106 --> 21:57.190
Thirty-six!

21:57.274 --> 21:58.150
[whistle blows]

21:58.734 --> 22:00.360
-[man 1] Thirty-six!
-[man 2] Set, hut!

22:01.945 --> 22:03.697
-[man 1] Run, run, run!
-Run, run!

22:03.780 --> 22:05.615
-[man 1] Thirty-six!
-[man 2] Set, hut!

22:05.699 --> 22:07.951
I'm open! Jorge! Jorge! Jorge!

22:08.035 --> 22:10.662
[whimsical music playing]

22:10.746 --> 22:13.373
Jorge! Jorge! [groans]

22:13.457 --> 22:14.833
[man 3] Pass the ball!

22:16.376 --> 22:17.544
-Hustle!
-[groans]

22:17.627 --> 22:19.004
[Jorge] Thirty-six! [gasps]

22:19.838 --> 22:20.672
[man 3] I'm open!

22:21.298 --> 22:23.800
[Anita] You caught it, Benjamín! Run! Run!

22:24.468 --> 22:26.428
[panting]

22:27.179 --> 22:28.305
[man 4] Take him down!

22:28.805 --> 22:30.098
[grunting]

22:31.266 --> 22:32.100
[grunts]

22:32.934 --> 22:34.394
-[screams]
-[grunts]

22:34.478 --> 22:35.771
[Anita groans]

22:35.854 --> 22:38.357
[music fades]

22:40.108 --> 22:41.276
[radio static]

22:43.278 --> 22:44.321
[Pepe] Can you hear me?

22:44.404 --> 22:45.489
Can you hear me?

22:45.572 --> 22:46.948
-Yes, yes, Pepe.
-Yes, yes.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.617
-I hear you, Pepe. Yes.
-What'd he say?

22:48.700 --> 22:50.160
We can hear. Yes, we can.

22:50.243 --> 22:51.620
[Pepe] Can you hear me?

22:51.703 --> 22:52.913
-Yes, we can!
-I'll be back.

22:52.996 --> 22:54.081
Quickly!

22:54.164 --> 22:55.749
Oh, we did it!

22:55.832 --> 22:57.834
[whimsical music continues]

23:00.921 --> 23:01.922
[whistles]

23:05.592 --> 23:10.097
SEA STAR

23:15.352 --> 23:16.728
[whistles] Don Claudio!

23:17.354 --> 23:18.188
[man] Claudio!

23:18.271 --> 23:20.524
[Germán] Good morning! Have a good one!

23:36.248 --> 23:37.290
No signal, Doc.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.669
All we have is landlines.

23:42.504 --> 23:43.338
Internet?

23:44.172 --> 23:46.133
-[Mateo] Wi-Fi?
-We've got an Internet café!

23:46.716 --> 23:50.595
[man] But it only works sometimes.
The connection is pretty terrible.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.348
-[Germán whispers] Quiet!
-What?

23:54.391 --> 23:55.684
[man] It's true though.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.603
[Germán] That way,
you can fully connect with nature, Doc.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.907
They're coming! They're coming!

24:10.991 --> 24:11.992
They're coming!

24:12.075 --> 24:13.368
[Anita] Places everyone. Hurry!

24:13.452 --> 24:16.705
[Simón] Quickly! Now.
All the ones in blue to that side!

24:24.463 --> 24:25.505
Oh!

24:29.050 --> 24:30.677
Uy! [laughs]

24:30.760 --> 24:33.305
Oh man! Damn, what a hit!

24:33.388 --> 24:35.098
[Germán laughs]

24:38.185 --> 24:39.019
[Mateo] No!

24:39.895 --> 24:42.272
I can't believe it!
You play football here?

24:42.355 --> 24:45.609
Yes! Yes, it's the official sport
of Santa María.

24:45.692 --> 24:48.320
-You really play football here?
-[Germán] Of course!

24:48.403 --> 24:50.363
It's a tradition.
We even have a league, right?

24:50.447 --> 24:51.281
Yes.

24:51.781 --> 24:52.782
[Mateo] That's weird.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.619
I've never seen
a quarterback stand like that.

24:56.745 --> 24:57.579
A quarterback…

24:58.246 --> 25:00.582
He's the star of the team, you know.

25:00.665 --> 25:04.044
As you can see,
his technique is quite unique, huh?

25:04.127 --> 25:05.962
Man, he's a hell of a player.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.840
[Mateo] Well, it might work
to his advantage.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.217
Can we go there?

25:11.426 --> 25:12.469
-No.
-Sure!

25:12.552 --> 25:14.888
-Yeah? Come on. Yes, let's go!
-[Germán] No.

25:14.971 --> 25:15.931
-But--
-Okay, let's go!

25:16.014 --> 25:17.432
-But--
-Let's just go!

25:17.516 --> 25:19.267
[Germán] Are you dumb?
What the hell, Baches!

25:19.351 --> 25:20.560
-No, I--
-[Germán] Damn it!

25:20.644 --> 25:22.062
[boy] They're coming this way!

25:22.145 --> 25:24.689
-[Anita] Darn.
-They're coming this way.

25:24.773 --> 25:26.608
-They're coming!
-[Simón] Go to your places!

25:26.691 --> 25:28.360
-Okay!
-Everybody, to your positions!

25:28.443 --> 25:30.070
-[Jorge] Thirty-six!
-[man] Set, hut!

25:30.153 --> 25:31.947
Jorge, Jorge!

25:32.030 --> 25:33.198
Pass the ball!

25:34.074 --> 25:35.825
Now run, Benjamín. Run!

25:35.909 --> 25:38.912
-Run, run!
-Run! Run!

25:38.995 --> 25:40.080
Run!

25:44.501 --> 25:48.713
[panting, groaning]

25:49.881 --> 25:50.882
[Mateo] What is he doing?

25:50.966 --> 25:53.051
Whoo! We won! Yeah!

25:53.134 --> 25:54.803
Whoo! We won!

25:54.886 --> 25:57.472
[all screaming, cheering]

25:58.348 --> 26:01.434
Oh, I think he got excited
because the match ended.

26:01.518 --> 26:02.644
We missed it, sorry.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.564
Yay! Well done, team. Yes, yes. Celebrate.

26:05.647 --> 26:06.815
[Germán chuckles]

26:06.898 --> 26:08.984
Hold on. Did both teams win?

26:10.777 --> 26:11.820
The sport won.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.781
End of the season.
Imagine that. Everybody wins.

26:15.323 --> 26:16.366
Really.

26:16.449 --> 26:18.201
[all cheering excitedly]

26:33.133 --> 26:34.843
-[Germán] Careful, Doc.
-[Mateo] Thank you.

26:34.926 --> 26:35.927
[Germán] Let me help you.

26:36.595 --> 26:37.512
There you go.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.265

26:41.891 --> 26:43.602

where you can breathe without fear.

27:09.544 --> 27:10.712

27:16.635 --> 27:19.137
-Thank you.
-Right here, let me introduce to--

27:19.929 --> 27:21.264
-[Germán] Stop!
-[music stops]

27:22.932 --> 27:26.144

What do you think?

27:31.316 --> 27:33.151
-Very pretty.
-This way.

27:34.444 --> 27:35.445
[Mateo] Thank you.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.831
Okay, well, you can get settled in,

27:47.916 --> 27:50.126
and we'll bring you your bags later.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.924
-I appreciate it, Germán.
-Man, no problem.

27:57.384 --> 28:00.428
And if you need anything,
I live right around the corner.

28:03.473 --> 28:06.726
Please make yourself at home. All right.

29:01.281 --> 29:04.117
-[Mateo] Hello?
-[Lucía] Hi, how was your arrival?

29:04.200 --> 29:07.328
[Mateo] I'm beat.
You can't imagine the journey to get here.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.831
[Lucía] And how's the town?

29:10.707 --> 29:11.666
[Mateo] The island?

29:12.584 --> 29:14.502
[scoffs] It's tiny.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.921
[Lucía] I see. And Hernán?

29:18.006 --> 29:18.840
Germán.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.425
Chill.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.387
Very kind but a bit weird.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.182
[Lucía] And how's the house?

29:28.266 --> 29:29.100
The house?

29:32.103 --> 29:33.354
[Mateo] The house is horrible.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.522
[laughs]

29:35.148 --> 29:37.901
It has the most hideous decorations
I've ever seen in my life.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.694
[all laughing]

29:40.653 --> 29:44.532
You have no idea
the picture I'm looking at right now.

29:46.409 --> 29:47.243
[Mateo exhales]

29:47.994 --> 29:50.163
Which picture? What-- It's still up?

29:50.789 --> 29:51.706
You degenerate.

29:52.832 --> 29:53.917
[Mateo] What are you doing?

29:54.542 --> 29:58.129
[Lucía] I'm getting ready to go out.
I'm going to eat at your favorite place.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.130
[sighs]

29:59.839 --> 30:02.175
Baby, I would kill
for a chicken tikka masala.

30:02.717 --> 30:03.968
What did he say?

30:04.052 --> 30:05.303
Chicken tikka masala.

30:06.221 --> 30:09.140
Chicken "ticket" masala.
Hurry, to the kitchen!

30:10.767 --> 30:11.601
But which one?

30:11.684 --> 30:13.102
Which one? The restaurant!

30:13.937 --> 30:14.771
Okay.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.691
Chicken tikka masala!
Chicken tikka masala!

30:18.775 --> 30:21.569
Chicken tikka masala!
Chicken tikka masala!

30:21.653 --> 30:23.655
Chicken tikka masala! Oh.

30:23.738 --> 30:26.741
Chicken tikka masala!
Chicken tikka masala!

30:26.825 --> 30:28.701
[woman gasps] What's up with this kid?

30:28.785 --> 30:31.162
-[man] This kid is crazy!
-Chicken tikka masala!

30:31.246 --> 30:33.540
-Chick a-tic-a what?
-Chicken tikka masala!

30:33.623 --> 30:35.542
It's the doctor's favorite meal!

30:37.418 --> 30:40.171
-[typing]
-[Anita] Chicken tikka masala.

30:42.757 --> 30:44.634
Indian-style chicken.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.312
Hi there.

30:57.105 --> 30:57.939
Hello.

30:58.439 --> 31:02.986
Uh, do you know where
I can find a restaurant?

31:03.069 --> 31:06.114
[chuckles] The restaurant, you mean.

31:06.197 --> 31:09.450
You passed it.
It's all the way back on this street.

31:10.118 --> 31:12.203
-Oh. Okay, thank you.
-Mmm.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.830
My name's Mateo.

31:13.913 --> 31:14.998
I'm Ana.

31:15.081 --> 31:16.249
Nice to meet you, Ana.

31:16.332 --> 31:18.251
-See you around, okay?
-Mm-hmm.

31:21.087 --> 31:23.172
[cheerful music playing]

31:23.256 --> 31:25.508
Any chance
you have something with chicken?

31:27.385 --> 31:29.888
TODAY'S SPECIAL:
CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA

31:31.514 --> 31:33.016
Chicken tikka masala?

31:34.684 --> 31:36.644
In that case,
I'll have one of those, please.

31:41.649 --> 31:44.027
[all murmuring]

31:44.110 --> 31:45.653
[man 1] Nice to have you, Doctor.

31:45.737 --> 31:46.821
[man 2] Welcome.

32:04.088 --> 32:07.133
[Germán] Not too bad for the first day.

32:07.216 --> 32:08.676
Benjamín was right.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.511
There's no better way
for a town to seduce you

32:10.595 --> 32:13.973
than by finding money on the floor
and feeling extremely lucky.

32:17.852 --> 32:20.939
["Black Room" by Los Sustos

32:25.902 --> 32:27.111
Good morning, Mr. Doc.

32:27.987 --> 32:31.199
I shouldn't be here, but I wanted
to welcome you and introduce myself.

32:31.699 --> 32:32.659
I'm Benjamín.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.869
The owner of this house.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.746
Oh! How are you?

32:36.829 --> 32:38.331
-Yes. Yes.
-Pleasure, Benjamín.

32:38.414 --> 32:40.249
Thanks a lot for… for having me.

32:40.333 --> 32:43.920
-Ah.
-You have a very… special house.

32:44.003 --> 32:44.963
[chuckles]

32:46.297 --> 32:47.465
Why's everyone here?

32:49.467 --> 32:51.427
They came for an appointment, Mr. Doc.

32:53.262 --> 32:55.848
Okay. Um, I'll need coffee.

32:56.432 --> 32:57.767
You don't have a coffee machine?

32:57.850 --> 33:00.395
[dishes clattering]

33:02.772 --> 33:05.692
No. I meant the one for making espressos.

33:05.775 --> 33:06.859
Yep, this is it.

33:10.488 --> 33:11.406
[chuckles]

33:13.074 --> 33:17.036
[Mateo] Okay, Mr. Delfino.
Let's take a big breath.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.788
[inhales deeply]

33:18.871 --> 33:20.206
Now exhale.

33:21.457 --> 33:24.002
Very well. Open your mouth, please.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.087
Wider.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.256
A bit more.

-[woman gasps]
-That's it.

33:32.802 --> 33:35.013
-Does it hurt here?
-No, Doctor.

33:37.390 --> 33:39.434
[stomach growling]

33:40.268 --> 33:41.978
I have athlete's foot, Doc.

33:42.061 --> 33:44.689
It's always itching and irritating me.

33:44.772 --> 33:47.066
And, well, it's kind of spreading up.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.611
And now,
it doesn't look like athlete's foot.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.448
I think it's more like
athlete's leg, Doctor.

33:54.073 --> 33:56.784
I'm afraid it's going
to keep on spreading up north.

33:58.828 --> 33:59.746
Know what I mean?

33:59.829 --> 34:00.997
You wanna see?

34:16.888 --> 34:18.639

34:18.723 --> 34:22.101
Give me birth control pills.
That's all I need. Please, Doctor.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.478
I beg you.

-Good afternoon, Anita.
-Hi, Germán.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.159
Listen, I was thinking

34:39.368 --> 34:41.829
the other day I saw
the doctor leaving your house.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.207
Mm-hmm. Your point?

34:44.290 --> 34:45.875
Nothing, nothing.

34:48.044 --> 34:49.170
He ain't half bad.

34:50.088 --> 34:53.674
Honestly, the doctor is
quite a handsome man.

34:54.801 --> 34:55.635
And…

34:57.303 --> 34:58.513
Any chance you like him?

35:00.807 --> 35:03.184
Germán, you know he's engaged.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.019
True, but not even a little bit?

35:05.895 --> 35:07.230
I like being by myself.

35:13.236 --> 35:15.738
[Lucía] Hon, I'm swamped with work.
I don't think I'll make it.

35:15.822 --> 35:18.866
[Mateo] What about the weekend?
I can't take one month without seeing you.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.619
[Lucía] I'm sorry, baby.
But it's not my fault you're stuck there.

35:21.702 --> 35:23.079
[bell rings]

35:23.162 --> 35:25.081
[sighs] I'll call tomorrow, okay?

35:28.584 --> 35:29.710
[Germán] Good morning.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.505
Ah! Look at that!

35:33.131 --> 35:34.799
You're all settled in, Doc.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.677
Very good. Very good.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.012
So, the appointments went well?

35:41.889 --> 35:44.559
At this rate, I won't last a week.

35:49.647 --> 35:54.485
The doctor said he saw
40 patients in a single day.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.738
He doesn't think he'll last a week.

35:58.489 --> 36:02.285
He said he saw things
he had never seen before.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.287
He said, and I quote…

36:07.248 --> 36:11.043
"I had the feeling
of having traveled to the Middle Ages."

36:11.586 --> 36:15.464
The Middle Ages.
That's like, what, 500 years ago, right?

36:15.548 --> 36:17.425
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-[sighs]

36:17.508 --> 36:18.968
Is this your way of charming someone?

36:19.051 --> 36:21.137
[man] Man, I don't know how to do that…

Jorge!

36:30.479 --> 36:32.481

36:33.691 --> 36:35.443
What? You thought it was a good idea

36:35.526 --> 36:38.237
to convince him to stay
by showing him your disgusting fungus?

36:38.321 --> 36:40.823
I just can't take the itchiness.
And the smell.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.074
Enough, damn it!

36:42.783 --> 36:44.035
[Germán sighs]

36:44.118 --> 36:48.706
From now on, I'll be the one deciding
which appointments he'll take.

36:48.789 --> 36:50.208
Are we clear?

36:50.291 --> 36:51.334
-Yes.
-[woman] Yes.

36:52.168 --> 36:54.837
Well, then, who needs one?

36:54.921 --> 36:56.589
[all] Me.

36:56.672 --> 36:58.299
[woman] I need one too.

37:07.099 --> 37:08.142
[Germán] Jorge.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.687
Listen, do you have a minute.
I've been thinking.

37:11.771 --> 37:15.233
Yes, I know. I know.
I won't show my feet to the doctor.

37:15.316 --> 37:18.027
No, it's not that.
You like music, don't you?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.404
-Yes.
-Perfect.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.866
Why don't you put on some rock songs
for the doctor? He'll love that.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.910
Ah. No, man. I hate rock.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.828
My thing is cumbia.

37:27.912 --> 37:32.875
Well, but cumbia, rock, rock, cumbia.
At the end of the day, it's music. Okay.

37:33.459 --> 37:34.460
I'm counting on you.

37:35.002 --> 37:37.630
No. No, no, no! I hate rock, eh!

37:37.713 --> 37:39.757
[Germán] Don't worry.
Don't worry. You'll like it.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.093
It will surprise you. You'll see. Thanks.

[Mateo] I've been here three days.
I can't take it anymore.

I'm going to call my boss
and ask him if I can come back.

38:33.602 --> 38:35.354
-Good morning.
-[Mateo] Yes, good morning.

38:35.438 --> 38:36.814
Where am I calling?

38:36.897 --> 38:38.816
Uh, uh, the hospital.

38:38.899 --> 38:40.109
Oh, good morning.

38:40.192 --> 38:43.612
Can I speak with Dr. Peña, please?
Tell him it's Dr. Mateo Suárez.

38:43.696 --> 38:45.114
Of course, Doctor. Hold, please.

38:46.073 --> 38:48.826
-What do we do? What do we do?
-"What do we do?" Shush!

38:50.745 --> 38:53.331
-Dr. Suárez?
-[Mateo] Yes?

38:53.414 --> 38:55.333
Dr. Peña is very mad at you.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.710
He says you should stop calling him.

38:57.793 --> 39:00.421
Because if you call again,
you'll never be able to return.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.381
Have a nice day, Doctor.

39:27.573 --> 39:28.908
[woman] Good morning, Doctor.

39:28.991 --> 39:31.202
-Good morning, ma'am.
-I've come for a checkup.

39:31.285 --> 39:32.620
Of course. Come on in.

39:34.205 --> 39:37.208
Doctor, you've been bitten by mosquitos.

39:37.291 --> 39:39.877
Yeah. It's bad. Please come in.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.761
Hello? Mr. Hernández?

39:49.261 --> 39:50.137
Yes?

39:51.263 --> 39:54.892
Uh, how are you?
This is… this is Germán. Germán Herrera.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.895
-[Hernández] Wait, who?
-Germán, from Santa María.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.606
The town pitching for the packing company.

40:00.689 --> 40:02.483
Ah, yes. Yes. Yes.

40:02.566 --> 40:05.820
I remember your town's proposal now.
How can I help you, Germán?

40:05.903 --> 40:10.157
Well, I was just calling to tell you
we've managed to hire a doctor

40:10.699 --> 40:12.827
to permanently relocate here.

40:13.828 --> 40:16.038
Um, that's great to hear that, Germán,

40:16.122 --> 40:21.168
but we're gonna build the facility
in Catalina de los Ríos.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.045
They made us a great offer…

40:23.129 --> 40:26.632
We… we can also make you
a great offer, boss.

40:27.133 --> 40:28.551
Uh, look, Germán,

40:29.135 --> 40:32.680
they paid a generous personal guarantee.

40:32.763 --> 40:35.433
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

40:36.475 --> 40:40.062
And exactly how much
was that generous personal guarantee?

40:42.398 --> 40:44.442
Thirty thousand dollars?

40:46.277 --> 40:48.154
They're asking for a bribe!

40:48.237 --> 40:50.448
That's just the way
business works, Benjamín.

40:50.531 --> 40:51.866
[scoffs] It's capitalism.

40:51.949 --> 40:53.409
But that's a lot of money.

40:53.492 --> 40:57.204
But we're gonna get it back.
When we finally sell our fish, right?

40:57.705 --> 40:59.832
I won't be able
to get that amount of money.

40:59.915 --> 41:02.126
It's called a loan, Benjamín.
A business loan.

41:02.209 --> 41:05.379
Germán, my boss won't accept this.

41:05.880 --> 41:09.550
Your boss? Aren't you old enough
to make a decision?

41:09.633 --> 41:13.679
I'm this close to being replaced
by an ATM, okay?

41:13.762 --> 41:15.764
You're already an ATM.

41:15.848 --> 41:16.974
It's obvious!

41:17.057 --> 41:18.225
What are you implying?

41:18.893 --> 41:21.061
I've been managing this bank for 12 years!

41:21.145 --> 41:27.109
And if you could,
please remember that there are cameras.

41:28.444 --> 41:29.528
[groans]

41:30.154 --> 41:33.157
Do you really think
someone ever checks that camera, Benjamín?

41:33.240 --> 41:35.701
Gentlemen, good evening.
What can I do for you?

41:35.784 --> 41:37.661
Benjamín, I'm begging you.

41:37.745 --> 41:38.996
Oh, a business loan!

41:39.079 --> 41:41.916
So, tell me,
what's the amount you'd like to borrow?

41:41.999 --> 41:45.085
-I'm going to kick your ass!
-Simón, calm down. Simón.

41:45.169 --> 41:46.170
Damn it!

41:48.005 --> 41:48.839

41:49.673 --> 41:54.512

to listen to all of his calls…

41:54.595 --> 41:56.263

-Evening, ladies.

41:57.640 --> 42:00.059
-[Anita] Germán, what are you doing here?
-Me?

42:00.559 --> 42:02.394
Wait. What are you
hiding back there, Anita?

42:02.478 --> 42:03.354
Nothing.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.315
Nothing?

42:06.899 --> 42:08.484
You sure? Let me see.

42:08.567 --> 42:12.238
No, it's just what's written there
could hurt your feelings.

42:12.321 --> 42:13.155
[women] Mm-hmm.

42:13.239 --> 42:14.990
[Anita] I really can't show you.

42:15.074 --> 42:18.661
It's very personal information
that we shouldn't use.

42:18.744 --> 42:20.621
Anita, come on.

42:20.704 --> 42:21.664
[Anita] Hmm.

42:24.083 --> 42:27.795
[Anita] When he was a kid,
he lost his brother, and that scarred him.

42:31.131 --> 42:32.633
Oh, well, just like me.

42:32.716 --> 42:33.634
What?

42:34.510 --> 42:36.512
Germán, you still have a brother.

42:37.179 --> 42:39.181
He just moved away to the US.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.475
Well, yeah, but the same thing, no?

42:42.059 --> 42:44.395
Promise us you won't use that information.

42:44.895 --> 42:47.648
-[woman] Deal?
-[Consuelo] You actually believe him?

42:47.731 --> 42:50.734
Anita, make him give you a guarantee.
If he uses it, he has to shave his head.

42:51.527 --> 42:52.403
All right, then.

42:54.029 --> 42:56.031
[soothing music playing]

42:57.157 --> 42:59.201
[Mateo] Have you ever considered
leaving this place?

43:00.578 --> 43:02.496
No, I wouldn't leave Santa María.

43:06.792 --> 43:09.628
If I could just sit here
and fish every single day,

43:10.838 --> 43:12.089
I wouldn't leave either.

43:13.507 --> 43:14.425
[chuckles]

43:22.266 --> 43:23.350
How old are you?

43:24.977 --> 43:25.936
Thirty-three.

43:26.812 --> 43:27.646
Why?

43:30.149 --> 43:31.692
No, it's just… [clears throat]

43:33.319 --> 43:36.113
Well, my brother would be the same age,

43:37.656 --> 43:38.741
but he died.

43:42.328 --> 43:43.370
I'm very sorry.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.168
[Mateo sighs]

43:52.713 --> 43:54.048
I also lost my brother.

43:57.092 --> 43:58.260
He was four years old.

43:59.845 --> 44:01.180
We had an accident, and…

44:04.391 --> 44:06.143
the ambulance took too long.

44:09.938 --> 44:11.148
That's why I'm a doctor.

44:14.485 --> 44:15.861
To be able to save lives.

44:22.409 --> 44:24.244
I don't really talk about this…

44:24.328 --> 44:25.162
[Germán] Hmm.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.207
Me neither.

44:40.803 --> 44:43.389
Is it always this hard to catch something,
or do I just suck?

44:43.472 --> 44:45.641
No, you just need
to practice a little more.

44:46.392 --> 44:47.226
You'll see.

44:47.309 --> 44:48.185
[indistinct chatter]

44:48.268 --> 44:49.645
[Simón] Did you catch anything?

44:50.145 --> 44:51.980
Not yet, but soon enough, right?

44:52.064 --> 44:55.275
[sighs] I'm gonna catch something here
before I leave. Just wait and see.

44:55.359 --> 44:57.236
In honor of our brothers.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.655
Remember, patience.

45:07.955 --> 45:09.456
She gets very nervous.

45:11.125 --> 45:12.710
Yeah. She likes you.

45:13.919 --> 45:15.879
-What?
-She told me.

45:20.884 --> 45:22.928
You really crossed the line, boy.

45:23.929 --> 45:24.763
Sh!

Fake it until you make it.
That's the spirit.

46:30.579 --> 46:32.790

[Mateo] Well, for starters,

47:28.971 --> 47:30.222
I'd kiss your neck.

47:33.058 --> 47:36.520
Then, I'd caress your arms.

-[Lucía] What else?

47:59.001 --> 48:00.586
[Mateo] Then

48:01.795 --> 48:03.380
I'd take out my machine.

48:05.090 --> 48:06.091
His machine?

48:10.178 --> 48:11.889
Oh, tell me already.

We won't tell him.

01:04:26.904 --> 01:04:28.656
-You are very drunk.
-Oh.

01:04:28.739 --> 01:04:30.825
-[Germán laughs]
-[sighs]

01:04:30.908 --> 01:04:32.410
Yes, very drunk.

01:04:35.746 --> 01:04:36.664
[Simón] Rooster!

01:04:36.747 --> 01:04:37.748
[crowing]

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:39.750
[all laughing]

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:48.467
[Mateo] No, no, no, this can't be true!
This can't be true!

01:04:50.177 --> 01:04:54.473
Every fucking time I come here,
I find money!

01:04:57.184 --> 01:04:59.562
-Lucky.
-That's great luck.

01:05:00.354 --> 01:05:01.898
I need some of that luck.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.399
Benjamín.

01:05:04.817 --> 01:05:06.110
Just shut up!

01:05:06.193 --> 01:05:09.614
[all laughing]

01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:10.698
No, no, no, no.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.742
We're all great here.

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.243
It's a great day.

01:05:14.827 --> 01:05:15.661
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.038
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

01:05:17.121 --> 01:05:19.832
No, no. Cheers to Santa María!

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.375
[all] Cheers!

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:23.044
[Germán] World's Heritage Site!

01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:24.337
[Benjamín] Santa María.

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:28.507
The fish bit the hook.

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:32.553
You hear what he said?
"We're doing great here."

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:35.598
He said that.
I can tell he likes money, eh?

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:38.142
It's working.

01:05:38.851 --> 01:05:39.727
No.

01:05:40.686 --> 01:05:41.604
No, no.

01:05:42.521 --> 01:05:45.900
If we ask Mateo to sign now, he'll say no.

01:05:46.525 --> 01:05:48.402
Now is the most difficult part.

01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:51.656
Making the fish bite the hook is easy.

01:05:52.156 --> 01:05:53.407
Convincing it

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:56.953
that life is better here,
that's the tricky part!

01:05:57.036 --> 01:06:02.416
Now, if the fish is convinced,
it will jump by itself into the boat.

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:04.335
By itself, you see.

01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:09.256
What do we do now?

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:18.057
Lencho.

01:06:19.016 --> 01:06:21.060
Are you free for the next two hours?

01:06:22.186 --> 01:06:23.771
[Simón] We'll buy you a mescal.

01:06:25.606 --> 01:06:27.608
[tropical music playing]

01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:32.029
-All right, we should toast.
-Cheers!

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:34.699
-Dr. Salas, welcome to Santa María.
-[all laugh]

01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:42.206
-Hi, Margarita.
-Hi.

01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:43.499
What's up, Jorge?

01:06:43.582 --> 01:06:45.209
Um, could I get a beer, please?

01:06:45.292 --> 01:06:46.293
[Margarita] Yes.

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:48.421
Hey, who is he?

01:06:49.422 --> 01:06:50.715
A doctor.

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:53.092
He's applying to be our permanent doctor.

01:06:53.884 --> 01:06:55.845
I heard he's signing on for five years.

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:57.638
They say he's the best.

01:06:57.722 --> 01:07:00.558
Margarita. Mateo, good to see you.

01:07:00.641 --> 01:07:02.018
Need another round, please.

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:05.146
Hey, I forgot to tell you.
You have tomorrow off.

01:07:05.646 --> 01:07:07.523
Okay? Dr. Salas will cover it.

01:07:08.607 --> 01:07:09.900
-Thank you.
-[Mateo] Okay.

01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:12.194
Hey, so should we go fishing?

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.572
-When? Tomorrow?
-[Mateo] Yeah.

01:07:14.655 --> 01:07:15.781
Yeah, sure.

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:25.124
…thirteen, fourteen, fifteen…

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:28.294
Here he comes.
Here he comes. [clears throat]

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:30.880
Everybody will have a turn.
Be patient. Who's next?

01:07:31.505 --> 01:07:32.423
Nice.

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:34.884
What's up?

01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:36.677
Are you ready to go?

01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:39.096
Man, I forgot. I'm sorry.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.641
I have a hectic day with Dr. Salas,
who's taking appointments here.

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:43.726
Look at the line.

01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:47.104
Ah. Okay.

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.899
-Well, maybe next time.
-Yes.

01:07:49.982 --> 01:07:53.027
[Germán] This time, catching a fish
wouldn't be as easy as the last time.

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:55.154
Sometimes, the end justifies the means.

01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:59.450
The faith of Santa María was in our hands,
and we were in too deep.

01:07:59.533 --> 01:08:02.745
Hello. I'm calling today
because you're rejecting a--

01:08:02.828 --> 01:08:04.205
LOAN APPLICATION
REJECTED

01:08:04.288 --> 01:08:07.208
…a loan I consider to be secure!

01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:10.920
[woman] Benjamín,
I'm looking at the form right now.

01:08:11.003 --> 01:08:12.922
It's in Santa María.

01:08:13.005 --> 01:08:15.341
There's no guarantee whatsoever.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:21.597
Well, if I may,
I've been working 18 years for you. I…

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.933
[woman] Your job right now
is to pay the subsidies.

01:08:24.016 --> 01:08:26.977
It's simple.
That's the only thing we ask from you.

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:30.022
Okay, but I'd like to…

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:31.565
[sighs]

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.734
I don't want to minimize all these years

01:08:33.818 --> 01:08:37.404
but remember, we could replace you…

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:40.199
Don't say it.

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:41.450
…with an ATM.

01:08:41.534 --> 01:08:42.493
You said it.

01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:45.204
[breathing heavily]

01:08:58.801 --> 01:08:59.760
[grunts]

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:06.684
What's that?

01:09:06.767 --> 01:09:08.144
It's our loan.

01:09:09.603 --> 01:09:11.188
Did… did they approve it?

01:09:12.773 --> 01:09:14.900
No, no, no. I approved it.

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:17.111
How? How'd you…

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:19.905
[Benjamín] We have to save
a lot of money to pay it back,

01:09:19.989 --> 01:09:22.241
but the packing company will get us there.

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:24.869
[laughs]

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.580
[Simón] Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:31.625
Germán.

01:09:32.793 --> 01:09:35.296
-[Germán] What is this?
-[Benjamín] It's my résumé.

01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:37.631
I'm going to need a new job soon.

01:09:40.217 --> 01:09:41.051
[chuckles]

01:09:41.635 --> 01:09:43.345
[spluttering]

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:46.182
Thanks a lot, man. Thank you so much!

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.058
[crying with joy]

01:09:49.143 --> 01:09:51.395
[Germán] Thanks a lot, man. [laughing]

01:09:52.271 --> 01:09:54.440
[María] I'm glad everything's working out.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.817
So come back.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.905
I miss you, Germán.

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:05.326
Hey, are you still mad at me?

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.621
-Hello?
-María.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.039
[María] Hmm?

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.208
What are you wearing?

01:10:19.256 --> 01:10:21.759
The red dress you gave me for my birthday.

01:10:22.426 --> 01:10:23.677
And underneath?

01:10:25.971 --> 01:10:26.805
What?

01:10:30.517 --> 01:10:32.728
Underneath, what are you wearing?

01:10:40.778 --> 01:10:42.112
[coin clatters]

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:45.699
-How was it?
-Okay, look.

01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:49.119
Mateo calls Lucía, and she's not home.

01:10:49.203 --> 01:10:50.162
Exactly.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:53.165
[Alba] So he left her a long message.

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:54.333
Yes.

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:56.168
Then he starts talking about feet.

01:10:57.044 --> 01:10:58.504
Don't forget the machine.

01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:00.965
Well, that was a bit confusing.

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:03.467
He also talked about his oil.

01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:05.928
-Okay. Get to the point!
-[Alba] Wait, hold on!

01:11:06.011 --> 01:11:09.890
She was at his best friend's house. Mau.

01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:10.808
Mau.

01:11:11.433 --> 01:11:12.476
His best friend.

01:11:12.559 --> 01:11:14.979
-Best friend!
-Apparently, also hers.

01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:16.939
[chuckles] There's no doubt about it.

01:11:17.022 --> 01:11:22.486
Basically, for the last three years,
she's been cheating on him.

01:11:22.569 --> 01:11:24.280
With his best friend!

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:25.906
[Alba] Mau, three years.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.157
Three years!

01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:28.284
Ooh!

01:11:28.367 --> 01:11:30.995
After finding out, they broke up.

01:11:31.078 --> 01:11:31.954
They broke up?

01:11:32.037 --> 01:11:33.622
They broke up?

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:35.499
-They broke up for real.
-[Germán chuckles]

01:11:35.582 --> 01:11:36.917
There you go!

01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:39.712
He has no reason to stay there.

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:42.214
He can stay here with us!

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.550
That's what we were thinking!

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:45.718
That's right.

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:47.845
Well, cheers!

01:11:47.928 --> 01:11:48.846
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

01:11:48.929 --> 01:11:51.598
-Drinking alone or what?
-No, come on. No way. No way.

01:11:51.682 --> 01:11:53.517
Ay, ay, ay, ay. There you go.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.435
-Okay
-For you.

01:11:54.518 --> 01:11:55.853
Say it now. Cheers.

01:11:55.936 --> 01:11:57.521
[chuckles]

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:04.778
Mateo.

01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:08.615
Tough day or what?

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.827
I broke up with Lucía.

01:12:15.706 --> 01:12:16.874
Why? What happened?

01:12:19.251 --> 01:12:20.753
During all this time…

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:28.635
[sighs]

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:30.637
…with my best friend.

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:32.973
[scoffs]

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:36.560
How could I not realize
they were together?

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.023
My other friends surely knew.

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:42.983
Fucking lies everywhere.

01:12:43.567 --> 01:12:44.401
[scoffs]

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:47.363
-Can you imagine?
-Hmm.

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:50.574
I must have been the butt of the joke
for them this whole time.

01:12:53.118 --> 01:12:54.078
[sniffles]

01:12:55.245 --> 01:12:56.121
[groans]

01:12:59.124 --> 01:13:00.125
[sighs]

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.253
I'm going to bed, Germán.

01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:06.507
Okay, careful.

01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:14.473
[gentle music playing]

01:13:23.607 --> 01:13:24.775
[sighs]

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.279
[Germán] Simón.

01:13:31.156 --> 01:13:32.116
Simón!

01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:47.464
[Germán groans]

01:13:50.134 --> 01:13:51.260
[groans]

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:55.848
[whispers] Simón.

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:58.934
Who are you?

01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:01.895
A ghost.

01:14:02.479 --> 01:14:03.480
[Simón groans]

01:14:04.648 --> 01:14:06.483
It's Germán, idiot.

01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:09.736
I thought so.

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:13.073
He's gonna sign.

01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:19.913
Germán. Good night.

01:14:20.497 --> 01:14:22.207
Good night, Vera.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:23.750
Will you take long?

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:26.253
No, I won't. I'll be brief.

01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:32.092
[Vera] Why don't you and your
conspiracy theories go to your house?

01:14:32.593 --> 01:14:33.594
Simón.

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:38.098
Have you thought of
what will happen after he signs?

01:14:40.267 --> 01:14:45.647
Have you wondered what will happen
when he finds out who we really are?

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.318
That everything's fake.

01:14:51.111 --> 01:14:53.530
That we have been lying to him

01:14:54.198 --> 01:14:55.532
for a month.

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:58.702
A whole month, Simón.

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:02.206
They're white lies.

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.458
But all lies,

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:08.879
white, big ones, it's the same.

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:11.507
They hurt, Simón.

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:19.306
[rooster crowing]

01:15:19.389 --> 01:15:21.517
[Germán] Okay, we have two options.

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:25.562
We drop our elaborate plan
and forget about this great seduction,

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:31.193
or we keep this up every single day
for the next five years

01:15:31.276 --> 01:15:34.738
and continue to be the town
Dr. Mateo thinks we are.

01:15:34.821 --> 01:15:37.950
No! I won't listen to rock for five years.

01:15:39.451 --> 01:15:40.410
What?

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:43.539
I dare all of you
to listen to that loud noise every day!

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.667
Oh, pure Virgin Mary!

01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:48.627
[all] Conceived without sin.

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.631
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't want to interrupt.

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:56.677
-I just-- I didn't know that--
-No, no. Don't worry, Mateo. Don't worry.

01:15:59.763 --> 01:16:01.014
Well, I, um,

01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:03.267
I just wanted…

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:06.353
I wanted to say that,

01:16:07.312 --> 01:16:09.439
even though
it's been hard for me to adapt,

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:11.066
this past month,

01:16:12.192 --> 01:16:16.613
I discovered that, in Santa María,
there's something truly authentic.

01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:19.032
[gentle music playing]

01:16:19.116 --> 01:16:20.325
You're all authentic.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.079
And that's really hard to find.

01:16:26.456 --> 01:16:28.834
I don't need to ask you all
how you're doing.

01:16:29.876 --> 01:16:30.919
You just know.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:33.422
Looking into your eyes

01:16:34.172 --> 01:16:35.799
and your honest smiles.

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:37.926
Transparent.

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:40.012
They are real.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:45.559
That's about it.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:50.689
Um, what I'm saying is, if possible…

01:16:53.066 --> 01:16:55.944
I'd like to be your doctor.

01:17:03.076 --> 01:17:04.161
[Germán sighs]

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:06.163
Thanks a lot, Mateo.

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:08.457
But…

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:13.170
Uh, the thing is, we've

01:17:14.379 --> 01:17:16.173
signed with the other doctor.

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:18.467
[woman murmuring]

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:22.304
[woman whispers] Why did he do that?

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:25.098
Because he cares.

01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:27.267
I'm very sorry.

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.936
I'm really very sorry.

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.773
No, no, I get it.

01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:38.445
Well, uh, I'll be going now.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:47.579
[murmuring]

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.218
[music fades]

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:26.618
I've come to say goodbye.

01:18:27.869 --> 01:18:30.288
[Mateo] I'd have liked
to get to know you better.

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:31.248
[Anita chuckles]

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.963
Germán told me about your feelings.

01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:41.550
How you feel

01:18:42.634 --> 01:18:43.677
about me.

01:18:45.595 --> 01:18:46.972
And how do I feel?

01:18:50.308 --> 01:18:52.477
Germán said you were interested in me.

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:54.896
[Anita sighs, chuckles]

01:18:55.439 --> 01:18:56.398
Germán.

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:02.779
Mateo,

01:19:05.115 --> 01:19:06.116
they're lying.

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:11.621
We're all lying.

01:19:12.873 --> 01:19:16.793
Not everything you've lived here
has been real and honest.

01:19:28.346 --> 01:19:30.390
And the doctor's contract?

01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:34.102
The… the contract?
I… We've already sent it.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:35.812
[Hernández] No, no, I didn't get anything.

01:19:36.313 --> 01:19:37.856
You should have a copy, at least, right?

01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:39.900
Yeah, well, here's the cop--

01:19:42.235 --> 01:19:43.987
[Benjamín whispers]
Someone's looking for you.

01:19:48.742 --> 01:19:50.911
What's a touchdown in American football?

01:19:52.037 --> 01:19:53.538
What? Well, it's--

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:54.790
You have no idea.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:58.710
You lied to me this whole time?

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:01.463
-No, no, Mateo--
-How did Germán's brother die?

01:20:01.546 --> 01:20:04.466
Uh… at childbirth.

01:20:05.258 --> 01:20:06.134
Childbirth?

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:07.093
No?

01:20:07.177 --> 01:20:08.136
Why, Germán?

01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:11.765
Why can't anybody tell me the truth?

01:20:13.683 --> 01:20:15.185
It's true, Mateo. It's true.

01:20:15.268 --> 01:20:17.854
Look, I-- Wait a sec, Mateo.

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:19.272
Just wait. Mateo!

01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:22.442
Mateo!

01:20:23.109 --> 01:20:24.778
Mateo, wait. Mateo, listen to me.

01:20:27.364 --> 01:20:30.116
The soul of this town
has been crushed for years, Mateo.

01:20:31.409 --> 01:20:35.997
As if someone had wrung us.
As if they had drained our essence.

01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:41.545
I mean, my greatest joy is to cash a check
that isn't under my name.

01:20:42.128 --> 01:20:44.130
You know what comes
with that monthly check?

01:20:44.631 --> 01:20:45.590
Pure shame.

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:50.303
Towns like this get forgotten.

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:52.848
They take our fish, our livelihood.

01:20:53.473 --> 01:20:55.809
They take away everything from us.

01:20:57.352 --> 01:20:58.395
The truth is

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:00.939
without a doctor, it's over.

01:21:02.148 --> 01:21:06.611
The reality is I didn't know how
I could get one to help only 120 people.

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:08.822
Did he say 120?

01:21:09.823 --> 01:21:11.074
220.

01:21:11.908 --> 01:21:14.119
I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth,

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:17.581
but it was to save Santa María's life.

01:21:18.081 --> 01:21:20.083
[emotional music playing]

01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:29.509
We don't want a doctor.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.179
We want you, Mateo Suárez.

01:21:51.197 --> 01:21:53.617
[women sobbing]

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:19.851
[intriguing music playing]

01:22:40.330 --> 01:22:41.373
[exhales]

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:49.589
-Is everything all right, Doc?
-Yes, everything's all right.

01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:51.591
[Don Claudio] Where are you headed to?

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:55.679
[Don Claudio] I will stay here.

01:22:57.347 --> 01:22:58.932
The engine broke down.

01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:02.727
Such is life.

01:23:05.355 --> 01:23:06.731
Every day I part from here,

01:23:08.525 --> 01:23:11.820
and I've never stopped
to watch the sun set on the town, man.

01:23:13.446 --> 01:23:14.864
Just look at that beauty!

01:23:16.574 --> 01:23:17.742
Without a doubt,

01:23:18.785 --> 01:23:20.453
when life stops us in our tracks,

01:23:21.788 --> 01:23:24.457
that's when we can see
the true beauty of things.

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:28.628
We take for granted
whatever we think is pretty,

01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:32.590
but we sometimes forget that
the sun shines even behind the clouds.

01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:35.218
Don't you think, Doc?

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:38.430
[gentle music playing]

01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:09.252
What happened?

01:24:10.962 --> 01:24:12.797
You willing to learn American football?

01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:18.219
No.

01:24:22.098 --> 01:24:23.391
[Mateo] Deal.

01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:25.226
I'll be your doctor.

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:27.353
[all cheering]

01:24:27.437 --> 01:24:29.272
[feel-good music playing]

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:33.902
[man 1] Bravo!

01:24:37.363 --> 01:24:38.698
[Germán] Pour him one!

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:43.745
Pour him one!

01:24:43.828 --> 01:24:45.246
[laughter]

01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:48.917
[man 1] The doc!
The doc! The doc! [laughs]

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:51.419
[man 3] Long live the Doc!

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:55.173
["Vivo" by Fobia playing]

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:58.444
SANTA MARÍA FISH-PACKING COMPANY

01:25:58.528 --> 01:26:00.530
[music continues]

01:26:08.746 --> 01:26:11.624
[Germán] The first thing we did
was pay off the bank loan.

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:12.959
Benjamín's name was cleared,

01:26:13.042 --> 01:26:15.545
and Santa María
was forever indebted to him.

01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:21.342
In the end, the fish-packing company
changed our lives for the better.

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:23.928
We have what we rightfully deserve,

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:26.973
and there's enough
to go around for everyone.

01:26:27.974 --> 01:26:29.809
When things seemed bleak,

01:26:29.893 --> 01:26:32.562
and it looked like
we were going to lose it all,

01:26:32.645 --> 01:26:35.023
we banded together as one.

01:26:35.106 --> 01:26:36.149
[all laughing]

01:26:36.232 --> 01:26:38.193
The Santa María way, damn it!

01:26:38.985 --> 01:26:40.737
120 people working together

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:43.489
is worth far more than 1 million
who are at odds with each other.

01:26:43.573 --> 01:26:47.202
Unfortunately for Mateo,
we never played American football again.

01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:48.453
Goal!

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.249
[Germán] With Ana's help,
the school reopened,

01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:57.378
and the children are dreaming of becoming
doctors, engineers, and astronauts.

01:26:57.462 --> 01:26:59.547
-Yeah?
-Yes! He's almost here.

01:27:06.804 --> 01:27:09.724
[Germán] Life in our slice of heaven
once again made sense.

01:27:10.642 --> 01:27:13.895
The new company brought back not only jobs
but family members as well.

01:27:18.399 --> 01:27:20.693
-You haven't changed a bit!
-You too.

01:27:22.195 --> 01:27:24.155
-This is my brother Pablo.
-Hi. [chuckles]

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:25.949
María. It's a pleasure.

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.495
I'm back with my family.

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:37.460
[Germán] At the end of a workday,
when it hurts even to blink,

01:27:38.836 --> 01:27:41.297
I can't explain the joy one feels

01:27:42.215 --> 01:27:43.466
to come back home.

01:27:44.717 --> 01:27:46.386
And despite the long work day,

01:27:47.387 --> 01:27:49.555
I still have energy left for other things.

01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:54.686
We might not be rich,

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:59.649
but I can assure you
that we're happy and feel truly blessed.

01:28:03.194 --> 01:28:07.865
Fishing, job security,
love, family, friends.

01:28:08.366 --> 01:28:10.159
Along with dazzling starry nights

01:28:10.243 --> 01:28:12.620
that illuminate this beautiful town
I call home.

01:28:15.665 --> 01:28:17.583
What more could we ask for?

01:28:18.584 --> 01:28:23.506
THE GREAT SEDUCTION

01:28:24.674 --> 01:28:26.676
