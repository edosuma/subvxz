12:16.110 --> 12:17.027
No way!

12:17.403 --> 12:18.904
-No way!
-[Mike chuckles]

12:19.572 --> 12:20.781
I said no. I...

12:21.532 --> 12:23.909
I'm kidding! I said yes! [shouts]

12:23.993 --> 12:27.830
Oh, my God. We're not old enough
to get married, though.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.540
What? What?

12:30.458 --> 12:31.292
I love you.

12:31.375 --> 12:35.504
Congratulations. Congratulations
and I'm so happy for you.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.174
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.051
-I love you, Mike! My favorite people.
-I love you, Harper!

12:41.969 --> 12:44.388
-I was talking to my mom--
-I'm gonna let you do that.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.975
I just wanna spend my life with you.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.269
-Are you kidding me?
-Oh, my God.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.312
[Mike] I'm so excited.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.208
-[Duncan] Hey, buddy.
-[yelps]

13:13.501 --> 13:15.419
What--? How long have you been there?

13:18.005 --> 13:20.007
You're sitting alone in the dark?

13:25.429 --> 13:26.805
Do you have a guy over?

13:26.889 --> 13:28.807
Why do you always assume
I have a guy over?

13:28.891 --> 13:31.018
Not all gay guys are having sex
all the time.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.395
-Don't you have to teach soon?
-Can't sleep.

13:33.646 --> 13:37.358
I'm setting up this art show for a kid
living at a homeless shelter with his mom.

13:37.441 --> 13:40.361
I think he's good enough to get into
one of those magnet schools.

13:40.444 --> 13:44.990
Today I got a waiter fired for dripping
condensation on Rick's pant leg, so...

13:45.074 --> 13:46.200
I also feel good.

13:46.534 --> 13:51.372
When you get promoted, you can be one of
those rich guys that donates supplies.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.082
So you don't feel so bad.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.960
We love that guy.
We make him a card every year.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.174
-I'll call you later.
-You better.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.885
[door opens then closes]

14:06.262 --> 14:08.931
Technically, this time,
I did have a guy over.

14:22.778 --> 14:26.073
[Dan] Martin's leaving.
He's gonna be a VP at Sequoia Capital.

14:26.156 --> 14:29.118
Serious? He's jumping associate
and right to VP?

14:29.201 --> 14:31.537
It's Rick. He knows everybody there.

14:32.329 --> 14:34.290
If you got his stamp of approval,

14:34.373 --> 14:37.167
-it's the golden ticket.
-Martin's barely 30.

14:37.835 --> 14:41.255
We weren't talking to you, dipshit.
Go get Rick a smoothie.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.090
[both laughing]

14:43.173 --> 14:44.800
I don't get Rick smoothies.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.761
He's on a juice cleanse.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.054
[chattering]

14:51.348 --> 14:54.310
Paying student athletes
is such a hot-button issue.

14:54.393 --> 14:58.606
You couldn't back off? You're implying
we're getting rich off poor kids.

14:58.689 --> 15:03.110
We're not. We're proving it. Your AD
bought a $2-million boat last year.

15:03.193 --> 15:05.279
Your star player is on food stamps.

15:05.362 --> 15:09.658
Kirsten, we are all
a big happy family here.

15:09.742 --> 15:13.120
We've always liked you.
We like what you're doing here,

15:13.203 --> 15:16.624
but don't make a name for yourself
by burning bridges. [chuckles]

15:16.707 --> 15:18.500
I sent you that article as a courtesy.

15:18.584 --> 15:22.463
I'm not changing a word.
I will send you the link when it is live.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.676
-That was incredible. You just feel like--
-Ah-ah.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.761
Where's my lunch?

15:28.844 --> 15:31.805
-I'm gonna get it.
-Tell me something I don't know!

15:34.850 --> 15:36.060
Here are those ETFs.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.686
[cell phone beeps]

15:40.522 --> 15:41.649
[sighs]

15:41.982 --> 15:43.692
-Intern?
-My name's Bo.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.820
-I don't give a shit.
-It has fewer syllables.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.865
Cover Rick's phone. I'm gonna get lunch.
All right?

15:49.949 --> 15:54.328
Don't pee, don't zone out, don't sneeze.
Just cover his phones, try not to exist.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.248
Do not ever, ever connect to his ex-wife.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.251
-Do I tell him if she calls?
-Yeah.

16:01.669 --> 16:05.923
And slather my dick in ink and use it
to write the hieroglyphic for "no."

16:06.256 --> 16:09.760
-I don't know hieroglyphics.
-Sorry. That was over the line.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.470
But no, don't tell him. Go.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.683
Do not put on any more clothes.
I'm coming over.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.101
[Rick shouts, then crashing]

16:17.184 --> 16:18.143
Oh, shit.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.937
[Rick] Someone's ass is fired!

16:22.898 --> 16:25.442
-What happened?
-He's upset about this.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.114
-[Rick] Goddamn you, Kiki!
-This is his ex-wife.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.075
Kiki Otis is--? Oh, that makes sense.

16:33.575 --> 16:35.953
"Spiritual commitment ceremony"?
You showed him this?

16:36.036 --> 16:37.830
You didn't say anything about his mail.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.915
-You have no idea what--
-It's non-legal.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.083
Rick?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.754
What is this?! Bulletproof glass?!

16:48.382 --> 16:49.591
Where's pencil-dick?

16:49.967 --> 16:52.511
-I feel like I'm pencil-dick.
-You're fired.

16:52.594 --> 16:56.515
Charlie, take his work. I don't
wanna see pencil-dick's face again.

16:58.809 --> 17:02.354
Pencils can be all lengths and girths,
so, the joke's on him.

17:04.148 --> 17:07.943
Obviously, you're talented.
You don't have to keep convincing us.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.320
Start by taking out the adjectives.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.365
-Thank you so much.
-Anything for a Dartmouth grad.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.075
It's late. Get out of here.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.705
You are so lucky to work for her.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.416
-I know.
-I reached out to her

17:22.499 --> 17:25.044
through the alumni magazine
and she responded right away.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.879
Now she's gonna be my mentor.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.089
She's amazing.

17:29.506 --> 17:30.382
[chuckles]

17:32.760 --> 17:36.805
Harper, I'm gonna take a nap.
So, just wake me up at midnight.

17:38.057 --> 17:42.144
Oh, but don't startle me. Play a lullaby
then slowly increase the volume.

17:44.021 --> 17:44.855
Okay.

18:00.537 --> 18:01.955
-Hello.
-Holy shit.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.001
Here's your stupid interest. There you go.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.630
What are you still doing here?
Are you like a janitor?

18:11.173 --> 18:12.674
Do I look like a janitor?

18:13.801 --> 18:14.635
No.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.137
I work for Kirsten Stevens.

18:17.221 --> 18:19.807
-Who?
-The sports reporter from ESPN.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.308
Okay.

18:21.391 --> 18:24.394
She got Roger Goodell to admit he'd
seen the video? Don't know her?

18:24.478 --> 18:27.815
She broke the Penguins
concussion protocol story

18:28.315 --> 18:31.944
-that literally changed the NHL.
-But what are you doing here?

18:32.319 --> 18:34.196
I can't leave until she leaves.

18:34.947 --> 18:38.075
And she never leaves,
so, I'm always the last one here.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.952
-I'm the last one here.
-No, you're not.

18:40.035 --> 18:43.664
-Even when Rick's not here, I'm here.
-Kirsten keeps a cot in her office.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.834
Rick keeps a Tempur-Pedic cot
in his office. The Tesla of cots. Kirsten's like if Miss Piggy and Voldemort
had a baby

18:50.212 --> 18:53.674
and that baby had low blood sugar
and hadn't had sex in a year.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.927
Don't talk about babies having sex.
What's wrong with you?

18:58.595 --> 18:59.763
Do you want some?

19:02.516 --> 19:05.894
Rick throws away any liquor
that costs less than $200.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.063
We're at work.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.691
It's almost midnight. Grow up.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.819
It's been so long,
I have the tolerance of a fetus.

19:16.071 --> 19:16.905
[laughing]

19:16.989 --> 19:19.867
[man] <i>It was a tough loss, but we're</i>
<i>putting it behind us. Looking forward.</i>

19:19.950 --> 19:21.910
The third glass is still bad.

19:21.994 --> 19:25.080
<i>If you could watch the ball</i>
<i>as well as you're watching my tits,</i>

19:25.164 --> 19:26.665
<i>you could have made the playoffs.</i>

19:26.748 --> 19:29.376
I wanna have an article
on her site someday.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.795
My God. Will you look at this?

19:34.173 --> 19:37.009
Suze gets invited to cool shit.
I miss all of it.

19:37.092 --> 19:40.304
I miss everything. It's been so long
since I've been to a party.

19:40.929 --> 19:44.474
Or made out with a guy. I don't even
remember how. Like my tongue atrophied.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.729
When my mom was my age, she had me.
I've never had a boyfriend.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.190
But you're a grown-up.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.441
Take that back.

19:53.317 --> 19:57.487
-Not even like a camp boyfriend?
-I'm gonna end up like Kirsten.

19:57.988 --> 19:58.822
[Harper chuckles]

19:58.906 --> 20:03.952
Like buying thousand-dollar throw blankets
and... sleeping with my computer.

20:04.369 --> 20:08.373
That's why she's so mean. She's sleeping
with a laptop. She needs to get laid.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.920
-She needs to be made love to.
-Well, Rick needs to get laid.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.299
The two of them are always in this office.
Let's lock them together

20:17.382 --> 20:19.092
so they can have sex with each other.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.011
[both laughing]

20:21.762 --> 20:24.598
Think about it.
We Cyrano them out of the office.

20:24.681 --> 20:27.476
And then when they're boning, we're free.

20:27.851 --> 20:31.438
Well, I don't need to be free,
I need to be promoted.

20:32.105 --> 20:37.110
All I care about is that I'm not
still an assistant when I'm 28 years old.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.946
That's when it gets really sad.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.740
-I'm 28.
-I'm so sorry. [chuckles]

20:42.074 --> 20:44.910
-For you. That's sad for you.
-You should leave.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.453
Bye.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.051
-I made something.
-What--?

21:01.343 --> 21:03.095
You're so quiet.
You move like a Prius.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.430
-What is that?
-It's a spreadsheet

21:05.931 --> 21:08.058
of everything I know about Kirsten.

21:08.141 --> 21:11.603
-What she likes, doesn't like.
-I have no idea what this is for.

21:13.814 --> 21:14.856
To set them up.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.026
For our Cyrano.

21:18.402 --> 21:22.114
-That was a joke.
-But it doesn't have to be.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.742
-What's Rick's favorite food?
-The filet from Ai Fiori's.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.912
-Where will he be at 3?
-His son's school play.

21:29.454 --> 21:33.208
-Hey, what does he hate?
-"Geoff" spelled with G and sour cream.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.544
We know everything about them.
What they like.

21:35.627 --> 21:39.715
We control their entire schedule.
We are the men behind the curtain.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.550
We can get them to do anything.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.181
-This is very thorough.
-Thank you.

21:49.349 --> 21:50.726
-Absolutely not.
-What?

21:50.809 --> 21:52.102
-I thought--
-This is insane.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.229
I barely have time to do my job.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.066
-If Rick found out, he'd fire me.
-He'd never find out.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.530
-This could save us.
-I gotta take my girlfriend to lunch.

22:04.906 --> 22:07.326
-Should I send this to you?
-Please don't.

22:07.409 --> 22:09.703
["Yankee Doodle" playing on speakers]

22:10.162 --> 22:11.121
Oh, Suze.

22:12.122 --> 22:12.956
Suze.

22:16.501 --> 22:17.669
Mm. Mm.

22:18.712 --> 22:22.674
-I thought we were getting lunch.
-Excuse me. Are those seats taken?

22:23.175 --> 22:24.843
Yeah, sorry. They're taken.

22:25.719 --> 22:26.970
Yeah, I know we were.

22:28.263 --> 22:31.016
Rick needed me to save the seats.
His son's the second lead.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.936
I thought we could do a theater picnic.

22:36.897 --> 22:40.317
Hey, you look amazing.
How'd the, uh, thing go this morning?

22:40.734 --> 22:43.320
Good. I booked that Old Navy campaign.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.197
That is incredible.

22:46.323 --> 22:51.411
Look, I'm gonna be traveling so much
and you're already so busy.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.871
No. I'm not busy.

22:52.954 --> 22:56.583
I don't wanna be with a guy
saving somebody else's seats.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.504
I want the guy whose seats
are being saved, you know?

23:03.006 --> 23:05.133
-I think we should--
-No! [clearing throat]

23:06.593 --> 23:08.136
I know this is annoying...

23:08.595 --> 23:13.141
Ma'am, I would lay my life down for these.
If you can't say the same, move on.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.560
We can make this work.

23:16.353 --> 23:19.481
I'm about to get promoted.
My schedule will be easier.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.234
Then our seats are gonna be saved.

23:22.651 --> 23:23.485
I promise.

23:25.612 --> 23:27.531
-Hey.
-Excuse me.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.033
-[boy] Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.535
I like the beard.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.246
-You got these seats?
-Yeah.

23:34.329 --> 23:37.999
You're gonna have to get me a masseuse.
We're three centimeters from the stage.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.837
What is wrong with you?
I'll mess up my neck.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.551
Oh.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.511
Lot of hot moms here.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.888
Holler.

23:59.312 --> 24:00.147
I'm in.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.192
When they're boning, we're free, right?

24:05.944 --> 24:07.529
Where could they meet?

24:09.156 --> 24:11.700
-Rick's usually at the District Club.
-Okay.

24:11.783 --> 24:15.245
-Could she run into him there?
-Sure. She can run into him.

24:15.537 --> 24:20.167
After she's nominated by two members,
one former member, approved by the board.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.378
Also has a sex change.
Technically, women are allowed.

24:23.461 --> 24:25.589
-I get it.
-Rick cares about winning.

24:25.672 --> 24:28.800
We just gotta make your boss
seem like a business deal

24:29.676 --> 24:30.802
or a softball game.

24:31.052 --> 24:33.763
All Kirsten cares about
is her site, her brand.

24:34.389 --> 24:37.017
-It's like her baby.
-She shouldn't have a real baby.

24:37.100 --> 24:37.934
How dare you.

24:39.477 --> 24:41.396
But I do think that's a huge part of it.

24:43.481 --> 24:48.195
We need a meet cute.
Like, every great romance has a meet cute.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.781
Like, getting stuck in an elevator

It'd be my honor.

37:35.127 --> 37:36.212
Harper, my office.

37:48.307 --> 37:51.602
-I spent the night with a man.
-A man. You spent the night with-- Hmm?

37:51.686 --> 37:55.606
Oh, wow, that's amazing. You get it, girl.

37:55.690 --> 37:59.026
We did not sleep together.
We did everything but.

37:59.902 --> 38:03.781
I'm not the kind of person who sleeps
with people on the first date anymore.

38:04.448 --> 38:06.158
-Right.
-I guess it had been a while.

38:06.242 --> 38:07.368
Longer than I realized.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.955
I don't think they should hear that.

38:13.457 --> 38:15.042
The waiting was almost tantric.

38:16.127 --> 38:16.961
What?

38:18.129 --> 38:19.588
Even when he was being gentle,

38:20.256 --> 38:23.009
I could sense a possibility of strength
in his touch.

38:23.092 --> 38:27.847
Kind of like when Koko was petting
that tiny kitten.

38:28.597 --> 38:32.476
Just like petting it,
petting it, petting it.

38:35.563 --> 38:36.564

38:40.109 --> 38:41.027
Let's bullhorn.

38:46.240 --> 38:50.077
-Okay, tell me something I don't know.
-Yeah, I did not know that.

38:51.329 --> 38:54.874
-Charlie, Kirsten just left.
-So did Rick.

38:55.458 --> 38:56.584
It's daylight.

38:56.667 --> 39:00.379
I know. Okay. I'm getting out of here
before Kirsten comes back,

39:00.463 --> 39:02.590
and this was all
some terrible prank.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.801
I have a date with some guy
that I messaged last night,

39:05.885 --> 39:08.804
-and we're gonna go mini-golfing.
-That's a terrible idea.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.181
Why is that a terrible idea?

39:10.264 --> 39:12.266
You have Dave Matthews'
concentration face.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.144
-No, I don't.
-Mm, I saw you write cursive one time.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.647
Go, have fun. Let him win a few holes.

39:19.148 --> 39:21.442
Excuse me. I only have one hole.

39:21.525 --> 39:24.403
-Oh, my God. I meant at golf.
-So did I.

39:28.657 --> 39:31.035
Hey, you're home before me.
Did you quit?

39:31.118 --> 39:33.037
No, I got off early.

39:33.996 --> 39:35.414
Making Suze some dinner.

39:36.832 --> 39:40.336
So, uh, Suze is coming over. That's nice.

39:41.128 --> 39:43.506
Why did you say it like that?
Why'd your voice go up?

39:43.589 --> 39:46.342
'Cause, you know, she, uh... She sucks.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.387
-What?
-If you take away her face and her boobs,

39:49.470 --> 39:51.138
you realize she's not saying anything.

39:51.806 --> 39:55.267
That's the most heterophobic thing
I've ever heard. You just don't know her.

39:55.351 --> 39:58.396
-How well do you know her?
-I know everything about Suze, all right?

39:58.479 --> 40:00.773
-We talk all the time. I text her all day.
-Like?

40:01.273 --> 40:05.528
She's from Puerto Rico. She's a model.
She uses La Mer products.

40:06.112 --> 40:08.322
She doesn't like dairy. There you go.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.367
All right. Well, what do you do
if you wanna have an intimate,

40:11.450 --> 40:13.119
meaningful conversation with somebody?

40:13.786 --> 40:15.621
-I talk to you.
-That's not what I'm for.

40:15.704 --> 40:18.332
That's what your girlfriend's for.
To be your best friend.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.877
You're my best friend.
I've never pooped at her apartment.

40:21.961 --> 40:25.381
Whose fault is that? Should've did that
the first date. Mark your territory.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.718
[Harper] I barely--
I don't have health insurance,

40:29.802 --> 40:31.846

-Well, Kirsten has the dream job.

40:36.725 --> 40:40.354
-I love Kirsten Stevens. So cool.
-Yeah.

40:40.729 --> 40:44.108
-Wait, what's she like?
-She's--

40:44.191 --> 40:46.944
-Well, she's great. She's great, really.
-Yeah?

40:47.027 --> 40:50.197
She's so smart and hard-working.
Kind of inspiring.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.825
-Inspiring? Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.160
-Here we go.
-Let's do this.

41:02.626 --> 41:05.087
-That didn't go.
-You letting me win to boost my ego?

41:05.171 --> 41:09.091
I wanna destroy you. I'm trying
not to make my concentration face.

41:09.175 --> 41:14.013
Oh, no. Why don't I just stand behind you,
and you can make whatever face you want.

41:14.096 --> 41:16.140

-Why are you still talking?

Oh, [chuckles] okay.
Hello to you, too. Excuse me?

43:30.024 --> 43:33.527
Just tell her to get one.
You're girls. You talk about that.

43:35.070 --> 43:38.532
Oh, right.
I forgot that every morning I walk in,

43:38.616 --> 43:41.994
I hand her her latte,
and then we talk about merkins

43:42.077 --> 43:44.955
and the cyclical popularity
of the full bush.

43:45.039 --> 43:47.416
-What's a merkin?
-It's a pubic hair wig.

43:48.375 --> 43:49.918
A wig for the pube region.

43:50.544 --> 43:53.172
You know, I miss the time
when I didn't know what that was.

43:53.839 --> 43:54.673
There we go.

Oh, uh, okay. Tomorrow morning,
you have that salon appointment.

-What? What salon appointment?
-I mean, the one for the bikini wax.

44:03.932 --> 44:07.645
-Bikini wax, when did I make that?
-You made that ages ago.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.481
Just like an annual checkup,
general upkeep.

44:12.024 --> 44:14.818

-The one you told me to make it at.

-Bliss--

44:20.741 --> 44:23.744
She gonna clear out the brush,
the bush brush.

44:23.827 --> 44:27.665
Clear out the bush and brush
and just make it as smooth as a baby.

44:28.332 --> 44:30.376
To have a baby.
You don't need one of those.

44:30.459 --> 44:32.252
The babies or the bush or the brush.

44:34.338 --> 44:35.297
I have so many calls.

44:37.091 --> 44:40.386
But if we hadn't have intervened,
Rick would have called her too late,

44:40.469 --> 44:43.806
and Kirsten's lack of waxing
would have turned him off,

44:43.889 --> 44:45.641
and there would have never been
a second date.

44:46.308 --> 44:49.728
-Okay.
-We can't just kick them out of the nest,

44:50.145 --> 44:54.191

It's when-- So, if like two assistants
were setting up their boss--

45:15.587 --> 45:19.341
-I don't know what Cyrano is. I know.
-You don't know it. I've said it 14 times.

-[laughing]
-I thought I knew when you said it,

-and then it was too late to ask.
-Okay. It's when a nerdy guy

50:09.214 --> 50:11.758
[waiter] I mean, I saw your phone
not ring.

50:11.842 --> 50:15.345
It's not legally a crime,
but we both know this isn't right.

50:20.934 --> 50:22.269
[Rick yells]

50:25.313 --> 50:29.401
Why do I only have a 2D printer?
What am I, a caveman?

50:30.360 --> 50:34.156
There's too much paper here!
This is the digital age!

50:34.531 --> 50:35.949
[yells]

50:36.742 --> 50:38.243
[cell phone buzzes]

50:39.161 --> 50:41.580
I'll have you know,
my tongue is no longer atrophied.

50:41.663 --> 50:45.208
-Code red, code black, code-- Shit.
-Code red, I can't tell what that means,

50:45.292 --> 50:47.836
-but code shit, I feel like that's bad.
-[Kirsten] Change of plans.

50:47.919 --> 50:48.920
I won't go out of town.

50:49.004 --> 50:52.048
Make sure they know the office
has to be open all weekend.

50:52.132 --> 50:52.966
Um, of course.

50:54.342 --> 50:57.262
-Is everything okay?
-Obviously. Why would you ask me that?

50:57.345 --> 50:58.305
Well, no reason.

51:00.015 --> 51:02.184
I am a successful woman.
I don't need to travel

51:02.267 --> 51:04.853
with a pathetic man-child
who can't even feed himself.

51:04.936 --> 51:05.979
Of course not.

51:08.231 --> 51:10.984
Here's a riddle. Would you tell me
you love Korean barbecue

51:11.067 --> 51:13.361
if you've never had it
and didn't know what it was?

51:13.445 --> 51:14.446
No.

51:14.529 --> 51:18.200
And if we went there, would you refuse
to let me explain how it works,

51:18.283 --> 51:20.911
eat raw meat,
rather than admit you're wrong,

51:20.994 --> 51:23.997
and blame me
when you threw it up on a hot grill?

51:24.080 --> 51:24.915
Never.

51:25.791 --> 51:27.542
Kirsten, do you want your--? No, okay.

51:29.669 --> 51:33.924
A lot of men proposed to me in my 20s.
I could be thrice divorced by now.

51:34.674 --> 51:38.178
But I'm not gonna pretend to let him
teach me about how the world works

51:38.261 --> 51:40.305
just so he can get it up!

51:41.640 --> 51:42.641
He's such a jerk.

51:45.227 --> 51:47.687
I'm worried that your abrasiveness
and general demeanor

51:47.771 --> 51:49.147
will hinder you in the workplace.

51:51.566 --> 51:53.735
You put a plate full of raw beef
in front of me,

51:53.819 --> 51:57.280
I think it's tartare,
and I'm the idiot? [scoffs]

51:57.364 --> 52:01.326
I'm sorry if I expect my food
to be properly cooked

52:01.409 --> 52:05.539
whilst I sit in a restaurant.
What am I, a chef? Uh-uh.

52:06.039 --> 52:09.251
-Do I got a Michelin star?
-You could if you wanted to.

52:09.584 --> 52:12.629
She did this shit on purpose
to make me look stupid.

52:13.421 --> 52:14.589
This was a power play.

52:15.257 --> 52:17.634
I don't think she tried to power play.

52:17.717 --> 52:20.720
Can't get the image of barbecued vomit
out of my head now.

52:22.848 --> 52:25.976
This shitty computer
isn't taking my password.

52:28.603 --> 52:30.564
-That's my--
-Take my password!

52:32.566 --> 52:33.483
[yells]

52:35.151 --> 52:36.027
That's my laptop.

52:37.612 --> 52:38.947
Bring me my laptop.

52:43.118 --> 52:45.036
How could you let them
pick the restaurant?

52:45.120 --> 52:47.539
-It was your turn to choose.
-No, you chose last time.

52:48.915 --> 52:49.749
Damn it.

52:51.001 --> 52:52.544
Rick is worse than before.

52:52.627 --> 52:54.629
-He tried to fire a mailman today.
-My God.

52:54.713 --> 52:58.341
-Mailmen work for the U.S. government.
-Get them together before they kill us.

52:58.425 --> 53:01.303
I can feel it in my bones
that Kirsten is capable of murder.

53:02.012 --> 53:04.973
-[exhales] So, what are we gonna do?
-I don't know.

53:06.266 --> 53:08.059
It's your turn to figure something out.

53:09.102 --> 53:11.396
Why isn't there anything
in my calendar at 2 p.m.?

53:11.479 --> 53:13.690
You know I need a hard out
after family events.

53:13.773 --> 53:16.818
Oh, my. I'm so sorry. I didn't know
that your lunch was with family.

53:16.902 --> 53:19.946
-I'll figure it out right now.
-If I pay you to make my life easier,

53:20.030 --> 53:23.158
but instead, you make it harder,
you're useless to me.

53:23.241 --> 53:24.326
Do you understand?

53:29.956 --> 53:33.126
So, bad news is,
Kirsten ripped me a new one.

53:33.668 --> 53:36.296
Good news is I now have time
to see Golf Guy.

53:36.379 --> 53:39.090
-Mm.
-What is this? Charlie?

53:40.050 --> 53:44.971
-Oh, my God.
-This is Rick's son's science project.

53:46.806 --> 53:50.393
Life gave me lemons,
and I used it to battery-power lemonade.

53:50.894 --> 53:52.979
Can you... fix it?

53:55.190 --> 53:58.610
No. It was a masterpiece,
and now he's not even getting a ribbon.

54:00.320 --> 54:03.156
Go, get out of here. Save yourself.

54:05.116 --> 54:07.285
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

54:12.999 --> 54:15.293
We need a new project.
Whole new thing.

54:16.294 --> 54:18.129
-Yeah.
-What about Golf Guy?

54:18.505 --> 54:21.216
I don't wanna squeeze
my salamander too hard.

54:22.550 --> 54:26.304
I honestly did not know that someone could
do this to lemons with their bare hands.

54:28.848 --> 54:31.768
[Charlie laughing] Rick was so pissed.

54:31.851 --> 54:36.022
Imagine if a duck were on meth,
it was like, "Hey, Charlie. Charlie."

54:36.106 --> 54:39.359
-Sounded like that duck.
-Why do you work for this guy?

54:39.734 --> 54:43.446
-Why don't you just... quit?
-Are you insane?

54:43.863 --> 54:46.658
I've spent three years
doing every shit errand imaginable.

54:47.742 --> 54:48.576
Can't quit.

54:49.828 --> 54:52.789
I'd have to start all over,
and all of this would've been a waste.

54:53.331 --> 54:57.877
Plus, Rick is the most respected VC
of all time, so if he makes me an analyst,

54:57.961 --> 55:00.797
-I can get a job anywhere.
-But do you like the actual work?

55:00.880 --> 55:03.800
Nobody likes the actual work.
That's the job.

55:03.883 --> 55:05.927
Do the best one
where you make the most money.

55:06.011 --> 55:06.845
Hmm.

55:12.100 --> 55:13.685
Okay, why do you work for Kirsten?

55:14.352 --> 55:17.480
I work for Kirsten because I wanna write
the articles that made me cry

55:17.564 --> 55:21.234
when I was a little girl, and Kirsten's
the best sports journalist there is.

55:22.402 --> 55:24.029
Well, has she read any of your stuff?

55:24.696 --> 55:27.949
I haven't written anything
or finished writing anything.

55:28.992 --> 55:31.119
My days are so long
and so exhausting

55:31.202 --> 55:34.873
it's like when I have time,
everything I write is... bad.

55:35.749 --> 55:38.334
-That is probably not true.
-It is true.

55:38.418 --> 55:41.921
I think I wanted to impress her
and I wanted her to like me,

55:43.214 --> 55:47.010
so, it's just like, I worked so hard
at being this great assistant

55:47.719 --> 55:49.471
and making sure she was happy that...

55:51.056 --> 55:55.602
I don't know, feels like I might have lost
any writing skill I ever had.

55:56.519 --> 55:59.689
Well, that is definitely not true.

56:01.983 --> 56:03.318
You're a terrible assistant.

56:03.943 --> 56:05.612
[laughs]

56:07.030 --> 56:08.490
Can you pass me a few of those?

56:15.371 --> 56:16.790
-You ready?
-I'm ready.

56:19.459 --> 56:21.127
-What?
-Yeah.

56:21.211 --> 56:23.379
Holy shit. How does that work?

56:23.463 --> 56:26.091
Well, the bonds in the milk connect
with the DNA in the--

56:26.174 --> 56:28.968
I have no idea. I'm not a scientist.

56:33.807 --> 56:36.935
All the supplies are in the bag.
Feels like a winner.

56:37.852 --> 56:39.813
This isn't as good as the lemons.

56:44.651 --> 56:47.237
[Charlie over phone] <i>He wasn't happy,</i>
<i>but he didn't break anything,</i>

56:47.320 --> 56:50.740
<i>-so, maybe that's an improvement.</i>
-[Harper] <i>Well, technically, he's right,</i>

56:50.824 --> 56:53.034
<i>but given the fact</i>
<i>that we did that in the night,</i>

56:53.118 --> 56:56.371
<i>-Magic Milk should win a Nobel Prize.</i>
-[Rick] Charlie!

56:56.454 --> 56:57.747
Yo!

56:57.831 --> 57:00.375
-Oh, my God. I think Rick's drunk.
<i>-What?</i>

57:00.458 --> 57:01.709
[laughs]

57:02.085 --> 57:05.004
I've never seen him drunk before.
He's violent when he's sober.

57:05.088 --> 57:06.589
<i>-Charlie--?</i>
-[line disconnects]

57:09.134 --> 57:10.885
[humming]

57:13.012 --> 57:14.931
-Yeah.
-Do it with me, white boy.

57:17.308 --> 57:20.228
Yeah. Get over here, you dig it?
Come on, man.

57:21.771 --> 57:22.814
Come on.

57:23.398 --> 57:25.233
[singing] <i>Charlie chicken and grits</i>

57:25.483 --> 57:26.359
Huh!

57:27.527 --> 57:28.528
You don't know that shit.

57:31.072 --> 57:31.948
Um...

57:35.243 --> 57:36.327
You're a good guy.

57:39.581 --> 57:40.582
Do you know that?

57:42.459 --> 57:44.335
-For real.
-What?

57:49.591 --> 57:50.800
I appreciate you.

57:52.677 --> 57:54.929
And I should tell you that more often.

58:00.477 --> 58:03.980
Good idea. Let's have another drink.

58:08.651 --> 58:11.571
-Okay.
-Oh, no. No, no, no. I got it.

58:18.661 --> 58:20.288
I hate losing, Charlie. And she thinks I'm a loser.

58:25.210 --> 58:26.377
What should I do?

58:30.173 --> 58:31.132
You're a person.

58:32.425 --> 58:33.510
What would you do?

58:37.972 --> 58:40.475
-Apologize.
-No. Next.

58:41.267 --> 58:44.479
Tell her she's good at her job.
Tell her you respect what she does.

58:46.397 --> 58:47.607
Just tell her you see her.

58:49.108 --> 58:49.984
Ew.

58:52.153 --> 58:55.031
-What does that even mean?
-I don't know.

58:57.075 --> 59:01.079
I think maybe it's just...
Maybe it's just what I'd wanna hear.

59:02.789 --> 59:03.831
[computer beeps]

59:04.832 --> 59:05.792
Hmm?

59:11.548 --> 59:12.632
[door closes nearby]

59:20.348 --> 59:21.391
Hey.

59:22.934 --> 59:25.019
-What are you doing here?
-[clears throat]

59:25.895 --> 59:26.729
I see you.

59:28.940 --> 59:31.734
What? What does that even mean?

59:32.443 --> 59:33.278
I see you.

59:33.945 --> 59:35.280
"I see you," like--

59:36.573 --> 59:37.657
I see you.

59:41.869 --> 59:42.912
[chuckles]

59:45.039 --> 59:48.042
-Oh. Lock the door.
-Mm-hm.

59:51.379 --> 59:52.380
Yes, ma'am.

59:53.506 --> 59:55.133
I meant that as a joke.

59:56.009 --> 59:56.843
[laughing]

59:56.926 --> 59:57.969
You're the boss.

59:59.762 --> 1:00:01.055
[Rick laughs]

1:00:05.310 --> 1:00:08.104
Let's go to your apartment. I'm serious.
[laughs]

1:00:10.607 --> 1:00:11.441
Rick.

1:00:11.524 --> 1:00:12.650
[both laughing]

1:00:22.201 --> 1:00:23.286
[knock on door]

1:00:23.369 --> 1:00:25.997
-[Harper] Charlie?
-I want rose petals everywhere.

1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:28.374
I need it to look like a massacre
at a flower shop.

1:00:28.958 --> 1:00:31.711
Nantucket is a go. They land in an hour,
I put the champagne

1:00:31.794 --> 1:00:35.298
-on Rick's credit card. Here you go.
-Hotel room is all set.

1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:38.760
-It's about to be Boner City in there.
-Wow, okay.

1:00:39.302 --> 1:00:42.138
Someone say Boner City?
Frigging love that place.

1:00:42.805 --> 1:00:44.932
Harper, this is Duncan. My roommate.

1:00:45.016 --> 1:00:47.101
He's a teacher
at a middle school in the Bronx.

1:00:47.185 --> 1:00:49.604
But he's gay, so,
keep your ovaries in your pants.

1:00:49.687 --> 1:00:52.899
-I'll just shove them back in there.
-[Charlie] What are you--?

1:00:53.483 --> 1:00:56.653
-Why are you dressed like that?
-For Becca's engagement party tonight.

1:00:57.820 --> 1:01:00.239
What are you wearing?
Where are the rest of your shorts?

1:01:01.157 --> 1:01:04.577
These are cool, all right?
Suze likes short shorts on guys.

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:07.121
-Stop.
-[laughing] Your shorts suck.

1:01:07.205 --> 1:01:09.791
You know what, stop it.
You're not friends.

1:01:09.874 --> 1:01:12.210
-I feel like we're becoming friends.
-We're friends.

1:01:12.293 --> 1:01:14.712
-Do you wanna come to this party?
-I don't think so.

1:01:14.796 --> 1:01:17.256
I gotta finish writing this article
to distract myself.

1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:18.675
Distract yourself from what?

1:01:18.758 --> 1:01:21.010
The fact that Golf Guy
hasn't called me in a few days.

1:01:21.678 --> 1:01:24.180
-Like zero contact?
-Yeah, but he'll call me soon,

1:01:24.263 --> 1:01:26.641
'cause he said he was gonna come
to Becca's party tonight.

1:01:27.558 --> 1:01:30.561
-Whatever. It's not like I care.
-It's gonna be fun.

1:01:30.645 --> 1:01:32.438
-Duncan?
-[Duncan] Free booze and hot dogs.

1:01:32.522 --> 1:01:35.733
-You've convinced me. I'll be there.
-Perfect. She's my plus one.

1:01:35.817 --> 1:01:39.320
You're my plus one.
I'm Suze's plus one. You're a plus two.

1:01:39.404 --> 1:01:41.656
-So, she's my plus three.
-I'm his plus three.

1:01:41.739 --> 1:01:42.573
What?

1:01:43.074 --> 1:01:44.325
[cheering]

1:01:46.119 --> 1:01:48.788
[announcer] DJ JC,
kicking it live on the dance floor.

1:01:48.871 --> 1:01:50.164
-Yes!
-Oh, my God.

1:01:50.248 --> 1:01:52.709
-[Charlie] You see all the hot guys?
-[Duncan] Don't do that.

1:01:52.792 --> 1:01:57.296
Everybody's so tan. Oh, my goodness.
Look at you. You look so pretty.

1:01:58.089 --> 1:01:59.632
Duncan, you know Suze.

1:01:59.716 --> 1:02:02.885
I heard you were coming,
and I still showed up, so...

1:02:03.386 --> 1:02:05.179
-Harper.
-I'm Harper.

1:02:05.805 --> 1:02:06.681
-Oh!
-[Harper screams]

1:02:06.764 --> 1:02:09.851
-How are you doing this?
-I get you every time. Yeah.

1:02:09.934 --> 1:02:13.229
Stop. Stop hugging each other.
You are not friends.

1:02:13.312 --> 1:02:14.814
We're killing it.

1:02:21.446 --> 1:02:22.739
Do you guys know each other?

1:02:22.822 --> 1:02:26.159
It's like Battle of the Bulge over here.
It's a war zone.

1:02:37.044 --> 1:02:38.921
-Hey, Charlie.
-He's not gonna call you,

1:02:39.005 --> 1:02:41.632
-and it's not a big deal.
-I slept with him.

1:02:41.716 --> 1:02:44.594
I don't do that with many people.
Thanks, Duncan.

1:02:44.677 --> 1:02:47.513
First guy I ever slept with came out

-We can do that.
-Sunset, St. John's.

1:14:48.817 --> 1:14:50.944
How come you're not writing this down
like Henrietta?

1:14:51.028 --> 1:14:52.488
-What's going on?
-Oh. Um...

1:14:52.571 --> 1:14:53.947
We can make that happen.

1:14:54.031 --> 1:14:56.241
-When do you wanna go?
-Next Saturday.

1:14:56.700 --> 1:14:57.868
Next Saturday?

1:14:58.452 --> 1:14:59.912
That's so soon.

1:14:59.995 --> 1:15:03.123
I'm gonna be gone for so long,
there's gonna be little to do.

1:15:03.207 --> 1:15:05.459
This is a good time to prep that draft

1:15:05.542 --> 1:15:08.086
on the nonagenarians
you were talking about.

1:15:08.170 --> 1:15:10.464
Yes, please. That would be...

1:15:11.215 --> 1:15:12.508
wonderful. [chuckles]

1:15:13.050 --> 1:15:16.053
-Okay.
-And, Charlie, I'm giving you a promotion.

1:15:17.387 --> 1:15:18.222
What?

1:15:18.305 --> 1:15:19.556
So, when we get back,

1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:22.309
you can teach the new bastard
for a few weeks,

1:15:22.392 --> 1:15:25.020
-and bring him up to your level.
-Absolutely.

1:15:25.562 --> 1:15:26.396
Okay.

1:15:28.357 --> 1:15:30.817
-[Rick] We'll make this legal.
-[Kirsten] You're ridiculous.

1:15:30.901 --> 1:15:32.319
[Rick] Give me some of that.

1:15:32.402 --> 1:15:34.363
Now? Are you still here?

1:15:34.446 --> 1:15:35.280
Yeah.

1:15:40.994 --> 1:15:42.079
Oh, my God.

1:15:42.287 --> 1:15:43.622
[Harper laughing]

1:15:46.667 --> 1:15:49.670
All right.
We can work from the District Club today.

1:15:49.753 --> 1:15:50.587
Sir.

1:15:55.384 --> 1:15:58.595
I wanna throw a big party to celebrate,
um, when we're back.

1:15:58.679 --> 1:16:00.305
Invite all the usual girls.

1:16:00.389 --> 1:16:04.685
Maybe we should have a party before
the wedding. What's on my agenda?

1:16:04.768 --> 1:16:07.396
You have Mary's baby shower,
but I canceled that for you.

1:16:07.479 --> 1:16:09.356
-I'll go to that now.
-You will?

1:16:09.439 --> 1:16:11.900
I'll finally have something
they'll wanna talk about.

1:16:14.361 --> 1:16:15.571
Have a seat, Harper.

1:16:15.946 --> 1:16:19.199
[stammers] You and--? Okay.
All right. Sorry.

1:16:19.283 --> 1:16:21.118
I'm gonna give you some advice.

1:16:22.703 --> 1:16:26.331
Men don't wanna date you
when you're beating them to a story.

1:16:26.748 --> 1:16:29.585
But I have met someone
who wants me to be strong.

1:16:29.668 --> 1:16:33.005
And he likes that I'm successful.
He's a goddamn unicorn.

1:16:33.213 --> 1:16:34.339
[chuckles]

1:16:34.798 --> 1:16:36.508
I don't know. It feels like fate.

1:16:38.051 --> 1:16:40.012
-I know that I've been cunty.
-You haven't.

1:16:40.304 --> 1:16:42.889
-Don't be those women that can't say cunt.
-I am not.

1:16:45.726 --> 1:16:48.228
I know I've been cunty.
It's partly because you're young

1:16:48.312 --> 1:16:51.106
and your skin bounces back,
and it annoys me, but...

1:16:51.356 --> 1:16:53.150
it's because I want you to succeed.

1:16:55.027 --> 1:16:56.695
What do you mean?

1:16:57.195 --> 1:16:59.281
I see so much potential in you.

1:16:59.823 --> 1:17:01.950
But you have to have tough skin.

1:17:02.034 --> 1:17:06.872
So, if I'm the most awful person when this
shitstorm of an industry is hard on you,

1:17:06.955 --> 1:17:08.790
I know that you'll be prepared.

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:13.003
MyChef Series A is gonna be
such a disaster.

1:17:13.503 --> 1:17:16.006
We're so smart we didn't invest with them.

1:17:16.214 --> 1:17:17.758
Don't forget to tell Kiki.

1:17:18.216 --> 1:17:21.011
-About MyChef?
-No, dummy. About the wedding.

1:17:21.219 --> 1:17:23.430
And the date. Six weeks before hers.

1:17:23.513 --> 1:17:24.473
Is she invited?

1:17:25.140 --> 1:17:28.477
Send her a big bouquet of daisies.
She hates daisies.

1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:30.103
With a note that says, "Ha, ha.

1:17:30.979 --> 1:17:34.107
I'm gonna beat you to the altar.
But tonight, we're gonna knock boots

1:17:34.191 --> 1:17:35.942
like we did on that Swiss gondola."

1:17:36.026 --> 1:17:37.444
-And, obviously,
-Um, what?

1:17:37.527 --> 1:17:40.489
tell Kirsten I have a meeting
or something tonight.

1:17:43.283 --> 1:17:45.619
Well... I just thought, uh-- I thought you were gonna marry Kirsten.

1:17:49.289 --> 1:17:53.335
Yeah, I am. Which reminds me.
This week, go to a ring spot

1:17:53.418 --> 1:17:56.171
and get a ring so big,
you can see that shit from space.

1:17:58.548 --> 1:17:59.800
Food here sucks.

1:18:03.804 --> 1:18:05.305
Charlie, you did it.

1:18:06.223 --> 1:18:07.641
What? Well, I didn't.

1:18:08.016 --> 1:18:09.643
I did it. We both did it.

1:18:09.893 --> 1:18:11.436
What are we talking about?

1:18:12.896 --> 1:18:17.442
I know this started out selfishly for us,
but we made two people fall in love.

1:18:17.526 --> 1:18:20.028
We made two miserable people happy.

1:18:20.654 --> 1:18:23.532
I thought best-case,
they'd date for a month.

1:18:23.740 --> 1:18:27.703
But they actually really like each other.
We changed their lives.

1:18:28.954 --> 1:18:32.666
I'm proud of us.
I think we did something really good.

1:18:34.501 --> 1:18:35.335
Me, too.

1:18:36.253 --> 1:18:38.755
So, I was looking at
the, uh, Caneel Bay Resort.

1:18:39.131 --> 1:18:41.341
They have a, uh, slot next Saturday.

1:18:50.308 --> 1:18:52.686
Will you come help me pick out the ring?

1:18:52.894 --> 1:18:55.772
Absolutely not. I gotta go to the office,
drop off these things.

1:18:56.231 --> 1:18:58.650
Please? You're better at this than me.

1:18:58.734 --> 1:19:01.862
I need female expertise.
You know what Kirsten likes.

1:19:01.945 --> 1:19:04.781
You're beautiful.
You're charming. You are witty.

1:19:04.865 --> 1:19:06.908
<i>-You are clever--</i>
-Okay, fine. [laughs]

1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:09.411
Yes! Great.
If you're going back to the office,

1:19:09.494 --> 1:19:12.122
can you grab Rick's personal Amex
on my desk?

1:19:14.791 --> 1:19:18.378
[Rick] You gotta warn me if you're gonna
send me photos like that when I'm at work.

1:19:21.757 --> 1:19:24.634
Oh, no, no. Of course I want them.

1:19:25.427 --> 1:19:28.638
I don't wanna show them
to a bunch of Japanese bankers.

1:19:30.390 --> 1:19:31.600
[Rick laughs]

1:19:36.772 --> 1:19:39.733
Okay.
Tonight, you need to wear that red dress.

1:19:40.734 --> 1:19:43.111
Because you look so hot in that dress.

1:19:43.195 --> 1:19:44.780
I can't concentrate.

1:19:45.906 --> 1:19:50.160
[Kiki] <i>Good. I don't work this hard on</i>
<i>this body for it not to be a distraction.</i>

1:19:50.243 --> 1:19:52.829
<i>We're not married anymore.</i>
<i>You can't tell me what to wear.</i>

1:19:52.913 --> 1:19:54.956
Can we try that thing we did
on our honeymoon?

1:20:00.253 --> 1:20:03.298
-You think you could see this from space?
-[laughs] Yes.

1:20:03.381 --> 1:20:05.550
-Hi.
-Oh, is this the lucky lady?

1:20:06.134 --> 1:20:08.553
How do you think Kirsten feels
about blood diamonds?

1:20:08.637 --> 1:20:09.679
Uh...

1:20:10.388 --> 1:20:13.308
Here. It was so weird when I got the card.

1:20:14.351 --> 1:20:16.561
I heard Rick flirting
with somebody on the phone.

1:20:17.270 --> 1:20:20.857
I think Kirsten's in a meeting.
What do you think that was?

1:20:21.274 --> 1:20:23.360
I-- What I think it probably was,

1:20:23.443 --> 1:20:27.906
he likes to leave like a super-sexy
little voicemail for her to listen to.

1:20:28.323 --> 1:20:29.449
And hear later.

1:20:29.699 --> 1:20:30.826
-I...
-Yes.

1:20:30.909 --> 1:20:33.578
think Kirsten likes topaz.
Do you think she likes topaz?

1:20:33.662 --> 1:20:35.789
Sure. Do you think Kiki likes topaz?

1:20:35.872 --> 1:20:38.250
She didn't mention it
when she and Rick were having phone sex.

1:20:41.211 --> 1:20:44.089
-You tricked me. That was entrapment.
-You just admitted it.

1:20:44.422 --> 1:20:47.926
-You lied to me. You knew.
-It's one time. It was a mistake.

1:20:48.009 --> 1:20:50.262
-Doesn't mean anything.
-After everything we did--

1:20:50.345 --> 1:20:53.849
He's confused. He just needed to get it
out of his system before the wedding.

1:20:55.350 --> 1:20:57.769
The wedding?
They can't still get married, Charlie.

1:20:58.019 --> 1:21:01.565
Oh, this is for a wedding.
I actually have a great selection.

1:21:01.648 --> 1:21:03.024
We need one minute. Thank you.

1:21:03.108 --> 1:21:07.070
Harper, we can keep this from her.
We control their phones, e-mails.

1:21:07.445 --> 1:21:09.698
We're the men behind the curtain.
She doesn't have to know.

1:21:13.118 --> 1:21:14.995
You wanna help Rick cheat on Kirsten?

1:21:15.662 --> 1:21:18.498
We have faked their entire relationship.

1:21:18.790 --> 1:21:23.169
Now one thing goes wrong, it's a crime
to suddenly work behind the scenes?

1:21:25.255 --> 1:21:26.089
No.

1:21:28.216 --> 1:21:29.467
It was never okay.

1:21:31.094 --> 1:21:34.764
But now you're willing...
to ruin somebody's life

1:21:35.682 --> 1:21:38.268
just so you can keep dating
some boring girl

1:21:38.351 --> 1:21:40.812
and work longer hours
in a job that does not matter.

1:21:41.021 --> 1:21:43.023
Whose life am I ruining? Theirs?

1:21:43.106 --> 1:21:46.109
-They had no lives. We gave them lives.
-Oh, my God.

1:21:48.403 --> 1:21:50.572
[chuckles] You're worse than Rick.

1:21:51.448 --> 1:21:55.410
Rick is-- He's a selfish,
superficial asshole, but he can't help it.

1:21:55.952 --> 1:21:59.956
You could be a good person,
but you wanna be an asshole.

1:22:00.081 --> 1:22:03.376
You're so obsessed with getting promoted

1:22:03.460 --> 1:22:06.796
and becoming Rick.
You're choosing to be a piece of shit.

1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:08.882
Stop pretending
this is some moral dilemma.

1:22:08.965 --> 1:22:11.676
You are afraid
not to be an assistant anymore.

1:22:11.968 --> 1:22:13.261
That's ridiculous.

1:22:13.345 --> 1:22:15.597
Have you written anything
with all this free time?

1:22:15.847 --> 1:22:18.934
Anything? You finish one article
or you just keep planning to?

1:22:19.601 --> 1:22:22.437
I think you'd rather run around,
getting coffee than sit down,

1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:24.522
write something and find out you suck.

<i>♪ Oh, I can't change</i>
<i>What already happened ♪</i>

1:25:54.524 --> 1:25:57.152
<i>♪ I can only control how I react ♪</i>

1:25:57.235 --> 1:25:59.112
We thought the market cap was overvalued.

1:25:59.195 --> 1:26:01.865
We looked at college towns,
and surprisingly...

1:26:03.366 --> 1:26:05.743
You gotta be better.

1:26:10.039 --> 1:26:11.749
This is not working.

1:26:15.295 --> 1:26:18.381

1:26:23.344 --> 1:26:27.182
Mom, it turns out touring wedding venues
is so much more fun than touring colleges,

1:26:27.265 --> 1:26:30.727
because of all the free food
and booze out--

1:26:30.810 --> 1:26:32.562
Oh, I gotta call you back.

1:26:32.812 --> 1:26:34.147
Oh, my God.

1:26:34.230 --> 1:26:36.816
It is like a tornado hit a Chinese--

1:26:36.900 --> 1:26:38.735
Hey, are you okay?

1:26:38.818 --> 1:26:41.446
Why are you not at work? Harper.

1:26:43.114 --> 1:26:44.741
Because I got fired.

1:26:46.075 --> 1:26:46.910
Really?

1:26:47.911 --> 1:26:49.495
That's amazing.

1:26:49.579 --> 1:26:51.122
Congratulations.

1:26:51.581 --> 1:26:52.415
Right?

1:26:54.834 --> 1:26:55.710
Are you okay?

1:26:56.878 --> 1:26:57.879
[sniffles]

1:26:58.213 --> 1:26:59.839
I spent so much time there.

1:27:00.215 --> 1:27:02.300
And I never wrote a single article.

1:27:03.551 --> 1:27:05.220
Now Kirsten hates me.

1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:08.306
And she'll never help me.

1:27:10.016 --> 1:27:13.645
I'm bad at this.
I've been trying to write the same article

1:27:13.728 --> 1:27:15.897
for months, Becca.

1:27:16.105 --> 1:27:18.233
And it's so bad I can't finish it.

1:27:21.444 --> 1:27:22.820
[sighs]

1:27:26.658 --> 1:27:27.492
Ow!

1:27:27.575 --> 1:27:29.577
Of course
your first draft is gonna be bad.

1:27:29.661 --> 1:27:32.247
It's gonna be terrible.
Then you know what you do, Harper?

1:27:32.330 --> 1:27:34.415
You go back and you make it better.

1:27:34.499 --> 1:27:37.919
But you can't make it better
until you actually do it.

1:27:38.002 --> 1:27:41.798
You're not a bad writer yet.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself

1:27:41.881 --> 1:27:43.633
and just write something bad.

1:27:43.967 --> 1:27:47.804
Yes, Kirsten was mean.
But you learned so much from her.

1:27:47.887 --> 1:27:50.139
You just never had the time to use it.

1:27:50.890 --> 1:27:53.935
And now, bud, you got the time.

1:27:54.018 --> 1:27:57.230
So, get off your bony little ass
and just do it!

1:27:57.313 --> 1:27:58.815
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:27:59.649 --> 1:28:00.733
I'm gonna write...

1:28:01.651 --> 1:28:04.487
the shittiest article ever written.

1:28:04.570 --> 1:28:06.864
Yes. It's gonna suck ass.
I can't wait to read it. Okay. I got this.

1:28:09.325 --> 1:28:11.327
Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay.

1:28:12.287 --> 1:28:14.622
Are you cleaning this up?
Are we gonna hire someone?

1:28:18.835 --> 1:28:22.338
I am not leaving this chair
until I write an entire article.

1:28:23.256 --> 1:28:27.427
-Great. That's great news for me.
-Can I get some free chips and water?

1:28:30.888 --> 1:28:32.557
[Suze] I always wanted to eat here.

1:28:33.016 --> 1:28:36.561
This is where Kim
threw Kanye's half-birthday party.

1:28:37.103 --> 1:28:38.438
Our best table.

1:28:45.278 --> 1:28:46.696
This is exciting.

1:28:55.371 --> 1:28:56.414
Mm.

1:28:58.041 --> 1:28:58.875
Oh, my God.

1:29:00.043 --> 1:29:03.129
This is the best meal I've ever had.

1:29:10.762 --> 1:29:14.474
The best meal I ever had
was a $5 pizza thrown up a fire escape.

1:29:16.476 --> 1:29:17.310
What?

1:29:21.606 --> 1:29:22.565
This sucks.

1:29:23.775 --> 1:29:25.151
This whole place sucks.

1:29:26.402 --> 1:29:28.946
It smells weird. It's far too quiet.

1:29:29.447 --> 1:29:32.492
And this steak is delicious.
It is not worth $70.

1:29:32.950 --> 1:29:36.371
And you and I,
we never talk about anything.

1:29:40.374 --> 1:29:43.544
I don't want to wanna be an asshole.

1:29:44.504 --> 1:29:46.047
You sound insane.

1:29:47.256 --> 1:29:48.466
Just eat your steak.

1:29:53.262 --> 1:29:56.516
If my 15-year-old self would see me now,
he would punch me in the dick.

1:29:58.935 --> 1:30:00.770
I don't wanna do this anymore, Suze.

1:30:01.562 --> 1:30:03.022
But you're my backup.

1:30:04.524 --> 1:30:05.483
Mm.

1:30:09.946 --> 1:30:10.780
You know what?

1:30:11.739 --> 1:30:14.075
Order whatever you want, on me.

1:30:17.161 --> 1:30:20.039
What am I doing? You're not
my girlfriend anymore. Give me that.

1:30:20.123 --> 1:30:21.332
I'm not Rockefeller.

1:30:26.879 --> 1:30:28.714
[cell phone buzzing]

1:30:33.344 --> 1:30:35.346
Harper. You were right.

1:30:35.805 --> 1:30:38.474
We can't let them do this.
I'm going to JFK.

1:30:38.724 --> 1:30:40.143
Meet me at the terminal.

1:30:40.977 --> 1:30:42.145
It's the cheap one.

1:30:43.396 --> 1:30:45.439
Don't have time. Leaving the coat.

1:30:45.982 --> 1:30:48.985
I need a taxi.
I gotta get to the airport right now.

1:30:49.068 --> 1:30:52.655
I gotta stop someone from getting married.
Flight leaves in-- Oh.

1:30:53.197 --> 1:30:54.615
I got, like, four hours.

1:30:55.324 --> 1:30:58.911
And we've been to Times Square. What about
museums? Should we go to the Met?

1:30:58.995 --> 1:31:02.748
Do you like beautiful art that makes you
re-examine what it means to be human?

1:31:03.040 --> 1:31:05.126
-Yeah.
-Then, yeah. The Met's worth it.

1:31:05.209 --> 1:31:08.713
In fact, it may still be open
if you go right-- Oh, my God.

1:31:08.796 --> 1:31:10.756
I did the over-dick-around thing.

1:31:16.012 --> 1:31:16.846
Sorry. Rick?

1:31:25.938 --> 1:31:28.065
Hey. Did I forget something? Yeah. That you're a bastard.

1:31:33.237 --> 1:31:35.781
I don't wanna be like you.
I'm not gonna be.

1:31:36.949 --> 1:31:39.035
I don't want the promotion. I quit.

1:31:41.078 --> 1:31:41.954
Okay.

1:31:42.538 --> 1:31:44.582
Kirsten? Don't marry him.

1:31:45.041 --> 1:31:46.042
[chuckles]

1:31:46.292 --> 1:31:49.670
Do it, honey. Go with the young guy.

1:31:52.215 --> 1:31:53.299
Oh, no. No, no.

1:31:53.382 --> 1:31:55.885
I mean, she's a very handsome woman.
Just--

1:31:56.010 --> 1:31:59.388
-Not what's going on here.
-Charlie. You're fired as fuck.

1:31:59.472 --> 1:32:01.349
I literally just quit.

1:32:01.974 --> 1:32:04.310
Kirsten, I know you don't know me,
but I know you,

1:32:04.393 --> 1:32:06.479
because all Harper does is talk about you.

1:32:07.146 --> 1:32:10.524
And even when she's complaining about you,
she's really complimenting you.

1:32:10.858 --> 1:32:13.277
I know how hard you work
and what a badass you are,

1:32:13.361 --> 1:32:17.657
and I know you don't put up with any shit.
So, don't put up with his.

1:32:18.991 --> 1:32:22.620
I don't know what you think you're getting
out of this, but you deserve better.

1:32:23.246 --> 1:32:24.163
You are better.

1:32:26.457 --> 1:32:29.460
Oh, my God. Gave myself goose bumps.

1:32:29.710 --> 1:32:31.420
He's crazy. You realize that?

1:32:32.296 --> 1:32:33.130
Hmm?

1:32:36.634 --> 1:32:37.843
What's my favorite food?

1:32:39.971 --> 1:32:42.348
Your favorite-- It's steak tartare.

1:32:43.099 --> 1:32:45.351
It's green curry, you douche-tard.

1:32:45.434 --> 1:32:48.771
She likes it medium-spicy
from Thai Leaf on Broadway.

1:32:49.897 --> 1:32:51.399
What's my favorite place?

1:32:52.525 --> 1:32:54.402
Kiki, I ca-- [clears throat]

1:32:54.485 --> 1:32:55.653
This is ridiculous.

1:32:56.112 --> 1:32:56.946
Why are we--? Kirsten.

1:33:00.241 --> 1:33:01.492
Your name is Kirsten.

1:33:02.410 --> 1:33:04.912
Squam Lake, New Hampshire,
you douche-tard.

1:33:06.080 --> 1:33:08.332
Charlie,
I know you're no longer his assistant,

1:33:08.416 --> 1:33:10.960
but could you please strike "wedding"
from his calendar?

1:33:11.335 --> 1:33:12.670
Absolutely.

1:33:13.713 --> 1:33:15.047
Are you being serious?

1:33:16.340 --> 1:33:18.175
No. Kiki's short for Kirsten.

1:33:38.779 --> 1:33:39.697
I finished.

1:33:41.574 --> 1:33:42.658
I finished. The whole article.

1:33:45.828 --> 1:33:47.413
I finished it.

1:33:47.496 --> 1:33:49.332
From beginning to end.

1:33:50.583 --> 1:33:53.085
I finished it. I finished the whole thing.

1:33:53.169 --> 1:33:55.463
You, sir, are a hero and scholar,

1:33:55.546 --> 1:33:58.883
and are about to receive the greatest tip
in the history of the service industry.

1:34:02.178 --> 1:34:05.264
Technically, I don't have my wallet on me.
Tomorrow--

1:34:05.348 --> 1:34:07.350
Leave this place and never return.

1:34:11.562 --> 1:34:12.772
[whispers] I did it.

1:34:15.149 --> 1:34:16.400
[knock on door]

1:34:19.320 --> 1:34:20.237
Hey.

1:34:20.696 --> 1:34:22.907
-What do you want?
-You live here?

1:34:24.867 --> 1:34:25.993
It's disgusting.

1:34:26.702 --> 1:34:28.245
Hold up. Hold up, hold up.

1:34:28.621 --> 1:34:29.872
I'm sorry. I just--

1:34:29.955 --> 1:34:30.831
I, uh...

1:34:31.624 --> 1:34:34.960
I need some information on, uh, my wife.
My ex-wife.

1:34:35.294 --> 1:34:36.253
Like what?

1:34:37.213 --> 1:34:38.297
Uh...

1:34:38.589 --> 1:34:41.717
I got some written down here.
Uh, assorted favorites,

1:34:41.801 --> 1:34:43.844
as in, uh, favorite foods,

1:34:43.928 --> 1:34:47.014
-flowers, clothing--
-Are you serious?

1:34:47.723 --> 1:34:51.477
Look, I realize I should know this.
But you used to do all this stuff for me.

1:34:56.190 --> 1:34:57.316
I want her back.

1:35:00.611 --> 1:35:02.029
I have an old Kiki file.

1:35:02.988 --> 1:35:04.573
-I'll send it over to you.
-[exhales]

1:35:05.741 --> 1:35:06.992
Thank you. Thank you.

1:35:07.493 --> 1:35:08.536
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

1:35:09.245 --> 1:35:11.372
-I really appreciate this.
-Rick.

1:35:11.831 --> 1:35:13.999
-You still work for this guy?
-Nope.

1:35:16.961 --> 1:35:19.088
It's soy. Nice seeing you, Rick.

1:35:21.048 --> 1:35:21.882
[Charlie] Bye, Rick.

1:35:39.024 --> 1:35:40.151
-Hi.
-Oh.

1:35:40.860 --> 1:35:42.194
Thank God you're here.

1:35:42.278 --> 1:35:45.823
I can't find that piece
on lesbian soccer players in Nigeria.

1:35:46.407 --> 1:35:48.492
Probably in your "deleted" folder.

1:35:48.576 --> 1:35:50.828
-I can't find Julie's number.
-You made me change it

1:35:50.911 --> 1:35:53.414
-to Satan in your contacts.
-Come back to work.

1:35:54.081 --> 1:35:54.915
What?

1:35:54.999 --> 1:35:59.003
You crossed every line ever.
I genuinely considered setting you up

1:35:59.086 --> 1:36:01.714
for white-collar crime
and just letting you rot in jail.

1:36:04.008 --> 1:36:06.635
But I understand in some ways
what you were trying to do.

1:36:06.719 --> 1:36:08.846
You're not an unintelligent person.

1:36:09.054 --> 1:36:12.266
I don't know how you did all this.
This place is falling apart without you.

1:36:16.145 --> 1:36:17.897
Come back and do it with me.

1:36:19.148 --> 1:36:20.858
I learned so much from you.

1:36:23.277 --> 1:36:24.236
You're my hero.

1:36:28.699 --> 1:36:33.412
But if I wanna actually be a writer, I
have to stop making excuses not to write.

1:36:35.664 --> 1:36:37.458
So, I can't be your assistant.

1:36:38.834 --> 1:36:40.377
But I'd love to help you find a new one.

1:36:42.671 --> 1:36:43.797
You're fired again.

1:36:44.215 --> 1:36:47.843
-I have to get my stuff. This is awkward.
-Have you written anything?

1:36:48.385 --> 1:36:50.888
Have I written anything? Yes.
I have written something.

1:36:50.971 --> 1:36:53.265
It's just-- It's right here.

1:36:54.225 --> 1:36:55.434
Let's go over it.

1:36:56.101 --> 1:36:59.438
-Tell me something I don't know.
-Okay.

1:37:02.483 --> 1:37:05.319
-"Twilight Champions."
-Yeah, but that title is--

1:37:05.402 --> 1:37:09.323
-No, I like it. I love the title.
-I like it, too. I could like it.

1:37:09.406 --> 1:37:11.742
This is about the geriatric Olympiads?

1:37:12.493 --> 1:37:14.787
If I spend too much time
on Gilda in the beginning,

1:37:14.870 --> 1:37:18.582
people will know that she's gonna die.
Let her death be a twist.

1:37:19.166 --> 1:37:21.877
Hold off until
after Harry wins his first med--

1:37:49.113 --> 1:37:49.947
Hi. Hi.

1:37:54.326 --> 1:37:56.036
So, what are you doing here?

1:37:56.120 --> 1:37:59.540
Oh, Kirsten told me to meet her.
What are you doing here?

1:38:02.001 --> 1:38:03.877
Oh, my God.

1:38:05.838 --> 1:38:07.506
-She Cyrano'd us.
-Yes, she--

1:38:08.215 --> 1:38:10.718
I Googled it.
So, I know what it means now.

1:38:13.971 --> 1:38:15.264
Why are you dressed like that?

1:38:16.307 --> 1:38:19.268
I don't work here anymore.
I quit working for Rick.

1:38:21.186 --> 1:38:23.355
Starting over. At 28.

1:38:24.481 --> 1:38:27.651
Actually, I'm a temp,
which is technically lower

1:38:27.735 --> 1:38:31.989
on the totem pole than an assistant,
which is kind of a kick in the nuts.

1:38:33.490 --> 1:38:38.245
But it's, um, kind of cool.
I get to see a bunch of different jobs.

1:38:39.455 --> 1:38:41.248
Find out what I actually like.

1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:43.834
I like you.

1:38:45.961 --> 1:38:47.046
So, so much.

1:38:49.590 --> 1:38:51.383
You're not hard to get at all.

1:38:52.551 --> 1:38:53.761
You're hard to earn.

1:38:54.887 --> 1:38:56.639
It's so much better.

1:40:37.865 --> 1:40:38.991
I feel joy.

1:40:41.744 --> 1:40:44.580
Maybe I love love in open spaces, too.
