00:00.469 --> 00:03.769
Please, don't try anything
you're about to see at home.

00:03.794 --> 00:06.094
We're what you call "experts."

00:09.119 --> 00:11.219
On this episode of MythBusters...

00:11.244 --> 00:12.544
- Dear MythBusters...
- Dear MythBusters...

00:12.568 --> 00:13.369
Dear MythBusters...

00:13.394 --> 00:15.594
...it's the Mailbag Special...

00:15.619 --> 00:16.819
To the bomb range.

00:16.844 --> 00:20.744
...as Tory, Grant and Kari
answer your questions...

00:20.769 --> 00:21.969
- That is correct!
- Whoo!

00:21.994 --> 00:24.394
...criticisms, and concerns.

00:24.419 --> 00:26.719
You asked, we're delivering.

00:26.744 --> 00:29.644
Your mini-myths are tackled and tested.

00:29.669 --> 00:31.569
Just remember, aim for the melons.

00:31.594 --> 00:34.494
There are exclusive
behind the scenes... scenes...

00:34.519 --> 00:35.419
Hello.

00:35.444 --> 00:38.744
...and in world firsts,
unseen footage is unearthed.

00:38.769 --> 00:41.369
These are hot.

00:41.394 --> 00:45.694
So, strap in for a wild ride,
because you are in charge.

00:46.219 --> 00:47.119
In three...

00:47.144 --> 00:47.844
two...

00:47.869 --> 00:48.769
one...

00:48.994 --> 00:50.894
- Whoo!
- Whooooooo!

00:53.819 --> 00:56.219
Who are the MythBusters?

00:56.669 --> 00:57.769
Adam Savage...

00:57.771 --> 00:59.371
It's scientific!

00:59.373 --> 01:01.206
and Jamie Hyneman.

01:01.208 --> 01:03.441
Jamie wants big boom.

01:03.443 --> 01:07.879
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:07.881 --> 01:09.514
Together with Kari Byron...

01:09.516 --> 01:11.916
Science gets more fun
when I get a bigger gun.

01:11.918 --> 01:14.386
- Tory Belleci...
- We survived!

01:14.388 --> 01:15.887
and Grant Imahara.

01:15.889 --> 01:17.088
Start the car!

01:17.090 --> 01:19.557
They don't just tell the myths.

01:19.559 --> 01:22.127
They put them to the test.

01:22.129 --> 01:26.529
MythBusters 10x09 - Mailbag Special
Original air date May 20, 2012

01:26.554 --> 01:30.954
Sync and corrections by atrn97g
for www.addic7ed.com

01:30.970 --> 01:32.971
Okay, so we're not in the blueprint room,

01:32.973 --> 01:35.740
and we are surrounded...
I mean surrounded... by mail.

01:35.742 --> 01:38.443
This is the Kari/Tory/Grant
Mailbag Special,

01:38.445 --> 01:39.744
and this is the mail.

01:43.483 --> 01:45.683
I come from the planet Butt Head.

01:45.685 --> 01:47.185
But we've also gone through

01:47.187 --> 01:50.522
and found all the concerns,
questions, myths, criticisms

01:50.524 --> 01:51.856
from all of our fans.

01:51.858 --> 01:53.725
And we're gonna open up as many as we can

01:53.727 --> 01:55.326
and answer them as best as we can.

01:56.696 --> 01:58.963
Give it a spin.

01:58.965 --> 02:00.965
Mythbuster history is littered with letters

02:00.967 --> 02:04.169
suggesting stories and revisit ideas.

02:04.171 --> 02:05.370
All right.

02:05.372 --> 02:07.138
Pick one.

02:07.140 --> 02:08.973
And the mailbag here at H.Q.

02:08.975 --> 02:10.675
fills as fast as we can empty it.

02:10.676 --> 02:12.343
Yeah, my inbox is stuffed.

02:12.345 --> 02:14.412
But this time, the team will tackle

02:14.414 --> 02:16.981
every letter's suggestion,
not just the myths,

02:16.983 --> 02:19.517
which means they're in your hands.

02:19.519 --> 02:21.653
And things are about to get crazy.

02:21.655 --> 02:23.488
You know what? I found a letter.

02:23.490 --> 02:25.490
"Adam and Jamie said,
'better to end with a bang.'"

02:28.094 --> 02:30.628
"Can you <i>start</i> with a bang?"

02:30.630 --> 02:32.297
"Can you blow up an office cubicle?"

02:32.299 --> 02:34.766
- I like it!
- To the bomb range.

02:36.502 --> 02:38.536
Okay.

02:38.538 --> 02:40.538
So, the first out-of-left-field letter

02:40.540 --> 02:42.140
is to assemble

02:42.142 --> 02:45.677
and then, with explosives,
disassemble an office cubicle.

02:45.679 --> 02:49.047
In a parallel universe
in the early '90s...

02:50.450 --> 02:52.851
this is where I'd be...
accounts receivable.

02:52.853 --> 02:54.519
Can we start
with a bang, you ask?

02:54.521 --> 02:57.055
Well, the answer is, "yes. Yes, we can."

02:57.057 --> 02:59.090
And the man in charge of the charge

02:59.092 --> 03:01.259
is honorary mythbuster Frank Doyle.

03:01.261 --> 03:06.431
We have taken a M112 block of C-4,

03:06.433 --> 03:08.399
which is about one pound,

03:08.401 --> 03:10.668
and then we will be command-detonating it

03:10.670 --> 03:11.836
from a distance away.

03:13.472 --> 03:15.773
With the blast shield in place,

03:15.775 --> 03:17.308
it's all systems "blow."

03:17.310 --> 03:18.443
All right.

03:18.445 --> 03:19.644
So, this is the viewer request

03:19.646 --> 03:21.012
"is it better to start with a bang?"

03:21.014 --> 03:23.882
In 3...2...1...

03:23.884 --> 03:25.984
Fire.

03:25.986 --> 03:27.285
Whoo!

03:31.590 --> 03:33.458
Well, that confirms it.

03:33.460 --> 03:35.627
A quick bang is the perfect hors d'oeuvre

03:35.629 --> 03:37.095
for the mailbag main course

03:37.097 --> 03:39.230
definitely good to start with a bang.

03:39.232 --> 03:41.132
Hopefully the next letter
actually has a myth in it.

03:41.134 --> 03:43.434
- Oh, I don't mind.
- I know.

03:43.436 --> 03:46.838
All right. Next letter.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.240
"Dear MythBusters, is it really true"

03:49.242 --> 03:52.443
"that it's impossible to eat
a spoonful of cinnamon"

03:52.445 --> 03:54.012
"without drinking water?"

03:54.014 --> 03:55.847
Okay, I am <i>not</i> into this one.

03:55.849 --> 03:57.815
I mean, cinnamon is not only an irritant,

03:57.817 --> 03:59.684
but it's also hydrophilic.

03:59.686 --> 04:01.419
It absorbs water like crazy.

04:01.421 --> 04:03.955
So, consequently, wouldn't it be
virtually impossible

04:03.957 --> 04:05.757
to eat a spoonful without drinking?

04:05.759 --> 04:07.659
Well, there's only one way to find out.

04:07.661 --> 04:09.928
Let's set up on the shop floor
and give it a try.

04:11.231 --> 04:13.298
It's a dangerous
Internet phenomenon.

04:13.300 --> 04:16.100
To spoon a mouthful of cinnamon
without water

04:16.101 --> 04:19.103
is supposedly impossible
and definitely painful.

04:19.105 --> 04:21.706
It's already sent scores
of people to the hospital.

04:21.708 --> 04:26.377
So, with a medic standing by,
the team gets set to swallow.

04:26.379 --> 04:28.580
Now, maybe you're thinking,
"spoonful of cinnamon?"

04:28.582 --> 04:30.481
"What's so dangerous about that?"

04:30.483 --> 04:32.217
Well, because it's hydrophilic,

04:32.219 --> 04:34.786
it dries up your saliva instantly,

04:34.788 --> 04:36.788
which can cause coughing and vomiting.

04:36.790 --> 04:38.690
Plus, if you accidentally inhale it,

04:38.692 --> 04:40.592
it can cause breathing difficulties,

04:40.594 --> 04:42.727
throat irritation, and even pneumonia.

04:44.096 --> 04:45.697
Kari's first up.

04:45.699 --> 04:47.732
I've never seen you hesitate so...

04:52.204 --> 04:53.504
Aah! Not on me!

04:53.506 --> 04:54.973
Holy crap!

04:54.975 --> 04:56.407
You want some water?

04:59.078 --> 05:00.211
Is sh...

05:00.213 --> 05:01.579
You okay?

05:01.581 --> 05:03.615
Yeah. That was great.

05:03.617 --> 05:05.850
Not only could Kari not swallow,

05:05.852 --> 05:07.819
but her near-choking fit illustrates

05:07.821 --> 05:09.354
that this is <i>not</i> child's play.

05:09.356 --> 05:11.322
For a second there,
I couldn't breathe.

05:11.324 --> 05:12.690
In fact...

05:12.692 --> 05:16.094
You know the uvula
that causes the gag reflex?

05:16.096 --> 05:19.063
It's actually cinnamon-coated right now.

05:22.302 --> 05:24.369
I shouldn't be laughing this hard,

05:24.371 --> 05:25.737
but, man, that's funny.

05:25.739 --> 05:27.939
Oh, laugh now, Tory.

05:27.941 --> 05:29.307
Your turn will come.

05:29.309 --> 05:30.508
But first, it's Grant...

05:30.510 --> 05:31.743
Seriously?

05:31.745 --> 05:33.144
who's taking a moment

05:33.146 --> 05:36.447
to steel his famously
not-so-steely stomach.

05:39.718 --> 05:41.152
Okay. Ready?

05:41.154 --> 05:43.021
I'll be so impressed if you can do this.

05:43.023 --> 05:44.088
Yeah, you can.

05:44.090 --> 05:45.823
Look at that.

05:47.026 --> 05:49.761
Kind of meditating and, like,
trying to put saliva into it.

05:49.763 --> 05:51.963
No, I think he's trying to
go to the bathroom.

05:55.402 --> 05:56.734
Oh, man, did I look like that?

05:56.736 --> 05:57.902
No.

05:57.904 --> 05:59.370
Oh, God.

05:59.372 --> 06:01.172
I think he's going to his unhappy place.

06:05.178 --> 06:07.145
My strategy was to keep it in my mouth

06:07.147 --> 06:10.448
and try and just build up
the saliva, build up the saliva.

06:10.450 --> 06:13.785
But it's just too much.
It's too much cinnamon.

06:13.787 --> 06:15.653
Maybe it would be possible

06:15.655 --> 06:18.690
with half that amount or 1/4 that amount,

06:18.692 --> 06:22.193
but a tablespoon full... you can't do it.

06:22.195 --> 06:23.494
All right.

06:23.496 --> 06:25.029
Tory is about to find out for sure,

06:25.031 --> 06:27.398
and he does have the slight advantage

06:27.400 --> 06:30.068
of seeing two failed strategies in action.

06:30.070 --> 06:32.136
Oh, look at that. Into the cheek.

06:32.138 --> 06:33.771
Chewing-tobacco style.

06:33.773 --> 06:35.673
He's doing good so far.

06:35.675 --> 06:37.108
He really is.

06:37.110 --> 06:40.078
Tory has squirreled
the cinnamon into his cheeks

06:40.080 --> 06:42.347
and is trying to work up
the saliva he needs

06:42.349 --> 06:44.982
to overcome its absorbent qualities.

06:44.984 --> 06:46.684
But can he go the distance?

06:46.686 --> 06:47.852
Still going strong.

06:47.854 --> 06:50.088
He's like at least a minute in.

06:50.090 --> 06:51.089
Mm-hmm.

06:51.091 --> 06:52.323
- It hurts?
- Mm.

06:52.325 --> 06:53.524
- It hurts a lot.
- Mm-hmm.

06:53.526 --> 06:55.693
Despite the discomfort, Tory keeps going.

06:55.695 --> 06:57.695
I think I got this one beat.

06:57.697 --> 06:59.063
But <i>you</i> shouldn't.

06:59.065 --> 07:01.933
This is definitely one to <i>not</i> try at home.

07:01.935 --> 07:03.868
Oh, my God.

07:03.870 --> 07:05.436
- You're swallowing it.
- Mm.

07:07.072 --> 07:08.206
Whoo!

07:08.208 --> 07:09.340
I did it.

07:09.342 --> 07:11.175
- Hey!
- Yes!

07:11.177 --> 07:12.210
Busted!

07:12.212 --> 07:14.312
So, it turns out this one is busted.

07:14.314 --> 07:17.982
You can eat a spoonful of
cinnamon without drinking water,

07:17.984 --> 07:20.318
but whatever you do,
do not try this at home.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.619
Seriously.

07:21.621 --> 07:23.554
Not only is it painful,
it is also very dangerous.

07:23.556 --> 07:26.424
In fact, hundreds of kids
have ended up in the hospital

07:26.426 --> 07:28.493
attempting to do what we just did.

07:28.495 --> 07:30.962
Not only that,
we had a doctor standing by.

07:30.964 --> 07:33.297
Plus, we had to get a medical examination

07:33.299 --> 07:34.999
before and after the experiment.

07:35.001 --> 07:37.034
Seriously, this is bad news.

07:37.036 --> 07:39.771
Looks like I win and lose
at the same time.

07:39.773 --> 07:41.406
Congratulations.

07:47.513 --> 07:50.615
"Dear MythBusters, who does
your blueprint drawings?"

07:50.617 --> 07:52.083
That's easy. Our own Eric Haven.

07:52.085 --> 07:53.718
He's one of our associate producers.

07:53.720 --> 07:54.919
All right. Next question.

07:54.921 --> 07:56.187
I think our viewers deserve

07:56.189 --> 07:57.822
a little more of an answer than that.

07:59.491 --> 08:01.426
Yep, not a week goes by

08:01.428 --> 08:03.261
when the mailbag
isn't filled with questions

08:03.263 --> 08:06.164
about this international man of mystery.

08:06.166 --> 08:08.733
How many years do you think
you've been doing pushups?

08:08.735 --> 08:10.868
I don't know. Are my pecs distracting you?

08:10.870 --> 08:13.204
Who is this bespectacled sex God

08:13.206 --> 08:15.740
with the impeccable penmanship, you ask?

08:17.177 --> 08:21.012
For answers, here's an exclusive
sneak peek behind the scenes.

08:21.014 --> 08:23.614
Eric Haven, say hello
to the "MythBusters" audience.

08:23.616 --> 08:24.749
Hello.

08:24.751 --> 08:26.651
Now, we used to do the drawings for this.

08:28.654 --> 08:30.788
How did you end up doing
all the blueprint drawings?

08:30.790 --> 08:32.356
Well, the executive producer knew

08:32.357 --> 08:33.857
that I was a comic book artist,

08:33.860 --> 08:35.693
so he thought that I should take a crack

08:35.695 --> 08:37.061
at these blueprint drawings.

08:37.063 --> 08:38.796
And the first one turned out pretty swell,

08:38.798 --> 08:40.298
so I've been doing them ever since.

08:41.601 --> 08:42.732
How many do you think you've done?

08:44.670 --> 08:46.938
Probably close to 500.

08:46.940 --> 08:49.006
What are some of the favorite
drawings you've done for the show?

08:49.008 --> 08:52.376
Well, I liked
the "flying guillotine" drawing.

08:52.378 --> 08:55.046
And the "battle of the sexes"
was fun, too.

08:55.048 --> 08:57.515
Both of them featured decapitated Torys.

08:57.517 --> 08:59.884
How does it feel to be
on this side of the camera?

08:59.886 --> 09:01.919
It feels very strange and unnatural.

09:03.723 --> 09:05.122
Well, why don't you sign that?

09:07.494 --> 09:09.794
Okay. My turn.

09:09.796 --> 09:11.963
"You get some great
high-speeds on the show."

09:11.965 --> 09:13.097
"What's your favorite,"

09:13.099 --> 09:14.899
"and have you ever missed the shot?"

09:14.901 --> 09:17.101
Uh, yeah. Does anybody remember
the cement truck?

09:18.670 --> 09:19.904
Hey, hey!

09:19.906 --> 09:21.939
All right! Whoo!

09:21.941 --> 09:24.642
<i>The</i> most famous explosion
in "MythBusters" history,

09:24.644 --> 09:26.811
and we don't have a high-speed shot of it

09:26.813 --> 09:28.079
from a technical glitch.

09:28.081 --> 09:29.380
Fire in the hole.

09:29.382 --> 09:32.617
Yeah, we had to slow down
the real-time footage.

09:35.854 --> 09:37.688
When you're shooting these events,

09:37.690 --> 09:39.891
they happen so quickly
that they're very unpredictable,

09:39.893 --> 09:41.025
and it's hard to catch them.

09:41.027 --> 09:42.260
Yeah, but what's your favorite?

09:42.262 --> 09:43.794
Oh, mine's definitely "car skip."

09:47.933 --> 09:50.034
I mean, seeing that yellow sports car

09:50.036 --> 09:53.271
flip end over end on the water,
it's like automotive ballet.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.908
Mine is similar to ballet.

09:56.910 --> 09:58.509
It's when Adam was on the treadmill...

09:58.511 --> 10:00.344
Ugh!

10:00.346 --> 10:01.746
and he landed on his face.

10:03.382 --> 10:05.783
Okay! I'm totally cool!

10:05.785 --> 10:07.785
I never get tired of watching that.

10:07.787 --> 10:12.423
Or what about
when Adam was fire walking?

10:12.425 --> 10:14.592
Aah!

10:14.594 --> 10:16.761
Or what about when he was
swinging the bat?

10:16.763 --> 10:17.862
Ah!

10:17.864 --> 10:20.231
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

10:20.233 --> 10:23.434
Yeah, but no one can forget
when Adam got slapped by Jamie.

10:26.806 --> 10:28.706
Oh, my God!

10:28.708 --> 10:30.374
It's like
your whole head is rubber.

10:30.376 --> 10:32.343
So, basically
any time Adam gets hurt.

10:32.345 --> 10:34.178
Shots of Adam being abused...

10:34.180 --> 10:35.246
- and misused...
- Ohh!

10:35.248 --> 10:37.248
- are the most memorable.
- Aah!

10:37.250 --> 10:38.649
Can we move on
to something else now?

10:38.651 --> 10:41.152
Here we go. Cut.

10:41.154 --> 10:43.521
But the state-of-the-art
camera technology

10:43.523 --> 10:47.058
is used to capture
an array of incredible images.

10:47.060 --> 10:50.261
And aside from
the occasional missed moment,

10:50.263 --> 10:51.429
the team behind the camera

10:51.431 --> 10:54.799
always artfully catches
the split-second action

10:54.801 --> 10:56.801
for your viewing pleasure.

10:56.803 --> 10:59.036
That might be one of my favorite
high-speed shots we've ever gotten.

10:59.038 --> 11:00.304
That's gorgeous.

11:00.306 --> 11:03.207
Coming up on the mailbag special...

11:03.209 --> 11:04.809
Ooh, this could be a show in itself.

11:04.811 --> 11:06.811
a flash in the van.

11:06.813 --> 11:08.879
Is Jamie man or mustache?

11:08.881 --> 11:10.615
And it's tool time.

11:16.022 --> 11:18.089
Do not try what
you're about to see at home.

11:18.091 --> 11:19.557
We're what you call experts.

11:19.559 --> 11:20.725
Ow!

11:27.133 --> 11:28.366
♪ Come on

11:28.368 --> 11:29.734
Kari, Grant and Tory

11:29.736 --> 11:31.703
are catching up on correspondence.

11:31.705 --> 11:33.038
Fire!

11:34.340 --> 11:36.374
They're answering
your queries...

11:36.376 --> 11:37.842
Definitely good to start with a bang.

11:37.844 --> 11:39.077
and questions...

11:39.079 --> 11:40.679
So, basically any time Adam gets hurt.

11:40.681 --> 11:43.782
and testing a mailbag of mini myths.

11:44.918 --> 11:46.651
So, what's next?

11:46.653 --> 11:49.387
"In the show, it usually takes
you guys about half an hour"

11:49.389 --> 11:51.256
"to test a myth from start to finish."

11:51.258 --> 11:53.992
"If you bust it early,
you then replicate the results."

11:53.994 --> 11:56.428
"But when you confirm a myth,
the story ends."

11:58.331 --> 12:00.065
Wow!

12:00.067 --> 12:01.333
Totally confirmed.

12:01.335 --> 12:03.735
"My question is, have you ever
confirmed a myth so early"

12:03.737 --> 12:06.571
"that you didn't have enough time
to tell the story?"

12:06.573 --> 12:08.406
Yeah, there have been some times
where this has happened.

12:08.408 --> 12:11.476
But then there was one story
that worked so well

12:11.478 --> 12:13.244
that we had to throw the whole thing out,

12:13.246 --> 12:15.680
which is a shame because it was
a pretty awesome explosion.

12:15.682 --> 12:17.349
So, why don't we show it now?

12:17.351 --> 12:20.085
The myth of the "vanishing van"

12:20.087 --> 12:23.955
was a classic case
of premature confirmation.

12:23.957 --> 12:27.058
The story lasted
for just one brief explosion

12:27.060 --> 12:29.928
that, until now,
has been sitting on the shelf.

12:29.930 --> 12:31.663
Grant, take it away.

12:32.933 --> 12:35.867
So, this guy was working in
a Russian chemical factory,

12:35.869 --> 12:38.003
and he left his van over the weekend.

12:38.005 --> 12:39.571
There was a chemical leak.

12:39.573 --> 12:42.040
The van became filled with
a mystery concoction

12:42.042 --> 12:43.274
of different gases...

12:43.276 --> 12:46.211
oxygen, hydrogen, propane,
methane, who knows.

12:46.213 --> 12:48.179
So, he comes out after the weekend

12:48.181 --> 12:50.348
to unlock his van with his key remote.

12:50.350 --> 12:52.083
Boop-boop! Bang!

12:52.085 --> 12:54.352
The van explodes.

12:54.354 --> 12:55.954
Now, we set up the test full scale,

12:55.956 --> 12:57.555
assuming that it wasn't gonna work.

12:57.557 --> 12:59.858
Which is exactly what
all the scientists we talked to

12:59.860 --> 13:01.960
said was gonna happen or...
not happen.

13:01.962 --> 13:03.828
Then...

13:03.830 --> 13:05.597
it worked perfectly the first time,

13:05.599 --> 13:06.798
so we didn't have any story to tell.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.033
So, the question

13:08.035 --> 13:09.868
the team was attempting to answer was,

13:09.870 --> 13:12.404
could a remote control ignite a van

13:12.406 --> 13:15.373
that had filled with flammable gas?

13:15.375 --> 13:17.575
Our research team said, "no way!"

13:17.577 --> 13:21.713
And so, step one was
to go for it in full scale.

13:21.715 --> 13:25.216
And now we seal it. No leaks.

13:25.218 --> 13:26.618
Expecting that to fail,

13:26.620 --> 13:29.721
the team would then get into
the science of stoichiometry

13:29.723 --> 13:33.024
and replicate the results
any way they could.

13:33.026 --> 13:36.261
Aw, yeah. We got some '70s van going now.

13:36.263 --> 13:37.862
At least, that was the plan.

13:37.864 --> 13:39.230
All right. To the bat cave.

13:39.232 --> 13:40.465
But with the van rigged

13:40.467 --> 13:43.501
and ready to fill with
a mystery gas cocktail,

13:43.503 --> 13:47.072
that plan went up in smoke... literally.

13:47.074 --> 13:49.374
All right.
You guys ready to start filling?

13:49.376 --> 13:50.442
I'm ready.

13:50.444 --> 13:52.677
3...2...1.

13:52.679 --> 13:53.878
Commence filling.

13:53.880 --> 13:56.047
All right. Time to start it.

13:56.049 --> 13:58.216
The chemical van begins to fill,

13:58.218 --> 14:00.552
but no one is expecting a big boom.

14:00.554 --> 14:02.687
So, the only tension is from bad acting.

14:02.689 --> 14:04.122
It's quiet out there.

14:04.124 --> 14:05.990
Almost <i>too</i> quiet.

14:05.992 --> 14:07.425
And as soon as the van is full

14:07.427 --> 14:10.495
with a weekend's worth of a slow gas leak,

14:10.497 --> 14:13.431
Grant, from a safe distance,
is ready to simulate

14:13.433 --> 14:16.167
the electronic signal of the key remote.

14:16.169 --> 14:19.270
But the team is not expecting
a detonation.

14:19.272 --> 14:21.739
3...2...1...

14:22.775 --> 14:25.076
- Aah!
- Aah! Aah!

14:25.078 --> 14:27.045
Oh, man!

14:27.047 --> 14:28.713
Stuff's still dropping!

14:28.715 --> 14:29.848
Oh, my gosh!

14:29.850 --> 14:33.952
That ladder went over 200 feet in the air!

14:33.954 --> 14:35.920
I think this is freaking confirmed!

14:35.922 --> 14:37.188
Let's go look at the carnage.

14:37.190 --> 14:38.690
- I want to check this out.
- Oh, my God!

14:38.692 --> 14:39.891
That's a lot of power.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.561
In 1/1000 of a second,

14:43.563 --> 14:46.498
the unexpected explosion
blew the roof off the van

14:46.500 --> 14:48.833
and sent debris far and wide,

14:48.835 --> 14:50.869
leaving the team
with an early confirmation

14:50.871 --> 14:54.272
and the smoldering wreckage of a story.

14:54.274 --> 14:56.241
We hit the ignition system,

14:56.243 --> 15:00.078
and then instantly there was
this huge, orange fire ball

15:00.080 --> 15:02.180
and the van was disintegrated.

15:02.182 --> 15:03.882
I mean, can you imagine coming out,

15:03.884 --> 15:05.550
hitting the remote key on your car,

15:05.552 --> 15:07.218
and it blowing up in front of you?

15:07.220 --> 15:10.388
We just saw that firsthand.
This one's confirmed.

15:10.390 --> 15:13.057
Yep. Confirmed.

15:13.059 --> 15:16.528
But one quick flash in the van
wasn't enough for a whole story.

15:16.530 --> 15:19.063
However, it did answer your question.

15:19.065 --> 15:20.498
So, what's next?

15:20.500 --> 15:23.535
"It seems that Jamie is
the ultimate straight man."

15:23.537 --> 15:24.903
Happy.

15:24.905 --> 15:26.171
"Is that an act,"

15:26.173 --> 15:28.006
"or does he really show
very little emotion?"

15:28.008 --> 15:29.841
Sad.

15:29.843 --> 15:31.876
I've known him for quite a long time,

15:31.878 --> 15:34.412
and I've never seen him get
too emotional about too much.

15:34.414 --> 15:36.281
I kind of like it in here. It's private.

15:36.283 --> 15:38.583
But he <i>does</i> get excited about things.

15:38.585 --> 15:40.351
Bye-bye!

15:40.353 --> 15:42.687
When in doubt, C-4.

15:43.823 --> 15:45.423
Like when they were working
on the jet pack,

15:45.425 --> 15:47.192
the first time they fired it up.

15:47.194 --> 15:48.593
When the mustache waves up,

15:48.595 --> 15:51.663
you can actually see kind of
a smile happening under there.

15:51.665 --> 15:54.065
So, it does happen occasionally.

15:54.067 --> 15:56.434
I've never seen Jamie so happy in my life.

15:56.436 --> 15:59.270
So, not giggling like a school
girl or anything like that.

15:59.272 --> 16:00.872
Jamie wants big boom.

16:00.874 --> 16:02.106
No, not usually.

16:02.108 --> 16:03.942
Like a big, buff, bald school girl

16:03.944 --> 16:05.710
with a beret and a mustache?

16:05.712 --> 16:07.745
- Okay, now I'm disturbed.
- Me too.

16:07.747 --> 16:09.314
I feel kind of sexy.

16:09.316 --> 16:10.782
With Jamie, what you see is what you get...

16:10.784 --> 16:14.586
part walrus, part robot, mostly mustache.

16:14.588 --> 16:17.121
He's just a regular, beret-wearing genius,

16:17.123 --> 16:19.891
who, while keeping
his emotions under control,

16:19.893 --> 16:21.893
likes to wear high heels.

16:21.895 --> 16:23.995
It's just another day on the job.

16:23.997 --> 16:25.330
So, this fan writes in...

16:25.332 --> 16:27.298
ooh, this could be a show in itself.

16:27.300 --> 16:30.902
"What is your favorite tool
in the shop and why?"

16:30.904 --> 16:32.604
Well, why don't we split up
and do a little show-and-tell?

16:35.040 --> 16:38.243
Building, rigging, replicating,

16:38.245 --> 16:40.745
modeling, construction, and deconstruction

16:40.747 --> 16:44.182
are in some way part
of every "MythBusters" story.

16:44.184 --> 16:48.253
And to do it, the team uses
a whole heap of cool tools.

16:51.725 --> 16:53.258
Aw.

16:53.260 --> 16:55.460
My favorite tool in the shop...
besides Tory...

16:55.462 --> 16:57.595
Ohh!

16:57.597 --> 16:59.330
is the plasma cutter.

16:59.332 --> 17:02.200
It instantly liquifies metal.

17:02.202 --> 17:05.670
It basically uses compressed air
and an electric arc

17:05.672 --> 17:08.071
to cut out any shape you need.

17:09.974 --> 17:12.010
So, what's <i>my</i> favorite tool in our shop?

17:12.012 --> 17:13.211
Well, it's our forklift.

17:14.880 --> 17:17.548
Our forklift is a little bit different.

17:17.550 --> 17:19.617
See, it's got these four omni wheels

17:19.618 --> 17:21.919
that let it do all kinds of crazy moves,

17:21.921 --> 17:24.088
like spin in a circle...

17:24.089 --> 17:25.857
or track side-to-side.

17:25.858 --> 17:28.893
In fact, it can do
all these moves at once,

17:28.895 --> 17:31.162
simultaneously.

17:35.035 --> 17:38.536
What I have here is
a 14-inch, 5-horsepower,

17:38.538 --> 17:41.372
gasoline-powered cut-off saw.

17:43.810 --> 17:46.044
This thing's capable
of cutting through concrete,

17:46.046 --> 17:48.112
rock, even steel!

17:51.083 --> 17:54.118
In fact, my favorite time
I used this on the show was

17:54.120 --> 17:55.620
when we cut a car in half!

17:56.889 --> 17:59.157
This tool gets the job done!

18:01.093 --> 18:03.127
And that sums up
the team's tool preferences...

18:03.129 --> 18:05.863
cool, hot cutting...

18:05.865 --> 18:07.098
wheely versatility...

18:07.100 --> 18:09.967
and testosterone-fueled demolition.

18:09.969 --> 18:12.670
Next up, we're gonna blow up
this washing machine with C-4.

18:12.672 --> 18:15.273
We're gonna take this one to the cleaners.

18:17.000 --> 18:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:24.737 --> 18:26.738
It's the Mailbag Special.

18:26.740 --> 18:28.807
And with the letters piling up,

18:28.809 --> 18:30.108
Kari, Grant, and Tory

18:30.110 --> 18:32.310
are randomly selecting and then answering

18:32.312 --> 18:35.447
your questions, queries, and concerns.

18:35.449 --> 18:37.148
So, what's next?

18:37.150 --> 18:38.984
All right, so, this letter
comes from a fan

18:38.986 --> 18:40.218
who wants to know,

18:40.220 --> 18:42.954
"what was your favorite
'MythBusters' moment?"

18:45.158 --> 18:46.992
We made it!

18:46.994 --> 18:48.360
Oh, there's been so many!

18:48.362 --> 18:49.628
- Say "hoax."
- Hoax!

18:49.630 --> 18:50.729
Here comes chaos.

18:50.731 --> 18:52.397
That is messed up!

18:52.399 --> 18:54.532
Yep, with over 700 myths,

18:54.534 --> 18:56.768
finding a favorite moment is no easy task.

18:56.770 --> 19:00.038
But Grant thinks he's got his figured out.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.806
It has to be the luxury car drop myth.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.042
A classic tall tale testing a commercial

19:04.044 --> 19:08.380
that compares a car's top speed
and its terminal velocity.

19:08.382 --> 19:11.716
We drop a car from a helicopter
in the desert,

19:11.718 --> 19:14.653
then we go racing after it
with a radio-controlled car.

19:14.655 --> 19:17.255
Dropping in 3...2...1.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.858
Release the car!

19:19.860 --> 19:21.826
Holding 105.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.229
Here comes the car! Holding 105!

19:24.231 --> 19:26.364
Whoo!

19:26.366 --> 19:28.033
Just hit the desert!

19:28.035 --> 19:29.467
Target's coming up.

19:29.469 --> 19:32.037
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

19:32.039 --> 19:34.172
It was like Luke
down the death star trench

19:34.174 --> 19:35.674
when the "X" comes up. Yeah!

19:37.144 --> 19:39.144
But that's a myth.

19:39.146 --> 19:41.446
They are talking about
one moment from "MythBusters"

19:41.448 --> 19:42.747
- that was your favorite.
- True.

19:42.749 --> 19:45.317
I reject your reality
and substitute my own.

19:45.319 --> 19:46.451
Well, then it has to be

19:46.453 --> 19:48.620
from the most recent
Hollywood fender bender,

19:48.622 --> 19:53.091
where we rear-ended a car
with a truck on a rocket sled.

19:57.965 --> 19:59.631
Oh, my God, what just happened?

19:59.633 --> 20:01.366
- I don't know.
- I don't know!

20:05.137 --> 20:07.772
You know what I liked,
was from supersized special

20:07.774 --> 20:10.675
where you were wake-boarding
behind that cruise ship.

20:10.677 --> 20:13.044
I can't believe I'm gonna do this!

20:13.046 --> 20:14.479
I mean, the cruise ship was huge,

20:14.481 --> 20:16.982
and that wake behind it was just insane.

20:16.984 --> 20:18.083
And every time you fell down,

20:18.085 --> 20:19.617
we'd have to get you in the catch boat,

20:19.619 --> 20:22.721
catch up to the cruise ship,
get you back on the wake,

20:22.723 --> 20:24.189
and we were going further
and further out to sea.

20:24.191 --> 20:27.826
And then finally you did it.
It was so exciting.

20:27.828 --> 20:29.027
Whoo!

20:29.029 --> 20:30.528
You're the man!

20:30.530 --> 20:33.131
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

20:33.133 --> 20:34.099
Yeah!

20:34.101 --> 20:36.634
Whoo!

20:36.636 --> 20:38.003
All right. My turn.

20:38.005 --> 20:39.404
Oh, I think it's my turn.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.473
Okay. Let's both pick
and see which one's the best.

20:41.475 --> 20:42.574
All right.

20:42.576 --> 20:44.309
"Dear MythBusters,"

20:44.311 --> 20:47.412
"you have a lot of explosions on the show."

20:47.414 --> 20:50.148
"How do you guys film them?"

20:54.420 --> 20:56.354
- Oh, yeah.
- Wow.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.189
This one says, "dear MythBusters,"

20:58.191 --> 21:00.925
"if you put a pound of C-4
in a washing machine"

21:00.927 --> 21:02.861
"and a pound of C-4 in a dryer,"

21:02.863 --> 21:04.829
"which one will blow up better?"

21:04.831 --> 21:06.664
Well, why don't we kill
two birds with one stone?

21:08.168 --> 21:09.334
Now, that's a myth.

21:09.336 --> 21:10.869
We can blow up a dryer and a washer

21:10.871 --> 21:11.870
and show how we film it.

21:11.872 --> 21:13.071
Sounds good to me.

21:13.073 --> 21:14.773
I'd help you, but I'm not sure what to do.

21:17.376 --> 21:20.879
Okay. My dress shirts go on delicate.

21:20.881 --> 21:24.015
So, we've come to the
Yolo County sheriff's bomb range

21:24.017 --> 21:25.216
for two reasons.

21:25.218 --> 21:27.886
The first is to blow up
a washer and a dryer

21:27.888 --> 21:30.221
and compare how they explode.

21:30.223 --> 21:34.092
Second is to show you
exactly how we film that.

21:36.228 --> 21:39.497
Now, the first step
in filming an explosion is

21:39.499 --> 21:42.100
picking the spot where
you're gonna blow up the item.

21:42.102 --> 21:43.835
That spot is gonna be right here.

21:43.837 --> 21:46.471
Then the next job is
setting up the cameras

21:46.473 --> 21:49.240
to find the right angles
to capture the explosion.

21:49.242 --> 21:51.643
Now, that job is done by none other

21:51.645 --> 21:54.479
than this Australian cameraman Ben Hanson.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.414
Hello. Make sure you frame me well.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.850
Next to him is Al.
She's recording the sound.

21:58.852 --> 21:59.851
And this is Duncan.

21:59.853 --> 22:01.119
That's a high-speed camera

22:01.121 --> 22:03.088
that he's gonna capture the explosion.

22:03.090 --> 22:06.291
And while explosives
expert Frank Doyle

22:06.293 --> 22:09.427
rigs the C-4 and det cord,

22:09.429 --> 22:12.063
the camera team scouts the area

22:12.065 --> 22:14.065
and then prepares to capture the action

22:14.067 --> 22:15.300
by placing the cameras...

22:15.302 --> 22:17.569
Just a little plex to protect the lens.

22:17.571 --> 22:19.637
and protecting their equipment.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.973
They don't like it
when we blow up cameras.

22:21.975 --> 22:23.908
And we've blown up a lot.

22:25.377 --> 22:26.778
Okay, Ben and Duncan.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.514
What camera angles
have you set up for this?

22:29.516 --> 22:32.283
We have seven cameras total.

22:32.285 --> 22:34.419
Some of them are up close
in the danger zone,

22:34.421 --> 22:36.221
and they're protected by steel boxes

22:36.223 --> 22:37.689
with plex over the lenses.

22:37.691 --> 22:40.625
And we also have our high-speed
camera set up out that way,

22:40.627 --> 22:41.826
sort of where the hosts are gonna be.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.229
With the plan in place,

22:44.231 --> 22:45.797
it's time to wrangle the hosts...

22:45.799 --> 22:48.533
Can the hosts take
their positions, please?

22:48.535 --> 22:51.136
and run around rolling the cameras.

22:51.138 --> 22:53.938
With all seven remote cameras
ready to capture the action

22:53.940 --> 22:56.908
from every conceivable angle...

22:56.910 --> 22:58.109
Rolling cameras.

22:58.111 --> 22:59.611
Kari, Grant, and Tory

22:59.613 --> 23:02.514
call the countdown
on this explosive comparison.

23:02.516 --> 23:05.383
All right. Time to take
this machine to the cleaners.

23:05.385 --> 23:08.119
First up for destruction
is the washing machine.

23:08.121 --> 23:11.589
All right, this is blowing up
the washing machine with C-4.

23:11.591 --> 23:15.727
Here we go in 3...2...1... firing.

23:15.729 --> 23:17.295
Ooh!

23:17.297 --> 23:18.796
Aah ha ha!

23:20.133 --> 23:22.100
It was gone in a blink of an eye,

23:22.102 --> 23:24.469
but each of the carefully placed
cameras caught the moment,

23:24.471 --> 23:28.506
and each angle added
a different perspective.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.508
Still alive. Got the shot.

23:30.510 --> 23:33.511
Of course, the key
shot for the crucial comparison

23:33.513 --> 23:34.712
is from the high-speed,

23:34.714 --> 23:37.148
recorded at 1,000 frames per second,

23:37.150 --> 23:39.551
it illustrates and illuminates events

23:39.553 --> 23:42.086
the human eye can't register.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.255
And while we've been taking in
the footage,

23:44.257 --> 23:46.558
the team has been resetting the cameras

23:46.560 --> 23:49.194
and explosives for the dryer detonation.

23:49.196 --> 23:51.763
This is washer versus dryer explosion,

23:51.765 --> 23:55.200
dryer, in 3...2...1...

23:58.205 --> 23:59.771
- That was huge!
- It's gone!

23:59.773 --> 24:01.973
Pretty much disintegrated.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.842
Nothing left.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.844
The C-4 made short work of the dryer,

24:06.846 --> 24:09.080
much like it did with the washer.

24:09.082 --> 24:12.450
In terms of a comparison,
there's not much in it.

24:12.452 --> 24:14.886
All right. So, I guess
if you had to pick a winner,

24:14.888 --> 24:17.088
I guess the drier did blow up better

24:17.090 --> 24:18.723
than the washing machine.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.325
But you know what? It's not by much.

24:20.327 --> 24:21.659
Regardless, both awesome,

24:21.661 --> 24:24.195
and a perfect way to show
how our cameras work.

24:24.197 --> 24:26.731
Or <i>used</i> to work.

24:26.733 --> 24:30.068
We broke another one.

24:30.070 --> 24:33.905
That's number seven.

24:33.907 --> 24:36.074
Up next...

24:36.076 --> 24:38.109
Welcome to the "MythBusters" trivia quiz.

24:38.111 --> 24:39.877
tension, trivia...

24:39.879 --> 24:40.945
Almost had it!

24:40.947 --> 24:42.747
and ultimately just one winner.

24:42.749 --> 24:43.881
The winner is...

24:46.850 --> 24:48.951
Please, don't try what
you're about to see at home.

24:48.953 --> 24:50.719
We're what you call experts!

24:50.721 --> 24:52.955
Yeah!

24:59.696 --> 25:02.631
Mad, bad...

25:02.633 --> 25:04.500
Yeah!

25:04.502 --> 25:06.602
big rigs, mean machines...

25:06.604 --> 25:08.437
Watch out!

25:08.439 --> 25:10.873
and crazy builds...

25:10.875 --> 25:11.907
Yee-haw!

25:11.909 --> 25:13.942
This is actually working.

25:13.944 --> 25:16.245
are essential cogs in most myths.

25:16.247 --> 25:17.513
Ohh! Whoa!

25:17.515 --> 25:20.315
Working on these machines
is great for my skin!

25:20.317 --> 25:23.519
So, the next mailbag inquiry
is a tough one

25:23.521 --> 25:26.421
because there are literally
hundreds to choose from.

25:26.423 --> 25:28.357
He's alive! Alive!

25:30.060 --> 25:33.629
"What is your favorite thing
you've ever built for the show?"

25:33.631 --> 25:35.864
Mine has definitely got to be
the sword-swinging robot.

25:35.866 --> 25:36.999
I love that one!

25:37.001 --> 25:40.302
Yeah, I mean, it is simple yet effective

25:40.304 --> 25:42.104
and very, very deadly.

25:42.106 --> 25:44.306
Decapitation hazard, everybody.

25:45.476 --> 25:46.742
Ohh!

25:48.445 --> 25:50.646
I really liked the giant hamster ball

25:50.648 --> 25:52.147
from "beat the guard dog,"

25:52.149 --> 25:54.583
mostly because it's just
so classic "MythBusters."

25:54.585 --> 25:56.151
He doesn't even see her.

25:56.153 --> 25:57.386
You are invisible.

25:57.388 --> 25:59.054
Is that the ball of invisibility?

25:59.056 --> 26:01.590
It's not even outside the box.
There <i>is</i> no box.

26:01.592 --> 26:03.191
It's like, "you want to beat
the guard dog?"

26:03.193 --> 26:04.426
"How about a giant hamster ball?"

26:04.428 --> 26:06.295
And everybody goes, "yeah! Exactly!"

26:06.297 --> 26:07.796
Got the necklace!

26:09.999 --> 26:12.868
Way back when,
Adam and Jamie pitted their wits

26:12.870 --> 26:16.305
in the hour-long special
"The Ultimate MythBuster,"

26:16.307 --> 26:19.408
including a quiz on episodes past.

26:19.410 --> 26:21.777
Damn, that's correct again.

26:21.779 --> 26:23.312
But this viewer

26:23.314 --> 26:25.314
has our intrepid trio
in their trivia sights.

26:25.316 --> 26:27.883
Okay, so, "I've written you a quiz."

26:27.885 --> 26:29.017
No way.

26:29.019 --> 26:30.452
"So, are you ready?"

26:30.454 --> 26:32.821
You want to do this right?
Get a quiz master and stuff?

26:32.823 --> 26:35.057
All right. Cue the game show set.

26:38.095 --> 26:39.294
Hello.

26:39.296 --> 26:41.997
And welcome to
the "MythBusters" trivia quiz.

26:41.999 --> 26:44.066
I'm your quiz master Adam Savage.

26:44.068 --> 26:46.501
And our contestants Tory Belleci,

26:46.503 --> 26:49.671
Grant Imahara, and Kari Byron.

26:49.673 --> 26:51.974
A right answer gets you 10 points.

26:51.976 --> 26:54.276
A wrong answer loses you 5 points.

26:54.278 --> 26:56.144
Whoever has the most points at the end

26:56.146 --> 26:58.080
is crowned the winner and wins nothing.

26:58.082 --> 26:59.314
Are you guys ready?

26:59.316 --> 27:00.449
Excellent.

27:00.451 --> 27:01.583
I've always wanted nothing!

27:01.585 --> 27:03.785
Let's do this! Here we go! First question!

27:03.787 --> 27:07.990
What was the first myth
that used the bunker?

27:09.059 --> 27:11.059
Kari. What is "confederate rocket"?

27:11.061 --> 27:12.327
Fire in the hole!

27:13.897 --> 27:16.264
You don't have to answer
in the form of a question.

27:16.266 --> 27:18.433
- But that is correct!
- Whoo!

27:18.435 --> 27:20.068
Boo-whoo!

27:20.070 --> 27:21.603
Whoo-whoo!

27:21.605 --> 27:23.705
According to the script
in the supersized special,

27:23.707 --> 27:26.074
the reunion of what two pop bands

27:26.076 --> 27:28.310
got Grant particularly excited?

27:28.312 --> 27:29.678
Uh-oh... uhh.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.480
It's 'N Sync and The Backstreet Boys.

27:31.482 --> 27:32.514
Half correct.

27:32.516 --> 27:33.582
You get 5 points for that answer.

27:33.584 --> 27:34.650
The correct answer is

27:34.652 --> 27:37.152
The Spice Girls and The Backstreet Boys.

27:37.154 --> 27:38.887
Yeah!

27:38.889 --> 27:43.425
What method was best at keeping
needles on a Christmas tree?

27:43.427 --> 27:45.394
- Kari.
- Hair spray.

27:45.396 --> 27:46.395
Yes.

27:46.397 --> 27:48.330
Very nice. Very nice.

27:48.332 --> 27:52.634
During what test did I lose an eyebrow?

27:52.636 --> 27:54.102
Kari.

27:54.104 --> 27:55.871
"Exploding gas station"...
"cellphone gas station."

27:55.873 --> 27:56.872
Correct!

27:58.708 --> 28:01.009
Am I missing an eyebrow?

28:01.011 --> 28:02.577
Bonus question...

28:02.579 --> 28:05.447
why was I particularly upset
about losing an eyebrow?

28:05.449 --> 28:07.182
- You were going out on a date.
- Yes!

28:07.184 --> 28:09.317
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

28:09.319 --> 28:10.352
Finally, I'm on the board.

28:10.354 --> 28:12.487
How many challenges out of four

28:12.489 --> 28:14.623
did Jamie and I complete successfully

28:14.625 --> 28:16.358
in the "MacGyver" challenge?

28:16.360 --> 28:17.893
Grant!

28:17.895 --> 28:19.261
- Three.
- Yes!

28:19.263 --> 28:20.529
Yes!

28:20.531 --> 28:22.330
With the tension mounting...

28:22.332 --> 28:24.366
- Blendo.
- Yes.

28:24.368 --> 28:25.634
God, almost had it!

28:25.636 --> 28:27.035
quiz master Adam
picks up the pace.

28:27.037 --> 28:30.138
And trivia queen Kari
nails it down the home stretch.

28:30.140 --> 28:33.709
What happened every time
Kari fired the gun?

28:33.711 --> 28:35.610
- Her baby kicked.
- Yes!

28:37.181 --> 28:38.847
Weird!

28:38.849 --> 28:41.149
Next question. What were
the three materials

28:41.151 --> 28:42.350
used to make rope...

28:42.352 --> 28:43.652
- Toilet paper...
- Yes.

28:43.654 --> 28:45.087
- hair...
- Yes.

28:45.089 --> 28:47.255
- and bed sheets.
- Yes!

28:47.257 --> 28:49.491
What is Jamie's bachelor's degree in?

28:49.493 --> 28:50.826
Russian literature.

28:50.828 --> 28:52.394
- Yes!
- What?!

28:52.396 --> 28:54.463
Kari totally takes it home.

28:54.465 --> 28:56.665
What?!

28:56.667 --> 28:59.167
The winner is Kari Byron!

28:59.169 --> 29:01.703
I've always wanted nothing!

29:01.705 --> 29:05.073
Oh, thank you, mom and dad!

29:05.075 --> 29:08.143
Indeed, Kari goes home with
a big, fat bucket of nothing.

29:08.145 --> 29:10.579
Thanks for playing, contestants.

29:10.581 --> 29:13.415
Thanks, everybody at home.
See you next time!

29:22.864 --> 29:24.164
All right, next letter.

29:24.166 --> 29:26.466
"I heard that a .50-caliber desert eagle,"

29:26.468 --> 29:28.735
"which can pass through an engine block,"

29:28.737 --> 29:32.372
"will not be able to pass through
25 watermelons."

29:32.374 --> 29:33.574
Okay, that's random.

29:33.576 --> 29:34.708
Yeah, totally.

29:34.710 --> 29:37.411
I love a good high-speed of melon carnage.

29:37.413 --> 29:39.913
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!

29:39.915 --> 29:42.015
Remember when we drove
the car through the fruit stand

29:42.017 --> 29:44.051
and all of the just juice
going everywhere?

29:44.053 --> 29:46.019
Yeah. One of the best high-speeds ever.

29:46.021 --> 29:47.588
Let's do it.

29:47.590 --> 29:50.290
A .50-caliber desert eagle pistol

29:50.292 --> 29:53.060
is a steel-piercing piece of weaponry.

29:53.062 --> 29:55.195
Those are some nice melons, Kari.

29:55.197 --> 29:58.165
But is it true that a medley of 25 melons

29:58.167 --> 30:01.368
can really prevent it passing through?

30:01.370 --> 30:03.604
We're firing a .50-caliber round
through these watermelons.

30:03.606 --> 30:05.205
Now, just to put this into perspective,

30:05.207 --> 30:07.908
a .50-caliber round can
shoot through an engine block,

30:07.910 --> 30:10.377
and it can take down an 800-pound boar

30:10.379 --> 30:11.979
charging straight at you.

30:11.981 --> 30:14.014
It's gonna be fun to see what
it does to a couple watermelons.

30:14.016 --> 30:16.216
All right. So, who's gonna take the shot?

30:16.218 --> 30:17.417
Want to roshambo for it?

30:17.419 --> 30:19.419
I thought we were gonna wrestle for it.

30:19.421 --> 30:21.188
All right, fine.

30:21.190 --> 30:23.423
Ro... sham... bo.

30:23.425 --> 30:25.192
Psh! I guess I win.

30:25.194 --> 30:26.827
You're probably gonna want to wear this.

30:26.829 --> 30:27.961
It's gonna get messy.

30:27.963 --> 30:29.096
Sore loser.

30:29.098 --> 30:31.164
With Kari dressed for a mess...

30:31.166 --> 30:33.667
Yep. I make this look good.

30:33.669 --> 30:35.802
Tory has some useful advice.

30:35.804 --> 30:38.972
Just remember... aim for the melons.

30:38.974 --> 30:40.741
Good luck.

30:40.743 --> 30:42.209
How many you think it's gonna get through?

30:42.211 --> 30:43.744
I don't know. Maybe about 10.

30:43.746 --> 30:45.479
- 10? That's my guess, too.
- Yeah.

30:45.481 --> 30:46.780
All right, this is

30:46.782 --> 30:50.050
"can you fire a .50-caliber
round through 25 watermelons?"

30:50.052 --> 30:51.151
Take it away, Kari.

30:51.153 --> 30:52.786
Here we go.

30:54.355 --> 30:56.523
What?! That's it?

30:57.893 --> 31:00.927
It turns out 10, never mind 25,

31:00.929 --> 31:02.362
was a gross overestimate.

31:02.364 --> 31:05.332
And by the time the guys
throw some science at it,

31:05.334 --> 31:06.700
they work out the "why?"

31:06.702 --> 31:09.302
We went through three watermelons.
That's incredible.

31:09.304 --> 31:11.338
Well, you know, it really does make sense.

31:11.340 --> 31:14.074
When Jamie and Adam were firing
the .50-caliber sniper rifle

31:14.076 --> 31:15.342
into the swimming pool...

31:15.344 --> 31:17.411
1.

31:17.413 --> 31:20.580
it got like a couple feet at most.

31:20.582 --> 31:22.549
So, watermelons, full of water.

31:22.551 --> 31:24.584
Yeah. Water's not compressible.

31:24.586 --> 31:26.420
I mean, it does make sense,

31:26.422 --> 31:28.422
but, man, I thought it was
gonna go further than that.

31:29.824 --> 31:32.459
This myth is totally confirmed.

31:32.461 --> 31:35.328
A .50-caliber round cannot
go through 25 watermelons.

31:35.330 --> 31:38.098
In fact, we only got it
to go through three.

31:38.100 --> 31:40.801
It's a beautiful illustration
of the expenditure of energy.

31:40.803 --> 31:44.037
The bullet enters
the first watermelon... boof!

31:44.039 --> 31:45.939
And all of the energy is just absorbed

31:45.941 --> 31:48.308
and smashes the watermelon
into a million pieces.

31:48.310 --> 31:49.943
Then we go into the second watermelon,

31:49.945 --> 31:52.412
and it just kind of breaks
into two distinct parts.

31:52.414 --> 31:53.980
Then we go into the third watermelon.

31:53.982 --> 31:56.516
We have a beautiful entrance
and exit wound, but that's it.

31:56.518 --> 31:58.752
And then we don't make it
to the fourth watermelon.

31:58.754 --> 32:02.756
So, this is not only confirmed,
but an amazing high-speed.

32:09.330 --> 32:11.665
"Dear MythBusters,"

32:11.667 --> 32:14.668
"what was the most surprising
moment for you on the show?"

32:15.169 --> 32:16.703
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

32:16.705 --> 32:19.673
- It's spinning!
- It's spinning!

32:19.675 --> 32:20.674
That was perfect!

32:20.676 --> 32:21.675
You know what?

32:21.677 --> 32:22.976
I love those moments on "MythBusters"

32:22.978 --> 32:24.644
when you think one thing is gonna happen

32:24.646 --> 32:26.413
and then the exact opposite happens.

32:26.415 --> 32:28.381
They just don't want
to break the china.

32:28.383 --> 32:30.450
- Wow.
- This is ridiculous.

32:30.452 --> 32:33.019
For me it was "Chinese invasion alarm."

32:33.021 --> 32:34.254
1, 2, 3.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.856
That was the story

32:35.858 --> 32:38.358
that the Chinese had an
early-warning detection system

32:38.360 --> 32:39.726
for tunneling armies.

32:39.728 --> 32:42.295
They would sink these goat-skin
drums into the earth,

32:42.297 --> 32:44.197
and they would set people
at the top to listen

32:44.199 --> 32:46.700
to see if they could actually
hear the tunneling army.

32:46.702 --> 32:48.635
So, uh, Jamie, if we find gold,

32:48.637 --> 32:49.903
are you gonna share it with me?

32:49.905 --> 32:52.739
And one.

32:52.741 --> 32:54.908
So, we replicated the circumstances,

32:54.910 --> 32:56.943
and Adam and I were at the top
of a hole listening

32:56.945 --> 32:58.945
to see if we could hear Jamie and Tory

32:58.947 --> 33:00.614
with pickaxes down in a gold mine below.

33:00.616 --> 33:01.815
18...

33:01.817 --> 33:03.150
And all of a sudden...

33:03.152 --> 33:04.384
Tick-tick-tick.

33:04.386 --> 33:06.753
I could totally hear you guys

33:06.755 --> 33:08.588
pickaxing down in the hole.

33:08.590 --> 33:10.690
I just... I was unbelievably surprised.

33:10.692 --> 33:13.126
I can't believe that it worked.

33:13.128 --> 33:14.528
That's incredible.

33:14.530 --> 33:16.463
Yep, over the years,

33:16.465 --> 33:19.332
the team has had a number
of jaw-dropping results...

33:19.334 --> 33:20.500
No way!

33:20.502 --> 33:22.302
results that have defied expectation...

33:22.304 --> 33:23.770
I'm hit!

33:23.772 --> 33:25.438
and provided brilliant examples

33:25.440 --> 33:28.508
that in science
you have to keep an open mind

33:28.510 --> 33:30.577
and test everything.

33:30.579 --> 33:31.912
Let's hope we keep getting surprised,

33:31.914 --> 33:32.946
'cause that is so much fun.

33:32.948 --> 33:35.282
That's the coolest thing ever.

33:35.284 --> 33:36.983
All right.

33:36.985 --> 33:39.019
So, this letter comes from
a fan that writes,

33:39.021 --> 33:42.489
"you should never work
with animals in TV or movies."

33:42.491 --> 33:43.957
Ohh!

33:43.959 --> 33:46.092
"Apparently, you bust
that myth on your show"

33:46.094 --> 33:47.894
"because every time
you guys use an animal,"

33:47.896 --> 33:49.663
"it tends to cooperate."

33:51.333 --> 33:53.233
Well, I mean, I guess we did get lucky

33:53.235 --> 33:54.868
with the bull in the china shop.

33:54.870 --> 33:56.503
He's actually doing a lot
better than I thought he would.

33:56.505 --> 33:57.637
Absolutely.

33:57.639 --> 33:59.372
And fainting goats worked out.

34:01.610 --> 34:04.277
And sharks pretty much do
what we want them to do

34:04.279 --> 34:05.478
when we want them to do it.

34:05.480 --> 34:08.982
Aah!
Something just touched me!

34:08.984 --> 34:11.117
Yeah, like that time
that great white shark

34:11.119 --> 34:12.752
tried to jump into the cage with Jamie.

34:12.754 --> 34:14.254
I mean, that was pretty spectacular.

34:14.255 --> 34:16.523
Aah!

34:16.525 --> 34:18.491
You know, it's not always like that.

34:18.493 --> 34:20.827
Crocodiles who don't zigzag.

34:20.829 --> 34:22.094
Skunks who don't spray.

34:22.097 --> 34:23.496
Do we have another skunk?

34:23.498 --> 34:25.232
Yeah, it's usually through
the magic of editing

34:25.234 --> 34:26.399
that makes it look easy.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.634
Up next...

34:27.636 --> 34:30.203
the Mailbag Special reaches a crescendo

34:30.205 --> 34:33.106
with graceful high-speeds
of falling beer...

34:34.476 --> 34:37.577
and a not-so-graceful flatus fanfare.

34:40.282 --> 34:41.547
There you go.

34:49.553 --> 34:51.120
I'd help you, but I'm not sure what to do.

34:51.121 --> 34:53.956
Kari, Grant, and Tory
have been tackling

34:53.958 --> 34:57.126
your weird and wild suggestions
and questions.

34:58.563 --> 35:00.062
So, it turns out this myth is busted.

35:00.064 --> 35:03.132
The team is committed
to answering whatever you ask,

35:03.134 --> 35:06.035
but next up is surely
the most random of them all.

35:06.037 --> 35:08.804
"Dear MythBusters, what falls faster,"

35:08.806 --> 35:11.574
"a six-pack of light beer
or a six-pack of regular beer?"

35:11.576 --> 35:12.708
Let me see that.

35:12.710 --> 35:14.276
That's what it actually says.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.145
What is this, a David Letterman stunt?

35:16.147 --> 35:17.480
I think we should do it.

35:17.482 --> 35:19.582
But if we're actually gonna set up a crane

35:19.584 --> 35:21.650
and do the whole experiment,
why stop at beer?

35:21.652 --> 35:23.719
Yeah! Let's drop other things
from the crane.

35:23.721 --> 35:25.421
Uh-oh.

35:26.623 --> 35:28.157
The team has a history

35:28.159 --> 35:29.692
of dropping things from a great height.

35:29.694 --> 35:32.661
And logistics-wise, it can get tricky.

35:32.663 --> 35:35.331
But not today.

35:35.333 --> 35:36.665
Okay, as per our viewer request,

35:36.667 --> 35:38.501
we have a six-pack of regular beer

35:38.503 --> 35:40.002
and a six-pack of light beer.

35:40.004 --> 35:41.604
We're going to lift them with a crane,

35:41.606 --> 35:43.105
drop them with a quick release,

35:43.107 --> 35:45.040
and film the entire thing on high-speed

35:45.042 --> 35:47.309
so we can analyze which falls faster,

35:47.311 --> 35:48.644
regular or light beer.

35:48.646 --> 35:50.913
Kind of a shame
to be wasting all this beer.

35:50.915 --> 35:52.181
But who knows?

35:52.183 --> 35:54.383
Maybe we're wrong.
Maybe he's got something here.

35:54.385 --> 35:56.485
Or maybe he's just been
drinking too much beer.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.320
All right, take it up to 100 feet.

35:59.856 --> 36:02.858
This might be the ultimate party foul.

36:02.860 --> 36:05.094
I think there might actually be
some credence to this myth

36:05.096 --> 36:07.062
because when I'm drinking a lot of beer,

36:07.064 --> 36:08.364
gravity affects me more.

36:08.366 --> 36:11.066
All right, this is light beer
versus regular beer

36:11.068 --> 36:12.168
dropped from 100 feet.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.869
Are you guys ready?

36:13.871 --> 36:15.838
In 3...2...1...

36:18.141 --> 36:19.241
Whoo!

36:19.243 --> 36:21.510
Now it's a party!

36:21.512 --> 36:24.180
As predicted, they pretty much
fell at the same rate.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.881
Fell at the same rate

36:25.883 --> 36:27.816
and hit the ground at the same time.

36:27.818 --> 36:31.020
But just to be sure, the guys go again,

36:31.022 --> 36:33.923
this time with bottles instead of cans.

36:35.525 --> 36:37.927
Wow! Whoa!

36:37.929 --> 36:41.530
And the high-speed confirms
the expected result.

36:41.532 --> 36:44.967
Both sets of six-packs have
the same shape and mass,

36:44.969 --> 36:48.370
and with no resulting difference
in air resistance,

36:48.372 --> 36:52.041
they were always gonna fall
with the same acceleration.

36:53.243 --> 36:55.444
And that's because...

36:55.446 --> 36:56.512
Gravity, man.

36:56.514 --> 36:59.048
It's not just a good idea. It's the law.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.616
But Kari, Grant, and Tory

37:00.618 --> 37:02.885
don't want to take the word of Adam

37:02.887 --> 37:05.454
or lesser names in physics,
like Galileo and Newton.

37:05.456 --> 37:07.790
Ohh!

37:08.793 --> 37:11.026
Like any good scientists,

37:11.028 --> 37:13.229
they want to test gravity themselves

37:13.231 --> 37:15.464
by, you know, dropping stuff.

37:15.466 --> 37:18.033
- Ohh!
- Now that was gorgeous!

37:18.035 --> 37:20.502
And after a sufficiently varied
sample size...

37:20.504 --> 37:21.870
So, I was sitting there wondering,

37:21.872 --> 37:23.872
"what could we drop next?"

37:23.874 --> 37:25.674
And then it came to me.

37:28.478 --> 37:32.881
it turns out that
gravity is indeed confirmed.

37:32.883 --> 37:35.684
There's time for
one last mailbag question.

37:35.686 --> 37:39.288
And as the most often asked, it's a doozy.

37:39.290 --> 37:40.723
"Dear MythBusters, what has been"

37:40.725 --> 37:42.524
"your most embarrassing moment
on the show?"

37:42.526 --> 37:43.692
Ohh!

37:43.694 --> 37:46.228
You know, unsurprisingly,
there have been many...

37:46.230 --> 37:48.097
- You ready?
- Oh, yeah.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.199
Like when I was trying
to beat the motion detector

37:50.201 --> 37:51.233
in my underwear...

37:51.235 --> 37:53.335
Uh...

37:53.337 --> 37:54.670
Put your clothes back on!

37:54.672 --> 37:56.205
...vomiting on camera.

37:58.842 --> 38:00.409
You know, for me, it was probably

38:00.411 --> 38:02.177
wearing a bra on national television.

38:02.179 --> 38:03.946
It seemed like good idea at the time.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.381
Not so much now.

38:05.383 --> 38:07.316
- Well, you made it look good, though.
- Well, thank you.

38:07.318 --> 38:09.551
Is this as disturbing as I think it is?

38:09.553 --> 38:12.154
It's even more disturbing
than you think it is.

38:12.156 --> 38:14.223
Trying to jump over a wagon on my bike.

38:14.225 --> 38:15.491
Ohh!

38:15.493 --> 38:17.359
I thought that was gonna go well.

38:17.361 --> 38:19.361
- That was pretty embarrassing.
- A little embarrassing.

38:19.363 --> 38:20.496
I'm okay.

38:20.498 --> 38:21.730
He was <i>physically</i> okay,

38:21.732 --> 38:23.232
but his pride wasn't.

38:23.234 --> 38:24.833
And as for Kari, well,

38:24.835 --> 38:27.102
she's got this contest all wrapped up.

38:27.104 --> 38:30.172
Okay, okay. I got both of you
beat hands down.

38:30.174 --> 38:34.176
Remember when we tried to test
"do pretty girls pass gas,"

38:34.178 --> 38:36.312
and they got me to do it just
because they called me pretty?

38:36.314 --> 38:38.213
Oh, do I?

38:38.215 --> 38:40.949
Luckily, that never actually saw
the light of day

38:40.951 --> 38:43.719
because they decided
not to put it in the episode.

38:43.721 --> 38:45.521
Actually, the producers have said

38:45.523 --> 38:48.057
that they're ready to air
that part of the episode.

38:48.059 --> 38:50.092
- Shut up! No!
- Yeah!

38:50.094 --> 38:52.194
No! No!

38:52.196 --> 38:54.330
That's right, America. Get ready.

38:55.999 --> 38:58.200
Yep, way back in episode 48,

38:58.202 --> 39:01.270
Adam and Jamie tested
a series of fun-filled,

39:01.272 --> 39:04.640
not-so-fragrant facts about flatulence.

39:04.642 --> 39:06.008
Hey, we got one!

39:09.246 --> 39:11.013
But for reasons of taste,

39:11.015 --> 39:12.915
not to mention
the excruciating embarrassment

39:12.917 --> 39:15.484
it would have caused Kari,

39:15.486 --> 39:18.554
one malodorous mini myth was held back...

39:18.556 --> 39:19.888
until now.

39:19.890 --> 39:22.458
So, pretty girls don't pass gas.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.559
That's the myth.

39:23.561 --> 39:25.594
I wonder where we'll find a pretty girl.

39:25.596 --> 39:26.695
Here's one.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.197
I'm already blushing right now.

39:28.199 --> 39:31.233
But when other people see this,

39:31.235 --> 39:35.637
I'm going to sleep with my
covers over my head for a week.

39:37.274 --> 39:40.876
While Kari mentally
prepares for public mortification,

39:40.878 --> 39:44.947
Adam prepares the experimental
flatus apparatus...

39:44.949 --> 39:48.016
a pair of attractive, gas-proof pants

39:48.018 --> 39:50.219
with two detection devices.

39:50.221 --> 39:54.423
I added a pocket for
this hydrogen sulfide meter,

39:54.425 --> 39:58.093
and I also added a pocket for a microphone

39:58.095 --> 40:00.262
that she will wear right here.

40:00.264 --> 40:02.364
And we're piping it through our stereo

40:02.366 --> 40:05.834
so we can hear whatever she's gonna do.

40:05.836 --> 40:07.970
I'm gonna test it right now.

40:11.542 --> 40:14.376
There you go. Works like a charm.

40:14.378 --> 40:17.913
"Charm" isn't the word
we're looking for, Adam.

40:17.915 --> 40:22.017
And here you go. Flatus-detection pants.

40:22.019 --> 40:23.919
Nurturing thoughts of revenge...

40:23.921 --> 40:28.056
Get them back some day.
I really will.

40:28.058 --> 40:31.293
Kari gets suited up
for her bottom burp business.

40:31.295 --> 40:33.495
These are hot!

40:33.497 --> 40:35.063
They may be hot,

40:35.065 --> 40:37.966
but after going about her day,
according to Kari,

40:37.968 --> 40:40.836
it's the flatus-detection device
that's at fault

40:40.838 --> 40:42.404
and not her.

40:42.406 --> 40:45.741
- I would be happy...
- that is a... false alarm.

40:45.743 --> 40:48.343
That is n... pissing me off.

40:48.345 --> 40:49.978
I have to talk to Adam about this design.

40:49.980 --> 40:52.614
With the
hydrogen-sulfide detector defunct,

40:52.616 --> 40:54.917
it's over to the mike and loudspeakers.

40:54.919 --> 40:58.520
But a full day goes by,
and our designated pretty girl

40:58.522 --> 41:01.356
hasn't uttered one butt cheek peep.

41:01.358 --> 41:04.259
I have a feeling that
the minute the cameras go off

41:04.261 --> 41:06.929
and everybody leaves,
then maybe it'll happen.

41:06.931 --> 41:11.567
I think that maybe I'm just
anxious and a little shy.

41:11.569 --> 41:13.235
That's totally unacceptable.

41:13.237 --> 41:15.204
You have to generate one on camera.

41:15.206 --> 41:17.206
You can't just say it happened yesterday.

41:17.208 --> 41:19.341
You have to do it.
It's totally unacceptable.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.080
Whoo! Give me a high five!

41:29.352 --> 41:32.588
All right. Thanks very much, Kari.

41:32.590 --> 41:34.690
I am so embarrassed right now!

41:34.692 --> 41:36.625
I don't even know what to do with this.

41:36.627 --> 41:38.160
My family's gonna watch this.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.229
Oh, my God.

41:40.231 --> 41:43.765
The status of this myth
that girls do not toot

41:43.767 --> 41:46.568
is busted.

41:46.570 --> 41:48.570
I am a human.

41:48.572 --> 41:50.205
All girls are humans.

41:51.475 --> 41:54.409
And we pass gas just as the boys do.

41:58.081 --> 42:01.316
Oh, can I take the microphone
out of my butt now?

42:03.487 --> 42:05.921
Yep, that's about
as embarrassing as it gets.

42:07.224 --> 42:09.925
Kari wins the red-faced olympics
hands down.

42:09.927 --> 42:13.727
With almost 20 suggestions,
questions, and mini myths

42:13.752 --> 42:16.652
tackled, answered and tested,

42:16.677 --> 42:19.777
it's time to put the mailbag
away until next time,

42:19.802 --> 42:22.902
and finish with the obligatory bang.

42:22.927 --> 42:24.127
- Whoo!
- Whooooo ho hoo!
