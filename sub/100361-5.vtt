00:48.173 --> 00:51.384
And so, without further dramatic pause...

00:51.468 --> 00:52.802
Oh, one more.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.931
I give you the...

00:57.849 --> 00:58.850
Rise Up!

00:58.933 --> 01:00.810
[gasps] Who is she?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.979
She's chic. She's sleek.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.981
She'll cradle those cheeks.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.775
She's sexy, yet functional.

01:06.858 --> 01:09.194
She's fun, yet mature.

01:09.277 --> 01:13.698
She's the Helen Mirren
of plumbing fixtures.

01:13.782 --> 01:14.783
Crowd noise.

01:14.866 --> 01:18.620
[hushed cheering sound]

01:18.995 --> 01:20.205
Available...

01:21.206 --> 01:23.291
in executive black,

01:23.374 --> 01:26.294
silver fox, and rose gold!

01:27.670 --> 01:29.005
Hello, Grace.

01:29.756 --> 01:34.010
Did I get clipped by a forklift
in Stapler World for my own amusement?

01:34.469 --> 01:37.555
I thought you were excited
about this toilet.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.640
I am.

01:39.265 --> 01:43.061
I'm sorry, Frankie.
I'm just a little distracted.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.771
Hey, can we take a coffee break?

01:44.854 --> 01:47.190
[slight chuckle]
Who died and made you Frankie?

01:47.273 --> 01:49.234
This whole day has been a break.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.527
Are you okay?

01:51.820 --> 01:54.906
You know what? Forget the break.
Let's get back to work.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.574
Oh, must be about sex

01:56.658 --> 01:58.827
if you don't want to talk about it
this much.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.578
How did you know?

02:00.662 --> 02:03.373
I didn't. You just told me.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.209
[laughs]

02:07.794 --> 02:08.837
Out with it.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.171
Okay, fine.

02:11.172 --> 02:14.175
Have you ever experienced yawning?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.677
[slight chuckle] Have I.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.345
During sex?

02:17.929 --> 02:21.724
No. If anything, we're both
desperately trying to catch our breath.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.644
-Yeah.
-Why? Who's tub-thumpin' on empty?

02:25.478 --> 02:28.439
I think Nick yawned. Last night.

02:28.523 --> 02:29.899
What do you mean, you think?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.610
Well, I think it was
one of those internal,

02:32.694 --> 02:35.697
swallowing-your-boredom kind of yawns.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.867
Like when Bud talks to you
about his drone.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.201
Oh, that's bad.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.537
You know who would really like
to hear about this?

02:42.620 --> 02:47.417
Yeah. Frankie, I told you,
I'm not gonna do a sex podcast with you.

02:47.750 --> 02:48.793
Nick.

02:48.877 --> 02:52.714
Didn't you just commit to being a hundred
percent truthful with each other?

02:52.797 --> 02:56.259
Suppose the truth is
that sex with me has gotten boring?

02:56.342 --> 02:59.095
I wouldn't know.
You won't let me see you perform.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.305
[exhales]

03:00.388 --> 03:01.514
Break's over.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.767
You know, I'm sure
there's probably a good explanation.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.561
Like he's tired.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.980
But you won't know unless you ask.

03:09.063 --> 03:12.483
Yeah, but if I ask, I might find out
something that I don't want to know.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.320
If you can't talk to your husband
about sex,

03:15.403 --> 03:18.573
then you really aren't doing things
differently this time.

03:18.656 --> 03:21.201
[exhales] Oh, my God, you are right.

03:23.494 --> 03:26.164
Wait a minute, you were hit by a forklift?

03:26.247 --> 03:28.041
Ah, you should see the other guy.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.751
[cackling]

03:30.126 --> 03:31.920
No, but I'm hurt pretty bad.

03:32.879 --> 03:36.382
[Sol] So there's you, me, the boys,

03:36.466 --> 03:40.470
Allison, and the cute friend
Allison's bringing for Coyote.

03:40.678 --> 03:46.643
So, that's 20 bread cubes per person.
How many bread cubes in a loaf?

03:47.185 --> 03:48.186
Seventy.

03:48.269 --> 03:50.313
I know you have your heart set on fondue,

03:50.396 --> 03:53.650
but have you considered
literally anything else?

03:53.733 --> 03:56.694
-But you love cheese.
-Not in communal form.

03:57.987 --> 04:01.616
This dinner's a surprise setup.
They're always awkward.

04:01.699 --> 04:04.535
Fondue's the ultimate
conversation starter.

04:05.161 --> 04:08.206
Asking where the bathroom is
is not a conversation.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.958
And speaking of conversations,

04:10.041 --> 04:12.961
have you thought about telling the boys
what's going on with you?

04:13.044 --> 04:14.045
Tonight?

04:14.420 --> 04:16.256
How do you propose I do that?

04:16.965 --> 04:19.717
"Hi, Allison's friend. This is Coyote.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.428
Cool top. I've got cancer."

04:23.054 --> 04:27.225
Sol, you're going under the knife,
and you haven't told your family.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.060
Because I know how they'll react.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.730
Coyote will spin out. Bud will fret.

04:33.022 --> 04:35.942
And you know that scary dream you have
where Frankie moves in?

04:36.025 --> 04:39.195
But Sol, you can't hide being sick
from them.

04:39.279 --> 04:43.032
I'm not. I'm just waiting
until after the procedure.

04:43.283 --> 04:47.787
I don't need three people
with premium WebMD accounts

04:47.870 --> 04:51.582
panicking at me
when I'm trying to focus on my health.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.460
Wouldn't you want to know
if one of them was having surgery?

04:54.919 --> 04:56.879
My body, my choice.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.091
-But, Sol--
-Robert, this isn't your cancer.

05:02.593 --> 05:03.594
Go.

05:05.179 --> 05:08.975
You need to motor if you're gonna make
both cheese shops and the beach house.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.437
Why am I going to the beach house?

05:12.895 --> 05:14.355
Frankie, just pick one.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.275
This is tricky, 'cause it's a setup.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.194
This fondue pot says "family fun,"

05:20.278 --> 05:23.489
and this one says, "Oh, yeah,
we're all gonna get laid tonight."

05:23.573 --> 05:24.991
Just pick. I don't care.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.368
-I'll pretend we didn't hear that.
-[sighs]

05:27.452 --> 05:29.370
Okay, fine. I'll take this one.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.122
This one is missing a fork,

05:31.205 --> 05:33.666
-and it has a leak.
-Well, why don't you throw it out?

05:33.750 --> 05:36.794
Would you throw out a child
who's missing a fork and had a leak?

05:36.878 --> 05:38.504
Frankie, please, I'm not in the mood!

05:39.589 --> 05:41.632
I'm sorry. That wasn't for you.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.092
Who was it for?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.720
No one. I've had a bad morning.

05:45.803 --> 05:48.639
I really can't talk about it. Okay?
I'll just take the sex pot.

05:49.390 --> 05:53.561
Sorry, the cost of one fondue pot
is one secret.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.275
Ah. Wait a second.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.904
Sol told me about dragging you
to the doctor for your boat trip.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.530
Is it...?

06:04.614 --> 06:06.199
Did you get bad news?

06:06.282 --> 06:08.785
No, Frankie, I didn't get bad news.

06:08.868 --> 06:09.952
Did Sol?

06:10.036 --> 06:11.704
Oh, wait a second.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.082
Oh, my God, is Sol sick?

06:15.166 --> 06:17.460
I wasn't supposed to say anything.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.337
What is it? What's going on?

06:20.213 --> 06:22.131
He has prostate cancer.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.509
[exhales] Oh, my God.

06:24.592 --> 06:28.554
But it's treatable. We caught it early.
And he'll be fine. He just needs surgery.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.182
I've got to call him. I've got to move in.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.976
No, no! No! See, that's why
I couldn't say anything.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.312
He doesn't want to upset everybody.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.398
[whispers] Please don't tell him
I said anything.

06:38.481 --> 06:41.025
So you want me to sit here
with this information

06:41.109 --> 06:42.985
and pretend like I don't know anything?

06:43.069 --> 06:44.070
Mm-hmm.

06:44.529 --> 06:45.738
Thanks for the pot.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.448
[door opens, shuts]

06:50.660 --> 06:52.412
Need anything before I head home?

06:52.995 --> 06:54.956
Oh, actually, you're gonna love this.

06:55.039 --> 06:57.792
I need you to stay late and help me
with the distribution reports.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.002
What? Why would I love that?

07:00.086 --> 07:01.712
Because your kids live at your home.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.006
Okay, but the reports aren't due
for two weeks.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.009
And, I'll have you know,
I really like three of my kids.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.805
Yeah, I couldn't help hearing,
as I was eavesdropping.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.265
Shall I cancel my laser facial

07:12.348 --> 07:14.350
and your dinner plans
with Barry and the lesbians?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.018
Yes. And Adam,

07:16.102 --> 07:19.480
can you get me the distro reports
that I asked for 20 years ago?

07:19.814 --> 07:20.898
Yes, sir.

07:22.316 --> 07:23.317
[exhales]

07:23.818 --> 07:28.406
So, why are you using me
to get out of dinner with your boyfriend?

07:28.489 --> 07:29.699
Erin and Liz are pregnant,

07:29.782 --> 07:33.453
and I can't spend four hours celebrating
babies and Barry's powerful sperm.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.080
Reports and takeout menus.

07:36.164 --> 07:39.625
Just get Hoagie Hole.
I'm one punch away from free chips.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.252
Oh, what an exciting time in your life.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.634
That's big news about Barry.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.595
You wanna talk about it?

07:50.678 --> 07:53.014
-What the fuck?
-What?

07:54.098 --> 07:57.518
It's a cover letter for a job application
addressed to Planet Organics.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.187
Somebody must have just left this
in the printer.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.022
-Who?
-It's not signed.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.899
I'll just have to call the police.

08:02.982 --> 08:03.983
Brianna!

08:04.942 --> 08:07.487
Come on. People apply for other jobs.

08:08.029 --> 08:12.158
But who would be stupid and/or bold enough
to leave this in the company printer?

08:12.241 --> 08:13.910
Yeah, well, you better find
some arugula.

08:13.993 --> 08:17.205
Okay? Because if Brianna isn't happy,
nobody's happy.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.041
Yeah, welcome to my life, Shayna.

08:26.547 --> 08:30.593
My gal, a cocktail,
a couple piles of cured meat.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.386
-Heaven at last.
-Hmm.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.889
Are they running you ragged
at that office?

08:34.972 --> 08:37.183
Nah. I'm top of the heap, baby.

08:37.266 --> 08:38.976
That must be exhausting.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.729
Nope. It's like the Iditarod.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.691
The guy on the sled gets the credit,
but all he's really doing is chillin' out

08:45.775 --> 08:47.735
-and whippin' dogs.
-[slight chuckle]

08:47.818 --> 08:51.239
But it was a long, long week, huh?

08:51.948 --> 08:55.368
Okay, I feel like
I'm with a passive-aggressive hypnotist.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.953
Why do you want me to be tired?

08:58.079 --> 08:59.497
Because you yawned.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.957
When? Just now?

09:01.457 --> 09:03.584
No. Last night.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.171
-During sex.
-Really?

09:08.506 --> 09:10.132
That doesn't sound like me.

09:10.758 --> 09:14.220
Maybe you just misinterpreted
one of my, you know, faces.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.806
I know what a yawn is.

09:16.889 --> 09:21.394
Look. I don't know what you think you saw,
but I swear I didn't yawn.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.480
Sex with you is my favorite thing.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.898
I thought your favorite thing was

09:25.982 --> 09:28.859
when someone famous rings the bell
at the stock exchange.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.903
Well, they're both big turn-ons.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.363
Really.

09:33.364 --> 09:34.824
We're fine.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.411
[exhales]

09:38.828 --> 09:40.162
Oh, boy.

09:40.705 --> 09:41.622
[chuckles]

09:42.999 --> 09:45.668
For a minute there,
I-I was really spinning out.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.128
Don't spin out.

09:47.211 --> 09:49.380
We're good, I promise.

09:49.463 --> 09:50.298
[exhales]

09:50.590 --> 09:52.216
And I love you.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.178
[stifled yawns]

09:56.262 --> 09:57.722
Wh-What are you doing?

09:57.805 --> 09:58.889
Nothing.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.308
Oh, my God!

10:00.391 --> 10:02.560
-You're doing it again.
-No.

10:02.643 --> 10:05.187
What I just did was a...

10:05.938 --> 10:07.440
a silent cheer.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.192
[Coyote] Hey, guys.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.194
Wow.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.489
Something smells amazing.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.158
Hey, kiddo. You're early.

10:17.700 --> 10:21.037
Yeah, sorry. Um, I was kind of hoping
I could talk to you about something.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.455
Of course. What's up?

10:22.955 --> 10:23.789
[exhales]

10:23.873 --> 10:27.293
Do you remember Jessica? Bud's old
girlfriend, the one he had a tough time--

10:27.376 --> 10:30.254
-You slept with her?
-Wow, you got there fast.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.756
I'm not new here.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.257
Does Bud know?

10:33.674 --> 10:35.259
No, not yet.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.761
I mean, it just happened.

10:36.844 --> 10:39.722
I mean, I don't even know what it is yet.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.599
Do I have to tell him?

10:43.267 --> 10:44.310
Well...

10:44.935 --> 10:46.437
it's your personal life.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.522
It's also your family.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.525
It's been a long time since they dated.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.736
Bud's moved on. He's married.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.655
But don't you think
he has a right to know?

10:56.030 --> 10:59.408
And don't you think he'd want to know
before it's too late?

10:59.784 --> 11:00.618
What?

11:00.701 --> 11:03.913
Robert's been breathing
a lot of Sterno fumes.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.248
Tell him when you're ready.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.418
Why upset him... unless it's serious.

11:09.502 --> 11:13.005
Maybe because I really, really want it
to be serious.

11:13.089 --> 11:13.923
Oh.

11:14.298 --> 11:15.466
[doorbell rings]

11:15.883 --> 11:17.593
That'll be Bud, Allison...

11:18.469 --> 11:19.887
and Cassidy.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.474
-Oh, shit. Cassidy.
-Who's Cassidy?

11:23.557 --> 11:26.143
The girl you're on a date with right now.

11:29.188 --> 11:32.942
Fucking Adam! Gonna rip him
side-by-side new ones.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.611
Or instead of doing that--

11:35.695 --> 11:39.573
No, Mal, I'm not gonna key
a compact car. It's too sad.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.701
Bri, pause for a minute.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.327
Adam does a lot.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.871
He's been here a long time,
and he takes a lot of abuse.

11:45.955 --> 11:49.917
So? Does he think he's the only person
who can help me avoid Barry's lesbians?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.336
Or memorize my cycle?
Or break in my shoes?

11:52.420 --> 11:55.047
Oh, my God, Mal, he can't leave me.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.426
-So get him to stay.
-How? Do you have any strong tape?

11:58.509 --> 12:00.636
-Brianna.
-You're right. Scotch tape will do.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.138
He only goes to the gym to flirt.

12:02.221 --> 12:05.057
Did you ever think that your employees
might be more loyal

12:05.141 --> 12:08.436
if you nurtured them
instead of terrorized them?

12:08.519 --> 12:11.105
[laughs]

12:13.315 --> 12:14.608
Oh, you're serious.

12:15.109 --> 12:18.028
-[laughs]
-Get it? It's a capital city joke.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.783
Um, so how do you...
how do you know Allison?

12:22.867 --> 12:23.868
We were roommates.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.244
A billion years ago.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.121
God, that place was tiny.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.415
Oh, it seemed huge to me, but, you know,

12:29.498 --> 12:31.500
-my first apartment was an iron lung.
-Hmm.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.377
[clears throat] Cassidy plays violin

12:33.461 --> 12:35.296
-in the San Diego Symphony.
-[Coyote] Oh.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.839
And Coyote teaches music

12:36.922 --> 12:38.632
-at a middle school.
-Oh!

12:38.716 --> 12:42.720
I know that was meant to be
about similarities, but somehow, it hurt.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.389
-Eh, I'm only second chair.
-Oh, what a loser.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.515
[giggles]

12:47.391 --> 12:50.227
Crudités!
Get 'em while they're not fondue.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.270
Stop.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.355
Cassidy, I forgot to ask.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.399
You like melted cheese, right?

12:55.858 --> 12:58.235
Uh, only in enormous quantities.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.613
-[door opens, closes]
-[Frankie] Hello! Robert?

13:00.696 --> 13:02.573
Sol? Carl?

13:02.656 --> 13:05.993
-You didn't tell me Frankie was coming.
-[whispers] I didn't know she was.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.706
Hey, Mom. Why?

13:11.165 --> 13:13.542
Wow, I get to meet all the parents.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.795
As I always say, the more, the weirder.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.755
I'm not here to be weird.

13:18.255 --> 13:22.426
I'm just here
because Robert forgot his bowler hat.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.181
[slight chuckle] It's a thing I'm trying.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.518
Ta-da. You know what,
I'm glad you're here,

13:30.601 --> 13:33.354
because I have your hat
in the other room. Come with me.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.484
-That hat is not working.
-[Bud chuckles]

13:44.782 --> 13:46.242
Where's my hat, man?

13:46.700 --> 13:48.452
No, Frankie, that was just--

13:48.828 --> 13:50.663
-Hold this.
-Why are you here?

13:50.746 --> 13:53.874
Don't worry, I'm not gonna tell Sol
I know anything.

13:54.416 --> 13:58.838
I'm just here to start
a few teeny-weeny healing rituals for him.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.465
You won't even notice me.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.926
Because your hat ruse was so smooth?

14:04.510 --> 14:07.054
Look, I'm just gonna burn a little sage,

14:07.972 --> 14:10.683
hide a few dozen healing crystals.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.935
Frankie, you of all people
should understand.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.980
When you had your stroke, you wanted
to deal with it in your own way.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.523
-This is different.
-How?

14:17.606 --> 14:18.774
It just is.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.318
This is happening, pal.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.153
Wear the hat or don't.

14:24.572 --> 14:27.199
But get out of my way. Om.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.829
Remember, be nurturing.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.080
I'm gonna be nurturing.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.707
I'm gonna chew up that cover letter

14:34.790 --> 14:37.710
and spit it
into his little baby bird mouth.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.421
Maybe don't mention the letter.

14:40.504 --> 14:43.424
Appreciation is more effective
if it's spontaneous.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.551
Got it. Be nice.
Get the fuck out of my office.

14:45.634 --> 14:46.594
All right.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.264
You, uh, wanted to see me?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.439
-[Adam clears throat]
-[Brianna] Adam.

14:59.648 --> 15:03.652
You've been here a long time, and...

15:03.944 --> 15:06.697
we've been through a lot together.

15:06.780 --> 15:10.117
Are you okay?
I can see a lot of your teeth.

15:10.200 --> 15:14.288
I'm fine. And moreover, you're fine.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.749
In fact, you're good.

15:16.832 --> 15:17.958
Okay?

15:18.042 --> 15:20.044
You're good at your job.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.087
And, um...

15:22.671 --> 15:24.548
your hair never moves.

15:24.632 --> 15:28.010
-What?
-And you-- you always have gum.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.512
Do you need something? Is it blood?

15:31.555 --> 15:33.057
Damn it, Adam. Okay.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.144
I know I take you for granted,

15:37.227 --> 15:39.355
and I tell myself it's because
I think of you<i> </i>less as an employee

15:39.438 --> 15:42.524
and more as a friend,
but if I really were your friend,

15:43.192 --> 15:47.821
I'd tell you you deserve much better
than the way your asshole boss treats you.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.242
Please don't leave Say Grace. We need you.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.328
I need you.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.830
You're not supposed to ovulate
until the tenth.

15:56.914 --> 16:00.584
Shut up, or you won't get this small raise
and meaningless new title.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.461
-Wait, really?
-You earned it.

16:03.087 --> 16:07.633
Managing director of Ask-Mallory-I-Forget.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.426
[shaky exhale]

16:11.553 --> 16:14.139
Thank you. Really. [clears throat]

16:14.223 --> 16:17.184
I'm gonna go update
my Grindr profile right now. Okay.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.814
And throw out
that stupid cover letter, okay?

16:21.897 --> 16:22.773
What cover letter?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.863
-Okay, okay, I yawned just then.
-Aha!

16:30.239 --> 16:31.448
But I didn't yawn in bed.

16:31.532 --> 16:35.160
And even if I did, which I didn't,
what's the big deal?

16:35.244 --> 16:37.162
If it was just a yawn,
that would be one thing.

16:39.790 --> 16:43.127
Let me put this in terms
that you will understand.

16:43.419 --> 16:46.213
-Coupled with the other data, the--
-Data?

16:46.672 --> 16:49.883
Do you have any idea how many times
we've had sex in the last three weeks?

16:49.967 --> 16:51.802
-What?
-Five and a half.

16:51.885 --> 16:55.597
I know the night you're referring to,
and that still counts as one.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.976
Well, fine. Six. Still not great.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.602
So you're counting now?

17:00.686 --> 17:02.396
Oh, my God.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.356
Numbers don't lie, Nick.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.025
Why are you measuring sex at all?

17:06.108 --> 17:09.236
Because it's an essential
relationship metric.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.863
This is insane.

17:11.947 --> 17:13.365
And I got news for you.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.076
None of this is gonna help me
get my numbers up.

17:19.705 --> 17:20.998
[Bud chuckles]

17:22.958 --> 17:26.128
-So, isn't Cass great?
-She's terrific.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.005
-[chuckles]
-Shouldn't we get back in there?

17:28.088 --> 17:31.717
Oh, yeah, totally. I figured I'd propose
a, uh, Sunday mini-golf double date,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.218
seeing as we have a foursome.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.304
Bud, I'm not feeling it.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.639
Oh, that's cool,
Fun'n'Junk has go-karts, too.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.808
No, I mean I'm not feeling Cassidy.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.605
Are you serious? I had to beg Allison
to let you meet this girl.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.023
Yeah, and-- and I appreciate that.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.108
Well, quit telling me
you want to meet someone nice

17:48.192 --> 17:51.153
when what you want to do
is chase tail and nail cater waitresses.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.031
Okay, before you say
something else mean...

17:55.908 --> 17:57.409
I'm seeing somebody.

17:58.368 --> 18:02.414
[chuckles] Hold on. You text me
when you perfectly toast a bagel,

18:02.498 --> 18:04.291
but not to tell me
that you're seeing someone?

18:04.374 --> 18:07.336
You acted weird when I told you
I bumped into Jessica.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.630
Well, what does that have to do with this?

18:13.383 --> 18:14.968
I'm seeing her.

18:19.681 --> 18:20.599
[Robert] You're done?

18:20.682 --> 18:21.892
-[Frankie] Yes.
-Good.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.977
With this room.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.521
-[sighs]
-[door opens]

18:26.105 --> 18:30.067
I'm setting the table. Frankie,
if you guys have resolved your hat thing,

18:30.150 --> 18:31.527
would you like to stay for dinner?

18:31.610 --> 18:33.987
I would love that. Thank you.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.198
Sol, the last time I checked,

18:36.281 --> 18:39.118
the girls were running
dangerously low on jicama.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.411
You should have told me right away!

18:42.496 --> 18:44.665
-[door closes]
-Frankie, you can't stay.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.583
I know this is scary for you,

18:46.667 --> 18:50.003
and I get wanting to do something,
but you can't fix Sol with rituals.

18:50.087 --> 18:53.173
Oh, so says the guy
who goes to Mass once a week.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.675
Twice this week, actually.

18:54.758 --> 18:58.303
I guess we're both relying on faith...
in something.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.430
I suppose you're right.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.142
[sighs] I gotta be honest.

19:04.184 --> 19:06.812
My faith isn't doing a damn thing for me.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.149
-Maybe mine can help.
-[slight chuckle]

19:10.232 --> 19:12.276
Got anything for crippling guilt?

19:12.776 --> 19:14.611
You've come to the right faith.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.905
Jessica-who-broke-my-heart-Jessica?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.366
Jessica-from-20-years-ago-Jessica.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.243
Like that makes it
less of a knife in my back?

19:21.326 --> 19:25.038
That's a little dramatic.
At most, it was a gentle back-forking.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.249
What are you doing in here?
You're being rude to Cass.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.376
-Forget Cass.
-What? Why?

19:29.793 --> 19:31.503
Because he's seeing somebody.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.132
Why didn't you tell us this
before I convinced my hottest friend

19:35.215 --> 19:37.134
to come eat Sol's grody disco food?

19:37.217 --> 19:38.844
Because it's Jessica.

19:38.927 --> 19:39.970
Oh.

19:42.097 --> 19:43.473
Who the fuck is Jessica?

19:46.101 --> 19:50.772
But if Elke fell down some stairs,
you'd be first chair violinist?

19:50.856 --> 19:52.316
Yeah, I guess so.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.114
The word "jicama"

20:00.115 --> 20:04.912
comes from the old Peruvian
for "ground apple."

20:05.537 --> 20:08.415
You told me. But now I'll retain it.

20:24.848 --> 20:28.685
-So you gave Adam a small raise.
-For nothing.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.647
-I gave him a small raise for nothing!
-[sighs]

20:31.730 --> 20:34.650
But don't you feel better
knowing you made him feel appreciated?

20:34.733 --> 20:37.569
It's not just about the money,
it's the principle.

20:38.528 --> 20:41.073
And the box of clicky pens
I thoughtlessly agreed to.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.574
He draws a hard line.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.660
And now we're back to square one
with the letter!

20:44.743 --> 20:47.996
[stammers] Who is the Judas?
Sharon? Erica?

20:48.830 --> 20:51.583
The guy whose name I always forget?
[whispers] It could be anyone.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.293
If it could be anyone,

20:53.377 --> 20:56.505
that means you think everyone here
feels under-appreciated.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.924
Well, I'm not made of pens.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.302
And what has everybody done
to earn my appreciation,

21:02.386 --> 21:05.430
besides their jobs,
which they are paid for?

21:05.889 --> 21:08.767
I don't know.
Deal with your management style?

21:09.059 --> 21:10.644
-Stay late?
-Okay.

21:11.186 --> 21:15.941
Do nonsense things for you
instead of putting their kids to bed?

21:20.195 --> 21:21.321
It's you?

21:23.991 --> 21:25.659
Oh, my God. It's you.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.664
I don't know about this, but I feel silly.

21:30.747 --> 21:34.710
And I feel pretty sure this is blasphemy,
but here we are.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.713
Bless me, Robert, for I have sinned.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.758
What do I do now? Put a quarter in?

21:41.842 --> 21:44.678
No. You list your transgressions.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.555
And then I'm off the hook?

21:47.055 --> 21:48.890
Well, I'm not qualified
to give absolution.

21:48.974 --> 21:52.602
This is more an exercise in honesty.

21:52.936 --> 21:54.604
Okay, let's see.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.233
I cheated at the Jumble yesterday.

21:58.942 --> 22:00.360
Okay, every day.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.572
I use Bud's HBO login,

22:04.114 --> 22:08.243
even though I know it's taking bread
from the mouths of content creators.

22:08.994 --> 22:13.415
I never correct the guy at Yogurt Cantina
who thinks I'm blind.

22:13.832 --> 22:16.043
Frankie. Come on.

22:20.505 --> 22:25.177
And a few years ago, when my ex-husband
left me for someone else...

22:28.138 --> 22:31.266
I wished that he would get cancer.

22:36.146 --> 22:39.858
So do you want to sentence me
to burn in hellfire forever?

22:40.150 --> 22:43.695
Wow, have you never seen this before?
Not even in the movies?

22:46.406 --> 22:48.909
Frankie, it's okay.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.953
You're human. You were angry.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.373
But I specifically wished...

22:55.123 --> 22:58.251
for something in the groinal area.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.838
And maybe I did a spell.

23:03.548 --> 23:07.302
What if my anger was so powerful,
it had powers?

23:07.719 --> 23:11.056
Grace told me she wished I'd died.
She didn't mean it.

23:11.139 --> 23:15.060
Neither did I. I would never wish
something bad on him.

23:15.852 --> 23:18.980
Other than the time
I wished something bad on him.

23:19.815 --> 23:25.404
Well, in my limited capacity to do so
as a layperson, I absolve you.

23:25.487 --> 23:28.198
And how long
till I actually feel absolved?

23:30.575 --> 23:32.786
I don't know. I'm still waiting myself.

23:32.869 --> 23:35.705
Don't feel guilty
for telling me about Sol.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.040
Oh, not that.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.209
Then what else is there?

23:39.626 --> 23:41.503
Layperson to layperson.

23:43.797 --> 23:45.090
Here, switch with me.

23:50.095 --> 23:50.929
[sighs]

23:51.805 --> 23:55.350
-[Robert clears throat]
-Go ahead. Unburden yourself, my child.

23:57.477 --> 23:58.895
It should have been me.

24:00.897 --> 24:03.358
The bad news should have been for me.

24:03.900 --> 24:07.320
I'm the one who was supposed to go first.

24:08.363 --> 24:11.658
I was never supposed to live without him.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.667
You know what? This one is for you.

24:21.126 --> 24:23.628
Some of my faith for some of yours.

24:24.921 --> 24:28.258
-Neither of you is going anywhere.
-[door opens]

24:28.341 --> 24:30.802
[Sol] What the hell is going on in here?

24:31.470 --> 24:35.932
Somehow I ended up on a date with Cassidy,
and we have nothing in common.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.517
Oh, Sol.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.022
You told her.

24:47.068 --> 24:48.069
You want an espresso?

24:48.153 --> 24:50.280
I've had a few today,
so I won't yawn during sex.

24:50.363 --> 24:53.450
But I may have a heart attack.
Hope that won't hurt our numbers.

24:53.533 --> 24:56.620
Why are you bent out of shape?
You're the yawner, not the yawn-ee.

24:56.703 --> 24:59.664
Well, it's not so great
being the yawner either.

24:59.748 --> 25:02.834
You think I want to feel
like I'm letting you down in that area?

25:02.918 --> 25:04.169
Who says you're letting me down?

25:04.252 --> 25:06.421
You just gave me
a shitty performance review!

25:06.505 --> 25:08.381
That wasn't supposed to make you feel bad.

25:08.465 --> 25:12.010
How could it not? You know what I never
liked about dating younger women?

25:12.093 --> 25:15.263
-They're too hot?
-No. The pressure to keep up.

25:15.347 --> 25:18.725
To have sex after ten.
Hell, to be awake after ten. I...

25:19.226 --> 25:21.520
I didn't think
I'd have to worry about that with you.

25:21.603 --> 25:24.856
Well, maybe I'm worried
because I know how this goes.

25:24.940 --> 25:28.276
In the beginning, it's two times a week,
then it's one time.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.947
Then it's only New Year's Eve
and St. Patrick's Day.

25:32.030 --> 25:34.241
Then only when <i>Guns of Navarone </i>is on TV.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.785
I've seen <i>Guns of Navarone </i>three times.

25:37.410 --> 25:39.621
-Well, this is a different relationship.
-[chuckles]

25:39.704 --> 25:41.206
I mean, for one thing, I'm not gay.

25:41.289 --> 25:44.834
I know. But it's the only thing I have
to compare you to.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.211
Which is good for me in...

25:47.003 --> 25:48.296
in a lot of ways.

25:48.755 --> 25:49.589
[exhales]

25:51.800 --> 25:53.301
Can we please...

25:54.761 --> 25:56.471
give each other a break?

25:57.430 --> 26:01.893
I was so excited about coming home
to you tonight and just hanging out.

26:01.977 --> 26:02.978
Mmm.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.146
I've never had that feeling before.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.565
Neither have I.

26:06.648 --> 26:09.484
I would rather have this
than all the relationships I've had

26:09.568 --> 26:10.819
-put together.
-[slight chuckle]

26:11.736 --> 26:12.946
Me too.

26:14.281 --> 26:17.701
I've never had a relationship
where I could even talk about this.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.453
-I think we're in one right now.
-Yeah.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.497
You know,
I like that I can tell you things

26:22.581 --> 26:25.041
and not be afraid
that you're gonna think less of me.

26:25.458 --> 26:26.626
Me too.

26:28.503 --> 26:31.840
So can we go to sleep now
and leave the math to the nerds?

26:33.174 --> 26:35.176
I'd love to. [slight chuckle]

26:40.432 --> 26:41.725
-Nick?
-Hmm?

26:42.183 --> 26:44.102
I think I'd like to be tied up.

26:44.644 --> 26:45.645
[clattering]

26:47.355 --> 26:48.732
I'll Postmates a headboard.

26:49.399 --> 26:51.901
-Alexa, dim the lights.
-[Alexa] <i>Okay.</i>

26:53.194 --> 26:55.614
[Nick] Just so you know,
my safe word is "Stop."

26:55.697 --> 26:57.449
[both laugh]

26:57.532 --> 26:58.950
[crickets chirping]

27:02.621 --> 27:03.955
[whimpers]

27:05.206 --> 27:07.751
This whole thing is about some girl
you dated 15 years ago?

27:07.834 --> 27:11.129
It was 18 years ago,
and she broke my heart.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.715
Do you realize
who you are talking to right now?

27:13.798 --> 27:17.010
Yeah, I-- I gotta admit, Bud,
it's not a hot look.

27:17.761 --> 27:18.887
[Allison] Cassidy, wait!

27:20.347 --> 27:23.099
-Where-- Where are you going?
-Yeah, we haven't even eaten yet.

27:23.183 --> 27:27.604
Right, but if I leave now, I can get home
in time to kill myself during <i>Kimmel.</i>

27:28.146 --> 27:31.399
-Wait! I'm coming with you.
-Uh, going with her where?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.568
Anywhere I don't have to listen
to my new husband

27:33.652 --> 27:36.321
-obsessing over an old girlfriend.
-I'm not obsessed with her.

27:36.404 --> 27:38.281
-Just obsessed with who she's dating.
-Yes. Wait.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.241
-That was the wrong answer.
-It was.

27:40.867 --> 27:44.162
Get home by ten and pay the sitter.
I'm gonna go get Cassidy wasted.

27:44.454 --> 27:45.580
Uh...

27:45.664 --> 27:47.415
I'm pretty drunk already.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.668
It was a lot of jicama talk.

27:53.296 --> 27:55.173
I didn't want you all to worry.

27:55.256 --> 27:59.177
[scoffs] Tough shit, homie.
That's what we're here for.

27:59.260 --> 28:02.055
So that all the worry
doesn't fall on you and Robert.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.641
Think of it like cutting a pie.

28:04.724 --> 28:05.725
I'm listening.

28:05.809 --> 28:09.396
Well, Robert takes a slice of worry.
I take a slice.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.773
The boys take a slice.

28:15.610 --> 28:18.113
The fact you're keeping it secret
means you know it's messed up.

28:18.196 --> 28:19.989
I was going to tell you.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.242
When? When you guys were having
your first baby together?

28:22.325 --> 28:24.744
Oh, like the baby you have with your wife?

28:24.828 --> 28:25.870
[scoffs]

28:25.954 --> 28:26.955
Where'd everybody go?

28:27.539 --> 28:29.124
Ask Coyote.

28:29.207 --> 28:30.792
I didn't do this. You did this.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.336
I didn't ask for Jessica
to come back into my life,

28:33.420 --> 28:36.589
and now I gotta explain this whole thing
to Allison when she's drunk.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.925
Bud knows about me and Jessica?

28:39.008 --> 28:42.554
What? Is there anyone in this family
who is not dating Jessica?

28:42.637 --> 28:44.806
Yeah, you! 'Cause you're married!

28:44.889 --> 28:47.350
-Oh, you're gonna throw that in my face?
-Please don't fight.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.060
Especially not now.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.938
What do you mean, "especially not now"?

28:52.021 --> 28:53.314
[Coyote] What's going on?

28:56.067 --> 28:58.486
Boys, let's go sit down.
