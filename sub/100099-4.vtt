00:01.262 --> 00:02.654
Previously on
Supergirl...

00:02.698 --> 00:04.046
It was me.

00:04.091 --> 00:06.354
I erased my own brother
from our minds.

00:06.397 --> 00:07.877
You lied.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.270
I think you know more about
the Jarrod story

00:09.313 --> 00:10.836
and for some reason
you don't want me on it.

00:10.880 --> 00:11.837
You asked me

00:11.881 --> 00:15.058
to be completely
myself with you.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.887
I can only operate at 100%.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.758
My brother now has
the power to incept.

00:19.802 --> 00:22.848
Make you do the things
he wants you to do
against your will.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.546
The Q-waves somehow

00:24.589 --> 00:26.113
forged a link between
Kelly's mind and Malefic's.

00:26.156 --> 00:28.028
She could see him,
even when he shapeshifted.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.681
We need
to get Kelly to safety.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.205
You should leave tonight.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.509
Take this.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.077
It's one of Lex's
transmatter portal watches.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.905
If you need it,
use it.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.060
You cannot run, human.

01:00.103 --> 01:02.453
I'm no human, brother.

01:08.764 --> 01:10.374
What do you know
of hurt?

01:10.418 --> 01:13.290
When the ones you love
turn their back on you,

01:13.334 --> 01:15.336
that's pain.
But you'll see,

01:15.379 --> 01:17.642
when you suffer
the way you made me suffer.

01:17.686 --> 01:20.384
You can't touch me
without hurting yourself.

01:20.428 --> 01:21.820
That's why he brought me.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.304
We came prepared.

01:27.348 --> 01:29.001
You can't incept
any of us now.

01:29.045 --> 01:30.568
Don't be so sure.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.354
Agent Blake?

01:38.750 --> 01:40.012
-J'onn, now.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.429
-Hey, you okay?

02:05.473 --> 02:08.345
-Yeah.
-We'll be at
Aunt Vi's in a few.

02:08.389 --> 02:11.522
You know, coming here
after dad died,

02:13.133 --> 02:14.134
that's what saved me.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.049
I don't know what
would've happened

02:17.093 --> 02:18.660
if Aunt Vi
hadn't taken us in.

02:18.703 --> 02:19.748
I know.

02:37.461 --> 02:40.160
My God,
what happened to this place?

02:43.859 --> 02:45.034
Is that a prison?

02:47.384 --> 02:48.559
That's definitely new.

02:54.086 --> 02:54.913
Step forward, please.

02:57.742 --> 02:59.396
Eyes straight ahead.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.224
The Martian protocol
is in place.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.270
At least Malefic
won't get in here.

03:03.313 --> 03:05.097
Hey, Brainy.

03:05.141 --> 03:06.534
What the hell happened?

03:06.577 --> 03:08.362
Malefic should have not
been able to phase through

03:08.405 --> 03:09.711
the Phantom Zone projector.

03:09.754 --> 03:12.888
And our psychic inhibitors,
he fried them.

03:12.931 --> 03:15.586
Malefic's brain is unlike
any other Green Martian.

03:15.630 --> 03:18.067
I tried to calibrate both
to his unique physiology, but--

03:18.110 --> 03:20.112
That was our one shot
at tricking him.

03:20.156 --> 03:22.593
He could be after
the real Kelly,
my Kelly right now.

03:22.637 --> 03:23.942
We are not
gonna let that happen.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.118
There's gotta be another way
we can track him.

03:26.162 --> 03:28.077
Something we're missing.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.080
What did he yell
at you, J'onn?
Synd'ar'k?

03:32.299 --> 03:33.735
Uh, I don't know.

03:33.778 --> 03:36.607
It's, um, it's a dialect
I've not heard before.

03:36.651 --> 03:38.740
We can't afford
any more missteps.

03:38.783 --> 03:41.090
I'm having the Verdex Blaster
brought up from the armory.

03:41.133 --> 03:44.006
-What?
-Alex.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.182
That Verdex Blaster
was designed by Hank Henshaw

03:46.226 --> 03:49.141
to kill Green Martians,
specifically me.

03:49.185 --> 03:50.186
It's a last resort.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.188
Hank Henshaw was wrong
about you,

03:52.232 --> 03:54.799
but Malefic is exactly
the kind of Martian

03:54.843 --> 03:56.671
that this blaster
was designed for.

03:56.714 --> 03:59.108
Hang on, wait, wait, wait.
Let's not rush into this.

03:59.151 --> 04:01.153
Because if we had had
the Verdex Blaster,

04:01.197 --> 04:05.245
Malefic could've incepted
one of us to use it on J'onn.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.551
Let's at least have
Brainy try to fix it first.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.033
Okay.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.297
Okay.

04:14.341 --> 04:17.995
Excellent. I shall adjust
the Phantom Zone
projector's wavelengths

04:18.040 --> 04:19.868
so Malefic cannot
phase through it

04:19.911 --> 04:22.174
while simultaneously
recalibrating the psychic
inhibitor frequencies

04:22.218 --> 04:24.307
all to distract myself
from my broken heart.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.309
- Uh, what?
- What?

04:26.353 --> 04:28.268
Nothing. Why?

04:28.311 --> 04:29.617
What did you hear?

04:29.660 --> 04:31.575
Maybe we should call in Lena
for backup.

04:35.884 --> 04:37.059
Nia, what's up?

04:37.102 --> 04:38.756
I was doing some background
on William,

04:38.800 --> 04:41.933
and guess whose marriage
to a successful lawyer
is a lie? His.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.979
You know that picture of
his wife he keeps on his desk?

04:44.022 --> 04:46.938
It's a stock photo
he got off the web.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.636
And that article
Andrea cleared him

04:48.679 --> 04:50.899
to write from London?
Well, I had a weird feeling
about it.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.553
So I astral projected
and I followed him,

04:52.596 --> 04:54.685
it was like something
out of a James Bond movie.

04:54.729 --> 04:57.340
He got passed this newspaper
from some guy,

04:57.384 --> 04:59.690
and now, all of a sudden, he's no longer going to London,

04:59.734 --> 05:00.996
he's going to Mexico City.

05:01.039 --> 05:03.041
-Who is this guy?
-Well, let's see,

05:03.085 --> 05:06.306
he's a liar who
is literally made of shadows,

05:06.349 --> 05:08.786
and now he's going south
to meet someone named

05:08.830 --> 05:10.179
Elena Torres.

05:11.572 --> 05:12.877
I think she might be
his next target.

05:12.921 --> 05:13.922
Good work.

05:15.663 --> 05:17.708
-It was Nia?
- Yes.

05:17.752 --> 05:20.450
Yes, she has another
lead on William.

05:20.494 --> 05:23.366
Another possible
assassination attempt.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.281
Well, if you think someone's
life is at stake,

05:25.325 --> 05:26.848
-then you should go.
-Are you sure?

05:26.891 --> 05:28.458
-With Kelly?
-I'm sure.

05:28.502 --> 05:29.590
Okay.

05:29.633 --> 05:32.506
Wait, before...
Before you go.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.552
Did Nia ask about me?

05:35.596 --> 05:37.380
-Oh, God.
-Not that I care.

05:37.424 --> 05:40.557
I mean, not that I don't care,
it's not a big deal.

05:40.601 --> 05:41.993
Uh-huh.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.604
I'll call Lena.

05:43.647 --> 05:45.214
Of course, Alex,
I'll be right over.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.566
I believe I've isolated
the problem, Ms. Luthor.

05:49.610 --> 05:52.003
Lex's journals helped us
build the inception tuner

05:52.047 --> 05:53.701
to implement thoughts
into the brain,

05:53.744 --> 05:56.921
but the specific Q-wave
frequency is incorrect.

05:56.965 --> 06:00.098
Unfortunately, that leaves us
with hundreds of thousands
of variables.

06:00.142 --> 06:02.971
I may have
an expedited solution, Hope.

06:03.014 --> 06:04.929
Alex has just asked me
to assist the DEO

06:04.973 --> 06:07.062
in apprehending
a rogue Green Martian.

06:07.105 --> 06:08.280
The brother of J'onn J'onzz?

06:08.324 --> 06:09.499
Yes.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.109
Apparently, he has
the ability to override

06:11.153 --> 06:12.894
another person's thoughts
with his own.

06:12.937 --> 06:14.417
Mind control.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.419
Using Q-waves.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.856
If we were able
to harness Malefic's abilities,

06:18.900 --> 06:20.945
we could use them
to determine what frequency
is needed

06:20.989 --> 06:22.643
to implant thoughts
into the brain.

06:22.686 --> 06:25.950
The study and testing
would require us
to detain the subject.

06:25.994 --> 06:28.649
I doubt Supergirl
or her friends would approve.

06:28.692 --> 06:29.519
No.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.608
I don't think they would.

06:43.925 --> 06:47.102
At least
Aunt Vi's house
is the way I remember it.

06:47.145 --> 06:48.451
- Malefic?
-Wait here.

06:54.849 --> 06:55.850
Hey.

07:04.511 --> 07:05.860
I saw some kids running
into the woods.

07:05.903 --> 07:07.035
Were they stealing stuff?

07:08.471 --> 07:10.255
I think they were
doing homework.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.063
Why would anyone
want to kill her?

08:19.107 --> 08:22.502
She was the lead accountant
for Obsidian Worldwide.

08:22.545 --> 08:23.720
You mean, our parent company?

08:23.764 --> 08:25.287
And William's.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.854
Also, I tracked
that license plate number
you sent me

08:26.897 --> 08:29.421
and got a hit back
courtesy of our friends
at the NCPD.

08:31.336 --> 08:33.077
Meet Sergio Ramos,

08:33.121 --> 08:35.645
known player
in Intergang, Mexico City.

08:35.688 --> 08:38.779
Are you saying that
William is involved
with organized crime?

08:38.822 --> 08:41.085
This is starting
to get a little
international assassin-y.

08:41.129 --> 08:44.306
We need proof.
We have to find out
what he had on her.

08:45.568 --> 08:46.787
What she had on him.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.182
I want to remind you again.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.184
This is liable to be
quite painful.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.795
Until we calibrate
the Phantom Zone projector

08:54.838 --> 08:56.579
to lock onto
a Martian energy signature,

08:56.623 --> 08:58.276
regardless of
the Martian's density,

08:58.320 --> 08:59.364
so they can't
phase through it.

08:59.408 --> 09:00.583
I'm ready when you are.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.498
Commencing phasing
at 25%.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.592
Sprock, sprock, sprock.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.638
I'm okay. I'm okay.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.248
What went wrong?

09:13.291 --> 09:14.902
It was too much,
too much, too much...

09:14.945 --> 09:16.991
I'm almost done
reinforcing the psychic
inhibitors,

09:17.034 --> 09:18.296
so I can help you,
if you want it.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.081
I heard the scream.
What happened?

09:20.124 --> 09:21.343
-How, how...
-Brainy?

09:21.386 --> 09:23.127
Yeah, I'm...
I'll figure it out, all right?

09:23.171 --> 09:25.129
I'll figure it all out.

09:25.173 --> 09:28.785
I'm sorry, J'onn, we need
all of our options
on the table.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.482
I'm prepping the blaster.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.575
Alex.

09:35.618 --> 09:36.967
Alex, please don't.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.969
I don't...

09:39.013 --> 09:41.276
I don't understand
why you are defending him.

09:41.319 --> 09:43.800
He betrayed you
and all of the Green Martians

09:43.844 --> 09:46.498
during the war.
They were slaughtered
because of him.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.631
I'm just really sorry
he's doing this.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.720
Well, you have nothing
to be sorry about.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.069
Okay? This isn't your fault.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.942
It's mine.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.683
It is killing me
that Kelly is in danger

09:56.726 --> 09:59.642
because of me and my job,
and I am terrified

09:59.686 --> 10:01.992
that he is going to use me
somehow to get to her,

10:02.036 --> 10:04.081
and I just keep praying
that she's safe.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.388
I would never let
anything happen to her.

10:06.431 --> 10:09.173
You can't. Promise that.

10:09.217 --> 10:11.828
I know that you are trying
to make me feel better, I do.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.003
-But I won't,

10:13.047 --> 10:15.179
not until that monster
is taken care of.

10:15.223 --> 10:17.399
You do what you need
to do to feel safe.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.229
But I'm not giving up
on Brainy.

10:23.405 --> 10:25.668
So much around here
has changed.

10:25.712 --> 10:28.410
Oh, at least one thing
has changed for the better.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.368
Nelson Stewart?

10:30.412 --> 10:32.414
Isn't that the reporter
you interned for?

10:32.457 --> 10:35.417
Nelson taught me
everything I know about
journalistic integrity.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.812
Publisher? Yeah,
way to go, Nelson.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.378
-That's what I'm talking about.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.561
That's it,
I'm calling the cops.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.389
-I'm gonna pay for it.
-Hey, get your hands
off of him.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.130
-He was stealing.
-Last time I checked,

10:53.174 --> 10:55.959
it wasn't stealing
when you're still in the store.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.700
And besides, I asked him
to get it for me.

10:58.396 --> 11:00.181
I'm paying for it.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.661
Now give him back
the ravioli.

11:08.755 --> 11:09.930
Thanks a lot, lady.

11:09.973 --> 11:10.931
I met you, right?
You're one of the kids

11:10.974 --> 11:12.236
from before
from the house.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.716
Uh, yeah, so?

11:13.760 --> 11:15.065
So, you have a name?

11:15.587 --> 11:16.719
Simon Kirby.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.852
It's nice to meet you, Simon.
I'm Kelly.

11:18.895 --> 11:21.071
-I'm James.
-I know who you are.

11:21.115 --> 11:25.249
I read the news,
CatCo. Guardian. Duh.

11:25.293 --> 11:26.729
Uh, here's your food back.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.646
-I'm gonna...
- Yeah.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.955
So, my sister's planning
a homemade dinner tonight.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.653
She's an awful cook.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.438
You know, you'd be
doing me a solid

11:40.482 --> 11:41.701
if you came by
and ate with us.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.398
I broke into your house,

11:43.441 --> 11:45.182
camped out
in your living room,

11:45.226 --> 11:47.924
and I can make it up to you
by coming over
and eating bad food?

11:47.968 --> 11:50.100
Yeah.
Misery loves company.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.102
So...

11:52.668 --> 11:53.495
What do you say?

12:18.955 --> 12:22.045
Sorry.
It was open.
Elena Torres?

12:23.133 --> 12:24.569
Don't take this personally.

12:33.578 --> 12:36.320
Hey, you really
could've hurt that lady.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.321
Supergirl?

12:39.846 --> 12:41.151
I wonder,

12:41.195 --> 12:42.718
do you need to breathe?

13:00.736 --> 13:01.693
Alex?

13:03.391 --> 13:04.522
Agent Sloan,

13:04.566 --> 13:05.872
Supergirl's bringing
a prisoner in,

13:05.915 --> 13:07.569
-prep a cell.
-Yes, ma'am.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.490
Malefic.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.058
You incepted someone
to bypass the Martian protocol.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.365
-Put your gun down.
-You first.

13:26.196 --> 13:28.329
That's better.

13:28.372 --> 13:31.811
Now my brother's friend
is his enemy.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.781
I tried grilling her
about William,

13:45.825 --> 13:47.304
but she's not talking.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.828
Any news on Malefic?

13:48.871 --> 13:49.916
Nothing yet.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.223
You sure you're okay?

13:53.267 --> 13:54.964
I am, yeah, thanks.

13:58.576 --> 14:01.449
Now it's time you learned
my brother's crimes.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.895
Pizza will be ready
in a few.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.332
That was so cool,
what you did for me

14:15.376 --> 14:16.377
at the store.

14:16.420 --> 14:17.813
Anyone would've done the same.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.251
No, nobody would've done it.

14:21.295 --> 14:23.601
Nobody risks their neck
for anybody around here.

14:24.951 --> 14:28.041
But you did.
It was badass and selfless.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.000
Is it supposed to do that?

14:34.874 --> 14:36.223
-You okay?

14:36.266 --> 14:37.180
What happened?

14:37.224 --> 14:38.834
Nothing, I just... Headache.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.576
Um, I'm gonna get some air,
will you watch the pizza?

14:41.619 --> 14:42.620
Yeah, of course.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.536
Okay.

14:45.580 --> 14:46.624
Oh, it's not that bad.

14:46.668 --> 14:47.799
I like it burned.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.932
Good thing.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.978
So how long you been
living in my aunt's house?

14:52.021 --> 14:53.283
Couple of months.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.329
Sometimes we crash
with friends,

14:55.372 --> 14:56.939
sometimes we just camp out
in the woods.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.462
Where are your parents?

14:58.506 --> 15:00.551
Haven't seen my dad
since I was...

15:01.509 --> 15:03.119
five?

15:03.163 --> 15:04.468
My mom got busted
last winter

15:04.512 --> 15:06.470
stealing a space heater
from the hardware store.

15:06.514 --> 15:09.865
The judge wouldn't even
give her a chance to explain.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.086
They gave her 10 years
for stealing a 30 buck heater.

15:13.129 --> 15:16.132
Since when does petty theft
get you that kind of time?

15:16.176 --> 15:18.961
It's a racket.
The cops, judges, lawyers,

15:19.005 --> 15:20.615
everyone's in on it.

15:20.658 --> 15:21.964
They keep the prison full,

15:22.008 --> 15:23.705
the prison keeps
their pockets lined.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.402
How's nobody
stood up against them?

15:25.446 --> 15:26.664
Called these guys out?

15:26.708 --> 15:28.275
Like who?

15:28.318 --> 15:30.973
Nobody's gonna speak up
and risk themselves.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.670
Anyways, you can't beat
the system,

15:32.714 --> 15:33.758
so what's the point?

15:33.802 --> 15:35.238
There is a point, Simon.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.501
You have to stand up
and fight against injustice.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.242
Everyone's just out
for their own skin.

15:40.287 --> 15:41.244
It's the way it is.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.203
Not on my watch.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.991
Sprock.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.298
I seem to have made the beam
more dense instead of less.

15:51.341 --> 15:52.560
Let's go again.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.431
Just give me
a minute.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.607
Okay, J'onn, you can't
keep putting yourself
through this punishment.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.000
- I'm fine.
-No.

15:58.044 --> 15:59.654
You're not,
you can barely stand.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.047
And we need you
at full strength

16:01.090 --> 16:02.918
-for when we find your brother.
-I told you.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.702
I will help Brainy,

16:04.746 --> 16:06.313
so Alex doesn't have
to use the blaster.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.663
Go clear your head.

16:16.584 --> 16:17.933
Look, Brainy, I know
you haven't asked for help,

16:17.977 --> 16:20.066
-but you're getting it anyway.
-No.

16:20.109 --> 16:23.243
I need my mind consumed
with this problem,
so I don't think of Nia.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.984
What happened
to your little boxes?

16:27.725 --> 16:31.077
Little boxes
prevented me from
having a real relationship.

16:32.295 --> 16:34.254
Unfortunately,
my unboxed self

16:34.297 --> 16:36.604
does not make a particularly
good boyfriend.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.562
So I have been analyzing
myself for days,

16:38.606 --> 16:42.262
searching for a way
to modulate myself
for the woman I love.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.397
Well, I'm not gonna give you
relationship advice.

16:47.441 --> 16:50.705
But as a scientist,
you seem to be stuck

16:50.748 --> 16:52.576
in an infinite loop,
and unless you can escape,

16:52.620 --> 16:53.969
you're headed for a crash.

16:55.449 --> 16:58.756
-That would be cataclysmic.
-So change a variable.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.758
What's the one thing
you haven't tried yet?

17:02.412 --> 17:03.848
Asking for help?

17:08.853 --> 17:11.030
Will you he...

17:15.512 --> 17:18.602
Will you help...

17:19.994 --> 17:21.083
me?

17:21.127 --> 17:22.040
Yes.

17:24.260 --> 17:28.134
And I think a small dose
of that will go a long way
with Nia.

17:28.176 --> 17:32.138
Okay, could you find me
a polarity tuner,
and we can get to work?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.042
Hey.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.392
Somebody get me
a photographer,

18:09.436 --> 18:10.785
we got a celebrity
sighting here.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.265
Nelson, what's up, brother,
how you doing?

18:12.308 --> 18:14.136
-Jimmy Olsen.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.442
What the hell
are you doing here?

18:15.485 --> 18:16.660
I hope you're not
looking for a job,

18:16.704 --> 18:17.792
we can't afford you.

18:17.835 --> 18:20.011
No, I've actually come
with a story.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.839
So I met this local kid
who says his mom is

18:21.883 --> 18:24.320
serving 10 years
for petty theft?

18:24.364 --> 18:26.931
So I did some digging,
and that prison in
your backyard

18:26.975 --> 18:29.978
seems to have a lot of
people serving long sentences
for small crimes.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.980
Yeah, people
have bad luck, I guess.

18:32.023 --> 18:33.112
Bad luck?

18:34.243 --> 18:35.810
It's prison corruption,
wouldn't you say?

18:37.203 --> 18:39.944
It's, um,
it's complicated.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.598
Look, I wish
I could help you, but--

18:41.642 --> 18:43.687
You can help me, Nelson,
that's why I'm here.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.428
Journalism's about
fighting for the little guy,

18:45.472 --> 18:47.038
you taught me that.

18:47.082 --> 18:48.344
It's your job to
point out corruption,

18:48.388 --> 18:49.824
so what the hell's
going on here?

18:51.130 --> 18:53.306
Things have changed
for some people.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.179
Idealism doesn't
feed a family.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.529
And this whole power
of the press thing,

18:59.573 --> 19:02.880
it might work if you've got
the backing of
a media conglomerate

19:02.924 --> 19:04.839
and a certain girl
with a cape.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.319
But around here,
it doesn't mean anything.

19:06.362 --> 19:10.149
Standing up for what's right
always means something.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.715
Nelson.

19:11.759 --> 19:14.457
That prison is stomping
on the neck of
this entire town.

19:14.501 --> 19:18.244
It's also the only thing
that's keeping this town alive.

19:18.287 --> 19:22.161
Look, I'd love to see these
bastards get what they deserve.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.901
But if I call them out,

19:23.945 --> 19:26.034
my advertisers,
they pull their money,

19:26.077 --> 19:27.383
not only am I out of a job

19:27.427 --> 19:29.603
but so are the
30 other people I employ.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.606
Go back to National City.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.784
I like to think of you there.

19:36.827 --> 19:40.135
You know,
I'm just glad somebody
made it out of this town.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.746
And I'm glad it was you.

19:47.621 --> 19:50.798
Listen to this. So my contact
at the Mexico City Herald

19:50.841 --> 19:52.713
said the morgue
had a discrepancy.

19:52.756 --> 19:54.976
Elena's body was burned
beyond recognition,

19:55.019 --> 19:58.197
but they were able
to use an incisor
to confirm ID and...

19:59.241 --> 20:00.460
it wasn't a match.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.636
Apparently, the body
they pulled from the car

20:02.679 --> 20:05.247
had been dead for two weeks
and died of natural causes.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.640
So they faked Elena's death?

20:08.772 --> 20:11.079
Well, that sheds new light
on my news.

20:11.122 --> 20:14.648
I ran the numbers
you found at Elena's apartment
by my accountant friend,

20:14.691 --> 20:18.434
and it turns out it's linked
to an offshore bank account.

20:18.478 --> 20:19.957
Someone's been funneling
money into it

20:20.001 --> 20:21.959
for the past year,
and there are two names

20:22.003 --> 20:24.223
listed on the ledger,
one is Elena's

20:24.266 --> 20:25.441
and the other is anonymous.

20:25.485 --> 20:26.355
Huh.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.444
You think William?

20:28.488 --> 20:29.532
Maybe.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.883
Embezzlement,
is that what this is?

20:32.927 --> 20:35.277
My friend says there's
an address listed
to the account,

20:35.321 --> 20:36.844
but it's encrypted.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.672
Let's call Brainy,
see if he can crack it.

20:38.715 --> 20:41.805
Or I could
ask my friend to do it.

20:41.849 --> 20:44.286
Are things still weird
between you guys?

20:44.330 --> 20:46.636
He did seem a little off
this morning.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.117
I was afraid
this would happen.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.815
I thought that if I was just
honest with Brainy,

20:51.859 --> 20:53.208
it would help solve
our problems,

20:53.252 --> 20:55.254
but it's only
made things worse.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.430
I know it's something that
we could work through together,

20:57.473 --> 20:59.649
but he thinks that
it's his problem to solve,

20:59.693 --> 21:01.303
and now he won't
even talk to me.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.044
Well, you know how Brainy is,

21:03.087 --> 21:06.134
sometimes human emotions
just throw him for a loop.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.832
I think he just needs time,

21:08.876 --> 21:11.661
and to realize
you're not going anywhere.

21:11.705 --> 21:14.490
Okay.
So you get this back

21:14.534 --> 21:16.666
to your friend,
see if she can unencrypt it.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.581
I'm gonna get to the DEO.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.322
Talk to Alex and J'onn,
see if there's any news

21:20.366 --> 21:21.323
on the Malefic front.

21:21.367 --> 21:22.759
Copy that, boss.

21:22.803 --> 21:24.935
We are so close
to cracking this,
I can feel it.

21:35.294 --> 21:39.080
On a clear day, you can see
the moons of Mars from here.

21:39.123 --> 21:40.777
Today's not a clear day.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.518
I found out
what you've done, J'onn.

21:42.562 --> 21:43.954
You lied to all of us.

21:43.998 --> 21:45.608
You put us in jeopardy,

21:45.652 --> 21:47.915
so that you could
protect yourself.

21:47.958 --> 21:49.525
Keep your secret safe.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.442
That you mind-wiped
the existence

21:53.486 --> 21:55.923
-of your own brother--
-Alex, I wanted to tell you,

21:55.966 --> 21:58.055
but I was so ashamed.

21:58.099 --> 22:03.365
I confided in you
how this was tearing me apart.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.715
How I thought that
I was the one

22:05.759 --> 22:09.023
putting Kelly in danger,
and you just stood there,

22:09.066 --> 22:11.504
knowing that
it wasn't my fault.

22:12.287 --> 22:13.680
That it was yours.

22:13.723 --> 22:17.466
You had me convinced
that Malefic was the monster,

22:17.510 --> 22:21.731
but he wasn't just some
bad guy coming after people.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.865
He was some bad guy
that you created

22:24.908 --> 22:27.520
coming after your family,
and again

22:27.563 --> 22:29.739
you just stood there,

22:29.783 --> 22:33.308
and you let us suffer
the consequences.

22:38.313 --> 22:39.619
-I know.
-You may say

22:39.662 --> 22:43.231
that you erased Malefic
to protect your family,

22:43.797 --> 22:45.712
to protect Myr'nn.

22:47.104 --> 22:49.759
Or you did it
because it was easier

22:49.803 --> 22:51.326
-than helping him.
-No.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.763
No, no.

22:53.807 --> 22:56.418
Malefic isn't
the monster here, J'onn.

22:59.290 --> 23:00.944
-You are.

23:03.599 --> 23:04.687
Alex.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.821
Alex.

23:13.087 --> 23:14.567
Yeah, okay, thanks.

23:15.568 --> 23:17.004
-Hey, so...

23:17.047 --> 23:18.309
The newspaper
might've been a bust,

23:18.353 --> 23:21.443
but good news, the best lawyer
in National City

23:21.487 --> 23:22.966
has decided
to take your mom's case.

23:23.010 --> 23:24.011
For real?

23:24.054 --> 23:25.795
Yeah, I wouldn't kid
about that.

23:25.839 --> 23:28.015
And don't worry
about her fee.

23:28.058 --> 23:29.451
-I'll cover it.
- Wow.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.758
When do we meet her?

23:31.801 --> 23:33.673
I could probably set up
a meeting with you guys
next week.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.109
You mean, you won't be there?

23:35.152 --> 23:36.763
Oh, no, no, I...

23:36.806 --> 23:39.505
This was a visit, Simon,
I can't stay here.

23:42.159 --> 23:43.291
Right.

23:44.727 --> 23:47.600
Of course,
why would you?

23:47.643 --> 23:49.123
This town is a hellhole.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.907
Hey, no, no,
it's not like that.

23:50.951 --> 23:52.213
It's cool.

23:52.256 --> 23:53.823
I get it.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.651
It's not your problem.

23:55.695 --> 23:58.654
Thanks for the help
and the food.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.396
-See you around.
- Hey.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.137
Simon.

24:12.581 --> 24:13.713
J'onn?

24:14.540 --> 24:16.150
What is it?

24:17.194 --> 24:18.544
Is it something
about Malefic?

24:19.632 --> 24:21.111
Synd'ar'k.

24:24.680 --> 24:28.379
A synd'ar'kis a sinner,
that's what Malefic
yelled at me.

24:28.423 --> 24:31.034
I asked Nia to use
her dream power

24:31.078 --> 24:33.602
to help me find
the truth about my brother,

24:33.646 --> 24:35.735
about the mind wipe.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.432
That's when we discovered...

24:43.264 --> 24:45.484
My brother wasn't born evil.

24:47.268 --> 24:48.356
He had a problem.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.401
And we...

24:51.098 --> 24:53.056
ostracized him.

24:53.100 --> 24:56.277
I wiped Malefic's existence
from our minds.

24:56.756 --> 24:57.757
It was me.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.457
I did this.

25:06.026 --> 25:07.636
I failed my people
more than once.

25:07.680 --> 25:08.855
I'm failing you.

25:08.898 --> 25:11.858
No, no, you've saved us
countless times.

25:11.901 --> 25:13.642
I would've been dead
last year,

25:13.686 --> 25:16.079
when the Earth was seeded
with Kryptonite,
if it weren't for you.

25:16.471 --> 25:17.341
Still...

25:18.908 --> 25:20.475
Wiping him
from our mind?

25:22.956 --> 25:24.566
It's like I murdered
my own brother.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.263
But you remember now.

25:29.005 --> 25:30.703
You risked your own life

25:30.746 --> 25:33.575
to find those memories,
and now you can find him

25:33.619 --> 25:34.881
and make different choices.

25:40.451 --> 25:43.672
It was so selfish of me to...

25:43.716 --> 25:45.979
burden Nia
with my secret,

25:46.022 --> 25:48.547
and keep this
from you and Alex.

25:51.811 --> 25:54.117
But I'm glad Nia told her.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.293
She deserves to know
the truth, and so do you.

25:56.337 --> 25:58.252
It couldn't have been Nia,
she's been with me.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.039
That was Malefic.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.869
He incepted Alex.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.221
I can't find Alex anywhere.

26:11.265 --> 26:14.442
She turned off
her phone and her comms.

26:14.485 --> 26:17.314
Where are we with
the Phantom Zone projector
and psychic inhibitors?

26:17.358 --> 26:18.620
Reconfigured and recalibrated.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.970
Supergirl, the Verdex Blaster
is missing

26:21.014 --> 26:23.320
and the armory's cleared out
of anti-Martian artillery.

26:23.364 --> 26:25.366
-It's all gone.
-We have to find Alex now.

26:26.410 --> 26:27.847
There is a way.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.631
I could try
and find her psychically.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.764
Malefic's mind is poisonous
to all Green Martians.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.635
Melding with Alex's
incepted mind

26:33.679 --> 26:35.332
would allow Malefic
into yours.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.334
It could hurt you.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.032
All that matters
is finding Alex.

26:44.341 --> 26:45.473
Alex.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.214
Open your mind for me.

26:47.257 --> 26:49.956
We are looking for you.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.523
We need you to come home.

26:52.567 --> 26:55.701
Please, Alex, answer me.

27:07.582 --> 27:08.888
You did what
you could for him, James.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.541
It wasn't enough.

27:10.585 --> 27:13.588
I mean, when Simon says

27:13.632 --> 27:16.417
it's not my problem,
 maybe it should be.

27:17.679 --> 27:18.898
I mean,
this kid's got nobody.

27:22.510 --> 27:23.729
Hey, you okay?

27:27.254 --> 27:29.560
I'm having...

27:29.604 --> 27:30.649
visions.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.389
I thought they were
in my head,

27:32.433 --> 27:34.261
but whatever happened
at Obsidian,

27:34.304 --> 27:36.480
it didn't just allow me
to see Malefic.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.570
I think I'm connected
to him.

27:39.614 --> 27:42.225
I think I can see
what he sees.

27:42.269 --> 27:45.751
And he has Alex. We need to
go back to National City now.

27:45.794 --> 27:47.187
We're not going back
to National City.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.189
We came here
to get you away from Malefic.

27:49.232 --> 27:51.365
James, when you put on
that Guardian suit,

27:51.408 --> 27:53.019
do you think first?

27:53.062 --> 27:56.413
Or do you see someone
in trouble and act?

27:56.457 --> 27:58.154
-That's different.
-The hell it is.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.765
We're going back now.

28:03.116 --> 28:05.466
Damn it, Malefic,
where is she?

28:11.298 --> 28:12.908
J'onn.

28:12.952 --> 28:15.258
Meet me
at the planetarium.

28:16.564 --> 28:17.957
Come alone.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.050
Welcome to Mars,

28:24.093 --> 28:27.053
home to one of the greatest civilizations.

28:27.096 --> 28:30.839
Wiped out by
the Great Martian civil war.

28:30.883 --> 28:33.842
One Green Martian now
lives on Earth among us.

28:34.538 --> 28:36.715
The Martian Manhunter.

28:36.758 --> 28:41.763
A coward who left his family
to face an agonizing death
and worse.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.809
And he's come here
to pay for it.

28:47.900 --> 28:50.293
Alex, please.

28:50.337 --> 28:52.252
Alex.

28:52.295 --> 28:53.993
I know my brother's
making you do this.

28:54.036 --> 28:56.212
And if you can hear me,
so can he.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.349
I never should have
banished you.

29:03.132 --> 29:05.221
I know that now.

29:05.265 --> 29:07.006
I've lived on Earth
for over 300 years.

29:08.616 --> 29:11.837
But I never really found
true peace.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.622
And I believe it's because
of what I did to you, Malefic.

29:17.581 --> 29:20.236
You didn't betray us.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.847
By aligning with
the White Martians,

29:21.890 --> 29:23.457
we betrayed you.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.893
We tried to fix you.

29:24.937 --> 29:26.155
Change you.

29:26.199 --> 29:28.375
When all along,
we should've accepted you.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.596
I accept you now, brother.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.076
-No!
-Yes.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.078
You forced me
to look inside myself

29:37.471 --> 29:39.516
and discover memories
I had erased.

29:42.258 --> 29:44.086
You did it
to try and punish me.

29:46.785 --> 29:47.786
But...

29:49.962 --> 29:53.182
Don't you see you've given us
a second chance?

29:54.227 --> 29:56.403
It's not too late
for us, brother.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.537
It's not...

30:00.581 --> 30:01.712
too...

30:04.498 --> 30:05.847
-late.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.025
-Oh, my God.

30:10.678 --> 30:12.071
What have I done?

30:15.291 --> 30:16.597
No!

30:19.774 --> 30:23.386
On Mars, you had nothing
but cruelty for me.

30:23.430 --> 30:25.606
Where did this love
and forgiveness come from?

30:25.649 --> 30:26.694
From my family.

30:26.737 --> 30:28.565
Family's supposed
to destroy you.

30:28.609 --> 30:30.567
He was supposed
to come alone too.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.615
This ends now, Malefic.

30:34.658 --> 30:36.312
Tell that to my friends.

30:37.748 --> 30:38.880
They've been incepted.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.186
The shield matrix, J'onn.

30:48.020 --> 30:50.413
Yeah, this dome won't last
with all the firepower.

30:52.546 --> 30:53.808
What is that?

30:57.464 --> 30:59.379
We are not going
to lose you again.

31:02.034 --> 31:03.470
The roof.

31:03.513 --> 31:06.081
If it collapses, then everyone
in here is gonna die.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.649
Go. Kara, go.

31:17.179 --> 31:18.964
J'onn, you gotta
get me out of this thing.

31:21.053 --> 31:22.445
Kelly, you shouldn't
be here.

31:22.489 --> 31:23.925
This is exactly
where I should be here.

31:23.969 --> 31:25.448
-What the hell is that thing?
-Oh, my God.

31:25.492 --> 31:27.581
A bomb. A hybrid of Tamaranean
and Pharoid technology.

31:27.624 --> 31:29.452
It's synched
to Alex's molecular structure.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.238
Supergirl,
can you hear me?

31:32.281 --> 31:33.326
Yeah.

31:33.369 --> 31:35.632
When the dome fails,
you and Guardian

31:35.676 --> 31:37.243
gather all of
the stolen weapons.

31:37.286 --> 31:40.333
Kelly, you're the only one
who can see him,
so find Malefic.

31:53.607 --> 31:54.956
-J'onn.
-Do you trust me?

31:55.000 --> 31:55.826
Yes.

31:58.655 --> 32:00.135
Supergirl, now.

32:05.053 --> 32:06.707
It's Malefic
in the blue jacket.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.899
So Malefic's
back in the Phantom Zone?

32:26.901 --> 32:29.469
I'm sorry that
you couldn't save him.

32:29.512 --> 32:32.124
J'onn, I know that that's
what you wanted to do.

32:32.167 --> 32:34.996
But I heard everything
that you said to him.

32:36.606 --> 32:38.739
I just wish
he could've taken it in.

32:40.567 --> 32:43.091
But maybe now
that I remember,

32:43.135 --> 32:45.528
I have a chance to make
things right at some point.

32:48.227 --> 32:51.317
How could you ever think
that I would say those things

32:51.360 --> 32:53.362
or think those things
about you?

32:53.406 --> 32:57.236
I guess because I thought
those things about myself.

32:57.279 --> 32:59.890
Well, I remember you
telling me once that

32:59.934 --> 33:02.719
true character reveals itself
in times of hardship.

33:03.677 --> 33:05.244
And I know who you really are.

33:15.341 --> 33:17.734
We couldn't have
done it without you.

33:17.778 --> 33:19.736
Please, I barely
did anything.

33:19.780 --> 33:22.435
What? You fixed
the inhibitors
and the projector.

33:22.478 --> 33:24.263
It did feel good.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.047
You and me working
together as a team.

33:26.091 --> 33:28.571
-Now that I know
who you actually are.

33:28.615 --> 33:33.054
Well, get used to it,
because you are now
officially a Superfriend.

33:33.098 --> 33:36.144
We have T-shirts
and a handshake.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.841
-I'll teach it to you.
It's not a big deal.

33:37.885 --> 33:39.452
It's a whole thing.

33:39.495 --> 33:41.976
We're going out to get drinks
tonight, do you wanna come?

33:42.020 --> 33:44.500
Oh, I would love to,
but I have been here all day,

33:44.544 --> 33:45.849
so I really should
get back to L-Corp.

33:45.893 --> 33:49.244
Of course. No rest
for the world-saving genius.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.475
Since Malefic is gone,

34:02.518 --> 34:06.522
how about less fighting
on the frontlines
and more...

34:06.566 --> 34:08.437
cuddles and Netflix?

34:08.481 --> 34:09.960
Okay, yeah, I'm in.

34:10.004 --> 34:14.094
Please, take this as a token
of my deepest apologies.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.750
Brainy, this is perfect.

34:16.793 --> 34:22.929
I do not know when or how
I will find a way to be myself,

34:22.973 --> 34:26.237
and yet not succumb
to my more obsessive qualities.

34:26.281 --> 34:28.109
Perhaps we could
work on it together?

34:28.936 --> 34:30.242
I'm not going anywhere.

34:32.635 --> 34:33.462
Dibs.

34:33.505 --> 34:34.550
Did you just say "dibs"?

34:34.594 --> 34:36.117
- I did.
- Well done.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.902
Okay, here is
to always being together.

34:38.946 --> 34:40.817
Cheers.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.864
About that.

34:43.907 --> 34:46.822
You guys all know that
I've been doing
a lot of soul searching

34:46.867 --> 34:48.303
since I left CatCo.

34:48.347 --> 34:49.913
Trying to figure out
what's next.

34:49.956 --> 34:52.829
I knew I wanted to give back,
and I wanted to help people.

34:54.701 --> 34:57.573
But I was driving myself
crazy trying to figure out

34:57.617 --> 35:00.794
where to put those efforts.

35:03.188 --> 35:06.582
And then my extremely
wise sister...

35:08.018 --> 35:10.195
...gave me some
damn good advice.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.545
She said, "Stop trying
so hard to figure things out,

35:13.807 --> 35:15.374
and just be still

35:16.853 --> 35:17.898
and listen."

35:17.941 --> 35:19.204
And finally I heard it.

35:19.247 --> 35:22.032
Only it wasn't a voice
from inside of me,

35:22.076 --> 35:23.164
it was this kid's voice,

35:23.208 --> 35:25.645
this kid that we met
in Calvintown.

35:25.688 --> 35:28.822
Sadly, it's become
this cesspool
for crime and corruption.

35:29.431 --> 35:30.911
And he told me that

35:31.912 --> 35:33.566
no one's there
willing to help.

35:33.609 --> 35:37.222
There's nobody willing
to stand up and
do the right thing.

35:37.265 --> 35:40.181
There's nobody willing
to put their neck on the line.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.183
And just like that,

35:42.227 --> 35:44.098
that's what I knew
I had to do.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.795
Look, I've been fighting
the good fight

35:45.839 --> 35:49.103
from a fancy corner office
for years.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.671
And in the streets
of National City as Guardian.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.414
But I started off
as a guy with a camera.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.940
A camera our dad gave me.

36:04.205 --> 36:05.424
Among the people.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.776
And that is
where I need to be.

36:10.559 --> 36:11.778
For now,

36:12.822 --> 36:14.607
I'm going back to Calvintown.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.566
-I'm going home.

36:17.610 --> 36:19.742
And I'm gonna show that town
that there is somebody

36:19.786 --> 36:21.179
who is willing
to fight for them.

36:24.051 --> 36:26.009
I'm gonna buy
the Calvintown Gazette.

36:26.053 --> 36:27.185
Wow.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.405
Look, Andrea Rojas
may be able to stop me

36:30.449 --> 36:31.711
from writing
for a newspaper,

36:31.754 --> 36:33.495
but she can't stop me
from publishing one.

36:33.539 --> 36:35.932
That's amazing.

36:35.976 --> 36:38.108
And what are
we gonna do without you?

36:38.152 --> 36:40.633
One of the main reasons
I moved to National City

36:40.676 --> 36:43.070
was because Clark wanted me
to keep an eye on you.

36:45.072 --> 36:46.682
But you're the one
that kept an eye on me.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.555
You never needed me.

36:50.730 --> 36:53.254
Not then,
and certainly not now.

36:54.473 --> 36:56.910
Yeah, but we are going
to miss you.

36:57.650 --> 36:58.781
So much.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.831
My feelings are springing out,

37:04.874 --> 37:07.268
and I can't seem to find
a little box to contain them.

37:07.312 --> 37:08.617
Okay, try this box.

37:11.098 --> 37:12.012
To James.

37:12.795 --> 37:16.059
To James.

37:16.103 --> 37:17.191
No.

37:17.800 --> 37:18.801
To you guys.

37:24.024 --> 37:25.895
I can't believe James
is really gone.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.549
I guess part of me
always thought he'd come back.

37:27.593 --> 37:29.290
I know.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.814
But I'm happy for him.
He deserves this.

37:31.858 --> 37:32.902
Yeah.

37:36.123 --> 37:37.298
Kara?

37:39.953 --> 37:41.781
What is it?

37:41.824 --> 37:44.523
My friend unencrypted
the address associated
with Elena's account.

37:45.045 --> 37:46.133
It's here.

37:46.829 --> 37:48.266
In National City.

38:01.496 --> 38:02.323
What?

38:13.813 --> 38:15.031
How the hell
did you get in here?

38:16.990 --> 38:19.340
-What is this?
-Kara, walk out of here,

38:19.384 --> 38:20.472
forget what you just saw.

38:20.515 --> 38:21.603
-It's too dangerous.
-What are you?

38:21.647 --> 38:23.823
-An undercover cop?
-I'm a journalist,

38:23.866 --> 38:25.085
like you.

38:25.128 --> 38:26.695
I work for
The Timesin London,

38:26.739 --> 38:30.177
I'm here undercover
to investigate Andrea Rojas.

38:30.220 --> 38:31.918
I'm sorry,
but you've got to leave.

38:31.961 --> 38:33.223
Before you get
mixed up in this.

38:33.267 --> 38:36.836
Be real with me this once,
and maybe I will.

38:36.879 --> 38:39.055
'Cause I already know about
your offshore bank account,

38:39.099 --> 38:40.361
the one you share
with Elena Torres.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.363
I know you were
in Mexico City yesterday,

38:42.407 --> 38:43.886
helping her fake
her own death.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.975
I know that you pretend
to have a wife, but you don't.

38:46.019 --> 38:49.239
I know about Dr. Jarrod,
Dr. Stern,

38:49.283 --> 38:51.546
so why don't you stop
trying to cover your tracks

38:51.590 --> 38:52.982
and just try
telling the truth?

38:55.724 --> 38:57.596
Elena thought
they were onto her,

38:57.639 --> 38:59.380
that they knew she was
talking to someone,

38:59.424 --> 39:00.816
I needed to keep her safe.

39:00.860 --> 39:03.384
And what about your
Intergang friend Sergio Ramos?

39:03.428 --> 39:05.647
Sergio is Interpol,
undercover.

39:05.691 --> 39:07.214
He helped me get her out.

39:07.257 --> 39:10.260
If the Rojases are dirty,
why aren't you saying anything?

39:10.304 --> 39:12.132
Because I haven't found
the proof yet.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.177
Two years' worth of reporting

39:14.221 --> 39:17.050
that suggests
a criminal conspiracy
bigger than Al Capone,

39:17.093 --> 39:19.139
but nothing that connects
the Rojases directly.

39:19.182 --> 39:22.185
It's why I took the job
at CatCo, to get close
to Andrea.

39:22.229 --> 39:24.797
Doing everything I can to get
into the Rojas inner circle.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.929
You have been a toxic jerk
since you got here.

39:26.973 --> 39:28.496
How do I know
you're not just spinning this

39:28.540 --> 39:30.368
to get me off the scent
of what you're actually up to?

39:32.370 --> 39:36.112
Because that jerk
was a lie.

39:36.156 --> 39:38.506
An identity I put on
to keep everyone at CatCo

39:38.550 --> 39:39.681
from wanting to
get
to know me.

39:39.725 --> 39:41.770
-Well, it worked.
-And it killed me.

39:41.814 --> 39:43.772
Every time I was rude to you,

39:43.816 --> 39:46.645
every time I lied about what
I've really been up to.

39:47.776 --> 39:49.430
Now that you know,

39:49.474 --> 39:51.432
at least I can
be honest with you.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.695
At least maybe
you can forgive me.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.134
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

39:58.178 --> 39:59.745
I don't blame you.

39:59.788 --> 40:02.225
I'd hate me too.

40:02.269 --> 40:03.792
Giving you
the cold shoulder.

40:03.836 --> 40:07.187
Being hypercompetitive
in order to get closer
to Andrea.

40:07.230 --> 40:09.232
Criticizing your writing,

40:09.276 --> 40:11.931
instead of telling you
what I really thought.

40:11.974 --> 40:15.413
You mean my work's
not really "sentimental tripe"?

40:17.458 --> 40:20.722
Your articles are honest
and smart.

40:21.897 --> 40:23.333
I could never write
the way you write.

40:23.377 --> 40:24.465
You have two Pulitzers.

40:24.509 --> 40:26.249
It's not from
the writing.

40:26.293 --> 40:28.121
It's from the story.

40:28.164 --> 40:31.951
I have craft,
you have art.

40:33.213 --> 40:36.869
Now promise me
you'll let this go.

40:36.912 --> 40:38.914
I'd never forgive myself
if you got wrapped up in this.

40:39.872 --> 40:42.178
You don't have
to worry about me.

40:42.222 --> 40:44.485
I can take care of myself.

40:44.529 --> 40:48.489
I don't doubt that
you can take care of everything
you set your mind to.

40:53.102 --> 40:54.539
Wow.

40:54.582 --> 40:56.366
Can't believe
you came back.

40:56.410 --> 40:57.759
That you bought the paper.

40:59.631 --> 41:00.980
What can I say?

41:01.023 --> 41:03.504
I like a challenge.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.854
Who knows, maybe you and I
could fix this town together.

41:08.291 --> 41:09.684
By the way,

41:09.728 --> 41:11.164
you know how
to work a camera?

41:12.121 --> 41:13.558
Like, on my phone?

41:13.601 --> 41:16.038
No,
not like on your phone.

41:17.170 --> 41:18.301
Like a real one.

41:21.174 --> 41:22.392
My dad gave me
this camera.

41:25.265 --> 41:26.309
And now it's yours.

41:29.095 --> 41:30.183
Thanks, Chief.

41:30.226 --> 41:31.314
Don't call me chief.

41:33.316 --> 41:34.404
It's Jimmy.

41:38.104 --> 41:39.366
Where am I?

41:40.323 --> 41:42.151
This is not the Phantom Zone.

41:42.195 --> 41:44.589
By now you've realized
you can't phase through
these walls.

41:45.938 --> 41:47.679
But don't think of this
as a prison.

41:47.722 --> 41:48.854
I'm not your enemy.

41:50.420 --> 41:52.074
In fact, I think
we can help each other.
