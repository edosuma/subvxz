00:03.640 --> 00:04.920
Previously...

00:06.280 --> 00:08.079
on Love Island.

00:08.080 --> 00:11.040
A new girl meant fresh
opportunities.

00:12.560 --> 00:13.959
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>
<font color="cyan">Hello.</font>

00:13.960 --> 00:16.519
<font color="cyan">Cheers, nice to meet you.</font>
<font color="yellow">Lovely to meet you also.</font>

00:16.520 --> 00:18.439
There was heartache.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.119
<font color="yellow">I was finally starting to feel</font>
<font color="yellow">something and you know me,</font>

00:21.120 --> 00:24.279
<font color="yellow">like I said before... Sorry!</font>

00:24.280 --> 00:26.239
And happiness.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.440
<font color="cyan">So I was wondering...</font>

00:29.480 --> 00:31.239
<font color="cyan">if you wanted to be my boyfriend.</font>

00:31.240 --> 00:32.640
<c.color008000>Yeah, of course I do.</font>

00:39.520 --> 00:41.200
Tonight...

00:43.400 --> 00:45.960
the new girl...

00:48.320 --> 00:50.480
..is in turmoil.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.160
<font color="yellow">I am starting to get</font>
<font color="yellow">really nervous now.</font>

00:55.160 --> 00:57.199
<font color="yellow">It is making my decision really,</font>
<font color="yellow">really hard</font>

00:57.200 --> 00:58.839
<font color="yellow">because they are all so lovely.</font>

00:58.840 --> 01:02.439
<font color="yellow">Alex, Kieren, and Idris.</font>

01:02.440 --> 01:04.519
<font color="yellow">I don't want to send anybody home.</font>

# JOSS STONE: Super Duper Love

01:26.160 --> 01:28.399
Yeah, happy music!

01:28.400 --> 01:32.159
Because nothing really crappy has
happened in the last 24 hours.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.679
OK, only happy stuff.

01:34.680 --> 01:37.319
Like Megan asking Wes
to be her boyfriend.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.799
Happy!

01:39.800 --> 01:43.080
<font color="yellow">I have been single for two years.</font>
<font color="yellow">My mum is gonna be so happy!</font>

01:44.280 --> 01:47.480
<font color="cyan">Literally your veneers are out.</font>
<font color="yellow">I can't put 'em away.</font>

01:49.320 --> 01:52.119
<font color="yellow">I am literally, like, blushing.</font>
<c.color008000>I can't stop smiling.</font>

01:52.120 --> 01:54.359
<c.color008000>I am not sleeping tonight.</font>
<c.color008000>I mean, I'm not.</font>

01:54.360 --> 01:56.439
Alex, England are out.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.519
The hopes of a nation rest
on your shoulders.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.439
Now graft, Alexander, my son.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.159
Graft like you have
never grafted before.

02:03.160 --> 02:06.199
<font color="yellow">Can I just say, I have had</font>
<font color="yellow">the driest mouth all day.</font>

02:06.200 --> 02:09.038
<font color="cyan">Have you? Do you want</font>
<font color="cyan">a sip of my beer?</font>

02:09.039 --> 02:12.559
<font color="yellow">Maybe. I am proper gassy!</font>

02:12.560 --> 02:15.719
<font color="cyan">Gassy, that is fine.</font>
<font color="cyan">I've seen it all.</font>

02:15.720 --> 02:19.679
<font color="cyan">Throw my beer everywhere, why not?</font>
<font color="yellow">My God!</font>

02:19.680 --> 02:23.079
<font color="cyan">I am wearing the wrong jeans,</font>
<font color="cyan">aren't I?</font>

02:23.080 --> 02:25.639
<c.color008000>He keeps making her laugh,</font>
<c.color008000>don't you?</font>

02:25.640 --> 02:27.879
<font color="cyan">Don't look over.</font>

02:27.880 --> 02:30.399
<font color="yellow">But the thing is, you are so great,</font>

02:30.400 --> 02:33.599
<font color="yellow">the place I have grown up,</font>
<font color="yellow">the people I have been around,</font>

02:33.600 --> 02:36.799
<font color="yellow">your sense of humour, I just get it.</font>

02:36.800 --> 02:39.280
<font color="yellow">You make me laugh so much.</font>

02:41.720 --> 02:44.239
<font color="cyan">I am bloody weird, I am.</font>
<font color="yellow">No, but you make me laugh.</font>

02:44.240 --> 02:46.359
<c.color008000>I am fucking hoping.</font>

02:46.360 --> 02:48.319
<font color="cyan">I wish I knew what</font>
<font color="cyan">body language meant.</font>

02:48.320 --> 02:51.799
<font color="yellow">He is very open, she's quite</font>
<font color="yellow">closed at the moment.</font>

02:51.800 --> 02:55.759
<c.color008000>If you sit like this, yeah,</font>
<c.color008000>you are closed.</font>

02:55.760 --> 02:58.599
<font color="yellow">You are a bloody great guy.</font>
<font color="cyan">Thank you.</font>

02:58.600 --> 03:01.079
<font color="yellow">But I need to make sure that,</font>
<font color="yellow">you know, within my heart</font>

03:01.080 --> 03:04.079
<font color="yellow">that is how I feel.</font>
<font color="yellow">I know you respect that.</font>

03:04.080 --> 03:05.839
<font color="cyan">Just enjoy yourself as well.</font>

03:05.840 --> 03:08.919
<font color="yellow">Everybody is so protective over you</font>
<font color="yellow">and I want you to be yourself.</font>

03:08.920 --> 03:11.759
<font color="yellow">I want you to feel relaxed around me</font>
<font color="yellow">and I want to feel relaxed.</font>

03:11.760 --> 03:14.159
<font color="yellow">I feel like that is the only way...</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah, sure.</font>

03:14.160 --> 03:17.639
<font color="yellow">..that something may</font>
<font color="yellow">possibly progress.</font>

03:17.640 --> 03:19.959
<font color="yellow">Idris made me feel so at ease.</font>

03:19.960 --> 03:23.039
<font color="yellow">And we spoke about certain things,</font>
<font color="yellow">we have some common interests.</font>

03:23.040 --> 03:26.319
<font color="cyan">At the end of the day, if you have a</font>
<font color="cyan">better connection with someone else</font>

03:26.320 --> 03:28.839
<font color="cyan">you should go for them, and I am not</font>
<font color="cyan">gonna pressure you.</font>

03:28.840 --> 03:31.799
<font color="cyan">People might put pressure but I</font>
<font color="cyan">would never put pressure on you.</font>

03:31.800 --> 03:33.439
<font color="cyan">I am not like that.</font>

03:33.440 --> 03:36.919
<font color="yellow">Thing is, I don't like pressure</font>
<font color="yellow">but I love confidence.</font>

03:36.920 --> 03:38.959
<font color="cyan">I think it is difficult for me</font>

03:38.960 --> 03:42.479
<font color="cyan">because I want to, you know,</font>
<font color="cyan">show you that I'm interested,</font>

03:42.480 --> 03:44.399
<font color="cyan">show you the confidence I do have.</font>

03:44.400 --> 03:46.399
<font color="cyan">I may not be the loudest person</font>
<font color="cyan">in the room</font>

03:46.400 --> 03:48.239
<font color="cyan">but I am certainly not shy.</font>

03:48.240 --> 03:50.319
<font color="cyan">At the same time I don't</font>
<font color="cyan">want to make you feel</font>

03:50.320 --> 03:52.319
<font color="cyan">like you can't talk to other people.</font>

03:52.320 --> 03:54.159
<font color="cyan">I think you should get to know...</font>

03:54.160 --> 03:56.639
<font color="cyan">I think you should get to know every</font>
<font color="cyan">guy that is single.</font>

03:56.640 --> 03:58.759
<font color="yellow">Alex has grown on me so much today.</font>

03:58.760 --> 04:01.279
<font color="yellow">The more I speak to Alex</font>
<font color="yellow">the more I'm attracted to him.</font>

04:01.280 --> 04:04.639
<font color="yellow">He just understands.</font>
<font color="yellow">We just communicate so well.</font>

04:04.640 --> 04:06.999
<font color="yellow">And that is what I am looking for.</font>

04:07.000 --> 04:10.159
Georgia is all about a certain word
starting with the letter L.

04:10.160 --> 04:13.599
Not liar, you are
all very bad people. Loyal.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.959
But has her date with Kieren
tempted her away from Sam?

04:16.959 --> 04:19.119
<font color="yellow">I just kind of felt like</font>

04:19.120 --> 04:22.399
<font color="yellow">today I wanted to get to know you</font>
<font color="yellow">even more after our date.</font>

04:22.400 --> 04:25.759
<font color="yellow">I thought our date was quite good.</font>
<font color="yellow">How do you feel it went?</font>

04:25.760 --> 04:27.679
<font color="cyan">I think the date when really,</font>
<font color="cyan">really well.</font>

04:27.680 --> 04:30.919
<font color="cyan">I really enjoyed myself</font>
<font color="cyan">and I was very flattered</font>
<font color="cyan">that you took me out.</font>

04:30.920 --> 04:32.999
<font color="cyan">I thought it was really,</font>
<font color="cyan">really nice of you.</font>

04:33.000 --> 04:34.919
<font color="cyan">I definitely didn't expect it.</font>

04:34.920 --> 04:38.359
<font color="cyan">However, on the day,</font>
<font color="cyan">as much as it was good,</font>

04:38.360 --> 04:40.439
<font color="cyan">as soon as I got back to the villa</font>

04:40.440 --> 04:42.479
<font color="cyan">the first thing I wanted to do</font>
<font color="cyan">was speak to Sam.</font>

04:42.480 --> 04:45.519
<font color="yellow">Do you feel like you have got</font>
<font color="yellow">something there with Sam?</font>

04:45.520 --> 04:48.279
<font color="yellow">It could potentially</font>
<font color="yellow">be a relationship? </font><font color="cyan"> Yes.</font>

04:48.280 --> 04:51.839
<font color="yellow">Really? I feel like he has</font>
<font color="yellow">been with you the whole day</font>

04:51.840 --> 04:55.879
<font color="yellow">to make sure I am not gonna come</font>
<font color="yellow">and get in his way.</font>

04:55.880 --> 04:59.039
<font color="yellow">You don't feel he has changed the</font>
<font color="yellow">way he is with you</font>

04:59.040 --> 05:00.879
<font color="yellow">since I have come in?</font>

05:00.880 --> 05:04.119
<font color="yellow">You are still OK with me just</font>
<font color="yellow">generally chatting,</font>

05:04.120 --> 05:06.719
<font color="yellow">seeing how things are going?</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah, of course.</font>

05:06.720 --> 05:09.719
<font color="yellow">I don't want to come across and have</font>
<font color="yellow">to grill you every time I see you.</font>

05:09.720 --> 05:12.399
<font color="cyan">No, don't be silly. </font><font color="yellow"> That is not nice</font>
<font color="yellow">for me or for you.</font>

05:12.400 --> 05:14.959
<font color="cyan">Of course I am always open,</font>

05:14.960 --> 05:18.719
<font color="cyan">but at the moment, what I</font>
<font color="cyan">have got with Sam right now,</font>

05:18.720 --> 05:20.479
<font color="cyan">it is really good.</font>

05:20.480 --> 05:22.879
<font color="cyan">Probably the best thing</font>
<font color="cyan">I've had in this villa.</font>

05:22.880 --> 05:24.999
<font color="yellow">Really? OK.</font>

05:25.000 --> 05:28.079
<font color="cyan">When I was speaking to Kieren</font>
<font color="cyan">and telling him how I felt,</font>

05:28.080 --> 05:30.559
<font color="cyan">he even then at the end</font>
<font color="cyan">of the conversation said,</font>

05:30.560 --> 05:32.199
<font color="cyan">can I still crack on?</font>

05:32.200 --> 05:35.119
<font color="cyan">I was like, no,</font>
<font color="cyan">please take the hint.</font>

05:35.120 --> 05:37.639
<font color="cyan">However, I felt he didn't.</font>

05:37.640 --> 05:40.879
So Georgia is sticking with
her fella because, as we all know,

05:40.880 --> 05:43.520
a burnt man in the hand
is worth two in the bush.

05:46.120 --> 05:47.760
<font color="cyan">Sit down.</font>

05:57.120 --> 05:58.959
<font color="yellow">And was like...</font>

05:58.960 --> 06:01.799
<font color="yellow">I just want to know</font>
<font color="yellow">where your head's at.</font>

06:01.800 --> 06:03.479
<font color="yellow">I was like, OK.</font>

06:03.480 --> 06:05.839
<font color="yellow">He was like, I felt like</font>
<font color="yellow">we had a really good date.</font>

06:05.840 --> 06:08.439
<font color="yellow">And I was like, yes, so did I.</font>

06:08.440 --> 06:10.639
<font color="yellow">I felt like Sam was really</font>
<font color="yellow">smothering you today.</font>

06:10.640 --> 06:14.559
<font color="yellow">I was like, right. OK. Yeah.</font>

06:14.560 --> 06:19.879
<font color="cyan">He's one of them, is he?</font>
<font color="cyan">He's doing that thing, is he?</font>

06:19.880 --> 06:22.319
<font color="yellow">He basically said to me,</font>
<font color="yellow">he was like,</font>

06:22.320 --> 06:24.079
<font color="yellow">well, I still want</font>
<font color="yellow">to get to know you.</font>

06:24.080 --> 06:25.919
<font color="yellow">I still want to crack on with you.</font>

06:25.920 --> 06:27.879
<font color="yellow">How do you feel about that?</font>

06:27.880 --> 06:30.959
<font color="yellow">And I was like, erm...</font>

06:30.960 --> 06:33.039
<font color="yellow">well, I'm open to</font>
<font color="yellow">getting to know you</font>

06:33.040 --> 06:35.279
<font color="yellow">but right now I'm putting</font>
<font color="yellow">all my energy into Sam.</font>

06:35.280 --> 06:39.279
<font color="cyan">I might speak to him.</font>
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

06:39.280 --> 06:41.439
<font color="yellow">Oh, God!</font>

06:41.440 --> 06:44.759
<font color="cyan">It is a slimy card saying that</font>
<font color="cyan">I was all over you,</font>

06:44.760 --> 06:46.800
<font color="cyan">that is annoying. Weirdo.</font>

06:48.320 --> 06:50.359
<font color="yellow">At the end of the day I didn't want</font>
<font color="yellow">to be rude,</font>

06:50.360 --> 06:52.559
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to be negative,</font>

06:52.560 --> 06:55.359
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to make him feel bad.</font>

06:55.360 --> 06:58.519
<font color="yellow">However, it did make</font>
<font color="yellow">me realise I am into Sam</font>

06:58.520 --> 07:02.959
<font color="yellow">and sometimes that is just</font>
<font color="yellow">the way the cookie crumbles.</font>

07:02.960 --> 07:06.320
<font color="cyan">Yo, Kieran, can I grab you quickly?</font>
<c.color008000>Yes, mate.</font>

07:11.640 --> 07:13.959
<font color="cyan">When someone says to you, like,</font>

07:13.960 --> 07:16.279
<font color="cyan">I am happy with someone,</font>
<font color="cyan">don't graft me,</font>

07:16.280 --> 07:20.159
<font color="cyan">it will not be romantic,</font>
<font color="cyan">and they ignore that,</font>
<font color="cyan">I think that is a bit disrespectful.</font>

07:20.160 --> 07:22.919
<font color="cyan">So I wanted to nip things</font>
<font color="cyan">in the bud and tell him, like,</font>

07:22.920 --> 07:24.479
<font color="cyan">I am going to get annoyed.</font>

07:24.480 --> 07:26.639
<c.color008000>How you doing, mate?</font>
<font color="cyan">Good, you?</font>

07:26.640 --> 07:28.319
<c.color008000>Yeah, I'm all right.</font>

07:28.320 --> 07:30.279
<font color="cyan">I wanted a quick chat to you.</font>

07:30.280 --> 07:32.799
<font color="cyan">Obviously, I want to have a chat,</font>
<font color="cyan">like,</font>

07:32.800 --> 07:36.719
<font color="cyan">Georgia did come back from the date</font>
<font color="cyan">and she said she had a good time.</font>

07:36.720 --> 07:40.359
<font color="cyan">And she said that when she</font>
<font color="cyan">got back she kind of realised</font>

07:40.360 --> 07:44.159
<font color="cyan">that her feelings for me</font>
<font color="cyan">were more than she thought.</font>

07:44.160 --> 07:47.159
<c.color008000>Yeah, yeah. That is what</font>
<c.color008000>she said to me earlier.</font>

07:47.160 --> 07:50.679
<font color="cyan">What annoyed me, mate,</font>
<font color="cyan">is you played a bit of a low blow,</font>

07:50.680 --> 07:53.279
<font color="cyan">saying that I had</font>
<font color="cyan">been smothering her.</font>

07:53.280 --> 07:55.799
<font color="cyan">The reason we have</font>
<font color="cyan">been close today -</font>

07:55.800 --> 07:57.559
<c.color008000>I am not saying you</font>
<c.color008000>are smothering her -</font>

07:57.560 --> 08:01.199
<font color="cyan">the reason we have been close is</font>
<font color="cyan">because I feel really strongly</font>
<font color="cyan">towards her.</font>

08:01.200 --> 08:02.959
<font color="cyan">I really do like her.</font>

08:02.960 --> 08:05.959
<font color="cyan">It is really hard for Georgia</font>
<font color="cyan">to tell someone how she feels.</font>

08:05.960 --> 08:09.719
<c.color008000>We can agree to disagree. you have</font>
<c.color008000>spent a lot of time with Georgia.</font>

08:09.720 --> 08:13.079
<c.color008000>Of course I could have come over</font>
<c.color008000>and grabbed Georgia at any point,</font>

08:13.080 --> 08:15.399
<c.color008000>I just thought,</font>
<c.color008000>I had a date with her last night,</font>

08:15.400 --> 08:17.559
<c.color008000>you are not going</font>
<c.color008000>to be too happy with me.</font>

08:17.560 --> 08:20.879
<font color="cyan">The best thing about George is that</font>
<font color="cyan">she is loyal and very honest.</font>

08:20.880 --> 08:24.239
<font color="cyan">If she didn't...</font>
<font color="cyan">if she didn't like me in that way</font>

08:24.240 --> 08:26.719
<font color="cyan">or she fancied you,</font>
<font color="cyan">she would tell me.</font>

08:26.720 --> 08:28.839
<font color="cyan">Like, straightaway.</font>
<font color="cyan">100% I know that.</font>

08:28.840 --> 08:30.400
<c.color008000>Yeah, of course.</font>

08:33.559 --> 08:35.359
He struck out with Georgia

08:35.360 --> 08:37.839
but Kieren has still got a
whole lot of graft to give.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.239
Now he is cracking
on with Alexandra.

08:40.240 --> 08:43.198
Don't sit too close, mate,
she is still a bit windy.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.479
<font color="yellow">Tell me a bit more</font>
<font color="yellow">about what you do.</font>

08:45.480 --> 08:49.159
<font color="cyan">I assisted for a year,</font>
<font color="cyan">I worked for free for a year</font>
<font color="cyan">as a make-up artist.</font>

08:49.160 --> 08:52.079
<font color="yellow">That's mad.</font>
<font color="yellow">You must have enjoyed it, then.</font>

08:52.080 --> 08:54.839
<font color="cyan">I loved it.</font>
<font color="cyan">It is what I wanted to do.</font>

08:54.840 --> 08:58.639
<font color="cyan">When I am into something,</font>
<font color="cyan">I give it wholeheartedly.</font>

08:58.640 --> 09:01.319
<font color="yellow">You travel for work, right?</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

09:01.320 --> 09:07.279
<font color="yellow">I've been to Australia, Hong Kong,</font>
<font color="yellow">Greece, Spain, Germany.</font>

09:07.280 --> 09:09.759
<font color="yellow">It would be nice to be able</font>
<font color="yellow">to do that with somebody.</font>

09:09.760 --> 09:11.479
<font color="cyan">Maybe I'll come with you.</font>
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

09:11.480 --> 09:13.439
<font color="cyan">You never know.</font>
<font color="yellow">Do you get to travel much?</font>

09:13.440 --> 09:16.039
<font color="cyan">I am not well travelled, no.</font>
<font color="cyan">I am really not.</font>

09:16.040 --> 09:19.039
<font color="cyan">It could be a potential</font>
<font color="cyan">thing for us to do.</font>

09:19.040 --> 09:22.119
<font color="yellow">Why is that?</font>
<font color="cyan">I guess I'm just a late starter.</font>

09:22.120 --> 09:24.479
<font color="cyan">I do really want to travel.</font>

09:24.480 --> 09:26.719
<font color="cyan">I want to do south-east</font>
<font color="cyan">Asia and stuff.</font>

09:26.720 --> 09:29.559
<font color="cyan">I am really into food.</font>
<font color="yellow">Are you a massive foodie?</font>

09:29.560 --> 09:31.279
<font color="cyan">A massive foodie.</font>

09:31.280 --> 09:34.039
<font color="cyan">It would definitely be good</font>
<font color="cyan">to get to know you a lot more.</font>

09:34.040 --> 09:36.199
<font color="cyan">It was nice to get Alexandra</font>
<font color="cyan">to open up</font>

09:36.200 --> 09:37.959
<font color="cyan">and have a little chat with me.</font>

09:37.960 --> 09:41.159
<font color="cyan">I do find her attractive. I'm going</font>
<font color="cyan">to start chatting to her a lot more.</font>

09:41.160 --> 09:44.199
<font color="cyan">It would be nice if we could maybe</font>
<font color="cyan">eventually couple up.</font>

09:44.200 --> 09:46.639
<font color="cyan">You don't know,</font>
<font color="cyan">things move quickly in here.</font>

09:46.640 --> 09:49.520
<font color="cyan">We will just see how things,</font>
<font color="cyan">you know, proceed.</font>

09:51.960 --> 09:54.559
Kieren has headed off
to crack on with a fridge

09:54.560 --> 09:58.119
and elsewhere in the villa
love is very much in the air.

09:58.120 --> 10:01.039
<font color="yellow">This time yesterday</font>
<font color="yellow">I was pranging out</font>

10:01.040 --> 10:04.239
<font color="yellow">and today I feel like this has been</font>
<font color="yellow">the first day in a long time</font>

10:04.240 --> 10:06.599
<font color="yellow">where I feel like there is no drama.</font>

10:06.600 --> 10:10.799
<font color="yellow">I feel like it has just been good</font>
<font color="yellow">between me and you. </font><font color="cyan"> That's cute.</font>

10:10.800 --> 10:13.199
<c.color008000>I can't believe yous are</font>
<c.color008000>boyfriend and girlfriend.</font>

10:13.200 --> 10:14.839
<c.color008000>I am so happy.</font>

10:14.840 --> 10:16.920
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I asked you.</font>

10:19.120 --> 10:21.799
Sadly not everyone
is feeling the love.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.199
Samira is feeling
the loss of Frankie.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.480
<font color="yellow">We have been here from the start</font>
<font color="yellow">and I finally got what I wanted.</font>

10:28.640 --> 10:32.480
<font color="yellow">And I now feel like I am back</font>
<font color="yellow">at square one but worse.</font>

10:34.160 --> 10:36.399
<font color="yellow">Oh!</font>

10:36.400 --> 10:38.319
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

10:38.320 --> 10:39.800
<font color="cyan">Sam...</font>

10:41.320 --> 10:42.999
<font color="yellow">Obviously Frankie is gone</font>

10:43.000 --> 10:45.679
<font color="yellow">and I had a little bit</font>
<font color="yellow">of what I could have.</font>

10:45.680 --> 10:47.319
<font color="yellow">And I really liked it.</font>

10:47.320 --> 10:50.279
<font color="yellow">But I don't feel like</font>
<font color="yellow">I am going to meet anyone else</font>

10:50.280 --> 10:52.119
<font color="yellow">and have a connection</font>
<font color="yellow">with anyone else.</font>

10:52.120 --> 10:54.399
<font color="yellow">You know how hard it is</font>
<font color="yellow">for me to meet someone</font>

10:54.400 --> 10:56.799
<font color="yellow">and actually get a</font>
<font color="yellow">connection with them.</font>

10:56.800 --> 10:59.919
<font color="yellow">And then also,</font>
<font color="yellow">all my best mates are moving on.</font>

10:59.920 --> 11:02.440
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>
<font color="yellow">In here. You know what I mean?</font>

11:03.840 --> 11:07.439
<font color="yellow">I have to think about my happiness</font>
<font color="yellow">in here, and I am not happy.</font>

11:07.440 --> 11:10.039
<font color="yellow">Because I am on my own.</font>

11:10.040 --> 11:12.879
<font color="cyan">I just don't want you to go.</font>
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

11:12.880 --> 11:14.599
<font color="yellow">But like...</font>

11:14.600 --> 11:16.920
<font color="yellow">I need to do it.</font>

11:18.560 --> 11:20.560
<font color="cyan">You actually think you are gonna go?</font>

11:23.160 --> 11:25.679
<font color="cyan">You have been here</font>
<font color="cyan">from the start with me</font>

11:25.680 --> 11:27.560
<font color="cyan">and I have grown with you.</font>

11:28.760 --> 11:31.639
<font color="cyan">You are like my best mate.</font>
<font color="yellow">I know, I will be.</font>

11:31.640 --> 11:33.439
<font color="cyan">Why can't my best mate be happy?</font>

11:33.440 --> 11:36.959
<font color="cyan">It is horrible, because like, I see</font>
<font color="cyan">everyone happy and growing in here,</font>

11:36.960 --> 11:39.359
<font color="cyan">and a look at them and I think,</font>
<font color="cyan">why can't that be you?</font>

11:39.360 --> 11:41.679
<font color="yellow">I want to stay so bad.</font>
<font color="cyan">I want you to stay.</font>

11:41.680 --> 11:44.079
<font color="yellow">But I can't be happy in here.</font>

11:44.080 --> 11:46.200
<font color="yellow">Any more.</font>

11:49.840 --> 11:52.999
<font color="cyan">I just want you to...</font>
<font color="yellow">I am going to go to sleep tonight.</font>

11:53.000 --> 11:57.360
<font color="cyan">And if you wake up in the morning</font>
<font color="cyan">and you feel like this then fine.</font>

11:59.080 --> 12:01.479
<font color="cyan">I love you.</font>

12:01.480 --> 12:04.759
<font color="cyan">If you are not grafting or</font>
<font color="cyan">in a couple with anyone,</font>

12:04.760 --> 12:07.799
<font color="cyan">if you don't want to continue</font>
<font color="cyan">something with someone in the villa</font>

12:07.800 --> 12:09.559
<font color="cyan">it is hard to be here.</font>

12:09.560 --> 12:13.319
<font color="cyan">And because Frankie has gone</font>
<font color="cyan">I don't have that to continue with.</font>

12:13.320 --> 12:15.879
<c.color008000># Will you still be here tomorrow?</font>

12:15.880 --> 12:18.880
<c.color008000># Or will you leave in</font>
<c.color008000>the dead of the night?</font>

12:21.480 --> 12:23.599
<font color="yellow">It's not me.</font>

12:23.600 --> 12:27.879
Alex is giving new girl Alexandra
a bed to herself,

12:27.880 --> 12:31.159
partly because he is a gentleman,
mainly to avoid a Dutch oven.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.280
So him and Samira are on the sofa.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.800
<font color="cyan">Thanks for everything.</font>

12:41.120 --> 12:43.959
<c.color008000># Will you still be here tomorrow?</font>

12:43.960 --> 12:47.159
<c.color008000># Or will you leave in the dead</font>
<c.color008000>of the night?</font>

12:47.160 --> 12:51.679
<font color="yellow">Please don't, Megan.</font>
<font color="cyan">Please don't, Megan, my girlfriend.</font>

12:51.680 --> 12:54.279
<c.color008000>Aww!</font>

12:54.280 --> 12:58.360
<c.color008000># If I make myself like</font>
<c.color008000>a feather in your hair</font>

13:00.640 --> 13:09.959
<c.color008000># And put my trust in love...</font>

13:09.960 --> 13:12.879
<c.color008000># Will you still be here tomorrow?</font>

13:12.880 --> 13:15.680
<c.color008000># Or will you leave</font>
<c.color008000>in the dead of the night?</font>

13:26.560 --> 13:27.959
Coming up...

13:27.960 --> 13:29.879
Samira says her goodbyes.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.760
<font color="yellow">You know what?</font>
<font color="yellow">Like... it is my time to go.</font>

13:42.840 --> 13:46.559
Get ready everyone,
it's another day in paradise.

13:46.560 --> 13:49.359
<font color="yellow"># Your love gets sweeter every day</font>

13:49.360 --> 13:51.760
<font color="yellow"># Your love gets sweeter every day</font>

13:56.920 --> 14:00.000
<font color="cyan">I can't get rid of him.</font>
<c.color008000>Alex is back!</font>

14:05.200 --> 14:08.039
Last night Megan whispered those
three magic words

14:08.040 --> 14:09.679
I like to say every morning

14:09.680 --> 14:11.679
when I look at myself in the
bathroom mirror.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.439
"I love you."

14:13.440 --> 14:17.640
<font color="yellow">I am glad I've got you.</font>
<font color="cyan">I'm really glad I've got you.</font>

14:22.560 --> 14:24.719
<font color="yellow">So... I may have said something</font>

14:24.720 --> 14:27.200
<font color="yellow">but I didn't mean it,</font>
<font color="yellow">just come out in the moment.</font>

14:29.640 --> 14:32.279
<font color="cyan">I thought I heard you say that.</font>

14:32.280 --> 14:35.439
<font color="yellow">But I didn't mean it!</font>
<font color="yellow">It just felt really nice.</font>

14:35.440 --> 14:37.519
<font color="cyan">I thought I heard you say it.</font>

14:37.520 --> 14:39.719
<font color="cyan">I was like... I didn't hear that.</font>

14:39.720 --> 14:41.959
<font color="cyan">I was gonna say...</font>
<font color="cyan">I didn't want to say, what?</font>

14:41.960 --> 14:44.999
<font color="yellow">I may have let the L bomb slip out.</font>

14:45.000 --> 14:47.279
<font color="yellow">I may love him a little bit.</font>

14:47.280 --> 14:50.999
<font color="yellow">But it's just very soon and I don't</font>
<font color="yellow">want to be like too much</font>

14:51.000 --> 14:52.759
<font color="yellow">and scare the poor boy away.</font>

14:52.760 --> 14:55.599
<font color="yellow">It was a cute moment and it just</font>
<font color="yellow">felt right to say it.</font>

14:55.600 --> 14:58.839
<font color="yellow">But just erase it from your mind.</font>

14:58.840 --> 15:01.799
<font color="yellow">It was just in the moment, OK?</font>

15:01.800 --> 15:04.319
<font color="yellow">You know when you</font>
<font color="yellow">just get carried away.</font>

15:04.320 --> 15:06.880
<font color="yellow">It was just special.</font>

15:12.000 --> 15:13.280
<font color="yellow">Hmm?</font>

15:19.480 --> 15:21.520
<font color="cyan">Dinner? Yep?</font>

15:23.120 --> 15:25.999
Alex wants to get to know more about
Alexandra.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.039
What are her interests?
What makes her laugh?

15:29.040 --> 15:31.519
Would she mind
sleeping on the sofa tomorrow night?

15:31.520 --> 15:33.439
<font color="yellow">The thing is,</font>
<font color="yellow">I need to get to know her.</font>

15:33.440 --> 15:35.959
<font color="yellow">She knows a lot more about me</font>
<font color="yellow">than I know about her.</font>

15:35.960 --> 15:38.719
<font color="cyan">Exactly, exactly.</font>
<font color="yellow">For me it is a two-way thing.</font>

15:38.720 --> 15:40.719
<font color="yellow">I think there is a</font>
<font color="yellow">lot of potential there</font>

15:40.720 --> 15:42.399
<font color="yellow">but I can't be sure right now.</font>

15:42.400 --> 15:44.239
<font color="yellow">I feel like we are getting on.</font>

15:44.240 --> 15:46.359
<font color="yellow">I think there is definitely</font>
<font color="yellow">something there</font>

15:46.360 --> 15:48.999
<font color="yellow">and I think she has got...</font>
<font color="yellow">She has got what I'm looking for.</font>

15:49.000 --> 15:51.839
<font color="yellow">I'm hoping that grows</font>
<font color="yellow">and there is that connection.</font>

15:51.840 --> 15:54.319
<font color="cyan">She is a triple B,</font>
<font color="cyan">no doubt about it.</font>

15:54.320 --> 15:56.719
<font color="cyan">Big, booty, brunette.</font>

15:56.720 --> 15:59.319
<font color="yellow">Yeah, she's hot, man.</font>
<font color="yellow">And very natural.</font>

15:59.320 --> 16:01.399
<font color="cyan">And genuine, I find.</font>

16:01.400 --> 16:04.239
<font color="yellow">POA is just... continue.</font>

16:04.240 --> 16:06.520
<font color="cyan">Just keep doing what you're doing.</font>

16:07.760 --> 16:12.039
Alexandra's facing a tough choice -
do I go for Kieran, Idris or Alex?

16:12.040 --> 16:15.639
Luckily Laura and Ellie are on hand
with some impartial advice.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.799
"It's your decision babe.

16:17.800 --> 16:21.199
Feel free to fall in love with Alex
in any way you want."

16:21.200 --> 16:26.159
<font color="yellow">There are three single guys in here.</font>
<font color="yellow">They have all expressed an interest.</font>

16:26.160 --> 16:32.759
<font color="cyan">I guess we know Alex more. It is</font>
<font color="cyan">nice watching you get on. I think</font>

16:32.760 --> 16:37.999
<font color="cyan">they are all so cool,</font>
<font color="cyan">trying to play it cool.</font>

16:38.000 --> 16:40.839
<font color="cyan">There is a fine line between making</font>
<font color="cyan">an effort</font>

16:40.840 --> 16:47.959
<font color="cyan">and playing it to cool, you need to</font>
<font color="cyan">see what suits you.</font>

16:47.960 --> 16:51.079
<c.color008000>I just hope, and what</font>
<c.color008000>worries me about Kieren,</font>

16:51.080 --> 16:56.159
<c.color008000>if Georgia had gone for him</font>
<c.color008000>would he still try?</font>

16:56.160 --> 17:04.719
<font color="cyan">I was Alex came back from the date</font>
<font color="cyan">and had never been happier.</font>

17:04.720 --> 17:08.240
<c.color008000>He was buzzing.</font>
<font color="cyan">It is nice to be appreciated.</font>

17:13.760 --> 17:18.319
After some tough days in the villa,
Samira's come to a big decision.

17:18.319 --> 17:26.358
<font color="yellow">So, my lovely, beautiful girls, so</font>
<font color="yellow">obviously you guys have known...</font>

17:26.359 --> 17:29.600
<font color="cyan">It is all right, take a minute.</font>

17:33.800 --> 17:38.520
<font color="yellow">You guys know that I have had</font>
<font color="yellow">a really tough couple of days</font>
<font color="yellow">recently.</font>

17:40.240 --> 17:43.759
<font color="yellow">And I have been umming and</font>
<font color="yellow">ahing about leaving.</font>

17:43.760 --> 17:50.719
<font color="yellow">I don't think the man of my dreams</font>
<font color="yellow">will walk in here.</font>

17:50.720 --> 17:55.680
<font color="yellow">I sat up and thought, you know what?</font>
<font color="yellow">It is my time to go.</font>

17:57.560 --> 18:01.159
<font color="yellow">I can't even, like,</font>
<font color="yellow">do you know what I mean?</font>

18:01.160 --> 18:06.119
<font color="yellow">This decision is so hard.</font>
<font color="yellow">I am literally devastated.</font>

18:06.120 --> 18:11.639
<font color="yellow">But I think that it is, like,</font>
<font color="yellow">the right thing to do.</font>

18:11.640 --> 18:14.199
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I will never forget you</font>
<font color="yellow">guys.</font>

18:14.200 --> 18:16.599
<font color="yellow">Just follow my heart, I have never</font>
<font color="yellow">done that before</font>

18:16.600 --> 18:18.599
<font color="yellow">and have taken a backseat</font>

18:18.600 --> 18:23.959
<font color="yellow">and now I need to go for it head on</font>
<font color="yellow">and leave and go for Frankie.</font>

18:23.960 --> 18:29.359
<font color="yellow">I have to do this for me.</font>
<font color="yellow">I have never felt so strong.</font>

18:29.360 --> 18:34.319
<font color="cyan">You seem happier, having made</font>
<font color="cyan">up your mind.</font>

18:34.320 --> 18:38.559
<font color="cyan">I love Wes but I love you equally!</font>

18:38.560 --> 18:41.439
<font color="cyan">I never thought I would</font>
<font color="cyan">come in and love a girl so much.</font>

18:41.440 --> 18:45.639
<font color="cyan">From a selfish point of view I would</font>
<font color="cyan">love her to stay,</font>

18:45.640 --> 18:48.399
<font color="cyan">but I know she is making</font>
<font color="cyan">the right decision.</font>

18:48.400 --> 18:52.239
<font color="cyan">As soon as she sees Frankie</font>
<font color="cyan">she can move on.</font>

18:52.240 --> 18:55.999
<font color="cyan">It would be torture here staying and</font>
<font color="cyan">watching couples grow</font>

18:56.000 --> 18:58.359
<font color="cyan">and get closer</font>
<font color="cyan">while she was beginning</font>

18:58.360 --> 19:00.919
<font color="cyan">to get that way with Frankie</font>
<font color="cyan">and he is gone.</font>

19:00.920 --> 19:02.239
<font color="yellow">I love you girls so much.</font>

19:02.240 --> 19:05.999
<c.color008000>She is just amazing.</font>
<c.color008000>It is waking up and thinking,</font>

19:06.000 --> 19:08.879
<c.color008000>"I feel a bit down today.</font>
<c.color008000>Where is Sam?"</font>

19:08.880 --> 19:10.799
<c.color008000>It is not nice.</font>

19:10.800 --> 19:13.639
<c.color008000>Can everyone sit</font>
<c.color008000>around the fire pit?</font>

19:13.640 --> 19:22.040
<c.color008000>Sam looked after me</font>
<c.color008000>when I felt shit.</font>

19:28.320 --> 19:30.079
<font color="yellow">Guys.</font>

19:30.080 --> 19:32.680
<font color="cyan">Don't even do this.</font>

19:37.040 --> 19:38.599
<c.color008000>Come on, man.</font>

19:38.600 --> 19:45.880
<font color="yellow">Obviously, these past couple of days</font>
<font color="yellow">I haven't been myself.</font>

19:48.720 --> 19:52.519
<font color="yellow">And I have struggled to be happy</font>
<font color="yellow">in here and have fun.</font>

19:52.520 --> 19:58.279
<font color="yellow">And I had a taste of what I wanted.</font>
<font color="yellow">With Frankie.</font>

19:58.280 --> 20:01.279
<font color="yellow">It was just gone.</font>

20:01.280 --> 20:04.319
<font color="yellow">I have really tried and been</font>
<font color="yellow">tossing and turning</font>

20:04.320 --> 20:06.679
<font color="yellow">about what I will do.</font>

20:06.680 --> 20:13.359
<font color="yellow">And I think the best thing</font>
<font color="yellow">for me to get closure on Frankie,</font>

20:13.360 --> 20:15.600
<font color="yellow">and for me to be happy...</font>

20:21.680 --> 20:23.600
<font color="yellow">..it is to go today.</font>

20:26.440 --> 20:28.240
<font color="cyan">I will miss you.</font>

20:31.680 --> 20:34.200
<font color="yellow">But it is a good thing. You know?</font>

20:35.960 --> 20:40.599
<c.color008000>She had a massive impact on me here.</font>
<c.color008000>More than she thinks she did.</font>

20:40.600 --> 20:43.199
<c.color008000>She will be missed.</font>

20:43.200 --> 20:46.440
<font color="yellow">I am really happy I am doing this</font>
<font color="yellow">and I feel strong.</font>

20:49.600 --> 20:52.119
<font color="cyan">She has been there from day one,</font>
<font color="cyan">part of the furniture.</font>

20:52.120 --> 20:54.799
<font color="cyan">To seeing her go,</font>
<font color="cyan">she will be missed.</font>

20:54.800 --> 20:56.839
<font color="yellow">It is so sad, I love all of you.</font>

20:56.840 --> 21:00.199
<c.color008000>She has been like a sister to me</font>
<c.color008000>and it has been mint.</font>

21:00.200 --> 21:02.599
<c.color008000>A sad day.</font>

21:02.600 --> 21:05.479
<font color="yellow">You are also amazing.</font>

21:05.480 --> 21:08.799
<font color="yellow">Each and every one of you will have</font>
<font color="yellow">something in my heart.</font>

21:08.800 --> 21:13.040
<font color="yellow">I will never forget any of you.</font>
<font color="yellow">Or anything.</font>

21:15.480 --> 21:17.559
<font color="cyan">I don't know what to feel,</font>
<font color="cyan">I am gutted.</font>

21:17.560 --> 21:21.079
<font color="cyan">I really hope that her and Frankie</font>
<font color="cyan">pick up where they left off.</font>

21:21.080 --> 21:23.559
<font color="cyan">But selfishly I am gutted.</font>

21:23.560 --> 21:26.439
<font color="cyan">Samira and I have had such a journey</font>
<font color="cyan">together,</font>

21:26.440 --> 21:29.879
<font color="cyan">she has been a part of everything</font>
<font color="cyan">that has happened here.</font>

21:29.880 --> 21:34.400
<font color="cyan">Her leaving is... I am gutted.</font>

21:38.360 --> 21:41.159
<font color="yellow">She is doing it for her,</font>
<font color="yellow">she was a big thing in the villa.</font>

21:41.160 --> 21:46.600
<c.color008000>I know it is right but I want her</font>
<c.color008000>to stay a little bit longer.</font>

21:48.120 --> 21:52.839
<c.color008000>I don't know,</font>
<c.color008000>she is just an individual.</font>

21:52.840 --> 21:55.439
<c.color008000>I have never met anyone like her.</font>

21:55.440 --> 22:00.599
<c.color008000>It was lovely to see her</font>
<c.color008000>and Frankie meet and grow.</font>

22:00.600 --> 22:05.879
<c.color008000>I know she just needs to go</font>
<c.color008000>and figure it out.</font>

22:05.880 --> 22:10.240
<font color="cyan">Samira, can I talk to you</font>
<font color="cyan">one to one?</font>

22:15.080 --> 22:20.599
<font color="cyan">I am gutted.</font>
<font color="yellow">I am too.</font>

22:20.600 --> 22:23.199
<font color="cyan">Absolutely gutted.</font>

22:23.200 --> 22:25.559
<font color="cyan">It is not me to be emotional,</font>

22:25.560 --> 22:29.559
<font color="cyan">but I don't know,</font>
<font color="cyan">you have always had my back.</font>

22:29.560 --> 22:35.039
<font color="yellow">Always. </font><font color="cyan"> Not having you here now,</font>
<font color="cyan">it is tough.</font>

22:35.040 --> 22:40.399
<font color="cyan">I have always known you have got my</font>
<font color="cyan">back more than any other girl.</font>

22:40.400 --> 22:42.679
<font color="cyan">As much as any other guy.</font>

22:42.680 --> 22:45.279
<font color="cyan">Not having you here now, it is shit.</font>

22:45.280 --> 22:47.879
<font color="cyan">We have been here five</font>
<font color="cyan">and a half weeks.</font>

22:47.880 --> 22:50.519
<font color="yellow">We have been here so long, we have</font>
<font color="yellow">shared a bed together,</font>

22:50.520 --> 22:55.319
<font color="yellow">I have shouted at you. I elbowed you</font>
<font color="yellow">in the night and spooned you.</font>

22:55.320 --> 22:58.199
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean to.</font>

22:58.200 --> 23:04.279
<font color="cyan">I am very sad but I am happy for</font>
<font color="cyan">you. Make it worthwhile.</font>

23:04.280 --> 23:06.600
<font color="yellow">It is the right thing, mate.</font>

23:12.040 --> 23:15.679
<font color="yellow">Honestly, you smash it.</font>

23:15.680 --> 23:22.079
<font color="yellow">Go get the girl. Go get her.</font>
<font color="yellow">You are perfect.</font>

23:22.080 --> 23:24.359
<font color="cyan">I will really miss you.</font>

23:24.360 --> 23:27.679
<font color="cyan">I feel like my comfort blanket</font>
<font color="cyan">has been pulled.</font>

23:27.680 --> 23:31.879
<font color="cyan">I know that is selfish,</font>
<font color="cyan">but having her there...</font>

23:31.880 --> 23:34.560
<font color="cyan">I will miss her a lot.</font>

23:35.760 --> 23:41.639
<font color="cyan">I actually wouldn't be here,</font>
<font color="cyan">if it wasn't for you.</font>

23:41.640 --> 23:44.759
<font color="cyan">Come on, I will get sad.</font>

23:44.760 --> 23:47.799
<font color="yellow">I love you so much.</font>

23:47.800 --> 23:50.639
<font color="yellow">I have got to go</font>
<font color="yellow">with my gut feeling.</font>

23:50.640 --> 23:53.799
<font color="yellow">I am not saying I am in love with</font>
<font color="yellow">Frankie and we will get married,</font>

23:53.800 --> 23:57.279
<font color="yellow">but I don't want to waste any time.</font>
<font color="yellow">I want to get there now and see him.</font>

23:57.280 --> 23:59.680
<font color="yellow">I know it is the right thing to do.</font>

24:03.960 --> 24:05.760
<font color="yellow">I am scared!</font>

24:08.040 --> 24:11.840
<font color="yellow">I love you guys. So, so much.</font>

24:13.960 --> 24:15.560
<font color="yellow">Love you!</font>

24:17.760 --> 24:24.280
<font color="cyan">Go on, Samira!</font>
<font color="cyan">Ira! Ira! Go on, Samira!</font>

24:33.040 --> 24:34.760
<font color="yellow">Oh, my God, I love you.</font>

24:49.120 --> 24:52.240
The boys get hotty... for the totty.

25:01.640 --> 25:04.439
Everyone's gathered round the pool.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.399
Well, everyone except Wes and Megan,

25:06.400 --> 25:09.160
they're probably off giving each
other "special cuddles".

25:10.200 --> 25:11.799
<font color="yellow">I have got a text!</font>

25:11.800 --> 25:13.360
(CHEERING)

25:24.240 --> 25:27.159
<font color="cyan">Challenge time. My favourite time.</font>

25:27.160 --> 25:30.800
<font color="cyan">I feel like we need a laugh,</font>
<font color="cyan">so I am so excited.</font>

25:33.360 --> 25:35.639
Oh, look, it's fireman Sam!

25:35.640 --> 25:39.200
And fireman Idris, and fireman Alex,
and fireman Jack. You get the idea.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.519
<font color="yellow">Oh, my God. A fireman is sexy.</font>

25:47.520 --> 25:52.359
<font color="yellow">They are the sexiest trade. A little</font>
<font color="yellow">bit dirty with their helmets on.</font>

25:52.360 --> 25:55.359
In today's challenge the boys are
going head to head

25:55.360 --> 25:57.199
in a sexy rescue mission.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.760
A sexy rescue mission?
Apparently that's a thing.

26:01.200 --> 26:04.239
Each boy starts the course
by stripping off to his pants.

26:04.240 --> 26:08.519
You heard me. And then sliding down,
oh, God, a fireman's pole.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.560
This is going to be a long day.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.639
Next he kicks down the door

26:13.640 --> 26:15.839
and rescues the girl
he's coupled up with.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.039
He then scoops his girl up
in a fireman's lift

26:18.040 --> 26:19.839
and carries her across the stage.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.759
All while being squirted
by fire hoses.

26:22.760 --> 26:26.679
Seriously, the challenge team need to
stop having brainstorms down the pub.

26:26.680 --> 26:29.519
Next, he gets himself
and his girl up on the wall.

26:29.520 --> 26:32.519
Then he runs across a load
of tyres before -

26:32.520 --> 26:36.600
Oh, dear God - doing 20 press
ups while getting a final squirting.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.479
Then it's back across the tyres,

26:41.480 --> 26:43.960
grab the girl and place her
on the final target.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.559
Finally he climbs up a rope

26:47.560 --> 26:50.719
to rescue a stuffed toy, hands it
to his girl and gets a snog.

26:50.720 --> 26:54.679
And the winner is the boy who puts
in the sexiest performance.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.079
You know I've got a law degree?

26:57.080 --> 27:01.999
<font color="yellow">Every bit of it was good. I swear he</font>
<font color="yellow">is so strong and big and tall.</font>

27:02.000 --> 27:05.839
<font color="yellow">He is so sexy.</font>

27:05.840 --> 27:08.599
<font color="cyan">If there weren't a fire to</font>
<font color="cyan">start with,</font>

27:08.600 --> 27:10.480
<font color="cyan">there was a fire after I finished.</font>

27:12.960 --> 27:15.439
<c.color008000>There was a fire burning?</font>

27:15.440 --> 27:19.640
<c.color008000>You know what?</font>
<c.color008000>You will get all-out caramel action.</font>

27:20.680 --> 27:22.880
<c.color008000>It is a bit hot.</font>

27:26.520 --> 27:28.120
<c.color008000>Give me more.</font>

27:31.320 --> 27:34.600
<font color="yellow">He was like...</font>
<font color="yellow">Oh, my God, I was like...</font>

27:43.320 --> 27:46.479
<font color="yellow">I didn't think it was possible</font>
<font color="yellow">to fancy him any more than I did.</font>

27:46.480 --> 27:48.479
<font color="yellow">Oh, my God!</font>

27:48.480 --> 27:50.920
(SCREAMING)

27:57.800 --> 28:00.279
<font color="yellow">That's mine.</font>

28:00.280 --> 28:03.240
<font color="yellow">I keep reliving it in my mind.</font>
<font color="yellow">Beautiful.</font>

28:04.360 --> 28:06.960
<font color="cyan">Someone call for fireman Sam?</font>

28:08.480 --> 28:11.039
<font color="cyan">It's a bit nerve wracking but once</font>
<font color="cyan">the hips start going</font>

28:11.040 --> 28:13.879
<font color="cyan">you get into the rhythm.</font>

28:13.880 --> 28:16.999
<c.color008000>I was standing behind</font>
<c.color008000>the door waiting for him to save me.</font>

28:17.000 --> 28:20.320
<c.color008000>Waiting a long time. If that was a</font>
<c.color008000>real fire I would have burned to a</font>
<c.color008000>crisp.</font>

28:22.200 --> 28:25.040
<c.color008000>I don't know why he was doing that</font>
<c.color008000>when I couldn't even see.</font>

28:32.560 --> 28:37.000
<c.color008000>It was like having a snog in the</font>
<c.color008000>rain, very, very romantic.</font>

28:41.400 --> 28:43.399
<font color="yellow">I tried making it as sexy as</font>
<font color="yellow">possible.</font>

28:43.400 --> 28:46.760
<font color="yellow">Whether that worked or not, I don't</font>
<font color="yellow">know. But I gave it a go.</font>

28:50.840 --> 28:57.200
<font color="cyan">I felt a little bit like...</font>
<font color="cyan">he is coming to get me.</font>

29:00.920 --> 29:02.800
<c.color008000>He killed the cat!</font>

29:04.200 --> 29:07.000
<font color="yellow">I killed the cat.</font>

29:09.160 --> 29:12.560
<font color="yellow">So I had to hand a dead cat to Dani.</font>
<font color="yellow">What a present.</font>

29:15.400 --> 29:18.800
<font color="cyan">Honestly, that outfit he is taken at</font>
<font color="cyan">home with us. We are having that.</font>

29:21.480 --> 29:27.520
<font color="yellow">Go on, Josh. </font><c.color008000> Ladies, is that burning</font>
<c.color008000>you can smell or is it... this?</font>

29:28.800 --> 29:32.480
<c.color008000>100% effort, zero percent technique.</font>

29:39.320 --> 29:42.480
<c.color008000>I thought I kept it</font>
<c.color008000>very, very, very sexy.</font>

29:45.320 --> 29:46.560
<c.color008000>Ish.</font>

29:53.800 --> 29:56.680
<font color="yellow">I was very impressed</font>
<font color="yellow">and happy with his performance.</font>

30:00.200 --> 30:04.160
<font color="cyan">To do a few funny things, that is</font>
<font color="cyan">when the bum comes into play.</font>

30:09.440 --> 30:11.200
<c.color008000>He has cute little cheeks.</font>

30:13.800 --> 30:15.799
<c.color008000>You want to squeeze them.</font>

30:15.800 --> 30:17.880
<font color="yellow">Well done, mate!</font>

30:21.680 --> 30:24.039
<font color="cyan">Does somebody smell burning?</font>

30:24.040 --> 30:26.519
Alex, Idris and Kieran are all single

30:26.520 --> 30:28.799
so they get to rescue the girl
of their choice -

30:28.800 --> 30:30.800
and they've all picked Alexandra.

30:37.680 --> 30:40.280
<font color="yellow">Ooh! Confident.</font>

30:43.440 --> 30:49.440
<font color="cyan">Ciaran's performance was off the</font>
<font color="cyan">chain. He did look so sexy.</font>

30:51.440 --> 30:54.679
<c.color008000>Lads were egging me on</font>
<c.color008000>so I was rolling with it.</font>

30:54.680 --> 30:56.680
<c.color008000>It turned out all right, I hope.</font>

31:09.640 --> 31:12.960
<font color="yellow">Was there a call for a fireman</font>
<font color="yellow">or the lurve doctor?!</font>

31:16.880 --> 31:20.039
<font color="yellow">I wanted to have a classy</font>
<font color="yellow">but fun vibe,</font>

31:20.040 --> 31:22.360
<font color="yellow">a readjustment of the choker.</font>

31:26.600 --> 31:30.119
<font color="cyan">I am just stood there thinking,</font>
<font color="cyan">I don't know if he can pick me up.</font>

31:30.120 --> 31:31.920
<font color="cyan">And he did, he bloody did.</font>

31:36.720 --> 31:40.399
<font color="yellow">It was a different kind of call than</font>
<font color="yellow">I am used to.</font>

31:40.400 --> 31:45.480
<font color="yellow">If all fails I can be a fireman</font>
<font color="yellow">or do a striptease.</font>

31:49.320 --> 31:51.800
<font color="cyan">He held his own and got a lovely</font>
<font color="cyan">kiss at the end.</font>

31:56.840 --> 31:59.480
<font color="yellow">She went and stuck the tongue in,</font>
<font color="yellow">I didn't see that coming.</font>

32:07.920 --> 32:09.879
<font color="yellow">Every girl likes a guy who is</font>
<font color="yellow">confident</font>

32:09.880 --> 32:12.959
<font color="yellow">and the fact I went for it,</font>

32:12.960 --> 32:16.479
<font color="yellow">I think that probably helped</font>
<font color="yellow">when it came to the kiss.</font>

32:16.480 --> 32:18.080
<font color="yellow">Maybe she was impressed.</font>

32:19.280 --> 32:22.159
<font color="cyan">Idris... Oh, Lord.</font>

32:22.160 --> 32:24.120
<c.color008000>Did someone say 911?</font>

32:29.440 --> 32:32.800
<c.color008000>What can I say? That challenge was</font>
<c.color008000>my cup of tea.</font>

32:36.800 --> 32:38.759
<font color="yellow">Definitely perving,</font>
<font color="yellow">I am not gonna lie.</font>

32:38.760 --> 32:41.840
<font color="yellow">You can appreciate a good thrusting.</font>

32:50.200 --> 32:52.440
<c.color008000>I put it all in.</font>

32:59.120 --> 33:02.680
<font color="cyan">Oh, my God.</font>
<font color="cyan">It was like soft porn, almost!</font>

33:07.800 --> 33:12.439
<font color="yellow">The look that I received the minute</font>
<font color="yellow">he kicked down the door,</font>

33:12.440 --> 33:14.120
<font color="yellow">it was like...</font>

33:16.960 --> 33:20.760
<font color="yellow">He went full on. He went full on!</font>

33:27.560 --> 33:29.600
<c.color008000>Wow. That was special.</font>

33:35.720 --> 33:40.560
<c.color008000>It was so, so good.</font>

33:45.040 --> 33:49.040
<font color="yellow">I don't think I have ever seen moves</font>
<font color="yellow">quite like his.</font>

34:00.160 --> 34:01.920
<c.color008000>The kiss at the end, what a treat.</font>

34:04.600 --> 34:07.239
<font color="yellow">I didn't even know</font>
<font color="yellow">that was possible.</font>

34:07.240 --> 34:10.559
<font color="yellow">Erm... yeah.</font>

34:10.560 --> 34:12.239
<font color="yellow">Speechless.</font>

34:14.960 --> 34:16.518
The sexy rescue is over,

34:16.520 --> 34:19.360
but who got the girls the hottest
under the collar?

34:20.719 --> 34:23.359
<font color="cyan">Boys, after a lot of deliberation,</font>

34:23.360 --> 34:27.880
<font color="cyan">the girls have decided the boy</font>
<font color="cyan">with the hottest stuff is...</font>

34:30.920 --> 34:32.599
<font color="cyan">Idris!</font>

34:32.600 --> 34:34.360
(CHEERING)

34:42.040 --> 34:44.518
It's been a baptism of fire
for Alexandra,

34:44.520 --> 34:46.239
she's barely been
in there a day

34:46.239 --> 34:49.679
and she's already had three semi
naked firemen handing her a toy cat

34:49.679 --> 34:51.359
and snogging her face off.

34:51.360 --> 34:53.279
So what's she making of it?

34:53.280 --> 34:56.199
<font color="yellow">I don't even know how I feel right</font>
<font color="yellow">now. </font><font color="cyan"> Three kisses in one go.</font>

34:56.199 --> 35:01.559
<font color="yellow">Bless Alex, he pulled it out the bag</font>
<font color="yellow">and held it together.</font>

35:01.560 --> 35:03.599
<font color="cyan">Was the kiss nice?</font>

35:03.600 --> 35:07.279
<font color="yellow">It was, I could tell he was nervous.</font>

35:07.280 --> 35:09.799
<font color="yellow">And fucking hell, Idris.</font>

35:09.800 --> 35:14.159
<c.color008000>He is almost too good to be real.</font>

35:14.160 --> 35:17.960
<font color="yellow">It is such a tough position now.</font>

35:21.000 --> 35:24.079
Hearing people describe kisses gives
me the heebie-jeebies,

35:24.080 --> 35:27.199
so I've come up with a sure-fire
method to nip it in the bud.

35:27.200 --> 35:32.879
<font color="yellow">How was your kiss with Alexandra?</font>
<font color="cyan">It was nice.</font>

35:32.880 --> 35:34.840
<font color="yellow">I have got a text!</font>

35:36.480 --> 35:38.400
<c.color008000>What is it?</font>

35:54.320 --> 35:58.799
<c.color008000>Whoa!</font>
<font color="yellow">Taxi for two? That is brutal.</font>

35:58.800 --> 36:02.999
<font color="cyan">This is nasty, cut-throat.</font>

36:03.000 --> 36:06.279
<font color="yellow">I have got a really big decision</font>
<font color="yellow">to make.</font>

36:06.280 --> 36:10.879
<font color="yellow">Two of the guys I thought were quite</font>
<font color="yellow">quiet have come out</font>

36:10.880 --> 36:12.439
<font color="yellow">and shown so much personality.</font>

36:12.440 --> 36:15.719
<font color="yellow">So my mind was definitely boggled.</font>

36:15.720 --> 36:17.800
<font color="cyan">You have to get grafting after this.</font>

36:18.920 --> 36:28.639
<c.color008000>Alex, you will be fine.</font>
<c.color008000>We have got project... Alexandra!</font>

36:28.640 --> 36:34.159
<font color="cyan">This is crazy, it is literally</font>
<font color="cyan">either she picks me or I go home.</font>

36:34.160 --> 36:37.359
<font color="cyan">There might not be an Alex tomorrow.</font>

36:37.360 --> 36:42.879
<font color="cyan">But otherwise there could be two.</font>

36:42.880 --> 36:48.359
<font color="cyan">Shit, I need to pull out the best</font>
<font color="cyan">outfit. This is D-Day for me.</font>

36:48.360 --> 36:51.400
<font color="cyan">Do or die, do or get dumped.</font>

36:54.600 --> 36:56.360
The graft is on.

37:08.480 --> 37:11.319
With a dumping looming
Alexandra holds the key

37:11.320 --> 37:14.479
to Alex, Idris and Kieran's Love
Island survival.

37:14.480 --> 37:18.479
Alexandra, prepare to be hit
by a three man Graft-nado.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.359
Starting with Idris.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.079
<font color="yellow">Tough decision.</font>

37:22.080 --> 37:25.239
<font color="cyan">I would hate to be you at</font>
<font color="cyan">this moment.</font>

37:25.240 --> 37:27.439
<font color="cyan">It is really hard.</font>

37:27.440 --> 37:30.799
<font color="yellow">What I am trying to do is weigh</font>
<font color="yellow">up everybody's qualities.</font>

37:30.800 --> 37:35.999
<font color="yellow">Things that I love about all of you</font>
<font color="yellow">and base my decision on that.</font>

37:36.000 --> 37:40.199
<font color="cyan">As soon as you walk through the door</font>
<font color="cyan">it was like, wow.</font>

37:40.200 --> 37:46.559
<font color="cyan">You know what I mean? I was shocked!</font>

37:46.560 --> 37:51.159
<font color="yellow">How are you feeling?</font>
<font color="cyan">I feel all right, to be honest.</font>

37:51.160 --> 37:54.679
<font color="cyan">After that challenge. Wow.</font>

37:54.680 --> 37:58.840
<font color="yellow">Did you enjoy it? </font><font color="cyan"> Yes, the kiss at</font>
<font color="cyan">the end as well.</font>

38:00.000 --> 38:02.639
<font color="yellow">You really killed it today,</font>
<font color="yellow">you raised the bar.</font>

38:02.640 --> 38:13.439
<font color="yellow">But for me that is like... I need</font>
<font color="yellow">to see your personality more.</font>

38:13.440 --> 38:19.719
<font color="cyan">It is quite difficult, to be honest.</font>

38:19.720 --> 38:21.920
<font color="cyan">Hopefully</font>
<font color="cyan">she will pick the right person.</font>

38:29.040 --> 38:34.399
<font color="cyan">Not hopefully, because I am</font>
<font color="cyan">positive, she will pick me.</font>

38:34.400 --> 38:37.999
I have given Alex an earpiece to
coaching through his do or die chat

38:38.000 --> 38:43.639
with Alexandra. Intertwine the
fingers and lean. Lovely stuff.

38:43.640 --> 38:48.199
<font color="yellow">I want you to pick who you have</font>
<font color="yellow">a better connection with.</font>

38:48.200 --> 38:55.079
<font color="yellow">I felt like it was nice</font>
<font color="yellow">to give you a kiss.</font>

38:55.080 --> 38:58.959
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to have another chance</font>
<font color="yellow">to say to you</font>

38:58.960 --> 39:01.679
<font color="yellow">that I do like you and I</font>
<font color="yellow">would like to get to know you more,</font>

39:01.680 --> 39:04.719
<font color="yellow">but at the end of the day I don't</font>
<font color="yellow">want to pressure you</font>

39:04.720 --> 39:07.879
<font color="yellow">and I want you to make the decision</font>
<font color="yellow">that is best for you.</font>

39:07.880 --> 39:10.639
<font color="yellow">That is what I want to say.</font>

39:10.640 --> 39:13.479
<font color="yellow">I really hope tonight she makes the</font>
<font color="yellow">right decision for herself</font>

39:13.480 --> 39:17.919
<font color="yellow">because if she picks someone for the</font>
<font color="yellow">wrong reasons</font>

39:17.920 --> 39:21.479
<font color="yellow">it will just come out eventually</font>
<font color="yellow">and things won't work.</font>

39:21.480 --> 39:24.079
<font color="yellow">I really hope she makes the right</font>
<font color="yellow">decision.</font>

39:24.080 --> 39:27.559
We have explained to Kieran that the
fridge can't pick him,

39:27.560 --> 39:30.599
so he has turned his attention
back to Alexandra.

39:30.600 --> 39:35.759
<font color="yellow">I know you haven't been here</font>
<font color="yellow">for long,</font>

39:35.760 --> 39:39.279
<font color="yellow">but what I do know I really like.</font>

39:39.280 --> 39:42.999
<font color="yellow">It is interesting to see if I can</font>
<font color="yellow">get to know you a lot more.</font>

39:43.000 --> 39:45.599
<font color="yellow">You want to find someone you can</font>
<font color="yellow">have a connection with</font>

39:45.600 --> 39:47.479
<font color="yellow">and at the end of the day</font>

39:47.480 --> 39:49.879
<font color="yellow">we can sit here and persuade you</font>
<font color="yellow">to come our way,</font>

39:49.880 --> 39:52.679
<font color="yellow">but for me I like going</font>
<font color="yellow">about things more subtle.</font>

39:52.680 --> 39:57.519
<font color="cyan">I know because of the way you kissed</font>
<font color="cyan">me, you didn't go full whack.</font>

39:57.520 --> 39:59.560
<font color="yellow">Did you enjoy it?</font>

40:02.840 --> 40:05.679
<font color="cyan">It was nice to have a kiss.</font>

40:05.680 --> 40:13.559
<font color="yellow">I want Alexandra to choose me.</font>
<font color="yellow">I would like to know her a bit more.</font>

40:13.560 --> 40:16.199
<font color="yellow">I would be over the moon if you did</font>
<font color="yellow">choose me,</font>

40:16.200 --> 40:19.439
<font color="yellow">but I want you to choose me because</font>
<font color="yellow">you feel there was something there.</font>

40:19.440 --> 40:24.439
<font color="cyan">Thank you for pulling me to one side</font>
<font color="cyan">and having a chat.</font>

40:24.440 --> 40:27.759
<font color="cyan">Honestly. Honestly!</font>

40:27.760 --> 40:29.959
<font color="cyan">All the boys have called me</font>
<font color="cyan">for a chat</font>

40:29.960 --> 40:33.279
<font color="cyan">and unfortunately for me that is not</font>
<font color="cyan">helping the situation.</font>

40:33.280 --> 40:35.079
<font color="cyan">It will not be an easy decision.</font>

40:35.080 --> 40:37.759
As a boxer this is
a tough situation for Idris.

40:37.760 --> 40:41.919
Normally in a competition with a guy
he will knock them sparko, job done.

40:41.920 --> 40:44.679
So he has turned to the girls.

40:44.680 --> 40:55.159
<c.color008000>How are you feeling?</font>
<font color="yellow">I am quite nervous.</font>

40:55.160 --> 40:56.999
<font color="cyan">Three people is a lot.</font>

40:57.000 --> 41:00.839
<font color="yellow">She only had a day to get to know</font>
<font color="yellow">all three of us.</font>

41:00.840 --> 41:04.039
<c.color008000>She just needs to see who she has a</font>
<c.color008000>better connection with.</font>

41:04.040 --> 41:06.119
<c.color008000>All you can do is be yourself.</font>

41:06.120 --> 41:09.599
<font color="cyan">It is good to be vulnerable</font>
<font color="cyan">and put it out there.</font>

41:09.600 --> 41:11.759
<font color="cyan">You'd want her to make a decision</font>

41:11.760 --> 41:16.159
<font color="cyan">based on knowing you</font>
<font color="cyan">as well as she can.</font>

41:16.160 --> 41:18.640
<font color="yellow">This is my first girly talk!</font>

41:35.320 --> 41:38.039
<font color="yellow">How are you feeling about tonight?</font>

41:38.040 --> 41:40.959
<font color="cyan">Mixed emotions.</font>

41:40.960 --> 41:43.239
<font color="cyan">A bit nervous because I don't know</font>
<font color="cyan">what is going on.</font>

41:43.240 --> 41:49.800
<font color="cyan">A bit nervous because I don't want</font>
<font color="cyan">to go and I do like Alexandra.</font>

41:51.760 --> 41:56.439
<c.color008000>All we care about, you being happy.</font>

41:56.440 --> 41:59.519
<font color="yellow">Everything I would like from a guy,</font>

41:59.520 --> 42:03.239
<font color="yellow">they have all shown me that</font>
<font color="yellow">and they are all so nice.</font>

42:03.240 --> 42:06.200
<font color="yellow">I am starting to get really nervous</font>
<font color="yellow">now.</font>

42:07.360 --> 42:10.119
<font color="cyan">She has been talking to Idris</font>
<font color="cyan">as well as Alex,</font>

42:10.120 --> 42:12.399
<font color="cyan">but at the end of the day</font>
<font color="cyan">I am doing me.</font>

42:12.400 --> 42:16.519
<font color="cyan">If she doesn't like that it is not</font>
<font color="cyan">to be.</font>

42:16.520 --> 42:18.799
<font color="cyan">I don't want to go home early.</font>

42:18.800 --> 42:21.439
<font color="cyan">There might be something</font>
<font color="cyan">there with me and Alexandra,</font>

42:21.440 --> 42:24.440
<font color="cyan">so I am hoping she will choose me</font>
<font color="cyan">and we can give it a go.</font>

42:31.560 --> 42:35.039
<font color="yellow">It is just making my decision really</font>
<font color="yellow">hard because they are also lovely.</font>

42:35.040 --> 42:38.160
<font color="yellow">I don't want to send anybody home.</font>

42:42.560 --> 42:46.079
<font color="cyan">With three different guys, all three</font>
<font color="cyan">of us are completely different.</font>

42:46.080 --> 42:50.920
<font color="cyan">If she picks someone else I will not</font>
<font color="cyan">take that as a personal insult.</font>

42:54.360 --> 42:56.679
<font color="yellow">If Alex was to go tonight,</font>

42:56.680 --> 43:00.280
<font color="yellow">that would be the worst blow I have</font>
<font color="yellow">had in here about anybody leaving.</font>

43:03.080 --> 43:07.479
{\an1}<font color="yellow">This is it now. It is out of his</font>
<font color="yellow">control. That is a scary thought.</font>

43:07.480 --> 43:13.240
<font color="cyan">My head is like...</font>
<font color="cyan">I am just struggling.</font>

43:16.880 --> 43:19.399
<c.color008000>It looks desperate.</font>

43:19.400 --> 43:21.599
<font color="yellow">I have said what I need to say.</font>

43:21.600 --> 43:24.919
<font color="yellow">Tonight is a roll of the dice.</font>

43:24.920 --> 43:28.319
<font color="yellow">I met someone I really</font>
<font color="yellow">like and I get on with really well.</font>

43:28.320 --> 43:31.639
<font color="yellow">I am obviously hoping she picks me.</font>
<font color="yellow">She is such a great girl.</font>

43:31.640 --> 43:34.839
<font color="cyan">Mate, she is stunning.</font>

43:34.840 --> 43:38.319
<c.color008000>I want to get to know</font>
<c.color008000>more about you.</font>

43:38.320 --> 43:42.919
<c.color008000>I think it is quite intense.</font>

43:42.920 --> 43:49.639
<c.color008000>I am being myself,</font>
<c.color008000>being funny when I can be funny.</font>

43:49.640 --> 43:51.640
<c.color008000>(MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY)</font>

44:05.440 --> 44:09.919
<c.color008000>There is only one game, I am</font>
<c.color008000>confident Alexandra will pick me.</font>

<font color="yellow">needs to be a man,</font>

44:23.720 --> 44:25.839
<font color="yellow">and physically he is that,</font>

44:25.840 --> 44:28.800
<font color="yellow">but my strongest communication</font>
<font color="yellow">would be with Alex.</font>

44:32.480 --> 44:34.800
<font color="yellow">I am in two minds.</font>

44:39.200 --> 44:41.399
<font color="yellow">It is so... I feel really emotional</font>

44:41.400 --> 44:47.399
<font color="yellow">because I feel like I have only had</font>
<font color="yellow">half a day to get to know them.</font>

44:47.400 --> 44:49.960
<font color="cyan">You look nice.</font>
<font color="yellow">Thank you very much.</font>

44:51.200 --> 44:56.319
<font color="yellow">Everything moves so fast. I have got</font>
<font color="yellow">to grab the bull by the horns.</font>

44:56.320 --> 45:01.919
<font color="cyan">There are a lot of qualities</font>
<font color="cyan">I like about you.</font>

45:01.920 --> 45:04.719
<font color="cyan">You have made me like you even more.</font>

45:04.720 --> 45:10.279
<font color="cyan">You want someone who respects</font>
<font color="cyan">you and understands you.</font>

45:13.440 --> 45:16.519
<font color="cyan">where she feels like she has a</font>
<font color="cyan">connection with someone.</font>

45:16.520 --> 45:20.279
<font color="cyan">I am nervous</font>
<font color="cyan">but I have to roll with it.</font>

45:20.280 --> 45:23.039
<font color="yellow">I don't even think it is about</font>

<font color="yellow">that is what I am going for.</font>

45:31.440 --> 45:34.279
