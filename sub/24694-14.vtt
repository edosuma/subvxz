00:38.434 --> 00:40.868
- TOLD YOU.
SHE'S LIKE CLOCKWORK.

00:44.801 --> 00:45.868
- THE USUAL?

00:45.868 --> 00:47.367
- THOUGHT YOU WERE OUT OF HERE.

00:47.367 --> 00:48.801
- YEAH, AFTER TONIGHT.

00:48.801 --> 00:50.200
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

00:50.200 --> 00:52.167
- OH, QUIT GETTING HIGH.

00:52.167 --> 00:53.634
STUDY HARD, GO TO HARVARD.

00:53.634 --> 00:56.667
- I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.234

01:02.434 --> 01:04.934

01:04.934 --> 01:07.033

THEY'RE MATCHBOXES.

01:07.033 --> 01:08.901
- YEAH, OF INDIAN HAY WITH
A SWISHER FOR YOUR BOYFRIEND.

01:08.901 --> 01:11.033
- I'LL PAY YOU TOMORROW.
I DON'T HAVE IT NOW.

01:11.033 --> 01:12.667
- I'M LEAVING TOMORROW.

01:12.667 --> 01:15.000
- TOMORROW MORNING.
10:00.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.534
SAME PLACE WE MET LAST TIME.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.868
- FINE.
I'LL TAKE THIS TILL THEN.

01:17.868 --> 01:19.834
- I NEED THAT.
- AND I NEED $200.

01:19.834 --> 01:22.000
AND IF YOU FLAKE,
I'LL CALL YOUR HOUSE.

01:33.534 --> 01:35.100
- LISTEN, JUSTIN.

01:35.100 --> 01:37.133
THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO TELL YOU.

01:37.133 --> 01:39.234
I'M DONE.
- YEAH, RIGHT.

01:39.234 --> 01:40.667
- I MEAN IT.
I'M LEAVING.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.367
- WHAT, THAT FREAKY COMMUNE
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT?

01:43.367 --> 01:44.567
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
MILK GOATS?

01:44.567 --> 01:46.067
- IT'S A FARM.

01:46.067 --> 01:47.467
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE HELL IT IS.

01:47.467 --> 01:49.067
YOU STAY HERE.
YOU'RE MY TOP EARNER.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.133
AND YOU'RE SHORT.

01:51.133 --> 01:52.701
- ONE GIRL STILL OWES.
I'LL GET IT IN THE MORNING.

01:52.701 --> 01:54.968
- ON YOUR WAY
TO THE GOAT HERD?

01:54.968 --> 01:56.667
I DON'T THINK SO. COME ON.
I'M GOING BACK TO THE BAR.

01:56.667 --> 01:58.434
- NO, I'M NOT.

01:58.434 --> 02:00.100
IS THAT RIGHT?

02:00.100 --> 02:01.734
- OH, YOU WANT TO GO?
GOOD LUCK.

02:01.734 --> 02:03.868
I DON'T THINK THE BOUNCER
LETS STREET TRASH INTO THE BAR.

02:03.868 --> 02:05.968
- GET IN THE CAR.

02:05.968 --> 02:07.133
GET IN THE CAR.
- OKAY, OKAY.

02:07.133 --> 02:10.234
- [groans]
YOU STUPID BITCH!

02:10.234 --> 02:11.701
COME HERE!

02:11.701 --> 02:14.868
I'M GONNA KILL YOU.
COME HERE!

02:18.434 --> 02:21.133
- GRACE.
COME ON, COME ON.

02:21.133 --> 02:22.501
COME ON.

02:26.801 --> 02:30.534
- [panting]
THANKS.

02:30.534 --> 02:33.968
- GRACE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:33.968 --> 02:36.601
- NOTHING.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.667
- HE'S STILL OUTSIDE.

02:41.667 --> 02:44.334
- OH, MAYBE I BETTER HANG
FOR A FEW MINUTES, YEAH?

02:44.334 --> 02:46.834
- WHAT--
YOU'RE BLEEDING.

02:48.834 --> 02:51.567
THERE'S ANTISEPTIC
IN THE BATHROOM.

02:55.434 --> 02:58.501
- DAMN, I AM BLEEDING.

02:58.501 --> 03:00.767
[sighs]
OH, GOD.

03:10.968 --> 03:12.367
HEY, YOU THINK
I COULD TAKE A SHOWER?

03:12.367 --> 03:15.934
MY APARTMENT HASN'T HAD
HOT WATER FOR A WEEK.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.701
- [chuckles]
SURE.

03:18.701 --> 03:19.834
- THANKS.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.167
[water running]

03:58.767 --> 04:01.300
WOW, I FEEL
ALMOST HUMAN AGAIN.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.701
- [nervous chuckle]

04:04.701 --> 04:06.601
HE'S GONE.

04:06.601 --> 04:08.067
- IS THIS ALL
YOUR MOM'S STUFF?

04:12.400 --> 04:14.200
GOD.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.132
I'M SORRY SHE DIED, HENRY.

04:16.132 --> 04:17.834
SHE WAS A NICE LADY.

04:17.834 --> 04:19.701
- SHE WAS.

04:25.501 --> 04:27.868
IF YOU'RE IN
SOME KIND OF TROUBLE--

04:27.868 --> 04:29.434
- NO, HE'S JUST MAD
'CAUSE I'M LEAVING.

04:31.334 --> 04:33.200
- LEAVING?

04:33.200 --> 04:34.400
- YEAH, TO VERMONT.

04:34.400 --> 04:37.567
YOU KNOW, UH,
MY COUSIN HAS A FARM THERE.

04:37.567 --> 04:39.133
MY LIFE HERE...

04:41.534 --> 04:43.767
I JUST WANT TO GET RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

04:43.767 --> 04:47.067
- OF COURSE.

04:47.067 --> 04:48.968
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

04:48.968 --> 04:51.901
- [laughs]
I DON'T KNOW.

04:51.901 --> 04:54.901
- GOD, I'LL MISS YOUR MOM.

04:54.901 --> 04:57.434
WHEN YOU USED TO COME OVER
AND VISIT HER,

04:57.434 --> 05:00.567
IT WAS FUN TALKING TO YOU.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.200
AND ALL THOSE
ICE CREAM CONES?

05:02.200 --> 05:04.133
- [exhales]

05:04.133 --> 05:06.834
- THANK YOU.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.534
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:16.534 --> 05:19.501
- YOU KISSED ME.

05:19.501 --> 05:21.067
- NOT--I GOTTA GO.

05:21.067 --> 05:23.167
- NO, NO, NO.
NOT YET.

05:23.167 --> 05:26.033
[chuckling]
I'M--LOOK--

05:26.033 --> 05:27.400
WE--WE CAN TALK.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.567
HUH?
I MEAN, UH, WE--

05:30.567 --> 05:32.467
WE CAN TALK.
HERE.

05:32.467 --> 05:33.868
- OH, NO.
LATER, LATER.

05:33.868 --> 05:35.834
LATER.
I'LL--I'LL COME BACK.

05:35.834 --> 05:38.133
- NO, GRACE, GRACE.
JUST LET ME--

05:38.133 --> 05:39.434
- NO, STOP IT!

05:39.434 --> 05:40.934
WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF PERVERT?

05:40.934 --> 05:42.734
- NO! DON'T.

05:42.734 --> 05:44.234
- AND ALL THOSE TIMES
YOU WERE JUST BEING FRIENDLY?

05:44.234 --> 05:45.934
- I WAS.
I AM.

05:45.934 --> 05:47.467
- THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOU.

05:47.467 --> 05:48.801
- NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

05:48.801 --> 05:50.300
- NO, HELP.
- NO.

05:50.300 --> 05:53.300
- HEY, HEY!
HELP ME IN HERE!

05:53.300 --> 05:55.634
[muffled shouting]

05:55.634 --> 05:59.167
GET OFF ME!
PERVERT!

05:59.167 --> 06:01.067
[grunting]

06:01.067 --> 06:02.133
DAMN PERVERT.

06:02.133 --> 06:05.300
- OH, GOD.
- DAMN PERVERT!

06:05.300 --> 06:07.634
- NO, NO.
- YOU CAN'T--

06:07.634 --> 06:08.934
GET--
- NO, NO.

06:08.934 --> 06:11.400
- [screaming]
- [grunting]

07:02.100 --> 07:03.267
- GARBAGE TRUCK DRIVER
SPOTTED HER

07:03.267 --> 07:04.334
BEFORE HE DUMPED THE LOAD.

07:04.334 --> 07:06.667
ASSISTANT M.E.
PUT THE TIME OF DEATH

07:06.667 --> 07:08.501
BETWEEN MIDNIGHT
AND 4:00 A.M.

07:08.501 --> 07:10.133
FOUND A WALLET IN HER POCKET.

07:10.133 --> 07:12.067
I.D. FROM A FANCY PREP SCHOOL.

07:12.067 --> 07:14.434
HOME ADDRESS
ON FIFTH AVENUE.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.000
- SO HERE I AM,
MAJOR CASE?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.801
- SHE'S DEAD JUST THE SAME
AS ANYONE ELSE, ISN'T SHE?

07:19.801 --> 07:22.367
- [sighs]
YES, SHE IS.

07:22.367 --> 07:24.334
[sniffing]

07:24.334 --> 07:27.200
- SORRY.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.234
- FOR WHAT?
- I'M LATE.

07:29.234 --> 07:30.567
- IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

07:30.567 --> 07:32.434
- WHAT IS?

07:32.434 --> 07:34.367
- NOTHING.

07:34.367 --> 07:35.934
- YEAH, BEING PREGNANT
IS NOT AN EXCUSE.

07:35.934 --> 07:37.267
- NO, NO.
OF COURSE NOT.

07:37.267 --> 07:39.167
YOU'RE LATE,
AND IT'S NOT UNDERSTANDABLE.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.367
- THAT'S CORRECT.

07:40.367 --> 07:41.934
- SO WITHOUT CALLING
FURTHER ATTENTION

07:41.934 --> 07:44.868
TO THIS, UH, OFFENSIVE
YET, UH,

07:44.868 --> 07:46.734
HIGHLY UNCHARACTERISTIC
BREACH OF DISCIPLINE,

07:46.734 --> 07:48.901
UH, TAKE A LOOK
AT CECI MADISON.

07:48.901 --> 07:51.267
- OOH, SOMEONE WAS ANGRY.

07:51.267 --> 07:53.400
- YEAH, BUT NOT SO ANGRY
THAT THEY FORGOT TO CLEAN UP.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.434
SMELL.

07:55.434 --> 07:56.667
- SMELL?

07:56.667 --> 07:59.267
- YEAH, TELL ME IF YOU SMELL
WHAT I DO.

07:59.267 --> 08:02.100
- [sniffing]

08:02.100 --> 08:04.434
MM...EGG FOO YOUNG.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.033
WET NYLON.

08:07.033 --> 08:08.334
DOG CRAP.

08:08.334 --> 08:10.567
BLEACH.

08:10.567 --> 08:11.801
THE KILLER BLEACHED THE BODY.

08:11.801 --> 08:13.601
- THAT'S JUST WHAT I THOUGHT.

08:13.601 --> 08:16.234
- EXCUSE ME.

08:16.234 --> 08:20.868
[retching]

08:20.868 --> 08:23.234
- IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

08:23.234 --> 08:25.100
- THAT'S AWFUL.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.801
A GIRL IN A DUMPSTER.

08:26.801 --> 08:28.067
- YEAH, WITH YOUR WALLET.

08:28.067 --> 08:29.834
WE THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.

08:29.834 --> 08:32.767
- BUT I'M ALL RIGHT.
I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE.

08:32.767 --> 08:34.933
BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR CHECKING.

08:34.933 --> 08:37.801
- YEAH, DON'T YOU WANT
YOUR CREDIT CARDS BACK, THOUGH?

08:37.801 --> 08:39.567
- SURE, DO--
DO YOU HAVE THEM?

08:39.567 --> 08:41.033
- WHO IS IT, DEAR?

08:41.033 --> 08:42.567
- UH, CAN I CALL YOU LATER?

08:42.567 --> 08:44.000
GIVE ME YOUR CARD
OR SOMETHING?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.834
- ACTUALLY, UH,
WE'D LIKE YOUR HELP

08:45.834 --> 08:47.267
FIGURING OUT
WHO THE DEAD GIRL IS.

08:47.267 --> 08:48.534
- HOW--HOW WOULD I KNOW?

08:48.534 --> 08:50.801
- HOW WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:50.801 --> 08:53.133
- SOMEBODY STOLE MY WALLET.
AT THE LIBRARY.

08:53.133 --> 08:56.100
- WHEN?
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.701
- WE FOUND YOUR DAUGHTER'S
WALLET IN THE POCKET

08:57.701 --> 08:59.801
OF A DEAD GIRL
IN A DUMPSTER DOWNTOWN.

08:59.801 --> 09:01.834
- CECI, I THOUGHT
WE WERE DONE WITH THIS.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.200
- DONE WITH WHAT?
- DOPE.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.334
- [scoffing]
MOM, IT'S JUST POT.

09:06.334 --> 09:07.801
- THE GIRL WITH YOUR WALLET?

09:07.801 --> 09:10.534
- [sighs]

09:10.534 --> 09:12.033
HER NAME WAS GRACE, OKAY?

09:12.033 --> 09:16.334
AND SHE DEALT.
AT MCTEAL'S.

09:16.334 --> 09:18.501
- IF SHE WAS A DEALER,
SHE MAY BE IN THE SYSTEM.

09:18.501 --> 09:20.667
- WELL, I HAVEN'T GOT
MUCH MORE FOR YOU.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.000
C.O.D. WAS BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.267
- HMM.
IT'S PERSONAL.

09:25.267 --> 09:26.734
- VERY. HERE.

09:26.734 --> 09:30.000
SINGLE POSTMORTEM INCISION
MADE WITH A JAGGED EDGE BLADE.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.434
- HUH.

09:31.434 --> 09:35.000
THE KILLER'S FIRST THOUGHT
WAS TO CUT HER IN PIECES

09:35.000 --> 09:37.300
AND DISPOSE OF THE BODY.

09:37.300 --> 09:40.334
HE WAS, UH, ANGRY ENOUGH
TO BEAT HER TO DEATH,

09:40.334 --> 09:42.400
BUT NOT SO ANGRY
HE COULD CUT HER UP.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.133
- AND WHAT ABOUT THE BLEACH?

09:44.133 --> 09:47.200
- KILLER GAVE HER A FULL BATH,
INSIDE AND OUT.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.667
AND HE WASHED HER CLOTHES.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.601
AND TOSSED HER IN A DUMPSTER,

09:50.601 --> 09:53.634
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE ISSUES
WITH CROSS-CONTAMINATION.

09:53.634 --> 09:57.167
- UH, AT LEAST WE CAN FIND OUT
WHO SHE WAS.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.767
- THE PRINTS CAME BACK
AS GRACE PUREFOY.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.834
SHE LIVED TWO BLOCKS
FROM WHERE HER BODY WAS FOUND.

10:03.834 --> 10:07.167
SHE SOLD DRUGS
AT PRIVATE SCHOOLS UPTOWN.

10:07.167 --> 10:08.501
- TWO JUVIES FOR POSSESSION.

10:08.501 --> 10:10.334
LOOKS LIKE SHE HAD
A PROMISING CAREER

10:10.334 --> 10:11.667
AS A SUBSTANCE ABUSER.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.334
SHE KICKS
TO THE NINTH PRECINCT.

10:14.334 --> 10:16.000
- UM...

10:16.000 --> 10:18.634
CECI MADISON IS A, UH,
MAJOR CASE,

10:18.634 --> 10:19.901
BUT GRACE PUREFOY IS NOT.

10:19.901 --> 10:22.901
- THAT IS CORRECT.
YOU BEG TO DIFFER?

10:22.901 --> 10:25.100
- WELL, I COULD SAY THAT THIS
IS NOT JUST ANOTHER MURDER.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.501
BUT THAT WOULD IMPLY
THAT THERE IS SUCH A THING

10:27.501 --> 10:28.667
AS JUST ANOTHER MURDER,

10:28.667 --> 10:29.968
WHICH IS A TERRIBLE THING
TO SAY,

10:29.968 --> 10:31.133
SINCE "JUST" AND "MURDER"

10:31.133 --> 10:32.501
SHOULD NEVER BE USED
IN THE SAME SENTENCE.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.133
- WELL, FOLLOWING THAT LOGIC,

10:34.133 --> 10:35.501
THEN EVERY CASE
IS A MAJOR CASE.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.234
- YES.

10:37.234 --> 10:38.901
- WHICH IS WHY
YOU ARE NOT IN CHARGE.

10:38.901 --> 10:41.067
WE ARE NOT
THE LOW-LEVEL DRUG DEALER

10:41.067 --> 10:42.767
FROM THE EAST VILLAGE
CASE SQUAD.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.567
WE'RE CALLED MAJOR CASE
FOR GOOD REASON.

10:44.567 --> 10:48.133
- YEAH, WELL, WHAT IF THE, UH,
VICTIM DOESN'T GIVE US A REASON

10:48.133 --> 10:49.534
BUT THE KILLER DOES?

10:49.534 --> 10:52.667
- BECAUSE HE KNEW TO USE BLEACH
AND TOSS HER IN A DUMPSTER?

10:52.667 --> 10:55.567
- THAT'S NOT RUN-OF-THE-MILL.
COULD BE PRETTY...MAJOR.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.601
- OR HE WATCHES
TOO MUCH <i>CSI.</i>

10:57.601 --> 11:00.367
48 HOURS, THEN GRACE PUREFOY
KICKS BACK TO THE NINTH.

11:00.367 --> 11:04.801
- UH, UM, UH, GOREN CALLED
FROM TENNESSEE, CAPTAIN.

11:04.801 --> 11:06.334
HE NEEDS YOU
TO CALL THAT SHERIFF.

11:10.701 --> 11:12.634
WHAT HOSPITAL?
- ST. VINCENT'S.

11:12.634 --> 11:15.067
- YOU HAVE A BAG PACKED?
- IT'S IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

11:15.067 --> 11:17.234
- OKAY.
DETECTIVES.

11:20.133 --> 11:23.067
[scrubbing]

11:30.501 --> 11:32.767
[breathing heavily]

12:12.467 --> 12:14.334
- HOW IS SHE?

12:14.334 --> 12:17.000
- SHE'S IN LABOR.
HER SISTER'S WITH HER.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
IN BETWEEN SCREAMS,
SHE TOLD ME

12:19.000 --> 12:20.868
YOU FOUGHT TO KEEP THIS CASE.

12:20.868 --> 12:23.133
- YEAH. HMM.
WHAT ELSE DID SHE TELL YOU?

12:23.133 --> 12:25.567
- THAT YOU REQUIRE
ADULT SUPERVISION.

12:25.567 --> 12:26.767
AFTER YOU.

12:29.834 --> 12:34.133
- MY BABY.
MY LITTLE GIRL.

12:34.133 --> 12:37.200
- WE'RE SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS,
MRS. PUREFOY.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.300
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE GRACE
WAS LAST NIGHT?

12:39.300 --> 12:43.534
- SHE JUST WENT OUT.

12:43.534 --> 12:46.534
- DO YOU KNOW
WHO SHE WAS WITH?

12:48.701 --> 12:52.000
- SHE HAD A FRIEND.
UH, PAJ OR SOMETHING.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
- PAJ.
WAS HE INDIAN?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.734
- UH...
- DO YOU HAVE A LAST NAME?

12:56.734 --> 12:59.701
- NO.
- MAYBE A PHONE NUMBER?

12:59.701 --> 13:02.000
- NO. NO.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.901
NO.
- THIS WAS GRACE'S ROOM.

13:03.901 --> 13:07.434
- YEAH. MY BABY.

13:07.434 --> 13:08.868
- WHO'S THAT?

13:08.868 --> 13:10.033
- COUSIN.

13:10.033 --> 13:12.667
- OH.
BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.400
- GRACE WENT THERE LAST YEAR.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.501
SHE COULDN'T STOP TALKING
ABOUT IT.

13:16.501 --> 13:17.634
- HMM.

13:17.634 --> 13:19.067
THERE'S A BUS TICKET.

13:19.067 --> 13:20.801
NEW YORK TO MONTPELIER.

13:20.801 --> 13:23.300
[knock at door]
- IT'S OPEN.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.300
- IT'S ME.
CAME AS SOON AS I COULD.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.901
YOU OKAY?
- [sobbing]

13:26.901 --> 13:28.067
- OH, YOU GUYS COPS?

13:28.067 --> 13:30.567
- WE'RE DETECTIVES EAMES
AND NICHOLS.

13:30.567 --> 13:32.334
AND YOU ARE?
- NATE.

13:32.334 --> 13:33.968
HENRICK.

13:33.968 --> 13:35.033
- NATE'S MY FRIEND.

13:35.033 --> 13:38.767
- UH, I CAN SEE THAT.
GOOD FRIEND.

13:38.767 --> 13:40.934
- MAYBE IF WE CAME BACK LATER,

13:40.934 --> 13:42.133
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE
TO REMEMBER MORE.

13:42.133 --> 13:44.267
- I'M FINE.

13:44.267 --> 13:45.467
I WON'T BE ANY DIFFERENT LATER.

13:45.467 --> 13:46.868
- YOU MIGHT BE SOBER.

13:50.767 --> 13:54.300
- MY BABY GIRL
WAS JUST KILLED.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.100
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

13:57.100 --> 13:59.601
- SHE WAS DRUNK NOW
BECAUSE, UH, GRACE WAS DEAD.

13:59.601 --> 14:01.367
SHE WAS DRUNK YESTERDAY
'CAUSE SHE WASN'T.

14:01.367 --> 14:02.834
- OR BECAUSE IT WAS TUESDAY.

14:02.834 --> 14:06.167
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO KICK THIS TO THE NINTH?

14:06.167 --> 14:08.634
- UH, GRACE KEPT THIS
ON HER PILLOW

14:08.634 --> 14:09.834
LIKE IT WAS A DREAM,

14:09.834 --> 14:11.701
SOME PLACE TO GET AWAY
FROM ALL THIS.

14:11.701 --> 14:14.501
- I HEARD YOU GOT AWAY
FOR A FEW YEARS.

14:14.501 --> 14:16.501
YOU FEELING
SOME KIND OF KINDRED SPIRIT?

14:16.501 --> 14:21.167
- UH, I TRY TO AVOID
TRANSFERENTIAL RELATIONSHIPS

14:21.167 --> 14:22.367
WITH DEAD PEOPLE.

14:22.367 --> 14:24.667
IT'S ALWAYS SO ONE-SIDED.

14:24.667 --> 14:25.701
- SO WHAT IS IT?

14:27.234 --> 14:30.734
- THAT MOTHER...
CECI MADISON...

14:30.734 --> 14:34.234
THE BLEACH, VERMONT.

14:34.234 --> 14:37.200
IT ALL FEELS SO UNCONNECTED.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.601
- WHAT'S NEXT?

14:39.601 --> 14:41.734
- BEFORE I LEFT, THIS GUY
WAS THE GO-TO CRIMINALIST

14:41.734 --> 14:43.801
FOR UNSOLVED CASES
INVOLVING MINORS.

14:43.801 --> 14:45.400
ALL THE KIDS THAT MIGHT'VE
FALLEN THROUGH THE CRACKS.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.367
- LIKE GRACE PUREFOY.
- YEAH, ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.167
TOTAL FOLLOW-THROUGH.
HE LIVED FOR THE WORK.

14:49.167 --> 14:50.300
- WELL, PEOPLE NOTICED.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.801
THEY MADE HIM
THE HEAD OF THE LAB.

14:51.801 --> 14:54.067
- WELL, I'M STILL SURE
HE'LL HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.133
UH, IT WAS HIS PASSION.

14:55.133 --> 14:56.400
- HE WROTE A BOOK.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.234
HE'S A TV TALKING HEAD NOW.

14:58.234 --> 14:59.868
- OH, GOOD FOR HIM.
HE DESERVES IT.

14:59.868 --> 15:01.667
BEST LAB GUY I EVER MET.
HELLO.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.367
- COME IN.

15:06.067 --> 15:07.133
HENRY.

15:13.467 --> 15:15.767
- THIS IS VERY,
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

15:15.767 --> 15:17.400
- THEY'RE JUST OLD CASES.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.701
- OH, DON'T BE MODEST.
RIGHT HERE.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.234
THE MCLANAHAN GIRL.
- YEAH.

15:22.234 --> 15:24.067
- YOU PULLED DNA
OFF OF A SHOVEL

15:24.067 --> 15:25.667
THAT HAD BEEN IN THE OCEAN
FOR A WEEK.

15:25.667 --> 15:28.367
- I JUST HOPE THE BOOK
HELPS PEOPLE APPRECIATE

15:28.367 --> 15:30.167
THE ROLE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE.

15:30.167 --> 15:33.234
- HERE, MAYBE THIS, UH, CASE
CAN BE IN YOUR NEXT BOOK.

15:33.234 --> 15:36.901
- [chuckles]

15:36.901 --> 15:39.400
- THE BODY WAS BLEACHED
AND DUMPED IN THE GARBAGE.

15:39.400 --> 15:42.767
THE M.E. SENT TISSUE SAMPLES
AND HER CLOTHES.

15:42.767 --> 15:46.701
- THEN I'M SURE WE'RE DEALING
WITH IT, BUT...

15:46.701 --> 15:48.067
I WOULDN'T BE OPTIMISTIC.

15:48.067 --> 15:49.300
- HEY, YOU WEREN'T OPTIMISTIC

15:49.300 --> 15:51.701
ABOUT SUZANNE MARCH EITHER,
WERE YOU?

15:51.701 --> 15:53.868
NOBODY WAS.
BUT, UM...

15:53.868 --> 15:56.234
YOU IDENTIFIED THE TOOL MARKS.

15:56.234 --> 15:59.701
- THAT WAS BACK
WHEN I HAD A BUDGET, DETECTIVE.

15:59.701 --> 16:01.934
IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD,
THINGS ARE A LITTLE BIT TIGHT.

16:01.934 --> 16:03.601
- I KNOW YOU, HENRY.

16:03.601 --> 16:05.968
THIS IS WHAT YOU LIVE FOR.
THIS IS WHO YOU ARE.

16:05.968 --> 16:08.167
- [exhales]

16:08.167 --> 16:11.267
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO, HMM?

16:11.267 --> 16:12.701
- LAST TIME I TALKED
TO HENRY MULLER,

16:12.701 --> 16:14.501
HE TOLD ME HE WAS TOO BUSY
TO TALK TO ME.

16:14.501 --> 16:17.234
- OH, WELL, I-I BEGGED.
IN A PROFESSIONAL WAY.

16:17.234 --> 16:18.567
HE'S--HE'S TAKING A LOOK.
YOU KNOW.

16:18.567 --> 16:20.534
- WE MAY HAVE TO UPGRADE
GRACE'S MOTHER

16:20.534 --> 16:23.100
FROM TOTALLY USELESS
TO FUNCTIONALLY CLUELESS.

16:23.100 --> 16:25.267
- YOU FOUND PAJ?
- IN THE ALIAS REGISTRY.

16:25.267 --> 16:27.501
THERE'S A DRUG DEALER
WITH PRIORS

16:27.501 --> 16:29.934
WHO'S OUT ON BAIL
FOR AN ASSAULT CASE.

16:29.934 --> 16:32.534
- JUSTIN LENNOX,
WHO SELLS UPTOWN.

16:32.534 --> 16:33.767
"PARK AVENUE JUSTIN."

16:33.767 --> 16:35.601
- P-A-J.
PAJ.

16:35.601 --> 16:39.267
- LOOKS LIKE YOU MIGHT MAKE
YOUR 48 HOURS.

16:39.267 --> 16:42.834
- NEVER HEARD OF HER.

16:42.834 --> 16:45.834
- THIS HELP?

16:45.834 --> 16:47.100
- NO CAN DO.

16:47.100 --> 16:49.834
- THIS CONVERSATION
IS GOING SO WELL,

16:49.834 --> 16:51.467
I THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE IT
AT OUR PLACE.

16:51.467 --> 16:53.767
YOU KNOW WHERE THAT IS,
DON'T YOU, JUSTIN?

16:53.767 --> 16:56.100
- I'M OUT ON BAIL, MAN.
THIS IS HARASSMENT.

16:56.100 --> 16:58.634
- I WANT YOU TO TAKE ANOTHER
LOOK AT GRACE'S PHOTO, JUSTIN.

16:58.634 --> 17:00.334
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

17:00.334 --> 17:02.601
- JUST TRY.
HERE, LET ME HELP YOU FOCUS.

17:02.601 --> 17:04.601
- ALL RIGHT.
GET OFF ME.

17:04.601 --> 17:08.166
- IF YOU DID THIS,
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.099
JUST TO MAKE SURE
WE ALL UNDERSTAND.

17:10.099 --> 17:12.567
- I DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO TALK TO YOU.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.067
- AND WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO ON WEEKENDS?

17:15.067 --> 17:16.634
HIRE TEMPS FROM COPS "R" US?

17:16.634 --> 17:18.934
I'M SORRY, CRIMINALS DON'T TAKE
UNPAID FURLOUGHS.

17:18.934 --> 17:22.032
THANK YOU.

17:22.032 --> 17:23.166
HENRY.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.067
- TOUGH TIMES ALL OVER, HUH?

17:25.067 --> 17:26.367
THE RABKIN SHOOTING.

17:26.367 --> 17:28.567
YOUR SUSPECT FILED DOWN
THE GUN BARREL,

17:28.567 --> 17:30.100
BUT WE GOT HIM
ON BULLET BATCHING.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.834
- PERSONAL DELIVERY.
I'M HONORED.

17:31.834 --> 17:34.567
- JUST DON'T TELL NICHOLS.
HE'LL--HE'LL EXPECT THE SAME.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.801
- I HEARD HE PAID YOU A VISIT.

17:36.801 --> 17:38.200
- HE DID.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.334
I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE LETTING HIM
RUN WITH THAT CASE.

17:40.334 --> 17:41.701
- 48 HOURS.

17:41.701 --> 17:43.801
CLOCK'S TICKING.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.234
- HE GOT ANYTHING YET?

17:45.234 --> 17:47.400
- OH, THEY'RE ON ONE GUY,
BUT...

17:47.400 --> 17:48.868
HOW'S IT GOING ON YOUR END?

17:48.868 --> 17:50.567
- I'M WORKING ON IT.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH.

17:50.567 --> 17:52.334
- EXCUSE ME.

18:09.534 --> 18:14.868
[speaking indistinctly]

18:17.701 --> 18:18.801
- HEY THERE.
- HEY.

18:18.801 --> 18:20.234
WHAT'S UP, DR. MULLER?

18:20.234 --> 18:22.334
- I NEED TO REEXAMINE SOMETHING
ON THAT EVIDENCE

18:22.334 --> 18:24.901
ON THE STABBING IN SOHO.

18:24.901 --> 18:27.200
CASE NUMBER RD735.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.367
- YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS?

18:28.367 --> 18:29.667
- NO IDEA.

18:29.667 --> 18:30.934
- ALL THE WAY BACK,
THEN GO RIGHT.

18:30.934 --> 18:33.033
- GOT IT.

18:50.067 --> 18:51.567
- [groans]

20:06.267 --> 20:08.968
- I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.
YOU FOUND SOMETHING?

20:08.968 --> 20:10.834
- I REALLY DIDN'T
HAVE THE TIME,

20:10.834 --> 20:12.601
BUT I STAYED LATE
LAST NIGHT,

20:12.601 --> 20:13.934
AND...YES.

20:13.934 --> 20:15.467
- ONLY YOU, HENRY.

20:15.467 --> 20:18.567
- ONLY BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE
WOULD FALL FOR YOUR SOFT-SOAP.

20:18.567 --> 20:20.634
I GOT A VIABLE TISSUE SAMPLE

20:20.634 --> 20:22.868
FROM UNDER ONE
OF THE GIRL'S FINGERNAILS.

20:22.868 --> 20:24.300
THIS ONE.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.334
AND WE PULLED A MATCH
FROM CODIS.

20:26.334 --> 20:29.133
SOME KID WHO'S OUT ON BAIL
ON AN ASSAULT CHARGE.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.167
NAME OF JUSTIN LENNOX?

20:31.167 --> 20:33.334
THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

20:33.334 --> 20:35.400
- HENRY, YOU'RE A GOD.

20:40.167 --> 20:42.834
- TRUST IS--IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT
PART OF A RELATIONSHIP,

20:42.834 --> 20:44.000
DON'T YOU THINK, JUSTIN?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.267
- WE'VE ALREADY AGREED

20:45.267 --> 20:47.868
THAT MY CLIENT DID, IN FACT,
KNOW GRACE PUREFOY.

20:47.868 --> 20:49.934
- THAT'S NOT WHAT HE TOLD US
WHEN WE MET HIM.

20:49.934 --> 20:51.367
- I FORGOT.

20:51.367 --> 20:53.534
- I SUPPOSE YOU FORGOT
HOW YOUR DNA

20:53.534 --> 20:55.133
GOT UNDERNEATH
HER FINGERNAILS TOO.

20:55.133 --> 20:57.200
- WE HAD AN ARGUMENT.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.767
- AN ARGUMENT.

20:58.767 --> 21:00.901
ABOUT THE DRUGS
SHE WAS SELLING FOR YOU?

21:00.901 --> 21:04.234
- SHE DIDN'T SELL FOR ME.
- JUSTIN.

21:04.234 --> 21:06.367
- I TRIED TO GET HER TO STOP.
THAT'S WHAT THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT.

21:06.367 --> 21:08.434
- HOW NOBLE OF YOU,

21:08.434 --> 21:10.400
TRYING TO SET
THE POOR GIRL STRAIGHT.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.067
- WHY NOT?

21:12.067 --> 21:13.734
SHE WAS A DECENT KID.

21:13.734 --> 21:16.067
- SO TO MAKE HER EVEN MORE
DECENT, YOU ATTACKED HER?

21:16.067 --> 21:17.701
- MORE SHE ATTACKED ME.

21:17.701 --> 21:19.501
SHE WAS KINDA HOT-TEMPERED,
YOU KNOW?

21:19.501 --> 21:22.968
- SHE WAS LEAVING YOU,
JUSTIN.

21:22.968 --> 21:26.634
SHE WAS, UH,
GOING TO VERMONT.

21:26.634 --> 21:29.334
YOU'RE SURE THAT THAT'S NOT
WHAT THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT?

21:29.334 --> 21:31.133
- I WANT TO TALK
TO MY CLIENT.

21:31.133 --> 21:33.100
ALONE.

21:33.100 --> 21:34.767
- THIS GUY'S A MORON.

21:34.767 --> 21:36.067
IT'LL TAKE ABOUT
TEN MORE MINUTES.

21:36.067 --> 21:37.234
I'M CALLING THE D.A.

21:37.234 --> 21:39.200
- DON'T BOTHER.
HE HAS AN ALIBI.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.601
- HE DIDN'T MENTION ONE.

21:40.601 --> 21:42.667
- BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW
HE HAS ONE.

21:42.667 --> 21:44.734
FROM MIDNIGHT UNTIL 4:00
IN THE MORNING, JUSTIN LENNOX

21:44.734 --> 21:47.567
WAS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES
WITH A FELLOW DRUG DEALER.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.267
- OH, SOMEONE NARCOTICS
WAS SITTING ON.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.868
- THEY SAW HIM
ENTER THE BUILDING

21:51.868 --> 21:53.200
AND THEY SAW HIM LEAVE.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.501
- WELL, HE COULD'VE GONE
OUT THE BACK DOOR

21:55.501 --> 21:56.968
AND COME BACK IN?
- RIGHT.

21:56.968 --> 22:00.467
SINCE WHEN IS JUSTIN LENNOX
DR. EVIL,

22:00.467 --> 22:02.167
CRIMINAL MASTERMIND,
EVADING SURVEILLANCE

22:02.167 --> 22:03.234
HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EXISTS?

22:03.234 --> 22:04.667
- GOOD POINT.

22:04.667 --> 22:06.767
- STARTING TOMORROW, EVERYONE
GOES BACK TO WHERE THEY BELONG.

22:06.767 --> 22:09.234
GRACE PUREFOY
GOES TO THE NINTH.

22:09.234 --> 22:10.868
YOU CATCH
THE NEXT MAJOR CASE.

22:25.033 --> 22:28.901
- I WENT OVER HER
FROM HEAD TO TOE AGAIN.

22:28.901 --> 22:30.434
- NO VIABLE FOREIGN DNA.

22:30.434 --> 22:32.767
NOTHING HIDDEN IN A NOOK
OR A CRANNY?

22:32.767 --> 22:34.634
- I DIDN'T JUST BREEZE
THROUGH MY EXAM

22:34.634 --> 22:36.400
THE FIRST TIME, NICHOLS.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.033
BUT TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T KNOW HOW

22:39.033 --> 22:40.801
HENRY GOT THE RESULTS HE DID.

22:40.801 --> 22:42.367
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE GOT
ANY RESULTS.

22:42.367 --> 22:44.167
- BLEACH JOB?
- IT WAS THOROUGH.

22:44.167 --> 22:47.567
EVERY SAMPLE I PULLED
WAS COMPROMISED.

22:47.567 --> 22:50.801
- MM-HMM.

22:50.801 --> 22:52.300
INTERESTING.

22:52.300 --> 22:54.234
- I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO

22:54.234 --> 22:56.100
AN INTERDEPARTMENTAL FIGHT
WITH HENRY MULLER.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.567
WE PLAY BALL WITH HIS PEOPLE,
THEY PLAY BALL WITH US.

22:58.567 --> 23:00.834
- YEAH, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
HENRY'S PLAYING

23:00.834 --> 23:02.801
WITH AN INVISIBLE BALL.

23:02.801 --> 23:04.467
IF THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
ON THE BODY...

23:07.467 --> 23:10.567
- YOU WORK THESE CASES
YEAR AFTER YEAR.

23:10.567 --> 23:12.667
YOU WATCH ONE DIRT BAG
AFTER ANOTHER

23:12.667 --> 23:13.701
GET AWAY WITH MURDER

23:13.701 --> 23:15.234
BECAUSE HE GOT
DUMB LUCKY ENOUGH

23:15.234 --> 23:17.234
NOT TO LEAVE
THE RIGHT TRACE.

23:17.234 --> 23:19.033
- SO WHAT?

23:19.033 --> 23:21.334
HENRY, UH, GOES THE EXTRA MILE
TO GET THE BAD GUYS

23:21.334 --> 23:23.000
AND FINDS EVIDENCE
THAT ISN'T THERE?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.100
- I DON'T KNOW.

23:25.100 --> 23:28.767
MAYBE HE HIT PAY DIRT SOMEHOW,
BUT THE GUY IS...

23:28.767 --> 23:29.834
WRITING BOOKS.

23:29.834 --> 23:31.267
HE'S ON TV.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.367
- MORE INCENTIVE
TO KEEP HIS BATTING AVERAGE UP.

23:38.067 --> 23:41.234
- ARE YOU ASKING YOURSELF
THE SAME QUESTION I AM?

23:41.234 --> 23:42.701
- PROBABLY NOT.

23:42.701 --> 23:44.534
UNLESS YOU'RE ASKING
IF THERE'S EVER BEEN

23:44.534 --> 23:46.367
A SINGLE BLEMISH
ON HENRY MULLER'S RECORD.

23:46.367 --> 23:49.400
A CASE THROWN OUT,
TEST RESULTS QUESTIONED.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.868
- WHY WOULD I BE
ASKING MYSELF THAT?

23:51.868 --> 23:57.334
- 'CAUSE HENRY MIGHT BE, UH,
FUDGING EVIDENCE.

23:57.334 --> 23:59.167
BUT...DEPARTMENTAL COMMENDATION.

23:59.167 --> 24:01.868
MAYOR'S SERVICE AWARD.

24:01.868 --> 24:03.667
UH, HIS MOTHER DIED
LAST MONTH.

24:03.667 --> 24:05.534
LISTEN TO THIS, "SURVIVED
BY HER SON, HENRY MULLER,

24:05.534 --> 24:09.267
THE NOTED FORENSIC SCIENTIST."

24:12.400 --> 24:14.734
"MRS. MULLER
WAS A LIFELONG RESIDENT

24:14.734 --> 24:16.701
OF SEVENTH STREET
ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE."

24:16.701 --> 24:19.033
- GRACE PUREFOY LIVED
ON SEVENTH STREET.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.400
- SAME BLOCK.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.133
- THAT A COINCIDENCE?

24:28.567 --> 24:30.334
- WONDER WHY
HE NEVER MENTIONED THAT.

24:33.767 --> 24:35.167
- YOU HAVE NOW
OFFICIALLY LOST YOUR MIND.

24:35.167 --> 24:37.200
- JUST THINK ABOUT IT LOGICALLY.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.200
- THERE IS NOTHING LOGICAL
ABOUT THE THOUGHT

24:39.200 --> 24:40.434
THAT THE HEAD
OF THE CRIME LAB

24:40.434 --> 24:43.133
MURDERED
A TEENAGE DRUG DEALER.

24:43.133 --> 24:46.701
- HIS MOTHER LIVED ACROSS
THE STREET FROM GRACE PUREFOY,

24:46.701 --> 24:48.100
WHICH HE NEVER MENTIONED.

24:48.100 --> 24:51.968
UH, HE PULLED NONEXISTENT
EVIDENCE OFF OF THE BODY

24:51.968 --> 24:54.400
AND CLAIMED THAT IT BELONGED
TO JUSTIN LENNOX,

24:54.400 --> 24:55.767
WHICH WAS A PERFECT FRAME.

24:55.767 --> 24:57.601
- AND HOW WOULD HE EVEN KNOW

24:57.601 --> 24:58.868
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT JUSTIN LENNOX?

24:58.868 --> 25:00.601
IS HE A MIND READER
AS WELL AS A SCIENTIST?

25:00.601 --> 25:02.434
- NO.

25:02.434 --> 25:06.667
BUT, UM, HE CAN READ.

25:06.667 --> 25:09.834
HE WAS HERE YESTERDAY--
IF I MAY--

25:09.834 --> 25:11.534
IN YOUR OFFICE.

25:11.534 --> 25:12.734
AND HE SAW THIS.

25:12.734 --> 25:14.367
- [exhales]

25:14.367 --> 25:17.100
- BESIDES HENRY MULLER,

25:17.100 --> 25:19.067
AND THE SHOOTER
ON THE GRASSY KNOLL,

25:19.067 --> 25:21.067
ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ANY OTHER SUSPECTS?

25:21.067 --> 25:22.601
- I THINK WE AT LEAST HAVE
TO TAKE A LOOK

25:22.601 --> 25:24.133
AT THE MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND,
NATE.

25:24.133 --> 25:26.934
GRACE WAS IN A BIG HURRY
TO GET OUT OF TOWN.

25:26.934 --> 25:28.934
MAYBE THERE WAS SOMEBODY
IN HER APARTMENT

25:28.934 --> 25:30.634
SHE WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM.

25:30.634 --> 25:34.067
- I KNOW YOU FIND THAT
AWFULLY MUNDANE, NICHOLS,

25:34.067 --> 25:37.968
BUT CHECK IT OUT.

25:37.968 --> 25:40.834
BY THE WAY,
IT'S A GIRL.

25:40.834 --> 25:43.501
- AWW.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.100
- OH.
OH, WE SHOULD, UH--

25:45.100 --> 25:47.334
- YOU SENT ROSES.

25:51.601 --> 25:53.968
- WHERE WAS I
WHEN GRACE WAS KILLED?

25:53.968 --> 25:56.334
- WHERE WERE YOU, HONEY?

25:56.334 --> 25:58.000
- WASN'T I HERE?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.400
- I DON'T KNOW.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.434
- I WAS AT MY PLACE
IF I WASN'T HERE.

26:01.434 --> 26:04.100
- I GOTTA SAY, NATE,
THAT'S A PRETTY LOUSY ALIBI.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.534
- I DON'T NEED AN ALIBI.

26:05.534 --> 26:07.901
I WOULD NEVER HURT GRACE.
I LIKED GRACE.

26:07.901 --> 26:10.133
- HOW MUCH?
- WHA--WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.934
I'M NOT GOING THERE.

26:11.934 --> 26:13.467
- IS THAT WHAT GRACE SAID?

26:13.467 --> 26:17.434
- WHAT--SHE'S SAYING
YOU WAS MESSING WITH GRACE?

26:17.434 --> 26:21.334
NOT IN MY HOUSE, HE WASN'T.
NO WAY.

26:21.334 --> 26:22.834
- YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT?

26:24.467 --> 26:26.167
- WHAT IS IT WITH YOU?

26:26.167 --> 26:27.834
- YOU WOULDN'T MIND IF WE, UH,

26:27.834 --> 26:30.033
JUST TOOK IN A FEW
OF GRACE'S THINGS, WOULD YOU?

26:33.868 --> 26:36.567
- NICE TO SEE YOU
KEEPING AN OPEN MIND.

26:36.567 --> 26:37.701
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:37.701 --> 26:39.667
- I MEAN FORGETTING HENRY
LONG ENOUGH

26:39.667 --> 26:41.934
TO TAKE GRACE'S CLOTHES
AND GET THEM TESTED

26:41.934 --> 26:43.501
TO SEE IF THERE'S
TOO MUCH NATE ON THEM.

26:43.501 --> 26:44.834
- OH.

26:44.834 --> 26:47.100
YEAH, I GUESS
I CAN DO THAT TOO.

26:50.701 --> 26:53.267
YEAH.
UH, IT WAS DISAPPOINTING.

26:53.267 --> 26:54.667
VERY DISAPPOINTING.

26:54.667 --> 26:57.167
I THOUGHT THAT LENNOX GUY WAS--
WAS OUR GUY.

26:57.167 --> 26:58.467
- BUT HIS ALIBI WAS THAT GOOD?

26:58.467 --> 26:59.834
- YEAH, ROCK SOLID.

26:59.834 --> 27:01.601
I GUESS THE DNA YOU FOUND

27:01.601 --> 27:03.434
WAS FROM THE FIGHT
THAT HE HAD WITH GRACE.

27:03.434 --> 27:05.133
- WE CAN FIND THE EVIDENCE.

27:05.133 --> 27:07.367
WE CAN'T ALWAYS TELL YOU
WHEN IT GOT THERE.

27:07.367 --> 27:09.667
- YEAH, I GUESS IT'S TRUE.

27:09.667 --> 27:11.567
- I GUESS THAT'S THAT.

27:11.567 --> 27:13.300
YEAH, THIS MAY BE
ONE OF THOSE CASES

27:13.300 --> 27:15.434
WHERE YOU JUST HAVE TO HOPE--

27:23.667 --> 27:25.634
- JUST HAVE TO HOPE WHAT?

27:34.300 --> 27:36.901
- HOPE...

27:36.901 --> 27:39.901
THAT...THE...

27:42.133 --> 27:44.968
THAT THE CASE
WILL EVENTUALLY GET SOLVED.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.934
- YEAH, I HOPE SO TOO.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.501
- IN THIS UNCERTAIN WORLD,

27:57.501 --> 28:01.267
PEOPLE TAKE A CERTAIN COMFORT
IN SCIENTIFIC VERITIES.

28:01.267 --> 28:03.601
- ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY PUT
PEOPLE IN JAIL, I SUPPOSE.

28:03.601 --> 28:04.767
- YES, YES.

28:04.767 --> 28:07.000
- HOW ARE YOU MAINTAINING
YOUR STANDARDS

28:07.000 --> 28:08.934
IN THE FACE
OF ALL THESE BUDGET CUTS?

28:08.934 --> 28:10.000
- IT'S NOT EASY.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.701
THERE'S STILL A CERTAIN
COWBOY MENTALITY

28:12.701 --> 28:14.534
IN SOME POLICE DIVISIONS.

28:14.534 --> 28:18.033
I'M GONNA ASK THE COMMISSIONER
TO GET THEM TO STAND BACK

28:18.033 --> 28:20.968
AND ACCEPT THAT WE CAN'T
JUMP TO THEIR SERVICE

28:20.968 --> 28:22.434
EVERY TIME THEY CALL.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.234
- ANY BETS ON WHAT DIVISION
IT IS

28:24.234 --> 28:25.667
THAT HAS
THAT "COWBOY MENTALITY"?

28:25.667 --> 28:27.167
- HORSE PATROL?

28:27.167 --> 28:29.167
- CONGRATULATIONS.

28:29.167 --> 28:30.734
YOU HAVE NOW MADE AN ENEMY

28:30.734 --> 28:32.901
OF ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL
MEMBERS OF OUR DEPARTMENT.

28:32.901 --> 28:34.400
NOT ONLY FOR YOURSELF,

28:34.400 --> 28:36.133
BUT FOR
THE ENTIRE MAJOR CASE SQUAD.

28:36.133 --> 28:38.033
- WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

28:38.033 --> 28:39.734
- IT TELLS ME
WE'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING

28:39.734 --> 28:41.667
DNA TESTS ON OUR OWN
HIGH SCHOOL CHEMISTRY SETS.

28:41.667 --> 28:45.100
- DON'T YOU SEE
HE'S STRIKING BACK?

28:45.100 --> 28:47.000
HE'S CORNERED.
HE'S GUILTY.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.467
- I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU WERE
ACTUALLY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS.

28:50.467 --> 28:52.567
YOU'RE ENDANGERING
THIS DIVISION.

28:52.567 --> 28:54.901
YOU'RE ENDANGERING
YOUR ENTIRE CAREER.

28:54.901 --> 28:56.467
- I'M TRYING TO CATCH
A MURDERER.

28:56.467 --> 28:58.167
ISN'T THAT WHAT WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING AROU--

28:58.167 --> 29:00.133
- MURDERER? YOU STICK A GIRL
IN A SHORT SKIRT.

29:00.133 --> 29:01.467
AND HE BLINKED.

29:01.467 --> 29:03.334
MAYBE HE HAD DUST
IN HIS EYE.

29:03.334 --> 29:05.300
- WHEN YOU WERE MY PARTNER,

29:05.300 --> 29:06.934
YOU TRUSTED ME
ON THINGS LIKE THIS.

29:06.934 --> 29:08.601
- WHEN I WAS YOUR PARTNER,
ZACK,

29:08.601 --> 29:10.334
I ALMOST GOT SUSPENDED
ONCE A MONTH.

29:10.334 --> 29:14.200
NOW I AM CALLING HENRY MULLER
AND GETTING RIGHT WITH HIM,

29:14.200 --> 29:15.901
AND YOU ARE
OFF THE PUREFOY CASE.

29:20.100 --> 29:24.701
- I HAD A CALL FROM
YOUR CAPTAIN ROSS LAST NIGHT.

29:24.701 --> 29:26.234
- REALLY?

29:26.234 --> 29:27.667
- SAID YOU WERE MOVING ON.

29:27.667 --> 29:31.868
HANDING OFF
THE PUREFOY CASE.

29:31.868 --> 29:34.734
I KNOW YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED.

29:34.734 --> 29:37.100
I ONLY WISH THERE'D BEEN MORE
THAT I COULD'VE DONE.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.467
THAT POOR GIRL.

29:38.467 --> 29:40.601
- I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED.

29:40.601 --> 29:44.300
- BUT, UH, YOU SEEMED
SO SET ON SOLVING IT.

29:44.300 --> 29:45.701
- I STILL AM.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.033
I STILL WILL.

29:47.033 --> 29:50.000
- BUT, UH...
CAPTAIN ROSS--

29:50.000 --> 29:52.868
- HE DOESN'T CONTROL
MY FREE TIME.

29:52.868 --> 29:57.334
I'M GONNA WORK THAT CASE
NIGHTS, WEEKENDS, DAYS OFF.

29:57.334 --> 29:59.267
I'LL KNOCK ON EVERY DOOR
IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD

29:59.267 --> 30:01.334
TILL I FIND SOMEBODY
WHO KNOWS SOMETHING

30:01.334 --> 30:02.667
ABOUT SOMETHING.

30:09.167 --> 30:13.467
- THAT SOUNDS A BIT OBSESSIVE.

30:13.467 --> 30:15.834
- ISN'T THAT WHAT PEOPLE SAY
ABOUT YOU?

30:15.834 --> 30:18.200
- [chuckles]

30:18.200 --> 30:21.667
YES.
I SUPPOSE SO.

30:21.667 --> 30:24.033
OH, I TAKE SUGAR.

30:26.167 --> 30:27.167
HOW ABOUT YOU?

30:29.234 --> 30:30.434
PLAIN.

30:32.234 --> 30:35.501
- THIS REMINDS ME SOMEHOW
OF A CASE I HAD

30:35.501 --> 30:37.400
A FEW YEARS BACK.

30:37.400 --> 30:40.367
AN IMMIGRANT BRIDE WAS KILLED
BY HER CHEMIST HUSBAND

30:40.367 --> 30:42.067
WHEN HE FOUND OUT
SHE WASN'T A VIRGIN.

30:42.067 --> 30:45.334
HE POISONED HER
IN FRONT OF TEN FAMILY MEMBERS.

30:45.334 --> 30:46.767
THE M.E. DIDN'T CATCH IT.

30:46.767 --> 30:49.734
SODIUM FLUOROACETATE
IN HER GINGER ALE.

30:49.734 --> 30:53.067
DEATH WAS PUT DOWN
TO VENTRICULAR ARRHYTHMIA.

30:53.067 --> 30:54.534
- BUT YOU FIGURED IT OUT.

30:54.534 --> 30:56.934
- EH, I GOT LUCKY.

30:56.934 --> 30:59.434
IT CAN BE SO DARN EASY
TO KILL SOMEONE

30:59.434 --> 31:01.734
IF YOU <i>REALLY</i> KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

31:24.767 --> 31:26.901
- IF YOU BREW GREEN TEA
TOO LONG,

31:26.901 --> 31:28.667
TURNS BITTER.

31:28.667 --> 31:30.901
- REALLY?

31:39.534 --> 31:41.467
I THINK YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

31:43.767 --> 31:46.100
SORRY.

31:51.667 --> 31:54.000
- ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE
IS NOT EVIDENCE OF ABSENCE.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.734
THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
I TRY TO TEACH NEW CRIMINALISTS.

31:56.734 --> 31:58.033
- YOU LISTENING
TO HENRY'S BOOK?

31:58.033 --> 32:01.067
YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF HIM,
CAN YOU?

32:01.067 --> 32:02.467
- UH...

32:02.467 --> 32:04.133
YEAH, EVIDENTLY
THE FEELING ISN'T MUTUAL.

32:04.133 --> 32:05.467
I WENT TO SEE HIM
THIS MORNING.

32:05.467 --> 32:08.868
AND, UH, I'M PRETTY SURE
HE TRIED TO KILL ME.

32:08.868 --> 32:11.033
- EXCUSE ME?

32:11.033 --> 32:13.100
- BUT HE DIDN'T.

32:13.100 --> 32:16.100
BUT, UH,
HE MIGHT TRY AGAIN.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.067
HE SORT OF TOLD ME.

32:18.067 --> 32:19.234
WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU?

32:21.300 --> 32:25.100
- UH, WELL, I TOOK
SOME OF GRACE'S CLOTHES

32:25.100 --> 32:27.667
TO AN FBI LAB
AND CALLED IN A FAVOR.

32:27.667 --> 32:29.667
THEY FOUND MALE DNA.

32:29.667 --> 32:31.634
- ROSS TOOK US OFF THAT CASE.

32:31.634 --> 32:33.267
- HE TOOK YOU OFF THE CASE.

32:33.267 --> 32:35.367
I'M STILL THINKING
THE MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND--

32:35.367 --> 32:38.067
WHO, AS IT TURNS OUT,
HAS AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT

32:38.067 --> 32:41.133
FOR ASSAULT IN OHIO,
WHICH GETS US HIS DNA.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.634
- EXACTLY.

32:45.667 --> 32:47.267
LET'S GO ARREST HIM.

33:26.934 --> 33:28.734
- AH.

33:28.734 --> 33:30.267
I HEARD YOU WERE IN
THE BUILDING.

33:30.267 --> 33:31.634
- OH, IT'S NICHOLS.

33:31.634 --> 33:34.968
HE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY
ABOUT THE PUREFOY GIRL.

33:34.968 --> 33:36.968
[sighs]
HE CALLED IN A FAVOR

33:36.968 --> 33:38.667
AT COLUMBIA MEDICAL SCHOOL.

33:38.667 --> 33:41.367
HAD 'EM RUN A C.T.
AND M.R.I. SCANS OF THE BODY.

33:41.367 --> 33:43.901
- A VIRTUAL AUTOPSY?

33:43.901 --> 33:46.234
- WELL, IT'S EXPERIMENTAL
AND PRICEY.

33:46.234 --> 33:47.701
BUT IT WORKS.
- OH...[scoffs]

33:47.701 --> 33:51.601
- IT PICKED UP A SMALL AREA
OF INTERNAL PERIMORTEM BLEEDING.

33:51.601 --> 33:53.901
PROBABLY WHEN SHE WAS BEING
CLEANED OUT.

33:53.901 --> 33:57.200
WHOEVER WAS IN THERE
LEFT A HAIR.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.968
- WELL.
THAT'S A BREAK.

33:59.968 --> 34:02.801
- BUT I GATHER
YOU'RE A LITTLE BACKED UP.

34:02.801 --> 34:05.934
- OH. WELL.

34:05.934 --> 34:07.968
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

34:07.968 --> 34:10.333
I'LL GIVE IT
MY PERSONAL ATTENTION.

34:13.100 --> 34:15.033
- I WAS WITH KAREN,
ALL RIGHT?

34:15.033 --> 34:16.833
THE MOTHER, NOT THE DAUGHTER.

34:16.833 --> 34:19.266
WHAT KIND OF A CREEP
DO YOU THINK I AM?

34:19.266 --> 34:21.434
- YOU WEREN'T WITH KAREN
THE NIGHT GRACE WAS KILLED.

34:21.434 --> 34:24.199
- [sighs]
WE'RE...ON AND OFF.

34:24.199 --> 34:26.367
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.
- HOW ARE YOU LATELY?

34:26.367 --> 34:28.567
MORE ON, OR MORE OFF?

34:28.567 --> 34:30.067
- KINDA UP TO KAREN.

34:30.067 --> 34:31.534
ONE DAY SHE LIKES YOU,
THE NEXT DAY--

34:31.534 --> 34:33.701
- SHE DOESN'T LIKE THE WAY
YOU LOOK AT HER DAUGHTER?

34:33.701 --> 34:35.100
- NO.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.400
- HEARD YOU HAD A NEW SUSPECT.

34:37.400 --> 34:40.868
- YEAH, GRACE'S MOTHER'S
BOYFRIEND,

34:40.868 --> 34:42.400
WHO'S NOT GIVING ANYTHING UP
FOR THE MOMENT.

34:42.400 --> 34:44.900
- WHY DIDN'T HE
TURN UP EARLIER?

34:44.900 --> 34:48.634
- WE, UH, GOT DISTRACTED
BY SOME BAD THEORIES.

34:48.634 --> 34:49.967
- SOME OF US DID.

34:49.967 --> 34:51.900
THIS IS OUR GUY--
HE'S GOT A PRIOR CONVICTION

34:51.900 --> 34:54.033
FOR CHILD MOLESTATION
IN ILLINOIS

34:54.033 --> 34:56.467
AND THEY FOUND HIS DNA
ON GRACE'S CLOTHING.

34:56.467 --> 34:58.100
- WE ALREADY LOOKED
AT THOSE.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.534
- NOT THE, UH,
ONES SHE WAS KILLED IN.

35:00.534 --> 35:02.033
UH, CLOTHING
FROM HER APARTMENT.

35:02.033 --> 35:04.367
THEY NAILED THIS GUY.

35:04.367 --> 35:06.834
- [exhales deeply]

35:06.834 --> 35:10.200
RODGERS FOUND A HAIR
IN THE GIRL'S BODY.

35:10.200 --> 35:12.767
SHE SAID YOU WANTED
TO TAKE A REFERENCE SAMPLE?

35:12.767 --> 35:13.901
- OFF HIM.

35:13.901 --> 35:16.033
YOU WANT TO DO THE HONORS?
- MM.

35:22.767 --> 35:24.167
[knock at door]

35:24.167 --> 35:25.267
[door opens]

35:25.267 --> 35:27.868
- I NEED TO TAKE
A HAIR SAMPLE.

36:00.501 --> 36:02.567
[door opens]
- I'M TIRED.

36:04.968 --> 36:06.667
YOU'RE TIRED.

36:06.667 --> 36:09.200
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE THIS EASY
ON THE BOTH OF US?

36:09.200 --> 36:10.200
- [sighs]

36:10.200 --> 36:12.434
WE GOTTA GO THROUGH
ALL THIS AGAIN?

36:12.434 --> 36:14.767
YOU GUYS ARE WRONG.

36:14.767 --> 36:17.334
- YOU NEVER TOUCHED HER?
NOT ONCE? EVER?

36:17.334 --> 36:19.167
- SHE WAS A KID.

36:19.167 --> 36:20.901
I TOUCHED HER LIKE SHE WAS--

36:20.901 --> 36:22.100
LIKE YOU TOUCH A KID.

36:22.100 --> 36:24.834
- AND HOW IS THAT, NATE?
EXACTLY?

36:24.834 --> 36:27.300
- EAMES JUST, UH, STARTED
ANOTHER RUN AT HIM.

36:27.300 --> 36:29.434
WE'LL--WE'LL GET THERE.

36:29.434 --> 36:30.767
- I THINK I CAN HELP.

36:30.767 --> 36:32.734
HIS HAIR IS A MATCH.

36:33.934 --> 36:35.033
- YOU SURE?

36:35.033 --> 36:37.067
- NO DOUBT.

36:38.767 --> 36:39.968
- OKAY.

36:42.133 --> 36:45.000
[knocks on wall]

36:45.000 --> 36:46.234
IT'S DONE.

36:46.234 --> 36:48.000
- I'LL JUST LEAVE THIS
WITH CAPTAIN ROSS.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.033
- WE'RE--WE'RE DONE WITH,
UH, HIM, HENRY.

36:51.033 --> 36:52.901
NOT WITH YOU.

36:52.901 --> 36:55.267
- WHAT?
WAIT, WAIT.

36:55.267 --> 36:59.067
WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

36:59.067 --> 37:00.334
- THE HAIRS DON'T MATCH.

37:00.334 --> 37:03.400
- I TOOK THE REFERENCE SAMPLE
MYSELF.

37:03.400 --> 37:05.234
- RIGHT.
YOU HAD HIS HAIR.

37:05.234 --> 37:06.767
BUT THE HAIR
THAT RODGERS GAVE YOU

37:06.767 --> 37:09.033
DIDN'T COME FROM GRACE'S BODY.

37:09.033 --> 37:10.334
IT CAME FROM ME.

37:10.334 --> 37:11.701
AND I DIDN'T KILL HER.

37:11.701 --> 37:15.267
- WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU, NICHOLS?

37:15.267 --> 37:17.734
I AM FED UP
WITH YOUR GAMES.

37:17.734 --> 37:19.501
YOUR CAPTAIN TOLD ME
THEY WERE OVER.

37:19.501 --> 37:21.634
- HE--HE LIED TO YOU TOO.

37:21.634 --> 37:24.767
NATE DOESN'T HAVE
A PRIOR MOLESTATION CONVICTION.

37:24.767 --> 37:27.467
YOU KNEW GRACE.

37:29.968 --> 37:31.901
- I MEAN,
YOU'VE ALL GONE NUTS HERE.

37:31.901 --> 37:34.467
- UH, YOUR MOTHER LIVED
ACROSS THE STREET FROM HER.

37:34.467 --> 37:36.534
- OH, AND--
AND YOU KNOW EVERYONE

37:36.534 --> 37:38.267
WHO LIVES ACROSS THE STREET
FROM YOUR MOTHER?

37:38.267 --> 37:39.734
- WE'LL FIND PEOPLE
WHO SAW YOU TOGETHER.

37:39.734 --> 37:41.367
- WHO?
THAT MOTHER OF HERS?

37:41.367 --> 37:43.801
OH, THAT'LL BE GREAT TESTIMONY.

37:45.267 --> 37:46.934
- BECAUSE WE BOTH KNOW
THAT GRACE'S MOTHER

37:46.934 --> 37:49.367
IS A STONE ALCOHOLIC,
RIGHT?

37:51.601 --> 37:52.901
MM-HMM.

37:52.901 --> 37:54.801
WITH A MOTHER LIKE THAT,
SHE PROBABLY SPENT

37:54.801 --> 37:57.968
A LOT OF TIME...OUTSIDE.

37:57.968 --> 38:00.334
YOU SAW HER PLAYING.

38:00.334 --> 38:02.400
A YOUNG GIRL.

38:02.400 --> 38:05.167
SO...INNOCENT.

38:05.167 --> 38:06.667
SO PRETTY.

38:06.667 --> 38:09.534
- YOU LIVE
IN A WORLD OF STORIES.

38:09.534 --> 38:12.901
IT'S YOUR JOB--
FABRICATING NARRATIVES.

38:12.901 --> 38:14.100
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

38:14.100 --> 38:17.701
- YOU'VE ALWAYS LIKED
YOUNG GIRLS.

38:17.701 --> 38:19.234
IT'S YOUR SPECIALTY.
RIGHT?

38:19.234 --> 38:21.067
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU SOLVED THEIR CASES?

38:21.067 --> 38:22.501
- YEAH, WITH EVIDENCE.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.901
NOT GUESSES, CONJECTURES.

38:24.901 --> 38:27.300
- OKAY, EVIDENCE.

38:27.300 --> 38:29.901
UH, THE NIGHT
THAT GRACE WAS KILLED,

38:29.901 --> 38:32.734
SHE HAD A FIGHT
WITH JUSTIN LENNOX.

38:32.734 --> 38:34.067
HE SAW HER RUN AWAY

38:34.067 --> 38:35.601
IN THE DIRECTION
OF YOUR MOTHER'S APARTMENT.

38:35.601 --> 38:36.667
- SO--

38:36.667 --> 38:38.934
- YOU TOLD US
THAT YOU FOUND HIS DNA

38:38.934 --> 38:40.200
ON HER BODY.

38:40.200 --> 38:43.167
BUT THERE WAS NO USABLE DNA
ON HER BODY

38:43.167 --> 38:45.300
BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN BLEACHED,
WHICH YOU KNOW HOW TO DO.

38:45.300 --> 38:46.300
- OH...

38:46.300 --> 38:48.000
- AND YOU GOT LENNOX'S DNA

38:48.000 --> 38:50.701
FROM HIS ASSAULT FILE
IN THE EVIDENCE ROOM,

38:50.701 --> 38:52.434
WHICH YOU ENTERED
ON THE PRETEXT

38:52.434 --> 38:54.300
OF LOOKING AT A STABBING
IN SOHO,

38:54.300 --> 38:56.367
EVEN THOUGH THE DETECTIVE
IN CHARGE OF THAT CASE

38:56.367 --> 38:59.601
NEVER MADE A REQUEST
TO REEXAMINE EVIDENCE.

38:59.601 --> 39:02.868
- I DON'T NEED SOME DETECTIVE
TO MAKE A REQUEST.

39:02.868 --> 39:04.934
I WANTED TO NAIL THINGS DOWN.

39:04.934 --> 39:07.868
THAT VICTIM HAD BEEN STABBED
MULTIPLE TIMES.

39:07.868 --> 39:08.934
- YES, THAT VICTIM.

39:08.934 --> 39:11.934
A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL?

39:11.934 --> 39:14.968
THE KIND OF CASE THAT YOU
GO THE EXTRA MILE FOR.

39:14.968 --> 39:16.400
- ISN'T THAT WHAT WE DO?

39:16.400 --> 39:19.334
HELP THOSE WHO CAN NO LONGER
HELP THEMSELVES?

39:19.334 --> 39:21.334
- LIKE DEBORAH BRAND.
- YEAH.

39:21.334 --> 39:24.100
- LIKE JODY RICHARDS.
- YES.

39:24.100 --> 39:27.300
- LIKE CYNTHIA HONG.
AND ALL--

39:27.300 --> 39:29.601
ALL THESE.

39:29.601 --> 39:32.834
- I CLEARED THOSE CASES.
I CAUGHT THEIR KILLERS.

39:32.834 --> 39:35.234
- DON'T BOYS EVER GET KILLED,
HENRY?

39:35.234 --> 39:36.300
WHERE ARE THE BOYS?

39:36.300 --> 39:39.167
- BOYS?

39:39.167 --> 39:41.434
WHO ARE YOU?

39:41.434 --> 39:43.567
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE EVEN
TALKING ABOUT.

39:43.567 --> 39:46.901
- YOU WANTED TO BE AROUND
YOUNG GIRLS.

39:46.901 --> 39:50.868
BUT YOU COULDN'T TRUST YOURSELF
TO BE AROUND LIVE ONES,

39:50.868 --> 39:52.400
LIKE GRACE.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.000
SHE WASN'T
A LABORATORY SAMPLE

39:55.000 --> 39:56.200
OR AN AUTOPSY PHOTO.

39:56.200 --> 40:01.367
SHE WAS REAL AND BEAUTIFUL
AND ALIVE

40:01.367 --> 40:03.067
AND IN YOUR APARTMENT.

40:03.067 --> 40:06.634
YOU COULD SEE HER.
AND TOUCH HER.

40:06.634 --> 40:08.767
EVEN SMELL HER.

40:08.767 --> 40:11.267
I CAN SMELL HER IN THAT.
CAN'T YOU?

40:14.100 --> 40:16.000
SHE WAS FRIGHTENED, HENRY,
AND YOU PROTECTED HER,

40:16.000 --> 40:18.133
JUST LIKE YOU PROTECTED
ALL THE OTHERS.

40:18.133 --> 40:20.467
BUT WHY DO YOU PROTECT THEM,
HENRY?

40:20.467 --> 40:23.234
BECAUSE WHAT YOU REALLY WANT
TO DO WITH THEM ISN'T ALLOWED.

40:23.234 --> 40:25.167
NOT BY SOCIETY,
NOT BY YOU.

40:25.167 --> 40:27.767
YOU FOUND A WAY TO BE WITH THEM
WITHOUT REALLY BEING WITH THEM.

40:27.767 --> 40:29.968
BUT THEN THIS TIME...

40:29.968 --> 40:32.434
YOU WERE WITH GRACE,

40:32.434 --> 40:33.667
ALL ALONE.

40:33.667 --> 40:35.033
ALL LOVELY AND SO GRATEFUL

40:35.033 --> 40:37.868
FOR WHAT YOU'D DONE FOR HER,
WASN'T SHE?

40:39.033 --> 40:41.367
WASN'T SHE?

40:41.367 --> 40:44.367
- SHE KISSED ME.

40:44.367 --> 40:46.567
- HOW DID THAT FEEL, HENRY?

40:46.567 --> 40:47.834
DID YOU KISS HER BACK?

40:50.701 --> 40:52.634
- SHE...

40:52.634 --> 40:54.267
[stuttering]

40:54.267 --> 40:56.501
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

40:56.501 --> 40:59.067
- WHAT DID SHE SAY, HENRY?
WHAT DID SHE CALL YOU?

40:59.067 --> 41:00.767
- YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE CALLED ME.

41:00.767 --> 41:02.701
- PERVERT?

41:02.701 --> 41:04.901
- I AM NOT A PERVERT.

41:04.901 --> 41:09.100
I CATCH MURDERERS.

41:10.400 --> 41:13.400
- JUST LIKE HER MURDERER?

41:15.133 --> 41:16.834
- NO, I--

41:16.834 --> 41:18.801
I DON'T...

41:18.801 --> 41:20.901
UNDERSTAND HOW THAT HAPPENED.

41:20.901 --> 41:22.767
[breathing rapidly]

41:29.501 --> 41:33.467
HUH. IT'S--

41:33.467 --> 41:35.767
I NEVER WANTED--

41:35.767 --> 41:37.501
[voice breaking]

41:37.501 --> 41:39.234
I NEVER WANTED TO HURT HER.

41:44.300 --> 41:47.100
I NEVER MEANT TO HURT HER.

41:47.100 --> 41:49.868
- I KNOW, HENRY.

41:51.367 --> 41:53.601
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

42:12.601 --> 42:13.734
- THANK YOU.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.300
- HUH.
IT'S OFFICIAL.

42:18.300 --> 42:21.000
MARGO JANE WHEELER.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.067
- UH, DOES THE MOTHER KNOW
WE CLOSED THE CASE?

42:23.067 --> 42:25.601
- SHE WONDERED
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG.
