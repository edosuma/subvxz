WEBVTT

00:16.975 --> 00:18.518
Cynthia!

00:20.687 --> 00:21.521
Where are you?

00:29.404 --> 00:30.697
Cynthia!

00:33.033 --> 00:34.909
You were in my office again.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.119
Hm?

00:40.415 --> 00:41.750
Where are you?

00:48.798 --> 00:50.258
I know you're here.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.473
I will find you.

01:10.361 --> 01:11.571
Cynthia!

01:13.239 --> 01:14.741
Where are you?

01:16.367 --> 01:17.952
Cynthia!

01:19.370 --> 01:20.371
Cynthia!

02:16.845 --> 02:18.555
I've never seen
anything like this.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.861
Oh, look, another tooth.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.697
Performing my own autopsy.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.452
You should take a break, mate.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.915
You don't need to be here.
In fact, you shouldn't.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.042
There's no way
you can be objective about any of this.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.795
Man, we are finding chunks of my body

02:50.879 --> 02:52.338
in a probe that I built

02:52.881 --> 02:54.507
to make contact with alien life.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.427
I just feel like I should be here.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.690
Something else bothering you?

03:10.773 --> 03:11.733
Agatha.

03:15.403 --> 03:19.198
What exactly is the logic
of bringing your ex into deep space?

03:19.282 --> 03:20.366
We needed Thale.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.661
-For the mission?
-Yeah, we did.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.915
That's why we're here, the mission.
Please remember that.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.512
We're never
going to reach the Volcryn

03:41.596 --> 03:43.598
unless we deal with Cynthia.

03:43.681 --> 03:44.724
Permanently.

03:44.807 --> 03:47.644
The firewalls can't keep up,
and we're losing time.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.520
We need to lock her out.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.022
So, what's your plan?

03:51.105 --> 03:54.067
Well, in order to maintain
her consciousness,

03:54.150 --> 03:56.110
Cynthia Eris had to build
some sort of, um,

03:56.194 --> 03:58.154
of an organizing architecture.

03:58.238 --> 04:03.785
Without our bodies to relay sensation,
our minds panic,

04:03.868 --> 04:05.703
which is why she's so dangerous.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.455
-She's frightened.
-Yes.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.123
I need to go in there

04:09.207 --> 04:12.335
and find a way to seal her up
in that world.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.503
Permanently.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.964
-Karl, are you agreeing with this?
-I don't know.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.216
The whole thing makes me nervous.

04:18.299 --> 04:21.261
We're talking about containment,
not death?

04:21.344 --> 04:23.137
Yes. Your mother is still going
to be there,

04:23.221 --> 04:26.349
just unable to access
the systems of the ship.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.852
What if you get lost?

04:29.936 --> 04:31.980
Or if we lose
the connection to you inside there?

04:32.063 --> 04:33.189
We lose her.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.191
Forever.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.861
I'm not comfortable with this.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.405
After what happened to you the last time.

04:40.488 --> 04:44.534
A lot of people endured a lot of pain
for me to be in this place.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.827
The memory sphere.

04:47.996 --> 04:48.955
Show her your pain.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.041
It's hers, too.

05:00.049 --> 05:01.592
Practice must be brief today.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.138
The Elders
are becoming suspicious.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.701
-No! No!
-No! No!

05:26.784 --> 05:27.827
No, no, no.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.091
You know tech is forbidden.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.677
There are consequences to descension.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.807
Your gift
is worth the pain.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.435
Don't be afraid.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.563
Accept the price.

06:04.947 --> 06:06.074
The hands.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.251
I'm ready.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.253
It's what I'm here for.

07:00.336 --> 07:03.339
Are you sure that's safe?

07:05.049 --> 07:06.300
I'm worried about you.

07:07.218 --> 07:10.179
Before you wanted to hack that thing
out of your arm, and now you've got two.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.640
I need the bandwidth
if I'm going to find Cynthia.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.393
She scared the shit out of you last time.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.023
Are you sure?

07:21.858 --> 07:23.943
There are other things on this ship
that scare me more.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.503
What the hell?

07:45.214 --> 07:47.091
Jesus! Call medical!

07:47.341 --> 07:48.885
Speed it up!

07:48.968 --> 07:50.636
Get out of the way!

07:52.805 --> 07:54.307
Onto the table. Onto the table.

07:54.390 --> 07:56.100
-Quick. Tie him down.
-Up.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.061
Sedation! Sedation.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.606
There's too much blood. I need a visual.

08:01.689 --> 08:02.732
Wipe him down...

08:03.733 --> 08:05.026
Stand back, scanning!

08:12.116 --> 08:13.701
Where is the wound, please?

08:13.784 --> 08:17.205
I can't find it. It's dermal,
sub-dermal, arterial, all intact.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.290
Scissors.
Open the material, the top.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.795
-Wipe down the wound, please.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.674
Where is it coming from

08:32.762 --> 08:33.721
Stay back, please.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.812
Okay, everybody stop.

08:41.896 --> 08:45.441
Stop! Please, everybody.
We just need to breathe.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.943
Please, just trust me.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.196
Just close your eyes, take deep breaths.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.573
Close your eyes. Breathe.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.004
That was a fucking
tour de force performance.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.923
You should have seen the look
on your faces.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.594
Oh, my god.

09:17.014 --> 09:17.848
I...

09:17.932 --> 09:18.933
I don't understand.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.145
You should be ashamed of yourself.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.231
What?
You should be ashamed of yourself!

09:25.314 --> 09:26.857
I'm in desperate need
of medical assistance.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.485
-Hey. You are pushing your luck.
-What the fuck else am I supposed to do?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.821
I'm bored out of my nut. What

09:31.904 --> 09:33.656
-You scared the shit out of me.
-Well, I'm sorry.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.783
You look lovely today, by the way.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.619
You can just lay there for a little while,

09:38.703 --> 09:40.246
while I go clean up this mess
with the crew.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.747
Get me out of the fucking...

10:13.821 --> 10:15.781
I was on the Luna 71 shuttle.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.993
My wife and kids.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.079
We were on our way to Luna
to spend a week at the water resort.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.208
The L on that flight was one of the first.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.878
Just a little girl.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.673
It all started on takeoff.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.717
You know what takeoff is like, right?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.594
The gravity crush,
the ship shuddering

10:36.677 --> 10:38.679
as if it's going to break
into a thousand pieces.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.932
The kids loved it. Laughing, thrilled.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.477
Us adults,

10:45.978 --> 10:46.812
terrified.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.982
We didn't let it show, of course.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.401
But that little girl,

10:54.195 --> 10:55.738
she took our normal fear,

10:56.614 --> 10:57.907
and she amplified it.

10:59.241 --> 11:03.037
And once that fear was bouncing around,
getting bigger and louder,

11:03.120 --> 11:04.330
it turned into a wave.

11:06.582 --> 11:07.667
And the next minute,

11:08.793 --> 11:10.753
everyone's ripping each other apart.

11:12.588 --> 11:13.631
If...

11:15.299 --> 11:16.717
If...

11:21.055 --> 11:23.641
Now, I can't even remember
what my boys looked like.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.437
When I think of their faces,
all I see is what's left.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.980
Wasn't the little girl's fault, man.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.151
It was too much power for her to control.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.444
That's my point.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.072
All that power

11:38.155 --> 11:40.950
and you've never made a damn thing better
in this world, have you?

11:49.959 --> 11:50.960
Hey.

11:51.919 --> 11:52.753
We can use Thale.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.631
He can connect
with Lommie, in the Crystal.

11:55.714 --> 11:58.884
Be like a beacon for her, you know,
pull her out if she's in any trouble.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.263
We...

12:02.346 --> 12:04.974
-we can't trust him.
-We have to, Karl.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.893
Please. I want him to do
something meaningful.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.480
Let him be a part of this team.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.971
Hey, Lommie, look.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.223
It's us.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.314
Thale, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

12:53.397 --> 12:55.441
No, not a clue, bro.
This is uncharted territory.

12:56.233 --> 12:59.069
It's going to be just fine.
You can do this.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.697
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You're going to have to go.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.824
I can't think straight with
all your thoughts

13:03.908 --> 13:06.160
-bouncing around the room.
-No, Thale. I can't leave you.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.912
Agatha, trust me. You got to leave.

13:09.246 --> 13:10.623
He can stay, it doesn't bother me.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.666
He knows what we're up against.
But the rest of you...

13:12.750 --> 13:14.168
Come on, Agatha.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.045
If we're going to trust him,
we have to trust him.

13:17.880 --> 13:18.756
Are you okay?

13:21.675 --> 13:22.760
Be careful.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.221
You too, Lommie.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.097
Are you sure you're ready?

13:27.181 --> 13:29.099
We can't go on like this.
Neither can she.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.518
Go to the monitors in the mission lab.

13:30.601 --> 13:31.810
I'll need you to open the firewall

13:31.894 --> 13:33.229
-to let Lommie inside.
-Okay.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.003
You ready for me?

14:00.339 --> 14:01.757
Yeah. I guess.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.802
Oh.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.514
Okay.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.891
I can feel you.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.017
All right. Don't.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.729
Don't what?

14:15.813 --> 14:17.648
Be afraid. I'm just riding with you.

14:18.732 --> 14:19.817
I'm right here.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.028
We're ready.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.573
Move fast.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.741
She's going to fight back.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.141
What brings you, Rowan?

14:52.224 --> 14:54.894
I have a... petri dish.

14:55.853 --> 14:59.231
Full of cells
that don't seem to want to die.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.859
Oh, the probe! Do tell.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.028
How do you know about that?

15:04.820 --> 15:06.322
Well, the Volcryn sent me a message.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.035
Come on.

15:14.830 --> 15:15.873
Do you, uh...

15:17.166 --> 15:18.250
want to take a look?

15:19.293 --> 15:20.586
At your space blood?

15:22.004 --> 15:23.255
I thought you'd never ask.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.276
Outside a big house.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.158
There's trees, fog, birds.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.246
Loads of fucking birds.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.215
Fucking birds everywhere.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.383
That's Greywing.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.385
My grandfather's house.

16:10.636 --> 16:11.637
Lommie was right.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.931
My mother created a familiar world.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.436
There's no way in.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.190
Doors are locked.

16:23.273 --> 16:25.651
Windows are shuttered.
This place is a fortress.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.324
No, the doors, the locks,
those must be my firewalls.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.245
I wasn't sure how they'd manifest.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.540
Mel, open the door.

16:39.623 --> 16:40.833
Already on it.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.745
Someone is here.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.107
That's my doll.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.403
Who are you?

19:15.028 --> 19:16.822
We know why you're here.

19:20.951 --> 19:21.910
"We"?

19:21.994 --> 19:23.453
-Us.
-Us.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.291
-Me.
-Me.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.628
Cynthia!

19:31.712 --> 19:32.963
Him.

20:33.649 --> 20:36.401
I can feel you...

20:40.447 --> 20:41.698
What are you doing?

20:44.701 --> 20:48.121
Get your hand off that door!

21:44.469 --> 21:46.179
It's nice to have another toy.

21:53.687 --> 21:54.938
It's a pity, really.

22:27.763 --> 22:28.638
Who sent you?

22:31.266 --> 22:32.434
Roy?

22:32.517 --> 22:33.977
-Where are we?
-Home.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.021
-Are you here to play?
-She's here to trap us.

22:36.104 --> 22:37.731
-I'm here to help.
-To kill us!

22:37.814 --> 22:39.399
There's someone upstairs. Who is it?

22:39.483 --> 22:40.901
-A nobody.
-Who is it?

22:41.943 --> 22:43.236
-Daddy.
-A nothing.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.865
-Is this his house?
-No!

22:48.742 --> 22:52.162
-We should play with her.
-Playtime is over.

23:00.504 --> 23:03.090
God, I can't stand not being in the room.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.758
Someone else is solving the problem.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.635
Well, just trust Thale.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.179
For Lommie's sake, we said he's strong.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.309
Have you heard from Joy recently?

23:17.104 --> 23:18.146
How is she holding up?

23:19.731 --> 23:21.566
Yeah, she missed our last video call.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.653
She's undergoing
heavy memory release therapy.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.490
Getting rid of anything
that reminds her of Skye.

23:29.324 --> 23:30.158
Or me.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.702
My aunt, Luce,
did that when my father passed away.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.788
She just kept going and going

23:34.871 --> 23:36.748
until there was nothing left.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.543
She was gone.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.963
I mean, she never really came back.

23:43.463 --> 23:46.550
I can't tell Joy what to do,
but I'm not going to do that with Skye.

23:47.676 --> 23:48.885
I don't want to forget about her.

23:52.889 --> 23:54.141
You're doing great, Karl.

23:55.433 --> 23:59.312
Grief is a natural process.
You can't just hide from it.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.482
You just have to face
whatever comes your way

24:02.566 --> 24:03.441
with an open heart.

24:10.157 --> 24:11.700
Sleeping beauty is awake.

24:14.995 --> 24:17.330
Uh, what happened?

24:17.414 --> 24:18.748
Thale managed to pull you out.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.876
You were unconscious for two days.

24:23.795 --> 24:24.921
Two days?

24:26.798 --> 24:27.883
Um.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.843
Sorry, I couldn't trap her.

24:31.595 --> 24:32.846
She was too strong.

24:32.929 --> 24:34.848
Well, maybe you should've stayed
and finished the job?

24:34.931 --> 24:37.434
It's not her fault.
She can't finish anything.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.896
But I take it you found her?

24:41.605 --> 24:42.439
Pieces.

24:42.522 --> 24:45.358
She was fractured into two sub-processes.

24:45.442 --> 24:48.069
A younger one, uncorrupt.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.196
The other.

24:50.614 --> 24:52.032
-Broken.
-Mm.

24:55.368 --> 24:57.412
-I should go back in...
-No, no, no.

24:59.831 --> 25:00.874
Rest.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.084
You need to rest.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.296
Cynthia made everything clear.

25:07.797 --> 25:08.965
She talked to you?

25:09.633 --> 25:11.176
Well, through me, actually.

25:11.259 --> 25:12.969
Yeah, come through my head,
clear as a bell.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.430
This mission is over.

25:18.475 --> 25:20.310
I don't... I don't understand.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.315
-Where's Karl?
-Karl was wrong.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.693
The Volcryn aren't what he thought.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.362
They might not even be real.

25:30.445 --> 25:32.197
Maybe we should just kill D'Branin.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.282
That way, we could all go home.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.284
Cynthia lived a difficult life.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.120
Suffered too much.

25:40.705 --> 25:44.251
She built this ship to escape that world.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.964
To fly away from old monsters,

25:50.048 --> 25:52.008
not into the arms of new ones.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.720
She put her life into this ship.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.224
It's not meant to be a prison for her.

26:01.559 --> 26:03.353
It's meant to be freedom.

26:05.689 --> 26:06.982
She was...

26:07.983 --> 26:08.942
-I am
-I am

26:10.568 --> 26:11.820
-everywhere.
-everywhere.

26:12.862 --> 26:14.322
Always listening.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.618
Always watching.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.176
You knew he was watching?

26:41.808 --> 26:43.435
We were just having some fun.

26:45.645 --> 26:49.524
We needed to distract long enough
to find the break in the firewall

26:49.607 --> 26:51.067
you used to get in here.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.460
I must be off now.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.173
I'll tell Karl you said hello.

27:13.256 --> 27:14.215
No! No!

27:17.302 --> 27:18.261
What's happening?

27:19.346 --> 27:20.430
It's your mother.

27:21.806 --> 27:22.766
She's out.

27:32.692 --> 27:34.444
Releasing your memories of me,

27:36.321 --> 27:37.364
it's okay.

27:41.326 --> 27:44.537
I don't even know
if I'm going to come back from out here.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.164
Anyways, it's probably for
the best, right?

28:04.766 --> 28:07.102
Warning. Oxygen depleting.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.448
Warning. Oxygen, 80%.

28:25.328 --> 28:26.413
Help!

28:28.790 --> 28:30.792
Sir, there's a problem with the air flow.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.505
D'Branin's quarters...

28:35.588 --> 28:37.549
Warning. Oxygen, 16%.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.229
Help!

28:51.312 --> 28:53.231
Oxygen, 14%.

28:53.314 --> 28:54.315
Help!

28:56.151 --> 28:57.527
Oxygen level critical.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.115
Oxygen level critical.

29:06.035 --> 29:08.246
-Oxygen eliminated.
-Help!

29:09.038 --> 29:10.665
-To the hull!

29:14.669 --> 29:16.296
Karl! Stay with us.
We're going to get you out!

29:16.379 --> 29:18.882
-The hatch is disabled.
-What? We've got to get this door open!

29:18.965 --> 29:20.467
Give me that and get engineering.

29:20.550 --> 29:21.885
-Stand clear!
-Move back.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.846
-It's not opening!
-This doesn't make sense.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.306
-Do something!
-All right. I'm on it!

29:26.389 --> 29:28.349
-Karl! Karl!

29:57.086 --> 29:59.130
Karl! Karl.

30:03.843 --> 30:04.886
-Oh, god!

30:11.518 --> 30:13.311
-You're okay.
-How did you...

30:15.021 --> 30:16.022
How did you know?

30:17.607 --> 30:18.900
We have to get you to Medical.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.487
Cynthia. Cynthia...

30:23.238 --> 30:24.322
She's out.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.451
Power systems error.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.078
Switching to reserves mode.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.582
Initiating reboot procedure.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.131
Oh, my god. Thale?

30:42.549 --> 30:43.508
-I tried...
-Where's Lommie?

30:43.591 --> 30:46.177
-She's locked in now. I can't find her.
-Is she okay

30:46.261 --> 30:48.471
Is she alive in there

30:48.555 --> 30:50.139
Try and re-establish contact with Lommie?

30:50.223 --> 30:51.808
She's coming.

30:51.891 --> 30:53.560
Cynthia is coming.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.904
Your friends are going to die now.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.367
There's nothing
you can do.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.204
You're trapped inside here with me now.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.332
There's no getting out.

31:19.669 --> 31:21.087
Where are you going?

31:22.714 --> 31:24.173
What are you going to do?

31:40.732 --> 31:42.066
Please stop.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.487
Don't open the door.

31:46.571 --> 31:47.614
It will bring him back.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.877
She's not going to like this.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.754
I know.

32:18.603 --> 32:19.729
Mother is scared.

32:32.617 --> 32:33.743
You came back.

32:39.666 --> 32:42.251
I wasn't going to hurt your friends.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.590
I just wanted you to behave.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.355
I was angry.

33:04.190 --> 33:06.025
I've been alone in here.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.070
You must understand.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.322
What are you keeping behind this door?

33:19.038 --> 33:20.373
It's your father, isn't it?

33:23.084 --> 33:24.794
It's not the Crystal that made you

33:26.462 --> 33:27.463
like this.

33:28.840 --> 33:29.966
It was him.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.345
He beat us.

33:35.888 --> 33:36.931
He demeaned us.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.685
He tore us down.

33:47.525 --> 33:49.652
You had trouble with your father, too.

33:52.321 --> 33:53.823
I've watched your memories.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.951
You hurt him with that hammer.

34:00.538 --> 34:01.706
That's where you're wrong.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.001
My dad loved me.

34:06.961 --> 34:09.505
It was this fucking world
that kicked me in the teeth.

34:09.589 --> 34:11.758
-I had to accept the price.
-...accept the price.

34:18.097 --> 34:18.931
Come on!

34:19.015 --> 34:21.017
Daddy, no! Please! No!

34:34.572 --> 34:35.656
Go hide!

34:36.657 --> 34:38.534
Go! Go, run!

34:54.926 --> 34:56.094
Thale.

34:57.762 --> 34:58.888
Thale?

35:00.389 --> 35:02.391
Get me out!

35:31.420 --> 35:34.048
Systems stabilizing.
No trace of malicious code.

35:35.925 --> 35:36.968
Nice work.

35:38.511 --> 35:39.637
How are you feeling?

35:39.720 --> 35:42.640
Uh... Still a little shaky, I guess.

35:42.723 --> 35:43.724
Roy?

35:44.600 --> 35:46.602
-What is it?
-I can't hear her voice.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.939
For the first time, it's quiet.

35:50.022 --> 35:51.107
You're welcome.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.280
Hey, I'm proud of you.

35:57.363 --> 35:58.781
We should get you back to the Dome.

35:58.865 --> 35:59.907
We could all use some rest.

36:03.578 --> 36:04.620
What was it?

36:05.746 --> 36:06.956
Her weakness?

36:08.624 --> 36:09.792
We all have secrets.

36:11.085 --> 36:13.713
Parts of our past we'd rather forget.

36:13.796 --> 36:14.964
And is she okay?

36:16.841 --> 36:17.884
Where she is?

36:19.093 --> 36:20.178
Is it peaceful?

36:21.429 --> 36:23.681
-Is it secure?
-I locked her out.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.271
You did so good.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.523
I need to go lie down.

36:33.941 --> 36:35.234
Here. Let me help you.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.238
You saved our lives

36:39.322 --> 36:40.615
and the mission.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.620
You, uh, go ahead.

36:47.538 --> 36:48.497
Release me.

36:49.165 --> 36:50.499
Please start over.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.294
I just want you to be happy.

38:31.267 --> 38:32.560
Hey.

38:33.853 --> 38:35.354
I was looking for you.

38:35.438 --> 38:37.440
-You weren't in your quarters.
-No, I couldn't sleep.

38:38.899 --> 38:40.484
-Tell me what's wrong.
-Don't touch me.

38:46.073 --> 38:47.283
You let him watch us?

38:51.454 --> 38:53.372
How many times were we together

38:53.456 --> 38:55.333
-with Eris there, watching?
-He watches everything.

38:55.416 --> 38:58.210
-I don't understand what the big deal is.
-Where was my voice in that decision?

39:01.714 --> 39:02.882
Okay, I'm sorry.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.719
I really am. I'm sorry.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.432
Don't come to my room anymore.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.154
Open.

39:25.988 --> 39:26.989
Lights.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.076
Is everything okay?

39:30.159 --> 39:31.243
Everything is fine.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.876
I heard your voice. You're in my head.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.170
You called me back.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.637
When I opened my eyes,

39:50.471 --> 39:51.680
I was glad it was you.

40:13.035 --> 40:14.745
Tell me
if this actually makes any sense.

40:14.829 --> 40:15.663
Okay.

40:15.746 --> 40:20.000
Cells can speak chemically to other cells

40:20.084 --> 40:22.586
across vast distances inside our bodies.

40:23.796 --> 40:25.631
Whilst animals,

40:25.714 --> 40:29.176
like bees, butterflies, or ants,

40:29.260 --> 40:33.681
can speak wordlessly across vast distances
outside their bodies.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.642
Could someone, in theory,

40:37.685 --> 40:42.231
use those methods
to communicate across galaxies?

40:43.315 --> 40:45.860
You mean, use them like a radio
or a telephone?

40:46.986 --> 40:48.112
Yeah.

40:50.072 --> 40:52.408
A human being,

40:52.491 --> 40:54.285
one of two tin cans

40:55.744 --> 41:00.541
at either end of a very long,
invisible string.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.508
I mean these... these cells,

41:10.926 --> 41:12.261
they are transmitting.

41:12.344 --> 41:15.181
Maybe just to one another,
but maybe--

41:15.264 --> 41:18.309
You think the Volcryn sent
the probe back to talk to us?

41:21.353 --> 41:23.939
I think they sent it back to listen.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.460
Activate display 337, please.

41:54.053 --> 41:54.970
Hello, beautiful.

42:12.154 --> 42:14.490
My body is failing, Auggie.

42:14.573 --> 42:17.076
But this is not goodbye.

42:17.159 --> 42:18.452
I will always be here,

42:19.245 --> 42:20.246
close to you.

42:21.121 --> 42:23.707
I will always love you, little bear.
