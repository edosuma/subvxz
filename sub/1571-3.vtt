Hey, thanks for helping me pick
out a new computer, you guys.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.372
Oh, no problem,
Quagmire.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.041
God, this place is
always so crowded.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.709
We gotta find someone
who works here.

00:43.711 --> 00:44.910
Can I help you, sir?

00:44.912 --> 00:47.479
Sorry, all I got
is a quarter, pal.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.148
Oh, excuse me, sir.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.016
My buddy here is
looking for a computer.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.218
I would like to elect you
president.

00:55.088 --> 00:56.422
What are you doing?

00:56.424 --> 00:58.190
You gonna get a new phone
while we're here?

00:58.192 --> 00:59.858
Maybe. But I gotta see
which one

00:59.860 --> 01:02.261
I wanna take in and out of
my pocket every 30 seconds

01:02.263 --> 01:03.562
for the next six years.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.863
What do you think,
Peter? Peter?

01:04.865 --> 01:08.167
I touched a iPhone headphone.

01:09.869 --> 01:12.004
You know what?
I think I'm gonna
go with this one.

01:12.006 --> 01:14.173
Guy said it's
the newest version.
Just came out this week.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.441
Ah, good call,
Quagmire.

01:15.443 --> 01:16.842
You're gonna be like
the first guy

01:16.844 --> 01:18.210
in the neighborhood
to own a Model T.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.546
(engine chugging)

01:20.548 --> 01:22.347
See ya, suckers!

01:22.349 --> 01:26.118
I'll be there an hour after you
with throw-up all over my legs!

01:29.389 --> 01:31.256
Are you getting excited
for Halloween, Stewie?

01:31.258 --> 01:33.225
You know, we'll have
to start thinking

01:33.227 --> 01:34.560
about your costume soon.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.028
All right, but let's make sure

01:36.030 --> 01:37.763
we don't cover up this,
all right?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.765
It's what puts candy in the bag.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.533
Oh, look, Chris,
here's your costume

01:41.535 --> 01:43.535
from the year you went
as a condom.

01:43.537 --> 01:46.238
What the hell are you
supposed to be?

01:46.240 --> 01:49.408
(gasps)
Oh, Stewie, look!

01:49.410 --> 01:52.010
It's your very
first teddy bear!

01:53.246 --> 01:55.280
Oscar?

01:55.282 --> 01:57.116
Wow, I remember
that bear.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.084
That's the one Grandma
and Grandpa brought Stewie

01:59.086 --> 02:00.953
when he was still
in the hospital.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.654
Oh, and here's the card
they sent me.

02:02.656 --> 02:07.459
"Three kids on $40,000?
Have fun with your crap life."

02:07.461 --> 02:09.294
I guess he got tucked
away up here.

02:09.296 --> 02:11.063
You want him back,
sweetie?

02:14.501 --> 02:15.567
What, this old thing?

02:15.569 --> 02:16.835
No, no, thank you.
I've grown.

02:16.837 --> 02:17.903
I've changed.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.304
You sure you
don't want him?

02:19.306 --> 02:20.506
I said no, okay?

02:20.508 --> 02:21.840
Don't you have
a wedding dress

02:21.842 --> 02:24.009
to try halfway on
and then cry about?

02:27.280 --> 02:28.580
(phone rings)

02:28.582 --> 02:30.482
Hello? Oh, hey, Quagmire.
What's up?

02:30.484 --> 02:32.818
Hey, Peter, I need
some help with my computer.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.019
I can't find my photos.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.354
Did you look
under "Photos"?

02:35.356 --> 02:36.421
What is that?

02:36.423 --> 02:37.756
It's a folder
called "Photos."

02:37.758 --> 02:39.124
Yeah, I-I don't have that.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.026
I just have 40 folders
all called "New Folder."

02:41.028 --> 02:43.095
Okay. You know what?
Click on your hard drive.

02:43.097 --> 02:44.696
Okay, now-now the arrow
on the screen,

02:44.698 --> 02:46.165
that's me, right?

02:46.167 --> 02:47.833
Yeah, yeah, that's you.
Okay, now-now just...

02:47.835 --> 02:49.801
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
There's a calculator
on this thing?!

02:49.803 --> 02:52.137
(sighs) Listen, Quagmire,
what are you trying to do?

02:52.139 --> 02:53.772
I just wanna put pictures
of my cat

02:53.774 --> 02:54.806
on everyone's
Internet computer.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.308
Like, how do I do that?

02:56.310 --> 02:57.843
Okay, wait.
There's an agreement
that just popped up.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.344
Hang on. L-Let me read
the whole thing.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.979
Just hit "Accept."

03:00.981 --> 03:02.381
Well, that seems
a little foolhardy,
doesn't it, Peter?

03:02.383 --> 03:04.183
Look, do we have
to do this now?

03:04.185 --> 03:05.184
I'm watching something.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.351
I know. I'm sorry.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.120
I-I'm just nervous
that somebody else

03:08.122 --> 03:09.688
is gonna get pictures
of their cat on the
Internet first,

03:09.690 --> 03:11.623
and then I'll always be known
as the second guy

03:11.625 --> 03:13.458
to get pictures of his cat
on the Internet.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.360
Quagmire, I don't know
how to tell you this,

03:15.362 --> 03:16.962
but there's already
cats on the Internet.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.530
Wait, it's-it's giving me
that pinwheel thing.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.333
It-It's frozen. Oh, my God,
oh, my God, it crashed!

03:21.335 --> 03:22.668
The whole thing
just crashed!

03:22.670 --> 03:23.869
Geez, Quagmire,
calm down.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.003
We'll figure it out.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.505
No, Peter,
the whole thing's fried!

03:26.507 --> 03:27.739
I can't even...!

03:27.741 --> 03:29.341
(gasps) Ah! damn it!
What the hell?!

03:29.343 --> 03:31.410
Hey, you clicked "Accept."

03:34.547 --> 03:36.315
Hey, what's going on?

03:36.317 --> 03:37.749
You doing some
reading there?

03:37.751 --> 03:39.551
Yes, well, you know
I turn to poetry

03:39.553 --> 03:41.486
when matters of the heart
weigh heavily on me.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.222
"If you're happy
and you know it,

03:43.224 --> 03:46.692
"then your face will
surely show it.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.827
"If you're happy
and you know it,

03:48.829 --> 03:50.395
"clap your hands.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.430
Anonymous."

03:51.432 --> 03:52.664
Wait-- matters
of the heart?

03:52.666 --> 03:54.366
What are you
talking about?

03:54.368 --> 03:56.735
Well, Lois found my old teddy
bear, Oscar, in the attic.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.037
And I'm just not sure how
to handle it,

03:59.039 --> 04:00.706
what with Rupert and all.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.207
Who cares?
Just play with them both.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.442
I can't do that!

04:03.444 --> 04:05.210
Oh, it would be
so awkward!

04:05.212 --> 04:06.545
Um... okay.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.779
Oscar was my...

04:07.781 --> 04:09.581
well, he was my first,
you know.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.183
And that's always exciting.

04:11.185 --> 04:13.218
But-but I've been
with Rupert for so
long now.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.353
Uh-huh.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.621
Most of our finances
are intertwined.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.055
We've built
a life together.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.924
On the other hand,
Oscar...

04:18.926 --> 04:21.093
Oscar's the only one who can
really make me laugh.

04:21.095 --> 04:24.730
I hate to say it,
but I'm mostly with Rupert
because of his insurance.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.298
Stewie, I think you're
overthinking this.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.066
No, you're right.
You're right, Brian.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.101
I'm with Rupert now.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.769
I just need
to forget Oscar.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.238
No matter how intense
our relationship was.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.040
(stereo playing jazz)

04:37.110 --> 04:38.944
That's amazing.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.879
It's like you took
all the colors that exist

04:40.881 --> 04:44.449
and said, "(bleep),
here's a new one."

04:48.621 --> 04:50.055
Hi, can I help you?

04:50.057 --> 04:51.290
Well, that depends.

04:51.292 --> 04:52.724
Do you know how
to fix pieces of junk?!

04:52.726 --> 04:54.159
Haven't been stumped yet.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.295
(computer plays woman moaning)

04:56.297 --> 04:59.264
Okay, I see what
your problem is.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.400
I-I-I tried to buy
a sweater online,

05:01.402 --> 05:03.168
and I-I think
I got a virus.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.637
No, the porn's
not the problem.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.105
Your browser history shows

05:07.107 --> 05:08.940
that you've been going
to kinkylatinas.net.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.310
But that site has
a bunch of malware.

05:11.312 --> 05:12.611
Oh.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.279
Personally, I'd recommend
College Latinas.

05:14.281 --> 05:16.648
I mean, I wanna see Latinas,
but I also want them to

05:16.650 --> 05:18.650
Speak English.
speak English.
Yes, exactly.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.586
Wow. So you're into that kind
of stuff, too?

05:21.588 --> 05:23.689
(sultry):
Uh-huh.

05:24.924 --> 05:27.192
Would you, uh,
would you have
dinner with me?

05:27.194 --> 05:28.860
Absolutely.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.363
Excuse me. I bought this
laptop here yesterday,

05:31.365 --> 05:34.333
but when I got home I noticed
the apple already had

05:34.335 --> 05:37.102
a bite taken out of it!

05:41.874 --> 05:43.508
So, yeah, I was
the first woman

05:43.510 --> 05:45.777
to ride her bike
cross-country
with no seat.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.045
Gosh, that's neat, Sonja.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.380
And-and where'd
you go to college?

05:48.382 --> 05:50.482
I think Syracuse,
but I don't know.

05:50.484 --> 05:53.185
My face was buried
in a pillow all four years.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.654
Wow, sounds like you took
a full class load.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.222
(laughs)

05:57.224 --> 06:00.392
Oh, Glenn, I'm so glad
you asked me out.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.027
Whenever I talk
about stuff like this,

06:02.029 --> 06:03.495
most people look at me

06:03.497 --> 06:05.297
like I'm some kind
of disgusting perv.

06:05.299 --> 06:06.531
Me, too, but who cares?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.333
You should never be afraid
to be different.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.301
Hoo.

06:09.303 --> 06:10.335
Hoo.

06:10.337 --> 06:13.071
Whom.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.143
Morning.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.912
(yawns) Morning.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.181
We kind of had
a crazy night.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.583
Yeah, we... Did we?

06:24.585 --> 06:26.251
I don't really remember,

06:26.253 --> 06:28.520
but I do feel like I might
be down a couple of quarts.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.921
(empty metal drum banging)

06:29.923 --> 06:32.324
Well, even though you seemed
like a sure thing,

06:32.326 --> 06:35.227
I really wanted
to make sure.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.997
Oh, my God!
You roofied me?!

06:38.999 --> 06:40.198
Are you mad?

06:40.200 --> 06:44.002
No. I'm in love!

06:45.938 --> 06:47.205
Sonja, honey,
stay right here.

06:47.207 --> 06:49.174
I just have to go
to the bathroom.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.442
Wait, Glenn.

06:50.444 --> 06:53.245
Take this wine glass.
We can use it later.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.247
(voice breaks):
My God, I...

06:55.249 --> 06:57.182
I've never been so happy!

07:03.122 --> 07:05.924
I'm telling you guys,
Sonja is the perfect woman.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.393
She's every bit as kinky
and as insatiable as I am.

07:08.395 --> 07:11.196
Really?
I thought you said she was
just some computer geek.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.798
She is.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.534
Her mouth has enough storage
space for a giggity-byte. Oh!

07:15.536 --> 07:17.068
(text alert beeps)

07:17.070 --> 07:18.904
Geez, you changed your
relationship status already?

07:18.906 --> 07:20.372
When you know, you know.

07:20.374 --> 07:22.140
All right, but just
be careful, ya know?

07:22.142 --> 07:23.809
You don't wanna rush an
important decision.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.277
I'll take
the cheeseburger meal.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.379
Would you like to make it
an extra large meal?

07:27.381 --> 07:30.148
Uh...

07:32.652 --> 07:33.985
(insects chirring)

07:35.988 --> 07:37.255
(thunder crashes)

07:37.257 --> 07:38.657
(birds chirping)

07:38.659 --> 07:40.559
(insects chirring)

07:40.561 --> 07:42.327
(wind whistling)

07:42.329 --> 07:43.929
(people screaming, shouting)

07:43.931 --> 07:46.231
(explosion)

07:46.233 --> 07:48.266
(people screaming, shouting)

07:48.268 --> 07:50.001
(lasers zapping)

07:55.174 --> 07:56.775
N-No. Yes.

07:56.777 --> 07:57.976
No.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.278
You sure? It's only
29 cents more.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.513
Yes.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.482
No.

08:07.954 --> 08:09.855
What the hell?

08:12.358 --> 08:13.658
Stewie, what are you doing
up here?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.527
(gasps)
Brian!

08:15.529 --> 08:16.995
It's not what you think!

08:16.997 --> 08:18.630
All right, I came up here
for a photo shoot

08:18.632 --> 08:20.632
and it just got way,
way out of hand!

08:20.634 --> 08:21.700
You're having tea.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.268
How is that
out of hand?

08:23.270 --> 08:25.036
Is your shirt
on backwards?

08:25.038 --> 08:27.372
Please! You can't tell Rupert
I was up here, all right?

08:27.374 --> 08:29.040
He wouldn't understand.
He'll kill himself, Brian!

08:29.042 --> 08:30.609
He's been through so much
already!

08:30.611 --> 08:32.210
He can't take much more!

08:32.212 --> 08:34.513
Brian, he watched
his brother drown!

08:34.515 --> 08:35.981
Stewie, relax.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.816
You're getting all
worked up over nothing.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.351
Says the guy who freaks out

08:39.353 --> 08:41.386
every time
a fire engine goes by.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.654
(siren wails)

08:42.656 --> 08:44.489
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

08:44.491 --> 08:46.024
(howls)

08:46.026 --> 08:49.561
Peter, Peter,
you hear that?!
(howls)

08:49.563 --> 08:53.698
I'm matching the sound!
(howls)

08:53.700 --> 08:55.901
Is what I'm doing helping?

08:59.205 --> 09:01.540
Glenn, why did you
bring me here?

09:01.542 --> 09:02.807
Well, I've always had
this fantasy

09:02.809 --> 09:04.242
of having sex on
the basketball court

09:04.244 --> 09:05.810
in front of my
high school principal.

09:05.812 --> 09:10.015
Only problem is he's
now completely senile.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.517
Yeah, you like this,
Principal Goodrich, huh?

09:12.519 --> 09:13.752
Remember you once
suspended me

09:13.754 --> 09:15.353
for showing my wiener
in school?

09:15.355 --> 09:16.888
I did?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.024
This isn't as much fun
as I thought it would be.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.992
I'm sorry, Sonja,
I don't think I can finish.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.061
You never could finish,
Quagmire!

09:23.063 --> 09:25.430
Donahue, get in there!

09:26.933 --> 09:29.668
Okay, Glenn, now that we've
covered ourselves in black ink,

09:29.670 --> 09:31.269
let's do it until
we've created

09:31.271 --> 09:34.573
every character in
the Chinese alphabet.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.084
When all said and done,

09:46.086 --> 09:49.454
Quagmire body tell story
of sadness.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.960
Oh, wow, I can't even imagine
what twisted deviant act

09:54.962 --> 09:56.595
you've thought of this time.

09:56.597 --> 09:59.197
I want you to have sex
with your father.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.732
What?!

10:00.734 --> 10:02.367
Yep, and I'm gonna watch.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.535
Hi, Glenn.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.604
Are you crazy?! No!
No way!

10:05.606 --> 10:08.206
Glenn, remember,
the thing we love
most about each other

10:08.208 --> 10:09.874
is that we push
each other

10:09.876 --> 10:13.311
way beyond
our normal boundaries.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.647
Did you enjoy your stay
at the Marriott?

10:15.649 --> 10:17.716
No, I did not.

10:20.753 --> 10:24.255
STEWIE:
Oh, well, excuse me for not
being six months old anymore!

10:24.257 --> 10:26.224
Oh, and here come
the tears!

10:26.226 --> 10:29.227
The show is starting,
everyone! Come on down!

10:30.596 --> 10:32.330
What's all that noise?

10:32.332 --> 10:33.798
What the hell's
going on up there?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.433
We're in a fight is
what's going on!

10:35.435 --> 10:37.469
Brian, I need you to settle
an argument for us:

10:37.471 --> 10:38.670
am I Hitler?

10:38.672 --> 10:40.405
Because I don't think
that I am,

10:40.407 --> 10:43.108
(chuckling): but maybe-maybe
I'm off base on this.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.242
Stewie, take it easy.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.510
No, you know what?

10:45.512 --> 10:46.578
You may as well call
your family now

10:46.580 --> 10:48.013
because I'm not going
to Sarasota.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.681
I don't care
if we can't get a refund,

10:49.683 --> 10:50.749
we're through!

10:50.751 --> 10:51.950
Here, Brian, you take him.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.151
Maybe you can make him happy.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.619
What?
You heard me. Take him.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.254
Do whatever you want
with him, I don't care.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.589
Rupert and I are over!

10:57.591 --> 10:58.623
Are you sure?

10:58.625 --> 10:59.791
Yes, we're done.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.292
I just hope we can
handle it better

11:01.294 --> 11:02.927
than blue and yellow
did when they split up.

11:02.929 --> 11:05.030
You were supposed to have
the kids here by 5:00.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.164
We have plans.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.332
It's 5:15.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.667
Stop busting my hump, Alicia.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.168
Okay, you know
what, let's not...

11:10.170 --> 11:11.536
let's not do this
in front of the kids.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.837
God, you're right.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.005
What ever happened to us?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.874
Hey, baby, you
ready for dinner?

11:15.876 --> 11:16.975
What's up, Scott?

11:16.977 --> 11:19.244
We gonna get
some barbecue.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.648
Hey, guys.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.183
No, indoors, not okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.551
Don't do it.
Nighttime, not allowed.

11:26.553 --> 11:27.986
What? There's nothing
wrong with this.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.121
No, no way, give me those.

11:31.390 --> 11:32.557
Oh, my God.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.159
Quagmire,
what the hell happened?

11:34.161 --> 11:35.694
Is this another one
of those sex-related injuries

11:35.696 --> 11:36.861
you keep getting?

11:36.863 --> 11:38.563
Yeah, it seems like lately

11:38.565 --> 11:40.565
that girlfriend of yours is
taking things a little too far.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.967
No, she's not;
everything's great with us.

12:05.257 --> 12:07.092
Are you guys still talking
about Sonja?

12:07.094 --> 12:08.426
All right, I should
probably get going.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.761
Sonja and I are
supposed to go

12:09.763 --> 12:12.363
to a "Brown Eyes
Wide Shut" party.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.432
Geez, I don't know what's
going on with him.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.568
But I guess love does
funny things to people.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.936
Look at Forrest Gump.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.537
Hi, Forrest.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.873
I know you just got back
from Vietnam and you love me,

12:21.875 --> 12:23.608
but I'm gonna go run a train

12:23.610 --> 12:25.610
with this group
of Black Panthers I just met.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.612
Okay, Jenny.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.114
Hi, Forrest.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.349
I know you came all this way
to New York to visit me,

12:31.351 --> 12:32.684
but I'm gonna go do blow

12:32.686 --> 12:34.352
and have sex
with a bunch of stockbrokers.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.287
Okay, Jenny.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.522
Hi, Forrest.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.057
Now that I have
the most contagious

12:39.059 --> 12:41.059
and incurable disease
known to mankind,

12:41.061 --> 12:42.961
I'll finally have pity sex
with you.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.729
Okay, Jenny.

12:44.731 --> 12:48.366
And I'll mow the grass
and raise the AIDS baby.

12:51.237 --> 12:52.570
SONJA:
Hey, sexy.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.806
Sonja, what are you doing here?

12:54.808 --> 12:57.475
Well, I got tired of waiting
for you to get home,

12:57.477 --> 12:59.577
so I thought I'd come to you.

12:59.579 --> 13:00.812
Come on, Sonja. How about...

13:00.814 --> 13:02.280
how about
we take a night off, huh?

13:02.282 --> 13:03.715
The sex has just been nonstop.

13:03.717 --> 13:06.417
I mean, I understand
that "no" doesn't mean "no,"

13:06.419 --> 13:09.020
but certainly some word
has got to mean "no."

13:12.258 --> 13:13.958
This is one of your
fantasies, right?

13:13.960 --> 13:16.127
Public humiliation?

13:16.129 --> 13:18.997
Mm, it's sexy, isn't it?

13:19.965 --> 13:21.166
(cries out)

13:21.168 --> 13:22.634
(crying)
Sonja, stop, please!

13:22.636 --> 13:25.336
Come on, you love it.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.809
Ow! Ow! Ow!

13:30.811 --> 13:33.344
You're hurting me, and I really
need to clean out my trunk!

13:33.346 --> 13:35.180
Oh, I'm gonna clean
out your trunk.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.447
Giggity.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.950
That's my word. That's my word!

13:38.952 --> 13:41.686
(muffled screaming)

13:43.789 --> 13:46.324
Okay, Joe, Joe,
you're drunk, okay?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.426
You're drunk;
give me your keys.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.762
And-and I'm drunk,
so I'll give you my keys.

13:50.764 --> 13:54.098
Okay, now we're both good
to drive home.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.804
You been drinking
tonight, sir?

13:59.806 --> 14:03.374
Uh, no, Officer, I just had
a glass of dinner with my wine.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.710
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the car

14:05.712 --> 14:08.046
and walk a straight
line, please.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.481
All right,
you be safe, sir.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.750
There's a lot of crazies
out there tonight.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.558
(doorbell rings)

14:21.827 --> 14:23.695
Oh, hey, Mr. and
Mrs. Quagmire.

14:23.697 --> 14:24.896
Hi, Peter.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.231
I'm a little worried
about Glenn.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.899
I haven't heard
from him in days.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.067
Have you seen him?

14:29.069 --> 14:30.335
I haven't seen anybody.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.036
I've been grounded
for pinching a girl.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.172
Hey, are you guys talking
about Quagmire?

14:34.174 --> 14:35.740
He never showed
this morning,

14:35.742 --> 14:38.509
and today's the day
we usually go apple picking.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.911
Get that one.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.045
Get that one!

14:41.047 --> 14:42.413
Hey, get that one.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.748
Get that one over there.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.483
No, not-not that one.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.018
I already got it!
I can't put it back!

14:47.020 --> 14:48.586
Well, it's not
going in the pie.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.321
Well, if you're so smart,
why don't you come up here

14:50.323 --> 14:51.389
and pick them yourself?

14:51.391 --> 14:53.491
And now there's
no pie at all.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.026
I've already checked
Glenn's house,

14:55.028 --> 14:56.694
and there's no sign
he's even been there.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.696
I'm afraid something terrible
has happened.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.498
Now let's not jump
to any conclusions.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.400
I'm sure if we just check
his usual hangouts,

15:02.402 --> 15:03.935
someone will have seen him.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.403
Wait a second.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.105
He hangs out at the Clam
with some fat loudmouth.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.574
You find Loudy McFatass,
you find Quagmire.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.009
Come on, let's go.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.877
But, Dad, it's the
night of my big show!

15:12.879 --> 15:16.814
Oh, Chris, I was never
gonna go to that.

15:20.052 --> 15:21.753
We should get some food
in you, mister.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.621
You hardly ate
any of that cereal

15:23.623 --> 15:25.089
I smashed
on your mouth yesterday.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.724
(gasps)
Brian?

15:26.726 --> 15:28.526
Oh, hey.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.094
What the hell are you doing?

15:30.096 --> 15:32.397
Oh, I've been kind of using
Rupert as a chew toy.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.765
Chewing him
with your crotch?

15:33.767 --> 15:35.566
Hey, dogs like humping
stuffed animals.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.801
What can I say?

15:36.803 --> 15:38.202
Besides, you said
I could have Rupert.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.938
I thought you liked
Oscar better anyway.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.406
Well, I just changed my mind.

15:41.408 --> 15:44.142
And you know Rupert's a dude,
right, you gaylord?

15:46.812 --> 15:49.247
Okay, you guys, where should
we start looking for Glenn?

15:49.249 --> 15:51.149
Well, sometimes Quagmire
likes to hang out

15:51.151 --> 15:52.917
under all the clutter
in my garage.

15:52.919 --> 15:55.219
So, why don't we
just start sorting stuff

15:55.221 --> 15:56.721
and throwing stuff away

15:56.723 --> 15:57.956
but obviously checking
with me first

15:57.958 --> 15:59.157
before you throw stuff away.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.758
No problem, Peter.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.827
Quagmire, if you're in
there, hang tight, buddy.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.295
We're coming.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.897
Right, and if we can't
find him in here,

16:05.899 --> 16:07.298
he sometimes likes to hang out

16:07.300 --> 16:09.167
in between the blades
of grass in my lawn.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.669
And also in the firewood
that needs to be split.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.638
Might he be under the leaves
in your gutter?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.006
Great question,
and yes, he might.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.908
So, while you guys
are taking care of that,

16:16.910 --> 16:18.810
I'll be around back
flicking pinecones

16:18.812 --> 16:20.878
at a tree
with this hockey stick.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.285
Aloha.
Welcome to Ryan's Hawaiians.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.653
Hey, how you doing?

16:28.655 --> 16:29.787
Amazing.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.155
Have you seen this man?

16:31.157 --> 16:32.623
Glenn Quagmire?

16:32.625 --> 16:34.993
Nah, the last time I saw him
was three months ago.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.761
Sold him 70 red shirts.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.763
Yeah, he does look
good in that shirt.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.865
Uh, everyone looks good
in my shirts.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.300
How about you, Big Island?

16:42.302 --> 16:43.634
Uh, I don't know.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.303
Do you want to be
an oldies' DJ

16:45.305 --> 16:46.971
or a 1980's wrestling manager?

16:46.973 --> 16:48.506
Yes, both.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.875
This is beautiful.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.510
Heart disease looks better

16:52.512 --> 16:55.246
when it's wrapped in a
tropical, floral pattern.

16:58.217 --> 16:59.984
Oh, my God, this is hopeless.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.819
We've been searching for hours.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.287
Glenn could be dead by now.

17:03.289 --> 17:05.289
I know, and if you guys
are really hungry,

17:05.291 --> 17:06.357
I suppose I could eat.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.658
Come on, we can't give up.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.360
Someone's got to
have seen Quagmire.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.962
Or if not him,
at least Sonja.

17:10.964 --> 17:13.031
Excuse me, did you
just say "Sonja"?

17:13.033 --> 17:14.165
Yes! I did!

17:14.167 --> 17:15.466
That was my dog's name.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.802
Excuse me,
did he just say "Sonja"?

17:17.804 --> 17:19.070
Yeah, it was his dog's name.

17:19.072 --> 17:21.072
Oh, I thought
he might have been talking

17:21.074 --> 17:23.141
about this super kinky woman
who's always down here,

17:23.143 --> 17:25.043
trying to lure men
to her sex slave shed.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.011
No, I think he was talking
about his dog.

17:27.013 --> 17:29.213
No, Peter, that's the
Sonja we're looking for.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.315
Sonja must have
taken Glenn there.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.051
Where exactly is
this sex slave shed?

17:33.053 --> 17:34.419
I'm not sure,

17:34.421 --> 17:36.320
but I've heard she has a unit
at Quahog Storage.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.589
Apparently that chick's
a complete psycho.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.757
We got to get over there!

17:39.759 --> 17:41.559
Come on, you guys,
let's go!

17:41.561 --> 17:44.062
Oh, man, I hope we don't catch
them doing something freaky.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.997
I'm still weirded out
from when I walked in

17:45.999 --> 17:47.732
on that masturbating Eskimo.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.034
Dinner time, Tikaloo.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.235
Oh, my God!

17:51.237 --> 17:53.237
Doesn't anybody knock?

17:55.941 --> 17:59.177
Hey, Stewie, look, I want
to apologize about earlier.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.778
What the hell is this?

18:00.780 --> 18:03.548
Brian, I think it's time
that Rupert made his choice.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.882
What are you talking about?

18:04.884 --> 18:06.217
Talking about love, Bri.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.852
Talking about adult decisions.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.921
Rupert's been with me,
and now he's been with you.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.622
It's time for him to pick.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.691
Stewie, this is stupid;
I'm not doing this.

18:13.693 --> 18:17.195
Brian, either you cooperate or I
blow my Adam Levine dog whistle.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.130
Hey, my voice isn't that high.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.264
It is.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.566
It is though.

18:21.568 --> 18:22.767
All right, Rupert.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.801
Who will it be?

18:23.803 --> 18:25.136
And before you answer,

18:25.138 --> 18:26.971
think of all the
good times we've had.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.307
The time we met The Beatles
on   <i>The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

18:29.309 --> 18:32.110
That winter we lived
on the sun.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.377
And here's my favorite.

18:33.379 --> 18:36.280
A blank one we can fill up

18:36.282 --> 18:38.816
with a future together.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.923
Yes!

18:45.925 --> 18:48.126
Oh, my God, Rupert, I'm
so sorry for everything!

18:48.128 --> 18:49.594
I missed you, too!

18:49.596 --> 18:50.928
Whatever.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.164
Hey, you done
with that weird octopus doll?

18:54.433 --> 18:56.667
It's you and me forever, Rupert.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.737
I just hope Oscar
didn't take it too hard.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.181
This is it, number 92.

19:10.183 --> 19:11.916
This is Sonja's
storage unit.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.085
Quagmire, are you in there?

19:14.087 --> 19:15.953
(muffled screaming)

19:15.955 --> 19:17.288
Oh, he's eating.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.857
We'll come back
when you're done eating.

19:26.131 --> 19:27.165
Glenn!

19:27.167 --> 19:28.599
Hurry, she'll be back soon.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.434
I can't believe the
guy with the ponytail

19:30.436 --> 19:32.103
and the facial tattoo
at the front desk

19:32.105 --> 19:33.337
would let this happen.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.139
SONJA:
Well, what's this?

19:35.141 --> 19:36.774
We got company?

19:36.776 --> 19:38.209
Hold it right there.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.343
Please.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.145
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

19:41.147 --> 19:42.446
Boy, if you were
ever gonna stand,

19:42.448 --> 19:44.615
this would be
the time, Joe.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.150
Everybody, just shut up!

19:46.152 --> 19:49.153
You idiots should've
minded your own business.

19:49.155 --> 19:50.288
This is our business.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.722
You kidnapped our friend.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.224
You're going to jail.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.126
Don't come any closer
or I'll shoot you!

19:55.128 --> 19:57.161
Oh, I don't think
you're gonna shoot me.

19:57.163 --> 19:58.563
You don't got the boobs.

19:58.565 --> 19:59.697
What?

19:59.699 --> 20:00.831
I-I don't know.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.700
Now, just hand me
the gun, Sonja.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.036
Oh, I swear to God,
you get one inch closer to me,

20:05.038 --> 20:06.404
and I'm gonna shoot you.

20:09.741 --> 20:10.975
(gun clicking)

20:10.977 --> 20:12.476
What the hell?

20:13.545 --> 20:15.346
Like I said, you're
going to jail.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.048
Oh, my God, Joe,
that was so close.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.716
How'd you know the
gun would jam?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.151
It didn't jam, Peter.

20:20.153 --> 20:21.485
The gun was never loaded.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.688
Sort of had
a mental breakdown in April.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.690
No more bullets for this guy.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.892
Oh, Glenn, I was so
worried about you.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.927
Are you all right?
No, no,

20:29.929 --> 20:32.196
I'm pretty (bleep) far
from all right.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.665
Well, I guess this is
as good a time as any.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.567
Happy birthday, Joe.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.236
You dick!

20:41.573 --> 20:42.907
Thanks for your help, guys.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.709
I might not be alive
if it weren't for you.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.210
Hey, no problem, buddy.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.279
Yeah, you would've done the
same for us, Quagmire.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.181
You know, I guess
what I realized from all this

20:50.183 --> 20:51.849
is that when it comes
to relationships,

20:51.851 --> 20:53.417
I need to be the kinky one.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.620
Ah, we're just glad
to have you back, Quagmire.

20:55.622 --> 20:59.190
Yep, and it's good to put
all those troubles behind us.

20:59.192 --> 21:01.292
My dad told me
he's pregnant.
