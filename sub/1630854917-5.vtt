02:02.200 --> 02:04.880
- Hey.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.640
What's going on?

02:07.640 --> 02:09.640
You collapsed.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.040
- What are you doing?
-  It's fine.

02:21.040 --> 02:25.040
- There it is.

02:30.480 --> 02:33.440
-  Sienna.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.040
Sienna you...

02:40.880 --> 02:44.840
- The baby's perfect.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.680
I'm pregnant.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.480
No.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.440
It's not a good thing.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
I can't do it. No.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.080
I need your help.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.080
Who is that?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.800
What is she staring at?

04:38.760 --> 04:40.600
What are you
staring at?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.160
I'm talking to my mom.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.320
Just mind your own business, okay?

04:51.240 --> 04:53.040
What is your problem?

05:06.920 --> 05:08.920
Where did you get this?

05:09.680 --> 05:11.480
Who did this to you?

05:15.080 --> 05:17.800
Base...

05:20.160 --> 05:21.240
Basement.

05:21.240 --> 05:24.520
-  Sienna.

05:25.360 --> 05:29.600
Come.
We need to finish your examination.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.920
No, no, I'm done.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
- What did you say to her?

07:02.400 --> 07:04.280
Ah!

08:06.400 --> 08:07.960
What is this?

08:07.960 --> 08:09.800
It's an eviction notice.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.480
Yes, your house.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.960
- My house.
- Your house.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.760
Why?

08:22.760 --> 08:24.720
Themba signed over the land to Rudy.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.200
Everybody has to leave
by this evening.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.000
Oh, Themba.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.960
- What is this?
- This is R10,000.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.320
Every household here has
been offered R20,000.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.000
Provided that you leave
here by this evening.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.360
R10,000 on the spot now and
10,000 once you've been removed.

08:51.360 --> 08:54.120
- Take it.
- Mm-mm.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.000
Siphiwe?

11:02.320 --> 11:04.160
Siphiwe?

11:35.720 --> 11:37.240
-  I was worried about you.
-  I'm fine.

11:37.240 --> 11:38.360
Yeah,
but you should have called me.

11:38.360 --> 11:41.200
Dirk.
I think this is where Yola was.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.840
They did something to her
and that is why she can't remember.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.640
You need to find out what is going on
and check the basement.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.600
The stress is not good for you,
the baby--

11:48.600 --> 11:50.480
Dirk, Yola was here.

11:51.080 --> 11:55.480
You need to find out what they did
to her and what is in the basement.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.440
Please.

11:58.880 --> 12:02.120
Okay, I'll do it.
But you need a rest, huh?

12:02.560 --> 12:04.600
And you need to do your job.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.240
-  And the baby?
-  He's fine.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.720
-  It's a boy?
-  Hm!

12:16.720 --> 12:19.200
-  Where is she?
-  At home.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.280
But she called Dirk
to investigate the hospital.

12:21.280 --> 12:25.160
- Crap that's all I need.
- What are you complaining about now?

12:25.160 --> 12:27.280
Besides the two dead members
of the fathers.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.880
The town in panic,
made worse by your stupid,

12:29.880 --> 12:32.040
superstitious ramblings
about a mythic monster.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.160
Oh, and a bunch of diamonds
lying around

12:34.160 --> 12:35.600
waiting for someone else
to pick them up.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.920
And what's stopping
you from picking them up?

12:37.920 --> 12:41.840
Fucking Lindiwe and that friend
of hers, they refused to leave.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.080
And now this.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.640
Oh, they were very happy
to take the cash.

12:45.640 --> 12:48.440
Which they won't get if
she doesn't move. Right?

12:48.440 --> 12:51.160
All of them have to
leave or the deal's off.

12:57.240 --> 13:00.800
Leave it to me. Just deal with Dirk.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.280
I'll deal with Lindiwe and by
tomorrow she'll be off the land.

13:04.280 --> 13:07.680
- And you, off your pity pot.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.960
Yola.
What are you doing here?

13:34.760 --> 13:36.480
Is she real?

13:42.480 --> 13:44.840
-  Yes.
-  Yes.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.240
Like in the flesh.
Have you actually seen her?

13:49.440 --> 13:52.840
- Do you know the story of this land?
- I've heard it told, yes.

13:52.840 --> 13:55.640
-  By a white man?
- My dad.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.360
You see...

14:01.200 --> 14:05.240
Your great ancestor,
Jacob the Elder.

14:07.960 --> 14:10.640
And then cut off
from the travelling party.

14:10.640 --> 14:13.520
They got sick. Malaria.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.000
His wife and child died.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.800
And then he stumbled
into the Black Rock Valley.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.120
Lay dying in the stream.

14:24.440 --> 14:29.320
And then this young girl,
Lukhanyo, found him...

14:29.920 --> 14:32.480
and nursed him back into health.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.680
And he raped her.

14:37.400 --> 14:42.960
She miscarried. In this dream
she cried the stream into a river.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.200
You see Mamlambo...

14:47.200 --> 14:50.640
is that unsettled spirit
of that child.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.280
So she's a spirit?

14:55.760 --> 14:58.760
- Yes.
- I thought you said she was real.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.360
Yola.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.880
I think I've seen her.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.720
Or felt her, I'm not sure any more.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.280
That makes sense.

15:18.280 --> 15:22.320
- What does?
- You, seeing her.

15:24.360 --> 15:28.640
- Why?
- She's come full circle.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.760
She is your ancestor.

18:43.160 --> 18:44.960
Majola?

18:46.920 --> 18:48.520
Your great...

20:20.240 --> 20:22.040
Hm.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.720
Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.960
Hey, hey! Okay, okay, okay.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.160
We can now-- Okay. Okay.

20:36.160 --> 20:39.200
Now, we can all sleep peacefully, yeah?

20:41.360 --> 20:44.200
Our kids can play outside
on the streets.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.880
Max, Max, Max!

20:52.320 --> 20:54.040
Hold-- Hold that thought.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.840
Ag, nee.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.560
- Hey, beautiful. How are you doing?
- Hi. Yeah.

20:59.560 --> 21:02.200
Huh? I went by the house last
night to see if you were okay.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.960
- Everything good?
- Yeah.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.640
- Oh.
- Sorry I was exhausted.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.840
- Oh!
- I was out like a light.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.360
- Okay.
-  Guys, guys, guys.

21:08.360 --> 21:09.800
Come, come, come, come, come.
Let me take a photo

21:09.800 --> 21:11.040
of you with the crocodile.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.280
- Yeah, if you--
-  Come on.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.080
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah? Okay, okay.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.880
Okay. Okay.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.160
Alright. Break it up.
Break it up. Get out of here.

21:18.160 --> 21:21.160
It's my crocodile, I killed
the thing. Oh...

21:22.960 --> 21:25.800
- Get in. Get in.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.680
- Yes.
-  Max, Max, Max!

21:29.640 --> 21:31.320
Ag, nee.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.640
So, that was the kitchen
and the scullery.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.840
And this is
the patient's common room,

21:40.840 --> 21:43.160
where they do all
kinds of activities

21:43.160 --> 21:45.520
to help their process
of healing along.

21:51.160 --> 21:54.760
Well, that about covers it.
You've now seen everything.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.440
Whoa. Everything?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.600
Except the emergency
generator outside.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.960
- What about the basement?
- There is no basement.

22:08.200 --> 22:12.160
-  Is that true? Show it to me.
- We don't have a basement.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.640
Able, hi.
We're gonna need a search warrant.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.440
Okay, put that away.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.480
Come.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.880
-  God.
- I'm so sorry.

23:30.480 --> 23:32.520
So sorry.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.040
If there's anything you need.

23:35.720 --> 23:37.560
You let me know, okay?

23:38.240 --> 23:40.280
Hey!

23:40.280 --> 23:44.480
So a-- Yeah, I think it's
time for a celebration. Huh?

23:44.920 --> 23:46.840
- Sounds great.
- Yeah.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.640
Okay. Well, tonight then.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.600
- My place, braai.
- Yeah.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.320
- I'll be there.
- Great.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.560
Call a meeting.

24:11.320 --> 24:15.320
That thing didn't kill them.
It only ate her leftovers.

24:17.120 --> 24:19.080
She's not done yet.

24:21.680 --> 24:24.880
We have a young woman in
here who accused her uncle of rape.

24:24.880 --> 24:28.480
My treatment helped us to
erase her memory of the event.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.800
- Erase it?
- As if it never happened.

24:32.280 --> 24:36.120
-  But what if it did happen?
- You're asking the wrong question.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.480
Oh, what is the right question?

24:39.480 --> 24:41.800
Her uncle
is a very powerful man.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.280
Yeah, and?

24:43.280 --> 24:46.600
Imagine the anarchy
if her accusations became public.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.960
But that doesn't mean
that she wasn't raped.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.240
Well, she probably was.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
But you're missing my point.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.560
What is your point?

24:56.560 --> 25:00.880
I can single-handedly halve
the country's rape statistics.

25:01.520 --> 25:05.560
We can go from being a pariah.
The rape capital of the world,

25:05.560 --> 25:09.520
to a leading light in the fight
against gender violence.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.240
By wiping victims' memories
of their rape?

25:18.040 --> 25:20.120
That's what happened to Yola,
isn't it?

25:21.360 --> 25:23.160
Huh?

25:26.600 --> 25:28.480
You raped her.

25:29.880 --> 25:31.480
And you brought her here
to be wiped.

25:31.480 --> 25:34.520
Stop acting innocent.
You slipped her the drink.

25:37.960 --> 25:40.840
At a dam. Don't you remember?

25:44.800 --> 25:46.760
What the--
The flask that you gave me.

25:46.760 --> 25:49.800
Yeah. It's got your
fingerprints all over it.

25:49.800 --> 25:54.440
-  You said it was tea.
- It was, with a touch of Dormicum.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.200
You can never make it stick.

26:03.200 --> 26:06.600
I don't need to make it stick.
I just need Sienna to believe it.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.840
- I will not be blackmailed.

26:11.720 --> 26:14.240
Well, if you say a word
of this to anyone,

26:14.240 --> 26:18.360
I've got five people that'll say
that not only did you drug Yola,

26:18.360 --> 26:20.800
but you took part
in the ritual with us.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.720
So my friend Annie

26:32.720 --> 26:36.200
told me what happened to you
outside of a shop the other day.

26:37.280 --> 26:39.120
Why didn't you tell me?

26:39.640 --> 26:41.920
You know you can tell me anything.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.080
Hm.

26:52.080 --> 26:53.880
She was nearly killed, ma'am.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.200
That witch Lindiwe
and her sidekick Qaqamba

26:56.200 --> 26:58.760
put a spell on the raincoat
and it nearly killed her.

26:58.760 --> 27:02.120
- She couldn't breathe.
- Have you told your parents?

27:04.680 --> 27:08.800
- Why not?
- My mother and Lindiwe are friends.

27:13.320 --> 27:16.840
She said that she was... possessed.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.920
And what if it happens again...

27:21.480 --> 27:23.160
to someone else?

27:24.520 --> 27:26.720
You wouldn't want that, would you?

27:29.360 --> 27:31.280
- No, ma'am.
- No.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.400
So you need to warn them.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.240
Do the right thing.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.520
There is no basement.

27:40.520 --> 27:42.240
What hospital doesn't have
a basement?

27:42.240 --> 27:43.280
This one.

27:43.280 --> 27:45.240
And the woman with the mark
on the side of her head.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.160
Ah, Sie-- It's just a mark.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.920
And the fact that Yola
has the exact same mark.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.880
Come, look. Come.

27:54.880 --> 27:57.160
Yola please can I show
Dirk something?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.800
Look.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.400
I can't see anything.

28:03.800 --> 28:06.000
Okay, well,
it's healed but it was there.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.520
Sien--
Sienna, I did what you asked, okay?

28:09.480 --> 28:12.520
I did a thorough check of the
hospital and I didn't find anything.

28:12.520 --> 28:15.840
- But she was there.
- No, Sienna, she wasn't.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.360
Okay, well,
so now you're just gonna go?

28:21.360 --> 28:22.960
Yes, I'm gonna go.

28:23.400 --> 28:26.920
Because I can't just be at your
beck and call whenever you choose.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.760
I have a job to do and...

28:29.760 --> 28:31.080
This doesn't work for me.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.920
Well,
this doesn't work for me either.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.040
I think you were at Fort Vandenberg

28:38.040 --> 28:41.240
and they did something to you
and that's why you can't remember.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.560
They're hiding something.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.560
Don't go to the braai tonight.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.960
Sienna doesn't think
I should go.

30:50.960 --> 30:53.640
Don't let your sister spoil
your fun.

30:56.960 --> 30:59.040
I don't know who I can trust.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.720
Mm-hm.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.160
Yes, that's true.

31:09.320 --> 31:14.280
But did she also tell you
that it was her

31:14.280 --> 31:18.120
who had you institutionalised after
your father's funeral?

31:23.680 --> 31:25.480
I didn't think so.

31:45.400 --> 31:48.840
Now... close your eyes.

31:49.800 --> 31:53.480
In order to forget,
we need to remember.

31:54.800 --> 31:59.760
Tell me what happened last year
on the night of the Spring Festival.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.240
The last time I saw
you was at the festival.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.480
I was so happy.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.840
Well, you were so happy.

32:07.840 --> 32:10.800
I was the spring princess.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.600
And having a good time.

32:14.040 --> 32:16.480
And then I was told that
you disappeared.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.520
Sienna was very worried.

32:18.520 --> 32:22.200
So I got in my car and I drove
to the dam and I looked for you.

32:22.840 --> 32:27.160
I went out there every day,
looking for you.

32:27.920 --> 32:30.960
There were no clues. Like you...

32:31.520 --> 32:34.200
You just vanished into thin air.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.920
And this went on for weeks.

32:37.960 --> 32:41.160
That's when I... started losing hope.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.280
I thought I wasn't gonna see
you again.

32:47.440 --> 32:50.000
I thought I'd never be
able to tell you how I...

32:55.280 --> 32:57.120
Let me...

32:58.000 --> 32:59.640
show you this.

33:05.880 --> 33:08.120
I kept this in my-- my pocket...

33:08.960 --> 33:10.880
every day. Um...

33:13.360 --> 33:15.520
Do you remember that night?

33:19.160 --> 33:23.640
Hm? You do? Yeah?

33:26.920 --> 33:28.880
You left shortly after.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.480
And I...

33:34.560 --> 33:37.000
told myself it wasn't meant to be.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.760
It was just bad timing.

33:42.480 --> 33:45.920
And then you came back,
for your father's funeral.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.080
I couldn't believe my luck.

33:50.760 --> 33:54.200
I can't believe you're here,
with me, right now.

33:55.240 --> 33:59.240
- Cooking this crocodile.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.960
I'm sorry.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.600
I guess what I'm trying to say is, Yola...

34:08.040 --> 34:11.240
would you please go to the
dance with me tomorrow night?

34:11.880 --> 34:14.360
You'd make me
the happiest person alive.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.640
Hm.

34:20.760 --> 34:23.360
So when were you going
to tell me that you're pregnant?

34:23.360 --> 34:25.000
I wasn't.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.800
Well, it's my child,
you know that.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.920
No, Rudy, it's not.

34:28.920 --> 34:32.040
Seriously, Sienna, that
fucking guy can't blow up a balloon.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.840
It's not his either.

34:35.040 --> 34:38.960
- Oh? Who else are you sleeping with?
- It's mine.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.760
I'm not having it.

34:41.760 --> 34:44.000
But you can't decide to kill
our child on your own.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.360
- It is not even a child yet.
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.320
I want to have this baby with you.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.480
We can start fresh. We can go...

34:53.480 --> 34:56.800
Rudy, how do you see
this panning out?

34:56.800 --> 34:58.400
Seriously, go. What?

34:58.400 --> 35:01.000
You, Grace and me
and all our children,

35:01.000 --> 35:03.320
playing happy family
and one wife can cook for you,

35:03.320 --> 35:04.360
and the other one can clean,

35:04.360 --> 35:06.640
and we can both take
turns jerking you off.

35:06.640 --> 35:09.280
In what fucking world
are you living in?

35:09.280 --> 35:11.080
You made your choice.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.560
Now go.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.040
I'm hungry.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.600
Mmm.

36:14.440 --> 36:18.800
We, your believers,
know that we have angered you.

36:19.880 --> 36:24.200
Others credit your work
to that of a lowly reptile.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.280
A bottom feeder.

36:28.160 --> 36:33.600
But we are awed
by your majesty and power.

36:34.920 --> 36:37.560
And ask for your forgiveness.

36:54.040 --> 36:56.520
Charlton. Charlton.

36:57.320 --> 37:01.040
You need to get to my aunt's house,
Lindiwe, right now.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.840
They're going to kill her.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.960
They'll burn down my house, man. Please.

37:06.960 --> 37:09.960
Charlton. Listen to me.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.720
Get to Lindiwe's house.

37:13.280 --> 37:14.840
Save her. Save her. You owe me this.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.840
Save her. You owe me this.

37:17.720 --> 37:20.920
You owe me this. Go. Now, Charlton.

37:48.800 --> 37:53.880
We humbly ask you
to accept our small token.

37:55.040 --> 37:59.520
And promise to bring
to you the blood of Jacob.

38:04.280 --> 38:09.360
To balance the scales.
To right the wrongs of the past.

38:10.360 --> 38:14.400
And form a harmonious alliance
between us...

38:15.560 --> 38:19.480
so that we can go together
into the future.

38:21.840 --> 38:23.520
Hear us.

39:01.240 --> 39:03.400
What's going on? What are--
What are you doing?

39:03.400 --> 39:05.720
- No, stop. No, stop! Whoa, stop!

39:05.720 --> 39:08.840
Someone-- Someone's gonna die.
You can't be doing this.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.280
Save...

40:33.880 --> 40:36.440
Ah!

40:58.400 --> 41:00.200
Hear us.

41:36.800 --> 41:39.600
-  It's okay.

42:22.120 --> 42:23.960
Clara?
