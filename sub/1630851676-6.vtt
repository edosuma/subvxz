ROBYN:
This is Melody,

00:09.509 --> 00:10.710
one of my oldest friends.

00:10.777 --> 00:12.679
You had me at "risky."
What's the plan?

00:12.746 --> 00:15.081
ROBYN:
How's it going, Harry?
Enjoying being dead?

00:15.148 --> 00:16.116
HARRY:
Five years of being

00:16.182 --> 00:18.017
stuck underground--
it's getting a little old.

00:18.084 --> 00:18.685
(alarm beeping)

00:22.155 --> 00:23.623
I'm asking, Rob,

00:23.690 --> 00:24.758
help me live again.

00:24.824 --> 00:26.092
This isn't right. I'm a cop.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.694
You'll have your moment.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.029
But right now, it's my turn.

00:41.641 --> 00:43.376
For now.

00:43.443 --> 00:44.677
Happy to help.

00:44.744 --> 00:45.712
Heard about Delilah.

00:45.779 --> 00:46.679
What happened
to her friend--

00:46.746 --> 00:47.347
that's a terrible thing.

00:46.746 --> 00:47.347

So I heard.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.964
What you didn't hear

is that,
after the first shooting,

05:33.800 --> 05:35.368
a demand came in.

05:35.435 --> 05:37.370
He wants $30 million

05:37.437 --> 05:39.072
or-- and I quote--

05:39.138 --> 05:41.074
"New York
will be raining bodies."

05:41.140 --> 05:44.010
Which leaves you,
the mayor and the city

05:44.077 --> 05:45.078
in a no-win situation.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.549
You don't pay, the killings
continue. You pay and...

05:49.615 --> 05:52.618
It's open season for anyone
with a gun looking for a payday.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.087
Which is why I came to you.

05:54.153 --> 05:55.855
The only way out

05:55.922 --> 05:59.559

and take him down.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.128

We haven't even been able
to firmly identify

06:11.204 --> 06:12.138
where he's shooting from.

07:03.122 --> 07:04.891

(sighs)
The City of New York.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.162
Grafton came to me personally.

07:09.228 --> 07:10.596
Needs our help

07:10.663 --> 07:12.165
finding a sniper.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.165
Wait, seriously?

07:12.231 --> 07:13.766
One second you're behind
bars, the next second

07:13.833 --> 07:15.034
she's your client?
That's not weird.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.171
It gets even weirder. We have
the full cooperation of NYPD.

07:18.237 --> 07:19.906
Expect a data dump soon.

07:19.972 --> 07:22.575
Cops think the killings
are random, but...

07:22.642 --> 07:23.743
All right, you
want me to dig deep,

07:23.810 --> 07:24.877
look for potential patterns.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.746
Yeah. And, Mel,

07:26.813 --> 07:28.748
I'm gonna need
your shooter's eye.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.750
Takes a thief to catch a thief.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.552
Can you meet me where
the last victim was killed?

07:32.618 --> 07:33.820
Yeah.
I'm on my way.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.927
Projectile hit the seated vic,

07:40.993 --> 07:42.595
then struck the concrete.

07:42.662 --> 07:44.030
Given the angle,

07:44.096 --> 07:47.200
NYPD thinks
the shot came from over...

07:47.266 --> 07:48.601
there. Tenth floor.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.803
They combed the place,

07:50.870 --> 07:52.905
but they didn't
find a nest.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.941
What time was
the shooting? Exactly.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.609
8:37 a.m.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.678
What you thinking?

07:58.744 --> 08:01.747
Thinking the shot could've come
from any one of those buildings.

08:01.814 --> 08:02.715
But given the position

08:02.782 --> 08:04.617
of the sun,
you'd have reflective flares.

08:04.684 --> 08:06.819
Plus, there's
way too much open space

08:06.886 --> 08:09.589
to dampen the noise.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.190
Someone would've clocked
the location of a shot

08:11.257 --> 08:13.259
that close.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.828
All right. Me?

08:15.895 --> 08:18.030
I'd give it more space.

08:18.097 --> 08:20.666
Anything over 500 yards,
you'd have variables,

08:20.733 --> 08:23.903
like gravity, the
Coriolis effect. But...

08:23.970 --> 08:25.571
for a cleaner
escape route,

08:25.638 --> 08:28.941
there's a tactically better,
albeit

08:29.008 --> 08:32.044
far more difficult, shot.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.145
Where?

08:33.813 --> 08:35.848
NYPD thinks it's over there.

08:35.915 --> 08:37.750
It's actually way over there.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.923
'Cause it's not just
about taking a shot.

08:43.990 --> 08:46.559
It's about being able
to get in and get out

08:46.626 --> 08:47.760
without being detected.

08:49.896 --> 08:52.531
From that distance,

08:52.598 --> 08:55.201
he could see people coming
and be gone before they arrived.

08:55.268 --> 08:59.071
Rob, a person capable
of making that shot

08:59.138 --> 09:00.907
is no ordinary sniper.

09:00.973 --> 09:02.675
I mean, we are
talking someone

09:02.742 --> 09:04.143
with a truly elite skill set.

09:04.210 --> 09:07.713
Someone trained to kill
and disappear.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.185
Unless we
find them...

09:15.121 --> 09:17.089
A lot more people are gonna die.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.131
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

09:32.338 --> 09:34.607
Great.

09:34.674 --> 09:35.942
They found the sniper's nest,

09:36.008 --> 09:37.176
right where you said
it would be.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.678
(exhales)

09:38.744 --> 09:39.712
HARRY:
That's why the cops

09:39.779 --> 09:40.680
couldn't find the other two.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.715
They didn't realize
how good this guy was.

09:42.782 --> 09:46.185
Applying the same logic to
the previous two shootings,

09:46.252 --> 09:48.120
I'd place the perches...

09:48.187 --> 09:49.889
here.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.724
And...

09:51.791 --> 09:54.060
here.

09:54.126 --> 09:56.829
Harry, did you find any
connections between the victims?

09:56.896 --> 09:58.831
No. I combed through
all their histories.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.166
There's no intersections.

10:00.232 --> 10:01.867
Well, if the vics
aren't related,

10:01.934 --> 10:03.002
maybe these buildings are.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.137
You find anything else
at the perch?

10:05.204 --> 10:06.205
Some pencil markings
on the wall.

10:08.674 --> 10:10.676
Shooter's last-minute
calculations, maybe?

10:08.674 --> 10:10.676
Let me see.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.347
Thanks. Uh...

10:14.413 --> 10:16.248
Oh, God.

10:14.413 --> 10:16.248
What?

10:16.315 --> 10:19.352
These formulas--
every sniper uses them, but...

10:19.418 --> 10:22.388
I only know one person
who teaches this variation.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.023
Oh, wait, not...

10:24.090 --> 10:25.391
Yeah.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.391
The guy who...

10:25.458 --> 10:27.226
Yeah.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.861
W... No, hold up.

10:28.928 --> 10:30.196
You're not gonna go see
this guy.

10:30.262 --> 10:31.797
What choice do I have?

10:31.864 --> 10:34.133
It's like purposely
stepping on a land mine.

10:31.864 --> 10:34.133
Yeah.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.801
But if he's the person
who trained the shooter,

10:35.868 --> 10:37.336
I don't have a choice.

10:37.403 --> 10:38.804
♪ ♪

10:44.076 --> 10:46.779
Come on.
Crisp up on that target.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.881
Now cant your scope
to the reticle

10:48.948 --> 10:51.283
and work up and down
from the tallest position.

10:53.052 --> 10:54.020
(gunshot)

10:54.086 --> 10:55.021
There you go.

10:55.087 --> 10:56.355
Center mass.

10:59.425 --> 11:00.893
Airman Bayani.

11:02.728 --> 11:05.197
You know, think you might have
made a wrong turn,

11:05.264 --> 11:06.832
'cause this-this range
is for shooters

11:06.899 --> 11:08.200
who know how
to pull the trigger.

11:08.267 --> 11:10.036
Well, I guess some things
never change.

11:10.102 --> 11:13.005
Look, as much
as it pains me, Erickson,

11:13.072 --> 11:14.440
I'm here because
I need your help.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.142
Well, I can't help the helpless.

11:16.208 --> 11:19.345
I'm working for the NYPD.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.313
On the sniper case.

11:21.380 --> 11:24.450
(laughs)

11:24.517 --> 11:26.852
And-and they asked you?

11:28.187 --> 11:29.855
(gunshot)

11:29.922 --> 11:32.725
Well, uh, I guess we can
rule you out as the shooter.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.894
You're not getting away
from anyone with that limp.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.096
Yeah, well.
Badge of honor, Bayani.

11:37.163 --> 11:39.098
You wouldn't understand.

11:37.163 --> 11:39.098
(gunshot)

11:40.433 --> 11:42.468
You know, in the, uh,

11:42.535 --> 11:44.804
in the spirit of trying to keep
this little tête-à-tête

11:44.870 --> 11:46.872
as short as possible,
what exactly can I do

11:46.939 --> 11:48.174
to get you sorted out?

11:48.240 --> 11:50.009
Whoever is pulling
the trigger...

11:50.076 --> 11:52.211
(gunshot)

11:52.278 --> 11:54.013
...they were trained by you.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.382
Well, that explains
why they're so accurate.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.385
Ah. You know, I've trained
snipers for 30 years

11:59.452 --> 12:02.188
in every branch of the military.

12:02.254 --> 12:05.758
Turned out hundreds
of elite combat sharpshooters

12:05.825 --> 12:07.860
and some not so much.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.228
In order to hit those shots,

12:09.295 --> 12:10.329
they'd have to be
at the top of their game.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.465
Mm-hmm.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.465
That means logging hours.

12:12.531 --> 12:15.234
And you have the only
long-distance range in New York.

12:15.301 --> 12:18.104
No one is thinking
that you're involved,

12:18.170 --> 12:21.173
I just need you to email me
a list of every ex-student

12:21.240 --> 12:24.176
who's been through here
in the past year.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.879
That almost sounds
like an order, Airman.

12:29.014 --> 12:31.016
You know what?

12:29.014 --> 12:31.016
What?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.219
Your chevrons are hanging in
a moth-filled closet somewhere,

12:33.285 --> 12:37.456
and I left this little
power dynamic years ago.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.291
So you can either
give me what I need

12:39.358 --> 12:41.393
or I can get a bunch of cops
to start digging around here.

12:41.460 --> 12:44.263
Off the top of your head,
how many illegal firearms

12:44.330 --> 12:46.332
do you think they'd find?

12:50.369 --> 12:53.139
I need that list
in 30 minutes.

12:53.205 --> 12:54.840
You could have been
something else, Bayani.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.376
You had the skills, just...

12:57.443 --> 12:58.477
just not the guts.

13:03.149 --> 13:03.949
(gunshot)

13:04.016 --> 13:05.184
How'd it go?

13:05.251 --> 13:07.520
As delightful
as expected.

13:07.586 --> 13:09.822
But Erickson just
emailed me the list.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.157
How about you two?
Any luck?

13:11.223 --> 13:12.791
Oh, yeah. Harry?

13:12.858 --> 13:14.927
So, we, uh,
went with your hypothesis

13:14.994 --> 13:17.530
about the two potential
perch locations.

13:17.596 --> 13:21.033
And it took a while, but
we found one common denominator.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.234
All three buildings
were serviced by the same

13:22.301 --> 13:23.536
commercial janitorial company,

13:23.602 --> 13:25.471
Clear Green Cleaning.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.540
Well, that explains
the sniper's access.

13:27.606 --> 13:29.808
That's what we thought,
so I hacked the mainframe,

13:29.875 --> 13:32.278
and, uh, managed to get this
list of all their employees.

13:32.344 --> 13:35.414
Just forwarded you
Erickson's list of ex-students.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.349
It's cross-referencing.

13:40.019 --> 13:41.187
Got a hit.

13:41.253 --> 13:43.189
ROBYN:
Silas Furlong.

13:43.255 --> 13:44.456
Oh, wow.

13:44.523 --> 13:46.392
Former Air Force sniper.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.460
You know him?

13:48.527 --> 13:51.497
No. How many tours?

13:51.564 --> 13:54.166
Five. Two in Iraq,
three in Afghanistan.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.968
Man, all in 15 years.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.403
He just left three years ago.

13:57.469 --> 13:59.071
How was he discharged?

13:59.138 --> 14:00.339
Honorable, but ODPMC.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.074
Mental issues?

14:00.406 --> 14:02.074
HARRY: Yeah.

14:02.141 --> 14:03.042
Looks like they
showed him the door

14:03.108 --> 14:04.176
after a few questionable kills.

14:04.243 --> 14:05.377
Yeah, I know a lot of vets

14:05.444 --> 14:06.378
who cycled out like that.

14:06.445 --> 14:07.947
Had a hard time
adjusting.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.181
How's it been
since he's been home?

14:09.248 --> 14:10.883
Not great.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.586
That's a long fall,
from sniper to a janitor.

14:13.652 --> 14:15.955
Looks like things fell apart
quickly after the discharge.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.389
His wife divorced him
within the year

14:17.456 --> 14:20.159
and then she filed a restraining
order filed against him,

14:20.226 --> 14:22.962
which he violated and for which
he was arrested twice.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.464
She got full custody of the kid
with no visitation.

14:25.531 --> 14:29.068
So he comes home,
loses it.

14:29.134 --> 14:33.138
Can't do what he's good at,
so, doesn't fit in.

14:33.205 --> 14:36.108
Family life starts breaking down
and out comes his rage.

14:36.175 --> 14:38.911
And he starts expressing it
the only way he knows how.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.212
Right, but what's-what's
with the ransom?

14:40.279 --> 14:42.481
I mean, he's trying
to punish the city?

14:42.548 --> 14:44.617
He's lashing out
at the people in charge?

14:44.683 --> 14:46.118
I don't know.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.587
But divorce...

14:50.389 --> 14:52.191
Means a sad
dad apartment.

14:58.697 --> 15:01.533
Yeah, he rented this one
six months ago.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.102
Let's go.

15:04.336 --> 15:05.537
(indistinct chatter)

15:06.105 --> 15:08.073
What about him?

15:08.140 --> 15:09.541
No, I heard all he's about
is Call of Duty.

15:09.608 --> 15:10.609
I could deal with that.

15:10.676 --> 15:11.110
(groans)

15:10.676 --> 15:11.110
(echoing laughter)

15:14.513 --> 15:16.282
You're a little cray today.

15:16.348 --> 15:17.583
Your Mom's never gonna know
we went out.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.286
No, it's not that.

15:20.352 --> 15:21.520
I mean, don't you feel
a little weird being out here

15:21.587 --> 15:23.255
with a sniper running around?

15:23.322 --> 15:24.957
Please. My mom says
you have a better chance

15:25.024 --> 15:26.392
of being hit by lightning.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.193
Yeah, you don't know that.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.228
(loud thud)

15:28.260 --> 15:29.228
(gasps)

15:29.295 --> 15:31.196
(panting)

15:31.263 --> 15:32.665
Oh, my God.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.402
Hey. You all right?

15:36.468 --> 15:38.037
Uh, yeah.

15:42.074 --> 15:44.143
(dog barking)

15:42.074 --> 15:44.143
(gunfire)

15:44.209 --> 15:45.611
(people screaming)

15:47.313 --> 15:48.547
DELILAH:
Jason!

15:48.614 --> 15:50.282
No!

15:50.349 --> 15:52.318
TIFFANY (muffled):
Dee, are you okay?

15:52.384 --> 15:54.019
(Delilah crying)

15:56.522 --> 15:58.023
DELILAH:
Oh, God. Oh, God...

16:22.214 --> 16:23.515
Clear.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.988
This look like a single guy's
place to you?

16:31.223 --> 16:33.225
Looks like someone
recreating what they lost.

16:33.292 --> 16:34.293
Yeah.

16:40.766 --> 16:44.603
I see his personal effects,
but where's his gear?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.372
Where's
everything else?

16:46.438 --> 16:48.540
Maybe he has a storage shed.

16:53.379 --> 16:54.346
(soft rattle)

17:02.788 --> 17:04.556
Got it.

17:09.261 --> 17:10.062
(exhales)

17:14.633 --> 17:17.035
"Shooter terrorizes city."

17:17.102 --> 17:18.704
Looks like
we're at the right place.

17:22.341 --> 17:24.543
It's his D.O.P.E. book.

17:24.610 --> 17:26.712
All the data on his
previous engagements.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.580
He logged
a bunch of hours.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.582
Meticulous, too.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.421
It's him.

17:35.487 --> 17:37.523
Logs on the last three
shootings.

17:37.589 --> 17:40.592
And he's researching
a place on the East Side.

17:40.659 --> 17:42.060
I know that intersection.

17:42.127 --> 17:43.829
That's the falafel place
everybody goes to.

17:50.335 --> 17:52.604
(line ringing)

17:52.671 --> 17:56.108
Dante, we found him, and
we found his next target area.

17:56.175 --> 17:57.342
I'm gonna send you the address.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.311
You need to get some units
down there now.

17:59.378 --> 18:02.481
Rob, these calculations.

18:02.548 --> 18:05.117
Given the wind conditions
and the position of the sun,

18:05.184 --> 18:07.352
if he's looking
for the perfect time to shoot,

18:07.419 --> 18:09.254
it's in the next 15 minutes.

18:16.395 --> 18:17.429
Clear the area!

18:17.496 --> 18:18.363
Clear!

18:18.430 --> 18:19.832
Take cover!

18:19.898 --> 18:21.333
MEL: Clear!

18:19.898 --> 18:21.333
Get down! Get down!

18:21.400 --> 18:22.468
(gunshot)

18:21.400 --> 18:22.468
(grunts)

18:22.534 --> 18:23.535
(people screaming)

18:25.370 --> 18:27.539
ROBYN:
Get to cover! Get to cover now!

18:28.207 --> 18:29.341
Grab her legs.

18:37.683 --> 18:38.650
It's okay.

18:43.188 --> 18:44.356
I know where he is.

18:44.423 --> 18:46.158
Go!

18:54.900 --> 18:57.536
Hold on.
Just breathe. Breathe.

18:57.603 --> 19:00.572
Breathe. Hang on.
Hang on, hold on.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.174
(siren wailing in distance)

19:00.639 --> 19:02.174
(indistinct chatter)

19:13.785 --> 19:14.653
Excu... Move.

19:15.754 --> 19:17.923
(grunts)

19:17.990 --> 19:18.857
Move, move, move!

19:18.924 --> 19:20.259
Move, move, move, move!

19:24.563 --> 19:25.831
(buzzes)

19:28.000 --> 19:28.767
(grunting)

19:34.973 --> 19:36.575
If it wasn't for you,
she'd be dead.

19:36.642 --> 19:37.876
Yeah, well,
we didn't get Furlong.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.511
Still a win.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.480
We know who he is
now. We'll find him.

19:43.615 --> 19:45.951
Well, given his mindset,

19:46.018 --> 19:48.387
I would get the wife and kid
into protective custody.

19:48.453 --> 19:49.788
Already have units on the way.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.323
Madam D.A.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.624
I hear you found the shooter.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.293
The mayor's very relieved.

19:54.359 --> 19:57.396
Well, don't breathe yet.
Job's not done.

19:57.462 --> 19:59.398
Furlong knows you're coming,

19:59.464 --> 20:01.800
which means any guardrails
he had left are gone.

20:01.867 --> 20:02.868
You don't think he'll run?

20:02.935 --> 20:05.604
I mean, if I were him, I'd...

20:05.671 --> 20:08.507
You'd what?

20:08.574 --> 20:09.875
I'm sorry.
Excuse me for a second.

20:11.443 --> 20:12.744
Dee, you good?

20:12.811 --> 20:15.213
Ms. McCall, it's Tiffany.

20:12.811 --> 20:15.213
What's wrong?

20:15.280 --> 20:17.916
There's something
the matter with Dee.

20:17.983 --> 20:19.685
We're at the park
across from my house.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.553
You need to come now.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.221
I got to go.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.758
What do you think
that's all about?

20:24.623 --> 20:26.758
I'm not sure.

20:26.825 --> 20:29.528
Well, find out. I want to know
what she thinks he'll do.

20:29.595 --> 20:32.331
In the meantime,
release his photo to the press.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.865
I want everyone in the city
looking for him.

20:54.853 --> 20:56.254
Is she all right?

20:57.623 --> 20:59.658
(whispers):
No.

20:59.725 --> 21:00.993
But she's calm for now.

21:01.059 --> 21:03.729
I've never seen her like that.

21:03.795 --> 21:06.698
The shaking,
the look in her eyes.

21:06.765 --> 21:07.966
What happened?

21:08.033 --> 21:11.036
A post-traumatic
stress reaction.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.537
A bad one.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.573
Jason.

21:14.640 --> 21:15.907
The shooting.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.611
This whole sniper thing
must have triggered her.

21:20.912 --> 21:23.281
Or maybe I missed the signs.

21:23.348 --> 21:25.050
I should've known this
would be possible,

21:25.117 --> 21:26.785
I should've gotten ahead of it.

21:27.986 --> 21:30.322
Honey, stop beating yourself up.
We see it now.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.526
How do we help her?

21:34.593 --> 21:35.927
What do we do?

21:38.997 --> 21:40.966
She's gonna need
professional help.

21:43.602 --> 21:44.603
Or this could get worse.

21:45.937 --> 21:47.739
Okay.

21:49.641 --> 21:50.976
Then we get her the help
she needs, Mama.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.648
Thanks. Yeah, we will.

21:58.617 --> 21:59.751
How's Dee?

21:59.818 --> 22:02.087
She sounds pretty shaken.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.555
So is Robyn.

22:03.622 --> 22:04.956
I told her we'd check in
on them,

22:05.023 --> 22:07.426
but the best thing
we can do for her

22:07.492 --> 22:08.894
right now is find this guy.

22:08.960 --> 22:09.428
Any news?

22:09.494 --> 22:12.564
NYPD's got nothing.

22:12.631 --> 22:14.833
What about you?

22:14.900 --> 22:18.036
I mean, what would you do next?

22:18.103 --> 22:19.705
Anybody can get inside
this guy's head, it's you.

22:21.807 --> 22:24.743
(scoffs)
I don't want to.

22:24.810 --> 22:26.878
I've known snipers like him.

22:29.448 --> 22:30.949
In the field,

22:31.016 --> 22:33.452
they try to take away
all ambiguity.

22:33.518 --> 22:37.355
The tell you, "Shoot them
or they'll shoot you."

22:37.422 --> 22:39.758
You're told they're targets,
not people.

22:41.593 --> 22:44.930
You do that long enough,
you either compartmentalize

22:44.996 --> 22:47.432
and hang on
to your humanity, or...

22:51.169 --> 22:55.107
...switch off a part of
your brain and lose your soul.

22:55.173 --> 22:57.476
Furlong is the latter.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.611
I could see it in his eyes.

22:59.678 --> 23:02.581
What? H-He saw you?

23:02.647 --> 23:04.082
Just for a second.

23:04.149 --> 23:05.951
(scoffs quietly)

23:06.017 --> 23:08.053
You know what? It was weird,
'cause we have never met,

23:08.120 --> 23:10.122
but there was recognition
on his face.

23:10.188 --> 23:11.723
Well, I mean,
do you think he knows you?

23:11.790 --> 23:13.492
We both trained
under the same guy.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.394
Oh, boy.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.394
And I was a rarity
behind the scope.

23:16.461 --> 23:17.796
Women still are.

23:17.863 --> 23:19.998
It gave us a certain notoriety.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.433
Okay. Someone else
is closing down the bar tonight.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.834
Harry.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.834
What?

23:22.901 --> 23:23.969
The-the guy is a killer.

23:24.035 --> 23:25.403
I mean, do you think
I'm overreacting?

23:25.470 --> 23:27.906
No.

23:27.973 --> 23:29.007
No, it's okay.

23:30.642 --> 23:33.445
I love that you
worry about me.

23:33.512 --> 23:34.679
Okay?

23:34.746 --> 23:36.648
Don't ever stop.

23:36.715 --> 23:38.183
I won't.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.863
WOMAN:
You've reached
the NYPD tip line.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.498
If you're calling about
an incident in progress,

23:53.565 --> 23:55.767
please dial 911.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.767
(beep)

23:55.834 --> 23:58.003
It seems like
you now know who I am.

23:58.069 --> 24:00.639
So now the game
is gonna change.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.177
If I don't get my money in
12 hours, I'm gonna escalate...

24:05.243 --> 24:07.045
♪ ♪

24:13.885 --> 24:16.521
Dee's up.

24:16.588 --> 24:18.990
We talked a bit.

24:19.057 --> 24:20.792
Seems like she's doing
a little better.

24:20.859 --> 24:23.128
Well, she's shifted
from the impact stage,

24:23.195 --> 24:26.164
which is where
anxiety dissipates.

24:26.231 --> 24:28.667
But it also means

24:28.733 --> 24:30.836
she's likely to slip back
into denial.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.639
And I'm not gonna let
that happen on my watch.

24:34.706 --> 24:37.475
(phone vibrates)

24:37.542 --> 24:38.844
Got to take this.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.813
Hey.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.015
You took off
pretty fast yesterday.

24:44.082 --> 24:45.951
Everything okay with your kid?

24:48.253 --> 24:49.988
Seen enough mothers
get calls like that

24:50.055 --> 24:51.056
to know what one looks like.

24:52.991 --> 24:55.594
It's gonna be fine.
Thanks.

24:57.562 --> 24:59.865
Speaking of family,
we've got Furlong's.

24:59.931 --> 25:01.700
They're a little shaken,
but seem okay.

25:01.766 --> 25:03.068
What'd they say?

25:03.134 --> 25:04.703
Wife's shocked
but not surprised.

25:04.769 --> 25:06.538
She noticed a shift
in his personality

25:06.605 --> 25:08.640
after his last deployment.

25:08.707 --> 25:11.142
Well, did she give you anything
regarding his whereabouts?

25:11.209 --> 25:12.143
Nothing of use.

25:12.210 --> 25:14.179
She hasn't been in contact
with him recently.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.781
The reason I called...

25:16.848 --> 25:19.684
there's been a new threat.

25:19.751 --> 25:22.020
(beeps)

25:19.751 --> 25:22.020
Listen.

25:22.087 --> 25:24.022
FURLONG:
It seems like
you now know who I am.

25:24.089 --> 25:26.558
So now the game
is gonna change.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.526
If I don't get my money
in the next 12 hours,

25:28.593 --> 25:30.095
I'm gonna escalate
the punishment.

25:30.161 --> 25:31.830
If I can't have my kids,

25:31.897 --> 25:33.999
then New York sure as hell
can't have theirs.

25:34.065 --> 25:36.034
He's going after kids?

25:36.101 --> 25:39.170
Furlong sent an email with
instructions on the ransom drop,

25:39.237 --> 25:41.306
the pressure on the mayor is
too much, he's decided to pay.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.208
No, this is wrong.

25:44.743 --> 25:47.545
We know who he is,
we have his family.

25:47.612 --> 25:48.713
He'll never be able
to disappear,

25:48.780 --> 25:50.081
so the money is useless.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.218
Drop's got to be a diversion.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.653
From what?

25:54.719 --> 25:56.121
He's in endgame now.

25:56.187 --> 25:57.923
He knows he's cornered.

25:57.989 --> 26:00.558
He's gonna go out with a bang.

26:07.165 --> 26:09.734
If he's not going to the drop,
where is he going?

26:09.801 --> 26:11.269
Well, if the drop
is way out in Brooklyn,

26:11.336 --> 26:12.570
then it stands to reason that...

26:12.637 --> 26:13.805
That whatever he's planning

26:13.872 --> 26:16.808
will be as far away as possible.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.877
All right, pulling up
every office building

26:18.944 --> 26:20.011
serviced by
Clear Green Cleaning.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.748
There must be three dozen, Rob.

26:23.815 --> 26:26.117
Filter by places with locations
near groups of children.

26:26.184 --> 26:27.319
Parks.

26:27.385 --> 26:28.787
Schools. That sort of thing.

26:28.853 --> 26:29.854
You really think
he'd kill a child?

26:29.921 --> 26:33.224
I think he's pathological,
potentially suicidal,

26:33.291 --> 26:35.927
and he blames the city
for taking away his own kids.

26:35.994 --> 26:38.263
So, yes.
There's still too many.

26:38.330 --> 26:41.032
Yeah, it's 18 buildings spread
out over all five boroughs.

26:41.099 --> 26:41.833
There's no way to cover

26:41.900 --> 26:42.867
that large of an area.

26:46.071 --> 26:48.340
HARRY:
Rob?

26:48.406 --> 26:50.008
Maybe Furlong's wife can help.

26:51.409 --> 26:54.245
Do any of these seem familiar?

26:54.312 --> 26:55.947
Any that might hold
significance for your ex?

26:56.014 --> 26:58.883
I told you, I don't know him.
Not anymore.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.318
The man I loved--

27:00.385 --> 27:01.853
the man I met in sixth grade--
is gone.

27:03.855 --> 27:05.991
The man who came home,
I don't even recognize.

27:07.726 --> 27:09.894
I want to help you,
Detective, but

27:09.961 --> 27:11.096
I don't know
any of these buildings.

27:12.330 --> 27:13.865
Hi.

27:12.330 --> 27:13.865
It's okay.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.767
We're done.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.635
Is Daddy taking me
to the playground?

27:17.702 --> 27:19.637
Which playground, sweetie?

27:19.704 --> 27:21.139
That's Daddy's building.

27:21.206 --> 27:23.008
When we works there,
he takes me to the park

27:23.074 --> 27:24.376
up the street.

27:24.442 --> 27:25.110
And then we get ice cream.

27:30.415 --> 27:32.117
This park?

27:34.019 --> 27:35.020
You sure?

27:35.086 --> 27:36.721
Uh-huh.

27:36.788 --> 27:38.156

Hey.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.748
What you thinking?

28:05.750 --> 28:08.219
How I humiliated myself

28:08.286 --> 28:09.888
in front of all my friends.

28:12.223 --> 28:14.092
Everyone's gonna

28:45.323 --> 28:46.925
You'll get it.

28:53.798 --> 28:55.333
What's up?

28:55.400 --> 28:57.769
Think I've got the sniper's
next location.

28:57.836 --> 28:59.838
There's a park outside
near one of the office buildings

28:59.904 --> 29:01.739
where Furlong used
to take his daughter.

29:01.806 --> 29:03.408
Fits his line of thinking:

29:03.475 --> 29:05.777
if he can't go there
with his kid, then nobody can.

29:05.844 --> 29:08.246
You need to get a show of force
over there A.S.A.P.

29:08.313 --> 29:10.115
I already called the D.A.

29:10.181 --> 29:11.983
They've got all available
resources at the ransom drop

29:12.050 --> 29:13.818
and the mayor
won't divert them on a hunch.

29:13.885 --> 29:15.820
You can't be serious.

29:15.887 --> 29:17.822
Until we have something
concrete, we're on our own.

29:17.889 --> 29:19.757
I'll text you the address
and meet you there.

29:19.824 --> 29:21.126
(sighs)

29:30.368 --> 29:31.169
(siren wailing)

29:35.106 --> 29:36.441
You two, clear the park.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.877
You two, come with me.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.912
Building's three blocks down.

29:43.248 --> 29:44.883
Let's go.

29:43.248 --> 29:44.883
Get everyone

29:44.949 --> 29:46.384
out of the park now, let's go.

29:44.949 --> 29:46.384
Detective Dante.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.187
For your safety,
we got to clear the park.

29:49.254 --> 29:50.221
Move it.

29:51.489 --> 29:52.457
Sorry, have we met?

29:52.524 --> 29:53.558
We have a mutual friend.

29:54.893 --> 29:56.127
So, where is she?

29:56.194 --> 29:57.495
She's taking care of something.

29:57.562 --> 29:59.330
It's just us.

29:59.397 --> 30:01.065
Understood.

30:03.568 --> 30:05.370
The serial killer.

30:05.436 --> 30:07.505
It was you
at my house that night.

30:07.572 --> 30:09.340
You fired the shot
that took him out.

30:09.407 --> 30:11.009
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

30:11.075 --> 30:12.977
(phone vibrates)

30:11.075 --> 30:12.977
Of course not.

30:13.044 --> 30:14.145
Hey.

30:14.212 --> 30:15.914
Hey, it's the right building.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.982
Furlong crossed the lobby
20 minutes ago.

30:18.049 --> 30:19.350
I'm texting you a pic right now.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.419
Facial rec has him
at a 78% match.

30:23.154 --> 30:25.390
Uh, yeah.
That's one of the janitors.

30:25.456 --> 30:26.558
I keyed him up
to the tenth floor.

30:32.964 --> 30:34.132
(whispering):
This side faces the park.

30:43.641 --> 30:46.010
Hold up. He's in this one.

30:46.077 --> 30:47.245
You sure?

30:47.312 --> 30:48.846
DANTE:
It's booby-trapped.

30:48.913 --> 30:50.915
Sloppy but effective.

30:48.913 --> 30:50.915
How do we get in?

30:50.982 --> 30:52.016
We don't.
I get the bomb squad down here.

30:52.083 --> 30:53.284
How long will that take?

30:53.351 --> 30:54.385
20 minutes.

30:54.452 --> 30:55.553
The Las Vegas sniper

30:55.620 --> 30:56.421
killed 60 people
in less than ten.

30:56.487 --> 30:58.189
We can't wait.

30:58.256 --> 30:59.023
Where are you going?

31:06.464 --> 31:08.266
♪ ♪

31:18.309 --> 31:19.577
Hey. What's going on?

31:19.644 --> 31:21.446
Nothing, baby.

31:21.512 --> 31:23.047
Let me hear some more
of your music.

31:23.114 --> 31:24.249
No. Was that about the sniper?

31:26.284 --> 31:27.218
I heard you
on the phone earlier.

31:27.285 --> 31:28.920
Are you working that case?

31:28.987 --> 31:31.089
If something's happening,
you should go.

31:31.155 --> 31:32.624
Look, there's always
something happening.

31:32.690 --> 31:36.094
I just want to be here with you.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.363
Mom, you do not need
to babysit me.

31:38.429 --> 31:40.098
I am fine.

31:40.164 --> 31:41.633
I'm over it.

31:41.699 --> 31:44.402
Yeah, that's what you're saying,
but you're not.

31:44.469 --> 31:48.039
Post-traumatic stress is real,
and it's serious.

31:50.308 --> 31:51.242
I know.

31:51.309 --> 31:54.245
But just listen.

31:54.312 --> 31:56.347
I understand
that I've got an issue,

31:56.414 --> 31:59.150
and I appreciate you
being here for me.

31:59.217 --> 32:01.052
But I also know that we're not
gonna fix my problems

32:01.119 --> 32:02.053
in the next few hours,

32:02.120 --> 32:04.022
and there's a whole city
that needs your help.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.591
Right now.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.593
Okay? So go help them,

32:08.660 --> 32:11.362
and come back to me.

32:11.429 --> 32:12.964
Alive.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.305
No, I need everybody here
right now.

32:20.371 --> 32:21.939
Clear all the pedestrians
from this street.

32:22.006 --> 32:22.974
And get all those kids
to safety.

32:26.210 --> 32:28.713
The woman who was with me--
where'd she go?

32:39.624 --> 32:41.025
Where are you hiding?

32:45.163 --> 32:47.598
Figured you'd show up.

32:47.665 --> 32:48.666
Put it down.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.435
Put it down!

32:57.108 --> 32:58.476
You can't shoot
the park from here.

33:00.111 --> 33:01.145
No?

33:02.647 --> 33:04.515
This isn't about kids, is it?

33:04.582 --> 33:06.584
It's about killing cops.

33:06.651 --> 33:09.587
Do you know what it's like
to be arrested?

33:09.654 --> 33:10.755
To be torn away from your kid?

33:10.822 --> 33:12.623
It was all a ruse.

33:12.690 --> 33:15.026
The message, the drop.

33:15.093 --> 33:17.095
You wanted us to find
that building,

33:17.161 --> 33:19.030
to think you were in that room.

33:19.097 --> 33:21.699
Get them all rushing there into
a situation that you control.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.337
They'll stage down there.

33:26.404 --> 33:27.739
Away from where they think I am.

33:27.805 --> 33:29.240
(siren wailing in distance)

33:29.307 --> 33:30.141
It's a perfect
angle from here.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.278
You're drawing them
into a kill box.

33:34.345 --> 33:36.781
They treated me like a criminal.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.116
After everything
I gave my country.

33:38.182 --> 33:39.250
This is payback.

33:39.317 --> 33:40.651
You know, Silas,

33:40.718 --> 33:44.122
you don't have to do this.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.657
Killing innocent people
is not payback.

33:46.724 --> 33:49.727
Nobody is innocent.

33:49.794 --> 33:51.362
You never learned that.

33:52.563 --> 33:54.465
Yeah.
Yeah, I know

33:54.532 --> 33:56.167
all about you, Melody Bayani.

33:57.602 --> 33:59.370
Going through
sniper school,

33:59.437 --> 34:01.339
Erickson used you
as a cautionary tale.

34:01.406 --> 34:03.207
Told us how
you froze.

34:03.274 --> 34:05.643
You were given an order

34:05.710 --> 34:07.712
to take out the enemy,
but you didn't have the guts.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.783
It's almost embarrassing
they sent you after me.

34:11.849 --> 34:14.585
Yeah, Erickson loves that story.

34:14.652 --> 34:17.722
How the woman froze.

34:17.789 --> 34:20.158
You want to know the truth?

34:20.224 --> 34:23.227
I didn't take that shot
on purpose.

34:23.294 --> 34:24.195
It was a bad call.

34:24.262 --> 34:26.063
The target was just a kid.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.632
The daughter of a local
who had wandered

34:27.698 --> 34:29.500
too close to our position.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.602
But Erickson panicked.

34:31.669 --> 34:33.738
So I said that I froze.

34:33.805 --> 34:36.407
I don't shoot innocents.

34:36.474 --> 34:38.476
But Erickson--

34:38.543 --> 34:41.512
you know his ego--
he couldn't stand it.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.848
So he smeared my name.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.550
He left me to rot
at some Podunk base.

34:45.616 --> 34:46.784
And you know what,
I might have.

34:46.851 --> 34:50.221
Only, the Taliban
got bad intel

34:50.288 --> 34:52.256
that we had
a weapons cache.

34:52.323 --> 34:55.760
They stormed the base,
and let me tell you something,

34:55.827 --> 34:58.262
I took plenty of hard shots
that day.

34:59.664 --> 35:01.732
Classified shots.

35:01.799 --> 35:04.569
I had 17 confirmed kills.

35:04.635 --> 35:07.104
17 confirmed snipes?

35:04.635 --> 35:07.104
No.

35:07.171 --> 35:09.640
14 snipes.

35:09.707 --> 35:11.209
The last three--

35:11.275 --> 35:13.444
well... they were all

35:13.511 --> 35:14.545
close-quarter!

35:14.612 --> 35:15.713
(both grunting)

35:23.521 --> 35:24.589
(grunts)

35:25.523 --> 35:26.424
(groans)

35:46.344 --> 35:47.411
(groans)

35:53.751 --> 35:54.785
I don't freeze, either.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.490
(coughing)

36:01.859 --> 36:03.361
(moans)

36:05.530 --> 36:07.632
Thank you.

36:07.698 --> 36:08.933
(grunts)

36:09.000 --> 36:11.402
Ooh, but I totally had that.

36:11.469 --> 36:12.803
No doubt.
(chuckles)

36:12.870 --> 36:15.306
(laughs, panting)

36:15.373 --> 36:17.174
Wait a minute,
how'd you know I was here?

36:40.331 --> 36:41.399
Thank your friend
for me, will you?

36:43.434 --> 36:44.835
Don't mention it.

36:44.902 --> 36:46.637
Or her.

36:46.704 --> 36:47.872
To anyone.

36:51.576 --> 36:52.677
DANTE:
Explosive's been disabled.

36:52.743 --> 36:53.878
Scene is secure.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.546
Thank you, Detective.

36:55.613 --> 36:57.615
And thank you.
The city's grateful.

36:57.682 --> 36:58.916
If there's ever
anything you need...

36:58.983 --> 37:00.885
Oh, I'll be sure
to let you know.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.624
Actually, what would you think

37:06.691 --> 37:08.259
about coming into the fold?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.395
Working with us,

37:11.462 --> 37:12.730
in an unofficial capacity.

37:14.732 --> 37:17.234
Thanks.

37:17.301 --> 37:18.736
But that's not me.

37:22.039 --> 37:23.874
But if you're ever in trouble,

37:23.941 --> 37:25.743
you know how to find me.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.696
(muffled):
Oh, sweet mother of God!

37:45.763 --> 37:46.731
That's spicy!

37:46.797 --> 37:48.466
(chuckles)

37:53.437 --> 37:55.773
(coughs)

37:55.840 --> 37:57.041
That was torture.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.577
Oh, come on,
it's not that spicy.

37:59.644 --> 38:02.446
No.
Seeing you on that roof.

38:02.513 --> 38:04.415
Knowing I couldn't be there
to have your back

38:04.482 --> 38:06.651
was torture.

38:08.419 --> 38:09.854
I know.
You don't need my help.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.323
No, I... I get it.

38:14.025 --> 38:16.661
I would feel the same if
the situation was reversed.

38:18.929 --> 38:23.334
In a way, I know
I've had it easy.

38:23.401 --> 38:26.737
You know, I know you're
always here, always safe.

38:26.804 --> 38:28.906
And I want you to go out
into the world.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.608
I do.

38:30.675 --> 38:32.076
But if I'm honest...

38:33.978 --> 38:35.746
...it'll be an adjustment.

38:35.813 --> 38:39.083
Hmm.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.919
Oh, hey, I meant
to ask you something.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.088
Why didn't you tell that bastard
Erickson what really happened?

38:44.155 --> 38:46.057
I mean, this guy

38:46.123 --> 38:50.027
has no idea, uh, like,
insanely

38:50.094 --> 38:51.929
impressive career
you went on to have.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.664
How could you not
just want rub that in?

38:53.731 --> 38:56.667
Because I take perverse pleasure

38:56.734 --> 38:58.502
in knowing that
he was wrong about me.

38:58.569 --> 38:59.970
(scoffs)

39:00.037 --> 39:01.706
Besides, if I was
never on that base,

39:01.772 --> 39:04.341
I would've never have pulled
into military intelligence

39:04.408 --> 39:05.943
and I might not have met

39:06.010 --> 39:07.445
this handsome face.

39:08.946 --> 39:10.748
Mm.
I'm really glad

39:10.815 --> 39:12.950
You didn't shoot that woman.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.585
For both of us.

39:17.855 --> 39:18.856
Cheers.

39:17.855 --> 39:18.856
Mm-hmm.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.369
Still shaking?

39:32.436 --> 39:33.804
It only happens occasionally.

39:36.707 --> 39:39.910
Like you said, Mom,
I'm gonna be fine.

39:39.977 --> 39:40.978
Because I have you.

39:45.149 --> 39:46.150
Listen, baby.

39:48.552 --> 39:49.987
I'm always gonna
be here for you.

39:51.489 --> 39:53.057
But you need more than me.

39:54.725 --> 39:57.628
You need professional help.

39:57.695 --> 40:00.030
Come on, Mom, a shrink?

40:00.097 --> 40:01.932
Post-traumatic stress
is no joke.

40:01.999 --> 40:04.168
Let me tell you
something,

40:04.235 --> 40:07.938
everyone needs help
from time to time.

40:08.005 --> 40:09.039
Even me.

40:11.909 --> 40:12.810
You had this, too?

40:19.650 --> 40:20.785
And with the kind of secrets
we're carrying,

40:20.851 --> 40:23.988
we can't just talk to anyone.

40:24.054 --> 40:27.725
They need to be someone
in my community.

40:27.792 --> 40:30.694
Someone you'd be safe
telling everything to.

40:30.761 --> 40:33.464
But in the meantime,

40:33.531 --> 40:36.200
I've asked a friend over.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.736
He's someone who...

40:38.803 --> 40:41.038
who's helped me through
some rough patches of my own.

40:41.105 --> 40:43.073
You mean a friend from the C...

40:45.075 --> 40:47.044
He's family.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.747
(knock on door)

40:49.814 --> 40:51.916
As a matter of fact,
he met you

40:51.982 --> 40:54.585
just after you were born.

40:54.652 --> 40:55.686
(door opens)

41:02.793 --> 41:03.794
Hey, Delilah.
