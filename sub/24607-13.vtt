WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:02.524
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.567 --> 00:04.004
THE VALLEY IS OURS.

00:04.047 --> 00:06.310
AS LONG AS YOU STAY HERE,
WE WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:06.354 --> 00:08.095
THIS WAR IS
ABOUT TO BE FOUGHT

00:08.138 --> 00:10.140
ON THE LAST SURVIVABLE
LAND ON EARTH.

00:12.099 --> 00:15.232
RETREAT! GO BACK
TO THE WASTELAND!

00:15.276 --> 00:16.581
DID YOU SEE BELLAMY?

00:16.625 --> 00:18.453
HE'S WITH OCTAVIA.
WE GOTTA GO BACK
AND GET THEM.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.237
NO ONE ELSE IS DYING
TO SAVE BLODREINA.

00:20.281 --> 00:23.458
INDRA: THE CHILD WITH CLARKE
IS A REAL NATBLIDA.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.634
SHE ALONE
CAN UNIFY WONKRU.

00:25.677 --> 00:27.505
CLARKE, THERE'S NO TIME.
WE HAVE TO GO.

00:27.549 --> 00:28.811
YOU HAVE TO GO.
I HAVE TO STOP

00:28.854 --> 00:30.682
THAT TRANSPORT SHIP
FROM TAKING OFF.

00:30.726 --> 00:33.729
OCTAVIA: WHEN THEY OPEN FIRE,
RUN LIKE HELL.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.774
MURPHY: SOMEBODY
CALL FOR A RESCUE?

00:35.818 --> 00:37.994
OCTAVIA, GET IN NOW!

00:38.038 --> 00:38.951
MAN: UHH!

01:21.168 --> 01:23.953
WE CAN'T STAY HERE.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.302
WE NEED
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.391
THERE'S NO FOOD.
THERE'S NO WATER.

01:27.435 --> 01:29.393
AND THE RAIN
ISN'T DRINKABLE
FROM THE ASH.

01:29.437 --> 01:30.699
IT'S TIME
TO SURRENDER.

01:30.742 --> 01:32.048
THE PEOPLE WHO
TRIED TO SURRENDER

01:32.092 --> 01:33.789
WERE SLAUGHTERED
IN THE GORGE.

01:33.832 --> 01:35.791
THE ENEMY, THEY DON'T
WANT PRISONERS.

01:35.834 --> 01:36.705
THEY WANT US DEAD.

01:36.748 --> 01:37.967
THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE GONNA GET

01:38.010 --> 01:39.055
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.317
HARPER:
WE HAVE TO FIGHT.

01:40.361 --> 01:42.145
THE LONGER WE WAIT,
THE HARDER
IT'S GONNA BE.

01:42.189 --> 01:44.278
NOBODY'S GONNA FOLLOW ME
BACK INTO THAT GORGE.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.281
THEN WE'RE ALREADY DEAD.

01:51.415 --> 01:52.286
THEY MADE IT.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.765
MAN: WE DON'T KNOW
IT'S THEM.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.854
MILLER: GUNNERS,
SPREAD OUT AND TAKE AIM.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.075
FIRE ONLY ON MY COMMAND.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.690
MAN: LITTLE HELP, LITTLE HELP.
WE GOT WOUNDED.

02:07.301 --> 02:08.737
STAND DOWN!
STAND DOWN!

02:08.780 --> 02:09.738
THEY'RE WITH US.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.348
BELLAMY: MONTY,
WHERE'S JACKSON?

02:11.392 --> 02:12.567
SHE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

02:12.610 --> 02:15.222
I GOT HER!
I GOT HER!

02:15.265 --> 02:16.614
SHE'LL BE OK NOW.

02:16.658 --> 02:18.355
WILL SHE?
LOOK AROUND YOU.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.096
DO YOU SEE SIGNS
OF HOPE HERE?

02:47.950 --> 02:49.212
WHAT DO I DO?

02:49.256 --> 02:50.431
MAN: BLODREINA'S COMING.

02:50.474 --> 02:51.649
PROTECT YOUR COMMANDER!

02:56.393 --> 02:58.265
-OUT OF MY WAY.

03:02.312 --> 03:04.314
O, SHE SAVED US.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.186
LET HER PASS.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.404
HEDA, THAT IS
NOT A GOOD--

03:07.448 --> 03:08.797
I SAID, LET HER PASS.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.460
WE CAN'T WAIT MUCH LONGER.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.549
McCREARY HAS
RAVEN AND SHAW.

04:48.592 --> 04:50.638
ONE OF THEM WILL BREAK
AND FLY THAT SHIP.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.335
YOU SAID CLARKE
WAS HANDLING THAT.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.598
SHE IS.
BUT I'D RATHER NOT LET

04:54.642 --> 04:56.078
MISSILES TELL US
SHE'S FAILED.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.558
WHAT'S LEFT OF THE FIRST
BATTALION IS READY.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.124
THE COMMANDER'S ARMY
IS, TOO.

05:00.691 --> 05:03.259
WE'RE ALL THE COMMANDER'S
ARMY NOW.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.353
SO, WHERE'S
THE COMMANDER?

05:26.630 --> 05:28.545
WOMAN:
JACKSON, INDRA'S HERE.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.550
SHE'S LOST
A LOT OF BLOOD,

05:33.594 --> 05:35.160
BUT SHE'S STRONG.

05:35.204 --> 05:36.597
IF WE CAN GET HER
TO ABBY,

05:36.640 --> 05:38.555
SHE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO KEEP THE LEG.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.000
IT'S TIME, MADI.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.876
EVERYONE WILL
FOLLOW YOU,

05:54.919 --> 05:56.921
BUT YOU HAVE
TO LEAD THEM.

05:56.965 --> 05:59.489
I DON'T WANT TO LEAD THEM
INTO A MASSACRE.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.317
WE HAVE
THE NUMBERS, HEDA.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.232
AS LONG AS
WE PRESS FORWARD,

06:03.275 --> 06:04.407
WE'LL MAKE IT THROUGH.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.409
WE'LL BE
RIGHT BESIDE YOU.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.933
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT MYSELF.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.587
LOOK AROUND YOU.

06:10.631 --> 06:11.936
THERE HAS TO BE
A BETTER WAY THAN

06:11.980 --> 06:14.330
RUSHING BACK
IN TO THOSE GUNS.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.419
INDRA: IF THERE IS,
WE WOULD'VE THOUGHT OF IT.

06:16.463 --> 06:19.248
ASK THE COMMANDERS.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.688
HOW, SEDA?

06:24.732 --> 06:26.734
THEY ONLY TALK
TO ME IN MY DREAMS

06:26.777 --> 06:29.345
AND SHOW ME WHAT
THEY WANT ME TO SEE.

06:32.435 --> 06:33.480
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

06:33.523 --> 06:34.916
GAIA, WE DON'T
HAVE TIME--

06:34.959 --> 06:36.483
JUST WAIT.

06:44.665 --> 06:49.452
BREATHE.
IN AND OUT.

06:49.496 --> 06:52.237
LET THIS WORLD
PEEL AWAY.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.544
AND REPEAT AFTER ME.

06:54.588 --> 06:57.155
MENS MEA
FIAT MENS TUA.

06:57.199 --> 07:01.159
MENS MEA
FIAT MENS TUA.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.395
I HAVE A PLAN.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.747
OF COURSE YOU DO.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.235
WHICH ONE OF YOU
IS READY

07:33.278 --> 07:34.802
TO FLY THIS SHIP
FOR ME?

07:35.933 --> 07:37.631
SHAW: AAH!
RAVEN: STOP!

07:37.674 --> 07:39.154
STOP! LEAVE HIM ALONE.

07:43.201 --> 07:45.552
KUBA ON RADIO: BOSS,
WE GOT MOVEMENT ON THE SAND.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.031
LOOKS LIKE A VEHICLE.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.339
HOW FAR AWAY?

07:50.382 --> 07:51.688
KUBA: ABOUT 5 CLICKS.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.516
THE REST OF THEIR ARMY IS
JUST OUTSIDE THE GORGE,

07:53.560 --> 07:54.735
TUCKED AGAINST THE WALL.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.127
McCREARY: COPY THAT.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.608
IT'S TIME TO BRING THE MISSILES
TO THIS PARTY.

08:00.741 --> 08:03.570
WE CHARGE
ON MY COMMAND.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.746
McCREARY: GOOD NEWS.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.704
YOUR DENTIST APPOINTMENT
IS OVER.

08:07.748 --> 08:10.794
WE HAVE AN ARMY OF SAVAGES
TO DESTROY.

08:10.838 --> 08:15.364
SO, LET'S SEE WHAT
WE CAN TAKE OFF WITH THIS.

08:15.407 --> 08:18.498
I TOLD YOU--YOU DON'T NEED
YOUR LEGS TO FLY.

08:23.677 --> 08:27.376
RAVEN: STOP!
STOP! PLEASE!

08:27.419 --> 08:28.769
I'LL DO IT.

08:28.812 --> 08:31.293
I'LL FLY THE SHIP.

08:39.823 --> 08:42.609
IF WE'RE NOT AIRBORNE
IN TWO MINUTES...

08:45.525 --> 08:47.570
HE LOSES THE LEG.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.721
I'M HERE TO SEE
COLONEL DIYOZA.

09:07.764 --> 09:10.027
SORRY. ONLY
McCREARY AND THE DOC
ARE ALLOWED IN.

09:10.071 --> 09:13.814
WELL, THE DOC SENT ME.
SHE NEEDS HER MEDS.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.598
HORMONES FOR THE BABY.

09:15.642 --> 09:18.166
McCREARY ON P.A.: WHEELS UP
IN TWO MINUTES, BOYS AND GIRLS.

09:18.209 --> 09:22.083
TIME TO END THIS WAR.
STRAP IN.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.041
MAKE IT FAST.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.137
UHH!

09:35.662 --> 09:36.967
HELLO, CLARKE.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.055
I NEED TO GET
TO McCREARY

09:38.099 --> 09:39.709
AND KEEP THIS SHIP
ON THE GROUND.

09:39.753 --> 09:42.669
YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME.
TURN AROUND.

09:42.712 --> 09:45.846
IT'S HARD TO KEEP TRACK
OF WHOSE SIDE YOU'RE ON.

09:45.889 --> 09:48.762
I GUESS WE HAVE THAT
IN COMMON.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.590
I GUESS WE DO.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.506
LET'S GO.

09:56.726 --> 09:59.207
COMPUTER: ONE MINUTE TO LIFTOFF.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.386
SHAW: RAVEN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.649
HIT HIM AGAIN.

10:06.693 --> 10:07.998
SHAW: AAH!
RAVEN: LEAVE HIM ALONE!

10:08.042 --> 10:09.783
WE'RE READY FOR TAKEOFF,
ALL RIGHT?

10:09.826 --> 10:11.828
McCREARY: THAT'S ENOUGH.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.092
KUBA, WE'RE HEADING
YOUR WAY.

10:15.136 --> 10:17.791
WATCH THE FIREWORKS,
THEN COME HOME.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.444
TAKE US UP.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.316
WE'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

10:23.971 --> 10:26.364
RAVEN, CUT THE ENGINES.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.845
COPY THAT. ABOUT TIME.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.635
McCREARY: WHAT ARE
YOU GONNA DO?

10:35.678 --> 10:37.680
SHOOT A PREGNANT WOMAN?

10:37.724 --> 10:39.682
CLARKE: NO.
IF I DID THAT,

10:39.726 --> 10:42.119
YOUR BABY
MIGHT LIVE.

10:45.862 --> 10:49.736
I WON'T LET
MY CHILD DIE.
WILL YOU?

10:57.308 --> 11:00.398
I DON'T SEE ANY MISSILES.
THANK YOU, CLARKE.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.009
BELLAMY: NOW IT'S OUR TURN.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.364
MAN: SO MUCH FOR
McCREARY'S BACKUP.

11:09.407 --> 11:10.757
ALL POSITIONS, OPEN FIRE.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.674
KUBA ON RADIO:
AIM FOR THE ENGINE.

11:14.717 --> 11:17.154
WHEN THE CAR STOPS,
PULL OUT THE CANNONS!

11:17.198 --> 11:19.679
THEY CAN'T WIN.

11:21.332 --> 11:22.899
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.687
MAN: FIRE!

11:28.862 --> 11:30.167
SOMEONE EXPLAIN
TO ME WHY I'M NOT

11:30.211 --> 11:31.952
SHOOTING
THIS GATLING GUN.

11:31.995 --> 11:34.041
THIS IS MADI'S PLAN.
WE HAVE TO DRAW OUT
THE CANNONS.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.042
BY GIVING THEM
A BIG TARGET?

11:35.085 --> 11:36.347
YEAH, THAT'S
A GREAT PLAN.

11:36.391 --> 11:37.740
YE OF LITTLE FAITH.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.312
YOU WERE SAYING?

11:44.355 --> 11:45.313
BELLAMY:
WHAT'S WRONG?

11:45.356 --> 11:46.401
WE'RE NOT
CLOSE ENOUGH.

11:46.444 --> 11:47.402
WHY ARE
WE STOPPING?

11:47.445 --> 11:49.012
THEY GOT THE ENGINE.
DAMN IT!

11:49.056 --> 11:51.493
JOHN, GET AWAY
FROM THE WINDSHIELD!

11:53.234 --> 11:54.975
BELLAMY: TEN SECONDS,
FULL CHARGE.

11:55.018 --> 11:58.630
READY TO STRIKE. BIG GUN.
GO! NOW! BE HEROES.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.031
BELLAMY: DON'T HAVE A SHOT.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.250
ECHO: I DO.

12:15.865 --> 12:16.823
I NEED TO GET CLOSER.

12:16.866 --> 12:17.998
GET CLOSER.
I'LL COVER YOU.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.956
JOHN, JOHN,
YOU'LL GET HIT!

12:20.000 --> 12:21.915
MURPHY: I THOUGHT YOU
SAID YOU DIDN'T CARE.

12:21.958 --> 12:22.872
JOHN!

12:32.490 --> 12:34.231
ECHO: I'LL BE
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.320
IF YOU MISS,
I'LL NEVER LET YOU
LIVE IT DOWN.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.844
I WON'T MISS.

12:46.156 --> 12:48.332
MAN: MURPHY, CEASE FIRE!

12:53.860 --> 12:54.774
-UHH!
-UHH!

12:56.036 --> 12:57.602
AAH!

12:59.953 --> 13:01.911
STILL NO CANNON.

13:01.955 --> 13:03.347
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

13:09.353 --> 13:11.399
NOW WE WIN.

13:19.189 --> 13:20.408
IT WORKED.

13:26.893 --> 13:27.894
TAKE US HOME.

13:37.773 --> 13:40.297
KUBA ON RADIO: HERE THEY COME.
THERE'S TOO MANY.

13:40.341 --> 13:43.126
RETREAT. RETREAT!
GO BACK TO THE VILLAGE.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.259
IT'S OVER.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.217
TELL YOUR MEN TO
LOWER THEIR WEAPONS

13:47.261 --> 13:49.176
AND I'LL LOWER MINE.

13:49.219 --> 13:51.265
BOSS, WHAT DO WE DO HERE?

13:55.182 --> 13:57.880
IF SHE MOVES, SHOOT HER.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.452
CLARKE: DIYOZA,
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING?

14:04.495 --> 14:05.801
McCREARY...

14:08.151 --> 14:09.631
DIYOZA: McCREARY, NO.

14:12.025 --> 14:14.114
CLARKE, YOU HAVE
TO STOP HIM.

14:14.157 --> 14:16.551
HE'LL KILL US ALL.

14:16.594 --> 14:19.249
SHOOT HIM!
RIGHT NOW!

14:19.293 --> 14:22.165
SHAW: McCREARY,
YOU CAN'T BE THIS CRAZY.

14:22.209 --> 14:23.558
RAVEN: SHAW?
SHAW: IT WAS OUR PLAN

14:23.601 --> 14:25.125
FOR WHEN WE GOT BACK
TO EARTH ORBIT.

14:25.168 --> 14:28.171
WEAPONIZE THE HYTHYLODIUM TO
LEVERAGE OUR WAY TO THE GROUND.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.869
IT'LL DESTROY THE VALLEY.

14:29.912 --> 14:32.654
OK, OK.
MY WEAPON'S DOWN.

14:38.181 --> 14:40.444
IF I CAN'T HAVE
THIS VALLEY...

14:41.489 --> 14:43.012
NO ONE CAN.

14:47.277 --> 14:48.975
COMPUTER: CARGO AWAY.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.690
COMPUTER:
14 MINUTES TO IMPACT.

15:08.733 --> 15:11.649
WHAT WILL WE DO?

15:11.693 --> 15:13.216
YOU REALLY ARE INSANE.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.741
WHAT IS INSANE
ABOUT SELF

15:16.785 --> 15:18.656
IT'S HOW WE SAVE
OUR CHILD.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.006
RAVEN: WHATEVER.
HOW DO WE STOP IT?

15:20.049 --> 15:22.095
COMPUTER:
13 MINUTES TO IMPACT.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.966
WE DON'T.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.099
McCREARY: WE'RE ON A SHIP.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.144
TAKE US UP TO SPACE,
AND WE SURVIVE.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.058
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

15:29.102 --> 15:32.061
FOR HOW LONG
WITHOUT A PLANET?

15:32.105 --> 15:34.063
FOR AS LONG
AS WE HAVE TO.

15:34.107 --> 15:37.371
CLARKE: DO WHAT HE SAYS, SHAW.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.939
FLY THE SHIP.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.941
WHAT NO.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.204
MY FRIENDS.
OUR FRIENDS. MADI!

15:44.247 --> 15:46.032
CLARKE: DO YOU WANT
TO LIVE OR NOT?

15:46.075 --> 15:49.774
FLY THE DAMN SHIP
OR RAVEN GETS FRIED.

15:49.818 --> 15:54.214
DO IT, SHAW.
YOU GOT 3 SECONDS.

15:54.257 --> 15:58.522
3...2...1.

16:02.613 --> 16:03.527
OOH!

16:13.233 --> 16:14.930
COMPUTER:
12 MINUTES TO IMPACT.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.759
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW
YOUR DAUGHTER.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.636
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING
IN DISTANCE]

16:25.680 --> 16:26.811
MAN: HEAR THAT?

16:26.855 --> 16:28.291
MAN 2: WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

16:28.335 --> 16:31.816
MAN 3: SOUNDS LIKE IT'S
COMING FROM ALL SIDES.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.514
SOUNDS LIKE 100.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.300
WEAPONS DOWN!

16:39.259 --> 16:43.002
PUT YOUR WEAPONS
DOWN NOW.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.047
MAN: PUT YOUR
WEAPONS DOWN.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.879
HALT! HOLD YOUR FIRE.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.315
THEY SURRENDERED.
IT'S OVER.

16:52.359 --> 16:55.057
THEY KILLED HUNDREDS
OF OUR PEOPLE
IN THAT GORGE.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.886
THIS CAN'T BE WHAT THE FLAME
IS TELLING YOU TO DO.

16:57.929 --> 16:59.540
I DON'T NEED THE FLAME
TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO

16:59.583 --> 17:02.238
WITH A BUNCH OF
CRIMINALS WHO
INVADED MY HOME.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.675
WE'VE BEEN HERE
BEFORE, MADI.

17:04.719 --> 17:07.765
WE WERE THE CRIMINALS.
THE 100.

17:07.809 --> 17:10.768
WE LANDED IN
SOMEONE ELSE'S HOME,

17:10.812 --> 17:13.075
AND WE WENT TO WAR.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.164
YOU CAN EXECUTE THEM
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ENEMY

17:15.208 --> 17:17.819
OR YOU CAN
BREAK THE CYCLE.

17:17.862 --> 17:20.169
YOU CAN BE
BETTER THAN THEM.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.171
YOU CAN BE
BETTER THAN US.

17:28.090 --> 17:31.615
THE CHOICE IS YOURS, HEDA.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.231
ECHO: WHAT IS THAT?

17:38.274 --> 17:39.188
THE EVAC SIGNAL.

17:39.232 --> 17:41.147
IT MEANS CONDITIONS
ARE UNSAFE.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.191
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BUG OUT.

17:42.235 --> 17:43.453
RAVEN ON RADIO:
EVERYONE, LISTEN UP.

17:43.497 --> 17:46.108
LIFE AS WE KNOW IT
IS ABOUT TO END AGAIN.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.241
GET YOUR ASSES
TO THE TRANSPORT SHIP NOW

17:48.284 --> 17:49.938
FOR IMMEDIATE EVACUATION.

17:49.981 --> 17:51.026
MONTY ON RADIO:
RAVEN, IT'S MONTY.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.332
WE'RE TRANSPORTING THE WOUNDED.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.811
RAVEN ON RADIO:
THANK GOD, MONTY. HURRY!

17:53.855 --> 17:55.117
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
STOP A SECOND.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.379
MONTY: IT'S SLOW GOING.

17:56.423 --> 17:57.946
SO, PUTTING ASIDE
A THOUSAND OTHER QUESTIONS,

17:57.989 --> 17:58.947
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE?

17:58.990 --> 18:00.557
RAVEN ON RADIO: 9 MINUTES.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.646
WE'LL WAIT AS LONG AS WE CAN.

18:02.690 --> 18:03.952
DEJA VU.

18:03.995 --> 18:06.085
UGH! JUST GO.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.217
HE WON'T
MAKE IT.

18:08.261 --> 18:11.090
WE HAVE TO GO
WITHOUT HIM.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.308
SHOW THE OTHERS THE WAY.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.918
-OK.
-I'LL TAKE MURPHY.

18:13.962 --> 18:15.442
WE'LL BE RIGHT
BEHIND YOU.

18:17.313 --> 18:19.924
OK. FOLLOW ME!
3, 2, 1.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.883
JACKSON: GO, GO, GO!

18:24.059 --> 18:25.930
HE'S RIGHT.
JUST GO ON.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.281
IT'S TOO FAR.
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME.

18:28.324 --> 18:31.284
THEN I GUESS WE'RE
BOTH GONNA DIE,

18:31.327 --> 18:33.068
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
IN HELL I CAN LEAVE

18:33.112 --> 18:34.635
THE MAN I LOVE BEHIND.

18:37.855 --> 18:40.293
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA
DO THAT TO YOU, EMORI.
I CAN'T RUN.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.033
EMORI: YES, YOU CAN.
MONTY: NO...

18:43.078 --> 18:44.123
BUT I CAN.

18:44.166 --> 18:48.083
MONTY, WHAT--UHH!
MON--AAH!

19:47.098 --> 19:49.318
CLARKE: I'LL TELL YOU INSIDE.

19:49.362 --> 19:50.711
NO. NOT THEM.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.234
YES THEM.

19:52.278 --> 19:53.540
FIRST WE SAVE THEIR LIVES,

19:53.583 --> 19:55.759
THEN WE LET THEM PROVE
THEY DESERVE IT.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.198
THE COMMANDERS
TOLD YOU THAT?

19:59.241 --> 20:01.765
NO. BELLAMY.

20:04.986 --> 20:07.467
WHERE'S ABBY?
GAIA WILL NEED HER.

20:07.510 --> 20:08.772
SHE'S NOT WITH YOU?

20:10.513 --> 20:12.428
SHE WAS AT THE VILLAGE.
I'VE GOTTA GET HER.

20:12.472 --> 20:15.431
NO. WE LEFT A GROUP
TO GO DOOR TO DOOR.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.433
THEY'LL BRING HER IN.

20:17.477 --> 20:20.175

PUT HIM INSIDE NOW!

20:33.884 --> 20:36.235

20:36.278 --> 20:38.193
I NEED YOUR HELP.

20:47.594 --> 20:50.510

20:50.553 --> 20:53.339
I'M SORRY ABOUT KANE,
BUT IT'S TIME TO GO.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.559
NO. I WON'T LEAVE HIM.

21:00.520 --> 21:05.307
WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.
THIS IS NOT A CHOICE.

21:05.351 --> 21:06.569
YES, IT IS.

21:08.528 --> 21:11.226
SO, IT'S OK FOR ME
TO BE THE MONSTER,

21:11.270 --> 21:13.402
BUT NOT YOU?
IS THAT RIGHT?

21:13.446 --> 21:18.189
EAT OR DIE.
THAT WAS YOU, TOO.

21:18.233 --> 21:22.237
YES, IT WAS.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.717
AND HE KNEW.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.503
SO, GO AHEAD.

21:27.547 --> 21:30.332
STRIKE ME DOWN
OR GET THE HELL OUT.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.378
BECAUSE I'M SAVING
THE MAN THAT I LOVE.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.601
I HAVE
A BETTER IDEA.

PLEASE RESPOND.

22:01.537 --> 22:04.975
GUYS, IF WE WAIT MUCH LONGER,
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

22:09.719 --> 22:11.460
YOU HAVE
TO FORGIVE HER.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.549
NOW'S NOT
THE TIME, MADI.

22:13.593 --> 22:14.637
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

22:14.681 --> 22:16.378
HOW MUCH SHE CARES
ABOUT YOU?

22:16.422 --> 22:18.075
SO MUCH SHE
LEFT ME TO DIE

22:18.119 --> 22:19.512
IN A FIGHTING PIT.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.601
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.385
HOW MANY MISTAKES
DID YOU MAKE

22:23.429 --> 22:24.647
TO PROTECT THE CHILD
YOU LOVED?

22:26.345 --> 22:27.737
THAT WAS DIFFERENT.

22:27.781 --> 22:28.695
WAS IT?

22:30.261 --> 22:31.567
I SHOULDN'T
TELL YOU THIS,

22:31.611 --> 22:33.352
BUT WHEN YOU WERE
ON THE RING,

22:33.395 --> 22:34.483
SHE CALLED YOU
ON THE RADIO

22:34.527 --> 22:36.964

I DIDN'T KNOW.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.249
YOU COULDN'T HAVE.

UHH. JUST ONCE I'D LIKE

25:16.732 --> 25:18.429
THAT WASN'T ON FIRE.

25:45.935 --> 25:48.242
HOW'S MURPHY?

25:48.285 --> 25:49.939
JACKSON GOT
BOTH BULLETS.

25:49.983 --> 25:52.420
HE'LL BE OK.

25:52.463 --> 25:54.683
COCKROACHES ARE
HARD TO KILL.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.642
EMORI'S

25:57.730 --> 25:59.993

KEEP HER LEG.

26:02.517 --> 26:03.779
KANE?

26:05.041 --> 26:07.870
THEY PUT HIM IN
A DRUG-INDUCED COMA.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.524
I'M NOT SURE WHY,
BUT JACKSON SAYS

26:09.568 --> 26:11.221
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
OF THE DRUG

26:11.265 --> 26:12.962
TO KEEP HIM
THAT WAY FOR LONG.

26:13.006 --> 26:14.703
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

26:19.403 --> 26:22.145
WHAT IF HE
DIDN'T NEED THE DRUG?

26:22.189 --> 26:24.365
I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT CRYOSLEEP,

26:24.408 --> 26:25.714
BUT AT LEAST IT WILL
KEEP HIM ALIVE.

26:25.758 --> 26:29.631
THAT'S BRILLIANT.
I'LL TELL MY MOM.

26:29.675 --> 26:34.375
HEY. WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED,
COME TO THE BRIDGE.

26:34.418 --> 26:37.813
WE'RE DECIDING THE FATE
OF THE HUMAN RACE. AGAIN.

26:37.857 --> 26:39.554
YOU SHOULD BE THERE.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.167
YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME
FOR LEAVING YOU IN POLIS?

26:46.039 --> 26:48.563
THE COMMANDER
ORDERED ME NOT TO BE.

26:51.740 --> 26:54.090
I'LL MEET YOU
ON THE BRIDGE.

27:17.592 --> 27:20.334
CHEER UP.
I WASN'T INVITED, EITHER.

27:30.213 --> 27:34.261
AHH.

27:34.304 --> 27:36.611
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR MISTAKE WAS.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.744
NOT KILLING YOU THE DAY
YOU OPENED THE BUNKER?

27:38.787 --> 27:42.051
THAT, TOO.

27:42.095 --> 27:44.575
BUT THEN WHAT KIND OF
LESSON WOULD THAT BE?

27:46.708 --> 27:50.843
YOUR MISTAKE
WAS LIKING IT. POWER.

27:53.323 --> 27:55.717
IT'S THE KISS OF DEATH.

27:57.893 --> 28:00.679
THAT'S OK.
I LIKED IT, TOO.

28:04.813 --> 28:09.078
ONE GARDEN,
TWO SERPENTS.

28:11.907 --> 28:14.475
EDEN NEVER
STOOD A CHANCE.

28:25.007 --> 28:27.923
IT'S GONE, GUYS.

28:27.967 --> 28:30.752
EMORI: CLOSE IT UP, SHAW.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.015
LIKE OUR ANCESTORS
ON THE ARK,

28:33.059 --> 28:35.104
WE'RE THE LAST
OF THE HUMAN RACE.

28:35.148 --> 28:38.325
OUR ANCESTORS WERE WRONG.
WE'RE NOT.

28:38.368 --> 28:40.849
412 PEOPLE

28:40.893 --> 28:43.896
THANKS TO MADI, WE SAVED
WHO COULD BE SAVED.

28:43.939 --> 28:46.028
NOW IT'S OUR JOB
TO KEEP THEM ALIVE.

28:46.072 --> 28:48.770
HOW DO WE DO THAT?

28:50.946 --> 28:53.775
-OH, FLOAT ME NOW.

28:56.647 --> 28:58.388
CAN I...?

28:58.432 --> 29:00.695
YEAH.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.784
SHAW: FROM WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT
THE HALF-LIFE OF HYTHYLODIUM,

29:02.828 --> 29:06.832
IT'LL BE AT LEAST 10 YEARS
BEFORE THAT VALLEY COMES BACK.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.964
THIS SHIP DOES HAVE
A SMALL WATER RECYCLER

29:09.008 --> 29:11.924
AND A FEW WEEKS' WORTH OF
RATIONS, BUT THAT'S IT.

29:11.967 --> 29:14.448
CRYO IS THE ONLY OPTION.

29:14.491 --> 29:16.015
THERE ARE 500 PODS, WHICH IS

29:16.058 --> 29:17.799
MORE THAN ENOUGH
FOR WHAT WE NEED.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.018
RAVEN: I AGREE WITH SHAW.

29:19.061 --> 29:20.497
THE TECH IS AMAZING.

29:20.541 --> 29:21.977
WE GO TO SLEEP,
WE DON'T AGE,

29:22.021 --> 29:24.066
WE WAKE THE NEXT MORNING,
IT'S 10 YEARS LATER.

29:24.110 --> 29:25.676
AND BOB'S YOUR UNCLE.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.113
I THOUGHT YOU HATED
THAT PHRASE.

29:27.156 --> 29:29.071
IT'S GROWING ON ME.

29:29.115 --> 29:30.899
BELLAMY:
IT'S UP TO YOU, MADI.

29:38.689 --> 29:40.953
OK.

29:40.996 --> 29:42.955
I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR BED.

29:48.351 --> 29:52.834
CLARKE: ALL RIGHT, MADI,
WE'RE ALL SET.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.231
WILL WE DREAM?

29:58.274 --> 30:00.886
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT IF WE DO,

30:00.929 --> 30:02.713
I'LL SEE YOU IN MINE.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.677
COME ON.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.248
OK.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.819
YOU READY?

30:32.221 --> 30:34.833
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, MADI.

30:43.058 --> 30:45.452
BELLAMY:
OK. YOUR TURN.

30:50.109 --> 30:53.590
KIND OF LIKE CLOSING
THE DOOR IN THE FLOOR.

30:56.115 --> 30:58.378
KIND OF LIKE THAT.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.904
WAIT.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.956
I LOVE YOU, BIG BROTHER.

31:15.177 --> 31:17.440
I KNOW YOU LOVE
ME, TOO.

31:21.967 --> 31:25.144
DON'T MAKE ME WAIT 10
YEARS TO HEAR YOU SAY IT.

31:28.147 --> 31:29.931
YOU'RE MY SISTER,

31:29.975 --> 31:32.934
AND A PART OF ME
WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

31:41.638 --> 31:45.077
DOES THE OTHER PART
STILL WISH I WAS DEAD?

31:47.557 --> 31:54.129
THE OTHER PART WISHES
A PART OF YOU WAS. YEAH.

31:54.173 --> 31:56.305
THAT'S FAIR.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.746
IT WON'T FEEL LIKE
10 YEARS.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.443
HEY.

33:30.486 --> 33:32.880
HEY.

33:34.229 --> 33:36.014
UHH.

33:40.105 --> 33:42.150
WHY IS IT JUST US?

33:43.717 --> 33:47.286
MALE VOICE: THAT'S THE WAY
MOM AND DAD WANTED IT.

33:48.896 --> 33:51.681
UH...CAN I JUST SAY, WOW.

33:51.725 --> 33:53.901
I MEAN, I CAN'T
TELL YOU HOW GOOD

33:53.944 --> 33:55.598
IT IS TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

33:55.642 --> 33:58.645
WEIRD BUT GOOD.
GREAT, ACTUALLY.

33:58.688 --> 34:00.081
WHO ARE YOU?

34:00.125 --> 34:01.300
MY NAME. RIGHT.

34:01.343 --> 34:03.302
I DIDN'T TELL YOU
MY NAME. SORRY.

34:03.345 --> 34:07.132
I'VE NEVER MET
ANYONE BEFORE,

34:07.175 --> 34:09.003
SO, I CLEARLY
SUCK AT IT.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.092
HEH HEH.

34:11.136 --> 34:15.662
I'M JORDAN,
MONTY AND HARPER'S SON.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.321
THEY DIDN'T GO TO SLEEP.

34:22.364 --> 34:25.237
THEY TALKED ABOUT YOUR
TIME ON THE RING A LOT.

34:25.280 --> 34:28.153
TOO MUCH, ACTUALLY.

34:28.196 --> 34:30.633
HOW HAPPY
THEY WERE THERE.

34:30.677 --> 34:33.767
I GUESS THEY WANTED
TO GET BACK TO THAT.

34:33.810 --> 34:35.160
GET DRESSED AND COME
TO THE BRIDGE.

34:35.203 --> 34:36.726
DAD LEFT
EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS.

34:36.770 --> 34:39.033
WAKE CLARKE
AND BELLAMY FIRST.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.643
PLAY THEM THE MESSAGE.

34:42.254 --> 34:44.038
HEY, WAIT.

34:45.213 --> 34:48.608
HOW LONG WERE WE ASLEEP?

34:50.349 --> 34:52.481
125 YEARS.

34:55.745 --> 34:58.139
MONTY ON VIDEO: HEY, GUYS,
IT'S BEEN ABOUT A YEAR

34:58.183 --> 35:00.185
SINCE YOU ALL WENT TO BED.

35:00.228 --> 35:01.882
NOT MUCH TO REPORT, REALLY.

35:01.925 --> 35:05.842
MY ALGAE FARM IS AWESOME.
NO SURPRISE THERE.

35:05.886 --> 35:08.193
OH. I'M ABLE TO MONITOR
CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND

35:08.236 --> 35:10.499
USING THE SHIP'S
GEOLOGIC EQUIPMENT, SO,

35:10.543 --> 35:14.112
I'LL KNOW WHEN IT'S SAFE
FOR US TO GO BACK DOWN.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.244
GETS A LITTLE LONELY SOMETIMES
WITHOUT THE REST OF YOU,

35:16.288 --> 35:18.246
BUT THE PEACE AND QUIET
IS WHAT--

35:18.290 --> 35:19.769
HARPER: MONTY,
I'VE BEEN WAITING.

35:19.813 --> 35:21.380
HARPER, WAIT.
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF--

35:21.423 --> 35:23.512
HARPER: YOU PROMISED ME.

35:23.556 --> 35:26.733
WE HAVE ANOTHER 40
STATEROOMS THAT--

35:26.776 --> 35:28.778
HA HA!
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

35:28.822 --> 35:33.043
UH...NOT A LOT TO DO IN SPACE.
AHEM.

35:33.087 --> 35:35.220
I SO DIDN'T NEED
TO SEE THAT.

35:39.441 --> 35:40.964
HEY, AGAIN.

35:41.008 --> 35:43.837
TODAY'S THE TWO-YEAR ANNIVERSARY
OF THE LONG NAP.

35:43.880 --> 35:47.014
HARPER'S BEEN EATING
A LITTLE TOO MUCH ALGAE.

35:47.057 --> 35:50.148
HILARIOUS.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.846
HEY, GUYS, UM, SURPRISE.

35:52.889 --> 35:57.198
HA! OHH. WE PICKED
A NAME TODAY.

35:57.242 --> 36:01.333
BOY OR GIRL--JORDAN.

36:01.376 --> 36:03.900
MONTY: I THINK JASPER
WOULD LIKE THAT.

36:03.944 --> 36:07.556
ANYWAY, STILL NO SIGN
THE GROUND IS
COMING BACK.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.428
I WOULDN'T EXPECT IT
THIS SOON,

36:09.471 --> 36:10.646
SO, I'M NOT WORRIED.

36:10.690 --> 36:12.953
WE'LL CHECK BACK IN
NEXT TIME THERE'S NEWS.

36:15.825 --> 36:19.351
MONTY: MEET
JORDAN JASPER GREEN.

36:25.139 --> 36:29.361
SHH. THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.

36:29.404 --> 36:30.797
HARPER'S RESTING.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.452
WE'RE BOTH GOOD,
THOUGH. OH, SHH.

36:33.495 --> 36:36.368
HE'LL BE 8 WHEN
YOU MEET HIM.

36:36.411 --> 36:39.197
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOUR FACES.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.372
HI.

36:41.503 --> 36:44.332
THINGS DIDN'T GO
AS PLANNED.

36:44.376 --> 36:46.465
MONTY ON VIDEO:
HAPPY WAKE-UP DAY.

36:46.508 --> 36:47.901
10 YEARS.

36:47.944 --> 36:49.381
AND SINCE YOU'RE WATCHING THIS
SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE,

36:49.424 --> 36:53.863
YOU KNOW NOW THAT...
THAT I DIDN'T WAKE YOU UP.

36:53.907 --> 36:56.126
THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S
STILL NOTHING DOWN THERE.

36:56.170 --> 36:57.693
I'M WORKING THE PROBLEM.

37:01.958 --> 37:05.440
I'VE TOLD HARPER IT'S TO BE
EXPECTED, BUT, UM...

37:05.484 --> 37:07.268
WELL, THAT'S A LIE.

37:07.312 --> 37:08.878
THIS IS GONNA TAKE A WHILE.

37:08.922 --> 37:12.186
JORDAN IS DOING GREAT, THOUGH.
HE'S A HAPPY KID.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.276
I TOOK A PAGE FROM CLARKE'S
PARENTING BOOK.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.104
HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT YOU GUYS.

37:17.147 --> 37:21.369
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
MURPHY'S HIS FAVORITE.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.632
IT WAS
A REBELLIOUS PHASE.

37:23.676 --> 37:26.809
MONTY ON VIDEO: ANYWAY,
IT'S GONNA BE A WHILE.

37:26.853 --> 37:29.029
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
IF THINGS CHANGE.

37:29.986 --> 37:32.598
HEY, GUYS, IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME

37:32.641 --> 37:34.469
SINCE WE RECORDED ONE OF THESE.

37:34.513 --> 37:37.037
WE JUST PUT JORDAN IN CRYO.

37:39.169 --> 37:40.519
HE'S A GOOD BOY.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.260
HARPER: SMART
LIKE HIS FATHER.

37:42.303 --> 37:44.523
MONTY:
AND KIND LIKE HIS MOM.

37:44.566 --> 37:48.614
WE CHOSE THIS LIFE.
HE DIDN'T.

37:51.356 --> 37:52.487
HEY.

37:56.970 --> 37:59.059
IF YOU'RE WATCHING
THIS, KIDDO...

38:01.061 --> 38:03.498
WE LOVE YOU
SO MUCH.

38:03.542 --> 38:05.283
DID YOU FOLLOW
MY INSTRUCTIONS?

38:08.373 --> 38:11.289
ASSUMING HE DID.

38:11.332 --> 38:14.901
HEY, BELLAMY,
HEY, CLARKE.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.468
WE WANTED HIM
TO WAKE YOU FIRST

38:16.511 --> 38:18.296
SO WE COULD TALK.

38:18.339 --> 38:22.735
EARTH...
ISN'T COMING BACK.

38:23.997 --> 38:26.956
YOU'VE BEEN ASLEEP
FOR OVER 28 YEARS

38:27.000 --> 38:29.916
AND IT'S AS DEAD
AS THE DAY WE LEFT.

38:29.959 --> 38:32.266
I'M WORKING ON
A PLAN "B," THOUGH.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.618
IF YOU'RE AWAKE,
THAT MEANS I FOUND IT.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.752
I'LL SEE YOU AGAIN
WHEN I DO.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.451
WAIT. NOT YET.

38:48.456 --> 38:50.415
TAKE CARE OF OUR BOY.

39:08.476 --> 39:11.523
MONTY ON VIDEO: JORDAN...

39:11.566 --> 39:14.003
YOUR MOTHER DIED TODAY.

39:14.047 --> 39:17.485
SHE WAS PRETTY SICK
THE LAST FEW YEARS.

39:17.529 --> 39:21.010
CLARKE, YOU WERE RIGHT.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.839
HER DAD'S GENETIC CONDITION
FINALLY GOT HER.

39:27.539 --> 39:32.457
WE HAD A GOOD LIFE.
SOMETIMES...

39:32.500 --> 39:34.894
I KNOW SHE WANTED
TO BE WITH YOU GUYS.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.288
MAYBE I DID, TOO.

39:40.595 --> 39:42.031
BUT IF WE DID THAT...

39:43.816 --> 39:47.559
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO SHOW YOU THIS. SON.

39:57.917 --> 40:01.355
IT TOOK ME 30 YEARS,
BUT I FINALLY CRACKED

40:01.399 --> 40:03.662
THE ELIGIUS THREE MISSION FILE.

40:03.705 --> 40:06.491
TURNS OUT IT WASN'T
A MINING MISSION.

40:06.534 --> 40:09.189
AFTER SUCKING THE EARTH DRY
OF OIL,

40:09.232 --> 40:11.887
THEY WENT LOOKING
FOR ANOTHER PLANET TO TAP.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.943
TWO SUNS?

40:23.986 --> 40:25.901
MONTY ON VIDEO: I SET
THE COORDINATES A WEEK AGO.

40:25.945 --> 40:30.863
IF I'M RIGHT, YOU SHOULD
GET THERE IN...75 YEARS.

40:32.734 --> 40:36.216
I'M TEMPTED TO PUT MYSELF
IN CRYO TO SEE IT, BUT

40:36.259 --> 40:37.739
WITHOUT HARPER...

40:40.525 --> 40:45.573
ANYWAY,
IT'S IN THE GOLDILOCKS ZONE

40:45.617 --> 40:47.401
OF A BINARY STAR SYSTEM.

40:48.707 --> 40:50.926
BUT THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

40:50.970 --> 40:53.538
ELIGIUS THREE
NEVER RADIOED BACK

40:53.581 --> 40:56.758
OR, IF THEY DID, IT WAS
AFTER APOCALYPSE ONE,

40:56.802 --> 40:58.673
SO, NO ONE HEARD IT.

41:00.588 --> 41:05.201
CAN YOU SEE IT?
IS IT BEAUTIFUL?

41:07.552 --> 41:09.554
IT IS IN MY DREAMS.

41:12.557 --> 41:15.168
I HOPE WE DO BETTER THERE.

41:15.211 --> 41:17.344
I HOPE JASPER WAS WRONG

41:17.387 --> 41:19.172
AND WE AREN'T THE PROBLEM.

41:19.215 --> 41:22.654
I HOPE YOUR LIVES THERE WILL BE
AS HAPPY AS MINE HAS BEEN.

41:24.612 --> 41:26.353
BE THE GOOD GUYS.

41:29.617 --> 41:31.967
MAY WE MEET AGAIN.

41:32.011 --> 41:33.795
BELLAMY AND CLARKE:
MAY WE MEET AGAIN.
