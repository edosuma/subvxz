NARRATOR:
<i>Kids, this is a story of landmarks.</i>

00:03.927 --> 00:05.661
<i>There are certain moments in</i>
<i>life when you have to decide</i>

00:05.662 --> 00:07.930
<i>which things you can stand</i>
<i>to see torn down,</i>

00:07.931 --> 00:10.833
<i>and which things you have</i>
<i>to preserve, no matter what.</i>

00:10.834 --> 00:13.068
<i>Such a moment came</i>
<i>for all of us</i>

00:13.069 --> 00:16.639
<i>in May of 2011,</i>
<i>at a special meeting of the</i>

00:16.640 --> 00:18.240
<i>New York City Landmarks</i>
<i>Preservation Commission,</i>

00:18.241 --> 00:19.274
where the fate of The Arcadian

00:19.275 --> 00:20.776
<i>would be decided</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

00:20.777 --> 00:24.246
A symbol of strength
and constancy,

00:24.247 --> 00:25.714
the stone lion of The Arcadian

00:25.715 --> 00:28.450
has watched over
New Yorkers for generations.

00:28.451 --> 00:29.618
So remember:

00:29.619 --> 00:33.088
if the lion head stonework
is regal,

00:33.089 --> 00:37.226
then tearing it down
should be illegal.

00:37.927 --> 00:39.094
(cheering)
MARSHALL: Well...

00:39.095 --> 00:41.063
Did you like that?
All right, uh...

00:41.064 --> 00:44.266
We must make sure
the lion is always there.

00:44.267 --> 00:48.971
Destroy The Arcadian?
Oh, no, don't you dare.

00:52.025 --> 00:53.809
Yeah? Yeah? Okay.

00:53.810 --> 00:55.177
Try this one on for size...

00:55.178 --> 00:58.714
If you want New York's history
at your beck and call...

00:58.715 --> 01:00.683
All right, thank you,
Mr. Eriksen.

01:00.684 --> 01:02.001
I just have...

01:04.620 --> 01:07.873
MODERATOR:
We will now hear from the architect

01:07.874 --> 01:09.625
of the proposed GNB Tower,

01:09.626 --> 01:12.127
Ted Mosby.

01:13.263 --> 01:14.897
(audience cheering)
MODERATOR: Now, uh,

01:14.898 --> 01:17.599
Mr. Mosby, let's just
cut right to the chase.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.269
Do you think The Arcadian
should be a landmark?

01:20.270 --> 01:24.306
(intense music starts
and swells)

01:24.331 --> 01:29.881
(music cuts off)

01:31.063 --> 01:34.399
Okay, it's killing me. What
rhymes with "beck and call?"

01:35.017 --> 01:36.585
Wrecking ball.

01:36.586 --> 01:38.454
Don't go swinging
no wrecking ball.

01:38.455 --> 01:41.206
AUDIENCE:
Ah...

01:41.207 --> 01:43.025
Thank you.

01:55.755 --> 01:57.973
Mr. Mosby,

01:57.974 --> 02:00.576
do you think The Arcadian
should be a landmark?

02:00.577 --> 02:01.910
It's not a difficult question.

02:01.911 --> 02:04.046
NARRATOR: <i>Actually, it</i> was
<i>a difficult question.</i>

02:04.047 --> 02:06.448
<i>Of course, had he asked me</i>
<i>a few days earlier,</i>

02:06.449 --> 02:08.383
<i>I would have</i>
<i>immediately said...</i>

02:08.383 --> 02:11.270
"Yes. The Arcadian
should be a landmark."

02:11.271 --> 02:13.655
And then the crowd
gasps: "Oh, my God!

02:13.656 --> 02:14.990
"Did he really
just say that?

02:14.991 --> 02:16.258
"Oh, heavens!

02:16.259 --> 02:17.493
"Oh, my stars!

02:17.494 --> 02:19.361
I must clutch
my pearls!"

02:19.362 --> 02:22.598
So these things are generally
attended by old Southern ladies?

02:22.599 --> 02:24.666
Almost exclusively.
But here's my point:

02:24.667 --> 02:28.370
If they ask GNB's chief
architect-- aka me--

02:28.371 --> 02:31.540
if The Arcadian should be a
landmark, and I say "yes"?

02:31.541 --> 02:33.342
(mimes building blowing up)

02:34.477 --> 02:36.812
That, no, that wasn't The
Arcadian being destroyed;

02:36.813 --> 02:38.964
that was GNB's hopes of
destroying The Arcadian.

02:38.965 --> 02:40.186
I'm sorry, I should
have been more clear.

02:40.187 --> 02:41.017
Yeah.

02:41.025 --> 02:42.925
The Arcadian's gonna
be all like...

02:43.620 --> 02:45.587
Nice.
(chuckles)

02:45.588 --> 02:47.189
I have a message from Barney.

02:47.190 --> 02:48.690
NARRATOR:
<i>Things between Barney</i>

02:48.691 --> 02:51.760
<i>and the rest of us</i>
<i>had gotten a little frosty.</i>

02:51.761 --> 02:53.428
<i>First this happened.</i>

02:53.429 --> 02:57.166
Meet the new lawyer I hired
to help save The Arcadian.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.301
<i>And then this happened.</i>

02:59.302 --> 03:01.203
What kind of dirtbag

03:01.204 --> 03:04.139
doesn't stand by his best
friends, but instead,

03:04.140 --> 03:06.842
sides with some
self-righteous bitch

03:06.843 --> 03:09.028
with a pointless cause
and a megaphone?!

03:09.112 --> 03:11.046
TED: Dude!
That's my girlfriend.

03:11.447 --> 03:13.081
And ya know what?

03:13.082 --> 03:16.018
I'm on her side now, too.

03:16.019 --> 03:17.719
NARRATOR:
<i>Which led to this happening.</i>

03:17.720 --> 03:19.721
Message from Barney?
That's my cue to leave.

03:19.722 --> 03:21.106
Good night, guys.

03:21.107 --> 03:23.392
- I love you.
- Mmm. Love you, too.

03:23.393 --> 03:24.860
Good night.
Good night.

03:24.861 --> 03:26.028
All right,
what's the message?

03:26.029 --> 03:27.296
'Cause if it's another
hypothetical

03:27.297 --> 03:29.898
yet eerily accurate
drawing of my boobs...

03:29.899 --> 03:33.268
Yeah, I have that, too.

03:34.137 --> 03:35.671
Damn it.

03:35.672 --> 03:38.440
All right, here's the message.
(clears throat)

03:38.441 --> 03:41.009
"Oh, hey, guys.
Didn't see you there.

03:41.010 --> 03:43.645
"I was too busy
feelin' fine and..."

03:43.646 --> 03:45.614
Really?

03:48.885 --> 03:52.120
(sighs) "Feelin' fine
and gettin' some 'jine."

03:53.223 --> 03:55.390
ROBIN: "You may have
noticed the giant plate

03:55.391 --> 03:57.342
"of hot wings in front of me.

03:57.343 --> 03:59.294
"I know how much
you love hot wings.

03:59.295 --> 04:00.996
"Too bad someone
bribed the kitchen

04:00.997 --> 04:02.931
"to take them
off the menu tonight.

04:02.932 --> 04:04.216
"So, if you want some,

04:04.217 --> 04:07.603
"you're going to have
to come back to GNB.

04:07.604 --> 04:09.037
"But hurry, this offer

04:09.038 --> 04:11.506
will be gone lickety-split."

04:15.879 --> 04:17.946
"Do evil laugh."

04:17.947 --> 04:19.248
Oh, um...

04:19.249 --> 04:22.584
(meek impression of Barney's laugh)
(silent laugh)

04:23.686 --> 04:24.870
So, what are you turds up to?

04:24.871 --> 04:27.890
Oh, we've got the big
LPC meeting in two days.

04:27.891 --> 04:29.524
I have my whole
presentation worked out.

04:29.525 --> 04:31.927
I just need to find a
good rhyme to end on.

04:31.928 --> 04:32.995
Why does it need to rhyme?

04:32.996 --> 04:33.995
Mm.

04:33.996 --> 04:36.565
If you end an argument
with a rhyme,

04:36.859 --> 04:38.799
it's convincing <i>all</i> the time.
- Yeah.

04:38.801 --> 04:40.202
It's why in
our apartment:

04:40.203 --> 04:42.204
If you're a-hopin'
to score,

04:42.205 --> 04:44.106
don't leave your socks
on the floor.

04:44.107 --> 04:45.941
And she hasn't since.
No.

04:45.942 --> 04:47.943
Okay, okay.
A couple of things.

04:47.944 --> 04:49.578
Lily, how'd I do?
Nailed it.

04:49.579 --> 04:50.596
(dry chuckle)

04:50.597 --> 04:51.914
Secondly, Ted,

04:51.915 --> 04:53.865
I'm sorry I said
mean things about Zoey.

04:53.866 --> 04:56.551
Are you really going to walk
away from this project

04:56.552 --> 04:57.753
just because you're mad at me?

04:57.754 --> 04:59.788
It's not because
I'm mad at you.

04:59.789 --> 05:02.057
Barney, The Arcadian
was designed

05:02.058 --> 05:03.592
by a guy named
John Clifford Larrabee.

05:03.593 --> 05:05.560
And even though he's been dead
for half a century,

05:05.561 --> 05:07.913
it's my duty,
architect to architect,

05:07.914 --> 05:09.031
to keep his work alive.

05:09.032 --> 05:11.934
Please tell me a little
part of you understands.

05:11.935 --> 05:14.136
I understand.

05:14.137 --> 05:17.606
Zoey has magic lady bits.
What?

05:17.607 --> 05:19.741
Zoey's lady bits...

05:19.742 --> 05:22.577
are magic, and that's
how she controls your mind.

05:22.578 --> 05:25.113
You see,
every few hundred millennia,

05:25.114 --> 05:27.215
lady bits leap forward...
I know

05:27.216 --> 05:28.450
you're only just
getting started,

05:28.451 --> 05:30.319
but this is
already gross.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.055
I once knew such a girl.

05:33.056 --> 05:35.424
BARNEY:
<i>It was last call.</i>

05:35.425 --> 05:36.725
<i>In this very bar.</i>

05:40.363 --> 05:43.098
What...?!

05:43.099 --> 05:45.767
No...

05:45.768 --> 05:48.503
What?!

05:48.504 --> 05:50.672
No...

05:50.673 --> 05:53.241
What?!

05:53.242 --> 05:55.377
Um...

05:55.378 --> 05:59.581
thank you for, um, not using
a first name in that story.

06:01.818 --> 06:04.619
Barney, this is
about the building.

06:04.620 --> 06:06.855
Come on. This is so
about the girl.

06:06.856 --> 06:09.324
Okay, fine.
It's about the girl!

06:09.325 --> 06:11.426
I am doing this for Zoey!

06:11.427 --> 06:12.761
I'm in love with her.

06:12.762 --> 06:16.198
Look, I know it's early,
but there's a very good chance

06:16.199 --> 06:18.183
Zoey might be the mother
of my children.

06:18.184 --> 06:21.003
So, in addition to doing this
for John Clifford Larrabee,

06:21.004 --> 06:23.021
I'm also doing this
for Luke and Leia.

06:23.022 --> 06:25.941
Wait. She's gonna let you
name your kids Luke and Leia?

06:25.942 --> 06:27.909
Not if I knock down her favorite
building, she isn't.

06:27.910 --> 06:29.310
Barney, I'm sorry.

06:29.311 --> 06:31.697
Oh, you're not sorry now,
Ted Mosby.

06:31.698 --> 06:33.482
But you will be.

06:33.483 --> 06:37.586
You... will... be.

06:37.587 --> 06:41.623
(evil laugh)

06:41.624 --> 06:43.658
(laughing harder and louder)

06:43.659 --> 06:45.143
That's how you do an evil laugh.

06:45.144 --> 06:46.928
<i>Ciao</i> for now.

06:48.131 --> 06:50.065
NARRATOR:
<i>Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs,</i>

06:50.066 --> 06:52.434
<i>Barney and Marshall's</i>
<i>old boss at GNB?</i>

06:52.435 --> 06:54.803
Well, Arthur was going through
<i>a divorce and taking it</i>

06:54.804 --> 06:56.071
<i>kind of hard.</i>
Hi, Arthur.

06:56.072 --> 06:58.573
(sighs)
Everything okay?

06:58.574 --> 07:00.308
No, everything's not okay.

07:00.309 --> 07:03.745
My stupid wife got
custody of Tugboat.

07:03.746 --> 07:05.147
God, I should have
kept her hidden

07:05.148 --> 07:07.149
in a cage in the basement.

07:07.150 --> 07:09.084
Isn't that animal cruelty?

07:09.085 --> 07:10.986
I'm talking about my wife.

07:10.987 --> 07:13.422
Oh. That's fine, then.

07:14.407 --> 07:18.133
So listen, you know Ted,
the architect?

07:18.261 --> 07:19.861
Yeah, I know your friend Ted.
So,

07:19.862 --> 07:22.164
if Ted stood up at
that big meeting tomorrow

07:22.165 --> 07:25.700
and said that he thought The
Arcadian <i>should</i> be a landmark...

07:25.701 --> 07:27.936
you wouldn't just fire him,
would you?

07:27.937 --> 07:30.872
(laughs uncomfortably):
Right?

07:30.873 --> 07:32.240
You wouldn't just...

07:32.241 --> 07:33.375
You wouldn't just... yeah...

07:33.376 --> 07:35.844
No, Barney.
I wouldn't <i>just</i> fire him.

07:35.845 --> 07:38.046
I'd also fire you.

07:39.449 --> 07:40.949
Come again for Big Fudge?

07:45.023 --> 07:47.957
Can you believe that?!
I can't be unemployed, Robin!

07:47.996 --> 07:50.598
My job is my identity;
It's who I am.

07:50.599 --> 07:52.600
It gives me
the confidence I need

07:52.601 --> 07:55.003
to convince girls
I'm a fighter pilot.

07:55.004 --> 07:56.871
I-I don't understand.

07:56.872 --> 07:58.673
Why would he fire <i>you?</i>

07:58.674 --> 07:59.974
I don't understand.

07:59.975 --> 08:01.175
Why would you fire me?

08:01.176 --> 08:03.544
Have you already forgotten
how Mosby got that job?

08:03.545 --> 08:06.581
By being
the best architect available?

08:06.582 --> 08:08.182
No.

08:08.183 --> 08:11.185
By... being Latino?

08:11.186 --> 08:14.322
No. Let me refresh your memory.

08:14.323 --> 08:16.190
We were in this very room.

08:16.191 --> 08:18.226
Guys, I'm telling you,

08:18.227 --> 08:22.397
if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic,
fire me.

08:22.398 --> 08:24.132
Damn it!

08:24.133 --> 08:25.533
I was kidding?

08:25.534 --> 08:26.868
I'm not kidding!

08:26.869 --> 08:28.803
Oh, by the way, Arthur,

08:28.804 --> 08:30.171
uh, how are things
with you and your wife?

08:30.172 --> 08:31.339
Really good.

08:31.340 --> 08:33.374
In fact, I just put
all my assets in her name.

08:33.375 --> 08:35.309
Smartest thing I've ever done.

08:35.311 --> 08:37.010
BOTH: Damn it!
No,

08:37.011 --> 08:39.647
you'd better make sure Mosby
doesn't screw up tomorrow.

08:39.648 --> 08:41.616
Because either
that building is going down,

08:41.616 --> 08:43.952
or <i>you're</i> going down.

08:43.953 --> 08:45.386
TED:
<i>They're going</i>

08:45.387 --> 08:46.955
to fire him? That sucks.
He loves that job.

08:46.956 --> 08:50.191
And he's been doing it
for years.

08:50.192 --> 08:52.360
Okay, what does Barney
do at GNB?

08:52.361 --> 08:54.629
No idea.
He has a lot of keys.

08:54.630 --> 08:56.731
Okay, Ted, can you just please
think about this before you...

08:56.732 --> 08:57.865
There's nothing to think about.

08:57.866 --> 08:59.267
I-I can't lose Zoey.

08:59.268 --> 09:01.035
That's the only thing
that matters to me right now.

09:01.036 --> 09:02.403
Okay, Ted...

09:02.404 --> 09:03.838
you know I love Zoey.

09:03.839 --> 09:06.474
But, look, sometimes...

09:06.475 --> 09:07.909
I go play chess in the park.

09:07.910 --> 09:09.877
And the key to chess...

09:09.878 --> 09:12.380
Okay, I play online.

09:12.381 --> 09:15.383
But the key to chess...
Okay, it's Angry Birds!

09:16.218 --> 09:17.719
But the key to Angry Birds

09:17.720 --> 09:21.089
is to always try to see
every possible outcome.

09:21.090 --> 09:23.157
And to... hit some pigs
with rocks or something.

09:23.158 --> 09:25.827
I don't know; I don't play.
I can't get it to download.

09:26.829 --> 09:29.330
The point is,
this thing with you and Zoey?

09:29.331 --> 09:32.066
I can see it going
three possible ways.

09:32.067 --> 09:33.634
There's the first scenario.

09:33.635 --> 09:35.203
ROBIN:
<i>The chairman asks you...</i>

09:35.204 --> 09:37.127
Do you think The Arcadian
should be a landmark?

09:37.128 --> 09:38.473
<i>You say...</i>
No.

09:38.474 --> 09:40.051
And Zoey dumps you on the spot.

09:40.159 --> 09:42.777
We're done here.

09:42.778 --> 09:44.479
There's the second scenario.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.047
ROBIN:
<i>The chairman asks you...</i>

09:46.048 --> 09:47.891
Do you think The Arcadian
should be a landmark?

09:47.892 --> 09:49.372
<i>You say...</i>
Yes

09:49.384 --> 09:51.456
<i>And you're happy</i>
<i>for, like, a second,</i>

09:51.587 --> 09:53.755
until you realize the building
<i>you helped save</i>

09:53.756 --> 09:55.056
<i>has just become a monument</i>

09:55.057 --> 09:56.491
<i>to everything</i>
<i>this woman made you give up,</i>

09:56.492 --> 09:57.759
<i>and you resent her for it,</i>

09:57.760 --> 10:00.795
<i>so much so, in fact,</i>
<i>that</i> you <i>dump</i> her.

10:00.796 --> 10:01.996
We're done here.

10:01.997 --> 10:03.870
You said there was
a third scenario.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.033
Right.

10:05.034 --> 10:06.467
ROBIN:
<i>The chairman asks you...</i>

10:06.468 --> 10:08.903
Do you think The Arcadian
should be a landmark?

10:08.904 --> 10:10.988
<i>But before you can answer...</i>

10:10.989 --> 10:13.324
<i>You're hit in the neck with</i>
<i>a blow dart fired by the ninja</i>

10:13.325 --> 10:15.877
<i>Zoey's ex-husband hired</i>
<i>to assassinate you.</i>

10:19.148 --> 10:21.115
That one's less likely.

10:21.717 --> 10:23.818
What I'm saying...

10:23.819 --> 10:26.154
what I hate saying...

10:26.155 --> 10:28.656
is this.

10:28.657 --> 10:30.591
You and Zoey are gonna break up.

10:30.592 --> 10:33.027
But you can still
save your career

10:33.028 --> 10:34.362
and Barney's.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.731
Okay, first of all,

10:36.732 --> 10:38.533
no ninja's getting a jump on me.

10:38.534 --> 10:41.903
I have the reflexes
of a jungle...

10:41.904 --> 10:43.371
Tree?

10:44.807 --> 10:46.074
Second of all,

10:46.075 --> 10:48.176
I don't care that the odds
are stacked against us.

10:48.177 --> 10:50.311
I'd rather try
to make this work with Zoey

10:50.312 --> 10:53.414
than spend the rest of my life
alone playing Angry Birds,

10:53.415 --> 10:54.582
which, by the way, I've shown
you how to download,

10:54.583 --> 10:56.751
like, 20 times.
I've got to say,

10:56.752 --> 10:58.186
I'm with Ted on this.

10:58.187 --> 10:59.420
Thank you.
I mean, yes,

10:59.421 --> 11:01.739
this is a huge,
divisive issue for them.

11:01.740 --> 11:03.691
Which means
no matter what happens,

11:03.692 --> 11:05.927
there's gonna be
a lot of resentment.

11:05.928 --> 11:07.195
Probably lasting

11:07.196 --> 11:08.729
for years...

11:08.730 --> 11:13.101
infecting every single moment of
the rest of their relationship.

11:13.102 --> 11:16.003
So, in conclusion,
I'm with Robin on this.

11:16.004 --> 11:17.772
Thank you.

11:17.773 --> 11:19.340
NARRATOR:
<i>That night,</i>

11:19.341 --> 11:21.576

11:27.433 --> 11:29.150
(panting)

11:29.151 --> 11:31.285
Barney, what are you doing?

11:31.286 --> 11:33.454
Who is this Barney?

11:33.455 --> 11:35.740
My name is
John Clifford Larrabee,

11:35.741 --> 11:37.792
architect of The Arcadian.

11:37.793 --> 11:38.793
And I am

11:38.794 --> 11:40.027
visiting you

11:40.028 --> 11:42.730
(ghostly moaning):
in a dream...

11:42.731 --> 11:44.932
Really? 'Cause it feels
more like my insane friend

11:44.933 --> 11:47.201
renting a costume
and breaking into my apartment

11:47.202 --> 11:48.669
in the middle of the night

11:48.670 --> 11:51.372
for what I wish
I could say was the first time.

11:51.373 --> 11:52.874
Look, it's a dream, it is.

11:52.875 --> 11:55.076
So just... okay?

11:56.879 --> 11:58.546
Theodore...

11:58.547 --> 12:00.281
heed my words:

12:00.282 --> 12:03.885
do not try to save
The Arcadian.

12:03.886 --> 12:05.186
Barney, there's condoms
in the drawer.

12:05.187 --> 12:06.437
Just take them and get out.

12:06.438 --> 12:08.656
(shouting dramatically):
I am not

12:08.657 --> 12:09.941
(ghostly moaning):
Barney...

12:09.942 --> 12:12.960
Whoa! Lighting change!

12:12.961 --> 12:17.665
Theodore, you know The Arcadian
is a badly built,

12:17.666 --> 12:20.568
architecturally unimportant
rat's nest

12:20.569 --> 12:23.371
designed by an overpaid,
plagiarizing ether addict

12:23.372 --> 12:25.039
with two thumbs.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.008
This guy.

12:27.009 --> 12:29.443
Okay, yes,
it's-it's a terrible building,

12:29.444 --> 12:32.580
but... does that mean
we have to knock it down?

12:32.581 --> 12:34.749
I mean, it's
not bothering anyone.

12:34.750 --> 12:37.018
Just anyone who lives in it.

12:37.019 --> 12:38.920
Or looks at it.

12:38.921 --> 12:40.588
Or smells it.

12:40.589 --> 12:44.091
New York is never finished,
Theodore.

12:44.092 --> 12:45.560
She's a lady

12:45.561 --> 12:48.596
only a handful of architects
ever get to dance with.

12:48.597 --> 12:49.964
Do not miss

12:49.965 --> 12:51.933
your turn.

12:54.269 --> 12:56.871
The Arcadian has to go,
doesn't it?

12:56.872 --> 12:58.072
Indeed.

12:58.073 --> 13:01.609
You realize this kind of
screws up my personal life.

13:01.610 --> 13:04.111
Mo' buildings, mo' problems.

13:07.082 --> 13:09.116
This is a dream, right?

13:09.117 --> 13:11.752
Because, Barney, I swear to God,
if that's you...

13:11.753 --> 13:12.620
(groans softly)

13:12.621 --> 13:14.889
(snaps fingers)

13:16.091 --> 13:19.894
Mommy's got
Magic Lady Bits, Ted.

13:19.895 --> 13:22.563
(panting):
Dream! Dream!

13:22.564 --> 13:24.332
It was just a dream.

14:20.755 --> 14:22.923
Worth every penny.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.360

14:26.361 --> 14:27.812
this was fun.

No, we should get some sleep.

14:45.614 --> 14:47.748
But this was fun.

14:47.749 --> 14:49.116
Yeah.

14:49.117 --> 14:50.951
It's nice getting one last look

14:50.952 --> 14:52.987
to remember what
we're trying to save.

14:52.988 --> 14:56.324
Exactly.

<i>Should The Arcadian</i>

No, it shouldn't be a landmark.

15:12.074 --> 15:13.007
(audience gasps)

15:13.008 --> 15:14.041
There are a lot

15:14.042 --> 15:15.743
of important buildings
in New York.

15:15.744 --> 15:17.545
The Arcadian isn't one of them.

15:22.317 --> 15:23.351
E-Excuse me,

15:23.352 --> 15:24.985
I have a question for Mr. Mosby.

15:24.986 --> 15:26.370
If he doesn't think

15:26.371 --> 15:30.291
The Arcadian's worth saving,
then whose voice is this?

15:30.292 --> 15:32.893
TED (on recorder):
The Arcadian should be a landmark.

15:32.894 --> 15:34.328
It should.

15:34.329 --> 15:37.365
The lion head stonework
is iconic.

15:38.367 --> 15:39.600
I hate working for GNB.

15:39.601 --> 15:40.835

15:40.836 --> 15:42.837
wieners and gonads.

Oh, heavens!

15:44.873 --> 15:46.574
My stars!

15:46.575 --> 15:48.476
Is that your voice, Mr. Mosby?

15:53.181 --> 15:55.483
Yeah, that's me.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.391
This is a nightmare.
I can't believe

16:00.422 --> 16:01.455
she kept that tape.

16:01.456 --> 16:02.423
The LPC's gonna

16:02.424 --> 16:04.091

16:05.360 --> 16:07.127

16:07.128 --> 16:09.463
Yeah. We'll end up
out of a job,

16:09.464 --> 16:14.068
all thanks to some stupid,
only sort of awesome lion head.

16:14.069 --> 16:15.870
Better get used

As of tomorrow, it's gonna be
there till the end of times.

16:19.808 --> 16:22.643
And all because
of my sweet, sweet rhymes.

16:24.146 --> 16:26.414
What are we gonna do?

16:28.717 --> 16:31.986
We should buy a bar.
BARNEY: We should totally buy a bar!

16:31.987 --> 16:33.654
We should absolutely
totally buy a bar!

16:33.655 --> 16:35.323
It's really the only
sensible idea right now.

16:35.324 --> 16:36.624
MARSHALL:
Oh, oh, and ready?

16:36.625 --> 16:37.992
It's a theme bar.

16:37.993 --> 16:39.026
TED:
Mm!

16:39.027 --> 16:40.061
It's a courtroom.

16:40.062 --> 16:42.113
Yes!
Ah!

16:42.114 --> 16:45.299
Where the bartenders
wear sexy judges' robes.

16:45.300 --> 16:46.934
I'll allow it!

16:46.935 --> 16:49.337

show up, <i>then</i> get served.

16:49.338 --> 16:50.337
Ho!

16:50.338 --> 16:52.607
You're judged by a jury
of your beers.

16:52.608 --> 16:53.524
That's not bad.

16:53.525 --> 16:54.542
Just stop it!

16:54.543 --> 16:55.610
No one's buying a bar.

16:55.611 --> 16:57.195
Right now we have
a little problem.

16:57.196 --> 16:59.013
Let's just think
of a solution.

16:59.014 --> 17:00.982
Lily, it's over.

17:00.983 --> 17:02.650
The good guys lost.

17:02.651 --> 17:05.319
I don't know, homegirl
is pretty diabolical.

17:05.319 --> 17:08.388
If there is a plan
that'll get us out of this,

17:08.390 --> 17:11.492
it's somewhere
inside this butter churn.

17:11.492 --> 17:13.627
She'll think of it.

17:13.628 --> 17:16.430
I'm just gonna sit here...

17:16.431 --> 17:18.382
and watch it happen.

17:20.769 --> 17:22.470
And she's got it!

17:22.471 --> 17:24.055
Lily, what's the plan?

17:24.056 --> 17:26.707
(groans)
Oh, this ought to be good.

17:26.708 --> 17:28.843
And then Lily told us her plan.

17:28.844 --> 17:31.846
Oh, this is <i>good!</i>

17:31.847 --> 17:33.781
We have to find
Arthur right now.

17:33.782 --> 17:35.516
(shudders)

17:36.268 --> 17:38.352
What is so difficult
about this?!

17:38.353 --> 17:40.054
Tugboat figured this out
in, like, five minutes.

17:40.055 --> 17:41.789
This is bush league!

17:41.790 --> 17:43.057
BARNEY:
Hey, Arthur!

17:43.058 --> 17:45.059
Oh, cute dog!

17:45.060 --> 17:47.862
No! Tugboat, my other dog,
that was a cute dog.

17:47.863 --> 17:51.365
This little <i>disappointment</i> is
nothing but a cheap facsimile.

17:51.366 --> 17:52.633
I said it!

17:52.634 --> 17:54.235
Yeah, my love is
reserved for dogs

17:54.236 --> 17:56.103
that go to the bathroom
on command

17:56.104 --> 17:58.105
instead of wasting my time!

17:58.106 --> 18:00.942
BARNEY:
Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife

18:00.943 --> 18:04.779
has an idea for how we can
save <i>not saving</i> The Arcadian.

18:04.780 --> 18:06.130
Oh, his wife has an idea.

18:06.131 --> 18:07.715
Let me tell you
about wives, okay?

18:07.716 --> 18:10.134
They leave you and take
your best friend with them.

18:10.135 --> 18:11.385
You're not Tugboat!

18:11.386 --> 18:13.955
You'll never be Tugboat!

18:15.023 --> 18:18.059
(stammers, pants):
Uh...

18:18.060 --> 18:19.426
Hey, Arthur?

18:27.035 --> 18:30.621
I guess this one's
kind of cute or whatever.

18:31.673 --> 18:34.575
So... so what's the idea?

18:34.576 --> 18:37.545
Okay, first hear
my demands. One,

18:37.546 --> 18:39.947
Ted and Barney
keep their jobs.

18:39.948 --> 18:42.650
Two, when you guys do finally
blow up The Arcadian,

18:42.651 --> 18:44.752
one of them gets
to push the button.

18:44.753 --> 18:46.754
Dibs.
Dibs.

18:46.755 --> 18:48.673
Fine! What's the idea?

18:48.674 --> 18:50.524
Well...
<i>Kids, for legal reasons,</i>

18:50.525 --> 18:52.560
<i>I have to skip</i>
<i>this part of the story</i>

18:52.561 --> 18:54.295
<i>and jump ahead</i>
<i>to the next night,</i>

18:54.296 --> 18:55.796
<i>as the Landmarks</i>
<i>Preservation Commission</i>

18:55.797 --> 18:57.031
<i>gave their verdict.</i>

18:57.032 --> 18:58.032
Last night,

18:58.033 --> 18:59.700
this committee took a vote,

18:59.701 --> 19:03.337
and while we have all felt
from the very beginning that

19:03.338 --> 19:04.705
The Arcadian is,

19:04.706 --> 19:07.341
(chuckles):
well, an eyesore...

19:07.342 --> 19:10.544
Mr. Mosby's surprising testimony

19:10.545 --> 19:12.613
<i>about the lion's head</i>
<i>stonework</i>

19:12.614 --> 19:15.549
<i>left us no choice</i>
<i>but to declare it...</i>

19:15.550 --> 19:17.284
a landmark.

19:18.887 --> 19:20.955
(gavel pounding)

19:20.956 --> 19:24.759
But then, something else
happened last night.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.794
<i>That same lion's head</i>

19:26.795 --> 19:27.995
stonework...

19:27.996 --> 19:30.898
(electric tool whirring)

19:30.899 --> 19:31.866
...disappeared.

19:31.867 --> 19:34.435
(audience gasps)
So...

19:34.436 --> 19:37.138
that makes our job
a little easier.

19:37.139 --> 19:38.839
Motion denied.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.107
(gavel pounds)

19:40.108 --> 19:43.711
(preservationists groan,
GNB people applaud and cheer)

19:48.583 --> 19:49.617
Zoey...

19:49.618 --> 19:50.851
Zoey!

19:51.870 --> 19:54.622
All right, what do you have
to say for yourself?

19:54.623 --> 19:56.223
(sighs)

19:56.224 --> 19:57.625
I don't know.

19:57.626 --> 20:01.062
Sometimes... things
have to fall apart

20:01.063 --> 20:04.265
to make way for better things.

20:13.575 --> 20:14.909
We're done here.

20:14.910 --> 20:18.610
