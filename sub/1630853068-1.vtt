WEBVTT

00:14.482 --> 00:16.586
From time immemorial,

00:16.620 --> 00:19.896
we humans have looked up
at the night sky,

00:19.931 --> 00:23.000
marveling at billions
of tiny specks.

00:26.758 --> 00:30.310
Settling on distant planets
was once the domain

00:30.344 --> 00:32.206
of poets and dreamers.

00:33.793 --> 00:36.448
But with every leap
in technology,

00:36.482 --> 00:39.344
we come closer
to realizing their dreams.

00:44.655 --> 00:48.068
Today, techies
and entrepreneurs

00:48.103 --> 00:50.862
plan to colonize
faraway planets.

00:53.068 --> 00:56.758
The first step on this journey
to conquer the galaxy,

00:56.793 --> 00:59.137
will be our own solar system.

01:03.689 --> 01:07.482
Incredibly, scientists
are even working on voyages

01:07.517 --> 01:10.103
to planets around other stars.

01:14.620 --> 01:17.655
They see us as
an interstellar species,

01:17.689 --> 01:19.827
that will spread
across the cosmos.

01:23.724 --> 01:27.310
So have we humans
outgrown our little planet?

01:27.344 --> 01:31.344
Or do we need to seek
our destiny among the stars?

02:04.689 --> 02:07.034
We're off on
a sweeping quest

02:07.068 --> 02:09.827
to discover
the cutting-edge projects

02:09.862 --> 02:12.551
driving today's
space revolution.

02:14.103 --> 02:18.862
On our voyage, we will learn
that the most ambitious ideas

02:18.896 --> 02:21.862
are sometimes found
in the remotest places.

02:25.965 --> 02:29.724
Our travels begin in
Coeur d'Alene, Idaho,

02:29.758 --> 02:33.034
where America's disaster
preppers go off-grid.

02:36.448 --> 02:41.724
We want to meet the world's
most fervent prophet
of space colonization.

02:43.034 --> 02:46.724
Leading futurologist
Marshall Savage

02:46.758 --> 02:50.758
penned Colonizing The Galaxy
in Eight Easy Steps.

02:52.206 --> 02:55.689
He's mapped out
humanity's exit from Earth.

02:57.551 --> 03:01.448
This is an instinctive urge
of our species

03:01.482 --> 03:03.310
to migrate into space.

03:03.344 --> 03:06.137
The way salmon
return upstream.

03:06.172 --> 03:07.965
You know, this is something
we're going to do,

03:08.000 --> 03:13.206
and you can see people
like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk
are actually doing it,

03:13.241 --> 03:16.620
and they're an expression of
that urge of the human race

03:16.655 --> 03:19.655
to spread itself, ultimately,
among the stars.

03:19.689 --> 03:22.172
And if we survive,
that will happen.

03:22.206 --> 03:24.931
and if it doesn't happen,
we probably won't survive.

03:32.482 --> 03:36.551
I've lived out west
all my life, and we've always
had forest fires.

03:36.586 --> 03:38.137
But never anything like this.

03:39.379 --> 03:42.586
Whole towns are being
burned to the ground.

03:46.206 --> 03:49.448
And it makes you wonder
what is next year

03:49.482 --> 03:51.551
and the year after
going to be like.

04:01.344 --> 04:06.344
Marshall Savage
has observed that our climate
is at a tipping point.

04:11.448 --> 04:13.931
There is a catastrophe
in the making.

04:16.931 --> 04:19.448
We've already
advanced too far,

04:19.482 --> 04:23.000
in terms of changing
the underlying climate
to prevent it.

04:25.724 --> 04:30.655
Marshall fears
that our planet may soon
become uninhabitable.

04:33.275 --> 04:35.620
I can't tell you when
it's going to happen.

04:35.655 --> 04:39.000
But we should go as soon
as we're capable of going.

04:43.620 --> 04:47.965
In Copenhagen,
Anna Olsen has heard the call
to go to space.

04:49.620 --> 04:52.068
It might be an unlikely place.

04:52.103 --> 04:55.896
But a harbor warehouse
is where the biology student

04:55.931 --> 04:59.206
wants to take on
an immense challenge.

05:07.758 --> 05:10.655
She's determined
to be the first astronaut

05:10.689 --> 05:13.655
of a group of
weekend rocketeers...

05:13.689 --> 05:17.137
The Copenhagen Suborbitals.

05:17.172 --> 05:23.137
As motley as this crew
of students, electricians
and engineers may seem,

05:23.172 --> 05:27.137
their technology
is highly sophisticated.

05:27.172 --> 05:30.586
Anna and her team want
to go down in history

05:30.620 --> 05:35.413
as the first amateur group to
complete a human spaceflight.

05:35.448 --> 05:36.862
Before going
into space,

05:36.896 --> 05:40.586
I think I will need to prepare
by exercising,

05:40.620 --> 05:43.827
because you are exposed
to a lot of G-forces.

05:43.862 --> 05:48.482
So you have to be
some kind of physically fit.

05:51.793 --> 05:54.724
I think it will be a quite an
unpleasant journey up there,

05:54.758 --> 05:57.275
but once you reach
zero gravity,

05:57.310 --> 05:59.689
I think it'll be amazing.

06:01.655 --> 06:08.413
Meanwhile,
Anna's father, Carsten Olsen,
is another astronaut hopeful.

06:08.448 --> 06:10.551
I actually
love space flights.

06:10.586 --> 06:13.103
I love the idea of going
to another planet.

06:13.137 --> 06:14.344
It's a great adventure.

06:14.379 --> 06:16.862
It's like dreaming
about new worlds,

06:16.896 --> 06:19.551
and I have a huge dream
in my life.

06:19.586 --> 06:21.241
Looking at the moon
from space,

06:21.275 --> 06:22.724
that would be...

06:23.965 --> 06:25.551
Really, really beautiful,
I think.

06:29.413 --> 06:32.344
Financed entirely
by donations,

06:32.379 --> 06:36.655
the Suborbitals are already
launching self-built rockets,

06:36.689 --> 06:40.034
from this platform
in the Baltic Sea.

06:40.068 --> 06:44.689
The Danish Coast Guard closes
the area for boat traffic,

06:44.724 --> 06:49.379
when the scaled-down rockets
hurtle thousands of feet
into the sky.

06:57.172 --> 06:59.793
Encouraged by their successes,

06:59.827 --> 07:04.413
the Suborbitals are now
building a full-sized rocket.

07:04.448 --> 07:07.482
Anna is personally
seeing to the details.

07:09.206 --> 07:13.034
I am painting the tanks
for the Spica rocket,

07:13.068 --> 07:16.482
which is the rocket that will
hopefully go into space.

07:16.517 --> 07:19.448
And it is one meter
in diameter

07:19.482 --> 07:23.275
which is also the space
that I will be sitting in.

07:23.310 --> 07:27.724
So I will be sitting in
a cannonball position,

07:27.758 --> 07:30.379
with my knees up to my ears.

07:30.413 --> 07:32.137
So, that's not a lot of space.

07:38.620 --> 07:41.517
Unfortunately,
cramped conditions

07:41.551 --> 07:45.344
aren't the only danger
DIY astronauts might face.

07:50.862 --> 07:52.827
And we have splashdown.

07:55.344 --> 07:59.413
Some of
the unmanned tests
didn't turn out well,

07:59.448 --> 08:03.793
with engines failing
and tanks running out of fuel.

08:03.827 --> 08:08.241
And that's why
before Anna and Carsten
lift off to the stars,

08:08.275 --> 08:13.034
this gentleman will
have to complete some
successful flights.

08:13.068 --> 08:16.310
This is Rescue Randy,
our crash test dummy.

08:16.344 --> 08:18.620
He is our first
flight astronaut.

08:18.655 --> 08:21.517
He has been flying
several times in our capsules.

08:21.551 --> 08:24.551
And not each flight
has been very good.

08:26.034 --> 08:28.482
Once he flew in
one of the capsules

08:28.517 --> 08:32.068
where the parachute
didn't fall out as it was
supposed to.

08:34.758 --> 08:37.137
And he lost his leg
during that.

08:37.172 --> 08:39.758
Our doctor of medicine,
he told us

08:39.793 --> 08:43.379
that he would have
survived, but...

08:43.413 --> 08:45.793
He wouldn't be in
a very good condition.

08:45.827 --> 08:48.310
But you can still be a good
astronaut without a leg.

08:53.862 --> 08:56.448
Undaunted
by such incidents,

08:56.482 --> 08:59.724
we found Anna lost
in her own universe.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.413
I dream of
going to space.

09:11.448 --> 09:13.965
And just floating around
in zero gravity.

09:20.241 --> 09:24.068
I would love to experience
the silence on another planet.

09:24.103 --> 09:25.172
For instance, on Mars.

09:25.931 --> 09:29.310
And just see how red it is.

09:29.344 --> 09:34.241
And experiencing
the totally uncolonized
planet.

09:44.586 --> 09:47.758
Anna and Carsten
are ready for takeoff.

09:47.793 --> 09:50.551
And they are not
the only enthusiasts

09:50.586 --> 09:53.241
looking forward
to the conquest of space.

10:04.517 --> 10:06.482
There is a race going on,

10:06.517 --> 10:10.068
faster and more ambitious
than ever before.

10:14.793 --> 10:18.931
Billionaire entrepreneurs
are venturing out into space

10:18.965 --> 10:21.586
in a testosterone-fueled
competition.

10:24.965 --> 10:28.034
With the survival
of humankind at stake,

10:28.068 --> 10:31.517
they're pushing
for the colonization
of our galaxy.

10:33.689 --> 10:37.034
What is your vision
for the future
of space exploration?

10:37.068 --> 10:41.137
What we wanna see is
millions of people living
and working in space.

10:41.172 --> 10:42.551
Space is a...

10:43.206 --> 10:44.275
Is an adventure.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.448
It has limitless
resources that--

10:46.482 --> 10:49.689
You know, we're finding
that the Earth is a very
finite place.

10:49.724 --> 10:51.896
And we humans need
to go into space

10:51.931 --> 10:54.517
if we're to continue
to evolve our civilization.

10:56.310 --> 11:01.620
We have
to drive innovation hard
to make life multi-planetary.

11:01.655 --> 11:05.965
I think this is very important
to secure the future of life
as we know it,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.758
to ensure that the light of
consciousness does not go out.

11:12.034 --> 11:15.482
Landers and
starships are being built.

11:15.517 --> 11:19.034
Not only to take astronauts
to other planets,

11:19.068 --> 11:22.931
but to transport hundreds
of thousands of settlers

11:22.965 --> 11:28.586
to inhabit vast
space cities imagined
by Elon Musk and others.

11:51.517 --> 11:57.241
But what does colonizing
the dark desolation of space
really mean?

12:00.448 --> 12:06.379
In Creede, Colorado,
we seek out a man who can
shed light on the matter.

12:09.827 --> 12:14.448
Mike Foale spent more
than a year away
from our home planet.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.206
For him, it was an
eye-opening experience.

12:21.137 --> 12:22.655
When you think
about what's out there,

12:22.689 --> 12:25.034
and what we're a part of
in terms of being the speck.

12:25.068 --> 12:27.655
The speck

12:27.689 --> 12:29.275
in this universe.

12:29.310 --> 12:31.482
It's... It's pretty cosmic.

12:31.517 --> 12:33.655
It's a mind-altering
experience.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.310
It's very exciting.

12:38.517 --> 12:43.206
Mike Foale
was once a commander
of our lone outpost in space.

12:44.896 --> 12:46.793
The International
Space Station is one of

12:46.827 --> 12:48.758
mankind's greatest
achievements.

12:49.931 --> 12:52.413
It's something equivalent,
I think, to the pyramids.

12:52.448 --> 12:54.827
It's one of those great
wonders of the world.

12:54.862 --> 12:58.620
And that contribution,
I think, to you know,
to human posterity

12:58.655 --> 13:00.965
is the beginning of
settlements in space.

13:04.448 --> 13:07.896
But venturing out
like this comes at a price...

13:09.862 --> 13:15.586
Mike Foale is a survivor
of a collision on the Russian
space station, Mir,

13:15.620 --> 13:18.413
one of the worst accidents
in space history.

13:21.379 --> 13:23.896
He knows from
personal experience

13:23.931 --> 13:27.448
what navigating outer space
really means.

13:29.586 --> 13:31.241
Space is
a hard environment.

13:31.275 --> 13:35.517
A vacuum at a temperature
on average ranging from

13:35.551 --> 13:39.862
minus 200 Celsius all the way
up to plus 200 Celsius.

13:39.896 --> 13:42.793
That's a huge variation
of temperature.

13:42.827 --> 13:44.551
And, of course,
there's no air.

13:44.586 --> 13:47.137
And if you go near
a window that doesn't have
ultraviolet protection,

13:47.172 --> 13:49.965
you get burned,
sunburned in 30 seconds.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.758
And you'll also, occasionally,
look out at your spacecraft,

13:52.793 --> 13:54.586
and you'll see holes in--

13:54.620 --> 13:58.000
In the solar arrays, and
you go, "Oh, wow!

13:58.034 --> 13:59.206
That was a rock
that went through."

14:06.689 --> 14:08.344
If things go wrong
in your spacecraft,

14:08.379 --> 14:10.068
of course you're on
a knife's edge there.

14:10.103 --> 14:12.137
All of your life support
systems have to work.

14:13.206 --> 14:14.517
Your oxygen
has to be produced.

14:14.551 --> 14:16.965
Your carbon dioxide
has to be scrubbed.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.758
Your water has
to be supplied and your food
needs to be present.

14:20.965 --> 14:22.655
So, that's the hard
part of space.

14:27.310 --> 14:31.862
Despite all this,
Mike Foale remains unfazed.

14:33.931 --> 14:36.172
And there are
a number of humans like me,

14:36.206 --> 14:39.344
men and women, who are
driven by the same motivations
that I have.

14:40.862 --> 14:46.034
So, they will suffer well
the difficulties,
the challenges, the deaths,

14:46.068 --> 14:48.896
the disease,
all of the problems

14:48.931 --> 14:53.172
of exploring and going
beyond the Earth
to settle in space.

14:55.379 --> 15:00.793
But it won't be
99.99% of humanity,
it'll be a tiny fraction.

15:00.827 --> 15:03.758
With that just 100 or 1,000
out in space,

15:03.793 --> 15:07.620
then humans will survive
the asteroid impact
that's bound to happen.

15:07.655 --> 15:11.413
Or the ecological disasters
that are bound to, you know,
bound to happen.

15:11.448 --> 15:13.655
Humanity as it...

15:13.689 --> 15:15.827
Not as it is today,
but as it will evolve,

15:15.862 --> 15:18.068
will continue
beyond the Earth.

15:29.931 --> 15:33.000
There will always
be people like Mike Foale

15:33.034 --> 15:35.827
who want to venture
out into the unknown,

15:35.862 --> 15:39.000
no matter how hazardous
it might be.

15:39.793 --> 15:42.655
It's the human
pioneering spirit

15:42.689 --> 15:45.689
that will drive us
into the solar system.

15:56.206 --> 16:02.448
To find out what
a space colony might look like
we've come to the Ramon Crater

16:02.482 --> 16:07.172
some 120 miles
south of Jerusalem
in the Negev Desert.

16:11.551 --> 16:17.724
There are few places on Earth
that are as geologically
similar to Mars.

16:18.482 --> 16:19.862
And that's the reason why

16:19.896 --> 16:24.275
a precious cargo
is being transported
to this remote region.

16:44.103 --> 16:49.724
Whoa, look at that.
Welcome to the desert.

16:50.517 --> 16:52.137
Welcome to Mars.

17:02.206 --> 17:03.413
That is the helmet

17:03.448 --> 17:06.482
of the experimental
spacesuit simulator, Aouda.X.

17:06.517 --> 17:08.482
We've been working
for more than ten years

17:08.517 --> 17:10.241
on this spacecraft
that we're in.

17:10.275 --> 17:12.275
It's able to mimic
all the major limitations

17:12.310 --> 17:13.827
in actual space it would have,

17:13.862 --> 17:17.862
so seeing this here
means we're almost good to go.

17:20.379 --> 17:23.172
Astrophysicist
Gernot Gromer,

17:23.206 --> 17:27.379
is the director of
the Austrian Space Forum.

17:27.413 --> 17:32.724
His organization is simulating
a possible colony on Mars.

17:32.758 --> 17:37.793
NASA and the European Space
Agency are also involved,

17:37.827 --> 17:42.206
making it the most
elaborate project
of its kind in the world.

17:43.482 --> 17:47.793
Today they are testing
a state-of-the-art spacesuit

17:47.827 --> 17:50.724
with sensors
and bio-feedback systems.

18:02.448 --> 18:08.000
Ultimately,
after 30,000 generations
of Homo sapiensas a species,

18:08.034 --> 18:12.448
we are one of the first ones
who have the technological
means to do that journey.

18:13.413 --> 18:16.275
We are, I think,
a migratory species.

18:16.310 --> 18:18.172
And I believe there will be
cities on Mars,

18:18.206 --> 18:20.034
for sure,
it's just a matter of time.

18:20.068 --> 18:23.482
It will be a statement
to the universe,
we are out there.

18:27.275 --> 18:29.724
This might be
the first glimpse

18:29.758 --> 18:32.103
of our future
as space colonists.

18:39.275 --> 18:44.862
But what challenges
will we have to overcome
to realize this dream?

18:53.827 --> 18:59.172
There is a man who is
more acquainted than most
with the challenges of Mars.

19:00.482 --> 19:04.344
Doug Hofmann works for
NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab,

19:04.379 --> 19:07.758
which has sent several rovers
to the red planet.

19:10.655 --> 19:14.620
He knows all about conditions
on this alien world.

19:18.517 --> 19:21.448
So, we have several
landers and rovers

19:21.482 --> 19:22.896
on the surface of Mars,

19:22.931 --> 19:26.275
and honestly,
for human habitation,

19:26.310 --> 19:29.068
Mars is pretty inhospitable.

19:29.103 --> 19:31.103
So, it's cold for starters.

19:31.137 --> 19:34.241
We also have, you know,
virtually no atmosphere,

19:34.275 --> 19:36.241
which contributes to it
being cold.

19:36.275 --> 19:39.068
And of course we don't see
any living things

19:39.103 --> 19:41.689
on the surface of Mars
due to those harsh conditions.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.793
Even getting there
would be fraught with danger.

19:48.827 --> 19:52.275
Astronauts would travel
outside the protection

19:52.310 --> 19:57.655
of the Earth's magnetic field
and atmosphere that shield us
from radiation.

20:02.586 --> 20:07.206
Solar eruptions randomly fling
charged particles into space.

20:08.517 --> 20:13.068
Such a solar storm
could wipe out a crew
headed for Mars.

20:15.965 --> 20:19.344
If you're traveling
between Earth and Mars,
out in deep space,

20:19.379 --> 20:22.172
and there's a significant
solar event,

20:22.206 --> 20:26.379
that can create sort of an
enormous amount of radiation

20:26.413 --> 20:29.000
which would be very hard
to shield against and would be

20:29.034 --> 20:31.448
potentially life-threatening
to a crew.

20:34.034 --> 20:37.655
On top of that,
astronauts would
have to endure

20:37.689 --> 20:41.068
a bombardment
of galactic cosmic radiation.

20:45.724 --> 20:48.379
These are
very high-energy particles,

20:48.413 --> 20:52.965
and so you really need,
you know, maybe 10 meters
or more

20:53.000 --> 20:57.310
of liquid water
or liquid hydrogen
to protect you.

20:57.344 --> 20:59.896
So, essentially the way
I like to think about this is,

20:59.931 --> 21:02.758
you're essentially
putting your spacecraft
into a fish tank.

21:02.793 --> 21:05.689
You've got a big fish tank
and you're the goldfish
sitting in the middle.

21:07.655 --> 21:14.827
Once astronauts have
arrived on the surface of Mars
their troubles won't end.

21:14.862 --> 21:18.551
Radiation is more than
12 times that of Earth,

21:18.586 --> 21:21.241
not counting
deadly solar storms.

21:25.068 --> 21:28.862
The reality of a life on Mars
would be sobering.

21:32.068 --> 21:38.103
A crew of hardy astronauts
would hunker down
in radiation-proof bunkers,

21:38.137 --> 21:41.655
enjoying drinks
of recycled urine.

21:43.827 --> 21:47.965
While cities on Mars
seem fantastical,

21:48.000 --> 21:51.482
this kind of rugged outpost
could be within our reach.

21:57.965 --> 22:00.965
There is someone
who thinks it's possible.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.034
But if they ask you
to be a Mars settler,
you had better flee.

22:15.793 --> 22:18.931
Space anthropologist,
Taylor Genovese

22:18.965 --> 22:22.310
asked to meet us
in an abandoned missile site,

22:22.344 --> 22:25.758
the most depressing place
he could find.

22:29.172 --> 22:33.241
The reality of going
to another planet

22:33.275 --> 22:37.827
in our current environment,
I think is probably most...

22:37.862 --> 22:41.310
The best analogy is
an Amazon fulfillment center.

22:41.344 --> 22:44.517
You won't be able
to actually see where you are.

22:44.551 --> 22:47.172
You're gonna be
inside of a factory.

22:47.206 --> 22:49.758
And you're not
going to experience

22:49.793 --> 22:51.620
what you think you're
going to be experiencing.

22:51.655 --> 22:54.827
That is, the kind of awe
of being on another planet,

22:54.862 --> 22:58.793
and experiencing
being off of Earth.

22:58.827 --> 23:01.000
No, you're gonna be working
inside of a cubicle.

23:02.931 --> 23:05.275
Despite this
grim outlook,

23:05.310 --> 23:08.965
corporate businessmen have
intensified their mission,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.172
forging ahead
with private space programs.

23:14.241 --> 23:20.241
The privatization
of space flight has become
the norm now.

23:20.275 --> 23:24.034
You know, Blue Origin
is an offshoot of Amazon.

23:24.068 --> 23:28.413
And we have Virgin Galactic
as an offshoot of the Virgin
conglomerate.

23:28.448 --> 23:33.172
So, instead of pushing
into space to explore,

23:33.206 --> 23:37.862
now we're seeing
space corporations
wanting to go into space

23:37.896 --> 23:40.689
solely to exploit
the resources that are there,

23:40.724 --> 23:42.827
wanting to push
people into space,

23:42.862 --> 23:47.517
so that they have a workforce
to control and maintain

23:47.551 --> 23:53.034
their corporate
executives' vision
of what space needs to be.

23:58.172 --> 24:01.241
Taylor is concerned
about the implications

24:01.275 --> 24:03.689
of commercial settlements
on Mars.

24:05.965 --> 24:08.137
Let's say we have
a community on Mars.

24:08.172 --> 24:11.172
Musk Town, we'll call it,
is on Mars.

24:11.206 --> 24:17.137
And Elon's back on Earth
because he knows that
it's better to be on a planet

24:17.172 --> 24:19.517
you can breathe on,
and kind of direct

24:19.551 --> 24:21.586
the people
that are in Musk Town.

24:21.620 --> 24:23.862
Let's say they're mining
rare Earth minerals.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.689
Something that would be
quite valuable.

24:25.724 --> 24:28.586
And they're starting
to get fed up with

24:28.620 --> 24:31.413
the 12-hour work shifts
or whatever.

24:31.448 --> 24:35.137
The problem that we face
with a private corporation
in that instance

24:35.172 --> 24:39.724
is that they're
in sole control
of that settlement.

24:39.758 --> 24:44.551
What's stopping Papa Elon
from turning off the oxygen?

24:45.482 --> 24:48.724
Or from restricting
food shipments

24:48.758 --> 24:51.068
or restricting
water shipments?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.758
The reason
I'm so cynical about this,

24:56.793 --> 24:59.241
and why I'm talking about
that specifically,

24:59.275 --> 25:03.517
is we're seeing similar
tactics used today in,

25:03.551 --> 25:05.827
for example,
Amazon fulfillment centers.

25:05.862 --> 25:08.241
These same tactics
are being used

25:08.275 --> 25:11.724
in order to quash
justifiable worker grievances.

25:12.965 --> 25:14.310
The difference,
of course, is that

25:14.344 --> 25:16.862
they're here on Earth,
and they can go home.

25:16.896 --> 25:18.862
On Mars, you can't do that.

25:18.896 --> 25:22.724
And with a little bit of...

25:23.689 --> 25:27.344
you know, turning the screws
by Elon Musk,

25:27.379 --> 25:34.172
he can essentially turn
his free-market paradise
into a feudal slavery system.

25:42.448 --> 25:45.620
In space terms,
Mars may be close.

25:45.655 --> 25:47.689
But it's fraught
with challenges.

25:54.758 --> 25:57.172
Perhaps it would be
more promising

25:57.206 --> 26:03.068
to look for
a more hospitable place
beyond our solar system.

26:03.103 --> 26:07.896
There might be stars
out there orbited
by planets like our own.

26:15.758 --> 26:19.379
We travel to Mauna Kea,
a volcano in Hawaii,

26:19.413 --> 26:22.034
site of cutting-edge
telescopes.

26:24.241 --> 26:27.965
Its dizzying altitude
and pitch-dark nights

26:28.000 --> 26:31.172
have made it the mecca
of stargazers.

26:34.241 --> 26:37.379
We meet a former
advisory board member

26:37.413 --> 26:40.379
of Mauna Kea's
Gemini telescope,

26:40.413 --> 26:43.896
renowned astronomer,
Lucianne Walkowicz.

26:43.931 --> 26:48.862
Lucianne is one of the world's
foremost planet hunters.

26:48.896 --> 26:51.655
We look for things that are
maybe the size of Earth.

26:51.689 --> 26:55.137
So, places that could have
these nice, rocky surfaces

26:55.172 --> 26:57.448
that, you know,
have oceans on them.

26:57.482 --> 27:00.689
We look for places that
are the right temperature,

27:00.724 --> 27:02.827
not too hot, not too cold.

27:02.862 --> 27:06.241
We often compare it to
the fairy tale of Goldilocks

27:06.275 --> 27:09.448
and her porridge, right?
Not too hot, not too cold.

27:09.482 --> 27:12.620
And that's 'cause we want
the water to exist
in liquid form.

27:12.655 --> 27:14.310
And that's because
liquid water

27:14.344 --> 27:17.896
is one of the best solutions
for the chemistry of life.

27:20.724 --> 27:23.137
And then we look for
the atmosphere,

27:23.172 --> 27:25.965
and whether the atmosphere
would be likely to have

27:26.000 --> 27:32.137
things like oxygen,
or a balance of different
kinds of atmospheric gases

27:32.172 --> 27:34.344
that would be conducive
to life surviving.

27:41.758 --> 27:44.448
Until the late 2000s,

27:44.482 --> 27:49.931
only a few planets
outside our solar system
had been discovered.

27:52.517 --> 27:56.068
And nobody knew
whether any were like Earth.

28:00.310 --> 28:02.586
But then, everything changed.

28:04.620 --> 28:06.965
One of the most
transformative things

28:07.000 --> 28:09.793
for the discovery of planets
around other stars

28:09.827 --> 28:13.206
was really the Kepler mission,
which launched in 2009.

28:13.241 --> 28:17.206
And I had the great fortune
to be part of the Kepler
science team.

28:17.241 --> 28:20.517
I joined just before launch,
so I got to be present

28:20.551 --> 28:26.551
and experience this
nerve-wracking experience
of seeing your future career

28:26.586 --> 28:29.068
be put on top of
an exploding rocket

28:29.103 --> 28:31.103
that is going to
hurtle it into space.

28:40.241 --> 28:43.344
Lift-off for
the Delta II rocket
with Kepler,

28:43.379 --> 28:46.655
on a search for planets
in some way like our own.

28:47.896 --> 28:50.793
The launch
of the Kepler space telescope

28:50.827 --> 28:55.275
might just be remembered
as the beginning
of the biggest discovery

28:55.310 --> 28:58.896
in astronomy in our lifetime,

28:58.931 --> 29:04.931
peering further into space
than any optical telescope
on Earth.

29:04.965 --> 29:08.206
Kepler began its search
for faraway worlds.

29:12.586 --> 29:16.206
And it was really Kepler
that opened its eye,

29:16.241 --> 29:18.827
and then suddenly
started to find

29:18.862 --> 29:23.413
world after world,
these thousands of planets
that we never knew existed,

29:23.448 --> 29:27.448
and that imply the existence
of billions of planets more.

29:27.482 --> 29:29.655
So it really,
really changed
the game

29:29.689 --> 29:32.275
and really opened up
the universe to us.

29:42.310 --> 29:46.206
Kepler discovered
that many of these
countless exoplanets

29:46.241 --> 29:48.482
looked strangely familiar.

29:50.413 --> 29:53.172
Nobody could
tell you whether there
were other planets

29:53.206 --> 29:56.448
that were even potentially
like Earth out there.

29:56.482 --> 30:03.275
And now, it seems that that
is probably the most common
kind of planet that there is.

30:03.310 --> 30:06.482
And we still don't know
whether those planets
are really like Earth,

30:06.517 --> 30:09.448
in the sense that we mean it,
where we can walk around

30:09.482 --> 30:12.206
and enjoy the sunshine
and the breeze

30:12.241 --> 30:13.517
and the wind in our face.

30:13.551 --> 30:15.068
But it does mean that

30:15.103 --> 30:16.965
there are a lot of places
to look for life.

30:22.620 --> 30:28.793
Most exciting of all,
exoplanets have been detected
in our neighboring system,

30:28.827 --> 30:30.655
Alpha Centauri.

30:34.896 --> 30:40.965
One of them,
Proxima Centauri b,
is 4.2 light-years away.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.379
In the vastness
of the universe,
that's almost next-door.

30:49.482 --> 30:53.448
But even if this exoplanet
turned out to be habitable,

30:53.482 --> 30:56.482
a flight there
would take 5,000 years.

31:02.551 --> 31:04.275
I think
one of the challenges

31:04.310 --> 31:07.965
with the ideas that are
out there for traveling
through space,

31:08.000 --> 31:09.862
these huge distances that,
you know,

31:09.896 --> 31:12.034
we don't have
great solutions for

31:12.068 --> 31:14.827
human beings travelling
within their own lifetime

31:14.862 --> 31:18.206
to even the closest
neighboring planetary systems.

31:18.241 --> 31:21.103
So, there are these ideas
that you could put people

31:21.137 --> 31:23.103
on what we call
generation ships,

31:23.137 --> 31:25.068
where many generations
of people

31:25.103 --> 31:29.275
would live on those ships,
and then perhaps not you,
but your descendants,

31:29.310 --> 31:30.896
or your descendants'
descendants,

31:30.931 --> 31:33.000
would one day arrive
at this planetary system.

31:37.275 --> 31:39.551
For this mission
to succeed,

31:39.586 --> 31:45.000
successive generations
would have to live
and die in transit.

31:51.137 --> 31:54.172
Unless science can find
a better solution.

32:02.206 --> 32:06.827
In the movies,
interstellar astronauts
are deep-frozen

32:06.862 --> 32:10.655
and resuscitated when
they reach their destination.

32:12.965 --> 32:16.172
There are major institutions
around the world

32:16.206 --> 32:19.379
who are taking this cue
from science fiction.

32:23.586 --> 32:28.517
At the European Space Agency's
medical lab in Cologne,

32:28.551 --> 32:31.344
space surgeon,
Adrianos Golemis

32:31.379 --> 32:37.517
is at the forefront
of how to ready astronauts
for interstellar voyages.

32:37.551 --> 32:41.172
Wouldn't it be great
when humanity ventures
further into the cosmos,

32:41.206 --> 32:43.413
to use the concept
of hibernation?

32:43.448 --> 32:45.758
This is something we observe
in the animal kingdom.

32:45.793 --> 32:48.344
And there's definitely a lot
we can learn from nature.

32:48.379 --> 32:52.655
So, what we know is that
when animals hibernate,
they use less energy,

32:52.689 --> 32:54.689
and for a long period of time,

32:54.724 --> 32:57.172
with less energy,
they can survive.

32:57.206 --> 32:59.206
That's very practical
for space flight.

32:59.241 --> 33:02.310
Because imagine
if you want to go on
a very long-duration mission.

33:02.344 --> 33:06.758
Then if you are in
a hibernated state,
you would need less food.

33:11.034 --> 33:13.310
So, the device
I am in right now,

33:13.344 --> 33:16.724
it's based on the concept
of indirect calorimetry.

33:16.758 --> 33:18.206
What does this mean?

33:18.241 --> 33:22.931
Calorimetry, so it
measures how much energy
does my body need per day.

33:22.965 --> 33:25.379
It's indirect, because this
is actually measured

33:25.413 --> 33:27.206
by the air that I breathe
in and out.

33:27.241 --> 33:28.379
That's why I'm in this canopy.

33:28.413 --> 33:30.034
In the future,
we can assume that

33:30.068 --> 33:35.586
we will use the same concept
to calculate how much energy
does the body need

33:35.620 --> 33:37.586
also for hibernation.

33:37.620 --> 33:40.931
We know it's gonna be less
than the energy we use
in everyday life.

33:40.965 --> 33:43.103
But as every person
is different,

33:43.137 --> 33:45.413
so one astronaut is different
to another one,

33:45.448 --> 33:49.482
we need to calculate
precisely how much energy
would I need to fly

33:49.517 --> 33:53.931
or much energy would you need,
actually, to fly in space,
in a hibernated state.

33:56.896 --> 34:01.137
Lifeless like
Snow White in a Perspex box,

34:01.172 --> 34:04.758
one wonders what
the astronauts might feel.

34:07.206 --> 34:10.172
Essentially it's like
a state of deep sleep.

34:10.206 --> 34:14.586
But, again,
this is what we know
from researching animals,

34:14.620 --> 34:18.379
and people that, for example,
go into major surgery.

34:18.413 --> 34:20.103
I do not know
if we will have dreams.

34:20.137 --> 34:23.068
We have to ask
the future astronauts on that.

34:23.103 --> 34:27.000
The next step
sounds straight from
a Hollywood script.

34:27.034 --> 34:31.793
Interstellar travelers
could be put into
suspended animation.

34:35.275 --> 34:39.034
Incredibly, this is already
being done today.

34:39.068 --> 34:42.931
But the people pioneering
these radical methods

34:42.965 --> 34:46.034
have nothing to do with
space exploration.

34:46.068 --> 34:49.172
...0.50 now,
he is not breathing.

34:49.827 --> 34:51.206
One, two, three.

34:52.206 --> 34:54.758
At the Maryland
Medical Center,

34:54.793 --> 34:58.344
pioneering surgeons
have masterminded

34:58.379 --> 35:03.724
an innovative procedure
for severe gunshot wounds.

35:03.758 --> 35:07.448
We have
a young male,
multiple gunshot wounds,

35:07.482 --> 35:10.758
penetrating injuries
to the right shoulder region

35:10.793 --> 35:13.724
and two penetrating injuries
to the lower abdomen.

35:13.758 --> 35:16.586
-Could we please order
a massive transfusion?

35:16.620 --> 35:23.827
Patients with
extreme bullet injuries have
a survival rate of just 7%.

35:23.862 --> 35:27.758
There just isn't enough time
to fix their wounds.

35:27.793 --> 35:30.275
I think
he's in hemorrhagic...
Oh, he's arrested.

35:30.310 --> 35:31.137
Asystole.

35:34.241 --> 35:37.482
Doctors
are working on ways
around the problem.

35:40.482 --> 35:43.448
In order to buy
40 minutes of time,

35:43.482 --> 35:49.068
they have devised a procedure
to slow down the metabolism
of their patients.

35:50.551 --> 35:55.172
By cooling patients rapidly,
they protect the whole body.

35:57.413 --> 36:01.758
The unique aspect
here is that we're preserving
not only specific organs,

36:01.793 --> 36:04.034
but the entire body
and multiple organs,

36:04.068 --> 36:06.896
including the brain,
liver, heart, lungs

36:06.931 --> 36:10.793
and all the other
essential organs,
including the intestines.

36:10.827 --> 36:12.724
Okay, we're gonna
cool him down to 20.

36:15.068 --> 36:18.896
Doctors
replace the blood
with a saline solution,

36:18.931 --> 36:24.172
cooled to 20 degrees Celsius
or 68 degrees Fahrenheit.

36:28.206 --> 36:32.827
Within minutes,
the patient has entered
a state of hypothermia.

36:36.586 --> 36:41.241
This procedure could be
the nucleus of a revolution
in space travel.

36:43.862 --> 36:46.896
I think
we're doing the groundwork,
the fundamentals here,

36:46.931 --> 36:52.310
so I do think that cooling
would be a part, for sure,
of any prolonged

36:52.344 --> 36:56.000
suspended animation
or travel of some sort.

36:56.034 --> 36:58.758
If you can reduce
the body's demand

36:58.793 --> 37:02.137
for oxygen and food
and stuff like that,

37:02.172 --> 37:04.655
then you can go further
and further out

37:04.689 --> 37:08.620
in a space situation,
by doing that, so...

37:08.655 --> 37:12.620
It may not end up
being the final result,

37:12.655 --> 37:16.344
but I think that that
temperature will play
a role in that.

37:19.931 --> 37:22.413
On interstellar
space missions,

37:22.448 --> 37:27.655
the suspended animation
would have to last for months,
even years.

37:29.413 --> 37:30.689
But there is a problem.

37:32.655 --> 37:36.724
So there's a buildup
of a lot of potassium
and acid.

37:36.758 --> 37:40.413
And to successfully
navigate that,

37:40.448 --> 37:44.448
there would need to also be
a process to manage that

37:45.655 --> 37:49.034
and remove the potassium
and neutralize the acid.

37:52.758 --> 37:56.448
To use this method
for long-term space flights,

37:56.482 --> 37:59.137
scientists need to control
the buildup

37:59.172 --> 38:03.586
of acidic waste products
in the cooled astronauts.

38:07.137 --> 38:10.482
So far, this seems
to be impossible.

38:20.689 --> 38:24.551
Even if you could find
a way to freeze humans,

38:24.586 --> 38:28.965
a trip of many millennia would
be far from plain sailing.

38:31.689 --> 38:36.931
Some crew members
would have to be awake
to watch over the spacecraft

38:36.965 --> 38:39.689
and the passenger
support systems.

38:44.137 --> 38:47.586
To keep the mission
going across the centuries,

38:47.620 --> 38:52.206
the crew would have
to renew itself
by having children.

38:54.172 --> 38:57.827
But conceiving offspring
in space is challenging.

38:58.689 --> 39:01.034
In the confines
of a spaceship,

39:01.068 --> 39:04.758
astronauts would have
a limited choice of partners.

39:20.896 --> 39:26.275
Back in Colorado,
there's a man with concerns
about procreating like this.

39:33.275 --> 39:37.137
Simon Dube,
a leading space sexologist,

39:37.172 --> 39:40.344
is worried about
interstellar inbreeding.

39:42.586 --> 39:46.275
If we don't have enough
people on these space flights
or colonies,

39:46.310 --> 39:47.827
it's going to create
a situation where

39:47.862 --> 39:50.000
some individuals will
have to reproduce

39:50.034 --> 39:54.551
with people who have
DNA that are closely
related to one another.

39:54.586 --> 39:58.758
This increases the risk
of genetic diseases
or congenital malformation.

40:01.068 --> 40:03.517
In a situation where
we have long-term

40:03.551 --> 40:05.413
multi-generational
space flight,

40:05.448 --> 40:10.620
we need to find ways
to bring enough genetic
diversity to our sample.

40:11.931 --> 40:15.206
Refreshing
the gene pool would
be essential.

40:15.241 --> 40:18.965
Or, after 5,000 years
of inbreeding,

40:19.000 --> 40:23.482
the crew would arrive
transformed
into bizarre mutants.

40:25.827 --> 40:29.172
Estimates vary
as to how many colonists

40:29.206 --> 40:31.655
would ensure
a healthy gene mix.

40:33.137 --> 40:34.620
Researchers
have estimated

40:34.655 --> 40:39.586
that we might need
up to 40,000 individuals
or maybe even less than 100.

40:40.482 --> 40:42.620
Those who argue
for small numbers

40:42.655 --> 40:44.862
usually take into account
that in these situations,

40:44.896 --> 40:47.206
we might wanna use
genetic technology.

40:47.241 --> 40:49.206
So, for instance,
bringing with us a bank

40:49.241 --> 40:52.310
of fertilized eggs
that will be progressively
implemented

40:52.344 --> 40:56.448
to provide that genetic
diversity in the colony
or aboard the spaceships.

40:58.551 --> 41:06.034
But genetic health
isn't the only sex issue
we need to deal with in space.

41:06.068 --> 41:09.241
Space imposes
all kinds of challenges
on human sexuality,

41:09.275 --> 41:11.413
including partnered sex.

41:11.448 --> 41:15.068
So one of them is the fact
that there's no gravity,

41:15.103 --> 41:17.758
so in zero gravity
or microgravity,

41:17.793 --> 41:21.448
it might be difficult
to bring partners close
to one another,

41:21.482 --> 41:24.827
because each time one
pushes the other,
or makes a movement,

41:24.862 --> 41:28.310
it will propel
the other person away.

41:28.344 --> 41:32.620
So we need to find
contraptions, garments,
or technical systems

41:32.655 --> 41:35.103
to keep people close
from one another,

41:35.137 --> 41:38.103
so that they can enjoy
sexual activities together.

41:40.965 --> 41:44.586
Undeterred
by such perplexing matters,

41:44.620 --> 41:49.862
Simon thinks one shouldn't
view space sex
as a problem.

41:49.896 --> 41:54.000
Imagine what it would mean
to be weightless
for human sexuality.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.965
You could move around.

41:59.103 --> 42:04.655
In zero gravity,
you can enjoy
sexual activities,

42:04.689 --> 42:06.172
including with multiple
partners,

42:07.965 --> 42:09.448
in total weightlessness.

42:10.620 --> 42:14.172
What would that mean
for our sexual behavior,

42:14.206 --> 42:17.275
our preferences
and our fantasies?

42:17.310 --> 42:21.068
I think in a space context,
it would completely
change them

42:21.103 --> 42:24.724
and enable new frontiers
for human sexuality.

42:33.931 --> 42:36.620
Despite
these hopeful prospects,

42:36.655 --> 42:41.310
scientists sending
out colonists
in generation ships

42:41.344 --> 42:45.000
will have to deal
with our bodies.

42:45.034 --> 42:48.310
We are just too frail
to thrive away from Earth.

42:50.724 --> 42:54.827
But, astonishingly,
there is a man
in New York City

42:54.862 --> 42:57.896
who's certain he can
overcome this obstacle.

43:00.965 --> 43:04.620
We meet the NASA geneticist
Christopher Mason

43:04.655 --> 43:08.586
in his laboratory
at Weill Cornell
Medical College.

43:10.448 --> 43:12.655
He knows what
he's up against.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.689
The human body
was never built for space.

43:16.724 --> 43:19.655
There are extraordinarily
difficult terrains

43:19.689 --> 43:21.862
and environments
that we would have
to survive in,

43:21.896 --> 43:26.517
so, sulfuric acid rain
or crushing gravity
or radiation,

43:26.551 --> 43:29.068
that would kill a person
in less than a day.

43:29.103 --> 43:31.000
Even within our solar system,
there's places
we've already seen

43:31.034 --> 43:34.068
that are completely
inhospitable to human life

43:34.103 --> 43:36.034
and we have to find
a way around them.

43:36.068 --> 43:38.517
For every astronaut
that's gone into space, ever,

43:38.551 --> 43:42.275
we have considered physical
protective measures,
pharmacological measures,

43:42.310 --> 43:44.827
to keep them safe
and keep them healthy
and active.

43:44.862 --> 43:47.379
But we now are
on the cusp
of actually implementing

43:47.413 --> 43:50.965
genetic measures,
actually, cellular changes,
that can keep them safe.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.655
So, instead of just having
defenses on the outside
of the body,

43:53.689 --> 43:56.965
we can activate defenses
that are already present
on the inside of the body

43:57.000 --> 43:58.137
and even add new ones.

44:00.724 --> 44:03.068
Up until
a few years ago,

44:03.103 --> 44:06.862
editing the human gene
was science fiction.

44:06.896 --> 44:10.310
Today, geneticists
are on the verge

44:10.344 --> 44:14.000
of making humans fit
for interstellar travel.

44:16.862 --> 44:21.620
The most damaging
threat is radiation.

44:21.655 --> 44:25.379
The biggest risk
of radiation is that it
damages your DNA and proteins

44:25.413 --> 44:27.068
and doesn't let
your cells survive.

44:27.103 --> 44:31.862
So, what we do
is take proteins
from our own DNA,

44:31.896 --> 44:35.275
our own genome
and also from other creatures,
like tardigrades

44:35.310 --> 44:38.896
and take those snippets
of genes we know that give
additional protection

44:38.931 --> 44:40.655
and we basically
copy them out,
clone them

44:40.689 --> 44:42.103
and then put them
into human cells.

44:47.551 --> 44:51.931
Christopher
Mason particularly
enjoys snipping genes

44:51.965 --> 44:55.689
from these droll
micro-animals,
tardigrades.

44:58.689 --> 45:02.482
Tardigrades are these
cute little tiny water bears,
they're often called,

45:02.517 --> 45:04.275
because they look
like a little bear.

45:04.310 --> 45:06.724
And they are a species
that is found in soils

45:06.758 --> 45:08.620
and surfaces
all over the Earth.

45:08.655 --> 45:11.448
They're just small,
little multicellular
little bears,

45:11.482 --> 45:13.931
that can survive
almost anywhere.

45:13.965 --> 45:16.689
High radiation,
they can survive
the vacuum of space,

45:16.724 --> 45:18.931
even come back
and then be rehydrated.

45:18.965 --> 45:21.206
They can survive
dry conditions.

45:21.241 --> 45:24.000
So they're really
extraordinary creatures.

45:24.034 --> 45:26.827
So, now let's go see
if we can check on the cells.

45:26.862 --> 45:30.655
Now, let's see
how the tardigrade
and human cells are doing.

45:30.689 --> 45:32.413
Take a peek at Craig,
who should be in here.

45:33.275 --> 45:34.827
-Hey, Craig.
-Hey.

45:34.862 --> 45:36.931
All right,
so how do they look?

45:36.965 --> 45:38.655
Yeah, we're just spinning
them down right now.

45:38.689 --> 45:40.620
Allowing
the centrifuge
to spin down, great.

45:44.655 --> 45:47.655
These cells
floating in this pink bath

45:47.689 --> 45:52.344
of nutrients, belong
to no species ever known.

45:52.379 --> 45:58.758
They are a completely
artificial blend
of water bear and human.

45:58.793 --> 46:03.000
We've made human cells
that carry the lessons
from the tardigrade

46:03.034 --> 46:06.000
inside their DNA
and enable it to resist

46:06.034 --> 46:09.310
up to 80% more
radiation than they
could before.

46:09.344 --> 46:13.827
All human
cells which carry
the radiation-resistant gene

46:13.862 --> 46:18.724
of tardigrades will
light up under the microscope.

46:18.758 --> 46:21.551
Christopher Mason
is delighted to see

46:21.586 --> 46:24.620
that the experiment
has worked out.

46:24.655 --> 46:31.000
Opening up a pathway
to even more fanciful
genetic modifications.

46:31.034 --> 46:34.827
One of the challenges
is that you have very low
light in long space flight,

46:34.862 --> 46:36.689
you have limited resources.

46:36.724 --> 46:39.689
So what if you captured
every photon and turned
it into food?

46:39.724 --> 46:43.241
Or what if we could have
chlorophyll inside
human cells?

46:43.275 --> 46:46.068
Really like chloro-humans,
or plants, basically.

46:46.103 --> 46:49.068
What if we could just
lay out in the sun
when you're hungry,

46:49.103 --> 46:51.896
get enough nutrients
and then go back in the shade
when you're all full.

46:51.931 --> 46:56.068
To do this in space,
you would need about two
tennis courts' worth of skin

46:56.103 --> 46:58.586
to lay out and get
enough sunlight,

46:58.620 --> 47:01.551
on Earth at least,
to get enough food
for one day.

47:01.586 --> 47:05.862
So if you could imagine
having that much skin
you could kind of roll it out,

47:05.896 --> 47:09.965
let it absorb and then roll
it back in, kind of like
a portable solar panel.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.103
Except it's your own skin.

47:18.793 --> 47:22.896
This new
space superhuman
would know no limits.

47:22.931 --> 47:27.448
It will breathe helium
and dive into
the Boomerang Nebula.

47:30.137 --> 47:34.000
That is, if it ever
sees the light of day.

47:35.620 --> 47:39.344
Our lab
has a 500-year plan
to enact this dream

47:39.379 --> 47:42.000
of having humans survive
under the light of a new sun.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.034
I will be dead
for the vast majority
of this plan,

47:46.068 --> 47:47.793
but the point
is that we've laid out

47:47.827 --> 47:49.931
what can happen
and I think should happen.

47:52.275 --> 47:54.586
We've learned a lot
about genetics
in the past ten years,

47:54.620 --> 47:56.310
that's phase one.

47:56.344 --> 48:00.206
In the next 20 years,
we actually take these lessons
and knowledge of genetics

48:00.241 --> 48:02.551
and engineer these cells,
engineer genomes

48:02.586 --> 48:05.034
to contain lessons
from other creatures

48:05.068 --> 48:06.931
to help them survive
extreme environments.

48:06.965 --> 48:09.068
And by phase ten,
in 500 years,
we actually launch.

48:09.103 --> 48:13.965
We will have had the knowledge
of genetics to know what to do
to protect the astronauts

48:14.000 --> 48:17.241
and we'll have the exoplanets
discovered so we know
to where we can send them.

48:23.103 --> 48:29.275
But if genetically
enhanced humans ever ventured
out to conquer the galaxy,

48:29.310 --> 48:33.862
they would have to adapt
not just their bodies
but their minds.

48:36.379 --> 48:40.310
And that might be an even
more vexing issue.

48:40.344 --> 48:43.206
Our challenge
would be to stay sane.

48:43.241 --> 48:48.000
locked for generations
in a ship on course
into the unknown.

48:55.413 --> 48:58.793
Space anthropologist,
Taylor Genovese,

48:58.827 --> 49:02.172
is convinced we'd be
at each other's throats

49:02.206 --> 49:04.379
before we even
reached halfway.

49:07.034 --> 49:13.689
The day-to-day of living,
as anyone who
has cohabited knows,

49:13.724 --> 49:16.931
the smallest of irritants

49:16.965 --> 49:21.103
can explode
into dramatic fights.

49:21.137 --> 49:26.275
Somebody clinks
their fork on a plate
the wrong way,

49:26.310 --> 49:27.862
can explode into a fight.

49:27.896 --> 49:31.103
The problem becomes
you can't escape it,

49:31.137 --> 49:33.620
you can't remove
yourself to cool down,

49:33.655 --> 49:36.137
because you're always
in close proximity.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.827
The Antarctic stations
are really great

49:44.862 --> 49:48.758
because you can see
how people are going to react

49:48.793 --> 49:51.793
within a very
hostile environment.

49:51.827 --> 49:56.448
In the past few years
there was an apparent issue
that someone on a Russian crew

49:56.482 --> 50:00.655
was giving away the endings
of the books from the library

50:00.689 --> 50:03.482
to another Russian
crew member on purpose,

50:03.517 --> 50:06.068
maliciously telling him
the ends of books.

50:06.103 --> 50:11.275
So much so, that then
the other crew member
could no longer take it,

50:11.310 --> 50:13.551
went into the kitchen,
grabbed a butcher knife

50:13.586 --> 50:15.517
and stabbed
the other crew member.

50:15.551 --> 50:20.931
And they needed
to then, of course,
evacuate them out.

50:20.965 --> 50:24.413
But in outer space,
you're not gonna
be able to have that.

50:27.620 --> 50:31.655
Even more dangerously,
if somebody gets very angry

50:31.689 --> 50:36.034
and decides to, say,
open an airlock
or puncture something

50:36.068 --> 50:38.034
in the settlement
or the spacecraft

50:38.068 --> 50:40.172
then that endangers
everybody on board.

50:40.206 --> 50:43.000
There are going
to be problems.

50:43.034 --> 50:45.379
There are going
to be issues
between people.

50:45.413 --> 50:49.482
And how are we going
to deal with this?
It's not being talked about.

50:59.689 --> 51:05.689
While mental health
on long-term space missions
is a taboo subject

51:05.724 --> 51:08.344
it has been researched
in the past.

51:10.689 --> 51:14.586
In New Jersey, we meet someone
who was a guinea pig

51:14.620 --> 51:19.862
in a Moscow
isolation experiment
in the 1990s.

51:21.793 --> 51:26.655
For the first time,
Canadian nursing professor
Judith Lapierre

51:26.689 --> 51:29.724
breaks her silence
on the Russian study

51:29.758 --> 51:32.551
that was to create
an international scandal.

51:34.344 --> 51:40.137
I was very enthusiastic
about getting involved
in such a big project

51:40.172 --> 51:45.827
because at that time,
it represented the longest
confinement studies

51:45.862 --> 51:49.310
with an international crew
and a mixed-gender crew.

51:49.344 --> 51:53.000
So I was really excited
and proud. This was
a dream come true, actually.

51:56.793 --> 52:00.103
The experiment involved
Judith being locked up

52:00.137 --> 52:06.137
in a large,
metal barrel
for 110 days.

52:06.172 --> 52:12.068
She and the group of men
would live there confined
and observed around the clock.

52:14.827 --> 52:18.931
Judith Lapierre felt primed
for the challenge.

52:21.137 --> 52:23.931
I'm the woman
taking part in this crew

52:23.965 --> 52:27.344
so we are training now
for the starting
of the experiment.

52:28.862 --> 52:32.310
I would have loved, of course,
there would be more women

52:32.344 --> 52:35.103
because I think
it would be great
for me as support, also,

52:35.137 --> 52:40.137
and real life is
involving both genders,
so there should be more,

52:40.172 --> 52:42.103
but unfortunately,
there's only one so far.

52:44.827 --> 52:51.103
On December 4, 1999,
Judith was ready
to be locked in the barrel

52:51.137 --> 52:56.827
as part of an international
crew that was to join
a Russian crew inside.

52:58.827 --> 53:04.137
I remember following
each other in a line
and going inside the chamber,

53:04.172 --> 53:09.379
closing the doors
and there we were starting
our 110 days' mission.

53:09.413 --> 53:14.241
And it was a very intense
schedule, we had over
100 studies to run.

53:14.275 --> 53:18.206
and the days
would last from 8:00
until 10:00 at night.

53:21.793 --> 53:24.827
Judith settled
into her new life,

53:24.862 --> 53:29.103
comfortably dropping
into a work routine
with her colleagues.

53:34.896 --> 53:40.137
From the control room
the supervisors witnessed
how the crew bonded.

53:42.344 --> 53:48.379
Nobody had the slightest
notion that the experiment
was to go disastrously wrong.

53:52.379 --> 53:55.586
The ambience and the dynamic
of the chamber changed

53:55.620 --> 53:58.379
that evening
of New Year's, 2000.

53:59.862 --> 54:02.620
It was a kind
of a celebration
of course,

54:02.655 --> 54:05.000
we had an initial
meal together

54:06.586 --> 54:12.551
and a little after midnight,
there was a fight
between Russian crew members.

54:12.586 --> 54:15.931
It was a very violent
and aggressive fight

54:15.965 --> 54:18.655
that left one
crew member
very injured.

54:21.482 --> 54:25.206
Judith expected
the men in the control room
to intervene...

54:27.689 --> 54:29.379
but no one came.

54:33.448 --> 54:36.000
This was just one
part of an evening

54:36.034 --> 54:39.551
that was to spiral
much further
out of control.

54:41.137 --> 54:43.689
We couldn't sleep
after those incidents

54:43.724 --> 54:45.310
so we stayed
in the living room.

54:45.344 --> 54:50.586
And then the Russian
crew member
was starting to make jokes

54:50.620 --> 54:54.724
about doing an experiment
that would involve myself.

54:54.758 --> 55:00.758
He had stopped smoking
and he wanted to test
kissing without smoking,

55:00.793 --> 55:04.655
in front of everybody.
So I said, "No way,

55:04.689 --> 55:07.551
I'm not gonna take part
in any of this,
what do you mean?"

55:07.586 --> 55:13.448
And he pulled me up
from my chair.
I sat down again.

55:13.482 --> 55:18.137
He pulled me again
and I looked at my friends,
my commander, saying,

55:18.172 --> 55:20.689
"What's he doing now,
he's pulling me out?"

55:20.724 --> 55:23.206
you know, to go
in the kitchen area again.

55:23.241 --> 55:27.862
That's when he decided
that he would kiss me forcibly

55:27.896 --> 55:31.793
and I pushed him away,
he did again
and I pushed him.

55:31.827 --> 55:36.068
And I left the kitchen,
went back to my colleagues

55:36.103 --> 55:39.068
and I was in shock
because that whole evening

55:39.103 --> 55:42.448
had a whole
atmosphere already
and I couldn't believe it.

55:53.068 --> 55:55.931
The next day we did write
to mission control

55:55.965 --> 55:58.310
and to our respective
space agencies.

55:58.344 --> 56:01.206
And it took
until four
to five days,

56:01.241 --> 56:06.310
they sent to us
a paper through
the hatch doors

56:06.344 --> 56:09.551
and they told us
you should sign this

56:09.586 --> 56:11.551
or you may leave,
you're free to go.

56:11.586 --> 56:16.758
And so we were
kind of forced to sign
if we wanted to stay.

56:16.793 --> 56:18.689
And, of course,
I wanted to stay.

56:21.620 --> 56:23.620
The paper
Judith signed

56:23.655 --> 56:28.103
said that the incident
was just a cultural
misunderstanding.

56:29.896 --> 56:35.620
And I can't say no to that.
It was a sexual interest
that he had in me

56:35.655 --> 56:39.793
and he forcibly
kissed me twice
and I rejected him.

56:39.827 --> 56:42.551
But it was not
recognized as such

56:42.586 --> 56:46.827
and it was just minimized as
a cultural misunderstanding.

56:46.862 --> 56:51.068
Saying that I wasn't
open enough to
cultural diversity.

56:58.620 --> 57:00.137
When that mission finished,

57:01.413 --> 57:03.758
it really influenced
my whole career,

57:03.793 --> 57:07.586
because I thought
this would be the start
of my research project

57:07.620 --> 57:11.655
with the Space Agency
or the start of my field
of work.

57:11.689 --> 57:15.724
But I was just totally
pushed out of the system.

57:15.758 --> 57:20.137
And I have not been involved
in any space work ever since.

57:34.655 --> 57:38.241
Drawing on
the experience
of Judith Lapierre,

57:38.275 --> 57:41.965
one concludes that hurtling
through the centuries

57:42.000 --> 57:47.241
in a spaceship,
would end in strife,
crime and depravity.

57:54.896 --> 57:59.034
If we are to stand a chance
to reach exoplanets,

57:59.068 --> 58:02.965
we need to figure out how
to get there in a lifetime.

58:04.965 --> 58:08.517
But could we invent
a spacecraft fast enough?

58:17.034 --> 58:20.620
In Idaho, we are back
with Marshall Savage,

58:20.655 --> 58:24.689
visionary science educator
and futurologist.

58:26.310 --> 58:31.724
Marshall has an idea
how we can supercharge
future spacecraft.

58:34.793 --> 58:39.000
Einstein taught us
energy and matter
are inter-exchangeable,

58:39.034 --> 58:42.551
and a very little bit
of matter is a huge amount
of energy.

58:42.586 --> 58:46.586
But the only real,
viable way to make
that conversion,

58:46.620 --> 58:49.206
to get all the energy
out of a piece of matter,

58:49.241 --> 58:50.689
is by having antimatter.

58:50.724 --> 58:53.379
Because when matter
and antimatter meet,

58:53.413 --> 58:56.793
they annihilate each other
and the result is pure energy.

58:58.931 --> 59:03.448
So, if you could manufacture
and store enough antimatter,

59:03.482 --> 59:08.137
it then becomes possible
to have energy on the scale
of photon propulsion.

59:08.172 --> 59:12.103
What that means is that
instead of hot chemicals
coming out of the rocket,

59:12.137 --> 59:15.413
or fast fusion particles
coming out of the rocket,

59:15.448 --> 59:17.862
you have photons
coming out of the rocket,

59:17.896 --> 59:19.275
and they're traveling
at the speed of light.

59:29.551 --> 59:34.034
Antimatter fuel
would get us around
the galaxy in no time.

59:40.931 --> 59:43.551
As impossible as it may sound,

59:43.586 --> 59:49.862
antimatter is both
already manufactured
and stored on Earth today.

59:49.896 --> 59:55.241
In Geneva,
physicist Michael Doser
harvests antimatter

59:55.275 --> 59:57.896
at the particle
accelerator, CERN.

59:59.655 --> 1:00:03.689
It's actually pretty easy
to make antimatter
and to work with it.

1:00:03.724 --> 1:00:06.413
All you need is
a Proton Synchrotron,

1:00:06.448 --> 1:00:09.551
where you accelerate particles
to very high energies,

1:00:09.586 --> 1:00:12.413
smash those into
a block of iridium,

1:00:12.448 --> 1:00:15.000
and if you're really lucky,
one in a million,

1:00:15.034 --> 1:00:17.551
you get a pair
of a proton
and antiproton.

1:00:17.586 --> 1:00:21.241
These antiprotons are moving
almost at the speed of light,

1:00:21.275 --> 1:00:22.689
rush into this building,

1:00:22.724 --> 1:00:25.758
and are then slowed down
in the structures
that you can see here.

1:00:25.793 --> 1:00:29.896
So, there's a big
decelerator surrounding
the building itself,

1:00:29.931 --> 1:00:31.448
underneath
the concrete blocks.

1:00:31.482 --> 1:00:35.000
Then they go down into
this little ring here,

1:00:35.034 --> 1:00:36.482
which is the final stage,

1:00:36.517 --> 1:00:39.827
which slows them down
to such low energies
that we can catch them.

1:00:44.827 --> 1:00:49.275
Making antimatter
is easy, if you happen
to be at CERN,

1:00:49.310 --> 1:00:53.206
the world's largest
nuclear research facility.

1:00:53.241 --> 1:00:58.068
The center hosts scientists
from 85 nations

1:00:58.103 --> 1:01:03.482
and consumes more electricity
than 300,000 homes a year.

1:01:11.137 --> 1:01:16.000
CERN might be the home
of some of the biggest
hardware ever built,

1:01:16.034 --> 1:01:20.689
but in particle physics
some of the most
impressive gear

1:01:20.724 --> 1:01:22.275
can be quite unassuming.

1:01:24.551 --> 1:01:28.034
This is the heart
of the matter,
or of the antimatter.

1:01:28.068 --> 1:01:30.206
This is what an antimatter
trap looks like,

1:01:30.241 --> 1:01:34.172
and this is, in fact,
a trap that we used about
10,15 years ago.

1:01:34.206 --> 1:01:36.379
And what you see here is

1:01:36.413 --> 1:01:39.413
something that will hold
antimatter without touching
any matter.

1:01:39.448 --> 1:01:42.655
Because, of course, when
antimatter and matter touch,
they annihilate.

1:01:42.689 --> 1:01:45.172
So we need to hold
the antimatter in vacuum,

1:01:45.206 --> 1:01:48.655
and only touch it
with electric fields
and magnetic fields.

1:01:52.275 --> 1:01:56.310
Unfortunately,
the amount of energy required

1:01:56.344 --> 1:01:59.931
to make antimatter
is enormous.

1:01:59.965 --> 1:02:06.000
120 gigawatts are
needed to create even
the tiniest amounts

1:02:06.034 --> 1:02:08.310
of this mysterious substance.

1:02:09.172 --> 1:02:11.758
And the output
is ridiculously low.

1:02:13.965 --> 1:02:17.034
All the antimatter
produced at CERN

1:02:17.068 --> 1:02:19.482
wouldn't power
a single lightbulb.

1:02:23.896 --> 1:02:29.103
Michael Doser works
with only minute quantities
of antimatter.

1:02:31.344 --> 1:02:33.965
And there is another problem.

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.344
The sheer amount
of time required to
manufacture antimatter.

1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:45.724
At CERN, if the accelerator
were to give us antiprotons
every second,

1:02:45.758 --> 1:02:47.379
and we could cool them
down that fast,

1:02:47.413 --> 1:02:52.103
we'd end up with something
of the order of a tenth
of a nanogram per year.

1:02:52.137 --> 1:02:56.517
Which means, that in order
to get one gram of antimatter
you need 10 billion years,

1:02:56.551 --> 1:02:58.896
which just happens to be
the age of the universe.

1:02:58.931 --> 1:03:02.551
So if you'd started collecting
antiprotons at the beginning
of the universe,

1:03:02.586 --> 1:03:03.862
at the moment of the big bang,

1:03:03.896 --> 1:03:05.793
we'd now have 1 gram
of antimatter.

1:03:08.448 --> 1:03:12.724
Even if this lengthy
production process
were practical,

1:03:12.758 --> 1:03:19.310
could we ever generate
enough fuel to get us
to the next solar system?

1:03:19.344 --> 1:03:24.586
Now, to get to Alpha Centauri,
my reference is Star Trek,
which has the Enterprise.

1:03:24.620 --> 1:03:28.206
And in the Enterprise
there's this huge warp core
running with antimatter.

1:03:28.241 --> 1:03:30.655
That's a couple of tons'
worth of antimatter,

1:03:30.689 --> 1:03:34.896
but we can be a bit more
economical than that,
and call it a few kilograms.

1:03:34.931 --> 1:03:38.344
Which means that,
not only do you need
10 billion years,

1:03:38.379 --> 1:03:42.344
you actually need something
like a factor of 1,000
or 10,000 more than that,

1:03:42.379 --> 1:03:46.379
which is probably longer
than the age of the universe
into the future.

1:03:46.413 --> 1:03:49.931
And that's the amount of time
you need, under current
technological conditions

1:03:49.965 --> 1:03:52.517
to make enough antimatter
to get to Alpha Centauri.

1:03:52.551 --> 1:03:54.620
You'd be faster off
walking to get there.

1:04:15.655 --> 1:04:19.000
For now,
interstellar space travel

1:04:19.034 --> 1:04:21.862
remains in the realm
of science fiction.

1:04:28.034 --> 1:04:32.000
Unless, of course,
we get help from
outer space.

1:04:34.827 --> 1:04:38.206
If there were
technically-advanced
aliens out there,

1:04:38.241 --> 1:04:41.275
we could just ask them
to let us hitch a ride.

1:04:56.241 --> 1:05:00.068
Those of us
hoping to get a lift
from a UFO

1:05:00.103 --> 1:05:07.448
should best direct
their request to this colony
of extraterrestrials on Earth.

1:05:07.482 --> 1:05:11.551
In the Valley of the Dawn,
in Brazil, live people who
believe they are

1:05:11.586 --> 1:05:16.517
the descendants
of an alien species
from the planet Capella.

1:06:04.965 --> 1:06:09.103
The knowledge about
the extraterrestrial
history of the valley

1:06:09.137 --> 1:06:12.241
goes back to this woman,
Tia Neiva.

1:06:15.275 --> 1:06:22.172
Born Neiva Zelaya,
Tia Neiva was a truck driver
and single mother of four.

1:06:22.206 --> 1:06:28.620
When she died in 1984,
her followers preserved
her house as she had left it.

1:06:31.758 --> 1:06:34.931
They even turned her bathroom
into a shrine.

1:06:38.620 --> 1:06:43.448
Photographs show how from
the 1960s onwards,

1:06:43.482 --> 1:06:46.034
she started receiving
cosmic energy.

1:06:50.275 --> 1:06:53.758
The energy is sent down
from the alien mothership

1:06:53.793 --> 1:06:56.655
that hovers invisibly
above the valley.

1:07:23.551 --> 1:07:29.413
Tia Neiva's followers
are still harvesting
healing rays today

1:07:29.448 --> 1:07:32.413
transmitted down
by benevolent aliens.

1:07:34.517 --> 1:07:39.551
So could this energy
be used to whisk us away
to faraway planets?

1:08:24.103 --> 1:08:27.551
The aliens
of the valley
are stuck on Earth.

1:08:27.586 --> 1:08:33.275
In the course of millennia,
their bodies have adapted
to our environment,

1:08:33.310 --> 1:08:36.103
so there's no way back
to their home planet.

1:08:43.379 --> 1:08:46.758
Watching them draw
energy from outer space,

1:08:46.793 --> 1:08:49.655
we were mystified
by the experience.

1:08:49.689 --> 1:08:55.068
Which seemed at times
as perplexing as gazing
at a faraway galaxy.

1:09:22.310 --> 1:09:25.620
We left the aliens
of the Valley of Dawn

1:09:25.655 --> 1:09:28.655
with a certainty
that they would not be able

1:09:28.689 --> 1:09:31.241
to whisk us away
in their spacecraft.

1:09:36.206 --> 1:09:38.586
Our journey has shown us

1:09:38.620 --> 1:09:42.724
that we humans
should not behave
like interplanetary locusts

1:09:43.344 --> 1:09:45.689
grazing our planet empty

1:09:45.724 --> 1:09:47.965
and then moving onto the next.

1:09:50.655 --> 1:09:52.758
But should we be sad
about that?

1:10:01.965 --> 1:10:04.448
Since his journeys
to the stars,

1:10:04.482 --> 1:10:08.448
astronaut Mike Foale looks
at our planet differently.

1:10:11.206 --> 1:10:14.137
I've always loved astronomy.
I've always loved the galaxy.

1:10:14.172 --> 1:10:17.517
I've always loved the idea
of being on other planets
around other stars.

1:10:20.517 --> 1:10:24.000
But in the end
the thing that drove me
the most was looking at Earth.

1:10:34.586 --> 1:10:38.172
The Earth is always changing
and so the light changes,

1:10:38.206 --> 1:10:41.448
the seasons change,
the seasons
are always different.

1:10:41.482 --> 1:10:44.482
And it's so fascinating,
it's utterly absorbing.

1:10:47.827 --> 1:10:50.896
Coming over the southern tip
of South America,
and almost always,

1:10:50.931 --> 1:10:52.827
the lighting
is pretty low-angle.

1:10:52.862 --> 1:10:54.965
So it has a sort of
deep dark blue.

1:10:55.620 --> 1:10:56.655
Almost a mysterious...

1:10:56.689 --> 1:10:58.344
It looks cold, it is cold.

1:10:59.103 --> 1:11:00.103
But then you notice...

1:11:00.793 --> 1:11:01.931
I could see waves.

1:11:02.655 --> 1:11:05.000
And you go, "Waves?

1:11:05.034 --> 1:11:07.620
From this altitude?
No, no, that can't be right."

1:11:07.655 --> 1:11:12.655
Yes, you can see waves,
South Atlantic waves

1:11:12.689 --> 1:11:17.137
going all the way
around the planet
at that latitude.

1:11:17.172 --> 1:11:20.103
Because they're
so huge driven by
the winds down there,

1:11:20.137 --> 1:11:24.172
you can actually see
the combined froth of
all the breaking waves

1:11:24.206 --> 1:11:27.275
from space, from orbit,
from hundreds of miles away.

1:11:32.551 --> 1:11:36.172
I appreciate the Earth,
and the ecology of the Earth.

1:11:36.206 --> 1:11:40.896
And as something I need
to communicate as being
worthwhile looking after,

1:11:40.931 --> 1:11:42.586
far more after being in space.

1:11:54.068 --> 1:11:56.758
Back at
Mauna Kea, Hawaii,

1:11:56.793 --> 1:12:00.034
the telescopes are trained
into the skies

1:12:00.068 --> 1:12:04.931
searching for undiscovered
worlds that might one day
be colonized.

1:12:09.655 --> 1:12:14.931
Down on the plains,
native Hawaiians have
a very different idea

1:12:14.965 --> 1:12:18.379
of what humanity's place
in the cosmos should be.

1:12:28.137 --> 1:12:31.172
This is
a highly symbolic place.

1:12:31.206 --> 1:12:35.551
In this black wasteland
Nobel Prize-winning science

1:12:35.586 --> 1:12:37.931
collides with
indigenous knowledge.

1:12:43.793 --> 1:12:49.655
Hawaiian activist
Lanakila Mangauil
pays reverence to the volcano.

1:12:51.827 --> 1:12:55.172
For him, Mauna Kea
is a holy mountain

1:12:55.206 --> 1:12:57.413
not to be disturbed by humans.

1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.827
Astronomer Lucianne Walkowicz
has come down from the peak

1:13:07.862 --> 1:13:11.000
to listen and learn about
the Hawaiians' beliefs.

1:13:13.275 --> 1:13:18.793
Lanakila has agreed
to show Lucianne
how Mauna Kea is honored.

1:13:47.344 --> 1:13:50.517
The Hawaiians have
their own cosmology

1:13:50.551 --> 1:13:53.931
expressed in these
traditional songs and dances.

1:13:55.241 --> 1:13:58.931
Every little step
and gesture has
a significance

1:13:58.965 --> 1:14:01.482
connected with
the sacred volcano.

1:14:03.137 --> 1:14:06.620
Here on the mountain,
too much human footprints,
or walking,

1:14:06.655 --> 1:14:08.448
or shifting of the land

1:14:08.482 --> 1:14:11.758
disrupts the natural cycles
of the hydrology.

1:14:11.793 --> 1:14:13.413
From the snow, the ice,

1:14:13.448 --> 1:14:15.517
and how it needs
to percolate and move.

1:14:15.551 --> 1:14:18.379
So we have to allow
the forces of nature
to do its thing.

1:14:18.413 --> 1:14:22.586
So that very simple hula,
where you see us dancers

1:14:22.620 --> 1:14:24.689
retreating with
this very light tapping

1:14:24.724 --> 1:14:27.034
of their fingers
and light tapping
of their feet,

1:14:27.068 --> 1:14:31.965
and the backward motion
is to show we should be
exiting these places,

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.206
and leave as little
to no imprint at all.

1:14:35.241 --> 1:14:36.482
Not even our footprints.

1:14:42.517 --> 1:14:46.137
Lanakila sees humans
as a part of creation

1:14:46.172 --> 1:14:48.586
and we ignore this
at our peril.

1:14:53.517 --> 1:14:55.172
When you break away
from that thinking

1:14:55.206 --> 1:14:57.206
or if you think
yourself outside, or worse,

1:14:57.241 --> 1:14:59.034
you think yourself
superior to that,

1:15:00.586 --> 1:15:02.517
well, this is what you get.

1:15:02.551 --> 1:15:05.448
This is not
the indigenous ecosystem
of this land.

1:15:06.103 --> 1:15:08.655
This is after human impact.

1:15:08.689 --> 1:15:12.379
Has all the native forests
of this mountain be decimated.

1:15:21.137 --> 1:15:23.206
So what
do you think
when you hear people

1:15:23.241 --> 1:15:26.793
saying that, you know,
now that they have
used the Earth,

1:15:26.827 --> 1:15:28.827
they're going to go
to other planets?

1:15:28.862 --> 1:15:32.448
Say, planets around
other stars or Mars,
or wherever it happens to be?

1:15:33.103 --> 1:15:34.620
It's a scary thought for me

1:15:34.655 --> 1:15:37.379
to think of people
wanting to go
and their whole mission

1:15:37.413 --> 1:15:41.172
just to go and continue
the extraction process
on other planets.

1:15:42.034 --> 1:15:43.103
Absolutely not.

1:15:43.137 --> 1:15:46.827
You know, there's so much more
to learn right here.

1:15:46.862 --> 1:15:48.689
And so in many cases,
I think it's important

1:15:48.724 --> 1:15:51.137
that we need to protect
the rest of the universe
from us.

1:15:57.206 --> 1:16:02.551
Lucianne Walkowicz
has drawn conclusions
from this message.

1:16:06.068 --> 1:16:08.965
I think
the problem that I have
with colonization

1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:12.758
as described
by Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos,

1:16:12.793 --> 1:16:16.379
is that it really
does describe colonization.

1:16:16.413 --> 1:16:18.551
The idea of going places

1:16:18.586 --> 1:16:20.586
and extracting and exploiting.

1:16:20.620 --> 1:16:23.482
The same kind of colonization
projected into space

1:16:23.517 --> 1:16:26.517
that many people
have experienced
here on Earth.

1:16:26.551 --> 1:16:29.379
Now on Earth, we do face
existential threats.

1:16:29.413 --> 1:16:31.724
We do have things
like climate change

1:16:31.758 --> 1:16:35.413
that are creating
a less habitable world
than the one

1:16:35.448 --> 1:16:37.206
that has raised
our species thus far.

1:16:37.241 --> 1:16:40.379
And we can't afford
to treat our planet

1:16:40.413 --> 1:16:42.137
as though we can
just use it up,

1:16:42.172 --> 1:16:44.310
eat everything up,
and throw it away.

1:16:44.862 --> 1:16:45.896
We have one home.

1:16:52.551 --> 1:16:59.310
Looking at this world
I see such unbelievable,
soul-drenching,

1:16:59.344 --> 1:17:02.896
life-supporting richness
and lushness

1:17:02.931 --> 1:17:06.413
that exists on
no other planet
that we know of.

1:17:06.448 --> 1:17:09.862
And that even if
we were to find a planet
around another star

1:17:09.896 --> 1:17:13.172
that we think,
might potentially
be like this,

1:17:13.206 --> 1:17:14.586
we would have
no way of knowing,

1:17:14.620 --> 1:17:19.448
we have no way of
human beings reaching there
in our lifetimes.

1:17:19.482 --> 1:17:22.862
And yet here we are
surrounded by a paradise.

1:17:29.275 --> 1:17:32.758
I just feel so humbled by
the planet that we live on.

1:17:32.793 --> 1:17:36.793
Especially as someone
who thinks often
of other worlds.

1:17:36.827 --> 1:17:39.379
That I can swim in the ocean.

1:17:39.413 --> 1:17:42.103
That I can drink from streams.

1:17:42.137 --> 1:17:44.793
That I can sit out and feel
the sun on my face.

1:17:44.827 --> 1:17:47.482
And I know that it
doesn't just not harm me,

1:17:47.517 --> 1:17:50.413
it actually sustains
and nourishes me

1:17:50.448 --> 1:17:51.793
and everyone I know,

1:17:51.827 --> 1:17:55.689
and everyone
in all of humanity
that has ever lived.
