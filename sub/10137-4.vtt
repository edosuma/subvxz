07:26.529 --> 07:28.990
Alright. One. Two..

[instrumental music]

07:36.623 --> 07:38.708
[ripping]

07:39.709 --> 07:41.253
[gasps]

07:41.295 --> 07:43.504
Stop it! Stop it.

07:43.546 --> 07:44.589
Daddy!

07:44.631 --> 07:45.882
My planets!

07:45.924 --> 07:48.760
Oh, no! Why'd you guys

07:45.924 --> 07:48.760
have to do this?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.470
I worked so hard on this.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.638
Hey, hey, hey! What's going on?

07:51.679 --> 07:53.181
What's all the mayhem?

07:53.223 --> 07:55.392
Alex, Nicky,

07:53.223 --> 07:55.392
what did you guys do?

08:02.941 --> 08:05.610
- What happened?

08:02.941 --> 08:05.610
- What's going on, honey?

08:05.652 --> 08:09.739
Daddy, Nicky and Alex

08:05.652 --> 08:09.739
wrecked my solar system.

08:10.782 --> 08:14.161
Look, it's leaking sun juice.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.247
Oh, sweetheart,

08:14.202 --> 08:17.247
that's terrible.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.333
But I-I'm sure it was

08:17.289 --> 08:19.333
just an accident.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.335
Michelle, we are so sorry.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.753
Michelle, Nicky and Alex

08:21.376 --> 08:23.753
probably don't even realize

08:23.795 --> 08:24.921
they did anything wrong.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.214
But I told them to stop.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.882
Why didn't they listen?

08:27.924 --> 08:32.095
Well, Michelle, children have

08:27.924 --> 08:32.095
to be taught to listen.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.722
Who's supposed to teach them?

08:34.764 --> 08:36.099
'Well, uh..'

08:36.141 --> 08:39.394
...in-in many cases, uh,

08:36.141 --> 08:39.394
it's the people.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.313
The people who are

08:39.436 --> 08:41.313
responsible for their

08:41.355 --> 08:42.897
you know, their

08:41.355 --> 08:42.897
growth and well-being.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.524
Who's that?

08:44.565 --> 08:46.109
Well, in-in most cultures

08:46.151 --> 08:49.279
that-that would

08:46.151 --> 08:49.279
usually be, uh..

08:49.321 --> 08:50.697
...the parents.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.534
Way to go.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.661
[instrumental music]

09:00.123 --> 09:01.291
[instrumental music]

09:02.750 --> 09:05.837
Well, I'm sure Nicky and Alex

09:02.750 --> 09:05.837
feel very bad.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.506
Alright boys, now you tell..

09:07.547 --> 09:09.632
You tell your cousin

09:07.547 --> 09:09.632
that you're sorry.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.970
I sorry, Michelle.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.682
Are you really sorry?

09:17.724 --> 09:20.852
- No!

09:17.724 --> 09:20.852
- No! No!

09:20.894 --> 09:23.522
Alright, I'll take the boys

09:20.894 --> 09:23.522
before they incriminate

09:23.563 --> 09:25.940
themselves any further.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.940
Alright you two, come on.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.775
Let's go! Get in the squad car.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.653
You have the right to one phone

09:27.817 --> 09:30.653
call and one clean diaper.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.780
Let's go over here.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.951
Michelle, we feel terrible.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.661
I promise you,

09:36.993 --> 09:38.661
we'll make this up to you.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.038
Yeah, we're sorry, honey.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.038
You know what?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.498
I'll-I'll help you

09:40.080 --> 09:41.498
rebuild this, okay?

09:41.540 --> 09:42.832
I remodeled the whole attic.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.126
Certainly, I can rebuild

09:42.874 --> 09:45.126
the solar system.

09:45.168 --> 09:48.880
There's uh, there's no plumbing

09:45.168 --> 09:48.880
over there in space, is there?

09:50.382 --> 09:52.300
Okay, you're not laughing.

09:53.634 --> 09:57.305
Michelle, when a person

09:53.634 --> 09:57.305
is honestly sorry

09:57.347 --> 09:59.099
a big person will forgive them.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.226
But I'm a little person.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.311
Yeah, well,

10:01.268 --> 10:03.311
I'm talking about inside.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.980
Inside, I'm even littler.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.234
Sweetheart, by<i> big..</i>

10:09.276 --> 10:12.487
...I mean a person

10:09.276 --> 10:12.487
who's generous and forgiving.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.906
Isn't that the kind of person

10:12.529 --> 10:14.906
you wanna grow up to be?

10:17.033 --> 10:18.326
Okay.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.161
I forgive you.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.205
- Thank you, sweetheart.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.205
- Alright, Michelle.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.957
That's my big girl.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.293
Come here, now.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.293
Do me a favor, would you?

10:26.334 --> 10:29.963
Run downstairs and put

10:26.334 --> 10:29.963
the sun in the juicer, okay?

10:30.004 --> 10:32.507
I'll be down in just

10:30.004 --> 10:32.507
a minute to join you.

10:34.217 --> 10:35.927
Guys, I..

10:35.969 --> 10:38.721
I know how you feel about

10:35.969 --> 10:38.721
getting unsolicited advice.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.224
That's not gonna stop you

10:38.763 --> 10:41.224
from offering some, right?

10:41.266 --> 10:43.560
No, no, because

10:41.266 --> 10:43.560
this is important.

10:43.602 --> 10:47.188
I mean, I love Nicky and Alex

10:43.602 --> 10:47.188
but they're way out of control.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.524
Oh, come on, they're not

10:47.230 --> 10:49.524
out of control. They-they're..

10:49.566 --> 10:51.734
Alright, I admit

10:49.566 --> 10:51.734
they're a little uh..

10:51.776 --> 10:52.860
what's the word I'm looking for?

10:52.902 --> 10:53.945
- Feisty?

10:52.902 --> 10:53.945
- Feisty is a good one.

10:53.987 --> 10:54.988
They're a little feisty.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.490
I'll even give you, um..

10:56.531 --> 10:57.991
- Rambunctious.

10:56.531 --> 10:57.991
- Rambunctious. Right.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.242
But there's no way that my kids

10:59.284 --> 11:00.368
are out of control. I mean--

11:00.410 --> 11:02.120
(Joey)

11:00.410 --> 11:02.120
' Nicky, Alex, my watch!'

11:02.162 --> 11:04.205
[toilet flushes]

11:05.748 --> 11:08.502
- Jess, they're out of control.

11:05.748 --> 11:08.502
- Well, al-alright.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.170
Maybe they're a wee

11:08.543 --> 11:10.170
out of control

11:10.211 --> 11:11.796
but they're not,

11:10.211 --> 11:11.796
they're not<i> way</i> out.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.257
All I'm saying is

11:11.838 --> 11:14.257
kids need limits.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.009
Well, we set limits.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.009
I mean uh..

11:16.050 --> 11:17.552
The other day, when they

11:16.050 --> 11:17.552
got in your make-up?

11:17.594 --> 11:18.886
What did we do?

11:18.928 --> 11:20.221
Actually, we took a picture.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.889
Oh yes, it was so cute.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.889
You should see.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.391
They all had lipstick

11:21.931 --> 11:23.391
all over their faces.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.934
- We made doubles. I got--

11:23.433 --> 11:24.934
- For you.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.853
But after that

11:24.976 --> 11:26.853
we-we-we got firm.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.439
And we sat them down

11:26.894 --> 11:29.439
and we gave them a good firm..

11:29.481 --> 11:31.525
...scrubbing. 'Cause they had

11:29.481 --> 11:31.525
lipstick all over their lips.

11:31.566 --> 11:33.692
And then I got another

11:31.566 --> 11:33.692
picture and..

11:35.445 --> 11:36.946
Uh..

11:36.988 --> 11:39.240
Honey, I'm afraid Danny's right.

11:39.282 --> 11:40.408
I mean, we can't wait

11:39.282 --> 11:40.408
until the boys

11:40.450 --> 11:41.784
are knocking off liquor stores.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.370
I mean, we gotta tighten

11:41.826 --> 11:43.370
things up around here.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.246
Alright, yeah. Right, right.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.246
Tight. I got it.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.165
- I hear you guys.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.165
- Are you sure?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.376
Because you're always Mr. Softie

11:47.207 --> 11:49.376
when it comes to the boys.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.960
And-and we both have to

11:49.417 --> 11:50.960
make a commitment here.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.337
No, I'm making a commitment.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.337
You guys are right.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.297
No more Mr. Softie, okay?

11:54.339 --> 11:58.134
In fact, I'm gonna start laying

11:54.339 --> 11:58.134
down the law, right about now.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.511
What are you gonna do?

11:59.553 --> 12:01.471
First off, I'm gonna go..

12:01.513 --> 12:04.265
...fish Joey's watch

12:01.513 --> 12:04.265
out of the toilet.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.727
[instrumental music]

12:10.438 --> 12:11.648
I'm glad you're all here.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.274
What's the big secret, dad?

12:13.316 --> 12:14.901
If you called us

12:13.316 --> 12:14.901
down here to tell us

12:14.942 --> 12:16.361
that sweater's out of style

12:16.403 --> 12:18.405
we've known for three years.

12:19.614 --> 12:22.409
It has nothing to do

12:19.614 --> 12:22.409
with this sweater.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.412
Now, you all know that Vicky

12:22.450 --> 12:25.412
has been working very hard

12:25.453 --> 12:26.954
on this dinner tonight.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.457
So, if any of you happen

12:26.996 --> 12:29.457
to see anything

12:29.499 --> 12:33.044
that's you know,

12:29.499 --> 12:33.044
new and unusual on your plates

12:33.086 --> 12:34.254
taste it.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.880
Experience it.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.466
And then if you still don't

12:35.922 --> 12:38.466
like it, choke it down.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.928
Boy dad, you got

12:39.842 --> 12:41.928
our mouths watering.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.430
This could be really nasty.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.265
I hope there's enough.

12:46.474 --> 12:50.019
Dad, about that new

12:46.474 --> 12:50.019
and unusual food.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.063
I don't have a problem

12:50.061 --> 12:52.063
with the new

12:52.105 --> 12:55.233
but I have some concerns

12:52.105 --> 12:55.233
about the unusual.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.652
Does unusual mean gross?

12:59.237 --> 13:00.905
Okay.

13:00.947 --> 13:04.158
You know, how you two

13:00.947 --> 13:04.158
have been asking for advances

13:04.200 --> 13:06.536
in your allowances?

13:06.578 --> 13:09.581
Well, how does $2 sound?

13:09.623 --> 13:11.708
Not as good as 5.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.629
Okay, 5 it is.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.964
But you're gonna pay me

13:15.670 --> 13:17.964
back when you're 30.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.049
I can't believe I just did this.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.843
Okay, everyone.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.843
I hope you like it.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.763
Steph, can I give you

13:22.885 --> 13:24.763
a piece of pizza?

13:24.803 --> 13:26.847
Uh, sure.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.225
Um, what's that

13:26.889 --> 13:29.225
crumbly white stuff?

13:29.267 --> 13:31.686
Oh, that's goat cheese.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.105
What part of the goat

13:31.728 --> 13:34.105
is the cheese?

13:38.067 --> 13:40.695
Is it supposed

13:38.067 --> 13:40.695
to smell like that?

13:41.571 --> 13:44.324
Not that that's a bad smell.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.744
Oh! Don't worry, the cheese

13:44.365 --> 13:47.744
is just a little ripe.

13:47.786 --> 13:51.956
The spaghetti's not.

13:47.786 --> 13:51.956
It's still green.

13:51.998 --> 13:55.251
No, honey, that's<i> pesto</i> sauce.

13:51.998 --> 13:55.251
It's supposed to be green.

13:55.293 --> 13:58.963
Yeah, yeah. You know green,

13:55.293 --> 13:58.963
like a $5 bill?

13:59.005 --> 14:00.632
Looks great.

14:00.674 --> 14:03.134
Green's my favorite color.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.178
Good.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.555
Well, Nicky and Alex

14:05.219 --> 14:07.555
are certainly enjoying it.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.641
Some of it's actually

14:07.597 --> 14:09.641
getting into their mouths.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.768
[Jess laughs]

14:18.650 --> 14:21.194
Alex, put down that bowl!

14:25.072 --> 14:26.240
I'll take care of this.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.742
Time to lay down the law.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.869
Son, put down the bowl.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.789
[humming]

14:32.831 --> 14:34.666
Alright, you guys are

14:32.831 --> 14:34.666
ganging up on me now.

14:34.708 --> 14:35.916
No, I'm not kidding this time.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.712
Both of you guys

14:35.958 --> 14:38.712
put down the bowls.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.381
[clanking]

14:45.009 --> 14:47.094
Well, they put them down.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.265
I may be going out

14:49.681 --> 14:51.265
on a limb here, Jess.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.226
But I think they're

14:51.307 --> 14:53.226
testing you.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.186
Danny's right. You gotta

14:53.267 --> 14:55.186
be tough. Don't waffle.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.188
That's right, okay.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.188
Alright listen guys.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.690
Now, you guys are

14:57.230 --> 14:58.690
in trouble, okay?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.859
You know what happens next?

15:00.900 --> 15:03.236
Beck, what happens next?

15:03.277 --> 15:05.071
Uh, I think the boys

15:03.277 --> 15:05.071
should get a time-out.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.823
Time-out. That's right.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.823
Time out for the both of you.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.825
That's good, okay,

15:06.865 --> 15:08.825
you guys are gonna go upstairs

15:08.867 --> 15:10.951
and you're gonna sit there

15:08.867 --> 15:10.951
until it's time to come out.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.663
Uh, hence the term, "time-out."

15:13.705 --> 15:15.998
And, Jess. No dessert.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.710
Why? I was tough.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.710
I didn't waffle.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.295
- Not you. The boys!

15:18.752 --> 15:21.295
- 'Oh, that's right.'

15:21.337 --> 15:23.256
Come on, guys. Let's go.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.466
Come on. Upstairs.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.847
Sorry, everyone.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.140
Hey, come on, Beck,

15:30.889 --> 15:33.140
this stuff happens all the time.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.727
I mean who amongst us

15:33.182 --> 15:35.727
hasn't splattered bean dip

15:35.769 --> 15:37.854
all over their headboard, huh?

15:40.690 --> 15:43.192
Pass me the bread, please.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.278
Okay, everybody, let's get back

15:43.234 --> 15:45.278
to this<i> fabulous</i> meal

15:45.319 --> 15:46.696
that Vicky made for us.

15:46.738 --> 15:48.155
Hey, everything's really good.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.784
Yeah, it's fantastic.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.118
Do you like it, Michelle?

15:52.159 --> 15:53.994
I love it.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.456
Wouldn't you like

15:54.036 --> 15:56.456
to taste it first?

15:56.497 --> 15:58.249
Oh. Right.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.849
That<i> is</i> good.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.352
Michelle, you're missing

16:15.975 --> 16:18.352
the best part.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.104
Here you go.

16:23.566 --> 16:25.025
Well, uh, everyone eat up.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.446
There's plenty more

16:25.067 --> 16:28.446
where this came from.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.657
Where<i> did</i> it come from?

16:32.533 --> 16:35.536
Okay, there you go. Guys, I'm

16:32.533 --> 16:35.536
not doing this to be mean.

16:35.578 --> 16:36.871
It's just that uh..

16:36.913 --> 16:38.080
Hey, you kinda backed me

16:36.913 --> 16:38.080
in a corner

16:38.122 --> 16:39.081
down there in front of everybody

16:39.123 --> 16:40.416
with that pasta incident.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.001
I mean, you don't want

16:40.458 --> 16:42.001
your old man

16:42.042 --> 16:43.377
looking like a weenie, do you?

16:43.419 --> 16:45.588
- Weenie.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.966
No, come on guys, this is no

16:45.630 --> 16:47.966
joke. Sit down son, please.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.217
Put the chair down. Now,

16:48.007 --> 16:50.217
sit down. This isn't a joke.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.845
Look, we're all

16:50.259 --> 16:51.845
on the same team here.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.262
Let's just do this

16:51.886 --> 16:53.262
time-out thing

16:53.304 --> 16:54.472
and we'll get it

16:53.304 --> 16:54.472
over with, okay?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.599
[blowing a raspberry]

16:58.518 --> 16:59.853
You know what? Now,

16:58.518 --> 16:59.853
you've pushed me too far.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.562
You know, I'm trying

16:59.894 --> 17:01.562
to be a nice guy.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.356
Nicky, Alex, you keep

17:01.604 --> 17:03.356
those little butts in those

17:03.397 --> 17:05.692
chairs and you do not move

17:03.397 --> 17:05.692
a muscle until I say it's okay.

17:05.733 --> 17:06.901
Do you understand me?

17:06.943 --> 17:10.488
- Mean daddy.

17:06.943 --> 17:10.488
- 'Mean guy.'

17:10.530 --> 17:12.573
Mean daddy.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.035
Mean daddy?

17:16.076 --> 17:18.287
'Mean daddy.'

17:20.122 --> 17:23.001
So, Steph, what do you think

17:20.122 --> 17:23.001
of goat cheese now?

17:23.042 --> 17:25.628
Good food. Bad name.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.254
(Steve)

17:25.670 --> 17:27.254
'You know,

17:25.670 --> 17:27.254
I learned something today.'

17:27.296 --> 17:29.757
If it comes out of a goat,

17:27.296 --> 17:29.757
I'm eating it.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.220
Well, what I hope

17:32.552 --> 17:34.220
Steve means is

17:34.261 --> 17:36.597
this is one of the greatest

17:34.261 --> 17:36.597
meals we've ever had.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.766
- That's the truth.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.766
- Wonderful.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.184
Yeah, it's really good.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.102
[indistinct chattering]

17:42.144 --> 17:45.398
Girls, girls, you can take it

17:42.144 --> 17:45.398
down to about a four, okay?

17:45.439 --> 17:47.066
No daddy, it really is great.

17:47.107 --> 17:50.444
I'd eat it even if

17:47.107 --> 17:50.444
you didn't pay us.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.240
Danny?

17:54.281 --> 17:55.783
Did you pay these

17:54.281 --> 17:55.783
children to pretend

17:55.825 --> 17:57.827
they like my cooking?

17:59.370 --> 18:01.414
Well, not all of them.

18:02.373 --> 18:04.208
Yeah. What a rip-off.

18:05.877 --> 18:08.337
Why would you do that?

18:08.379 --> 18:11.215
Look, Vicky, I know

18:08.379 --> 18:11.215
how finicky the girls can be

18:11.257 --> 18:13.634
and I didn't want them

18:11.257 --> 18:13.634
to hurt your feelings.

18:13.676 --> 18:14.844
I'm sorry.

18:14.886 --> 18:15.887
I should have had more faith

18:15.929 --> 18:18.514
in you and your goat cheese.

18:18.556 --> 18:19.849
Yes, you should have.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.350
But because you did it

18:19.891 --> 18:21.350
out of caring

18:21.392 --> 18:23.394
I'm going to forgive you.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.396
Oh, thanks.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.357
Right<i> after</i> you do the dishes.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.611
Oh!

18:31.652 --> 18:35.073
Excuse me. Some of us are

18:31.652 --> 18:35.073
trying to keep our dinner down.

18:37.491 --> 18:38.868
Okay, time for dessert.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.954
Vanilla ice cream

18:38.910 --> 18:40.954
with chocolate syrup.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.539
- 'Alright.'

18:40.995 --> 18:43.539
- Sounds good.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.417
- 'I love chocolate chip.'

18:43.581 --> 18:46.417
- 'Ah, man! Ice cream!'

18:46.459 --> 18:47.752
(Becky)

18:46.459 --> 18:47.752
'How did it go?'

18:47.794 --> 18:49.545
Oh, fine. Good.

18:49.587 --> 18:50.755
There were no tears.

18:50.797 --> 18:51.965
And, uh..

18:52.006 --> 18:54.926
...the boys took it

18:52.006 --> 18:54.926
pretty well too.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.595
Well, maybe this will

18:54.968 --> 18:57.595
make you feel better.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.056
Um, there's an extra two.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.558
They were for Nicky and Alex.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.685
(all)

19:02.600 --> 19:04.685
Aw.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.854
What? A guy tries to set

19:04.727 --> 19:06.854
a couple of limits and--

19:06.896 --> 19:08.064
Honey, you did

19:06.896 --> 19:08.064
the right thing.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.441
Well, tell them to stop

19:08.106 --> 19:10.441
"awing" at me.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.361
(D.J.)

19:12.777 --> 19:14.361
'But I love dessert soufflé.'

19:14.403 --> 19:16.447

[instrumental music]

19:49.480 --> 19:51.816
Boys.

(Becky)

19:51.858 --> 19:54.152
'Jess?'

19:54.193 --> 19:55.402
'Jess?'

19:58.614 --> 19:59.949
Are-are you okay?

19:59.991 --> 20:02.535
You just seemed

19:59.991 --> 20:02.535
a little upset downstairs.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.787
Upset? Me?

20:04.829 --> 20:07.165
No. I'm fine.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.043
I'm cold, cool-cool.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.043
Everything's, uh..

20:10.084 --> 20:12.837
...very cool.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.506
Well look, I know it was really

20:12.879 --> 20:15.506
hard for you to punish the boys.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.926
And I just, I wanted to say

20:15.548 --> 20:18.926
thank you for being so strong.

20:20.678 --> 20:23.639
And so cold.

20:23.681 --> 20:25.349
- Jess.

20:23.681 --> 20:25.349
- I am kind of cold..

20:25.391 --> 20:26.642
What?

20:26.684 --> 20:28.728
What are these?

20:28.769 --> 20:31.397
How did those get in my shirt?

20:28.769 --> 20:31.397
Who inspected this shirt?

20:33.232 --> 20:35.234
Aha! Number 19.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.234
I'm writing a letter.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.738
You were sneaking ice cream

20:36.485 --> 20:38.738
up to the boys.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.573
I thought we agreed

20:38.779 --> 20:40.573
to be tough.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.282
Well, they didn't call you

20:40.614 --> 20:42.282
"mean daddy".

20:42.324 --> 20:45.244
Oh, honey.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.244
They're just angry.

20:45.285 --> 20:48.664
It's perfectly natural.

20:45.285 --> 20:48.664
They're just words.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.918
They didn't happen to mention

20:48.706 --> 20:51.918
"mean mommy", did they?

20:51.959 --> 20:55.004
I distinctively heard

20:51.959 --> 20:55.004
"mean daddy."

20:55.046 --> 20:58.049
Oh, Beck, I never pictured

20:55.046 --> 20:58.049
myself as the kind of father

20:58.091 --> 20:59.550
that would come down

20:58.091 --> 20:59.550
so hard on my kids.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.468
I mean, I always swore

20:59.592 --> 21:01.468
if I had kids

21:01.510 --> 21:04.263
I'd be like their friend,

21:01.510 --> 21:04.263
you know, their pal.

21:04.304 --> 21:07.307
Hmm. And their mother could

21:04.304 --> 21:07.307
handle the discipline.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.977
Great. Would you?

21:10.019 --> 21:12.855
Honey, why is this

21:10.019 --> 21:12.855
so hard for you?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.442
Oh, Beck, it happened.

21:16.483 --> 21:19.486
I swore it would never happen

21:16.483 --> 21:19.486
and it happened.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.906
What happened?

21:21.948 --> 21:24.200
I turned into my father.

21:24.242 --> 21:26.035
Oh, Beck, you should have heard

21:24.242 --> 21:26.035
me yelling at the boys.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.828
It was, it was,

21:26.077 --> 21:27.828
everything came back.

21:27.870 --> 21:28.996
I sounded just like my dad.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.414
"Sit in those seats

21:29.038 --> 21:30.414
and don't move

21:30.456 --> 21:32.291
a muscle until I say."

21:32.332 --> 21:33.918
I hated it when he did that.

21:33.960 --> 21:37.379
Why did dads have

21:33.960 --> 21:37.379
to be that way?

21:37.421 --> 21:40.299
Maybe because they're human.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.053
Maybe because

21:41.467 --> 21:44.053
they're frustrated.

21:44.095 --> 21:48.307
Maybe they just want

21:44.095 --> 21:48.307
what's best for their kids.

21:48.348 --> 21:51.351
And you know, your dad

21:48.348 --> 21:51.351
didn't do such a bad job.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.272
You turned out pretty good.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.233
Well, I was blessed

21:54.313 --> 21:57.233
in the hair area.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.989
Man, Ward Cleaver

22:00.611 --> 22:02.989
made it look so easy.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.199
Well, June was

22:03.030 --> 22:05.199
no slouch either.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.409
Should we spring 'em?

22:07.451 --> 22:09.078
Please.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.000
Wally? Beav?

22:14.041 --> 22:15.084
Time-out's over.

22:15.126 --> 22:17.336
[clanking]

22:17.377 --> 22:20.256
See, Beck, they wish

22:17.377 --> 22:20.256
that was my head.

22:20.298 --> 22:22.008
They do not.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.425
Alright, boys.

22:23.467 --> 22:26.053
You know what?

22:23.467 --> 22:26.053
It's time for your baths.

22:26.095 --> 22:29.140
And then we're gonna

22:26.095 --> 22:29.140
get you ready for bed.

22:29.182 --> 22:32.852
And tonight, you're going

22:29.182 --> 22:32.852
to sleep in your own beds.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.604
- Big bed.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.604
- Go big bed.

22:36.563 --> 22:37.815
No. Big bed.
