01:22.500 --> 01:26.003
So beautiful.

01:26.921 --> 01:28.631
What's that?

01:28.881 --> 01:33.761
-Did you feel something?
-Yeah, I feel something.

01:35.054 --> 01:38.724
Hey, get back here!

01:40.226 --> 01:43.437
Turn up the music!

01:45.814 --> 01:48.192
We're having a party, man.

01:48.442 --> 01:53.155
You guys are having fun. Boat's rocking.

01:57.993 --> 01:58.952
Stop!

01:59.203 --> 02:02.831
-You're paranoid!
-Listen.

02:08.627 --> 02:11.423
Did you hear that?

02:11.673 --> 02:14.634
Listen, listen.

02:24.644 --> 02:28.356
-You hear that?
-What is that?

02:34.946 --> 02:37.949
Everybody, shh!

02:38.616 --> 02:41.744
Stay up there.

02:51.253 --> 02:54.173
What is that?

03:19.656 --> 03:22.492
Come on!

04:20.841 --> 04:24.636
Okay, we've had some problems
at the facility.

04:24.887 --> 04:28.015
What we're attempting to achieve
has never been done.

04:28.265 --> 04:32.269
We're this close to the reactivation
of a human brain cell.

04:32.519 --> 04:33.437
Doctor...

04:33.687 --> 04:37.733
...the $200 million I sunk into this company
is due in great part to your research.

04:37.983 --> 04:39.776
But when the market opens Monday...

04:40.026 --> 04:42.779
...despite my reputation,
I don't like heights.

04:43.029 --> 04:45.824
Especially falling from them.

04:46.074 --> 04:49.452
I'm sorry, honestly.

04:59.420 --> 05:04.759
Tell me, Mr. Franklin, have you ever known
anyone with Alzheimer's?

05:05.009 --> 05:08.304
Well, no.

05:08.554 --> 05:13.142
By the end, all my father could do
was ask why my mother wasn't at home.

05:13.392 --> 05:17.688
Each time I said she was dead,
I saw him take the loss like a car wreck.

05:17.938 --> 05:22.818
200,000 men and women
develop Alzheimer's each year.

05:22.943 --> 05:27.823
What if you could end all that suffering
with a single pill?

05:29.450 --> 05:31.744
Give me till Monday morning. 48 hours.

05:31.994 --> 05:34.580
I'll give you results
that'll skyrocket your stock price...

05:34.830 --> 05:37.040
...or I'll help you pack the lab myself.

05:37.291 --> 05:40.461
It's your call.

05:54.266 --> 05:58.645
That was an impressive speech
you gave back there.

05:59.187 --> 06:01.523
I read that article on you.

06:01.773 --> 06:04.693
-The thing in the Himalayas.
-Alps.

06:04.943 --> 06:07.362
Right.

06:07.612 --> 06:11.783
We were just trying
to do something together.

06:12.033 --> 06:14.160
Having fun.

06:14.410 --> 06:16.955
Things went bad.

06:17.205 --> 06:19.082
But you saved all those people.

06:19.332 --> 06:22.168
Not all.

06:36.390 --> 06:39.268
Navy built it for WWII submarine loading...

06:39.518 --> 06:41.395
...refueling.

06:41.645 --> 06:47.359
When they mothballed it, we picked it up,
added aquatic pens, underwater labs.

06:47.609 --> 06:50.946
Your dime, I guess.

06:52.072 --> 06:55.826
Looks like Alcatraz floats.

07:27.273 --> 07:30.360
What do you think? She's a 12-footer.
She's beautiful.

07:30.610 --> 07:32.779
-She wants to give you a big kiss.
-I bet.

07:33.029 --> 07:35.239
She's got a license plate
jammed in her mouth.

07:35.490 --> 07:37.825
It's a good deal, "amigo".

07:38.075 --> 07:41.078
Drop her, Billy!

07:53.507 --> 07:55.926
Russell Franklin, Janice Higgins.

07:56.177 --> 07:57.720
Marine biologist.

07:57.970 --> 08:01.557
Jan will get you settled.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.059
Welcome to our island paradise.

08:04.309 --> 08:05.769
Where's Tattoo?

08:06.019 --> 08:08.689
You know, short guy?

08:08.939 --> 08:11.608
"The plane, Boss! The plane!"

08:11.859 --> 08:14.069
Right.

08:14.319 --> 08:16.738
I am getting old.

08:16.989 --> 08:18.865
How much do you know about our facility?

08:19.116 --> 08:20.450
Treat me like a tourist.

08:20.700 --> 08:25.330
I hate tourists and I've decided
I'm going to like you.

09:42.030 --> 09:44.699
"Louisiana."

09:44.950 --> 09:47.619
I think he was bought in a pet shop
in Baton Rouge.

09:47.869 --> 09:51.247
Ate everything in his tank,
and then ate the guy that bought him.

09:51.498 --> 09:56.544
Next day, fills up the cab of the guy's truck
with water and drives to Baja...

09:56.794 --> 10:01.507
...picking bones out of his teeth
with the license plate.

10:01.966 --> 10:04.927
We need to talk.

10:04.927 --> 10:07.555
Later.

10:07.597 --> 10:14.020
Carter Blake, Russell Franklin,
president of Chimera Pharmaceuticals.

10:14.395 --> 10:17.273
That was incredible.

10:17.523 --> 10:21.944
Actually, they don't like the taste
of us very much.

10:23.821 --> 10:29.243
If they bite you, it's because
they think you're a fat little seal.

10:29.743 --> 10:32.663
Or a rich suit.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.711
Nice meeting you.

10:41.713 --> 10:43.006
Friendly place.

10:43.256 --> 10:48.011
You got full sentences.
Usually, he just kind of nods.

10:48.261 --> 10:52.933
Word travels fast
about why you're here and all.

10:53.183 --> 10:54.809
Was that the Gen 1 that escaped?

10:55.060 --> 10:58.772
That little guy? No way.
Those are the normals.

10:59.022 --> 11:02.484
These three are the test sharks.

11:04.569 --> 11:09.824
Two first-generation
and one second-generation female.

11:14.871 --> 11:17.582
Beneath its glassy surface...

11:17.832 --> 11:21.461
...a world of gliding monsters.

11:24.380 --> 11:27.383
It's pretty scary stuff, huh?

11:27.633 --> 11:30.678
Yes. It is.

11:30.928 --> 11:34.181
Tower to water taxi.

11:34.432 --> 11:37.935
Ben, I'm picking up a nasty little bitch
of a squall about 30 miles out.

11:38.185 --> 11:39.019
Over.

11:39.270 --> 11:42.731
Copy that. We'll be all right.

11:48.695 --> 11:51.115
Jan, stay out of the rain.

11:51.365 --> 11:53.534
Where are they going? They hate me too?

11:53.784 --> 11:58.038
They're going home.
We run a skeleton crew on the weekend.

11:58.288 --> 12:01.541
But they probably hate you anyway.

12:01.792 --> 12:06.296
There's Dr. Jim Whitlock,
the most brilliant man ever.

12:06.546 --> 12:09.716
He's pissing into the wind.
How brilliant can he be?

12:09.966 --> 12:12.969
You'll see.

12:25.106 --> 12:27.442
What happened, deadeye?
You miss with the first shot?

12:27.692 --> 12:29.485
It took two hits to even slow it down.

12:29.736 --> 12:32.530
Are you kidding?
Two of these should've almost killed it.

12:32.780 --> 12:34.031
Go tell it that, Scoggs.

12:34.282 --> 12:37.910
You missed. Don't get mad at me
because you can't shoot worth a shit.

12:38.160 --> 12:41.205
If you hadn't left the pen open,
I could've had a good sleep.

12:41.455 --> 12:44.333
I already told the doc,
I locked the pen like I do every night.

12:44.583 --> 12:47.461
The fish got out some other way.

12:47.711 --> 12:50.339
What are you looking at me like that for?

12:50.589 --> 12:52.174
Who are you going to trust?

12:52.424 --> 12:55.135
Me, that's who. You trust me.

12:55.386 --> 13:00.015
You know why? Because I'm trustworthy.

13:04.103 --> 13:08.190
How high are these fences off the water?

13:08.232 --> 13:12.235
Given the surface variations
and tensile strength--

13:12.486 --> 13:14.821
Short answer, man.

13:15.072 --> 13:19.117
Eight feet, give or take a centimeter.

13:24.456 --> 13:27.709
I'm sorry. I'm making Aquatica sound
like a mental hospital.

13:27.959 --> 13:29.336
No, not really.

13:29.586 --> 13:31.671
Well, maybe a little.

13:31.921 --> 13:34.799
The truth is, it is.

13:35.049 --> 13:37.886
But almost everyone here is top
of their game.

13:38.136 --> 13:42.849
Living below is like living in space.
You don't get very many mistakes.

13:43.099 --> 13:44.642
Besides the catwalks...

13:44.892 --> 13:49.063
...you bought us titanium-based fencing
around all the lagoon and pens.

13:49.313 --> 13:52.233
There are three sub-levels.
Sub-level One is living quarters.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.485
Two: Wet lab and workshops.

13:54.735 --> 13:59.448
And Three: Engineering
and air-locked wet entry.

14:04.370 --> 14:07.623
Welcome to Aquatica.

14:41.615 --> 14:43.533
Did you dose the Gen 2 with the serum?

14:43.783 --> 14:48.288
I had Carter do it as soon as you called.
It should be ready tomorrow night.

14:48.538 --> 14:51.541
-But?
-We will not be ready.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.585
Two months ahead of schedule.

14:53.835 --> 14:56.879
We're skipping three rounds
of preliminary trials.

14:57.130 --> 15:00.049
No choice.

15:02.844 --> 15:06.806
You wait your whole life
for a single moment...

15:07.056 --> 15:11.060
...and then one day, it's tomorrow.

15:17.858 --> 15:22.154
So what exactly does a shark wrangler do?

15:22.404 --> 15:25.157
Pretty much what it sounds like, I guess.

15:25.407 --> 15:27.660
How'd you end up here at Aquatica?

15:27.910 --> 15:29.411
I like the water.

15:29.661 --> 15:32.623
Pay is good.

15:34.583 --> 15:41.423
An AGA mask! Did some wreck diving
in one of these, off the coast of Spain.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.342
Tourist thing.

15:44.593 --> 15:48.513
Do you like wreck diving?

15:49.764 --> 15:51.433
It's okay.

15:51.683 --> 15:55.061
I bet you're really good at it.

15:55.312 --> 16:01.359
We're on the water.
Whole cat-and-mouse thing don't float.

16:02.819 --> 16:06.072
You're the man, right?

16:06.948 --> 16:10.159
Yeah, I'm the man.

16:10.243 --> 16:13.121
The man's always got a file. What's it say?

16:13.371 --> 16:17.667
Two years, Leavenworth. Smuggling.

16:18.751 --> 16:20.253
How'd you make your money?

16:20.503 --> 16:24.215
You the first rich guy in history
who's squeaky-clean?

16:24.465 --> 16:27.802
You do understand my concern, right?

16:28.052 --> 16:31.013
Look, I got a workable deal here.

16:31.263 --> 16:32.723
I don't make waves.

16:32.973 --> 16:35.392
I meet the terms of my parole.

16:35.643 --> 16:39.104
I'm not out to change the world,
like the doc.

16:39.355 --> 16:43.192
I'm not out to wreck it either.

16:52.492 --> 16:55.829
Eat me, asshole!

16:57.372 --> 17:00.709
Hey, you dickhead!

17:05.255 --> 17:06.506
Fat butt!

17:06.756 --> 17:08.967
You got a big, fat butt.

17:09.217 --> 17:10.385
You know what, bird?

17:10.635 --> 17:13.930
You're trying my last nerve.
Don't make me drown your feathery ass.

17:14.180 --> 17:15.807
Get myself a cat.

17:16.057 --> 17:20.561
That's good. Yes. That's good.

17:22.021 --> 17:23.439
That's it.

17:23.690 --> 17:27.944
You got a nasty-looking tongue,
you know that?

17:32.198 --> 17:35.409
Feeding time.

17:42.666 --> 17:45.795
I'm releasing the tiger shark
in 30 seconds. Copy?

17:46.045 --> 17:49.673
I hear you. I'm going in.

17:50.424 --> 17:53.636
You guys hungry?

18:31.464 --> 18:33.716
Dr. McAlester, we have a situation up here.

18:33.967 --> 18:37.720
Could you please come to surface level?

18:37.971 --> 18:43.393
Dr. McAlester, could you come
to surf ace level, please?

19:22.806 --> 19:24.808
Surprise!

19:25.058 --> 19:28.895
Happy birthday!

19:32.315 --> 19:34.943
Damn, I hate that song.

19:35.193 --> 19:39.280
You like the tunes there, Preach?

19:41.616 --> 19:46.079
Carter, join us. There's too much woman
on this deck for Scoggs to handle.

19:46.329 --> 19:48.665
Vodka, straight.

19:48.915 --> 19:54.587
And by the way,
food was excellent, brother.

19:55.672 --> 19:59.050
You're that guy that got caught
in that avalanche, right?

19:59.300 --> 20:00.218
I'm the one.

20:00.468 --> 20:02.386
Black men have enough ways
to get killed...

20:02.637 --> 20:06.015
...without climbing up some mountain
in the middle of nowhere.

20:06.265 --> 20:11.020
You need to leave that
to the white folks, "brother."

20:16.358 --> 20:19.028
Happy birthday?

20:19.278 --> 20:22.781
I'll let you know tomorrow.

20:22.906 --> 20:24.616
How's life underwater?

20:24.867 --> 20:28.412
It's a lot less complicated...

20:28.662 --> 20:30.956
...than it is on the surface.

20:31.206 --> 20:33.584
That's for sure.

20:33.834 --> 20:36.295
Nice work with that new tiger shark today.

20:36.545 --> 20:39.089
One day, you'll have to tell me
how you learned that.

20:39.339 --> 20:43.552
One day, you'll take me up
on that beer and maybe I will.

20:43.802 --> 20:46.388
It's all work for me, Carter.

20:46.638 --> 20:49.516
But, like you said, "One day."

20:49.766 --> 20:55.063
Sharks never get cancer, go blind
or show loss of brain activity as they age.

20:55.313 --> 20:57.857
Unlike some people I know.

20:58.108 --> 21:01.027
Sharks are the oldest creatures
on the planet...

21:01.277 --> 21:07.075
...from a time when the world
was just flesh and teeth.

21:07.325 --> 21:08.743
By using a hormonal enhancer...

21:08.993 --> 21:12.997
...we increased this female's forebrain
to five times its normal size.

21:13.247 --> 21:14.665
To harvest more protein.

21:14.916 --> 21:17.168
Exactly. A protein that may reactivate--

21:17.418 --> 21:18.794
That will....

21:19.045 --> 21:23.841
...that will reactivate human brain cells
stored in the forebrain of the shark.

21:24.091 --> 21:28.929
I'm just amazed that we've come so far,
so fast, without genetic tampering.

21:29.180 --> 21:33.809
Genetic engineering to increase brain mass
violates the Harvard Genetics Compact.

21:34.059 --> 21:38.230
Not to mention Chimera policy.

21:38.272 --> 21:41.108
They're hunting in packs.

21:41.358 --> 21:44.736
Like wild dogs.

21:44.862 --> 21:47.197
They'll only eat other sharks.

21:47.447 --> 21:50.409
You're reading too much into it.

21:50.659 --> 21:55.038
That Gen 1 attacked a 25-foot boat.

21:55.956 --> 21:59.584
Am I reading too much into that too?

21:59.835 --> 22:03.296
Did you tell Franklin?

22:03.463 --> 22:05.590
I'm just a fish keeper, lady.

22:05.840 --> 22:11.179
But bringing in that shark
ahead of schedule was a very bad idea.

22:12.680 --> 22:16.184
Do you like your job?

22:18.311 --> 22:21.105
Are you threatening me, Doc?

22:21.356 --> 22:23.524
No.

22:23.775 --> 22:29.489
But if we don't pull off that test tomorrow,
we're all on the street.

22:30.323 --> 22:33.618
You're a good man, Carter.

22:33.868 --> 22:37.413
But with your background....

22:41.959 --> 22:44.795
Right.

23:02.521 --> 23:05.148
How's Miss Smarty-Pants?

23:05.399 --> 23:08.443
Hope she's not as dumb as she seems.

23:08.694 --> 23:11.071
Raise those fences like I asked?

23:11.321 --> 23:15.867
I took care of it. Let's go get a beer.

23:23.833 --> 23:25.668
US Coast Guard advisories include:

23:25.919 --> 23:30.590
All-craft warnings for waters south
of the US mainland and west of CA.

23:30.840 --> 23:33.676
A tropical depression is generating
gale-force winds...

23:33.927 --> 23:39.474
...and is associated with heavy rains
and ocean swells to 30 feet or more.

23:46.355 --> 23:50.484
Any of your nonsense, and we'll have
tiny drumsticks on the menu tonight.

23:50.735 --> 23:53.237
Fat butt!

23:53.487 --> 23:54.155
That's right.

23:54.405 --> 23:57.992
You can...all you want.

24:46.456 --> 24:50.501
Welcome to my parlor, Mr. Franklin.

24:55.673 --> 24:58.259
Wow.

24:59.802 --> 25:03.264
Wet lab, we're taking a pounding up here.
Can't see past my nose.

25:03.514 --> 25:06.434
So I suggest you check pen monitors
and lagoon monitors.

25:06.684 --> 25:08.728
I can't imagine
there's much visibility below.

25:08.978 --> 25:12.148
Carter, you copy?

25:14.441 --> 25:17.069
Okay, I'm approaching the tunnel.

25:17.319 --> 25:19.822
Bingo. Elvis has left the building.

25:20.072 --> 25:22.950
We picked you up,
but visibility's near zero.

25:23.200 --> 25:26.411
No problem.

26:08.578 --> 26:12.957
How long have they been synchronized
like this?

26:18.004 --> 26:21.590
Tell me I didn't see that.

26:23.926 --> 26:25.344
They recognized that gun!

26:25.594 --> 26:28.722
That's impossible.
Sharks can't swim backwards!

26:28.973 --> 26:32.601
-Try to stay focused.
-What was that?

26:36.814 --> 26:39.108
We lost picture in Gen 2 pen.

26:39.358 --> 26:42.528
Okay, hold on.

27:19.647 --> 27:23.234
Carter, do you copy?

27:24.819 --> 27:28.156
Carter, do you copy?

27:36.288 --> 27:40.626
Carter, talk to me, man. Do you copy?

27:44.380 --> 27:48.467
Cut the crap! You're scaring everybody.

28:12.240 --> 28:16.995
Boarding platform engaged. He's got her.

28:31.342 --> 28:34.637
Did someone order the fish?

29:00.537 --> 29:04.708
What in God's creation?

29:04.917 --> 29:08.003
No, not His.

29:08.170 --> 29:11.215
Ours.

29:21.975 --> 29:25.020
Commencing scan.

29:26.313 --> 29:29.983
Gen 2 is online.
Transferring exotics to remote terminals.

29:30.233 --> 29:32.277
Vital signs to Terminal 1.

29:32.527 --> 29:36.656
Diagnostic imaging to Terminal 2.

29:51.421 --> 29:53.047
We're live and in color!

29:53.297 --> 29:55.299
BP, 67 over 43.

29:55.550 --> 29:57.260
Heart rate, 50 BPM.

29:57.510 --> 30:00.346
Within norm.

30:07.937 --> 30:11.440
She's sleeping like a baby.

30:36.798 --> 30:39.801
Bad dream?

30:58.361 --> 30:59.862
In position.

31:00.113 --> 31:03.366
Vitals are stable.

31:39.359 --> 31:41.987
Vitals?

31:42.237 --> 31:42.863
Holding.

31:43.113 --> 31:47.492
Aspirating 4.5 cc.

32:23.361 --> 32:26.572
Introducing 2 cc of the protein complex...

32:26.822 --> 32:32.662
...into cultured, inactive brain neurons
of an Alzheimer's patient.

32:38.709 --> 32:43.881
And what you're looking for here
is lightning in a bottle.

32:48.552 --> 32:53.474
Protein complex is interacting
with the neurons.

32:57.811 --> 33:01.732
Neurons are becoming hyperosmotic.

33:04.818 --> 33:08.446
Membrane integrity's improving.

33:11.491 --> 33:13.034
They're firing!

33:13.285 --> 33:14.869
-They're firing!
-One second.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.329
Two. Three.

33:16.579 --> 33:19.833
-Still firing.
-Four. Five. Six.

33:20.083 --> 33:23.002
6.560 seconds.

33:23.253 --> 33:24.587
I'll be damned.

33:24.838 --> 33:27.507
No, sir. For 6.560 seconds...

33:27.757 --> 33:31.678
...you saw what it's like not to be damned.

33:31.928 --> 33:34.889
Congratulations.

33:38.476 --> 33:40.061
-Impressed?
-Overly impressed.

33:40.311 --> 33:43.564
6.560 seconds.

33:43.648 --> 33:45.149
Now that you've got this...

33:45.399 --> 33:48.235
...how long before you make
something permanent?

33:48.486 --> 33:50.988
You did it, pal.

33:51.238 --> 33:54.116
You did it.

34:00.789 --> 34:03.459
No!

34:23.812 --> 34:27.065
Carter, no!

34:42.246 --> 34:45.291
Are you insane?

34:50.420 --> 34:53.216
Tower, we need paramedics and evac now!

34:53.466 --> 34:55.134
All frequencies, SOS.

34:55.384 --> 34:59.764
This is Research Station Aquatica.
We have a medical emergency. I repeat:

35:00.014 --> 35:04.018
This is Research Station Aquatica.
We have a medical emergency.

35:04.268 --> 35:07.229
Please respond.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.236
X-ray Alpha 2-18.

35:14.486 --> 35:18.115
Coming off oil platform Chiapa.

35:18.866 --> 35:21.452
We'll take that post you've always wanted.

35:21.702 --> 35:24.496
Got it.

35:25.497 --> 35:26.748
He's hemorrhaging!

35:26.999 --> 35:31.962
They say the yellow butterflies are thick
as clouds there, remember?

35:32.921 --> 35:36.174
Research Station Aquatica,
this is X-ray Alpha 2-18.

35:36.424 --> 35:39.761
Have you in sight. Approaching from 0-6-0.

35:40.011 --> 35:41.513
Copy, 2-18.

35:41.763 --> 35:45.266
Stay with him. Keep talking.

35:46.851 --> 35:49.604
Let's move!

35:52.315 --> 35:57.487
-I'm not this kind of doctor.
-Just keep doing what you're doing.

36:05.661 --> 36:08.122
Where's the chopper? Tower?

36:08.372 --> 36:12.209
Come on, Brenda. Where's my chopper?

36:22.261 --> 36:25.889
Franklin, this end!

36:41.780 --> 36:44.908
Keep it coming!

36:44.908 --> 36:49.079
Ready. It's all right, honey. Hold on.

36:51.456 --> 36:53.124
Got it. Okay, move him out.

36:53.375 --> 36:56.253
Let's go!

37:07.931 --> 37:11.267
I love you!

37:28.701 --> 37:32.037
-Come on!
-Get up! Come on!

37:41.255 --> 37:44.258
Come on, Carter!

38:27.467 --> 38:31.095
Pull up, 2-18! Pull up!

38:48.112 --> 38:49.905
Damn! I can't get a picture.

38:50.156 --> 38:52.449
Tower, have you got a visual? Copy.

38:52.700 --> 38:55.536
I can't get anything.

38:58.747 --> 39:00.165
-Do you copy?
-Going to back-up.

39:00.416 --> 39:03.043
Got it!

40:10.067 --> 40:13.612
I'm going to take this as a sign.

40:24.039 --> 40:25.707
Where is he now?

40:25.958 --> 40:28.627
Where is he?

40:28.877 --> 40:32.839
-The whole system's shut down.
-Brenda?

40:33.089 --> 40:34.049
Are you there?

40:34.299 --> 40:37.344
This thing is dead.

40:37.510 --> 40:39.763
Somebody, please...

40:40.013 --> 40:41.931
...tell me what that is.

40:42.182 --> 40:44.976
Please.

41:27.851 --> 41:30.896
All right, people, let's move.

41:31.146 --> 41:33.148
Now!

41:33.398 --> 41:35.317
Get to the door!

41:35.567 --> 41:39.237
Come on. You can't help him.

42:23.656 --> 42:27.034
-The door frame is bent.
-Open.

42:31.080 --> 42:33.791
Open it!

42:54.811 --> 42:56.897
Turn it! Turn it!

42:57.147 --> 42:59.983
No!

43:07.782 --> 43:11.119
Tower, can you hear me?

43:11.494 --> 43:14.664
Anyone, hello?

43:25.675 --> 43:28.302
We got to get topside, find some help.

43:28.553 --> 43:29.345
What?

43:29.595 --> 43:31.389
We're flooded.

43:31.639 --> 43:34.267
Shit!

43:35.309 --> 43:37.895
There's no other stairway from this level.

43:38.145 --> 43:39.146
Elevator?

43:39.397 --> 43:43.192
It seals off automatically
to keep the shaft from filling.

43:43.442 --> 43:46.487
There's no way up.

44:15.265 --> 44:17.976
All right. Okay.

44:18.226 --> 44:22.314
If this is a lesson about the drinking,
let's just say I've learned it.

44:22.564 --> 44:25.692
No need to get carried away,
showing me your vengeful side.

44:25.942 --> 44:28.361
I know Your wrath, Lord.

44:28.611 --> 44:30.029
If Corridor B is dry...

44:30.280 --> 44:34.576
...we go back to the maintenance ladder,
climb down to Level 3.

44:34.826 --> 44:36.160
We get to the wet entry.

44:36.411 --> 44:41.833
We take the sub topside, two at a time.
We go down to get up.

44:42.583 --> 44:46.295
All right, let's move. Come on.

45:44.394 --> 45:45.728
Sounds like somebody made it.

45:45.979 --> 45:50.066
Over here! We're over here!

45:53.778 --> 45:56.739
Preach?

46:01.702 --> 46:02.828
What the hell is that?

46:03.079 --> 46:04.830
Lab equipment maybe, banging around.

46:05.081 --> 46:06.082
Think so?

46:06.332 --> 46:09.251
Not a chance.

46:11.128 --> 46:13.255
We got to get past that door.

46:13.506 --> 46:16.926
Let's go!

46:25.559 --> 46:28.353
Come on!

46:35.527 --> 46:36.737
Open the door!

46:36.987 --> 46:39.573
Go! Go!

47:10.853 --> 47:13.773
Bird!

47:14.315 --> 47:15.775
Come on, bird!

47:16.025 --> 47:19.403
Where are you, bird?

47:23.783 --> 47:27.036
Hey, dickhead!

47:27.328 --> 47:29.955
Bird?

47:30.247 --> 47:31.540
Fat butt!

47:31.790 --> 47:34.585
Bird?

47:38.964 --> 47:42.426
Anybody here?

47:43.635 --> 47:46.346
-Cowboy, let me ask you a question.
-We should keep moving.

47:46.597 --> 47:49.766
I'm talking to him!

47:52.019 --> 47:54.688
Was that a goddamn shark
that broke through that door?

47:54.938 --> 47:55.731
I expect so.

47:55.981 --> 47:58.692
You expect so?

47:58.942 --> 48:00.152
Well, well, well.

48:00.402 --> 48:05.657
Am I the only asshole down here
who thinks that a tad bit odd?

48:05.657 --> 48:09.828
It can do that? Bust through a steel door?

48:10.078 --> 48:12.413
I ain't the expert.

48:12.664 --> 48:15.166
Given Gen 2's size
and some room to move...

48:15.416 --> 48:20.129
...she could put a couple tons,
maybe more, into a hit.

48:20.380 --> 48:22.507
So, yeah, in my opinion.

48:22.757 --> 48:25.468
If she wants through, she's coming.

48:25.718 --> 48:27.637
And these sharks...

48:27.887 --> 48:31.390
...they aren't breaking down doors
for the sheer joy of it, are they?

48:31.641 --> 48:34.852
They're after us.

48:35.019 --> 48:39.273
It's obvious we don't know
what they're doing.

48:42.651 --> 48:47.156
What the hell did you do to those sharks?

48:48.574 --> 48:54.163
Their brains weren't large enough to
harvest sufficient amounts of the protein.

48:54.413 --> 48:58.584
So we violated the Harvard Compact.

49:00.002 --> 49:02.879
Jim and I used gene therapies
to increase their brain mass.

49:03.130 --> 49:06.216
Larger brain means more protein.

49:06.466 --> 49:10.887
As a side effect, the sharks got smarter.

49:12.806 --> 49:16.643
You stupid bitch!

49:23.108 --> 49:26.402
I didn't want this to happen...

49:26.653 --> 49:31.574
...but with this research, we could
wipe out degenerative brain disease.

49:31.824 --> 49:34.577
Think of the generations
that would be saved.

49:34.827 --> 49:41.209
How much dynamite do you have to set off
in your ears before your head clears?

49:41.334 --> 49:43.878
You wouldn't understand.

49:44.128 --> 49:46.589
I wouldn't?

49:46.839 --> 49:52.470
Dumb old Carter wouldn't understand
that you used us?

49:53.387 --> 49:56.682
That you used me?

49:56.849 --> 49:59.894
Someone on the water
who wouldn't make waves.

50:00.144 --> 50:02.771
Someone who wouldn't ask
too many questions.

50:03.022 --> 50:04.523
Because he had something to lose.

50:04.773 --> 50:06.358
You don't see what we've done here.

50:06.608 --> 50:09.987
You've taken God's oldest killing machine
and given it will and desire.

50:10.237 --> 50:14.616
You've knocked us to the bottom
of the goddamn food chain.

50:14.867 --> 50:19.037
It's not a great leap forward, in my book.

50:20.288 --> 50:21.623
The people we'll save....

50:21.873 --> 50:25.460
Jim? Brenda?

50:25.794 --> 50:28.505
Us?

50:29.172 --> 50:30.840
All right, people.

50:31.091 --> 50:35.303
These sharks are thinking hard and clear.

50:35.553 --> 50:37.680
So here's the riddle.

50:37.931 --> 50:39.974
What does an 8,000-pound mako shark...

50:40.225 --> 50:46.064
...with a brain the size of a V8 engine
and no natural predators, think about?

50:46.147 --> 50:49.233
I'm not waiting around here to find out.

50:49.484 --> 50:51.277
Now you see how that works?

50:51.527 --> 50:56.866
She screwed with the sharks
and now the sharks are screwing with us.

51:14.508 --> 51:18.012
Please let me get out of here.

52:22.450 --> 52:25.411
What if the sharks get through the fence
and into the ocean?

52:25.661 --> 52:28.497
It's okay. The fence
on the ocean side is titanium.

52:28.747 --> 52:31.000
And it gives, so it works just like a net.

52:31.250 --> 52:36.296
Let's get to the sub.
We'll discuss it on the way to the top.

53:47.700 --> 53:50.869
Eat me, asshole.

53:53.956 --> 53:55.707
Careful, now.

53:55.958 --> 53:59.211
Come on, bird. Come on.

53:59.461 --> 54:00.504
Please, baby.

54:00.754 --> 54:01.463
Dickhead.

54:01.713 --> 54:04.925
See Daddy smiling?

54:05.175 --> 54:06.009
Come on.

54:06.259 --> 54:10.096
Bring your feathery ass here. Come on.

54:43.296 --> 54:45.715
-Explosion caused that?
-No.

54:45.965 --> 54:51.637
Nothing in here could've blown
with enough force to move that damn sub.

54:51.887 --> 54:54.181
Whatever. It's junk.

54:54.431 --> 55:00.229
We could all just dive in
and see who makes it to the top.

55:02.189 --> 55:05.609
Isn't that the old Aquatica spirit, Dr. Susie?

55:05.859 --> 55:09.571
Just dive in.

55:10.739 --> 55:12.908
You could go first, to lead by example.

55:13.158 --> 55:14.701
He was my best friend, Janice.

55:14.952 --> 55:16.119
I'm not going in the water.

55:16.370 --> 55:19.289
-No way, man! The sharks are in there.
-Listen!

55:19.539 --> 55:23.710
We put these on. They help
fight hypothermia. That's a start.

55:23.960 --> 55:26.588
And unless someone's got a better idea...

55:26.838 --> 55:30.300
...we're going to have to swim out of here.

55:48.484 --> 55:52.530
This isn't happening.

56:15.219 --> 56:19.348
I'm not Daniel when he faced the lion!

56:23.644 --> 56:26.313
So I appreciate the irony, Lord!

56:26.563 --> 56:30.067
"Cook dies in his own oven!"

56:30.442 --> 56:34.780
But I've got other plans!

57:11.440 --> 57:14.610
You ate my bird.

57:25.496 --> 57:26.539
Was that the surface?

57:26.789 --> 57:31.168
No, the vibrations are too deep.
That was from inside.

57:40.219 --> 57:41.678
I wouldn't get that close.

57:41.929 --> 57:43.805
Just a suggestion.

57:44.056 --> 57:46.725
Water's murky. We might make it.

57:46.975 --> 57:50.896
No way! No, we won't!

57:51.605 --> 57:53.690
It's 230 feet...

57:53.940 --> 57:57.611
...from the lagoon floor
to the lagoon surface!

57:57.861 --> 58:00.572
The average human swims
two feet per second.

58:00.822 --> 58:03.867
The average shark swims
50 feet per second.

58:04.117 --> 58:07.287
There's no way I'm getting into that pool!

58:07.537 --> 58:10.582
What we have here is
your basic maintenance ladder.

58:10.832 --> 58:12.625
This leads up to the surface.

58:12.875 --> 58:15.920
I love you, Scoggs. I really do!

58:16.170 --> 58:19.215
Why do I feel a "but" coming on?

58:19.257 --> 58:22.135
But we don't know what shape
the surface level is in.

58:22.385 --> 58:23.803
The shaft is air-locked.

58:24.053 --> 58:27.139
But if the explosion breached the shaft
at surface level...

58:27.390 --> 58:29.976
...we won't have enough pressure
to stabilize the wet pool.

58:30.226 --> 58:34.647
If the pool isn't stabilized,
there's tons of ocean dying to get in.

58:34.897 --> 58:36.941
You'll bring the whole facility down.

58:37.191 --> 58:39.026
We're better off with the sharks.

58:39.276 --> 58:41.612
You want to swim with your fishes?
Go ahead!

58:41.862 --> 58:44.198
I'm opening this door
and climbing out of here!

58:44.448 --> 58:47.117
-The hell you are!
-I don't work for you anymore!

58:47.368 --> 58:49.328
-I don't have to take orders!
-Enough!

58:49.578 --> 58:53.749
That's enough now, from all of you!

58:56.293 --> 58:58.211
You think water's fast?

58:58.462 --> 59:02.966
You should see ice.
It moves like it has a mind.

59:03.216 --> 59:08.763
Like it knows it killed the world once.
It got a taste for murder.

59:08.805 --> 59:10.765
When the avalanche came...

59:11.016 --> 59:14.185
...it took us a week to climb out.

59:14.436 --> 59:19.065
And somewhere we lost hope.

59:19.399 --> 59:23.528
I don't know when we turned
on each other.

59:23.778 --> 59:25.363
I just know...

59:25.613 --> 59:29.200
...that seven of us survived the slide...

59:29.450 --> 59:33.246
...and only five made it out.

59:34.163 --> 59:38.042
Now, we took an oath
that I'm breaking now.

59:38.292 --> 59:42.171
Swore that we'd say it was the snow
that killed the other two.

59:42.421 --> 59:44.548
But it wasn't.

59:44.799 --> 59:47.676
Nature can be lethal.

59:47.927 --> 59:52.139
But it doesn't hold a candle to man.

59:53.265 --> 59:57.978
You've seen how bad things can get
and how quick they can get that way.

59:58.228 --> 01:00:00.647
Well, they can get a whole lot worse.

01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:05.277
So we're not going to fight anymore!

01:00:05.527 --> 01:00:11.033
We're going to pull together
and find a way to get out of here!

01:00:11.283 --> 01:00:15.287
First, we're going to seal off this pool!

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.928
Oh, my God.

01:00:41.312 --> 01:00:43.564
It just ate him.

01:00:43.815 --> 01:00:46.818
It just ate him. Christ!

01:00:47.068 --> 01:00:48.778
I'm not moving.

01:00:49.028 --> 01:00:51.072
I'm not moving. Someone will come.

01:00:51.322 --> 01:00:55.076
They'll come and they'll get us,
and we'll be fine.

01:00:55.326 --> 01:00:57.495
No. I'm not moving.

01:00:57.745 --> 01:01:02.875
Listen, Tom, what is the precise
structural failure limit for Aquatica?

01:01:03.125 --> 01:01:04.126
3,200 tons.

01:01:04.376 --> 01:01:10.090
What happens when we get more
than 3,200 tons of water in this rig?

01:01:11.967 --> 01:01:16.305
The support struts go first.
Their tolerance is about seven tons.

01:01:16.555 --> 01:01:18.599
They'll crack like toothpicks.

01:01:18.849 --> 01:01:23.979
The walls will buckle. They can't handle
more than 10 tons of pressure.

01:01:29.901 --> 01:01:33.321
You want to be here for that?

01:01:39.327 --> 01:01:42.163
Hell, no.

01:01:44.958 --> 01:01:48.920
The moment of truth. Again.

01:02:02.934 --> 01:02:06.229
Go! Go! Go!

01:02:58.446 --> 01:03:01.157
I got you.

01:03:05.161 --> 01:03:08.373
It's burning!

01:03:14.462 --> 01:03:15.963
The elevator's blocking the top.

01:03:16.214 --> 01:03:21.010
If we make it to Level 1,
we can take the stairs out.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:56.837
Let's get out of here!

01:03:57.087 --> 01:04:00.215
Go! Go!

01:04:02.008 --> 01:04:03.385
What are you doing?

01:04:03.635 --> 01:04:06.638
If they break through,
water will bring them right to us.

01:04:06.888 --> 01:04:10.183
Level 2 is only partially flooded.
If I can get that door open...

01:04:10.433 --> 01:04:15.230
...the water will run off there,
buy us some time.

01:04:16.439 --> 01:04:18.483
Big, real big.

01:04:18.733 --> 01:04:22.278
-What's that?
-The size of your brass balls.

01:04:22.528 --> 01:04:25.573
Be careful.

01:04:33.581 --> 01:04:36.209
Go!

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:18.892
Jan, stay there!

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:26.733
Get me out of here, Carter!

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:28.527
I don't want to die!

01:06:28.777 --> 01:06:32.322
Grab my hand! Come on!

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:33.782
I can't!

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:36.910
I can't reach!

01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:41.331
-Take it!
-I can't reach!

01:07:28.001 --> 01:07:31.713
Can you reach that door above you?

01:07:34.049 --> 01:07:36.343
It's too high.

01:07:36.593 --> 01:07:39.638
It's too high.

01:08:00.283 --> 01:08:04.162
Sharks probably flooded that level too.

01:08:35.693 --> 01:08:38.569
Good thing you came to this side.
The other side's underwater.

01:08:38.821 --> 01:08:41.698
-We didn't exactly plan it.
-Yeah, it wasn't planned.

01:08:41.948 --> 01:08:45.368
Are you all that made it?

01:08:50.666 --> 01:08:51.875
We did it.

01:08:52.125 --> 01:08:55.337
We're on Level 1.
We can take the stairs to the surface.

01:08:55.587 --> 01:08:57.631
The stairs are flooded. Trust me, I know.

01:08:57.881 --> 01:09:00.341
Are you sure?

01:09:00.591 --> 01:09:04.720
Give us a goddamn break, can't You?

01:09:14.773 --> 01:09:17.149
He always answers.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:22.113
Sometimes, the answer you get
isn't the answer you want.

01:09:25.073 --> 01:09:27.910
We're 60 feet from the surface.

01:09:28.161 --> 01:09:31.913
There's an emergency hatch
on this level, right?

01:09:32.165 --> 01:09:34.584
This level has bilge pumps on it
for storm runoff.

01:09:34.834 --> 01:09:39.796
If we re-route the emergency generators,
we could drain a stairway.

01:09:40.046 --> 01:09:41.298
You sure?

01:09:41.549 --> 01:09:44.718
Who you going to trust?

01:09:46.761 --> 01:09:48.305
-You.
-That's right.

01:09:48.555 --> 01:09:51.600
You trust me.

01:09:59.608 --> 01:10:02.236
We had poker here tomorrow night.

01:10:02.486 --> 01:10:05.948
She'd always draw to the inside straight
when she could've stuck with a pair.

01:10:06.198 --> 01:10:09.242
Big dreams.

01:10:14.873 --> 01:10:19.252
Even in death: Standards.

01:10:19.711 --> 01:10:24.674
Jan was a healthy girl.
Something in here has to run on batteries.

01:10:24.924 --> 01:10:28.803
-Nice.
-Where would a girl keep her...

01:10:29.053 --> 01:10:29.888
...thing?

01:10:30.138 --> 01:10:32.849
What's the matter with you?

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.024
My skin's starting to hemorrhage.

01:10:42.275 --> 01:10:45.736
The sharks smell the blood.

01:10:45.987 --> 01:10:47.321
This'll coat it with oil.

01:10:47.572 --> 01:10:51.367
Look, Carter, what you said down there...

01:10:51.617 --> 01:10:54.704
...maybe you were right.

01:10:54.954 --> 01:10:58.374
Everything I've done...

01:10:58.916 --> 01:11:01.961
...I don't think I could've done it
without you.

01:11:02.211 --> 01:11:07.508
I know, Susan. That's the problem.

01:11:08.342 --> 01:11:10.135
Four a.m.

01:11:10.386 --> 01:11:11.512
I know.

01:11:11.762 --> 01:11:14.890
One night feels like a whole week.

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.725
Relativity.

01:11:16.975 --> 01:11:18.227
What do you mean?

01:11:18.477 --> 01:11:21.146
Einstein's theory of relativity.

01:11:21.396 --> 01:11:25.108
Grab hold of a hot pan,
a second can seem like an hour.

01:11:25.358 --> 01:11:27.694
Put your hands on a hot woman...

01:11:27.944 --> 01:11:30.155
...an hour can seem like a second.

01:11:30.405 --> 01:11:33.783
It's all relative.

01:11:36.161 --> 01:11:42.333
I spent four years at Cal Tech. That's
the best physics explanation I've heard.

01:11:43.835 --> 01:11:46.671
It works.

01:11:46.754 --> 01:11:48.339
You stay with the doc.

01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:51.175
Me and Scoggs are going to try
to get to the wet lab...

01:11:51.426 --> 01:11:54.887
...drain that stairwell.

01:11:57.056 --> 01:12:00.393
-Preach?
-What?

01:12:00.977 --> 01:12:04.689
Would you zip me up, please?

01:12:34.593 --> 01:12:37.012
We got one, there's two sharks left...

01:12:37.262 --> 01:12:40.474
...and you and the doc are doing
a little bathroom love.

01:12:40.724 --> 01:12:44.895
They got a pill for what's wrong with you?

01:12:53.945 --> 01:12:58.116
I need to get some things
from my quarters. Research data.

01:12:58.366 --> 01:13:00.785
The tests, they worked.

01:13:01.035 --> 01:13:06.541
So much death around us,
to risk any more life for some numbers....

01:13:06.874 --> 01:13:11.629
Without that data, everyone dying
isn't just tragic, it's useless.

01:13:11.879 --> 01:13:15.758
Death is always useless, Doctor.

01:13:25.184 --> 01:13:28.229
This is it.

01:13:32.399 --> 01:13:36.028
Stay here. I'll be back before you know it.

01:14:45.763 --> 01:14:47.473
What's going on?

01:14:47.723 --> 01:14:49.683
What the hell's going on? What is that?

01:14:49.933 --> 01:14:51.352
It's okay!

01:14:51.602 --> 01:14:53.562
-What is that?
-We're all right!

01:14:53.812 --> 01:14:57.858
-What the fuck?
-It's okay.

01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:02.279
I thought you were coming back for me.

01:15:02.529 --> 01:15:05.449
One of your monitors is blocking the panel.

01:15:05.699 --> 01:15:07.659
You want to help me move it?

01:15:07.909 --> 01:15:11.955
I say we do everything right together.

01:15:12.164 --> 01:15:14.791
Right together.

01:15:27.762 --> 01:15:29.806
Hello.

01:15:30.056 --> 01:15:32.767
My name is Sherman Dudley...

01:15:33.017 --> 01:15:37.814
...and if this message finds you,
I did not survive, so this is my legacy.

01:15:38.064 --> 01:15:42.235
I have loved the pulpit
and I have loved the bottle.

01:15:42.485 --> 01:15:46.864
I did my best to be a good husband,
a f ather.

01:15:47.114 --> 01:15:49.784
I came up wanting.

01:15:50.034 --> 01:15:53.537
So what do I have to say to you?

01:15:53.788 --> 01:15:57.833
What mark do I have to leave behind?

01:16:02.296 --> 01:16:05.549
We'll begin with the perfect omelet,
made with two eggs, not three.

01:16:05.799 --> 01:16:10.512
Amateurs often add milk for density.
This is a mistake.

01:18:44.538 --> 01:18:47.416
Come on!

01:19:18.696 --> 01:19:22.116
I got you. Come on.

01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:37.631
Damn you, Scoggs.

01:19:47.016 --> 01:19:50.060
Where's Susan?

01:19:51.145 --> 01:19:52.020
I'm done.

01:19:52.271 --> 01:19:57.442
Brothers never make it out
of situations like this. Not ever!

01:23:57.844 --> 01:23:59.095
Did you do it?

01:23:59.346 --> 01:24:02.348
Where's Scoggins?

01:24:03.892 --> 01:24:06.561
I hate to interrupt this moment
of burgeoning intimacy...

01:24:06.811 --> 01:24:10.189
...but can we get the fuck out of here?

01:24:19.699 --> 01:24:21.534
-Is this the only way?
-Exits are flooded.

01:24:21.784 --> 01:24:26.038
Whole place is sinking.
It's this way or no way at all.

01:24:26.289 --> 01:24:28.708
You can bring on the good news
anytime now.

01:24:28.958 --> 01:24:32.670
Sharks are attracted to churning water,
bright colors.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:36.590
These extinguishers will be a distraction.

01:24:36.841 --> 01:24:38.133
What about us?

01:24:38.384 --> 01:24:43.263
The vest'll bring you up too fast.
Your lungs'll pop like a balloon.

01:24:43.514 --> 01:24:45.474
You weren't the sunny kid in your class.

01:24:45.724 --> 01:24:48.310
I never went to class.

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.896
How far to the surface? Sixty feet?

01:24:51.146 --> 01:24:52.064
There's nothing to it.

01:24:52.314 --> 01:24:56.902
Exhale on the way up,
and get the hell out of the water.

01:24:57.152 --> 01:25:01.239
I got to equalize the pressure
before we blow the air lock.

01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:04.576
I got to let the room fill up with water.

01:25:04.826 --> 01:25:07.871
It'll only take a few seconds.

01:25:08.121 --> 01:25:10.498
You ready?

01:25:10.749 --> 01:25:12.500
No.

01:25:12.751 --> 01:25:15.378
Not in the least.

01:25:32.895 --> 01:25:35.565
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

01:25:35.815 --> 01:25:37.191
"...I shall fear no evil...

01:25:37.441 --> 01:25:38.734
"...for Thou art with me...

01:25:38.985 --> 01:25:41.279
"...Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me.

01:25:41.529 --> 01:25:45.908
"Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life... "

01:25:46.158 --> 01:25:47.952
...because I carry a big stick...

01:25:48.202 --> 01:25:50.663
...and I'm the meanest motherfucker
in the valley.

01:25:50.913 --> 01:25:53.958
Two sharks down, Lord.
One demon fish to go.

01:25:54.208 --> 01:25:55.501
Can I get an "amen"?

01:25:55.751 --> 01:25:56.418
Amen!

01:25:56.669 --> 01:25:59.672
-I can't hear you!
-Amen!

01:25:59.922 --> 01:26:01.090
Give me an "amen"!

01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:04.885
-Stay with us, Lord!
-Amen.

01:26:06.428 --> 01:26:08.764
Okay, hold on three! Ready?

01:26:09.014 --> 01:26:12.684
One! Two! Three!

01:27:47.277 --> 01:27:50.071
Swim!

01:28:26.565 --> 01:28:29.443
Oh, my God!

01:29:05.770 --> 01:29:09.232
It's the devil, you know.

01:29:19.033 --> 01:29:23.287
He'll be okay if we can get out of here.

01:29:33.797 --> 01:29:35.466
Son of a bitch.

01:29:35.716 --> 01:29:36.675
What?

01:29:36.926 --> 01:29:42.848
Those fences are titanium underneath,
but on top, they're just plain steel.

01:29:43.682 --> 01:29:46.560
They've been herding us,
pushing us where they want.

01:29:46.810 --> 01:29:50.689
Using us to flood the facility.

01:29:51.356 --> 01:29:53.483
Oh, my God.

01:29:53.734 --> 01:29:55.360
That's the answer to the riddle.

01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:59.614
Because that's what
an 8,000-pound mako thinks about.

01:29:59.865 --> 01:30:02.993
About freedom.

01:30:03.326 --> 01:30:06.997
About the deep blue sea.

01:30:08.415 --> 01:30:11.751
We have to kill her.

01:30:12.502 --> 01:30:17.465
That's the first real smart thing
you've said all day.

01:30:20.468 --> 01:30:23.263
Here we go.

01:30:39.236 --> 01:30:42.323
Let's go.

01:30:51.206 --> 01:30:56.503
We ought to get 2.5 sticks of dynamite
out of these flares.

01:31:00.507 --> 01:31:03.010
From up here, you ought to be able
to see me spear it.

01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:05.804
When I do, you take this end of this cable...

01:31:06.054 --> 01:31:08.724
...hook it up to the positive side
of the boat battery.

01:31:08.974 --> 01:31:11.893
And boom!

01:31:47.136 --> 01:31:49.388
Damn! I can't get her!

01:31:49.639 --> 01:31:53.017
She's too far away!

01:31:53.309 --> 01:31:55.478
I know how to get her.

01:31:55.728 --> 01:31:58.022
How?

01:31:58.272 --> 01:32:00.816
Bait.

01:32:13.704 --> 01:32:16.206
She may be the smartest animal
in the world...

01:32:16.457 --> 01:32:20.502
...but she's still just an animal.

01:32:20.502 --> 01:32:23.463
Come to Mama.

01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:38.603
No!

01:32:41.356 --> 01:32:44.234
Susan, don't!

01:32:58.998 --> 01:33:02.210
Get out of the water!

01:34:55.195 --> 01:34:56.530
All right, Lord....

01:34:56.780 --> 01:34:58.281
Shoot it, Preach!

01:34:58.532 --> 01:34:59.991
This is for Scoggins.

01:35:00.242 --> 01:35:02.911
Shoot it!

01:35:08.458 --> 01:35:11.252
Damn!

01:35:15.215 --> 01:35:17.675
Blow it, Preach! Blow it!

01:35:17.926 --> 01:35:19.093
The battery!

01:35:19.344 --> 01:35:22.180
Blow it!

01:35:24.766 --> 01:35:27.894
Do it!

01:36:28.536 --> 01:36:31.873
Bring me some sushi!

01:36:55.396 --> 01:36:57.022
Forty-five-foot shark...

01:36:57.273 --> 01:36:59.066
...and you hit me.

01:36:59.316 --> 01:37:01.068
Nice.

01:37:01.318 --> 01:37:05.990
Could've been worse.
I could've let him eat your ass.

01:37:11.745 --> 01:37:14.122
Hey, Carter, we're sinking, right?

01:37:14.373 --> 01:37:16.166
Yeah.

01:37:16.416 --> 01:37:19.628
Let me ask you something.

01:37:19.878 --> 01:37:22.464
Are you sure it was just three sharks?

01:37:22.714 --> 01:37:26.342
- Yeah.
- Oh, Okay.

01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:37.520
That's more like it.

01:37:44.110 --> 01:37:46.905
Here comes the next shift.

01:37:47.155 --> 01:37:48.865
Let me tell you, man...

01:37:49.115 --> 01:37:52.493
...I quit this job.

01:37:55.121 --> 01:37:57.707
Take me back to the ghetto.

01:37:57.957 --> 01:38:00.835
Amen.
