WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:03.804
Lady Luck
is on your side
from LA to Vegas.

00:03.837 --> 00:06.907
What, are you gonna put
a sock on the cockpit door?
Don't cockpit-block me.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.342
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.046
The Mick, The Last Man on Earth,

00:12.080 --> 00:13.247
and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.582
The kids are gonna love it.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.021
Hey, guys.

00:21.055 --> 00:24.024
Ronnie, where's your uniform?
You look like a pheasant.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.993
You mean peasant.
She looks like a peasant.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.262
-Pheasant is a bird.
-I'm so confused.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.531
When I was a boy,
we used to hunt both.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.266
I'm not working today.

00:32.300 --> 00:33.867
Actually, me and Bernard
and Dave

00:33.901 --> 00:36.270
are flying over to Phoenix
for Jackpot training.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.706
Jackpot training.
What, you need a refresher

00:38.739 --> 00:40.941
on how to tip a can
when you pour a drink?

00:40.974 --> 00:42.543
Are you sure you want to be
that condescending

00:42.576 --> 00:44.212
to the people who pour you
those drinks?

00:44.245 --> 00:45.846
I instantly regretted it.
I'm truly sorry.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.381
-You're a national treasure.
-RONNIE: Mm-hmm.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.250
Yeah, to be honest,
it's called training,

00:49.283 --> 00:51.252
but it's really
two days of partying,

00:51.285 --> 00:53.454
-drinking out of ice luges.
-And sexual assignations.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.123
Last year, we went through

00:55.156 --> 00:56.790
-two Olympic villages
worth of condoms.
-Mm-hmm.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.093
You see, Jackpot doesn't
do things like bonuses

00:59.127 --> 01:00.728
or health insurance
or bathroom breaks,

01:00.761 --> 01:03.231
so this is their unofficial way
of making it up to us.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.065
Grapefruits' training
is just a few dance lessons

01:05.099 --> 01:06.634
and how to say "help" in Russian

01:06.667 --> 01:08.536
in case you wake up
in a shipping container.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.570
Hmm.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.272
I can see by your sad faces

01:11.305 --> 01:12.740
you've been delivered
the bad news.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.142
Your flight today
will be lacking

01:14.175 --> 01:16.244
a certain je ne sais Dave.

01:16.277 --> 01:19.079
That's French for moi.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.682
Come on, fellas.
We got a party to get to.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.590
Did he just drive away
on his suitcase?

01:29.623 --> 01:32.626
Wow, it carries your stuff
and you can ride it.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.595
Sorry, donkeys,
you had a good run.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.929
PILOT :
Jackpot Airlines.

01:35.963 --> 01:37.931
Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.933
*

01:47.141 --> 01:48.776
This couldn't be coming
at a better time.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.077
After these last few months,

01:50.110 --> 01:52.446
I could use two days of
guilt-free sanctioned partying.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.482
Looks like you already started.
What is that?

01:54.515 --> 01:55.916
A Bakersfield mimosa.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.785
Sparkling wine and orange
Jell

01:57.818 --> 01:59.953
Hey, you're using
the purse I got you.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.189
No, thank you, Ronnie.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.690
I want to be alert
and clear-eyed

02:02.723 --> 02:04.458
for my pending rendezvous
with flight attendant tonight

02:04.492 --> 02:06.160
and flight attendant tomorrow.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.995
I have no intention
of learning their names.

02:08.028 --> 02:09.330
Your loss. Dave?

02:09.363 --> 02:11.532
No. I have a cigar
and snifter of scotch

02:11.565 --> 02:13.967
waiting for me when
I get upstairs to meet the boys.

02:14.001 --> 02:16.370
It's gonna feel real good
to kick back, light one up,

02:16.404 --> 02:18.472
and trade stories with
Captain Gus and Captain Al.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.474
Oh, look.
There's your hallway

02:20.508 --> 02:22.343
back to the golden age
for white guys.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.445
Tell the misogyny we say hi.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.147
I will.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.383
:
I'm so excited, Bernard.

02:29.417 --> 02:31.685
I heard this year there's
gonna be a martini station,

02:31.719 --> 02:33.387
a mashed potato bar,

02:33.421 --> 02:36.790
and a surprising amount of those
bummer desk, chair things.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.859
How the hell are we
supposed to have sex on those?

02:38.892 --> 02:40.160
Never mind, I figured it out.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.332
Hi. Hi. Excuse me.
You look official.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.467
What's going on?
Where's the bar?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.202
Oh, sorry... Ronnie.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.137
Uh, there's not gonna be
a bar this year.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.140
Okay, so w
It's just kegs?

02:53.173 --> 02:56.810
No, what I'm saying is
that the parties are off.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.145
Jackpot has had
a significant number

02:58.178 --> 03:00.147
of complaints lodged
against them this year,

03:00.180 --> 03:03.150
so they brought me in
to implement a new policy.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.653
This training seminar
is going to be

03:05.686 --> 03:08.489
structured, rigid
and mandatory.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.324
Fun's over.

03:10.358 --> 03:14.027
I'm gonna sulk in a sex desk.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.864
It's Captain Dave time.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.166
Are you the flight instructor?

03:19.199 --> 03:21.168
Hi, I'm Captain Jayden.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.405
I'm not your... What's a Jayden?
Where's Gus and Al?

03:24.438 --> 03:27.074
How come I'm not choking
on cigar smoke right now?

03:27.107 --> 03:30.544
Hunter, Aden, Jayden, can we get
this guy a chair and some water?

03:30.578 --> 03:33.847
He's confused.
Sir, it's going to be okay.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.083
-PHIL: Captain Dave.
-Oh, Phil. Thank God.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.185
Did I walk into day care?
Where's the crew?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.620
Sorry, Dave.
I thought you heard.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.555
You're the last
of the old guard.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.592
Now that Al's with United and
Gus is reunited with his wife,

03:44.625 --> 03:46.427
you're training with
all the newbies this year.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.262
That's no problem.
We're all pilots.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.763
We all speak the same language.

03:49.797 --> 03:52.933
Hey there, boys.
Sorry for the confusion.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.102
What are you drinking over here?
Macallan

03:55.135 --> 03:56.904
-Kombucha.
-Gesundheit.

04:04.144 --> 04:06.614
So, I spoke to the gate agent.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.049
Apparently somebody tampered
with the smoke detectors.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.418
Ugh. That happens all the time.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.885
Usually Ronnie and Bernard
just go in

04:11.919 --> 04:13.887
with a pack of Kools
and smoke it back online.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.823
Huh. Well, clearly
the replacement crew

04:15.856 --> 04:18.492
don't know that trick, so we're
gonna be delayed a while.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.094
Hey, Artem, bad news.

04:21.128 --> 04:23.431
We're not making it
back to L.A. anytime soon,

04:23.464 --> 04:25.933
so you have to find someone
to run your hot sauce booth

04:25.966 --> 04:28.235
-at the farmer's market.
-Shh. I'm concentrating.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.438
That slot machine
has not paid out in weeks.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.172
And according to my numbers,

04:32.205 --> 04:35.643
in the next 200 spins,
there will be a huge payout.

04:35.676 --> 04:39.012
And that payout
is more than $100,000.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.781
Well, the problem
is that old lady.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.182
She hasn't moved for hours.

04:42.215 --> 04:46.119
She's very stubborn,
like stain in a Tide commercial.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.788
Hey, if we help you
get that machine,

04:47.821 --> 04:50.290
will you split the winnings
with us? I could use the money.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.759
Grapefruits has really
been struggling ever since

04:51.792 --> 04:53.461
that taco place went topless.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.263
Well, yeah. And I want to put
a down payment on a house.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.165
I could be that
rarest of unicorns:

04:58.198 --> 04:59.867
a homeowner and an educator.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.268
Okay, you got a deal.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.304
We can split the money, if
you can get that old lady off.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.340
Well, then we better
get that old lady off quick.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.576
Let's maybe stop talking
about getting an old lady off.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.812
I can't believe they're
treating us like this.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.447
No one needs this party
more than me.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.648
Uh, I don't know,

05:14.682 --> 05:16.850
except maybe the person
who does most of your work.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.387
Jean Chris, my exfoliator?
Please. He loves what he does.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.890
Hey, this is a bummer for
everyone. We all needed this.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.324
Yeah. I'm furious.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.394
What am I gonna do
with all these shrooms?

05:26.427 --> 05:28.796
-I think you ate them.
-Oh, yeah.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.331
Well, what am I gonna do
with all these shrooms?

05:31.365 --> 05:34.234
Okay, that Jackpot Reno crew

05:34.267 --> 05:36.036
-knows how to party.
-Is terrifying.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.838
Everyone, take your seats.

05:37.871 --> 05:41.308
So, you've all heard about
the revamped training.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.177
Up here, you'll see
the revised itinerary.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.046
We'll start every day
7:00 a.m....

05:46.079 --> 05:48.416
Okay, I have to say something.

05:48.449 --> 05:51.051
This is total horse crap.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.153
We all work our asses off,

05:53.186 --> 05:55.656
and we deserve two days a year
to enjoy ourselves.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.658
There have been quite a few...

05:57.691 --> 05:59.860
Complaints. Yes, I know.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.695
But, news flash,
we're an airline.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.431
Of course we're gonna
have complaints.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.833
People hate lines, hassles
and facing their own mortality,

06:05.866 --> 06:07.868
and we make them pay
for all three.

06:07.901 --> 06:11.338
So we demand to know
what was so bad

06:11.371 --> 06:12.906
that now we're being punished.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.675
ALL:
Yeah!

06:14.708 --> 06:17.611
Okay. I didn't really want
to single anybody out,

06:17.645 --> 06:20.581
but since you demand to know

06:20.614 --> 06:23.350
what caught our attention,
here it is.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.118
BERNARD :
Sir, I'm sorry.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.788
You won't stay in your seat,
so you've given us no choice.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.924
Thank you for flying Jackpot.

06:36.897 --> 06:40.568
Two million hits, though.
That's pretty cool.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.407
Hey, guys.

06:47.441 --> 06:50.611
Wow, it is rough out here.
No one will even look at us.

06:50.644 --> 06:54.548
I know. Is this what
it feels like to be a seven?

06:54.582 --> 06:56.517
Answer me, Ronnie.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.054
What are you doing?
You can't sit here.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.724
What, you're pissed at us, too?
Oh, come on.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.460
Who hasn't had to duct tape
a passenger to his seat?

07:06.494 --> 07:08.295
We were just unlucky enough
to get caught.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.964
I've never been caught
because I've never done that.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.066
Yeah, because you fly
the Albuquerque to Vegas.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.435
It's all stoic cowboys
and rustic lesbians.

07:15.469 --> 07:18.138
Well, we'll make it up to you.
We'll have our own party.

07:18.171 --> 07:21.174
I'll make Bakersfield Marys.
It's just vodka and ketchup.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.010
You should find
somewhere else to sit.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.845
Why don't you try
the Reno table?

07:30.518 --> 07:32.986
And then Gus said, "I don't care
if it's just my head

07:33.020 --> 07:35.088
and your boxers,
I can still fly this plane."

07:35.122 --> 07:36.957
And they let him.
It was a different time.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.759
I... I don't think I get it.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.961
So... so he flew
in his underwear?

07:40.994 --> 07:42.362
No, my underwear.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.164
That's why
it's such a good story.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.967
Now, a good story is the time
I flew from Newark to Dulles

07:47.000 --> 07:49.269
in 1:12 at a 30-knot wind shear.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.939
-No. You didn't. Stop it.
Tell me everything.
-Yeah. Yeah.

07:51.972 --> 07:52.940
I can't believe
I haven't told you this.

07:52.973 --> 07:53.974
I would love to hear more.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.210
You guys look like I feel.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.846
Well, not you, Bernard.
You're always a stunner.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.213
What happened to you?

08:00.247 --> 08:02.516
Ugh.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.151
Just these young guys.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.986
They look at me
like I'm a fossil.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.521
They don't appreciate
my war stories.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.189
All they care about
is their stats.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.058
They don't get
that flying is about

08:11.091 --> 08:12.660
the shared human experience.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.962
No one has ever gotten
off a plane and said,

08:14.995 --> 08:17.030
"Oh, I'm so glad
we got here so quickly."

08:17.064 --> 08:19.199
-Yes, they have.
-That's literally
all people say.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.869
At least everyone isn't pissed
at you for ruining their party.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.671
Yeah. Heard about that.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.073
So one person got duct taped,
big deal.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.408
We never claimed to be
the friendly skies.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.411
I guess it's just the three
of us versus the Jackpot world.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.480
We have to stick together
till this is over.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.048
Yeah. If we're gonna
survive this,

08:35.082 --> 08:36.850
we need to be like
Lew Wasserman and Jules Stein

08:36.884 --> 08:38.418
when MCA turned its back
on them.

08:39.587 --> 08:40.654
I'm agreeing with you.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.055
We have to stick together.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.457
For the love of God, man,
just say that!

08:47.628 --> 08:49.897
Oh, we're now in payout window.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.099
Every spin
could bring big money.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.434
Artem. I got this.

08:54.467 --> 08:57.170
I used to work
in the British Tea Museum.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.106
The median age was 82.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.508
I spent my days
leading elderly ladies

09:01.541 --> 09:04.945
down chamomile-scented halls,
steeping them in the history

09:04.978 --> 09:08.616
of our national beverage
and dusting their crumpets.

09:10.751 --> 09:13.186
I got lost in that story.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.123
-Yeah.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.868
-Hey!

09:27.901 --> 09:29.136
Get it!

09:31.404 --> 09:33.707
Ah. Mwah.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.576
Nichole, you are the luckiest,

09:36.610 --> 09:38.879
both spiritually
and genetically.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.114
You give her a pull.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.887
-No!
!

09:46.920 --> 09:48.722
-Sorry about that.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.223
I was working on this machine

09:50.257 --> 09:51.659
and I must've
tripped the circuit.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.160
It-it'll just be a little while.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.195
What?

09:56.830 --> 09:59.066
Oh, this?

09:59.099 --> 10:02.302
It's just 1.2 pounds
of timekeeping magic.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.805
It's my IWC Big Pilot's watch.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.240
-The Rolex of wristwatches.
-That's nothing.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.776
Take a look at this.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.845
This baby monitors
my body temperature,

10:11.879 --> 10:13.446
monitors my serotonin levels.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.515
I can Bluetooth it
to the on-flight computer

10:15.548 --> 10:17.117
so I can track my performance.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.452
You can probably even link it up
to your hearing aid.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.756
Well, I have you know
my hearing was injured

10:22.790 --> 10:24.257
from all my standing ovations
I get

10:24.291 --> 10:26.093
from my L.A. to Vegas flight.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.162
Also, from my time as a roadie
for The Huh, a Who cover band.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.864
Wait, you fly the L.A. to Vegas?

10:30.898 --> 10:32.632
So d-do you know those
two flight attendants

10:32.666 --> 10:33.834
that they caught on camera?

10:33.867 --> 10:35.969
Yeah. Ronnie and Bernard.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.537
That's my crew.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.973
-Oh, my God. Th-They seem crazy.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.709
You must have, like,
a hundred stories.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.878
Oh, I might have one or two.

10:44.912 --> 10:47.614
There was one time when
they buried an unruly passenger

10:47.647 --> 10:50.350
-under a pile of rolly bags.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.185
Oh, that's nothing.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.822
I've seen those two
use defibrillator paddles

10:54.855 --> 10:57.657
-to make a grilled cheese.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.860
-I'm lactose intolerant.
-Yeah, we all are, Carter.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.162
-Shut up. He's holding court.
-Yeah, shut up, Carter.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.833
-Sorry for the delay.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.334
Jackpot Flight 1610

11:07.367 --> 11:09.703
service to Los Angeles
is now boarding.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.806
That's our flight.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.743
Sir, how much longer before
that machine gets fixed?

11:15.776 --> 11:17.644
Hey, these things
take time, man.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.413
Well, then that's it.
Yeah. Let's go home.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.083
So much for being
a unicorn with a mortgage.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.185
Guess I'm back to being
a horse who rents.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.586
Well, we can't give up.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.255
Since the delay,

11:28.288 --> 11:31.324
we're out $72 on overpriced
airport hamburgers,

11:31.358 --> 11:35.362
$21 on water bottles and $11
on Artem's Judith Krantz book.

11:35.395 --> 11:38.231
Yeah. They say her books
are formulaic,

11:38.265 --> 11:41.101
but when the formula
is perfect...

11:41.134 --> 11:42.669
We're in too deep.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.404
We started something
and we have to finish it.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.073
I say we ditch the flight

11:46.106 --> 11:48.008
and wait for the machine
to be fixed. Who's with me?

11:48.041 --> 11:51.078
-I am.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.013
Oh, it's gonna hit big.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.882
Then I'm in.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.384
Who has a fun way
to pass the time?

12:00.587 --> 12:05.058
"It was never more difficult
for a woman to be beautiful

12:05.092 --> 12:08.295
than during the 1920s."

12:10.497 --> 12:13.033
Hey, why do you think Layla just
called us in for this meeting?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.701
Whatever it is, just deny.

12:14.734 --> 12:18.305
Like Bjorn, my Swedish
orthopedist, does to our love.

12:18.338 --> 12:22.042
Ronnie. Bernard.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.979
We would like to have
a little chat with you

12:26.013 --> 12:28.748
about some of the stories
that we have been hearing.

12:28.782 --> 12:31.251
We had assumed the video
was an isolated incident.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.953
But among other things,

12:32.986 --> 12:36.089
there's talk of smothering
a passenger with luggage

12:36.123 --> 12:38.625
and a culinary use
of the defibrillators.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.760
What do you have
to say for yourselves?

12:40.794 --> 12:42.595
-I...
-We did every single one
of those things,

12:42.629 --> 12:43.997
and I'd do
every single one again.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.899
I just realized
I do not know this bitch.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.600
When we're in the air,

12:47.634 --> 12:49.970
we have to act quickly
for the safety of everyone.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.905
And sometimes that means
grilling a cheese

12:51.939 --> 12:54.908
for a screaming kid
or using 18 pounds of luggage

12:54.942 --> 12:56.977
for a woman who forgot
her weighted blanket.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.745
We have protocol
for things like that.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.114
Well, protocol
doesn't exactly help

13:01.148 --> 13:03.183
when you're breaking apart
a bachelorette party fight

13:03.216 --> 13:04.918
between three girls
named Jessica

13:04.952 --> 13:07.287
because Jessica 2
forgot the penis pops.

13:07.320 --> 13:11.624
Bernard and I work on a flight
that has monsters,

13:11.658 --> 13:14.862
and, deep down, in places
you don't talk about at parties,

13:14.895 --> 13:16.663
you want us on that flight.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.866
You need us on that flight.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.433
Who's gonna do it

13:20.467 --> 13:22.936
You, Flight Attendant Weinberg?

13:22.970 --> 13:25.939
You are both suspended
until further notice.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.308
And when we return
to Vegas tomorrow,

13:28.341 --> 13:30.177
a disciplinary committee
will decide the best way

13:30.210 --> 13:32.145
-to move forward with you.
-I'd like to switch

13:32.179 --> 13:33.914
and become a star witness
for the prosecution.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.519
So it's always four cologne
blasts: two to the chest,

13:39.552 --> 13:41.188
one to the neck
and one to the bean bag.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.789
It burns like hell,
but let me...

13:42.822 --> 13:44.958
Hey, what the hell
have you been saying about us?

13:44.992 --> 13:46.393
What do you mean?

13:46.426 --> 13:47.961
See, he's smart enough
to deny it.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.363
Let me guess, all those
young guys were making fun

13:50.397 --> 13:52.799
of your old man shoes, and you
resorted to stories about us

13:52.832 --> 13:54.167
to get some laughs.

13:54.201 --> 13:57.504
-No. It was my old man watch.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.506
And, yeah, I told some stories,
but nothing that wasn't true.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.074
You got us suspended!

14:01.108 --> 14:02.842
We are screwed now
because you put yourself first,

14:02.876 --> 14:04.177
like you always do.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.812
To be fair,
it's not all Dave's fault.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.881
You're the one who went rogue
and started yelling at everyone.

14:07.915 --> 14:11.551
Excuse me. At least I tried
to do something to fix this.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.321
All you ever do is raise
an eyebrow, cross your arms

14:14.354 --> 14:16.489
and wait for me to finish so you
can pipe in a snarky comment.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.590
Are you done?

14:17.624 --> 14:19.226
Knew he was gonna do it.
Still loved it.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.261
Don't you take my side.
I should go tell everyone

14:21.294 --> 14:22.829
all the crazy nonsense
you do on the plane,

14:22.862 --> 14:24.431
but I won't because
I know how insecure

14:24.464 --> 14:25.732
and desperate to be liked
you are.

14:25.765 --> 14:28.035
-Thank you.
-He just insulted you, Dave.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.870
I know. How?

14:30.904 --> 14:32.039
Now you're defending him?
Please.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.340
You've been lying for years

14:33.373 --> 14:34.942
about not watching
Game of Thrones,

14:34.975 --> 14:36.709
so you don't have to deal
with all his questions.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.878
How could you? You know
how bad I am with history.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.248
I had to read the books,
and the books don't have boobs.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.882
Well, maybe
I'm just tired of you

14:42.916 --> 14:44.784
relying on me for everything.

14:44.817 --> 14:48.755
Both of you! You expect me to
have the answers all the time,

14:48.788 --> 14:51.024
and I am sick
of bailing you both out.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.559
Oh, look.
It's Ronnie the martyr.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.594
I didn't recognize you
without your crown of thorns.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.529
No spoilers.
I haven't seen season seven.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.965
RONNIE:
I think I see the problem here.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.033
We've been flying together
for way too long.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.801
We make a terrible team,

15:01.834 --> 15:04.871
and I don't know if I want
to be a part of it anymore.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.041
And cue Bernard's
snarky comment.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.743
No. This is one Ronnie speech
I agree with.

15:10.777 --> 15:14.847
Even if her hair looks like
something a goat sleeps on.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.886
Ah.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.488
Is the machine fixed yet?

15:21.521 --> 15:23.423
-Not yet.
-I don't understand.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.592
How are you two
still functioning right now?

15:25.625 --> 15:26.960
You're with a stripper
and a gambler.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.162
3:00 a.m. is the middle
of the day for us.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.964
After this,
we're going to get lunch.

15:30.998 --> 15:33.733
Now transition into Tadasana.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.305
Mm. Garudasana.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.248
So, we're almost halfway there.
You want to do a little switch

15:48.281 --> 15:49.816
and let me jockey
this thoroughbred?

15:49.849 --> 15:51.251
I'm good.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.086
I've seen guys your age
drive before,

15:53.120 --> 15:55.022
and I don't want to have
the right blinker on

15:55.055 --> 15:57.424
for the entire flight, so...

15:57.457 --> 16:00.493
Just sit back and think about
all the clothing you own

16:00.527 --> 16:03.530
that was made
before I was even born.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.267
:
Fashion's cyclical, Jayden.

16:07.300 --> 16:11.371
I am still not talking to you,
but I wanted you to have this.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.473
It's for my white suede outfit
you threw out.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.342
Oh, please.
You didn't even buy that outfit.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.976
You stole it from your mom.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.279
No. The one I stole from my mom
had a red wine stain.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.014
The one you threw out
was payment

16:21.048 --> 16:23.283
from that lawn mowing nerd
I fake-dated to make popular.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.952
Fine. Since we're doing this,

16:25.985 --> 16:28.788
this is a bill
for two months back rent.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.190
Okay, well, these cancel
each other out,

16:30.223 --> 16:31.891
so I'm just gonna tear this up,

16:31.924 --> 16:34.527
and now I'm gonna go be the hero
and get our jobs back.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.467
Look, Layla,
I'm sorry about yesterday.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.137
I reacted badly,
and if you were generous enough

16:44.171 --> 16:46.806
to lift our suspensions,
moving forward,

16:46.839 --> 16:50.210
I promise that I will
stick to protocol.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.212
What do you think?

16:52.245 --> 16:54.147
I'm sorry.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.149
I'm-I'm just trying
to figure out

16:56.183 --> 16:58.385
how you said all of that
without a mouth.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.488
What?

17:01.521 --> 17:04.224
Oh, no.
Where did you get that cookie?

17:04.257 --> 17:06.059
We have an emergency.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.860
Layla accidentally ate
a Reno cookie,

17:07.894 --> 17:10.230
and now she's high
and she thinks she's a pirate!

17:10.263 --> 17:12.031
:
Land ho, Captain!

17:12.065 --> 17:14.067
That's hilarious.
I have a hanger in my carry-on

17:14.101 --> 17:15.902
if she wants to do a hook thing.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.838
It's not just Layla.
The entire Reno crew is high.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.341
I'm not sure on what,
but it has a very

17:21.374 --> 17:23.343
"cooked in a motel bathtub"
vibe.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.112
This isn't funny.
This is an emergency!

17:25.145 --> 17:26.879
There are too many people
in this cockpit.

17:26.913 --> 17:30.217
-Everyone relax. Bernie!

17:30.250 --> 17:32.018
What's the sitch?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.753
Seth is peaking, Alison's
crying, and Scotty's trying

17:33.786 --> 17:35.855
to do a Die Hard crawl
through the overhead bins.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.357
We have to make
an emergency landing!

17:37.390 --> 17:40.293
Oh, my little Jayden.
That's the inexperience talking.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.129
-Piece of cake.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.897
Ronnie, wait.
This is important.

17:44.931 --> 17:47.367
-Save me one of those cookies.
-I already have.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.868
Nice.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.641
What the hell?

17:54.674 --> 17:57.677
I tried to make things better.
I don't think I did.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.718
I tried to warm up
a lavender eye mask

18:05.752 --> 18:07.387
to calm down Layla,
and then this happened.

18:07.420 --> 18:11.158
You never use the microwave.
That's what the paddles are for.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.260
I'll handle this,
you handle them.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.927
Let's get to work.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.565
Now would be a good time
for the captain

18:18.598 --> 18:19.766
to reassure the passengers.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.502
Oh.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.504
Hey, everyone.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.640
I-I just want to let you know
there's no reason to panic.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.176
-We are...

18:29.209 --> 18:30.910
-I...
-Never say "panic" to a plane

18:30.943 --> 18:32.812
full of passengers.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.515
This calls for the soothing,
gravely whisper

18:35.548 --> 18:38.585
forged by a thousand cigars.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.020
Hey, there, folks.
Captain Dave here.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.156
I know we got a bit
of an unexpected situation,

18:43.190 --> 18:45.158
but nothing
we just don't call a Tuesday

18:45.192 --> 18:47.194
on the old L.A. to Vegas run.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.196
This whole thing
actually reminds me

18:49.229 --> 18:51.331
of something
Captain Papa Dave once told me.

18:51.364 --> 18:54.167
He said, "Son,
do all the drugs you want.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.469
"Just don't do them
with people from Reno.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.271
Because they're sickos."

18:58.305 --> 19:02.008
Now sit back, relax and enjoy
our descent into Las Vegas.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.844
I'm gonna go ahead and turn the
fasten seat belt sign off...

19:06.346 --> 19:09.048
...because it's gonna be
a smooth landing.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.487
Layla, trust me.

19:14.521 --> 19:17.156
If you let go,
you're not gonna float away.

19:19.359 --> 19:22.495
Good. Gravity's back.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.798
-I think so. Thank you.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.335
And I'm sorry,
'cause now I understand

19:28.368 --> 19:31.804
how your way of doing things
can sometimes be just necessary.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.140
-Never happened.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.209
-Back on, next year.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.810
We were thinking next Wednesday.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.312
And we want a mashed potato bar

19:39.346 --> 19:40.847
with one of those
desk-chair combos

19:40.880 --> 19:42.982
and a private room
with a blind harp player.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.584
Whatever you want, no problem.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.152
Now, if you will excuse me,

19:46.185 --> 19:48.355
I have to go rub my face
against that wall.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.789
-Mm.
-Okay.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.393
Artem, hours ago, you said,

19:53.426 --> 19:55.262
"Trust me,
this thing is ready to pop."

19:55.295 --> 19:56.996
Yeah, but earlier,
I was mistaken.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.232
But now, believe me
when I say trust me,

19:59.266 --> 20:01.268
this thing is ready to pop.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.040
You know what? I'm done.
This-this is ridiculous.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.176
I can literally taste
my own breath.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.044
No, listen to me, my friend.

20:12.078 --> 20:14.447
Life is a slot machine.

20:14.481 --> 20:17.550
Sometimes you're wasting hours
in a chair

20:17.584 --> 20:19.719
where nothing really happens,

20:19.752 --> 20:24.123
and sometimes things line up
just in the right way

20:24.156 --> 20:26.293
and just in the right moment,

20:26.326 --> 20:29.862
and it really seems like magic

20:29.896 --> 20:32.965
-does exist after all.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.971
I hate you!
-Whoa.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.407
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Stupid machine!

20:40.440 --> 20:41.974
Stop embarrassing me
in front of my friends!

20:42.008 --> 20:43.576
-Oh, Artem, no.
-No, no, no, no, no!

20:43.610 --> 20:45.177
-He's not worth it.
-There, stop it.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.251
So...

20:52.285 --> 20:53.252
Yeah.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.322
Me, too.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.657
Listen, I might not say it
enough, but I want you both

20:57.690 --> 21:00.793
to know it's an honor
to share the sky with you.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.430
-And next time, I won't...
-Yes, you will.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.131
But I will try
really hard not to...

21:05.164 --> 21:07.099
-No, you won't.
-No one interrupt me.

21:07.133 --> 21:10.503
I'm still gonna make smart-ass
comments, and they will sting.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.507
Hey. What are you guys
still doing here?

21:14.541 --> 21:16.943
-It's a long story.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.778
Please, just get us back to L.A.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.480
Okay. Okay, come on.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.583
Let's go talk to a gate agent,
get you on a flight.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.452
-Oh, wow.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.654
Looks like someone
just won the jackpot.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.256
Wait. Was that our machine?

21:30.289 --> 21:32.325
Don't turn around.
Never turn around.

21:32.359 --> 21:35.895
MAN: The money!
It won't stop coming! I'm rich!

21:37.964 --> 21:39.899
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

21:42.034 --> 21:44.136
You've hit the jackpot
with LA to Vegas.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.673
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.876
911. What's your emergency?

21:49.909 --> 21:52.512
MAN :
I'm on Flight 46,
and we're going down.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.314
Just tell my wife
I'm so sorry that I cannot
come home to you.

21:55.348 --> 21:56.383
Hello?

21:58.518 --> 22:01.488
This is your family.
We got you, okay?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.290
Rapid response now!

22:04.323 --> 22:07.226
-We can't save everyone.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.496
It's time we showed Gotham
who we are.
