00:06.106 --> 00:08.173
(woman speaking spanish)

00:11.077 --> 00:14.113
The sweetest little
girl you've ever seen.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.088
Boy:
Ana is the only girl
I ever asked out.

00:23.090 --> 00:25.224
She said no,
but still...

00:25.226 --> 00:27.292
(voices murmuring)

00:30.397 --> 00:31.764
Kid was a force of nature.

00:31.766 --> 00:33.165
She'd come into
my class laughing,

00:33.167 --> 00:34.466
And just...
Light up the room.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.136
She will not
be forgotten.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.303
Al...

00:39.773 --> 00:41.407
Thank you for coming.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.710
Can we have a word?

00:44.712 --> 00:47.479
Of course.
Of course.

00:49.416 --> 00:51.116
Robbins:
<i>I am so sorry for your loss,</i>

00:51.118 --> 00:52.618
Gabriel.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.286
And I apologize;

00:54.288 --> 00:56.555
I still haven't heard
quite what happened.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.424
I didn't want to keep
the news of ana's death

00:58.426 --> 01:02.494
But there are certain details
of it which...

01:02.496 --> 01:04.096
Remain unclear.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.764
Three days ago,

01:05.766 --> 01:07.433
Ana was discovered dead

01:07.435 --> 01:09.168
In the border city
of arquero, mexico.

01:10.270 --> 01:12.604
The local coroner
found her license on her,

01:12.606 --> 01:14.573
Notified lvpd...

01:14.575 --> 01:17.342
Calling her death
"drug-related."

01:17.344 --> 01:18.744
They sent these photos

01:18.746 --> 01:20.512
And prints to confirm
it was ana.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.715
But he's been
otherwise uncooperative

01:23.717 --> 01:26.318
And refused to arrange transport
of the body to las vegas.

01:27.454 --> 01:29.088
Has he performed
an autopsy?

01:29.090 --> 01:32.224
I demanded that he
not proceed with one.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.492
He's wrong about
ana doing drugs,

01:33.494 --> 01:35.427
And I don't want him
getting anything else wrong.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.229
Al...

01:37.231 --> 01:40.532
I want you to go to arquero.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.334
Determine how my daughter died.

01:44.370 --> 01:46.371
Gabriel...

01:46.373 --> 01:48.774
That... That's not
something that I can do.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.677
No, no, no, you must!

01:51.679 --> 01:53.445
As my friend.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.714
Please.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.251
Since carmen's passing,
ana was all I had.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.789
I need you to make sense
of what has happened to her.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.759
She was a good girl.

02:11.164 --> 02:12.631
I've been to arquero, mexico.

<i>For business.</i>

02:16.336 --> 02:19.605

happened to my ana.

02:34.754 --> 02:37.156

Hey, greg.

03:19.934 --> 03:21.433
Hey.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.235
Landlord came over
to collect the month's rent

03:23.237 --> 03:25.204
From the couple
who lives here.

03:25.206 --> 03:27.973
Came across this

03:27.975 --> 03:30.809
When he looked through
the garage window.

03:34.981 --> 03:35.981
Wow.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.983
That's one hell
of a body dump.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.751
Like they were dumped
by a cement truck.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.687
Got this picture
from inside.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.623
I'm pretty sure
this is the couple.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.391
Brett and claire marsh.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.527
Someone's been doing
a lot of work in here.

03:48.529 --> 03:49.895
Sanders:
Landlord says

03:49.897 --> 03:52.531
That brett had repaired
the sewer line

03:52.533 --> 03:54.499
And was in the middle
of replacing the floor.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.768
Yeah, but concrete's
not quicksand.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.904
They couldn't have just
gotten stuck in it.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.339
No, I'm thinking

04:00.341 --> 04:01.974
That someone was trying
to bury these two.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.809
Phillips:
And the ground just

04:03.811 --> 04:06.478
Yeah, because someone
messed up the recipe.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.913
A couple of
these empty bags

04:07.915 --> 04:09.681
Are expansive mortar.
It looks like concrete,

04:09.683 --> 04:11.683
But it's actually designed
to bust up concrete.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.951
You pour it
into drilled holes

04:12.953 --> 04:14.620
And it'll grow
to such a volume

04:14.622 --> 04:15.921
That it can crack solid rock.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.489
The stuff is mistakenly

04:17.491 --> 04:18.991
<i>Mixed with the concrete,</i>

04:18.993 --> 04:22.661
<i>Gets poured on the couple,</i>

04:22.663 --> 04:25.030
<i>And then the dead shall rise.</i>

04:28.735 --> 04:30.569
Beyond bizarre.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.471
David, I can help you
chip them out

04:32.473 --> 04:33.805
For transport back
to the morgue.

04:33.807 --> 04:37.643
All right, I'll get started
processing inside the house.

04:37.645 --> 04:41.046
This is my house,
all right?!
Whoa, hey.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.581

Hold on a second.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.353

04:57.564 --> 04:59.631
I'm so sorry.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.502
Brett:

05:10.576 --> 05:11.943
My wife and my brother jeff.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.880
I was only away
in bakersfield for a night.

05:14.882 --> 05:15.914
What the hell
happened to them?

05:15.916 --> 05:17.316
You said that your brother

05:17.318 --> 05:18.717
Was doing your cement work?

05:20.019 --> 05:22.954
He needed a
place to stay.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.990
So I let him crash.

05:26.693 --> 05:29.428
And I knew he'd screw it up,

05:29.430 --> 05:32.464
The kind of guy jeff is...

05:32.466 --> 05:33.832
But I was expecting
sloppy edgework,

05:33.834 --> 05:36.635
Not...

05:36.637 --> 05:38.937
That.

05:40.973 --> 05:44.443

want to hurt your brother?

05:44.445 --> 05:45.644
Or your wife?

05:48.848 --> 05:52.351

You got me.

11:35.227 --> 11:38.329
Whoa, there's traces of cornhusk
all over this dress.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.970
Don't worry, doc, we'll find out
exactly what happened to her.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.172
I hope so.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.373
Okay?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.348
Hey.
Hey.

11:57.350 --> 12:00.385
This is definitely claire marsh
and her husband's brother jeff.

12:04.023 --> 12:06.858
Single gsws
to their heads?

12:06.860 --> 12:09.227
Through and through on his,
no exit wound on hers.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.297
Expansive mortar did
the rest of this damage.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.899
Well, finn is x-raying
the rest of the concrete now.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.801
She thought she saw
an embedded bullet,

12:16.803 --> 12:19.003
Which means they were shot
in the garage.

12:19.005 --> 12:22.006
Right beside
their shallow grave.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.308
But the concrete
expanded and shifted,

12:23.310 --> 12:25.310
So we won't be able
to determine anything

12:25.312 --> 12:26.978
About the bullet's trajectory.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.047
(sidle grunts)

12:32.118 --> 12:33.118
Greg.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.853
Look at this.

12:34.855 --> 12:35.854
A gun.

12:35.856 --> 12:36.988
Possible murder weapon?

12:36.990 --> 12:39.758
You know, I found
some antidepressants

12:39.760 --> 12:42.160
Among jeff's stuff at the house.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.429
Guy has emotional problems,
ends up with a gun in his hand?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.931
You're thinking murder-suicide.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.166
Wouldn't be
the first guy to covet

12:48.168 --> 12:49.434
His brother's wife.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.436
He wants to off himself.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.438
Decides to take her with him.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.007
So, he shoots her,
pours the concrete,

12:56.009 --> 12:58.877
And then snuggles up beside her
in the concrete.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.445
Bam.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.447
It's a possibility.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.882
Actually it's not.

13:05.017 --> 13:07.118
I found high-velocity
blood spatter

13:07.120 --> 13:09.120
On claire's clothing.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.055
Wrong side to be from her gsw.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.858
So it was his, which means she
was standing out of the concrete

13:13.860 --> 13:15.226
Next to him when he was shot.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.495
My theory-- double murder,
killer plants the gun,

13:17.497 --> 13:18.830
Buries them.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.866
Occam's razor is so dull.

13:31.011 --> 13:34.212
Doc's gathering his notes,
writing his report.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.247
We'll be out of here
first thing tomorrow.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.050
Cool. Secured some tacos
from down the street.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.585
Weapons-grade hot sauce.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.953
Thanks.

13:44.256 --> 13:46.257
So, did you read about

13:46.259 --> 13:47.492
This cartel massacre last week?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.561
Four gunned down,
one of them beheaded.

13:49.563 --> 13:51.596
I've got them
in the cooler right now.

13:51.598 --> 13:54.499
The news treats it like
it's something to celebrate.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.067
But look at these guys.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.468
Murder sells papers, amigo.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.170
Yeah, but it's
different down here.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.606
I mean, these cartel guys are
worshipped like celebrities.

14:01.608 --> 14:04.309
There's songs written
about their crimes.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.144
Sure, but wasn't vegas
founded by criminals?

14:06.146 --> 14:08.479
You guys put your
mobsters in a museum.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.215
That's history, not news.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.317
Okay, so who do you think
buys all the drugs?

14:12.319 --> 14:14.085
Place like sin city.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.887
Come do whatever you want.

14:15.889 --> 14:18.556
No cartels without customers.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.631
I think you hurt his feelings.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.132
Don't get me wrong, stokes.

14:28.134 --> 14:31.135
You hook me up with a deal
at caesars, I'm there.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.448
Something wrong, nick?

14:43.450 --> 14:47.151
These men were all slaughtered
in a cartel hit last week.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.887
That paper shows

14:48.889 --> 14:52.156
Cornhusks on the ground.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.628
It's all over them.

14:56.630 --> 14:59.898
That's the same trace that
was found on ana ortiz.

15:01.967 --> 15:03.935
Dr. Blanco?

15:03.937 --> 15:06.170
I think there's been

15:06.172 --> 15:08.606
A cross-contamination of
trace between the bodies.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.641
Bull.

15:09.643 --> 15:11.643
This place might
not be pretty,

15:11.645 --> 15:13.945
But I do my job right.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.580
I don't make mistakes like that.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.482
If that's true,
then ana ortiz

15:17.484 --> 15:19.584
Was at the same place where
those four men were murdered.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.586
We found traces of cornhusk

15:21.588 --> 15:23.254
On her body,
the same way they had it.

15:26.458 --> 15:29.394
Dr. Blanco, there's more
to her story, isn't there?

15:32.264 --> 15:34.432
I recovered those men
from the site of the massacre.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.067
Cartel property.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.136
Used to be a
cornfield.

15:38.138 --> 15:42.507
Next day, an anonymous caller
said that I left a body behind.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.642
<i>Went back out there,</i>

15:44.644 --> 15:47.345
<i>Little bit away from</i>
<i>where the other bodies fell.</i>

15:47.347 --> 15:50.248
<i>There was a girl.</i>

15:51.016 --> 15:53.217
So, you lied to us.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.687
You're here
for the girl.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.288
Not the cartel
killings.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.357
And she wasn't shot
like the other...

15:59.359 --> 16:01.659
Men, so why-why keep
digging into it?

16:01.661 --> 16:04.395
I want to see the investigative
file on that shooting right now.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.596
She died of an overdose.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.432
An overdose of cocaine.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.033
All right?

16:09.035 --> 16:10.234
So, let it be.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.003
I need to see that file.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.240
There isn't one.

16:16.242 --> 16:17.375
Oh, come on.

16:17.377 --> 16:21.612
Cartel-on-cartel crime,
nobody's looking into that.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.047
Then we will.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.549
What?
We came here

16:24.551 --> 16:26.351
To determine what happened
to ana ortiz.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.119
And by god,
that's what we're gonna do.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.321
Now, her body was found
at the scene

16:30.323 --> 16:31.723
Of that massacre,
we're gonna go

16:31.725 --> 16:33.591
Back out there,
and we're gonna process it.

16:33.593 --> 16:37.295
You want to go stand in a field
that's still bloody

16:37.297 --> 16:38.663
From the last guys
who stood there.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.031
We'd be target practice.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.100
Well, if you think
it's too dangerous...

16:42.102 --> 16:43.768
I'll go alone.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.026
(speaking in spanish)

17:08.028 --> 17:09.594
You trust these guys?

17:09.596 --> 17:12.430
Local pd was the best protection
my office could coordinate.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.665
These guys are safer
than nothing.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.734
That's debatable.

17:18.270 --> 17:19.570
So, dr. Blanco

17:19.572 --> 17:23.174
Said he found ana's body
right around here.

17:23.176 --> 17:26.744
And look at this.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.046
Same cocaine trace

17:28.048 --> 17:30.114
That was found in ana's nose.

17:32.584 --> 17:34.252
(speaking spanish)

17:35.554 --> 17:37.288
Tire treads.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.158
Looks like they came to a stop

17:40.160 --> 17:41.459
Right here.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.094
Silva:
18-wheeler.

17:45.831 --> 17:49.434
Javier, there's flakes of blood
in these treads.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.437
The truck drove through
the blood from the massacre.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.838
(gunfire)

17:53.840 --> 17:56.507
That's what I'm thinking.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.377
(policemen speaking spanish)

18:03.549 --> 18:04.649
Who the hell is that?

18:04.651 --> 18:07.552
<i>¿quien es ese, señor?</i>

18:13.225 --> 18:14.725
Be ready.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.566
(gun clicks)

18:24.369 --> 18:27.705
(speaking spanish)

18:33.712 --> 18:35.646
What was that?
Said he heard
we were investigating

18:35.648 --> 18:40.318
So why the hell are we poking
around the blood of the cartel?

18:46.558 --> 18:48.559
Right.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.695
You know,
the way the blood

18:50.697 --> 18:52.830
Is flaked in these treads
tells me this blood pool

18:52.832 --> 18:54.732
Was dry when the truck drove
through it,

18:54.734 --> 18:57.168
And that was at least
a couple hours

18:57.170 --> 18:58.536
After the massacre.

18:58.538 --> 19:02.340
It stopped right there,
and it dumped ana's body

19:02.342 --> 19:03.908
Right over there.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.744
Fascinating.
Can we get the hell out of here?

19:07.880 --> 19:10.148
Yeah, let's go.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.600
♪

19:42.848 --> 19:44.315
Hey.
Hey.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.516
Just finished processing

19:45.518 --> 19:47.818
The concrete couple's
clothes.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.721
That was kind of a sexy little
dress she had on there.

19:50.723 --> 19:54.325
Nice shoes, too,
although the, uh, soles had

19:54.327 --> 19:56.394
Speckles of paint on them.
Well, I have

19:56.396 --> 19:58.529
A bullet and I have a gun,

19:58.531 --> 19:59.931
But I have no way
to fire it

19:59.933 --> 20:01.599
To make a comparison,
because the gun barrel

20:01.601 --> 20:04.435
Is split like a banana peel.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.704
The expansive mortar got in it.
Yeah.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.306
So I've tried
something different.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.308
I've microsiled
the inside

20:10.310 --> 20:12.577
Of the barrel.
That works?

20:17.883 --> 20:20.351
Yes, it does.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.361
It's a match.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.495
We've got our murder weapon.

20:31.497 --> 20:33.564
The killer left it
in the vic's hand.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.366
Oh, I also found
an errant hair

20:35.368 --> 20:38.502
In the cement.
Henry ran dna on it.

20:38.504 --> 20:41.005
Did not match either one
of our victims, so...

20:41.007 --> 20:43.474
Hopefully could
be the killer's.

20:45.611 --> 20:48.246
I can smell the health code
violations in that place

20:48.248 --> 20:49.914
From here, doc.
Robbins:
Hodges...

20:49.916 --> 20:52.850
Promise me I can't get a staph
infection through the internet.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.386
Hodges, the tox reports, please.

20:55.388 --> 20:59.490
Right. I ran a full drug screen
on the sample of heart blood

20:59.492 --> 21:00.625
You sent.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.827
Ana ortiz was completely clean.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.929
Robbins:
Well, that makes
no sense.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.965
Cocaine was collected
from inside her nostrils.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.433
Well, then she
must have exercised

21:09.435 --> 21:11.435
Remarkable nasal restraint.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.004
Don't know what else
I can tell you.

21:13.006 --> 21:16.474
Definitely see some mold spores
up in that corner

21:16.476 --> 21:18.843
Of the ceiling over there.
Hodges, uh, we're
starting to lose connection.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.011
Thank you, hodges.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.746
Whoa, wait a...

21:21.748 --> 21:24.982
(sighs) uh, dr. Blanco, may I
use one of your microscopes?

21:24.984 --> 21:27.318
Should I check it for
health code violations?

21:27.320 --> 21:29.620
That man is a hypochondriac

21:29.622 --> 21:32.657
And a lunatic, and I apologize.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.029
Thank you.

21:38.031 --> 21:39.563
So what are
you thinking?

21:39.565 --> 21:43.567
Now, with a drug overdose
eliminated,

21:43.569 --> 21:47.772
Other explanation
for ana's symptoms is poisoning.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.373
Look at that.

21:50.842 --> 21:54.345
Blanco:
Alternating dark bands
near the root.

21:54.347 --> 21:55.780
Heavy metal poisoning?

21:55.782 --> 21:57.515
Certainly appears
that way.

21:57.517 --> 21:58.916
Seen my share of that.

22:00.519 --> 22:02.853
As a young coroner, this area

22:02.855 --> 22:05.656
Was full
of industrial pollution.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.459
Factories were no better
than the cartels.

22:09.761 --> 22:11.329
They left babies
on my table.

22:15.367 --> 22:16.500
Oh, yeah. Mees' lines.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.069
Consistent with
heavy metal poisoning.

22:18.071 --> 22:20.538
It could also explain
the frostbite on her feet.

22:20.540 --> 22:23.774
Toxic metals can cause
peripheral neuropathy,
yeah.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.376
Make one's feet feel
like they're burning.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.911
She may have been icing them.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.847
So the question is,
how was she poisoned

22:29.849 --> 22:33.384
And why did she end up
at that massacre site?

22:33.386 --> 22:35.886
She was dumped there
by a semi truck,

22:35.888 --> 22:37.521
Hours after the shooting.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.690
Well, nick, I'll match
and raise your discovery.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.393
Ana ortiz didn't have
any drugs in her system.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.729
Not an overdose.
Heavy metal poisoning.

22:44.731 --> 22:45.930
Wait a minute, now.

22:45.932 --> 22:48.632
Then what is this stuff?

22:48.634 --> 22:50.034
I was hoping you'd
figure that out.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.603
Okay.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.839
Is that your water, doctor?

23:02.748 --> 23:04.382
Doesn't dissolve in water.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.450
Not cocaine.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.658
This is pulverized plastic.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.627
They melt it
down and use it

23:16.629 --> 23:18.829
To make milk jugs,
stuff like that.

23:18.831 --> 23:21.399
So how did it
get on ana ortiz?

23:21.401 --> 23:23.901
Any, uh, plastics production
around here?

23:23.903 --> 23:25.669
There's a plant outside of town.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.538
Robbins:
Well, the fact that ana
had it in her nose

23:27.540 --> 23:30.574
And her hair suggests
she was around a lot of it.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.410
Maybe buried in it.
Semi could've come

23:32.412 --> 23:33.911
From that plant.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.646
I got to get out there,

23:35.648 --> 23:36.947
Check out those
trucking records.

23:36.949 --> 23:40.418
That plant-- like much
around here-- is infected.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.087
Ties to cartel trafficking
and money laundering.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.589
They're not gonna be happy
to see you there, my friend.

23:45.591 --> 23:46.757
I don't care.

23:46.759 --> 23:47.925
What did I miss?

23:47.927 --> 23:49.727
Hey, grab your stuff.

23:49.729 --> 23:50.961
We're going on
another field trip.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.563
<i>¿otra vez?</i>

23:52.565 --> 23:53.964
Yippie ki-yay.

23:57.569 --> 24:00.438
Sanders:
The concrete the killer
poured all over

24:00.440 --> 24:02.440
Your wife
and brother's bodies...

24:02.442 --> 24:03.974
We crushed it all up.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.544
Found this hair.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.812
It's yours.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.849
The hair must have been
in the mixer from before.

24:11.851 --> 24:15.152
Do you, uh, have
receipts from your trip,

24:15.154 --> 24:17.488
To show that you were
in bakersfield all night?

24:17.490 --> 24:20.991
Why the hell would I kill
my own wife and brother?

24:20.993 --> 24:24.495
Your wife was wearing a pretty
revealing outfit when she died.

24:24.497 --> 24:28.866
So?
So... Your brother, alone
in the house with your wife.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.769
You head out of town,
come home early,

24:31.771 --> 24:33.237
Catch them in the middle
of something.

24:33.239 --> 24:36.207
What kind of slapstick porno
are you living in, pal?

24:36.209 --> 24:38.542
My wife, with jeff?

24:38.544 --> 24:40.845
My wife had the
house fumigated

24:40.847 --> 24:42.713
After jeff visited for
christmas last year.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.181
She looked at him
like he was an ape.

24:44.183 --> 24:47.084
Claire with jeff?

24:47.086 --> 24:49.086
Not in a million lifetimes.

24:50.555 --> 24:52.857
I'll get you those
receipts from my trip.

24:52.859 --> 24:56.894
But tell me you guys are working
on some real leads, too, right?

24:58.763 --> 25:00.164
That's the plastic company's
trucking records

25:00.166 --> 25:01.632
For the last two weeks.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.634
How'd you
get that?
Slipped some cash

25:03.636 --> 25:04.635
To an office clerk.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.003
I mean, you were
right, dr. B.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.038
They're into a lot more
than just plastic over there.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.907
A lot of firepower.
I mean, who needs

25:09.909 --> 25:11.909
An m-16 to guard milk jugs,
you know what I mean?

25:11.911 --> 25:15.846
Pulverized plastics
when ana ortiz was dumped.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.515
On the ground.

25:17.517 --> 25:18.983
<i>En el piso.</i>

25:18.985 --> 25:20.918
Get back, get
back, guys.
<i>Somos policía.</i>

25:20.920 --> 25:22.152
<i>¿qué pasó?</i>

25:22.154 --> 25:23.954
Nick:
What's going on?

25:23.956 --> 25:25.956
(officers yelling in spanish)

25:28.293 --> 25:30.127
Whoa!
Oh!

25:30.129 --> 25:31.662
Javier silva.
You're under arrest

25:31.664 --> 25:32.796
For the murder of ana ortiz.

25:32.798 --> 25:34.932
<i>¿qué?</i>
<i>What?</i>

25:34.934 --> 25:36.300
That's crazy, man.
Who-who sent you guys

25:36.302 --> 25:38.903
Down here, huh?
Who told you to come do this?

25:38.905 --> 25:41.071
Hey!

25:41.073 --> 25:42.907
Hey.

25:42.909 --> 25:45.142
It's gonna be
all right, javier.

25:55.187 --> 25:59.223
I mean, we're under house ar...
Well, morgue arrest.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.891
But we're fine.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.293
Brass:
Well, I'm here with
representatives

26:02.295 --> 26:03.727
Of the state department.

26:03.729 --> 26:06.597
We're going to extricate you
and the doc asap.

26:06.599 --> 26:09.266
The arquero police department
has the two of you

26:09.268 --> 26:13.237
In the death ana ortiz.
You got to be
kidding me. Really?

26:13.239 --> 26:15.873
The investigation obviously
stepped on the wrong

26:15.875 --> 26:17.708
Snakeskin boots.
Well, I'm worried about

26:17.710 --> 26:19.710
How they're taking it
out on agent silva.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.745
There's no word from
him yet, is there?

26:21.747 --> 26:23.013
Nada. That's a negative.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.114
But hang tight, nicky.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.849
We'll get you out of there.
Okay.

26:25.851 --> 26:28.252
(phone clicks off)
well...

26:28.254 --> 26:29.920
How you guys feeling?

26:29.922 --> 26:32.022
Splendid.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.123
I love visitors.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.259
Robbins:
Listen, the best way

26:35.261 --> 26:38.596
We can help
agent silva...

26:38.598 --> 26:41.065
Is to find out exactly

26:41.067 --> 26:43.000
What happened to ana ortiz.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.935
The trucking
records.

26:46.104 --> 26:48.072
I'll entertain the company.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.615
You think ana
came down here,

26:57.617 --> 27:00.250
Crossed paths
with the cartel somehow,

27:00.252 --> 27:03.253
And they had one of their
truckers dispose of her body?

27:12.931 --> 27:16.266
Hey, doc, I'm not so sure that
trouble found her down here.

27:17.736 --> 27:19.770
I think that trouble
found her in las vegas.

27:19.772 --> 27:22.039
Take a look at this
trucker, right here.

27:22.041 --> 27:25.643
Now, he's from arquero,
but he has a regular route

27:25.645 --> 27:27.344
Between here and las vegas.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.213
He was in las vegas
eight days ago.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.015
When ana went missing.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.216
That's right.

27:38.957 --> 27:40.190
Hey, jim,

27:40.192 --> 27:42.092
It's nick again. Listen,
I think I have someone

27:42.094 --> 27:44.695
You guys should look into.

27:46.865 --> 27:49.767
How we doing with
nick's trucker suspect?

27:49.769 --> 27:52.736
Well, the vegas plastics
company's been cooperative.

27:52.738 --> 27:55.239
Given us some good information
on mateo garcia's truck

27:55.241 --> 27:56.674
And his schedule.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.942
He is on his way
to las vegas right now

27:58.944 --> 28:00.444
To pick up his
regular shipment.

28:00.446 --> 28:03.113
Should be in las
vegas by breakfast.

28:03.115 --> 28:04.214
And brass will pick him up.

28:04.216 --> 28:06.316
Okay, thanks.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.019
I really appreciate your
concern, david, but we're fine.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.789
Are you sure?
I-I'll call my dad's

28:11.791 --> 28:13.157
Air force buddies.
Some of those guys

28:13.159 --> 28:14.792
Are crazy enough
to come get you.

28:14.794 --> 28:19.897
Hey, I, uh... I heard about
the concrete couple.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.065
How did their autopsies go?

28:21.067 --> 28:23.267
You're checking up on my work?

28:23.269 --> 28:25.269
Of course not.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.937
I'm just killing some time.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.473
Oh. Okay, well,
let's take a look.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.475
Nothing surprising on him.

28:31.477 --> 28:35.813
C.O.D. Is a gunshot wound
to the temple.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.081
Big exit wound, though.

28:37.083 --> 28:41.218
But with her, things are
a bit more complicated.

28:43.388 --> 28:46.256
That hole in her head
would be my guess.

28:46.258 --> 28:47.491
Thank you, dr. Blanco.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.393
And you are right.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.395
C.O.D. Is the gunshot wound.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.330
But...

28:53.332 --> 28:56.366
There are other factors.

28:56.368 --> 28:59.036
Extensive damage to the liver
and the kidneys.

28:59.038 --> 29:01.872
And, doc,

29:01.874 --> 29:03.373
I took a look at her hair

29:03.375 --> 29:05.976
And I saw alternating
dark bands.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.414
Check her fingernails, david.

29:10.416 --> 29:11.515
Gotcha.

29:11.517 --> 29:14.284
False nails.

29:14.286 --> 29:15.819
One's missing.

29:15.821 --> 29:17.755
I'll see if I can
scrape off the glue.

29:17.757 --> 29:18.889
Good.

29:22.393 --> 29:24.027
Mees' lines.

29:24.029 --> 29:25.529
Heavy metal poisoning?

29:25.531 --> 29:27.831
(exhales)
go to the scope.

29:27.833 --> 29:30.434
Get measurements
on the dark bands

29:30.436 --> 29:31.769
In her hair.

29:31.771 --> 29:33.504
Absolutely.

29:35.840 --> 29:36.974
Two bands,

29:36.976 --> 29:39.376
Half a millimeter wide.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.411
And a half a millimeter apart.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.947
Poisoned on
alternating days.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.115
Same pattern
as ana ortiz.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.117
David, two women
from vegas

29:47.119 --> 29:49.052
Poisoned the same way--
that can't be coincidence.

29:49.054 --> 29:51.989
You went all the way
down to mexico

29:51.991 --> 29:55.392
And we're working
on the same case.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.161
Brass:
So you got her
in your truck,

29:57.163 --> 29:58.562
And you took
her for a ride,

29:58.564 --> 29:59.963
Isn't that right, mateo?

29:59.965 --> 30:01.832
I have no idea
what happened to her.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.200
Well, let me jog
your memory, okay?

30:03.202 --> 30:05.169
You're on a long haul,
you're a lonely guy.

30:05.171 --> 30:08.105
You see a beautiful
girl in vegas.
You pick her up.

30:08.107 --> 30:11.275
Maybe she'll accompany
you on your trip
to arquero, right?

30:11.277 --> 30:13.443
No.
We know that you
drove her down there.

30:13.445 --> 30:18.182
All right? I loaded
my truck at the vegas plant.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.517
20 drums of pulverized plastic.
Mm-hmm.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.352
Drove it down
to arquero.
Okay.

30:22.354 --> 30:24.221
Straight through,
no stops.

30:24.223 --> 30:27.491
When I got there,
I started unloading.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.561
One of the drums felt...
Too heavy.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.996
She was inside.

30:32.998 --> 30:33.997
<i>Muerta.</i>

30:33.999 --> 30:35.532
<i>Muerta.</i>

30:35.534 --> 30:37.501
And how did she
end up like that?

30:37.503 --> 30:38.936
<i>Yo no sé.</i>

30:38.938 --> 30:41.171
But I called
the arquero police.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.540
They wanted nothing to do
with a dead american girl.

30:43.542 --> 30:46.977
So you dumped this
poor girl's body

30:46.979 --> 30:49.012
Like a piece of
road trip trash

30:49.014 --> 30:50.547
In a field?

30:50.549 --> 30:52.216
Señor,

30:52.218 --> 30:55.986
I could have made it so that
nobody ever saw her again.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.555
But I wanted the girl,

30:58.557 --> 31:00.591
<i>Y su familia,</i>

31:00.593 --> 31:02.426
To get a chance
to get some answers.

31:02.428 --> 31:05.529
So I hear about
the cartel massacre,

31:05.531 --> 31:08.532
And I took the girl
to that field.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.869
And then you told the
coroner he missed one.

31:11.871 --> 31:15.606
Whatever happened
to that poor girl,

31:15.608 --> 31:18.108
It happened up here.

31:18.110 --> 31:20.277
Brody:
<i>So brass thinks</i>
<i>that the truck driver</i>

31:20.279 --> 31:24.147
Was just an unwitting
transporter of ana ortiz's body?

31:24.149 --> 31:25.883
Well, tox says
both ana and claire

31:25.885 --> 31:27.084
Were poisoned by thallium.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.652
Same pattern of dosing.

31:28.654 --> 31:31.521
So it has to be the
same poison suspect.

31:31.523 --> 31:35.025
Whoever that is must have dumped
ana ortiz's body in the barrel

31:35.027 --> 31:36.994
At the las vegas
plastics facility.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.496
And then moved on
to their next victim.

31:39.498 --> 31:42.366
All right, so hair analysis
shows that claire's poisoning

31:42.368 --> 31:45.302
Began four days after
ana's body was dumped.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.037
But before the poison had
the chance to kill claire,

31:47.039 --> 31:49.573
She was gunned down
along with her jeff marsh.

31:49.575 --> 31:52.676
Yeah, I feel like
the killer panicked,

31:52.678 --> 31:55.379
Like he couldn't wait
for the poison to do its job.

31:55.381 --> 31:58.181
Ana's disappearance was
getting a lot of attention.

31:58.183 --> 31:59.983
It might have put
pressure on him.

31:59.985 --> 32:02.653
You know, ana and claire
have the same killer.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.521
So what else do they
have in common?

32:04.523 --> 32:06.690
Any overlap
in their life could be

32:06.692 --> 32:09.059
Where they crossed paths
with their assailant.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.627
Well, ana's 18,

32:10.629 --> 32:12.262
Child of privilege.

32:12.264 --> 32:15.098
Claire is 15 years older,
scraping by

32:15.100 --> 32:17.534
On temp receptionist
jobs around town.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.102
And they lived
in different neighborhoods.

32:19.104 --> 32:21.138
No apparent
family connection.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.073
You guys, tip just
came in from pd.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.975
A friend of claire's
heard about her murder,

32:24.977 --> 32:26.476
And thought this
could be a lead.

32:26.478 --> 32:29.112
Claire texted her
this photo three days ago.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.114
"ready for a visit
with my artiste."

32:31.116 --> 32:34.217
Friend said claire didn't
give her any details,

32:34.219 --> 32:37.688
But, morgan, you found trace of
paint on claire's shoes, right?

32:37.690 --> 32:40.390
It could be that claire
had contact with this artiste

32:40.392 --> 32:42.025
Around the time of her death.

32:42.027 --> 32:43.694
Anything that can help solve
claire's case

32:43.696 --> 32:45.228
Can help solve ana's.

32:45.230 --> 32:46.663
Where was
the photo taken?

32:46.665 --> 32:48.398
Henry just analyzed
the metadata.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.667
Picture was snapped at a house
in henderson.

32:50.669 --> 32:52.536
Want to check it out?

32:52.538 --> 32:54.304
Lvpd!

33:00.311 --> 33:04.348
Elderly homeowner leases out
the guesthouse to a guy.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.683
Uses it as his
studio, pays cash.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.652
All clear.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.520
You got a name?

33:10.522 --> 33:13.590
No, she swears she
wrote it down somewhere.

33:22.433 --> 33:24.534
♪

33:53.698 --> 33:55.665
Ana ortiz.

34:00.538 --> 34:02.372
Claire marsh.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.574
Lifelike.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.643
For the last time.

34:15.820 --> 34:18.221
It's a shame the artist
didn't sign his work.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.690
Didn't leave
any indication of who he is.

34:20.692 --> 34:24.461
You know, claire was wearing
that dress when she was shot.

34:24.463 --> 34:27.364
<i>Maybe she was here</i>
<i>shortly before, posing.</i>

34:29.400 --> 34:30.801
Whoa.

34:32.370 --> 34:34.638
Got some broken glass.

34:38.309 --> 34:41.111
Red wine with trace
of something in it.

34:43.614 --> 34:46.616
Got some personal letters here.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.253
Green flame.

34:50.255 --> 34:52.222
It's thallium.

34:52.224 --> 34:54.191
He hid the poison in the wine.

34:55.626 --> 34:58.495
Sanders:
<i>Tastelsess, odorless.</i>

34:58.497 --> 35:01.264
The victims had no idea.

35:02.867 --> 35:06.837
Greg, one of these
is from ana ortiz.

35:06.839 --> 35:09.773
"my love,
I can't be yours forever.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.341
"you're capturing me
in your work,

35:11.343 --> 35:13.477
And that will have
to be enough for now."

35:13.479 --> 35:14.845
She was pulling away from him.

35:14.847 --> 35:17.247
But he wasn't going
to let that happen.

35:17.249 --> 35:20.250
He poisoned her to weaken her,
make her sick,

35:20.252 --> 35:22.219
Dependent on him so
she couldn't leave,

35:22.221 --> 35:23.620
But he pushed
it too far.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.790
When a sadist kills a plaything,
he needs a replacement.

35:26.792 --> 35:29.292
A new victim to control.
Claire.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.301
Hey.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.637
Claire was missing
an acrylic fingernail.

35:40.639 --> 35:43.440
Here it is.

35:44.842 --> 35:47.677
You know, ana was
all over the news.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.880
Claire might have
recognized her.

35:49.882 --> 35:52.716
Sidle:
<i>She was holding</i>
<i>a portrait of ana...</i>

35:52.718 --> 35:56.753
<i>Then the artist yanked it away</i>
<i>from her.</i>

35:56.755 --> 35:58.788
Sanders:
<i>She realized he was bad news.</i>

35:58.790 --> 36:01.925
Sidle:
<i>He follows her home</i>
<i>to silence her.</i>

36:01.927 --> 36:04.327
Brother-in-law had the bad luck
<i>of being there.</i>

36:08.799 --> 36:11.201
Claire was gonna be an artist
before we met.

36:11.203 --> 36:12.502
Still had some friends
from back then.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.938
One of the guys--
she used to model for him.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.940
I told her I didn't
want to hear about it.
Well, I want to hear about it.

36:16.942 --> 36:18.942
So, this dude's the killer,
you're saying?

36:18.944 --> 36:20.544
It's just someone
we want to talk to.

36:20.546 --> 36:21.811
What's his name?

36:21.813 --> 36:23.413
I don't remember.

36:23.415 --> 36:24.648
You don't remember?
No!

36:24.650 --> 36:26.550
I wasn't interested
in hearing about some guy,

36:26.552 --> 36:30.253
Sat there staring at my wife
with his brush in his hand.

36:31.422 --> 36:33.490
If I knew his name,
I'd tell you.

36:33.492 --> 36:34.791
Russell:
<i>We found some letters</i>

36:34.793 --> 36:37.194
That ana wrote
that lead us to believe

36:37.196 --> 36:40.964
That the artist who painted this
was in a relationship

36:40.966 --> 36:43.266
With your daughter.

36:43.268 --> 36:45.268
Why would ana keep
that from me?
Well, I don't know.

36:45.270 --> 36:46.970
I don't know.
Maybe he was an older man.

36:46.972 --> 36:51.541
Somebody who could manipulate
her into keeping a secret.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.977
This is the person
who hurt her.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.979
Yeah, look, there's one
other thing, sir.

36:55.981 --> 36:59.983
My... My csis found
a trucking manifest.

36:59.985 --> 37:03.320
Ana's body was found
in a barrel

37:03.322 --> 37:05.989
That belonged to a company
here in las vegas.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.757
A partell manufacturing.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.526
What?

37:09.528 --> 37:11.728
We checked
the employment records,

37:11.730 --> 37:14.998
And the other victim,
claire marsh, worked for partell

37:15.000 --> 37:18.568
Recently for a few days
as a temporary receptionist.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.503
We've also discovered that...

37:20.505 --> 37:22.739
You're on the board
of... Of that company.

37:22.741 --> 37:26.343
I hope you're not implying that
I had something to do with it.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.877
Absolutely not.

37:27.879 --> 37:31.348
But the fact that your daughter
and another woman

37:31.350 --> 37:33.350
Who was employed by a company

37:33.352 --> 37:36.019
That at least you're involved
with, were both victims...

37:36.021 --> 37:37.687
You know, I was just hoping

37:37.689 --> 37:39.889
You could help us
connect the dots.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.691
That's all.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.293
You know anyone like that?

37:43.295 --> 37:45.762
I mean, who... Who would be
capable of such a thing?

37:46.998 --> 37:48.999
Nobody.

37:51.335 --> 37:52.636
So, if we're done...

37:52.638 --> 37:54.738
I think I need
to go rest now.

37:55.706 --> 37:57.607
You can see yourself out.

38:02.046 --> 38:04.047
Sidle:
<i>Russell?</i>

38:04.049 --> 38:06.516
I checked with partell
manufacturing hr,

38:06.518 --> 38:09.686
Any chance they have an employee
who also is a known artist.

38:09.688 --> 38:11.688
Turns out they just
commissioned a mural

38:11.690 --> 38:13.290
In their cafeteria.

38:13.292 --> 38:14.758
Artist's name is
keith garner.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.726
He worked on it
late at night,

38:16.728 --> 38:19.496
Because he's also
got a day job.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.564
Garner's day job is an

38:21.566 --> 38:23.500
Art teacher,
ana ortiz's high school.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.935
Guess where he taught
15 years ago.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.537
Claire marsh's high school.

38:27.539 --> 38:29.472
He knew both our victims
as young students.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.007
<i>He also attended ana's wake.</i>

38:31.009 --> 38:32.676
She will not be forgotten.

38:32.678 --> 38:35.045
He must have bumped into
claire again at the factory,

38:35.047 --> 38:38.014
And invited her back to
his studio as a kind of--

38:38.016 --> 38:40.383
I don't know--
replacement for ana.

38:40.385 --> 38:41.818
Brass is on his way
to garner's residence.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.386
I requested a ping
on his cell

38:43.388 --> 38:45.488
And a broadcast
on his vehicle.

38:45.490 --> 38:46.589
Hey, look at that.

38:46.591 --> 38:48.858
Ping came back on
garner's cell phone.

38:51.028 --> 38:52.762
Look where he is.

38:54.399 --> 38:58.335
Gabriel:
I never should have let ana
convince me to hire you!

38:58.337 --> 38:59.569
(coughing)
I'm so sorry.

38:59.571 --> 39:01.037
That I didn't
protect you, ana.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.073
(wheezes, coughs)
that I didn't see...

39:03.075 --> 39:06.042
What this son of a bitch
was doing to you!

39:07.445 --> 39:10.580
No! You don't look at her!

39:10.582 --> 39:11.948
She was mine.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.983
I loved her.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.885
I just wanted to keep her.

39:16.721 --> 39:18.121
I just wanted her to need me.

39:18.123 --> 39:20.023
Shut up!
She loved me.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.591
(grunting)

39:21.593 --> 39:23.460
Lvpd!
Put the gun down!

39:23.462 --> 39:25.362
Gabriel. All right,
all right, hey.

39:25.364 --> 39:27.130
Just relax. Everybody
just take a second here.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.131
You don't want to do this.

39:28.133 --> 39:29.132
Just put...

39:29.134 --> 39:30.467
Put the weapon
down, all right?

39:30.469 --> 39:32.869
He killed her.
He killed my baby girl.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.604
All right, now, hey, hey,
don't do that. No, no.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.773
Don't you dare.
Don't you dare.
(gun chamber cocking)

39:36.775 --> 39:38.908
All right, everybody relax
just for a second.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.143
He took her from me!

39:40.145 --> 39:41.478
I know, all right, all right.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.479
Just-just listen to me

39:42.481 --> 39:43.880
For one second.

39:43.882 --> 39:47.117
You can still hear
ana's voice, can't you?

39:47.119 --> 39:49.085
What is she telling you
to do right now?

39:52.490 --> 39:55.492
(crying)

39:55.494 --> 39:57.660
(sobbing)

40:03.734 --> 40:05.635
(groans)

40:05.637 --> 40:07.170
(crying)

40:09.039 --> 40:11.641
He took her.
All right.

40:11.643 --> 40:15.478
Just give me a minute
here, will you?

40:15.480 --> 40:17.046
My daughter.
You did the
right thing.

40:17.048 --> 40:20.950
Your daughter would be
proud of you, gabriel.

40:31.829 --> 40:33.897
(sniffing)

40:36.934 --> 40:38.701
(laughs)

40:38.703 --> 40:40.036
I thought you and stokes took

40:40.038 --> 40:41.538
The first flight out
this morning.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.173
Oh, we decided to
take a later one.

40:43.175 --> 40:45.041
I went to the police
chief's office,

40:45.043 --> 40:48.645
And I told him how sorry we were
for invading his lovely city

40:48.647 --> 40:51.181
When the real killer was
a homegrown american monster.

40:51.183 --> 40:52.949
(laughs)

40:52.951 --> 40:55.552
You told him that?
Yeah, and

40:55.554 --> 40:58.521
I asked him to release agent
silva from jail, and it worked.

40:58.523 --> 41:00.056
Silva's a free man.

41:04.094 --> 41:06.162
<i>Gracias.</i>

41:06.164 --> 41:07.964
Thank you for
everything, nick.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.466
You, too, agent silva.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.701
And, listen, if you're ever
headed vegas way,

41:11.703 --> 41:13.703
You got to look me up,
all right?

41:13.705 --> 41:15.472
Will do.
Okay.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.907
But keep your crazy gambles to
the casinos for a while, hey?

41:17.909 --> 41:20.043
I'll try.

41:25.916 --> 41:28.017
<i>Vamos.</i>

41:28.019 --> 41:30.186
Stokes:
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

41:32.656 --> 41:35.558
You took a big risk...
Sticking around,

41:35.560 --> 41:38.161
Going to meet
that police chief. (laughs)

41:38.163 --> 41:40.096
He's a dangerous man.

41:40.098 --> 41:42.699
It was the right thing to do.

41:42.701 --> 41:46.069
Which is something you don't
see too much of around here.

41:48.772 --> 41:50.807
I want you to have these tools.

41:50.809 --> 41:53.810
I realize you have a horrible
amount of use for them.

41:53.812 --> 41:55.912
<i>Gracias.</i>

41:55.914 --> 41:58.147
I really wish
I could do more to help,

41:58.149 --> 42:00.717
But I know
wishing's pretty useless.

42:00.719 --> 42:02.719
It's not useless.

42:02.721 --> 42:04.220
It's faith.

42:04.222 --> 42:06.289
<i>La fe.</i>
<i>(laughs)</i>

42:06.291 --> 42:08.525
We all need faith.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.765
<i>Vaya con dios, amigo.</i>

42:15.767 --> 42:17.767
<i>Vaya con dios, amigo.</i>

42:17.769 --> 42:19.202
