01:29.900 --> 01:31.700
Reaching in, lifting...

01:34.800 --> 01:35.400
He's breathing.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.300
Ambulance will be here in ten minutes.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.400
Okay, we don't have that long.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.200
All right, who's got an suv?

01:44.100 --> 01:45.400
Straight back, straight back.

01:46.700 --> 01:47.400
Smooth and steady.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.100

01:59.000 --> 01:59.900

02:05.500 --> 02:07.500
Got his pulse back and opened his airway.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.400
Did you really use gym bags for immobilization?

02:09.500 --> 02:12.100
Yeah, i can't wait to tell him
Some sweaty boxers saved his neck.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.300

02:18.800 --> 02:21.200
Draw up 5 of versed and 150 of sucks.

In 68-year-old with a stemi.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.100

We have mr. Gardener over here.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.400

-yes.

02:33.700 --> 02:34.700
All right,i'll be right there.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.400
Oh, mr. Gardener is a friend?

02:37.100 --> 02:39.100
We don't keep friends waiting,dr. Lawson.

02:40.300 --> 02:41.800
Okay, let's have a look then.

02:42.100 --> 02:42.600
Tube him.

02:42.700 --> 02:43.400
Got it, hank.

02:45.300 --> 02:46.000
All right, guys.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.300
Let's get him to the cath lab.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.300
Let's go, let's go.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.900
Prep nitro drip and titrate to pain.

02:51.500 --> 02:52.600
I'll get started on the cath.

02:52.700 --> 02:55.100
Type and screen him for two units packed cells.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.700
Going for the femoral artery.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.000
Threading femoral artery.

03:05.800 --> 03:06.800
No obstruction.

03:11.400 --> 03:16.700
Eight french catheter over the wire
With dilator and into the femoral artery.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.400
And there's the blockage.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.400
You can finish up.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.600
-i'm gonna go out.
-??

03:25.200 --> 03:25.900
He's stable.

03:26.000 --> 03:26.900
He just needs an angio.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.000
Dr. Wolf, how's the kid?

03:29.300 --> 03:31.600
The ekg shows a third-degree av block.

03:31.700 --> 03:32.700
He's unresponsive to meds.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.700
I placed an external pacer
But i'm not getting capture.

03:34.800 --> 03:35.400
What's his bp?

03:35.600 --> 03:36.900
Hovering around 60 systolic.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.100
All right, he needs a wire stat.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.700
The priority is mr. Gardener.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.500
You'll see him all the way through.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.200
Gardener is stable.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.200
His bp is up.

03:45.300 --> 03:47.000
His sat is 98% on two liters.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.300
The st segments are
Normalizing and his pain is gone.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.400
So how about today we
Save two for the price of one?

03:52.700 --> 03:53.400
Let's go.

03:54.000 --> 03:54.600
Dr. Lawson.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.500
Dr. Lawson!

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000

04:08.300 --> 04:11.300

04:12.000 --> 04:22.000
<font color="#ffff00">sync:frs@Ð¡¸£ luscinia wydsai</font>

04:27.700 --> 04:28.600
Wow.

04:28.900 --> 04:29.700
Thanks.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.900
After a long day of life and death,

04:32.000 --> 04:36.200
There is nothing more reassuring than the
Sight of the world's most beautiful girl.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.500
If i had a nickel.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.500
Come here.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Settle down, dr. Desperate.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.900
I know that look in your eyes.

04:44.700 --> 04:47.200
Usually leads to skipping a meal.

04:49.700 --> 04:50.300
Hmm.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.600
We skip apps and dessert.

04:52.700 --> 04:54.500
We order apps with the entrees.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.300
Cold apps only,no blackberries.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.500
Done and done.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.200
All right, decide now so i can get the check.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.700
You don't own this body yet.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.000
But i nailed the down payment, right?

05:10.500 --> 05:11.300
Yeah, you did.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.700
Let's go give that long day of yours a happy ending.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.800
* come here, pretty *

05:34.900 --> 05:37.700
* i've got a way to mess you up *

05:37.800 --> 05:40.400
* i'll tell you something *

05:42.000 --> 05:44.800
* to make you feel like you're in love *

05:44.900 --> 05:47.200
* i'll find a way *

05:48.800 --> 05:51.900
* make you what i want you to be *

05:52.000 --> 05:56.600
* and i'll be sure when you close your eyes...*

05:56.700 --> 05:58.100
I have a confession to make.

06:00.900 --> 06:02.500
I will hear your confession.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.500
I always wanted to marry a doctor.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.100
Everything seems to be falling into place for me.

06:12.100 --> 06:12.800
For us.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.800
Maybe life is supposed to go according to plan.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.000
Yeah, man plans, god laughs.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.200
Don't you think that every day for
Us is better than the one before it?

06:28.700 --> 06:30.600
The ones that end like this.

06:33.700 --> 06:34.500
Mm.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.000
I'm not--

06:38.700 --> 06:39.700
Mm, hank.

06:41.000 --> 06:41.600
No.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.000
Dr. Lawson.

06:45.700 --> 06:46.300
All right.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.100
Yeah, hello.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.200
I recognized mr. Gardener's level of blockage.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.700
I knew it had to be relieved.

07:07.800 --> 07:12.700
And i was confident he would
Be successfully angioplastied and survive...

07:13.300 --> 07:15.200
Barring any bad luck.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.400
Well, bad luck rained and poured, didn't it?

07:17.900 --> 07:20.600
While you had our senior
Ct surgeon in another room.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.900
To help me try to rescue a crashing patient.

07:23.500 --> 07:24.600
I made a judgment call.

07:24.900 --> 07:25.900
You made a mistake.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.200
A fatal one.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.600
And it's a shame,dr. Lawson,

07:28.900 --> 07:32.700
Because we all know you're the most talented
Physician this emergency department has seen.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.600
And your star was only on the rise.

07:36.200 --> 07:36.900
"was?"

07:37.400 --> 07:39.000
If i were you,i'd find a good lawyer

07:39.100 --> 07:41.800
And a great place to hide for the next 25 years.

07:42.100 --> 07:43.800
Maybe by then you'll be completely forgotten

07:43.900 --> 07:45.700
And you can come back and try again.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.800
* i'm not feeling all right today *

08:11.800 --> 08:13.700
* i'm not feeling that great *

08:42.500 --> 08:43.900
Hey, dad.

08:47.800 --> 08:48.900
You wanna have a catch?

08:52.200 --> 08:53.000
I'd like that.

08:58.900 --> 08:59.800
...talk about all this.

08:59.900 --> 09:01.900
You didn't have to go around and sleep on me.

09:02.000 --> 09:02.900
I love you.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.000
I would never do anything like that to you.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.500
You know i wouldn't.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.400
Wah wah.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.200
You and me.

09:09.300 --> 09:09.900
Not him!

09:10.100 --> 09:10.900
Hey.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.800
I'm always here for you.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.900
I just ask for my guy space.

09:18.000 --> 09:18.600
Hank.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.300
Your guy space?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.200
You know what today is?

09:25.600 --> 09:26.300
Yeah, it's monday.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.300
It's thursday.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.300
Okay, so...

09:34.000 --> 09:35.400
You gave yourself 30 days.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.900
You gave me 30 days.

09:37.000 --> 09:37.800
You agreed to it.

09:38.800 --> 09:39.700
What do you want me to do?

09:39.800 --> 09:41.000
You know what i want you to do.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.500
Nikki, i can't make a new job appear out of thin air.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.600
Yeah, no one can.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.300
That's why we...

09:49.700 --> 09:53.700
That's why we search, apply,interview.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.200
It's a proven technique.

09:55.300 --> 09:57.200
Yeah, i've tried it.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.300
The gardener family managed to pull a few strings

09:59.400 --> 10:02.500
And have me blackballed at every
Level-one trauma center in new york.

10:03.000 --> 10:03.600
Oh.

10:03.900 --> 10:06.100
What about a level-two or a level-three?

10:06.200 --> 10:08.000
Thanks to all these lawsuits and countersuits,

10:08.100 --> 10:09.700
No institution will touch me.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.000
I can't get work as a school nurse.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.700
Just remember one thing...

10:15.900 --> 10:17.900
You put us here, not me.

10:18.500 --> 10:23.500
You're the one who let a billionaire
Hospital trustee die on your day off.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.000
I mean, jesus christ, hank.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.400
This is not what i signed on for.

10:29.400 --> 10:35.400
I wanted to spend on florists and
Caterers and photographers,not attorneys.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.900
I think we need to postpone.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.400
I'll see your postponement and raise you.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.200
I saved the kid.

11:10.700 --> 11:16.600
You've hashed and rehashed every excruciating
Detail of this nightmare over and over again,

11:17.500 --> 11:21.500
But the one thing you never
Mention is that i saved the goddamn kid.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.800
If anyone asks,that's why we called it off.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.700
Since the day i met you, hank,

11:30.900 --> 11:33.600
You have never been able to
Accept the things you can't change.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.400
Right.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.300
That's why we called it off.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.800
I'll send rebecca to get my stuff.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.200
Don't even think i'm splitting
The cancellation costs with you.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.700
Just add the bills to my stack.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.500
* shut up and let me go *

12:03.800 --> 12:05.700
* this hurts, i tell you so *

12:06.100 --> 12:07.000

12:08.500 --> 12:10.200

12:10.400 --> 12:12.200

12:12.300 --> 12:13.400
* i bet you changed *

12:13.500 --> 12:15.000
* your wardrobe since we met *

12:15.100 --> 12:16.800
* now, oh, so easily *

12:16.900 --> 12:17.500
* you're over me *

12:17.600 --> 12:18.900
* gone is love, it's you *

12:19.000 --> 12:20.500
* that ought to be holding me *

12:20.600 --> 12:21.900
* i'm not containable *

12:22.000 --> 12:22.700
* this love now *

12:22.800 --> 12:24.100
* is not sustainable *

12:24.200 --> 12:25.300
* i ain't freaking, *

12:25.400 --> 12:26.400
* i ain't faking this *

12:26.500 --> 12:27.400
* i ain't freaking, *

12:27.500 --> 12:28.600
* i ain't faking this *

12:28.700 --> 12:29.700
* i ain't freaking, *

12:29.800 --> 12:30.800
* i ain't faking this *

12:30.900 --> 12:32.400
* shut up and let me go *

12:32.500 --> 12:32.900
* hey *

12:46.200 --> 12:48.400
Par-tay.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.400
Nikki left.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.100
Yeah.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.000
Yeah, i heard that.

12:54.900 --> 12:55.800
It's, uh--

12:55.900 --> 12:57.900
It's hard to believe she would run away from all this.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.500
Okay,what do you want, evan?

13:00.100 --> 13:01.000
I want to get you out of here.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.100
Yeah, well,i--i can't right now.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.900
Yeah, clearly you're swamped.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.200
You really need to get out of this
Apartment and get some fresh air, bro.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.100
In brooklyn?

13:09.200 --> 13:10.100
Honestly, it smells so bad.

13:10.200 --> 13:15.000
It smells like a moose had sex with a
Bucket of chinese food in here, like musty.

13:15.300 --> 13:18.500
And you kind of look like jesus
And patrick dempsey had a child,

13:18.600 --> 13:21.400
And that child grew older
And then got really sick.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.400
That's weird.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.500
I'm not going anywhere.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.400
Okay, li--look, look,

13:25.500 --> 13:28.100
This trip is gonna get you
Back on your feet, i promise.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.200
Trip?What trip?

13:30.100 --> 13:30.800
Are you kidding?

13:32.400 --> 13:33.500
To the hamptons.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.100
I've been telling you about this all month.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.400
Yeah, and all month,
I've been saying, "no way."

13:38.600 --> 13:40.800
I thought you meant no way like, "no way!"

13:41.100 --> 13:42.700
I haven't meant it that way since i was ten.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.100
How much fun did we have then?

13:44.300 --> 13:44.900
I'm not going.

13:45.300 --> 13:46.500
Okay, hank, listen to me.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.200
Look, it's memorial day weekend, okay?

13:49.300 --> 13:50.700
It's the first weekend of the summer.

13:50.800 --> 13:54.500
The biggest parties in the universe
Are happening out there for the next four days.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.700
I'm not going.

13:55.800 --> 14:01.300
I happen to have an in to
The rager tonight in sagaponack.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.400
Thing's supposed to be epic.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.900
The guy's flying in ice from
Antarctica just for the cocktails.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.200
Obviously. I mean, where else
Are you gonna fly in ice from?

14:13.700 --> 14:19.700
The sushi rolls are gonna be filled with
Southern bluefin tuna and, like, diamond chunks.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.700
Like, people are gonna be eating.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.200
People are gonna be like,
"oh, god. Oh, it's worth it.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.800
Oh, my god,let's have a diamond fight!"

14:25.000 --> 14:25.800
"diamond fight!"

14:25.900 --> 14:29.100
Like, supermodels are gonna be
Mud wrestling over us, hank.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.100
It's gonna be insane.

14:30.200 --> 14:30.800
Okay, you know what?

14:30.900 --> 14:34.100
That really actually does
Sound good,and no, not going.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.000
You know what?You're coming.

14:35.300 --> 14:38.300
I already have us booked in the very
Last hotel suite in the hamptons.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.300
And it's fit for a king.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.700
Evan, i am broke,

14:41.800 --> 14:43.200
Unemployed, depressed,

14:43.400 --> 14:45.400
Disillusioned, and alone.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.900
-are you texting while i'm talking to you?
-hmm?

14:48.000 --> 14:48.700
I can do both.

14:48.900 --> 14:51.000
Why would i want to spend
Tonight partying with a bunch of people

14:51.100 --> 14:52.700
Whose biggest problems revolve around whether or not

14:52.800 --> 14:54.800
To send their yorkshire terriers to therapy, huh?

14:54.900 --> 14:56.500
Give me one decent reason.

14:56.700 --> 14:57.500
I'm gonna give you two.

14:58.300 --> 14:59.500
You're all out of booze.

15:00.815 --> 15:01.541
Two,

15:01.802 --> 15:03.326
Netflix  froze your account.

15:06.647 --> 15:09.567
As your brother,
But also as your accountant,

15:09.567 --> 15:12.580
I'm advising you to donate
This thing to science

15:12.728 --> 15:14.055
And just take the write-off.

15:14.055 --> 15:15.805
Okay, how bad's traffic gonna be?

15:16.492 --> 15:17.630
You mean how good.

15:38.730 --> 15:39.858
This is offensive.

15:39.858 --> 15:41.484
This is the best thing
I've ever seen in my life.

15:41.484 --> 15:42.524
Just relax into it.

15:42.524 --> 15:43.840
Let it take you.

15:48.494 --> 15:49.410
No, no, no!

15:49.410 --> 15:50.520
Look, no, no, no.
Look, look,

15:50.520 --> 15:53.832
I need you to book me v.i.p. Tables
At la playa and dune,

15:54.007 --> 15:55.616
As well as pink elephant, okay?

15:55.616 --> 15:58.531
It's called club-hopping,
Not club-stopping, all right?

15:58.630 --> 16:02.015
And make sure that the real estate
Is current a-list this time.

16:02.254 --> 16:03.196
Make it happen.

16:06.277 --> 16:06.998
Sorry.

16:06.998 --> 16:08.407
Sorry, sorry, i'm sorry.

16:08.407 --> 16:09.540
I just--you know,

16:09.540 --> 16:10.822
Having a lot of money,

16:10.822 --> 16:12.312
Sometimes--i mean,
It's good sometimes,

16:12.312 --> 16:15.442
But sometimes it's aah!
It just drives you so crazy.

16:15.985 --> 16:17.055
You out here all weekend?

16:17.582 --> 16:19.006
Uh, every last drop of it, uh-huh.

16:19.006 --> 16:20.219
North or south?

16:20.219 --> 16:20.944
What's that?

16:21.341 --> 16:22.995
North or south
Of the highway.

16:23.087 --> 16:24.311
Oh, right.
Yeah, of course.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.281
Uh, south.

16:26.708 --> 16:27.745
Do you own or rent?

16:28.710 --> 16:30.144
Renting right now.

16:31.228 --> 16:32.146
Which hampton?

16:32.352 --> 16:33.772
Westhampton.

16:34.147 --> 16:35.921
You mean "worsthampton."

16:37.499 --> 16:38.360
See you.

16:39.868 --> 16:40.919
I'll see you later.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.591
Well, that went well.

16:49.135 --> 16:51.330
- so take a right.
- all right.

16:52.217 --> 16:53.716
Whoa, that is a cool house.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.784
You know what's so fun
When you're driving to the hamptons

17:00.784 --> 17:02.031
And you've been in your house
For three weeks?

17:02.031 --> 17:03.136
- what's that?
- check this out.

17:03.339 --> 17:05.848
- okay, that's not funny.
- just trust me.

17:21.295 --> 17:22.757
Fit for a king, huh?

17:23.222 --> 17:24.422
Uh, i didn't say which country.

17:28.916 --> 17:29.605
How are you?

17:30.505 --> 17:31.973
Dude, they can't even vote.

17:32.155 --> 17:32.869
What?

17:33.170 --> 17:33.852
What?

17:33.852 --> 17:34.970
That's just wrong.

17:47.722 --> 17:49.251
Par-tay.

17:49.474 --> 17:51.060
Tonight is the party.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.209
It's gonna be historic,

17:52.209 --> 17:54.890
And that's why i don't even plan
On sleeping here tonight.

17:54.901 --> 17:57.652
I want to get taken in like
A stray puppy on a rainy night.

17:58.337 --> 18:00.410
Maybe brangelina
Will adopt you.

18:01.733 --> 18:03.190
What's my favorite sport, hank?

18:03.190 --> 18:04.470
Extreme social climbing.

18:05.076 --> 18:05.690
Yeah.

18:06.272 --> 18:06.742
Yeah.

18:38.245 --> 18:38.753
Thanks.

18:38.753 --> 18:39.627
Enjoy your shift.

18:40.180 --> 18:42.241
Whose, uh--
Whose place is this exactly?

18:42.241 --> 18:42.781
Boris.

18:43.003 --> 18:43.886
Boris who?

18:44.079 --> 18:46.434
He's, uh, some german duke
And, like, a trillionaire.

18:46.434 --> 18:47.560
Everyone just calls him boris.

18:48.401 --> 18:49.036
So...

18:49.681 --> 18:50.620
Follow my lead.

18:50.620 --> 18:51.434
What do you mean?

18:51.700 --> 18:53.817
- just act like we're invited.
- well, you said we are invited.

18:53.817 --> 18:55.532
Uh, i said, "i have an in."

18:55.532 --> 18:56.421
Well, how good of an in?

18:57.082 --> 18:59.190
I can't really speak
To that definitively right now.

19:00.272 --> 19:01.518
By the way, my name's wilhelm.

19:01.518 --> 19:02.590
Good evening, gentlemen.

19:02.590 --> 19:03.580
Welcome to shadow pond.

19:03.580 --> 19:04.997
Oh, yes, hello. Shadow pond.

19:17.601 --> 19:18.194
He's new.

19:23.149 --> 19:24.594
I'm sorry,
The name again, please.

19:24.845 --> 19:27.470
Wilhelm friedrich von schmidtstein.

19:28.066 --> 19:29.083
I'm sorry, uh,

19:29.155 --> 19:30.530
I thought it was schmidtsberg.

19:30.530 --> 19:32.157
Yes, well, it was...

19:32.506 --> 19:36.211
Until the prussian hohenzollerns
Took control of berlin in 1891.

19:36.455 --> 19:37.643
1871.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.406
You were there?

19:40.734 --> 19:42.859
Uh, you have
Some identification, please?

19:43.292 --> 19:44.407
But of course.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.981
Identification, yes.

19:47.852 --> 19:48.600
Thank you.

19:51.188 --> 19:52.868
I'm sorry, sir.
Enjoy your evening.

19:54.673 --> 19:58.051
Boris has 312 cousins
Back in deutschland.

19:58.234 --> 19:59.867
He knows maybe four of them,

19:59.867 --> 20:01.406
But he puts them all
On a permanent guest list

20:01.406 --> 20:03.205
Just in case one of them
Pops in during a visit.

20:03.205 --> 20:04.835
Ok, so how
Did you become wilhelm?

20:05.697 --> 20:07.764
I, uh, made a few calls
To the consulate.

20:07.838 --> 20:10.540
I studied the dynasty's
Genealogy on the web.

20:10.841 --> 20:13.766
And then i chose the only name
I had even a shot at rembering.

20:13.926 --> 20:16.494
Right.
And the fake german i.d.?

20:17.643 --> 20:19.117
Puerto rican guy
I know in queens.

20:19.166 --> 20:21.167
Okay, do me a favor.

20:21.774 --> 20:22.410
Yeah.

20:22.397 --> 20:23.829
Never speak to me again.

20:24.002 --> 20:25.507
Uh, hold that thought.

20:35.674 --> 20:36.700
Still mad at me?

20:41.775 --> 20:43.420
Bro, this is where god
Would party.

20:43.420 --> 20:44.733
If he could get in.

20:51.726 --> 20:52.968
You want to hear
Something interesting?

20:53.417 --> 20:54.287
Sure.

20:54.897 --> 20:57.670
For the first time
In a long time,

20:58.060 --> 21:00.547
Uh, you're smiling.

21:54.516 --> 21:56.078
I love that shirt.

21:56.078 --> 21:57.386
I love that shirt.

21:57.386 --> 21:58.811
I love that shirt.

21:58.811 --> 22:00.111
I love this shirt.

22:00.111 --> 22:02.322
Is it from lagerfeld's
New summer collection?

22:02.337 --> 22:04.024
Believe it or not, costco.

22:04.024 --> 22:04.815
Costco.

22:04.815 --> 22:05.573
Costco.

22:05.884 --> 22:07.653
- seriously?
- yeah.

22:10.324 --> 22:13.491
What kind of plane do you have?
And please, tell me it's yours.

22:13.491 --> 22:15.857
I am so over
Fractional ownership.

22:15.857 --> 22:16.671
Right.

22:16.671 --> 22:20.957
I have no money, no job,
And my saab is older than you.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.153
Wait.

22:29.657 --> 22:31.228
So how did you get in here?

22:31.228 --> 22:34.354
My, uh--my friend
Is bavarian royalty.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.816
Honey, this is the hamptons.

22:36.816 --> 22:38.518
Everybody's royalty.

22:38.962 --> 22:40.089
Thanks for the tip.

22:40.178 --> 22:41.347
Hey, come quick.

22:41.347 --> 22:42.485
Something's happened to april.

22:49.634 --> 22:51.029
You all right, april?
You're gonna be all right.

22:52.293 --> 22:52.997
Clear.

22:53.156 --> 22:53.723
Clear.

22:54.491 --> 22:55.430
Dr. Silver here.

22:56.217 --> 22:58.577
When are you damn kids gonna
Learn how to hold your drugs?

22:58.901 --> 23:00.874
Boris' concierge doctor.

23:00.874 --> 23:01.859
Start with some oxy,

23:01.859 --> 23:02.999
Then a little crystal,

23:02.999 --> 23:04.327
Rip a few lines,

23:04.327 --> 23:05.943
And chase it all down
With champagne.

23:06.291 --> 23:07.958
Heaven salad
You kids call it, right?

23:07.929 --> 23:09.866
What?
April doesn't do drugs.

23:10.019 --> 23:10.519
Why?

23:11.093 --> 23:12.123
Because she says she doesn't?

23:12.379 --> 23:13.635
News flash, pretty boy.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.476
Most drug addicts
Are also liars.

23:16.668 --> 23:18.959
Sorry, april, we got to get this
Straight into your system.

23:19.955 --> 23:20.645
Doctor...

23:20.914 --> 23:22.320
You may have misdiagnosed.

23:22.320 --> 23:23.537
Oh, really?
Who are you?

23:23.537 --> 23:25.096
Just a concerned observer.

23:25.921 --> 23:26.990
Well, i observe nausea,

23:27.149 --> 23:28.273
Photosensitivity,

23:28.268 --> 23:29.429
Disorientation,

23:29.418 --> 23:32.682
A few other telltale symptoms
Of an opioid overdose.

23:32.682 --> 23:33.774
What are you observing?

23:33.774 --> 23:34.898
The same symptoms
That you are,

23:34.898 --> 23:36.331
Plus a couple you're not,

23:36.331 --> 23:39.296
Like her miotic pupils
And sludge toxidrome.

23:46.696 --> 23:48.001
It's a chemical nerve agent.

23:48.791 --> 23:49.347
Oh, no.

23:49.736 --> 23:50.674
No, no, no.

23:53.087 --> 23:54.244
Stethoscope, please.

23:59.867 --> 24:00.865
Have you been
With her all night?

24:00.865 --> 24:01.898
- yeah, pretty much.
- okay,

24:01.898 --> 24:03.254
Tell me everywhere
You've been.

24:03.318 --> 24:05.371
Uh, we were
In the walk-in fireplace,

24:05.371 --> 24:07.229
Uh, downstairs
In the recording studio,

24:07.229 --> 24:08.693
- right.
- out in the botanical garden.

24:08.693 --> 24:09.484
The garden...

24:10.395 --> 24:11.333
What did you do there?

24:11.529 --> 24:12.442
Uh, nothing.

24:12.442 --> 24:13.909
She was smelling flowers.

24:15.082 --> 24:16.285
Insecticide.

24:17.199 --> 24:19.632
See, the problem with assuming
The worst about people, dr. Silver,

24:19.632 --> 24:21.986
Is that it lets you
Stop searching for culprits.

24:23.083 --> 24:26.037
Okay, you got any atropine
In the fancy case?

24:46.169 --> 24:46.987
Light, please.

24:47.931 --> 24:48.467
Thank you.

24:53.476 --> 24:55.157
All right, now we need
To get her to a hospital.

24:55.413 --> 24:56.799
You, call 911.

24:56.799 --> 24:58.226
No, thank you.

24:58.377 --> 24:59.058
No.

25:02.348 --> 25:04.255
You can punch
Out for the night, doctor.

25:04.352 --> 25:05.141
Thank you.

25:05.142 --> 25:06.074
No paramedics.

25:06.358 --> 25:07.631
You mean no cops.

25:07.948 --> 25:08.911
Aren't you a doctor?

25:08.891 --> 25:10.653
Yes, but only a doctor.

25:10.710 --> 25:11.919
She needs a hospital.

25:12.050 --> 25:15.037
Hamptons heritage hospital?
The place is a taco stand.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.024
For anything more advanced
Than a band-aid,

25:17.024 --> 25:18.867
We'd have to get her
To stony brook in manhattan.

25:19.294 --> 25:20.045
What does she need?

25:20.045 --> 25:21.464
The second half
Of the antidote.

25:23.551 --> 25:25.207
There must be some way
To help her...

25:25.882 --> 25:27.488
And help me.

25:28.617 --> 25:30.100
I would be doubly grateful.

25:30.933 --> 25:31.711
All right, look out.

25:32.022 --> 25:32.594
Look out.

25:33.048 --> 25:34.121
I got this from here, guy.

25:34.655 --> 25:35.419
Who are you?

25:36.025 --> 25:36.939
I'm a lifeguard.

25:38.099 --> 25:40.547
Are you board certified
In clinical toxicology?

25:41.125 --> 25:42.640
Help me get her up,
Baywatch.

25:45.525 --> 25:46.614
Get her a pillow, please.

25:54.015 --> 25:56.149
- your bodyguards outside.
- what about them?

25:56.179 --> 25:58.139
Nhigh-priced, former mossad.

25:58.455 --> 26:00.253
Okay, do they have mark i kits?

26:00.253 --> 26:02.084
Enough to save everyone
In this house.

26:02.084 --> 26:05.313
Baywatch, go tell them
I need the auto-injector from a mark i kit.

26:05.530 --> 26:06.674
Go. Fast.
Go now.

26:11.777 --> 26:13.104
Where do you practice, doctor?

26:13.104 --> 26:13.730
Nowhere.

26:13.922 --> 26:17.061
My last hospital fired me
For letting a rich patient die.

26:17.758 --> 26:18.668
Bureaucracies.

26:19.366 --> 26:22.980
I find the skilled amongst us
Are better off left to their own devices, yes?

26:25.122 --> 26:25.750
Here.

26:31.927 --> 26:33.199
All right,
Here we go, sweetie.

26:39.930 --> 26:40.736
Hello, april.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.332
She's gonna be fine, right?

26:42.332 --> 26:43.995
She should still be taken
To a hospital,

26:43.995 --> 26:45.834
Whether it serves
Mexican food or not.

26:45.834 --> 26:47.670
You can't just shoot her up
And put her to bed.

26:51.476 --> 26:52.661
My head hurts...

26:53.136 --> 26:54.492
And my throat.

26:54.492 --> 26:56.829
A result of your
Linda blair impersonation.

26:58.498 --> 26:59.052
Thanks.

26:59.064 --> 27:00.205
Here, you should drink
Some water.

27:02.585 --> 27:04.185
Now, look, you've been asleep
Up here for an hour,

27:04.185 --> 27:05.814
But you still need
To take it easy.

27:13.095 --> 27:14.210
You're the one that saved me?

27:14.210 --> 27:16.006
Yeah, the lifeguard
Helped out too.

27:17.044 --> 27:18.020
Who are you?

27:18.020 --> 27:18.905
I'm hank.

27:20.415 --> 27:21.590
Hi, hank.

27:35.497 --> 27:38.789
You always keep a detox kit
Around for the occasional o.d.?

27:39.004 --> 27:41.370
For the protection
Of my guests.

27:41.370 --> 27:43.474
Oh. For the protection
Of your privacy.

27:44.180 --> 27:46.868
So, i-i gather you're boris.

27:46.922 --> 27:49.306
Boris kuester von jurgens-ratenicz.

27:49.975 --> 27:51.953
You'd be informal
About it too, no?

27:51.953 --> 27:53.873
Yeah. I'm hank.

27:53.859 --> 27:55.349
Ah, hank.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.002
Have a seat, hank.

27:58.451 --> 27:59.072
Uh, you know what?

27:59.072 --> 28:00.181
It's a pleasure meeting you,

28:00.181 --> 28:01.359
-  but--
- i wanted to thank you.

28:01.983 --> 28:02.794
Yeah, no sweat.

28:03.762 --> 28:05.515
And compensate you
For the trouble.

28:05.515 --> 28:07.236
Oh, yeah, look,
I can't accept that.

28:09.570 --> 28:11.276
A pro bonoconcierge doctor.

28:11.348 --> 28:12.694
Concierge doctor?

28:12.973 --> 28:14.766
Private physician for hire.

28:15.211 --> 28:19.190
All the rage
Amongst us elite folk.

28:19.190 --> 28:21.484
No, i was just in the wrong
Place at the right time,

28:21.615 --> 28:24.620
And i was ethically obligated
To intervene.

28:25.294 --> 28:27.015
But you should've called
The girl an ambulance.

28:27.552 --> 28:28.917
Life isn't always simple.

28:29.264 --> 28:30.358
Well, death is.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.365
Sit down, hank.

28:34.509 --> 28:35.292
Please.

28:41.984 --> 28:42.917
You're quite right.

28:43.086 --> 28:45.945
My privacy is sacred to me.

28:46.553 --> 28:50.001
And i can't afford
Any unwanted attention this summer.

28:52.419 --> 28:55.981
Last thing i need is a page six
Sensation on the first weekend.

28:56.671 --> 28:59.222
But something told me truly
She was in better hands...

28:59.961 --> 29:00.897
With you.

29:03.498 --> 29:04.336
Where are you staying?

29:05.096 --> 29:07.257
Some theme park
In "worsthampton."

29:07.352 --> 29:08.933
Stay in my guest cottage.

29:09.331 --> 29:10.220
For the summer.

29:11.497 --> 29:13.105
It'll be vacant shortly.

29:13.073 --> 29:14.804
Yea--no, i'm only out here
For the weekend.

29:17.124 --> 29:18.593
Well, if you extend
Your stay...

29:26.991 --> 29:28.237
Bye, hank!

29:31.435 --> 29:33.664
And then i could
Tie it up in a package for you.

29:35.925 --> 29:37.499
Hey! Oh, my god!
Where have you been?!

29:37.562 --> 29:38.343

Of having a roman orgy

29:46.051 --> 29:47.322
With the entire cast
Of gossip girl.

29:47.322 --> 29:49.638

Back at the motel after prom.

For the first time In my life,
I may actually be In love with a guy,

And you want me To just relay
that info to him Through his half-Nude,

37:00.200 --> 37:03.500
Number-Crunching Little brother?

37:04.100 --> 37:05.700
It's just a bit awkward,
Don't you think?

37:05.800 --> 37:09.000

it would be 100% socially unacceptable.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.000
You know hank saved my life?

Of hand-Assembled machinery.

on not hurting Your old man, right?

A few ounces of frozen yogurt--

43:02.600 --> 43:04.300
Overhyped frozen yogurt,
I might add.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.700
It's not overhyped, dude.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.600
It's a tart, refreshing,
Fat-Free snack

That offers 10% rda of calcium
Per serving.

43:10.800 --> 43:12.600

What's happening to him?
Beck's? What do you mean beck's?

And bled Into the pericardial sac.

44:13.300 --> 44:14.500
What are you talking about?

44:14.500 --> 44:17.600
His heart is being squeezed
And not circulating blood To his brain.

He needs the fluid drained,
But because of his hemophilia,

48:06.500 --> 48:07.700
We need to see More of each other.

48:07.700 --> 48:09.100
I don't think That's such a good idea.

48:09.200 --> 48:09.900
Why not?

48:10.000 --> 48:11.600
Your judgment Is still clouded.

48:11.700 --> 48:13.400
It has never been Clearer, hank.

48:13.600 --> 48:16.300
Listen, these feelings
You think you have--

48:16.300 --> 48:17.900
Who here knows More about my feelings?

48:17.900 --> 48:18.900
I do.

48:19.100 --> 48:20.200
Oh, really?

48:20.400 --> 48:21.400
How's that?

48:21.600 --> 48:24.000
Because this isn't An emotional issue.
It's a medical one.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.700
It's called Nightingale syndrome.

48:26.500 --> 48:27.200
What's that?

48:27.300 --> 48:29.300
It's where a patient In critical care

48:29.300 --> 48:32.200
Develops an emotional dependency
On his or her caretaker.

48:33.700 --> 48:35.100
I don't have Nightingale syndrome.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.000
Prove it.

48:36.300 --> 48:36.900
How?

48:37.000 --> 48:38.300
Don't see me for a month.

48:38.600 --> 48:40.200
If you still Have your feelings then,

48:40.900 --> 48:42.000
We'll talk.

48:42.600 --> 48:43.400
Are you here all summer?

48:43.400 --> 48:45.100
No, just for the weekend.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.400
Well, you're not making this
Very easy on me.

48:47.400 --> 48:48.400
Sorry.

48:48.500 --> 48:49.600
Next!

48:51.900 --> 48:53.000
The doctor will see you now.

48:54.700 --> 48:55.600
Divya.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.200
Divya, divya, hold on.

48:58.800 --> 48:59.500
What's wrong?

48:59.500 --> 49:00.800
Well, i think We skipped a part.

49:00.800 --> 49:02.000
Oh. Which part?

49:02.100 --> 49:04.200
The part where you tell me
What the hell is going on here.

49:04.700 --> 49:06.300
I'd like to be your p.A.

49:06.300 --> 49:07.000
My p.A.

49:07.100 --> 49:08.200
Physician assistant.

49:08.200 --> 49:09.200
Why would i need one?

49:10.000 --> 49:11.800
All concierge doctors Have a p.A.

49:11.800 --> 49:13.600
I am not a concierge doctor.

49:13.600 --> 49:14.500
What's a concierge doctor?

49:14.600 --> 49:15.900
It's the doctor Of the future.

49:15.900 --> 49:17.600
It's the newest accessory Of the rich.

49:17.600 --> 49:19.500
It's how we all did it once.

49:19.600 --> 49:20.900
You know, the folksy neighbor

49:20.900 --> 49:23.300
Walking up to your door
With a little black bag.

49:23.300 --> 49:25.300
Right, but now
It's a former department chair

49:25.300 --> 49:29.100
For mayo or mass general Or ucla
Rolling up in an suv

49:29.100 --> 49:32.100
With portable x-Ray,
Ultrasound, and ekg gear.

49:32.100 --> 49:34.000
It's--It's doctors on demand.

49:34.100 --> 49:35.200
What's so wrong with that?

49:35.300 --> 49:38.200
Nothing, nothing. It's just--
It's not what i do.

49:38.300 --> 49:39.300
Well, what about april?

49:39.400 --> 49:40.300
I was a bystander.

49:40.300 --> 49:41.900
What about tucker bryant?

49:43.000 --> 49:43.800
How could You possibly know--

49:43.800 --> 49:45.800
I got a call
While you were talking to april.

49:46.700 --> 49:49.500
- It's the hamptons.
- Yeah, word travels fast, I know.

49:49.500 --> 49:53.100
Look, two freak occurrences.
I have not set up shop In the hamptons.

49:53.100 --> 49:56.200
I know, and i guess
What i'm saying is, "why not?"

49:56.300 --> 49:57.100
Wait a minute.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.100
So you've been here For 24 hours,

50:02.200 --> 50:05.000
And you already have a bar
Of gold in your nightstand.

50:05.000 --> 50:05.600
It's chocolate.

50:05.600 --> 50:07.200
- The maid puts it on the pillow.
- No, no, no, it's gold.

50:07.200 --> 50:09.900
And you're chasing away
Supermodels. Like,

50:10.300 --> 50:12.200
imagine what we could do
If we actually tried.

50:12.200 --> 50:13.100
We? Who's we?

50:13.200 --> 50:16.700
Hank, you're Up to your eyes in debt.
With no income To service that debt,

50:16.800 --> 50:18.100
And your bills Back in brooklyn--

50:18.100 --> 50:20.400
They're stacking up
Like buckwheat pancakes.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.200
You got a better career plan?

50:22.400 --> 50:26.200
I took the liberty of doing
Some back-Of-The-Envelope ???

50:26.300 --> 50:30.000
A rough estimate of the emergency-Medicine
market Out here during the season

50:30.000 --> 50:32.600
And a practice model
Of services and fees.

50:32.700 --> 50:34.300
With virtually No capital outlay,

50:34.400 --> 50:35.400
Conservative pricing,

50:35.500 --> 50:38.300
And relying strictly
On word-Of-Mouth and referrals,

50:38.700 --> 50:40.700
You could bank Some nice coin here.

50:40.900 --> 50:42.400
Dude, I really like this girl.

50:50.900 --> 50:52.100
Aren't you going to get it?

50:54.900 --> 50:56.200
- Would you--That's my--
- Doctor's office.

50:56.200 --> 50:57.100
How can i help you?

50:57.300 --> 50:58.200
Excuse me, you're not my--

50:58.200 --> 51:01.000

51:01.100 --> 51:02.300

Okay, okay. No, okay, okay.

51:12.300 --> 51:15.000
Ms. Newberg, i don't even know
What happened to you, but i--

51:15.600 --> 51:17.000

51:33.100 --> 51:35.100
And a few other things
That may come in handy.

51:35.600 --> 51:36.500
Shotgun.

51:42.500 --> 51:43.900
You really came prepared.

51:43.900 --> 51:45.200
Core wound care,

51:45.300 --> 51:46.600
Home diagnostics...

51:48.300 --> 51:49.600
Infusion i.V.

51:49.700 --> 51:51.700
Why does a p.A. Drive around
With them in her trunk?

51:51.800 --> 51:52.800
Well, they were on sale.

51:53.000 --> 51:53.800
Divya.

51:54.200 --> 51:57.100
Look, i want to show you
All i can bring to the table

51:57.300 --> 52:00.400
Besides my work ethic,
My knowledge of the hamptons,

52:00.400 --> 52:02.000
My relationships With the locals--

52:02.000 --> 52:03.400
Your superbly Well-Toned figure.

52:03.400 --> 52:05.100
Don't objectify me, Sidekick.

52:15.700 --> 52:17.300
This is it.

52:17.700 --> 52:18.600
This is what?

52:18.700 --> 52:20.500
The address That woman gave hank.

52:20.600 --> 52:22.300
No, no, no, There has to be a mistake.

52:22.400 --> 52:24.500
No, no, this is it.

52:24.700 --> 52:26.600
This is where mrs. Newberg Is stranded,

52:26.900 --> 52:28.800
In desperate need Of medical assistance.

52:28.800 --> 52:30.600
I guess we can leave The toys in the car.

52:30.800 --> 52:32.000
Evan, that includes you.

52:32.700 --> 52:34.300
A little faster, doctor.

52:34.400 --> 52:35.600
I'm coming.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.100
You think one of these people
Is ms. Newberg?

52:49.200 --> 52:52.600
I have been waiting here
More than 45 minutes!

52:52.800 --> 52:53.400
Never mind.

52:53.400 --> 52:56.600
No, i will not fill out
Any more forms.

52:58.300 --> 52:59.900
General admissions Are this way.

53:00.200 --> 53:01.800
And there she is, In the fur coat.

53:01.900 --> 53:05.800
This is ridiculous!
I demand to see The administrator!

53:05.800 --> 53:09.300
Will you please Stop screaming,
ms. Newberg?

53:09.400 --> 53:11.100
Oh, joy. Can't wait to meet her.

53:11.100 --> 53:13.200
Oh,that ms. Newberg.

53:13.200 --> 53:14.400
You--You know her?

53:14.600 --> 53:15.500
Of her.

53:15.600 --> 53:17.000
They call her "New parts" newberg.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.900
Are you even listening To me?!

53:22.000 --> 53:23.300
ms. Newberg?

53:23.300 --> 53:24.400
Are you the administrator?

53:24.400 --> 53:25.300
No, i'm hank.

53:25.400 --> 53:28.500
Oh, good. I hear wonderful things.

53:28.500 --> 53:29.800
Great. This is divya.

53:29.800 --> 53:30.900
I'm his physician assistant.

53:30.900 --> 53:32.500
She's not My physician assistant.

53:33.100 --> 53:34.400
I need your help, hank.

53:34.400 --> 53:36.500
Ms. Newberg, You're in a hospital.

53:36.600 --> 53:38.700
- No, this is not a hospital.
- It's not?

53:38.800 --> 53:41.100
It's a socialist conspiracy.

53:41.200 --> 53:45.000
Apparently, If you're not holding
your Dismembered leg in your hand,

53:45.000 --> 53:46.800
You don't require treatment.

53:46.900 --> 53:49.600
There's a line,
Based on medical necessity.

53:49.700 --> 53:51.000
And you belong At the back of it.

53:51.200 --> 53:52.900
Lines are for the "citiots."

53:53.000 --> 53:53.600
What's a citiot?

53:53.600 --> 53:55.700
It's what we call you people
Who come out Just for the weekend.

53:55.700 --> 53:58.300
Thank you. Ms. Newberg,
What's your emergency?

54:10.600 --> 54:12.100
I've got a flat tire.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.700
Okay, i'm not aaa.

54:14.900 --> 54:16.100
No.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.400
A flat tire.

54:20.200 --> 54:21.000
Oh...

54:21.000 --> 54:22.400
Dear.

54:22.500 --> 54:25.700
I spent the entire off-Season
On this project.

54:25.800 --> 54:29.300
I waited months
To debut these two saline gems

54:29.300 --> 54:30.800
On the beach this weekend,

54:30.900 --> 54:33.300
And i wake up this morning And pbht!

54:34.100 --> 54:34.800
Flat tire.

54:34.900 --> 54:36.600
That's a shame.
But it's not my area.

54:36.800 --> 54:38.200
In fact, I shouldn't
have even come here.

54:38.300 --> 54:40.400
Look, the good news is,
You'll be fine.

54:40.500 --> 54:42.800
The saline is harmless.
Your body will simply absorb it.

54:42.800 --> 54:44.000
Just wait your turn,

54:44.000 --> 54:46.700
And the e.R. Staff here
Will take good care Of you, i'm sure.

54:46.700 --> 54:47.600
Hank, let's help her.

54:47.600 --> 54:48.700
- No.
- You must.

54:48.700 --> 54:50.500
- I'm sorry.
- Please.

54:50.600 --> 54:53.800
I can't go around
Looking like this In the hamptons,

54:53.900 --> 54:56.500
Like some high-Society Circus freak.

54:56.600 --> 54:57.900
What am i supposed to do With this?

54:58.000 --> 54:59.300
Hang beach towels On this thing?

54:59.300 --> 55:00.800
I mean, they're supposed
To come in pairs.

55:00.900 --> 55:02.800
I have no privileges
At this hospital.

55:02.800 --> 55:05.100
In fact, me even standing here
Consulting with you

55:05.100 --> 55:07.700
Is probably 12
different kinds of illegal.

55:08.100 --> 55:09.900
And i have no equipment
Or facilities of my own.

55:09.900 --> 55:11.500
Oh, i can get us Everything we need.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.300
Well, your assistant
Seems very confident--

55:13.300 --> 55:14.100
She's not my assistant.

55:14.200 --> 55:15.700
Offer to pay him generously.

55:16.000 --> 55:16.700
Divya.

55:16.800 --> 55:17.700
He needs the money.

55:17.800 --> 55:19.900
- I'll pay any amount.
- That's not the point.

55:19.900 --> 55:21.600
I'll pay enough money
To make it the point.

55:21.600 --> 55:23.200
- Ms. Newberg--
- I don't take no For an answer.

55:23.200 --> 55:25.800
Take it or leave it,
It's my answer.

55:26.300 --> 55:27.300
Have a great day.

55:27.600 --> 55:28.900
Can i be of any help here?

55:30.100 --> 55:31.500
You already had your chance.

55:31.600 --> 55:33.400
Nice to see you again, Ms. Newberg.

55:33.500 --> 55:35.500
This is hank, My private physician.

55:35.700 --> 55:37.400
I'm not Her private physician.

55:37.500 --> 55:38.400
We kind of met--

55:38.600 --> 55:40.700
Jill casey,
Hospital administrator.

55:40.800 --> 55:42.700
Hank lawson, Uh, between jobs.

55:42.800 --> 55:44.400
Nice to meet you, Dr. Lawson.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
Can we confer a moment
One-On-One, please?

55:48.000 --> 55:49.300
Yeah, sure.

55:50.800 --> 55:52.700
He's very selective
About his clientele,

55:53.100 --> 55:54.500
But i think he likes you.

55:54.600 --> 55:57.000
So you're the new
Concierge doctor in town?

55:57.100 --> 55:58.300
No, no, no. No, i'm not.

55:58.300 --> 55:59.500
I-I ca--I can explain that.

55:59.500 --> 56:02.000
No, don't. In fact,
I just want to thank you

56:02.000 --> 56:04.300
For taking that
frequent flier Off our hands.

56:04.400 --> 56:05.000

56:05.100 --> 56:07.300

Every time one of her, uh,

56:07.400 --> 56:08.500
Renovations goes awry,

56:08.500 --> 56:10.600
And she expects to leapfrog
Over dozens of people

56:10.600 --> 56:13.500
With staph infections
And skull fractures, Chest pains...

56:14.200 --> 56:17.900
Well, you know what comes
Into an e.R., i'm sure.

56:18.100 --> 56:19.800

So you gonna fix Her flat tire?

56:28.600 --> 56:30.400
Uh, when i said consultation,

56:30.400 --> 56:32.300
I was thinking someplace
A little more private.

56:32.300 --> 56:33.100
Well, you don't mind, do you?

56:33.100 --> 56:35.000
I've just got a couple things
I gotta pick up in town.

56:35.200 --> 56:36.800
Besides, i'm not shy.

56:36.900 --> 56:37.900
right.

56:38.300 --> 56:39.900
So come on, Let's
cut to the chase, hank.

56:39.900 --> 56:42.600
Okay, okay, Um, saline, not silicone.

56:42.600 --> 56:43.900
- Right.
- Single-Lumen?

56:44.000 --> 56:44.600
Yes.

56:44.600 --> 56:45.500
Volume?

56:46.700 --> 56:48.000
900 ccs.

56:48.300 --> 56:50.400
850 is the maximum You can buy

56:50.500 --> 56:52.200
Without going To the custom market.

56:52.300 --> 56:54.200
I don't do anything Half-Ass, dear.

Get custom parts?

57:19.400 --> 57:20.400

Symmetry Is the key to beauty.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.100

I haven't actually Decided

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.400
Can i ask you something?

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.600
As medical professionals,

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:34.600
Do you think we are
Who we care for?

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.700
You know, we're not all
Movie stars and moguls out here.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.500
We do have some ordinary folk.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.300
Like, uh, busboys, and plumbers,
Electricians...

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.800
Yeah, i saw--The contractor
With the lower back injury

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.600
- Yeah.
- And the older woman

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.900
With asthmatic bronchitis.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:50.800
Well, they're the people
That keep this place running.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.300
If it weren't for them, the vips
Wouldn't be able to tell The difference

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.100
between Easthampton and east newark.

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.000
Hey, easy on jersey.

01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.700
Oh, uh, that was me
Being easy on jersey.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.100
Oh!

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.300
Anyway...

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.200
They're mainly the people
That come into my e.R.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.300
'Cause, well,
They get sick and injured too.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:10.100
Right.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.100
But none of that matters.

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:12.400
The only thing that matters
At the end of the day

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.300
is that These people need help,
and if I don't help them, who will?

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:16.200
Exactly.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.900
Not your old boss In brooklyn.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.400
My grad school has
A tight-Knit alumni network,

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.100
And i asked around.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.200
I guess you can't Escape your past.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.200
Yours won't follow you For too long.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.300
What do you mean?

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.100
Well, the kid was obviously
The sicker patient,

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:39.200
And to have a cardiac tamponade
During an angio

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.100
Is kind of like having Your gas tank
explode When you're filling her up.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.100
You triaged by the book.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.800
It was bad luck, Not a bad call.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:49.900
How could you possibly kn--

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.100
Thank you.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.900
And if i were the hospital
Administrator there,

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.600
I would've had your back All the way.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.200
Yeah, and you Would've been fired too.

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:00.400
Gladly.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.200
Because i think what happened
To you is unacceptable, hank.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.000
And we need to change the things
That we can't accept.

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:09.200
Yeah.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.400
Yeah, that sounds about right.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.400

But it might take a while.
