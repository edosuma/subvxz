00:25.180 --> 00:27.420
Mummy?

00:39.500 --> 00:42.579
Mummy! Wake up! Wake up!

00:42.580 --> 00:44.580
Mummy!

01:02.140 --> 01:03.819
Wake up!

01:23.980 --> 01:28.419
Help me, please! I'm on a plane
and everyone's asleep! Help me!

01:28.420 --> 01:31.184
'Hello. My name's Jim Moriarty.

01:32.464 --> 01:35.333
'Welcome to the final problem.'

02:08.660 --> 02:10.899
- 'You know, I could arrest you.
- What for?

02:10.900 --> 02:13.859
- 'Wearing a dress like that.
- Would you like me to take it off?

02:13.860 --> 02:16.739
- 'Then I'd really have to press charges.
- Press away.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.379
'Isn't that how they got started?

02:19.380 --> 02:20.393
- 'Who?
- Adam and Eve.

02:20.418 --> 02:22.259
- Oh, them.
- And that turned out OK.

02:22.260 --> 02:23.939
'You think so?

02:23.940 --> 02:26.859
'I thought it was supposed to be
the beginning of all human misery.

02:26.860 --> 02:29.499
'Now, what was all
that about arresting me?

02:29.500 --> 02:31.579
- 'Well, maybe not arresting you.
- No?

02:31.580 --> 02:33.779
'I could just keep
you under close watch.

02:33.780 --> 02:36.060
- 'Very close?
- A-huh.

02:38.891 --> 02:42.635
'Shame, I was looking forward to putting
myself into the hands of the authorities.

02:42.669 --> 02:43.699
'You were?

02:43.700 --> 02:48.820
'Finger-printing, being
searched... thoroughly.'

03:04.020 --> 03:07.355
_

03:19.780 --> 03:22.019
Mycroft?

03:39.300 --> 03:40.820
DOOR SLAMS SHUT

04:09.820 --> 04:11.460
Mycroft?

04:15.420 --> 04:17.219
Why don't you come
out and show yourself?

04:17.220 --> 04:18.887
I don't have time for this.

04:18.913 --> 04:21.329
We have time, Mycroft.

04:21.355 --> 04:23.299
All the time in the world.

04:32.140 --> 04:33.740
Mycroft?

04:36.636 --> 04:38.155
Who are you?

04:38.180 --> 04:39.700
You know.

04:41.940 --> 04:43.499
Impossible.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.179
Nothing's impossible.

04:46.180 --> 04:48.580
You of all people know that.

04:53.603 --> 04:56.087
It's coming to get you.

04:58.700 --> 05:03.579
There's an east wind coming,
Mycroft. Coming to get you.

05:03.580 --> 05:05.620
You can't have got out! You can't!

05:31.567 --> 05:37.115
No use, Mycroft. There's no
defence and nowhere to hide.

05:37.140 --> 05:39.380
Y-a-a-a-argh!

05:56.713 --> 05:59.419
Sherlock? Help me!

06:04.018 --> 06:08.179
Experiment complete.
Conclusion, I have a sister.

06:08.180 --> 06:11.459
This was you? All of this was you?!

06:11.460 --> 06:14.259
Conclusion two, my
sister, Eurus, apparently,

06:14.260 --> 06:16.859
has been incarcerated from an
early age in a secure institution

06:16.860 --> 06:19.659
controlled by my brother. Hey, Bro!

06:19.660 --> 06:22.859
Why would you do this,
this pantomime? Why?!

06:22.860 --> 06:26.099
Conclusion three, you
are terrified of her.

06:26.100 --> 06:29.219
You have no idea what you're
dealing with. None at all!

06:29.220 --> 06:31.259
New information, she's out.

06:31.260 --> 06:32.819
That's not possible.

06:32.820 --> 06:34.819
It's more than possible,
she was John's therapist.

06:34.820 --> 06:37.659
- Shot me during a session.
- Only with a tranquilliser.

06:37.660 --> 06:40.539
- Hm. We still had ten minutes to go.
- Well, we'll see about a refund.

06:40.540 --> 06:42.859
Right, you two, Wiggins has
got your money by the gate,

06:42.860 --> 06:44.339
don't spend it all in one crack den.

06:45.660 --> 06:48.259
Oh, I hope we didn't spoil
your enjoyment of the movie.

06:48.260 --> 06:49.299
You're just leaving?!

06:49.300 --> 06:51.819
Well, we're not staying here,
Eurus is coming and, er...

06:51.820 --> 06:54.059
someone's disabled all your security.

06:54.060 --> 06:55.460
Sleep well!

06:56.594 --> 07:00.099
Dr Watson, why would he do
that to me? That was insane!

07:00.100 --> 07:03.139
Er... yes, well, someone convinced
him that you wouldn't tell the truth

07:03.140 --> 07:05.259
unless you were actually
wetting yourself.

07:05.260 --> 07:06.899
Someone?

07:06.900 --> 07:08.179
Probably me.

07:08.180 --> 07:10.379
So, that's it, is it? You're just going?

07:10.380 --> 07:13.619
Well, don't worry, there's
a place for people like you,

07:13.620 --> 07:15.619
the desperate, the terrified.

07:15.620 --> 07:17.779
The ones with nowhere else to run.

07:17.780 --> 07:20.219
What place?

07:20.220 --> 07:21.948
221B Baker Street.

07:23.100 --> 07:26.699
See you in the morning. If
there's a queue, join it.

07:26.700 --> 07:30.059
For God's sake, this is
not one of your idiot cases!

07:30.060 --> 07:32.779
You might want to close that window.

07:32.780 --> 07:34.420
There is an east wind coming.

07:51.369 --> 07:52.979
You have to sit in the chair.

07:52.980 --> 07:56.219
They won't talk to you unless you
sit in the chair, it's the rules.

07:56.220 --> 07:58.420
- I'm not a client!
- Then get out.

08:07.997 --> 08:10.117
She's not going to stay there, is she?

08:13.313 --> 08:15.459
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- Thank you.

08:15.460 --> 08:16.900
The kettle's over there.

08:19.399 --> 08:22.499
So, what happens now? Are
you going to make deductions?

08:22.500 --> 08:25.259
You're going to tell the
truth, Mycroft. Pure and simple.

08:25.260 --> 08:30.179
Who was it said, "The truth is
rarely pure and never simple"?

08:30.180 --> 08:31.979
I don't know and I don't care.

08:31.980 --> 08:34.698
So, there were three
of us, I know that now.

08:34.700 --> 08:39.220
You, me and Eurus.

08:40.940 --> 08:43.438
A sister I can't remember.

08:44.780 --> 08:47.979
Interesting name, Eurus.
It's Greek, isn't it?

08:47.980 --> 08:51.659
Hm. Yeah, literally,
the God of the East Wind.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.179
Yes.

08:53.180 --> 08:55.819
"The east wind is coming, Sherlock."

08:55.820 --> 08:57.939
You used that to scare me.

08:57.940 --> 08:59.966
- No.
- You turned my sister

08:59.991 --> 09:01.739
into a ghost story.

09:01.740 --> 09:04.499
Of course I didn't. I monitored you.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.980
You what?

09:07.064 --> 09:09.139
Memories can resurface.

09:09.140 --> 09:11.139
Wounds can reopen.

09:11.140 --> 09:14.396
The roads we walk have demons beneath.

09:15.849 --> 09:18.900
And yours have been waiting
for a very long time.

09:20.180 --> 09:23.019
I never bullied you. I
used, at discreet intervals,

09:23.020 --> 09:24.419
potential trigger words

09:24.420 --> 09:27.019
to update myself as to
your mental condition.

09:27.020 --> 09:28.299
I was looking after you.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.041
Why can't I remember her?

09:31.980 --> 09:34.499
- This is a private matter.
- John stays.

09:34.500 --> 09:38.167
- This is family!
- That's why he stays!

09:44.058 --> 09:49.139
So there were three Holmes kids.
What was the age gap?

09:49.140 --> 09:51.019
Seven years between myself and Sherlock,

09:51.020 --> 09:53.179
one year between Sherlock and Eurus.

09:53.180 --> 09:54.900
Middle child. Explains a lot.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.459
- So, did she have it, too?
- Have what?

09:59.460 --> 10:01.059
The deduction thing.

10:01.060 --> 10:02.780
The deduction thing?

10:04.100 --> 10:06.620
Yes. More than you can know.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.299
Enlighten me.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.739
- You realise I'm the smart one?
- As you never cease to announce.

10:12.740 --> 10:16.939
But Eurus, she was
incandescent, even then.

10:16.940 --> 10:19.979
Our abilities were professionally
assessed more than once.

10:19.980 --> 10:21.939
I was remarkable,

10:21.940 --> 10:26.659
but Eurus was described
as an era-defining genius.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.619
Beyond Newton.

10:28.620 --> 10:30.859
Then why don't I remember her?

10:30.860 --> 10:33.459
You do remember her, in a way.

10:33.460 --> 10:36.339
Every choice you ever made,
every path you've ever taken,

10:36.340 --> 10:38.351
the man you are today...

10:39.500 --> 10:41.961
...is your memory of Eurus.

10:45.740 --> 10:48.979
She was different from the beginning.

10:48.980 --> 10:51.700
She knew things she
should never have known.

10:54.146 --> 10:57.498
As if she was somehow aware of
truths beyond the normal scope.

11:01.131 --> 11:02.740
You look funny grown-up.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.460
- What's wrong?
- Sorry.

11:08.220 --> 11:09.819
The memories are disturbing.

11:09.820 --> 11:12.339
What do you mean? Examples.

11:12.340 --> 11:16.139
They found her with a knife once.
She seemed to be cutting herself.

11:16.140 --> 11:17.739
Mother and Father were terrified.

11:17.740 --> 11:19.859
They thought it was a suicide attempt.

11:19.860 --> 11:23.939
But when I asked Eurus what
she was doing, she said:

11:23.940 --> 11:27.299
I wanted to see how my muscles worked.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.273
- Jesus!
- So I asked her if

11:29.298 --> 11:31.739
she felt pain, and she said:

11:31.740 --> 11:33.699
Which one's pain?

11:33.700 --> 11:35.500
Then what happened?

11:38.940 --> 11:40.580
Musgrave.

11:43.100 --> 11:47.459
The ancestral home, where
there was always honey for tea.

11:47.460 --> 11:48.874
And Sherlock played among the

11:48.899 --> 11:51.779
- funny gravestones.
- Funny how?

11:51.780 --> 11:53.499
Come on, you lot!

11:53.500 --> 11:56.379
They weren't real. The
dates were all wrong.

11:56.380 --> 11:59.569
An architectural joke
which fascinated Sherlock.

12:01.900 --> 12:06.579
♪ Deep down below the
old beech tree... ♪

12:06.580 --> 12:09.779
- Help succour me now the...
- East winds blow.

12:09.780 --> 12:12.819
- ♪ East winds blow...
- 16 by six.

12:12.820 --> 12:14.379
♪ 16 by six... ♪

12:14.380 --> 12:16.899

12:16.900 --> 12:19.740
You're starting to remember. Fragments.

12:22.060 --> 12:24.820
Redbeard? Redbeard?

12:26.941 --> 12:29.139
- Redbeard?
- He was my dog.

12:29.140 --> 12:33.179
Eurus took Redbeard and locked him
up somewhere no-one could find him.

12:33.180 --> 12:35.820
- Redbeard?
- And she refused to say where he was.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.875
Redbeard?

12:39.220 --> 12:41.339
She'd only repeat that song.

12:41.340 --> 12:43.979
Her little ritual.

12:43.980 --> 12:48.059
We begged and begged
her to tell us where he was.

12:48.060 --> 12:51.859
The song is the answer.

12:51.860 --> 12:54.059
But the song made no sense.

12:54.060 --> 12:58.299
♪ ...Brother, and under we go. ♪

12:58.300 --> 13:01.539
- What happened to Redbeard?
- We never found him.

13:01.540 --> 13:05.219
But she started calling
him Drowned Redbeard,

13:05.220 --> 13:06.900
so we made our assumptions.

13:09.420 --> 13:11.419
Sherlock was traumatised.

13:11.420 --> 13:15.539
Natural, I suppose. He was, in
the early days, an emotional child.

13:15.540 --> 13:18.739
But after that, he was
different. So changed.

13:18.740 --> 13:20.699
Never spoke of it again.

13:20.700 --> 13:24.560
In time, he seemed to forget
that Eurus had ever even existed.

13:25.154 --> 13:27.453
How could he forget? She was
living in the same house.

13:27.478 --> 13:28.478
No.

13:29.717 --> 13:32.460
- They took her away.
- Why?

13:34.700 --> 13:36.979
You don't lock up a child
because a dog goes missing.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.420
Quite so.

13:39.227 --> 13:42.915
It was what happened
immediately afterwards.

13:44.918 --> 13:47.205
She knows where he is.

13:47.230 --> 13:49.229
We can't make her tell us.

13:49.254 --> 13:51.630
We can't make her do anything!

14:14.448 --> 14:16.188
After that, our sister had

14:16.213 --> 14:18.419
- to be taken away.
- Where?

14:18.420 --> 14:22.019
Oh, some suitable place,
or so everyone thought.

14:22.020 --> 14:24.219
Not suitable enough, however.

14:24.220 --> 14:25.899
- She died there.
- How?

14:25.900 --> 14:29.619
She started another fire.
One which she did not survive.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.859
This is a lie.

14:31.860 --> 14:33.380
Yes.

14:34.460 --> 14:36.379
It is also a kindness.

14:36.380 --> 14:39.379
This is the story I told our
parents to spare them further pain,

14:39.380 --> 14:42.059
and to account for the absence
of an identifiable body.

14:42.060 --> 14:44.099
And no doubt to prevent
their further interference.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.859
Well, that, too, of course.

14:45.860 --> 14:49.579
The depth of Eurus's psychosis
and the extent of her abilities

14:49.580 --> 14:53.019
couldn't hope to be contained
in any ordinary institution.

14:53.020 --> 14:55.499
Uncle Rudi took care of things.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.019
Where is she, Mycroft?
Where's our sister?

14:58.020 --> 15:01.179
There's a place called Sherrinford.

15:01.180 --> 15:03.739
An island.

15:03.740 --> 15:06.619
It's a secure and very
secret installation

15:06.620 --> 15:11.259
whose sole purpose is to contain
what we call the uncontainables.

15:11.260 --> 15:16.019
The demons beneath the road?
This is where we trap them.

15:16.020 --> 15:18.859
Sherrinford is more than
a prison, or an asylum.

15:18.860 --> 15:20.259
It is a fortress,

15:20.260 --> 15:24.219
built to keep the rest of the
world safe from what is inside it.

15:24.220 --> 15:28.360
Heaven may be a fantasy for
the credulous and the afraid.

15:30.037 --> 15:32.485
But I can give you a
map reference for hell.

15:35.220 --> 15:37.819
That's where our sister has
been since early childhood.

15:37.820 --> 15:39.939
She hasn't left, not for a single day.

15:39.940 --> 15:43.099

it can't have been her.

I've authorised the purchase
of quite a number of these.

16:23.740 --> 16:26.700
Colloquially, it is known
as the patience grenade.

16:29.460 --> 16:31.179
Patience?

16:31.180 --> 16:32.939
The motion sensor has activated.

16:32.940 --> 16:34.620
If any of us move, the grenade

16:34.645 --> 16:36.299
- will detonate.
- How powerful?

16:36.300 --> 16:38.859
It'll certainly destroy this
flat and kill anyone in it.

16:38.860 --> 16:40.459
Assuming walls of reasonable strength,

16:40.460 --> 16:42.939
your neighbours should be safe,
but as it's landed on the floor,

16:42.940 --> 16:45.499
I am moved to wonder if
the cafe below is open.

16:45.500 --> 16:49.179
- It's Sunday morning, so it's closed.
- What about Mrs Hudson?

16:57.777 --> 17:00.819
Going by her usual routine, I estimate
she has another two minutes left.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.899
She keeps the vacuum cleaner
at the back of the flat.

17:02.900 --> 17:04.740
- So?
- So safer there, when

17:04.765 --> 17:06.579
she's putting it away.

17:06.579 --> 17:09.259
But we have to move eventually and
we should do it when she's safest.

17:09.260 --> 17:12.259
When the vacuum stops, we give her eight
seconds to get to the back of the flat.

17:12.260 --> 17:14.259
She's fast when she's
cleaning. Then we move.

17:14.260 --> 17:17.259
What's the trigger response time?

17:17.260 --> 17:20.219
Once we're mobile, how
long before detonation?

17:20.220 --> 17:23.459
We have a maximum of three
seconds to vacate the blast radius.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.659
John and I will take the
windows, you take the stairs.

17:25.660 --> 17:27.179
- Help get Mrs Hudson out, too.
- Me?

17:27.180 --> 17:29.139
- You're closer.
- You're faster.

17:29.140 --> 17:31.579
Speed differential won't be
as critical as the distance.

17:31.580 --> 17:33.699
Yes, agreed.

17:33.700 --> 17:36.739
She's further away.
She's moving to the back.

17:36.740 --> 17:38.979
I estimate we have a minute left.

17:38.980 --> 17:41.179
- Is a phone call possible?
- Phone call?

17:41.180 --> 17:43.899
John has a daughter, he
may wish to say goodbye.

17:43.900 --> 17:47.995
I'm sorry, Dr Watson, any movement will
set off the grenade. I hope you understand.

17:49.036 --> 17:50.835
Oscar Wilde.

17:50.860 --> 17:51.962
What?

17:51.963 --> 17:56.315
He said, "The truth is
rarely pure and never simple".

17:56.340 --> 17:59.099
It's from The Importance Of Being
Earnest. We did it at school.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.204
So did we, now I recall.

18:02.300 --> 18:03.899
I was Lady Bracknell.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.179
Yeah. You were great.

18:06.180 --> 18:08.779
- You really think so?
- Yes, I really do.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.779
Well, that's good to know.

18:10.780 --> 18:12.660
I've always wondered.

18:18.950 --> 18:20.510
Good luck, boys.

18:21.907 --> 18:25.460
Three, two, one, go!

18:55.380 --> 18:57.659
'And now the shipping forecast,
issued by the Met Office

18:57.660 --> 19:02.899
'on behalf of the Maritime
Coastguard Agency at 05.05.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.107
'Thames, Dover...'

19:05.132 --> 19:07.012
Go on, son, get it up.

19:08.020 --> 19:09.339
Better out than in.

19:09.340 --> 19:10.979
Is it always like this?

19:10.980 --> 19:13.219
- No.
- Thank God!

19:13.220 --> 19:15.579
Usually, it's much worse.

19:15.580 --> 19:17.589
I might go and work in a bank!

19:19.340 --> 19:20.780
Is that an helicopter?

19:22.065 --> 19:24.579
No, not in this weather.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.019
'...Shannon, Malin, Sherrinford.

19:27.020 --> 19:28.659
'Sherrinford.

19:28.660 --> 19:29.899
'Sherrinford.'

19:29.900 --> 19:31.939
- Do you hear that?
- 'Sherrinford.'

19:31.940 --> 19:34.299
I never heard that one before.

19:34.300 --> 19:35.979
Sherrinford?

19:35.980 --> 19:37.163
Forget you ever heard it.

19:37.188 --> 19:37.955
What?

19:37.980 --> 19:41.859
Sometimes when we're out in
these waters, we get that message.

19:41.860 --> 19:43.499
Just forget about it.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.220
- Yeah, but we've never...
- Just...!

19:57.740 --> 20:00.139
- Who the hell are you?!
- My name's Sherlock Holmes.

20:00.140 --> 20:01.619
The detective.

20:01.620 --> 20:03.390
The pirate.

20:20.180 --> 20:22.899
Golf Whiskey X-ray, this
is a restricted area.

20:22.900 --> 20:24.339
Repeat, restricted area.

20:24.340 --> 20:27.259
You are off course. Are you receiving?

20:27.260 --> 20:29.619
Golf Whiskey X-ray, you are
off course. Are you receiving?

20:29.620 --> 20:32.379
'We are receiving you.
This is a distress call.

20:32.380 --> 20:34.819
'Repeat, distress call.
We're in trouble here.'

20:34.820 --> 20:37.220
Golf Whiskey X-ray,
what is your situation?

20:38.820 --> 20:41.739
Golf Whiskey X-ray, where are you now?

20:41.740 --> 20:44.100
'We're headed for the
rocks, we're going to hit!'

20:46.100 --> 20:48.699
Governor to the control room!

20:48.700 --> 20:52.339
'Lockdown in progress!
Lockdown in progress!

20:52.340 --> 20:55.499
'Please proceed to
designated red stations.

20:55.500 --> 21:00.019
'Please proceed to
designated red stations.'

21:06.027 --> 21:08.859
- Hold it! Wait, wait, wait!
- Wait! Wait!

21:08.860 --> 21:12.380
In the sand! In the sand!

21:17.980 --> 21:19.859
I need to speak to Mycroft.

21:19.860 --> 21:21.859
He's in hospital,
there was an explosion.

21:21.860 --> 21:23.339
Put me through to the hospital.

21:23.340 --> 21:25.819
He's not conscious.
He's severely injured.

21:25.820 --> 21:28.659
No-one is even confident
he's going to pull through.

21:28.660 --> 21:31.019
Where's his brother?
Where's Sherlock Holmes?

21:31.020 --> 21:32.219
Missing.

21:32.220 --> 21:34.139
No, he's not, he's here!

21:34.140 --> 21:36.419
Sir, we found two more from the boat.

21:36.420 --> 21:40.259
'He stole our boat! Him and
another fella, with guns!'

21:40.260 --> 21:43.900
- Where'd you find them?
- 'North side of the island, sir.'

21:46.753 --> 21:49.259
- Holding cell, now!
- 'Right, sir.'

21:49.260 --> 21:51.820
'Lockdown in progress.'

21:55.220 --> 21:57.099
This is a mistake!

21:57.100 --> 22:00.539
I'm the victim here, this man
stole my boat! He's a pirate.

22:00.540 --> 22:02.819
- Yeah, I really am.
- Please, sit down.

22:02.820 --> 22:04.379
I don't even know who he is!

22:04.380 --> 22:08.379
He's Dr John Watson, formerly of
the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.

22:08.380 --> 22:10.819
- What are you doing here?
- It's a hospital. Any work?

22:10.820 --> 22:12.219
It's not a hospital.

22:12.220 --> 22:13.859
I want eyes on Eurus Holmes.

22:13.860 --> 22:15.579
Go straight to the special unit,

22:15.580 --> 22:18.319
deploy green and yellow
shift, on my authority.

22:18.344 --> 22:19.459
Sir.

22:23.580 --> 22:27.059
I'm sparing your blushes because
we're supposed to be on the same side.

22:27.060 --> 22:29.179
And frankly, this is embarrassing.

22:29.180 --> 22:31.219
Ooh. Doing a cavity search?

22:31.220 --> 22:33.979
The true art of disguise,
according to your famous friend,

22:33.980 --> 22:35.579
is not being looked at.

22:35.580 --> 22:38.842
But I am looking at
you, aren't I, Mr Holmes?

22:39.732 --> 22:41.779
Yes, you are.

22:41.780 --> 22:44.340
But that is sort of the point, isn't it?

22:46.058 --> 22:49.459
You see, you should have been looking
at the guy you just gave your pass to.

22:49.460 --> 22:51.220
Ah!

23:00.344 --> 23:02.779
That's the trouble with
uniforms and name badges,

23:02.780 --> 23:05.019
people stop looking at faces.

23:05.020 --> 23:06.819
We'd be better off with clown outfits.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.939
At least they'd be satirically relevant.

23:08.940 --> 23:12.379
Oh, you'll find the real Landers on the
north shore, tied up with two others.

23:12.380 --> 23:14.779
- Two others?
- Hm. Well, it was trial and error.

23:14.780 --> 23:16.459
We had to find the right waistband.

23:16.460 --> 23:18.619
This is insane! This is unnecessary.

23:18.620 --> 23:21.219
No, your security is compromised
and we don't know who to trust.

23:21.220 --> 23:22.739
And that justifies dressing up?

23:22.740 --> 23:24.300
Yes, it does!

23:25.980 --> 23:28.659
It justifies dressing up or
any damn thing I say it does!

23:28.660 --> 23:32.459
Now, listen to me, for your own
physical safety, do not speak.

23:32.460 --> 23:35.019
Do not indulge in any non-verbal signals

23:35.020 --> 23:37.339
suggestive of internal thought!

23:37.340 --> 23:39.379
If the safety of my
sister is compromised,

23:39.380 --> 23:41.699
if the security of my
sister is compromised,

23:41.700 --> 23:44.579
if the incarceration of
my sister is compromised,

23:44.580 --> 23:48.979
in short, if I find any indication my
sister has left this island at any time,

23:48.980 --> 23:51.180
I swear to you, you will not!

23:54.020 --> 23:56.419
- Say thank you to Dr Watson.
- Why?

23:56.420 --> 23:59.379
He talked me out of Lady Bracknell.
This could have been very different.

23:59.380 --> 24:00.939
Are you in?

24:00.940 --> 24:03.539
Just arriving at the
secure unit. Explain.

24:03.540 --> 24:05.179
'Door opening.'

24:05.180 --> 24:06.859
Prison within a prison.

24:06.884 --> 24:10.595
Eurus must be allowed the strict
minimum of human interaction.

24:10.620 --> 24:12.371
- Why?
- Since you're determined to

24:12.396 --> 24:14.484
meet her, you're about to find out.

24:16.393 --> 24:19.939
Eyes on Eurus Holmes. Governor's orders.

24:19.940 --> 24:21.099
Answer yes or no.

24:21.100 --> 24:24.059
Has there ever been, against
my express instructions,

24:24.060 --> 24:27.579
any attempt at a psychiatric
evaluation of Eurus Holmes?

24:27.580 --> 24:30.259
- Yes.
- I presume the tapes are in my office.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.752
- Your office?
- Cast your mind

24:31.777 --> 24:33.324
back. It used to be yours.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.499
You haven't been down
here before, have you?

24:36.500 --> 24:38.299
Silence Of The Lambs, basically.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.819
- You what?
- Keep your distance.

24:39.820 --> 24:42.579
Stay at least three feet away
from the glass, and all that.

24:42.580 --> 24:44.059
Why the headphones?

24:44.060 --> 24:46.339
She doesn't stop playing.
Sometimes for weeks.

24:46.340 --> 24:47.819
Beautiful.

24:47.820 --> 24:51.140
- Kills you in the end.
- Aye, still beautiful, though.

24:53.780 --> 24:55.740
'Door closing.'

25:42.388 --> 25:44.667
'Why am I here?

25:44.692 --> 25:46.208
'Why do you think you're here?

25:46.233 --> 25:48.739
'No-one ever tells me.'

25:59.020 --> 26:01.619
- 'Am I being punished?
- You've been bad.

26:01.620 --> 26:03.619
'There's no such thing as bad.

26:03.620 --> 26:06.179
- 'What about good?
- Good and bad are fairytales.

26:06.180 --> 26:09.019
'We have evolved to attach
an emotional significance

26:09.020 --> 26:12.619
'to what is nothing more than a
survival strategy of the pack animal.

26:12.620 --> 26:15.139
'We are conditioned to
invest divinity in utility.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.299
'Good isn't really good,
evil isn't really wrong,

26:17.300 --> 26:20.539
'bottoms aren't really pretty. You
are a prisoner of your own meat.

26:20.540 --> 26:22.259
'Why aren't you?

26:22.260 --> 26:24.779
'I'm too clever.'

26:30.820 --> 26:33.299
- Did you bring it?
- Sorry?

26:33.300 --> 26:35.859
My hairband. Did you
bring it, like I asked?

26:35.860 --> 26:39.019
I'm not one of the...
I-I don't work here.

26:39.020 --> 26:40.979
My special hairband.

26:40.980 --> 26:43.339
I'm not one of your doctors.

26:43.340 --> 26:47.033
The one I made you steal from Mummy.

26:50.940 --> 26:53.179
It was the last thing
I said to you, remember?

26:53.180 --> 26:55.219
The day they took me away.

26:55.220 --> 26:56.438
No.

26:56.463 --> 26:58.499
- No?
- We've spoken since then.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.259
You came round to my
flat a few weeks back,

27:00.260 --> 27:03.619
you pretended to be a woman
called Faith Smith. We had chips.

27:03.620 --> 27:05.419
Does this mean you
didn't bring my hairband?

27:05.420 --> 27:08.939
How did you manage to get out of
this place? How did you do that?

27:08.940 --> 27:11.419
Easy. Look at me.

27:11.420 --> 27:13.379
I am looking at you.

27:13.380 --> 27:15.539
You can't see it, can you?

27:15.540 --> 27:19.219
You try and try, but you just
can't see, you can't look.

27:19.220 --> 27:20.939
See what?

27:20.940 --> 27:23.019
- What do you think?
- Beautiful.

27:23.020 --> 27:25.699
- You're not looking at it.
- I meant your playing.

27:25.700 --> 27:26.899
Oh, the music!

27:26.900 --> 27:29.659
I never know if it's beautiful
or not, only if it's right.

27:29.660 --> 27:31.859
Often they're the same thing.

27:31.860 --> 27:33.659
If they're not always
the same thing, what's

27:33.684 --> 27:35.299
the point in beauty? Look at the violin.

27:35.300 --> 27:37.179
I need to know how you escaped.

27:37.180 --> 27:38.620
Look at the violin.

27:42.180 --> 27:44.739
- It's a Stradivarius.
- It's a gift.

27:44.740 --> 27:46.860
- Who from?
- Me.

28:05.020 --> 28:07.420
- Why?
- You play, don't you?

28:08.775 --> 28:10.300
How did you know?

28:12.820 --> 28:14.260
How did I know?

28:15.447 --> 28:19.139
I taught you. Don't you remember?
How can you not remember that?

28:19.164 --> 28:21.363
Eurus, I don't remember you at all.

28:21.388 --> 28:22.948
Interesting.

28:24.140 --> 28:26.179
Mycroft told me you'd
rewritten your memories,

28:26.180 --> 28:28.379
he didn't tell me you'd
written me out completely.

28:28.380 --> 28:30.339
What do you mean, rewritten?

28:30.340 --> 28:33.419
You still don't know
about Redbeard, do you?

28:33.420 --> 28:37.259
Oh! This is going to be such a good day.

28:37.260 --> 28:38.939
'She smiles at you
when you come home...'

28:38.940 --> 28:42.059
Everyone we sent in there,
it's hard to describe,

28:42.060 --> 28:44.579
- it's... it's like she...
- Recruited them.

28:44.580 --> 28:46.379
'Smiling is advertising.'

28:46.380 --> 28:47.859
Enslaved them.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.579
She's been capable of
that since she was five.

28:50.580 --> 28:52.579
She's an adult now.

28:52.580 --> 28:55.421
I warned you. I ordered you.

28:56.260 --> 28:58.499
She's clinically unique. We had to try.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.139
At what cost?

29:00.140 --> 29:03.579
'Happiness is a pop
song. Sadness is a poem.'

29:03.580 --> 29:04.940
What cost?

29:06.580 --> 29:09.579
Tell me the worst
thing that has happened.

29:09.580 --> 29:13.659
She kept suggesting to Dr Taylor
that he should kill his family.

29:13.660 --> 29:16.059
- And?
- He said it was like an earworm,

29:16.060 --> 29:17.379
couldn't get her out of his head.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.859
- And?
- He left.

29:19.860 --> 29:22.700
- And?
- Killed himself.

29:23.700 --> 29:25.499
And?

29:25.500 --> 29:27.419
His family.

29:27.420 --> 29:28.940
'Are you going to cry?

29:30.980 --> 29:32.699
'It's OK if you cry.

29:32.700 --> 29:34.259
'I don't want to cry.

29:34.260 --> 29:35.700
'I can help you cry.'

29:37.860 --> 29:39.388
- Play for me.
- I need to know

29:39.413 --> 29:40.859
how you got out of here.

29:40.860 --> 29:44.220
You know already! Look
at me. Look and play.

29:52.460 --> 29:55.801
No, not Bach. You clearly
don't understand it. Play you.

29:56.860 --> 29:59.401
- Me?
- You.

30:03.620 --> 30:05.739
Oh! Have you had sex?

30:05.740 --> 30:07.379
Why do you ask?

30:07.380 --> 30:09.135
The music. I've had sex.

30:09.160 --> 30:10.267
How?

30:10.292 --> 30:12.179
One of the nurses
got careless. I liked it.

30:12.180 --> 30:14.059
Messy, though. People are so breakable.

30:14.060 --> 30:15.699
I take it he didn't consent.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.059
- He?
- She?

30:17.060 --> 30:19.059
Afraid I didn't notice
in the heat of the moment.

30:19.060 --> 30:22.939
And afterwards, well,
you couldn't really tell.

30:22.940 --> 30:25.740
Is that vibrato, or
is your hand shaking?

30:30.540 --> 30:33.539
I warned you explicitly,
no-one was to talk to her alone.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.659
- You spoke to her.
- I know what I'm doing!

30:35.660 --> 30:38.419
You even brought her a
visitor on Christmas Day.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.059
I took a calculated risk.

30:40.060 --> 30:42.579
You gave her a Christmas present.

30:42.580 --> 30:44.179
Remember her Christmas present?

30:44.180 --> 30:47.099
I am aware of the dangers Eurus poses

30:47.100 --> 30:48.819
and equipped to deal with them.

30:48.820 --> 30:50.099
What dangers?

30:50.100 --> 30:55.939
Eurus doesn't just talk to
people, she... reprograms them.

30:55.940 --> 30:59.580
Anyone who spends time with her
is automatically compromised.

31:01.300 --> 31:03.539
'I'm only trying to help
you. We can help each other.

31:03.540 --> 31:06.619
'Helping someone is the best
way you can help yourself.

31:06.620 --> 31:08.499
'I don't trust you.'

31:08.500 --> 31:11.099
So, clearly you remember me?

31:11.100 --> 31:13.139
I remember everything.
Every single thing.

31:13.140 --> 31:15.539
You just need a big enough hard drive.

31:15.540 --> 31:18.059
- 'Sherlock?'
- Not now.

31:18.060 --> 31:20.859
- 'Vatican Cameos.'
- In a minute.

31:20.860 --> 31:23.339
Let's continue.

31:23.340 --> 31:25.459
Did they tell you to keep
three feet from the glass?

31:25.460 --> 31:28.579
- Yes.
- Be naughty, step closer.

31:28.580 --> 31:31.460
- Why?
- Do it. Step closer.

31:35.420 --> 31:37.179
Tell me what you remember.

31:37.180 --> 31:40.099
You, me and Mycroft.

31:40.100 --> 31:44.019
Mycroft was quite clever. He could
understand things if you went a bit slow,

31:44.020 --> 31:47.579
but you, you were my favourite.

31:47.580 --> 31:50.019
Why was I your favourite?

31:50.020 --> 31:52.899
Because I could make you laugh.
I loved it when you laughed.

31:52.900 --> 31:56.099
Once, I made you laugh all night,
I thought you were going to burst.

31:56.100 --> 31:57.819
I was so happy.

31:57.820 --> 32:00.259
Then Mummy and Daddy had
to stop me, of course.

32:00.260 --> 32:03.339
- Why?
- Well, turns out I'd got it wrong.

32:03.340 --> 32:05.299
Apparently, you were screaming.

32:05.300 --> 32:07.139
Why was I screaming?

32:12.020 --> 32:13.100
Redbeard!

32:17.180 --> 32:20.019
- I remember Redbeard.
- Do you now?

32:20.020 --> 32:22.057
Tell me what I don't know.

32:23.580 --> 32:25.220
Touch the glass.

32:27.940 --> 32:29.739
I put my trust in
you, my implicit trust,

32:29.740 --> 32:32.539
as governor of this institute!

32:43.620 --> 32:45.139
It's obvious when it all started.

32:45.140 --> 32:47.619
Well, she was never the
same after that Christmas.

32:47.620 --> 32:48.939
It's as if you woke her up.

32:48.940 --> 32:50.499
That is entirely beside the point!

32:50.500 --> 32:52.979
- You had your orders and failed to
act on them. - Listen to the tape.

32:52.980 --> 32:55.020
- Sorry?
- Do it now, listen.

32:56.260 --> 32:59.219
- My sister's methods of...
- Just listen.

32:59.220 --> 33:01.179
'You have no idea how I could help.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.339
'Bring me your wife. I want to meet her.

33:03.340 --> 33:04.659
'I don't need your help.'

33:04.660 --> 33:06.859
Redbeard was my dog.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.859
I know what happened to Redbeard.

33:08.860 --> 33:12.979
Oh, Sherlock, you know nothing.

33:12.980 --> 33:15.686
Touch the glass and
I'll tell you the truth.

33:18.820 --> 33:21.499
I'll touch it, too, if you're scared.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.739
'I can fix her for you and then
I'll give you her straight back,

33:24.740 --> 33:26.899
'good as new, I promise.

33:26.900 --> 33:31.899
'That's all. What you're proposing
is not... It's not... right.'

33:31.900 --> 33:34.179
Everyone who went in there got affected.

33:34.180 --> 33:36.219
- Enslaved, you said.
- Yes.

33:36.220 --> 33:38.779
- One after the other?
- Yes.

33:38.780 --> 33:41.099
- Dr Watson, I think we've...
- Shut up!

33:41.100 --> 33:42.619
'Do you trust your wife?'

33:42.620 --> 33:44.659
One question, that's
your voice, isn't it?

33:44.660 --> 33:46.059
'Do you really? Do you trust her?

33:46.060 --> 33:47.979
'You've got to stop
saying these things.'

33:47.980 --> 33:51.459
If Eurus has enslaved you, then who
exactly is in charge of this prison?

33:51.460 --> 33:54.379
'It's completely inappropriate.'

33:54.380 --> 33:56.299
I'm sorry.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.099
- No!
- Very, very sorry.

33:58.100 --> 33:59.860
No!

34:10.060 --> 34:12.379
You think it's a trick.

34:12.380 --> 34:15.859
You look so unsure.

34:15.860 --> 34:18.059
You're not used to
being unsure, are you?

34:18.060 --> 34:20.018
It's more common than you'd think.

34:20.020 --> 34:21.540
Look at you.

34:23.420 --> 34:26.099
The man who sees through everything

34:26.100 --> 34:29.243
is exactly the man who doesn't notice...

34:30.446 --> 34:33.565
...when there's nothing to see through.

34:37.340 --> 34:40.780
Do you see how it was done?
I know you like explanations.

34:42.980 --> 34:45.099
The signs, you suspended the signs!

34:45.100 --> 34:47.059
And my voice? Throat mic.

34:47.060 --> 34:48.458
Puts me through the speakers.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.458
Don't you think it's clever?

34:50.460 --> 34:53.458
- Simple, but clever.
- Transparent.

34:53.460 --> 34:57.477
Well, you do keep asking
me how I got out of here.

35:01.020 --> 35:03.419
Like this.

35:03.420 --> 35:05.459
Ooof! Argh!

35:05.460 --> 35:08.099
A-A-A-A-A-A-Argh!

35:08.100 --> 35:12.059
Get in here, all of
you! Stop me killing him!

35:12.060 --> 35:14.419
No, no, stop me in a minute.

35:14.420 --> 35:16.700
A-A-A-A-A-A-Argh!

35:17.591 --> 35:19.419
Oh!

35:19.420 --> 35:21.099
'Red alert! Red alert!

35:21.100 --> 35:22.899
'Big, red, bouncy, red alert!'

35:22.900 --> 35:24.979
- Dr Watson...!
- 'Klingons attacking lower decks!

35:24.980 --> 35:27.699
'Also cowboys in black
hats and Darth Vader.

35:27.700 --> 35:30.779
'Don't be alarmed! I'm
here now, I'm here now!

35:30.780 --> 35:32.539
'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

35:32.540 --> 35:34.139
'Miss me? Miss me?

35:34.140 --> 35:35.659
'Miss me? Miss me?

35:35.660 --> 35:38.859
'Miss me? Miss me? Miss me? Miss me?

35:38.860 --> 35:42.459
'Miss me? Miss me? Miss me? Miss me...?'

36:42.180 --> 36:44.819
- Mr Moriarty.
- Big G.

36:44.820 --> 36:49.059
Big G means Governor. Street speak.

36:49.060 --> 36:52.499
I'm a bit down with the kids, you know.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.299
I'm relatable that way.

36:54.300 --> 36:56.459
Do you like my boys?

36:56.460 --> 37:02.220
This one's got more stamina, but
he's less caring in the afterglow.

37:03.928 --> 37:05.448
This way, please.

37:22.353 --> 37:24.832
Smell all that insane criminality.

37:26.180 --> 37:27.579
Do you have cannibals here?

37:27.580 --> 37:30.462
- Yes. Three.
- How many? That's good.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.339
People leave their bodies to science,

37:33.340 --> 37:36.140
I think cannibals would
be so much more grateful.

37:42.860 --> 37:44.660
Ah!

37:59.242 --> 38:01.549
_

38:01.574 --> 38:05.406
_

38:06.140 --> 38:08.259
Ah! Isn't that sweet?

38:08.260 --> 38:09.939
Won't you sit down?

38:09.940 --> 38:13.130
I wrote my own version of the
Nativity when I was a child.

38:13.155 --> 38:14.339
The Hungry Donkey.

38:14.340 --> 38:18.619
It was a bit gory, but if you're
going to put a baby in a manger,

38:18.620 --> 38:20.463
you're asking for trouble.

38:22.740 --> 38:24.511
You know what this
place is, of course?

38:24.536 --> 38:25.633
Of course.

38:27.260 --> 38:28.819
So, am I under arrest again?

38:28.820 --> 38:30.539
You remain a person of interest,

38:30.540 --> 38:32.539
but until you commit a verifiable crime,

38:32.540 --> 38:34.899
you are, I regret, at liberty.

38:34.900 --> 38:37.619
- Then why am I here?
- You're a Christmas present.

38:37.620 --> 38:40.380
Ah. How do you want me?

38:41.380 --> 38:43.299
There is, in this facility,

38:43.300 --> 38:45.939
a prisoner whose intellectual abilities

38:45.940 --> 38:48.739
are of occasional use to
the British government.

38:48.740 --> 38:52.499
What, for, like, really difficult sums,
long division, that sort of thing?

38:52.500 --> 38:55.699
She predicted the exact dates of
the last three terrorist attacks

38:55.700 --> 38:58.299
on the British mainland
after an hour on Twitter.

38:58.300 --> 39:00.259
That sort of thing.

39:00.260 --> 39:04.099
In return, however, she requires treats.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.939
Last year, it was a violin.

39:05.940 --> 39:07.180
This year?

39:08.380 --> 39:13.698
Five minutes unsupervised
conversation... with you.

39:14.860 --> 39:16.860
Me?

39:19.500 --> 39:21.059
With me?

39:21.060 --> 39:24.739
She has noted your interest in the
activities of my little brother.

39:24.740 --> 39:30.460
So, what has she got to
do with Sherlock Holmes?

39:34.224 --> 39:36.144
Whatever you're about to tell me...

39:37.540 --> 39:41.540
...I already know it's
going to be... awesome!

40:08.200 --> 40:09.940
I'm your Christmas present.

40:18.866 --> 40:20.346
So, what's mine?

40:28.420 --> 40:30.060
Redbeard.

40:55.060 --> 40:56.660
How are you?

40:58.700 --> 41:01.460
- Bit of a lump.
- True, that, but you have your uses.

41:02.780 --> 41:05.219
- Did you see your sister?
- Yes.

41:05.220 --> 41:07.739
- How was that?
- Family is always difficult.

41:07.740 --> 41:10.299
Is this an occasion for banter?

41:10.300 --> 41:11.819
Case in point.

41:12.900 --> 41:15.499
- Are we phoning someone?
- Apparently.

41:15.500 --> 41:17.659
- What's he doing here?
- As he is told.

41:17.660 --> 41:19.659
Eurus is in control.

41:20.940 --> 41:24.619
Help me. Please, I'm on a
plane and everyone's asleep!

41:24.620 --> 41:26.379
Help me!

41:26.380 --> 41:29.259
'Hello. My name's Jim Moriarty.

41:29.260 --> 41:33.379
'Welcome to the final problem.'

41:33.380 --> 41:36.179
- It's OK, he's dead.
- He doesn't sound dead.

41:36.180 --> 41:38.259
'This is a recorded announcement.

41:38.260 --> 41:41.419
'Please say hello to some
very old friends of mine.'

41:41.420 --> 41:43.699
Hello? I can hear you talking.

41:43.700 --> 41:46.419
'Please help me! I'm on a
plane and it's going to crash!'

41:46.420 --> 41:48.659
- What is this? We can't do this!
- Do shut up, dear.

41:48.660 --> 41:51.179
- 'Is someone there?!'
- Is this supposed to be a game?

41:51.180 --> 41:53.339
- Be quiet.
- 'Please help me!'

41:53.340 --> 41:57.379
Oh, hello. Um...
try... try to stay calm.

41:57.380 --> 41:59.899
Just... tell me... tell
me what your name is.

41:59.900 --> 42:01.659
I'm not supposed to tell
my name to strangers.

42:01.660 --> 42:04.619
Of course not, very good.
But, um... I'll tell you mine.

42:04.620 --> 42:07.299
My name is...

42:07.300 --> 42:09.019
Hello?

42:09.020 --> 42:12.146
Oh, dear. We seem to
have lost the connection.

42:13.340 --> 42:15.499
How have you done this?
How is any of this possible?

42:15.500 --> 42:19.396
You put me in here, Mycroft,
you brought me my treats.

42:20.300 --> 42:21.700
What treats?

42:27.060 --> 42:29.299
'Clever, Eurus! You go, girl!'

42:29.300 --> 42:31.539
How can that be Moriarty?

42:31.540 --> 42:36.179
Oh, he recorded lots of little
messages for me before he died.

42:36.180 --> 42:39.099
Loved it. Did you know his
brother was a stationmaster?

42:39.100 --> 42:40.939
I think he was always jealous.

42:40.940 --> 42:42.859
The girl, where is she?

42:42.860 --> 42:44.619
Can I talk to her again?

42:44.620 --> 42:46.139
Poor little thing.

42:46.140 --> 42:50.379
Alone in the sky in a great
big plane with nowhere to land.

42:50.380 --> 42:52.139
But where in the world is she?

42:52.140 --> 42:53.699
It's a clever little puzzle.

42:53.700 --> 42:56.864
If you want to apply yourself
to it, I can reconnect you,

42:56.889 --> 42:58.369
but first...

43:02.420 --> 43:04.579
That's my wife.

43:04.580 --> 43:06.035
That's my wife!

43:07.940 --> 43:09.579
Oh, God, that's my wife!

43:09.580 --> 43:11.139
I'm going to shoot the governor's wife.

43:11.140 --> 43:13.299
Please! No!

43:13.300 --> 43:14.979
Please! Help her!

43:14.980 --> 43:19.299
In about a minute... bang! Dead!

43:19.300 --> 43:22.459
- Please don't do that.
- Well, you can stop me.

43:22.460 --> 43:25.594
- How?
- There's a gun in the hatch. Take it.

43:30.140 --> 43:31.899
You want to save the governor's wife,

43:31.900 --> 43:35.079
choose either Dr Watson or
Mycroft to kill the governor.

43:35.104 --> 43:37.384
Oh! Oh, God!

43:40.800 --> 43:44.099
You can't do it, Sherlock. If you do it,
it won't count. I'll kill her, anyway.

43:44.100 --> 43:47.268
It has to be your
brother or your friend.

43:48.620 --> 43:50.380
You have to do this.

43:51.820 --> 43:53.260
Eurus will kill her!

43:56.161 --> 43:57.859
It doesn't appear we have a choice.

43:57.860 --> 44:00.778
Right, then. Countdown's starting.

44:02.130 --> 44:03.269
How long?

44:03.294 --> 44:05.859
No, no, no, the countdown is for me.

44:05.860 --> 44:09.659
Withholding the precise deadline will
apply the emotional pressure more evenly.

44:09.660 --> 44:14.419
Where possible, please give me an explicit
verbal indication of your anxiety levels,

44:14.420 --> 44:16.819
I can't always read
them from your behaviour.

44:16.820 --> 44:18.819
I can't do this.

44:18.820 --> 44:20.619
I can't, it's murder.

44:20.620 --> 44:23.379
This is not murder,
this is saving my wife.

44:23.380 --> 44:26.339
I'm particularly focused
on internal conflicts,

44:26.340 --> 44:29.699
where strategising around a
largely-intuitive moral code

44:29.700 --> 44:32.659
appears to create a
counterintuitive result.

44:32.660 --> 44:34.499
I will not kill.

44:34.500 --> 44:36.459
I will not have blood on my hands!

44:36.460 --> 44:38.539
Yes, very good. Thank you.

44:38.540 --> 44:40.739
Killing my wife is what you are doing.

44:40.740 --> 44:42.260
No!

44:45.540 --> 44:47.020
OK, fine.

44:48.460 --> 44:50.100
John?

44:52.420 --> 44:54.459
Dr Watson, are you married?

44:54.460 --> 44:55.859
I was.

44:55.860 --> 44:58.660
- What happened?
- She died.

44:59.980 --> 45:01.939
What would you give to get her back?

45:01.964 --> 45:03.904
I mean, if you could,
if it was possible,

45:03.905 --> 45:05.619
what would you do to save her?

45:05.620 --> 45:07.899
Eurus will kill me.

45:07.900 --> 45:10.499
Please save my wife.

45:10.500 --> 45:13.059
There will, I'm afraid,
be regular prompts

45:13.060 --> 45:15.979
to create an atmosphere of urgency.

45:15.980 --> 45:18.699
'Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock.

45:18.700 --> 45:22.340
'Tick-tick-tick-tick,
tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.'

45:34.520 --> 45:35.999
What's your name?

45:36.000 --> 45:37.359
David.

45:37.360 --> 45:38.839
And you're sure about this, David?

45:38.840 --> 45:40.359
Of course I'm bloody sure!

45:40.384 --> 45:42.615
Nearly there.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.799
Right, do you want to pray or anything?

45:44.800 --> 45:48.160
With Eurus Holmes in the world,
who the hell would I pray to?

45:49.256 --> 45:51.719
You are a good man and
you are doing a good thing.

45:51.720 --> 45:53.039
So are you.

45:53.040 --> 45:55.360
I'll spend the rest of my
life telling myself that.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.480
Please!

46:23.739 --> 46:26.519
Oh, God!

46:26.520 --> 46:29.489
I know that you're scared, but
you should also be very proud.

46:29.514 --> 46:32.920
Just do it! Be quick!

46:34.760 --> 46:38.479
'Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.'

46:38.480 --> 46:40.839
This is very good, Dr Watson.

46:40.840 --> 46:42.719
I should have fitted
you with a cardiograph.

46:42.720 --> 46:44.360
Goodbye, David.

46:45.760 --> 46:49.240
'Tock-tock-tock-tock-tock-tock-tock,
tick-tick-tick.'

46:51.875 --> 46:54.759
Please!

46:54.760 --> 46:56.719
I can't. I'm sorry, I can't do it.

46:56.720 --> 46:59.359
I know, it's all right.

46:59.360 --> 47:01.240
Stop! No, no! Stop!

47:02.136 --> 47:03.679
I'm sorry.

47:03.680 --> 47:05.439
- It's all right.
- I'm so sorry!

47:05.440 --> 47:06.919
Remember me.

47:06.920 --> 47:08.960
No!

47:11.668 --> 47:13.347
Oh!

47:15.956 --> 47:18.011
Are you all right?

47:18.927 --> 47:20.487
Interesting.

47:21.640 --> 47:24.919
All right, there you go, you got
what you wanted, and he's dead.

47:24.920 --> 47:29.079
Dead or alive, he really
wasn't very interesting.

47:29.080 --> 47:32.359
But you three, you three were wonderful.

47:32.360 --> 47:34.040
Thank you.

47:35.320 --> 47:39.719
You see, what you did, Dr Watson,
specifically because of your moral code,

47:39.720 --> 47:42.039
because you don't want
blood on your hands,

47:42.040 --> 47:44.199
two people are dead instead of one.

47:44.200 --> 47:45.399
Two people?

47:45.400 --> 47:47.702
Yes. Sorry.

47:47.727 --> 47:49.247
Hang on.

47:52.600 --> 47:53.960
Oh!

48:01.160 --> 48:04.039
What advantage did your
moral code grant you?

48:04.040 --> 48:06.959
Is it not, in the end, selfish
to keep one's hands clean

48:06.960 --> 48:08.719
at the expense of another's life?

48:08.720 --> 48:10.439
You didn't have to kill her!

48:10.440 --> 48:13.319
Huh! The condition of her survival

48:13.320 --> 48:16.520
was that you or Mycroft
had to kill her husband.

48:17.600 --> 48:19.799
This is an experiment.

48:19.800 --> 48:21.719
There will be rigour.

48:21.720 --> 48:24.799
Sherlock, pick up the
gun. It's your turn next.

48:24.800 --> 48:27.519
When I tell you to use it, and I will,

48:27.520 --> 48:29.839
remember what happened this time.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.559
What if I don't want a gun?

48:31.560 --> 48:33.759
Oh, the gun is intended as a mercy.

48:33.760 --> 48:35.519
- For whom?
- You.

48:35.520 --> 48:37.659
- How so?
- If someone else had to die,

48:37.684 --> 48:40.095
would you really want to
do it with your bare hands?

48:40.120 --> 48:42.160
It would waste valuable time.

48:48.185 --> 48:49.985
Probably just take it.

48:56.880 --> 48:58.319
There's only one bullet left.

48:58.320 --> 49:00.079
You will only need one.

49:00.080 --> 49:02.919
But you will need it.

49:05.160 --> 49:07.359
Please, go through.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.719
There's a few tasks for you

49:08.720 --> 49:13.085
and a girl on a plane is
getting very, very scared.

49:17.539 --> 49:18.858
Treats?

49:18.883 --> 49:22.359
Yes. You know, a violin.

49:22.360 --> 49:24.439
In exchange for?

49:24.440 --> 49:26.119
She's very clever.

49:26.120 --> 49:28.318
I'm beginning to think you're not.

49:29.065 --> 49:32.744
'Come on now, all aboard!

49:32.769 --> 49:37.639
'Choo-choo! Choo-choo! Choo-choo!

49:37.640 --> 49:41.439
'Choo-choo! Choo-choo!

49:41.440 --> 49:43.679
'Choo-choo!

49:43.680 --> 49:47.199
'Choo-choo! Choo-choo!'

49:47.200 --> 49:49.359
Someone's been redecorating.

49:49.360 --> 49:52.199
- Is that allowed?
- She's literally taken over the asylum,

49:52.200 --> 49:54.919
we have more to worry about
than her choice of colour scheme.

49:54.920 --> 49:57.199
Barely dry. Recent.

49:57.200 --> 49:59.039
And it's for our benefit.

49:59.040 --> 50:02.239
As a motivator to your
continued cooperation,

50:02.240 --> 50:04.759
I'm now reconnecting you.

50:04.760 --> 50:09.775
'Fasten your seatbelts, it's
going to be a bumpy night.'

50:09.800 --> 50:11.319
'Are... are you still there?'

50:11.320 --> 50:13.119
Yes, hello?

50:13.120 --> 50:15.399
Hello, we're still
here, can you hear us?

50:15.400 --> 50:17.359
- Yes.
- 'Everything is going to be all right,

50:17.360 --> 50:19.920
'I-I just need you to
tell me where you are.

50:19.945 --> 50:22.024
'Outside, is it day or night?'

50:22.049 --> 50:25.079
- Night. - That certainly narrows
it down to half the planet!

50:25.080 --> 50:27.479
- What kind of a plane are you on
- 'I don't know.'

50:27.480 --> 50:29.220
- Is it big or small?
- 'Big.'

50:29.245 --> 50:30.759
Lots of people on it?

50:30.760 --> 50:33.559
Lots and lots, but they're all
asleep, I can't wake them up.

50:33.560 --> 50:36.479
- Where did you take off from?
- 'And the driver's asleep.'

50:36.480 --> 50:39.439
No, I understand, but
where did you come from?

50:39.440 --> 50:40.839
'Where did the plane take off?'

50:40.840 --> 50:43.239
- My nan's.
- And where are you going?

50:43.240 --> 50:45.159
- 'Home.'
- No, I mean what airport...

50:45.160 --> 50:47.799
Enough for now. Time to play a new game.

50:47.800 --> 50:51.599
Look on the table in front
of you. Open the envelope.

50:51.600 --> 50:54.079
If you want to speak to the girl again,

50:54.080 --> 50:56.319
earn yourself some phone time!

50:56.320 --> 50:58.319
This is inhuman, this is insane!

50:58.320 --> 50:59.520
Mycroft, we know!

51:00.405 --> 51:03.404
Six months ago, a man
called Evans was murdered.

51:03.440 --> 51:05.280
Unsolved, except by me.

51:06.726 --> 51:10.240
He was shot from a distance
of 300 metres with this rifle.

51:11.440 --> 51:13.039
Now, if the police had any brains,

51:13.040 --> 51:15.799
they'd realise there are
three suspects, all brothers,

51:15.800 --> 51:20.039
Nathan Garrideb, Alex
Garrideb and Howard Garrideb.

51:20.040 --> 51:21.839
All these photos are up to date,

51:21.840 --> 51:26.599
but which one pulled
the trigger, Sherlock?

51:26.600 --> 51:28.204
Which one?

51:28.229 --> 51:32.199
What's this, we're supposed
to solve this based on what?

51:32.200 --> 51:33.519
This. This is all we get.

51:33.520 --> 51:36.319
Please, make use of
your friends, Sherlock.

51:36.320 --> 51:39.479
I want to see you interact with
people that you're close to.

51:39.480 --> 51:42.360
Also, you may have to
choose which one to keep.

51:43.920 --> 51:46.799
What do you make of it? Am I
being asked to prove my usefulness?

51:46.800 --> 51:47.999
Yes, I should think you are.

51:48.000 --> 51:49.999
I will not be manipulated like this.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.468
Fine. John? John!

51:53.720 --> 51:57.399
Yeah, I think I've seen one
of these. It's a buffalo gun.

51:57.400 --> 52:01.759
I'd say 1940s, old-fashioned
sight. No crosshairs.

52:01.760 --> 52:05.159
Glasses, glasses. Nathan wears glasses.

52:05.160 --> 52:07.799
Evans was shot from 300 metres.

52:07.800 --> 52:09.880
The kickback from a
gun with this calibre...

52:13.800 --> 52:15.359
...would be massive.

52:15.360 --> 52:17.279
No cuts, no scarring.

52:17.280 --> 52:18.919
It's not Nathan, then. Who's next?

52:18.920 --> 52:20.759
Well done, Dr Watson.
How useful you are.

52:20.760 --> 52:22.959
Do you have a suspicion
we're being made to compete?

52:22.960 --> 52:25.999
We're not competing. There's a plane
in the air that's going to crash,

52:26.000 --> 52:28.279
so what we're doing is
trying to save a little girl.

52:28.280 --> 52:30.879
Today, we have to be
soldiers, Mycroft, soldiers.

52:30.880 --> 52:33.040
And that means to hell
with what happens to us!

52:34.840 --> 52:36.319
Your priorities do you credit.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.559
No, my priorities just
got a woman killed.

52:38.560 --> 52:40.639
Now, as I understand it, Sherlock,

52:40.640 --> 52:43.679
you try to repress your emotions
to refine your reasoning.

52:43.680 --> 52:47.319
I'd like to see how that
works. So, if you don't mind,

52:47.320 --> 52:50.400
I'm going to apply some
context to your deductions.

52:52.880 --> 52:54.319
Oh, dear God!

52:54.320 --> 52:56.639
Two of the Garridebs
work here as orderlies,

52:56.640 --> 52:59.599
so getting the third along
really wasn't too difficult.

52:59.600 --> 53:05.159
Once you bring in your verdict, let
me know and justice will be done.

53:05.160 --> 53:07.039
- Justice?
- What will you do with them?

53:07.040 --> 53:08.719
Early release.

53:08.720 --> 53:10.119
You'll drop them into the sea.

53:10.120 --> 53:11.639
Sink or swim.

53:11.640 --> 53:13.039
They're tied up!

53:13.040 --> 53:15.439
Exactly! Now there is context.

53:15.440 --> 53:17.919
Please continue with your deductions.

53:17.920 --> 53:20.759
I'm now focusing on the
difference to your mental capacity

53:20.760 --> 53:22.879
a specified consequence can make.

53:22.880 --> 53:24.239
Why should we bother?

53:24.240 --> 53:27.399
What if we're disinclined to
play your games, little sister?

53:27.400 --> 53:30.799
Hm-hm! I have, if you remember,

53:30.800 --> 53:33.039
provided you with some motivation.

53:33.040 --> 53:36.159
'We're going through
the clouds, like cotton wool.'

53:36.160 --> 53:38.959
Oh, that's nice. Try to
tell me more about the plane.

53:38.960 --> 53:40.799
Why won't my mummy wake up?

53:44.581 --> 53:47.675
So it's got to be one of
the other two. Now, Howard...

53:48.600 --> 53:50.439
Howard's a lifelong
drunk, pallor of his skin,

53:50.440 --> 53:52.519
terminal gin blossoms on his red nose.

53:52.520 --> 53:55.480
And, terror notwithstanding,
a bad case of the DTs.

53:59.686 --> 54:02.599
There's no way he could have taken
that shot from 300 metres way.

54:02.600 --> 54:04.239
So that leaves us with Alex.

54:04.240 --> 54:06.999
Indentations on the temples
suggest he habitually wears glasses.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.919
Frown lines suggest
a lifetime of peering.

54:08.920 --> 54:10.359
He's short-sighted, or he was.

54:10.360 --> 54:12.239
His recent laser surgery
has done the trick.

54:12.240 --> 54:15.279
- Laser surgery? - Look at his
clothes, he's made an effort.

54:15.280 --> 54:17.239
- That's very good.
- Excellent.

54:17.240 --> 54:18.993
Suddenly he sees himself
in quite a different

54:19.017 --> 54:20.439
light now that he's
dumped the specs.

54:20.440 --> 54:21.759
He even has a spray tan.

54:21.760 --> 54:24.719
But he's clearly not used to
his new personal grooming ritual.

54:24.720 --> 54:26.777
That can be told by the state
of his fingernails and

54:26.802 --> 54:28.639
the fact that there's
hair growing in his ears.

54:28.640 --> 54:30.719
So it's a superficial job, then.

54:30.720 --> 54:32.759
But he got his eyes fixed,
his hands were steady.

54:32.760 --> 54:34.799
He pulled the trigger. He killed Evans.

54:34.800 --> 54:36.999
Are you ready to condemn the prisoner?

54:37.000 --> 54:38.799
Sherlock, we can't do this.

54:38.800 --> 54:40.199
The plane, remember?

54:40.200 --> 54:41.960
Sherlock, are you ready?

54:45.240 --> 54:46.799
Alex.

54:46.800 --> 54:49.799
Say it. Condemn him.

54:49.800 --> 54:53.480
Condemn him in the knowledge of
what will happen to the man you name.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.520
I condemn Alex Garrideb.

54:59.869 --> 55:01.668
'Mind the gap.'

55:01.693 --> 55:04.879
Congratulations, you got the right one.

55:04.880 --> 55:06.319
Now, go through the door.

55:06.320 --> 55:08.599
You dropped the other two, why?

55:08.600 --> 55:10.439
- Interesting.
- Why?!

55:10.440 --> 55:12.039
Does it really make a difference,

55:12.040 --> 55:14.479
killing the innocent
instead of the guilty?

55:14.480 --> 55:16.119
Let's see.

55:16.120 --> 55:19.359
'The train has left the station!'

55:19.360 --> 55:22.519
No. That felt pretty much the same.

55:22.520 --> 55:24.200
John?

55:24.225 --> 55:25.645
Don't let her distract you.

55:25.670 --> 55:27.311
- Distract me?
- Soldiers today.

55:50.696 --> 55:52.239
One more minute on the phone.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.319
'I'm frightened!
I'm really frightened!'

55:54.320 --> 55:56.519
It's OK, don't worry. I
don't have very long with you,

55:56.520 --> 55:59.479
so I just need you tell me what
you can see outside the plane.

55:59.480 --> 56:01.999
Just the sea. I can see the sea.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.439
- Are there ships on it?
- 'No ships.

56:04.440 --> 56:06.319
'I can see lights in the distance.'

56:06.320 --> 56:08.319
- Is it a city?
- 'I think so.'

56:08.320 --> 56:10.799
She's about to fly over a
city in a pilotless plane.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.159
We'll have to talk her through it.

56:12.160 --> 56:13.400
- Through what?
- 'Hello?

56:13.425 --> 56:14.759
Are you still there?'

56:14.760 --> 56:16.599
Still here. Just give us a minute.

56:16.600 --> 56:19.359
Getting the plane away from any
mainland, any populated areas.

56:19.360 --> 56:21.759
- It has to crash in the sea.
- What about the girl?

56:21.760 --> 56:25.039
Well, obviously, Dr Watson, she's
the one who's going to crash it.

56:25.040 --> 56:26.839
No. We could help her land it.

56:26.840 --> 56:29.079
And if we fail and she
crashes into a city?

56:29.080 --> 56:30.279
How many will die then?

56:30.280 --> 56:32.919
How are we going to get her to do that?

56:32.920 --> 56:35.119
I'm afraid we're going
to have to give her hope.

56:35.120 --> 56:37.199
Is there really no-one
there that can help you?

56:37.200 --> 56:39.319
Have you really, really checked?

56:39.320 --> 56:42.039
Everyone's asleep. Will you help me?

56:42.040 --> 56:43.639
We're going to do
everything that we can.

56:43.640 --> 56:45.679
'I'm scared. I'm really scared!'

56:45.680 --> 56:46.959
It's all right, I...

56:46.960 --> 56:50.279
Now, back to the
matter in hand. Coffin.

56:50.280 --> 56:52.919
Problem, someone is about to die.

56:52.920 --> 56:55.199
It will be, as I
understand it, a tragedy.

56:55.200 --> 56:56.919
So many days not lived,

56:56.920 --> 57:02.119
so many words unsaid, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera...

57:02.120 --> 57:04.599
Yes, yes, yes, and this, I
presume, will be their coffin.

57:04.600 --> 57:07.079
Whose coffin, Sherlock?

57:07.080 --> 57:09.759
Please, start your deductions.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.759
I will apply some context in a moment.

57:11.760 --> 57:14.879
Well, allowing for the entirely
pointless courtesy of headroom,

57:14.880 --> 57:18.119
I'd say this coffin is intended
for someone of about five foot four.

57:18.120 --> 57:19.959
- Makes it more likely to be a woman.
- Not a child?

57:19.960 --> 57:22.599
A child's would be more expensive.
This is in the lower price range,

57:22.600 --> 57:24.639
although still best
available in that bracket.

57:24.640 --> 57:26.199
That was a lonely night on Google.

57:26.200 --> 57:28.079
This is a practical and informed choice.

57:28.080 --> 57:30.919
The balance of probability suggests
that this is for an unmarried woman,

57:30.920 --> 57:32.479
distant from her close relatives.

57:32.480 --> 57:35.639
That is suggested by the economy of choice,
acquainted with the process of death,

57:35.640 --> 57:38.879
but unsentimental about the necessity
of disposal. The lining of the coffin...

57:38.880 --> 57:41.824
Yes, very good, Sherlock, or we could
just look at the name on the lid.

57:46.040 --> 57:47.439
Only it isn't a name.

57:47.440 --> 57:50.359
So it's for somebody who loves somebody.

57:50.360 --> 57:52.279
It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.

57:52.280 --> 57:54.560
This is all about you, everything here.

57:55.720 --> 57:57.359
So, who loves you?

57:57.360 --> 57:59.519
I'm assuming it's not a long list.

57:59.520 --> 58:02.729
Irene Adler. Don't be
ridiculous. Look at the coffin.

58:04.880 --> 58:07.918
Unmarried, practical about death, alone.

58:09.920 --> 58:11.959
- Molly.
- Molly Hooper.

58:11.960 --> 58:14.159
She's perfectly safe, for the moment.

58:14.160 --> 58:17.999
Her flat is rigged to explode
in approximately three minutes,

58:18.000 --> 58:20.359
unless I hear the release
code from her lips.

58:20.360 --> 58:22.999
I'm calling her on your phone, Sherlock.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.799
- Make her say it.
- Say what?

58:24.800 --> 58:26.276
Obvious, surely.

58:26.301 --> 58:27.284
- No.
- Yes.

58:30.200 --> 58:33.039
Oh, one important restriction,
you're not allowed to mention

58:33.040 --> 58:34.999
in any way at all that
her life is in danger.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.319
You may not, at any point, suggest
that there is any form of crisis.

58:38.320 --> 58:41.509
If you do, I will end
this session and her life.

58:41.534 --> 58:43.107
Are we clear?

58:43.132 --> 58:45.599
'Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock,

58:45.600 --> 58:48.159
'tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tick...'

58:57.280 --> 58:59.959
- What's she doing?
- She's making tea.

58:59.960 --> 59:01.599
But why isn't she answering her phone?

59:01.600 --> 59:02.839
You never answer your phone.

59:02.840 --> 59:04.720
Yes, but it's me calling.

59:09.602 --> 59:13.359
'Hi, this is Molly
at the dead centre of town.

59:13.360 --> 59:15.559
'Leave a message.'

59:15.560 --> 59:19.399
OK, OK. Just one more time.

59:23.440 --> 59:25.719
Go on, Molly, pick up.
Just bloody pick up.

59:37.040 --> 59:41.039
'Hello, Sherlock. Is this urgent?
Because I'm not having a good day.'

59:41.040 --> 59:44.719
Molly, I just want you to do something
very easy for me and not ask why.

59:44.720 --> 59:47.319
Oh, God! Is this one
of your stupid games?

59:47.320 --> 59:50.919
No, it's not a game.
I need you to help me.

59:50.920 --> 59:54.079
- Look, I'm not at the lab.
- It's not about that.

59:54.080 --> 59:56.360
Well, quickly, then.

59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.279
Sherlock! What is it, what do you want?

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.159
'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...'

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.559
Molly, please, without asking
why, just say these words.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:07.959
What words?

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.360
I love you.

01:00:10.864 --> 01:00:12.464
- Leave me alone.
- Molly, no, please,

01:00:12.489 --> 01:00:14.400
no! Don't hang up! Do not hang up!

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:17.479
Calmly, Sherlock, or I
will finish her right now.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.839
Why are you doing this to me?!

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.119
Why are you making fun of me?!

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.319
Please, I swear, you
just have to listen to me.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:24.199
Softer, Sherlock.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.119
Molly, this is for a case.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.999
It's... it's a sort of experiment.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.039
I'm not an experiment, Sherlock.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.599
No, I know you're not an
experiment, you're my friend.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.679
We're friends, but, please,
just say those words for me.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.439
Please don't do this.
Just... just... don't do it.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.519
It's very important.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.999
I can't say why.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.599
But I promise you, it is.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.759
I can't say that, I can't...
I can't say that to you.

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.799
Of course you can. Why can't you?

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.159
'You know why.'

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.959
No, I don't know why.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.719
Of course you do.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.439
'Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock,

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.159
'tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.'

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.044
Please, just say it.

01:01:06.419 --> 01:01:08.919
'I can't. Not to you.'

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.439
Why?

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.799
Because... because it's true.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.759
Because... it's true, Sherlock.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.089
It's always been true.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.640
Well, if it's true, just say it anyway.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.639
You bastard!

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.079
'Say it anyway.'

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:33.839
'You say it. Go on. You say it first.'

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.600
- What?
- Say it. Say it like you mean it.

01:01:39.238 --> 01:01:41.118
Final 30 seconds.

01:01:47.531 --> 01:01:48.771
I...

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.520
..I love you.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.920
I love you.

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.720
Molly?

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.000
Molly, please!

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.839
I love you.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.679
Sherlock, however hard that was...

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.880
Eurus, I won. I won.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.160
Come on, play fair. The girl on
the plane, I need to talk to her.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.279
I won! I saved Molly Hooper!

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.239
Huh!

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.479
Saved her? From what?

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.919
Oh, do be sensible, there were
no explosives in her little house.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.039
Why would I be so clumsy?

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.359
You didn't win, you lost.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.839
Look what you did to her.
Look what you did to yourself.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.879
All those complicated little
emotions, I lost count.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:05.199
Emotional context, Sherlock,
it destroys you every time.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:09.079
Now, please, pull yourself together.
I need you at peak efficiency.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.200
The next one isn't going to be so easy.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.240
In your own time.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.480
- Sherlock?
- No. No!

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.760
No! No! No! Argh!

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.439
No! No! No!

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:48.520
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Argh!

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.680
Hm-hm.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:11.999
I know this is difficult, and
I know you're being tortured,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.799
but you have got to keep it together.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:16.639
This isn't torture, this is vivisection.

01:04:16.664 --> 01:04:20.161
We're experiencing science from
the perspective of lab rats.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.480
Huh!

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.960
- Soldiers?
- Soldiers.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.679
'Tick-tock! Tickets, please!'

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.999
Hey, Sis, don't mean to
complain, but this one's empty.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.319
What happened, did you run out of ideas?

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.799
It's not empty, Sherlock. You've
still got the gun, haven't you?

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.679
I told you you'd need it, because
only two can play the next game.

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.799
Just two of you go on from here.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.679
Your choice, it's make-your-mind-up time.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:59.039
Whose help do you need
the most, John or Mycroft?

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.439
It's an elimination round.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.959
You choose one and kill the other.

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.239
You have to choose, family or friend.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.479
Mycroft or John Watson?

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.199
'Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick...'

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.319
- Eurus, enough!
- Not yet, I think, but nearly.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.280
Remember, there's a plane in the
sky and it's not going to land.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:23.999
- Well?
- Well, what?

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.279
We're not actually going
to discuss this, are we?

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:31.039
I'm sorry, Dr Watson, you're
a fine man in many respects.

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.960
Make your goodbyes and shoot him.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.559
- Shoot him!
- What?

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.799
Shoot Dr Watson.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:43.079
There's no question who has to
continue from here, it's us. You and me.

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.759
Whatever lies ahead requires
brainpower, Sherlock,

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.279
not sentiment.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.039
Don't prolong his agony, shoot him.

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.679
Do I get a say in this?

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:54.399
Today, we are soldiers.
Soldiers die for their country.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.560
I regret, Dr Watson, that
privilege is now yours.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.000
Shit, he's right.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.199
He is, in fact, right.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:08.399
Make it swift. No need
to prolong his agony.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.600
Get it over with and we can get to work.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.119
Huh! Hm-hm!

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.319
Oh, God! I should have expected this.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.959
Pathetic. You always were
the slow one. The idiot.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.679
That's why I've always despised you.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:28.759
You shame us all. You
shame the family name.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:31.839
Now, for once in your
life, do the right thing.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.879
Put this stupid little
man out of all our misery.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.159
Shoot him!

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.639
- Stop it.
- Look at him. What is he?

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.399
Nothing more than a distraction,
a little scrap of ordinariness

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:44.799
for you to impress, to
dazzle with your cleverness.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.999
You'll find another.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.799
- Please, for God's sake, just stop it.
- Why?

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.839
Because, on balance, even your
Lady Bracknell was more convincing.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.839
Ignore everything he just
said, he's being kind.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:58.160
He's trying to make it
easy for me to kill him.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.760
Which is why this is
going to be so much harder.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:07.119
You said you liked my Lady Bracknell.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.759
Sherlock, don't.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.079
It's not your decision, Dr Watson.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.439
Not in the face, though, please.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.239
I promised my brain
to the Royal Society.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.719
Where would you suggest?

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.719
Well, I suppose there is a
heart somewhere inside me.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.559
I don't imagine it's much of a target,

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:26.839
but why don't we try for that?

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.280
I won't allow this.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.799
This is my fault. Moriarty.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.839
- Moriarty?
- Her Christmas treat.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:40.159
Five minutes' conversation with
Jim Moriarty five years ago.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.559
What did they discuss?

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.600
Five minutes' conversation...

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.400
...unsupervised.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.689
Goodbye, brother mine.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.580
No flowers.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.960
My request.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.013
Jim Moriarty thought you'd make
this choice. He was so excited.

01:08:18.662 --> 01:08:22.359
'And here we are, the end of the line.

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:25.720
'Holmes killing Holmes.'

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.520
'This is where I get off.'

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.359
Five minutes.

01:08:39.834 --> 01:08:44.109
It took her just five minutes
to do all of this to us.

01:08:51.796 --> 01:08:53.719
Well, not on my watch.

01:08:53.743 --> 01:08:55.384
What are you doing?

01:08:56.350 --> 01:08:59.198
A moment ago, a brave man
asked to be remembered.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.759
I'm remembering the governor.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:04.559
- Ten...
- No! No, Sherlock...

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.719
- ...nine, eight...
- You can't!

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.845
- ...seven...
- You don't

01:09:08.871 --> 01:09:10.238
know about Redbeard yet!

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.439
- ...six... five...
- Sherlock!

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:15.038
Sherlock, stop that at once!

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.680
...four...

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.160
...three...

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:22.359
...two...

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.840
'Hello?

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.839
'Hello? Are you still there?'

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:48.118
Yes, yeah, no, I'm...
I'm still here. I'm here.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.279
You went away. You said you'd
help me and you went away.

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:53.238
Yes, I know. Well, I'm sorry about that.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.400
We... we... we must
have got cut off. Um...

01:09:57.737 --> 01:10:00.136
How... how... how long was I away?

01:10:00.161 --> 01:10:01.680
Hours. Hours and hours.

01:10:01.705 --> 01:10:03.639
Why don't grown-ups tell the truth?

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:07.399
No, I-I am telling the
truth. You can trust me.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.239
'Where did you go?'

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.519
I'm not completely sure.

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.079
Um... now, I tell you what,

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.919
you... you've got to be
really, really brave for me.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:20.759
Can you go to the front of
the plane? Can you do that?

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.879
- 'The front?'
- Yes, that's right, the front.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.079
- 'You mean where the driver is?'
- Yes, that's it.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.640
OK. I'm going.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.319
- Are you there yet?
- Yeah, I'm here.

01:10:34.344 --> 01:10:36.005
- John?
- Yeah?

01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:37.039
Where are you?

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.519
I don't know. I've just
woken up. Where are you?

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.359
I'm in another cell. I just spoke
to the girl on the plane again.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.519
- We've been out for hours.
- What, she's still up there?

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:47.359
Yes. The plane will keep flying
until it runs out of fuel.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.136
Is Mycroft with you?

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.839
I have no idea, I can
hardly see anything.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.800
Mycroft? Mycroft?

01:10:52.922 --> 01:10:55.439
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.959
Keep exploring. Tell me anything
you can about where you are.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:00.799
The walls are... rough.
They're rock, I guess.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.008
What are you standing on?

01:11:02.033 --> 01:11:06.492
Er... stone, I think, but, listen,
there's about two feet of water.

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.079
Chains.

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:14.559
Yeah, my feet are chained
up. I can feel something.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.000
Ah.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.919
Bones, Sherlock. There
are bones in here.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.520
What kind of bones?

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.200
Er... I don't know. Small.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:36.639
- Redbeard.
- 'Who's Redbeard?'

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.439
Oh, hello. Are you at the
front of the plane now?

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.959
Yeah. I still can't wake the driver up.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.239
That's all right. What can you see now?

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.879
I can see a river.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:48.359
- There's... there's... there's
a big wheel. - All right.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.079
Well, you and I are going to
have to drive this plane together.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.599
Just you and me.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:55.319
- We are?
- Yeah. There's nothing to it.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.199
We just need to get in touch
with some people on the ground.

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:01.719
Now, um... can you see anything
that looks like a radio?

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.479
No.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.319
That's all right, but keep
looking, we've got plenty of time.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.799
- What's wrong?
- The whole plane's shaking.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.359
It's just turbulence, it's
nothing to worry about.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.039
My ears hurt.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.959
Does the river look
like it's getting closer?

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.159
A little bit.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.759
All right, then, that
means you're nearly home.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.666
Sherlock? I'm in a well.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:29.869
That's where I am. I'm
in the bottom of a well.

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.479
Why would there be a
well in Sherrinford?

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.000
Why is there a draft?

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.519
Walls don't contract
after you've painted them.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.000
Not real ones.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:52.959
I'm home. Musgrave Hall.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.999
'Me and Jim Moriarty,
we got on like a house on fire.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.679
'Which reminded me of home.'

01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.411
Yeah, it's just an old
building, I don't care.

01:12:59.435 --> 01:13:00.919
The plane, tell me about the plane now!

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.959
'Sweet Jim, he was never very
interested in being alive,

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.359
'especially if you could
make more trouble being dead.'

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.999
Yeah, still not interested. The plane!

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.479
'You knew he'd take his revenge.

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.199
'His revenge, apparently, is me.'

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.679
Eurus, let me speak to the little girl on
the plane and I'll play any game you like.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:19.359
'First, find Redbeard.'

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.519
I'm letting the water in now.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.519
You don't want me to drown
another one of your pets, do you?

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:30.039
At long last, Sherlock Holmes, it's
time to solve the Musgrave ritual.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:34.319
Your very first case,
and the final problem.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.839
Oh! Bye-bye.

all those years ago and I found
nothing. I couldn't find anything!

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.159
There was a beech tree
in the grounds and I dug.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.999
I dug, I dug and dug and dug.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.559

Sherlock?

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.199
It was a clever little
puzzle, wasn't it?

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:50.080
So, why couldn't you
work it out, Sherlock?

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.039
Sherlock, there's
something you need to know.

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.599
Emotional context.

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:58.799
And here it comes.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:02.959
Sherlock, the bones I found...

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:05.839
Yes. They're dogs'
bones, that's Redbeard.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.759
Mycroft's been lying
to you, to both of us.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.319
They're not dogs' bones.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:15.119
Remember Daddy's allergy?
What was he allergic to?

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.679
What would he never let you
have, all those times you begged?

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.319
Well, he'd never let you have a dog.

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.759
Come on, Redbeard.

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.160
Your funny little memory, Sherlock.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:38.360
You were upset, so you told
yourself a better story.

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.560
But we never had a dog.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.959

We played pirates.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.200
I was Yellowbeard and he was...

01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:20.389
...he was Redbeard!

01:16:20.414 --> 01:16:23.976

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.240
I never had a best friend.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.480
I had no-one.

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.480
Play with me, Sherlock. Play with me.

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.040
No-one.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.600
No-one.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:13.120
OK. OK, let's play.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:26.799
'Hello? Are you there?'

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.519
I need your help. I'm
trying to solve a puzzle.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:32.319
- 'But what about the plane?!'
- The puzzle will save the plane.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.999
The wrong dates. She used the
wrong dates on the gravestones

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.439
as the key to the cipher,
and the cipher was the song.

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:40.879
Is this strictly relevant?!

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:43.240
Yes, it is. I'll be
with you in a minute.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.559
The lights are getting closer!

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:54.879
Hush now, working.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.640
Let's number the words of the song.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.959
Then rearrange the numbered words

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.640
to match the sequence
on the gravestones.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.959
I am lost.

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.119
Help me brother.

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.199
Save my life

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.359
before my doom.

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.079
I am lost

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:21.399
without your love.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.280
Save my soul, seek my room.

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.880
Oh, God!

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:36.519
We're going to crash!
I'm going to die! Argh!

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.159
I think it's time you
told me your real name.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:45.400
I'm not allowed to tell
my name to strangers.

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.880
But I'm not a stranger, am I?

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.040
I'm your brother.

01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.760
I'm here, Eurus.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.759
You're playing with me, Sherlock.

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.559
We're playing the game.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.679
The game, yes, I get it now.

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:18.039
The song was never a set of directions.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.719
I'm in the plane. I'm going to crash.

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.039
And you're going to save me.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.479
Look how brilliant you are.

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:27.799
Your mind has created
the perfect metaphor.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.919
You're high above us,
all alone in the sky,

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.879
and you understand
everything except how to land.

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:35.920
Now, I'm just an idiot,
but I'm on the ground.

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.159
I can bring you home.

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.239
No.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.479
No, no. It's too late now.

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:44.879
No, it's not, it's not too late.

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:49.719
Every time I close my
eyes, I'm on the plane.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.359
I'm lost, lost in the sky

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:56.160
and... no-one can hear me.

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.360
Open your eyes.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.920
I'm here.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.399
You're not lost anymore.

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:19.839
Now, you... you just, you just went
the wrong way last time, that's all.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:22.079
This time, get it right.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.159
Tell me how to save my friend.

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:25.799
Argh!

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:29.280
Eurus, help me save John Watson.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:45.439
I just spoke to your brother.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.039
How is he? He's a bit
shaken up, that's all.

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:51.279
She didn't hurt him, she just
locked him in her old cell.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:54.439
What goes around comes around.
Give me a moment, boys.

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:57.799
Um... Mycroft, make
sure he's looked after.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.039
He's not as strong as he thinks he is.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.360
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.
- Thanks, Greg.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.959
- The helicopter ready?
- Mm-hm.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.759
Let's move her, then.

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.479
Is that him, sir, Sherlock Holmes?

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.719
Fan, are you?

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:15.039
Well, he's a great man, sir.

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.680
No, he's better than that.

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:19.920
He's a good one.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.481
- You OK?
- I said I'd bring her home.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:29.199
I can't, can I?

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:33.281
Well, you gave her what she
was looking for, context.

01:22:33.306 --> 01:22:34.586
Is that good?

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.080
It's not good, it's not bad, it's...

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:40.640
It is what it is.

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:45.015
Alive for all these years?!

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.239
How is that even possible?!

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.919
What Uncle Rudi began, I
thought it best to continue.

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:57.999
I'm not asking how you did it,
idiot boy, I'm asking how could you?!

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.679
- I was trying to be kind.
- Kind?!

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.399
Kind?!

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:06.719
You told us that our daughter was dead!

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:09.919
Better that than tell
you what she had become.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:11.959
I'm sorry.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:16.559
Whatever she became,
whatever she is now, Mycroft,

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:19.039
she remains our daughter.

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.639
And my sister.

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.359
Then you should have done better.

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.359
He did his best.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:26.720
Then he's very limited.

01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:29.759
Where is she?

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:33.319
Back in Sherrinford. Secure this time.

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.079
People have died.

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:39.239
Without doubt, she will kill
again if she has the opportunity.

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.359
There's no possibility
she'll ever be able to leave.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:43.880
When can we see her?

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:47.399
There's no point.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:49.839
How dare you say that?!

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:51.599
She won't talk.

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.039
She won't communicate
with anyone in any way.

01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:57.559
She has passed beyond our view.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:00.320
There are no words
that can reach her now.

01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.080
Sherlock?

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:09.159
Well? You were always the grown-up.

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:11.440
What do we do now?

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:00.920
Er... yeah, I-I think
you'd better get round here.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:27.719
PS, I know you two.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:31.159
And if I'm gone, I know
what you could become.

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.919
Because I know who you really are.

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.159
A junky who solves crimes to get high.

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:41.331
And the doctor who never
came home from the war.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:50.879
Will you listen to me? Who you
really are, it doesn't matter.

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:53.279
It's all about the legend.

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:56.669
The stories, the adventures.

01:27:05.695 --> 01:27:08.359
There is a last refuge
for the desperate,

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:11.799
the unloved, the persecuted.

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:15.720
There is a final court
of appeal for everyone.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.759
When life gets too strange,

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:45.719
too impossible, too frightening,

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:48.640
there is always one last hope.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.199
When all else fails,
there are two men sitting

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.839
arguing in a scruffy flat

01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.097
like they've always been
there, and they always will.

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:04.769
The best and wisest
men I have ever known.

01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:10.269
My Baker Street boys.

01:28:11.357 --> 01:28:14.557
Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.
