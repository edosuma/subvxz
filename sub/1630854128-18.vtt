WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:05.657
<i>Told him
I needed dialysis.</i>

00:05.657 --> 00:06.919
Left it pretty vague.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.182
It's a good thing
you told him, though.

00:08.182 --> 00:10.793
Not just for his sake.

00:10.793 --> 00:13.013
Hey, Grace.
Over here.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.492
<i>Word is she's single.</i>

00:14.492 --> 00:16.494
Maybe I could buy you
a cup of coffee.

00:16.494 --> 00:19.671
What about a drink instead?

00:19.671 --> 00:21.369
<i>We can help
a lot more people</i>

00:21.369 --> 00:23.849
with Jack's vision
and money in our corner.

00:23.849 --> 00:27.157
Dayton says from now on, 2.0
is for paying customers only.

00:27.157 --> 00:30.421
When Jack wants something, he
can be like a dog after a bone.

00:30.421 --> 00:34.556
Yeah, well, that has
been my impression as well.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.341
Ooh.

00:37.341 --> 00:38.777
Who are the flowers from?

00:45.436 --> 00:47.612
Guess.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.614
Oh,
your not-so-secret admirer,

00:49.614 --> 00:51.790
Dr. George Thomas.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.531
Oh, orchids.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.098
The man's refined.
- No.

00:55.098 --> 00:57.405
The man is persistent.

00:57.405 --> 01:00.321
Come on.

01:00.321 --> 01:01.539
Tell me you're not
a little bit flattered.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.846
Well, it's a bit much,
don't you think?

01:03.846 --> 01:05.108
I think George has a crush.

01:05.108 --> 01:07.241
Well, I think
he needs to take a hint.

01:07.241 --> 01:10.157
He's asked me out
for drinks again.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.984
Why won't you go?

01:11.984 --> 01:13.943
He's on the board, Maggie.

01:13.943 --> 01:16.119
You work here every day.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.381
Where else you supposed
to meet somebody?

01:17.381 --> 01:19.818
Well, I just think
it's not a good idea

01:19.818 --> 01:22.995
to mix business with pleasure.
- Fine.

01:22.995 --> 01:26.173
Sure, but when has that
ever worked for anyone?

01:26.173 --> 01:27.913
I mean, take the ED,
for example.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.915
You've got Ethan and April.

01:29.915 --> 01:31.830
You've got Will and Natalie.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.441
You've got Will and Hannah.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.747
You got Will and--
- Okay, all right.

01:35.747 --> 01:39.142
Spare me the update
on Dr. Halstead's love life.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.404
- There could be...
- Go to work.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.363
- Goodwin and--
- Bye.

01:47.281 --> 01:48.195
I'm surprised
you've got the guts

01:48.195 --> 01:49.152
to show your face this morning,

01:49.152 --> 01:51.023
305 to 146.

01:51.023 --> 01:53.461
Glad to see last night's win
didn't go to your head.

01:53.461 --> 01:54.853
Did you memorize
our Scrabble scores?

01:54.853 --> 01:56.594
Do you think
it's some kind of record?

01:56.594 --> 01:59.249
Largest spread ever recorded.

01:59.249 --> 02:01.730
Well, someone's extra snarky
this morning.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.253
What's in that thermos?
- Oh.

02:03.253 --> 02:05.168
Well, there were
four shots of espresso.

02:05.168 --> 02:07.431
It's empty now.
- Whoa. Where's the fire?

02:07.431 --> 02:09.781
My pilot program
launches today.

02:09.781 --> 02:12.567
That's right. I totally
forgot about the big day.

02:12.567 --> 02:15.439
The ED gets
a technological facelift.

02:15.439 --> 02:18.094
New software,
diagnostic tools,

02:18.094 --> 02:20.270
system upgrades.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.318
Be honest. People are not gonna
like all the changes, right?

02:24.318 --> 02:26.276
- They'll be resistant.
- Of course they will be.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.713
At first, but once
they give it a shot...

02:28.713 --> 02:30.802
They're gonna see the tech is
gonna help them with their work

02:30.802 --> 02:32.804
and work better and work
for them and not against them.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.590
And you can tell I've had
four shots of espresso

02:35.590 --> 02:37.200
on an empty stomach.
- Yes.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.289
Let's get you a muffin.
- Yes, let's.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.291
A blueberry muffin,
chai latte.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.901
Okay.
Yeah, sure.

02:42.901 --> 02:44.468
- Grace?
- Mm-hmm.

02:44.468 --> 02:46.862
- Grace.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm, yeah.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.128
Thanks.
Come here.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.609
Hey, look.

02:54.609 --> 02:57.046
You've been helping me do my
job better since you got here.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.266
Today's gonna go great.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.442
Thank you.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.752
I...

03:07.752 --> 03:09.319
couldn't help it.

03:09.319 --> 03:11.495
No need to help it.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.064
- That was a close one.
- Thank you so much.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.283
I appreciate it.
- Have a good day.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.459
Lifesaver.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.591
Hey, got your own
personal valet now, hotshot?

03:20.591 --> 03:21.984
Your son is a lifesaver.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.855
Apparently, my car
was about to be towed,

03:23.855 --> 03:25.205
and he offered
to move it for me.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.858
That's the least he could do.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.077
What do you mean?

03:28.077 --> 03:29.165
You've take him
under your wing.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.514
You set him up with a sponsor.

03:30.514 --> 03:33.517
You sent that valet gig
his way.

03:33.517 --> 03:34.910
You've been
a really positive influence.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.042
And now
that I've laid it on thick,

03:37.042 --> 03:38.305
can I ask a favor?

03:38.305 --> 03:40.524
Should've seen that coming.

03:40.524 --> 03:41.873
I need an attending

03:41.873 --> 03:44.702
to cover for me next week
at a department meeting,

03:44.702 --> 03:47.096
and you're the only one
around here I trust.

03:47.096 --> 03:48.445
What's going on?

03:48.445 --> 03:51.970
So I'm being evaluated
for the transplant list.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.407
Dr. Cameron feels it's time

03:53.407 --> 03:58.455
seeing as I'm officially
in end stage renal disease.

04:01.415 --> 04:02.981
Dean, I'm sorry.

04:02.981 --> 04:05.462
And the kicker is,
even if I get on the list,

04:05.462 --> 04:07.116
it might not be an easy match.

04:07.116 --> 04:10.728
I've got this high cPRA.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.687
What about Sean?
Isn't he getting tested?

04:12.687 --> 04:15.864
Mm, no,
that's not an option.

04:15.864 --> 04:17.561
But he would be
your best possible donor match.

04:17.561 --> 04:19.215
Yeah, Sean needs to focus

04:19.215 --> 04:20.912
on his own health now,
not mine.

04:20.912 --> 04:23.001
Sean's coming up
on one year of being sober.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.525
He's in a really good place.

04:24.525 --> 04:27.397
Donating could be a really
positive experience for him.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.269
I'm not taking
my son's kidney, Hannah.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.922
- Dean--
- Incoming!

04:30.922 --> 04:32.750
Dr. Archer, you're with me.
- Yeah.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.839
I'm right there.
- It's your son.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.319
He should be given
the opportunity to help

04:36.319 --> 04:37.451
if he wants to.

04:37.451 --> 04:38.756
I don't mean
to be patronizing,

04:38.756 --> 04:43.631
but you'll get it
when you have a kid.

04:45.502 --> 04:47.330
Going to T3.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.332
Kurt Leger.
36-year-old male.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.725
Was ejected
from his wheelchair.

04:50.725 --> 04:52.901
Fell down a flight of stairs.
Vitals are stable.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.642
My wheel got caught
in an uneven tile.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.774
And I went flying.
I'm okay, though, really.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.646
Just knocked the wind out
of me.

04:58.646 --> 04:59.951
How long you been
in a wheelchair?

04:59.951 --> 05:01.257
- Huh?
- How long

05:01.257 --> 05:02.563
have you been
in a wheelchair?

05:02.563 --> 05:04.652
Told us he's got
a T-10 spinal cord injury.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.131
Got bucked off a horse
in high school.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.524
Is this
a complete injury, Kurt,

05:07.524 --> 05:09.439
or is this paralysis
from the waist down?

05:09.439 --> 05:10.788
- Waist down, yeah.
- Okay.

05:10.788 --> 05:14.401
On my count.
One, two, three.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.359
Oh, God.
- Okay.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.496
Okay.

05:24.628 --> 05:27.805
Okay, breath sounds clear bilaterally.

05:27.805 --> 05:29.981
Okay.
Let's take this board out.

05:29.981 --> 05:32.419
Kurt, we're gonna roll you
over for just a moment, okay?

05:32.419 --> 05:34.464
Okay.

05:34.464 --> 05:35.813
All right.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.997
All right, let's hold off
on clearing C-spine just yet.

05:45.997 --> 05:48.522
Give him 100 of fentanyl.
That'll help take the edge off.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.828
Okay.
And we'll be back shortly.

05:52.917 --> 05:55.355
You were pressing
way below T-10.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.660
How could he feel that?

05:56.660 --> 05:58.967
Well, no clue.
Could be referred pain.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.664
We'll know more
once we see imaging.

06:00.664 --> 06:03.885
Has trauma ever reversed
permanent paralysis?

06:03.885 --> 06:06.191
What, from a complete
spinal cord injury? No.

06:06.191 --> 06:07.236
No, never. No.

06:21.598 --> 06:22.904
Hello.

06:22.904 --> 06:23.992
Good morning.
- Oh.

06:23.992 --> 06:25.428
Hey there.
- Hi.

06:25.428 --> 06:27.430
Please sit.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.214
Sit.
- Okay.

06:29.214 --> 06:31.913
I have news.
Big news.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.915
Oh, how exciting.

06:33.915 --> 06:36.047
My coworker, Vanna...

06:36.047 --> 06:37.745
She's moving to Florida
to live with her daughter.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.007
Yeah, you remember.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.225
- Yeah.
- Good.

06:40.225 --> 06:43.707
Well, I might buy her house.

06:43.707 --> 06:45.927
Wow.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.798
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:47.798 --> 06:50.584
It is small,
but it's just me.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.412
So it will be perfect.

06:54.065 --> 06:56.851
- And, I mean, that's great.
- Yeah.

06:56.851 --> 06:59.288
And you can afford it,
I mean, obviously.

06:59.288 --> 07:02.683
Well, I will have to use
all of my savings

07:02.683 --> 07:04.119
for the downpayment

07:04.119 --> 07:07.122
and take out a mortgage,
but I can do it.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.690
And Vanna is offering it to me
off market

07:09.690 --> 07:11.561
for a very fair price.

07:11.561 --> 07:12.997
Well, that's so exciting.

07:12.997 --> 07:14.564
You know it's a fair price because

07:14.564 --> 07:16.958
you looked at some comps
in the neighborhood?

07:16.958 --> 07:18.916
- Comps?
- Comparable properties.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.918
Comps, yes.
Well, no.

07:20.918 --> 07:23.660
I haven't yet, but I will.
- No, not yet.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.184
Yeah.
- And I trust Vanna.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.492
Yeah.

07:29.492 --> 07:32.321
You don't think
this is a good idea.

07:32.321 --> 07:34.541
Oh, gosh, I don't mean
to give that impression at all.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.759
I don't.
- Oh, okay.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.587
I just think, you know,
you have to be...

07:37.587 --> 07:40.503
I don't know, always when you
make a big move like this,

07:40.503 --> 07:42.374
you gotta ask the question,
is now the best time to buy?

07:42.374 --> 07:44.986
You know, and if you're
gonna wipe out your savings

07:44.986 --> 07:46.335
for the downpayment,
I mean,

07:46.335 --> 07:47.771
maintenance issues
will come along.

07:47.771 --> 07:48.816
You might want to do
a renovation.

07:48.816 --> 07:49.817
You just gotta make sure...

07:49.817 --> 07:51.383
Hey, look, I really--

07:51.383 --> 07:53.037
I don't mean to be a downer
about this at all.

07:53.037 --> 07:54.735
I really don't.
- No, it's okay.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.867
There's a lot to think about.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.739
I'm still thinking about it.
- Okay.

07:58.739 --> 08:01.306
You want to go somewhere
and talk about it some more?

08:01.306 --> 08:02.786
Get a cup of coffee
or something?

08:02.786 --> 08:04.919
I can't.
I have errands to run.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.747
And I will see you later, Daniel.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.662
Okay.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.925
Hey, congrats.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.883
Congrats.

08:14.668 --> 08:17.758
The new system automatically
updates room availability

08:17.758 --> 08:19.716
and displays room assignments
on all the monitors.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.196
Maggie, now you won't
have someone asking you

08:21.196 --> 08:22.502
every two minutes,
"Where am I going?"

08:22.502 --> 08:24.460
No, that'll still happen.
Okay, everybody.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.027
Let's get back to work.
Thank you very much.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.289
No, no, it won't happen
because now

08:27.289 --> 08:28.595
they can just look
at the monitors--

08:28.595 --> 08:30.988
I understand that they can,
but will they?

08:30.988 --> 08:33.034
These folks are
creatures of habit.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.950
Well, it'll become habit
over time.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.256
Okay, well tell me more
about these lights.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.955
Are they part
of a room triage system?

08:40.955 --> 08:43.653
So no, these are
actually noise sensors.

08:43.653 --> 08:47.091
They monitor volume levels
throughout the ED.

08:47.091 --> 08:48.615
When it gets too loud,
they start flashing.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.878
What happens when they do?

08:50.878 --> 08:52.880
Noise police just pops out? Oh.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.403
Well, no.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.231
Hopefully
it's a gentle reminder

08:56.231 --> 08:58.929
to anyone in the vicinity
to lower their voice.

08:58.929 --> 09:00.409
- Yeah, I'm--
- Research shows

09:00.409 --> 09:03.020
that excessive noise
in the emergency room

09:03.020 --> 09:04.369
increases patients'
stress and anxiety,

09:04.369 --> 09:06.241
raises their cortisol levels.

09:06.241 --> 09:08.635
Well, I'm for the reminder
to the staff

09:08.635 --> 09:12.116
that they must keep unnecessary
noise at a minimum.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.422
I mean,
it's what I do every day.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.076
Which you shouldn't have to.

09:15.076 --> 09:17.121
You got enough
on your plate, Maggie.

09:17.121 --> 09:18.514
Adults should be able
to self-monitor

09:18.514 --> 09:21.169
with a simple visual cue, right?

09:21.169 --> 09:24.085
I guess, Grace.
We'll see.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.917
- Hello, Ms. Palmer.
- It's Alicia.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.615
Hi, Alicia.
I'm Dr. Halstead.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.617
I see you've been experiencing
frequent headaches lately.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.619
Yeah, two to three a week
for the last month.

09:36.619 --> 09:39.100
The one I'm currently having
is the longest so far.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.885
Going on 29 hours.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.060
This should all be in my chart.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.627
I gave the nurse
a record of my attacks.

09:44.627 --> 09:45.802
Yes, I'm seeing that here.

09:45.802 --> 09:48.239
And a list
of conditions and diseases

09:48.239 --> 09:50.067
that include my symptoms.

09:50.067 --> 09:51.329
I'm obviously not a doctor.

09:51.329 --> 09:53.114
I'm not trying
to insult your intelligence.

09:53.114 --> 09:54.637
No offense taken.

09:54.637 --> 09:56.421
I just read
that people get misdiagnosed

09:56.421 --> 09:58.380
in the emergency room
every year.

09:58.380 --> 10:01.209
Well, I can tell you
a misdiagnosis tends to happen

10:01.209 --> 10:03.472
when a patient's presentation
is atypical.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.561
Yes, that is
what the article said.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.911
But here at Med,
we've actually got a new--

10:07.911 --> 10:09.957
well, really new,
like, as of today--

10:09.957 --> 10:11.349
AI-based diagnostic tool

10:11.349 --> 10:13.177
that helps us make sure
we don't miss anything.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.962
There's a lot more to it,
but the gist is

10:14.962 --> 10:16.311
it creates a differential

10:16.311 --> 10:17.660
for the doctor to compare
against their own.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.357
Differential.
That's the list of things

10:19.357 --> 10:21.011
that could be wrong with me, right?

10:21.011 --> 10:25.146
So it's like having a colleague
double-check your work.

10:25.146 --> 10:27.235
A colleague that scans

10:27.235 --> 10:29.498
every medical database
and journal in an instant.

10:29.498 --> 10:32.501
Okay, yeah.
Let's definitely use the robot.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.503
Well, because we're
in the pilot phase still,

10:34.503 --> 10:35.896
I'm gonna need you
to sign a consent form.

10:35.896 --> 10:36.984
I'll grab it and be right back.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.594
- Thanks.
- All right.

10:40.422 --> 10:41.902
I'm sorry
I didn't put on the gown.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.512
I know I'm supposed to,

10:43.512 --> 10:46.994
but it would take me forever
at the moment.

10:46.994 --> 10:48.691
I'll cut you some slack.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.258
I'm also kind of hoping
this won't take long.

10:50.258 --> 10:53.391
Ryan has had perfect attendance
all year.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.698
Oh, well as an alumna
of the perfect attendance club,

10:55.698 --> 10:58.701
I will do my best
to get you both out the door.

10:58.701 --> 11:01.922
So, Sarah, you got dizzy
driving to school today?

11:01.922 --> 11:02.966
For, like, a few seconds.

11:02.966 --> 11:04.315
Yeah, I pulled over

11:04.315 --> 11:05.839
to study myself for a moment.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.188
And then I felt fine.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.538
But my worrywart over here

11:09.538 --> 11:11.845
begged me to turn around
and come here.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.150
She gets dizzy a lot.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.065
Sometimes she has trouble
catching her breath.

11:15.065 --> 11:16.937
- Hmm.
- I have to park on the street.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.721
I get a little winded sometimes

11:18.721 --> 11:20.854
walking from our apartment
to the car.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.290
Every day?

11:22.290 --> 11:25.206
I tried to explain to Ryan
it's normal.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.990
Well,
your ankles are swollen.

11:26.990 --> 11:30.733
And your breathing still seems
a bit labored, even at rest.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.082
Yeah, I had swollen ankles

11:32.082 --> 11:33.693
and I was panting all the time

11:33.693 --> 11:35.129
when I was this big
with Ryan too.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.347
Just ask my ex.

11:36.347 --> 11:38.915
Oh, wait.
He's nowhere to be found.

11:38.915 --> 11:40.700
Well, these all
could be symptoms

11:40.700 --> 11:42.745
of third trimester pregnancy,
I agree,

11:42.745 --> 11:44.878
but I'd still like to do
a full workup just to be safe.

11:44.878 --> 11:47.358
I've got an appointment
with by OB on Monday.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.447
I'd really prefer if we
could just check you out now.

11:49.447 --> 11:52.494
Mom, look at this text
you got from Ms. Goto.

11:52.494 --> 11:55.236
It says as long as I get back
before lunch is over,

11:55.236 --> 11:56.890
it won't mess up my record.

11:56.890 --> 12:00.763
So let the doctor
run tests and stuff, please.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.113
Okay, okay.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.289
Yes,
run all the tests and stuff.

12:05.289 --> 12:08.075
Hey, I'm just fine.

12:08.075 --> 12:12.209
We'll make sure your baby
sister is feeling good, okay?

12:12.209 --> 12:14.777
Dr. Archer,
Kurt Leger's scans are up.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.562
Okay.

12:17.562 --> 12:22.089
Yeah, unstable burst fracture
at T-12 from the fall today.

12:22.089 --> 12:24.439
What?

12:24.439 --> 12:26.528
Well, it isn't
a medical miracle

12:26.528 --> 12:28.225
he's got feeling below T-10.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.445
What do you mean?

12:30.445 --> 12:34.275
Well, no evidence of
prior trauma at the vertebrae.

12:38.105 --> 12:42.065
Yeah, this guy's not paralyzed.

12:42.065 --> 12:44.198
Kurt.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.330
Wanted to review your imaging.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.512
To start with,

12:54.512 --> 12:56.514
you don't have an injury
at T-10.

12:57.864 --> 13:01.519
I'm guessing
this isn't news to you.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.695
Do I need to repeat that?

13:03.695 --> 13:05.045
I didn't think
the scans would--

13:05.045 --> 13:07.482
What, blow your cover?

13:07.482 --> 13:09.658
Okay,
but what's really pressing--

13:09.658 --> 13:11.007
I'm not trying
to get disability benefits

13:11.007 --> 13:12.139
or better parking.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.488
That's not why.
- Sure, sure.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.316
Of course, yeah.
- I don't want you to think--

13:15.316 --> 13:17.753
Hey, it really doesn't matter
what I think.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.581
What does matter:
your tumble today

13:19.581 --> 13:21.975
caused
an unstable burst fracture

13:21.975 --> 13:23.759
in your T-12 vertebrae,

13:23.759 --> 13:27.067
and that's gonna
require surgery to fix.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.372
And without surgery?

13:28.372 --> 13:30.897
There really
is not another option.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.507
If your fracture was stable,

13:32.507 --> 13:34.204
I would say
you can try a brace.

13:34.204 --> 13:37.860
No, no, I'm not asking
about other options.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.515
If I don't treat this,
what will happen?

13:40.515 --> 13:43.648
You're gonna end up
actually needing a wheelchair.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.781
You're gonna be looking
at weeks in bed.

13:45.781 --> 13:46.913
Chronic back pain.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.002
Weakness in one
or both of your legs.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.308
Numbness.

13:51.308 --> 13:53.789
Even paralysis.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.882
I don't want the surgery.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.586
So I really appreciate
you giving me access

14:08.586 --> 14:09.587
to your psychiatric records.

14:09.587 --> 14:10.980
It's very helpful.
- Of course.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.112
How about I just,
you know, give you

14:12.112 --> 14:13.417
my understanding
of what I read,

14:13.417 --> 14:15.898
and then you let me know
if I missed anything.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.334
Does that sound okay?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.468
All right,
so you were diagnosed

14:20.468 --> 14:24.254
with body integrity identity
disorder eight years ago

14:24.254 --> 14:27.910
but experienced symptoms
from early childhood.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.869
Since I was
at least five, yeah.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.610
And for you,
BIID presents itself

14:32.610 --> 14:36.745
in the form of a very strong
desire to be paralyzed?

14:36.745 --> 14:39.095
It's all I think about.

14:39.095 --> 14:42.403
It dominates
every aspect of my life.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.405
But it seems like

14:44.405 --> 14:47.190
a wheelchair
gave you some relief.

14:47.190 --> 14:50.890
Some, but I can
still feel my legs.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.326
And for reasons
I can't explain,

14:52.326 --> 14:54.545
that's an extremely
distressing feeling.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.113
I've had therapists
tell me it's due

14:57.113 --> 14:58.767
to repressed childhood trauma,

14:58.767 --> 15:02.336
neurologists who think it's
a glitch in my cerebral cortex.

15:02.336 --> 15:05.687
A psychic told me
it was linked to a past life.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.471
Right.

15:07.471 --> 15:08.951
Yeah, I mean,
I can see that you've tried

15:08.951 --> 15:10.997
a number of different
therapeutic approaches here--

15:10.997 --> 15:13.956
you know,
kind of behavioral therapy,

15:13.956 --> 15:16.611
antidepressants,
muscle relaxants.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.527
Even hypnosis.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.529
Nothing's worked.

15:21.529 --> 15:24.532
I wish I had something
special in my toolkit for you,

15:24.532 --> 15:27.187
but, I mean, frankly,
these are all the therapies

15:27.187 --> 15:29.972
I would recommend myself.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.844
Must be very frustrating
for you.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.846
Yeah.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.674
And honestly,

15:36.674 --> 15:40.026
today's the most hopeful I've
felt in a really long time.

15:43.812 --> 15:46.684
I want the tests.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.034
Okay.

15:50.862 --> 15:54.605
Hey, Grace, you got a sec?
- Hey.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.999
So I don't know if there's,
like, a formal suggestion box

15:56.999 --> 15:58.218
during this pilot phase.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.742
I'm the suggestion box.
What's up?

16:00.742 --> 16:01.917
New software.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.919
It included
giant cell arteritis

16:03.919 --> 16:05.051
in my patient's differential.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.226
Your patient
with the headaches.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.402
- Exactly.
- GCA's pretty rare.

16:08.402 --> 16:12.449
It presents in 5 out of
every 10,000 people, I think.

16:12.449 --> 16:15.670
And testing for it requires
a number of expensive labs.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.367
The patient's insurance
is gonna cover it,

16:17.367 --> 16:20.153
but I don't like
ordering unnecessary tests.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.285
I prefer to rule out horses
before chasing zebras.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.287
Of course, but you
don't have to order the labs.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.594
A doctor can override any
suggestion on the differential.

16:26.594 --> 16:29.031
Right, but before
the doctor can do that,

16:29.031 --> 16:30.685
the differential's
automatically uploaded

16:30.685 --> 16:31.903
to the patient's chart.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.254
Which the patient can view
in real time

16:34.254 --> 16:35.951
by logging in
to the online portal.

16:35.951 --> 16:37.170
Which my patient did.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.432
And now,
she's insisting

16:38.432 --> 16:40.347
I order
all these unnecessary labs.

16:40.347 --> 16:43.437
So your suggestion is
to lose automatic upload,

16:43.437 --> 16:47.049
which we can't because when the
patient signs the consent form,

16:47.049 --> 16:49.573
they're guaranteed access
to the full results.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.010
Ah, I see.

16:53.403 --> 16:56.624
Well, you know what?
Better safe than sorry.

16:56.624 --> 16:58.104
Right?
- Yeah.

16:58.104 --> 17:01.107
Absolutely, and it'll
ease the patient's mind too.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.673
Well, let me know
how it turns out.

17:07.461 --> 17:10.116
Hello, Baylin.
Remember me, Maggie?

17:10.116 --> 17:11.639
Baylin drove himself
to the ED

17:11.639 --> 17:13.597
because he feels like
his heart is pounding.

17:13.597 --> 17:14.772
I'm sorry to hear that.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.165
You want to take a walk
with me, okay?

17:16.165 --> 17:17.688
We're going right down here
to three.

17:17.688 --> 17:18.950
Thanks, Leah.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.649
The CIA is following me.

17:21.649 --> 17:23.259
I think I saw one of them
in the waiting area.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.434
But I can't be sure.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.914
He's always changing
his appearance.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.655
All right, I won't let anyone
come into your room

17:27.655 --> 17:28.656
without your permission.

17:28.656 --> 17:29.918
Trini here

17:29.918 --> 17:31.528
is gonna help you get situated.

17:31.528 --> 17:32.703
Hi, Baylin.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.009
Why don't you take a seat
on the bed?

17:34.009 --> 17:35.445
I'll grab a gown.

17:37.795 --> 17:39.406
- Trini.
- Yeah?

17:39.406 --> 17:42.278
Baylin's a frequent flier
with schizophrenia

17:42.278 --> 17:44.672
with a complex PTSD,
and psych's backed up.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.195
Got it.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.936
Do you mind keeping him
company for a bit?

17:47.936 --> 17:50.591
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.114
Hi.

17:52.114 --> 17:55.161
Hi, Sarah.
This is Dr. Marcel.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.337
- Hi.
- Hey, Sarah.

17:57.337 --> 18:00.122
Um, I see surgery
on your scrubs, Dr. Marcel,

18:00.122 --> 18:02.342
and it's making me nervous.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.866
Well, I tend to have
that effect on people.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.737
Well, Sarah,
before we go over your results,

18:06.737 --> 18:10.089
we were gonna see if Ryan here
wanted to go to the rec room.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.266
There's all kinds of video
games and snacks down there.

18:13.266 --> 18:14.484
Yeah, that's a great idea.

18:14.484 --> 18:15.833
Why don't you check it out, kiddo?

18:15.833 --> 18:17.531
No, I'm staying with you.

18:17.531 --> 18:20.360
Ryan, this is a conversation
between grown-ups.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.102
I'll be quiet.
I promise.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.713
It's just us two.

18:25.713 --> 18:28.150
There's no keeping anything
from him anyway.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.543
Go ahead.

18:31.284 --> 18:34.461
Okay, so I asked
Dr. Marcel to consult

18:34.461 --> 18:37.246
because your echocardiogram
revealed you have a condition

18:37.246 --> 18:39.466
called
peripartum cardiomyopathy,

18:39.466 --> 18:41.381
or PPCM.

18:41.381 --> 18:44.210
It's often missed,
because as you experienced,

18:44.210 --> 18:46.212
it mimics the symptoms
of pregnancy.

18:46.212 --> 18:49.345
So, Ryan, it's really good that
you brought your mom in today.

18:49.345 --> 18:50.607
Great job, buddy.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.914
That's heart disease,
isn't it?

18:52.914 --> 18:54.829
It is.
Yours is a very rare form

18:54.829 --> 18:57.440
that can occur
at the end of pregnancy

18:57.440 --> 18:59.225
or shortly after giving birth.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.314
Now, I reviewed your echo
with Dr. Asher,

19:01.314 --> 19:03.098
and we can treat you
with medicine.

19:03.098 --> 19:05.187
Oh, thank goodness.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.536
We will have
to admit you overnight.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.234
Wait.
To the hospital?

19:08.234 --> 19:09.539
We'll start you
on medications

19:09.539 --> 19:10.932
to help your heart
function better

19:10.932 --> 19:13.108
and get rid of any fluid
that's causing discomfort.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.240
If I'm just
taking medication,

19:14.240 --> 19:15.850
why can't I do that at home?

19:15.850 --> 19:17.156
Well, it's recommended

19:17.156 --> 19:18.766
that you stay in the hospital
for monitoring

19:18.766 --> 19:20.028
and so you can rest,

19:20.028 --> 19:22.030
at least until
the acute symptoms subside.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.423
I can't.

19:23.423 --> 19:26.991
I don't have anyone
to watch Ryan, and...

19:26.991 --> 19:29.037
I really can't afford
a hospital stay right now.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.866
I'm saving up to send Ryan
to private school next year.

19:31.866 --> 19:34.608
Speaking of, kiddo,
we gotta get you to school.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.697
Lunch period
is gonna be over soon.

19:36.697 --> 19:37.785
Mom, I don't care.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.221
What do you mean
you don't care?

19:39.221 --> 19:40.962
This kid
has perfect attendance.

19:40.962 --> 19:42.268
And if he keeps it up,

19:42.268 --> 19:44.052
he is gonna get an award
at the end of the year.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.533
Stop it, Mom! I don't care
about the stupid award!

19:46.533 --> 19:48.926
Hey, you don't
speak to me like that.

19:49.884 --> 19:52.539
Just get me the prescription
so I can leave.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.367
I really
can't recommend that.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.803
I understand.

19:55.803 --> 19:58.806
Please get me
the prescriptions.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.161
I know we've had
disagreements in the past

20:06.161 --> 20:07.206
around this topic,

20:07.206 --> 20:08.946
but this is a no-brainer.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.600
This guy wants to be paralyzed.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.254
How can he have
decisional capacity?

20:12.254 --> 20:15.039
Well, because like a vast
majority of people with BIID,

20:15.039 --> 20:17.216
he's aware and oriented, right?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.000
He understands
the risks of the surgery

20:19.000 --> 20:20.436
as well as the alternatives.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.264
You know, he's of sound mind.
- Sound mind?

20:22.264 --> 20:25.485
What about the fact that he
flung himself down the stairs?

20:25.485 --> 20:26.877
No evidence
that the fall was intentional.

20:26.877 --> 20:29.750
Come on, man.
How could there not be?

20:29.750 --> 20:31.186
Well,
according to the paramedics,

20:31.186 --> 20:32.318
there were several witnesses

20:32.318 --> 20:33.362
who confirmed
it was an accident.

20:33.362 --> 20:34.798
Not to mention,

20:34.798 --> 20:37.323
no history of self-harm
or reckless behavior.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.499
Actually was able
to get ahold of his shrink

20:39.499 --> 20:41.631
who assured me
he never even considered

20:41.631 --> 20:42.893
trying to paralyze himself.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.504
Well, maybe
he just never discussed it.

20:44.504 --> 20:45.722
- Dean.
- Yeah?

20:45.722 --> 20:47.594
Even if the fall
were intentional,

20:47.594 --> 20:49.291
we still can't force
a surgery on him.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.945
No, but a court order could.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.860
But we don't have the grounds
to petition a judge, right?

20:52.860 --> 20:54.253
Because he competent.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.342
I don't like it either, okay?

20:56.342 --> 20:58.169
But he has the right
to refuse the surgery.

20:58.169 --> 20:59.562
Okay, all right.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.477
And once again,
you're keeping my patients

21:01.477 --> 21:03.262
from getting
the care they need.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.701
Hey, so what gives?

21:07.701 --> 21:09.964
What are you talking about?

21:09.964 --> 21:11.444
You didn't see
this impromptu board meeting

21:11.444 --> 21:13.533
added to your calendar?

21:13.533 --> 21:16.362
I mean, do you have any idea
what this is about?

21:16.362 --> 21:18.842
I didn't even know
it was happening.

21:18.842 --> 21:20.714
Okay, well,
it's an impromptu meeting

21:20.714 --> 21:23.282
with the entire board,
plus C-suite, okay?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.022
I mean, that can't be good.

21:25.022 --> 21:27.634
Look, I don't like
being blindsided either,

21:27.634 --> 21:29.026
but don't get all fatalistic.

21:29.026 --> 21:30.898
Yeah, well,
when I talked to Jack about it,

21:30.898 --> 21:33.944
he wouldn't share any details,
and he told me not to worry.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.119
That makes me worry.

21:35.119 --> 21:37.252
Well, you're
in fairly regular contact

21:37.252 --> 21:38.993
with his lawyers,
aren't you?

21:38.993 --> 21:42.431
Well, see if he has any
significant filings in motion,

21:42.431 --> 21:45.260
and I'll put a call out
to George.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.175
Maybe he has some intel.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.481
George?

21:48.481 --> 21:52.093
Yeah, Dr. Thomas,
our newest board member.

21:52.093 --> 21:53.442
Oh, yeah,
I didn't realize

21:53.442 --> 21:55.357
that you and George
were getting so chummy.

21:58.099 --> 22:01.363
I'll go find some other
business to stick my nose into.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.370
Red light.

22:09.589 --> 22:11.025
Red light!
The CIA's found me!

22:11.025 --> 22:12.766
The signals are moving!

22:12.766 --> 22:14.028
They're gonna be here
any minute.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.421
- Let's get back in bed, okay?
- Oh, no.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.639
They flash the red lights

22:16.639 --> 22:17.684
when they got you cornered
like a rat.

22:17.684 --> 22:18.772
That's their signal to move in!

22:18.772 --> 22:20.077
Maggie, I could use a hand.

22:20.077 --> 22:21.557
- No, no, no, no.
- Baylin.

22:21.557 --> 22:22.732
Baylin,
I need you to calm down.

22:22.732 --> 22:25.082
Breathe. Breathe.
I need you to breathe.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.867
These light,
I'm turning them off right now.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.347
I'm turning them off.
- Yeah, I'm sorry!

22:28.347 --> 22:29.522
I have to go!
- Baylin.

22:29.522 --> 22:30.827
- Baylin. Baylin.
- They're gonna kill me!

22:30.827 --> 22:33.308
Security, stop him
from leaving right now.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.092
Page Dr. Charles.

22:35.092 --> 22:36.833
Let me go!
Let me go!

22:38.269 --> 22:40.707
I gotta go, please.

22:44.580 --> 22:46.843
Looks like
our old buddy, Baylin,

22:46.843 --> 22:48.410
went off his meds
a couple weeks ago.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.586
Good news: he's agreed
to check into the psych ward

22:50.586 --> 22:52.675
for a couple of days
until he gets back on regimen.

22:52.675 --> 22:53.763
Great.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.809
So these are
what set him off?

22:55.809 --> 22:56.984
And why were
they installed again?

22:56.984 --> 22:58.551
To make patients
more comfortable.

22:58.551 --> 23:01.858
The genius of Jack Dayton.
They got to go.

23:01.858 --> 23:03.512
Mm-hmm.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.386
Maggie,
I heard what happened.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.866
So you'll understand
why I want the lights removed.

23:09.866 --> 23:11.520
Red was a poor color choice.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.218
I'll reprogram the lights to
something more neutral tonight.

23:14.218 --> 23:16.395
I want them gone,
please, Grace.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.701
Not reprogrammed.
Just gone.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.964
You agreed that monitoring
noise levels in the ED

23:20.964 --> 23:22.313
is important
for patient care.

23:22.313 --> 23:24.098
And I do
a damn good job of it.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.708
I'm not suggesting
that you're not.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.406
I don't need any assistance.

23:31.148 --> 23:33.977
So good news.
All your labs came back normal.

23:33.977 --> 23:35.675
Your ESR was mildly elevated,

23:35.675 --> 23:37.590
but that's nothing
to be concerned about.

23:37.590 --> 23:39.200
What is ESR?
What does it test for?

23:39.200 --> 23:41.245
Erythrocyte
sedimentation rate.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.465
It measures inflammatory
activity in the body.

23:43.465 --> 23:46.163
- And mine's elevated?
- Mildly.

23:46.163 --> 23:47.861
And it can be elevated
for a number of reasons.

23:47.861 --> 23:50.167
I mean, something like
stubbing your toe will do it.

23:50.167 --> 23:51.908
What if you have--
what is it called--

23:51.908 --> 23:53.997
giant cell...
- Arteritis.

23:53.997 --> 23:56.565
Right. Would your ESR
be elevated then?

23:56.565 --> 23:58.524
Yes,
but much higher than yours.

23:58.524 --> 23:59.612
How much higher?

23:59.612 --> 24:01.396
Off the top of my head,
I believe,

24:01.396 --> 24:02.832
typically 50 or above.

24:02.832 --> 24:04.921
- And mine was 31.
- Correct.

24:04.921 --> 24:09.099
And you never see GCA in
a patient with an ESR below 50?

24:09.099 --> 24:11.232
There have been cases,
similar ones,

24:11.232 --> 24:12.451
but those patients
all had symptoms

24:12.451 --> 24:14.278
of the condition
you do not have.

24:14.278 --> 24:17.412
Uh, it's far more likely
you have a headache disorder.

24:17.412 --> 24:19.283
I suspect migraines
or cluster headaches.

24:19.283 --> 24:20.763
I'd like to refer you
to a specialist--

24:20.763 --> 24:23.200
Whoa, your system says here,
if it is GCA,

24:23.200 --> 24:25.289
it should be treated
right away to prevent...

24:25.289 --> 24:27.466
vision loss
or a stroke?

24:27.466 --> 24:29.772
It could be weeks
before I see a specialist.

24:29.772 --> 24:32.427
Alicia, the gold standard
for diagnosing GCA

24:32.427 --> 24:34.560
is a temporal artery biopsy.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.649
Neurosurgeon makes an incision
above your temple

24:36.649 --> 24:37.954
and removes a piece
of your blood vessel.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.608
A surgeon?

24:39.608 --> 24:41.610
Yes, we're talking
about an actual procedure here.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.003
But I'd be out
for the whole thing.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.352
They put me to sleep, right?

24:44.352 --> 24:46.615
No, it's only used
with light sedation

24:46.615 --> 24:47.529
under local anesthetic.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.009
You'd be awake the whole time.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.142
Look, I know headaches
are extremely frustrating

24:52.142 --> 24:53.448
and you want answers,
but let's start

24:53.448 --> 24:55.058
with giving you some relief.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.147
I'm gonna put you on triptan.
It's a class of drug used--

24:57.147 --> 24:59.019
I'm not gonna feel any relief

24:59.019 --> 25:02.631
until I know definitively
this isn't GCA.

25:02.631 --> 25:04.981
Alicia, it's just you have
so few of the symptoms--

25:04.981 --> 25:06.809
You said misdiagnoses happen

25:06.809 --> 25:09.856
when a patient's presentation
is atypical.

25:09.856 --> 25:13.033
I want the biopsy.

25:15.209 --> 25:17.124
Sarah, I really wish
you'd reconsider staying.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.429
Just let me
get him to school.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.475
If I have another spell,
I'll come right back.

25:20.475 --> 25:21.955
Oh!

25:21.955 --> 25:23.739
Wait.
Did my water just break?

25:23.739 --> 25:25.045
Let me check.

25:26.263 --> 25:28.396
Yes, it did.
Okay, it is time.

25:28.396 --> 25:30.572
- What? But it's so early.
- You're 38 weeks.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.139
Yeah.
Ryan was two weeks late.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.575
Every baby comes
on their own timeline.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.185
Let's get you up
to labor and delivery.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.318
Wait. What about Ryan?
My sister's in Michigan.

25:37.318 --> 25:39.189
It'll take her six hours
to get here.

25:39.189 --> 25:41.670
- Mom, I want to stay with you.
- No, you don't.

25:41.670 --> 25:43.846
A delivery room is no place
for an 11-year-old boy.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.022
You'll be scarred for life.
- If it's okay with Ryan,

25:46.022 --> 25:48.372
I don't mind hanging with him
here at the hospital.

25:48.372 --> 25:49.809
I don't have anywhere to be.

25:49.809 --> 25:51.462
No.
No, I can't ask you to do that.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.769
You didn't.
I offered.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.554
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.947
Hey, you listen
to Dr. Marcel, okay?

25:57.947 --> 26:00.646
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah.

26:01.908 --> 26:03.518
All right, bud.

26:05.738 --> 26:06.869
Bye.

26:06.869 --> 26:09.263
Come on.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.877
Dr. Archer, hi.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.532
I know it's not my place...

26:19.708 --> 26:23.712
But you are giving something up
that you cannot get back.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.366
I understand that.

26:25.366 --> 26:27.194
And if you change your mind
down the road--

26:27.194 --> 26:29.022
I'm not gonna change my mind.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.632
Hmm.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.982
When you lose control of your
bladder for the first time,

26:32.982 --> 26:34.114
you'll feel differently.

26:34.114 --> 26:35.419
Not to be disrespectful,

26:35.419 --> 26:37.247
but I went over all of this
with Dr. Charles,

26:37.247 --> 26:38.771
and he was satisfied.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.903
Because you told him what
you knew he needed to hear.

26:40.903 --> 26:42.339
- Excuse me?
- Oh.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.907
I think you knew exactly
what you were doing today.

26:44.907 --> 26:47.736
Dr. Archer,

26:47.736 --> 26:49.259
can I get a word, please?

26:57.790 --> 27:00.357
You think I don't know when I'm
getting played by a patient?

27:00.357 --> 27:01.750
It wasn't a comment
on your skill.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.360
Dean,
what are you thinking, man?

27:03.360 --> 27:06.494
I need to remind you of all
people that bullying a patient

27:06.494 --> 27:08.539
into a procedure
might get you in real trouble?

27:08.539 --> 27:10.541
Somebody needed
to talk some sense into this...

27:10.541 --> 27:12.282
All right, this is
an unprecedented situation.

27:12.282 --> 27:13.719
- No, it's not.
- It absolutely is.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.590
Maybe some more opinions
in the mix.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.287
Oh, you want to get another
psychiatrist to weigh in?

27:17.287 --> 27:18.985
- I think it'd be wise.
- Great idea.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.464
It would
cover ourselves legally.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.815
Whoa.
You're getting loud, Doctors.

27:22.815 --> 27:23.946
Dr. Kwon's on call.

27:23.946 --> 27:25.644
Say hi for me.

27:31.867 --> 27:33.869
All right, lidocaine and
a gram of cefazolin, please.

27:33.869 --> 27:35.784
Thank you.

27:35.784 --> 27:37.351
What's that for again?

27:37.351 --> 27:40.180
It's an antibiotic to prevent
infection post-procedure.

27:40.180 --> 27:42.704
Scalpel.
All right, Alicia.

27:42.704 --> 27:43.836
You're gonna feel
a little pressure

27:43.836 --> 27:44.967
as I make my incision, okay?

27:44.967 --> 27:46.490
Just breathe.

27:50.190 --> 27:51.713
- How you doing, Alicia?
- Mm.

27:51.713 --> 27:53.628
Feels a little weird,
but I'm okay.

27:55.369 --> 27:57.545
All right.
Not too much longer, Alicia.

27:57.545 --> 27:59.329
Almost to the vessel.

27:59.329 --> 28:01.418
You're doing great.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.464
Yeah, biopsy's nearly complete.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.814
Dr. Halstead, I--

28:05.814 --> 28:07.947
I can't... swallow.

28:09.252 --> 28:11.428
Is this from the anesthesia?

28:11.428 --> 28:13.300
No, it wouldn't
affect your airway.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.562
Maybe you're just
feeling a little nervous.

28:14.562 --> 28:16.216
Take a deep breath.

28:16.216 --> 28:18.827
I can't.
My throat is closing in.

28:18.827 --> 28:21.743
Sats at 86%.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.832
Epi one milligram IV.
125 solumedrol.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.616
I can't... I can't...

28:25.616 --> 28:27.749
Alicia, you're having an
allergic reaction to something.

28:27.749 --> 28:29.533
There were no indications
in her chart, right?

28:29.533 --> 28:31.710
None, and she didn't
mention any allergies.

28:34.538 --> 28:37.019
I need you
to keep that on for me.

28:37.019 --> 28:39.021
Where's that epi?

28:39.021 --> 28:41.545
It's right here.

28:41.545 --> 28:44.287
Okay, Alicia, hang on.
You're gonna be okay.

28:44.287 --> 28:46.246
You're gonna be okay.

28:53.296 --> 28:55.037
- Hey.
- Hey, I got your text.

28:55.037 --> 28:56.082
Sarah's baby is breech?
- Mm?

28:56.082 --> 28:57.779
Just scanned her
a few minutes ago.

28:57.779 --> 29:00.260
If it were up to me, we'd
proceed with a vaginal delivery

29:00.260 --> 29:01.696
and use pipers
to pull the head out.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.350
But let me guess,
Sarah wants to do a C-section

29:03.350 --> 29:04.873
because it's safer
for the baby?

29:04.873 --> 29:06.527
But far riskier for Sarah,
as you know,

29:06.527 --> 29:07.789
given her heart condition.

29:07.789 --> 29:09.312
I hated
to pull you out of the ED,

29:09.312 --> 29:10.792
but I could really use
an extra set of hands in there.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.620
Yeah, of course, I'll
scrub and meet you in the OR.

29:12.620 --> 29:13.839
Great.

29:15.144 --> 29:19.105
I shouldn't have
talked to her like that.

29:19.105 --> 29:21.585
Well, the thing about moms is

29:21.585 --> 29:25.633
they have this funny way of
knowing what's in our hearts,

29:25.633 --> 29:28.114
even when we don't say it

29:28.114 --> 29:30.072
or if we say something
we don't mean.

29:31.595 --> 29:32.858
They know better.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.947
Dr. Marcel,

29:34.947 --> 29:37.950
do you think
I stress my mom out?

29:37.950 --> 29:41.127
I mean, she's always
doing everything for me.

29:41.127 --> 29:43.303
Maybe that's why she's sick.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.348
No way.

29:45.348 --> 29:47.133
Look, Ryan,

29:47.133 --> 29:48.830
there's not a lot of stuff
we can say

29:48.830 --> 29:50.440
with complete certainty
in medicine,

29:50.440 --> 29:53.095
but this I can say
with total confidence:

29:53.095 --> 29:55.271
you did nothing
to cause your mom's condition.

29:59.667 --> 30:04.063
Hey, you want to get something
from the gift shop there?

30:04.063 --> 30:07.501
For your mom and baby sister?

30:07.501 --> 30:09.024
My mom would like it

30:09.024 --> 30:12.114
if I wrote her a card
telling her I'm sorry.

30:12.114 --> 30:14.203
Okay, then let's go.

30:14.203 --> 30:16.205
Come on.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.991
So turns out
you're allergic to cefazolin.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.383
It's recorded
in your chart now,

30:20.383 --> 30:21.994
but it's still something
for you to be aware of.

30:21.994 --> 30:24.083
Cefazolin.
Cefazolin, cefazolin.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.345
Can you tell me
how to spell that?

30:25.345 --> 30:27.129
Sure.
Let me know when you're ready.

30:30.089 --> 30:32.221
You know what?
Never mind.

30:32.221 --> 30:34.223
Maybe I shouldn't
research everything.

30:34.223 --> 30:36.704
Clearly it doesn't always
lead to the best decisions.

30:36.704 --> 30:39.707
Hey, absolutely nothing wrong
with wanting to be informed.

30:39.707 --> 30:41.143
You are your own best advocate.

30:41.143 --> 30:44.973
Mm, I think--
I think my headache's gone.

30:44.973 --> 30:46.366
The medicine's working.

30:46.366 --> 30:48.063
- Excellent news.
- Yeah.

30:48.063 --> 30:49.325
Well,
I'll let you get some rest.

30:49.325 --> 30:52.894
Thank you, Dr. Halstead,
for everything.

30:56.942 --> 30:59.205
- Hey.
- What's up?

30:59.205 --> 31:01.816
I heard what happened.
Is your patient okay?

31:01.816 --> 31:03.426
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.080
And the biopsy?

31:05.080 --> 31:06.690
Well, pathology won't get
the results for at least a day,

31:06.690 --> 31:09.519
but Dr. Gordon said the vessel
looked totally healthy.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.826
What a waste of time
and resources.

31:11.826 --> 31:13.219
If you want to join me,

31:13.219 --> 31:15.917
I'm planning
on paying Goodwin a visit.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.397
What do you mean? Why?

31:17.397 --> 31:20.095
To let her know what
a disaster these upgrades are

31:20.095 --> 31:21.705
before they get
past the pilot phase.

31:21.705 --> 31:23.142
Mags, come on.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.057
Don't you think that's overkill
involving Goodwin?

31:25.057 --> 31:27.624
Will, patient care
has been compromised

31:27.624 --> 31:30.323
on multiple fronts today.
- Not intentionally.

31:30.323 --> 31:32.325
And Grace, she's still
working out the kinks.

31:32.325 --> 31:34.980
Well, I'm not trying
to sabotage Grace's efforts,

31:34.980 --> 31:36.590
but I'm also not gonna stand by

31:36.590 --> 31:39.332
while Dayton tries to
automate us all out of a job.

31:45.425 --> 31:46.774
Yeah?

31:46.774 --> 31:48.950
Yeah, uh...

31:48.950 --> 31:52.127
so Dr. Kwon agrees that
Kurt has decisional capacity.

31:52.127 --> 31:53.520
- Got it.
- Yeah.

31:53.520 --> 31:57.611
And he's signing the paperwork
to leave AMA.

31:57.611 --> 32:00.048
Appreciate the update.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.052
So, uh...

32:04.052 --> 32:07.142
I'm tied to a dialysis machine
most nights.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.710
And I'm currently
being evaluated

32:09.710 --> 32:11.668
for the transplant list.

32:15.716 --> 32:17.805
- I didn't know you were...
- That bad off?

32:17.805 --> 32:19.763
Yeah, me neither.

32:19.763 --> 32:23.028
Yeah, and once
I'm on the transplant list,

32:23.028 --> 32:25.030
I need to be
within a certain radius

32:25.030 --> 32:26.770
of the hospital
at all times.

32:29.034 --> 32:32.907
But suddenly my life
and my plans

32:32.907 --> 32:34.126
are being dictated
by my health.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.649
And so,
when I see this young guy,

32:35.649 --> 32:37.999
this picture of health,

32:37.999 --> 32:41.002
willingly giving it up,

32:41.002 --> 32:43.352
I made it personal,

32:43.352 --> 32:46.181
which you already probably
knew that I was doing

32:46.181 --> 32:49.489
because you're excellent
at what you do, Dan.

32:49.489 --> 32:51.752
And I shouldn't have
implied otherwise.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.712
All right.

33:03.111 --> 33:04.417
Hi.

33:04.417 --> 33:05.853
Oh, hey.

33:05.853 --> 33:08.551
Um...

33:08.551 --> 33:11.641
Your assistant let me in.
I hope you don't mind.

33:11.641 --> 33:14.122
No, not at all, and
thanks again for the flowers.

33:14.122 --> 33:17.038
They're lovely
but really quite unnecessary.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.431
- Sure.
- Thank you.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.650
Mm-hmm.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.915
All right.

33:24.915 --> 33:27.744
I-I got your voicemail.

33:27.744 --> 33:29.659
Well, you know
you could've just called me.

33:29.659 --> 33:31.705
You didn't have
to make the trip over.

33:31.705 --> 33:33.968
Yeah.

33:33.968 --> 33:36.057
After hearing your message,

33:36.057 --> 33:38.712
I called Jack,
and I asked him

33:38.712 --> 33:42.020
what this surprise
board meeting was about.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.283
All right.

33:46.589 --> 33:49.244
Jack has a proposal
on the table

33:49.244 --> 33:53.074
that would
drastically change...

33:53.074 --> 33:55.076
Med's future.

33:57.165 --> 33:58.688
Mm-hmm.

34:01.909 --> 34:04.259
Okay.

34:04.259 --> 34:05.739
First arm out.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.349
Towel.

34:09.656 --> 34:12.093
Here she comes.

34:12.093 --> 34:14.530
And there she is.

34:15.966 --> 34:17.446
Okay.

34:19.535 --> 34:23.583
All right, you have
a beautiful baby girl, Sarah.

34:23.583 --> 34:27.891
She is so excited
to meet her mama.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.810
I can't find a pulse.
Her heart stopped.

34:33.810 --> 34:36.465
Pack her abdomen.
I'll start compressions.

34:37.988 --> 34:39.294
Come on, Sarah.

34:39.294 --> 34:41.731
Stay with us.

34:41.731 --> 34:44.125
Charge to 200.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.648
Come on, Sarah.

34:48.825 --> 34:50.871
Come on.

35:20.030 --> 35:21.641
Oh, man.

35:29.301 --> 35:30.954
How's Ryan's aunt?

35:30.954 --> 35:31.912
She wanted to stay back
in the nursery

35:31.912 --> 35:33.522
with the baby a bit longer.

35:33.522 --> 35:35.437
How's he doing?
- Yeah.

35:35.437 --> 35:37.439
About what you'd expect.

35:37.439 --> 35:39.963
Oh, poor kid.

35:39.963 --> 35:42.314
His aunt and uncle
seem really great.

35:42.314 --> 35:44.490
- Mm-hmm.
- Gets along with his cousins.

35:44.490 --> 35:48.537
Yeah, Ryan and his baby
sister will be loved to pieces.

35:48.537 --> 35:52.715
His aunt made that very clear.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.848
Hey, walk with me.

35:56.806 --> 35:59.896
You know you did
everything you could, right?

35:59.896 --> 36:02.638
Sarah's heart was worse off
than we thought.

36:02.638 --> 36:05.728
Nothing we could've done
to change that.

36:05.728 --> 36:07.730
Sad truth.

36:07.730 --> 36:10.211
Only thing that
would've made a difference

36:10.211 --> 36:13.258
is if Sarah had come in earlier

36:13.258 --> 36:16.217
when she first started
experiencing symptoms.

36:19.220 --> 36:22.223
You know, my sister,
Elizabeth--Lizzy--

36:22.223 --> 36:25.313
she, uh...

36:25.313 --> 36:28.490
She was Ryan's age
when our mom died.

36:28.490 --> 36:30.884
I didn't know
you lost your mom as a kid.

36:30.884 --> 36:34.017
Lizzy and Matt--

36:34.017 --> 36:37.020
that's my brother--

36:37.020 --> 36:40.894
they had it the toughest

36:40.894 --> 36:44.027
'cause they really
remembered her.

36:44.027 --> 36:47.466
I never got to meet her.

36:49.032 --> 36:51.209
She died in childbirth with me.

36:52.993 --> 36:55.256
Aortic stenosis.
- Mm.

36:55.256 --> 36:57.998
Undiagnosed.

36:57.998 --> 36:59.869
I'm sorry to hear that.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.697
The doctor said
that he thought

37:01.697 --> 37:03.873
she was suffering with symptoms
during her pregnancy

37:03.873 --> 37:06.833
but she just downplayed it.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.226
Yeah, because like Sarah,

37:08.226 --> 37:11.968
she wanted to be the best mom
that she could be.

37:11.968 --> 37:14.232
To her, that meant
putting her kids first

37:14.232 --> 37:17.887
and herself last.

37:17.887 --> 37:21.064
Swallowing any pain
or discomfort

37:21.064 --> 37:25.373
so that she wouldn't
burden her kids.

37:25.373 --> 37:29.116
And still, to this day,
I am so angry at her for it.

37:30.552 --> 37:35.514
I'm so angry because
I never got to have my mom.

37:35.514 --> 37:37.951
I don't get to remember her.

37:40.083 --> 37:43.348
It's okay.

37:43.348 --> 37:46.307
It's all right.

37:46.307 --> 37:47.830
It's okay.

37:51.007 --> 37:52.792
Oh, hey, Lil.

37:52.792 --> 37:54.097
Liliana.

37:54.097 --> 37:57.405
- Oh, you're still here.
- Yeah.

37:57.405 --> 38:02.192
I was actually--I was kind of
hoping that I'd catch you.

38:02.192 --> 38:04.934
How's your day?
- Fine.

38:06.980 --> 38:10.810
You've given any more thought
to Vanna's house?

38:10.810 --> 38:13.813
Oh, yes.
Maybe not the best idea.

38:13.813 --> 38:15.031
Why?
'Cause of what I said?

38:15.031 --> 38:16.859
You made some good points.

38:16.859 --> 38:18.252
No.

38:18.252 --> 38:21.386
No, I made
some self-interested points.

38:21.386 --> 38:24.563
What do you mean
self-interested?

38:24.563 --> 38:27.174
You walked in here
this morning all excited

38:27.174 --> 38:30.786
about a beautiful little house
you'd found, right?

38:30.786 --> 38:32.048
Your dream house.

38:32.048 --> 38:35.574
And what I heard was

38:35.574 --> 38:39.491
that maybe you were
planning a future that didn't--

38:39.491 --> 38:44.365
you know,
that didn't involve me, so...

38:44.365 --> 38:50.371
Owning my own home has been
a goal for a long, long time.

38:50.371 --> 38:53.635
And the reason
that I feel ready now

38:53.635 --> 38:56.421
to take this leap of faith is--

38:56.421 --> 38:59.946
is really all your fault, Daniel.

38:59.946 --> 39:01.991
Because of you,

39:01.991 --> 39:06.300
I now know I want
to put down roots in Chicago.

39:07.693 --> 39:11.697
Despite its miserable winters.

39:11.697 --> 39:15.178
Remember, I'm from Poland.

39:15.178 --> 39:16.832
Yeah.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.804
Yes, it's Sharon Goodwin.

39:31.804 --> 39:35.111
I'd appreciate it if you
could get back to me tonight,

39:35.111 --> 39:36.765
if at all possible.

39:36.765 --> 39:39.681
Yes, I'll be up late.
Thank you.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.074
What's going on?

39:41.074 --> 39:42.510
We're trying to reach
every member of the board

39:42.510 --> 39:44.512
before Jack can
get to them first.

39:44.512 --> 39:48.211
He wants to convert Med
into a for-profit hospital.

39:48.211 --> 39:50.213
Turn it over to investors.

39:50.213 --> 39:53.173
- Can he do that?
- Well, he can certainly try.

39:53.173 --> 39:56.263
He wants to put it
to a board vote.

39:56.263 --> 39:58.613
I mean, if Jack succeeds,
there goes Med as we know it.

39:58.613 --> 40:01.703
Vital services that don't
generate enough income cut.

40:01.703 --> 40:03.705
We're gonna have to discharge
patients that can't pay.

40:03.705 --> 40:06.360
Yeah, I know. That's why
we're doing everything we can

40:06.360 --> 40:08.928
to make sure
he does not succeed.

40:08.928 --> 40:10.930
Look, I need
to make this next call.

40:10.930 --> 40:12.453
Did you need something?
- Oh, no.

40:12.453 --> 40:13.889
No, it can wait.
- You sure?

40:13.889 --> 40:15.456
- Yeah.
- All right.

40:18.372 --> 40:20.200
Hello?

40:22.985 --> 40:25.727
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me.

40:25.727 --> 40:27.250
Of course.

40:30.602 --> 40:31.907
Rough day?

40:31.907 --> 40:34.475
Yeah, rough day.

40:34.475 --> 40:36.434
What's going on?

40:38.784 --> 40:40.133
I...

40:42.396 --> 40:45.486
I need to tell you something.

40:45.486 --> 40:47.662
Okay.

40:47.662 --> 40:49.229
It's about your dad.

40:49.229 --> 40:53.407
And he can't know that you
learned this from me, but...

40:55.540 --> 40:58.456
Look, if it was my parent,
I'd want to know, so...

40:59.805 --> 41:01.459
What is it?

41:03.112 --> 41:05.463
Hannah, please.

41:07.203 --> 41:09.423
His health is getting worse.
