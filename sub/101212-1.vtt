02:36.749 --> 02:39.850
- Can I help you?
- Just browsing, thanks.

03:56.428 --> 03:57.861
Trent.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.129
Hey, I know you're there.

04:01.133 --> 04:02.999
Okay, you're probably studying.

04:03.001 --> 04:05.535
Anyway, I'm on my way over.

04:05.537 --> 04:08.372
We're going to pick out
rings today, remember?

04:08.374 --> 04:12.909
So I'll be there in
like five minutes, okay?

04:12.911 --> 04:14.711
Love you, bye.

04:46.412 --> 04:47.644
What's wrong with you?

04:51.750 --> 04:52.682
Jesus.

04:52.684 --> 04:54.918
Could you have possible
found an apartment on the

04:54.920 --> 04:56.853
second floor instead of the
fifth?

04:58.090 --> 04:59.756
Why didn't you take the
elevator?

04:59.758 --> 05:02.459
Ah, it wasn't
working, again.

05:03.529 --> 05:05.345
And that guy who works here,

05:05.347 --> 05:07.164
he's always somewhere
and just hanging out.

05:07.166 --> 05:08.665
Who, John?

05:09.635 --> 05:10.567
He's harmless.

05:12.504 --> 05:13.837
You're so dramatic.

05:15.974 --> 05:16.907
Maybe.

05:18.544 --> 05:20.677
He creeps me out.

05:20.679 --> 05:22.846
We're getting a new apartment
when you're done with school.

05:22.848 --> 05:25.549
I am not walking up five
flights of stairs forever.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.088
You're so cute.

05:37.062 --> 05:38.528
I could just eat you up.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.067
Five minutes and we'll go,
okay?

05:44.069 --> 05:46.002
Okay, five minutes.

05:46.839 --> 05:48.238
Hurry up.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.140
We have some serious shopping to
do.

05:55.247 --> 05:57.881
Oh, I ran into Amy Pringle
today.

05:57.883 --> 05:58.815
Remember her?

05:58.817 --> 06:02.986
We met her last summer over at
Joe's?

06:02.988 --> 06:08.058
Cute, cropped hair, big boobs.

06:09.728 --> 06:11.828
She's going out with that lawyer
Patrick.

06:14.933 --> 06:15.866
Anyway.

06:17.569 --> 06:20.537
She's pregnant and she's keeping
it, can you believe that?

06:24.810 --> 06:27.210
Jesus, a kid's the last
thing I would want right now.

06:31.183 --> 06:32.883
And he's so gross, I can't
figure out

06:32.885 --> 06:34.150
why she has sex with him.

06:38.090 --> 06:39.990
Maybe he has a really big cock.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.060
Would you mind closing the
door

06:44.062 --> 06:45.562
when you use the bathroom?

06:47.032 --> 06:48.231
It's not very ladylike.

06:49.801 --> 06:52.235
Really, and who said I was a
lady?

06:55.274 --> 06:56.206
Are you done yet?

06:59.678 --> 07:00.610
Yes.

07:10.989 --> 07:11.922
Shit.

07:12.958 --> 07:14.925
This is so annoying!

07:29.775 --> 07:30.707
Trent.

07:30.709 --> 07:34.711
Hey man, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to scare you like that.

07:36.181 --> 07:38.481
Sorry about the elevator, dude.

07:38.483 --> 07:40.784
It's this old building, it's
got a lot of quirks, you know?

07:40.786 --> 07:42.152
It's okay.

07:42.154 --> 07:44.054
Um, hey, I put a check
in the mail for you,

07:44.056 --> 07:45.121
you should get it in a few days.

07:45.123 --> 07:46.823
Nice, nice, thank you.

07:46.825 --> 07:48.325
I appreciate that.

07:48.327 --> 07:49.693
So how you doing?

07:51.597 --> 07:53.063
You're getting hitched soon,
right?

07:54.900 --> 07:57.233
- Five weeks.
- Five weeks, wow.

07:57.235 --> 08:00.370
My old lady and I living
together for 20 years.

08:00.372 --> 08:01.738
Married for 16.

08:03.008 --> 08:04.941
Lived our first four years in
sin.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.176
But I gotta tell you those
are the best four years

08:06.178 --> 08:07.110
of my life, huh?

08:10.849 --> 08:12.649
I need to ask you a favor,
Trent.

08:13.719 --> 08:16.086
Uh, sure, yeah, alright.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.788
It's my father in law.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.390
I gotta find him a place to
stay.

08:21.693 --> 08:23.693
Uh, I don't, uh...

08:23.695 --> 08:26.363
It'd just be for maybe two
or three days at the most.

08:26.365 --> 08:28.965
Listen, I'd make it worth your
while.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.101
I don't know, Mr. Morris.

08:32.270 --> 08:33.703
You're getting married.

08:33.705 --> 08:36.405
What if I give you two
months' rent for free?

08:36.408 --> 08:37.841
Okay?

08:37.842 --> 08:38.975
You need the money, come on,

08:38.977 --> 08:40.844
you're getting married for
christsake.

08:40.846 --> 08:43.013
I don't know, Mr. Morris.

08:44.383 --> 08:46.116
I don't even know him.

08:46.118 --> 08:47.751
Why doesn't he stay with you?

08:47.753 --> 08:51.154
Well my wife and him, they
don't get along so well.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.188
And, uh...

08:52.190 --> 08:54.891
Listen, I can help you here,
okay?

08:54.893 --> 08:57.027
But you gotta help me back.

08:57.029 --> 08:57.994
Alright?

08:57.996 --> 08:59.095
He's a good guy.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.098
What do you say, can you help me
out?

09:04.069 --> 09:05.368
Sure.

09:23.689 --> 09:24.688
I love you.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.463
Yeah.

09:36.268 --> 09:37.834
You better watch it, buster.

09:39.237 --> 09:40.704
I love you too.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.774
I'm not getting into trouble.

09:44.776 --> 09:45.709
No?

10:05.263 --> 10:07.464
I can't believe I'm doing this.

10:07.466 --> 10:08.398
What?

10:19.244 --> 10:20.977
The rings we picked out today.

10:20.979 --> 10:23.813
Are you sure you can afford
them?

10:25.751 --> 10:28.051
They're very, very beautiful.

10:29.221 --> 10:30.320
But they're expensive.

10:30.322 --> 10:34.324
And you know my parents are
more than willing to help.

10:34.326 --> 10:35.225
I know.

10:36.228 --> 10:37.227
I know they are.

10:37.229 --> 10:40.296
They're already paying for
everything.

10:40.298 --> 10:42.799
I know, I know baby, I just...

10:44.803 --> 10:47.036
I don't want you to have the
extra stress.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.173
I need to do this.

10:52.177 --> 10:55.912
It'll only be hard for a few
months and

10:56.915 --> 10:58.181
then I'll have graduated.

10:59.151 --> 11:00.817
Mm, I trust you.

11:29.014 --> 11:30.947
Maybe you shouldn't.

12:55.634 --> 12:56.599
I can't.

12:57.469 --> 12:58.368
I can't do that.

12:59.504 --> 13:01.037
We've talked about this.

13:03.308 --> 13:04.240
I know.

13:04.242 --> 13:09.479
You know how I feel about
that.

13:09.481 --> 13:11.915
I know baby but we're gonna be
married

13:11.917 --> 13:13.349
in just a couple weeks.

13:14.386 --> 13:16.386
What would it hurt?

13:16.388 --> 13:17.320
Who would know?

13:19.291 --> 13:20.223
I would know.

13:25.397 --> 13:26.329
Okay.

13:31.369 --> 13:32.568
I get it.

13:38.243 --> 13:39.175
Don't leave.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.383
Tell me you want me.

13:51.022 --> 13:52.689
I want you.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.996
Tell me you wanna be inside
me.

14:08.606 --> 14:09.505
Baby.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.009
I want you inside me.

14:14.412 --> 14:17.981
I wanna feel, I wanna pull you
inside me

14:17.983 --> 14:19.515
and hold you there.

15:23.148 --> 15:25.548
- You need the money.
- Hey, I know you're there.

15:30.455 --> 15:32.822
The rings we picked out today.

15:32.824 --> 15:38.094
Are you sure you can afford
them?

15:39.597 --> 15:42.265
- You need the money.
- We could just...

15:42.267 --> 15:44.801
He's a good guy.

15:47.639 --> 15:49.105
You're so cute.

15:49.107 --> 15:51.707
Two months' rent.

16:07.392 --> 16:08.591
Hey, you know what the best
thing is

16:08.593 --> 16:10.660
about fucking 25 year olds is?

16:13.798 --> 16:14.730
I don't know.

16:15.567 --> 16:16.666
There's 20 of them.

16:20.138 --> 16:20.870
I'm Trent.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.372
Marvin.

16:25.543 --> 16:27.276
It's nice to meet you, Marvin.

16:28.213 --> 16:29.312
Listen, I'd really appreciate it

16:29.314 --> 16:31.380
if you didn't smoke in here.

16:31.382 --> 16:32.315
Okay?

16:33.651 --> 16:35.218
Please don't touch my things.

16:44.362 --> 16:45.661
Oh yeah, your girlfriend
called.

16:45.663 --> 16:48.498
She said she was sorry about
last night

16:48.500 --> 16:50.266
and that you should call her.

17:01.146 --> 17:02.578
Hello, Trent?

17:03.648 --> 17:05.414
I guess you're not home.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.450
Or you just don't wanna talk to
me.

17:07.452 --> 17:10.720
Anyway, um, I just wanted to
tell you

17:10.722 --> 17:13.222
that I'm going to New York for
one day.

17:13.223 --> 17:14.506
- Hmm.
- Uh...

17:14.508 --> 17:15.790
- She sounds sexy.
- There's a gallery opening

17:15.792 --> 17:18.294
up and they wanna talk
to me about a showing.

17:18.296 --> 17:22.265
And that I don't respect
your wishes, well sometimes...

17:22.267 --> 17:23.310
What, you don't believe in
sex?

17:23.311 --> 17:24.355
- I just think that...
- Could you please?

17:24.357 --> 17:25.401
- I'm trying to hear this.
- Maybe we should

17:25.403 --> 17:26.602
try and explore.

17:27.805 --> 17:29.371
I don't know.

17:29.373 --> 17:30.940
Anyway, I'm sorry I offended
you.

17:30.942 --> 17:32.308
Call me when you get this,

17:32.310 --> 17:33.676
I'll see you in a couple days.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.578
Okay?

17:35.580 --> 17:36.512
Ciao.

17:37.815 --> 17:40.516
Hey why don't they have
sex ed and driver's ed

17:40.518 --> 17:42.185
in Mexico on the same day?

17:45.590 --> 17:48.457
It's too hard on the fucking
donkeys.

17:53.331 --> 17:55.598
Hey have you ever been to a
donkey show?

17:55.600 --> 17:57.400
- No.
- Really?

17:57.402 --> 17:58.834
It's something else.

17:58.836 --> 18:01.304
You oughta, you oughta
check it out sometime.

18:15.620 --> 18:16.552
Yeah.

18:17.388 --> 18:18.421
Yeah, I understand.

18:19.991 --> 18:23.326
No, it's okay, I'm not
mad at you, you just,

18:24.929 --> 18:27.964
you just had a little too much
to drink and you were happy.

18:30.568 --> 18:31.901
I was happy too.

18:31.903 --> 18:34.237
Man, you know, I still am.

18:36.674 --> 18:38.741
Uh, I gotta go.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.677
Um, let me call you back.

18:41.679 --> 18:45.815
No no no no, let me just
call you back, okay, okay?

18:47.418 --> 18:48.351
Alright, bye.

18:50.321 --> 18:51.254
Excuse me.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.257
Could you please flush?

18:55.260 --> 18:56.359
It's kinda gross.

18:56.361 --> 18:57.293
Oh, sorry.

18:58.863 --> 19:00.263
Was that your old lady?

19:03.868 --> 19:04.967
You know, the chick from last
night,

19:04.969 --> 19:06.669
the one that wants to bang you.

19:09.474 --> 19:11.774
Yeah, that's my fiancee,
Jackie.

19:17.815 --> 19:18.848
So, uh...

19:20.852 --> 19:22.952
So this girl, she's your
fiancee.

19:25.023 --> 19:26.756
You haven't fucked her?

19:26.758 --> 19:29.392
I don't believe
in sex before marriage.

19:30.061 --> 19:31.394
What?

19:31.396 --> 19:32.862
You're kidding me!

19:33.965 --> 19:35.798
Well wait a minute, you're
telling me that

19:35.800 --> 19:38.801
your fiancee is begging you to
fuck her

19:38.803 --> 19:39.869
and you won't do it?

19:41.673 --> 19:44.807
I believe that if we
really love each other

19:44.809 --> 19:45.875
then we should wait.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.978
So you're a Jesus freak.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.447
No, I'm not a Jesus
freak.

19:51.449 --> 19:56.552
I was raised very religious
but I'm not religious now.

19:58.423 --> 20:00.556
What do you mean you're not
religious?

20:00.558 --> 20:02.091
You won't fuck until you're
married?

20:02.093 --> 20:04.493
The only people I know
like that are religious.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.669
What kind of job you getting?

20:13.671 --> 20:15.971
I'm almost done with
law school.

20:18.743 --> 20:21.911
Just what the world needs,
another fucking lawyer.

20:21.913 --> 20:25.047
So what do you get when you
send a prostitute to law school?

20:26.551 --> 20:27.950
I don't know, what?

20:29.020 --> 20:30.519
Fucking know it all.

20:33.991 --> 20:36.859
What can a goose do, a duck
can't, and a lawyer should?

20:40.698 --> 20:41.697
I'm not sure.

20:43.801 --> 20:45.401
Stick his bill up his ass.

21:02.954 --> 21:05.488
So what's the deal with all the
cars?

21:07.458 --> 21:08.657
It's morning, isn't it?

21:12.730 --> 21:13.662
I don't know.

21:15.099 --> 21:17.032
Something I started
doing when I was a kid.

21:18.169 --> 21:20.035
Dad gave me the first car.

21:37.522 --> 21:40.523
- Eh?
- No thanks.

21:40.525 --> 21:41.724
You don't smoke weed?

21:44.462 --> 21:47.430
Kind of a trippy fucker, aren't
you?

21:47.432 --> 21:50.566
You don't smoke weed, you
don't drink, you don't fuck.

21:51.669 --> 21:52.835
What do you do for fun?

21:56.040 --> 21:57.039
You clean house?

22:00.711 --> 22:04.079
Well, uh, I better get going.

22:04.081 --> 22:05.548
I have class in a moment.

22:09.921 --> 22:13.756
So I guess I'll see you later.

23:46.651 --> 23:48.672
Is that Jackie?

23:48.674 --> 23:50.695
Hello,
we are not available now.

23:50.697 --> 23:52.719
Please leave your name and
phone number after the beep.

23:52.723 --> 23:53.789
We will return your call.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.126
Hello?

23:57.128 --> 23:58.694
Is anyone home?

23:59.564 --> 24:01.697
Trent, you screening your calls?

24:02.767 --> 24:05.100
Jesus, I wish you'd get a cell
phone.

24:05.102 --> 24:07.903
Uh, so I just got in from New
York

24:07.905 --> 24:10.739
and I wanted to see you but
I was calling to tell you

24:10.741 --> 24:14.243
that I'm on my way over and
I have a surprise for you.

24:14.245 --> 24:15.811
But I won't be there for a
little while,

24:15.813 --> 24:18.180
maybe 30 or 40 minutes.

24:18.182 --> 24:19.648
I need to make a stop first.

24:19.650 --> 24:20.616
Okay.

24:20.618 --> 24:21.350
Ciao.

25:02.226 --> 25:03.158
Trent.

25:04.061 --> 25:05.394
Oh.

25:07.564 --> 25:09.731
Uh, I'm sorry, I was
looking for Trent, so...

25:09.734 --> 25:11.233
You must be Jackie.

25:11.235 --> 25:12.617
Yeah.

25:12.619 --> 25:14.002
You're even more beautiful
than Trent described.

25:14.872 --> 25:16.421
Thank you.

25:16.423 --> 25:17.973
Um, I'm sorry, I don't know who
you are.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.742
Oh, excuse me, my name is
Marvin.

25:19.744 --> 25:21.010
And Trent's being gracious
enough

25:21.012 --> 25:23.312
to let me stay with him for a
few days.

25:27.218 --> 25:31.153
Just between you and me,
I'm in between homes.

25:32.957 --> 25:35.658
But please come in,
you're welcome to wait.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.393
Trent just stepped out for a
moment.

25:38.295 --> 25:39.962
We could have a glass of wine.

25:41.032 --> 25:42.931
It's rare that I get the company

25:42.933 --> 25:44.733
of such a beautiful lady.

25:46.404 --> 25:47.936
Sure, uh...

25:49.440 --> 25:50.372
Yeah.

25:54.879 --> 25:58.013
So you mean to say that
you were selling diamonds

25:58.015 --> 26:00.382
in Vietnam to the guys in the
jungle?

26:00.384 --> 26:01.984
Yeah.

26:01.986 --> 26:02.918
Exactly.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.087
But I made good money.

26:07.091 --> 26:08.390
All I had to do is go
out there in the field

26:08.392 --> 26:11.927
with those guys and tell them
they needed

26:11.929 --> 26:14.329
to send something to
their girls back home.

26:14.331 --> 26:15.264
And that was it.

26:16.333 --> 26:18.000
A lot of them didn't believe

26:18.002 --> 26:20.335
they were gonna be coming
back home anyway, so.

26:20.337 --> 26:23.806
If they could send something
beautiful

26:23.808 --> 26:26.475
to their girls back home,
it made it a little better.

26:28.379 --> 26:30.145
Can you understand that?

26:30.147 --> 26:31.013
Yeah.

26:31.015 --> 26:33.948
Yeah, I understand.

26:33.950 --> 26:36.884
It seems, I just seems kinda
fucked up.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.253
Oh.

26:38.255 --> 26:40.823
That whole conflict was fucked
up.

26:40.825 --> 26:43.726
Yeah, well all war
is fucked up, I guess.

26:43.728 --> 26:45.060
Yeah.

26:45.996 --> 26:47.396
- Want more?
- Join in.

26:51.235 --> 26:54.903
Gracias.

26:59.477 --> 27:02.077
You know how to salsa.

27:02.079 --> 27:03.412
Would you like to dance?

27:05.850 --> 27:07.483
Whoa, si, you speak Spanish
also?

27:10.971 --> 27:12.121
I'm fluent in five languages.

27:12.990 --> 27:14.188
Five languages?

27:14.190 --> 27:15.389
- Mm hmm.
- Wow, which ones?

27:15.392 --> 27:17.926
Whoops, sorry, I'm a little
rusty here.

27:18.796 --> 27:19.894
It's okay.

27:19.896 --> 27:20.995
You're a very good dancer
though.

27:20.998 --> 27:22.431
You dance much?

27:22.433 --> 27:24.199
Uh, I used to dance.

27:24.201 --> 27:26.835
I do go out with my girlfriends
sometimes.

27:26.837 --> 27:30.038
Well you and Trent seem
to be very different.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.841
Yes, he grounds me.

27:32.843 --> 27:33.976
I was pretty wild.

27:33.978 --> 27:35.944
Does that make sense?

27:35.946 --> 27:38.280
I guess if you wanna be
grounded.

27:38.282 --> 27:42.518
I mean, how long have
you two been engaged?

27:42.520 --> 27:45.120
Uh, three months, we've
been together for six.

27:45.122 --> 27:46.237
Six?

27:46.239 --> 27:47.355
You've been together for
six months and you're

27:47.358 --> 27:48.290
gonna get married.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.126
I know.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.095
It's pretty evolved myself,
getting married, to be honest.

27:53.097 --> 27:55.464
Well, everybody should
be married once I guess.

27:56.834 --> 27:58.433
Have you ever been married?

27:58.435 --> 28:02.137
Yeah, I was married
once, a long time ago.

28:03.574 --> 28:04.573
Ooh, ooh!

28:10.080 --> 28:11.180
You mind if I get a drag?

28:11.182 --> 28:12.114
Oh not at all.

28:13.050 --> 28:13.982
Thank you.

28:19.123 --> 28:20.556
Don't tell Trent.

28:20.558 --> 28:22.457
Oh, your secret's safe with
me.

28:23.927 --> 28:25.394
I don't usually smoke but

28:27.865 --> 28:29.965
at times like this I enjoy a
drag or two.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.235
I can understand that.

28:38.142 --> 28:39.541
What about weed?

28:39.543 --> 28:40.409
You smoke that?

28:40.411 --> 28:42.911
I love to smoke pot.

28:43.581 --> 28:45.580
I love to smoke pot.

28:45.582 --> 28:47.582
Well I have some, you
wanna smoke some with me.

28:47.585 --> 28:49.184
Really, you have some here?

28:49.186 --> 28:51.019
Well it's not here,
it's in the Bat Cave.

28:51.021 --> 28:51.954
Ah.

28:53.206 --> 28:54.455
But I can get to it quickly.

28:54.458 --> 28:57.492
You're a very
interesting fellow, Marvin.

28:57.494 --> 29:02.564
Adventurer, dancer, you speak
five languages, crime fighter.

29:02.566 --> 29:04.566
Any more surprises?

29:05.435 --> 29:06.301
Baby, you don't even know.

29:08.049 --> 29:09.793
Now if you'll excuse me I'll
retreat

29:09.795 --> 29:11.540
to the Bat Cave to
retrieve the secret weapon.

29:11.542 --> 29:13.508
Oh please, be my guest.

29:14.378 --> 29:15.344
I have one for you.

29:16.180 --> 29:17.479
Okay.

29:17.481 --> 29:21.149
So what is green,

29:24.120 --> 29:27.088
green, wet, and smells like pig?

29:29.059 --> 29:34.229
Uh, uh, uh,
just a big green slimy pig.

29:34.231 --> 29:37.099
No, Kermit the Frog's fingers.

29:37.101 --> 29:39.001
Oh!

29:39.003 --> 29:40.435
All the fingers?

29:40.437 --> 29:41.370
Oh man!

29:44.909 --> 29:46.041
Jesus Christ!

29:50.247 --> 29:52.314
Oh my god, Miss Piggy.

29:54.051 --> 29:55.284
That's a good one.

29:55.286 --> 29:57.219
That reminds me of one I, you
know,

29:57.221 --> 30:00.355
you can tell who your
best friend is, you know,

30:00.357 --> 30:02.190
by if you take your dog and your
wife

30:02.192 --> 30:03.492
and you stick 'em in the trunk
of your car

30:03.494 --> 30:06.061
for about a couple hours, you
let 'em out,

30:06.063 --> 30:07.396
you'll find out who your best
friend is.

30:07.398 --> 30:08.430
Oh!

30:10.701 --> 30:15.203
What do you call an Ethiopian
with a yeast infection?

30:16.140 --> 30:17.272
No fucking clue.

30:17.274 --> 30:19.308
Quarter pounder with
cheese.

30:19.310 --> 30:20.409
- No way!
- Eew!

30:21.612 --> 30:23.545
You did not just say that!

30:23.547 --> 30:25.113
You're gonna have
to calm me down this time,

30:25.115 --> 30:27.015
I'm not gonna do it.

30:27.017 --> 30:28.617
I'm not gonna do it.

30:29.687 --> 30:30.953
Oh no, no!

30:32.456 --> 30:34.556
- Oh man.
- You're bad.

30:34.558 --> 30:37.592
To the bone, bad to
the bone.

30:37.594 --> 30:42.197
You're really, oh shit, I'm
out.

30:42.199 --> 30:44.566
- Oh, me too.
- It's all gone.

30:49.473 --> 30:52.207
So we're gonna do this
again and I'm gonna come

30:52.209 --> 30:54.977
armed with better joke material.

30:54.979 --> 30:56.144
Well that sounds great, you
know,

30:56.146 --> 30:57.412
we'll have a joke off.

30:57.414 --> 30:59.081
Okay.

30:59.083 --> 31:01.183
But next time we gotta have
Trent here.

31:01.185 --> 31:02.184
Trent.

31:15.366 --> 31:16.698
What the fuck?

31:33.384 --> 31:36.385
Hello, is anyone
home?

31:36.387 --> 31:38.353
Trent, you screening your calls?

31:38.355 --> 31:40.489
Jesus, I wish you'd get a cell
phone.

31:40.491 --> 31:43.458
So I just got in from New York

31:43.460 --> 31:46.361
and I wanted to see you but
I was calling to tell you

31:46.363 --> 31:49.331
that I'm on my way over and
I have a surprise for you.

31:55.539 --> 31:56.671
Please leave a message.

31:57.890 --> 31:59.106
Hey babe, I just got your
message.

31:59.109 --> 32:00.375
Sorry I was out studying.

32:01.245 --> 32:02.677
Anyway, looks like you had

32:02.679 --> 32:05.047
a pretty good time over here.

32:06.416 --> 32:07.782
Can see you met my new house
guest.

32:07.785 --> 32:10.385
Hope he didn't scare you too
bad.

32:11.789 --> 32:14.489
Anyway, um, I'd love to see you.

32:14.491 --> 32:17.592
See what kind of surprise you
have for me.

32:17.594 --> 32:21.797
Um, let's maybe have lunch
tomorrow.

32:23.333 --> 32:25.133
Anyway, give me a call when you
get this

32:25.135 --> 32:26.435
and we'll figure it out.

32:26.437 --> 32:27.402
Okay, bye.

32:58.168 --> 33:00.202
Where were you yesterday
afternoon?

33:00.204 --> 33:01.403
I was out studying.

33:01.405 --> 33:05.173
Oh, hey that's a coincidence,
I was studying too.

33:06.477 --> 33:07.876
You know what I was studying?

33:09.279 --> 33:13.248
I was studying your fiancee's
sweet ass.

33:14.251 --> 33:15.717
Oh my god!

33:16.587 --> 33:19.321
Oh that girl is fine.

33:19.323 --> 33:20.755
Mm, mm, mm.

33:20.757 --> 33:21.890
Hey.

33:21.892 --> 33:23.892
Hey, you don't mind if I take
her out

33:23.894 --> 33:26.128
for a test drive, do ya?

33:26.130 --> 33:27.262
You know what they say,

33:27.264 --> 33:28.697
use it or lose it, right?

33:30.200 --> 33:31.566
Hey, hey, you know what?

33:31.568 --> 33:35.403
I can keep her tuned up
for ya, how about that?

33:35.405 --> 33:36.371
Huh?

33:40.544 --> 33:42.310
Stuck up motherfucker.

33:54.391 --> 33:57.592
What you having today, pal?

33:57.594 --> 34:00.462
Shot of whiskey
and a beer, chaser.

34:00.464 --> 34:01.663
Mm, alright.

34:05.269 --> 34:07.802
I can't be any more explicit
right now.

34:07.804 --> 34:09.571
Explicit, what
the hell does that mean?

34:10.873 --> 34:12.507
To like form the stuff

34:12.509 --> 34:13.909
that I'm thinking of saying.

34:14.710 --> 34:15.643
Until, you know.

34:19.882 --> 34:22.551
That's what's known as a
generous pour.

34:22.553 --> 34:24.819
I'm trying to get the cobwebs
out.

34:24.821 --> 34:26.955
That's a good
thing, get rid of those.

34:26.956 --> 34:27.889
Salud.

34:32.596 --> 34:34.529
I'll keep you company for a
little while.

34:36.466 --> 34:37.331
Okay.

34:37.333 --> 34:38.783
Yeah, uh...

34:38.784 --> 34:40.235
- What's your name?
- One more of those.

34:40.237 --> 34:41.937
I'm Marvin Decker.

34:41.938 --> 34:43.737
Joe, Joe Pitcock.

34:45.442 --> 34:47.208
Or like James Bond.

34:47.210 --> 34:50.212
Remember James Bond he used
to say Bond, James Bond?

34:50.214 --> 34:52.029
Right right right
right.

34:52.031 --> 34:53.847
So I'm trying to be cool
and now I'm gonna say Pitcock,

34:53.850 --> 34:55.217
Joe Pitcock.

34:56.687 --> 34:58.753
That's kind of a cool name.

34:58.755 --> 35:00.922
Nice to meet you Joe, you know I
like,

35:00.924 --> 35:03.225
I always like to know the name

35:03.227 --> 35:05.360
of the man who's serving me
drinks.

35:06.230 --> 35:07.328
Back, give it back.

35:07.330 --> 35:08.428
Just gotta get up to there.

35:08.430 --> 35:09.529
Give it back, give it back.

35:12.269 --> 35:13.001
Okay cowboy.

35:17.541 --> 35:19.241
So what's your story?

35:19.243 --> 35:20.976
Is it always this slow?

35:20.978 --> 35:22.477
Oh it picks up
after a while, you know,

35:22.479 --> 35:24.246
people start coming in.

35:25.315 --> 35:26.580
Kinda lonely right now,

35:26.582 --> 35:27.848
that's the way it starts out
usually.

35:30.520 --> 35:31.453
Yeah.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.756
- Drink up buddy.
- Yeah man.

35:43.867 --> 35:46.601
What's the deal with Marvin?

35:47.471 --> 35:48.953
Well.

35:48.955 --> 35:50.438
He's staying with me for a few
days.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.540
Yeah I know, but why?

35:52.542 --> 35:54.275
You're not really the kind of
guy

35:54.277 --> 35:56.011
who invites random
strangers to live with them.

35:57.547 --> 35:59.814
Yeah it wasn't really my idea,

35:59.816 --> 36:01.383
he was kind of forced on me.

36:02.452 --> 36:03.818
How was he forced on you?

36:05.922 --> 36:07.922
Um, I'm doing my landlord a
favor.

36:08.859 --> 36:11.960
Marvin is his father in law.

36:11.962 --> 36:12.894
Mm.

36:12.896 --> 36:16.598
So why is he staying with
you and not your landlord?

36:18.535 --> 36:20.635
I am really not sure to be
honest.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.807
Well he's a very interesting
man.

36:25.809 --> 36:28.076
Did you know that he was
thrown overboard in a storm

36:28.078 --> 36:30.312
and he was floating in
the ocean for six days

36:30.314 --> 36:31.546
before they found him?

36:31.548 --> 36:33.882
Yeah, he told me that.

36:36.019 --> 36:37.052
But there's no way.

36:38.355 --> 36:39.788
What do you mean there's no
way?

36:39.790 --> 36:41.623
I mean there's no way
that he could have survived

36:41.625 --> 36:43.892
for six days in the ocean on a
life vest.

36:43.894 --> 36:46.594
He didn't have water.

36:46.596 --> 36:48.763
You can't live for six days
without water.

36:50.367 --> 36:52.033
How do you know he had no
water?

36:53.570 --> 36:54.669
Hmm?

36:57.040 --> 37:02.110
Because there's no water
on a life vest, okay?

37:02.112 --> 37:04.379
Maybe on a raft.

37:04.381 --> 37:05.947
Not on a life vest.

37:05.949 --> 37:07.982
I know there's no
water on a fucking vest.

37:07.984 --> 37:10.618
You don't have to talk
to me like I'm a child.

37:10.620 --> 37:13.555
What I wanna know is how you
know that he had no water.

37:15.659 --> 37:18.225
No, but...

37:18.227 --> 37:20.794
You assumed and in
the process you decided

37:20.797 --> 37:25.400
he's a liar and that I'm
stupid for believing him.

37:25.402 --> 37:27.702
I don't know that it's like
that.

37:27.704 --> 37:31.439
It's just, it's deductive
reasoning.

37:31.441 --> 37:34.676
So you deducted that he's
a liar and I'm stupid, right?

37:36.747 --> 37:37.746
I wouldn't...

37:38.949 --> 37:42.050
No, I mean, I wouldn't put it
like that.

37:44.154 --> 37:46.654
He tells these fanciful stories

37:46.656 --> 37:50.458
and then when you look at
the facts, it doesn't add up.

37:50.460 --> 37:51.860
Hmm.

37:51.862 --> 37:53.477
Why are you defending him,
anyway?

37:53.479 --> 37:55.095
I'm defending him because
I had a wonderful time

37:55.098 --> 37:57.098
with him the other day.

37:57.100 --> 38:02.137
I mean, he's charming, he's
handsome, he's well-spoken.

38:02.139 --> 38:03.905
He told me he knew how to salsa,

38:03.907 --> 38:06.741
he was actually really good.

38:06.743 --> 38:08.977
He speaks five languages.

38:08.979 --> 38:09.978
- Yeah, alright, okay...
- Fluently, don't,

38:09.980 --> 38:11.713
don't fuckin' interrupt me.

38:11.715 --> 38:12.647
I'm talking.

38:14.885 --> 38:16.117
Ugh.

38:16.119 --> 38:17.585
I'm a little drunk, I...

38:23.593 --> 38:24.592
I'm gonna go home.

38:26.029 --> 38:27.695
Wait wait wait wait,
where are you going?

38:27.697 --> 38:28.563
Don't you think you're
overreacting a little?

38:28.565 --> 38:29.530
I'm going home.

38:29.532 --> 38:30.498
There are things I need to think
about.

38:30.500 --> 38:31.433
Wait!

38:32.035 --> 38:32.967
Please.

40:12.102 --> 40:14.202
- She's an amazing artist.
- Excuse me?

40:14.204 --> 40:17.739
Oh, I was saying
she's an amazing artist.

40:17.741 --> 40:20.575
Oh, oh, I wouldn't know.

40:20.577 --> 40:23.545
Um, I have a friend who's a
photographer

40:23.547 --> 40:25.813
so I was just looking for books
for her.

40:25.815 --> 40:26.948
Oh, I see, I see.

40:28.084 --> 40:30.184
You know, you look very
familiar.

40:30.186 --> 40:31.586
I think I've seen you before.

40:31.588 --> 40:33.288
My name's Paul Oakley.

40:33.290 --> 40:34.222
Trent Harris.

40:35.692 --> 40:37.625
Yeah, I know where I know you
from.

40:37.627 --> 40:40.762
You work the night desk
at the Ambassador, right?

40:40.764 --> 40:42.564
I go there with friends from
time to time

40:42.566 --> 40:43.831
to go to the lounge.

40:44.768 --> 40:46.301
Oh, right, right.

40:48.338 --> 40:51.339
Right, well I kinda gotta get
going.

40:51.341 --> 40:53.308
It was really nice to meet you.

40:53.310 --> 40:54.742
Paul.

40:54.744 --> 40:55.810
Trent, right?

40:55.812 --> 40:56.878
Yes.

40:56.880 --> 40:58.246
Yes.

40:58.248 --> 40:59.814
Well it was nice meeting you.

40:59.816 --> 41:00.982
I'm sure I'll see you around.

41:00.984 --> 41:02.650
Well what are you doing now?

41:02.652 --> 41:08.122
Um, I just, I have to meet
a friend in a little bit.

41:08.124 --> 41:09.724
There's a wine bar
right around the corner,

41:09.726 --> 41:11.893
a place I wanna try.

41:11.895 --> 41:13.261
Do you like wine?

41:13.263 --> 41:16.164
Uh yeah, yeah, yeah, I like
wine.

41:16.166 --> 41:17.865
Great, why don't you join me?

41:17.867 --> 41:18.933
If you have time.

41:20.170 --> 41:21.202
Um...

41:23.673 --> 41:26.874
Um, sure, sure.

41:28.744 --> 41:30.611
Sure, I can't stay all that
long.

41:30.614 --> 41:32.680
Great, we'll just drop
in and check the place out,

41:32.682 --> 41:34.148
be spontaneous.

41:34.150 --> 41:35.383
- Sound fun?
- Yeah.

41:35.385 --> 41:36.250
- Great.
- That sounds good.

41:36.252 --> 41:37.251
Great.

41:37.253 --> 41:39.354
Aren't you gonna get the book?

41:39.356 --> 41:41.623
No, um, no.

41:41.625 --> 41:42.924
I'll come back and grab it
later.

41:42.926 --> 41:43.858
Oh.

42:03.146 --> 42:06.147
Let's try some...

42:11.755 --> 42:12.687
Excuse me, what?

42:14.290 --> 42:15.790
Oh, really?

42:17.894 --> 42:18.993
Hold on a second.

42:23.199 --> 42:24.132
Mm.

42:29.372 --> 42:30.304
Oh yeah.

42:36.146 --> 42:37.345
And you.

42:37.347 --> 42:39.147
Tell me about you.

42:39.149 --> 42:41.349
What about your parents, they
from here?

42:45.088 --> 42:47.255
Sorry, I didn't mean to
bring up a sore subject.

42:56.032 --> 42:59.434
My parents were killed in a
car wreck

43:01.004 --> 43:03.204
after I got out of school.

43:04.708 --> 43:05.440
Jesus.

43:06.376 --> 43:08.076
I'm so sorry.

43:08.078 --> 43:09.410
That's horrible.

43:15.952 --> 43:17.018
It's okay.

43:18.054 --> 43:19.787
How could you know?

43:24.794 --> 43:26.894
My dad was a pastor.

43:28.098 --> 43:30.331
And my mom was a housewife.

43:33.002 --> 43:36.170
And they were out on one
of their few dinner dates.

43:40.410 --> 43:43.277
And a drunk driver ran into
them.

43:48.485 --> 43:50.084
Killed instantly.

43:55.992 --> 43:57.574
I'm sorry.

43:57.576 --> 43:59.159
I'm sorry, you don't wanna hear
this.

44:01.898 --> 44:03.464
Actually, I do.

44:12.842 --> 44:14.909
I better get going.

44:14.911 --> 44:16.878
You aren't gonna finish your
wine?

44:16.880 --> 44:19.781
No, no, I think I've had
enough.

44:19.783 --> 44:22.483
Um, I've stayed longer than I
expected to

44:22.485 --> 44:26.521
and I have an appointment
I'm gonna be late for so

44:26.523 --> 44:27.789
if you'll excuse me.

44:27.791 --> 44:28.556
I understand.

44:29.425 --> 44:31.025
No no no no, I've got it.

44:33.196 --> 44:34.828
Oh I can't let you do that.

44:34.830 --> 44:36.463
No no no no, it's not a
problem.

44:37.567 --> 44:39.033
You can get the next one.

44:42.505 --> 44:44.105
Okay.

44:44.107 --> 44:46.073
I got the next one.

44:46.075 --> 44:47.275
Great, it's a date.

44:48.845 --> 44:52.313
Um, I guess I'll see you
around.

44:54.017 --> 44:56.384
I'll stop by the hotel
sometime.

44:56.386 --> 44:58.219
I go there with friends and hang
out.

44:58.221 --> 44:59.520
Cool, that sounds great.

44:59.522 --> 45:01.823
Um, see ya later.

45:17.307 --> 45:20.308
So you're a Jesus
freak.

45:25.615 --> 45:28.015
I understand.

45:28.017 --> 45:29.083
It's a date.

45:45.401 --> 45:46.267
Marvin?

45:46.269 --> 45:47.401
You in there?

46:15.565 --> 46:17.632
What do you got there?

46:19.135 --> 46:20.301
My daughter.

46:21.137 --> 46:22.069
Oh.

46:23.940 --> 46:25.539
- That's your girl?
- Yeah.

46:28.177 --> 46:30.678
What's she like 25, 22?

46:30.680 --> 46:33.681
She's like that right
now but there she was about

46:35.618 --> 46:37.285
probably 10 or 11.

46:46.296 --> 46:49.130
You really love her, don't
you?

46:53.569 --> 46:55.303
I haven't seen her, I haven't
seen her.

46:55.305 --> 47:00.007
You know, I had a
little girl myself and...

47:05.648 --> 47:06.580
It was an accident.

47:06.582 --> 47:07.514
When's the last time you
saw her?

47:07.516 --> 47:08.449
It was a fuckin' accident.

47:11.020 --> 47:12.053
I dunno, few years.

47:13.523 --> 47:15.056
Who's counting?

47:15.058 --> 47:16.691
I'm counting, I'm asking
you,

47:16.693 --> 47:18.659
when was the last time you saw
her?

47:18.661 --> 47:20.194
I think like three years.

47:21.164 --> 47:22.296
Okay.

48:29.532 --> 48:30.831
Hello, you have
reached

48:30.833 --> 48:32.132
Morris Property Management.

48:32.134 --> 48:33.434
We will be out of town for
a much-needed vacation.

48:33.436 --> 48:38.506
If this is concerning an
apartment you can call 555-7538

48:38.508 --> 48:41.175
or leave a message, thank you.

48:43.813 --> 48:44.779
Fuck you!

49:00.396 --> 49:01.695
So, um...

49:03.499 --> 49:04.632
Guess who I saw today?

49:13.109 --> 49:15.076
I'm wondering, did you guys
split up?

49:17.413 --> 49:20.114
'Cause she was with this guy

49:21.417 --> 49:22.817
and, um,

49:24.654 --> 49:27.121
let's just say that they weren't
acting

49:27.123 --> 49:29.123
like they were just friends, you
know?

49:29.792 --> 49:31.425
If you know what I mean.

50:00.523 --> 50:02.323
Um, black coffee with room,
please.

50:12.401 --> 50:13.868
That'll be 2.37.

50:18.174 --> 50:20.574
- There you go.
- Thanks.

50:24.514 --> 50:26.347
May I sit?

50:27.483 --> 50:29.316
Sure.

50:42.932 --> 50:44.598
I'm sorry

50:44.600 --> 50:45.933
about the way I acted the other
night.

50:45.935 --> 50:48.736
- No, don't be.
- Yes, it was completely

50:48.738 --> 50:52.439
inappropriate of me to
lash out at you like that.

50:53.776 --> 50:55.309
And I apologize.

50:59.248 --> 51:00.214
I have somewhat of a temper

51:00.216 --> 51:01.782
especially when I drink and

51:03.586 --> 51:04.718
I think the whole wedding thing

51:04.720 --> 51:06.420
was stressing me out a little
bit.

51:06.422 --> 51:07.288
It's okay.

51:07.290 --> 51:08.889
No, it's not okay.

51:11.661 --> 51:13.627
I thought about us all week.

51:19.202 --> 51:20.734
I don't wanna lose you.

51:23.839 --> 51:25.739
And I'd like to try to make it
work

51:25.741 --> 51:27.241
if you still wanna try.

51:27.944 --> 51:29.577
Of course I wanna try.

51:31.280 --> 51:34.715
I love that you are passionate.

51:34.717 --> 51:37.751
And that you lose your temper
sometimes.

51:38.988 --> 51:40.588
It's who you are.

51:43.859 --> 51:47.895
So should we go ahead with the
wedding?

51:49.498 --> 51:50.431
Of course.

51:51.734 --> 51:52.633
Well thank you.

51:55.070 --> 51:57.504
I mean I've waited six
months to get into your pants.

51:57.506 --> 51:59.673
You really think I'm gonna bail
now?

52:01.777 --> 52:02.710
I love you.

52:06.231 --> 52:07.914
And our wedding night's gonna
be one night we never forget.

52:09.352 --> 52:12.653
- I can't wait.
- Me either.

52:12.655 --> 52:14.855
I'm gonna fuck your fucking
brains out.

52:17.293 --> 52:18.359
Okay well...

52:19.762 --> 52:22.363
I'm gonna go on Thursday.

52:22.365 --> 52:24.932
I'll go home, help my
mom get everything ready.

52:24.934 --> 52:28.335
There's so much to do I
still have to get my dress

52:28.337 --> 52:30.638
and pick out a cake and
I dunno just make sure

52:30.640 --> 52:31.939
that everything's perfect.

52:33.976 --> 52:36.744
But I'll call you and see how
things are coming on your end.

52:36.746 --> 52:39.062
Okay.

52:39.064 --> 52:41.381
Remember to get your suit,
don't forget the rings.

52:41.384 --> 52:43.784
Don't worry, I'll remember the
rings.

52:43.786 --> 52:44.685
And my suit.

52:44.687 --> 52:45.619
Yes.

52:46.656 --> 52:47.588
Okay.

52:49.792 --> 52:52.526
- I'll stop by later then.
- Okay.

52:54.563 --> 52:55.929
- I love you.
- I love you too.

52:59.935 --> 53:01.068
Okay, okay.

53:03.939 --> 53:05.539
Bye.

53:34.603 --> 53:36.804
- Hello.
- Hey.

53:36.806 --> 53:38.939
Marvin, how are you?

53:40.443 --> 53:41.475
I'm doing fine.

53:43.112 --> 53:44.044
You?

53:44.880 --> 53:45.879
- Trent?
- Hey.

53:48.718 --> 53:49.783
Well I'm great.

53:49.785 --> 53:51.852
I sold a picture yesterday.

53:51.854 --> 53:53.821
Oh that's great,
congratulations.

53:54.824 --> 53:56.523
High five.

53:56.525 --> 53:57.958
Trent and I are celebrating.

53:57.960 --> 53:59.026
You wanna join us?

53:59.028 --> 54:00.561
There's beer in the fridge.

54:01.564 --> 54:02.896
Sure.

54:02.898 --> 54:04.798
I don't mind if I do.

54:32.895 --> 54:35.929
- So you sold a picture.
- Mm hmm.

54:35.931 --> 54:37.898
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

54:45.574 --> 54:47.875
Trent, do you have something
for this?

54:47.877 --> 54:49.910
I don't wanna get any ashes on
the floor.

54:54.016 --> 54:56.683
So packing, where are you going?

54:56.685 --> 54:58.419
I'm leaving tomorrow.

54:58.421 --> 55:00.554
I'm sorry, I thought Trent told
you this.

55:00.556 --> 55:01.955
Thank you.

55:01.957 --> 55:03.023
You don't have
to apologize to him,

55:03.025 --> 55:04.091
it's none of his business.

55:04.093 --> 55:05.092
Oh Trent.

55:07.596 --> 55:09.663
Uh, it's okay.

55:11.434 --> 55:13.033
So what are you guys, where are
you going

55:13.035 --> 55:14.067
for your honeymoon?

55:15.805 --> 55:16.904
Costa Rica.

55:16.906 --> 55:20.607
Wow, that's great, I love
Costa Rica.

55:20.609 --> 55:22.142
Where, what city?

55:22.144 --> 55:25.179
Mm, we're gonna go all over.

55:28.083 --> 55:30.951
I wanna use this as a
way to get new material

55:30.953 --> 55:33.086
for the show I'm doing when I
get back.

55:33.923 --> 55:36.156
I lived there in the '70s.

55:36.158 --> 55:37.191
It was amazing.

55:40.863 --> 55:42.930
That was quite a while back.

55:42.932 --> 55:44.898
It's amazing how time flies.

55:51.140 --> 55:52.206
Big storm coming.

55:53.909 --> 55:56.009
Hold on just a second, I
wanna get you something.

56:03.185 --> 56:04.852
Okay, what's wrong with you?

56:04.854 --> 56:07.154
Why are you acting so strange?

56:08.891 --> 56:10.257
He's not acting normal.

56:11.193 --> 56:12.826
What does that mean?

56:12.828 --> 56:13.760
I don't know.

56:14.864 --> 56:16.630
He's not usually this polite.

56:16.632 --> 56:17.931
He usually is with me.

56:17.933 --> 56:19.233
Maybe you get on his nerves or
something.

56:19.235 --> 56:21.068
Oh I get on his nerves?

56:21.070 --> 56:22.836
He's living in my fucking
apartment!

56:22.838 --> 56:23.770
Okay.

56:25.741 --> 56:28.509
I found this stone in Costa
Rica.

56:29.612 --> 56:32.746
I don't remember exactly where.

56:32.748 --> 56:34.515
I was traveling up the coast.

56:35.818 --> 56:37.251
Surfing and camping out.

56:39.054 --> 56:41.622
Hiding out, really.

56:41.624 --> 56:43.757
I was in this really bad spot in
my life.

56:46.161 --> 56:48.562
I had just lost my wife
and in some sense I guess

56:48.564 --> 56:49.963
I was trying to kill myself.

56:49.965 --> 56:54.668
Anyway, yeah well I had a
geologist friend of mine

56:55.638 --> 56:56.670
check it out.

56:58.274 --> 56:59.239
He told me

57:01.544 --> 57:03.644
that there's only one place in
the world

57:05.748 --> 57:07.314
that has stone of that nature.

57:18.160 --> 57:19.092
Ethiopia.

57:28.137 --> 57:31.572
So, so what's the point?

57:32.808 --> 57:35.042
Why are you telling us all this?

57:35.044 --> 57:37.244
Well the point is I'm
giving it to Jackie.

57:39.114 --> 57:40.047
Why?

57:40.049 --> 57:43.784
Well that stone has given
me a lot of good luck.

57:43.786 --> 57:45.185
And it's time to pass it on.

57:45.187 --> 57:51.325
And you, you know, you
remind me of my wife.

57:53.162 --> 57:55.062
That same zest for life.

57:56.065 --> 57:57.731
That same spark.

58:01.770 --> 58:05.973
Oh god that's really
sweet but I can't take it.

58:05.975 --> 58:07.374
It's your lucky stone.

58:07.376 --> 58:09.743
Oh no, you have no choice.

58:09.745 --> 58:11.111
It's my wedding gift to you.

58:13.616 --> 58:14.681
Wow, that's...

58:16.085 --> 58:18.819
That's the sweetest gift
anyone has ever given me.

58:26.829 --> 58:28.778
So sweet.

58:28.780 --> 58:30.730
Now if you will excuse me,
I have to use the restroom.

58:31.400 --> 58:33.700
Be careful, be careful.

58:42.378 --> 58:44.277
You're so fuckin' full of
shit.

58:46.248 --> 58:48.415
I might be but I'm never gonna
tell you.

59:05.100 --> 59:06.333
Can I have another drink
please?

59:06.335 --> 59:08.001
Sure, coming right up.

59:19.715 --> 59:23.450
You're doing, you know,
you're doing the best.

59:23.452 --> 59:26.453
You're only trying to do your
best.

59:29.058 --> 59:32.993
I miss my daughter,
I miss my little girl.

59:32.995 --> 59:34.461
I miss my little girl so much.

59:37.466 --> 59:40.967
I guess I didn't really know,
you know...

59:41.837 --> 59:42.769
Hey come here.

59:46.709 --> 59:49.876
I got nothing left, I got
nothing left, I got nothing left

59:49.878 --> 59:53.246
here, it's all gone, it's
all gone, I got nothing left,

59:53.248 --> 59:55.382
I got nothing left, okay.

59:55.384 --> 01:00:00.120
She's gone, she got run over,
I got nothing left, okay.

01:00:00.122 --> 01:00:01.054
Oh fuck.

01:00:02.091 --> 01:00:04.891
It's okay Joe, it's okay god
damnit.

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.060
Can't even get that fucking
asshole a wedding gift.

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:08.995
- Listen to me.
- What?

01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:12.299
I knew you'd find out.

01:00:17.005 --> 01:00:18.254
I know.

01:00:18.256 --> 01:00:19.506
I told you, remember, I said
that,

01:00:19.508 --> 01:00:22.075
he still knows what I said.

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:27.013
You get one little fuckin'
inkling of anything,

01:00:27.015 --> 01:00:28.448
I'll back you up.

01:00:29.885 --> 01:00:30.951
I mean that.

01:00:33.455 --> 01:00:35.222
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

01:00:35.224 --> 01:00:36.823
- Hear me?
- Yeah.

01:00:38.393 --> 01:00:41.194
That still goes, never change.

01:00:44.533 --> 01:00:46.199
Can I get one more beer?

01:00:46.201 --> 01:00:47.134
Yeah.

01:02:33.642 --> 01:02:35.342
You dirty bastard.

01:02:43.285 --> 01:02:44.451
Shit, fuck!

01:02:53.996 --> 01:02:54.928
Oh shit!

01:03:03.538 --> 01:03:05.405
Well I bet you that looked
stupid.

01:03:10.946 --> 01:03:11.678
Oh my.

01:03:22.691 --> 01:03:23.924
Come on, baby.

01:03:23.926 --> 01:03:25.625
Come on, baby.

01:03:25.627 --> 01:03:26.693
Come on, oh!

01:05:01.456 --> 01:05:03.089
Hey are you a fag or what?

01:05:03.091 --> 01:05:04.424
What?

01:05:04.426 --> 01:05:05.492
You heard me.

01:05:09.731 --> 01:05:11.398
Trent.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.099
You got a great lady there.

01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:16.069
I wish I was 30 years younger.

01:05:18.774 --> 01:05:20.206
You need to take care of her.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.309
- I plan...
- No!

01:05:23.311 --> 01:05:26.079
I don't fucking care, you don't,
do you!

01:05:26.081 --> 01:05:27.247
Huh?

01:05:27.249 --> 01:05:28.515
You're not, are you?

01:05:28.517 --> 01:05:31.418
I mean what in the fuck
you letting this asshole

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.119
steal your girl for?

01:05:33.121 --> 01:05:35.155
I'm sick of hearing about
this!

01:05:35.157 --> 01:05:37.323
It's none of your business,
you're just a fucking drunk!

01:05:37.325 --> 01:05:38.458
Yeah well I might be a fucking
drunk

01:05:39.527 --> 01:05:40.593
but at least I'm honest about
it.

01:05:40.595 --> 01:05:41.461
Huh?

01:05:41.463 --> 01:05:42.796
What are you?

01:05:42.798 --> 01:05:43.763
Lying cocksucker!

01:05:43.765 --> 01:05:48.468
Your whole fucking life is a
fucking lie and you know it!

01:05:49.638 --> 01:05:51.337
I know who you are!

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.989
You don't fool me.

01:05:53.991 --> 01:05:55.841
You might fool everybody
else but you don't fool me!

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:37.817
36 years.

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:49.229
Mm, mm.

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:27.800
Wow.

01:07:27.802 --> 01:07:29.169
Place is really clean.

01:07:30.438 --> 01:07:31.371
Thank you.

01:07:32.174 --> 01:07:32.906
No problem.

01:07:37.245 --> 01:07:39.846
Jackie called and she
wanted me to tell you

01:07:39.848 --> 01:07:42.782
that she's gonna call you
sometime tomorrow morning.

01:07:42.784 --> 01:07:44.450
Alright, thanks.

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:49.255
I'm gonna go soak in the
tub, I'm chilled to the bone.

01:08:12.847 --> 01:08:13.780
Hey Trent.

01:08:16.785 --> 01:08:17.850
You look cleaner.

01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:44.944
McNoughten, nice.

01:08:46.881 --> 01:08:48.363
So what are you celebrating,

01:08:48.365 --> 01:08:49.848
you finally found a home that'd
take you?

01:08:51.286 --> 01:08:52.585
That was a good one.

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:55.421
Yeah, yeah, grab a
glass and I'll tell you.

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:57.390
Oh no no, that's
alright.

01:08:57.392 --> 01:08:58.390
Oh come on.

01:08:58.393 --> 01:09:01.661
What's the matter wise-ass,
you don't like scotch?

01:09:02.731 --> 01:09:04.764
Actually, I really enjoy
scotch.

01:09:04.765 --> 01:09:06.532
Well then grab a glass.

01:09:06.533 --> 01:09:07.567
We're celebrating.

01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:09.868
Okay.

01:09:34.496 --> 01:09:36.929
I wanna apologize for
the way I've treated you.

01:09:37.932 --> 01:09:38.997
Cheers.

01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:46.072
November 12, 1972.

01:09:46.073 --> 01:09:48.390
- Okay.
- Ah.

01:09:48.392 --> 01:09:50.709
So what's that,
the end of the Vietnam War?

01:09:50.712 --> 01:09:54.380
No, that's the day I killed my
wife.

01:09:55.984 --> 01:09:57.383
You killed your wife?

01:09:59.421 --> 01:10:01.654
In a manner of speaking, yeah.

01:10:01.656 --> 01:10:03.890
I was drunk and high and
ran the car off the road.

01:10:05.527 --> 01:10:07.760
She was thrown from it
and killed instantly.

01:10:10.365 --> 01:10:11.097
Jesus.

01:10:12.901 --> 01:10:13.833
How horrible.

01:10:15.637 --> 01:10:16.569
It was.

01:10:19.107 --> 01:10:22.508
She was a perfect light.

01:10:24.446 --> 01:10:26.079
I've never found another like
her.

01:10:31.486 --> 01:10:35.755
Mr. Morris mentioned that
you were his father in law

01:10:35.757 --> 01:10:39.625
so that would mean that
you have a daughter.

01:10:39.627 --> 01:10:40.560
Yeah, Katie.

01:10:42.063 --> 01:10:43.930
She was with the sitter that
night.

01:10:46.668 --> 01:10:48.534
And you and her don't
get along?

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:49.469
Not really.

01:10:52.474 --> 01:10:53.806
After Abby died,

01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:58.878
I went into this really,
really dark place.

01:11:00.982 --> 01:11:03.082
And I wasn't fit to be a father
and

01:11:06.421 --> 01:11:07.754
I put her up for adoption.

01:11:11.025 --> 01:11:12.024
She was 10.

01:11:14.028 --> 01:11:18.064
We got together a couple
years ago, we reunited

01:11:18.066 --> 01:11:21.401
and she still hasn't forgiven
me for abandoning her

01:11:21.403 --> 01:11:22.802
and killing her mother

01:11:22.804 --> 01:11:24.771
and I can't say that I blame
her.

01:11:26.775 --> 01:11:29.909
That's a pretty awful thing
to go through at 10 years old.

01:11:31.079 --> 01:11:33.446
Horrible thing to go through
at any age.

01:11:34.115 --> 01:11:35.081
Yeah you're right.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:41.654
Jackie reminds me a lot of Abby.

01:11:41.656 --> 01:11:45.558
She's got that same
zest for life, you know?

01:11:49.063 --> 01:11:53.566
So every year since 1972

01:11:53.568 --> 01:11:56.702
you drink a bottle of
scotch in her memory?

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:01.090
Yeah.

01:12:01.092 --> 01:12:03.743
But, you know, I'm almost
always with somebody else,

01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:06.012
and this year it's you.

01:12:11.486 --> 01:12:12.985
Cheers.

01:12:14.538 --> 01:12:16.088
- To new wives.
- And lost loves.

01:12:23.231 --> 01:12:24.797
So there's this old maid.

01:12:25.767 --> 01:12:27.800
She wants to travel by bus

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:30.703
to the pet cemetery with
the remains of her cat.

01:12:30.705 --> 01:12:34.240
She gets up on the bus and
she says to the driver,

01:12:34.242 --> 01:12:36.509
"I've got a dead pussy."

01:12:36.511 --> 01:12:39.178
The driver looks at her,
points to the seat behind him

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.914
and says, "Why don't you
sit down there with my wife,

01:12:41.916 --> 01:12:43.583
"you got a lot in common."

01:12:45.854 --> 01:12:46.786
So.

01:12:54.062 --> 01:12:56.128
Come on, get up.

01:12:56.130 --> 01:12:58.798
Okay, like this, right at the
end, right?

01:12:58.800 --> 01:12:59.866
Then.

01:13:16.284 --> 01:13:19.018
Yeah, yeah I got my bag
of tricks right here.

01:13:22.557 --> 01:13:24.690
No no no, I don't know any.

01:13:24.692 --> 01:13:27.960
Oh come on, you gotta know
one.

01:13:27.962 --> 01:13:29.662
No, I mean I really
don't.

01:13:29.664 --> 01:13:33.599
Oh, don't be such a pussy,
come on.

01:13:33.601 --> 01:13:34.534
Okay.

01:13:35.737 --> 01:13:37.136
It's not very good.

01:13:37.138 --> 01:13:38.571
I don't care, just tell me a
joke.

01:13:38.573 --> 01:13:40.039
- Okay.
- Alright.

01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:45.912
So the pope is making
his way down the line

01:13:45.914 --> 01:13:48.114
and he stops and he
leans over and he says,

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:55.254
"I told you yesterday to
get the fuck outta here."

01:13:57.792 --> 01:13:58.824
Not that.

01:13:58.826 --> 01:13:59.692
- Oh yeah.
- With all them

01:13:59.694 --> 01:14:01.027
boyos coming up.

01:14:09.837 --> 01:14:10.770
Whoa.

01:14:15.743 --> 01:14:18.010
Whoa, holy shit.

01:14:18.012 --> 01:14:22.214
I gotta go to bed, I gotta go
to bed, class in the morning.

01:14:22.216 --> 01:14:25.117
Hey, I had a good time tonight.

01:14:25.119 --> 01:14:26.184
Thanks man.

01:14:26.186 --> 01:14:27.252
Hey, you're welcome.

01:14:27.255 --> 01:14:28.988
You're a good guy, Trent.

01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:31.057
- Yeah.
- You're alright.

01:14:43.871 --> 01:14:45.738
What would it hurt?

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:46.672
Who would know?

01:14:49.344 --> 01:14:52.845
I could keep her
tuned up.

01:14:52.847 --> 01:14:54.680
This one taken?

01:14:54.682 --> 01:14:55.348
You're never gonna get
married.

01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:28.981
What the fuck?

01:15:31.285 --> 01:15:32.685
What the fuck?

01:15:32.687 --> 01:15:33.919
I'm sorry.

01:15:33.921 --> 01:15:35.154
Trent, what the fuck
are you doing in my bed?

01:15:35.156 --> 01:15:37.390
I'm sorry, it was an accident.

01:15:37.392 --> 01:15:42.194
I'm sorry, it was an accident.

01:15:42.196 --> 01:15:44.764
What do you mean it was an
accident, you fuckin' fag?

01:15:44.766 --> 01:15:46.064
Don't call me that.

01:15:46.066 --> 01:15:47.365
Well then tell me how it was
an accident

01:15:47.368 --> 01:15:48.800
you were in my bed.

01:15:48.802 --> 01:15:50.235
I have these dreams
sometimes and I just wake up...

01:15:50.238 --> 01:15:51.170
Dreams?

01:15:52.807 --> 01:15:54.407
You twisted fuck.

01:15:54.409 --> 01:15:56.042
You were jacking off.

01:15:56.044 --> 01:15:57.710
No, no, it's not like that.

01:15:57.712 --> 01:15:58.911
You were jacking off in my
bed.

01:15:58.913 --> 01:15:59.979
No, no!

01:15:59.981 --> 01:16:01.446
No that's not it.

01:16:01.448 --> 01:16:02.914
No, you were jacking off,
weren't you?

01:16:02.917 --> 01:16:05.751
You're a sick queer-ass
motherfucker

01:16:05.753 --> 01:16:07.719
and I knew it all along I knew
that

01:16:07.721 --> 01:16:09.688
the only way you could be with
her and not be fuckin' her

01:16:09.691 --> 01:16:11.724
is if you were a fag.

01:16:11.726 --> 01:16:13.125
Right?

01:16:13.127 --> 01:16:14.727
Huh?

01:16:14.729 --> 01:16:16.395
Don't call me that, I'm not a
fag.

01:16:16.397 --> 01:16:18.464
Yeah you are, you're
a fag, you're a fag.

01:16:18.466 --> 01:16:20.966
I'm gonna beat your
fuckin' little faggot ass

01:16:20.968 --> 01:16:22.234
and then I'm gonna call
your girl and tell her

01:16:22.236 --> 01:16:24.737
you were beating it in my bed,
okay?

01:16:24.739 --> 01:16:26.138
What do you think she's
gonna think of that, huh?

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.374
What do you think?

01:16:28.376 --> 01:16:30.943
Ah, forget that, I'm not
gonna have to beat you.

01:16:30.945 --> 01:16:32.144
I'm gonna tell Jackie

01:16:33.181 --> 01:16:35.448
that you were jacking off in my
bed

01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:37.016
while I was asleep.

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.787
I'm sure she's gonna wanna know
why.

01:16:45.059 --> 01:16:47.392
You motherfucker!

01:16:47.394 --> 01:16:49.728
Son of a bitch, I'm
gonna fucking kill you!

01:16:50.965 --> 01:16:56.035
Fuck!

01:16:59.373 --> 01:17:01.006
Shut up!

01:17:01.008 --> 01:17:02.775
You motherfucker!

01:17:02.777 --> 01:17:05.244
You never fucking use an
ashtray!

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:08.114
You never fucking clean up after
yourself!

01:17:08.116 --> 01:17:12.051
You never fucking flush
the fucking toilet!

01:17:13.221 --> 01:17:15.488
Why can't you just be nice?

01:17:46.554 --> 01:17:48.821
Oh Jesus, what did I do?

01:17:52.493 --> 01:17:53.425
Oh my god.

01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:10.456
Hi honey.

01:21:11.292 --> 01:21:13.092
I know you're there.

01:21:13.094 --> 01:21:14.693
Did you take the rings?

01:21:14.695 --> 01:21:18.297
I'm taking the plane, see
you tomorrow, I'm so excited.

01:21:18.299 --> 01:21:19.298
So excited.

01:21:22.603 --> 01:21:26.672
Hey, honey, I haven't
received any answer from you.

01:21:28.476 --> 01:21:29.575
What's wrong?

01:21:29.577 --> 01:21:30.509
Call me.

01:22:03.143 --> 01:22:05.644
Trent, I've called you for
four days and I have no answer.

01:22:05.646 --> 01:22:08.113
Are you regretting about the
wedding?

01:22:08.783 --> 01:22:10.482
What's going on?

01:22:10.484 --> 01:22:11.383
Call me.

01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:35.607
I'm on my way home so we need to
talk.

01:22:41.382 --> 01:22:42.847
You know what the best thing

01:22:42.849 --> 01:22:44.315
about fucking 25 year olds is?

01:22:47.188 --> 01:22:48.587
No, I don't know.

01:22:51.725 --> 01:22:53.625
There's 20 of 'em.

01:22:53.627 --> 01:22:55.227
Trent?

01:22:57.298 --> 01:23:01.800
Trent.

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:10.175
I just wanna talk to you.

01:23:11.645 --> 01:23:13.445
Trent, you in there?

01:23:14.682 --> 01:23:17.716
Baby, I just wanna hear your
voice.

01:23:17.718 --> 01:23:21.120
I don't know why you won't talk
to me.

01:23:21.122 --> 01:23:21.854
Trent.

01:23:23.724 --> 01:23:24.656
Trent!

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:32.865
Trent,
this is Detective Callahan.

01:23:32.867 --> 01:23:34.700
Listen, I just need to
talk to you for a minute

01:23:34.702 --> 01:23:37.402
so if you could open the
door, that would be great.

01:23:52.486 --> 01:23:54.520
Trent, we know you're in there,

01:23:54.522 --> 01:23:57.256
you just looked out the window.

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:01.859
Gonna have to go in.

01:24:01.861 --> 01:24:03.861
Okay, we need to get everyone
out of here.

01:24:03.864 --> 01:24:04.730
Trent.

01:24:06.255 --> 01:24:07.776
- Trent, open.
- Come on, come on.

01:24:07.778 --> 01:24:09.300
Trent, pick up, no,
no!

01:24:09.303 --> 01:24:11.236
Trent, open up, Trent!

01:24:11.238 --> 01:24:14.740
No, no, get your fucking hands
off of me!

01:24:14.742 --> 01:24:16.241
Let us do our
job, let us do our job.

01:24:17.394 --> 01:24:18.544
- I am.
- We're doing our jobs.

01:24:18.546 --> 01:24:19.611
- No!
- Come on.

01:24:19.613 --> 01:24:21.346
We're gonna go this way, come
on.

01:24:21.348 --> 01:24:23.849
Unit two, 219.

01:24:23.851 --> 01:24:26.685
Transport is on the way.

01:24:38.232 --> 01:24:40.832
Officers on the scene.

01:24:40.834 --> 01:24:42.234
Police, open up!

01:24:53.948 --> 01:24:54.880
Goodbye.

01:25:06.522 --> 01:25:11.522
