being a great little
place to get away

09:22.879 --> 09:24.637
and just enjoy
the quiet

09:24.714 --> 09:26.681
and just focus
on friends

09:26.758 --> 09:29.809
and-and enjoy one another
and maybe some fussing

09:29.886 --> 09:32.186
because that's
what we do, is fuss.

09:32.263 --> 09:35.189
- Just remember when
you get back, and we go in,

09:35.266 --> 09:36.691
and, uh, the week after,
we're shootin'

09:36.768 --> 09:38.693
the music video,
both of 'em.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.403
- Oh, my God.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.697
- You can relax
for a few days,

09:42.774 --> 09:45.867
and then you come back,
and it's back to work.

09:45.943 --> 09:47.252
- Having Chris
as my husbanger

09:47.329 --> 09:49.087
is definitely
a blessing.

09:49.164 --> 09:51.247
I'm shooting a pilot.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.384
Hey, we doin' okay?

09:58.006 --> 09:59.413
All right.

09:59.491 --> 10:02.884
But it's exhausting dealing
with someone who you love

10:02.960 --> 10:05.053
and who loves you
who also, you know,

10:05.129 --> 10:08.222
is in coachy,
managery mode.

10:08.299 --> 10:10.775
- So, what about Ashley?

10:10.852 --> 10:12.944
- I don't know if she's
gonna be leaving the house,

10:13.021 --> 10:14.446
'cause she had the baby.

10:14.522 --> 10:16.781
- I-I would extend
the invitation.

10:16.858 --> 10:19.359
- Hmm.
- You should call her.

10:19.435 --> 10:22.278
- I should call her?
- Yeah, just to say hey.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.456
- Oh, you're so nice.

10:24.532 --> 10:30.745
♪♪

10:30.822 --> 10:31.871
- Time to wake up.

10:31.948 --> 10:35.041
Time to wake up, Dyl.

10:35.118 --> 10:37.802
Okay, Dylan, time
to wake up, baba.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.589
Hello.
- Hi!

10:41.666 --> 10:44.926
- How are you?
- I'm so excited to see you.

10:45.002 --> 10:47.470
Oh, here you go.
- Yes.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.481
- Look at this place.
- I know.

10:49.557 --> 10:51.307
We're kind of being
overtaken with toys.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.060
- Wait, wait, I didn't know
he was sitting there.

10:54.137 --> 10:55.987
- This is Dylan.
- Oh, my gosh.

10:56.064 --> 10:57.230
- Yeah.

10:57.306 --> 11:01.660
- Oh, Ashley, he's,
like, perfect.

11:01.736 --> 11:03.161
- He is.
- I wanna say

11:03.238 --> 11:04.737
he doesn't look
like Dean, right?

11:04.814 --> 11:06.164
- Not at all.
- Right.

11:06.241 --> 11:08.241
- Yeah, it's a little crazy
how different they look.

11:08.317 --> 11:10.502
- Aww, I love him.
- Yeah.

11:10.578 --> 11:11.503
Thank you, babes.

11:11.579 --> 11:15.123
- Dylan is a little
love muffin,

11:15.199 --> 11:17.583
and I just wanna
put my face in his face.

11:17.660 --> 11:21.254
I know I can't, and I won't,
germs, but I want to.

11:21.330 --> 11:23.348
- I'm navigating it,
you know, everything,

11:23.425 --> 11:24.498
and I know,
you know,

11:24.576 --> 11:26.676
your daughters
are three years apart.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.803
- Grace is 18 months
older than the twins.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.263
- No!

11:30.339 --> 11:31.764
- So, imagine you bringing
home two of those right now.

11:31.841 --> 11:32.932
- No, I couldn't.
- No.

11:33.009 --> 11:34.267
- I couldn't fathom it.

11:34.343 --> 11:36.102
- Okay, so, how are you,
like, navigating all this?

11:36.179 --> 11:38.029
- Yeah, I'm doing okay.
- Uh-huh.

11:38.106 --> 11:39.272
- I'm so tired.

11:39.348 --> 11:41.533
So, Dean is just--
he loves the baby, right?

11:41.609 --> 11:42.775
- Okay.
- He wants to rub him,

11:42.852 --> 11:45.370
pat his head, but when
it's time to play,

11:45.447 --> 11:46.988
he's just
doing his own thing, he--

11:47.064 --> 11:49.532
- No way.
- Did Grace experience it?

11:49.543 --> 11:50.600
- Grace was mad.

11:50.602 --> 11:51.451
Grace was mad for,
like, a while.

11:51.527 --> 11:52.618
She cried for,
like, two weeks,

11:52.695 --> 11:55.121
and then she was mad for,
like, 'til today.

11:55.198 --> 11:57.048
[laughing]

11:57.125 --> 11:59.459
So, we did miss you
the other day.

11:59.535 --> 12:01.294
Now, do you know
why we got together?

12:01.370 --> 12:03.171
- N-No.
So, what-- what--

12:03.247 --> 12:05.890
- What in the world?
- Hi.

12:05.967 --> 12:08.634
- Is that a Dean?
- Come say hi.

12:08.711 --> 12:10.845
Come to your brother.
- Hi, Dean.

12:10.922 --> 12:14.140
- Hi, baby,
how you doin'?

12:14.217 --> 12:15.808
Did you have
a good day at school?

12:15.885 --> 12:17.569
- How are you?
- Good.

12:19.055 --> 12:19.979
- Very nice to meet you.

12:20.056 --> 12:21.314
- Oh, my goodness,
okay, so, yes.

12:21.390 --> 12:23.191
- Yes.
- You guys got together for?

12:23.267 --> 12:27.153
- Okay, so Candiace's
house that you called

12:27.230 --> 12:29.080
her mama's house--
- The record reflected.

12:29.157 --> 12:30.156
- Yes.
- Okay.

12:30.233 --> 12:32.200
- It sold.
- Oh, good.

12:32.276 --> 12:33.493
- Yes, and so,
she wanted to have, like,

12:33.569 --> 12:35.828
her last
memories there.

12:35.905 --> 12:38.089
So, she invited us there
to kinda have, like,

12:38.166 --> 12:40.875
a pajama jam.
Then all of a sudden...

12:40.952 --> 12:45.004
[gurgling]

12:45.081 --> 12:47.757
- Oh!
- Oh, sh--.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.759
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.102
I gotta go.

12:51.179 --> 12:52.086
- You want Gizelle to change
your diaper you said?

12:52.163 --> 12:54.096
- Oh, my God-- Nanny?
- Daisy.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.890
- Um, Daisy!
Daisy, we need help!

12:55.967 --> 12:58.610
- My friends should feel
very flattered that

12:58.686 --> 13:01.938
my children welcome them
into their home

13:01.948 --> 13:03.564
by releasing
their bowels.

13:03.641 --> 13:04.690
[gurgling]

13:04.767 --> 13:06.108
Uh-oh.
- Ooh.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.693
[laughing]

13:07.770 --> 13:09.695
- They should take it
as a compliment.

13:09.772 --> 13:11.364
- Aww, he's back,
and he's clean.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.458
- Aww, thank you.
- You got it?

13:13.535 --> 13:16.369
- Yeah-- He gave you
a little gift.

13:16.445 --> 13:18.037
- So, this time, what
happened to the booty hole?

13:18.114 --> 13:19.464
- Things happened
down there

13:19.541 --> 13:20.965
that didn't happen
the first time.

13:21.042 --> 13:22.625
- Oh, did you take a sh--?
- I did.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.920
- I did that, and I was
like, holy sh--,

13:25.997 --> 13:26.921
I'm sh--ting
on these people.

13:26.998 --> 13:28.289
Like, I felt horrible.

13:28.366 --> 13:29.215
- They're, like, wiping
it like it's no big deal.

13:29.292 --> 13:31.050
- Yeah.
It freaked Jamal out.

13:31.127 --> 13:32.385
[laughing]

13:32.461 --> 13:34.136
- Is the real reason
you and Jamal divorced

13:34.147 --> 13:35.388
because he freaked out
when you pooped

13:35.464 --> 13:39.359
during labor?
[laughing]

13:41.178 --> 13:42.303
- He couldn't
handle it.

13:42.380 --> 13:43.771
The man didn't wanna
be with me no more.

13:43.848 --> 13:46.324
[laughing]

13:46.401 --> 13:47.492
Oh, wait a minute.

13:47.569 --> 13:48.642
Then Candiace said
we're going on a trip.

13:48.720 --> 13:49.661
Have you been
invited on this trip?

13:49.737 --> 13:50.720
- No-- Trip?

13:50.722 --> 13:52.831
- Well, okay,
okay, wait, wait.

13:52.907 --> 13:54.407
- Well, a lot-- what
happened at this party?

13:54.483 --> 13:56.909
This was a--
- Okay, so, Candiace,

13:56.986 --> 13:59.954
she said there's so much
to do in Williamsburg,

14:00.031 --> 14:01.497
we should go
to Williamsburg.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.748
- As in Williamsburg,
Virginia?

14:02.825 --> 14:03.991
- As in Virginia.

14:04.069 --> 14:05.343
I know there's nothing
there, but I'm down.

14:05.420 --> 14:06.502
She didn't mention
this to you?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.513
- I have not
talked to Candiace.

14:11.092 --> 14:15.094
- Girl, I forgot
to invite Ashley.

14:15.171 --> 14:17.430
It just
slipped my mind.

14:17.506 --> 14:19.932
My head wrap was
too tight, and, you know,

14:20.009 --> 14:23.862
I just-- I forgot.

14:23.938 --> 14:26.698
- Okay, I'm inviting you
on the trip, right now.

14:26.774 --> 14:28.858
- Oh, when is it?

14:28.869 --> 14:31.110
- Next week.
- Oh.

14:31.187 --> 14:33.613
[laughing]

14:33.689 --> 14:34.539
- So, maybe you can
come for a day.

14:34.616 --> 14:36.115
- Maybe a day.
- Yes.

14:36.192 --> 14:39.043
What was interesting...
- Yeah.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.037
- Was Miss Mia.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.955
- What happened?
Okay, Gizelle.

14:43.032 --> 14:44.665
- So, Mia, like, eases
her way over to me.

14:44.742 --> 14:47.001
- Okay.
- And she's like,

14:47.078 --> 14:48.502
"Well, I mean, I just
wanted you to know,

14:48.579 --> 14:52.006
"like, I'm sorry, and, like,
I just wanna get to

14:52.083 --> 14:53.299
"a better place
with you."

14:53.376 --> 14:55.384
- I think it's important
for us to try to connect.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.053
Can we start over?

14:57.063 --> 14:59.397
- So, me and Robyn are
gonna go out with her.

14:59.474 --> 15:01.807
- So, what do you hope to
get out of it, though?

15:01.884 --> 15:04.810
- I wanna know how you went
from Annapolis, Maryland

15:04.887 --> 15:07.855
to dancing in a strip club
in North Carolina.

15:07.932 --> 15:09.223
- Right.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.483
- Like, 'cause I need this
information, so I can

15:10.559 --> 15:11.859
tell my children this is
what you're not gonna do.

15:11.936 --> 15:14.579
Like, this is what
we're not doing.

15:14.656 --> 15:16.572
- So...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.574
I forgot this part.
- Okay.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.993
- Wen-day.
- Oh, did she show out?

15:21.070 --> 15:22.995
- Okay, Wendy came in
literally in nothing.

15:23.072 --> 15:27.166
Like, she had a trench coat
on, fausses, tee-tas,

15:27.243 --> 15:29.377
a little shorty,
short, short shorts.

15:29.453 --> 15:31.087
- Wendy!
- Hey!

15:31.097 --> 15:34.098
- Oh!
- Hey, hey, hey.

15:34.175 --> 15:37.218
- Yes!
- It was a lot.

15:37.294 --> 15:39.011
It's just not
the Wendy that we met.

15:39.088 --> 15:40.596
It's just-just a new--

15:40.607 --> 15:42.556
I don't wanna say
new and improved.

15:42.633 --> 15:46.018
I wanna say new Wendy
that likes to talk about

15:46.095 --> 15:47.445
her titties
and her ass.

15:47.522 --> 15:48.896
- That, yeah, that is
so contrary to her.

15:48.973 --> 15:49.781
- Yes.

15:49.857 --> 15:51.691
- We met her
as a professor.

15:51.767 --> 15:52.692
- Yeah.

15:52.768 --> 15:53.785
- And now, she's,
like, you know,

15:53.861 --> 15:55.695
Miss Wendy if you're
nasty kinda thing.

15:55.771 --> 15:57.530
- Yes, oh, yes.
That's a good one.

15:57.606 --> 16:01.242
- Yes.
- And there is a rumor out.

16:01.318 --> 16:03.962
It's-- it was very
much like supposedly

16:04.038 --> 16:05.871
Eddie has a girlfriend
or somethin'.

16:05.948 --> 16:14.463
♪♪

16:14.474 --> 16:17.141
It could be that because
she knows the rumor,

16:17.218 --> 16:18.050
she's trying
to overcompensate.

16:18.127 --> 16:20.261
Not that it's true.

16:20.337 --> 16:23.222
You know, I don't like to
really discuss a lotta, um,

16:23.299 --> 16:24.974
nonsense that
the social media

16:24.985 --> 16:28.436
and the Twitter has
to say, but it could be

16:28.512 --> 16:30.488
why Wendy has new titties
and a new booty.

16:30.565 --> 16:33.274
I'm just sayin'.

16:33.350 --> 16:34.233
- Even if those rumor
are out there...

16:34.310 --> 16:35.234
- Yeah.
- She doesn't seem to be

16:35.311 --> 16:36.652
a person who would
succumb to that.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.320
- True-- I wouldn't
think she would care,

16:38.331 --> 16:40.665
but I didn't think
she would, you know,

16:40.742 --> 16:42.166
jump up with
new boobs and a new--

16:42.243 --> 16:44.618
and a new booty.

16:44.695 --> 16:46.579
So, we'll see
how that plays out,

16:46.655 --> 16:48.581

talk to her.

16:48.657 --> 16:50.958
- If anyone were to
bring it to her attention,

feel the least

gonna just be paying

outta your pocket all
the time, are you-- Like...

17:42.419 --> 17:43.511
in the installment
of our course,

17:43.587 --> 17:46.680
policy and politics.
- Shh.

17:46.757 --> 17:48.524
- No, Kam, stay with Daddy.

17:49.260 --> 17:51.069
Lock the door.

17:51.145 --> 17:52.386
Okay.

17:52.463 --> 17:54.313
The way we've been doing
things for many years,

17:54.390 --> 17:57.075
is not producing
the best results.

17:57.151 --> 17:58.359
That is the key.

17:58.435 --> 18:00.361
Happy reading, as always.

18:00.437 --> 18:02.038
Bye.

18:02.898 --> 18:04.698
Hello, loud family.

18:04.775 --> 18:06.367
- How did it go?

18:06.443 --> 18:08.252
- It went well.

18:08.329 --> 18:09.420
I could hear you guys.

18:09.497 --> 18:11.372
You guys were
having fun out here.

18:11.448 --> 18:13.165
Did you wanna watch TV?
- Yeah.

18:13.242 --> 18:15.259
- Yeah, you guys go downstairs,
so I can talk to daddy.

18:15.336 --> 18:16.836
- [indistinct].

18:16.912 --> 18:18.096
[sighs]
- Oh, God,

18:18.172 --> 18:19.255
I'm exhausted, babe.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.765
- Yeah?
- Hmm.

18:20.842 --> 18:22.383
- Well, you look good.

18:22.459 --> 18:24.718
- It's so funny because

18:24.795 --> 18:26.720
I was just lookin' at myself
in this lecture

18:26.797 --> 18:28.681
with my hoop earrings on,

18:28.757 --> 18:29.849
and I had my shirt
like this

18:29.925 --> 18:31.725
before my lecture.
- Oh, wow.

18:31.802 --> 18:34.019
- I always feel like
this struggle of

18:34.096 --> 18:37.273
having to pick
what hat to wear.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.899
- So, you wanna be able
to present a lecture.

18:38.976 --> 18:40.284
- Because this is who I am.

18:40.361 --> 18:41.677
- That's who you are, right.

18:41.679 --> 18:44.238
- I'm a professor,
but I listen to trap music.

18:44.315 --> 18:46.457
I'm a commentator,
but I curse like a sailor.

18:46.534 --> 18:47.774
- Mm-hmm.

18:47.852 --> 18:50.119
- Like, I feel like
the world tries to fit me

18:50.130 --> 18:51.537
into one box.

18:51.614 --> 18:53.080
Like, even with
the candles, right?

18:53.157 --> 18:55.541
Like, what's been holding me
back with the candles, too,

18:55.618 --> 18:56.750
people be like,

18:56.827 --> 18:58.794
"Wait, how do you go
from being

18:58.805 --> 19:01.088
"this person in your career,

19:01.165 --> 19:02.548
"and now you wanna
start candles?"

19:02.625 --> 19:04.642
- Mm-hmm.
- You know what I mean?

19:04.719 --> 19:06.644
- You're taking a lot
onto your plate.

19:06.721 --> 19:07.979
You're not lettin' anything
go off your plate.

19:08.055 --> 19:09.471
- But isn't that
how I've always been?

19:09.482 --> 19:10.723
- That's how you've
always been,

19:10.799 --> 19:13.100
but it comes a time
when you have to stop.

19:13.177 --> 19:15.561
If you are a shell of yourself,
if you are tired,

19:15.638 --> 19:17.771
you can't give me 100%.

19:17.848 --> 19:19.607
You can't give
the kids 100%.

19:19.683 --> 19:21.400
You know what I mean?

19:21.477 --> 19:23.152
You're doing all
these activities.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.079
- I want a cookie.

19:26.741 --> 19:29.625
- So, my question would be,
are you happy there?

19:31.528 --> 19:34.079
- Are you happy?
Are you fulfilled?

19:34.156 --> 19:35.581
- No.

19:35.658 --> 19:39.343
The things I know I may want
to be fulfilled and doin' X,

19:39.420 --> 19:42.180
and it'll come at a cost
to droppin' off Y and Z.

19:42.256 --> 19:44.506
I think you are like,
well, I wanna achieve X,

19:44.517 --> 19:46.133
but I'm gonna take
all y'all with me.

19:46.210 --> 19:48.761
- Eddie and I always
keep it real with each other,

19:48.837 --> 19:52.473
but can I have just
a little bit of grace

19:52.549 --> 19:53.682
because I'm your wife?

19:53.693 --> 19:56.352
Like, stop being
so hard on me.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.528
- What are you doin'?

19:57.605 --> 19:59.480
You know, you got
a handful of candles.

19:59.556 --> 20:01.315
You chose a name.

20:01.392 --> 20:03.817
Is that name that you chose
on your home essentials?

20:03.894 --> 20:05.527
Did you see if that name
was available?

20:05.538 --> 20:07.947
- Oh, so, you have
to, like, register?

20:08.023 --> 20:10.875
- Yes, you have to
register your business.

20:10.952 --> 20:12.710
- Okay.
So, I need to take--

20:12.787 --> 20:14.828
- So, you need to figure
that one out first

20:14.905 --> 20:16.163
because you probably should
have done all this stuff

20:16.240 --> 20:18.958
before you even indulged
in purchasing and--

20:19.034 --> 20:19.959
- First of all, you're--
- I'm just saying, I'm asking.

20:20.035 --> 20:21.110
I'm putting it
very delicately.

20:21.112 --> 20:22.461
- You're asking--
no, you're asking--

20:22.538 --> 20:23.462
you're not being delicate.
- I'm being very delicate.

20:23.539 --> 20:24.871
- You're trying
to come for me.

20:24.949 --> 20:26.724
Okay, so, what are some of
the things that I need?

20:26.801 --> 20:27.967
Okay, okay,okay.
- The business manager is
gonna help you with the budget.

20:28.043 --> 20:29.285
- So, what--
- The mission of your company,

20:29.287 --> 20:30.377
what you're trying to do.
- I need a mission?

20:30.455 --> 20:31.562
- I mean, you formulate
your thoughts.

20:31.639 --> 20:32.972
- Wat? The-- the mission
is to sell candles.

20:33.048 --> 20:34.390
- You need to think about
the business plan,

20:34.400 --> 20:36.734
the financials, how you're
gonna finance it.

20:36.811 --> 20:37.960
You know, you're not
gonna just be paying

20:37.962 --> 20:38.903
outta your pocket
all the time, are you?

20:38.980 --> 20:39.853
Like...
- No, I'm gonna be paying

20:39.930 --> 20:41.239
outta your pocket.

20:41.315 --> 20:42.856
- See? That needs to be
in your business plan

20:42.933 --> 20:44.450
'cause my pockets
have been closed.

20:46.103 --> 20:50.197
- I maybe bit off a little bit
more than I could chew

20:50.274 --> 20:54.368
'cause I didn't consider
how much commitment

20:54.445 --> 20:56.745
from the business line.

20:56.756 --> 21:00.207
I don't know about
any of that stuff,

21:00.284 --> 21:02.501
but I'm not willing
to walk away from it

21:02.578 --> 21:04.545
because if I walk
away from it,

21:04.621 --> 21:06.806
I'm walking away
from my dream.

21:09.126 --> 21:10.768
Baby, can you go check
on the kids, please?

21:10.845 --> 21:13.262
It's bedtime.

want to discuss business,

to talk to you about."

- Okay, yes.
- And I have three children.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.335
- Um, a whole entire husband,

23:50.412 --> 23:52.212
which is like
my fourth child sometimes.

23:52.289 --> 23:53.931
- Of course, they're all.
- Oh, I know about that.

23:54.008 --> 23:55.924
- So, um, yep,
I got grandbabies.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.342
Um...

- So, you're from Annapolis.
- Yes,

24:02.275 --> 24:03.849
and this is probably
the big part

24:03.926 --> 24:05.434
that I want you guys
to understand.

24:05.445 --> 24:08.446
I, um, was in
the foster care system.

24:08.522 --> 24:10.355
- Oh.

24:10.432 --> 24:12.441
- And I was living
with my dad.

24:12.452 --> 24:14.401
He's very abusive
towards my stepmom.

24:14.478 --> 24:15.736
- Okay.
- And I came downstairs.

24:15.812 --> 24:17.012
There's glass everywhere.

24:17.014 --> 24:18.071
She was bleeding from
the top of her head,

24:18.148 --> 24:19.406
and I tried
to break it up,

24:19.483 --> 24:21.241
and my dad, like,
pulled me back,

24:21.318 --> 24:22.868
threw me into the TV.
- Uh-huh, okay.

24:22.945 --> 24:24.912
- So, naturally, I have, like,
all kinds of cuts and scars.

24:24.988 --> 24:26.079
- Mmm.
- Okay.

24:26.156 --> 24:28.290
- And I went to school
the next day,

24:28.301 --> 24:31.585
and a friend saw the blood
coming through my shirt

24:31.662 --> 24:32.711
and told.
- Oh, wow.

24:32.788 --> 24:33.712
- And that was
the last day I went home.

24:33.789 --> 24:34.713
- Oh, what?

24:34.790 --> 24:35.547
- And so, they came
and got you.

24:35.624 --> 24:36.548
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

24:36.625 --> 24:37.641
- Oh, that's sad.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

24:37.718 --> 24:39.034
- Yeah.
- You know, when you're a child,

24:39.036 --> 24:39.718
you don't know.
You just wanna go home, right?

24:39.795 --> 24:40.811
- Yeah, yeah.
- Right.

24:40.888 --> 24:42.295
- You don't wanna be
a stranger's house

24:42.373 --> 24:42.888
with a whole bunch of
other kids sharing a bunkbed.

24:42.965 --> 24:43.805
- Right.
- Yeah.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.374
- You know what I mean?

24:45.376 --> 24:48.560
My mom and I have not started
having a good relationship

24:48.637 --> 24:50.938
until as of recently.

24:51.014 --> 24:52.773
She's been clean
for ten years.

24:52.849 --> 24:53.774
- So, she's in
a better place.

24:53.850 --> 24:55.442
- Yeah, yeah.

24:55.519 --> 24:57.495

41:01.367 --> 41:03.017
- For what?
- Also-also--

41:03.019 --> 41:05.870
- You decided to talk
about my family in front
of the universe.

41:05.947 --> 41:07.455
You lied about my family
on social media.

41:07.466 --> 41:09.281
- Also, Gizelle, you lie
about everybody's family.

41:09.359 --> 41:11.459
So, anyway, I'm not.
- So, why on earth would
I pull you to the side?

41:11.470 --> 41:14.212

accountable for her actions--

41:14.288 --> 41:15.805
- What actions?

41:15.882 --> 41:18.382
We wanted this trip to be nice,
so let's just clear the air.

41:18.459 --> 41:19.976
What are you
talking about?

41:20.053 --> 41:21.811
- I'm not gonna
get into it.

41:21.888 --> 41:24.981
- Are you talking about
Gizelle wishing death on Ray?

41:25.058 --> 41:27.484
- Absolutely.

41:27.560 --> 41:30.820
- I have never said anything
about Ray dying, m'kay?

41:30.897 --> 41:32.104
- Gizelle.

41:32.181 --> 41:33.656
- It's a bullsh-- reason
from four years ago.

41:33.733 --> 41:36.567
- You're gonna need to
attract guys while you can.

41:36.644 --> 41:38.819
- Yes.

He will be buried six feet under

41:42.334 --> 41:43.741

Gizelle is upset

41:43.818 --> 41:46.002
because her whole life
was revealed as a lie,

41:46.079 --> 41:47.670
and she's a fraud and a fake.
[laughing]

41:47.747 --> 41:51.332
So, of course, Gizelle's thing
is to deflect.

41:51.343 --> 41:54.001

to you in the past,

41:54.012 --> 41:55.512
I apologized to you.

41:55.588 --> 41:58.506
You know this Ray bullsh--
is bullsh--, okay?

41:58.517 --> 42:00.850
- She did not wish death
on your husband,

42:00.927 --> 42:02.018
and you know that.
- Sure didn't.

42:02.095 --> 42:03.135
- The point is?
- And you know that.

42:03.212 --> 42:05.304
- I want Ray to live.

I want him
