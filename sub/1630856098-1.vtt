23:32.175 --> 23:33.841
Says his name
is Coriolanus Snow

23:33.875 --> 23:35.274
and clearly, I got
the cake with the cream

23:35.308 --> 23:37.308
'cause nobody else
has even bothered to show up.

23:39.107 --> 23:42.675
The Gamemakers did tell you
to jump in the cage with them?

23:42.707 --> 23:44.874
They didn't tell me not to.

23:44.907 --> 23:46.441
They just said
that it was a mentor's job

23:46.474 --> 23:49.675
to introduce our tributes
to the citizens of Panem.

23:49.707 --> 23:50.874

23:50.907 --> 23:52.107
if Lucy Gray
is brave enough to be here,

23:52.141 --> 23:53.739
-then why shouldn't I be, too?
-LUCKY: Hmm.

For the record,
I didn't have a choice.

23:55.408 --> 23:58.739
For the record, I think
you're about to be
whisked away, young man.

are soon approaching.

So come down to the zoo,
and see these tributes

You.

I'm moving
for the Gamemakers

24:39.606 --> 24:41.839

as mentor immediately.

24:41.873 --> 24:43.673
You said we had to get
our tributes to perform,

24:43.705 --> 24:44.839
not that we had to stay away.

as well.

we're one and the same
as those animals.

24:52.206 --> 24:53.673
Coriolanus didn't
show those people

24:53.705 --> 24:54.973
anything they
didn't already know.

are human beings.

24:58.639 --> 24:59.839
Just like us.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.573
That's why nobody wants
to watch the Games.

25:01.606 --> 25:03.773
It's because people
know deep down

25:03.806 --> 25:05.639
that winning a war
10 years ago

25:05.673 --> 25:07.706
doesn't justify starving
people's children,

25:07.739 --> 25:09.506
taking away their freedoms,
their rights.

25:09.539 --> 25:13.239

26:01.071 --> 26:02.338
Why Games?

26:02.371 --> 26:03.737
Shouldn't we be
asking ourselves

26:03.771 --> 26:05.404
whether or not they're right
in the first place?

26:05.437 --> 26:06.971
You have a problem
with my Games?

26:07.004 --> 26:09.938
Some of those kids
were two years old
when the war ended.

26:09.971 --> 26:12.804
The oldest of them
were only eight.

26:12.837 --> 26:15.638
The Capitol is supposed to be
everyone's government now.

26:15.672 --> 26:17.804
It is supposed to
protect all of us.

26:17.837 --> 26:20.037
I don't see
how making children

26:20.070 --> 26:21.638
fight each other
to the death

26:21.672 --> 26:22.937
is protecting anyone.

might interfere

26:27.337 --> 26:29.037
Perhaps the Capitol students

26:29.070 --> 26:31.638
are ill-suited to be

Maybe we should be viewing

26:43.604 --> 26:46.436

26:46.469 --> 26:49.637
I mean, you saw those kids
in the zoo, they just...

26:49.671 --> 26:51.903
they just wanted
to get to know Lucy Gray.

26:51.937 --> 26:53.570
If we need people to watch,

26:53.604 --> 26:54.836
we should be
letting them get closer

the tribute they cared about

27:05.770 --> 27:07.637

27:07.671 --> 27:09.436
People need someone
to root for

27:09.469 --> 27:10.769
and someone
to root against.

27:10.802 --> 27:12.670
We need them to invest.

27:12.702 --> 27:14.936
And if we bend
a few Capitol laws,

27:14.969 --> 27:17.002
we could even
have them place bets.

may not win in the arena

27:21.535 --> 27:23.902

give her a chance,

I would bet the Plinth Prize

a reason to do it?

go back to 2.

Trust me, that one hasn't
been a girl in a long time.

33:28.427 --> 33:31.160
Outside this Capitol,

33:31.194 --> 33:32.993
they're savages,

33:33.027 --> 33:34.427
one and all.

33:34.460 --> 33:37.527
However, they may smile,

33:37.561 --> 33:39.494
she will use you.

33:39.527 --> 33:41.793
You must use her

34:06.692 --> 34:12.092
In spite of
yesterday's tragic events,

34:12.126 --> 34:16.426
our president has decided
that the Games must go on

34:16.459 --> 34:17.926
to show everyone the Capitol

34:17.959 --> 34:19.991
is unafraid
of such acts of terror.

34:20.025 --> 34:22.725
To which end,
Dr. Gaul wishes you
to preview the arena

34:22.759 --> 34:25.159

with your tributes.

have a little sister.

36:18.123 --> 36:20.390

to win people over.

36:21.623 --> 36:22.756
I can't send you gifts
in the arena

36:22.789 --> 36:24.590

36:24.623 --> 36:29.123
Maybe a guitar
could persuade me. Maybe.

You really wanna
take care of me in
that arena, Coriolanus?

36:43.256 --> 36:45.323
I was crying for hours.

36:45.355 --> 36:48.322

a point to the color?

37:35.921 --> 37:38.221
There's a point to
everything, Ms. Dovecote,

37:38.254 --> 37:39.754
or to nothing at all.

37:39.787 --> 37:43.054
Which brings me
neatly to your proposal.

37:44.154 --> 37:45.921
Which one of you
actually wrote it?

37:45.954 --> 37:48.621
-Well, there was...
-I was inspired

by Coriolanus yesterday,
of course.

His little betting idea.

37:53.853 --> 37:57.987

38:05.054 --> 38:07.719
Very impressive,
Ms. Dovecote.

38:07.753 --> 38:10.420
Unfortunately,
my assistant mistook it

38:10.453 --> 38:12.253
for trash this morning

38:12.287 --> 38:16.153
and lined the shelf
of this very terrarium with it.

38:16.187 --> 38:20.554
So, please, Ms. Dovecote,
retrieve it for us, won't you?

38:20.587 --> 38:24.120
So we might all consider
your inspired ideas.

38:25.786 --> 38:26.953

used to your scent,

38:35.253 --> 38:38.619
if you've handled
their food, for example,

38:38.653 --> 38:41.419
or if they've inhaled
the sweat of your palm

38:41.452 --> 38:43.653

I've asked President Ravinstill

02:20:05.907 --> 02:20:08.073
to grant you a full pardon,

02:20:08.106 --> 02:20:09.874
effective immediately.

02:20:09.907 --> 02:20:13.173
I also told him
that you are too promising

02:20:13.206 --> 02:20:14.673
to waste in the military.

02:20:14.707 --> 02:20:16.839

02:20:27.273 --> 02:20:29.906
All for being such a good friend

02:20:29.939 --> 02:20:31.240
to his Sejanus.

02:20:31.273 --> 02:20:35.372
He doesn't know quite how good
a friend you were, of course.

I never mentioned
your little recording.

02:20:39.472 --> 02:20:40.973
Quite impressive,

02:20:41.006 --> 02:20:44.472
how you sent your

Because I think that won you
the Plinth Prize, after all.

that the Hunger Games

02:21:24.505 --> 02:21:26.772
were punishment
for the districts.

02:21:28.905 --> 02:21:30.838
Then I thought
they served as a warning

02:21:30.872 --> 02:21:33.304
to us here in the Capitol

02:21:33.338 --> 02:21:35.638

I was going to return this
to his parents tonight.

02:23:19.702 --> 02:23:22.136
It would have been
his 19th birthday.

02:23:22.168 --> 02:23:23.168
But I think...

02:23:25.635 --> 02:23:27.235
they would prefer just this.

as an assignment.
