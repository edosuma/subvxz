If I don't give him the lock

escape from the chains so he can

52:10.238 --> 52:13.637
free Maya before she reaches the
snakes.

Each leg?

You need to insure your hands

[ Cheers and applause ]
Come here, pumpkin.

01:22:10.068 --> 01:22:15.068
Come here, little amazing girl.
Heidi, Heidi has a beautiful

01:22:16.568 --> 01:22:20.967
smile on her face.
I have not been this excited

01:22:20.968 --> 01:22:24.167
about a new artist in a very,
very long time.

01:22:24.168 --> 01:22:26.507
Yes.
You definitely are in a

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:28.837
category of your own.
I love the way you dance.

01:22:28.838 --> 01:22:31.067
I love the way you sound.
I love you.

01:22:31.068 --> 01:22:33.037
I think you're very, very
special.

01:22:33.038 --> 01:22:36.267
Thank you so much.
Mel b?

01:22:36.268 --> 01:22:38.607
So how old are you?
14?

01:22:38.608 --> 01:22:40.437
Yeah.
People made fun of the way

01:22:40.438 --> 01:22:45.438
you danced, the way you moved.
People really don't get me.

01:22:46.768 --> 01:22:51.768
We get you.
You are incredible.

01:22:52.608 --> 01:22:54.367
You know what?
Screw them.

01:22:54.368 --> 01:22:56.567
I want tickets to your show
tonight.

01:22:56.568 --> 01:22:59.337
Thank you.
And the next night and the

01:22:59.338 --> 01:23:00.867
next night.
You're amazing.

01:23:00.868 --> 01:23:04.407
Simon?
Normally, I give people

01:23:04.408 --> 01:23:07.307
advice what to do next.
This is my advice.

01:23:07.308 --> 01:23:10.607
Don't listen to a single word I
say.

01:23:10.608 --> 01:23:13.037
Do everything exactly what you
did tonight.

01:23:13.038 --> 01:23:16.907
Because that's what made this so
incredible.

01:23:16.908 --> 01:23:21.207
Howie, an amazing pick again.
We should be starting a record

01:23:21.208 --> 01:23:22.867
label together.
Oh, look.

01:23:22.868 --> 01:23:25.607
It was outstanding.
Howie is gloating and

01:23:25.608 --> 01:23:26.837
smiling.
Glowing.

01:23:26.838 --> 01:23:31.437
I'm so glowing.
You are so amazing.

01:23:31.438 --> 01:23:34.137
Simon came over and gave me a
hug in the middle.

01:23:34.138 --> 01:23:36.507
There aren't words.
I want to tell people to vote

01:23:36.508 --> 01:23:38.907
and scream.
Can I scream?

01:23:38.908 --> 01:23:41.437
[ Screaming ]
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:23:41.438 --> 01:23:42.667
I love you.
Thank you.

01:23:42.668 --> 01:23:47.567
How are you feeling, pumpkin?
Speechless.

01:23:47.568 --> 01:23:51.167
Speechless.
You're amazing!

01:23:51.168 --> 01:23:52.507
Thank you.
All right.

01:23:52.508 --> 01:23:55.407
She needs your votes.
She cannot go through without

01:23:55.408 --> 01:23:58.737
you.
There are a bunch of ways to do

01:23:58.738 --> 01:24:01.367
it.
We'll see you formtomorrow for the

01:24:01.368 --> 01:24:04.667
results at 8:00/7:00 central.
Darcy will be in the house.

01:24:04.668 --> 01:24:05.668
Bye!
