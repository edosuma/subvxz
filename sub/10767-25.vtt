WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:03.649
- Sir?
- Oh, it's delicious.

00:04.453 --> 00:05.727
You should eat some first.

00:08.253 --> 00:12.041
Sir, I hate to disturb you
during feeding time...

00:12.293 --> 00:14.853
...but there's a man snooping
around the premises.

00:16.693 --> 00:18.570
Daddy, call the police.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.971
- I'll handle this.
- No, no, no.

00:21.173 --> 00:23.482
I got this one, Uncle Phil.

00:25.173 --> 00:26.845
What are you doing in our back yard?

00:27.013 --> 00:29.766
Oh, my God, Uncle Phil,
he's got...

00:29.973 --> 00:31.964
...a business card.

00:32.133 --> 00:35.011
I'm sorry if I startled anyone.
Nobody answered the front door.

00:35.173 --> 00:37.368
- I'm a realtor. Ron Reed.
- How are you?

00:37.573 --> 00:40.724
That doesn't give you the right
to go traipsing around our property.

00:40.893 --> 00:43.885
I've got a client prepared
to make a generous offer on this house.

00:44.053 --> 00:47.602
Well, then come on in, Ron.
It is Ron, isn't it?

00:47.773 --> 00:51.686
Sit down. Take a load off. Yes.

00:51.853 --> 00:53.730
Care for some salmon?

00:53.893 --> 00:55.849
Carlton.

00:57.573 --> 01:00.690
- What kind of offer, Mr. Reed?
- Well above market value.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.730
My client wants to buy it
for his nephew.

01:02.893 --> 01:05.851
- But this house is not for sale.
- How much?

01:06.013 --> 01:07.287
Shut up, Carlton.

01:07.453 --> 01:09.842
Mr. And Mrs. Banks,
if you'll hear me out.

01:10.013 --> 01:13.005
You see, my client's nephew grew up
in this house in the '50s...

01:13.173 --> 01:15.892
...and he'd like to repurchase it
for sentimental reasons.

01:16.093 --> 01:18.561
- How much?
- Shut up, Carlton.

01:21.093 --> 01:23.402
Hey, Uncle Phil, man...

01:23.573 --> 01:26.645
...you're not really going to consider
selling this house, are you?

01:26.813 --> 01:29.566
I mean, come on,
this place is special to us.

01:29.733 --> 01:31.928
I'm authorized to bid...

01:32.093 --> 01:34.482
...a half million dollars
above fair-market value.

01:34.893 --> 01:37.202
I'm going to pack my stuff, all right?

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:46.653 --> 02:51.010
It's kind of tempting, huh? Especially
with the real estate market being so soft.

02:51.173 --> 02:53.812
Am I the only one who doesn't
think making money...

02:53.973 --> 02:55.565
...is always the bottom line?

02:55.733 --> 02:57.610
Let's hope so.

02:58.213 --> 02:59.885
Very funny, Carlton.

03:00.053 --> 03:03.807
Look, some stranger wants to buy
this house for sentimental reasons.

03:03.973 --> 03:07.807
What about our sentimental reasons?
We love this house.

03:07.973 --> 03:10.203
You know, I mean...
I think Ashley's right.

03:10.373 --> 03:12.523
I mean, this place has got
a lot of memories.

03:13.293 --> 03:17.081
Living here has been almost
a religious experience.

03:17.253 --> 03:20.768
My father would kill me if he knew
I was out with a boy tonight.

03:20.933 --> 03:23.970
I told him I was going to church.

03:25.813 --> 03:28.088
The Lord is good.

03:30.733 --> 03:33.122
Why don't you come on over here,
sit down and relax.

03:33.293 --> 03:35.045
Okay.

03:46.173 --> 03:48.767
Well, you are pretty slick, Will Smith.

03:48.973 --> 03:51.885
And, I ain't even oiled up yet,
you know.

03:53.773 --> 03:55.968
Hey, you know what?

03:56.173 --> 04:00.132
You can sell the house.
It's the couch that got the memories.

04:01.413 --> 04:03.563
And the Jacuzzi.

04:05.093 --> 04:08.608
- Carlton's little typewriting table.
- Hey.

04:09.773 --> 04:13.766
Look, kids, this is serious.
What should we do, Philip?

04:13.973 --> 04:16.930
I can't imagine living someplace else.

04:17.093 --> 04:20.721
This is where we raised our children
and taught them to be responsible adults.

04:20.892 --> 04:23.691
- Here, Hilary, you take it out.
- Out where?

04:23.853 --> 04:25.081
To the trash cans.

04:25.253 --> 04:28.370
You know, those things you hit
every time you back out the car.

04:28.733 --> 04:31.611
Thank God, I thought
it was the neighbor's kids.

04:32.853 --> 04:36.812
This is gross. I don't touch
greasy, disgusting things.

04:37.013 --> 04:40.164
Well, just pretend it's buying
you dinner afterwards.

04:43.853 --> 04:45.366
- You take it.
- Come on, girl.

04:45.573 --> 04:48.406
And for your information,
dinner comes first.

04:49.973 --> 04:52.567
It's like that, right,
you're gonna slam garbage at me.

04:52.773 --> 04:54.001
Good morning, Will.

04:54.413 --> 04:57.689
- Good morning. Here's your lunch.
- Thank you.

04:57.853 --> 05:00.890
We all knew that Ashley was,
well, cute.

05:01.053 --> 05:04.523
But with my help, she has turned
into an absolute knockout.

05:04.693 --> 05:07.844
So it gives me
great pleasure to present...

05:08.173 --> 05:10.971
...the new Ashley Banks.

05:16.613 --> 05:19.844
Well, isn't she the most
gorgeous creature you've ever seen?

05:20.573 --> 05:23.531
Ashley, sweetheart,
are you comfortable dressed like this?

05:23.693 --> 05:26.810
Well, Daddy, it all comes down
to what Robert thinks, and...

05:26.973 --> 05:30.488
Ashley, aren't we forgetting
something?

05:36.773 --> 05:39.241
You're so in tune with my needs.

05:39.413 --> 05:42.610
It was amazing and endless
and magnificent.

05:42.773 --> 05:45.367
I think I saw God.

05:50.053 --> 05:53.329
- Don't stop.
- The windows... I'm sorry.

05:53.573 --> 05:57.248
- I fell. I fell. I fell.
- We didn't mean to...

05:57.573 --> 06:01.486
You'd think in a house this big,
a fellow would get a little privacy.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.405
Or stronger doors.

06:04.533 --> 06:08.811
Whatever. I still think we shouldn't
sell this house. It's home.

06:08.973 --> 06:12.761
Well, now, Ashley, this house
obviously means a lot to all of us.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.123
But you don't get an offer
like this everyday.

06:15.293 --> 06:18.683
- I'll have to give it some consideration.
- Excuse me?

06:19.213 --> 06:22.489
I mean, your mother and I will have
to give it some real consideration.

06:22.653 --> 06:25.770
Isn't that right, sweetheart? Dear?

06:27.413 --> 06:29.563
If we end up moving
into another guesthouse...

06:29.733 --> 06:32.850
...I'm getting the bedroom this time.
- Not so fast, buster.

06:33.013 --> 06:35.925
Who knows if the new place
is even gonna have a guesthouse?

06:36.293 --> 06:39.683
Don't worry, we'll bring
a shoebox you can sleep in.

06:40.293 --> 06:42.966
Listen, my friend,
I haven't exactly gotten a kick...

06:43.133 --> 06:44.885
...out of being your roommate either.

06:45.053 --> 06:47.487
I mean, I can't imagine anything
more irritating...

06:47.653 --> 06:49.484
...than sharing a pool house with you.

06:49.973 --> 06:53.204
I can. How about sharing
a jail cell with you?

06:55.613 --> 06:58.366
Come on, man, let it go.
You'll feel better.

07:28.013 --> 07:30.208
Yeah, well, that whole fiasco
was your fault.

07:30.373 --> 07:32.841
You're totally immature.

07:35.813 --> 07:37.531
I'm immature?

07:37.693 --> 07:41.208
Well, isn't that the munchkin
calling the midget short.

07:45.093 --> 07:47.243
Oh, what a night, I made a killing.

07:47.413 --> 07:48.971
Twenty-six Milky Ways.

07:49.133 --> 07:52.330
And the Democrats say
there's a recession.

07:52.933 --> 07:54.366
What are you supposed to be?

07:55.053 --> 07:57.692
My idol, Macaulay Culkin.

07:59.413 --> 08:00.846
And you know why he's my idol?

08:01.013 --> 08:03.686
Why? Because y'all the same height?

08:03.973 --> 08:05.486
How dare you two defy me?

08:05.653 --> 08:08.247
Now, see here, big guy.

08:12.973 --> 08:15.362
Oh, my God! Howard!

08:17.093 --> 08:19.926
And to think, I laid out
50 big ones on your damn cake.

08:20.093 --> 08:23.483
And not just any cake, I got you that
really neat one in the commercials.

08:23.653 --> 08:24.927
You know, the one that goes:

08:31.293 --> 08:33.363
Carlton, Carlton.

08:34.813 --> 08:38.010
Come to think of it, I don't know
how I've been around you this long.

08:38.173 --> 08:40.243
What's wrong with being around me?

08:41.453 --> 08:45.366
Well, how about I'll take
"always embarrassing me" for 500, Alex.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.653
What have I ever done
to embarrass you?

08:49.453 --> 08:51.569
Well, you got a few days?

08:52.133 --> 08:53.805
You really think we made it?

08:53.973 --> 08:57.966
Hey, look, man, whether we did or not,
you hung in there and I'm proud of you.

08:58.933 --> 09:00.332
You're proud of me?

09:00.493 --> 09:03.246
You never said that to me before
in your life.

09:03.413 --> 09:05.563
Give me a hug.

09:06.453 --> 09:09.889
You see, man, that is exactly
why I'll never tell you nothing.

09:15.493 --> 09:17.245
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

09:17.613 --> 09:19.410
Admit it, Will. You care about me.

09:19.573 --> 09:21.325
I do not.

09:22.013 --> 09:24.811
Yes, you do. You like me.
You like having me around.

09:24.973 --> 09:26.725
Carlton, take it back, man.

09:26.893 --> 09:30.932
Face it. You've just got to face it.

09:31.453 --> 09:33.171
You love me.

09:34.453 --> 09:36.045
All right, that was a bad example.

09:36.213 --> 09:39.171
I mean, you're not so much
of an embarrassment.

09:40.053 --> 09:41.771
Apology accepted.

09:42.853 --> 09:44.525
Hey, Carl... Come one.

09:44.693 --> 09:46.365
Hey, man. Damn.

09:50.193 --> 09:54.232
So after careful consideration,
we've decided not to sell.

09:54.393 --> 09:56.384
- Oh, Daddy.
- Oh, man!

09:56.553 --> 09:59.704
When it came down to it,
we just couldn't part with this place.

09:59.873 --> 10:03.388
In the final analysis, there are
more important things than money.

10:03.553 --> 10:06.750
Would everyone stop saying that?
I'm getting a migraine.

10:07.953 --> 10:10.706
We got some baby Tylenol
in the kitchen.

10:14.713 --> 10:16.032
Hello.

10:16.193 --> 10:18.468
Ron. Yeah,
I was just going to call you.

10:18.673 --> 10:23.030
Look, we've talked it over,
and we've decided not to sell.

10:23.513 --> 10:25.743
No, I'm sorry, I don't think
there's anything...

10:25.913 --> 10:27.904
...that you can say
that could change...

10:28.673 --> 10:30.709
What's that? You're kidding.

10:30.873 --> 10:33.262
Could you hold on for a minute,
please? Thank you.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.230
Philip, what's going on?

10:35.393 --> 10:39.352
Ron said that his buyer
is willing to go $ 1 million dollars...

10:39.513 --> 10:41.868
...above market value.

10:46.673 --> 10:48.709
Yes, there is a God!

10:49.353 --> 10:51.628
Look at you all.

10:52.273 --> 10:54.150
Will say something.

10:55.073 --> 10:57.223
Ching, ching!

11:03.013 --> 11:05.652
Okay, thank you very much. Bye-bye.

11:05.813 --> 11:08.805
That was Ron. The buyer is flying
in this evening from New York.

11:08.973 --> 11:10.929
Yeah! A million dollars.

11:11.093 --> 11:13.368
But I don't want to move.

11:16.013 --> 11:17.765
Hey, girl.

11:17.933 --> 11:21.050
Now, Ashley,
this is a million dollars here.

11:21.253 --> 11:24.563
Now, listen, Uncle Phil could put
that money in the bank, right...

11:24.733 --> 11:27.247
...and then start getting
all kinds of crazy interest.

11:27.453 --> 11:30.286
Then it's bonds,
and then there's that T-bill stuff...

11:30.453 --> 11:33.843
...and then they got some certificates,
and then junk be compounded.

11:34.013 --> 11:37.050
- What are you talking about?
- I have no idea.

11:38.213 --> 11:41.285
Money, money, money.
Is that all you people care about?

11:41.453 --> 11:43.444
I have been very happy in this house.

11:43.613 --> 11:46.286
A lot of exciting things
have happened to me here.

11:46.453 --> 11:48.603
Ashley, you're 15 years old.

11:48.813 --> 11:51.566
I mean, how much excitement
could you possibly have had?

11:51.733 --> 11:54.201
A lot more than you, Carlton.

12:15.293 --> 12:16.726
Happy birthday, Ashley.

12:20.293 --> 12:22.966
I think I'd feel better...

12:23.133 --> 12:24.851
...if I could kiss you.

12:28.253 --> 12:30.448
I'm sorry. Is that terrible?

12:31.893 --> 12:33.565
No.

12:34.373 --> 12:37.490
Is it terrible
that I wanna kiss you back?

12:44.613 --> 12:46.604
Can I blow in your ear?

12:51.613 --> 12:53.126
Why?

12:54.013 --> 12:56.573
I don't know, I heard Will say it.

12:58.173 --> 12:59.891
Okay.

13:04.653 --> 13:07.565
Hey, Ashley, you ain't telling me
that dude blew in your ear.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.085
Me either.

13:11.093 --> 13:13.527
I embellished.

13:15.013 --> 13:17.971
Uncle Phil, I think you've more
than made your opinion known...

13:18.133 --> 13:20.169
...to Ashley and her boyfriends.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.608
- Who do we have here?
- We met at the mall.

13:22.773 --> 13:24.843
What's your name, son?

13:25.093 --> 13:26.606
This.

13:29.373 --> 13:32.206
This is a stick with a snake
wrapped around it.

13:32.373 --> 13:35.445
- It's a symbol, like Prince.
- Prince who?

13:36.613 --> 13:39.889
See, that's exactly why fathers
ain't allowed at the mall.

13:48.533 --> 13:49.807
What's this thing?

13:49.973 --> 13:53.329
It's a symbol for
"get out of my house!"

13:54.813 --> 13:57.373
So I lost my temper once.
Who hasn't?

13:57.973 --> 14:00.009
Excuse me. Once?

14:00.173 --> 14:02.243
Speaking as a lawyer,
I say your daughter...

14:02.413 --> 14:04.404
...suits the criminal profile to a T.

14:04.573 --> 14:07.292
Right down to the low-sloping forehead
and the wide jaw...

14:07.453 --> 14:10.604
...suitable for grains
and small rodents.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.608
I think you must have her confused
with your mama.

14:16.053 --> 14:18.009
I don't want you to move out.

14:18.213 --> 14:19.931
Sorry, Dad, I have to go.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.209
- No, you don't.
- Will says I do.

14:22.373 --> 14:25.331
He says it's time for me to leave
the nest, become independent...

14:25.493 --> 14:27.768
...and have sex with girls.

14:28.413 --> 14:30.608
Safe sex, mind you, but lots of it.

14:32.013 --> 14:35.164
Excuse me. Is this what
you've been telling my boy?

14:35.333 --> 14:36.846
- What?
- That life is one big orgy.

14:37.013 --> 14:39.208
- I ain't never said...
- College is hard work, son...

14:39.413 --> 14:41.643
Followed by a family,
which is even more hard work.

14:41.813 --> 14:44.566
And a teenage daughter who doesn't
wanna be seen with you in public.

14:44.733 --> 14:46.849
And a wife who won't let you
anywhere near her.

14:47.013 --> 14:49.732
And a butler who may be
the father of your child.

14:49.893 --> 14:52.453
- And a gardener, a gardener...
- Dad! Dad!

15:01.333 --> 15:04.803
You big-eared freeloader! You take
your little square-headed cousin here...

15:04.973 --> 15:07.282
...and you find Geoffrey,
and you bring him back...

15:07.453 --> 15:09.171
...or they'll never find your bodies.

15:09.333 --> 15:12.564
And I'm a judge,
I can make it happen.

15:13.973 --> 15:16.771
All right. All right,
so I have an ugly side.

15:16.973 --> 15:20.010
And you could write "Goodyear" on it.

15:22.133 --> 15:25.330
The more I think about it, I won't mind
saying goodbye to this place.

15:25.493 --> 15:29.406
I mean, I've experienced
the greatest tragedies of my life here.

15:35.173 --> 15:36.891
Damn.

15:38.293 --> 15:39.931
And I mean that...

15:40.093 --> 15:43.722
...in the nicest possible way, Hil.

15:46.253 --> 15:49.086
I look like a troll doll.

15:49.773 --> 15:51.889
Look, there he goes.

15:52.853 --> 15:54.844
<i>Hilary Banks...</i>

15:55.013 --> 15:56.844
Yes, Trevor?

15:57.013 --> 16:00.005
<i>Will you marry me...?</i>

16:23.653 --> 16:27.248
I ain't no bungee expert or nothing...

16:27.413 --> 16:30.883
...but I don't think he's supposed
to be slamming into the ground like that.

16:31.093 --> 16:33.049
If I hadn't asked
for a special proposal...

16:33.213 --> 16:35.090
...Trevor would be in my arms...

16:35.253 --> 16:38.484
...instead of in my purse.

16:41.373 --> 16:43.364
I love you, Trevor.

16:47.253 --> 16:48.845
Hilary...

16:49.093 --> 16:51.561
...Trevor wasn't cremated.

16:55.053 --> 16:57.283
Then who's this?

17:00.853 --> 17:04.084
I'll see him to the door, Miss Hilary.

17:05.373 --> 17:07.840
I'm still not over that hair thing.

17:11.813 --> 17:14.247
We're gonna need
some hors d'oeuvres tonight.

17:14.413 --> 17:17.962
- What do we have in the house?
- Whatever he hasn't eaten.

17:18.653 --> 17:22.123
Geoffrey, for once,
could you please cut the sarcasm?

17:22.693 --> 17:26.367
Sarcasm? Whatever do you mean?

17:26.933 --> 17:28.570
Geoffrey, go fetch my tools.

17:28.733 --> 17:31.247
You mean your knife and fork?

17:33.053 --> 17:35.169
Jazz, to what do we owe
your presence?

17:35.333 --> 17:38.211
My guess would be inbreeding.

17:38.693 --> 17:43.813
Sweetheart, it hasn't been that
long since we've made love, has it?

17:44.213 --> 17:46.408
Five months this Tuesday.

17:48.293 --> 17:52.252
Why, that's just
good-natured ribbing, sir...

17:52.413 --> 17:56.691
...unlike those ruthless barbs
from Master William.

17:57.373 --> 17:59.329
Me?

18:07.613 --> 18:10.446
Earthquake!

18:10.893 --> 18:12.485
Man changed my life.

18:12.653 --> 18:14.883
Turned a skinny little kid
from South Carolina...

18:15.053 --> 18:16.452
...into the man you see today.

18:16.613 --> 18:17.887
And you know how?

18:18.053 --> 18:19.850
He challenged me.

18:20.013 --> 18:22.527
To what? A pie eating contest?

18:22.693 --> 18:24.524
What is wrong with you people?

18:24.693 --> 18:27.730
I weigh the same thing
I weighed in high school.

18:30.213 --> 18:33.205
Yeah, if you add up all four years.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.811
Hey, hey, man.

18:41.973 --> 18:45.443
Man, have I told you how thin
you're looking lately?

18:47.093 --> 18:50.051
You know,
especially around your chins.

18:50.413 --> 18:51.812
I mean...

18:52.093 --> 18:53.492
Damn.

18:56.613 --> 18:57.807
That must be him.

18:57.973 --> 19:01.409
Now, we're doing the right thing,
aren't we? We should sell.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.291
Oh, my God, she's buckling, Dad.

19:03.493 --> 19:05.290
- Throw some cold water on her.
- Carlton.

19:06.253 --> 19:08.892
Of course we're doing
the right thing, sweetheart.

19:09.053 --> 19:12.250
Sir, it is my esteemed pleasure
to introduce...

19:12.413 --> 19:15.689
...Mr. And Mrs. Donald Trump.

19:20.013 --> 19:23.403
It's The Donald! Oh, my God!

19:27.093 --> 19:31.484
Mr. And Mrs. Trump,
it's an honor to meet you.

19:33.453 --> 19:37.685
Well, Ron said his client
had a rich uncle, but Donald Trump.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.893
I like keeping a low profile.

19:41.613 --> 19:44.366
- Hi. Hilary Banks.
- Hi, Hilary.

19:44.533 --> 19:47.570
You know, you look
much richer in person.

19:50.413 --> 19:53.485
Hey, Mr. Trump.
Hey, how are you doing? Will Smith.

19:53.653 --> 19:56.611
Hey, listen, you are getting
a great house here.

19:56.773 --> 20:00.288
And this is quite a deal
you're getting for it too.

20:00.493 --> 20:05.283
Tell you what, throw in another 50 grand,
I'll cut the grass for you every Saturday.

20:05.613 --> 20:09.925
Look, folks, before we go too far,
I've got something to tell you.

20:10.093 --> 20:13.290
Excuse me, but I've got
something to tell you first.

20:13.493 --> 20:15.848
Thank you for ruining my life.

20:16.013 --> 20:19.164
- Ashley.
- What did you do?

20:19.333 --> 20:22.564
Everybody's always blaming me
for everything.

20:23.173 --> 20:25.243
Come on, let's sit down,
sign some papers.

20:25.413 --> 20:28.962
Mr. Banks, there's been
a little mistake.

20:29.133 --> 20:32.887
Mr. Trump's nephew grew up
at 508 Saint Cloud Road.

20:33.933 --> 20:38.370
And all this time I thought our address
was 805 Saint Cloud Road.

20:38.533 --> 20:40.569
It is, Hilary.

20:41.373 --> 20:44.285
It's very embarrassing.
Apparently, I inverted the numbers.

20:44.453 --> 20:46.489
I don't know what to say,
except I'm sorry.

20:46.653 --> 20:48.245
That makes two of us.

20:49.173 --> 20:50.891
Well, that's business.

20:51.053 --> 20:55.126
Let's go down the street.
I brought cash, it's quicker.

20:55.293 --> 20:56.567
Nice meeting you all.

20:56.813 --> 20:59.691
It's just as well,
it's too much of a fixer-upper.

21:01.573 --> 21:04.326
Vivian, Vivian, Vivian!

21:06.413 --> 21:08.051
What happened?

21:08.213 --> 21:10.329
Donald Trump walked in,
and you passed out.

21:10.493 --> 21:13.212
Donald! Where is he?

21:13.933 --> 21:16.606
He'll be the guy carrying
the millions of dollars in cash.

21:16.773 --> 21:18.889
If you hurry up, man...

21:23.773 --> 21:27.288
Well, I guess
this makes you very happy?

21:27.453 --> 21:29.683
And you are too. Come on, admit it.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.286
Yes, we're staying.

21:32.653 --> 21:35.531
Yeah, it's... You know,
it's probably for the best.

21:35.733 --> 21:38.691
I guess deep down inside
none of us really wanted to move.

21:46.133 --> 21:50.092
Of course, I do hear Des Moines
is great this time of year.

21:55.133 --> 21:57.601
In five, four, three, two...

21:57.773 --> 22:00.810
But it'll cut into my trick or treat...

22:01.493 --> 22:03.006
Here we go.

22:03.173 --> 22:05.403
But it'll cut into my trick or treat...

22:07.253 --> 22:09.608
I'm just gonna say my line
and "go."

22:15.013 --> 22:17.481
I just won a thousand dollars.

22:19.693 --> 22:22.491
Five, four, three, two...

22:27.893 --> 22:30.885
It ain't me. It ain't me.

22:31.213 --> 22:34.410
- It was him.
- No, I was here. I was cool.

22:34.573 --> 22:35.926
Oh, yeah.

22:37.373 --> 22:39.045
I can't get it out.

22:39.213 --> 22:40.487
I cannot get it out.

22:40.653 --> 22:42.803
Come on, one more shot.
One more shot. One more shot.

22:43.305 --> 22:49.380
