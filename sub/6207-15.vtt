00:05.231 --> 00:08.099
Are you saying that 
this is the Apocalypse?

00:08.669 --> 00:11.570
- These omens, they're prelude to what?
- The four horsemen.

00:11.772 --> 00:14.297
- And which one rides the red horse?
War.

00:15.109 --> 00:17.043
This town is suffering from famine.

00:17.211 --> 00:19.202
- As in the horseman?
- Great.

00:20.815 --> 00:23.808
The Angel of Death
must be brought into this world...

00:24.052 --> 00:26.077
through a place of awful carnage.

00:26.288 --> 00:28.950
Oh, hello, Death.

00:29.124 --> 00:31.456
Bobby, who is that?
- She's my wife.

00:31.693 --> 00:34.992
It's the end of the world, and if I
don't stop it and save everyone...

00:35.197 --> 00:37.062
...then no one will and we all die.

00:40.136 --> 00:42.331
And I'm just tired, man.

00:42.972 --> 00:44.564
And I'm done.

00:44.741 --> 00:46.606
I am just done.

00:46.809 --> 00:48.606
I need some help.

<i>And the wildebeest
lounges, lazy and self-content.</i>

01:23.148 --> 01:26.380
<i>It is oblivious to the predator
that stalks him from the shadows.</i>

01:26.552 --> 01:29.487
<i>The great wildebeest herds
migrate south in search of water...</i>

01:29.655 --> 01:32.886
<i>... drinking their fill in preparation
for the long dry season to come.</i>

01:35.161 --> 01:36.651
<i>The wildebeests are on edge...</i>

01:36.829 --> 01:39.320
<i>... every movement,
every sound a potential attacker.</i>

01:39.498 --> 01:41.899
<i>The merest rustle of a wind
can spur the herd...</i>

01:42.068 --> 01:44.559
<i>... into a bone-crushing stamp...</i>

02:10.330 --> 02:12.856
<i>First,
the animal reacts with confusion...</i>

02:28.383 --> 02:31.945
<i>The wildebeest returns warily
to its watering hole.</i>

02:43.633 --> 02:44.828
No.

02:49.340 --> 02:51.865
<i>When closing in for the kill,
it attacks...</i>

02:52.543 --> 02:53.874
<i>... attacks quickly.</i>

02:54.044 --> 02:56.342
No. No, please.

02:56.547 --> 02:57.980
God, no.

03:09.728 --> 03:10.922
Bobby, listen.

03:11.796 --> 03:14.856
When you get this message, call,
okay?

03:15.066 --> 03:16.159
Is he still not home?

03:16.369 --> 03:18.564
How far could he get in that chair?

03:23.376 --> 03:25.173
So, what do we do?

03:28.581 --> 03:31.779
Well, guess we just do it ourselves.

03:33.587 --> 03:34.849
Thank you.

03:35.022 --> 03:37.923
Mr. Wells, why don't you tell us
what you saw in your words?

03:38.125 --> 03:39.820
- Call me Digger.
- Digger?

03:40.894 --> 03:43.624
- Who gave you that name?
- I did.

03:43.830 --> 03:46.298
You gave yourself your own nickname?
Can't do that.

03:46.466 --> 03:47.957
Who died and made you queen?

03:49.337 --> 03:51.897
Okay, why don't you just tell us
what you saw?

03:52.941 --> 03:55.375
I saw Clay Thompson...

03:55.543 --> 03:58.410
...climb into Benny Sutton's trailer
through the window.

03:58.613 --> 04:02.105
Couple minutes later,
Clay walked out and Benny's dead.

04:02.985 --> 04:04.543
And...

04:05.688 --> 04:07.519
Is this the guy you saw?

04:07.690 --> 04:10.158
He was all covered in mud, but yeah.
That's Clay.

04:11.026 --> 04:13.722
And you are aware
that Clay Thompson died five years ago?

04:14.296 --> 04:15.786
Yep.

04:15.965 --> 04:19.925
- You're positive that it was this guy?
- You calling me a liar?

04:20.136 --> 04:21.966
No, no, no. Of course not.

04:22.172 --> 04:25.164
Look, can you think of any reason
why Clay Thompson...

04:25.375 --> 04:28.242
...alive or dead,
would wanna kill Benny Sutton?

04:28.478 --> 04:30.912
Heh, heh. Hell, yeah.

04:31.081 --> 04:32.207
Well, five years ago...

04:32.382 --> 04:35.181
...Benny's the one that killed Clay
in the first place.

04:35.653 --> 04:38.850
- Is that a fact?
- Well, yeah, so-called hunting accident.

04:39.056 --> 04:41.183
But if you ask me...

04:41.993 --> 04:44.985
...Clay came back from the grave
to get a little payback.

04:48.032 --> 04:49.056
Go on.

04:49.266 --> 04:54.671
Owen, put down the cupcake
and pick up an apple, okay?

04:54.840 --> 04:57.400
Okay. I love you.

05:01.546 --> 05:03.480
Heads up. Fargo.

05:04.850 --> 05:06.250
Digger.

05:06.419 --> 05:07.511
Sheriff.

05:08.221 --> 05:11.384
I'm Sheriff Jody Mills.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

05:11.591 --> 05:14.355
Agents Dorfman and Neidermeyer.
FBI.

05:14.861 --> 05:16.522
Welcome to Sioux Falls, gentlemen.

05:17.563 --> 05:19.497
Can I ask what you're doing
with Digger?

05:19.699 --> 05:21.691
Oh, they're doing their job.

05:21.869 --> 05:24.201
They believe me, sheriff.

05:27.041 --> 05:29.271
The FBI believes a dead man
committed a murder?

05:29.443 --> 05:31.934
Look, we're just asking a few questions,
that's all.

05:32.112 --> 05:35.639
Of course, if a dead man didn't commit
the murder, then who did?

05:37.084 --> 05:38.950
What did you say
your jurisdiction was?

05:39.154 --> 05:42.385
Our jurisdiction is wherever
the United States government sends us.

05:42.557 --> 05:45.287
How about me and your supervisor
chat about that?

05:45.460 --> 05:46.927
Absolutely.

06:02.611 --> 06:03.635
Agent Willis speaking.

06:03.846 --> 06:07.043
Agent Willis,
this is Sheriff Jody Mills...

06:07.349 --> 06:09.614
- Bobby?
- Oh.

06:11.721 --> 06:13.211
<i>Excuse me?</i>

06:13.390 --> 06:14.618
Is this Bobby Singer?

06:16.159 --> 06:20.425
<i>Listen, I don't know who this is,
but this is Agent Tom Willis of the FBI.</i>

06:20.630 --> 06:22.598
Bull crap.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.863
FBI, huh?

06:26.070 --> 06:27.765
So...

06:28.206 --> 06:29.503
So you know Bobby Singer?

06:29.707 --> 06:33.336
That is a fun coincidence. Heh, heh.

06:33.578 --> 06:35.375
Here's what I know
about Bobby Singer.

06:35.580 --> 06:36.808
He's a menace around here.

06:36.981 --> 06:39.472
Ass-full of drunk and disorderlies
and mail fraud.

06:39.650 --> 06:40.675
You understanding me?

06:40.886 --> 06:44.720
I think we all can agree that you
made yourself perfectly clear, yes.

06:44.890 --> 06:48.326
So whatever the three of you
are planning, it ends here.

06:48.994 --> 06:50.188
Now.

06:50.696 --> 06:52.391
Ten-four on that, agents?

06:52.631 --> 06:53.996
Yeah.

06:57.670 --> 06:59.365
You know how many times we called?

06:59.539 --> 07:00.972
Where have you been?

07:01.141 --> 07:03.336
Playing murderball.

07:03.510 --> 07:06.035
What's that smell? Is that soap?

07:06.246 --> 07:08.214
- Did you clean?
- What are you, my mother?

07:08.381 --> 07:10.611
- Bite me.
- Bobby, seriously.

07:10.817 --> 07:13.412
Been working.
Trying to find a way to stop the devil.

07:13.654 --> 07:15.815
- Find anything?
- What do you think?

07:15.990 --> 07:17.719
Bobby, it's just...

07:18.626 --> 07:21.993
There's a case
less than five miles from your house.

07:22.163 --> 07:23.824
What, the Benny Sutton thing?

07:24.031 --> 07:26.022
- That's what this is about?
- You knew?

07:26.200 --> 07:28.362
Hell, yes, I checked into it.
Nothing here.

07:28.570 --> 07:31.198
Except a witness who saw a dead guy
commit murder.

07:31.406 --> 07:34.432
- What witness? Digger Wells?
- Yeah. So?

07:34.676 --> 07:35.700
So he's a drunk.

07:35.877 --> 07:37.674
The lightning storms?
Look like omens.

07:37.879 --> 07:41.576
Except in February in South Dakota,
in storm season.

07:42.584 --> 07:45.179
Guys, I thought it was something too.

07:45.788 --> 07:47.722
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

07:47.890 --> 07:50.051
- So who killed the guy?
- Take your pick.

07:50.226 --> 07:53.218
This Benny Sutton guy
was a grade-A son of a bitch.

07:53.696 --> 07:57.223
There's a list of the living
wouldn't mind putting a cap in his ass.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.426
So you're telling us nothing.

08:00.370 --> 08:03.737
Sorry, looks like you wasted
a tank of gas on this one.

08:04.308 --> 08:05.798
Great.

08:19.557 --> 08:21.081
What's up?

08:21.726 --> 08:24.058
Isn't that the graveyard back there?

08:25.263 --> 08:27.823
Yeah, so what?
Bobby already checked it out.

08:27.999 --> 08:30.298
And? What, Bobby's never wrong?

08:31.270 --> 08:33.635
Come on, we'll take a peek
and then hit the road.

08:33.806 --> 08:35.433
Can't hurt.

08:48.622 --> 08:50.089
Hey.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.154
That look fresh to you?

08:55.362 --> 08:57.023
Yeah, actually.

09:21.957 --> 09:24.482
What's going on here?

09:25.527 --> 09:27.961
I don't know. But something stinks.

10:24.256 --> 10:26.622
Don't shoot me, please.
There's money in the safe.

10:26.826 --> 10:28.623
- We don't want your money.
- What?

10:29.195 --> 10:30.253
Anything, please.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.397
You're Clay Thompson, right?

10:34.433 --> 10:36.129
Who are you?

10:36.336 --> 10:37.360
Uh, ahem.

10:37.537 --> 10:40.438
- FBI.
- FBI?

10:40.874 --> 10:43.843
- Oh, my God, this is about Benny.
- What about Benny?

10:44.044 --> 10:47.036
He killed me, he shot me.
I'm supposed to let him get away?

10:47.214 --> 10:48.909
Hold up. Are you confessing?

10:49.116 --> 10:53.486
Please, I'll go with you.
Just don't wake my kids.

10:53.654 --> 10:57.215
- You'll go with us where?
- Jail.

10:58.459 --> 11:00.393
Let me get this straight.

11:00.928 --> 11:04.557
- You're Clay Thompson and you died?
- Yes.

11:04.766 --> 11:07.098
You climbed out of your grave
and killed Sutton.

11:07.269 --> 11:09.100
- Yes.
- So you are, in fact, a dead guy.

11:09.271 --> 11:11.296
I guess. I don't know what I am.

11:12.741 --> 11:13.765
Clay?

11:15.477 --> 11:16.501
I called 911.

11:16.678 --> 11:19.579
It's okay, these men are the FBI.
They're here about Benny.

11:19.782 --> 11:22.649
Why don't you come with us?
I think that'd be best.

11:27.690 --> 11:29.180
Dean.

11:29.526 --> 11:31.118
He's a monster.

11:31.294 --> 11:33.091
He's a soccer dad.

11:33.263 --> 11:35.128
What do you wanna do with him?

11:35.532 --> 11:36.794
Freeze.

11:37.667 --> 11:39.101
Drop your guns.

11:40.171 --> 11:43.607
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.
All right, hey.

11:43.941 --> 11:47.672
Remember the guy you said was dead
and couldn't possibly commit murder?

11:47.845 --> 11:49.142
There he is.

11:50.548 --> 11:52.106
And?

11:52.917 --> 11:54.545
And?

11:54.719 --> 11:58.120
And you're welcome
for catching the undead killer zombie.

11:58.323 --> 12:01.952
Whatever he is or isn't, that don't
give you the right to shoot him.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.855
- Shoot me?
- You're free to go.

12:04.062 --> 12:05.927
- Free to go?
- You were gonna kill me.

12:06.131 --> 12:07.723
- You're a zombie.
- I'm a taxpayer.

12:14.974 --> 12:17.442
So what? The sheriff's on the take?

12:17.710 --> 12:18.734
Yeah, no.

12:18.945 --> 12:21.345
What, the zombies are paying her off?

12:24.750 --> 12:26.241
Hey.

12:32.559 --> 12:34.049
So, what, now they're friends?

12:38.832 --> 12:40.663
Bobby,
I thought the sheriff hated you.

12:40.834 --> 12:42.826
She did till five days ago.

12:43.037 --> 12:46.370
- What happened five days ago?
- The dead started rising all over town.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.843
- So you knew about this?
- Yep.

12:51.079 --> 12:54.674
I think what Sam meant to say
is, you lied to us?

12:56.050 --> 13:00.715
Look, I told you there was nothing here,
and there isn't.

13:00.890 --> 13:02.016
Not for you.

13:04.426 --> 13:05.723
There are zombies here.

13:05.928 --> 13:09.625
There's zombies
and then there's zombies.

13:11.133 --> 13:12.225
Come with me.

13:19.776 --> 13:21.767
You wanna tell us what the hell...?

13:22.445 --> 13:24.106
Oh, hey.

13:27.551 --> 13:29.611
I didn't realize
you were bringing company.

13:29.820 --> 13:32.414
It's 4 a.m., babe.
You didn't need to cook.

13:32.623 --> 13:35.558
Oh, please. I'll get some more plates.

13:39.263 --> 13:40.287
Who was that?

13:40.531 --> 13:42.089
Karen, my wife.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.568
Your new wife?

13:45.804 --> 13:47.101
My dead wife.

13:56.081 --> 13:58.276
Mm. Mm.

13:58.450 --> 14:00.214
This is incredible, Mrs. Singer.

14:00.420 --> 14:02.251
Thank you, Dean.

14:03.289 --> 14:04.779
What? It is.

14:07.860 --> 14:09.828
Looks great, Karen. Thanks.

14:09.996 --> 14:12.464
Could you...?
Could you just give us a minute?

14:23.444 --> 14:24.911
Are you crazy? What the hell?

14:25.112 --> 14:26.272
Dean, I can explain.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.879
Explain what? Lying to us?

14:28.382 --> 14:30.577
Or the zombie
making cupcakes in your kitchen?

14:30.784 --> 14:33.253
First of all, that's my wife,
so watch it.

14:33.421 --> 14:36.015
Bobby, whatever that is,
it is not your wife.

14:36.257 --> 14:37.315
How do you know that?

14:37.525 --> 14:40.016
- Are you serious?
- You think I'm an idiot, boy?

14:40.195 --> 14:42.026
My dead wife shows up
on my doorstep...

14:42.197 --> 14:44.665
...I'm not gonna test her
every way I ever learned?

14:45.433 --> 14:47.094
So, what is it? Zombies, revenants?

14:47.303 --> 14:48.395
Hell if I can tell.

14:48.904 --> 14:54.171
She's got no scars, no wounds,
no reaction to salt, silver, holy water.

14:54.343 --> 14:56.208
Bobby, she crawled out of her coffin.

14:56.445 --> 14:58.845
No, she didn't. I cremated her.

15:00.616 --> 15:03.347
Somehow, some way she's back.

15:03.553 --> 15:05.418
- That's impossible.
- Tell me about it.

15:05.622 --> 15:06.987
- You bury her ashes?
- Yeah.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.682
Where?
- The cemetery.

15:09.860 --> 15:11.555
That's where they all rose from.

15:11.795 --> 15:14.161
- How many?
- Fifteen, 20.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.322
I made a list.

15:18.368 --> 15:21.202
There's Karen, Clay.

15:21.372 --> 15:25.035
Sheriff Mills, her little boy came back.

15:25.209 --> 15:26.870
And there were no signs? No omens?

15:27.945 --> 15:30.379
Well, there were the lightning storms.

15:30.848 --> 15:32.679
That's what we said. What else?

15:43.195 --> 15:46.722
"And through the fire stood before me,
a pale horse."

15:46.899 --> 15:50.027
And he that sat atop him
carried a scythe.

15:50.737 --> 15:54.764
And I saw since he had risen,
they too shall rise...

15:55.008 --> 15:58.239
"...and from him and through him."

16:02.982 --> 16:05.416
So, what, Death is behind this?

16:05.853 --> 16:08.845
"Death" death?
Like, Grim Reaper, death?

16:09.423 --> 16:10.913
Yeah.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.893
Awesome. Another horseman.

16:15.362 --> 16:17.353
Must be Thursday.

16:20.000 --> 16:26.770
Bobby, why would Death raise 15 people
in a podunk town like Sioux Falls?

16:27.709 --> 16:29.301
I don't know.

16:29.511 --> 16:33.003
You know, if Death is behind this,
then whatever these things are...

16:33.315 --> 16:35.044
...it's not good.

16:36.752 --> 16:39.051
You know what we have to do here.

16:40.389 --> 16:42.254
She doesn't remember anything,
you know.

16:42.458 --> 16:45.154
- What do you mean?
- Being possessed.

16:45.428 --> 16:49.091
Me killing her, her coming back.

16:49.298 --> 16:53.167
- Bobby...
- No, no, don't "Bobby" me.

16:53.337 --> 16:54.395
Just...

16:56.640 --> 16:57.834
Just listen, okay?

17:02.479 --> 17:05.039
She hums when she cooks.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.286
Yeah.

17:09.753 --> 17:14.281
She always used to hum
when she cooked.

17:15.093 --> 17:17.584
Tone deaf as all hell.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.097
And I never thought
I would hear it again.

17:30.976 --> 17:33.501
Look, just read Revelation. The...

17:33.679 --> 17:35.977
The dead rise during the Apocalypse.

17:36.148 --> 17:38.673
There's nothing in there
that says that's bad.

17:38.884 --> 17:40.716
Hell, maybe it's the one good thing...

17:40.887 --> 17:43.617
...that comes out
of this whole bloody mess.

17:45.458 --> 17:47.187
And what would you do
if you were us?

17:59.240 --> 18:01.401
I know what I'd do.

18:02.009 --> 18:04.034
And I know what you think
you gotta do.

18:05.413 --> 18:08.712
But I'm begging you.

18:09.050 --> 18:10.677
Please.

18:12.387 --> 18:14.116
Please.

18:15.157 --> 18:17.057
Leave her be.

18:22.531 --> 18:25.694
- So, what do you think?
- There's nothing to think about.

18:25.901 --> 18:28.769
We're not gonna leave Bobby
with the bride of Frankenstein.

18:28.938 --> 18:33.068
Then what do you wanna do? Walk in
in front of Bobby and blow her skull off?

18:33.443 --> 18:36.378
If she decides that Bobby's face
is the blue-plate special...

18:36.546 --> 18:38.241
...I'd like to be there.

18:40.149 --> 18:42.777
Fine. See what else we can find out.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.529
Oops. Did I scare you?

19:00.739 --> 19:02.206
No. No, no.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.808
There's nothing scary about you at all.

19:05.043 --> 19:06.806
Feel like some lunch?

19:07.879 --> 19:09.073
I'm good. Thanks.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.407
Come, there's more pie.

19:10.582 --> 19:12.777
I don't think
that Bobby wants me inside.

19:12.984 --> 19:15.146
Guess it'll have to be our secret then,
huh?

19:15.321 --> 19:16.720
Come on.

19:50.825 --> 19:53.316
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and guess you like pies.

19:53.528 --> 19:54.654
Did you bake all these?

19:54.829 --> 19:58.287
I don't know what it is.
Since I got back I can't stop baking.

19:58.466 --> 20:01.595
- When do you have time to sleep?
- I don't.

20:01.937 --> 20:03.234
Must be the excitement.

20:03.973 --> 20:05.133
Or being dead.

20:10.679 --> 20:13.204
- I know you don't trust me.
- Why would you say that?

20:13.382 --> 20:14.872
Come on, Dean.

20:15.117 --> 20:16.982
That's why you're here, isn't it?

20:18.021 --> 20:20.046
Keeping an eye on me.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.818
I know who you are.

20:25.395 --> 20:30.332
Just like I know Bobby's not the same
mild-mannered scrap dealer I married.

20:31.634 --> 20:33.694
You hunt things.

20:36.207 --> 20:39.199
I'm a thing. I get it.

20:40.511 --> 20:43.639
So you know Sam and I would never
let anything happen to Bobby.

20:43.848 --> 20:46.180
- He's like a father to us.
- I understand.

20:46.384 --> 20:48.318
And he's lucky to have you, Dean.

20:48.519 --> 20:50.545
But you're not the only one.

20:52.290 --> 20:53.917
Is that so?

20:57.996 --> 21:00.396
I remember everything, you know.

21:01.666 --> 21:02.928
When I died.

21:03.668 --> 21:05.569
That demon taking over my body.

21:06.873 --> 21:09.307
The things it made me do.

21:10.043 --> 21:12.807
And Bobby having no choice but to...

21:14.247 --> 21:16.215
Well, you know what he did.

21:18.584 --> 21:21.713
I can see it in his eyes
when he looks at me.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.755
The guilt.

21:25.459 --> 21:26.721
It weighs on him.

21:27.194 --> 21:29.719
So why don't you just tell him
you remember?

21:30.464 --> 21:32.193
Oh.

21:32.699 --> 21:36.534
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say you've never been in love.

21:37.639 --> 21:39.072
He's my husband.

21:39.274 --> 21:42.471
My job is to bring him peace.

21:43.111 --> 21:44.703
Not pain.

21:59.061 --> 22:01.222
Mrs. Jones?

22:17.013 --> 22:19.106
Ezra Jones?

22:40.606 --> 22:41.664
Um, Ezra Jones?

22:58.458 --> 23:00.289
What is it?

23:01.461 --> 23:03.520
You think maybe you could tell me
from here?

23:06.533 --> 23:09.969
Yeah. I'm gonna regret this. Whew.

24:05.796 --> 24:08.458
Keep your damn voices down.
Karen's upstairs.

24:08.632 --> 24:10.896
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're a little tense right now.

24:11.101 --> 24:13.400
- Who's old lady Jones?
- The first one to come up.

24:13.638 --> 24:16.471
- First one to go bad.
- Well, she was always a nutty broad.

24:16.641 --> 24:19.075
How? Like the way she ate
her husband's stomach?

24:19.244 --> 24:21.974
Was that the level of nutty
she was in life?

24:22.146 --> 24:23.613
No.

24:23.815 --> 24:25.874
Look, Bobby, I feel for you.

24:26.117 --> 24:29.087
But you've got to acknowledge
you're not seeing this straight.

24:29.255 --> 24:31.348
Admit it or not,
these things are turning.

24:31.523 --> 24:33.855
We have to stop them, all of them.

24:40.065 --> 24:41.726
- Time to go.
- What?

24:41.934 --> 24:43.765
You heard me. Off my property.

24:45.005 --> 24:46.700
Or what? You'll shoot?

24:46.906 --> 24:51.639
If Karen turns, I will handle it my way.

24:51.845 --> 24:52.903
This is dangerous.

24:55.715 --> 24:57.182
I'm not telling you twice.

25:17.439 --> 25:19.532
He's crazy.
- It's his wife, Dean.

25:19.741 --> 25:22.369
<i>So he goes Full Metal Jacket on us?
We're his family.</i>

25:22.577 --> 25:24.067
Look, man, bigger fish, okay?

25:24.246 --> 25:27.215
We got zombies about
to turn this town into a giant chew toy.

25:27.382 --> 25:29.373
Yeah,
and he's alone making pie with one.

25:29.584 --> 25:31.485
- All right, so?
- So?

25:32.989 --> 25:35.423
I'm gonna have to go back there
and kill her.

25:36.092 --> 25:39.823
- That's the only thing I can think of.
- Lf he sees you, you're a dead man.

25:40.063 --> 25:42.258
Well, then I guess
I won't let him see me.

25:43.599 --> 25:44.657
Okay.

25:44.834 --> 25:49.738
I'll head to town and rescue everyone.
Should be easy.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.099
Sounds like.

25:52.276 --> 25:53.573
I'm gonna need some help.

25:53.744 --> 25:57.145
What about the sheriff?
- Last time, the sheriff was pro-zombie.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.475
- I guess you'll have to convince her.
- How?

26:00.417 --> 26:02.578
I don't know. You're just gonna.

26:03.288 --> 26:06.155
There. Does that feel better, honey?

26:06.591 --> 26:08.252
I'm so hungry, Mommy.

26:08.860 --> 26:11.920
I know, I know.

26:12.530 --> 26:14.930
Mommy's gonna make you some soup,
okay?

26:15.100 --> 26:16.158
Okay.

26:16.334 --> 26:18.199
I don't know what else to tell you,
doc.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.271
We checked the thermometer
three times.

26:20.473 --> 26:23.033
His temperature is 111 degrees.

26:23.275 --> 26:25.835
Mommy, I'm hungry.
- Hold on, doc.

26:26.011 --> 26:27.842
Can you take that in to him?

26:31.650 --> 26:33.117
Dr. Dwight, it's Jody Mills.

26:40.127 --> 26:42.960
Karen, stay away from the windows.

26:44.364 --> 26:45.626
Karen?

26:48.769 --> 26:50.328
Karen?

26:54.575 --> 26:55.633
Karen?

26:58.479 --> 27:00.344
- I'm... I'm okay.
- Yeah?

27:00.548 --> 27:02.675
Okay. I just...

27:05.386 --> 27:08.720
I jus... I just got a bit dizzy.

27:11.059 --> 27:13.391
- You're burning up.
- Oh, I'm okay.

27:13.562 --> 27:16.929
I just need something to eat
and I'll be fine.

27:17.099 --> 27:18.726
Really.

27:24.707 --> 27:27.005
I don't know how to explain it,
doctor, that's...

27:27.177 --> 27:29.543
That's why we're calling you, l...

27:34.017 --> 27:35.609
Sean?

27:40.057 --> 27:41.684
Owen?

27:56.274 --> 27:58.139
Oh, my God.

28:16.229 --> 28:18.925
- Ah! No.
- Let's go, go.

28:20.766 --> 28:22.597
- But my husband...
- Leave it, he's dead.

28:22.768 --> 28:24.999
- That was not my son.
- You're right, it wasn't.

28:25.172 --> 28:26.867
Listen, your town is in danger.

28:27.074 --> 28:29.668
People are in danger
and we need to help them now.

28:29.877 --> 28:31.139
Can you do that for me?

28:31.311 --> 28:32.642
Can you focus for me, sheriff?

28:35.249 --> 28:36.511
Sheriff?

28:39.253 --> 28:41.620
- How do we put them down?
- Headshot.

28:49.430 --> 28:51.796
We're gonna need weapons.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.259
Start by rounding up
everybody we can find.

28:54.435 --> 28:57.462
Where is there a safe place
we can take people?

28:57.640 --> 28:59.198
Jail.

29:00.476 --> 29:02.000
All right.

29:03.679 --> 29:04.839
Just...

29:06.482 --> 29:07.972
Give me a minute.

29:39.317 --> 29:41.012
I'm so hungry, Bobby.

29:41.218 --> 29:43.653
I'll fix you something to eat
in a minute.

29:44.222 --> 29:46.156
I can feel it.

29:46.325 --> 29:48.190
- It's happening.
- Shh, shh, shh.

29:48.727 --> 29:50.217
It's gonna be all right.

29:50.829 --> 29:54.390
No, it's not.

29:54.566 --> 29:55.863
I'm turning, Bobby.

29:56.468 --> 29:58.960
You know I am.

30:08.748 --> 30:10.238
It's okay.

30:10.416 --> 30:11.610
- Do it.
- No way.

30:11.851 --> 30:13.876
- Please.
- No.

30:18.225 --> 30:20.489
I remember.

30:22.196 --> 30:23.390
You remember what?

30:24.865 --> 30:26.389
Everything.

30:28.202 --> 30:30.103
The demon inside me.

30:30.271 --> 30:31.738
You killing me.

30:33.108 --> 30:34.200
I remember.

30:35.276 --> 30:40.407
Then you know
why I can't do it again.

30:45.755 --> 30:47.916
There's something else too.

30:49.425 --> 30:53.156
When I came back, there was a man.

30:53.763 --> 30:55.390
What do you mean a man?

30:55.965 --> 30:57.159
At the grave.

30:57.833 --> 31:01.428
He was so thin, like a skeleton.

31:03.407 --> 31:06.103
He told me to give you a message.

31:06.309 --> 31:08.038
Me?

31:08.578 --> 31:10.739
Well,
why didn't you tell me this before?

31:12.616 --> 31:14.447
You've seen so much.

31:14.918 --> 31:16.749
I just...

31:18.156 --> 31:20.283
I just wanted to see you smile.

31:22.193 --> 31:24.286
What was the message?

31:45.851 --> 31:47.614
Bobby?

32:16.550 --> 32:19.144
If I hand you a gun
and you see a dead person...

32:19.320 --> 32:22.882
...I don't care if it's your friend,
your neighbor or your wife.

32:23.892 --> 32:25.985
Shoot for the head.
The only way we survive.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.993
Mind telling us who the hell you are?

32:29.197 --> 32:31.529
- Friend of Bobby Singer's.
- Town drunk?

32:34.169 --> 32:38.004
No, I thought he was the town drunk.

32:38.207 --> 32:39.231
Who told you that?

32:41.144 --> 32:42.168
Bobby Singer.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.341
Stay sharp.

32:46.716 --> 32:48.650
I'll watch the front door.

32:59.229 --> 33:01.959
You know, Bobby,
if you wanna sit this one out...

33:04.468 --> 33:06.095
Let's just get going.

33:56.958 --> 33:58.653
Dean?

33:59.126 --> 34:00.184
Dean.

34:19.514 --> 34:21.106
Dean?

34:51.547 --> 34:52.606
Dean.

35:09.134 --> 35:11.068
Little help here?

35:18.210 --> 35:19.700
Guns?
- Yeah, all right.

35:39.066 --> 35:41.364
- You got any more ammo? I'm low.
- We got plenty.

35:41.568 --> 35:44.059
Just run back past the zombies.
It's in the van.

35:44.271 --> 35:46.763
A no would've been fine.
What are they doing here?

35:47.275 --> 35:48.503
- I think I get it.
- What?

35:50.979 --> 35:52.844
Oh, that ain't good.

35:59.887 --> 36:01.116
- I'm out. Come on.
- Me too.

36:28.284 --> 36:30.252
Kind of a tight fit, don't you think?

36:30.420 --> 36:33.788
It's all right, they're idiots.
They can't pick a lock.

36:43.267 --> 36:45.565
Don't you ever get tired
of being wrong?

36:45.736 --> 36:47.762
I'm making this stuff up as I go.
Sue me.

37:00.085 --> 37:01.552
Get down.

37:34.188 --> 37:36.089
You okay?

37:57.480 --> 38:00.972
Well, if there's any zombies
left out there, we can't find them.

38:02.017 --> 38:04.918
How are the townspeople?
- Pretty freaked out.

38:05.488 --> 38:07.457
Hell, traumatized.

38:08.158 --> 38:09.989
A few of them are calling the papers.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.993
As far as I can tell,
nobody's believed them yet.

38:13.630 --> 38:15.257
Would you?

38:16.933 --> 38:18.025
How you holding up?

38:30.448 --> 38:31.915
Is that everyone?

38:34.485 --> 38:36.214
All but one.

38:57.977 --> 39:02.744
So thinking maybe I should apologize
for losing my head back there.

39:02.949 --> 39:04.541
Bobby...

39:06.319 --> 39:07.547
You don't owe us anything.

39:07.720 --> 39:11.714
Hey, look, I don't know squat
from Shinola about love...

39:12.526 --> 39:15.962
...but at least you got to spend
five days with her, right?

39:17.031 --> 39:18.555
Right.

39:19.033 --> 39:22.901
Which makes things
about a thousand times worse.

39:26.341 --> 39:28.366
She was the love of my life.

39:28.543 --> 39:31.034
How many times do I gotta kill her?

39:35.717 --> 39:37.844
You gonna be okay, Bobby?

39:44.427 --> 39:45.985
You boys should know.

39:47.930 --> 39:51.559
- Karen told me why Death was here.
- What do you mean?

39:51.767 --> 39:54.292
I know why he took a stroll
through a cemetery...

39:54.503 --> 39:57.200
...in the sticks of South Dakota.

39:58.508 --> 39:59.634
He came for me.

40:01.078 --> 40:04.809
- What do you mean you?
- Death came for me.

40:05.115 --> 40:08.744
He brought Karen back
to send me a message.

40:09.786 --> 40:10.878
You? Why you?

40:11.088 --> 40:13.614
Because I've been helping you,
you sons of bitches.

40:13.791 --> 40:17.659
I'm one of the reasons
you're still saying no to Lucifer, Sam.

40:19.797 --> 40:21.424
This was like a hit on your life?

40:21.599 --> 40:26.468
I don't know if they wanted
to take my life or my spirit.

40:27.339 --> 40:29.432
Either way,
they wanted me out of the way.

40:31.744 --> 40:33.803
But you're gonna be all right.

40:34.980 --> 40:37.039
Right, Bobby?

40:38.305 --> 40:44.339
