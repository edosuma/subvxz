00:10.741 --> 00:12.313
(Richard)
WHEN YOU BECOME AN INTERN,

00:12.313 --> 00:15.516
THERE'S A CEREMONY
WHERE YOU GET YOUR WHITE COAT.

00:15.516 --> 00:20.351
(indistinct conversations)

00:20.351 --> 00:23.594
(package rustles)

00:23.594 --> 00:26.627
LIKE MAGIC...

00:26.627 --> 00:28.159
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.236
(locker door slams)

00:35.236 --> 00:38.339
MY PARENTS CAME
TO MY WHITE COAT CEREMONY.

00:38.339 --> 00:42.313
I CAN STILL PICTURE THEM,
SO HAPPY...

00:42.313 --> 00:43.544
(baby fusses)
SO PROUD.

00:43.544 --> 00:48.119
HEY, WE NEED TO GET THE BOARD
TOGETHER, AND...

00:48.119 --> 00:50.681
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:55.526 --> 00:57.158
THEY SAY YOUR LIFE
FLASHES BEFORE YOUR EYES

00:57.158 --> 00:59.330
RIGHT BEFORE YOU DIE.

01:02.093 --> 01:03.464
THE IMPORTANT MOMENTS.

01:03.464 --> 01:07.238
(thunderclap)

01:07.238 --> 01:10.801
THE MOMENTS THAT TESTED YOU.

01:10.801 --> 01:12.243
THE MOMENTS THAT MADE YOU
WHO YOU ARE.

01:12.243 --> 01:15.206
APRIL,
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED.

01:15.206 --> 01:17.308
UNLESS I'M NOT.

01:17.308 --> 01:18.649
(curtain rings rattle)

01:18.649 --> 01:19.810
I JUST HEARD.

01:19.810 --> 01:22.253
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:22.253 --> 01:23.214
YEAH.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.288
(sniffles)

01:27.288 --> 01:30.261
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY LIFE
FLASHING BEFORE ME.

01:30.261 --> 01:33.164
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT MY WHITE COAT...

01:33.164 --> 01:35.826
AND HOW I'M GLAD
I HAVE IT ON ME NOW.

01:35.826 --> 01:39.330
UM, WILL YOU OVERHEAD PAGE
RICHARD WEBBER FOR ME?
RIGHT AWAY.

01:39.330 --> 01:42.133
IT'S THE MOMENT
MY LIFE STARTED.

01:42.133 --> 01:45.136
(electricity crackling
and popping)

01:47.408 --> 01:49.710
SEEMS FITTING IT SHOULD BE
ON ME WHEN IT ENDS.

01:49.710 --> 01:53.214
(water dripping)

01:53.214 --> 01:54.545
(woman over P.A.)
DR. RICHARD WEBBER,

01:54.545 --> 01:56.287
PLEASE CALL THE E.R.

01:56.287 --> 01:59.820
DR. RICHARD WEBBER,
PLEASE CALL THE E.R.

02:03.254 --> 02:06.327
(siren wailing in distance)

02:06.327 --> 02:09.600
OH, BABY'S SLEEPIN'.

02:09.600 --> 02:10.861
OH.
(camera shutter clicks)

02:10.861 --> 02:12.563
OKAY, WE SHOULD GET STARTED.

02:12.563 --> 02:15.866
UM, BAILEY, WE HAVE SOME BOARD
BUSINESS THAT WE NEED TO DISC--

02:15.866 --> 02:17.338
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

02:17.338 --> 02:20.241
ME AND THIS BABY GOT
BAILEY BUSINESS TO DISCUSS.

02:20.241 --> 02:23.474
DON'T WE? YES,
MR. DEREK BAILEY SHEPHERD.

02:23.474 --> 02:25.176
YES, WE DO.

02:25.176 --> 02:27.147
WHAT DOES ZOLA THINK OF HIM?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.180
OH, SHE WANTS TO TAKE HIM
TO DAY CARE FOR SHOW AND TELL.

02:29.180 --> 02:30.451
WHERE'S RICHARD?

02:30.451 --> 02:31.682
I PAGED
ALL THE BOARD MEMBERS.

02:31.682 --> 02:32.823
WELL, AVERY SHOULD
BE HERE, TOO.

02:32.823 --> 02:34.655
YEAH, WELL, HE WAS BEING
A HERO LAST NIGHT.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.857
HE DISLOCATED HIS SHOULDER
SAVING A KID FROM THE BUS CRASH.
(fusses)

02:36.857 --> 02:38.729
WHAT BUS CRASH?

02:38.729 --> 02:40.661
SHE HAD A BABY.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THINGS.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.832
(Meredith) SO TELL ME.

02:41.832 --> 02:43.264
(Derek) A CHURCH WAS
EVACUATING SOME PEOPLE,

02:43.264 --> 02:44.495
AND THEIR BUS OVERTURNED.

02:44.495 --> 02:45.696
(Owen) GOOD NEWS IS,
EVERYONE SURVIVED,

02:45.696 --> 02:46.937
AND THERE ARE
NO MAJOR INJURIES.

02:46.937 --> 02:48.899
AND THE BAD NEWS?
EVERYTHING ELSE.

02:48.899 --> 02:50.241
THE BLOOD BANK IS FLOODED,

02:50.241 --> 02:52.303
AND THE E.R. LOOKS LIKE
IT WAS RANSACKED.

02:52.303 --> 02:54.575
SO WE NEED TO CLOSE
THE E.R.?

02:54.575 --> 02:55.806
WE'RE DANGEROUSLY LOW
ON MEDS.

02:55.806 --> 02:57.508
PERSONNEL CAN'T MAKE IT IN
DUE TO THE FLOODING.

02:57.508 --> 02:59.350
SO WE NEED TO CLOSE THE E.R.

02:59.350 --> 03:00.411
CAN WE DO THAT?
BUT CAN WE DO THAT?

03:00.411 --> 03:01.812
YOU ARE THE BOARD.

03:01.812 --> 03:04.184
I AM TELLING YOU
THAT E.R. CANNOT OPEN TODAY.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.416
WHAT DO WE NEED?
I MEAN, I CAN

03:05.416 --> 03:07.888
TRY TO COORDINATE
WITH OUR SUPPLIERS.
(scoffs)

03:07.888 --> 03:09.760
I HAD A BABY. I'M NOT DEAD.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.262
IF THEY HAVE IT,
THEN WE WANT IT.
(fussing)

03:11.262 --> 03:12.493
IN THE MEANTIME,
LET'S MAKE SURE

03:12.493 --> 03:14.265
THAT OUR INPATIENTS
ARE TAKEN CARE OF

03:14.265 --> 03:15.796
AND DISCHARGE WHO WE CAN.

03:15.796 --> 03:16.967
LIKE ME.

03:16.967 --> 03:18.299
NO, YOU JUST HAD
A MAJOR ABDOMINAL SURGERY.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.601
YOU'RE GONNA STAY RIGHT HERE.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.303
ALL RIGHT,
AIRPORT'S JUST REOPENED.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.534
I JUST PUT
DR. BOSWELL IN A CAB.

03:23.534 --> 03:25.376
WHO'S DR. BOSWELL?
(sighs)

03:25.376 --> 03:27.838
SHE'S THE ONE
ARIZONA SLEPT WITH LAST NIGHT.

03:30.241 --> 03:32.983
(siren wailing in distance)

03:34.815 --> 03:36.417
(indistinct conversations)

03:36.417 --> 03:38.819
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WE'RE CLOSED
TO INCOMING TRAUMAS, GUYS.

03:38.819 --> 03:39.920
(April) THAT TO THEM.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.552
THERE WAS A MUDSLIDE
NEAR MADRONA.

03:41.552 --> 03:43.924
A BUNCH OF COPS AND FIREFIGHTERS
GOT HURT DOING EVACUATIONS.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.397
THERE ARE ALSO A BUNCH
OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES AS WELL.

03:46.397 --> 03:47.628
WHAT ABOUT SEATTLE PRES?

03:47.628 --> 03:49.300
THEY'RE WORSE OFF THAN WE ARE.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.001
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.
HELP ME GET THIS SLING OFF.

03:51.001 --> 03:52.833
GET ME EVERY SUTURE KIT,
LACERATION TRAY,

03:52.833 --> 03:55.536
FOLEY,
AND CHEST TUBE THAT YOU CAN.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.768
(man) WE'RE GONNA COME DOWN.
(woman) WE'RE SENDING
A TRIAGE DOWN.

03:57.768 --> 04:01.472
WHAT?
MY SHIFT IS OVER. I WAS GONNA
GO HOME AND GO TO SLEEP.

04:01.472 --> 04:03.874
I'M SO TIRED AND HUNGRY.

04:03.874 --> 04:06.717
MY TEETH HAVE STUFF
GROWING ON THEM, AND...

04:06.717 --> 04:09.249
(siren wailing in distance)
(gloves crackling)

04:09.249 --> 04:10.751
CAN YOU PRETEND YOU DIDN'T
HEAR ANY OF THAT?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.753
YEP. (sighs)

04:12.753 --> 04:14.254
(man) YEAH, YEAH.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.526
(April) COMING THROUGH.
STRAIGHT AHEAD.

04:15.526 --> 04:17.988
(panting)

04:19.490 --> 04:20.761
OH, WAIT, WAIT.

04:20.761 --> 04:21.932
WAIT.

04:21.932 --> 04:24.565
OKAY, I'M NOT DOING IT
IN AN ON CALL ROOM.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.837
I'M A GROWN-UP
WITH A HOUSE.

04:26.837 --> 04:28.268
YOUR HOUSE HAS A TREE
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

04:28.268 --> 04:32.042
(continues panting)

04:32.042 --> 04:33.504
(both chuckle)

04:33.504 --> 04:35.306
MM!

04:35.306 --> 04:37.648
WAIT, WAIT. DID YOU HAVE SEX
WITH LEAH IN HERE?

04:39.049 --> 04:40.681
AND HEATHER?

04:40.681 --> 04:44.885
OH, GOD. I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS.

04:44.885 --> 04:45.986
(exhales)

04:45.986 --> 04:47.358
YEAH, I CAN.

04:47.358 --> 04:50.821
(panting)

04:50.821 --> 04:52.363
(pager chimes)

04:52.363 --> 04:53.564
(sighs)

04:53.564 --> 04:56.327
NO. NO, NO, NO.

04:56.327 --> 04:57.698
I NEED THIS.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.730
WE'RE HERE. WE'RE READY.
LET'S JUST DO IT. TWO MINUTES.

04:59.730 --> 05:00.901
NO ONE'S GONNA DIE
IF WE DON'T ANSWER OUR PAGERS

05:00.901 --> 05:02.002
FOR TWO MINUTES, RIGHT?

05:02.002 --> 05:04.975
RIGHT.

05:04.975 --> 05:07.538
MM.

05:07.538 --> 05:08.609
CRAP!

05:08.609 --> 05:11.041
NOW I'M THINKING
ABOUT DEAD PEOPLE.

05:11.041 --> 05:13.584
(sighs)

05:13.584 --> 05:16.347
LENNY SHULTE,
CAPTAIN OF LADDER COMPANY 54.

05:16.347 --> 05:19.089
UNCONSCIOUS AT THE SCENE
WITH A G.C.S. OF 13.

05:19.089 --> 05:20.020
B.P.'s BEEN
CONSTANTLY DROPPING.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.922
LAST WAS 85 OVER 60.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.954
(wheezing, muffled voice)
I CAN'T... GET... A...

05:23.954 --> 05:25.095
A GOOD... BREATH.

05:25.095 --> 05:26.797
INCREASE HIS O2 TO 10 LITERS.

05:26.797 --> 05:28.459
CAN YOU TELL ME IF ANYTHING FELL
ON YOU, ON YOUR CHEST?

05:28.459 --> 05:30.701
I DON'T KNOW.

05:30.701 --> 05:34.064
LAST THING I REMEMBER, HELPING
THE OLD LADY OUT OF HER HOUSE.

05:34.064 --> 05:36.367
DID SH-SHE MAKE IT?
I'LL CHECK.

05:36.367 --> 05:38.769
5818 SHORE DRIVE.
AND MY GUYS--

05:38.769 --> 05:41.642
I-I GOT 12 GUYS OUT THERE.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.043
(coughing and spitting)

05:43.043 --> 05:45.716
TURN HIM. TURN HIM!

05:45.716 --> 05:48.919
(grunts) OKAY, LOOKS LIKE
HE ASPIRATED MUD.

05:48.919 --> 05:50.551
LET'S GET HIM
INTO TRAUMA ROOM ONE.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.783
LET'S GET A CHEST X-RAY
AND START HIM ON ANTIBIOTICS.

05:52.783 --> 05:54.785
LET'S GO!

05:54.785 --> 05:57.528
(man) GO. COMING THROUGH!
(wheels rolling)

05:59.960 --> 06:01.091
(sighs)

06:01.091 --> 06:04.435
OWEN AND I... (sighs)

06:04.435 --> 06:07.367
OH, YOU KNOW, I DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT.

06:09.039 --> 06:12.973
ENDED IT? BROKE UP?

06:12.973 --> 06:15.375
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA DIE.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.008
YOU ALWAYS END IT,
AND THEN YOU START IT AGAIN.

06:18.008 --> 06:20.080
YEAH, BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT.

06:21.952 --> 06:23.514
OKAY.

06:23.514 --> 06:25.786
OH, I'M GONNA GO TO SLEEP.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.058
OH, JUST FOR, LIKE,
20 MINUTES.

06:28.058 --> 06:29.460
OKAY.

06:29.460 --> 06:32.022
OH, ROBBINS CHEATING
ON CALLIE?

06:32.022 --> 06:34.465
OH!
DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

06:34.465 --> 06:35.626
I KNOW.
OH.

06:35.626 --> 06:37.598
AND "BAILEY" IS A GOOD NAME.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.801
BUT TWO BAILEYS? YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA BE CONFUSING?

06:40.801 --> 06:43.674
NO, BECAUSE... IF I SAY,
"BAILEY PEED ON ME,"

06:43.674 --> 06:47.007
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME
THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT MY SON.

06:47.007 --> 06:50.110
VERY GOOD. SERIOUSLY,
WAKE ME IN 20?

06:50.110 --> 06:53.143
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

06:53.143 --> 06:54.715
(pager chiming)

06:54.715 --> 06:57.117
(groans loudly)

06:57.117 --> 06:58.549
(sighs)

06:58.549 --> 07:01.151
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA DIE.

07:01.151 --> 07:03.423
DR. BENTLEY TO I.C.U.
ON 4 NORTH.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.795
SHEPHERD?

07:04.795 --> 07:06.657
YEAH, LYDIA ASHFORD. INJURIES
TO THE UPPER EXTREMITIES.

07:06.657 --> 07:07.958
MY HOUSE.

07:07.958 --> 07:09.460
AND SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT
HER HOUSE.

07:09.460 --> 07:11.101
WAIT.
UH, 5818 SHORE DRIVE?

07:11.101 --> 07:13.163
YES. IS IT GONE?
I DON'T KNOW.

07:13.163 --> 07:15.506
UH, KAREV,
KEPNER'S IN TRAUMA ONE.

07:15.506 --> 07:18.068
GET HER TO TELL HER PATIENT
5818 SHORE DRIVE MADE IT.

07:18.068 --> 07:19.069
KEPNER!

07:19.069 --> 07:21.041
TELL YOUR GUY 5818 IS OUT.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.073
I COULD'VE DONE THAT.

07:23.073 --> 07:25.445
I'M SORRY, BUT I NEED
A NEURO CONSULT IN BAY 7.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.077
THE GUY'S UNCONSCIOUS,
BUT HE'S STABLE.
OKAY.

07:27.077 --> 07:30.080
LOOK WHAT I FOUND
IN OUTPATIENT SURGERY.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.752
ROSS, STAY HERE.
I PAGED BROOKS.
(scribbles)

07:31.752 --> 07:34.054
HAVE HER GET MRS. ASHFORD
A PAN SCAN OF THE HEAD,

07:34.054 --> 07:35.626
NECK, CHEST, AND ABDOMEN.

07:35.626 --> 07:38.529
WELL, I CAN TAKE HER.
NO, HAVE BROOKS DO IT.

07:38.529 --> 07:41.061
(telephone ringing)
UH, THE MAYOR'S ON THE PHONE.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.033
WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT CASUALTIES
FROM THE MUDSLIDE.

07:43.033 --> 07:44.464
I TOLD HIM
IT WAS SOON TO TELL,

07:44.464 --> 07:45.766
BUT HE WANTS TO HEAR IT
FROM YOU.

07:45.766 --> 07:47.037
OKAY.

07:47.037 --> 07:50.571
(indistinct conversations)

07:50.571 --> 07:51.872
(telephone rings)

07:53.574 --> 07:55.546
HEY, UM,
GO FIND DR. WEBBER.

07:55.546 --> 07:57.578
I'M SUPPOSED TO GIVE DR. BROOKS
A MESSAGE FROM DR. SHEPHERD.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.009
UH,
IS THAT LIFE-THREATENING?

07:59.009 --> 08:01.481
BECAUSE NOT HAVING
ENOUGH GENERAL SURGEONS

08:01.481 --> 08:03.614
IN HERE RIGHT NOW
IS LIFE-THREATENING.

08:03.614 --> 08:05.485
GO FIND WEBBER.

08:12.623 --> 08:13.864
OH!

08:13.864 --> 08:15.495
HAVE YOU SEEN DR. WEBBER?

08:15.495 --> 08:16.727
UH, LAST TIME I SAW HIM
WAS AFTER SURGERY.

08:16.727 --> 08:18.168
HE WENT TO GO CHECK
ON THE GENERATOR.

08:18.168 --> 08:19.099
WHERE'S THAT?

08:19.099 --> 08:20.731
HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW?

08:22.673 --> 08:25.035
LIDOCAINE AND A BUNCH OF 4X4s.
CAN YOU TAKE THAT TO HUNT?

08:25.035 --> 08:26.206
I GOT PAGED BY SHEPHERD.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.879
UH... HE WANTS YOU
TO GO FIND WEBBER.

08:28.879 --> 08:31.982
ARE YOU SURE?
HE JUST PAGED ME 9-1-2.

08:31.982 --> 08:33.143
THAT'S
OUR SPECIAL LITTLE CODE.

08:33.143 --> 08:35.515
IT MEANS MORE EMERGENT
THAN 9-1-1. GET IT?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.117
ALL I KNOW IS
THEY NEED WEBBER HERE,

08:37.117 --> 08:38.719
AND SHEPHERD WANTS YOU
TO GET HIM.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.151
APPARENTLY, HE WENT TO DEAL
WITH THE GENERATOR.

08:48.899 --> 08:52.302
(exhaling)

08:52.302 --> 08:54.765
(inhales sharply)
AND I'M WALKING TOWARD THE CAR,

08:54.765 --> 08:57.107
AND SUDDENLY THE HILLSIDE
JUST GOES...

08:57.107 --> 08:59.039
AND I'M FALLING.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.841
I SEE MY SQUAD CAR
COMING DOWN ON TOP OF ME,

09:00.841 --> 09:02.242
SO I MANAGED TO ROLL OUT
OF THE WAY,

09:02.242 --> 09:04.875
BUT MY... MY LEG
WAS CAUGHT UNDER IT.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.076
(inhales sharply)

09:06.076 --> 09:08.749
(grunts)
CAN YOU SALVAGE IT?

09:08.749 --> 09:09.980
I THINK SO.
WE'LL GET ORTHO DOWN HERE.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.181
I'M GONNA TAKE A LOOK

09:11.181 --> 09:12.653
AT THAT NASTY LACERATION
ON YOUR NECK, THOUGH.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.224
IT'S A LOT
OF EMBEDDED DEBRIS.

09:14.224 --> 09:15.626
(exhales)

09:15.626 --> 09:19.259
HEY, TILDEN? EVERYONE MAKE IT
OUT OF THE MUD?

09:19.259 --> 09:21.561
EVERYONE'S ACCOUNTED FOR

09:21.561 --> 09:24.795
EXCEPT LAUENSTEIN, PHIL G.,
AND... BRIAN.

09:26.837 --> 09:28.138
BRIAN'S MY FIANCé.

09:28.138 --> 09:30.971
DON'T WORRY. YOU KNOW HIM.
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.103
LOOK, HE'S PROBABLY
GIVING HIMSELF A MUD FACIAL.

09:33.103 --> 09:35.075
YOU KNOW, LOOK GOOD
FOR THE WEDDING.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.306
YEAH, WELL,
IF HE HAD COLD FEET,

09:36.306 --> 09:38.108
HE SHOULDA JUST SAID SO.

09:38.108 --> 09:39.349
(chuckles)

09:39.349 --> 09:42.152
(grunts)

09:42.152 --> 09:43.183
OKAY.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.589
DR. WEBBER?

09:49.589 --> 09:50.721
(door closes)

09:50.721 --> 09:52.322
(electricity crackling)

09:52.322 --> 09:54.224
DR. WEBBER!

09:54.224 --> 09:57.067
(electricity continues
crackling and popping)

09:57.067 --> 10:00.170
OH, CRAP. DR. WEBBER!

10:03.874 --> 10:07.077
(electricity crackles)

10:07.077 --> 10:08.709
(thud)

10:10.941 --> 10:12.943
(crackles)

10:26.697 --> 10:27.698
OSCAR HALLIS. SHEPHERD SAYS
HE'S PROBABLY CONCUSSED.

10:27.698 --> 10:28.759
WE'RE GONNA DO A HEAD C.T.

10:28.759 --> 10:30.100
I'M MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT INFECTION.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.361
THAT IS A NASTY CUT ON HIS LEG.

10:31.361 --> 10:33.263
WELL, DR. WILSON'S IRRIGATING IT
WITH SALINE.

10:33.263 --> 10:34.765
BUT WE COULDN'T FIND
ANY BACITRACIN.

10:34.765 --> 10:36.837
WE'RE GONNA HANG
SOME AMPICILLIN.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.369
NO AMPICILLIN!
HE'S ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN.
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

10:39.369 --> 10:41.041
(sighs)

10:41.041 --> 10:42.773
WHAT THE HELL?

10:42.773 --> 10:45.916
MILITARY TRICK.

10:45.916 --> 10:47.918
SOMEONE
TRIAGED HIM AT THE SCENE--

10:47.918 --> 10:50.821
PROBABLY WHOEVER DUG HIM OUT.
SUBSTITUTE CEFAZOLIN

10:50.821 --> 10:52.753
AND KEEP A CLOSE EYE
FOR ALLERGIC REACTION.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.424
ALL RIGHT.
GET SOME CEFAZOLIN.

10:54.424 --> 10:55.856
WE DON'T HAVE IT.
WELL, FIND IT.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.988
PEOPLE, CHECK YOUR PATIENTS
FOR VITALS

10:57.988 --> 11:00.030
WRITTEN IN SHARPIE
ON THEIR BODY.

11:00.030 --> 11:02.332
SOMEONE AT THE SCENE
KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

11:02.332 --> 11:05.665
(sighs) MIGHT'VE JUST SAVED
THIS GUY'S LIFE.

11:07.037 --> 11:10.040
OH. SHARPIE HERE, TOO.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.342
AND IT INDICATES
HE'S GETTING WORSE FAST.

11:12.342 --> 11:13.774
HIS B.P. WAS BETTER
IN THE FIELD. CRAP.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.706
OKAY, WE NEED TO STABILIZE
HIS PELVIS.

11:15.706 --> 11:17.878
(indistinct conversations,
equipment beeping)

11:17.878 --> 11:19.449
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO PULL HARDER.

11:19.449 --> 11:20.981
TALK TO ME, MURPHY.
(gloves snapping)

11:20.981 --> 11:23.153
AARON GARCIA. C.T. SHOWED
AN OPEN BOOK PELVIC FRACTURE

11:23.153 --> 11:24.384
ON A LIVER LAC WITH HEMORRHAGE.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.956
HARDER, MURPHY.

11:25.956 --> 11:27.157
I'M AFRAID IF I PULL TOO HARD,
I'M GONNA MAKE IT WORSE.

11:27.157 --> 11:29.119
(sighs) YOU CAN'T--MOVE.
CAN'T MAKE IT WORSE.

11:29.119 --> 11:32.222
IT'S ALREADY
AS BAD AS IT CAN BE. (grunts)

11:32.222 --> 11:34.224
ALL RIGHT, I NEED TO GET
THIS GUY UPSTAIRS

11:34.224 --> 11:35.726
AND PUT ON AN EX FIX
IMMEDIATELY.

11:35.726 --> 11:37.798
MURPHY, BOOK AN O.R.
AND ASK BAILEY TO SCRUB IN.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.229
WHAT DO YOU NEED
BAILEY FOR?

11:39.229 --> 11:40.871
HE HAS A LIVER LAC.
I NEED A GENERAL SURGEON.

11:40.871 --> 11:42.873
WELL, I'M A GENERAL SURGEON,
AND IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK--

11:42.873 --> 11:45.035
GET ME BAILEY!

11:45.035 --> 11:46.907
(indistinct conversations)

11:46.907 --> 11:49.139

DR. MAHONEY...

11:49.139 --> 11:50.180
DO YOU HAVE CEFAZOLIN?

11:50.180 --> 11:51.411
YEAH, THEY WERE HOARDING IT
IN O.B.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.712
BASTARDS. GIVE ME SOME.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.045
AHH! I'LL TRADE YOU
FOR A CHEST TUBE.

11:55.045 --> 11:56.817
AND A GRANOLA BAR.

11:56.817 --> 11:57.918
I DON'T HAVE A GRANOLA BAR.
LIAR.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.389
YOU'VE GOT
GRANOLA BAR BREATH.

11:59.389 --> 12:00.390
DO YOU WANT THE CEF?

12:00.390 --> 12:01.922
FINE!
YEAH.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.394
WHAT IS GOING ON OUT THERE?
HUGE MUDSLIDE. GOTTA GO.

12:04.394 --> 12:06.726
LOT OF CRUSH INJURIES.
SUPER CUTE BABY.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.459
(elevator bell dings)
I THOUGHT THE E.R. WAS CLOSED!

12:09.459 --> 12:11.001
WHERE'S BROOKS?

12:11.001 --> 12:12.863
UH, SHE WAS BUSY, SO I WENT
AHEAD AND DID THE SCAN.

12:12.863 --> 12:14.965
IT SHOWS A SMALL
SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE.

12:14.965 --> 12:16.006
HER EXAM?

12:16.006 --> 12:17.237
UH, NEURO CHECKS
HAVE BEEN STABLE.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.338
ALL RIGHT, TELL BROOKS
I WANT HER TO CONTINUE ON

12:18.338 --> 12:19.870
WITH Q 1 HOUR NEURO CHECKS.
BUT--

12:19.870 --> 12:21.341
DON'T ARGUE WITH ME.
JUST FIND BROOKS.
YES, SIR.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.814
MRS. ASHFORD,
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

12:23.814 --> 12:25.876
MY HOUSE.

12:25.876 --> 12:28.048

12:35.886 --> 12:37.828
OKAY, I NEED YOU

12:37.828 --> 12:39.860
CROWN MOLDING

12:39.860 --> 12:41.091
OKAY.

12:41.091 --> 12:42.432
(panting)

12:42.432 --> 12:44.434
OKAY. HOW'S HE DOING?

12:44.434 --> 12:45.836
CAPTAIN SHULTE HAS
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS

12:45.836 --> 12:47.397
ON THE RIGHT,
WORSENING TACHYPNEA

12:47.397 --> 12:48.939
AND PERSISTENT SATS IN THE 80s.

12:48.939 --> 12:50.941
TOOK ME FOREVER
TO FIND A CHEST TUBE.

12:50.941 --> 12:52.542
(panting) I NEED A-A LIST.

12:52.542 --> 12:55.105
WHO--WHO'S STILL MISSING?

12:55.105 --> 12:57.147
OKAY, LENNY,

12:57.147 --> 12:58.508
PREVENTING YOU

12:58.508 --> 12:59.910
SO WE'RE GONNA INSERT
A CHEST TUBE

12:59.910 --> 13:01.051
WHICH SHOULD HELP YOU
BREATHE BETTER.

13:01.051 --> 13:02.953
IS THERE ANYONE
THAT WE CAN CALL FOR YOU?

13:02.953 --> 13:05.555
MM. CALL... (panting)
CALL MARLA, BUT...

13:05.555 --> 13:08.288
DON'T--DON'T LET HER
COME UP HERE. ROAD'S NOT SAFE.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.920

ALL RIGHT.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.962
OKAY. COME ON.
HANG IN THERE, LENNY.

13:11.962 --> 13:14.064
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA FEEL

(snip)

13:21.872 --> 13:24.474
(monitor beeping steadily)

13:27.838 --> 13:30.110
OH! OH, GOD,

13:30.110 --> 13:32.312
OH.
OH, JEEZ.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.484
I'M SORRY, SWEETHEART.
THE TUBE IS IN A GOOD POSITION.

13:34.484 --> 13:36.046
I SUSPECT
A DIAPHRAGMATIC RUPTURE.

13:36.046 --> 13:38.148
LENNY, LENNY, I BELIEVE
YOUR COLON HAS BEEN PUSHED UP

13:38.148 --> 13:39.850
INTO YOUR CHEST.

13:39.850 --> 13:42.052
NOW THE RISK OF INFECTION
IS EXTREMELY HIGH.

13:42.052 --> 13:43.994
NOW IF I'M RIGHT,
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO OPEN YOU UP.

13:43.994 --> 13:45.025

14:14.584 --> 14:16.486
WHILE HE GOES UP

14:16.486 --> 14:19.089
TELL DR. HUNT I'M ABOUT

14:19.089 --> 14:21.061

BROKEN PELVIS,

14:21.061 --> 14:22.963
SO I CAN'T MAN THE E.R.
WHERE'S DR. WEBBER?

14:22.963 --> 14:26.036
I DON'T KNOW.

14:26.036 --> 14:27.397
OKAY, WELL, FIND HIM, PL--

14:27.397 --> 14:31.902

(electricity crackling)

14:46.586 --> 14:48.919
(man) COMING THROUGH!

14:50.020 --> 14:51.962
WEBBER'S PULSE IS THREADY.

14:51.962 --> 14:56.166
SYSTOLIC'S 80.
BROOKS HAS MASSIVE HEAD TRAUMA.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.268
PUPILS ARE UNRESPONSIVE.

14:58.268 --> 15:00.670
(monitor beeping erratically)

15:00.670 --> 15:02.102
LET'S GET HER ON HER SIDE.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.604

15:32.432 --> 15:33.964
I KNOW YOU GUYS
ARE FREAKED OUT,

15:33.964 --> 15:35.935
BUT WE HAVE PATIENTS,
SO YOU NEED TO FOCUS.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.937
FIGURE OUT WHO ROSS AND BROOKS
WERE COVERING.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.710
UH, ROSS WAS DOING NEURO CHECKS
ON CROWN MOLDING...
NO BREATH SOUNDS.

15:40.710 --> 15:42.212
SO I CAN TAKE OVER THOSE.

15:42.212 --> 15:43.513
ALLERGIC GUY IS AWAKE,

15:43.513 --> 15:45.045
AND HIS HEAD C.T.
CAME BACK CLEAR.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.646
LAST TIME I CHECKED HIS B.P.,
IT WAS GOOD, LIKE, UH,

15:46.646 --> 15:50.250

I WROTE IT DOWN SOMEWHERE.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.451
WHAT THE HELL?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.483
WELL, THE ELECTRONIC CHARTS
ARE STILL DOWN,

15:53.483 --> 15:55.525
SO I'M WINGING IT.

16:18.008 --> 16:20.410
OUR ELECTRONIC CHARTS
ARE DOWN.

16:20.410 --> 16:22.552
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
A TEMPORARY TATTOO.
GO FOR IT, DOC.

16:22.552 --> 16:24.154
I ALREADY GOT ONE.

16:24.154 --> 16:26.486
(telephone ringing in distance)

16:29.019 --> 16:33.423
(wheels rolling)

16:33.423 --> 16:35.465
(man) I'M GONNA SCRUB IN.
THEY WANNA TAKE ME BACK.

16:35.465 --> 16:36.666

16:39.599 --> 16:42.232
LOOK, I KNOW
HEATHER'S A FRIEND,

16:53.443 --> 16:56.316
(door slides open)

16:56.316 --> 16:58.118
(door slides closed)

16:58.118 --> 17:01.521
I KNOW THAT YOU WANTED BAILEY,
BUT SHE'S WORKING ON RICHARD.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.093
(door closes)

17:03.093 --> 17:05.195
(sighs)
CALLIE, WE SHOULD--

17:05.195 --> 17:06.526
SHOULD WHAT?

17:06.526 --> 17:08.498
NOT SLEEP WITH OTHER PEOPLE?
RESPECT OUR WEDDING VOWS?

17:08.498 --> 17:10.660
WE SHOULD PUT OUR PROBLEMS
ASIDE RIGHT NOW,

17:10.660 --> 17:13.403
BECAUSE THIS GUY DESERVES THAT.
(scoffs)

17:23.243 --> 17:26.316
WELL, THANK GOD
YOU FOUND THEM, ROSS.

17:26.316 --> 17:30.080
LET'S JUST HOPE

17:30.080 --> 17:32.482

17:34.084 --> 17:37.087
OH, GOD.

17:37.087 --> 17:38.728

17:49.699 --> 17:51.541
OKAY, UH, TROPONIN?

17:51.541 --> 17:52.742
ELEVATED AT 4.

17:52.742 --> 17:54.744
HMM. CRIT?
FINE AT 40.

17:54.744 --> 17:57.777
POTASSIUM'S 4.5. BICARB 18.
EVERYTHING ELSE IS NORMAL.

17:57.777 --> 18:01.211
LACTATE.
2.

18:01.211 --> 18:03.653
NO, THAT--THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.
HE SHOULD BE ACIDOTIC.

18:03.653 --> 18:06.416
HIS GIRTH IS INCREASING
AS WE STAND HERE.
LOOK, IT SAYS--

18:06.416 --> 18:08.158
I KNOW WHAT IT SAYS,
BUT IT'S WRONG.

18:08.158 --> 18:10.360
REDO IT.

18:12.562 --> 18:15.395
(monitor beeping erratically)

18:15.395 --> 18:17.627
ALL RIGHT, UH,
CHARGE AGAIN TO 200.

18:17.627 --> 18:19.129
(whines)

18:19.129 --> 18:20.230
CLEAR.

18:20.230 --> 18:22.502
KAREV? WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH RICHARD?

18:22.502 --> 18:24.234
UH, ECHO SHOWS
VERY LITTLE HEART ACTIVITY,

18:24.234 --> 18:25.735
AND C.V.P.'s ELEVATED.

18:25.735 --> 18:27.637
YANG'S ABOUT TO SET UP
FOR A BALLOON PUMP.

18:27.637 --> 18:29.439
ALL RIGHT, WELL, IF WE'RE
SENDING HIM UP TO SURGERY,

18:29.439 --> 18:31.141
LET'S MAKE SURE WE HAVE
AN ADEQUATE BLOOD SUPPLY

18:31.141 --> 18:32.412
FOR TRANSFUSION.
ON IT.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.184
IF--IF YOU NEED TO GO DEAL
WITH MORE DIRE PATIENTS,

18:34.184 --> 18:36.186
I GET IT. GO. I'M FINE.

18:36.186 --> 18:38.418
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE NOT, SASHA.
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

18:38.418 --> 18:39.549
GO AHEAD AND DEBRIDE
AND CLEAN OUT THIS WOUND

18:39.549 --> 18:42.652
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
TO PREVENT INFECTION.

18:42.652 --> 18:44.894
SASHA...
ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
WALKING AROUND IN THAT THING?

18:44.894 --> 18:46.426
I CAN'T SIT STILL.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.127
I'M WAITING ON PLASTIC SURGERY
TO SEW ME UP.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.529
THAT'S THIS GUY.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.131
YOU MIND IF I, UH,
IF I SIT HERE?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.533
(sighs)

18:55.805 --> 18:57.507
(groans)

18:57.507 --> 19:00.540
THAT KINDA LOOKS LIKE
BRIAN'S HANDWRITING.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.812
YEAH, I KNOW. MY GLASSES
GOT KNOCKED OFF IN THE SLIDE.

19:02.812 --> 19:05.845
I COULD BARELY SEE A THING,
BUT IT COULD'VE BEEN.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.217
BUT WAS IT HIS VOICE?

19:07.217 --> 19:08.878
I CAN'T REMEMBER.
I'M SORRY, SASH.

19:08.878 --> 19:11.581
I WAS KINDA OUT OF IT,
YOU KNOW?

19:11.581 --> 19:13.253
(gasps)
I'M SORRY.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.854
JUST A LITTLE DISCOLORATION
IN THE TISSUE.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.326
I'D LIKE TO RUN A FEW TESTS

19:16.326 --> 19:18.188
JUST TO MAKE SURE
THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

19:18.188 --> 19:21.731
I'M JUST GONNA NUMB YOU UP,
OKAY?

19:21.731 --> 19:23.463
(whispers) YEAH. GO AHEAD.

19:24.634 --> 19:27.397
(normal voice) I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT'S HIS WRITING.

19:27.397 --> 19:29.539
WE NEED BLOOD, MER. THERE'S NO
TIME TO SCREEN, TYPE, OR CROSS.

19:29.539 --> 19:31.641
ALL RIGHT?
I NEED ALL THE O-NEG I CAN GET.

19:31.641 --> 19:33.473
OKAY, BUT WAIT.
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:33.473 --> 19:35.505
AND STAFF. LAB TECHS,
SCRUB NURSES.

19:35.505 --> 19:36.646
I NEED E.T.A.s ON WHEN
YOU CAN GET PEOPLE IN HERE.
(fusses)

19:36.646 --> 19:37.807
PAGE ME WHEN YOU CAN.

19:37.807 --> 19:39.349
ALEX, PICK UP THE BABY.

19:39.349 --> 19:40.510
MER, I DON'T HAVE TIME.

19:40.510 --> 19:43.483
ALEX.
PICK UP MY BABY.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.785
(baby fusses)

19:45.785 --> 19:48.258
(sighs)

19:48.258 --> 19:51.261
(continues fussing)

19:54.324 --> 19:56.566
NO, THE BABY IS FOR YOU,

19:56.566 --> 19:59.469
SO THAT YOU CAN STOP
FREAKING OUT.

19:59.469 --> 20:03.873
NOW JUST RELAX AND TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

20:03.873 --> 20:05.935
(telephone rings)

20:05.935 --> 20:09.208
WEBBER AND BROOKS ARE DOWN.
THEY WERE ELECTROCUTED.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.282
IT'S BAD, BUT WE'RE--WE'RE--
WE'RE--WE'RE DEALING WITH IT.

20:12.282 --> 20:13.483
I JUST NEED YOU TO GET
ON THE PHONE

20:13.483 --> 20:15.385
AND HELP US
GET THOSE SUPPLIES, OKAY?

20:15.385 --> 20:17.487
OKAY. OKAY.

20:17.487 --> 20:18.618
HERE.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.490
YOUR TURN NOT TO FREAK OUT.

20:23.853 --> 20:25.355
OKAY, FORCEPS.
METZ.

20:25.355 --> 20:27.997
I HAVE A STATUS UPDATE
ON DR. WEBBER.
OKAY.

20:27.997 --> 20:29.659
DR. YANG IS ATTEMPTING
TO PLACE A BALLOON PUMP,

20:29.659 --> 20:30.900
BUT HE KEEPS CODING.

20:30.900 --> 20:33.903
SHE'S PLACING ONE BEDSIDE
WITHOUT FLUORO?

20:33.903 --> 20:35.905
SHE COULD RUPTURE HIS AORTA.

20:35.905 --> 20:37.567
DO YOU WANT ME TO GET DR. YANG
ON THE PHONE?

20:37.567 --> 20:38.968
YOU JUST SAID SHE'S THREADING
A BALLOON PUMP.

20:38.968 --> 20:40.370
SHE IS, BUT--
THEN HOW IS SHE GONNA TALK
ON THE PHONE?

20:40.370 --> 20:41.371
I DIDN'T... MEAN--

20:41.371 --> 20:43.573
RETRACT HER.
OH, NO.

20:43.573 --> 20:45.575
NO, NO, NO.
OKAY, LET'S RUN THE BOWEL.

20:45.575 --> 20:47.917
THE ABDOMEN'S
FULLY CONTAMINATED.
JUST RUN THE BOWEL.

20:47.917 --> 20:49.479
WE'RE GONNA RESECT THIS
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

20:49.479 --> 20:51.951
LET'S GET READY
TO PACK HIM.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.583
COME ON, LENNY.

20:53.583 --> 20:57.487
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

21:00.390 --> 21:02.031
IT'S TOO QUIET.

21:02.031 --> 21:03.433
TALK.

21:07.036 --> 21:09.439
Y-YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

21:09.439 --> 21:14.504
YOU... ARE NOT GOING TO
RUPTURE THE AORTA

21:14.504 --> 21:17.947
BECAUSE YOU...
ARE CRISTINA YANG.

21:17.947 --> 21:20.710
ATTACH THIS TO THE CONSOLE.

21:20.710 --> 21:23.913
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
YOU ARE THE STAR
OF YOUR CLASS.

21:23.913 --> 21:28.558
I ALWAYS KNEW IT.
I SAID IT TO ANYONE WHO'D ASK--

21:28.558 --> 21:33.523
"LOOK OUT FOR CRISTINA YANG."
I-I SAID IT TO WEBBER.

21:33.523 --> 21:35.595
(voice breaking)
"CRISTINA YANG IS GOOD.

21:35.595 --> 21:39.469
"CRISTINA YANG WOULD NOT
RUPTURE AN AORTA.

21:39.469 --> 21:41.471
CRISTINA YA--"

21:41.471 --> 21:43.973
(beeping steadily)

21:43.973 --> 21:47.306
OH, GOD, YOU DID IT.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.979
(steady beeping continues)

21:49.979 --> 21:53.343
OH, DEAR LORD.
HE HAS A STEADY HEARTBEAT.

21:53.343 --> 21:57.517
(crying) OH, PRAISE JESUS.
YOU DIDN'T RUPTURE HIS AORTA.

21:57.517 --> 22:00.319
SECURE THIS DEVICE
AND GET HIM UP TO THE I.C.U.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.851
WE JUST BOUGHT HIM SOME TIME.

22:01.851 --> 22:04.394
(breathing heavily)

22:04.394 --> 22:05.655
OH.

22:05.655 --> 22:07.997
HUG ME BACK,
CRISTINA YANG.

22:07.997 --> 22:10.460
I KNOW YOU ARE NOT A HUGGER,
BUT RIGHT NOW

22:10.460 --> 22:14.504
I NEED YOU TO HUG ME BACK.

22:16.506 --> 22:18.037
(cries)

22:18.037 --> 22:19.609
(exhales deeply)

22:24.544 --> 22:26.576
HEY, MRS. ASHFORD.

22:26.576 --> 22:28.578
DID YOU FIND OUT?

22:28.578 --> 22:30.019
PRESS AGAINST MY HANDS
WITH THE BOTTOMS OF YOUR FEET.

22:30.019 --> 22:31.381
FIND OUT WHAT?

22:31.381 --> 22:32.552
ABOUT MY HOUSE.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.824
IT HAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
CROWN MOLDINGS.

22:34.824 --> 22:36.355
NOW WITH YOUR HANDS.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.828
I'M SORRY. I HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO ASK ABOUT YOUR HOUSE.

22:38.828 --> 22:39.829
HOW'S YOUR VISION?

22:39.829 --> 22:41.731
ANY BLURRINESS?
MY VISION?

22:41.731 --> 22:43.893
(click)
I DON'T CARE ABOUT MY--

22:43.893 --> 22:45.064
S-STOP.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.766
STOP THIS NONSENSE.

22:46.766 --> 22:50.470
JUST CALL SOMEBODY, PLEASE.
FIND OUT ABOUT MY HOUSE.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.472
MA'AM, THIS ISN'T NONSENSE.
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU,

22:52.472 --> 22:53.943
AND I HAVE ABOUT
20 OTHER PATIENTS,

22:53.943 --> 22:55.405
SO CHECKING ON YOUR HOUSE
IS THE LAST THING

22:55.405 --> 22:57.006
ON MY MIND RIGHT NOW.
PEOPLE GOT INJURED BADLY,

22:57.006 --> 22:59.509
SO YOU NEED TO STOP
WORRYING ABOUT YOUR HOUSE,

22:59.509 --> 23:02.051
AND YOU NEED TO TELL ME
IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING

23:02.051 --> 23:04.954
ANY BLURRINESS OF VISION.

23:08.918 --> 23:11.020
HIS LACTATE IS 6.

23:11.020 --> 23:11.921
6?

23:13.823 --> 23:16.826
(monitor beeping steadily)

23:20.930 --> 23:24.934
UH, HE HAS AN ACUTE ABDOMEN.
GET ME AN O.R. AND A GOOD STAFF.

23:24.934 --> 23:26.836
I'LL TAKE, UH, LINDA,
IF SHE'S AVAILABLE. NORMAN.

23:26.836 --> 23:28.578
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
NORMAN'S M.I.A.

23:28.578 --> 23:31.010
OKAY, ANNA, THEN.
I'LL MAKE SOME PHONE CALLS.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.682
YOU'RE NOT OPENING HIM UP.

23:32.682 --> 23:34.043
THE ELECTRICAL INJURY

23:34.043 --> 23:36.816
MAY HAVE CAUSED
INTRA-ABDOMINAL TISSUE DAMAGE

23:36.816 --> 23:38.988
AND LIKELY PROGRESSING
BECAUSE OF HIS HEART FAILING.

23:38.988 --> 23:41.050
HE BARELY TOLERATED
THE BALLOON PUMP.

23:41.050 --> 23:43.122
I NEED TO GET IN THERE
AND DEBRIDE THE DEAD TISSUE.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.625
THERE'S NO WAY HIS HEART
CAN HANDLE THE ANESTHESIA.

23:45.625 --> 23:46.796
HIS LACTATE IS 6.

23:46.796 --> 23:48.698
HE NEEDS
SUSTAINED CARDIAC I.C.U.

23:48.698 --> 23:50.500
HE'S GONNA DIE IF WE DON'T
DO ANYTHING.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.761
WE'RE NOT DOING NOTHING.

23:51.761 --> 23:53.903
WE'RE GONNA LET
THE BALLOON PUMP WORK..

23:53.903 --> 23:56.135
I AM THE ATTENDING...
AND KEEP HIS FLUIDS TIGHT.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.908
YOU ARE A FELLOW.
I MAKE THE DECISIONS HERE.

23:58.908 --> 24:01.911
WELL, I OWN THIS HOSPITAL.
YOU WORK FOR ME.

24:04.474 --> 24:05.975
HE'S BLEEDING
THROUGH THE PACKING,

24:05.975 --> 24:07.617
AND THERE'S STILL STOOL
COMING OUT.

24:07.617 --> 24:09.749
DAMN IT. WE NEED TO TAKE IT OUT
AND RESECT MORE INTESTINES.

24:09.749 --> 24:10.880
HOW'S HIS I.N.R.?

24:10.880 --> 24:12.151
THE LAST ONE WAS 6.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.654
OKAY, GIVE HIM FACTOR VII,
F.F.P.s AND PLATELETS.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.956
FASTER, KEPNER.
HE'S HAVING ARRHYTHMIAS.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.529
TALK TO ME.
UH... I CAN'T GET A PULSE.

24:19.529 --> 24:20.960
(monitor beeping rapidly)
I THINK HE'S IN P.E.A.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.461
STARTING COMPRESSIONS.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.033
(grunts)

24:24.033 --> 24:25.935
(hands scrubbing)
(Derek)
I KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT,

24:25.935 --> 24:27.897
BUT BROOKS IS OUR PATIENT.
I'M TELLING YOU THIS

24:27.897 --> 24:31.200
TO REMIND YOU TO BE HER DOCTOR,
NOT HER FRIEND RIGHT NOW.

24:31.200 --> 24:34.073
THERE ARE DECISIONS TO BE MADE
IN THERE

24:34.073 --> 24:37.547
THAT WILL AFFECT NOT ONLY
HER ABILITY TO BE A SURGEON--

24:37.547 --> 24:39.979
HER SPEECH, HER ABILITY
TO FUNCTION, HER LIFE.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.011
BUT THOSE DECISIONS
ARE ULTIMATELY MINE.

24:42.011 --> 24:43.983
I WILL NOT MAKE THEM
LIGHTLY.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.786
(sighs) BUT I WILL MAKE THEM
QUICKLY,

24:46.786 --> 24:49.158
AND YOU NEED TO DO EXACTLY
AS I SAY. NO QUESTIONS.

24:49.158 --> 24:50.219
CAN YOU DO THAT?

24:50.219 --> 24:52.121
I THINK SO.

24:52.121 --> 24:53.923
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

24:53.923 --> 24:57.967
YES, SIR.
I-I CAN DO IT, SIR.

24:57.967 --> 25:00.700
(water running)

25:00.700 --> 25:02.732
(faucet turns off)

25:02.732 --> 25:05.504
(water drains)

25:06.936 --> 25:09.008
(rustling)
I'LL TAKE THIS TO THE LABS,

25:09.008 --> 25:10.540
AND DR. AVERY WILL LET YOU KNOW
THE RESULTS.

25:10.540 --> 25:13.142
THANK YOU.

25:13.142 --> 25:16.045
HEY. HEARD YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR THIS GUY.

25:16.045 --> 25:17.747
(gasps, voice breaking) BRIAN!

25:17.747 --> 25:20.720
I WAS SO WORRIED. GET OVER HERE
AND GIVE ME A KISS, YOU JERK.

25:20.720 --> 25:21.791
BABY, I'M ALL MUDDY.

25:21.791 --> 25:23.693
I DON'T CARE.
ARE YOU OKAY?

25:24.794 --> 25:27.997
MMM.
I KNEW THAT WAS
YOUR HANDWRITING.

25:27.997 --> 25:29.999
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:29.999 --> 25:31.000
ON OSCAR.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.764
DIDN'T YOU PULL HIM OUT?
NO.

25:34.764 --> 25:36.566
SOMEONE TRIAGED A BUNCH OF GUYS
AT THE SCENE

25:36.566 --> 25:37.967
AND WROTE VITALS DOWN
WITH A SHARPIE.

25:37.967 --> 25:39.038
YEAH, I WISH THAT WAS ME.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.269
I WAS JUST SITTING
IN AN AIR POCKET,

25:40.269 --> 25:41.771
TWIDDLING MY THUMBS.

25:41.771 --> 25:44.113
UH, I ACTUALLY THINK I'M HAVING
SOME TROUBLE MOVING.

25:44.113 --> 25:46.045
I THINK I BROKE SOME RIBS.
LET'S GET THOSE CHECKED OUT.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.546
YEAH.

25:47.546 --> 25:51.881
UM, I HEARD LENNY WAS
IN SURGERY. HOW'S HE DOING?

25:51.881 --> 25:53.322
I DON'T KNOW.

25:53.322 --> 25:55.955
P.H. IS DOWN TO 7.12.
(monitor beeping erratically)

25:55.955 --> 25:57.987
COME ON, LENNY.

25:57.987 --> 25:59.659
HE'S BEEN DOWN 20 MINUTES.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.134
DID YOU SAY "YES"?

26:05.134 --> 26:06.195
SIR?

26:06.195 --> 26:08.097
TO MATTHEW.

26:08.097 --> 26:10.169
I HELPED
WITH HIS PROPOSAL.

26:10.169 --> 26:15.605
OH, UH, YEAH.
YES. I SAID "YES."

26:15.605 --> 26:16.876
GOOD.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.648
I LIKE HIM.
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

26:18.648 --> 26:20.750
I MEAN, THESE GUYS--

26:20.750 --> 26:25.184
THESE FIRST RESPONDERS--
THEY'RE ALL GOOD GUYS.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.886
HATE TO GIVE UP.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.187
(erratic beeping continues)

26:28.187 --> 26:31.260
(flatlines)

26:31.260 --> 26:32.662
(exhales deeply)

26:34.794 --> 26:36.626
(under breath)
DAMN IT, LENNY.

26:39.328 --> 26:42.702
(telephone ringing,
receiver picks up)

26:42.702 --> 26:48.007
(sighs) TIME OF DEATH--1556.

26:48.007 --> 26:53.082
IT'S DR. KAREV. THE FIREFIGHTERS
ARE ASKING FOR AN UPDATE.

26:53.082 --> 26:54.183
(sighs)

27:10.760 --> 27:12.962
CHAPLAIN'S ON HIS WAY
TO TELL MARLA AND THE GIRLS.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.005
SHE'S GONNA WANNA COME IN

27:16.005 --> 27:17.636
AND SEE HIM.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.838
ABSOLUTELY.

27:18.838 --> 27:22.742
LET'S BRING HER IN.
FULL LIGHTS AND SIRENS.

27:22.742 --> 27:25.074
ON IT.

27:25.074 --> 27:26.976
(Sasha)
LAUENSTEIN'S STILL MISSING.

27:26.976 --> 27:30.680
WE GOTTA BRING HIM BACK.
WE GOTTA DO THAT FOR LENNY.

27:32.922 --> 27:35.084
IF I COULD WALK,
I'D BE OUT ON THAT PILE.

27:35.084 --> 27:37.126
(pager chimes)

27:37.126 --> 27:38.427
(whispers) EXCUSE ME.

27:47.967 --> 27:49.138
KELLY CLAMP.

27:49.138 --> 27:50.339
SUCTION.

27:50.339 --> 27:52.071
GUYS, HE'S ALMOST LOST
HIS ENTIRE BLOOD VOLUME.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.973
IF YOU DON'T GET CONTROL
UP THERE--
IT'S ALREADY DONE.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.674
I CONTROLLED THE BLEEDING
USING A PRINGLE MANEUVER.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.246
WOW. COOL.

27:57.246 --> 27:59.248
DON'T BE SO IMPRESSED.
IT'S FAIRLY STANDARD.

27:59.248 --> 28:01.280
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT YOU DID IT SO WELL.

28:03.182 --> 28:07.016
(huffs)
I WAS WRONG BEFORE, MURPHY,

28:07.016 --> 28:11.320
WHEN I IMPLIED THAT DR. ROBBINS
WASN'T A REAL GENERAL SURGEON.

28:11.320 --> 28:15.094
SHE IS. SHE'S AN EXCELLENT
GENERAL SURGEON.

28:15.094 --> 28:19.128
IT'S OKAY. WE'VE ALL SAID THINGS
THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE.

28:24.974 --> 28:26.876
(sighs)
OH, OWEN.

28:26.876 --> 28:29.979
OWEN, NO.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA "OWEN" THIS.

28:29.979 --> 28:31.280
NO PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
THIS IS PROFESSIONAL.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.982
THIS IS DR. HUNT.
WHAT IS GOING ON?

28:32.982 --> 28:36.045
DR. WEBBER HAS AN ACUTE ABDOMEN.

28:36.045 --> 28:38.788
HE NEEDS SURGERY.
HE BARELY SURVIVED
THE BALLOON PUMP.

28:38.788 --> 28:40.249
HIS LACTATE IS 6...
AND HOLDING.

28:40.249 --> 28:42.892
SO WHAT IF IT'S HOLDING?
SOMETHING IS DEAD INSIDE OF HIM.

28:42.892 --> 28:45.094
IT'S NOT GONNA GET UNDEAD.
IT IS WAY TOO RISKY,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

28:45.094 --> 28:47.056
I WOULD RATHER TAKE THE RISK

28:47.056 --> 28:49.799
THAN JUST WAIT FOR WHAT WE KNOW
IS GONNA KILL HIM.

28:49.799 --> 28:53.102
STOP, STOP. WHAT DOES
HIS HEALTHCARE DIRECTIVE SAY

28:53.102 --> 28:55.865
ABOUT EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES?

28:55.865 --> 28:58.968
(door creaks open)

28:58.968 --> 29:01.110
WHOA. I SMELL DEAD PEOPLE.

29:01.110 --> 29:03.412
OH, AND SPIDERS.
DEAD PEOPLE KILLED BY SPIDERS.

29:03.412 --> 29:05.474
OKAY, LET'S FIND
HIS PERSONNEL FILE.
(electricity surging)

29:05.474 --> 29:07.116
(drawer clatters)

29:07.116 --> 29:10.049
OH! OKAY, I, UH, GOT IT.

29:12.882 --> 29:14.283
"WEBBER."

29:20.189 --> 29:21.490
OH, NO.

29:21.490 --> 29:24.033
WHAT, HE DOESN'T HAVE
A HEALTHCARE DIRECTIVE?

29:24.033 --> 29:29.398
NO. HE HAS ONE.

29:29.398 --> 29:31.040
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:31.040 --> 29:34.173
RICHARD DESIGNATED YOU AS
HIS MEDICAL POWER OF ATTORNEY.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.205
BUT HE CAN'T MAKE ME
NEXT OF KIN

29:36.205 --> 29:38.147
WITHOUT TALKING TO ME FIRST.
HE DID.

29:38.147 --> 29:40.149
AFTER ADELE DIED,
HE REVISED HIS DIRECTIVE.

29:40.149 --> 29:41.410
BUT--
MEREDITH,
I KNOW THIS IS A SHOCK,

29:41.410 --> 29:43.452
BUT WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

29:43.452 --> 29:46.155
RIGHT NOW YOU NEED TO MAKE
A DECISION.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.294
(Cristina) HER HEART
IS TOO WEAK, MEREDITH.
(Bailey)
HIS HEART CAN TAKE IT.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.296
YOU TRUST ME, RIGHT?
YOU NAMED YOUR BABY AFTER ME.
HEY, HEY!

29:57.296 --> 30:00.269
NO PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.
THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY
HE HAD IN HIS BODY

30:00.269 --> 30:01.800
SHOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
INSTANTLY,

30:01.800 --> 30:04.233
BUT IT DIDN'T, WHICH TELLS ME
THAT THE HEART DAMAGE

30:04.233 --> 30:06.435
ISN'T AS BAD AS YOU THINK.
HE CODED FOUR TIMES.

30:06.435 --> 30:08.908
AND WE GOT HIM BACK!
OH, AND NOW YOU JUST SOUND
IDIOTIC.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.880
AH-AH! DR. YANG!

30:10.880 --> 30:12.441
NO, SERIOUSLY. YOU SOUND
LIKE A FAMILY MEMBER

30:12.441 --> 30:13.482
WHO GOOGLED "ELECTROCUTION"

30:13.482 --> 30:14.914
AND IS TRYING
TO REMAIN OPTIMISTIC.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.086
WELL, I AM OPTIMISTIC.

30:17.086 --> 30:19.118
WELL, RICHARD SHOULD HAVE MADE
BAILEY HIS FAMILY MEMBER,

30:19.118 --> 30:21.590
BECAUSE THAT IS HOW
SHE'S ACTING RIGHT NOW.
I WISH HE WOULD'VE.

30:21.590 --> 30:23.953
WELL, HE DIDN'T.
HE PUT MEREDITH DOWN.

30:23.953 --> 30:25.294
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

30:25.294 --> 30:28.397
AND SHE KNOWS AS WELL AS I DO
THAT ELECTRIC SHOCK

30:28.397 --> 30:31.830
CAN CAUSE DEATH OF TISSUES
WHICH COULD START A WHOLE

30:31.830 --> 30:35.534
INFLAMMATORY CASCADE UNLESS
I DEBRIDE WHAT'S BEEN DAMAGED.

30:35.534 --> 30:38.407
WELL, HE'LL HAVE TO HANDLE IT
FOR A DAY TO LET HIS HEART REST.

30:38.407 --> 30:39.838
AND THEN--
HE CAN'T HANDLE IT?

30:39.838 --> 30:41.040
OKAY, NOW YOU SOUND LIKE
AN IDIOT.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.542
LETTING THAT TISSUE DIE
IS LIKE TAKING A GUN

30:43.542 --> 30:46.515
AND KILLING HIM.
WHY WOULDN'T HE TELL ME?

30:46.515 --> 30:49.378
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT HE DIDN'T.

30:49.378 --> 30:52.621
AND IT'S ON YOU,
SO YOU HAVE TO DECIDE, MER.

30:52.621 --> 30:56.625
YES. MEREDITH, PLEASE.

31:00.529 --> 31:02.031
(Derek) DAMN IT.

31:04.063 --> 31:05.995
JUST DAMN IT.

31:05.995 --> 31:09.538
IT'S MASSIVE. BUT... WE CAN
JUST EVACUATE IT, RIGHT?

31:09.538 --> 31:10.900
IT DOESN'T CHANGE
OUR PLAN?

31:10.900 --> 31:12.271
DO WHAT WE CAN
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.649
CAN YOU SEE
HER VITAL SIGNS?

31:20.649 --> 31:23.352
YEAH. (sighs) BAD.

31:23.352 --> 31:24.553
AT LEAST SHANE'S HAPPY.

31:24.553 --> 31:26.385
HEATHER'S OUT
OF THE COMPETITION.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.558
THAT WAS MEAN...
EVEN FOR YOU.

31:29.558 --> 31:31.220
IT WAS A JOKE. I'M TRYING
TO LIGHTEN THE MOOD.

31:31.220 --> 31:33.522
OUR FRIEND IS DYING.
YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE HER.

31:33.522 --> 31:35.894
OH, MY GOD.
JUST IGNORE HER, STEPH.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.066
WELL, SHE USUALLY DOES.

31:37.066 --> 31:38.397
(sighs) WE SHOULD GET BACK.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.100
I LIKE HEATHER.
I KNOW.

31:52.611 --> 31:56.045
YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING
BEFORE YOU GUYS CAME IN HERE?

31:56.045 --> 31:59.688
(sighs) I WAS THINKING
I WISH MY MOTHER WERE HERE

31:59.688 --> 32:01.090
TO SEE MY KIDS.

32:01.090 --> 32:05.454
I WAS WONDERING IF SHE'D
MAKE A GOOD GRANDMOTHER.

32:05.454 --> 32:08.097
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

32:08.097 --> 32:09.598
THAT'S DELUSIONAL THINKING.

32:09.598 --> 32:12.501
BECAUSE MY MOTHER WOULD MAKE
A HORRIBLE GRANDMOTHER,

32:12.501 --> 32:14.633
BECAUSE SHE WAS
A HORRIBLE MOTHER.

32:17.136 --> 32:20.669
SO... I'M DELUSIONAL
AND HORMONAL.

32:20.669 --> 32:23.672
AND I CAN'T TRUST
MY DELUSIONAL THOUGHTS.

32:23.672 --> 32:26.575
I HAVE TO RELY ON THE LABS.

32:26.575 --> 32:29.048
SO WE NEED TO RUN
THE LACTATE AGAIN,

32:29.048 --> 32:32.351
AND IF IT'S ABOVE 6,
WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SURGERY.

32:32.351 --> 32:34.253
AND IF IT'S NOT,
WE'RE NOT.

32:43.592 --> 32:48.137
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

32:48.137 --> 32:49.138
HEY, WHERE'S BRIAN?

32:49.138 --> 32:51.040
WHO'S BRIAN?
(sighs) BED THREE.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.502
BROKEN RIBS.
DEAD FIANCé.

32:53.502 --> 32:54.973
OH! HIM.
MM-HMM.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.645
UM, HE LEFT. ONE OF HIS FRIENDS
IS STILL MISSING.

32:56.645 --> 32:58.707
(sighs) ALL RIGHT.

32:58.707 --> 33:01.250
UH, LISTEN UP, GUYS.

33:01.250 --> 33:03.582
YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING
FOR YOUR FRIENDS THAT ARE HURT?
SURE.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.014
HOW ABOUT DONATING SOME BLOOD?
WE CAN DO THAT.

33:05.014 --> 33:06.655
ALL RIGHT, JUST LINE UP
BEHIND THESE DOCTORS,

33:06.655 --> 33:08.687
AND THEY'RE GONNA HELP YOU OUT.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.189
(lowered voice) THAT WAY,
THEY'RE TIED TO THE TABLE

33:10.189 --> 33:11.660
AND THEY CAN'T TAKE OFF.

33:11.660 --> 33:13.022
OKAY.

33:13.022 --> 33:14.423
(men speak indistinctly)

33:14.423 --> 33:16.225
(siren wailing in distance)

33:16.225 --> 33:17.766
I'LL GIVE SOME BLOOD.

33:17.766 --> 33:21.370
I'LL HELP THE BLOOD BANK STAFF
GET SET UP.

33:21.370 --> 33:22.731
WERE YOU OUT AT THE PILE?

33:22.731 --> 33:24.203
YEAH.

33:24.203 --> 33:26.535
DO YOU KNOW IF 5818 SHORE DRIVE
IS STILL STANDING?

33:26.535 --> 33:29.007
IT'S MY PATIENT'S HOUSE,
AND SHE'S WORRIED.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.179
SHARPIE LADY'S HERE?

33:30.179 --> 33:32.141
SHARPIE LADY?

33:32.141 --> 33:34.043
I WAS EVACUATING HER
WHEN THE MUDSLIDE HAPPENED,

33:34.043 --> 33:35.414
AND SHE RUNS BACK
IN HER HOUSE.

33:35.414 --> 33:36.785
I LOSE IT ON HER,
'CAUSE I'M THINKING

33:36.785 --> 33:38.717
SHE'S LOOKING FOR HER WALLET
OR SOMETHING,

33:38.717 --> 33:40.619
AND I'M LIKE, "LADY,
THAT CRAP CAN BE REPLACED."

33:40.619 --> 33:42.291
AND SHE COMES RUNNING OUT
WITH A SHARPIE

33:42.291 --> 33:43.792
AND IMMEDIATELY STARTS
DIGGING GUYS OUT

33:43.792 --> 33:45.724
AND TAKING THEIR VITALS.

33:45.724 --> 33:48.557
THAT'S WHY HER FINGERS
ARE CRUSHED.

33:48.557 --> 33:50.759
I FEEL KINDA BAD
FOR YELLING AT HER.

33:52.661 --> 33:54.103
(whispers) YEAH.

33:54.103 --> 33:57.606
(sighs) WHAT'S WRONG?

33:57.606 --> 34:01.770
CROWN MOLDING'S A BADASS.

34:01.770 --> 34:03.542
(fussing)

34:03.542 --> 34:05.574
YEAH. OH. OKAY.

34:05.574 --> 34:08.447
HI.

34:11.180 --> 34:12.421
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT

34:12.421 --> 34:14.483
WHEN RICHARD CAUGHT ME
LIVING IN THE LIMB ROOM.

34:14.483 --> 34:17.055
I WAS A RESIDENT.

34:17.055 --> 34:20.289
BEFORE GEORGE. ANYWAY...
I WAS IN THERE ONE NIGHT,

34:20.289 --> 34:24.593
AND HE--RICHARD WALKED IN ON ME
DANCING IN MY UNDERWEAR.
(chuckles)

34:24.593 --> 34:26.735
(laughs)
I WAS SO EMBARRASSED.

34:26.735 --> 34:30.639
I MEAN... HE WAS THE CHIEF.

34:30.639 --> 34:33.642
(monitor beeping steadily)

34:38.307 --> 34:40.149
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:40.149 --> 34:41.850
NO. NO, I'M...

34:44.553 --> 34:47.716
NO, I DON'T DANCE
IN MY UNDERWEAR ANYMORE.

34:49.258 --> 34:51.720
(paper rustles)

34:51.720 --> 34:53.492
LACTATE'S 9.

34:55.824 --> 34:57.696
GO.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.668
(paper rustles)

35:09.478 --> 35:11.180
(Cristina) HEY.

35:11.180 --> 35:13.682
YOU AGREE WITH
MEREDITH'S DECISION?

35:13.682 --> 35:15.484
I THINK IT WAS A COIN TOSS.

35:15.484 --> 35:16.885
YOU GONNA BE IN THERE
WITH BAILEY?

35:16.885 --> 35:18.487
YEAH.

35:18.487 --> 35:20.219
OKAY,
IF HE HAS ABNORMAL BLEEDING,

35:20.219 --> 35:22.491
GIVE HIM FACTOR VII.
HE RESPONDS TO IT WELL.
OKAY.

35:22.491 --> 35:24.423
AND MAKE SURE HIS PULSES
ARE CHECKED HOURLY.

35:24.423 --> 35:27.326
THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
YOU WANNA WRITE THAT DOWN?

35:27.326 --> 35:31.260
NO, I THINK I--
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU KNOW,
LET ME PUT THAT IN YOUR PHONE.

35:31.260 --> 35:32.531
(buttons clicking)
(sighs)

35:32.531 --> 35:36.405
(elevator bell dings)
YOU'RE A CHALLENGING PERSON.

35:36.405 --> 35:37.636
(elevator doors open)
I KNOW.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.639
(indistinct conversations)

35:42.341 --> 35:44.343
(button clicks)

35:47.816 --> 35:50.819
(indistinct conversations)

35:54.823 --> 35:58.427
(radio chatter)

36:00.559 --> 36:01.890
THE SWELLING IS BAD.

36:01.890 --> 36:06.665
SHEPHERD'S HAD TO OPEN UP
A BIGGER CHUNK OF HER SKULL.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.597
THERE'S NO WAY
SHE'S GETTING OUT OF THIS

36:08.597 --> 36:11.400
WITHOUT MAJOR DEFICITS.

36:20.849 --> 36:23.652
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:23.652 --> 36:25.514
HEATHER'S HEMORRHAGING.
YEAH, I HEARD.

36:25.514 --> 36:27.456
SHE COULD DIE.
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
DON'T GO THERE.

36:27.456 --> 36:28.757
SHE'S MY AGE, MY CLASS.

36:28.757 --> 36:30.519
HER LOCKER'S RIGHT NEXT TO MINE.
I USE HER DEODORANT

36:30.519 --> 36:32.391
WITHOUT TELLING HER,
AND SHE COULD DIE.

36:32.391 --> 36:33.822
I KNOW. IT SUCKS.

36:33.822 --> 36:36.295
IT ALL SUCKS.

36:36.295 --> 36:39.328
(exhaling)

36:44.503 --> 36:47.706
(breathing heavily)

36:47.706 --> 36:49.478
MM. WAIT, WAIT. THIS IS BAD.
WE SHOULDN'T.

36:49.478 --> 36:50.509
YEAH.

36:50.509 --> 36:51.880
BUT I WANT TO.
OKAY.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.442
WAIT.

36:53.442 --> 36:56.915
DID YOU HAVE SEX WITH ANY
OF MY FRIENDS IN THIS CLOSET?

36:56.915 --> 36:58.847
UH...

36:58.847 --> 37:01.590
OKAY. NO. THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.
I GOTTA GO.

37:01.590 --> 37:02.651
WH--

37:02.651 --> 37:04.423
OH.

37:04.423 --> 37:05.824
HEY.
HEY.

37:07.356 --> 37:09.928
I WAS JUST GONNA GET
SOME LIDOCAINE,

37:09.928 --> 37:12.301
BUT I'M NOT GONNA SLIP
ON A USED CONDOM, AM I?

37:12.301 --> 37:13.662
SCREW YOU.
YEAH.

37:13.662 --> 37:16.405
DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS ABOUT ME
BEING A BIG SLUT GOT OUT?

37:16.405 --> 37:17.466
YEAH.

37:17.466 --> 37:19.438
(sighs) IT'S MORTIFYING.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.609
BUT, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I THINK THAT--

37:20.609 --> 37:22.010
I THINK THAT
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

37:22.010 --> 37:23.742
YOU KNOW, I-I THINK--I THINK
IT'S GONNA MAKE US STRONGER.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.344
(opens drawer)
YOU KNOW, LIKE A BONE.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.676
(closes drawer)
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU--
YOU HAVE TO--

37:27.676 --> 37:29.418
YOU HAVE TO BREAK IT IN ORDER
FOR IT TO HEAL CORRECTLY.

37:29.418 --> 37:32.651
