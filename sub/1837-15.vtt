You make a face

Will do.

04:13.767 --> 04:16.200
Okay, two things, home brah:

One, don't ever use
that pickup line

04:18.200 --> 04:20.233
ever again
in your natural-born life.

04:20.233 --> 04:21.700
And two:

04:21.700 --> 04:24.133
I cannot believe
you can get a vision
whenever you want.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.967
I made the face,
had a vision, got a date.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.133
It's all good.

04:28.133 --> 04:30.834
Wait, Eddie, you do
realize what this means.

04:30.834 --> 04:31.834
Yes.

04:31.834 --> 04:32.834
No.

04:32.834 --> 04:34.767
It means you can't
tell anybody.

04:34.767 --> 04:36.900
Right. Why not?

04:36.900 --> 04:38.300
Because if you
tell people

04:38.300 --> 04:40.767
you're psychic, Eddie,
they'll think you're a freak.

04:40.767 --> 04:42.000

09:13.300 --> 09:16.567
Not like I would know
or anything.

09:17.967 --> 09:20.467
Eddie, you and Katina,

09:20.467 --> 09:22.133
yeah, man,
it's not looking so good.

09:22.133 --> 09:24.133
According to my vision,
I'm getting a kiss.

09:24.133 --> 09:25.834
According to mine,

09:25.834 --> 09:27.734
you're getting
a kiss-off.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.100
You're just jealous.

09:29.100 --> 09:29.967
Of what?

09:29.967 --> 09:31.100
Of how popular I am, Rae.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.967
Popular?! Eddie!

09:32.967 --> 09:34.700
You actually think
those people are
your friends?

09:34.700 --> 09:37.233
They're just using you
to get your predictions.

09:37.233 --> 09:38.300
Oh, yeah?

09:38.300 --> 09:40.734
Well, here's another prediction.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.200
I'm outta here!

09:44.500 --> 09:46.000
Oh, come on.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.233
I mean, even I could have
predicted that.

09:59.834 --> 10:02.367
So, you guys still not talking
to Eddie?

10:02.367 --> 10:03.767
No.

10:03.767 --> 10:06.100
Ever since he became psychic,
he thinks he's all that.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.600
Oh, come on. Eddie?

10:07.600 --> 10:10.400
He's still the same old
humble guy.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.567
(<i>all chanting </i>):
Eddie! Eddie!

10:12.567 --> 10:13.500
Eddie!

10:13.500 --> 10:14.867
I'm king of the world!

10:14.867 --> 10:16.000
Unleash me!

10:18.667 --> 10:23.200
See? Same old humble
king of the world.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.200
Eddie, you were right.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.500
I got a B on my bio test.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.400
GIRL:
Wow! Good!

10:27.400 --> 10:29.100
Your visions are amazing.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.367
Everybody loves you.

10:30.367 --> 10:31.767
(<i>approving murmurs </i>)

10:31.767 --> 10:33.100
Y'all do?

10:33.100 --> 10:34.600
Do y'all love me?
You know what, Rae?

10:34.600 --> 10:36.000
I was thinking.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.200
You know how you never wanted

10:37.200 --> 10:38.467
anyone knowing you were psychic

10:38.467 --> 10:39.934
'cause you thought
they'd all think

10:39.934 --> 10:41.233
you were like a freak
or something?
Yeah.

10:41.233 --> 10:42.834
Well, I don't know.
Maybe you should tell 'em.

10:42.834 --> 10:44.500
Look at Eddie.
Apparently, people like freaks.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.000
EDDIE:
You know what I'm saying?
It was all on me.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.100
Who thinks Eddie
should have

10:48.100 --> 10:49.100
his own TV show?

10:49.100 --> 10:50.000
I do.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.133
(<i>all agreeing </i>)

10:51.133 --> 10:52.367
EDDIE:
Would y'all watch that?

10:52.367 --> 10:53.834
Okay, now that is just
ridiculous.

10:53.834 --> 10:56.200
I mean, who would watch a show
about a teen psychic?

10:56.200 --> 10:56.967
I know.

11:01.100 --> 11:02.834
Hey, Eddie--
Sonny Curtis.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.100
Remember me?

11:04.100 --> 11:06.100
I went to your
school last year.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.133
Sonny?! Hey, what's poppin'
with you, man?

11:08.133 --> 11:10.734
Nothing, really. I hear
you're pretty good at
making predictions.

11:10.734 --> 11:11.834
Yeah, it's a gift.

11:11.834 --> 11:13.200
Word is, you're
on a hot streak.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.400
Haven't been wrong yet.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.467
Well, let's try a
little experiment, huh?

11:16.467 --> 11:17.967
Take a look at these names.

11:17.967 --> 11:19.233
Anything pop out at you?

11:19.233 --> 11:21.467
Well, let me see
what I can whip up, you know?

11:21.467 --> 11:22.767
(<i>chuckles </i>)

11:24.767 --> 11:26.667
(<i>whooshing </i>)

11:31.233 --> 11:33.033
(<i>sighs </i>)

11:33.033 --> 11:35.467
Eh, well, I saw
the name "Live Wire."

11:35.467 --> 11:36.700
That mean anything?

11:36.700 --> 11:39.700
Well, we'll find out.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.500
Yo, Sonny, man.
This is 20 bones.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.867
Man, if you're as good
as you say you are,

11:45.867 --> 11:48.133
there's a lot more
where that came from.

11:48.133 --> 11:50.133
Well, all right, Sonny!

11:50.133 --> 11:51.734
(<i>laughs </i>)

11:55.100 --> 11:56.400
He said what?!

11:56.400 --> 11:57.500
Don't worry.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.000
My husband and I
are going to have

11:59.000 --> 12:00.367
a serious talk with Corey

12:00.367 --> 12:02.500
about this.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.767
Hold up there,
Cool Breeze.

12:05.767 --> 12:10.000
Corey... did you call your
teacher a "jive turkey sucker"?

12:10.000 --> 12:13.100
<i>Somebody </i>had to stand up
to the man.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.133
Mrs. Applebaum is not The Man.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.800
Corey, how many times
did you watch

12:18.800 --> 12:21.200
that<i>Disco Divas </i>tape
your father brought home?

12:21.200 --> 12:23.700
Just a dozen... cousin!

12:23.700 --> 12:25.934
Just because people
act a certain way
in the movies,

12:25.934 --> 12:27.734
doesn't mean they act that way

12:27.734 --> 12:29.600
in real life.
Honey, when you go

12:29.600 --> 12:30.400
to school tomorrow,

12:30.400 --> 12:31.734
you have to apologize

12:31.734 --> 12:32.867
to Mrs. Applebaum.

12:32.867 --> 12:34.200
And the lunch lady, too?!

12:34.200 --> 12:35.567
What did you say to<i>her?</i>

12:35.567 --> 12:37.867
I told her without her hair net,

12:37.867 --> 12:40.200
she looked like one foxy mama!

12:43.600 --> 12:45.033
Eddie!

12:45.033 --> 12:46.100
Hey.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.700
Hey.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.000
Just like in my vision.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.033
Aw, you're so sweet.

12:52.033 --> 12:53.467
Now, make that
cute little face,

12:53.467 --> 12:54.800
and tell me if
I'm going to be

12:54.800 --> 12:56.033
captain of the
cheerleaders.

12:56.033 --> 12:57.233
You got it, baby.

12:57.233 --> 12:58.934
Let me see what I can do
on the face here.

12:58.934 --> 13:00.700
(<i>sniffles </i>)

13:00.700 --> 13:02.667
(<i>whooshing, crackling </i>)

13:02.667 --> 13:04.834
(<i>giggling </i>):
Okay, what's
wrong, Eddie?

13:04.834 --> 13:06.867
Uh... uh...
nothing, nothing.

13:06.867 --> 13:08.734
Uh...

13:08.734 --> 13:11.300
(<i>sighing </i>):
Let me see...

13:13.467 --> 13:14.667
(<i>groaning </i>)

13:14.667 --> 13:16.734
Is there a problem?

13:16.734 --> 13:18.100
(<i>grunts </i>)

13:18.100 --> 13:20.300
No, I just, uh...
got a lot on my mind.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.200
This never happened
to me before.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.467
Okay, so you're saying you
can't come up with anything?

13:25.467 --> 13:27.600
Woman, I'm trying,
if you would stop

13:27.600 --> 13:29.233
putting so much pressure on me.

13:29.233 --> 13:32.667
Well, if you can't<i>tell </i>me
the future, we<i>have </i>no future.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.100
(<i>snaps fingers </i>)

13:37.500 --> 13:39.033
Whatever.

13:41.767 --> 13:44.200
(<i>pounding house music plays </i>)

13:44.200 --> 13:45.834
(<i>music stops </i>)

13:47.233 --> 13:48.467
What...?

13:48.467 --> 13:50.300
(<i>house music plays </i>)

13:50.300 --> 13:51.934
Well, all right!

13:56.000 --> 13:57.233
(<i>music stops </i>)

13:57.233 --> 13:59.000
Like the way
I hooked you up?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.033
Man, Sonny,
you did this, man?!

14:02.000 --> 14:05.400
(<i>house music plays </i>)

14:05.400 --> 14:06.600
(<i>music stops </i>)

14:06.600 --> 14:07.900
That's funky, man!

14:08.600 --> 14:09.500
Man, but why?

14:09.500 --> 14:11.000
That horse you picked won.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.100
What horse?

14:13.100 --> 14:14.300
Live Wire.

14:14.300 --> 14:16.567
He won the race,
and I won a bundle.

14:16.567 --> 14:17.767
Wait a minute.

14:17.767 --> 14:19.867
I picked a horse
for you to bet on?

14:19.867 --> 14:21.500
Man, that's gambling, dawg.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.667
Not when it's a sure thing.

14:23.667 --> 14:25.000
Yeah, yeah. I guess so.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.834
Now I need you to do
that thing you do and, uh,

14:26.834 --> 14:30.500
pick me out another winner.
Man, I don't know
about that...

14:30.500 --> 14:31.967
Man, look. Just make
that stupid face,

14:31.967 --> 14:33.100
and tell me who's going to win.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.000
Right.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.300
(<i>rumbling, crackling </i>)

14:39.300 --> 14:40.367
(<i>muttering </i>)

14:40.367 --> 14:41.400
(<i>grunts </i>)

14:41.400 --> 14:42.667
Sonny, I'm
getting something.

14:42.667 --> 14:44.300
Yeah.

14:45.834 --> 14:47.500
Mur the Blur.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.233
Mur the Blur?

14:48.233 --> 14:49.467
Mur the Blur.

14:49.467 --> 14:51.600
Interesting.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.934
He's never won
a race before.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.300
He's going to pay off
big-time.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.600
I'm betting it<i>all </i>on this one.

14:58.734 --> 15:00.467
(<i>quietly </i>):
Yeah.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.700
I guess I am, too.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.000
I don't know, Rae.
I still wish Eddie

15:06.000 --> 15:07.600
was doing the song
with us tonight.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.467
(<i>clearing throat </i>):
Chelsea, I thought we said

15:09.467 --> 15:10.934
we were not going to talk
about him.

15:10.934 --> 15:12.500
You're right.
I forgot.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.600
Not a word.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.734
Right.

15:14.734 --> 15:16.467
(<i>voice breaking </i>):
'Cause you know,

15:16.467 --> 15:18.467
he decided to ditch<i>us.</i>

15:18.467 --> 15:20.567
I mean, he's
all popular now.

15:20.567 --> 15:24.667
And all the girls are like,
"Ooh, Eddie! You so cute!

15:24.667 --> 15:26.500
"You so psychic, Eddie!

15:26.500 --> 15:28.800
Ooh, Eddie, you got the
prettiest little eyes..."

15:28.800 --> 15:32.300
Rae, Rae, Rae, Rae, Rae, Rae,
Rae, Rae! Calm down!

15:32.300 --> 15:34.133
Come on, now!

15:34.133 --> 15:35.867
Don't wig out.

15:35.867 --> 15:39.133
(<i>cackles </i>)

15:39.133 --> 15:40.233
Get it?

15:40.233 --> 15:41.734
Like, wig-- like, wig out!

15:41.734 --> 15:42.867
(<i>cackles </i>)

15:42.867 --> 15:45.200
(<i>whooshing </i>)

15:45.200 --> 15:47.133
Know what...?

15:47.133 --> 15:49.133
Look, just be easy, okay?

15:49.133 --> 15:50.967
Oh, my goodness, Chelsea!

15:50.967 --> 15:54.100
I just had a vision
that Eddie's going
to be in trouble.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.400
He's at the Chill Grill.
We gotta go and help him!

15:56.400 --> 15:58.100
Hey, what's up, Mr. B.?

15:58.100 --> 16:01.033
Hey, hey, hey!

16:01.033 --> 16:02.700
(<i>chuckles </i>)

16:02.700 --> 16:05.367
Hey, uh, mind if I hang out?
You know, watch a little TV?

16:05.367 --> 16:07.100
News, sports,
horse race results.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.100
Oh, yeah, sure!
Make yourself at home.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.967
You know, '70s Night's
about to start in about an hour.

16:11.967 --> 16:14.467
I need to get home and
get my boogie clothes on.

16:14.467 --> 16:15.800
Wait, wait, Mr. B.
You're not going

16:15.800 --> 16:17.467
to leave me here
all alone, are you?

16:17.467 --> 16:18.700
Oh, yeah, sure.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.600
You can stay here.
Keep an eye on the place.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.033
That way,
I don't have to lock up.

16:22.033 --> 16:23.200
(<i>sighs </i>)

16:23.200 --> 16:24.467
Dang!

16:24.467 --> 16:27.300
Okay... TV... TV...

16:28.600 --> 16:30.400
NEWSCASTER:
Here's the latest

16:30.400 --> 16:32.000
from Comet Watch.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.400
Pyramids Comet
has left the building.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.567
Good-bye for another
hundred years.

16:36.567 --> 16:39.100
And good-bye
to all those wacky stories

16:39.100 --> 16:42.400
of people claiming the comet
gave them weird powers.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.200
Boy, there's a lot
of nuts out there.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.934
NEWSCASTER:
In a sports update,

16:45.934 --> 16:48.767
a new record was just set,

16:48.767 --> 16:52.967
as Mur the Blur came in
dead last for the 27th time.

16:52.967 --> 16:54.400
(<i>sighs </i>)

16:54.400 --> 16:56.300
Man...

16:57.200 --> 16:58.700
(<i>sighs </i>)

16:58.700 --> 17:01.100
Some race, huh?

17:02.834 --> 17:04.200
Sonny!

17:04.200 --> 17:06.300
I was counting on you, man.
What happened?

17:06.300 --> 17:08.567
Well, you know the comet
that came through the other day?

17:08.567 --> 17:10.100
Funny thing...

17:10.100 --> 17:12.800
There's nothing funny
about me losing my money.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.834
See, 'cause when I lose,
<i>you </i>pay.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.100
Yeah, guy, but if we were
in an opposite universe,

17:17.100 --> 17:18.300
then I would lose,

17:18.300 --> 17:20.000
and<i>you </i>would pay!

17:20.000 --> 17:21.934
Okay, that's still not good.

17:21.934 --> 17:23.500
You know what?

17:23.500 --> 17:24.967
Look, just be easy, okay?

17:24.967 --> 17:26.700
Freeze, suckas!
Freeze, suckas!

17:29.200 --> 17:31.133
What's goin' on?
Who-who are you two?

17:32.734 --> 17:33.834
I'm Coffee.

17:33.834 --> 17:37.100
Yeah, and I'm Cream!

17:38.033 --> 17:40.400
And you are stone-cold

17:40.400 --> 17:42.300
busted.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.600
You're cops?

17:43.600 --> 17:44.667
Yeah! I know these two.

17:44.667 --> 17:47.233
Man, you're in
