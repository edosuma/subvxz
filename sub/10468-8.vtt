LOOK, JULIA,

10:07.389 --> 10:10.435
UM...I KNOW
THAT IT'S HARD,

10:10.435 --> 10:12.960
BUT THIS IS HOW
A BOOK GETS GOOD.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.440
IT'S GETTING
THE TOUGHEST
REACTIONS YOU CAN

10:15.440 --> 10:17.486
AND THEN RESPONDING
TO THOSE.

10:17.486 --> 10:19.488
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE
ASKED TO READ THESE.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.533
NO, NO. YOU WERE
SMART TO ASK.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.492
IT'S BETTER THAT YOU
LOOK AT THESE
COMMENTS YOURSELF

10:23.492 --> 10:25.581
RATHER THAN HAVING THEM
FILTER THROUGH ME.

10:25.581 --> 10:28.410
I SPENT SO MUCH TIME
ON THIS.

10:30.064 --> 10:31.631
WELL...

10:36.113 --> 10:39.116
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE
GONNA TAKE YOUR
PUBLISHER'S HAT OFF

10:39.116 --> 10:42.119
TO SLIP ME SOME MEMOS,
CAN'T YOU KEEP IT OFF
LONG ENOUGH

10:42.119 --> 10:44.165
TO SHOW THE TINIEST
BIT OF SYMPATHY?

10:44.165 --> 10:46.820
I MEAN, CAN'T YOU SAY,
HEY, HONEY, THIS SUCKS,

10:46.820 --> 10:49.431
OR YOU WHAT WHAT?
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK.

10:49.431 --> 10:50.650
I BELIEVE IN YOU?

10:50.650 --> 10:53.261
YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE.
OBVIOUSLY.

10:53.261 --> 10:57.613
WELL, IT WOULD BE NICE
TO HEAR IT SAID FROM
THE PERSON THAT I'M DATING.

10:57.613 --> 11:00.268
WHAT--DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY WHAT
YOU JUST SAID?

11:01.791 --> 11:04.925
FINE.
I BELIEVE IN YOU,
JULIA.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.067
[DOOR OPENS]

11:20.723 --> 11:22.725
IS HE ASLEEP?

11:22.725 --> 11:24.292
YEAH.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.425
LATE PAPER?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.429
MIDTERM TOMORROW?

11:31.429 --> 11:32.909
HMM?

11:32.909 --> 11:34.694
NO. UM...

11:34.694 --> 11:36.652
NOTES CAME IN
ON MY FIRST DRAFT

11:36.652 --> 11:37.914
FROM THE REST OF
HIS STAFF.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.611
AND...THEY'RE HARSH.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.702
LEMME SEE.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.969
[LAUGHS]

11:48.969 --> 11:50.144
IDIOT.

11:50.144 --> 11:52.450
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

11:52.450 --> 11:54.801
YOU HAVEN'T READ
MY BOOK. MAYBE
THE GUY'S RIGHT.

11:54.801 --> 11:57.455
OH, I'M NOT
SAYING HE'S NOT.
IT'S JUST...

11:57.455 --> 11:59.066
HE SPELLED
INEFFECTUAL WRONG.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.197
NO, HE DIDN'T.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.546
WITH A "A".HE DID?

12:02.417 --> 12:04.549
LET ME SEE THAT.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.160
HUH. "INAFFECTUAL".
YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.465
HE DID!

12:07.465 --> 12:08.945
AND THIS ONE. AHEM...

12:08.945 --> 12:10.425
BY P.U...

12:10.425 --> 12:13.254
[BOTH LAUGH]

12:13.254 --> 12:15.343
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS

12:15.343 --> 12:17.258
WITH INITIALS LIKE THAT?

12:17.258 --> 12:19.651
I'D PROBABLY HATE
EVERYTHING, TOO.

12:19.651 --> 12:22.785
STOP IT! HOW AM
I SUPPOSED TO
STAY DEPRESSED

12:22.785 --> 12:24.439
WHEN YOU WON'T
SHUT UP?

12:24.439 --> 12:25.919
LOOK...

12:25.919 --> 12:27.921
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS...

12:27.921 --> 12:29.400
THEY'RE JUST JEALOUS.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.620
OH, COME ON.

12:31.620 --> 12:34.144
WHAT, ARE YOU
KIDDING?

12:34.144 --> 12:36.103
TO BE AS YOUNG
AS YOU ARE...

12:36.103 --> 12:39.149
AND AS SMART AS YOU ARE...

12:39.149 --> 12:40.890
AND AS--

12:42.500 --> 12:45.547
AS S-SMART AS YOU ARE.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.992
WELL, ANYWAYS, THANKS.
I--I SHOULD, UM...

12:55.992 --> 12:59.082
I SHOULD STOP OBSESSING
AND GO TO BED.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.605
I'LL SEE YOU IN
THE MORNING.

13:00.605 --> 13:01.737
SURE.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.609
NIGHT.

13:07.482 --> 13:08.613
NIGHT.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.661
FIRST KISS.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.663
OH. LET ME SEE.
UH...

13:14.663 --> 13:17.013
THAT WOULD BE
THERESA OSMOND.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.537
THERESA? [LAUGHS]
OK, I'M INTRIGUED.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.539
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WAS PRACTICING

13:21.539 --> 13:23.541
FOR MY SECOND KISS
WITH DOUG HARRISON.
VERY DREAMY.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.500
I SEEM TO REMEMBER
WEARING HIS
SPIDER RING

13:25.500 --> 13:27.545
FOR THE FIRST HALF
OF MY SEVENTH YEAR,
ACTUALLY.

13:27.545 --> 13:30.070
ONLY HALF?
YOU KIDS COULDN'T
MAKE IT WORK?

13:30.070 --> 13:33.377
WELL, YOU KNOW.
HE WAS TERRIBLY
CLINGY.

13:33.377 --> 13:36.554
A BIT LIKE YOU
IN THE STREET
YESTERDAY, ACTUALLY.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.556
BUT YOU'RE HERE, THOUGH,
RIGHT?

13:38.556 --> 13:40.428
RIGHT?

13:40.428 --> 13:42.299
2, PLEASE.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.258
OK. MY TURN.

13:44.258 --> 13:47.043
FIRST TIME A GIRL
WON YOU A STUFFED
ANIMAL.

13:47.043 --> 13:49.393
UH, LET'S SEE...

13:49.393 --> 13:50.960
THAT'D BE TODAY.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.527
GOOD.
AND I HAVE TO SAY

13:52.527 --> 13:55.486
THAT MY CHARM BRACELET
IS NO LESS MEANINGFUL TO ME

13:55.486 --> 13:58.054
FOR THE FACT THAT
YOU HAD TO BRIBE
THE MAN FOR IT.

13:58.054 --> 14:00.187
YEAH, WELL, IT'S
NO SPIDER RING...

14:00.187 --> 14:01.449
NO.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.713
I LIKE YOU.

14:04.713 --> 14:07.585
I HAD A FEELING.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.674
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

14:09.674 --> 14:13.156
BUT MY...
SUAVE, CHARMING LEVELS
ARE WAY UP.

14:13.156 --> 14:15.158
YEAH, BUT YOU GET
SERIOUS POINTS OFF

14:15.158 --> 14:17.682
FOR HAVING TO
POINT THAT OUT.

14:17.682 --> 14:19.249
[LAUGHING]

14:20.816 --> 14:22.862
I LIKE YOU, TOO.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.213
ONLY...

14:26.213 --> 14:29.477
NOT AS MUCH
AS YOU LIKE ME...

14:29.477 --> 14:33.046
WHICH I SENSE
IS WHAT'S GONNA
KEEP YOU INTERESTED.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.787
SO YOU KNOW MY TYPE,
DO YOU?

14:35.787 --> 14:37.354
PREMED SINCE
FRESHMAN YEAR.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.748
REFUSED TO TAKE
ANY MONEY OFF
MY PARENTS,

14:39.748 --> 14:41.706
HENCE 2 PART-TIME
JOBS.

14:41.706 --> 14:44.709
I'D RATHER DRIVE
THAN BE A PASSENGER.

14:44.709 --> 14:48.539
I THINK THAT ORDERING
IN A RESTAURANT SHOULD
BE A COMPETITIVE SPORT.

14:48.539 --> 14:51.629
TELL ME THAT
I CAN'T DO SOMETHING
OR BE SOMETHING

14:51.629 --> 14:53.631
OR HAVE SOMETHING
AND...I'M THERE.

14:53.631 --> 14:56.504
SEE...I DON'T JUST
KNOW YOUR TYPE,
BAILEY.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.941
I AM YOUR TYPE.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.902
I COULD HAVE
TOLD YOU THAT.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.255
HEY.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.562
YOU'RE HERE A LOT
LATELY.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.869
YEAH, WELL,
BUSINESS IS
GOOD.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.917
DAPHNE'S HERE
A LOT, TOO.

15:19.309 --> 15:22.051
GUESS I SHOULD HAVE
PUT THAT TOGETHER.

15:22.051 --> 15:24.924
JULIE, LOOK, UM...

15:24.924 --> 15:26.273
I THINK IT'S COOL.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.840
I MEAN, HONESTLY,
MY IMMEDIATE REACTION

15:28.840 --> 15:30.973
IS TO BE A LITTLE
JEALOUS,

15:30.973 --> 15:32.844
THE THOUGHT OF YOU
WITH ANYONE.

15:32.844 --> 15:36.109
YEAH, WELL, UH...
THERE'S NOTHING REALLY
TO BE JEALOUS ABOUT.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.675
I MEAN, UH...

15:37.675 --> 15:41.636
DAPHNE AND ME, WE'RE...
NOT TOGETHER LIKE THAT.

15:41.636 --> 15:45.161
I MEAN, SHE'S NICE
AND SHE'S FUN
AND STUFF,

15:45.161 --> 15:48.208
BUT, YOU KNOW, CAN I
SEE MYSELF WITH HER?

15:49.557 --> 15:51.428
YEAH.

15:51.428 --> 15:54.301
WELL, BEFORE
YOU AND I GOT TOGETHER,
COULD YOU PICTURE US?

15:54.301 --> 15:56.303
OH, WELL, THAT'S...

15:56.303 --> 15:58.000
THAT'S JUST IT.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.176
YOU AND I WERE
A TERRIBLE MATCH.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.351
HA HA!

16:01.351 --> 16:04.050
BUT THAT KINDA
MADE IT FOR ME.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.704
YOU WERE ALWAYS
THIS BIG SURPRISE.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.969
BUT, UM, DAPHNE...

16:09.969 --> 16:12.319
SHE'S, UH...

16:12.319 --> 16:15.191
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE SO MUCH LIKE ME.

16:18.194 --> 16:22.155
HAVE YOU TOLD HER
HOW YOU FEEL?

16:23.547 --> 16:25.549
GRIFFIN...

16:25.549 --> 16:27.943
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
LET HER KNOW.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.469
[SIGHS]

16:32.469 --> 16:35.472
ROLLED UP PAPERS
AND...JUNK.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.257
YOU WANT 'EM?

16:37.257 --> 16:40.173
YEAH. THOSE ARE
ALL MY DESIGNS FROM
THE FURNITURE BUSINESS.

16:40.173 --> 16:43.437
MMM. THIS ONE'S JUST
PENCILS AND RULERS.

16:43.437 --> 16:46.657
I NEED THAT.
THAT'S MY DRAFTING
STUFF.

16:46.657 --> 16:50.531
HEY, YOU WANT ALL THESE
TEDDY BEARS, CHARLIE?

16:50.531 --> 16:52.359
SURE.

16:58.930 --> 17:01.063
THAT A DOLL HOUSE?

17:01.063 --> 17:03.979
NO. NO, IT'S A, UH...
IT'S A MODEL OF
A REAL HOUSE

17:03.979 --> 17:05.763
THAT SOMEBODY
COULD BUILD.

17:05.763 --> 17:06.938
WHERE'D YOU GET IT?

17:06.938 --> 17:08.940
I MADE IT.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.377
YOU MADE IT?

17:10.377 --> 17:11.421
YEAH, YEAH.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.380
FOR SCHOOL.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.469
YOU MADE THAT
YOURSELF?

17:15.469 --> 17:18.080
LONG TIME AGO, I DID.

17:19.821 --> 17:22.911
LISTEN, UM...
I'M QUITTING
THE HOMECOMING COMMITTEE.

17:22.911 --> 17:24.913
QUITTING? BUT WHY?

17:24.913 --> 17:27.176
I MEAN...CLAUD,
WE NEED YOU.

17:28.438 --> 17:31.354
DO YOU NEED DEREK?

17:31.354 --> 17:34.357
ALEXA, I JUST DON'T
GET HOW YOU CAN
SIT THERE

17:34.357 --> 17:37.143
AND JOKE AROUND WITH HIM
AFTER WHAT HE DID.

17:37.143 --> 17:39.449
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE WAS A TOTAL JERK.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.192
A JERK.

17:43.192 --> 17:46.021
HE WAS WORSE
THAN A JERK!

17:46.021 --> 17:47.936
SO...THAT'S YOUR
POSITION NOW?

17:47.936 --> 17:49.764
WHAT?

17:49.764 --> 17:53.289
I'M SORRY, BUT...

17:53.289 --> 17:57.163
CLAUDIA, YOU WERE
THE ONE WHO DECIDED
NOT TO REPORT HIM.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.816
YOU LET IT SLIDE.

17:58.816 --> 18:01.210
AND...IF SUDDENLY
YOU REGRET THAT,
WELL...

18:01.210 --> 18:04.779
IT'S NOT FAIR TO
ASK US TO PUNISH HIM
FOR YOU, IS IT?

18:09.131 --> 18:11.568
HEY, EVAN,
I BROUGHT FOOD.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.098
HEY.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.535
IS HE BACK YET?

18:21.535 --> 18:23.232
UH...I DON'T KNOW.

18:23.232 --> 18:26.148
I JUST STOPPED BY
TO, UH...PACK UP.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.671
PACK UP?
A-ARE YOU...

18:27.671 --> 18:29.020
YEAH. I'M GOIN'
BACK.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.848
TO SANTA CRUZ.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.198
OH. WELL, UH, WHY...

18:32.198 --> 18:34.504
WHY SO SUDDENLY?

18:36.027 --> 18:37.551
LOOK, UH...

18:37.551 --> 18:40.031
TURNS OUT I--I SORTA, UH...

18:40.031 --> 18:43.034
TALKED MYSELF
INTO BELIEVING
THAT KISS WAS

18:43.034 --> 18:47.300
A WEIRD COMBINATION
OF YOU HELPING ME
WITH MY DAD

18:47.300 --> 18:50.216
AND HOW YOU LOOKED,
COUPLED WITH MY
GIRLFRIENDLESSNESS--

18:50.216 --> 18:52.174
BRIAN, YOU DON'T--

18:52.174 --> 18:55.046
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DWELL ON THIS.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.657
REALLY, I MEAN,
WE'RE OK.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.876
YOU AND ME,
WE'RE FRIENDS.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.704
ACTUALLY,
YOU'RE OK WITH THIS,

19:00.704 --> 19:03.707
BUT ME...I SWEAR,
I'M FIGHTING
AGAINST IT,

19:03.707 --> 19:06.319
BUT DEEP DOWN...

19:06.319 --> 19:10.627
I'M A GUY
WHO'S WAITING FOR
AN OPPORTUNITY HERE.

19:10.627 --> 19:12.586
BRIAN--
IT'S NOT RIGHT,

19:12.586 --> 19:15.763
BECAUSE...
WELL, OBVIOUSLY
YOU'RE WITH MY DAD.

19:15.763 --> 19:19.070
SO BEFORE I, LIKE,
KISS YOU AGAIN

19:19.070 --> 19:22.030
OR START BEHAVING
LIKE AN EVEN BIGGER
IDIOT,

19:22.030 --> 19:24.511
I'M JUST GONNA GO, OK?

19:33.433 --> 19:34.782
HEY.

19:36.305 --> 19:38.394
HOW MUCH OF THAT
DID YOU--

19:38.394 --> 19:39.787
ENOUGH.

19:48.926 --> 19:52.887
SOONER OR LATER
BAILEY,
THIS DATE IS...

19:52.887 --> 19:54.889
GONNA HAVE TO END.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.369
I VOTE FOR LATER.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.892
[LAUGHS]

19:57.892 --> 19:59.937
SO, CAPPUCCINO,
ESPRESSO, APERITIF?

19:59.937 --> 20:01.722
WHATEVER YOU
RECOMMEND.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.335
I RECOMMEND...
YOU GO OUT WITH ME AGAIN.

20:06.335 --> 20:10.731
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
A LOT OF ADVANTAGES
TO HAVING

20:10.731 --> 20:12.733
ONE REALLY NICE DATE

20:12.733 --> 20:14.735
AND THEN NEVER SEEING
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

20:14.735 --> 20:15.910
SUCH AS...

20:15.910 --> 20:18.217
WELL, YOU'RE LEFT
WITH THIS...

20:18.217 --> 20:21.045
REALLY PERFECT
INTACT MEMORY,

20:21.045 --> 20:25.093
AND YOU...NEVER
GET AROUND TO
DISAPPOINTING
EACH OTHER.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.877
AND THAT'S INEVITABLE?

20:26.877 --> 20:29.750
SURE. I MEAN,
EVERYONE HAS SKELETONS
IN THEIR CLOSET

20:29.750 --> 20:31.708
THAT HAVE TO COME OUT
SOONER OR LATER.

20:31.708 --> 20:35.234
WELL, MY--MINE
ARE YOUR...NORMAL

20:35.234 --> 20:37.453
STANDARD-ISSUE
SKELETONS.

20:37.453 --> 20:38.802
MM.

20:38.802 --> 20:41.936
PROBLEMS
THAT I'VE OVERCOME...

20:41.936 --> 20:43.938
A LONG-TERM
RELATIONSHIP

20:43.938 --> 20:45.983
THAT ENDED
IN THE FALL.

20:45.983 --> 20:48.116
AND SCARS FROM THAT?

20:48.116 --> 20:49.770
SOME.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.687
EXCUSE ME.
I'M SORRY, MISS.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.602
HEY, JOE, DO ME
A FAVOR, WILL YOU?

20:55.602 --> 20:57.908
SEND OVER LIKE
AN ASSORTMENT
OF DESSERTS.

20:57.908 --> 21:00.215
ABSOLUTELY.
BUT THERE'S A GENTLEMAN
HERE TO SEE YOU. SO...

21:00.215 --> 21:01.651
THIS IS HIM?
YOU'RE SALINGER?

21:01.651 --> 21:03.262
YES.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:03.262 --> 21:05.176
SHE TOLD ME. TRACY.

21:05.176 --> 21:06.482
ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN DOING.

21:06.482 --> 21:07.744
OK, HOLD ON A MINUTE--

21:07.744 --> 21:09.659
NOT THAT I COULDN'T
HAVE FIGURED IT OUT.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.835
SHE'S GOT MATCHBOOKS
FROM THIS PLACE LYING
ON THE DAMN NIGHT TABLE.

21:11.835 --> 21:13.446
ALL RIGHT. THIS
IS NOT THE PLACE.

21:13.446 --> 21:15.448
I HAD TO GET A LOOK AT YOU.
I WANTED TO SEE

21:15.448 --> 21:17.754
WHAT KIND OF GUY WOULD
ACTUALLY CHASE A WOMAN WHO--

21:17.754 --> 21:19.930
YOU ARE SCUM, PAL.
YOU KNOW THAT?

21:19.930 --> 21:21.671
IS THIS ONE
MARRIED, TOO?

21:21.671 --> 21:23.325
LET'S TAKE IT OUTSIDE,
SHALL WE? COME ON.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.370
HEY! COME ON!

21:24.370 --> 21:25.675
CUT IT OUT!

21:25.675 --> 21:27.242
LET'S GO! LET'S GO!

21:38.297 --> 21:40.690
EVAN, CAN WE PLEASE
TALK ABOUT THIS?

21:40.690 --> 21:42.736
TOLD YOU YESTERDAY
IT WAS OK.

21:42.736 --> 21:45.042
BUT IT'S--IT'S NOT.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.522
IT'S NOT...OK.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.568
I MEAN, I SHOULD
HAVE TOLD YOU.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.526
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T, AND THIS
MAKES IT SEEM

21:50.526 --> 21:52.528
AS THOUGH IT MEANT
SOMETHING TO ME,

21:52.528 --> 21:54.008
WHICH IT REALLY
DIDN'T.

21:54.008 --> 21:56.010
NO, FORGET IT.

21:56.010 --> 21:58.578
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO
UPSET ME.

21:58.578 --> 22:00.014
I UNDERSTAND.

22:00.014 --> 22:01.581
AND I'M NOT--
I'M NOT ANGRY.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.583
OK, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY THAT,
EVAN.

22:03.583 --> 22:06.499
I MEAN, THIS IS...
WELL, IT'S PRETTY
HORRIBLE, AND I--

22:06.499 --> 22:08.892
IT'S NOT HARD
TO EXPLAIN.

22:08.892 --> 22:12.069
YOU'RE HIS AGE.
IT MAKES SENSE,
HIS INTEREST IN YOU.

22:12.069 --> 22:15.072
AND I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT ELSE.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.945
I'M SURE THAT
HE'S ANGRY AT ME...

22:17.945 --> 22:21.252
FOR EVERYTHING
WITH HIS MOM AND FOR
MY BEING WITH YOU.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.735
SO...I'LL CLEAR.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.041
YOU RELAX.

22:38.008 --> 22:41.795
YOU TWO
ARE SO ADORABLE.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.797
OH, HEY! WE SHOULD
GET ONE WITH
THE WHOLE COURT.

22:43.797 --> 22:46.626
OF COURSE. CAN WE
HAVE THE PRINCES AND
PRINCESSES HERE PLEASE?

22:48.454 --> 22:50.978
[OVERLAPPING BANTER]

22:53.241 --> 22:54.285
OH, YES!LOVELY!

22:54.285 --> 22:55.374
NICE!

22:55.374 --> 22:57.506
Girl: LIKING IT?

22:59.769 --> 23:02.859
MAN, THIS CRAP'S
GONNA DRIVE ME
TO DRINK.

23:07.168 --> 23:09.953
LOOK, I KNOW YOU
PROBABLY HATE ME...

23:09.953 --> 23:11.433
WELL...

23:11.433 --> 23:15.045
BUT I TALKED TO
YOUR BROTHER,
AND HE'S COOL.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.047
YEAH, HE TOLD ME
ABOUT IT.

23:17.047 --> 23:18.135
HEY,
SALINGER!

23:18.135 --> 23:19.528
CLAUDIA!COME HERE!

23:19.528 --> 23:21.530
HEY, HEY,
CLAUDIA, COME HERE!

23:21.530 --> 23:24.577
YOU'D BETTER HURRY.
THEY'RE READY FOR
YOUR CLOSE-UP.

23:24.577 --> 23:26.230
HEY.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.104
YOU GOT ENOUGH
OF THAT TO GO
AROUND?

23:30.104 --> 23:31.888
SURE.

23:52.039 --> 23:54.345
HOW DID...YOU...

23:54.345 --> 23:56.696
I WALKED UP
AND DOWN THE BLOCK

23:56.696 --> 24:00.090
UNTIL I FOUND THE CAR
WITH THE MED CENTER
PARKING STICKER ON IT.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.051
I WANTED TO EXPLAIN--

24:04.051 --> 24:06.096
NO, LISTEN, BAILEY,
LOOK,

24:06.096 --> 24:08.011
I'M NOT STORMING
OUT OF YOUR LIFE

24:08.011 --> 24:09.796
IN SOME INDIGNANT
HUFF. YOU KNOW?

24:09.796 --> 24:13.060
I REALLY HAVEN'T
EARNED THE RIGHT.
I MEAN, I BARELY KNOW YOU.

24:13.060 --> 24:15.366
GOD...LOOK, UH...

24:15.366 --> 24:17.543
ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY
IS, UH...

24:17.543 --> 24:20.023
THIS ISN'T...

24:20.023 --> 24:21.938
YOU AREN'T RIGHT
FOR ME.

24:21.938 --> 24:24.941
OK, SO...CAN'T WE
JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT
AND WALK AWAY?

24:24.941 --> 24:27.030
NO. NO.
I DON'T WANT TO.

24:27.030 --> 24:28.423
LISTEN...

24:28.423 --> 24:31.948
I WAS IN
A RELATIONSHIP

24:31.948 --> 24:35.561
FOR 4 YEARS
THAT MEANT PRETTY
MUCH EVERYTHING TO ME.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.214
OK? AND IT JUST ENDED.

24:37.214 --> 24:41.697
AND SO...I FELT LIKE
I JUST NEEDED TO DO
THE OPPOSITE--

24:41.697 --> 24:43.699
WHAT? A RELATIONSHIP
THAT MEANT NOTHING?

24:43.699 --> 24:44.961
EXACTLY.

24:44.961 --> 24:47.137
THE FACT THAT
THIS WOMAN WAS
MARRIED,

24:47.137 --> 24:49.052
THAT SHE WAS
UNAVAILABLE--
MADE IT MORE
EXCITING.

24:49.052 --> 24:51.054
MADE IT POINTLESS.

24:51.054 --> 24:54.188
MADE IT JUST
A STUPID EXERCISE,

24:54.188 --> 24:57.060
JUST A WAY OF GETTING
SARAH OUT OF MY HEAD.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.845
LISTEN, BAILEY...

24:58.845 --> 25:00.542
TO BE HONEST,

25:00.542 --> 25:03.066
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
PROBABLY AN OK GUY.

25:03.066 --> 25:05.591
MORE THAN OK, PROBABLY.

25:05.591 --> 25:08.594
AND YEAH,
I DON'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU MAKE A HABIT

25:08.594 --> 25:11.379
OF HAVING ELICIT AFFAIRS
WITH MARRIED WOMEN.

25:11.379 --> 25:12.728
I DON'T.

25:12.728 --> 25:14.730
BUT YOU'RE STILL
A KID.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.427
A KID.

25:16.427 --> 25:18.429
SEE, I WANT TO BE
WITH SOMEBODY

25:18.429 --> 25:22.042
WHO KNOWS A MEANINGLESS
AFFAIR IS STUPID BEFORE
HE STARTS HAVING ONE.

25:22.042 --> 25:26.089
I DON'T WANT A BOYFRIEND
WHO IS LEARNING ALL HIS
LIFE LESSONS ON MY TIME.

25:26.089 --> 25:27.874
IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE.

25:29.223 --> 25:30.790
SO...

25:30.790 --> 25:33.140
THANK YOU...

25:33.140 --> 25:35.708
FOR A LOVELY DATE.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.145
AND...
HAVE A NICE LIFE.

25:38.145 --> 25:39.712
I GUESS.

25:54.509 --> 25:55.597
HEY.

25:55.597 --> 25:56.816
HEY.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.862
YOU LEAVING?

25:59.862 --> 26:01.168
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:01.168 --> 26:03.170
I'VE GOT A LOT OF
WORK TO DO,

26:03.170 --> 26:06.521
AND I'M SORRY--
I KNOW YOU JUST RENTED
THOSE ALMODOVAR MOVIES,

26:06.521 --> 26:08.131
SO I'M REALLY SORRY.

26:08.131 --> 26:12.353
NO, NO, NO, I--
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.
I UNDERSTAND.

26:17.053 --> 26:18.968
YOU UNDERSTAND?

26:21.101 --> 26:24.670
YEAH. NO PROBLEM.
I'LL JUST RENT 'EM
ANOTHER TIME.

26:24.670 --> 26:25.845
RIGHT.

26:28.151 --> 26:31.459
IT'S NEVER A--A PROBLEM...
IS IT?

26:31.459 --> 26:34.070
WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU UNDERSTAND.WHAT?

26:34.070 --> 26:36.029
I MEAN, HOW IS THAT
POSSIBLE, EVAN?

26:36.029 --> 26:37.900
I MEAN, NO ONE
IS THAT UNDERSTANDING.

26:37.900 --> 26:40.599
JULIA, IS THIS...
ABOUT BRIAN STILL?

26:40.599 --> 26:42.339
NO, IT--IT'S NOT.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.820
IT'S--IT'S...
EVERYTHING...EVAN.

26:44.820 --> 26:47.649
IT'S ABOUT EVERYTHING.

26:47.649 --> 26:52.001
I MEAN, EVERY STEP
OF THE WAY WITH US,
IT'S BEEN THIS.

26:52.001 --> 26:55.657
I HAVE TO FORCE YOU
TO FEEL ANY EMOTION!

26:55.657 --> 26:57.398
I'M NOT UNFEELING.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.487
OK, THEN TO EXPRESS IT.

26:59.487 --> 27:02.577
YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY TELL ME
THAT KNOWING THAT YOUR SON
KISSED YOUR GIRLFRIEND

27:02.577 --> 27:05.145
MADE YOU FEEL NOTHING!

27:05.145 --> 27:06.886
OK.

27:06.886 --> 27:09.845
SO IT BOTHERS ME.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO, JULIA?

27:09.845 --> 27:12.500
DO YOU WANT ME TO
START YELLING
AND SCREAMING?

27:12.500 --> 27:14.023
MAYBE.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD!

27:14.023 --> 27:16.243
YOU WANT ME
TO DRAW A GRAPH

27:16.243 --> 27:19.115
THAT HAS EVERY
SINGLE EMOTION
THAT I FEEL, JULIA?

27:19.115 --> 27:21.204
BECAUSE I'M NOT
THAT KIND OF--

27:21.204 --> 27:24.512
NOT EVERY EMOTION!
EVAN, JUST SOME!

27:24.512 --> 27:28.342
JUST SOME. I WANT...

27:29.691 --> 27:31.084
I WANT...

27:31.084 --> 27:32.868
MORE OF YOU, EVAN.

27:32.868 --> 27:34.870
I WANT YOU TO GIVE
MORE TO ME

27:34.870 --> 27:36.829
THAN YOU WOULD
SOME EDITOR YOU JUST HIRED

27:36.829 --> 27:39.222
OR A BANK TELLER.

27:39.222 --> 27:41.485
'CAUSE OTHERWISE...

27:41.485 --> 27:45.054
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN,
THE TWO OF US, TOGETHER?

27:45.054 --> 27:48.231
SO I GET TO SEE YOU NAKED.
GREAT.

27:48.231 --> 27:51.844
BUT ANYTHING DEEPER THAN THAT
IS OFF LIMITS?

27:51.844 --> 27:54.107
THAT IS NOT...

27:54.107 --> 27:56.805
THAT IS NOT GONNA
WORK FOR ME, EVAN.

27:58.372 --> 28:00.374
IT WON'T WORK.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.209
HEY, CLAUDIA!

28:09.209 --> 28:10.253

SAVED SOME OF THAT
FOR US.

28:16.433 --> 28:19.654
[GIGGLES]
SORRY, IT'S ALL GONE.

28:19.654 --> 28:22.918
GUESS I BETTER GRAB
THAT BOTTLE I STASHED
IN MY LOCKER.

GUY WHEN HE DRINKS.

DRINKING,

28:48.204 --> 28:51.947
SO...THAT EXCUSES
EVERYTHING, DOESN'T IT?

28:51.947 --> 28:53.470
COME ON, CLAUD.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.342
LET'S GO WALK THIS
OFF.

28:55.342 --> 28:57.300
WHOA! WHY, CAMERON?

28:57.300 --> 28:59.563

DON'T, CLAUDIA.

29:01.261 --> 29:02.653
DON'T WHAT?

29:02.653 --> 29:04.655
DON'T SAY WHAT I THINK

29:04.655 --> 29:06.701
OR WHAT I FEEL?

29:06.701 --> 29:08.398
BECAUSE WHY?
BECAUSE THEN WHAT?

29:08.398 --> 29:11.532
GOD FORBID THINGS
MIGHT NOT STAY THE SAME!

29:11.532 --> 29:14.535
I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT IT'S
ALL ABOUT, RIGHT?

29:14.535 --> 29:16.319
WHEN YOU'RE UP
ON THE TOP LOOKING DOWN,

29:16.319 --> 29:18.321
EVERYTHING'S...

29:18.321 --> 29:20.149
IT'S A NICE VIEW.

29:20.149 --> 29:22.456
YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:22.456 --> 29:25.024
I'M SO TIRED...

29:25.024 --> 29:27.156
OF WHAT I'M SEEING.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.431
HEY!

AND HE LEFT ME
A HUGE TIP.

29:58.622 --> 30:00.581
LISTEN, UH...

30:00.581 --> 30:03.714
DO YOU THINK MAYBE
WE COULD...

30:03.714 --> 30:05.847
UH, GO--GO SOMEWHERE

30:05.847 --> 30:08.023
AND TALK OR SOMETHING?

30:08.023 --> 30:10.069
UH...

30:10.069 --> 30:12.985
HOW 'BOUT WE GO
FOR A QUICK RIDE
INSTEAD?

30:12.985 --> 30:14.290
I WAS THINKIN'...

30:14.290 --> 30:16.292
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SOME COFFEE
OR...

30:16.292 --> 30:20.035
COME ON.
JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER
LESSON ON THIS THING.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.429
I THINK I REMEMBER HERE.

30:22.429 --> 30:26.563
YOU TURN THE KEY
AND PRESS THE START BUTTON.

30:26.563 --> 30:29.566
LOOK, I ONLY HAVE
ONE HELMET.

30:29.566 --> 30:32.569
AND, UH...WE REALLY
NEED TO TALK.

30:32.569 --> 30:35.746
CAN WE JUST GO FOR
A QUICK RIDE? PLEASE?

30:38.140 --> 30:41.230
ALL RIGHT.
BUT YOU'RE WEARIN'
THIS.

30:43.015 --> 30:46.801
ALL RIGHT. NOW--
PUT THE KICKSTAND
UP.

30:46.801 --> 30:49.673
ALL RIGHT.
AND THE CLUTCH IN.

30:49.673 --> 30:52.763
ALL RIGHT.
GEAR WITH
YOUR LEFT FOOT.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.765
ALL RIGHT.
NOW WE'RE GONNA

30:54.765 --> 30:57.333
LET OUT ON THE CLUTCH
SLOWLY...SLOWLY, OK?

31:24.970 --> 31:28.016
I, UH...I TRACKED DOWN
GRIFFIN'S FATHER.
HE'S IN GERMANY.

31:29.713 --> 31:31.324
WELL, WE'RE HERE,
RIGHT?

31:31.324 --> 31:33.717
YEAH.

31:33.717 --> 31:36.764
YOU KNOW WHAT HIS DAD
SAID WHEN I TOLD HIM?

31:36.764 --> 31:39.071
HE SAID, "STUPID KID,
NOT WEARING A HELMET."

31:43.118 --> 31:45.468
HEY...HOW ARE THEY?
I HEARD GRIFFIN
WAS--

31:45.468 --> 31:47.340
HE'S STILL IN SURGERY.

31:47.340 --> 31:48.602
AND DAPHNE?

31:48.602 --> 31:50.604
SHE JUST GOT SCRAPED UP
A LITTLE.

31:50.604 --> 31:52.606
THEY'RE KEEPING HER
OVERNIGHT FOR OBSERVATION.

31:52.606 --> 31:53.999
I THINK SHE'S SLEEPING,
BUT--

31:53.999 --> 31:55.870
ARE YOU GRIFFIN HOLBROOK'S
FAMILY?

31:55.870 --> 31:57.045
WE'RE--YEAH.
YEAH, THAT'S US.

31:57.045 --> 31:58.829
HOW IS HE?
IS HE OK?

31:58.829 --> 32:00.875
WELL, HE HAD SOME
INTERCRANIAL BLEEDING,

32:00.875 --> 32:04.183
BUT WE EVACUATED
THE HEMATOMA AND THERE
WAS NO BRAIN DAMAGE.

32:04.183 --> 32:06.402
SO HE'S GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT?

32:06.402 --> 32:09.449
WELL, AS FAR AS HIS
HEAD INJURY GOES,
WE BELIEVE SO.

32:09.449 --> 32:11.494
AS FAR AS HIS HEAD?
WHAT IS THAT?

32:11.494 --> 32:13.018
WAS THERE
SOMETHING ELSE?

32:13.018 --> 32:14.889
WELL, HIS RIGHT HAND
WAS BADLY INJURED--

32:14.889 --> 32:17.892
MULTIPLE FRACTURES,
LACERATIONS OF THE NERVES
AND THE TENDONS.

32:17.892 --> 32:21.461
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
YOU JUST SAID HE
WAS GONNA BE OK.

32:21.461 --> 32:24.507
WELL, HE'LL HAVE TO UNDERGO
RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY...

32:24.507 --> 32:28.207
AND THERE IS A CHANCE
HE WON'T REGAIN THE USE
OF HIS HAND.

32:29.512 --> 32:32.037
SO...WHEN DO YOU
DO THE SURGERY?

32:32.037 --> 32:33.690
WELL, IT'S COMPLICATED.

32:33.690 --> 32:36.432
HE'S UNINSURED,
AND THIS IS A VERY
EXPENSIVE PROCEDURE,

32:36.432 --> 32:38.478
WHICH MEANS AS SOON
AS HE'S STABLE,

32:38.478 --> 32:40.741
WE HAVE TO TRANSFER HIM
TO COUNTY.

32:40.741 --> 32:43.831
CERTAINLY THEY'RE
ADEQUATE, BUT THEY DON'T
HAVE OUR FACILITIES

32:43.831 --> 32:45.659
OR OUR STAFF. SO...

32:45.659 --> 32:47.574
YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDING ME.
HE'D LOSE HIS HAND

32:47.574 --> 32:49.576
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
HAVE INSURANCE?

32:49.576 --> 32:53.101
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T MAKE POLICY.
I DON'T EVEN AGREE WITH IT.

32:53.101 --> 32:54.842
REALLY. I'M SORRY.

32:56.452 --> 32:58.672
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DO THE SURGERY.
WE'LL PAY FOR IT.

32:58.672 --> 33:00.456
JULIA, HOLD ON.

33:00.456 --> 33:03.677
LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS.
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW MUCH--

33:03.677 --> 33:05.418
HE COULD LOSE
HIS HAND, CHARLIE.

33:05.418 --> 33:07.463
THAT'S GRIFFIN'S
WHOLE WAY OF LIFE,
WORKING WITH HIS HANDS.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.552
I'M NOT SAYING
THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO IT.

33:09.552 --> 33:11.946
I THINK WE JUST NEED
TO FIGURE OUT
HOW WE CAN.

33:11.946 --> 33:13.904
DO THE SURGERY.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.608
WE'LL FIND A WAY.

33:26.569 --> 33:29.529
OK. I'LL PUT YOU WITH
OUR ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR

33:29.529 --> 33:32.575
WHILE I PUT A SURGICAL
TEAM TOGETHER.

33:39.713 --> 33:42.585
EXCUSE ME.
I'M LOOKING FOR
A GRIFFIN HOLBROOK.

33:42.585 --> 33:45.153
AM I IN THE RIGHT PLACE?
HE WAS IN A MOTORCYCLE
ACCIDENT.

33:45.153 --> 33:47.199
O.R. 6. THAT WAY.

33:47.199 --> 33:48.200
THIS WAY. THANK YOU.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.288
OOH! SORRY.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.552
HEY...
I DON'T
BELIEVE IT.

33:52.552 --> 33:54.989
YOU'RE FOLLOWING
ME AROUND.
ARE YOU INSANE?

33:54.989 --> 33:56.904
YOU KNOW THAT I CAN
HAVE YOU THROWN OUT
OF HERE.

33:56.904 --> 33:59.559
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU WERE HERE.

33:59.559 --> 34:01.604
SOMEONE I KNOW
WAS IN AN ACCIDENT.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.050
HEY, DAPH.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.008
HEY.

34:14.008 --> 34:15.357
IS, UM...
IS GRIFFIN...

34:15.357 --> 34:17.490
DO THEY KNOW
IF HE, UH...

34:18.578 --> 34:20.101
OH, GOD.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.190
IT'S GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

34:22.190 --> 34:23.539
YOU'RE GONNA BE
FINE.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.846
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

34:30.155 --> 34:32.983
WHAT HAVE I...DONE?

34:43.081 --> 34:44.821
JULIA?

34:46.910 --> 34:48.042
HEY.

34:48.042 --> 34:49.043
HEY.

34:49.043 --> 34:51.524
SO HOW IS HE?
IS HE OK?

34:51.524 --> 34:53.830
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY DON'T KNOW.

34:54.962 --> 34:56.833
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
COME HERE.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.226
NO, NO.
I WANTED TO.

34:58.226 --> 35:00.489
I'M GLAD YOU
CALLED ME.

35:01.708 --> 35:04.102
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I--I, UH...

35:04.102 --> 35:06.887
I--I WANT TO BE
ABLE TO--

35:06.887 --> 35:09.281
TO BE HERE FOR YOU
WHEN...

35:09.281 --> 35:11.544
YOU KNOW, THINGS
LIKE THIS HAPPEN.

35:11.544 --> 35:13.111
I'M NOT GREAT AT IT,
OBVIOUSLY...

35:13.111 --> 35:15.113
EVAN, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

35:15.113 --> 35:17.811
NO, NO, NO!
I DO. I DO.

35:17.811 --> 35:20.901
MY TIME HERE,
IT STINKS,

35:20.901 --> 35:24.296
AND YOU CAN TELL ME
TO SHUT UP ANY TIME
YOU WANT TO, JULIA,

35:24.296 --> 35:26.994
BUT...I HAVE BEEN
THINKING...

35:26.994 --> 35:29.866
AND WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT ME...

35:29.866 --> 35:33.000
I MEAN, IT'S TRUE.
IT'S TRUE.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.743
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
THE FIRST ONE.
YOU SEE, BRIAN,

35:36.743 --> 35:39.702
MY WIFE, YOU KNOW,
THEY'VE ALL SAID
EVERYTHING THAT
YOU'VE SAID,

35:39.702 --> 35:42.401
YOU KNOW, THAT I GET
ALL KINDA BOTTLED UP.

35:42.401 --> 35:45.273
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
ALL SORTS OF EXCUSES--

35:45.273 --> 35:47.928
EVERYONE ELSE.
IT WAS THEIR PROBLEM.

35:50.539 --> 35:53.673
BUT THE TRUTH IS
IS THAT...

35:53.673 --> 35:57.851
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
THAT THERE'S WORK
TO DO.

35:57.851 --> 36:00.245
AND I WANT TO DO IT,
JULIA...

36:00.245 --> 36:03.509
IF YOU COULD JUST
BEAR WITH ME.

36:09.515 --> 36:11.821
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS?

36:13.867 --> 36:17.610
I JUST WROTE
THIS BOOK...

36:17.610 --> 36:20.482
ABOUT MY WHOLE LIFE...

36:20.482 --> 36:25.095
AND NOW I'M FINDING IT
HARD NOT TO NOTICE

36:25.095 --> 36:27.576
THAT I KEEP DOING THIS.

36:29.230 --> 36:33.930
I KEEP...GETTING INVOLVED
WITH GUYS WHO SAY...

36:33.930 --> 36:38.108
"I HAVE A PROBLEM.
BEAR WITH ME."

36:40.720 --> 36:43.766
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE DIFFERENT,

36:43.766 --> 36:48.945
BECAUSE NED, I MEAN,
HE--HE HAD NO CONTROL
OVER HIS FEELINGS.

36:50.512 --> 36:53.123
OR MAYBE I, UH...

36:53.123 --> 36:55.474
MAYBE I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE THE SAME.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.742
BUT THE THING IS,
I, UH...

37:02.742 --> 37:06.615
I CARE SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU.

37:06.615 --> 37:10.097
I MIGHT...
I MIGHT EVEN LOVE YOU.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.624
BUT IT'S TOO MUCH WORK.

37:17.757 --> 37:19.628
IT'S TOO MUCH.

37:21.413 --> 37:24.067
AND I'M SORRY.
I REALLY AM.

37:26.592 --> 37:28.768
BUT I CAN'T ANYMORE.

37:33.468 --> 37:35.296
I CAN'T.

37:52.966 --> 37:54.663
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.406
YEAH.

38:02.541 --> 38:05.544
YOU KNOW, I WAS
LOOKING AT GRIFFIN
LYING THERE,

38:05.544 --> 38:07.720
LYING IN THAT BED,
AND...

38:07.720 --> 38:10.679
NOT TOO LONG AGO,
THAT WAS ME.

38:11.941 --> 38:13.116
I REMEMBER.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.468
AND I PROMISED MYSELF

38:16.468 --> 38:18.513
THAT IF I EVER GOT
OUT OF THERE ALIVE,

38:18.513 --> 38:20.080
I WASN'T GONNA
WASTE TIME

38:20.080 --> 38:22.082
ON THE STUFF THAT
DOESN'T MATTER.

38:23.910 --> 38:26.434
I'M GONNA QUIT TEACHING,
KIRSTEN.

38:26.434 --> 38:28.218
CHARLIE...

38:28.218 --> 38:31.526
YEAH, THE FACTORY
PAYS MORE, AND WE
NEED THAT MONEY.

38:31.526 --> 38:34.616
BUT...YOU LIKE
THE TEACHING BETTER.

38:34.616 --> 38:36.575
THAT'S NOT WHAT
MATTERS NOW.

38:36.575 --> 38:40.318
WHAT MATTERS
THE MOST TO ME
RIGHT NOW

38:40.318 --> 38:41.971
IS MAKING THIS BABY.

38:41.971 --> 38:44.800
THE REST OF IT...

38:44.800 --> 38:46.933
IT'LL COME IN TIME.

38:51.807 --> 38:52.765
ARE YOU SURE?

38:52.765 --> 38:54.549
YEAH.

38:55.855 --> 38:58.248
FUNNY THING IS,
I AM.

39:00.033 --> 39:02.949
THERE'S JUST BEEN
SO MANY TIMES THAT...

39:02.949 --> 39:06.866
I MEAN, WHEN MOM AND DAD
DIED AND I HAD TO PUT
MY WHOLE LIFE ON HOLD,

39:06.866 --> 39:11.261
WHEN YOU WENT AWAY,
WHEN I GOT SICK...

39:11.261 --> 39:15.222
I KEPT...JUST HAVING
TO TRUST FATE,
YOU KNOW?

39:15.222 --> 39:18.486
AND IF I JUST HELD ON,
THE THINGS THAT
I WANTED

39:18.486 --> 39:22.185
WOULD COME BACK TO ME...
AND THEY ALWAYS DID.

39:22.185 --> 39:24.187
AND THEY WILL AGAIN.

39:25.885 --> 39:29.279
IF I JUST HOLD ON...
THEY WILL AGAIN.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.292
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

39:48.908 --> 39:51.998
FUNNY HOW WE KEEP ON
BUMPING INTO
EACH OTHER, HUH?

39:51.998 --> 39:54.348
YEP.

39:56.263 --> 39:59.092
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT
WHAT I SAID BEFORE.

39:59.092 --> 40:00.789
YOU KNOW, DOWNSTAIRS.

40:02.182 --> 40:04.358
IS YOUR FRIEND--

40:04.358 --> 40:06.186
WE'RE STILL WAITING
TO HEAR.

40:06.186 --> 40:07.753
HE'S IN PRETTY BAD
SHAPE, THOUGH.

40:07.753 --> 40:09.929
GOD. MOTORCYCLES.

40:09.929 --> 40:15.151
WHAT, THEY'RE...
TOO OUT OF CONTROL
FOR YOU?

40:16.457 --> 40:18.024
TOO YOUNG?

40:20.113 --> 40:22.942
I'LL KEEP MY FINGERS
CROSSED FOR YOUR FRIEND.

40:22.942 --> 40:25.423
YOU PEGGED ME WRONG,
YOU KNOW.

40:28.034 --> 40:31.777
I'M A LOT OF THINGS
AND NOT ALL OF THEM
GOOD THINGS,

40:31.777 --> 40:33.909
BUT A KID?

40:33.909 --> 40:36.042
I WISH.

40:36.042 --> 40:39.698
I MEAN, IF YOU ONLY KNEW
WHAT THE LAST 6 YEARS OF
MY LIFE HAVE BEEN LIKE...

40:42.135 --> 40:44.877
I MADE A MISTAKE, HOLLY.

40:44.877 --> 40:49.272
AND I'M GONNA MAKE
A LOT MORE BEFORE I'M OLD,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:49.272 --> 40:52.362
YOU RANG MY DOORBELL
BY MISTAKE.

40:52.362 --> 40:56.758
AND I RAN AFTER YOU
LIKE AN IDIOT,
LIKE A KID.

40:56.758 --> 40:59.021
AND I GOT YOU
TO SAY YES.

41:00.414 --> 41:03.765
SO...

41:03.765 --> 41:06.768
SO DON'T TELL ME
THAT THERE ISN'T SOMETHING

41:06.768 --> 41:08.857
THAT'S WORTHWHILE
ABOUT TAKING CHANCES

41:08.857 --> 41:12.557
AND ABOUT BEING RECKLESS
AND SAYING TO HELL WITH
THE CONSEQUENCES,

41:12.557 --> 41:14.472
BECAUSE, HOLLY...

41:14.472 --> 41:16.517
YOU SAID YES.

41:38.887 --> 41:40.933
[GROANS]

41:40.933 --> 41:42.891
GRIFFIN.

41:42.891 --> 41:45.241
HEY.

41:45.241 --> 41:47.243
HEY.

41:47.243 --> 41:49.245
OHH...

41:49.245 --> 41:51.030
OH, IS THERE
SOME WATER?

41:51.030 --> 41:52.727
YEAH.

41:54.337 --> 41:55.513
HERE.

41:58.646 --> 42:00.300
HOW YOU FEELIN'?

42:00.300 --> 42:02.258
I'VE BEEN BETTER.

42:03.651 --> 42:05.218
HOW'S DAPHNE?

42:05.218 --> 42:07.960
SHE'S FINE.

42:09.048 --> 42:11.703
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
ALL NIGHT?

42:11.703 --> 42:13.052
ISN'T THERE
SOMEPLACE THAT--

42:13.052 --> 42:15.271
NO, I--I WANTED
TO STAY HERE.

42:15.271 --> 42:17.099
[COUGHS]

42:21.147 --> 42:22.104
[GROANS] OHH...

42:22.104 --> 42:23.628
THEY, UM...

42:23.628 --> 42:26.108
THEY HAD TO DO
SOME SURGERY ON
YOUR HAND, SO...

42:28.371 --> 42:29.721
IT HURTS LIKE HELL.

42:29.721 --> 42:31.505
I'LL GET THE NURSE.

42:31.505 --> 42:33.289
NO, JULIA.

42:33.289 --> 42:35.248
NO, JUST...

42:35.248 --> 42:38.468
JUST TELL ME,
AM I GONNA BE
OK?

42:39.731 --> 42:42.516
YEAH. YOU'RE GONNA
BE GREAT.

42:42.516 --> 42:45.084
JUST TELL ME, OK?

42:47.260 --> 42:50.263
WELL, THE DOCTOR--
THERE WAS A...

42:50.263 --> 42:53.440
A HAND SURGEON.
SHE'S--SHE'S REALLY
HELPFUL.

42:53.440 --> 42:56.443
BUT I MEAN,
THIS PLACE IS
THE BEST IN THE CITY

42:56.443 --> 42:59.011
FOR THIS KIND OF THING,
SO...

43:02.101 --> 43:04.669
SO THEY DON'T KNOW?

43:07.019 --> 43:09.195
DO THEY?
