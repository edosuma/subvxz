WEBVTT

00:01.433 --> 00:02.501
[rumbling thud]

00:02.503 --> 00:05.471
[groaning]

00:05.473 --> 00:08.173
I don't know why we had
to come 3,000 miles to a jungle,

00:08.175 --> 00:11.510
when we have a perfectly good
jungle gym back at the tower.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.846
Because the tower isn't
where Klaue is conducting

00:13.848 --> 00:15.647
an arms deal
to sell Vibranium.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.616
[Klaue roaring]

00:17.618 --> 00:20.619
This was supposed to be an
easy trade for my Vibranium.

00:20.621 --> 00:24.123
I was told no Avengers.
[humming]

00:24.125 --> 00:26.625
[Citizen V]
But nobody said anything
about Thunderbolts.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.395
Songbird, Meteorite, Atlas,
draw his fire.

00:29.397 --> 00:32.197
Techno, Mach IV,
attack his flank.

00:34.234 --> 00:36.301
[humming]

00:37.904 --> 00:39.571
[grunts]

00:39.573 --> 00:41.206
[groans]

00:41.208 --> 00:43.208
Someone's going to
pay for this,

00:43.210 --> 00:44.710
one way or ano--
[arrow whooshes]

00:44.712 --> 00:46.345
[grunts]

00:46.347 --> 00:49.181
Babysitting wasn't exactly
on my schedule for today.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.849
We're not babysitting,
Hawkeye.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.085
We're lending them a hand.
[groans]

00:55.188 --> 00:58.390
Eight guys against one,
and you think they need a hand?

00:58.392 --> 01:01.260
Yeah, this isn't
a fair fight.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.096
[humming]
[all groaning]

01:13.373 --> 01:15.374
But now it is.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.576
[grunting, groaning]

01:23.616 --> 01:25.584
[grunts]

01:28.521 --> 01:29.755
[groans]

01:29.757 --> 01:31.790
[high-pitched scream]

01:32.859 --> 01:35.461
[groans]

01:35.463 --> 01:36.728
Let's give her
some backup.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.363
Mmm.

01:38.365 --> 01:39.798
[grunts]

01:47.373 --> 01:48.807
They've stopped fighting.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.709
They seem to be attracted
to my shield's Vibranium.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.445
Captain America.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.380
If we corral these
minions together

01:55.382 --> 01:57.649
and I bounce my sonic blast
off your shield,

01:57.651 --> 01:59.418
that might do the trick.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.253
I noticed a cliff wall
not far away.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.721
It might be enough
to trap them.

02:02.723 --> 02:06.325
Eyes open, Cap. She might
be planning a trap for you.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.259
I believe in her.
A person's true nature

02:08.262 --> 02:10.429
will always come out
when put to the test.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.431
How can you be so trusting?

02:12.433 --> 02:14.566
I trust you, don't I?

02:20.306 --> 02:21.673
Now, Songbird.

02:21.675 --> 02:22.808
[screams]

02:29.782 --> 02:33.485
Nicely done.
<i>[Hawkeye] Wasn't there</i>
<i>just a moment there,</i>

02:33.487 --> 02:35.020
<i>where you thought I--</i>
<i>[groans]</i>

02:37.290 --> 02:38.757
[groaning]

02:40.860 --> 02:42.995
[groans]

02:42.997 --> 02:44.997
[Captain America]
Citizen V,
how's he doing that?

02:44.999 --> 02:48.433
Klaue is blasting the Vibranium
with his sonic ray.

02:48.435 --> 02:51.370
<i>It's the perfect alloy</i>
<i>for amplifying his attack.</i>

02:52.605 --> 02:56.608
This never happens
on the jungle gym!

03:09.389 --> 03:10.789
[snickering]

03:11.891 --> 03:13.825
Citizen V,
strike my shield.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.327
[grunts]

03:15.329 --> 03:16.628
[groans]

03:16.630 --> 03:18.564
[all groaning]

03:18.566 --> 03:20.499
Ugh, ow, my head.

03:20.501 --> 03:23.468
Ha! Farewell, heroes.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.646
Relax, you fool.
I'm here to help you.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.748
You can help me
by getting out of my--

03:36.750 --> 03:39.751
Wait a minute.
I've heard that voice.

03:39.753 --> 03:42.321
You're the one who arranged
this weapons trade.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.822
You set me up!

03:43.824 --> 03:45.591
I'm not setting you up.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.925
I'm building you up.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.560
[groans]

03:55.401 --> 03:57.636
[Citizen V]
I've got him, and
the Vibranium is secure.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.508
Nicely done, Thunderbolts.

04:03.510 --> 04:04.810
We'll take it from here.

04:06.746 --> 04:09.715
It's been an honor fighting
beside you, Captain.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.650
Likewise.

04:13.853 --> 04:16.887
So somebody stood Klaue up.
It's probably a good thing.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.589
Anything involving
Wakandan Vibranium

04:18.591 --> 04:20.392
is a recipe for disaster.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.793
And how'd
the Thunderbolts do?

04:21.795 --> 04:23.562
Well, their teamwork
is impressive.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.597
With a little more guidance,
they may really surprise us.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.633
[heavy footsteps]
Where should I put this?

04:27.635 --> 04:29.534
Stick it in one of
the containment vaults

04:29.536 --> 04:31.103
until we can run
further tests.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.705
Looks like Klaue found
a way to use the Vibranium

04:33.707 --> 04:35.641
to duplicate the deflecting
and enhancing abilities

04:35.643 --> 04:38.076
of your shield with
his own sonic blasts.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.646
What do you think, Falcon?
Can we use it to deflect

04:40.648 --> 04:43.415
the sonic vibration
of Hulk's snoring?

04:43.417 --> 04:44.883
Very funny.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.752
[beeping]

04:46.754 --> 04:49.655
[Hawkeye]
Is that supposed
to be happening?

04:49.657 --> 04:51.757
[beeping faster]
Hulk, look out!

04:51.759 --> 04:53.558
[groans]

04:55.495 --> 04:56.628
Huh?

05:03.603 --> 05:05.570
[screaming]

05:07.507 --> 05:09.675
The Vibranium's reacting
to Klaue's sonic powers

05:09.677 --> 05:10.676
and fusing with him.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.848
[groans]
Take out his sonic arm.

05:17.784 --> 05:18.784
[groans]

05:18.786 --> 05:20.485
Sorry, Klaue.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.687
I'm gonna have to
ask you to--
[roars]

05:21.689 --> 05:22.688
[groans]

05:22.690 --> 05:24.523
[grunts]
[grunts]

05:24.525 --> 05:26.792
Ha. You and I--
[shouts]

05:26.794 --> 05:28.627
[groans]

05:28.629 --> 05:30.696
As accurate as ever.

05:30.698 --> 05:31.797
Thanks for the assist.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.632
You know what they say,

05:33.634 --> 05:35.701
the bigger they are,
the harder--

05:35.703 --> 05:37.803
[roars]

05:37.805 --> 05:39.871
They are to keep down.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.441
Klaue get bigger.
[grunts]

05:42.443 --> 05:44.776
Hit harder!
[roars]

05:44.778 --> 05:45.877
[Hulk grunting]

05:45.879 --> 05:47.946
Hulk, wait!
Hulk, hold up!

05:47.948 --> 05:49.781
You're only making it worse.
[groaning]

05:49.783 --> 05:52.718
[roars]
[groans]

05:54.153 --> 05:55.687
[all groan]

05:55.689 --> 05:58.523
[all screaming]

05:59.859 --> 06:01.793
[groans]

06:03.062 --> 06:05.130
Don't worry about Hulk.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.699
[groans]

06:07.701 --> 06:09.701
[crowd shouting]

06:11.471 --> 06:15.240
Now, you will face your doom.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.078
[grunts]

06:20.080 --> 06:22.547
[people screaming]

06:24.917 --> 06:27.719
You wanna fight?
Then come and get it.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.993
[groaning]

06:34.995 --> 06:36.995
Not in the mood to be
a pancake today.

06:36.997 --> 06:37.996
[both grunting]

06:37.998 --> 06:39.965
[groans]

06:42.001 --> 06:45.103
[humming]
[screaming]

06:54.514 --> 06:56.081
Brace yourselves.

06:58.518 --> 07:01.686
[all groaning]

07:02.889 --> 07:04.890
[groans]

07:04.892 --> 07:06.958
[grunting]

07:07.960 --> 07:09.728
[groans]

07:09.730 --> 07:12.864
[Iron Man]
Send me a bill for
the damage, officer.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.132
Uh-oh.

07:16.903 --> 07:18.637
Who?

07:19.972 --> 07:22.607
The Thunderbolts have arrived.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.609
[groaning]

07:25.711 --> 07:28.113
Huh?
[groaning]

07:32.051 --> 07:34.586
We heard there's trouble.
We're here to help.

07:34.588 --> 07:37.055
[grunting]

07:41.093 --> 07:43.762
By what force does
he remain so large?

07:43.764 --> 07:47.065
It's the Vibranium.
It's allowing him to
amplify his powers.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.101
If we can separate
it from him, we can
take him down.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.670
We'll take care of it.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.505
Thunderbolts, strike!

07:53.507 --> 07:55.974
[screaming]

07:56.943 --> 07:59.177
[groaning]

07:59.179 --> 08:02.714
Meteorite, Atlas,
you're up.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.184
[groaning]

08:08.087 --> 08:11.022
[groans]
Huh?

08:17.263 --> 08:18.964
How'd she--

08:18.966 --> 08:20.732
Piece of cake.

08:22.969 --> 08:26.171
I'm scanning for Klaue,
but I don't see any sign of him.

08:28.274 --> 08:30.542
Well, at least not
in a concentration

08:30.544 --> 08:32.210
enough to become
solid matter.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.211
Thank you, Avengers.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.980
Why don't we
take the Vibranium

08:34.982 --> 08:37.048
and run some tests
to see what we can find?

08:37.049 --> 08:40.051
I think we're better
equipped to handle that.

08:40.053 --> 08:43.621
Uh, still,
we'll take care of it.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.191
[reporter]
Hey, look,
it's Citizen V.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.126
One question
at a time.

08:48.128 --> 08:51.229
Just like you'll
take care of all the media?

08:53.165 --> 08:55.200
I still say there's
something fishy here,

08:55.202 --> 08:57.636
but we'll get to
the bottom of it.

09:00.973 --> 09:03.174
And in what is now
becoming an old story,

09:03.176 --> 09:06.144
the Thunderbolts,
once again, saved the city.

09:06.146 --> 09:09.014
<i>Today makes at least</i>
<i>half a dozen times</i>
<i>the Thunderbolts</i>

09:09.016 --> 09:11.950
<i>have done the job we used to</i>
<i>depend on the Avengers for.</i>

09:16.656 --> 09:18.890
<i>It leaves this</i>
<i>reporter wondering...</i>

09:18.892 --> 09:22.327
<i>are the Avengers washed up?</i>

09:22.329 --> 09:25.196
Huh, I look bigger on TV.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.232
You all played
your parts brilliantly.

09:27.234 --> 09:31.036
You did everything required
to outshine the Avengers.

09:31.038 --> 09:34.606
I can't wait to see the look
on Captain America's face

09:34.608 --> 09:36.841
when he realizes
he shook hands

09:36.843 --> 09:38.710
with Baron Zemo.

09:38.712 --> 09:42.714
And he fought alongside
the Masters of Evil.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.683
Be proud of what
you've accomplished.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.184
But--
He's right.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.286
You may be wearing
a Songbird costume

09:48.288 --> 09:51.222
but underneath you're
just Screaming Mimi.

09:51.224 --> 09:55.093
And I'm Fixer, who'll never
be respected by Tony Stark,

09:55.095 --> 09:56.761
no matter what mask I wear.

09:56.763 --> 10:00.398
Exactly. Didn't I give you
the power I promised?

10:00.400 --> 10:03.234
Thanks to me, the world
thinks you're heroes.

10:03.236 --> 10:06.705
Along with a little help
from Tony Stark's
inversion stabilizer.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.807
You'll never matter
as the Thunderbolts

10:08.809 --> 10:11.409
as long as there are
other heroes around.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.612
If you want the world
to praise you,

10:13.614 --> 10:15.413
you have to claim
your rightful place,

10:15.415 --> 10:18.149
and eliminate the Avengers.

10:20.219 --> 10:22.287
Beetle, no.
You're Mach IV.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.289
You were wonderful
out there today.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.459
That wasn't an act, was it?
That was true heroism.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.294
And Meteorite, the way
you took on Klaue,

10:29.296 --> 10:31.429
that was--
that was brave.

10:31.431 --> 10:34.099
Eh, I was just
saving my skin.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.734
Enough of this hero talk.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.636
You'll do as you're told.

10:37.638 --> 10:40.305
Not to mention
that I can expose
all of you right now.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.041
So you see, you really
have no choice.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.180
Guys, I'm picking up another
life sign. We're not alone.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.357
I thought there
was something off
about you guys.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.760
I just didn't know how off.

11:05.131 --> 11:06.197
[screams]

11:08.668 --> 11:10.368
Oh, you've spoiled
our surprise.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.936
But no matter,

11:11.938 --> 11:14.673
we'll just take you out
one at a time.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.207
We're the Avengers.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.343
We don't do anything
one at a time.

11:20.279 --> 11:21.546
[grunting]

11:21.548 --> 11:23.715
[Hawkeye]
Avengers assemble!

11:23.717 --> 11:26.017
Baron Zemo?
And the Thunderbolts?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.453
[Baron Zemo]
Surprised to see me,
Avengers?

11:28.455 --> 11:30.121
You should be.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.223
Once I stole Stark's
inversion stabilizer,

11:32.225 --> 11:33.892
it allowed us
to move among you,

11:33.894 --> 11:35.960
disguising who we really are.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.295
We?

11:37.297 --> 11:39.964
The Masters of Evil!

11:39.966 --> 11:42.300
Is this true?

11:42.302 --> 11:45.003
You cannot even see
what's right before your eyes.

11:45.005 --> 11:48.473
Goliath, Beetle, Fixer,

11:48.475 --> 11:51.910
Moonstone, and of course,
Screaming Mimi.

11:51.912 --> 11:52.977
[grunting]

11:54.480 --> 11:55.547
Ah!

12:02.521 --> 12:03.688
[moans]

12:03.690 --> 12:05.924
[grunting]

12:05.926 --> 12:07.092
[shouts]

12:07.094 --> 12:08.560
[grunting]

12:14.567 --> 12:15.834
[grunts]

12:17.536 --> 12:19.370
Why are you doing
this, Songbird?

12:19.372 --> 12:20.505
Don't call me that.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.273
You know who I really am.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.275
I also know
what I overheard.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.410
[gasps]

12:25.412 --> 12:26.911
[screaming]

12:31.550 --> 12:33.118
[crumbling]

12:33.120 --> 12:34.452
[grunts]

12:34.454 --> 12:36.387
You--you saved me.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.057
I put my life in your hands
back in the jungle,

12:39.059 --> 12:42.093
and I knew you'd do
the right thing.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.461
[Baron Zemo]
Don't be fools!

12:43.463 --> 12:45.730
The Avengers don't trust you.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.232
[grunting]

12:47.234 --> 12:49.267
[grunts]
And Avengers,

12:49.269 --> 12:52.103
the Masters of Evil
betrayed you.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.772
Made a mockery of you.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.106
[grunts]

12:55.108 --> 12:56.374
How many times
will you have

12:56.376 --> 12:59.077
your trust trampled,
Captain America?

12:59.079 --> 13:00.645
[grunting]

13:00.647 --> 13:02.247
Trust isn't a weakness,
Zemo.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.115
It's a barometer
for bravery,

13:04.117 --> 13:06.618
and your team showed me
that they're heroes at heart.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.919
[grunting]
He's right.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.420
Baron Zemo
doesn't trust us.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.755
He's about to rat us out.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.123
It's him
we should be fighting.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.124
[screaming]

13:13.126 --> 13:14.192
No.
[groans]

13:15.795 --> 13:17.729
No one betrays Zemo.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.332
[clicking]

13:22.968 --> 13:24.836
Hey, watch it, Zemo!

13:25.838 --> 13:27.338
Decide your loyalty.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.774
Those who turn against me
will be destroyed.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.075
[grunting]

13:32.077 --> 13:33.745
Hulk, give me a hand!

13:33.747 --> 13:34.813
[grunts]

13:35.781 --> 13:37.315
[grunting]

13:37.317 --> 13:38.716
[grunting]

13:40.085 --> 13:41.186
Thanks for the save.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.321
Yeah, whatever.

13:44.957 --> 13:46.090
[grunts, wails]

13:47.026 --> 13:48.426
[grunts]
[sword slashing]

13:49.461 --> 13:51.162
[thud]
[groans]

13:53.199 --> 13:55.967
[grunts]
We'll take that stabilizer.

13:55.969 --> 13:59.003
You know what?
We're done playing
these parts.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.639
It's time to live these parts.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.308
Thunderbolts, strike!

14:03.310 --> 14:04.809
[weapons firing]
[grunting]

14:04.811 --> 14:06.010
[screaming]

14:07.546 --> 14:08.680
[screaming]

14:09.982 --> 14:12.217
[laughing]

14:14.286 --> 14:16.387
I collected
the particles of Klaue

14:16.389 --> 14:18.990
and now his powers
are mine to control.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.725
[shouts, grunts]

14:20.727 --> 14:22.293
[explosion]
[grunts]

14:25.898 --> 14:28.666
Klaue used this Vibranium
to immobilize you,

14:28.668 --> 14:31.836
but I'll use it
to tear you apart!

14:31.838 --> 14:34.305
[humming]
[all groaning]

14:34.307 --> 14:37.342
I wish I could stay
and watch you turn into dust,

14:37.344 --> 14:40.044
but I have
an announcement to make,

14:40.046 --> 14:41.479
and a world to conquer.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.448
[laughing]
[whooshing]

14:46.318 --> 14:48.987
[humming]

14:48.989 --> 14:51.856
Figures, just when we go
all in on this hero thing,

14:51.858 --> 14:53.925
our luck runs out.

14:55.261 --> 14:57.962
[humming]
[all groaning]

14:58.898 --> 15:00.598
We're not finished yet.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.433
Use my shield
to strengthen your power.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.903
It's Vibranium.
Use it to focus the blast.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.170
[screaming]

15:11.510 --> 15:12.777
[explosion]

15:14.914 --> 15:15.980
[exhales]

15:17.216 --> 15:19.083
Zemo said something
about an announcement,

15:19.085 --> 15:21.619
so I have a pretty good idea
where to find him.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.255
Then let's go show the world
his true colors.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.623
[Citizen V]
People of New York,

15:25.625 --> 15:26.958
it is with a heavy heart

15:26.960 --> 15:28.459
that I inform you
that the Avengers

15:28.461 --> 15:30.795
and the Thunderbolts
are no more.

15:30.797 --> 15:34.799
I, Citizen V, am
your only hero left.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.301
[people chattering]

15:36.303 --> 15:38.603
But I promise you,

15:38.605 --> 15:42.573
they fought valiantly
to their last breath.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.243
The heavy burden
of responsibility

15:45.245 --> 15:48.079
now falls on my shoulders.
<i>[chirping]</i>

15:48.081 --> 15:49.714
<i>[Hawkeye] Anyone miss us?</i>
Huh?

15:49.716 --> 15:54.118
[Citizen V]
What? No, no, no, no!

15:54.120 --> 15:56.054
[people cheering]

15:56.056 --> 15:58.122
You always did
speak too soon.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.393
Now, the world can see
who you really are, Zemo.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.462
[people gasping]

16:04.464 --> 16:08.132
[shouts]
[people screaming]

16:08.134 --> 16:09.667
[grunts]

16:09.669 --> 16:10.735
[screams]

16:15.107 --> 16:17.275
[all screaming]

16:17.277 --> 16:19.677
Thanks to Klaue's particles,

16:19.679 --> 16:21.612
I am more
than just Baron Zemo.

16:21.614 --> 16:24.215
Much, much more!

16:26.285 --> 16:28.720
Avengers, keep
that building standing.

16:35.260 --> 16:36.661
[shredding]

16:36.663 --> 16:37.996
We're gonna crash.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.835
[grinding]

16:43.837 --> 16:45.003
[crashing]

16:47.006 --> 16:48.272
[people gasping]

16:49.174 --> 16:50.441
[screaming]

16:55.314 --> 16:56.881
I gotcha, Songbird.

16:58.150 --> 16:59.183
Catch that jet.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.885
They can't hold it for long.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.355
[grunting]

17:05.624 --> 17:07.191
[grunts]
I got it!

17:08.227 --> 17:10.560
[grunting]
[engine dies]

17:13.665 --> 17:15.665
[brakes screeching]

17:15.667 --> 17:16.901
Thunderbolts,

17:16.903 --> 17:18.903
if we're gonna
be heroes now,

17:18.905 --> 17:21.271
let's start by
bringin' in Zemo.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.281
[groans]

17:33.185 --> 17:34.252
[grunts]

17:38.257 --> 17:39.857
You dare to fight me?

17:39.859 --> 17:41.659
Then fight both of us.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.899
Did he just say,
"both of us"?

17:50.235 --> 17:51.536
[explosion]

17:51.538 --> 17:53.905
[roaring]

17:57.676 --> 18:00.211
[Iron Man]
Avengers, Thunderbolts,

18:00.213 --> 18:03.548
Klaue's back
and bigger than ever.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.450
[humming]

18:09.254 --> 18:11.289
[screaming]

18:11.291 --> 18:13.925
[thud]
[grunts]

18:16.695 --> 18:19.297
Guess we're even.
Whatever.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.300
[firing]
[grunts]

18:24.736 --> 18:25.803
[shouts]

18:31.477 --> 18:33.311
[firing]
[groaning]

18:39.651 --> 18:43.254
Songbird, how do you feel
about putting this guy in jail?

18:43.256 --> 18:45.890
Ah, music to my ears.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.292
[deeply inhales, screams]

18:55.400 --> 18:57.401
[grunts]
I'm just feedin' him.

18:57.403 --> 18:58.469
[whooshing]

18:59.738 --> 19:01.739
Songbird, how 'bout
one more time,

19:01.741 --> 19:03.274
with feeling.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.408
[screaming]

19:07.813 --> 19:09.380
[groaning]

19:11.350 --> 19:12.683
[groaning]

19:16.321 --> 19:18.489
Unleash everything
we've got.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.323
All together.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.059
[yells]

19:22.995 --> 19:24.495
[crashing]
[groans]

19:24.497 --> 19:25.863
[screaming]

19:29.334 --> 19:31.836
[muffled roaring]

19:31.838 --> 19:33.538
[rumbling]

19:33.540 --> 19:36.274
[muffled groaning]

19:36.276 --> 19:38.042
It's workin'.
Pour it on.

19:42.281 --> 19:43.781
[whimpering]

19:43.783 --> 19:45.550
Hands off, Klaue.

19:48.620 --> 19:49.987
[muffled screaming]

19:49.989 --> 19:51.389
[screaming]

20:04.570 --> 20:05.803
Songbird, now!

20:05.805 --> 20:07.004
[grunting]

20:10.576 --> 20:12.677
Yeah, I think she's got it.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.345
Brace yourselves.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.547
[explosion]

20:24.856 --> 20:26.490
Away with you!

20:26.492 --> 20:28.459
[explosion]

20:31.663 --> 20:33.598
Great job, hero.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.865
Now to get-- Ooh.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.934
Hey, where's Zemo?

20:36.936 --> 20:40.137
The Klaue particles he absorbed
must've been scattered too.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.441
So he's gone for good?

20:43.443 --> 20:44.675
I wouldn't count on it.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.577
Hmm.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.447
I could use a sword.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.681
Hey, come on!
[laughs]

20:50.683 --> 20:52.416
[grunting]
Is he always like that?

20:52.418 --> 20:53.684
Hey, whoa!

20:53.686 --> 20:55.519
Have at thee.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.724
How about we all stick
with what we're best at?

20:59.726 --> 21:03.728
Aww, I'd already
named him Swordy.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.696
I'd say what
the Thunderbolts are best at

21:05.698 --> 21:07.598
is fighting
on the side of good.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.401
Oh, thanks, but, uh,

21:10.403 --> 21:12.703
I guess if we're gonna stick
with this good guy plan,

21:12.705 --> 21:13.871
we'll probably need
some work.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.040
Well, if you're serious,
I know a place

21:16.042 --> 21:18.442
where you can get
some real training,

21:18.444 --> 21:20.378
if you turn yourselves in.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.780
Yeah, I guess I'd
be up for that.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.715
But you will see us again,

21:24.717 --> 21:25.816
as real heroes.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.718
And showin'
who we really are.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.954
That, I believe.
