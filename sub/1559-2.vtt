[Grunts]

00:05.626 --> 00:08.025
Tell me again how you
don't need a guardi...

00:08.050 --> 00:09.503
- Aah!
- Flynn!

00:09.527 --> 00:12.224
- That wound is bad.
- Excalibur.

00:12.249 --> 00:14.601
Lamia got the crown, and she
had control over Excalibur.

00:14.624 --> 00:16.850
- Let me treat the bleeding.
- You can't treat it. It's a magical wound.

00:16.867 --> 00:19.249
- I need, um...
- W... what are you... wait!

00:19.273 --> 00:20.466
We got to go
find Cassandra!

00:20.491 --> 00:22.249
No. She's the one
who let them in. Aah!

00:22.272 --> 00:25.227
Well, my lack of faith
in humanity is restored.

00:28.485 --> 00:29.244
[Shudders]

00:29.269 --> 00:30.394
Ugh!

00:30.419 --> 00:31.611
Yeah, that's better.

00:31.636 --> 00:32.600
That helps the pain.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.473
- The bleeding stopped.
- Slowed, not stopped.

00:34.498 --> 00:36.387
Bathsheba's oil
of healing.

00:36.412 --> 00:39.084
If it had been an ordinary wound, it would
have stopped it, but it's a magical wound,

00:39.105 --> 00:41.203
so it's gonna slow it long enough
so that we can find Charlene.

00:41.228 --> 00:42.639
I... I passed her
in the shelves.

00:42.664 --> 00:45.088
She said, uh, something about
meeting her deep in The Library,

00:45.111 --> 00:46.916
something about the
corridor of doors.

00:47.543 --> 00:49.184
Come on, let's go. Go!

Any artifacts which can move...
prep them for transport.

01:01.978 --> 01:02.868
Man: Yes, ma'am.

01:03.252 --> 01:04.533
Man #2: Get going, let's go!

01:04.557 --> 01:06.799
Did you really
have to do that?

01:06.814 --> 01:10.608
You've seen the power the Librarians
are hiding down here,

01:10.631 --> 01:14.725
how much knowledge is locked away far
from the people it can help the most.

01:14.748 --> 01:17.631
So you're telling me that
you're the good guys.

01:17.654 --> 01:20.599
We're going to use The Library's
powers to change the world.

01:21.222 --> 01:22.338
Man: Let's go.

01:24.609 --> 01:25.858
Come on! Hurry!

01:30.155 --> 01:31.492
Ezekiel: How big
is this library?

01:31.517 --> 01:32.982
Flynn: As big as
we need it to be.

01:33.007 --> 01:34.765
[Bell tolling]

01:35.180 --> 01:37.493
Oh, no.
That's the countdown clock.

01:37.512 --> 01:39.813
Flynn, what happens
when the bell stops?

01:39.836 --> 01:41.453
Charlene, no!

01:51.422 --> 01:52.749
Come on, let's go!

01:53.437 --> 01:55.577
What do you mean "The Library is
cut off from the outside world"?

01:55.602 --> 01:59.024
Lamia: Get out! Grab what
you can and get out!

01:59.039 --> 02:00.743
You mean like
locked doors?

02:00.767 --> 02:02.794
Look around you, girl!

02:02.802 --> 02:06.535
Can anything this big really just lie
underneath the streets of New York City?

02:06.560 --> 02:11.379
The Library exists in its own pocket
dimension anchored to our reality here.

02:11.404 --> 02:13.629
At this single
physical place.

02:13.654 --> 02:16.374
And the first Librarian
just cut the anchor chain.

02:18.822 --> 02:21.914
[Bell tolling]

02:21.939 --> 02:23.440
- What now?
- Four bells.

02:23.861 --> 02:26.532
I don't know. I've never been
this deep in The Library before.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.062
That's three bells.

02:28.087 --> 02:29.219
Charlene... she'll
know what to do.

02:29.244 --> 02:31.408
- She's not coming.
- All right, Judson. He's always here!

02:31.430 --> 02:34.016
- He's not coming!
- Two bells. Pick a door!

02:36.121 --> 02:38.025
[Crashing]

02:39.409 --> 02:40.909
[Bell tolls]

02:51.237 --> 02:53.298

02:53.976 --> 02:55.317

Charlene?!

[Birds chirping]

03:06.401 --> 03:07.927
Where are we?

03:07.952 --> 03:09.627
When are we?

03:09.651 --> 03:11.674
It's day. We
time-traveled.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.590
Time travel. Ugh!

03:15.198 --> 03:17.770
Time travel's not all
it's cracked up to be.

03:19.718 --> 03:21.784
Hey! Blood. Mine.

03:21.809 --> 03:23.114
It's crimson.

03:23.987 --> 03:25.652
I need to eat
more calcium.

03:26.717 --> 03:27.380
Whoa.

03:27.405 --> 03:30.624
Let's not panic. There's a logical way
to approach being trapped in the past.

03:30.649 --> 03:31.547
Okay.

03:31.572 --> 03:34.322
We find the local king, tell
him about our powerful magic,

03:34.347 --> 03:36.863
invent a steam engine,
and he gives us a duchy.

03:36.888 --> 03:39.747
Eventually, we use our superior
technology to take over the land.

03:39.772 --> 03:42.436
I hate to break it to you
King Jones the first,

03:42.459 --> 03:45.217
but I got cell service,
American carrier.

03:45.224 --> 03:47.792
Of course. We didn't
travel through time.

03:47.817 --> 03:49.451
We traveled through space.
We came west.

03:49.476 --> 03:51.795
It's still night in New York.
The sun's still up on the west coast.

03:51.820 --> 03:53.672
GPS coming online.

03:53.687 --> 03:56.718
Latitude would put
us exactly...

03:56.726 --> 03:58.080
in...

03:58.105 --> 03:58.949
- Oregon.
- Oregon.

03:58.974 --> 04:00.870
See? I still got it. Ooh!

04:01.095 --> 04:02.343
We got to get him
to a hospital.

04:02.368 --> 04:04.707
Road's this way. Don't
see a hospital, though.

04:05.138 --> 04:08.138
- He's bleeding real bad.
- Well, we better get a move on, then.

04:12.872 --> 04:14.217
Hi.

04:14.235 --> 04:15.587
Howdy.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.577
Your friend does
not look well.

04:17.601 --> 04:19.838
- You need a ride?
- I'm... I'm Colonel Eve Baird.

04:19.863 --> 04:22.130
Uh, do you mind if we
explain in the car?

04:22.153 --> 04:25.403
No need to talk. I hate to pry
into people's business.

04:26.212 --> 04:28.891
- What were you doing out here?
- Waiting.

04:29.587 --> 04:30.924
I do that.

04:34.028 --> 04:36.228
[Engine turns over]

04:44.512 --> 04:47.685
Hang in there, Flynn. How
far to the hospital?

04:48.219 --> 04:50.227
Hospital? Oh,
no, no, no, no.

04:50.252 --> 04:52.486
Why would we take
him to a hospital?

04:52.507 --> 04:54.167
We're almost there.

05:05.671 --> 05:07.247
Wait, wait, wait.
We need a hospital.

05:07.272 --> 05:09.007
He's been stabbed.
He's bleeding out.

05:09.030 --> 05:10.960
Hospital won't
do him any good.

05:11.303 --> 05:14.853
Wounds caused by Excalibur
don't heal. Magic.

05:22.311 --> 05:25.221
Flynn: So... Wait a second.

05:25.246 --> 05:26.746
How do you know
about Excalibur?

05:26.771 --> 05:30.615
Please forgive the dust. Hasn't
been used in ages, of course.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.859
And how do you know
about magic? Aah!

05:37.337 --> 05:39.637
I know all about
you, Flynn Carsen.

05:39.662 --> 05:41.288
I don't understand.

05:42.174 --> 05:43.272
What is this place?

05:43.297 --> 05:45.743
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

05:45.768 --> 05:48.877
Jenkins, of course.
As far as this place...

05:51.045 --> 05:52.772
Well...

05:54.427 --> 05:55.304
[Snaps fingers]

05:59.900 --> 06:01.794
You're in The Library.

06:05.567 --> 06:07.098
[Gasps]

06:08.981 --> 06:10.515
Jenkins: Aww.

06:16.301 --> 06:18.871
Say, you wouldn't happen to
have a cold beer, would you?

06:18.896 --> 06:21.529
Uh, no, a... as this
is The Library

06:21.554 --> 06:24.490
and not a rodeo
or a hobo camp

06:24.515 --> 06:27.703
or wherever it is people
like you gather in crowds.

06:30.552 --> 06:32.872
- Mnh-mnh. Don't... don't... don't...
don't move too much. - Ow!

06:32.896 --> 06:34.979
What are you stuffing that with?
Duct tape?

06:35.004 --> 06:37.129
- Glue?
- Y... yes, actually.

06:37.144 --> 06:38.629
- The bleeding won't stop.
- No, it won't stop.

06:38.652 --> 06:41.018
It's a magical wound
from Excalibur.

06:41.043 --> 06:42.168
[Sighs]

06:43.920 --> 06:46.201
Oh! God! What... Oh!

06:47.006 --> 06:49.217
Don't touch anything!

06:49.964 --> 06:51.301
I think you broke Africa.

06:51.326 --> 06:55.459
This is my workplace, not Judson's,
and I'm doing very important research.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.308
We're in The Library?
[Groans]

06:57.333 --> 06:58.085
Aah!

06:58.107 --> 06:59.201
Judson!

07:00.002 --> 07:01.599
Charlene?

07:05.462 --> 07:07.673
- Where's The Library?
- No, no, no, this is the same room.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.703
Hey, I swear this
is the same room.

07:09.728 --> 07:11.119
Yes.

07:11.144 --> 07:13.144
Of course it is.

07:14.263 --> 07:19.186
The main Library can only ever be anchored
to one specific place in the world.

07:19.209 --> 07:22.969
What if the Librarian needed to gain
access to The Library's knowledge

07:22.994 --> 07:24.953
but was far from
the front door?

07:24.961 --> 07:26.380
This is an interface.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.851
Judson ran The Library while
you were out here in an annex.

07:28.876 --> 07:31.892
Yes. Separate but

07:31.917 --> 07:34.230
connected. Oh.

07:34.964 --> 07:38.040
Name a book, something you know
is only in the main Library.

07:38.063 --> 07:41.003
Isaac Newton's
"Principia Mathematica,"

07:41.019 --> 07:43.033
the unedited version.

07:44.613 --> 07:48.055
Section "F," row
9, shelf AA2.

07:48.078 --> 07:51.026
Right behind the little
shifty-looking fellow.

07:54.471 --> 07:58.019
[Magical tinkling]

07:59.658 --> 08:03.667
"The Mathematical Principles
of Natural Philosophy

08:03.682 --> 08:07.268
as Derived by the Wondrous
Thinking Machines of Atlantis"?

08:07.283 --> 08:09.065
Like I said, the
unedited version.

08:09.090 --> 08:13.848
Jenkins: I am afraid, as Judson
has cut the connection

08:13.870 --> 08:18.080
of The Library to the physical
world, this room is all we have.

08:18.105 --> 08:23.261
Access to information but no way
in or out of the main Library.

08:23.283 --> 08:25.588
Ugh, typical Judson.
So rash.

08:25.603 --> 08:27.814
Hey, watch your tone when
you speak about Judson.

08:27.830 --> 08:29.619
Well, Judson and I never
agreed on anything.

08:29.641 --> 08:32.498
I mean, I realize that The Library
is best used for research,

08:32.520 --> 08:36.700
not for gallivanting about, fighting
monsters, seducing princesses.

08:37.293 --> 08:38.557
I'm guessing, with
that attitude,

08:38.572 --> 08:40.822
that's why you're probably stuck
out here in the annex, huh?

08:40.845 --> 08:42.402
Not at the home office?

08:43.596 --> 08:45.670
Very happy here.
It's quiet.

08:45.695 --> 08:48.557
I can focus on my work,
not bothered by...

08:50.726 --> 08:53.316
The greatest collection
of magic in the world.

08:56.867 --> 08:58.552
I should have
seen it coming.

08:59.454 --> 09:00.813
Cassandra.

09:01.197 --> 09:02.963
They had leverage on her.

09:03.465 --> 09:05.863
Should have seen it.
I should have seen all of it.

09:07.451 --> 09:09.597
Why didn't Judson warn me?

09:09.622 --> 09:12.483
Maybe Judson trusted you to
figure it out on your own.

09:12.508 --> 09:15.529
How could I not see that they
were killing Librarians?

09:20.732 --> 09:23.101
People are dead because I
just wasn't good enough.

09:23.126 --> 09:25.517
- You're opening your wound.
- It doesn't matter.

09:25.537 --> 09:27.190
It's a magical wound.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.691
It won't ever heal.

09:32.412 --> 09:34.207
I'm going to die.

09:35.917 --> 09:37.106
Tell them.

09:37.834 --> 09:38.903
[Sighs]

09:38.928 --> 09:40.266
Tell me what?

09:44.248 --> 09:47.280
I can pump him full of fluids,
but if he keeps bleeding...

09:50.278 --> 09:51.752
24 hours.

09:52.689 --> 09:54.816
He's dead in 24 hours.

09:54.841 --> 09:58.055
Yeah, um... Isn't he
supposed to be in charge?

10:00.010 --> 10:02.010
Yeah, this is not good.

10:04.032 --> 10:05.642
Cassandra!

10:05.657 --> 10:11.099
So glad you managed to avoid the insane
suicide plan of the Librarians.

10:11.124 --> 10:12.297
Do you know if the
others got out?

10:12.322 --> 10:14.697
Ezekiel and Stone?
[Chuckles]

10:14.712 --> 10:16.385
Well, I dearly hope so.

10:16.408 --> 10:19.261
You see the lengths the
Librarians will go to

10:19.284 --> 10:22.272
to hide the gift of
magic from the world?

10:22.297 --> 10:25.049
Destroy anything, anyone,

10:25.605 --> 10:27.407
to keep their secrets.

10:27.992 --> 10:29.787
If you can cure me...

10:31.101 --> 10:33.590
When the key is
joined to the lock...

10:34.299 --> 10:38.166
and magic is returned
to the world...

10:42.006 --> 10:44.593
we can absolutely
cure you.

10:46.128 --> 10:47.691
You have to share it.

10:47.716 --> 10:50.896
You have to help all of the people
that science can't save.

10:50.912 --> 10:53.647
Cassandra, that's
why you're here...

10:54.474 --> 10:56.961
to help us bring magic
back to the world

10:56.984 --> 10:59.922
and help those who cannot
be helped by other means.

11:02.317 --> 11:04.317
We're going to
change the world.

11:05.172 --> 11:06.449
Now...

11:07.611 --> 11:09.846
You best get
some rest, hmm?

11:17.347 --> 11:18.339
[Door closes]

11:18.363 --> 11:20.074
Why'd you stop me?

11:21.973 --> 11:23.612
New rug.

11:24.323 --> 11:27.104
And even with Excalibur,
there are bound to be

11:27.119 --> 11:29.823
impediments
accessing the lock.

11:30.186 --> 11:34.314
Having a Librarian... even half
a Librarian... may prove useful.

11:36.203 --> 11:37.742
But mostly the rug.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.682
I need Flynn to
pull it together.

11:51.740 --> 11:54.575
I... I'm too new
to this world.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.318
Well, then you need to go
and pull him together.

11:57.343 --> 11:58.937
You're his guardian.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.416
That means more than
merely keeping him alive.

12:01.431 --> 12:04.304
It means keeping him in one piece,
both mentally and physically.

12:04.329 --> 12:05.433
[Scoffs]

12:05.706 --> 12:07.722
Didn't do a great
job of that.

12:08.170 --> 12:09.795
So he got stabbed.

12:10.408 --> 12:16.066
Librarians get stabbed and shot
and bitten and cursed all the time.

12:17.539 --> 12:19.408
He's gonna die.

12:20.460 --> 12:21.242
Soon.

12:21.265 --> 12:24.978
We're all gonna die soon
if you don't get in there.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.638
Now, look, guardian, if
he fell into a river,

12:27.653 --> 12:30.406
you would reach in and
pull him out... Yes?

12:30.431 --> 12:32.388
Before he could drown.

12:32.778 --> 12:34.375
Judson

12:34.400 --> 12:37.765
was everything to Flynn,
as was Charlene,

12:37.790 --> 12:40.611
who, quite frankly, I
always liked better.

12:40.636 --> 12:42.054
To lose them both?

12:42.600 --> 12:45.227
Right now, he is drowning.

12:45.726 --> 12:47.369
Right now.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.361
Go save him.

13:01.139 --> 13:02.657
Flynn?

13:37.787 --> 13:43.374
"Higher dimensional quantum
translocation theory."

13:44.676 --> 13:46.086
By Albert Einstein.

13:46.101 --> 13:47.406
Original edition.

13:47.431 --> 13:49.386
I think--

13:49.401 --> 13:52.102
I think I figured out a way
back to The Library.

13:53.597 --> 13:55.778
Is that really where
we should be going?

13:56.681 --> 13:58.279
Yeah. We... we've
got tools there.

13:58.294 --> 14:01.523
We've got artifacts. We've got
resources that we're gonna need

14:01.524 --> 14:03.570
if we're gonna fight the
Serpent Brotherhood.

14:07.211 --> 14:08.742
In the few days we've
known each other,

14:08.767 --> 14:13.197
I haven't seen you
use any tools or

14:14.041 --> 14:16.028
magical equipment or...

14:16.756 --> 14:18.425
or artifacts...

14:18.949 --> 14:20.638
Just your brain.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.660
That's why Judson
chose you, right?

14:27.839 --> 14:28.759
[Page rustles]

14:28.784 --> 14:31.768
Your brain is a weapon

14:31.789 --> 14:33.808
and a tool

14:33.833 --> 14:36.536
and a library all
wrapped up into one.

14:37.568 --> 14:40.630
Judson chose you
because in the end,

14:40.655 --> 14:42.655
you don't need anything.

14:46.091 --> 14:48.182
Yeah, but Charlene
could still be alive.

14:48.207 --> 14:51.939
Ju... Judson could still... the right
thing to do is to find The Library.

14:51.964 --> 14:54.133
If that were the right
thing to do, Flynn Carsen,

14:54.158 --> 14:56.174
you'd be doing it, not
reading about it.

14:56.195 --> 15:00.292
No. No. This is
your way of hiding.

15:03.245 --> 15:05.104
I bet--

15:05.120 --> 15:08.026
I bet that's what you were
like before all this.

15:08.931 --> 15:10.689
You hid in books.

15:12.175 --> 15:14.645
That's the life from
which Judson pulled you.

15:15.841 --> 15:17.553
That's what you were.

15:19.407 --> 15:21.116
Judson and Charlene...

15:23.703 --> 15:26.120
they made you
what you are.

15:33.945 --> 15:34.948
Oh.

15:35.538 --> 15:37.779
I'm gonna be
dead tomorrow.

15:42.125 --> 15:45.685
So, how would they want you
to spend your last day?

15:53.297 --> 15:56.068
They'd want me to save
the world one more time.

15:59.991 --> 16:02.100
So, tell me, Librarian,

16:02.125 --> 16:04.125
how are you gonna do that?

16:07.024 --> 16:08.653
You...

16:10.323 --> 16:11.813
are...

16:14.051 --> 16:15.611
key!

16:17.263 --> 16:19.096
[Laughs]

16:20.111 --> 16:22.312
I am "henge" and "key."

16:22.636 --> 16:26.072
She said "key"! She
called Excalibur a key.

16:26.095 --> 16:28.608
She didn't say "sword."
She didn't say "weapon."

16:28.633 --> 16:30.937
She said "key." And think about it.
You're the Serpent Brotherhood.

16:30.952 --> 16:32.434
If you want to bring magic
back into the world,

16:32.459 --> 16:34.647
how are you gonna do that
with just one sword?

16:34.662 --> 16:36.037
Excalibur's
pretty powerful.

16:36.056 --> 16:39.698
Stone: It's still just a sword. I mean,
Excalibur against a tank, an F-15?

16:39.722 --> 16:43.144
- I'm betting on the military.
- That's right. It's not an end goal.

16:43.167 --> 16:45.928
It's a key. Now, what
does a key do, Jones?

16:45.953 --> 16:47.109
- Goes in a lock.
- That's right.

16:47.117 --> 16:49.941
And we all remember the legend.
Excalibur was locked in once before.

16:49.956 --> 16:51.402
It had to be pulled free.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.819
You must be feeling better.
You're not making any sense.

16:53.844 --> 16:55.890
The stone. Uh,
the legend is...

16:55.915 --> 16:57.157
Arthur pulled Excalibur
from the stone.

16:57.178 --> 16:59.007
After it had been
charged with magic.

16:59.029 --> 17:00.509
And where is that
stone, Stone?

17:00.534 --> 17:02.258
Stone: If Arthur
was Roman,

17:02.282 --> 17:04.377
it'd be at the biggest empire
settlement in Britain,

17:04.400 --> 17:06.492
Londinium...
modern London.

17:06.913 --> 17:09.412
Ha! Look.

17:09.436 --> 17:13.242
There's a big Ley Line
running right underneath it.

17:14.119 --> 17:16.213
Come on. Let's go
get that stone.

17:16.238 --> 17:17.878
Whoa. Us too?

17:20.531 --> 17:23.954
Well, they've got the most
powerful weapon in the world.

17:24.628 --> 17:26.106
Judson's gone.
Charlene's gone.

17:26.121 --> 17:27.771
The Library's gone. I'm
bleeding to death.

17:27.796 --> 17:30.825
So, yeah, working alone doesn't
seem like the best idea right now.

17:30.849 --> 17:33.076
Good. You're leaving. I
can get back to my work.

17:33.090 --> 17:34.749
Jenkins, book us
tickets to London.

17:34.773 --> 17:36.553
I'd do it myself, but...

17:37.040 --> 17:38.638
[Straining] I'm dying.

17:42.306 --> 17:44.020
Hey. Excuse me.

17:44.045 --> 17:45.943
You didn't turn off
the glowing globe.

17:45.968 --> 17:47.484
You got...

17:48.603 --> 17:49.817
[Sighs]

17:51.100 --> 17:52.524
Hope it's on a timer.

17:58.617 --> 18:00.776
Flynn: There's a magical
stone out there somewhere.

18:00.801 --> 18:02.512
Got about 12 hours
before I'm dead,

18:02.535 --> 18:05.268
and the end of the world will
probably come before that.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.195
- Full day ahead.
- How do we find the stone?

18:07.220 --> 18:08.530
What we need is a compass.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.674
The stone that Excalibur was
pulled from is almost pure magic.

18:11.697 --> 18:13.705
It should attract any other
magic item in the city.

18:13.721 --> 18:16.789
Let's just take another magic
artifact, rig it into the compass.

18:16.814 --> 18:17.884
[Snaps fingers]
Piece of cake.

18:17.903 --> 18:20.330
It is a piece of cake, because
I know just the artifact.

18:30.108 --> 18:32.794
Man: <i>This way, please.
Step this way.</i>

18:32.819 --> 18:36.681
<i>Now, the imperial state
crown was made in 1937...</i>

18:40.395 --> 18:41.312
The Crown Jewels?

18:41.335 --> 18:42.585
We are not...

18:42.610 --> 18:44.237
[Breathes deeply]

18:45.116 --> 18:48.953
We are not stealing the crown
jewels of the British monarchy.

18:48.972 --> 18:50.544
Of course not.

18:51.366 --> 18:53.179
We're stealing that one.

18:53.204 --> 18:55.092
The star of Marrakesh.

18:55.099 --> 18:59.024
John Dee used it to save the life of
Elizabeth I from magical assassination.

18:59.047 --> 19:00.558
Actually, really
funny story...

19:00.583 --> 19:02.820
So, we're not stealing
the crown jewels.

19:02.835 --> 19:06.775
We're stealing the priceless artifact
from right next to the crown jewels.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.259
Oh, not "we."

19:11.085 --> 19:13.411
Now I know why The
Library chose you.

19:16.066 --> 19:17.738
Vibration detectors
on the glass.

19:17.754 --> 19:19.481
Got a pressure plate...

19:19.503 --> 19:22.038
can't tell when the weight changes.
It's actually not too difficult.

19:22.062 --> 19:24.710
Please don't let this be
something too unsavory.

19:24.735 --> 19:27.004
No, not at all.

19:27.029 --> 19:29.137
We just need to
steal a wheelchair.

19:45.583 --> 19:48.216
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

19:48.239 --> 19:51.267
Really? All you do is
push people around.

19:55.397 --> 19:56.994
Oh! Oh! I'm so sorry!
[Alarm buzzing]

19:57.018 --> 19:58.815
- That's the third time this week.
- That was an accident.

19:58.837 --> 20:02.303
- Are you okay? - I keep telling you
to slow down. It's not a race. Not a race.

20:02.328 --> 20:03.665
Baird: Sorry.

20:06.944 --> 20:11.043
[Buzzing continues]

20:17.751 --> 20:18.595
Seriously?

20:18.617 --> 20:21.279
You're gonna put your gum on
a stone worth 7 million Euros?

20:22.935 --> 20:24.766
Omni arcanum directio.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.277
Omni arcanum directio.

20:31.638 --> 20:33.806
That's pretty...

20:34.648 --> 20:39.243
[Straining]

20:40.262 --> 20:42.046
[Alarm ringing]

20:44.092 --> 20:46.584
- Baird: Where to?
- Follow the gem.

20:47.020 --> 20:47.919
Aah!

20:53.910 --> 20:55.106
Lost them.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.862
We got about five minutes
before the police show up.

20:57.877 --> 20:59.486
[Straining] Then we
can find it in three.

20:59.511 --> 21:00.818
And then?

21:00.843 --> 21:03.476
Then we have to keep them from
putting Excalibur back in the stone.

21:03.869 --> 21:06.346
Why would they want to put
Excalibur back into the stone?

21:11.400 --> 21:12.978
Dulaque: It would be
like a jump start.

21:13.003 --> 21:14.784
Cassandra: Like jumpstarting a car?

21:14.809 --> 21:19.270
Exactly. Excalibur is one of the few
great items of magic remaining.

21:19.295 --> 21:21.506
It contains
unbelievable power.

21:21.531 --> 21:25.148
Power that was siphoned from
the Ley Lines of magic centuries ago,

21:25.173 --> 21:27.525
and now those ley
lines are dormant.

21:27.550 --> 21:29.902
But if we were to
suddenly shock them

21:29.926 --> 21:32.653
by returning Excalibur's power
back to the Earth,

21:32.678 --> 21:34.267
it would begin
a chain reaction.

21:34.292 --> 21:36.045
The energy would
build on itself.

21:36.061 --> 21:38.586
Magic would spread back
out through the Ley Lines

21:38.608 --> 21:43.792
and magic would return
to the entire world.

21:46.542 --> 21:48.607
This was a river, you know.

21:48.632 --> 21:50.105
The Tyburn.

21:51.028 --> 21:53.693
I remember when it
ran above ground.

21:54.850 --> 21:56.647
Through meadows.

22:01.978 --> 22:04.744
Dulaque: We found the chamber
holding the stone by using sonar.

22:04.764 --> 22:06.971
Decided coming in from the
side was the best bet.

22:06.996 --> 22:08.968
Required drilling
and air recycling,

22:08.983 --> 22:11.329
but still better than
coming in from the top.

22:11.353 --> 22:15.603
There are magical traps at the proper
entrance, plus the human security.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.382
Human security?

22:17.407 --> 22:19.058
You didn't think the
location of the stone

22:19.073 --> 22:20.863
was a complete
secret, did you?

22:20.887 --> 22:23.768
The royal family's been
hiding it for centuries.

22:29.645 --> 22:31.045
Stone: Is that...

22:34.055 --> 22:37.400
- That's Buckingham Palace.
- Ezekiel: Good news.

22:37.423 --> 22:38.590
There's a charity
event on tonight.

22:38.615 --> 22:41.352
- I bet I could forge us some invites.
- We just robbed the tower of London,

22:41.375 --> 22:43.995
and now you want us to break
in to Buckingham Palace?

22:44.013 --> 22:46.390
Well, it is more fraud than
it is breaking and entering.

22:46.398 --> 22:48.158
Listen, can you
make me a duke?

22:48.183 --> 22:49.337
- Sure.
- [Sighs]

22:49.362 --> 22:53.446
What's next? The Vatican?
The Taj Mahal? The White House?

22:55.367 --> 22:56.914
She'll be back.

22:56.938 --> 22:58.046
Maybe.

22:58.326 --> 23:00.531
[Classical music playing]

23:00.556 --> 23:03.532
[Indistinct conversations]

23:08.391 --> 23:11.332
- You okay, cowboy?
- My first suit.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.788
- I'm rocking it.
- Where is Baird?

23:15.130 --> 23:17.696
She's not gonna get in
without an invitation.

23:18.410 --> 23:20.504
- Good evening.
- Welcome, sir.

23:20.522 --> 23:21.671
Good evening.

23:25.130 --> 23:26.635
And these are
your invitations?

23:27.816 --> 23:29.366
Could you wait here?

23:30.226 --> 23:32.448
And please don't
try to leave.

23:34.167 --> 23:35.745
You know
what I'm thinking?

23:36.996 --> 23:38.590
That your forgeries
are crap?

23:38.613 --> 23:42.399
No. I'm thinking I can run faster
than you 'cause you've been stabbed.

23:44.623 --> 23:45.975
Stone: Oh, here we go.

23:46.771 --> 23:47.967
[Clears throat]

23:49.931 --> 23:51.477
Baird: They're with me.

24:02.193 --> 24:04.210
Orders from the director
of counterterrorism.

24:04.235 --> 24:05.534
Stay sharp.

24:06.034 --> 24:08.216
Man: All right, gentlemen.
Welcome.

24:13.677 --> 24:17.477
[Classical music playing,
indistinct conversations]

24:23.800 --> 24:26.731
The royal family must have created
access to get to the stone.

24:26.753 --> 24:30.084
Look for a secret passageway,
something out of the ordinary.

24:33.645 --> 24:36.887
Undercover, Librarian. Can't
hold you up all night.

24:37.579 --> 24:39.501
How about the next
five minutes?

24:46.690 --> 24:48.425
All right, look for
anything out of place.

24:48.450 --> 24:50.054
We got to find the
secret passage.

24:50.079 --> 24:52.376
Well, if we find it, it's
not so secret, then, is it?

24:52.401 --> 24:56.346
Profoundly influenced by
the landscape artist Robert Bevans,

24:56.371 --> 24:58.088
who originated this style.

24:58.113 --> 25:01.488
Notice the subtle use of the color
purple in the upper right hand corner.

25:01.503 --> 25:02.808
Hey, hi. Pardon me.

25:02.833 --> 25:05.664
Did you imply that Turner
was influenced by Bevans

25:05.689 --> 25:08.361
- rather than Robert Wilson?
- I did not imply.

25:08.386 --> 25:11.061
I mean, Wilson was
a bit of an influence.

25:11.523 --> 25:14.273
Surely, you've read Turner's
correspondence with John Ruskin?

25:14.298 --> 25:16.618
The pre-eminent art critic
of the 1800s?

25:16.643 --> 25:21.784
He was part of an unbroken line of
influence From Wilson through Turner--

25:21.809 --> 25:23.612
- Champagne, sir?
- Hey, how are you?

25:23.637 --> 25:25.637
- I'm well, sir.
- Thank you.

25:25.662 --> 25:27.662
Actually, can
I get a beer?

25:30.084 --> 25:32.084
Hello, gorgeous.

25:40.334 --> 25:41.982
This is nice.

25:43.796 --> 25:45.234
Yes, it is.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.127
We can completely
move around the room

25:47.152 --> 25:50.122
and check for secret passages
without seeming suspicious.

25:51.154 --> 25:52.693
Exactly that.

25:53.444 --> 25:55.092
Do you think Stone
and Ezekiel are, uh--

25:55.117 --> 25:57.297
Not doing what they're
supposed to be doing?

25:57.322 --> 25:58.666
Probably not.

25:59.322 --> 26:00.980
We've dropped them into
a completely ridiculous

26:01.005 --> 26:03.349
situation with
absolutely no training.

26:03.374 --> 26:05.054
It's what happened to me.

26:05.079 --> 26:07.079
They don't train
the Librarian?

26:08.033 --> 26:09.892
Well, how'd you do on
your first mission?

26:09.917 --> 26:13.120
[Laughs] I got completely distracted,
nearly died about 9 times.

26:13.145 --> 26:15.145
And would have if it
hadn't been for my--

26:15.771 --> 26:17.224
guardian.

26:19.077 --> 26:22.574
For what it's worth,
I'm glad you didn't die.

26:23.677 --> 26:25.575
I found out there's magic
in the world.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.233
I owe you that.

26:29.484 --> 26:33.765
We should schedule a dance some time when
you're not slowly bleeding to death.

26:34.796 --> 26:36.288
Let's save
the world first.

26:36.798 --> 26:38.798
You ever get used
to saving the world?

26:38.823 --> 26:40.823
[Chuckles]

26:40.848 --> 26:44.102
I don't even bother to put it
on my to-do list anymore.

26:49.196 --> 26:52.036
Mr. Dulaque, we cannot thank
you enough for your donation.

26:52.662 --> 26:56.756
Ambassador, I've always said if
you want to change the world,

26:56.771 --> 26:59.496
you can't wait around for other
people to do it for you.

26:59.862 --> 27:02.281
We're running out of time.

27:02.838 --> 27:04.197
[Grunts]

27:04.213 --> 27:06.260
Get me through that wall.

in here now!

27:46.807 --> 27:49.918
[Indistinct shouting]

27:52.394 --> 27:54.319
- Cut through this.
- Man: Right, ma'am.

27:57.133 --> 27:58.289
Aah!

27:59.594 --> 28:01.587
Right. New plan.

28:02.227 --> 28:04.226
[Indistinct shouting]

28:06.210 --> 28:07.854
What is this?

28:12.281 --> 28:13.750
It's high Enochian.

28:14.005 --> 28:15.971
[Magical tinkling]

28:21.901 --> 28:25.966
It's a mathematical language based
on ancient Greek and Hebrew.

28:29.526 --> 28:31.186
And you can crack it?

28:31.944 --> 28:33.721
Given time.

28:35.963 --> 28:38.070
Take all the time you need.

28:41.367 --> 28:43.367
The crown, ma'am.

28:50.344 --> 28:52.344
[Whirring]

29:08.501 --> 29:10.705
They're running standard
counter-terrorism along the perimeter

29:10.730 --> 29:12.361
and soft threat
assessment on the inside.

29:12.386 --> 29:14.450
Which mean's their
attention's on the vips

29:14.475 --> 29:16.166
and the interior guards
are guarding the doorways

29:16.191 --> 29:18.705
and the corridors, which
begs one question.

29:18.730 --> 29:21.419
Why is that guard
standing at the wall?

29:25.950 --> 29:29.310
That coat of arms belonged to John
Sheffield, Duke of Normandy.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.569
Original architect
of Buckingham House.

29:32.679 --> 29:34.679
- Secret door.
- Secret door.

29:36.687 --> 29:39.498
I think I might be fading
a little faster than I thought.

29:42.515 --> 29:46.585
Certainly you can't argue that
Joseph Turner simply changed styles.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.610
I'm not arguing with you,
I'm telling you.

29:48.635 --> 29:51.291
From the Plates of Lugares to The
Iron, you can see the reflections--

29:51.316 --> 29:53.316
Stone, got to go.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.771
And so, that's pretty
much exactly why--

29:55.796 --> 29:57.101
Really?

29:58.375 --> 29:59.711
You, uh, dropped these.

29:59.736 --> 30:01.104
[Gasps]

30:01.128 --> 30:03.066
- How very--
- And these.

30:27.466 --> 30:29.212
I was really expecting
a better secret door.

30:29.237 --> 30:31.033
I'll write a letter.
Let's go.

30:32.392 --> 30:33.698
You ain't looking so hot.

30:33.723 --> 30:36.145
No matter what happens,
get the crown.

30:36.170 --> 30:39.495
If you drop, we'll leave
you and move on.

30:40.512 --> 30:42.611
Wait... Why would
you go there?

30:42.636 --> 30:44.379
That's a horrible
thing to say.

Librarian.

31:12.029 --> 31:13.653

dungeons, right?

31:13.678 --> 31:16.269
- Find a cell. Stick her in it.
- Yes, ma'am.

31:16.895 --> 31:18.462
You said you were
gonna help people.

31:18.477 --> 31:21.258
We are. We're bringing
magic back to the world...

the whole world,
all at once.

returns, and we control it.

That's a magic wound.

32:27.460 --> 32:29.273
Hello, Dolly!

32:31.156 --> 32:35.367
A 1911 Château d'Yquem. Stole one of
these once. Worth about $100,000.

32:35.390 --> 32:37.572
Not a chance of this
staying in a wine cellar.

32:37.597 --> 32:39.433
I don't care whose
wine cellar it is.

- Shh!

33:24.360 --> 33:26.439
They tunneled in
from the side.

That's much smarter
than what we did.

33:32.808 --> 33:34.199
Lamia: We have
worked long and hard

33:34.221 --> 33:38.202
to achieve what stands
before us today, brothers...

33:42.291 --> 33:46.924
The goal of returning
magic to the world.

33:47.448 --> 33:49.273
It is but moments away.

34:00.042 --> 34:02.550
Okay, we got trained killers. One
of them's got a crown that...

34:02.572 --> 34:05.812
that's allowing her to control
the most deadly weapon on Earth.

No, no, no, no.

this together. So let's do this together.

Okay, so, that's the drill that
they cool with ice-water pipes.

34:57.916 --> 34:59.314
That's the air recycler.

35:00.281 --> 35:02.793
And then the electrical wires
for the generator, and then...

35:02.818 --> 35:04.005
I got you. Metal pipes.

35:04.028 --> 35:06.000
Very good plan.
Distraction, then action.

35:06.013 --> 35:08.387
This is gonna work, but
it's gonna take all of us.

35:08.412 --> 35:09.877
Stone, your knowledge
of mechanics.

35:09.902 --> 35:12.972
You need to reroute that ice-water
coolant into the warm air recycler.

That's gonna give
us our cover.

that generator panel

35:31.891 --> 35:33.982

current, very strong,

fled his gift, one who abuses it?

is nothing,

generous of you.

41:51.999 --> 41:53.945
Ah, well, not really.

41:53.970 --> 41:56.517
All the miles a Librarian
racks up every year,

41:56.542 --> 41:59.792
you can trade those in for a seat on
a flight to the secret moon colony.

Hmm.

well, uh...

For you, yup.

some rather generous--

- Not too generous.
- Stipends into your accounts

42:16.924 --> 42:18.973

I don't think it's fair or safe
to involve you in this life any longer.

A life that would have been ours had
luck broken just a little differently.

- Yes.

You've also all signed
non-disclosure forms

43:04.459 --> 43:06.067
so as not to tell
anyone of the events

43:06.092 --> 43:08.003
which occurred, the existence
of The Library,

43:08.028 --> 43:10.785

and secret conspiracies

43:10.810 --> 43:13.684
and... well, anything.

43:13.919 --> 43:14.974
Or else?

43:14.999 --> 43:18.824
Please, tell people about
the magic library and Excalibur

43:18.849 --> 43:20.647
and how you broke into
Buckingham Palace

43:20.671 --> 43:22.194
because King Arthur
is really Roman.

43:22.219 --> 43:25.141
I'll come visit you, make sure
the straight-jacket's not too tight.

43:27.960 --> 43:29.374
Flynn: What about
temporal resonance?

43:29.389 --> 43:30.433
We could get
a crystal skull,

43:30.450 --> 43:33.859
- and I know where to... - Sir, sir,
I... I... I've tried everything.

43:34.430 --> 43:37.474
Now, the... the card catalog is
still anchored to this reality.

43:37.499 --> 43:40.168
It can still access the
records of The Library...

43:40.176 --> 43:41.726
books, manuscripts.

43:41.741 --> 43:44.990
But The Library itself
and all of its artifacts

43:45.015 --> 43:47.192
are cut loose
from this world.

43:47.217 --> 43:49.430
The... The Library
is adrift in...

43:49.853 --> 43:53.112
time and space.
The Library, sir, is lost.

44:18.697 --> 44:19.528
Hello, Flynn.

44:19.553 --> 44:21.205
[Laughs]

44:23.134 --> 44:24.349
Judson.

44:25.376 --> 44:26.790
Is The Library...

44:26.815 --> 44:28.182
Intact?

44:28.661 --> 44:30.289
Certainly.

44:30.314 --> 44:32.016
And Charlene?

44:32.041 --> 44:33.807
She's with The Library.

44:33.825 --> 44:35.825
She's tougher than
she looks, you know.

44:35.848 --> 44:38.406
- And you?
- I'm, uh...

44:39.958 --> 44:42.533
My... my time is done.

44:43.832 --> 44:46.025
- You're ready to move on.
- No.

44:46.768 --> 44:48.328
You're ready.

44:54.532 --> 44:56.961
You know, Judson,
I never, um...

44:59.530 --> 45:01.071
I never had a father.

45:01.761 --> 45:04.118
And I never had a son.

45:05.995 --> 45:07.432
Well...

45:08.059 --> 45:09.786
Now we're both liars.

45:13.879 --> 45:15.893
I'm gonna find
The Library.

45:17.154 --> 45:20.166
I'm the Librarian.
Nothing's impossible.

45:20.182 --> 45:22.680
The Serpent
Brotherhood failed,

45:23.440 --> 45:28.026
but they released an enormous
amount of magic into the world.

45:28.051 --> 45:29.926
Things are going to
get a little...

45:29.951 --> 45:31.631
little mad out there.

45:32.104 --> 45:34.246
You're in charge now.

45:34.271 --> 45:38.422
And-And-And you're
not going to have time

45:38.447 --> 45:40.291
to-to search for The Library.

45:41.572 --> 45:42.840
No.

45:43.343 --> 45:45.088
Not if I try to
do it alone.

45:45.113 --> 45:48.311
Flynn... I'll...
I'll always be...

45:50.344 --> 45:51.786
Baird: Flynn?

45:57.808 --> 45:59.257
I'm the Librarian.

46:02.221 --> 46:03.970
I'm in charge.

46:03.995 --> 46:05.028
Oh.

46:05.764 --> 46:06.844
Okay.

46:08.706 --> 46:11.737
So it's time I started
making up some new rules.

46:27.520 --> 46:29.157
New plan.

46:32.587 --> 46:35.837
Although I suspect
it's the old plan.

46:35.862 --> 46:38.143
I'm just figuring it out.

46:38.168 --> 46:41.049
- Open your envelopes.
- Our airline tickets?

46:41.781 --> 46:44.461
[Majestic music plays]

46:44.486 --> 46:45.757
[Zapping]

46:45.973 --> 46:47.590
- Go ahead.
- I left mine back at--

46:47.615 --> 46:49.113
Look again.

47:03.167 --> 47:04.756
Just as I suspected.

47:05.594 --> 47:07.125
We have a lot
of work to do.

47:09.422 --> 47:13.742
I think that this will be a
perfect base of operations!

47:13.765 --> 47:16.142
We'll have access to the archives,
if not the artifacts.

47:16.167 --> 47:18.262
And Jenkins here will
teach you how to research

47:18.277 --> 47:20.163
and supervise your
training as Librarians.

47:20.188 --> 47:22.724
What are you talking about?
We do not train Librarians.

47:22.740 --> 47:25.224
Yes, and isn't
that stupid?

47:25.242 --> 47:28.633
We take a highly intelligent, but
totally unsuspecting, individual,

47:28.656 --> 47:31.192
drop them in a world of magic,
and then expect them not to die

47:31.217 --> 47:32.671
before they learn
where the toilet is.

47:32.686 --> 47:35.383
- That is how it's always been done.
- Now that I'm Librarian,

47:35.398 --> 47:37.860
we're not doing it
that way anymore.

47:37.885 --> 47:39.221
Meet...

47:39.246 --> 47:40.944
The Librarianettes.

47:40.952 --> 47:43.819
No. Meet the Librarians
in training,

47:43.838 --> 47:45.904
the L.I.T.s, my
little lits.

47:46.351 --> 47:48.278
- Yes.
- But... but they're not qualified.

47:48.303 --> 47:49.681
Then we'll qualify them.

47:49.706 --> 47:51.136
I'll still handle
the big stuff.

47:51.161 --> 47:54.481
They'll handle all the, you know,
slightly less-apocalyptic stuff.

47:54.504 --> 47:56.054
And this will free me up

47:57.275 --> 47:59.239
to find The Library
and bring it back.

47:59.264 --> 48:00.512
That is impossible.

48:00.519 --> 48:03.681
Oh, impossible! Pipsy-posh!
Pipsy-posh, Jenkins!

48:03.706 --> 48:07.315
People keep saying that as if we don't eat
the impossible for breakfast every day.

48:11.952 --> 48:14.522
I'm offering you a
life of mystery...

48:16.874 --> 48:18.347
And misery...

48:19.253 --> 48:20.817
of loneliness...

48:21.391 --> 48:23.082
and adventure.

48:29.048 --> 48:31.979
More than that, I'm offering you
an opportunity to make a difference...

48:33.284 --> 48:35.213
And save the world
every week.

48:36.517 --> 48:38.014
Twice before Friday.

48:39.694 --> 48:41.374
Are you in?

48:44.363 --> 48:45.527
Even her?

48:45.545 --> 48:48.995
- Yeah. - She sacrificed her
own life to save Flynn's.

48:49.632 --> 48:51.320
I trust her.

48:55.655 --> 48:57.158
I'll give it a shot.

48:57.929 --> 48:59.860
If we're helping
people, sure.

49:00.253 --> 49:03.250
It will provide an opportunity
to steal new things.

49:03.275 --> 49:04.727
I'm in.

49:19.279 --> 49:21.823
Hey, it's your
library now.

49:23.038 --> 49:25.207
At least this
little part of it.

49:26.315 --> 49:29.258
And don't worry... I'll be back
to check on you in a few weeks.

49:32.228 --> 49:33.876
Try not to die.

49:40.096 --> 49:41.774
Oh, joy.

49:43.784 --> 49:45.671
We'll need to find
them a guardian.

49:45.696 --> 49:47.890
Stone's the only one who can
handle himself in a bar fight,

49:47.905 --> 49:51.327
and I don't think you'll find too
many magical artifacts in dive bars.

49:51.352 --> 49:53.659
I've already found
their guardian.

49:54.997 --> 49:56.395
Flynn, no.

49:56.420 --> 49:58.114
With Judson gone,
who can you trust?

49:58.139 --> 49:59.711
Well, that's just it.

50:01.630 --> 50:04.316
With Judson gone and
The Library gone,

50:05.554 --> 50:08.054
if anything were
to happen to me,

50:08.079 --> 50:09.706
they're the future.

50:11.343 --> 50:14.398
I haven't met anybody that I
trust in the last five years.

50:15.135 --> 50:16.457
I trust you...

50:17.114 --> 50:18.638
to protect them.

50:19.693 --> 50:21.615
But I thought you
needed a guardian.

50:22.188 --> 50:23.997
The Library chose you
to be a guardian.

50:24.019 --> 50:26.237
I think The Library
chose you to be...

50:27.754 --> 50:29.119
Their guardian.

50:29.926 --> 50:32.158
And Lord knows they're
gonna need protecting.

50:33.075 --> 50:34.680
Way more than I need...

50:36.233 --> 50:38.344
More than I want...

50:39.326 --> 50:42.280
to be traveling the
world with you.

50:46.610 --> 50:48.205
Librarian and guardian.

50:48.947 --> 50:51.313
The job's more important
than what we want.

50:52.081 --> 50:53.592
Oh, don't say that.

50:54.330 --> 50:55.736
That's the old way.

50:55.760 --> 50:59.219
But, for now, we have
to work separately.

51:10.591 --> 51:12.130
Come back alive,
Librarian.

51:12.155 --> 51:14.784
I... come back... Yeah.

51:14.806 --> 51:17.605
I... will come back and I'll talk...
um...

51:17.628 --> 51:18.441
[Shudders]

51:18.466 --> 51:20.294
Sorry. I'm just...
I'll call you.

51:20.310 --> 51:23.519
No, I'll text you. Well, you text me,
and we'll text each other. It'll be...

51:24.348 --> 51:27.341
one of those thi...
Okay, so, yeah. Okay.

51:32.124 --> 51:35.771
Jenkins: Now, um, I know that Flynn
is technically the Librarian

51:35.787 --> 51:40.062
- and that I technically work
for The Library... - [Sighs]

51:40.073 --> 51:43.431
vis-à-vis, et cetera, et
cetera, the Librarian.

51:43.456 --> 51:46.592
- But I don't...
- Really have a choice.

51:47.223 --> 51:49.353
These three will be using
this as a base of operations,

51:49.369 --> 51:51.183
and I'll be supervising
their security.

51:51.208 --> 51:52.466
So...

51:53.052 --> 51:56.659
make yourself useful
or make yourself gone.

51:59.737 --> 52:01.856
- You're bluffing.
- Ooh.

52:02.576 --> 52:06.599
- She doesn't bluff.
- Not so much threats as promises.

52:06.624 --> 52:09.281
Yeah, she can and will
kick your ass.

52:15.584 --> 52:17.694
I suppose there's always
the clippings book.

52:17.719 --> 52:19.016
What's a clippings book?

52:19.041 --> 52:21.784
Oh, child of the
annoying digital age,

52:21.809 --> 52:25.558
it is how we used to gather
information about news stories.

52:26.466 --> 52:29.677
Each page has clippings
from different sources,

52:29.692 --> 52:31.674
detailing a
bizarre mystery.

52:31.914 --> 52:34.851
Well, we really don't need a book
full of old newspaper articles.

52:34.875 --> 52:36.945
Oh, silly
Midwestern person,

52:36.969 --> 52:40.393
this clippings book is the
Library's clippings book.

52:40.418 --> 52:42.965
Every night, there
is a new page,

52:42.990 --> 52:47.566
new information about a new
mystery happening that very day.

52:47.591 --> 52:49.233
Come. Let's begin.

52:51.520 --> 52:53.240
Oh-ho!

52:53.254 --> 52:55.157
Oh.This is fascinating.

[Dramatic music plays]

53:02.048 --> 53:04.993
We will never
solve this one.
