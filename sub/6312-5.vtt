WEBVTT

00:01.730 --> 00:02.719
Previously on Elementary...
Oscar?

00:02.770 --> 00:04.465
Long time, no speak, huh?

00:04.500 --> 00:06.434
We can talk about Alfredo.
What?

00:06.470 --> 00:07.698
Well, I'm the one who took him.

00:07.740 --> 00:09.799
You help me
find my sister, maybe

00:09.840 --> 00:11.398
you'll see Alfredo alive again.

00:13.410 --> 00:14.729
Alfredo!

00:16.480 --> 00:17.606
Hey, I said no phones.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.003
(grunting)

00:27.290 --> 00:29.588
(doorbell buzzes)

00:34.830 --> 00:35.751
Alfredo!

00:35.800 --> 00:37.392
It's so great to see you.

00:37.430 --> 00:38.567
(laughs)

00:38.600 --> 00:40.295
Please, come in.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.331
Well, if I'd have known
hugs were on the table,

00:42.370 --> 00:43.769
I'd have left Chicago
alotsoonen

00:43.810 --> 00:45.562
(Alfredo laughs)

00:45.610 --> 00:47.498
Please, sit down.

00:47.540 --> 00:50.441
So, you were gone so long,
I thought maybe you were moving.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.573
Sherlock said you
got back last week?

00:52.620 --> 00:55.271
I can only take my sister's
cooking for so long.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.787
Well, I-I just
got through with a meeting.

00:56.820 --> 00:59.687
I thought I'd stop by,
say hi to Sherlock.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.085
Actually, Sherlock
went to a meeting.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.326
I thought you two
might be together.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.578
Well, you're right
that we usually

01:04.630 --> 01:07.394
meet up at 11:00,
but today he was a no-show.

01:07.430 --> 01:09.819
Oh. Well, something
must have come up.

01:09.870 --> 01:13.738
Well, the thing is, he hasn't
been to St. Luke's all week.

01:13.770 --> 01:16.830
I thought after his relapse,
he would be doubling down.

01:16.870 --> 01:19.703
Oh, he has been.
Or at least he said he was.

01:19.740 --> 01:22.345
I mean, it's hard to imagine
he might be avoiding meetings.

01:22.380 --> 01:25.702
Maybe it's not the meetings
he's avoiding.

01:25.750 --> 01:26.819
All the stuff

01:26.850 --> 01:28.579
that's happened-- Oscar Rankin,

01:28.620 --> 01:30.110
me ge’fting tied to a chair--

01:30.150 --> 01:31.845
I only told Sherlock
a million times

01:31.890 --> 01:33.187
I don't blame him.

01:33.220 --> 01:35.450
No, he gets it.
He understands.

01:35.490 --> 01:38.379
And yet, I haven't seen him
since I got back.

01:41.330 --> 01:43.423
Well, whatever's going on,
it's cool.

01:43.470 --> 01:46.792
I just want to know he's okay.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.831
(phone rings)

01:48.870 --> 01:50.861
This is Eddie.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.878
I'm either not here
or screening my calls.

01:52.910 --> 01:54.207
Leave a message.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.639
(beep)

01:55.680 --> 01:57.841
WOMAN: Hey, Eddie,
it's Sharon next door.

01:57.880 --> 02:00.178
I think I smell gas
coming from your place.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.812
I'm worried you have a leak.

02:01.850 --> 02:04.546
I'll try your cell phone, too,
and if I can't get you,

02:04.590 --> 02:07.286
I'll call the gas company just
to make sure everything's okay.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.878
Thanks.
(hangs up)

02:11.230 --> 02:13.653
(ringing)

02:34.220 --> 02:36.211
*

03:01.010 --> 03:04.673
*

03:35.580 --> 03:36.808
BELL: Victim's name
was Eddie Ross.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.704
We had to ID. him
with dental records.

03:38.750 --> 03:40.615
Stabbed in the chest
and incinerated.

03:40.650 --> 03:42.515
Did the killer also
throw him off a roof?

03:42.550 --> 03:44.438
He was dead
before the fire started.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.879
Figure there was a struggle,
the perp torched the place

03:46.920 --> 03:49.457
to cover up any evidence
he left behind.

03:49.490 --> 03:50.855
The neighbor-- you said

03:50.890 --> 03:52.858
you interviewed her yourself.
Yeah.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.461
And she smelled a gas leak,
as in natural gas?

03:56.500 --> 03:59.264
Well, her unit and Ross's
both have gas stoves.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.858
She thought maybe
the pilot went out,

04:00.900 --> 04:02.868
only it didn't.
We checked.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.606
So she must have smelled
the gasoline, got mixed up.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.574
But they don't smell the same.

04:07.610 --> 04:09.578
No, but not everyone
has your nose.

04:09.610 --> 04:11.441
The fire destroyed any prints
on the murder weapon,

04:11.480 --> 04:13.038
but you can still see the brand

04:13.080 --> 04:16.641
etched on the blade.
It's an archaeologist's trowel.

04:16.690 --> 04:17.645
Don't know yet
whether it belonged

04:17.690 --> 04:18.384
to the victim or the killer,

04:18.420 --> 04:19.887
but we're _
canvassmg suppliers,

04:19.920 --> 04:21.785
trying to identify
the person who bought it.

04:21.820 --> 04:24.050
Pretty sure
it wasn't the victim's.

04:24.090 --> 04:25.057
Most of the wear

04:25.090 --> 04:26.523
is on the right edge

04:26.560 --> 04:27.527
of the blade,
which means it was used

04:27.560 --> 04:28.959
by a left-handed person.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.888
But the musculature of
the Victim's right arm

04:30.930 --> 04:33.637
is more developed than his left.

04:33.670 --> 04:35.297
Which means he was
probably a righty.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.501
BELL: So the owner of
the murder weapon is

04:37.540 --> 04:39.428
a left-handed archaeologist.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.038
How many of those can there be
in New York City?

04:45.050 --> 04:46.938
WOMAN:
I'm sorry, I just...

04:46.980 --> 04:50.438
I can't believe
Eddie's dead.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.458
According to his
Facebook page you two

04:52.490 --> 04:54.310
were a couple,
right up until last summer?

04:55.790 --> 04:57.326
You don't think that I...

04:57.360 --> 04:59.692
Honestly, it's too soon
for us to think anything.

04:59.730 --> 05:01.652
We're just
getting the lay of the land.

05:01.700 --> 05:05.522
We were together
almost two years.

05:05.570 --> 05:07.663
How did you meet?
Grad school.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.601
Um, we both
studied archaeology.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.404
I was lucky,
I... I got a great job.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.998
But Eddie, he was...

05:15.040 --> 05:17.543
he was still struggling.

05:17.580 --> 05:20.469
And it just came
between us.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.715
We stayed friends.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.412
I still cared about him.

05:25.450 --> 05:29.420
So can you account for
your whereabouts last night?

05:29.460 --> 05:32.952
Uh, I was giving a seminar

05:33.000 --> 05:34.956
on Iranian antiquities
down at Penn.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.558
I had breakfast
with Dr. Charvat,

05:36.600 --> 05:37.726
the department head,

05:37.770 --> 05:39.692
before I came
home this morning.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.731
All right, we'll need
his number before we go.

05:41.770 --> 05:43.601
HOLMES: Ms. Burstyn,
archaeologists

05:43.640 --> 05:46.609
are very protective of their
tools, so can you tell us

05:46.640 --> 05:49.609
how yours came to be
in your ex's possession?

05:49.650 --> 05:51.572
Uh...

05:51.610 --> 05:53.077
about a week and a half ago,

05:53.120 --> 05:55.645
Eddie came to me and asked
to borrow some of our eqUIpment.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.648
I-I gave him whatever he wanted.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.681
Did he say what
he was using it for?

05:59.720 --> 06:02.086
A dig.

06:02.120 --> 06:05.157
He wouldn't tell me what
he was trying to excavate,

06:05.190 --> 06:07.954
but he was excited.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.663
He said he was
onto something big.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.759
Big as in
"of great historical import"

06:13.800 --> 06:15.165
or "worth a lot of money"?

06:15.200 --> 06:17.805
I'm-I'm asking because,
in either case,

06:17.840 --> 06:19.774
he may have had
some competition.

06:19.810 --> 06:22.176
Um, I'm-I'm sorry, he...

06:22.210 --> 06:24.508
he didn't say.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.518
What kind of equipment
did you loan him?

06:26.550 --> 06:28.415
Um, stakes and buckets,

06:28.450 --> 06:30.680
a-a pickaxe, a shovel...

06:30.720 --> 06:32.688
my truck.
Your truck?

06:32.720 --> 06:34.711
He didn't have a car.
He needed something

06:34.760 --> 06:36.728
to carry all the gear,
plus whatever...

06:36.760 --> 06:39.081
whatever it was
he was digging for.

06:39.130 --> 06:40.927
Any idea where the truck is now?

06:40.960 --> 06:44.623
I think he just parked it
on the street near his place.

06:50.510 --> 06:53.104
So Eddie Ross's background
check was a bust.

06:53.140 --> 06:54.698
No criminal record,
no enemies,

06:54.740 --> 06:56.708
as far as his friends
knew, and no

06:56.750 --> 06:59.571
unusual debts. And his ex-
girlfriend's alibi checked out.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.178
She was in Philadelphia
all last night.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.438
Well, I hope she's not
in a hurry to reclaim her truck.

07:03.490 --> 07:04.912
It's gonna need a little while
to air out.

07:04.950 --> 07:07.453
This was what was in her truck?

07:07.490 --> 07:09.014
First two
buckets of 12.

07:09.060 --> 07:11.528
_ The_rest
are In the evrdence room.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.120
Well, I don't get it.
Eddie's big find was garbage?

07:14.160 --> 07:16.924
You're familiar
with garbology?

07:16.970 --> 07:18.926
It's the study of rubbish.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.835
Archaeologists employ it
to learn more

07:20.870 --> 07:22.508
about different cultures.
The idea being that

07:22.540 --> 07:24.531
we are what we throw away,

07:24.570 --> 07:27.733
as were the ancient Romans
or the first American settlers.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.668
So Eddie's dig site
was at a dump.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.974
More likely a landfill.
Most of the stuff here

07:32.010 --> 07:35.776
is from the late '705,
early '805.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.640
From our conversation
With his ex,

07:37.690 --> 07:39.658
I doubt he was studying culture.

07:39.690 --> 07:41.214
More likely looking
for something.
He was probably studying

07:41.260 --> 07:44.855
this re_fuse in_order
to zero In on hIS prize.

07:44.890 --> 07:48.519
Well, if it was a prize,
why would someone throw it away?

07:48.560 --> 07:50.118
_ One man's trash
IS another man's treasure.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.798
Put the word "vintage" in front
of glass bottles, cameras,

07:52.840 --> 07:55.764
trading cards-- you can
turn a tidy profit.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.132
WATSON: Vintage
rainbow suspenders.

07:58.170 --> 07:59.979
If there's money in stuff
like this, I need to get to

08:00.010 --> 08:01.671
my parents' basement fast.

08:01.710 --> 08:04.008
Hopefully, the other buckets
will yield more insight.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.789
Oh, hey, Alfredo came by
the brownstone yesterday.

08:10.820 --> 08:12.617
Oh?

08:12.660 --> 08:15.788
Yeah. He said you hadn't
been to St. Luke's all week.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.720
Uh, he's correct;
I have not.

08:17.760 --> 08:21.093
Just wanted to_ make sure
you were domg okay.

08:21.130 --> 08:24.122
What, you're worried I haven't
been to any meetings?

08:24.170 --> 08:26.126
Well, you can both rest easy.

08:26.170 --> 08:27.831
I've just been
going to different ones.

08:27.870 --> 08:29.132
Some in Flatbush,

08:29.170 --> 08:31.866
some in the, uh,
Kingston Avenue Jewish Center.

08:31.910 --> 08:33.537
Okay.

08:33.580 --> 08:36.003
Even though St. Luke's
is right up the street?

08:36.040 --> 08:37.905
Si...

08:37.950 --> 08:39.918
Since my relapse,

08:39.950 --> 08:41.918
I've had to start
my program anew.

08:41.950 --> 08:43.918
My "days sober" count
has reverted to one,

08:43.950 --> 08:46.145
so I thought I would have
a correspondingly fresh approach

08:46.190 --> 08:49.114
in regards to my meetings...
all right?

08:49.160 --> 08:51.287
You know how conducive
I find a change of setting

08:51.330 --> 08:53.855
to my work as a detective.
I thought the same might apply

08:53.900 --> 08:56.619
to my work as an addict.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.935
Okay, well, Alfredo just thought
that you might be avoiding him

08:59.970 --> 09:01.631
because you feel guilty
about everything

09:01.670 --> 09:03.206
that went down with Oscar.

09:03.240 --> 09:06.778
What happened on that day is
no reason to avoid my friend.

09:06.810 --> 09:08.698
Okay, well, then you should
check in with him,

09:08.740 --> 09:10.708
let him know you're doing okay.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.911
WATSON:
"Reagan for President."

09:15.680 --> 09:17.648
If you're thinking
about sending money,

09:17.690 --> 09:20.215
let me save you the trouble.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.285
What interests me are not
the contents of this mail

09:22.320 --> 09:24.788
but the fact
that it is mail.

09:24.830 --> 09:28.891
This arrived at this address
postmarked October 7, 1980.

09:28.930 --> 09:30.295
It was then discarded

09:30.330 --> 09:33.663
and then picked up again
and transported to a landfill.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.601
The same landfill
that Eddie was digging in.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.904
We can call the department
of sanitation,

09:38.940 --> 09:41.135
find out where the garbage
from this address

09:41.180 --> 09:43.239
was taken to in 1980.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.975
Find out where Mr. Ross
was digging,

09:45.010 --> 09:48.946
we might find out what
he was digging for.

09:48.980 --> 09:50.117
Okay, so this neighborhood
is sitting

09:50.150 --> 09:52.141
on top of an old landfill.

09:52.190 --> 09:54.112
It was shut down in 1982

09:54.160 --> 09:56.219
and repurposed
for new construction.

09:56.260 --> 09:58.251
Now, we know that
the garbage our vic dug up

09:58.290 --> 10:00.394
came from somewhere
right around this block.

10:00.430 --> 10:02.864
What we're looking for is the
exact spot he was working,

10:02.900 --> 10:04.765
along with any witnesses
who might have seen him.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.062
I miss anything?

10:06.100 --> 10:07.636
Uh, I would add that,

10:07.670 --> 10:09.092
given the equipment
Mr. Ross borrowed,

10:09.140 --> 10:11.005
he was not digging through
asphalt or concrete,

10:11.040 --> 10:13.008
so that could further
narrow our search

10:13.040 --> 10:15.099
to areas of_
accessrble so”.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.108
All right, that's it.
Fan out.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.243
Holler if you
find anything.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.009
Yeah, sure.

10:21.050 --> 10:23.189
Guy works for the city, right?

10:23.220 --> 10:24.346
Is that what he told you?

10:24.390 --> 10:25.948
Told me? Guy had I.D.

10:25.990 --> 10:27.412
The glovw vest.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.984
He's been digging up
the backyard for a week.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.783
Said something
about the power lines,

10:30.830 --> 10:33.253
and it's a mess back there.
I been wanting to ask him

10:33.300 --> 10:35.188
how much longer
he's gonna be, butI haven't

10:35.230 --> 10:36.891
seen the guy for a few days.

10:36.930 --> 10:38.989
Would you mind
showing me the spot?

10:42.970 --> 10:44.938
What are you doing?

10:44.970 --> 10:46.972
These were chained
to a lamppost down the street.

10:47.010 --> 10:49.877
And you figured
you'd steal them?

10:49.910 --> 10:51.969
I'm re-stealing them.
I peruse the crime blotter

10:52.010 --> 10:54.911
when I'm bored, and these were
stolen in Chelsea last month.

10:54.950 --> 10:55.871
And you're just gonna walk
around with 'em

10:55.920 --> 10:57.114
for the rest of the day?

10:57.150 --> 10:58.947
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
This one's for you.

10:58.990 --> 11:00.958
(phone rings)

11:03.030 --> 11:04.349
Watson?

11:04.390 --> 11:06.051
I'm behind the townhouses

11:06.090 --> 11:08.024
down the block.
You guys should get over here.

11:08.060 --> 11:09.220
You found the dig site?

11:09.260 --> 11:10.727
Not just that.

11:10.770 --> 11:12.829
There's someone digging in it
right now.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.044
Look, for the last time, I di...
I didn't do anything wrong.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.310
You were digging a hole on
someone else's property.

11:28.350 --> 11:30.147
So... there's that.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.839
I didn't know Eddie
didn't have permission.

11:31.890 --> 11:33.881
And I didn't know he was dead
until they told me.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.026
I never even met the guy.
I mean, not exactly.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.049
Not exactly?

11:38.090 --> 11:39.853
We posted on the same

11:39.900 --> 11:41.424
online discussion board,
thatsit

11:41.460 --> 11:43.325
Can you tell us where you
were between the hours

11:43.370 --> 11:45.827
of 12:00 midnight
and 2:00 am?

11:45.870 --> 11:47.360
Is that when he...?

11:48.840 --> 11:50.967
H was at a video game
tournament, at an arcade,

11:51.010 --> 11:53.069
out in Bayville.
I was there all night,

11:53.110 --> 11:55.135
I didn't leave
until around 6:00.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.341
I was_there with _friends.
I can give you their names.

11:57.380 --> 11:59.348
One of them even
tweeted some pictures.

11:59.380 --> 12:02.042
We'll _look into that.
In the meantime, maybe you could

12:02.080 --> 12:04.389
tell us what you were doing
in that hole.

12:04.420 --> 12:07.480
I wanted to see if Eddie
found the games.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.748
HOLMES: What games?

12:08.790 --> 12:10.485
The... games.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.384
I thought you guys
already knew.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.451
We don't know

12:15.500 --> 12:17.388
what Eddie was looking for,
so tell us.

12:17.430 --> 12:20.160
Nottingham Knights.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.738
He was looking
for Nottingham Knights.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.948
I remember this.
It was made by a company

12:29.980 --> 12:31.948
called EmeryVision.
My brother and I

12:31.980 --> 12:34.016
had one of their consoles
when we were kids.

12:34.050 --> 12:36.075
Everyone did.
Without EmeryVision,

12:36.120 --> 12:40.409
you wouldn't have PlayStation
or an Xbox or a Wii.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.314
Then how would humanity
idle away its time--

12:42.360 --> 12:44.021
solving world hunger,
curing cancer...

12:45.130 --> 12:46.324
"Nottingham Knights:

12:46.360 --> 12:49.022
The worst game ever."

12:49.060 --> 12:51.290
Allegedly.

12:51.330 --> 12:52.797
What do mean, allegedly?

12:52.840 --> 12:54.535
Nottingham Knights
was supposed to be

12:54.570 --> 12:56.538
EmeryVision's big
Christmas release in 1980.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.037
There was a huge ad push.

12:58.070 --> 13:00.470
But the_reviews
on advance copies were so bad,

13:00.510 --> 13:02.171
stores started
canceling their orders.

13:02.210 --> 13:03.575
Yeah, says here
EmeryVision

13:03.610 --> 13:05.874
was worried it would
take down the whole company,

13:05.910 --> 13:08.378
so they cut their losses,
dropped the release

13:08.420 --> 13:10.479
and hauled every last copy
to a landfill.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.011
So this is what Eddie Ross
was digging for?

13:13.060 --> 13:15.483
Bunch of video games that were
so bad they were buried?

13:15.520 --> 13:17.181
Why?

13:17.230 --> 13:18.288
HOLMES: A company opts
not to release

13:18.330 --> 13:20.127
a bad product, that's one thing.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.128
They decide this product
is so colossally bad

13:22.160 --> 13:23.866
it has to bury
the whole inventory,

13:23.900 --> 13:25.367
that's the stuff of legend.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.539
Yeah, yeah,
it became this thing

13:27.570 --> 13:29.060
that gamers talked about

13:29.100 --> 13:30.567
for decades.
It was like

13:30.610 --> 13:33.204
the Holy Grail.
If the Holy Grail

13:33.240 --> 13:35.504
were a plodding, pixelated
failure banished to a dump.

13:35.540 --> 13:38.941
Every few years, somebody
would try to find the games.

13:38.980 --> 13:41.574
They'd get their hands
on company records

13:41.620 --> 13:43.542
or, uh, track down the sites

13:43.590 --> 13:46.479
where EmeryVision dumped
their garbage.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.114
This year, it was Eddie.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.424
He was posting updates
on the board.

13:51.460 --> 13:52.927
A few days ago,
he said he was close,

13:52.960 --> 13:55.121
and then... radio silence.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.889
I went over there today,
because I had to see

13:56.930 --> 13:58.227
if he'd actually done it.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.362
And?

14:00.600 --> 14:01.589
Look, you're the only one here

14:01.640 --> 14:02.937
who's been in the hole.

14:02.970 --> 14:04.301
Had he found the games?

14:04.340 --> 14:06.308
I couldn't tell.
There was some stuff

14:06.340 --> 14:08.979
from EmeryVision in there,
from the right years--

14:09.010 --> 14:12.309
a piece of an old console,
a few recalled joysticks--

14:12.350 --> 14:14.443
but I didn't see any sign
of any of the cartridges.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.040
So maybe the killer took
the games.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.615
He was an obsessed gamer,
just like you.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.914
Yeah. Or he was just in it
for the money.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.258
Money? What money?

14:24.290 --> 14:26.019
For the games.

14:26.060 --> 14:27.618
Those advance copies,

14:27.660 --> 14:28.991
the ones
in the original packaging,

14:29.030 --> 14:30.224
go for ten grand apiece.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.362
If the... legend

14:31.400 --> 14:32.367
is true,
there would've been

14:32.400 --> 14:34.197
thousands in that landfill.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.538
Altogether, you're talking
about a few million bucks.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.436
Did I not mention that?

14:42.480 --> 14:44.675
(Holmes clears throat)

14:44.710 --> 14:47.508
'69 'Cuda.

14:47.550 --> 14:52.544
Owner wants 40 grand for it,
if you're interested.

14:52.590 --> 14:55.184
It would seem my week has
a theme of middle-aged men

14:55.220 --> 14:58.223
clinging to pubescent glory
via collectibles.

15:00.060 --> 15:02.221
Nice to see you, Alfredo.

15:02.260 --> 15:04.626
Likewise.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.565
I take it
Joan told you I stopped by.

15:10.610 --> 15:14.432
I've been difficult
to reach lately.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.903
Thought I'd explain.

15:17.980 --> 15:20.346
Just about
to get some breakfast.

15:20.380 --> 15:21.642
Want to join?

15:28.190 --> 15:29.589
That's not breakfast.

15:29.620 --> 15:32.623
Maybe not where you're from.

15:32.660 --> 15:34.457
Try one.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.367
I did. Two years,
three months, 27 days ago,

15:37.400 --> 15:39.493
when you first brought
a box to a meeting.

15:41.640 --> 15:45.508
You do realize pink coconuts
do not occur in nature.

15:45.540 --> 15:49.533
Everyone else loves
these donuts.

15:49.580 --> 15:52.048
Addicts and alcoholics
often crave sugar.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.219
You put frosted rocks
in a gingham box,

15:54.250 --> 15:55.547
they'd eat those, too.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.185
That's why
you switched meetings?

15:58.220 --> 16:00.188
Get better snacks?

16:01.220 --> 16:03.188
As you know,

16:03.230 --> 16:08.327
I've found the program immensely
helpful over the last few years,

16:08.360 --> 16:11.591
and my appreciation for that
support's never wavered.

16:12.730 --> 16:16.461
But, since my relapse,
I find the routine

16:16.500 --> 16:19.765
which used to bring me comfort--
the familiar faces, rooms--

16:24.810 --> 16:27.745
And I'm one
of those familiar faces.

16:27.780 --> 16:31.614
In... context, yeah.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.020
Well, it's like
I always told you--

16:37.060 --> 16:40.120
you gotta be selfish, do what's
right for you. Whatever it takes

16:40.160 --> 16:41.593
to stay sober. Just...

16:41.630 --> 16:44.690
It's the only thing
that matters.

16:44.730 --> 16:48.188
Obviously, my new regimen
should not affect our friendship

16:48.240 --> 16:50.606
outside of the meetings.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.768
Of course.

16:55.810 --> 16:59.701
So,you".ﬁnd
a new sponsor yet?

16:59.750 --> 17:04.380
His predecessor
has proven difficult to replace.

17:04.420 --> 17:05.546
Hm.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.683
Well, don't take too long.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.779
Fresh faces are good, but...

17:09.820 --> 17:11.321
you don't want to try
to go it alone.

17:11.360 --> 17:13.499
That's the one way
the program doesn't work.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.268
WATSON: Sherlock?
HOLMES: Study.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.790
(door shuts,
footsteps approaching)

17:21.240 --> 17:23.629
Marcus and I just met with
the owner of the building

17:23.670 --> 17:24.659
where Eddie was digging.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.598
He had no idea
Eddie was back there

17:26.640 --> 17:28.608
until the super told him
about it this morning.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.699
All he wanted to know was
who was gonna pay

17:30.750 --> 17:32.547
to fix his yard up.

17:32.580 --> 17:35.447
I've been perusing the
message boards that Eddie,

17:35.480 --> 17:37.687
Tyler, and their ilk used
to share their appreciation

17:37.720 --> 17:39.449
of Nottingham Knights.

17:39.490 --> 17:40.684
You find anything?

17:40.720 --> 17:43.120
Eddie interacted
a number of times

17:43.160 --> 17:46.129
with a user named
IntegerOverflow.

17:46.160 --> 17:50.324
It appears Mr. Overflow searched
for the games himself in 2009,

17:50.370 --> 17:53.089
but failed
to find them.
"IntegerOverflow:

17:53.140 --> 17:55.734
"Beachwood only had trash up
to '79.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.806
"ArtifactEddie:
What about Flushing Avenue?

17:57.840 --> 17:59.637
"IntegerOverflow: The map

17:59.670 --> 18:01.206
I have is spotty,
but you can have it."

18:01.240 --> 18:02.605
Okay. So they were
sharing information.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.677
More specifically,
IntegerOverflow was sharing

18:05.710 --> 18:07.712
the benefits of
his past efforts.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.446
What's notably absent from
these posts is any mention

18:10.490 --> 18:13.687
of how the maps and other
materials passed hands.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.813
So you think
they met in person?

18:15.860 --> 18:18.420
That is a distinct possibility.

18:18.460 --> 18:22.419
If Eddie found the games
with so much help from Overflow,

18:22.460 --> 18:25.725
perhaps Overflow felt entitled
to the spoils.

18:25.770 --> 18:28.830
Is there any way
to get Overflow's real name?

18:28.870 --> 18:31.430
I have put that very question
to our friends at Everyone.

18:31.470 --> 18:33.472
I should be hearing back
shortly.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.772
Though I'm loathe to imagine

18:35.810 --> 18:38.677
what fresh tortures they will
conjure up as payment.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.711
Oh. How'd it go with Alfredo?

18:41.750 --> 18:43.581
(sighs deeply)

18:43.620 --> 18:45.315
We are both aware
of the unintended

18:45.350 --> 18:49.309
yet unavoidable consequences
to my changes in routine.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.851
When we made the transition
from sponsorship to friendship,

18:51.890 --> 18:54.450
we made the occasional effort
to soqalize.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.765
But it became apparent that our
shared experience in recovery

18:57.800 --> 19:00.234
was our friendship.

19:00.270 --> 19:04.309
So I guess you two
don't have much else in common.

19:04.340 --> 19:07.537
In the same way that many drug
users only relate to one another

19:07.580 --> 19:09.673
because they use drugs,
the thing that Alfredo and I

19:09.710 --> 19:13.373
did together was not use them,
so... (clicks tongue)

19:13.420 --> 19:15.809
It is a conundrum, to be sure.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.444
(doorbell buzzes)

19:21.660 --> 19:22.752
(unlocking door)

19:26.560 --> 19:28.699
It's from Everyone.

19:50.750 --> 19:53.753
"Finish me."

19:53.790 --> 19:55.815
(8-bit music playing,
sound effects blipping)

20:03.430 --> 20:04.397
WATSON: (gasps) Look out!

20:04.430 --> 20:05.727
I'm looking out.
(sighs)

20:05.770 --> 20:06.862
You have to go left. Left!

20:06.900 --> 20:09.368
Do you mind?
I'm trying to help.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.606
(blipping)

20:10.640 --> 20:11.766
Your help has just resulted

20:11.810 --> 20:13.732
in that man's murder.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.769
Again.
Okay,

20:14.810 --> 20:16.539
first of all,
he wasn't murdered--

20:16.580 --> 20:17.501
he was zapped
into another dimension.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.745
And second of all,
he still has two lives left.

20:19.780 --> 20:21.771
Yes, yes, of course, that's
what happens in real life.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.481
If you die, you get
two more chances.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.408
Somewhere, two
more Eddie Rosses

20:25.450 --> 20:27.418
have just resumed
digging their hole.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.815
Okay, don't get grumpy with me
just because Everyone

20:29.860 --> 20:31.748
is making you finish
this old video game.

20:31.790 --> 20:33.599
What are you even supposed to do
once you're finished?

20:33.630 --> 20:35.325
It's not like they left us
instructions.
Well, obviously

20:35.360 --> 20:36.827
they want proof that I
finished the game. So I'm sure

20:36.860 --> 20:38.418
a photograph of the final
screen will suffice.

20:38.470 --> 20:39.823
And then Everyone
will provide us

20:39.870 --> 20:41.735
with IntegerOverflow's
real name.

20:46.470 --> 20:48.870
May I?

20:51.810 --> 20:53.619
(electronic whirring, blipping;
music resumes)

20:53.650 --> 20:55.845
According to my research,
Swords of Saturn

20:55.880 --> 20:58.713
was one of the best
games of the era.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.513
If Nottingham Knights was one
of the worst,

21:00.560 --> 21:04.656
then consignment to a landfill
was too kind a fate.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.658
Well, it appears you
have some aptitude

21:06.690 --> 21:07.952
for avoiding
digital blobs.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.321
I told you. I had one
of these consoles growing up.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.667
I've played this game before.

21:11.700 --> 21:15.488
A fact you could've
shared several hours ago.

21:15.540 --> 21:16.495
(fanfare playing)

21:16.540 --> 21:18.337
(gasps)
Yes! Yes.

21:18.370 --> 21:19.803
My hero.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.035
Okay, so where
do you want this sent?

21:22.080 --> 21:25.800
Well, it appears we don't
have to send it anywhere.

21:25.850 --> 21:28.842
WATSON: Oh. "Sound by
Integer Overflow."

21:28.880 --> 21:30.814
So making us play the game
wasn't the price of the answer--

21:30.850 --> 21:34.581
_it was the answer.
This is elegant, even by
Everyone's standards.

21:34.620 --> 21:37.521
All right. So now all
we have to do is find out

21:37.560 --> 21:39.425
who designed the sound
for this game.

21:39.460 --> 21:41.052
There's got to be
a record somewhere.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.922
Check the Internet.
I'm going to go ice my thumb.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.368
You think I killed Eddie Ross

21:50.410 --> 21:52.867
over the Nottingham Knights
games.

21:52.910 --> 21:56.835
You do go by the online handle
IntegerOverflow, do you not?

21:56.880 --> 21:57.949
I do.

21:57.980 --> 21:59.641
And can you tell us
where you were

21:59.680 --> 22:01.375
two nights ago,
around 2:00 am?

22:01.420 --> 22:03.388
Here. Alone.

22:03.420 --> 22:05.342
_ You and Eddie were
in communication on and off

22:05.390 --> 22:07.358
the discussion board.
We think he may have found

22:07.390 --> 22:09.085
a stash of video games worth
millions of dollars

22:09.120 --> 22:10.849
thanks to your help.

22:10.890 --> 22:13.791
HOLMES:
We suspect that your
career as a composer

22:13.830 --> 22:17.027
of ear-splitting digital
music peaked in the early '805.

22:17.060 --> 22:18.789
So perhaps when Eddie
found those games,

22:18.830 --> 22:21.367
you felt your ship
had finally come in.

22:22.940 --> 22:24.931
I'm sorry. Is there
something funny about all this?

22:24.970 --> 22:26.961
Little bit.

22:27.010 --> 22:28.898
You want to let us in
on the joke?

22:28.940 --> 22:30.908
You're way off.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.906
I didn't kill Eddie,

22:32.950 --> 22:35.942
and I didn't take
any Nottingham Knights games.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.016
No one could've taken them.

22:38.050 --> 22:39.915
And why's that?

22:40.960 --> 22:43.349
Come on. I'll show you.

22:45.860 --> 22:49.023
(crickets chirping)

22:59.010 --> 23:00.898
I understand you're new at this,
Mr. Ostrin,

23:00.940 --> 23:03.033
but revealing you're
in possession of the very items

23:03.080 --> 23:05.105
we believe a man was killed over

23:05.150 --> 23:07.641
is not a great way
of clearing yourself.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.648
These are the games
that EmeryVision dumped

23:09.680 --> 23:11.887
in a landfill in 1980.

23:11.920 --> 23:15.583
Only no one killed Eddie
over them.

23:15.620 --> 23:16.951
Because Eddie
didn't find them.

23:18.690 --> 23:19.952
I did.

23:19.990 --> 23:23.426
Six years ago.
In a totally different landfill.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.823
And you can prove that?

23:24.870 --> 23:28.067
Only with about 100 hours
of video.

23:28.100 --> 23:30.432
I recorded every step.

23:30.470 --> 23:33.166
Thought it would make
for a good documentary one day.

23:33.210 --> 23:35.075
You were helping him
on the discussion board.

23:35.110 --> 23:38.443
I was leading him
on a wild-goose chase.

23:38.480 --> 23:42.871
Looks like you've
been on one, too.

23:42.920 --> 23:46.481
Sorry, but whatever Eddie found
in that hole,

23:46.520 --> 23:47.987
it wasn't these games.

23:56.130 --> 23:58.018
BELL: Dwight Ostrin's
story checks out.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.630
And he's had the Nottingham
Knights games for six years.

24:00.670 --> 24:03.468
He held onto his digging
permits, video footage,

24:03.510 --> 24:05.899
even nondisclosure agreements
from the crew that helped him.

24:05.940 --> 24:09.171
Pretty thorough for a guy
who was hiding the fact
that he found 'em.

24:12.810 --> 24:14.914
In the meantime,
he's been selling one
online, every few months,

24:14.950 --> 24:16.975
and claiming it was one
of the advance copies

24:17.020 --> 24:18.214
Tyler Eggert told us about,

24:18.250 --> 24:20.650
the ones that went out
to reviewers in 1980.

24:20.690 --> 24:22.658
Got almost ten grand apiece
for them.

24:22.690 --> 24:25.079
If they're so valuable,
why sit on them?

24:25.130 --> 24:27.792
Why keep them a secret?
Supply and demand.

24:27.830 --> 24:29.821
They're only valuable
because they're so rare.

24:29.860 --> 24:31.828
And there's only
a small number of people
who'd spend money on them.

24:31.870 --> 24:34.065
Flood the market
with 1,000 copies,

24:34.100 --> 24:35.965
and the price would plummet.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.798
BELL:
Best thing he could do was
act like he never found them,

24:38.840 --> 24:41.104
keep feeding the hype
around the legend. That's why

24:41.140 --> 24:42.732
he was pretending
to help Eddie.

24:42.780 --> 24:44.668
So where's
this leave us?

24:44.710 --> 24:46.678
Not quite square one,
but close.

24:46.710 --> 24:48.246
We haven't been able
to find anyone

24:48.280 --> 24:50.009
who had a problem with Eddie.

24:50.050 --> 24:51.608
It's possible
he walked in on a burglar,

24:51.650 --> 24:53.049
_ but as far
as his family can tell,

24:53.090 --> 24:55.217
nothing of value is missing
from his apartment.

24:55.260 --> 24:56.852
Nothing they knew about,
at least.

24:56.890 --> 24:57.959
What do you mean?

24:57.990 --> 24:59.958
Eddie was out of work
and single.

24:59.990 --> 25:03.096
He had nothing else going on
in his life aside from the dig.

25:03.130 --> 25:05.166
It still feels
like it's the best lead we have.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.758
So you think he went looking
for the games

25:06.800 --> 25:08.734
and he found something else?
Well, maybe

25:08.770 --> 25:10.738
there was some other kind
of hidden treasure,

25:10.770 --> 25:12.169
one that somebody else wanted.

25:12.210 --> 25:14.132
Send CSU back to the hole
he dug.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.136
See if anything
new comes up.

25:16.180 --> 25:20.913
I will, but the building owner
won't be too happy about it.

25:20.950 --> 25:23.145
He wants the hole filled.
He gave us an earful

25:23.180 --> 25:24.943
when we went
to see him yesterday.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.946
Well, tell him I got
his earful right here.

25:26.990 --> 25:29.879
Feel free to give
him my number.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.097
Sherlock.

25:40.130 --> 25:41.165
Hi.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.997
Martin.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.337
Yes, I remember.

25:44.370 --> 25:47.771
Ah. Got your 30-day chip
last week, right?

25:47.810 --> 25:49.038
I did.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.229
Feels good, right?

25:50.280 --> 25:52.009
You should be proud.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.018
Yes, well, actually,
it's my second time.

25:54.050 --> 25:56.610
I, um... Prior to last month,

25:56.650 --> 25:59.881
I had three years.
Mm.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.013
Did better than me.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.858
Four relapses
in my first three years.

26:04.890 --> 26:06.323
Didn't think
I was gonna make it.

26:06.360 --> 26:10.968
But look at me now--
22 years clean.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.195
(quiet chuckle)

26:27.010 --> 26:29.149
There's more, you know.

26:29.180 --> 26:30.989
What?

26:31.020 --> 26:35.081
Donuts. Over there.

26:39.130 --> 26:41.849
You okay?

26:41.900 --> 26:43.765
Was there another meeting here
earlier?

26:43.800 --> 26:48.191
Yeah, there was one at 8:00.
Why?

26:54.110 --> 26:55.771
Joan?

26:55.810 --> 26:58.199
Yeah. Back here.

26:59.380 --> 27:02.838
Is this everything
the Department of
Sanitation sent over?

27:02.880 --> 27:04.245
Yes, records for all
the other companies

27:04.290 --> 27:07.953
that dumped their garbage
in the same landfill
where Eddie was digging.

27:07.990 --> 27:10.413
Hmm. Did any of them
throw anything away that
sounds like treasure?

27:10.460 --> 27:12.223
No. Actually,
just the opposite.

27:12.260 --> 27:15.388
But the name Corrigan Chemical
came up a few times.

27:15.430 --> 27:17.421
I recognized the name,
so I did a search.

27:17.460 --> 27:19.928
It _turns out
that Corrigan was caught

27:19.970 --> 27:21.995
illegally dumping
toxic chemicals

27:22.040 --> 27:25.305
in two other landfills
in 1985.

27:25.340 --> 27:27.228
You're thinking maybe they did
the same thing here?

27:27.270 --> 27:29.830
Say they did,
and Eddie found proof,

27:29.880 --> 27:31.302
and then threatened
to go public.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.818
Someone at that company
might have killed him

27:33.850 --> 27:35.818
to keep him quiet.

27:35.850 --> 27:37.408
WOMAN :
Detective Bell?

27:37.450 --> 27:39.884
Amy Kim. I heard

27:39.920 --> 27:41.114
you have questions
about Corrigan.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.980
Yeah. This is my
colleague, Ms. Watson.

27:43.020 --> 27:44.726
Actually, we're
a little confused.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.182
We thought this
was Corrigan.

27:46.230 --> 27:48.289
Brower acquired Corrigan
in 1998.

27:48.330 --> 27:50.150
We keep this as the address
of record,

27:50.200 --> 27:52.020
so any inquiries come here.

27:52.070 --> 27:54.129
Handling those inquiries
is part of my job.

27:54.170 --> 27:55.990
So, how can I help?

27:56.040 --> 27:59.237
Actually, it's probably best
if we discuss it in private.

28:04.910 --> 28:07.242
This is the first
I'm hearing of any of this.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.872
Your victim-- Mr. Ross?

28:08.920 --> 28:10.911
I can assure you
he never approached us.

28:10.950 --> 28:13.953
Couple of hours ago,
the EPA ran some tests

28:13.990 --> 28:16.185
on the soil Mr. Ross took
from the landfill.

28:16.220 --> 28:18.780
The results showed
high levels of dioxin.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.457
That's the chemical your company

28:20.490 --> 28:22.219
was charged
with dumping illegally

28:22.260 --> 28:23.818
at two other sites.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.724
Not our company. Corrigan.

28:25.770 --> 28:27.362
We acquired them
after these incidents

28:27.400 --> 28:29.163
took place.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.065
Whatever they did before
isn't our responsibility.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.408
I could see how that would be
Brower's position, but...

28:33.440 --> 28:36.238
It's a fact, and to be
honest, I don't think

28:36.280 --> 28:39.078
Corrigan would be
held liable, either.
What do you mean?

28:39.110 --> 28:41.772
They hired
an independent contractor

28:41.820 --> 28:44.209
to dispose
of their hazardous waste.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.389
They paid the full rates
for a proper disposal.

28:46.420 --> 28:49.082
The contractor, apparently,
cut corners

28:49.120 --> 28:51.782
and disposed of the waste
illegally by reporting it

28:51.830 --> 28:54.219
as inert materials.

28:54.260 --> 28:56.399
None of that has anything
to do with Brower.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.295
A court might feel differently.

28:58.330 --> 29:02.391
Maybe, but so far, the courts
have ruled in our favor.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.761
Three similar
cases have come up

29:04.810 --> 29:06.903
since I started here,
and Brower was cleared

29:06.940 --> 29:09.204
of liability in all three.

29:09.240 --> 29:11.902
I can show you the cases.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.544
In one of them,
the state paid

29:14.580 --> 29:16.218
for the whole cleanup.

29:16.250 --> 29:20.516
In another, the current
property owner was on the hook.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.086
WATSON:
Are you talking about

29:22.120 --> 29:23.951
the person
who bought the property

29:23.990 --> 29:25.287
after the landfill was sealed?

29:25.330 --> 29:27.355
Yeah, doesn't seem fair,
does it?

29:27.390 --> 29:29.324
But that's how
the Superfund law works.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.191
It's like buying a used car.

29:31.230 --> 29:33.027
You need to check
under the hood,

29:33.070 --> 29:35.561
because once you pay for it,
it's yours, warts and all.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.205
The building owner.

29:38.240 --> 29:39.366
The one who was in a hurry

29:39.410 --> 29:41.230
to fill in the hole
that Eddie Ross dug.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.475
Maybe that's not just
because it's an eyesore.

29:45.310 --> 29:47.403
Mr. Brice, when Ms. Watson
and I visited you

29:47.450 --> 29:48.872
in your office yesterday,

29:48.920 --> 29:51.309
we asked you if you'd ever
heard of Eddie Ross.

29:52.920 --> 29:55.252
Thing is, we went back
and had a longer conversation

29:55.290 --> 29:56.882
with your secretary Elaine.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.558
You should know,
she's very loyal to you.

29:58.590 --> 30:01.093
She started out insisting
she didn't remember anything.

30:01.130 --> 30:02.392
GREGSON:
Once we pointed out to her

30:02.430 --> 30:03.966
that she could
go to prison

30:04.000 --> 30:05.968
for hindering prosecution,
her memory cleared up.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.094
WATSON: She said that Eddie
came to your office twice.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.233
The first time was
about two weeks ago.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.158
According to Elaine,

30:13.210 --> 30:15.531
he asked your permission
to dig behind your building.

30:15.580 --> 30:18.242
Your super said he claimed
to work for the city,

30:18.280 --> 30:19.804
so we're guessing
you said no.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.346
Elaine is a sweet woman,
but she's obviously mistaken.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.585
I don't recall
any of this.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.281
MAN:
Which makes all of it

30:28.320 --> 30:30.288
"he-said, she-said" at best.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.084
Sounds to me like
you coerced a statement.

30:33.130 --> 30:35.257
We'll see if a judge agrees.

30:35.300 --> 30:36.927
Well, it's understandable
you don't remember.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.325
You're a busy man.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.429
And Eddie Ross's hunt
for discarded video games

30:40.470 --> 30:42.859
probably ranks quite low
on your list of priorities.

30:42.900 --> 30:45.334
But we imagine his second visit
left a more lasting impression.

30:45.370 --> 30:48.203
The only thing that your
secretary could tell us about it

30:48.240 --> 30:50.879
was that you quickly pulled
Eddie behind closed doors.

30:50.910 --> 30:53.049
See, we think
he'd approached you

30:53.080 --> 30:55.139
with evidence
of what he'd found.

30:55.180 --> 30:57.614
Chemical drums
that contained toxic waste.

30:57.650 --> 31:00.118
He had the expertise
to identify the drums.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.357
He had the equipment
to test the soil.

31:02.390 --> 31:05.223
He almost certainly
understood what he had found

31:05.260 --> 31:06.659
and its ramifications to you.

31:06.690 --> 31:09.227
Now, perhaps he came to you
in good faith,

31:09.260 --> 31:11.399
to give you a chance
to remedy the situation,

31:11.430 --> 31:14.194
or perhaps he offered
to forget what he had seen

31:14.240 --> 31:16.299
in exchange for a tidy sum.

31:16.340 --> 31:18.501
Either way,
you settled on a third option.

31:18.540 --> 31:21.236
WATSON: I did some research.
It turns out

31:21.280 --> 31:22.679
your building is in escrow,

31:22.710 --> 31:24.940
along with a row
of adjacent properties.

31:24.980 --> 31:26.345
You're about 15 days away

31:26.380 --> 31:29.042
from closing
on a ten-million-dollar sale.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.945
Toxic waste would have been
a deal killer.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.117
You'd be out all that money,
not to mention

31:33.150 --> 31:35.084
facing lawsuits
from all of your tenants.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.281
Much easier to just
get rid of Eddie Ross.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.049
Right?

31:39.090 --> 31:42.457
GREGSON:
Brower Chemical, the company
that bought the company

31:42.500 --> 31:45.264
that did the dumping, has
been cooperating fully.

31:45.300 --> 31:46.460
Using their records,

31:46.500 --> 31:48.639
we've been able
to figure out exactly

31:48.670 --> 31:51.935
how many drums of waste
were buried at that landfill.

31:51.970 --> 31:56.407
We executed a search warrant on
your property this afternoon,

31:56.440 --> 31:58.340
using ground-penetrating radar.

31:58.380 --> 32:00.701
And guess what?

32:00.750 --> 32:03.446
You're two drums short.

32:03.480 --> 32:05.016
Obviously, they're the two drums

32:05.050 --> 32:06.517
that Eddie uncovered
when he was digging.

32:06.550 --> 32:09.383
So, who aside from you, would
have had reason to move them?

32:09.420 --> 32:14.494
I'd like a moment alone
With my attorney.

32:14.530 --> 32:17.727
(muffled, indistinct
conversation)

32:17.760 --> 32:20.467
You're not even gonna
try to read lips.

32:20.500 --> 32:22.388
Their backs are to us.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.328
Well, it's never
stopped you before.

32:24.370 --> 32:26.099
Oh, how was the meeting?

32:26.140 --> 32:28.529
When Alfredo came
to the brownstone the other day,

32:28.580 --> 32:30.707
you're certain that he said
I hadn't been to any

32:32.680 --> 32:34.443
Yes.
And those were
his exact words?

32:34.480 --> 32:36.539
WATSON :
Yes. Why?

32:36.580 --> 32:38.980
(knocking on glass)

32:41.720 --> 32:44.223
My client's statement.

32:44.260 --> 32:46.353
He admits to having
removed the drums.

32:46.390 --> 32:47.755
He was just getting around

32:47.790 --> 32:50.293
to letting the buyer know
about them.

32:50.330 --> 32:51.763
The sale will probably fall
through, and you're right--

32:51.800 --> 32:53.722
he'll probably
face some civil

32:53.770 --> 32:56.432
complaints-- but what he won't
be facing is a murder charge.

32:56.470 --> 32:58.062
BELL:
How do you figure that?

32:58.110 --> 32:59.566
Your client still
hasn't accounted

32:59.610 --> 33:01.532
for his whereabouts
three nights ago.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.536
There's the name
and address

33:03.580 --> 33:05.172
of a garage out in Hoboken.

33:05.210 --> 33:07.303
My client's company
keeps a truck there.

33:07.350 --> 33:09.045
I'm sure they have
security cameras.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.445
I'd recommend
you reVIew the footage

33:10.480 --> 33:12.516
around 1:00 am. that night.

33:12.550 --> 33:14.552
Should answer
all your questions.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.492
WATSON:
Just like he wrote
in his statement.

33:23.530 --> 33:25.566
He hired those workers
to move the drums,

33:25.600 --> 33:28.239
_ and he let them use _
his company's truck to do it.

33:28.270 --> 33:30.192
And he did it
at the same time

33:30.240 --> 33:32.458
the fire broke out
at Eddie Ross's place.

33:32.510 --> 33:36.173
A despicable alibi,
but an alibi nonetheless.

33:36.210 --> 33:39.509
Duncan Brice is not our killer.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.257
(8-bit music plays,
electronic blipping)

33:50.290 --> 33:52.724
What are you doing?
I'm punishing my brain.

33:52.760 --> 33:55.399
And what did your brain
do to deserve punishment?

33:55.430 --> 33:57.091
It's what it didn't do.

33:57.130 --> 33:59.564
We know that Duncan Brice
is an abhorrent human being

33:59.600 --> 34:01.636
who'd rather hide
evidence of toxic waste

34:01.670 --> 34:03.661
than protect his tenants.

34:03.700 --> 34:06.339
And he's almost certainly
behind the death of Eddie Ross.

34:06.370 --> 34:08.577
Right. He had an accomplice--
someone who went to kill Eddie

34:08.610 --> 34:10.100
while Duncan dealt
with the drums.

34:10.140 --> 34:11.505
That's why we went
to separate quarters--

34:11.550 --> 34:13.279
to try and ﬁgure out
who it was, right?

34:13.310 --> 34:14.641
I've been pouring through
the man's life for hours now,

34:14.680 --> 34:16.170
trying to find someone
he would plausibly

34:16.220 --> 34:17.517
approach for such a task,

34:17.550 --> 34:19.279
and I have nothing
to show for it.

34:19.320 --> 34:21.515
How fares your brain?

34:21.560 --> 34:24.620
Actually, it thinks
it found something.

34:26.490 --> 34:28.492
Four years ago, there was a
fire that gutted a building

34:28.530 --> 34:29.724
owned by Duncan Brice.

34:29.760 --> 34:33.594
It was ruled accidental,
but...

34:33.630 --> 34:34.790
the building was
well-insured.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.569
They payout was
in the millions.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.665
You're suggesting

34:39.710 --> 34:42.270
this fire was set deliberately?
It wouldn't be the first time

34:42.310 --> 34:45.302
_ someone like Brice used_
insurance to ﬁnance a rebUIld.

34:45.350 --> 34:46.806
Let's say I'm right.

34:46.850 --> 34:49.114
Four years ago, he
hires an arsonist.

34:49.150 --> 34:50.708
Then, three nights ago,

34:50.750 --> 34:53.310
he realized he needed
Eddie Ross dead.

34:53.350 --> 34:54.749
Now, Brice isn't a Mob boss.

34:54.790 --> 34:56.610
He doesn't know dozens
of criminals for hire.

34:56.660 --> 34:58.719
He only knows one,
so he calls him.

34:58.760 --> 35:02.150
If this was arson-- and that's
a considerable "if"--

35:02.200 --> 35:03.656
it was carried out
so meticulously

35:03.700 --> 35:05.463
that it was never detected.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.889
Eddie Ross's murder
was a mess.

35:07.930 --> 35:10.433
The weapon used
was one of opportunity--

35:10.470 --> 35:12.199
a trowel left lying around.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.901
Now, no one goes
to commit a murder

35:13.940 --> 35:15.874
hoping there's going
to be a weapon handy,

35:15.910 --> 35:17.571
least of all a professional.

35:17.610 --> 35:19.749
I thought about that,
and then I remembered

35:19.780 --> 35:21.714
something you said
in the morgue the other day.

35:21.750 --> 35:22.842
Eddie's neighbor
told police

35:22.880 --> 35:24.745
she smelled gas, not gasoline.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.611
Marcus thought she got confused,
but what if she didn't?

35:27.650 --> 35:30.778
Go on.
What if the killer was
planning to set a fire that was

35:30.820 --> 35:33.425
supposed to look like a gas
leak, but then Eddie woke up

35:33.460 --> 35:35.758
and walked in on him?
Once things got messy,

35:35.800 --> 35:38.598
there'd be no point in staging
a fire that looked accidental.

35:38.630 --> 35:40.621
HOLMES: So he replaced
the gas with petrol.

35:40.670 --> 35:43.639
Needed to be sure he left
no trace of himself on the body.

35:43.670 --> 35:47.606
Figure out who
committed this arson...

35:47.640 --> 35:51.201
then maybe we'll figure out
who committed this one.

35:55.350 --> 35:57.238
(low, indistinct talking)

35:57.280 --> 35:58.281
(quiet laughter)

36:01.660 --> 36:02.456
Anything you have to say,
call my lavwer.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.355
I'm not talking to you
without him.

36:04.390 --> 36:07.359
Actually, you're not going to
have to do any talking at all.

36:07.390 --> 36:08.721
Nice building.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.853
Can see why you'd want
to have offices in it.

36:10.900 --> 36:13.767
The building that used to
occupy this space was a dump,

36:13.800 --> 36:15.665
so, it's a small wonder
you had it burned down

36:15.700 --> 36:18.533
so your insurance company
would pay for an upgrade.

36:18.570 --> 36:20.629
Is the NYPD looking
for a slander suit?

36:20.670 --> 36:22.672
BELL:
You hired a professional

36:22.710 --> 36:24.575
torch named
Vladimir Orlov

36:24.610 --> 36:26.874
to set a fire in this building
four years ago,

36:26.910 --> 36:29.617
and to kill Eddie Ross
four nights ago.

36:29.650 --> 36:30.912
No. I've never
seen that man before.

36:30.950 --> 36:32.588
WATSON:
When this building

36:32.620 --> 36:35.714
burned down in 2011,
the smoke detector in the unit

36:35.760 --> 36:37.512
where the fire started
never went off.

36:37.560 --> 36:38.686
The batteries were dead,

36:38.730 --> 36:40.459
even though
the building manager swore

36:40.490 --> 36:42.526
he had just replaced them
a week before.

36:42.560 --> 36:43.993
GREGSON: There was no
other sign of foul play,

36:44.030 --> 36:45.588
so no one thought much of it.

36:45.630 --> 36:47.518
But after everything
that's happened

36:47.570 --> 36:50.539
the last few days,
it jumped out at us.

36:50.570 --> 36:52.731
We wonder-- did your arsonist
replace the fresh batteries

36:52.770 --> 36:55.307
with dead ones to delay the
arrival of the fire department?

36:55.340 --> 36:56.876
And if he did so in 2011,

36:56.910 --> 36:59.743
did he also do so in 2015?
WATSON:
Turns out he had.

36:59.780 --> 37:02.613
But when things went sideways,
and he had to undo the fire

37:02.650 --> 37:04.948
he was planning to set,
he put the good batteries back

37:04.990 --> 37:06.446
into Eddie's smoke detector.

37:06.490 --> 37:07.684
BELL:
Unfortunately for him,

37:07.720 --> 37:09.358
well, and for you,

37:09.390 --> 37:11.950
the new fire was concentrated
around Eddie's body.

37:11.990 --> 37:13.924
Didn't do any damage
to the smoke detector,

37:13.960 --> 37:16.929
or to the prints Vladimir Orlov
left on the batteries.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.996
We've had him in custody
the last few hours.

37:19.030 --> 37:20.668
He named you

37:20.700 --> 37:22.395
as the guy who hired him

37:22.440 --> 37:24.829
to kill Eddie Ross.

37:24.870 --> 37:27.805
Duncan Brice,
you're under arrest.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.876
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:29.910 --> 37:33.607
Anything you say can be
used against you in court.

37:38.550 --> 37:40.814
You know what doesn't scare me
at all?

37:40.850 --> 37:42.556
Coming back to my garage

37:42.590 --> 37:44.820
and finding some strange
white guy let himself in.

37:44.860 --> 37:48.398
Not like that's ever gone badly
for me.

37:48.430 --> 37:50.557
Sorry. I was waiting outside,

37:50.600 --> 37:52.659
and I got bored,
so I came inside.

37:52.700 --> 37:54.497
And then I got bored again.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.667
You tell me you came up
with a solution

37:56.700 --> 37:58.531
for that wiring problem,
all is forgiven.

37:58.570 --> 38:00.538
So what's up?

38:00.570 --> 38:01.832
You doing okay?

38:01.880 --> 38:04.804
Uh, actually, I was,
I was wondering if, uh...

38:04.850 --> 38:06.909
you were okay.

38:08.350 --> 38:11.342
Um, the other day,
you told Watson

38:11.390 --> 38:13.745
that I had not been
to any of the meetings

38:13.790 --> 38:16.350
at St. Luke's
that whole past week.

38:16.390 --> 38:18.483
That's right.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.987
Right. St. Luke's holds
five meetings a week.

38:21.030 --> 38:23.692
You typically attend
two of them.

38:23.730 --> 38:25.698
It occurred to me
you wouldn't know

38:25.730 --> 38:29.496
I hadn't been to any unless
you had been to all of them.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.701
And then, yesterday,

38:31.740 --> 38:33.105
at an entirely
different meeting,

38:33.140 --> 38:34.835
I noticed this box of donuts

38:34.880 --> 38:36.768
from the shop up the street,

38:36.810 --> 38:38.801
that you like.

38:38.850 --> 38:41.819
So you'd been to that meeting
just before, had you not?

38:41.850 --> 38:44.648
What if I had?
Okay.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.784
Well, obviously, it means
you're attending more meetings

38:47.820 --> 38:49.515
than you usually do.

38:49.560 --> 38:50.959
And that would suggest

38:50.990 --> 38:53.049
that you're struggling
with something.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.694
I just didn't want
to put this on you.

38:57.730 --> 38:59.129
Put what on me?

38:59.170 --> 39:02.367
I don't know. I'm... down.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.129
And before you
even think it--

39:04.170 --> 39:06.365
it has nothing to do
with Oscar Rankin.

39:06.410 --> 39:07.934
What does it have to do with?

39:07.970 --> 39:09.801
If I knew that,
I wouldn't have gone

39:09.840 --> 39:11.000
to eight meetings this week.

39:11.040 --> 39:14.009
Well, you know,
I am your friend, so...

39:14.050 --> 39:17.019
you could have told me.

39:17.050 --> 39:19.814
You just got your 30-day chip.

39:19.850 --> 39:22.853
And helping you
would be good for me.

39:22.890 --> 39:24.551
Right?

39:24.590 --> 39:27.024
You've always suggested

39:27.060 --> 39:28.857
that I should sometimes
be selfish

39:28.900 --> 39:31.425
with regards to my sobriety,
and yet, here you are

39:31.470 --> 39:34.439
with yours at stake,
and you choose to be selfless.

39:34.470 --> 39:35.937
* Religion...

39:35.970 --> 39:37.938
Shame on you.

39:37.970 --> 39:40.905
* Religion...

39:40.940 --> 39:43.033
(laughs)

39:43.080 --> 39:44.945
* No, oh, oh...

39:44.980 --> 39:46.971
You got plans tonight?

39:59.730 --> 40:01.527

40:01.560 --> 40:02.891
I guess we'll find out.

40:02.930 --> 40:04.625

40:04.670 --> 40:07.491
