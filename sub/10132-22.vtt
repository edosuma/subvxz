Last week..

00:05.631 --> 00:07.758
This weekend,

00:05.631 --> 00:07.758
I'm going to tell Becky

00:07.800 --> 00:10.511
the three little words that

00:07.800 --> 00:10.511
every woman wants to hear.

00:10.552 --> 00:12.513
I did something

00:10.552 --> 00:12.513
this morning with Todd

00:12.554 --> 00:15.307
that every woman in

00:12.554 --> 00:15.307
America fantasizes about.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.434
[crowd exclaiming]

00:17.476 --> 00:19.311
And then..

00:19.353 --> 00:21.689
It's a date. I'll have

00:19.353 --> 00:21.689
my driver pick you at 7.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.022
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:23.064 --> 00:25.066
You're making

00:23.064 --> 00:25.066
a really big mistake.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.652
Oh, really?

00:26.694 --> 00:29.404
This is the last mistake

00:26.694 --> 00:29.404
I make with you then, okay?

00:29.446 --> 00:32.115
'Cause that's it. We're

00:29.446 --> 00:32.115
finished. We're breakin' up.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.742
Well, fine.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.742
Then it's over.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.536
Uh-oh!

00:35.577 --> 00:38.079
And it just so happens that the

00:35.577 --> 00:38.079
blow-dried side of beef and I

00:38.121 --> 00:40.499
were gonna have

00:38.121 --> 00:40.499
dinner tonight with you.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.002
Whoa, I'm a jerk.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.880
I was gonna tell

00:44.169 --> 00:45.880
you that I love you.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.214
I love you too.

00:47.255 --> 00:50.258
Whoa! That means we're in love.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.093
Yes! We're in Nevada.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.440

- Yes.

- Have mercy.

I always do things like this.

I love this. Here.

Look, we don't need

04:35.984 --> 04:37.485

04:37.527 --> 04:39.154
with all kinds of people.

04:39.196 --> 04:43.450

04:39.196 --> 04:43.450

04:48.163 --> 04:50.624
it does sound romantic.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.251
It will be.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.128
Then after we get married,

04:52.292 --> 04:54.128
we'll throw a big party.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.837
We'll invite all our

04:55.879 --> 04:59.424
and a few others that might

bring us really nice gifts.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.009

this should be

05:02.719 --> 05:04.345
- Okay.

this a secret, so we gotta..

08:15.620 --> 08:17.831
Oh-h, by the way,

08:15.620 --> 08:17.831
do you have a wedding ring?

08:17.872 --> 08:20.708
Because we have a fabulous

08:17.872 --> 08:20.708
jewelry store here at the--

08:20.750 --> 08:22.710
Save it.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.710
I've been there already.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.213
Fabulous!

08:25.255 --> 08:27.548
Here it is.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.967
- Eh?

08:27.590 --> 08:28.967
- Hmm-mm!

08:29.009 --> 08:30.177
Alright, I gotta

08:29.009 --> 08:30.177
get back to Becky.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.179
- I'll see you.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.179
- Okay.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.722
It's so strange,

08:32.220 --> 08:34.722
I feel like I'm being watched.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.599
You're getting married.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.599
Get used to it.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.145
- See you at 2.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.145
- Okay.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.654
Ah-a! Our very first clue.

08:49.696 --> 08:53.033
Ah-a! But it's an empty bag.

08:53.074 --> 08:56.453
Ah-a. But it's from

08:53.074 --> 08:56.453
a jewelry store.

08:56.495 --> 08:58.830
Ah-a!

09:00.415 --> 09:02.583
There goes Becky.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.583
Let's follow her.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.965
Well, that's it.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.965
That's my last quarter.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.591
It's your machine.

09:16.473 --> 09:18.308
How could I lose?

09:18.350 --> 09:20.227
Well, it's simple, Shirley,

09:18.350 --> 09:20.227
you see..

09:20.268 --> 09:23.397
...you thought I spent

09:20.268 --> 09:23.397
my last quarter..

09:23.438 --> 09:24.939
...but I didn't.

09:29.610 --> 09:33.907
Yes! Oh, baby, the curse

09:29.610 --> 09:33.907
is broken. A $5 jackpot.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.575
And I am even.

09:36.868 --> 09:39.454
Shirley, the key to

09:36.868 --> 09:39.454
responsible gambling is

09:39.496 --> 09:41.581
knowing when to walk away.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.296
[machine ringing]

09:48.338 --> 09:51.174
$25!

09:51.216 --> 09:54.219
Oh, baby. Oh, baby.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.720
'Oh, baby!'

09:58.639 --> 10:00.225
Hi, Becky.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.394
Imagine us running

10:00.267 --> 10:02.394
into you here.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.521
How did your

10:02.436 --> 10:04.521
secret errands go?

10:04.563 --> 10:07.148
Uh, well, they

10:04.563 --> 10:07.148
weren't secret errands.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.067
There were, uh, boring errands.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.570
In fact, I can't even

10:09.109 --> 10:11.570
remember where I went or..

10:11.611 --> 10:12.904
...why I'm holding this bag.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.655
Becky, I just talked..

10:12.946 --> 10:14.655
Hi, girls.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.199
- Hello.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.535
Uh, Jess, why don't you

10:16.241 --> 10:18.535
talk to me out in the hallway

10:18.577 --> 10:21.037
where the, uh,

10:18.577 --> 10:21.037
light is better?

10:21.079 --> 10:23.123
That's right, the light

10:21.079 --> 10:23.123
is better. Uh, makes sense.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.084
Quick, Steph,

10:24.458 --> 10:26.084
search the room.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.884
Becky bought

10:32.132 --> 10:34.884
a new fancy dress.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.219
And a blue..

10:40.307 --> 10:41.933
...head band.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.228
Steph, look at this.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.897
They drew a heart around

10:45.270 --> 10:47.897
the Ali Baba Wedding Chapel.

10:50.275 --> 10:52.986
Uncle Jesse and Becky

10:50.275 --> 10:52.986
are getting married.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.447
We solved the mystery.

10:55.489 --> 10:58.325
Yay! We won!

10:55.489 --> 10:58.325
We won!

10:58.366 --> 11:02.203
Uncle Jesse and Becky

10:58.366 --> 11:02.203
are getting married?

11:02.245 --> 11:03.830
(Becky)

11:02.245 --> 11:03.830
'Girls, let us in.'

11:03.871 --> 11:06.791
Uh, don't tell Uncle Jesse

11:03.871 --> 11:06.791
and Becky we know.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.754
Uh, get the blue head band off.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.754
Go. Go. Quick.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.924
Go, hurry, hurry!

11:18.928 --> 11:21.139
- What's going on here?

11:18.928 --> 11:21.139
- Uh, nothing.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.224
The wind must have

11:21.181 --> 11:23.224
blew the door shut.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.018
And locked it.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.769
- Goodbye.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.398
You think those two

11:28.229 --> 11:30.398
are up to something?

11:31.732 --> 11:34.528
Uncle Jesse and Becky

11:31.732 --> 11:34.528
are getting married.

11:34.569 --> 11:37.947
Shh! I don't know why but they

11:34.569 --> 11:37.947
don't want us to know about it.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.824
So we gotta keep this a secret.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.909
Me keep this a secret?

11:41.951 --> 11:44.912
Do you know who

11:41.951 --> 11:44.912
you're talking to?

11:44.954 --> 11:46.540
- Hey, we're back.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.540
- Hi, chicks.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.249
- Hi.

11:48.291 --> 11:51.211
Hey, Michelle, how did you

11:48.291 --> 11:51.211
like swimming in Lake Tahoe?

11:51.252 --> 11:54.464
Was too cold!

11:51.252 --> 11:54.464
Brrr!

11:55.714 --> 11:58.134
So, girls, where's

11:55.714 --> 11:58.134
your Uncle Jess?

11:58.176 --> 12:00.220
Uh, Uncle Jesse?

12:01.346 --> 12:03.640
Never heard of him.

12:03.682 --> 12:07.561
- Somebody has a secret.

12:03.682 --> 12:07.561
- Unh-unh.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.229
Let's see, if we

12:07.602 --> 12:09.229
wanna get information

12:09.270 --> 12:12.815
outta these two girls,

12:09.270 --> 12:12.815
I think we ought to speak to..

12:12.857 --> 12:14.733
Stephanie.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.696
Okay. Come on, honey.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.696
You were born to blab.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.991
Come on. You know you're

12:19.906 --> 12:21.991
dying to tell somebody.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.536
- Mm-mmm.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.536
- Aw, Steph, come on.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.539
There's nothing more fun than

12:24.578 --> 12:27.539
blabbing a big juicy secret.

12:27.581 --> 12:31.084
- Well..

12:27.581 --> 12:31.084
- Fight it, Steph. Fight it!

12:32.711 --> 12:34.879
Spill those secret beans.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.964
Pardon me one moment.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.722
Jesse's getting married?

12:46.140 --> 12:48.184
Jesse's getting married?

12:48.226 --> 12:50.186
Blabbermouth.

12:50.228 --> 12:53.189
What makes you think that

12:50.228 --> 12:53.189
Jesse's getting married?

12:53.231 --> 12:56.484
Uncle Jesse bought

12:53.231 --> 12:56.484
something at a jewelry store.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.361
Becky bought a new dress.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.281
And look,

12:58.403 --> 13:01.281
the biggest clue of all.

13:01.322 --> 13:04.158
There's a heart around

13:01.322 --> 13:04.158
the Ali Baba Wedding Chapel.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.329
It does say

13:05.868 --> 13:08.329
2 o'clock right here.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.040
This is Jesse's handwriting.

13:11.082 --> 13:14.043
Looks to me like

13:11.082 --> 13:14.043
Jesse and Becky are eloping.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.587
Yeah, well,

13:14.085 --> 13:15.587
not if I can help it.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.297
If those two run off

13:15.629 --> 13:17.297
and get married like this

13:17.338 --> 13:19.507
it'll be the biggest

13:17.338 --> 13:19.507
mistake of their lives.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.800
We get five minutes

13:19.549 --> 13:21.800
to put a stop this wedding.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.011
Jesse's getting married.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.644
I've gotta stop Jesse

13:28.933 --> 13:30.644
and Becky from eloping.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.395
Danny, wait a minute.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.397
You and Pam ran off

13:32.437 --> 13:34.397
and got married.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.399
Yeah, and both of

13:34.439 --> 13:36.399
our families went crazy.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.359
My mom cried for a month.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.361
And I'm sure Jesse's

13:38.401 --> 13:40.361
forgetting how he felt.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.989
He was only 13,

13:40.403 --> 13:42.989
but he was very upset.

13:43.030 --> 13:46.075
He tried to beat me up.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.286
Danny, he did beat you up.

13:50.037 --> 13:53.916
Yeah, well, if you call

13:50.037 --> 13:53.916
a fractured rib beat up.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.835
Do you know what you're doing?

13:53.958 --> 13:56.835
Do you know what you're wearing?

13:56.877 --> 13:58.672
Come on! Let's go.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.718
- I'm with her.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.718
- Follow Michelle.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.307
When did Michelle take over?

14:11.142 --> 14:15.563
By the power vested in me,

14:11.142 --> 14:15.563
by the fabulous state of Nevada

14:15.605 --> 14:17.649
I now pronounce you

14:15.605 --> 14:17.649
husband and--

14:17.691 --> 14:20.527
Stop! You're making

14:17.691 --> 14:20.527
a horrible mistake.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.614
I fell like a total idiot.

14:24.656 --> 14:28.242
Well, you know what they say.

14:24.656 --> 14:28.242
Clothes make the man.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.453
Thank you very much.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.453
Have a happy life together.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.413
If you hurry you can

14:30.495 --> 14:32.413
have your parking validated

14:32.455 --> 14:33.998
at the front desk.

14:36.917 --> 14:40.129
- What're you guys doing here?

14:36.917 --> 14:40.129
- Jesse, don't do this.

14:40.171 --> 14:41.339
I'm trying to

14:40.171 --> 14:41.339
save you from making

14:41.381 --> 14:43.132
the same mistake

14:41.381 --> 14:43.132
that I made.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.884
Don't you remember how angry

14:43.174 --> 14:44.884
you were when you found out

14:44.925 --> 14:46.761
that I was eloping

14:44.925 --> 14:46.761
with your sister?

14:46.803 --> 14:51.057
Yeah, I beat you up.

14:46.803 --> 14:51.057
And I may do it again.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.933
We were gonna tell all of you

14:51.098 --> 14:52.933
tonight and then throw

14:52.975 --> 14:54.769
a big party for our family

14:52.975 --> 14:54.769
and friends when we get home.

14:54.811 --> 14:55.812
Yeah.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.313
I don't mean

14:55.854 --> 14:57.313
to rush everybody

14:57.355 --> 14:59.899
but the Coplemans have

14:57.355 --> 14:59.899
the chapel in 15 minutes.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.693
- Make that 12.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.693
- Alright.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.445
- We better get going.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.445
- Look...I'm sorry.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.448
I just had to get

15:05.613 --> 15:07.448
that off my chest.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.743
I want you both to know

15:07.490 --> 15:09.743
that I love you very much

15:09.784 --> 15:12.453
and I wish you

15:09.784 --> 15:12.453
nothing but happiness.

15:12.495 --> 15:15.998
Thank you, Danny.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.876
Come on, the Coplemans are

15:16.040 --> 15:17.876
breathing down your neck.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.586
- Get married already.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.586
- Alright.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.128
You guys are all here,

15:19.627 --> 15:21.128
I want you to stay.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.839

15:21.170 --> 15:22.839
- Alright.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.759
How would you girls like

15:24.257 --> 15:25.759
to be my bridesmaids?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.385
- Oh, yeah!

15:25.800 --> 15:27.385
- Alright!

15:27.427 --> 15:29.470
I want you two boys

15:27.427 --> 15:29.470
to be my best man..

15:29.512 --> 15:31.972
- Best men.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.972
- Yeah.

15:32.014 --> 15:35.268
Now it's a good thing I wore

15:32.014 --> 15:35.268
my formal Cabana suit.
