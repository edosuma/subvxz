05:31.798 --> 05:33.099

- I was more or less worried

05:36.636 --> 05:39.806
about the relationships,

05:39.872 --> 05:41.841
because I mean,
I know it's hard on any family

like that happens.

very patient with Ryan.

05:57.056 --> 05:58.524

07:40.526 --> 07:43.663
Ryan kind of didn't follow
through with some things, and--

07:43.729 --> 07:45.097
- What kinds of things?

07:45.164 --> 07:46.899
- Well, like,
"I'm gonna do--"

07:46.966 --> 07:47.900
Ryan.
- I don't know.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.435
Clean the garage out.

07:49.502 --> 07:51.103
- Yeah, like, he promised
his dad he was gonna do this.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.940
- Yeah, I just do it on my time.
- We were renovating a RV.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.409
He promised his dad
he would help him with that.

07:56.475 --> 07:57.777
He never did.

07:57.844 --> 07:59.245
- You graciously allow him
to live with you.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.246
- Mm-hmm.
- Don't you expect

08:00.313 --> 08:02.148
something in return?
- Yeah.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.382
{\an3}- Like cleaning
the garage, whatever?

08:03.449 --> 08:04.917
- Like, do--yeah,
do certain things, yeah.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.919
- How do you live your life
at your parents' house?

08:06.986 --> 08:08.054
I mean, how do you date and--

08:08.120 --> 08:09.422
- Oh, he doesn't anymore.

08:09.488 --> 08:10.690
- You don't anymore?
- No, he doesn't.

08:10.756 --> 08:12.491
- Is it better to be moved out?
- Oh, yeah.

08:12.558 --> 08:13.860
- [laughs]
- Better for you?

08:13.926 --> 08:15.127
{\an3}Better for you?
It's better for your family.

08:15.194 --> 08:16.462
Better for you?
- Yeah, it is.

08:16.529 --> 08:17.797
Well, it's better for him.

08:17.864 --> 08:19.332
I mean, he can do whatever--
- Right.

08:19.398 --> 08:22.134
- I mean, we don't have to know
what all he's doing.

08:22.201 --> 08:23.269
{\an3}- Ryan, something
that really confuses me is,

08:23.336 --> 08:25.504
{\an3}you know, you have
lots to offer,

08:25.571 --> 08:26.939
and you know I've--

08:27.006 --> 08:28.474
look at this one
nodding her head,

08:28.541 --> 08:30.509
{\an3}and even--you know I've always
felt that way about you.

08:30.576 --> 08:34.714
{\an3}That's why I gave you
so much grief over the years.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.082
Why aren't you working?

08:39.318 --> 08:40.653
- Why?

08:40.720 --> 08:41.988
- Don't you get bored?

08:42.054 --> 08:42.989
- That's what I say.
- All the time.

08:43.054 --> 08:44.190
Hey, where do you work?

08:44.256 --> 08:46.158
- I own a company.

08:47.994 --> 08:50.062
- Okay.
- Two of 'em.

08:50.129 --> 08:51.697
- Can you hire Ryan?

08:51.764 --> 08:53.733
[laughter]

08:53.799 --> 08:54.834
- I'm not gonna be a bum.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.068
{\an1}I'm not gonna live
on the streets.

08:56.135 --> 08:57.436
I promise you, I'll go to work.

08:57.503 --> 08:58.704
- Okay. Okay.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.506
- But from my point of view,
I feel like

09:00.573 --> 09:04.277
that you would feel better

09:04.343 --> 09:08.014
if you had, like,
a purpose every day, like--

09:08.080 --> 09:11.050
{\an3}- What kind of role model would
you like to be for Bentley?

09:11.117 --> 09:13.319
- I mean, I'd like to be
a great father for him.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.787
I'd like for him
to look up to me

09:14.854 --> 09:16.722
and, you know, appreciate and--

09:16.789 --> 09:18.090
- See that you're working hard?

09:18.157 --> 09:20.126
{\an1}- [laughs]
Sure.

09:20.192 --> 09:21.694
- I'm just sayin'.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.996
How's Ryan's attendance been
at baseball and whatnot?

09:24.063 --> 09:25.598
Been happier with that?

09:25.665 --> 09:28.634
- It's--it's all right
sometimes.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.636
I mean, I think
what hurts me the most

09:30.703 --> 09:34.540
is that I can't
give Bentley an answer.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.742
I can't--even if--

09:36.809 --> 09:38.744
even now if Ryan says,

09:38.811 --> 09:41.647
"Hey, I'm gonna come do this,"

09:41.714 --> 09:43.783
I don't tell Bentley,

09:43.849 --> 09:47.954
because I don't know
if Ryan's going to come,

09:48.020 --> 09:50.289
so I'm not going to get
Bentley's hopes up.

09:50.356 --> 09:52.458
{\an3}- Did--did your dad miss stuff
when you were growing up?

09:52.525 --> 09:55.962
{\an3}Did he ever make you feel
the way Bentley feels?

09:56.028 --> 09:57.563
- I wish my dad didn't come

09:57.630 --> 10:00.132
{\an1}to the things
like baseball and football.

10:00.199 --> 10:01.267
- Why?
- He was too intense.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.469
{\an1}- Because he was
on my ass all the time.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.004
- Oh, interesting.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.273
{\an3}Do you ride Bentley the way
your dad did you at all?

10:07.340 --> 10:08.674
- No.
- The opposite?

10:08.741 --> 10:11.544
- That's what Ryan
doesn't want to do.

10:11.610 --> 10:12.778
He does--he--

10:12.845 --> 10:15.247
I feel like he
might not want to come

10:15.314 --> 10:17.450
because he thinks
that's how he's gonna be.

10:17.516 --> 10:19.585
{\an1}- I mean, I don't come because
I don't want to get on him.

10:19.652 --> 10:21.787
I just didn't come because
I didn't want to interact

10:21.854 --> 10:23.456
with my father this year.

10:23.522 --> 10:24.924
- Yeah.
- Fair enough.

10:24.991 --> 10:27.126
And you have--you have
a new girlfriend, right?

10:27.193 --> 10:28.794
- Yeah.
- And that--how's that going?

10:28.861 --> 10:29.795
- Good.
- Good.

10:29.862 --> 10:30.930
And you're living with her,

10:30.997 --> 10:32.164
or she's living with you, or...?

10:32.231 --> 10:33.432
{\an1}- Mm-hmm.

10:33.499 --> 10:34.834
{\an3}- That happened
kind of fast, yeah?

10:34.900 --> 10:36.836
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, okay.

10:36.902 --> 10:39.105
All right, well, MacKenzie
has been backstage watching.

10:39.171 --> 10:40.139
Let's go ahead
and bring her out.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.173
MacKenzie?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.743
[applause]

10:43.809 --> 10:44.977
Hey, how are you?

10:45.044 --> 10:46.712
- Hey.
- How's it feel to be here?

10:46.779 --> 10:49.181
- I'm really nervous.
- Kind of weird, right?

10:49.248 --> 10:51.217
So how are you handling
this whole experience,

10:51.283 --> 10:52.952
being a part of a TV show?

10:53.019 --> 10:54.754
- Well, I said no to begin with.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.857
{\an1}No, no, no, no,
and hell, no,

10:57.923 --> 10:59.558
[laughter]

10:59.625 --> 11:02.094
And then it just
got really hard,

11:02.161 --> 11:03.696
you know, to--

11:03.763 --> 11:05.197
for him to film
and I was there,

11:05.264 --> 11:07.233
and then it was just crazy.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.802
- So you decided to do it?
- Okay, let's just do it.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.837
{\an3}- Do you know what he was
fighting with his dad about?

11:11.904 --> 11:13.806
{\an3}It wasn't clear to me
what that was.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.374
- I don't want to go there.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.576
{\an3}- Is there anything to have
been learned from that fight?

11:17.643 --> 11:19.979
- Either way, family is family,

11:20.046 --> 11:23.115
and whether you fight
or whether you don't,

11:23.182 --> 11:24.617
in the end when you have nobody,

11:24.683 --> 11:26.485
all you have is your family,

11:26.552 --> 11:29.455
{\an1}and, you know,
their relationship is fine now,

11:29.522 --> 11:31.724
{\an1}and he's always
gonna be his dad.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.559
- And how did he finally
figure out

11:33.626 --> 11:36.996
or find the resource
to go forward and make up?

11:37.063 --> 11:38.864
{\an1}- One day he just woke up
and was like,

11:38.931 --> 11:40.699
"I need to apologize to my dad."

11:40.766 --> 11:43.102
{\an3}- But in your head,
did you think to yourself,

11:43.169 --> 11:45.504
"I just got to be a--

11:45.571 --> 11:46.906
you know, bigger person here?"

11:46.972 --> 11:48.841
- Yeah, I mean,
I felt bad for Mom too,

11:48.908 --> 11:50.810
and I didn't want
to be mad at Dad.

11:52.678 --> 11:55.648
{\an3}- I--I see you having
real emotion here.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.750
It must have been
very hard for you.

11:57.817 --> 11:59.618
{\an3}I'm sorry.

12:01.087 --> 12:02.655
It's a--
- Stop it.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.023
- Is--is--
- [crying]

12:04.090 --> 12:07.626
{\an3}- Is the painful part mom
or dad or both?

12:07.693 --> 12:10.029
Both.
- Both.

12:10.096 --> 12:12.264
{\an3}- And you were dealing
with that--this all the time?

12:12.331 --> 12:13.532
- Yes.
- I'm so sorry, Ryan.

12:13.599 --> 12:14.967
I'm so sorry.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.902
{\an3}I'm getting emotional too,
just seeing the reaction

12:16.969 --> 12:18.771
you guys are having.

12:18.838 --> 12:20.706
- I told you--
- I know you didn't intend

12:20.773 --> 12:22.041
to have happen what happened,

12:22.108 --> 12:23.943
{\an3}and--give--
that's for Ryan.

12:24.009 --> 12:24.944

12:35.154 --> 12:36.388
{\an3}you know, that--
'cause--

12:36.455 --> 12:37.857
- I wish he could have
been here because--

12:37.923 --> 12:39.391
- Because it's--
Ryan was the one

12:39.458 --> 12:41.894
that stepped up and did this.
- Yeah.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.598
{\an3}- All five of us are crying.
This is--

12:45.664 --> 12:47.299

I imagine you guys are too.

mother-daughter relationships?

15:08.274 --> 15:09.208
{\an8}- Of course.
- Yes?

15:09.275 --> 15:10.843
{\an8}- Yeah.

15:10.909 --> 15:13.078
{\an8}So how'd you guys meet?
- On the Internet.

15:13.145 --> 15:15.247
{\an7}- This guy just went and turned
the whole script on you

15:15.314 --> 15:17.316
{\an7}to make it about me,
and now he's sitting here

15:17.383 --> 15:18.684
{\an8}just mind-[bleep] you

15:18.751 --> 15:20.919
{\an7}to where you're talking [bleep]
to me now.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.621
{\an7}Kudos to him.
Congratulations.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.156
{\an8}- To [bleep] care about you,

15:24.223 --> 15:25.691
{\an9}and you [bleep]
called me a liar,

15:25.758 --> 15:27.359
{\an9}and that's why
I'm [bleep] pissed.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.460
{\an8}- I did not.

15:28.527 --> 15:29.428
{\an8}- Get the [bleep] out
of my house.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.596
{\an8}- Farrah?

15:30.663 --> 15:32.264
{\an8}- You guys both need to learn

15:32.331 --> 15:33.532
{\an8}better communication skills.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.267
{\an8}- I'm aware, and I work on that.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.702
{\an9}- But I think you need
to work harder.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.736
{\an8}- Yes.

15:37.803 --> 15:39.772

I did the best I could.

15:45.944 --> 15:48.647
- That is some heavy stuff
between you and mom this year.

15:48.714 --> 15:49.982
{\an1}- Yeah.

15:50.049 --> 15:52.584
We understand
that we've been operating

15:52.651 --> 15:54.253
in a volatile relationship,

15:54.320 --> 15:57.323
and we really want to work on
understanding past traumas

15:57.389 --> 15:59.358
and, you know,
accepting those and moving on.

15:59.425 --> 16:01.560
- Is it hard to watch this?

16:01.627 --> 16:03.962
- I think it's great
to watch it.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.699
It's really a helpful tool
that I get to see myself

16:06.765 --> 16:07.866
and see my parents

16:07.933 --> 16:09.501
and figure out
where we want to move on

16:09.568 --> 16:11.303
and where we can go
in our therapy to better it.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.072
- It seemed like that last fight
with your mom

16:13.138 --> 16:15.841
was one of the more
intense one, right?

16:15.908 --> 16:18.110
- Yeah, I think some things of,

16:18.177 --> 16:21.513
like, lies and just
striking a nerve.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.416
- What was the nerve?
I didn't quite get it.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.919
- That nerve was more so about

16:26.985 --> 16:29.021
she's not admitting

16:29.088 --> 16:32.358
{\an1}that she's also been engaged
some other times, and I think--

16:32.424 --> 16:33.859
throughout my teen years

16:33.926 --> 16:35.627
{\an1}and calling me a liar,
and those things

16:35.694 --> 16:39.531
{\an1}just brought me
right back to 2008,

16:39.598 --> 16:41.967
and I yelled.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.902
I cried, and that's--

16:43.969 --> 16:46.171
{\an1}you know, that's what
that outburst was.

16:46.238 --> 16:47.740
- Somebody told me
that you were angry with me

16:47.806 --> 16:49.274
or that you were having trouble
coming out here.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.510
Did--something going on?

16:51.577 --> 16:53.379
- You did a radio interview.

16:53.445 --> 16:54.680
The comments you made--

16:54.747 --> 16:57.616
there was a joke
about choking someone

16:57.683 --> 17:01.286
and Farrah just needs attention
or is out for drama.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.654
Maybe it was a joke.

17:02.721 --> 17:04.156
Maybe it was--
I don't know what that was.

17:04.223 --> 17:07.025
I just don't think that was okay
for a doctor to do.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.395
I don't speak
to my other doctors

17:09.461 --> 17:11.329
like that, and, you know,
if they're frustrated,

17:11.396 --> 17:13.398
they probably keep it
to themselves.

17:13.464 --> 17:15.200
- You understand
I'm hosting a talk show?

17:15.267 --> 17:16.734
I'm not your doctor here.
- Okay.

17:16.801 --> 17:18.203
- Right?
- Well, then don't--

17:18.270 --> 17:20.372
don't try to take
that part, then, with me. Okay.

17:20.439 --> 17:21.607
- And we talk about
personal stuff,

17:21.673 --> 17:23.375
and I understand
where that gets confusing.

17:23.442 --> 17:24.843
- Okay, so I'll just
keep it limited.

17:24.910 --> 17:29.314
- And what I remember saying is

17:29.381 --> 17:31.750
I'm so frustrated
with some of your behavior,

17:31.817 --> 17:34.520
and if that hurt you in
some way, I apologize for that.

17:34.586 --> 17:35.521
- Thank you.

17:35.587 --> 17:36.922
- You know, I've talked to you,

17:36.989 --> 17:39.992
and I've seen the pain
that you carry around.

17:40.058 --> 17:41.560
- Yeah.
- And it's frustrating that

17:41.627 --> 17:43.796
{\an3}you have to do that
and you don't change that,

17:43.862 --> 17:46.965
{\an3}and all this sort of
fixed patterns stay in place.

17:47.032 --> 17:48.000
- Yes.
- Do you--

17:48.066 --> 17:49.701
{\an1}- So I have a lot more
to work on.

17:49.768 --> 17:52.237
{\an3}- And so when Sophia's around
some of these outbursts,

17:52.304 --> 17:53.806
{\an3}do you worry about that?
'Cause that's one of the persons

17:53.872 --> 17:55.741
{\an3}you're not thinking about
when you get consumed.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.211
{\an1}- Yes, and I basically,
you know, feel guilt by that.

17:59.278 --> 18:00.546
She does not deserve that,

18:00.612 --> 18:02.147
and, you know,

18:02.214 --> 18:04.082
currently right now
my mom and I

18:04.149 --> 18:06.752
and my dad and I

18:06.819 --> 18:09.288
are very much more separate

18:09.354 --> 18:11.490
until we really work out

18:11.557 --> 18:14.359
how we engage with each other

18:14.426 --> 18:15.861
so we're not continuing this.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.596
- It seems like you guys have
done a lot of work together,

18:17.663 --> 18:19.398
you and your mom and dad.
- Yup.

18:19.465 --> 18:23.068
{\an3}- Can you describe that to us,
where you're at with that?

18:23.135 --> 18:24.970
- I mean, I can only say
I'm at the beginning.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.205
It's how it feels,

18:26.271 --> 18:28.674
even though I've been
going to therapy

18:28.740 --> 18:30.442
off and on for, like,

18:30.509 --> 18:32.311
I don't know, seven years?

18:32.377 --> 18:36.281
And that's sad that I haven't
made much progress in that time.

18:36.348 --> 18:37.816
- It--
- I mean, I'm getting somewhere.

18:37.883 --> 18:39.952
I'm actually feeling like
I'm getting somewhere now,

18:40.018 --> 18:43.188
{\an1}and it's ju--I mean,
I need to make more time.

18:43.255 --> 18:45.891
{\an1}I have to, like, physically make
sure I'm doing this weekly now

18:45.958 --> 18:47.960
{\an1}to further me along
where I want.

18:48.026 --> 18:49.428
- By yours--you do it weekly?

18:49.495 --> 18:51.196
{\an1}- With myself, and I also
have to, you know,

18:51.263 --> 18:53.465
{\an1}incorporate my parents at least,
like, every other week.

18:53.532 --> 18:54.867
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

18:54.933 --> 18:57.169
- Does--does television
adversely impact that?

18:57.236 --> 18:58.537
{\an3}I mean, I--

18:58.604 --> 19:01.940
{\an1}- I think television
has helped me better myself.

19:02.007 --> 19:02.975
- Okay, okay.

19:03.041 --> 19:04.142
{\an1}- And I would always
use television

19:04.209 --> 19:05.677
{\an1}as a positive tool
rather than a negative.

19:05.744 --> 19:07.246
- And I want to congratulate you

19:07.312 --> 19:08.914
on all the businesses and stuff.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.616
- That's remarkable.
- I'm very excited about that.

19:10.682 --> 19:11.917
{\an3}- I mean, yeah,
it's pretty remarkable.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.919
- I'm happy it's working out.
- Yeah.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.154
Let's talk about the businesses.

19:16.221 --> 19:17.856
I was thinking about
your furniture store.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.424
{\an3}How did you decide
on a furniture store?

19:19.491 --> 19:20.759
{\an3}How did you decide
to do that?

19:20.826 --> 19:23.328
- I'm very passionate about that

19:23.395 --> 19:26.932
{\an1}from doing real estate
and staging,

19:26.999 --> 19:28.634
{\an1}and then a bunch
of my friends also--

19:28.700 --> 19:30.302
{\an1}like Simon,
who you see in the show,

19:30.369 --> 19:32.571
{\an1}he also has a large
staging company,

19:32.638 --> 19:35.140
{\an1}and I start--I just get to go
to these markets,

19:35.207 --> 19:36.775
and I start really loving,

19:36.842 --> 19:39.111
for my designer friends
and interior decorators,

19:39.177 --> 19:41.046
{\an1}that it all kind of fit
for the community,

19:41.113 --> 19:43.448
{\an1}and it's made
a good impact thus far,

19:43.515 --> 19:44.650
so I'm happy it was a fit.
- It's open?

19:44.716 --> 19:46.018
- Yes.
- It's--how's it doing?

19:46.084 --> 19:48.854
{\an1}- It's doing great,
and I love every moment of it.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.689
{\an3}- So Sophia, we see her
a lot this season

19:50.756 --> 19:51.990
hanging out with Derek's family.

19:52.057 --> 19:54.226
Why is that important to you?

19:54.293 --> 19:56.495
{\an1}- I don't know.
It gives me closure.

19:56.562 --> 19:58.897
It makes me happy
as a mother for my daughter

19:58.964 --> 20:00.465
who doesn't have her dad

20:00.532 --> 20:03.368
that she can have a great,

20:03.435 --> 20:05.504
supportive, you know,

20:05.571 --> 20:09.875
experience with her dad's dad
and grandma and cousins,

20:09.942 --> 20:12.377
and that's a beautiful thing.

20:12.444 --> 20:16.081
- How big a role is Debra
in Sophia's life?

20:16.148 --> 20:18.750
- I would say my mom

20:18.817 --> 20:20.919
as a grandma to Sophia
is a very big role.

20:20.986 --> 20:24.089
{\an1}That's--you know,
I try to make that, like,

20:24.156 --> 20:26.325
a--hopefully, like, a 50% role,

20:26.391 --> 20:28.327
{\an1}and then sometimes
that's just not possible.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.928
- I think the good
side effect of that

20:29.995 --> 20:32.898
{\an3}is that it motivates you
to work on that relationship.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.067
- Of course.
- So you're not mistreating her.

20:35.133 --> 20:37.436
- Yeah.
- You mistreat her.

20:37.502 --> 20:38.604
- Okay.

20:39.671 --> 20:41.573
- Come on, now.
- I mean, I--

20:41.640 --> 20:43.241
{\an3}- I'm not saying
she doesn't mistreat you,

20:43.308 --> 20:44.676
but I'm saying you mistreat her.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.912
{\an1}- I directly, you know, deal
with those things with my mom,

20:46.979 --> 20:48.747
and we talk about
those things together, so...

20:48.814 --> 20:50.082
- Okay.
- We definitely have love,

20:50.148 --> 20:51.583
and we're working on it.

20:51.650 --> 20:52.784

{\an3}What are your thoughts
on this season for Farrah?

21:26.051 --> 21:29.388
- It's a phenomenal season.

21:29.454 --> 21:32.090
{\an1}Her business ventures
were a challenge for all of us,

I'm very proud of her.

{\an3}- Debra, you know,
I can't escape the fact that--

21:37.195 --> 21:38.430
{\an3}and I'm sure people
are thinking,

21:38.497 --> 21:39.898
{\an3}so I got to bring it up.
You look so different.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.234
{\an3}You look beautiful,
but what's happening here?

21:42.300 --> 21:45.270
- My fiancé said to me
one day in passing,

21:45.337 --> 21:47.439
"You know, I really
like Farrah's hair.

21:47.506 --> 21:50.542
Do you ever consider
changing your hair color?"

21:50.609 --> 21:53.612
And so today we were walking by
a wig shop, and I'm like,

21:53.679 --> 21:55.714
"Wow, let's go to pick out
the hair,"

21:55.781 --> 21:58.750
so anyway, I thought
I'd try out the hair.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.152
What do you guys
think of the color?

22:00.218 --> 22:01.253
- It's fun.
It looks good.

22:01.319 --> 22:02.921
- Yeah?
Awesome.

22:02.988 --> 22:06.491
{\an3}- Uh, Farrah seems to get
terribly angry

22:06.558 --> 22:07.926
when you have a new boyfriend.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.394
{\an3}That seems to be
a trigger for her.

22:09.461 --> 22:12.664
{\an3}She's anxious that this one
evolved so quickly,

22:12.731 --> 22:15.367
{\an3}and so do you understand
why she'd be upset about that?

22:15.434 --> 22:16.702
- Of course I do.
- Okay.

22:16.768 --> 22:20.038
- Absolutely, yup.
- Why do you think?

22:20.105 --> 22:23.075
- Well, she might think

22:23.141 --> 22:25.677
that it evolved too quickly,

22:25.744 --> 22:28.346
but right here, right now

22:28.413 --> 22:31.483
I will tell you
that the person I am dating

22:31.550 --> 22:34.419
has a very similar
background to yours.

22:34.486 --> 22:37.389
He's awesome, and he's real,

22:37.456 --> 22:38.824
so I'm okay with him.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.426
- Do you want to
express yourself on this, or...?

22:41.493 --> 22:45.297
- I mean, I don't really
feel like having a conversation

22:45.363 --> 22:48.867
about who she's engaged
with, so...

22:48.934 --> 22:50.502
{\an3}- Do you like
the current fiancé?

22:50.569 --> 22:52.537
- I think that that's great
that she's found somebody

22:52.604 --> 22:55.674

- Mm-hmm.

22:55.741 --> 22:56.908

22:56.975 --> 22:58.343
- Bottom line is this.
- Bottom line.

22:58.410 --> 23:00.679
{\an1}- To--to know Farrah
is to love Farrah,

23:00.746 --> 23:03.248
{\an1}and I don't think
that gentleman's really had time

23:03.315 --> 23:05.283
to really know Farrah,

23:05.350 --> 23:07.018
{\an1}to have some
of the discussions

23:07.085 --> 23:08.787
{\an1}that I've heard
that he's had with her.

23:08.854 --> 23:12.557
{\an3}- Oh. Can you give me
an example?

23:12.624 --> 23:14.159
- Well, he wasn't there,
so he can't give a comment.

23:14.226 --> 23:17.295
{\an1}- I wasn't there,
but I've heard some things,

23:17.362 --> 23:21.299
and I think maybe the discussion

23:21.366 --> 23:22.934
came across maybe judgmental.

23:23.001 --> 23:25.470
- What did--what did you
experience?

23:25.537 --> 23:28.573
- I am getting to know someone.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.876
I am having a great dinner.

23:30.942 --> 23:33.078
Then at the end of dessert,

23:33.145 --> 23:35.647
the end of dinner,
like, it went,

23:35.714 --> 23:38.350
"Well, do you want me
to get real?

23:38.416 --> 23:40.051
I'll really let you know
how I really feel."

23:40.118 --> 23:41.620
Like, when someone
approaches me like...

23:41.686 --> 23:43.789
- No, it wasn't like that.
- "You want me to be real?"

23:43.855 --> 23:44.890
Those are the words.

23:44.956 --> 23:46.224
- The producer asked us
to carry--

23:46.291 --> 23:47.793
- Those are the words.
He did--no one asked.

23:47.859 --> 23:49.461
- To cover another subject,

23:49.528 --> 23:50.862
so he was just
trying to do that.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.397
- No, we were saying bye,

23:52.464 --> 23:53.932
and he wanted to get real,
really real.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.100
- And Heather came in and said,

23:55.167 --> 23:56.501
"We need to cover
such-and-such."

23:56.568 --> 23:58.203
- So apparently
he wasn't being real with me

23:58.270 --> 23:59.638
the whole time at dinner.

23:59.704 --> 24:02.407
He must have thought I was fake
bull[bleep] at dinner.

24:02.474 --> 24:03.909
- No, he didn't.
- So...

24:03.975 --> 24:05.977
- He did not.
- We had to get really real.

24:06.044 --> 24:10.015
And it was really not needed
to me, and it was more so,

24:10.081 --> 24:12.317
"Let me tell you
how I feel about you.

24:12.384 --> 24:14.152
This is the conversations
that your mom have."

24:14.219 --> 24:15.654
I love--I love his take

24:15.720 --> 24:18.056
on my relationship
with my mom growing up.

24:18.123 --> 24:22.127
I love his take on what he sees
from watching the show

24:22.194 --> 24:25.931
and how he can also help
give me dating advice.

24:25.997 --> 24:27.866
I love it all,
but I don't need it.

24:27.933 --> 24:29.835
{\an3}- [laughs]

24:29.901 --> 24:30.969
- That's how I feel.
- Okay.

24:31.036 --> 24:32.504
- He should work on that
with you.

24:32.571 --> 24:34.039
{\an3}- Now, you guys have been
working a lot together, right?

24:34.105 --> 24:35.040
- Mm-hmm.

24:35.106 --> 24:36.641
- As a family?
- Yes.

24:36.708 --> 24:40.345
{\an3}- And Farrah's working very hard
on trying not to trigger,

24:40.412 --> 24:43.248
{\an3}and Farrah, you get upset when
your mom has a relationship.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.083
Do you feel the need to control?

24:45.150 --> 24:47.853
- It's not really about my mom
having a relationship

24:47.919 --> 24:49.254
that triggers me.
- Yeah?

24:49.321 --> 24:52.290
- It's more so what I--

24:52.357 --> 24:53.758
what we've been working on

24:53.825 --> 24:55.994
isn't really matching
with what she's doing,

24:56.061 --> 24:58.563
and that is hurtful to me.

24:58.630 --> 25:00.398
{\an3}- Debra, that terrible fight
we just saw

25:00.465 --> 25:02.701
{\an3}where you were sent to your room
almost like a child, right?

25:02.767 --> 25:04.269
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, does Farrah treat you

25:04.336 --> 25:06.972
like the mom sometimes?

25:07.038 --> 25:08.807
- Parenting your parents.

25:08.874 --> 25:10.175
- Is that what she's doing?

25:10.242 --> 25:13.745
- One person cannot dominate
the conversation.

25:13.812 --> 25:15.113
{\an3}- Okay.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.883
- One person cannot dictate,
"This is my wish.

25:17.949 --> 25:19.885
"By God, this is the way
it's going to be,

25:19.951 --> 25:22.020
or you're out
of my life forever."

25:22.087 --> 25:24.656
- Is that the kind
of conversation that I want?

25:24.723 --> 25:26.524
- No, and that's not
what I'm saying.

25:26.591 --> 25:28.059
- Okay.
- I'm trying to say--

25:28.126 --> 25:30.061
{\an3}- No, no, but--
but the point she's--

25:30.128 --> 25:31.796
that's an olive branch.
- Yeah.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.765
{\an3}- She's saying,
"I don't want to be like that."

25:33.832 --> 25:34.766
- Correct.
- Yeah.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.034
She doesn't like it either.

25:36.101 --> 25:37.469
- And nobody wants that.
- But when that happens,

25:37.535 --> 25:39.838
it's not fun or happy for her.

25:39.905 --> 25:41.339
- I understand that,
but all I'm--

25:41.406 --> 25:43.341
{\an3}- I get that you get
the worst end of the deal, but--

25:43.408 --> 25:45.377
- No, all I'm trying to say is,

25:45.443 --> 25:47.979
I just would like
no screaming and yelling,

25:48.046 --> 25:49.748
just a nice little conversation

25:49.814 --> 25:51.283
so we hear each other.
- So would I.

25:51.349 --> 25:52.617
- That's all I'm trying to say.

25:52.684 --> 25:54.519
- So would I.
- I'm gonna switch gears.

25:54.586 --> 25:56.321
Debra, how do you feel
about Simon?

25:56.388 --> 25:57.822
- I don't know how to feel
about Simon.

25:57.889 --> 26:00.425
- Wh--and I--
- I tell him I forgive him.

26:00.492 --> 26:02.961
I tell him that he needs
to make his mind up.

26:03.028 --> 26:05.297
- For what?
Forgive him--forgive him for?

26:05.363 --> 26:08.733
- Well, he does
some pretty weird things

26:08.800 --> 26:11.202
that I don't understand
to my daughter, so...

26:11.269 --> 26:14.139
- So things that hurt Farrah?
- Yeah.

26:14.205 --> 26:16.708
- And why forgive him?

26:16.775 --> 26:19.044
- Well, I see that
he tries to make amends.

26:19.110 --> 26:20.312
I do see that.

26:20.378 --> 26:21.780
- If I'm getting it right,
Farrah,

26:21.846 --> 26:23.081
you've pulled back
from the relationship, right?

26:23.148 --> 26:24.149
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:24.215 --> 26:25.817
Is that--you're good with that?

26:25.884 --> 26:27.419
- I'm good with that.
- Yeah?

26:27.485 --> 26:29.054
Michael?
- Yeah, I'm good with that.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.589
I think it was
a very strong choice

26:31.656 --> 26:34.259
for Farrah to make
and for Simon to accept.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.227
- The choice being?

26:36.294 --> 26:37.295
- Them separating.
- Yeah.

26:37.362 --> 26:40.031
- But the bottom line is,

26:40.098 --> 26:41.933
we may be able
to be salvaged.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.402
We have to salvage Sophia.

26:44.469 --> 26:46.905
We can't let her fall into this,

26:46.972 --> 26:48.139
and Simon saw that,

26:48.206 --> 26:50.442
{\an1}and so did Farrah,
and they took action.

26:50.508 --> 26:52.644
- Debra, do you feel
as motivated as those two

26:52.711 --> 26:54.779
as it pertains
to Sophia's well-being?

26:54.846 --> 26:56.414
- I'm way far motivated.

26:56.481 --> 26:57.916
That's my number one goal.

26:57.983 --> 26:59.918
{\an3}- 'Cause one of the things
Farrah and I did share

26:59.985 --> 27:03.054
{\an3}was how important you--
you are to Sophia.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.222
That relationship seems very--

27:04.289 --> 27:05.323
- And how important
she is to me.

27:05.390 --> 27:06.524
{\an3}- I'm sure.

27:06.591 --> 27:07.892
Well, thank you, Debra, Michael.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.227
{\an3}I'm gonna say goodbye
to you guys,

27:09.294 --> 27:10.929
{\an3}but I'm gonna bring Simon
out here,

27:10.996 --> 27:12.197
who will be up here next.

27:12.263 --> 27:15.200
{\an8}[applause]

27:15.266 --> 27:19.270
{\an8}<i>♪ ♪</i>

27:23.541 --> 27:25.143
{\an8}<i>[upbeat music]</i>

27:25.210 --> 27:26.644
{\an8}- Dissolve two.
Nice and slow, one.

27:26.711 --> 27:28.346
{\an8}Dissolve one, push.

27:28.413 --> 27:29.848
{\an8}[applause]

27:29.914 --> 27:30.915
- I'm here now with Farrah

27:30.982 --> 27:32.984
and, for the first time, Simon.

27:33.051 --> 27:35.120
{\an3}Thanks, Simon, for coming in.
I appreciate it.

27:35.186 --> 27:37.022
- I think the ladies love this.

27:37.088 --> 27:38.590
- What--give me an update.

27:38.656 --> 27:40.892
Where do you guys stand
from your perspective?

27:40.959 --> 27:42.327
- Right now we're--
- We're friends.

27:42.394 --> 27:43.895
- Yeah, we're friends right now.

27:43.962 --> 27:45.196
- [chuckles]

27:45.263 --> 27:46.197
- How old are you?

27:46.264 --> 27:48.299
- 27.
- 27.

27:48.366 --> 27:49.934
- You remember those ages,
Dr. Drew?

27:50.001 --> 27:55.340
- I do, and I was
thinking about...

27:55.407 --> 27:57.675
{\an3}some of the things
you were asking from Simon,

27:57.742 --> 28:00.879
{\an3}and I was wondering if it was
just his age as much as anything

28:00.945 --> 28:02.814
{\an3}and not really how he feels
about you but just...

28:02.881 --> 28:03.982
- Yeah.

28:04.049 --> 28:05.316
{\an3}- Not ready for those
kinds of things.

28:05.383 --> 28:06.451
- Mm-hmm.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.019
- Yeah, that too, but, you know,

28:08.086 --> 28:09.587
{\an1}you know when the time's right,
you know what I mean?

28:09.654 --> 28:11.890
{\an1}You can't just kind of jump
into stuff, you know? I mean--

28:11.956 --> 28:13.458
- Time is right?
- Time, yeah.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.794
{\an3}- Yeah, see, I know that's how
young men think, so...

28:15.860 --> 28:17.362
Their timing has to be right.

28:17.429 --> 28:18.930
- Yeah, mine too.
- I understand.

28:18.997 --> 28:21.299
{\an3}But I'm just saying,
I had not had the chance to

28:21.366 --> 28:23.701
ask him that question yet, so...
- Yeah, yeah.

28:23.768 --> 28:26.638
- And that--you went as far

28:26.704 --> 28:28.773
as getting involved
with ring purchasing

28:28.840 --> 28:30.508
{\an3}or almost ring purchasing.
What the hell?

28:30.575 --> 28:32.010
- Do you remember
that today, or...?

28:32.077 --> 28:34.312
{\an1}- It's--okay, so here's how
the real story is.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.780
- Okay.
- Since people want to hear it.

28:35.847 --> 28:37.315
So she was--
- Give me the real--

28:37.382 --> 28:38.550
the whole thing.
- The real story.

28:38.616 --> 28:40.218
- The real story.
- All right, so she was

28:40.285 --> 28:42.220
at a trip at the Bahamas, okay?

28:42.287 --> 28:44.389
She calls me at 3:00 a.m., okay?

28:44.456 --> 28:46.858
{\an1}She's like, "Hey,
Sophia and I found this ring.

28:46.925 --> 28:47.992
We want this ring."

28:48.059 --> 28:49.060
- This was a different time
for us.

28:49.127 --> 28:50.228
We're in different time zones.

28:50.295 --> 28:51.563
{\an1}- So she's like,
"We want this ring.

28:51.629 --> 28:52.497
{\an1}It's $64,000."
I'm like, "Whoa, don't.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.865
Wait, don't buy this thing."

28:53.932 --> 28:55.700
{\an1}"We really want it.
This is the one we want."

28:55.767 --> 28:56.968
{\an1}The worst thing you guys
ever want to do

28:57.035 --> 28:59.304
is go on a cruise ship
and buy jewelry there.

28:59.370 --> 29:00.772
That's not what you do.

29:00.839 --> 29:02.640
{\an1}And me, I like to get deals
on everything I do.

29:02.707 --> 29:04.209
{\an1}That's what I do
for a living, you know?

29:04.275 --> 29:06.478
- You cut the ring cost in half.
That was the deal.

29:06.544 --> 29:07.812
{\an1}- Thank you.
You're welcome.

29:07.879 --> 29:09.214
She was gonna pay $64,000 for--

29:09.280 --> 29:10.648
- Yes, I'm welcome,
because I bought it.

29:10.715 --> 29:11.983
- She would have--
- I'm welcome.

29:12.050 --> 29:14.052
{\an1}- She would have paid $64,000
for this ring.

29:14.119 --> 29:16.521
{\an1}Luckily, I got it to her
for 30 out the door.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.622
- And you--and did you--

29:17.689 --> 29:18.790
- And then what
do we do with it,

29:18.857 --> 29:20.225
30 out the door?
- You wanted the ring.

29:20.291 --> 29:21.793
- We just get to keep it
and talk about it.

29:21.860 --> 29:23.528
{\an1}- I just--I didn't know what
she wanted to do with the ring.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.796
I just got her a deal.

29:24.863 --> 29:25.997
{\an1}I didn't want to see her
lose money.

29:26.064 --> 29:27.565
- Did you buy it?
- Huh?

29:27.632 --> 29:28.600
- Did you buy it?
- No.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.068
- No.
- But you said you were.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.503
- I never said that.

29:31.569 --> 29:32.837
{\an3}- It seems like there was
a huge miscommunication

29:32.904 --> 29:33.838
of this ring purchase.

29:33.905 --> 29:36.007
- Yeah, so who really knows?

29:36.074 --> 29:39.511
You know, when he talks
about marriage and engagements

29:39.577 --> 29:43.114
and kids, then who really knows
if you're--what are we

29:43.181 --> 29:44.582
even talking about?
- I've never brought that up.

29:44.649 --> 29:46.451
{\an1}It's brought up to me
all the time.

29:46.518 --> 29:49.320
I'm like--
- Let me--let me--let me help--

29:49.387 --> 29:50.989
{\an3}if you were gonna
get married to somebody,

29:51.055 --> 29:52.290
get engaged to somebody,

29:52.357 --> 29:53.925
{\an3}you would make
a formal proposal?

29:53.992 --> 29:55.593
- I'd have a elephant come out.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.028
{\an3}- You wouldn't be--
he wouldn't be--

29:57.095 --> 29:58.363
- And I would be just--
I would have a parade.

29:58.429 --> 30:01.065
{\an3}- Are--you know, you got to
get clearer with her

30:01.132 --> 30:02.834
{\an3}about you and marriage.
You're not ready for marriage.

30:02.901 --> 30:04.102
- Oh, no, it's--
- Well, we're friends right now,

30:04.169 --> 30:05.436
{\an1}so that conversation's
out the door.

30:05.503 --> 30:06.538
{\an3}- I know, but you're
not ready for marriage.

30:06.604 --> 30:07.672
You got to say those words.

30:07.739 --> 30:08.706
- Yes, Simon should
just admit that.

30:08.773 --> 30:10.008
- Yeah, you--
- Exactly, yeah.

30:10.074 --> 30:11.442
- I think I mistook--
- He never proposed.

30:11.509 --> 30:12.977
- I think I mistook
our conversations.

30:13.044 --> 30:14.279
- He never proposed.
- No, he did not propose.

30:14.345 --> 30:15.613
{\an1}- I think it
was miscommunication,

30:15.680 --> 30:16.915
is what it was.
- So you got to be--and you're--

30:16.981 --> 30:18.650
{\an3}I'm just experiencing it
as I talk to you.

30:18.716 --> 30:20.885
- Yeah.
- And maybe it's only being

30:20.952 --> 30:22.287
on a one-on-one setting.

30:22.353 --> 30:23.588
{\an1}- Sure.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.523
- You are hard
to follow sometimes,

30:25.590 --> 30:26.991
and I can see
how she can get confused.

30:27.058 --> 30:28.193
{\an1}- Yeah.

30:28.259 --> 30:29.594
{\an3}- 'Cause you talk sideways,
kind of.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.162
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah.
- So you got to be--

30:31.229 --> 30:32.764
{\an3}if you're not ready
to get married, you got to say,

30:32.830 --> 30:34.165
{\an3}"I'm not ready to marry.
I'll let you know when I am."

30:34.232 --> 30:35.400
- Yeah.
- Yup.

30:35.466 --> 30:36.501
{\an3}- And she needs
that kind of clarity,

30:36.568 --> 30:37.435
{\an3}or she goes into
this fantasy mode.

30:37.502 --> 30:38.469
- Very true, yeah.

30:38.536 --> 30:40.071
- So do you want to marry Simon?

30:40.138 --> 30:41.072
- No.

30:41.139 --> 30:42.507
[laughter]

30:42.574 --> 30:43.975
- I think that there's--

30:44.042 --> 30:45.510
there's more affection
between you

30:45.577 --> 30:49.080
than either of you
are willing to admit, but okay.

30:49.147 --> 30:51.316
It seems like, Simon,
you do stuff sometimes

30:51.382 --> 30:54.085
that almost looks intentional

30:54.152 --> 30:56.154
{\an3}that you're trying to get
Farrah escalated.

30:56.221 --> 30:57.288
Triggered.
- [stammering]

30:57.355 --> 30:58.690
- Yeah, he does.
- Triggered, triggered.

30:58.756 --> 31:01.025
{\an1}Yeah, no, I'm not, really.
Well, women are--not--

31:01.092 --> 31:02.460
{\an1}no offense, but there's--
some women are--

31:02.527 --> 31:04.095
- Because you're not
interacting appropriately

31:04.162 --> 31:05.396
with someone who you're dating.
- 'Cause they're like--

31:05.463 --> 31:06.531
{\an1}they want you to talk too much
about your feelings

31:06.598 --> 31:07.732
and stuff like that, you know?

31:07.799 --> 31:09.968
{\an1}Which--it's just like,
you know, as guys,

31:10.034 --> 31:12.370
{\an1}we just--that's just not
our second nature, you know?

31:12.437 --> 31:13.972
- Simon, you talk
about your feelings

31:14.038 --> 31:15.974
more than I even ask about
your feelings.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.776
- [laughing]

31:18.843 --> 31:20.878
- Yeah, no.
- Yeah, women these days.

31:20.945 --> 31:22.480
Women.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.982
- I can't help but bring up--

31:24.048 --> 31:25.750
{\an3}I was thinking about these
Snapchats you've been doing.

31:25.817 --> 31:26.985
I keep hearing that they're--

31:27.051 --> 31:28.286
{\an3}I don't know.
I haven't seen them.

31:28.353 --> 31:29.787
{\an1}- You know, the thing is,
is I think these people

31:29.854 --> 31:31.189
{\an1}make themselves,
you know, vulnerable.

31:31.256 --> 31:33.057
{\an1}It's like they just, like,
you know, give you ammo

31:33.124 --> 31:34.525
to just talk about them,

31:34.592 --> 31:35.760
which is kind of funny.

31:35.827 --> 31:37.128
{\an1}I mean, a lot of things
that go on,

31:37.195 --> 31:38.429
and I don't mean no disrespect,

31:38.496 --> 31:39.831
{\an1}and some people
got hurt about it,

31:39.897 --> 31:41.332
but it was all in fun.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.768
- So you're, like, a troll?

31:43.835 --> 31:45.703
- He's not being an Amber

31:45.770 --> 31:48.206
or being a Maci
or being a Catelynn,

31:48.273 --> 31:51.109
and saying you're gonna
beat somebody's ass,

31:51.175 --> 31:52.510
you're gonna create fights--

31:52.577 --> 31:54.646
like, Simon's not even
doing that.

31:54.712 --> 31:56.281
- I heard--
- So I think it's one thing--

31:56.347 --> 31:58.216
{\an3}- Well, I heard you
called somebody a pedophile.

31:58.283 --> 31:59.517
- Well, I'm sorry that Matt
probably looks like it.

31:59.584 --> 32:00.952
- Probably all in fun.
- In fun?

32:01.019 --> 32:03.288
{\an3}- I would--that--
I wouldn't take that as fun

32:03.354 --> 32:04.656
if I were the object of that.

32:04.722 --> 32:05.957
{\an1}- Well, yeah, you got to have
a sense of humor, then.

32:06.024 --> 32:07.458
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

32:07.525 --> 32:09.093
- They act like they have
a sense of humor. Maybe not.

32:09.160 --> 32:12.964
- And so why--and you're saying
somebody threatened somebody?

32:13.031 --> 32:14.699
One of the other--
- I mean, over the--

32:14.766 --> 32:18.403
like, over the extension
of trying to have a relationship

32:18.469 --> 32:20.505
with somebody
who I do a show with

32:20.571 --> 32:22.073
and I share a commonality

32:22.140 --> 32:24.008
through the years.
It just continue--

32:24.075 --> 32:25.677
{\an1}- No, [bleep]
that [bleep] bitch.

32:25.743 --> 32:27.045
- Uh-oh.
- [bleep] that bitch.

32:27.111 --> 32:29.280
Say that [bleep].
- So this is the example...

32:29.347 --> 32:30.948
- Say that [bleep], bitch.
Listen to me right now.

32:31.015 --> 32:32.083
- Of what I deal with.
- Amber, Amber, Amber.

32:32.150 --> 32:33.518
- This is the example.
- Amber.

32:33.584 --> 32:35.053
{\an1}- Just because somebody's
20 years older than you

32:35.119 --> 32:36.421
{\an1}doesn't mean
he's a [bleep] pedophile.

32:36.487 --> 32:38.222
- Hi, Amber. Hi, Amber.
- Shut your [bleep] mouth.

32:38.289 --> 32:39.390
- Hi, Amber.
- Shut your [bleep] mouth,

32:39.457 --> 32:40.625
do you understand me?
- Hi, Amber.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.060
- Amber, Amber.
- Shut your [bleep] mouth.

32:42.126 --> 32:43.161
- Amber.
- Get the [bleep] off me.

32:43.227 --> 32:44.262
Don't put your [bleep]--

32:44.329 --> 32:45.430
[all shouting at once]

32:45.496 --> 32:47.098
Don't put your [bleep]--

32:47.165 --> 32:49.400
{\an1}I'm gonna stand up for my
[bleep] man 'cause he's a bet--

32:49.467 --> 32:50.968
{\an1}- Yeah, you should!
You should.

32:51.035 --> 32:52.403
{\an3}- Bitch, you talk a lot of
[bleep] when people are around.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.871
- Don't make it worse.
Don't make it worse.

32:53.938 --> 32:55.206
{\an3}- You talk a lot of [bleep]
when people are around,

32:55.273 --> 32:56.708
don't you, [bleep]?
- No, no, no, guys.

32:56.774 --> 32:58.009
- Don't make it worse.
- Watch your [bleep] mouth.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.243
- I'm right here.
- Watch it.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.845
And I'm right [bleep] here!

33:00.912 --> 33:01.846
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- [bleep], bitch!

33:01.913 --> 33:03.214
And I'm right [bleep] here!

33:03.281 --> 33:04.882
- Please, please, please.
- Watch your mouth!

33:04.949 --> 33:06.384
- Please. Can somebody please
take Farrah off stage?

33:06.451 --> 33:07.618
- Watch your [bleep] mouth!
- Farrah, Farrah.

33:07.685 --> 33:08.953
- And this is why--

33:09.020 --> 33:10.621
- Don't call my [bleep] man
a pedophile!

33:10.688 --> 33:11.789
- And this is why
I don't associate--

33:11.856 --> 33:13.091
- Hey, Michael,
do not get into that.

33:13.157 --> 33:14.859
- You guys, absolutely not.
No, no, no, no!

33:14.926 --> 33:16.627
No, no, no, guys!
- Come on!

33:16.694 --> 33:18.062
- Those two, those two,
those two.

33:18.129 --> 33:19.197
- Hey!
- Hey, hey!

33:19.263 --> 33:20.465
- Hey, let's not get into this.

33:20.531 --> 33:22.633
- Are you guys kidding me?

33:22.700 --> 33:24.369
This is [bleep] ridiculous.

33:24.435 --> 33:25.770
- [bleep].
- Security.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.905
- They got it.
- [bleep], [bleep].

33:27.972 --> 33:29.874
[people speaking indistinctly]

33:29.941 --> 33:31.376
- Get 'em out of here.

33:31.442 --> 33:33.911
- Don't [bleep] speak of me
again, you understand?

33:33.978 --> 33:35.947
- One, two, three.
- Don't ever speak of me again!

33:36.013 --> 33:37.081
- Hold on.
- Do something.

33:37.148 --> 33:38.282
- Look, please go back.
- Do something.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.051
{\an1}- No, both of the criminals
will do [bleep].

33:40.118 --> 33:41.486
Both of the criminals!
- Yeah, that's right!

33:41.552 --> 33:42.787
I'm a [bleep] felon,

33:42.854 --> 33:44.489
but I say [bleep]
to your [bleep] face!

33:44.555 --> 33:46.457
- I do too!
- Bitch, do it then!

33:46.524 --> 33:48.126
- I already have!
- Do it then, [bleep]!

33:48.192 --> 33:49.260
- Bye!
- Do it then!

33:49.327 --> 33:50.495
- Bye!
- Come on. Amber, come on.

33:50.561 --> 33:51.629
- I didn't hit him.
- Come on. Go.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.231
- Take a deep breath.
- [bleep].

33:53.297 --> 33:55.366
- Michael, do you want to call
the police on the criminals?

33:55.433 --> 33:56.601
{\an1}- [bleep].

33:56.667 --> 33:58.403
- 'Cause they need to go
visit jail.

33:58.469 --> 33:59.837
- Remember, they're safe
inside here.

33:59.904 --> 34:01.305
- That's [bleep] right!
- That's the difference.

34:01.372 --> 34:04.509
- And look at me now!
- [bleep] you, you [bleep].

34:06.477 --> 34:08.679
- [bleep] bitch.
- Oh, this is--

34:08.746 --> 34:11.349
- That's why you've been hiding
all [bleep] day from us!

34:11.416 --> 34:12.483
- Prime example.

34:12.550 --> 34:13.650
- [bleep]-ass bitch.
- Good job.

34:13.717 --> 34:15.253
- Thank you
for the example, Amber.

34:15.319 --> 34:16.420
- Shut the [bleep] up.

34:16.487 --> 34:19.056
[laughter]

34:19.123 --> 34:22.260
- Dude, this is so--
- Trashy bitch!

34:22.326 --> 34:23.860
Trashy bitch!

34:25.463 --> 34:27.297
- That's called a woman, bitch.

34:27.364 --> 34:28.632
- Okay.
- You're not!

34:28.699 --> 34:31.202
- That's called
a real [bleep] woman, bitch!

34:31.268 --> 34:33.538
{\an8}- Shh. Shh.
- A real [bleep] woman!

34:33.603 --> 34:35.273
{\an8}<i>Shut your [bleep]</i>
<i>crooked lips up!</i>

34:35.339 --> 34:37.007
{\an8}<i>[people speaking indistinctly]</i>

34:40.043 --> 34:42.980
{\an8}<i>[upbeat music]</i>

34:43.047 --> 34:45.248
{\an8}<i>♪ ♪</i>

34:45.315 --> 34:47.217
- Okay, well,
that just happened,

34:47.284 --> 34:50.922
and now we got to kind of
make sense of this.

34:50.987 --> 34:52.857
You guys kept your cool. You--

34:52.924 --> 34:54.158
- I mean, I tried.
- Yeah.

34:54.225 --> 34:57.094
- I'm working on
my levels of engagement.

34:57.161 --> 34:58.863
- Yeah, it's tough.
- Keeping it down.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.432
{\an3}- Yeah. What--what happens
between you two?

35:01.499 --> 35:03.100
{\an3}What is that?
You used to be so--

35:03.167 --> 35:06.037
- Oh, it's--you think
it's just Amber, but it's Maci.

35:06.103 --> 35:07.939
It's also Catelynn.

35:08.005 --> 35:11.576
I mean, Amber's the one
who was just more out today.

35:11.642 --> 35:15.646
{\an3}- Well, it seemed like Amber's
always had your back before.

35:15.713 --> 35:17.048
{\an3}She was the one
that was sort of--

35:17.114 --> 35:18.649
- I don't really believe that.
- No, she did.

35:18.716 --> 35:20.785
{\an3}She would always
support you whenever--

35:20.852 --> 35:23.888
{\an3}whenever anybody else had issues
or, you know, concerns.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.456
{\an3}She would always come right
behind to support you.

35:25.523 --> 35:26.657
Remember that?

35:26.724 --> 35:27.892
{\an1}- I don't think I
was around for that.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.160
- I mean, who you
associate yourself with

35:29.227 --> 35:31.829
is really telling
to how you truly feel.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.764
{\an3}- Okay, Amber--Amber seemed
particularly upset

35:33.831 --> 35:37.568
{\an3}about Simon's Snapchat
and about the pedophile comment.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.637
{\an3}That's what got her
flying out here.

35:39.704 --> 35:41.339
That's what she's upset about.
- Okay.

35:41.405 --> 35:43.574
That's her own--
that's her own issue.

35:43.641 --> 35:44.909
{\an3}- And then we had Matt
out here too.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.244
{\an3}He's upset.
He's angry.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.812
- Yeah, they want to hit people.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.914
They want to behave
like criminals,

35:49.981 --> 35:52.583
and that's--that's them.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.118
They have to yell.
They have to fight.

35:54.185 --> 35:57.388
They can't say,
"My feelings were hurt by this."

35:57.455 --> 35:59.690
- But you can relate to
getting out of control

35:59.757 --> 36:01.559
with your feelings.
- Yeah, I can.

36:01.626 --> 36:03.227
- Yeah.
- And it's--

36:03.294 --> 36:05.496
it's not like
I'm here to hit people.

36:05.563 --> 36:10.368
- So apparently what got Amber
going was a phone conversation

36:10.434 --> 36:12.904
she had with you that you were
recording on your end,

36:12.970 --> 36:15.206
and she claims she didn't know.
- Okay.

36:15.273 --> 36:16.974
{\an3}- And then the pedophile
comments, and you--

36:17.041 --> 36:18.743
{\an3}and I guess you made
some comments about Matt

36:18.809 --> 36:21.012
{\an3}in that phone conversation
that got her upset.

36:21.078 --> 36:22.713
- That--everyone is--
was--

36:22.780 --> 36:24.415
I mean, if you watch the show,

36:24.482 --> 36:29.487
everyone was actually
more so loving

36:29.554 --> 36:30.721
that she had a conversation

36:30.788 --> 36:32.890
and someone was truthfully
asking her

36:32.957 --> 36:34.725
about her relationship
and trying to care

36:34.792 --> 36:37.328
and trying to empathize with her

36:37.395 --> 36:39.897
wherever she is
in her relationship,

36:39.964 --> 36:42.466
and if that makes someone angry,

36:42.533 --> 36:45.369
then I don't want to have
a friendship with someone

36:45.436 --> 36:49.740
who also openly knows
she's on a show.

36:49.807 --> 36:51.108
It's hilarious.

36:51.175 --> 36:52.977
I actually think it's hilarity

36:53.044 --> 36:55.413
because if you could actually
be friends with someone,

36:55.479 --> 36:57.548
it would feel like you
could talk about things.

36:57.615 --> 36:59.917
We don't need to bring [bleep]
up to everybody else

36:59.984 --> 37:01.319
and wait till a reunion

37:01.385 --> 37:02.887
like she said
on her Twitter feed,

37:02.954 --> 37:04.422
and you can go back and look.

37:04.488 --> 37:07.058
She's [bleep] crazy,
and I don't want her in my life,

37:07.124 --> 37:09.727
and I don't want anyone else who
associates with her in my life.

37:09.794 --> 37:11.929
- Is there any way to broker
any kind of peace here?

37:11.996 --> 37:13.397
That's what I'm asking.

37:13.464 --> 37:15.633
- Yeah, I'm peaceful, and I hope
she finds her own peace.

37:15.700 --> 37:19.003
- And so how do you work
with her in that situation?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.371
- I let her be her.
- She just does.

37:20.438 --> 37:21.639
- I let her be her.

37:21.706 --> 37:22.807
- You what?
- I let her be her.

37:22.873 --> 37:26.043
I let her embarrass herself,

37:26.110 --> 37:27.678
and maybe she'll watch
this back,

37:27.745 --> 37:29.547
and she'll learn that it's not
really the way to be.

37:29.614 --> 37:31.849
- All right, we got to wrap
this up a bit.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.217
You're good?
- Yeah.

37:33.284 --> 37:35.953
{\an3}- Yeah? You're one piece?
You're fine?

37:36.020 --> 37:37.355
- Yeah, we're gonna go have fun.
- I'm always good.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.256
- Enjoy--enjoy the day.

37:39.323 --> 37:41.058
- You better start dating.
- [stammers]

37:41.125 --> 37:42.426
- No, he's not ready for it.

37:42.493 --> 37:43.628
- No, no, somebody else.

37:43.694 --> 37:45.596
- Oh, yeah, I hear you.
Maybe I have a--

37:45.663 --> 37:46.831
{\an3}- That's your only--
that's your only move.

37:46.897 --> 37:48.232
- Maybe I have
a hot date tonight.

37:48.299 --> 37:49.834
- Ah, go for it.
- All right.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.202
- All right,
we'll be right back.

37:51.268 --> 37:54.205

38:00.878 --> 38:01.812

38:01.879 --> 38:03.347

38:03.414 --> 38:06.517
{\an8}[applause]

38:06.584 --> 38:07.952
{\an8}- All right, welcome back.

38:08.019 --> 38:11.789
We had planned to have
all four moms out here together,

38:11.856 --> 38:13.691
but there have been some issues,

38:13.758 --> 38:15.893
and we need to get things
kind of worked out here,

38:15.960 --> 38:18.629
but after what happened earlier,
unfortunately,

38:18.696 --> 38:20.331
we can't have all four out here,

38:20.398 --> 38:22.233
so I've got the three of you.

38:22.299 --> 38:23.768
- Dr. Drew?
- Yes, ma'am?

38:23.834 --> 38:26.003
- Before you start,

38:26.070 --> 38:30.975
{\an1}so why is our other cast member
not here?

38:31.042 --> 38:32.476
- Um, I don't know.

38:32.543 --> 38:33.644
I mean, I can get--
let me get you a--

38:33.711 --> 38:35.046
{\an3}I can get you
a specific answer.

38:35.112 --> 38:36.714
{\an1}- I don't really want
a specific answer,

38:36.781 --> 38:40.017
but in my opinion--

38:40.084 --> 38:41.152
{\an3}- Sure.

38:41.218 --> 38:43.821
{\an1}- And what I've
gone through today,

38:43.888 --> 38:47.425
I was called early this morning

38:47.491 --> 38:50.194
because apparently
our other cast member,

38:50.261 --> 38:54.665
who onstage was saying
very terrible things

38:54.732 --> 38:58.135
about people who were not on
the stage to defend themselves,

38:58.202 --> 39:00.871
and so since she's not here,

39:00.938 --> 39:02.873
I feel like I can say things

39:02.940 --> 39:05.276
{\an1}without her here
to defend herself.

39:05.342 --> 39:06.644
- But I want to focus in--
- Hold on, hold on, no.

39:06.711 --> 39:08.746
- But you came in early.
You came in early to--to--

39:08.813 --> 39:10.715
- Right--no, I came in early...
- Yeah.

39:10.781 --> 39:12.416
- Because she had...
- Right.

39:12.483 --> 39:15.219
- A "bitch fit."

39:15.286 --> 39:18.622
{\an1}I came in early
to take her spot.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.624
- Mm-hmm.
- And I have done this

39:20.691 --> 39:25.196
{\an1}for the last six, seven,
eight years.

39:25.262 --> 39:28.799
{\an1}I came in early so that
I could leave early,

39:28.866 --> 39:30.634
and I didn't get to leave early.

39:30.701 --> 39:31.736
- But she did.

39:31.802 --> 39:32.970
{\an1}- Because I was
on Farrah's time.

39:33.037 --> 39:35.239
- Yup.
- So Farrah gets to leave

39:35.306 --> 39:36.807
whenever she wants to,

39:36.874 --> 39:38.943
and this is nothing against you.
- Mm-mm.

39:39.009 --> 39:40.244
- I thank you for your time.
- Yes.

39:40.311 --> 39:41.846
- I know you have
a very hard job.

39:41.912 --> 39:43.414
- We love you.
- Yeah, we do.

39:43.481 --> 39:44.815
- This is nothing against you.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.250
- And we love you guys.
- And I thank the audience.

39:46.317 --> 39:48.152
- We love you guys the best.
We--thank you so much.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.855
{\an1}- I thank you so much for being
here and supporting us.

39:50.921 --> 39:52.189
- Yeah.
- But I'm not gonna be

39:52.256 --> 39:55.025
{\an1}on Farrah's time anymore,
so if Farrah can leave

39:55.092 --> 39:57.094
{\an1}when she wants to leave,
I'm leaving.

39:57.161 --> 39:58.462
- We're gonna leave.
- You're leaving now?

39:58.529 --> 39:59.930
- Yes, I am.
- Okay.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.269
And--okay.

40:18.015 --> 40:20.484
- I'm going out there one
more time to thank the audience.

40:20.551 --> 40:21.786
- Can you take this off me?

40:21.852 --> 40:23.487
- Yeah, that's what
I'm gonna do.

40:23.554 --> 40:25.856
- Well, I--I did not know
that was gonna happen,

40:25.923 --> 40:27.825
but I appreciate
that what you're seeing--

40:27.892 --> 40:29.693
I hope you appreciate--
is reality.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.061
This really happened tonight,

40:31.128 --> 40:33.230
and this concludes
our finale special.

40:33.297 --> 40:34.765
I do want to thank
all the moms,

40:34.832 --> 40:36.333
their kids,
their significant others,

40:36.400 --> 40:37.935
and the extended families
for being here

40:38.002 --> 40:40.104
and continuing to share
their lives with us.

40:40.171 --> 40:41.672
I want you to remember
that a young woman

40:41.739 --> 40:43.974
who has sex regularly
and does not use birth control

40:44.041 --> 40:46.811
has a 90% chance of getting
pregnant within a year.

and prevention at bedsider.org.

40:51.048 --> 40:53.150

Thank you for watching.

40:53.217 --> 40:56.153
{\an8}[cheers and applause]
