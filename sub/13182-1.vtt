00:09.708 --> 00:12.875
I'm worried the restaurant,
it lacks something.

00:13.083 --> 00:14.791
Customers?

00:16.125 --> 00:18.333
No one will be surprised
when they come in anymore.

00:18.542 --> 00:23.000
- Have you seen their faces?
- Yes. "Is the place still here?"

00:23.208 --> 00:27.000
Okay, so the restaurant is trustworthy,
but not surprising.

00:27.208 --> 00:31.082
- What would surprise you?
- Customers.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.417
I never liked you.

00:32.625 --> 00:35.125
I tolerate you,
but I've never liked you.

00:35.625 --> 00:36.958
Here you are.

00:38.959 --> 00:41.209
I can show you what I have today.

00:44.792 --> 00:49.167
This fountain was built in 1903
Mortimer Hayward.

00:49.334 --> 00:52.667
- Have Beekman changed the design again?
- For God's sake.

00:52.875 --> 00:55.791
- It is Saturday.
- When does he expect it?

00:56.000 --> 00:59.209
I wish you spent as
much time on your privacy.

00:59.417 --> 01:01.917
- Mom, I have lots of starlets.
- First Dates.

01:02.834 --> 01:04.501
- Hey!
- Your father and I ...

01:04.709 --> 01:08.459
... Soon celebrate 40-year anniversary.
Do you know why?

01:08.667 --> 01:12.209
Because he asked me out
on a second date.

01:13.667 --> 01:16.042
- Sorry, Joe.
- You have not much time.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.834
- Your father was bald at an early age.
- Wait.

01:19.542 --> 01:20.626
Dad has hair.

01:20.834 --> 01:22.751
Well, it can be discussed.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.584
No, it's my mother who harasses
me about my love life again.

01:27.792 --> 01:31.584
Yes, if there was ever reason,
to come in to the office one weekend ...

01:31.792 --> 01:34.709
I have distributed leaflets
local kontorsbyggnader-

01:34.918 --> 01:37.209
-Short campaigns on social medier-

01:38.042 --> 01:40.667
- Donated to local events
to raise the profile.

01:40.876 --> 01:43.459
Nat, we've been friends a long time now-

01:43.667 --> 01:48.082
- So I think I can say this,
without hurting your feelings.

01:48.292 --> 01:50.292
Stop with the opera.

01:50.501 --> 01:53.834
There is a wall of opera,
as soon as you come through the door.

01:54.042 --> 01:55.459
Mom loved the opera.

01:55.667 --> 01:58.375
She loved the customers too.

01:58.584 --> 02:02.751
I know the restaurant
is your familjearv. I understand that.

02:02.959 --> 02:05.542
But it has not been the same.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.792
I know. Do not you think I know that?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.876
That's why I have a new chef on the road.

02:10.082 --> 02:14.167
I was hoping that after six
months would have found that ...

02:14.375 --> 02:16.834
- I do not know.
- Magic?

02:17.042 --> 02:20.417
Yes, I figured I
perhaps could find it.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.042
- Oh my God, it's Lori Beth?
- Who?

02:24.250 --> 02:26.709
Lori Beth Wacker.
From the seventh grade, remember?

02:26.918 --> 02:28.000
Lori Beth.

02:28.209 --> 02:29.918
- Hello.
- Hello.

02:31.334 --> 02:33.501
- Lovely to meet you.
- Yes.

02:33.709 --> 02:35.876
Your mother told me
that you were at home again.

02:36.082 --> 02:38.167
- Lori Beth. How are you?
- Nick. Hello.

02:38.959 --> 02:43.042
I moved home for a couple of months ago.
How wonderful to meet you.

02:43.250 --> 02:47.082
- How long ago was it?
- 15 years.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.626
My one true love.

02:48.834 --> 02:50.584
And my biggest regret.

02:50.792 --> 02:52.667
To lose touch when we moved.

02:52.876 --> 02:54.751
But what a coincidence.

02:54.959 --> 02:57.209
You know, Nick is a talented architect now.

02:57.417 --> 02:59.584
He constructs bridges.

02:59.792 --> 03:01.375
Nick, give her your card.

03:01.584 --> 03:03.876
You always wanted to build things.

03:04.082 --> 03:07.959
- Change the world.
- I do not exactly, but ...

03:08.167 --> 03:10.292
Lori Beth works with
landscape planning.

03:11.626 --> 03:14.042
Architect. Landscape.

03:14.250 --> 03:15.459
It must be fate.

03:17.209 --> 03:20.375
Speaking of work,
I like to work.

03:20.584 --> 03:23.584
- Really nice to meet you, Lori Beth.
- You too, Nick.

03:23.792 --> 03:25.751
- I'll call you.
- Awesome.

03:25.959 --> 03:28.542
We have lots to catch up after so long.

03:28.751 --> 03:29.876
There you have indeed.

03:30.082 --> 03:32.959
- So call him.
- Okay, I will.

03:33.167 --> 03:35.459
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:35.667 --> 03:38.250
We just happened to run into each other?

03:39.082 --> 03:40.334
What a coincidence.

03:40.542 --> 03:43.042
Life is full of coincidences.

03:43.250 --> 03:47.000
Although sometimes
need to give them a little push.

03:50.125 --> 03:52.959
I feel so bad about
you do not earn any tip.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.501
Want to quit?

03:54.709 --> 03:55.959
I want you to stop.

03:56.167 --> 04:00.834
Stop believing that you have to drive instead
exactly as it was when your mother was alive.

04:02.417 --> 04:04.125
Sorry, Nat.

04:04.334 --> 04:06.834
- I did not mean ...
- It's okay. It's just that ...

04:07.334 --> 04:10.167
If it does not start to go well
I will lose the restaurant.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.000
Both I and the restaurant
is stuck in the past.

04:15.709 --> 04:17.166
Come on.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.000
- Grandma!
- Uncle Nick!

04:20.209 --> 04:21.834
Ungar. Hello.

04:22.041 --> 04:23.666
- Look.
- I like these.

04:23.875 --> 04:27.500
Are we late? We took a detour
past the girls' favorite store.

04:27.709 --> 04:30.709
- Neon and glitter house.
- So it is said not at all.

04:30.918 --> 04:35.167
Mom found yet another way to
introduce me to a future daughter in law.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.083
Lori Beth Wacker.
He used to be crazy about her.

04:38.291 --> 04:39.917
- I was 12th
- Grandma.

04:40.125 --> 04:43.250
- Can we get 25-centare to the wishing well?
- 25 cents?

04:43.459 --> 04:45.167
In my time it was a penny.

04:46.541 --> 04:49.581
Do not look at me, I spent all
my money on neon and glitter house.

04:49.605 --> 04:51.500
- It's not that.
- No?

04:51.709 --> 04:54.042
25-centare.
Uncle Nick has 25-centare.

04:54.250 --> 04:57.834
- Now we go and wish us something.
- You will be glad you did.

04:58.416 --> 05:02.750
They are beautiful. Maybe I should
buy some at the restaurant.

05:03.375 --> 05:06.541
Good morning, ladies.
A bouquet to brighten up the day?

05:06.750 --> 05:09.666
- Yes. They are wonderful.
- 5.99 per bouquet.

05:09.875 --> 05:13.041
All right. I'll take these.

05:15.584 --> 05:17.667
- Please.
- Keep it.

05:17.875 --> 05:19.166
No, she takes it.

05:19.375 --> 05:23.083
- No, it's okay.
- Take it, just.

05:25.541 --> 05:26.708
Thank you.

05:26.918 --> 05:29.709
Sorry. What do you do?

05:29.918 --> 05:31.584
All right.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.584
You need this.

05:35.791 --> 05:38.458
Wishing you a surprise.

05:40.416 --> 05:43.416
To bring order in a restaurant
does not happen by magic.

05:43.625 --> 05:46.291
If you knew surprise
would go 'compliance

05:46.500 --> 05:48.000
What would you wish for?

05:48.209 --> 05:51.625
You should always hold on
with my love life ...

05:55.625 --> 05:56.875
Looking for a penny?

05:57.083 --> 05:59.834
I have everything I could dream of.

06:00.041 --> 06:01.917
But if I had one wish for you ...

06:02.125 --> 06:04.541
Then you would wish
I did not have to become bald.

06:05.125 --> 06:08.083
I wish
that you would forget her.

06:08.834 --> 06:15.584
I know how you felt about Jessa,
but you must go on, darling.

06:15.791 --> 06:18.333
You have to find the right one.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:05.834 --> 07:08.375
I bet that my desire
wrapping before yours.

07:12.791 --> 07:14.833
The time is almost 11:00. We must draw.

07:15.375 --> 07:16.834
Goodbye old man.

07:27.709 --> 07:31.125
- Did he give you truly bill?
- The waitress came to us ...

07:31.334 --> 07:34.292
... And then he put the bill
in front of me, as if I'd ...

07:34.500 --> 07:35.917
No, I do not believe you.

07:36.125 --> 07:39.875
- Hold on.
- How long were we together? Two weeks?

07:40.083 --> 07:41.834
I have trouble believing it.

07:42.041 --> 07:44.791
- What kind of guy does that?
- A 44-year old man.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.375
I guess it is.

07:46.584 --> 07:49.417
OPEN

07:56.416 --> 07:58.583
I saw it.

07:59.250 --> 08:00.959
I saw it.

08:13.959 --> 08:17.000
If the city chooses solar,
we can connect the bridge to nätet-

08:17.209 --> 08:21.292
- Then you get the power when it needs to,
and gives back what is left over.

08:21.875 --> 08:23.834
Would you tell him?

08:24.875 --> 08:27.416
Mr. Beekman, sir. Good morning.

08:27.959 --> 08:31.209
- Thanks for coming in over the weekend.
- A deadline is a deadline.

08:31.416 --> 08:33.207
We understand. And do not worry.

08:33.417 --> 08:36.333
I'll give it a Beekman-touch.

08:36.542 --> 08:39.125
It is therefore planning committee
will come to you.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.125
- Have you been presented to any customer?
- Not a chance.

08:47.458 --> 08:48.750
Where is he?

08:48.958 --> 08:51.500
I'm not sure.
He would fly into yesterday.

08:51.708 --> 08:53.750
I can cook, if he will not.

08:54.417 --> 08:58.834
Thanks, Damien, but you may
can replenish the salt and pepper pots.

08:59.042 --> 09:00.500
Sure.

09:05.167 --> 09:07.292
There he is. Our new chef.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.583
Natalia.

09:15.375 --> 09:16.833
What's he saying?

09:17.625 --> 09:20.250
He thinks I'm
a radiant beauty. Sweet.

09:20.458 --> 09:22.583
You are not bad yourself.
My name Sharla.

09:22.792 --> 09:25.292
With "A", which kind is Italian.

09:25.500 --> 09:29.625
Yes, keep staring at me,
with the dark brown eyes.

09:29.833 --> 09:31.875
His name is Mario. Mario.

09:32.082 --> 09:35.500
You said he was an old man
from Italy. He is not old age.

09:35.708 --> 09:40.000
I hope he can cook,
for it promised my relatives.

09:41.458 --> 09:48.375
I'm sorry that I could not
welcome you at the airport yesterday.

09:49.375 --> 09:51.792
I do not know how to
say it in Italian.

09:53.208 --> 09:56.000
No problem. I feel
your warm welcome.

09:56.208 --> 09:59.791
- Okay, Natalia.
- And he speaks English.

10:00.583 --> 10:04.166
- Should I cook tonight?
- Yes, let me show you the kitchen.

10:04.375 --> 10:06.750
It is a rather simple kitchen.

10:06.958 --> 10:09.917
- Everything ...
- Idiot.

10:11.542 --> 10:13.500
Anyone here?

10:15.208 --> 10:17.000
Hello? Hello.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.958
No, mom. I told you
did not have to bring your lunch.

10:20.167 --> 10:22.625
I just want to be sure
you get a decent meal.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.250
- Hey, Joe.
- Hello.

10:24.458 --> 10:27.208
- I have something for you too.
- I love your mom.

10:27.417 --> 10:30.334
Told Nick that we ran into his ex?

10:30.542 --> 10:33.209
- Love of his life.
- Yes, when I was 12th

10:33.417 --> 10:35.500
Then she moved
and broke his heart.

10:35.708 --> 10:38.000
I was 12th

10:38.208 --> 10:39.458
His first kiss.

10:39.667 --> 10:42.417
- When you were 12th
- So it got stuck.

10:42.918 --> 10:45.500
- I want you to take her out.
- No, Mom.

10:45.708 --> 10:47.791
You're a super-mom.
I love you.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
How many times have I told you
not to fix me up with ...

10:52.208 --> 10:54.291
Stand-up evening at the Comedy Cellar.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.625
Tomorrow, noon. 20:00.

10:56.833 --> 11:00.333
Lori Beth loves to laugh.
It's a date.

11:00.542 --> 11:03.542
- I fixed it for you.
- Yes.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.042
There are only two here.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.583
Did not you buy three?

11:07.792 --> 11:10.083
- So you can put yourself in a little more.
- May I?

11:10.292 --> 11:13.209
There are extra mustard in the bag, Joe.

11:13.417 --> 11:15.167
Your mom is the best.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.458
Do you think Lori Beth has a friend?

11:18.458 --> 11:19.917
Do not let me down.

11:20.125 --> 11:23.125
She might become your come true
fountain desire.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.750
No, my desire was to win
environmentally friendly bridge contest.

11:26.958 --> 11:29.791
Come on, not so loud.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.833
Beekman will find ...

11:59.000 --> 12:00.833
How is it?

12:02.208 --> 12:04.082
It's not the same.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.082
It is better.

12:07.625 --> 12:10.667
Awesome. I'll tell the chef.

12:12.333 --> 12:15.125
- Wonderful.
- I think it's great.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.750
- Is it a new dish?
- Where's the garlic?

12:18.792 --> 12:20.250
Right.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.875
They love the food.

12:28.333 --> 12:31.875
- What are you looking for?
- One of the regulars like extra garlic.

12:33.042 --> 12:35.667
Alfredo sauce.
I know it's weird, but ...

12:36.458 --> 12:38.041
- Wait, wait.
- No, do not worry.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.750
- It's just his thing.
- His thing is not my thing.

12:40.958 --> 12:42.833
- What? Wait. Mario.
- Alfredo sauce.

12:43.042 --> 12:44.375
Mario.

12:48.042 --> 12:49.334
- Hello.
- Extra garlic?

12:49.542 --> 12:52.125
- Please.
- Additional more?

12:58.208 --> 13:01.917
What he means is that he appreciates
Your suggestions for extra garlic.

13:02.125 --> 13:05.167
I told you to eat like a pig.

13:06.625 --> 13:07.667
All right.

13:07.875 --> 13:10.875
No no no. The house offers ...

13:13.833 --> 13:16.833
Natalia, you need more clienti.

13:17.042 --> 13:19.292
I can not cook without customers.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.167
I can cook.

13:45.082 --> 13:47.416
You have two new voice messages.

13:47.625 --> 13:48.833
New message.

13:49.042 --> 13:52.459
Hey, it's Amanda.
Thank you for dinner the other night.

13:52.667 --> 13:56.875
Hey, I heard about the art show
and I wondered ...

13:57.082 --> 13:59.583
Hello, this is Kelly from the coffee mill.

13:59.792 --> 14:04.125
I do not usually do like this,
but I thought of you ...

14:12.417 --> 14:16.500
PRICE FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BRIDGE
ARCHITECTURAL INSTITUTE

14:16.708 --> 14:17.958
Together we build

15:34.375 --> 15:37.875
When the cycle repeats itself,
along Aruba's coastal

15:38.082 --> 15:40.750
- Seeking the male flamingo
for a partner.

15:40.958 --> 15:43.458
You have a new voice message.

15:43.667 --> 15:47.500
Hello, Natalie. It's Ellis, Sharlas cousin.
We met at her party.

15:47.708 --> 15:49.666
Sharla said you need to get out.

15:49.875 --> 15:52.125
No, wait, that did not sound good.

15:52.333 --> 15:54.583
Anyway, I like to eat food.

15:54.792 --> 15:56.792
Wait, wait, it rings.

16:13.250 --> 16:17.042
But it is not good on the island,
and our flamingo family kämpar-

16:17.250 --> 16:20.875
- To survive the harsh,
windy autumn.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.792
Want a table?

17:04.290 --> 17:06.000
A table?

17:07.625 --> 17:09.000
Wait.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.415
How did I get here?

17:16.040 --> 17:18.415
I recognize this place.

17:18.790 --> 17:21.082
Where is everyone?

17:21.500 --> 17:23.540
It's just us.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.709
My name is Natalie.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.959
Hello, Natalie. I called Nick.

17:32.625 --> 17:37.000
- It feels like I've seen you before.
- I know. It feels ...

17:37.334 --> 17:38.614
I feel like I know you.

17:45.666 --> 17:47.583
Excuse me.

17:58.125 --> 18:00.334
I think it's for you.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.292
To me?

18:11.500 --> 18:12.541
It is you.

18:13.750 --> 18:17.375
No, it's my mother.

18:20.416 --> 18:23.250
You've obviously inherited her spirit.

18:23.459 --> 18:24.875
Thank you.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.791
Who are you?

18:32.375 --> 18:35.791
You are so beautiful.

18:40.291 --> 18:42.708
Did I like it?

18:43.041 --> 18:44.958
It's nothing.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.959
During the summer months,
the snow penguins water source.

19:04.166 --> 19:07.500
When he received nourishment, he
viability to proceed.

19:20.750 --> 19:23.291
It was a dream, but it was so real.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.625
Especially the part where you woke up
alone in your pajamas.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.334
- On my sofa.
- Did he look like Justin Timberlake?

19:29.541 --> 19:31.125
- Better looking.
- No one is prettier ...

19:31.334 --> 19:34.334
... Than Justin Timberlake.
It was definitely a dream.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.583
- Called my cousin Ellis you?
- Yes.

19:36.791 --> 19:38.708
Why did you say to him to do it?

19:38.917 --> 19:43.041
Heart, I say this with love,
you have to call him up.

19:49.291 --> 19:52.875
If you do not like to work on Saturday,
did not come in on Sunday.

19:53.083 --> 19:55.584
- I know, buddy.
- Is that brotävlingen?

19:55.791 --> 19:57.458
We have drawings to finish.

20:01.209 --> 20:04.292
Lori Beth has set a countdown clock
for our date tonight.

20:05.125 --> 20:07.917
I get alerts every hour.

20:08.125 --> 20:11.125
- Has she always been so?
- I do not know. I was 12th

20:11.334 --> 20:14.334
- She was sweet. Who remembers?
- Hon.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.209
Doomsday Clock back?

20:17.834 --> 20:21.459
Now texting me she outfits to
see what she'll wear tonight.

20:21.666 --> 20:24.291
She sends copies to the mother also.
It's amazing.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.500
Dates are canceled.

20:27.166 --> 20:29.125
I can not. My mother would kill me.

20:29.291 --> 20:30.291
Mother Pig?

20:30.500 --> 20:34.791
Kiddos. How is it going in the sandbox?
Are you finished with the drawings?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.250
Almost.

20:36.459 --> 20:38.000
Very, very soon.

20:38.209 --> 20:40.667
We're doing it. No problem.

20:47.334 --> 20:50.459
- Set aside brotävlingen.
- I will.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.791
Hold on.

20:53.541 --> 20:55.333
- What is it white?
- Do you like it?

20:55.541 --> 20:59.291
I added this solar array,
to help the bridge to generate power.

20:59.666 --> 21:00.958
- It's brilliant.
- I know right?

21:01.166 --> 21:05.833
I mean it. But you heard him.
We must focus on the drawings.

21:06.041 --> 21:07.917
If he finds out the competition, you are screwed.

21:08.125 --> 21:11.166
You can not only participate in various
races when you're working for him.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.959
I know. I just ...

21:14.834 --> 21:18.083
I have to keep the brain in shape.

21:24.041 --> 21:25.625
Hey, Mario.

21:29.209 --> 21:30.250
Limoncello?

21:30.459 --> 21:32.500
Yes. For tiramisun.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.584
It is not possible.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.083
Yes, it is possible.

21:36.291 --> 21:39.416
No. This is my kitchen, okay?

21:40.083 --> 21:41.417
This is my kitchen.

21:42.250 --> 21:46.000
Our kitchen, no problem,
però no limoncello in tiramisun.

21:46.209 --> 21:48.709
It is a recipe from my grandmother
with a twist.

21:48.917 --> 21:50.375
But she was well Greeks?

21:50.584 --> 21:52.875
- What's the difference?
- Another recipe.

21:53.083 --> 21:56.083
Not only does this recipe, all recipe.
It is time, Mario.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.042
Come and taste with me.

21:59.250 --> 22:02.083
Together we create magic.

22:02.584 --> 22:04.959
All right. About five minutes.

22:05.166 --> 22:06.833
Five minutes.

22:09.291 --> 22:12.333
What? He is Italian.
He is so with all women.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.791
Well, he does not want to
cook with me,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.625
- Which is a shame,
for it would be tough.

22:19.041 --> 22:24.250
Okay, I'll see about it
are any clienti. I'm okay.

22:25.541 --> 22:27.250
- Madame.
- Will.

22:27.625 --> 22:29.041
Excuse me.

22:29.250 --> 22:32.291
- It will be good.
- Excuse me.

22:38.125 --> 22:40.166
What do you think?

22:40.584 --> 22:43.542
Outfit. Yes.
I think it is the best.

22:43.750 --> 22:45.250
- Do you think?
- Yes, absolutely.

22:45.459 --> 22:47.625
I do not look like 12 anymore?

22:47.834 --> 22:49.584
Do I?

22:49.917 --> 22:52.041
- Nice to see you again.
- The same.

22:52.250 --> 22:53.875
We're going to hit.

23:12.125 --> 23:15.083
FREE TIRAMISU

23:18.416 --> 23:21.666
- What's this?
- "Storage b ..." What?

23:22.166 --> 23:25.291
- Some kind of pasta?
- 'L'Agrifoglio. "

23:26.000 --> 23:27.459
Something sort of wine.

23:28.083 --> 23:29.292
L'Agrifoglio.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.791
It means "holly" in Italian.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.959
It was the name of my grandmother
restaurant in Italy.

23:35.166 --> 23:37.541
The place was covered with holly.

23:37.750 --> 23:41.625
- It was exactly like this.
- So it is authentic Italian?

23:42.125 --> 23:45.416
With a twist.
And tonight we tiramisu.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.834
- On the house.
- I am in.

23:48.041 --> 23:50.250
- Come on, Gloria.
- Okay.

23:50.459 --> 23:53.125
- Awesome.
- What's the twist?

23:53.334 --> 23:55.375
Tonight? Two new customers.

23:56.459 --> 23:58.542
Then it is best that I go.

24:04.416 --> 24:07.583
It was hilarious.
Sure, he was funny?

24:07.791 --> 24:11.166
Yes, he was ...
He was pretty funny.

24:11.625 --> 24:16.125
What do we do now?
Should we relive time-

24:16.334 --> 24:19.709
- When we skipped homework
and hid in the library?

24:19.959 --> 24:22.875
- In this case, it would be adorable.
- Then we'll go.

24:23.083 --> 24:25.542
Your mother thought it was super fun.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.750
- Really?
- Or when my brother Luke ...

24:27.959 --> 24:30.792
... Got his driver's license and
took us to the drive-in?

24:31.000 --> 24:34.416
- Do you remember the children's banned the film?
- Yes, so you ...

24:34.625 --> 24:36.917
So you told everything to my mom?

24:37.125 --> 24:40.334
Yes, today, when she helped me
to choose the outfit.

24:42.584 --> 24:46.667
You, I think I
is a bit overworked at jobbet-

24:46.875 --> 24:50.791
-so I should probably go home and sleep.

25:07.750 --> 25:10.625
Tip. Accurate tip.

25:11.334 --> 25:12.417
- Tiramisu.
- Thanks.

25:12.625 --> 25:14.209
- On the house.
- Awesome.

25:14.416 --> 25:15.875
Thank you.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.333
Are you okay?

25:26.917 --> 25:27.958
Yes.

25:28.166 --> 25:31.000
Damiano, the floor is wet.
It must be dry.

25:32.666 --> 25:34.375
My ... My hero.

25:35.416 --> 25:37.000
I am a hero, huh?

25:37.209 --> 25:39.000
- Yes. Can ...? Can you help me?
- Yes.

25:39.209 --> 25:41.250
- Yes, we have to work.
- Okay.

25:41.709 --> 25:45.000
Remember when you found out
I wrote "Mrs. Lori Beth Smith" -

25:45.209 --> 25:46.875
-over my notebook?

25:47.083 --> 25:49.500
I was ashamed as an animal.

25:50.709 --> 25:54.167
- Here is my car.
- Okay.

25:55.834 --> 26:00.750
Lori Beth, I really appreciate
you went out with me.

26:01.125 --> 26:02.666
I was really my mother.

26:04.125 --> 26:06.791
That's not why I'm here, Nick.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.500
I thought maybe it would
was something between us.

26:10.291 --> 26:12.875
I've always wondered about you.

26:13.083 --> 26:14.918
But now we're together again.

26:15.125 --> 26:18.584
I updated my online status
to "In a relationship with Nick Smith".

26:19.541 --> 26:21.500
You might want to remove it.

26:23.125 --> 26:25.375
Are you breaking up with me?

26:25.584 --> 26:29.334
It does not end
if not even been together.

26:29.541 --> 26:35.541
I've just taken me through something
quite intensively with someone and ...

26:40.166 --> 26:43.458
- It was great, Nat.
- Thank you, Sharla. Good night.

26:47.584 --> 26:51.292
- Thanks. Have a good evening.
- Good night, Damien. You too.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.125
Natalia.

26:56.500 --> 27:02.125
Limoncello in tiramisu is not original
recipe, but perhaps not so bad.

27:03.750 --> 27:07.834
- That's big of you to admit, Mario.
- I am great.

27:10.250 --> 27:11.750
Big heart.

27:13.416 --> 27:16.666
Do you like me?

27:19.291 --> 27:21.375
- As a chef?
- Yes.

27:22.917 --> 27:25.708
Yes. The paste is incredible.

27:25.917 --> 27:29.583
And main dishes
we can work on, but ...

27:30.584 --> 27:32.750
Che "working on".

27:33.291 --> 27:36.166
Okay, Natalia.
You teach me how to cook?

27:36.375 --> 27:38.291
- No.
- Natalia teaches Mario. All right.

27:38.500 --> 27:41.000
No, it was a ...
It was a good night, Mario.

27:41.209 --> 27:43.375
Now we will be sure to get some sleep.

27:48.125 --> 27:51.541
Some sleep.
You get some sleep.

27:51.750 --> 27:54.917
You go to your home, and I ...

27:55.125 --> 27:57.459
Now we sleep.

27:58.125 --> 27:59.500
Yes.

28:00.625 --> 28:02.041
All right.

28:04.166 --> 28:08.250
Natalia, your mother and my mother,
were friends in school.

28:08.959 --> 28:13.334
My mom wanted to tell
she is very sad.

28:14.041 --> 28:16.082
Your beautiful mother.

28:16.291 --> 28:18.708
Your beautiful mother.

28:52.917 --> 28:56.041
The trees were taken over by savannen-

28:56.250 --> 28:59.625
- And giraffes fighting
a war against the woods

28:59.834 --> 29:03.417
- To claim the country
we now call Africa.

29:12.875 --> 29:15.709
The highest animals
devoured the highest grenarna-

29:15.917 --> 29:20.541
- While the elephants used their strength
to lift the trees for nourishment.

29:32.166 --> 29:34.291
- Careful!
- It's okay.

29:35.416 --> 29:36.666
I can fly.

29:36.875 --> 29:40.459
Do not do that. Please.
I just got here.

29:41.625 --> 29:43.875
I want to feel alive.

29:44.083 --> 29:46.542
Really live. Would not you?

29:47.541 --> 29:48.750
Only ...

29:48.959 --> 29:51.042
I want to take risks.

29:51.750 --> 29:53.750
Is not it about time?

29:54.166 --> 29:56.082
Look, it's so beautiful out there.

30:05.584 --> 30:08.375
Look there. Do you see?

30:09.041 --> 30:11.082
- I see nothing.
- Exactly.

30:11.291 --> 30:15.917
This is where I hope
my bridge will stand.

30:16.375 --> 30:17.625
What bridge?

30:17.834 --> 30:21.625
I submitted a design
to a city contest.

30:22.584 --> 30:24.167
You design bridges?

30:24.375 --> 30:29.625
I do most drafts, but yes,
this is mine.

30:29.834 --> 30:32.334
I think that is good.

30:33.209 --> 30:34.959
I see it.

30:35.209 --> 30:38.042
There it is. I see it.

30:39.709 --> 30:43.042
- Have they built it? How is that possible?
- It is fantastic.

30:44.209 --> 30:45.584
You are talented.

30:45.791 --> 30:47.625
That's why.

30:48.917 --> 30:50.583
It must be amazing.

30:50.791 --> 30:56.041
To create something,
and make it a reality.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.959
It's not as scary up here.

31:10.125 --> 31:11.625
No.

31:12.791 --> 31:15.166
My mother used to say:

31:16.875 --> 31:19.416
"Spread your wings, Natalie."

31:29.834 --> 31:32.250
You smell good.

31:33.834 --> 31:37.792
Amaretti. I baked today.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.334
- What is amaretti?
- Cakes.

31:41.166 --> 31:43.041
To the restaurant.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.834
Let me show you something.

31:55.291 --> 31:57.250
The floating ...

31:57.666 --> 32:02.000
Liberate themselves from their frames.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.625
You get a taste of the magic.

32:23.375 --> 32:26.375
What? And you say
you do not create something?

32:27.125 --> 32:30.959
I? Create? I just ... I cook.

32:36.041 --> 32:39.041
For me ...

32:41.416 --> 32:43.166
... It tastes like a creation.

32:45.416 --> 32:47.666
You may be right.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.416
DREAM ENCYCLOPEDIA

33:19.416 --> 33:23.250
You interpret dreams?
Do you dream of me?

33:23.459 --> 33:25.417
Dreams revealing
our innermost secrets.

33:25.625 --> 33:27.834
And desires, bella.

33:28.459 --> 33:30.375
Yes. I have to work.

33:30.584 --> 33:34.417
Here, an old family recipe
from Umbria. With a twist.

33:35.959 --> 33:38.709
She called me in tears.

33:39.209 --> 33:40.542
Okay, I'm a pig.

33:40.750 --> 33:43.083
You and several others.

33:43.291 --> 33:46.791
She has had three broken engagements
recent years.

33:47.166 --> 33:50.125
- Three?
- Two, three.

33:50.334 --> 33:55.167
It means that she is ready,
but have not found the right person.

33:56.500 --> 34:00.416
Have you ever dreamed
if someone you've never met?

34:00.625 --> 34:03.083
As the dream of Jack Nicholson?

34:03.291 --> 34:05.250
A young, virile, Jack Nicholson?

34:05.459 --> 34:08.333
No, mom.
Forget I mentioned it.

34:08.833 --> 34:12.081
Have you found a dream girl, darling?

34:14.291 --> 34:19.625
This is going to sound ridiculous,
but I dream about this nice girl.

34:19.833 --> 34:22.166
She is so real.

34:22.375 --> 34:25.416
More real than any
I ever met.

34:25.626 --> 34:27.626
That's wonderful.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.041
If you dream of a special GIRLS

34:30.250 --> 34:33.833
- Prepares your brain you on
to fall in love for real.

34:34.333 --> 34:36.750
This is very promising.

34:36.958 --> 34:39.708
My job as a mother is ready for today.

34:39.918 --> 34:41.666
Good to know.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.708
Mario, an excellent evening. Thank you.

34:52.375 --> 34:53.958
- Thanks, you guys. Good night.
- Bye.

34:54.166 --> 34:56.166
- We'll see.
- Bye.

34:57.583 --> 35:01.750
Neither a wink or kiss
for poor Mario?

35:01.958 --> 35:06.041
Do you dream about that guy who is
prettier than Justin Timberlake again?

35:06.250 --> 35:08.416
Two nights in a row.

35:08.626 --> 35:10.667
- Wow.
- I know.

35:10.876 --> 35:13.876
He's just like anybody I
would be with the real thing.

35:14.083 --> 35:15.626
Why do not I have such dreams?

35:15.833 --> 35:21.458
When I'm with him, it feels like
we have always known each other.

35:21.666 --> 35:25.500
It's like a fantasy.

35:25.708 --> 35:28.500
I agree probably going mad.

35:28.708 --> 35:32.791
I can not wait until I go to sleep
so that I might get to meet him.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.541
- Am I crazy?
- Yes. Maybe.

35:35.751 --> 35:42.083
What do you do if you met the love,
though he exists only in one's fantasy

35:42.291 --> 35:47.083
- And there is no chance of it
will meet, for he is pretending?

35:48.250 --> 35:52.416
And what if the life-

35:53.583 --> 35:59.041
- Are so much better in dreams,
that it never felt more alive.

36:03.583 --> 36:08.250
I think you should get some sleep.

37:10.918 --> 37:12.751
This is crazy.

37:17.918 --> 37:19.501
All right.

38:53.416 --> 38:56.500
Will this continue
night after night?

38:58.666 --> 39:00.833
I was hoping to see you here.

39:02.083 --> 39:05.041
Plums. My favorite.

39:06.291 --> 39:07.458
Oh, this.

39:07.791 --> 39:09.750
It is unreal good.
You must taste.

39:09.958 --> 39:11.791
- Careful.
- I'll be careful.

39:17.666 --> 39:20.125
Wow, wonderful.

39:20.583 --> 39:23.208
- Like a snowball fight?
- You lose.

39:23.416 --> 39:25.958
I doubt it. Oh, no!

39:27.125 --> 39:28.876
Wait, you can not ... It's not fair.

39:29.083 --> 39:31.250
I beat you.

39:31.791 --> 39:33.875
You let me win, right?

39:36.458 --> 39:40.000
I used to have a picnic on a
place like this when I was little.

39:41.666 --> 39:43.875
Had the mood lighting?

39:47.501 --> 39:51.125
Plums and plates with food.

39:54.166 --> 39:57.166
Everything is good, except the broccoli.

39:57.918 --> 39:59.876
You've never tasted my broccoli.

40:00.083 --> 40:02.041
I own an Italian restaurant, you know.

40:02.250 --> 40:03.333
Is that so?

40:06.000 --> 40:08.166
What are we doing here?

40:08.375 --> 40:15.208
I guess I can take you there,
and cook some special broccoli.

40:17.208 --> 40:18.833
If you want.

40:20.958 --> 40:22.875
I would love to.

40:24.208 --> 40:25.666
All right.

40:26.208 --> 40:27.875
Harat.

40:31.958 --> 40:35.041
When she fell ill, I cooked food
and took me to the hospital.

40:35.250 --> 40:38.333
But she was so weak
that she could not eat.

40:38.541 --> 40:43.291
The food was something we shared all these years.

40:44.208 --> 40:45.833
Since she died ...

40:46.041 --> 40:50.041
As soon as you think of her,
reminds the restaurant you about her.

40:51.208 --> 40:53.000
I ... It must be difficult.

40:53.208 --> 40:59.166
That every day reminded anyone
you love that can not be there.

40:59.375 --> 41:02.708
You have to put
your own stamp on the place.

41:02.918 --> 41:05.666
Really make it your own.

41:08.541 --> 41:10.708
How long have we walked?

41:10.918 --> 41:13.626
I think we're close.

41:13.833 --> 41:15.500
All night?

41:16.041 --> 41:17.750
It's nothing.

41:19.876 --> 41:22.709
You will become a famous designer.
It shows.

41:22.918 --> 41:24.375
Do you think so?

41:25.083 --> 41:26.166
I do not know.

41:26.375 --> 41:31.208
Do you believe, deep down, that it is
normal to doubt himself?

41:31.416 --> 41:33.918
I think it is abnormal
not to do it.

41:34.125 --> 41:38.041
But you will win the prize.
You'll see.

41:38.250 --> 41:39.918
Oh, I ...

41:40.458 --> 41:46.250
I think we went wrong.
I think we should be there.

41:48.125 --> 41:49.751
It's okay.

41:49.958 --> 41:52.625
- I've been nice.
- Me too.

41:53.918 --> 41:55.918
Tomorrow night perhaps?

41:56.291 --> 41:57.958
Definitely.

42:03.626 --> 42:06.667
- I think I'm starting ...
- I know.

42:07.708 --> 42:09.291
So do I.

42:15.125 --> 42:18.083
- Tomorrow.
- Yes.

43:04.501 --> 43:06.125
You must try. Squid pasta.

43:06.333 --> 43:09.458
All right. With a twist.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.626
This is definitely not the opera.

43:14.833 --> 43:18.875
- What do you think?
- It was about time. But this ...

43:25.333 --> 43:26.958
I can hardly believe.

43:28.125 --> 43:30.250
It is hard to say "L'Agrifoglio".

43:30.458 --> 43:32.416
"Russo's Italian."

43:32.626 --> 43:34.167
And you can say it.

43:34.375 --> 43:37.250
And customers too.
Only it's a coup.

43:37.458 --> 43:40.291
I had a dream
and woke up and tänkte-

43:40.501 --> 43:45.459
- I must make it my own
without forgetting its history.

43:45.876 --> 43:47.292
Suggested dream guy there?

43:47.501 --> 43:49.626
No.

43:49.833 --> 43:51.833
No, I just ... It was just me.

43:52.291 --> 43:55.208
Of course it was you.

43:55.416 --> 43:56.791
You can not trust men.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.333
They are unreliable, even in fantasies.

44:17.041 --> 44:19.541
- What do you do?
- What? The desire to share with you?

44:19.751 --> 44:24.292
Come on, stargazer,
otherwise we will sit all night.

44:24.501 --> 44:26.626
No, not all night.

44:26.833 --> 44:28.917
- I have plans.
- Me too.

44:29.125 --> 44:32.708
I know I do not have much of a life
outside this place, but ...

44:33.458 --> 44:34.958
Excuse me?

44:35.166 --> 44:37.083
- It is Jessa, heartthrob.
- No.

44:37.958 --> 44:39.750
Hello, Jessa. It's Joe.

44:39.958 --> 44:41.917
- Do not ...
- Yes. No, yeah, actually.

44:42.125 --> 44:44.751
- I watch all Nick calls.
- Hang up.

44:44.958 --> 44:47.583
Well, right now, Nick the manager.

44:47.791 --> 44:49.833
- It is good.
- Yes, he's on the rise.

44:50.041 --> 44:52.458
I'll tell you called? All right.

44:52.666 --> 44:54.208
Okay, bye-bye.

44:54.416 --> 44:55.875
- She's back.
- No.

44:56.083 --> 44:57.166
No no no.

44:57.375 --> 44:58.751
- Yes.
- No, listen.

44:58.958 --> 45:00.708
- Goddess Jessa.
- Gone.

45:00.918 --> 45:02.541
No.

45:03.333 --> 45:04.833
- Do not do it.
- Gone.

45:05.041 --> 45:06.541
- No.
- Gone.

45:06.751 --> 45:08.250
Not that, please.

45:08.458 --> 45:10.958
- We might retain it.
- Yes.

46:24.041 --> 46:25.375
Nick? Come in.

46:27.708 --> 46:29.375
Jessa?

46:30.918 --> 46:33.041
- What is it?
- A mouse.

46:34.708 --> 46:36.125
A what?

46:37.166 --> 46:40.126
Is that why you call in the middle of the night
and says it's an emergency?

46:40.208 --> 46:42.082
It's really great.

46:44.250 --> 46:46.583
It's over there.
Under the sink.

46:48.791 --> 46:50.541
I did not know who I would call.

46:50.751 --> 46:54.083
Why not call Bob or steak,
whatever his name was.

46:55.751 --> 46:57.083
Steak.

47:06.833 --> 47:09.000
It's a really big mouse.

47:11.208 --> 47:14.250
That may be a rat.

47:19.166 --> 47:20.416
Do not leave me.

47:30.583 --> 47:31.625
Hello?

47:35.501 --> 47:37.334
Hello?

47:49.166 --> 47:50.208
Hello?

47:51.626 --> 47:53.417
Hello?

47:54.375 --> 47:55.416
Where are you?

47:57.918 --> 47:59.000
Hello?

48:02.000 --> 48:03.041
Hello?

48:05.250 --> 48:07.125
Where are you?

48:18.791 --> 48:20.416
I made a mistake.

48:21.583 --> 48:24.125
I made a terrible mistake.

49:17.166 --> 49:20.041
You hit Jessa again.

49:20.250 --> 49:24.041
Have you put a GPS in my neck
so you can track me around the clock?

49:24.250 --> 49:27.501
I do not need a chip.
I have a mom radar.

49:27.708 --> 49:29.583
When I said you should dejta-

49:29.791 --> 49:32.958
- I did not mean with that
was unfaithful and broke your heart.

49:33.166 --> 49:36.875
I'm a big boy.
I have released it. You should too.

49:37.083 --> 49:38.375
- Please.
- Thanks.

49:38.583 --> 49:40.541
- Sure.
- How do you know that I met her?

49:40.751 --> 49:45.375
I saw it online. A photo of a rat
and her hero ex-boyfriend, Nick.

49:45.583 --> 49:48.708
So my mom's friend
with my ex-girlfriends.

49:48.918 --> 49:53.375
I accepted her friendship
when I thought she was human.

49:53.583 --> 49:56.583
They should keep your generation
away from the Internet.

49:56.791 --> 49:58.875
You do not look to have slept at all.

49:59.083 --> 50:03.125
Thanks, Sharla. I slept long enough to
realize that I do not want to live in a dream.

50:03.333 --> 50:07.208
I want to feel alive again,
I used to do.

50:07.416 --> 50:11.083
The restaurant is my moment.
I have to put a spin on it.

50:11.291 --> 50:13.918
I can not keep it
Mom's sake, but for my own.

50:14.125 --> 50:15.541
There she is.

50:15.751 --> 50:18.459
We pulled in twice as much last night
we made all week.

50:18.666 --> 50:21.416
I will continue to work with the recipes,
put my stamp on it-

50:21.626 --> 50:25.292
- Inserting it in the 2000s
and then maybe I can dating.

50:25.501 --> 50:28.250
My cousin Ellis still waiting.

50:31.958 --> 50:33.708
Hello, Mr. Taylor.

50:33.918 --> 50:36.918
Nick Smith. I'm working
on your project, with Beekman.

50:37.125 --> 50:42.541
I just wanted to introduce myself
and tell me that my partner and me

50:42.751 --> 50:46.459
- Here at the company, has boiled
together some innovative idéer-

50:46.666 --> 50:50.791
- Who can save the city money,
raise the environmental profile of a component

50:51.000 --> 50:53.375
And maybe get a tax credit.

50:53.583 --> 50:55.291
- Really?
- To be specific ...

50:55.501 --> 50:59.042
... I think we can incorporate
collecting rainwater

50:59.250 --> 51:02.876
- Sewage, recycling,
without much additional cost.

51:03.333 --> 51:05.833
Interesting.
I look forward to hearing more.

51:06.041 --> 51:07.041
Nick. Nick Smith.

51:07.250 --> 51:09.666
- George Taylor. Same to you.
- Nice to meet you.

51:20.583 --> 51:23.166
Jeez, it looks much better
without it, right?

51:24.958 --> 51:29.041
Oh, Mario. I thought we
should have the risotto as a special right tonight.

51:30.833 --> 51:34.791
Awesome. And after work,
I wondered if ...

51:35.501 --> 51:37.667
I'm not so good at this.

51:37.876 --> 51:40.667
Will you go out with me?

51:44.166 --> 51:45.541
All right.

51:51.041 --> 51:53.708
- How long did you talk to him?
- 20 minutes.

51:53.918 --> 51:56.209
Light 20 minutes.

51:56.416 --> 52:01.000
You will experience Beekman-
touch, but not in a good way.

52:01.791 --> 52:04.791
What's the point,
if we do not show up your feet?

52:05.000 --> 52:06.541
If you do not want to work here.

52:07.501 --> 52:09.542
Do not you think we should
few make ourselves heard?

52:09.751 --> 52:11.584
What happened to you?

52:16.791 --> 52:18.708
Hello, Jessa. It's Joe.

52:18.918 --> 52:21.541
How are you? What, do you want ...?

52:21.751 --> 52:23.709
- Hello.
- I just wanted to ...

52:26.751 --> 52:28.334
Tonight?

52:30.250 --> 52:32.958
If he wants to go back to Jessa,
it is his own affair.

52:33.166 --> 52:35.166
He needs to dating someone serious.

52:35.375 --> 52:37.166
Get married, have children, be happy.

52:37.375 --> 52:39.458
Mom says marriage
do not make you happy.

52:39.666 --> 52:43.583
Okay, it was a message
the authorization for my girls.

52:44.041 --> 52:46.500
Taken out of context,
let it probably ...

52:49.501 --> 52:53.834
Nick might avoid intimacy to ...
See on your perfect marriage.

52:54.041 --> 52:57.583
Can you blame him if he thinks
he can never get it.

52:58.958 --> 53:00.166
I hate broccoli.

53:00.375 --> 53:01.833
Sarah, no.

53:02.041 --> 53:04.750
Oops, prinsesstallriken
was not to you.

53:05.166 --> 53:09.250
It was the Princess
Tatiana of Morania.

53:09.626 --> 53:13.083
She is in town and always come here
our secret broccoli recipes.

53:13.291 --> 53:15.541
She says it makes
hair long and thick.

53:15.751 --> 53:17.417
- I'll take it.
- I'll keep it.

53:17.626 --> 53:19.125
All right.

53:21.291 --> 53:25.958
Excuse me. Are you in a relationship?
For I believe that you and my son ...

53:26.166 --> 53:27.625
Mom.

53:27.833 --> 53:29.750
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

53:29.958 --> 53:31.166
What?

53:31.375 --> 53:33.833
- She is wonderful.
- Seriously.

53:35.291 --> 53:36.541
Hold on.

53:36.751 --> 53:39.667
Are you saying that you turned down her?

53:39.876 --> 53:43.292
Liberty Jessa invading
my dreams in a chaste manner.

53:43.501 --> 53:46.083
I said I needed to get to sleep tonight.

53:46.291 --> 53:48.583
I wish I had your problems.

53:48.791 --> 53:52.750
Smith. My office, now.

53:58.166 --> 54:02.541
I'm just really surprised that you
discussed my project with the customer.

54:02.708 --> 54:05.208
You are here to draw.
If you have a problem with it-

54:05.416 --> 54:08.791
- Maybe you should find another job
that suits you better.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.166
Yes, sir, I hear you.

54:11.416 --> 54:18.458
And by the way, I really hope
your contribution to the competition is on your time.

54:18.708 --> 54:22.291
Yes. It is embarrassing to
a colleague in finalistjuryn-

54:22.501 --> 54:25.459
- Contact me
if your contribution to my firm.

54:27.666 --> 54:29.083
I am ...

54:29.291 --> 54:31.833
I'm sorry.
I should have told you ...

54:32.041 --> 54:34.208
- ... That I attend.
- Yes.

54:41.918 --> 54:43.584
I downloaded a drink.

54:44.208 --> 54:46.791
Is it ...? Is it limoncello?

54:47.708 --> 54:50.583
It tastes much better
in a efterrätt-

54:50.791 --> 54:52.541
-an in a drink.

54:54.751 --> 54:56.501
- Do you like to dance?
- Not directly ...

54:56.708 --> 54:59.583
- Come on.
- I like to dance alone.

55:12.918 --> 55:14.876
- Okay.
- Yes.

55:18.250 --> 55:22.041
- I ... I'm horrible at dancing.
- You're a very good dancer.

55:23.626 --> 55:26.501
- Okay.
- This is great.

55:57.791 --> 55:59.708
Natalie?

56:16.375 --> 56:17.541
Natalie!

56:53.166 --> 56:57.458
- You like kicks and jazz hands.
- I can no movement.

56:57.666 --> 56:59.875
- You sing.
- I'm trying.

57:00.125 --> 57:02.166
Yes, it makes you really.

57:02.375 --> 57:03.833
- You're a good dancer.
- No.

57:11.458 --> 57:12.875
All right.

57:15.041 --> 57:16.625
Natalia.

57:20.751 --> 57:24.709
- Not so bad, huh?
- No, not so bad.

57:26.708 --> 57:30.125
- Our mothers might was right.
- What do you mean?

57:30.541 --> 57:34.083
The last time your mother came to Italy
talked of our mothers.

57:34.291 --> 57:37.666
I heard them say:
"Mario and Natalia, is ..."

57:40.583 --> 57:44.208
- "They are made for each other."
- Did they say that?

57:54.958 --> 57:56.416
Good night.

58:04.918 --> 58:08.250
How long have you dreamed
this fictional person?

58:09.083 --> 58:10.626
Three nights.

58:10.833 --> 58:12.875
And then I missed one.

58:13.083 --> 58:17.291
And last night, she appeared not up ...

58:18.876 --> 58:21.209
I do not know.

58:21.416 --> 58:26.125
I found her
and made her disappear.

58:33.333 --> 58:38.250
I could hardly wait to go to sleep
to meet her.

58:38.458 --> 58:41.875
To be with her,
was fantastic.

58:42.291 --> 58:46.166
I was invulnerable.
I could do anything.

58:51.501 --> 58:53.584
You are really calm right now.

58:53.791 --> 58:56.208
That worries me.
I thought you would be angry.

58:56.416 --> 58:58.291
- I? No.
- Yes.

58:58.501 --> 59:02.250
Things you can not explain
happens every day.

59:02.458 --> 59:04.082
Yes.

59:04.958 --> 59:08.416
Yes, but you do not want
live in dreamland.

59:08.626 --> 59:10.959
If it's worth anything,
maybe you sheepmeat

59:11.166 --> 59:13.833
- A price in the weekend,
in this real world.

59:14.833 --> 59:17.666
I'm not so sure that it will be so.

59:21.583 --> 59:23.082
60 percent in the evening.

59:23.291 --> 59:26.500
Any changes you have made
really worth.

59:26.708 --> 59:29.500
One feels almost back instead.

59:29.708 --> 59:33.625
You should call the TV restaurant critic.

59:33.833 --> 59:37.082
It is not a bad idea.
Maybe when the menu is in order.

59:37.291 --> 59:40.833
Are you okay?
Some good dreams lately?

59:41.041 --> 59:44.333
No, I hardly slept last night.
I was out with Mario yesterday.

59:44.541 --> 59:48.625
We danced, if you can imagine it.

59:49.708 --> 59:54.708
You know how it is said
Dissolving things in their dreams?

59:55.208 --> 59:59.082
Dream guy maybe your way of
show yourself that you could go on.

59:59.291 --> 01:00:00.875
And you did.

01:00:01.083 --> 01:00:02.791
Good for you.

01:00:04.291 --> 01:00:06.791
- Hello. Welcome to Russo's.
- Hello.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.416
Just three? In this direction.

01:00:09.626 --> 01:00:10.667
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:00:14.791 --> 01:00:17.083
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:00:20.708 --> 01:00:25.041
I thought you said that we
would eat at home tonight?

01:00:26.375 --> 01:00:30.291
You know I'm not laws
food, so we're going out.

01:00:30.501 --> 01:00:34.626
I've had a really tough day.
I'm tired.

01:00:35.918 --> 01:00:39.166
The clock is 19:00, so ...

01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:42.166
It was bedtime long time ago for you.

01:00:46.666 --> 01:00:49.750
Okay, pick a place. We can go out.

01:00:49.958 --> 01:00:52.208
Thank you.

01:00:56.583 --> 01:00:58.333
Have you been here before?

01:00:58.541 --> 01:01:00.083
It is new.

01:01:05.458 --> 01:01:08.666
Six new just arrived. We are almost
crammed. What should I do?

01:01:08.876 --> 01:01:11.209
I'll help you.
Give me a couple of minutes only.

01:01:12.666 --> 01:01:13.918
- Download.
- Excuse me.

01:01:14.125 --> 01:01:16.208
I can cook. I can cook.

01:01:16.416 --> 01:01:19.041
All right. Thank you, Damien.

01:01:21.791 --> 01:01:25.250
- Hello. Welcome to Russo's Italian.
- Thanks.

01:01:25.458 --> 01:01:27.000
For two. Do you have anything?

01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:29.583
The last table. This way.

01:01:38.791 --> 01:01:41.458
- Thanks.
- Please.

01:01:42.125 --> 01:01:45.751
- Do you want to start with something to drink?
- Yes.

01:01:46.501 --> 01:01:48.751
- Thanks.
- I take a pinot.

01:01:48.958 --> 01:01:51.416
Wonderful choice.

01:01:51.626 --> 01:01:53.042
Same for me. Thank you.

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:54.791
All right.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.458
Wait, we should ...?

01:01:56.666 --> 01:01:58.750
- Should we order?
- Yes.

01:01:58.958 --> 01:02:01.750
We should probably order.
You seem really busy.

01:02:03.416 --> 01:02:05.208
You can order well for me?

01:02:05.416 --> 01:02:07.208
Now I feel stressed.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.041
She takes anatra ...

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:17.626
- Okay.
- ... And I will take the lamb.

01:02:18.208 --> 01:02:20.333
Perfect. Thank you.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.375
If you add the broccoli, please.

01:02:24.583 --> 01:02:26.000
Yes.

01:02:26.416 --> 01:02:27.750
Thank you.

01:02:27.958 --> 01:02:29.250
You hate broccoli.

01:02:30.626 --> 01:02:33.000
Maybe I'm a changed man.

01:02:40.501 --> 01:02:41.918
Nick.

01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:44.666
Nick. Come on, please.

01:02:48.833 --> 01:02:50.125
For a fresh start?

01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:54.666
Yes. A fresh start.

01:02:55.918 --> 01:02:57.541
Cheers.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.791
I'm thinking of leaving Beekman.

01:03:09.583 --> 01:03:12.666
- Are you going to leave Beekman?
- Yes.

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:15.292
It would mean
to be out on their own.

01:03:15.918 --> 01:03:18.334
Or with Joe if he wants to.

01:03:19.501 --> 01:03:22.042
You mean really seriously.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.833
It does not feel like the right time to take risks.

01:03:26.416 --> 01:03:28.083
Why not?

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:31.708
Right, I have not even told.

01:03:31.918 --> 01:03:35.250
I am a finalist in the city brotävling.

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:37.501
- Really?
- Yes.

01:03:37.708 --> 01:03:41.958
Oh my God. Congratulations.
Is it a large cash prize or ...?

01:03:42.166 --> 01:03:45.750
No, it is more about prestige.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:49.083
So there is no money?

01:03:51.166 --> 01:03:57.416
No, but, I mean, if I win
people will take notice of me.

01:03:57.626 --> 01:04:00.709
- And maybe I can ...
- Maybe you should wait until you win.

01:04:00.918 --> 01:04:03.416
Then we can talk about
that you should leave the Beekman.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:07.626
Yes.

01:04:09.041 --> 01:04:12.458
- Yes.
- I did not mean that.

01:04:16.833 --> 01:04:18.666
Give me a second.

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:58.375
Oh, God ...
Clean up only, Damien.

01:04:58.583 --> 01:05:02.583
Sharla, which table should anatran
and lamb with broccoli to?

01:05:03.083 --> 01:05:05.125
- Table nine.
- Hot!

01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:08.583
- Hot!
- Download.

01:05:13.918 --> 01:05:17.041
- Okay, anatra.
- Thanks.

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:19.125
Would you like some pepper?

01:05:19.333 --> 01:05:21.958
- Not for myself, but for my boyfriend.
- Okay.

01:05:23.501 --> 01:05:26.834
Say to. All right.

01:05:27.041 --> 01:05:30.333
He likes a lot of pepper. Thank you.

01:05:33.751 --> 01:05:35.000
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry.

01:05:35.208 --> 01:05:36.583
Are you okay?

01:05:43.333 --> 01:05:44.958
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.

01:05:50.375 --> 01:05:52.458
This looks good.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.501
Nick?

01:06:04.083 --> 01:06:05.584
Table Three.

01:06:19.125 --> 01:06:20.375
Nick?

01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:22.082
Natalia.

01:06:29.166 --> 01:06:30.918
Nick, what is it?

01:06:34.416 --> 01:06:39.041
Yeah, I just ...
I was looking for pepper.

01:06:40.751 --> 01:06:44.459
Seriously, you and your pepper ...

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.791
- What is it?
- Who was sitting here?

01:07:11.626 --> 01:07:13.417
Lamb-and-broccoli-guy.

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:16.876
- Broccoli?
- Yes.

01:07:17.083 --> 01:07:20.125
You saw him, right?
And the girl he was here with?

01:07:34.833 --> 01:07:36.833
Are you looking for him?

01:07:37.958 --> 01:07:39.625
The man of your dreams?

01:07:41.666 --> 01:07:43.083
Hold on.

01:07:43.751 --> 01:07:46.167
You are the woman who sells flowers?

01:07:47.416 --> 01:07:51.166
- What are you doing here?
- I come here when I can not sleep.

01:07:51.666 --> 01:07:57.500
I saw my true love
in my dreams for seven nights in a row.

01:07:58.458 --> 01:08:00.000
That is how the legend is working.

01:08:01.083 --> 01:08:03.918
- What legend?
- Hayward fountain.

01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:06.291
Legend has it that throwing a coin

01:08:06.501 --> 01:08:10.709
- And seven nights dreaming man
of his true love.

01:08:11.541 --> 01:08:14.125
And if you really love him,

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:18.041
- Will stones spirits
to make him real.

01:08:19.292 --> 01:08:21.000
It is ...

01:08:21.207 --> 01:08:22.541
It is pure fantasy.

01:08:26.332 --> 01:08:28.416
Did it happen to you?

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.582
Take my advice.

01:08:30.792 --> 01:08:35.375
Find yourself a real guy
and save yourself the pain.

01:09:36.876 --> 01:09:40.250
During a short period of time,
found beaver water

01:09:40.457 --> 01:09:42.832
-skapade ponds and found frid-

01:09:43.042 --> 01:09:46.292
-in a dangerous and tough ecosystems.

01:10:01.417 --> 01:10:03.042
Hello?

01:10:04.292 --> 01:10:06.042
Hello.

01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:10.584
Did not think I ever
would see you again.

01:10:11.292 --> 01:10:13.000
Here I am.

01:10:14.167 --> 01:10:16.042
Must be fate.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.082
Really? Do you believe in destiny?

01:10:19.792 --> 01:10:22.375
I'll find you, again and again.

01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:26.626
Yes. And it feels right
When I'm with you.

01:10:26.833 --> 01:10:27.876
Right?

01:10:28.082 --> 01:10:33.583
It feels like I
can do what I want.

01:10:33.792 --> 01:10:38.918
- I can win brotävlingen.
- Or as I can ride me ...

01:10:39.125 --> 01:10:41.082
... And restore my family's restaurant.

01:10:41.292 --> 01:10:42.751
Just.

01:10:43.626 --> 01:10:45.083
What more can I ask?

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:49.626
- Something real.
- But it is real, somehow.

01:10:49.833 --> 01:10:52.876
It's just ... not fair.

01:10:53.501 --> 01:10:54.833
Same thing again.

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:58.876
Another night where we just go round and round.

01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:02.542
I'm tired of this.

01:11:03.833 --> 01:11:08.791
It is unrealistic. The more I see you
the harder it becomes.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.583
- But you said it feels so good.
- Yes I did.

01:11:11.792 --> 01:11:14.209
But that is only an illusion, okay?

01:11:14.876 --> 01:11:19.375
Even if the legend is true ...

01:11:20.082 --> 01:11:22.000
We only have one more night.

01:11:22.208 --> 01:11:24.833
- What legend?
- Seven nights ...

01:11:25.042 --> 01:11:28.542
... Seven chances to dream of you,
then it's over.

01:11:28.876 --> 01:11:31.000
Okay, but it is not over. Not yet.

01:11:32.792 --> 01:11:35.042
Hoping helps nothing.

01:11:35.501 --> 01:11:39.501
- Stop. I wake up when we touch each other.
- Exactly.

01:11:40.583 --> 01:11:45.125
You're all I ever dreamed,
but you are not.

01:11:45.333 --> 01:11:47.708
Why do I go through this?
I must move on.

01:11:47.917 --> 01:11:49.500
- Stop.
- No, I must go on.

01:11:49.708 --> 01:11:52.833
Do not look for me tomorrow.
I will not sleep.

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:56.083
What if you're wrong?
What if we can find each other?

01:11:57.417 --> 01:12:00.083
- You are not real.
- Natalie.

01:12:29.375 --> 01:12:30.917
Jessa?

01:12:31.125 --> 01:12:35.000
No, just a reminder for
award ceremony on Saturday night.

01:12:37.667 --> 01:12:40.459
This is our chance.

01:12:41.292 --> 01:12:44.709
Although there is
there is a future in which out-

01:12:44.917 --> 01:12:48.416
- Which does not have to include
Lance Beekman, because I'm completion

01:12:48.626 --> 01:12:50.417
-with make tråkgörat.

01:12:51.082 --> 01:12:56.708
If I leave now,
and choose to become self-

01:12:56.917 --> 01:12:58.625
-följer you with me?

01:13:04.167 --> 01:13:05.501
Are you ...?

01:13:05.708 --> 01:13:07.791
Have you any idea what it takes?

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.626
To arrange customers, provide office,
hiring employees?

01:13:10.833 --> 01:13:13.416
- Pay ... Pay the Bills?
- I know. I know.

01:13:13.626 --> 01:13:17.417
It will be tough, but if I win,
it will generate interest.

01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:19.792
- Do you expect that?
- We will be crushed.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.792
Competition on price is enormous.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.167
- So you do not think I can win.
- That said, I do not.

01:13:27.667 --> 01:13:30.250
I need the papers in the office.

01:13:32.583 --> 01:13:33.958
All right.

01:13:34.167 --> 01:13:36.167
Let me ask this:

01:13:37.292 --> 01:13:38.375
Do you like it here?

01:13:38.583 --> 01:13:45.541
Do you enjoy giving everything you have
to perfect Beekman-touch?

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:52.833
- Yablonski, Smith and co-workers.
- No no.

01:13:53.833 --> 01:13:56.708
Smith, Yablonski, so you get to be with.

01:13:59.208 --> 01:14:00.291
Yes.

01:14:06.958 --> 01:14:08.333
- Damien?
- Yes.

01:14:08.542 --> 01:14:11.876
I have hired a new busboy,
so you get to be Deputy Director tonight.

01:14:12.626 --> 01:14:15.208
- Serious?
- Then you must listen to me.

01:14:15.876 --> 01:14:20.792
Now we run all weekend, and I
just want to say how grateful I am.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:24.625
Very good.

01:14:25.208 --> 01:14:28.876
- Grandpa, can we get a cookie?
- What? A cake?

01:14:29.082 --> 01:14:31.541
Sure, you get a cookie.
We go and find them.

01:14:31.751 --> 01:14:34.208
Where are they? Oh, cakes.

01:14:34.417 --> 01:14:35.459
Hey, hey.

01:14:35.667 --> 01:14:37.667
- Uncle Nick.
- Uncle Nick.

01:14:38.833 --> 01:14:39.958
Here they are.

01:14:40.167 --> 01:14:41.626
Hello.

01:14:42.250 --> 01:14:44.042
Glad to see you.

01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:46.917
Jessa, good to see you.

01:14:47.917 --> 01:14:49.125
Mr. Smith.

01:14:49.333 --> 01:14:51.166
Mike, do you remember?

01:14:51.375 --> 01:14:52.833
Do you remember those two?

01:14:53.042 --> 01:14:55.918
Hannah and Sarah,
you have been so long.

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:58.208
We eat broccoli now.

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.042
Congratulations on the wedding, Charlotte.

01:15:07.667 --> 01:15:09.083
Mrs Smith.

01:15:09.292 --> 01:15:10.792
Thanks, Jessa.

01:15:14.792 --> 01:15:16.751
Remember to keep the floor dry.

01:15:17.626 --> 01:15:20.792
- Got that? In this direction.
- Everything okay for tonight?

01:15:21.667 --> 01:15:25.042
- I know. Classico Italiano with a twist.
- Okay.

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:28.708
Twist, twist. I give you
more twist than a pretzel, huh?

01:15:40.667 --> 01:15:42.626
Do not be mad at me.

01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:44.792
It does not sound good.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.958
It can be good.

01:15:47.167 --> 01:15:48.792
Okay, spit it out.

01:15:50.208 --> 01:15:54.501
I called the TV station and
urged food critic to dine here.

01:15:54.708 --> 01:15:56.291
- Rodney Sims?
- We're ready, Nat.

01:15:56.501 --> 01:16:00.708
If he hates us he digs us down
in a deep hole that we can not get out.

01:16:00.917 --> 01:16:03.125
No, he can not.

01:16:03.333 --> 01:16:05.501
This is your dream, Nat.

01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:08.291
And it's so good for you.

01:16:08.501 --> 01:16:12.417
The restaurant and Mario.

01:16:18.082 --> 01:16:21.250
I raise my glass to my bride.

01:16:25.417 --> 01:16:27.334
Charlotte, my beloved älskling-

01:16:27.542 --> 01:16:31.709
- You are just as beautiful today
the first day we met.

01:16:33.208 --> 01:16:35.000
40 years of happiness.

01:16:35.208 --> 01:16:37.501
- I was a child-bride.
- I know right.

01:16:39.042 --> 01:16:41.501
- Grandpa kisses grandmother again.
- They do that sometimes.

01:16:41.708 --> 01:16:44.082
I was scarred for a long time ago
the sight.

01:16:44.292 --> 01:16:46.626
Casanova, toddlers watching.

01:16:46.833 --> 01:16:48.501
- Stop.
- No, you can stop.

01:16:48.708 --> 01:16:52.833
- Sarah.
- Girls. You and you, outside. Come now.

01:16:53.042 --> 01:16:54.962
- Give them no attention.
- Now you did it.

01:16:55.042 --> 01:16:56.667
You emptied the room.

01:16:56.876 --> 01:16:59.542
You know what keeps me, Nick?
At my age?

01:16:59.751 --> 01:17:02.125
- What?
- The heart.

01:17:02.876 --> 01:17:07.167
Without the heart, there is no passion.
No passion, no life.

01:17:07.375 --> 01:17:10.626
And I thank my luck
that Charlotte is my passion-

01:17:10.833 --> 01:17:13.416
-My heart and my life.

01:17:15.042 --> 01:17:16.834
May you all find the same.

01:17:21.667 --> 01:17:24.250
It's about time. Happy birthday.

01:17:24.458 --> 01:17:25.876
- Congratulations on the wedding day.
- Thanks.

01:17:26.082 --> 01:17:28.666
Congratulations on the wedding day.

01:17:30.501 --> 01:17:31.751
Thank you, darling.

01:17:31.958 --> 01:17:33.541
Here you are.

01:17:35.292 --> 01:17:37.375
Can I interfere?

01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:41.375
You always interfere.
We know that about you.

01:17:41.583 --> 01:17:44.876
Your sister says
To avoid tying you-

01:17:45.082 --> 01:17:49.208
- Because you think you can not get
the relationship your father and I have.

01:17:49.417 --> 01:17:52.042
Mom, you and Dad have
is astounding.

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:55.458
I would love to have it so one day,
but I have not had the luck.

01:17:55.667 --> 01:17:59.250
Then you wait.
But do not settle for less.

01:17:59.458 --> 01:18:02.917
You have dreamed of the girl,
now you have to go out and find her.

01:18:03.125 --> 01:18:05.667
- You will not find fantasies.
- It was not what I meant.

01:18:05.876 --> 01:18:07.208
Do not be so literal.

01:18:07.417 --> 01:18:10.834
We have the old Hayward legend.

01:18:11.042 --> 01:18:13.667
You may be able
dream up a looker.

01:18:13.876 --> 01:18:16.083
- Excuse me?
- Do not listen to your father.

01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:18.042
- He thinks he's funny.
- You know ...

01:18:18.250 --> 01:18:20.667
... The legend of Hayward Fountain.

01:18:20.876 --> 01:18:23.167
People throw coins in fontänen-

01:18:23.375 --> 01:18:26.583
- And then they dream about
their true love for seven nights.

01:18:26.792 --> 01:18:28.834
Is it not so?

01:18:30.501 --> 01:18:33.292
If you can dream it, you can get it.

01:18:33.501 --> 01:18:35.918
Take the plunge.

01:18:37.167 --> 01:18:38.709
Thank you.

01:18:38.917 --> 01:18:40.791
But I'm not going to chase after a dream.

01:18:47.375 --> 01:18:49.583
As food critic, Rodney Sims-

01:18:49.792 --> 01:18:53.083
- Appears well just up,
without warning?

01:18:53.292 --> 01:18:54.667
Yes, unfortunately.

01:19:06.417 --> 01:19:10.000
Appeared dream boy up last night?

01:19:10.208 --> 01:19:11.583
No.

01:19:12.167 --> 01:19:15.083
I do not dream about
the impossible anymore.

01:20:37.542 --> 01:20:40.501
Mr Beekman,
This is not working.

01:20:40.708 --> 01:20:44.250
You have talent, but there are
something called rightful share.

01:20:44.458 --> 01:20:46.666
I've been here for three years.

01:20:46.876 --> 01:20:49.436
Do you know how long it took for me
to get my big break?

01:20:49.583 --> 01:20:51.250
No, but you know what I know?

01:20:51.458 --> 01:20:55.125
That it is time for me to get out
my name and my designs.

01:20:55.626 --> 01:20:59.626
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but it will not happen here.

01:21:00.375 --> 01:21:01.958
I know.

01:21:10.501 --> 01:21:12.751
She would be proud of
what you accomplished.

01:21:12.958 --> 01:21:15.833
Yes, I think so too.

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:22.626
I was awake all night yesterday
so that I would not dream.

01:21:22.833 --> 01:21:24.416
Why?

01:21:27.333 --> 01:21:29.125
We got seven nights.

01:21:29.333 --> 01:21:32.082
Seven nights to dream,
and now it's over.

01:21:32.292 --> 01:21:34.334
It's over.

01:21:35.082 --> 01:21:36.791
It is already queued.

01:21:37.333 --> 01:21:38.708
All right.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.833
Nick. Did not you get my mess?
We would eat breakfast together.

01:21:53.042 --> 01:21:54.626
I waited.

01:21:55.792 --> 01:21:57.626
What happens?

01:21:58.958 --> 01:22:01.375
I quit.

01:22:01.626 --> 01:22:05.000
The expression on the face Beekmans
when I told? Priceless.

01:22:07.292 --> 01:22:10.542
Have you stopped?
Would not you wait for the award?

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:14.417
Why are not you happy for me?

01:22:15.042 --> 01:22:17.167
I stopped because I wanted to.

01:22:17.375 --> 01:22:19.667
I needed to do
a big change in my life.

01:22:19.876 --> 01:22:22.958
But what if you do not win?
And you said that there is no prize money.

01:22:23.167 --> 01:22:26.876
- It's not about money.
- I can not believe you said you up.

01:22:27.375 --> 01:22:30.292
Do not do that. Not now.

01:22:32.833 --> 01:22:35.041
I just want what's best for you.

01:22:36.042 --> 01:22:38.334
What is best for us.

01:22:50.417 --> 01:22:54.042
I'm sorry. Your table is ready
for a few minutes, I promise.

01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:56.876
- Jamie, can you hurry?
- Yes. All right.

01:22:57.082 --> 01:22:59.416
I ask again so awful
very sorry.

01:23:01.542 --> 01:23:04.209
- Natalie, you're needed here.
- Okay, I will.

01:23:04.417 --> 01:23:06.792
Mario, was the gnocchi to table four?

01:23:09.501 --> 01:23:11.542
- Grab it.
- I dropped the pasta.

01:23:11.751 --> 01:23:13.876
My finest plate.
Excuse me.

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:15.876
I dropped it almost.

I look forward to the "wonderful".
The bill is on me.

01:24:02.417 --> 01:24:04.876
OK good. Then we will arrange it.

01:24:08.417 --> 01:24:10.626

- Yes, I'm okay.

01:24:22.292 --> 01:24:23.834
I feel good.

01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:27.666
- Are you okay?
- Oh yes.

01:24:32.626 --> 01:24:35.083
- No, Nat, I would never ...
- No no no.

01:24:35.292 --> 01:24:37.584
Sharla, it's perfect. I ...

01:24:38.167 --> 01:24:40.792
I have tried to find the feeling of ...

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.792
I did not want to hurt you, Mario.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.792
- What's he saying?
- Chemistry. We have no personal chemistry.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.250
No spark.

01:24:54.458 --> 01:24:57.166
However, Natalia, you are
a very close friend.

01:24:57.375 --> 01:24:59.125
Yes, of course.

01:24:59.833 --> 01:25:01.501
I must do something.

01:25:01.708 --> 01:25:04.583
Wait, Nat.
Rodney Sims are here.

01:25:04.792 --> 01:25:06.000
- Is he?
- Is he?

01:25:06.208 --> 01:25:08.416
- Yes.
- How did I miss that?

01:25:08.958 --> 01:25:13.166
- I have to go. You solve it.
- You can not go. You need to be here.

01:25:13.375 --> 01:25:18.000
If I do not try to find him
I will forever regret it.

It is best that you win.

01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:04.042
Sorry. I can not do this.

01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:06.876
I thought it would
be different. Sorry.
