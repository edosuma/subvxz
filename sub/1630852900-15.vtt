>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:35.835 --> 00:38.772
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:38.838 --> 00:39.305
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:39.372 --> 00:40.073
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:40.140 --> 00:41.841
US.

00:41.908 --> 00:42.909
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.043
THE U.S. ENTERED A BEAR MARKET.

00:44.110 --> 00:44.677
THERE WAS HISTORIC FLOODING IN

00:44.744 --> 00:45.545
YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK.

00:45.612 --> 00:46.613
AND IN PERU, A HEARING

00:46.679 --> 00:47.680
CONCERNING A CORRUPTION INQUIRY

00:47.747 --> 00:52.419
INTO THEIR PRESIDENT WAS

00:52.485 --> 00:53.319
DISRUPTED IN A TRULY SPECTACULAR

00:53.386 --> 00:54.287
WAY.

00:54.354 --> 00:55.088
>> WHAT THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S

00:55.155 --> 00:57.957
OFFICE IS INVESTIGATING IS --

00:58.024 --> 01:02.262
[SPEAKING NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE]

01:02.328 --> 01:05.298
>> THE GENTLEMAN THERE IS

01:05.365 --> 01:05.965
INTERFERENCE FROM WHAT SEEMS TO

01:06.032 --> 01:10.103
BE THE LAW FIRM SHOWING VERY

01:10.170 --> 01:11.104
SUGGESTIVE IMAGES.

01:11.171 --> 01:14.507
[LAUGHTER]

01:14.574 --> 01:16.543
>> John: WOW, THAT'S A LITTLE

01:16.609 --> 01:17.444
MORE THAN SUGGESTIVE IMAGES.

01:17.510 --> 01:18.244
A SUGGESTIVE IMAGE IS THE

01:18.311 --> 01:19.145
ENTICING HINT OF WHAT LIES

01:19.212 --> 01:20.113
BENEATH.

01:20.180 --> 01:20.980
THAT'S STRAIGHT UP DICK.

01:21.047 --> 01:21.981
THAT'S A WHOLE DICK ON THE TV IN

01:22.048 --> 01:24.083
PERU.

01:24.150 --> 01:25.251
[LAUGHTER]

01:25.318 --> 01:26.319
BUT INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THAT,

01:26.386 --> 01:27.253
WE'RE GOING TO CONCENTRATE ON

01:27.320 --> 01:28.321
THE U.S., WHERE THE HOUSE

01:28.388 --> 01:29.322
COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING JANUARY

01:29.389 --> 01:30.523
6TH CONTINUED TO UNEARTH NEW

01:30.590 --> 01:31.424
DETAILS REGARDING THE DAYS

01:31.491 --> 01:33.193
LEADING UP TO THE INSURRECTION,

01:33.259 --> 01:34.427
INCLUDING THE SURPRISINGLY LARGE

01:34.494 --> 01:35.495
ROLE OF TRUMP'S LEGAL ADVISER,

01:35.562 --> 01:38.264
JOHN EASTMAN.

01:38.331 --> 01:39.599
AND QUICK SIDENOTE: IF YOU'RE

01:39.666 --> 01:41.434
EVER ACCUSED OF A CRIME AND YOUR

01:41.501 --> 01:42.435
LAWYER SHOWS UP TO COURT DRESSED

01:42.502 --> 01:43.536
LIKE THIS, YOU ARE GOING TO

01:43.603 --> 01:44.404
JAIL.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.439
[LAUGHTER]

01:46.506 --> 01:47.841
EASTMAN WAS THE ONE WHO DEVISED

01:47.907 --> 01:49.309
THE THEORY THAT MIKE PENCE COULD

01:49.375 --> 01:50.910
SINGLE-HANDEDLY NEGATE THE

01:50.977 --> 01:52.479
ELECTION RESULTS, A THEORY THAT

01:52.545 --> 01:53.780
WAS MET WITH AN APPROPRIATE

01:53.847 --> 01:55.215
LEVEL OF SKEPTICISM AT THE TIME

01:55.281 --> 01:58.384
FROM THIS WHITE HOUSE LAWYER.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.486
>> I SAID, HOLD ON A SECOND, I

01:59.552 --> 02:00.653
WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

02:00.720 --> 02:01.821
SAYING.

02:01.888 --> 02:03.289
YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU BELIEVE

02:03.356 --> 02:05.725
THE VICE PRESIDENT ACTING AS

02:05.792 --> 02:07.160
PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE CAN BE

02:07.227 --> 02:08.895
THE SOLE DECISION MAKER AS TO,

02:08.962 --> 02:09.929
UNDER YOUR THEORY, WHO BECOMES

02:09.996 --> 02:10.964
THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

02:11.030 --> 02:13.566
STATES?

02:13.633 --> 02:16.669
AND HE SAID "YES."

02:16.736 --> 02:17.604
I SAID, ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR

02:17.670 --> 02:19.105
F-ING MIND?

02:19.172 --> 02:20.406
>> John: RIGHT.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.275
ALTHOUGH, I WILL SAY, AT THIS

02:22.342 --> 02:25.278
POINT, YOU CAN JUST SAY "FUCK."

02:25.345 --> 02:26.279
[LAUGHTER]

02:26.346 --> 02:27.146
DEMOCRACY IS HANGING ON BY A

02:27.213 --> 02:28.014
THREAD, AND YOU HAD A FRONT ROW

02:28.081 --> 02:28.948
SEAT.

02:29.015 --> 02:29.949
YOU CAN SAY "FUCK."

02:30.016 --> 02:30.783
YOU SAID IT THEN AND YOU SHOULD

02:30.850 --> 02:31.684
SAY IT NOW.

02:31.751 --> 02:32.719
BECAUSE WHAT HE WAS SUGGESTING

02:32.785 --> 02:34.120
TO YOU THERE WAS BONKERS.

02:34.187 --> 02:35.622
THE IDEA THAT A SINGLE PERSON

02:35.688 --> 02:37.323
COULD DECIDE THE PRESIDENCY IS

02:37.390 --> 02:39.292
COMPLETELY AGAINST THE IDEALS OF

02:39.359 --> 02:40.927
THIS COUNTRY, WHICH IS WHY THE

02:40.994 --> 02:43.029
CONSTITUTION STARTS WITH "WE THE

02:43.096 --> 02:44.297
PEOPLE" AND NOT "MIKE."

02:44.364 --> 02:46.466
[LAUGHTER]

02:46.533 --> 02:47.567
ALSO, I KNOW IT'S NOT THE

02:47.634 --> 02:48.668
IMPORTANT THING, BUT WHAT IS

02:48.735 --> 02:51.204
HAPPENING BEHIND THAT MAN?

02:51.271 --> 02:52.205
[LAUGHTER]

02:52.272 --> 02:53.273
WHY DOES THIS BAT HAVE "JUSTICE"

02:53.339 --> 02:56.209
WRITTEN ON IT?

02:56.276 --> 02:57.076
AND WHAT ARE THESE THREE METAL

02:57.143 --> 02:58.478
WIG THINGS RIGHT BELOW IT?

02:58.545 --> 02:59.579
DO YOU WEAR THEM?

02:59.646 --> 03:00.713
OR DID YOU SEE ONE OF THOSE GUYS

03:00.780 --> 03:01.681
PAINTED SILVER WHO MOVES WHEN

03:01.748 --> 03:02.348
YOU GIVE HIM MONEY AND SCALP

03:02.415 --> 03:05.118
HIM?

03:05.184 --> 03:06.586
ALSO THAT PANDA PAINTING, AND

03:06.653 --> 03:08.187
THIS IS TRUE, WAS APPARENTLY

03:08.254 --> 03:09.088
FEATURED IN THE "FIFTY SHADES OF

03:09.155 --> 03:13.126
GREY" MOVIE.

03:13.192 --> 03:16.729
IT IS ALL VERY WEIRD!

03:16.796 --> 03:17.497
I WOULD SAY IT'S THE MOST

03:17.564 --> 03:18.398
DISTRACTING VISUALS DURING A

03:18.464 --> 03:22.368
TELEVISED GOVERNMENT HEARING,

03:22.435 --> 03:25.338
BUT AS WE ALL KNOW, PERU HAS

03:25.405 --> 03:26.272
SIGNIFICANTLY RAISED THE BAR IN

03:26.339 --> 03:27.273
THAT REGARD.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.107
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, THE POINT OF

03:28.174 --> 03:29.242
THESE HEARINGS IS TO LEARN

03:29.309 --> 03:30.443
LESSONS FROM THE EFFORTS TO

03:30.510 --> 03:31.110
STEAL THE LAST ELECTION, TO

03:31.177 --> 03:32.011
PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

03:32.078 --> 03:33.046
BUT FOR MANY REPUBLICANS, IT

03:33.112 --> 03:34.681
SEEMS THE ONLY MISTAKE THEY SEE

03:34.747 --> 03:35.248
IS THAT THEY DIDN'T GO FAR

03:35.315 --> 03:35.915
ENOUGH.

03:35.982 --> 03:37.183
BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A

03:37.250 --> 03:38.184
MIDTERM ELECTION YEAR RIGHT NOW,

03:38.251 --> 03:39.185
AND ALREADY, MORE THAN A

03:39.252 --> 03:40.820
HUNDRED REPUBLICAN PRIMARY

03:40.887 --> 03:41.688
WINNERS BACK TRUMP'S FALSE

03:41.754 --> 03:43.056
CLAIMS OF ELECTION FRAUD.

03:43.122 --> 03:44.357
AN ESPECIALLY CONCERNING

03:44.424 --> 03:45.458
SUBSET ARE CANDIDATES FOR

03:45.525 --> 03:47.026
SECRETARY OF STATE, BECAUSE THEY

03:47.093 --> 03:48.761
COULD END UP IN A POSITION TO

03:48.828 --> 03:49.696
DIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE NEXT

03:49.762 --> 03:51.764
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.533
TAKE JIM MARCHANT, WHO LOOKS

03:53.600 --> 03:55.535
LIKE WHAT A CHILD WOULD PRODUCE

03:55.602 --> 03:56.269
IF YOU SIMPLY TOLD THEM TO "DRAW

03:56.336 --> 03:57.837
BUSINESS."

03:57.904 --> 03:59.572
[LAUGHTER]

03:59.639 --> 04:01.074
ON TUESDAY, MARCHANT BECAME THE

04:01.140 --> 04:01.941
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY

04:02.008 --> 04:03.576
OF STATE IN NEVADA.

04:03.643 --> 04:04.811
WHICH IS ALARMING, GIVEN THAT

04:04.877 --> 04:05.778
HE'S A CONSPIRACY THEORIST WHO'S

04:05.845 --> 04:08.181
SAID THINGS LIKE THIS:

04:08.247 --> 04:10.016
>> THE SHAPE THAT OUR COUNTRY IS

04:10.083 --> 04:10.917
IN RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE OF

04:10.984 --> 04:12.585
ELECTION FRAUD.

04:12.652 --> 04:15.088
THE PEOPLE OF NEVADA HAVE NOT

04:15.154 --> 04:16.589
ELECTED ANYBODY SINCE 2006,

04:16.656 --> 04:18.257
THEY'VE BEEN INSTALLED BY THE

04:18.324 --> 04:19.726
DEEP STATE CABAL.

04:19.792 --> 04:21.160
>> John: WOW.

04:21.227 --> 04:22.962
"THE PEOPLE OF NEVADA HAVEN'T

04:23.029 --> 04:25.131
LEGITIMATELY ELECTED ANYBODY

04:25.198 --> 04:27.100
SINCE 2006."

04:27.166 --> 04:29.302
THAT IS A PRETTY BOLD CLAIM,

04:29.369 --> 04:30.370
ESPECIALLY COMING FROM A GUY WHO

04:30.436 --> 04:31.704
HIMSELF WAS ELECTED TO THE STATE

04:31.771 --> 04:33.239
ASSEMBLY THERE IN 2016.

04:33.306 --> 04:34.841
[LAUGHTER]

04:34.907 --> 04:36.943
ALSO, WHEN MARCHANT WAS ASKED TO

04:37.010 --> 04:38.344
SPECIFY WHO, EXACTLY, HE THOUGHT

04:38.411 --> 04:41.214
WAS STEALING ELECTIONS, HE SAID,

04:41.280 --> 04:42.649
"I DON'T KNOW, ACTUALLY.

04:42.715 --> 04:43.983
I THINK IT'S A GLOBAL THING.

04:44.050 --> 04:44.550
THE PEOPLE IN POWER WANT TO

04:44.617 --> 04:46.285
MAINTAIN THEIR POWER."

04:46.352 --> 04:47.153
WHICH IS HONESTLY PRETTY

04:47.220 --> 04:47.920
REFRESHING COMING FROM A

04:47.987 --> 04:50.256
CONSPIRACY THEORIST.

04:50.323 --> 04:51.324
"LOOK, WE KNOW THERE'S A SECRET

04:51.391 --> 04:52.425
CABAL PULLING THE STRINGS OF

04:52.492 --> 04:53.526
POLITICIANS AROUND THE WORLD,

04:53.593 --> 04:54.727
BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO

04:54.794 --> 04:56.295
WILDLY SPECULATE ABOUT IT.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.965
THAT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE."

04:59.032 --> 05:00.266
[LAUGHTER]

05:00.333 --> 05:01.401
BUT CRUCIALLY, MARCHANT ISN'T

05:01.467 --> 05:02.568
ALONE, HE'S ACTUALLY LEADING A

05:02.635 --> 05:03.903
GROUP OF CANDIDATES CALLED

05:03.970 --> 05:05.438
THE AMERICA FIRST SECRETARY OF

05:05.505 --> 05:06.806
STATE COALITION, WHICH ALSO

05:06.873 --> 05:08.508
INCLUDES NEW MEXICO'S

05:08.574 --> 05:09.776
AUDREY TRUJILLO, WHO'S REFERRED

05:09.842 --> 05:12.378
TO THE 2020 ELECTION AS

05:12.445 --> 05:13.613
"A COUP," MAKING HER EXPLANATION

05:13.680 --> 05:14.914
OF WHY SHE DECIDED TO RUN FOR

05:14.981 --> 05:17.116
OFFICE A BIT WORRISOME.

05:17.183 --> 05:19.952
>> I DECIDED TO RUN FOR

05:20.019 --> 05:22.221
SECRETARY OF STATE WHEN I SAW

05:22.288 --> 05:23.556
THE VERY INCONSISTENCIES IN THIS

05:23.623 --> 05:25.992
LAST ELECTION, YOU KNOW.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.193
I FEEL THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE,

05:27.260 --> 05:29.062
WHETHER WE CAN PROVE IT OR NOT,

05:29.128 --> 05:30.029
FEEL THAT THIS ELECTION WAS

05:30.096 --> 05:32.065
STOLEN.

05:32.131 --> 05:32.999
>> John: WAIT, WAIT, "WHETHER WE

05:33.066 --> 05:34.834
CAN PROVE IT OR NOT?"

05:34.901 --> 05:36.469
BUT THAT'S A PRETTY BIG

05:36.536 --> 05:38.604
LOOPHOLE, ISN'T IT, AUDREY?

05:38.671 --> 05:40.239
WE ALL BELIEVE PLENTY OF THINGS

05:40.306 --> 05:41.874
THAT WE CAN'T PROVE, BUT WE

05:41.941 --> 05:42.508
SHOULDN'T BASE MAJOR LIFE

05:42.575 --> 05:44.077
DECISIONS ON THEM.

05:44.143 --> 05:45.478
FOR INSTANCE, I CAN'T PROVE

05:45.545 --> 05:49.782
THAT, IN HIS DAY, BELOVED

05:49.849 --> 05:51.751
CHILDREN'S AUTHOR OF "THE GIVING

05:51.818 --> 05:52.652
TREE" SHEL SILVERSTEIN WAS

05:52.719 --> 05:54.053
FUCKING NONSTOP.

05:54.120 --> 05:54.954
I BELIEVE IT, THOUGH!

05:55.021 --> 05:57.123
LOOK AT HIM.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.591
NOW YOU BELIEVE IT, TOO!

05:58.658 --> 05:59.592
LOOK AT AMERICA'S FIRST FUCK

05:59.659 --> 06:00.226
BOY, HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE THE

06:00.293 --> 06:01.527
SIDEWALK ENDS.

06:01.594 --> 06:02.929
[LAUGHTER]

06:02.995 --> 06:03.796
BUT AGAIN, WE CAN'T PROVE IT,

06:03.863 --> 06:04.597
CAN WE?

06:04.664 --> 06:06.766
SO WE JUST KEEP THAT BELIEF IN

06:06.833 --> 06:08.968
OUR HEARTS, AND TRY NOT TO USE

06:09.035 --> 06:09.936
IT AS MOTIVATION TO COMPLETELY

06:10.002 --> 06:11.270
DISMANTLE DEMOCRACY.

06:11.337 --> 06:12.872
IT'S THE LEAST THAT WE CAN DO!

06:12.939 --> 06:13.773
AND THEN THERE IS KRISTINA

06:13.840 --> 06:14.607
KARAMO, WHO'S RUNNING FOR

06:14.674 --> 06:16.175
SECRETARY OF STATE IN MICHIGAN,

06:16.242 --> 06:18.678
AND WHO IS REALLY SOMETHING.

06:18.745 --> 06:19.946
>> KRISTINA KARAMO HAS NOT BEEN

06:20.012 --> 06:21.147
SHY IN INSISTING THERE WAS

06:21.214 --> 06:22.582
WIDESPREAD CHEATING IN THE 2020

06:22.648 --> 06:24.784
VOTE, TOUTING DEBUNKED CLAIMS

06:24.851 --> 06:25.818
AND SAYING DONALD TRUMP WAS THE

06:25.885 --> 06:27.487
TRUE WINNER IN MICHIGAN.

06:27.553 --> 06:28.654
HER MOST INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE

06:28.721 --> 06:30.389
IS AIMED AT DEMOCRATS.

06:30.456 --> 06:31.524
>> THEIR PARTY HAS TOTALLY BEEN

06:31.591 --> 06:33.459
TAKEN OVER BY A SATANIC AGENDA.

06:33.526 --> 06:34.227
>> INCLUDING MICHIGAN'S CURRENT

06:34.293 --> 06:35.695
SECRETARY OF STATE.

06:35.762 --> 06:37.964
>> SHE'S AN EVIL WOMAN.

06:38.030 --> 06:38.564
SHE'S A VERY, EVIL, EVIL, EVIL

06:38.631 --> 06:39.599
WOMAN.

06:39.665 --> 06:42.235
>> John: OKAY, OBVIOUSLY,

06:42.301 --> 06:43.436
DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE A SATANIC

06:43.503 --> 06:44.804
AGENDA, MAINLY BECAUSE THAT

06:44.871 --> 06:45.671
WOULD REQUIRE HAVING AN AGENDA

06:45.738 --> 06:48.241
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

06:48.307 --> 06:49.675
[LAUGHTER]

06:49.742 --> 06:50.543
ALSO, FOR THE RECORD, MICHIGAN'S

06:50.610 --> 06:53.646
CURRENT SECRETARY OF STATE,

06:53.713 --> 06:57.049
JOCELYN BENSON, IS NOT EVIL,

06:57.116 --> 06:58.551
EVIL, EVIL.

06:58.618 --> 06:59.485
IN FACT, JUST GO TO HER

06:59.552 --> 07:00.553
WIKIPEDIA PAGE, AND LOOK FOR THE

07:00.620 --> 07:01.354
SECTION ENTITLED "HORRIBLE ACTS

07:01.420 --> 07:02.421
OF EVIL."

07:02.488 --> 07:03.756
IT IS JUST NOT THERE.

07:03.823 --> 07:04.757
ALTHOUGH YOU WILL FIND THAT "SHE

07:04.824 --> 07:05.558
HAS COMPLETED 23 FULL MARATHONS

07:05.625 --> 07:06.626
SINCE 2005."

07:06.692 --> 07:07.660
BUT THAT'S NOT EVIL, IS IT?

07:07.727 --> 07:08.895
IT'S JUST ANNOYING.

07:08.961 --> 07:10.096
[LAUGHTER]

07:10.163 --> 07:11.130
NO JUDGMENT, BUT THE ONLY REASON

07:11.197 --> 07:12.098
TO RUN THAT MANY MARATHONS IS

07:12.165 --> 07:13.032
BECAUSE YOU LIKE BRAGGING TO

07:13.099 --> 07:14.167
YOUR FRIENDS, OR YOU'RE HORNY

07:14.233 --> 07:15.601
FOR STOPPING TRAFFIC.

07:15.668 --> 07:18.271
THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO OPTIONS.

07:18.337 --> 07:19.539
[LAUGHTER]

07:19.605 --> 07:20.840
BUT LOOK, EXTREME VIEWS ON

07:20.907 --> 07:22.208
ELECTION FRAUD ARE PAR FOR THE

07:22.275 --> 07:23.242
COURSE FOR THIS COALITION.

07:23.309 --> 07:24.510
THE THING WITH KARAMO IS THAT

07:24.577 --> 07:25.645
SHE HAS A LOT OF OTHER VIEWS,

07:25.711 --> 07:26.679
TOO.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.114
>> SHE SUGGESTED IN A PODCAST

07:28.181 --> 07:29.182
THAT PREMARITAL SEX PAVES THE

07:29.248 --> 07:30.516
WAY FOR SOCIETY CONDONING

07:30.583 --> 07:31.784
PEDOPHILIA.

07:31.851 --> 07:35.555
>> WHEN WE NORMALIZE PEOPLE

07:35.621 --> 07:36.856
FORNICATING, AND WE NORMALIZE

07:36.923 --> 07:38.424
PEOPLE LIVING TOGETHER WITH

07:38.491 --> 07:39.292
THEIR BOYFRIENDS AND

07:39.358 --> 07:41.594
GIRLFRIENDS, ALL THIS STUFF, WE

07:41.661 --> 07:42.995
OPEN A DOOR TO US TO GET TO THE

07:43.062 --> 07:43.696
POINT WHERE WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO

07:43.763 --> 07:45.965
WANT TO NORMALIZE PEDOPHILIA.

07:46.032 --> 07:46.933
>> SHE ALSO REFERRED TO

07:46.999 --> 07:48.000
HERSELF AS AN ANTI-VAXXER BEFORE

07:48.067 --> 07:48.534
THE COVID-19 VACCINES WERE

07:48.601 --> 07:49.836
AUTHORIZED.

07:49.902 --> 07:51.337
>> [WHISPERING]

07:51.404 --> 07:52.939
GUESS WHAT, I'M CRAZY.

07:53.005 --> 07:54.540
I'M AN ANTI-VAXXER.

07:54.607 --> 07:55.608
>> John: OH, COME ON, YOU DON'T

07:55.675 --> 07:57.076
SOUND CRAZY, WHISPERED VOICE ON

07:57.143 --> 07:59.178
THE PHONE.

07:59.245 --> 08:00.112
[LAUGHTER]

08:00.179 --> 08:01.681
AND WHILE THERE'S A LOT TO

08:01.747 --> 08:02.615
OBJECT TO THERE, "WE NORMALIZE

08:02.682 --> 08:03.216
PEOPLE FORNICATING AND LIVING

08:03.282 --> 08:05.284
TOGETHER AS BOYFRIEND AND

08:05.351 --> 08:06.519
GIRLFRIEND" IS LIKE, TEN FAKE

08:06.586 --> 08:07.987
MORAL PANICS AGO.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.856
I'M NOT SAYING SHE'S NOT WRONG,

08:09.922 --> 08:12.658
IT'S JUST SHE'S WRONG IN SUCH AN

08:12.725 --> 08:14.060
OUTDATED WAY, IT'S LIKE FINDING

08:14.126 --> 08:15.027
OUT SOMEONE'S MAD AT

08:15.094 --> 08:15.761
BILL CLINTON FOR TRYING WEED.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.530
YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT THAT?

08:17.597 --> 08:19.198
TODAY?

08:19.265 --> 08:19.999
I MEAN, YOU'RE WRONG FOR BEING

08:20.066 --> 08:21.167
MAD ABOUT THAT BUT EVEN WORSE,

08:21.234 --> 08:24.570
YOU'RE LATE.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.706
LOOK, THESE ARE JUST THREE OF

08:26.772 --> 08:27.273
THE WORRYING CANDIDATES FOR

08:27.340 --> 08:31.577
SECRETARY OF STATE AROUND THE

08:31.644 --> 08:36.148
COUNTRY.

08:36.215 --> 08:37.283
THERE ARE MANY, MANY OTHERS.

08:37.350 --> 08:37.817
WHICH SHOULD FRANKLY GIVE

08:37.884 --> 08:38.584
EVERYONE PAUSE.

08:38.651 --> 08:39.318
BECAUSE THE JANUARY 6TH

08:39.385 --> 08:40.152
COMMITTEE IS REMINDING EVERYONE

08:40.219 --> 08:41.153
JUST HOW CLOSE WE CAME TO

08:41.220 --> 08:42.021
DEMOCRACY BASICALLY COLLAPSING.

08:42.088 --> 08:43.055
IT WAS A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE IN

08:43.122 --> 08:43.956
THE RIGHT POSITION CHOOSING TO

08:44.023 --> 08:45.258
DO THE RIGHT THING THAT SAVED US

08:45.324 --> 08:45.925
FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS.

08:45.992 --> 08:46.959
BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE

08:47.026 --> 08:48.027
CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR

08:48.094 --> 08:49.061
CONSEQUENTIAL POSITIONS RIGHT

08:49.128 --> 08:50.363
NOW ON THE PLATFORM OF

08:50.429 --> 08:51.931
BASICALLY, "LET'S DO THE COUP

08:51.998 --> 08:54.400
AGAIN, BUT BETTER NEXT TIME."

08:54.467 --> 08:55.701
AND IF YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT

08:55.768 --> 08:57.203
THAT, IF I MAY QUOTE A MAN WITH

08:57.270 --> 08:59.205
THE WORLD'S MOST CHAOTIC ZOOM

08:59.272 --> 09:00.306
BACKDROP, YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR

09:00.373 --> 09:01.474
FUCKING MIND.

09:01.540 --> 09:06.312
AND NOW, THIS.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.513
>> Announcer: AND NOW, IN

09:07.580 --> 09:10.116
HONOR OF FATHER'S DAY, ZADDIES.

09:10.182 --> 09:10.917
>> I HEARD YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A

09:10.983 --> 09:15.454
ZADDY IS!

09:15.521 --> 09:16.355
>> I DON'T.

09:16.422 --> 09:17.089
>> WHAT IS A ZADDY?

09:17.156 --> 09:18.124
>> A ZADDY IS A VERY HOT,

09:18.190 --> 09:18.891
SEXY OLDER MAN OLDER MAN.

09:18.958 --> 09:23.062
>> WHAT DOES THE "Z" STAND FOR?

09:23.129 --> 09:25.932
>> IT'S LIKE DADDY BUT WITH THE

09:25.998 --> 09:26.165
Z.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.034
DEFINED AS AN ATTRACTIVE MAN WHO

09:28.100 --> 09:31.771
IS ALSO CHARMING AND CONFIDENT.

09:31.837 --> 09:33.005
>> ARE YOU A ZADDY?

09:33.072 --> 09:36.409
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

09:36.475 --> 09:37.610
>> ZADDIES STAY OVER THERE.

09:37.677 --> 09:41.047
>> DO WE QUALIFY AS ZADDIES?

09:41.113 --> 09:47.086
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT JEFF BEZOS,

09:47.153 --> 09:49.322
HE HAS ACHIEVED A LOT BUT NOW HE

09:49.388 --> 09:50.222
IS ADDING ZADDY.

09:50.289 --> 09:54.894
>> IS HE A ZADDY?

09:54.961 --> 09:55.861
>> 100% NOT.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.397
>> WHO IS MORE ZADDY?

09:58.464 --> 10:01.934
>> YOU ARE BOTH ZADDY.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.303
>> I WOULD SAY MY HUSBAND IS

10:04.370 --> 10:06.806
ZADDY.

10:06.872 --> 10:07.340
[LAUGHTER]

10:07.406 --> 10:09.342
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT

10:09.408 --> 10:11.043
GARY DOWN THE HALLWAY TOO, BUT

10:11.110 --> 10:12.378
WHATEVER.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.879
[LAUGHTER]

10:13.946 --> 10:14.747
>> John: MOVING ON.

10:14.814 --> 10:15.748
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:15.815 --> 10:22.088
HOUSING.

10:22.154 --> 10:23.089
THE THING THAT 16-YEAR-OLD

10:23.155 --> 10:24.623
TIKTOK MILLIONAIRES CAN AFFORD,

10:24.690 --> 10:25.758
AND YOU CAN'T.

10:25.825 --> 10:26.659
HOUSING IS SOMETHING TV

10:26.726 --> 10:27.793
AUDIENCES CAN'T SEEM TO GET

10:27.860 --> 10:28.527
ENOUGH OF, WHETHER IT'S WATCHING

10:28.594 --> 10:29.528
ANGRY COUPLES HUNT FOR THE

10:29.595 --> 10:30.196
PERFECT PLACE TO GET DIVORCED

10:30.262 --> 10:31.230
IN, OR WATCHING CELEBRITIES

10:31.297 --> 10:32.198
GIVING ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST

10:32.264 --> 10:33.199
TOURS OF THEIR HOMES, AS THEY

10:33.265 --> 10:34.166
DISCOVER THINGS THAT WERE

10:34.233 --> 10:35.067
CLEARLY PUT THERE BY STYLISTS,

10:35.134 --> 10:36.102
AND OCCASIONALLY CALL IT OUT IN

10:36.168 --> 10:36.969
A GLORIOUSLY PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE

10:37.036 --> 10:38.404
WAY.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.605
>> I LOVE COOKING.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.741
I COOK A LOT AND I BAKE A LOT.

10:41.807 --> 10:42.942
>> I LOVE LIMES, I LOVE THEM,

10:43.009 --> 10:43.809
THEY'RE GREAT, I LOVE THEM SO

10:43.876 --> 10:44.910
MUCH AND I LIKE TO PRESENT THEM

10:44.977 --> 10:47.780
LIKE THIS IN MY HOUSE.

10:47.847 --> 10:50.583
[LAUGHTER]

10:50.649 --> 10:51.317
>> John: SHE'S SO MAGNIFICENTLY

10:51.384 --> 10:52.718
WEIRD.

10:52.785 --> 10:54.086
REAL DAKOTA-HEADS WILL KNOW THAT

10:54.153 --> 10:54.920
SHE LATER CLAIMED SHE IS, IN

10:54.987 --> 10:56.122
FACT, ACTUALLY ALLERGIC TO

10:56.188 --> 10:57.189
LIMES, SAYING "IT WAS HARD TO

10:57.256 --> 10:58.424
IGNORE THEM, SO I JUST LIED."

10:58.491 --> 10:59.792
BUT SHE MAY WELL HAVE JUST BEEN

10:59.859 --> 11:00.826
LYING ABOUT THAT AS WELL.

11:00.893 --> 11:01.560
SHE'S PURE CHAOS, I LOVE HER,

11:01.627 --> 11:03.963
SHE SHOULD BE THE PRESIDENT.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.231
[LAUGHTER]

11:05.297 --> 11:05.998
BUT THIS STORY ISN'T GOING TO BE

11:06.065 --> 11:06.932
ABOUT PEOPLE WHO OWN THEIR OWN,

11:06.999 --> 11:08.200
LIME-INFESTED HOMES.

11:08.267 --> 11:13.973
IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT THE MORE

11:14.040 --> 11:14.440
THAN 1/3 OF AMERICAN

11:14.507 --> 11:15.641
HOUSEHOLDS WHO RENT.

11:15.708 --> 11:16.776
AND IF YOU DO RENT, YOU'LL

11:16.842 --> 11:17.376
UNDOUBTEDLY BE AWARE OF WHAT'S

11:17.443 --> 11:18.611
BEEN HAPPENING RECENTLY.

11:18.677 --> 11:19.211
>> TONIGHT, SKYROCKETING RENTS

11:19.278 --> 11:19.979
FORCING A GROWING NUMBER OF

11:20.046 --> 11:20.780
AMERICANS TO THINK TWICE ABOUT

11:20.846 --> 11:21.981
WHERE HOME IS.

11:22.048 --> 11:22.948
>> RENT PRICES ACROSS THE

11:23.015 --> 11:24.350
COUNTRY SKYROCKETING.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.685
>> RENTS ARE RISING NATIONWIDE.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.821
>> RENTS ARE GOING WAY, WAY UP.

11:28.888 --> 11:29.588
>> John: YEAH, RENT IS

11:29.655 --> 11:31.323
SKYROCKETING.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.059
AND THAT IS THE LAST THING YOU

11:33.125 --> 11:34.693
WANT TO HEAR IS ON THE RISE,

11:34.760 --> 11:36.028
ALONG WITH COVID CASES, MURDER

11:36.095 --> 11:36.796
RATES, AND HENRY KISSINGER'S

11:36.862 --> 11:39.598
LIFE EXPECTANCY.

11:39.665 --> 11:40.733
[LAUGHTER]

11:40.800 --> 11:41.567
THE BITCH JUST WON'T QUIT, WILL

11:41.634 --> 11:43.736
HE?

11:43.803 --> 11:45.204
THE MEDIAN MONTHLY ASKING RENT

11:45.271 --> 11:46.672
IN THE U.S. SURPASSED $2,000

11:46.739 --> 11:49.475
FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST MONTH.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.810
THAT'S UP 15% SINCE THE SAME

11:50.876 --> 11:51.710
TIME LAST YEAR, WELL ABOVE THE

11:51.777 --> 11:53.579
RATE OF INFLATION.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.714
AND IT'S UP OVER 30% IN CITIES

11:55.781 --> 11:57.683
LIKE CINCINNATI, SEATTLE, AND

11:57.750 --> 11:59.118
NASHVILLE, AND NEARLY 50% IN

11:59.185 --> 12:00.853
AUSTIN.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.221
YOU, OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW, MIGHT

12:02.288 --> 12:04.090
WELL BE STRUGGLING TO FIND A

12:04.156 --> 12:05.024
PLACE RIGHT NOW, OR ARE BEING

12:05.091 --> 12:06.192
PRICED OUT OF WHERE YOU

12:06.258 --> 12:08.194
CURRENTLY LIVE BY YOUR LANDLORD.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.429
BUT THE FACT IS, RENT

12:10.496 --> 12:11.130
AFFORDABILITY ISN'T A REMOTELY

12:11.197 --> 12:13.732
NEW PROBLEM.

12:13.799 --> 12:14.967
>> IF YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK, YOUR

12:15.034 --> 12:16.402
CITY BECAME UNAFFORDABLE TO RENT

12:16.469 --> 12:17.937
IN IN 2004.

12:18.003 --> 12:19.672
SEE THIS LINE?

12:19.738 --> 12:20.506
THAT LINE IS 30% OF WHAT YOU

12:20.573 --> 12:21.540
MAKE.

12:21.607 --> 12:22.708
GENERALLY, FOR RENT, IT'S

12:22.775 --> 12:23.609
ADVISED YOU DON'T SPEND PAST

12:23.676 --> 12:25.277
THAT LINE.

12:25.344 --> 12:26.679
BUT IF YOU LIVE IN MIAMI, YOU

12:26.745 --> 12:27.313
PROBABLY PASSED THAT LINE IN

12:27.379 --> 12:30.216
2001.

12:30.282 --> 12:32.118
AND IN CHICAGO IN 2012.

12:32.184 --> 12:33.486
LOS ANGELES HAS BEEN PLAIN

12:33.552 --> 12:35.721
UNAFFORDABLE SINCE BEFORE 1979.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.323
RENT IS GROWING FASTER THAN THE

12:37.389 --> 12:38.257
MONEY MOST PEOPLE MAKE TO PAY

12:38.324 --> 12:45.564
IT.

12:45.631 --> 12:47.566
>> John: IT'S TRUE, RENT IS

12:47.633 --> 12:49.068
GROWING FASTER THAN WAGES.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.002
IT'S A PROBLEM WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT

12:50.069 --> 12:50.769
FOR DECADES AND IS ONLY GETTING

12:50.836 --> 12:51.437
WORSE.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.404
WHICH WAS, I BELIEVE, A WORKING

12:52.471 --> 12:56.242
TITLE FOR THIS SHOW.

12:56.308 --> 13:00.813
IT WAS EITHER THAT, OR

13:00.880 --> 13:01.714
"AMERICA'S SADDEST HOME VIDEOS

13:01.780 --> 13:03.649
WITH ADULT McLOVIN."

13:03.716 --> 13:04.483
[LAUGHTER]

13:04.550 --> 13:05.551
YOU'RE LAUGHING TOO HARD AT

13:05.618 --> 13:06.719
THAT.

13:06.785 --> 13:07.820
IN FACT, RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT A

13:07.887 --> 13:08.554
SINGLE COUNTY IN THE U.S. WHERE

13:08.621 --> 13:09.321
A WORKER EARNING MINIMUM WAGE

13:09.388 --> 13:10.222
CAN AFFORD A MODEST TWO-BEDROOM

13:10.289 --> 13:15.227
RENTAL HOME.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.262
AND LOOK, THERE ARE UNDOUBTEDLY

13:16.328 --> 13:16.896
INDIVIDUAL LANDLORDS OUT THERE

13:16.962 --> 13:17.763
WHO BEHAVE DECENTLY TO THEIR

13:17.830 --> 13:18.664
TENANTS.

13:18.731 --> 13:19.598
BUT OTHERS WILL CONVENIENTLY

13:19.665 --> 13:20.499
BLAME "THE MARKET RATE" FOR

13:20.566 --> 13:23.636
EXTORTIONATE RENT HIKES, AND

13:23.702 --> 13:26.539
IMPLY THAT THE DECISION SIMPLY

13:26.605 --> 13:27.940
ISN'T THEIRS TO MAKE.

13:28.007 --> 13:28.841
JUST WATCH FINANCIAL GURU

13:28.908 --> 13:29.775
DAVE RAMSEY TRY AND REASSURE ONE

13:29.842 --> 13:30.643
LANDLORD WHO SAID HE FELT GUILTY

13:30.709 --> 13:31.911
ABOUT RAISING HIS RENTS ABOVE

13:31.977 --> 13:32.945
WHAT HIS TENANTS COULD AFFORD.

13:33.012 --> 13:35.047
>> IF I RAISE MY RENT TO BE

13:35.114 --> 13:36.048
MARKET RATE, THAT DOES NOT MAKE

13:36.115 --> 13:38.751
ME A BAD CHRISTIAN.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.320
I DID NOT DISPLACE THE PERSON

13:41.387 --> 13:42.321
OUT OF THAT HOUSE IF THEY CAN NO

13:42.388 --> 13:43.189
LONGER AFFORD IT, THE

13:43.255 --> 13:44.790
MARKETPLACE DID.

13:44.857 --> 13:48.027
THE ECONOMY DID.

13:48.093 --> 13:51.530
THE RATIO OF THE INCOME THAT

13:51.597 --> 13:52.431
THEY EARN TO THEIR HOUSING

13:52.498 --> 13:53.732
EXPENSE DISPLACED THEM.

13:53.799 --> 13:55.401
I DIDN'T CAUSE ANY OF THAT.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.402
>> John: OF COURSE, KICKING

13:56.468 --> 13:58.204
SOMEONE OUT OF YOUR HOUSE

13:58.270 --> 13:58.771
DOESN'T MAKE YOU A BAD

13:58.837 --> 13:59.705
CHRISTIAN.

13:59.772 --> 14:00.839
IT'S IN THE BEATITUDES:

14:00.906 --> 14:01.974
"BLESSED ARE THE POOR IN SPIRIT,

14:02.041 --> 14:02.541
FOR THEIRS IS THE KINGDOM OF

14:02.608 --> 14:03.842
HEAVEN.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.144
FUCKED ARE THE POOR IN MONEY,

14:05.211 --> 14:05.744
FOR THEIRS IS THE KINGDOM OF

14:05.811 --> 14:07.313
LANDLORDS.

14:07.379 --> 14:09.048
WAZZAAAAAAAAAAAA!"

14:09.114 --> 14:11.016
[LAUGHTER]

14:11.083 --> 14:12.451
SO GIVEN THAT RENTS ARE GOING UP

14:12.518 --> 14:14.053
AND SOME LANDLORDS SEEM TO THINK

14:14.119 --> 14:15.588
THAT'S COMPLETELY UNAVOIDABLE,

14:15.654 --> 14:16.889
WE THOUGHT, TONIGHT, WE'D LOOK

14:16.956 --> 14:18.624
AT RENTAL HOUSING: WHY IT'S

14:18.691 --> 14:19.792
INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE, HOW

14:19.858 --> 14:21.227
STEEPLY THE SYSTEM IS STACKED

14:21.293 --> 14:22.328
AGAINST RENTERS, AND WHAT WE CAN

14:22.394 --> 14:23.662
DO TO COMBAT THAT.

14:23.729 --> 14:24.763
AND LET'S START WITH

14:24.830 --> 14:25.664
UNDERSTANDING OUR CURRENT

14:25.731 --> 14:26.932
HOUSING SUPPLY.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.801
YOU'LL OFTEN HEAR THAT HIGH

14:28.867 --> 14:30.069
RENTS ARE A SUPPLY AND DEMAND

14:30.135 --> 14:31.270
ISSUE: BASICALLY, TOO MANY

14:31.337 --> 14:34.673
RENTERS, NOT ENOUGH UNITS.

14:34.740 --> 14:35.774
AND THAT IS PARTIALLY TRUE.

14:35.841 --> 14:36.875
BECAUSE THERE CURRENTLY AREN'T

14:36.942 --> 14:37.843
NEARLY ENOUGH AFFORDABLE UNITS

14:37.910 --> 14:39.712
IN THE U.S.

14:39.778 --> 14:40.846
WHICH IS A LITTLE WEIRD TO THINK

14:40.913 --> 14:42.281
ABOUT, BECAUSE IF YOU LIVE IN

14:42.348 --> 14:43.549
ANY CITY, YOU PROBABLY SEE NEW

14:43.616 --> 14:45.017
BUILDINGS CROPPING UP ALL THE

14:45.084 --> 14:47.186
TIME, CALLED THINGS LIKE

14:47.253 --> 14:49.755
"4 EAST" OR "SUMMIT 3ELEVEN,"

14:49.822 --> 14:51.190
WITH TAGLINES LIKE "LUXURY URBAN

14:51.257 --> 14:53.158
DWELLINGS DRIVEN BY DESIGN."

14:53.225 --> 14:54.126
THERE'S ALMOST CERTAINLY A

14:54.193 --> 14:54.994
COFFEE SHOP WITHOUT A BATHROOM

14:55.060 --> 14:57.363
ON THE GROUND FLOOR.

14:57.429 --> 14:58.497
[LAUGHTER]

14:58.564 --> 14:59.865
SO APARTMENTS ARE BEING BUILT.

14:59.932 --> 15:01.433
BUT THE PROBLEM IS, THANKS IN

15:01.500 --> 15:02.801
PART TO LOCAL, NIMBY OPPOSITION

15:02.868 --> 15:04.303
TO MORE AFFORDABLE, MULTI-FAMILY

15:04.370 --> 15:05.104
HOUSING, IT'S MAINLY BEEN AT THE

15:05.170 --> 15:06.872
HIGH END.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.440
IN FACT, IN THE LAST THREE

15:08.507 --> 15:10.042
DECADES, THE NATIONAL STOCK OF

15:10.109 --> 15:11.944
RENTAL UNITS AVAILABLE ACTUALLY

15:12.011 --> 15:14.313
GREW BY MORE THAN 13 MILLION.

15:14.380 --> 15:15.581
BUT, CRUCIALLY, THE NUMBER OF

15:15.648 --> 15:17.283
UNITS AT THE LOWEST END OF THE

15:17.349 --> 15:18.117
MARKET FELL BY NEARLY FOUR

15:18.183 --> 15:19.918
MILLION.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.520
THAT MIGHT BE WHY IF YOU'VE EVER

15:21.587 --> 15:22.721
TRIED TO SEARCH FOR AFFORDABLE

15:22.788 --> 15:23.656
APARTMENTS IN YOUR AREA, GOOGLE

15:23.722 --> 15:25.291
JUST SAYS "NOPE."

15:25.357 --> 15:27.026
[LAUGHTER]

15:27.092 --> 15:28.594
AND THIS SERIOUS LACK OF NEW

15:28.661 --> 15:29.662
AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS ENABLED

15:29.728 --> 15:31.063
LANDLORDS TO CHARGE HIGHER RENTS

15:31.130 --> 15:33.198
FOR THE UNITS THAT EXIST,

15:33.265 --> 15:35.100
SOMETHING THAT'S INCREASINGLY

15:35.167 --> 15:41.740
ATTRACTED INSTITUTIONAL

15:41.807 --> 15:42.841
INVESTORS: THESE ARE CORPORATE

15:42.908 --> 15:44.109
LANDLORDS, LIKE PRIVATE EQUITY

15:44.176 --> 15:45.377
FIRMS, OR EVEN PUBLICLY TRADED

15:45.444 --> 15:46.545
COMPANIES, THAT POOL THE RENTS

15:46.612 --> 15:47.913
OF THEIR TENANTS AND SELL THEM

15:47.980 --> 15:49.281
AS INVESTMENTS.

15:49.348 --> 15:50.482
THEY'VE LONG BEEN PLAYERS IN

15:50.549 --> 15:51.550
APARTMENT RENTALS, BUT MORE

15:51.617 --> 15:52.685
RECENTLY, AFTER THE 2008 HOUSING

15:52.751 --> 15:54.153
CRASH, COMPANIES LIKE THESE

15:54.219 --> 15:55.754
POPPED UP TO SNAP UP

15:55.821 --> 15:57.189
SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES AND RENT

15:57.256 --> 15:58.557
THEM OUT.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.892
AND BECAUSE INSTITUTIONAL

15:59.958 --> 16:00.959
INVESTORS ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO

16:01.026 --> 16:01.927
MAXIMIZE RETURNS, THEY'LL TAKE

16:01.994 --> 16:03.195
ANY OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH RENTS

16:03.262 --> 16:04.363
HIGHER.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.597
TAKE MONARCH, WHICH HAS BEEN

16:05.664 --> 16:06.432
CALLED MIDDLE AMERICA'S

16:06.498 --> 16:07.566
FASTEST-GROWING LANDLORD.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.335
HERE IS THEIR OWNER LAST YEAR

16:09.401 --> 16:10.502
SALIVATING AT THE PROSPECT OF

16:10.569 --> 16:12.171
RENT HIKES.

16:12.237 --> 16:13.839
>> WE HAVE AN UNPRECEDENTED

16:13.906 --> 16:15.741
OPPORTUNITY, AT LEAST IN MY

16:15.808 --> 16:18.043
WORKING LIFETIME, TO REALLY

16:18.110 --> 16:19.878
PRESS RENTS, PRESS RENTS ON

16:19.945 --> 16:20.979
RENEWALS BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS

16:21.046 --> 16:22.314
HIGHLY OCCUPIED.

16:22.381 --> 16:24.516
WE'RE 97.5%.

16:24.583 --> 16:25.284
AND SO, WHERE ARE PEOPLE GOING

16:25.351 --> 16:26.218
TO GO?

16:26.285 --> 16:27.820
THEY CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.

16:27.886 --> 16:29.254
THEY WANT TO BE IN APARTMENTS,

16:29.321 --> 16:30.155
OR THEY HAVE TO BE IN

16:30.222 --> 16:31.457
APARTMENTS, AND WE HAVE A

16:31.523 --> 16:34.226
TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESS

16:34.293 --> 16:36.962
BOTH ON RENEWING LEASES FOR

16:37.029 --> 16:39.231
EXISTING RESIDENTS, AND TO RESET

16:39.298 --> 16:41.533
MARKET RATES, WHICH WE'VE RESET

16:41.600 --> 16:42.868
NUMEROUS TIMES EVEN THIS YEAR.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.570
>> John: WOW.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.138
"THEY CAN'T GO ANYWHERE, AND FOR

16:46.205 --> 16:47.840
US, THAT'S AN UNPRECEDENTED

16:47.906 --> 16:50.042
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESS THEM."

16:50.109 --> 16:50.743
THAT IS A TERRIBLE WAY TO TALK

16:50.809 --> 16:53.112
ABOUT PEOPLE.

16:53.178 --> 16:53.946
HONESTLY, IT'S BARELY AN

16:54.012 --> 16:54.813
ACCEPTABLE WAY TO TALK ABOUT

16:54.880 --> 16:56.382
PANINIS.

16:56.448 --> 16:57.549
"THOSE SANDWICHES CAN'T GO

16:57.616 --> 17:00.386
ANYWHERE, FUCK IT, PRESS 'EM.

17:00.452 --> 17:01.653
SQUEEZE THOSE FUCKERS!

17:01.720 --> 17:05.224
I WANNA SEE LINES!"

17:05.290 --> 17:05.491
[LAUGHTER]

17:05.557 --> 17:10.362
SO IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHY YOUR

17:10.429 --> 17:11.397
RENT IS GOING UP, IT MAY WELL

17:11.463 --> 17:12.664
BE BECAUSE YOUR LANDLORD SEES

17:12.731 --> 17:14.099
THE CURRENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING

17:14.166 --> 17:15.300
CRISIS AS A CHANCE TO "RESET

17:15.367 --> 17:16.535
MARKET RATES."

17:16.602 --> 17:17.803
AND IN A LOT OF THE COUNTRY,

17:17.870 --> 17:18.670
THERE ARE VERY FEW LEGAL

17:18.737 --> 17:19.738
CONSTRAINTS TO STOP THEM DOING

17:19.805 --> 17:21.206
THAT.

17:21.273 --> 17:22.174
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF "RENT

17:22.241 --> 17:23.242
CONTROL," WHICH STRICTLY LIMITS

17:23.308 --> 17:24.610
HOW MUCH A LANDLORD CAN CHARGE

17:24.676 --> 17:25.978
YOU, BUT VANISHINGLY FEW PEOPLE

17:26.044 --> 17:27.246
HAVE ACCESS TO THAT ANYMORE.

17:27.312 --> 17:28.380
MORE COMMONLY, THERE'S RENT

17:28.447 --> 17:29.448
STABILIZATION.

17:29.515 --> 17:30.849
WHICH, IN THEORY, MEANS THAT ON

17:30.916 --> 17:32.151
CERTAIN OLDER PROPERTIES,

17:32.217 --> 17:33.385
LANDLORDS CAN ONLY RAISE THE

17:33.452 --> 17:34.319
RENT BY A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE PER

17:34.386 --> 17:35.387
YEAR.

17:35.454 --> 17:36.822
BUT ONLY TWO STATES AND DC

17:36.889 --> 17:38.290
REQUIRE IT, AND MORE THAN 30

17:38.357 --> 17:39.324
STATES HAVE ACTUALLY PASSED LAWS

17:39.391 --> 17:41.160
BANNING IT.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.594
AND EVEN WHEN PROTECTIONS EXIST,

17:42.661 --> 17:43.395
LANDLORDS CAN FIND WAYS AROUND

17:43.462 --> 17:45.030
THEM.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.298
FOR INSTANCE, THEY MIGHT TRY AND

17:46.365 --> 17:47.633
FORCE RENT-STABILIZED TENANTS

17:47.699 --> 17:49.067
OUT BY ALLOWING A PROPERTY TO

17:49.134 --> 17:50.769
FALL INTO DISREPAIR.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.271
OR BY HARASSING THEM WITH

17:52.337 --> 17:53.672
INCESSANT CONSTRUCTION UNTIL

17:53.739 --> 17:55.641
THEY VOLUNTARILY LEAVE.

17:55.707 --> 17:56.875
TAKE THE RENT-STABILIZED TENANTS

17:56.942 --> 17:57.810
WHO LIVED IN THIS BUILDING IN

17:57.876 --> 17:59.445
NEW YORK.

17:59.511 --> 18:00.913
THEIR LANDLORD CLAIMED HE WAS

18:00.979 --> 18:02.014
SIMPLY UPGRADING IT TO IMPROVE

18:02.080 --> 18:04.183
TENANTS' QUALITY OF LIFE.

18:04.249 --> 18:04.883
BUT THAT IS NOT HOW IT FELT TO

18:04.950 --> 18:06.485
THEM.

18:06.552 --> 18:08.420
>> TENANTS SAY THEY WERE OFFERED

18:08.487 --> 18:09.822
BUYOUTS TO LEAVE, BUT SOME, LIKE

18:09.888 --> 18:11.089
GEORGE MANATOS AND GRETCHEN

18:11.156 --> 18:12.658
MONGRAIN, WHO'VE LIVED HERE FOR

18:12.724 --> 18:14.927
ALMOST TEN YEARS, OPTED TO STAY.

18:14.993 --> 18:15.761
A DECISION THEY SAY CAME WITH A

18:15.828 --> 18:17.296
WARNING.

18:17.362 --> 18:19.264
>> WELL, IF YOU DON'T TAKE THE

18:19.331 --> 18:22.167
BUYOUT, WE ARE GOING TO RENOVATE

18:22.234 --> 18:23.535
THIS AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE

18:23.602 --> 18:24.970
TO LIVE THROUGH THE NIGHTMARE OF

18:25.037 --> 18:26.205
RENOVATION.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.306
>> MONGRAIN SAYS THE UNIT NEXT

18:27.372 --> 18:28.674
TO HER WAS DEMOLISHED WITH A

18:28.740 --> 18:29.741
CROWBAR.

18:29.808 --> 18:30.809
WHEN SHE ASKED ABOUT THE NOISE

18:30.876 --> 18:32.377
AND DEBRIS LEFT BEHIND --

18:32.444 --> 18:34.546
>> ALL THE PERSON SAID WAS, "I

18:34.613 --> 18:35.747
JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW

18:35.814 --> 18:37.316
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF

18:37.382 --> 18:42.154
RATS FROM NOW ON."

18:42.221 --> 18:45.657
>> John: YOU KNOW, IT SAYS A LOT

18:45.724 --> 18:46.725
THAT THEY WOULD ENDURE A

18:46.792 --> 18:47.693
RAT-LITTERED CONSTRUCTION SITE

18:47.759 --> 18:51.964
JUST TO HOLD ONTO A

18:52.030 --> 18:54.700
RENT-STABILIZED UNIT, BECAUSE

18:54.766 --> 18:55.367
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY A WELCOMING

18:55.434 --> 18:56.468
MESSAGE.

18:56.535 --> 18:58.470
IF YOU WENT TO SOMEBODY'S HOME

18:58.537 --> 18:59.238
AND THEIR WELCOME MAT SAID

18:59.304 --> 19:00.272
"THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF

19:00.339 --> 19:02.007
RATS FROM NOW ON," YOU'D DROP

19:02.074 --> 19:02.774
YOUR CASSEROLE DISH THEN AND

19:02.841 --> 19:06.979
THERE AND TURN THE FUCK AROUND.

19:07.045 --> 19:07.946
THEREBY INSTANTLY FALLING RIGHT

19:08.013 --> 19:10.315
INTO THE RATS' TRAP.

19:10.382 --> 19:11.483
[LAUGHTER]

19:11.550 --> 19:12.551
AND IT'S WORTH NOTING: WHEN

19:12.618 --> 19:13.285
RENT-STABILIZED TENANTS DID

19:13.352 --> 19:14.253
LEAVE THAT BUILDING, THE ASKING

19:14.319 --> 19:15.187
RENTS, UNSURPRISINGLY, THEN AS

19:15.254 --> 19:16.121
MUCH AS DOUBLED.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.189
AND I ASSUME THOSE APARTMENTS

19:17.256 --> 19:18.056
WERE THEN SNAPPED UP BY A NICE

19:18.123 --> 19:18.790
YOUNG RAT COUPLE WITH RICH

19:18.857 --> 19:19.691
TASTES AND DISPOSABLE INCOME.

19:19.758 --> 19:20.759
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A PHOTO?

19:20.826 --> 19:21.793
THERE IT IS.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.129
THEY SEEM NICE.

19:24.196 --> 19:25.163
[LAUGHTER]

19:25.230 --> 19:26.732
AND WITH RENTS BEING SQUEEZED

19:26.798 --> 19:27.499
ACROSS THE BOARD, AND

19:27.566 --> 19:29.101
PROTECTIONS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN,

19:29.167 --> 19:30.469
LOWER-INCOME RENTERS ARE,

19:30.536 --> 19:31.770
OBVIOUSLY, THE MOST VULNERABLE.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.238
EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC STRUCK,

19:33.305 --> 19:34.439
23 MILLION PEOPLE LIVED IN

19:34.506 --> 19:35.307
HOUSEHOLDS THAT PAID MORE THAN

19:35.374 --> 19:36.074
HALF THEIR INCOME ON RENT AND

19:36.141 --> 19:37.843
UTILITIES.

19:37.910 --> 19:38.844
WHICH IS JUST NOT SUSTAINABLE

19:38.911 --> 19:40.612
FOR ANYONE.

19:40.679 --> 19:41.914
NOW, IN THEORY, WE HAVE

19:41.980 --> 19:42.614
SOMETHING DESIGNED TO COMBAT

19:42.681 --> 19:44.049
THAT.

19:44.116 --> 19:45.417
FEDERAL HOUSING ASSISTANCE IN

19:45.484 --> 19:46.485
THE FORM OF HOUSING CHOICE

19:46.552 --> 19:47.252
VOUCHERS, COMMONLY KNOWN AS

19:47.319 --> 19:49.187
"SECTION 8."

19:49.254 --> 19:50.522
THE IDEA BEHIND THEM IS THAT A

19:50.589 --> 19:51.690
HOUSEHOLD STILL HAS TO PAY

19:51.757 --> 19:53.358
30% OF ITS MONTHLY INCOME FOR

19:53.425 --> 19:54.826
RENT AND UTILITIES, BUT THE

19:54.893 --> 19:56.028
GOVERNMENT WILL HELP COVER THE

19:56.094 --> 19:59.898
REST.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.266
THE PROBLEM IS, THE PROGRAM IS

20:01.333 --> 20:02.267
MASSIVELY UNDERFUNDED, TO THE

20:02.334 --> 20:03.969
POINT THAT ONLY 1 IN 4

20:04.036 --> 20:04.970
HOUSEHOLDS THAT QUALIFY FOR

20:05.037 --> 20:06.438
ASSISTANCE ACTUALLY RECEIVE IT.

20:06.505 --> 20:07.506
AS WE'VE SHOWN ON THIS SHOW

20:07.573 --> 20:08.974
BEFORE, SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE

20:09.041 --> 20:10.409
LITERALLY RACED TO APPLY FOR

20:10.475 --> 20:11.276
VOUCHERS WHEN THEY BECAME

20:11.343 --> 20:12.945
AVAILABLE.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.313
AND EVEN ONCE YOU'VE APPLIED,

20:14.379 --> 20:15.180
THE WAITING PERIOD CAN BE

20:15.247 --> 20:17.316
ABSURD.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.917
TAKE CHICAGO ALDERWOMAN JEANETTE

20:18.984 --> 20:20.919
TAYLOR, WHOSE APPLICATION TOOK A

20:20.986 --> 20:22.020
RIDICULOUSLY LONG TIME TO BE

20:22.087 --> 20:23.422
APPROVED.

20:23.488 --> 20:24.756
>> WHEN DID YOU APPLY FOR THIS

20:24.823 --> 20:25.591
VOUCHER?

20:25.657 --> 20:27.159
>> IN 1993.

20:27.225 --> 20:30.829
>> AND WHEN DID YOU GET IT?

20:30.896 --> 20:34.366
>> 2022.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.401
SO 29 YEARS.

20:36.468 --> 20:37.202
>> WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION WHEN

20:37.269 --> 20:38.804
YOU GOT THAT LETTER?

20:38.870 --> 20:40.572
>> I JUST SAT ON THE SIDE OF THE

20:40.639 --> 20:42.074
BED FOR LIKE AN HOUR IN SHOCK.

20:42.140 --> 20:42.941
AND I WAS LIKE, GOD, YOU GOT A

20:43.008 --> 20:44.977
SICK SENSE OF HUMOR.

20:45.043 --> 20:46.244
>> John: I MEAN, SHE'S RIGHT,

20:46.311 --> 20:49.481
HE DOES.

20:49.548 --> 20:50.282
ALTHOUGH TO BE HONEST, I PREFER

20:50.349 --> 20:51.483
GOD'S EARLY STUFF.

20:51.550 --> 20:52.250
CONVINCING ABRAHAM TO ALMOST

20:52.317 --> 20:53.752
KILL HIS SON AS A PRANK?

20:53.819 --> 20:54.920
VERY FUNNY.

20:54.987 --> 20:55.921
FLOODING THE WORLD AND MAKING

20:55.988 --> 20:57.556
ONE GUY GET EVERY ANIMAL SPECIES

20:57.623 --> 20:58.523
TO FUCK ON A BOAT?

20:58.590 --> 21:00.892
HILARIOUS!

21:00.959 --> 21:02.127
[LAUGHTER]

21:02.194 --> 21:03.028
BUT A HOUSING VOUCHER THAT'S 29

21:03.095 --> 21:04.329
YEARS LATE?

21:04.396 --> 21:05.230
I DUNNO.

21:05.297 --> 21:07.566
THAT DOES START TO FEEL LIKE

21:07.633 --> 21:09.034
GOD'S RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.135
AND EVEN IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH

21:10.202 --> 21:11.069
TO GET A VOUCHER, YOU STILL THEN

21:11.136 --> 21:12.337
HAVE TO FIND A LANDLORD WILLING

21:12.404 --> 21:13.772
TO ACCEPT IT.

21:13.839 --> 21:15.040
BUT MANY LANDLORDS DON'T, EITHER

21:15.107 --> 21:16.174
BECAUSE THEY SEE IT AS A

21:16.241 --> 21:17.809
BUREAUCRATIC HASSLE, OR BECAUSE

21:17.876 --> 21:19.411
THEY HAVE A STIGMA AGAINST

21:19.478 --> 21:20.612
SECTION 8 RECIPIENTS, ALL OF

21:20.679 --> 21:21.913
WHICH LEADS TO A LOT OF STORIES

21:21.980 --> 21:23.949
LIKE THIS:

21:24.016 --> 21:27.285
>> I WAS BLESSED WITH A HOMING

21:27.352 --> 21:30.555
CHOICE VOUCHER IN APRIL, AND I

21:30.622 --> 21:31.823
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND A

21:31.890 --> 21:33.692
SPOT.

21:33.759 --> 21:34.960
I CALLED OVER 200 PLACES THAT

21:35.027 --> 21:36.695
WOULD SUPPOSEDLY TAKE THE

21:36.762 --> 21:37.996
VOUCHER, AND NONE OF THOSE

21:38.063 --> 21:39.331
PLACES WERE ACTUALLY RENTING.

21:39.398 --> 21:40.832
>> HOW MANY PLACES DO YOU THINK

21:40.899 --> 21:43.402
YOU GOT TURNED DOWN FROM?

21:43.468 --> 21:45.337
>> JESUS, AT LEAST 15.

21:45.404 --> 21:47.005
>> 15 PLACES TURNED YOU DOWN?

21:47.072 --> 21:48.573
>> IF NOT MORE.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.742
IT'S LIKE I HAVE A PLAGUE.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.644
IT'S LIKE WE HAVE A PLAGUE.

21:52.711 --> 21:53.278
>> EVERYWHERE YOU TURN, NO

21:53.345 --> 21:54.579
SECTION 8.

21:54.646 --> 21:55.714
I'VE CALLED UP 50 APARTMENT

21:55.781 --> 21:57.816
COMPLEXES IN SACRAMENTO.

21:57.883 --> 21:58.517
THEY DON'T LOOK AT ME AS AN

21:58.583 --> 22:00.719
INDIVIDUAL.

22:00.786 --> 22:01.653
I'M ON SECTION 8, THEREFORE I'M

22:01.720 --> 22:03.121
POOR.

22:03.188 --> 22:05.123
THEREFORE, I'M BAD.

22:05.190 --> 22:06.858
>> John: THAT IS TERRIBLE.

22:06.925 --> 22:07.759
BECAUSE EVEN THE WORST PEOPLE

22:07.826 --> 22:09.194
WILL HONOR VOUCHERS.

22:09.261 --> 22:10.662
TAKE WILLY WONKA.

22:10.729 --> 22:12.030
SURE, HE MAY HAVE RUN A

22:12.097 --> 22:13.365
SWEATSHOP WITH HORRIBLE SAFETY

22:13.432 --> 22:14.833
PROTOCOLS THAT PUT CHILDREN'S

22:14.900 --> 22:17.469
LIVES IN DANGER, BUT EVEN HE HAD

22:17.536 --> 22:18.236
THE DECENCY TO HONOR THE FUCKING

22:18.303 --> 22:20.305
VOUCHERS!

22:20.372 --> 22:22.140
[LAUGHTER]

22:22.207 --> 22:26.745
NOW, DISCRIMINATION AGAINST

22:26.812 --> 22:30.982
THOSE WITH SECTION 8 VOUCHERS IS

22:31.049 --> 22:31.883
ILLEGAL, IN SOME PLACES.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.185
BUT EVEN WHERE THAT'S THE CASE,

22:33.251 --> 22:34.319
LANDLORDS CAN JUST INVENT OTHER

22:34.386 --> 22:35.087
REASONS TO TURN PEOPLE AWAY.

22:35.153 --> 22:36.455
AND WITH HOUSING THIS TIGHT,

22:36.521 --> 22:37.522
RENTS SKYROCKETING, AND

22:37.589 --> 22:38.356
LANDLORDS HOLDING THIS MUCH

22:38.423 --> 22:39.424
POWER, LOW-INCOME RENTERS CAN BE

22:39.491 --> 22:40.759
LEFT VULNERABLE TO THE NIGHTMARE

22:40.826 --> 22:41.660
SCENARIO: EVICTION.

22:41.727 --> 22:42.594
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EVICTIONS ON

22:42.661 --> 22:43.428
THIS SHOW BEFORE.

22:43.495 --> 22:44.696
THEY'RE INVASIVE, TRAUMATIZING,

22:44.763 --> 22:46.631
AND LIKE ALL THE OTHER PERILS OF

22:46.698 --> 22:47.232
RENTING, DISPROPORTIONATELY

22:47.299 --> 22:48.633
AFFECT BLACK PEOPLE.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.868
ONE STUDY OF MORE THAN A

22:49.935 --> 22:51.870
THOUSAND COUNTIES FOUND BLACK

22:51.937 --> 22:53.739
RENTERS MADE UP AROUND 20% OF

22:53.805 --> 22:55.474
ALL ADULT RENTERS, BUT NEARLY A

22:55.540 --> 22:56.575
THIRD OF ALL EVICTION FILING

22:56.641 --> 22:58.009
DEFENDANTS.

22:58.076 --> 22:59.778
AND PERHAPS NOWHERE DEMONSTRATES

22:59.845 --> 23:01.413
THE ENORMOUS POWER IMBALANCE

23:01.480 --> 23:02.647
BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS

23:02.714 --> 23:05.350
MORE THAN HOUSING COURT.

23:05.417 --> 23:06.184
STARTING WITH THE FACT THAT, IN

23:06.251 --> 23:08.286
MOST PLACES, TENANTS DON'T HAVE

23:08.353 --> 23:09.488
A RIGHT TO A LAWYER IN EVICTION

23:09.554 --> 23:10.489
PROCEEDINGS.

23:10.555 --> 23:11.790
AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN

23:11.857 --> 23:13.558
ATTORNEY TO GUIDE YOU THROUGH

23:13.625 --> 23:15.861
WHAT CAN BE A COMPLEX PROCESS,

23:15.927 --> 23:17.662
NOT ONLY CAN YOU FAIL TO RAISE

23:17.729 --> 23:18.730
LEGITIMATE DEFENSES, YOU CAN

23:18.797 --> 23:19.798
MAKE BASIC MISTAKES WITH HUGE

23:19.865 --> 23:22.000
CONSEQUENCES.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.235
>> GINA COMES ACROSS A TENANT

23:23.301 --> 23:27.305
SITTING DISTRAUGHT.

23:27.372 --> 23:32.644
>> SO SHE CAME TO COURT, SHE

23:32.711 --> 23:33.578
CAME TO COURT EARLY AND AS

23:33.645 --> 23:34.713
HAPPENS SOMETIMES BECAUSE COURT

23:34.780 --> 23:35.313
IS CONFUSING, SHE SAT IN THE

23:35.380 --> 23:36.948
WRONG COURTROOM.

23:37.015 --> 23:37.749
>> WHILE HER CASE WAS HEARD IN A

23:37.816 --> 23:39.484
DIFFERENT COURTROOM.

23:39.551 --> 23:40.285
WHEN SHE REALIZED HER

23:40.352 --> 23:41.520
MISTAKE, SHE DASHED OVER AND

23:41.586 --> 23:42.420
CAUGHT THE LANDLORD OUTSIDE, BUT

23:42.487 --> 23:43.155
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SPEAK WITH

23:43.221 --> 23:44.222
HER.

23:44.289 --> 23:45.423
>> AND THE COURT INFORMED HER

23:45.490 --> 23:46.558
THAT AFTER TEN DAYS, THE SHERIFF

23:46.625 --> 23:47.225
WOULD COME IN AND REMOVE HER AND

23:47.292 --> 23:47.993
HER THREE CHILDREN FROM HER

23:48.059 --> 23:49.828
HOME.

23:49.895 --> 23:51.463
>> John: ONE TINY MISTAKE AND

23:51.530 --> 23:53.131
HER HOUSING WAS GONE.

23:53.198 --> 23:55.066
WHICH IS CLEARLY UNFAIR.

23:55.133 --> 23:56.234
THE ONLY TIME SOMEONE SHOULD BE

23:56.301 --> 23:57.369
PUNISHED FOR GOING INTO THE

23:57.435 --> 23:58.770
WRONG ROOM IS WHEN THEY

23:58.837 --> 23:59.805
ACCIDENTALLY STUMBLE INTO THE

23:59.871 --> 24:00.839
3:30 SHOWING OF "DOWNTON ABBEY:

24:00.906 --> 24:04.142
A NEW ERA."

24:04.209 --> 24:04.810
[LAUGHTER]

24:04.876 --> 24:06.144
GET READY FOR A LONG, BORING

24:06.211 --> 24:06.845
RIDE.

24:06.912 --> 24:07.779
"BUT JOHN, IT'S DELIGHTFUL

24:07.846 --> 24:09.080
BECAUSE THEY'RE BRITISH!"

24:09.147 --> 24:12.150
COUNTERPOINT: IT IS NOT.

24:12.217 --> 24:13.585
[LAUGHTER]

24:13.652 --> 24:14.786
ONE STUDY OF NEARLY 100,000

24:14.853 --> 24:15.754
EVICTION CASES IN DENVER FOUND

24:15.821 --> 24:17.088
THAT NEARLY 90% OF LANDLORDS

24:17.155 --> 24:18.623
WERE REPRESENTED BY A LAWYER,

24:18.690 --> 24:19.658
COMPARED TO LESS THAN 1% OF

24:19.724 --> 24:21.493
TENANTS.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.961
WHICH IS NOT GOOD.

24:23.028 --> 24:24.863
AND YET, SOME ATTORNEYS WHO WORK

24:24.930 --> 24:28.633
FOR LANDLORDS GET VERY ANGRY AT

24:28.700 --> 24:29.668
THE SUGGESTION THAT TENANTS ARE

24:29.734 --> 24:30.468
POORLY PROTECTED.

24:30.535 --> 24:34.773
TAKE THIS GUY, WHO REPRESENTS

24:34.840 --> 24:35.807
MULTIPLE LANDLORDS IN ST. LOUIS.

24:35.874 --> 24:36.675
HE'S A SELF-STYLED GURU FOR THE

24:36.741 --> 24:37.375
REAL ESTATE BAR.

24:37.442 --> 24:38.343
AND JUST LISTEN TO HIM GIVING A

24:38.410 --> 24:39.411
ZOOM SEMINAR ABOUT EVICTIONS,

24:39.477 --> 24:40.712
AND ROLLING HIS EYES AT SOME OF

24:40.779 --> 24:41.613
THE BASIC LEGAL PROTECTIONS

24:41.680 --> 24:42.714
EXTENDED TO RENTERS DURING

24:42.781 --> 24:44.749
COVID.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.852
>> THE ADVOCATES FOR THE TENANTS

24:46.918 --> 24:49.187
ARE LIKE, "YOU KNOW, THESE

24:49.254 --> 24:50.856
PEOPLE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

24:50.922 --> 24:52.224
AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THEY DON'T

24:52.290 --> 24:53.425
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE CDC

24:53.491 --> 24:54.492
DECLARATION."

24:54.559 --> 24:55.660
[BLEEP] THEM!

24:55.727 --> 24:59.865
[BLEEP] THEM ALL!

24:59.931 --> 25:00.899
THEY'RE TOO STUPID TO KNOW WHAT

25:00.966 --> 25:01.766
THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS ARE?

25:01.833 --> 25:03.435
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE SIGNED A

25:03.501 --> 25:05.737
[BLEEP] CONTRACT FOR

25:05.804 --> 25:10.976
$1,000-A-MONTH UNIT FOR A YEAR

25:11.042 --> 25:12.711
IF THEY'RE TOO [BLEEP] STUPID TO

25:12.777 --> 25:14.412
SIGN, TO KNOW ANYTHING, TO READ

25:14.479 --> 25:16.548
THE NEWS, TO HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT

25:16.615 --> 25:18.149
THEIR RIGHTS!

25:18.216 --> 25:20.118
IF THEY'RE TOO [BLEEP] STUPID,

25:20.185 --> 25:21.052
THEY SHOULDN'T BE SIGNING THE

25:21.119 --> 25:23.722
$12,000 CONTRACT.

25:23.788 --> 25:25.056
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, THAT IS

25:25.123 --> 25:25.790
DEFINITELY THE ANGRIEST I'VE

25:25.857 --> 25:26.758
EVER SEEN ANYONE WEARING A

25:26.825 --> 25:29.494
"RUSH" HAT.

25:29.561 --> 25:30.161
[LAUGHTER]

25:30.228 --> 25:31.329
AND SECOND, THERE IS NO DOUBT

25:31.396 --> 25:32.864
THAT MAN, AT SOME POINT, HAS

25:32.931 --> 25:33.832
BEEN KICKED OUT OF A YOUTH

25:33.899 --> 25:35.433
SOCCER GAME.

25:35.500 --> 25:36.668
HE JUST EXUDES "REF, I'D LIKE A

25:36.735 --> 25:38.670
WORD" ENERGY.

25:38.737 --> 25:40.338
I GUARANTEE THAT IS A MAN WHO

25:40.405 --> 25:42.474
HAS THROWN A LAWN CHAIR, OR AT

25:42.540 --> 25:43.508
THE VERY LEAST, SQUEEZED A

25:43.575 --> 25:44.809
KOOL-AID JAMMER SO TIGHT IN HIS

25:44.876 --> 25:46.044
FISTS, THE OTHER PARENTS THOUGHT

25:46.111 --> 25:52.484
HIS HAND WAS COVERED IN BLOOD.

25:52.550 --> 25:53.184
BESIDES THAT, I WILL SAY, HE

25:53.251 --> 25:54.152
SEEMS LIKE A COOL GUY.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.186
[LAUGHTER]

25:55.253 --> 25:56.187
SO THAT IS WHAT TENANTS CAN BE

25:56.254 --> 25:56.988
UP AGAINST.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.189
AND THE PROBLEM IS, EVICTION

25:58.256 --> 25:58.924
FILINGS CAN BE ON YOUR RECORD

25:58.990 --> 25:59.758
FOR YEARS, JEOPARDIZING YOUR

25:59.824 --> 26:01.092
CHANCE AT FUTURE HOUSING.

26:01.159 --> 26:01.993
JUST WATCH AS THIS WOMAN

26:02.060 --> 26:05.230
CONTACTS A REALTOR ABOUT A HOME

26:05.297 --> 26:06.164
THAT SHE'S INTERESTED IN.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.198
>> DID YOU GET A CHANCE TO DRIVE

26:07.265 --> 26:08.166
BY AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT?

26:08.233 --> 26:09.567
>> YEAH, I'M SITTING IN FRONT OF

26:09.634 --> 26:11.202
THE HOME RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK.

26:11.269 --> 26:12.203
>> OKAY.

26:12.270 --> 26:13.438
AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

26:13.505 --> 26:14.572
>> MARGARET.

26:14.639 --> 26:16.241
>> OKAY, MARGARET.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.208
AND HOW SOON ARE YOU LOOKING TO

26:17.275 --> 26:18.910
MOVE INTO A HOME?

26:18.977 --> 26:20.645
>> AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

26:20.712 --> 26:22.914
RIGHT NOW.

26:22.981 --> 26:24.215
>> ARE YOU ON A LEASE WHERE

26:24.282 --> 26:25.583
YOU'RE LIVING AT RIGHT NOW?

26:25.650 --> 26:26.651
>> NO, AS A MATTER OF FACT,

26:26.718 --> 26:28.553
WE'RE NOT.

26:28.620 --> 26:32.223
WE'RE ACTUALLY HOMELESS.

26:32.290 --> 26:33.058
>> OKAY, SO WHERE ARE YOU

26:33.124 --> 26:34.893
CURRENTLY LIVING?

26:34.960 --> 26:38.596
>> IN OUR VEHICLE.

26:38.663 --> 26:40.532
>> YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN WE

26:40.598 --> 26:41.866
CHECK THE COURT RECORDS AND SEE

26:41.933 --> 26:42.801
AN EVICTION, UNFORTUNATELY, WE

26:42.867 --> 26:44.836
CAN'T HELP YOU.

26:44.903 --> 26:46.271
>> John: LOOK, THERE ARE SOME

26:46.338 --> 26:46.972
THINGS THAT SHOULD PROBABLY STAY

26:47.038 --> 26:48.773
ON YOUR RECORD.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.241
LIKE WAR CRIMES, OR VOTING FOR

26:50.308 --> 26:51.576
TAYLOR HICKS IN THE 2006 SEASON

26:51.643 --> 26:54.179
OF "AMERICAN IDOL."

26:54.245 --> 26:54.980
[LAUGHTER]

26:55.046 --> 26:56.381
YOU SHOULDN'T GET TO COME BACK

26:56.448 --> 26:58.750
FROM THAT SO EASILY.

26:58.817 --> 26:59.417
BUT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE

26:59.484 --> 27:00.585
TO FIND SAFE AND AFFORDABLE

27:00.652 --> 27:01.419
HOUSING, SINCE THE ALTERNATIVE

27:01.486 --> 27:03.054
IS BEING HOMELESS!

27:03.121 --> 27:04.222
AND THE THING IS, YOU CAN BE

27:04.289 --> 27:05.490
TURNED DOWN FOR HOUSING SIMPLY

27:05.557 --> 27:07.325
BECAUSE AN EVICTION CASE WAS

27:07.392 --> 27:09.260
FILED AGAINST YOU, EVEN IF THAT

27:09.327 --> 27:10.562
CASE WAS LATER DROPPED, OR

27:10.628 --> 27:12.897
INDEED, YOU WON IT.

27:12.964 --> 27:13.865
THE LONG-TERM DAMAGE THAT

27:13.932 --> 27:15.633
EVICTION FILINGS DO TO YOUR

27:15.700 --> 27:17.769
RECORD IS WHY MANY WILL CHOOSE

27:17.836 --> 27:18.403
NOT TO FIGHT WHEN A LANDLORD

27:18.470 --> 27:20.071
TRIES TO KICK THEM OUT.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.239
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE

27:21.306 --> 27:22.307
CAN WIND UP WITH A SO-CALLED

27:22.374 --> 27:24.042
"INFORMAL" EVICTION.

27:24.109 --> 27:25.310
THAT'S WHERE THEIR LANDLORD DOES

27:25.377 --> 27:26.111
THINGS LIKE CHANGE THE LOCKS,

27:26.177 --> 27:27.178
THREATEN THEM, OR EVEN REMOVE

27:27.245 --> 27:31.516
THE FRONT DOOR.

27:31.583 --> 27:32.517
IT IS HARD TO MEASURE JUST HOW

27:32.584 --> 27:33.852
MANY OF THESE TAKE PLACE EACH

27:33.918 --> 27:34.886
YEAR, BUT A SURVEY OF MILWAUKEE

27:34.953 --> 27:35.653
RENTERS FOUND THAT FOR EVERY

27:35.720 --> 27:36.621
EVICTION EXECUTED THROUGH THE

27:36.688 --> 27:37.922
JUDICIAL SYSTEM, THERE ARE TWO

27:37.989 --> 27:39.157
OTHERS EXECUTED OUTSIDE THE

27:39.224 --> 27:40.058
COURT, WITHOUT ANY FORM OF DUE

27:40.125 --> 27:42.727
PROCESS.

27:42.794 --> 27:44.462
AND GIVEN JUST HOW DEVASTATING

27:44.529 --> 27:45.830
EVICTIONS CAN BE, IT IS

27:45.897 --> 27:47.365
INFURIATING TO HEAR HOW SOME

27:47.432 --> 27:49.501
INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS VIEW IT.

27:49.567 --> 27:50.301
REMEMBER THAT SCREAMING RUSH FAN

27:50.368 --> 27:51.836
FROM EARLIER?

27:51.903 --> 27:53.605
WELL, IT TURNS OUT, HE ACTUALLY

27:53.671 --> 27:55.940
HAS A LITTLE MORE TO SAY.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.275
>> IT'S SAD TO SAY, AND SOME OF

27:57.342 --> 27:59.044
YOU WHO ARE NOT LANDLORDS MIGHT

27:59.110 --> 28:01.880
BE SHOCKED TO HEAR, WE EVICT

28:01.946 --> 28:04.716
GRANDPARENTS WHO ARE POOR.

28:04.783 --> 28:06.484
WE EVICT CANCER-STRICKEN PEOPLE

28:06.551 --> 28:10.321
WHO ARE ATTENDING CHEMO.

28:10.388 --> 28:13.158
IT'S SAD, BUT WHAT'S SADDER IS

28:13.224 --> 28:15.760
THAT SOMEBODY WHO PURCHASES

28:15.827 --> 28:18.096
PROPERTY FOR HUNDREDS OF

28:18.163 --> 28:19.597
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IS GIVEN

28:19.664 --> 28:22.467
THE FINGER BY THE LAW.

28:22.534 --> 28:26.371
>> John: EXCEPT IT'S NOT SADDER.

28:26.438 --> 28:27.472
[LAUGHTER]

28:27.539 --> 28:28.740
IT'S JUST NOT.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.241
ON THE GREAT BIG LIST OF SAD

28:30.308 --> 28:31.276
THINGS: PERSON GETTING EVICTED

28:31.342 --> 28:32.510
DURING CHEMO IS UP THERE WITH

28:32.577 --> 28:33.778
DOG DEATHS AND THE FIRST TEN

28:33.845 --> 28:36.881
MINUTES OF "UP."

28:36.948 --> 28:39.884
WHILE LANDLORD DOESN'T GET

28:39.951 --> 28:43.021
RENT IS AT THE VERY BOTTOM, WITH

28:43.088 --> 28:48.359
CELEBRITY TWEETS ABOUT A SHITTY

28:48.426 --> 28:50.328
AIRLINE EXPERIENCE AND WHITE GUY

28:50.395 --> 28:52.430
NOT ALLOWED TO RAP ALL THE

28:52.497 --> 28:54.165
LYRICS.

28:54.232 --> 28:54.766
IT'S OBJECTIVELY NOT SAD, AT

28:54.833 --> 28:55.767
ALL.

28:55.834 --> 28:56.568
THAT IS THE CORE ISSUE WITH

28:56.634 --> 28:58.369
RENTAL HOUSING IN THIS COUNTRY:

28:58.436 --> 28:59.304
PEOPLE WHO THINK INVESTMENTS

28:59.370 --> 29:01.072
DESERVE MORE RESPECT THAN BASIC

29:01.139 --> 29:02.574
HUMAN NEEDS.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.209
AND IT HAS SET UP A SYSTEM

29:04.275 --> 29:05.343
DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT SOME

29:05.410 --> 29:06.544
PEOPLE JUST SPIRAL DOWNWARDS:

29:06.611 --> 29:07.579
THEY CAN'T MOVE SOMEWHERE

29:07.645 --> 29:08.613
CHEAPER IF NOWHERE CHEAPER

29:08.680 --> 29:09.647
EXISTS.

29:09.714 --> 29:10.715
THEY CAN'T APPLY FOR FEDERAL

29:10.782 --> 29:11.950
ASSISTANCE IF THERE'S NOWHERE

29:12.016 --> 29:12.717
NEAR ENOUGH.

29:12.784 --> 29:13.852
THEY CAN'T EVEN USE THAT

29:13.918 --> 29:14.786
ASSISTANCE IF NO ONE ACCEPTS IT.

29:14.853 --> 29:16.121
THEY CAN'T TAKE THEIR

29:16.187 --> 29:17.122
LANDLORD TO COURT IF THE COURT

29:17.188 --> 29:17.989
SYSTEM IS SKEWED AGAINST THEM.

29:18.056 --> 29:18.923
AND THEY CAN'T DEPEND ON RENTAL

29:18.990 --> 29:19.924
HOUSING EVER AGAIN IF THEY'RE

29:19.991 --> 29:20.758
EVICTED EVEN JUST ONCE.

29:20.825 --> 29:21.926
IT'S A COMPLETE SHIT SHOW.

29:21.993 --> 29:22.961
SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?

29:23.027 --> 29:24.095
WELL, THERE ARE SOME SMALL

29:24.162 --> 29:24.896
THINGS.

29:24.963 --> 29:26.397
WE COULD PASS RENT-STABILIZATION

29:26.464 --> 29:27.532
LAWS, AND LAWS THAT PROHIBIT

29:27.599 --> 29:28.900
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST

29:28.967 --> 29:30.535
RECIPIENTS OF HOUSING CHOICE

29:30.602 --> 29:31.202
VOUCHERS, AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR

29:31.269 --> 29:32.637
LANDLORDS TO ACCEPT THEM.

29:32.704 --> 29:34.038
WE ALSO COULD PASS LAWS

29:34.105 --> 29:35.106
MANDATING THE SEALING OF MOST

29:35.173 --> 29:36.508
EVICTION RECORDS, AND GIVE

29:36.574 --> 29:37.542
PEOPLE A RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN

29:37.609 --> 29:38.943
HOUSING COURT.

29:39.010 --> 29:40.078
THAT ALONE CAN HAVE MASSIVE

29:40.145 --> 29:42.046
IMPACTS.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.648
IN 2017, AFTER SUSTAINED

29:43.715 --> 29:44.949
PRESSURE, NEW YORK CITY BECAME

29:45.016 --> 29:46.818
THE FIRST PLACE IN THE COUNTRY

29:46.885 --> 29:47.719
TO GIVE TENANTS THE RIGHT TO A

29:47.785 --> 29:49.988
LAWYER IN HOUSING COURT.

29:50.054 --> 29:51.022
IT IS A MAJOR REASON WHY, EVEN

29:51.089 --> 29:53.291
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC MORATORIUMS,

29:53.358 --> 29:54.592
RESIDENTIAL EVICTIONS WERE DOWN

29:54.659 --> 29:56.461
40%.

29:56.528 --> 29:57.862
AND LUCKILY, OTHER PLACES ARE

29:57.929 --> 29:59.464
NOW FOLLOWING THAT LEAD.

29:59.531 --> 30:01.399
BUT I WOULD ARGUE WHAT WE REALLY

30:01.466 --> 30:03.234
NEED TO DO IS FUNDAMENTALLY

30:03.301 --> 30:04.802
CHANGE OUR MINDSET AWAY FROM

30:04.869 --> 30:06.838
SIMPLY HOPING THAT WE CAN JUST

30:06.905 --> 30:08.106
TINKER AROUND THE EDGES OF

30:08.173 --> 30:13.678
HOUSING POLICY AND THE PRIVATE

30:13.745 --> 30:14.646
MARKET WILL SORT THE REST OF

30:14.712 --> 30:16.247
THIS SHIT OUT.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.715
BECAUSE WE'VE TRIED THAT FOR

30:17.782 --> 30:18.950
DECADES, AND YET, HERE WE ARE.

30:19.017 --> 30:20.318
INSTEAD, WE NEED TO AGREE:

30:20.385 --> 30:21.686
HOUSING IS A HUMAN RIGHT.

30:21.753 --> 30:23.388
AND THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY JUST

30:23.454 --> 30:24.656
SOME EMPTY SLOGAN LIKE SUBWAY'S

30:24.722 --> 30:25.623
"EAT FRESH", OR GATORADE'S

30:25.690 --> 30:26.824
"IS IT IN YOU?"

30:26.891 --> 30:27.825
WHICH, LOOKING BACK, WAS VERY,

30:27.892 --> 30:29.027
VERY WEIRD.

30:29.093 --> 30:34.365
[LAUGHTER]

30:34.432 --> 30:35.466
THIS CAN ACTUALLY BE POLICY.

30:35.533 --> 30:36.267
MANY COUNTRIES, INCLUDING

30:36.334 --> 30:37.235
FRANCE, SCOTLAND, AND SOUTH

30:37.302 --> 30:38.203
AFRICA HAVE LEGALLY CODIFIED A

30:38.269 --> 30:39.270
RIGHT TO HOUSING.

30:39.337 --> 30:40.405
AND HERE IN THE U.S., 3/4 OF

30:40.471 --> 30:41.406
AMERICANS ALREADY BELIEVE THAT

30:41.472 --> 30:43.808
IT IS A HUMAN RIGHT.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.310
AS FOR WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN, IT

30:45.376 --> 30:46.878
WOULD ENTAIL A MASSIVE FEDERAL

30:46.945 --> 30:48.913
INVESTMENT IN RENTAL ASSISTANCE,

30:48.980 --> 30:50.148
AND THE CREATION OF MUCH MORE

30:50.215 --> 30:51.216
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS ACROSS

30:51.282 --> 30:53.051
THE BOARD.

30:53.117 --> 30:55.853
AND BEFORE ANYONE SUGGESTS WE

30:55.920 --> 30:57.055
CAN'T AFFORD THAT: WE ALREADY

30:57.121 --> 30:57.922
SUBSIDIZE CERTAIN PEOPLE'S

30:57.989 --> 30:59.557
HOMES.

30:59.624 --> 31:00.725
THE MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION

31:00.792 --> 31:01.659
GIVES MASSIVE SUBSIDIES TO

31:01.726 --> 31:02.794
HOMEOWNERS, BY LETTING THEM

31:02.860 --> 31:04.028
DEDUCT THE INTEREST THAT THEY

31:04.095 --> 31:04.796
PAY ON THEIR MORTGAGE ON THEIR

31:04.862 --> 31:05.997
TAXES.

31:06.064 --> 31:07.165
THAT HAS COST THE FEDERAL

31:07.232 --> 31:08.733
GOVERNMENT MORE THAN

31:08.800 --> 31:09.968
$580 BILLION OVER THE LAST

31:10.034 --> 31:12.170
DECADE.

31:12.237 --> 31:13.438
AND CURRENTLY, NEARLY 2/3 OF THE

31:13.504 --> 31:15.373
DEDUCTION'S BENEFITS ARE GOING

31:15.440 --> 31:16.341
TO THOSE MAKING $200,000 OR MORE

31:16.407 --> 31:18.743
A YEAR.

31:18.810 --> 31:20.445
I AM BENEFITING FROM THIS

31:20.511 --> 31:23.815
PROGRAM AND I DO NOT NEED TO BE!

31:23.881 --> 31:24.916
SO WE ARE CLEARLY WILLING TO

31:24.983 --> 31:26.317
PRIORITIZE HOUSING IN THE

31:26.384 --> 31:27.452
BUDGET, JUST NOT FOR THE PEOPLE

31:27.518 --> 31:30.755
WHO NEED IT THE MOST.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.090
THE POINT HERE IS, FOR A LARGE

31:32.156 --> 31:32.924
PORTION OF THE POPULATION,

31:32.991 --> 31:34.225
SIMPLY HAVING A PLACE TO LIVE IS

31:34.292 --> 31:35.126
AN EVERYDAY BATTLE.

31:35.193 --> 31:36.394
AND FOR FAR TOO LONG, WE'VE

31:36.461 --> 31:38.363
PRIORITIZED THE PROTECTION OF

31:38.429 --> 31:40.498
INVESTMENTS OVER INDIVIDUALS,

31:40.565 --> 31:42.500
AND WE'VE SET UP A SYSTEM WHERE

31:42.567 --> 31:43.835
LANDLORDS CAN "PRESS RENTS AND

31:43.901 --> 31:45.403
RESET MARKET RATES," AND JUSTIFY

31:45.470 --> 31:47.005
THEIR ACTIONS WITH SELF-SERVING

31:47.071 --> 31:48.840
BIBLE READINGS, EVEN AS THEY

31:48.906 --> 31:50.241
SUBJECT TENANTS TO EVERYTHING

31:50.308 --> 31:52.210
FROM TACTICAL RAT ASSAULTS TO

31:52.277 --> 31:53.778
THE INCOHERENT RAGE OF THE

31:53.845 --> 31:56.047
SINGLE MOST FOUL-MOUTHED FAN

31:56.114 --> 31:57.815
ONTARIO'S PREMIERE PROG ROCK

31:57.882 --> 31:58.683
POWER TRIO HAS EVER FUCKING

31:58.750 --> 32:00.685
KNOWN.

32:00.752 --> 32:01.986
[LAUGHTER]

32:02.053 --> 32:03.821
AND NOW, THIS.

32:03.888 --> 32:05.757
>> Announcer: AND NOW, IT'S

32:05.823 --> 32:08.660
ALWAYS HAPPY HOUR ON QVC.

32:08.726 --> 32:09.794
>> I THINK YOU JUST LOOK SO

32:09.861 --> 32:12.397
GREAT IN IT, AMY.

32:12.463 --> 32:13.264
IT'S LIKE CASUAL BUT THERE'S AN

32:13.331 --> 32:14.332
UPDATED ELEGANCE TO IT, AND OF

32:14.399 --> 32:15.500
COURSE, I HAD TO STOP BY WITH

32:15.566 --> 32:16.367
WINE BECAUSE I MISSED YOU GUYS

32:16.434 --> 32:16.768
LAST WEEK!

32:16.834 --> 32:18.970
>> WE LOVE YOU.

32:19.037 --> 32:20.538
>> TRACY, THANKS FOR SWINGING BY

32:20.605 --> 32:22.240
AND I WILL SWING BY AND BRING

32:22.307 --> 32:23.174
YOU SOME MORE WINE LATER ON.

32:23.241 --> 32:24.008
>> IT'S JUST ME, A FEW BOTTLES

32:24.075 --> 32:25.877
OF WINE.

32:25.943 --> 32:30.682
I'M A MOM AND I ENJOY A NICE

32:30.748 --> 32:32.517
GLASS OF MY WINE SOMETIMES.

32:32.583 --> 32:33.117
>> LITERALLY TOOK A SIP OF THE

32:33.184 --> 32:36.621
WINE.

32:36.688 --> 32:39.624
I JUST WANT THAT FOR THE RECORD.

32:39.691 --> 32:40.525
IT'S NOT A PROP.

32:40.591 --> 32:41.326
>> WE ARE GOING TO BRING IN

32:41.392 --> 32:42.226
JACKIE STAFFORD!

32:42.293 --> 32:42.994
>> OH, SHE HAS WINE!

32:43.061 --> 32:43.895
>> OH, MY GOD!

32:43.961 --> 32:46.964
>> AND THEY SAID "WINE?"

32:47.031 --> 32:48.132
AND I SAID, UH, YEAH!

32:48.199 --> 32:48.800
>> I NEED A HAND, I NEED A GLASS

32:48.866 --> 32:50.468
OF WINE.

32:50.535 --> 32:52.637
>> THERE YOU ARE.

32:52.704 --> 32:55.039
>> WE HAVE WINE IN OUR TEACUPS.

32:55.106 --> 33:00.278
>> WE HAVE ONE IN OUR TEACUPS.

33:00.345 --> 33:06.284
WE ARE HAVING A TEA PARTY.

33:06.351 --> 33:07.218
>> IS THERE WINE IN THE TEACUP?

33:07.285 --> 33:07.952
>> LOVE YOU!

33:08.019 --> 33:08.586
>> ALL RIGHT, I LOVE YOU.

33:08.653 --> 33:09.187
>> I LOVE YOU.

33:09.253 --> 33:10.988
>> AND WE ARE GOING TO GO

33:11.055 --> 33:11.689
SHOPPING FOR WINE!

33:11.756 --> 33:12.457
>> LET ME BRING MY OWN BOTTLE OF

33:12.523 --> 33:15.893
WINE AND I WILL BE HERE.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.295
>> RIGHT HERE WITH MY GLASS OF

33:17.362 --> 33:17.929
WINE.

33:17.995 --> 33:18.563
>> IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO BE

33:18.629 --> 33:19.130
HERE.

33:19.197 --> 33:19.931
I THINK I LOST MY WINE.

33:19.997 --> 33:20.765
OH, YOU HAVE YOUR WINE?
