00:49.713 --> 00:52.113
SAGAN:
<i>There are two ways to view the stars:</i>

00:52.315 --> 00:56.445
<i>As they really are</i>
<i>and as we might wish them to be.</i>

00:56.653 --> 00:58.883
<i>There are the Pleiades...</i>

00:59.089 --> 01:01.785
<i>... a group of young stars</i>
<i>astronomers recognize...</i>

01:01.991 --> 01:06.519
<i>... as leaving their stellar nurseries</i>
<i>of gas and dust.</i>

01:09.366 --> 01:11.561
<i>And this is the Crab Nebula...</i>

01:11.768 --> 01:13.861
<i>... a stellar graveyard,</i>
<i>where gas and dust...</i>

01:14.070 --> 01:16.971
<i>... are being dispersed back</i>
<i>into the interstellar medium.</i>

01:17.173 --> 01:20.438
<i>Inside it is a dying pulsar.</i>

01:23.012 --> 01:25.310
<i>Both the Pleiades</i>
<i>and the Crab Nebula...</i>

01:25.749 --> 01:28.775
<i>... are in a constellation</i>
<i>astrologers long ago named...</i>

01:28.985 --> 01:31.146
<i>... Taurus the Bull.</i>

01:31.354 --> 01:34.812
<i>They imagined it</i>
<i>to influence our daily lives.</i>

01:38.528 --> 01:40.826
<i>Astronomers say that</i>
<i>the planet Saturn...</i>

01:41.030 --> 01:44.557
<i>... is an immense globe</i>
<i>of hydrogen and helium...</i>

01:44.768 --> 01:48.169
<i>... encircled by a ring of snowballs...</i>

01:48.371 --> 01:50.999
<i>... 50,000 kilometers wide...</i>

01:51.207 --> 01:55.234
<i>... and that Jupiter's great red spot</i>
<i>is a giant storm raging...</i>

01:55.445 --> 01:57.606
<i>... for perhaps a million years.</i>

01:57.814 --> 02:02.342
<i>But the astrologers see the planets</i>
<i>as affecting human character and fate.</i>

02:02.552 --> 02:06.886
<i>Jupiter represents a regal bearing</i>
<i>and a gentle disposition.</i>

02:07.390 --> 02:10.257
<i>And Saturn, the gravedigger...</i>

02:10.460 --> 02:14.988
<i>... fosters, they say, mistrust,</i>
<i>suspicion, and evil.</i>

02:16.933 --> 02:20.630
<i>To the astronomers, Mars is</i>
<i>a place as real as the Earth...</i>

02:20.837 --> 02:23.704
<i>... a world awaiting exploration.</i>

02:27.710 --> 02:30.042
<i>But the astrologers see</i>
<i>Mars as a warrior...</i>

02:30.246 --> 02:34.182
<i>... the instigator of quarrels,</i>
<i>violence and destruction.</i>

02:40.323 --> 02:43.690
<i>Astronomy and astrology</i>
<i>were not always so distinct.</i>

02:43.893 --> 02:47.920
<i>For most of human history,</i>
<i>the one encompassed the other.</i>

02:48.131 --> 02:49.223
<i>But there came a time...</i>

02:49.432 --> 02:53.129
<i>... when astronomy escaped</i>
<i>from the confines of astrology.</i>

02:55.338 --> 02:57.670
<i>The two traditions began to diverge...</i>

02:57.874 --> 03:00.843
<i>... in the life and mind</i>
<i>of Johannes Kepler.</i>

03:01.044 --> 03:04.377
<i>It was he who demystified</i>
<i>the heavens by discovering...</i>

03:04.581 --> 03:08.108
<i>... that a physical force lay behind</i>
<i>the motions of the planets.</i>

03:08.318 --> 03:13.255
<i>He was the first astrophysicist</i>
<i>and the last scientific astrologer.</i>

03:15.758 --> 03:18.386
<i>The intellectual foundations</i>
<i>of astrology...</i>

03:18.595 --> 03:21.029
<i>... were swept away 300 years ago...</i>

03:21.231 --> 03:26.066
<i>... and yet, astrology is still taken</i>
<i>seriously by a great many people.</i>

03:26.269 --> 03:30.933
<i>Have you ever noticed how easy it is</i>
<i>to find a magazine on astrology?</i>

03:31.140 --> 03:34.871
<i>Virtually every newspaper in America</i>
<i>has a daily column on astrology.</i>

03:35.078 --> 03:39.174
<i>Almost none of them have even</i>
<i>a weekly column on astronomy.</i>

03:39.616 --> 03:41.777
<i>People wear astrological pendants...</i>

03:41.985 --> 03:44.545
<i>... check their horoscopes</i>
<i>in the morning...</i>

03:44.921 --> 03:47.822
<i>... even our language preserves</i>
<i>an astrological aspect.</i>

03:48.324 --> 03:51.555
<i>For example, take the word "disaster".</i>

03:51.761 --> 03:54.389
<i>It comes from the Greek</i>
<i>for "bad star".</i>

03:54.597 --> 03:59.091
<i>Italians once believed disease was</i>
<i>caused by the influence of the stars.</i>

03:59.302 --> 04:02.465
<i>It's the origin</i>
<i>of our word "influenza."</i>

04:04.974 --> 04:07.602
<i>The zodiacal signs used</i>
<i>by astrologers...</i>

04:07.810 --> 04:11.906
<i>... even ornament this statue</i>
<i>of Prometheus in New York City.</i>

04:12.382 --> 04:16.478
<i>Prometheus, who stole fire</i>
<i>from the gods.</i>

04:32.035 --> 04:35.334
What is all this astrology business?

04:35.538 --> 04:37.972
Fundamentally,
it's the contention that...

04:38.174 --> 04:41.666
...the constellations of the planets
at the moment of your birth...

04:41.878 --> 04:44.369
...profoundly influences your future.

04:44.581 --> 04:46.378
A few thousand years ago...

04:46.583 --> 04:49.916
...the idea developed that
the motions of the planets...

04:50.119 --> 04:52.679
...determined the fates of kings...

04:52.889 --> 04:55.517
...dynasties, empires.

04:55.725 --> 04:59.354
Astrologers studied the motions
of the planets and asked...

04:59.562 --> 05:02.156
...what had happened
last time that, say...

05:02.365 --> 05:05.562
...Venus was rising in
the constellation of the Goat?

05:05.768 --> 05:07.998
Maybe something similar
would happen this time.

05:08.204 --> 05:11.298
It was a subtle and risky business.

05:12.742 --> 05:16.769
Astrologers became employed
only by the state.

05:16.980 --> 05:20.143
In many countries
it became a capital offense...

05:20.350 --> 05:24.980
...for anyone but official astrologers
to read the portents in the skies.

05:25.188 --> 05:26.348
Why?

05:26.556 --> 05:30.390
Because a good way to overthrow
a regime was to predict its downfall.

05:30.593 --> 05:34.529
Chinese court astrologers
who made inaccurate predictions...

05:34.731 --> 05:36.062
...were executed.

05:36.265 --> 05:38.495
Others simply doctored the records...

05:38.701 --> 05:42.262
...so that afterwards they were
in perfect conformity with events.

05:42.472 --> 05:45.236
Astrology developed
into a strange discipline:

05:45.441 --> 05:49.901
A mixture of careful observations,
mathematics and record-keeping...

05:50.113 --> 05:53.708
...with fuzzy thinking
and pious fraud.

05:55.818 --> 05:58.446
<i>Nevertheless, astrology survived...</i>

05:58.655 --> 06:00.452
<i>... and flourished. Why?</i>

06:00.690 --> 06:02.385
<i>Because it seems to lend...</i>

06:02.592 --> 06:05.356
<i>... a cosmic significance</i>
<i>to our daily lives.</i>

06:05.561 --> 06:08.621
<i>It pretends to satisfy our longing...</i>

06:08.831 --> 06:11.732
<i>... to feel personally connected</i>
<i>with the universe.</i>

06:11.934 --> 06:15.028
<i>Astrology suggests</i>
<i>a dangerous fatalism.</i>

06:15.772 --> 06:19.674
<i>If our lives are controlled by a set</i>
<i>of traffic signals in the sky...</i>

06:19.876 --> 06:22.868
<i>... why try to change anything?</i>

06:28.751 --> 06:29.979
Here, look at this.

06:30.186 --> 06:33.553
Two different newspapers, published
in the same city on the same day.

06:34.023 --> 06:36.890
Let's see what they do
about astrology.

06:37.093 --> 06:38.617
Suppose you were a Libra...

06:38.828 --> 06:42.594
...that is born between
September 23 and October 22.

06:42.799 --> 06:46.166
According to the astrologer
for the <i>New York Post:</i>

06:46.703 --> 06:48.933
"Compromise will help ease tension."

06:49.138 --> 06:51.572
Well. maybe. It's sort of vague.

06:51.874 --> 06:54.968
According to the
<i>New York Daily News'</i> astrologer:

06:55.545 --> 06:58.571
"Demand more of yourself."
Well, also vague.

06:58.781 --> 07:00.339
But also pretty different.

07:01.050 --> 07:05.043
It's interesting that these
predictions are not predictions.

07:05.254 --> 07:08.417
They tell you what to do,
they don't say what will happen.

07:08.624 --> 07:11.320
They're consciously designed
to be so vague...

07:11.527 --> 07:13.427
...that it could apply to anybody...

07:13.629 --> 07:16.223
...and they disagree with each other.

07:16.966 --> 07:20.732
Astrology can be tested
by the lives of twins.

07:20.937 --> 07:22.700
There are many real cases like this:

07:22.905 --> 07:24.873
One twin is killed in childhood...

07:25.074 --> 07:28.840
...in, say, a riding accident,
or is struck by lightning...

07:29.045 --> 07:32.412
...but the other lives
to a prosperous old age.

07:32.782 --> 07:35.717
Suppose that happened to me.

07:37.420 --> 07:39.513
My twin and I would be born...

07:39.722 --> 07:42.885
...in precisely the same place
and within minutes of each other.

07:43.092 --> 07:46.687
Exactly the same planets would
be rising at our births.

07:46.896 --> 07:48.864
If astrology were valid...

07:49.332 --> 07:53.029
...how could we have such
profoundly different fates?

07:53.436 --> 07:57.532
It turns out that astrologers
can't even agree among themselves...

07:57.740 --> 07:59.469
...what a given horoscope means.

07:59.675 --> 08:02.235
In careful tests
they're unable to predict...

08:02.445 --> 08:06.040
...the character and future of people
they know nothing about...

08:06.249 --> 08:08.274
...except the time and place of birth.

08:08.484 --> 08:10.975
Also, how could it possibly work?

08:11.187 --> 08:15.351
How could the rising of Mars at
the moment of my birth affect me...

08:15.558 --> 08:17.287
...then or now?

08:17.493 --> 08:21.589
I was born in a closed room.
Light from Mars couldn't get in.

08:21.798 --> 08:25.256
The only influence of Mars which
could affect me was its gravity.

08:25.468 --> 08:28.596
But the gravitational influence
of the obstetrician...

08:28.805 --> 08:32.036
...was much larger than
the gravitational influence of Mars.

08:32.241 --> 08:34.072
Mars is a lot more massive...

08:34.277 --> 08:36.837
...but the obstetrician
was a lot closer.

08:45.388 --> 08:48.084
<i>The desire to be connected</i>
<i>with the cosmos...</i>

08:48.291 --> 08:50.384
<i>... reflects a profound reality...</i>

08:50.593 --> 08:52.060
<i>... for we are connected.</i>

08:52.261 --> 08:56.755
<i>Not in the trivial ways that the</i>
<i>pseudo-science of astrology promises...</i>

08:57.233 --> 08:59.167
<i>... but in the deepest ways.</i>

09:04.106 --> 09:08.634
<i>Our little planet is</i>
<i>under the influence of a star.</i>

09:09.011 --> 09:11.946
<i>The sun warms us.</i>
<i>It drives the weather.</i>

09:12.782 --> 09:15.774
<i>It sustains all living things.</i>

09:15.985 --> 09:20.513
<i>Four billion years ago,</i>
<i>it brought forth life on Earth.</i>

09:20.923 --> 09:22.288
<i>But our sun...</i>

09:22.491 --> 09:27.019
<i>... is only one of</i>
<i>a billion trillion stars...</i>

09:27.230 --> 09:29.596
<i>... within the observable universe.</i>

09:30.366 --> 09:34.564
<i>And those countless suns</i>
<i>all obey natural laws...</i>

09:34.770 --> 09:37.830
<i>... some of which are</i>
<i>already known to us.</i>

09:41.244 --> 09:45.146
<i>How did we discover</i>
<i>that there are such laws?</i>

09:46.449 --> 09:50.044
If we lived on a planet
where nothing ever changed...

09:50.253 --> 09:52.050
...there wouldn't be much to do.

09:52.255 --> 09:54.553
There'd be nothing to figure out.

09:54.824 --> 09:57.258
There'd be no impetus for science.

09:57.693 --> 10:00.890
And if we lived in
an unpredictable world...

10:01.097 --> 10:03.759
...where things changed
in random or complex ways...

10:03.966 --> 10:06.958
...we wouldn't be able
to figure things out.

10:07.169 --> 10:09.399
And again, there'd be
no such thing as science.

10:10.139 --> 10:13.131
But we live in
an in-between universe...

10:13.342 --> 10:15.242
...where things change, all right...

10:15.444 --> 10:18.641
...but according to patterns, rules...

10:18.848 --> 10:22.181
...or as we call them,
laws of nature.

10:24.887 --> 10:27.014
If I throw a stick up in the air...

10:27.456 --> 10:29.856
...it always falls down.

10:30.559 --> 10:33.460
If the sun sets in the west...

10:33.663 --> 10:37.861
...it always rises again
the next morning in the east.

10:38.067 --> 10:40.729
And so, it's possible
to figure things out.

10:40.937 --> 10:45.374
We can do science, and with it
we can improve our lives.

10:49.011 --> 10:51.673
Human beings are good
at understanding the world.

10:51.881 --> 10:53.678
We always have been.

10:53.883 --> 10:58.149
We were able to hunt game
or build fires...

10:58.354 --> 11:01.755
...only because we had
figured something out.

11:19.775 --> 11:21.640
There once was a time...

11:21.844 --> 11:23.334
...before television...

11:23.546 --> 11:27.141
...before motion pictures,
before radio, before books.

11:27.583 --> 11:31.383
The greatest part of human existence
was spent in such a time.

11:33.889 --> 11:37.256
And then over the dying embers
of the campfire...

11:37.760 --> 11:39.591
...on a moonless night...

11:40.363 --> 11:42.797
...we watched the stars.

11:47.336 --> 11:51.500
The night sky is interesting.
There are patterns there.

11:51.707 --> 11:54.505
If you look closely,
you can see pictures.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.747
<i>One of the easiest constellations</i>
<i>to recognize...</i>

12:00.950 --> 12:03.510
<i>... lies in the northern skies.</i>

12:03.719 --> 12:07.587
<i>In North America,</i>
<i>it's called the Big Dipper.</i>

12:07.790 --> 12:11.385
<i>The French have a similar idea.</i>
<i>They call it</i> La Casserole.

12:11.594 --> 12:13.255
<i>"The casserole."</i>

12:18.234 --> 12:20.862
<i>In medieval England,</i>
<i>the same pattern of stars...</i>

12:21.070 --> 12:24.699
<i>... reminded people of</i>
<i>a simple wooden plow.</i>

12:31.447 --> 12:34.814
<i>The ancient Chinese had</i>
<i>a more sophisticated notion.</i>

12:35.017 --> 12:37.212
<i>To them these stars carried...</i>

12:37.420 --> 12:41.686
<i>... the celestial bureaucrat on</i>
<i>his rounds about the sky...</i>

12:41.891 --> 12:44.485
<i>... seated on the clouds</i>
<i>and accompanied...</i>

12:44.693 --> 12:47.526
<i>... by his eternally</i>
<i>hopeful petitioners.</i>

12:49.498 --> 12:52.228
<i>The people of northern Europe</i>
<i>imagined another pattern.</i>

12:52.435 --> 12:56.166
<i>To them it was</i>
<i>Charles' Wain, or wagon.</i>

12:56.372 --> 12:58.272
<i>A medieval cart.</i>

12:59.775 --> 13:03.336
<i>But other cultures saw these seven</i>
<i>stars as part of a larger picture.</i>

13:03.546 --> 13:06.174
<i>It was the tail of a great bear...</i>

13:06.382 --> 13:09.044
<i>... which the ancient Greeks</i>
<i>and Native Americans saw...</i>

13:09.251 --> 13:11.242
<i>... instead of the handle of a dipper.</i>

13:11.454 --> 13:15.686
<i>But the most imaginative interpretation</i>
<i>of this larger group of stars...</i>

13:15.891 --> 13:17.654
<i>... was that of the ancient Egyptians.</i>

13:17.860 --> 13:21.762
<i>They made out a curious procession</i>
<i>of a bull and a reclining man...</i>

13:21.964 --> 13:26.264
<i>... followed by a strolling hippopotamus</i>
<i>with a crocodile on its back.</i>

13:26.469 --> 13:30.200
<i>What a marvelous diversity</i>
<i>in the images various cultures saw...</i>

13:30.406 --> 13:32.169
<i>... in this particular constellation.</i>

13:32.374 --> 13:36.105
<i>But the same is true</i>
<i>for all the other constellations.</i>

13:37.446 --> 13:41.576
Some people think these things
are really in the night sky...

13:41.784 --> 13:44.446
...but we put these pictures
there ourselves.

13:44.653 --> 13:46.621
We were hunter folk...

13:46.822 --> 13:48.949
...so we put hunters and dogs...

13:49.158 --> 13:52.093
...lions and young women
up in the skies.

13:52.294 --> 13:56.025
All manner of things
of interest to us.

13:57.433 --> 14:01.426
When 17 th century European sailors
first saw the southern skies...

14:01.670 --> 14:04.764
...they put all sorts of things
of 17 th century interest up there.

14:04.974 --> 14:08.341
Microscopes and telescopes,
compasses...

14:08.544 --> 14:10.671
...and the sterns of ships.

14:11.747 --> 14:15.547
If the constellations had been
named in the 20th century...

14:15.751 --> 14:19.915
...I suppose we'd put there
refrigerators and bicycles...

14:20.122 --> 14:24.354
...rock stars,
maybe even mushroom clouds.

14:24.560 --> 14:28.018
A new set of human hopes and fears...

14:28.230 --> 14:30.721
...placed among the stars.

14:31.800 --> 14:35.292
But there's more to the stars
than just pictures.

14:35.504 --> 14:39.099
For example, stars always
rise in the east...

14:39.308 --> 14:41.208
...and always set in the west...

14:41.410 --> 14:45.870
...taking the whole night to cross
the sky if they pass overhead.

14:46.081 --> 14:49.414
There are different constellations
in different seasons.

14:49.618 --> 14:54.180
The same constellations always rise
at, say, the beginning of autumn.

14:54.390 --> 14:56.654
It never happens that
a new constellation...

14:56.859 --> 15:00.226
...suddenly appears out of the east,
one that you never saw before.

15:00.429 --> 15:03.990
There's a regularity, a permanence...

15:04.200 --> 15:06.725
...a predictability about the stars.

15:06.936 --> 15:10.804
In a way, they're almost comforting.

15:22.785 --> 15:26.346

<i>after a total eclipse...</i>

15:26.655 --> 15:31.319
<i>... its rising in the morning after</i>
<i>its troublesome absence at night...</i>

15:31.527 --> 15:35.554
<i>... and the reappearance of the</i>
<i>crescent moon after the new moon...</i>

15:35.764 --> 15:38.130
<i>... all spoke to our ancestors...</i>

15:38.334 --> 15:41.064
<i>... of the possibility</i>
<i>of surviving death.</i>

15:41.270 --> 15:46.173
<i>Up there in the skies</i>
<i>was a metaphor of immortality.</i>

15:46.909 --> 15:50.310
<i>Almost a thousand years ago</i>
<i>in the American Southwest...</i>

15:50.512 --> 15:52.673
<i>... the Anasazi people</i>
<i>built a stone temple...</i>

15:52.881 --> 15:57.443
<i>... an astronomical observatory</i>
<i>to mark the longest day of the year.</i>

15:57.653 --> 16:01.487
<i>Dawn on that day must</i>
<i>have been a joyous occasion...</i>

16:01.690 --> 16:05.182
<i>... a celebration of</i>
<i>the generosity of the sun.</i>

16:19.842 --> 16:21.901
<i>They built this ceremonial calendar...</i>

16:22.111 --> 16:25.603
<i>... so that the sun's rays</i>
<i>would penetrate a window...</i>

16:25.814 --> 16:28.578
<i>... and enter a particular niche...</i>

16:28.884 --> 16:31.284
<i>... on this day alone.</i>

16:35.758 --> 16:39.489
<i>That kind of precision is</i>
<i>a triumph of human intelligence.</i>

16:39.695 --> 16:41.856
<i>It outlives its creators.</i>

16:42.064 --> 16:46.831
<i>Today, this is a lonely place.</i>
<i>The Anasazi people are no more.</i>

16:47.036 --> 16:49.800
<i>They had learned to predict</i>
<i>the changing of the seasons.</i>

16:50.005 --> 16:52.565
<i>They could not predict</i>
<i>the changing of the climate...</i>

16:52.775 --> 16:54.538
<i>... and the failure of the rains.</i>

16:54.743 --> 16:57.041
<i>But their temple continues to catch...</i>

16:57.246 --> 17:00.238
<i>... the sun's first rays</i>
<i>on the summer solstice.</i>

17:04.820 --> 17:08.085
I imagine the Anasazi people...

17:08.324 --> 17:12.784
...gathered in these pews
every June 21...

17:12.995 --> 17:14.986
...dressed with feathers
and turquoise...

17:15.197 --> 17:17.995
...to celebrate the power of the sun.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.633
These upper niches...

17:20.836 --> 17:23.327
...there are 28 of them...

17:23.539 --> 17:26.633
...may represent the number of days
for the moon to reappear...

17:26.842 --> 17:28.901
...in the same constellation.

17:29.511 --> 17:33.038
These people paid a lot
of attention to the sun...

17:33.248 --> 17:35.182
...and the moon and the stars.

17:35.384 --> 17:38.615
And other devices based
on somewhat similar designs...

17:38.821 --> 17:42.416
...can be found in Angkor Wat
in Cambodia...

17:42.624 --> 17:44.114
...Stonehenge in England...

17:44.326 --> 17:46.521
...Abu Simbel in Egypt...

17:46.729 --> 17:49.061
...Chichén Itzá in Mexico...

17:49.264 --> 17:51.698
...and in the Great Plains
of North America.

17:51.900 --> 17:55.165
Now, why did people
all over the world...

17:55.371 --> 17:59.569
...go to such great trouble
to teach themselves astronomy?

18:03.645 --> 18:06.944
It was literally
a matter of life and death...

18:07.149 --> 18:10.482
...to be able to predict the seasons.

18:11.787 --> 18:14.255
We hunted antelope or buffalo...

18:14.456 --> 18:17.721
...whose migrations
ebbed and flowed...

18:17.926 --> 18:19.450
...with the seasons.

18:19.895 --> 18:23.023
Fruits and nuts were
ready to be picked...

18:23.232 --> 18:25.393
...in some times and not in others.

18:25.601 --> 18:28.729
When we invented agriculture,
we had to take care...

18:28.937 --> 18:33.374
...and sow our seeds and harvest
our crops at just the right season.

18:33.575 --> 18:37.011
Annual meetings of
far-flung nomadic peoples...

18:37.212 --> 18:39.646
...were set for prescribed times.

18:40.416 --> 18:41.644
Now...

18:41.884 --> 18:45.445
Some alleged calendrical devices
might be due to chance.

18:45.654 --> 18:47.121
For example...

18:47.623 --> 18:51.218
<i>... the accidental alignment</i>
<i>of a window and a niche...</i>

18:51.427 --> 18:55.955
<i>... but there are other devices,</i>
<i>wonderfully different.</i>

19:05.307 --> 19:08.868
<i>Today, only the dry ruins</i>
<i>of the great Anasazi cities...</i>

19:09.077 --> 19:12.046
<i>... have survived the ravages of time.</i>

19:14.750 --> 19:19.483
<i>Not far from these ancient cities</i>
<i>in an almost inaccessible location...</i>

19:19.688 --> 19:21.588
<i>... there is another solstice marker.</i>

19:21.790 --> 19:24.884
<i>This one of singular</i>
<i>and unmistakable purpose.</i>

19:25.861 --> 19:28.921
<i>The deliberate arrangement</i>
<i>of three great stone slabs...</i>

19:29.131 --> 19:31.361
<i>... allows a sliver of sunlight...</i>

19:31.567 --> 19:35.025
<i>... to pierce the heart</i>
<i>of a carved spiral...</i>

19:35.237 --> 19:38.536
<i>... only at noon on</i>
<i>the longest day of the year.</i>

19:41.043 --> 19:43.477
(WIND WHISTLES)

19:45.981 --> 19:49.974
The wind whips through the canyons
here in the American Southwest...

19:50.185 --> 19:52.949
...and there's no one
to hear it but us.

19:53.422 --> 19:56.949
A reminder of
the 40,000 generations...

19:57.159 --> 20:00.026

...about whom we know
next to nothing...

20:03.832 --> 20:07.893
...upon whom our society is based.

20:21.817 --> 20:26.220
<i>When our prehistoric ancestors</i>
<i>studied the sky after sunset...</i>

20:26.421 --> 20:29.515
<i>... they observed that some</i>
<i>of the stars were not fixed...</i>

20:29.725 --> 20:33.320
<i>... with respect to the constant</i>
<i>pattern of the constellations.</i>

20:33.529 --> 20:36.726
<i>Instead, five of them moved...</i>

20:36.932 --> 20:39.298
<i>... slowly forward across the sky...</i>

20:39.501 --> 20:43.028
<i>... then backward for a few months,</i>
<i>then forward again...</i>

20:43.238 --> 20:45.468
<i>... as if they couldn't</i>
<i>make up their minds.</i>

20:45.674 --> 20:47.801
<i>We call them planets...</i>

20:48.010 --> 20:50.410
<i>... the Greek word for "wanderers".</i>

20:50.612 --> 20:53.103
<i>These planets presented</i>
<i>a profound mystery.</i>

20:53.315 --> 20:57.376
<i>The earliest explanation was</i>
<i>that they were living beings.</i>

20:57.586 --> 21:01.249
<i>How else explain</i>
<i>their strange, looping behavior?</i>

21:01.456 --> 21:03.754
<i>Later, they were thought to be gods...</i>

21:03.959 --> 21:07.952
<i>... and then disembodied</i>
<i>astrological influences.</i>

21:10.265 --> 21:12.893
<i>But the real solution</i>
<i>to this particular mystery...</i>

21:13.101 --> 21:16.593
<i>... is that planets are worlds,</i>
<i>that the Earth is one of them...</i>

21:16.805 --> 21:20.764
<i>... and that they go around the sun</i>
<i>according to precise mathematical laws.</i>

21:20.976 --> 21:23.536
<i>This discovery has led directly...</i>

21:23.745 --> 21:26.839
<i>... to our modern global civilization.</i>

21:28.417 --> 21:30.783
<i>The merging of imagination</i>
<i>with observation...</i>

21:30.986 --> 21:34.285
<i>... produced an exact description</i>
<i>of the solar system.</i>

21:34.489 --> 21:36.787
<i>Only then could you answer</i>
<i>the fundamental question...</i>

21:36.992 --> 21:38.687
<i>... at the root of modern science:</i>

21:39.461 --> 21:41.622
<i>What makes it all go?</i>

21:42.364 --> 21:45.891
<i>Two thousand years ago, no such</i>
<i>question would have been asked.</i>

21:46.101 --> 21:49.161
<i>The prevailing view had then been</i>
<i>formulated by Claudius Ptolemy...</i>

21:49.404 --> 21:50.928
<i>... an Alexandrian astronomer...</i>

21:51.139 --> 21:54.768
<i>... and also the preeminent</i>
<i>astrologer of his time.</i>

21:57.913 --> 22:01.371
Ptolemy believed that the Earth
was the center of the universe...

22:01.583 --> 22:05.280
...that the sun and the moon
and the planets like Mars...

22:05.487 --> 22:07.318
...went around the Earth.

22:07.522 --> 22:09.353
It's the most natural idea
in the world.

22:09.558 --> 22:13.255
The earth seems steady,
solid, immobile...

22:13.462 --> 22:17.592
...while we can see the heavenly bodies
rising and setting every day.

22:17.799 --> 22:21.132
But then, how explain
the loop-the-loop motion...

22:21.336 --> 22:24.396
...of the planets in the sky?
Mars, for example?

22:24.606 --> 22:27.769
This little machine shows
Ptolemy's model.

22:28.143 --> 22:31.010
The planets were imagined
to go around the Earth...

22:31.213 --> 22:33.408
...attached to
perfect crystal spheres...

22:33.615 --> 22:35.879
...but not attached directly
to the spheres...

22:36.084 --> 22:39.383
...but indirectly through
a kind of off-center wheel.

22:44.159 --> 22:46.684
The sphere turns,
the little wheel rotates...

22:46.895 --> 22:51.025
...and as seen from the Earth,
Mars does its loop-the-loop.

22:59.307 --> 23:02.936
This model permitted
reasonably accurate predictions...

23:03.145 --> 23:05.136
...of planetary motion.

23:05.347 --> 23:08.646
Good enough predictions
for the precision of measurement...

23:08.850 --> 23:11.751
...in Ptolemy's time and much later.

23:13.221 --> 23:16.588
Supported by the church
through the Dark Ages...

23:16.792 --> 23:19.317
...Ptolemy's model
effectively prevented...

23:19.528 --> 23:22.190
...the advance of astronomy
for 1500 years.

23:22.397 --> 23:26.333
Finally, in 1543,
a quite different explanation...

23:26.535 --> 23:28.594
...of the apparent motion
of the planets...

23:28.804 --> 23:33.673
...was published by a Polish cleric
named Nicolaus Copernicus.

23:34.776 --> 23:37.176
Its most daring feature
was the proposition...

23:37.379 --> 23:39.609
...that the sun was
the center of the universe.

23:39.815 --> 23:43.581
The Earth was demoted
to just one of the planets.

23:43.785 --> 23:46.015
The retrograde,
or loop-the-loop motion...

23:46.221 --> 23:49.247
...happens as the Earth
overtakes Mars in its orbit.

23:49.458 --> 23:53.656
You can see that,
from the standpoint of the Earth...

23:53.862 --> 23:56.422
...Mars is now going
slightly backwards...

23:56.631 --> 24:00.431
...and now it is going
in its original direction.

24:00.635 --> 24:03.661
This Copernican model worked
at least as well...

24:03.872 --> 24:06.067
...as Ptolemy's crystal spheres.

24:06.274 --> 24:08.936
But it annoyed an awful lot of people.

24:09.144 --> 24:12.477
The Catholic Church later
put Copernicus' work...

24:12.681 --> 24:15.309
...on its list of forbidden books.

24:15.517 --> 24:19.613
And Martin Luther described
Copernicus in these words:

24:19.821 --> 24:23.518
"People give ear
to an upstart astrologer.

24:23.725 --> 24:27.286
This fool wishes to reverse...

24:27.496 --> 24:29.964
...the entire science of astronomy."

the two views of the cosmos...

24:37.205 --> 24:39.366
...Earth-centered and sun-centered...

24:39.574 --> 24:41.769
...reached its climax with a man...

24:41.977 --> 24:45.811
...who, like Ptolemy, was both
an astronomer and an astrologer.

24:52.254 --> 24:53.551
<i>He lived in a time...</i>

24:53.755 --> 24:56.019
<i>... when the human spirit</i>
<i>was fettered...</i>

24:56.224 --> 24:58.454

<i>... when angels and demons</i>
<i>and crystal spheres...</i>

44:34.668 --> 44:39.162
...and of course,
90 degrees from horizon...

44:39.373 --> 44:40.431
...to zenith.

44:40.641 --> 44:43.542
So a few minutes of arc is
a small quantity to measure...

44:44.111 --> 44:45.908
...especially without a telescope.

44:46.113 --> 44:49.014
But Kepler's ecstasy of discovery...

44:49.216 --> 44:51.650
...soon crumbled into gloom.

44:51.852 --> 44:56.653
Two further observations by Tycho
were inconsistent with his orbit...

44:56.857 --> 44:59.758
...by as much as eight minutes of arc.

45:00.294 --> 45:04.458
Kepler wrote, "If I had believed we
could ignore these eight minutes...

45:04.665 --> 45:07.327
...I would've patched up
my hypothesis accordingly.

45:07.534 --> 45:10.094
Since it was not permissible
to ignore them...

45:10.304 --> 45:13.034
...those eight minutes
pointed the road...

45:13.240 --> 45:16.073
...to a complete reformation
of astronomy."

45:16.410 --> 45:20.847
The difference between a circular orbit
and the true orbit of Mars...

45:21.048 --> 45:25.144
...could be distinguished
only by precise measurement...

45:25.352 --> 45:28.515
...and by a courageous
acceptance of the facts.

45:28.722 --> 45:33.489
Kepler was profoundly annoyed
at having to abandon a circular orbit.

45:33.861 --> 45:37.729
It shook his faith in God...

45:37.931 --> 45:41.833
...as the Maker of
a perfect celestial geometry.

45:42.269 --> 45:44.499
"Having cleaned the stable...

45:44.705 --> 45:47.868
...of astronomy of circles
and spirals," he said...

45:48.075 --> 45:50.066
...he was left...

45:50.277 --> 45:54.407
...with "only a single
cartful of dung."

45:54.615 --> 45:58.517
He tried various oval-like curves,
calculated away...

45:58.719 --> 46:01.119
...made some arithmetical mistakes...

46:01.321 --> 46:04.154
...which caused him
to reject the correct answer.

46:04.358 --> 46:08.488
Months later, in some desperation...

46:08.695 --> 46:12.563
...he tried the formula
for the first time for an ellipse.

46:12.766 --> 46:16.668
The ellipse matched
the observations of Tycho beautifully.

46:18.772 --> 46:21.297
<i>In such an orbit,</i>
<i>the sun isn't at the center.</i>

46:21.508 --> 46:26.411
<i>It is offset.</i>
<i>It's at one focus of the ellipse.</i>

46:26.713 --> 46:30.171
<i>When a given planet is at the far</i>
<i>point in its orbit from the sun...</i>

46:30.384 --> 46:31.715
<i>... it goes more slowly.</i>

46:31.919 --> 46:35.116
<i>As it approaches the near point,</i>
<i>it speeds up.</i>

46:35.322 --> 46:37.847
<i>Such motion is why</i>
<i>we describe the planets...</i>

46:38.058 --> 46:40.959
<i>... as forever falling</i>
<i>towards the sun...</i>

46:41.161 --> 46:42.651
<i>... but never reaching it.</i>

46:42.863 --> 46:46.594
<i>Kepler's first law of</i>
<i>planetary motion is simply this:</i>

46:46.800 --> 46:49.667
<i>A planet moves in an ellipse...</i>

46:49.870 --> 46:52.600
<i>... with the sun at one focus.</i>

46:55.809 --> 46:58.437
<i>As a planet moves along its orbit,</i>
<i>it sweeps out...</i>

46:58.645 --> 47:03.082
<i>... in a given period of time,</i>
<i>an imaginary wedge-shaped area.</i>

47:03.283 --> 47:06.309
<i>When the planet's far from the sun,</i>
<i>the area's long and thin.</i>

47:06.520 --> 47:10.479
<i>When the planet is close to the sun,</i>
<i>the area is short and squat.</i>

47:10.824 --> 47:13.088
<i>Though the shapes of</i>
<i>the wedges are different...</i>

47:13.293 --> 47:17.229
<i>... Kepler found that</i>
<i>their areas are exactly the same.</i>

47:17.831 --> 47:21.961
<i>This provided a precise description</i>
<i>of how a planet changes its speed...</i>

47:22.169 --> 47:24.694
<i>... in relation to its distance</i>
<i>from the sun.</i>

47:24.905 --> 47:26.873
<i>Now, for the first time...</i>

47:27.074 --> 47:29.941
<i>... astronomers could predict</i>
<i>where a planet would be...</i>

47:30.144 --> 47:33.341
<i>... in accordance with</i>
<i>a simple and invariable law.</i>

47:33.547 --> 47:36.107
<i>Kepler's second law is this:</i>

47:36.316 --> 47:40.150
<i>A planet sweeps out equal areas</i>
<i>in equal times.</i>

47:41.288 --> 47:44.086
Kepler's first two
laws of planetary motion...

47:44.291 --> 47:47.783
...may seem a little
remote and abstract.

47:47.995 --> 47:52.762
Planets move in ellipses and they
sweep out equal areas in equal times.

47:52.966 --> 47:54.729
So what?

47:55.135 --> 47:58.298
It's not as easy to grasp
as circular motion.

47:58.505 --> 48:01.201
We might have a tendency
to dismiss it...

48:01.408 --> 48:04.104
...to say it's a mere
mathematical tinkering...

48:04.311 --> 48:08.008
...something removed
from everyday life.

48:08.215 --> 48:12.675
But these are the laws
our planet itself obeys.

48:12.886 --> 48:16.549
As we, glued by gravity
to the surface of the Earth...

48:16.757 --> 48:18.452
...hurtle through space...

48:18.659 --> 48:21.355
...we move in accord
with laws of nature...

48:21.562 --> 48:23.996
...which Kepler first discovered.

48:24.198 --> 48:26.792
When we send spacecraft
to the planets...

48:27.000 --> 48:28.991
...when we observe double stars...

48:29.203 --> 48:32.502
...when we examine the motion
of distant galaxies...

48:32.706 --> 48:37.643
...we find that all over the universe,
Kepler's laws are obeyed.

48:38.345 --> 48:39.607
Many years later...

48:39.813 --> 48:44.250
...Kepler came upon his third
and last law of planetary motion.

48:44.451 --> 48:48.615
A law which relates the motion of
the various planets to each other...

48:48.822 --> 48:50.653
...which lays out correctly...

48:50.857 --> 48:53.985
<i>... the clockwork of the solar system.</i>

48:56.096 --> 48:58.326
<i>He discovered</i>
<i>a mathematical relationship...</i>

48:58.532 --> 49:00.591
<i>... between the size</i>
<i>of a planet's orbit...</i>

49:00.801 --> 49:03.793
<i>... and the average speed at</i>
<i>which it travels around the sun.</i>

49:04.004 --> 49:06.199
<i>This confirmed his long-held belief...</i>

49:06.406 --> 49:09.933
<i>... that there must be a force in</i>
<i>the sun that drives the planets.</i>

49:10.143 --> 49:13.112
<i>A force stronger for</i>
<i>the inner, fast-moving planets...</i>

49:13.313 --> 49:16.373
<i>... and weaker for</i>
<i>the outer, slow-moving planets.</i>

49:16.583 --> 49:20.679
<i>Isaac Newton later identified</i>
<i>that force as gravity.</i>

49:20.887 --> 49:23.685
<i>Answering at last</i>
<i>the fundamental question:</i>

49:23.890 --> 49:26.290
<i>What makes the planets go?</i>

49:27.761 --> 49:29.922
<i>Kepler's third or Harmonic Law...</i>

49:30.130 --> 49:33.657
<i>... states that the squares</i>
<i>of the periods of the planets...</i>

49:33.867 --> 49:36.358
<i>... the time for them</i>
<i>to make one orbit...</i>

49:36.570 --> 49:39.471
...are proportional to the cubes,
the third power...

49:39.673 --> 49:42.642
...of their average distances
from the sun.

49:42.843 --> 49:46.973
So the further away a planet is
from the sun, the slower it moves...

49:47.180 --> 49:50.741
...but according to
a precise mathematical law.

49:50.951 --> 49:54.717
Kepler was the first person in
the history of the human species...

49:54.921 --> 49:58.220
...to understand correctly
and quantitatively...

49:58.425 --> 50:00.052
...how the planets move...

50:00.260 --> 50:02.820
...how the solar system works.

50:14.975 --> 50:18.206
<i>The man who sought harmony</i>
<i>in the cosmos...</i>

50:18.412 --> 50:23.349
<i>... was fated to live at a time</i>
<i>of exceptional discord on Earth.</i>

50:23.617 --> 50:27.610
<i>Exactly eight days after</i>
<i>Kepler's discovery of his third law...</i>

50:27.821 --> 50:29.948
<i>... there occurred in Prague</i>
<i>an incident...</i>

50:30.157 --> 50:33.786
<i>... that unleashed</i>
<i>the devastating Thirty Years' War.</i>

50:33.994 --> 50:38.454
<i>The war's convulsions shattered</i>
<i>the lives of millions of people.</i>

50:40.067 --> 50:44.970
<i>Kepler lost his wife and young son</i>
<i>to an epidemic spread by the soldiery.</i>

50:45.339 --> 50:47.864
<i>His royal patron was deposed...</i>

50:48.075 --> 50:50.873
<i>... and he was excommunicated</i>
<i>from the Lutheran church...</i>

50:51.078 --> 50:55.208
<i>... for his uncompromising independence</i>
<i>on questions of belief.</i>

50:55.415 --> 50:57.610
<i>He was a refugee once again.</i>

50:59.019 --> 51:00.213
<i>The conflict...</i>

51:00.420 --> 51:04.322
<i>... portrayed on both sides</i>
<i>as a "holy war"...</i>

51:04.524 --> 51:07.652
<i>... was more an exploitation</i>
<i>of religious bigotry...</i>

51:07.861 --> 51:10.261
<i>... by those hungry for land and power.</i>

51:18.972 --> 51:22.135
<i>This war introduced</i>
<i>organized pillage...</i>

51:22.342 --> 51:25.004
<i>... to keep armies in the field.</i>

51:27.881 --> 51:31.214
<i>The brutalized population of Europe</i>
<i>stood by helpless...</i>

51:31.418 --> 51:33.943
<i>... as their plowshares</i>
<i>and pruning hooks...</i>

51:34.154 --> 51:38.682
<i>... were literally beaten</i>
<i>into swords and spears.</i>

51:38.892 --> 51:42.453
<i>Rumor and paranoia swept</i>
<i>through the countryside...</i>

51:42.662 --> 51:45.790
<i>... enveloping especially</i>
<i>the powerless.</i>

51:46.466 --> 51:48.627
<i>Among the many scapegoats chosen...</i>

51:48.835 --> 51:53.169
<i>... were elderly women living alone,</i>
<i>who were charged with witchcraft.</i>

51:53.373 --> 51:54.965
(THUNDER)

51:57.644 --> 51:59.612
(HORSE WHINNIES)

52:02.749 --> 52:03.613
(WOMAN CRIES)

52:03.817 --> 52:06.809
<i>Kepler's mother was taken away</i>
<i>in the middle of the night...</i>

52:07.454 --> 52:09.581
<i>... in a laundry chest.</i>

52:11.792 --> 52:15.853
<i>It took Kepler six years</i>
<i>of unremitting effort...</i>

52:16.062 --> 52:17.859
<i>... to save her life.</i>

52:20.434 --> 52:25.098
In Kepler's little hometown,
about three women were arrested...

52:25.305 --> 52:29.173
...tortured and killed
as witches every year...

52:29.376 --> 52:33.107
...between 1615 and 1629.

52:33.313 --> 52:37.044
And Katarina Kepler was
a cantankerous old woman.

52:37.250 --> 52:40.947
She engaged in disputes
which annoyed the local nobility...

52:41.154 --> 52:42.587
...and she sold drugs.

52:43.256 --> 52:46.885
Poor Kepler thought that
he himself had contributed...

52:47.093 --> 52:50.654
...inadvertently,
to his mother's arrest.

52:50.864 --> 52:53.196
It came about
because he had written...

52:53.400 --> 52:55.493
...one of the first works
of science fiction.

52:55.702 --> 52:59.138
It was intended to explain
and popularize science...

52:59.339 --> 53:02.240
...and was called <i>The Somnium.</i>

53:02.442 --> 53:03.704
"The Dream."

53:13.854 --> 53:16.687
He imagined a journey to the moon...

53:16.890 --> 53:19.916
...with the space travelers
standing on the lunar surface...

53:20.126 --> 53:24.688
...looking up to see,
rotating slowly above them...

53:24.898 --> 53:27.628
...the lovely planet Earth.

53:29.603 --> 53:32.629
<i>Part of the basis for the charge</i>
<i>of witchcraft was that...</i>

53:32.839 --> 53:37.572
<i>... in his dream, Kepler used his</i>
<i>mother's spells to leave the Earth.</i>

53:37.777 --> 53:39.904
<i>But he really believed that one day...</i>

53:40.113 --> 53:43.446
<i>... human beings would launch</i>
<i>celestial ships...</i>

53:43.650 --> 53:47.051
<i>... with sails adapted</i>
<i>to the breezes of heaven...</i>

53:47.254 --> 53:49.916
<i>... filled with explorers who,</i>
<i>he said...</i>

53:50.123 --> 53:53.251
<i>..."would not fear</i>
<i>the vastness of space."</i>

53:53.894 --> 53:58.092
<i>He speculated on the mountains,</i>
<i>valleys, craters...</i>

53:58.298 --> 54:02.359
<i>... climate and possible</i>
<i>inhabitants of the moon.</i>

54:03.803 --> 54:04.963
<i>Before Kepler...</i>

54:05.171 --> 54:09.005
<i>... astronomy had little connection</i>
<i>with physical reality.</i>

54:09.876 --> 54:12.276
<i>But with Kepler came the idea that...</i>

54:12.479 --> 54:17.007
<i>... a physical force moves</i>
<i>the planets in their orbits.</i>

54:18.118 --> 54:21.679
<i>He was the first</i>
<i>to combine a bold imagination...</i>

54:21.888 --> 54:23.651
<i>... with precise measurements...</i>

54:23.857 --> 54:27.190
<i>... to step out into the cosmos.</i>

54:27.527 --> 54:30.155
<i>It changed everything.</i>

54:56.156 --> 54:59.250
<i>This fusion of facts with dreams...</i>

54:59.459 --> 55:02.189
<i>... opened the way to the stars.</i>

55:06.800 --> 55:07.994
<i>As a boy...</i>

55:08.201 --> 55:12.797
<i>... Kepler had been captured</i>
<i>by a vision of cosmic splendor...</i>

55:13.006 --> 55:14.803
<i>... a harmony of the worlds...</i>

55:15.008 --> 55:17.977
<i>... which he sought so tirelessly</i>
<i>all his life.</i>

55:18.178 --> 55:21.375
<i>Harmony in this world eluded him.</i>

55:21.581 --> 55:24.049
<i>His three laws of</i>
<i>planetary motion represent...</i>

55:24.250 --> 55:25.239
<i>... we now know...</i>

55:25.452 --> 55:28.012
<i>... a real harmony of the worlds.</i>

55:28.221 --> 55:31.850
<i>But to Kepler, they were</i>
<i>only incidental to his quest...</i>

55:32.058 --> 55:35.585
<i>... for a cosmic system</i>
<i>based on the perfect solids.</i>

55:35.795 --> 55:40.027
<i>A system which, it turns out,</i>
<i>existed only in his mind.</i>

55:40.233 --> 55:42.497
<i>Yet, from his work...</i>

55:42.702 --> 55:46.502
<i>... we have found that scientific laws</i>
<i>pervade all of nature...</i>

55:46.706 --> 55:50.369
<i>... that the same rules apply</i>
<i>on Earth as in the skies...</i>

55:50.577 --> 55:54.172
<i>... that we can find</i>
<i>a resonance, a harmony...</i>

55:54.381 --> 55:58.477
<i>... between the way we think</i>
<i>and the way the world works.</i>

56:01.454 --> 56:04.685
<i>When he found that his long-cherished</i>
<i>beliefs did not agree...</i>

56:04.891 --> 56:07.018
<i>... with the most</i>
<i>precise observations...</i>

56:07.227 --> 56:09.923
<i>... he accepted</i>
<i>the uncomfortable facts.</i>

56:10.130 --> 56:13.065
<i>He preferred the hard truth...</i>

56:13.266 --> 56:15.860
<i>... to his dearest illusions.</i>

56:16.069 --> 56:19.095
<i>That is the heart of science.</i>
