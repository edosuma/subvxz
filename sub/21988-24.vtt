Suspect went nuts

Screaming and punching.

leave, three were granted.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.292

would keep the Ulyssesin port.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.776
That's why we're

No, you.

08:39.823 --> 08:42.522
What, Bishop?

08:42.565 --> 08:46.003
Um, we were just wondering.

08:46.047 --> 08:48.049
You weren't a-around all day.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.095
Okay.

of them would be that stupid.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.081

09:20.124 --> 09:23.519
Yeah, not to make excuses,

09:23.563 --> 09:26.522

09:54.376 --> 09:56.596
Really?Yeah. He was tough,

09:56.639 --> 09:58.293
but I learned a lot.

09:58.336 --> 10:00.338
Like, I'm pretty sure he
would've keel-hauled anybody

10:00.382 --> 10:01.862
who'd mess with his mission.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.560
Oh, make that "damn sure."

10:04.604 --> 10:06.954
Thank you, Commander.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.522
Ah, I think it's time
for another toast.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.307
What are we
toasting this time?

10:12.350 --> 10:13.917
Um...

10:13.961 --> 10:15.571
New friends.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.529
That was the last toast.

10:17.573 --> 10:21.621
Maybe it's time
to notch things up?

10:21.664 --> 10:25.320
I could take it up a notch.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.498
Spoiled by the bell.

10:29.541 --> 10:33.328
You mean "saved
by the bell."

10:33.371 --> 10:34.982
The hell with it.

10:35.025 --> 10:36.200
It's just work.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.376
And you're not gonna answer it?

10:38.420 --> 10:39.987
Did you want me to?

10:40.030 --> 10:42.685
You know, if it's work,
I get it.

10:42.729 --> 10:47.211
Well, uh, to be honest,
uh, it wasn't work.

10:47.255 --> 10:50.519
Oh. Let me guess:
a bailout call.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.042
You know about those?

10:52.086 --> 10:55.524
Yes, I just heard about this
from my young pal today.

10:55.567 --> 10:56.873
She's gonna call me
any minute.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.919
Oh, well,
what a relief.

10:58.962 --> 11:01.835
Well, just a minute.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.445
It might be
a work emergency,

11:03.488 --> 11:05.273
and I might have to
pick it up,

11:05.316 --> 11:07.231
and our date would
be cut short...
Well,

11:07.275 --> 11:10.887
before that happens,
how about we skip this joint?

11:12.323 --> 11:14.325
You get that,
and I'll get our coats.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.762
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.332
Hello, Ellie.

11:21.376 --> 11:23.813
This is your 10:00
bailout calling.

11:23.857 --> 11:27.077
Yes, it is, but I won't be
needing it, thank you very much.

11:27.121 --> 11:30.515
Well, that's great.
Love at first sight?

11:30.559 --> 11:33.257
Mm, more like
"lust at second cocktail."

11:34.476 --> 11:37.261
He's cute and funny.

11:37.305 --> 11:40.264
Well, cute and funny are both
very good things.

11:40.308 --> 11:42.179
When you have
a moment, bartender.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.096
Jack?

11:46.140 --> 11:48.229
I'll call you back.

11:50.622 --> 11:53.103
Uh, gin and tonic,
if you please.

11:53.147 --> 11:55.671
And may I see
a bar menu as well?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.064
Thank you.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.291
Do I know you?

12:11.034 --> 12:12.993
Masahun.

12:14.429 --> 12:17.388
You son of a bitch!Stop.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.434
MAITRE D':
Ma'am, please, stop!Son of a bitch!

12:19.477 --> 12:21.828
Stop. What are you doing?Get off me!

12:21.871 --> 12:24.221
Get off...

12:24.265 --> 12:26.702
No, don't let him get away!
Don't!

12:26.746 --> 12:28.617
Get off of me!Calm down!

12:28.660 --> 12:30.314
No!
Ma'am, please.

12:30.358 --> 12:32.316
No.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.021
There we go.

12:41.064 --> 12:44.328
Oh...

12:44.372 --> 12:46.200
It was him, Leon.

12:46.243 --> 12:47.288
:
It was him.

12:47.331 --> 12:48.724
Who's "him," Jack?

12:48.768 --> 12:49.899
Just tell me who.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.466
Masahun.

12:51.509 --> 12:53.468
Wait, Masahun?

12:53.511 --> 12:54.861
The monster.

12:54.904 --> 12:58.255
Afghanistan, the Wingos.

13:04.871 --> 13:08.135
He was there,
and I let him get away.

13:08.178 --> 13:09.745
We have to find him.

13:09.789 --> 13:13.227
But no one ever saw his face.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.271
You always said...

13:14.315 --> 13:15.838
I know, but it was
his voice, Leon.

13:15.882 --> 13:18.014
I will never forget
his voice.

13:18.058 --> 13:21.148
That-that soft, sleek
English thing.

13:21.191 --> 13:22.714
But Masahun is dead.

13:22.758 --> 13:25.674
You know that.
No, no, no.
Not anymore.

13:25.717 --> 13:29.112
He was killed in a drone strike
several years ago.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.548
You saw the same video.

13:30.592 --> 13:32.942
The explosion, the charred body.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.901
Leon, the only reason
I was able to sleep

13:34.944 --> 13:37.120
the last few years is
thinking he was dead.

13:37.164 --> 13:39.296
After tonight, I will
never be able to sleep.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.342
We need to stop him.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.735
Okay, we will stop him.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.216
But I have to ask you
one thing.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.784
How much have you had
to drink tonight?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.742
You don't b-believe me, or...

13:50.786 --> 13:52.309
I want to believe you,
Jack, I do.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.616
But I also want to
get you released

13:54.659 --> 13:56.270
into my custody
from the cops.

13:56.313 --> 13:57.314
And-and to do that...

13:57.358 --> 14:00.665
I had three.
Three drinks.

14:00.709 --> 14:03.625
Can we find him now?

14:03.668 --> 14:05.279
Yes.

14:05.322 --> 14:06.976
We'll get him
first thing tomorrow.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.891
No, no, not tomorrow.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.067
I'm not asking.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.243
Tomorrow we start
with clearer heads,

14:13.287 --> 14:14.810
and we will get him.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.987
Understood?

14:24.689 --> 14:27.083
Sergeant, may I have a word?

14:30.434 --> 14:32.219
BISHOP:
Two sailors.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.221
One male, one female,

14:34.264 --> 14:35.657
both denied
emergency leave.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.180
Had to be the guy.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.008
Women don't make
bomb threats.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.532
Yet another sexist
generalization

14:41.576 --> 14:43.447
before my first
cup of tea.

14:43.491 --> 14:46.407
There he is, the matchmaker.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.889
How'd it go with Sloane
and your friend?

14:49.932 --> 14:51.891
And good morning to you, too,
Gossip Girl.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.501
And I have no idea.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.068
Well, I do.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.461
I called Sloane around 10:00,
and she sounded super happy.

14:57.505 --> 14:59.246
Ah, lucky guy.

15:00.421 --> 15:01.465
What? She's cool as hell.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.119
Wait, did Sloane actually say

15:03.163 --> 15:04.642
"super happy"?

15:04.686 --> 15:08.516
In so many words, McGee,
"having a blast."

15:08.559 --> 15:10.561
Why? Do you know
something different?

15:10.605 --> 15:12.563
I really didn't want
to do this.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.000
TORRES: Well, it's too late,
you did it.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.610
Spill it.

15:17.351 --> 15:20.180
Well, Delilah called Ray
this morning to check in,

15:20.223 --> 15:21.398
and apparently it went badly.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.966
He said Sloane got weird.Ooh, how weird?

15:24.010 --> 15:25.925
McGEE: He didn't give
full details, but...

15:25.968 --> 15:27.361
apparently it was weird enough

15:27.404 --> 15:29.798
that he's already boarding
a plane back to Chicago.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.626
What? That's crazy.

15:31.669 --> 15:32.932
Or she is.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.455
You just said she
was super cool.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.979
Yeah, but cool could
be crazy sometimes.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.155
What could have happened?GIBBS: I don't know.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.983
I don't care.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.593
The interviews.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.117
McGEE:
They just cleared the gate.McGee.

15:45.596 --> 15:47.163
I'm gonna need you.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.253
I'll catch you later, McGee.

15:55.911 --> 15:58.870
There's a restaurant, McGee.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.655
Dasher's Grill.
You know it?

16:00.698 --> 16:02.483
Uh, yeah, I've heard of it.

16:02.526 --> 16:04.702
I need you to dig up
whatever security video

16:04.746 --> 16:07.531
you can find from last night,
around 10:00,

16:07.575 --> 16:09.359
inside and out.
Easy enough.

16:09.403 --> 16:12.319
Also, their credit card
receipts from last night.

16:12.362 --> 16:15.017
Run the names against
our terrorist database.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.889
Um, okay. What exactly
am I looking for?

16:17.933 --> 16:19.456
You'll know when
you see him.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.676
And get the video to Kasie
for facial recognition.

16:21.719 --> 16:25.245
And don't either one of you
discuss this with anybody else.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.551
Leon...

16:27.595 --> 16:29.336
Oh, hey, McGee.
Hi.

16:29.379 --> 16:30.728
You heard from Ray?

16:30.772 --> 16:32.643
Who? Oh, Ray.

16:32.687 --> 16:34.384
Uh, no, no, not me.

16:34.428 --> 16:35.995
Delilah, maybe.
I don't know.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.344
Although, you know,
Ray's not really

16:37.387 --> 16:38.867
the kind of guy
to kiss and tell.

16:38.910 --> 16:42.436
Not to say that you guys
were kissing or anything.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.438
Um...

16:44.481 --> 16:46.440
I'm gonna get right
on that, Director.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.053
Yep, he knows.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.055
Well, at least he was
nice enough to lie.

16:53.099 --> 16:55.449
So, what's
our first move?

16:55.492 --> 16:58.017
Just made it-- McGee's gonna
be gathering intel.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.583
Any word from the cops?
They said they were

16:59.627 --> 17:01.237
gonna look for this guy.They did.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.457
Frankly, I think
they're less interested

17:03.500 --> 17:05.589
in the man who
fled the scene last night

17:05.633 --> 17:06.895
than the woman
who attacked him.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.682
Be patient, Jack.

17:15.730 --> 17:16.818
I can't talk right now,

17:16.861 --> 17:18.254
but if you hear
anything more, text me.

17:18.298 --> 17:19.299
Okay, bye.

17:19.342 --> 17:21.518
Who was that?Uh, Delilah.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.433
Sloane's date with her friend
from Chicago last night

17:23.477 --> 17:25.261
went way worse
than McGee's letting on.

17:25.305 --> 17:26.654
We all have bad dates.

17:26.697 --> 17:28.699
No, not like this.
Sloane was arrested.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.701
What?!That's what Delilah said.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.492
Let's do this.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.494
Oh.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.153
Hey, Duck.
What are you doing here?

17:47.196 --> 17:51.592
Director Vance asked me
to stand in for Agent Sloane.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.202
Why

17:53.246 --> 17:56.118
BISHOP:
All right, Felix.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.338
Uh, it says here
you requested emergency leave

17:58.381 --> 17:59.687
for a personal reason.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.776
I did.

18:01.819 --> 18:04.039
You were asked to be
a little more specific,

18:04.083 --> 18:06.302
but you didn't respond.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.043
Yeah, 'cause it's
still personal.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.001
You know what is
not personal, Felix?

18:10.045 --> 18:11.525
A bomb threat on a ship.

18:11.568 --> 18:12.787
Look, I had nothing
to do with that.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.180
Come on, kid.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.138
You didn't want
to ship out.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.531
You wanted to
stay behind.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.446
Why?

18:21.448 --> 18:25.060
My fiancée was gonna
fly from Omaha

18:25.104 --> 18:26.714
to be with me
before we shipped out.

18:26.757 --> 18:29.412
Then she called

18:29.456 --> 18:33.764
last week,
said she wasn't coming.

18:33.808 --> 18:37.986
I found out that
she hooked up with Joey,

18:38.029 --> 18:41.642
my supposed best friend.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.600
I was desperate to win her back.

18:43.644 --> 18:46.734
So you put in
for emergency leave.Yeah.

18:46.777 --> 18:50.564
My request getting denied
was probably a blessing.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.609
I mean, if I had stayed,
I would have gone back to Omaha

18:52.653 --> 18:54.916
and beaten the crap out of Joey.

18:54.959 --> 18:57.136
Maybe even killed him.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.747
TORRES: You were okay
with getting turned down?

18:59.790 --> 19:02.532
Technically,
I wasn't turned down.

19:02.576 --> 19:06.188
Well, I'm confused.
You were on the ship.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.930
I put in the request
because...

19:08.973 --> 19:11.759
my mom has ovarian cancer.

19:11.802 --> 19:14.327
I wanted to stay behind
to be with her.

19:14.370 --> 19:18.287
Without telling me,
she called my department head.

19:18.331 --> 19:21.508
Told him that I wanted
to be in the Navy

19:21.551 --> 19:23.597
since I was a little girl.

19:23.640 --> 19:27.601
And that my first
overseas assignment...

19:27.644 --> 19:30.169
meant everything to me.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.912
She begged him
not to let her cancer

19:34.956 --> 19:39.787
interfere...
with my lifelong dream.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.832
How's your mom now?

19:41.876 --> 19:46.141
She promised she'd keep fighting
as long as I was away.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.796
And she's never let me down.

19:48.839 --> 19:53.801
Just kids,
with real-life issues.

19:53.844 --> 19:56.586
It's not either of them.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.762
Uh-uh.

20:00.808 --> 20:01.765
GIBBS:
What do we got?

20:01.809 --> 20:04.203
Oh, uh, Gibbs.

20:05.378 --> 20:06.857
Give us any leads?

20:06.901 --> 20:08.816
Oh, actually, um, yes.

20:08.859 --> 20:10.383
Uh, I was able to pull

20:10.426 --> 20:11.819
a partial print
off the mirror

20:11.862 --> 20:13.037
from the second "B" in "bomb."

20:13.081 --> 20:14.517
That give us an I.D.?

20:14.561 --> 20:17.520
Uh, well, no. But, again,
it's only a partial.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.783
So I'm running it
for touch DNA

20:19.827 --> 20:21.045
to see if we get
a match there.

20:21.089 --> 20:23.178
What was that?

20:23.222 --> 20:26.355
That's a TV.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.142
What about that?

20:31.186 --> 20:35.886
That's a, that's... nothing.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.803
Well, that sure looks
like something.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.109
It's not.

20:41.152 --> 20:43.720
Or, it's nothing that
I can tell you about.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.331
Or anyone,
except for McGee.

20:45.374 --> 20:46.854
But he already knows.

20:54.731 --> 20:56.255
I suppose that's
a nobody?

20:56.298 --> 20:57.865
Oh, please, don't tell
Director Vance you saw that.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.736
Well, you need to
tell him you saw it.

20:59.780 --> 21:01.695
I'm usually so good...Kasie,

21:01.738 --> 21:03.958
you need to
tell him now.

21:16.362 --> 21:19.321
SLOANE :
No, please.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.715
No, please.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.719
Sloane, it's okay.No, no.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.286
It's okay.Please.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.599
You okay?

21:36.643 --> 21:38.949
Ah, living the dream.

21:40.124 --> 21:42.475
You got something?I got good news and bad.

21:42.518 --> 21:44.564
You found him.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.261
You tell me.

21:48.219 --> 21:49.612
That's him.

21:49.656 --> 21:52.485
I need to hear
his voice again.

21:52.528 --> 21:55.009
I'm not sure we're
gonna get that chance.

21:55.052 --> 21:57.011
What are you talking about?

21:57.054 --> 22:00.231
The bad news.
His name is Nigel Hakim.

22:00.275 --> 22:02.930
He was born in Saudi Arabia,
raised in the U.K.,

22:02.973 --> 22:05.193
and is working as a guest
out of their embassy.

22:05.236 --> 22:07.891
A guest? Who would
have him as a guest?

22:07.935 --> 22:10.807
Don't they know who he is?They seem to
know him well,

22:10.851 --> 22:13.897
as a humanitarian
who raises millions every year

22:13.941 --> 22:16.335
to help Afghan refugees,
women and children.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.988
Wh-What, am I losing
my mind or something?

22:18.032 --> 22:19.816
Jack, I think it's
time we call it a...

22:19.860 --> 22:21.992
I have to meet him.
We have to confront him.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.690
I need to know.

22:23.733 --> 22:26.910
Hakim is under the umbrella
of diplomatic immunity.

22:28.259 --> 22:30.218
So we can't touch him?

22:30.261 --> 22:31.785
Well, it's a little
too late for that.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.048
You already did, and they're
none too happy about it.

22:34.091 --> 22:37.443
Please.

22:37.486 --> 22:41.534
Leon, I need to hear
his voice again

22:41.577 --> 22:43.927
just to be sure.

22:45.755 --> 22:48.323
If I can arrange that,

22:48.367 --> 22:52.196
we have to tread very lightly.

22:52.240 --> 22:55.330
I can do that.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.028
You know I can.

23:09.475 --> 23:10.650
He's in your office?

23:10.693 --> 23:13.522
Along with
the British deputy ambassador.

23:13.566 --> 23:16.525
Of course.
He wouldn't dare come alone.

23:16.569 --> 23:19.310
Jack, maybe this
isn't a good idea.

23:19.354 --> 23:20.964
No, no, please.

23:21.008 --> 23:25.142
I promise you, Leon,
I have had time to cool down.

23:25.186 --> 23:27.928
All appearances to the contrary.I'm just anxious.

23:27.971 --> 23:31.671
It all happened so fast
last night. I...

23:31.714 --> 23:33.281
Maybe I was mistaken.

23:33.324 --> 23:37.851
I was drinking, after all.
What if I'm wrong?

23:37.894 --> 23:39.548
He'll be expecting an apology.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.768
Then I'll give him one.

23:41.811 --> 23:44.814
:
Okay.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.093
Sorry to keep you waiting.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.704
Deputy Ambassador
Sybil Rigg...

24:06.053 --> 24:07.663
...this is Special Agent
Jacqueline Sloane.

24:07.707 --> 24:09.186
Mr. Hakim...

24:09.230 --> 24:11.275
Nigel, please.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.495
VANCE: I believe
you two have met.

24:13.539 --> 24:16.890
Certainly one way of putting it.

24:18.935 --> 24:21.242
Why did you run?

24:22.504 --> 24:24.288
Let's all have a seat, shall we?

24:24.332 --> 24:25.855
Please.

24:31.687 --> 24:34.777
My reason for running was
obvious, Agent Sloane.

24:34.821 --> 24:37.301
To the rest of the world,
you Americans have earned

24:37.345 --> 24:40.304
a most unfortunate reputation
for shooting one another.

24:40.348 --> 24:43.569
Yet you didn't
mention the incident

24:43.612 --> 24:45.222
to the police.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.529
I have found, Director,

24:47.573 --> 24:50.401
that my fundraising efforts
to care for refugee children

24:50.445 --> 24:52.621
is best carried out
with a low profile.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.536
So being mixed up
in a bar brawl

24:54.580 --> 24:56.799
could literally cost
young lives.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.979
According to your file, you...

25:03.023 --> 25:06.026
you've been working
in Afghanistan since 2007.

25:06.069 --> 25:08.245
I was just starting
my humanitarian mission

25:08.289 --> 25:09.769
at that time, yes.

25:09.812 --> 25:12.641
The exact same time
that my friends and I

25:12.685 --> 25:16.210
were being tortured there
by a man we called Masahun.

25:16.253 --> 25:18.255
And you lived to tell the tale.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.868
My sympathies.

25:21.911 --> 25:24.479
Everyone knew the name,
but didn't I also hear

25:24.523 --> 25:26.829
he'd been killed
in a drone strike?

25:26.873 --> 25:28.570
Allegedly.

25:28.614 --> 25:29.963
Hold on, now.

25:30.006 --> 25:32.748
Are you attempting
to justify your attack

25:32.792 --> 25:34.924
by implying that Mr. Hakim

25:34.968 --> 25:37.840
somehow reminds you
of your captor?

25:37.884 --> 25:39.320
VANCE:
Ambassador,

25:39.363 --> 25:42.018
I personally led
the rescue mission that found

25:42.062 --> 25:45.239
then Lieutenant Sloane
with her Army team.

25:45.282 --> 25:48.634
And the damage done by him
and his men was devastating,

25:48.677 --> 25:50.592
both physically
and psychologically.

25:50.636 --> 25:54.248
I was screwed up.
Uh, and after hearing

25:54.291 --> 25:56.119
Masahun's voice
last night,

25:56.163 --> 25:58.121
I was screwed up
all over again.

25:58.165 --> 26:00.384
Y

26:00.428 --> 26:02.735
Okay, just say one word
for me, will you?

26:02.778 --> 26:04.301
Really, is this necessary?

26:04.345 --> 26:05.651
"Infidels."

26:05.694 --> 26:07.478
That's what
you called us.

26:07.522 --> 26:09.959
Say it. Infidels.

26:10.003 --> 26:14.485
I am sensitive to your ordeal,
Agent Sloane,

26:14.529 --> 26:16.487
but to indulge this delusion
would be...

26:16.531 --> 26:18.751
Just say it!All right.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.187
Okay, that's enough.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.581
Yes, I think
we're quite done here.

26:22.624 --> 26:25.496
No! Wait, wait, wait.I'm sorry. I-I apologize.

26:25.540 --> 26:26.846
I'm really sorry if we...No, no, no, I'm sorry.

26:26.889 --> 26:29.196
Leon. Please, excuse me.
I'm so sorry, okay?

26:29.239 --> 26:30.937
I don't know
what I was thinking.

26:30.980 --> 26:34.810
I was... It's indefensible
what I did last night.

26:34.854 --> 26:36.856
I was completely delusional.

26:36.899 --> 26:39.249
I'm really sorry.

26:39.293 --> 26:41.861
Please... please forgive me.

26:44.559 --> 26:46.822
Please.

26:51.740 --> 26:52.785
Let go of him.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.656
HAKIM:
It's all right.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.616
It's all right. All is forgiven.

26:57.659 --> 27:01.968
I sincerely hope you
get the help you need.

27:02.011 --> 27:04.492
Honestly.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.537
Thank you, Nigel.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.063
Are you out of
your damn mind?!

27:10.106 --> 27:13.283
It's him, Leon. I know it now.

27:13.327 --> 27:14.937
His cologne,

27:14.981 --> 27:17.723
that glint in his eye, like when
I heard his voice last night--

27:17.766 --> 27:19.681
it all came back to me.

27:19.725 --> 27:22.292
All right, then you are gonna
have to let it go, Jack.

27:22.336 --> 27:24.860
I have never been so sure
about anything in my life, Leon.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.209
You are not helping
yourself, Jack.

27:26.253 --> 27:28.211
Do you-- Are you
not seeing that?!

27:28.255 --> 27:29.996
I am ordering you to stay away.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.301
Or what?

27:31.345 --> 27:33.216
Or you will be fired!

27:33.260 --> 27:36.132
You are not okay.
Take some time.

27:36.176 --> 27:38.657
Pull yourself together.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.664
Kasie, what is
the matter?

27:45.707 --> 27:47.361
:
I'm in trouble with Gibbs.

27:47.404 --> 27:49.929
What did you do?It's what I didn't do.

27:49.972 --> 27:51.713
What didn't you do?

27:51.757 --> 27:53.802
He asked me
what I was working on,

27:53.846 --> 27:55.412
and I couldn't tell him.

27:55.456 --> 27:56.544
Why?

27:56.587 --> 27:58.764
I was instructed not to.

27:58.807 --> 28:00.026
By whom?

28:00.069 --> 28:01.680
I can't tell you.

28:01.723 --> 28:03.943
JIMMY and DUCKY:
Vance.

28:03.986 --> 28:06.206
You know, I thought I was
good at keeping secrets.

28:06.249 --> 28:08.034
If Vance is the one
who told you

28:08.077 --> 28:09.557
to keep a secret,
then you're cool.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.124
While Gibbs is a big
dog around here,

28:11.167 --> 28:12.429
Vance is an
even bigger dog.

28:12.473 --> 28:14.736
Kasie, you have to
understand that,

28:14.780 --> 28:17.478
first and foremost,
Gibbs is a Marine.

28:17.521 --> 28:20.960
He respects
the chain of command.

28:21.003 --> 28:24.006
If he knew his superior
had given you an order,

28:24.050 --> 28:27.183
he would be upset
if you disobeyed it.

28:27.227 --> 28:28.750
Exactly.

28:28.794 --> 28:29.838
KASIE:
Really?

28:29.882 --> 28:31.057
He always follows orders?

28:31.100 --> 28:33.842
Always. Ish.

28:35.278 --> 28:37.063
Oh.

28:37.106 --> 28:38.891
Oh, I-I got a match.

28:38.934 --> 28:40.936
I ran the DNA I found
on the soapy mirror

28:40.980 --> 28:42.111
against the crew's DNA.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.246
And who does it match?

28:46.289 --> 28:47.769
JIMMY:
Oh.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.902
Oh, wow.

28:51.904 --> 28:53.340
Parker, come on, help clean up!

28:53.383 --> 28:54.907
Be right there, Dad.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.952
No. Now.

28:59.955 --> 29:01.957
Agent McGee, Torres.

29:02.001 --> 29:05.482
Sorry to bother you at home,
Commander, but we need to talk.

29:05.526 --> 29:07.876
You know, the benefit of
being stuck in port is

29:07.920 --> 29:11.706
I got to be here for
my son's graduation.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.099
Find out who made
the bomb threat?

29:13.142 --> 29:14.404
Think so.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.276
But first we need
to ask you a question.

29:16.319 --> 29:19.322
Were there family members aboard
the Ulyssesbefore it departed?

29:19.366 --> 29:21.977
Well, we had over a hundred
guests touring the ship,

29:22.021 --> 29:23.544
saying their good-byes.

29:23.587 --> 29:26.286
It's usual when it's
a long deployment. Why?

29:26.329 --> 29:28.114
Well, we found a match
to the touch DNA

29:28.157 --> 29:29.593
in the soap on the mirror.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.117
Well, who is it?

29:31.160 --> 29:33.902
Well, it's a 50% match
to you, Commander.

29:33.946 --> 29:35.382
To me?

29:35.425 --> 29:38.167
Not you, a, uh...

29:38.211 --> 29:40.213
a male relative.

29:43.259 --> 29:45.435
Parker?

29:45.479 --> 29:47.524
I didn't want you
to miss my graduation.

29:47.568 --> 29:51.224
I worked my butt off
to make the honor roll.

29:51.267 --> 29:54.053
And you were gone
so many other times.

29:54.096 --> 29:56.229
Soccer games,

29:56.272 --> 29:58.840
birthdays.

29:58.884 --> 30:01.930
I-I just wanted you to be here
for me today.

30:01.974 --> 30:05.412
Parker, I've been
where you are.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.676
It's just as hard
on your father,

30:08.719 --> 30:11.200
trust me.

30:14.073 --> 30:16.815
I'm sorry, Dad.

30:16.858 --> 30:18.991
I know.

30:20.993 --> 30:23.082
I'm sorry, too.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.617
Gibbs!

30:37.923 --> 30:39.925
Can't you see I'm pulling myself
together here?

30:39.968 --> 30:42.231
By painting your office?

30:42.275 --> 30:44.277
It's either paint it
or punch a hole in it.

30:44.320 --> 30:47.846
If Vance is gonna bench me,
I got to do something.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.113
What's going on, Jack?

30:58.291 --> 31:00.902
Let me help.

31:02.948 --> 31:05.167
Okay.

31:05.211 --> 31:07.039
Why not?

31:07.082 --> 31:10.129
We're both adults here.

31:11.565 --> 31:14.655
Help me with this.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.231
[whip cracking,
Masahun and Sloane grunting]

31:33.021 --> 31:36.242
Nine months
our squadron was held.

31:36.285 --> 31:39.114
The mighty Wingos.

31:41.116 --> 31:45.904
Every few days, Masahun would
find a new game to play with us.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.428
He wanted intel,
but after a few weeks,

31:48.471 --> 31:51.213
he realized
we had nothing.

31:51.257 --> 31:54.173
After that, the abuse
was just for fun.

31:54.216 --> 31:57.219
This guy's voice
is what gave him away?

31:57.263 --> 31:58.655
It-it was him.

31:58.699 --> 32:01.963
If only I'd kept my cool
and followed him out,

32:02.007 --> 32:03.704
I could've
taken him down quietly

32:03.747 --> 32:06.228
in some dark alley somewhere.

32:06.272 --> 32:08.752
It would've been
so much more satisfying.

32:08.796 --> 32:10.624
Not worth it.

32:10.667 --> 32:13.627
Oh, you think?

32:13.670 --> 32:17.761
Okay. Try this one on.

32:17.805 --> 32:20.503
It was towards the end

32:20.547 --> 32:23.898
when Masahun found
a new game.

32:23.942 --> 32:27.336
The lone female,
he figured I'd be the weakest.

32:30.339 --> 32:32.646
So he forced me to choose.

32:32.689 --> 32:35.954
:
No. No.

32:35.997 --> 32:39.218
Made you choose what?

32:39.261 --> 32:42.612
Who died next.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.266
It's okay, Sloane.

32:44.310 --> 32:46.007
SLOANE: Anshiri. It's okay.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.227
Hale.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.011
:
No.

32:50.055 --> 32:53.101
They kept telling me
that it was okay.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.016
Don't.

32:55.060 --> 32:59.151
Just to pick one of them
and get it over with.

32:59.194 --> 33:00.979
Please, no.

33:01.022 --> 33:03.155
Please. No.

33:03.198 --> 33:06.201
No. I'm sorry.
It's okay.

33:06.245 --> 33:08.595
So sorry.

33:11.163 --> 33:14.166
But it will never be okay.

33:18.126 --> 33:20.824
They're all dead.

33:25.264 --> 33:28.876
How soon after that did Vance...
show up?

33:28.919 --> 33:30.225
Uh...

33:32.140 --> 33:33.837
Days later.

33:33.881 --> 33:36.188
Masahun slipped out.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.193
Leon made the others pay.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.284
VANCE:
It's okay.

33:45.327 --> 33:47.286
You're okay.
Come on. I got you.

33:47.329 --> 33:50.158
You're safe now.
Come on.

33:50.202 --> 33:54.858
I've, uh...
I've owed him ever since.

33:58.819 --> 34:01.126
Explains a lot.

34:03.171 --> 34:07.306
Besides Vance, you're now
the only person who knows.

34:07.349 --> 34:11.005
Dies with me.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.356
Along with Masahun.

34:14.400 --> 34:17.925
Once he's dead,
I'll feel a whole lot better.

34:17.968 --> 34:21.189
I doubt that.

34:21.233 --> 34:23.409
What are you talking about...?

34:23.452 --> 34:26.281
My-my wife's birthday
was yesterday.

34:28.327 --> 34:31.156
Shannon...

34:31.199 --> 34:33.810
she and my daughter Kelly...

34:33.854 --> 34:37.858
they were, uh, killed together.

34:37.901 --> 34:40.382
And the man who did that,
I hunted him down,

34:40.426 --> 34:43.298
and I shot him in the head.

34:45.344 --> 34:48.129
And I...

34:48.173 --> 34:52.960
really thought that that would
ease the ache in my heart.

34:57.399 --> 34:59.358
Nope.

34:59.401 --> 35:01.403
Not to this day.

35:03.188 --> 35:06.191
And you're the only one
I've told.

35:12.414 --> 35:14.155
You don't tell me about Sloane?

35:14.199 --> 35:15.896
You don't think
it's important that...

35:15.939 --> 35:18.159
I see.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.161
Well, that's very disappointing.

35:20.205 --> 35:21.902
Thanks.

35:21.945 --> 35:23.643
Thanks for nothing.

35:23.686 --> 35:25.123
You should've told me, Leon.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.994
I had my reasons.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.778
I bet you did.

35:28.822 --> 35:33.000
The drone strike
that killed this Masahun,

35:33.043 --> 35:35.437
the man that
tortured Sloane,

35:35.481 --> 35:38.092
no DNA was ever run
on the bodies they recovered.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.789
He could be alive.

35:39.833 --> 35:41.313
And here I am,

35:41.356 --> 35:43.010
doubting Sloane's sanity,

35:43.053 --> 35:44.577
watching this whole thing
make her nuts.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.448
It's making her paint.

35:46.492 --> 35:48.798
She's gonna
hurt somebody.

35:48.842 --> 35:52.106
What do we have to do to confirm
that this Englishman is her guy?

35:52.150 --> 35:56.023
V.A. hospital in Reston.

35:56.066 --> 35:57.590
There's a patient
I need to visit.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.026
A patient?
Yes.

35:59.069 --> 36:00.201
A Marine.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.770
Retired Captain Chester Kelb.

36:03.813 --> 36:06.294
He's actually the person
that I was sent to rescue

36:06.338 --> 36:08.383
in Afghanistan
when we stumbled upon Sloane.

36:08.427 --> 36:11.778
Kelb, he was gravely wounded.
He was a shell of himself.

36:11.821 --> 36:14.563
He had been tortured along with Sloane and the other Wingos.

36:14.607 --> 36:17.610
Last I heard,
his PTSD is also compounded

36:17.653 --> 36:19.089
with early-onset Alzheimer's.

36:19.133 --> 36:20.743
What's he gonna give us?

36:20.787 --> 36:24.356
Maybe nothing, but when Sloane
and I met with Hakim earlier,

36:24.399 --> 36:25.618
I took the liberty

36:25.661 --> 36:28.011
of recording part
of the conversation.

36:28.055 --> 36:30.362
So much for you doubting Sloane.

36:30.405 --> 36:34.540
GIBBS:
Nothing like a little fresh air
to clear the mind, Captain.

36:34.583 --> 36:38.370
Why are the eggs
always so runny?

36:38.413 --> 36:40.459
You remember me,
Chester?

36:40.502 --> 36:43.201
Or do you prefer Chet?

36:43.244 --> 36:46.465
NCIS Special Agent
Leon Vance.

36:46.508 --> 36:48.554
I couldn't eat here every day.

36:48.597 --> 36:50.686
Me, neither.

36:50.730 --> 36:53.211
We met in Afghanistan.

36:53.254 --> 36:55.213
I helped rescue you
and Lieutenant Sloane.

36:55.256 --> 36:57.215
You remember her?

37:09.792 --> 37:12.839
HAKIM: My reason for running
was obvious, Agent Sloane.

37:12.882 --> 37:14.754
To the rest of the world,
you Americans

37:14.797 --> 37:16.756
have earned a most
unfortunate reputation

37:16.799 --> 37:18.236
for shooting one another.

37:18.279 --> 37:19.324
I have found, Director...

37:19.367 --> 37:21.021
:
Masahun.

37:21.064 --> 37:22.283
What did he say?

37:22.327 --> 37:24.329
...is best carried out
with a low profile.

37:24.372 --> 37:26.548
KELB:
No! No.

37:26.592 --> 37:28.942
No! It's Masahun!

37:28.985 --> 37:30.422
Masahun! No!

37:30.465 --> 37:33.468
No! No! No!

38:00.930 --> 38:01.931
Yeah, Leon?

38:01.975 --> 38:03.759
I just left the British Embassy.

38:03.803 --> 38:06.632
I told the deputy ambassador
that Hakim is Masahun.

38:06.675 --> 38:08.590
Yeah. She believe it this time?

38:08.634 --> 38:10.157
No, but she did say that

38:10.200 --> 38:11.767
Hakim was spooked enough
to charter a flight

38:11.811 --> 38:13.029
back to London this evening.

38:13.073 --> 38:14.292
Yeah

38:14.335 --> 38:15.293
She didn't know.

38:15.336 --> 38:16.294
How's Sloane?

38:16.337 --> 38:17.295
Gone.

38:17.338 --> 38:18.470
And so is her weapon.

38:20.776 --> 38:23.344
McGee, ping Sloane's phone.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.999
Bishop, call your friend
at the FAA.

38:26.042 --> 38:27.827
A man named Nigel Hakim,

38:27.870 --> 38:29.089
British passport.

38:29.132 --> 38:30.830
Chartered a plane to London.

38:30.873 --> 38:32.484
Find out what airport
he's leaving from.

38:32.527 --> 38:33.659
On it.

38:35.269 --> 38:36.749
Something on your mind, Torres?

38:36.792 --> 38:39.273
Gibbs, I know Sloane is
in some kind of trouble.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.840
Just tell me what to do.

38:40.883 --> 38:42.320
Put out a BOLO for Sloane.

38:42.363 --> 38:43.756
Find her before
she does something stupid.

38:43.799 --> 38:45.105
Copy.

38:45.148 --> 38:46.149
Boss, my ping got no response.

38:46.193 --> 38:47.629
Her phone
must be turned off.

38:47.673 --> 38:50.371
McGee, you've been
working on this for Vance.

38:50.415 --> 38:52.155
What'd you find out
about Nigel Hakim?

38:52.199 --> 38:55.550
Well, he's raised millions for
charity over the last 15 years.

38:55.594 --> 38:56.725
Record's clean.

38:56.769 --> 38:58.858
Maybe it's too clean.

38:58.901 --> 39:00.686
Ellie. This about
the class reunion

39:00.729 --> 39:01.774
or something NCIS related?

39:01.817 --> 39:03.341
The latter, Heather.

39:03.384 --> 39:05.343
We're trying to track a charter
from a nearby airport

39:05.386 --> 39:06.431
to somewhere near London.

39:06.474 --> 39:08.389
Don't you talk
with your fellow agents?

39:08.433 --> 39:09.434
What?

39:09.477 --> 39:10.957
I just got off the phone

39:11.000 --> 39:13.307
with Special Agent Sloane
who asked the same question.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.264
What did you tell her?

39:14.308 --> 39:15.440
One second.

39:15.483 --> 39:17.920
A charter company
filed a flight plan

39:17.964 --> 39:21.402
from Linwood Airfield, Maryland,
to London Gatwick.

39:21.446 --> 39:23.186
Gulfstream G4.

39:23.230 --> 39:26.233
Tail number
November-3-5-4-Hotel.

39:26.276 --> 39:28.191
Three crew, one passenger.

39:28.235 --> 39:31.456
Expected departure 22:15.

39:31.499 --> 39:33.675
Have Linwood Airfield
hold the plane.

39:33.719 --> 39:35.982
Don't mention NCIS
and don't give them a reason.

39:36.025 --> 39:37.940
Copy that.

39:55.654 --> 39:57.656
All right.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.229
Always knew there was
something about Sloane.

40:06.273 --> 40:08.406
Something like?

40:08.449 --> 40:09.929
Secrets.

40:09.972 --> 40:12.453
Complicated.

40:12.497 --> 40:15.456
I like that.
Little mystery, you know?

40:16.762 --> 40:18.764
♪

40:39.306 --> 40:40.742
Don't.

40:43.353 --> 40:46.531
After your wife and daughter
were killed,

40:46.574 --> 40:48.968
could anyone talk you out
of doing what you did?
No.

40:49.011 --> 40:50.535
I'm not here to stop you.

40:50.578 --> 40:53.320
I'm just saying you
can't take him alone.

40:55.540 --> 40:57.324
Hey!
NCIS!

40:57.367 --> 40:59.195
Step away from the plane.

Your passenger,
get him out here.

41:02.329 --> 41:04.113
We're taking him
into custody.

41:04.157 --> 41:06.986
Good luck.
There is no passenger.

41:07.029 --> 41:08.988
Where is he?

41:09.031 --> 41:11.860
Whoever he is, he just called
and canceled the flight.

41:11.904 --> 41:13.471
Guy booked another
charter out of Reagan.

41:13.514 --> 41:15.647
Took off about
ten minutes ago.

41:15.690 --> 41:18.388
He double-booked.
It's a decoy.

41:18.432 --> 41:22.436
Which means he's somewhere
over the Atlantic right now.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.220
We lost him, Gibbs.
