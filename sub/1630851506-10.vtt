WEBVTT

00:05.614 --> 00:07.616
It's pretty complicated,
right?

00:07.659 --> 00:09.096
Maybe it doesn't
have to be.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.184
I'm Eddie.

00:10.227 --> 00:12.099
I'm Anna.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.405
<i>Previously on</i> <i>
"A Million Little Things"...</i>

00:14.449 --> 00:15.624
I had
feelings for you.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.321
I just didn't realize it
at the time.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.802
I think I was too scared.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.195
You had a date the other day,
didn't you?

00:21.238 --> 00:22.544
You got me.

00:22.587 --> 00:25.025
I went out
with someone.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.809
Does Dad know?

00:26.852 --> 00:27.984
Camden: <i>I love you.</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:29.333
I love you, too.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.074
Didn't realize you two were
dropping the L-word.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.858
Sorry if that
was weird.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.512
My depression...

00:34.556 --> 00:35.513
it's back.

00:35.557 --> 00:37.341
Come here.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.387
I appreciate
you giving me a second chance.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.476
We all deserve them,
right?

00:41.519 --> 00:44.827
I want to thank someone
I leaned on today.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.524
Someone I love.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.317
Happy birthday.

00:56.360 --> 00:59.363
'Scuse me,
happy 30th birthday!

00:59.407 --> 01:01.409
Yeah, that's what
women like,

01:01.452 --> 01:03.063
when you point out
their age.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.414
You okay?

01:06.457 --> 01:07.850
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:07.893 --> 01:09.939
I just had
a weird dream.

01:09.982 --> 01:11.419
No, no, no!
Don't get up.

01:11.462 --> 01:13.377
I want to do the same thing
for you that I used to do

01:13.421 --> 01:15.075
for my mom
on her birthday.

01:15.118 --> 01:17.077
- Weird.
- What I used to do for her --

01:17.120 --> 01:19.253
get your mind out of
the gutter -- is bring her...

01:19.296 --> 01:21.081
breakfast in bed.

01:21.124 --> 01:23.126
Oh, my gosh!

01:23.170 --> 01:25.389
Oh, you used to do this
for your mom?

01:25.433 --> 01:27.217
Yep.
As the story goes,

01:27.261 --> 01:29.089
I used to eat her breakfast
before she could.

01:30.525 --> 01:31.830
Fine.
The rest is for you.

01:33.310 --> 01:37.009
This is so sweet,
but I'm not really hungry.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.402
Okay, great,
more for me.

01:38.446 --> 01:41.275
Look out.
Coming in.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.711
Oh, yeah.

01:42.754 --> 01:44.582
Well, hey, make sure
you're hungry by tonight, okay?

01:44.626 --> 01:46.367
Mm.'Cause after you get off work,

01:46.410 --> 01:48.238
I want us to get dressed up
and I want to take you out for

01:48.282 --> 01:50.545
a very fancy
birthday dinner.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.938
You know what I'd really
like is if we stayed in

01:52.982 --> 01:55.027
and got takeout,
just kept it low key.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.942
Ah, quietly walk
into your 30s.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.988
Stay off AARP's radar
as long as possible.

01:59.031 --> 02:00.032
I get it.
Mm-hmm.

02:00.076 --> 02:01.904
Exactly.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.427
I'm gonna go shower.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.821
And I will cancel
our dinner reservations.

02:05.864 --> 02:06.952
Great.

02:13.220 --> 02:16.179
The good news is Maggie has no
idea about her surprise party.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.268
The bad news is that
she shut down my plan

02:18.312 --> 02:19.922
to get her dressed up
and over there.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.184
I'm on it.

02:21.228 --> 02:23.882
Oh, my God,
I love a surprise party.

02:23.926 --> 02:26.058
You make someone feel
like crap all day

02:26.102 --> 02:27.321
<i>thinking you forgot</i> <i>
their birthday</i>

02:27.364 --> 02:28.887
only to wait until
they've lost all faith

02:28.931 --> 02:30.846
in their friend group
to yell "surprise!"

02:30.889 --> 02:32.413
Oh, God, is that what
we're doing?

02:32.456 --> 02:34.284
Yeah!

02:34.328 --> 02:35.677
She's gonna love it!

02:35.720 --> 02:37.200
Leave it to me.

02:37.244 --> 02:39.898
Okay. Bye.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.386
Dude, I don't know why you
played it all coy

02:49.430 --> 02:50.735
with that labradoodle
back there.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.259
She's totally into you.

02:52.302 --> 02:54.870
Let's be honest, Colin,
you're not getting any younger.

02:54.913 --> 02:57.873
Well, you can't go back now.
You'll seem desperate.

02:57.916 --> 03:00.528
Colin!
What's going on, my man?

03:00.571 --> 03:02.312
Still hangin' out
with this loser?

03:02.356 --> 03:04.184
Kevin, I thought I made
it clear when I finished chemo

03:04.227 --> 03:05.881
I never wanted
to see you again.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.274
How you been, man?

03:07.317 --> 03:08.971
All clear.

03:09.014 --> 03:12.061
So, uh, go somewhere else
to drum up business.

03:12.104 --> 03:13.497
Did you hear about Gail?

03:13.541 --> 03:15.412
Yeah.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.371
But, uh,
she beat it before.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.676
She'll beat it again.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.243
How's Hector?

03:20.287 --> 03:22.202
He's been by her side
every minute.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.725
I'm supposed to go over
to the hospital

03:23.768 --> 03:24.682
and see them
later tonight.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.380
Well, please
give them my best.

03:26.423 --> 03:27.903
I will. I will.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.731
Heard about
you and Maggie.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.254
Really sorry
about that, man.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.821
Ah, it's fine.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.475
It was over a year ago.

03:34.518 --> 03:36.172
I've already managed
to sabotage

03:36.216 --> 03:37.478
another relationship
since then.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.264
No, seriously,
Maggie and I are still friends.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.265
It's all good.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.267
Yeah?
Yeah.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.835
Matter of fact, I'm going to
a party tonight for her 30th.

03:46.878 --> 03:49.054
Wow! 30.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.055
She did it.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.056
Yeah.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.841
Defied the odds.

03:52.884 --> 03:55.278
I can't believe she agreed
to a party, though.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.106
Well, it's
a surprise party.

03:57.149 --> 03:59.369
Oh.
Yeah.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.850
Look, I'd throw you an invite,
but, uh, it's not my party,

04:01.893 --> 04:04.896
and to be honest,
nobody wants to hang out

04:04.940 --> 04:06.289
with the dude that
gave them chemo.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.336
That's fair, that's fair.
I'll see ya around.

04:09.379 --> 04:10.598
Oh, no, you won't.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.643
I never want
to see you again!

04:12.687 --> 04:15.211
I was talkin' to Colin.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.169
And stay away
from my dog!

04:17.213 --> 04:19.868
This arrangement is so cool.
I wouldn't change a thing.

04:19.911 --> 04:21.304
God, I love
Modern English.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.306
I just want it to be
perfect for Maggie.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.307
And it's your first gig.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.178
Yeah, it's one song.

04:26.222 --> 04:28.180
Well, I'm gonna be there
cheering you on

04:28.224 --> 04:29.399
while you play it.

04:30.748 --> 04:32.707
Speaking of which,

04:32.750 --> 04:33.882
I wanted to talk to you
about something.

04:33.925 --> 04:36.972
I was thinking about
bringing Anna tonight,

04:37.015 --> 04:39.627
but I only want to do that
if you're okay with it.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.019
Are you kidding me?

04:41.063 --> 04:42.282
I was the one who
parent-trapped you guys.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.370
Plus, she's great.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.329
Plus, she's not my mom.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.986
Well, I'm glad
you're cool with it.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.858
I just feel weird 'cause
Katherine's gonna be there, too.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.295
Maybe I should call her.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.600
Not a good idea.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.298
On the other hand,
if I call her

04:58.341 --> 04:59.864
and make a big deal about
giving her a heads up,

04:59.908 --> 05:01.823
it's gonna make her feel like
I think she's still into me.

05:01.866 --> 05:04.086
Definitely do not call.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.262
Maybe Maggie's 30th
isn't the right time

05:06.306 --> 05:07.655
for Anna
to meet everyone.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.439
I mean,
don't let that stop you.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.006
The only reason
we know Maggie

05:11.049 --> 05:13.138
is because she crashed
my dad's funeral.

05:13.182 --> 05:14.879
Ah.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.794
Strong point.

05:18.535 --> 05:21.103
Okay, let's just keep
the appointment on the
books for next week.

05:21.146 --> 05:23.497
Thank you.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.107
Was that Dr. Heller?

05:25.150 --> 05:26.369
Yeah.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.632
Did you tell him
you didn't think

05:28.676 --> 05:29.981
your new meds
were working?

05:30.025 --> 05:31.200
Yeah, he says I got
to wait a couple of weeks

05:31.243 --> 05:32.549
until I know for sure.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.682
That's true.
It's only been a couple days.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.466
I know how long
it's been.

05:36.510 --> 05:37.946
I just don't want to go
a couple of weeks

05:37.989 --> 05:40.601
on the wrong medication
to start all over again.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.908
Um, I'm...sorry.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.738
No, no, I-I-I'm sorry.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.613
I'm irritable.

05:52.656 --> 05:55.442
And, um, I'm tired of not
feeling like myself,

05:55.485 --> 05:57.052
and I'm even more tired
of feeling like maybe

05:57.095 --> 05:58.706
this <i>is</i> my real self.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.363
I'm gonna cancel with...

06:03.406 --> 06:05.103
Dr. Heller?

06:05.147 --> 06:07.236
No, lunch with my dad.

06:07.279 --> 06:09.412
Oh, Rome, I really think
it's good for you to get out.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.936
Yeah, probably.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.764
But if I go out with my dad
feeling like this,

06:13.808 --> 06:16.332
then I'm on the wrong medication
and looking at murder one.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.472
Greta: Do you have to
run off so early?

06:25.515 --> 06:27.996
I feel cheap. Used.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.258
And not in a good way.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.435
I'll make it up to you later,

06:32.479 --> 06:34.132
but, uh, right now,
I do have to go.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.613
I have to pick up a gift
for my friend Maggie.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.398
Oh, right, it's her
party tonight.

06:38.441 --> 06:39.747
Yeah.

06:41.183 --> 06:42.663
Yeah.

06:42.706 --> 06:45.448
I know you want to
take things slow,

06:45.492 --> 06:47.624
but we've been hanging out
a bunch this week.

06:47.668 --> 06:50.975
What do you think about
you coming with me?

06:51.019 --> 06:52.760
You know, maybe meet
my fancy friends?

06:52.803 --> 06:54.718
Oh, um...

06:54.762 --> 06:57.112
Sorry.
That was stupid.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.767
That's the opposite of
taking things slow.

06:59.810 --> 07:02.857
I'm just, um --
am really new at this.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.511
Trust me, you're --
you're great,

07:04.554 --> 07:06.469
and I'd love to meet
your friends.

07:06.513 --> 07:09.472
I just think right now
might not be the best time.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.519
Oh. Uh, why not?

07:17.524 --> 07:18.742
There's something
I haven't told you.

07:22.485 --> 07:23.660
I'm married.

07:27.838 --> 07:29.927
Katherine, wait.
Please let me explain.

07:29.971 --> 07:31.799
Don't!

07:31.842 --> 07:33.583
The last thing I want
you to do is explain.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.455
I can't believe after everything
you know I've been through,

07:35.498 --> 07:38.022
you would do this.

08:01.611 --> 08:02.873
Hey.

08:03.787 --> 08:04.658
Thank you.

08:04.701 --> 08:05.920
Yeah, yeah, I know.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.704
Okay, she's here
right now.

08:07.748 --> 08:08.923
I'll tell her.

08:08.966 --> 08:11.621
No, I hear you.
We will fix it, I promise.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.145
Ugh.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.407
Is everything okay?

08:15.451 --> 08:17.148
Uh, this is awkward.

08:17.192 --> 08:19.150
That -- That was Jane.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.935
Apparently, the testing
on your poster

08:20.978 --> 08:22.110
has been less
than positive.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.546
They test
the posters, too?

08:23.590 --> 08:25.592
They test everything.

08:25.635 --> 08:28.029
And the pockets on your blouse
did not go over well.

08:28.072 --> 08:30.118
They didn't
like my frockets?

08:30.161 --> 08:32.337
Okay, well, what does Jane
want me to do about it?

08:32.381 --> 08:34.035
Hey, guys, what's
going on in here?

08:34.078 --> 08:35.689
Maggie: Oh, hey, Jane.

08:35.732 --> 08:38.082
Uh, Claudia was just
telling me about the posters.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.171
Posters?

08:40.215 --> 08:42.739
She means
the promotional photos.

08:42.783 --> 08:45.829
Oh, the -- the ones that
become posters, yes, yes.

08:45.873 --> 08:47.918
They look great, right?

08:47.962 --> 08:50.921
Is what people should be saying,
but they are not.

08:50.965 --> 08:53.315
Okay, so how
do we fix it?

08:53.358 --> 08:56.013
Well, um, I've given this
a lot of thought,

08:56.057 --> 09:00.627
and I think the simplest
solution would be if we --

09:00.670 --> 09:04.282
and hear me out here --
uh...

09:04.326 --> 09:06.720
Oh, you know what?
I have to take this.

09:06.763 --> 09:10.245
So, why don't you
tell her, Claudia?

09:10.288 --> 09:11.551
Hi. This is Jane.

09:15.032 --> 09:17.252
She wants you to do
re-shoots today.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.819
- Today?
- We have some outfits being brought in

09:18.862 --> 09:20.560
and someone to do hair
and makeup.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.605
Don't worry. Nick is
a beautiful photographer.

09:22.649 --> 09:23.606
Nick?

09:23.650 --> 09:25.390
I'm sorry, our Nick?

09:25.434 --> 09:27.044
- Angry Traffic/
- Weather Nick?

09:27.088 --> 09:29.569
We continue
to peel back the onion.

09:32.833 --> 09:35.357
Theo: I'm telling you, Dad,
wear this one.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.402
This'll get the ladies'
attention.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.666
Maybe Maggie has
a friend you can date.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.624
I'm just sayin',
be ready.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.672
I love
your enthusiasm, T,

09:45.715 --> 09:49.284
but why do we need me remarried
by the end of the night?

09:50.677 --> 09:54.768
I kind of know something maybe
I'm not supposed to.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.726
Okay.
What is it?

09:58.162 --> 10:02.427
I don't want you to get upset,
but Mom's dating some guy.

10:02.471 --> 10:04.081
She wasn't gonna tell me,

10:04.125 --> 10:05.822
but I caught her wearing perfume
the other night.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.520
And Max Oberman says
that his mom only wears perfume

10:08.564 --> 10:10.653
when she's on the prowl.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.481
Apparently, that's
what it's called.

10:12.524 --> 10:15.310
Listen, Theo, Mom and I aren't
getting back together,

10:15.353 --> 10:19.923
so I think it's important
for both of us to move on.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.883
Which is why you need
to wear this tie.

10:29.063 --> 10:30.325
Okay.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.024
Oh, oh! Mm!

10:34.068 --> 10:35.809
Ooh, delicious.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.420
Mmm, oh, baby, you gotta
try one of these.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.335
I-I'll try one at
the party.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.381
Okay.

10:43.425 --> 10:44.818
You know what?

10:44.861 --> 10:46.733
I don't even want you
to try one right now

10:46.776 --> 10:48.735
because it's missing
a key ingredient.

10:48.778 --> 10:49.779
You need me
to go to the store?

10:49.823 --> 10:52.869
No. What I need you
to do is...

10:54.218 --> 10:55.698
...get funky.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.500
Sophie knows she's coming,
and she's fine with it.

11:58.543 --> 11:59.719
You said it yourself.

11:59.762 --> 12:01.024
No one saw you
that night,

12:01.068 --> 12:03.070
so I don't understand
why you're so --

12:03.113 --> 12:05.333
Because, Ed.
Because you --

12:07.161 --> 12:09.772
Between Delilah and Anna,
you have -- you have a habit,

12:09.816 --> 12:11.774
a bad habit of dating
people that you --

12:11.818 --> 12:13.341
you have
no business dating!

12:13.384 --> 12:16.953
Dude, I get why I shouldn't have
been with Delilah, but Anna?

12:16.997 --> 12:19.564
She's the first person
I've liked since my divorce,

12:19.608 --> 12:20.783
since I've been
in this chair.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.742
She likes me for me,
and I don't understand

12:22.785 --> 12:26.310
why I can't pursue that because
of a mistake that <i>you</i> made.

12:27.355 --> 12:29.792
Theo just told me
Katherine's seeing someone.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.925
What, I can't move on?

12:40.150 --> 12:43.763
You're right.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.766
Whatever happens happens.

12:48.855 --> 12:49.943
Dude.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.511
She didn't see you,

12:53.555 --> 12:55.513
and I'm certainly not
gonna tell her.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.820
But if you want me to,
I will call her

12:57.864 --> 13:00.692
and just tell her
we're not going tonight.

13:00.736 --> 13:03.347
No, man, you don't
have to do that.

13:05.349 --> 13:06.960
I'm sorry, Ed.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.051
I'm happy for you.

13:12.269 --> 13:13.357
Thank you.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.098
While we're airing
our dirty laundry,

13:15.142 --> 13:19.233
you should know that the person
Katherine's been seeing...

13:19.276 --> 13:20.712
it's me.

13:22.149 --> 13:25.413
It's pretty freaky,
the stuff we do sexually.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.895
Our safe word
is "Eddie."

13:30.026 --> 13:31.593
Guys, come on!

13:31.636 --> 13:33.725
The key to a surprise party
is to show up before

13:33.769 --> 13:35.902
the person
you're surprising.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.122
Tyrell, I'm sure
you look beautiful.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.776
Let's go!

13:40.820 --> 13:42.517
Rome,
and I'm sure you...

13:42.560 --> 13:44.867
look like you're about to
run a half-marathon.

13:44.911 --> 13:47.783
Why aren't you dressed, baby?
We got to go.

13:47.827 --> 13:51.178
I'm gonna take a run.
I-I'll meet you guys there.

13:51.221 --> 13:54.094
Really?

13:54.137 --> 13:57.271
Just not in a great headspace.
Thinking maybe a run will help.

13:57.314 --> 13:58.838
Did you see
my headphones?

13:58.881 --> 14:00.317
I had 'em when I was
talking to Dr. Heller.

14:00.361 --> 14:01.623
Could've sworn
they were right there.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.887
Sorry. All of this
doesn't just happen.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.759
What's with...that?

14:07.803 --> 14:09.196
Those my headphones?

14:09.239 --> 14:10.501
Yeah, I had to borrow them
when I was getting ready.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.416
Mine died on the plane.

14:12.460 --> 14:13.896
I'm back.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.942
Can you not take
my stuff?

14:15.985 --> 14:18.292
That's what I do,
remember?

14:18.335 --> 14:21.121
Yeah, but you shouldn't.
Like, you really should not.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.557
Babe.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.298
No, don't "babe" me.
It's disrespectful.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.343
I'm sorry. I thought that was
sort of a running joke we had.

14:26.387 --> 14:27.910
Well, it turns out you are
the only one

14:27.954 --> 14:29.259
who thinks it's funny.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.313
No.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.889
Nick: Good. Better.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.934
Excellent.

14:51.978 --> 14:52.935
Worse.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.981
Much worse.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.417
Blech.

14:56.460 --> 14:57.461
There's a reason
you're in radio.

14:57.505 --> 14:59.115
Makeup.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.944
So, what exactly are your
qualifications for this?

15:01.988 --> 15:03.511
I'll have you know I shot
the Golden Acres

15:03.554 --> 15:06.209
assisted living facility holiday
photo nine years in a row.

15:06.253 --> 15:08.385
Never had a complaint, and those
people live to complain.

15:08.429 --> 15:09.865
They were Yelping
before Yelp.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.214
Oh, my God,
my Grampy lives there.

15:11.258 --> 15:12.824
Was it your idea to put him
in the turtleneck?

15:12.868 --> 15:14.565
I put all the men
in turtlenecks.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.002
The cable knit
brings out their eyes.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.394
- Oh.
- Yours are beautiful, by the way.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.876
Thank you.
You're the sweetest.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.530
Little less with
the chit-chat,

15:22.573 --> 15:24.140
little more with
the click-click.

15:24.184 --> 15:25.881
Nick: Apparently, she's
the boss of everything.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.753
Okay, Maggie, please, just take
a look at your posture.

15:28.797 --> 15:30.407
What are your legs doing?

15:30.451 --> 15:31.931
I know you're dating a hockey
player, but that doesn't mean

15:31.974 --> 15:33.584
you have to stand like a goalie
deflecting a slap shot.

15:33.628 --> 15:36.674
Yeah,
he's the sweetest.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.938
[ Cellphone vibrates ]
Oh, it's Cam.
We're good to go.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.113
Thank God.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.245
Wait a minute.
You're the traffic guy.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.377
Nick: And weather.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.292
Yes,
that's why I know you.

15:45.335 --> 15:46.989
You have the most
incredible voice.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.904
It's the timbre. That's what
you're responding to.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.427
And we're done.

15:50.471 --> 15:51.863
Oh, thank God.
Thank God.

15:53.126 --> 15:54.954
Hey, Maggie.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.607
You know,
you're all dressed up.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.087
It'd be a shame
to waste it.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.262
Why don't we
go for a drink?

15:59.306 --> 16:01.482
Oh, thanks, but I'm just
gonna head home.

16:01.525 --> 16:02.570
Oh, you can't!

16:02.613 --> 16:04.398
What? Why not?

16:04.441 --> 16:07.140
I mean, you can,
but you shouldn't.

16:07.183 --> 16:09.055
Come on, you're wearing
so much makeup

16:09.098 --> 16:10.621
they might even
card you.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.014
When's the last time
that happened?

16:12.058 --> 16:14.016
Uh, you know,
some of the things you've said

16:14.060 --> 16:16.366
to me today have been
super hurtful.

16:16.410 --> 16:20.501
So let me make it up to you
by buying you a drink.

16:20.544 --> 16:24.374
I'd love to,
just...not tonight.

16:24.418 --> 16:25.636
Um, I'll see you Monday.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.682
Okay, take care.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.598
Happy birthday!

16:32.904 --> 16:34.297
We have a problem.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.479
Hey! Bloom!

16:42.523 --> 16:43.741
Thought that was you.

16:43.785 --> 16:44.742
Maggie: Hey.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.527
What are you doing here?

16:46.570 --> 16:48.398
"What's he doing here?"

16:48.442 --> 16:50.487
You know, those are the first
words you ever said to me.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.141
About me, really.

16:52.185 --> 16:54.839
You mean when I innocently
asked what a man was doing

16:54.883 --> 16:57.842
at a breast cancer support
meeting and you yelled at me?

16:57.886 --> 17:00.193
It was an ignorant thing
to say.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.064
And I didn't
yell at you.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.718
Even if I had, I think
I more than made up for it

17:03.761 --> 17:05.328
with what we did
in the bathroom.

17:05.372 --> 17:06.634
Bathroom?

17:06.677 --> 17:07.809
I don't remember
a bathroom.

17:07.852 --> 17:09.289
Just get in the car.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.682
Fine, only 'cause
it's cold.

17:11.726 --> 17:13.467
Wow.

17:13.510 --> 17:15.121
Oh, that's better.

17:17.732 --> 17:19.951
You look nice.

17:19.995 --> 17:22.563
I always look nice. <i>
You</i> look nice.

17:22.606 --> 17:25.087
Why'd you break out the iron?
You going to a funeral?

17:25.131 --> 17:26.958
Church?
You finally find the Lord?

17:27.002 --> 17:28.830
Ha, ha.

17:28.873 --> 17:32.138
If you must know,
I have a date later.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.053
I'm trying this
new thing

17:34.096 --> 17:35.706
where I make
a <i>good</i> first impression.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.534
Wow, you must
really like her.

17:37.578 --> 17:41.408
Ah, well, there you go making
gender assumptions again.

17:41.451 --> 17:42.670
I don't know
if I feel safe enough

17:42.713 --> 17:44.063
to talk about this
with you.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.847
You just missed my turn.

17:45.890 --> 17:48.067
Yes, I did.
It's your birthday.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.852
I am taking you for
one drink

17:50.895 --> 17:52.984
to make up for that time
I yelled at you.

17:53.028 --> 17:55.465
- So you admit it!
- Which I do not admit.

18:09.697 --> 18:12.482
How long has it been
bad like this?

18:13.962 --> 18:15.355
Couple of weeks.

18:19.402 --> 18:22.188
Last year when I was
giving Rome crap about
not going to the protest

18:22.231 --> 18:25.974
and you told me I had no idea
what I was talking about...

18:26.017 --> 18:28.498
is this what you meant?

18:28.542 --> 18:30.413
Yeah.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.600
This joint has a rooftop
with a view of the whole city.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.646
Mm.
It'll be fun.

18:51.695 --> 18:54.133
Hey, Mendez.

18:54.176 --> 18:57.788
For the record, I'm really glad
you yelled at me that day.

18:57.832 --> 19:01.096
If you hadn't walked into
my life, I wouldn't be here.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.452
After everything
we've been through,

19:09.496 --> 19:11.324
I'm pretty sure you're
the only person

19:11.367 --> 19:14.588
who truly understands what
turning 30 means for me.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.331
Cam wanted to take me
out to this big dinner

19:18.374 --> 19:21.072
to celebrate, and I...

19:21.116 --> 19:24.815
I just -- I couldn't
take the chance.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.775
I know
it's superstitious,

19:27.818 --> 19:29.429
but that's --
that's just where I am.

19:35.565 --> 19:36.740
What are you doing?

19:36.784 --> 19:38.481
Mm...

19:38.525 --> 19:41.832
Yep, yeah, there's
a huge surprise party

19:41.876 --> 19:43.399
waiting for you upstairs.

19:43.443 --> 19:45.532
- What?
- Yeah, everyone, uh,

19:45.575 --> 19:48.665
you know is --
is up there waiting.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.756
So...the photo shoot?

19:52.800 --> 19:56.238
Just a ruse to
get you all dressed up.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.153
So people really did
like my frockets.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.721
I don't know what you're saying,
but -- but probably not. No.

20:00.764 --> 20:03.463
Look, Cam arranged everything.

20:03.506 --> 20:04.855
He --
He hired the stylist,

20:04.899 --> 20:07.771
he bought you that...
amazing outfit,

20:07.815 --> 20:09.860
put together
the whole evening.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.993
But I told him I wanted
to stay in.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.474
Maggie.

20:14.517 --> 20:15.823
He didn't know.

20:18.173 --> 20:21.307
And by the time he invited me,
it was too late to stop it,

20:21.350 --> 20:25.049
but -- but --
but I think you should go.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.661
Gary --Listen, I get it.

20:27.704 --> 20:28.966
You're talking to
the most superstitious dude

20:29.010 --> 20:30.229
on the planet.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.318
I just kissed my valet ticket
with my mouth.

20:32.361 --> 20:33.580
'Cause I'm pretty sure
if I don't,

20:33.623 --> 20:35.190
something will happen
to my car.

20:36.583 --> 20:39.368
When we went to Elena's
remission party last year,

20:39.412 --> 20:42.371
you told her not to let
the fear of cancer

20:42.415 --> 20:44.721
stop her from living.

20:44.765 --> 20:47.594
So why are you
letting it?

20:47.637 --> 20:49.291
Okay,
you don't want to go,

20:49.335 --> 20:52.338
we'll get off on
the next floor, but...

20:54.427 --> 20:58.126
...the rest of your life is
waiting for you up there, Bloom.

20:58.169 --> 21:01.172
I think you should show up
for the rest of your life.

21:19.408 --> 21:20.540
Thanks, Gary.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.150
Anytime, Bloom.

21:23.717 --> 21:24.805
Smile.

21:25.545 --> 21:26.546
Oh, she's here.

21:32.421 --> 21:34.554
Yay!

21:34.597 --> 21:35.859
Whoo!

21:35.903 --> 21:39.298
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, my God!

21:41.387 --> 21:44.085
Gary, you told me we were
just going for a drink.

21:44.128 --> 21:48.002
Guys, this is incredible.
You did all this for me?

21:48.045 --> 21:51.266
Well, you know, they -- they
didn't want to, but I made them.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.833
Just kidding.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.835
We couldn't let
your 30th birthday go by

21:54.878 --> 21:56.358
without us
celebrating you.

21:56.402 --> 21:59.448
Happy birthday, Muggie.
I love you.

21:59.492 --> 22:02.190
Aww.

22:02.233 --> 22:03.496
Now let's go get you
a drink.

22:03.539 --> 22:04.975
Oh, yeah.

22:08.152 --> 22:09.371
Hey.

22:19.207 --> 22:20.730
Oh, Maggie, I want
to introduce you

22:20.774 --> 22:21.862
to some of the guys
on the team.

22:21.905 --> 22:24.038
This is Kyle,
and this is Devon.

22:24.081 --> 22:26.823
Three Bruins at
my birthday party.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.434
This is
pretty incredible.

22:28.477 --> 22:31.001
Before today, the most
famous person to ever be

22:31.045 --> 22:33.090
in attendance at my birthday
was Chuck E. Cheese.

22:35.441 --> 22:36.920
She's funny, man.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.705
Thanks again for
getting her here.

22:38.748 --> 22:39.967
You're a lifesaver.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.272
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

22:41.316 --> 22:42.709
I'm just, uh, glad
everything worked out.

22:42.752 --> 22:44.319
It totally did.

22:46.452 --> 22:47.844
Are you a Bruins fan?

22:49.977 --> 22:53.459
Yeah, yeah, I've seen
a game or two.

22:53.502 --> 22:55.330
♪ Ooh

22:55.374 --> 22:57.027
- Champagne?
- Oh, perfect.

22:57.071 --> 22:58.507
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.553
- Here you go.
- Ah, none for me, thanks.

23:00.596 --> 23:03.599
I, um --
I don't drink.

23:03.643 --> 23:04.818
Oh!

23:04.861 --> 23:06.863
Is -- Is it okay
if I have one?

23:06.907 --> 23:08.256
Absolutely. Apparently,
you're gonna have two.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.040
Feel like I need it.

23:10.084 --> 23:13.217
I'm -- I'm a little nervous
to meet your friends.

23:13.261 --> 23:15.176
Oh, they're gonna love you.
My friends are amazing.

23:15.219 --> 23:16.960
They are totally judgy.

23:17.004 --> 23:18.962
They say things that are
really inappropriate.

23:19.006 --> 23:20.399
One of them
is my ex-wife.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.183
But wouldn't trade 'em
for the world.

23:22.226 --> 23:24.751
Ah, well, that's interesting,
'cause we all talked

23:24.794 --> 23:26.448
and we agreed we'd trade you
for $11

23:26.492 --> 23:27.580
and a bag of kettle corn.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.190
Ooh.

23:29.233 --> 23:30.496
Hi.
You look great.

23:30.539 --> 23:32.585
I'm so excited to
hear you perform tonight.

23:32.628 --> 23:34.543
Oh, me too.

23:34.587 --> 23:37.720
Uh, Morgan and I kind of tooled
with the bridge a little bit.

23:37.764 --> 23:39.287
Can you come
give a listen?

23:39.330 --> 23:41.332
I kind of wanted you
to hear it before we went on.

23:41.376 --> 23:42.464
You two do that.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.770
I'm gonna go scope out
the appetizers

23:43.813 --> 23:45.162
'cause they're serving
something on a stick

23:45.206 --> 23:46.294
that has caught my eye.

23:46.337 --> 23:47.295
So I will see you both
in a bit.

23:47.338 --> 23:48.383
See you in a few.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.777
Excuse me.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.214
Um, did you have
some of those things...

23:58.175 --> 24:00.308
Uh, Morgan, I wanted
to show Eddie the new bridge

24:00.351 --> 24:02.179
- we came up with.
- Cool.

24:02.223 --> 24:04.051
Oh, and I-I wanted to
introduce you to Anna.

24:04.094 --> 24:06.053
Remember the woman I told you
inspired that song I wrote?

24:06.096 --> 24:09.012
Uh, she's just over...

24:11.145 --> 24:12.102
Uh-oh.

24:12.146 --> 24:13.582
Uh-oh?
Why "uh-oh"?

24:15.018 --> 24:15.802
Uh-oh.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.283
So, how do you
know Maggie?

24:19.327 --> 24:21.677
Oh, uh, actually,
I-I don't.

24:21.721 --> 24:23.244
I'm just here with...

24:23.287 --> 24:24.419
Hi.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.725
...him.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.647
I think I just met
your ex-wife.

24:34.690 --> 24:38.172
Um,
it's Katherine, right?

24:38.215 --> 24:40.609
Yes. Hi.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.481
Katherine,
this is Anna.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.179
It's nice to meet you.

24:46.528 --> 24:47.921
It's such a lovely party.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.270
So lovely.

24:49.313 --> 24:50.358
- I love it.
- Mm-hmm.

24:52.447 --> 24:54.536
Well, this is where I say these
carrots are delicious

24:54.580 --> 24:55.972
and head off to get more.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.889
Mm.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.848
Believe it or not,
that went much better

25:01.891 --> 25:03.240
than I thought it would.

25:03.284 --> 25:04.894
Okay.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.287
How great was it that
you thought everyone hated

25:06.330 --> 25:07.418
that poster of you?

25:07.462 --> 25:09.290
It wasn't that great.

25:09.333 --> 25:12.075
And this one had no idea what
I was trying to signal to her.

25:12.119 --> 25:14.338
Well, you were
going like this.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.515
What camera has a button
on both sides?

25:16.558 --> 25:17.777
I was doing this.

25:17.820 --> 25:20.214
That?
It was like casting spells.

25:20.257 --> 25:22.172
I'm never playing
charades with you.

25:22.216 --> 25:24.305
What's up,
lovely people?

25:24.348 --> 25:25.567
Is that Nick?

25:25.611 --> 25:27.003
I didn't recognize him
with a smile.

25:27.047 --> 25:28.265
Hi, Nick!

25:28.309 --> 25:29.484
Happy birthday, Magdeline.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.964
You guys remember
my plus one, Becca.

25:31.007 --> 25:33.009
Oh, I thought you guys
just met today.

25:33.053 --> 25:34.358
Yeah, we did.

25:34.402 --> 25:35.708
It's just
some light flirting

25:35.751 --> 25:37.100
with a 40% chance of
something more,

25:37.144 --> 25:38.188
but it looks like this
weekend's heating up.

25:38.232 --> 25:39.450
Oh, my God.

25:39.494 --> 25:41.148
Don't you just love it
when he does the voice?

25:41.191 --> 25:43.411
Oh, it's my favorite
thing ever.

25:43.454 --> 25:46.457
What? You thought that
Jiffy Lube was a restaurant?

25:46.501 --> 25:47.807
Until I was 10.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.025
I mean, my parents,
they never got us fast food,

25:49.069 --> 25:50.766
so how was I supposed
to know?

25:50.810 --> 25:52.768
Well, how about the fact
that the garages were open

25:52.812 --> 25:54.727
and you could see
three cars in there?

25:54.770 --> 25:57.512
I thought it was
a very efficient drive-thru.

26:01.342 --> 26:03.605
Hey, is -- is she okay?

26:09.350 --> 26:10.612
Would you mind if I...

26:10.656 --> 26:13.093
No, of course,
of course.

26:13.136 --> 26:14.268
Thank you.

26:14.311 --> 26:15.748
I'm just -- I'm gonna
take this, though.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.271
Oh.

26:17.314 --> 26:18.141
Thank you.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.103
Hey.

26:23.146 --> 26:24.626
I'm sorry.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.367
I, uh, obviously
should've called

26:26.410 --> 26:27.411
and told you I was
bringing Anna.

26:27.455 --> 26:29.588
I did not know
how to play it.

26:29.631 --> 26:32.503
But the last thing I wanted
to do was make you upset.

26:32.547 --> 26:36.377
Hmm. That's -- That's
not why I'm upset.

26:38.074 --> 26:40.163
I'm glad you're happy.
She seems great.

26:40.207 --> 26:41.730
Really.

26:41.774 --> 26:46.474
It's just... I was
sort of seeing someone.

26:46.517 --> 26:49.390
At least
I-I thought I was.

26:49.433 --> 26:55.352
Uh, but it turns out
they're...married.

26:56.484 --> 26:58.225
Oh.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.879
Yeah.

26:59.922 --> 27:03.665
Now I'm
the other woman.

27:05.188 --> 27:09.715
I didn't think it was possible,
but I feel worse.

27:11.499 --> 27:13.327
I just thought what
we had was special.

27:16.591 --> 27:19.376
Well, what did he say?

27:19.420 --> 27:22.989
Uh, I don't know.
I just left.

27:23.032 --> 27:26.688
What could you possibly say
after that that makes that okay?

27:29.996 --> 27:33.216
I'd like to be on the record
as saying nothing.

27:34.740 --> 27:37.830
But off the record...

27:37.873 --> 27:40.180
look, if you really care
for him,

27:40.223 --> 27:41.355
maybe there's more
to the story.

27:41.398 --> 27:44.010
I mean...

27:44.053 --> 27:48.884
I know with you and me,
I think we both knew

27:48.928 --> 27:50.756
before we were willing
to admit it

27:50.799 --> 27:52.932
that we were in
a bad place.

27:52.975 --> 27:57.110
And that does not excuse
what I did or what he did.

27:59.112 --> 28:02.593
But maybe they're in
a similar situation.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.780
Hey.

28:14.823 --> 28:15.998
Hey, hey.

28:16.042 --> 28:17.913
Hey.

28:17.957 --> 28:20.655
How you doing?

28:20.699 --> 28:22.265
I feel like crap.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.573
I'm so sorry.

28:25.616 --> 28:28.489
You're going through a lot, babe.

28:28.532 --> 28:30.360
How's Tyrell?

28:30.404 --> 28:32.275
He'll be fine.

28:32.319 --> 28:33.668
But he's worried
about you.

28:35.670 --> 28:38.107
I think you need to talk
to him about what's going on.

28:41.502 --> 28:42.982
Camden: That is the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

28:43.025 --> 28:43.983
Thank you very much.

28:45.288 --> 28:46.855
Okay, and this one,
I just don't understand.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.465
Uh, your parents cared enough
about your teeth

28:48.509 --> 28:49.728
to give you headgear,

28:49.771 --> 28:51.077
but then you got
a large soda right there.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.775
Uh, the -- the soda
is not what's wrong

28:53.819 --> 28:55.124
with this picture.

28:55.168 --> 28:57.170
Oh, just wait till you see
the potty training ones.

28:57.213 --> 28:58.911
What?
Yeah.

28:58.954 --> 29:00.216
I am gonna kill her.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.306
What is her problem?

29:03.350 --> 29:06.048
This is not okay.

29:15.275 --> 29:18.191
I heard
your band was playing.

29:18.234 --> 29:19.845
Break a leg tonight.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.107
Thanks.

29:28.854 --> 29:31.117
Hey, wait, wait.
Hey, excuse me.

29:31.160 --> 29:34.076
Uh... I know you.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.251
Right?

29:35.295 --> 29:36.557
Do you?

29:36.600 --> 29:38.298
Yeah.

29:38.341 --> 29:40.517
Yes.

29:40.561 --> 29:43.825
Uh, you were
in the room when, uh...

29:43.869 --> 29:45.914
Sophie auditioned
for your husband.

29:45.958 --> 29:47.481
Ex-husband.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.007
I just --
I never forget a face.

29:52.051 --> 29:55.837
Well, on behalf of my face,
I'm very sorry.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.145
Uh, it's good
to see you again.

29:59.188 --> 30:00.668
No, wait, that's not it.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.542
No?

30:18.425 --> 30:20.819
I saw you in front
of my house.

30:26.346 --> 30:28.827
You're the one
that attacked Peter.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.404
It was you.

30:44.016 --> 30:48.020
Uh, I mean, I-I-I heard about,
uh, what happened to Peter.

30:48.063 --> 30:50.283
It was terrible,
but I-I...

30:50.326 --> 30:52.676
I saw you parked
outside of our house

30:52.720 --> 30:53.852
a few weeks before
the attack.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.245
You dri--
You drive a dark SUV.

30:56.289 --> 30:58.073
I saw you
sitting in your car,

30:58.117 --> 30:59.814
and as soon as I got home,
you left.

31:01.816 --> 31:05.254
But then, obviously,
you came back.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.610
I'll do whatever
you want, okay?

31:15.569 --> 31:16.962
Please...

31:17.005 --> 31:18.920
Hey.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.356
Okay, I...

31:20.400 --> 31:21.749
Not here.

31:26.058 --> 31:29.757
Do you know, when I met you
at that audition,

31:29.800 --> 31:31.411
I was standing
with a clipboard

31:31.454 --> 31:34.980
that had at least
15 girls' names on it.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.853
And I have no idea

31:38.897 --> 31:41.334
how many of those girls
he hurt.

31:42.857 --> 31:45.904
And if he hadn't been
in the hospital...

31:48.123 --> 31:50.125
...I don't know that I ever
would've found out.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.091
He got what
he had coming to him.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.139
Your secret's safe
with me.

32:16.630 --> 32:20.286
Hey.

32:21.722 --> 32:23.811
Sorry about earlier, man.

32:23.854 --> 32:26.683
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

32:26.727 --> 32:30.774
Hopefully you can forgive me,
but what I did is not okay.

32:32.515 --> 32:35.823
Truth is,
I struggle sometimes...

32:37.346 --> 32:39.479
...with depression.

32:39.522 --> 32:41.350
Yeah, I-I know.

32:41.394 --> 32:45.137
Yeah, but there's some stuff
that you don't know.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.487
A couple years ago...

32:49.445 --> 32:51.099
...I tried to end it.

32:53.188 --> 32:55.277
I didn't tell you
because I was afraid

32:55.321 --> 32:57.976
you'd look at me
that way.

32:59.673 --> 33:01.718
Like I was fragile,
which I am.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.068
Which we all are.

33:03.111 --> 33:06.245
Yes, but except you once
told me

33:06.288 --> 33:08.943
that I'm the only man

33:08.987 --> 33:12.207
who's ever really
shown up for you.

33:12.251 --> 33:15.210
The reason I kept it from you
is because I didn't want you

33:15.254 --> 33:17.647
to feel like you
couldn't lean on me.

33:19.954 --> 33:23.044
You're right.

33:23.088 --> 33:26.352
I think I do put you
on a pedestal.

33:26.395 --> 33:28.789
But it's -- it's like
those headphones.

33:28.832 --> 33:29.920
Tyrell, I don't care
about the headphones.

33:29.964 --> 33:32.358
No, no,
just let me finish.

33:32.401 --> 33:35.535
The headphones
are a metaphor.

33:35.578 --> 33:38.277
I keep taking them from you,
but if I'm gonna do that,

33:38.320 --> 33:40.148
I have to give them
back sometimes.

33:42.803 --> 33:45.545
I know
I can lean on you.

33:47.112 --> 33:50.637
But you need to know
you can lean on me, too.

34:03.128 --> 34:07.915
Thank you for bringing me in
to help out tonight.

34:07.958 --> 34:10.831
I don't know how I was gonna
make the rent without it.

34:12.485 --> 34:14.226
Well, then, tonight
worked out for both of us.

34:19.274 --> 34:22.277
Listen, I have been thinking
about what I did in Miami.

34:22.321 --> 34:23.844
Gina, I'm over it.

34:23.887 --> 34:26.064
Yeah, but I'm not.

34:26.107 --> 34:31.678
Like you said, you served
your time, you paid your debt.

34:31.721 --> 34:33.984
And someone as talented
as you should not be struggling

34:34.028 --> 34:35.638
to make ends meet.

34:35.682 --> 34:38.337
Thank you, but unfortunately,
that's just how it is.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.252
Not everybody sees it
the same way you do.

34:42.254 --> 34:43.820
Well, maybe the key is
to surround yourself

34:43.864 --> 34:45.996
with people who
do see it that way.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.435
Mm, that sounds great.
How do we make that happen?

34:49.478 --> 34:53.787
Well, Cam's teammates ate even
more dumplings than I did.

34:55.136 --> 34:57.704
And one of them asked me
for a business card.

34:57.747 --> 35:01.577
He's throwing a party
in a couple of weeks.

35:01.621 --> 35:05.146
Maybe we print some cards
and see how far this goes.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.161
