inside your belly.

14:31.163 --> 14:33.324

14:34.750 --> 14:39.619

and on its 28th birthday,

14:40.714 --> 14:42.045
the child will return,

14:42.966 --> 14:45.127

14:46.219 --> 14:49.302

15:21.129 --> 15:22.244
Emma.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.334

Time is frozen here.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.010
Excuse me?

16:12.097 --> 16:14.053
The Evil Queen did it with her curse.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.514
She sent everyone from
the enchanted forest here.

16:16.852 --> 16:21.266
Hang on. An evil queen sent
a bunch of fairy tale characters here?

16:21.356 --> 16:23.312
Yeah, and now they're trapped.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.358
Frozen in time.
Stuck in Storybrooke, Maine.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.692
That's what you're going with?

16:27.779 --> 16:28.768
It's true.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.315
Then why doesn't everybody
just leave?

16:30.407 --> 16:32.989
They can't.
If they try, bad things happen.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.571

16:35.704 --> 16:37.240
What are you doing here?

16:37.956 --> 16:39.912

-I'm fine, Archie.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.293
Who's this?

16:42.419 --> 16:43.750
Just someone trying
to give him a ride home.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.327
She's my mom, Archie.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.795
Oh, I see.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.588
You know where he lives?

16:49.676 --> 16:52.338
Yeah, sure.
Just right up on Mifflin Street.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.795
The mayor's house is
the biggest one on the block.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.255
You're the mayor's kid?

16:56.975 --> 16:58.181
Maybe.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.842
Where were you today, Henry?
'Cause you missed our session.

17:01.104 --> 17:04.141
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I went on a field trip.

17:05.775 --> 17:06.764
Henry.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.851
What did I tell you about lying?

17:10.238 --> 17:13.071
Giving into one's dark side
never accomplishes anything.

17:13.325 --> 17:14.735
Okay.

17:14.826 --> 17:17.363
Well, I really should be
getting him home.

17:17.454 --> 17:22.244
Yeah. Sure. Well, listen, have a good
night, and you be good, Henry.

17:26.171 --> 17:27.251
So that's your shrink?

17:27.339 --> 17:29.170
-I'm not crazy.
-Didn't say that.

17:29.466 --> 17:32.378
Just... He doesn't seem cursed to me.

17:32.469 --> 17:33.754
Maybe he's just trying to help you.

17:33.845 --> 17:36.587
He's the one who needs help.
Because he doesn't know.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.634
That he's a fairy tale character.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.307
None of them do.
They don't remember who they are.

17:42.938 --> 17:46.146
Convenient. All right, I'll play.
Who's he supposed to be?

17:46.233 --> 17:47.348
Jiminy Cricket.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.728
Right. The lying thing.
I thought your nose grew a little bit.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.650
I'm not Pinocchio.

17:51.738 --> 17:55.105
Of course you're not.
Because that would be ridiculous.

17:58.703 --> 17:59.738
I say we fight!

18:00.080 --> 18:01.320
JIMINY CRICKET:
Fighting is a bad idea.

18:01.456 --> 18:04.744
Giving into one's dark side
never accomplishes anything.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.829
And how many wars has
a clear conscience won?

18:07.545 --> 18:10.673
We need to take the Queen out
before she can inflict her curse.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.331
Can we even trust Rumplestiltskin?

18:14.094 --> 18:16.085
I've sent my men into the forest.

18:16.179 --> 18:19.171
The animals are abuzz
with the Queen's plan.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.598
This is going to happen
unless we do something.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.346
SNOW WHITE: There's no point.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.937
The future is written.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.011
No. I refuse to believe that.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.691
Good can'tjust lose.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.390
Maybe it can.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.359
No.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.020
No. Not as long as we have each other.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.815
If you believe him about the curse,

18:38.910 --> 18:41.401
then you must believe him
about our child.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.445
She will be the savior.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.536
(DOOR BANGS OPEN)

18:48.295 --> 18:49.876
What the hell is this?

18:52.799 --> 18:55.336
Our only hope of saving that child.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.460
A tree? Our fate rests on a tree?

18:59.139 --> 19:00.720
Let's get back to the fighting thing.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.298
The tree is enchanted.

19:03.393 --> 19:06.009
If fashioned into a vessel,
it can ward off any curse.

19:08.148 --> 19:11.231
Geppetto, can you build such a thing?

19:11.318 --> 19:14.185
Me and my boy, we can do it.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.643
This will work.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.736
We all must have faith.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.905
There is, however, a catch.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.865
The enchantment is indeed powerful.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.787
But all power has its limits,

19:27.542 --> 19:30.750
and this tree can protect only one.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.924
HENRY: Please don't
take me back there.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.424
I have to. I'm sure your parents
are worried sick about you.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.799
I don't have parents.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.719
Just a mom, and she's evil.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.014
Evil?

19:46.102 --> 19:47.717
That's a bit extreme, isn't it?

19:47.937 --> 19:51.395
She is. She doesn't love me.
She only pretends to.

19:52.275 --> 19:53.264
Kid,

19:55.028 --> 19:56.689
I'm sure that's not true.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.315
Henry!

19:59.491 --> 20:00.526
Henry!

20:01.326 --> 20:04.238
Oh! Are you okay?

20:04.329 --> 20:05.535
Where have you been?

20:06.039 --> 20:07.028
What happened?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.041
I found my real mom.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.125
You're Henry's birth mother?

20:17.634 --> 20:18.749
Hi.

20:19.803 --> 20:22.465
I'll just go check on the lad,
make sure he's all right.

20:28.395 --> 20:32.138
How would you like a glass of
the best apple cider you ever tasted?

20:32.690 --> 20:34.146
Got anything stronger?

20:37.862 --> 20:39.727
How did he find me?

20:39.823 --> 20:40.983
No idea.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.531
When I adopted him,
he was only three weeks old.

20:43.618 --> 20:45.358
The records were sealed.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.409
I was told the birth mother
didn't want to have any contact.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.578
You were told right.

20:49.666 --> 20:50.826
And the father?

20:51.000 --> 20:51.989
There was one.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.708
Do I need to be worried about him?

20:53.795 --> 20:55.706
No. He doesn't even know.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.377
Do I need to be worried
about you, Ms. Swan?

21:00.510 --> 21:01.966
Absolutely not.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.135
GRAHAM: Madam Mayor, you can relax.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.682
Other than being a tired little boy,
Henry's fine.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.473

21:10.854 --> 21:12.936
I'm sorry he dragged you
out of your life.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.683
I really don't know
what's gotten into him.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.810
Kid's having a rough time. It happens.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.476
You have to understand,

21:19.571 --> 21:22.813
ever since I became mayor,
balancing things has been tricky.

21:23.992 --> 21:25.823
You have ajob, I assume?

21:25.910 --> 21:27.946
Uh, I keep busy. Yeah.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.863
Imagine having another one on top of it.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.458
That's being a single mom.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.578
So I push for order.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.543
Am I strict? I suppose.

21:37.714 --> 21:40.797
But I do it for his own good.
Iwant Henry to excel in life.

21:42.302 --> 21:45.294
I don't think that makes me evil.
Do you?

21:46.264 --> 21:49.552
I'm sure he's just saying that
because of the fairy tale thing.

21:49.851 --> 21:51.011
What fairy tale thing?

21:51.144 --> 21:52.884
You know, his book.

21:53.021 --> 21:55.057
How he thinks everyone's
a cartoon character from it.

21:55.273 --> 21:57.104

what you're talking about.

22:02.113 --> 22:04.399
You know what,
it's none of my business.

22:04.532 --> 22:07.399
