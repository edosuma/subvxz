WEBVTT

00:32.760 --> 00:35.040
"Soccer has given me so much."

00:35.120 --> 00:37.160
"I've met great people."

00:37.240 --> 00:39.600
"Both champions, and fans."

00:39.920 --> 00:41.160
"But above all...

00:41.240 --> 00:44.440
...it has given me emotions."

00:45.280 --> 00:50.080
"Now I have the only things
that really matter."

00:50.280 --> 00:53.600
"My family, my friends,
and no regrets."

00:55.320 --> 00:58.960
"Now the second half
of my life begins."

00:59.880 --> 01:04.480
"I am willing and eager to prove,
to myself most of all

01:04.920 --> 01:08.200
that I can do great things
even without using my feet."

01:09.760 --> 01:12.000
"Thank you, everyone,
from the bottom of my heart."

01:12.720 --> 01:14.280
Darling, that's so beautiful.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.280
Did you write it last night?

01:17.840 --> 01:18.680
I didn't write it.

01:18.760 --> 01:21.200
-Who wrote it for you?
-This isn't mine.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.440
-Sorry, I don't understand.
-Understand what?

01:27.320 --> 01:29.840
-Whose letter is this?
-Antonio Cassano's.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.160
Antonio Cassano's?

01:33.800 --> 01:36.240
He's leaving soccer at the age of 35,
he's crazy.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.320
Hey, what did I do?

01:47.200 --> 01:50.200
-Number 1, Wojciech...
-Szczęsny!

01:51.080 --> 01:54.880
-Number 2, Antonio...
-Rüdiger!

01:55.160 --> 01:58.400
-Number 20, Federico...
-Fazio!

01:58.800 --> 02:02.520
-Number 44, Kostas...
-Manōlas!

02:02.960 --> 02:06.000
-Number 33, Emerson...
-Palmieri!

02:06.480 --> 02:09.680
-Number 16. Daniele...
-De Rossi!

02:10.200 --> 02:13.200
-Number 6, Kevin...
-Strootman!

02:13.880 --> 02:16.960
-Number 11, Mohamed...
-Salah!

02:17.440 --> 02:21.160
-Number 92, Stephan...
- El Shaarawy!

02:21.240 --> 02:24.920
-Number 4, Radja...
-Nainggolan!

02:25.480 --> 02:29.240
-Number 9, Edin...
-Džeko!

02:30.520 --> 02:31.520
On the sidelines...

02:32.440 --> 02:36.480
He was born a soccer player,
grew up a myth

02:36.560 --> 02:38.480
and then, a legend.

02:38.560 --> 02:42.400
Thank you, Captain.
Number 10, Francesco...

02:42.480 --> 02:44.000
TOTTI: ONE CAPTAIN

02:44.080 --> 02:45.520
Totti!

02:46.120 --> 02:48.840
Let's hear our radio listeners.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.560
TOTTI'S TRIUMPH!

02:51.960 --> 02:53.480
TOTTI KING OF ROME!

02:53.560 --> 02:56.920
The Captain is always our captain.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.720
He's like a god to us. Go, Captain!

02:58.800 --> 03:00.200
TOTTI THE IMMENSE

03:00.480 --> 03:02.400
NOBODY ELSE LIKE HIM

03:02.480 --> 03:03.960
Hi, what's your name?

03:04.040 --> 03:06.360
Seeing him play is like magic.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.040
THERE'S ONLY ONE CAPTAIN!

03:09.120 --> 03:10.680
I love him more than my husband!

03:11.960 --> 03:14.040
THE OLIMPICO CHOOSES AND CUDDLES
ITS GRIM CAPTAIN

03:14.160 --> 03:15.720
Poor husband. Anyway...

03:15.800 --> 03:16.800
'Morning.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.600
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.760
Should I say something?

03:22.840 --> 03:24.720
What? Don't say anything to him.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.720
Just train and don't worry.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.680
Did you hear
how they booed him at the stadium?

03:29.080 --> 03:30.120
It's his problem.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.000
What's the matter?

03:34.240 --> 03:36.800
The matter's that my age
didn't change yesterday.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.760
Even if Rome is on my side,
I won't get younger.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.120
-I doubt you will.
-Yeah. That's the problem.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.280
And Baldy has nothing
to do with it.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.480
I'm not bound for the trash bin yet,
but I'm not what I used to be, either.

03:51.880 --> 03:54.280
Rome is filled with people
taking my side

03:54.360 --> 03:56.600
but also people who think
my time is over, Vi'.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.560
-So?
-Yeah.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.040
What if they're right?

04:03.880 --> 04:05.920
What do you think?
You can tell when it's over.

04:07.680 --> 04:08.600
Like Cassano.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.120
Not the same.
Antonio didn't feel like playing anymore.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.640
It's different with you.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.200
Maybe you still don't realize it,
you can't see it.

04:17.360 --> 04:22.360
But I'm convinced that your time isn't up.
Not for a long while yet.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.160
Time is certainly not on your side.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.280
Time passes for everyone.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.880
But you already screwed time over once.

04:33.000 --> 04:33.960
Don't you remember?

04:37.760 --> 04:39.040
February 2006.

04:39.640 --> 04:42.200
The World Cup in Germany
is four months away

04:42.280 --> 04:44.720
and I break everything.

04:45.040 --> 04:46.080
Absolutely everything.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.120
It was supposed to be
my World Cup, but now...

04:49.200 --> 04:52.200
Everyone agrees,
I am not going to Germany.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.920
I felt like crying.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.080
But I didn't want to cry.
I kept repeating to myself...

04:57.680 --> 04:58.720
Don't cry, Fra'.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.160
Can I come in?

05:01.640 --> 05:02.680
Here she comes.

05:03.800 --> 05:04.920
-Fra'.
-Hey.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.200
-Hi.
-Hi, honey.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.360
How are you?

05:08.200 --> 05:09.280
How am I?

05:10.440 --> 05:12.760
-Does it hurt a lot?
-Yes, it does.

05:13.520 --> 05:17.840
-Mariani is out there checking the MRI.
-What for? It's all broken.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.920
-Maybe this time it's really over.
-Come on, don't say that.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.240
-Don't cry.
-I'm not crying.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.600
So, Francesco...

05:29.680 --> 05:31.520
The room is ready.
We'll operate right away.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.360
Right away?
Is it that serious?

05:33.840 --> 05:34.840
Fractured fibula

05:34.920 --> 05:38.280
and capsular ligament damage
to the left foot instep.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.920
-I'm done for.
-Let's see what we can do, all right?

05:42.320 --> 05:45.280
What's the rush? I mean...
How long would it take? One, two years?

05:45.560 --> 05:48.280
A normal person
would need seven or eight months,

05:48.360 --> 05:49.760
but your bones are different.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.600
Maybe you can make it in four.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.400
That's why I don't want
to waste a single minute.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.600
Let's go.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.120
-Can I come too?
-Yeah.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.320
Hey, don't make me fall.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.160
Screws.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.920
Your cap got busted.
Gonna need a 1.5-inch bolt.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.320
Sure, but...

06:19.040 --> 06:21.600
Is there anything
with threading more like...

06:21.680 --> 06:23.960
Professor, I've got it all.
What do you need it for?

06:25.120 --> 06:27.440
The Captain, here...
he broke on me.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.920
I'd suggest steel, slotted.
Star-drives strip too easy.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.560
Here: self-slotting.
German.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.920
A bit more costly,
but it's a guarantee.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.800
German guarantee?
We'll take it. Quality first.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.600
I'm not convinced...

06:43.480 --> 06:45.600
I know your type.
Allen key enthusiast?

06:45.680 --> 06:46.800
Love Allen keys.

06:46.960 --> 06:47.800
Here we go.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.120
-No.
-Yes.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.600
-No.
-Yes, yes, yes.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.960
-But I need to put a plate on it.
-A plate?

06:55.040 --> 06:57.000
Shush!
Let me talk to the professor.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.520
-Be quiet.
-Like this?

07:01.720 --> 07:03.640
No, I mean more...

07:03.720 --> 07:05.520
He wants it
a bit more German.

07:05.880 --> 07:09.640
What's this crap?
We want quality here, pal.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.480
Damn, that's big!

07:11.560 --> 07:12.880
-Yes.
-No.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.360
-Yes!
-No!

07:14.640 --> 07:17.280
-Still...
-What kinda plate are we talking, professor?

07:17.360 --> 07:19.880
-Steel, iron...
-A smaller one. Tell him.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.080
Play-Doh!
I got you covered.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.360
Play-Doh?

07:23.720 --> 07:24.800
Play-Doh.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.040
-Not Play-Doh.
-Yes, Play-Doh.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.960
-No way.
-We'll mold it.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.120
Not Play-Doh!

07:32.040 --> 07:34.120
-Play-Doh?
-That's what he said.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.120
Not Play-Doh...

07:36.200 --> 07:39.120
There's no Play-Doh. What do you mean?
Fra'? Are you dreaming?

07:41.240 --> 07:42.680
-Is it over?
-It's over.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.440
-Everything's fine.
-What does that mean?

07:45.000 --> 07:48.840
They shoved a hardware store into your leg.
And maybe your head, too.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.600
That's what I thought.

07:52.560 --> 07:53.480
How long was it?

07:55.200 --> 07:56.960
-About an hour.
-A little longer.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.080
Yes.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.160
-How long was it?
-Again?

08:01.240 --> 08:03.640
It lasted three hours, France',
but it went well.

08:03.720 --> 08:04.840
It's up to you now.

08:05.240 --> 08:06.320
You were great.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.120
Not even one tear?

08:09.200 --> 08:10.280
Not even one.

08:10.360 --> 08:11.200
Well, actually...

08:11.280 --> 08:12.600
Look, he's awake.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.400
C'mon, Ma!
Get him out.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.640
-Why are you like this?
-Take him away.

08:16.960 --> 08:17.960
Come on, please.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.160
-He wanted to come in.
-Come on, Mom. Hey.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.480
It's over, France'.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.960
-Don't you start crying, too.
-I'm not crying.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.000
-He's got my eyes.
-You're just noticing now, Fra'?

08:31.680 --> 08:32.560
It had gone well.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.520
It had gone well for me.

08:39.240 --> 08:41.040
Now, everyone was saying
it was up to me.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.760
It's tough shit
when they say it's up to you.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.600
It's all on your shoulders.
If you can't make it, it's your fault.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.880
I need you.
The national team needs you.

09:12.960 --> 09:16.680
There he is. Marcello Lippi,
the Paul Newman of Viareggio.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.480
Coach of the national team.
A determined, firm man.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.960
Italy needs you.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.360
-But--
-There's no "but".

09:26.720 --> 09:28.960
What do we say
when our country calls?

09:29.560 --> 09:30.400
I hope--

09:30.480 --> 09:32.360
Hope is for
the weak-willed!

09:33.280 --> 09:37.120
Totti! Get up!
Walk! Run!

09:37.520 --> 09:41.600
Well, he may not have said all that.
But he made me feel important.

09:42.200 --> 09:46.560
More than that... essential.
And he boosted my morale a lot.

09:46.640 --> 09:47.800
Then let's go, coach.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.960
I could make it.
I wanted to make it.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.680
Sirio's got
a nice present for you.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.120
And I did.

09:58.520 --> 09:59.600
And so...

09:59.800 --> 10:01.800
thanks to the latest
physiatric breakthroughs...

10:02.240 --> 10:05.000
-What's this?
-A trash bag. Can't you tell?

10:05.080 --> 10:07.120
-You're throwing me away?
-Why, are you my wife?

10:07.720 --> 10:10.480
Once it's on, get into the water
and do your exercises.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.320
The problem is it won't open.

10:12.520 --> 10:13.360
C'mon, Sirio.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.400
Darn it.

10:14.640 --> 10:15.640
Let me see.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.720
How the hell does it work?
This is tragic.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.320
Couldn't you do it earlier?

10:19.400 --> 10:20.960
I thought it'd open easily,
I don't know.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.280
-Roll it up.
-I'll put it on as it is.

10:23.680 --> 10:24.840
Seal it up with tape.

10:24.920 --> 10:25.840
Wow!

10:26.320 --> 10:27.800
-Nice job, Sirio.
-There you go.

10:27.880 --> 10:28.840
There you go.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.240
So with Mr. Lippi's uplifting words
and Baldy's commitment...

10:32.320 --> 10:34.320
Yes, the very same.
He helped me the most...

10:34.400 --> 10:36.920
Come on, Checco.
Is your ass too heavy? Go.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.240
...in his own way.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.040
Still, not two months later,
I was running again.

10:41.120 --> 10:41.960
More or less.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.920
The problem was,
the World Cup was now imminent.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.240
Hey, Fra'. Does it hurt?

10:52.480 --> 10:57.200
It does, but that's not the issue.
It's my head, you know?

10:57.280 --> 10:59.440
I'm always worrying
that any minute now...

11:00.000 --> 11:01.240
-Understand?
-I get it.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.440
But really, look.
Now I can even...

11:04.720 --> 11:05.560
Is it yours?

11:05.640 --> 11:07.360
I can lift it this much.
Yes. Can you get it?

11:11.320 --> 11:12.880
Fra'. It's Lippi.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.360
-Oh, dang.
-Mr. Lippi.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.880
Answer. Coach!

11:17.960 --> 11:21.640
-Coach. Hello, coach.
-Hi, Francesco, how are you?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.800
-Not bad, coach.
-Not bad isn't enough, Francesco.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.040
It's time for me to send FIFA

11:27.120 --> 11:28.600
the names of the selected players.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.000
Can I count on you?

11:30.920 --> 11:32.040
I'm in, coach.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.120
Yeah, France'.
Hell yeah. Yeah. Let's go.

11:35.600 --> 11:39.000
I wasn't supposed to be there,
but in the end, I was.

11:39.640 --> 11:44.040
Not only did I go to Germany,
but found myself in charge

11:44.280 --> 11:47.160
of whether we'd push forward,
or go home.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.240
In those moments...

11:48.800 --> 11:51.440
the world looking at you,
head swirling with thoughts...

11:51.960 --> 11:54.440
the injury, the leg that could
give up on you right there

11:54.680 --> 11:57.000
the other one that's shaking,
and if you muck it up

11:57.080 --> 11:58.760
it won't matter
what you've done so far.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.160
Your whole life

12:00.240 --> 12:03.000
you'll be remembered as the guy
who lost us the World Cup.

12:03.280 --> 12:07.440
So you keep focus, you think
you're a man and a professional

12:07.720 --> 12:10.800
that the only thing that matters
is your head, your nerves.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.320
You think about...

12:15.840 --> 12:18.000
There was this game
we played as kids.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.480
We tried to hit
our friends walking on stairs.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.920
It was called
"ducks in a row".

12:23.000 --> 12:26.320
Let's go over it again.
I got three. How many did you get?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.240
Three.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.160
You didn't even get one. Lousy.
Who wants to try?

12:31.520 --> 12:33.080
Pipsqueak wants to try.

12:34.560 --> 12:39.440
A bullseye on a moving target
requires self-control.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.040
The balls were all different.

12:41.440 --> 12:45.080
Leather, plastic,
volleyballs, deflated, punctured.

12:49.080 --> 12:52.760
With six balls, I got six ducks.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.240
I always got them all.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.200
In the end,
all that matters is your head.

13:00.960 --> 13:04.520
Francesco Totti!

13:04.600 --> 13:08.800
Totti, Totti, Totti, Totti!

13:08.880 --> 13:13.880
Totti, Totti, Totti, Totti, Totti!

13:13.960 --> 13:15.120
One-nothing.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.920
You already screwed time over once, France'.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.280
I think you can still
nibble off a little more.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.200
What should I do?

13:35.520 --> 13:37.280
-Pasta?
-50 grams.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.320
-Bread?
-No.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.320
-Desserts?
-No.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.520
-Chocolate?
-It's got sugar. No way.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.360
-Not even dark?
-You don't like it.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.080
Jelly donut?

13:48.920 --> 13:50.000
I'm joking.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.840
You'll have to piss blood,
France'.

13:52.960 --> 13:57.240
Train like never before.
A monk's life, a bird's diet.

13:57.680 --> 13:58.680
Iron discipline!

14:00.520 --> 14:02.400
-Pasta?
-Fifty grams, I said.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.080
-That's impossible.
-It's possible.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.800
They lied to you.
You can't even cook so little.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.360
-What do you mean?
-Make it a hundred.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.000
-Absolutely not.
-Hey.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.600
-Seventy.
-Eighty.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.600
Seventy.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.640
Seventy. Deal.

14:16.760 --> 14:20.080
Just let me put them to bed
and we'll be there. Bye.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.760
-Maybe I want to be a drummer.
-Come on, go to bed.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.800
In two minutes. It's ending.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.880
Not two minutes.
We're going out. Where's Dad?

14:28.480 --> 14:29.440
He's gone to sleep.

14:30.560 --> 14:31.680
To sleep? It's 9 o'clock.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.200
-Two minutes, huh?
-Yes, yes.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.280
Are you really going to bed?

14:46.560 --> 14:49.040
-Yes, in a second.
-We said we were going.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.880
Well, tell them we're not.

14:52.160 --> 14:55.080
-What dress is that?
-Why, does it look bad on me?

14:55.520 --> 14:56.560
No, it's great.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.040
I can't stay out late,
I have to sleep.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.640
Time doesn't kid around.

15:02.720 --> 15:03.960
And neither do I.

15:06.160 --> 15:09.360
We'll see
if Baldy leaves me home again.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.480
Glad to see you so determined.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.200
It will come.
If not today, tomorrow.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.080
But I want to choose
the way it ends.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.760
With a bang, my love.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.320
I'm sure that's how it will be.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.560
I'm going to bed.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.120
I won't be late.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.880
Why? Where are you going?

15:34.240 --> 15:35.080
You're still going?

15:36.360 --> 15:37.480
Yes, I am.

15:37.880 --> 15:38.840
Bye.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.280
Be careful.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.480
Hi, love.

15:50.160 --> 15:51.200
What time is it?

15:55.160 --> 15:56.040
That was quick.

15:56.840 --> 15:57.920
Come close.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.160
Doesn't seem like a good idea.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.720
Anto'! What the hell
are you doing here?

16:07.000 --> 16:12.960
Antonio Cassano, from Old Bari.
Weight: 167 lbs. Height: 5,8 ft.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.240
The greatest player
I've ever played with.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.760
Two feet blessed by God,
but zero discipline.

16:19.120 --> 16:23.080
With his talent, he could've been
among the world's best players.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.600
He came to Rome in 2001,
after we won the Championship

16:25.880 --> 16:28.080
He chose our team
'cause I was in it.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.200
He got in all sorts of trouble.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.120
Thanks to him, a new word
was added to the Italian dictionary.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.720
"Cassanata": a gesture, behavior

16:36.800 --> 16:40.760
or action typical of soccer player
Antonio Cassano.

16:41.160 --> 16:46.520
From the surname "Cassano",
plus the "-ata" suffix.

16:46.600 --> 16:50.080
Professor, what kind of gesture
or behavior are we talking about?

16:50.360 --> 16:51.400
Bullshit.

16:52.000 --> 16:52.880
Synonym.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.360
Great fun on the field.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.680
And a lot more off of it...

17:31.760 --> 17:35.600
-You're way too slow! Come on!
-It's the other way around.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.000
They're waiting for us. Let's go.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.040
You'll end up busting it
if you speed so much.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.880
I'll buy a new one!
Two, even! Let's go!

17:42.680 --> 17:45.080
It's 3 am. We have
to be on the field in six hours.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.640
Right! If you don't hurry,
we won't have time to do everything.

17:47.720 --> 17:48.800
What's "everything"?

17:49.360 --> 17:51.560
Go dancing. What else?

17:51.640 --> 17:52.960
Have something to drink

17:53.040 --> 17:54.960
eat a few pastries,
then another car ride.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.200
If it goes tits-up,
we'll get fresh wheels.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.920
He says if it breaks down,
he'll buy a new car.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.800
But you had to understand him.

18:03.880 --> 18:06.720
At the age of 19,
with pockets full of money

18:06.800 --> 18:09.480
if there's no one to guide you,
you'll get lost.

18:09.760 --> 18:10.920
Hi, Dad.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.280
-Look who showed up.
-Hi, honey.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.760
Yesterday I went...
Thanks.

18:19.520 --> 18:23.200
I went out for dinner with Antonio
and he took me dancing.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.760
Does that boy have no family?

18:25.840 --> 18:28.760
-His mother lives in Bari.
-The poor guy. So he's here alone?

18:28.840 --> 18:31.840
That's why I'm looking after him.
He'll get in trouble.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.160
Boy, is he safe now.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.680
-Does he at least have a home?
-He's looking for one.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.760
Enzo, did you hear?
Won't you say something?

18:42.240 --> 18:43.440
Come on.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.360
You're puckering up...

18:48.080 --> 18:49.560
I'm puckering up.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.680
When your lips do that,
words are useless.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.640
-I can't eat these.
-Especially in the morning.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.560
-It's all carbs.
-Whiskey at night is better.

18:59.360 --> 19:03.120
We took him in, and Sergeant Fiorella
tried to straighten him out.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.040
Antonio, lunch is ready.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.920
Anto', what is it?
What are you doing?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.280
-I was trying things on.
-What is this mess?

19:12.480 --> 19:13.800
I bought some stuff.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.360
I can see that.
Won't you tidy up a bit?

19:16.440 --> 19:18.320
-Tidy up?
-Tidy up.

19:18.720 --> 19:23.400
Tidiness is important.
Tidy outside, tidy inside.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.080
A tidy mind, that's what'll
make you a champion.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.280
Otherwise...

19:28.080 --> 19:29.400
You want to be one,
don't you?

19:29.480 --> 19:30.680
-Of course, Fiore'.
-Tell me.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.800
-Do you want to be a champion?
-I wanna be a champion.

19:33.880 --> 19:37.000
Then tidy up
and come down, let's eat.

19:38.640 --> 19:39.720
Get dressed.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.680
-Antonio!
-Coming!

19:59.760 --> 20:04.560
Here. Look what I made for you.
Orecchiette with turnip greens.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.320
No way. You'll make me cry.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.480
-I'm sure your Mom's are better.
-You're right.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.480
-They're good, they're good.
-No way...

20:10.560 --> 20:12.640
-Did you really--
-No, no, no.

20:12.720 --> 20:16.000
It's just a small thankyou
for all you've taught me, so don't--

20:16.080 --> 20:17.840
Again, Antonio?

20:17.920 --> 20:20.000
Tidy inside, tidy outside.
It's important to me.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.000
Look how big it is.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.120
It's important.

20:22.520 --> 20:26.000
Excuse me, Antonio.
You already gave me one. The same.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.920
-They're identical?
-He's crazy.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.160
Well, if it breaks,
you have another one.

20:31.240 --> 20:33.040
I even got...
Here's the box.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.280
-The watch's box?
-Look how lovely it is.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.400
The box is nice.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.760
Gosh, you can park your car in it.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.160
-What did I give you?
-Huh?

20:40.240 --> 20:42.040
-What did I give you?
-Me too? Thanks.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.280
Nothing.

20:44.360 --> 20:45.520
That's right.
Start eating.

20:46.440 --> 20:47.760
-Let's eat.
-Come on, let's eat.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.200
A family.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.360
We had become his family.
Until one day, tidying up...

21:13.600 --> 21:15.840
Antonio,
what's going on?

21:15.920 --> 21:18.720
-Hey, what are you looking for?
-I can't find my money. My money.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.080
-Your money?
-My salary.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.200
Did you lose it?

21:24.160 --> 21:25.560
Was it in cash?

21:26.000 --> 21:29.320
300,000 euros in cash, Fiorella?
It was a check, a check.

21:29.960 --> 21:33.360
-It must be here. Let's look for it.
-Yes, let's look for it.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.600
It'll turn up, don't...

21:36.320 --> 21:38.840
-Come on, give me a hand.
-Check your pockets.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.880
-Where the hell's that check?
-The hell do I know?

22:35.520 --> 22:38.160
-Fiorella, I'm telling you. It was her.
-Who?

22:38.240 --> 22:39.080
The maid.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.520
No, we trust her.
She's been with us for years.

22:41.600 --> 22:45.360
-I grew up with thieves. I'm certain.
-What are you saying?

22:45.440 --> 22:47.760
What would she even do with it?
She can't cash it.

22:47.840 --> 22:48.840
Yes, she can.

22:48.920 --> 22:51.000
You give the bank the check
and they give you the money.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.320
That's how it works.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.120
-The maid?
-Again? Yes, the maid.

22:55.680 --> 22:58.320
That's it. Fuck everything!

22:58.400 --> 22:59.600
He's out of his mind.

23:40.640 --> 23:41.840
What the hell...?

23:43.160 --> 23:44.560
Don't bring anyone else.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.080
I'll just get attached.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.000
Well, it's late.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.120
With this last "cassanata"

24:15.200 --> 24:17.600
Antonio suddenly left
his foster family.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.000
What are you doing here?

24:21.240 --> 24:23.120
-I came to save you.
-Save me from what?

24:23.200 --> 24:25.040
From the prison
you're building for yourself.

24:25.120 --> 24:28.440
You don't eat, you go to bed early,
you bust your legs training.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.640
There's life outside.

24:30.720 --> 24:34.600
Eat, stay up late...
smell the roses.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.160
-The roses?
-It's just a phrase.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.960
All this sacrifice!

24:39.480 --> 24:42.240
You should thank God
you've got all this at 40.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.280
A beautiful wife and family,
lots of money.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.320
Anto', don't try it.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.840
You say that because you've
never had discipline.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.640
No, I say all this because
I know how life goes.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.160
There's a time for playing...

24:53.160 --> 24:54.400
And a time for living.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.840
I'm living, Antonio.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.960
But I don't want it to end.

25:01.360 --> 25:02.680
Not like this.

25:05.400 --> 25:09.120
And I'm no longer a kid,
so I need one thing if it's to last.

25:10.440 --> 25:11.440
Discipline.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.240
-Again with this shit!
-You never change.

25:15.480 --> 25:17.080
No, I'm not the same.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.760
I'm a good man now,
a model father and husband.

25:20.040 --> 25:21.000
You know something?

25:21.440 --> 25:23.720
This second half of my life
is far better than the first.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.440
-What are you saying?
-The truth, France'.

25:28.200 --> 25:31.160
The soccer ball
is shaped like the world.

25:31.240 --> 25:34.400
-But the world is bigger.
-Nothing is bigger than the soccer ball.

25:34.920 --> 25:39.400
I'm a 100 times happier now,
without that damn ball at my feet.

25:41.960 --> 25:45.200
I'm scared I won't even know
who the hell I am without that ball.

25:45.800 --> 25:50.680
Think about it. I'll help you
like a brother, like you did with me.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.120
I do think about it.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.160
I do.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.760
Because it isn't time yet.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.560
And I'll work harder
than I ever have!

27:19.080 --> 27:20.120
Yes!

27:38.720 --> 27:40.520
-Looking good, France'!
-Yeah?

27:40.600 --> 27:42.400
-Not bad, huh?
-Damn!

27:42.480 --> 27:45.120
-I haven't felt this good in years.
-It shows.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.280
Let's hope
other people see it, too.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.280
Even Baldy will see it.
He'll have you play on Sunday.

27:50.720 --> 27:51.640
-For the Rome derby?
-Yeah.

27:51.800 --> 27:52.720
I wish.

27:52.800 --> 27:53.800
Four to one.

27:53.880 --> 27:57.960
The capital's 144th derby

27:58.040 --> 28:01.640
was absolutely dominated
by Roma.

28:01.720 --> 28:04.760
A one-sided match
from beginning to end.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.560
We'll see next year.

28:06.640 --> 28:10.240
Next year Džeko will score twice,
and our Francesco twice more.

28:10.760 --> 28:13.520
Francesco will score four goals
if he wakes up. Hey!

28:14.360 --> 28:15.240
Fra'.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.520
Upset about the bench?

28:18.400 --> 28:20.000
Nah. I'm used to it.

28:20.280 --> 28:22.360
-Then what's the matter?
-I don't know.

28:22.880 --> 28:23.880
Maybe that's how it feels.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.240
-How what feels?
-To realize you're no longer needed.

28:26.320 --> 28:27.200
Oh, come on.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.600
Fra', you won the derby.
Enjoy it.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.120
-You're still needed.
-Am I?

28:31.200 --> 28:34.520
I'm so needed they scored four goals
against Lazio without me.

28:35.600 --> 28:36.680
It was just chance.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.520
THE NIGHT BEFORE
ATALANTA - ROMA

28:38.600 --> 28:41.080
I clung to that hope in Bergamo,
the following week.

28:41.160 --> 28:42.200
That it was just chance.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.760
Yo. If I get the right card,
I win it all.

28:51.840 --> 28:52.840
Lower your voice.

28:53.160 --> 28:54.480
If the coach hears us

28:54.560 --> 28:56.520
he'll think we're playing cards.
He'll be so pissed.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.120
Hey, I don't see any cards here.

28:58.720 --> 29:01.200
-Yes, but look at the time.
-A quarter past midnight.

29:01.280 --> 29:05.880
Big deal. We're just 15 minutes late.
I'm sure Baldy's asleep.

29:09.240 --> 29:11.240
-Thank you, Ale. Bye.
-'Night.

29:15.240 --> 29:19.480
-Coach, what are you doing?
-I know you'll tell your friends now.

29:20.080 --> 29:22.280
Me? What do I care?
I'm going to bed now.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.080
-Sure.
-Goodnight, coach.

29:27.800 --> 29:28.760
Goodnight.

29:38.880 --> 29:43.160
-Daniele says the coach is out here.
-Shit.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.120
-Shit.
-Let's... just stay calm.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.200
-Be quiet. Where are you going?
-He'll catch us.

29:48.280 --> 29:50.200
Are you crazy?
We're on the sixth floor.

29:53.720 --> 29:54.920
It's the sixth floor.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.120
Hey, close it. It's cold.
You must relax, Radja.

29:58.200 --> 30:01.360
-He'll catch us.
-Relax, guys. Calm down.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.920
Fine. Let's go out
and act like it's nothing.

30:11.920 --> 30:12.800
Hey, coach.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.240
Playing dumb, huh?

30:16.320 --> 30:19.920
I knew what you were doing
in Francesco's room, playing cards.

30:20.280 --> 30:21.800
No, coach,
no cards involved.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.880
-Right.
-Just our tablets. Look.

30:24.680 --> 30:29.400
Trying to be a smartass, Mire?
Are you kidding me? Go to your room.

30:29.720 --> 30:33.640
We'll settle this tomorrow.
Go on. Both of you.

30:34.840 --> 30:36.480
-'Night, coach.
-Goodnight.

30:36.560 --> 30:37.600
'Night.

30:41.560 --> 30:42.640
Walk faster.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.760
If I had half a shot before...

31:01.000 --> 31:03.400
And in the front,
Perotti, Salah and Džeko.

31:03.880 --> 31:08.280
Come on, guys. Let's go get
those three points. Let's go, everyone.

31:11.040 --> 31:14.680
As expected, I watched
from the bench. We were losing, too.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.400
Yet another useless shower
after an un-played game.

31:20.640 --> 31:21.680
And it's a crazy game.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.000
We get ahead, 2-0

31:23.320 --> 31:26.760
then Atalanta rears its head
and we're 2-3.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.040
Three, four lost opportunities

31:29.120 --> 31:34.360
Spalletti knows that Roma
has lost control of the match

31:34.440 --> 31:35.840
No skill, no tactics.

31:35.920 --> 31:39.360
That's the worst thing
about this second half.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.760
Ten minutes before the end,
the coach lets me in

31:42.840 --> 31:44.360
to try and fix a broken play.

31:44.440 --> 31:45.480
What the hell am I?
A wizard?

31:46.760 --> 31:47.800
Yes, I am.

31:48.080 --> 31:52.200
I scored after three minutes.
Not enough for him, it seems.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.920
Checco, I'm sick of it!

31:55.160 --> 31:58.760
-Are you talking to me?
-Yes, to you. I'm sick of your shit!

31:59.200 --> 32:01.000
So, I had two possibilities.

32:01.080 --> 32:04.520
One: just let it go.
I'd done enough on the field.

32:04.600 --> 32:08.080
Two: tell him nicely
that I thought he was exaggerating.

32:08.400 --> 32:09.840
I chose number three.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.920
Hey, I got you your points,
you madman.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.360
You still want to be in command,
but you should leave.

32:15.440 --> 32:16.640
What did I do?

32:16.720 --> 32:20.320
Totti practically saved the game.
He was crucial.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.840
Wouldn't it have been wiser
to let him play from the beginning?

32:24.200 --> 32:29.560
If Totti scored it's because of the team,
not just him, right?

32:30.120 --> 32:33.360
Totti scores
because of teamwork

32:33.440 --> 32:37.680
just as when Džeko scores,
it's because of teamwork.

32:37.760 --> 32:40.760
It's always
the whole team that scores.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.480
Can you believe this guy, Vi'?

32:42.560 --> 32:44.040
-Did you read the papers?
-I have.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.480
-Did you read them well?
-Yes.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.400
You think it's normal?

32:48.360 --> 32:50.440
Unbelievable.
He can't talk like this.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.080
-I'll talk too, now.
-Just forget it.

32:52.160 --> 32:53.960
-Forget it?
-Think of Roma's wellbeing.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.800
Like I don't think of that?
It's all I do.

32:55.880 --> 32:58.080
We're not qualified
for the Champions League yet.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.720
But we're well on track,
aren't we?

33:01.040 --> 33:02.600
-That is all I wanted.
- I know.

33:02.680 --> 33:03.520
As for the rest...

33:03.600 --> 33:06.080
-You're answering him on the field.
-I never see the field!

33:06.760 --> 33:08.720
He'll let me see it again in August
after what happened.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.600
Well, you almost hit him.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.360
-So now it's my fault?
-It's not.

33:12.440 --> 33:14.160
Did you hear
what he said in front of everyone?

33:14.240 --> 33:15.160
I heard, I heard.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.120
The field.

33:18.800 --> 33:21.360
Don't say that to me.
It's all his fault.

33:21.440 --> 33:26.240
He'll never let me play again.
He'll get revenge. I'm sure.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.680
-It would take a miracle.
-Yeah, a miracle.

33:30.000 --> 33:30.920
A miracle...

33:33.480 --> 33:34.720
I don't know
if it was a miracle...

33:34.800 --> 33:35.720
There you go.

33:36.280 --> 33:37.920
...or all my hard work...

33:38.400 --> 33:39.440
The smallest one, too.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.760
...or all my anger at Spalletti...

33:41.840 --> 33:43.040
...or just dumb luck.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.880
Spalletti had me play
two minutes, and I scored.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.320
The minute I went in, I scored.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.880
Even score,
thanks to Francesco Totti!

33:48.960 --> 33:52.080
With Torino, with Genoa,
all vital goals.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.720
Francesco Totti overturns the game!

33:54.800 --> 33:57.720
That Championship final
was one of the best in my life.

33:58.960 --> 34:01.320
I'd done it. I had screwed over time.

34:51.560 --> 34:55.080
Let's toast to these years,
then we'll see what happens.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.240
-Put it down.
-Come on, a toast. I'll be offended.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.560
You have to give a speech.

34:58.640 --> 34:59.480
He's still drinking.

34:59.560 --> 35:00.840
No, no, I'll give the speech.

35:00.920 --> 35:01.880
You do it.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.640
No, I'll do it. I'll do it.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.720
-He'll do it.
-A toast. Calm down, calm down.

35:05.800 --> 35:08.440
To Francesco's future.

35:08.720 --> 35:09.560
Well said!

35:09.640 --> 35:12.080
To the future, France'.
Your future, honey.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.600
Let's make it
a future on the field.

35:13.680 --> 35:15.120
-Better, no?
-You're right.

35:15.640 --> 35:19.240
-Here, you drink this. Already got one?
-I'll take it.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.400
-Is he serious?
-Don't you know him?

35:23.960 --> 35:27.680
Vito, with an ending like this,
there's just one thing to do.

35:27.960 --> 35:28.840
One thing.

35:28.920 --> 35:31.360
-It'd be perfect. The perfect ending.
-It would.

35:38.720 --> 35:42.600
-Who's gonna tell him?
-Who? Not me.

35:56.080 --> 35:58.200
Great, France'. You were great.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.320
What are you doing here?
Still talking?

36:01.800 --> 36:04.200
After what you said?
"You're old", "Screw discipline".

36:04.280 --> 36:06.160
You were right.
I apologize.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.640
I've grown up and I can see
when I'm wrong.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.440
You showed them all, right?

36:11.920 --> 36:12.840
I did.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.160
Now don't be an idiot.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.400
End it now.

36:18.040 --> 36:21.080
-The hell are you saying?
-You couldn't end better than this.

36:21.760 --> 36:22.840
Trust a madman.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.280
Trust a madman...

36:57.560 --> 36:59.640
-You're happy, huh?
-Very happy.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.320
So am I.

37:01.440 --> 37:02.320
-Huh?
-So am I.

37:06.680 --> 37:08.600
You're a lucky man,
Francesco.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.400
I know.

37:12.960 --> 37:15.120
But you can't stop time forever.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.520
I think you should start thinking--

37:17.600 --> 37:19.520
I know where this is going.

37:23.320 --> 37:25.240
Can't I just be lucky tonight?
