<i>Previously on</i> One Dollar...

00:10.356 --> 00:14.183
- How much for the globe?
- Seven. I got to make a profit.

00:14.236 --> 00:15.615
No matter how big my heart is.

00:15.695 --> 00:17.829
<i>- Just tell me what happened.</i>
- I found ’em!

00:17.854 --> 00:19.299
What was I supposed to
do, leave ’em there?

00:19.324 --> 00:21.370
The cops shut us down for
more than a couple of days.

00:21.395 --> 00:22.690
The mill won’t survive that.

00:22.717 --> 00:24.689
There was a cancellation last minute.

00:24.714 --> 00:26.400
The specs on one of the crates was off.

00:26.448 --> 00:28.402
Don’t they check the specs way
earlier than the last minute?

00:28.426 --> 00:29.776
Like, before it’s packed?

00:29.878 --> 00:31.936
As a professional courtesy,

00:31.961 --> 00:33.419
- may I take a look at the scene?
- No.

00:33.449 --> 00:35.445
<i>It’s not the policy of the
Braden Police Department</i>

00:35.470 --> 00:36.799
<i>to enrich freelancers.</i>

00:36.919 --> 00:38.095
<i>Apparently, it’s not the policy</i>

00:38.119 --> 00:40.821
<i>of the Braden Police
Department to solve cases.</i>

00:42.237 --> 00:43.834
You know who Travis Wilcox is?

00:43.859 --> 00:45.762
He came by four different occasions

00:45.803 --> 00:47.115
and bought shovels off me.

00:47.142 --> 00:50.153
Age 38, lives alone, owns a
used car lot on Highway 42.

00:50.220 --> 00:52.323
<i>He’s bought 22
different assault weapons,</i>

00:52.347 --> 00:54.787
<i>seven .45s, four tactical shotguns.</i>

00:54.818 --> 00:56.320
Wilcox and an unidentified female

00:56.345 --> 00:57.649
on foot, heading east
through the woods.

00:57.673 --> 00:59.122
Braden PD! Stop!

01:00.340 --> 01:02.552
<i>- Now the party can begin.</i>
- There he is.

01:02.585 --> 01:04.090
None of this makes it
back to us, right?

01:04.137 --> 01:05.637
I’m insulted you'd even ask.

01:05.662 --> 01:08.052
What we might have here is blood

01:08.130 --> 01:09.730
from seven different people.

01:09.978 --> 01:13.046
It’s a party, people.
Let’s keep dancing.

01:19.708 --> 01:21.509
<i>What?</i>

01:23.145 --> 01:25.274
No, we’re in the van.

01:25.352 --> 01:27.511
Yo, yo!

01:27.567 --> 01:29.103
Rich!

01:30.158 --> 01:32.336
Here we are.

01:34.455 --> 01:36.477
- What’s that?
- This is an accordion.

01:36.525 --> 01:38.510
- Here, let’s see how she does it.
- Hey, you got a beer?

01:38.549 --> 01:40.979
- I want to get a little tuned up.
- Yeah.

01:43.508 --> 01:44.915
There you go.

01:45.079 --> 01:46.847
Fingers here.

01:47.334 --> 01:50.167
Wow, that’s great,
sweetie, that’s great.

01:50.256 --> 01:52.148
- A natural.
- Yup.

02:00.947 --> 02:02.608
Game time.

02:03.892 --> 02:06.505
You can keep playing,
cupcake, sounds great.

02:09.039 --> 02:10.419
How was everything today?

02:10.525 --> 02:13.627
Incred-i-ble.

02:17.998 --> 02:19.712
- This is embarrassing.
- Oh, come on.

02:19.768 --> 02:21.164
No, hey, l-look,

02:21.242 --> 02:23.277
I-it’s only a 20-minute
walk back to our apartment.

02:23.302 --> 02:24.536
I got to go get my wallet.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.096
I have to call the cops?

02:26.234 --> 02:27.701
No, no, no, no, no.

02:27.976 --> 02:29.944
Ah.

02:29.971 --> 02:32.079
Look. Honey, give me this.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.915
Hold on to this, okay?

02:35.940 --> 02:38.476
It’s my daughters prize possession.

02:38.746 --> 02:41.549
Worth 50, maybe 100.

02:44.393 --> 02:45.727
Oh, you’re an angel.

02:46.057 --> 02:47.583
Come... Honey, come on,

02:47.635 --> 02:49.962
so that we can pay the nice lady.

03:06.454 --> 03:08.222
That was delicious.

03:15.924 --> 03:17.240
That...

03:17.292 --> 03:19.696
Can I take a look at that accordion?

03:22.727 --> 03:24.628
That’s a 1930s Höhner.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.774
That’s very, very rare.

03:26.853 --> 03:28.722
- It’s not for sale, is it?
- No.

03:28.789 --> 03:30.615
Somebody left it, but
he’s coming back for it.

03:30.671 --> 03:34.042
Oh, that’s too bad. Well...

03:36.278 --> 03:37.616
You know, I-I tell you what.

03:37.657 --> 03:39.426
Would you mind giving him my card,

03:39.480 --> 03:41.821
tell him I’m considering buying it?

03:42.082 --> 03:44.840
I’d give him, uh, two...

03:45.947 --> 03:48.389
maybe three thousand.

03:48.859 --> 03:50.758
Yeah. Sure.

03:51.071 --> 03:53.207
Thanks, doll.

03:59.793 --> 04:01.986
As promised. Hey, oh...

04:02.343 --> 04:04.923
Thank you, and keep the change.

04:04.948 --> 04:06.484
Thank you.

04:08.296 --> 04:09.831
Ah...

04:09.911 --> 04:12.746
How much would you sell
the accordion for?

04:13.457 --> 04:16.079
Oh, no, it-it’s not for sale.

04:16.149 --> 04:17.386
You know, I really like it.

04:18.140 --> 04:20.050
What if I was to offer you $200?

04:20.214 --> 04:22.558
Mm... No, no, no.

04:22.645 --> 04:25.748
I can’t sell it, you know? Sorry.

04:26.595 --> 04:28.330
Okay, let’s go, cupcake.

04:28.763 --> 04:30.332
Wait.

04:31.070 --> 04:33.035
What about $500?

04:37.824 --> 04:40.226
Ba-boom.

04:40.935 --> 04:42.469
Chels!

04:42.977 --> 04:45.242
Don’t be sad, cupcake.

04:45.267 --> 04:47.164
Good things are coming our way.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.657
I’ll buy you five
accordions if you want.

04:58.645 --> 05:00.045
Deli, pick up line two.

05:00.521 --> 05:02.689
Deli, pick up line two.

05:04.591 --> 05:05.667
Hello.

05:05.700 --> 05:06.778
Hello.

05:06.803 --> 05:08.839
How are you?

05:08.935 --> 05:10.422
Can I take my break now?

05:10.475 --> 05:12.439
All right, hon.

05:15.749 --> 05:19.013
That’s gonna be $16.42.

05:19.173 --> 05:20.743
Would you like the receipt in your bag?

05:20.781 --> 05:22.716
Yes, please. Thank you.

05:23.167 --> 05:26.622
You’re welcome. Thank you for that.

05:26.787 --> 05:28.823
All right, yinz have a great day.

05:28.857 --> 05:31.131
You, too. Thanks.

05:32.822 --> 05:34.563
More of these, hon.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.879
Geez, Bud, it ain’t even noon.

05:38.133 --> 05:40.237
Never too early to celebrate.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.809
Looks like they got the guy.

05:42.023 --> 05:43.653
Oh, the nutjob with the
tunnel under his house?

05:43.697 --> 05:44.865
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, my God.

05:44.986 --> 05:46.450
Do they know what the hell happened?

05:46.475 --> 05:47.576
May never know.

05:47.601 --> 05:49.603
But morale’s been kind of low, so...

05:49.723 --> 05:51.272
a little beer for the boys and that.

05:51.373 --> 05:53.407
That’s nice of you.

05:53.432 --> 05:54.766
I hope those boys appreciate you.

05:54.823 --> 05:57.368
- Aw, they never do.
- Yeah, I know.

05:57.980 --> 05:59.253
Have a good day, Bud.

05:59.278 --> 06:01.107
- You, too.
- All right.

06:01.156 --> 06:04.325
- Really?
- Look, I don’t have any ones.

06:04.485 --> 06:06.721
Hold on, wait. I got you.

06:14.483 --> 06:16.514
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

06:16.643 --> 06:19.612
Hey, look at that.

06:19.967 --> 06:21.709
Chelsea.

06:22.097 --> 06:23.898
- I’m joking.
- I know.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.571
But a 20’s a 20.

06:28.265 --> 06:29.883
All right, you enjoy your break.

06:29.917 --> 06:31.120
Thanks.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.027
Here you go.

07:35.176 --> 07:37.144
No, no, no, no. Don’t
lean your pits on em.

07:37.325 --> 07:38.864
You’re gonna rip your shoulders out.

07:38.972 --> 07:40.348
You got to, you got to
push down with your hands

07:40.372 --> 07:41.439
like that, all right?

07:41.641 --> 07:44.339
- Go for it. All right.
- Thanks.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.765
Hey, what are you doing here?

07:45.887 --> 07:48.089
Still can’t afford a razor, Chewy?

07:48.229 --> 07:50.052
You’ll never play for the
Yankees looking like that.

07:50.077 --> 07:52.045
What kind of asshole would
want to play for the Yankees?

07:52.073 --> 07:54.609
Officer Douglas, I’m Jake Noveer.

07:55.022 --> 07:57.525
I was a cop, and I don’t
like it when cops get shot.

07:57.632 --> 07:59.540
I want to let you know
I admire your bravery.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.451
You ever had the muffins
from this place?

08:01.545 --> 08:03.710
Thank you, Mr. Noveer,
that’s nice of you.

08:03.837 --> 08:05.458
Chewy, you put ’em in my room?

08:06.266 --> 08:08.107
Oh...

08:08.200 --> 08:10.436
Okay.

08:11.148 --> 08:13.201
- Thank you.
- Thanks, man.

08:15.602 --> 08:16.657
I thought you were gonna be alone.

08:16.681 --> 08:19.049
He dropped by. Supposed to be on duty.

08:19.227 --> 08:21.095
They get anything out of
the woman with Wilcox?

08:21.128 --> 08:22.605
She’s not talking.

08:23.074 --> 08:24.400
How are you keeping after?

08:24.471 --> 08:25.807
I’m okay. Thanks for asking.

08:26.066 --> 08:27.234
You still here?

08:27.549 --> 08:28.843
Nope.

08:29.150 --> 08:31.614
Okay, break time’s over, let’s go.

08:39.164 --> 08:42.279
Jake, how come you’re here?

08:42.884 --> 08:44.709
I had to see the doctor, and...

08:44.792 --> 08:46.626
Is everything all right?

08:46.793 --> 08:48.233
Yeah, routine shit.

08:48.275 --> 08:51.412
I also took the opportunity
to visit your rookie.

08:51.850 --> 08:53.076
She’s a brave one, huh?

08:53.101 --> 08:55.837
Yeah, she’s real smart.
Gonna be a good cop.

08:56.063 --> 08:57.809
You know her?

08:57.878 --> 09:00.315
Nah, tipping my hat, that’s all.

09:02.611 --> 09:04.746
Look, Peter, I just wanted to say, uh,

09:05.391 --> 09:09.611
long overdue, but I’m sorry for
calling you a racist fuck.

09:10.494 --> 09:13.368
Oh. Okay.

09:13.413 --> 09:14.916
Speaking of fucks,

09:14.982 --> 09:16.416
doesn’t seem like you’ve found anything

09:16.441 --> 09:18.002
to link Wilcox to the
Seven Bloods case.

09:18.039 --> 09:19.140
I see.

09:19.446 --> 09:21.315
See what?

09:21.500 --> 09:23.403
That’s why you apologized.

09:23.625 --> 09:24.805
Fuck off.

09:24.838 --> 09:26.220
No, I wasn’t pumping you.

09:26.293 --> 09:27.808
I knew Wilcox must be a dead end.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.802
You’d be on TV announcing
blood matches.

09:29.971 --> 09:32.380
So if, in your supreme genius,

09:32.446 --> 09:34.615
you know we got nothing, why ask?

09:34.714 --> 09:36.883
Peter, I’m a fuckin'
detective, that’s all I am.

09:37.163 --> 09:38.598
Even if I wasn’t working the case,

09:38.623 --> 09:40.329
I’d still want to know what was what.

09:40.408 --> 09:43.311
Well, we got nothing. Okay?

09:44.178 --> 09:47.604
Maybe Wilcox was involved,
but we can’t prove it.

09:47.689 --> 09:50.358
So, you’re right again.

09:50.558 --> 09:52.092
As always.

09:52.386 --> 09:54.296
Routine shit, huh?

10:12.187 --> 10:15.441
So... football...

10:16.258 --> 10:17.543
You mean playing it?

10:17.607 --> 10:22.110
No, no, I mean, maybe as a kid, but...

10:22.331 --> 10:24.473
these days, I just
watch from the couch.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.035
I mean, I work out, though.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.103
You know, I try to eat healthy.

10:28.233 --> 10:29.573
Right.

10:29.724 --> 10:31.473
Why, are you, uh, you athletic?

10:31.506 --> 10:32.841
What do you do for kicks?

10:33.142 --> 10:35.712
Oh... Don’t worry, I'm...

10:35.813 --> 10:37.366
I’m a pretty straight arrow, really.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.075
I’m sure a lot of guys
tell you that they want

10:39.099 --> 10:41.147
to settle down, and they
want to have a family,

10:41.217 --> 10:42.518
and I’m the real deal.

10:42.651 --> 10:44.595
Not to toot your own horn.

10:44.759 --> 10:46.828
Right?

10:48.758 --> 10:51.027
No, no, I’m... I’m a modest guy.

10:51.108 --> 10:52.522
Try to be.

10:54.281 --> 10:55.516
We’ll take the check.

10:55.730 --> 10:56.833
Dutch.

10:56.896 --> 10:58.143
No. No, no, no, no, no.

10:58.168 --> 10:59.802
No, I-I insist.

10:59.869 --> 11:02.930
Okay? I’m sorry that they
overcooked your steak.

11:03.581 --> 11:04.841
Hey, wait.

11:04.907 --> 11:06.276
You want to dine and dash?

11:06.402 --> 11:08.018
Have you ever done that?

11:09.255 --> 11:12.292
What, like... You mean, like,

11:12.317 --> 11:14.333
cut out without... without paying?

11:14.383 --> 11:15.553
Yeah.

11:15.686 --> 11:17.889
Come on, they-they deserve it, right?

11:17.914 --> 11:19.714
I mean, the food is shit.

11:19.763 --> 11:22.191
It’s not like the
service is any better.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.113
Uh, are you... I can’t tell,

11:24.138 --> 11:26.288
are you joking or...

11:27.515 --> 11:29.413
Yeah, I’m joking.

11:30.667 --> 11:31.800
Nice meeting you.

11:33.339 --> 11:34.704
Yeah.

11:43.039 --> 11:44.168
Dad?

11:44.193 --> 11:46.357
That’s what you want.
That’s what you want!

11:46.382 --> 11:47.581
Why do you make me?

11:47.606 --> 11:49.642
- Jesus Christ.
- Why do you make me? Why?!

11:51.260 --> 11:53.096
- Hey, hey. What’s going on?
- Oh, my God...

11:53.121 --> 11:54.321
Oh, thank God. You must be Chelsea.

11:54.346 --> 11:55.417
Yeah.

11:55.442 --> 11:57.678
I heard him from inside my house.

11:57.813 --> 11:59.120
Dad?

11:59.227 --> 12:01.345
Your mother fuckin’ walked out of here,

12:01.370 --> 12:02.479
like, five hours ago!

12:02.504 --> 12:04.878
Okay, well, Dad, she’s been
dead for five years, all right?

12:04.918 --> 12:06.984
We need to find her!

12:07.044 --> 12:08.171
Okay, is this normal?

12:08.204 --> 12:10.138
I mean, I don’t see him often, but...

12:10.172 --> 12:11.857
Yeah, that makes two of us.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.549
- Dad...
- We had...

12:13.649 --> 12:15.985
We had a fight. Oh, God.

12:16.032 --> 12:18.530
Cupcake, you need to.
You need to find her.

12:18.574 --> 12:20.010
Cupcake, you need to find her!

12:20.049 --> 12:21.504
Look, unless you need me to stay,

12:21.529 --> 12:22.584
I’m gonna go back inside.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.853
- No, thank you. Um...
- Oh, God.

12:24.887 --> 12:26.689
Thank you for finding his
phone and calling me.

12:26.723 --> 12:27.776
That-that was smart.

12:27.801 --> 12:29.063
Why?! What is it with me?

12:29.091 --> 12:30.851
I wouldn’t have known who to
call, but he kept saying,

12:30.875 --> 12:32.184
"Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea."

12:32.261 --> 12:33.932
Yeah, okay, yeah, I...

12:33.989 --> 12:35.523
- I feel pretty lucky.
- Why?

12:35.931 --> 12:38.166
Um, all right, I got it.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.310
- Thank you. All right.
- Damn it.

12:39.334 --> 12:40.450
Okay, Dad.

12:40.617 --> 12:42.305
Dad, let’s go back inside now.

12:42.425 --> 12:44.218
I’m gonna explain to you that you’re

12:44.301 --> 12:45.668
really upset about a woman you divorced

12:45.713 --> 12:47.048
fucking 20 years ago, come on.

12:47.243 --> 12:49.263
I can’t... Cupcake, why?

12:49.311 --> 12:51.012
Fucking bitch. Why?

12:51.113 --> 12:53.073
’Cause she's a bitch.

12:53.242 --> 12:55.415
- That.
- You want me to open that for you?

12:55.465 --> 12:57.499
I can open that. Here...

12:57.947 --> 12:59.490
Ooh,

12:59.515 --> 13:00.779
that’s my friend.

13:00.816 --> 13:02.886
Remember I told you my
friend wanted to meet you?

13:02.950 --> 13:04.050
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

13:04.075 --> 13:05.512
I’ll go get her.

13:06.168 --> 13:08.437
Stay right there. I’ll be right back.

13:11.126 --> 13:12.741
Hey.

13:17.239 --> 13:19.208
God, it’s worse than I thought.

13:19.242 --> 13:20.616
Shut up.

13:20.724 --> 13:22.292
Hi, Carrie. Hi.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.679
- I’m Dannie's better half.
- Yeah.

13:24.754 --> 13:27.021
I’m the one who makes
sure she dresses right.

13:27.095 --> 13:29.632
I, like, introduced her
to push-up bras and weed.

13:29.745 --> 13:31.151
Oh, okay. You know, we were

13:31.210 --> 13:34.147
just talking about
naptime, weren’t we, huh?

13:34.290 --> 13:35.565
Ooh, yeah.

13:35.590 --> 13:36.925
- Got to have that.
- Wait, what is that?

13:36.950 --> 13:38.395
It’s like her, uh, security blanket.

13:38.420 --> 13:39.540
What is this design?

13:39.565 --> 13:41.516
I wouldn’t have thought
Garrett would be so Kumbaya.

13:41.622 --> 13:42.724
Mommy.

13:42.766 --> 13:43.965
We’re going to bed.

13:43.999 --> 13:45.067
Come on.

13:46.168 --> 13:48.070
What do I do while
you’re putting her down?

13:48.335 --> 13:49.539
Just sit and wait.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.471
It’s old, but it’s not gonna hurt you.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.433
No...

13:55.334 --> 13:57.018
Shh. Shh.

14:03.820 --> 14:05.295
No.

14:06.823 --> 14:10.239
You got your blankey, you got your toy.

14:10.826 --> 14:12.353
Okay.

14:17.132 --> 14:18.738
Wow. That was fast.

14:18.815 --> 14:22.017
I’m good with her. Garret said so.

14:22.397 --> 14:23.699
Is this his room?

14:23.766 --> 14:25.234
Yeah.

14:31.980 --> 14:34.016
You think I’m gonna miss something?

14:37.344 --> 14:38.848
Is this the name change thing?

14:38.873 --> 14:40.007
Yeah.

14:40.399 --> 14:42.765
Why would h-he have done that?
Where’s her mom...?

14:42.790 --> 14:44.849
- What does he say?
- I can’t ask him.

14:44.874 --> 14:46.524
It’s too personal. I
need him to trust me.

14:46.549 --> 14:49.222
Dannie, I’m beginning to
think you’re more interested

14:49.247 --> 14:51.264
in replacing his wife than figuring out

14:51.298 --> 14:53.170
if maybe he murdered her.

14:53.335 --> 14:55.978
He didn’t murder his wife.
Are you insane?

14:56.051 --> 14:58.119
And then, what? Stab six
other people in the process

14:58.144 --> 14:59.351
so nobody would suspect?

14:59.401 --> 15:00.815
You’re missing the point.

15:00.963 --> 15:03.057
On purpose, I’d say.

15:04.727 --> 15:06.281
Why are you here?

15:31.349 --> 15:32.507
You on the wagon?

15:32.541 --> 15:34.027
I’m on all the wagons.

15:35.912 --> 15:37.305
You new here?

15:37.367 --> 15:38.711
I don’t think I've
seen you here before.

15:38.781 --> 15:40.449
Uh, no. I wish.

15:41.170 --> 15:42.538
Three years and counting.

15:42.877 --> 15:44.814
I can’t hold down a job
for three minutes.

15:44.954 --> 15:46.388
Well, they’re always hiring.

15:47.676 --> 15:50.279
Happy to make your
acquaintance, "Chelsea."

15:50.679 --> 15:51.960
So what, you’re having a party?

15:52.610 --> 15:53.698
I am.

15:53.723 --> 15:55.915
Puzzle race, in fact.

15:57.199 --> 15:59.167
Okay, what’s a puzzle race?

15:59.620 --> 16:02.657
Well... if you’re free tomorrow night,

16:03.283 --> 16:04.805
you should come find out.

16:17.798 --> 16:19.098
Here she is!

16:19.131 --> 16:20.797
Oh, my. Yeesh.

16:20.917 --> 16:23.246
Now we got to clap every
time you come to work, huh?

16:23.271 --> 16:26.408
Look at you. You’re
already walking so good, hon.

16:26.433 --> 16:28.233
Lucky he didn’t hit anything but fat.

16:28.258 --> 16:30.651
Fat? It’s all muscle, girl.

16:30.676 --> 16:32.870
- Eh, it’s fat.
- There’s our hero.

16:32.895 --> 16:34.718
Thanks for coming
in while you’re rehabbing.

16:34.772 --> 16:36.708
Uh, let’s talk in my office. Okay?

16:37.210 --> 16:38.327
You, too, Chewy.

16:38.352 --> 16:39.895
Huh? Okay.

16:40.820 --> 16:43.247
Okay, we’ve got no physical evidence

16:43.293 --> 16:45.508
to connect Wilcox to Seven Bloods.

16:45.616 --> 16:49.087
So I want you two to
press his girlfriend.

16:49.194 --> 16:50.257
You understand?

16:50.282 --> 16:51.449
Us?

16:52.242 --> 16:55.702
I-I mean, she-she’s not
gonna tell us anything.

16:55.794 --> 16:57.871
- We shot her boyfriend.
- Exactly.

16:58.574 --> 17:01.813
And, well, um, American
Forefront has provided her

17:01.838 --> 17:03.573
a fancy-pants attorney,

17:03.648 --> 17:05.876
Ben Durbin from Durbin and Green.

17:05.959 --> 17:08.185
Durbin’s gonna make
questioning her tough,

17:08.221 --> 17:12.121
so I’m hoping that you two can
provoke her into ignoring him.

17:12.421 --> 17:14.396
I don’t know if I should
go in there, Chief.

17:14.482 --> 17:16.924
I mean, I’m probably just gonna
rip that lawyer a new one.

17:16.955 --> 17:18.320
You know, part of the job.

17:18.488 --> 17:20.540
I just, I just don’t
want to fuck it up.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.054
Don’t you think you should go?

17:22.102 --> 17:23.817
And if you want someone else in there,

17:23.875 --> 17:25.242
you know, Rook’s the one who’s gonna

17:25.268 --> 17:27.170
push that nutjob over the edge.

17:28.336 --> 17:29.802
Okay.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.764
Rook, you ready?

17:31.790 --> 17:33.359
Let’s do it.

17:39.343 --> 17:41.994
Okay, I object to Officer
Douglas’s presence.

17:42.087 --> 17:43.340
On what basis?

17:43.408 --> 17:45.500
Well, it’s obviously intended
to provoke my client.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.781
Officer Douglas killed Ms.
Bailey’s boyfriend.

17:47.821 --> 17:49.730
Because Officer Douglas was a witness

17:49.755 --> 17:51.090
to what happened with your client,

17:51.302 --> 17:52.792
I’d say she's the best person to hear

17:52.826 --> 17:53.988
what Ms. Bailey has to say.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.570
Ms. Bailey has nothing to say.

17:55.595 --> 17:59.113
And unless she’s under
arrest, we’re leaving.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.080
Hmm. You know, that’s not a bad idea.

18:01.801 --> 18:03.221
I could arrest her,

18:03.302 --> 18:05.665
- as a material witness.
- To what?

18:05.718 --> 18:08.235
- Your officer murdering Mr. Wilcox?
- Mr. Wilcox

18:08.260 --> 18:10.703
was a person of interest in
the Seven Bloods murder case.

18:10.816 --> 18:13.972
"Seven Bloods."

18:14.939 --> 18:17.105
Uh, what’s the, what’s the joke here?

18:17.130 --> 18:19.127
My client and the late Mr.
Wilcox believe

18:19.152 --> 18:21.671
the Seven Bloods investigation
is nothing more than a pretext

18:21.714 --> 18:23.248
for violation of their civil rights,

18:23.276 --> 18:25.111
and the civil rights
of people like them.

18:25.224 --> 18:26.928
"People like them."

18:28.294 --> 18:30.128
Ms. Bailey and the late Mr. Wilcox

18:30.153 --> 18:31.757
belong to a group called
American Forefront.

18:31.782 --> 18:33.756
That’s a white supremacist group.

18:34.491 --> 18:35.585
Seven Bloods...

18:35.610 --> 18:38.047
never happened.

18:38.571 --> 18:40.473
It was a hoax.

18:41.326 --> 18:44.036
It was a-a hoax?

18:47.774 --> 18:49.249
Damn right.

18:51.952 --> 18:53.419
You’re free to leave.

18:53.606 --> 18:55.526
But don’t leave town.

19:15.614 --> 19:19.550
7/19. That’s the night of the Bloods.

19:30.115 --> 19:32.051
Website design.

19:41.093 --> 19:43.502
Paid a quarter million for this?

19:43.693 --> 19:46.200
Oh, man.

19:46.313 --> 19:49.615
You got burnt, bud. Shit is whack.

20:00.771 --> 20:02.708
Yeah.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.270
Okay. Uh-huh.

20:07.527 --> 20:09.529
Wait, Popsicles?

20:10.635 --> 20:12.797
Uh, no, it’s just, I already left.

20:14.967 --> 20:16.217
Okay.

20:16.328 --> 20:18.162
- Bye.
- Popsicles?

20:18.650 --> 20:20.794
It’s like you got an
eight-year-old at home like I do.

20:20.973 --> 20:22.942
Terri.

20:24.603 --> 20:26.064
Mm.

20:26.197 --> 20:27.749
Um...

20:28.834 --> 20:31.771
Yeah, believe it or
not, that was my dad.

20:33.171 --> 20:35.172
Second childhood?

20:35.454 --> 20:37.651
Yeah, like, bouncing back and forth?

20:37.991 --> 20:40.550
Yeah? Like, the other night,

20:40.606 --> 20:43.276
I thought he was
completely batshit senile.

20:44.067 --> 20:45.240
But then no, he’s...

20:45.289 --> 20:46.825
sounds like himself? I mean, himself,

20:46.850 --> 20:48.152
but desperate for a Popsicle.

20:48.186 --> 20:49.577
My father-in-law went through that.

20:49.602 --> 20:52.090
And now he’s just completely
gone, like, diapers.

20:52.132 --> 20:53.799
- No...
- Whole nine yards, yeah.

20:53.940 --> 20:55.995
Rick’s moms taking care of him at home.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.376
But you always liked them, right?

20:57.401 --> 20:59.271
- Oh, yeah. Still do.
- Mm.

20:59.449 --> 21:01.777
I mean, I don’t know how they
raised an asshole like that.

21:01.848 --> 21:03.492
- Oh, God. Why? What happened?
- Mm.

21:03.517 --> 21:05.117
- What?
- Fucker,

21:05.152 --> 21:08.954
he comes back into town,
and is like, "I love you."

21:08.989 --> 21:10.740
- Mm-hmm.
- "Let’s get back together."

21:10.816 --> 21:15.455
And then, like, five minutes
later, he’s gone. Again.

21:15.561 --> 21:18.177
And I mean, I wouldn’t
even care myself, but...

21:18.397 --> 21:21.233
fucking breaks Ricky’s
heart all over again.

21:21.896 --> 21:23.475
So what, he’s in Youngstown?

21:23.542 --> 21:27.963
Texas? Yeah, an oil job, apparently.

21:28.601 --> 21:30.536
- Good for Rick.
- Yeah.

21:30.741 --> 21:32.053
You know what? If I
were a better person,

21:32.077 --> 21:33.211
I’d feel the same way.

21:33.480 --> 21:35.088
Mm. Grab a beer?

21:36.267 --> 21:37.319
Yeah.

21:37.385 --> 21:38.691
Be right there.

21:38.716 --> 21:40.292
I got time for two.

21:40.958 --> 21:43.679
Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

21:43.789 --> 21:46.591
Oh, strawberry.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.904
Mango.

21:52.465 --> 21:54.306
Pineapple.

21:55.013 --> 21:59.519
Ah. I also love... lime...

21:59.638 --> 22:01.544
Yeah, I didn’t know
what flavor to get you.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.656
You’re looking lovely, cupcake.

22:04.030 --> 22:06.199
I missed you.

22:06.578 --> 22:08.263
I missed you, too, Dad.

22:10.803 --> 22:12.037
Is that what last night was about?

22:12.062 --> 22:13.831
You just wanted to get me over here?

22:14.354 --> 22:15.989
Last night?

22:16.491 --> 22:19.665
You were in your tighty-whities,
ranting about Mom.

22:23.156 --> 22:25.124
That would be funny.

22:25.204 --> 22:27.305
Well, that happened, Dad.

22:27.849 --> 22:29.549
You know, your neighbor called me.

22:29.941 --> 22:32.611
Your mother and I are on
very good terms these days.

22:32.910 --> 22:35.674
We used to fight, and I’m
sorry about that. Hmm?

22:35.930 --> 22:37.535
No, I’m good.

23:08.501 --> 23:10.848
Hey. You looking for me?

23:10.964 --> 23:13.599
- Uh, Michael Goodman?
- Yeah.

23:14.786 --> 23:16.656
Want to come in?

23:21.894 --> 23:23.188
You’re moving.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.558
Yeah. In, like, 20 minutes.

23:26.002 --> 23:27.562
You the new tenant?

23:27.821 --> 23:30.856
- Nah.
- Uh, you want a desk? Or a chair?

23:30.964 --> 23:32.447
Where you moving?

23:32.578 --> 23:34.036
Who are you?

23:34.112 --> 23:35.769
Sorry. Name’s John Smith.

23:35.842 --> 23:38.977
And please, no jokes about my
parents’ lack of imagination.

23:39.645 --> 23:42.506
I run a small company, and I was
hoping you could do my website.

23:42.581 --> 23:44.650
You, uh, you going out of business

23:44.675 --> 23:46.578
or just moving to finer pastures?

23:47.414 --> 23:49.549
Oh, uh, I’m getting out.

23:50.311 --> 23:52.585
Too much competition from
the comp sci students.

23:52.817 --> 23:55.201
Go to, um, any cafeteria
at Carnegie Mellon.

23:55.300 --> 23:57.261
You’ll find a dozen web
geniuses for cheap.

23:58.022 --> 23:59.204
Great.

24:33.039 --> 24:37.039
I am fine at home. I-It’s...

24:37.839 --> 24:40.105
Let’s just go take a look.

24:42.513 --> 24:44.069
You say I’m losing it.

24:44.181 --> 24:46.071
I’m as sharp as ever.
Ask me a question.

24:46.149 --> 24:47.449
Where’s Mom?

24:47.875 --> 24:49.086
Dead, of course.

24:49.111 --> 24:50.139
The bitch.

24:50.164 --> 24:52.866
You know, Dad, I just, I
can’t keep up with you.

24:52.984 --> 24:55.087
Uh, what? Keep up with what?

24:56.707 --> 24:59.819
Do you really not
remember the other night?

25:00.363 --> 25:02.821
You were yelling in your underwear?

25:02.934 --> 25:05.328
And then just last night,
you said that you and mom

25:05.361 --> 25:06.859
were on very good speaking terms.

25:07.385 --> 25:10.021
- I said that?
- Yeah.

25:13.141 --> 25:16.569
Look, I-I think we should just
go check them out, you know?

25:16.636 --> 25:18.724
Before you need it.

25:19.305 --> 25:21.673
You know, you have that
nest egg socked away.

25:21.873 --> 25:23.421
Damn it.

25:25.344 --> 25:28.046
This is a shitshow. I don’t need this.

25:31.252 --> 25:34.587
Thank God your Uncle Rich
isn’t alive to see this.

25:36.578 --> 25:38.361
What now?

25:40.760 --> 25:43.917
Rich, who’s not my uncle,
never was my uncle, right?

25:43.942 --> 25:45.144
Oh, God.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.369
He is alive, Dad.

25:46.985 --> 25:49.211
He lives in Upstate New York.

25:50.144 --> 25:52.545
You see, it’s just, you're not
remembering everything...

25:52.632 --> 25:54.947
I remember that.

26:09.681 --> 26:12.192
I can’t put my poor mother in here.

26:12.368 --> 26:14.194
Dad, this is for you, not Grandma.

26:14.334 --> 26:17.196
Me? This place is a prison.

26:17.230 --> 26:19.402
I know.

26:19.632 --> 26:20.902
Um...

26:20.979 --> 26:23.348
You know, we’re gonna let you know.

27:13.059 --> 27:14.958
It’s all about the
care that you receive

27:14.992 --> 27:17.130
and still feeling that
sense of independence.

27:17.464 --> 27:19.264
Love to show you the chapel.

27:19.351 --> 27:21.231
Wonderful services about

27:21.256 --> 27:24.032
different denominational
faiths and services.

27:24.057 --> 27:25.258
- Okay?
- Okay.

27:25.283 --> 27:26.772
- Right this way.
- Man.

27:26.807 --> 27:28.397
Now, if you like the enjoyment

27:28.422 --> 27:31.957
of having a convenience of
a bank, it’s right here.

27:32.330 --> 27:34.834
Over here, we have the grocery store.

27:34.934 --> 27:37.351
It’s kind of a little hot spot
in here in our community.

27:37.782 --> 27:39.353
And in here we have

27:39.568 --> 27:41.589
- our billiards room.
- Can you bet?

27:41.636 --> 27:43.873
That’s not something that we...

27:43.900 --> 27:46.026
- Not something really we encourage?
- ...we have here.

27:46.155 --> 27:48.060
But it is possible, uh, to come in here

27:48.095 --> 27:49.462
and enjoy a good night with the guys.

27:49.547 --> 27:51.475
Good, good.

27:51.731 --> 27:53.755
Thank you so much for coming.

27:53.780 --> 27:54.865
So nice to have you.

27:54.914 --> 27:56.771
Chelsea, thank you for taking the time.

27:56.796 --> 27:58.317
Appreciate it. Thank you.

28:01.509 --> 28:04.196
So? I mean, at least here
you’d have your own bathroom.

28:04.541 --> 28:07.135
I have my own bathroom at home.

28:12.431 --> 28:14.191
Welcome to the Kingswood Arms.

28:14.499 --> 28:16.482
Step right in here.

28:18.124 --> 28:19.572
Dad, you like this place?

28:19.910 --> 28:22.909
Not bad. Pretty nice, really.

28:23.587 --> 28:25.377
Wait, would you actually live here?

28:26.412 --> 28:30.283
I guess so. Sure. Yeah.

28:37.283 --> 28:41.080
So, uh, you know, we’re
still thinking about it.

28:41.105 --> 28:46.443
Um, it’s a big decision
and it’s hard on him.

28:46.566 --> 28:49.201
Smells good in here. I like it.

28:49.526 --> 28:52.904
Take your time. It’s
tough for you, too.

28:52.939 --> 28:54.385
It’s a tough moment.

28:54.410 --> 28:55.842
It’s a strong possible.

28:56.005 --> 28:57.309
The director will be right with us.

28:57.343 --> 28:59.357
Actually, you know,
can we wait on that?

28:59.511 --> 29:00.846
Um...

29:00.880 --> 29:02.675
I think we need to think

29:02.781 --> 29:04.266
and, uh...

29:04.789 --> 29:06.061
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

29:06.086 --> 29:07.662
We’ll call you. Let's go.

29:07.687 --> 29:08.987
So soon?

29:09.614 --> 29:10.722
Thank you.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.258
Possible.

29:13.552 --> 29:15.332
- Cupcake. Cupcake, look at this.
- Yeah?

29:15.357 --> 29:17.527
- Look at this.
- Yeah, Dad, I just saw the whole place.

30:22.753 --> 30:25.022
When did they say exactly...

30:25.136 --> 30:28.706
The same day. Same day.

30:38.817 --> 30:40.748
Yeah, she fell asleep
in, like, two seconds.

30:40.773 --> 30:42.948
We had a busy morning
at the park, so...

30:42.973 --> 30:44.692
- Did she eat a good lunch?
- Yeah.

30:44.717 --> 30:48.078
Um, sorry I can’t babysit
any other night this week.

30:48.103 --> 30:50.172
I have to do this thing
with my parents.

30:50.197 --> 30:52.800
Um, our, uh, our country club

30:52.825 --> 30:56.429
has this annual Regent’s
Dinner every summer, so...

30:56.864 --> 30:59.073
Is it, what’d you say, country club?

30:59.237 --> 31:02.849
I-It’s not, it's not a country club.

31:02.874 --> 31:06.778
It’s like a... a dinner...

31:06.986 --> 31:08.267
It’s a dinner club.

31:09.252 --> 31:11.344
You pay these crazy dues.

31:11.376 --> 31:13.479
It’s really expensive and, um...

31:13.890 --> 31:16.481
the food’s pretty terrible.

31:16.515 --> 31:20.518
Hey, well, if you want, um,
I could, like, tell you

31:20.553 --> 31:23.788
where to get terrible food
for, like, really cheap.

31:23.823 --> 31:25.924
Sure.

31:26.387 --> 31:28.827
It’s a dinner club. I mean...

31:29.299 --> 31:30.942
you really need this job?

31:31.069 --> 31:32.698
Going to college in the fall.

31:32.908 --> 31:35.169
I wanted a way to earn
some pocket change

31:35.194 --> 31:36.662
in a low-stress way.

31:36.868 --> 31:38.004
So, you have, like, any, like,

31:38.037 --> 31:39.805
younger brothers or sisters?

31:40.117 --> 31:42.107
No. Only child.

31:42.773 --> 31:44.491
How about you?

31:45.844 --> 31:48.647
Uh... I had a sister.

31:49.661 --> 31:51.083
She’s like five years older.

31:51.116 --> 31:53.041
But what do you mean
you "had" a sister?

31:53.112 --> 31:54.980
Uh, she’s gone now.

31:55.903 --> 31:58.543
She, like, ran off when I
was, like, a teenager.

31:59.091 --> 32:00.484
Sorry.

32:03.451 --> 32:07.298
Is-is that part of why you
had your drinking problem?

32:09.397 --> 32:11.236
Sorry. It’s rude.

32:11.307 --> 32:13.181
No, no, just thinking, uh...

32:13.667 --> 32:15.394
you got a good memory.

32:16.842 --> 32:18.404
I guess that’s what makes you

32:18.429 --> 32:20.078
so reliable, right?

32:20.991 --> 32:22.612
Yeah, maybe.

32:23.149 --> 32:27.591
I’m, like, I'm really glad
that you responded to my ad.

32:29.855 --> 32:31.529
Yeah, me, too.

32:32.797 --> 32:34.773
I should probably go.

32:35.405 --> 32:36.741
Yeah.

32:36.839 --> 32:38.775
I’ll-I'll see you later, though.

32:43.558 --> 32:45.805
You know, on our way
in, we saw they have, uh,

32:45.830 --> 32:47.978
they’re having the silent
auction again this year.

32:48.205 --> 32:50.058
- You bought something funny last year.
- I did.

32:50.145 --> 32:52.411
I did, in fact, win origami lessons.

32:53.465 --> 32:55.000
That’s right.

32:55.071 --> 32:56.234
And how’d they go?

32:56.274 --> 32:58.128
They gave me paper cuts.

32:58.175 --> 33:00.281
Dannie, you must be so
excited about school.

33:00.328 --> 33:01.381
I am.

33:01.406 --> 33:02.767
Yeah. I-I am,

33:02.792 --> 33:03.880
but it’s-it's weird.

33:03.905 --> 33:05.533
It suddenly seems really far away.

33:05.558 --> 33:07.300
On grad night I felt
like I was practically

33:07.325 --> 33:08.527
- leaving tomorrow.
- Here he is.

33:08.552 --> 33:09.633
Everybody, I want you to meet

33:09.658 --> 33:12.355
my new young hotshot, Tyler Bennett.

33:12.380 --> 33:13.535
Just graduated Pitt

33:13.560 --> 33:17.501
and he’s already been admitted
to the Harvard Business School.

33:17.761 --> 33:19.648
Harvard? That is impressive.

33:19.731 --> 33:20.833
Yeah.

33:21.013 --> 33:22.335
- Thank you.
- Congrats.

33:22.420 --> 33:23.858
Thank you.

33:25.331 --> 33:26.799
I did want to go to Harvard.

33:26.826 --> 33:28.179
I think we all probably did.

33:36.361 --> 33:38.042
Hey.

33:39.095 --> 33:41.180
Well, well, well.

33:42.023 --> 33:44.136
- She came.
- She did.

33:45.217 --> 33:47.650
It’s, uh, it's a really
beautiful place.

33:47.740 --> 33:49.541
More beautiful now that you’re here.

33:49.899 --> 33:51.053
Come on.

33:51.078 --> 33:52.861
What?

33:53.299 --> 33:55.633
So, you gonna tell me?
What’s a puzzle race?

33:57.703 --> 34:01.557
Okay. Everybody, let the games begin.

34:01.631 --> 34:03.352
Pick a card, any card.

34:03.668 --> 34:04.810
Card has a color.

34:04.835 --> 34:07.489
Color coincides with a table.

34:07.553 --> 34:09.130
And are we allowed to trade tables?

34:09.170 --> 34:10.768
Absolutely not.

34:10.793 --> 34:12.565
Sitting with strangers
is part of the fun.

34:12.591 --> 34:14.058
Get to know somebody new.

34:14.083 --> 34:16.252
So you like keeping people
on their toes, huh?

34:17.022 --> 34:20.158
What kind of party would it
be without a few surprises?

34:22.868 --> 34:25.838
Tables are downstairs.
See you there in five.

34:29.549 --> 34:32.484
Do you know what the puzzle’s
going to be? Do you know?

34:32.670 --> 34:34.728
Have you ever been to one
of his parties before?

34:34.754 --> 34:36.704
Nope. Told the wife
I’d give it one hour.

34:36.755 --> 34:38.377
- How about you?
- No, first time.

34:38.444 --> 34:39.976
Hopefully not the last.

34:40.018 --> 34:41.842
- What, you’re with us?
- Of course.

34:41.938 --> 34:43.255
I pulled yellow.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.081
So Randall’s a man of mystery.

34:45.203 --> 34:47.505
The last party, he had
us going door to door

34:47.531 --> 34:51.370
looking for pencil erasers
and hard-boiled eggs.

34:51.395 --> 34:53.335
- And Chivas.
- Oh, Chivas. How could I forget?

34:53.359 --> 34:55.253
You’d be surprised what a stranger

34:55.340 --> 34:57.483
will pour into your thimble
if you ask them nice enough.

34:58.856 --> 35:01.893
Okay. Everyone.

35:02.161 --> 35:06.692
For tonight’s game, please
look under your tables.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.075
Box under there. Take it out, please.

35:10.277 --> 35:12.110
It is a puzzle

35:12.271 --> 35:14.706
for the puzzle race.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.175
So, the first table

35:16.208 --> 35:17.722
to complete gets

35:17.753 --> 35:21.765
a $200 gift certificate to
the second-best restaurant

35:21.790 --> 35:22.947
in Pittsburgh.

35:22.981 --> 35:25.128
On your marks, get set, go!

35:25.204 --> 35:26.890
Oh, a one-color puzzle.

35:26.915 --> 35:27.996
You do not mess around.

35:28.021 --> 35:30.151
- I do not mess around.
- Okay.

35:32.045 --> 35:33.646
Counting on you three.

35:54.213 --> 35:56.750
Dad says can he have his phone back?

35:57.530 --> 35:59.138
You can use mine.

35:59.296 --> 36:03.416
That is very nice of you
to be his messenger.

36:03.441 --> 36:05.876
What is he gonna do when you’re gone?

36:06.164 --> 36:07.836
Mom.

36:08.259 --> 36:09.478
What?

36:10.295 --> 36:12.777
Dad’s talking to his work friends.

36:13.318 --> 36:15.065
I volunteered to come over here

36:15.090 --> 36:18.327
so I could get away from
that boring conversation.

36:18.564 --> 36:20.899
Yes, but I can show
you them properly tomorrow.

36:20.924 --> 36:22.725
Are you still keeping banker’s hours?

36:22.801 --> 36:26.071
Sure, how else am I gonna
keep my handicap down?

36:26.350 --> 36:28.287
Find me next week.
I-I’ll make some time.

36:28.312 --> 36:29.881
Oh, that’s-that's it. That’s perfect.

36:29.906 --> 36:32.975
You know what? I can show you a
prospectus online right now.

36:33.011 --> 36:35.848
No, I can’t. I'm not getting
any reception here.

36:35.873 --> 36:37.532
Uh, uh, follow me.

36:47.664 --> 36:49.612
- There you are.
- Mm.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.179
You look nice.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.495
Um...

37:00.650 --> 37:03.730
Are we supposed to pretend
like we didn’t hang out?

37:04.490 --> 37:08.359
Um, is... do you mind?

37:08.487 --> 37:11.303
- No, I-I, um...
- ’Cause I just, I didn’t want...

37:11.328 --> 37:12.605
I didn’t want your dad thinking

37:12.630 --> 37:14.132
that I was using him to get to you.

37:14.272 --> 37:17.531
It’s the last thing, uh, he’d think.

37:17.556 --> 37:19.658
He’s way too vain for that.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.657
Okay. Honestly, if you want,

37:21.682 --> 37:23.060
I’ll go clear it with him right now.

37:23.153 --> 37:26.070
You’d risk it for a summer fling?

37:26.756 --> 37:28.440
Yeah, why not?

37:30.925 --> 37:33.459
Don’t forget what I told you
the-the-the other night.

37:33.484 --> 37:34.787
I meant it.

37:38.068 --> 37:42.213
At least let me take
you out on a real date

37:42.306 --> 37:44.875
before you break my heart, okay?

37:49.739 --> 37:51.764
I’ll bring the bodyguard.

37:51.862 --> 37:53.404
It’s a deal.

37:58.809 --> 38:01.412
So, were you close?

38:01.499 --> 38:03.703
Or I don’t think I understand.

38:03.809 --> 38:05.863
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

38:06.132 --> 38:07.933
Spent my whole childhood with him.

38:08.486 --> 38:11.683
But... now that I spent
my whole adulthood

38:11.708 --> 38:13.396
trying to get away from him...

38:13.482 --> 38:14.796
Needed your distance.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.868
I understand that.

38:17.202 --> 38:19.172
Had the same thing with my dad.

38:19.791 --> 38:21.446
Mm-hmm.

38:23.345 --> 38:26.331
So, now’s the part where you
pull me away from the party

38:26.432 --> 38:28.827
and you... you’re gonna
get honest with me.

38:31.536 --> 38:32.739
What does that mean?

38:32.764 --> 38:34.565
Well...

38:35.239 --> 38:37.500
I mean, you’ve been posing all night.

38:37.642 --> 38:38.957
Posing?

38:39.069 --> 38:40.770
Yeah. For everyone.

38:41.858 --> 38:44.495
And this is part two.

38:44.697 --> 38:47.934
You know, the lights go down,
the soft music starts playing.

38:48.186 --> 38:49.834
I grew up with a liar.

38:49.888 --> 38:53.658
So I’m just done, you know, being...

38:54.238 --> 38:56.592
the prop or the mark.

38:59.951 --> 39:02.752
If you’re trying to scare me
away it’s not gonna work.

39:05.537 --> 39:08.672
I’m the guy that finds
cynicism attractive.

39:10.548 --> 39:13.050
Intelligence even more so.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.851
What are you gonna do?

39:19.530 --> 39:21.385
About what?

39:21.713 --> 39:23.381
About your dad.

39:25.636 --> 39:28.473
Mine... things got a lot easier

39:28.498 --> 39:31.204
and he was a whole lot happier

39:31.350 --> 39:33.532
after he went to the home.

39:34.488 --> 39:35.901
It’s just that, eventually,

39:36.014 --> 39:37.718
ready or not...

39:38.843 --> 39:40.278
like it or not,

39:40.982 --> 39:43.516
our parents become our children.

39:56.025 --> 39:57.278
You done creeping around

39:57.303 --> 39:58.625
other people’s windows for the night?

39:58.671 --> 40:00.450
Decided to creep on me?

40:00.645 --> 40:02.446
Pretty big operation for one person.

40:02.494 --> 40:04.240
Thought maybe you could use the help.

40:04.454 --> 40:05.798
You know how to bake?

40:05.871 --> 40:08.271
Nah, but if you tell me
what to do I can do it.

40:08.326 --> 40:09.828
You can take it easy.

40:09.894 --> 40:11.541
You probably had a long day.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.105
Well, I had a good day.

40:13.325 --> 40:14.539
Yeah?

40:15.747 --> 40:18.267
What’s a good day for a detective, hmm?

40:18.509 --> 40:21.764
You get pictures of
someone bird-dogging

40:21.789 --> 40:23.264
a lonesome housewife?

40:23.307 --> 40:24.986
Bird-dogging.

40:25.176 --> 40:27.078
So, where you from?

40:27.138 --> 40:28.450
Philly.

40:28.567 --> 40:30.000
But I moved around a lot.

40:30.109 --> 40:31.944
What brought you to Braden?

40:32.622 --> 40:34.392
I don’t know. Uh...

40:34.850 --> 40:37.013
Some days I think this
place is about to die,

40:37.038 --> 40:39.507
but... other days I think

40:39.664 --> 40:42.403
something is really
about to happen here.

40:42.573 --> 40:44.707
So why’d you pick the dead part?

40:44.732 --> 40:47.634
Either way, people need baked goods,

40:47.745 --> 40:49.714
no matter the economy.

40:49.739 --> 40:51.371
You ought to let me take
you around sometime,

40:51.396 --> 40:53.432
over to where the other half lives.

40:53.859 --> 40:55.099
Oh, yeah?

40:55.146 --> 40:57.148
You know how the other half lives?

40:57.736 --> 40:59.330
Well, not really, but...

40:59.873 --> 41:02.221
I hear you can drive there from here.

41:32.367 --> 41:35.344
The mystery order is back, baby.
It’s back!

41:37.900 --> 41:40.247
It’s back.

41:47.931 --> 41:49.424
Hey, Dad?

41:50.592 --> 41:52.393
Go away, go away.

41:52.734 --> 41:54.035
Hey, Dad, where are you?

41:54.109 --> 41:55.578
Go-go away!

41:58.154 --> 41:59.800
Dad, are you in here?

42:02.371 --> 42:03.972
Oh, God.

42:05.834 --> 42:07.903
I’m sorry, I'm sorry.

42:08.861 --> 42:10.161
I don’t know...

42:10.186 --> 42:12.204
Why don’t you go get
yourself cleaned up.

42:12.268 --> 42:14.257
What hap... what happened?

42:14.410 --> 42:16.841
Just go get yourself cleaned up, and...

42:16.945 --> 42:18.831
Have Popsicles?

42:19.209 --> 42:20.709
No.

42:23.132 --> 42:24.742
I’m-I'm sorry.

42:25.101 --> 42:26.768
I’m sorry, I'm sorry.

42:26.982 --> 42:28.475
I don’t...

42:29.625 --> 42:32.327
What happened? What happened?

42:49.211 --> 42:50.762
All right.

42:51.634 --> 42:53.752
Well, this isn’t so bad, right, Dad?

42:54.503 --> 42:56.271
I think you’ll grow to like it here.

42:56.296 --> 42:58.544
Eh, easy for you to say.

43:01.991 --> 43:03.809
Getting settled okay?

43:04.163 --> 43:05.343
Who are you?

43:05.407 --> 43:06.709
Hi, Mr. Wyler, I’m Paloma.

43:06.895 --> 43:08.251
You remember, Dad, we met her

43:08.276 --> 43:09.944
during the tour.

43:10.118 --> 43:12.256
Just came by to drop off my card.

43:13.109 --> 43:15.874
Anything comes up, or you just
want to know how he’s doing,

43:15.904 --> 43:18.506
- feel free to call.
- Okay, cool. Thank you.

43:19.842 --> 43:22.043
Is she the teacher?

43:22.145 --> 43:24.886
Uh, no, Dad, she’s, um...

43:25.476 --> 43:27.069
Well, sort of, yeah.

43:27.094 --> 43:28.829
She’s sort of a teacher.

43:29.384 --> 43:31.353
She’s someone that you
can ask for help.

43:31.632 --> 43:32.868
She seems nice.

43:32.981 --> 43:34.321
Yeah, I’m sure she is.

43:34.372 --> 43:36.408
No, put it... No, no.
Put-put it over there,

43:36.433 --> 43:38.735
so I can see it while I watch the TV.

43:40.259 --> 43:42.009
And I’m gonna need some new aftershave.

43:42.034 --> 43:44.242
Wasn’t enough in the bottle at home,

43:44.267 --> 43:46.077
didn’t even bother packing it.

43:47.323 --> 43:48.961
Yeah, I will get you some.

43:49.011 --> 43:50.913
Thanks for your help, cupcake.

43:53.374 --> 43:56.070
Yeah, Dad, we need to talk.

43:56.276 --> 43:57.847
What, cupcake?

44:00.249 --> 44:01.929
Growing up for me...

44:02.105 --> 44:03.873
was hard.

44:04.287 --> 44:06.262
Growing up with you, I mean.

44:07.035 --> 44:09.238
You always made it seem
like it was so much fun,

44:09.263 --> 44:10.859
You know, what a life.

44:12.155 --> 44:14.360
But, uh, it wasn’t fun.

44:14.697 --> 44:16.017
It sucked.

44:16.799 --> 44:18.421
And...

44:20.922 --> 44:23.826
Yeah, I’m just... I’m
mad at you about it.

44:23.926 --> 44:25.987
You know, I’m still mad about it.

44:26.335 --> 44:27.858
Cupcake, I’m so sorry.

44:27.957 --> 44:31.790
I... I never meant to hurt you.

44:31.968 --> 44:33.778
I love you.

44:37.051 --> 44:39.188
Yeah, it’s just, like...

44:41.075 --> 44:43.362
You know, you’ve always said that.

44:44.419 --> 44:46.072
And, I don’t know,

44:46.097 --> 44:48.727
how am I supposed to
know that that’s true

44:48.918 --> 44:51.309
when everything else has been a lie?

45:03.707 --> 45:06.526
I’ve-I've loved... you

45:06.910 --> 45:10.946
since the first minute
I saw you, since...

45:11.519 --> 45:12.770
you first looked at me

45:12.795 --> 45:15.737
through these barely-opened eyes.

45:16.205 --> 45:20.594
I might’ve been creative about ways

45:20.619 --> 45:22.989
to support you and feed you.

45:23.740 --> 45:26.019
I might not have always
wanted you to know

45:26.079 --> 45:27.499
what I was up to,

45:27.528 --> 45:29.143
but I loved you.

45:33.802 --> 45:36.483
Chelsea, I’ve always loved you.

45:38.613 --> 45:40.317
I love you.

45:43.164 --> 45:45.566
Yeah, I love you, too, Dad.

45:48.990 --> 45:50.893
What if, um...

45:51.160 --> 45:53.162
Yeah, what if we had, like, a...

45:54.237 --> 45:55.764
like, a standing date, you know?

45:55.798 --> 45:58.305
Um, lunch every Saturday.

45:59.309 --> 46:01.977
That would be wonderful.

46:02.793 --> 46:04.966
You want to see if

46:05.059 --> 46:07.187
your mother would like to join us?

46:07.212 --> 46:08.977
I’m not mad at her anymore.

46:11.547 --> 46:13.535
Yeah, that’s a great idea.

46:14.510 --> 46:16.469
I’ll call her.

46:18.592 --> 46:19.927
Okay.

46:24.445 --> 46:25.754
God, you’re a good girl,

46:25.779 --> 46:27.395
Miss Cupcake.

46:29.511 --> 46:31.313
Thanks, Dad.

46:57.446 --> 46:59.415
Rich.

46:59.614 --> 47:02.692
I had to shit myself to
get here, but I’m in.

47:04.165 --> 47:05.821
Okay.

47:22.825 --> 47:24.327
Hi.

47:24.402 --> 47:26.270
Okay time to stop by?

47:26.777 --> 47:28.078
What are you doing here?

47:31.464 --> 47:34.111
I’ve been thinking about
the last few days, and...

47:35.425 --> 47:38.360
maybe it’s time I finally
met my granddaughter.

47:43.269 --> 47:45.615
Are you fucking... are you joking?

47:48.563 --> 47:50.963
I mean, that-that’s... that’s
not fucking happening.

47:51.016 --> 47:53.222
Look, I know. I’m sorry,

47:53.536 --> 47:55.232
but you are my son, she
is my granddaughter.

47:55.266 --> 47:57.799
What the f... what are
you talking about, man?

47:58.102 --> 48:00.756
Three years, you-you, uh,
you barely talk to me,

48:00.797 --> 48:02.699
and-and now, we’re...

48:02.971 --> 48:04.443
We’re, what? Were, like,
we’re, like, family?

48:04.467 --> 48:06.531
I know I fucked up on that.

48:07.344 --> 48:09.080
There’s so much

48:09.112 --> 48:10.688
to be sorry for. It’s...

48:12.251 --> 48:14.321
I should’ve reached out when
your mom first told me.

48:14.346 --> 48:15.819
I-I should’ve reached
out when she was...

48:15.853 --> 48:18.288
When she was, what... alive?

48:19.110 --> 48:22.025
No, of course, y-you couldn’t
be seen fucking your employee.

48:22.058 --> 48:23.431
No, that was...

48:23.521 --> 48:25.455
No, your mom wanted to keep it quiet.

48:25.530 --> 48:27.731
Yeah, all right, I get it,
but now that you fucked up,

48:28.065 --> 48:30.451
what? It’s-it's okay to,
like, bring me in now?

48:31.945 --> 48:34.583
I want to help you take care of Carrie.
Yinz let me do that.

48:34.643 --> 48:36.712
You let me do that.

48:37.032 --> 48:39.441
She won’t miss the chances you did.

48:40.111 --> 48:41.439
That’s all.

48:43.834 --> 48:46.003
You know, um...

48:47.036 --> 48:50.005
the first time that
you ever called me...

48:52.418 --> 48:54.895
...like, the-the first
time that you, uh,

48:55.646 --> 48:59.016
you ever called me was to
drag me into the-the, uh,

48:59.069 --> 49:00.873
the worst experience...

49:03.557 --> 49:05.935
You know, I got to, like...

49:07.036 --> 49:09.774
I got to, like-like,
live with that shit

49:10.959 --> 49:13.128
the rest of my life.

49:19.088 --> 49:21.990
What are you doing here, man?

49:25.744 --> 49:27.049
No-no... You-y... I-I...

49:27.129 --> 49:28.958
You-you will never,

49:28.993 --> 49:31.898
ever have a relationship
with my daughter.

49:36.441 --> 49:40.293
You... think you know me.

49:41.570 --> 49:44.408
You think you know
everything, don’t you?

49:44.625 --> 49:46.944
You think you can judge me.

49:48.278 --> 49:50.188
Look around you.

49:50.955 --> 49:52.922
There’s not a house on this street

49:53.016 --> 49:54.332
that wasn’t built by someone

49:54.357 --> 49:56.821
who worked for our family, my family.

49:57.183 --> 50:00.290
I’ve had to carry this street.
I’ve had to carry this town.

50:00.324 --> 50:02.893
Hey, man, can you just
shut the fuck up?

50:03.104 --> 50:04.819
Look at my eyes,

50:04.922 --> 50:08.029
and-and listen to what
I’m saying, okay?

50:09.363 --> 50:10.903
Look, y-you might carry

50:10.928 --> 50:13.048
this whole fucking town,

50:14.154 --> 50:16.020
but you do not own this yard,

50:16.066 --> 50:18.808
so get the <i>fuck off of it.</i>

50:48.339 --> 50:49.339
<i>So what is this, like,</i>

50:49.370 --> 50:51.419
<i>front-row seats to a steel mill?</i>

50:51.466 --> 50:52.602
<i>Absolutely.</i>

50:52.783 --> 50:54.383
They work, we eat.

50:58.914 --> 51:01.383
You know, about my dad,
you really helped me.

51:01.583 --> 51:03.318
I’m glad.

51:03.690 --> 51:06.461
He told me that there’s, uh,
a lovely widow at the home

51:06.486 --> 51:08.020
- that he’s enjoying getting to know.
- Widow.

51:08.090 --> 51:09.391
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh.

51:09.976 --> 51:11.520
- Yeah.
- It’s wonderful.

51:12.386 --> 51:14.175
Meeting somebody new.

51:14.495 --> 51:15.845
Was it ice cream?

51:15.870 --> 51:18.375
- Was it... gelatin?
- Uh...

51:18.400 --> 51:20.759
You know, I don’t think I’m
qualified to even know.

51:20.784 --> 51:22.820
I think that qualifies as a cake.

51:22.899 --> 51:25.133
- I don’t think so.
- You don’t think so?

51:25.213 --> 51:27.282
No.

51:30.193 --> 51:31.661
See something you like?

51:31.719 --> 51:35.656
This beautiful Mario
Soprani is from 1908.

51:36.130 --> 51:38.505
Uh, the case is a little
scuffed-up, but, uh...

51:39.601 --> 51:40.936
You want to try it out?

51:41.004 --> 51:43.205
Me? No.

51:43.346 --> 51:47.016
I don’t really play anymore.
Gave it up.

51:47.687 --> 51:48.947
It’s for the lady.

51:48.972 --> 51:51.175
Oh, and the lady can’t afford it, so...

51:51.333 --> 51:55.270
The lady should try it out anyway.

51:55.371 --> 51:57.290
You like it?

51:57.358 --> 51:58.788
I do.

51:59.174 --> 52:01.643
Reminds me of my childhood.

52:01.738 --> 52:04.509
- She grew up in the circus.
- Mm, very close.

52:04.714 --> 52:06.181
- Take it.
- Wait a minute.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.953
What are you doing? You’re crazy.

52:09.518 --> 52:12.688
- Crazy would be buying all five.
- Mm-hmm.

52:20.068 --> 52:21.537
Chelsea.

52:21.870 --> 52:23.215
Hey.

52:25.394 --> 52:27.862
What? I’m sorry.

52:46.408 --> 52:49.239
I think this is moving a little fast.

52:52.066 --> 52:54.490
Aren’t there just people in life...

52:57.585 --> 52:59.520
...whom you recognize?

53:02.030 --> 53:03.965
Yeah, I guess you’re right.

53:07.128 --> 53:08.395
I guess there are.
