WEBVTT

00:09.005 --> 00:09.021
 Lemonis: HI, THERE I'M MARCUS.

00:10.022 --> 00:12.007
TONIGHT ON "THE PROFIT"...

00:12.009 --> 00:14.000
	WE HEAD BACK TO

00:12.009 --> 00:14.000
			SOME OF THE BUSINESS

00:14.002 --> 00:16.004
			I'VE PARTNERED WITH

00:14.002 --> 00:16.004
			OVER THE PAST YEAR.

00:16.006 --> 00:17.013
	-CAROLYN?

00:16.006 --> 00:17.013
	-Carolyn: I'M CAROLYN.

00:17.013 --> 00:19.004
		-NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:17.013 --> 00:19.004
		-Lemonis: WHEN I MAKE A DEAL,

00:19.006 --> 00:21.013
		I COME IN WITH A PLAN

00:19.006 --> 00:21.013
			AND A CHECK.

00:21.015 --> 00:22.021
	Man: THANK YOU, MARCUS.

00:22.021 --> 00:24.004
			Woman: I WAS GONNA WORK YOU

00:22.021 --> 00:24.004
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

00:24.004 --> 00:25.009
		Lemonis: [ CHUCKLES ]

00:25.010 --> 00:27.016
	BUT WHAT HAPPENS

00:25.010 --> 00:27.016
		AFTER THE CAMERAS SHUT DOWN...

00:27.018 --> 00:30.018
Michael: I'VE LET IT SLIDE

00:27.018 --> 00:30.018
FOR THREE FREAKIN' YEARS!

00:30.018 --> 00:32.009
		Lemonis: ...MAY SURPRISE YOU.

00:32.011 --> 00:35.018
		ONE STRUGGLING

00:32.011 --> 00:35.018
		NOVELTY SPORTING GOOD COMPANY

00:35.020 --> 00:37.024
		HAS BEEN TOTALLY TRANSFORMED.

00:37.024 --> 00:39.021
			WOW.

00:37.024 --> 00:39.021
			LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

00:41.003 --> 00:42.008
		BUT THE OWNER IS STILL MAKING

00:42.009 --> 00:44.027
		THE SAME SORT

00:42.009 --> 00:44.027
OF SHORT-SIGHTED DECISIONS

00:44.029 --> 00:47.003
	THAT NEARLY BROUGHT THEM

00:44.029 --> 00:47.003
		TO THE BRINK.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.017
I'M PISSED THAT YOU BOUGHT

00:47.003 --> 00:48.017
			THE PRINTER.

00:48.018 --> 00:50.002
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

00:50.003 --> 00:52.023
		IF YOU WERE ME, WOULD YOU STOP

00:50.003 --> 00:52.023
	PUTTING MONEY IN THIS BUSINESS?

00:54.003 --> 00:56.009
		AT UNIQUE SPA IN LONG ISLAND,

00:56.009 --> 01:00.005
		WE DID A FULL-ON RENOVATION

00:56.009 --> 01:00.005
AND LAUNCHED A NEW PRODUCT LINE.

01:00.006 --> 01:01.012
	BUT THE OWNER...

01:01.012 --> 01:03.012
	Carolyn: YOU ALMOST PUT

01:01.012 --> 01:03.012
MY FAMILY OUT OF A HOUSE.

01:03.014 --> 01:04.019
Man: I DON'T CARE.

01:04.019 --> 01:07.028
		Lemonis: ...STILL ISN'T TAKING

01:04.019 --> 01:07.028
		HER PAYCHECK.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.022
		BUT NO MATTER

01:08.000 --> 01:09.022
			HOW MUCH YOU INVEST

01:09.022 --> 01:11.022
			OR HOW GOOD

01:09.022 --> 01:11.022
	YOUR INTENTIONS MAY BE,

01:11.024 --> 01:15.016
SOMETIMES DEALS FALL APART

01:11.024 --> 01:15.016
AND PARTNERSHIPS GO SOUTH.

01:15.018 --> 01:19.010
Sal: I NEVER DID ANYTHING TO TRY

01:15.018 --> 01:19.010
	TO BREAK THIS DEAL WHATSOEVER.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.022
			Michael: WHERE'S MY MONEY?!

01:20.024 --> 01:21.027
	Gina: I'LL END YOU, BRO.

01:21.027 --> 01:23.019
			Michael: I HAVEN'T BEEN PAID

01:21.027 --> 01:23.019
	FOR THREE YEARS!

01:23.021 --> 01:25.015
	Lemonis:

01:23.021 --> 01:25.015
TONIGHT, ON "THE PROFIT,"

01:25.016 --> 01:26.021
A PROGRESS REPORT.

01:26.022 --> 01:28.009
	Michael:

01:26.022 --> 01:28.009
			I'M CLOSING YOU DOWN FIRST!

01:36.009 --> 01:38.003
	Lemonis:

01:36.009 --> 01:38.003
MY NAME IS MARCUS LEMONIS,

01:38.003 --> 01:41.006
			AND OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS,

01:38.003 --> 01:41.006
			I'VE INTRODUCED YOU

01:41.007 --> 01:44.021
		TO 23 SMALL BUSINESSES

01:41.007 --> 01:44.021
		ACROSS THIS COUNTRY...

01:44.021 --> 01:45.026
	OKAY, LET'S GO TO WORK.

01:45.027 --> 01:47.009
		...MOST OF THEM STRUGGLING...

01:47.009 --> 01:48.019
YOU'VE GOT TO TRUST THE PROCESS.

01:48.020 --> 01:51.019
	...SOME JUST WEEKS AWAY

01:48.020 --> 01:51.019
			FROM CLOSING THEIR DOORS...

01:51.020 --> 01:53.021
			CUT YOUR LOSSES AND GO HOME.

01:53.021 --> 01:56.019
...BUT ALL OF THEM LOOKING

01:53.021 --> 01:56.019
		FOR ANSWERS AND HELP.

01:56.020 --> 01:58.028
	Woman: WE CERTAINLY NEED

01:56.020 --> 01:58.028
	YOUR BUSINESS EXPERTISE.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.015
	Man: ABSOLUTELY -- 100%.

02:00.016 --> 02:01.018
	Lemonis: I'VE MADE DEALS

02:01.019 --> 02:03.001
			WITH A CANDY COMPANY

02:01.019 --> 02:03.001
IN JACKSONVILLE...

02:03.003 --> 02:04.007
			I DIDN'T REALLY GET

02:03.003 --> 02:04.007
		A GOOD TASTE.

02:04.007 --> 02:05.007
			I NEED ANOTHER ONE.

02:05.009 --> 02:07.010
			...A FAMILY BARBECUE

02:05.009 --> 02:07.010
SOUTH CAROLINA...

02:07.012 --> 02:09.008
THESE RIBS ARE RIDICULOUS.

02:09.008 --> 02:11.019
		...A NATIONAL CLOTHING COMPANY

02:09.008 --> 02:11.019
BASED IN NEW YORK CITY...

02:11.020 --> 02:12.019
			Woman: WOW.

02:12.020 --> 02:14.008
	I MEAN, I'M BLOWN AWAY.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.008
Lemonis: ...AN ICE CREAM COMPANY

02:14.009 --> 02:16.008
IN NEW JERSEY...

02:16.009 --> 02:17.024
	-THAT GREEN TEA'S GOOD.

02:16.009 --> 02:17.024
	-Woman: ISN'T IT GOOD?

02:17.025 --> 02:19.028
Lemonis: ...AND A USED CAR

02:17.025 --> 02:19.028
			BUSINESS IN CHICAGO.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.014
WHOO-HOO!

02:20.000 --> 02:21.014
			LIQUIDATION.

02:21.014 --> 02:24.021
		WHEN I GET INVOLVED,

02:21.014 --> 02:24.021
I INVEST MY TIME AND MY MONEY...

02:24.021 --> 02:26.003
			I'M 100% IN CHARGE.

02:26.004 --> 02:31.000
	...CLOSE TO $23 MILLION SO FAR

02:26.004 --> 02:31.000
FOR A STAKE IN THOSE BUSINESSES.

02:31.001 --> 02:34.009
	I'M NOT A CONSULTANT,

02:31.001 --> 02:34.009
AND I'M NOT THE FAIRY GODMOTHER.

02:34.009 --> 02:37.020
		MY GOAL -- SAVE JOBS,

02:34.009 --> 02:37.020
KEEP DREAMS ALIVE,

02:37.021 --> 02:38.028
	AND OF COURSE...

02:39.000 --> 02:40.009
			-Scott: WE GOT A DEAL.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.009
			-Lemonis: ...MAKE A PROFIT.

02:40.009 --> 02:42.009
I'M GONNA BECOME AN OWNER

02:40.009 --> 02:42.009
IN THIS BUSINESS,

02:42.009 --> 02:43.026
	AND A LOT OF THINGS ARE

02:42.009 --> 02:43.026
		GONNA CHANGE.

02:43.027 --> 02:46.009
			ONCE THE SHOWS HAVE

02:43.027 --> 02:46.009
			BEEN SHOT AND AIRED,

02:46.009 --> 02:48.026
MY WORK IS OFTEN JUST BEGINNING.

02:53.002 --> 02:55.028
	LAST YEAR, I MADE A DEAL

02:53.002 --> 02:55.028
	WITH COOPERSBURG SPORTS,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.018
A SPORTS NOVELTY BUSINESS

02:56.000 --> 02:59.018
	LOCATED IN PENNSYLVANIA.

02:59.019 --> 03:02.025
		THIS IS A FAMILY BUSINESS RUN

02:59.019 --> 03:02.025
		BY SCOTT PINO

03:02.026 --> 03:05.015
		ALONG WITH HIS SON BEN

03:02.026 --> 03:05.015
	AND HIS DAUGHTER JACKIE.

03:05.016 --> 03:06.022
			Jackie: DAD!

03:06.024 --> 03:09.000
			Scott: I CAN'T FIND

03:06.024 --> 03:09.000
THE YANKEE ORDER OUT HERE.

03:09.001 --> 03:13.001
		Lemonis: THEIR BIG SELLER HAD

03:09.001 --> 03:13.001
	ALWAYS BEEN THESE NOVELTY BATS.

03:13.002 --> 03:16.025
		AT ONE TIME, THEY WERE

03:13.002 --> 03:16.025
	IN EVERY MAJOR LEAGUE BALLPARK.

03:16.026 --> 03:19.025
		UP UNTIL JUST THREE YEARS AGO,

03:16.026 --> 03:19.025
	THEY WERE BRINGING NORTH

03:19.026 --> 03:22.012
OF $3 MILLION A YEAR IN REVENUE,

03:22.013 --> 03:24.020
AND THE PINOS WERE

03:22.013 --> 03:24.020
	A SUCCESS STORY.

03:24.021 --> 03:26.002
		Scott:

03:24.021 --> 03:26.002
	THAT'S THE LOS ANGELES DODGERS,

03:26.002 --> 03:27.028
		THE NEW YORK YANKEES.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.026
Lemonis: BUT THEN,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.026
THE COMPETITION GOT TOUGH.

03:30.026 --> 03:33.026
Scott: A MAJOR COMPETITOR

03:30.026 --> 03:33.026
			WHO'S REALLY STOLEN

03:33.026 --> 03:34.027
		A LOT OF OUR BUSINESS.

03:34.028 --> 03:36.002
	Lemonis:

03:34.028 --> 03:36.002
			WHO'S THE MAJOR COMPETITOR?

03:36.003 --> 03:37.010
Scott: LOUISVILLE SLUGGER.

03:37.012 --> 03:39.020
			Lemonis: AFTER YEARS

03:37.012 --> 03:39.020
			OF STABILITY AND PROSPERITY,

03:39.021 --> 03:41.025
THE BUSINESS WENT

03:39.021 --> 03:41.025
	INTO FREE FALL.

03:41.026 --> 03:43.026
	HOW MUCH DEBT IS

03:41.026 --> 03:43.026
		ON THE COMPANY TODAY?

03:43.027 --> 03:45.019
		Scott: I HAVE ABOUT $700,000.

03:45.020 --> 03:47.014
	MY LIFE SAVINGS -- GONE.

03:47.015 --> 03:51.004
	Lemonis: WHEN I MET THE FAMILY,

03:47.015 --> 03:51.004
			THEIR REVENUE WAS DOWN 50%.

03:51.006 --> 03:54.028
THEY HAD RACKED UP

03:51.006 --> 03:54.028
	ALMOST $700,000 OF DEBT.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.024
		COOPERSBURG SPORTS WAS

03:55.000 --> 03:57.024
	IN REAL TROUBLE.

04:00.006 --> 04:02.002
		Jackie: HOW DID WE NOT REALIZE

04:00.006 --> 04:02.002
		THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE

04:02.003 --> 04:03.016
	ENOUGH BOXES TO FULFILL

04:02.003 --> 04:03.016
THE ORDER?

04:03.018 --> 04:04.014
Lemonis: HOW MANY ARE YOU SHORT?

04:04.014 --> 04:06.006
			Jackie: ABOUT 1,200.

04:06.007 --> 04:08.019
Scott: OUR SYSTEM DOESN'T

04:06.007 --> 04:08.019
			MANAGE THAT.

04:08.020 --> 04:09.019
		Lemonis: WHAT SYSTEM?

04:09.020 --> 04:10.027
		THE BUSINESS HAD SOME PROBLEMS

04:10.028 --> 04:13.006
			THAT HAD TO BE FIXED

04:10.028 --> 04:13.006
			IMMEDIATELY.

04:13.007 --> 04:15.020
THE WAREHOUSE WAS

04:13.007 --> 04:15.020
			A DISORGANIZED MESS.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.000
	Ben: THERE'S NOT A FLOW.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.014
			WITHOUT HAVING SPACE

04:17.000 --> 04:19.014
	TO STORE THINGS,

04:19.014 --> 04:21.014
		YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE STEPPING

04:19.014 --> 04:21.014
			OVER STUFF.

04:21.016 --> 04:23.011
			Lemonis: AND THEY WERE GONNA

04:21.016 --> 04:23.011
		HAVE TO EXPAND

04:23.012 --> 04:26.000
THEIR PRODUCT LINE -- SOMETHING

04:23.012 --> 04:26.000
SCOTT'S KIDS ALREADY UNDERSTOOD.

04:26.002 --> 04:28.002
		Jackie: YOU GUYS WANT

04:26.002 --> 04:28.002
TO TALK ABOUT NEW PRODUCTS

04:28.002 --> 04:29.011
		THAT WE WANT TO COME UP WITH?

04:29.012 --> 04:31.011
	-Lemonis: YEAH.

04:29.012 --> 04:31.011
	-Jackie: I MEAN, IT'S THE POINT

04:31.012 --> 04:33.000
-HERE THAT WE'RE KIND OF LIKE...

04:31.012 --> 04:33.000
-Lemonis: YES, PLEASE.

04:33.002 --> 04:34.021
Jackie: ...WANTING TO GET

04:33.002 --> 04:34.021
			AWAY FROM THE BATS?

04:34.021 --> 04:35.028
Scott: I DON'T WANT MARCUS

04:34.021 --> 04:35.028
TO TAKE HIS FOCUS

04:35.028 --> 04:37.024
	OFF THE BATS RIGHT NOW.

04:37.024 --> 04:40.014
			Lemonis: BUT IT WAS

04:37.024 --> 04:40.014
	SCOTT'S RESISTANCE TO NEW IDEAS

04:40.016 --> 04:43.009
		THAT WAS THE COMPANY'S

04:40.016 --> 04:43.009
BIGGEST LIABILITY.

04:43.009 --> 04:45.028
	FOR YOU TO HAVE

04:43.009 --> 04:45.028
THIS HUGE DELUSION

04:45.028 --> 04:47.009
		THAT YOU'RE GONNA BEAT

04:45.028 --> 04:47.009
LOUISVILLE SLUGGER

04:47.009 --> 04:48.028
IN THE LONG RUN IS

04:47.009 --> 04:48.028
	JUST DANGEROUS.

04:50.002 --> 04:51.021
			HOLY [BLEEP] SCOTT.

04:51.021 --> 04:53.014
	Scott: YOU KNOW,

04:51.021 --> 04:53.014
		I STARTED THIS OUT OF NOTHING.

04:53.016 --> 04:55.007
I JUST FEEL LIKE I FAILED.

04:59.009 --> 05:00.016
	Lemonis:

04:59.009 --> 05:00.016
			WHEN SCOTT FINALLY ACCEPTED

05:00.016 --> 05:02.002
			THAT IT WAS TIME TO CHANGE,

05:02.004 --> 05:04.021
I KNEW IT WAS TIME

05:02.004 --> 05:04.021
			FOR ME TO NEGOTIATE.

05:04.021 --> 05:09.021
	SO MY OFFER IS $630,000

05:04.021 --> 05:09.021
		FOR 30% OF THE EQUITY,

05:09.021 --> 05:14.016
	AND I'M GONNA WANT A 3% ROYALTY

05:09.021 --> 05:14.016
ON EVERY PRODUCT WE SELL.

05:14.018 --> 05:16.016
		Scott: WE GOT A DEAL.

05:16.018 --> 05:18.021
	Lemonis:

05:16.018 --> 05:18.021
	THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS WAS

05:18.021 --> 05:21.002
	TO FIND COOPERSBURG A NEW HOME.

05:21.004 --> 05:24.009
I LEASED

05:21.004 --> 05:24.009
THIS 20,000 SQUARE FOOT SPACE...

05:24.011 --> 05:25.024
			LOOKS GOOD!

05:25.024 --> 05:29.016
		...A PLACE WHERE WE WOULD GROW

05:25.024 --> 05:29.016
		AND CREATE A PROPER WORK FLOW.

05:29.016 --> 05:31.024
		Scott: IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT?

05:31.024 --> 05:35.002
			Lemonis: AND WHILE WE BEGAN

05:31.024 --> 05:35.002
	TO RENOVATE IT,

05:35.004 --> 05:37.024
	SCOTT WAS PUT IN CHARGE

05:35.004 --> 05:37.024
			OF FORMING NEW PARTNERSHIPS

05:37.024 --> 05:39.009
AND GROWING SALES.

05:39.011 --> 05:41.023
	Scott: THE PURPOSE OF OUR VISIT

05:39.011 --> 05:41.023
	TODAY IS TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE DO

05:41.024 --> 05:43.026
AND WHAT WE CAN DO

05:41.024 --> 05:43.026
			WITH THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY

05:43.026 --> 05:45.005
	THAT WE'VE GOT.

05:45.007 --> 05:47.000
Lemonis: AND THE KIDS WERE

05:45.007 --> 05:47.000
	FINALLY ALLOWED

05:47.002 --> 05:49.014
			TO EXECUTE THEIR OWN IDEAS.

05:49.014 --> 05:50.023
		Jackie: IT WOULD BASICALLY BE

05:49.014 --> 05:50.023
		OUR HOMEGATE,

05:50.024 --> 05:52.028
	LIKE, PARTYWARE LINE --

05:50.024 --> 05:52.028
			AT-HOME TAILGATING.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.024
			-Lemonis: THIS IS AWESOME.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.024
			-Jackie: THANK YOU.

05:54.026 --> 05:57.004
	-Lemonis: IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD.

05:54.026 --> 05:57.004
	-Jackie: YAY, I'M SO EXCITED.

06:02.009 --> 06:03.024
Lemonis: IT'S BEEN

06:02.009 --> 06:03.024
		JUST OVER SEVEN MONTHS

06:03.026 --> 06:05.005
			SINCE WE SHOOK HANDS

06:03.026 --> 06:05.005
			ON THE DEAL.

06:05.007 --> 06:08.019
MY INITIAL INVESTMENT WAS

06:05.007 --> 06:08.019
$635,000,

06:08.021 --> 06:12.009
			BUT TO DATE,

06:08.021 --> 06:12.009
		I HAVE CLOSE TO $1.4 DOLLARS.

06:12.011 --> 06:15.019
			$150,000 WENT TOWARDS PAYING

06:12.011 --> 06:15.019
			ADDITIONAL PAYABLES,

06:15.019 --> 06:20.000
			INCLUDING A $70,000 PAST-DUE

06:15.019 --> 06:20.000
			MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL BILL.

06:20.002 --> 06:23.024
		$200,000 WENT TOWARDS

06:20.002 --> 06:23.024
			BUILDING OUT THE WAREHOUSE.

06:23.024 --> 06:26.016
		THE BALANCE OF THE MONEY WENT

06:23.024 --> 06:26.016
		TOWARDS NEW INVENTORY.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.021
	BUT I HATE TO SAY IT --

06:27.021 --> 06:29.019
I'M ALREADY SEEING

06:27.021 --> 06:29.019
		A PATTERN WITH SCOTT.

06:29.021 --> 06:33.021
			HE'S COME BACK TIME AND TIME

06:29.021 --> 06:33.021
		AND TIME AGAIN FOR MORE MONEY,

06:33.021 --> 06:35.024
WHICH PROMPTED ME

06:33.021 --> 06:35.024
	TO BRING IN DAN,

06:35.026 --> 06:38.019
	A WHARTON MBA GRADUATE,

06:35.026 --> 06:38.019
TO HELP THE FAMILY

06:38.021 --> 06:42.009
	BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY BE MY EYES

06:38.021 --> 06:42.009
AND EARS ON A DAILY BASIS.

06:42.011 --> 06:43.028
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GIVE ME

06:42.011 --> 06:43.028
	A TOUR?

06:43.028 --> 06:46.007
I WANT TO KIND OF HAVE YOU

06:43.028 --> 06:46.007
	WALK ME THROUGH WHAT'S CHANGED.

06:51.005 --> 06:53.009
			WOW.

06:51.005 --> 06:53.009
			LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

06:53.011 --> 06:55.019
			Scott: SO WHAT'S CHANGED IS

06:53.011 --> 06:55.019
		WE TRIED TO ORGANIZE THE BINS

06:55.019 --> 06:57.009
A LITTLE BIT WHERE WE KNOW

06:55.019 --> 06:57.009
		WHAT'S IN EACH AISLE.

06:57.011 --> 06:59.019
YOU CAN WALK DOWN

06:57.011 --> 06:59.019
			AND FIND A BIN LABEL

06:59.019 --> 07:01.009
	TO LOCATE WHAT'S

06:59.019 --> 07:01.009
			ON THAT MASTER LIST.

07:01.009 --> 07:03.007
	Lemonis: IT'S WAY BETTER

07:01.009 --> 07:03.007
			THAN IT USED TO BE.

07:03.007 --> 07:04.019
Scott: IT'S MUCH MORE ORGANIZED.

07:04.019 --> 07:06.026
	Lemonis: I CAN'T BELIEVE

07:04.019 --> 07:06.026
HOW GOOD THIS PLACE LOOKS.

07:06.028 --> 07:08.014
	THE INVENTORY IS

07:06.028 --> 07:08.014
			IN THE RIGHT PLACE.

07:08.016 --> 07:10.026
	THE AISLES ARE LABELED.

07:08.016 --> 07:10.026
			THE SIGNS ARE CLEAR.

07:10.028 --> 07:13.018
AND THAT'S THE WAY

07:10.028 --> 07:13.018
TO RUN A BUSINESS.

07:13.019 --> 07:15.028
DAN WAS TELLING ME

07:13.019 --> 07:15.028
THAT YOU'RE NOW OFFICIALLY

07:16.000 --> 07:17.024
		-IN CHARGE OF THE WAREHOUSE.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.024
		-Ben: YEAH.

07:17.024 --> 07:19.026
	Lemonis: LIKE, WHAT'S DIFFERENT

07:17.024 --> 07:19.026
ABOUT THE PROCESS?

07:19.028 --> 07:21.019
		Ben: WELL, AN ORDER COMES IN.

07:21.021 --> 07:23.011
		YOU WOULD PULL

07:21.021 --> 07:23.011
YOUR RAW MATERIALS

07:23.012 --> 07:25.009
		-FROM THE RACKS OVER HERE...

07:23.012 --> 07:25.009
		-Lemonis: OKAY.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.028
Ben: ...BRING THEM OVER TO

07:25.011 --> 07:26.028
	PRINTING -- RIGHT THROUGH HERE.

07:26.028 --> 07:28.014
-THIS IS WHY WE LEAVE THIS OPEN.

07:26.028 --> 07:28.014
-Lemonis: SO FROM THERE

07:28.014 --> 07:30.011
	-TO THE PRINTING LINE.

07:28.014 --> 07:30.011
	-Ben: YEP.

07:30.012 --> 07:32.021
	THEN, ONCE THEY'RE DONE,

07:30.012 --> 07:32.021
THEY'LL GET PACKAGED HERE

07:32.023 --> 07:35.004
-OR BAR-CODED OVER THERE.

07:32.023 --> 07:35.004
-Lemonis: UH-HUH.

07:35.004 --> 07:37.028
			Ben: AND THEN RIGHT TO HERE.

07:37.028 --> 07:41.012
		AND THEN THEY'LL GET ROUTED

07:37.028 --> 07:41.012
BY SOMEONE AT THE SHIPPING DESK.

07:41.012 --> 07:43.007
		AND THEN, ONCE THEY'RE ROUTED,

07:41.012 --> 07:43.007
		THEY GO OUT THE DOOR.

07:43.009 --> 07:44.028
	Lemonis: THIS IS

07:43.009 --> 07:44.028
A HUGE IMPROVEMENT

07:45.000 --> 07:46.007
	OVER THE OLD WAREHOUSE.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.026
	WE USED TO HAVE TO WALK

07:46.007 --> 07:48.026
	TO FIVE DIFFERENT ROOMS

07:48.028 --> 07:51.002
		JUST TO GET ONE JOB COMPLETED.

07:51.002 --> 07:52.011
NOW, WITH THE NEW PROCESS,

07:52.012 --> 07:55.016
WE'RE ADDING ABOUT $75,000

07:52.012 --> 07:55.016
			A YEAR IN PROFIT --

07:55.018 --> 08:00.005
$50,000 BY ELIMINATING MISTAKES,

07:55.018 --> 08:00.005
KNOWING WHERE THE INVENTORY IS,

08:00.007 --> 08:02.014
	AND DOING THE JOB RIGHT

08:00.007 --> 08:02.014
	THE FIRST TIME,

08:02.014 --> 08:05.028
			AND $25,000

08:02.014 --> 08:05.028
			FROM NOT MISPLACING ORDERS.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.028
		BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS

08:06.000 --> 08:08.028
THE CHANGE IN THE PROCESS ALLOWS

08:09.000 --> 08:11.028
			THE AMOUNT OF ORDERS

08:09.000 --> 08:11.028
			THEY CAN PROCESS TO DOUBLE.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.021
Scott: ASK HER HOW FAR OUT

08:12.000 --> 08:13.021
	SHE IS.

08:13.023 --> 08:14.028
		Lemonis: IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR,

08:14.028 --> 08:17.021
	COOPERSBURG DID

08:14.028 --> 08:17.021
			AROUND $2 MILLION IN SALES.

08:17.023 --> 08:18.028
		IN THEIR CURRENT YEAR,

08:18.028 --> 08:21.016
WE'RE PACING TO DO

08:18.028 --> 08:21.016
ABOUT $3 MILLION IN SALES.

08:21.018 --> 08:24.009
		NOW, THE BUSINESS IS

08:21.018 --> 08:24.009
MUCH CLEANER THAN IT USED TO BE.

08:24.009 --> 08:27.024
			WE WIPED OUT

08:24.009 --> 08:27.024
		OVER $500,000 IN DEBT,

08:27.024 --> 08:30.004
			AND WE'RE FINALLY GONNA TURN

08:27.024 --> 08:30.004
A PROFIT.

08:30.004 --> 08:31.023
	WITH THAT KIND OF GROWTH

08:30.004 --> 08:31.023
		AND POTENTIAL,

08:31.024 --> 08:33.014
	I DON'T MIND PUTTING MORE MONEY

08:31.024 --> 08:33.014
		IN IT.

08:33.014 --> 08:35.009
HOW MUCH WAS THIS MACHINE,

08:33.014 --> 08:35.009
		SCOTT?

08:35.009 --> 08:38.020
	BUT WHAT I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IS

08:35.009 --> 08:38.020
SURPRISES.

08:38.022 --> 08:41.008
Scott: UH, IT WAS ABOUT $85,000.

08:42.004 --> 08:43.014
	THIS IS WHAT IT CAN DO, MARCUS.

08:43.014 --> 08:44.018
	Lemonis: TELL ME

08:43.014 --> 08:44.018
ABOUT THE COST ON THIS --

08:44.019 --> 08:46.004
	RAW MATERIALS, PRINTING.

08:46.004 --> 08:47.028
RIGHT NOW,

08:46.004 --> 08:47.028
			IT'S ABOUT 80 CENTS A TILE.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
	SO THIS HAPPENS

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
			TO BE SIX TILES RIGHT HERE.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
		Lemonis: SO IT'S $5.00

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
		OF MATERIALS.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.020
-Scott: THE MAN OPERATING HAS --

08:52.000 --> 08:53.020
-Lemonis: SO HOW MUCH IS THAT?

08:53.022 --> 08:54.027
		Dan: 12 BUCKS.

08:54.028 --> 08:56.011
	Scott: AND THE PACKAGING ITSELF

08:54.028 --> 08:56.011
			IS $2 to $3.

08:56.013 --> 08:58.023
Lemonis: SO NOW WE'RE UP TO $20.

08:58.024 --> 09:00.003
			FOR EACH MAT THAT WE PRINT,

09:00.004 --> 09:02.028
THE COST OF THE MATERIALS

09:00.004 --> 09:02.028
BREAKS DOWN TO $5,

09:03.000 --> 09:07.001
		$9 FOR THE MACHINE TO OPERATE,

09:03.000 --> 09:07.001
			$3 IN LABOR,

09:07.003 --> 09:10.019
	AND, WITH THE PACKAGING,

09:07.003 --> 09:10.019
		THE COST RISES TO $22 AN ITEM.

09:10.020 --> 09:13.017
NOW WE'RE TALKING

09:10.020 --> 09:13.017
		ABOUT WHOLESALING IT FOR $30.

09:13.018 --> 09:15.022
THAT'S ONLY $8 IN MARGIN.

09:15.023 --> 09:17.020
		BUT SCOTT DOESN'T HAVE

09:15.023 --> 09:17.020
	ANY ORDERS YET.

09:17.022 --> 09:19.010
	HE'S HOPING TO GET SOME ORDERS.

09:19.011 --> 09:23.005
		HE'LL HAVE TO GENERATE

09:19.011 --> 09:23.005
263 ORDERS A MONTH

09:23.006 --> 09:24.014
			JUST TO BREAK EVEN.

09:24.015 --> 09:27.022
I WANT HIM TO HAVE A PLAN

09:24.015 --> 09:27.022
			BEFORE HE SPENDS THE MONEY,

09:27.023 --> 09:31.000
	NOT COME UP WITH A PLAN

09:27.023 --> 09:31.000
		AFTER HE MAKES THE COMMITMENT.

09:31.001 --> 09:32.022
I'M PISSED THAT YOU BOUGHT

09:31.001 --> 09:32.022
			THE PRINTER.

09:32.023 --> 09:34.017
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

09:34.018 --> 09:37.008
		THIS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE

09:34.018 --> 09:37.008
	OF YOU GOING OUT

09:37.009 --> 09:40.014
AND JUST MAKING A DECISION

09:37.009 --> 09:40.014
			REALLY QUICK

09:40.014 --> 09:43.028
		WITHOUT DOING ALL OF THE MATH

09:40.014 --> 09:43.028
	AND ALL OF THE RESEARCH.

09:43.028 --> 09:46.006
	LET'S GO IN YOUR OFFICE

09:43.028 --> 09:46.006
	AND MAYBE TALK ABOUT IT.

09:46.008 --> 09:48.000
			SO NOW THAT WE KNOW

09:46.008 --> 09:48.000
		WE'VE BOUGHT A PRINTER

09:48.000 --> 09:49.014
		THAT WE CAN'T

09:48.000 --> 09:49.014
		EVEN MAKE MONEY WITH,

09:49.014 --> 09:51.024
I WANT TO FIND OUT

09:49.014 --> 09:51.024
EXACTLY FROM SCOTT

09:51.024 --> 09:53.019
	WHAT HE THOUGHT

09:51.024 --> 09:53.019
WE NEEDED MORE MONEY FOR.

09:53.020 --> 09:55.006
TALK TO ME

09:53.020 --> 09:55.006
	ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING.

09:55.008 --> 09:57.004
			Scott: WE'RE TRYING

09:55.008 --> 09:57.004
			TO GET RAW MATERIAL MOVING.

09:57.005 --> 09:59.024
			SO, RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T HAVE

09:57.005 --> 09:59.024
			THE MATERIAL WE NEED

09:59.024 --> 10:01.027
		BECAUSE WE CANNOT PAY

09:59.024 --> 10:01.027
			OUR VENDERS ON TIME

10:01.028 --> 10:03.008
	TO GET PRODUCT IN HERE.

10:03.009 --> 10:05.024
Lemonis: THAT'S CONFUSING TO ME,

10:03.009 --> 10:05.024
	BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T --

10:05.024 --> 10:08.003
			YOU'VE CALLED ME FOR MONEY,

10:05.024 --> 10:08.003
		AND YOU'VE GOTTEN IT.

10:08.004 --> 10:09.023
Dan: WE'RE BEHIND ON THE ORDERS,

10:08.004 --> 10:09.023
AND SO WHAT HAPPENED IS

10:09.024 --> 10:11.011
		-ALL THE SALES HAVE GONE OUT.

10:09.024 --> 10:11.011
		-Lemonis: 'CAUSE THERE'S

10:11.013 --> 10:12.025
			MORE ORDERS THAN YOU THOUGHT

10:11.013 --> 10:12.025
			THERE WAS GONNA BE?

10:12.027 --> 10:15.015
		-Dan: THERE'S MORE ORDERS --

10:12.027 --> 10:15.015
-Scott: THAN ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

10:15.017 --> 10:16.028
			WE'RE OUTSELLING THE FLOOR.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.023
		Lemonis: WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS

10:17.000 --> 10:19.023
			AN AWESOME PROBLEM TO HAVE.

10:19.024 --> 10:21.020
		Scott: AS FAR

10:19.024 --> 10:21.020
			AS THE PRINTER IS CONCERNED,

10:21.022 --> 10:24.015
WE WANT TO PRINT ON THAT PRINTER

10:21.022 --> 10:24.015
TO REACT QUICKLY

10:24.017 --> 10:26.010
TO THIS COLLEGE-MARKET BUSINESS,

10:26.011 --> 10:29.023
		WHICH IS $300,000 TO $400,000

10:26.011 --> 10:29.023
			WORTH OF POTENTIAL COLLEGES.

10:29.024 --> 10:31.009
	Lemonis:

10:29.024 --> 10:31.009
		DO WE HAVE $300,000 OF ORDERS?

10:31.009 --> 10:32.009
	Scott: NOT YET.

10:32.009 --> 10:34.020
Lemonis: OKAY, SO THAT --

10:32.009 --> 10:34.020
THAT'S --

10:34.022 --> 10:38.017
			MY ISSUE ISN'T PUTTING MONEY

10:34.022 --> 10:38.017
		TO CHASE THE BUSINESS.

10:38.018 --> 10:40.028
			MY ISSUE IS PUTTING MONEY IN

10:38.018 --> 10:40.028
	AND NOT KNOWING

10:41.000 --> 10:43.004
		WHAT SCOTT'S GONNA DO WITH IT.

10:43.004 --> 10:45.005
			Scott: I KNOW YOU ABOUT WANT

10:43.004 --> 10:45.005
		TO SHOOT ME RIGHT NOW.

10:45.006 --> 10:47.017
			Lemonis: [ Chuckling ] I DO

10:45.006 --> 10:47.017
KIND OF WANT TO SHOOT YOU.

10:47.018 --> 10:51.000
I DO, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE

10:47.018 --> 10:51.000
			IT JUST NEVER ENDS.

10:51.001 --> 10:53.018
			YOU SEE, WHEN I LOOK

10:51.001 --> 10:53.018
	AT THE $85,000,

10:53.019 --> 10:55.024
			THE QUESTION IS SHOULD IT GO

10:53.019 --> 10:55.024
INTO A NEW MACHINE

10:55.024 --> 10:58.025
FOR ORDERS THAT DON'T EXIST, OR

10:55.024 --> 10:58.025
SHOULD IT GO INTO NEW INVENTORY,

10:58.027 --> 11:01.014
			WHERE I KNOW I HAVE

10:58.027 --> 11:01.014
			A GUARANTEED RETURN?

11:01.014 --> 11:05.022
			SCOTT'S NOT WILLING TO TAKE

11:01.014 --> 11:05.022
			THE TIME TO DO THE ANALYSIS.

11:05.023 --> 11:07.023
	 THAT'S MY ISSUE.

11:07.024 --> 11:09.020
			I THINK THE CONCERN

11:07.024 --> 11:09.020
		THAT I HAVE, SCOTT --

11:09.022 --> 11:10.028
		AND, YOU KNOW,

11:09.022 --> 11:10.028
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS --

11:10.028 --> 11:13.019
		IS THAT OUR ORIGINAL DEAL WAS

11:13.019 --> 11:16.013
		FOR ME TO PUT $630,000

11:13.019 --> 11:16.013
	IN THE BUSINESS.

11:16.014 --> 11:19.018
I'M NOW WELL OVER

11:16.014 --> 11:19.018
	1 MILLION BUCKS.

11:19.019 --> 11:22.010
		AND EVERY TIME

11:19.019 --> 11:22.010
		THAT PHONE CALL COMES, RIGHT,

11:22.011 --> 11:24.014
			IT'S, "WE GOT TO GET

11:22.011 --> 11:24.014
		AN ORDER OUT.

11:24.015 --> 11:26.024
		THIS IS BURNING DOWN.

11:24.015 --> 11:26.024
		THAT'S BURNING DOWN."

11:26.025 --> 11:31.006
	BUT I'M NOT SURE

11:26.025 --> 11:31.006
		WHERE THE END OF THE HOLE IS.

11:32.024 --> 11:34.024
		AND SO HOW MUCH MONEY

11:32.024 --> 11:34.024
	DO YOU THINK YOU NEED RIGHT NOW

11:34.024 --> 11:36.019
			TO KIND OF CLEAN THINGS UP?

11:36.020 --> 11:38.000
	NO B.S., SCOTT.

11:38.001 --> 11:42.027
	Scott: I DON'T WANT TO ASK YOU,

11:38.001 --> 11:42.027
BUT I WOULD SAY $150,000.

11:42.028 --> 11:45.009
	I DON'T WANT TO ASK YOU

11:42.028 --> 11:45.009
			FOR ANOTHER NICKEL.

11:45.010 --> 11:48.018
	AT THE POINT WE ARE RIGHT NOW,

11:45.010 --> 11:48.018
I WANT TO WORK WITH OUR VENDORS,

11:48.019 --> 11:51.019
			HAVE THEM PARTNER WITH US

11:48.019 --> 11:51.019
AND HELP US THROUGH THIS CRISIS.

11:51.020 --> 11:53.003
		OKAY, MAYBE THAT'S NOT

11:51.020 --> 11:53.003
	THE RIGHT WORD.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.014
-I WANT TO HAVE --

11:53.004 --> 11:54.014
-Lemonis: SCOTT, PLEASE.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.009
	RIGHT, I HEAR "CRISIS."

11:56.009 --> 11:58.009
	I HEAR,

11:56.009 --> 11:58.009
		"HOLY COW, WE GOT A PROBLEM."

11:58.010 --> 11:59.014
			THAT FREAKS ME OUT.

11:59.015 --> 12:01.009
			YOU WENT OUT

11:59.015 --> 12:01.009
			AND BOUGHT A PRINTER

12:01.009 --> 12:03.024
			AND YOU SIGNED US UP

12:01.009 --> 12:03.024
			FOR $2,200 A MONTH.

12:03.024 --> 12:07.014
		WHAT I'M SAYING TO MYSELF IS,

12:03.024 --> 12:07.014
"I'LL LEND YOU 150 GRAND.

12:07.015 --> 12:09.022
PAY ME $2,200 A MONTH --

12:07.015 --> 12:09.022
OH, YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT

12:09.023 --> 12:11.009
			A PRINTER YOU DIDN'T NEED."

12:11.010 --> 12:14.020
		IF YOU WERE ME, WOULD YOU STOP

12:11.010 --> 12:14.020
	PUTTING MONEY IN THIS BUSINESS?

HOW MUCH HAVE YOU BEEN AVERAGING

12:23.027 --> 12:25.014
		ON SATURDAY?

12:25.014 --> 12:27.008
Carolyn: WE WERE AVERAGING

12:25.014 --> 12:27.008
	ANYWHERE FROM $5,000 TO $6,000.

12:27.009 --> 12:28.017
	Lemonis:

12:27.009 --> 12:28.017
	AND WHAT DID YOU LAST SATURDAY?

12:28.018 --> 12:30.020
	Carolyn: $9,500.

12:31.028 --> 12:33.008
Gina: DO YOU KNOW

12:31.028 --> 12:33.008
			THE ONE THING I DON'T LIKE?

12:33.009 --> 12:35.019
	ANYBODY [BLEEP]

12:33.009 --> 12:35.019
		WITH PUTTING FOOD ON MY TABLE

12:35.020 --> 12:36.019
	TO FEED MY KIDS.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.008
	Michael:

12:36.020 --> 12:38.008
			I'M CLOSING YOU DOWN FIRST!

12:42.022 --> 12:44.004
	Lemonis: WHAT I'M SAYING

12:42.022 --> 12:44.004
		TO MYSELF IS,

12:44.005 --> 12:47.000
"I'LL LEND YOU 150 GRAND.

12:44.005 --> 12:47.000
	PAY ME $2,200 A MONTH --

12:47.001 --> 12:49.005
OH, YOU CAN'T BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT

12:47.001 --> 12:49.005
		A PRINTER YOU DIDN'T NEED."

12:51.028 --> 12:54.019
		IF YOU WERE ME, WOULD YOU STOP

12:51.028 --> 12:54.019
	PUTTING MONEY IN THIS BUSINESS?

12:59.013 --> 13:01.023
	I'M WILLING TO GIVE YOU

12:59.013 --> 13:01.023
		THE $150,000,

13:01.024 --> 13:03.028
BUT YOU GOT TO BE

13:01.024 --> 13:03.028
			OUT OF THAT MACHINE.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.004
I THINK SCOTT UNDERSTANDS

13:04.000 --> 13:06.004
			HIS MISTAKE.

13:06.005 --> 13:08.008
			AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE

13:06.005 --> 13:08.008
		MORE MISTAKES.

13:08.009 --> 13:09.028
	BUT SCOTT'S A GOOD GUY.

13:09.028 --> 13:12.028
		AND I BELIEVE IN HIM,

13:09.028 --> 13:12.028
AND HE'S A GREAT SALESMAN.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.025
I'M MORE WILLING TO PUT IN MONEY

13:14.027 --> 13:16.024
			AND OVERLOOK

13:14.027 --> 13:16.024
			SOME OF HIS MISTAKES

13:16.024 --> 13:18.023
IF I KNOW HE'S GAINING MOMENTUM.

13:18.024 --> 13:20.003
		Scott: SO, BASKETBALL,

13:20.004 --> 13:22.003
	-BASEBALL, HOCKEY.

13:20.004 --> 13:22.003
	-Lemonis: WHAT'S THIS?

13:22.004 --> 13:24.000
Scott: THAT'S THE BASS PRO FISH,

13:22.004 --> 13:24.000
AND THIS IS THE CAR, THE NASCAR.

13:24.001 --> 13:25.006
	Lemonis: OH, THIS IS IT?

13:25.008 --> 13:26.020
		Scott: WHICH I WANTED

13:25.008 --> 13:26.020
		TO HAVE READY FOR YOU,

13:26.022 --> 13:28.003
			-BUT IT'S NOT QUITE READY.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.003
			-Lemonis: OKAY.

13:28.004 --> 13:31.024
			WE KNOW THAT NASCAR FANS BUY

13:28.004 --> 13:31.024
			NASCAR PRODUCTS RELIGIOUSLY.

13:31.025 --> 13:33.023
SO THIS IS

13:31.025 --> 13:33.023
			ALL THE OTHER NASCAR STUFF.

13:33.024 --> 13:35.001
Jackie: WE HAVE OUR PONCHO

13:33.024 --> 13:35.001
IN A BALL.

13:35.003 --> 13:36.023
		THIS ONE HAPPENS TO BE

13:35.003 --> 13:36.023
IN A TIRE.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.000
	Lemonis: IS THIS

13:36.024 --> 13:38.000
HOW IT ACTUALLY...

13:38.001 --> 13:40.009
			Jackie: YEP,

13:38.001 --> 13:40.009
		INSIDE IS A DISPOSABLE PONCHO.

13:40.009 --> 13:41.014
		Lemonis: THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

13:41.014 --> 13:43.028
			WE'RE NOW LICENSING PONCHOS

13:41.014 --> 13:43.028
		AND UMBRELLAS,

13:43.028 --> 13:46.023
			AND WE SELL THOSE AT ALL OF

13:43.028 --> 13:46.023
		THE TRACKS AROUND THE COUNTRY.

13:46.024 --> 13:48.024
TAKE THIS TYPICAL UMBRELLA

13:46.024 --> 13:48.024
			WITH NASCAR.

13:48.025 --> 13:52.003
IT COSTS US $8.00 TO MAKE.

13:48.025 --> 13:52.003
		WE'LL SELL FOR $23 --

13:52.004 --> 13:53.028
			A $15 GROSS PROFIT.

13:53.028 --> 13:55.024
			THE FEE WE PAY TO NASCAR IS

13:55.025 --> 13:58.009
	A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE

13:55.025 --> 13:58.009
			OF THE $23,

13:58.009 --> 14:00.019
		LEAVING US WITH PLENTY

13:58.009 --> 14:00.019
	OF GROSS PROFIT.

14:00.020 --> 14:02.019
WHEN I FIRST CAME

14:00.020 --> 14:02.019
	TO COOPERSBURG,

14:02.020 --> 14:05.006
		THEY WERE A BASEBALL COMPANY,

14:02.020 --> 14:05.006
	AND THAT WAS IT.

14:05.008 --> 14:08.005
AND WE'VE NOT ONLY EXPANDED THE

14:05.008 --> 14:08.005
TYPES OF PRODUCT THAT THEY HAVE,

14:08.006 --> 14:10.017
BUT WE'VE EXPANDED

14:08.006 --> 14:10.017
		OUR LICENSING.

14:10.018 --> 14:12.028
			Scott: WE GOING TO CALL THIS

14:10.018 --> 14:12.028
		THE SOUVENIR STATION,

14:13.000 --> 14:14.014
	SO IN THE GROCERY STORE,

14:13.000 --> 14:14.014
		YOU COME HERE.

14:14.014 --> 14:16.009
	Lemonis: SO THIS IS NEW,

14:14.014 --> 14:16.009
	AND THIS IS NEW?

14:16.009 --> 14:17.022
			Scott: YEAH,

14:16.009 --> 14:17.022
		IT WILL ALL BE THE SAME TEAM.

14:17.023 --> 14:20.009
		NOW THE IDEA IS WALMART WANTS

14:17.023 --> 14:20.009
		TO BUY A FULL PROGRAM

14:20.009 --> 14:23.014
THAT THEY ROLL OUT WHEN IT RAINS

14:20.009 --> 14:23.014
			WITH PONCHOS AND UMBRELLAS

14:23.014 --> 14:24.023
	THAT BENDS NEW MARGINS.

14:24.024 --> 14:26.027
		IT'S BIG. WE'RE WORKING ON IT

14:24.024 --> 14:26.027
	RIGHT NOW, JACKIE AND I.

14:26.028 --> 14:27.028
			Lemonis: WALMART HAS PLACED

14:27.028 --> 14:30.000
			A HUGE ORDER

14:27.028 --> 14:30.000
FOR THE SOUVENIR STATION.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.014
			IT'S GONNA GO INTO THOUSANDS

14:30.000 --> 14:33.014
	OF WALMARTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

14:33.015 --> 14:36.028
		THE ORDER THEY JUST PLACED WAS

14:33.015 --> 14:36.028
A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

14:36.028 --> 14:38.014
			THAT WAS THEIR FIRST ORDER.

14:38.015 --> 14:42.028
		THIS BUSINESS AND THIS FAMILY

14:38.015 --> 14:42.028
		HAVE COME A LONG WAY.

14:42.028 --> 14:45.023
	FIVE MONTHS AGO,

14:42.028 --> 14:45.023
	WE WERE IN A VERY TOXIC,

14:45.024 --> 14:48.001
		DISORGANIZED BUILDING.

14:48.003 --> 14:50.004
AND TODAY,

14:48.003 --> 14:50.004
	THE CONVERSATION'S REALLY BEEN,

14:50.005 --> 14:52.015
			"WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HELP.

14:50.005 --> 14:52.015
WE HAVE MORE SALES THAN --

14:52.017 --> 14:54.008
	WE'RE 30 ORDERS BEHIND."

14:54.009 --> 14:57.015
	AND SO, IT FEELS A LITTLE BIT

14:54.009 --> 14:57.015
LIKE A DIFFERENT BUSINESS TODAY.

14:57.017 --> 14:59.011
AND SO I THINK YOU GUYS HONESTLY

14:59.013 --> 15:01.000
		SHOULD PAT YOURSELVES

14:59.013 --> 15:01.000
			ON THE BACK.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.018
		BUSINESS IS GONNA PROBABLY BE

15:02.019 --> 15:04.028
SOMEWHERE

15:02.019 --> 15:04.028
			AROUND $3 MILLION THIS YEAR.

15:04.028 --> 15:07.000
	LAST YEAR, THEY DID $2 MILLION.

15:07.001 --> 15:08.009
			BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS

15:08.009 --> 15:10.028
			THAT OUR MARGINS ARE CLOSER

15:08.009 --> 15:10.028
TO 50% --

15:11.000 --> 15:14.009
		ABOUT 12 POINTS HIGHER

15:11.000 --> 15:14.009
THAN THEY WERE A YEAR AGO.

15:14.009 --> 15:15.024
	I'M A LOT MORE CONFIDENT

15:14.009 --> 15:15.024
THAT WE'RE HEADING

15:15.025 --> 15:17.011
	IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

15:23.019 --> 15:25.024
		I'VE INVESTED

15:23.019 --> 15:25.024
			IN ALL SORTS OF BUSINESSES.

15:25.025 --> 15:28.001
AND, TYPICALLY, RETAIL IS

15:25.025 --> 15:28.001
IN MY WHEELHOUSE.

15:28.003 --> 15:31.013
THIS WILL END UP BECOMING

15:28.003 --> 15:31.013
		OUR SIGNATURE PRODUCT.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.014
			WHEN I WAS CONTACTED

15:31.014 --> 15:33.014
BY A WOMAN IN LONG ISLAND

15:33.014 --> 15:36.014
			WHO OWNED FOUR HAIR SALONS,

15:33.014 --> 15:36.014
	I HAD MY DOUBTS.

15:36.015 --> 15:38.019
			HAIR SALONS AREN'T MY THING.

15:38.020 --> 15:42.003
		BUT WHEN I MET CAROLYN DeVITO,

15:38.020 --> 15:42.003
			WE CLICKED.

15:42.004 --> 15:43.019
		HOW YOU DOING?

15:42.004 --> 15:43.019
			I'M MARCUS.

15:43.019 --> 15:45.013
Carolyn: HI. I'M CAROLYN.

15:43.019 --> 15:45.013
NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:45.014 --> 15:46.025
		Lemonis: AND I DECIDED

15:45.014 --> 15:46.025
	TO STICK AROUND

15:46.027 --> 15:48.010
			AND SEE IF I COULD HELP HER.

15:48.011 --> 15:50.022
Carolyn: THIS IS TUESDAY.

15:48.011 --> 15:50.022
IT'S USUALLY A LOT BUSIER.

15:50.023 --> 15:53.027
	Lemonis:

15:50.023 --> 15:53.027
	UNIQUE OFFERS EVERYTHING

15:50.023 --> 15:53.027
FROM HAIRCUTS TO MASSAGES.

15:53.028 --> 15:56.025
		SHE EVEN HAD

15:53.028 --> 15:56.025
HER OWN PERSONAL HAIR CARE LINE.

15:56.027 --> 15:58.014
	BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

15:56.027 --> 15:58.014
		I SAW PROBLEMS

15:58.015 --> 16:00.010
			THE MINUTE I WALKED

15:58.015 --> 16:00.010
THROUGH THAT DOOR.

16:00.011 --> 16:02.013
THE PLACE LOOKED VERY	 RUNDOWN...

16:02.014 --> 16:03.010
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

16:03.011 --> 16:05.001
			...WITH VERY FEW CUSTOMERS.

16:05.003 --> 16:08.024
AT FIRST GLANCE, IT'S NOT

16:05.003 --> 16:08.024
	THE MOST INVITING SPACE.

16:08.024 --> 16:11.017
			AND SHE HAD

16:08.024 --> 16:11.017
MAJOR INVENTORY PROBLEMS.

16:11.018 --> 16:13.006
	YOU SEE THOSE HAIR DYES?

16:13.008 --> 16:16.009
	AT ABOUT $20 PER BOTTLE,

16:13.008 --> 16:16.009
THOSE REPRESENTED

16:16.009 --> 16:18.023
		THE BIGGEST LIABILITY

16:16.009 --> 16:18.023
		IN CAROLYN'S BUSINESS,

16:18.024 --> 16:20.010
			AND NO ONE WAS TRACKING IT.

16:20.011 --> 16:22.000
		YOU DON'T KNOW

16:20.011 --> 16:22.000
		WHAT YOU HAVE IN HERE, DO YOU?

16:22.001 --> 16:24.023
	Carolyn:

16:22.001 --> 16:24.023
		WE REORDER BASED ON WHAT COMES

16:22.001 --> 16:24.023
OUT OF THAT GARBAGE PAIL.

16:25.024 --> 16:27.009
	Lemonis:

16:25.024 --> 16:27.009
CAROLYN'S GENERAL MANAGER,

16:27.010 --> 16:29.006
	WELL, SHE WASN'T

16:27.010 --> 16:29.006
GENERAL-MANAGING.

16:29.008 --> 16:31.013
		Woman:

16:29.008 --> 16:31.013
			I'M HERE TO HELP YOU MANAGE,

16:31.014 --> 16:34.008
		NOT MANAGE YOUR SALON,

16:31.014 --> 16:34.008
	SO DON'T START WITH ME.

16:35.028 --> 16:38.014
		Woman #2: SHE'S OFF SATURDAY,

16:35.028 --> 16:38.014
			SUNDAY, AND MONDAY.

16:38.014 --> 16:40.027
Woman #3: OUR BIGGEST DAY,

16:38.014 --> 16:40.027
SHE'S NOT EVEN A PART OF.

16:40.028 --> 16:42.000
	Lemonis:

16:40.028 --> 16:42.000
		WELL, WHAT DO I NEED HER FOR?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.008
		Carolyn: INVENTORY SYSTEMS --

16:43.009 --> 16:44.023
Lemonis: ALL THESE THINGS

16:43.009 --> 16:44.023
		THAT AREN'T HAPPENING.

16:47.009 --> 16:49.022
SOMETHING'S GOT TO CHANGE,

16:47.009 --> 16:49.022
	'CAUSE THIS MODEL DOESN'T WORK.

16:49.023 --> 16:51.006
			IT'S TOTALLY BROKEN.

16:52.001 --> 16:54.011
			AND ALL THESE PROBLEMS WERE

16:52.001 --> 16:54.011
		COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT

16:54.013 --> 16:56.001
THAT SHE HAD SPLIT

16:54.013 --> 16:56.001
WITH HER PARTNER.

16:56.003 --> 16:58.015
	Carolyn: YOU ALMOST PUT

16:56.003 --> 16:58.015
MY FAMILY OUT OF A HOUSE.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.024
Man: I DON'T CARE.

17:01.010 --> 17:04.010
	Lemonis:

17:01.010 --> 17:04.010
AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

17:01.010 --> 17:04.010
	OF DOLLARS HAD BEEN SQUANDERED.

17:04.011 --> 17:06.001
			Carolyn: [ Voice breaking ]

17:04.011 --> 17:06.001
I'M BEHIND ON MY MORTGAGE,

17:06.002 --> 17:07.021

33:48.002 --> 33:49.027
		Lemonis: AND WHAT ELSE

33:48.002 --> 33:49.027
ARE YOU MANAGING?

33:49.028 --> 33:52.027
	Tammy: STAFFING,

33:49.028 --> 33:52.027
			ANY HUMAN-RESOURCES ISSUES,

33:52.028 --> 33:54.022
	ANY CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS,

33:52.028 --> 33:54.022
			SCHEDULING.

33:54.023 --> 33:56.007
			-Lemonis: EMPLOYEE ISSUES?

33:54.023 --> 33:56.007
			-Tammy: SPECIAL EVENTS.

33:56.008 --> 33:58.025
			Lemonis: THE ONLY THING THAT

33:56.008 --> 33:58.025
			JIM AND I ACTUALLY AGREED ON

33:58.026 --> 34:00.006
WAS TAMMY'S VALUE.

34:00.007 --> 34:01.011
			Jim: SHE'S A GREAT EMPLOYEE.

34:01.012 --> 34:02.025
			SHE DOES EVERYTHING

34:01.012 --> 34:02.025
	THAT NEEDS TO GET DONE.

34:02.026 --> 34:04.023
			AND SHE WORKS TWO AND A HALF

34:02.026 --> 34:04.023
		DAYS A WEEK AT HER OTHER JOB.

34:05.021 --> 34:09.003
Lemonis: SHE WAS WORKING

34:05.021 --> 34:09.003
40 HOURS A WEEK AND MAKING $300.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.012
SHE WAS THE HEART AND SOUL

34:09.005 --> 34:11.012
		OF THIS PLACE.

34:11.014 --> 34:12.018
			Jim: I WISH

34:11.014 --> 34:12.018
			I COULD PAY HER MORE MONEY,

34:12.018 --> 34:14.000
BUT I CAN'T AFFORD IT RIGHT NOW.

34:14.001 --> 34:16.012
Lemonis: JIM AND ALLISON WEREN'T

34:14.001 --> 34:16.012
		EVEN ABLE TO PAY THEMSELVES.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.012
			WHEN'S THE LAST TIME

34:16.012 --> 34:18.012
			YOU TOOK A PAYCHECK?

34:18.014 --> 34:20.010
			-Allison: SEVEN MONTHS AGO.

34:18.014 --> 34:20.010
			-Lemonis: OKAY.

34:20.012 --> 34:22.012
	THE BUSINESS WAS

34:20.012 --> 34:22.012
	ON ITS LAST LEG.

34:22.014 --> 34:24.025
IF THEY DON'T TURN

34:22.014 --> 34:24.025
THIS BUSINESS AROUND SOON,

34:24.025 --> 34:26.012
			THERE WON'T BE ANY BUSINESS.

34:26.014 --> 34:28.003
Jim: DAMN IT, I'M TIRED OF THIS.

34:28.003 --> 34:30.005
Lemonis: LOOK, THIS PLACE

34:28.003 --> 34:30.005
		HAD POTENTIAL,

34:30.005 --> 34:32.021
	BUT IF WE COULD TURN IT

34:30.005 --> 34:32.021
		INTO A REAL PIE STORE,

34:32.021 --> 34:35.012
		A DESTINATION,

34:32.021 --> 34:35.012
NOT A CLUTTERED MINI-MART,

34:35.012 --> 34:38.010
			WITH PIES THAT ARE HOMEMADE

34:35.012 --> 34:38.010
			WITH PROPRIETARY INGREDIENTS

34:38.010 --> 34:40.027
	IN GREAT FLAVORS

34:38.010 --> 34:40.027
	AND A GREAT ATMOSPHERE,

34:41.000 --> 34:42.012
	THEN THIS PLACE WOULD BE GREAT.

34:42.014 --> 34:45.009
			AND IF JIM AND ALLISON COULD

34:42.014 --> 34:45.009
		AGREE, THEN WE'D HAVE A DEAL.

34:45.010 --> 34:48.010
I WILL PUT UP TO $450,000

34:48.012 --> 34:51.009
TO SATISFY THE PAYABLES AS

34:48.012 --> 34:51.009
	NEEDED.

34:51.010 --> 34:54.027
	I WILL HAVE 51%.

34:51.010 --> 34:54.027
YOU WILL HAVE 49%.

34:54.027 --> 34:56.014
	Jim: NO,

34:54.027 --> 34:56.014
	THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

34:56.016 --> 34:58.014
Lemonis: WHAT IF WE MAKE,

34:56.016 --> 34:58.014
			FOR A WAGE,

34:58.016 --> 35:01.025
			$1.00 FOR EVERY PIE

34:58.016 --> 35:01.025
		THAT WE SELL?

35:01.027 --> 35:03.027
		-DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

35:01.027 --> 35:03.027
		-Jim: WE HAVE A DEAL.

35:03.027 --> 35:05.009
Lemonis: AND WITH THE DEAL DONE,

35:05.010 --> 35:08.001
	I MADE MY FIRST

35:05.010 --> 35:08.001
	AND MOST IMPORTANT MOVE.

35:08.001 --> 35:10.012
I HAVE TO TELL YOU

35:08.001 --> 35:10.012
WE NEED YOU HERE.

35:10.012 --> 35:14.003
AND THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT

35:10.012 --> 35:14.003
		THAN ANY PIE WE'LL EVER MAKE,

35:14.005 --> 35:15.014
		BUT I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.

35:15.016 --> 35:17.012
	YOU'RE GONNA BE

35:15.016 --> 35:17.012
		OUR LEADER HERE, OKAY?

35:17.014 --> 35:18.016
			Tammy: OKAY.

35:18.018 --> 35:20.012
		Lemonis: BUT IN ORDER

35:18.018 --> 35:20.012
FOR YOU TO BE ABLE

35:20.012 --> 35:22.005
		TO HAVE A GOOD PEACE OF MIND,

35:22.005 --> 35:24.021
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU

35:22.005 --> 35:24.021
	SIX MONTHS WORTH OF PAY,

35:24.023 --> 35:27.014
		AND I'M GONNA PAY YOU

35:24.023 --> 35:27.014
		$1,000 A WEEK

35:27.014 --> 35:29.007
		SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BARTEND.

35:31.005 --> 35:32.019
Tammy: [ LAUGHS ]

35:32.021 --> 35:33.021
		Lemonis: OKAY?

35:33.021 --> 35:35.010
			Tammy: [ SNIFFLES ]

35:35.012 --> 35:37.007
THANK YOU.

35:38.016 --> 35:40.014
			Lemonis: THE REASON

35:38.016 --> 35:40.014
		THAT I DID THE DEAL IS

35:40.016 --> 35:43.023
			BECAUSE I KNEW THAT IF I HAD

35:40.016 --> 35:43.023
			SOMEBODY LIKE TAMMY

35:43.023 --> 35:46.023
	THAT THE CHANCES

35:43.023 --> 35:46.023
	OF IT SUCCEEDING

35:46.023 --> 35:48.016
			WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER.

35:48.018 --> 35:50.009
			IF WE DON'T MAKE IT,

35:48.018 --> 35:50.009
WE DON'T SELL IT.

35:50.010 --> 35:52.009
	EVERYTHING'S $1!

35:50.010 --> 35:52.009
			COME ON IN!

35:52.010 --> 35:56.005
			WE MADE ROOM

35:52.010 --> 35:56.005
FOR OUR $200,000 OVERHAUL.

35:56.007 --> 35:59.001
		I'M GONNA WANT TO HAVE

35:56.007 --> 35:59.001
RECLAIMED WOOD EVERYWHERE.

35:59.001 --> 36:00.005
Jim: I LIKE THAT.

36:01.028 --> 36:04.019
			Lemonis: THE KITCHEN GOT NEW

36:01.028 --> 36:04.019
		APPLIANCES AND NEW EQUIPMENT,

36:04.021 --> 36:07.007
AND WE ADDED A NEW DESSERT

36:04.021 --> 36:07.007
	AND BEVERAGE BAR

36:07.009 --> 36:09.028
		ALL TO ENHANCE

36:07.009 --> 36:09.028
	THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.

36:12.018 --> 36:15.010
	WE WENT TO WORK CREATING

36:12.018 --> 36:15.010
			A NEW RECIPE

36:15.012 --> 36:19.007
		WITH FRESH INGREDIENTS

36:15.012 --> 36:19.007
		AND A HOMEMADE CRUST.

36:19.009 --> 36:21.001
IT'S GOOD.

36:21.001 --> 36:25.021
WITH TAMMY IN CHARGE, THE

36:21.001 --> 36:25.021
		BUSINESS SKYROCKETED OVER 18%.

36:25.023 --> 36:29.010
		BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT WENT

36:25.023 --> 36:29.010
			FROM LOSING $100,000 A YEAR

36:29.010 --> 36:30.023
	TO MAKING MONEY.

36:30.025 --> 36:32.014
			Woman: I WOULD LIKE

36:30.025 --> 36:32.014
	A PIECE OF KEY LIME PIE.

36:32.014 --> 36:33.027
	-DO YOU WANT ONE, TOO?

36:32.014 --> 36:33.027
	-Woman #2: YES, PLEASE.

36:33.028 --> 36:36.007
		-Woman #3: THIS IS GREAT PIE.

36:33.028 --> 36:36.007
		-Man: BEST KEY LIME PIE EVER.

36:36.007 --> 36:38.012
Lemonis: HOW'S THIS FEEL TO YOU?

36:38.012 --> 36:39.019
			Tammy: IT'S AWESOME.

36:39.021 --> 36:42.012
		HAVING ONE JOB AND BEING ABLE

36:39.021 --> 36:42.012
TO SPEND MORE TIME

36:42.012 --> 36:45.007
WITH MY CHILDREN,

36:42.012 --> 36:45.007
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

36:46.025 --> 36:49.001
			[ Voice breaking ] I CAN'T.

36:46.025 --> 36:49.001
[ LAUGHS ]

36:53.016 --> 36:56.003
		Lemonis: IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR

36:53.016 --> 36:56.003
			SINCE I MADE MY INVESTMENT,

36:56.005 --> 36:58.023
			AND, UNFORTUNATELY,

36:56.005 --> 36:58.023
	MY INVESTMENT HAS HAD TO DOUBLE

36:58.023 --> 37:01.010
TO OVER $700,000.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.014
		THE ADDITIONAL MONIES

37:01.010 --> 37:03.014
			THAT I HAD TO PUT IN

37:03.014 --> 37:05.027
TOOK CARE OF BILLS

37:03.014 --> 37:05.027
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT.

37:05.027 --> 37:07.019
		THEY TOOK CARE OF IRS PAYMENTS

37:07.021 --> 37:09.025
		THAT WERE MORE THAN I THOUGHT

37:07.021 --> 37:09.025
		THEY WERE GOING TO BE.

37:09.027 --> 37:11.025
	AND IT TOOK CARE

37:09.027 --> 37:11.025
		OF OTHER SMALL ISSUES

37:11.025 --> 37:14.016
			TO GET THE STORE TO EXACTLY

37:11.025 --> 37:14.016
	WHERE I WANTED IT TO BE.

37:14.018 --> 37:15.021
	WHAT'S HAPPENING, TAMMY?

37:15.023 --> 37:17.001
		Tammy: MARCUS.

37:17.001 --> 37:20.007
		-Lemonis: HOW ARE YOU?

37:17.001 --> 37:20.007
		-Tammy: GOOD.

37:20.009 --> 37:21.010
	Lemonis: THE PLACE LOOKS GREAT.

37:21.012 --> 37:22.016
Tammy: THANK YOU.

37:22.016 --> 37:23.021
	-Lemonis: HOW ARE YOU?

37:22.016 --> 37:23.021
	-Shelisa: I'M GOOD.

37:23.023 --> 37:25.003
Lemonis: HOW LONG

37:23.023 --> 37:25.003
			HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

37:25.005 --> 37:27.012
		-Shelisa: FOR TWO MONTHS NOW.

37:25.005 --> 37:27.012
-Lemonis: AND IS SHE MEAN?

37:27.012 --> 37:29.007
		Shelisa: NO, SHE'S VERY NICE.

37:27.012 --> 37:29.007
		I LIKE MY JOB.

37:29.009 --> 37:30.018
			Lemonis: YOU LIKE YOUR JOB?

37:29.009 --> 37:30.018
		GOOD.

37:30.019 --> 37:32.005
AND WHAT'S

37:30.019 --> 37:32.005
			YOUR FAVORITE PIECE OF PIE?

37:32.007 --> 37:34.010
-Shelisa: THE MANGO.

37:32.007 --> 37:34.010
-Lemonis: THE MANGO PIE?

37:34.012 --> 37:36.018
			-WE HAVE MANGO PIE NOW?

37:34.012 --> 37:36.018
			-Tammy: WE HAVE MANGO PIE.

37:36.019 --> 37:37.025
			Lemonis: VERY COOL.

37:37.025 --> 37:38.027
	TAMMY TOOK ANOTHER STEP

37:38.027 --> 37:40.023
			IN MOVING US

37:38.027 --> 37:40.023
	IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION,

37:40.025 --> 37:42.019
LIKE SELLING PIE IN A CUP.

37:42.021 --> 37:44.007
			DO PEOPLE LIKE THIS?

37:44.007 --> 37:46.012
	Tammy: THEY DO.

37:44.007 --> 37:46.012
			THEY LIKE TO SEE IT.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.021
Lemonis: WHAT ARE

37:46.014 --> 37:47.021
			WE SELLING THIS FOR?

37:47.021 --> 37:48.025
		Tammy: $5.95.

37:48.027 --> 37:50.005
			Lemonis: WHAT DOES IT COST?

37:50.007 --> 37:51.016
		Tammy: $1.09.

37:51.016 --> 37:53.007
			-Lemonis: SO, GOOD MARGIN.

37:51.016 --> 37:53.007
			-Tammy: YEAH.

37:53.009 --> 37:54.014
	Lemonis: ARE YOU SELLING

37:53.009 --> 37:54.014
	A LOT OF THESE?

37:54.014 --> 37:55.018
		Tammy: WE ARE.

37:55.019 --> 37:57.012
		Lemonis: WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED

37:55.019 --> 37:57.012
			IN KEY WEST,

37:57.012 --> 37:59.016
		THEY WERE DOING ABOUT

37:57.012 --> 37:59.016
		$1 MILLION A YEAR OF BUSINESS,

37:59.016 --> 38:02.016
			BUT THEY WERE LOSING

37:59.016 --> 38:02.016
		ABOUT $100,000 A YEAR.

38:02.016 --> 38:04.027
			TODAY, IT'S GONNA DO

38:02.016 --> 38:04.027
			ABOUT $1.2 MILLION.

38:04.027 --> 38:06.016
		THAT'S A 20% INCREASE.

38:06.018 --> 38:09.003
			BUT WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT IS

38:06.018 --> 38:09.003
		THAT THE MARGINS WENT

38:09.005 --> 38:12.012
	FROM 15% TO 35%.

38:12.014 --> 38:16.001
			AND SO THAT $100,000 LOSS IS

38:12.014 --> 38:16.001
		NOW LOOKING MORE LIKE

38:16.001 --> 38:18.023
		ABOUT $100,000 PROFIT

38:16.001 --> 38:18.023
	AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

38:18.025 --> 38:21.018
	WHAT'S HAPPENING

38:18.025 --> 38:21.018
		WITH JIM AND ALLISON?

38:21.018 --> 38:23.018
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM THEM?

38:23.018 --> 38:24.023
			Tammy: AH...

38:34.001 --> 38:37.003
Lemonis: WHAT'S HAPPENING

38:34.001 --> 38:37.003
		WITH JIM AND ALLISON?

38:37.003 --> 38:38.025
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM THEM?

38:38.025 --> 38:40.001
			Tammy: YEAH.

38:40.003 --> 38:41.025
			Lemonis: JIM AND ALLISON ARE

38:40.003 --> 38:41.025
NO LONGER INVOLVED

38:41.025 --> 38:43.018
		IN THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS.

38:43.019 --> 38:46.000
			WHEN I DID THE DEAL,

38:43.019 --> 38:46.000
		I PUT TAMMY IN CHARGE,

38:46.001 --> 38:48.009
			AND THE PROBLEM WAS

38:46.001 --> 38:48.009
		THAT JIM KEPT GETTING INVOLVED

38:48.010 --> 38:50.003
		AND KIND OF UNDERMINING TAMMY

38:50.005 --> 38:52.016
			AND REALLY CREATING CONFLICT

38:50.005 --> 38:52.016
			WITH THE EMPLOYEES.

38:52.018 --> 38:55.012
	AND SO THE BEST THING TO DO WAS

38:52.018 --> 38:55.012
	FOR ME TO BUY THEM OUT.

38:55.014 --> 38:57.016
SO ALL OF THE DEBT GOT WIPED OUT

38:57.016 --> 38:59.001
			AND THEY GOT A CHECK

38:57.016 --> 38:59.001
		FOR SOME CASH

38:59.001 --> 39:00.014
THAT THEY CAN PUT

38:59.001 --> 39:00.014
	IN THEIR POCKET.

39:00.014 --> 39:03.027
		AND FURTHERMORE, THE ROYALTY,

39:00.014 --> 39:03.027
THE $1.00 PER PIE

39:03.027 --> 39:06.010
			AND 15 CENTS A PIE SLICE IS

39:06.012 --> 39:08.027
TURNING OUT TO BE

39:06.012 --> 39:08.027
	VERY LUCRATIVE FOR THEM.

39:08.027 --> 39:09.025
		WHAT HAPPENED?

39:09.025 --> 39:12.025
			Tammy: WE HAD A FALLING OUT.

39:12.025 --> 39:14.010
			-Lemonis: YOU AND JIM DID?

39:12.025 --> 39:14.010
			-Tammy: SO -- YEAH.

39:14.010 --> 39:17.019
			HE WANTED TO CONTINUE SAYING

39:14.010 --> 39:17.019
	WHAT WE WERE STILL DOING WRONG.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.014
I MEAN, IT'S JIM.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.014
		HE'S NOT GONNA CHANGE.

39:19.014 --> 39:21.012
Lemonis: I THINK JIM WOULD

39:19.014 --> 39:21.012
	STILL LIKE TO BE

39:21.012 --> 39:22.023
	A PART OF THE BUSINESS,

39:22.025 --> 39:24.016
	BUT HE'S NOT A BAD GUY.

39:24.016 --> 39:28.001
HE'S JUST NOT THE GREATEST

39:24.016 --> 39:28.001
		EMPLOYER IN THE WORLD.

39:28.003 --> 39:29.025
			HOW MANY NEW FLAVORS

39:28.003 --> 39:29.025
	DO YOU HAVE NOW?

39:29.027 --> 39:31.023
	Tammy: BLUEBERRY, MANGO,

39:36.007 --> 39:37.014
THAT, IN KEY WEST,

39:37.016 --> 39:40.001

39:37.016 --> 39:40.001
	OF KEY LIME PIE PLACES.

39:40.003 --> 39:41.027
	BUT NOT EVERYBODY LIKES

39:40.003 --> 39:41.027
		KEY LIME PIE.

39:41.028 --> 39:44.016
		AND SO SHE WANTED TO COME UP

39:41.028 --> 39:44.016
WITH SOME OTHER TROPICAL FLAVORS

39:44.018 --> 39:46.027
			THAT WOULD ALLOW US

	TO SELL TO MORE PEOPLE.

COME ON DOWN FOR SOME PIE!

40:25.027 --> 40:27.028

40:25.027 --> 40:27.028
AS A KEY LIME PIE,

40:28.000 --> 40:29.012
EXCEPT NO KEY LIME JUICE.

40:29.014 --> 40:32.025
WE'RE USING A BLOOD ORANGE PUREE

40:29.014 --> 40:32.025
	OR FRESH BLUEBERRIES.

40:32.027 --> 40:34.005
	Woman: IT'S REALLY GOOD.

	IT GIVES US THE ABILITY

40:43.010 --> 40:46.000
TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS,

40:46.001 --> 40:48.027

40:46.001 --> 40:48.027
			WE'RE GONNA MAKE MORE MONEY.

40:48.028 --> 40:51.001
	-WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

40:48.028 --> 40:51.001
	-Woman: IT'S PRETTY DAMN GOOD.

41:01.025 --> 41:03.021
	Lemonis:

41:01.025 --> 41:03.021
			THIS PLACE IS ALWAYS PACKED.

41:03.023 --> 41:05.010
		Tammy: MM-HMM.

41:05.012 --> 41:07.005
IT'S A GOOD THING WE SELL

41:05.012 --> 41:07.005
OUR PIE BARS HERE.

41:07.005 --> 41:08.016
		-Lemonis: GOOD THING.

41:07.005 --> 41:08.016
		-Tammy: [ LAUGHS ]

41:08.018 --> 41:11.000
		I WANTED TO TAKE TAMMY

41:08.018 --> 41:11.000
			BACK TO HOGFISH BAR,

41:11.001 --> 41:13.014
THE PLACE

41:11.001 --> 41:13.014
	SHE USED TO BARTEND AT.

41:13.014 --> 41:15.009
		I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

41:13.014 --> 41:15.009
		A PERFECT PLACE TO TALK TO HER

41:15.010 --> 41:20.009
	ABOUT SOMETHING

41:15.010 --> 41:20.009
REALLY IMPORTANT.

41:20.010 --> 41:23.003
BUT EVERY COMMENT

41:20.010 --> 41:23.003
I GET FROM EVERY CUSTOMER,

41:23.003 --> 41:25.023
			WHETHER IT'S ON YELP

41:23.003 --> 41:25.023
OR WHETHER IT'S ON TWITTER

41:25.025 --> 41:29.028
		OR FACEBOOK OR WHATEVER, IS

41:25.025 --> 41:29.028
ALWAYS, "I WENT TO THE PIE SHOP.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.023
			I MET TAMMY.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.023
		THE PLACE IS AWESOME."

41:32.023 --> 41:36.005
	AND SO, I THINK, FOR ME,

41:32.023 --> 41:36.005
		MY CONFIDENCE IN THE BUSINESS

41:36.005 --> 41:39.000
	TODAY IS REALLY

41:43.014 --> 41:47.001

41:47.003 --> 41:49.005
I COULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS

41:47.003 --> 41:49.005
			WITHOUT YOU,

41:49.007 --> 41:53.025
			AND YOU HAVE MADE

41:49.007 --> 41:53.025
A REALLY BAD SITUATION INITIALLY

41:53.025 --> 41:56.005
		TURN OUT TO BE ABSOLUTE GOLD.

41:56.005 --> 41:57.025
		BUT I DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE

41:57.025 --> 42:00.010
			WE HAVE AN EMPLOYER/EMPLOYEE

41:57.025 --> 42:00.010
		RELATIONSHIP.

42:00.012 --> 42:02.014
	AND SO I REALLY WANT YOU

42:00.012 --> 42:02.014
TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING

42:02.014 --> 42:06.003
AND FEEL LIKE YOU'RE GOING

TO		 YOUR			 BUSINESS.

42:06.005 --> 42:09.010
		I WANT YOU TO HAVE 25%

42:06.005 --> 42:09.010
	OF THE BUSINESS WITH ME.

42:12.012 --> 42:14.021
		I'M HERE TO HELP YOU,

42:12.012 --> 42:14.021

42:14.023 --> 42:17.012
			IT'S CRAZY.

42:17.014 --> 42:18.021
Lemonis: WHY IS IT CRAZY?

42:18.023 --> 42:20.014
			Tammy: I DON'T HAVE

42:18.023 --> 42:20.014
	A BACHELORS ON THE WALL,

42:20.014 --> 42:22.003
AND I'M --

42:22.005 --> 42:25.023
LIKE, IT'S JUST --

42:22.005 --> 42:25.023

42:25.025 --> 42:29.010

TO GET BIGGER AND BETTER.
