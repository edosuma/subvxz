01:57.938 --> 01:59.940
Oh, what the fuck?

02:33.278 --> 02:36.148
What the fuck
is this shit?

02:36.150 --> 02:38.848
You've got to be
fucking kidding me!

04:08.155 --> 04:10.375
Help!
Somebody help!

04:29.437 --> 04:31.219
Fuck you!

04:33.746 --> 04:35.965
Help! Help!

05:06.343 --> 05:07.997
Have a look.

05:26.189 --> 05:28.017
Evening,
Mr. Kellum.

05:29.976 --> 05:33.327
I have a package in the back.
Fetch it for me.

06:08.580 --> 06:10.233
This way, sir.

06:25.292 --> 06:27.031
What the bloody hell
are they doing?

06:27.033 --> 06:29.165
Having a barbecue
or something?

06:31.733 --> 06:33.864
Find anything?

06:33.866 --> 06:36.477
No. There's no other way
into the place.

07:00.501 --> 07:01.761
Over there.

07:01.763 --> 07:03.417
Yes sir.

07:14.646 --> 07:16.952
Mr. Kellum?

07:18.432 --> 07:19.825
Send him in.

07:33.447 --> 07:36.058
Will there be anything
else, Mr. Kellum?

07:37.843 --> 07:39.888
- Privacy.
- Yes, sir.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.767
Kellum.

07:50.769 --> 07:52.682
Frederick Kellum.

07:52.684 --> 07:54.599
Such a pleasure
to meet you.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.083
Ah, yes.

08:19.711 --> 08:22.714
Allow me to introduce
my other guest to you.

09:01.622 --> 09:04.579
It's okay.
There, there.

09:04.581 --> 09:06.018
Shh.

09:09.238 --> 09:11.110
Hey. It's okay.

09:11.937 --> 09:13.808
I won't hurt you.

09:15.027 --> 09:16.506
Not anymore.

09:17.551 --> 09:19.333
No! No!

09:19.335 --> 09:21.988
No! No!

09:21.990 --> 09:24.384
Goodbye.

09:25.559 --> 09:27.213
Goodbye.

09:40.574 --> 09:42.141
She's all yours.

12:16.556 --> 12:19.513
- Hey, boys.
- Ma'am, you're supposed to park the van around back.

12:19.515 --> 12:21.820
Can I get one of you guys
to help me out?

12:21.822 --> 12:23.691
Van, around back!

12:23.693 --> 12:25.347
Please?
Just a second.

12:33.834 --> 12:35.138
What is this?

12:38.099 --> 12:39.709
Don't think so, mate.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.633
Oh, my.

12:57.684 --> 12:59.640
That smells...

12:59.642 --> 13:01.644
wonderful.

13:13.352 --> 13:15.702
Don't move.
Good lad.

13:18.226 --> 13:20.096
Sir,

13:20.098 --> 13:22.098
I need you to turn around
and leave the premises, please.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.665
- Sir, I need you to leave.
- Come on. Have a drink.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.408
I need you to leave, sir!

13:27.627 --> 13:29.324
Get out. Now.

13:38.029 --> 13:39.378
All right.

13:47.125 --> 13:50.432
- Get down! Get the fuck down!
- Oh, fuck!

13:51.694 --> 13:54.262
Oh, fuck! Oh!

13:57.135 --> 14:00.486
In you go,
with your other friends.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.924
Don't move, okay?

14:05.926 --> 14:07.536
I'm serious.

14:31.212 --> 14:34.257
Where the fuck
are you, Kyle?

14:53.321 --> 14:55.800
You have no idea

14:55.802 --> 14:59.545
how long it's been
since my last meal.

15:02.809 --> 15:04.898
Oh, God!

15:06.987 --> 15:08.989
You're an artist.

15:16.170 --> 15:18.259
Beautiful.

15:21.132 --> 15:22.655
Get down.

15:29.140 --> 15:30.837
Don't fucking move.

15:32.534 --> 15:34.797
- Is it clear?
- Yeah. Go.

15:54.426 --> 15:55.992
Back.

15:57.646 --> 15:58.995
Back!

16:08.179 --> 16:09.919
Put 'em down.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.023
Where is she?

16:32.377 --> 16:34.205
Where is she?

17:05.410 --> 17:07.673
Mickey! Mickey?

17:11.155 --> 17:12.634
What the fuck?

17:58.289 --> 17:59.812
Oh, shit.

18:01.292 --> 18:04.641
Kyle, are you okay?

18:04.643 --> 18:06.601
Yeah. I'm all right.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.283
Mickey?

19:08.968 --> 19:13.231
Hey.
She gonna be okay?

19:13.233 --> 19:15.494
- Hey. Mickey.
- Hmm?

19:15.496 --> 19:18.018
Is she gonna be okay?

19:18.020 --> 19:20.458
Yeah. Yeah, she'll be...
She'll be fine, mate.

19:22.373 --> 19:25.548
- You ever seen her like that?
- Sorry?

19:25.550 --> 19:28.030
Have you ever seen
her like that before?

19:29.554 --> 19:31.860
No. No, afraid not.

19:40.173 --> 19:42.956
How long y'all
known each other?

19:42.958 --> 19:44.958
Quite a while.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.700
Six or seven years,
I think.

19:47.702 --> 19:50.312
Sweet girl, really.

19:50.314 --> 19:53.619
I know you don't get to see
that side to her much, but...

19:53.621 --> 19:55.447
she is, I promise.

19:55.449 --> 19:58.320
- She's just been through a lot.
- Like tonight?

19:58.322 --> 20:00.234
Yeah.

20:00.236 --> 20:02.500
Too many nights like that,
I'm afraid.

20:16.427 --> 20:19.341
I think she's getting
worn out from it all.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.734
Can't say I blame her.

20:21.736 --> 20:23.695
Doesn't it get to you?

20:26.262 --> 20:27.873
Oh, yeah, it does.

20:29.091 --> 20:31.788
But I just look
at things differently.

20:31.790 --> 20:35.271
How so, if you don't
mind me asking?

20:36.316 --> 20:38.447
No worries.

20:38.449 --> 20:41.058
See, I knew when we went
looking for that girl,

20:41.060 --> 20:44.585
that when we found her,
she wasn't going to be alive.

20:46.065 --> 20:47.717
And I know that.
You know, I...

20:47.719 --> 20:51.416
It still hurts to a degree,
but I'm just...

20:51.418 --> 20:53.594
I'm just ready for it
when it comes, you know?

20:59.339 --> 21:01.165
She saved me.

21:01.167 --> 21:03.430
- I don't think I ever told you that.
- No.

21:04.475 --> 21:06.390
That's actually
how we met.

21:07.565 --> 21:10.653
I was kidnapped,
and she rescued me.

21:10.655 --> 21:13.482
- You serious?
- Oh, yeah.

21:13.484 --> 21:15.921
Awful, awful situation.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.662
Were you scared?

21:19.664 --> 21:23.405
Yeah, I was scared.
Bastard tied me to a chair.

21:23.407 --> 21:25.887
I was about to be fed
to his pit bulls.

21:27.149 --> 21:29.149
Pissed my pants.

21:29.151 --> 21:32.198
Anyway, things are
so different now, and...

21:33.504 --> 21:36.113
that's why
we don't have a dog.

21:36.115 --> 21:38.768
Anyway, that's a...

21:38.770 --> 21:40.946
that's a story
for another time.

21:41.990 --> 21:43.381
So where to now?

21:43.383 --> 21:46.732
Now we're gonna go
and see Deloris.

21:46.734 --> 21:49.779
- Mickey's mother?
- Foster mother.

21:49.781 --> 21:53.349
Now, don't forget that, or she'll remind
you in painful detail, believe me.

21:55.743 --> 21:57.961
Anyway, I'm, uh,

21:57.963 --> 22:00.703
turning in for the night.

22:00.705 --> 22:04.143
Just stay on this road.
In a few hours, one of us will take over.

23:52.773 --> 23:54.991
She's sleeping.

23:58.083 --> 24:00.126
Is that them?

24:00.128 --> 24:02.566
Yes, Mama.

24:13.751 --> 24:15.054
Hello, dear.

24:15.056 --> 24:16.926
Charles.

24:16.928 --> 24:19.058
Deloris, I'd like you
to meet our friend Kyle.

24:19.060 --> 24:22.671
- He's working with us now.
- Hi there, ma'am.

24:22.673 --> 24:24.805
Don't crowd me, boy!

24:25.980 --> 24:28.243
Okay.

24:29.114 --> 24:31.549
Where are you, Michelle?

24:31.551 --> 24:33.769
I'm here.

24:33.771 --> 24:35.903
Well, take my hand!

24:37.078 --> 24:38.819
No.

24:40.734 --> 24:42.821
We just came to give you
these and say goodbye.

24:42.823 --> 24:46.738
- Goodbye?
- There's really nothing else to say.

24:46.740 --> 24:49.741
You ungrateful
little wretch!

24:49.743 --> 24:52.311
Just stop. Do you want
to see them or not?

24:53.529 --> 24:55.009
Tell me you found her.

24:56.054 --> 24:57.662
What was left of her.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.577
You failed again?

24:59.579 --> 25:02.580
- Failed?
- Yes, failed!

25:02.582 --> 25:05.322
I gave you everything
you needed to find her,

25:05.324 --> 25:07.411
to save her,
and after all I give,

25:07.413 --> 25:09.197
you do nothing!

25:09.981 --> 25:12.068
You withered old hag,

25:12.070 --> 25:14.636
you have no idea
what happened.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.597
And you have no idea what they
went through, you little bitch!

25:19.033 --> 25:22.644
But I do, because God
shows me everything.

25:22.646 --> 25:26.212
God doesn't show you anything.
You're just a freak.

25:26.214 --> 25:27.953
Blasphemy!

25:27.955 --> 25:31.087
Oh, give me a break.

25:31.089 --> 25:33.916
You don't even care about them.
You're so selfish!

25:33.918 --> 25:37.397
You don't think
I tried?

25:39.706 --> 25:44.317
Tried?
Of course you tried.

25:44.319 --> 25:46.668
But you haven't
saved one...

25:46.670 --> 25:49.758
not one of the lives
God asked you to!

25:54.634 --> 25:57.809
I'm done.

25:57.811 --> 25:59.898
Done?

25:59.900 --> 26:02.031
Done?

26:02.033 --> 26:04.644
You never even got started.

26:14.045 --> 26:16.308
Can you see me,
old woman?

26:18.527 --> 26:20.616
What are you talking about?

26:21.922 --> 26:24.357
- You can't, can you?
- You know she can't.

26:24.359 --> 26:25.752
Shut up.

26:32.063 --> 26:35.629
Do you want to know why
you can't see me?

26:37.372 --> 26:39.374
Death is closing your eyes.

26:40.549 --> 26:43.115
Soon you won't
see anything.

26:43.117 --> 26:45.250
Not even your visions.

26:46.077 --> 26:47.729
All you'll see

26:47.731 --> 26:49.513
is the cold,

26:49.515 --> 26:51.558
dark loneliness

26:51.560 --> 26:53.822
of the grave.

26:53.824 --> 26:56.259
And honestly,

26:56.261 --> 26:58.827
you'd better hope
there's no God.

28:33.271 --> 28:34.968
Thanks, Mom.

28:36.665 --> 28:38.842
All right. go on.
I'll get you in the...

28:46.501 --> 28:49.853
- Mommy, help.
- Danny, I'll be right there.

28:51.158 --> 28:53.769
Mommy!

29:50.348 --> 29:53.784
Tina, what are
you doing here?

29:53.786 --> 29:55.699
It's Mom.

29:55.701 --> 29:58.658
She had another attack,
and she's not doing good.

29:58.660 --> 30:01.400
She... She won't
even talk to me.

30:01.402 --> 30:04.055
- She says won't talk to anybody but you.
- I don't...

30:04.057 --> 30:06.971
She said
it has to be you!

30:06.973 --> 30:08.801
Please!

30:12.283 --> 30:13.893
Hang on a minute.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.910
That you?

30:32.912 --> 30:35.086
I'm here.

30:35.088 --> 30:36.872
You came.

30:38.135 --> 30:40.528
Please, take my hand.

30:43.183 --> 30:44.748
Another vision.

30:44.750 --> 30:47.664
Why tell me?
I thought I was a failure.

30:47.666 --> 30:49.013
This is different.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.015
Like I believe you.

30:51.017 --> 30:53.844
- You have to believe me!
- Why?

30:53.846 --> 30:55.411
This is...

30:55.413 --> 30:58.370
this is the blackest soul
I've ever encountered.

30:58.372 --> 31:01.243
He's killed more
by himself

31:01.245 --> 31:04.986
and his things than nearly
all of them combined.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.596
Blacker than yours?

31:06.598 --> 31:09.555
Damn it, girl, stop it!

31:09.557 --> 31:12.558
I don't have time for this.
I don't have time for your feelings,

31:12.560 --> 31:15.257
and neither do they!

31:15.259 --> 31:18.521
I didn't ask
for these visions.

31:18.523 --> 31:21.656
I didn't want them!
They're a curse!

31:22.918 --> 31:26.094
A torment!
A torment from God

31:26.096 --> 31:29.314
made to put
you and I to work!

31:31.884 --> 31:33.362
You dragged me into this.

31:33.364 --> 31:36.321
Oh, you could've walked away
anytime you wanted!

31:36.323 --> 31:39.107
Could I?

31:39.109 --> 31:42.675
Oh, spare me
your bullshit.

31:42.677 --> 31:46.114
I at least know
everything I am.

31:46.116 --> 31:50.074
A part of you knows
you just love this.

31:52.296 --> 31:54.602
You've got nothing else!

32:00.521 --> 32:02.132
Not love.

32:03.176 --> 32:05.698
And if I have nothing else,

32:05.700 --> 32:09.267
it's because the woman that
was supposed to have raised me

32:09.269 --> 32:12.446
never let me believe
there wasanything else.

32:15.841 --> 32:18.713
A woman and her son, taken!

32:19.932 --> 32:22.759
- Th... They're still alive.
- Don't.

32:22.761 --> 32:26.893
Do you want to know what will happen to
that little boy before he kills them?

32:26.895 --> 32:29.940
Do you think he'll end up
in a pedophile dungeon?

32:29.942 --> 32:33.030
It's worse.

32:33.032 --> 32:36.251
Oh, God, it's worse.

32:36.253 --> 32:39.082
Fredrick Kellum
used this man.

32:40.300 --> 32:43.171
He brought
that girl to him.

32:43.173 --> 32:46.350
You know, the one that
ended up being barbecued?

32:47.873 --> 32:51.831
He's brought many victims
to a terrible end,

32:51.833 --> 32:54.791
or else he's handed
them over to butchers!

32:56.186 --> 32:59.100
I want to save them.

33:00.886 --> 33:05.193
Save them before
they fall under the knife.

33:07.980 --> 33:10.198
Oh, God!

33:10.200 --> 33:13.290
This isn't about you and me!

33:16.902 --> 33:19.165
Please save them!

33:22.037 --> 33:24.127
I need you.

33:25.040 --> 33:27.956
Oh, God, I need you.

33:57.856 --> 34:00.465
There's nothing on here about a
mother and son being kidnapped.

34:00.467 --> 34:02.119
Are you sure
she's not wrong?

34:02.121 --> 34:04.689
Deloris is never wrong
about this kind of thing.

34:09.083 --> 34:11.607
Who is he
on the phone with?

34:11.609 --> 34:14.304
Who is he on
the phone with, Mickey?

34:14.306 --> 34:15.871
One of our connections.

34:15.873 --> 34:19.572
Connections?
We have connections? Who?

34:21.184 --> 34:22.966
The F.B.I.

34:22.967 --> 34:25.228
I thought you said we were
supposed to stay away from cops.

34:25.231 --> 34:28.275
- We are.
- Could you explain yourself, Mickey?

34:28.277 --> 34:31.103
I'm getting really tired of this
"leave the new guy hanging"

34:31.106 --> 34:33.237
rookie bullshit.

34:35.241 --> 34:38.110
Deloris was part of a special
team before she went solo.

34:38.112 --> 34:40.592
The F.B.I. had a program
in the late '60s.

34:40.594 --> 34:42.290
Funded a lot
of psych research.

34:42.292 --> 34:46.163
Deloris was called in
on several major investigations.

34:46.165 --> 34:47.643
Like what?

34:47.645 --> 34:50.036
I never heard too much
about it from her.

34:50.038 --> 34:52.213
I know the program
shut down.

34:52.215 --> 34:54.431
The lead agent in charge,
he retired,

34:54.434 --> 34:57.043
started his own private
intelligence organization.

34:57.045 --> 34:59.132
Mom never told me
any of that.

34:59.134 --> 35:01.833
She didn't tell
you a lot of things.

35:03.269 --> 35:06.227
Well, why and how
is this gonna help us?

35:06.229 --> 35:08.403
We're hoping that someone
they're affiliated with

35:08.405 --> 35:11.014
has a backlog of the 911 calls
in South Carolina.

35:11.016 --> 35:13.321
We don't even know
where we're looking.

35:13.323 --> 35:15.627
Yeah, but there couldn't have been
too many mother-and-son kidnappings

35:15.629 --> 35:17.803
in the last 24 hours.

35:17.805 --> 35:19.805
If it was outside a residence,
then somebody might've spotted it.

35:19.807 --> 35:23.420
So if she's right,
and we find this place, what then?

35:24.943 --> 35:26.640
That's where you come in.

35:28.599 --> 35:31.121
They're gonna call us back.

35:31.123 --> 35:33.952
We can at least start heading
towards the Carolinas.

35:39.174 --> 35:40.872
Get off the counter.

35:58.629 --> 36:01.325
He's gonna be back any fucking minute.
I know it.

36:01.327 --> 36:03.980
- Calm down!
- Shut up! It's my fucking turn.

36:03.982 --> 36:06.765
- Calm down!
- Any fucking minute.

36:06.767 --> 36:09.117
Okay? It's my fucking turn.

36:11.032 --> 36:12.295
Hey.

36:13.426 --> 36:16.647
Hey, are you awake?

36:17.909 --> 36:20.170
Shh! Settle down.

36:20.172 --> 36:21.693
Shh! Stop!

36:21.695 --> 36:23.652
Stop! Stop it!

36:23.654 --> 36:26.307
My son! Where's...
God, where's my son?

36:26.309 --> 36:29.179
- Shut up!
- They took my son.

36:29.181 --> 36:31.399
It's okay.
What's your name?

36:31.401 --> 36:34.315
It's Brooke.
But they took my son.

36:34.317 --> 36:35.968
- Where is...
- Shut the fuck up!

36:35.970 --> 36:37.796
Shh!

36:37.798 --> 36:41.060
Brooke, you have got
to listen to me.

36:41.062 --> 36:43.019
Where is he?

36:43.021 --> 36:45.238
Oh, fuck!

36:45.240 --> 36:49.417
- Oh, fuck!
- Shh! Shh! Don't say anything!

37:23.191 --> 37:24.628
Fuck!

37:25.455 --> 37:26.715
Listen, man! Fuck!

37:26.717 --> 37:28.586
You don't want to
fucking do this!

37:28.588 --> 37:32.200
Please! Fuck. Fuck.
Please, please...

37:39.817 --> 37:43.342
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
Get off!

38:40.007 --> 38:43.139
- Is this the place?
- Yeah, this is it.

38:43.141 --> 38:45.491
Doesn't seem like
anybody's home.

38:47.537 --> 38:49.234
Well, let's go.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.021
Anything?

38:56.546 --> 38:57.982
No.

39:01.159 --> 39:03.464
That didn't seem
entirely truthful.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.119
No, it didn't.

39:09.428 --> 39:11.950
- Well, Tina?
- "Well" what?

39:11.952 --> 39:13.778
Don't bullshit me.
What do you see?

39:13.780 --> 39:15.911
I don't see anything!

39:15.913 --> 39:17.826
You little snot!

39:17.828 --> 39:19.697
What do you want
from me?

39:19.699 --> 39:21.699
I didn't ask to be
a part of this.

39:21.701 --> 39:25.224
- Nobody made you come.
- Like I had a choice!

39:25.226 --> 39:28.358
Get some, uh...
Get some from the sides

39:28.360 --> 39:30.360
and around there as well.

39:30.362 --> 39:33.363
- They usually like this?
- Yeah. Yeah, they're like this a lot.

39:33.365 --> 39:35.626
Really, really boring
after a while.

39:35.628 --> 39:39.717
Being in that Winnebago, all you hear is,
"wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah," you know?

39:39.719 --> 39:41.153
Drives me mad.

39:41.155 --> 39:43.025
God, you're turning
into her!

39:43.027 --> 39:45.593
Don't play that "wounded
little girl" shit with me.

39:45.595 --> 39:47.595
Whatever, Mickey.

39:47.597 --> 39:50.467
You don't know what it's been like
living with her since you left.

39:50.469 --> 39:53.035
Damn it, I don't want
to be here either,

39:53.037 --> 39:55.646
but there are
people's lives at stake.

39:55.648 --> 39:57.650
Do you understand that?

40:00.479 --> 40:03.395
Who the hell are y'all,
and what are you doing here?

40:06.180 --> 40:07.486
Come on.

40:10.141 --> 40:12.837
- Are you with the police?
- No, we're more, uh,

40:12.839 --> 40:15.579
federal...
federal agents.

40:15.581 --> 40:18.495
- I tried calling you!
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry about that,

40:18.497 --> 40:20.236
but you probably
called the police.

40:20.238 --> 40:22.934
We're federal agents,
so... it's different.

40:22.936 --> 40:24.632
My daughter's missin'!

40:24.634 --> 40:27.635
Do you not get that?
My daughter is missin'!

40:27.637 --> 40:31.247
Let me tell you this now.
Your mother doesn't have long.

40:31.249 --> 40:33.945
When she goes, what are
you gonna do then, huh?

40:33.947 --> 40:36.121
If you can't be
of any use to us,

40:36.123 --> 40:37.862
we'll drop you off
at the nearest bus station.

40:37.864 --> 40:40.212
You can figure out
your own damn life from there.

40:40.214 --> 40:42.258
I don't have time
for this shit.

40:42.260 --> 40:45.263
And that woman and son,
they don't have time for it either.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.353
Mickey, wait.

40:49.397 --> 40:51.484
I don't want to find them.

40:51.486 --> 40:53.835
- You what?
- ...information, that's all.

40:53.837 --> 40:56.707
And if there's anything you can tell
us, that would be...

40:56.709 --> 40:58.404
that would be great,
you know?

40:58.406 --> 40:59.971
I don't want to find them.

40:59.973 --> 41:02.321
- The mother and son?
- Yes!

41:02.323 --> 41:05.718
- You don't want to help them?
- No, I just...

41:07.677 --> 41:09.590
You're afraid.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.681
You should be too!

41:13.987 --> 41:15.683
What do you see?

41:15.685 --> 41:18.686
I don't...

41:18.688 --> 41:20.428
Don't what?

41:21.691 --> 41:23.691
He took her.

41:23.693 --> 41:24.953
Who are they?

41:24.955 --> 41:27.346
Uh, they're our colleagues.

41:27.348 --> 41:30.177
- Fellow detectives.
- Fellow detectives, yeah.

41:31.396 --> 41:33.701
Who? Who took her?

41:33.703 --> 41:35.313
That man.

41:36.575 --> 41:38.662
They took her!

41:38.664 --> 41:40.884
They took her
right over there!

41:41.928 --> 41:44.015
Who the hell are y'all?

41:44.017 --> 41:45.756
Uh...

41:45.758 --> 41:48.282
I want to see your ID's.

41:49.675 --> 41:53.068
Okay, that's our cue.
Let's go.

41:53.070 --> 41:55.984
Who are you?
You're not the police!

41:55.986 --> 41:59.552
- What do you see? What else do you see?
- Mickey, time to go.

41:59.554 --> 42:02.991
Oh, God! Oh, God!
What have you done with my daughter?

42:02.993 --> 42:05.080
Quickly.
What else do you see?

42:05.082 --> 42:06.736
There was a woman.

42:08.302 --> 42:09.911
He was screaming.

42:09.913 --> 42:12.043
They hit her head on
the van right over there.

42:12.045 --> 42:13.871
Mickey, now. Come on.

42:13.873 --> 42:16.006
Okay. Let's go.

42:19.444 --> 42:22.314
Great. All that woman has to say now...
her daughter and grandson

42:22.316 --> 42:24.752
were kidnapped by
four people in a Winnebago.

42:24.754 --> 42:27.580
- We won't be able to get anywhere.
- Just go, fast.

42:27.582 --> 42:30.368
The Country Squire is hardly the
most inconspicuous of vehicles.

42:35.503 --> 42:37.068
Federal agent?

42:37.070 --> 42:40.813
Well, better
than MI6, I thought.

42:49.126 --> 42:51.389
Did she get the photos?

42:53.217 --> 42:55.565
Uh-huh.

42:55.567 --> 42:57.090
And what'd the doctor say?

43:01.747 --> 43:03.660
No.

43:03.662 --> 43:05.055
Thank you.

43:14.107 --> 43:16.934
Deloris?

43:16.936 --> 43:19.676
I don't think she's gonna be
with us on this one.

43:19.678 --> 43:21.114
Dead?

43:22.246 --> 43:24.028
She had another attack.

43:24.030 --> 43:26.814
- An attack?
- It's from the visions.

43:26.816 --> 43:30.078
The more intense ones
make her heart beat too fast.

43:30.080 --> 43:33.995
So what do we do now?
Go with Tina?

43:33.997 --> 43:35.257
How is she?

43:35.259 --> 43:36.956
Asleep.

43:39.306 --> 43:41.045
Let her sleep.

43:41.047 --> 43:43.047
We're gonna be asking
a lot of her when she gets up.

43:43.049 --> 43:45.267
Like she's gonna
be any use.

43:45.269 --> 43:48.444
You know, we've been driving around
on a hunch all day for nothing.

43:48.446 --> 43:50.359
You got a better idea?

43:50.361 --> 43:53.057
Yeah. Yeah,
I got a better idea.

43:53.059 --> 43:55.540
Fuck that.
I'm going for a bite.

43:56.759 --> 43:58.412
All right?

44:21.827 --> 44:23.653
You hungry?

44:23.655 --> 44:25.483
No, you go on.

44:27.877 --> 44:30.357
So how'd you get
into all this, Mickey?

44:32.446 --> 44:35.099
You've been waiting a while
to ask me that, haven't you?

44:35.101 --> 44:37.974
- You don't have to. I just...
- That's all right.

44:41.238 --> 44:45.414
My real parents died
when I was four.

44:45.416 --> 44:49.246
I bounced around foster home
to foster home until...

44:50.856 --> 44:53.291
Deloris took me in.

44:53.293 --> 44:55.903
That was my 12th birthday.

44:55.905 --> 44:58.037
What was that like?

44:59.560 --> 45:02.039
Well, Tina was
just a baby then.

45:02.041 --> 45:05.695
Deloris had married
this private detective.

45:05.697 --> 45:08.567
A real asshole,
and a drunk.

45:08.569 --> 45:11.834
They were hunters then
like we are now.

45:15.359 --> 45:17.578
Doesn't sound like fun.

45:18.710 --> 45:20.886
No. It wasn't.

45:22.105 --> 45:25.499
I was never really
a daughter to them.

45:26.631 --> 45:28.720
I was more like the help.

45:29.808 --> 45:32.374
Tina's Father,
Deloris's husband,

45:32.376 --> 45:34.593
was killed on a hunt
when I was 15.

45:34.595 --> 45:36.117
How'd it happen?

45:36.119 --> 45:37.990
I wasn't there.

45:39.774 --> 45:41.774
All I remember was...

45:41.776 --> 45:44.342
Deloris's reaction.

45:44.344 --> 45:47.824
After that,
Tina got what was left

45:47.826 --> 45:50.392
of the tenderness.

45:50.394 --> 45:53.569
I got the anger

45:53.571 --> 45:55.399
and bitterness.

45:56.443 --> 45:58.966
So why didn't
you just leave?

45:58.968 --> 46:02.534
I tried, several times.

46:02.536 --> 46:05.189
Whenever I ran,
she'd track me down,

46:05.191 --> 46:07.191
tell me she needed me.

46:07.193 --> 46:10.891
After a while,
I just accepted it.

46:10.893 --> 46:12.414
How?

46:12.416 --> 46:15.417
How would you accept
something like that?

46:15.419 --> 46:16.984
I don't know.

46:16.986 --> 46:19.249
I don't know anymore.

46:20.990 --> 46:23.122
There's just so much...

46:24.080 --> 46:27.257
pain in this job.

46:29.737 --> 46:32.175
Few tangible rewards.

46:38.529 --> 46:40.790
Look at me go on.

46:40.792 --> 46:44.448
That's the most you've ever said
in the whole time I've known you.

46:46.580 --> 46:49.148
Well, now you know
why I don't talk about it.

46:51.020 --> 46:53.587
You've got a lot
weighing on you.

46:54.371 --> 46:56.937
More than I thought.

46:56.939 --> 46:59.026
It's no way to live.

46:59.028 --> 47:02.246
It's no way
to live, Mickey.

47:02.248 --> 47:03.771
It's not.

47:04.642 --> 47:08.078
It's not a life, but...

47:08.080 --> 47:11.647
I've never had
one of those.

47:11.649 --> 47:14.913
- Where are you going?
- I just need a walk.

47:56.215 --> 47:58.128
Can I get you
something, sugar?

47:58.130 --> 48:00.089
- Uh, just a water.
- Sure thing.

48:06.399 --> 48:08.314
Are you mad at me?

48:09.098 --> 48:10.969
No, I'm not mad.

48:11.970 --> 48:13.796
You are mad.

48:13.798 --> 48:15.972
Well,
what happens next?

48:15.974 --> 48:18.148
Let's say we find
this mother and son.

48:18.150 --> 48:20.890
You know, alive if we're
lucky, barbecued if we're not.

48:20.892 --> 48:23.632
Then what?
Just call it a day?

48:23.634 --> 48:26.941
"Jolly good show, everyone. Don't let the
camper door hit you on the ass on the way out."

48:28.160 --> 48:29.899
You've been drinking
too much.

48:29.901 --> 48:31.642
Have I?

48:34.384 --> 48:35.907
Have I?

48:38.475 --> 48:40.910
Have you... Have you
even thought about

48:40.912 --> 48:43.436
what would happen
if you give this all up?

48:45.090 --> 48:48.004
Yes.
I've thought about it.

48:48.006 --> 48:49.660
And?

48:52.010 --> 48:54.793
And I have no idea.

48:54.795 --> 48:57.581
I have no idea
where I'd go.

49:37.534 --> 49:40.276
- You bastard!
- Brooke, don't!

49:42.582 --> 49:45.192
What have you done with my son,
you piece of shit?

49:45.194 --> 49:47.194
Where is he?

49:47.196 --> 49:50.503
I swear to God if you have
hurt him I'll kill you myself!

50:09.566 --> 50:13.742
No! No! Stop!

50:36.680 --> 50:38.203
Fuck you!

51:26.947 --> 51:29.515
No! No!

51:44.182 --> 51:47.139
She gonna be of any use,
do you think?

51:47.141 --> 51:49.579
I hope
she'll come through.

51:50.841 --> 51:53.276
I have
a question for you.

51:53.278 --> 51:56.366
Does it matter to you
if we save them, this...

51:56.368 --> 51:58.588
this mother and her son?

52:00.590 --> 52:02.459
Does it to you?

52:02.461 --> 52:04.418
Yeah.

52:04.420 --> 52:06.289
It should.

52:06.291 --> 52:09.423
But we haven't saved much
of anyone in a while, have we?

52:09.425 --> 52:13.383
You know, I just realized
recently that...

52:13.385 --> 52:16.343
you know, we're not here
to save anybody. I mean...

52:16.345 --> 52:18.997
of course, we try,
and we should,

52:18.999 --> 52:22.218
but it's not like we have much
to say on the matter, is it.

52:22.220 --> 52:23.872
We don't.

52:23.874 --> 52:26.137
So, it's not really
much for them. It's...

52:28.444 --> 52:31.838
for those that might become the next victims
if we let these bastards keep going.

52:34.493 --> 52:36.582
And the others just....

52:43.372 --> 52:46.634
You know,
we're no rescuers, Mickey.

52:46.636 --> 52:49.291
We just take out
the trash when we can.

53:01.390 --> 53:04.260
I'm sorry, Charles.

53:04.262 --> 53:06.090
What for?

53:08.614 --> 53:11.138
For you feeling
that way...

53:13.706 --> 53:15.926
and for it being true.

53:17.362 --> 53:19.536
You know, I've got...

53:19.538 --> 53:22.365
something to tell you,
and I know this is...

53:22.367 --> 53:25.239
not the most appropriate
place, but...

53:26.153 --> 53:28.153
Okay.

53:28.155 --> 53:30.547
I've been thinking about this
for a long time, and...

53:32.986 --> 53:35.293
I know you might not
want to hear it, but...

53:37.861 --> 53:39.295
I have to tell you before...

53:41.255 --> 53:43.343
this is all over and...

53:43.345 --> 53:46.130
Excuse me, hon.
Is that y'all's friend out there?

53:50.352 --> 53:51.875
Oh, God.

53:56.358 --> 53:57.663
Shit.

54:01.624 --> 54:03.580
Tina, are you okay?

54:03.582 --> 54:05.495
He was here!

54:05.497 --> 54:09.238
- What?
- Him, the man, the one you're looking for.

54:09.240 --> 54:11.980
He was here!

54:11.982 --> 54:14.722
She just woke up,
started screaming and crying.

54:14.724 --> 54:16.419
What do you mean,
he was here?

54:16.421 --> 54:18.073
When was he here?
Where?

54:18.075 --> 54:20.423
Here, in this place.

54:20.425 --> 54:23.818
I see him everywhere.
He comes here all the time.

54:23.820 --> 54:26.995
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

54:26.997 --> 54:30.346
He comes here.
He drives right by in his van,

54:30.348 --> 54:32.261
and nobody ever knows.

54:32.263 --> 54:35.525
He has bodies in the back,
and nobody ever knows.

54:35.527 --> 54:37.571
Would make sense.

54:37.573 --> 54:39.703
Right next to one of the
biggest highways in the state.

54:39.705 --> 54:41.357
Practically right off
the exit.

54:41.359 --> 54:44.229
If he comes here often,
he could live nearby.

54:44.231 --> 54:46.623
I could see if
somebody knows him.

54:46.625 --> 54:50.497
You said you know where,
what he looks like?

54:50.499 --> 54:52.499
Yes.

54:52.501 --> 54:55.068
He's tall and big.

54:55.895 --> 54:57.678
What else?

54:57.680 --> 55:00.942
He has long hair and
tattoos down his left arm.

55:00.944 --> 55:03.379
Anything else?
We need to know where he is!

55:03.381 --> 55:05.076
I know, damn it!

55:05.078 --> 55:08.125
I don't know
where he lives!

55:18.396 --> 55:20.309
Of all the places,
in the state

55:20.311 --> 55:23.051
we happen upon
the one joint he comes to.

55:31.235 --> 55:33.411
What do you want to do?

55:36.109 --> 55:38.501
We got to go
looking for them.

55:38.503 --> 55:40.285
You mean right now?

55:40.287 --> 55:43.639
We don't know how much time
they have, Charles.

55:51.734 --> 55:53.821
Lady at the bar
says she's seen him.

55:53.823 --> 55:55.823
Comes here maybe
once or twice a week.

55:55.825 --> 55:58.044
She hasn't seen
him in a few days.

56:00.046 --> 56:02.527
Kyle, you got to get a car.

56:04.050 --> 56:06.181
Take some of the cash.

56:06.183 --> 56:08.139
See if you can borrow the
bartender's truck or something.

56:08.141 --> 56:10.054
All right.

56:10.056 --> 56:11.971
What are you thinking?

56:13.407 --> 56:15.973
I'm thinking if he lives nearby,
we need to split up.

56:15.975 --> 56:18.628
What are we supposed to do?
Just drive around aimlessly?

56:18.630 --> 56:21.936
You know, looking for a black van with
horns, driven by a large, tattooed man?

56:21.938 --> 56:23.853
Yes, but not you.

56:25.768 --> 56:28.161
What, you want me
to stay here?

56:29.511 --> 56:32.120
Tina, I need you
to come with me.

56:32.122 --> 56:35.210
I don't
want to go with you!

56:35.212 --> 56:37.952
Please, you don't know
what he's like.

56:37.954 --> 56:41.259
You don't know
what he does. Please!

56:41.261 --> 56:43.914
You don't have
to go near him.

56:43.916 --> 56:45.829
I just need you
to come with me

56:45.831 --> 56:48.571
to see if you can
help me find him.

56:48.573 --> 56:50.270
Okay?

56:53.273 --> 56:56.146
Okay? Okay.

56:59.845 --> 57:01.541
Carol?

57:01.543 --> 57:03.630
Carol?
Goddamn it!

57:03.632 --> 57:06.371
I don't want
to be here!

57:06.373 --> 57:09.246
Just let me
out of here!

57:13.816 --> 57:16.512
Oh, God! No! No, no, no!
Don't! Please!

57:24.043 --> 57:26.348
- What about Deloris?
- I'm gonna keep trying her.

57:26.350 --> 57:28.872
This is not smart, Mickey,
and you know it... splitting the team up.

57:28.874 --> 57:30.787
We should
stick together.

57:30.789 --> 57:32.876
We got lucky with this place.
Let's not risk everything.

57:32.878 --> 57:36.012
You want to miss
him coming here?

57:37.100 --> 57:38.449
No.

57:45.674 --> 57:47.978
This is just
a scouting trip.

57:47.980 --> 57:50.328
If you see him,
don't make a move.

57:50.330 --> 57:53.288
But if we find him, we'll come back
and get you before we do anything.

57:53.290 --> 57:54.898
Okay.

57:54.900 --> 57:57.292
Tell Kyle to cover
East of the highway.

57:57.294 --> 57:59.424
We're headed this way.

57:59.426 --> 58:00.732
Be careful.

58:01.690 --> 58:03.126
You too.

58:04.954 --> 58:07.086
See you later.

58:36.725 --> 58:38.291
All right.
Take care.

58:39.118 --> 58:41.207
Behave.

59:04.230 --> 59:06.187
Is everything
all right, friend?

59:06.189 --> 59:07.928
Yeah.

59:07.930 --> 59:09.671
Yeah, everything's fine.

59:11.194 --> 59:13.194
Hey, uh, thanks for
letting us use your truck.

59:13.196 --> 59:15.805
That was most kind of you.
Thank you.

59:15.807 --> 59:18.199
Well, your friend offered me
a really nice price,

59:18.201 --> 59:20.070
and Lord knows
I could use the money.

59:20.072 --> 59:22.596
Good deal for you, then.

59:46.925 --> 59:48.664
No!

01:00:01.766 --> 01:00:04.027
Can I get you a drink?

01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:06.116
Yes. Yes, please.
That'd be great.

01:00:06.118 --> 01:00:08.381
Okay.
Coming right up.

01:01:02.305 --> 01:01:04.827
- Here you are, hon.
- Thanks, love.

01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:06.483
Cheers.

01:01:23.195 --> 01:01:25.674
What? What?

01:01:25.676 --> 01:01:27.458
No, no, no, no,
no, no! No!

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:29.069
No! No! No!

01:01:29.071 --> 01:01:30.899
No! No!

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:35.555
No. No.

01:01:37.122 --> 01:01:40.169
God! No!
Please! Let me go!

01:01:41.692 --> 01:01:43.825
Don't you touch her!

01:02:07.283 --> 01:02:09.065
What are you doing?

01:02:09.067 --> 01:02:10.764
Stay away from her!

01:02:14.899 --> 01:02:17.206
Don't you touch her!

01:02:18.163 --> 01:02:20.294
Carol,
it's gonna be okay!

01:02:20.296 --> 01:02:23.036
It's okay, Carol!
Don't!

01:02:23.038 --> 01:02:25.214
Don't touch her!
No!

01:02:26.955 --> 01:02:29.131
No!

01:02:37.182 --> 01:02:39.663
Stop!
You son of a bitch!

01:02:43.536 --> 01:02:45.145
What are you doing?

01:02:45.147 --> 01:02:47.323
You stay away
from her!

01:02:59.683 --> 01:03:03.119
Carol! Carol, look at me!
Carol, look at me!

01:03:03.121 --> 01:03:06.775
It's gonna be okay. God, Carol!
Carol! Look at me, Carol.

01:03:06.777 --> 01:03:10.083
- Carol! No!
- No. Please stop.

01:03:10.085 --> 01:03:13.521
- What are you doing? What's he gonna do?
- You son of a bitch!

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:15.133
I can't breathe.

01:03:28.233 --> 01:03:30.842
It's gonna be okay!

01:03:30.844 --> 01:03:33.889
It's okay, Carol.
Don't!

01:03:33.891 --> 01:03:36.022
Oh, God, Carol!

01:03:37.112 --> 01:03:39.592
Oh, God!
No! God, Carol.

01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:44.421
Just breathe.
It's okay.

01:03:49.515 --> 01:03:51.648
Stop! Stop! No!

01:03:56.044 --> 01:03:57.957
God, no!

01:03:57.959 --> 01:03:59.697
No! No!

01:04:04.008 --> 01:04:05.879
No! Stop it! No!

01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:21.850
You son of a bitch!

01:04:21.852 --> 01:04:24.594
- No!
- My God! Carol.

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:41.263
Good night, sweetheart.

01:04:42.438 --> 01:04:45.047
It's gonna be okay.
Just look at me.

01:04:45.049 --> 01:04:48.618
- Just look at me. It's okay.
- Oh, God!

01:05:07.376 --> 01:05:09.334
Please! No!

01:05:12.685 --> 01:05:15.340
Please, Carol. No.

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:34.069
Rise and shine, sweetie.

01:06:34.071 --> 01:06:36.332
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:06:36.334 --> 01:06:38.726
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop. Shh.

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:41.163
Shh. There.

01:06:41.165 --> 01:06:43.426
Okay.

01:06:43.428 --> 01:06:45.863
You're okay.
You know what?

01:06:45.865 --> 01:06:47.517
It's okay.

01:06:47.519 --> 01:06:49.824
So, what we're gonna
do here is,

01:06:49.826 --> 01:06:52.914
we're gonna sit and wait for
my boyfriend to come back down.

01:06:52.916 --> 01:06:55.353
He's upstairs
getting something.

01:06:56.876 --> 01:06:59.747
Where'd you say
it was again, puddin'?

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:03.490
It's on the counter
by the woodblock, honey.

01:07:03.492 --> 01:07:06.797
He always forgets
where we keep it.

01:07:19.682 --> 01:07:21.640
- You okay, honey?
- Uh-huh.

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.735
Oh. Where are
my manners?

01:07:31.737 --> 01:07:33.868
Would you like a piece?

01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:36.438
Gum. Would you like
a gumball?

01:07:43.836 --> 01:07:46.533
I take that as a no.

01:07:46.535 --> 01:07:49.927
You know,
nobody ever says yes.

01:07:49.929 --> 01:07:53.279
I guess gum isn't exactly
what you're looking for

01:07:53.281 --> 01:07:55.935
in a situation
like this, is it?

01:07:59.069 --> 01:08:02.244
You know,
when I was a boy...

01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:08.337
...my parents took me with
them to go car shopping.

01:08:08.339 --> 01:08:11.949
One of those big ol' lots
full of cars...

01:08:11.951 --> 01:08:13.779
and trucks...

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.260
vans.

01:08:17.566 --> 01:08:20.131
Balloons!

01:08:20.133 --> 01:08:23.178
I started wondering around
while my parents were talking

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:25.399
to the damn salesman.

01:08:26.705 --> 01:08:29.576
Of course, I got lost.

01:08:29.578 --> 01:08:32.187
Running all over
that place, screaming,

01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:35.453
"Mommy! Mommy!"

01:08:37.455 --> 01:08:39.890
Started running down
them rows of cars.

01:08:39.892 --> 01:08:42.153
No, vans.

01:08:42.154 --> 01:08:45.243
Excuse me.
Rows of big ol' vans,

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:47.724
way over my head.

01:08:47.725 --> 01:08:52.120
And as I'm running
in between 'em,

01:08:52.122 --> 01:08:55.386
I'm heading towards a busy
highway on the other side.

01:08:56.822 --> 01:08:59.345
Like a chicken
with its head cut off.

01:08:59.346 --> 01:09:01.218
Not even thinkin'.

01:09:02.479 --> 01:09:05.265
Just trying to find
my head.

01:09:07.050 --> 01:09:09.877
My mommy. Anyway,

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:12.923
while I was
running down that row,

01:09:12.925 --> 01:09:16.451
I slipped
on a cracked gumball.

01:09:18.801 --> 01:09:20.671
Skinned my knees.

01:09:23.587 --> 01:09:26.024
But that gumball
saved my life, you know?

01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:29.505
See, there was a truck

01:09:29.506 --> 01:09:31.594
came whipping down
the other side of the road

01:09:31.595 --> 01:09:33.468
just after I fell.

01:09:40.038 --> 01:09:42.781
Would've splattered my brains
flatter than this.

01:09:44.087 --> 01:09:45.609
Sure as shit.

01:09:49.832 --> 01:09:51.790
It was fate!

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:56.012
And I believe that.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.621
Just like it was fate

01:09:58.623 --> 01:10:01.972
that brought you
and your friends

01:10:01.974 --> 01:10:05.238
to our fine establishment
here tonight.

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:09.066
Of all the bars in town

01:10:09.068 --> 01:10:11.591
that you could've
stopped at, sweetheart,

01:10:11.593 --> 01:10:14.463
you stopped at ours.

01:10:14.465 --> 01:10:17.814
And of all the people
you could've been looking for,

01:10:17.816 --> 01:10:20.382
turns out
it's a friend of ours.

01:10:20.384 --> 01:10:22.819
Well, it's an acquaintance,
really, but...

01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:25.868
somebody that we have
a vested interest in.

01:10:28.305 --> 01:10:31.088
- My goodness. He's trying to escape.
- Go help him, honey.

01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:33.789
Oh, my. Oh, my heaven.

01:10:37.053 --> 01:10:38.618
- I got it.
- Help him there, hon.

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:40.837
- Wait, now.
- There you go.

01:10:40.839 --> 01:10:42.624
Now you can see.

01:10:44.582 --> 01:10:47.368
Calm down.
There we go.

01:10:50.283 --> 01:10:52.240
Now, you see,

01:10:52.242 --> 01:10:54.416
my point is,

01:10:54.418 --> 01:10:58.335
you're the one that's running
down them rows of cars and trucks,

01:10:59.554 --> 01:11:01.469
looking for something.

01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:06.517
But you ain't gonna
trip over no gumball.

01:11:08.345 --> 01:11:11.653
You ain't gonna
save yourself. No.

01:11:14.482 --> 01:11:16.699
My friend,

01:11:16.701 --> 01:11:18.529
today...

01:11:19.791 --> 01:11:21.922
you're gonna get hit

01:11:21.924 --> 01:11:24.274
by one heck
of a big truck.

01:11:28.496 --> 01:11:31.410
The man
you're looking for

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:34.717
has three very peculiar
little pets.

01:11:34.719 --> 01:11:36.893
They're not really little.

01:11:36.895 --> 01:11:39.505
Maybe not little.

01:11:39.507 --> 01:11:42.246
but aside from his woman,

01:11:42.248 --> 01:11:44.988
we're the only ones privileged
enough to work with them.

01:11:48.559 --> 01:11:50.387
There he is.

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:03.746
You see, we have
an arrangement.

01:12:03.748 --> 01:12:07.097
His little pets
have a real appetite

01:12:07.099 --> 01:12:08.884
for folks just like you.

01:12:09.841 --> 01:12:11.885
And so every now and then,

01:12:11.887 --> 01:12:14.365
we supply him
with a good meal,

01:12:14.367 --> 01:12:16.716
and we get to watch.

01:12:16.718 --> 01:12:19.329
It's not really personal.

01:12:21.331 --> 01:12:24.463
So, I'm gonna spare you
this, at least.

01:12:24.465 --> 01:12:26.205
Let me see.

01:13:57.645 --> 01:13:59.427
Mickey?

01:13:59.429 --> 01:14:01.647
Yeah?

01:14:01.649 --> 01:14:04.563
What are we gonna do
when we find him?

01:14:04.565 --> 01:14:07.829
We're gonna find
that woman and her son.

01:14:09.091 --> 01:14:11.395
But what about him?

01:14:11.397 --> 01:14:14.400
What are we gonna do
about him and his things?

01:14:15.227 --> 01:14:16.794
What things?

01:14:18.056 --> 01:14:19.752
Damn it, Tina,
if you know something...

01:14:19.754 --> 01:14:21.494
I don't!

01:14:35.683 --> 01:14:37.162
Shit.

01:14:48.173 --> 01:14:50.565
- Whoo! It's hot!
- All right, all right.

01:14:50.567 --> 01:14:52.088
Quit, now!

01:15:05.713 --> 01:15:07.671
Go around back.

01:15:31.086 --> 01:15:33.477
I'm sorry, sugar,
but we're closed right now.

01:15:33.479 --> 01:15:35.960
Is there something
I can help you with?

01:16:29.405 --> 01:16:32.014
You shot my leg,
you bitch!

01:16:32.016 --> 01:16:34.016
You bitch!

01:16:40.372 --> 01:16:42.938
I'm gonna ask
you this one time.

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:44.984
Where's Charles?

01:16:44.986 --> 01:16:46.639
Fuck you!

01:16:55.474 --> 01:16:57.085
Where's Charles?

01:16:58.434 --> 01:17:00.784
- Who?
- Stop right there!

01:17:04.396 --> 01:17:06.832
Hold up, bitch!

01:17:06.834 --> 01:17:08.921
Real slow like.

01:17:10.228 --> 01:17:12.100
Now, hand that gun
over to her!

01:17:13.275 --> 01:17:14.970
Do it
or I'll shoot her.

01:17:14.972 --> 01:17:17.451
I'm sorry! Mickey!

01:17:17.453 --> 01:17:20.671
- Please!
- Shut up.

01:17:20.673 --> 01:17:23.283
- I swear I'll shoot her.
- Oh, God!

01:17:23.285 --> 01:17:26.634
Just do it, bitch!
Do it!

01:17:26.636 --> 01:17:30.335
- Please!
- Do it you cunting bitch! Do it!

01:17:31.946 --> 01:17:33.774
Do it you bitch!

01:17:35.558 --> 01:17:37.734
Oh no!

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.480
No! No!

01:17:50.181 --> 01:17:51.574
No!

01:17:54.969 --> 01:17:57.754
No, please!

01:17:58.755 --> 01:18:00.017
Please, no!

01:18:03.064 --> 01:18:04.674
No!

01:18:51.155 --> 01:18:52.765
Is this the place?

01:18:55.116 --> 01:18:57.551
The van's not here yet,

01:18:57.553 --> 01:19:00.249
but the lights have been on in
several rooms since I've been here.

01:19:00.251 --> 01:19:03.122
- Have you seen him yet?
- No.

01:19:03.124 --> 01:19:04.821
But someone's in there.

01:19:07.911 --> 01:19:09.608
Let's go.

01:19:12.916 --> 01:19:14.396
Be careful.

01:20:00.572 --> 01:20:02.357
No! No!

01:20:48.359 --> 01:20:49.752
Hello?

01:20:53.843 --> 01:20:55.453
Hello?

01:20:59.414 --> 01:21:01.936
Hello? If there's anyone
in there, we're here to help.

01:21:01.938 --> 01:21:04.243
Hello, hello!
I'm here! I'm in here!

01:21:04.245 --> 01:21:06.767
Shut up. Is there anyone else
in there with you?

01:21:06.769 --> 01:21:09.944
No. Please! I'm alone.
Please just get me out of here!

01:21:09.946 --> 01:21:12.729
Hey, listen,
you've got to stay quiet.

01:21:12.731 --> 01:21:14.905
Please! They have my son!
They have my boy.

01:21:14.907 --> 01:21:18.605
Look, we're gonna help you,
but you have got to stay quiet.

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:20.999
- Where's your son?
- I think he's in the house.

01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:24.698
- Please help us. They've got him.
- Get her out of here.

01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:26.874
Where are you going?
You're going to...

01:21:26.876 --> 01:21:28.573
Just get her out of here!

01:23:52.064 --> 01:23:54.415
- Hang on.
- Please hurry!

01:23:55.416 --> 01:23:57.026
I'm gonna get you
out of there.

01:24:20.267 --> 01:24:21.746
Shit!

01:24:44.116 --> 01:24:46.597
Please hurry up!
Please!

01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:51.950
Thank God! Thank God!

01:26:15.773 --> 01:26:17.991
I'll kill him!

01:26:17.993 --> 01:26:21.039
I'll fucking rip
his face off!

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.302
I'll kill him!

01:26:24.304 --> 01:26:26.739
I'll do it!

01:26:26.741 --> 01:26:28.917
I'll do it!

01:26:30.353 --> 01:26:32.834
I'll do it!

01:26:35.445 --> 01:26:39.449
I'm going to kill him!

01:26:43.192 --> 01:26:47.194
I'll rip his little
fucking face off!

01:26:47.196 --> 01:26:49.416
I'll do it!

01:27:00.557 --> 01:27:03.691
Put the gun down!

01:27:09.479 --> 01:27:10.959
Do it!

01:27:19.924 --> 01:27:22.925
Don't you dare hurt him.

01:27:22.927 --> 01:27:24.364
Put it down!

01:27:29.499 --> 01:27:31.196
Kick it over here.

01:28:31.387 --> 01:28:32.910
Thanks.

01:28:42.616 --> 01:28:45.965
Danny! Oh, my God, Danny!
Thank God!

01:28:47.664 --> 01:28:49.969
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

01:28:49.971 --> 01:28:52.058
Are you okay?
Did they hurt you, baby?

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:53.975
Oh, God!

01:29:06.857 --> 01:29:08.468
Oh, God!

01:29:26.007 --> 01:29:28.181
Oh, God. That's him!

01:29:28.183 --> 01:29:30.664
It's him. Oh, God!

01:29:36.452 --> 01:29:38.496
Kyle,
get her out of here.

01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:40.062
Let's go. Let's go.

01:29:40.064 --> 01:29:41.805
Come on, Danny.

01:29:45.548 --> 01:29:48.201
- Thank you.
- Go!

01:29:48.203 --> 01:29:49.594
But...

01:29:49.596 --> 01:29:51.162
Get out of here!

01:29:52.337 --> 01:29:54.557
- Thank you.
- Let's go, let's go.

01:31:06.150 --> 01:31:08.324
Listen, go to the end
of the orchard.

01:31:08.326 --> 01:31:09.674
You'll see a van
at the top of the hill.

01:31:09.676 --> 01:31:11.719
- No, you can't...
- Get out of here. Go! Go!

01:31:11.721 --> 01:31:13.593
You got to go back! Go!

01:34:22.172 --> 01:34:23.695
Fuck!

01:39:19.339 --> 01:39:21.123
Let him go!

01:39:22.603 --> 01:39:25.299
Let him go,
you motherfucker!

01:39:29.958 --> 01:39:33.829
Let him go!

01:39:33.831 --> 01:39:35.964
I'll fucking light 'em!

01:39:59.161 --> 01:40:02.119
Fuck you!

01:41:31.471 --> 01:41:33.299
Let him go!

01:41:34.343 --> 01:41:36.084
Let him go!

01:41:38.042 --> 01:41:39.435
Kyle!

01:41:42.482 --> 01:41:44.614
Let him...
Let him go.

01:41:46.834 --> 01:41:48.444
Let him go!

01:41:50.446 --> 01:41:52.666
Let him go,
or I'll fucking roast them.

01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:59.714
Don't!

01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:04.066
- Let him go!
- N-No!

01:42:04.068 --> 01:42:06.070
Stop!

01:42:07.071 --> 01:42:08.810
Stop!

01:42:08.812 --> 01:42:10.725
Just do it, Tina!

01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:14.688
Stop!

01:42:17.952 --> 01:42:20.735
No!

01:42:20.737 --> 01:42:23.260
Stop!

01:42:23.262 --> 01:42:25.307
Stop!

01:42:39.016 --> 01:42:41.584
Kyle? Kyle!

01:42:42.542 --> 01:42:44.370
Kyle, get up!

01:43:01.691 --> 01:43:04.477
God, Kyle!

01:43:26.325 --> 01:43:27.848
Hey!

01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:30.057
Tina,
go get the car.

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:35.408
Tina, go.

01:45:35.410 --> 01:45:37.323
We need to get him
to a hospital.

01:45:41.285 --> 01:45:42.591
Go!

01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:49.598
They ask questions
at hospitals.

01:45:50.991 --> 01:45:53.818
We'll tell them
it was a dog.

01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:56.953
A real, mean fucking Chihuahua.
