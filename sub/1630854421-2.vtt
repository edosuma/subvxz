[bleak music]

00:09.884 --> 00:17.058
* *

00:27.819 --> 00:31.698
- It could be Vincent
put it there himself,

00:31.740 --> 00:34.659
like he left his phone behind,
not wanting to be found.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.538
- Oh, you don't believe that.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.416
- Why don't you just say it?
You think he's dead.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.377
- Mr. Conte, do you think
your son is dead?

00:44.419 --> 00:46.963
Parents often have instincts

00:47.005 --> 00:49.090
when it comes
to their children.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.885
Do you think your son is dead?
- How dare you ask me that.

00:51.926 --> 00:55.388
- I'm sorry. I asked, because
sometimes people know things

00:55.430 --> 00:57.682
without knowing them.

00:57.724 --> 01:01.102
- What I know is what
I already told you,

01:01.144 --> 01:02.896
that Vincent doesn't have
the tenacity

01:02.937 --> 01:05.106
to run away nor to stay away.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.901
He's too weak.
You need to find him.

01:07.942 --> 01:14.824

[dramatic music]

01:20.330 --> 01:27.462
* *

02:27.939 --> 02:29.441
- I'm so sorry.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.068
My family in times of crisis,

02:32.110 --> 02:33.820
we come bearing baked goods.

02:33.862 --> 02:37.282
That and if there's anything
I could possibly do,

02:37.323 --> 02:40.702
which I say even when I know
there isn't.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.247
- Thank you.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.665
Come in.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.173
- I heard about the backpack.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.050
Has here been anything else?

02:55.091 --> 02:56.968
- No, nothing.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.180
- And how's Olivia?

03:00.221 --> 03:02.599
Is she doing okay?

03:02.640 --> 03:06.728
- She's--she's pretty stoic,
at least outwardly.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.189
Inside, I don't know.
None of us are doing too well.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.524
- I can imagine.

03:13.276 --> 03:16.237
Well, if there is anything
I can do,

03:16.279 --> 03:18.531
you will let me know.

03:18.573 --> 03:21.993
- Actually, here, sit.

03:22.577 --> 03:26.956
Has--has Vincent ever
said anything

03:26.998 --> 03:28.625
to you or Zach,

03:28.667 --> 03:33.546
I mean, even indirectly
about running away or...

03:34.339 --> 03:35.924
- No.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.468
But...

03:39.594 --> 03:42.389
I might have said
something to him.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.724
- What do you mean?

03:44.766 --> 03:48.228
- Well, he seemed a little more
troubled of late,

03:48.269 --> 03:52.148
and my sense was--
like, forgive me,

03:52.190 --> 03:55.402
my sense was that of, you know,
it was something about here.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.029
- Here? What--

03:58.071 --> 03:59.447
- Well, his home life.

03:59.489 --> 04:04.994
I told him
you don't have to stay, that--

04:05.036 --> 04:06.996
you know, I asked
if there were other places

04:07.038 --> 04:09.749
he could go,
like relatives or--

04:09.791 --> 04:11.418
- Wait. You said that to him?

04:11.459 --> 04:14.337
- Well, he shut
the idea down completely.

04:15.213 --> 04:20.427
But now as I play it back,

04:20.468 --> 04:22.595
maybe my questions
struck a chord.

04:25.056 --> 04:28.685
- Did--did you tell this
to the police, Dania?

04:28.727 --> 04:29.978
- No.

04:31.396 --> 04:35.025
Honestly, I didn't think
anything of it.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.611
It was such a fleeting question
that didn't even seem to land.

04:38.653 --> 04:43.033
But now I'm suddenly wondering,

04:43.074 --> 04:44.826
maybe it did.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.164
Perhaps I planted the seed.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.416
I am so sorry, Nora.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.918
It was not my business.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.381
But I saw him hurting,

04:58.423 --> 05:02.927
and I--I felt--
- Oh, my God.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.767
- He'll come back.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.018
He has to.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.235
- This feels
like a harsh place.

05:19.277 --> 05:21.154
- Yeah, it's high school.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.489
That's kind of the point.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.824
It's meant to be Darwinian.

05:24.866 --> 05:28.495
Maybe not the safest place
for Vincent.

05:28.536 --> 05:31.748
- Was it for you? Harsh?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.541
- It's partly why I'm a cop.

05:34.876 --> 05:39.005
I had a pretty rough go of it
my sophomore year.

05:39.047 --> 05:41.966
I would rush home from school,
hole up,

05:42.008 --> 05:44.761
and just watch TV.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.097
- Let me guess,
"Law & Order."

05:47.138 --> 05:49.349
- Yeah, I found it comforting.

05:49.391 --> 05:51.351
- Mr. Avraham?

05:51.393 --> 05:52.894
I beg your pardon.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.188
Is it your first name Avraham
or your last?

05:55.230 --> 05:56.564
- Both.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.024
- Avraham Avraham?

05:58.066 --> 06:00.652
- My parents liked the name.
This is Detective Harris.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.238
- My pleasure. We will summon
Master Lafferty,

06:03.279 --> 06:04.531
but best I alert his parent.

06:04.572 --> 06:05.990
- For what reason?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.617
- Well, when the police show up
to talk to students--

06:07.659 --> 06:09.577
- He's not a suspect.
We just wanna get information.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.246
- Even so,
if it were my child--

06:11.287 --> 06:13.331
- Let's pretend that.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.209
That Vincent Conte
is your child.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.585
He is missing.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.884
[tense music]

06:24.926 --> 06:30.473
* *

06:30.515 --> 06:31.766
- How you doing, John?

06:31.808 --> 06:33.393
- This is harassment.

06:33.435 --> 06:34.853
- Just keeping an eye
on your stuff.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.187
- You've been dispatched
by your colleague.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.773
- Yeah, well, we're looking
for a missing kid.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.192
- I already told Mr. Avraham
that I haven't seen him.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.863
- Well, yeah, I'm here to learn
what you did see,

06:44.904 --> 06:47.449
because you notice shit, John.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.534
Hey.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.952
Have a seat.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.630
- It's a bigotry.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.425
Like it's a crime
to be homeless.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.760
I'm always a suspect.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.136
- No one's accusing you
of anything.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.387
- Nonsense.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.056
Every time
there's a broken window,

07:11.097 --> 07:14.476
a jimmied car door,
an overturned trash can

07:14.517 --> 07:19.606
eyes turn to me,
be it neighbors or officers.

07:19.647 --> 07:22.442
There's a contagion to it,

07:22.484 --> 07:26.279
which I'm not immune to,
you know?

07:26.321 --> 07:27.906
The suspicion,

07:27.947 --> 07:30.867
it breeds self-doubt, thoughts
which I have to live with.

07:30.909 --> 07:34.579
I, you know, I cannot just--
I cannot just brush them away.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.955
You know,
it needs to stop.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.832
- Okay. Okay, hey,
but you'd agree--

07:37.874 --> 07:39.793
you'd agree
that if a kid goes missing,

07:39.834 --> 07:42.295
it makes sense
that we ask around.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.214
- Yeah, but you haven't really
asked around, have you?

07:44.255 --> 07:45.632
- Yeah, well,
we're just getting started.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.342
- Yeah, with me.
And I don't like it.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.635
- Look, look, nobody's accusing
you of anything.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.553
We just want your help, okay?

07:50.595 --> 07:52.138
Okay?

07:52.180 --> 07:54.224
You were at the kid's apartment
the day he went missing.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.935
People saw you.
- People--fucking people--

07:56.976 --> 08:00.313
People are wrong.
Look, I wasn't there.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.148
It's you people.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.526
You put bad thoughts
into my head,

08:04.567 --> 08:05.985
and it needs to stop
'cause you need--

08:06.027 --> 08:07.529
- Okay, sorry.
- It needs to stop.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.824
- Okay, sorry.
I'm sor--John.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.372
- Benjamin?
- Am I in trouble?

08:17.414 --> 08:20.667
- Have you done anything
to cause trouble, Benjamin?

08:20.709 --> 08:22.043
- No.

08:22.085 --> 08:25.547
- Vincent Conte is your friend?

08:25.588 --> 08:27.048
- Yes.

08:27.090 --> 08:30.176
- You're Vincent's best friend,
according to his mother.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.720
- Yes.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.514
- And you would do what you can
to help your best friend.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.686
- Do you know where he is?

08:39.728 --> 08:41.146
- No.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.815
- But you know
that he's missing?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.400
- His mother told me.

08:48.111 --> 08:52.741
- She asked you if Vincent
was at school on Tuesday,

08:52.782 --> 08:54.325
and you told her he was.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.494
That was a lie, Benjamin.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.580
The school attendance records
indicate

08:58.621 --> 09:01.458
that Vincent never arrived
at school on Tuesday.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.336
- Why did you tell his mother
that he did?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.379
- I just thought that he cut,

09:06.421 --> 09:08.757
and I didn't want
to rat him out.

09:08.798 --> 09:12.635
- Benjamin,
this is very serious.

09:12.677 --> 09:16.723
There's a police investigation
into Vincent's disappearance,

09:16.765 --> 09:19.476
and you've complicated
that investigation.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.603
You've obstructed it.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.731
We need you to be truthful
with us going forward, okay?

09:26.524 --> 09:28.610
- Where is Vincent?

09:28.651 --> 09:31.821
- I don't know, I promise.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.031
- Did he run away?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.532
- I don't think.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.034
- Has he ever mentioned
running away?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.410
- In the past, maybe,

09:37.452 --> 09:39.746
but lately
he was in a pretty good place.

09:39.788 --> 09:40.872
- How so?

09:40.914 --> 09:43.249
- Well, for starters,
he has a date--

09:43.291 --> 09:46.378
or had one tonight,

09:46.419 --> 09:49.255
He's never had a date before.
Ever.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.383
He was looking forward to it,
so...

09:51.424 --> 09:53.301
- Who was the date with?

09:53.343 --> 09:55.595
- Hailey Townsend.
[coughs]

10:01.893 --> 10:05.730
- You just vomited
in your mouth, Benjamin.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.942
And I can see that
you've swallowed your vomit.

10:10.819 --> 10:13.029
Are you nervous?

10:13.071 --> 10:16.241
Or is this something you do?

10:16.282 --> 10:19.661
- I don't handle stress well.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.747
- Tell us
about this Hailey Townsend.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.750
- She's probably
the hottest girl in our class.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.211
Maybe
in the whole school even.

10:28.253 --> 10:32.090
Vincent would not pick
this week

10:32.132 --> 10:34.718
to run away.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.511
- You're not in trouble,
Hailey.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.681
- So you and Vincent
had a date planned?

10:39.723 --> 10:42.142
- We were gonna go to a movie.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.602
- If you had nothing else
going on,

10:44.644 --> 10:48.273
if you wanted to go out
with me or whatever.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.483
- Are you two
romantically involved?

10:51.651 --> 10:53.445
Friends?

10:53.486 --> 10:56.614
- Yes.
We're in French together.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.533
We talk.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.077
He's a nice person.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.287
Very sweet.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.997
- You seem very contrite.

11:04.039 --> 11:05.331
- I'm so sorry.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.625
- Tell us
what you're sorry about.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.421
- Vincent's nice, so nice.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.673
But I don't like him like that.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.509
He asked me to go
to the movies, and I said yes.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.930
A little bit
'cause I felt sorry for him.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.101
But also...
- Also what?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.314
- To make my boyfriend jealous.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.732
- Did it work?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.944
- Um...a little.

11:34.986 --> 11:38.114
- What's his name,
your boyfriend?

11:38.156 --> 11:40.075
- Billy.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.576
Billy Livingston.

11:41.618 --> 11:44.662
- So he knew about your
impending date with Vincent.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.873
- I posted it on Instagram.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.337
There were some...

11:52.379 --> 11:55.173
some pretty mean comments.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.592
- Ooh.
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.511
Did she write all this?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.638
- Other people.
- Man.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.516
- Adults got nothing on kids
when it comes to cruelty.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.685
- I mean, this would explain
him running away.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.687
- Or jumping off the bridge.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.146
You talk to the boyfriend?

12:10.188 --> 12:11.398
- He's on the list.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.024
- How'd it go
with Mr. Wentworth?

12:13.066 --> 12:15.860
- He says he didn't see
anything suspicious,

12:15.902 --> 12:17.570
complained
that we find him suspicious,

12:17.612 --> 12:19.072
says it's bigotry,

12:19.114 --> 12:21.282
and he can't sweep
the negative thoughts

12:21.324 --> 12:23.451
out of his--
out of his head.

12:23.493 --> 12:24.744
- I want you to take
the boyfriend.

12:24.786 --> 12:25.870
- Great.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.872
- How are we doing
on Vincent's phone?

12:27.914 --> 12:29.666
- Yeah, I'm meeting
with the tech this afternoon.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.292
Should've made progress by now.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.253
- Let's hope. Hope is good.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.423
[speaking in Hebrew]

12:41.386 --> 12:42.887
- Do you know
what he just said?

12:42.929 --> 12:45.515
- Uh, yeah,
free agency ruined baseball.

12:45.557 --> 12:49.978
- "And with that,
I just laid my head down.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.646
"I did not cry.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.649
"There was no need.

12:54.691 --> 12:58.570
I just laid my head down."

13:00.739 --> 13:05.076
- That was very powerful,
Rebecca.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.870
I love the way your broke
that last sentence down

13:06.911 --> 13:11.249
into three.
- Thank you.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.209
- Who's next? Anyone?

13:18.548 --> 13:19.924
Zach?

13:26.181 --> 13:28.141
- Sure.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.185
[clears throat]

13:30.226 --> 13:32.479
It's called "The Letter."

13:32.520 --> 13:35.899
It's from a son to his parents.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.942
- You shouldn't have to tell us
what it's about, Zach.

13:37.984 --> 13:41.446
Just let the piece
declare itself if it can.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.948
- Okay.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.080
"Father and Mother,

13:50.121 --> 13:53.166
"I know you've been looking
for me.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.794
"I suggest you stop.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.630
"You won't find me.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.174
"You said I disappeared
on Tuesday.

14:01.216 --> 14:04.928
"But we know that I went
missing long before then.

14:04.969 --> 14:08.348
"I didn't vanish
in a single day.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.433
"It was a gradual process,

14:10.475 --> 14:12.727
"one in which you participated.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.106
"You eroded me

14:16.147 --> 14:19.693
"bit by bit by bit

14:19.734 --> 14:22.654
"until you made me gone.

14:24.197 --> 14:28.451
"I ask, why are you looking
for me now?

14:28.493 --> 14:32.122
"Perhaps you're afraid.
I wonder.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.582
"You must be asking yourselves
where I am now,

14:34.624 --> 14:38.586
"where I am writing from.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.005
"And I can only say

14:40.046 --> 14:43.842
"that I am writing
from somewhere far away.

14:43.883 --> 14:49.347
"Listening. Watching.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.808
"No longer yours.

14:51.850 --> 14:55.520
[tense music]

14:55.562 --> 14:57.605
Son."

14:57.647 --> 15:01.568
* *

15:01.609 --> 15:04.112
- That was excellent.

15:04.154 --> 15:05.113
- It was?

15:05.155 --> 15:08.867
- Yes, it had intrigue,
suspense.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.785
I wanna know more.
Is there more?

15:10.827 --> 15:14.039
- I was planning
to continue with it.

15:15.457 --> 15:17.208
- I really think you should.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.212
* *

15:31.598 --> 15:33.308
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.809
So I gotta ask you
a question,

15:34.851 --> 15:36.478
and I'd appreciate
an honest answer.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.397
This detective,
are you attracted to him?

15:39.439 --> 15:42.067
- What?
- I can sense it.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.486
- What would make you ask
such an obscene thing?

15:44.527 --> 15:45.945
- Because I can sense it.

15:45.987 --> 15:48.323
- Our son is gone, and this
is what you're feeling?

15:48.365 --> 15:49.949
Jealousy?

15:49.991 --> 15:51.576
- People don't choose
their feelings, Nora.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.079
They tend to come and go
on their own accord.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.664
You're drawn to him.
Don't tell me you aren't.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.792
And you think he's gentle
and kind and whatever else.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.628
But let me tell you something
before you get too smitten.

16:01.670 --> 16:04.047
This detective thinks
we're guilty people.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.840
Whatever he thinks happened
to Vincent,

16:05.882 --> 16:08.301
he thinks you and I
are responsible,

16:08.343 --> 16:09.886
especially me.
- Why do you say that?

16:09.928 --> 16:11.429
- Because of the questions
he asks me.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.764
Because of the way
he looks at me.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.224
He's not out there
looking for Vincent.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.685
He's here talking to us,
calling us down to the station.

16:16.726 --> 16:17.936
- They found his backpack.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.562
- I'm just saying,
he comes here,

16:19.604 --> 16:21.606
and he sits on Vincent's bed
staring at the wall

16:21.648 --> 16:24.401
waiting for some kind of
fuckin' spiritual intervention.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.444
What the hell is that?

16:26.486 --> 16:29.114
- You used to be kind
and gentle.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.907
- Oh, see, that kind
of disgust right there,

16:30.949 --> 16:33.952
he picks up on that,
doesn't he, this detective?

16:33.993 --> 16:36.037
- You know,
I not only long for Vincent.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.789
I long for you, too.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.291
I sometimes pray
for the man I married

16:40.333 --> 16:42.335
to return, the man I fell
in love with

16:42.377 --> 16:44.963
to somehow,
miraculously reappear.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.173
- Okay.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.300
- You know what? You're right
about one thing, though.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.677
You do disgust me,

16:50.719 --> 16:55.432
how you constantly
undermine Vincent and me.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.475
God, I lie so much. I'm done.

16:57.517 --> 17:01.312
I'm done lying to you,
to the detective, to me.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.899
Just stop it. Stop.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.987
[door slams]

17:09.029 --> 17:12.073
[tango music playing]

17:12.115 --> 17:14.576
- Okay, everybody,
I want to see you dance.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.662
Okay, show me your steps.

17:17.704 --> 17:21.166
[speaking Spanish]
Yes, good.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.917
Those are strong.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.087
* *

17:26.129 --> 17:28.673
Good. Feel the moment, yes.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.508
Feel that moment.
Let it last.

17:30.550 --> 17:36.348
* *

17:36.389 --> 17:38.975
Can you move your arm
a little more around her body?

17:39.017 --> 17:40.852
- Okay.
- Yes, and you work,

17:40.894 --> 17:42.062
embrace her.
- [laughs]

17:42.103 --> 17:43.605
- Very good, everybody.

17:43.646 --> 17:47.025
I love it. Very good.
Very good.

17:47.067 --> 17:50.403
Yeah, I'm glad your smiling.
Yes, yes.

17:50.445 --> 17:52.322
You're doing much better, yes?

17:52.364 --> 17:59.496
* *

18:01.581 --> 18:04.709
[both giggling]

18:15.303 --> 18:16.721
- How'd it go?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.556
- He was
the most perfect little angel.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.266
Almost makes me want
to have a baby.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.726
- Oh, God.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.478
- He went down
about 8:00 without a fuss.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.064
- Oh.
- How was it, the dancing?

18:26.106 --> 18:30.694
- Let's just say
it was much needed. Cash?

18:30.735 --> 18:32.570
- Venmo is good.
- Thanks, Angie.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.406
- Okay, well,
I'll call you about Saturday.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.449
- Okay. 'Night.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.204
- [sighs]

18:41.246 --> 18:43.081
I really enjoyed that.

18:43.123 --> 18:44.207
- Me, too.

18:46.209 --> 18:49.546
- * Our love is a lie *

18:49.587 --> 18:53.425
* And so it begins *

18:53.466 --> 18:56.761
* Foolishly laying our hearts
on the table *

18:56.803 --> 18:58.972
* Stumblin' in *

18:59.014 --> 19:01.558
- Hey, Billy.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.268
Hope you're not playing
for money.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.437
And on a school night.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.771
- Who are you?

19:06.813 --> 19:09.065
- I always go to the "what"
before the "who."

19:09.107 --> 19:11.818
This is a badge. That's a beer.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.112
- You're gonna hassle me
over a beer?

19:14.154 --> 19:16.448
- No, dipshit.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.950
I'm gonna hassle you
'cause Vincent Conte's missing.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.326
- * Whatever you do *

19:20.368 --> 19:23.038
- Let's talk.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.915
- Look, I'm telling you
I didn't even know the kid.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.584
- Well, you knew him
well enough to threaten

19:27.625 --> 19:29.961
to kick his ass
for talking to your girl.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.463
- Yeah, well,
I was messing with him,

19:31.504 --> 19:32.964
and I didn't do it.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.383
- You know he had a date
scheduled with her, right?

19:35.425 --> 19:38.678
- Yeah, well, a lot of guys
are after my girlfriend.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.055
I mean,
a few I gotta worry about.

19:40.096 --> 19:43.058
Vincent Conte
doesn't make the list.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.643
- Well, Hailey evidently saw
something in him.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.979
- Okay. Talk to her.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.481
- We have.

19:49.522 --> 19:50.648
- What'd she say?

19:50.690 --> 19:53.818
[bluesy rock music]

19:53.860 --> 19:57.113
- Let's focus on you.
Yeah?

20:02.494 --> 20:04.371
- [muttering]

20:04.412 --> 20:06.706
Boom. Found you.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.792
[bell jingles]

20:08.833 --> 20:11.169
Earl told me
you like to eat here.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.296
- Did he tell you
I like to eat alone?

20:13.338 --> 20:14.673
- Don't be like that.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.883
Being a loner isn't good
for you in the long run.

20:16.925 --> 20:18.551
- In the short run, it can be.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.053
Solitude helps me think.

20:20.095 --> 20:21.513
- I guess this answers
my question

20:21.554 --> 20:23.348
about you keeping kosher.

20:23.390 --> 20:26.685
- "NYPD officers should avoid
discussing the religious

20:26.726 --> 20:28.603
or cultural practices
of their colleagues,"

20:28.645 --> 20:29.938
quote, unquote.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.648
If you're gonna pass
the lieutenants exam,

20:31.690 --> 20:32.857
you should know this.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.150
- How do you know
I'm studying for it?

20:34.192 --> 20:36.152
- Lieutenant is the next rung
on the ladder.

20:36.194 --> 20:38.697
You're ambitious,
also impatient.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.907
You just made detective.

20:40.949 --> 20:44.369
- Tech found some nuggets
on his phone.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.538
Vincent's.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.707
First, Hailey Townsend.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.375
It wasn't just
French study pals

20:50.417 --> 20:51.876
going to a movie.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.587
She was sexting him.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.214
- She sent him these?
- Mm-hmm.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.383
They were deleted, but we were
able to retrieve them

20:58.425 --> 20:59.592
from his cloud.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.886
- Did he reciprocate?

21:01.928 --> 21:03.263
- Not as far as I can tell.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.389
A lot of correspondence

21:04.431 --> 21:06.349
between him and his tutor,
Zack Miller.

21:06.391 --> 21:09.102
Seems like their relationship
is a little more than academic.

21:09.144 --> 21:11.021
Here's one
that we can't source.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.064
"I'm always here to talk."

21:13.106 --> 21:15.900
The number traces back
to a prepaid burner phone.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.277
No registered account holder.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.904
Here's another
from the same number.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.907
It says,
"That shouldn't have happened."

21:22.949 --> 21:25.535
- When did he receive that?
- On Sunday.

21:25.577 --> 21:27.328
- So something happened
on Sunday.

21:27.370 --> 21:31.791
- We tried calling, but it
appears to be disconnected.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.126
- These are more
than nuggets, Janine.

21:33.168 --> 21:35.003
- Oh, here's the most dramatic.

21:35.045 --> 21:38.131
"You need to die already."

21:38.173 --> 21:41.009
Let's hope
that's not too on point.

21:41.051 --> 21:44.179
- Do we know who sent him that?

21:44.220 --> 21:45.722
- We do.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.020
[knocking]

21:52.062 --> 21:54.147
- I need to speak
to your daughter.

21:54.189 --> 21:56.358
- Why?

21:56.399 --> 21:58.610
- It would be helpful
to the investigation.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.278
- She doesn't know anything.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.364
Oh, right, sometimes people
can know things

22:02.405 --> 22:04.449
without knowing.

22:05.325 --> 22:08.078
- I would think we're all
on the same side, Mr. Conte,

22:08.119 --> 22:09.954
that we all want
to find Vincent.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.873
Do I have it wrong?

22:15.377 --> 22:18.505
- Well,
I would need to be present.

22:18.546 --> 22:20.674
- "You need to die already."

22:20.715 --> 22:22.676
That's a pretty
aggressive text,

22:22.717 --> 22:24.678
don't you think?

22:24.719 --> 22:28.139
- Why would you send him--
- Mrs. Conte.

22:28.181 --> 22:31.476
Do you wish your brother harm?

22:31.518 --> 22:33.812
- I text him stuff like that
all the time.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.188
- We searched his phone.

22:35.230 --> 22:38.108
We found no such other texts
from you like this.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.402
We found this one on Monday.

22:40.443 --> 22:43.113
What happened on Monday?

22:43.154 --> 22:44.489
- We argued.

22:44.531 --> 22:47.617
- What about?

22:47.659 --> 22:50.120
- I--I honestly don't remember.

22:50.161 --> 22:52.497
- For you to text him
that he should die,

22:52.539 --> 22:54.082
I would think you would recall.

22:54.124 --> 22:58.336
- Well, my brother isn't really
that popular at school,

22:58.378 --> 23:02.507
and he doesn't make it
any easier for me to be liked.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.175
We fight about that.

23:04.217 --> 23:06.302
- You fight to persuade him
to be more popular.

23:06.344 --> 23:09.389
- No, I wanted him
to be less embarrassing,

23:09.431 --> 23:11.933
to me, if not to himself.

23:13.685 --> 23:16.062
Specifically on Monday,
I told him my life would be

23:16.104 --> 23:19.858
a lot easier if he would
just crawl under a rock.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.027
And then he said
something back.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.529
Don't remember exactly what.
Probably meaner.

23:24.571 --> 23:27.365
And then I said something back.
Don't remember exactly what.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.701
Probably meaner.

23:29.743 --> 23:31.036
Sibling love.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.246
- Do you not love Vincent?

23:34.581 --> 23:36.791
- Of course I do.
He's my brother.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.918
[ominous music]

23:38.960 --> 23:41.755
He--he wouldn't run away
because of something

23:41.796 --> 23:43.381
that I said or did.

23:43.423 --> 23:46.551
- Why would he run away?
Do you have any idea?

23:46.593 --> 23:50.764
* *

23:50.805 --> 23:52.974
- No.

23:53.016 --> 23:54.893
- The argument that Vincent
and your father had

23:54.934 --> 23:56.853
Monday night, did you hear
what it was about?

23:56.895 --> 23:58.104
- I told you
it was about college.

23:58.146 --> 24:01.733
- Did you overhear
the argument, Olivia?

24:01.775 --> 24:04.027
- No.

24:04.069 --> 24:06.196
When they get into it,
I just put my headphones in.

24:06.237 --> 24:08.198
- Do they get into it a lot?

24:08.239 --> 24:10.658
- Okay.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.869
I think that's enough.

24:12.911 --> 24:15.246
- I'll walk you out.

24:19.250 --> 24:22.212
[train rumbling]

24:30.887 --> 24:32.222
- You gonna let me in?

24:32.263 --> 24:34.599
- No,
this is a gated community.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.227
Closes at 9:00.

24:37.268 --> 24:40.980
So now we can say
it rises to harassment.

24:41.022 --> 24:43.942
- "Hokusai Says."
You know this poem?

24:45.819 --> 24:47.654
- Roger Keyes.
- Yeah, Keyes.

24:47.696 --> 24:50.949
You taught Keyes
at Rockefeller.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.076
- Well, I've already been
canceled for what I taught,

24:53.118 --> 24:55.328
if you're looking to pile on.

24:56.287 --> 24:59.582
- "His strength is life
living through you.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.543
"He said don't be afraid.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.086
Don't be afraid."

25:03.128 --> 25:05.255
- We found that
on Vincent Conte's phone.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.841
- "Let life take you
by the hand.

25:07.882 --> 25:09.509
And let life live
through you."

25:09.551 --> 25:12.053
- Bit of a coincidence,
don't you think,

25:12.095 --> 25:13.430
that the missing boy
quotes a poet

25:13.471 --> 25:15.265
that you used to teach?

25:15.306 --> 25:17.642
- Well, it's a well-known poem
by a well-known poet.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.227
- Mm-mm, even so.

25:19.269 --> 25:21.104
[horn honks]

25:21.146 --> 25:22.814
- You know what would be
on my syllabus

25:22.856 --> 25:24.232
if I was still teaching today?

25:24.274 --> 25:25.608
- Who?

25:25.650 --> 25:28.236
- Harry G. Frankfurt.

25:28.278 --> 25:30.321
Yeah, he wrote an essay
"On Bullshit."

25:30.363 --> 25:31.656
[train rumbling]

25:31.698 --> 25:35.118
- On what?
- "On Bullshit"!

25:39.330 --> 25:40.415
How it's a--

25:40.457 --> 25:43.126
how it's a particular form
of falsity,

25:43.168 --> 25:47.839
which is exponentially
more dangerous than lies.

25:47.881 --> 25:50.342
Now...

25:50.383 --> 25:53.553
you might like Frankfurt,
Detective.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.013
- 'Cause I'm full of shit?

26:00.143 --> 26:01.936
- I have never met
your missing boy.

26:01.978 --> 26:04.814
- Hey, listen to me.

26:04.856 --> 26:07.192
You told Avi
the kid seemed sad.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.444
Now, did you pick up
on anything else?

26:09.486 --> 26:11.404
[tense music]

26:11.446 --> 26:14.449
- Yeah.

26:14.491 --> 26:16.868
Yeah, he seemed sweet.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.955
But don't we all?

26:20.997 --> 26:28.129
* *

26:30.882 --> 26:33.843
[train rumbling]

26:33.885 --> 26:35.679
- Okay, so here's what I got.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.347
She says it was just harmless

26:37.389 --> 26:40.141
and that this is what
high school girls do sometimes.

26:40.183 --> 26:43.186
- They sext unsuspecting boys?

26:43.228 --> 26:46.022
- Yeah, it's kind of like
sharing pictures

26:46.064 --> 26:47.899
from "National Geographic."

26:47.941 --> 26:50.110
"Here's a pretty place
you'll never get to see."

26:50.151 --> 26:52.612
The plot does thicken, though,

26:52.654 --> 26:55.115
because Benjamin thinks
that they kissed.

26:55.156 --> 26:56.616
- Vincent and Hailey?

26:56.658 --> 26:58.576
- Yeah,
evidently they had a bet,

26:58.618 --> 27:00.245
Vincent and Benjamin.

27:00.286 --> 27:04.374
$50 to whoever gets
French-kissed first.

27:04.416 --> 27:07.043
On Monday,
Vincent sent Benjamin a text.

27:07.085 --> 27:08.628
"You owe me 50 bucks,"

27:08.670 --> 27:09.963
which we have a record of.

27:10.005 --> 27:11.464
And remember on Sunday,

27:11.506 --> 27:14.217
Vincent got
that mysterious text.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.844
"That never
should have happened."

27:15.885 --> 27:19.848
So maybe Hailey's the one
with the burner phone.

27:19.889 --> 27:25.937
* *

27:25.979 --> 27:28.314
Avi?

27:29.149 --> 27:32.402
- Of course.

27:32.444 --> 27:34.612
Of course.

27:34.654 --> 27:36.865
- Of course what?

27:36.906 --> 27:43.705
* *

27:48.084 --> 27:50.170
[knocking]

27:52.380 --> 27:54.758
- Would it be possible
to see Vincent's closet again?

27:54.799 --> 27:56.134
- Yes.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.562
- Did he have the large?

28:07.604 --> 28:09.189
- I'm sorry?

28:09.230 --> 28:11.066
- His luggage.
The large one is not here.

28:11.107 --> 28:12.859
Where's the large?

28:12.901 --> 28:15.195
- I don't know.
- He had it?

28:15.236 --> 28:19.282
- Yes.
Yes, he has the whole set.

28:19.324 --> 28:21.076
He didn't have it when he left.

28:21.117 --> 28:22.285
I would have seen it.

28:22.327 --> 28:25.038
He just left with his backpack.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.123
- But if he was planning
to run away,

28:27.165 --> 28:29.459
he may have packed it
and moved it out sooner.

28:29.501 --> 28:31.795
I need you to check again
for cherished possessions,

28:31.836 --> 28:35.799
any pictures, favorite books,
letters that are missing.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.176
- So you think he ran away?

28:42.013 --> 28:43.473
- Does the building
have a basement?

28:43.515 --> 28:45.100
Anywhere it could be
in storage maybe?

28:45.141 --> 28:46.851
- I don't think.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.353
- Do think, Nora.

28:48.395 --> 28:49.979
This is very important
right now.

28:50.021 --> 28:51.773
- No, no, no, no,
it just--it would be here

28:51.815 --> 28:55.235
in his closet
with all the other pieces.

28:55.276 --> 28:58.238
[breathing heavily]
Oh, God. Sorry.

28:58.279 --> 29:00.198
- Are you all right?

29:02.992 --> 29:05.120
- Just, I've had this feeling
from the beginning,

29:05.161 --> 29:07.372
that he's dead,
and I don't know how or why.

29:07.414 --> 29:10.625
I just--I just know it.

29:10.667 --> 29:14.671
[door slams]
- [clears throat]

29:14.713 --> 29:17.257
- I just feel it.

29:17.298 --> 29:20.218
And you know I feel it,
don't you?

29:20.260 --> 29:22.429
And you feel it too?

29:22.470 --> 29:25.890
- I feel
something awful has happened.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.143
But I don't feel
that he's dead.

29:28.184 --> 29:31.146
[ominous music]

29:31.187 --> 29:33.690
* *

29:33.732 --> 29:37.360
- [sobbing] My son.

29:37.402 --> 29:40.488
- Well, look who's back
and hugging my wife.

29:40.530 --> 29:42.323
You wanna tell me
what the fuck's going on?

29:48.580 --> 29:51.166
- He's filed
a formal complaint,

29:51.207 --> 29:55.545
and, Avi,
he is not wrong to do so.

29:55.587 --> 29:57.422
- It's not unusual
for an officer

29:57.464 --> 29:58.965
to extend comfort
to a family member

29:59.007 --> 30:00.216
of a crime victim.

30:00.258 --> 30:03.678
- Uh-huh, and before that,
you held her hand.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.056
You sat on a bed together
holding hands.

30:06.097 --> 30:07.349
- Mr. Conte told you this?

30:07.390 --> 30:09.476
- No, evidently, she told him.

30:09.517 --> 30:12.979
You sat on the bed
to better feel Vincent,

30:13.021 --> 30:16.649
and you held her hand.

30:16.691 --> 30:17.692
Avi--

30:17.734 --> 30:19.444
- My feelings
sometimes serve me.

30:19.486 --> 30:21.780
- And sometimes
they clearly do not.

30:21.821 --> 30:23.865
You held her hand.

30:23.907 --> 30:27.410
You embraced her.

30:27.452 --> 30:29.079
Are you attracted
to this woman?

30:29.120 --> 30:31.748
- You know me better than that.
- No, I barely know you at all.

30:31.790 --> 30:34.793
Point me to anyone
out there who does.

30:34.834 --> 30:38.463
Leonard Conte is convinced that
his wife has feelings for you.

30:38.505 --> 30:41.800
He's been made uncomfortable
by the vibe he gets

30:41.841 --> 30:44.386
from the two of you
in the same room together.

30:44.427 --> 30:45.720
- This is an insult.

30:45.762 --> 30:48.348
- To me as your captain,
if there's even

30:48.390 --> 30:51.017
a shred of truth to it--
- There isn't.

30:51.059 --> 30:53.353
- [exhales]

30:55.480 --> 30:57.357
- Are you being
your best detective self

30:57.399 --> 30:58.983
on this case?

30:59.025 --> 31:01.778
Because from where I sit...

31:01.820 --> 31:03.988
[groans]

31:04.030 --> 31:05.782
- Finish it.

31:05.824 --> 31:09.077
- We've lost a full day
on this investigation,

31:09.119 --> 31:12.122
the most critical day,
because we got it wrong

31:12.163 --> 31:13.873
as to when Vincent disappeared.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.126
We thought it was Tuesday
after school,

31:16.167 --> 31:19.879
when in fact he never arrived
at school on Tuesday morning.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.464
We got it wrong

31:21.506 --> 31:23.633
because you took the mother
at her word

31:23.675 --> 31:25.510
without getting
any confirmation.

31:25.552 --> 31:28.013
Now, that is not like you, Avi,

31:28.054 --> 31:31.558
and it certainly isn't you
being your best detective self.

31:33.977 --> 31:36.312
So are we dealing
with a blind spot here?

31:36.354 --> 31:38.523
Are you dealing with one?
- I'm not.

31:39.941 --> 31:41.901
- I'm not sure
how to proceed here.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.653
- It's quite simple.

31:43.695 --> 31:45.739
I'm your
most skilled detective.

31:45.780 --> 31:47.240
If the goal is
to find Vincent--

31:47.282 --> 31:49.659
I'm guessing it still is--
I'm your best option.

31:49.701 --> 31:51.161
- Yeah, when you're doing
your best work,

31:51.202 --> 31:52.370
which right now you are not.

31:52.412 --> 31:53.955
How do I know this?

31:53.997 --> 31:56.249
Not because you're out there
hugging victims' mothers,

31:56.291 --> 31:59.210
but because we are three days
into this investigation,

31:59.252 --> 32:00.837
and we're fucking nowhere.

32:00.879 --> 32:03.381
There's a 16-year-old boy
out there missing.

32:03.423 --> 32:04.966
You don't have a clue.

32:05.008 --> 32:07.886
[tense music]

32:07.927 --> 32:09.387
* *

32:09.429 --> 32:11.639
- "You need to die already."

32:11.681 --> 32:13.892
That's a pretty
aggressive text,

32:13.933 --> 32:14.934
don't you think?

32:14.976 --> 32:17.103
Do you wish your brother harm?

32:17.145 --> 32:19.272
- I text him stuff like that
all the time.

32:19.314 --> 32:20.774
- We searched his phone.

32:20.815 --> 32:23.401
We found no such other texts
from you like this.

32:23.443 --> 32:25.278
We found this one on Monday.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.113
What happened on Monday?

32:27.155 --> 32:30.075
[all singing in Hebrew]

32:30.116 --> 32:37.082
* *

33:04.150 --> 33:07.112
[phone buzzing]

33:09.406 --> 33:12.367
[tense music]

33:12.409 --> 33:19.499
* *

33:39.561 --> 33:42.939
- I needed to apologize
for my husband.

33:44.649 --> 33:49.154
And to my husband,
which I've already done.

33:49.195 --> 33:50.947
- To your husband?

33:50.989 --> 33:55.285
- Because what he said,
it wasn't unfounded.

33:55.326 --> 33:57.829
For whatever reason,

33:57.871 --> 34:00.957
I am, uh, drawn to you.

34:02.334 --> 34:06.796
I think you represent
a certain compassion

34:06.838 --> 34:10.175
and sensitivity that's gone
missing from my life.

34:14.512 --> 34:17.515
And I am not saying this
to be untoward

34:17.557 --> 34:19.934
or to make any kind of advance,

34:19.976 --> 34:24.731
but just to mitigate
whatever animosity you may have

34:24.773 --> 34:26.316
towards my husband.

34:26.358 --> 34:29.694
He was off-base to accuse you,
but not to accuse me.

34:34.699 --> 34:36.493
Also,
he wants you off the case,

34:36.534 --> 34:39.829
and I am here to ask you--
to beg you

34:39.871 --> 34:42.123
to please stay on it.

34:43.500 --> 34:45.126
- Because?

34:45.168 --> 34:48.088
- Because
you're a good detective

34:48.129 --> 34:50.882
who feels my son.

34:50.924 --> 34:53.593
And if he's still alive,
if he can still be found,

34:53.635 --> 34:55.720
you're my best chance.

34:55.762 --> 35:02.811
* *

35:05.397 --> 35:07.023
Please.

35:12.737 --> 35:14.155
- That's pretty fucked up, Avi.

35:14.197 --> 35:15.699
Are you sure she wasn't trying
to make a pass at you?

35:15.740 --> 35:17.075
- She wasn't.

35:17.117 --> 35:20.537
- Okay, so where exactly are we
at this point?

35:20.578 --> 35:22.539
- I'm afraid
the captain may be right.

35:22.580 --> 35:24.040
We're much closer to nowhere

35:24.082 --> 35:25.917
than we are solved.
- We're not nowhere.

35:25.959 --> 35:28.294
After the shift, let's go out
and have a think and a drink.

35:28.336 --> 35:29.713
- Earl thinks better
out of the office.

35:29.754 --> 35:31.047
- Everyone does.

35:31.089 --> 35:32.632
The default network
in the brain works better

35:32.674 --> 35:34.050
when it's off the clock.

35:34.092 --> 35:35.635
Bob Dylan wrote
all his best songs

35:35.677 --> 35:37.721
after he retired
as a songwriter.

35:37.762 --> 35:38.888
- Is that true?
- Google it.

35:38.930 --> 35:40.640
First round's on me.

35:44.978 --> 35:46.563
- Okay, okay, okay,
so you say unhappy home.

35:46.604 --> 35:48.398
Fine. Maybe that's true.

35:48.440 --> 35:53.903
But maybe Vincent is the source
of that unhappiness.

35:53.945 --> 35:58.825
Teenage boys, they can be
these Olympian brooders.

35:58.867 --> 36:01.911
And where does teenage
unhappiness come from most,

36:01.953 --> 36:04.622
statistically speaking, right?

36:04.664 --> 36:06.416
From school.

36:06.458 --> 36:07.917
This kid, he was an outsider.

36:07.959 --> 36:10.503
He was bullied.
He was sexually taunted.

36:10.545 --> 36:12.380
And that girl's boyfriend, ugh.

36:12.422 --> 36:14.966
He struck me as bit
of a powder-kegger.

36:15.008 --> 36:17.385
And that's two in his life,
if you count his dad.

36:17.427 --> 36:20.180
So that's two powder-keggers
and counting.

36:20.221 --> 36:22.098
And let's not forget
about our friend Mr. Wentworth,

36:22.140 --> 36:23.433
who was in the area at the time

36:23.475 --> 36:26.227
with all his, you know,
mental health issues.

36:26.269 --> 36:29.689
So we've got
bits and pieces here.

36:29.731 --> 36:32.609
We got clues.
We're not nowhere.

36:32.650 --> 36:34.736
- I'm not a mother, okay,

36:34.778 --> 36:37.697
although I would like
to be one one day.

36:37.739 --> 36:39.032
- Aww.

36:39.074 --> 36:43.578
- Okay, I'm going
somewhere with this.

36:43.620 --> 36:46.373
Whenever that day comes,
I don't know,

36:46.414 --> 36:48.792
something tells me
I'll be discovering

36:48.833 --> 36:50.752
just the beginning
of the beginning

36:50.794 --> 36:53.963
of what it means
to truly and unconditionally

36:54.005 --> 36:56.675
love another person.

36:56.716 --> 36:59.969
And should something,
God forbid, happen to my child,

37:00.011 --> 37:02.180
like should he
or she go missing,

37:02.222 --> 37:05.850
I just--I don't think
I would have it within me

37:05.892 --> 37:10.522
to tumble to the feeling
that he's dead,

37:10.563 --> 37:12.982
like Nora's doing.

37:13.024 --> 37:14.651
No, I mean, you would think
the opposite, right?

37:14.693 --> 37:16.444
Denial would rear up

37:16.486 --> 37:21.324
and demand for any and every
other possibility.

37:21.366 --> 37:23.159
So she could fear
that he's dead, sure.

37:23.201 --> 37:25.829
But for her to feel it,
I think,

37:25.870 --> 37:27.997
she has to somehow know it.

37:28.039 --> 37:30.000
Even if it is knowing
without knowing,

37:30.041 --> 37:33.128
as you like to say.

37:33.169 --> 37:36.673
So yes,
I think we have made progress.

37:36.715 --> 37:38.842
We may not have found him,

37:38.883 --> 37:42.804
but he's most likely dead.

37:42.846 --> 37:45.974
And how do we know this?

37:46.016 --> 37:48.476
His mother's telling you, Avi.

37:52.439 --> 37:54.733
Any notes, feedback?

37:54.774 --> 37:58.028
I do do well
with positive reinforcement,

37:58.069 --> 37:59.988
FYI.

38:00.030 --> 38:02.365
- I'll think about it.

38:03.283 --> 38:09.039
- * The itsy bitsy spider
went up the water spout *

38:09.080 --> 38:13.793
* Down came the rain
and washed the spider out *

38:17.922 --> 38:21.009
* Up came the sun *

38:21.051 --> 38:23.636
* Dried up all the rain *

38:23.678 --> 38:28.391
* The itsy bitsy spider
went up the spout *

38:28.433 --> 38:30.518
[yawning] Again.

38:36.107 --> 38:39.069
* Went up the water spout *

38:41.112 --> 38:44.616
* And dried up all the rain *

38:44.657 --> 38:50.038
* The itsy bitsy spider *

38:50.080 --> 38:53.124
* Went up the spout again *

38:54.584 --> 38:58.922
* The itsy bitsy spider *

38:58.963 --> 39:01.925
* Down came the rain *

39:01.966 --> 39:07.013
* And washed the spider out *

39:08.807 --> 39:13.353
* Up came the sun and *

39:17.941 --> 39:20.151
"Mother and Father."

39:22.654 --> 39:26.950
"You want me to be unheard.

39:26.991 --> 39:29.661
"But I am heard.

39:29.703 --> 39:32.914
You wish me to be unfelt..."

39:32.956 --> 39:35.083
- "But I am felt.

39:35.125 --> 39:37.252
"You thought you made me gone.

39:37.293 --> 39:40.130
"But you failed.

39:40.171 --> 39:42.882
"I'm here,
and I will haunt you.

39:42.924 --> 39:45.427
I will not be gone."

39:45.468 --> 39:48.430
[eerie music]

39:48.471 --> 39:55.395
* *

40:23.548 --> 40:25.675
- What are you going?

40:25.717 --> 40:27.344
What are you doing?
- I--

40:27.385 --> 40:28.386
I was curious

40:28.428 --> 40:30.305
as to your writing project,
so...

40:30.347 --> 40:33.558
why is there
a letter from Vincent

40:33.600 --> 40:35.477
to his parents?

40:35.518 --> 40:39.105
What's going on?
- I--I wrote that.

40:39.147 --> 40:41.941
- No, these are handwritten
by him.

40:41.983 --> 40:44.944
I know Vincent's handwriting.

40:44.986 --> 40:48.573
"I will not be gone.
I will haunt you."

40:48.615 --> 40:50.533
- I--I can explain that.

40:50.575 --> 40:51.993
- Really?
- Yes.

40:52.035 --> 40:54.120
- Well, you better start.

40:56.456 --> 41:00.627
- The handwritten materials
were written by Vincent, yes.

41:00.669 --> 41:02.837
We were going over
his college essays,

41:02.879 --> 41:06.591
and I was encouraging him to,
you know, dig a little deeper,

41:06.633 --> 41:10.512
which you can obviously see
that he did.

41:10.553 --> 41:14.391
The stuff on the computer,
I wrote that.

41:14.432 --> 41:15.558
- Why?

41:15.600 --> 41:17.394
- For class.

41:17.435 --> 41:19.020
- For class?

41:19.062 --> 41:20.939
- Yes, Michael wanted me
to be more authentic.

41:20.980 --> 41:23.858
He told me that my writing
didn't feel real,

41:23.900 --> 41:27.445
so I just appropriated
some of Vincent's feelings,

41:27.487 --> 41:30.615
some of Vincent's thoughts,
and I used them in my--

41:30.657 --> 41:35.036
put them in my...you know?

41:35.078 --> 41:38.498
- I don't understand.

41:38.540 --> 41:40.542
- You don't underst--
look, I just--

41:40.583 --> 41:44.963
I needed to...climb
into the inside of something,

41:45.005 --> 41:47.632
so I decided
to get inside Vincent,

41:47.674 --> 41:51.594
to figure out, if he ran away,
why he would run away.

41:51.636 --> 41:54.014
It's fiction.
Honey, I made it up.

41:54.055 --> 41:55.557
It's nothing.
- This is sick.

41:55.598 --> 41:58.393
- This is what writers do.
We channel.

41:58.435 --> 41:59.644
Kafka, Sondheim.

41:59.686 --> 42:01.563
They look into the souls
of themselves,

42:01.604 --> 42:04.065
into the souls of others,
and they channel.

42:04.107 --> 42:05.859
That's what I was trying to do
with Vincent,

42:05.900 --> 42:10.113
to feel
what he might be feeling.

42:10.155 --> 42:13.742
To get the reader to feel that.
That's all, baby.

42:13.783 --> 42:16.077
It's okay. That's all.

42:16.119 --> 42:19.831
[suspenseful music]

42:19.873 --> 42:22.876
- I don't believe you.

42:22.917 --> 42:24.753
You've done something.

42:26.546 --> 42:30.592
You've done something
to Vincent.

42:30.633 --> 42:36.181
* *
