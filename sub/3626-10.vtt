Gossip Girl here...
your one and only source

00:03.568 --> 00:05.440
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.527 --> 00:07.050
Ever since you walked
into the gallery last week

00:07.137 --> 00:08.486
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about you.

00:08.573 --> 00:09.835
Is it too weird
to think that maybe

00:09.922 --> 00:11.446
fate brought us
back together again?

00:11.533 --> 00:13.448
I was up all night finishing
the story for Noah Shapiro.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.058
The guy from "The Paris Review"?

00:15.145 --> 00:16.277
- Which story?
- The one about Chuck Bass.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.235
You said you couldn't
write that story.

00:18.322 --> 00:19.541
No, I could always write it.
I-I chose not to.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.195
You should do
your own clothing line.

00:21.282 --> 00:23.327
I can model them.
Max will do some photos.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.676
If you think you're getting away
with this tonight

00:24.763 --> 00:26.026
you are dead wrong.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.810
[Jenny]
'It's too late.
It's done.'

00:30.987 --> 00:32.510
And who am I?

00:32.597 --> 00:35.905
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.341
You know you love me.

00:37.428 --> 00:40.736
X-O-X-O, Gossip Girl.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.180
You're in for a real treat,
son.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.748
I even amazed myself
with this bolognese.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.271
I'm amazed at how calm
you're acting.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.403
Your 15-year-old daughter's
moved in

00:55.490 --> 00:57.927
with her crazy model friend.

00:58.014 --> 01:01.670
And with the model's mother,
whom I met today for lunch.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.412
Granted, Agnes' mother's more
Courtney Love than June Cleaver

01:04.499 --> 01:06.414
but she's a committed parent

01:06.501 --> 01:09.112
and she's gone through
similar phases with Agnes.

01:09.199 --> 01:12.376
She promises to call
every day, so Jenny's safe.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.074
You're gonna act like
you're cool with it

01:14.161 --> 01:16.250
so she choosesto come home
instead of being forced.

01:16.337 --> 01:19.470
Well, that's, uh, that's risky,
but I like it.

01:19.557 --> 01:22.212
- I hope it works.
- Yeah.

01:22.299 --> 01:23.561
So you ready
for the best sauce ever?

01:23.648 --> 01:25.085
Uh, you know, actually
I can't stay.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.261
I'm gonna meet
Shapiro, and I know you don't

01:27.348 --> 01:29.828
agree with me writing a story
about Chuck and his mother--

01:29.915 --> 01:31.700
I don't believe in using other
people to get what you want.

01:31.787 --> 01:34.050
Well, Shapiro loved the story.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.444
He's writing me
the recommendation for Yale.

01:36.531 --> 01:40.796
Congratulations.
I'm happy for ya.

01:40.883 --> 01:43.668
I'm happy for you
and your sister both.

01:43.755 --> 01:46.018
[scoffs]
Well, I'm glad
you're a musician

01:46.106 --> 01:49.805
and not an actor, dad, 'cause
our family would have starved.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.850
Save me some cold pasta?

01:51.937 --> 01:53.852
I'll leave it on the stove
for you.

01:53.939 --> 01:55.680
Alright.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.813

[Blair]
'Though it seems like
just yesterday'

02:01.425 --> 02:03.210
Serena and I were 8
and playing dress-up

02:03.297 --> 02:04.950
in my mother's vintage Manolos

02:05.037 --> 02:07.039
my 18th birthday
has finally arrived.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.084
[all chuckling]

02:08.171 --> 02:09.868
The party needs to be perfect

02:09.955 --> 02:11.261
so blood orange martinis

02:11.348 --> 02:12.567
or beluga and belvedere?

02:12.654 --> 02:13.959
Why don't we make
different drinks tonight

02:14.046 --> 02:15.135
and do a taste test?

02:15.222 --> 02:16.527
Oh, I can't.

02:16.614 --> 02:19.095
I'm meeting
my mother's new boyfriend.

02:19.182 --> 02:22.577
Even momshave boyfriends,
and I don't.

02:22.664 --> 02:25.275
'Cyrus has been one of my mom's
attorneys since the divorce.'

02:25.362 --> 02:26.711
He asked her out
when they first met

02:26.798 --> 02:28.626
but she didn't wanna mix
business with pleasure.

02:28.713 --> 02:31.151
'Finally, his amorous overtures
wore her down'

02:31.238 --> 02:34.328
and she agreed to dinner.
She's been smitten ever since.

02:34.415 --> 02:36.678
Oh, that's so romantic.

02:36.765 --> 02:39.071
One thing my mom has
is good taste in men.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.509
Maybe a dashing stepdad
is just what I need.

02:41.596 --> 02:45.687
Speaking of good taste in men,
how's the sexy artist, Serena?

02:45.774 --> 02:47.602
Oh, uh, Aaron's amazing.

02:47.689 --> 02:50.561
He's been sending me these maps
to the most beautiful places.

02:50.648 --> 02:53.564
The other day I ended up in
a private room in the cloisters

02:53.651 --> 02:54.739
overlooking the gardens.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.350
Spare them the details,
Serena.

02:56.437 --> 02:57.829
Hazel will kill herself
from envy.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.091

03:00.789 --> 03:03.400
Oh, this is him again.
I gotta go.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.620
What? What about my party?

03:05.707 --> 03:07.143
Blood orange martinis
all the way.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.320
You girls have been
getting a lot of press.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.017
You got talent.

03:12.104 --> 03:13.367
- Who's the designer?
- It's me.

03:13.454 --> 03:14.803
And I'm the face of the line

03:14.890 --> 03:16.805
and the brains
behind the operation.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.633
Who do you imagine
your client will be?

03:18.720 --> 03:20.330
Girls like us.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.071
Sophisticated girls with
a bit of edge who can afford

03:22.158 --> 03:24.073
high-end product, and I know
these girls and their style

03:24.160 --> 03:26.162
because I'm their peer,
so that's what makes me unique

03:26.249 --> 03:27.424
as a designer.

03:27.511 --> 03:29.470
Hmm. What's the name
of the label?

03:29.557 --> 03:30.471
- Vixen Dresses, Inc.
- J. Humphrey designs.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.124
'We haven't fully decided yet'

03:32.212 --> 03:34.475
clearly, but, uh,
it really doesn't matter

03:34.562 --> 03:36.172
'cause we're just here to take
the work to the next level.

03:36.259 --> 03:39.001
Definitely, which means finding
a clear vision for the brand.

03:39.088 --> 03:41.438
Which since fashion is
a designer-based industry

03:41.525 --> 03:43.745
and I'm a designer,
that brand would be me.

03:43.832 --> 03:47.096
The brand is the concept,
which we both came up with.

03:47.183 --> 03:48.053
'Agnes, can we just talk
about this later'

03:48.140 --> 03:49.446
when we're alone, please?

03:49.533 --> 03:51.187
No, we're gonna talk
about this now.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.972
I mean, if Mr. Smith here
wants to represent us

03:54.059 --> 03:55.235
then he should know
who he's dealing with.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.062
Except Mr. Smith
might get the wrong idea

03:57.149 --> 03:58.194
about our professionalism.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.282
Well, then cut the crap

03:59.369 --> 04:00.675
and start acting professional

04:00.762 --> 04:02.242
instead of putting
on "The Jenny Show."

04:02.329 --> 04:04.679
Me? Agnes, look at who's
acting out yet again

04:04.766 --> 04:06.028
in another business meeting.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.725
You wanna see acting out?

04:09.423 --> 04:11.512
And yet another one
bites the dust, Agnes.

04:11.599 --> 04:14.079
What is the matter with you?
This guy was our last chance.

04:14.166 --> 04:17.692
Okay, he totally overreacted.
I mean, we're artists.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.042
We need to work with somebody
who's not gonna be freaked out

04:20.129 --> 04:21.043
by a little bit of passion.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.740
Passion? You know the heat..

04:22.827 --> 04:23.698
...from the fashion show's
not gonna last that long.

04:23.785 --> 04:25.569
Okay, Jenny

04:25.656 --> 04:27.789
I will find us another
business manager tomorrow.

04:27.876 --> 04:30.574
Good, because until we get one,
we can't meet with any buyers.

04:30.661 --> 04:33.447
Yes. Okay? Now it's all
gonna work out, alright?

04:33.534 --> 04:34.448
And I'm on it.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.235
- Dorota.
- Dorota!

04:39.322 --> 04:41.150
Hurry up.
Cyrus will be here any minute.

04:41.237 --> 04:46.111
He is the most attractive,
brilliant man I have ever met.

04:46.198 --> 04:47.199
Darling,
you're gonna love him.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.940
I kind of already do.

04:49.027 --> 04:51.203
I'm so excited to meet him.

04:51.291 --> 04:58.036
I told you to put the roses on
the table next to Cyrus' seat.

04:58.123 --> 05:00.909
Cary Grant always looked
his best with white roses.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.911
Dorota, are you insane?

05:02.998 --> 05:05.435
- I don't know.
- You used the everyday China.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.959
Cyrus will think we're just
common upper middle class.

05:08.046 --> 05:09.918
Go get the objet,
and hurry up.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.136
[elevator bell dings]
Yes, Miss Blair.

05:11.223 --> 05:14.618
Ah, Eleanor,
you look like a goddess.

05:14.705 --> 05:16.098
That must be his driver.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.624
Not enough! Ha ha ha.

05:26.891 --> 05:30.504
Darling,
come meet Cyrus Rose.

Not enough! Ha ha ha.

Happy 20th anniversary
for Bass Industries.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.134
Surprised you remembered.

05:52.221 --> 05:56.268
Not only did I remember,
I got you something.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.835
You once told me
that you snuck

05:57.922 --> 05:59.968
into hockey games as a kid,
sat in the back row.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.665
You bought a box
for the season?

06:01.752 --> 06:04.494
I thought you could revisit
your childhood passion in style.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.757
We can go to Rangers games
together, hang out.

06:06.844 --> 06:11.806
Well, nice gesture,
but, uh, misguided as usual.

06:11.893 --> 06:15.549
I don't have time for
hockey games. You know that.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.522
I always knew you had chops,
Humphrey.

06:32.609 --> 06:35.177
Here's your letter.
Have a seat.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.048
Thank you, sir.
Thank you so much.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.137
Don't thank me yet.
There's more to come.

06:39.224 --> 06:42.489
Meet James Wolf, senior editor
at "New York" magazine.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.142
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

06:44.229 --> 06:45.796
Shapiro took the liberty
of showing me your piece.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.408
I'm very interested.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.584
Oh, well, I'm, uh,
I'm flattered.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.499
"New York" magazine doesn't
normally publish fiction.

06:52.586 --> 06:54.718
It's not really fiction,
though, is it?

06:54.805 --> 06:56.894
I told James
the "Trout" character

06:56.981 --> 07:00.028
is based on Chuck Bass,
son of Bartholomew.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.596
It's the 20th anniversary
of Bass Industries.

07:02.683 --> 07:05.990
We want an exposé
on the man behind the company.

07:06.077 --> 07:08.993
You dated the stepdaughter.
You know the son.

07:09.080 --> 07:12.606
Yeah, look, the last thing
I need is Bart Bass as an enemy.

07:12.693 --> 07:15.304
Yeah, and I'm really not
the undercover type.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.088
If you're afraid
of the man's wrath

07:17.175 --> 07:19.439
we won't print your name,
but if your reporting's

07:19.526 --> 07:22.485
as good as your fiction,
I'll assign you another piece.

07:22.572 --> 07:25.053
Look, I'm...I'm sorry, sir,
but he's not an idiot.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.229
If I milk him for information
and you print it

07:27.316 --> 07:29.144
he's...he's gonna know
it came from me.

07:29.231 --> 07:31.755
We'll only print something if
it's true and can be verified.

07:31.842 --> 07:34.105
If the man's clean,
the story goes away.

07:34.192 --> 07:36.325
If he's not, well,
that's on him, isn't it?

07:39.154 --> 07:41.243
You just grew a pair, Humphrey.

I mean, it's amazing, but why?

Well, you know,
I've shown you

like Picasso.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.984
Serena, a guy starts out
in his blue period

09:54.071 --> 09:56.204
and everything's great,
but it's only a matter of time

09:56.291 --> 09:58.467
before he's all into cubism
and it's some other girl's eye

09:58.554 --> 09:59.729
coming out of her forehead.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.513
Okay, I'm gonna go.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.212
Wait! No, what about the gnome?
I have to take him down.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.693
B, enough already.
You always said you wanted to be

10:06.780 --> 10:08.912
an elegant woman at 18
like Grace Kelly.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.960
You're right.
I'm going to be an adult.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.135
I'll try and tolerate him.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.267
Good girl.

10:18.879 --> 10:20.228
Well, this has been great.

10:20.315 --> 10:22.273
Mr. Bass, thank you for
answering my questions.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.666
Anything for a friend
of Serena's.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.146
As I mentioned, I'm just..

10:25.233 --> 10:26.408
...I'm kinda over
the writing thing

10:26.495 --> 10:28.105
and I wanna see
what else is out there.

10:28.192 --> 10:30.499
Um, you're easily the most
successful person I know

10:30.586 --> 10:33.415
so I figured why not start
at the top, right?

10:33.502 --> 10:35.547
Yeah, I was hoping that
I might be able to shadow you

10:35.635 --> 10:37.375
for just a few days a week
after school.

10:38.550 --> 10:39.943
I'm a busy man, Daniel.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.336
I don't think
that's gonna be possible.

10:41.423 --> 10:42.642
Yeah, of course.
I don't want to impose.

10:42.729 --> 10:46.036
It's just, um...
you know, uh..

10:46.123 --> 10:48.560
Well, my dad,
his world is pretty narrow.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.780
You know? He may have had
a hit song in the '90s

10:50.867 --> 10:52.869
but he didn't build
half the Manhattan skyline.

10:52.956 --> 10:56.046
[chuckles]
Your father's
a fine man, but, um..

10:56.133 --> 10:59.223
...I can see how
you'd want something more.

10:59.310 --> 11:03.401
[sighs]
Why don't we start
with two days a week?

11:03.488 --> 11:05.795
That's, uh, that's more
than enough. Thank you.

11:09.016 --> 11:11.671
Agnes, it's three o' clock.
I have been waiting up for you

11:11.758 --> 11:13.324
at the apartment
since 8:00 this morning.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.283
Will you lower your voice?

11:15.370 --> 11:17.764
Your high-pitched shrill
is not helping my pounding head.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.504
- Excuse me?
- Um.

11:19.591 --> 11:22.420
Waitress, can I get,
um, a revive? Thank you.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.074
Where the hell were you?

11:24.161 --> 11:26.120
I went out with Max
last night

11:26.207 --> 11:27.512
and then we ran
into some friends

11:27.599 --> 11:30.211
and it was really good.
You should have come.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.603
Then you should have answered
your phone

11:31.691 --> 11:33.257
or at least turned it on

11:33.344 --> 11:35.390
so that you could hear
the 50 messages I left you.

11:35.477 --> 11:37.131
What are you, my mother?

11:37.218 --> 11:40.134
No, Agnes, I am your partner!
And you promised

11:40.221 --> 11:41.657
that you'd find us
a new business manager today.

11:41.744 --> 11:44.834
And I will do it on Monday
or today

11:44.921 --> 11:46.836
if my hangover ever wears off.

11:46.923 --> 11:49.926
Do you understand how much
I've given up for this?

11:50.013 --> 11:53.756
- Yes.
- No, Agnes, you don't.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.627
I left home.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.020
I quit my job

11:57.107 --> 11:59.283
and my dad,
he basically hates me.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.068
You need to chill.

12:01.155 --> 12:05.463
Take a Xanax or a tequila shot
or something.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.074
[gagging]

12:09.293 --> 12:10.207
[coughing]

12:24.700 --> 12:27.616
Hi. This is Jenny Humphrey.
I'm calling for Scott Smith.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.445
Yeah, I know.
I met with him yesterday.

12:32.012 --> 12:32.926
'Well, again,
thank you for your time.'

12:33.013 --> 12:34.536
It's been a pleasure, Dan.

12:34.623 --> 12:37.191
- Listen, do you like hockey?
- Uh, sure, yeah.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.714
'I was thinking maybe I could
give you a business primer'

12:38.801 --> 12:41.282
over a Ranger game,
Tuesday night.

12:41.369 --> 12:42.892
Chuck,
what are you doing here?

12:42.979 --> 12:45.242
I'm sorry, sir. I told him
you were in a meeting.

12:45.329 --> 12:48.593
I came by to have Robert clear
your schedule for the game.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.987
Apparently
you already have a date.

12:51.074 --> 12:52.162
What are you doing here?

12:52.249 --> 12:53.642
Well, I'm,
uh, I'm newly interested

12:53.729 --> 12:56.123
in the construction business.
I thought..

12:56.210 --> 12:58.821
I thought your dad
could show me the ropes.

12:58.908 --> 13:01.215
I was just leaving.
Thank you, Mr. Bass.

13:07.351 --> 13:10.920
$18 a flower?
That's absurd.

13:11.007 --> 13:13.227
Yeah, yeah, it, uh,
it is a bit steep.

13:13.314 --> 13:15.403
Now, I'm an attorney,
and I'm telling you

13:15.490 --> 13:18.145
you're not paying
for that peony.

13:18.232 --> 13:22.279
You're paying for the florist's
Madison Avenue rent.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.934
[under breath]
I am Grace Kelly.
Grace Kelly is me.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.762
Blair, I would love

13:26.849 --> 13:30.287
to fill this whole penthouse
with peonies for you

13:30.374 --> 13:32.028
for your birthday,
but would you allow me

13:32.115 --> 13:33.813
to buy them someplace else?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.423
I mean, it's the principle
of the thing.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.729
I prefer to get my own peonies
from my own florist

13:37.817 --> 13:39.731
but...thank you so much.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.996
Well, Eleanor, over dinner

13:43.083 --> 13:45.389
you mentioned your fondness
for Cyndi Lauper.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.304
Mom and I love Cyndi Lauper.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.698
We used to re-enact
"Girls just want to have fun."

13:49.785 --> 13:51.743
- Our first DVD was "Vibes."
- Oh!

13:51.831 --> 13:56.923
[laughs]
Well, I got tickets to
see Cyndi Lauper at Joe's Pub

13:57.010 --> 13:59.142
tomorrow night, and that way,
your mother and I

13:59.229 --> 14:01.231
will be out of your hair
for the party.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.059
My mother's coming
to my party.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.540
What?! You never want me
at your parties.

14:05.627 --> 14:06.933
This year is different.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.196
I'm 18,
and it's a grown-up party.

14:09.283 --> 14:11.241
I e-mailed Dorota
a new guest list.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.591
- Parents are invited.
- We'll return the tickets.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.158
No, nonsense, nonsense.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.594
Blair and I will celebrate
her birthday

14:16.681 --> 14:18.683
on her realbirthday next week.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.947
We are going to see
Cyndi Lauper!

14:21.034 --> 14:21.948
Aah!

14:25.560 --> 14:27.301
Thank you so much
for giving me another chance.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.999
My, uh, ex-partner
had some issues

14:30.086 --> 14:32.523
so I've completely severed
all ties with her.

14:32.610 --> 14:34.003
I'm glad to hear it.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.875
I'd be delighted
to work with you alone.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.355
Really?
Uh, that's amazing.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.749
I'm sure we can get started
on the incorporation right away.

14:40.836 --> 14:43.404
- Uh, you are 18, aren't you?
- Actually, no, I'm 15.

14:43.491 --> 14:45.058
That's not a problem,
though, is it?

14:45.145 --> 14:47.147
No, no, not at all.
We just have to get the papers

14:47.234 --> 14:49.149
signed by a parent,
uh, but that's simple

14:49.236 --> 14:50.933
and then we're good to go.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.283
Awesome. Yeah, no problem.

14:56.286 --> 14:59.028
Uh, you can stand
right here.

14:59.115 --> 15:00.029
Okay.

15:04.338 --> 15:07.036
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:07.123 --> 15:11.432
So...um, tell me, uh,
when you're ready.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.216
I've been practicing
my poses.

15:13.303 --> 15:16.045
Okay, Zoolander.
Just give me a second.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.438
So...so what is it
that you want?

15:17.525 --> 15:19.440
You want, like,
a little bit of this?

15:19.527 --> 15:22.834
Or, like, you know,
some of this?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.314
I don't know.

15:24.401 --> 15:28.188
Uh...how about, um,
how about a little less?

15:28.275 --> 15:31.756
You know, uh, try being still.
Try...nothing.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.758
Okay.

15:33.845 --> 15:37.762
Um...we can try that.

Okay, okay.

at "New York" magazine?

16:38.693 --> 16:40.564
'Yeah. Why?'

What do you know about a guy
named Dan Humphrey?

he could bury the bone
in the backyard

and no one would find it?
Every Bass will have his day.

17:05.720 --> 17:10.159
Now how many muses come over in
the morning bearing breakfast?

17:10.246 --> 17:14.511
Oh, my gosh. You must have
stayed up all night making that.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.165
Pretty much.

17:16.252 --> 17:18.602
- Oh.
- What do you think?

17:18.689 --> 17:21.562
It's beautiful.

you know, seeing myself...
like this.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.836

I should probably be more cool
and mysterious and stop talking.

He wears sports socks.

He's short and pushy.
He's nothing like daddy.

I like him.

some big secret I can exploit

So if you got information,
I'm right here.

19:44.008 --> 19:46.794
Alright, in '87,
your friend Bass

19:46.881 --> 19:50.014
bought a building in midtown
to convert to condos.

19:50.101 --> 19:51.320
The market crashed,
and he couldn't raise

19:51.407 --> 19:52.756
the funds to complete it.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.497
So wouldn't you know?
That building burned down.

Are you saying
it wasn't an accident?

in "All the president's men."

no way this could be legit

the insurance, even.

for Kim-Ly was true love.

41:29.530 --> 41:32.141
are the ones
you spring on yourself.

41:32.228 --> 41:33.186
Come on.

41:35.754 --> 41:36.972
♪ Feels like you're dyin' ♪

41:37.059 --> 41:38.496
scampering about in a slip

41:38.583 --> 41:41.368
is one way to shed old skin.

41:41.455 --> 41:43.152

41:43.239 --> 41:47.156
be as easy as flinging off
a pair of Fendi flats?

41:47.243 --> 41:50.508
Looks like someone's
going barefoot in the park.
