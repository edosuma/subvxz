02:09.306 --> 02:10.672
You know what this
reminds me of? Um,

02:10.674 --> 02:13.541
When james caan was, uh,
fighting all those bad guys off

02:13.543 --> 02:15.376
With a cane in<i> the killer elite?</i>

02:15.378 --> 02:17.177
And they're all, like,
puh-puh, pow, pow!

02:17.179 --> 02:18.678
I'm pretty sure
it wasn't a candy cane.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.113
Uh, we're actually working

02:21.115 --> 02:22.881
On a toys for tots drive
with the marines.

02:22.883 --> 02:25.183
And we can do with a few
more volunteers, sir.

02:25.185 --> 02:26.250
Yeah.

02:30.456 --> 02:33.156
I'm guessing that's a no.

02:33.158 --> 02:34.790
Hetty:
Aha! Mr. Beale,

02:34.792 --> 02:36.525
And ms. Jones.

02:36.527 --> 02:38.393
Yes.

02:38.395 --> 02:40.561
There's been
an incident in montrose.

02:40.563 --> 02:42.696
I need you to look into it.
We're on it.

02:42.698 --> 02:44.164
With pleasure.
(clears her throat)

02:44.166 --> 02:45.665
Just gonna grab this.

02:47.135 --> 02:48.801
I told you we should
have locked the door.

02:48.803 --> 02:50.736
They were in here dancing.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.238
Don't be an old humbug, owen.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.640
Besides, I've
seen you dance, and

02:55.642 --> 02:58.175
They can't be worse than you.

02:58.177 --> 03:01.878
¶ toys for tots... ¶

03:01.880 --> 03:04.180
I don't dance.

03:13.691 --> 03:15.624
Seriously, g?

03:15.626 --> 03:18.293
No wreath, no christmas tree,
no menorah.

03:18.295 --> 03:20.194
So sad.

03:20.196 --> 03:21.228
So sad.

03:21.230 --> 03:22.662
Why? 'cause I don't get sucked

03:22.664 --> 03:24.196
Into the commercialism
of the holidays?

03:24.198 --> 03:26.231
'cause you're too
lazy to decorate.

03:26.233 --> 03:28.266
Excuse me?

03:29.902 --> 03:31.635
Oh, yeah, you're a
regular martha stewart.

03:31.637 --> 03:33.169
Thank you.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.237
Can we go now?

03:36.506 --> 03:39.173
Are you freaking kidding me?!

03:39.175 --> 03:41.575
Janvier sent you
a christmas card from prison?

03:41.577 --> 03:43.810
Every year.
What, you don't get one?

03:43.812 --> 03:45.878
The only other card
that you received is

03:45.880 --> 03:48.347
From a one-armed psychopath
who wants to kill you?

03:48.349 --> 03:50.182
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

03:50.184 --> 03:52.517
My aliases get
lots of cards.

03:52.519 --> 03:54.185
And why is it next to my family?

03:54.187 --> 03:56.253
It's the spirit of the season.

03:56.255 --> 03:58.888
Plus, I mean, you know,
it's a funny card. See?

03:58.890 --> 04:01.323
Snowman's melting
in the jacuzzi?

04:02.926 --> 04:04.325
Morning, sam.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.292
Morning, joelle.

04:09.764 --> 04:12.464
Christmas came early.

04:13.967 --> 04:15.933
This is none
of my business.

04:15.935 --> 04:18.102
Nope.

04:18.103 --> 04:20.270
But seeing as joelle is a
friend of michelle and me.

04:20.272 --> 04:22.438
Mm, pretty sure I'm a friend
of you and michelle.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.940
You are, and I don't want to
see either one of you get hurt.

04:24.942 --> 04:27.342
You said you were
breaking up with her.
I am.

04:27.344 --> 04:30.511
I did, but we're both gonna be
alone for the holidays, and...

04:30.513 --> 04:31.812
You're coming
to my place.

04:31.814 --> 04:33.580
That is not the same.
Nothing says

04:33.582 --> 04:36.416
"peace on earth and goodwill
toward men" like a booty call.

04:36.418 --> 04:38.584
Well, 'tis the season.

04:38.586 --> 04:43.255
Here, this'll cheer you up.

04:43.257 --> 04:46.458
Put the nose on the front,
antlers on the windows.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.359
Makes your car look
like rudolph.

04:48.361 --> 04:49.927
The hell it does.

04:49.929 --> 04:51.995
Oh, I get it.

04:51.997 --> 04:54.597
You give me grief over how
I decorate my house, but when

04:54.599 --> 04:57.232
I get you a gift to get you
in the holiday spirit...

04:57.234 --> 05:00.802
I'm not putting reindeer antlers
and a rudolph nose on my car!

05:00.804 --> 05:02.003
It's christmas!

05:02.005 --> 05:04.572
It's stupid!

05:05.541 --> 05:09.276
I'm warning you--
don't do it.

05:09.278 --> 05:11.678
Seriously, don't put that
on my car. Come on, g.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.846
It's coming off as soon
as we get to work.

05:13.848 --> 05:15.347
(humming)

05:15.349 --> 05:17.282
You play too much, man.

05:18.251 --> 05:21.719
(sighs)

05:21.721 --> 05:23.353
All right, well, now it is

05:23.355 --> 05:24.987
Gonna look stupid
with just one antler.

05:24.989 --> 05:27.289
(engine starting)
no.

05:27.291 --> 05:28.456
I should take you in

05:28.458 --> 05:30.357
For littering.

05:30.359 --> 05:32.959
¶ having ourselves
a snow-filled christmas... ¶

05:32.961 --> 05:35.027
It's one of the best
restaurants in la,

05:35.029 --> 05:36.762
And their christmas
dinner is supposed

05:36.764 --> 05:38.330
To be out of this world.

05:38.332 --> 05:39.531
Yeah, no. I know
it's your tradition.

05:39.533 --> 05:40.999
I'm just saying, we
start a new tradition.

05:41.001 --> 05:43.634
No. I know, but we want
to do this. This is our treat.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.969
Uh, just, you want to come
all this way just to slave

05:45.971 --> 05:47.971
Over a stove.
Are you sure about that?

05:47.973 --> 05:50.039
Yeah, okay.

05:50.041 --> 05:51.907
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

05:51.909 --> 05:55.010
Nope. Nope. It's fine.
All right.

05:55.012 --> 05:56.611
I will talk
to you later.
Okay.

05:56.613 --> 05:58.279
Okay.
All right.

05:58.281 --> 06:00.281
Bye.
Uh-huh. I'll
talk to you soon.

06:00.283 --> 06:02.483
I love you, too. Bye, mama.

06:02.485 --> 06:05.786
My mom is insisting
on cooking christmas dinner.

06:05.788 --> 06:07.621
<i> My</i> mom is insisting on cooking

06:07.623 --> 06:08.922
Christmas dinner.

06:08.924 --> 06:11.491
Hmm. Well, so,
they cook it together?

06:11.493 --> 06:12.825
Not a snowball's

06:12.827 --> 06:13.992
Chance in hell.

06:13.994 --> 06:15.793
My mom does not
play well with others,

06:15.795 --> 06:17.628
Especially in a kitchen
where there's sharp objects.

06:17.630 --> 06:18.996
Okay, so what do we do?

06:18.998 --> 06:20.330
I think we have to elope.

06:20.332 --> 06:22.332
What?
What?

06:22.334 --> 06:24.300
No. I mean, go off

06:24.302 --> 06:25.567
Alone, and spend
the holidays

06:25.569 --> 06:26.834
Alone. Not alone.

06:26.836 --> 06:28.902
Together, but alone.

06:28.904 --> 06:31.304
Not other people there.
Just you and I.

06:31.306 --> 06:32.738
So you're suggesting

06:32.740 --> 06:35.073
That we abandon our mothers
on christmas?

06:35.075 --> 06:36.941
Their only children?

06:36.943 --> 06:38.909
Yes?

06:38.911 --> 06:41.544
That's actually not a bad idea.

06:41.546 --> 06:43.045
Why do families have
to complicate everything?

06:43.047 --> 06:44.646
Oh, please. Wait till
you're married with kids,

06:44.648 --> 06:46.047
And you have two sets
of grandparents

06:46.049 --> 06:48.199
Fighting over
where you spend christmas.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.350
Deeks:
You know what? I'm just
gonna be optimistic about this.

06:50.353 --> 06:51.797
Maybe we get a big case,

06:51.798 --> 06:53.242
And we have to work
straight through the holidays.

06:53.243 --> 06:54.687
No, no, no, no, no.
I solved all my cases.

06:54.690 --> 06:56.322
I will not be working
during the holidays.

06:56.324 --> 06:58.324
Oh, you're not working.
No!

06:58.326 --> 07:00.392
Deeks:
Ah, looks like
you are now.

07:00.394 --> 07:01.977
Sam:
Oh, no, no, no, no. No.

07:01.978 --> 07:03.561
Back to your cyber
cave, jingle bells.

07:03.563 --> 07:05.029
No, I'm not in the mood.

07:05.031 --> 07:05.929
Go.

07:05.931 --> 07:07.330
Deeks:
Be gentle.

07:07.332 --> 07:08.097
Sam:
Go!

07:08.099 --> 07:09.731
Bah, humbug.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.833
Kensi: Sam, he's cute!
Sam:
It's ridiculous.

07:11.835 --> 07:13.067
You broke his little
elfin heart.

07:13.069 --> 07:14.401
You better watch out
on christmas, sam.

07:14.403 --> 07:17.036
Santa's always
watching.

07:17.038 --> 07:18.688
It's kind of like hetty.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.339
Come to think of it,
she does have an elfin quality,

07:20.341 --> 07:22.474
And probably could
fit down the chimney.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.942
(hetty clears her throat)

07:25.578 --> 07:28.512
What are you looking at me for?
Deeks said it.

07:29.915 --> 07:31.514
Eric:
Jason lam was recently added

07:31.516 --> 07:33.115
To the homeland security
watch list.

07:33.117 --> 07:34.916
Officially, he owned
a furniture store,

07:34.918 --> 07:36.417
But he was
suspected of spying

07:36.419 --> 07:38.452
For the democratic
people's republic of korea.

07:38.454 --> 07:40.921
He was also killed this morning.

07:40.923 --> 07:42.589
Deeks:
Dprk.

07:42.591 --> 07:43.923
Any leads?
Eric:
Yeah.

07:43.925 --> 07:45.658
Mike hobbs, a convicted felon,

07:45.660 --> 07:47.593
Released from prison yesterday.

07:47.595 --> 07:48.827
Is he a suspect?

07:48.829 --> 07:51.263
Yeah, person
of interest.
Before hobbs

07:51.264 --> 07:53.698
Was locked up, he and lam did
some business deals together.

07:53.700 --> 07:57.368
He ran an import-export business
moving goods out of asia.

07:57.370 --> 07:58.769
Now, it could be
just a coincidence,

07:58.771 --> 08:01.471
But even if hobbs has nothing
to do with lam's death,

08:01.473 --> 08:03.372
He may know someone who did.

08:03.374 --> 08:05.140
What was hobbs moving?
Metals, diamonds, organs?

08:05.142 --> 08:08.409
Handbags, actually.
Oh.

08:08.411 --> 08:10.411
About a half a mil counterfeit
before the fbi busted him.

08:10.413 --> 08:13.380
Maybe lam was just trying to get
a deal on a purse for his wife.
(laughs)

08:13.382 --> 08:16.015
Or maybe she found out
he got her a fake bag.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.517
He also ran into traffic
and was hit by a truck.

08:18.519 --> 08:20.886
Sounds like a suicide to me.
I can handle this one alone.

08:20.888 --> 08:22.888
Hobbs is not dangerous,
and if it involves

08:22.890 --> 08:24.756
Any north korean spies,
I'll call in for help.

08:24.758 --> 08:26.858
I'll go with callen.
It's a two-man job.

08:26.860 --> 08:28.059
Excuse me?

08:28.061 --> 08:29.827
Uh, no, no. I mean, uh,

08:29.829 --> 08:31.895
One man
and an equally-capable woman

08:31.897 --> 08:33.529
Could also do the job,
but I don't want

08:33.531 --> 08:34.763
Callen to do it alone,

08:34.765 --> 08:36.464
And you guys both have
family obligations.

08:36.466 --> 08:37.698
Oh, we have
family obligations?

08:37.700 --> 08:39.666
What about mommy deeks?
My mom.

08:39.668 --> 08:42.168
That's a good point. I should
probably maybe bring my mom.

08:42.170 --> 08:44.136
You want to meet
my mama, g-willikers?

08:44.138 --> 08:46.805
Curious as I am to meet someone
who shares your dna, deeks,

08:46.807 --> 08:47.972
I will, uh, pass.

08:47.974 --> 08:49.173
I'm gonna handle
this myself.

08:49.175 --> 08:51.542
You're not going alone.
Let's make it quick.

08:51.544 --> 08:53.443
I have to pick up aiden
from the airport.

08:53.445 --> 08:54.577
Where's hobbs?

08:54.579 --> 08:56.612
Uh, he checked
into the sea shore motel

08:56.614 --> 08:58.914
In santa monica last night,
room 215.

08:58.916 --> 09:01.850
Where was lam murdered?

09:01.851 --> 09:04.785
Montrose betwixt honolulu ave
and ocean view boulevard.

09:04.788 --> 09:06.621
We should probably go check
that out for clues and stuff.

09:06.623 --> 09:08.122
Clues and stuff?

09:08.124 --> 09:10.791
Is that something
you picked up at lapd?

09:10.793 --> 09:12.125
I did learn that at lapd.

09:12.127 --> 09:14.160
Not only did I get
the highest marks in my class,

09:14.162 --> 09:15.961
But I was also voted best hair.

09:15.963 --> 09:17.028
Don't...

09:17.030 --> 09:18.895
Be jealous. Shotgun!

09:22.433 --> 09:25.200
Christmas can't come
soon enough.

09:41.617 --> 09:43.617
You guys exchanging gifts?

09:43.619 --> 09:45.685
What?
You and joelle?

09:45.687 --> 09:47.219
If you're spending
christmas together.

09:47.221 --> 09:50.155
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm way too smart for that.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.957
Oh, you think so?
I know so.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.458
I suggested that we give

09:54.460 --> 09:56.526
To each other's
favorite charity.

09:56.528 --> 09:59.095
Oh, boy.
What's wrong with that?

09:59.097 --> 10:00.863
Christmas is
about giving,

10:00.865 --> 10:03.632
And who better to give to
than those less fortunate?

10:03.634 --> 10:04.833
Starting to sound like

10:04.835 --> 10:06.801
Deeks's knuckleheadedness
rubbed off on you.

10:06.803 --> 10:08.836
I'm pretty sure
that's not a word.

10:08.838 --> 10:10.704
I'm pretty sure she
bought you something.

10:10.706 --> 10:12.706
No. We agreed.
It doesn't matter.

10:12.708 --> 10:14.391
Even if it's
something small,

10:14.392 --> 10:16.075
If you two wake up together
on christmas morning,

10:16.078 --> 10:18.678
I guarantee you she'll
have bought you something.
Why?

10:18.680 --> 10:20.479
Women are more
thoughtful than men.

10:20.481 --> 10:22.614
It's christmas, she
cares about you.

10:22.616 --> 10:24.816
At the very least, you
should have backup plan.

10:24.818 --> 10:26.150
Like what?

10:26.152 --> 10:28.552
The emergency gift.

10:28.554 --> 10:30.554
You don't need it, you don't use
it, but it's there if you do.

10:30.556 --> 10:33.189
Ah. Like a backup weapon.
I was thinking

10:33.191 --> 10:35.558
More earrings than
an ankle gun but yeah.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.893
I like it.

10:37.895 --> 10:39.561
Mike hobbs,
federal agents.

10:39.563 --> 10:41.129
We have a couple
of questions.

10:41.131 --> 10:43.197
Got a body.

10:48.837 --> 10:51.037
Clear.

10:53.007 --> 10:54.673
He's still alive.

10:54.675 --> 10:55.674
Mike hobbs?

10:55.676 --> 10:56.841
Call 911.

10:56.843 --> 10:59.076
More like aa.

10:59.078 --> 10:59.843
(retching)

10:59.845 --> 11:00.910
Oh!

11:00.912 --> 11:01.810
Oh, come on.

11:01.812 --> 11:02.911
(laughs)

11:02.913 --> 11:03.912
(retching)
oh!

11:03.914 --> 11:06.014
On
my boots?

11:06.016 --> 11:08.883
Now, that is a lot
of holiday cheer.
Hobbs: Ugh.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.919
Much better.
He is not getting in my car.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.921
(groans)
well,

11:13.923 --> 11:16.089
Told you ought to let me do
this one alone.

11:16.091 --> 11:18.758
You think it's funny.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.760
Thank you.
It's the least
I can do for christmas.

11:20.762 --> 11:24.764
Because it's a good charity,
and... Hi. How are you?

11:24.766 --> 11:26.766
What?
Happy holidays.

11:26.768 --> 11:29.935
Really, sweetheart?
I'm working and you're perving.

11:29.937 --> 11:32.938
How dare you? I wasn't perving.
It's a witness to a crime.

11:32.940 --> 11:34.105
Oh. What did she witness?

11:34.107 --> 11:35.639
Uh, not much, actually.

11:35.641 --> 11:37.107
Lam was hit
by a christmas tree truck,

11:37.109 --> 11:38.975
Which is morosely ironic.

11:38.977 --> 11:41.043
Unless, of course, he's jewish.

11:41.045 --> 11:44.046
Well, the toy shop's
security cameras don't record.

11:44.048 --> 11:45.947
It's just a deterrent.
But did you find

11:45.949 --> 11:47.615
Any other, uh, "clues or stuff,"

11:47.617 --> 11:50.117
Other than what's propping up
mrs. Claus's bikini?
Wow.

11:50.119 --> 11:52.119
Nothing else,
but I'm sure somebody else did,

11:52.121 --> 11:54.988
'cause three guys came by,
gave donations, took selfies.

11:54.990 --> 11:58.324
You combine that with all
the tour buses going by, and...
And

11:58.326 --> 12:00.726
You ask eric to scour
through social media,

12:00.728 --> 12:03.028
In case anybody posted anything
from that time.

12:03.030 --> 12:03.962
Tannenbaum!

12:04.965 --> 12:06.864
Sorry, that's christmas
for "bingo."

12:06.866 --> 12:08.799
Oh, I got it.
Mrs. Claus taught me that.

12:08.801 --> 12:10.100
Speaking of sexy
mrs. Claus,

12:10.102 --> 12:11.634
You know who would look
good in that outfit?

12:11.636 --> 12:12.901
Don't say hetty!

12:12.903 --> 12:14.569
Oh, wow. Wasn't
gonna say hetty.

12:14.571 --> 12:16.037
But now that you
mention it...
Deeks.

12:16.039 --> 12:18.839
I was talking
about you. Yeah.

12:18.841 --> 12:21.641
Why is it that men always expect
women to dress in lingerie

12:21.643 --> 12:23.242
For them, and yet
it's fine for them to be

12:23.244 --> 12:24.977
In a stained t-shirt
and ripped underwear?

12:24.979 --> 12:26.845
That's a totally valid
point. You want to switch?

12:26.847 --> 12:28.713
You can rock the, uh, stained
t-shirt and ripped underwear,

12:28.715 --> 12:31.315
And I'll put on the sexy
lingerie. A sexy teddy.

12:31.317 --> 12:35.919
Not a teddy, but I've always had
a thing for a sexy mr. Claus.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.720
Wait, are you serious?
Hmm.

12:37.722 --> 12:40.189
'cause I can make that happen.
Tie you up with a bow,

12:40.191 --> 12:43.258
Unwrap you like a present.
Oh, girl.

12:43.260 --> 12:44.792
Unbelievable.

12:44.794 --> 12:46.059
I'd ask you
where you were last night,

12:46.061 --> 12:48.227
But I'm pretty sure
it was where we found you.

12:48.229 --> 12:51.196
Not that you'd
remember.

12:52.365 --> 12:55.099
You don't have anything stronger
than aspirin?

12:55.101 --> 12:57.901
Don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

12:57.903 --> 12:59.969
Is he quoting baretta?

12:59.971 --> 13:02.104
Who killed
jason lam?

13:02.106 --> 13:03.371
Who?

13:03.373 --> 13:04.905
Jason lam.

13:04.907 --> 13:08.241
You worked with him. Remember?

13:08.243 --> 13:11.077
He looks kind of familiar.
He's dead?

13:11.079 --> 13:12.645
Yeah, he's dead.

13:12.647 --> 13:14.813
Well, don't look at me.
I've been in prison.

13:14.815 --> 13:16.080
It's kind of funny
that he turned up dead

13:16.082 --> 13:18.048
The day after you were released.

13:18.050 --> 13:19.382
You think that's funny?

13:19.384 --> 13:21.684
It's not funny.
It's, uh, tragic.

13:21.686 --> 13:23.252
Coincidental.
I'm pretty sure

13:23.254 --> 13:26.188
A lot of bad things could have
happened since I got out.

13:26.190 --> 13:29.024
You know anybody that would want
to have jason lam killed?

13:29.026 --> 13:31.993
I don't know. What did he do?

13:31.995 --> 13:33.260
He owned a furniture store.

13:33.262 --> 13:36.296
Ah. Well, then I
probably did business with him.

13:36.298 --> 13:38.698
I brought in stuff
from asia all the time.

13:38.700 --> 13:41.184
Like counterfeit handbags.

13:41.185 --> 13:43.669
I did my time,
and I'm done with that life.
Yeah?

13:43.671 --> 13:45.704
What about espionage?

13:45.706 --> 13:47.172
(scoffs)

13:47.174 --> 13:48.773
Did I miss something?

13:48.775 --> 13:51.842
Jason lam was suspected
of being a north korean spy.

13:51.844 --> 13:53.143
A spy?

13:53.145 --> 13:55.044
Really?

13:55.046 --> 13:56.745
That's kind of cool.

13:56.747 --> 13:58.012
He thinks it's cool.
Well,
I've never

13:58.014 --> 13:59.980
Met a real spy before.

13:59.982 --> 14:01.047
So you admit that
you've met him.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.081
You guys just said I did.

14:02.083 --> 14:04.049
Okay,
if he was

14:04.051 --> 14:06.184
A north korean spy
and now he's dead,

14:06.186 --> 14:08.952
Isn't that a good thing?

14:10.355 --> 14:12.054
(scoffs)

14:12.056 --> 14:13.255
(door opens)

14:13.257 --> 14:16.191
(sighs)
this is pointless.

14:16.193 --> 14:18.259
I'm gonna go pick up my son.
This guy's an idiot.

14:18.261 --> 14:20.361
No wonder he went to jail.

14:20.363 --> 14:22.262
Drop me off so I can check in
with kensi and deeks.

14:22.264 --> 14:24.181
Call me when you get done
with aiden.

14:24.182 --> 14:26.099
Probably have this
closed up by then.
Okay.

14:30.171 --> 14:32.304
What you're seeing is
everything we could scour

14:32.306 --> 14:34.973
From around the time
of jason lam's death--

14:34.975 --> 14:37.976
Twitter, instagram, facebook,
snapchat, you name it.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.044
It's a little choppy,
but when we knit it all together

14:40.046 --> 14:42.146
You get a pretty good look
at things.

14:42.147 --> 14:44.247
Eric: That's him in the green.
Callen:
Looks like he stumbles.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.684
Eric:
Then a few seconds later,
we caught this reflection.

14:47.686 --> 14:50.053
Who's he looking at?
We don't have
an angle.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.156
What else have
you got?

14:53.158 --> 14:54.423
Looks like he's having
a heart attack.

14:54.425 --> 14:56.091
Go back to the very beginning.

14:56.093 --> 14:57.192
Play it frame by frame.

15:00.997 --> 15:04.465
You see that?
Can you clear that up?
Mm-hmm.

15:05.468 --> 15:07.334
She hit him in the leg
with something.

15:07.336 --> 15:09.169
Call the coroner.
Have him check his right thigh

15:09.171 --> 15:11.104
For a puncture wound.
Have them run

15:11.106 --> 15:12.839
A full toxicology screening.

15:12.841 --> 15:15.308
Check for any exotic poisons,
nerve agents.

15:15.310 --> 15:17.243
But the truck
is what killed him.

15:17.245 --> 15:20.179
That may be, but he was
probably minutes from death

15:20.181 --> 15:23.048
And he knew it. That's why
he looked back at the woman.

15:23.050 --> 15:25.250
She's the one we need to find.

15:51.444 --> 15:55.245
What are you doing?

15:55.247 --> 15:56.846
Meditating.

15:56.848 --> 16:00.082
You just meditated
through 200 rounds.

16:01.051 --> 16:03.885
You need something?

16:03.887 --> 16:06.187
What is bothering you?

16:06.189 --> 16:07.888
Don't you have a plane to catch?
No.

16:07.890 --> 16:10.223
Not while north korean agents

16:10.225 --> 16:13.226
Are running around
in our backyard.

16:13.228 --> 16:15.995
We got that covered.

16:15.997 --> 16:19.465
I understand that not
everyone enjoys the holidays.

16:19.467 --> 16:22.468
Terrorism doesn't take holidays,
henrietta.

16:22.470 --> 16:24.036
No.

16:24.038 --> 16:27.339
But we need to
every now and then.

16:27.341 --> 16:29.274
Okay.

16:29.276 --> 16:32.477
Pencil me in for easter.

16:37.283 --> 16:40.083
(door opens)

16:41.486 --> 16:44.253
What's this?
It was found in lam's car.

16:44.255 --> 16:46.388
Kensi: Is that an epipen?
Could be. I'm
guessing it was filled

16:46.390 --> 16:49.290
With something other
than epinephrine, maybe
something to counteract whatever

16:49.292 --> 16:51.558
This blonde jammed him with.
Lab's running tests on it.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.226
He was running to his car
because he knew

16:53.228 --> 16:54.794
He had the antidote.
He also knew

16:54.796 --> 16:55.928
That he didn't have long.

16:55.930 --> 16:58.330
Whatever that is,
it works very fast.

16:58.332 --> 17:00.298
And if he had the antidote...
He knew exactly

17:00.300 --> 17:01.966
What the poison was.
Which suggests

17:01.968 --> 17:03.400
They were playing
for the same team.

17:03.402 --> 17:05.268
Not anymore.
If lam

17:05.270 --> 17:08.004
Was a dprk agent and
they found out he had been made,

17:08.006 --> 17:09.989
They may have decided
to sever ties

17:09.990 --> 17:11.973
With him in order to protect
the rest of the network.

17:11.976 --> 17:13.442
That's a tough breakup.

17:13.444 --> 17:15.177
First thing to do
is eliminate the agent.

17:15.179 --> 17:17.312
Next, wipe out his history.
It means

17:17.314 --> 17:18.980
We need to move fast if we're
gonna find any information.

17:18.982 --> 17:21.315
I'll take lam's furniture store.
You take his residence.

17:21.317 --> 17:22.382
Done.

17:25.353 --> 17:27.953
Hey. Any luck
finding blondie?

17:27.955 --> 17:30.656
(sighs)
are you kidding me?

17:30.657 --> 17:33.358
This is los angeles. You can't
spit without hitting a blonde.

17:33.360 --> 17:34.826
No offense.

17:34.827 --> 17:36.293
You'll miss us
when we're extinct.

17:36.296 --> 17:38.429
So, what's
happening here?

17:38.431 --> 17:41.298
Oh, I just, uh,
smuggled in

17:41.300 --> 17:43.833
A little something to help
keep up our strength

17:43.835 --> 17:45.301
And holiday spirit.

17:45.303 --> 17:47.369
A little cookie
contraband?

17:47.371 --> 17:48.837
Yeah. You know it.

17:48.839 --> 17:50.438
Mmm. Cheers,

17:50.440 --> 17:52.206
Brother.
Cheers.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.241
(moans)

17:54.243 --> 17:56.176
I feel better already.
Oh, yeah.

17:56.178 --> 17:58.545
Nothing like a
little christmas sugar.
Mm-hmm.

17:58.547 --> 18:00.413
I think it gives me
magical holiday powers,

18:00.415 --> 18:03.315
Like santa claus.
Okay, mr. Kringle,

18:03.317 --> 18:05.216
How did she know where lam
was gonna be shopping?

18:05.218 --> 18:06.584
She was probably
following him.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.319
Okay. So if we
backtrack his movements

18:08.321 --> 18:10.387
Based on his cell
phone signal...

18:10.389 --> 18:12.389
Mmm. We can spot her
following him, get a license.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.190
Exactly.

18:14.192 --> 18:16.225
These cookies are working.
Oh, yeah.

18:16.227 --> 18:18.293
We should probably
get some more, right?

18:20.897 --> 18:23.097
If you could have anything
for christmas, what would it be?

18:23.099 --> 18:25.099
Anything?
Anything.

18:25.101 --> 18:27.901
Baby tiger.
What? A baby tiger?

18:27.903 --> 18:29.903
They're very cute.
Yeah, until they grow up

18:29.905 --> 18:32.372
To be a full-size tiger
and maul you to death.

18:32.374 --> 18:34.640
No. I would raise this one
from a cub. It would love me.

18:34.642 --> 18:37.275
Plus, josephine baker had
a cheetah.
Yeah,

18:37.277 --> 18:38.542
And nigerian warlords
have hyenas.

18:38.544 --> 18:40.944
Because they're
nigerian warlords.

18:40.946 --> 18:42.578
Okay. That would actually be
pretty badass, too.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.379
But, you know what,
I would prefer to have

18:44.381 --> 18:46.247
A tiger, and I would train it
to work with me.

18:46.249 --> 18:47.948
Oh, my gosh,
that would be so cool.

18:47.950 --> 18:49.115
Imagine me busting
through this door,

18:49.117 --> 18:51.117
Spitting lead with my tiger
as backup.

18:51.119 --> 18:54.153
What? Ncis, bitches.
(chuckles)

18:55.122 --> 18:56.654
Ready.

18:56.656 --> 18:58.455
That was
a trick question.

18:58.457 --> 19:00.457
I was supposed to say
"world peace," right?

19:00.459 --> 19:01.591
Good talk.

19:09.033 --> 19:10.265
Clear.

19:10.267 --> 19:11.599
Clear!

19:13.436 --> 19:15.436
Wow.

19:15.438 --> 19:18.472
That's a lot of robots.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.908
Do you smell that?

19:21.910 --> 19:24.443
(sniffs)
that's gas.

19:24.445 --> 19:27.446
Kens, go, go, go, go, go!

19:27.448 --> 19:28.346
Deeks, come on!

19:28.348 --> 19:29.680
Go, go, go,

19:29.682 --> 19:31.214
Go, go, go, go!

19:31.216 --> 19:33.215
(panting)

19:36.019 --> 19:37.485
(groans, exhales)

19:37.487 --> 19:39.286
(line ringing)
eric:
Yeah, kens.

19:39.288 --> 19:41.288
Eric, we need the fire
department, bomb squad,

19:41.290 --> 19:43.957
And gas company out to lam's
house. Somebody beat us here.

19:43.959 --> 19:46.326
Copy.
They were hoping to burn
this place to the ground

19:46.328 --> 19:48.461
Before we found
anything.

19:48.463 --> 19:51.330
A bunch of those same toy robots
were at the store lam visited

19:51.332 --> 19:53.932
Before he was killed.
Well, maybe he's
a collector.

19:53.934 --> 19:55.600
Shop owner said
he didn't recognize him.

19:55.602 --> 19:57.401
How do you not recognize a guy
who's been to your store

19:57.403 --> 20:00.137
A dozen times?
Maybe he buys
'em in bulk.

20:00.139 --> 20:03.206
Maybe we need to take
a closer look at the people

20:03.208 --> 20:06.509
Who work at the shop.

20:23.126 --> 20:25.192
(rustling)

20:29.364 --> 20:31.497
(groans)

20:37.071 --> 20:38.470
Did you lose something?

20:38.472 --> 20:40.338
Oh, my god.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.405
You scared me.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.306
Sorry.
How did
you get

20:43.308 --> 20:44.740
In here? We're closed.

20:44.742 --> 20:46.441
You work here?

20:46.443 --> 20:48.609
Yes. Who are you?

20:48.611 --> 20:52.279
Special agent g. Callen, ncis.

20:52.281 --> 20:53.480
What were you

20:53.482 --> 20:55.014
Looking for?

20:55.016 --> 20:57.416
A shipping receipt order.

20:57.418 --> 21:00.051
A hotel in san francisco
ordered eight dozen chairs

21:00.053 --> 21:02.253
That were supposed
to be there yesterday.

21:02.254 --> 21:04.454
And if I can't find them,
my boss is going to fire me.
Uh-huh.

21:04.457 --> 21:06.490
You thought maybe you...

21:06.492 --> 21:08.358
Put 'em in the microwave?

21:09.327 --> 21:11.226
I'm in trouble, aren't I?

21:11.228 --> 21:13.561
Well, that depends
on what you did.

21:13.563 --> 21:16.463
(crying):
I was just trying to help, okay?

21:16.465 --> 21:18.364
I had never had
a boyfriend before,

21:18.366 --> 21:20.499
And he told me he
loved me, so I...

21:20.501 --> 21:21.566
Okay.

21:21.568 --> 21:24.335
Okay, just...
Take a breath.

21:24.337 --> 21:26.370
Why don't you tell me
what happened, all right?

21:26.705 --> 21:28.438
(woman yells)

21:29.374 --> 21:32.241
(both grunting)

21:35.212 --> 21:38.379
(grunting, yelling)

21:45.554 --> 21:47.387
(loud grunt)

21:47.389 --> 21:50.289
(woman groans, pants)

21:53.594 --> 21:55.293
(camera shutter clicking)

22:09.074 --> 22:11.373
It's a nice wig.

22:14.444 --> 22:16.677
Why'd you kill jason lam?

22:19.448 --> 22:23.282
Why don't you tell me where
you learned to fight like that?

22:24.251 --> 22:26.985
Nothing, huh?

22:26.986 --> 22:29.720
Okay. Well, we're running your
records and your facial rec.

22:29.723 --> 22:32.523
It should be just a matter
of time before we I.D. You.

22:32.525 --> 22:35.192
I don't think your
supreme leader is gonna be

22:35.194 --> 22:37.177
Very excited when we do.

22:37.178 --> 22:39.161
I think kim jong-un is
gonna be a little kim jong

22:39.164 --> 22:40.530
Un-happy.

22:40.532 --> 22:43.633
He might even be a
little kim jong pissed.

22:43.635 --> 22:46.369
You like that?

22:46.371 --> 22:47.803
Granger:
You sure you don't know her?

22:47.805 --> 22:49.704
I am not that lucky.

22:49.706 --> 22:51.572
I mean,
if she wasn't

22:51.574 --> 22:53.740
A killer spy.
(chuckles)

22:53.742 --> 22:56.308
<i> But</i> it might be worth it.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.478
I've been in prison.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.780
What now?

23:05.184 --> 23:06.716
You're free to go.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.718
Just don't leave l.A.
(scoffs)

23:08.720 --> 23:11.087
You're kidding, right?
I don't have enough money

23:11.089 --> 23:12.655
To get across town.
You should
have thought

23:12.657 --> 23:15.290
Of that before you
started ripping people off.

23:15.292 --> 23:17.825
Any chance I can get a ride?

23:17.827 --> 23:19.760
You want a ride?
I can't afford

23:19.762 --> 23:22.662
Bus fare-- I told my ex-wife
I'd be there by 5:00.

23:22.664 --> 23:25.131
Come on, man,
it's christmas.

23:25.133 --> 23:26.565
Give him a lift.
I got this.

23:26.567 --> 23:28.667
Okay.

23:28.669 --> 23:30.502
You heard the man.
Really?

23:30.504 --> 23:31.636
Ah, man, that's great!

23:31.638 --> 23:33.404
Hey, you don't by chance

23:33.406 --> 23:35.239
Have a clean shirt, do you?

23:35.241 --> 23:38.508
Maybe a tie?
Why don't we just cut you
a suit while you wait?

23:38.510 --> 23:40.443
Look, I'm sorry.

23:40.445 --> 23:42.378
I haven't seen my kid
in a while,

23:42.380 --> 23:44.179
And I don't want
to show up there

23:44.181 --> 23:46.414
Looking like...
You just got
out of prison?

23:46.416 --> 23:48.315
Yeah.

23:48.317 --> 23:50.684
We can hook
you up.

23:57.392 --> 23:59.658
(door closes)

23:59.660 --> 24:01.826
Eric (over phone):
Right. Okay, so, uh, what else?

24:01.828 --> 24:03.594
Yeah. Find out
who owns the business,

24:03.596 --> 24:05.362
Who owns the business.
Who owns the property,

24:05.364 --> 24:06.529
Property.
Who's paying utilities,
the phone records,

24:06.531 --> 24:08.330
The employees,
the whole monty.

24:08.332 --> 24:10.532
Did you say employees?
Yeah, that's what
I just said to you.

24:10.534 --> 24:11.733
No, I know, I heard it, but I...
Eric?

24:11.735 --> 24:13.618
Yeah? (giggles)
are you listening to me?

24:13.619 --> 24:15.502
What are you talking about?
Are you sure?
'cause you sound crazy.

24:15.505 --> 24:16.504
What is he saying?

24:16.506 --> 24:18.572
Okay. All right,
call... Me back.

24:18.574 --> 24:19.739
Eric:
Okay. Bye.
Bye.

24:19.741 --> 24:21.574
What just happened there?

24:21.576 --> 24:23.876
Pretty sure one of the wonder
twins got into the candy canes,

24:23.878 --> 24:25.377
And now he's on a sugar rush.

24:25.379 --> 24:27.545
(sighs):
Ah... Okay.

24:27.547 --> 24:29.213
All right...
(clears throat)

24:29.215 --> 24:30.547
What would you want
for christmas

24:30.549 --> 24:33.383
If you could
have anything?

24:33.385 --> 24:34.917
That's easy-- forgiveness.

24:34.919 --> 24:36.785
Forgiveness for what?

24:36.787 --> 24:38.453
For not telling you something

24:38.455 --> 24:41.155
I should've told you
a long time ago.

24:41.157 --> 24:43.457
And I fully recognize

24:43.459 --> 24:45.826
This is the most bizarre
of circumstances

24:45.828 --> 24:48.461
And the weirdest timing
to have this conversation.

24:48.463 --> 24:51.597
What conversation, exactly?

24:59.573 --> 25:03.575
The whole internal affairs
investigation.

25:03.577 --> 25:05.877
I... Was trying

25:05.879 --> 25:08.512
To protect you
and trying to protect ncis,

25:08.514 --> 25:11.214
Because...

25:11.216 --> 25:14.283
Because john quinn
didn't kill boyle.

25:14.285 --> 25:17.185
I did, and I did it
to protect tiffany.

25:24.694 --> 25:26.493
I know.

25:26.495 --> 25:29.662
What do you mean you know?
No, you don't.

25:29.664 --> 25:32.197
I didn't know,
but I figured it out.

25:32.199 --> 25:34.599
Well, why didn't you
say anything?

25:35.702 --> 25:38.668
I just figured you'd tell me
when you were ready to.

25:40.638 --> 25:42.938
(softly):
I'm sorry.

25:44.474 --> 25:46.540
It's okay.

25:49.978 --> 25:52.478
Just no more secrets.

25:52.480 --> 25:53.745
Okay?

25:53.747 --> 25:55.947
No more secrets.

25:58.484 --> 26:02.486
Do you have any idea
how much I love you right now?

26:03.455 --> 26:04.987
No.

26:04.989 --> 26:07.456
But I'm hoping

26:07.458 --> 26:10.525
That it will be reflected
in my christmas gift.

26:10.527 --> 26:13.361
I need to kiss you.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.463
You can't kiss me right
now-- we're on the job.

26:15.465 --> 26:17.932
Yeah, but it's christmas, and
these are special circumstances.
I understand that,

26:17.934 --> 26:20.501
But we have to keep our eyes
on the shop now.

26:20.503 --> 26:22.569
We don't even know what
we're looking for in the shop.

26:22.571 --> 26:24.637
Forget the shop.
I need to kiss you.

26:24.639 --> 26:25.771
(sighs)

26:25.773 --> 26:28.874
Fine. I'll do it.

26:28.876 --> 26:30.876
That... That's not a kiss.
That doesn't count as a kiss.

26:30.878 --> 26:33.612
That's, like, a fourth
of a kiss, it's, like,
a fraction of a kiss.

26:33.614 --> 26:35.947
Well, then you'll get the
other fraction at home.

26:35.949 --> 26:36.948
Oh, wow.

26:50.997 --> 26:53.397
You look good.

26:53.399 --> 26:54.531
Yeah?

26:55.534 --> 26:58.268
I should have brought a gift.

26:58.270 --> 27:00.570
I think they're gonna be
pleased just to see you.

27:00.572 --> 27:01.571
Hey.

27:01.573 --> 27:02.838
Good luck.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.572
Thanks.

27:08.010 --> 27:10.844
Oh, uh, what about the suit?

27:10.846 --> 27:12.612
Consider it a christmas gift.

27:12.614 --> 27:13.846
Really?

27:13.848 --> 27:14.947
Really.

27:14.949 --> 27:16.848
Happy holidays.

27:16.850 --> 27:18.749
Happy holidays.

27:25.657 --> 27:27.056
(starts engine)

27:28.926 --> 27:31.693
(door opens)

27:40.036 --> 27:42.036
So one's coffee,
one's tea.

27:42.038 --> 27:44.772
They both have
poison in them.

27:46.041 --> 27:49.776
And I'll take
whichever one you don't want.

27:54.515 --> 27:56.882
I hate the
holidays, too.

28:00.721 --> 28:01.853
Good.

28:03.423 --> 28:05.790
I also hate tea.

28:09.395 --> 28:12.662
You don't remember me, do you?

28:13.865 --> 28:17.032
No. I don't know who you are.

28:18.969 --> 28:21.736
I didn't recognize you at first.

28:21.738 --> 28:24.405
Strangely enough,

28:24.407 --> 28:26.974
The wig was the tip-off--
the first time I met your mom,

28:26.976 --> 28:29.443
She was using the same trick,
only she was trying

28:29.445 --> 28:31.645
To pass herself off
as an old lady.

28:31.647 --> 28:35.849
My mother works at a nail salon
in scottsdale.

28:35.851 --> 28:38.685
Your mother shot me in the ass
in kowloon.

28:38.687 --> 28:40.520
Okay, look,
I don't know

28:40.522 --> 28:43.389
What you're playing here,
but this is wrongful arrest,

28:43.391 --> 28:45.691
And I'm gonna sue
whatever mickey mouse
operation this is

28:45.693 --> 28:47.592
For everything that you've got.

28:47.594 --> 28:50.595
My name is jennifer kim,
and I'm a personal trainer,

28:50.597 --> 28:53.097
But I also know
what my rights are.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.965
I don't have to talk to you,

28:54.967 --> 28:56.766
And I have the right
to an attorney.

28:56.768 --> 28:58.634
Which I want right now.

29:00.070 --> 29:02.670
This is me and
your mom in macau

29:02.672 --> 29:05.639
Around '89.

29:05.641 --> 29:09.575
She shot me,
like, two weeks later.

29:10.711 --> 29:14.646
She probably taught
you english, right?

29:14.648 --> 29:16.781
Thought she
was doing you a favor

29:16.783 --> 29:19.784
Until they recruited you
when you were a little kid.

29:19.786 --> 29:22.720
One day to say
good-bye,

29:22.722 --> 29:25.389
Then it was off to the mountains
for spy school.

29:25.391 --> 29:28.558
They smuggled you
in to the u.S.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.960
Couple of years
later, and, uh...

29:30.962 --> 29:33.696
Been here ever since.

29:38.736 --> 29:42.704
I bet you haven't seen her
for a long time.

29:45.141 --> 29:47.007
Well...

29:48.677 --> 29:50.743
(sighs)

29:50.745 --> 29:53.579
I guess that makes two of us.

29:59.085 --> 30:02.786
If she really is a spy with the
dprk that we don't know about,

30:02.788 --> 30:04.120
We're not gonna get a match.

30:04.122 --> 30:06.689
Well, her I.D. Says
she's jennifer kim--

30:06.691 --> 30:08.757
Born in duluth,
minnesota, lives in l.A.

30:08.759 --> 30:10.992
And works as a
personal trainer.
Question:

30:10.994 --> 30:14.195
Has she ever worked in the
toy shop where lam was shopping?

30:14.197 --> 30:15.196
Let's see.

30:15.198 --> 30:16.664
No. Doesn't
look like it.

30:16.666 --> 30:18.132
Fa-la-la!

30:18.134 --> 30:19.199
What's up?
From 2006

30:19.201 --> 30:22.435
To 2008,
she worked for mh imports.

30:22.437 --> 30:23.669
That's mike
hobbs's company.

30:23.671 --> 30:25.871
Interesting.
And he said he didn't know her.

30:25.873 --> 30:27.873
He knows way more
than he's letting on.

30:27.875 --> 30:30.809
I think it's time
to call callen.

30:34.714 --> 30:36.547
(knocking)

30:37.516 --> 30:39.082
Hi. I dropped off
mike earlier.

30:39.084 --> 30:40.883
Can I speak with him
for a second?

30:40.885 --> 30:42.150
He took puddles out.

30:42.152 --> 30:43.518
I'm sorry?

30:43.520 --> 30:45.537
The dog.
He took him out

30:45.538 --> 30:47.555
For a walk.
I take it you're
mike's ex-wife?

30:47.557 --> 30:49.056
Gloria. Adam's now.

30:49.058 --> 30:51.858
Are you a friend of mike's?
Are you a con?

30:51.860 --> 30:53.559
Uh, not really, and no.

30:53.561 --> 30:55.761
I'm... I'm mike's
parole officer.

30:55.763 --> 30:57.028
I don't know what he's doing.

30:57.030 --> 30:59.497
He's been gone
for at least 45 minutes.

30:59.499 --> 31:02.566
Knowing mike, he's
probably stolen the dog.

31:04.703 --> 31:06.002
(camera shutter clicking)

31:13.711 --> 31:15.844
Eric, activate the tracker
in hobbs's suit,

31:15.846 --> 31:18.079
And get me a list
of any animal hospitals

31:18.081 --> 31:19.547
Or shelters in the area.

31:19.549 --> 31:21.115
Are we getting puppies
for christmas?

31:21.117 --> 31:22.883
Best christmas ever!

31:22.885 --> 31:24.851
No, we are not.
(gasps)

31:24.853 --> 31:26.485
Cross-check it with
cab companies and uber

31:26.487 --> 31:28.153
Who may have picked
someone up in this area.

31:28.155 --> 31:31.022
Got it.
Taxis, not puppies.

31:31.024 --> 31:32.156
Whoa, whoa, wait. Callen--

31:32.158 --> 31:34.091
It's hobbs.
It looks like he made

31:34.093 --> 31:35.959
Three calls from
his motel room. One to

31:35.961 --> 31:37.994
An escort service.
One to his ex-wife,

31:37.996 --> 31:40.663
And one to the toy shop kensi
and deeks are watching.

31:40.665 --> 31:43.565
The same shop that lam was
at before he was killed.

31:43.567 --> 31:45.667
Must have been their contact
point. That's how kim knew

31:45.669 --> 31:47.535
Where to find lam.
They must have called him in.

31:47.537 --> 31:49.236
All right, have
kensi and deeks to sit tight.

31:49.238 --> 31:50.804
Will do.
Yeah.

31:50.806 --> 31:52.938
(barking in distance)

31:55.609 --> 31:57.275
How can I help you?
Hi.

31:57.277 --> 31:59.210
I, uh...
(clears throat)

31:59.211 --> 32:01.144
...Found this dog wandering
in the street like he was lost.

32:01.147 --> 32:03.647
He doesn't have a collar
but I thought

32:03.649 --> 32:06.082
He might have
one of those chips in him.
Okay.

32:06.084 --> 32:08.117
Well, let's take a look.
How you doing, buddy?

32:08.119 --> 32:11.019
You got some I.D. To help us
get you home for christmas?

32:11.021 --> 32:12.286
(beep)

32:12.288 --> 32:14.288
Oh. This is your lucky day, boy.

32:14.290 --> 32:15.689
I just have to plug it

32:15.691 --> 32:19.292
In the database
to get the owner's info.

32:19.294 --> 32:20.760
Huh. That's weird.

32:20.762 --> 32:22.128
It's just a bunch of names.

32:22.130 --> 32:24.997
Uh... Let me see.

32:28.602 --> 32:30.234
Can I borrow a pen?

32:30.236 --> 32:32.302
Use mine.

32:40.144 --> 32:41.843
(dogs barking)

32:41.845 --> 32:43.144
(grunting)

32:45.681 --> 32:47.814
I'm not saying a word
till I talk to my lawyer!

32:52.219 --> 32:55.320
Hey. Hey. I'm pretty sure

32:55.322 --> 32:56.954
This is against
some laws

32:56.956 --> 32:58.188
Of the geneva convention.

32:58.190 --> 32:59.255
We're not in geneva.

32:59.257 --> 33:01.557
So how'd you
do it, huh?

33:01.559 --> 33:03.191
Did you counterfeit
documents, too?

33:03.193 --> 33:05.026
I didn't even know
they were spies.

33:05.028 --> 33:06.260
Sure you didn't.

33:06.262 --> 33:09.196
I didn't.
I was making plenty on purses.

33:09.198 --> 33:12.065
But my chinese supplier
said

33:12.067 --> 33:13.199
He needed help getting
some family members

33:13.201 --> 33:14.600
Back into the country.

33:14.602 --> 33:15.867
Jason lam.

33:15.869 --> 33:17.235
Yeah.

33:17.237 --> 33:18.169
Which he paid you for.

33:18.171 --> 33:19.570
Well, yeah.
I helped

33:19.572 --> 33:22.205
With the visas and
giving them jobs.

33:22.207 --> 33:24.974
I didn't know they were
north korean until I got busted.

33:24.976 --> 33:26.842
Then I got
to thinking.
You shouldn't do that.

33:26.844 --> 33:28.243
You're not good at that.

33:28.245 --> 33:30.345
Before I got locked up,
I made a list.
What'd you,

33:30.347 --> 33:32.580
Check it twice, you find out
who was naughty or nice?

33:32.582 --> 33:34.715
Which you hid on your kid's dog

33:34.717 --> 33:36.283
Hoping to cash in
when you got out

33:36.285 --> 33:38.585
By selling it to
the north koreans, am I right?

33:38.587 --> 33:39.786
Huh?

33:39.788 --> 33:41.120
It was a good
plan on paper.

33:41.122 --> 33:43.055
It was a terrible plan.

33:43.057 --> 33:45.624
Now, how did you know the
toy shop was the contact point?

33:45.626 --> 33:47.359
I followed them.

33:47.361 --> 33:49.194
Could have been a

33:49.196 --> 33:51.095
Pretty good spy myself.

33:51.097 --> 33:53.230
You know what,
you're lucky to be alive.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.232
If you hadn't gotten busted,
you probably wouldn't be

33:55.234 --> 33:57.734
Right now.
Look, I was just trying
to get a little money

33:57.736 --> 33:59.335
So I could get back on my feet.

34:01.172 --> 34:03.705
What happens now?

34:03.707 --> 34:06.240
Well, it'd be a shame
to go this far

34:06.242 --> 34:08.842
And not sell that list of yours.

34:14.316 --> 34:17.750
¶ we can frolic and play
in the snow on a sleigh ¶

34:17.752 --> 34:20.986
Ho, ho, ho!
¶ just you and me
on our snow day ¶

34:20.988 --> 34:24.322
¶ it's the best time of year,
it's the best time of day ¶

34:24.324 --> 34:27.958
¶ just you and me ¶

34:27.960 --> 34:31.027
¶ on our snow day ¶

34:36.400 --> 34:39.167
Okay, we have
four men approaching,

34:39.169 --> 34:41.169
One of them
is carrying a briefcase.

34:41.171 --> 34:43.004
Two just split off
in overwatch positions.

34:43.006 --> 34:44.271
Kensi:
I got it.

34:44.273 --> 34:48.041
Yes, I got you. Hi! Hi.

34:55.984 --> 34:57.283
Hobbs.

34:57.285 --> 34:59.285
In the flesh.

34:59.287 --> 35:00.786
You have something for me?

35:00.788 --> 35:02.287
That depends.

35:02.289 --> 35:04.355
Do you have
something for me?

35:17.970 --> 35:19.402
Merry christmas.

35:21.706 --> 35:23.439
If I find out
there's another copy of this...

35:23.441 --> 35:25.674
You won't.

35:32.348 --> 35:34.181
Federal agent. On the ground.

35:35.984 --> 35:37.083
(grunting)

35:43.791 --> 35:45.423
(yells)
oh!

35:49.128 --> 35:50.360
(grunts)

35:50.362 --> 35:52.995
I bet you did not
see that coming, did you?

35:55.966 --> 35:57.231
Cuff him.

35:57.233 --> 35:59.933
Merry christmas.
You got him?

35:59.935 --> 36:01.234
Ho, ho, ho.

36:01.236 --> 36:04.437
Oh. Boys and girls, somebody's

36:04.439 --> 36:06.238
Been very naughty.
Cuffs.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.807
That's why
you got to be good, huh?

36:08.809 --> 36:10.475
Who's been nice this year?
I want to see

36:10.477 --> 36:12.043
A show of hands.
You got to brush

36:12.045 --> 36:13.878
Your teeth
and do your homework.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.412
Speaking of which,
did you brush your teeth?

36:15.414 --> 36:17.247
That smells a lot like salmon.
That's disgusting.

36:17.249 --> 36:19.749
Ho, ho, ho!
Be good, kids.

36:19.751 --> 36:22.218
Nice timing.

36:22.220 --> 36:24.453
Yeah. I couldn't let you
guys have all the fun.

36:24.455 --> 36:25.954
Where's aiden?

36:25.956 --> 36:27.288
I told him to wait in the car.
(whoops)

36:27.290 --> 36:30.424
That was badass.

36:30.426 --> 36:32.459
I told you to wait in the car.
Oh, and miss this?

36:32.461 --> 36:33.927
That was really cool.

36:33.929 --> 36:35.161
What's up, uncle g?

36:35.163 --> 36:36.862
Well, you know,
catching bad guys,

36:36.864 --> 36:38.463
Saving christmas,
same old thing.

36:38.465 --> 36:41.299
Yeah, yeah. I love how you guys
work together like that.

36:41.301 --> 36:44.135
Well, don't love it too much.
Oh, come on, I'd be
really good at this.

36:44.137 --> 36:46.103
He has the pedigree.
Yeah.

36:46.105 --> 36:47.471
Don't listen to him.
You know what?

36:47.473 --> 36:48.939
We'll talk over christmas.

36:48.941 --> 36:52.275
No, not about this,
you won't.

36:55.146 --> 36:57.012
Why don't we just cook?
Okay, I don't cook,

36:57.014 --> 36:58.480
And unless you're planning
on making frittatas,

36:58.482 --> 37:00.332
Neither do you.

37:00.333 --> 37:02.183
Wow, christmas frittatas, huh?
Boom, new tradition.

37:02.185 --> 37:03.484
You know what, forget it.

37:03.486 --> 37:04.885
Why don't you guys
just come to my place?

37:04.887 --> 37:06.386
There's plenty
of room, michelle

37:06.388 --> 37:07.887
Will love it.
Um, I
wouldn't mind,

37:07.889 --> 37:09.355
But we have
our moms with us.

37:09.357 --> 37:10.389
No, that's perfect.

37:10.391 --> 37:11.523
They won't
be able to cook

37:11.525 --> 37:12.824
And they can talk
to my mother-in-law

37:12.826 --> 37:14.091
So I don't have to.

37:14.093 --> 37:16.927
Everybody wins.
It's the best
idea ever.

37:16.929 --> 37:18.295
So does that mean
you want me to bring

37:18.297 --> 37:19.462
My santa claus outfit
for kamran?

37:19.464 --> 37:21.263
No.

37:21.265 --> 37:22.430
You can still bring it, though.

37:22.432 --> 37:24.331
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

37:24.333 --> 37:26.399
Down the chimney.
Kensi:
Okay. (chuckles)

37:28.202 --> 37:29.401
Ooh.

37:29.403 --> 37:31.336
Hetty, I d... I didn't...
Oh, no,

37:31.338 --> 37:33.237
No, no, no.
This is not for you.

37:33.239 --> 37:35.505
I-I mean, not-not per se.

37:35.507 --> 37:38.074
It's, uh, your backup plan.

37:38.076 --> 37:40.076
They're vintage earrings.

37:40.078 --> 37:42.278
She should like them.
Thank you, and...

37:42.280 --> 37:44.513
Merry christmas, hetty.

37:44.515 --> 37:47.048
Merry christmas,
mr. Callen.

37:58.394 --> 37:59.793
(door closes in distance)

37:59.795 --> 38:01.060
Clear.

38:03.397 --> 38:05.296
(whispers): Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:06.265 --> 38:08.565
Come on.

38:09.801 --> 38:11.066
Hey.

38:14.037 --> 38:16.037
Get over here.

38:16.039 --> 38:18.105
Okay.

38:24.312 --> 38:26.011
You guys look great.

38:26.013 --> 38:28.213
Oh.
Really?

38:28.215 --> 38:29.547
Yeah.

38:29.549 --> 38:32.383
Thank you, sir.

38:32.385 --> 38:34.952
Have fun.

38:34.954 --> 38:37.421
(short chuckle)
okay.

38:37.423 --> 38:39.923
What he did.

38:39.925 --> 38:41.424
Happy holidays.
Let's go. Bye-bye!

38:41.426 --> 38:43.426
(both laughing)

38:43.428 --> 38:45.394
(door closes)

38:45.396 --> 38:49.364
¶ I'll be home ¶

38:52.235 --> 38:53.867
(sighs)

38:53.869 --> 38:55.368
I'm sorry I'm late.

38:55.370 --> 38:57.436
Took longer
than I expected, I...

38:57.438 --> 39:00.038
Where did all this come from?

39:00.040 --> 39:01.539
I brought it from home.

39:01.541 --> 39:03.440
I just thought we should
have a nice dinner.

39:03.442 --> 39:06.476
Uh, and what is that?

39:06.478 --> 39:09.879
It's-it's just something little.
Now, I know we agreed,

39:09.881 --> 39:11.981
But I... (gasps)
uh...

39:11.983 --> 39:14.249
Oh.

39:18.622 --> 39:19.921
I was so worried about you.

39:19.923 --> 39:21.555
Oh, come on, I told you--

39:21.557 --> 39:23.590
You don't have
to worry about me.

39:23.592 --> 39:25.592
But I will

39:25.594 --> 39:28.361
As long as you do this.

39:29.964 --> 39:31.964
I know.

39:31.966 --> 39:35.367
My new year's resolution
is gonna be

39:35.369 --> 39:38.469
No dating people who might not
come home at night.

39:42.174 --> 39:44.407
So...

39:44.409 --> 39:47.076
We have till new year's?

39:47.078 --> 39:48.577
