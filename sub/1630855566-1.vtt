02:01.469 --> 02:03.210
<i>On the day
after the first snow fell,</i>

02:03.340 --> 02:06.691
<i>I parked my car in the lot
and carried my things inside.</i>

02:10.042 --> 02:12.132
<i>It felt like
the first day of school.</i>

02:13.176 --> 02:16.701
<i>I was anxious, sure,
but also full of hope.</i>

02:19.835 --> 02:23.317
<i>I could view the world
as something ominous, looming,</i>

02:23.447 --> 02:26.015
<i>or I could choose
to see the light.</i>

02:30.193 --> 02:31.977
<i>I chose to see the light.</i>

02:57.568 --> 02:59.440
<i>The woman in reception smiled.</i>

03:00.832 --> 03:02.443
<i>There was something about her.</i>

03:04.923 --> 03:07.361
<i>I knew then that I'd come
to the right place.</i>

03:29.905 --> 03:31.298
Elevator's to the right.

03:33.517 --> 03:37.478
<i>I had gotten used
to being one of the leaders
in my last job.</i>

03:37.608 --> 03:40.002
<i>Not a manager
or even a team leader,</i>

03:40.132 --> 03:43.832
<i>but someone who could sometimes
show other people what to do.</i>

03:48.750 --> 03:52.232
<i>I was determined to build up
the same position at
my new place of work</i>

03:52.362 --> 03:53.624
<i>as soon as I could.</i>

03:57.237 --> 04:01.284
<i>Finally, I would be
able to blossom
to my full potential...</i>

04:03.417 --> 04:06.681
<i>become the person
I've always wanted to be.</i>

04:06.811 --> 04:08.726
<i>A person to be reckoned with.</i>

04:20.434 --> 04:22.610
<i>I knew I had to make
a platform for myself</i>

04:22.740 --> 04:26.309
<i>and show the boss
what I was capable of
from day one.</i>

04:31.749 --> 04:34.143
<i>I shared my desk with Rakesh,</i>

04:34.274 --> 04:37.146
<i>who helped me
with various practical details.</i>

04:42.369 --> 04:44.632
That's how
the coffee machine works.

04:44.762 --> 04:46.547
<i>I guess it was
a welcome break from work,</i>

04:46.677 --> 04:48.810
<i>because he was always
coming up with new things</i>

04:48.940 --> 04:50.159
<i>I ought to know about.</i>

04:50.768 --> 04:51.726
Rubber bands.

04:54.424 --> 04:55.730
In here are paper clips.

04:57.732 --> 04:59.211
And this is where
the pencils go.

05:01.649 --> 05:02.954
This is how the blinds work.

05:18.796 --> 05:21.756
<i>I arrived 15 minutes
early every morning,</i>

05:21.886 --> 05:24.802
<i>then followed my own timetable
for the rest of the day.</i>

05:24.933 --> 05:26.848
<i>Fifty-five minutes
of concentrated work,</i>

05:26.978 --> 05:28.632
<i>followed by
a five-minute break.</i>

05:32.332 --> 05:34.334
<i>I was confident
I'd adapt quickly</i>

05:34.464 --> 05:36.336
<i>and soon be on the way
to success.</i>

05:41.210 --> 05:43.255
<i>Slowly but surely,
I built up a profile</i>

05:43.386 --> 05:44.735
<i>of my closest neighbors,</i>

05:44.866 --> 05:47.608
<i>their character,
and place in the hierarchy.</i>

05:49.349 --> 05:51.568
<i>Shannon had been
at the company
longer than Rakesh,</i>

05:51.699 --> 05:54.354
- <i>though not as long as Carol.</i>

05:55.485 --> 05:57.139
<i>Carol seemed knowledgeable,</i>

05:57.269 --> 06:00.403
<i>but also the sort of person
who thought she knew everything</i>

06:00.534 --> 06:01.839
<i>and liked being right.</i>

06:03.319 --> 06:04.973
Shannon, look,

06:05.103 --> 06:08.542
you do see what it says
right here, don't you?

06:11.501 --> 06:14.025
<i>Shannon was
the kind of person
who laughs at everything,</i>

06:14.156 --> 06:16.158
<i>even when whatever's
just been said...</i>

06:16.288 --> 06:19.030
- Right. Right, right.
- <i>...isn't funny at all.</i>

06:19.161 --> 06:21.206
Because it says that.
I get it.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.949
Can you explain it
to me, though?

06:28.866 --> 06:33.305
<i>Everyone turned to Carol
when they didn't dare
approach the boss.</i>

06:37.440 --> 06:39.616
<i>Opposite Carol sat Mitchell.</i>

06:39.747 --> 06:41.139
- Open the door.
- <i>He'd been there longer</i>

06:41.270 --> 06:43.228
- <i>than the rest combined...</i>
- Carefully, yes.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.274
- <i>...but how he had managed
that feat...</i>
- Carefully open the door,

06:45.405 --> 06:47.755
- and to your right
you will find...
- <i>...wasn't immediately clear.</i>

06:49.234 --> 06:50.932
Yes, the umbrella.

06:51.846 --> 06:55.327
<i>Carol had a framed
child's drawing
near her computer.</i>

06:55.458 --> 06:57.939
<i>It showed a sun
sinking into the sea,</i>

06:58.069 --> 06:59.854
<i>but the drawing was wrong.</i>

06:59.984 --> 07:02.422
<i>On the horizon,
there were land masses</i>

07:02.552 --> 07:05.381
<i>sticking up on both sides
of the sun,</i>

07:05.512 --> 07:07.992
<i>which, of course,
is impossible.</i>

07:08.123 --> 07:11.866
<i>I wondered if she was aware
of its flagrant inaccuracy.</i>

07:11.996 --> 07:12.997
Can I help you?

07:13.781 --> 07:16.871
<i>Maybe she was blinded
by her emotional involvement.</i>

07:19.482 --> 07:20.962
<i>No matter what
the circumstances,</i>

07:21.092 --> 07:23.486
<i>the child deserved to be
made aware of their mistake,</i>

07:23.617 --> 07:26.054
<i>so that the error
could be avoided next time.</i>

07:39.371 --> 07:41.330
You, uh, want a cup of coffee?

07:44.028 --> 07:45.421
Okay.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.031
<i>Mitchell's lengthy tenure</i>

07:47.162 --> 07:49.991
<i>had, unfortunately,
not made him secure.</i>

07:50.121 --> 07:52.950
<i>He seemed constantly
in mortal fear.</i>

07:54.996 --> 07:56.519
Did you hear
about the layoffs?

08:05.789 --> 08:08.357
<i>I stuck to my schedule
and did not allow myself</i>

08:08.488 --> 08:10.446
<i>to be disturbed
in the middle of a period</i>

08:10.577 --> 08:13.101
<i>with small talk
or coffee breaks.</i>

08:19.150 --> 08:22.327
<i>Sometimes I felt like taking
a leak after five minutes</i>

08:22.458 --> 08:25.766
<i>but always made sure
I sat out the whole period.</i>

08:25.896 --> 08:27.550
<i>It was character-building,</i>

08:27.681 --> 08:30.248
<i>and, obviously, the relief
of finally easing the pressure</i>

08:30.379 --> 08:31.598
<i>was that much greater.</i>

08:36.080 --> 08:41.085
<i>I was heading that way
when I first discovered
the room.</i>

08:57.667 --> 08:59.669
<i>A musty smell hit my nose,</i>

09:00.583 --> 09:02.846
<i>but I don't remember
thinking much about it.</i>

09:08.678 --> 09:09.549
<i>Oh...</i>

09:11.551 --> 09:12.552
<i>a room.</i>

09:54.506 --> 09:56.813
<i>By the end of the day,
I had almost forgotten</i>

09:56.944 --> 10:00.164
<i>ever having looked
through the door
leading to that extra space.</i>

10:20.097 --> 10:24.232
<i>A few days later,
I found myself looking
for copy paper.</i>

10:25.189 --> 10:28.323
<i>Despite all the exhortations
to ask about things,</i>

10:28.453 --> 10:31.892
<i>I was unwilling
to expose myself
to humiliation and derision</i>

10:32.022 --> 10:35.460
<i>by displaying gaps
in my knowledge of the setup.</i>

10:42.032 --> 10:45.427
<i>The last place I'd worked,
there was a strictly
enforced policy</i>

10:45.557 --> 10:47.821
<i>regarding the use
of office supplies.</i>

10:49.170 --> 10:52.303
<i>It occurred to me
that hiding the paper
in an unlikely place</i>

10:52.434 --> 10:54.741
<i>might be a strategy
to avoid waste.</i>

11:11.322 --> 11:13.542
<i>At first, I couldn't
find the light.</i>

11:14.630 --> 11:18.416
<i>I felt along the walls
on either side of the door,
then gave up.</i>

11:23.204 --> 11:25.293
<i>What an odd place
to put a light switch.</i>

11:42.005 --> 11:46.140
<i>I was quickly able to ascertain
that there was no paper there,</i>

11:46.270 --> 11:48.272
<i>but, even so, I got
an immediate sense</i>

11:48.403 --> 11:51.058
<i>that there was something
special about this place.</i>

11:56.237 --> 11:57.238
<i>I went out,</i>

11:59.153 --> 12:00.284
<i>closed the door...</i>

12:03.070 --> 12:04.593
<i>and switched off the light.</i>

12:07.639 --> 12:08.945
<i>I opened the door again,</i>

12:09.990 --> 12:13.733
<i>just to make sure the light
wasn't still on in there.</i>

12:23.655 --> 12:26.354
You know, everyone else
has a little wall,

12:27.268 --> 12:29.531
or divider, between the desks...

12:32.186 --> 12:33.230
and we don't.

12:35.406 --> 12:38.061
I think I asked for one
a while back, but cutbacks.

12:40.107 --> 12:41.108
Doesn't matter.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.284
We got nothing to hide.

12:50.682 --> 12:52.293
We try to think about the floor.

13:05.523 --> 13:06.786
Of course.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.179
- Naturally.
- Hm.

13:26.718 --> 13:30.897
<i>I was annoyed
I hadn't thought
about the shoe covers myself.</i>

13:31.027 --> 13:33.725
<i>Obviously, I would have,
if I'd had time.</i>

13:34.988 --> 13:40.167
<i>Andrew had managed to make me
feel both stupid and insecure,</i>

13:40.297 --> 13:43.648
<i>when, in actuality, I was one
of the smartest there.</i>

13:46.564 --> 13:50.307
<i>Don't people usually try
to smooth over that sort
of remark with a joke</i>

13:50.438 --> 13:51.700
<i>or a little smile?</i>

13:54.311 --> 13:58.228
<i>Besides, it was just rude
to walk off like that.</i>

14:10.762 --> 14:14.244
<i>I reasoned that this
55-minute period
was already ruined.</i>

14:15.767 --> 14:17.378
<i>I would just have to sit it out</i>

14:17.508 --> 14:19.293
<i>and start again
with the next one.</i>

14:33.437 --> 14:36.310
<i>It would be a simple task
to unscrew the broken one</i>

14:36.440 --> 14:38.138
<i>and replace it with a new one.</i>

14:46.015 --> 14:48.452
<i>I couldn't believe
no one had done anything</i>

14:48.583 --> 14:50.715
<i>about such a simple problem.</i>

15:06.514 --> 15:08.472
<i>When combined
with his long sideburns</i>

15:08.603 --> 15:10.822
<i>and the rings under his eyes,</i>

15:10.953 --> 15:14.826
<i>Rakesh's jacket
made an unusually
scruffy impression.</i>

15:17.307 --> 15:19.962
<i>To be honest, his jacket
had been bothering me</i>

15:20.093 --> 15:21.964
<i>since first thing that morning,</i>

15:22.095 --> 15:25.185
<i>even before that nonsense
with the shoe covers.</i>

15:30.494 --> 15:33.628
<i>I seriously disliked
that jacket.</i>

15:37.066 --> 15:39.112
<i>I had to do something
to clear my mind.</i>

15:40.896 --> 15:43.681
<i>That's when I went
into the room
for the third time.</i>

15:55.171 --> 15:57.957
<i>My suit fit better
than I thought it did,</i>

15:58.087 --> 15:59.784
<i>and there was something
about the way it hung</i>

15:59.915 --> 16:02.700
<i>that made my body look virile.</i>

16:02.831 --> 16:05.138
<i>I looked incredibly relaxed,</i>

16:05.965 --> 16:08.576
<i>simultaneously confident
and aware.</i>

16:10.012 --> 16:12.406
<i>I had never thought of myself
as attractive,</i>

16:12.536 --> 16:16.279
<i>but I realized it was time
to start doing so...</i>

16:17.628 --> 16:20.544
<i>because the best thing
was the look in the eyes.</i>

16:21.502 --> 16:22.982
<i>This was a new asset--</i>

16:24.070 --> 16:26.594
<i>a pair of eyes that
could demand anything</i>

16:27.812 --> 16:28.900
<i>and get it.</i>

16:45.526 --> 16:47.049
<i>Rakesh carried out his duties</i>

16:47.180 --> 16:48.833
<i>with the same
devil-may-care attitude</i>

16:48.964 --> 16:50.183
<i>as everyone else.</i>

16:50.313 --> 16:52.185
<i>He used the phone
whenever he liked,</i>

16:52.315 --> 16:54.970
<i>took breaks whenever
he felt like it.</i>

16:55.101 --> 16:58.452
<i>He would spend eons
gazing off into the distance</i>

16:58.582 --> 17:01.455
<i>without it apparently having
anything to do with work.</i>

17:02.804 --> 17:05.546
<i>Now and then, he would even
try to talk to me.</i>

17:07.939 --> 17:10.203
- What's happening?
- <i>I would rebuff him,</i>

17:10.333 --> 17:12.205
<i>gently but firmly,</i>

17:12.335 --> 17:14.598
<i>usually with a simple
gesture of the hand.</i>

17:15.904 --> 17:17.036
<i>It worked.</i>

17:21.127 --> 17:24.652
<i>Rakesh had an irritating habit
of shoving his papers
across his desk</i>

17:24.782 --> 17:27.133
<i>every time he started
something new,</i>

17:27.263 --> 17:29.135
<i>which meant that eventually,</i>

17:29.265 --> 17:31.354
<i>maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow,</i>

17:31.485 --> 17:33.139
<i>but someday soon,</i>

17:33.269 --> 17:35.793
<i>Rakesh's desktop
would overflow.</i>

17:56.988 --> 17:58.077
Rakesh.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.475
- Yeah?
- Do you have a minute?

18:06.476 --> 18:09.044
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Take a look around you.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.139
Uh...

18:19.054 --> 18:20.621
What do you see?

18:20.751 --> 18:22.492
Uh...

18:24.799 --> 18:28.281
- Yeah, I don't know.
- We should deal
with this right away.

18:28.411 --> 18:30.935
- W-with what?
- Before this gets out of hand,

18:31.066 --> 18:34.156
I want you to hear me out.
I think you'll see
what I'm saying.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.290
Let's take a walk.

18:41.642 --> 18:42.556
Okay.

18:47.517 --> 18:49.563
- Yeah. All right.
- Yeah. Let's take a walk.

18:49.693 --> 18:52.305
<i>It would be best
to deal with this in private.</i>

18:52.435 --> 18:54.829
There's something
I've noticed.

18:56.396 --> 18:57.266
What?

18:59.660 --> 19:02.706
You don't put
your old files back

19:02.837 --> 19:04.882
whenever you take out new files.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.934
- Wait, what did you say?
- Well, what I'm saying is

19:13.064 --> 19:14.718
that you're letting
all of your papers

19:14.849 --> 19:16.155
spread out
all over your desk.

19:16.285 --> 19:17.808
Now, soon, they're
gonna be on my side,

19:17.939 --> 19:20.507
and then they'll be
encroaching in my space.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.337
Now, I am, as I'm sure
you can understand,

19:24.467 --> 19:31.300
very eager to utilize
the full space of my desk.

19:31.431 --> 19:32.345
Yeah.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.565
I mean, it's inconvenient enough
that we have to work

19:35.696 --> 19:38.525
without even a modicum
of privacy.

19:38.655 --> 19:41.136
I mean, how hard is it
to put up a simple divider?

19:42.311 --> 19:43.747
- Right.

19:43.878 --> 19:46.097
But don't worry about that.
That's not your problem.

19:46.228 --> 19:49.710
All I'm asking is that
you adopt some new habits

19:50.667 --> 19:52.713
that don't run the risk
of disturbing my work.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.149
Do you understand?

19:58.588 --> 19:59.633
Great.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.463
Great. Great.

20:03.593 --> 20:06.814
Well, then, I suggest
we get back to our duties.

20:06.944 --> 20:08.381
If it all goes smoothly,

20:10.296 --> 20:12.254
we needn't ever
mention this again.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.279
<i>Rakesh sat and looked
at me for a long while</i>

20:37.410 --> 20:39.716
<i>after we had returned
to our places,</i>

20:39.847 --> 20:42.197
<i>without doing anything
about his papers.</i>

20:43.851 --> 20:47.246
<i>I let him. Presumably,
he wasn't used
to being corrected</i>

20:47.376 --> 20:50.074
<i>in such a clear
and effective way.</i>

20:50.205 --> 20:52.947
Don't think of it
as a reprimand...

20:55.819 --> 20:57.125
more as an observation.

22:12.069 --> 22:14.507
<i>Inside the room,
there was a calm.</i>

22:15.595 --> 22:20.164
<i>A concentration that felt like
early mornings at school.</i>

22:22.079 --> 22:26.780
<i>It contained the same
relaxed feeling
and limited freedom.</i>

22:29.217 --> 22:31.741
<i>The whole room
breathed tradition.</i>

22:35.615 --> 22:38.269
<i>There was an air
of old-fashioned
quality to it.</i>

22:39.532 --> 22:42.796
<i>Each line seemed perfectly
connected to the next.</i>

22:43.666 --> 22:46.277
<i>Everything messy
and unsettling vanished.</i>

22:47.366 --> 22:49.585
<i>Precision returned.</i>

22:51.457 --> 22:53.328
<i>Is this what monks feel like</i>

22:53.459 --> 22:56.244
<i>as they walk the corridors
of their monasteries?</i>

23:03.643 --> 23:06.994
<i>Rakesh hadn't yet found
a better solution
for his papers,</i>

23:07.124 --> 23:09.083
<i>but I felt fine about it.</i>

23:09.213 --> 23:12.260
<i>He probably didn't want
to change his behavior
just like that</i>

23:12.391 --> 23:14.915
- <i>after being ordered to.</i>

23:15.045 --> 23:17.047
<i>I couldn't deny him
a degree of pride.</i>

23:17.178 --> 23:19.833
<i>If it turned out that
he was consciously
being obstructive,</i>

23:19.963 --> 23:22.923
<i>and if things hadn't improved
within a week,</i>

23:23.053 --> 23:24.968
<i>I would have to raise
the matter again.</i>

23:38.982 --> 23:40.157
Can I ask you something?

23:44.858 --> 23:45.946
Yes, go ahead.

23:56.652 --> 23:57.653
What are you doing?

23:59.176 --> 24:00.526
What do you mean?

24:00.656 --> 24:02.615
What are you doing
when you stand like that?

24:06.488 --> 24:08.055
What are you talking about?

24:10.971 --> 24:12.146
All right, man.
We can talk about it--

24:12.276 --> 24:13.756
No, please. What-- what...

24:15.584 --> 24:16.629
What do I do?

24:18.457 --> 24:22.330
You stand out there,
completely still.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.462
Do I?

24:24.375 --> 24:27.161
Yeah. It's like
you're just not there.

24:29.424 --> 24:31.295
Do I say anything?

24:32.645 --> 24:33.515
No.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.477
I mean, you're, like
completely gone.

24:38.607 --> 24:40.783
Like, completely
out of reach.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.350
You didn't move an inch.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.525
It was like
you couldn't hear me,

24:43.656 --> 24:44.744
like you were somewhere else.

24:44.874 --> 24:45.788
And...

24:46.746 --> 24:48.051
when do I do this?

24:48.182 --> 24:49.662
This morning.

24:52.926 --> 24:54.928
And the other day, you made me
come out there with you,

24:55.058 --> 24:58.018
and then you just
stood there like that.

25:01.935 --> 25:04.459
How long do I stand there
like that?

25:04.590 --> 25:09.072
I don't know, it varies.
Like, last time it was,
like, five minutes.

25:09.203 --> 25:12.162
Anybody else see me like that?

25:15.514 --> 25:16.602
Everyone.

25:29.136 --> 25:30.441
Mitchell.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.444
I need you to be honest
with me now.

25:34.271 --> 25:35.359
Think you can do that?

25:36.926 --> 25:40.539
- Uh... okay.
- I'm being very serious.

25:41.452 --> 25:45.239
Now, this might sound strange,
but I need you
to answer me truthfully.

25:46.936 --> 25:47.894
What?

25:48.024 --> 25:49.373
What is this room for?

25:52.812 --> 25:53.987
What room?

25:54.117 --> 25:56.076
- This room right here.

25:56.206 --> 25:57.991
Oh, well...

25:59.732 --> 26:01.560
there's the elevator
and there's the john.

26:01.690 --> 26:05.041
No, I'm talking
about this room.

26:05.999 --> 26:06.913
Uh...

26:12.396 --> 26:13.572
That's a wall.

26:14.616 --> 26:16.052
Is that all you have to say?

26:16.183 --> 26:19.229
Why are you so interested
in this wall?

26:20.143 --> 26:21.710
Don't drag me into this.

26:24.495 --> 26:28.282
<i>I realized
in that moment that Mitchell
was only a poor subordinate.</i>

26:28.412 --> 26:29.718
<i>He didn't want trouble.</i>

26:30.545 --> 26:33.983
<i>No. Whoever was responsible
for this deception</i>

26:34.114 --> 26:36.203
<i>was on a different level
of the hierarchy.</i>

26:37.683 --> 26:39.206
<i>The higher level.</i>

26:39.336 --> 26:40.903
Do you have any idea
what that's about?

26:41.034 --> 26:44.472
- I think it's very strange.
- He doesn't make any sense.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.430
I saw him do it
last Thursday.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.654
<i>I lost patience
and decided to gather
the staff together.</i>

26:54.874 --> 26:57.790
<i>I had the whole division
with me, except Andrew,</i>

26:57.920 --> 26:59.835
<i>who was stuck
in some meeting all day.</i>

26:59.966 --> 27:02.621
Well, I'd like to thank you all
for joining me in here today.

27:07.756 --> 27:11.847
So now I've seen through
your little joke.

27:11.978 --> 27:15.982
I don't know who the brains
behind it is, but, uh...

27:19.638 --> 27:22.075
I've figured out enough

27:22.815 --> 27:24.686
to let you know that out there

27:25.513 --> 27:28.821
you can pretend all you want
that there is no room,

27:30.257 --> 27:32.172
but in here, you can't pretend.

27:33.608 --> 27:34.914
There is a room.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.961
This is it. We're in it.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.794
So it's pointless to continue
this little game.

27:47.491 --> 27:50.146
And I expect,
now that we've had this chat,

27:51.321 --> 27:53.628
that all the bullying can stop

27:55.108 --> 27:56.849
and we can all get back
to business.

28:00.896 --> 28:01.854
All right?

28:06.162 --> 28:07.076
Great.

28:22.744 --> 28:26.356
<i>The next thing I knew,
the whole division
was called to Andrew's office.</i>

28:26.487 --> 28:27.967
<i>It was quite a squeeze.</i>

28:28.837 --> 28:31.840
- Come in.
- <i>Rakesh was wearing
a darker jacket,</i>

28:31.971 --> 28:33.624
<i>and I was much happier with it.</i>

28:33.755 --> 28:35.714
<i>It had a decent, classic cut.</i>

28:35.844 --> 28:38.151
<i>It made him fit in better
with the rest of us.</i>

28:40.153 --> 28:42.546
You know, it's not every day
that we have a...

28:42.677 --> 28:46.768
a division-wide meeting
on such short notice, but, um...

28:49.510 --> 28:51.512
Carol here has something
she'd like to discuss.

28:52.165 --> 28:54.776
Not just me. I think I can speak
for the whole division.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.607
We all think this is
getting to be too much.

29:00.782 --> 29:03.219
- What is?
- No, let Carol finish.

29:03.350 --> 29:06.570
<i>Obviously, I was going
to let her finish,
but all of a sudden,</i>

29:06.701 --> 29:09.530
<i>it was as if his supposition
that I had interrupted her...</i>

29:09.660 --> 29:11.010
-  Thank you.
- <i>...were true.</i>

29:11.140 --> 29:13.926
The truth is, we're all
getting worried about you.

29:15.536 --> 29:17.668
Why would you be
getting worried?

29:20.628 --> 29:22.325
It's the standing.

29:22.456 --> 29:25.328
Didn't I tell you
it was pointless
to try and conduct

29:25.459 --> 29:27.940
psychological warfare
against me?

29:31.204 --> 29:32.466
You can't bully me.

29:33.510 --> 29:35.121
What are you talking
about, Orson?

29:36.209 --> 29:38.428
I have a feeling that
this has its origins in the fact

29:38.559 --> 29:41.692
that some of you
may have noticed that I have,
on two or three occasions,

29:41.823 --> 29:45.958
taken myself aside
to garner my strength alone,

29:46.088 --> 29:50.005
having a short rest
in that little room
next to the elevator.

29:51.224 --> 29:55.228
I can understand
that to some of you,
this may seem annoying.

29:55.358 --> 29:56.969
Obviously, we all
have work to do,

29:57.099 --> 29:59.014
and we can't just take breaks
whenever we feel like it.

30:03.714 --> 30:07.544
But I want to assure you
that I will always take care

30:07.675 --> 30:10.939
to make up any concomitant
loss of efficiency...

30:13.115 --> 30:14.464
Hmm.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.423
And if any of you have
any secrets hidden in there

30:16.553 --> 30:18.773
that for whatever reason
you don't want me to see,

30:18.904 --> 30:20.949
you're welcome
to tell me right here.

30:22.429 --> 30:23.560
Anyone?

30:26.128 --> 30:27.347
Otherwise, you may go.

30:29.566 --> 30:31.394
Orson and I will handle this.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.362
- What the hell was that?
- Weird, is what it was.

30:48.368 --> 30:49.891
Are you not feeling well, Orson?

30:54.591 --> 30:58.247
You appreciate you simply
can't behave like this?

31:01.076 --> 31:02.599
It's unacceptable.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.036
Unacceptable.
Do you understand me?

31:04.166 --> 31:07.561
You simply can't dismiss people
from my office.

31:13.436 --> 31:15.569
This room...

31:18.180 --> 31:19.268
in the hall?

31:21.792 --> 31:26.232
Past the elevators,
across the hall
and right next to the bathrooms.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.889
What sort of room is it?

31:34.153 --> 31:37.547
As far as I can tell,
it isn't being used,
or hasn't been in a long time.

31:37.678 --> 31:41.247
I haven't taken anything
or made a mess,
or anything like that.

31:41.377 --> 31:43.902
If there's anything
shady going on,
I don't know about it.

31:47.035 --> 31:48.994
I just...

31:49.124 --> 31:51.561
go in there a few times,
and that's it.

31:52.693 --> 31:54.086
And what do you do there?

31:54.216 --> 31:55.565
- In the room?
- Mm-hmm.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.091
Spend time in there.

31:59.221 --> 32:01.571
But what exactly do you do?

32:03.660 --> 32:05.358
Well, nothing,
but I can understand

32:05.488 --> 32:07.490
why others are jealous
and freaked out.

32:07.621 --> 32:09.753
Don't worry about anybody else.

32:10.929 --> 32:15.324
Why, Orson, do you want
to spend time there?

32:17.936 --> 32:20.503
Well, it makes me feel good.

32:23.593 --> 32:24.507
Okay.

32:33.690 --> 32:35.475
There is no room, Orson.

32:35.605 --> 32:37.303
Yes, there is.
It's right behind the--

32:37.433 --> 32:39.261
Listen to me carefully
now, Orson.

32:39.392 --> 32:41.524
There is no room
next to the elevator.

32:41.655 --> 32:43.265
There's never been a room there.

32:44.875 --> 32:48.227
You've possibly...
created it in your head.

32:49.402 --> 32:51.230
Maybe it's there for you.
I don't know how this
sort of thing--

32:51.360 --> 32:52.666
Fine. Look, if you're
gonna start with--

32:52.796 --> 32:54.581
Listen to me now, Orson.

32:54.711 --> 32:57.453
I must insist that
you stop going to it.

32:59.151 --> 33:03.242
You can't go into
the room anymore.

33:06.027 --> 33:08.856
You telling me that
the room isn't there

33:09.813 --> 33:13.252
is as strange to me
as me telling you

33:13.382 --> 33:16.429
that that chair isn't there.

33:17.865 --> 33:20.476
That chair is there.

33:20.607 --> 33:22.522
I'm glad we can agree on that.

33:26.787 --> 33:30.095
Evidently, things have
changed dramatically.

33:30.225 --> 33:32.010
We knew you were
a complex character,

33:32.140 --> 33:36.144
but no one ever said
you were so...

33:37.058 --> 33:38.712
peculiar.

33:44.848 --> 33:46.763
You'll just have to stop
going to that room.

33:48.287 --> 33:51.072
Otherwise, we'll come up
with a different solution.

33:51.203 --> 33:52.900
Do you understand me?

33:55.990 --> 33:58.688
<i>It doesn't see
very fair, if you ask me.</i>

33:58.819 --> 34:01.213
<i>Why does Andrew get a room,
and I don't?</i>

34:02.170 --> 34:04.912
And I have to ask you
to see a psychiatrist.

34:07.175 --> 34:08.698
And that's how I met you.

34:12.354 --> 34:14.443
So this... room...

34:16.315 --> 34:17.577
What sort of room is it?

34:20.101 --> 34:21.059
An office.

34:23.278 --> 34:24.584
And where is it?

34:26.020 --> 34:27.978
Between the bathroom
and the elevator.

34:30.503 --> 34:31.721
And you go in there?

34:32.592 --> 34:34.420
Yes, but they're saying
that I can't.

34:37.684 --> 34:39.642
You wanna go on sick leave?

34:39.773 --> 34:41.383
- No.
- Oh.

34:48.434 --> 34:53.003
Explain to me why he doesn't
want you to go in the room.

34:53.134 --> 34:54.744
Because he says
it doesn't exist.

34:56.006 --> 34:57.051
So does it?

34:58.531 --> 34:59.575
Yes.

35:01.577 --> 35:02.970
Can you describe it to me?

35:06.582 --> 35:10.282
Everything is exactly
in the right place.

35:12.762 --> 35:15.200
It's nice, but it's not showy.

35:16.375 --> 35:19.595
It's comfortable,
but it's not worn out.

35:21.597 --> 35:25.166
The upholstery
is soft and springy.

35:27.299 --> 35:30.128
The designs, the details,
the patterns are...

35:32.217 --> 35:33.566
unique and tasteful.

35:34.349 --> 35:37.483
The light is soft and warm

35:38.527 --> 35:41.008
and it hits your face
just the right way,

35:41.139 --> 35:44.272
never glinting into your eyes.

35:45.317 --> 35:48.015
Even the records on the shelves
and the books...

35:49.538 --> 35:53.977
perfectly chosen by someone
who, I can only assume,
cares very much.

36:02.203 --> 36:06.468
It sounds lovely.
But, this perfect room...

36:07.469 --> 36:09.210
does it exist for anyone else?

36:10.559 --> 36:13.083
I don't know.
They tell me it doesn't.

36:13.214 --> 36:14.781
But you know it exists.

36:16.783 --> 36:17.697
Yes.

36:20.830 --> 36:22.136
Are we done here?

36:24.791 --> 36:27.794
Is there anything going on
that you need to talk about?

36:27.924 --> 36:29.665
Something stressing you out?

36:30.753 --> 36:32.190
I don't see how that's relevant.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.017
Well, we're here
to talk about Orson.

36:34.148 --> 36:35.628
Do you know who that is?

36:45.420 --> 36:46.421
That settles it.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.946
Orson and I have agreed
to get rid of the room.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.298
You mean...
he's going to stay?

36:53.428 --> 36:55.125
It's a health-and-safety issue.

36:55.256 --> 36:56.518
No, it's not.

36:56.649 --> 36:58.346
If he's allowed
to stand there like that,

36:58.477 --> 37:00.827
then I should be allowed
to practice Reiki
in the break area.

37:01.784 --> 37:04.657
- Hmm.
- Don't we need to be
functioning at full capacity?

37:04.787 --> 37:07.442
Seriously, he's fucking crazy.
You have to admit that.

37:07.573 --> 37:09.183
<i>She said there was
nothing wrong with me,</i>

37:09.314 --> 37:12.447
<i>and that I'm perfectly capable
of continuing to work,</i>

37:12.578 --> 37:14.493
<i>and Andrew knows it.</i>

37:14.623 --> 37:16.234
He's perfectly capable
of working.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.453
Hm, I've seen the report.

37:19.498 --> 37:20.977
I'm inclined to agree.

37:21.108 --> 37:23.980
But he's mental.
Anyone can see that.

37:24.111 --> 37:26.592
Surely we can't have a moron
who goes and stares at the wall

37:26.722 --> 37:28.158
the minute things get busy.

37:29.290 --> 37:31.249
Although I do think
we all should be allowed

37:31.379 --> 37:34.208
to do what we like
during our breaks.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.297
I'm not so sure about that.

37:36.428 --> 37:39.126
I say fire him.

37:40.693 --> 37:43.957
Orson has been carrying out
his duties faultlessly.

37:44.740 --> 37:46.481
Really, we oughta feel
sorry for him.

37:51.181 --> 37:52.835
- Andrew's right.

37:52.966 --> 37:55.229
There's no justification
for firing him.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.883
Listen, I don't give
a shit what he does,

37:57.013 --> 37:59.015
but he keeps dragging the rest
of us over there as well.

37:59.146 --> 38:00.539
Exactly.

38:00.669 --> 38:02.018
I think it's creepy

38:02.149 --> 38:04.543
seeing him stand there
like that.

38:04.673 --> 38:06.196
It's like he's just not there.

38:07.328 --> 38:08.634
Why don't we say...

38:10.940 --> 38:16.206
it's okay, as long as Orson
doesn't go into the room?

38:19.514 --> 38:21.777
- I could say that.
- Are you serious?

38:27.566 --> 38:28.567
It's okay.

38:29.481 --> 38:31.091
It's okay.

38:32.048 --> 38:34.137
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

38:34.268 --> 38:35.356
Yeah, it's good.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.228
<i>I did my best
to imitate the others</i>

38:38.359 --> 38:40.622
<i>and pretend the room
didn't exist.</i>

38:42.320 --> 38:44.017
<i>It felt ridiculous.</i>

38:47.455 --> 38:50.458
<i>When they were all at lunch,
I couldn't see any reason</i>

38:50.589 --> 38:52.895
<i>not to go in there
for a short while.</i>

40:03.357 --> 40:04.793
I saw what you did.

40:07.927 --> 40:09.668
Don't act all innocent,
I saw you.

40:10.538 --> 40:11.757
If I see you again...

40:12.845 --> 40:13.846
I'll tell.

40:16.501 --> 40:17.893
<i>Whenever anyone
looked at me,</i>

40:18.024 --> 40:19.852
<i>I fired off a broad smile.</i>

40:20.983 --> 40:22.898
<i>A smile disarms your opponent</i>

40:23.029 --> 40:25.379
<i>and makes them doubt
their own enmity.</i>

40:30.993 --> 40:33.039
Hmm. How's it going, Rakesh?

40:34.040 --> 40:36.216
- Good. Yeah, good.
- Great.

40:36.346 --> 40:38.827
No problems then, huh?

40:38.958 --> 40:40.133
No, everything's fine.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.657
Excellent.

40:44.833 --> 40:46.008
How are things
with you, then?

40:48.924 --> 40:50.012
What sort of things?

40:51.579 --> 40:55.365
Well, what have you spent
the last few days doing?

40:56.758 --> 40:58.238
Why do you need to know?

40:58.368 --> 41:00.893
- Because I'm your boss.

41:01.023 --> 41:02.808
I'm working on
an improved metric

41:02.938 --> 41:05.158
for customer service
here in the division.

41:07.334 --> 41:08.291
What is this?

41:08.422 --> 41:09.728
I plan to use it to measure

41:09.858 --> 41:11.643
the benefits I'm providing
my customers.

41:11.773 --> 41:14.297
Uh, to that purpose,
I've created a questionnaire

41:14.428 --> 41:17.300
that's meant to find out
what you customers think
of my services.

41:18.563 --> 41:19.999
"Us customers"?

41:20.129 --> 41:21.609
I usually think of you
as customers.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.785
What for, huh?

41:23.916 --> 41:25.874
Are you really asking me that?

41:26.005 --> 41:26.919
Yes.

41:28.094 --> 41:30.183
I am really asking you that.

41:31.271 --> 41:35.014
You maximize your potential
better if you imagine
a customer on the other end.

41:36.668 --> 41:37.582
Huh.

41:38.670 --> 41:39.627
Hmm.

41:40.454 --> 41:42.761
So I would be grateful
if you could fill out
this questionnaire

41:42.891 --> 41:44.937
which you can find
by clicking this link here.

41:45.067 --> 41:48.027
There are five questions
in the survey relating
to the quality of our services,

41:48.157 --> 41:50.072
and one question asking
if there are any other services

41:50.203 --> 41:51.944
you can think of
that we should provide.

41:52.074 --> 41:54.468
Home number, cell number,
although, of course,
that's voluntary,

41:54.599 --> 41:56.905
but I'd be grateful if you could
fill out the questionnaire

41:57.036 --> 41:58.341
as fully as possible.

42:00.735 --> 42:03.477
But, Orson, I asked you
to compile a list
of phone numbers,

42:05.044 --> 42:06.045
didn't I?

42:16.055 --> 42:17.622
<i>All my energy
drained away.</i>

42:18.971 --> 42:21.756
<i>I suddenly had
difficulty concentrating,</i>

42:21.887 --> 42:24.542
<i>and a stiffness spread
across my shoulders.</i>

42:38.294 --> 42:39.905
<i>After three days
without the room,</i>

42:40.035 --> 42:42.124
<i>I started to feel unsettled.</i>

42:42.255 --> 42:45.737
<i>I became irritable and noticed
I was sweating more than usual.</i>

42:46.825 --> 42:50.698
<i>The most acute
abstinence anxiety
was starting to subside,</i>

42:50.829 --> 42:53.701
<i>but it was as if the habit
was still in my body.</i>

43:02.144 --> 43:04.016
<i>I constantly had to stop myself</i>

43:04.146 --> 43:08.063
<i>when I realized my body
was on its way there
of its own accord,</i>

43:08.194 --> 43:11.501
<i>like an ex-smoker fumbling
for a pack of cigarettes.</i>

43:12.894 --> 43:15.027
<i>I tried to think about
something else,</i>

43:15.157 --> 43:19.031
<i>and every time I felt the urge,
I counted down from 20.</i>

43:44.447 --> 43:45.797
<i>I didn't go in.</i>

43:45.927 --> 43:47.059
<i>I'm sure of that.</i>

43:56.416 --> 43:58.200
<i>The next morning, I woke up
thinking about the room.</i>

43:58.331 --> 43:59.898
...then a left,
and then another right,

44:00.028 --> 44:01.421
- and then a left door...
- <i>I tried to distract myself</i>

44:01.551 --> 44:03.118
<i>by indulging
in some light small talk</i>

44:03.249 --> 44:04.946
<i>with that engaging woman
in reception.</i>

44:05.077 --> 44:06.469
Good morning.

44:08.950 --> 44:10.691
I bet you say that
to all the guys.

44:11.779 --> 44:12.867
Yeah, I do.

44:15.783 --> 44:18.612
Uh, you don't have
any floor plans back there,

44:19.744 --> 44:20.745
do you?

44:22.224 --> 44:23.573
Floor plans?

44:24.749 --> 44:28.883
Uh, blueprints,
like, maps of the building.

44:30.102 --> 44:33.148
No. I can help you find
anywhere you're trying to go.

44:36.804 --> 44:39.415
No, that's okay. I'll-- I'll--
I'll figure it out.

44:39.546 --> 44:41.504
Okay. Are you sure?
It's kind of my job.

44:41.635 --> 44:44.333
No. No, I'll... I'll be okay.

44:54.256 --> 44:55.954
<i>I went up
to the fourth floor, got out,</i>

44:56.084 --> 44:57.695
<i>and was almost at the door.</i>

45:02.787 --> 45:04.353
<i>I crept toward
the forbidden place</i>

45:04.484 --> 45:06.181
<i>like a child
on Christmas morning,</i>

45:06.312 --> 45:08.923
<i>stopped right next to it,</i>

45:09.054 --> 45:12.013
<i>stood there feeling what
it was like to be so close.</i>

45:15.147 --> 45:18.628
No. No, no, it's not
what you think.

45:25.070 --> 45:26.549
- He was there again.
- I wasn't.

45:26.680 --> 45:28.116
- I saw you.
- No.

45:28.247 --> 45:30.466
I-- I saw you. You were
standing like that again.

45:30.597 --> 45:32.207
No, I was just standing.

45:32.338 --> 45:34.296
He was just standing.

45:34.993 --> 45:36.559
- That's what I'm saying.
- Yeah, well,

45:36.690 --> 45:38.605
people are allowed
to stand still.

45:38.736 --> 45:41.042
No one can stop you
just standing there
for a moment.

45:41.173 --> 45:42.914
Orson, how long
are we talking about here?

45:43.044 --> 45:44.959
Minutes? Seconds?

45:45.090 --> 45:46.482
I didn't go inside.

45:50.269 --> 45:53.707
He didn't go inside.

45:59.408 --> 46:01.976
<i>Word spread from Carol
like a group email.</i>

46:02.977 --> 46:05.806
<i>During the day,
practically everyone
passed her desk,</i>

46:05.937 --> 46:09.331
<i>and before they walked on,
they managed to glance
in my direction.</i>

46:10.332 --> 46:12.857
<i>I decided to go home
slightly early that day.</i>

46:13.814 --> 46:15.294
<i>I wasn't feeling very well.</i>

46:41.320 --> 46:43.757
<i>I had forgotten how difficult
it was to locate my car</i>

46:43.888 --> 46:45.541
<i>in the parking lot
at that time,</i>

46:45.672 --> 46:47.935
<i>used, as I was,
to leaving later
than everyone else</i>

46:48.066 --> 46:49.850
<i>when the lot was mostly empty.</i>

47:06.345 --> 47:10.131
<i>For the first time,
I realized how weird I'd been.</i>

47:10.262 --> 47:12.220
<i>Thinking about all
the stupid things I had done</i>

47:12.351 --> 47:14.440
<i>and what they had led to
gave me a headache.</i>

47:16.398 --> 47:18.139
<i>If I was to get where I wanted,</i>

47:18.270 --> 47:21.316
<i>I would need to adopt
an entirely new
tactical approach.</i>

47:30.891 --> 47:32.153
<i>How high can I get?</i>

47:33.807 --> 47:36.462
<i>If I carry on like this,
who could stop me?</i>

47:53.609 --> 47:55.873
- Why are you late?
-  I overslept.

47:56.003 --> 48:00.051
I'm very sorry. I--
I had trouble falling asleep.

48:02.183 --> 48:03.924
I lay there thinking...

48:04.055 --> 48:06.187
thinking about recent events,

48:06.318 --> 48:09.016
things that I've said,
and done, and so on, and...

48:10.278 --> 48:12.541
I can see I've been
behaving strangely,

48:13.499 --> 48:15.066
and I'd like to do
what I can to...

48:16.545 --> 48:18.983
well, to make right
any problems
I may have caused.

48:20.245 --> 48:23.074
Orson. Orson, Orson.

48:26.251 --> 48:28.296
But, I know I've caused
problems for you too,

48:28.427 --> 48:30.168
and I'd like to ask
for your forgiveness.

48:30.298 --> 48:32.648
It was never my intention
to cause any trouble.

48:33.693 --> 48:37.175
I can promise you,
from here on out,
there will be no more of that.

48:39.873 --> 48:41.135
Sit down.

48:43.964 --> 48:45.357
You're an unusual person.

48:46.924 --> 48:48.882
I'm glad you've taken the time
to think things through.

48:49.013 --> 48:52.277
Maybe it was worth
getting a late start.

48:52.407 --> 48:54.496
Obviously, I'll make up
for any time I've lost.

48:54.627 --> 48:56.716
Don't worry about that.
If we can get you back on track,

48:56.846 --> 48:59.849
this little break will have been
entirely justified. So,

49:01.155 --> 49:03.201
we're agreed on the rules now?

49:04.158 --> 49:06.944
- Yes.
- And we can forget
all about the...?

49:10.773 --> 49:11.774
Of course.

49:12.601 --> 49:15.169
No one will be happier than I...

49:15.300 --> 49:17.432
if we can find a solution
to this.

49:17.563 --> 49:22.220
Oh, and I've, uh, finished
that list of phone numbers
you asked for.

49:22.350 --> 49:25.963
Oh, excellent.
Do you know what?
Tomorrow...

49:26.093 --> 49:28.835
could you put together
a list of which projects
have gone through QA

49:28.966 --> 49:31.490
and which ones haven't?
It'd be good to have
that on paper.

49:32.447 --> 49:33.796
And you can tell
where they come from by--

49:33.927 --> 49:35.146
Oh, yeah. I know.

49:35.973 --> 49:37.975
Look to see if there
are two signatures
at the bottom of the report.

49:38.105 --> 49:39.802
I can-- I can do it.

49:39.933 --> 49:40.890
Great.

49:50.683 --> 49:52.076
<i>Owing to my late start,</i>

49:52.206 --> 49:54.252
<i>I thought I may as well
stay a bit late.</i>

49:58.952 --> 50:02.738
<i>An hour or so later,
I took the elevator
straight to the lobby,</i>

50:02.869 --> 50:04.436
<i>without passing the room.</i>

50:20.539 --> 50:24.108
<i>The threat of closure
hung like an evil spirit
over the whole division.</i>

50:25.457 --> 50:28.286
<i>Rakesh and Andrew
had endless heated discussions,</i>

50:28.416 --> 50:31.463
<i>which always ended with talk
about the possibility
of the entire company</i>

50:31.593 --> 50:33.291
- <i>being closed down.</i>

50:33.421 --> 50:36.555
<i>I assumed this was management
keeping us on our toes</i>

50:36.685 --> 50:38.992
<i>and not letting anyone think
they were safe.</i>

50:41.429 --> 50:43.518
- If this works...
- I don't understand
what you're...

50:45.651 --> 50:48.175
Okay, I'm telling you,
I can't produce a clearer text

50:48.306 --> 50:49.916
- from this--
- Of course, you can.

50:50.047 --> 50:51.918
<i>Just before lunch,
another printout</i>

50:52.049 --> 50:53.615
<i>was delivered
to Andrew's office.</i>

50:57.576 --> 50:59.012
Uh, what shall I do now?

51:01.362 --> 51:02.276
Hmm?

51:03.190 --> 51:05.714
If there's perhaps,
any messaging

51:05.845 --> 51:07.803
or clarity issues
in any of the texts?

51:07.934 --> 51:09.066
What are you thinking?

51:11.068 --> 51:13.592
I was just wondering
if I could help.

51:15.637 --> 51:17.204
No, thanks.

51:17.335 --> 51:19.119
I don't think so. It'll be fine.

51:20.990 --> 51:22.427
Oh, but you could...

51:24.516 --> 51:28.737
check all the printers.
Make sure there's
enough paper, and so on.

51:40.836 --> 51:43.012
<i>I realized
that my humiliation
had to be dragged</i>

51:43.143 --> 51:44.753
<i>right down to the very bottom.</i>

51:45.754 --> 51:47.582
<i>I didn't mind.</i>

51:47.713 --> 51:49.454
<i>It was all part of the plan.</i>

51:49.584 --> 51:50.890
...shuffled up
or shuffled down?

51:51.020 --> 51:53.110
What the hell
does "shuffled" mean?

51:53.240 --> 51:54.720
I don't think
I'm comfortable with people
knowing about my shuffling.

51:54.850 --> 51:57.592
It's probably just when
they put you in a position

51:57.723 --> 52:00.247
- that is basically
the equivalent of--
- Mm-hmm.

52:04.860 --> 52:07.950
<i>I took care
to participate in all
the group coffee breaks.</i>

52:08.081 --> 52:09.561
<i>I was taking part.</i>

52:09.691 --> 52:13.173
<i>I was there as a physical
presence among them.</i>

52:13.304 --> 52:17.264
So, like I was saying,
these cutbacks are killing us.

52:17.395 --> 52:19.266
<i>They got used to me.</i>

52:19.397 --> 52:21.616
<i>I assumed the role
of passive participant,</i>

52:21.747 --> 52:23.488
<i>the person no one
really notices,</i>

52:23.618 --> 52:25.272
<i>but whose presence
is a precondition</i>

52:25.403 --> 52:27.666
<i>for the general character
of social interaction.</i>

52:27.796 --> 52:29.102
You have excellent productivity.

52:29.233 --> 52:31.496
<i>It really was astonishing</i>

52:31.626 --> 52:33.759
<i>that still,
no one had fixed the light.</i>

52:33.889 --> 52:35.326
I thought your numbers
were down a bit.

52:35.456 --> 52:37.023
<i>How many office workers
does it take</i>

52:37.154 --> 52:38.981
- <i>to screw in a light bulb?</i>
- She's got excellent--

52:42.768 --> 52:44.683
<i>No sooner had I returned
to my place</i>

52:44.813 --> 52:49.296
<i>when I saw that the inevitable,
dreaded moment
was finally upon me.</i>

52:49.427 --> 52:53.387
<i>Rakesh's papers had finally
overflowed onto my desk.</i>

52:53.518 --> 52:55.650
<i>I shoved the whole pile
back onto his side,</i>

52:55.781 --> 52:59.045
<i>causing some of the files
to fall on the floor.</i>

53:07.619 --> 53:11.013
<i>When Rakesh came back,
I felt a pang
of my old intolerance,</i>

53:11.144 --> 53:14.669
<i>a gust of my old self
who had been
far too excitable,</i>

53:14.800 --> 53:17.803
<i>too guileless,
in purely tactical terms.</i>

53:18.804 --> 53:21.459
<i>My initial impulse
was to repeat the procedure</i>

53:21.589 --> 53:23.852
<i>and this time push everything
a bit further,</i>

53:25.158 --> 53:27.334
<i>but then it dawned on me...</i>

53:27.465 --> 53:30.207
<i>this was the opportunity
I had been waiting for.</i>

53:30.337 --> 53:32.078
<i>Without even asking for it,</i>

53:32.209 --> 53:34.211
<i>I had been given
a helping hand.</i>

53:37.605 --> 53:40.869
<i>An almost meditative calm
spread through me.</i>

53:43.655 --> 53:45.744
<i>Rakesh spent a large part
of the afternoon</i>

53:45.874 --> 53:48.486
<i>trying in vain to find
the missing case file.</i>

53:49.878 --> 53:52.925
<i>He didn't say anything,
but I know that's
what he was doing.</i>

55:18.315 --> 55:21.883
<i>And that's when I slipped
inside the room
for the eighth time.</i>

55:34.592 --> 55:37.421
<i>Formulations that would usually
take a long time to grasp</i>

55:37.551 --> 55:41.294
<i>flowed into my consciousness
in a perfectly natural way.</i>

55:41.425 --> 55:43.209
<i>I understood at once.</i>

55:44.123 --> 55:45.559
<i>Most of it seemed obvious,</i>

55:45.690 --> 55:47.082
<i>like I'd been asked
to fill in the answers</i>

55:47.213 --> 55:48.649
<i>in a second-grade math book.</i>

55:52.958 --> 55:55.787
<i>I formulated a couple
simple phrases in my head,</i>

55:55.917 --> 55:57.049
<i>simple and clear.</i>

55:58.050 --> 56:00.095
<i>It was as if I had
cleaned the document</i>

56:00.226 --> 56:02.750
<i>in order to reveal
its pure lines.</i>

56:20.420 --> 56:23.597
That's exactly what I meant.
It's brilliant, Rakesh.

56:23.728 --> 56:26.513
Fopdoodlin' genius,
factual and concise,

56:26.644 --> 56:28.602
no room for misunderstanding.

56:35.827 --> 56:37.219
- That isn't mine.
- What?

56:41.441 --> 56:42.790
Boss, I didn't write it.

56:46.272 --> 56:48.013
What do you mean
you didn't write it?

56:51.451 --> 56:53.061
Someone else
must have written it.

57:16.824 --> 57:17.738
Carol!

57:19.174 --> 57:20.088
Mitchie?

57:22.613 --> 57:24.832
<i>If one of them
had falsely taken credit
for my work,</i>

57:24.963 --> 57:26.791
<i>the situation would have
been even better.</i>

57:27.574 --> 57:31.404
<i>We would've been able
to increase the bounce
of my trampoline, so to speak.</i>

57:31.535 --> 57:35.147
<i>But, evidently, neither of them
was brazen enough.</i>

57:42.328 --> 57:44.983
<i>When the working day was over
and everyone had gone home,</i>

57:45.113 --> 57:46.854
<i>I felt my heart begin to pound.</i>

57:47.768 --> 57:50.075
<i>It felt like
I was robbing Fort Knox.</i>

57:55.733 --> 57:59.476
<i>I started work on case 1842.</i>

57:59.606 --> 58:02.087
<i>The whole process
went much quicker this time.</i>

58:02.217 --> 58:05.394
<i>It was like I'd learned
something about the way
things fit together,</i>

58:05.525 --> 58:08.963
<i>something about the way
time and space interact.</i>

58:11.052 --> 58:13.838
<i>At last, I'd found a structure
that suited me.</i>

58:26.415 --> 58:27.895
Shannon, is this your 1842?

58:28.026 --> 58:30.071
Do you recognize this form? No?

58:39.864 --> 58:43.563
<i>The next day,
I repeated the process
with case 1199.</i>

58:59.100 --> 59:02.190
<i>I felt her eyes on me
the moment I entered
the little glass cube.</i>

59:10.503 --> 59:12.157
<i>And just after Andrew arrived,</i>

59:12.287 --> 59:14.942
<i>sure enough,
there she was, telling tales.</i>

59:21.079 --> 59:22.820
<i>I couldn't have
arranged it better.</i>

59:33.004 --> 59:36.050
I understand you're the one
who left this on my desk.

59:39.880 --> 59:40.881
Who wrote it?

59:42.535 --> 59:43.580
I did.

59:44.929 --> 59:48.149
Who... Who asked
you to write it?

59:49.063 --> 59:51.588
I just took it for granted
it was my responsibility,

59:51.718 --> 59:53.633
seeing as how the files
were on my desk.

59:56.418 --> 59:57.594
Who put it there?

59:59.117 --> 01:00:00.118
I have no idea.

01:00:00.248 --> 01:00:01.423
- Please.
- I just assume--

01:00:03.121 --> 01:00:04.122
Follow me.

01:00:10.258 --> 01:00:11.477
Close the door, please.

01:00:17.788 --> 01:00:19.050
What's going on, Orson?

01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:24.446
Oh, I-- I didn't mean
to cause any trouble.

01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:27.014
I-- I wasn't trying to take
someone else's work.

01:00:27.145 --> 01:00:28.320
I just assumed that...

01:00:29.974 --> 01:00:32.498
I was supposed to do it
because the case files
were on my desk.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:36.545
Can you tell me who wrote
cases 1834 and 1636?

01:00:36.676 --> 01:00:37.634
I did.

01:00:40.593 --> 01:00:41.986
The truth now, Orson.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.728
That is the truth.

01:00:49.863 --> 01:00:51.212
The EVP...

01:00:52.823 --> 01:00:55.695
- is very pleased.
- Oh?

01:00:55.826 --> 01:00:59.046
He says we've finally found
the right tone. Hm.

01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:04.182
These texts ought to be
the template
for all future decisions.

01:01:04.312 --> 01:01:06.358
I, I... I...

01:01:08.447 --> 01:01:09.622
I didn't know.

01:01:13.408 --> 01:01:15.541
<i> I could've exploited
my lowly status</i>

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.761
<i>and made the turnaround
even greater,</i>

01:01:17.891 --> 01:01:20.677
<i>even more of a shock,
but this was where we were.</i>

01:01:21.808 --> 01:01:24.550
<i>At last, he had realized,</i>

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.684
<i>and maybe I should be happy
that he was at least
intelligent enough</i>

01:01:27.814 --> 01:01:29.686
<i>to recognize talent
when he saw it.</i>

01:01:31.078 --> 01:01:32.340
You surprise.

01:01:38.346 --> 01:01:41.175
I think it would be best...

01:01:41.306 --> 01:01:42.960
...if you felt you could
handle some more.

01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:44.701
I'd be happy to help
in any way that I can,

01:01:44.831 --> 01:01:47.965
but bearing in mind
my other duties,

01:01:48.095 --> 01:01:51.620
I just think finding the time
to look after the printers
is-- is...

01:01:51.751 --> 01:01:53.448
Obviously, you wouldn't have
to do any more of that.

01:01:53.579 --> 01:01:55.059
Quality assurance is...

01:01:57.148 --> 01:02:00.542
I'm sorry, Orson,
if I underestimated you.

01:02:00.673 --> 01:02:03.502
It isn't always easy
to see the skills
of your fellow colleagues,

01:02:03.632 --> 01:02:05.852
especially not... Ah.

01:02:10.944 --> 01:02:12.119
I apologize.

01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:16.254
<i>Knowing when to keep
your mouth shut is an art.</i>

01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:19.431
Had a lot going on recently.

01:02:22.303 --> 01:02:24.610
<i>I could've easily drawn
this out a bit longer.</i>

01:02:32.183 --> 01:02:34.576
Apology accepted.

01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:37.144
Thank you.

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:42.106
<i>A short time later,
I was able to run my fingers
slowly over the numbers</i>

01:02:42.236 --> 01:02:43.760
<i>on the cover
of a brand-new edition</i>

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:46.327
<i>of our company's
gold standard reference.</i>

01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:48.547
Good morning.
How can I help you?

01:02:48.677 --> 01:02:51.332
Uh, I'd like to see
revision 16-C.

01:02:51.463 --> 01:02:53.160
One moment, please.

01:03:08.393 --> 01:03:10.787
<i>From the way she looked at me,
I could tell she'd
caught a glimpse</i>

01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:12.658
<i>of the author's name
on the spine.</i>

01:03:13.659 --> 01:03:15.617
<i>She seemed suitably impressed.</i>

01:03:15.748 --> 01:03:16.880
Excuse me.

01:03:17.837 --> 01:03:21.928
It's none of my business,
but did you write that?

01:03:24.278 --> 01:03:25.714
It's mine.

01:03:25.845 --> 01:03:27.325
Congratulations.

01:03:27.455 --> 01:03:28.979
I hear it's now
the standard framework

01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:31.111
being used for case
decisions company-wide.

01:03:33.287 --> 01:03:34.680
That's very gratifying.

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:37.204
I only started working
here recently.

01:03:37.335 --> 01:03:40.425
It's taken me a while to get
the swing of things, but, uh...

01:03:40.555 --> 01:03:42.209
Yes, I've seen you come in.

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.821
You're always a little early.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:48.650
I like to keep
to a specific schedule.

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:51.915
Well, seems to be
working out for you.

01:03:52.045 --> 01:03:53.351
What's your secret?

01:04:02.534 --> 01:04:04.579
I actually do have
a small secret.

01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:06.581
- Oh?
- Would you like
to know what it is?

01:04:06.712 --> 01:04:07.887
Yeah.

01:04:09.367 --> 01:04:10.368
I don't know.

01:04:11.282 --> 01:04:12.849
Come on. You have to tell me.

01:04:12.979 --> 01:04:14.633
You can't tease
a girl like that.

01:04:14.763 --> 01:04:16.809
You promise not to tell anyone?

01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:20.508
All right, fine. I promise.

01:04:23.555 --> 01:04:27.211
I found a secret room,
and when I work in there,
I'm able to do anything.

01:04:30.518 --> 01:04:31.998
A secret room.

01:04:33.217 --> 01:04:34.958
- Here, in the building?
- On the fourth floor.

01:04:36.002 --> 01:04:39.092
Is it like a bookshelf
you push away, or...?

01:04:39.223 --> 01:04:41.616
Nothing like that.
It's just a regular door.

01:04:41.747 --> 01:04:44.358
It's just that most people
aren't able to see it.

01:04:46.491 --> 01:04:47.405
Yeah.

01:04:48.797 --> 01:04:50.538
People are like that sometimes.

01:04:53.237 --> 01:04:54.673
Yeah.

01:04:54.803 --> 01:04:56.196
What's the room like inside?

01:04:58.068 --> 01:05:00.374
I mean, comfortable.

01:05:01.288 --> 01:05:02.811
Maybe a little old-fashioned.

01:05:05.031 --> 01:05:06.511
Sounds nice.

01:05:19.567 --> 01:05:20.960
<i>Rumors of my success</i>

01:05:21.091 --> 01:05:23.484
<i>swept through the whole
division like a wave.</i>

01:05:23.615 --> 01:05:26.183
How can he be
so good at this?

01:05:26.313 --> 01:05:29.577
So you're telling me
he could do this all along?

01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:31.318
Maybe he's
some kind of savant.

01:05:44.027 --> 01:05:45.376
Hey.

01:05:45.506 --> 01:05:48.466
So, um, how come
you can suddenly--

01:05:48.596 --> 01:05:50.685
I mean, we had no idea.

01:05:50.816 --> 01:05:53.819
Hard work. As Aristotle said,
"Excellence is a habit."

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:58.215
Huh. But, um, how do you
go about it, exactly?

01:06:00.086 --> 01:06:01.914
Obviously, each individual
has different ways

01:06:02.045 --> 01:06:03.437
of reaching a decision.

01:06:03.568 --> 01:06:05.918
Some people find it hard
or they can feel strange.

01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:08.965
I find it very easy
to make decisions,
it comes very naturally to me.

01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:14.753
And I think you'll understand
that, uh, I can't reveal
my reasoning.

01:06:14.883 --> 01:06:19.018
That would be both impossible
and undesirable.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:22.761
The best thing for the company,
and for you yourself,

01:06:22.891 --> 01:06:26.373
would be for you to work out
your way of reasoning
on your own.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:41.171
-  Um...

01:06:44.696 --> 01:06:45.740
Mm...

01:06:49.657 --> 01:06:52.182
So how long were you
planning on keeping
your talent hidden, then?

01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:57.578
Do you think it's funny
going around
pretending you're unstable

01:06:57.709 --> 01:07:00.842
just so you can show everyone
your tightrope routine later on?

01:07:05.934 --> 01:07:07.545
When did you steal those files?

01:07:11.984 --> 01:07:14.160
Don't you think you should go
and change your shirt?

01:07:26.172 --> 01:07:28.044
<i>Soon,
the open-floor-plan
office around me</i>

01:07:28.174 --> 01:07:30.437
<i>was full of protracted
and unstructured discussion</i>

01:07:30.568 --> 01:07:32.048
<i>about the coming
Christmas party.</i>

01:07:32.178 --> 01:07:34.659
Is Shannon gonna make
that awful tropical punch again?

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:37.270
<i>I did my best to stay out
of the whole fractured debate.</i>

01:07:37.401 --> 01:07:39.142
Why don't you make the punch
this year, hmm?

01:07:39.272 --> 01:07:42.188
- I can really use the help.
- Oh, sure, love to.

01:07:44.408 --> 01:07:47.846
Orson, haven't heard
back from you about
the Christmas party.

01:07:47.976 --> 01:07:49.021
You coming?

01:07:49.935 --> 01:07:52.285
<i>I used Carol's trick
of completely ignoring her</i>

01:07:52.416 --> 01:07:54.200
<i>and carrying on with my work.</i>

01:08:02.165 --> 01:08:05.255
<i>With all the commotion,
it would be impossible
to get into the room</i>

01:08:05.385 --> 01:08:07.170
- <i>without being detected.</i>

01:08:08.345 --> 01:08:11.435

and left.</i>

<i>It was obvious that they were
all more relaxed than usual.</i>

01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:13.453
Just a heads up. It's gonna take
about six of these

01:09:13.584 --> 01:09:16.239
to equal one shot of liquor,
so drink up.

01:09:17.805 --> 01:09:20.156
How's that punch?
It's got guava in it.

01:09:20.286 --> 01:09:21.505
I don't taste guava.

01:09:22.419 --> 01:09:23.724
It's in there.

01:09:23.855 --> 01:09:25.117
I don't taste guava.

01:09:27.032 --> 01:09:28.686
<i>I had to agree
with Rakesh</i>

01:09:28.816 --> 01:09:30.775
<i>that it was hard
to taste the guava.</i>

01:09:30.905 --> 01:09:32.733
<i>I resolved to drink
my cup slowly,</i>

01:09:32.864 --> 01:09:34.822
<i>so as not to lose my composure.</i>

01:09:34.953 --> 01:09:37.085
<i>This was a work party,
after all.</i>

01:09:37.216 --> 01:09:39.784
Oh. Congratulations.

01:09:39.914 --> 01:09:42.569
It's great that things
are going so well for you.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:45.006
- Thanks, Mitchell.

01:09:45.137 --> 01:09:46.617
Sorry about what I said before.

01:09:46.747 --> 01:09:49.054
You know how things get
in a stressful workplace.

01:09:50.142 --> 01:09:53.624
But I'm really pleased that
you're back on track again.

01:09:53.754 --> 01:09:56.670
I just wanted you to know.
I mean, even the EVP is pleased.

01:09:56.801 --> 01:10:00.500
<i>People made various
excruciating attempts
to engage me in conversation.</i>

01:10:00.631 --> 01:10:02.850
You might manage
to save all our jobs.

01:10:02.981 --> 01:10:05.201
<i>As you might imagine,
it was a pointless task.</i>

01:10:11.642 --> 01:10:13.644
<i>Outside, the snow
was still falling.</i>

01:10:17.256 --> 01:10:19.737
<i>I'd just made up my mind
to leave when...</i>

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:27.397
Oh, uh...

01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:31.444
I didn't expect
to see you here.

01:10:31.575 --> 01:10:33.490
I get invited
to all the parties.

01:10:34.534 --> 01:10:36.797
I guess everyone thinks
I don't have my own division.

01:10:37.842 --> 01:10:40.148
Oh. Oh, let's see,
there must be, what...

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.456
- Twenty-eight divisions.
- Twenty-nine, actually.

01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:46.154
Maintenance has
their own division.

01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:47.678
A lot of people forget.

01:10:49.723 --> 01:10:51.682
They invite me
to their party as well.

01:10:53.074 --> 01:10:54.206
Well, that's not fair.

01:10:58.297 --> 01:11:00.430
You really do have
a firm grasp of details.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.996
That's very admirable.

01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:05.086
Do you know how many employees
we have here in the building?

01:11:08.873 --> 01:11:12.093
- Well, there's you and me--
- Sixteen hundred forty-seven.

01:11:13.007 --> 01:11:15.749
Wow, that is--
that is something.

01:11:18.404 --> 01:11:20.145
My name's Alyssa, by the way.

01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:24.236
<i>She looked like
she was expecting a reply,</i>

01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:27.500
<i>but what could I possibly
have to say about her name?</i>

01:11:27.631 --> 01:11:29.241
<i>Her name was Alyssa.</i>

01:11:29.894 --> 01:11:32.113
<i>"Okay"? "Good"?</i>

01:11:32.244 --> 01:11:33.811
<i>"Nice name"?</i>

01:11:33.941 --> 01:11:37.118
I-- I don't-- I don't care much
for the Christmas lights.

01:11:37.249 --> 01:11:39.817
No. I think Shannon put them up.

01:11:41.993 --> 01:11:43.560
Wow, you sure do know a lot.

01:11:48.652 --> 01:11:50.001
Would you like a glass?

01:11:57.095 --> 01:11:58.792
<i>I recalled a man
from out of town</i>

01:11:58.923 --> 01:12:00.664
<i>who took me
on a bar crawl once,</i>

01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:04.407
<i>and insisted on us drinking
until the last bar closed.</i>

01:12:05.103 --> 01:12:07.453
<i>I felt sick
for a week afterwards.</i>

01:12:07.584 --> 01:12:09.673
All right,
I'm dying of curiosity.

01:12:09.803 --> 01:12:10.978
You-- You are?

01:12:13.285 --> 01:12:14.286
The room.

01:12:15.722 --> 01:12:17.028
The famous room.

01:12:20.684 --> 01:12:22.207
Oh, um...

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:24.035
Wouldn't you like
to show it to me?

01:12:45.535 --> 01:12:46.405
Um...

01:12:49.495 --> 01:12:51.454
There it is. Do you see?

01:12:54.587 --> 01:12:55.458
No.

01:12:57.198 --> 01:12:58.243
But I want to.

01:12:59.679 --> 01:13:01.072
Oh, well...

01:13:02.465 --> 01:13:03.379
Um...

01:13:07.034 --> 01:13:10.429
Okay, this is the... door frame.

01:13:11.952 --> 01:13:14.041
- Yeah?
- Okay.

01:13:16.304 --> 01:13:17.915
Put my hand on the doorknob.

01:13:27.794 --> 01:13:28.969
Am I holding it?

01:13:30.623 --> 01:13:31.494
Yes.

01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:37.151
Go ahead and open the door.

01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:49.686
Oh, Orson.

01:13:51.296 --> 01:13:52.645
It's perfect.

01:13:53.994 --> 01:13:55.213
Do you like it?

01:13:55.343 --> 01:13:56.257
Yes.

01:13:57.476 --> 01:13:58.434
It's...

01:13:59.783 --> 01:14:00.653
Well...

01:14:03.134 --> 01:14:04.265
It's you.

01:14:05.919 --> 01:14:06.877
What do you mean?

01:14:07.704 --> 01:14:09.662
You're different
from the other people here.

01:14:09.793 --> 01:14:10.750
I can tell.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.058
They just want to succeed.

01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:17.757
I want to succeed.

01:14:18.889 --> 01:14:23.328
Yeah, I know, but you aren't
only in it to make money.

01:14:24.677 --> 01:14:29.334
Well, I want to make money,
of course, but...

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:31.162
- Money isn't everything.
- Money isn't everything.

01:14:40.998 --> 01:14:43.740
You know, the way I see it...

01:14:44.871 --> 01:14:46.786
everyone needs this, right?

01:14:48.353 --> 01:14:50.398
A place that's only theirs.

01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:52.836
And this is yours.

01:14:56.622 --> 01:15:00.147
Don't you think this is a place
where you can be yourself?

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:06.937
A private space that you share
only with someone close...

01:15:08.852 --> 01:15:11.202
someone just like you.

01:15:17.121 --> 01:15:20.428
I think that I know
everything there is
to know about you.

01:15:22.953 --> 01:15:24.215
What do you think about that?

01:15:26.739 --> 01:15:27.610
Yeah.

01:15:30.961 --> 01:15:33.746
You know, it sounds crazy,

01:15:33.877 --> 01:15:35.705
but all day long,

01:15:35.835 --> 01:15:37.837
I'm just smiling at people,

01:15:37.968 --> 01:15:39.709
trying to make them
feel welcome.

01:15:41.275 --> 01:15:43.451
I like that I don't have
to do that with you.

01:15:46.063 --> 01:15:48.674
I have to be nice all the time,

01:15:50.284 --> 01:15:51.851
but I'd rather be honest.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.639
You might not be
the nicest person,

01:15:58.205 --> 01:15:59.467
but I can tell...

01:16:03.254 --> 01:16:04.864
you're the most honest.

01:17:26.859 --> 01:17:29.079
<i>She stood there
looking at me for a long time,</i>

01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:31.995
<i>charged, changed,</i>

01:17:33.779 --> 01:17:37.174
<i>as if I'd shown her something
she hadn't quite been
prepared for.</i>

01:17:42.005 --> 01:17:44.703
<i>As far as I'm aware,
she went straight home.</i>

01:17:51.884 --> 01:17:54.887
Jesus. You startled me.

01:17:55.018 --> 01:17:56.672
Oh, did I? I didn't mean to.

01:17:58.108 --> 01:18:00.066
<i>I wondered whether
I should say anything</i>

01:18:00.197 --> 01:18:02.590
<i>about the events in the room
the previous evening...</i>

01:18:02.721 --> 01:18:04.462
- Early.
- Yeah.

01:18:04.592 --> 01:18:05.898
<i>...but decided
that it would be best</i>

01:18:06.029 --> 01:18:07.595
<i>to simply ride
the wave of impressions</i>

01:18:07.726 --> 01:18:08.814
<i>I had been given.</i>

01:18:08.945 --> 01:18:10.990
<i>Eventually, I said...</i>

01:18:11.121 --> 01:18:12.688
You too, huh?

01:18:15.908 --> 01:18:18.258
- Uh, legal department?
- Oh, yes. You can take
the elevator...

01:18:18.389 --> 01:18:20.478
<i>I could see
she didn't know
how to broach the topic</i>

01:18:20.608 --> 01:18:22.741
<i>of our life-altering encounter.</i>

01:18:22.872 --> 01:18:25.526
<i>I decided to give her a moment
to gather her thoughts.</i>

01:18:31.184 --> 01:18:33.796
-  Got it, thank you.
-  Alyssa.

01:18:33.926 --> 01:18:35.362
- Hi. Um...
- How can I help you?

01:18:35.493 --> 01:18:37.930
Can I, uh, borrow a quarter
for the coffee machine?

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.631
I have an appointment
with Mr. Goring.

01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:46.852
J-Just-- just one quarter.

01:18:46.983 --> 01:18:48.636
Just a quarter
for the coffee machine.

01:18:48.767 --> 01:18:50.203
Yes, one sec.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:54.555
All right, you can have a seat
right over there.

01:18:54.686 --> 01:18:57.036
- I'll let him know you're here.
- Thank you.

01:18:58.124 --> 01:19:01.693
Hello. Yes, Meredith is here
to see you, Mr. Goring.

01:19:02.563 --> 01:19:03.739
Yes, thank you.

01:19:06.132 --> 01:19:08.352
<i>I decided to counter
her irritation</i>

01:19:08.482 --> 01:19:10.615
<i>with a forgiving,
worldly attitude.</i>

01:19:12.225 --> 01:19:13.400
"Money isn't everything."

01:19:27.066 --> 01:19:30.461
Mm. You know,
I actually think
the coffee's better down here.

01:19:33.943 --> 01:19:36.467
I have to ask you something
personal. Is that okay?

01:19:40.036 --> 01:19:40.906
Yeah.

01:19:42.299 --> 01:19:43.387
Last night...

01:19:45.432 --> 01:19:47.086
were you on drugs?

01:19:49.915 --> 01:19:51.482
<i>Why would she ask me that?</i>

01:19:52.265 --> 01:19:53.484
<i>Was she a drug user?</i>

01:19:55.007 --> 01:19:55.965
<i>What a shame.</i>

01:19:56.748 --> 01:19:57.967
<i>I really liked her.</i>

01:19:59.098 --> 01:20:01.057
<i>I felt my whole body ache.</i>

01:20:02.058 --> 01:20:04.103
What do you-- what do you mean?

01:20:07.063 --> 01:20:08.368
I-- I just mean...

01:20:09.674 --> 01:20:10.544
Well...

01:20:12.895 --> 01:20:15.419
what are you doing
down here now, for instance?

01:20:16.159 --> 01:20:17.290
It's work time.

01:20:24.602 --> 01:20:26.473
<i>Without knowing how
it had happened...</i>

01:20:26.604 --> 01:20:27.953
-  Oh!

01:20:28.084 --> 01:20:30.477
<i>...I felt something warm
and wet on my legs.</i>

01:20:31.739 --> 01:20:33.567
<i>I'd walked straight
into the trap.</i>

01:20:34.481 --> 01:20:37.397
<i>All that smiling,
that optimistic outlook,</i>

01:20:38.268 --> 01:20:40.836
<i>clearly, it was
a chemically-produced
friendliness.</i>

01:20:40.966 --> 01:20:42.620
You can head right on up.

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:45.405
<i>Being taken in by the surface
appearance of a drug user</i>

01:20:45.536 --> 01:20:48.713
<i>was one of the dangers
of being an open,
honest person.</i>

01:21:01.726 --> 01:21:04.076
<i>Something about the room
didn't make sense,</i>

01:21:05.034 --> 01:21:06.992
<i>so I figured I may
as well investigate.</i>

01:21:12.432 --> 01:21:13.346
Hello!

01:21:14.782 --> 01:21:16.741
<i>I went down to the third floor.</i>

01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:28.144
<i>The layout was the same,
but no room.</i>

01:21:43.463 --> 01:21:45.726
<i>I was forced to admire
the elegant artistry</i>

01:21:45.857 --> 01:21:48.468
<i>of whoever had constructed
the secret space.</i>

01:21:48.599 --> 01:21:51.558
<i>What had the architect done
to conceal a room</i>

01:21:51.689 --> 01:21:55.040
<i>when it was right
in front of the noses
of everyone working here.</i>

01:21:57.869 --> 01:22:00.393
I know you've only
ever done four,

01:22:00.524 --> 01:22:03.309
or the occasional
three-figure cases, but...

01:22:04.615 --> 01:22:09.141
how would you feel
about taking on number 97?

01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:13.667
It's a direct request
from the EVP.

01:22:16.453 --> 01:22:17.454
I'd be happy to.

01:22:18.542 --> 01:22:21.327
Your first double-digit case.

01:22:22.285 --> 01:22:24.461
Come on. I'll help you
pick out the material.

01:22:28.465 --> 01:22:30.075
<i>As Andrew
walked next to me</i>

01:22:30.206 --> 01:22:31.555
<i>along the halls
of the fifth floor</i>

01:22:31.685 --> 01:22:33.513
<i>with the heavy burden
in his arms,</i>

01:22:33.644 --> 01:22:35.167
<i>it felt like
he was my assistant.</i>

01:22:35.298 --> 01:22:38.866
Orson, we should've
brought a cart.

01:22:38.997 --> 01:22:41.043
<i>He had started to rely on me.</i>

01:22:48.354 --> 01:22:50.574
<i>As the days passed,
I grew irritated,</i>

01:22:50.704 --> 01:22:53.620
<i>having to keep quiet
about my real workplace.</i>

01:22:53.751 --> 01:22:56.014
<i>Besides, I was tired
of having to wait</i>

01:22:56.145 --> 01:22:57.885
<i>until all the others
had left each day</i>

01:22:58.016 --> 01:22:59.626
<i>before I could get
anything done.</i>

01:23:04.196 --> 01:23:06.894
<i>I was thinking about it
as I passed Alyssa
in reception,</i>

01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:08.722
<i>who hadn't looked at me
for several days now,</i>

01:23:08.853 --> 01:23:11.203
<i>and thus, hadn't given me
an appropriate opportunity</i>

01:23:11.334 --> 01:23:13.814
<i>to show that I was keeping
my distance.</i>

01:23:16.687 --> 01:23:19.995
I've taken the liberty
of purchasing,
at company expense,

01:23:21.692 --> 01:23:22.954
a small gift...

01:23:29.874 --> 01:23:32.529
to emphasize how you've adjusted
to the new protocols

01:23:32.659 --> 01:23:34.531
and to show how proud
I am of you.

01:23:34.661 --> 01:23:37.925
Thank you very much, Andrew.
I appreciate the gesture,

01:23:38.056 --> 01:23:42.017
uh, but there's something
more important to discuss.

01:23:43.888 --> 01:23:45.542
Uh...

01:23:45.672 --> 01:23:48.197
Obviously, I'm not making
any kind of demand,

01:23:49.154 --> 01:23:50.155
but, uh...

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:55.421
you would be making it easier
for me to choose you here

01:23:56.248 --> 01:24:00.774
if there were ever any chance
of me considering anything else.

01:24:01.471 --> 01:24:03.125
Are you thinking of leaving us?

01:24:04.213 --> 01:24:05.649
I can't get into that.

01:24:05.779 --> 01:24:07.042
Hmm...

01:24:08.913 --> 01:24:10.349
What would you like
to talk about?

01:24:11.829 --> 01:24:14.310
Well, I don't wanna mention
anyone by name, but...

01:24:16.268 --> 01:24:19.271
I could think of at least
one person at the company

01:24:19.402 --> 01:24:21.056
who is a drug user.

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:27.671
But that's not my main concern.

01:24:30.674 --> 01:24:33.024
I think we can take for granted
that of everyone here,

01:24:33.155 --> 01:24:37.594
I contribute the most
in terms of work,

01:24:39.161 --> 01:24:43.513
and I find it reasonable
that I should have
a space of my own,

01:24:43.643 --> 01:24:48.126
an office, if you will,
in which to do that work.

01:24:50.476 --> 01:24:52.348
I would like to propose that...

01:24:54.306 --> 01:24:58.571
the room is a place
I could work.

01:25:01.487 --> 01:25:04.186
- You mean "the room"?
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:04.316 --> 01:25:05.883
No. No, no, no, no, no.

01:25:06.013 --> 01:25:07.406
I thought we were done
with that.

01:25:07.537 --> 01:25:09.321
Well, not exactly.

01:25:10.627 --> 01:25:13.673
Okay, it is very important
that we do the right thing
in a situation like this.

01:25:13.804 --> 01:25:15.240
It's important
for the whole company.

01:25:15.371 --> 01:25:17.155
We're not going to make
any hasty decisions.

01:25:17.286 --> 01:25:20.289
Well, obviously, I can't decide
what happens to anyone else...

01:25:20.419 --> 01:25:22.204
- No, exactly.
- ...apart from myself.

01:25:22.334 --> 01:25:28.253
So just give me
free access to the room.

01:25:30.473 --> 01:25:32.257
<i>I could understand
where he was coming from.</i>

01:25:32.388 --> 01:25:35.304
<i>Creative people have always
encountered resistance.</i>

01:25:35.434 --> 01:25:38.437
<i>It's perfectly natural for more
straightforward individuals</i>

01:25:38.568 --> 01:25:40.874
<i>to feel alarmed
by someone of talent.</i>

01:25:42.093 --> 01:25:43.964
<i>But I was done playing nice.</i>

01:25:49.666 --> 01:25:51.276
Thank you for the slippers.

01:25:56.412 --> 01:25:57.891
Maybe we've
reached the point now

01:25:58.022 --> 01:26:00.242
where the room
has a certain significance,

01:26:00.372 --> 01:26:02.722
and on those terms, then,
it does exist.

01:26:02.853 --> 01:26:04.768
How crazy do I have
to be to get the free slippers?

01:26:16.258 --> 01:26:17.259
What's going on?

01:26:19.739 --> 01:26:21.306
Andrew went upstairs
to the EVP.

01:26:23.787 --> 01:26:24.788
What for?

01:26:26.006 --> 01:26:27.182
Well, he's gonna ask him.

01:26:28.618 --> 01:26:29.662
About what?

01:26:31.795 --> 01:26:34.406
About the room.
That's what we agreed.

01:26:34.537 --> 01:26:36.756
This is a matter
for the executive
vice president.

01:26:38.454 --> 01:26:40.107
That's probably right.

01:26:40.238 --> 01:26:43.502
What exactly is it
that you want?

01:26:43.633 --> 01:26:45.287
I just want to do my job.

01:26:46.113 --> 01:26:47.941
What do you think we're doing?

01:26:48.072 --> 01:26:51.206
I can't say
with total certainty.

01:26:52.903 --> 01:26:57.255
Now, this is such a grandiose
and detailed project...

01:26:59.475 --> 01:27:01.651
...and it's so
ingeniously malicious.

01:27:01.781 --> 01:27:04.349
I have to admit,
I'm kinda fascinated by it.

01:27:07.613 --> 01:27:09.572
But it will be exciting to see
what the EVP says

01:27:09.702 --> 01:27:11.182
when Andrew comes back down.

01:27:13.967 --> 01:27:14.881
Yeah.

01:27:16.318 --> 01:27:19.886
<i>And with that, I put on my coat
and went off to lunch early.</i>

01:27:47.479 --> 01:27:50.526
Orson! They asked me to grab you
the second you came in.

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:55.052
Andrew needs to see you
in his office.

01:27:55.182 --> 01:27:57.272
He said you could go right in
and wait for him.

01:28:03.974 --> 01:28:07.282
<i>Any minute,
Andrew would be here
begging for my forgiveness,</i>

01:28:07.412 --> 01:28:10.285
<i>and with, I hope,
some reasonable explanation</i>

01:28:10.415 --> 01:28:12.025
<i>for what's really
been going on.</i>

01:28:14.027 --> 01:28:17.857
<i>I would admit to him
I have made use of the room
for all manner of activities.</i>

01:28:18.684 --> 01:28:22.427
<i>I have done most of my--
and he will have to forgive me
for putting it like this--</i>

01:28:22.558 --> 01:28:24.473
<i>"singularly-successful"
work in there</i>

01:28:24.603 --> 01:28:26.997
<i>during the evenings
and at night.</i>

01:28:27.127 --> 01:28:29.521
<i>And, yes, I intend
to keep on doing so.</i>

01:28:33.612 --> 01:28:36.136
<i>But Andrew's betrayals
would not be forgiven.</i>

01:28:36.876 --> 01:28:39.662
<i>I would only stay
on the condition that he goes.</i>

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:53.676
<i>Five, six, maybe seven minutes
of intense silence passed.</i>

01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:28.624
Hello, Orson.

01:29:28.754 --> 01:29:30.626
I've come straight from the EVP.

01:29:30.756 --> 01:29:31.844
<i>Finally.</i>

01:29:33.498 --> 01:29:36.283
We, uh... we spent
a long time talking.

01:29:37.328 --> 01:29:38.721
So, um...

01:29:38.851 --> 01:29:42.028
Well, I informed him
about everything, about you,

01:29:42.768 --> 01:29:45.162
and your extraordinary accomplishments,

01:29:45.292 --> 01:29:47.599
your peculiar way of working,

01:29:47.730 --> 01:29:49.862
and your request for the, uh...

01:29:51.864 --> 01:29:52.865
the room.

01:29:57.479 --> 01:30:00.090
He very seriously
considered the situation.

01:30:01.613 --> 01:30:02.658
He showed me

01:30:03.963 --> 01:30:05.356
the floor plans.

01:30:05.487 --> 01:30:07.750
Orson, we looked
at them together.

01:30:08.577 --> 01:30:10.405
He was in no doubt, very...

01:30:11.275 --> 01:30:12.319
How can I put it...

01:30:12.450 --> 01:30:14.800
Persuasive in his argument.

01:30:18.369 --> 01:30:23.548
On this, the fourth floor,
between the elevators
and the bathrooms,

01:30:23.679 --> 01:30:30.294
there is absolutely
no other space.

01:30:38.781 --> 01:30:42.480
And I'm sorry, Orson,
but his decision is final.

01:30:44.482 --> 01:30:45.570
I have to let you go.

01:30:49.356 --> 01:30:52.577
- <i>Andrew was threatened by me.</i>
- Come on.

01:30:52.708 --> 01:30:55.188
<i>He'd set out to hire
an invalid, a drone</i>

01:30:55.319 --> 01:30:58.104
<i>who could never approach
his modest level of competence.</i>

01:30:58.235 --> 01:30:59.541
Let's clear out your desk.

01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:03.283
<i>When he realized
I was more capable than he was,</i>

01:31:03.414 --> 01:31:05.416
<i>I naturally became his enemy.</i>

01:31:12.945 --> 01:31:15.295
You're making
a terrible mistake.

01:31:36.534 --> 01:31:39.624
I am sorry, Orson.
I did try to warn you.

01:31:47.589 --> 01:31:49.634
Please, Andrew,
I don't blame you.

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:52.637
You know, little people
can't be held accountable

01:31:52.768 --> 01:31:55.945
for striving to undermine
their betters.

01:31:57.990 --> 01:32:00.863
But you people, you all
should be very, very proud.

01:32:00.993 --> 01:32:02.125
I'm impressed.

01:32:02.865 --> 01:32:04.388
You wanna tell me
how far in advance

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:06.085
all of this got, uh,
got worked out?

01:32:06.216 --> 01:32:07.609
Was-- was it before
I even arrived?

01:32:07.739 --> 01:32:10.568
Was I even one of the original
intended victims?

01:32:11.743 --> 01:32:12.918
Huh?

01:32:14.616 --> 01:32:16.008
I mean, you can tell me,
you won.

01:32:17.706 --> 01:32:18.750
No?

01:32:18.881 --> 01:32:19.882
No one?

01:32:22.667 --> 01:32:24.060
Fine, have it your way.

01:32:24.190 --> 01:32:25.888
You can go back
to your sagging trolleys

01:32:26.018 --> 01:32:27.716
of imprecise wording,

01:32:27.846 --> 01:32:30.849
and your banal,
meteorological obsessions,

01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:34.636
- and your absurd rituals.

01:32:34.766 --> 01:32:37.595
And because, because,
because-- because the EVPs,

01:32:37.726 --> 01:32:41.120
and then the CEOs,
and the-- and the VIPs,
and all the other acronyms

01:32:41.251 --> 01:32:43.993
are gonna-- are gonna go on
with their collateralized debts,

01:32:44.123 --> 01:32:45.951
and their short stocks,
and their long options,

01:32:46.082 --> 01:32:47.910
and you can't even see it.

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.956
- You can't even see it!
-  Orson...

01:32:53.306 --> 01:32:54.612
They don't care about you.

01:32:57.572 --> 01:33:00.575
They don't. You're,
you're-- you're a number
in a column on a spreadsheet.

01:33:02.315 --> 01:33:04.230
This is a corral
and you're all livestock,

01:33:04.361 --> 01:33:05.971
but instead of slaughtering you,

01:33:06.102 --> 01:33:08.191
they just show you
the efficiency metrics

01:33:08.321 --> 01:33:10.585
and then encourage you
to slit your own throat.

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:15.720
And you? You...

01:33:15.851 --> 01:33:17.374
If you think you're gonna get
the same kind of work

01:33:17.504 --> 01:33:19.637
you got out of me
out of these-- these people

01:33:19.768 --> 01:33:21.378
that can't even see a door
right in front of their face,

01:33:21.508 --> 01:33:23.075
then you got
another thing coming.

01:33:32.519 --> 01:33:34.434
That's impossible, by the way.

01:33:50.973 --> 01:33:54.890
<i>It's easy to let
yourself be taken in
by new acquaintances.</i>

01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:57.196
<i>You ascribe to them
all manner of noble qualities,</i>

01:33:57.327 --> 01:33:58.850
<i>simply because you don't
know them well enough.</i>

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:03.289
<i>But you will almost always
end up disappointed.</i>

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:07.598
<i>Sooner or later, you always
reach a certain point,</i>

01:34:07.729 --> 01:34:12.559
<i>an occasion where their
true self breaks through.</i>

01:34:12.690 --> 01:34:16.868
<i>One way of dealing with that
is simply to assume
the worst of people.</i>

01:34:42.981 --> 01:34:46.332
<i>It's good to realize
that we aren't as remarkable
as we might imagine.</i>

01:34:47.769 --> 01:34:51.598
<i>We wanna make a lot of money,
eat good food,</i>

01:34:51.729 --> 01:34:53.557
<i>and generally have a nice time.</i>

01:34:55.254 --> 01:34:57.648
<i>We are all relatively
simple creatures.</i>

01:34:59.302 --> 01:35:02.435
<i>Deep down, we just want
peace and quiet.</i>

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:11.096
<i>The problem
with ordinary people</i>

01:35:11.227 --> 01:35:13.925
<i>is they don't see the world
as it really is.</i>

01:35:14.056 --> 01:35:17.363
<i>They don't see the nuances,
the little differences.</i>

01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:21.585
<i>You have to show
people like that</i>

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:23.108
<i>what their shortcomings are.</i>

01:35:45.304 --> 01:35:46.479
Stop!

01:36:07.065 --> 01:36:08.066
Follow him!

01:36:46.757 --> 01:36:48.977
- Orson?
- Orson?

01:36:49.107 --> 01:36:51.370
<i>Finally, I could breathe again,</i>

01:36:51.501 --> 01:36:53.808
<i>and think more or less clearly.</i>

01:36:56.419 --> 01:36:57.812
Orson?

01:36:57.942 --> 01:36:58.943
Orson?

01:36:59.074 --> 01:37:00.379
- Orson?

01:37:29.147 --> 01:37:30.757
<i>It smelled like the sea...</i>

01:37:31.889 --> 01:37:33.064
<i>and lilacs...</i>

01:37:34.065 --> 01:37:36.938
<i>and Lindenwood Park
at five in the morning
at the end of May.</i>

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.599
<i>You'll never find me here.</i>
