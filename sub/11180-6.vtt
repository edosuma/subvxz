WEBVTT

00:01.587 --> 00:04.245
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.383 --> 00:07.248
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.386 --> 00:11.114
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:12.081 --> 00:14.704
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.842 --> 00:17.845
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.983 --> 00:21.504
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.402 --> 00:26.060
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.198 --> 00:28.752
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.890 --> 00:31.203
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.341 --> 00:33.999
Just to get up that hill

00:34.137 --> 00:36.588
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.726 --> 00:39.073
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.211 --> 00:41.696
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.834 --> 00:43.595
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.733 --> 00:46.184
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.322 --> 00:49.221
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.359 --> 00:52.604
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.846 --> 00:56.642
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.780 --> 00:59.611
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.749 --> 01:03.339
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:33.334 --> 01:34.680
Florence, are you busy?

01:34.818 --> 01:37.131
Sure. I'm busy resting.

01:37.269 --> 01:39.202
Do you mind helping
me with my French lesson?

01:39.340 --> 01:40.376
It beats working.

01:41.480 --> 01:44.069
You read me the English
and I'll say it in French.

01:44.207 --> 01:46.313
All right. How are you?

01:46.451 --> 01:47.555
Comment allez-vous?

01:47.693 --> 01:50.282
That's wrong.
It's "coment alice-vows."

01:55.908 --> 01:57.289
No. I was right.

01:57.427 --> 02:00.050
The French write words
differently than the way
they say them.

02:00.189 --> 02:02.052
I did the same
thing in school.

02:02.191 --> 02:04.158
Only they called
it bad spelling.

02:06.022 --> 02:07.817
Read me the next one.

02:07.955 --> 02:10.889
How come you're so
interested in learning
French all of a sudden?

02:11.027 --> 02:12.753
Well, with you working
here full time,

02:12.891 --> 02:14.341
there's not enough
for me to do.

02:14.479 --> 02:15.997
So, rather than go crazy,

02:16.136 --> 02:18.793
I decided to take
up something.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.900
Well, why don't you
take up cleaning?
Then you could help me.

02:24.627 --> 02:26.353
Read the next question.

02:26.491 --> 02:27.871
Oui, oui, mademoiselle.

02:28.907 --> 02:30.529
I'm not a mademoiselle.

02:30.667 --> 02:32.462
I'm a madame.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.016
Well, I sure hope
Mr. Jefferson
don't find that out.

02:36.604 --> 02:38.986
I'd hate to spoil
that good mood he's been in.

02:39.124 --> 02:40.643
What's gotten into him?

02:40.781 --> 02:43.266
Well, I think he's got some
big deal cooking.

02:43.404 --> 02:46.304
But he won't tell
me what it is.
He wants to surprise me.

02:47.650 --> 02:50.066
Oh, I'll get that,
Florence...
Oh, thank you.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.068
While you do the
bedroom closets.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.863
I knew there was
a catch to it.

02:56.969 --> 02:59.593
You sure you don't want
me to help you do the door?

02:59.731 --> 03:01.319
The closets, Florence.

03:01.457 --> 03:02.492
Yes, ma'am!

03:05.185 --> 03:07.773
Hi, Ben.
Hello, Louise!

03:07.911 --> 03:09.741
George forgot the
cleaning again,

03:09.879 --> 03:11.777
so I thought I'd bring
'em up to you.

03:11.915 --> 03:13.986
Oh, Ben, you shouldn't
have to deliver...

03:14.124 --> 03:16.782
Hey, I'm the manager
of the store.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.784
I can send whoever I want to,

03:18.922 --> 03:20.993
so, I sent me.

03:21.131 --> 03:24.687
Because you know I
wouldn't let you leave
without a cup of coffee.

03:24.825 --> 03:26.896
You saw right through me.

03:27.034 --> 03:28.932
Well, come in!

03:29.070 --> 03:30.140
Florence!

03:30.279 --> 03:32.867
You sure it's no trouble?
For you, never.

03:33.454 --> 03:34.421
Hi, Ben.

03:34.559 --> 03:36.146
Hi, Florence.
How're you doing?

03:36.285 --> 03:38.252
I'm doing too much, as usual.

03:40.496 --> 03:42.601
Uh, would you bring
us some coffee, please?

03:42.739 --> 03:43.913
Good idea.

03:44.051 --> 03:46.018
It's about time I had
a coffee break.

03:47.606 --> 03:50.091
And don't forget the
cream and sugar,
s'il vous plait.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.578
We got the cream and sugar,
but I think we're all
out of "see voo play!"

03:54.544 --> 03:56.926
Say, when did you
start talking French?

03:57.064 --> 03:59.031
Well, I've been taking
French lessons

03:59.169 --> 04:00.999
for when George
and I go to Paris.

04:01.137 --> 04:05.659
Uh, that's funny.
George never told me
anything about going there.

04:05.797 --> 04:08.869
That's because I haven't
told him yet.

04:09.007 --> 04:12.700
That's a lot of flying
and sightseeing
to cram into one day.

04:13.563 --> 04:15.116
One day?

04:15.255 --> 04:17.809
Well, you'll never get
George to take off
more than a Sunday.

04:17.947 --> 04:21.157
He loves working better than
anybody I ever knew.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.849
And I wonder who he
learned that from.

04:23.987 --> 04:26.852
Did you know that Ben gave
George his first job?
Ah.

04:26.990 --> 04:28.647
Anybody can make a mistake.

04:38.243 --> 04:40.210
How long have you
known Mr. Jefferson?

04:41.384 --> 04:44.007
Well, let's see.
I'm over 60 now.

04:44.145 --> 04:46.907
Must be more than 30 years
I've known George.

04:47.045 --> 04:49.910
Well, he was no more than 16.

04:50.048 --> 04:53.016
I was working in this
cleaning store in Harlem, see,

04:53.154 --> 04:55.605
and one day George
come running in there

04:55.743 --> 04:59.299
with two big bad dudes
chasing after him.

04:59.437 --> 05:00.679
What a sight!

05:00.817 --> 05:04.614
Two big sledgehammers
after one little toothpick!

05:07.065 --> 05:08.963
Now, I wish I
could've seen that.

05:09.101 --> 05:12.346
I don't mind telling
you I was scared.

05:12.484 --> 05:13.796
And then what happened?

05:13.934 --> 05:17.627
Well, first thing George did
was run behind the counter

05:17.765 --> 05:19.457
and grab hold of my hand.

05:19.595 --> 05:21.286
And then he yelled,

05:21.424 --> 05:24.945
"Come one more step and my dad
will cave your head in!"

05:25.083 --> 05:26.360
Then he looked at me.

05:26.498 --> 05:28.673
My soul nearly left my body.

05:31.158 --> 05:34.230
Well, I couldn't help
liking that little kid.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.957
It was something about
the way he stood there

05:37.095 --> 05:38.890
that gave me some spine,

05:39.028 --> 05:41.824
and before I knew it,
it was us against them.

05:41.962 --> 05:43.515
And what a battle!

05:43.653 --> 05:46.138
Mr. Jefferson sure was lucky
to have you on his side.

05:46.276 --> 05:49.038
No, he wasn't,
'cause they beat the hell
out of both of us.

05:54.871 --> 05:57.046
By the time I got myself up,

05:57.633 --> 05:58.979
I said, "Son,

05:59.117 --> 06:02.603
"the next time you get in
trouble, don't come in here."

06:02.741 --> 06:04.260
And George said,

06:04.398 --> 06:07.677
"Don't worry. The next time
I get myself trouble,

06:07.815 --> 06:10.231
"I'm gonna find somebody
who can fight."

06:11.750 --> 06:14.063
And you still hired
him after all that?

06:14.201 --> 06:17.929
Well, I felt sorry for him.

06:18.067 --> 06:22.209
His father was dead, he'd quit
school so he could find work.

06:22.347 --> 06:25.557
So I talked the owner
into letting me hire him.

06:25.695 --> 06:27.490
You know, Ben,
if it wasn't for you,

06:27.628 --> 06:29.596
George wouldn't be
where he is today.

06:29.734 --> 06:31.425
Oh, sure he would.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.705
Weezy, I got me
some big news.

06:36.119 --> 06:37.638
I mean big news!

06:37.776 --> 06:41.193
I mean, big, big, big, big!

06:43.023 --> 06:45.577
Ben, I'm glad you're here.
You can help us celebrate it.

06:45.715 --> 06:46.682
What about me?

06:46.820 --> 06:48.960
You can help, too.
Get some glasses for us.

06:51.756 --> 06:52.964
What's the big news?

06:53.102 --> 06:54.206
I'm selling out!

06:54.344 --> 06:55.415
LOUISE: You're what?

06:55.553 --> 06:56.761
I'm selling out
all my stores!

06:56.899 --> 06:58.935
You ever hear of
Allco Enterprises?
No.

06:59.073 --> 07:02.491
Well, Allco Enterprises
owns everything from
bowling alleys to restaurants.

07:02.629 --> 07:04.493
They're what you call
a conglomerate.

07:04.631 --> 07:07.875
That's 'cause they
"glom" onto anything
they can get their hands on.

07:09.290 --> 07:10.430
And?

07:10.568 --> 07:12.190
And they're buying
out all my stores!

07:12.328 --> 07:13.743
Paying me cash for
the stores,

07:13.881 --> 07:16.056
plus they're paying me
a big salary to stay
on and manage them.

07:16.194 --> 07:17.678
What do you think of that?

07:17.816 --> 07:19.611
Well, I...
Florence! I thought I told you
to get some glasses!

07:19.749 --> 07:20.992
Uh, wait, Florence.

07:21.751 --> 07:24.409
George, you're your
own boss now.

07:24.547 --> 07:26.376
You may not like working
for someone else.

07:26.515 --> 07:27.999
Maybe you're moving
too quickly.

07:28.137 --> 07:29.897
And I'll tell you something
else that I'm getting.

07:30.035 --> 07:32.313
A regular paid vacation,
four weeks a year.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.489
Well, what are
you waiting for?

07:35.627 --> 07:37.180
Grab it!

07:37.318 --> 07:40.563
You heard Mr. Jefferson!
Get some glasses! And fast!
Yes, ma'am!

07:41.219 --> 07:42.462
George, I'm so happy.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.878
Will you take me to France
on our first vacation?

07:45.016 --> 07:46.086
You got it.

07:46.224 --> 07:47.536
When can we leave?

07:47.674 --> 07:49.054
Uh, next Friday.

07:49.192 --> 07:51.781
Next Friday?
That's wonderful!

07:51.919 --> 07:54.025
You make all the arrangements.
Get a new set of luggage.

07:54.163 --> 07:55.578
And we'll fly out of
here Friday night

07:55.716 --> 07:58.443
and we won't have to come
back till Monday morning.

08:03.655 --> 08:05.415
Monday morning?

08:05.554 --> 08:08.039
Oh, yeah. That's right, Weezy.
I'll need a good
night's sleep.

08:08.177 --> 08:09.489
Make that Sunday night.

08:11.076 --> 08:13.838
Well, what happened
to the four weeks' vacation?

08:13.976 --> 08:16.772
Allco Enterprises is
making me a vice president.

08:16.910 --> 08:20.016
As a big executive, I gotta
work harder than anybody else.

08:20.154 --> 08:23.261
Then what's the big deal
about this big deal?

08:23.399 --> 08:25.781
Weren't you listening? They're
gonna give me a lot of money.

08:25.919 --> 08:27.714
But we've got enough now.

08:27.852 --> 08:30.268
They're also taking
all the worries off my hands.

08:30.406 --> 08:31.787
How?

08:31.925 --> 08:34.099
Well, if a machine breaks
down, they got to
take care of it.

08:34.237 --> 08:36.274
See, they're taking care
of all my headaches.

08:36.412 --> 08:37.344
Here you are!

08:37.482 --> 08:39.208
Well, most of my headaches.

08:40.934 --> 08:42.418
I gotta hand it to
you, George.

08:42.556 --> 08:45.145
You sure got a good
head for business.

08:45.283 --> 08:47.216
Yeah, I couldn't've done
it without you, Ben.

08:47.354 --> 08:49.598
And I surely couldn't have
done it without you, Weezy.

08:49.736 --> 08:51.047
Ha-ha.

08:51.185 --> 08:54.672
Behind every successful man
there stands a good woman.

08:54.810 --> 08:57.467
Oh, that's the nicest thing
you ever said about me.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.887
George, here's to
your success!

09:03.025 --> 09:07.201
You earned all the good things
that's gonna happen to you.

09:07.339 --> 09:10.066
I'm not the only one
good things are gonna
happening to, Ben.

09:10.204 --> 09:12.828
You and all my workers are
gonna get lots of benefits

09:12.966 --> 09:16.901
including medical insurance,
cost of living raises and
paid vacations.

09:17.039 --> 09:19.041
You got to be jiving!

09:19.179 --> 09:21.491
No, I ain't! It says so
right here in the
company rules book.

09:21.630 --> 09:22.631
Look for yourself.

09:22.769 --> 09:24.529
No, no. I'll take
your word for it.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.496
Let me see that.
For what?

09:26.635 --> 09:29.810
Now that you're
a big executive, I'd
like a few benefits too.

09:29.948 --> 09:32.502
There must be some in here
I ain't never thought of!

09:32.641 --> 09:35.782
Well, I better grab some
lunch and get back to work.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.267
Wait a minute, Ben. You're
gonna have lunch right here

09:38.405 --> 09:39.786
in the executive kitchen.

09:39.924 --> 09:40.994
Florence, get us some lunch.

09:41.132 --> 09:42.789
Mm-hmm. What'll it be?

09:42.927 --> 09:44.929
Well, something befitting
the vice president

09:45.067 --> 09:47.552
of Allco Enterprises
Dry Cleaning Division

09:47.690 --> 09:49.589
and his new administrative
assistant!

09:51.970 --> 09:53.938
Two bologna sandwiches,
coming up!

09:58.183 --> 09:59.702
Have some more
champagne, Ben.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.222
Well, I don't know...
Go on, go on.

10:02.360 --> 10:05.363
It comes under
executive expense.
I'll write it off my taxes.

10:05.501 --> 10:07.883
Yeah. And you're gonna
have plenty of those.

10:08.021 --> 10:09.988
So what? I'll just get me
a good tax shelter.

10:10.126 --> 10:12.404
What's a tax shelter?

10:12.542 --> 10:15.200
It's like welfare,
only it's for the rich.

10:22.276 --> 10:26.039
Ben, I'm putting you
in charge of a lot of
things from here on in.

10:26.177 --> 10:28.351
Mr. Jefferson, can I
see you a minute?

10:28.489 --> 10:30.215
Soon as you finish making
our lunch, you can.

10:30.353 --> 10:32.908
I think you'll want to
hear this, Mr. Jefferson.

10:33.046 --> 10:35.082
Didn't you say he
was over 60?

10:35.220 --> 10:36.808
Yeah. I'm 63. Why?

10:36.946 --> 10:39.949
'Cause I just found another
benefit you're gonna get
from Mr. Jefferson.

10:40.087 --> 10:41.157
Oh, yeah. What's that?

10:41.295 --> 10:42.538
He's gonna fire you!

10:42.918 --> 10:43.884
What?

10:53.204 --> 10:54.999
Florence, what are
you talking about?

10:55.137 --> 10:58.519
It says here when an
employee reaches 60,

10:58.658 --> 11:00.107
he gets the ax.

11:01.039 --> 11:02.869
You're gonna have to fire me?

11:03.007 --> 11:05.388
No! I read this book.
I don't remember seeing that.

11:05.526 --> 11:06.735
It's right there!

11:08.046 --> 11:10.186
Oh! See, that's how
dumb you are.

11:10.324 --> 11:13.155
It don't say nothing
about being axed.
It says terminated.

11:17.297 --> 11:19.644
Well, they ain't gonna ax me.

11:19.782 --> 11:21.577
They're gonna kill me.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.028
Hold on! Hold on!

11:24.166 --> 11:26.271
Now everybody, just relax.

11:26.409 --> 11:29.516
Now, ain't nobody going to
be axed, fired or terminated.

11:29.654 --> 11:31.311
But it says in the
book right there...

11:31.449 --> 11:33.831
Now look, George Jefferson
don't go by no book.

11:33.969 --> 11:35.591
All I got to do is pick
up the phone,

11:35.729 --> 11:38.145
call the executive vice
president and tell him,

11:38.283 --> 11:40.182
"Look, you can't fire
my main man."

11:40.320 --> 11:42.253
Me and the V.P.
are just like that.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.117
Thanks, George!

11:44.255 --> 11:46.844
Ain't that boy something?

11:46.982 --> 11:49.363
He's gonna straighten
out them big wheels.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.469
It's the least he can do.

11:51.607 --> 11:54.265
Hello, Mr. Sparks, please.
George Jefferson speaking.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.027
Hello, Mr. Sparks?

11:58.165 --> 11:59.235
What?

11:59.373 --> 12:01.721
Oh, oh, okay. Jim!

12:02.342 --> 12:03.584
Jim! This is George.

12:04.171 --> 12:05.517
How you doin'?

12:05.655 --> 12:07.692
Well, look, Jim, we've got
ourselves a problem down here.

12:07.830 --> 12:09.694
Oh, no. It's got nothing
to do with the deal.

12:09.832 --> 12:11.661
Well, see one
of my employees, uh.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.664
Well, he's over 60 and,
yeah, I know what
the rulebook says.

12:14.803 --> 12:16.563
But see,
Ben is my right hand man.

12:16.701 --> 12:20.118
And I know Allco don't want me
to chop off my right hand!

12:20.256 --> 12:22.086
George is laying it on him!

12:23.294 --> 12:24.467
Sure, I know that.

12:24.605 --> 12:25.606
Uh-huh.

12:26.228 --> 12:27.470
Uh-huh.

12:29.058 --> 12:30.025
Uh-huh.

12:32.027 --> 12:33.131
Uh-huh.

12:35.444 --> 12:36.445
Bye.

12:42.416 --> 12:44.764
I didn't like the sound
of all them "uh-huh's."

12:46.248 --> 12:48.837
A lot of uh-huh's
usually means uh-oh!

12:50.700 --> 12:52.944
Well, what did he say?
Is Ben gonna get fired?

12:54.118 --> 12:55.809
No, he ain't.

12:55.947 --> 12:57.673
Oh, that's wonderful!

12:57.811 --> 12:58.916
Thanks, George.

12:59.054 --> 13:00.538
He's gonna be retired!

13:02.574 --> 13:04.438
Uh-huh!

13:04.576 --> 13:08.166
What's the difference
between fired and retired?

13:08.304 --> 13:10.341
Two months' pay
and a farewell lunch!

13:11.687 --> 13:13.240
Look, Ben, old buddy.

13:13.378 --> 13:15.001
As Jim was saying
on the phone,

13:15.139 --> 13:17.486
the company's got this
mandatory retirement policy.

13:17.624 --> 13:19.281
Why?

13:19.419 --> 13:21.939
So we can make room
for the bright young
guys to get to the top.

13:22.077 --> 13:25.045
But you ain't got no bright
young guys to make room for!

13:25.183 --> 13:26.702
I know, but it ain't
just that, see.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.324
If we keep
the older workers on,

13:28.462 --> 13:30.810
then their
health insurance goes up
which cuts into profits.

13:31.741 --> 13:32.742
Well...

13:33.985 --> 13:36.919
George, I'm in good shape!

13:37.057 --> 13:39.749
George, this is plain stupid!

13:39.888 --> 13:42.822
Can't Allco Enterprises
make an exception
in Ben's case?

13:42.960 --> 13:44.754
Weezy, will you
get off my back?

13:44.893 --> 13:46.135
But it's not fair!

13:46.273 --> 13:47.550
Well, it' ain't my fault!

13:47.688 --> 13:50.933
Wait, wait, wait.
I don't want you
two fighting over me!

13:51.071 --> 13:53.315
You see that, Weezy,
you're getting Ben all upset!

13:53.453 --> 13:54.937
Come on over her, Ben.

13:56.559 --> 13:58.078
Look, Ben,

13:58.216 --> 14:00.253
retirement ain't the end
of the world.

14:00.391 --> 14:02.082
It's not?
No! I mean, look,

14:02.220 --> 14:04.498
you'll get a chance to do
some of the things
you always wanted to do.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.467
Like sleep late
in the morning, relax,
play checkers in the park.

14:07.605 --> 14:09.572
With the muggers
and the winos.

14:11.367 --> 14:12.748
Feed the pigeons.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.682
If your heart can
stand the excitement.

14:15.820 --> 14:17.753
Well, you know,
you get a chance to travel.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.444
Go to Europe or Japan.

14:19.582 --> 14:22.206
You don't travel
to Japan on Social Security.

14:22.344 --> 14:25.416
Okay, so there's Chinatown!
Same thing, only cheaper!

14:28.108 --> 14:29.696
Look, all right, all right.

14:29.834 --> 14:32.354
George, I know you're
trying to make me feel good,

14:32.492 --> 14:34.632
but really,
I enjoy working.

14:34.770 --> 14:36.806
And since Alberta passed on,

14:36.945 --> 14:38.291
I'm alone now

14:38.429 --> 14:41.501
and there ain't much
for me to be goin' home for.

14:41.639 --> 14:44.953
Every morning when I wake up,
I thank God for two things:

14:45.091 --> 14:48.094
One for letting me
wake up and, two,

14:48.232 --> 14:49.889
for having the
store to go to.

14:50.027 --> 14:51.821
That's my family now.

14:52.546 --> 14:53.720
Oh, Ben.

14:53.858 --> 14:56.102
Oh, that's all right, Louise.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.207
I'll see you all later.

14:58.345 --> 15:00.761
George! You're going
to let him go just like that?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.177
Of course not!

15:02.315 --> 15:03.695
Oh, you're not?

15:04.593 --> 15:07.078
This is me, Ben, George.

15:07.216 --> 15:10.771
You think I'm gonna
let you leave like that after
all these years? No way!

15:10.910 --> 15:12.221
Oh, thank goodness!

15:12.359 --> 15:13.843
You're gonna leave in style!

15:15.362 --> 15:18.538
I am gonna throw you
the biggest retirement
party anyone ever had.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.644
Party?

15:21.782 --> 15:23.819
We'll rent a ballroom
in a fancy hotel,

15:23.957 --> 15:25.441
hire a band,
get a big cake.

15:25.579 --> 15:27.271
And you'll be the
guest of honor.

15:28.099 --> 15:30.343
Yeah, George.
That's real nice.

15:31.585 --> 15:33.794
Aren't you forgetting
the gold watch?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.348
Okay. So we get you
one of those, too!

15:35.486 --> 15:36.936
No, no, George.

15:37.074 --> 15:38.938
I won't need
no gold watch.

15:39.076 --> 15:43.528
'Cause when I stop working,
they'll be no place
I have to be on time. Bye.

15:43.666 --> 15:45.289
Oh, wait, Ben.

15:46.221 --> 15:48.050
Aren't you going
to stay for lunch?

15:48.188 --> 15:49.741
No, Louise.

15:51.019 --> 15:53.676
It seems like I've lost
my appetite.

15:54.608 --> 15:57.301
I guess you don't eat as much

15:57.439 --> 15:58.854
when you're old!

16:09.140 --> 16:11.108
Oh, that's nice, George.

16:11.246 --> 16:13.696
Give a party
for good old Ben

16:13.834 --> 16:15.698
and then we'll
kick them out!

16:15.836 --> 16:17.217
Weezy.

16:17.355 --> 16:20.082
I think folks who
are able to work
oughta be allowed to work.

16:20.220 --> 16:21.497
I think so too!

16:21.635 --> 16:23.016
Get back to work!

16:30.230 --> 16:32.025
How could you
do this to Ben?

16:32.163 --> 16:35.304
Pushing him
out into the cold
just because he's over 60?

16:35.442 --> 16:38.514
It ain't my fault.
I didn't invent retirement.
The government did.

16:38.652 --> 16:39.860
Oh, yeah?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.966
Then why is Gerald Ford
running for President?

16:42.104 --> 16:43.416
He's 63!

16:43.554 --> 16:45.590
Well, maybe
he lied about his age.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.216
Look, Weezy,
if it was up to me,
I'd keep Ben on.

16:50.354 --> 16:52.804
It's Allco Enterprises
that's letting him go.

16:52.942 --> 16:54.530
It's not just Ben.

16:54.668 --> 16:56.843
You have someone
over 60 in every store

16:56.981 --> 16:58.810
and they are some
of your best workers.

16:58.948 --> 17:01.434
What are you getting
so upset about?
Maybe they want to retire.

17:01.572 --> 17:04.713
Old folks do all right.
They get Social Security
and food stamps.

17:04.851 --> 17:06.646
Uh-huh! $200 a month

17:06.784 --> 17:08.751
and all the dog food
they can eat.

17:12.376 --> 17:13.756
That's a lie.

17:13.894 --> 17:16.207
You can't buy dog food
with food stamps.

17:19.245 --> 17:21.143
Forced retirement
is terrible!

17:21.281 --> 17:23.352
And somebody ought
to do something about it.

17:23.490 --> 17:25.113
And I think you should
call off that merger!

17:25.251 --> 17:26.286
Are you crazy?

17:26.424 --> 17:28.047
We're gonna be walkin'
on easy street!

17:28.185 --> 17:30.221
Is that all you
can think of?

17:30.359 --> 17:32.741
Have you forgotten
all that Ben has
done for you?

17:32.879 --> 17:35.019
No.
Then what are you
gonna do about it?

17:35.157 --> 17:36.434
I'm...

17:36.572 --> 17:37.953
I'm getting outta here!

17:38.091 --> 17:40.369
You're just running off
'cause you don't
have a good answer!

17:40.507 --> 17:41.577
Yes, I do have
a good answer!

17:41.715 --> 17:43.510
Okay. Let's hear it.

17:43.648 --> 17:45.098
You're wrong.

18:11.538 --> 18:13.333
Do you come here often?

18:18.614 --> 18:21.100
You know, you and
I have a lot in common.

18:21.238 --> 18:23.550
We're both
jolly well potted.

18:26.450 --> 18:27.589
Sorry.

18:40.774 --> 18:42.397
Scotch on
the rocks, please.

18:44.088 --> 18:45.469
Why, Mr. Jefferson.

18:45.607 --> 18:47.091
Forgive me.

18:47.229 --> 18:49.818
You've been sitting here
all this time and
I didn't even notice you.

18:49.956 --> 18:51.440
I'm terribly sorry.

18:51.578 --> 18:53.822
Yeah, I'm terribly sorry
you noticed me,
too, Bentley.

18:54.374 --> 18:57.101
Then it's all right.

18:57.239 --> 19:01.450
You know, an hour ago
I was in a state of euphoria.

19:01.588 --> 19:04.039
Yeah, you should
go back there.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.317
Any place is better
than New York.

19:06.455 --> 19:08.664
But now, I'm in
the glepths of doom.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.667
Uh, doopths...

19:12.703 --> 19:14.222
Glem?

19:14.360 --> 19:16.396
The depths of gloom!

19:16.534 --> 19:18.985
Do you mind, Bentley?
I'm in enough
gloom of my own.

19:19.123 --> 19:21.470
Oh, good!
You know the old saying,

19:21.608 --> 19:23.265
"misery loves company."

19:23.403 --> 19:25.198
Thank you.
I got another one.

19:25.336 --> 19:27.442
"One's company,
two's a crowd."

19:27.580 --> 19:29.444
I've got a wonderful idea.

19:29.582 --> 19:30.548
Hey!

19:31.618 --> 19:34.380
Why don't you tell me
your sad story,

19:34.518 --> 19:36.727
and I will tell you mine?

19:36.865 --> 19:39.281
You go first.
Um, aren't you drinking?

19:39.419 --> 19:40.662
I thought I was.

19:41.939 --> 19:44.631
Uh, this time,
don't forget to bring
one for my friend.

19:45.494 --> 19:46.461
Go on.

19:48.670 --> 19:52.467
Well, there's this
big corporation that wants
to buy out all my stores.

19:52.605 --> 19:56.298
Which gives me a chance
to become a big executive
and make a lot of money. I...

19:56.436 --> 19:58.335
That is a sad story.

19:58.473 --> 20:00.129
Now let me tell you mine.

20:00.268 --> 20:01.752
I met Muriel
one afternoon...

20:01.890 --> 20:03.305
Look, I ain't
finished yet!

20:04.306 --> 20:05.963
Louise is mad at me

20:06.101 --> 20:08.552
because this company
is gonna do some things
that she doesn't like.

20:08.690 --> 20:09.656
Such as?

20:10.726 --> 20:13.419
You know Ben the manager
of my store next door?

20:14.178 --> 20:15.697
Yeah, salt of the earth.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.389
Well, Ben's
over 60 and...

20:18.527 --> 20:21.703
That's a peculiar
saying, isn't it?
"Salt of the earth?"

20:21.841 --> 20:23.394
We don't say,
"pepper of the earth."

20:23.532 --> 20:25.672
What?
Or, "mustard of the earth."

20:25.810 --> 20:27.398
The point is,

20:27.536 --> 20:29.711
this guy has worked
hard all his life.

20:29.849 --> 20:31.747
So don't you think a man
his age is entitled

20:31.885 --> 20:33.956
to sit back and
take it easy
for a change?

20:34.094 --> 20:36.959
I understand exactly
what you're saying,
Mr. Jefferson.

20:37.097 --> 20:38.961
You do?
Certainly.

20:39.099 --> 20:41.378
You're throwing Ben
on the scrap heap.

20:42.689 --> 20:45.140
They're making
me retire him.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.660
See, it ain't my fault!
Why should I feel guilty?

20:47.798 --> 20:50.214
Why should I feel
guilty about Muriel?

20:50.352 --> 20:51.836
Oh, Muriel.

20:51.974 --> 20:55.944
She's the salt, pepper
and mustard of the earth
all rolled into one.

20:57.186 --> 21:00.983
A seasoned veteran
in the spicy game of love.

21:01.121 --> 21:03.676
You get it?
Salt, pepper, seasoned.

21:03.814 --> 21:04.780
Bentley!

21:04.918 --> 21:06.472
Mandatory retirement, eh?

21:06.610 --> 21:07.956
That's too bad.

21:08.094 --> 21:11.131
I see they'll be retiring you,
too, in 12 years' time.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.754
Say what?

21:12.892 --> 21:16.102
Oh, yes. The retirement
program isn't limited to
employees like Ben.

21:16.240 --> 21:19.001
It includes management, too.
It's right here.

21:19.139 --> 21:20.796
Management?

21:20.934 --> 21:22.867
You mean when
I'm 60 they're gonna
give me the ax?

21:23.005 --> 21:25.767
Didn't you know that?
No, I didn't know that!

21:25.905 --> 21:28.079
Nobody's throwing
me out when I'm 60.

21:28.217 --> 21:29.529
What do they
expect me to do?

21:29.667 --> 21:31.048
Well, it might
be rather nice.

21:31.186 --> 21:32.774
You'll be able
to sleep late.

21:33.671 --> 21:35.363
Feed the pigeons?

21:35.501 --> 21:36.743
Play checkers in the park?

21:36.881 --> 21:38.158
Well, what
a pleasant thought

21:38.297 --> 21:39.677
You gotta be kidding!

21:41.092 --> 21:45.373
Sometimes I feel like
getting away from
it all myself.

21:45.511 --> 21:47.444
Just Muriel and me.

21:47.582 --> 21:50.378
Far from the madding crowd.

21:50.516 --> 21:52.759
If only Muriel could
understand that.

21:55.279 --> 21:57.937
If only Muriel's husband
could understand that.

22:17.266 --> 22:18.854
Weezy, darling!

22:18.992 --> 22:21.201
If you want lunch,
you're too late.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.272
There's more important
things in life than lunch

22:23.411 --> 22:24.998
Well, hallelujah!

22:25.136 --> 22:27.725
And Ben is one of them.
I'm calling off the merger.

22:28.554 --> 22:29.865
What?

22:30.003 --> 22:32.696
I'm calling off the deal.
You were right, I was wrong!

22:32.834 --> 22:35.250
George, do you mean it?
I mean it!

22:35.388 --> 22:36.631
What changed your mind?

22:36.769 --> 22:38.391
I changed my own mind.

22:38.529 --> 22:41.256
Nobody's gotta tell me
the difference between
right and wrong.

22:41.394 --> 22:43.431
And taking a man
like Ben, any man,

22:43.569 --> 22:46.434
and retiring him
in the prime of his life
is definitely wrong!

22:46.572 --> 22:50.507
Oh, George,
I'm so proud of you!

22:50.645 --> 22:52.578
So I just said to myself,

22:52.716 --> 22:55.235
"How would I feel
if I was in his place?"

23:00.896 --> 23:02.104
Right!

23:04.037 --> 23:06.833
So, I'm just gonna call
Jim Sparks and tell him
the deal's off.

23:08.525 --> 23:11.217
Ah, Mr. Jefferson,
you forgot your book.

23:11.355 --> 23:12.598
Thank you, Bentley.

23:12.736 --> 23:14.462
And it was a lucky
thing you did, too.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.361
Because after you left,
I perused it more carefully.

23:17.499 --> 23:19.087
You did what to it?

23:19.225 --> 23:21.123
And you know something?
I was wrong.

23:21.261 --> 23:22.608
About what?

23:22.746 --> 23:25.680
That mandatory retirement
rule does not apply to you.

23:25.818 --> 23:27.544
Only to your employees.

23:27.682 --> 23:30.374
What?
You mean they can't kick
me out after I'm 60?

23:30.512 --> 23:32.618
That's right. According...
That's terrific!

23:34.723 --> 23:36.207
Did you hear that, Weezy?

23:36.829 --> 23:37.864
I heard it.

23:38.002 --> 23:39.763
So now on...
So that's why you were able

23:39.901 --> 23:41.350
to put yourself
in Ben's place.

23:41.489 --> 23:43.905
But don't you
understand, Weezy?
Everything's okay now.

23:44.561 --> 23:46.217
Is it, George?

23:46.355 --> 23:47.564
Now, Weezy, look...

23:53.397 --> 23:54.674
Yeah, you're right.

23:54.812 --> 23:56.573
Nothing's changed for Ben.

23:57.505 --> 23:59.299
Okay,
I'll call off the deal.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.163
Oh, I'm glad, George.

24:01.301 --> 24:03.096
You're doing
the right thing.

24:03.234 --> 24:06.514
If you had to retire Ben
you could never
live with yourself.

24:06.652 --> 24:09.620
No. That's where
you're wrong.
I couldn't live with you.

24:09.758 --> 24:11.450
Oh, George!

24:39.374 --> 24:43.792
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
recorded on tape in front of
a studio audience.
