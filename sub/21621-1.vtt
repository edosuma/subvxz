WEBVTT

00:04.171 --> 00:05.072
Oh!

00:05.072 --> 00:06.173
Ho, ho,

00:06.240 --> 00:07.374
there it is.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.476
I'm sorry, Will. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. It's not...

00:42.543 --> 00:44.511
-Yo, man.
-This feels like it's not--

00:44.578 --> 00:47.915
-What the hell are you doing, man?
-It feels like it's such a big tune.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.350
You can't stop it on the Pig Latin.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.252
I feel like we need more.
I've actually been working

00:52.319 --> 00:55.489
on this new sort
of surround sound system.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.957
Do you wanna try it out?

00:57.024 --> 00:58.192
What-- yeah. What we got?

00:58.258 --> 00:59.560
All right, let me try. Hang on.

00:59.626 --> 01:01.195
Why are you rolling the window down?
You got--

01:01.261 --> 01:03.163
Hey, fellas, let's do it.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.168
-Oh.
-Oh.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.570
-Oh.
-That's right.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.471
-That's-- oh.
-Okay.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.081
-What?
-Oh, oh!

01:23.283 --> 01:25.085
-Oh.
-Oh!

01:27.254 --> 01:29.122
What?

01:35.329 --> 01:36.830
Oh!

01:36.897 --> 01:38.966
-Oh.
-Oh.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.567
-See you later, guys.
-Hey.

01:42.569 --> 01:44.671
Probably head on, eh?

01:44.738 --> 01:47.407
Kind of bust my groove
a little bit with that.

01:48.575 --> 01:49.843
It's just something
that we're working on.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.160
Thank you so much for being here

02:07.227 --> 02:09.062
-on the first episode.
-Well, did you like that?

02:09.128 --> 02:10.497
-You like that?
-I loved that.

02:10.564 --> 02:11.598
-Oh, this is--
-Apple Music.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.734
-It's sweet like that. Sweet like that.
-I loved that.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.235
When did you start rapping?

02:15.302 --> 02:17.571
I wrote my first rhyme when I was 12.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.240
-So that was like a rhyme just at school--
-Just as school was starting--

02:20.307 --> 02:22.075
or was that something
that ever got released?

02:22.109 --> 02:23.210
No, no, no, never got released.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.879
The first one that got released,
I was 16.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.781
'Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble'.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.917
But then you're still

02:29.983 --> 02:31.818
-at school at 16.
-Sixteen.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.688
I had a-- I had a record on the radio

02:34.755 --> 02:37.591
for the last 30 days

02:37.658 --> 02:39.493
as a senior, right?

02:39.560 --> 02:40.961
That must have been the best

02:41.094 --> 02:43.096
-30 days of your life.
-Hey, listen. Listen.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.899
You cannot beat

02:45.966 --> 02:48.468
your friends in high school

02:48.535 --> 02:50.170
knowing you have a hit record
on the radio.

02:50.237 --> 02:51.238
-Seriously though.
-Yeah.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.606
I mean, in your yearbook,

02:52.673 --> 02:55.742
were you named most likely
to have already succeeded?

02:55.876 --> 02:57.544
Right. Yeah.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.047
-Seriously.
-Yeah.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.793
Have you ever been asked,
has there ever been a conversation,

04:20.861 --> 04:23.230
has anyone said to you, would you
play Barack Obama in a movie?

04:23.297 --> 04:24.665
Someone must have called you about it.

04:24.731 --> 04:26.300
-Yes.
-Yeah? Is that something that you--

04:26.366 --> 04:28.202
-I talked to Barack about it.
-Did you?

04:28.268 --> 04:29.670
-Yeah.
-What did he say?

04:29.736 --> 04:31.839
He told me that he felt confident

04:31.905 --> 04:33.974
that I had the ears for the role.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.278
But you could-- you could incorporate

04:38.345 --> 04:41.849
some of your catchphrases into...

04:41.915 --> 04:44.651
-Into the air if I was to play Barack.
-Yeah.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.620
Yeah. Oh, hell no.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.988
Hell no. Yeah, you know,

04:48.088 --> 04:49.523
when they come
into the Situation Room.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.726
-Yeah.
-Oh, hell no.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.561
-Yeah.
-How many-- how many movies

04:54.628 --> 04:57.097
have you said 'Oh, hell no' in?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.565
Well, I put-- I put it in a couple.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.633
I haven't counted.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.535
Well, I'll ask you some questions and you

05:01.602 --> 05:03.537
-just give me an 'Oh, hell no', okay?
-Right. Oh, hell no.

05:03.604 --> 05:04.938
Ready?

05:05.038 --> 05:06.940
Oh, my word,
let me send you this hilarious

05:07.040 --> 05:08.442
12-minute video of my niece

05:08.509 --> 05:10.444
at her school recital.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.448
Oh, hell no.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.953
Best dance from the '90s was the Macarena.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.458
Oh, hell no.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.561
Hey, guys, guys, I ordered a pizza
with extra pineapple.

05:29.863 --> 05:32.132
Now, see. Now, hold on.
Now you're going too far because I'm like

05:32.199 --> 05:33.567
-being like-- Have you ever--
-Are you into that?

05:33.634 --> 05:36.069
-And pizza, you never, like--
-You like a pineapple on a pizza?

05:36.069 --> 05:38.372
-You don't-- you don't like it?
-Oh, hell no!

05:38.438 --> 05:40.073
All right.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.844
Hey, it's movie night. Guys,
I've rented Wild Wild West.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.716
Oh, hell no.

06:02.129 --> 06:06.033
When I was at school,
we tried to form a rap troop.

06:06.066 --> 06:09.036
A rap-- what?
See, you already move-- you already--

06:09.102 --> 06:10.771
you blew it already.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.673
Oh, we blew it.
Well, what would I call it?

06:12.739 --> 06:14.541
If you're trying to form a rap troop.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.876
Well, what is it then?

06:15.943 --> 06:17.945
-Like what is it then?
-Just a rap group.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.514
-Yeah, a rap group.
-No. A rap troop.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.049
A rap troop.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.283
-You're not gonna sell--
-I'm never gonna--

06:23.350 --> 06:24.818
-a single freaking record.
-Well, we were-- do you know--

06:24.885 --> 06:26.386
-do you know what my name was called?
-What?

06:26.453 --> 06:30.157
-Chubnasty.
-Chubnasty.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.159
I thought it was quite a good name.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.861
Will Smith and Chubnasty.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.196
-That is a gang.
-Will Smith featuring Chubnasty.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.664
Hundred percent.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.200
-Oh.
-Oh.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.603
-Whoa.
-Come on.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.338
-Ugh
-We're taking it way back.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.073
-Yo, yo, yo.
-This is it.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.635
I don't even know what that was like--

07:50.070 --> 07:52.506
-What the hell was I doing?
-Well, when you were at the door,

07:52.573 --> 07:53.941
-when you were at door.
-When I was at the door--

07:54.074 --> 07:56.076
-I loved it.
-I don't even know what that was. Yo.

07:56.109 --> 07:59.179
-That was it.
-Let me tell you what that time

07:59.246 --> 08:00.814
represented in my life.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.150
-Go on.
-Complete...

08:03.217 --> 08:05.786
unbridled freedom.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.387
-Really?
-I would--

08:07.454 --> 08:09.056
like even though
it's that thing like that,

08:09.122 --> 08:11.024
that-- the head move at the door, right?

08:11.024 --> 08:12.259
-Yeah.
-What is that?

08:12.326 --> 08:13.594
Why would I do that?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.495
-Like, what's that mean? Like--
-Yeah.

08:15.562 --> 08:18.832
I was in a place
where I would say anything,

08:18.899 --> 08:20.334
I would do anything.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.236
That was the most natural

08:22.302 --> 08:24.505
I've ever been in my life

08:24.571 --> 08:26.106
making The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.049
Now, is this true, you have a thing

08:37.049 --> 08:39.453
in your house called the Circle of Safety?

08:39.520 --> 08:41.188
-Yeah, the Circle of Safety.
-Is this true?

08:41.255 --> 08:44.858
-Tell me what the Circle of Safety is.
-The Circle of Safety is essentially,

08:45.759 --> 08:47.427
we told the kids,

08:47.494 --> 08:49.196
when you call a Circle of Safety,

08:49.263 --> 08:51.932
you're allowed to say anything.

08:52.065 --> 08:55.202
And whatever you say
in the Circle of Safety,

08:55.269 --> 08:57.437
-you can't be punished for.
-Right.

08:57.504 --> 09:00.474
And when your kids are five,
Circle of Safeties are fantastic.

09:00.541 --> 09:01.875
-Wonderful.
-Wonderful.

09:02.009 --> 09:05.412
When you have a 16-year-old daughter,
you don't want a Circle of Safety.

09:05.479 --> 09:09.349
You don't want it.
You don't want a Circle of Safety.

09:09.416 --> 09:12.486
-There's just stuff you don't wanna know.
-You don't-- it's like--

09:12.553 --> 09:15.155
it's like I've walked out
of three Circle of Safeties,

09:15.222 --> 09:17.124
like that's your mom.
You got to tell-- you got to--

09:17.191 --> 09:18.458
you got to talk to your mom.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.260
You got to talk to your mom,

09:20.327 --> 09:21.562
you know, so.

09:21.628 --> 09:24.565
I mean, we could make this now.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.033
-A circle? Okay.
-A car of safety.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.868
-A car of safety.
-It's just me and you.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.237
-It's just you and me. Nobody else.
-There's no one else here.

09:30.304 --> 09:33.373
-Well, Will, I love you.
-Okay.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.509
-Thank you.
-And I want you to know,

09:35.576 --> 09:38.245
I used to call

09:38.312 --> 09:40.047
my belly button

09:40.113 --> 09:41.915
my front butthole.

09:42.049 --> 09:43.183
Hmm.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.318
-Okay?
-Hmm.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.919
-I'm sharing that.
-Your--

09:46.053 --> 09:47.588
No ramifications.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.089
It's out there and it's gone.

09:50.724 --> 09:53.794
We first met-- do you remember--
you remember when we first met?

09:53.861 --> 09:56.763
-It was an award show.
-Uh-hmm. Oh, yes.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.365
-Yes, I do remember. Yeah.
-And-- Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.368
And that was the--
that was the first time we met.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.970
-Uh-hmm.
-We talked.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.872
-Uh-hmm.
-And it was, 'Oh, man, this is--

10:04.938 --> 10:06.073
you know, it was great, man.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.574
I love what you do', blah, blah, blah.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.076
-Uh-hmm.
-We did all of that.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.080
I didn't really know you that day.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.551
I had to look you up after.

10:18.819 --> 10:19.987
-I remember.
-I remember I--

10:20.087 --> 10:21.922
I remember it so clearly.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.991
I think I even text a friend of mine

10:24.091 --> 10:25.659
and I was like, 'Dude,

10:25.726 --> 10:27.995
Will Smith is so into me,

10:28.095 --> 10:29.630
it's incredible'.

11:46.740 --> 11:47.841
A little wedding over there. Look, look--

11:47.908 --> 11:49.543
Yo, someone's having
a beautiful wedding, I know.

11:49.610 --> 11:51.011
Beautiful wedding.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.447
Do you think-- do you ever wonder
if they're Will Smith fans?

11:53.514 --> 11:57.451
Pretty much most people
are Will Smith fans.

11:57.518 --> 11:58.552
-If you-- if you-- you can pretty--
-Yeah?

11:58.619 --> 12:00.454
-You can count on it pretty much.
-Do you reckon?

12:00.521 --> 12:01.688
You're right. Let's walk over there.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.457
-You reckon if we went over there--
-If we went over there--

12:03.524 --> 12:04.925
-They'd be Will Smith fans?
-Yes.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.426
-Exactly.
-All right. Hang on.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.533
-Will Smith.
-Oh, hey, hey, how you guys doing?

12:12.599 --> 12:13.834
How you guys doing? What's up?

12:13.901 --> 12:15.068
Hey, hey, how you guys doing?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.203
Look at--

12:18.805 --> 12:19.773
Hi.

12:25.612 --> 12:26.580
Hold on. Hold on.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.084
All right. Hold on.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.119
Hold on.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.154
Hold on.

12:37.558 --> 12:38.926
All right.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.360
Will Smith.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.096
-Oh, my, Will Smith.
-Hello. How are you?

12:43.096 --> 12:45.132
-How are you guys doin'? How are you?
-I'm okay.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.134
My daughter's getting married.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.002
Congratulations.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.370
All right. Thank you. Thank you.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.572
You guys real good.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.242
I guess you're right.

13:00.714 --> 13:03.750
Where's the strangest place
you've ever been recognized?

13:03.817 --> 13:06.486
Because there can't be
any corner of the planet now surely.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.555
-We were shooting Ali.
-Uh-huh.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.224
-And we were in Mozambique.
-Right.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.393
Right? And we were a hundred miles

13:13.460 --> 13:16.063
from the nearest electricity.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.130
-Right.
-Right?

13:17.197 --> 13:19.633
-Just in the middle of nowhere.
-In-- just in the middle of nowhere,

13:19.700 --> 13:22.069
you know, and there was a woman

13:22.102 --> 13:24.605
-washing clothes in a stream.
-Right.

13:24.671 --> 13:27.074
And I'm walking by behind her,
and she says,

13:27.107 --> 13:28.742
'Gettin' jiggy wit it'.

13:31.545 --> 13:32.646
-I was like--
-Are you serious?

13:32.713 --> 13:35.182
I was like how the hell does
she know that?

13:44.525 --> 13:46.393
-Talk to me about this guy.
-Oh. The just-- yeah.

13:46.460 --> 13:48.095
Talk to me about this.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.596
-Tell me all about this.
-No, this is--

13:49.663 --> 13:52.132
-this is a company we just started.
-Yeah.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.267
The bottleless paper base.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.303
Have you thought about taglines?

13:56.370 --> 13:57.304
-Taglines?
-For the commercial?

13:57.371 --> 13:58.472
-For the commercial?
-For the commercial?

13:58.539 --> 14:01.041
-So you--
-Just water,

14:01.074 --> 14:03.076
way wetter.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.511
Way wetter? Like it's way--

14:04.578 --> 14:05.679
it's way wetter than other water?

14:05.746 --> 14:07.347
Like it's wetter than other, way wetter.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.149
-Way wetter?
-Did you like that?

14:09.216 --> 14:10.250
Are you gonna-- are you-- are you--

14:10.317 --> 14:12.252
What about, 'Just water,

14:12.319 --> 14:13.787
give your mouth a bath?'

14:13.854 --> 14:16.590
You don't want people
to drink bath--

14:16.657 --> 14:18.792
like, the imagery
of drinking bath water is not...

14:18.859 --> 14:20.427
No, but you're giving
your mouth a bath.

14:20.494 --> 14:22.262
-You're giving your mouth--
-Like, what does your mouth

14:22.329 --> 14:24.364
-never get to do? Have a bath.
-Have a bath.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.667
The rest of your body
gets treated to a bath

14:26.733 --> 14:27.801
except this guy.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.970
Right. So you actually
keep your mouth closed

14:30.070 --> 14:31.305
-when you're in the bathtub--
-So you're-- exactly.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.441
-For a reason.
-What about, 'Just water,

14:34.508 --> 14:36.410
dolphins go mad for this stuff?'

14:36.476 --> 14:38.912
It's different-- it's not-- this isn't--

14:38.979 --> 14:40.447
this is, like,

14:40.514 --> 14:42.082
dolphins are in salt--

14:42.082 --> 14:43.350
-No, I get it.
-Yeah.

14:43.417 --> 14:44.952
I get it, I'm just saying.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.621
-It's a different kind of a water.
-Dolphins go mad for this s***.

14:48.789 --> 14:50.457
You would say s*** in a commercial?

14:50.524 --> 14:52.759
Well, no, online.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.228
All right. You know what,
I'm gonna have--

14:54.294 --> 14:56.396
I'm gonna have my people

14:56.463 --> 14:58.131
contact your people and they'll--

14:58.198 --> 14:59.533
we'll set something up,
we'll do a meeting.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.568
-Yeah?
-We'll sit down.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.137
And you're a hundred percent on that?

15:04.204 --> 15:06.740
-On sitting down?
-Oh, I mean I'm not-- so I'm not--

15:06.807 --> 15:08.709
-No, I mean, no. No. No. I mean--
-I'm not stuck to it, I'm not stuck to it.

15:08.775 --> 15:11.044
If you're gonna do the commercial,
it's good.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.515
Oh, man, this traffic's terrible.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.884
-I've never known traffic like this in LA.
-When we get up here,

15:16.950 --> 15:19.653
make a right, I got you, just make
a-- make a right off here, I got you.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.154
-What, you know a different way?
-Yeah, yeah.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.389
-All right. Sure.
-Right up.

15:22.456 --> 15:23.724
-Just take a right up here?
-Yup.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.292
For sure. Here we go.

15:27.828 --> 15:29.663
Are you sure this is gonna beat traffic?

15:29.730 --> 15:32.366
I mean, this doesn't even feel like
we're going in the right direction.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.402
This is where-- this is where
trust in a relationship--

15:35.469 --> 15:37.171
-Really?
-Yeah.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.872
Well, I trust you, man, hang on a sec.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.807
No, the tone of your voice
is not trusting.

15:40.874 --> 15:43.944
Hold on a second.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.383
Oh, this is a great idea.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.617
Put it there, man.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.419
Okay. This is it.

15:52.486 --> 15:53.620
-This is what we do, okay?
-All right.

15:53.687 --> 15:54.788
-This is how we do traffic.
-Let's do it.

15:54.855 --> 15:56.590
Hundred percent.

15:57.658 --> 15:59.159
This is the next level

15:59.226 --> 16:00.928
Carpool Karaoke,
you know what I'm saying?

16:01.028 --> 16:03.030
This is a Carpool Karaoke
like nothing else.

16:03.030 --> 16:06.333
-Like nothing else, you know?
-All right. Here we go.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.735
Oh, this is gonna be the most fun.

16:12.739 --> 16:13.807
This is insane.

16:13.874 --> 16:17.177
The worst thing about this is
if something happens to this helicopter.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.046
-Right.
-God forbid something should happen.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.248
-Yeah.
-No one's gonna write about me.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.618
-'Also travelling on that helicopter'.
-Yeah.

16:24.685 --> 16:26.486
-'And also crashed'.
-Yeah.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.088
That will be-- that will be it,

16:28.155 --> 16:30.224
that will be the headline.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.425
-Oh, here we go.
-Yeah.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.626
-Here we go now.
-Whoa.

16:32.693 --> 16:34.728
-Oh, yes.
-Yes.

16:34.795 --> 16:38.398
This is how we beat the traffic.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.802
What? Look at this.

16:41.869 --> 16:43.437
Will, this is so exciting.

16:43.504 --> 16:44.671
This is how we do.

16:44.738 --> 16:45.706
Oh, wow.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.207
I'll tell you what, it might be nice

16:47.274 --> 16:49.643
-to bust out a song up here.
-What you got, yo?

16:49.710 --> 16:51.645
Hey, pilot, can we put on a song

16:51.712 --> 16:54.081
that's appropriate
for this particular time?

16:54.147 --> 16:55.449
-Yes.
-All right. Let's hit it.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.646
Believe it, James.

17:25.712 --> 17:29.183
I believe it

17:53.073 --> 17:55.075
Here it comes. Here it comes.
Here it comes.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.653
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.056
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.123
-You know what?
-Yes?

18:10.190 --> 18:12.526
Have you ever seen the view

18:12.593 --> 18:14.328
from the tallest building

18:14.394 --> 18:15.696
west of the Mississippi?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.030
-You know I haven't. No.
-All right.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.498
I got you. I wanna show you something.

18:18.565 --> 18:19.833
-This guy.
-This is crazy.

18:19.900 --> 18:21.134
-It's like--
-Yes, yes.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.337
It's just--
it's just treat after treat after treat.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.572
-I don't know what I'm gonna--
-I got you. I got you.

18:25.639 --> 18:27.474
I don't know how
I'm gonna repay you for this.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.176
-Yeah-- no, I don't--
-Maybe we'll just go for like

18:29.243 --> 18:30.377
a camping weekend or something,

18:30.444 --> 18:32.846
we'd get out, kayaking.

18:32.913 --> 18:35.048
Just get on the open water,

18:35.048 --> 18:36.216
shoot the breeze,

18:36.283 --> 18:38.852
kick back, talk about the old times.

18:38.919 --> 18:40.621
-Yeah. That will be--
-We'll talk about this probably.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.689
We'll go, 'Do you remember
that time we're in that helicopter?'

18:42.756 --> 18:44.391
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
-Like-- you'll be like, 'Oh, yeah.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.960
It was amazing'.
So I feel like I've got a new best friend.

18:47.060 --> 18:47.928
Yeah.

18:48.061 --> 18:49.930
I feel-- I feel-- I feel-- I feel similar.

18:50.063 --> 18:51.465
You feel the same?
You feel the same.

18:51.532 --> 18:52.633
And that's what's great about it.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.201
-I feel-- I feel similar.
-Feel the same?

18:54.234 --> 18:56.937
You're my best friend.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.773
Probably a vacation together.
What are you doing for Christmas?

18:59.840 --> 19:01.675
What are you doing around Christmas time?

19:01.742 --> 19:04.711
-We wait and figure it out.
-Cool.

19:04.778 --> 19:06.780
-Just let me know.
-Yeah. I'll go and hit you, right.

19:06.847 --> 19:09.783
When we decide, I'll hit you.

19:09.850 --> 19:12.219
Yeah. Well, just-- because we're easy.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.787
That'll be so great.

19:13.854 --> 19:15.489
Hey, guys, I need you to put it down.

19:15.556 --> 19:17.324
-You got it. You got it landed.
-Put this puppy down.

19:18.692 --> 19:20.060
-Boom.
-Touchdown.

19:20.127 --> 19:21.028
-Touchdown.
-There it is.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.429
-Touchdown. Touch--
-Whoo.

19:22.496 --> 19:24.097
-Wait till you see this.
-Oh, man.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.834
-Oh, this is gonna be crazy.
-Oh, come on, man, let's do it.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.569
-Here we go.
-Oh, check it out, hey, I'm gonna--

19:28.635 --> 19:30.771
I'mma make a quick call.
I'mma make a quick call, all right?

19:30.838 --> 19:31.839
I got to make one call.
I'll be right out.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.207
We just got to--
you're coming out there?

19:33.273 --> 19:36.810
-All right. All right.
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

19:37.811 --> 19:39.279
Whoo.

19:42.716 --> 19:44.318

19:45.819 --> 19:47.454
I'll make a call. I'll make a quick call.

19:47.521 --> 19:48.789
What? No.

19:50.090 --> 19:51.658

19:54.061 --> 19:55.896
