WEBVTT

00:17.482 --> 00:20.953
- Ladies and gentlemen,

00:21.930 --> 00:26.930
please welcome to the
stage my cousin of hope

00:27.056 --> 00:29.273
Sergei Mokavek.

00:37.075 --> 00:39.992
In the envelope in Sergei's hand is

00:41.000 --> 00:45.200
the name of Interpol's most wanted badass.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.020
I wonder who that could be.

00:48.020 --> 00:50.127
Sergei, read the names.

00:52.516 --> 00:54.849
- Okay, so in numbers three,

00:58.328 --> 01:01.940
Hajina Do, head of Indian mafia.

01:01.940 --> 01:04.920
- Oh, it sucks to be him.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.920
Remind me to send a card for
him being a big blow off.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.110
- In second place.

01:11.110 --> 01:12.383
- Take your time Sergei.

01:14.258 --> 01:19.258
Slow, slow like X factors build trapper.

01:23.610 --> 01:26.057
- In number.

01:26.057 --> 01:27.510
- Speed it up, speed it up.

01:27.510 --> 01:28.343
- In number,

01:31.510 --> 01:35.010
in second place is Vladimir Shevchenko.

01:42.912 --> 01:45.130
- Stop your clapping!

01:45.130 --> 01:47.783
Shut off music and disco lights.

01:47.783 --> 01:50.422
We don't applause number two!

01:50.422 --> 01:53.716
- Number one bad
guy is the world is El Chito.

01:53.716 --> 01:54.728
- El Chito?

01:54.728 --> 01:55.968
- Chitock Beron from.

01:55.968 --> 01:58.737
- I know who he is Sergei.

01:58.737 --> 02:00.150
- What happens now?

02:00.150 --> 02:05.150
- Now, we press button on Antelope's Tail.

02:17.780 --> 02:22.140
- Right, now I know you're
all feeling pretty stupid

02:22.140 --> 02:25.320
after Ann pulled the wool
over all of your eyes.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.640
Yeah, but it happens and
I just want to assure you

02:27.640 --> 02:29.840
that you have the full
support from the entire.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.570
- Okay Joan move.

02:31.570 --> 02:33.260
You got a new mommy now.

02:33.260 --> 02:35.610
- I'm sorry can I help you?

02:35.610 --> 02:36.443
Who are you?

02:36.443 --> 02:38.620
- I'm Gemma Stone, CIA operations.

02:38.620 --> 02:40.250
The United Nations have put me in charge

02:40.250 --> 02:42.330
of crushing Vladimir Shevchenko.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.270
Now who is in charge of this shit show?

02:44.270 --> 02:45.450
- Well that would be me.

02:45.450 --> 02:48.074
I'm Ruth Brooks, head
of MI-6 special branch

02:48.074 --> 02:50.740
and you have no jurisdiction
in the United Kingdom.

02:50.740 --> 02:52.870
- Okay, nobody cares about
your country anymore.

02:52.870 --> 02:54.960
- Um, this country was at
the forefront of intelligence

02:54.960 --> 02:56.402
for as long as I can remember.

02:56.402 --> 02:57.235
- Okay, so your lips are moving

02:57.235 --> 02:59.440
but I'm not really listening
to what you're saying.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.790
It's like pieces of wood are
falling out of your mouth.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.477
- Look, whatever your name is.

03:04.477 --> 03:05.600
We need to take a minute.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.350
- Yeah, you don't have a minute.

03:07.350 --> 03:08.740
Go home.

03:08.740 --> 03:09.993
- Okay, great, yeah sure.

03:10.958 --> 03:11.823
Sure, I'll just head off.

03:12.820 --> 03:14.755
- Ruth I have something you should see.

03:14.755 --> 03:16.560
- Ruth doesn't work here anymore.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.800
She was just leaving.

03:17.800 --> 03:18.930
- I really ought to take a look.

03:18.930 --> 03:20.980
- Yeah, I really think that you shouldn't.

03:20.980 --> 03:23.500
Hey, I can make this more
embarrassing for you.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.655
Rex, Sarason.

03:25.655 --> 03:28.507
- Oh great, they've got dog names, lovely.

03:28.507 --> 03:32.220
- You know what, let's just
throw this out to the floor.

03:32.220 --> 03:34.480
Okay, put your hand in the air

03:34.480 --> 03:36.983
if you think Ruth should stay.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.593
Anyone at all?

03:42.140 --> 03:44.453
- Okay, you look like you need to shit.

03:45.513 --> 03:47.530
Can you just fucking move?

03:47.530 --> 03:48.363
Thank you.

03:50.790 --> 03:52.510
- Okay, what have we got?

03:52.510 --> 03:55.563
- It's Shevchenko, he's just
uploaded a video this morning.

03:57.182 --> 04:00.926
- Oh, hello world.

04:00.926 --> 04:02.176
I am Vladimir Shevchenko.

04:04.363 --> 04:08.030
In my possession I have
the Antelope's Tail.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.958
Oh, now I have your attention.

04:15.759 --> 04:18.959
You might as well shit
inside of yourselves

04:18.959 --> 04:21.992
because come this Wednesday

04:21.992 --> 04:26.992
I shall push the button on Antelopes Tail.

04:27.050 --> 04:29.160
Causing destruction that

04:29.160 --> 04:32.510
has never been seen on earth before.

04:32.510 --> 04:37.137
This day shall be known as
Antelope's Tail-maggedon.

04:38.267 --> 04:40.250
Antelope's Tail-maggedon.

04:40.250 --> 04:43.234
Guys, guys, Antelope's Tail.

04:43.234 --> 04:44.310
- Antelope's Tail-maggedon.

04:45.148 --> 04:46.597
- All at the same time.

04:46.597 --> 04:48.885
- Antelope's Tail-maggedon.

04:48.885 --> 04:50.546
- Antelope's Tail-maggedon.

04:50.546 --> 04:51.880
- Ah, your an idiot fool.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.480
Mike shut it off.

04:53.480 --> 04:54.760
- Let's get this down ASAP.

04:54.760 --> 04:56.710
We need to keep a lid on this thing.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.230
- We may be too late ma'am.

04:58.230 --> 05:01.000
- We cut now from one piece
of news or media reaction

05:01.000 --> 05:03.800
to the next as hysteria and
information-mania surround

05:03.800 --> 05:05.690
the mystery of exact nature of

05:05.690 --> 05:08.360
the Antelope's Tail
spreads around the world.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.840
- What does the Antelope's
Tail actually do?

05:10.840 --> 05:12.990
- One theory is that if
the button is pressed.

05:12.990 --> 05:14.490
- All the volcanoes on the planet

05:14.490 --> 05:17.310
will erupt a precisely the same time.

05:17.310 --> 05:20.040
- Causing a really mega big tsunami.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.180
- And a million random
children's heads will explode.

05:23.180 --> 05:26.280
- Every dog in the world
will turn on his master.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.987
- Dinosaurs will come back to life.

05:28.987 --> 05:30.700
- And if that theory is true.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.550
- Then every fish in the world

05:32.550 --> 05:34.900
will float to the top of the water.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.280
- I guess it's real power is

05:36.280 --> 05:39.213
that no one really knows what it does.

05:47.814 --> 05:50.397
- Ah Ruth, Ruth Brooks it's me.

05:52.220 --> 05:54.280
I'm alive.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.129
I'm not a ghost.

05:56.129 --> 05:57.640
- I know you're not a ghost.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.162
I don't believe in ghosts anyway.

05:59.162 --> 06:00.123
- Well you should.

06:00.123 --> 06:02.380
When I was a little boy
the ghost of an old man

06:02.380 --> 06:05.840
used to sneak inside my
room from by bedroom window.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.622
Sit at the end of the
bed and tickle my toes.

06:08.622 --> 06:10.820
Come to think of it,
maybe it wasn't a ghost.

06:10.820 --> 06:13.130
It might have been a weird old man.

06:13.130 --> 06:15.210
- Oh god it's bunk.

06:15.210 --> 06:16.750
What do you want man?

06:16.750 --> 06:17.583
- Shevchenko.

06:18.702 --> 06:20.750
I know where he is.

06:20.750 --> 06:23.760
- Okay, this is how the US roll.

06:23.760 --> 06:27.230
We ain't here to dance,
we fire straight in.

06:27.230 --> 06:29.500
Civilian causalities, in my mind

06:29.500 --> 06:31.620
that's just an unlucky break I never met.

06:31.620 --> 06:33.904
Okay, are you set soldier?

06:33.904 --> 06:36.360
- We are outside Vladimir
Shevchenko's headquarters.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.260
- Then Mission Castle Fucker is a go.

06:39.260 --> 06:41.872
Operation is go, go, go Team Five.

06:41.872 --> 06:43.610
- Go, go, go, go.

06:43.610 --> 06:44.750
- That's a go, go, go, go.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.021
Team Six?

06:46.021 --> 06:47.324
- We are go, go, go.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.157
- Go, go.

06:48.157 --> 06:48.990
- Go, go, go.

06:48.990 --> 06:50.341
- Go, go, go, go.

06:53.336 --> 06:56.310
Oh, oh right in the fucking face.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.527
Ow! Fuck you asshole.

07:02.323 --> 07:04.073
I'd say goodbye to your kids bitch.

07:05.353 --> 07:06.280
Are you getting this?

07:06.280 --> 07:09.248
- We got him mum, we got him.

07:09.248 --> 07:12.690
Put your hands up and
identify yourself sir.

07:12.690 --> 07:14.163
Identify yourself!

07:16.305 --> 07:19.023
- Hi, I'm Vlad Shevchenko.

07:19.023 --> 07:21.220
- Left turn and state your name.

07:21.220 --> 07:23.550
- Hi, I am Vlad Shevchenko.

07:23.550 --> 07:24.570
- What the fuck is going on?

07:24.570 --> 07:26.830
- You turn slow
and identify yourself!

07:26.830 --> 07:29.970
- Hey, I am Vlad Shevchenko.

07:29.970 --> 07:30.843
- Oh my god.

07:32.470 --> 07:33.793
Shit look alikes.

07:35.970 --> 07:37.680
- Hello my enemies.

07:39.058 --> 07:43.053
Did you enjoy our game of hide and seeks.

07:44.170 --> 07:45.323
Peek-a-boo!

07:47.779 --> 07:52.590
Hold up, you're not Ruth Brooks.

07:52.590 --> 07:56.960
- Forget Ruth Brooks, I'm in charge now.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.010
You give me the god damn Antelope's Tail

07:59.010 --> 08:00.940
or I will rip your nuts
right out of their sack.

08:00.940 --> 08:05.940
- I didn't call for sexy time
but gee, oh yes, I'm aroused.

08:07.890 --> 08:10.160
- I will stand on your fucking neck

08:10.160 --> 08:12.435
and I will shoot your
teeth out one by one.

08:12.435 --> 08:15.526
- Slow down and savor it.

08:15.526 --> 08:18.520
I'm about to shoot my bunk already.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.420
- Listen, I am hunting you down.

08:21.420 --> 08:23.880
I'm throwing everything
I've got into breaking you

08:23.880 --> 08:26.880
and you should know that I fight dirty.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.167
- That's the way I like it.

08:29.167 --> 08:33.553
But I'm in the most
secretive place on earth.

08:33.553 --> 08:37.812
You'll never ever find me.

08:43.130 --> 08:43.963
- Why am I here?

08:43.963 --> 08:47.004
- Well because Huxley and I and me

08:47.004 --> 08:49.270
have broken the abacus code.

08:49.270 --> 08:51.380
I know where Shevchenko is.

08:51.380 --> 08:52.213
- Go on.

08:52.213 --> 08:53.150
- Well Huxley will explain,

08:53.150 --> 08:55.303
he's something of a computer whiz.

08:55.303 --> 08:56.810
- I see.

08:56.810 --> 08:58.440
- Yes, please.

08:58.440 --> 09:01.027
So well, once I started
to look around for.

09:01.027 --> 09:02.710
- Yep.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.940
- Once I started to
look around for any data

09:04.940 --> 09:07.440
that could lead us to
Shevchenko, I came across this.

09:07.440 --> 09:09.379
- And I said, straightaway,
that's the abacus sign.

09:09.379 --> 09:10.940
That is what you've got there,

09:10.940 --> 09:12.080
it's definitely the abacus sign.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.530
Seen it everywhere on this mission.

09:13.530 --> 09:15.360
That is the abacus sign right there.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.193
- And I thought.

09:16.193 --> 09:17.570
- We thought.

09:17.570 --> 09:20.160
- We thought that there
could be much more to it.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.310
- Yeah and that's where things

09:21.310 --> 09:23.430
started to get really interesting.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.263
- So I.

09:24.263 --> 09:25.256
- No we.
- Built an.

09:25.256 --> 09:26.089
- We built.

09:26.089 --> 09:26.922
- Built an algorithm.

09:26.922 --> 09:27.755
- We built an algorithm.

09:27.755 --> 09:29.070
- A computer based system
that searches through

09:29.070 --> 09:31.560
like any occult signs
and system on the net.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.133
- I was gonna say exactly
what he's saying right now.

09:33.133 --> 09:36.770
That was actually, I
was, read my mind bro.

09:36.770 --> 09:39.070
- Then I thought, why don't I use

09:39.070 --> 09:40.750
the algorithm to search for.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.100
- It's a map!

09:42.100 --> 09:43.460
It's a map Ruth.

09:43.460 --> 09:44.450
My god, it's a map.

09:44.450 --> 09:45.770
It's a freaking map girl.

09:45.770 --> 09:47.060
- A map of what?

09:47.060 --> 09:49.524
- Um, some sort of
underground mining tunnels.

09:49.524 --> 09:51.641
- In the mountains,
they're in the mountains.

09:51.641 --> 09:54.190
- Mayaliviac, Vlad's Republic.

09:54.190 --> 09:56.747
So the little circles here are bunkers

09:56.747 --> 09:58.567
and the ones over here the
large ones are the ones where.

09:58.567 --> 10:01.845
- That that right there is
a secret underground base.

10:01.845 --> 10:05.050
- You can see that um you
can access the tunnels

10:05.050 --> 10:06.790
via an old disused damn.

10:06.790 --> 10:09.800
- Ruth this is where Shevchenko is.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.103
I bet my life on it.

10:14.054 --> 10:16.813
- Well this is fantastic work.

10:19.379 --> 10:21.020
What do you need from me?

10:21.020 --> 10:21.853
- A village.

10:22.970 --> 10:23.850
- A village?

10:23.850 --> 10:25.700
- I've always wanted to
start my own community

10:25.700 --> 10:28.130
and I think now I have the
skills to go off and do that.

10:28.130 --> 10:28.963
- What?

10:28.963 --> 10:29.980
- We don't need a village.

10:29.980 --> 10:33.350
That is actually the last
thing, scrub a village.

10:33.350 --> 10:34.900
I mean we have that locked and loaded.

10:34.900 --> 10:38.970
We need Action Team back
together to fight this one out.

10:38.970 --> 10:40.950
- Yes, well I can track Action Team down.

10:40.950 --> 10:43.690
The last I heard they
were on gardening leave.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.260
- How can?

11:16.260 --> 11:19.593
- Yeah, Spink Rat, I'm alive, I'm alive.

11:27.910 --> 11:29.441
- Well that's good then.

11:29.441 --> 11:30.274
- Good for me.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.910
Yeah, I'm brilliant.

11:31.910 --> 11:33.464
- Yeah, yeah.

11:39.444 --> 11:40.277
- Dah, um.

11:42.219 --> 11:43.438
- Are you okay?

11:43.438 --> 11:46.078
- No, no not really.

11:46.078 --> 11:49.520
It's been a bit rough mate to be honest.

11:49.520 --> 11:50.520
- I have a question.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.885
Did you have a fake funeral for me?

11:53.885 --> 11:54.968
- Yes we did.

11:56.704 --> 12:00.317
Uh, we had a few drinks in the Nelson.

12:00.317 --> 12:03.440
And then I had to carry on on my own.

12:03.440 --> 12:04.490
- Oh nice.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.140
- Ga, I'm really struggling
to hold this together man.

12:06.140 --> 12:07.950
- Me too moucher.

12:07.950 --> 12:08.783
Me too.

12:09.900 --> 12:12.050
- So you're alive then.

12:12.050 --> 12:14.260
- Oh, I forgot about you in all this.

12:14.260 --> 12:15.810
My demise must have ripped you up

12:15.810 --> 12:18.217
like a bad burrito from the inside.

12:18.217 --> 12:19.363
- No not really.

12:21.770 --> 12:23.700
So we're going back to work then, or what?

12:23.700 --> 12:26.223
- I think what she means Graham is.

12:27.057 --> 12:28.140
- Can we kick it?

12:28.140 --> 12:30.977
- Yes, we can.

12:39.104 --> 12:42.447
- So you know what I am giggling at?

12:42.447 --> 12:47.233
I always thought my final
meal would be steak.

12:48.580 --> 12:53.580
Yet here I sit eating
fajitas for the first time.

12:54.882 --> 12:59.513
Such a weird thing to do, right?

13:02.000 --> 13:05.163
Never scared to break new boundaries.

13:09.960 --> 13:13.533
Am I sensing a little seed,

13:16.710 --> 13:18.723
of negativity around this table?

13:20.780 --> 13:21.730
Is there a problem?

13:23.367 --> 13:25.593
- Do we have to press the button?

13:26.590 --> 13:29.573
- Of course we have to press the button.

13:30.420 --> 13:33.534
That's what all of this has been for.

13:33.534 --> 13:35.523
It's our destiny.

13:36.456 --> 13:37.780
WHat's wrong?

13:37.780 --> 13:41.940
Have you lost your nerve
now you have a girlfriend?

13:41.940 --> 13:45.073
You become pussy whipped little bitch.

13:45.985 --> 13:50.390
Look at you, sitting there
better than everyone else

13:50.390 --> 13:53.213
because you have a new whore.

14:01.950 --> 14:04.083
That was insensitive and callous of me.

14:05.020 --> 14:08.750
Ridicule you only because
you have found love.

14:08.750 --> 14:12.850
And I'm sorry for it.

14:12.850 --> 14:14.017
You know what?

14:15.760 --> 14:17.453
Maybe you sit this one out.

14:18.716 --> 14:22.488
Go be with your girl, do couple stuff.

14:22.488 --> 14:24.433
Have a picnic in park.

14:25.580 --> 14:29.320
Get one of those bicycles you
can ride at the same time.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.590
What do they call, Demetri please?

14:31.590 --> 14:32.690
- Tandem.

14:32.690 --> 14:36.270
- The tandem, go have a
tandem ride together with her.

14:36.270 --> 14:39.626
- Look Vlad, I don't want
special treatment okay.

14:39.626 --> 14:41.376
- Oh, you deserve it.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.423
Go.

14:44.677 --> 14:45.510
- Nah.

14:48.460 --> 14:51.351
Enjoy your dinner everyone.

14:51.351 --> 14:53.339
Thanks Vlad.

15:07.192 --> 15:08.692
- We are bad guys.

15:09.864 --> 15:14.097
That should mean something
to each and every one of you.

15:14.097 --> 15:19.094
It means we act first and
we think about it later.

15:19.094 --> 15:22.218
Usually with a large regret.

15:22.218 --> 15:26.995
Like right now, I'm
regretting shooting Bogohardt.

15:26.995 --> 15:30.913
He was a good man and a loyal soldier.

15:30.913 --> 15:34.283
But that is what being a bad guy is.

15:35.396 --> 15:38.051
So anyone else around this table

15:38.051 --> 15:43.051
don't got the stomach for
it, want to follow him.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.623
No, I didn't think so.

15:57.378 --> 15:59.545
Eat, eat, eat the fajitas!

16:02.130 --> 16:04.560
- I say we just fire a nuke right into his

16:04.560 --> 16:07.137
shit pot little republic and
let's see how he likes that.

16:07.137 --> 16:10.340
- We are not launching a
full stage nuclear attack

16:10.340 --> 16:12.051
because you lost this man.

16:12.051 --> 16:14.230
- Hey, it wasn't just me.

16:14.230 --> 16:15.740
It was a team fuck up.

16:15.740 --> 16:16.750
Like we all fucked up a little bit

16:16.750 --> 16:18.710
and that made one massive fuck up.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.310
- Enough, Mrs. Potty Mouth.

16:20.310 --> 16:22.810
My question remains, does anyone have

16:22.810 --> 16:25.900
the faintest idea where
Vladimir Shevchenko is?

16:25.900 --> 16:26.793
- Yes, I do.

16:28.397 --> 16:31.574
Sally, link me up to
channels two four eight.

16:31.574 --> 16:32.910
- Oh, but that.

16:32.910 --> 16:35.160
- Action Team, they're back.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.394
- Who the hell are Action Team?

16:36.394 --> 16:39.057
- They're the only hope we've got.

16:39.057 --> 16:40.730
Sally, I need full thermal imaging

16:40.730 --> 16:42.080
on the following coordinates.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.896
Two, four, eight northwest.

16:43.896 --> 16:44.729
- Hold on a minute Brooks.

16:44.729 --> 16:45.562
You do not have the authority.

16:45.562 --> 16:46.893
- No, but I have the intel.

16:48.512 --> 16:49.993
Do you?

16:53.800 --> 16:55.200
Do you?

16:55.200 --> 16:56.033
- No.

16:56.033 --> 16:56.866
- You don't.

16:57.830 --> 16:58.663
- Come on.

17:02.340 --> 17:04.070
Now, fuck off.

17:04.070 --> 17:05.510
- Sorry Ruth can we get on with this?

17:05.510 --> 17:07.090
- Absolutely yes, right.

17:07.090 --> 17:08.450
Sally link me up.

17:08.450 --> 17:10.090
- Just patching you through mum.

17:10.090 --> 17:11.550
- Thank you.

17:11.550 --> 17:13.958
- This is Action Team going live.

17:52.636 --> 17:55.386
- Ah .

17:57.556 --> 17:59.611
- Hello Monica.

17:59.611 --> 18:00.444
- Uriand.

18:01.550 --> 18:03.333
Done something different with your hair?

18:03.333 --> 18:04.782
- What did y'all do to me.

18:04.782 --> 18:05.814
- Shut up!

18:05.814 --> 18:08.899
- Oe, you leave the kid
out of this all right?

18:08.899 --> 18:10.597
Your battle's here you muppet.

18:10.597 --> 18:15.340
- Vlad, I have intercepted Action Team.

18:15.340 --> 18:19.020
I repeat, I have intercepted Action Team.

18:19.020 --> 18:20.540
- I heard you the first time.

18:20.540 --> 18:24.135
I repeat I heard you the first time.

18:24.135 --> 18:26.788
- Vladimir, don't worry we're coming.

18:26.788 --> 18:28.623
- Wait for me.

18:28.623 --> 18:31.003
- Oh don't you worry, Sergei.

18:31.891 --> 18:36.891
This is the perfect showdown
I had planned all along.

18:39.960 --> 18:43.722
- So this is the end of Action Team.

18:43.722 --> 18:46.972
Now you die in tunnel like toilet rats.

18:57.850 --> 18:58.683
- Ah, ah.

19:14.237 --> 19:16.070
- Bit much there mate.

19:19.334 --> 19:21.834
- All is fair in love and war.

19:24.291 --> 19:27.291
- I have been expecting you Mr. Man.

19:28.881 --> 19:32.464
Mr. Man, Mr. Man I have
been expecting you.

19:37.045 --> 19:40.244
Well, well, well I've been expecting.

19:40.244 --> 19:43.193
I've been expecting you Mr. Man.

19:44.950 --> 19:45.990
- Oh there you are?

19:45.990 --> 19:47.490
- Mr. Man I have been.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.880
- You know you should really
get this place sign posted.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.027
- Mr. Man I have been.

19:51.027 --> 19:54.210
- Had me walking around like
a headless chicken for ages.

19:54.210 --> 19:55.280
- Mr. Man I have been.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.000
- Tunnel after tunnel,
place is like a Labyrinth.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.090
- Listen if you don't mind, I
have a whole thing prepared.

20:01.090 --> 20:02.630
If you could just let me.

20:02.630 --> 20:04.277
- Oh, what.

20:04.277 --> 20:07.890
- Mr. Man I've been expecting you.

20:07.890 --> 20:09.990
- And I expect I'm gonna enjoy this.

20:09.990 --> 20:13.180
- You're just going to shoot me,

20:13.180 --> 20:16.160
like big cowardly custard.

20:16.160 --> 20:20.110
Or are you gonna fight me like a man.

20:20.110 --> 20:22.050
- Shoot him, just shoot him agent.

20:22.050 --> 20:23.850
Do not be drawn into his games.

20:23.850 --> 20:26.050
- I think I might just press the button

20:26.050 --> 20:31.050
on the Antelope's Tail just
cause you are such a sucker.

20:32.900 --> 20:37.360
- You sir, have just offended
me one too many times.

20:37.360 --> 20:39.826
I hope you like whoop ass.

20:39.826 --> 20:41.226
You just opened a can of it.

21:39.916 --> 21:41.249
- Get off of me.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.653
- Logan, Logan do you copy?

22:06.220 --> 22:07.203
Agent do you copy?

22:11.665 --> 22:16.665
- This is Logan Man of Action
Team, Shevchenko is down.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.433
I'm alive.

22:19.460 --> 22:20.810
I have the Antelope's Tail.

22:21.890 --> 22:24.893
- Well done agent, now get on home.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.930
- Well it was touch and
go there for a minute mum.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.580
He was kicking my ass and I
kicked his for a little bit.

22:31.580 --> 22:35.750
Then he kicked mine again and
at one point I saw my life.

22:35.750 --> 22:38.010
- Yeah, all right agent,
I just said well done.

22:38.010 --> 22:40.710
Please don't milk it, go for Martin.

22:40.710 --> 22:42.930
- Loco mate, I don't mean
to piss on your parade

22:42.930 --> 22:45.386
but you've got 30
seconds before she blows.

22:45.386 --> 22:50.110
- What?
