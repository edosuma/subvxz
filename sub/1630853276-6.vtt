00:01.653 --> 00:04.656
Previously on
"Billy the Kid"...

00:04.787 --> 00:08.747
Billy. You're alive.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.314
You wanna join us, Billy?

00:10.445 --> 00:12.621
I still have a hankering
to go straight, Jesse.

00:12.751 --> 00:15.624
How's that gonna happen?
You're wanted in two counties.

00:15.754 --> 00:16.799
That might
be a problem.

00:16.929 --> 00:18.583
I mean, if you wanna
ride with us.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.020
Thing going on between
you and Barbara.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.543
Hey, just tell me,
you do it in your bed

00:21.673 --> 00:22.587
or you do it in mine?

00:22.718 --> 00:23.936
This isn't gonna work.

00:24.067 --> 00:26.330
I'm not sure I can accept
having to share you.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.332
I won't belong
to either of you, Billy.

00:28.463 --> 00:30.291
Jesse, don't.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.293
And you know what?
You can't shoot him.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.251
Why not?

00:34.382 --> 00:35.644
This Chihuahua?

00:42.520 --> 00:44.566
Melquiades Segura.

00:44.696 --> 00:47.612
The first thing you're gonna
need in this town is a gun.

00:51.442 --> 00:52.748
You told me
you play poker.

00:52.878 --> 00:55.359
-There's a big game in town.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.753
Dealer is this man called
Don Ortiz. He cheats.

00:57.883 --> 01:00.712
I'm not sure how he cheats,
but I'm pretty sure he does it.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.338
We have prepared
the guest room for you.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.209
They want us to stay.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.386
Our money! It's gone!

01:22.517 --> 01:24.736
They made fools of us!
What are we gonna do?

01:24.867 --> 01:26.434
I'm not a criminal.

01:26.564 --> 01:28.914
You told me
you rustled cattle,

01:29.045 --> 01:30.786
you stole horses.

01:30.916 --> 01:32.266
Those are crimes, my friend.

01:32.396 --> 01:33.745
Not against people.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.617
I wanna win
my money back.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.297
What can I get you?

02:50.082 --> 02:51.562
Whiskey.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.308
Sure raining out.

02:58.439 --> 02:59.875
Yeah.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.778
Why are you staring at me?

04:16.908 --> 04:18.910
Thought I recognized you,
is all.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.912
And did you?

04:21.043 --> 04:22.523
I don't know.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.834
Depends...

04:29.965 --> 04:32.576
if this is you.

04:37.407 --> 04:41.542
Now, I'm not saying
it's a great likeness.

04:41.672 --> 04:44.849
But it's pretty like,
wouldn't you say?

04:53.423 --> 04:55.599
I'd like to know why
you're holding on to that.

04:55.730 --> 05:00.517
I'm ridin' with
a good friend of yours.

05:00.648 --> 05:05.043
He talks about you all the time.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.958
Who might that be?

05:07.089 --> 05:09.874
Jesse Evans.

05:10.005 --> 05:14.314
We're holed up
not too far from here.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.628
You know Jesse?

05:24.759 --> 05:27.979
Sure, I do.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.722
Where are you headed?

05:37.249 --> 05:40.775
Maybe we could
ride over together,

05:40.905 --> 05:43.691
so you could say hello
to Jesse again.

05:43.821 --> 05:47.216
I'm sure he'd appreciate that.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.611
Last time I saw Jesse, things
weren't too good between us.

05:54.789 --> 05:57.705
I don't think Jesse
harbors any grudges.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.663
Not towards you, anyway.

06:07.105 --> 06:09.978
What's your name?

06:10.108 --> 06:12.197
My name?

06:12.328 --> 06:15.375
I'm Pat Garrett.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.993
Heads up, boys!
It's Pat!

07:09.124 --> 07:10.604
He's got someone with him!

07:10.734 --> 07:12.693
Hyah! Hyah!

07:18.046 --> 07:18.960
Jesse, you maybe
wanna come out here.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.142
Hello, Jesse.

07:34.279 --> 07:36.020
Met Pat Garrett here
out on the road,

07:36.151 --> 07:37.587
minding my own business.

07:37.718 --> 07:39.633
Mm-hmm.

07:41.809 --> 07:44.725
It's a neat little hideout.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.770
Oh, I like it.
Real private.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.123
You remember Bob Olinger?

07:52.254 --> 07:54.648
John Beckwith?

07:54.778 --> 07:56.867
Sure do.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.626
This okay, Jesse?

08:21.805 --> 08:23.024
Sure it is, Kid.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.983
I'm real glad
to see you, Billy.

08:26.114 --> 08:29.944
Surely fate's brought us
back together again.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.249
You gonna ride
with us this time?

08:31.380 --> 08:34.035
Depends what you're cookin' up.

08:34.165 --> 08:38.169
Rustling John Chisum's cattle.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.954
You heard of John Chisum?

08:40.084 --> 08:43.392
They call him
the Cattle King of America.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.742
He's got herds here in Texas,

08:45.873 --> 08:48.136
in New Mexico,
all over Lincoln County.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.617
He is one rich son of a bitch,

08:50.747 --> 08:55.186
and we're making good money
selling his cattle to the army.

08:55.317 --> 08:57.058
You in?

09:10.767 --> 09:12.116
I'm with you.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.947
We were meant
to ride together, Billy.

09:17.078 --> 09:20.821
I know that. You know that.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.869
Let's get you squared away.

09:32.223 --> 09:33.442
How'd you know Garrett?

09:33.573 --> 09:37.011
I don't, not so much.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.230
I know he worked
as a buffalo hunter in Texas

09:39.361 --> 09:42.016
before they blasted
the last herds away.

09:42.146 --> 09:45.759
Then he worked as a cowboy
and a cowpuncher in New Mexico.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.151
But something happened
back then,

09:47.282 --> 09:49.501
and he never
talks about it.

09:49.632 --> 09:53.288
But...I figure
he's smart enough.

09:53.418 --> 09:56.117
He's pretty fearless. I...

09:56.247 --> 09:58.641
-I seen that side of him.
-Hmm.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.733
What happened to Barbara?

10:07.519 --> 10:09.957
Oh, you know, she, uh...

10:10.087 --> 10:12.089
moved on.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.875
Moved on where?

10:15.005 --> 10:16.311
If you must know,
she got herself a job

10:16.441 --> 10:18.487
as a schoolteacher.

10:18.618 --> 10:22.404
Can you imagine that?

10:22.534 --> 10:24.798
Miss Jones.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.190
Yeah, actually, I can.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.975
-Oh, is that right?
-Mm.

10:28.105 --> 10:30.107
You didn't think for a second
she was too beautiful

10:30.238 --> 10:31.979
just to waste her life
as a teacher in a school?

10:32.109 --> 10:34.982
Ain't a waste, Jesse.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.332
She was always a teacher.

10:37.462 --> 10:40.074
Shit, I think she taught me
and you more than we even know.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.946
Jesus Christ. What do you
figure you can learn

10:43.077 --> 10:45.906
from a teacher in school
you can't find out for yourself?

10:50.301 --> 10:54.131
Pretty much everything.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.411
-Let's go, boys!

11:13.542 --> 11:17.459
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hup, hup.

11:17.589 --> 11:21.071
Hyah! Hyah!

11:49.099 --> 11:51.101
-Hup, hup, hup!

11:58.152 --> 12:00.241
Hey ya! Hey!

12:00.371 --> 12:03.331
Come on!
Push 'em up! Let's go!

12:13.645 --> 12:16.344
Hup, hup!

12:16.474 --> 12:17.954
Whoo!

12:21.088 --> 12:24.004
Hup, hup!
Come on, keep pushing, boys!

12:26.223 --> 12:28.225
-Push 'em up!
-Hyah, hyah!

12:28.356 --> 12:29.574
Push 'em. Let's go!

13:20.190 --> 13:22.236
-Come on, boys!

13:22.366 --> 13:24.281
You treat these
ladies nice, you hear?

13:27.545 --> 13:29.417
Let's go.
Get outta there!

13:39.557 --> 13:41.385
Come on, ladies. Here we go.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.433
Okay, it's on me, boy?

13:52.179 --> 13:53.571
Who's up? Who's up?

13:53.702 --> 13:54.834
-Who is it?
-I'm up!

13:54.964 --> 13:56.444
Think you can go in
again if you want!

13:56.574 --> 13:57.967
All right, all right.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.276
Hey, hey, hey.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.539
And that's your fuck you.

14:04.669 --> 14:06.410
Aw, you're just raisin'
all of us, okay.

14:06.541 --> 14:07.324
-Come on!
-What do you got?

14:07.455 --> 14:08.630
Whoa, whoa!

14:08.760 --> 14:10.284
What do you got?
What do you got?

14:10.414 --> 14:11.676
-Hey, Kid.

14:11.807 --> 14:14.027
Why don't you watch where
you're walkin' next time?

14:14.157 --> 14:16.681
I'm all right.

14:16.812 --> 14:19.510
Oh, yeah, big Billy.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.643
Got your face
on all the posters.

14:21.773 --> 14:24.428
Shut the fuck up, Olinger.

14:24.559 --> 14:27.301
Hey, you don't tell me
what to do, boy.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.172
Now, everyone thinks
you're something special.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.218
You ain't special.

14:31.348 --> 14:33.133
I ain't never seen anything
special about you.

14:33.263 --> 14:35.265
All right,
then let's fight it out.

14:35.396 --> 14:38.225
I ain't fightin' you with a gun.

14:38.355 --> 14:41.489
You ain't that important.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.407
Then let's fight
with our fuckin' fists,

14:46.537 --> 14:49.062
like men.

14:51.368 --> 14:54.502
Yeah?

14:54.632 --> 14:56.286
-I'll beat your ass any day.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.332
Here we go, boys.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.463
Oh, hell, boys.
Watch out! A fight!

14:59.594 --> 15:01.509
-Oh, here we go, boys.
-Uhh!

15:01.639 --> 15:03.163
Hey!

15:03.293 --> 15:05.078
-Whoo!
-Come on, Billy.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.297
Come on, Billy!
Come on, Billy!

15:09.256 --> 15:10.910
-Come on, Billy!

15:17.612 --> 15:20.223
All right, Billy, come!
Come on now!

15:22.182 --> 15:23.183
-Get up, Billy.

15:23.313 --> 15:24.053
Come on, get up, get up,
get up!

15:25.663 --> 15:27.796
Get up, man.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.406
-Get him, Billy.

15:32.235 --> 15:33.323
Hey, Bob!
He's getting you!

15:35.499 --> 15:37.327
-Get him, Billy!

15:37.458 --> 15:41.331
Come on, Billy,
you can do it! Come on, Billy!

15:46.510 --> 15:48.121
Aah!

15:54.605 --> 15:57.130
Get up, Olinger!
Get the fuck up!

15:57.260 --> 15:58.522
Finish him!

15:58.653 --> 16:01.569
Boys...we got a winner!

16:09.794 --> 16:12.623
No hard feelings, Olinger?

16:34.602 --> 16:36.169
Mind if I join you?

16:36.299 --> 16:38.127
Happy days.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.132
Sláinte.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.485
Sláinte.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.150
You mind if I ask you something?

17:05.589 --> 17:07.374
Jesse told me
a little bit about you.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.898
He said that somethin'...

17:10.029 --> 17:16.383
somethin' bad happened way back,
but he didn't know what.

17:20.430 --> 17:25.870
I married this...
beautiful young woman.

17:26.001 --> 17:30.397
Her name was Juanita Gutierrez.

17:30.527 --> 17:33.661
We were head over heels in love.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.576
Mad for it.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.362
But she died...

17:39.493 --> 17:41.843
giving birth.

17:41.973 --> 17:46.065
And so did the baby.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.373
Sorry.

17:58.033 --> 18:01.341
-Hey, Billy.
-Huh?

18:01.471 --> 18:02.864
You're getting
pretty famous now.

18:02.994 --> 18:06.607
I mean, your face
is in a lot of places.

18:06.737 --> 18:09.566
-People talk about you.
-That don't mean nothing to me.

18:09.697 --> 18:14.484
Well, if I was that famous,

18:14.615 --> 18:16.530
it sure would mean
somethin' to me.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.445
Well, that depends
what you get famous for.

18:18.575 --> 18:20.621
Mm.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.797
I sure as hell don't want to be
famous for killing people.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.541
It's more than that.

18:27.671 --> 18:30.109
What is it?

18:32.807 --> 18:35.766
I don't know that I know yet.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.681
Then you got no business
talking about it.

18:45.167 --> 18:48.388
I don't see any
of Chisum's cowboys.

18:48.518 --> 18:50.651
This feels like a trap.

18:50.781 --> 18:51.956
They're driving the herd
to market tomorrow,

18:52.087 --> 18:53.741
so we gotta do this now.

18:53.871 --> 18:56.309
Let's go.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.670
-Hup, hup.
-Hyah!

19:09.800 --> 19:11.324
Come on up!

19:11.454 --> 19:14.109
Hyah! Hup, hup, hup.

19:24.815 --> 19:27.775
Hup, hup!

19:27.905 --> 19:30.299
Whoo!

19:39.917 --> 19:44.008
Hup! Hup, hup, hup!

19:44.139 --> 19:45.532
Watch that side, Pat.

19:45.662 --> 19:46.707
Here cattle, yup.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.491
Yah!

19:50.798 --> 19:52.887
Hup, hup, yip!

19:53.017 --> 19:55.585
-Yah! Come on, now!
-Yip, yip, yip!

19:58.153 --> 19:59.546
-It's Chisum's boys!

19:59.676 --> 20:01.896
Shoot back at him!

20:02.026 --> 20:02.940
He's on the ridge!

20:03.071 --> 20:04.333
Hey, boys!

20:05.465 --> 20:06.814
Hey, boys!

20:06.944 --> 20:08.990
-Shit!

20:16.998 --> 20:21.872
Boys, get ahead of
the herd! Get ahead of the herd!

20:22.003 --> 20:24.875
-Olinger! Get up there!

20:35.756 --> 20:38.889
Go, go! Let's go, boys!
Yah, yah!

20:39.020 --> 20:42.415
Let's go, boys!
Come on! Let's go!

20:55.210 --> 20:57.952
Let's get out of here, boys!
Come on!

20:58.082 --> 20:59.780
Billy, come on!

21:01.869 --> 21:03.479
Hup, hup!

21:33.117 --> 21:34.597
No need to shoot me again.

21:34.728 --> 21:39.950
I'm dying.

21:40.081 --> 21:42.997
I'm not gonna shoot you.

21:43.127 --> 21:45.173
Why did you have to do it?

21:45.304 --> 21:49.438
Why do you have to rob
and kill people like me?

21:55.792 --> 21:58.578
Can't you speak?

22:42.186 --> 22:43.100
We made the papers, boys.

22:46.408 --> 22:51.239
"A vile collection of desperados
in West Texas,

22:51.370 --> 22:54.111
known as the Seven Rivers Gang,

22:54.242 --> 22:58.377
has been brazenly stealing herds
from cattle king John Chisum,

22:58.507 --> 23:02.163
spreading bloodshed and terror
across the state.

23:02.293 --> 23:04.034
A recent shootout
between the gang

23:04.165 --> 23:05.819
and some of Chisum's cowboys

23:05.949 --> 23:08.387
resulted in the deaths
of five men,

23:08.517 --> 23:12.869
including Chisum's
young nephew, a lad of 17.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.699
Little is known about the gang
or their whereabouts.

23:16.830 --> 23:21.095
But one member of the gang
is reputed to be...

23:21.225 --> 23:24.011
the infernal...

23:24.141 --> 23:28.537
William H. Bonney."

23:34.413 --> 23:36.763
"Wanted for a murder
of a blacksmith in Arizona

23:36.893 --> 23:38.721
and a card dealer in Mexico,

23:38.852 --> 23:41.245
Bonney is a desperado
of the worst type.

23:41.376 --> 23:45.075
He is by nature
as well as by education

23:45.206 --> 23:47.164
reckless of his own life

23:47.295 --> 23:50.124
and perfectly regardless
of those of others.

23:50.254 --> 23:52.387
Thrown into often-occurring
danger and adventures

23:52.518 --> 23:56.217
in an early period of his life,
and his training...

23:56.347 --> 23:58.437
left to the force
of circumstances,

23:58.567 --> 24:00.221
it is no wonder
that he is today considered

24:00.351 --> 24:04.007
one of the most dangerous
and lawless individuals

24:04.138 --> 24:06.096
in the United States.

24:06.227 --> 24:08.882
Texas Rangers are hunting
the scoundrels,

24:09.012 --> 24:11.188
moving relentlessly
on their likely hideouts."

24:14.235 --> 24:16.890
Well, I reckon they're
gonna find us, boys.

24:19.066 --> 24:20.850
So it's time we get
ready to clear out.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.390
Come on, Morris.
Hit that thing.

26:06.521 --> 26:09.393
Come on, Beckwith!

26:09.524 --> 26:11.613
Come on.

26:13.136 --> 26:14.703
Come on, Mark!

26:16.226 --> 26:17.184
-That's it, that's it!
-Yep, yep!

26:17.314 --> 26:19.882
-Billy!

26:20.013 --> 26:22.102
-We got company, boys!

26:22.232 --> 26:23.930
-Boys!
-Go, go!

26:28.325 --> 26:32.373
Jesse! It's me, Baker!

26:32.503 --> 26:34.854
Hey, hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

26:34.984 --> 26:37.944
I know 'em! I know 'em!
They're friends.

26:39.380 --> 26:42.209
Boys, allow me to introduce
a very old friend of mine,

26:42.339 --> 26:44.951
-Frank Baker.

26:45.081 --> 26:48.345
Sure am happy to see all of you.

26:48.476 --> 26:51.000
Me and Jesse go back a while.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.089
We've always talked about
going into business together.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.613
That's why I'm here.

26:56.310 --> 26:59.356
We have an opportunity
for you boys,

26:59.487 --> 27:02.229
opportunity for us all to make
a great deal of money,

27:02.359 --> 27:04.492
as well as having some fun.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.972
You know, I know you need
to quit this place.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.496
I read the papers.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.935
I understand you got
William Bonney here with you.

27:13.066 --> 27:14.894
Yeah. I'm here.

27:24.033 --> 27:26.993
It sure is a real pleasure
to meet you.

27:27.123 --> 27:29.082
We've all heard a lot about you.

27:32.433 --> 27:33.913
Let's go inside.

27:42.748 --> 27:46.534
The plan, boys, is for us
to join forces and ride across

27:46.665 --> 27:49.624
the Pecos River and head on in
to Lincoln County.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.192
You know anything
about Lincoln County?

27:52.322 --> 27:55.630
It's still a pretty wild place.

27:55.761 --> 27:59.329
Most important thing is there's
no real law in Lincoln County.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.114
-They got a fort

28:01.244 --> 28:02.463
and a handful of soldiers,
but most of the law

28:02.593 --> 28:04.508
comes from the barrel of a gun.

28:04.639 --> 28:06.206
There's a big player in Lincoln.

28:06.336 --> 28:08.077
His name's
Lawrence P. Murphy.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.732
He owns stores, he owns cattle,

28:10.863 --> 28:13.517
he supplies Fort Stanton
and the reservation offices

28:13.648 --> 28:16.433
there with grain, cattle,
horses, everything you need.

28:16.564 --> 28:19.045
Naturally, he wants
to protect his operation.

28:19.175 --> 28:21.134
And that's where we come in.

28:21.264 --> 28:23.440
His cattle regularly
gets stolen,

28:23.571 --> 28:26.226
and he's got criminal types
moving in from Santa Fe

28:26.356 --> 28:30.709
and elsewhere tryin' to muscle
in on his other businesses.

28:30.839 --> 28:34.060
So, he needs his own people
to discourage them,

28:34.190 --> 28:36.889
and he's prepared
to pay good money to get 'em.

28:37.019 --> 28:39.848
What do you say?

28:42.372 --> 28:44.810
Oh, I think we could probably
help him out. Right, boys?

28:49.510 --> 28:50.337
And, Billy...

28:53.166 --> 28:55.951
I need to know
where you stand in all this.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.518
If you agree to join us,

28:57.648 --> 28:59.346
I guarantee Murphy's
gonna hire us.

28:59.476 --> 29:01.652
And I'll tell you
something else.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.133
We'll make sure you get
the biggest slice of the cake

29:04.264 --> 29:06.005
when it comes time
for remuneration.

29:06.135 --> 29:08.572
Just...wait a minute there,
Frank.

29:08.703 --> 29:11.053
Well, Billy's name alone
is worth that.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.403
This is my gang.
These are my boys.

29:13.534 --> 29:15.623
You got to understand, Jesse.
It's just not the same.

29:15.754 --> 29:19.148
Calm down, Jesse.

29:22.064 --> 29:23.239
You know he's right.

29:25.372 --> 29:28.331
I'm William H. Bonney.

29:28.462 --> 29:30.246
The reason you came here,
right, Mr. Baker?

29:32.640 --> 29:36.513
So, from now on,
if people want my services...

29:36.644 --> 29:38.124
they're gonna have
to pay for 'em.

29:38.254 --> 29:40.474
Simple as that.

29:43.259 --> 29:46.175
Now, sit down, Jesse.

30:19.426 --> 30:22.646
Hey, boys! Came across
this Mexican kid in town.

30:22.777 --> 30:25.519
Kid said he's looking
for William Bonney.

31:15.351 --> 31:18.180
Hey, what's he saying?

31:18.311 --> 31:21.227
He's saying that a friend
of mine is in jail

31:21.357 --> 31:26.362
in Chihuahua, needs my help.

31:26.493 --> 31:30.584
We're setting out for Lincoln.
It's all arranged.

31:42.726 --> 31:45.468
You can all go ahead.
I'll meet you there.

31:45.599 --> 31:46.556
This won't take long.

31:52.388 --> 31:57.089
Billy, you believe this kid?

31:57.219 --> 31:59.091
He's a Mexican.

31:59.221 --> 32:00.440
They're all liars.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.790
He ain't lyin', Jesse.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.923
You know I don't feel the same
way about 'em as you do.

32:05.053 --> 32:06.359
You're entitled
to your opinion, Billy,

32:06.489 --> 32:09.449
but you're wrong.

32:09.579 --> 32:12.234
You know, I've heard you say
the same shit about us Irish.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.586
The men who ran
my father outta town,

32:16.717 --> 32:20.199
put him out of business,
they were Irish.

32:20.329 --> 32:22.462
And I never held that
against you.

32:32.602 --> 32:34.822
Sorry you won't be
riding with us.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.258
I'll be right behind you.

32:36.389 --> 32:38.565
I hope so.

32:41.742 --> 32:44.223
Jesse told me he's known you
a long time,

32:44.353 --> 32:46.747
and by a lot
of different names--

32:46.877 --> 32:50.577
Kid Antrim,
William H. Bonney.

32:50.707 --> 32:54.407
Just "The Kid."

32:54.537 --> 32:56.235
Damn it all,
after all you've done,

32:56.365 --> 32:58.977
you still look
like a kid to me. So...

32:59.107 --> 33:02.763
that's what I'm going
to call you from now on.

33:02.893 --> 33:04.504
I'm gonna call you
"Billy the Kid."

33:07.028 --> 33:08.987
It has a nice ring to it,
don't it?

33:11.946 --> 33:13.295
It's all right.

33:16.733 --> 33:17.865
I'll see you in Lincoln, Pat.

33:20.781 --> 33:22.000
Hyah!

35:31.607 --> 35:33.348
-Shh.

35:52.541 --> 35:55.631
Finished?

35:55.762 --> 35:57.416
Okay.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.862
Don't fucking look at me.

37:26.809 --> 37:28.637
Billy, you came.

37:28.768 --> 37:32.250
I had to.
You're in here 'cause of me.

37:39.735 --> 37:40.736
How many are there usually?

37:40.867 --> 37:41.650
Three.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.266
You seem different.

38:24.780 --> 38:28.654
You aredifferent.

38:41.797 --> 38:47.325
Hyah! Hyah! Hah!

38:50.893 --> 38:53.461
Hyah! Hyah!

39:21.228 --> 39:24.623
-Jesus.
-Segura.

40:20.679 --> 40:21.941
Segura.

41:20.739 --> 41:22.436
I'm sorry.

41:22.567 --> 41:25.744
Things always seem
to end up this way.

41:29.225 --> 41:31.184
It's not your fault, amigo.

41:31.314 --> 41:34.970
I wish I could believe
that things could change...

41:35.101 --> 41:37.669
people could change.

41:37.799 --> 41:40.062
My mother believed that.

41:40.193 --> 41:42.195
I believe it too, Billy.

41:48.157 --> 41:51.944
I'm gonna change.

41:52.074 --> 41:53.859
I owe it to Jesus,
I owe it to my father,

41:53.989 --> 41:55.121
and I owe it to you.

42:04.043 --> 42:05.914
You know we can't
ride on together.

42:06.045 --> 42:11.050
They'll be looking
for the two of us.

42:11.180 --> 42:12.878
I'm gonna miss you.

42:13.008 --> 42:14.662
Me, too, amigo.

42:14.793 --> 42:19.014
No.
