00:40.757 --> 00:42.217
Go fuck yourself,
you son of a bitch. Bastard!

00:44.386 --> 00:45.991
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

00:46.026 --> 00:47.597
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.

00:47.639 --> 00:49.182
Thy will be done, you fuck!

00:49.348 --> 00:52.813
Give us this day our daily bread, as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

00:53.105 --> 00:54.606
Jesus,
Jesus the Nazarene.

00:55.065 --> 00:57.234
Jesus, the nazarene.
Go to hell. Go to hell. Go to hell.

00:57.269 --> 00:59.778
Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell!
Hell! Hell!

01:00.779 --> 01:03.406
Jim, you're not going to waste
the whole day lying around, are you?

01:03.441 --> 01:06.582
Ma, I'm up.
The loony alarm went off.

01:06.617 --> 01:09.912
Well, close the blinds. Don't look
at her and don't listen to her.

01:09.954 --> 01:10.788
How could I not?

01:11.497 --> 01:13.589
Jesus the Nazarene.

01:13.624 --> 01:15.757
Mary the whore.
Mary the hairdresser.

01:15.792 --> 01:17.502
Mary the hairdresser.
Our Father, Who art...

01:17.544 --> 01:18.607
Hey, lady!

01:18.642 --> 01:19.671
Shut up!

01:27.556 --> 01:30.309
When I was young, about 8 or so,

01:30.392 --> 01:32.401
I tried making friends with God-

01:32.436 --> 01:35.272
by inviting him to my house
to watch the World Series.

01:36.690 --> 01:38.066
He never showed.

02:18.397 --> 02:21.570
Too bad, Father.
I was just starting to enjoy myself.

02:24.197 --> 02:27.617
We can do it again tomorrow
if you like, Mr. Carroll.

02:42.756 --> 02:44.890
You okay, Jim?
Does it hurt?

02:44.925 --> 02:46.426
You want to
rub it for him, Pedro?

02:47.093 --> 02:49.599
Jim, give it a rest.
You'll never beat him.

02:49.634 --> 02:50.763
The guy's a pervert.

02:50.798 --> 02:51.857
Did you hear him?

02:51.892 --> 02:53.978
"We can do it again tomorrow
if you like, Mr. Carroll. "

02:54.728 --> 02:56.105
Let's cut out of here.
Come on.

03:06.739 --> 03:08.289
# I was born in a pool #

03:08.324 --> 03:10.263
# They made my mother stand #

03:10.298 --> 03:11.980
# I spat on that surgeon #

03:12.015 --> 03:13.652
# And his trembling hand #

03:13.687 --> 03:15.365
# When I felt the light #

03:15.400 --> 03:17.160
# I was worse than bored #

03:17.195 --> 03:18.920
# I stole a doctor's scalpel #

03:18.955 --> 03:20.755
# And I slit the cord #

03:21.131 --> 03:23.806
# I was a Catholic boy #

03:23.841 --> 03:26.219
# I was redeemed through pain #

03:26.254 --> 03:27.928
# Not through joy #

03:31.140 --> 03:32.662
# I was two months early #

03:32.697 --> 03:34.149
# They put me under glass #

03:34.184 --> 03:36.019
# I screamed and cursed their children #

03:36.054 --> 03:37.538
# When the nurses passed #

03:37.573 --> 03:39.194
# I was convicted of theft #

03:39.229 --> 03:40.780
# As I slid from the womb #

03:40.815 --> 03:42.483
# They led me straight from my mother #

03:42.518 --> 03:45.027
# To a cell in the tombs #

03:45.736 --> 03:48.052
# I was a Catholic boy #

03:48.087 --> 03:50.369
# Redeemed through pain #

03:50.404 --> 03:51.912
# Not through joy #

03:54.915 --> 03:55.880
# They starved me for weeks #

03:55.915 --> 03:57.667
# They thought
they'd teach me fear #

03:57.702 --> 03:59.419
# I fed on cellmates' dreams #

03:59.454 --> 04:01.250
# It gave me fine ideas #

04:01.285 --> 04:03.012
# When they cut me loose #

04:03.047 --> 04:04.861
# The time had served me well #

04:04.896 --> 04:06.675
# I'd made allies in heaven #

04:06.710 --> 04:08.851
# Comrades in hell #

04:08.886 --> 04:11.763
# I was a Catholic child #

04:11.798 --> 04:17.683
# The blood ran red #

04:17.718 --> 04:23.325
# The blood ran wild ##

04:23.360 --> 04:26.537
Why, you little prick!
This is my new...

04:26.572 --> 04:28.782
Shit, guys, gotta get outta here.
I threw up on somebody.

04:28.817 --> 04:29.908
I'll get ya!

04:36.873 --> 04:37.874
You little prick!

04:40.543 --> 04:43.045
I'll fucking throw you
in the fucking river if i catch ya-

04:57.937 --> 04:59.104
Hey!

05:02.608 --> 05:05.360
What about the four of us
versus Wilt Chamberlain?

05:05.395 --> 05:06.653
He was the greatest of all time.

05:06.688 --> 05:07.369
Four of us?

05:07.404 --> 05:08.536
What are you gonna do, Pedro?

05:08.571 --> 05:09.864
tie his shoes together
when he ain't looking?

05:10.365 --> 05:13.159
All right... How'bout the three
versus Wilt Chamberlain?

05:13.194 --> 05:14.663
No problem.

05:14.830 --> 05:15.748
You're kidding,
right, Mickey?

05:16.582 --> 05:18.959
No. He can't cover all of us
at the same time.

05:19.626 --> 05:21.093
You guys don't miss open jumpers.

05:21.128 --> 05:23.004
And you know who will be there
for the rebounds.

05:23.421 --> 05:26.132
Rebounds?
That freak is, like, 7 feet tall.

05:26.966 --> 05:28.509
Jim, I can rebound with anybody.

05:29.302 --> 05:31.762
You're sniffing too much of that shit,
that's what you're doing.

05:31.797 --> 05:34.365
Chamberlain would destroy all of us.
End of story.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.417
Alright. All we got to do
is move the ball around.

05:36.452 --> 05:38.435
There's no way we don't win.
Will you tell this kid?

05:39.811 --> 05:41.021
Hey, Mickey, I think you could
beat him yourself.

05:41.056 --> 05:42.782
I don't think you need us.

05:42.817 --> 05:44.986
Perfect example... confidence.
I know I could beat him.

05:45.611 --> 05:46.862
Holy shit! Look at this place.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.074
I tell you what,
if our school was this nice,

05:50.109 --> 05:51.033
I'd go more than once a week.

05:51.283 --> 05:52.284
You?

05:54.828 --> 05:56.413
We got a game today, gentlemen.

05:56.788 --> 05:58.540
Who's ready to play
some roundball?

05:59.666 --> 06:01.709
I said, who's ready
to play some ball?

06:02.502 --> 06:04.135
You give me that laid-back,

06:04.170 --> 06:06.762
"I'm doing my own thing, Jack"
attitude out there today,

06:06.797 --> 06:09.758
and you're going to find yourself
watching the game from the bench.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.932
No smoking, Iggy...
stunts your growth.

06:14.599 --> 06:16.643
You want to be big and strong
like me, don't you?

06:16.678 --> 06:17.811
Out.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.230
No smoking,

06:22.148 --> 06:23.941
and no pulling your peckers
before a game.

06:25.818 --> 06:28.445
Swifty, do you mind?
I'm taking a dump. Get outta here!

06:29.738 --> 06:30.989
Something die in there?

06:31.615 --> 06:32.289
<i>When we play our game...</i>

06:32.324 --> 06:34.457
- so Pedro vomits
on his head, right?

06:34.492 --> 06:37.954
It goes all over his hair,
trickles down his neck.

06:37.989 --> 06:39.289
Some gets in his eye.
He went nuts-

06:39.324 --> 06:41.335
Don't lie about it, either.

06:41.370 --> 06:43.128
What are you doing?

06:43.545 --> 06:44.838
We're signing a ball for Bobby.

06:44.873 --> 06:46.173
Can I sign?

06:46.548 --> 06:47.674
Yeah.

06:54.847 --> 06:58.517
"We're holding
your spot for you, kid.

06:59.143 --> 07:00.269
Swifty. "

07:01.687 --> 07:02.771
All right.

07:04.565 --> 07:06.024
This one's for Bobby.

07:06.608 --> 07:08.193
All right.

07:11.115 --> 07:12.492
Who's better than we are?

07:12.527 --> 07:13.875
Nobody!

07:13.910 --> 07:15.786
Alright! Go ahead.
Do some warm-ups.

07:15.828 --> 07:17.392
Pedro, you're in charge.

07:17.427 --> 07:18.956
You're my eyes and ears.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.752
- Hey, Jim?
- Yeah?

07:26.046 --> 07:27.964
That's a nice thing
you're doing for Bobby.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.883
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.

07:31.634 --> 07:32.809
You seen Neutron?

07:32.844 --> 07:36.639
I think he's talking to a scout from Saint
John's, as a matter of fact, upstairs.

07:37.848 --> 07:39.561
You want to play
college ball, don't you?

07:39.596 --> 07:41.605
Yeah. Someday, I hope.
You know.

07:42.272 --> 07:43.488
Yeah.

07:43.523 --> 07:45.275
Scouts are sniffing
you out already.

07:45.310 --> 07:46.568
They like them young.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.029
I'll tell you what.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.491
You come by sometime, and
we'll go over the schools together.

07:54.950 --> 07:56.458
Yeah. All right.

07:56.493 --> 07:59.329
Yeah. We'll get a pizza,
and we'll make a night of it.

08:00.997 --> 08:03.583
Um... actually, my nights are
kind of busy right now.

08:05.376 --> 08:06.419
Yeah.

08:06.711 --> 08:07.879
Homework
and all, huh?

08:07.914 --> 08:09.425
Yeah. Yeah.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.264
We were the hottest Catholic
high school team in New York City,

08:15.299 --> 08:17.682
on our way to the championship.

08:18.391 --> 08:20.226
We felt like nothing could stop us.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.154
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

08:25.189 --> 08:26.691
Yes!
We're on our way.

08:26.726 --> 08:28.147
We're on our way.

08:28.182 --> 08:29.533
Let's go.
Let's go.

08:29.568 --> 08:31.195
Hands up.
Show me some defense.

08:31.230 --> 08:32.578
Show me
some defense.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.573
Good steal.
Put it in. Put it in.

08:34.740 --> 08:35.831
Yeah!

08:38.705 --> 08:40.164
All right. All right.

08:40.198 --> 08:41.999
Way to go.

08:43.208 --> 08:44.884
Aw, geez.

08:44.919 --> 08:47.379
All right, Neutron.
Yes! Yes!

08:47.414 --> 08:48.464
To the hole, Jim.

08:51.374 --> 08:53.135
What's going on?

08:54.511 --> 08:56.144
Break it up!

08:56.179 --> 08:58.598
Come on. Hit him!
Beat that motherfucker!

09:03.535 --> 09:05.521
<i>He fucking held me!</i>

09:05.688 --> 09:06.858
This dude blows the whistle...

09:08.610 --> 09:10.028
Slow it down!
Slow it down!

09:36.931 --> 09:38.515
You got to have presence
on the court...

09:39.099 --> 09:41.226
presence like a cheetah
rather than a chimp.

09:41.685 --> 09:42.651
They both got it,

09:42.686 --> 09:45.105
but chimpy got to jump
his nuts around all day to get it.

09:45.939 --> 09:48.858
Shy cheetah just moves
in total nonchalance

09:49.734 --> 09:52.779
a sec or two in his sexy, slow strut.

09:53.321 --> 09:55.740
Me, I play like a cheetah.

10:04.206 --> 10:05.502
<i>Let's go, Rangers-</i>

10:05.537 --> 10:06.085
let's go!

10:06.461 --> 10:08.671
Let's go, Rangers, let's go!

10:15.135 --> 10:16.178
Yeah! Ooh!

10:31.817 --> 10:34.072
You got it!
It's ours. It's ours.

10:41.718 --> 10:42.795
Yeah!

10:42.830 --> 10:43.956
9, 8,

10:43.991 --> 10:44.933
7,

10:44.968 --> 10:45.880
6,

10:45.915 --> 10:46.896
5,

10:46.931 --> 10:47.779
4,

10:47.814 --> 10:48.512
3,

10:48.547 --> 10:49.421
2,

10:49.456 --> 10:50.261
1!

10:50.296 --> 10:52.388
Yay, Jim!
Oh, shit.

10:52.423 --> 10:54.174
That's my team!
That's my team!

10:57.177 --> 10:59.095
There's only two things
Swifty forbids...

10:59.130 --> 11:01.303
using the word "motherfucker"

11:01.338 --> 11:03.477
and stealing from the other team,

11:03.512 --> 11:05.229
as long as they're white.

11:05.771 --> 11:07.356
How much for that
group of winners over there?

11:07.391 --> 11:08.941
It's $34.90.

11:08.976 --> 11:10.400
$34.90?

11:11.234 --> 11:12.778
Changed the prices
or something?

11:13.111 --> 11:13.987
No.

11:17.657 --> 11:19.117
I'm a little short.

11:19.450 --> 11:21.417
Do me a favor.
Here. Take my watch,

11:21.452 --> 11:23.913
and I'll come back later
with the rest of the money.

11:25.956 --> 11:27.082
No.

11:27.666 --> 11:28.709
What do you mean, no?

11:28.959 --> 11:29.967
I'm sorry, sir.

11:30.002 --> 11:32.173
Those burgers are worth
more than the watch is.

11:33.049 --> 11:34.384
I'll be right back.

11:36.761 --> 11:38.763
I told you one burger each,
didn't I?

11:39.472 --> 11:42.850
It takes at least eight of these
to get filled up.

11:42.885 --> 11:44.598
Yeah. C'mon, Swifty.
We're growing boys.

11:44.633 --> 11:46.311
Growing boys?
We're hungry motherfuckers.

11:47.771 --> 11:48.737
Funny, huh?

11:48.772 --> 11:50.482
I'm not driving you guys home.

11:50.517 --> 11:52.108
How's that for laughs?

11:58.406 --> 12:00.366
You ripped them off,
didn't you?

12:07.083 --> 12:08.258
We're even now.

12:08.293 --> 12:09.836
Swifty, come on. How are
we going to get home?

12:09.871 --> 12:11.546
Face the music, pricks.

12:14.131 --> 12:16.008
What are we going to do?
They got the door blocked off.

12:16.043 --> 12:17.443
You afraid of these pussies?

12:17.478 --> 12:18.844
I ain't afraid of anybody.

12:24.933 --> 12:26.024
What's the problem?

12:26.059 --> 12:28.269
I'm going to ask you
this once. All right?

12:28.304 --> 12:30.316
Where's the stuff you stole from me?

12:30.858 --> 12:32.985
What are you
talking about?

12:33.611 --> 12:35.744
No, no, no. You're not going
to fuck with me, all right?

12:35.779 --> 12:39.324
Now, somebody stole my father's
ring from my locker, motherfucker.

12:39.908 --> 12:41.451
You want me to cut you?
Is that what you want, there?

12:42.494 --> 12:43.620
There's no problem here.

13:08.312 --> 13:09.813
Hey, guys! Let's
get out of here, c'mon!

13:10.522 --> 13:13.275
You need a fucking army, huh?

13:13.901 --> 13:15.902
Come on! Come on!

13:27.371 --> 13:28.542
Oh. Nice.
That from Bobo?

13:30.377 --> 13:32.129
That's his father's ring.

13:34.923 --> 13:37.967
Hey, fellas.
Any of you looking for a date?

13:38.426 --> 13:39.976
Yeah. Me, sweetheart.

13:40.011 --> 13:41.804
Little horsy ride
in Central Park,

13:41.839 --> 13:42.888
maybe candlelight dinner?

13:43.764 --> 13:46.100
Why don't we skip right
to dessert, huh, baby?

13:46.135 --> 13:47.650
About $15?

13:47.685 --> 13:50.604
Fifteen bucks? I'll give you a quarter.
Let Pedro suck your tits.

13:51.438 --> 13:53.273
You don't have to be rude.

13:53.308 --> 13:54.858
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:55.191 --> 13:57.757
How about you, handsome, huh?

13:57.792 --> 14:00.324
You got $15... for a little head?

14:01.492 --> 14:03.660
Diane, do I look like
I need to pay for it?

14:03.695 --> 14:05.221
Yeah...

14:05.256 --> 14:06.747
you do.

14:07.164 --> 14:08.874
If it's worth it.

14:08.909 --> 14:10.507
Jimmy...

14:10.542 --> 14:14.128
Jimmy, I know you want some, honey.

14:15.171 --> 14:19.258
$15. I'll do you so good
you'll never forget it, baby.

14:19.842 --> 14:20.885
Hey, hey!

14:20.920 --> 14:22.052
Ooh!

14:23.095 --> 14:23.894
That's a deal.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.556
Bargain from there.

14:26.476 --> 14:28.520
What do you say, guys?
You want to do it? All four of us?

14:29.395 --> 14:30.271
- Yeah.
- It's a deal.

14:30.306 --> 14:31.356
All four of us.

14:33.733 --> 14:35.776
Aw, shit. This is all I got, Diane.

14:37.862 --> 14:38.946
Here, have a pretzel.

14:39.822 --> 14:41.615
- Get out of here.
- Beat it.

14:41.650 --> 14:42.908
Yeah, fuck you!

14:43.909 --> 14:46.328
Fucking dopehead.
You see what that shit does to you?

14:47.329 --> 14:48.962
Wow. Speaking
of dopeheads,

14:48.997 --> 14:51.833
is that Pedro's mother over there
slinging her wares again?

14:55.798 --> 14:56.924
It is!

14:58.759 --> 15:00.177
Hey, Peepee,
where you going?

15:00.802 --> 15:02.721
Why do you have to be
such an asshole all the time, huh?

15:03.555 --> 15:05.688
Why is the little shoe
crying anyway?

15:05.723 --> 15:07.892
His mother's a sneaker.
His father's a loafer.

15:08.434 --> 15:10.144
Somebody's got to be a heel.

15:12.229 --> 15:13.355
Jim, where you going?

15:14.857 --> 15:15.983
Hey, Jim!

15:18.777 --> 15:20.035
Jim.

15:20.070 --> 15:21.780
Hey. Hey, man.

15:22.405 --> 15:23.281
What's up?

15:23.490 --> 15:25.578
You don't recognize me
with my new hairdo?

15:25.613 --> 15:28.330
It's nice. It's nice.
I like it.

15:29.165 --> 15:30.172
What's going on?

15:30.207 --> 15:31.667
- How are you?
- Good.

15:32.334 --> 15:34.586
Wow. Look at that.

15:34.621 --> 15:35.719
You like it?

15:35.754 --> 15:37.804
Yeah, I'll tell you what.
When you get out of here,

15:37.839 --> 15:39.966
we'll all shave our heads and
look like a gang of skinheads.

15:40.383 --> 15:41.467
It's a deal.

15:41.509 --> 15:42.308
All right.

15:42.343 --> 15:43.886
I got something
for you here.

15:43.921 --> 15:44.762
Yeah.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.765
Everyone on the team.

15:48.307 --> 15:50.476
Look right here...
even Swifty signed it.

15:51.352 --> 15:52.686
Thanks, man.

15:55.191 --> 15:58.736
You remember when I dunked on
that spade in Riverside Park?

15:58.771 --> 16:00.822
You always had good ups.

16:01.197 --> 16:02.156
Yeah.

16:02.698 --> 16:04.867
Oh. I got something to
show you. Hold on.

16:04.909 --> 16:06.035
What?

16:09.371 --> 16:11.331
Pedro got these
out of some lady's purse.

16:14.751 --> 16:17.378
- She's doing it with a donkey.
- Oh, Jesus!

16:17.413 --> 16:19.255
Look at that schlong.
Look at that one.

16:20.089 --> 16:21.716
Oh, I beat your record.

16:22.425 --> 16:23.887
How many times
you choke it?

16:23.922 --> 16:25.093
Seven times.

16:25.128 --> 16:26.551
Bullshit.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.939
Seven times.

16:27.974 --> 16:29.649
My mom thinks I have
a cold year-round

16:29.684 --> 16:31.853
because of all the tissues
around the house.

16:40.611 --> 16:42.488
You can keep those
if you want.

16:43.405 --> 16:45.949
They're pumping
so much junk in me,

16:45.984 --> 16:48.493
I can't even get
a decent chubby.

16:54.126 --> 16:55.503
I got an idea.

16:58.213 --> 16:59.840
Come on. Let's go.

17:00.424 --> 17:01.508
Where we going?

17:01.925 --> 17:03.301
I'm getting you out of
this place, man. C'mon!

17:04.176 --> 17:06.637
What are you, crazy, man?
I can't go anywhere.

17:06.673 --> 17:08.223
Here you go.

17:08.640 --> 17:12.143
I've known Bobby since I was 3.
He's my best friend.

17:12.977 --> 17:15.146
He was the best player
on our basketball team.

17:15.181 --> 17:17.565
Two years ago,
he got leukemia.

17:18.398 --> 17:20.108
He keeps fighting it off.

17:20.818 --> 17:22.405
I know Bobby's
going to beat it.

17:23.198 --> 17:24.949
He could beat anything.

17:25.825 --> 17:27.035
Watch!

17:29.120 --> 17:31.372
Jim, you're going
to kill me, man.

17:31.407 --> 17:33.040
If you let go,
I swear...

17:34.250 --> 17:36.001
I swear
I'll kill you, man.

17:36.668 --> 17:37.878
Watch the bump!

17:38.253 --> 17:40.262
What the hell happened
to forty deuce?

17:40.297 --> 17:43.883
Last time I was here, that theater
was playing Sperminator II.

17:43.918 --> 17:45.301
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.

17:46.302 --> 17:49.347
No, man. This whole block has been
done over by all these new artists.

17:49.972 --> 17:51.060
It's pretty cool, huh?

17:51.095 --> 17:52.352
Yeah.

17:54.771 --> 17:56.690
They should put
your stuff up there.

17:58.191 --> 17:59.484
Yeah. Right.

18:00.318 --> 18:03.196
Still scribbling stuff in that
notebook of yours, ain't you?

18:03.821 --> 18:05.156
Of course.

18:06.282 --> 18:07.783
You bring anything for me?

18:08.617 --> 18:09.660
What, like to read?

18:09.952 --> 18:11.453
No, like to eat.

18:11.488 --> 18:12.955
What do you think?

18:13.705 --> 18:17.424
Yeah. I mean, I got this,
but it's not a big deal.

18:17.459 --> 18:20.047
I don't even remember writing it,
to tell you the truth.

18:20.082 --> 18:22.842
Yeah, Yeah. I'll be
the judge of this.

18:25.719 --> 18:27.638
"Little kids shoot marbles

18:28.222 --> 18:30.307
"where branches break the sun

18:31.183 --> 18:33.059
"into graceful shafts of light.

18:39.607 --> 18:41.526
I just want to be pure.

18:48.869 --> 18:50.370
All right.

18:52.288 --> 18:53.831
# What a life #

18:55.583 --> 18:58.085
Nothing like the real thing to
float your boat, huh, Bobby?

18:58.120 --> 18:59.128
# What a life #

19:03.757 --> 19:06.176
# Didn't know where,
didn't know when... #

19:07.135 --> 19:08.428
That's nice.

19:08.970 --> 19:11.556
# Said that I'll go...
go learn #

19:11.591 --> 19:14.107
# Put up my hand,
wait my turn #

19:14.142 --> 19:16.269
# But it never comes,
I have to shout out #

19:16.304 --> 19:17.571
# That's life #

19:17.606 --> 19:18.983
# And that's
what it's all about #

19:19.900 --> 19:22.152
# So through the comfort
and the strife #

19:23.070 --> 19:25.488
# What a life... #

19:32.078 --> 19:33.794
Get me out of here, Jim.

19:33.829 --> 19:36.040
What are you talking
about, man?

19:36.916 --> 19:38.521
This was a stupid idea.

19:38.556 --> 19:40.127
I don't feel so good.

19:43.964 --> 19:45.764
Well, can we wait
till the end of the show?

19:45.799 --> 19:48.805
Did you hear what I said?
I said get me the hell out of here!

20:17.125 --> 20:18.460
Hey, Bob, man...

20:19.711 --> 20:22.380
I'm really sorry, you know?
Next time, we'll go somewhere...

20:22.415 --> 20:24.090
Ain't gonna be
no next time, Jim.

20:39.854 --> 20:41.356
I love it this way...

20:41.689 --> 20:45.029
my feet against the tar,
which is soft from the spring heat,

20:45.446 --> 20:48.240
the slight breeze that runs
across your entire body,

20:48.275 --> 20:49.825
especially your crotch.

20:51.159 --> 20:54.544
You feel an incredible power
being naked under a dome of stars

20:54.579 --> 20:58.833
while a giant city is dressed, dodging
cars all around you five flights down.

21:00.793 --> 21:04.296
I don't think of anything
while I'm doing the actual tugging,

21:04.331 --> 21:07.800
least of all the heavy sex fantasies
I have to resort to indoors.

21:09.134 --> 21:11.970
Just my own naked self
and the stars breathing down,

21:13.013 --> 21:14.559
and it's beautiful.

21:15.435 --> 21:17.937
Time sure flies when you're young
and jerking off.

21:20.356 --> 21:23.567
"Camp summer position.

21:23.602 --> 21:25.617
Driver... taxi. "

21:25.652 --> 21:29.739
Hey, that might be good.
You could get your license this summer.

21:30.949 --> 21:32.659
Oh, yeah, Mom.
That sounds really great.

21:32.694 --> 21:35.370
Hey, get your own job,

21:35.703 --> 21:37.503
and if you don't
get it this summer,

21:37.538 --> 21:39.936
you're coming to work
with me at the hotel.

21:39.971 --> 21:42.334
Mom, please. Why are you
so worried about this?

21:42.369 --> 21:43.595
Do I even ask you for money?

21:43.630 --> 21:45.903
No. I'm not worried
about the money.

21:45.938 --> 21:48.141
I want you to have
responsibility.

21:48.176 --> 21:51.095
I don't want you running
around the streets of New York.

21:51.130 --> 21:54.890
Idle time is
the devil's plaything, Jim.

21:54.925 --> 21:56.642
The devil's plaything, huh?

21:58.227 --> 22:01.230
That might be a cool title
for my first book. Thanks!

22:02.314 --> 22:05.275
What are you talking about?
What are you writing?

22:06.401 --> 22:07.527
Here.

22:09.696 --> 22:10.988
Ooh. Um...

22:11.572 --> 22:13.702
Ma, I'm not really that
hungry this morning, alright?

22:13.737 --> 22:15.871
- Come on. You got to eat something.
- I know...

22:15.954 --> 22:16.962
Where you going?

22:16.997 --> 22:18.540
I'm going to shoot
some hoops.

22:19.374 --> 22:21.855
Sometimes I feel like
something's chasing me,

22:21.890 --> 22:24.337
like there's some whacko
on a roof somewhere

22:24.372 --> 22:25.803
who could snuff me out
at any moment.

22:25.838 --> 22:29.300
And I feel this horrible fear.
Will I have time to finish-

22:29.335 --> 22:31.260
the poems breaking loose
in my head?

22:34.638 --> 22:35.813
Hey, white boy,

22:35.848 --> 22:37.648
you ready
for your beating?

22:37.683 --> 22:40.727
Don't let your mouth get you into
something your ass can't handle.

22:41.606 --> 22:43.357
I'll shoot you for it.

22:47.653 --> 22:49.321
So it's going to be
like that, huh?

22:51.240 --> 22:52.498
I...

22:52.533 --> 22:54.242
don't think so.

22:55.994 --> 22:56.918
Yeah!

22:56.953 --> 22:58.579
All right,
so you made one.

22:58.614 --> 23:00.206
Big deal.
You made one shot.

23:00.241 --> 23:01.381
Make another.

23:01.416 --> 23:04.981
# The days are muzzled
in a vibe #

23:05.016 --> 23:08.785
# I swing back
from time to time #

23:08.820 --> 23:12.519
# There's a Camaro,
rusty red #

23:12.554 --> 23:16.453
# That all
my best friends drive in #

23:16.488 --> 23:20.318
# Can you smell
the summer air? #

23:20.353 --> 23:24.482
# Take me where
they left the light on #

23:24.517 --> 23:27.627
# Getting close,
almost there #

23:27.662 --> 23:30.737
# If that fuzzy silver badge #

23:30.772 --> 23:34.783
# Don't greet us there #

23:37.493 --> 23:40.256
# My head's dizzy,
and I'm taking... ##

23:40.291 --> 23:42.668
Yo, Jim! What's the score?
Come on. We got to go.

23:42.703 --> 23:43.919
They don't keep score
in this game.

23:45.254 --> 23:47.464
Jim, come on.
We're losing the sun.

23:51.176 --> 23:53.511
He's being a dick. You want me
to put a charge in his ass?

23:53.546 --> 23:54.310
Whatch this.

23:54.345 --> 23:55.430
Oh, look it, right here...

23:57.723 --> 24:01.018
Jim's secret diary
he's always writing in.

24:01.053 --> 24:03.228
Bet you he wrote
some shit about me.

24:05.606 --> 24:06.773
Oh, right here.

24:07.024 --> 24:08.275
"Spring... Mickey. "

24:09.028 --> 24:12.205
Hey, there I am, Jim says.

24:12.240 --> 24:15.096
"Mickey takes out a bottle
of carbonic cleaning fluid

24:15.131 --> 24:17.953
and suggests we do
a little sniffing to get high. "

24:18.495 --> 24:19.461
Whoo!

24:19.496 --> 24:23.166
"After four deep whiffs,
we're sailing someplace else. "

24:23.201 --> 24:24.685
Mickey,
what are you doing?

24:24.720 --> 24:26.134
"Bells ringing
through my ears,

24:26.169 --> 24:28.505
little lights
flashing through my eyes. "

24:28.540 --> 24:30.548
Mickey, put that down,
all right?

24:30.583 --> 24:31.848
"I pictured myself

24:31.883 --> 24:33.933
"paddling across a river
with black water,

24:33.968 --> 24:36.435
"only the canoe was going
backwards instead of forwards,

24:36.470 --> 24:40.185
"with clouds that had faces.
Laughing, spooky, fun-house laughs... "

24:40.220 --> 24:42.246
- Give it back, alright?
- What is that shit?

24:42.281 --> 24:44.272
Why do you have to be
such a schmuck, Mickey?

24:44.307 --> 24:45.405
What are you
talking about?

24:45.440 --> 24:47.817
Don't you ever touch that again.
It's private.

24:49.151 --> 24:50.527
What's your problem?

24:50.562 --> 24:51.904
I'm... I'm sorry.

24:52.863 --> 24:56.283
He's writing about me,
I can't read about it? Jesus!

24:56.318 --> 24:57.993
Hey, Jim, come on.
We're gone.

24:58.028 --> 24:59.459
Yo, we got a cab!

24:59.494 --> 25:01.580
Hey, cabby! Hey, swami!

25:01.615 --> 25:03.588
So, Shakespeare,

25:03.623 --> 25:05.124
you going to finish the game?

25:05.833 --> 25:08.005
C'mon, Reggie, you know
this game never ends.

25:08.756 --> 25:10.007
See you later,
all right?

25:12.259 --> 25:15.554
Every crowd has its little games
to prove if you're a punk or not.

25:16.346 --> 25:18.313
My cousin in Jersey
plays chickie,

25:18.348 --> 25:20.600
which is two cars
heading towards each other

25:20.635 --> 25:22.393
at about 80 miles per hour.

25:23.102 --> 25:26.105
First driver to swerve
out of the way is, of course, chicken.

25:27.898 --> 25:28.823
In Brooklyn,

25:28.858 --> 25:31.026
they make you press
a lit cigarette into your arm

25:31.061 --> 25:33.195
and have it burn all the way
down to the filter

25:33.230 --> 25:35.447
without the slightest flinch.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.126
Us, Manhattan boys,

25:38.161 --> 25:40.837
we jump off cliffs
into the Harlem River,

25:40.872 --> 25:45.167
which is literally shitty, because half a
million toilets flush into it every day.

25:45.334 --> 25:47.044
Whoo-oo!

25:48.455 --> 25:50.505
Yeah!

25:53.174 --> 25:54.446
Oooh!

25:54.481 --> 25:55.718
Yeah!

25:56.761 --> 25:57.929
Hey, y'all, I carried the clothes up,

25:57.964 --> 25:59.889
but I ain't carrying them down.

25:59.924 --> 26:01.022
Peepee, this is you...

26:01.057 --> 26:03.309
all 33 pounds of you,
gone with the wind.

26:06.064 --> 26:07.781
Wow. That's
a long way down.

26:07.816 --> 26:11.569
Devil's toe is no big deal.
We've all done it a million times.

26:12.403 --> 26:13.780
I never done it.

26:14.322 --> 26:15.615
You never did it?

26:17.575 --> 26:18.993
Pedro, you never
do nothing.

26:20.327 --> 26:21.835
You know who was awesome
on this rock?

26:21.870 --> 26:24.581
Bobby. That kids would do
back flips off this rock.

26:25.999 --> 26:26.875
Hey, Mickey.

26:28.043 --> 26:29.169
What?

26:29.586 --> 26:31.212
Don't talk about him
like he's dead.

26:32.088 --> 26:33.256
He's not dead.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.014
There goes the circle line.
Check it out.

26:41.933 --> 26:42.649
Whoo!

26:42.684 --> 26:43.518
Full moon!

26:43.553 --> 26:44.870
Whoo!

26:44.905 --> 26:46.109
Hey, yo!

26:46.144 --> 26:47.278
Whoo!

26:47.313 --> 26:48.856
Hey, circle this!

26:52.151 --> 26:53.736
Hey, I'm going.
Watch out, watch out...

26:53.771 --> 26:55.321
I'm going to show you
how to do it.

26:55.696 --> 26:58.907
Ye-ea-ah!

27:10.421 --> 27:11.714
That was a good jump.

27:11.749 --> 27:12.882
Oh, he's nuts.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.060
Hey, I'm going
to walk down.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.096
What you talking about?
You can't walk down.

27:20.131 --> 27:21.765
There's no way
to walk down.

27:21.800 --> 27:22.897
I ain't jumping.

27:22.932 --> 27:25.310
Pedro, your clothes are down there.
How you gonna get your clothes?

27:25.345 --> 27:27.103
You going to walk around
naked all day?

27:27.687 --> 27:30.170
Pedro, if you don't jump,
Mickey's going to tease you so bad-

27:30.205 --> 27:32.653
You might as well just jump
and get it over with. Feel better.

27:34.613 --> 27:36.114
What the hell, right?

27:40.403 --> 27:41.595
shit...

27:41.630 --> 27:42.752
Pedro!

27:42.787 --> 27:43.913
Bad form.
Bad form.

27:43.948 --> 27:46.714
Oh... My God!

27:46.749 --> 27:48.479
Oh, shit. Is he all right?

27:48.514 --> 27:50.210
Pedro,
you all right?

27:52.379 --> 27:53.714
You ready?

27:53.749 --> 27:54.930
Yeah.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.681
Listen, don't tell
the other guys,

27:56.716 --> 27:58.927
but when we leave here,
I got a surprise for you.

27:58.962 --> 28:00.602
Tell me what it is.

28:00.637 --> 28:03.559
It's a surprise. Trust me, all right?
Ouch, don't mess around, man...

28:04.685 --> 28:06.186
Alright, you ready?
Come on! You ready?

28:06.221 --> 28:08.772
- Let's jump.
- On three. Ready?

28:10.190 --> 28:11.358
1,

28:11.691 --> 28:12.859
2,

28:13.401 --> 28:14.444
3.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.081
Come on. Let's go.

28:30.837 --> 28:32.213
What's up, Manny?
How you doing?

28:32.248 --> 28:33.673
Fine.
Thank you, sir.

28:34.382 --> 28:35.758
This is
my friend Jim.

28:35.793 --> 28:36.599
How you doing?

28:36.634 --> 28:38.844
I can't believe
I hit my head on that rock.

28:38.879 --> 28:40.179
It's killing me.

28:56.736 --> 28:58.510
Jim, um,
this is Winkie.

28:58.545 --> 29:00.284
- Hi.
- How you doing?

29:00.319 --> 29:01.618
Good.

29:03.703 --> 29:05.754
And this...

29:05.789 --> 29:07.457
this is Blinkie.

29:08.333 --> 29:09.375
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:10.084 --> 29:13.191
# I lost my heart #

29:13.226 --> 29:16.298
# Under the bridge #

29:17.424 --> 29:18.509
# That little girl... #

29:18.675 --> 29:20.636
I've seen you
play ball, Jim.

29:21.261 --> 29:23.638
You're a very
beautiful player.

29:24.514 --> 29:26.481
Very zen.

29:26.516 --> 29:28.226
# And now I moan #

29:28.268 --> 29:31.982
# And now I holler #

29:33.150 --> 29:35.027
# She'll never know #

29:36.778 --> 29:39.698
# Just what I found #

29:40.657 --> 29:42.916
# That blue-eyed girl #

29:42.951 --> 29:45.912
It'll make you
fuck like Superman.

29:45.947 --> 29:46.788
# She said no more #

29:48.581 --> 29:51.437
Faster than
a speeding bullet...

29:51.472 --> 29:54.259
# Became blue-eyed whore... #

29:54.294 --> 29:57.005
More powerful
than a locomotive...

29:57.040 --> 29:58.108
# Down by the water #

29:58.143 --> 29:59.177
# Down by the water... #

29:59.594 --> 30:01.929
Able to, um...

30:03.473 --> 30:06.559
I can't think of anything
with a single bound.

30:07.143 --> 30:09.541
# See her again #

30:09.576 --> 30:11.939
# See her again... #

30:20.989 --> 30:22.365
Do you have
any protection?

30:22.400 --> 30:23.407
Yeah.

30:26.494 --> 30:29.958
This one's, uh, ribbed
for extra pleasure.

30:33.128 --> 30:34.713
So what are you
waiting for?

30:34.748 --> 30:36.214
What do you mean?

30:37.632 --> 30:39.634
Take off
your clothes.

30:41.552 --> 30:42.887
Well...

30:43.971 --> 30:45.681
could we shut off
the lights first?

30:46.098 --> 30:48.496
# Little fish, big fish #

30:48.531 --> 30:50.713
# Swimming in the water #

30:50.748 --> 30:52.718
# Come back here, man #

30:52.753 --> 30:54.828
# Give me my daughter #

30:54.863 --> 30:56.863
# Little fish, big fish #

30:56.898 --> 30:58.863
# Swimming in the water ##

31:00.614 --> 31:03.450
White ship disappears in the
wave machine this morning.

31:04.660 --> 31:07.120
Your eyes got shut
with secret chains

31:08.413 --> 31:10.707
that pillow armies
eventually set free...

31:13.251 --> 31:15.837
like soft horses
through toy deserts.

31:34.607 --> 31:35.858
I love this mansion,

31:36.984 --> 31:39.153
though it's
too many windows...

31:40.362 --> 31:42.406
to open halfway
each morning...

31:44.282 --> 31:46.284
to close halfway
each night.

33:00.069 --> 33:01.529
I looked at his body,

33:02.196 --> 33:04.531
and it was death
for the first time.

33:06.033 --> 33:09.077
His face was thin and wrinkled,
almost apelike.

33:09.995 --> 33:13.290
His hair, just gray patches
on his scalp.

33:14.207 --> 33:17.794
He looked 60 years old,
and he was 16.

33:18.711 --> 33:21.047
Couldn't believe
how skinny he was...

33:21.297 --> 33:24.094
much skinnier than he was
in the hospital.

33:25.762 --> 33:29.432
It was like having the skeleton of someone
you knew put right in front of you.

33:32.769 --> 33:37.356
I felt dazed, like I'd just come out
of a four-hour movie I didn't understand.

33:39.525 --> 33:41.610
I kept thinking
about his face...

33:43.237 --> 33:44.529
and death...

33:45.072 --> 33:47.657
what a cheat the
whole thing was.

33:49.367 --> 33:50.625
Hey, you guys remember
that Halloween

33:50.660 --> 33:53.256
when Bobby filled that
paper bag with dog shit,

33:53.291 --> 33:55.668
lit it on fire and put it outside
Father Dunne's door,

33:55.703 --> 33:57.461
and we all hid
behind the dumpster?

33:57.496 --> 33:58.420
Yeah.

33:59.296 --> 34:00.554
I could picture
Father Dunne

34:00.589 --> 34:03.967
comming outside, stepping on that shit.
Picture him in the john-

34:04.002 --> 34:05.635
scraping the shit
off his shoe like this.

34:07.428 --> 34:09.451
You think that'll
keep him out of heaven?

34:09.485 --> 34:11.474
Are you kidding?
Jesus Christ himself

34:11.681 --> 34:14.393
would have laughed at that.
It was hilarious!

34:14.428 --> 34:16.183
What about the time
at the formal

34:16.217 --> 34:17.938
when Bobby got caught
in the bathroom

34:17.973 --> 34:20.074
with Mary Ann Dugan

34:20.110 --> 34:22.487
and McNulty came in
and busted him?

34:22.522 --> 34:24.193
He was, like,
"Father, I swear.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.830
We weren't
doing anything. "

34:25.864 --> 34:27.533
Meanwhile she's got
a giant wad of cum

34:27.568 --> 34:29.368
hanging off her face.

34:30.828 --> 34:33.496
I tell you, that kid
was definitely a pisser.

34:35.748 --> 34:37.215
It was weird
seeing him today, man.

34:37.250 --> 34:41.087
He was all shriveled up and wrinkled.
He looked like my grandfather.

34:43.130 --> 34:44.799
I'll tell you what,
though.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.467
That kid was
in so much pain,

34:46.502 --> 34:48.552
it's better off
he died.

34:52.141 --> 34:53.768
How the hell
would you know, Mickey?

34:56.103 --> 34:57.605
Did you go
and visit him?

35:00.984 --> 35:02.777
Any of you guys
go and visit him?

35:06.363 --> 35:08.324
All right.
Then shut the fuck up.

35:08.907 --> 35:12.077
Hey, Jim. Look at my brother's
girlfriend in the park.

35:12.112 --> 35:13.335
She's sitting there, eating a sandwich.

35:13.370 --> 35:14.830
Next thing you know,
she's shot in the head.

35:14.865 --> 35:16.581
She's dead.
It's over.

35:16.831 --> 35:18.294
What about little Teddy Rayhill?

35:18.329 --> 35:20.052
Perfect example.

35:20.087 --> 35:21.721
Remember that night
he was up on the roof,

35:21.756 --> 35:25.426
and he was doing poppers, having
a great time, laughing his ass off

35:25.461 --> 35:26.642
He started
walking backwards...

35:26.677 --> 35:29.805
Boom! He fell right off
the goddamn roof.

35:30.764 --> 35:32.098
It was meant to be,
right?

35:33.016 --> 35:35.435
Fuck that, you guys!

35:35.602 --> 35:38.521
Bobby was the best fucking
guy around, you know that?

35:39.939 --> 35:41.691
What are you,
a bunch of idiots?

35:44.902 --> 35:46.904
You don't even understand,
do you?

35:59.043 --> 36:00.669
Jim, you all right?

36:06.133 --> 36:09.594
Listen, maybe you should talk
to one of the priests.

36:10.303 --> 36:13.014
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe they can help you out.

36:13.049 --> 36:14.515
Help me out?

36:15.433 --> 36:18.188
I wouldn't ask one of those
cocksuckers for directions.

36:20.148 --> 36:21.573
You know what?

36:21.608 --> 36:24.110
You guys need to
lighten the fuck up, all right?

36:24.145 --> 36:26.488
Let bygones
be fucking bygones.

36:26.523 --> 36:29.073
Shitty fucking world.

36:44.462 --> 36:47.218
Live life to the fucking fullest.
You know what I mean?

36:48.970 --> 36:50.513
Shit happens, man.

36:50.548 --> 36:52.056
Shit fucking happens.

36:56.768 --> 36:58.228
Come on.
Let's go.

36:59.521 --> 37:00.814
Jim, come on.

37:01.314 --> 37:02.781
You're growing up,

37:02.816 --> 37:05.777
and rain sort of remains
on the branches of a tree

37:05.812 --> 37:07.528
that will someday
rule the earth.

37:09.697 --> 37:11.157
And that's good
that there's rain.

37:12.157 --> 37:16.081
Clears the month of your
sorry rainbow expressions.

37:18.416 --> 37:21.377
And it clears the streets
of the silent armies

37:22.420 --> 37:24.046
so we can dance.

37:26.340 --> 37:28.509
# Ted sniffing glue
He was 12 years old #

37:28.550 --> 37:31.178
# Fell from the roof on east 2-9 #

37:31.220 --> 37:33.764
# Cathy was 11
when she pulled the plug #

37:33.805 --> 37:36.600
# 26 reds and a bottle of wine #

37:36.808 --> 37:38.518
# Bobby had leukemia,
14 years old #

37:38.553 --> 37:40.228
# He looked like 65
when he died #

37:40.263 --> 37:41.736
# He was a friend of mine #

37:41.771 --> 37:43.943
# Those are people
who died, died #

37:44.109 --> 37:46.195
# Those are people
who died, died #

37:47.154 --> 37:48.655
# Those are people
who died, died #

37:49.364 --> 37:51.408
# Those are people
who died, died #

37:51.443 --> 37:53.368
# They were all my friends #

37:53.403 --> 37:54.828
# They just died #

37:56.996 --> 37:59.207
# Those are people
who died, died #

37:59.457 --> 38:01.792
# Those are people
who died, died #

38:02.001 --> 38:04.044
# Those are people
who died, died #

38:04.336 --> 38:06.804
# Those are people
who died, died #

38:06.839 --> 38:12.761
# They were all my friends
and they died ##

38:23.941 --> 38:26.818
Did I ever tell you about
the first time I did heroin?

38:33.908 --> 38:35.785
I went down
to Pedro's basement.

38:36.619 --> 38:39.747
All sorts of characters were in the
storage-room shooting gallery.

38:41.081 --> 38:42.752
I was just going to
sniff a bag,

38:43.920 --> 38:45.130
but a guy says,

38:45.839 --> 38:49.717
"If you're going to sniff,
might as well pop it,

38:50.927 --> 38:54.555
and if you're going to pop it,
might as well mainline. "

38:55.723 --> 38:56.807
I was scared of needles,

38:57.266 --> 38:58.976
but I gave in.

39:04.898 --> 39:07.317
It was like a long heat wave
through my body.

39:08.484 --> 39:14.118
Any ache or pain or sadness or guilty
feeling was completely flushed out.

39:35.304 --> 39:39.558
Look, Ma, I'm not in the mood for your
dime-store psychology, all right?

39:39.593 --> 39:41.396
Could you just please
leave me alone?

39:41.431 --> 39:42.653
I got a little sick,
all right?

39:42.688 --> 39:44.822
We're not going to
live like this, Jim.

39:44.857 --> 39:48.319
We're not going to live like this.
I'm warning you! I'm telling you.

39:48.354 --> 39:49.451
Oh, God, Mom.

39:49.486 --> 39:51.120
You're always warning me,
aren't you?

39:51.155 --> 39:54.324
Blah, blah, blah.
You're always in my fucking ear.

39:54.359 --> 39:57.702
Blah, blah, blah.
You don't know anything.

39:57.737 --> 39:59.127
What are you
talking about?

39:59.162 --> 40:01.331
Go clean toilets or whatever
the hell it is you do.

40:01.366 --> 40:03.207
When you're done,
clean this one.

40:03.791 --> 40:05.174
Don't talk like that!

40:05.209 --> 40:07.211
What's the matter with you?

40:11.051 --> 40:12.767
Gee whiz, Ma,
you know...

40:12.802 --> 40:15.805
we got to have these
heart-to-heart talks more often.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.724
They're really
good for us.

40:18.850 --> 40:19.934
I don't know you.

40:22.394 --> 40:24.730
I don't believe
this is you, Jim.

40:25.856 --> 40:28.073
Please, Jim.
I don't know who you are.

40:28.108 --> 40:31.278
Yeah, I know. I was such
a good little boy, right...

40:31.313 --> 40:33.380
with such potential,
wasn't that it?

40:33.415 --> 40:35.448
Is that what
you're going to say?

40:42.249 --> 40:45.210
Oh, Jim.
What's happening?

40:45.245 --> 40:47.212
Jim, what's happening?

40:48.838 --> 40:51.931
First, it's
a Saturday-night thing,

40:51.966 --> 40:54.969
and you feel cool,
like a gangster or a rock star.

40:55.928 --> 40:58.013
It's just something
to kill the boredom, you know?

40:58.848 --> 41:01.433
They call it a chippie,
a small habit.

41:02.267 --> 41:05.687
It feels so good,
you start doing it on Tuesdays,

41:05.722 --> 41:07.564
then Thursdays.

41:08.818 --> 41:10.194
Then it's got you.

41:10.736 --> 41:12.780
Every wise-ass punk
on the block says

41:12.815 --> 41:13.989
it won't happen to them,

41:14.615 --> 41:15.950
but it does.

41:20.871 --> 41:21.962
Go do it!

41:21.997 --> 41:23.498
I ain't doing it.
I always do it!

41:25.542 --> 41:27.001
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

41:29.587 --> 41:33.299
Excuse me, ma'am. Could you tell me
the fastest way to the subway?

41:34.133 --> 41:38.431
Yeah. That's the "B" train.
Go to this corner and make a left.

41:38.466 --> 41:39.307
It's right there.

41:39.683 --> 41:41.267
What are you doing?
Let go! Let go!

41:41.976 --> 41:43.728
Let go of that!

41:43.853 --> 41:46.022
Oh, my God!
What?

41:47.231 --> 41:49.692
- Help! No! No!
- What are you doing?

41:50.860 --> 41:51.986
Let's go!

42:00.118 --> 42:01.369
Come on!

42:05.456 --> 42:07.002
I don't feel like going in today.

42:09.088 --> 42:12.841
Father, is it all right
if I don't go in today?

42:13.175 --> 42:15.677
Why? What are you
scared of?

42:15.969 --> 42:18.721
Nothing. I just don't
feel like it, that's all.

42:19.097 --> 42:24.018
I imagine you have more to confess
than anybody here.

42:24.053 --> 42:25.686
Unburden yourself.

42:34.986 --> 42:37.540
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

42:37.575 --> 42:41.620
It's been about four months
since my last confession.

42:41.954 --> 42:44.248
Yes, my son?

42:46.166 --> 42:47.918
Well, I don't know
where to start, Father.

42:49.669 --> 42:52.088
Have you taken the name
of Jesus Christ in vain?

42:52.213 --> 42:54.514
Yeah. Yeah, I have.

42:54.549 --> 42:56.634
Have you disrespected
your mother and father?

42:57.885 --> 43:00.513
Have you stolen
or cheated your fellow man?

43:02.681 --> 43:04.309
Yeah, but I'm
not proud of it.

43:04.344 --> 43:06.412
Have you had
impure thoughts

43:06.447 --> 43:08.319
or engaged
in impure deeds?

43:08.354 --> 43:10.156
Oh, Father, you have no idea.

43:10.191 --> 43:13.694
Is there something else that you
want to tell me in your own words?

43:15.321 --> 43:18.073
I've done all kinds
of crazy shit.

43:18.108 --> 43:20.159
Oh, excuse me, Father.

43:20.326 --> 43:21.869
Fuck, I'm s...

43:22.786 --> 43:24.044
Christ, I have
a dirty mouth.

43:24.079 --> 43:25.622
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about that.

43:26.414 --> 43:27.958
Will you just go on?

43:28.583 --> 43:29.834
10 Hail Marys,

43:30.168 --> 43:32.462
five Our Fathers.

43:35.384 --> 43:36.531
What do you mean?

43:36.566 --> 43:37.643
And that's it?

43:37.678 --> 43:39.054
That's my punishment?

43:43.516 --> 43:45.226
You know something?

43:46.186 --> 43:48.688
My friend Bobby,
he was the best,

43:49.313 --> 43:50.898
and he's dead.

43:53.526 --> 43:55.861
This sucks! You know that?
This really sucks.

43:56.570 --> 43:57.905
It's not fair, Father.

44:01.074 --> 44:02.890
Your nose is running,

44:02.925 --> 44:04.671
your stomach cramps,

44:04.706 --> 44:06.881
your legs feel like
they've played

44:06.916 --> 44:09.251
six straight games
on top of each other,

44:09.960 --> 44:12.546
and the voice is always there
in the back of your head...

44:13.338 --> 44:16.466
"Just one more time.
then we'll stop. "

44:36.071 --> 44:39.073
Quick to the ball. Quick to the ball.
Two hands. Good, Ignatius.

44:39.282 --> 44:42.368
Good. Good. Quick to the ball.
Two hands. Right behind you.

44:42.403 --> 44:44.078
Sir, all right if I use
the bathroom, Coach?

44:44.113 --> 44:45.454
Jim, you got a bladder
like a woman.

44:45.489 --> 44:46.539
Let's go. Again.

44:47.373 --> 44:49.083
There we go. Right behind him.

44:49.118 --> 44:49.965
Right behind him.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.877
Quick to the ball.
Two hands. Two hands.

45:20.031 --> 45:21.115
Jim?

45:24.576 --> 45:26.078
I thought you were
taking a piss.

45:27.329 --> 45:28.914
What are you doing in here
every practice?

45:35.464 --> 45:37.174
Have you been
waiting for me, Jim?

45:38.217 --> 45:39.843
Giving me some kind
of a signal?

45:41.887 --> 45:43.931
What are you
talking about, Swifty?

45:45.140 --> 45:46.475
Don't act surprised.

45:53.773 --> 45:55.274
Do we understand
each other?

45:59.364 --> 46:01.575
It's not going to
happen, Swifty.

46:01.610 --> 46:03.076
Put the money away.

46:03.326 --> 46:04.577
You want more?

46:06.371 --> 46:07.997
Here.

46:09.165 --> 46:10.590
Just let me do it.

46:10.625 --> 46:12.752
Get the fuck
out of my face!

46:14.086 --> 46:15.219
Take it easy, Jim.

46:15.254 --> 46:17.172
You can't blame me
for trying.

46:19.299 --> 46:20.467
I made a mistake,
all right?

46:21.510 --> 46:23.602
Let's just pretend
it never happened.

46:23.637 --> 46:26.097
Things will go back to exactly
how they were before.

46:26.132 --> 46:27.348
Okay?

46:27.724 --> 46:30.563
Okay? Here,
keep the money.

46:31.313 --> 46:32.856
Keep the money.

46:33.565 --> 46:35.567
Just don't tell anybody,
all right?

46:38.445 --> 46:40.078
Good. Tell anybody
you want!

46:40.113 --> 46:42.866
Nobody's going to believe
a drughead like you, anyway.

46:42.901 --> 46:44.867
You think we don't know
what you've been doing?

46:49.830 --> 46:51.102
Give me
the fucking money

46:51.137 --> 46:52.339
and get the fuck
out of here.

46:52.374 --> 46:54.334
Get the fuck-
Get the fuck out here!

46:54.543 --> 46:56.336
Come on!
Get out of here!

47:03.638 --> 47:05.765
And you want to stop.
You really do.

47:05.800 --> 47:07.721
But it's like a dream.

47:07.756 --> 47:09.608
You can't stop dreams.

47:09.643 --> 47:12.562
They move in crazy pieces,
any way they want to,

47:12.597 --> 47:16.316
and suddenly,
you're capable of anything.

48:21.131 --> 48:23.300
No!

48:38.567 --> 48:41.611
Wake up, Mr. Carroll!
It's later than you think.

49:02.717 --> 49:03.968
Oh. All right!

49:05.136 --> 49:06.804
- I need a lift.
- All right.

49:06.839 --> 49:08.014
What do you got?

49:08.931 --> 49:11.350
Three different pills.
Which are the ups?

49:12.351 --> 49:14.353
I never asked. I thought
one of youse would know.

49:14.388 --> 49:15.360
Oh, great.

49:15.395 --> 49:17.480
We look like
pharmacists?

49:17.515 --> 49:19.566
I don't know
what to take.

49:19.601 --> 49:20.650
What do we take?

49:20.685 --> 49:21.616
Let me see.

49:21.651 --> 49:23.447
The blacks and the reds
are the ups.

49:25.574 --> 49:27.493
I think the pink ones
are the ups.

49:27.528 --> 49:28.584
Why?

49:28.619 --> 49:31.163
'Cuz I associate pink
with lightness, you know?

49:32.456 --> 49:34.749
The black ones seem like
they'd knock you on your ass.

49:34.784 --> 49:36.543
They might be
faded seconals.

49:37.502 --> 49:38.676
No, they're not faded.

49:38.711 --> 49:40.171
They'd be sticky.
They're not.

49:40.963 --> 49:42.305
That's bullshit.

49:42.340 --> 49:44.175
- Fuck your mother.
- My what?

49:45.176 --> 49:46.517
All right!
Calm down.

49:46.552 --> 49:48.366
Don't ever talk
about my mother.

49:48.401 --> 49:50.731
Don't ever hit me
like that again.

49:50.766 --> 49:53.061
Come on! Alright!
Give me your hat.

49:53.096 --> 49:54.354
We got a game to play, alright?

49:54.389 --> 49:55.938
Just give me something.

49:56.689 --> 49:57.940
Hi, Neutron.

49:57.975 --> 49:59.191
Let me ask him.

49:59.817 --> 50:01.944
Neutron, you know
which ones are the ups?

50:03.988 --> 50:06.740
I think you should put that shit away
before Swifty comes in here.

50:07.574 --> 50:09.493
Why you acting like
such a square ass?

50:09.528 --> 50:11.209
Screw you, Mickey.

50:11.244 --> 50:14.580
Screw you, too,
Tough guy. Man.

50:14.615 --> 50:17.917
I'm just going to
take the black.

50:18.584 --> 50:19.550
You sure?

50:19.699 --> 50:21.597
You got a better idea?

50:21.632 --> 50:24.801
Nope. Your guess
is as good as mine, Jimbo.

50:27.095 --> 50:29.556
It's on today.
50 rebounds.

50:30.140 --> 50:31.689
Good.

50:31.724 --> 50:33.316
Come on.
Let's go.

50:33.351 --> 50:36.110
I'm your friend now,
right?

50:36.145 --> 50:37.646
What, I got to smack
you again, c'mon!

50:43.026 --> 50:44.653
Yeah, take your
little rat with you.

50:46.363 --> 50:47.864
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up?

50:47.899 --> 50:49.240
Why are you
acting like that?

50:49.275 --> 50:51.127
You know what's wrong.

50:51.162 --> 50:53.914
Used to be about getting high
and playing basketball.

50:53.949 --> 50:55.249
Now it's just about
getting high with you.

50:55.284 --> 50:56.674
You're blowing it, Jim.

50:56.709 --> 50:58.877
Oh, come on. I don't need to
hear this from you, Neutron.

50:59.127 --> 51:03.214
Yeah, you do, Jim! Listen, no, Jim!
I'm really proud of you, man.

51:03.249 --> 51:05.550
Everything's cool.
You look great.

51:05.585 --> 51:07.510
I'll see you
in the NBA.

51:45.173 --> 51:47.091
# Riders on the storm #

51:49.930 --> 51:52.099
# Riders on the storm #

51:53.600 --> 51:56.644
# Into this house
we're born #

51:58.479 --> 52:01.399
# Into this world
we're thrown #

52:03.150 --> 52:05.402
# Like a dog
without a bone #

52:05.437 --> 52:08.172
# In fact we're all alone #

52:08.207 --> 52:10.908
# Riders on the storm #

52:12.451 --> 52:15.245
# There's a killer
on the road #

52:16.955 --> 52:20.211
# His brain is squirming
like a toad #

52:22.213 --> 52:25.466
# Take a long holiday #

52:27.175 --> 52:29.719
# Let your children play #

52:31.471 --> 52:33.848
# If you give
this man a ride #

52:33.883 --> 52:36.660
# Sweet family will die #

52:36.695 --> 52:39.437
# Killer on the road #

52:39.472 --> 52:41.272
# Yeah ##

53:10.301 --> 53:11.309
Did you find it?

53:11.344 --> 53:13.429
No, Father. It's clean.
There's no drugs in there.

53:14.388 --> 53:15.313
Thank you, Officer.

53:15.348 --> 53:17.102
I told you
we didn't have nothing.

53:24.692 --> 53:28.029
You boys think you're
awfully smart, don't you?

53:28.064 --> 53:31.449
Well, you're both
suspended for a week!

53:31.484 --> 53:33.492
Ooh...

53:33.576 --> 53:35.953
And you'll never play
basketball here again.

53:35.988 --> 53:37.329
That you can count on.

53:38.121 --> 53:40.290
You can't kick me
off the team, Swifty.

53:40.325 --> 53:42.918
Oh? Why is that?

53:43.918 --> 53:45.882
'Cause I quit the team...

53:48.509 --> 53:51.929
and the school and this whole
faggot-ass scene, that's why.

53:53.972 --> 53:55.890
I could second
that motion.

53:55.925 --> 53:57.809
Your resignations
are accepted!

54:00.645 --> 54:02.647
Neutron, you coming with us?

54:06.484 --> 54:07.908
Yeah. That's
what I figured.

54:07.943 --> 54:10.070
Come on, man.
I'm fucking out of here.

54:14.119 --> 54:16.621
Don't worry, Swifty.
I'm not going to rat you out.

54:20.750 --> 54:22.897
And in the next
life, Father,

54:22.932 --> 54:25.045
I'm going to have the paddle!

54:25.080 --> 54:26.505
Get out!

54:27.673 --> 54:29.591
Thanks a lot,
Neutron.

54:29.626 --> 54:31.134
Thanks, man.

54:44.900 --> 54:47.402
I can't believe this,
you know?

54:47.437 --> 54:49.870
I know.
What happened to the pills?

54:49.905 --> 54:52.497
We got kicked out
of the school, Mickey.

54:52.532 --> 54:54.701
Who cares, man? We lost the pills.
The cops took them-

54:54.736 --> 54:57.120
We can't
play ball anymore.

54:59.288 --> 55:01.213
Jim, who cares
about school, man?

55:01.248 --> 55:04.209
We just lost $40 worth
of pharmaceuticals.

55:05.502 --> 55:07.337
I know what
happened to them, too.

55:07.372 --> 55:09.172
The cops, they take
that all the time.

55:09.714 --> 55:11.969
They either
pop them themselves

55:12.004 --> 55:13.102
or they sell them.

55:13.137 --> 55:15.306
What's my mom going
to say, man? When I go home?

55:16.182 --> 55:17.857
She ain't
gonna say nothing.

55:17.892 --> 55:20.477
You just tell her you're going
to school every day in the morning.

55:20.512 --> 55:22.437
Let's get out
of here, man...

55:25.440 --> 55:27.192
Go get into something.

55:28.610 --> 55:31.487
You never sold any pills
at the schoolyard?

55:31.522 --> 55:32.572
No.

55:32.822 --> 55:36.659
So it's all a big conspiracy
against you. Right, Jim?

55:36.694 --> 55:38.490
Yeah. Maybe it is.

55:38.525 --> 55:40.287
Maybe it's not.

55:40.788 --> 55:42.674
You been missing these?

55:42.709 --> 55:45.795
What are you going to tell me...
they're vitamins?

55:47.255 --> 55:48.965
Oh, fuck you, Ma.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.132
What?!

55:50.716 --> 55:52.391
Get out of my house!

55:52.426 --> 55:54.310
Oh, is that
what you want, Ma?

55:54.345 --> 55:57.688
Get out! You don't
talk to me that way!

55:57.723 --> 56:00.017
If that's what you want,
I'm fucking out of here. All right?

56:00.934 --> 56:02.526
What are you doing?

56:02.561 --> 56:04.319
I'm leaving!
What do you think?

56:04.354 --> 56:06.981
I wan you to take all your shit!
I'll help you. Here!

56:08.733 --> 56:09.692
You want me to leave?

56:09.727 --> 56:10.452
Yes. Get out!

56:10.487 --> 56:12.614
I'm out of here.
Get the fuck out of my way!

56:12.649 --> 56:15.200
This garbage is
going to kill you, Jim!

56:15.235 --> 56:16.375
I'm gone!

56:16.410 --> 56:17.994
Gonna to kill you!

56:22.957 --> 56:26.439
Don't you understand? I can't
watch you kill yourself?

56:26.474 --> 56:29.922
Ma, you're never going to
fucking see me again, alright?

56:29.957 --> 56:31.305
Just remember that.

56:31.340 --> 56:34.009
Don't say that, Jim.
Don't say that!

56:35.302 --> 56:37.179
It was a dream,
not a nightmare...

56:38.555 --> 56:40.560
a beautiful dream
I could never imagine

56:40.595 --> 56:42.228
in a thousand nods.

56:43.729 --> 56:45.237
I saw this girl
next to me

56:45.272 --> 56:48.400
who wasn't beautiful
until she smiled,

56:49.985 --> 56:51.862
and I felt that smile
come at me

56:51.897 --> 56:53.446
and heat waves following,

56:53.905 --> 56:57.492
soaking through my body
and out my fingertips

56:57.527 --> 56:59.160
in shafts of color.

57:00.453 --> 57:01.871
And I knew
somewhere in the world...

57:02.872 --> 57:05.166
somewhere...
that there was love for me.

57:27.773 --> 57:29.316
We just got to
raise enough cash

57:29.351 --> 57:30.734
to keep our heads straight.

57:35.154 --> 57:37.371
Luckily, finding money
in New York

57:37.406 --> 57:40.621
is like getting laid
at the prom... easy.

57:50.588 --> 57:52.972
- Fuck it, Pedro!
- What's the matter with you?

57:53.007 --> 57:56.469
Jesus! Watch the road.
You could kill us all, c'mon!

57:56.504 --> 57:58.352
I get 1,500 bucks
for this car.

57:58.387 --> 58:00.097
If it's whacked up,
it's worth nothing.

58:00.132 --> 58:02.272
We should
buy shit in bulk, man

58:02.307 --> 58:04.434
We'll put it on the street
and make real money.

58:04.476 --> 58:05.859
That's 500 bucks a piece.

58:05.894 --> 58:08.031
We'll be on for days,
nights, weeks.

58:08.066 --> 58:10.443
Yeah, man.
I'd love to go to Puerto Rico,

58:10.478 --> 58:13.112
soak up some rays,
you know?

58:13.147 --> 58:14.453
See my bitch?

58:14.488 --> 58:16.538
That's what
I'd like to do.

58:16.573 --> 58:18.242
- What are you talking about?
- What bitch?

58:18.277 --> 58:19.868
We haven't seen
a picture or nothing.

58:19.903 --> 58:21.710
She's 500 pounds, Jim.

58:21.745 --> 58:23.747
She got a mustache
thicker than her father.

58:23.782 --> 58:26.631
No. That's your
mother, Mickey.

58:26.666 --> 58:29.127
She does not exist.
Don't fool yourself.

58:29.162 --> 58:31.253
Be careful.
I'm about to whack.

58:34.673 --> 58:36.470
Oh, shit, man.

58:40.598 --> 58:42.934
My brother's going to take care
of us and this car.

58:46.020 --> 58:48.439
Pedro,
wake the fuck up!

58:49.231 --> 58:50.322
Pedro, come on, man!

58:50.357 --> 58:52.818
You're going to get us killed,
what are you doing?

58:52.853 --> 58:53.819
I got it, man.

58:54.444 --> 58:55.744
You want me to drive?

58:55.779 --> 58:58.288
Mickey, you better drive the car.
I'm serious, man.

58:58.323 --> 59:01.576
Just don't blow my high. If there's a
scratch in the car, my brother'll kill me.

59:32.482 --> 59:33.608
Yo, get out of the booth!

59:36.781 --> 59:38.157
Get out the booth, huh?

59:39.116 --> 59:40.284
Get out.

59:41.202 --> 59:42.536
Fucking...

59:43.329 --> 59:44.044
What's up? What's up?

59:44.079 --> 59:45.893
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Where's the car?

59:45.928 --> 59:47.708
It's good to see you, too.
It's over here.

59:47.743 --> 59:50.585
It's nice.
It's smokin'.

59:50.620 --> 59:51.760
You tell me that?

59:51.795 --> 59:52.969
It's everything
you wanted.

59:53.004 --> 59:55.173
Get your hands off.
You guys look like shit.

59:55.208 --> 59:57.884
Oh, my God.

59:58.718 --> 01:00:00.261
They're taking the car.

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:01.769
Show me the sign, man!

01:00:01.804 --> 01:00:03.473
Show me
the freaking sign!

01:00:03.508 --> 01:00:05.139
It's right there.
You see?

01:00:05.174 --> 01:00:06.770
It says "tow-away."

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:09.070
You scumbags even read?

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:10.773
I should kick
all your punk asses!

01:00:10.808 --> 01:00:12.073
Goddamn it!

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:13.157
I can get you
another car tonight.

01:00:13.192 --> 01:00:15.569
Yeah? John Halligan is
waiting for this car.

01:00:15.604 --> 01:00:17.036
I got him out
of bed with his wife.

01:00:17.071 --> 01:00:18.614
You know how this
makes me fucking look?

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:19.490
Kenny, get off.

01:00:23.285 --> 01:00:24.870
You're too stupid
to be my brother!

01:00:25.745 --> 01:00:26.621
You're too stupid!

01:00:27.622 --> 01:00:28.957
You want a piece
of me, Carroll?

01:00:28.992 --> 01:00:30.917
Back off! Back off!

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:33.964
- Kenny, no more!
- Mr. Tough Guy.

01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:37.092
- Kenny, no more!
- Huh? Tough guy?

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:47.685
Give me a sip
of your soda.

01:00:57.486 --> 01:00:59.446
You wipe off the bottle
before you take a sip?

01:00:59.738 --> 01:01:02.535
You don't even think twice
about sharing works with Mickey.

01:01:03.619 --> 01:01:05.288
You think you'll catch something
from the bottle

01:01:05.323 --> 01:01:06.831
you're not catch
from a needle?

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:09.416
You mistake me for somebody
who gives a shit.

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:13.093
Headquarters...
home on and off

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:15.130
to every down-and-out
junkie and wino

01:01:15.165 --> 01:01:17.465
from 14th Street
to the Bowery.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.260
It's like a fucking
all-star team.

01:01:20.295 --> 01:01:21.726
Jimmy, the other day,

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:23.513
my mother's been
ragging on me,

01:01:23.548 --> 01:01:25.480
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.850
"You've tried every other way.
Go to church.

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:29.567
Put yourself
in Christ's hands. "

01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:32.691
So I do it, man.
I figure, give it a shot.

01:01:32.726 --> 01:01:33.698
I dig Jesus.

01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:36.986
So, I go, man. High mass...
a choir and everything.

01:01:37.021 --> 01:01:40.239
The first thing I see
on the right, the side altar,

01:01:40.274 --> 01:01:43.176
are those little candles
in the red glass

01:01:43.211 --> 01:01:46.078
that we used when
it was windy in the park

01:01:46.113 --> 01:01:47.121
to cook up.

01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:50.791
And then, this altar boy,
he's coming down the aisle

01:01:50.826 --> 01:01:52.841
with this 6-foot candle.

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:56.553
I envision this
huge spoon above it, man,

01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:59.677
with, like, shopping bags
full of dope inside of it.

01:01:59.712 --> 01:02:01.894
And then the kicker
comes, man.

01:02:01.929 --> 01:02:04.598
The priest, he starts doing
the thing with the incense.

01:02:04.633 --> 01:02:06.481
You know,
starts wafting out.

01:02:06.516 --> 01:02:08.685
I'm in the back.
It finally hits me.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.854
"Where do I know
this smell from, man?

01:02:10.889 --> 01:02:12.987
My room, man. "

01:02:13.022 --> 01:02:15.365
It's the smell exactly

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:18.694
of really primo dope
cooking up.

01:02:18.729 --> 01:02:20.119
Yeah?

01:02:20.154 --> 01:02:23.163
Exactly the same.

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:25.033
So what
happened next?

01:02:25.068 --> 01:02:26.868
At that point, I split.

01:02:26.903 --> 01:02:28.161
I went home,

01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:32.050
I went inside my closet,

01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:35.171
I got my stash out
of the inside pocket

01:02:35.206 --> 01:02:38.132
of my sharkskin
easter suit,

01:02:38.841 --> 01:02:42.094
and I got stoned.

01:02:42.129 --> 01:02:43.842
Ba bing...

01:02:43.877 --> 01:02:45.555
ba bang.

01:02:47.807 --> 01:02:49.684
I love a ritual.

01:02:52.437 --> 01:02:54.605
Oh, Mary, if you can hear me...

01:02:56.690 --> 01:03:01.531
I need you to fill
Jim's heart with love

01:03:01.566 --> 01:03:04.993
because he really
needs it now.

01:03:09.705 --> 01:03:11.290
Oh, God...

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.794
please watch over my son.

01:03:17.504 --> 01:03:19.881
He needs you now.

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:25.553
Just take care of him, okay?

01:03:25.588 --> 01:03:27.266
I'll be okay.

01:03:37.567 --> 01:03:39.861
I love you, Jim.

01:03:39.896 --> 01:03:42.322
I love you.

01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:47.410
Hey, you holding?
You straight, man?

01:03:47.445 --> 01:03:49.161
Get out of here.

01:03:49.196 --> 01:03:49.703
Come on.

01:03:49.738 --> 01:03:51.121
No.

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:04.762
Hey, have you
seen Falco?

01:04:05.137 --> 01:04:08.056
Come on, man.
Are you holding anything?

01:04:08.091 --> 01:04:10.767
Hey, Diane...
Come here, Diane.

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:13.478
- I'll take care of you, babe.
- Yeah?

01:04:13.853 --> 01:04:17.280
Yeah. How about
some of this?

01:04:17.315 --> 01:04:21.277
I wouldn't do you for a bag,
you fucking piece of shit.

01:04:35.334 --> 01:04:37.044
Jim.

01:04:37.079 --> 01:04:38.754
Jimmy.

01:04:41.298 --> 01:04:43.467
You're looking good.

01:04:43.502 --> 01:04:45.636
Who's your embalmer?

01:04:47.054 --> 01:04:49.347
I want some
of what you got.

01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:33.776
Check everything
in this place.

01:05:33.811 --> 01:05:37.940
Wow. I always wanted
to use these syrup pumps.

01:05:41.651 --> 01:05:43.653
And these professional
ice-cream scoopers.

01:05:52.664 --> 01:05:54.333
Oh, my God.

01:06:12.224 --> 01:06:13.607
Don't make me do it!

01:06:13.642 --> 01:06:15.435
I'll do it!
I swear to God!

01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:23.362
Jim, watch out.

01:06:27.699 --> 01:06:29.493
Come on!

01:06:32.037 --> 01:06:33.044
It's not opening.

01:06:33.079 --> 01:06:34.914
They don't make them
like this anymore.

01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:37.000
You got to get it
from the side.

01:06:37.667 --> 01:06:38.772
I got it!

01:06:38.807 --> 01:06:39.877
Oh, cool.

01:06:40.503 --> 01:06:41.983
Change!

01:06:42.018 --> 01:06:43.464
Shit!

01:06:44.048 --> 01:06:45.299
Let's get
out of here.

01:06:46.008 --> 01:06:47.676
It's locked.
We got to go out the back.

01:06:47.711 --> 01:06:49.386
Pedro,
let's get out of here!

01:06:50.765 --> 01:06:52.767
What am I,
hallucinating here?

01:06:52.802 --> 01:06:54.661
Pedro, you'll
get us caught.

01:06:54.696 --> 01:06:56.521
The cops are
going to come.

01:06:59.857 --> 01:07:02.283
Oh, you want to
be tough, huh?

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:06.196
Go ahead... take another sip so I can blow
your fucking head all over the counter!

01:07:06.405 --> 01:07:08.406
Go ahead, Pedro! Go ahead!

01:07:09.074 --> 01:07:10.617
Come on, guys! Let's go.

01:07:10.652 --> 01:07:13.042
Put that gun away!

01:07:13.077 --> 01:07:14.370
Don't fuck with me,
motherfucker!

01:07:14.405 --> 01:07:16.306
What the hell
are you doing, Mickey?

01:07:16.341 --> 01:07:17.983
What the hell
did you do that for?

01:07:18.018 --> 01:07:19.625
Let that little
spic rot, man!

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:20.761
He'll get us caught.

01:07:20.796 --> 01:07:23.382
Jim, the cops are coming.
Come on!

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:25.217
Jim!

01:07:27.218 --> 01:07:28.595
Jim!

01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:30.722
Pedro! Pedro!

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.895
Jim!

01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:41.530
Freeze! Freeze!

01:07:41.565 --> 01:07:43.699
On your stomach!
On your stomach!

01:07:43.734 --> 01:07:46.486
I didn't do anything,
I'm telling you!

01:08:20.939 --> 01:08:22.615
This is it, man.

01:08:22.649 --> 01:08:25.194
That Jew got to keep
the money under his pillow.

01:08:27.947 --> 01:08:30.240
Hey, Jim, I know
you're still mad about Pedro.

01:08:30.274 --> 01:08:31.716
I couldn't
do nothing, man.

01:08:31.752 --> 01:08:33.160
He was going to
get us caught.

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.828
Definitely shouldn't have
went that far.

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:39.499
What happened to you?
Your mother kick your ass?

01:08:41.042 --> 01:08:42.175
Yeah, real funny.

01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:44.377
Bring us a couple of Cokes,
will you?

01:08:46.796 --> 01:08:48.142
You all right?

01:08:48.176 --> 01:08:50.345
Hey, bartender,
move out of the way.

01:08:50.554 --> 01:08:53.555
Jim, I'm getting sick.
I got to get some money to cop.

01:08:57.227 --> 01:08:58.310
Jim.

01:08:58.644 --> 01:09:00.104
You with me here?

01:09:03.274 --> 01:09:04.441
What the hell
are you wa...

01:09:04.475 --> 01:09:06.950
Oh, shit.

01:09:06.984 --> 01:09:08.368
That's Neutron.

01:09:08.403 --> 01:09:10.863
That's the all-American
high school game?

01:09:12.157 --> 01:09:13.867
We could have played
in that game.

01:09:15.743 --> 01:09:17.129
Who gives a shit?
Come on.

01:09:17.163 --> 01:09:19.542
I'm waiting to hear back on a
scholarship from Saint John's...

01:09:19.577 --> 01:09:21.252
I'm not sure about it, but
hopefully it will work out.

01:09:21.292 --> 01:09:23.921
Jim, I'm starting to jones.
Gotta get out there. We need some money.

01:09:25.296 --> 01:09:27.340
Jim, don't dwell on
these dreams, man.

01:09:27.375 --> 01:09:28.425
Will you come on?

01:09:30.926 --> 01:09:34.096
Meet you outside, man.
I'm getting sick.

01:09:34.471 --> 01:09:36.098
You want to meet me
out there?

01:09:36.133 --> 01:09:37.725
Is it okay if I say
hi to my mom?

01:09:38.559 --> 01:09:39.685
Hi, Mom.

01:09:40.352 --> 01:09:42.062
- Thanks.
- Thanks a lot.

01:09:44.857 --> 01:09:52.158
# You don't know it,
but you're coming right along #

01:09:55.119 --> 01:10:02.549
# Please be strong #

01:10:02.584 --> 01:10:11.259
# You don't know it,
but you're coming right along ##

01:10:19.436 --> 01:10:21.021
Hey, you! Stop!
You can't go in there! Stop!

01:10:33.324 --> 01:10:34.164
What do you want?

01:10:34.199 --> 01:10:35.916
You realize
what time it is?

01:10:35.951 --> 01:10:38.245
Yeah. Um... is Winkie
and Blinkie here?

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.539
Who the hell
are Winkie and Blinkie?

01:10:40.574 --> 01:10:41.713
Hey, guys.

01:10:41.748 --> 01:10:43.920
Lisa, Mel,
you know this boy?

01:10:44.337 --> 01:10:45.671
No, Daddy.

01:10:46.547 --> 01:10:47.694
Come on.

01:10:47.729 --> 01:10:48.806
All right.

01:10:48.841 --> 01:10:51.009
Come on.
Get out of here.

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:54.680
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin. He got past me.
- Don't let it happen again.

01:10:54.715 --> 01:10:56.097
It won't happen again.
Get out of here!

01:11:00.143 --> 01:11:01.477
What? What?

01:11:03.646 --> 01:11:04.779
Asshole.

01:11:04.814 --> 01:11:06.989
Hey, fuck-up,
get fucking up, man!

01:11:07.024 --> 01:11:10.069
- What's your problem, man?
- What's YOUR problem, mam?

01:11:10.104 --> 01:11:11.943
You sold my girlfriend
some shit the other day.

01:11:11.978 --> 01:11:14.069
You almost killed her.
What was it... rat poison?

01:11:14.104 --> 01:11:16.161
It's not my fault your girl
can't handle her drugs.

01:11:16.196 --> 01:11:18.461
I want my fucking
$20 back, man.

01:11:18.496 --> 01:11:21.749
Look, there's no money-back guarantees.
I'm not selling refrigerators here.

01:11:22.083 --> 01:11:22.590
Oh, yeah?

01:11:22.625 --> 01:11:25.836
I'll cut you a dynamite
deal on mexican shit.

01:11:25.871 --> 01:11:28.046
Give me my $20,
or we'll go outside.

01:11:29.047 --> 01:11:30.966
If we go outside, one of us
is going to get hurt.

01:11:38.014 --> 01:11:40.391
I told you one of us
would get hurt.

01:11:40.426 --> 01:11:41.434
Is that right?

01:11:52.572 --> 01:11:55.366
It's been hard...
the writing... lately.

01:11:56.617 --> 01:12:01.121
Terrible numbness,
then suddenly it comes...

01:12:02.414 --> 01:12:06.168
in beautiful fragments
or terrible dreams...

01:12:07.294 --> 01:12:08.712
like nods...

01:12:10.588 --> 01:12:12.802
so high.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.460
Reggie, is that you?

01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:31.296
Who the fuck
do you think it is?

01:13:40.474 --> 01:13:41.726
Don't worry,

01:13:42.643 --> 01:13:44.687
you're not dead yet.

01:13:58.658 --> 01:14:00.535
It's not bad.

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:03.871
Hey, give me that.

01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:14.175
How come it's all wet?

01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:17.511
Because you
pissed on it.

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:20.598
I didn't say
you could read this.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.767
What, have you been
digging through all my stuff?

01:14:30.857 --> 01:14:33.526
I need... I got
to get out of here.

01:14:34.861 --> 01:14:36.447
Where's my jacket?

01:14:36.482 --> 01:14:38.033
You're welcome.

01:14:42.829 --> 01:14:44.664
What the hell am I
thanking you for?

01:14:45.123 --> 01:14:48.960
Because you was frozen in the snow
like a goddamn creamsicle.

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:05.728
Where is it?

01:15:07.146 --> 01:15:08.773
What?

01:15:10.107 --> 01:15:13.110
You know what the fuck I'm
talking about, Reggie! Where is it?

01:15:16.446 --> 01:15:18.657
You mean this?

01:15:24.579 --> 01:15:26.080
Give it to me.

01:15:29.083 --> 01:15:32.545
I'll cut your fucking throat, Reggie!
Give it to me, all right?

01:15:33.003 --> 01:15:34.088
Just give it to me!

01:15:44.475 --> 01:15:45.942
Oh, give it to me!

01:15:45.977 --> 01:15:47.478
Give it to me!
I'm serious!

01:15:47.513 --> 01:15:48.979
Give me it!

01:15:50.272 --> 01:15:51.565
Give it to me!

01:15:52.482 --> 01:15:53.734
Goddamn it!

01:16:00.782 --> 01:16:02.665
I'll make you
an incredible offer.

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.205
I'm going to save your life
twice in one day, understand me?

01:16:08.458 --> 01:16:11.253
You should have left me
in the fucking snow, man.

01:16:13.421 --> 01:16:15.590
Give me the money
for my dope, too.

01:16:17.925 --> 01:16:20.761
I'm not gonna suck your dick,
all right? Put that away.

01:16:20.796 --> 01:16:22.596
Who the hell wants you
to suck their dick?

01:16:22.631 --> 01:16:24.271
Goddamn it!

01:16:24.306 --> 01:16:26.558
Look at yourself!
Just look at yourself.

01:16:40.199 --> 01:16:41.950
Oh, Reggie...

01:16:41.985 --> 01:16:43.667
it's okay.

01:16:43.702 --> 01:16:45.460
Why are you doing this?

01:16:45.495 --> 01:16:49.624
Because once upon a time, somebody helped
me, and I always pay what I owe.

01:16:56.338 --> 01:16:57.630
Reggie.

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:02.009
Reggie,
I just need a taste.

01:17:03.347 --> 01:17:06.100
I just need a little
something, Reggie.

01:17:08.359 --> 01:17:10.153
You don't understand.

01:17:10.987 --> 01:17:12.447
It hurts, Reggie!

01:17:20.037 --> 01:17:22.539
Reggie, I got to go.

01:17:22.574 --> 01:17:25.006
I got to go see my mom.

01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:27.627
You got to let me
get out of here, Reggie.

01:17:28.795 --> 01:17:30.546
Reggie!

01:17:31.509 --> 01:17:34.803
It hur...
It hurts.

01:17:37.856 --> 01:17:40.016
Shit!

01:17:42.978 --> 01:17:45.230
Oh, boy...

01:17:51.319 --> 01:17:54.078
# Touch the taste
and taste the smell #

01:17:54.113 --> 01:17:56.740
# Smell the scent, all the gifts
you gave to me, baby #

01:18:00.914 --> 01:18:04.646
# The food of your brain #

01:18:04.681 --> 01:18:08.379
# The room is spinning round #

01:18:08.414 --> 01:18:11.090
# I never come down #

01:18:18.847 --> 01:18:21.266
# The room is spinning round #

01:18:21.301 --> 01:18:24.477
# I never come down... #

01:18:32.529 --> 01:18:33.864
Reggie.

01:18:34.948 --> 01:18:36.581
you got to give me it.

01:18:36.616 --> 01:18:38.993
You got to
give me it, Reggie.

01:18:39.869 --> 01:18:41.961
Please!

01:18:41.996 --> 01:18:44.498
Reggie, come on!

01:19:00.015 --> 01:19:05.604
# I remember you, too #

01:19:07.522 --> 01:19:10.317
# I blew my mind ##

01:19:11.109 --> 01:19:13.778
Wake up.
Can't sleep all day.

01:19:15.988 --> 01:19:17.865
Oh. Thanks.

01:19:29.337 --> 01:19:30.964
Jesus Christ.

01:19:31.756 --> 01:19:33.223
What happened to you?

01:19:33.258 --> 01:19:35.510
What does it look like?
Motherfucker shot me.

01:19:35.545 --> 01:19:37.678
Woke my black ass up.

01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:40.730
Shit.

01:19:40.765 --> 01:19:43.225
Look, uh... I'll be back
in the morning, Jim.

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.817
You just stay cool.

01:19:44.852 --> 01:19:46.276
You start
to get panicky,

01:19:46.311 --> 01:19:49.029
write about me
in that book of yours.

01:19:49.064 --> 01:19:51.358
Actually, I was a little hurt
I wasn't mentioned.

01:19:53.443 --> 01:19:55.467
You really like my writing,
huh, Reggie?

01:19:55.502 --> 01:19:57.456
Damn, man, I told you
four times already.

01:19:57.491 --> 01:20:00.202
What do you want me to do?
Bend over and kiss your ass?

01:20:05.874 --> 01:20:08.341
Hey, Reg,
do me a favor.

01:20:08.376 --> 01:20:10.545
While you're out,
pick me up a bag.

01:20:20.012 --> 01:20:22.431
# The room is spinning round #

01:20:23.473 --> 01:20:27.772
# I may never come down #

01:21:08.062 --> 01:21:09.522
I am alone.

01:21:12.983 --> 01:21:14.276
Not just me.

01:21:15.527 --> 01:21:16.570
We're alone...

01:21:17.904 --> 01:21:19.864
alone forever.

01:21:22.033 --> 01:21:24.747
And who's at the end of that
forever tunnel I run through,

01:21:25.331 --> 01:21:27.958
up Fifth with the wallpaper
of skyscrapers?

01:21:35.715 --> 01:21:38.510
I'm thinking, after all
those beautiful trips,

01:21:41.095 --> 01:21:43.014
that this is one
of those bad ones.

01:21:45.224 --> 01:21:46.517
Diane?

01:21:47.726 --> 01:21:48.977
Hey!

01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:53.443
Jim. Remember me?

01:21:55.403 --> 01:21:56.654
Man, you look great.

01:21:56.689 --> 01:21:58.656
Yeah, thanks.

01:22:00.157 --> 01:22:02.118
Good to see somebody
from the old neighborhood...

01:22:02.153 --> 01:22:04.286
What do you want, Jim?

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:10.166
- You holding anything?
- No.

01:22:10.201 --> 01:22:12.043
Just like
a 5 or something?

01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:14.671
Just to tide me over,
you know?

01:22:15.546 --> 01:22:17.173
Please, Diane?
Come on.

01:22:18.591 --> 01:22:21.220
Yeah. For an old friend?
Why not?

01:22:21.255 --> 01:22:23.782
I've been looking
all over for this.

01:22:23.817 --> 01:22:26.309
Oh, you know what?
I only got a 20.

01:22:27.018 --> 01:22:28.352
A 20 is good.

01:22:28.387 --> 01:22:29.652
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

01:22:29.687 --> 01:22:32.231
A 20 is great, yeah.
That would help me out a lot.

01:22:32.732 --> 01:22:34.233
- You want a 20?
- Yeah.

01:22:34.984 --> 01:22:38.988
Why don't you go buy yourself
some pretzels, you asshole.

01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:42.115
You bitch!
You're nothing but a whore!

01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:44.701
I don't give a shit
about your clothes!

01:22:44.736 --> 01:22:46.626
You're still
a whore to me!

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:51.002
Yeah? Shut up. Look at you.
Oh, are you desperate now, baby?

01:22:51.037 --> 01:22:52.218
Who's a whore now?

01:22:52.253 --> 01:22:54.171
Don't talk to me like that,
you bitch!

01:22:54.406 --> 01:22:56.674
Who's laughing, stupid?

01:22:58.175 --> 01:23:00.719
Don't play a game with me!
I know you!

01:23:08.768 --> 01:23:10.186
Shit.

01:23:10.221 --> 01:23:11.604
Oh, man.

01:23:15.941 --> 01:23:17.151
Shit.

01:25:09.057 --> 01:25:10.356
Mickey.

01:25:10.391 --> 01:25:11.997
Mick,
what's up, man?

01:25:12.032 --> 01:25:13.547
Hey, what's up, man?

01:25:13.582 --> 01:25:15.027
Did you
get anything?

01:25:15.062 --> 01:25:16.523
No, not a dime.
You score?

01:25:16.558 --> 01:25:17.985
Yeah,
I got something.

01:25:18.485 --> 01:25:19.778
What'd you get?

01:25:19.813 --> 01:25:21.036
About 35 bucks.

01:25:21.071 --> 01:25:23.573
35? Where'd you
get it?

01:25:25.366 --> 01:25:27.410
I robbed some fucking asshole
on the "D" train.

01:25:28.244 --> 01:25:31.003
Dude, 35 will keep us on
for, like, two days.

01:25:31.038 --> 01:25:33.895
Well, could we get some stuff, man?
I'm fucking... my head is...

01:25:33.930 --> 01:25:36.752
I see some spics. I think we can score.
You wanna check it out?

01:25:36.787 --> 01:25:40.178
- Yeah, alright.
- Come on. They're over here.

01:25:40.213 --> 01:25:43.008
Why the fuck do we have to cop
on the street all the time?

01:25:43.508 --> 01:25:45.847
My fucking nuts are
itching like crazy.

01:25:45.882 --> 01:25:47.014
Think this is him?

01:25:49.809 --> 01:25:51.310
Is your name Pino?

01:25:52.936 --> 01:25:55.063
Listen... could we
get us some dope?

01:25:55.098 --> 01:25:57.190
The dude over there
said you could help.

01:25:57.225 --> 01:25:59.025
You want to cop some shit?

01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:00.402
Let me see some cash.

01:26:00.437 --> 01:26:01.712
I got it here.

01:26:01.747 --> 01:26:02.952
Let me see.

01:26:02.987 --> 01:26:04.655
Hey, no money
without no taste.

01:26:05.239 --> 01:26:06.998
You want a taste?

01:26:07.033 --> 01:26:10.244
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

01:26:10.279 --> 01:26:11.377
Hurry, man.

01:26:11.412 --> 01:26:12.621
Come on.
There's fucking cops all over.

01:26:12.656 --> 01:26:15.142
That's good, man.
That's good.

01:26:15.177 --> 01:26:17.629
All right, listen...
4 for 35.

01:26:17.664 --> 01:26:19.220
4 for 35, man?

01:26:19.255 --> 01:26:20.506
Come on, man.
$5.00 short.

01:26:20.541 --> 01:26:21.556
What's the big deal?

01:26:21.591 --> 01:26:24.343
Ta bien, chico...
Toma, toma.

01:26:24.378 --> 01:26:26.512
- You got four?
- Yeah.

01:26:28.639 --> 01:26:29.980
We should taste this.

01:26:30.015 --> 01:26:31.516
Where are we
going to cook it up?

01:26:31.551 --> 01:26:32.768
I don't know
about his guy.

01:26:32.803 --> 01:26:34.352
No, he's cool.

01:26:35.812 --> 01:26:36.861
Fuck, man!

01:26:36.896 --> 01:26:38.363
What's the matter?

01:26:38.398 --> 01:26:40.733
- Just taste it! Come on.
- What do you mean? I tasted it.

01:26:42.276 --> 01:26:44.531
He beat us.
He fucking beat us.

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:45.782
I swear to fucking God...

01:26:45.817 --> 01:26:46.748
Put that away!

01:26:46.783 --> 01:26:48.083
I'm gonna
kill this mother-!

01:26:48.118 --> 01:26:49.453
- Come here, motherfucker!
- Put it away!

01:26:54.165 --> 01:26:56.084
I'm going to fucking
kill you, you motherfucker!

01:26:57.543 --> 01:27:00.087
Motherfucker, you're fucking dead,
you hear me?

01:27:33.121 --> 01:27:34.413
Dude, don't
make me do it.

01:27:34.448 --> 01:27:35.331
Where's the money?

01:27:39.668 --> 01:27:39.668
I want the money.
I want the money and the bags.

01:27:39.703 --> 01:27:41.126
Where's
the fucking money?

01:27:41.161 --> 01:27:42.549
The fucking money!
I want it!

01:27:45.969 --> 01:27:48.721
No!

01:27:50.681 --> 01:27:52.892
- Oh, shit!
- We fucking killed him!

01:27:52.927 --> 01:27:54.515
What the fuck
do you mean, we?

01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:56.306
I didn't
fucking touch him!

01:27:56.341 --> 01:27:58.028
Don't put
that shit on me!

01:27:58.063 --> 01:28:01.086
He beat us, man!
He deserved it!

01:28:01.121 --> 01:28:04.110
You went too far, Mickey!
Oh, shit!

01:28:04.319 --> 01:28:05.326
Is he dead?

01:28:05.361 --> 01:28:07.530
Of course he's fucking dead!
He fell six stories!

01:28:07.565 --> 01:28:08.621
Jim, come on.

01:28:08.656 --> 01:28:12.538
Come on! Will you come one?
Jim, don't make me leave you here!

01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:17.751
Oh, shit.

01:28:29.053 --> 01:28:30.221
# Star #

01:28:31.388 --> 01:28:33.515
# I'll reach you if I try #

01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:36.560
# Show me the truth, yeah #

01:28:38.103 --> 01:28:39.312
# Star #

01:28:40.191 --> 01:28:42.151
# I'll reach you if I try #

01:28:44.278 --> 01:28:46.322
# Show me the truth, yeah ##

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:50.826
Come on, get back up!
Come on!

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:05.798
Get off of me!
What are you doing?

01:29:20.272 --> 01:29:21.565
Who is it?

01:29:22.066 --> 01:29:24.777
Ma... let me in.

01:29:27.154 --> 01:29:29.114
Ma, let me in!

01:29:44.714 --> 01:29:46.508
Please, Ma.

01:29:53.598 --> 01:29:56.350
Ma? Hey, Ma?

01:29:57.268 --> 01:29:57.935
Are you in there, Ma?

01:29:59.186 --> 01:30:00.729
Ma, is that you?

01:30:00.764 --> 01:30:02.477
Yeah.

01:30:02.512 --> 01:30:04.191
Ma? Ma?

01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:07.530
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

01:30:07.565 --> 01:30:08.990
Hi.

01:30:11.409 --> 01:30:13.953
Hi, Ma.

01:30:13.988 --> 01:30:16.497
Hi. Hi.

01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:20.834
Listen, I need you to
help me out, all right?

01:30:22.168 --> 01:30:23.753
I need you to
give me some money.

01:30:24.754 --> 01:30:26.631
Okay?

01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:30.009
I need you to give me,
like, five doll...

01:30:30.044 --> 01:30:31.840
Like, $20,
something like that

01:30:31.875 --> 01:30:33.637
because I'm
in some trouble.

01:30:37.144 --> 01:30:38.568
Ma?

01:30:38.603 --> 01:30:40.320
Do you hear me, Ma?

01:30:40.355 --> 01:30:42.941
Yeah, I hear you.
I can't help you.

01:30:42.976 --> 01:30:43.906
Okay, listen,

01:30:43.941 --> 01:30:46.569
what you got to do is give me
some money, okay?

01:30:47.028 --> 01:30:48.696
Jim, I can't do that.

01:30:49.905 --> 01:30:50.913
Why not?

01:30:50.948 --> 01:30:54.284
Mom, you know I'm not
going to do anything with it.

01:30:54.319 --> 01:30:57.621
I just need to go out of town
for a little while

01:30:57.656 --> 01:30:59.164
'cause I got
into some trouble,

01:30:59.199 --> 01:31:00.248
and I need some help.

01:31:01.499 --> 01:31:03.710
Okay? So, you got to
give me some money, Mom.

01:31:04.168 --> 01:31:05.721
Can you hold my hand?

01:31:05.756 --> 01:31:08.015
Yeah, I'll hold your hand.

01:31:08.050 --> 01:31:10.385
Mom, can you give me
some money, please?

01:31:11.637 --> 01:31:13.638
Mom, can you give me
some money, please?

01:31:13.673 --> 01:31:15.598
Stop fucking around!

01:31:15.633 --> 01:31:16.731
I can't.

01:31:16.766 --> 01:31:20.144
Mom, give me some
fucking money, please!

01:31:20.179 --> 01:31:22.563
What are you doing?
I'm your son!

01:31:22.598 --> 01:31:24.030
I don't have any.

01:31:24.065 --> 01:31:26.358
Mom, don't fuck
around like this!

01:31:26.393 --> 01:31:28.152
Give me some money!

01:31:28.187 --> 01:31:29.695
Mom!

01:31:31.405 --> 01:31:35.495
Come on! Let me in
the fucking door!

01:31:37.997 --> 01:31:40.249
Oh, God.

01:31:43.502 --> 01:31:46.421
Oh, fuck.

01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:52.552
Let me in.

01:31:53.678 --> 01:31:56.097
I need some money.

01:31:56.722 --> 01:31:59.016
I need some money
real bad.

01:32:01.927 --> 01:32:04.733
Oh, God.

01:32:05.567 --> 01:32:08.069
Someone's breaking
into my apartment.

01:32:09.195 --> 01:32:10.947
They have a knife.

01:32:12.855 --> 01:32:14.659
Mom!

01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:20.789
You don't understand, Mom.

01:32:21.832 --> 01:32:25.502
You don't know what
you're fucking doing to me.

01:32:27.212 --> 01:32:29.797
Mom, I'm in pain.

01:32:30.715 --> 01:32:35.055
How could you do this
to your son, you bitch?

01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:38.475
You fucking bitch!

01:32:50.528 --> 01:32:53.656
Oh, let me in!

01:32:54.490 --> 01:32:59.453
I'll do anything!
I'll be a good boy!

01:33:00.412 --> 01:33:02.959
I'll be a good boy, mom,

01:33:02.994 --> 01:33:05.711
if you let me in.

01:33:06.587 --> 01:33:08.047
Get off me!

01:33:08.964 --> 01:33:10.382
Get off!

01:33:11.133 --> 01:33:12.134
No!

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:14.720
No!

01:33:16.096 --> 01:33:17.597
You fuckers!

01:33:17.889 --> 01:33:20.183
You're not going to do this!
Fuck you!

01:33:21.059 --> 01:33:23.519
Ma! Don't do this!

01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:25.396
Ma!

01:33:30.651 --> 01:33:32.072
Ma!

01:33:37.577 --> 01:33:38.828
Ma!

01:33:42.123 --> 01:33:44.333
I got six months
in Riker's Island

01:33:44.875 --> 01:33:47.544
for assault, robbery,

01:33:48.337 --> 01:33:51.173
resisting arrest,
and possession of narcotics.

01:33:52.174 --> 01:33:54.182
I sweated out
a horrible cure

01:33:54.217 --> 01:33:56.309
and stayed clean
the whole stretch

01:33:56.344 --> 01:33:58.972
even though it's been easier
to get good junk in here

01:33:59.007 --> 01:34:00.893
than it is on the street.

01:34:02.019 --> 01:34:03.610
Shit, it's been hard, man.

01:34:03.645 --> 01:34:05.751
All I've been doing
is reading these diaries

01:34:05.786 --> 01:34:07.858
and wondering how the hell
I'm still alive,

01:34:08.692 --> 01:34:10.485
and even if I care.

01:34:11.695 --> 01:34:13.161
Suffice to say
that I'm finished

01:34:13.196 --> 01:34:15.802
with the asshole bandits
of shower-room rape,

01:34:15.837 --> 01:34:18.145
and suffice to say
that those swine guards

01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:20.453
won't draw blood
from my ankles again.

01:34:21.162 --> 01:34:23.872
Suffice to say that I've been
just thinking about dumb stuff

01:34:24.915 --> 01:34:29.589
like what a nice concept it is to have
a godmother and a godfather,

01:34:30.089 --> 01:34:32.925
wondering who
my godparents might be.

01:34:34.635 --> 01:34:36.095
My mom won't visit me here,

01:34:36.387 --> 01:34:39.598
so I guess I'll just have to wait
till I get home to ask.

01:34:47.188 --> 01:34:48.481
Jim?

01:34:49.357 --> 01:34:50.400
Who's there?

01:34:53.694 --> 01:34:54.946
It's me.

01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:57.781
Pedro?

01:35:00.078 --> 01:35:01.663
What's up, man?

01:35:02.289 --> 01:35:03.463
Nothing. You know.

01:35:03.498 --> 01:35:05.437
I... I hear you come here.

01:35:05.472 --> 01:35:07.133
I just came by to say hi.

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:08.760
I'm sorry about that night

01:35:08.795 --> 01:35:11.095
at the candy store
and everything.

01:35:11.130 --> 01:35:13.299
It's all right. Reform school
turned out to be real cool,

01:35:13.924 --> 01:35:15.676
so don't sweat it.

01:35:17.636 --> 01:35:19.408
Did you hear about Mickey,
that scumbag?

01:35:19.443 --> 01:35:21.181
He went and threw
some chump off a roof.

01:35:22.349 --> 01:35:24.496
He's getting
5 to 15 years, man.

01:35:24.531 --> 01:35:26.644
They tried him
like an adult.

01:35:27.312 --> 01:35:29.400
Shit.

01:35:30.276 --> 01:35:32.444
I got a present
for you, Jim.

01:35:34.529 --> 01:35:36.698
A bag of the finest dope

01:35:36.733 --> 01:35:38.033
in Manhattan.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.326
You know, me and you?

01:35:41.035 --> 01:35:42.370
Like old times?

01:35:45.998 --> 01:35:47.583
I can't.

01:35:49.752 --> 01:35:51.337
Come on.
It would be dynamite.

01:35:53.338 --> 01:35:54.840
I got this thing to do.

01:35:56.007 --> 01:35:58.179
Why don't you come
check it out?

01:35:59.097 --> 01:36:01.224
No. I'm going to go,
then, you know?

01:36:02.266 --> 01:36:03.809
You know how it is.

01:36:05.978 --> 01:36:07.896
Take care of yourself,
little man.

01:36:25.663 --> 01:36:27.209
Know this.

01:36:28.251 --> 01:36:30.420
There's different types
of users of junk.

01:36:31.296 --> 01:36:33.047
You got your rich
dilettante square-ass

01:36:33.082 --> 01:36:34.549
who dabbles now and then

01:36:35.425 --> 01:36:37.927
and always has enough money
to run off to the Riviera

01:36:37.962 --> 01:36:40.429
if he feels he's fucking around
to the danger point.

01:36:42.056 --> 01:36:44.725
Street junkies
hate these pricks,

01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:48.353
but they're always suckers,
and their money makes them tolerable.

01:36:49.896 --> 01:36:51.773
Then you got
your upper-middle-class

01:36:51.808 --> 01:36:53.399
Westchester preppies...

01:36:54.192 --> 01:36:55.946
same as the others,
basically.

01:36:56.739 --> 01:36:59.658
What they're good for is opening
their mommy and daddy's eyes

01:36:59.693 --> 01:37:01.083
to this social virus

01:37:01.118 --> 01:37:02.869
and putting pressure
on the government

01:37:02.904 --> 01:37:04.746
to do something about it.

01:37:07.165 --> 01:37:08.833
Then there's us street kids.

01:37:09.501 --> 01:37:12.587
Start fucking around
very young,

01:37:14.088 --> 01:37:15.965
13 or so...

01:37:18.008 --> 01:37:20.344
We think we all
got it under control

01:37:20.379 --> 01:37:23.263
and won't get strung out.

01:37:24.309 --> 01:37:26.269
This rarely works.

01:37:27.395 --> 01:37:29.397
I'm living proof.

01:37:30.982 --> 01:37:34.443
But in the end,
you just got to see the junk
