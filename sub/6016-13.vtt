WEBVTT

00:02.367 --> 00:03.629
So I went to a fashion show.

00:05.203 --> 00:07.262
The concept of modeling
is counterproductive...

00:07.438 --> 00:08.632
...to the fashion industry.

00:08.806 --> 00:11.570
Because when these women
are around, who's looking at clothes?

00:11.743 --> 00:14.541
I didn't notice any of the clothes.
We're all applauding. Yeah.

00:14.712 --> 00:17.272
What are we applauding?
"There's great-looking women here.

00:17.448 --> 00:18.574
This is great.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.378
I'm glad I'm here with all
these great-looking women."

00:21.553 --> 00:22.781
Anybody can design a shirt.

00:22.954 --> 00:27.391
It takes talent to get all these girls
in one spot. That's talent.

00:27.559 --> 00:30.153
What is this goofy walk
that the models do?

00:30.328 --> 00:32.796
You know this walk
that they do down the runway?

00:32.964 --> 00:34.329
Like they have to go somewhere.

00:34.499 --> 00:38.026
They're walking like they're really
on the way somewhere.

00:38.202 --> 00:40.966
Then they get to the end,
and it's like:

00:41.172 --> 00:43.572
"Well, I guess I'll just go back."

00:49.247 --> 00:51.340
I loved her, Jerry. I loved her.

00:51.516 --> 00:52.744
No, you didn't.

00:53.484 --> 00:57.648
- And she loved me. She really did.
- No, she didn't.

00:59.891 --> 01:03.987
What am I gonna do now?
I can't live without Susan.

01:04.162 --> 01:07.859
I gotta get her back. How?
How am I gonna to get her back?

01:08.032 --> 01:10.762
Not only didn't you love her,
you didn't even like her!

01:12.503 --> 01:15.529
- Who says?
- You did!

01:17.008 --> 01:20.171
A beautiful, successful, intelligent
woman's in love with me.

01:20.345 --> 01:23.906
And I throw it all away.
Oh, boy.

01:24.082 --> 01:26.676
Now I'll spend the rest
of my life living alone.

01:26.851 --> 01:29.513
I'll sit in my disgusting
little apartment...

01:29.687 --> 01:32.679
...watching basketball games,
eating Chinese takeout...

01:32.857 --> 01:36.793
...walking around with no underwear
because I'm too lazy to do the laundry.

01:38.296 --> 01:40.127
You walk around
with no underwear?

01:41.566 --> 01:43.500
What do you do when
you run out of laundry?

01:43.668 --> 01:45.829
I do a wash.

01:48.506 --> 01:50.497
Who am I gonna meet
that's better than her?

01:50.675 --> 01:52.609
No one, Jerry.
No one's better than her.

01:52.777 --> 01:55.245
When you were with her,
you said you couldn't stand her.

01:55.413 --> 01:57.313
I loved her.

01:57.482 --> 01:59.541
You said going up the steps
to her apartment...

01:59.717 --> 02:01.344
...was like being taken to a cell.

02:01.519 --> 02:04.920
I would give anything to be going
up those stairs again.

02:05.089 --> 02:06.852
I gotta call her. Should I call her?

02:07.025 --> 02:08.822
I don't know if that's
such a good idea.

02:08.993 --> 02:11.359
- Why?
- You need some professional advice.

02:11.529 --> 02:13.997
Why don't you go see
Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.

02:14.165 --> 02:16.725
I'm not gonna see that nut doctor
she went to Europe with.

02:16.901 --> 02:19.870
No, no. Elaine, what's the name
of that friend of yours...

02:20.038 --> 02:21.903
...that's a therapist? The woman.

02:22.073 --> 02:23.836
- Dana Foley.
- Right. Dana Foley.

02:24.008 --> 02:25.908
- She any good?
- Yeah, she's terrific.

02:26.077 --> 02:28.170
Why? You thinking of going?

02:29.280 --> 02:30.838
Tia? Who's that?

02:32.250 --> 02:33.911
It's that model I met on the plane.

02:37.355 --> 02:39.186
She sent you a Christmas card?

02:40.324 --> 02:42.849
And we're going out Saturday night.

02:43.027 --> 02:47.361
My darling, Susan. My darling!

02:47.532 --> 02:49.796
- What are you doing?
- Date with Fred.

02:49.967 --> 02:53.027
- The religious guy?
- He's not that religious.

02:54.105 --> 02:55.936
Let us pray.

02:57.909 --> 02:59.968
- You got any Double Crunch?
- Yeah.

03:00.144 --> 03:01.771
Kramer, should I call Susan?

03:01.946 --> 03:04.312
Now, what does the little man
inside you say?

03:04.482 --> 03:07.212
See, you gotta listen
to the little man.

03:08.219 --> 03:11.620
- My little man doesn't know.
- The little man knows all.

03:11.789 --> 03:14.223
My little man's an idiot.

03:16.027 --> 03:17.255
See, she was clever.

03:17.428 --> 03:20.591
She put her picture on her card.
I never do anything like that.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.892
You want a picture on a card.
I can do that.

03:23.067 --> 03:26.798
She kept such a nice, clean
apartment. She was so sanitary.

03:26.971 --> 03:29.769
No. I was thinking out loud.
I don't want my picture on a card.

03:29.941 --> 03:32.068
I'll take it.
I'll take care of everything.

03:32.243 --> 03:34.302
She made a big breakfast
every Sunday.

03:34.479 --> 03:36.470
I don't know what
she put in those eggs.

03:37.115 --> 03:40.380
You come on over. I'll have my
cereal, and I'll take your picture.

03:40.551 --> 03:42.143
Really? Can you take a picture?

03:42.320 --> 03:44.618
He takes good pictures.
He's got equipment there.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.222
- All right.
- Yeah.

03:46.390 --> 03:49.257
- I don't know about that outfit, though.
- What's wrong with it?

03:49.427 --> 03:51.395
Well, we'll have to improvise.

03:54.899 --> 03:56.992
Oh, hey

03:57.368 --> 04:00.132
If you happen to see

04:00.872 --> 04:04.069
The most beautiful girl

04:04.675 --> 04:07.473
Who walked out on me

04:08.446 --> 04:11.973
Tell her I'm sorry

04:13.217 --> 04:17.346
Tell her I need my baby

04:18.523 --> 04:20.786
Won't you tell her

04:21.892 --> 04:24.453
That I love her?

04:26.397 --> 04:28.729
- Oh, hey...
- George.

04:29.534 --> 04:32.503
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

04:34.705 --> 04:38.141
So I'm thinking of putting in
a tropical-fish tank right here.

04:38.309 --> 04:41.039
Are sure you're ready
for that kind of commitment?

04:41.212 --> 04:44.340
Well, if it doesn't work out,
I can flush them down the toilet.

04:44.515 --> 04:45.914
That's horrible.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.607
What's the perfume you're wearing?

04:47.785 --> 04:50.185
Oh, I completely forgot.
I want you to see this.

04:50.354 --> 04:53.414
That Calvin Klein ad I was telling
you about came out today.

04:53.591 --> 04:55.422
- What is that smell?
- It's here somewhere.

04:55.593 --> 04:58.858
- It smells like the beach.
- Exactly.

04:59.030 --> 05:02.022
- Oh, my God. Is that the new perfume?
- Yeah.

05:02.200 --> 05:06.398
I can't believe this. My neighbor had
the idea for this perfume last year.

05:06.571 --> 05:09.938
He met with a Calvin Klein executive.
I can't believe they stole his idea.

05:10.107 --> 05:13.838
- Are you sure?
- And you're the model for this perfume?

05:16.180 --> 05:18.307
That's him. He just came home.

05:18.482 --> 05:20.313
I'll lock the door.

05:20.785 --> 05:22.343
Hey.

05:23.354 --> 05:24.685
Hey.

05:25.223 --> 05:27.691
Hey, how you doing?

05:30.528 --> 05:32.428
Yeah, I'll see you later.

05:32.597 --> 05:35.725
I just wanted to borrow
your DustBuster.

05:37.068 --> 05:39.298
All right, come on in.

05:40.371 --> 05:42.271
- Just wait over here.
- What?

05:42.440 --> 05:44.271
Just wait here,
and I'll get it for you.

05:44.775 --> 05:47.209
- Kramer, this is Tia.
- Hello.

05:54.218 --> 05:56.152
- How tall are you?
- 5'10".

05:56.320 --> 05:58.788
Let's see. Come on. Back to back.

05:59.557 --> 06:01.354
- No, Kramer!
- What?

06:01.525 --> 06:03.823
What's the matter? I wanted
to see how tall she was.

06:03.995 --> 06:07.590
You're tall. She's tall. I'm tall.
What's the difference? We're all tall.

06:07.765 --> 06:09.255
- What's that?
- What?

06:09.433 --> 06:12.129
- That smell. What's that smell?
- What smell?

06:12.904 --> 06:15.771
It's very familiar. I can't put
my finger on it. It's familiar.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.465
Oh, they're all the same.
Here. Now, if you'll excuse us.

06:18.643 --> 06:20.338
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

06:20.511 --> 06:22.308
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you too.

06:23.915 --> 06:26.008
Yeah, I'll see you later.

06:27.685 --> 06:29.346
That was close.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.317
The beach!

06:32.256 --> 06:34.986
You smell like the beach.
What's that perfume you're wearing?

06:35.159 --> 06:37.650
- It's Ocean by Calvin Klein.
- Calvin Klein?

06:37.828 --> 06:40.661
No. No, that's my idea.
They stole my idea.

06:40.831 --> 06:43.629
I had the idea of a cologne that
made you smell like the beach.

06:43.801 --> 06:45.632
I know. Look at this.

06:48.539 --> 06:50.939
That's you. What is going on here?

06:51.108 --> 06:53.736
The jerk! He laughs at me.
Then he steals my idea!

06:53.911 --> 06:55.242
I could've been a millionaire.

06:55.413 --> 06:58.473
I could have been
a fragrance millionaire, Jerry.

06:59.317 --> 07:01.046
They're not gonna
get away with this.

07:05.923 --> 07:10.189
Hello, George. Come in, come in.
I've heard an awful lot about you.

07:10.361 --> 07:13.057
- Please sit down.
- Well, hello.

07:13.364 --> 07:15.924
Specifically, the reason
that I'm here...

07:16.100 --> 07:19.092
I don't know what
Elaine told you, but...

07:19.270 --> 07:22.171
...I broke up with my girlfriend
a couple of weeks ago.

07:22.340 --> 07:25.036
Actually, she broke up
with me, and...

07:25.209 --> 07:27.700
Well, I was the cause of it, and...

07:27.878 --> 07:30.779
I just wanted to find out from you...

07:30.948 --> 07:32.313
What's with this thing?

07:32.483 --> 07:35.748
- So she broke up with you.
- Yeah, and...

07:36.687 --> 07:38.655
Why won't this go down?

07:38.823 --> 07:40.791
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

07:40.958 --> 07:42.323
So why'd she break up with you?

07:42.493 --> 07:45.053
What is with this damn zipper?

07:45.229 --> 07:48.164
It doesn't matter. Fix it later.
Tell me about your girlfriend.

07:48.699 --> 07:51.634
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here.

07:51.802 --> 07:53.030
I can't get the cloth out.

07:53.204 --> 07:55.138
- It doesn't matter...
- This is a new jacket.

07:55.306 --> 07:58.298
Boy, this really burns me up.

07:59.176 --> 08:02.339
George. George, look at me.

08:02.513 --> 08:04.413
Okay, forget about the zipper.

08:06.684 --> 08:08.174
What's your girlfriend's name?

08:09.587 --> 08:11.919
- Susan.
- Okay, we're getting somewhere.

08:13.424 --> 08:19.158
It's just so frustrating. It's a
brand-new jacket for crying out loud.

08:26.871 --> 08:30.034
So Fred and I are gonna do volunteer
work for that church on Amsterdam.

08:30.207 --> 08:33.573
Volunteer work. See, that's what I love
about the holiday season.

08:33.744 --> 08:35.506
That's the true spirit
of Christmas.

08:35.679 --> 08:39.206
People being helped
by people other than me.

08:40.784 --> 08:43.549
That makes me feel good inside.

08:44.221 --> 08:47.122
Oh, look at what we have here.

08:47.291 --> 08:50.055
A Christmas card from Lainey.

08:50.861 --> 08:54.058
Thank you. You didn't have to
go to that trouble.

08:54.231 --> 08:56.631
It was no trouble.
My assistant did the whole thing.

08:56.801 --> 08:59.736
- How'd the picture come out?
- Oh, you know. It's a picture.

08:59.904 --> 09:02.566
Oh, look at that. Looks good.
Kramer did a good job.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.799
Yeah, well, how hard is it
to take a picture?

09:07.211 --> 09:10.078
- What?
- Did you look at this picture carefully?

09:10.381 --> 09:11.575
Carefully?

09:11.749 --> 09:16.812
Because I'm not sure,
and correct me if I'm wrong...

09:16.987 --> 09:19.854
...but I think I see a nipple.

09:23.861 --> 09:26.728
- What?
- Here, take a look. What is that?

09:26.897 --> 09:28.956
Oh, my God!

09:29.900 --> 09:31.959
That's my nipple!

09:32.169 --> 09:36.128
- That's what I thought.
- That's my nipple! My nipple's exposed!

09:36.707 --> 09:39.801
I sent this card
to hundreds of people.

09:40.311 --> 09:45.271
My parents. My boss.
Nana and Papa.

09:45.449 --> 09:48.111
- Didn't you look at the picture?
- Oh, God, I didn't notice.

09:48.285 --> 09:51.743
What am I gonna do? You know,
your whole life, you go through...

09:51.922 --> 09:55.085
...painstaking efforts to hide
your nipple, and then boom.

09:55.259 --> 09:58.285
Suddenly hundreds of people
get their own personal shot of it.

09:59.130 --> 10:00.859
Hey.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.532
- Have you seen the card?
- What card?

10:04.702 --> 10:07.796
- My Christmas card.
- Yeah. Of course, I took it.

10:07.972 --> 10:09.872
Did you notice
anything unusual about it?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.634
- No.
- Well, come here and take a look.

10:13.844 --> 10:15.744
- Yeah, so?
- So, what's that?

10:15.913 --> 10:18.245
- That's a nipple.
- Right.

10:22.753 --> 10:27.053
- Oh, great. Didn't you see that?
- No, I didn't notice it.

10:27.224 --> 10:29.488
It's because you made me wear
that stupid shirt.

10:29.660 --> 10:32.128
Well, maybe no one noticed it.
You didn't notice it.

10:32.296 --> 10:35.663
- Let's see if Newman sees it.
- No, I don't want him looking.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.994
What's the difference?
Everybody else has it.

10:38.169 --> 10:39.534
Give me that.

10:39.703 --> 10:43.104
Oh, my God, I sent one to the
super in my building, my mailman.

10:43.274 --> 10:44.707
My 10-year-old little nephew.

10:44.875 --> 10:50.279
Sister Mary Catherine, Father Chelios.
Oh, my God, Fred. I sent one to Fred.

10:50.948 --> 10:53.439
- Okay, what is it?
- Here.

10:53.617 --> 10:56.677
Take a look at this card. Tell me
if you notice anything unusual.

10:56.854 --> 10:59.482
Yeah, your nipple's showing.

11:01.158 --> 11:02.557
Okay, thanks.

11:02.726 --> 11:03.954
- Anything else?
- No.

11:04.128 --> 11:06.153
All right. See you later.

11:08.132 --> 11:10.600
What? So what?

11:10.901 --> 11:12.732
It's a nipple.

11:13.070 --> 11:17.302
It's a little brown,
circular protuberance.

11:17.675 --> 11:19.540
What's the big deal?

11:19.710 --> 11:22.611
Everybody's got them.
Look, I got them.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.571
- I got them too.
- Look at this.

11:26.483 --> 11:29.384
Everybody's got them.

11:29.954 --> 11:33.481
See, it's kind of gotta little piece of
cloth that's stuck underneath and...

11:33.657 --> 11:35.284
Well, can you pull it up a bit?

11:36.160 --> 11:38.856
Well, here you hold it.
Wait, hold it. Hold it.

11:39.029 --> 11:41.554
Damn it. I can't move it.

11:41.732 --> 11:43.563
God, I've never seen
a zipper so stubborn.

11:44.301 --> 11:45.563
Damn it. I almost had it.

11:45.736 --> 11:47.601
Okay. Wait, that'll separate it.

11:47.771 --> 11:49.398
- Let me try.
- Take it off the track.

11:49.573 --> 11:51.905
You're gonna rip it.
You're gonna rip it.

11:56.447 --> 11:58.312
I'm afraid we're
gonna have to stop now.

11:59.984 --> 12:01.474
Okay.

12:02.653 --> 12:05.781
My mother is gonna pay
for the session.

12:07.258 --> 12:09.249
Oh, is this Elaine?

12:09.426 --> 12:10.791
Yeah.

12:28.579 --> 12:30.103
No!

12:31.382 --> 12:33.316
No!

12:33.484 --> 12:35.315
No. Oh, no.

12:42.293 --> 12:45.524
I've called every day for four days.
She hasn't returned one call.

12:46.130 --> 12:48.655
Was it a scratch...

12:49.300 --> 12:51.165
...or a pick?

12:52.303 --> 12:53.702
It was a scratch.

12:53.871 --> 12:56.499
Hey, it's me.

12:58.042 --> 13:01.205
Don't you think I know the difference
between a pick and a scratch?

13:04.982 --> 13:06.415
- Yeah.
- It's me.

13:06.583 --> 13:07.880
Come on up.

13:08.052 --> 13:12.045
Was there any
nostril penetration?

13:13.791 --> 13:16.055
There may have been some
incidental penetration...

13:16.226 --> 13:19.718
...but from her angle, she was
in no position to make the call.

13:20.564 --> 13:24.193
So let's say, in her mind,
she witnessed a pick.

13:24.368 --> 13:27.201
- Okay, so then what?
- Is that so unforgivable?

13:27.371 --> 13:28.998
Is that like breaking
a commandment?

13:29.173 --> 13:31.869
Did God say to Moses,
"Thou shalt not pick"?

13:32.042 --> 13:35.068
I guarantee you
Moses was a picker.

13:36.113 --> 13:40.049
You wander through the desert
for 40 years with that dry air.

13:44.555 --> 13:48.321
You telling me you're not gonna have
occasion to clean house a little?

13:49.560 --> 13:52.085
Let me ask you something.
If you were dating somebody...

13:52.262 --> 13:54.856
...and she did that, would you
continue going out with her?

13:55.032 --> 13:57.500
No. That's disgusting.

13:59.703 --> 14:02.638
You cannot believe
what I am going through.

14:02.806 --> 14:05.400
That card is plastered
all over the office.

14:05.576 --> 14:07.806
Everybody's calling me "Nip."

14:09.580 --> 14:13.243
Yeah, that's my new nickname
at the office. Nip.

14:13.417 --> 14:15.578
These guys keep asking
me out for drinks.

14:15.753 --> 14:18.313
Not only that. Fred, you know,
the guy I told you about...

14:18.489 --> 14:20.389
...he hasn't called me in three days.

14:20.557 --> 14:23.253
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.725
How come I didn't get
a Christmas card?

14:25.896 --> 14:27.989
Everybody else got one.

14:28.165 --> 14:30.292
Jerry got one. Kramer got one.

14:30.467 --> 14:33.925
I thought we were good friends. I don't
get a Christmas card. I don't get it.

14:34.104 --> 14:37.198
You want a Christmas card? You want
a Christmas card? All right, here.

14:37.374 --> 14:39.103
Here's your Christmas card.

14:50.421 --> 14:52.389
You got any Double Crunch?

14:52.556 --> 14:54.615
Yeah, I think I do.

15:00.364 --> 15:02.491
- What's that perfume?
- It's the ocean.

15:02.666 --> 15:04.793
That's mine. That's my smell.

15:04.968 --> 15:08.096
Jerry, get that model to get me an
appointment with Calvin Klein.

15:08.272 --> 15:09.933
I can't. She won't return my calls...

15:10.107 --> 15:12.268
...because she caught me
in a pick at a light.

15:13.477 --> 15:16.469
- I thought you said it was a scratch.
- That's not what she thinks.

15:16.647 --> 15:19.980
Call her agency. Maybe she's been
out of town and didn't get the calls.

15:20.150 --> 15:21.549
Get it.

15:22.085 --> 15:23.746
All right.

15:23.987 --> 15:26.649
I'll call the agency.

15:31.962 --> 15:33.122
Hello.

15:33.297 --> 15:35.288
I'm trying to get in touch
with Tia Van Kamp.

15:35.466 --> 15:37.525
Do you know if she's been in town?

15:37.701 --> 15:39.430
Oh, really?

15:39.603 --> 15:41.537
- Well, thank you very much.
- What?

15:41.705 --> 15:44.572
She has been in town.
She's at Calvin Klein right now.

15:44.741 --> 15:46.936
Let's go.

15:50.581 --> 15:53.106
It'll be different this time.
I promise.

15:53.283 --> 15:55.683
I promise difference.
I'm committed to difference.

15:55.853 --> 15:58.845
I need someone a little more stable.

15:59.022 --> 16:01.820
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock.

16:01.992 --> 16:06.019
I take these glasses off, you can't tell
the difference between me and a rock.

16:06.196 --> 16:09.529
I put these glasses on a rock, you
know what jumps into people's minds?

16:09.700 --> 16:11.668
Costanza.

16:11.869 --> 16:14.565
- People don't change.
- I change. I change.

16:14.738 --> 16:16.968
Two weeks ago,
I tried a soft-boiled egg.

16:17.140 --> 16:22.043
Never liked it before. Now, I'm dunking
a piece of toast in there and loving it.

16:22.513 --> 16:25.175
I'm not a soft-boiled egg.

16:25.782 --> 16:28.546
And I am not a piece of toast.

16:28.719 --> 16:31.244
I just don't think that we have
anything in common.

16:31.421 --> 16:33.514
That's okay. That's good.

16:33.690 --> 16:36.750
You think Louis Pasteur and
his wife had anything in common?

16:36.927 --> 16:40.795
He was in the fields all day
with the cows and the milk...

16:40.964 --> 16:44.764
...examining the milk, delving into milk,
consumed with milk.

16:44.935 --> 16:47.130
Pasteurization. Homogenization.

16:47.304 --> 16:51.104
And she was in the kitchen, killing
cockroaches with a boot on each hand.

16:51.975 --> 16:54.239
Why were there
so many cockroaches?

16:54.411 --> 16:57.505
Because there was a lot of cake
lying around the house...

16:57.681 --> 17:02.141
...just sitting there with all the excess
milk from the all experiments.

17:05.355 --> 17:07.380
- And they got along?
- Yes. Yes.

17:07.958 --> 17:09.653
She didn't know
about pasteurization.

17:09.826 --> 17:13.785
He didn't know about fumigation.
But they made it work.

17:16.098 --> 17:18.260
- You can't go in.
- I want to talk to Calvin.

17:18.435 --> 17:19.732
- Let me talk to Calvin.
- Wait.

17:19.903 --> 17:21.962
- I just want to talk to Calvin.
- Kramer?

17:22.172 --> 17:23.763
- Oh, Tia, hi.
- Who are you?

17:23.941 --> 17:25.431
I'm here to talk about the ocean.

17:26.042 --> 17:28.170
Oh, yes, Kramer.

17:28.345 --> 17:32.076
I think I know something about this.
Would you excuse us, Tia?

17:32.649 --> 17:34.913
- I don't want any trouble, Calvin.
- Neither do I.

17:36.587 --> 17:38.316
Hello. There you are.

17:38.488 --> 17:40.012
Hello. What are you doing here?

17:40.190 --> 17:42.681
I had to talk to you.
You haven't returned my calls.

17:43.026 --> 17:44.960
Well, I've been busy.

17:45.128 --> 17:48.586
I thought we had a good time. The only
explanation I could come up with is...

17:48.765 --> 17:51.495
...you think that you caught me...

17:52.669 --> 17:54.034
I'd rather not talk about this.

17:54.204 --> 17:56.968
But I was clearly
on the outer edge of the nostril.

17:57.140 --> 17:59.370
- I know what I saw.
- But there was no pick.

17:59.543 --> 18:01.374
I did not pick. There was no pick.

18:01.545 --> 18:05.174
- I gotta go.
- No. No pick.

18:05.349 --> 18:06.714
Now here's the scoop, Calvin.

18:06.883 --> 18:11.343
I came in here last January
to talk to one of your flunkies.

18:11.521 --> 18:12.886
Interesting face.

18:14.658 --> 18:17.320
And when I told him my idea
about the beach cologne...

18:17.494 --> 18:18.984
...you know, he laughed at me.

18:19.162 --> 18:22.393
You're very lithe, aren't you?
Very graceful.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.791
Well, yeah.

18:27.638 --> 18:29.333
- Sit down.
- All right.

18:33.410 --> 18:35.970
You're very lean. But muscular.

18:36.146 --> 18:40.139
You know, I try to take care of myself.
I watch what I eat.

18:40.317 --> 18:43.081
Just recently, I cut out fructose.

18:43.253 --> 18:46.313
I think you're spectacular.

18:50.827 --> 18:54.786
I told you, Fred. My friend's
next-door neighbor took it.

18:54.965 --> 18:56.330
So, what happened?

18:56.500 --> 19:00.027
Well, l... I must have missed a button.
I forgot to button it.

19:00.203 --> 19:03.730
I really don't see how you could
miss a button like that.

19:03.907 --> 19:05.397
Oh, you've never missed a button?

19:07.477 --> 19:09.536
- Yeah.
- It's your sister, Gail.

19:09.713 --> 19:12.546
Oh, God. My nephew.

19:12.849 --> 19:14.578
Hi, Gail.

19:14.751 --> 19:15.979
Yeah.

19:16.153 --> 19:18.280
Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.

19:18.455 --> 19:20.855
Hey, Nip, you need
that manuscript, or can I take it?

19:21.024 --> 19:24.824
Take it. Take it.
And stop calling me Nip.

19:25.562 --> 19:27.928
It was an accident.

19:29.833 --> 19:32.961
Well, it's gotta be somewhere.
Look under his mattress.

19:52.122 --> 19:55.649
About the focus group? I have nothing
to do with the focus group.

19:58.495 --> 20:00.360
Oh, yeah.

20:03.633 --> 20:06.033
He's sexual...

20:06.203 --> 20:08.831
...athletic and without a trace
of self-consciousness.

20:09.439 --> 20:11.339
His buttocks are sublime.

20:11.975 --> 20:14.910
His pectorals could use some work.
Get him into the weight room.

20:15.078 --> 20:19.105
No. Let's get him in the studio today.
We could send these out immediately.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.016
You've done it again, C.K.

20:26.189 --> 20:29.522
And what if I did do it? Even though
I admit to nothing and never will.

20:29.693 --> 20:31.285
What does that make me?

20:31.461 --> 20:35.363
I'm not just defending myself, but all
those pickers who have been caught.

20:35.966 --> 20:37.831
Each and every one of them...

20:38.001 --> 20:43.303
...who has to suffer the shame and
humiliation because of people like you.

20:43.473 --> 20:48.274
Are we not human?
If we pick, do we not bleed?

20:50.380 --> 20:53.508
I am not an animal.

20:53.683 --> 20:58.177
I did not bare myself deliberately,
but I tell you, I wish now that I had.

20:58.355 --> 21:01.813
Because it is not me
that has been exposed, but you.

21:01.992 --> 21:05.621
For I have seen the nipple
on your soul!

21:08.331 --> 21:10.799
So the minute I started up the steps
to her apartment...

21:10.967 --> 21:12.559
...I knew I made a terrible mistake.

21:14.104 --> 21:16.038
Going back with her.

21:16.339 --> 21:18.830
So we're in her apartment.
She goes into the bathroom.

21:19.009 --> 21:22.775
I'm cursing myself.
Now how do I get out of there?

21:22.946 --> 21:25.176
And then it hits me
like a bolt of lightning.

21:26.383 --> 21:28.317
The pick.

21:30.253 --> 21:31.720
- The pick?
- The pick?

21:32.088 --> 21:35.819
She comes out of the bathroom,
I'm in up to my wrist.

21:37.894 --> 21:40.863
You should've seen
the look on her face.

21:41.031 --> 21:43.499
I think I've seen that look.

21:44.634 --> 21:47.626
Hey, I got the magazine.
The underwear ad came out.

21:47.804 --> 21:49.704
Hey, Calvin Klein!

21:49.873 --> 21:53.809
- Hey, you look great!
- Neat.

21:53.977 --> 21:56.207
Boy, they really
worked on your pectorals.

21:56.379 --> 21:59.109
- Well.
- Your buttocks are spectacular.

21:59.282 --> 22:01.443
- Oh, my.
- What?

22:01.618 --> 22:05.520
Well, I'm not sure...

22:05.755 --> 22:09.088
...but I think I see your...

22:09.359 --> 22:11.122
The human body
is a lot of maintenance.

22:11.294 --> 22:14.821
A lot of showering, a lot of shaving,
a lot of cleaning, a lot of clipping...

22:14.998 --> 22:18.024
...a lot of checking. If your body
was a car, you wouldn't buy it.

22:18.201 --> 22:21.068
It's too much upkeep.
It's a pain.

22:21.238 --> 22:23.900
But women definitely go
to the absolute extreme.

22:24.074 --> 22:28.602
To me, it's amazing the way women
take care of all the hair on their bodies.

22:28.778 --> 22:30.803
One of the
great mysteries to me...

22:30.981 --> 22:33.973
...is the fact that a woman
could pour hot wax on her legs...

22:34.150 --> 22:39.144
...rip the hair out by the root
and still be afraid of a spider.
