WEBVTT

00:07.433 --> 00:09.733
...and I can feel the guy
from Lincoln Prep

00:09.767 --> 00:11.467
is only two strides
behind me.

00:11.500 --> 00:14.500
And all I can think is how
you say, don't look back.

00:14.533 --> 00:16.833
Something might be
gaining on you.

00:16.867 --> 00:20.167
You could see it in his
face. He did this thing,

00:20.200 --> 00:21.433
and he leaned forward...

00:21.467 --> 00:22.900
And I won!

00:22.933 --> 00:26.567
Yeah! Sorry I
missed it, Cam.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.767
But I'm glad that you
love running track.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.067
Sports are great.

00:31.100 --> 00:33.600
Keeps you busy and
out of trouble.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.300
You don't want to
get in trouble.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.667
You guys are already
on a tough cellblock.

00:37.700 --> 00:41.667
Toughest warden ever.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.467
Guess that means I gotta work
extra hard to get outta here,

00:44.500 --> 00:47.433
so I can break
you two out.

00:47.467 --> 00:50.300
So this place is kinda
like a national park.

00:50.333 --> 00:54.900
Gotta clean it up real
good or the rangers get mad.

00:56.867 --> 00:59.500
It's not time to go!

00:59.533 --> 01:02.200
Yeah, honey, it is.

01:02.233 --> 01:05.433
I don't want to leave.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.067
Bye, Uncle Tim.

01:11.067 --> 01:12.200
Take care.

01:12.233 --> 01:15.533
I'll see you guys.
Thanks for coming.

01:51.067 --> 01:54.333
Your aunt and uncle,
they gotta get going.

01:54.367 --> 01:57.767
Be good.
Listen to your mom.

01:58.433 --> 02:03.500
Mariah, Mom needs to
say bye to Dad.

02:09.833 --> 02:11.300
You know what you
gotta do, right?

02:11.333 --> 02:13.200
Find a job, find a
place, find a program.

02:13.233 --> 02:18.067
That's right, show my sister
you're as good a mother

02:18.100 --> 02:20.600
as she is, any day.

02:20.633 --> 02:22.967
I will.

02:56.600 --> 02:59.633
I don't think so, we'll
keep eyes on him though.

03:02.067 --> 03:03.633
Take him in, please.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.533
Your perp looks vaguely
familiar. What's going on?

03:06.567 --> 03:08.700
We responded to a break-in
at Pine Ridge Lanes.

03:08.733 --> 03:10.067
Is Ponytail the perp?

03:10.067 --> 03:11.367
No, he's the manager.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.867
That's it.

03:12.900 --> 03:15.067
I used to take my
girls bowling there.

03:15.067 --> 03:17.433
He's gotten a little grayer,
but I recognize him now.

03:17.467 --> 03:19.833
If he's the victim, why did
you bring him in cuffs?

03:19.867 --> 03:22.800
Appears he's been selling heroin
while renting bowling shoes.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.067
Because those two
things go so well together.

03:25.067 --> 03:26.200
At the alley itself?

03:26.233 --> 03:28.100
Yeah, we were doing a
sweep of the building,

03:28.133 --> 03:29.867
determining if anything
had been stolen

03:29.900 --> 03:31.667
other than the cash
in the strongbox.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.700
I noticed a loose floorboard
in the manager's office.

03:33.733 --> 03:36.467
Pulled it up and found enough
drugs there to keep an entire

03:36.500 --> 03:38.667
league blissed
out for a month.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.600
Right there in the
middle of the community.

03:40.633 --> 03:42.200
How long has
this been going on?

03:42.233 --> 03:43.933
He wasn't forthcoming.

03:43.967 --> 03:45.600
But he's shut down now.

03:45.633 --> 03:47.967
One less drug
dealer in Crestview.

03:48.067 --> 03:50.233
Good work, detectives.

03:58.733 --> 04:02.500
You need to help! I can't take
care of mom by myself.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.067
I thought the whole point of
rehab is so she can learn

04:05.067 --> 04:07.067
to take care of herself.

04:07.067 --> 04:10.500
Fine. I've done it before
and I'll do it again.

04:10.533 --> 04:13.533
Great, thank you for
your service.

04:13.567 --> 04:17.200
Look, you're the one that knows
how to take care of her drama.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.333
Maybe this time you
can convice her

04:19.367 --> 04:22.433
not to start any
for a change.

04:28.967 --> 04:34.700
Uncle Matt, I talked to Coach
Crandall and you were right.

04:34.733 --> 04:38.067
I do have to wear a
tie for the banquet.

04:41.600 --> 04:45.100
What? You're going to a
banquet, Cameron?

04:45.133 --> 04:51.600
Uh, yeah. It's an end-of-season
thing for track, that's all.

04:51.633 --> 04:53.333
How nice!

04:53.367 --> 04:55.333
Jackie, you should take
my ticket and go

04:55.367 --> 04:57.933
with Cameron and Matt.

04:57.967 --> 05:00.767
Why can't we all go?

05:00.800 --> 05:05.667
Well, each athlete is only
allowed to bring two guests.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.500
It's a budget thing. Maybe
you should go with Jackie.

05:08.533 --> 05:11.133
No, honey you drove
them all over the place

05:11.167 --> 05:12.933
to meets and stuff.

05:12.967 --> 05:15.767
And it was really fun. I got
to meet a lot of great kids.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.333
I got to see this guy tear
it up, meet after meet.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.433
You should go.

05:22.467 --> 05:25.167
But you were the one that came
and cheered me on, Aunt Allison.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.800
Whenever I could. But your mom
and Uncle Matt should be there.

05:31.700 --> 05:35.633
So it's settled!

05:35.667 --> 05:38.133
Two handsome men
taking me to a banquet!

05:46.867 --> 05:50.567
Fred! Fred!

05:50.600 --> 05:53.633
I'm gonna cuff you and put you
in a room if you don't stop.

05:53.667 --> 05:56.067
My girlfriend's in the hospital
because of her boyfriend.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.800
Todd didn't hurt anybody.

06:04.833 --> 06:07.333
Fred, we spoke
to the hospital.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.900
Your girlfriend and a dozen
other people are in the ER

06:09.933 --> 06:12.233
and doctors think it's
because of bad heroin.

06:12.267 --> 06:15.133
Are you saying that Delilah had
something to do with that?

06:15.167 --> 06:18.667
Her boyfriend sold us
bad stuff last night.

06:18.700 --> 06:21.400
Is that why you attacked
her in Crestview Park?

06:22.533 --> 06:24.333
It hurts...

06:24.367 --> 06:29.467
Stupid junkie. Those drugs
are gonna kill you man!

06:29.500 --> 06:33.700
This is exactly
why I drink.

06:33.733 --> 06:37.067
I need a transport to the
ER. Yeah. Thanks.

06:37.067 --> 06:43.533
Delilah, you didn't
take any of the bad drugs?

06:43.567 --> 06:45.400
Heroin is gonna make
your teeth fall out, honey,

06:45.433 --> 06:47.800
Don't do those drugs.

06:47.833 --> 06:52.067
So why is your boyfriend
selling poisoned drugs?

06:52.067 --> 06:55.233
Todd didn't poison them.

06:55.267 --> 07:01.100
Someone broke in and wrecked his
stash without him realizing.

07:01.133 --> 07:06.233
And then all these guys got
sick and Todd freaked out!

07:06.267 --> 07:09.067
He thought the bogeyman was
after him and he took off!

07:09.067 --> 07:12.333
Okay, so your boyfriend's
no longer in Crestview?

07:12.367 --> 07:19.533
Todd had to go far away where
they weren't gonna kill him.

07:19.567 --> 07:22.967
So far that I can't
even find him.

07:23.067 --> 07:28.433
Which means I'm free all
weekend, if you want to party.

07:28.467 --> 07:31.867
We can all party!

07:31.900 --> 07:34.733
Can you help me?
Stay there.

07:39.467 --> 07:41.733
First, we have a break-in at
the bowling alley that served

07:41.767 --> 07:43.300
to shut one dealer down.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.533
Now we've got a poisoned
batch of drugs that drives out

07:45.567 --> 07:47.367
another dealer?

07:47.400 --> 07:49.433
Someone is trying to
drive them out of business?

07:49.467 --> 07:51.900
Certainly looks that way.

07:51.933 --> 07:55.733
I think we have a turf war
shaping up in Crestview.

08:13.633 --> 08:16.733
You're sexy when
you're deducing.

08:16.767 --> 08:20.733
Sorry. I really try not to
bring work home with me.

08:20.767 --> 08:24.167
I know some of them stick
more than others. What's up?

08:24.200 --> 08:28.500
There's been this surge in
drug-related crime like a

08:28.533 --> 08:32.167
break-in staged to take down a
dealer and someone poisoning

08:32.200 --> 08:34.533
another dealer's stash...

08:34.567 --> 08:36.833
You've had dealers knock try
to knock each other around

08:36.867 --> 08:38.567
for territory before.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.333
Yeah, but this is
on a different scale.

08:40.367 --> 08:42.067
It's like somebody from
outside the current system

08:42.100 --> 08:43.867
coming in and trying
to break it down.

08:43.900 --> 08:46.367
There's this big
power grab.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.100
But not to tear it all down.

08:48.133 --> 08:50.067
To build it up with
a new guy in charge?

08:50.100 --> 08:51.700
It's the escalation
that worries me,

08:51.733 --> 08:54.433
but Wilkes is bringing in
the DEA from Seattle,

08:54.467 --> 08:57.267
so that's going
to be better.

08:57.300 --> 09:00.400
I don't know, having these
massive shifts right on our

09:00.433 --> 09:05.667
doorstep, around our kids.
That's what I don't like.

09:05.700 --> 09:08.433
I understand.

09:08.467 --> 09:11.667
But as the number one fan
of the Crestview Police

09:11.700 --> 09:13.933
Department, I have all the
confidence in the world

09:13.967 --> 09:18.367
you can identify and
neutralize this threat.

09:25.933 --> 09:26.967
Oooh hello.

09:27.067 --> 09:33.733
Oh! Cameron! Umm, hi! I
thought you were sleeping?

09:33.767 --> 09:37.067
Yeah, I was getting ready.

09:37.067 --> 09:39.500
But then I got a
text message from Zack,

09:39.533 --> 09:41.167
the high jumper...

09:41.200 --> 09:43.433
High jumper guy.

09:43.467 --> 09:47.933
Zack's dad is going out of
town for business, and Zack

09:47.967 --> 09:53.833
knew I was asking everyone
for an extra ticket, so...

09:53.867 --> 09:59.567
anyways, you can have his
dad's ticket to the banquet,

09:59.600 --> 10:01.000
Aunt Allison.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.333
That's great, that's
fantastic! Thank you.

10:03.367 --> 10:05.133
Will you please
thank Zack for me?

10:05.167 --> 10:09.000
Yeah.

10:11.933 --> 10:15.467
Thanks for...
thanks.

10:17.667 --> 10:20.967
I'd no idea he'd care so much
if I didn't go to the banquet.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
Who knew? He's got a soft, chewy
center under that little shell.

10:28.633 --> 10:31.333
Hmm...

10:34.433 --> 10:38.500
Detectives! Agent Rob McGee,
Detectives Mclean and Stewart.

10:38.533 --> 10:39.567
Good to have you here.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.733
Thank you.

10:40.767 --> 10:41.967
Thanks for coming
across the bridge.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.167
My pleasure.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.500
Hey, I'll show up wherever
there's a turf war going down,

10:45.533 --> 10:47.933
and it looks like you
might have a nasty one.

10:47.967 --> 10:49.933
Okay Lieutenant, last one.

10:49.967 --> 10:54.500
Detective Lee, this is
Agent Rob McGee, from DEA.

10:54.533 --> 10:56.667
Detective Peter Lee?

10:56.700 --> 10:58.767
You're the one that made
that bust at Evergreen Lake

10:58.800 --> 11:00.367
a couple years back,
am I right?

11:00.400 --> 11:03.067
I didn't know that news
made it out of Crestview.

11:03.067 --> 11:06.867
How did you figure out the
supplier was using a seaplane

11:06.900 --> 11:09.333
to make a drop at
such a secluded spot?

11:09.367 --> 11:11.800
The pieces just
seemed to fit together.

11:11.833 --> 11:15.667
That's some inspired detective
work. Congratulations.

11:15.700 --> 11:17.867
I didn't know we were
calling in the big guns.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.533
I could push off my
vacation one week.

11:19.567 --> 11:21.667
I'd love to see how
the experts do the job.

11:21.700 --> 11:23.967
Thanks, but if you don't
take at least three of those

11:24.067 --> 11:26.367
vacation days, HR is going
to come after both of us,

11:26.400 --> 11:27.467
so go, enjoy.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.800
Pleasure to meet you, McGee.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.067
Yeah, you too.

11:30.067 --> 11:31.700
Have a good one.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.533
Why don't you tell them
what you were telling me?

11:34.567 --> 11:37.300
We've been seeing a
huge migration lately.

11:37.333 --> 11:40.067
Drugs moving from the
streets into the suburbs.

11:40.067 --> 11:43.633
Your users are your usual
classic junkies all the way to

11:43.667 --> 11:46.167
these suburban moms and dads.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.900
How widespread is it?

11:47.933 --> 11:49.367
Very!

11:49.400 --> 11:52.467
It's a fallout from the use of
oxycodone and users of other

11:52.500 --> 11:56.067
pharmaceuticals who are now
using heroin and other drugs

11:56.067 --> 11:58.200
that we usually only see
on the streets.

11:58.233 --> 12:01.933
Agent McGee told me about a
woman from North Seattle --

12:01.967 --> 12:04.533
mother of five,
house with a view.

12:04.567 --> 12:07.367
Died from a heroin
overdose three weeks ago.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.633
Those poor kids...

12:08.667 --> 12:11.600
Yeah, we were trying to figure
out where she was getting her

12:11.633 --> 12:13.867
stuff, but I found that she
had a bunch of friends,

12:13.900 --> 12:16.533
including Crestview, so I came
to talk to a group of women

12:16.567 --> 12:18.967
who I felt were using, too,
but I couldn't get them to

12:19.067 --> 12:20.733
give up their source.

12:20.767 --> 12:23.867
But I do have their names and
I do know where to find them.

12:23.900 --> 12:26.967
I was thinking you might be
able to use his information to

12:27.067 --> 12:30.067
go after them. See if you can
figure out where they're buying.

12:30.067 --> 12:31.967
Okay, let's hope
they'll talk to me.

12:32.067 --> 12:34.333
You'll find a way.

12:58.333 --> 13:00.533
How many of those are yours?

13:00.567 --> 13:04.133
Only two.
Do you have any?

13:04.167 --> 13:08.267
None that play on
swings anymore.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.867
Are you okay?

13:09.900 --> 13:12.300
I wish they made park
benches that recline.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.300
I'd pay extra for that.

13:14.333 --> 13:15.933
I used to take
something for the pain,

13:15.967 --> 13:18.633
but, wow, that refill three
times sticker doesn't last as

13:18.667 --> 13:22.933
long as I hoped it
would. Sorry.

13:22.967 --> 13:26.100
No, I know exactly what
you're going through.

13:26.133 --> 13:29.667
Jessica sat on my sciatic nerve
during my entire pregnancy.

13:29.700 --> 13:32.200
There were whole weeks after
she was born where I could

13:32.233 --> 13:34.700
hardly even move.
The pain was excruciating.

13:34.733 --> 13:39.267
What did you take for it? I'm
sorry; that's a little personal.

13:39.300 --> 13:43.400
That's okay, I'm always willing
to help a fellow mom in need.

13:46.833 --> 13:49.633
Yoga.

13:49.667 --> 13:52.333
Oh, thanks, but I was hoping
you'd tell me where I can get

13:52.367 --> 13:54.667
something a little stronger. You
know, something with refills.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.333
No, you don't understand.

13:56.367 --> 13:58.833
There's a place just
around the corner.

13:58.867 --> 14:01.700
See Pam at
Energy Yoga Studio.

14:01.733 --> 14:04.767
She'll have exactly
what you're looking for.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.633
Thanks.

14:09.633 --> 14:12.600
Jessica, stop
eating the rocks!

14:42.267 --> 14:43.767
McLean residence.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.333
Mrs. McLean?

14:45.367 --> 14:48.400
I'm sorry, she's not here right
now. Can I take a message?

14:48.433 --> 14:50.200
Hi, it's Coach Crandall,
the track coach from

14:50.233 --> 14:51.500
Crestview High School.

14:51.533 --> 14:54.400
Coach Crandall! I'm Jackie
Olson, I'm Cameron's mom.

14:54.433 --> 14:56.233
Pleasure to meet
you, Mrs. Olson.

14:56.267 --> 14:58.567
I was just at the hotel,
reviewing preparations for our

14:58.600 --> 15:00.767
banquet tomorrow, and
I realized I needed some

15:00.800 --> 15:02.667
last-minute help.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.833
Mrs. McLean is one of those
moms who always says yes.

15:05.867 --> 15:08.267
Well, whatever Allison
was gonna help you with,

15:08.300 --> 15:11.433
I'm sure I can take
care of it for you.

15:11.467 --> 15:13.100
That's great, Mrs. Olson.

15:13.133 --> 15:16.067
I need someone to pick up the
centerpiece for the head table

15:16.100 --> 15:18.467
at Pine Avenue Florist
tomorrow afternoon.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.067
No problem at all. I can
take care of that for you.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.800
Is there anything
else I can do?

15:22.833 --> 15:25.667
Actually, I also need someone
to type up the program,

15:25.700 --> 15:26.800
make it look nice.

15:26.833 --> 15:29.567
I can take care of that as well.
Why don't you send the

15:29.600 --> 15:31.400
information home with Cameron
and I'll get it done.

15:31.433 --> 15:33.067
Thank you, Mrs. Olson.

15:33.067 --> 15:35.500
Cameron loves being
on the track team,

15:35.533 --> 15:38.067
so anything I can do to
help, it's my pleasure.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.967
Great, we'll
see you tomorrow.

15:40.067 --> 15:42.300
Okay, bye.

15:47.533 --> 15:49.167
Everyone has the address?

15:49.200 --> 15:51.900
Energy Yoga
Studio, Old Towne Plaza.

15:51.933 --> 15:54.167
I checked possession
busts going back six months.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.933
Found a cluster in a mile
radius of her location.

15:56.967 --> 16:00.067
Easy customer access,
centralized location.

16:00.067 --> 16:02.567
And the owner fits the
profile of the dealer from

16:02.600 --> 16:03.867
the North Seattle case.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.567
You think she's the one behind
the break-in, and the poisoning?

16:06.600 --> 16:09.133
Falls in line with
things that I've seen before.

16:09.167 --> 16:11.133
Small-time dealer decides
they want to be bigger-time,

16:11.167 --> 16:13.633
so they try to take
out the competition.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.900
That's why we're going
after her, first.

16:15.933 --> 16:19.200
Have each other's
backs, and stay safe.

16:27.567 --> 16:29.900
Pam, I don't understand.
You can't just leave.

16:29.933 --> 16:32.067
The four o'clock
class: it's not covered!

16:32.067 --> 16:35.067
Post a sign that says cancelled.
Tell people I got called away

16:35.067 --> 16:37.700
for a few days; maybe longer.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.667
Pam Randolph?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.367
Crestview Police Department.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.733
All of you guys at once?

16:48.767 --> 16:50.533
I didn't think you'd
all come together...

16:50.567 --> 16:54.567
We're going to need you
to come with us.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.467
Pam! What...?

16:56.500 --> 16:58.133
Put the gun down.

16:58.167 --> 17:00.800
I'm not going to do
what you tell me.

17:02.133 --> 17:05.267
Nobody shoot!

17:07.233 --> 17:10.133
We've got a hostage
situation at Old Towne Plaza.

17:13.733 --> 17:17.067
Pam, there's no need to be
holding a hostage, okay?

17:17.100 --> 17:18.700
We just want to talk to you.

17:18.733 --> 17:22.533
No, it's not too late, but you
have to release that hostage.

17:22.567 --> 17:25.967
Let me just talk-- there's a
better way for us to

17:26.067 --> 17:29.267
have this conversation, if
you just do one thing for me.

17:29.300 --> 17:32.167
Are you willing to
do one thing for me?

17:44.633 --> 17:46.467
Hey Matt, do you know
where a good place

17:46.500 --> 17:47.867
to get balloons would be?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.133
Balloons?

17:49.167 --> 17:52.633
Yeah, Coach Crandall asked me
to pick up the centerpiece for

17:52.667 --> 17:55.567
the banquet tomorrow,
and I thought maybe balloons

17:55.600 --> 17:57.900
in team colors
might be nice.

17:57.933 --> 18:00.233
You talked to
Coach Crandall?

18:00.267 --> 18:03.133
Yeah, he called earlier
asking for help.

18:03.167 --> 18:05.500
He called for Allison?

18:05.533 --> 18:09.433
I said that I would do it, and
I'm also typing up the program

18:09.467 --> 18:11.267
for the evening.

18:11.300 --> 18:14.400
That's fine, I just didn't
realize you'd talked to him.

18:14.433 --> 18:16.600
Try Party Perfect
for the balloons.

18:16.633 --> 18:17.467
They're over at
the mall.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.733
Mom, are you
going to the mall?

18:18.767 --> 18:20.333
Sounds like it.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.833
I'll go with you.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.767
It's okay I've got
it under control.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.400
Why don't you wait
for Allison to get back?

18:25.433 --> 18:26.233
She can take you.

18:26.267 --> 18:28.067
Both of you:
thank you very much,

18:28.067 --> 18:31.167
but I can do this, and
I can do it on my own.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.400
Hello?

18:37.433 --> 18:39.200
Matt, it's Devin.

18:39.233 --> 18:43.367
Hey Devin.

18:43.400 --> 18:46.067
Listen... there's something
you need to know.

18:46.067 --> 18:48.800
And you might not
want to tell your kids.

18:50.867 --> 18:53.267
I give up my assistant,
and I get back a cop?

18:53.300 --> 18:55.367
This feels like
I traded up.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.767
I wanted us to be able
to talk, face-to-face.

18:57.800 --> 19:02.067
Okay, how many of you are
out there? Fifteen? Twenty?

19:02.100 --> 19:04.267
Let's not worry
about that right now.

19:04.300 --> 19:05.933
The only thing that
matters is you and me.

19:05.967 --> 19:08.300
Are you working for him?
Is that why you wanted inside?

19:08.333 --> 19:09.633
Working for whom?

19:09.667 --> 19:11.400
I heard about the manager
at the bowling alley

19:11.433 --> 19:14.067
getting robbed, except they
left how much product?

19:14.067 --> 19:17.100
All so he'd get taken
away. And Todd.

19:17.133 --> 19:19.400
Where's Todd after they broke
in and poisoned his stuff to

19:19.433 --> 19:22.800
put him out of business?

19:22.833 --> 19:24.433
We heard that
Todd left town.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.633
What are you going to believe
when his body turns up in

19:26.667 --> 19:28.500
Green River, killed by the
dirty cop who's trying to

19:28.533 --> 19:29.767
shove us all out?

19:29.800 --> 19:32.500
Dirty cop? You think a police
officer is behind this?

19:32.533 --> 19:33.767
Why would you say that?

19:33.800 --> 19:35.833
Because he told me.

19:35.867 --> 19:37.500
Wait, this police
officer came to you?

19:37.533 --> 19:41.100
You talked to this officer?

19:44.200 --> 19:46.633
He came this morning and he
told me I was going to work

19:46.667 --> 19:48.800
for him or... that I
didn't have a choice.

19:48.833 --> 19:51.067
I had until 5PM tomorrow,
because that was when he's

19:51.067 --> 19:54.067
bringing in more heroin
than Crestview had ever seen.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.133
Once those drugs
hit the streets,

19:56.167 --> 19:58.233
all offers of previous
employment will be

19:58.267 --> 20:01.233
rescinded. Along with anyone
who says no to his deal.

20:01.267 --> 20:03.300
What does this guy look like?
Did he give you a name?

20:03.333 --> 20:05.700
He looks like... a cop.

20:05.733 --> 20:08.433
He didn't give a name, he just
bragged about how he was going

20:08.467 --> 20:10.433
to be Crestview's
own Rollo Tomassi.

20:10.467 --> 20:12.000
Rollo Tomassi?
Like in the movie?

20:12.033 --> 20:13.967
I don't know. I don't
know anything except,

20:14.000 --> 20:18.633
he'll kill me. I
know that he will.

20:21.467 --> 20:25.700
Do you have kids, Pam?

20:25.733 --> 20:28.067
Three.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.967
And my ex is worthless.
My kids need me.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.367
I need to be okay for them.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.633
The best way to make that
happen is if you come to the

20:34.667 --> 20:36.533
station with me, right now. We
can get a sketch artist.

20:36.567 --> 20:38.733
We can figure out
who this guy is.

20:38.767 --> 20:42.467
Are you crazy? If he thinks
I've helped you, I'm dead.

20:42.500 --> 20:46.900
If you try to do this
by yourself, you're dead.

20:46.933 --> 20:52.667
Every decision you've made has
been for your kids. Right?

20:52.700 --> 20:56.067
Do this for them.

21:01.400 --> 21:05.167
We're coming out.
Hold your fire.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.333
What if it's one of them?

21:09.367 --> 21:12.167
It's okay, I'll protect you.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.167
This is my partner,
Devin Stewart.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.333
Pam's gonna help
us break this.

21:17.367 --> 21:18.700
We appreciate your
cooperation, ma'am.

21:18.733 --> 21:20.900
We're gonna go down to the
station and we're gonna figure

21:20.933 --> 21:23.367
this out. We're gonna
get this guy, okay?

21:23.400 --> 21:25.167
This goes a lot
deeper than we thought.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.833
Okay, let's go Pam.

21:28.067 --> 21:30.133
Take cover!

21:30.167 --> 21:31.567
Quadrant scan!

21:31.600 --> 21:36.067
Watch your backs!

21:36.100 --> 21:39.433
Anyone down?

21:40.933 --> 21:46.667
Pam? No, no no!

21:49.067 --> 21:53.367
No, no, no!

22:04.600 --> 22:08.867
Hey sorry. I just
had to see you.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.267
How are you
doing, you okay?

22:10.300 --> 22:14.400
Yeah...
it was tough.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.933
Gotta go debrief?

22:15.967 --> 22:17.567
Yeah, we do.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.700
Alright, I have to go take
care of something but,

22:19.733 --> 22:21.067
I'll see you
back at home.

22:21.100 --> 22:23.100
I'm glad.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.167
Hey babe, thanks for
coming to check on me.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.633
Of course.

22:28.767 --> 22:31.333
Hey Pete? I thought you'd
be halfway to Idaho by now.

22:31.367 --> 22:33.300
Lieutenant put out the
word to everyone off shift.

22:33.333 --> 22:35.533
I even called Victoria and
she's trying to get a flight

22:35.567 --> 22:36.867
back from Jackson Hole.

22:36.900 --> 22:39.567
That bullet could have hit
one of our best detectives.

22:39.600 --> 22:42.500
We all want to help find
whoever ordered the hit.

22:42.533 --> 22:45.300
Okay people, let's put
together what we know.

22:47.867 --> 22:51.100
Angle of the shot verifies
the shooter was right here,

22:51.133 --> 22:52.900
but there was
nothing at that site.

22:52.933 --> 22:55.867
No casings, no footprints, it's
like no one was ever there.

22:55.900 --> 22:58.067
Drug dealers know the
best shots in the business.

22:58.067 --> 23:00.233
They do a lot of
work together.

23:00.267 --> 23:03.133
Detective McLean, did the
victim share any information

23:03.167 --> 23:04.600
while you were together?

23:04.633 --> 23:06.567
Pam said she was
scared of the police.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.800
That's why she took a
hostage to begin with.

23:08.833 --> 23:12.067
She said...

23:12.100 --> 23:14.433
She said a new dealer in town
is making serious threats,

23:14.467 --> 23:18.567
forcing everyone either to work
for him, or not work at all.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.767
That falls in line with your
bowling alley hit, right?

23:21.800 --> 23:23.933
And the reason that
dealer left town.

23:23.967 --> 23:26.400
She also said this dealer
came and told her a big

23:26.433 --> 23:29.233
shipment is coming in
tomorrow at five o'clock.

23:29.267 --> 23:31.233
Once it hits the streets,
he's in charge

23:31.267 --> 23:33.067
and everything's
gonna get worse.

23:33.100 --> 23:35.400
That gives us a deadline,
and not a lot of time.

23:35.433 --> 23:37.600
I want everyone to work
their connections.

23:37.633 --> 23:40.400
Informants, anyone who owes
you a favor. Shake it out.

23:40.433 --> 23:42.767
We need to figure out the
location of this delivery,

23:42.800 --> 23:45.133
and the clock's
ticking, so let's go.

23:47.333 --> 23:48.967
Lieutenant, may
I have a word?

23:49.067 --> 23:50.067
Quickly.

23:51.867 --> 23:54.400
I didn't want to say this
in front of the whole shop,

23:54.433 --> 23:57.433
but the yoga teacher, she
said this individual making

23:57.467 --> 24:03.200
these threats,
these moves, is a cop.

24:03.233 --> 24:07.700
Did she give you a
name, any kind of proof?

24:07.733 --> 24:10.233
She said...

24:10.267 --> 24:13.233
No, nothing
really, but --

24:13.267 --> 24:17.067
Detective, I will vouch for
members of this department.

24:17.067 --> 24:20.733
I can't see any of
them going dirty.

24:20.767 --> 24:22.733
What about him?

24:22.767 --> 24:26.400
Agent McGee is highly decorated,
with a sterling reputation.

24:26.433 --> 24:28.667
He's on our side,
not theirs.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.700
If we're going to figure
out who this guy is,

24:30.733 --> 24:33.200
we need to be looking
in the right places.

24:33.233 --> 24:35.400
Let's focus
on doing that.

24:44.067 --> 24:46.367
Thank you for coming.

24:46.400 --> 24:50.533
You wrote me such a nice
invitation, how could I resist?

24:50.567 --> 24:57.067
I can't talk to Allison,
it's pointless. I know that.

24:57.100 --> 25:02.567
I thought you and I could
have a real conversation.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.300
About what?

25:05.333 --> 25:11.300
My wife.
My kids.

25:11.333 --> 25:13.833
You start.

25:16.467 --> 25:20.367
I'm not even going to pretend
that I didn't mess up.

25:20.400 --> 25:25.933
That I don't wish that
things were different.

25:25.967 --> 25:29.233
Good start.

25:29.267 --> 25:35.233
I want to do right by
you. By all of you.

25:35.267 --> 25:38.300
By giving your sister crap every
time she tries to help you?

25:38.333 --> 25:41.900
You don't think that
she tells me what you do,

25:41.933 --> 25:43.800
what you say?

25:43.833 --> 25:46.733
You don't think I
see her heart break?

25:46.767 --> 25:48.467
Her heart doesn't break.

25:48.500 --> 25:50.100
You can pretend whatever
you want to pretend.

25:50.133 --> 25:50.967
She had --

25:51.067 --> 25:52.700
But don't tell me
what my wife --

25:52.733 --> 25:55.267
You listen to me!

25:55.300 --> 25:58.167
Sorry.

26:01.467 --> 26:04.133
This is important.

26:04.167 --> 26:06.533
Yes it is.

26:06.567 --> 26:09.467
Nothing means as
much to me as my kids.

26:09.500 --> 26:13.300
Me too.

26:13.333 --> 26:20.433
And Jackie, she's gonna find a
place, and a program, a job.

26:20.467 --> 26:24.433
Yeah, I recommended
her to a friend of mine.

26:24.467 --> 26:26.967
He's leaning
towards hiring her.

26:27.067 --> 26:30.633
Thanks.
Thank you.

26:30.667 --> 26:32.867
I appreciate it.

26:32.900 --> 26:36.933
Because when she gets that
part of it coming together,

26:36.967 --> 26:39.800
then it'll be that much
easier for her and the kids

26:39.833 --> 26:42.667
to get on their own,
where they belong.

26:42.700 --> 26:47.767
Wait a sec. Where they belong
is somewhere stable and safe.

26:47.800 --> 26:52.067
Like exactly
where they are.

26:52.067 --> 26:55.300
Your house?

26:56.633 --> 27:02.900
I thought Allison was crazy when
she said we should take them in.

27:02.933 --> 27:06.233
But I love those kids.

27:06.267 --> 27:10.067
And I'm not gonna let them go
anywhere until I'm sure that

27:10.067 --> 27:12.167
they're going to be
happy and safe,

27:12.200 --> 27:15.233
and that goes
for Jackie, too.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.433
You trying to steal
my whole family?

27:17.467 --> 27:20.833
No, I'm just taking care of your
kids the way you should have.

27:20.867 --> 27:22.100
You don't know!

27:22.133 --> 27:23.933
You want a fight?
You got it.

27:23.967 --> 27:25.667
Because you're such a
better man than me?

27:25.700 --> 27:28.800
And that's
such a high bar.

27:33.967 --> 27:36.067
The drugs are coming in tomorrow
night to the freightyard.

27:36.067 --> 27:37.700
All of our intel
points to it.

27:37.733 --> 27:39.667
No cars can come
in to and from it,

27:39.700 --> 27:42.600
and all directions with
trails going off this way.

27:42.633 --> 27:45.367
And from here, all
roads lead to Crestview.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.833
I talked to some day workers
who said they were offered a

27:47.867 --> 27:49.900
huge payday to show up
there tomorrow night for an

27:49.933 --> 27:52.700
unloading, as long as they
didn't ask any questions.

27:52.733 --> 27:55.200
And we have rail lines
scheduled to stop there at

27:55.233 --> 27:58.367
five, the time that our yoga
teacher said the shipment

27:58.400 --> 28:00.067
was being dropped off.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.833
Shouldn't we be looking at
other places, too?

28:01.867 --> 28:04.133
Like private air
strips, or truck stops?

28:04.167 --> 28:06.733
Hardly anyone uses trucks
for this kind of haul anymore.

28:06.767 --> 28:08.400
They don't want to
risk getting pulled over.

28:08.433 --> 28:10.567
And the railroad
fits the pattern.

28:10.600 --> 28:13.433
The network we cracked in
Tacoma did the same thing.

28:13.467 --> 28:17.500
Pulled right into Union Station
not thinking anyone was looking.

28:17.533 --> 28:20.467
So we've got ourselves
a time, and a location.

28:20.500 --> 28:23.100
I'm gonna get my people on
the horn for some assistance.

28:23.133 --> 28:25.400
We're going to need
some bigger guns here.

28:25.433 --> 28:27.067
You can use my office.

28:27.067 --> 28:28.800
Thanks.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.500
You think we
missed something?

28:39.533 --> 28:42.333
No, I'm sure they're right. I
mean we need to trust

28:42.367 --> 28:45.367
the experts every now
and then, don't we?

28:55.633 --> 28:58.500
Cameron, I'm sorry, but I
might be a little late to the

28:58.533 --> 29:00.067
banquet tomorrow night.

29:00.100 --> 29:01.300
Work thing?

29:01.333 --> 29:03.400
Yeah, but I'll get
there as soon as I can.

29:03.433 --> 29:05.533
It starts at six, right?

29:05.567 --> 29:07.400
Yeah.

29:07.433 --> 29:09.167
I'll be there early, Cam.

29:09.200 --> 29:14.733
It's so much fun getting to know
the other moms and your coach.

29:14.767 --> 29:17.633
I'm really proud
of you, honey.

29:17.667 --> 29:20.633
I can help, too, Mom.

29:20.667 --> 29:22.733
What do you still need
to do for the banquet?

29:22.767 --> 29:25.900
Nothing. I'm on top of it.
I don't need any help.

29:31.200 --> 29:35.733
I just mean that I've
got it covered so...

29:35.767 --> 29:37.700
Anyone who wants to
help can just tell

29:37.733 --> 29:39.800
me what a good
job I'm doing.

29:39.833 --> 29:44.133
And you are, Mom.
A great, great job.

29:44.167 --> 29:47.067
Thank you, honey.

29:48.733 --> 29:50.333
We'll follow
Agent McGee's lead.

29:50.367 --> 29:52.967
Get to the rail yard and make
sure the ground support is in

29:53.067 --> 29:54.467
position before we
go for the grab.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.467
I have a strike team meeting us
on the way, and I've got an air

29:57.500 --> 29:59.867
unit that'll fly in as soon
as I give them the signal.

29:59.900 --> 30:01.833
Let's remember we're
dealing with someone who is

30:01.867 --> 30:03.667
responsible for at
least one death.

30:03.700 --> 30:05.733
We need to make sure we
don't lose anybody else.

30:05.767 --> 30:07.867
I won't let
that happen again.

30:07.900 --> 30:09.800
Everyone cool?

30:09.833 --> 30:15.600
Okay, then.
Let's get it done.

30:29.600 --> 30:32.867
We've got every move planned
out, every contingency covered.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.700
It'll be a solid operation.

30:35.733 --> 30:38.400
I'm not thinking about
the bust, it's McGee.

30:38.433 --> 30:40.333
How sure he
is of everything.

30:40.367 --> 30:43.033
He's a Fed. Those big-shots
are always three words

30:43.067 --> 30:46.467
away from telling us that
federal trumps state.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.400
But I've been impressed
with his work.

30:48.433 --> 30:51.000
It's thanks to him you
and I get to help take down

30:51.033 --> 30:53.633
Crestview's own
Rollo Tomassi.

30:53.667 --> 30:56.733
Rollo Tomassi?
Who called him that?

30:56.767 --> 30:57.800
Well, that got a reaction.

30:57.833 --> 30:59.733
Devin, who called him
that? Was it McGee?

30:59.767 --> 31:02.700
Pete.

31:02.733 --> 31:05.900
Turn the car
around. Now!

31:13.167 --> 31:15.200
You going to tell me
what you just put together?

31:15.233 --> 31:18.067
Pam told me this cop came to
her and told her that he was

31:18.100 --> 31:20.200
going to become Crestview's
own Rollo Tomassi.

31:20.233 --> 31:21.967
A Cop? Why didn't
you tell me?

31:22.067 --> 31:25.700
I'm still trying to figure it
out. I didn't tell anybody.

31:25.733 --> 31:27.933
But how would Pete
know, unless...

31:27.967 --> 31:29.367
He told it to
her himself?

31:29.400 --> 31:31.433
Yes! And did you notice
how eager he was to

31:31.467 --> 31:32.800
come back in from
his vacation?

31:32.833 --> 31:35.267
To tell us to go to the train
yard, instead of where

31:35.300 --> 31:36.733
the drugs are
actually going to be?

31:36.767 --> 31:37.633
Which is...?

31:37.667 --> 31:39.433
A place that's easy
to drop in cargo.

31:39.467 --> 31:42.200
And nobody thought
of it until Pete did.

31:42.233 --> 31:45.067
Inspired detective work.

31:47.633 --> 31:50.067
Lieutenant?
It's McLean.

31:54.567 --> 31:55.433
Jackie.

31:55.467 --> 31:57.467
Coach. Don't the
balloons look great?

31:57.500 --> 31:59.700
Very nice. But right now, I'm
trying to find out where

31:59.733 --> 32:01.367
you put the centerpiece
for the head table.

32:01.400 --> 32:04.367
No one can find them.

32:04.400 --> 32:08.700
Thank you. I'll have someone
go to the florist right now.

32:08.733 --> 32:11.333
Coach, I am so
terribly sorry, I was

32:14.900 --> 32:16.367
Mom, did you
type this out?

32:16.400 --> 32:20.200
I did. I'm trying to be the
best track mom I can be.

32:20.233 --> 32:23.100
What is this? Best New
Athlete, Cameron Olson.

32:23.133 --> 32:25.300
Presented by
Jackie Olson.

32:25.333 --> 32:28.533
I know. I typed it up.
I am so proud of you!

32:28.567 --> 32:31.800
Aunt Allison was supposed
to present me my award.

32:31.833 --> 32:34.167
That's what I filled out
on the form Coach gave me.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.333
I know. I saw the form
and I changed it.

32:36.367 --> 32:38.367
You only put Aunt Allison there
because you didn't know

32:38.400 --> 32:39.367
If I would be here.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.067
No!

32:42.867 --> 32:49.067
She was going to do it because
you weren't here. And she was.

32:49.067 --> 32:55.067
When I was earning this.
When I needed her.

32:56.400 --> 32:57.067
Baby...

32:57.067 --> 33:00.067
Don't touch me!

34:03.767 --> 34:06.633
Looks like the delivery's
right on time.

34:06.933 --> 34:09.133
Hurry it up. Gotta get this
thing back in the air,

34:09.167 --> 34:11.500
I've got a schedule to keep.

34:15.600 --> 34:19.133
I give backup five minutes,
then I'm taking him out myself.

34:41.533 --> 34:43.933
We're going or
he'll get away.

34:45.067 --> 34:46.600
Okay, cover me.

34:58.433 --> 35:01.500
Step away from
the plane, Pete.

35:05.533 --> 35:09.700
Allison. I guess if anybody
was going to figure this out,

35:09.733 --> 35:12.067
it was bound to be you.

35:12.100 --> 35:16.167
I'm not alone!
You're surrounded!

35:17.833 --> 35:19.700
Explain it to me, Pete.

35:19.733 --> 35:21.333
Why would you do
this to the department?

35:21.367 --> 35:22.433
To your friends?

35:22.467 --> 35:24.267
To the people of Crestview
whose lives are going to be

35:24.300 --> 35:26.167
ruined after the
stuff hits the streets?

35:26.200 --> 35:29.533
Yeah, right and wrong is
always so clear to you, huh?

35:29.567 --> 35:31.633
It's about the
law, Pete.

35:31.667 --> 35:34.300
You're the
expert on that, right?

35:34.333 --> 35:37.200
In fact, you taught me
so much of what I know.

35:37.233 --> 35:41.633
Like never give a criminal a
chance to grab their weapon.

35:41.667 --> 35:43.300
That was great advice.

36:11.667 --> 36:13.667
I'm out.

36:32.267 --> 36:36.133
It's over, Pete. Let's not make
this worse than it already is.

36:36.167 --> 36:38.400
It'll be over when
I say so, Allison.

36:38.433 --> 36:41.067
I'll shoot you,
if I have to.

36:41.067 --> 36:43.667
Is that how you
want this to end?

36:43.700 --> 36:48.300
Cop Kills Cop. That's a
headline to remember.

36:48.333 --> 36:52.267
And I'll finally have my
picture next to yours.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.067
I didn't say I was
going to kill you.

37:17.100 --> 37:18.600
Maybe we should
let him bleed.

37:18.633 --> 37:20.567
Take his chances
until back-up arrives.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.233
No, I want
him to survive.

37:22.267 --> 37:24.433
I don't want him to miss
his chance to enjoy prison.

37:24.467 --> 37:27.967
They're going to love a
cop like you in there.

37:35.067 --> 37:38.667
...because that's what school
sports should really be about,

37:38.700 --> 37:43.467
growing, and learning,
and developing.

37:59.633 --> 38:01.800
I'm so proud of you.

38:05.367 --> 38:07.067
I don't know
where Jackie is.

38:07.067 --> 38:10.067
She might be backstage helping
somebody, I don't know.

38:19.067 --> 38:20.767
Hey!

38:20.800 --> 38:23.933
Can we talk about
the kids now, please?

38:23.967 --> 38:25.767
These beautiful kids,
like my boy, Cameron.

38:25.800 --> 38:26.667
I love you!

38:28.500 --> 38:30.067
I love you.

38:30.067 --> 38:34.867
No! We're going
to miss the... come on!

38:46.533 --> 38:49.633
Here you go.

38:49.667 --> 38:52.067
No, I don't like coffee.

38:52.067 --> 38:53.967
Take the coffee,
Jackie.

38:54.067 --> 38:56.433
If you don't drink that coffee
right now, I'm going to call

38:56.467 --> 38:58.867
your rehab counsellor and he's
going to come pick you up. Which

38:58.900 --> 39:01.067
only seems fair, since you
just broke Cameron's heart.

39:01.067 --> 39:02.267
I did not --

39:02.300 --> 39:05.067
Just get yourself together long
enough to watch him accept

39:05.100 --> 39:07.767
his award, then we'll go
home and then we'll talk.

39:07.800 --> 39:10.200
Oh, you mean, we'll go home and
you can tell me how

39:10.233 --> 39:12.867
horrible I am at everything?

39:12.900 --> 39:18.600
And how much better the two of
you are than me at everything?

39:18.633 --> 39:22.667
You know, you expect
too much from me.

39:22.700 --> 39:25.067
And now you're trying to
steal my children.

39:25.067 --> 39:26.933
No, we're trying
to give them a home.

39:26.967 --> 39:29.433
With some stability
and some security.

39:29.467 --> 39:31.233
And a lot of love.

39:31.267 --> 39:33.267
Cameron's in there, waiting.

39:33.300 --> 39:35.933
He should be so happy and
proud of what he's done since

39:35.967 --> 39:38.933
he came here, but instead
he's worrying about you.

39:38.967 --> 39:40.733
About what you're
gonna do next.

39:40.767 --> 39:42.167
Tonight was supposed
to be about him

39:42.200 --> 39:44.933
and you've made
it all about you.

39:46.467 --> 39:49.667
That's not what I wanted.

39:49.700 --> 39:51.733
But that's
what you did.

39:51.767 --> 39:54.300
What are you going
to do to fix it?

40:02.133 --> 40:04.200
As a freshman,
Beck said to me:

40:04.233 --> 40:08.500
that looks like fun.
Can I try that?

40:08.533 --> 40:12.233
And she now holds the county
record in the long jump.

40:12.267 --> 40:14.767
And she grins
every time she jumps.

40:14.800 --> 40:18.000
Glad it's still
fun for you Becky.

40:21.800 --> 40:23.933
Congratulations.

40:26.567 --> 40:28.733
And our next award...

40:28.767 --> 40:33.233
Best New Athlete goes to
a very special young man,

40:33.267 --> 40:35.867
Cameron Olson.

40:41.767 --> 40:44.300
Cameron?

40:52.433 --> 40:53.733
Hello?

40:53.767 --> 40:56.700
Cameron?

40:56.800 --> 40:58.500
Hey Jeff!

40:58.533 --> 41:00.233
Oh, I didn't even
see you come in.

41:00.267 --> 41:01.500
Where is everybody?

41:01.533 --> 41:04.167
I think the girls
are on the porch.

41:05.267 --> 41:08.500
You're home already?
How was the banquet?

41:08.533 --> 41:10.467
Mom.

41:10.500 --> 41:11.600
Where's Cameron?

41:11.633 --> 41:13.133
At the banquet with you?

41:13.167 --> 41:14.300
What happened?

41:14.333 --> 41:15.567
Mariah, can you
check your phone,

41:15.600 --> 41:16.967
see if your
brother texted you.

41:17.067 --> 41:18.467
Dad.
What's going on?

41:18.500 --> 41:21.133
We had a problem
at the banquet.

41:21.167 --> 41:25.833
Mom. What happened?

41:25.867 --> 41:28.600
Cameron left
before we did.

41:32.533 --> 41:37.067
Let's sit you down, let
you take a minute.

41:39.367 --> 41:42.500
It's all my fault.
I ruined everything.

41:42.533 --> 41:44.233
I didn't mean to,
but I did.

41:44.267 --> 41:52.567
It's all right, Mom.
Everything will be all right.

41:52.600 --> 41:55.267
I found his shirt
and tie on his bed.

41:55.300 --> 41:58.300
We didn't see him come in.
We've been outside...

41:58.333 --> 42:00.533
I didn't hear
him Mom, honest.

42:00.567 --> 42:02.667
I'm sure he
didn't want you to.

42:02.700 --> 42:07.100
His duffle bag is missing
and most of his clothes.

42:08.067 --> 42:11.700
Cameron ran away?
