00:15.792 --> 00:17.083
Hmm. You see?

00:17.125 --> 00:18.834
See what?

00:18.875 --> 00:20.417
- The guy.

00:18.875 --> 00:20.417
- Who?

00:20.458 --> 00:23.000
- Guy in back.

00:20.458 --> 00:23.000
- The black guy?

00:23.041 --> 00:25.125
- Janet, don't be racist.

00:23.041 --> 00:25.125
- What?

00:25.166 --> 00:27.041
- You see guy in back?

00:25.166 --> 00:27.041
- Yeah.

00:27.375 --> 00:30.458
- What you think?

00:27.375 --> 00:30.458
- Steal or no steal?

00:30.500 --> 00:32.667
- You saw him

00:30.500 --> 00:32.667
take something?

00:30.500 --> 00:32.667
- No.

00:32.709 --> 00:34.041
Because,

00:32.709 --> 00:34.041
he does no steal.

00:35.125 --> 00:38.625
He does no steal because

00:35.125 --> 00:38.625
he's a black guy, brown shoes.

00:38.959 --> 00:41.500
He's not gonna steal

00:38.959 --> 00:41.500
'cause he's a black guy

00:38.959 --> 00:41.500
with brown shoes on?

00:41.542 --> 00:44.083
Black guy, brown shoes,

00:41.542 --> 00:44.083
that's a no steal.

00:44.125 --> 00:45.542
That's a cancel out combo.

00:45.583 --> 00:47.000
- Cancel out combo.

00:45.583 --> 00:47.000
- Got it.

00:47.709 --> 00:50.166
One day

00:47.709 --> 00:50.166
you take over store,

00:47.709 --> 00:50.166
you have to know,

00:50.208 --> 00:51.208
steal or no steal.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.166
I'm not taking over

00:51.250 --> 00:53.166
the store. Ever.

00:53.208 --> 00:55.583
White guy, white shoes,

00:53.208 --> 00:55.583
that's a steal.

00:55.625 --> 00:58.125
Brown woman, blue jacket,

00:55.625 --> 00:58.125
that's a no steal.

00:59.542 --> 01:02.709
But lesbian,

00:59.542 --> 01:02.709
that's girl

00:59.542 --> 01:02.709

01:02.750 --> 01:06.333
if she whistling...

01:02.750 --> 01:06.333
(WHISTLES)

01:02.750 --> 01:06.333
She's a steal.

01:06.792 --> 01:10.375
But two lesbian,

01:06.792 --> 01:10.375
surprise, no steal.

01:10.417 --> 01:12.917
Even if whistling.

01:10.417 --> 01:12.917
Cancel out combo.

01:13.583 --> 01:15.667
What about

01:13.583 --> 01:15.667
a fat Asian gay man

01:13.583 --> 01:15.667
with long straight hair,

01:15.709 --> 01:18.041
and a black lesbian

01:15.709 --> 01:18.041
with a ponytail

01:15.709 --> 01:18.041
and cowboy boots.

01:18.083 --> 01:19.667
Together.

01:18.083 --> 01:19.667
Steal or no steal?

01:20.667 --> 01:22.583
- That's impossible.

01:20.667 --> 01:22.583
- What's impossible?

01:22.625 --> 01:25.291
The fat, Asian, gay?

01:22.625 --> 01:25.291
Appa, there are Asians

01:22.625 --> 01:25.291
who're gay, you know.

01:25.333 --> 01:28.041
I know.

01:25.333 --> 01:28.041
But Asian gay

01:25.333 --> 01:28.041
is never fat.

01:28.083 --> 01:30.583
Only skinny Asian

01:28.083 --> 01:30.583
is the gay. That's rule.

01:30.625 --> 01:32.500
That's how they

01:30.625 --> 01:32.500
doing like that. Yeah.

01:33.917 --> 01:35.959

01:54.750 --> 01:58.834

01:54.750 --> 01:58.834

01:58.875 --> 02:01.500
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Perfect.

02:02.375 --> 02:04.417
No, no, tell her nothing.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.917
It'll be surprise.

02:07.291 --> 02:10.125
Okay, I will.

You too. Bye-bye.

Oh, Mrs. Lee.

Her daughter Grace

02:16.041 --> 02:18.041

02:18.083 --> 02:19.125
I'm helping planning visit.

02:19.792 --> 02:21.083
Hmm.

02:21.125 --> 02:24.000
So why you look like a cat

02:21.125 --> 02:24.000
with mouse in you mouth?

02:24.041 --> 02:26.417
Mouth in my mouse?

02:24.041 --> 02:26.417

02:24.041 --> 02:26.417

02:31.875 --> 02:34.875
Okay, I will. Bye-bye."

02:35.959 --> 02:38.291
You shouldn't listen

02:35.959 --> 02:38.291
to private conversation.

02:38.542 --> 02:40.792
You shouldn't have

Stop!

We're going nowhere.

02:53.583 --> 02:55.250

- Gerald,

02:55.959 --> 02:58.208
you say to me.

02:55.959 --> 02:58.208
- Don't.

02:58.792 --> 03:00.500
Gerald.

02:58.792 --> 03:00.500
Uh...

03:00.542 --> 03:01.709
If it were up

03:00.542 --> 03:01.709
to just me,

03:01.750 --> 03:03.959
I would tell you,

03:01.750 --> 03:03.959
but for Janet...

03:01.750 --> 03:03.959
Tell.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.083
- Don't tell.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.083
- Talk.

03:05.125 --> 03:06.166
- Don't talk.

03:05.125 --> 03:06.166
- Gerald.

03:06.709 --> 03:08.041
Uh, can we...

03:06.709 --> 03:08.041
Can we just go?

03:08.333 --> 03:10.000
- Don't go.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.000
- You don't go.

03:10.375 --> 03:11.458
Thanks.

03:17.125 --> 03:18.875
Hey, Jung.

03:18.917 --> 03:21.834
When you have a chance

03:18.917 --> 03:21.834
can you please pull these

03:21.875 --> 03:23.000
Yeah, sure.

03:25.917 --> 03:28.333
So, how's it going?

03:25.917 --> 03:28.333
Anything new with you?

03:29.333 --> 03:30.917
No, not really.

03:32.125 --> 03:34.709
- Did you get a haircut?

03:32.125 --> 03:34.709
- Nope.

03:35.208 --> 03:37.792
- Same old me.

03:35.208 --> 03:37.792
- Same old me too.

JUNG: Hey.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.709
Hi.

03:55.583 --> 03:56.917
How'd you know

03:55.583 --> 03:56.917
I work here?

03:57.208 --> 03:59.375
- You work here?

03:57.208 --> 03:59.375
- Isn't that why

03:57.208 --> 03:59.375
you're here?

03:59.417 --> 04:00.834
- In Toronto?

03:59.417 --> 04:00.834
- No, I mean

04:00.875 --> 04:03.458
why are you here, here,

04:00.875 --> 04:03.458
at the car rental?

04:03.959 --> 04:05.250
To rent a car.

04:06.709 --> 04:08.208
Right, yeah, sorry.

04:06.709 --> 04:08.208
I'm just surprised

04:06.709 --> 04:08.208
to see you.

04:08.959 --> 04:10.500
I thought you lived

04:08.959 --> 04:10.500
in Vancouver.

04:08.959 --> 04:10.500
I do.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.583
That's why I need to

04:11.125 --> 04:12.583
rent a car here.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.250
And my umma

04:12.834 --> 04:14.250
told me that...

04:14.291 --> 04:16.667
That my umma told her that

04:14.291 --> 04:16.667
this was the place to come.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.750
- Yeah.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.750
- Yep.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.875
Terence.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.875
This is Terence.

04:22.917 --> 04:24.667
I feel like maybe

04:22.917 --> 04:24.667
he should help you out.

04:25.750 --> 04:27.166
Probably for the best.

04:27.208 --> 04:29.875
Terence, this is Grace Lee.

04:27.208 --> 04:29.875
She'd like to rent a car.

04:30.583 --> 04:32.041
Great. You've come

04:30.583 --> 04:32.041
to the right place.

04:34.834 --> 04:37.333
- Hey, everything okay?

04:34.834 --> 04:37.333
- All right,

04:34.834 --> 04:37.333
be honest with me.

04:37.375 --> 04:38.917
Did I look like

04:37.375 --> 04:38.917
a complete idiot

04:37.375 --> 04:38.917
out there?

04:39.458 --> 04:41.750
No. You couldn't look like

04:39.458 --> 04:41.750
an idiot if you tried.

04:41.792 --> 04:43.709
- Seems like I was

04:41.792 --> 04:43.709
trying pretty hard.

04:41.792 --> 04:43.709
- What'd I miss?

04:44.041 --> 04:46.041
- Grace Lee.

04:44.041 --> 04:46.041
- No.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.959
- Yeah.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.959
- She's here

04:46.083 --> 04:47.959
in the office?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.583
An ex-girlfriend?

(CHUCKLES)

04:53.875 --> 04:56.375
Who didn't?

04:56.834 --> 04:59.291
- I wouldn't say

04:56.834 --> 04:59.291
as much dating as...

04:56.834 --> 04:59.291
- Kimch!

04:59.834 --> 05:02.208
I was just gonna say

04:59.834 --> 05:02.208
it was mostly sex.

05:02.250 --> 05:03.291
- Okay.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.250
Let's keep things

05:03.333 --> 05:05.250
professional here.

05:05.291 --> 05:08.583
I know how hard it can be

05:05.291 --> 05:08.583
to run into someone

05:05.291 --> 05:08.583
at the workplace

05:08.625 --> 05:10.417
that you have

05:08.625 --> 05:10.417
feelings for...

05:08.625 --> 05:10.417
Well...

05:10.792 --> 05:12.917
Or did. Or still do?

05:12.959 --> 05:15.667
Hey, why's she here?

05:12.959 --> 05:15.667
I thought she hated you.

05:15.917 --> 05:17.750
I think my umma's

05:15.917 --> 05:17.750
still trying to

05:15.917 --> 05:17.750
get us back together.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.834
That explains why your

05:18.000 --> 05:20.834
umma called asking what time

05:18.000 --> 05:20.834
you were working today.

05:20.875 --> 05:23.834
Why didn't you tell me?

05:20.875 --> 05:23.834
Dude, I'm not

05:20.875 --> 05:23.834
your secretary.

05:24.542 --> 05:26.542
I should talk to her.

05:24.542 --> 05:26.542
Well, there are

05:24.542 --> 05:26.542
other options,

05:26.583 --> 05:29.000
but who am I to stand

05:26.583 --> 05:29.000
in the way of love?

05:26.583 --> 05:29.000

05:30.834 --> 05:32.917

05:30.834 --> 05:32.917

06:16.750 --> 06:17.834
- Discount?

06:16.750 --> 06:17.834
- Mmm-hmm.

06:18.083 --> 06:19.792
- Cool?

06:18.083 --> 06:19.792
- Aeeshcham.

06:20.834 --> 06:22.625
Hapkido is

06:20.834 --> 06:22.625
a serious, Janet.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.417
- Seriously?

06:22.667 --> 06:24.417
- Yeah, seriously.

06:24.458 --> 06:25.667
No, Appa, are you

06:24.458 --> 06:25.667
being serious?

06:25.709 --> 06:27.458
Yeah, this is

06:25.709 --> 06:27.458
my serious face.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.417
It's pretty serious.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.417
That's your serious face?

06:29.458 --> 06:31.458
Yah, what you talking?

06:29.458 --> 06:31.458
I'm talking about

06:29.458 --> 06:31.458
serious things, Appa.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.083
Yeah, me too!

06:31.500 --> 06:34.083
All right then! I'm glad

06:31.500 --> 06:34.083
we got that sorted out.

06:34.125 --> 06:36.291
Stop! (SIGHS)

06:36.709 --> 06:39.875
Okay, okay,

06:36.709 --> 06:39.875
you don't have

06:36.709 --> 06:39.875
to beg to me.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.792
I will teach

06:40.333 --> 06:41.792
to you Hapkido.

06:41.834 --> 06:44.834
I've asked you, like,

06:41.834 --> 06:44.834
100 times about Hapkido

06:44.875 --> 06:46.750
and you always said no

06:44.875 --> 06:46.750
because I was a girl.

06:46.792 --> 06:49.542
And now that another man is

06:46.792 --> 06:49.542
teaching me, you're jealous?

06:49.583 --> 06:52.333
- So jealous.

06:49.583 --> 06:52.333
- I'm not jealous.

06:52.625 --> 06:55.041
When you is girl,

06:52.625 --> 06:55.041
you is too fat,

06:55.083 --> 06:56.667
can't even bend arm,

06:57.250 --> 07:00.333
- but now you is

06:57.250 --> 07:00.333
ready to learn.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.333
- Whatever. We're fine.

07:00.375 --> 07:01.667
We like our

07:00.375 --> 07:01.667
Hapkido teacher.

07:01.709 --> 07:03.333
Who is you

07:01.709 --> 07:03.333
Hapkido teacher?

07:03.375 --> 07:05.166
- His name is...

07:03.375 --> 07:05.166
- I think he's like

07:03.375 --> 07:05.166
an art teacher.

07:05.208 --> 07:07.125
You art teacher

07:05.208 --> 07:07.125
pimping Korea?

07:07.166 --> 07:10.000
- Uh...

07:07.166 --> 07:10.000
- No, no, no,

07:07.166 --> 07:10.000
can't having like that.

07:10.041 --> 07:12.542
Only Korean can teach

07:10.041 --> 07:12.542
a Korean Hapkido.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.333
- Show us

07:13.583 --> 07:15.333
what you learn.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.333
- Okay.

07:15.709 --> 07:17.667
Uh, so, this is

07:15.709 --> 07:17.667
a wrist lock.

07:17.917 --> 07:20.792
Grab me here

07:17.917 --> 07:20.792
and then I just do...

07:20.834 --> 07:21.959
Ow!

07:22.000 --> 07:25.125
(LAUGHING)

07:22.000 --> 07:25.125
Girl, that is

07:22.000 --> 07:25.125
so painful!

07:25.166 --> 07:27.291
I'm so sorry,

07:25.166 --> 07:27.291
I didn't mean

07:25.166 --> 07:27.291
to hurt you.

07:27.333 --> 07:28.959
You have

07:27.333 --> 07:28.959
to be careful, Janet.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.709
I'm getting older and weaker

07:29.000 --> 07:31.709
just like your father here.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.000
What you talking?

07:34.041 --> 07:37.500
Uh, Gerald,

07:34.041 --> 07:37.500
try something on me.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.667
Oh, no, it's okay,

07:37.792 --> 07:39.667
Mr. Kim,

07:39.709 --> 07:42.166
I think I'm might

07:39.709 --> 07:42.166
purchase one of these

07:42.208 --> 07:43.542
freezers...

07:42.208 --> 07:43.542
Okay.

07:43.583 --> 07:45.208
I'm going to

07:43.583 --> 07:45.208
attack you slowly.

07:45.542 --> 07:47.917
You better doing

07:45.542 --> 07:47.917
some Hapkido

07:45.542 --> 07:47.917
or you gonna get hurt.

07:47.959 --> 07:50.250
Please.

07:47.959 --> 07:50.250
I attack with

07:47.959 --> 07:50.250
my left hand. Huh?

07:50.792 --> 07:52.500
Here I come Gerald.

07:50.792 --> 07:52.500
Oh, so slow.

07:53.166 --> 07:54.500
What I do, Hapkido

07:53.166 --> 07:54.500
save me please.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.625
Okay, Mr. Kim!

07:55.667 --> 07:57.583
(YELLS)

07:57.875 --> 07:59.000
(GROANING)

08:01.583 --> 08:05.041
Are you okay?

08:01.583 --> 08:05.041
I just got the wind

08:01.583 --> 08:05.041
knocked out of me

08:05.083 --> 08:06.667
through this

08:05.083 --> 08:06.667
new hole in my back.

08:08.125 --> 08:09.208
Hey.

08:09.625 --> 08:10.709
Hey.

08:12.458 --> 08:13.875
So that was weird.

08:12.458 --> 08:13.875
Back there.

08:13.917 --> 08:16.500
Yeah, it was.

08:13.917 --> 08:16.500
But whatever.

08:17.166 --> 08:19.542
Listen, I just

08:17.166 --> 08:19.542
wanted to say sorry.

08:20.583 --> 08:21.834
About what happened

08:20.583 --> 08:21.834
in high school.

08:22.709 --> 08:23.792
What happened

08:22.709 --> 08:23.792
in high school?

08:24.834 --> 08:26.917
The thing I did

08:24.834 --> 08:26.917
to make you hate me.

08:27.333 --> 08:29.917
You're gonna have to be

08:27.333 --> 08:29.917
a bit more specific than that.

08:30.375 --> 08:34.250
I remember, uh,

08:30.375 --> 08:34.250
going to your house

08:30.375 --> 08:34.250
for a family dinner.

08:34.834 --> 08:37.375
I think I had

08:34.834 --> 08:37.375
a little vodka

08:34.834 --> 08:37.375
before I showed up.

08:37.417 --> 08:38.750
More than a little.

08:38.792 --> 08:41.041
I remember

08:38.792 --> 08:41.041
punching a tree...

08:38.792 --> 08:41.041
That was my uncle.

08:41.083 --> 08:44.041
I also remember

08:41.083 --> 08:44.041
throwing up on a tree.

08:41.083 --> 08:44.041
Also my uncle.

08:44.083 --> 08:45.583
You really

08:44.083 --> 08:45.583
don't remember that?

08:45.625 --> 08:47.542
I know I was

08:45.625 --> 08:47.542
a bit of an idiot.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.250
Yeah, you were.

08:50.417 --> 08:52.500
So, you pretty busy

08:50.417 --> 08:52.500
while you're here?

08:52.542 --> 08:53.917
Lots of meetings.

08:55.166 --> 08:56.500
So you're all booked up?

08:58.125 --> 09:00.792
You know, if you're

08:58.125 --> 09:00.792
gonna ask me out,

08:58.125 --> 09:00.792
you better hurry up,

09:00.834 --> 09:02.500
'cause I charge

09:00.834 --> 09:02.500
by the hour.

09:00.834 --> 09:02.500
(LAUGHS)

09:02.542 --> 09:05.041
That didn't sound good.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.041
I meant charge you,

09:05.083 --> 09:06.750
'cause I'm a lawyer

09:05.083 --> 09:06.750
and not a sex stripper...

09:06.792 --> 09:09.000
Will you go to dinner

09:06.792 --> 09:09.000
with me tonight?

09:11.542 --> 09:12.625
Yes.

09:14.667 --> 09:18.625
Why don't you give me

09:14.667 --> 09:18.625
a call when you

09:14.667 --> 09:18.625
finish all your meetings.

09:19.709 --> 09:21.875
I'll have one of my

09:19.709 --> 09:21.875
many assistants call you.

09:25.917 --> 09:27.000
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

09:27.041 --> 09:28.125
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

09:30.500 --> 09:32.166
Wait, I didn't check

09:30.500 --> 09:32.166
the car for dents!

09:32.625 --> 09:34.458
Don't worry, Terence.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.458
I won't tell Shannon.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.291
I better tell Shannon.

09:38.834 --> 09:41.125
Appa,

09:38.834 --> 09:41.125
what's your problem?

09:41.166 --> 09:42.875
MR. CHIN:

09:41.166 --> 09:42.875
Holy shit, Mr. Kim!

09:42.917 --> 09:46.333
You is Bruce Lee and Jet Li

09:42.917 --> 09:46.333
all rolled up into

09:42.917 --> 09:46.333
one plump Korean.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.375
Gerald, you okay?

09:46.375 --> 09:48.375
Yeah, I'm all right.

09:48.417 --> 09:50.375
You centre of gravity

09:48.417 --> 09:50.375
is too high.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.417
Have to bend knee.

09:52.709 --> 09:55.542
Feet is where power

09:52.709 --> 09:55.542
come from. Like a tree.

09:55.834 --> 09:58.875
Deep root. Big fruit.

09:55.834 --> 09:58.875
You understand?

09:59.542 --> 10:02.792
Not really.

09:59.542 --> 10:02.792
Why you

09:59.542 --> 10:02.792
doing like this?

10:02.834 --> 10:04.083
That's how I was taught.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.542
No, you have to do

10:04.125 --> 10:05.542
like this way.

10:05.583 --> 10:08.375
(GROANS)

10:05.583 --> 10:08.375
Yeah,

10:05.583 --> 10:08.375
it's better techniques.

10:08.417 --> 10:09.667
You feel that?

10:08.417 --> 10:09.667
Yeah. Yeah.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.041
Argh!

10:09.709 --> 10:11.041
That's how you

10:09.709 --> 10:11.041
supposed to be feeling.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.458
Appa, stop.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.458
You're showing off.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.041
I'm not showing off...

10:12.500 --> 10:15.041
It does work better.

10:15.667 --> 10:16.917
That's the way

10:15.667 --> 10:16.917
our teacher teaches it

10:16.959 --> 10:18.458
so that's how

10:16.959 --> 10:18.458
we're gonna learn it.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.917
I am like a TTC,

10:18.500 --> 10:20.917
the better way.

10:20.959 --> 10:24.041
You should challenge

10:20.959 --> 10:24.041
their teacher

10:20.959 --> 10:24.041
to a Hapkido duel

10:24.083 --> 10:26.375
to prove whose

10:24.083 --> 10:26.375
fighting technique

10:24.083 --> 10:26.375
is superior.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.458
He's too busy

10:26.792 --> 10:28.458
beating up Gerald.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.250
Just a friendly contest.

10:30.291 --> 10:32.917
You teacher could learn

10:30.291 --> 10:32.917
lots from me.

10:32.959 --> 10:34.417
He teach you all wrong.

10:35.250 --> 10:36.417
Don't tell me,

10:35.250 --> 10:36.417
tell him.

10:37.250 --> 10:38.333
Maybe I will.

10:40.250 --> 10:41.583
Maybe you should.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.125
Come on, Gerald.

10:53.583 --> 10:57.083
I miss it, 'cause there's

10:53.583 --> 10:57.083
no real Koreatown

10:53.583 --> 10:57.083
in Vancouver.

10:57.583 --> 11:00.083
I mean,

10:57.583 --> 11:00.083
there's a splash of it

10:57.583 --> 11:00.083
in the West End

11:00.125 --> 11:02.542
but we're all up in

11:00.125 --> 11:02.542
Coquitlam, Burnaby...

11:02.834 --> 11:04.333
- The 'burbs.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.333
- Yeah.

11:05.125 --> 11:06.500
Here seems

11:05.125 --> 11:06.500
like the same old.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.667
Yeah, Koreatown

11:06.542 --> 11:08.667
is still Koreatown.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.417
But North York

11:08.709 --> 11:10.417
is coming on strong.

11:10.458 --> 11:13.000
- Ah. North Koreatown.

11:10.458 --> 11:13.000
- Yeah.

11:13.291 --> 11:15.041
Though Persians

11:13.291 --> 11:15.041
are definitely moving in.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.166
Hey, is that crappy little

11:15.500 --> 11:18.166
strip mall still up there

11:15.500 --> 11:18.166
by Sheppard?

11:18.208 --> 11:20.291
You mean the one

11:18.208 --> 11:20.291
where you almost

11:18.208 --> 11:20.291
got a tattoo?

11:20.333 --> 11:22.291
- What do you mean almost?

11:20.333 --> 11:22.291
- You're joking.

11:23.291 --> 11:24.291
Am I?

11:26.750 --> 11:29.041
- Good evening.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.041
- A table for Lee, Grace.

11:30.083 --> 11:31.959
Yes, your other guests

11:30.083 --> 11:31.959
have arrived.

11:46.375 --> 11:48.375
What are you

11:46.375 --> 11:48.375
doing here, Mom?

11:48.417 --> 11:50.709
She always call me Mom

11:48.417 --> 11:50.709
when she is mad.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.542
How did you know we were

11:50.750 --> 11:52.542
gonna eat here, Umma?

11:52.583 --> 11:55.500
- He always calls me Umma

11:52.583 --> 11:55.500
when he is...

11:52.583 --> 11:55.500
- Umma, please.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.250
- Pastor Choi tell us.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.250
- How did

11:56.083 --> 11:58.250
Pastor Choi know?

11:58.583 --> 12:01.291
- He say he hear

11:58.583 --> 12:01.291
from Eddie Chan.

11:58.583 --> 12:01.291
- Who's Eddie Chan?

12:01.542 --> 12:03.375
You know, Eddie Chan.

12:01.542 --> 12:03.375
He cleans up at the church.

12:03.417 --> 12:04.458
Eddie Chan.

12:06.041 --> 12:08.291

12:10.583 --> 12:14.291
Kimchee's mom,

12:10.583 --> 12:14.291
Mrs. Han, owns Number 1

12:10.583 --> 12:14.291

12:14.333 --> 12:17.208
Look guys, no offence,

12:14.333 --> 12:17.208
but this is a private dinner.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.750
Please. Listen

12:17.250 --> 12:19.750
for two second

12:17.250 --> 12:19.750
and then we go.

12:24.875 --> 12:28.375
Long distance relationship is

12:24.875 --> 12:28.375
very hard for young people.

12:28.417 --> 12:32.291
But we is here to help

12:28.417 --> 12:32.291
in early time until you

12:28.417 --> 12:32.291
move to same city.

12:32.542 --> 12:34.417
Grace is a lawyer,

12:32.542 --> 12:34.417
make more money.

12:34.458 --> 12:35.709
But she is not virgin

12:34.458 --> 12:35.709
anymore.

12:36.417 --> 12:39.166
- Umma!

12:36.417 --> 12:39.166
- And Jung is cool,

12:36.417 --> 12:39.166
fun guy.

12:39.208 --> 12:40.750
But he is working

12:39.208 --> 12:40.750
at car rental.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.500
So, it is good match

12:41.333 --> 12:43.500
we think.

12:44.375 --> 12:46.625
Every city

12:44.375 --> 12:46.625
have car rental

12:44.375 --> 12:46.625
so you can work.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.750
Every city have crime,

12:47.208 --> 12:49.750
so you can work.

12:51.333 --> 12:53.417
This is what

12:51.333 --> 12:53.417
we is thinking.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.500
This is way

12:53.458 --> 12:55.500
over the line,

12:53.458 --> 12:55.500
Umma.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.333
This is why

12:56.041 --> 12:58.333
I moved to Vancouver.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.333
Because of this.

12:59.208 --> 13:00.208
Sorry, Jung.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.458
Happy?

13:01.750 --> 13:03.458
No.

13:03.709 --> 13:05.458
Don't worry,

13:03.709 --> 13:05.458

13:05.709 --> 13:07.625
Don't talk

13:05.709 --> 13:07.625
We're done here.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.333

13:24.875 --> 13:27.792
Lift arm higher.

13:24.875 --> 13:27.792
No, bend knee.

13:28.125 --> 13:29.667
Yeah. Good...

13:30.583 --> 13:32.125
Mr. Kim, I'm not sure

13:30.583 --> 13:32.125
this is a good idea.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.500
No, no, Gerald.

13:33.542 --> 13:36.333
I think we all want to hear

13:33.542 --> 13:36.333
what we're doing wrong.

13:36.375 --> 13:37.458
Yeah.

13:38.750 --> 13:39.959
That's Master Yang.

13:42.208 --> 13:45.041
Go on, Appa. Why don't you

13:42.208 --> 13:45.041
teach him a lesson in Hapkido?

13:45.083 --> 13:47.959
Why you tell to me

13:45.083 --> 13:47.959
your Hapkido teacher

13:45.083 --> 13:47.959

13:48.000 --> 13:49.917
Technically he's

13:48.000 --> 13:49.917

13:49.959 --> 13:52.166
Why you not tell to me

13:49.959 --> 13:52.166

13:52.208 --> 13:54.208
You never asked

13:52.208 --> 13:54.208
'cause you never ask.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.333
Your plan is going

13:54.834 --> 13:56.333
to backfire.

13:56.375 --> 13:57.625
How?

13:57.667 --> 14:00.917
When he kill me, you have

13:57.667 --> 14:00.917
to take over store.

14:00.959 --> 14:02.000
JUNG: Grace.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.333

14:02.709 --> 14:04.333

14:04.375 --> 14:05.375
Yeah.

14:05.709 --> 14:06.959
They're never

14:05.709 --> 14:06.959

20:05.333 --> 20:08.125
Yeah, maybe Japanese

20:05.333 --> 20:08.125
invent that too.

20:22.417 --> 20:24.583
<i>I'm Chan Ling.</i>

20:22.417 --> 20:24.583
<i>I'm good at kung fu.</i>

20:25.750 --> 20:27.834
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

20:25.750 --> 20:27.834
<i>but we are full now.</i>

20:28.667 --> 20:31.458
Where did you get this?

20:28.667 --> 20:31.458
Mr. Chin give to me.

20:31.792 --> 20:34.750
It's a little confuse

20:31.792 --> 20:34.750
but kung fu is very good.

20:34.792 --> 20:35.792
Very authentic.

20:39.291 --> 20:40.375
Huh, see?

20:41.625 --> 20:43.000
He's fighting

20:41.625 --> 20:43.000
upside down

20:41.625 --> 20:43.000
on the ceiling.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.000
Yeah, it is very authentic

20:43.041 --> 20:45.000
for fighting lizard-style.

20:45.375 --> 20:48.166
Hmm. Maybe we should call

20:45.375 --> 20:48.166
Lionel Richie style.

20:48.208 --> 20:49.875
(LAUGHING)

20:48.208 --> 20:49.875
What?

20:50.417 --> 20:52.959
Because he is

20:50.417 --> 20:52.959
dance on the ceiling.

20:53.542 --> 20:55.417
Is good joke

20:53.542 --> 20:55.417
if you is old.

20:55.458 --> 20:56.875
Yeah, maybe.

20:56.917 --> 20:59.375
You know you should have

20:56.917 --> 20:59.375
close up 45 minute ago.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.333
Shh.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.333
You ruin movie.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.166
Don't forget to lock door.

21:09.208 --> 21:10.792
How does the fire

21:09.208 --> 21:10.792
not burn their feet?

21:11.792 --> 21:13.041
I can teach to you.

21:13.959 --> 21:15.917
It's okay. I'm good.

21:17.917 --> 21:19.458
(LAUGHING)

21:20.333 --> 21:22.000
He's on fire now.

21:23.041 --> 21:24.709
Yeah, he's not careful.
