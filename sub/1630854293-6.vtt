WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:03.177
Previously on <i>SWAT...</i>

00:04.526 --> 00:06.180
I want to have
Previousla family with you.

00:06.180 --> 00:08.486
We're-we're...
we're having a girl.

00:08.486 --> 00:09.618
Mmm.
Mmm.

00:09.618 --> 00:10.836
Powell, with me!

00:10.836 --> 00:12.099
- I got a shortcut.
- Powell!

00:12.099 --> 00:16.146
Suspect's down.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.452
You just take off like that.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.541
Relax. We got the guy,
didn't we?

00:20.933 --> 00:24.024
You get Powell squared away.
She's your responsibility now.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.678
Hank St. John. I go by Saint.

00:26.678 --> 00:28.811
Daniel Jr. They call me... I know who you are, Hondo.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.595
You may have them fooled,
but not me.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.554
It's only gonna take
one mistake for the LAPD

00:32.554 --> 00:34.077
to come knocking on your door.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.297
I'll have
to be very careful then.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.081
This is Detective Rios
with Gangs and Narcotics.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.691
If you're right about this Saint
guy being behind all this...

00:39.691 --> 00:41.867
I am....we haven't found any evidence

00:41.867 --> 00:43.043
to confirm it.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.435
I just wanted to ask you

00:44.435 --> 00:45.915
about your new business venture
with Hank St. John.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.482
Starting my first business.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.875
I'm calling it
Freshness on Wheels.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.355
Consider it a fair warning.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.140
Clean up your act,
or you're gonna see me

00:53.140 --> 00:55.316
in ways that you don't want to.

01:00.016 --> 01:02.062
Oh, Hondo, look how cute.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.585
Oh, no.

01:03.585 --> 01:06.109
Get out of town. Our baby girl
ain't even born yet,

01:06.109 --> 01:07.415
and she's already
swagging it out.

01:07.415 --> 01:09.678
This stuff looks
practically new.

01:09.678 --> 01:13.682
- Has it ever even been worn?
- Uh, most of it, probably not.

01:13.682 --> 01:16.250
Yeah, Annie went a little
overboard dressing the girls.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.426
How could she not?
It's all so precious.

01:18.426 --> 01:21.342
Yeah. I'm actually surprised
she let this go.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.039
But when she heard

01:23.039 --> 01:25.868
that the two of you
were having a baby, and a girl,

01:25.868 --> 01:27.261
here it is.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.610
Well, Deacon, thank you.
It means a lot.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.133
Now you tell Annie
that we promise

01:30.133 --> 01:31.482
to give everything here
a good home.

01:31.482 --> 01:32.918
You're doing usa favor.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.572
Victoria's almost four.

01:34.572 --> 01:36.574
You know, it's about time
we move on to the next phase.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.010
- What do you mean?
- Well, we have this joke

01:38.010 --> 01:39.099
that we have lived through

01:39.099 --> 01:40.578
different phases over the years.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.580
First, it was the
"Just the two of us" phase.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.321
Then it was,
"We've got one kid.

01:44.321 --> 01:46.410
I think that's all
we can handle" phase.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.151
Our "Just the two of us" phase
was pretty great.

01:48.151 --> 01:50.153
You ready to shake that up?

01:50.153 --> 01:51.459
I am more than ready.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.678
Oh, you better be,
because pretty soon,

01:53.678 --> 01:55.724
it turns into the
"Now, we have four kids

01:55.724 --> 01:57.291
"and we couldn't believe
that we thought

01:57.291 --> 01:58.901
one was too much
- to handle" phase.
- Yeah.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.642
- Hmm.
- You know what?
I think we'll leave that phase

02:00.642 --> 02:02.165
to you and Annie
'cause I really don't see

02:02.165 --> 02:03.775
four little rug rats
- running around here.
- Uh-uh.

02:05.168 --> 02:07.692
Victoria used to
love stuffies,

02:07.692 --> 02:10.260
but by the time this one came
home, she was onto dolls.

02:10.260 --> 02:12.044
Next, it'll be boys.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.655
- Ooh.
- Which phase is that?

02:13.655 --> 02:15.352
That is
the "Lord, help me" phase.

02:16.788 --> 02:19.443
Oh, sorry, guys.
Excuse me for a second.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.185
Yo, Rios. What's up?

02:22.185 --> 02:23.621
Yo, Hondo.

02:23.621 --> 02:24.927
Yeah, I couldn't help it.
Had to call right away.

02:24.927 --> 02:26.581
I think we got him.
We may have found

02:26.581 --> 02:28.278
what we need
to put Saint away for good.

02:28.278 --> 02:30.106
What? You serious?
What'd you find?

02:30.106 --> 02:32.195
Picked up a laptop on a raid
of one of Saint's pill mills

02:32.195 --> 02:33.762
last night.
Guys at Cyber Division

02:33.762 --> 02:36.504
say it's encrypted
like nothing they've ever seen.

02:36.504 --> 02:37.983
And if that thing has
that much security...

02:37.983 --> 02:39.811
Got to be a gold mine, yeah.
Problem is,

02:39.811 --> 02:41.813
we're locked out of it
until this raid.

02:41.813 --> 02:43.598
- You found the key?
- Don't get your hopes up.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.643
Still got to see
what's on the laptop first,

02:45.643 --> 02:48.298
but my gut is telling me it's
what we've been searching for.

02:48.298 --> 02:49.647
I'll keep you posted.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.649
Hey, Rios, thanks, man.

02:51.649 --> 02:54.304
You stepped up and walked this
path because I asked you to.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.001
- I owe you.
- Yeah, let's save the mushy stuff

02:56.001 --> 02:57.786
for when we have Saint
in cuffs, okay?

02:57.786 --> 02:59.831
I'm so looking forward to that.

02:59.831 --> 03:00.963
Thanks, brother.

03:00.963 --> 03:02.269
All right, peace.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.231
Good news?

03:08.231 --> 03:09.928
Rios just hit up another one
of Saint's stash houses, and

03:09.928 --> 03:11.756
he thinks that he finally has
enough evidence to put him away.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.932
- Well, that's huge.
- We're not there yet.

03:13.932 --> 03:16.848
We got to confirm it, but, yeah,
this feels really good.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.676
Well, we should go.

03:18.676 --> 03:20.417
Then I'll save
my congratulations for later.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.941
Can't wait. Mmm.
See you tonight.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.247
- Okay.
- Bye.

03:24.247 --> 03:26.684
Deacon, please thank Annie
for all this.

03:26.684 --> 03:27.816
I will.

03:27.816 --> 03:28.991
Bye.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.302
Hey.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.520
Here you go.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.348
- Thank you.
- No problem.

03:40.611 --> 03:41.960
Charlie, what the hell is this?

03:41.960 --> 03:43.701
Celery, kale,
spinach and apple.

03:43.701 --> 03:45.703
Mom told you to watch
your caffeine intake,

03:45.703 --> 03:47.270
so I got you
a healthy juice.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.316
You're killing me, <i>mijo,</i> okay?

03:52.014 --> 03:54.843

You know, I spent a lot
of time in this room

04:26.570 --> 04:28.311
when I first got to SWAT.

04:28.311 --> 04:30.095
It's almost a rite of passage.

04:30.095 --> 04:33.055
Is that why you suggested
to Hondo I get armory duty?

04:33.055 --> 04:34.709
Nostalgia?

04:34.709 --> 04:37.320
You got armory duty 'cause
you were reckless in the field.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.930
Now, I know you trust your gut,

04:38.930 --> 04:40.889
but you can't keep
going off on your own.

04:40.889 --> 04:43.065
There's a reason
we move in twos.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.067
Your partner's not just
watching your back.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.373
You're watching theirs.

04:46.373 --> 04:47.852
I get it.
You could've just said that.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.506
You didn't have to get Hondo
to sideline me.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.769
You want me to lay off?

04:51.769 --> 04:53.293
Stop reverting back
to the lone wolf stuff.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.946
I didn't ask you
to be my mentor,

04:54.946 --> 04:57.471
or whatever it is
you think you're doing.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.777
Can I get back to it?

04:59.777 --> 05:03.041
These HKs aren't gonna
clean themselves.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.404
MAN [on radio]:
I mean, you look at his
production from last season,

05:17.404 --> 05:19.623
his numbers are obviously down.
Does that worry you at all?

05:19.623 --> 05:21.364
I mean, not particularly.

05:21.364 --> 05:23.366
Look, let me rephrase it.

05:23.366 --> 05:27.936
Is Bailey seeing a lot more
double team this year? Yeah.

05:59.402 --> 06:00.882
Move! Move!

06:03.885 --> 06:05.190
This is Detective Alex Rios.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.932
I'm at the corner
of West 60th and South Hoover.

06:07.932 --> 06:11.675
Code 30. Officer
in need of assistance!

06:14.330 --> 06:18.160
Hey, you notice anything funny
about the commander today?

06:18.160 --> 06:20.554
Funny? Hicks is a lot of things,
I don't know about funny.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.599
No, I mean, like, weird.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.035
He was on the bike
in the gym this morning.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.863
And?
Hicks hates
the stationary bike.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.865
He says
it's the perfect metaphor

06:27.865 --> 06:29.476
for going nowhere in life.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.913
I'm telling you, man,
something's off.

06:33.131 --> 06:35.046
Hey. Morning, Commander.

06:35.046 --> 06:36.221
Tan. Luca.

06:36.221 --> 06:39.050
Hey, sir.

06:42.271 --> 06:45.579
At ease, boys.

06:46.449 --> 06:49.147
- Was that a kombucha?
- I told you. Weird.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.326
Kale salad?

06:54.326 --> 06:56.241
I don't think I've ever seen
Hicks eat a vegetable.

06:56.241 --> 06:57.547
Not unless it was surrounded

06:57.547 --> 06:58.896
by meat and smashed
on a hoagie roll.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.245
Maybe he's on some sort
of health kick.

07:00.245 --> 07:02.683
- That's a good thing, right?
- I don't know.

07:02.683 --> 07:05.729
My dad went on a health kick
when he was Hicks's age

07:05.729 --> 07:08.428
on the doctor's orders after
he had a mild heart attack.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.125
Hey.

07:10.125 --> 07:13.737
Hondo called. Detective Rios
radioed a Code 30.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.478
He was attacked in his car.
Now he's gone.

07:15.478 --> 07:16.827
Hondo and Deacon
are on their way there.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.438
Said we should do
what we can from here.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.570
Okay, let's get some leads
for them for when they get back.

07:31.929 --> 07:34.932
All right. Thank you.

07:34.932 --> 07:37.195
Detectives canvassed
the block.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.197
These guys weren't discrete.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.025
Witnesses saw two masked men
armed with assault rifles

07:41.025 --> 07:44.289
yank Rios from his car,
threw him in the back of a Jeep.

07:44.289 --> 07:47.162
He was blindsided.
Rios didn't stand a chance.

07:47.162 --> 07:50.818
- He was targeted.
- Yeah, looks like it.

07:51.645 --> 07:52.950
I sent him
down this road, Deacon.

07:52.950 --> 07:55.126
Hey, Hondo,
this isn't on you.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.606
I talked Rios
into going after Saint.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.216
It's no coincidence
that Rios was real close

07:58.216 --> 07:59.435
to putting Saint away.

07:59.435 --> 08:00.958
- Now he gets ambushed?
- All right, let's...

08:00.958 --> 08:02.525
let's not jump
to conclusions.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.309
There's only one
possible conclusion.

08:04.309 --> 08:06.964
Saint kidnapped Rios.

08:07.791 --> 08:10.577
And you best believe
I'm gonna get him back.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.182
This mean I'm out
of the doghouse?

08:51.182 --> 08:53.576
For now. This is
an all-hands situation.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.752
One of our own is abducted
in broad daylight.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.754
Somebody must
have seen something.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.756
Well, the traffic cam
gave us plates from the Jeep

08:59.756 --> 09:01.802
that sideswiped Rios,
but it was a dead end.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.978
It was reported stolen from
a parking lot this morning.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.719
No cameras at the lots,
so no help there.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.764
Any progress
on our perps?
No, sir.

09:07.764 --> 09:10.680
They were masked and moved too
fast to get a good description.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.987
Average height, average build,
nothing concrete.

09:12.987 --> 09:14.815
Why take Rios now?

09:14.815 --> 09:16.686
Well, Rios has been hitting
Saint's pill mills

09:16.686 --> 09:18.514
and stash houses
pretty hard recently.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.081
One last night
and one this morning.

09:20.081 --> 09:22.605
Unlikely it's just revenge,
or we would have found a body

09:22.605 --> 09:24.172
instead of just
a banged-up car.

09:24.172 --> 09:28.959
Well, the big get from
last night's raid was a laptop.

09:28.959 --> 09:31.353
Rios seems to think
that this is the holy grail,

09:31.353 --> 09:32.789
some kind of digital locker

09:32.789 --> 09:34.617
where Saint keeps
all his dirty laundry.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.532
I tracked the laptop
to Cyber Division.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.012
Anything in it
we can use?

09:38.012 --> 09:39.883
Cyber's been trying
to crack it all night.

09:39.883 --> 09:41.537
It's highly encrypted.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.539
Sounds like maybe Rios is right
about what's on it.

09:43.539 --> 09:44.975
All right, both of you
head down to Cyber

09:44.975 --> 09:47.282
and see what you can glean
from the techs.

09:51.199 --> 09:54.768
Hey, Commander,
the R-100 detail is bringing

09:54.768 --> 09:57.379
Rios' wife, Maria,
into HQ for protection.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.120
Their son, Charlie,
is on patrol.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.643
We radioed him
and he should be back soon.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.558
My God,
the wife must be a wreck.

10:02.558 --> 10:04.865
- Yeah.
- Oh, I-I got to take this.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.214
Hey, Doc.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.955
Yeah?

10:09.086 --> 10:10.697
Oh, wow. I didn't expect it

10:10.697 --> 10:12.307
to get scheduled that soon.

10:12.307 --> 10:16.267
All right, I guess it gives me
less time to get nervous.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.052
Okay. Well, all right.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.444
Thank you.
You hear that?

10:19.444 --> 10:21.055
Hicks has something
scheduled with a doctor.

10:21.055 --> 10:24.058
Should we say something to him,
let him know we're here for him?

10:24.058 --> 10:26.060
I don't know. Hicks is
a pretty private guy.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.410
If he wanted us to know,
he would have told us.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.630
Yeah, but whatever it is,
there's no reason

10:30.630 --> 10:32.414
for him to be
going through it alone

10:32.414 --> 10:34.242
when so many people care.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.461
If the commander needs us,
he'll let us know.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.072
I say we give him
his space for now.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.378
I hope you're right.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.560
<i>You see, Ellis,</i>

10:52.260 --> 10:54.436
the middle game
<i>You see</i> like a magician,

10:56.786 --> 11:00.921
You think very highly
of yourself, don't you, Hank?an,

11:00.921 --> 11:03.097
But I...

11:03.097 --> 11:05.447
Mate.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.451
Sergeant Harrelson.
Here for a game?

11:09.451 --> 11:11.018
You know exactly why I'm here.

11:11.018 --> 11:13.150
That's probably why
you stepped up your security.

11:13.150 --> 11:16.110
This is my executive assistant,

11:16.110 --> 11:17.546
Lucius.

11:17.546 --> 11:18.765
I'm surprised you two
haven't met yet.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.636
A police officer
was abducted this morning.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.594
I'm truly sorry to hear that.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.074
What can I do to help?

11:24.074 --> 11:26.337
If you give me
a name, I...You know his name,

11:26.337 --> 11:29.471
and that he was real close
to shutting down your operation.

11:29.471 --> 11:32.126
My operation? I run
a successful business

11:32.126 --> 11:33.693
that gives back

11:33.693 --> 11:35.390
to the community
at every turn.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.087
Who would want
- to shut that down?
- That's just a cover.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.959
Rios found proof,
so you kidnapped him.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.961
Now, where is he?!

11:40.961 --> 11:43.224
I've been here

11:43.224 --> 11:45.705
with Councilman Wright
playing chess all morning.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.142
I appreciate that
you have a job to do,

11:48.142 --> 11:51.014
but you're barking up
the wrong tree.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.887
Cut the act, Saint!

11:55.715 --> 11:57.804
Where is Detective Rios?

12:00.502 --> 12:03.461
Hondo, let's go.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.118
Come on. This isn't
accomplishing anything.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.865
Anything useful?
Maybe.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.824
I've been going through the
evidence logs from last night

12:17.824 --> 12:19.826
and this morning's raids,
and I just found this.

12:19.826 --> 12:22.524
This thumb drive
was photographed

12:22.524 --> 12:24.526
and logged in
at the stash house this morning,

12:24.526 --> 12:26.180
but it never made it
to the evidence locker.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.399
Okay, Forensics didn't find it
in the debris at the crash site

12:28.399 --> 12:30.140
or in Rios' car.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.576
I don't know how it fits,

12:31.576 --> 12:33.056
but it could be
another piece of the puzzle.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.841
All right, I'll send a team
to double check the car.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.886
Street and Powell are
headed over to Cyber now.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.932
Give them the heads up
to ask about this drive.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.324
Yes, sir. Uh, Commander, wait.

12:41.151 --> 12:44.894
If there's ever anything
that you need to talk about,

12:44.894 --> 12:46.766
I just want you
to know I'm here.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.638
All right, well,
that's good to know, Luca.

12:49.638 --> 12:52.423
- I'll-I'll keep that in mind.
- I mean it, sir.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.774
- Anything.
- All right.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.299
I-I'm sorry, Luca.
Excuse me.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.996
Hey, Hondo, hold up.

12:59.996 --> 13:02.042
I just got a call
from the deputy mayor's office.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.392
Did you threaten
Hank St. John in the park?

13:04.392 --> 13:06.089
No, sir. I was
chasing a lead.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.265
Well, it didn't look that way
to City Councilman Ellis Wright,

13:08.265 --> 13:09.614
and he's got strong ties both

13:09.614 --> 13:10.920
with the deputy mayor
and the I.G.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.183
Sir, you're gonna slap my wrist?

13:13.183 --> 13:14.968
Now? With Rios out there?

13:14.968 --> 13:17.057
I'm on your side here.
We all want Rios

13:17.057 --> 13:18.841
to be brought home safely,
all right?

13:18.841 --> 13:21.017
I'm just reminding you
to be smart about this.

13:21.017 --> 13:23.498
You keep going after Saint
without any proof, then...

13:23.498 --> 13:25.979
Then what?
He'll kill Rios?

13:25.979 --> 13:27.719
Sir, he's gonna
do that anyway

13:27.719 --> 13:30.374
as soon as he gets
- what he wants.
- Uh...

13:30.374 --> 13:31.898
Mrs. Rios.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.595
What?

13:33.595 --> 13:35.162
I'm Commander Hicks.

13:35.162 --> 13:37.425
I'm so sorry.

13:37.425 --> 13:38.643
If you come
with me, I'll...

13:38.643 --> 13:40.558
I'll explain to you
what's going on.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.822
Okay? Come on.
Come with me.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.795
We called earlier. GND brought
in a laptop last night.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.884
It was seized
in a drug raid. Yeah.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.451
You must be from 20-Squad.

14:03.451 --> 14:05.627
I was the one who processed it
when it came in.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.194
Pretty heavy security mods.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.282
Air-gapped.

14:08.282 --> 14:09.631
No wireless connection.

14:09.631 --> 14:10.893
Could only see metadata,
but it's huge.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.069
14 terabytes,
all highly encrypted.

14:13.069 --> 14:14.810
You still haven't been able
to figure out what's on it?

14:14.810 --> 14:16.029
If coffee and will power
were enough,

14:16.029 --> 14:17.508
I would have cracked it
hours ago.

14:17.508 --> 14:18.901
But we could throw every

14:18.901 --> 14:21.469
decryption algorithm
the LAPD has at it,

14:21.469 --> 14:22.818
and still probably not get in.

14:22.818 --> 14:24.515
It requires a specific key.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.691
Probably stored
on a flash drive.

14:26.691 --> 14:29.825
Something... like this?

14:29.825 --> 14:31.435
Exactly.
Wish I'd known you had it.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.002
Might've actually gotten
some sleep last night.

14:33.002 --> 14:35.700
Must be what Rios
called Hondo about this morning.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.006
Wait. Detective Rios?

14:37.006 --> 14:38.834
He called a couple hours ago,

14:38.834 --> 14:41.576
said he was on his way over.
Never showed.

14:42.533 --> 14:43.795
Rios must have been bringing

14:43.795 --> 14:45.710
the flash drive here himself,

14:45.710 --> 14:47.234
only he got ambushed on the way.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.931
Oh, my God.

14:49.758 --> 14:51.934
That flash drive
is only half the equation.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.937
The laptop is here.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.940
We need to move the laptop to
SWAT HQ for safekeeping now.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.551
As long as you sign it out
to maintain chain of custody.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.292
Just let me...

15:02.292 --> 15:03.946
Wait. This can't be right.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.948
It was checked out
a minute ago.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.515
Which way?

15:07.515 --> 15:08.864
Evidence room is down there.

15:11.214 --> 15:13.695
Hey, someone just
checked out a laptop?

15:13.695 --> 15:15.305
Uh, yeah.

15:15.305 --> 15:17.003
- He's right there.
- Hey!

15:17.003 --> 15:18.526
Stop right there!

15:30.886 --> 15:32.148
Do not move!

15:32.148 --> 15:33.758
- Hands where we can see 'em!
- Hands up!

15:33.758 --> 15:35.543
- - You don't understand.
- Right now!
- I'll cover.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.284
I got to get this
laptop out of here.

15:37.284 --> 15:38.372
Hands behind your back.
Up against the vehicle.

15:38.372 --> 15:39.677
- Now!
- They're gonna kill him.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.853
There's no time.
They're going to kill my dad

15:41.853 --> 15:42.985
if you don't let me go!

15:42.985 --> 15:44.334
Charlie Rios?

15:46.293 --> 15:47.555
What the hell's going on?

15:53.213 --> 15:55.171
Your pig father took a computer

15:55.171 --> 15:56.042
that doesn't belong to him.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.086
You're going to get it back.

15:57.086 --> 15:59.001
Your daddy's life depends on it.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.526
We found this
on Charlie's phone.

16:02.526 --> 16:05.268
They sent that
to Rios' son, Charlie?

16:05.268 --> 16:07.314
Poor kid was just trying
to save his dad.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.272
A laptop
for his father's life.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.883
Charlie could barely hold it
together. I feel for him.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.452
Oh, geez.

16:15.452 --> 16:17.759
Tell me we got
something to go on.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.980
We tried to track the phone
used to contact Charlie Rios,

16:20.980 --> 16:22.720
but it's a burner.
Signal's gone dead.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.853
Charlie had no idea
where the flash drive might be.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.986
Last time he saw it
was at the raid this morning.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.684
So we're back
- to square one?
- Maybe not.

16:29.684 --> 16:32.078
Play it again just from the end.

16:33.253 --> 16:35.820
Freeze. Zoom in on that box.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.258
Now sharpen it.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.521
So what am I looking at?

16:40.521 --> 16:42.131
I know that logo.

16:42.131 --> 16:44.438
That's Raymont Harris' company.

16:46.179 --> 16:47.702
Does this mean
I'm officially

16:47.702 --> 16:49.138
out of the armory now?

16:49.138 --> 16:50.835
Sorry. You got
- to do the full assignment.
- Come on.

16:50.835 --> 16:54.013
Rios and the laptop would
be long gone if not for me.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.580
You want a pat on the back?
Fine. Nice work.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.060
You're still on armory duty.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.888
What's in this for you?

16:59.888 --> 17:01.281
What do you mean?

17:01.281 --> 17:03.674
All the check-ins,
the hovering,

17:03.674 --> 17:05.720
the getting me armory duty.
Why are you doing this?

17:05.720 --> 17:10.812
Because I almost blew my shot
with SWAT once, and I would like

17:10.812 --> 17:12.031
to see you stick around.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.121
You're a good cop. Exactly.

17:16.861 --> 17:19.081
I am a good cop, which is why

17:19.081 --> 17:20.430
I don't need a mentor.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.650
I don't need you
to hold my hand.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.130
I can make it on my own.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.479
Yeah, but
that's the point, Powell.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.872
You don't have
to do this on your own.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.179
I appreciate the sentiment,

17:30.179 --> 17:33.095
but you got to give me space.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.402
Please.

17:39.188 --> 17:42.061
Raymont?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.801
Why aren't you picking up
your phone?

17:43.801 --> 17:45.107
My bad.
Been running around.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.674
Company's growing.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.502
Check out the new van.

17:48.502 --> 17:49.720
We need to talk.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.461
- Why? What's going on?
- It's about Saint.

17:51.461 --> 17:52.897
We've been through this, Hondo.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.377
Everything he's done

17:54.377 --> 17:56.249
for Freshness on Wheels
has been above board.

17:56.249 --> 17:58.294
Everything you know of, Raymont.

17:58.294 --> 18:00.209
I believe he's using
one of your warehouses

18:00.209 --> 18:02.733
to hide a detective
that he kidnapped.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.387
Saint? Kidnap a cop?

18:04.387 --> 18:05.997
Look, I know
how that sounds to you.

18:05.997 --> 18:09.827
His investment got my business
off the ground. Now I'm soaring.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.612
So, yeah, it sounds crazy to me.

18:11.612 --> 18:14.049
My girl Nichelle
helped you incorporate

18:14.049 --> 18:15.398
that symbol
into your branding, right?

18:15.398 --> 18:18.053
The Sankofa.
It represents the idea

18:18.053 --> 18:19.359
that no one is left behind.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.751
Okay, look at that.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.144
This is from a ransom video.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.841
That's your symbol right there.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.061
And that? That's Detective
Rios right now.

18:26.061 --> 18:28.237
This is real, kid.
He's been helping me

18:28.237 --> 18:29.804
take down Saint's
criminal empire.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.545
Rios is a good cop,
and if I'm right,

18:31.545 --> 18:33.329
he doesn't have
a lot of time left.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.682
We just bought a new warehouse.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.380
It's being renovated, but

18:40.380 --> 18:43.252
this morning, Saint's guy called
and gave the crew the day off.

18:43.252 --> 18:45.646
I need you to give me
that location.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.618
Luca, Tan, you're with me
on the one side.

19:01.618 --> 19:04.143
Street and Powell,
you take the three.

19:06.232 --> 19:09.670
Hondo says this is the warehouse
from the video.

19:09.670 --> 19:12.368
Be on the lookout
for two gunmen, maybe more.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.022
Tan give me eyes inside.

19:14.022 --> 19:15.806
Be on the lookout for Rios.

19:15.806 --> 19:18.287
Don't want him getting caught
in the crossfire.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.988
I'm not getting
any heat signatures.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.512
This place stores food, right?

19:25.512 --> 19:27.122
Industrial AC might be throwing
off the thermal imaging.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.298
30-David.
Nothing on the thermal image.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.605
We're gonna breach the one side,
go shallow to deep.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.215
Roger, 30-David.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.304
We'll watch the three side
for rabbits.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.524
Reinforced steal door.
Heavy duty.

19:44.357 --> 19:47.360
Breach in three, two, one.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.845
LAPD SWAT!

19:55.933 --> 19:58.197
Hallway clear.

19:59.372 --> 20:00.895
I got middle.

20:00.895 --> 20:02.897
Tan go left, Luca take right.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.377
Head on a swivel.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.470
Warehouse is empty.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.167
Street, Powell,

20:12.167 --> 20:13.473
anything?

20:13.473 --> 20:15.562
Nothing back here, either.
Making entry.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.884
This doesn't make any sense.

20:33.884 --> 20:36.235
There's nobody here.

20:44.112 --> 20:47.202
25-David.
I got something over here.

20:48.725 --> 20:51.206
This is where Rios was
hanging in the video.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.208
Fresh blood.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.384
Still hasn't dried.

21:00.215 --> 21:03.392
Looks like he was waterboarded.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.438
Still wet. Couldn't have
been sitting here long.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.091
We must've just missed them.

21:07.918 --> 21:10.530
Saint knew we were coming.
No way.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.749
How could he have known?

21:14.142 --> 21:15.926
Someone tipped him off.

21:21.105 --> 21:23.325
You're not doing yourself any
favors by not talking to me.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.979
You're the only one
who could've warned Saint.

21:24.979 --> 21:28.069
If we don't find Detective Rios
in time to save him,

21:28.069 --> 21:30.114
you can be charged
as an accessory.

21:30.114 --> 21:32.334
I know what you think of cops,

21:32.334 --> 21:34.380
but Hondo's a good one.
Saved my life.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.730
You can trust him.

21:36.730 --> 21:39.210
Phoebe, tell me what you know.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.343
Please.

21:42.431 --> 21:44.607
My brother Marcus
is Saint's driver.

21:44.607 --> 21:48.350
When I heard you talking
about raiding the warehouse,

21:48.350 --> 21:51.092
I got scared that
he might get hurt.

21:51.092 --> 21:53.573
So you called Marcus and
warned him that we were coming?

21:53.573 --> 21:56.358
Is he involved
with Saint's criminal activity?

21:56.358 --> 21:57.881
No.

21:57.881 --> 22:00.275
All he does is take him
to meetings and wait in the car.

22:00.275 --> 22:03.757
Your brother might be
in real danger, Phoebe.

22:03.757 --> 22:07.761
We both want the same thing--
to get our people home safely.

22:07.761 --> 22:09.850
Help me.

22:14.811 --> 22:17.466
Hey, Deac,
can I talk to you a minute?

22:17.466 --> 22:19.947
Yeah. I'm just running some gear
out to Betty. What's up?

22:19.947 --> 22:21.949
Hondo put me in charge
of getting Powell in line.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.777
How's that going?

22:23.777 --> 22:25.256
Not great.

22:25.256 --> 22:27.171
I'm just having trouble
getting through to her.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.348
Well, what have you tried?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.654
Encouragement,
self-deprecation, tough love.

22:31.654 --> 22:34.527
Everything you and Hondo used
on me in the beginning.

22:34.527 --> 22:37.443
Well, that's your problem
right there. She's not you.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.923
What do you mean? I was just
- like her when I got here.
- Look,

22:39.923 --> 22:42.622
I've got four kids. Each one
of them has a different father.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.624
Okay. You lost me.

22:44.624 --> 22:48.410
Wh-What I mean is, each one
of my kids is an individual.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.325
They respond to
parenting differently,

22:50.325 --> 22:52.327
so I-I have to take a different
approach with each one of 'em.

22:52.327 --> 22:53.981
The tough love that
I use on Matthew

22:53.981 --> 22:55.330
would never work on Lila.

22:55.330 --> 22:56.897
- Hmm.
- She's too smart for that.

22:56.897 --> 22:59.378
How did you figure out
what works best for each kid?

22:59.378 --> 23:03.207
Simple. I-I just listened,
I got to know 'em.

23:03.207 --> 23:06.167
How much do you actually
know about Powell?

23:06.167 --> 23:09.388
Not a ton. I mean,
she plays it pretty close,

23:09.388 --> 23:11.520
but she did tell me the reason

23:11.520 --> 23:13.522
that-that she doesn't trust
protocol is

23:13.522 --> 23:15.437
'cause
it got an old partner hurt.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.134
Okay, well, that's a start.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.136
How much does
she know about you?

23:19.136 --> 23:21.704
- Not much, I guess.
- Okay.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.445
You want Powell to open up,
let her guard down,

23:23.445 --> 23:26.230
you got to let
yours down first.

23:27.101 --> 23:29.669
- Make sense?
- Yeah. Yeah, it does.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.975
Thanks.

23:36.153 --> 23:37.807
Yes.

23:37.807 --> 23:39.026
I'm here.

23:39.026 --> 23:40.854
Where are you?

23:40.854 --> 23:42.508
Mm-hmm.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.032
Thanks, Marcus.

23:45.032 --> 23:46.990
Wait in the car.

23:57.523 --> 23:58.915
Hello?

23:58.915 --> 24:00.221
Marcus, you okay?

24:00.221 --> 24:02.092
Yeah, what's up?

24:02.092 --> 24:03.529
Where are you?

24:03.529 --> 24:04.704
I'm at the soup kitchen.

24:04.704 --> 24:06.401
Why?

24:06.401 --> 24:08.490
Marcus, this is
Sergeant Harrelson, LAPD SWAT.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.884
Phoebe is safe,
but you might be in danger.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.233
Are you with Saint right now?

24:12.233 --> 24:13.800
I mean, yeah, he's in a meeting.
He told me

24:13.800 --> 24:15.671
to wait in the car.
What-What's going on?

24:15.671 --> 24:18.369
Does anything look out of the
ordinary from where you are?

24:20.894 --> 24:22.069
Marcus?

24:22.069 --> 24:24.550
Phoebe, come on.
You know the cops

24:24.550 --> 24:26.508
are always messing with Saint.
I mean, think about

24:26.508 --> 24:28.945
what he does for the community.
He gave me a job to help pay

24:28.945 --> 24:30.294
for Pop's medical bills.

24:30.294 --> 24:31.905
No, they're not messing with him
this time.

24:31.905 --> 24:33.428
Saint kidnapped a cop.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.604
No, you're wrong.
He wouldn't do that.

24:35.604 --> 24:36.953
Now, I'll prove it.

24:36.953 --> 24:37.998
No. Marcus, Marcus,

24:37.998 --> 24:39.565
do not get out of that car!

24:39.565 --> 24:42.089
Marcus!

24:49.749 --> 24:52.534
It didn't have to come to this, Detective,

24:52.534 --> 24:55.581
but you've squeezed
my storage houses,

24:55.581 --> 24:58.279
chipped away
at my packaging facilities,

24:58.279 --> 25:01.456
so now we find ourselves here.

25:01.456 --> 25:04.981
I need my flash drive back.

25:04.981 --> 25:06.766
Where is it?

25:06.766 --> 25:08.985
Do you really have it in you
to kill a cop, Saint?

25:08.985 --> 25:11.771
Because you're gonna have to.

25:11.771 --> 25:13.947
I'll never tell you
where that drive is.

25:13.947 --> 25:16.210
You will.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.430
After all,
your family can only hide

25:19.430 --> 25:21.389
- from me for so long.
- You leave my family alone!

25:21.389 --> 25:22.956
You understand me?

25:22.956 --> 25:25.088
Ph-Phoebe? Phoebe.

25:25.088 --> 25:26.612
Yeah, you-you were right.

25:26.612 --> 25:29.484
There are men here.
One of 'em's all bloody.

25:29.484 --> 25:31.007
Marcus, listen to me.
You got to get out of there.

25:31.007 --> 25:33.140
Get out of there now.
You get back to that car.

25:33.140 --> 25:34.620
Do you understand?

25:34.620 --> 25:36.186
Yeah.

25:36.186 --> 25:39.494
Thought I heard
something. Come here.

25:40.364 --> 25:43.367
Marcus? Marcus. No, Marcus.

25:43.367 --> 25:46.501
Raymont, you and Phoebe,
you stay right here.

25:46.501 --> 25:48.634
We're gonna get
your brother back.

25:57.425 --> 26:01.211
Come on, man. I won't
tell nobody, all right? Please!

26:02.735 --> 26:06.216
I told you to stay
in the car.

26:07.914 --> 26:10.699
But it's okay, Marcus.

26:11.831 --> 26:14.355
Maybe this is for the best.

26:14.355 --> 26:15.835
Hey, you leave him alone.

26:15.835 --> 26:18.402
You may not value your own life,

26:18.402 --> 26:21.623
but certainly, you won't
let me kill this innocent boy.

26:21.623 --> 26:25.018
Mr. St. John, Saint,
please, please.

26:25.018 --> 26:27.194
Don't!
Where is it?

26:32.591 --> 26:34.288
- Time's up.
- No! No, no, no.

26:34.288 --> 26:36.725
- Please!
- Wait! Wait! Wait!
It's in my car.

26:38.074 --> 26:39.859
It's hidden in my car.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.861
That's where I stashed it.

26:41.861 --> 26:44.211
There.

26:44.211 --> 26:46.605
Was that so hard?

26:47.518 --> 26:49.216
Saint, Saint, come on, please.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.739
Please. I'm sorry.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.574
Hondo.

26:59.574 --> 27:01.054
You with us?

27:01.054 --> 27:02.490
Thinking about Rios.

27:02.490 --> 27:05.536
- We'll get him back.
- And what if we don't?

27:05.536 --> 27:08.757
I've been chasing that
son of a bitch for over a year.

27:08.757 --> 27:11.064
Every day looking
forward to the moment

27:11.064 --> 27:13.544
we finally slap cuffs on him.
There ain't no victory

27:13.544 --> 27:15.068
in busting him
for Rios' murder.

27:15.068 --> 27:18.811
Look, I saw how Saint got to you
at the park earlier.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.987
You're gonna be able
to keep your head

27:20.987 --> 27:23.293
if we are too late to save Rios?

27:25.034 --> 27:27.384
If we are too late for Rios,

27:27.384 --> 27:30.692
I am not letting his
sacrifice be for nothing.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.782
We take Saint down clean.

27:37.481 --> 27:39.570
Command to 20-David.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.660
Marcus' phone has left
the soup kitchen.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.358
Looks like Saint's on the move.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.926
He's heading north on Alvarado.

27:46.926 --> 27:50.712
Uh, check that.
Now west on Chavez.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.714
What should we do, Hondo? Stay
the course to the soup kitchen

27:52.714 --> 27:55.935
or call an audible
and follow the phone?

27:55.935 --> 27:57.458
Just 'cause Saint's in motion
doesn't mean Rios is with him.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.590
He's right.
There's no way

27:59.590 --> 28:01.114
to know
if they're still together.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.463
If Saint got what he wanted,

28:02.463 --> 28:03.856
he may be going
after that flash drive.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.379
I-I hate to say it,

28:05.379 --> 28:07.642
but if-if Rios
gave up the drive,

28:07.642 --> 28:09.862
there's a good chance
that Saint is fleeing a murder.

28:10.863 --> 28:13.692
What's your call, boss?

28:16.956 --> 28:19.741
Follow the phone, Luca.
Stay on Saint.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.656
Hey.

28:21.656 --> 28:22.701
You sure?

28:22.701 --> 28:25.921
No, but I better be right.

28:25.921 --> 28:27.531
Hang on!

28:43.547 --> 28:45.680
Excuse me, sir.
I need an alternator

28:45.680 --> 28:47.856
for a '73 Cadillac Brougham.

28:47.856 --> 28:49.858
Is there anyone here
who can help me?

28:49.858 --> 28:52.469
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to come back on Monday.

28:52.469 --> 28:55.516
- I'm the only one here.
- Unfortunate for you, I guess.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.309
Destroy the security tapes.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.398
- I want this clean.
- Okay.

29:41.257 --> 29:43.564
Come on.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.829
You didn't need
to bring the kid.

29:47.829 --> 29:49.875
The kid is my insurance
to keep you honest.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.617
His car's over there.

29:54.401 --> 29:57.578
Move.

30:02.452 --> 30:05.020
Now where's my flash drive?

30:05.020 --> 30:08.589
It's hidden
in the passenger seat headrest.

30:17.293 --> 30:19.426
A hole underneath. It's there.

30:19.426 --> 30:21.689
It better be.

30:23.517 --> 30:25.562
Got it.

30:28.304 --> 30:31.873
This little device could have
destroyed everything I've built.

30:33.962 --> 30:37.096
Dump the bodies.
Nothing traces back to me.

30:49.325 --> 30:51.414
Move!

30:58.900 --> 31:02.817
Okay, we've got two armed
suspects-- 10:00 and 2:00.

31:02.817 --> 31:04.166
Both suspects have hostages.

31:04.166 --> 31:05.951
Is one of them Rios?

31:07.735 --> 31:10.129
Yes, at your two.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.480
Hey, Saint's moving deeper
into the yard.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.655
Now, Street, Powell,
you get Rios and Marcus.

31:14.655 --> 31:16.091
Tan, you stay
with Luca.

31:16.091 --> 31:17.484
Deacon, give me two.
We're going after Saint.

31:17.484 --> 31:21.009
- Luca, we need cover.
- Got it!

31:21.009 --> 31:22.924
20-Squad, move. Move!

31:35.371 --> 31:38.505
Tan, watch out for one
of the suspects at your seven!

31:39.854 --> 31:42.161
25-David. First suspect down.

31:47.383 --> 31:50.604
LAPD! Drop the weapon!

31:50.604 --> 31:52.780
Drop it right now!
Up against the vehicle!

31:52.780 --> 31:54.651
Marcus, this way, quick!
Behind that vehicle.

31:54.651 --> 31:56.479
Go, Marcus!

31:56.479 --> 31:58.568
Up against the vehicle now!
Hands behind your back!

31:58.568 --> 32:01.789
Going hands on. Come here!

32:01.789 --> 32:04.661
26-David. Second suspect
in custody. Marcus is safe.

32:04.661 --> 32:07.534
Luca, talk to me. We need eyes.

32:08.622 --> 32:11.755
At your twelve. Grey sedan.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.544
Drop it!

32:18.545 --> 32:19.981
Move!

32:21.548 --> 32:23.202
Don't!

32:23.202 --> 32:24.812
Hands behind your back.

32:24.812 --> 32:27.467
Hands behind your back!

32:27.467 --> 32:28.990
We've got you, Detective.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.993
26-David.
Third suspect in custody.

32:31.993 --> 32:34.039
Rios is safe.

32:37.042 --> 32:41.046
20-David to D-Team.
I've got eyes on Saint.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.919
Stop right there, Saint!

32:46.399 --> 32:47.574
Drop the weapon!

32:47.574 --> 32:49.054
Don't move.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.925
Looks like my back
is against the wall.

32:50.925 --> 32:52.535
There's nowhere to go.

32:52.535 --> 32:54.059
It's over.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.322
Appears to be.

32:56.322 --> 32:59.934
You put that weapon down,
you can still walk out of here.

32:59.934 --> 33:01.762
And what?

33:01.762 --> 33:04.765
Spend the rest of my life
in prison?

33:04.765 --> 33:06.506
You don't need
to die today, Saint.

33:07.855 --> 33:11.206
We all punch the clock
someday, Hondo.

33:11.206 --> 33:16.255
Better on my own terms, while
I have the people's hearts.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.083
Once they know what you've done,
that all goes away.

33:18.083 --> 33:24.350
My legacy will speak louder than
your accusations, I assure you.

33:24.350 --> 33:25.612
Shoot me,

33:25.612 --> 33:29.094
and I'll remain a hero, and you

33:29.094 --> 33:32.488
will be known
as the man who killed a saint.

33:37.363 --> 33:38.886
20-David to Command.
Saint is down.

33:38.886 --> 33:42.020
We need an R/A to location.

33:44.674 --> 33:46.154
You ain't no saint.

33:46.154 --> 33:48.548
I told you it was just
gonna take one mistake.

33:48.548 --> 33:50.767
You are not dying a martyr.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.786
Hey, Powell.

34:09.786 --> 34:11.310
I thought I was
clear before.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.573
We don't have to do
the whole check-in thing.

34:13.573 --> 34:16.489
You were right.
You don't need me hovering.

34:16.489 --> 34:18.056
I just wanted to help, you know,

34:18.056 --> 34:20.188
and I see a lot
of myself in you.

34:20.188 --> 34:23.278
I'm not like you.

34:23.278 --> 34:26.847
And as a woman,

34:26.847 --> 34:29.415
I don't want people thinking
that I need extra help

34:29.415 --> 34:31.373
to keep up, you understand?

34:31.373 --> 34:33.375
Yeah, I do.

34:33.375 --> 34:36.857
I just... I...

34:36.857 --> 34:39.033
I had a lot of trouble
fitting in

34:39.033 --> 34:40.904
when I first got here,
too, and I think

34:40.904 --> 34:43.690
I was trying to be the person
that I needed back then,

34:43.690 --> 34:45.213
not the person
that you need now.

34:45.213 --> 34:46.780
What does that mean?

34:46.780 --> 34:48.347
What kind of person
do I need now?

34:48.347 --> 34:50.523
I don't know.

34:50.523 --> 34:52.786
But I'd like to find out.

34:52.786 --> 34:55.093
Look, um,

34:55.093 --> 34:56.790
there's few of us, we're hanging
at my place tonight.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.139
You should come.

34:58.139 --> 35:00.750
Get to know the team
a little better.

35:01.490 --> 35:04.145
Sure. Sounds fun.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.929
Cool.

35:19.378 --> 35:20.988
Gracias.

35:24.383 --> 35:26.820
- There he is.
- RIOS [laughing]:
Hey.

35:28.213 --> 35:30.171
Maria,

35:30.171 --> 35:31.999
I am so sorry.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.654
You brought him back to me.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.440
Thank you.

35:39.398 --> 35:42.009
I'll give you two
some space.

35:50.452 --> 35:51.932
How you holding up?

35:51.932 --> 35:53.455
Better and better.

35:53.455 --> 35:56.937
I spoke to Cyber.
The flash drive key worked.

35:56.937 --> 35:58.243
Man, that was
quick thinking,

35:58.243 --> 35:59.896
you sticking that thing
in the headrest.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.246
Ah, heat of the moment, man.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.248
I saw the hole and reacted.
Glad it worked out.

36:03.248 --> 36:05.946
When Cyber unlocked the
encrypted laptop, they found

36:05.946 --> 36:08.122
smuggling routes,
illegal transaction records,

36:08.122 --> 36:10.385
everything we need
- to put Saint away for life.
- Yeah.

36:10.385 --> 36:13.127
And we're doing everything
we can for your son Charlie.

36:13.127 --> 36:16.783
Hicks thinks, at worst, he's
looking at admin probation.

36:16.783 --> 36:18.567
Music to my ears.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.961
Seriously, Rios.

36:20.961 --> 36:23.224
I'm sorry how
things went down.

36:23.224 --> 36:25.618
I should have never pushed you
into going after Saint.

36:25.618 --> 36:27.228
I almost got you killed.

36:27.228 --> 36:30.449
I didn't take up the shield
just to collect a pension.

36:30.449 --> 36:32.929
We did good.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.802
But, yeah,
next time you need a favor,

36:35.802 --> 36:37.847
call somebody else, huh?

36:39.632 --> 36:42.765
That's fair.

36:43.549 --> 36:45.812
That's...

36:45.812 --> 36:48.467
Ah, come on.

36:48.467 --> 36:50.164
You're kidding me.

36:50.164 --> 36:52.819
- Commander? Can I come in?
- Yeah.

36:52.819 --> 36:55.082
What's up?

36:56.344 --> 36:58.172
Look, you can come clean, Commander.

36:58.172 --> 37:01.088
You shouldn't be going through
this without some support.

37:01.088 --> 37:02.698
Going through what?

37:02.698 --> 37:04.483
Look, Tan and I heard you
on the phone with your doctor

37:04.483 --> 37:06.311
this morning. We know
something's going on.

37:06.311 --> 37:10.097
If there's anything
we can do...

37:10.880 --> 37:12.142
Oh.

37:12.142 --> 37:15.015
Oh, Luca, I'm not sick.

37:15.015 --> 37:17.670
I was talking
to Luiza Coles

37:17.670 --> 37:20.412
She's...

37:20.412 --> 37:22.457
She's a matchmaker.

37:22.457 --> 37:24.329
But you called her "Doc."

37:24.329 --> 37:26.200
Well, he's got a PhD
in sociology.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.897
Everybody calls her "Doc."Okay.

37:27.897 --> 37:30.465
So, the exercise bike
- and the diet change?
- Luca, I haven't

37:30.465 --> 37:33.076
been on a date in 30 years,
so I just want to, you know,

37:33.076 --> 37:35.122
- put my best foot forward.
- So you're not sick?

37:35.122 --> 37:36.384
No, no, no, far from it.

37:36.384 --> 37:38.386
If I felt any better,
I'd be two people. Oh.

37:38.386 --> 37:39.605
Hey, oh.

37:39.605 --> 37:41.868
Luca, Luca, that's
enough, that's enough.

37:41.868 --> 37:44.174
Wow. You... That was...

37:44.174 --> 37:46.264
I'm fine, all right?

37:46.264 --> 37:48.962
I still think
you might need my help, though.

37:48.962 --> 37:51.486
Dating's changed
a little bit in 30 years.

37:52.966 --> 37:55.708
Unbutton the top button-- this
is a date, not a job interview.

37:57.187 --> 37:59.059
You remember
I'm still your boss, right?

37:59.059 --> 38:01.714
All right. This is not
a job interview, sir.

38:01.714 --> 38:04.282
How much time
do we have?

38:04.282 --> 38:05.631
I'm meeting her
for drinks in an hour.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.415
Oh, my God, okay.
Well, it's not a lot of time,

38:07.415 --> 38:09.112
but it's enough
to run you through the basics.

38:09.112 --> 38:10.418
This what you're gonna wear?

38:10.418 --> 38:12.551
- It's casual.
- Do you have anything else?

38:12.551 --> 38:14.814
You wear the same thing
- every day, man.
- Yeah, well...

38:14.814 --> 38:17.207
Just roll the sleeves up.
- That should be good.
- Oh, all right.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.647
Nichelle.

38:21.647 --> 38:23.301
Hey.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.477
- Hey, beautiful.
- Mwaw.

38:25.477 --> 38:27.087
I figured I'd try one
of your mom's recipes

38:27.087 --> 38:28.567
to celebrate your big win.

38:28.567 --> 38:32.310
I have been saving
this congratulations all day.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.921
You've finally put Saint
where he belongs.

38:34.921 --> 38:38.490
Baby, people are already
calling his arrest...

38:38.490 --> 38:41.536
a political hit job.

38:41.536 --> 38:44.974
Oh, they'll come around,
but first they need to mourn.

38:44.974 --> 38:46.976
You have to remember

38:46.976 --> 38:48.761
the man ran charities
and a soup kitchen.

38:48.761 --> 38:53.156
Saint meant something good to
just as many people as he hurt.

38:55.289 --> 38:57.073
Maybe...

38:57.073 --> 38:59.554
you just need a little reminder.

38:59.554 --> 39:02.209
Oh, yeah?

39:02.209 --> 39:04.385
Of what?

39:04.385 --> 39:06.953
That no matter what people say,

39:06.953 --> 39:10.086
what you did today,
what you do every day

39:10.086 --> 39:13.176
makes the world safer
for everyone in it.

39:13.176 --> 39:16.658
And everyone to come.

39:19.835 --> 39:22.055
You're right.
