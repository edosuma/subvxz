to save my city.</i>

00:31.323 --> 00:32.404
He's my old partner.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.611
We have to find him
before he hurts anyone else.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.943
The police are coming. You should go.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.529
Will you marry me?

00:39.998 --> 00:40.988
Yeah.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.824
You're the very best part of me.

00:43.085 --> 00:46.078
I'm a better human being
just because I've loved you.

01:00.769 --> 01:01.759
There he is. Hey, buddy.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.678
Aunt Thea said
I could have some champagne.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.513
I said a sip,

01:05.607 --> 01:07.564
and only during the toast.

01:07.651 --> 01:10.189
Mom and Dad used to let us do that.
That's just fine.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.023
Yeah, and we turned out all right.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.240
I think that they would be
pretty impressed with this party,

01:15.325 --> 01:16.657
and the groom.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.072
- Think so?
- Yeah. Of course.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.446
Why, is everything okay?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.907
Felicity was supposed to be here
by now, so...

01:24.251 --> 01:26.334
What's there
to be nervous about, Ollie?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.912
You guys are already married,

01:29.423 --> 01:32.086
and it's not like you invited
anyone but John to the ceremony.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.632
Well, uh,
you were still in the hospital,

01:33.719 --> 01:35.335
and it was
just a little last minute, okay?

01:35.429 --> 01:37.045
- Yeah, I know. I know.

01:37.556 --> 01:38.546
Hey.

Lyla apologizes
for not being able to make it.

01:40.851 --> 01:42.308

do not stop for weddings.

01:42.394 --> 01:45.637
Well, she was hoping that
it would for this.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.221
Congrats, man.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.437
- So where is the bride?
- I don't know.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.693
Donna said that
she had a plan, but...

02:16.053 --> 02:18.511
Mom insisted
that we make an entrance

02:18.597 --> 02:19.758
since we didn't have
a traditional wedding,

02:19.848 --> 02:21.134
which I'm sure
I'll never stop hearing about

02:21.224 --> 02:22.340
for the rest of my life.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.300
- DONNA: Welcome to the family...
- Oh.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.181
Son.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.478
(HIGH-PITCHED GIGGLE)

02:27.564 --> 02:29.851
- I can call you that now, right?
- Sure.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.273
- Yeah.
- Great.

02:31.693 --> 02:32.683
I want you to know

02:33.445 --> 02:35.653
that I have forgiven both of you
for running off

02:36.031 --> 02:37.021
and eloping.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.653
And for waiting to
propose to my daughter

02:39.743 --> 02:41.029
until you were under indictment.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.985
Oh, actually, Felicity proposed to me.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.616
Come on, Donna,
let's let them have their day.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.447
They did have their day,
and we weren't part of it, remember?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.367
I guess she's keeping
the tradition of the Smoak women

02:49.920 --> 02:51.536
not having traditional weddings.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.292
What are you talking about?
We had a wedding.

02:53.382 --> 02:56.045
No. Getting married by
a Tom Jones-impersonating rabbi

02:56.134 --> 02:57.124
isn't exactly traditional.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.086
- You love Tom Jones.
- No, I don't. You love Tom Jones.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.921
You know what?
At least we had a Jewish wedding.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.598
Seriously, you guys, would it
have killed you to get a rabbi?

03:04.935 --> 03:05.925
Or a chuppa?

03:06.770 --> 03:08.181
I'm gonna steal Felicity
for a moment.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.103
- Oh, yes, of course.
- I'll bring her back.

are already your in-laws.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.813
So, if you're having second thoughts,
it's too late for you.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.485
I wouldn't have it any other way.

- She did. (CHUCKLES)

Even when I saw on the news
that your engagement was off,

- You did.
- I did.

you guys could make it.

to move back to Ivy Town,</i>

would make that kinda tough, right?

04:04.536 --> 04:05.947
We love Ivy town, but...

04:06.747 --> 04:07.737
Star City is our home.

spending the rest of your life

04:47.037 --> 04:48.494
with one person seems

04:48.580 --> 04:51.448
pretty unrealistic, and, uh,
also pretty boring.

04:51.541 --> 04:52.577
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

- What?

I was never the girl who dreamed
about her wedding,

10:36.136 --> 10:38.799
but I have to say
this was the perfect evening.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.174
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.553
Uh... I'm so sorry. We got a problem.

10:44.769 --> 10:45.976
I think I jinxed it.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.769
- (OLIVER SIGHS)
- Come on.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.103
(OLIVER CLEARS THROAT)

10:49.858 --> 10:50.894
- What's going on?
- Well, listen,

10:50.984 --> 10:52.646
I really did not want to
do this right now.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.067
But Jean Loring just called

10:54.154 --> 10:55.736
and she said
I got to tell you right away.

10:55.905 --> 10:56.895
It's okay. What's happening?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.447
I told her you were in the middle of
celebrating your wedding...

10:58.616 --> 11:00.778
Quentin, what's going on?

11:04.831 --> 11:06.914
The prosecution's smoking gun

11:07.709 --> 11:11.453
is a witness who is willing to
testify that you are the Green Arrow.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.872
- Who?
- That information's still under seal.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.498
But it's someone on the team.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.399
I can't believe
this is happening again.

11:34.485 --> 11:35.771
Okay, hold on a second.
We do not know

11:35.862 --> 11:37.649
this is an
Evelyn Sharp situation yet.

11:37.739 --> 11:38.729
It's a betrayal.

11:40.658 --> 11:41.774
I never should've trusted them.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.530
It's not a "them," it's a "one."

11:43.870 --> 11:46.237
A one who wants to out you to the FBI
that will lock you away for life.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.993
That's an awfully long time.
I'd wait for you.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.540
JOHN: <i>Hey, I just got your message.</i>

11:51.002 --> 11:52.368
Usually, the bride and groom
like to be alone

11:52.462 --> 11:53.543
on their wedding night, what's up?

11:53.796 --> 11:55.662
Somebody on the team gave me up
to Samanda Watson.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.293
That's impossible, Oliver.
No one would do that.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.373
Lance got it from Jean Loring.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.880
Jean Loring got it
from District Attorney Armand.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.964
I'm running surveillance on
Curtis, Dinah and Rene

12:05.058 --> 12:06.765
and I have worms crawling through
their texts and e-mails.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.514
- So you're spying on them?
- I'm not spying on them.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.687
More like keeping tabs.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.227
Oliver, why not just
confront whoever this is

12:14.317 --> 12:15.524
and give them a chance to come clean?

12:15.693 --> 12:17.309
What makes you think
they're gonna be forthcoming?

12:17.737 --> 12:21.822
How do we know that this isn't
just the surface of this betrayal?

12:21.908 --> 12:23.820
I mean, look, John,
I don't want to spy on them.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.742
If you have a better idea...

12:26.621 --> 12:27.611
I'm all for it.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.454
If someone goes somewhere suspicious,
we'll know.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.372
Felicity, we were all
just at the wedding.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.920
The most suspicious place they can go
is out for late-night pizza.

12:37.006 --> 12:40.249
John, either Curtis, Dinah,
or Rene gave me up.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.634
We need to know why,
we need to know who.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.425
Otherwise, when you
put the hood back on,

12:46.683 --> 12:47.673
you could be next.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.148
All right, all right.
Where do you want to go,

12:57.235 --> 12:58.225
bathroom or couch?

12:58.319 --> 13:01.187

13:05.535 --> 13:06.901
That was not because I was drunk.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.160
That is just because
I am very clumsy.

13:09.414 --> 13:12.907
Wow! This is the doghouse.
Woof! (CHUCKLES)

13:13.084 --> 13:14.871
It's actually way cleaner
than I thought it would be.

13:16.546 --> 13:19.254
Oh, look, you have flowers.
Why do you have flowers?

13:19.340 --> 13:22.174
Are you seeing some lady friend
or something?

13:22.385 --> 13:23.375
It's not like that.

13:24.095 --> 13:25.506
You know who I'm going to see

13:25.596 --> 13:27.337
when I get to my place
in the morning?

13:27.432 --> 13:28.513
Some hot dude?

13:29.017 --> 13:30.007
Myself.

13:30.685 --> 13:31.675
In the mirror.

13:32.603 --> 13:33.593
Alone.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.101
<i>Do you think
it was the vigilantism</i>

13:36.774 --> 13:37.764
that drove Paul away?

or did...

Only all the time.

13:55.752 --> 13:56.742
<i>You know what, though?</i>

13:57.962 --> 14:00.625
Oliver and Felicity
got their happy ending.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.753
Which is all that matters.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.335
To Oliver, at least.

14:06.429 --> 14:09.297
That's just the booze talking, hoss.
All right?

14:09.390 --> 14:10.926
I mean, you're gonna find
someone new,

14:35.833 --> 14:37.699
You have to stop contacting me.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.623
I've done all
I'm willing to do for you.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.668
I'm not here to ask for a favor.

14:47.637 --> 14:48.627
Then what do you want?

14:48.930 --> 14:50.046
I miss you, D.

14:51.766 --> 14:52.756
That dress

14:53.518 --> 14:55.680
reminds of the one you wore
from the Guzman op.

14:55.770 --> 14:59.434
Don't do that.
Don't try to dip me in nostalgia.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.808
I don't even know
who you are anymore, Vince.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.069
The man I knew would never,

15:06.572 --> 15:08.814
could never kill an innocent person.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.822
The people I've killed
weren't innocent.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.027
Oh, no?

15:14.372 --> 15:17.080
Well, what about that cop
you accidentally shot last month?

15:17.166 --> 15:19.032
- Collateral damage.
- (SCOFFS) What?

15:19.293 --> 15:20.329
Are you trying to tell me

15:20.420 --> 15:23.834
that there hasn't been any in the war
that Green Arrow's fighting?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.880
No. No, there hasn't.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.258
Sounds like I'm not the only one
who's changed.

15:28.970 --> 15:31.428
The Dinah Drake I knew
was never this naive.

15:31.514 --> 15:35.679
Oliver brought me back
from a very dark, very bad place.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.394
He stopped me from becoming you.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.563
The only difference
between him and me

15:41.649 --> 15:43.811
is that I don't lie to myself
about what I'm doing.

Look,

15:48.072 --> 15:49.608
I may not be a saint,

And if I catch you
out in the field again,

16:12.430 --> 16:14.217
I won't let you get away
a second time.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.510
You didn't have to walk me
all the way home, Quentin.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.596
You know I can take care of myself.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.976
You are still recovering from
six months in a coma, Thea.

a little overprotective here.

back into a coma.

17:08.736 --> 17:09.852
Could we get audio on this?

17:09.945 --> 17:12.483
No, I tracked her to this location,
then accessed street cams.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.278
Guess we know how Vigilante
skipped the cops last month.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.075
JOHN: There's no way we can tell
what she's saying to him.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.151
OLIVER: It doesn't matter
what she's saying to him.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.532
- She lied to the team about this.
- JOHN: Oliver...

17:20.623 --> 17:21.829
What else has she lied about?

17:21.915 --> 17:23.123
Let's not get paranoid here.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.874
Well, it's not paranoia
if it's a legitimate fear.

17:24.961 --> 17:26.623
I mean, Vigilante
tried to kill Oliver last year,

17:26.712 --> 17:27.919
he wants to out them
to law enforcement,

17:28.005 --> 17:30.213
he's virtually doing the same thing.
It puts him away for life.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.790
Okay. I don't think
Dinah would do this,

17:31.884 --> 17:33.466
she cares way too much
about this team.

17:33.553 --> 17:34.669
Oliver, listen,

17:35.638 --> 17:37.470
she supported me through my injury.

17:38.432 --> 17:41.596
- And as the Green Arrow...
- I know and I appreciate that.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.143
But after what happened with Evelyn,

17:44.689 --> 17:46.146
we need to protect ourselves.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.474
Thea, are you okay?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.356
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's okay.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.228
What happened?

Not that I'm not glad
that you're okay,

but it's not like Evil Laurel
to leave loose ends.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.123
She needed a messenger.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.693
I'm sure you can research it.

that it's secured at A.R.G.U.S.

you vowed to destroy the city.

18:44.707 --> 18:45.697
I'm guessing this amplifier

18:45.791 --> 18:47.783
gets you one step closer
to completing that goal.

18:48.628 --> 18:49.744
So why should I help you?

18:50.046 --> 18:53.380

Mr. Lance dying, didn't I?

a replica of this thing,

19:22.286 --> 19:23.993

19:24.080 --> 19:25.366
No. I mean, we're good,

He knows it's at A.R.G.U.S.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.076
Why doesn't he just
hack in there himself?

A.R.G.U.S. is 100% air-gapped.

I mean, you can't access
their network unless you're on site.

cross paths with A.R.G.U.S.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.647
I'll shut down security
when I access

20:42.742 --> 20:43.732
the panel, does everybody copy?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.030
- (BEEPS)
- In position.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.445
Still don't understand
why the brown guy's

20:48.539 --> 20:49.871
gotta be the janitor, is all.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.660
Janitor is
a very honorable profession.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.831
They clean up after you puke, which
is something I might do very soon.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.286
Why the hell isn't Dinah here?

20:56.505 --> 20:58.417
Is it possible that she could be
more hungover than I am?

20:58.632 --> 21:00.589
<i>- Definitely not.</i>
- GREEN ARROW: <i>Guys, focus!</i>

21:07.558 --> 21:09.641
Overwatch, I'm in position.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.635
How long until security is down?

21:11.729 --> 21:12.936
That depends on Curtis.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.769
(BREATHING HEAVILY) We're clear.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.233
(EXHALES) Also, leaning over,
not a great decision.

21:19.945 --> 21:20.935
You're not throwing up.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.487
I'm already spending my honeymoon
in a garbage can,

21:22.573 --> 21:23.734
I'm not wearing your puke.

21:23.949 --> 21:24.939
- She slapped me.
- FELICITY: <i>Oliver,</i>

21:25.367 --> 21:26.483
I can only buy you 60 seconds

21:26.577 --> 21:28.944
before the security
around the amplifier turns back on.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.328
That's more than enough time for me.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.950
FELICITY: <i>The floor's
still pressure sensitive,</i>

21:32.041 --> 21:33.907
<i>if you touch it,
it will re-trigger the alarm.</i>

21:34.001 --> 21:35.617
Copy that. On your count.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.621
Three, two, one. Go.

21:39.799 --> 21:40.789
Almost there.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.893
Guys, you're about to get company.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.136
We need more time.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.732
Oh! (SIGHS)

22:00.903 --> 22:01.893
I got it.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.447
Clear. In three, two, one.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.199
How you guys doing?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.708
Good news is
this is exactly what Cayden wanted.

22:24.927 --> 22:27.385
- Bad news is...
- It's exactly what Cayden wanted.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.012
- Yeah.
- At least now we know

22:29.098 --> 22:30.384
what he's gonna use it for.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.386
What, he didn't want to
supercharge his Christmas lights?

22:33.143 --> 22:35.055
Remember the thermobaric bomb
that Cayden stole?

22:35.145 --> 22:38.479
Well, this will multiply
the blast radius 20-fold easily.

22:38.566 --> 22:39.773
That's the entire city and then some.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.816
Look, I wanna save Lance
as much as anyone,

22:41.986 --> 22:43.102
but he wouldn't want this.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.528
I mean, he wouldn't want us to
just hand over something so dangerous

22:45.614 --> 22:46.604
to some psycho.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.440
Yeah. Well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

22:49.410 --> 22:50.526
Curtis is gonna sabotage.

22:50.786 --> 22:51.776
Curtis is gonna do what, now?

22:51.871 --> 22:53.828
The amplifier doesn't have to work.
We just need Cayden James

22:53.914 --> 22:55.871
to think that it works long enough
for us to get Quentin back.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.665
I could back-channel a path
into the circuitry.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.083
If you hide it
behind the existing border,

22:59.169 --> 23:01.126
it might buy us enough time to
get Lance, get the hell out of there.

23:03.257 --> 23:04.247
Hi.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.084
Did you guys
just get back from the field?

23:09.305 --> 23:10.295
Why didn't I get a call?

23:12.516 --> 23:13.677
We should speak in private.

23:13.767 --> 23:15.303
That's a bit dramatic, don't you think?

23:15.936 --> 23:17.723
Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)

23:18.814 --> 23:21.022
I know that you've been
meeting with the Vigilante in secret.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.355
- You followed me?
- I did.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.278
Whatever business I have with Vince
is none of yours.

23:30.367 --> 23:31.824
It is when it threatens to
put me in prison

23:31.911 --> 23:33.152
and keep me away from my son.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.445
What the hell are you talking about?

23:34.538 --> 23:37.372
We're talking about being arrested
off the statement of someone

23:37.583 --> 23:38.699
who knows my identity.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.372
Somebody on this team!

23:41.462 --> 23:42.873
And you think it was me?

23:42.963 --> 23:44.704
What, because I didn't tell you
about Vince?

23:44.798 --> 23:47.836
I think you have given me
no reason to trust you.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.126
(DINAH SCOFFS)

23:53.474 --> 23:54.464
And you, what about you?

23:55.851 --> 23:57.092
You don't trust me either, John?

23:59.521 --> 24:00.511
Dinah, I'm sorry.

24:02.608 --> 24:03.598
Wow.

24:04.693 --> 24:08.983
No. No, no. Hey, I'm the sorry one,
you know.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.615
I'm the sorry one
for having your back all those times.

24:15.329 --> 24:16.865
- Screw you guys.
- I'm not finished.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.323
- I am.
- Hey, guys... (EXHALES)

24:19.458 --> 24:21.165
Can we all just please calm down
for a second?

24:21.669 --> 24:22.830
<i>Look, I know everyone's stressed</i>

24:22.920 --> 24:25.207
<i>because Cayden's threatening to
blow up the city,</i>

24:25.756 --> 24:26.963
and Lance is kidnapped,

24:27.841 --> 24:29.173
but let's just all
just take a breath.

24:29.426 --> 24:30.962
Now I'm not saying that it's me,

24:31.178 --> 24:33.044
but it can literally be
any one of us.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.513
Dinah, you are the only one
who has something to hide.

24:36.684 --> 24:37.765
Everyone else checked out.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.969
- What does that mean?
- DINAH DRAKE: <i>Yeah,</i>

24:41.313 --> 24:42.474
what does that mean, John?

24:43.232 --> 24:44.814
It means we had you
under surveillance.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.109
- All of us?
- Yeah.

24:48.195 --> 24:51.654
And by "all of us" you mean
all of us.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.190
So, just the newbies.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.281
We're out there risking our lives
just like the rest of you are...

24:57.371 --> 24:58.361
Stop.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.618
Dinah isn't the witness, Oliver.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.704
- You don't know that.
<i>- Yes, I do.</i>

25:05.254 --> 25:06.244
Because it's me.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.755
I'm the one
who's testifying against you.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.009
Agent Watson came to me.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.680
She said she had proof
that I was Wild Dog,

25:20.769 --> 25:21.976
and that she was gonna
use it against me

25:22.062 --> 25:24.395
to make sure
that I never saw Zoe again.

25:24.898 --> 25:27.481
<i>She said she had a solid case
against you,</i>

25:28.318 --> 25:30.526
and that she was gonna arrest you
either way.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.729
<i>You were going down.</i>

25:33.449 --> 25:35.156
I just couldn't make
the trip with you.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.984
You should have told us, Rene.
We could have figured something out.

25:38.078 --> 25:40.035
There was
nothing to figure out, hoss,

25:40.664 --> 25:43.247
right? There is no other way.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.744
And now we'll never know.

25:45.794 --> 25:46.784
OLIVER: <i>Rene...</i>

25:48.338 --> 25:49.328
Get out.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.635
Get out.

26:05.898 --> 26:06.979
(QUENTIN GROANS)

26:07.066 --> 26:09.433
Oh, good. You're awake.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.945
I wanted us to
have a little daddy-daughter time.

26:14.448 --> 26:16.189
Because of what happened on Lian Yu?

26:16.283 --> 26:18.115
You make it sound like
I should be over it by now.

26:19.203 --> 26:21.240
You shot me and left me for dead.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.279
You seem to have bounced back.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.114
Yeah, thanks to Cayden James.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.417
He sent someone for me.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.832
I'm sorry, I made a mistake
shooting you.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.001
<i>- I'm glad you're okay.</i>
- (CHUCKLES)

26:32.174 --> 26:34.757
- Then you're an idiot.
- (CHUCKLES) You're probably right.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.468
(SIGHING) You're probably right.

26:39.139 --> 26:40.129
Listen,

26:40.432 --> 26:42.719
when you, uh, look at me,

26:43.936 --> 26:45.768
do see your own father

26:47.064 --> 26:48.054
at all?

26:48.649 --> 26:49.639
No.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.943
Because my father died
when I was 13.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.570
What happened?

26:56.115 --> 26:57.697
It was my 13th birthday.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.824
And he left
to go get my birthday cake

27:00.911 --> 27:01.947
like he did every year.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.032
And then the phone rang.

27:06.208 --> 27:09.576
There was an accident. A drunk driver
ran through a red light.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.453
Head-on collision.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.622
I'm sorry.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.671
<i>I used to pick up Laurel's cake, too.</i>

27:18.262 --> 27:20.174
Yellow with chocolate frosting.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.593
From her favorite bakery.

27:25.227 --> 27:26.217
Carly's.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.224
<i>I'm sorry you didn't get to
know your father.</i>

27:30.107 --> 27:31.598
I guess you're stuck knowing me.

27:32.401 --> 27:33.733
(DOOR OPENS)

27:33.819 --> 27:34.809
CAYDEN: <i>Okay, it's time.</i>

27:38.115 --> 27:41.074
Remember, if Green Arrow
reneges on our deal, you kill him.

27:50.586 --> 27:51.576
How can you eat this?

27:51.670 --> 27:53.002
You ask me that every time.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.041
He means at a time like this.

27:55.257 --> 27:56.668
Stress makes me hungry.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.792
So does guilt.

28:00.429 --> 28:01.419
I just...

28:02.556 --> 28:03.546
I screwed up,

28:04.766 --> 28:07.429
you know, Oliver was right
to kick me off the team.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.310
(SIGHS) You were in
an impossible position.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.262
RENE: Yeah, and when you're in
an impossible position

28:11.982 --> 28:13.848
that's why there's a team, D.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.475
Just like Dig said.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.818
You're uncharacteristically
quiet, hoss.

28:22.492 --> 28:23.482
I'm just hungover.

28:23.869 --> 28:27.579
Doing some processing. I'm actually
doing a lot of processing.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.531
Oliver spying on us, you mean.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.286
I'm not gonna pretend
there's not a difference between

28:31.376 --> 28:33.208
the three of us
and the three of them,

28:33.295 --> 28:34.661
the original three, but...

28:34.755 --> 28:37.668
Spying on us? I mean, come on.
That crosses a line.

28:37.841 --> 28:41.425
Yeah. And I just don't like the way
that it makes me feel.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.088
Now I'm stressed.

28:51.188 --> 28:52.178
Wow.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.893
It's good. It's real good.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.024
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.694
Felicity told me what happened.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.237
Yeah.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.702
I would ask if you're okay, but I

29:12.209 --> 29:13.871
think I already know the answer.

29:15.671 --> 29:17.037
Thinking about what Rene did.

29:19.174 --> 29:20.915
What do you do, really?

29:21.593 --> 29:23.175
He kept a secret,

29:23.553 --> 29:25.590
and he put his daughter
ahead of the team.

29:28.225 --> 29:29.341
And I feel betrayed.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.509
How can I feel betrayed

29:33.063 --> 29:35.897
by somebody doing
the exact same things that I've done?

29:36.608 --> 29:39.976
Because you've never
sold anyone out on the team, Ollie.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.941
And if you're convicted,

29:44.157 --> 29:45.648
you could end up spending a really

29:46.201 --> 29:47.988
long time in jail.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.487
But having said that,

29:53.208 --> 29:55.495
you're doing
the right thing looking

29:56.253 --> 29:58.040
at things through his perspective.

29:58.880 --> 29:59.870
And having done that...

30:00.924 --> 30:03.211
(SIGHS) Maybe you can see
your way to forgiving him.

30:04.469 --> 30:05.459
Seriously?

30:05.762 --> 30:07.378
Well, Rene is a...

30:08.682 --> 30:11.550
A very desperate guy
who just did a

30:12.144 --> 30:13.680
very desperate thing.

30:14.271 --> 30:17.309
But he's also the same guy
who, just last night,

30:17.399 --> 30:20.813
was giving such
a heartfelt sweet speech,

30:21.695 --> 30:22.685
and calling you his friend.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.486
And I really think
that he meant that.

30:25.449 --> 30:28.317
It was a betrayal, no question.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.443
But since you've been able to
see things

30:30.537 --> 30:32.119
from his point of view,

30:33.457 --> 30:35.574
you should also be able to
see your way to forgiving him.

30:37.919 --> 30:38.909
Listen to you.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.797
<i>Quentin needs the team
right now, Ollie.</i>

30:43.717 --> 30:45.083
But he needs the whole one.

30:48.305 --> 30:49.295
It's almost nightfall.

30:51.141 --> 30:52.131
Let's have the team suit up.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.258
<i>John...</i>

30:56.063 --> 30:58.350
- The whole team.
- Copy that.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.321
WILD DOG:
Thanks for having me back, man.

31:11.661 --> 31:13.152
- Let's get our friend back.
- (BEEPS)

31:13.288 --> 31:14.904
This is where Cayden James wants to
make the exchange?

31:14.998 --> 31:16.705
Yeah, it's a no-brainer
he picked this place.

31:16.792 --> 31:19.455
It's a digital black hole.
There's no cameras, insulated walls.

31:19.753 --> 31:21.540
Once you guys get inside,
I'm totally blind.

31:21.713 --> 31:22.920
Well, that means so is he.

31:23.006 --> 31:25.089
- Did you get the amplifier working?
- I hope so,

31:25.175 --> 31:26.916
'cause otherwise we'd be
handing a crazy psychopath

31:27.010 --> 31:28.592
the means to crater the entire city.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.470
I mean, yes. Yes, it's ready.

31:31.932 --> 31:33.924
I'll handle the exchange.
You three will be my eyes and ears.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.974
The priority is extracting Quentin,

31:36.061 --> 31:38.018
<i>but if we get a chance
to take Cayden James into custody,</i>

31:38.105 --> 31:39.095
<i>we take it.</i>

31:39.439 --> 31:41.931
Whatever we're going through,
whatever issues we have,

31:42.025 --> 31:44.187
let's put it aside
and get the job done.

31:44.945 --> 31:46.436
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

31:47.197 --> 31:48.358
Agreed.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.314
Okay. Let's go.

31:58.375 --> 31:59.365
So we meet again.

32:00.001 --> 32:00.991
Where's Lance?

32:01.169 --> 32:03.286
Oh. Somewhere handy.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.505
I'll be taking that amplifier now.

32:06.591 --> 32:10.460
You will be telling me
where Lance is.

32:11.596 --> 32:12.586
A fair request.

32:13.974 --> 32:16.762
Equally fair, lay down your bow.

32:17.727 --> 32:18.843
I'll let you speak with him.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.564
I am a man of my word.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.934
If I wasn't, there wouldn't be
much point in

32:26.027 --> 32:27.643
vowing to destroy this city.

32:28.488 --> 32:29.478
Would there?

32:33.368 --> 32:34.575
No sign of Lance or Laurel.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.369
We can't see anything from up here.

32:37.873 --> 32:38.863
Let's search the building.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.495
Green Arrow said stay put
until he makes the exchange.

32:41.668 --> 32:44.502
What, we're his eyes and ears
and we can't even look around?

32:44.588 --> 32:45.874
FELICITY: <i>Guys, we need you as backup.</i>

32:45.964 --> 32:47.830
Well, maybe if you'd bugged Lance
like you bugged us,

32:47.924 --> 32:48.914
we'd know where he was.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.251
Whoa! We didn't bug you guys.
We tracked your GPS.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.425
It's totally different.

32:52.512 --> 32:53.878
- (BEEPS)
- You're bugging me now.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.762
<i>You know I can hear you
through Wild Dog's comms,</i>

32:55.849 --> 32:57.761
<i>- you know that, right?</i>
- (BEEPS)

32:57.851 --> 32:58.887
WILD DOG: Screw it.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.718
I'm not gonna sit around here
and wait for Oliver to

33:00.812 --> 33:01.973
decide to trust us again.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.535
See? Wasn't that easy?

33:24.461 --> 33:25.451
- (BEEPS)
- Are you all right?

33:25.545 --> 33:27.878
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
Accommodations could be nicer.

33:27.964 --> 33:28.954
But yeah, I'm fine.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.749
Yeah, well, sit tight.
I'll be there soon.

33:32.052 --> 33:34.715
Yeah, just don't compromise
the city's safety for me, all right?

33:35.472 --> 33:37.509
Now there's
a dedicated civil servant.

33:37.599 --> 33:39.010
I wish there were more like him.

33:39.684 --> 33:41.346
Proof of life, as requested.

33:41.895 --> 33:43.386
Your turn now, I think.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.347
Take what you wanted.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.103
Mmm.

33:49.694 --> 33:50.684
I think not.

33:51.279 --> 33:54.568
<i>You see, what I wanted was
a nano aluminum amplifier.</i>

33:55.367 --> 33:57.609
One that hasn't been sabotaged.

33:59.579 --> 34:00.569
He knows.

34:00.914 --> 34:02.246
That makes no sense.
How could he know?

34:02.916 --> 34:03.906
I'm disappointed.

34:04.751 --> 34:08.335
Though not nearly as much, I imagine,
as your friend Mr. Lance.

34:09.089 --> 34:10.079
Kill him.

34:11.132 --> 34:12.121
And kill him.

34:17.304 --> 34:18.545
(ALL GRUNTING)

34:27.274 --> 34:28.514
Team, everything's gone south.

34:28.608 --> 34:29.688
Back up Green Arrow.

34:30.110 --> 34:31.726

34:44.958 --> 34:46.449
Wild Dog, Terrific,
where are you guys?

34:46.543 --> 34:48.125
- We're on our way.
- On your way?

34:48.210 --> 34:49.201
Why weren't you in position?

34:49.379 --> 34:50.835
Don't got time for that now, hoss!

34:55.844 --> 34:57.130
We got eyes on Lance.

His men are down.

35:17.490 --> 35:18.856
Where the hell is everybody?

35:19.159 --> 35:20.149
I've got Lance and Laurel.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.404
<i>They're exiting
the north side of the building.</i>

35:21.494 --> 35:22.484
I'm on my way.

35:23.288 --> 35:24.495
WILD DOG:
Laurel's getting away with Lance.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.197
We've got company.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.121

36:09.793 --> 36:10.783
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

36:11.753 --> 36:12.914
Thanks for coming to get me.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.967
Yeah. We're good here.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.898
- How's Lance?
- He's fine. Sleeping it off.

36:35.652 --> 36:37.359
Any sign of Cayden James
or Black Siren?

36:37.612 --> 36:39.228
<i>Nada</i>. They're completely
off the grid.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.692
But we got Quentin back.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.690
- That was the objective, right?
- Right.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.783
You and Rene were
supposed to be backup.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.946
- Where'd you go?
- We were looking for Lance.

36:50.417 --> 36:52.659
And from what I can tell,
we found him.

36:52.752 --> 36:54.368
Moving off of your position,
was that

36:55.296 --> 36:56.503
your call or Curtis'?

36:56.589 --> 36:59.206
- Look, I was right there beside him...
- It was my call.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.043
And it turned out to be right one.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.049
You got lucky, Rene.
It doesn't make it the right call.

37:04.139 --> 37:05.129
Look, man,

37:05.765 --> 37:07.301
I know you're pissed at me

37:07.726 --> 37:08.762
and I don't care.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.559
Because you left us blind out there.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.886
And I wasn't gonna let Lance die

37:11.980 --> 37:13.221
just because you didn't
trust us enough

37:13.314 --> 37:14.646
to go off leash and look for him.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.771
When you are in the field,
there is a clear chain of command.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.894
Plain and simple.

37:19.988 --> 37:21.980
I've been the same guy tonight
that I've always been

37:22.073 --> 37:25.066
- since you brought me onto this team.
- Rene, yes, that's true, you have.

37:25.869 --> 37:27.735
- Sometimes you go your own way.
- That's right.

37:27.912 --> 37:30.746
And I put up with it
because I trusted you.

37:30.915 --> 37:31.905
What's that supposed to mean?

37:32.125 --> 37:33.912
<i>You got a second chance tonight,
my friend.</i>

37:34.586 --> 37:36.293
And you broke our trust again.

37:38.006 --> 37:38.996
You don't get a third.

37:41.468 --> 37:42.458
You're off the team.

37:43.428 --> 37:45.966
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.133
It's been real, y'all.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.641
You know, I hate to say it,
but Oliver is right.

37:59.861 --> 38:02.854
We're a team,
we need to trust each other.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.651
We need to believe in each other.

38:07.535 --> 38:08.946
I don't believe in you anymore.

38:10.663 --> 38:11.995
- Dinah.
- Don't.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.073
It's too late.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.367
I'm out, too.

38:34.479 --> 38:37.563
Guess we should both be glad
I didn't leave town like you said.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.392
Oh, thanks. That's really
what I needed right now,

38:40.485 --> 38:41.726
an "I told you so."

38:41.820 --> 38:44.403
Are you okay? You don't look it.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.236
I really don't want to talk about it.

38:49.452 --> 38:50.568
Then why'd you reach out?

38:50.912 --> 38:52.403
'Cause I had no one else to call.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.454
I'll try not to be insulted by that.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.960
I really needed someone who

39:01.881 --> 39:02.871
believed in me.

39:04.634 --> 39:06.045
I needed a friend.

39:07.303 --> 39:08.293
Friends?

39:10.515 --> 39:11.505
I can do that.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.231
Sunflowers. My favorite.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.976
Well, I wanted it to feel like home.

39:26.322 --> 39:28.985
I'm not gonna have to
leave again, am I?

39:29.158 --> 39:30.148
Hey.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.659
I won't let anyone
split us up ever again.

39:34.747 --> 39:35.737
I promise.

39:43.590 --> 39:44.580
I'm just gonna say this.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.798
I don't think there's
anything that has been said or done

39:46.885 --> 39:51.129
- that can't be undone.
- I don't think I agree, John.

39:51.472 --> 39:52.633
OLIVER: <i>I agree with Felicity.</i>

39:53.182 --> 39:54.172
We need to move forward.

39:54.893 --> 39:55.883
Sorry I'm late.

39:56.978 --> 39:59.220
I think I probably
might still be a little hungover.

40:00.023 --> 40:02.140
<i>I've also been thinking about
a few things.</i>

40:04.444 --> 40:06.401
Oliver, you and Dinah were right.

40:07.113 --> 40:09.105
<i>No trust, no team.</i>

40:10.366 --> 40:13.154
(SIGHS) You all spied on me.

40:15.038 --> 40:16.028
Invaded my privacy.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.327
Now, whether you couldn't
trust me or not,

40:22.086 --> 40:23.372
it means that I can't trust you.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.254
Curtis, what's that supposed to mean?

40:25.590 --> 40:28.003
I'm still a part of
Helix Dynamics, Felicity.

40:28.676 --> 40:29.666
That's separate.

40:30.178 --> 40:31.168
But...

40:31.888 --> 40:32.878
This...

40:38.519 --> 40:39.555
I'm done.

40:50.198 --> 40:52.531
(CLEARS THROAT)
Like I said, we need to move forward.

40:52.617 --> 40:54.153
- Oliver...
- Cayden James knew

40:54.494 --> 40:56.406
that we sabotaged the amplifier
last night.

40:57.997 --> 40:58.987
We need to find out how.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.704
When you had me raid their bunker

41:06.798 --> 41:08.915
and plant that mini-cam
two months ago...

41:09.425 --> 41:12.543
Is this the outcome I had in mind?
Quite so, Ms. Lance.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.503
Although I must confess,

41:15.390 --> 41:18.007
things have worked out
even better than I anticipated.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.466
ANATOLY: <i>Hardly impressive.</i>

41:20.395 --> 41:21.977
Left to his own devices,

41:23.147 --> 41:26.561
Oliver Queen will always push away
those closest to him.

41:27.110 --> 41:30.729
So we've got 'em fighting with
each other instead of fighting us.

41:31.990 --> 41:32.980
Please tell me

41:34.033 --> 41:35.990
that isn't your whole master plan.

41:36.202 --> 41:37.818
Oh, not at all, Mr. Diaz.

41:37.912 --> 41:40.825
In fact, I think it fair to say
that this

41:42.000 --> 41:43.616
is only the beginning.
