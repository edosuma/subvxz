00:04.163 --> 00:06.154
Six days to Disney World!

00:06.254 --> 00:08.495
We are going to Disney
world in six days, people!

00:08.495 --> 00:11.243
It is six days away! Can you believe it?!

00:11.343 --> 00:13.880
- [Sighs]
- Sue, really, you have to pace yourself.

00:13.880 --> 00:14.844
[Breathes deeply]

00:14.846 --> 00:16.983
Frankie: I know it sounds like
I'm raining on Sue's parade,

00:17.083 --> 00:18.584
but you got to understand

00:18.584 --> 00:21.153
this started the day she won the trip.

00:21.153 --> 00:23.189
27 days to Disney World!

00:23.189 --> 00:24.290
- 26 days to Disney
- [Gasps]

00:24.290 --> 00:25.458
- [Toilet flushes]
- Ooh, sorry, sorry.

00:25.458 --> 00:27.260
25 days to Disney World!

00:27.260 --> 00:29.996
Hey, she didn't say anything today.

00:30.496 --> 00:33.633
24 days 'till Disney World! Haa!

00:33.933 --> 00:35.068
You get the idea.

00:35.268 --> 00:36.936
I'm gonna go work on my Disney binder.

00:37.136 --> 00:38.605
Right now, it's 800 pages,

00:38.605 --> 00:40.139
but I think I should pare it down.

00:40.239 --> 00:43.442
Oh, by the way, we need more
computer paper and glitter.

00:43.442 --> 00:46.012
[Sighs]

00:46.012 --> 00:48.314
Well, that's a heavy sigh of excitement.

00:48.314 --> 00:50.316
Can you get the blue bag down for me?

00:50.316 --> 00:51.651
Why don't I just save you some time?

00:51.651 --> 00:52.451
I'll fill it with food,

00:52.451 --> 00:54.620
and we'll throw it on the side of the road.

00:54.620 --> 00:55.555
I know, right?

00:55.555 --> 00:58.157
I mean, it's a free vacation. It's good.

00:58.157 --> 00:59.125
Yeah. It's great.

00:59.125 --> 01:01.327
And I know it'll be fun once we get there.

01:01.327 --> 01:04.230
It's just that the getting
there is such a thing.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.699
Yeah, I feel like we're already here.

01:06.699 --> 01:08.334
We've got toget there.

01:08.334 --> 01:09.669
20 hours in the car with Axl?

01:09.669 --> 01:11.671
- [Groans]
- I can see the whole trip.

01:11.671 --> 01:13.039
I know what's coming.

01:13.039 --> 01:16.208
Okay, somewhere along the way,
the blue bag will disappear,

01:16.208 --> 01:17.510
then you'll throw your back out,

01:17.510 --> 01:19.746
Sue will cry, Axl will snark,

01:19.846 --> 01:21.548
Brick will lose something,
we'll lose Brick,

01:22.048 --> 01:23.182
and then we'll all start fighting.

01:23.182 --> 01:25.318
- But it's good.
- Yeah.

01:25.318 --> 01:27.320
Hey, since we're traveling
to Florida anyway,

01:27.320 --> 01:29.689
can we stop in North Carolina
and see my girlfriend.

01:29.789 --> 01:32.024
Wait, is this the girl you've
been playing computer games with?

01:32.224 --> 01:34.193
'Cause... she's not your girlfriend.

01:34.193 --> 01:35.428
She's not even a friend.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.663
In fact, she may not even be a girl.

01:37.663 --> 01:39.432
Oh, she is very much my girlfriend.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.501
We're on level 7 of
"The Mists of Khartoum."

01:42.501 --> 01:44.170
Last week, I gave her a conjuring wand,

01:44.170 --> 01:46.205
and she gave me two cloaking potions, so...

01:46.205 --> 01:48.541
- [Clicks tongue]
- Yeah, it's pretty serious.

01:48.541 --> 01:52.712
Okay, so, you want us to drive
hundreds of miles out of our way

01:52.712 --> 01:54.714
so you can visit a girl you've never seen

01:54.714 --> 01:56.582
- or actually spoken to.
- Right.

01:56.582 --> 01:58.584
So, what day should I
tell her we'll be there?

01:58.684 --> 02:01.087
[Sighs]

02:01.387 --> 02:02.622
[Groans]

02:06.025 --> 02:07.493
- [Sighs]
- What are you doing?

02:07.493 --> 02:08.828
Why are you sitting here?

02:08.928 --> 02:10.530
Relax. I just want to talk.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.632
I'm, uh, kind of wondering what it's like

02:12.632 --> 02:15.601
to try something and fail,
which is why I'm coming to you,

02:15.601 --> 02:18.170
the... biggest failure I know.

02:18.170 --> 02:19.472
Aww.

02:19.472 --> 02:22.141
Wait. Did you try at something?

02:22.141 --> 02:24.010
What? No. Shut up.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.145
- You did!
- [Gasps]

02:25.146 --> 02:26.444
You tried at something.

02:26.445 --> 02:28.047
- [Gasps]
- Is it ventriloquism? Is it yoga?

02:28.047 --> 02:29.583
Is it trying to get a butterfly
to land on your finger?!

02:29.884 --> 02:30.482
No!

02:30.583 --> 02:33.552
What are you ev... look,
fine. I tried at school, okay?

02:33.552 --> 02:36.222
Axl, that's amazing!

02:36.222 --> 02:38.691
Isn't it just so fun to try your hardest?

02:38.691 --> 02:40.393
- So, what's the problem?
- [Sighs]

02:40.393 --> 02:43.129
The problem is I'm waiting
for them to post the Grades.

02:43.129 --> 02:44.397
You know, I've always been

02:44.397 --> 02:46.265
maybe a smart guy who didn't apply himself.

02:46.265 --> 02:49.735
But if I apply myself and
fail, I might just be dumb.

02:49.735 --> 02:51.404
So then you'll try again.

02:51.404 --> 02:53.839
You know what, Sue? Your advice sucks.

02:53.839 --> 02:56.008
You failed at this conversation.

02:56.108 --> 02:57.743
Well, I'm gonna keep trying!

02:57.743 --> 02:59.645
[Groans]

02:59.645 --> 03:02.048
- [TV chatter]
- Mom is moving out!

03:02.048 --> 03:02.849
I knew it!

03:02.849 --> 03:04.750
I knew she didn't have the
stomach to go the distance.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.285
Frankie: You're not gonna believe this.

03:06.285 --> 03:08.421
I'm packed. I'm totally packed.

03:08.421 --> 03:10.857
I even bought one of those
mini travel toothpastes,

03:10.857 --> 03:12.925
which is already in my toiletry bag.

03:13.225 --> 03:15.227
Old people brag about the weirdest things.

03:15.227 --> 03:17.697
No, you know, last night,
your dad and I were talking,

03:17.697 --> 03:20.399
and we realized that
every time we take a trip,

03:20.399 --> 03:22.101
the same thing happens, right, Mike?

03:22.101 --> 03:24.470
Back, cry, forget, snark, fight.

03:24.670 --> 03:26.972
And nobody likes that. Do you like that?

03:26.972 --> 03:28.541
- [Both]
- No. No. No. No.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.544
Nobody does. And then it hit me.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.079
It doesn't have to be that way.

03:34.079 --> 03:37.015
We won a free trip to Disney World.

03:37.015 --> 03:38.284
We won new luggage.

03:38.284 --> 03:42.088
We're winners, and we have to
start thinking like winners.

03:42.088 --> 03:44.123
I'm all for it, but you're
fighting History here.

03:44.523 --> 03:47.794
Well, if we start to feel crabby... Mike...

03:47.794 --> 03:49.962
Or start to get negative... Axl...

03:49.962 --> 03:53.733
We'll have a safe word that
will remind us that we're winners

03:53.733 --> 03:55.968
and bring us back to our winning attitude.

03:55.968 --> 03:57.636
How about "Sue's a freak"?

03:57.636 --> 03:59.638
- That's a phrase, not a word.
- Sue: Oh!

03:59.638 --> 04:01.607
How about "Orlando"?

04:01.607 --> 04:03.709
Orlando.

04:03.709 --> 04:06.378
Orland-o-o-o.

04:06.378 --> 04:07.646
Orlando.

04:07.646 --> 04:09.348
Orlando.

04:09.348 --> 04:11.283
It works.

04:19.101 --> 04:22.157
I'd like to revisit the whole
not-visiting-my-girlfriend decision.

04:22.157 --> 04:24.759
- Uh-huh.
- I don't think you're quite getting

04:24.759 --> 04:27.662
what this means to me...
emotionally, socially,

04:27.662 --> 04:28.797
in my development as a man.

04:28.797 --> 04:31.800
I mean, this is my first real relationship.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.803
Tanya and I have chatted every
night for the last two months.

04:34.803 --> 04:37.306
Plus, I've kind of already
promised her we're coming.

04:37.306 --> 04:39.074
So, what are you thinking?

04:39.074 --> 04:40.642
That I should know

04:40.642 --> 04:42.644
that my son's been online
with a girl every night.

04:42.644 --> 04:44.713
Do they sell alcohol at Disney World?

04:44.713 --> 04:45.714
So many things.

04:45.714 --> 04:47.415
The answer was still no.

04:47.515 --> 04:51.353
Unfortunately, Brick's mind
was less scattered than mine,

04:51.353 --> 04:54.389
and he remained focused on just one thing.

04:54.389 --> 04:55.924
I wouldn't ask if we weren't already

04:55.924 --> 04:57.125
going in that general direction.

04:57.125 --> 04:59.294
It's just that Tanya really understands me.

04:59.383 --> 05:01.329
What if we eventually get
married and have grandkids?

05:01.329 --> 05:03.198
And years later, you'll say,

05:03.198 --> 05:05.000
"thank God we went to North Carolina.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.703
Otherwise, we wouldn't have
these adorable grandkids."

05:07.703 --> 05:08.107
[Water running]

05:08.109 --> 05:09.671
I hear they have good
jams in North Carolina.

05:09.671 --> 05:11.706
Plus, they're famous for their pecans,

05:11.706 --> 05:13.441
and they're the third largest
producer of sweet potatoes.

05:13.441 --> 05:16.211
You love sweet potatoes.

05:16.211 --> 05:18.680
Look, Brick, I do love sweet potatoes,

05:18.680 --> 05:21.449
but I'm not the one you got to convince.

05:22.851 --> 05:26.588
- So, Mike...
- [Sighs]

05:26.588 --> 05:29.591
I wanted to talk to you about something.

05:29.591 --> 05:31.493
I know this is gonna
sound a little crazy...

05:31.693 --> 05:34.662
- Well, a lot crazy, super-duper crazy...
- [Sighs]

05:34.662 --> 05:38.666
But maybe we should think
about going to North Carolina.

05:38.666 --> 05:41.403
- [Chuckles]
- You're kidding.

05:41.403 --> 05:42.470
Frankie...

05:42.470 --> 05:44.038
You were the one who's been talking about

05:44.038 --> 05:46.441
how this is gonna be a winning trip.

05:46.441 --> 05:48.310
And now you're throwing that into the mix?

05:48.310 --> 05:50.345
That's not Orlando thinking.

05:50.345 --> 05:54.749
Okay, look, Brick and this
girl have a connection.

05:54.749 --> 05:57.185
Brick has a connection
with another human being.

05:57.185 --> 05:59.120
I mean, I saw a picture. She looks cute.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.556
Seriously? North Carolina?

06:01.556 --> 06:03.625
W-why can't he find someone here in Orson?

06:03.625 --> 06:05.527
He's known here, Mike.

06:05.527 --> 06:07.796
You're lucky we're not
having to go off to Europe.

06:07.796 --> 06:10.932
I mean, look, they have
been talking for two months.

06:10.932 --> 06:12.600
You know he said something weird.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.836
And they're still together.
That has to mean something.

06:14.836 --> 06:16.771
Yeah, that she's even weirder than he is.

06:16.771 --> 06:18.440
Yeah, well, so what if she is?

06:18.440 --> 06:19.474
This is someone Brick likes

06:19.474 --> 06:22.477
and has liked for a
significant amount of time.

06:22.477 --> 06:24.446
That's huge for Brick.

06:24.446 --> 06:27.449
I mean, it all sounds very Orlando to me.

06:27.449 --> 06:28.783
So, we're just gonna show up

06:28.783 --> 06:30.985
at some girl's house in North Carolina.

06:30.985 --> 06:33.087
That is the craziest
thing you've ever said.

06:33.087 --> 06:35.757
- [Sighs]
- Okay... look at it this way.

06:35.757 --> 06:38.326
What if, by some miracle,

06:38.326 --> 06:41.629
she turns out to be the
right person for him,

06:41.629 --> 06:44.666
the love of his life, and
they end up getting married

06:44.666 --> 06:47.469
and giving us adorable grandkids.

06:47.469 --> 06:50.538
Yeah, he tried that on
me, too. What else you got?

06:52.674 --> 06:55.543
Hey.

06:55.543 --> 06:56.511
What's wrong?

06:56.511 --> 06:58.380
- Grades are up.
- [Inhales sharply]

06:58.380 --> 07:00.715
Ohh, no, I can't look. You look for me.

07:00.715 --> 07:02.550
[Breathes deeply]

07:02.550 --> 07:04.652
[Grunts]

07:04.652 --> 07:07.489
Uh... you got a "B".

07:07.489 --> 07:09.624
I got to be what, Sue?

07:09.624 --> 07:12.627
- No, in English, you got a "B".
- What?

07:12.627 --> 07:13.829
- I got a "B"?
- Mm-hmm.

07:14.229 --> 07:17.132
You're kidding. Uh, what about psychology?

07:17.132 --> 07:18.333
- Oh, a "B"!
- [Gasps]

07:18.633 --> 07:19.701
And History?

07:19.701 --> 07:21.603
- Another "B".
- World religions?!

07:21.603 --> 07:22.637
[Grunts]

07:22.637 --> 07:24.839
- A B-minus.
- [Gasps]

07:24.839 --> 07:26.841
- Which still counts as a "B".
- Mm.

07:26.841 --> 07:28.343
I got all B's.

07:28.343 --> 07:31.613
You can't get any better than that! Whoo!

07:31.613 --> 07:33.681
I got all B's!

07:33.681 --> 07:34.617
- What?
- Yeah!

07:34.618 --> 07:35.416
[Claps]

07:35.417 --> 07:37.251
I got all B's in college. I got all B's.

07:37.251 --> 07:38.486
I'm a straight-up "B" student!

07:38.586 --> 07:41.155
- Oh, my God! Axl, we're so proud of you!
-  Way to go, Axl! Wow.

07:41.155 --> 07:42.290
Yeah.

07:42.290 --> 07:43.659
You know what this means?

07:43.759 --> 07:44.993
In your face!

07:45.693 --> 07:47.395
What? What are you talking about?

07:47.395 --> 07:48.563
The deal.

07:48.563 --> 07:49.564
Don't you have a test tomorrow?

07:49.564 --> 07:52.700
I got it under control. Relax.

07:52.700 --> 07:54.202
Okay, fine, we'll leave you alone.

07:54.202 --> 07:56.337
But if you don't get at
least B's this semester,

07:56.337 --> 07:57.439
you're moving home.

07:57.439 --> 07:59.941
Fine, but if I do get all B's,

07:59.941 --> 08:01.843
you can't talk to me all summer.

08:01.843 --> 08:03.578
- Fine.
- Yeah, you got it.

08:03.678 --> 08:05.313
Bam! Have a great summer.

08:05.313 --> 08:06.714
I'll hear you in September.

08:06.714 --> 08:09.350
Come on, Axl. The point
is you did a great job,

08:09.350 --> 08:10.818
- and we're proud of...
- I'm sorry.

08:10.818 --> 08:12.253
Why are you talking to me?

08:12.253 --> 08:13.422
You're not allowed to talk to me.

08:13.422 --> 08:14.056
[Sighs]

08:14.058 --> 08:15.791
We're not going the
whole summer without...

08:15.890 --> 08:17.725
Ba-ba-ba-buh-buh. Save
it for September 1st.

08:17.725 --> 08:20.728
I'll "B" in my room B'ing awesome.

08:20.728 --> 08:22.564
"B" -bye.

08:22.564 --> 08:23.631
[Both sigh]

08:23.631 --> 08:25.400
Ooh, Brick, come here.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.701
I have a really big surprise for you.

08:26.701 --> 08:28.570
What is it?

08:28.570 --> 08:30.638
Well, your dad and I talked it over...

08:30.638 --> 08:32.740
Not because you were bugging me...

08:32.740 --> 08:36.578
And we have decided that we are gonna stop

08:36.578 --> 08:38.712
and visit your girlfriend 
in North Carolina.

08:38.712 --> 08:42.015
Wow, that's great! Thanks! Whoop!

08:42.015 --> 08:42.717
Whoop.

08:43.116 --> 08:43.717
Whoop!

08:44.118 --> 08:44.719
Whoop.

08:45.019 --> 08:45.720
Whoop!

08:45.720 --> 08:46.754
Whoop.

08:46.754 --> 08:47.589
- [Sighs]
- Whoop!

08:47.589 --> 08:49.457
Yeah, we're never having grandkids.

08:56.823 --> 08:59.263
So, finally, we were on
our way to Disney World.

08:59.263 --> 09:02.199
And no one was more excited than Sue.

09:02.199 --> 09:04.702
To be fair, no one was
ever more excited than Sue

09:04.702 --> 09:06.658
about anything... ever.

09:06.660 --> 09:08.972
I made 14 different 
playlists for the drive.

09:09.072 --> 09:10.340
- ["Disney's electrical parade" plays]
- This one is the Disney

09:10.340 --> 09:11.775
main street electrical parade soundtrack.

09:11.775 --> 09:14.645
- Isn't it amazing?
- [Laughs]

09:15.746 --> 09:17.748
Let's play the license-plate game!

09:17.748 --> 09:20.418
- [Gasps]
- Oh, Indiana! One point for me.

09:20.418 --> 09:24.388
1,114 miles to Disney World!

09:24.388 --> 09:28.292
Coming up on 1,113 miles to Disney World!

09:28.292 --> 09:28.842
[Gasps]

09:28.844 --> 09:30.628
Okay, Sue, why don't we
try that every 50 miles?

09:30.628 --> 09:32.963
And, Axl, make sure you get some rest

09:32.963 --> 09:34.698
'cause you're coming up
in the driving rotation.

09:34.698 --> 09:37.368
Axl? Axl?

09:37.368 --> 09:40.571
I feel like someone's talking
to me, but that's not possible...

09:40.571 --> 09:41.939
'Cause you're not allowed to talk to me.

09:41.939 --> 09:43.741
We're allowed to talk to you, right, Axl?

09:43.841 --> 09:45.409
I'm not encouraging it, but, yes.

09:45.409 --> 09:48.178
Axl, there's some basic things
we have to talk to you about.

09:48.178 --> 09:50.081
- [Coughs]
- Sue, tell Axl

09:50.081 --> 09:52.116
there's some basic things
we have to talk to him about.

09:52.116 --> 09:53.984
Look, I-it's just the
beginning of the summer,

09:53.984 --> 09:55.286
and you're already failing.

09:55.286 --> 09:57.721
We're gonna have to institute
some kind of Penalty System

09:57.721 --> 09:58.722
so you'll learn.

09:58.722 --> 09:59.690
- [Inhales deeply]
- I got it.

09:59.690 --> 10:02.293
You owe me $50 every time you talk to me.

10:02.293 --> 10:05.028
- We're not doing that.
- That's $50 right there.

10:05.028 --> 10:07.764
- Axl, we're not paying you $50...
- That's $100.

10:07.764 --> 10:09.366
- Oh, you heard that.
- That's $150.

10:09.366 --> 10:11.168
- You want to go for $200?
- How dumb do you think...

10:11.168 --> 10:12.069
Mike, stop talking!

10:12.069 --> 10:15.406
- So, where am I on the driving rotation?
- [Sighs]

10:15.906 --> 10:19.075
Um... y-you're like the alternate

10:19.075 --> 10:21.211
in case we need you to drive.

10:21.211 --> 10:23.380
- But we won't.
- But why?

10:23.380 --> 10:24.615
You're still kind of young.

10:24.615 --> 10:26.850
Axl drove us to Hershey
Park when he was my age.

10:27.350 --> 10:29.320
Besides, I'm the one who won us the trip.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.755
And you're saying you don't
trust me enough to drive?

10:31.755 --> 10:33.757
You trusted me enough to
leave my hand on that car

10:33.757 --> 10:34.892
for 24 hours.

10:34.892 --> 10:36.427
I peed a little bit in my pants.

10:36.527 --> 10:37.394
I deserve to drive.

10:37.394 --> 10:39.095
All right, fine, you can take my shift.

10:39.195 --> 10:40.663
- [Sighs]
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

10:40.663 --> 10:42.966
Before I'm riding in any
car that Sue's driving,

10:42.966 --> 10:45.969
we need to be very clear on
the status of the death napkin.

10:46.269 --> 10:48.439
Whoa! Why is it every
time we get in the car

10:48.439 --> 10:50.774
we end up talking about mom and dad's will?

10:51.274 --> 10:54.244
It's written on a napkin, Axl.
It'll never hold up in court.

10:54.244 --> 10:55.112
W... so how does that work?

10:55.112 --> 10:56.246
Uh, say Sue's driving,

10:56.546 --> 10:57.716
and mom and dad are the only ones
that get wiped out?

10:57.717 --> 10:58.415
Okay, shh!

10:58.416 --> 11:00.784
Look, really, the death
napkin doesn't matter anymore.

11:00.784 --> 11:01.719
Axl's 19.

11:01.719 --> 11:03.887
If anything happens to us,
he'll take care of all of you.

11:03.887 --> 11:05.589
I'm gonna be doing things very differently.

11:05.789 --> 11:07.925
First thing... you're both
getting jobs right away.

11:07.925 --> 11:09.927
Sue's gonna have to learn
how to cook, and you guys

11:09.927 --> 11:11.929
are gonna have to start
picking up around the house.

11:11.929 --> 11:13.730
Brick, tell your brother he's an idiot.

11:13.730 --> 11:14.932
I don't want to say that to him.

11:14.932 --> 11:16.933
If he's gonna be in charge of me,
I got to stay on his good side.

11:16.933 --> 11:18.902
You're my favorite, Brick. I
might even let you sleep inside.

11:18.902 --> 11:20.904
- Brick: Ah.
- Why is he your favorite?

11:20.904 --> 11:23.640
So I'm neither of my dads' favorites? Fine.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.442
I am gonna go live with Aunt Janet.

11:25.442 --> 11:27.444
But, wait, I am not talking about this

11:27.444 --> 11:30.013
because no one is going to
crash and nobody is going to die.

11:30.013 --> 11:31.882
You're right, Sue. We're not all gonna die.

11:31.882 --> 11:34.618
Some of us might just be
burnt beyond recognition.

11:34.618 --> 11:36.219
If some of us are burned
beyond recognition,

11:36.219 --> 11:37.354
can we still go to Disney World?

11:37.354 --> 11:39.790
I mean, after we pay our
respects to the less fortunate.

11:39.790 --> 11:40.657
Why did you look at me, Brick?

11:40.757 --> 11:42.759
You're the one who drove
us into oncoming traffic.

11:42.759 --> 11:44.761
You killed us all, Sue. Good job.

11:44.761 --> 11:46.764
- Axl.
- Hey! Stop talking to me!

11:46.764 --> 11:48.632
- Yeah, we're not doing that anymore.
- Fine.

11:48.832 --> 11:50.601
If you're not willing to give me

11:50.601 --> 11:51.668
the reward that's rightfully mine,

11:51.668 --> 11:53.270
I will just have to come up with something

11:53.270 --> 11:55.038
of equal or greater value.

11:55.038 --> 11:58.041
Okay, from now on, I will listen to you

11:58.041 --> 12:02.841
provided you address me as
"Sir Axl, Duke of awesomeness."

12:02.846 --> 12:04.915
Seriously? That's what you want?

12:04.915 --> 12:06.583
I can't hear you.

12:06.583 --> 12:09.419
That's what you want, Sir
Axl, Duke of awesomeness?

12:09.419 --> 12:11.755
- It is-ith.
- You're really gonna call him that?

12:11.755 --> 12:13.891
Why does he always get what he wants?

12:13.891 --> 12:15.592
I can't drive, but we all have to call him

12:15.592 --> 12:17.895
Sir Axl, Duke of awesomeness?
Well, I am not gonna do that.

12:17.895 --> 12:20.297
Well, fine, then I'm not talking
to you for the rest of the trip.

12:20.297 --> 12:22.799
Sir Sxl, Duke of awesomeness,
stop being mean to your sister!

12:22.799 --> 12:24.300
I don't want Axl to be my dad.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.269
Well, if Sue gets behind
the wheel, I will be!

12:26.269 --> 12:27.237
[Imitates tires screeching, explosion]

12:27.237 --> 12:28.772
- Stop it. Stop it!
- Okay, let's...

12:28.772 --> 12:29.773
- She'll kill us all!
- Stop it, Axl! That is so mean!

12:29.773 --> 12:31.608
Let's cut the talk about
the fiery crash, okay?

12:31.608 --> 12:33.344
- We're going to Disney World!
- Orlando!

12:33.544 --> 12:34.545
Come on, now!

12:34.545 --> 12:37.347
We're all falling back
into our old bad habits.

12:37.347 --> 12:39.650
That's not gonna happen on this trip.

12:39.650 --> 12:40.984
That's negative thinking.

12:40.984 --> 12:42.819
We got to be positive, like winners.

12:42.819 --> 12:43.987
Sue is gonna drive,

12:43.987 --> 12:46.723
and everything is gonna be just fine.

12:46.723 --> 12:47.958
[Horn blares]

12:47.958 --> 12:50.994
You can give it a little more gas, Sue.

12:50.994 --> 12:53.630
- [Tires squeal]
- [Grunts]

12:53.630 --> 12:56.066
Maybe we can have Sue pull over,
and we can get something to eat.

12:56.066 --> 12:58.802
[All together]: Yeah! So hungry! Let's
stop immediately. Mm-hmm.

12:58.802 --> 13:01.772
Uh, okay, I'd like, uh, two number 2s

13:01.772 --> 13:04.708
and two number 3s, uh,
one with cheese and...

13:04.708 --> 13:06.076
Axl: Uh, I want the cheese fries.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.811
- Brick: No cheese for me.
- Just remember that. Three number 3s.

13:07.811 --> 13:08.845
- I'll order... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
- Tell her I want the cheese fries!

13:08.845 --> 13:10.180
- Jumbo size it!
- Let her order.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.214
One number 2

13:11.214 --> 13:13.516
- and three number 3s...
- Well, don't change it now.

13:13.516 --> 13:15.185
- And one number 4.
- I want the cheeseburger.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.486
[All talking]

13:16.486 --> 13:17.354
- One... oh, no, no, no, no.
- Brick: Maybe do a price check.

13:17.354 --> 13:18.421
- It was supposed to be 3 and 2.
- 3... I-I can't...

13:18.421 --> 13:21.392
I can't have all of you
yelling at me all at once!

13:21.392 --> 13:23.928
- Okay, mom. I see how that's annoying.
- Here.

13:24.028 --> 13:26.163
Just give us five number 3s with cheese.

13:26.463 --> 13:28.999
Or, if it's easier for
you, five unhappy meals.

13:28.999 --> 13:30.534
Go.

13:30.534 --> 13:32.569
[Engine turns over]

13:32.569 --> 13:35.739
I'm not so good at tight spaces.

13:35.739 --> 13:36.707
[Tires screech]

13:39.776 --> 13:41.578
Frankie: A-Axl, look out your window.

13:41.578 --> 13:42.913
Tell her how much space she has.

13:42.913 --> 13:43.415
[Metal scrapes]

13:43.417 --> 13:44.581
- Aah!
- Not much.

13:44.781 --> 13:46.516
- Damn it, Sue!
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

13:46.516 --> 13:48.819
I have spudsy money! I
will... I will pay you back.

13:48.819 --> 13:51.288
- Just back up and go around the post.
- [Whines]

13:51.288 --> 13:54.825
- [Metal scrapes]
- Around the post, Sue!

13:54.825 --> 13:56.793
- Well, I am.
- No, don't just drag it!

13:56.793 --> 13:58.028
Go around the post!

13:58.028 --> 13:59.029
- Aah!
- [Crunch]

13:59.029 --> 14:01.897
- Oh, no, no! Stop the thing!
- [Tires squeal]

14:01.897 --> 14:04.467
- [Groans]
- Back up!

14:04.467 --> 14:06.402
- [All shouting]
- [Scraping continues]

14:06.402 --> 14:07.870
Aah!

14:07.870 --> 14:08.539
[Whimpers]

14:08.539 --> 14:09.573
Damn it, Sue! Stop!

14:09.773 --> 14:11.675
Get out of the car.

14:11.675 --> 14:13.477
[Groans]

14:13.477 --> 14:14.611
- [Door handle rattles]
- [Groans]

14:14.611 --> 14:16.380
It's stuck.

14:16.380 --> 14:18.783
Is it bad?

14:18.883 --> 14:20.684
Only if you want to get
in and out of the car.

14:24.188 --> 14:25.489
[Grunts]

14:25.889 --> 14:27.891
All right, that's it.
You're out of the rotation.

14:27.891 --> 14:29.292
You're never driving again.

14:35.732 --> 14:37.801
Hey. Look.

14:37.801 --> 14:39.970
They gave us extra fries.

14:39.970 --> 14:42.906
- Orlando.

Advertise your product or brand here

14:53.946 --> 14:55.982
So, four hours and two
states out of our way,

14:55.982 --> 14:57.550
we made the quick stop

14:57.550 --> 15:00.419
somewhere outside of
Greenville, North Carolina,

15:00.419 --> 15:02.722
to have Brick meet his girlfriend.

15:02.722 --> 15:04.724
People do things for their kids, okay?

15:04.724 --> 15:06.859
- All right, we're here.
- [Crickets chirping]

15:06.859 --> 15:09.896
This is it? Really?

15:09.896 --> 15:12.598
I would have thought Disney
World would be a little fancier.

15:12.598 --> 15:14.334
- [Engine shuts off]
- Frankie: No.

15:14.334 --> 15:16.336
This is your girlfriend's
house. We're here.

15:16.736 --> 15:17.870
- [Dog barks]
- Oh.

15:17.870 --> 15:21.307
Did I not mention that
we broke up last night?

15:21.308 --> 15:22.675
- You're kidding.
- Brick! What?!

15:22.675 --> 15:23.776
When mom and dad are
dead, you are so grounded.

15:23.776 --> 15:25.578
- [Sighs]
- No. You did not, Brick.

15:25.578 --> 15:27.513
You did not... mention that.

15:27.513 --> 15:29.882
You don't understand... she
went through the Jelly Gates

15:29.882 --> 15:31.984
and into the Golden
Castle of Akbar without me.

15:32.084 --> 15:34.086
I mean, how can I have a
relationship with someone

15:34.086 --> 15:35.421
who would do something like that?

15:35.421 --> 15:37.757
Do her parents even know you broke up?

15:37.757 --> 15:40.593
Hmm. Good question.

15:40.593 --> 15:42.628
Well, we're going in there,

15:42.628 --> 15:43.929
and you are gonna do the right thing.

15:43.929 --> 15:44.897
You're gonna look her in the eye

15:44.897 --> 15:46.766
and apologize to her face to face.

15:46.766 --> 15:49.535
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He met
this girl on the Internet?

15:49.535 --> 15:51.037
This is getting creepy.

15:51.037 --> 15:54.073
- No, I talked to the mom.
-  No, Axl's right.

15:54.073 --> 15:56.576
This could be a complete catfish situation.

15:56.576 --> 15:58.744
How do you know the mom
isn't the little girl?

15:58.744 --> 16:00.446
Look, a grandpa could be the little girl.

16:00.446 --> 16:01.647
Well, I'm not going in there.

16:01.647 --> 16:03.049
I don't want to wake up without a kidney.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.584
I can just see the headline.

16:04.584 --> 16:06.719
"'B' student slain in hillbilly massacre.

16:06.719 --> 16:08.588
'He was awesome, ' said friends."

16:08.588 --> 16:10.656
You're all being ridiculous.

16:10.656 --> 16:12.124
We're going in there, right, Mike?

16:12.124 --> 16:14.460
Uh...

16:16.462 --> 16:18.798
[TV chatter]

16:18.798 --> 16:20.800
- [Sighs]
- Hello?

16:20.800 --> 16:21.801
Sandy: You made it.

16:21.801 --> 16:24.737
Whew. Well, I'm glad you found us.

16:24.737 --> 16:26.739
Yeah, I didn't know if you
were still expecting us.

16:26.739 --> 16:28.708
Of course. Come on in.

16:28.708 --> 16:30.476
- Come in.
- [Laughs]

16:30.476 --> 16:33.679
So, hi. Uh, I'm Frankie. Nice to meet you.

16:33.679 --> 16:37.183
This is Mike and Sue and...

16:37.183 --> 16:38.851
[Clears throat]

16:38.851 --> 16:40.853
Sir Axl, Duke of awesomeness.

16:40.853 --> 16:42.421
- How's it going?
- [Clicks tongue]

16:42.421 --> 16:44.924
- And this, of course, is Brick.
- Hi.

16:44.924 --> 16:47.026
This is my husband, Phil... oh.

16:47.026 --> 16:50.826
And our daughter, Tanya.

16:50.831 --> 16:53.366
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:53.666 --> 16:56.769
Well, I'm sure you two
have plenty to talk about.

16:56.769 --> 16:59.972
Tanya, why don't you go
show Brick your dirt pile?

16:59.972 --> 17:02.975
Don't dig too deep, Brick.

17:02.975 --> 17:05.111
God knows what could be under there.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.512
Oh, have a seat.

17:06.512 --> 17:09.648
Come on, get up. Have a seat.

17:09.648 --> 17:11.817
- [TV turns off]
- Uh, dinner won't be ready for another...

17:11.817 --> 17:14.185
Ooh, 37 minutes,

17:14.185 --> 17:16.789
but y'all want some
peanut-butter crackers?

17:16.789 --> 17:18.624
Oh, hey, thanks. Yum.

17:18.624 --> 17:21.160
[Dog barking]

17:21.160 --> 17:22.795
Mexico, get out of here!

17:22.795 --> 17:24.530
[Mexico growls]

17:24.530 --> 17:25.798
[Chuckles]

17:25.798 --> 17:27.500
[Chuckles]

17:27.500 --> 17:29.802
So, we're on our way to Disney World.

17:29.802 --> 17:31.604
I think I mentioned that on the phone.

17:31.604 --> 17:32.705
We won it.

17:32.805 --> 17:35.341
We don't normally take trips like that.

17:35.341 --> 17:37.042
We had a Disney jar,

17:37.042 --> 17:39.412
not that there was ever any money in it.

17:39.512 --> 17:41.447
Our washing machine doesn't work very well.

17:41.447 --> 17:43.682
[Laughs nervously]

17:43.682 --> 17:48.782
Anyway... so, this is
kind of awkward, right?

17:48.854 --> 17:51.224
I don't know if you know. Maybe you do.

17:51.324 --> 17:52.858
But the kids broke up last night.

17:52.858 --> 17:54.460
W-what do you mean?

17:54.460 --> 17:56.829
Tanya broke up with your son?

17:56.829 --> 18:00.066
Uh, well, no.

18:00.066 --> 18:03.135
Uh, not exactly. Brick...
broke up with her.

18:03.135 --> 18:07.135
There was a, uh... Jelly-Gate situation.

18:07.474 --> 18:10.843
So, your son dumped our daughter?

18:10.843 --> 18:13.646
Why'd y'all come here for then?

18:13.646 --> 18:16.148
We were already here,

18:16.148 --> 18:19.752
and... it was the... right thing to... do.

18:19.752 --> 18:23.556
Oh, so, you drove eight
hours out of your way

18:23.556 --> 18:25.524
just to rub it in our faces.

18:25.524 --> 18:26.295
[Laughing]

18:26.296 --> 18:28.794
I'm sorry. Y'all got to be up to something.

18:28.795 --> 18:31.964
No sane person drives hundreds
of miles out of the way

18:31.964 --> 18:33.466
to meet a 12-year-old girl.

18:33.466 --> 18:35.734
- She's got a point.
- All right, just hold on.

18:35.734 --> 18:37.703
- We were...
- I know what this is.

18:37.703 --> 18:40.072
Y'all show up out of nowhere.

18:40.072 --> 18:42.575
He don't even look like his picture.

18:42.575 --> 18:44.710
Y'all are catfishing us.

18:46.579 --> 18:49.448
A-and I only went through the Jelly Gates

18:49.448 --> 18:50.750
'cause you were out of Golden Coins.

18:50.750 --> 18:54.086
But... but by the time I
got back, y-you were gone.

18:54.086 --> 18:56.455
- Really? I had no idea.
- Sandy: Get on out of here!

18:56.455 --> 18:57.690
Phil: Get out!

18:57.690 --> 19:00.292
Yeah, that's right! Get off our property!

19:00.292 --> 19:03.029
You think you can come here and catfish us,

19:03.029 --> 19:05.031
you and your... your weird kid!

19:05.031 --> 19:07.967
We're not catfishing
anybody. And we're not weird.

19:07.967 --> 19:10.736
We are decent people just
trying to do the right thing!

19:10.736 --> 19:13.806
If anybody's catfishing, you're catfishing.

19:13.806 --> 19:15.441
We are not catfish people.

19:15.441 --> 19:17.476
We're Orlando people.

19:17.476 --> 19:18.611
Mike, let's go.

19:21.147 --> 19:22.715
I got to get in this side.

19:22.715 --> 19:24.517
What? No, I already slammed it.

19:24.517 --> 19:27.019
But, Frankie, this is
the only way in. Remember?

19:27.019 --> 19:28.187
Yeah. I said we weren't weird.

19:28.187 --> 19:28.921
Now it's getting weird.

19:28.921 --> 19:30.789
Just storm off. I'll
pick you up on the corner.

19:30.789 --> 19:32.392
It's weirder you driving and me walking!

19:32.392 --> 19:34.427
All right, all right!

19:34.827 --> 19:38.130
I'm just letting him in.
We're still storming off.

19:38.130 --> 19:39.231
Brick, let's go.

19:39.231 --> 19:41.867
Brick, wait.

19:46.972 --> 19:49.041
I-I'm glad you came.

19:55.614 --> 19:58.484
Frankie: Wow. Brick's first kiss.

19:58.484 --> 20:01.120
That was way easier than I thought.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.055
Well, looks like I'm the only one

20:03.055 --> 20:04.690
who's kissed a girl on this trip.

20:04.690 --> 20:06.659
Who's the Duke of awesomeness now?

20:11.730 --> 20:13.866
Yep, if you change your frame of mind,

20:13.866 --> 20:16.535
everything falls into place.

20:16.535 --> 20:18.537
Axl got all B's,

20:18.537 --> 20:20.906
Brick got his first kiss,

20:20.906 --> 20:22.508
and Sue...

20:22.508 --> 20:23.776
Well...

20:28.481 --> 20:30.482
Wait. What are you doing?

20:30.482 --> 20:33.986
- Brick: What's going on?
- Sue: Why are we stopping?

20:33.986 --> 20:35.988
Get up here, Sue. Bring it home.

20:35.988 --> 20:37.690
I don't know, dad.

20:37.690 --> 20:40.126
I'll probably just drive
us all into the sign.

20:40.126 --> 20:42.661
Hey, you got this.

20:51.670 --> 20:55.141
[All together]: Orlando! Orlando!
Orlando! Orlando!

20:55.141 --> 20:57.810
[Cheering]

21:02.548 --> 21:06.485
Oh, my God. No days 'till Disney World!

21:06.485 --> 21:07.686
[Gasps]

21:07.686 --> 21:10.890
[Bell dinging]

21:10.890 --> 21:13.125
- Welcome to Disney World.
- Thank you.

21:13.125 --> 21:14.927
- [Chuckles]
- Wait.

21:15.027 --> 21:17.029
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

21:17.029 --> 21:20.499
These tickets are for
Disneyland in California.

21:20.499 --> 21:24.136
You do realize you're in Orlando.

21:28.007 --> 21:30.743
Orlando.

21:30.743 --> 21:32.745
