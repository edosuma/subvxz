Okay, Titans,
Halloween is tonight.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.436
The trick-or-treaters are
going to be out in force,

00:45.480 --> 00:46.742
and we need to be ready.

00:46.785 --> 00:48.787
Cyborg, Beast Boy,
you're on candy.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.702
Those trick-or-treaters
are gonna freak

00:50.746 --> 00:52.139
when they find out
we're handing out

00:52.182 --> 00:53.705
those full-size bars.

00:53.749 --> 00:56.099
Yeah, baby size is
for chumps, yo.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.058
Bold choice. I like it.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.625
Raven, Starfire,
you're on decorations.

01:00.669 --> 01:01.974
Let's give those
trick-or-treaters

01:02.018 --> 01:03.715
nightmares for weeks.

01:03.759 --> 01:06.109
Then let's get all the candy
and decorations we can find,

01:06.153 --> 01:07.937
so the fun can begin.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.983
Titans, go!

01:11.027 --> 01:14.726
Man, how's they not even
have any Halloween junk for sale?

01:14.770 --> 01:17.599
Not even a single plastic
spider ring.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.864
I can't believe we won't
have any candy to hand out.

01:21.907 --> 01:24.910
Don't sweat it, yo.
I gots the candy covered.

01:27.826 --> 01:28.697
From last year.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.655
I keeps it on me just in case.

01:30.699 --> 01:32.918
I'd say the trick-or-treaters
will appreciate that,

01:32.962 --> 01:34.050
but I don't see any.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.879
Did I hear you have candy?

01:38.054 --> 01:39.142
You heard right.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.579
I gots that good year-old candy.

01:41.623 --> 01:44.147
Ooh. Oh, goody.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.671
Aren't you forgetting
to say something?

01:46.715 --> 01:49.631
Oh, ja, ja.Yes.

01:49.674 --> 01:51.023
Trick and treat.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.286
It's "trick or treat."

01:52.329 --> 01:53.765
How do you not know that?

01:53.809 --> 01:55.637
And aren't you a little old
to be trick-or-treating?

01:55.680 --> 01:56.899
And why are your candy sacks

01:56.942 --> 01:59.423
shaped like the
Christmas stockings?

01:59.467 --> 02:00.685
I said trick and treat,

02:00.729 --> 02:02.687
and I mean it, you garbage kids.

02:06.082 --> 02:08.998
Those aren't trick-or-treaters!

02:09.041 --> 02:10.434
It's Santa and his elves!

02:10.478 --> 02:11.609
Code Red and White.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.481
Everyone in the car now!
Move, move!

02:19.574 --> 02:21.097
Bring me that candy!

02:25.232 --> 02:26.537
He's gaining on us!

02:26.581 --> 02:28.713
Destroy them with your
nose so bright!

02:45.121 --> 02:46.949
We're being boarded, yo!

02:46.992 --> 02:47.993
On it.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.761
Give me the candy,
you garbage children!

03:19.286 --> 03:20.896
Santa really wants that candy.

03:20.939 --> 03:23.551
I know the dude has
a sweet tooth, but dang.

03:25.379 --> 03:28.295
It's not the candy he wants,
it's the holiday itself.

03:28.338 --> 03:31.733
That's why we couldn't find any
Halloween candy or decorations.

03:31.776 --> 03:34.039
He's erased every trace
of them from town.

03:34.083 --> 03:37.869
This bag is the last remnant
of Halloween spirit.

03:37.913 --> 03:40.829
But why would Santa wish
to eradicate the Halloween?

03:40.872 --> 03:44.528
It's the only holiday that people
look forward to as much as Christmas.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.791
And Santa can't stand that.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.619
If he takes control
of Halloween,

03:48.663 --> 03:50.665
no holiday will be safe.

03:50.708 --> 03:54.495
And Christmas' influence will
stretch over the entire calendar.

04:00.849 --> 04:04.026
Why don't you come out
peacefully?

04:04.069 --> 04:08.770
Children, Santa has presents
for you.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.033
Ooh, the presents.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.428
A limited edition vinyl ofThe
Night Begins To Shine,

04:14.471 --> 04:16.168
signed by B.E.R.?

04:16.212 --> 04:17.779
Tofu?

04:17.822 --> 04:19.215
Butterbean's
Pegasus Ranch playset!

04:19.259 --> 04:22.044
A live kitten cat!

04:22.087 --> 04:23.306
No, it's a trap.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.482
But... But the kitten cat...

04:25.526 --> 04:26.962
Forget about the kitten cat!

04:28.311 --> 04:30.922
We're not falling
for it, Kringle.

04:30.966 --> 04:33.795
You might as well
head back to the North Pole.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.840
Santa will head back
to the North Pole

04:35.884 --> 04:38.321
the second you give me the bag
of Halloween candy,

04:38.365 --> 04:40.323
and I control the holiday.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.803
Never.

04:41.846 --> 04:42.934
Well, if we're going to be
here a while,

04:42.978 --> 04:44.371
why don't we all enjoy some

04:44.414 --> 04:49.289
delightful holiday music
to pass the time?

04:49.332 --> 04:52.335
Play all the Christmas carols
you want, Santa.

04:52.379 --> 04:55.338
You're not laying one
sausage finger on this candy.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.645
We'll see.

I need to get a tree.

05:15.227 --> 05:17.795
- I want to bake a ham.
- Stop him.

05:19.928 --> 05:23.540
Sorry. That music just puts me
in the Christmas spirit.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.716
We're powerless against
its influence.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.370
We can't take much more of this.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.068
Beast Boy,
call the Jolly Fat Man.

05:30.112 --> 05:32.767
Tell him we're willing
to negotiate.

05:37.293 --> 05:39.904
We said no weapons, Santa.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.253
Oh, ho-ho-ho!

05:41.297 --> 05:43.299
Santa must have forgotten.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.056
And the candy canes.

06:02.405 --> 06:04.015
Oh, have a heart.

06:04.059 --> 06:07.105
Let my hungry little elves
have their snack.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.411
Very well.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.457
Yay!

06:10.500 --> 06:13.416
Now give Santa the last bag
of Halloween candy,

06:13.460 --> 06:15.331
so we can all go home.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.767
Or should I just take it?

06:16.811 --> 06:18.160
- Try it!
- He's not worth it.

06:18.203 --> 06:19.596
Let me at him!

06:19.640 --> 06:22.033
You might wanna put a leash
on that dog of yours.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.907
What did you say, you cookies
and milk smelling oaf?

06:26.951 --> 06:28.300
Raven, take it easy.

06:28.344 --> 06:29.780
Easy.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.782
We're just talking, okay?

06:31.826 --> 06:33.349
Real calm.

06:34.568 --> 06:35.960
I'm cool.

06:36.004 --> 06:38.789
Look, Santa,
we can't give you Halloween,

06:38.833 --> 06:41.052
but we are willing
to meet you halfway.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.012
Presidents' Day.

06:45.361 --> 06:49.104
Nobody cares
about Presidents' Day.

06:49.147 --> 06:50.975
Most people don't even
get it off.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.151
Then we will sweeten the pot.

06:55.937 --> 06:58.809
Do you really think I need
those trash holidays?

06:58.853 --> 07:00.594
I only need Halloween.

07:00.637 --> 07:02.160
Once I control it,

07:02.204 --> 07:04.859
all other holidays will be
forced to bow to me.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.818
Now give Santa the candy!

07:10.517 --> 07:12.127
You said they were snacks.

07:12.170 --> 07:14.346
Never trust Santa. Elves!

07:16.174 --> 07:17.175
Run!

07:21.049 --> 07:23.051
We tried to do this peacefully.

07:23.094 --> 07:25.488
Now, we have only one option.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.229
War.

07:27.272 --> 07:29.361
But the Santa is too powerful.

07:29.405 --> 07:31.494
Remember, Halloween
is the only holiday

07:31.538 --> 07:32.974
that can rival Christmas.

07:33.017 --> 07:35.542
We just need to call on
all its strength.

07:35.585 --> 07:36.804
Raven, you're up.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.370
I'm gonna need a pumpkin
for the ritual.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.676
Will a squash work?

07:39.720 --> 07:42.113
Yeah, but where...

07:42.157 --> 07:44.376
I keeps it on me, just in case.

07:47.858 --> 07:48.990
A witch's eye.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.427
A dragon scale.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.994
A mummy's hand.

07:53.037 --> 07:54.474
A goblin's tail.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.693
And a handful of candy corn.

07:58.129 --> 07:59.261
Stop eating them.

07:59.304 --> 08:02.569
Oh, but they're so good, Mama.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.179
Yeah, they are yummy.

08:07.095 --> 08:08.139
Two candy corn.

08:15.495 --> 08:19.150
Who summons my might
on this All Hallows' Night?

08:19.194 --> 08:20.891
Oh, great Halloween spirit,

08:20.935 --> 08:23.328
we need your help
to save Halloween.

08:23.372 --> 08:24.765
Save Halloween?

08:24.808 --> 08:26.244
Whatever do you mean?

08:26.288 --> 08:29.334
Santa is trying to take over
the holiday.

08:29.378 --> 08:32.076
The Jolly Fat Man wants my day?

08:32.120 --> 08:34.514
You and I will make him pay.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.385
Scary creatures of the night,

08:36.428 --> 08:39.214
I call you forth
to help us fight!

08:51.182 --> 08:54.229
Looks like it's time to
take the fight to Santa.

08:54.272 --> 08:58.276
♪ All hail the Jolly Fat Man ♪

08:58.320 --> 08:59.756
♪ All the kids are so... ♪

08:59.800 --> 09:02.933

- Look, the garbage children.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.195
Here to give up?

09:04.239 --> 09:07.459
You are outnumbered after all.

09:07.503 --> 09:08.678
Think again.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.898
Titans, Dracula,
Wolf Man, Frankenstein

09:10.941 --> 09:12.377
and great Halloween spirit, go!

09:58.859 --> 10:01.775
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.994
Oh, looks like I've been bested,

10:04.038 --> 10:06.910
and Santa's patience
must not be tested.

10:06.954 --> 10:09.260
Better hand over
that Halloween candy,

10:09.304 --> 10:12.829
to big, fat, jolly old Santy.

10:12.873 --> 10:15.049
Fine, Santa, you win.

10:15.092 --> 10:17.747
The candy's mine.

10:17.791 --> 10:20.271
Halloween is mine.

10:20.315 --> 10:23.492
Santa wins,
you garbage children.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.977
Wait a second,
these aren't treats.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.370
- That's right.
- They're tricks.

10:36.548 --> 10:37.854
We did it, Titans.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.030
We saved Halloween from Santa.

10:42.424 --> 10:45.035
It's not too late for
Halloween Night.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.603
Let's make sure we do it right.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.007
Merry Halloween to all,

11:00.050 --> 11:02.531
and to all a scary night!
