WEBVTT

00:16.934 --> 00:19.520
Holy shit.
Do you know what we could do with this?

00:19.520 --> 00:22.439
Yeah. I'm gonna get my house.

00:27.986 --> 00:31.865
Hey, this soul-retrieval shit is fun.
Admit it.

00:31.865 --> 00:35.160
Yeah. You wanna see fun?

00:35.160 --> 00:36.870
<i>It's Stewart. Leave a message.</i>

00:36.870 --> 00:39.164
Hi, Stewart. It's your big sister.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.166
The one who taught you
how to tie your shoes,

00:41.166 --> 00:43.669
- ride your bike and gave you everything.
- Ride your bike. Yeah.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.255
I just want you to know
that you're gonna be getting

00:46.255 --> 00:48.340
the next two months' rent up-front.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.883
So don't worry about it, okay?

00:50.467 --> 00:51.301
Okay.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.306
Peg, are you feeling it?

00:58.809 --> 01:00.477
I'm getting a lot of memories here.

01:00.477 --> 01:03.689
Like the time you gave my phone number
to the Colombian cartel,

01:03.689 --> 01:08.610
and I had to hide out in the bathroom
of the gas station down the street? Yeah.

01:08.610 --> 01:12.781
You know, Peg, I choose to focus on
the good times, not the bad.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.116
- It's just a choice.
- Okay.

01:15.534 --> 01:18.161
- Garage. All right. Let's go.
- Oh, fuck.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.498
- Denny, help me. This is heavy. Here.
- Come on.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.585
Oh, fuck, Denny!

01:24.585 --> 01:26.879
It was your last night, and I get that.

01:26.879 --> 01:30.883
I'm just not gonna listen to you anymore,
because I get...

01:30.883 --> 01:33.260
All right. Whatever. I'll start...

01:38.891 --> 01:39.892
Okay.

01:44.563 --> 01:45.564
Fuck.

01:46.523 --> 01:47.524
Okay, come on.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.406
Thattagirl.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.330
We still got it, babe.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.540
There's no "we."

02:11.548 --> 02:13.217
- What a douche.
- Don't.

02:13.217 --> 02:15.344
The guy cheated us. I tried signaling you.

02:15.344 --> 02:18.639
No way the nickel content
can be as high as he said it was.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.600
- He tested it right in front of us.
- The test was bullshit.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.311
Why would I imagine
this would go any other way?

02:24.311 --> 02:28.273
Only outta your mouth
does 25,000 mean five grand.

02:28.273 --> 02:32.027
Yeah, well, I could've gotten more,
but you didn't work with me in there.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.863
And you dropped half of it at the house.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.031
Okay?

02:36.031 --> 02:37.533
Get in the fucking car!

03:13.110 --> 03:15.445
All right,
I'm just dragging these drives over here.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.156
Have you ever backed any of these up?

03:18.657 --> 03:19.825
As in?

03:21.660 --> 03:24.788
- It's like the fucking NSA in here.
- Don't talk to him.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.295
He is in the zone!

03:31.295 --> 03:32.796
Where'd you find that kid?

03:32.796 --> 03:34.089
The supermarket.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.926
- He said you're both friends of Bill.
- Bill's the manager.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.721
Okay. This is for you.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.848
It's not much, but it'll buy us some time.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.267
And by the way,
it brings me no joy doing this.

03:45.267 --> 03:46.977
It's actually physically painful.

03:46.977 --> 03:50.522
My mortgage is gonna be a heavy lift,
but I can deal with that.

03:50.522 --> 03:53.483
What I can't deal with
is having no future. I need a life.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.110
We gotta keep the lights on here.

03:58.405 --> 04:02.659
I feel like my organs are
actually rejecting this.

04:03.285 --> 04:06.705
Oh, God. I want you to take it.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.209
Does a part of me wish you would say no?

04:10.209 --> 04:12.628
Well, yes. Every part.

04:12.628 --> 04:17.507
I mean, there's no part of me
that wants you to take it, but you must.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.091
You must.

04:23.639 --> 04:24.640
The fuck is happening?

04:26.517 --> 04:28.769
- I'm sorry.
- It's upsetting.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.729
It's so goddamn touching!

04:30.729 --> 04:34.149
Just think of it as a loan, okay?
Ten percent interest.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.609
Ten percent?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.986
Eight. I'll give you an introductory rate.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.244
I gotta handle my situation.

04:45.244 --> 04:47.871
This is just a drop in the bucket.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.998
That was touching.

04:49.998 --> 04:54.461
Thank you for having my back.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.380
Going, going, gone.

04:56.380 --> 05:00.926
Okay. Hey, don't forget about
that meeting in Pioneertown tonight.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.928
That's a real piece of business.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.388
Wait, you were serious about that?

05:04.388 --> 05:06.473
Yes, it's all coming together.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.977
I am this close
to this Dona Scarborough reward.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.564
I am 98.6% sure that she's dead.

05:13.564 --> 05:17.693
She left behind her balding bird,
who is also her soulmate.

05:18.569 --> 05:21.071
Never mind.
Look, I know what I'm doing, okay?

05:21.071 --> 05:23.740
Okay, listen,
I have an assignment for you.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.826
It's an actual case.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.496
Cheating spouse, potentially.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.124
We're still fishing, so no rough stuff.

05:32.124 --> 05:35.252
Follow her.
Take pictures if you see anything.

05:35.752 --> 05:36.753
Yeah.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.175
Actually, I don't know how I feel about

05:41.675 --> 05:44.511
interfering with
another woman's pursuit of love.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.806
- Plus, I'm busy.
- I hope you're fucking kidding.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.600
I mean, who are we to know

05:49.600 --> 05:55.731
that this woman who wears mock turtlenecks
hasn't finally found love?

05:55.731 --> 05:57.024
I mean, who am I to--

05:57.649 --> 05:59.568
Is she wearing suspenders?

06:01.028 --> 06:03.488
Okay, fine. I'm a professional.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.199
That's her work address.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.283
I'm on it.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.119
No rough stuff.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.122
Okay, sometimes it sticks
going into third. Just keep grinding it.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.624
- It'll go to fourth.
- Okay, great.

06:13.624 --> 06:16.793
Except if you hear a high, wheezing sound,
drop it back to second.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.837
- Got it.
- Hey, thanks for the car.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.839
I'll be careful.
Unless I'm being followed.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.007
Totally.

06:22.508 --> 06:26.470
Listen, I don't like
that you're doing this with Denny.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.765
Next thing you know,
you'll be sleeping together.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.394
No. You already did?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.438
I'm a woman, Carol. I have needs.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.233
But never again. I hate him.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.027
So what's this assignment you have for me?

06:42.027 --> 06:43.820
Just a little surveillance.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.365
Somebody's wife. Probable cheater.
Just fish around.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.825
- No rough stuff.
- Why would I rough her up?

06:48.825 --> 06:50.661
Well, you never know how things will turn.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.079
Keep your knees bent.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.333
What's up with her?

06:57.543 --> 07:01.046
Grounded and 15, and her drone.

07:01.046 --> 07:04.007
And standing in a lame fake Western town
with you.

07:04.007 --> 07:07.803
Hey, you know what my stepmother was like?

07:07.803 --> 07:11.306
Mussolini with a bad perm and a nose job.

07:11.306 --> 07:15.686
She told me I was fat and threw
my birthday cake in the disposal.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.437
Carol's sweet.

07:17.437 --> 07:21.400
Look, she's not your mom,
but she's not trying to be.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.528
She's not a bitch either.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.530
So just pay her some respect.

07:27.531 --> 07:28.866
I'm so bored right now.

07:28.866 --> 07:32.202
Welcome to Earth. It's boring.

07:32.202 --> 07:37.332
You're the one that can't be boring.
You need to be a comet, okay?

07:38.083 --> 07:39.209
Yeah, whatever.

07:39.209 --> 07:43.130
Okay. Kick some ass, comet style.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.609
You gotta cover the tattoos.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.738
Don't worry about it.
Even grandmas get tattoos now.

08:07.738 --> 08:11.241
Not spiders. Not on their necks.
Tighten it up.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.076
Okay.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.706
Are you wearing spy glasses?

08:18.207 --> 08:20.292
You only know they're fake
'cause I don't wear glasses.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.336
You look like a beautiful Henry Kissinger.

08:23.587 --> 08:24.713
Judy can't come.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.381
She's coming. Take 'em off.

08:26.381 --> 08:29.468
I need 'em. They got a mic in 'em.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.721
- I gotta prove what he did.
- These fucking things.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.182
They look ridiculous. Come on.

08:35.849 --> 08:39.602
Denny! Why do you destroy everything?
Why is that your first instinct?

08:39.602 --> 08:41.813
- There we go.
- I have no words.

08:42.606 --> 08:45.400
This is smarter. Nobody bugs dogs.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.860
Come here, Judy.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.196
There you go.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.573
Look at this.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.826
Judy's gonna record everything,
starting now,

08:54.826 --> 08:56.537
and he'll have no idea.

08:58.497 --> 08:59.581
All right.

08:59.581 --> 09:03.335
Just don't let the dog distract you.
You'll miss my cue.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.004
- You're cuing me?
- Yeah.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.174
Hey, I invented Miami Shock and Awe.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.801
- Come here.
- I don't wanna talk about this now.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.053
- We're gonna be late.
- There you go. Good girl.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.181
- Come on, Judy. There you go.
- Come on, Judy. Watch your mic. Here.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.392
Yeah, hi. Get in.

09:45.711 --> 09:49.047
Just remember,
Miami Shock and Awe was all me.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.341
Where do you think the name came from?

09:51.341 --> 09:54.887
And who got the money
from Alfredo in Miami? Me!

09:56.680 --> 09:59.683
What's with this?
Who are you trying to impress?

09:59.683 --> 10:02.561
Simmer down and wait for my fucking cue.

10:05.022 --> 10:08.317
Bob! This is Mr. Dennis.
He works for Kachel.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.574
Do you mind if I pat you down?

10:19.286 --> 10:21.914
I don't know
what you've been told about me, my friend,

10:21.914 --> 10:25.042
but I'm an art consultant.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.710
Why would I carry a gun?

10:26.710 --> 10:28.795
Let's just keep it classy, okay?

10:28.795 --> 10:32.633
Listen, I'm sorry,
but that's what we're doing here.

10:42.142 --> 10:46.355
You know, I'm authorized to spend
a great deal of money here today, sir.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.027
Now me?

10:55.864 --> 10:59.326
Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna pat you down, okay?

11:02.371 --> 11:03.872
Okay, right here.

11:03.872 --> 11:07.042
- I wasn't done.
- You shave your legs.

11:07.042 --> 11:10.462
All right. Okay, enou-- That's enough.

11:10.462 --> 11:12.047
- All right, okay.
- Okay.

11:12.047 --> 11:13.298
Okay.

11:13.298 --> 11:16.635
Well, while we're at it,
why don't we pat the dog down too?

11:21.056 --> 11:22.391
Be my guest.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.271
Pat the dog down.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.233
- Good one.
- Come on in.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.943
- Okay.
- Hey.

11:33.819 --> 11:36.071
What the hell?
Is something going on with you two?

11:45.414 --> 11:46.748
He's got a great eye.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.293
He does all of Kachel's buying
for North America.

11:52.421 --> 11:53.505
The colors.

11:54.590 --> 11:57.092
It's the brushstrokes that get me.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.428
Yeah,
that's fairly typical for impressionism.

11:59.428 --> 12:00.721
Actually, it's not typical.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.806
He uses constructive strokes,

12:02.806 --> 12:05.851
which is more representative
of post-impressionism,

12:05.851 --> 12:06.935
which is what this is.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.855
Really? We're doing this?

12:09.855 --> 12:12.858
I have a call, so if we could just...

12:14.026 --> 12:15.027
Okay.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.614
To be clear, this work,

12:20.032 --> 12:21.158
this is a fake.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.788
No. No.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.709
No. I mean, no.

12:30.709 --> 12:33.504
Just relax. Hey, he doesn't care.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.341
Do you know how many fakes there are
in the Metropolitan Museum?

12:37.925 --> 12:39.551
Exactly. Neither do they.

12:39.551 --> 12:42.471
No, I mean, it is stolen.

12:43.096 --> 12:47.809
- But it is now on my wall and it's--
- Bob, it's a fake.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.811
It's okay. We know.

12:49.811 --> 12:53.148
But it's some of the most incredible work
I've ever seen.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.651
I mean, half of the art world is fakes.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.656
You wanna tell me who did this?

13:00.656 --> 13:04.326
- Do you mind if the dog waits outside?
- No, she's house-trained.

13:04.326 --> 13:07.412
Look, we're on a roll here.
Who's the artist?

13:07.412 --> 13:08.580
You know, I have another buyer.

13:08.580 --> 13:12.167
You know, I think Kachel's gonna
fucking love this, even if it is a fake.

13:12.167 --> 13:15.921
I could let it go for a million in cash
by Friday.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.051
Okay. Done.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.177
Hey.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.555
Now, tell me who the forger is.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.061
Could you take the dog out?

13:31.061 --> 13:32.729
Yeah, could you take the dog out?

13:35.315 --> 13:37.568
We're talking here. Can you?

13:41.905 --> 13:43.323
Come. Judy, come.

13:44.116 --> 13:46.910
You know, Peggy,
she's real cute and everything,

13:46.910 --> 13:49.121
but she's a handful.

13:49.121 --> 13:51.790
She's got her issues,
but she's got a good heart.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.834
We used to date in New York

13:53.834 --> 13:57.421
back when she was dealing
massive amounts of pot...

13:57.421 --> 13:59.882
Hey, hey. This isn't a talk show.

13:59.882 --> 14:03.218
Yeah. Right, I'll call Kachel tonight.

14:03.218 --> 14:06.555
What time is it in Florence?
I'm gonna need to take a picture.

14:06.555 --> 14:08.849
No. No pictures. I'll send you a catalog.

14:08.849 --> 14:09.933
Why do you need to call?

14:09.933 --> 14:11.935
I thought you were authorized.
I need the money by Friday.

14:11.935 --> 14:15.314
I heard you the first time, champ.
Friday it is.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.860
- Great. You want a beer?
- Yes.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.069
Make yourselves at home.

14:29.328 --> 14:30.329
Thank you.

14:32.331 --> 14:35.083
I'd like to know more about the artist.

14:37.169 --> 14:38.170
She was my wife.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.630
So she's dead?

14:39.630 --> 14:41.298
No, she left me.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.217
- By dying?
- No.

14:43.217 --> 14:45.552
- 'Cause you're using past tense.
- No.

14:45.552 --> 14:49.306
Look, Kachel's buying,
but he does his research.

14:50.599 --> 14:52.809
Your wife's family put up a reward.

14:52.809 --> 14:56.688
And she was forging art.
This is deep, Bobby.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.440
Bob or Robert.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.526
Yeah, right.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.445
This has nothing to do
with the art, though.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.614
They just wanted to find her.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.616
How does this concern the sale?

15:07.616 --> 15:10.702
Should we get the dog back in here? Judy!

15:12.204 --> 15:14.414
Come, girl. Come!

15:14.414 --> 15:18.210
Look, I'm just saying--
And by the way, I wish her well.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.921
But if she's dead,
the work's gonna be more valuable.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.467
I don't think
that forgeries appreciate that way.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.469
Well, that's how stupid the art world is.

15:27.469 --> 15:30.347
We just need a little knowledge
for marketing, really.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.854
There was this incident...

15:39.273 --> 15:40.691
at a taco truck.

15:42.568 --> 15:45.487
<i>A guy I worked with
was having personal problems.</i>

15:47.447 --> 15:52.077
<i>And in my hectic
nose-to-the-grindstone haze, I missed it.</i>

15:52.077 --> 15:54.997
Hey, bubbles. How's things in clipboard?

15:57.749 --> 16:02.212
You know, would it kill you
to smile every once in a while?

16:02.212 --> 16:03.589
You know what I mean?

16:08.218 --> 16:11.305
<i>Now, in my defense,
I hadn't eaten all day.</i>

16:12.055 --> 16:13.682
Is this the line?

16:16.727 --> 16:18.020
You're Bob Scarborough.

16:19.313 --> 16:22.983
Do you mind if I cut in front of you?
I'm pregnant, and I have got to eat.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.278
You're not that pregnant.

16:28.739 --> 16:29.865
- I'm sorry?
- Okay.

16:30.616 --> 16:32.826
No, you cannot cut in front of me.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.579
- I'm sorry.
- I am pregnant, and I have to eat.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.122
We all got to eat.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.041
- I'm having a child.
- I know what pregnant means.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.375
Look, he's right up there.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.794
- Oh, my God!
- No, don't do it!

16:55.390 --> 16:59.144
<i>Maybe if you've been in combat,
you're prepared for this kind of trauma,</i>

16:59.144 --> 17:01.438
<i>but I had no defenses.</i>

17:12.699 --> 17:13.951
Scarborough, you okay?

17:15.160 --> 17:16.161
Scarborough?

17:19.164 --> 17:23.167
<i>I spiraled into
a kind of existential tailspin.</i>

17:32.761 --> 17:36.682
<i>I needed some time off.
Honestly, I couldn't function.</i>

17:40.477 --> 17:41.603
Hello.

17:41.603 --> 17:44.398
<i>And Dona didn't help. She really didn't.</i>

17:44.398 --> 17:47.484
But a leave of absence doesn't mean
you become a hobo.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.321
It's sad what happened. It's unfortunate.

17:52.865 --> 17:54.283
I think when his glasses--

17:54.283 --> 17:56.869
Oh, my God.
Yes. Maybe you could have been nicer.

17:56.869 --> 17:58.954
- Maybe you could have said hello.
- Hello.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.581
- I said hello.
- Whatever.

18:01.874 --> 18:03.333
I called him "bubbles."

18:03.333 --> 18:04.960
Okay. Well, then you were friendly.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.254
I was snide.

18:08.839 --> 18:12.009
Well, you live, you learn, babe.
Who is the sweetest bird?

18:12.009 --> 18:13.510
And then he was dead.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.680
- And then he was dead.
- Okay, you know what, Bob?

18:16.680 --> 18:19.016
You probably said hello
to a lot of people who are dead. Okay?

18:19.016 --> 18:20.017
Hello.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.685
This has been going on too long.

18:21.685 --> 18:24.021
Either you go back to work,
or you get a shrink.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.440
I can't even paint with this shit.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.573
<i>So, I sought help from a psychiatrist</i>

18:34.573 --> 18:36.366
<i>who helps trauma victims</i>

18:36.366 --> 18:39.536
<i>by guiding them
through hallucinogenic sessions.</i>

18:47.878 --> 18:52.257
<i>It changed my life.
It changed my whole perspective.</i>

18:56.386 --> 18:58.096
<i>Like, radically.</i>

19:09.983 --> 19:10.984
Bob.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.570
They need you at the studio.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.575
Welcome back.
We are following breaking news right now.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.285
Let's take you to downtown Palm Springs.

19:20.285 --> 19:23.080
That is where
a massive sinkhole has collapsed,

19:23.080 --> 19:24.706
swallowing a tourist.

19:24.706 --> 19:27.584
Alicia Hererra is on the ground.
She has all of the late-breaking details.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.503
Alicia, what can you tell us
about this tragedy?

19:29.503 --> 19:32.089
Ho-Hold on a second.

19:32.089 --> 19:37.010
Is this a tragedy? Does it even matter?

19:37.010 --> 19:40.639
I mean, it's just death.
That's where we're all headed.

19:40.639 --> 19:42.432
- What's he doing?
- What the hell's he doing?

19:42.432 --> 19:47.062
'Cause everything else,
all of this, is stupid.

19:47.062 --> 19:49.898
<i>Dona didn't really get it.</i>

19:49.898 --> 19:51.859
So, I got fired.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.069
Yeah, I saw.

19:54.069 --> 19:57.239
Let's open the champagne.
I can do something meaningful now.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.616
And what's that, Bob?
You gonna trip balls professionally?

20:00.367 --> 20:01.702
It gives me perspective.

20:16.550 --> 20:20.012
<i>The next six months
had a pretty deep effect.</i>

20:20.012 --> 20:21.763
<i>My perspective sharpened.</i>

20:22.848 --> 20:28.020
<i>My televised epiphany
seemed to send people to my door.</i>

20:28.979 --> 20:32.024
<i>I gave them hope, I think.</i>

20:32.024 --> 20:33.775
Everything is stupid.

20:33.775 --> 20:37.613
Guru Bob, is psychic pain stupid?

20:40.741 --> 20:42.284
Everything's stupid.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.953
I need some coffee.

20:45.704 --> 20:49.124
- Everything is stupid.
- Thank you.

21:05.474 --> 21:06.683
<i>I had changed.</i>

21:11.605 --> 21:13.732
<i>And she hadn't.</i>

21:19.279 --> 21:20.781
<i>It's sad, isn't it?</i>

21:20.781 --> 21:24.868
<i>You hear it all the time.
Couples grow apart.</i>

21:26.620 --> 21:29.790
Ultimately, my wife was a prisoner
of a two-dimensional perspective.

21:29.790 --> 21:30.707
Yeah.

21:30.707 --> 21:32.501
One time,
she was screaming at me like a banshee...

21:32.501 --> 21:33.585
Hey, man.

21:33.585 --> 21:37.798
Hey, if you ever need to talk,
I'm opening a qigong studio.

21:37.798 --> 21:39.466
Safe space. Men only.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.510
He's talking now, Denny.

21:42.386 --> 21:44.429
Okay, go on. One time what?

21:44.429 --> 21:47.850
The journey of the self,
through the self, to the self?

21:49.017 --> 21:50.894
I could use some investors, you know.

21:51.687 --> 21:52.855
I don't see the dog anymore.

21:52.855 --> 21:55.941
Are you thinking, like,
Guru Bob's Qigong, or--

21:55.941 --> 21:58.360
- We got to find the dog.
- Silent partner.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.528
I have a following.

21:59.528 --> 22:00.946
I'll give you a call.

22:01.446 --> 22:03.282
Judy!

22:04.491 --> 22:05.492
Judy!

22:06.493 --> 22:08.161
Come on, girl. Judy!

22:09.371 --> 22:13.292
- Judy! Come here, girl. Come on, girl.
- Hey, hey! Good girl. Come on.

22:13.292 --> 22:16.170
- Come on, Judy.
- Come on, girl. Good girl.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.213
Come on, sweetie.

22:21.967 --> 22:23.802
- Come here, girl.
- Hey, what's she got in her mouth?

22:23.802 --> 22:26.972
Drop it. Judy, drop it.

22:26.972 --> 22:29.683
Whatever it is, she swallowed it.
Let's go.

22:30.893 --> 22:32.644
<i>Are you working for the other side?</i>

22:32.644 --> 22:35.147
It's insane what you just did in there.

22:35.147 --> 22:40.694
I was at the crest. It's go time.
And you decide this is the moment for you

22:40.694 --> 22:44.198
to chisel out seed money
for your pretend qigong studio.

22:44.198 --> 22:46.283
Peg, it was an opportunity.

22:47.284 --> 22:49.494
Is this another one
of your choices, Denny?

22:50.245 --> 22:53.999
Don't ever talk to me again. Ever.

22:54.583 --> 22:56.001
Really? We're gonna do this?

22:57.544 --> 22:59.713
You okay, girl? Look at you. You okay?

22:59.713 --> 23:00.964
<i>I had one shot.</i>

23:01.882 --> 23:04.218
I had him on the hook,
you took him right off.

23:04.218 --> 23:07.387
- That's not-- Okay. All right.
- No, do not talk. Okay?

23:07.387 --> 23:09.765
Now I got to find another way to nail him

23:09.765 --> 23:13.393
and to neutralize
this father-daughter fucking hit team

23:13.393 --> 23:14.937
long enough to get a reward.

23:14.937 --> 23:19.775
'Cause there's no way
that Dona left a bald fucking bird.

23:21.276 --> 23:23.153
I don't know
how you're gonna pull this off.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.572
So this is your new move?

23:25.572 --> 23:28.867
- Okay.
- First, you just crash the whole plan.

23:28.867 --> 23:31.787
And now you're trying to wear down
my confidence.

23:31.787 --> 23:34.081
Why don't you call Kachel?
Maybe he can help you.

23:34.081 --> 23:35.832
I thought you don't say his name.

23:35.832 --> 23:38.210
- I don't say his name.
- Well, you just said his name.

23:38.210 --> 23:42.756
- I can't stand the fucking guy. Come on.
- 'Cause he's everything you wanna be.

23:42.756 --> 23:46.093
Really? I wanna be a douchebag
who treats you like shit?

23:46.093 --> 23:50.430
Okay, no. I'm trying to build a life here.
I don't need you to fuck it all up.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.515
Yeah.

23:52.349 --> 23:54.977
I know for a fact
that you're upsetting her.

23:55.644 --> 23:56.687
I got to get her to a vet.

23:56.687 --> 23:59.898
You can't afford a vet. Come here, Judy.

24:01.233 --> 24:02.359
Oh, God.

24:02.359 --> 24:04.194
That feels better. Right, girl?

24:06.113 --> 24:07.489
Hey, what the fuck is that?

24:10.200 --> 24:13.537
It's a finger. Oh, God!

24:18.625 --> 24:19.626
Good girl.
