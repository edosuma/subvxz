00:02.869 --> 00:07.033
<i>- Does everybody know what time it is?
- Tool Time!</i>

00:07.140 --> 00:12.601
That's right! Binford Tools is proud
to present Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

00:12.679 --> 00:14.647
Whoo!

00:18.985 --> 00:21.749
Hey. Wow.

00:27.894 --> 00:30.454
<i>I am Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.
Welcome to Tool Time.</i>

00:30.563 --> 00:33.054
Of course, you all
know my assistant, Al Borland.

00:35.635 --> 00:36.693
Thank you.

00:38.805 --> 00:42.366
This year we're kicking off Halloween
week with a very special event:

00:42.475 --> 00:44.636
- Pumpkin racing.
- All right!

00:47.013 --> 00:48.571
That's right.
On this very ramp,

00:48.681 --> 00:51.411
Al and I will be racing our
pumpkins in the first annual

00:51.484 --> 00:53.509
<i>Tool Time Gourd-O-Rama.</i>

00:57.157 --> 01:01.184
- Well? We all ready?
- I was born ready.

01:01.261 --> 01:03.957
Interesting.

01:04.030 --> 01:06.260
Let's compare our pumpkin-mobiles.

01:06.332 --> 01:09.028
- Here you are, Tim.
- OK.

01:09.102 --> 01:11.195
Well, mine first!

01:11.271 --> 01:15.207
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

01:17.944 --> 01:21.107
Well, I built my Borland beauty
according to the rules set down

01:21.181 --> 01:25.345
by the Pumpkin-Racing Council
of Manattan Beach, California.

01:25.418 --> 01:30.117
It runs on independent axles
and it is powered entirely by gravity.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.852
And nobody knows
more about gravity than Al.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.155
Let's take a...

01:38.231 --> 01:40.563
Let's take a look at this bad boy. Yeah.

01:42.168 --> 01:45.535
This is a graphite tube frame,
independent suspension.

01:45.605 --> 01:49.302
And under the hood, a two-cycle,
ethanol-powered chain saw motor.

01:56.816 --> 02:00.183
Excuse me, Tim, but according
to the pumpkin-racing bylaws,

02:00.253 --> 02:06.214
section one, paragraph one,
word one, "No engines allowed."

02:08.495 --> 02:12.022
Well, sure you can joke. But for
seven years you've been putting

02:12.098 --> 02:14.157
an engine in everything
you can think of,

02:14.234 --> 02:16.327
and then you have an unfair advantage.

02:16.402 --> 02:21.169
All right, tell you what.
How about I give you a head start?

02:21.241 --> 02:22.572
Great!

02:25.044 --> 02:26.409
Al?

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:39.359 --> 02:43.125
- Nice advantage.
- Gentlemen, start your pumpkins.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.935
I win!

03:47.126 --> 03:50.220
Cool. Yeah.
All right, I'll be there. Bye.

03:50.430 --> 03:51.397
Who was that?

03:51.497 --> 03:54.330
One guy on the team's having
people over for Halloween.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.631
- He wanted to tell me what to bring.
- I don't think that Mark

03:57.704 --> 04:01.470
has any plans on Halloween.
Could you take him along with you?

04:01.541 --> 04:04.840
Mom, I'm supposed
to bring the chips, not the dip.

04:06.546 --> 04:09.709
What about you and Lauren?
You're going to a costume party.

04:09.782 --> 04:13.548
Yeah. We're going as the scariest people
we could think of: Republicans.

04:15.455 --> 04:18.185
Why don't you take Mark along?

04:18.257 --> 04:20.123
That's a little too scary.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.688
- Hi, Randy.
- Hi, sweetie.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.729
How are you?

04:23.830 --> 04:26.128
I heard that Al creamed you
in the pumpkin race.

04:26.199 --> 04:30.693
You know, that's the trouble
with Halloween in this country.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.931
There's too much emphasis on winning.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.874
I'm worried about Mark spending
Halloween alone in the house here.

04:38.978 --> 04:43.312
Or worse, with that
weird new friend of his, Ronny.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.749
He's been moping
around the house a lot lately.

04:45.818 --> 04:48.719
When I was his age,
I was always doing productive stuff.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.916
Whether it was
reading car magazines or...

04:55.361 --> 04:57.522
That was really all that I ever did.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.626
- Hey.
- Hey, Mark.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.065
Oh, hi.

05:04.404 --> 05:06.531
Hey, Ronny!

05:10.877 --> 05:13.038
Just back from glee club?

05:15.181 --> 05:17.877
- I need to borrow the video camera.
- What for?

05:17.950 --> 05:21.113
Well, Ronny and I are in
a film class and we're making a movie.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.518
- A movie?
- Wait, wait. Let me guess.

05:23.589 --> 05:27.081
A fun-filled romp with some
musical interlude numbers.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.856
Fred Astaire and Ethel Mertz.

05:32.298 --> 05:34.926
- It's a horror film.
- That sounds really cool.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.970
- I was hoping the family'd be in it.
- Yeah, that sounds good.

05:38.037 --> 05:40.699
Gosh! I haven't acted since high school.

05:40.773 --> 05:43.298
'Course, that was just
a couple of years ago.

05:45.144 --> 05:47.009
That was a joke.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.446
Good one.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.345
Come on, Ronny.
Let's go work on the script.

05:56.389 --> 05:58.152
Nice talking to you, Ronny.

06:03.763 --> 06:08.097
Well, it was encouraging. I mean,
he's finally interested in something.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.727
And it's gonna include
the whole family. It's good.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.293
- Little problem.
- What?

06:12.372 --> 06:15.535
- My contract demands.
- Which would be?

06:15.641 --> 06:18.804
I don't work cheap.
I do not do nude scenes.

06:18.911 --> 06:23.007
Unless it's integral to the plot.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.816
- Ready?
- Yeah. Uh, wait. Yeah.

06:28.921 --> 06:31.651
OK, we're rolling.

06:31.724 --> 06:35.216
Halloween film, take three.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.755
And action!

06:43.569 --> 06:46.094
<i>Hi, honey. I'm home.</i>

06:47.206 --> 06:49.834
<i>Hi, sweetie.</i>

06:49.909 --> 06:52.639
How was your day at the office, Jim?

06:54.881 --> 06:57.042
Peachy, Lil.

06:57.116 --> 07:00.950
Say, I got the Dithers account.

07:01.020 --> 07:05.252
<i>Which means that
washerldryer combo is all yours.</i>

07:06.526 --> 07:08.653
What a fella!

07:08.728 --> 07:11.697
Now we can be the family
of tomorrow today.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.765
Look, it's our two sons,
Chad and Andy.

07:15.835 --> 07:18.929
Hey, great news, Mom and Pop!

07:19.005 --> 07:22.133
As you know, I'm very athletic.
And today, as always,

07:22.208 --> 07:24.768
I scored the winning touchdown.

07:24.844 --> 07:28.473
- Crackerjack, son!
- That's wonderful! Have a cookie!

07:28.548 --> 07:30.778
- Thank you.
- And how was your day, Andy?

07:30.850 --> 07:34.581
Dandy!
I've been accepted into Harvard

07:34.654 --> 07:37.316
and every other college
in the western hemisphere.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.654
That's wonderful!

07:41.093 --> 07:42.924
Have a cookie.

07:42.995 --> 07:46.055
We certainly are blessed
to have two such smart children.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.430
No, Father.
It is we who are blessed.

07:48.501 --> 07:52.665
- Because we have such great parents.
- Ah!

07:54.440 --> 07:56.465
- And cut.
- Ew.

07:56.542 --> 08:00.171
Honey, are you sure
you want it that exaggerated?

08:00.246 --> 08:01.770
It was perfect. Come on, Ronny.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.715
Let's go out in the backyard
for the next scene.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.176
I thought this was
supposed to be a horror film.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.812
- It's just one scene.
- Yeah.

08:09.922 --> 08:12.891
For all we know, this may be
a piece of cinema history.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.927
Oh, it's a piece of something.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.954
Come on. We're doing this
to help Mark out. And you know what?

08:20.032 --> 08:23.729
Just for starting out,
I think it's a pretty damn good movie.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.634
Not surprising. Your favorite film

08:25.705 --> 08:28.572
<i>is Abbott and Costello
Meet Frankenstein.</i>

08:28.641 --> 08:32.407
Hey, that movie was important!
It was about relationships.

08:34.313 --> 08:38.078
If this movie is bad,
Mark is just gonna be devastated.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.243
He's gonna go back
to moping all the time.

08:40.318 --> 08:44.483
Jill, you're jumping the gun.
This movie, it's bound to get better.

08:44.590 --> 08:47.821
It could just be that it just
starts out with the happy family.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.658
- Yeah, yeah.
- Once you get to know and love us,

08:50.763 --> 08:52.628
we get terrorized by cannibals...

08:52.698 --> 08:54.666
- Perfect! Yeah!
...who rip up our flesh

08:54.767 --> 08:56.530
- and eat us alive!
- Yeah!

08:56.602 --> 08:58.763
A love story! I like it!

09:00.473 --> 09:02.532
Let me in!

09:03.409 --> 09:05.377
Let me in!

09:07.580 --> 09:09.741
Let me in!

09:16.522 --> 09:18.888
Your face is all smushed!

09:18.991 --> 09:21.926
You could drive
a truck up that nostril!

09:22.695 --> 09:24.856
These things are great!

09:24.931 --> 09:27.399
Well, hidy-ho, Taylor-teers.

09:27.466 --> 09:30.026
Whoa! Cool do, Wilson.

09:30.136 --> 09:32.900
So aerodynamic.

09:33.005 --> 09:36.668
Actually, I'm dressed as a mad scientist
for my scene in Mark's movie.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.972
You know,
he's a very talented director.

09:39.045 --> 09:41.570
- Do you really think so?
- Uh-huh. He was very clear.

09:41.647 --> 09:44.548
He knew exactly what he wanted.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.585
I think it's gonna be
an excellent movie.

09:46.686 --> 09:49.120
- What's the movie about?
- I have no idea.

09:50.022 --> 09:54.049
Neither do we. I just hope it's good
and he gets a positive response.

09:54.126 --> 09:56.287
Yeah. Then maybe
he'll come out of his shell

09:56.395 --> 09:58.454
and feel more comfortable socially.

09:59.699 --> 10:03.863
Well, the teen years are difficult, but
we always manage to get through them.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.996
You know, when I was
Mark's age, my parents thought

10:07.073 --> 10:09.735
that I was an odd duck.
And look at me now.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.981
- Well, I finished.
- What did you do to it?

10:18.084 --> 10:21.178
I modified it
for my rematch with Al.

10:21.253 --> 10:24.745
This is the only gourd in the city
with an anti-sway bar on it.

10:25.725 --> 10:28.853
I thought modifying was how you
got in trouble in the first place.

10:28.928 --> 10:32.887
I don't think so. I think
it's how Al built that track.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.933
<i>Come take a look
at old Tool Times with me,</i>

10:35.034 --> 10:38.197
and we'll look at that episode
in slow motion.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.830
This is a classic library, honey.

10:40.940 --> 10:44.637
- "Repairing a Gas Heater."
- Or how to blow up a house.

10:44.710 --> 10:48.407
Yeah. Oh, wow! "Veneering a Table."

10:48.481 --> 10:51.746
How to glue a board to your head.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.379
"Suburban House of Horrors"?

10:56.455 --> 11:00.619
Where you burned down the garage
or filled the basement with sewage?

11:00.726 --> 11:03.889
- This is Mark's movie.
- Ooh!

11:03.996 --> 11:06.760
- Where is he?
- He's asleep.

11:06.832 --> 11:07.799
Really?

11:07.900 --> 11:10.767
Too bad we promised him
we wouldn't look at it.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.861
We could make sure
he's on the right track.

11:12.938 --> 11:14.769
Get a better feel for our characters.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.206
For better performances
in future scenes.

11:17.276 --> 11:19.767
- We made a promise.
- We always keep our promises.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.278
- Do we?
- Not always.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.507
I didn't think so.

11:27.720 --> 11:32.783
<i>Hi, honey. I'm home.</i>

11:32.858 --> 11:35.019
<i>Hi, sweetie.</i>

11:35.094 --> 11:37.654
It's black and white.
I look good in black and white.

11:37.763 --> 11:40.823
Unfortunately, I have
to live with you in color.

11:42.034 --> 11:46.801
<i>Perfect parents.
The perfect sons. The perfect family.</i>

11:46.872 --> 11:49.432
<i>Except for
the family member they ignore.</i>

11:49.542 --> 11:53.876
<i>The outcast, the forgotten son, Clark.</i>

11:53.946 --> 11:58.440
<i>But Clark's got a plan.
And when he's done, they'll be sorry.</i>

11:58.517 --> 12:00.382
<i>Very sorry.</i>

12:11.964 --> 12:14.933
Who's Clark?

12:25.544 --> 12:29.105
<i>Hello, Dr. Wilsonstein.
I need a potion.</i>

12:29.215 --> 12:32.378
<i>What is your pleasure, Clark?</i>

12:32.451 --> 12:37.115
<i>I need something that'll make my family
look as weird as they think I am.</i>

12:38.858 --> 12:42.760
<i>The Number Six.
Selling like hotcakes today.</i>

12:45.698 --> 12:51.330
<i>You rang, Dr. Wilsonstein?</i>

12:52.271 --> 12:57.504
<i>- Who's that?
- That is my assistant, Algore.</i>

12:59.311 --> 13:02.007
<i>He assists me.</i>

13:03.149 --> 13:05.310
<i>Algore,</i>

13:05.384 --> 13:09.684
<i>I need four of my
special face-distorting potions.</i>

13:10.556 --> 13:13.889
<i>I see you sampled one yourself.</i>

13:13.959 --> 13:17.122
<i>I don't think so, Doc.</i>

13:25.771 --> 13:27.830
I don't think I like
where this is going.

13:27.907 --> 13:30.205
<i>Thanks to Dr. Wilsonstein,</i>

13:30.276 --> 13:33.404
<i>I've turned my horrible family
into zombies.</i>

13:33.479 --> 13:37.142
<i>Now I have the whole house to myself.</i>

13:37.216 --> 13:41.585
<i>- Oh, Clark?
- Well, almost to myself.</i>

13:42.321 --> 13:46.223
<i>- More root beer?
- Don't mind if I do.</i>

13:47.326 --> 13:52.423
<i>Let me in. Let me in.</i>

13:52.498 --> 13:54.728
<i>Let me in.</i>

13:55.301 --> 13:57.565
<i>Clark, parents.</i>

13:58.671 --> 14:01.697
<i>What are you gonna
do about them, Clarkie?</i>

14:01.774 --> 14:04.004
<i>I'll tell you what I'm going to do.</i>

14:04.076 --> 14:07.637
<i>It's time to say goodbye
to them... forever.</i>

14:19.825 --> 14:23.192
- Hey!
- This is frightening.

14:23.295 --> 14:26.162
It's twisted. It's morbid.
This kid's great!

14:31.170 --> 14:33.434
I thought that Mark
was behaving strangely.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.029
This is worse than I imagined.

14:35.107 --> 14:38.543
What are you talking about?
He wanted to make a hideous movie.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.239
He delivered big time.
This stuff is great!

14:41.313 --> 14:45.613
No. This film is about a boy who thinks
his parents favor his brothers,

14:45.684 --> 14:47.845
so he turns them into freaks
and kills them.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.922
- It's a great premise!
- It's not a premise!

14:51.023 --> 14:54.254
- It's the way he feels about us!
- Oh, stop that.

14:54.326 --> 14:57.989
We don't favor Brad and Randy.
It's just simple Halloween fun.

14:58.063 --> 15:01.032
No. This is a boy who has some issues.
We need to talk to him.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.068
- We're not gonna talk to him.
- Why not?

15:03.168 --> 15:06.797
He's interested. Let's not screw up
something he's excited about.

15:06.872 --> 15:08.840
He's excited about killing us!

15:10.409 --> 15:12.570
At least it's something.

15:15.814 --> 15:18.908
Mom, Dad,
we're almost ready for your scene.

15:43.342 --> 15:48.211
- This is creepy.
- This is great!

15:48.914 --> 15:51.007
I can't wait to do this scene.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.950
And look at this.
These little wax heads.

15:54.019 --> 15:57.182
- They look just like Randy and Brad.
- Dad!

16:00.326 --> 16:03.693
Gosh, this is awful!
I mean, look at this altar.

16:03.762 --> 16:08.290
And the heads in the basket. And
the fog. It's giving me the willies.

16:08.367 --> 16:11.825
But he's decapitated his brothers
in such a fun, creative way.

16:11.904 --> 16:13.064
We're not dead yet.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.107
Mark just wanted to see
how our heads would look in a basket.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.676
I've often wondered that myself.

16:19.545 --> 16:22.105
We're gonna go get our costumes on.

16:22.214 --> 16:24.705
If you were gonna be executed,
how would you dress?

16:24.783 --> 16:26.808
Very slowly.

16:30.155 --> 16:33.124
Think that there's any chance
that Mark really wants to...

16:33.192 --> 16:35.217
Whack us?

16:35.294 --> 16:37.319
I think you got the issues, Jill.

16:37.396 --> 16:39.489
I know. What am I thinking?

16:39.565 --> 16:42.728
He loves us. He's our son.
He would never even think of that.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.666
Ready to die?

16:45.571 --> 16:47.732
Mark, Mark, Mark.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.104
Just because
it's a horror film doesn't mean

16:50.175 --> 16:52.268
everybody has to die. Make it upbeat.

16:52.344 --> 16:56.110
Go another way.
Have the freaks dance.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.411
Have them do some kind of sing-along.

16:58.484 --> 17:03.512
You're an actor, not a dancer.
Your job is to say the lines.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.557
OK! Let's die!

17:07.092 --> 17:10.653
- Dad, you first.
- Good! Good, good, good, good, good!

17:10.762 --> 17:14.460
Gee, thanks, Ronny. You always want
a clean surface for a beheading.

17:14.532 --> 17:17.001
Let me look at that blade there.
Let me see this.

17:17.803 --> 17:18.770
All right.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.772
Now, I hope you're using hard rubber
because that plastic looks so cheesy.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.900
- This is a real blade.
- What?

17:24.977 --> 17:27.104
That's a little dangerous.
Come on, now.

17:27.179 --> 17:30.546
It's only for this shot. I need
the light reflecting off the blade.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.512
Well, what about latex or something?

17:35.554 --> 17:38.648
Roll camera. And... action!

17:45.631 --> 17:46.996
- Cut!
- Don't cut!

17:50.235 --> 17:53.068
- You ruined my shot.
- Well, I'm sorry.

17:53.138 --> 17:56.471
You have to come inside and
talk to us now! Let me have that thing.

17:56.542 --> 17:59.204
- I have to finish my movie.
- We'll talk for a second.

17:59.278 --> 18:01.212
We'll be right back out.

18:02.147 --> 18:03.808
Hold still, Ronny.

18:08.053 --> 18:10.487
Can we make this quick?
I got a picture to shoot.

18:10.556 --> 18:13.889
No, no. We are not going back out
there until we've had a talk.

18:13.959 --> 18:16.519
- This movie has us very concerned.
- Why?

18:16.628 --> 18:20.962
Because it's about a boy named Clark who
thinks his parents favor his brothers.

18:21.033 --> 18:24.332
So he gives them a potion and
turns them into freaks and kills them.

18:24.403 --> 18:27.372
- Too much information.
- You watched my movie?!

18:27.473 --> 18:29.907
We did. We shouldn't
without your permission.

18:29.975 --> 18:32.205
Now that we have,
we're worried about you.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.711
- In spite...
- No. The reason your mom's upset

18:34.780 --> 18:38.113
is she thinks that the movie
is really about how you feel about us.

18:38.183 --> 18:40.481
If that's true,
there's a problem here, Mark.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.611
- It's just a movie.
- But in the movie,

18:42.688 --> 18:46.351
the lead character feels that
his parents favor Chad and Andy.

18:46.425 --> 18:50.725
And your mom thinks that sounds
a tad bit like Brad and Randy.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.356
You put your father on a chopping block

18:54.433 --> 18:58.335
- and go after him with a real blade.
- You think I wanted to kill you?

18:58.403 --> 19:01.702
Well, no. Of course not. No.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.974
Maybe. I don't know. We don't know
what's going on with you lately.

19:06.044 --> 19:09.013
Nothing's going on.
I mean, it's just a movie.

19:09.114 --> 19:11.548
The last months you've been
quiet and withdrawn.

19:11.617 --> 19:15.348
Maybe that's just how I am.
You know, I'm not like Brad and Randy.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.752
Nobody's asking you
to be like Brad and Randy.

19:17.823 --> 19:21.054
- You're different. That's OK.
- It doesn't seem OK.

19:21.126 --> 19:24.289
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you don't like my clothes.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.830
- You don't like my friends.
- OK. OK.

19:26.899 --> 19:30.995
Look, it is hard to come downstairs
one morning and find your son suddenly

19:31.069 --> 19:33.731
dressing, all the time,
in nothing but black clothes.

19:33.805 --> 19:36.296
Yeah.
And with black nail polish.

19:37.509 --> 19:41.570
But, you know, given some time,
we're adjusting to that.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.080
What about Ronny?

19:43.148 --> 19:45.582
It might take a little longer
to adjust to that.

19:48.253 --> 19:51.620
Look, honey, just because
I may not like one of your friends,

19:51.690 --> 19:54.989
or your movie is so good
that it freaks me out,

19:55.060 --> 19:58.962
doesn't mean that I don't love you
as much as I love your brothers.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.398
And we want to support you
in whatever it is that interests you.

20:02.467 --> 20:05.436
- You're not just saying that?
- No. Of course not.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.869
We're your parents.
We're here to help.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.568
- You really want to help?
- Yeah.

20:10.642 --> 20:12.803
Let me chop off your heads.

20:14.980 --> 20:18.916
OK! As long as it's OK with your mom.

20:18.984 --> 20:21.953
How can we deny our youngest son
this simple joy?

20:22.020 --> 20:24.853
- But let's use the hard rubber blade.
- Yeah.

20:28.594 --> 20:31.757
- You think he's gonna be all right?
- He's gonna be fine.

20:31.830 --> 20:33.991
I hope he doesn't
continue to shut us out.

20:34.099 --> 20:37.728
No. This movie's a good expression
for him. It's great. He's talking.

20:37.803 --> 20:40.567
True. He did tell us something
about what he's feeling.

20:40.639 --> 20:42.800
- Yes.
- We know he doesn't want to kill us.

20:42.874 --> 20:46.640
- I wouldn't turn my back on Ronny.
- Oh, no.

21:08.567 --> 21:11.798
Cut. Perfect.
Just need one more shot.

21:11.870 --> 21:15.567
Mark, can you take these stockings
off our faces? They're kind of hot.

21:15.641 --> 21:17.973
Sure.

21:18.043 --> 21:21.342
All right, Ronny. Move the basket
a little closer to the cauldron.

21:21.413 --> 21:22.971
Yeah.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.585
I feel so much lighter.

21:29.888 --> 21:31.583
Yeah, me too.

21:31.657 --> 21:34.626
And that pain
I was having in my back... gone.

21:37.429 --> 21:41.525
No engines allowed!

21:42.501 --> 21:46.198
I will just have to incur
the wrath of the pump... pump...

21:49.107 --> 21:52.042
Just because we may have
a problem with one of your friends,

21:52.110 --> 21:55.876
or your movie's so good
that it freaks us out,

21:55.981 --> 21:59.109
doesn't mean that we
don't love you every bit as much...
