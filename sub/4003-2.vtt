12:39.792 --> 12:41.625
MY KILL TOOLS.

12:41.625 --> 12:43.500
IF THEY'RE HERE
AND BENNY ISN'T,

12:43.500 --> 12:45.583
HE MUST HAVE BEEN THROWN
FROM THE CAR.

12:45.583 --> 12:49.166

THIS IS HIGH PRIORITY.

13:15.333 --> 13:20.667

HIGHER PRIORITY.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.792
IF THAT ONE STOP DOESN'T
GIVE ME BENNY GOMEZ,

13:23.792 --> 13:26.583
I'LL BE RUNNING
OUT OF OPTIONS.

13:26.583 --> 13:28.083

YALE, SODERQUIST,
MORGAN, QUINN...

SHOOTINGS LOW PROFILE.

14:24.917 --> 14:26.667

THE MAYOR IS

14:30.625 --> 14:32.166
THIS THING HAD A BRAND NAME.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.458
IF THOSE BODY PARTS
WERE THROWN FROM THE CAR,

15:28.458 --> 15:29.750
LOCATING THEM
IS A MATTER OF--

15:29.750 --> 15:33.417
- VELOCITY AND TRAJECTORY.

15:33.417 --> 15:36.375
SHOULD BE RIGHT AROUND HERE.

15:43.166 --> 15:44.625
- JUST IMAGINE

THROUGH THAT PHASE IN COLLEGE,

16:55.625 --> 16:57.166
I'D KISS YOU.

16:57.166 --> 16:58.750
- SO WHY ARE YOU INTERESTED

16:58.750 --> 17:00.583
IN A MURDER THAT HAPPENED
WHILE YOU WERE IN DIAPERS?

17:00.583 --> 17:03.041
- A GUY KILLS HIS WIFE WHILE
SHE'S TAKING A BATH

17:03.041 --> 17:04.333
30 YEARS AGO.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.000

17:16.125 --> 17:18.667
SUSANNAH COFFEY.
ANOTHER BLAST FROM THE PAST.

17:18.667 --> 17:20.375
- HMM, WAS SHE
AT LEAST USEFUL?

17:20.375 --> 17:22.000
- ONLY AS A REMINDER
TO WEAR SUNBLOCK.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.542
BUT I'M STILL WAITING
ON A FEW CALL BACKS

17:24.542 --> 17:25.875
FROM SOME OTHER NAMES
ON THE LIST,

17:25.875 --> 17:27.875
BUT SO FAR,
I'M STARTING TO THINK

17:27.875 --> 17:32.041
MAYBE I FUCKED AROUND MORE
THAN MY OLD MAN DID.

17:32.041 --> 17:33.375

BUT WE GOT

18:17.458 --> 18:19.709
TO HAVE SOME GROUND RULES.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.750

18:25.750 --> 18:27.250
ON THE VICTIM'S PERSONAL
EFFECTS.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.875

- EMPTY WALLET, WATCH MISSING,
DRAWER'S EMPTY.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.166

IT'S EASIER TO ROB

18:47.166 --> 18:48.625
PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAD FIRST.

18:48.625 --> 18:51.667
- DIRECTIONAL SWIPE PATTERN
OF ONE OF THE ASSAILANT'S SHOES

18:51.667 --> 18:52.875
SHOWS HE WENT THAT WAY.

18:52.875 --> 18:54.542
- OKAY, ANGEL,
START A CANVASS.

18:54.542 --> 18:56.542
GUESTS, EMPLOYEES,
SECURITY CAMERAS.

18:56.542 --> 18:57.458
- ALREADY HANDLED.

18:57.458 --> 18:59.083

20:01.083 --> 20:03.375
HELPING MY CHOLESTEROL.

20:03.375 --> 20:04.834

20:04.834 --> 20:06.500
I'M SORRY.
THIS IS TOO FUCKING WEIRD.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.709

IT MAKES YOU MORE COMFORTABLE.

20:08.709 --> 20:11.083

20:15.125 --> 20:17.709
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU,
SPOKEN TO YOU,

20:17.709 --> 20:19.750
OR EXCHANGED SO MUCH AS
A FUCKING CHRISTMAS CARD

20:19.750 --> 20:21.250
WITH YOU IN TWO YEARS.

20:21.250 --> 20:23.375
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE IN MIAMI

20:23.375 --> 20:25.125
HOLDING A PAIR OF CHOPSTICKS
WITHOUT SO MUCH

20:25.125 --> 20:27.625
AS AN EMAIL SAYING,
"HEY, REMEMBER ME?

20:27.625 --> 20:29.250
"WE USED TO FUCK.
I'M COMING TO TOWN.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.208
YOU WANT TO GRAB LUNCH?"

20:31.208 --> 20:34.583
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY.
WHAT THE FUCK?

20:34.583 --> 20:37.875
I KNOW.
SAME OLD MOUTH.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.667
- NOT WITHOUT ITS CHARM.

20:39.667 --> 20:40.917
- REALLY?

20:40.917 --> 20:44.500
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE
TO SAY TO ME?

20:44.500 --> 20:48.166
- I SHOULD HAVE LET YOU KNOW
I WAS COMING TO MIAMI.

20:48.166 --> 20:50.291
THIS TASK FORCE THEY'RE TRYING
TO PUT TOGETHER

20:50.291 --> 20:51.583
IS HUSH-HUSH.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.959
PLUS I KNEW YOU'D BE BUSY,

20:58.625 --> 21:00.417
I HAVE A SUSPECT EN ROUTE.

21:00.417 --> 21:02.208

21:02.208 --> 21:04.750
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT LISA BELL?

21:04.750 --> 21:09.750
- ONLY WHAT YOUR BROTHER'S
TOLD ME.

21:09.750 --> 21:13.125
- WELL, "CHECK THIS,"
SHE BRAGS.

21:13.125 --> 21:14.959
WE FOUND ANOTHER MURDER.

21:14.959 --> 21:16.291
30 YEARS OLD.

21:16.291 --> 21:18.000
SAME M.O.,
SAME ADDRESS,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.959
SAME FUCKING BATHTUB.

21:19.959 --> 21:21.000
A GUY WAS CONVICTED.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.166
HE'S BACK OUT IN THE WORLD.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.959
SO HOW DO I NOT LIKE HIM
FOR SLICING UP LISA BELL?

21:24.959 --> 21:27.000
- SOUNDS LIKE HE DESERVES
A GOOD HARD LOOK.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.333
- I HAD PATROL PICK HIM UP.

21:29.333 --> 21:30.959
SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

21:30.959 --> 21:34.083
- MIND IF I TAG ALONG?

21:34.083 --> 21:35.583
- TO THE INTERVIEW?

21:35.583 --> 21:39.834
- I'D LIKE TO SEE DETECTIVE
MORGAN IN ALL HER GLORY.

21:39.834 --> 21:42.750
- SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE'S BORED
WITH RETIREMENT ALREADY.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.250
- HERE YOU GO.
THANKS VERY MUCH.

21:44.250 --> 21:46.542
KEEP THE CHANGE.

21:46.542 --> 21:48.125
COME ON, GUYS.

21:48.125 --> 21:50.250
COME ON, BOYS.

22:02.875 --> 22:04.458
- OH, SORRY, SIR.

22:04.458 --> 22:06.125
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.542
- IT'S OKAY, KIDDO.

22:07.542 --> 22:09.125
IT HAPPENS.

22:09.125 --> 22:10.750
WHAT IS THAT,
STRAWBERRY?

22:10.750 --> 22:12.542
- UH, BUBBLE GUM GELATO.

22:12.542 --> 22:15.875
- HOW, UH...
REPULSIVE.

22:15.875 --> 22:20.083
[chuckles]

22:20.083 --> 22:24.458
YOU BETTER CATCH UP
WITH YOUR MOM.

22:24.458 --> 22:26.333
YOU DON'T WANT
TO LOSE HER.

22:31.625 --> 22:35.917
- JUST HAD TO FIND BLOOD,
DIDN'T YOU?

22:35.917 --> 22:38.000
- IT IS MY JOB.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.792
- AND YOU'VE GOT
A FAMILY TO SUPPORT

22:39.792 --> 22:41.834
AND PEOPLE TO DISMEMBER.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.417
YOU'RE SPINNING
TOO MANY PLATES, DEXTER.

22:43.417 --> 22:45.166
- THE SOONER I WRAP THIS UP,

22:45.166 --> 22:46.834
THE SOONER I GET
TO THE BOXING ARENA.

22:46.834 --> 22:48.041
- YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GIVE SOME THOUGHT

22:48.041 --> 22:48.959
AS TO WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN SOMEBODY ELSE

22:48.959 --> 22:51.041
FINDS THAT BODY.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.375
- [sighs and clears throat]

22:55.375 --> 22:57.542
- MANAGER'S ON HIS WAY
TO OPEN THE SAFE.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.709
- WHAT'S THE DATE OF BIRTH
ON HIS PASSPORT?

22:59.709 --> 23:01.750
- 5/5/72.

23:06.083 --> 23:08.166
[keypad tones]

23:12.959 --> 23:14.834
- [sighs]
GEEZ.

23:36.125 --> 23:37.375
- DON'T SWEAT IT, QUINN.

23:37.375 --> 23:40.500
I'VE GOT MUCH BIGGER THINGS
TO WORRY ABOUT.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.500
- I FILLED IN THE LIEUTENANT
ON WHAT WE FOUND.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.583
- "WE"?

23:44.583 --> 23:46.709
- DUDE, THERE'S
NO "ME" IN "TEAM."

23:46.709 --> 23:49.458
WELL, TECHNICALLY
THERE IS, BUT--

23:49.458 --> 23:50.917
- BLOOD DEPOSIT
ON THE YUCCA

23:50.917 --> 23:52.250
ON THE ASSAILANT'S
ESCAPE ROUTE.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.417
HE PROBABLY SCRAPED HIMSELF.

23:53.417 --> 23:54.750
- DOES THAT MEAN
WE HAVE HIS DNA?

23:54.750 --> 23:55.750
- I'LL RUN IT THROUGH
THE DATABASE

23:55.750 --> 23:56.917
SOON AS I GET BACK
TO THE LAB.

23:56.917 --> 23:58.041
- GO.

23:58.041 --> 24:00.417
YOU, COME WITH ME.

24:00.417 --> 24:02.166
- I'M GOING...

24:02.166 --> 24:04.667
JUST NOT WHERE YOU THINK.

24:04.667 --> 24:07.583
- YOU WERE CONVICTED OF KILLING
YOUR WIFE BACK IN '79.

24:07.583 --> 24:09.417
SLICED OPEN HER
FEMORAL ARTERY.

24:09.417 --> 24:11.333
SHE BLED TO DEATH
IN YOUR BATHTUB.

24:11.333 --> 24:13.417
- DO I NEED TO TALK
TO A LAWYER?

24:13.417 --> 24:15.375
- AT THIS POINT,
WE'RE INTERVIEWING YOU

24:15.375 --> 24:16.917
TO GET MORE OR LESS
AN EXPERT OPINION.

24:16.917 --> 24:18.875
- SEE, YOUR CASE BEARS AN
UNCANNY RESEMBLANCE

24:18.875 --> 24:20.458
TO A CASE WE'RE WORKING
ON NOW.

24:20.458 --> 24:24.542
SAME M.O. A LA
THAT FEMORAL ARTERY.

24:24.542 --> 24:26.917
SAME HOUSE.

24:26.917 --> 24:28.041
- SAME EVERYTHING.

24:28.041 --> 24:30.125
- NO FUCKING WAY.

24:30.125 --> 24:32.166
- YES FUCKING WAY.

24:32.166 --> 24:35.083
SORT OF PUTS YOU AT NUMBER ONE,
PERSON-OF-INTEREST-WISE.

24:35.083 --> 24:36.500
- I DIDN'T KILL MY WIFE.

24:36.500 --> 24:37.834
- OH, NO?

24:37.834 --> 24:39.458
YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER
INNOCENT MAN BEHIND BARS

24:39.458 --> 24:40.500
FOR NO GOOD REASON.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.417
- THE FUCKING DECK
WAS STACKED

24:42.417 --> 24:44.166
BEFORE I WALKED INTO
THAT COURTROOM

24:44.166 --> 24:46.166
IN A DEATH PENALTY STATE.

24:46.166 --> 24:48.125
- YOU COPPED
TO DOING THE DEED.

24:48.125 --> 24:49.417
YOU TOOK THE DEAL.

24:49.417 --> 24:50.959
- I DID MY TIME
AND I MOVED ON.

24:50.959 --> 24:52.000
- YOU MOVED ON TO LISA BELL.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.125
- WHO IS LISA BELL?

24:54.125 --> 24:56.583
- THE YOUNG LADY THAT YOU KILLED
LAST MONDAY NIGHT

24:56.583 --> 24:58.500
IN YOUR OLD HOUSE.

24:58.500 --> 25:03.875
WHATEVER SICK FUCKING POETRY
YOU FIND IN THAT.

25:03.875 --> 25:08.375
TELL US WHAT YOU DID,
MR. NOONAN.

25:08.375 --> 25:13.208
- IT WAS MUGGY
FOR SO LATE AT NIGHT.

25:13.208 --> 25:16.917
AND VICKY, MY WIFE...

25:16.917 --> 25:20.709
WANTED TO COOL OFF
IN THE TUB, SO...

25:20.709 --> 25:26.083
I WENT OUT TO SCORE SOME SHIT
AND I CAME BACK.

25:26.083 --> 25:28.500
AND I FOUND HER.

25:28.500 --> 25:34.417
[weeping]

25:34.417 --> 25:36.041
- I WISH I COULD BUY
THE TEARS.

25:36.041 --> 25:38.000
I JUST...

25:38.000 --> 25:40.166
I CAN'T GET THERE.

25:40.166 --> 25:42.500
- MONDAY NIGHT I WAS WORKING
A SWING SHIFT

25:42.500 --> 25:44.375
AT THE HOMELESS SHELTER
IN ALLAPATAH

25:44.375 --> 25:46.208
HOSING PISS OFF
THE SIDEWALK

25:46.208 --> 25:48.250
FROM THE FOLKS WAITING
TO GET INSIDE

25:48.250 --> 25:52.875
UNTIL 8:00-FUCKING-A.M.

25:52.875 --> 25:54.875
- WE'LL CALL
THE HOMELESS SHELTER.

25:54.875 --> 25:56.709
VERIFY YOUR STORY.

26:02.375 --> 26:05.333
- ONE, THE GUY'S
A TRAIN WRECK.

26:05.333 --> 26:07.750
TWO, HE'S A TOTAL SLOB,
HE SMELLS LIKE A SEWER,

26:07.750 --> 26:09.375
AND HIS FINGERNAILS
ARE DISGUSTING.

26:09.375 --> 26:10.375
- OUR KILLER'S METICULOUS.

26:10.375 --> 26:12.583
ZERO DNA LEFT
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

26:12.583 --> 26:13.917
- OBVIOUSLY YOU CAUGHT HIS
CASE OF THE SHAKES.

26:13.917 --> 26:16.375
- GIVEN HIS REHAB HISTORY,
I'M VOTING DTs.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.333
- AND LISA BELL WAS CUT
WITH SURGICAL PRECISION.

26:18.333 --> 26:22.375
- SO, DETECTIVE MORGAN...

26:22.375 --> 26:23.542
ARE WE IN AGREEMENT HERE?

26:23.542 --> 26:25.750
- VIOLENT AGREEMENT...

26:25.750 --> 26:27.583
RETIRED SPECIAL AGENT LUNDY.

26:27.583 --> 26:29.917
- IF NOONAN DIDN'T
KILL LISA BELL,

26:29.917 --> 26:32.583
WHY IS THE M.O. THE SAME
AS HIS WIFE'S MURDER?

26:32.583 --> 26:33.417
- COPYCAT?

26:33.417 --> 26:35.583
- OF AN OBSCURE
30-YEAR-OLD CRIME?

26:35.583 --> 26:38.458
- DO WE THINK NOONAN'S
TELLING THE TRUTH...

26:38.458 --> 26:40.250
THAT HE DIDN'T KILL
HIS WIFE?

26:40.250 --> 26:41.917
- I BELIEVE WE DO.

26:41.917 --> 26:43.792
- SHIT.

26:43.792 --> 26:46.959
- I HAVE A THEORY I'D LIKE
TO RUN BY YOU.

26:46.959 --> 26:49.125
WE COULD GRAB DINNER,
REVIEW THE CASE,

26:49.125 --> 26:51.792
MAYBE CATCH A BAD GUY.

26:51.792 --> 26:57.500
- I...UH...

26:57.500 --> 26:59.500
OKAY, I GUESS.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.417
UM, I'VE GOT
TO CUT NOONAN LOOSE

27:01.417 --> 27:03.709
AND MAKE SURE HE TALKS
TO A LAWYER.

27:03.709 --> 27:07.000
IF OUR SIDE RAILROADED HIM
INTO THAT PLEA BARGAIN,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.375
HE COULD HAVE ONE FUCK MOTHER
OF A CASE.

27:09.375 --> 27:11.875
- YOU HAVE A GOOD HEART,
DEBRA.

27:11.875 --> 27:13.291
PICK YOU UP AROUND 8:00?

27:13.291 --> 27:16.709
- YEAH, SO I'LL--

27:16.709 --> 27:20.417
YES.
YES.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.750
- THE BOXING ARENA'S
AT THE NEXT OFF RAMP,

27:51.750 --> 27:54.792
BUT I STILL HAVE MILES
TO GO BEFORE I SLEEP.

27:59.417 --> 28:02.917
BITS AND PIECES.

28:02.917 --> 28:05.625
MEMORY FRAGMENTS.

28:05.625 --> 28:07.792
ALL I HAVE FROM LAST NIGHT.

28:25.000 --> 28:29.041
LOOKS LIKE I GOT THE JOB DONE.

28:29.041 --> 28:32.083
ALMOST.

28:32.083 --> 28:34.875
BLOOD.

28:34.875 --> 28:38.709
I WAS OFF MY GAME.

28:38.709 --> 28:41.208
SLOPPY.

28:41.208 --> 28:42.750
WITH HARRY'S CODE
INGRAINED IN ME,

28:42.750 --> 28:45.041
CLEANING A KILL ROOM
SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC.

28:45.041 --> 28:46.709
THE CODE.

28:46.709 --> 28:49.834
ETCHED INTO MY MEMORY
TO ENSURE SURVIVAL.

28:49.834 --> 28:53.709
WHAT WOULD I DO IF I COULDN'T
PROPERLY DISPOSE OF A BODY?

28:53.709 --> 28:56.834
I'D HIDE IT.

29:00.041 --> 29:05.458
I INVESTIGATE CRIME SCENES
ALL THE TIME.

29:05.458 --> 29:07.208
BUT THIS ONE...

29:07.208 --> 29:10.709
MY CRIME SCENE...

29:10.709 --> 29:15.583
IT'S GIVING ME NOTHING.

29:15.583 --> 29:18.500
DAMN IT.

29:18.500 --> 29:19.750
FOCUS.

29:19.750 --> 29:21.125
TRACK IT.

29:21.125 --> 29:22.959
WHERE DID I GO FROM HERE?

29:22.959 --> 29:26.417
THE PHARMACY.

29:26.417 --> 29:28.834
HARRISON'S EAR ACHE MEDICINE.

29:28.834 --> 29:32.542
THE ONLY STOP I MADE
BEFORE THE CRASH.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.875
THE ONLY STOP I REMEMBER.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.792
- IF YOU THOUGHT YOU
WERE COMING RIGHT BACK,

29:54.792 --> 29:56.458
NOT A BAD HIDING PLACE.

29:56.458 --> 29:58.750
- WHY ARE YOU WEARING THOSE?

29:58.750 --> 30:03.291
- THIS IS THE WAY I WAS DRESSED
THE FIRST TIME WE MET.

30:03.291 --> 30:05.083
YOUR MOTHER'S MURDER
WAS THE LAST TIME

30:05.083 --> 30:06.291
YOUR MEMORY WAS A BLANK.

30:06.291 --> 30:07.375
WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT IS?

30:07.375 --> 30:09.291
- NOT IN FRONT OF MY BABY!
NO!

30:09.291 --> 30:11.792
[screaming]

30:11.792 --> 30:14.166
- BECAUSE NOT REMEMBERING
SAVED ME.

30:14.166 --> 30:15.500
- AND NOW IF YOU WANT
TO SAVE YOURSELF,

30:15.500 --> 30:17.625
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER.

30:24.333 --> 30:25.959
IF YOU DON'T FIX
THIS SCREW-UP,

30:25.959 --> 30:27.458
HARRISON'S ONLY MEMORY
OF HIS FATHER

30:27.458 --> 30:28.959
WILL BE OF YOU BEHIND BARS.

30:28.959 --> 30:30.291
- IT'S NOT A SCREW-UP.

30:30.291 --> 30:33.792
I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER.

30:33.792 --> 30:35.834
GOT TO CHECK TODAY'S
INCIDENT REPORTS.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.625
MAKE SURE BENNY'S BODY
HASN'T SURFACED.

30:39.625 --> 30:42.166
IT'S IN THIS CITY SOMEWHERE.

30:42.166 --> 30:44.041
- THANKS FOR MEETING ME HERE.

30:44.041 --> 30:45.709
THE SOONER WE GET AN ESTIMATE
AND FILE A CLAIM,

30:45.709 --> 30:47.375
THE SOONER MY HUSBAND
GETS HIS CAR BACK.

30:47.375 --> 30:49.125
- WELL, THAT MUCH DAMAGE,
I WOULDN'T EVEN TRY

30:49.125 --> 30:53.500
TO TALK YOU INTO FIXING IT.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.250
- I THOUGHT IT WAS
A FENDER BENDER.

30:55.250 --> 30:57.000
- WELL, I'M SURE THERE'S
A BENT FENDER

30:57.000 --> 30:58.417
SOMEWHERE IN THIS MESS.

30:58.417 --> 30:59.834
- OH, MY GOD.

30:59.834 --> 31:02.041
- EVERYBODY GOT OFF EASY
ON THIS ONE.

31:02.041 --> 31:04.458
YOUR HUSBAND, MY COMPANY.

31:04.458 --> 31:07.834
HE SHOULD COUNT HIS BLESSINGS.

31:07.834 --> 31:10.208
- YES, HE SHOULD.

31:10.208 --> 31:11.959
- HEY, BUDDY.
YOU LOSE SOMETHING?

31:11.959 --> 31:14.667
- THERE'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

31:14.667 --> 31:16.417
CAN'T FIND MY I.D.

31:16.417 --> 31:18.875
- USE MINE TO BUZZ YOU IN.

31:18.875 --> 31:21.417
- ALL RIGHT.

31:21.417 --> 31:22.709
THANKS.

31:22.709 --> 31:24.375
- LOOK, THE OTHER DAY
AFTER COURT,

31:24.375 --> 31:26.792
I WAS TOTALLY OUT OF LINE GOING
OFF ON YOU LIKE THAT.

31:26.792 --> 31:29.041
GOMEZ IS THE CRIMINAL,
NOT YOU.

31:29.041 --> 31:30.000
- NO, NOT ME.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.667
- PLAN ON HAVING
A HEART-TO-HEART

31:31.667 --> 31:33.375
WITH THE PRICK
WHEN I FIND HIM.

31:33.375 --> 31:34.792
- BENNY?

31:34.792 --> 31:36.500
- YEAH, WANT HIM TO KNOW
HE'S STILL ON MY RADAR,

31:36.500 --> 31:38.083
BUT HE'S BEEN LAYING LOW.

31:38.083 --> 31:39.375
[door buzzes]

31:39.375 --> 31:41.750
- LOOK, CAN WE DO THIS
ANOTHER TIME?

31:58.291 --> 32:00.208
MY PASSWORD.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.834
- ACCESS DENIED, DEX.

32:07.834 --> 32:11.959
- I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
MY OWN PASSWORD.

32:11.959 --> 32:14.792
- I'M HERE TO HELP.

32:14.792 --> 32:20.667
THINK.

32:20.667 --> 32:23.875
- H-A-R-R-Y.

32:27.083 --> 32:31.417
THANKS, DAD.

32:31.417 --> 32:32.458
BANK HOLD-UP.

32:32.458 --> 32:34.625
ALLIGATOR IN BACKYARD.

32:34.625 --> 32:38.083
KIDNAPPED THREE YEAR OLD
FOUND SAFE.

32:38.083 --> 32:40.250
BUT NO BODY PARTS TURNING UP.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.083
[sighs]

33:02.291 --> 33:07.125
FROM BOXING ARENA, TO PHARMACY,
TO THE CRASH.

33:07.125 --> 33:12.792
WHAT AM I MISSING?

33:12.792 --> 33:15.667
- GIRL SCOUT COOKIE
TIME AGAIN?

33:15.667 --> 33:18.458
- NO, I FROZE THEM
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY.

33:18.458 --> 33:21.333
- WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY?

33:21.333 --> 33:22.458
- FRANK LUNDY.

33:22.458 --> 33:25.166
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM
IN, LIKE, FOREVER,

33:25.166 --> 33:26.667
AND THEN HE SHOWS UP OUT
OF THE BLUE

33:26.667 --> 33:28.625
FOR SOME HUSH-HUSH TASK FORCE
AND WANTS TO KNOW

33:28.625 --> 33:30.333
ALL ABOUT MY CASE.

33:30.333 --> 33:32.000
NOT TO DRAG YOU INTO MY SHIT.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.250
- DRAG AWAY.

33:33.250 --> 33:35.625
IN THIS BOYS' CLUB,
WHO ELSE YOU GONNA TALK TO?

33:35.625 --> 33:38.000
- THIS IS ABOUT HIM TRYING
TO GET NEXT TO ME.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.625
- MAYBE, BUT YOU DO HAVE
A BOYFRIEND.

33:40.625 --> 33:42.500
- HELL YEAH, I DO.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.667
A GOOD ONE.

33:44.667 --> 33:46.125
AND I'M REALLY FUCKING HAPPY.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.667
- CAN I MAKE
A SUGGESTION

33:47.667 --> 33:50.500
BEFORE YOU EAT
THE BOX TOO?

33:50.500 --> 33:53.709
IF THERE IS STILL
SOMETHING, ANYTHING,

33:53.709 --> 33:54.667
BETWEEN YOU AND LUNDY--

33:54.667 --> 33:56.667
- THERE'S SO NOT.

33:56.667 --> 34:00.917
- CLOSURE WILL SET YOU FREE.

34:00.917 --> 34:03.625
DOES MY HAIR LOOK BETTER
UP OR DOWN?

34:03.625 --> 34:06.542
- DOWN DEFINITELY.

34:06.542 --> 34:08.333
- THANKS.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.375
- OKAY, BENNY,
I GOT TO FIND YOU

34:13.375 --> 34:15.041
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE DOES.

34:15.041 --> 34:16.875
BETTER FUCKING START
ALL OVER AGAIN.

34:16.875 --> 34:19.875
NOTHING ON THE DNA RESULTS
FROM THE BLOOD ON THE CACTUS.

34:19.875 --> 34:22.542
NO MATCH IN THE DATABASE.
SORRY.

34:22.542 --> 34:24.375
- HANG ON.
NO ONE'S GOING ANYWHERE.

34:24.375 --> 34:25.667
- OH, SHIT.

34:25.667 --> 34:27.000
- LISTEN UP, GUYS.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.375
EVERYONE WORKING
THE VACATION MURDERS,

34:28.375 --> 34:30.375
I'M HOLDING OVER YOUR SHIFT
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

34:30.375 --> 34:32.667
CALL HOME, LET YOUR PEOPLE KNOW
THEY'LL SEE YOU

34:32.667 --> 34:33.834
WHEN THEY SEE YOU.

34:33.834 --> 34:35.917
- QUINN, MY OFFICE.

34:50.583 --> 34:52.291
I'M GONNA ASK YOU
IF WE HAVE A PROBLEM

34:52.291 --> 34:53.834
AND I EXPECT THE TRUTH.

34:53.834 --> 34:56.083
- LOOK, LIEUTENANT,
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE HOTEL,

34:56.083 --> 34:58.250
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

34:58.250 --> 35:01.166
- DETECTIVE...

35:01.166 --> 35:02.583
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU
WHO TO DATE.

35:02.583 --> 35:04.000
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.208
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

35:05.208 --> 35:07.333
AS OFF THE RECORD
WITH REPORTERS.

35:07.333 --> 35:10.750
SO WATCH THE PILLOW TALK
WITH THAT WOMAN.

35:10.750 --> 35:12.583
- NOT A PROBLEM, LIEUTENANT.

35:12.583 --> 35:15.041
TALKING ISN'T
WHAT WE DO BEST ANYWAY.

35:34.625 --> 35:36.709
- DEBRA?

35:36.709 --> 35:37.959
I THOUGHT I WAS
PICKING YOU UP.

35:37.959 --> 35:39.917
- I NEED TO CLEAR
SOME THINGS UP

35:39.917 --> 35:43.417
AND I OWE YOU NOTHING LESS
THAN COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY.

35:43.417 --> 35:47.542
- WANT ANYTHING?

35:47.542 --> 35:49.792
TEA? WATER?

35:49.792 --> 35:51.917
- I DON'T WANT
TO MISLEAD YOU.

35:51.917 --> 35:54.583
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOU.

35:54.583 --> 35:59.000
IT'S JUST THAT
WHAT I HAVE WITH ANTON,

35:59.000 --> 36:01.625
IT'S GREAT.

36:01.625 --> 36:05.083
IT'S REALLY FUCKING GREAT
AND WE LIVE TOGETHER.

36:05.083 --> 36:07.208
AND...

36:07.208 --> 36:08.834
IT'S GREAT.

36:08.834 --> 36:12.458
AND...FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN SO LONG,

36:12.458 --> 36:15.458
I'M ACTUALLY...

36:15.458 --> 36:17.834
HAPPY.

36:17.834 --> 36:19.291
NO OFFENSE.

36:19.291 --> 36:20.875
- YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT SOMETHING TO DRINK?

36:20.875 --> 36:23.375
- DID YOU NOT HEAR
A WORD I JUST SAID?

36:23.375 --> 36:24.667
- EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

36:24.667 --> 36:26.250
- EXACTLY.

36:26.250 --> 36:30.166
SO IF YOU'VE COME BACK
HERE TO...

36:30.166 --> 36:34.166
REKINDLE SOMETHING
BETWEEN US...

36:34.166 --> 36:35.792
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

36:35.792 --> 36:38.542
- IN THE INTEREST
OF TRANSPARENCY,

36:38.542 --> 36:40.834
MY PURPOSE IN COMING
TO MIAMI IS--

36:40.834 --> 36:42.709
- WORK RELATED.

36:42.709 --> 36:44.750
CUT THE SHIT, FRANK.
YOU'RE RETIRED.

36:44.750 --> 36:47.500
- THE REASON I'M IN MIAMI

36:47.500 --> 36:51.333
IS BECAUSE I'M CONVINCED THAT
THESE BATHTUB MURDERS--

36:51.333 --> 36:54.500
NOONAN'S WIFE, LISA BELL--
ARE CONNECTED

36:54.500 --> 36:57.500
TO A SERIES OF MURDERS
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

37:08.083 --> 37:09.500
- OH.

37:09.500 --> 37:15.333
- IT'S BECOME SOMETHING
OF AN OBSESSION OF MINE AND...

37:15.333 --> 37:17.542
I'M NOT ABOUT TO RIDE OFF
INTO THE SUNSET

37:17.542 --> 37:19.458
AND DUMP SOMETHING
THIS HORRIFIC

37:19.458 --> 37:21.542
ON WHOEVER GETS
MY OFFICE NEXT.

37:21.542 --> 37:23.875
- CHRIST.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.417
I--

37:26.417 --> 37:27.959
[chuckles]
I'VE GOT TO GO.

37:27.959 --> 37:29.291
I'M AN IDIOT.

37:29.291 --> 37:31.333
- DEBRA.

37:42.041 --> 37:43.792
- RITA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

37:43.792 --> 37:45.333
- YOU LIED TO ME, DEXTER.

37:45.333 --> 37:47.500
I SAW YOUR CAR.
IT WASN'T A FENDER BENDER.

37:47.500 --> 37:48.542
IT WAS DESTROYED.

37:48.542 --> 37:50.333
- I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO WORRY.

37:50.333 --> 37:52.375
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB.

37:52.375 --> 37:53.750
I'M WORRIED SICK ABOUT YOU.

37:53.750 --> 37:56.792
- I'M FINE.

37:56.792 --> 37:59.041
ALL RIGHT, A LITTLE HEADACHE
AND A STIFF NECK.

37:59.041 --> 38:00.709
- GET YOUR STUFF.
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU HOME.

38:00.709 --> 38:01.709
- I CAN'T.

38:01.709 --> 38:03.000
THE LIEUTENANT IS HOLDING
OVER THE SHIFT

38:03.000 --> 38:06.917
BECAUSE OF THESE MURDERS
THAT ARE IN ALL THE PAPERS.

38:06.917 --> 38:08.458
- YOU FELL ASLEEP
AT THE WHEEL.

38:08.458 --> 38:10.542
ALMOST GOT KILLED BECAUSE
OF THE HOURS

38:10.542 --> 38:12.917
THAT THEY KEEP YOU HERE NIGHT
AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT.

38:12.917 --> 38:14.917
- SO MUCH FOR
MY STANDARD ALIBI.

38:14.917 --> 38:16.458
THIS IS A JOB
I SIGNED ON FOR.

38:16.458 --> 38:17.834
- I'M SORRY.

38:17.834 --> 38:19.291
I DIDN'T SIGN ON
TO BE A WIDOW.

38:19.291 --> 38:20.625
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL JUST TALK TO MARIA MYSELF.

38:20.625 --> 38:22.333
- RITA, NO.
DON'T DO THIS.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.333
NOT HERE.
THIS IS MY JOB.

38:24.333 --> 38:27.417
IT'S HOW I SUPPORT
ALL OF US.

38:27.417 --> 38:30.417
- WHAT IF YOU WIND UP DEAD
IN A DITCH?

38:30.417 --> 38:36.166
- ALL THESE PEOPLE PUT IN
THE SAME HOURS THAT I DO.

38:36.166 --> 38:38.834
- YES, BUT YOU WERE
IN THE HOSPITAL LAST NIGHT.

38:38.834 --> 38:40.125
THEY WEREN'T.

38:40.125 --> 38:43.709
- AND THE DOCTOR GAVE ME
A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.

38:43.709 --> 38:47.458
YOU COULD TALK
TO HIM YOURSELF.

38:47.458 --> 38:51.333
[keypad tones]

38:51.333 --> 38:53.166
- NO.
NO, I DON'T--

38:53.166 --> 38:54.709
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
TO YOUR DOCTOR.

38:54.709 --> 38:56.041
- I WANT YOU TO.

38:56.041 --> 38:58.083
- I MEAN, I GUESS HE WOULDN'T
HAVE RELEASED YOU

38:58.083 --> 39:01.041
IF IT WAS ANYTHING SERIOUS.

39:01.041 --> 39:04.125
- I'M SURE THEY'D ALL RATHER BE
HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES,

39:04.125 --> 39:07.458
JUST LIKE ME.

39:07.458 --> 39:09.166
- I KNOW.

39:09.166 --> 39:12.125
- COME ON,
I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

39:18.166 --> 39:20.291
[elevator bell dings]

39:25.750 --> 39:27.792
[sighs]

39:36.041 --> 39:37.000
- YOU GONNA PICK THAT UP?

39:37.000 --> 39:38.875
- NO, I AM NOT, VINCE.

39:38.875 --> 39:42.041
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

39:42.041 --> 39:44.208
- DUDE, SERIOUSLY,
86 THE CAFFEINE.

39:44.208 --> 39:45.875
YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT.

39:45.875 --> 39:47.875
- I HAVE SOMEPLACE
I NEED TO BE.

39:47.875 --> 39:49.750
- I ALSO HAVE PLACES
I NEED TO BE.

39:49.750 --> 39:55.375
NOT GOOD PLACES,
BUT...PLACES.

39:55.375 --> 39:56.792
- COME ON, BLOOD.

39:56.792 --> 40:00.583
TALK TO ME.

40:00.583 --> 40:03.500
IF SOMEBODY TESTED POSITIVE
FOR AN STD,

40:03.500 --> 40:07.208
WOULD THEY HAVE TO REGISTER WITH
THE MIAMI HEALTH AUTHORITIES?

40:07.208 --> 40:09.166
- AND WHY WOULD YOU
ASK ME THAT?

40:09.166 --> 40:11.333
- YES OR NO, VINCE?

40:16.625 --> 40:18.792
LIEUTENANT.

40:18.792 --> 40:20.125
FOUND YOUR GUY.

40:20.125 --> 40:21.709
NAME'S JOHNNY ROSE.

40:21.709 --> 40:22.875
- YOU FOUND A SUSPECT?

40:22.875 --> 40:24.083
- ALL HIS INFO'S IN THERE.

40:24.083 --> 40:26.500
- HOW?

40:26.500 --> 40:28.750
- I REWORKED THE BLOOD SAMPLE
LOOKING FOR OTHER MARKERS

40:28.750 --> 40:32.333
AND FOUND A STREET 14 STRAIN
OF DRUG-RESISTANT SYPHILIS.

40:32.333 --> 40:34.583
I CHECKED THAT AGAINST
THE STD REGISTRY

40:34.583 --> 40:37.250
FOR ANYONE BEING TREATED
WITH HEAVY-DUTY MEDS

40:37.250 --> 40:38.542
OVER THE LAST WEEK.

40:38.542 --> 40:41.208
TURNED UP A FEW PROSTITUTES
AND ONE JOHNNY ROSE.

40:41.208 --> 40:43.125
GOOD SCIENCE SAYS
HE'S YOUR GUY.

40:43.125 --> 40:45.500
- OKAY, BRIEFING ROOM
IN FIVE MINUTES.

40:45.500 --> 40:47.041

DEXTER'S TURNED UP A LEAD

40:53.583 --> 40:55.917
- I NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE.
- GOOD WORK BACK THERE.

40:55.917 --> 40:57.750
THIS ROSE GUY GETS SYPHILIS
AND FINGERED FOR MURDER?

40:57.750 --> 40:59.375
THAT'S BURNING IT
AT BOTH ENDS, HUH?

40:59.375 --> 41:01.834
- YEAH, I REALLY GOT TO GO.
WIFE, KIDS.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.542

41:23.250 --> 41:27.291

I SAW YOU.

41:27.291 --> 41:31.166
- MOMENT OF YOUR TIME,
LIEUTENANT?

41:31.166 --> 41:35.250
ESCUCHAME,  MARIA.

41:35.250 --> 41:38.041
- ANGEL...

41:38.041 --> 41:40.667
PEOPLE WILL THINK
SOMETHING'S UP.

41:40.667 --> 41:45.500
- SOMETHING IS.

41:45.500 --> 41:46.959
- ANGEL, IF THIS IS
ABOUT THE MAYOR,

41:46.959 --> 41:48.375
I HAD NO CHOICE.

41:48.375 --> 41:51.166
- I'M NOT ANGRY ABOUT YOU TAKING
ME OFF THE CASE.

41:51.166 --> 41:52.500
IT'S HOW YOU DID IT.

41:52.500 --> 41:56.709
- ANGEL, POR FAVOR.

41:56.709 --> 41:59.333
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
TO ACT AROUND YOU ANYMORE.

41:59.333 --> 42:01.291
- THIS ISN'T EASY
FOR ME EITHER.

42:06.166 --> 42:08.875
MAYBE WE NEED A...

42:08.875 --> 42:11.583
BREAK.

42:11.583 --> 42:14.500
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

42:14.500 --> 42:19.000
IT'S PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.458
SO THAT'S THAT.

42:22.458 --> 42:25.750
- SO THAT'S THAT.

42:44.834 --> 42:47.000
- SO?

42:47.000 --> 42:51.250
- SO.

42:51.250 --> 42:54.166
WHY ARE WE THINKING OURSELVES
OUT OF A GOOD THING?

43:03.917 --> 43:05.625
- WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
GOING ON IN THERE?

43:16.542 --> 43:17.959

43:17.959 --> 43:20.500
- CAN'T A GIRLFRIEND BE GLAD
HER BOYFRIEND'S HOME?

43:20.500 --> 43:23.291

IN SO MANY WAYS.

44:28.959 --> 44:31.458
- [chuckles]
YEAH, I SEE THAT NOW.
