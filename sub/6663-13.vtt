00:00.066 --> 00:02.201
Adult adam:
<i>This is my mom,</i>
<i>beverly goldberg,</i>

00:02.203 --> 00:04.636
<i>A shoulder-padded,</i>
<i>country-haired mother warrior</i>

00:04.638 --> 00:06.905
<i>Whose top priority</i>
<i>was always her kids.</i>

00:06.907 --> 00:10.509
<i>Before helicopter moms</i>
<i>and attachment parenting,</i>

00:10.511 --> 00:13.245
<i>She was the original smother.</i>

00:14.080 --> 00:16.348
Snuggle bug,
circular motions.

00:16.350 --> 00:20.352
We've had
this discussion.
Just give it to me.

00:21.087 --> 00:21.553
See?

00:21.555 --> 00:22.955
Feel that difference?
Make a bunny face.

00:22.957 --> 00:26.392
<i>She was all over us</i>
<i>from early in the morning</i>

00:26.394 --> 00:27.393
<i>To late at night.</i>

00:27.395 --> 00:29.628
Who wants
a sleepover snack?

00:29.630 --> 00:30.362
(chuckles)

00:30.364 --> 00:33.265
First one to fall asleep
gets their bra frozen.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.433
Why are you in here?

00:34.435 --> 00:36.935
<i>She even found a way</i>
<i>to smother us at school.</i>

00:36.937 --> 00:39.038
(gasps) mom?
Don't mind me.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.205
Soccer tryouts
are this afternoon.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.808
You need that
to protect your
special spot.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.576
I know what it's for.
Just leave.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.278
<i>But nothing put</i>
<i>a bounce in her step</i>

00:46.280 --> 00:49.548
<i>More than planning</i>
<i>our futures for us.</i>

00:49.550 --> 00:50.849
Oh, this is just
so exciting!

00:50.851 --> 00:54.319
So many choices,
how are we ever
gonna decide?

00:54.321 --> 00:56.055
"we"? No, I'm deciding.

00:56.057 --> 00:59.792
Oh, if it were your
decision, you'd go
to hawaii university.

00:59.794 --> 01:04.263
Uh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:04.265 --> 01:06.632
They have a college
in hawaii?

01:06.634 --> 01:09.201
How did they get
a school on an island?

01:09.203 --> 01:13.572
Oh, my! I got to
check this out!
<i>Aloha!</i>

01:14.140 --> 01:14.606
What's this?

01:14.608 --> 01:18.077
A prestigious college
right in our hometown
of philadelphia?

01:18.079 --> 01:19.278
Yeah, there's
no way in hell

01:19.280 --> 01:22.581
I am living at home
and going to drexel.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.783
Hear you loud
and clear.

01:25.151 --> 01:26.351
Hello, drexel.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.687
I'm beverly goldberg.
This is erica.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.656
I don't want to
build her up too much,

01:30.658 --> 01:32.691
But she is literally
the best student

01:32.693 --> 01:33.592
That ever has been
or will be.

01:33.594 --> 01:37.129
(chuckles)
uh, besides having
a great personality,

01:37.131 --> 01:41.100
She gets good grades,
does meals on wheels,
model un

01:41.102 --> 01:43.669
And is a volunteer
swim instructor at the "y."

01:43.671 --> 01:45.571
For the love of god,
stop talking!

01:45.573 --> 01:49.074
You're parading me
around like a poodle
and it's embarrassing.

01:49.076 --> 01:50.142
Honey, I'm your mother.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.743
It is my job to
strong-arm people

01:51.745 --> 01:53.946
Into seeing
how amazing you are.

01:53.948 --> 01:54.613
Look around.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.783
No other mothers
insist on being
so involved.

01:57.785 --> 01:58.484
Betsy: Beverly!

01:58.486 --> 02:01.086
Adult adam:
<i>But that wasn't true.</i>

02:01.154 --> 02:04.156
<i>Her name was betsy rubenstone,</i>
<i>the other smother.</i>

02:04.158 --> 02:07.392
<i>She was head of the pta,</i>
<i>chair of the fall festival</i>

02:07.394 --> 02:10.329
<i>And eight other</i>
<i>parent committees.</i>

02:10.331 --> 02:11.063
<i>My mom volunteered, too,</i>

02:11.065 --> 02:16.301
<i>But betsy was just made</i>
<i>better, stronger, faster.</i>

02:17.070 --> 02:18.670
Ah, betsy!

02:18.672 --> 02:19.271
Oh! Mwah!

02:19.273 --> 02:22.274
So, what school
are you thinking
about for carin?

02:22.276 --> 02:24.610
She's already been
early-accepted to yale.

02:24.612 --> 02:25.644
(clicks tongue)

02:25.646 --> 02:29.014
Today's all about getting
a jump-start for michael.

02:29.115 --> 02:31.783
Isn't he a sophomore?
It's never too early.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.152
I mean,
he only has a 3.8,

02:33.154 --> 02:34.186
So I'm pushing
the extracurriculars.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.455
He's on the debate team,
tours middle schools
with dare,

02:36.457 --> 02:38.157
And he was just riffin
"west side story."

02:38.159 --> 02:41.460
Riff? That's... What?
Like third lead.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.395
Michael's too busy
to be tony.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.163
He's swamped. (sighs)

02:44.165 --> 02:46.398
He can't even be student
council treasurer this year,

02:46.400 --> 02:47.499
Even though he always
runs unopposed.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.669
<i>Betsy and my mom</i>
<i>had been at war for years</i>

02:50.671 --> 02:52.804
<i>Over whose kids were better.</i>

02:52.806 --> 02:53.705
(bell dings)

02:53.707 --> 02:56.542
My little science wiz.
Isn't he amazing?

02:56.544 --> 02:57.976
(coughing)
she built it for him.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.012
(bell dings)
<i>betsy was winning.</i>

03:00.014 --> 03:03.815
Well, barry's busy, too.
Um, he makes up rap songs.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.817
They call him big tasty.

03:05.819 --> 03:06.919
And he does karate

03:06.921 --> 03:09.721
And plays harmonica
and basketball.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.356
Barry made varsity?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.758
More like street ball.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.594
He plays in the street
and in our driveway,

03:15.596 --> 03:16.395
Which leads to the street.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.565
I'm not sure you can
put that on a college
resume. (laughs)

03:19.567 --> 03:20.899
It's a gray area.
You know.

03:20.901 --> 03:24.469
Point is, though,
he will be going to
an ivy league school.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.838
Probably not yale
'cause I haven't
heard great things.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.807
Check it out,
hawaii university!

03:28.809 --> 03:32.644
It's real, and he said
they accept americans!

03:32.879 --> 03:33.278
(laughs)

03:33.280 --> 03:35.847
He's kidding!
Oh, class clown.
Kids love him.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.917
Sense of humor,
it's such a commodity
in today's economy.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.253
Hi.
Anyway, bye-bye, now.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.421
What's the matter?

03:42.423 --> 03:44.022
You're not going
to school in hawaii.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.391
It's surrounded by sharks,
and even if I did let you go,

03:46.393 --> 03:50.896
It would be a stretch
because you don't have
a single club on your resume.

03:50.898 --> 03:51.396
Not true.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.832
I'm founding member
of the beat-box club.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.734
It's not official,
but that's by choice

03:55.736 --> 03:57.936
'cause then
we'd be sellouts.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.439
(beat-boxing)

04:01.541 --> 04:04.610
Listen, I just heard
there's an opening

04:04.612 --> 04:07.346
For school treasurer,
unopposed.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.615
Think about it.
It's a guaranteed...

04:09.617 --> 04:11.316
(beat-boxing)
...Wi-in.

04:11.318 --> 04:14.653
So, I do nothing
and automatically win?
Yes.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.921
Nah.
Come on.
Name your price.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.957
Eight bucks,
and I get to eat in
front of the tv tonight.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.425
Deal.
Yeah!

04:20.427 --> 04:22.361
I love politics.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.395
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

04:23.397 --> 04:27.499
<i>♪ but nonetheless</i>
<i>I feel the need to say</i>

04:29.602 --> 04:30.569
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

04:30.571 --> 04:35.207
<i>♪ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i>clearer every day ♪</i>

04:36.509 --> 04:37.809
Adult adam:
<i>Back in the '80s,</i>

04:37.811 --> 04:39.344
<i>You couldn't just</i>
<i>lay on your couch</i>

04:39.346 --> 04:40.846
<i>And stream a movie</i>
<i>to your phone.</i>

04:40.848 --> 04:43.015
<i>You actually had</i>
<i>to spend an hour venturing</i>

04:43.017 --> 04:46.852
<i>To a wondrous place</i>
<i>called a video store,</i>

04:46.854 --> 04:48.954
<i>And it was awesome!</i>

04:48.956 --> 04:50.122
Let's just make
this fast, okay?

04:50.124 --> 04:53.925
Pick a movie, and don't go
behind the curtain!

04:53.927 --> 04:54.660
<i>The stakes were high.</i>

04:54.662 --> 04:56.862
<i>If someone already rented</i>
<i>the movie you wanted,</i>

04:56.864 --> 04:58.430
<i>You were out of luck.</i>

04:58.432 --> 04:59.364
No!

04:59.366 --> 05:01.400
<i>Temple of doom</i>
is checked out!

05:01.402 --> 05:03.268
Some putz
checked it out!

05:03.270 --> 05:04.303
Just pick any movie.

05:04.305 --> 05:06.305
Look,  <i>rhinestone.</i>
<i>Rambo sings in it.</i>

05:06.307 --> 05:10.175
Does rambo sing while
ripping a man's heart
out of his chest?

05:10.376 --> 05:10.909
Doesn't say.

05:10.911 --> 05:15.547
<i>When you were out</i>
<i>of options, there was</i>
<i>one last hail mary,</i>

05:15.549 --> 05:16.715
<i>The return bin.</i>

05:16.717 --> 05:17.816
<i>If your movie was in there,</i>

05:17.818 --> 05:19.251
<i>It was like</i>
<i>winning the lottery.</i>

05:19.253 --> 05:22.788
<i>At least for an obsessive</i>
<i>movie geek like me.</i>

05:23.523 --> 05:25.023
(gasps) yes!

05:25.025 --> 05:26.925
I am the luckiest
man alive!

05:26.927 --> 05:28.927
Yeah, we all
have our stories.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.863
Let's just get going.
Here's my card.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.599
<i>Temple of doom.</i>
Overrated.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.335
You want to see
a good film, kid,

05:36.337 --> 05:37.903
Watch bergman's,
<i>the seventh seal.</i>

05:37.905 --> 05:40.005
Or  <i>devil's manners,</i>
<i>that's my student film.</i>

05:40.007 --> 05:41.473
It's pretty much
the quintessential...

05:41.475 --> 05:44.042
No, thank you,
and let's get going.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.110
Uh, we're in a big rush.

05:45.112 --> 05:49.214
(computer beep)
yeah, you have a movie out.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.049
<i>Slap shot.</i>
Overrated.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.185
If you ask,
paul newman
should not...

05:53.187 --> 05:53.819
I did not ask you,

05:53.821 --> 05:56.154
And I know
I returned that movie.
Please check again.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.957
I didn't realize
that my computer
was hal 9000

05:58.959 --> 05:59.891
And it could change at will

05:59.893 --> 06:01.693
And blast us
out the pod bay doors.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.229
Nothing you say
makes any sense.

06:04.231 --> 06:08.633
Please check again
because I am 100% positive

06:08.635 --> 06:10.402
That I returned that movie.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.737
You guys lost it.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.739
Dad, I just want to
watch my movie.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.074
Okay, how much
do I owe you?

06:16.076 --> 06:17.042
To restore your account,

06:17.044 --> 06:19.845
You would have to purchase
the unreturned video.

06:19.847 --> 06:23.115
(beeping)
which would be $59.99.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.850
That's crazy!
I'm not paying that!

06:24.852 --> 06:27.452
Come on.
This is the only
video store in town.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.087
It's not like
we have a choice.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.889
We do have a choice!

06:30.891 --> 06:32.457
I am not leaving here

06:32.459 --> 06:37.462
Until you clear my account
and I get my justice.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.499
(typing)
(computer beeping)

06:40.501 --> 06:41.233
What are you doing?

06:41.235 --> 06:44.369
Just marking
<i>temple of doom</i>
<i>as in stock.</i>

06:44.371 --> 06:47.606
Let's get out of here.
Come on, now, now!

06:50.209 --> 06:52.944
Is mom here?
Yeah, she just got home.

06:52.946 --> 06:53.712
Damn it!

06:53.714 --> 06:56.615
Don't mind me.
Just go back to
your sandwich.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.649
Adult adam:
<i>In that moment,</i>

06:57.651 --> 06:59.684
<i>Pops saw that his sweet,</i>
<i>little granddaughter</i>

06:59.686 --> 07:02.354
<i>Was actually</i>
<i>a master of deception.</i>

07:02.356 --> 07:05.190
There's my beautiful mermaid.
How was swim class?

07:05.192 --> 07:08.960
Little emily goodman
finally put her face
in the water.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.762
Oh, you are
an inspiration.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.665
Thanks, mom.
I'm so proud of you.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.966
(erica sighs)

07:14.968 --> 07:18.103
"swim class,
Thursday the 27th.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.972
"emily goodman,
face in water."

07:20.974 --> 07:25.911
Uh-oh, I'm looking
at some pretty
shady stuff here,

07:25.913 --> 07:27.813
And I know shady.

07:27.815 --> 07:28.380
Okay.

07:28.382 --> 07:31.650
I'm gonna let you in
on a secret that's
so gigantic,

07:31.652 --> 07:34.753
That it could
rock this family
to its very core.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.588
Maybe I shouldn't...
Here it is.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.090
I've never taught a swimming
lesson in my entire life,

07:39.092 --> 07:40.992
I don't do model un.
Or meals on wheels

07:40.994 --> 07:43.295
And it feels so good
to finally tell someone!

07:43.297 --> 07:46.198
Wait.
You scammed your mom?

07:46.200 --> 07:46.865
That's very risky.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.968
How has she not been
at one of your
swim lessons?

07:49.970 --> 07:53.905
I specifically
chose the ymca pool
'cause she hates it.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.874
It's so humid,
it makes her hair frizz.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.176
And the model un. Thingy?

07:58.178 --> 07:59.511
I swore I'd quit
if she showed up,

07:59.513 --> 08:01.713
And she knows better
than to call that bluff.

08:01.715 --> 08:02.914
But how did you get
in the yearbook?

08:02.916 --> 08:05.283
<i>Turns out my</i>
<i>sister's desperation</i>

08:05.285 --> 08:08.353
<i>Spawned a new invention...</i>

08:08.355 --> 08:10.422
<i>The photo bomb.</i>

08:10.590 --> 08:14.125
(camera shutter clicking)

08:14.127 --> 08:16.394
And I thought
she was good.

08:16.396 --> 08:17.762
She is, but I'm better.

08:17.764 --> 08:21.333
And I have to be,
'cause if she ever finds
out, she'll kill us both.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.701
Why am I getting killed?

08:22.703 --> 08:24.135
'cause you're in
on it with me.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.103
Since when?

08:25.105 --> 08:26.872
Since I just told you!

08:26.874 --> 08:27.672
How did this happen?

08:27.674 --> 08:29.241
I just came here to have
a pastrami sandwich!

08:29.243 --> 08:32.878
You better come clean
with your mother
before she finds out.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.113
Or I fake-join
the debate club

08:35.115 --> 08:37.115
And create a whole
other level of lies!

08:37.117 --> 08:39.718
Thanks, pops!
You're the best!

08:41.888 --> 08:44.756
(gasps)
finally! There's my baby.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.425
(sniffs)
what's that weird smell?

08:47.427 --> 08:48.260
That's the smell of clean.

08:48.262 --> 08:51.229
You're free to start
reversing the process now.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.198
How was school?
Sweet!

08:53.200 --> 08:54.633
Fed a sea gull
a french fry.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.968
We're not near the ocean.
How do they get there?

08:56.970 --> 08:59.337
No, I was talking
about student council.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.972
Oh, that. Yeah.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.574
Not happening.
What?

09:02.576 --> 09:04.009
Michael rubenstone
is running now.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.778
You said this was
a guaranteed win and I
wouldn't have to try.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.614
That's what I'm good at.
Since when
is michael running?

09:09.616 --> 09:12.350
He's already got
a full plate.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.251
I'm okay with it,

09:13.253 --> 09:14.886
Mostly 'cause I
don't give a crap.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.154
You can beat
michael rubenstone.

09:16.156 --> 09:20.225
I mean, what has
he got that my
delicious boy doesn't?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.927
Cookies!
His mom made them,

09:21.929 --> 09:26.364
And they're the perfect mix
of chewy and crunchy.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.366
Mmm.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.068
Mmm.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.872
Oh, so we're baking
political cookies now, huh?

09:33.874 --> 09:36.942
You wanted war?
(chuckles)

09:36.944 --> 09:39.678
You've got it,
betsy rubenstone.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.580
(sighs)

09:42.281 --> 09:45.183
(bleep) that is good!

09:45.185 --> 09:45.850
Good morning, guys.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.919
Vote for michael.
Michael for treasurer.

09:47.921 --> 09:51.423
You guys know
michael, right?
Betsy rubenstone.

09:51.657 --> 09:53.525
We need to talk.
Beverly!

09:53.527 --> 09:57.262
Look at you pulling
off that outfit for
the most part.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.930
Cut the chitchat.
I'm on to you.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.133
You said michael
was too busy to
run for treasurer.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.001
Well, he found the time

10:03.003 --> 10:05.003
'cause he has a passion
for politics.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.004
No, he doesn't!

10:06.006 --> 10:06.838
All kids hate everything.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.140
He's only running
because you have it
out for me.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.809
Why don't I make michael
drop out of the race

10:10.811 --> 10:12.277
And give
poor barry the win?

10:12.279 --> 10:13.878
No! You leave michael in.

10:13.880 --> 10:17.549
I'm barry's
campaign manager now
and we will crush you.

10:17.551 --> 10:19.217
I'd love to see that.
Well, good luck.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.619
Good luck to you.
Don't need it.

10:20.621 --> 10:21.987
Neither do I.
Think you do.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.455
Think you do.
Do you?

10:23.457 --> 10:24.723
(softly) I do.
I don't.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.925
What?
Just kidding. I don't.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.093
Oh.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.227
<i>Things were really heating up</i>

10:29.229 --> 10:30.762
<i>Between my mom</i>
<i>and betsy rubenstone,</i>

10:30.764 --> 10:36.067
<i>While back home my dad</i>
<i>was about to lose his cool.</i>

10:36.069 --> 10:40.572
Murray: Oh, what did you do
with the tv guide?

10:40.773 --> 10:45.276
<i>My father had found the video</i>
<i>he swore he had returned.</i>

10:45.278 --> 10:45.844
(sighs)

10:45.846 --> 10:49.447
<i>So he did what any</i>
<i>honorable man would do.</i>

10:49.682 --> 10:52.117
<i>Hide the evidence.</i>

10:56.522 --> 10:57.622
What you doing?

10:57.624 --> 10:59.224
Nothing.
Is that  <i>slap shot?</i>

10:59.226 --> 11:02.560
Are you kidding me?
You swore you returned it.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.129
You said you were
100% positive!

11:04.131 --> 11:07.165
I've never been
100% positive about
anything in my life.

11:07.167 --> 11:11.269
Whatever! Let's just
end this stupid feud
and return the movie.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.604
Nope, dad is
gonna teach you

11:12.606 --> 11:15.674
A very valuable
life lesson here, okay?

11:15.676 --> 11:19.244
If you never admit
you're wrong,

11:19.246 --> 11:20.078
You're never wrong!

11:20.080 --> 11:22.947
Either you take that tape
back to the video store

11:22.949 --> 11:24.149
Or we got real problems, man!

11:24.151 --> 11:26.785
What are you getting at?
You know what I'm getting at!

11:26.787 --> 11:29.154
I really have no clue.
I don't either!

11:29.156 --> 11:31.189
Just return the tape!

11:34.994 --> 11:37.195
<i>As erica spun</i>
<i>her web of lies,</i>

11:37.197 --> 11:38.830
<i>Pops tried to avoid</i>
<i>getting caught in it.</i>

11:38.832 --> 11:41.533
Pops, pops, thank god.
Um, I need you to listen

11:41.535 --> 11:44.235
To this fake argument about,
uh, trickle-down economics

11:44.237 --> 11:46.771
In case mom asks me
about the debate team.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.507
You're writing speeches
for a debate

11:49.509 --> 11:50.341
You're not a part of?

11:50.343 --> 11:52.177
Yes, and we need to
make it good.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.845
No "we."
stop saying "we."

11:53.847 --> 11:55.980
"trickle-down economics
is a pejorative term

11:55.982 --> 11:57.782
"used by
liberal-media hacks."

11:57.784 --> 11:58.416
This is crazy!

11:58.418 --> 12:02.721
Wouldn't it just
be easier if you
actually did this stuff?

12:02.723 --> 12:05.724
I mean, it would look great
on the college resume.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.593
Oh, it would, but I can't.

12:08.894 --> 12:09.527
(sighs)

12:09.529 --> 12:12.363
I'm gonna let you in
on another huge secret.

12:12.365 --> 12:13.164
No!
Here it is.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.933
This is the opposite
of what I want.

12:14.935 --> 12:19.270
Back in freshman year
when I actually did model un,

12:19.272 --> 12:21.272
There was an incident.

12:21.274 --> 12:24.142
<i>It was my sister's</i>
<i>dark origin story.</i>

12:24.144 --> 12:25.410
<i>Back before erica was erica,</i>

12:25.412 --> 12:29.547
<i>She was an overachieving,</i>
<i>first-class stress case!</i>

12:29.549 --> 12:31.349
Senegal? Really?

12:31.351 --> 12:32.350
Their main export
is the peanut!

12:32.352 --> 12:36.087
If I'm getting
a country in africa,
I'm getting libya!

12:36.089 --> 12:37.455
Girl: Erica?
I am libya!

12:37.457 --> 12:39.124
Girl 2: Hey!
I've got every country now.

12:39.126 --> 12:40.091
Uh-huh,
that's right, patel!

12:40.093 --> 12:43.061
(indistinct shouting)
I declare a new world order!

12:43.063 --> 12:45.330
I was such a stress case
under so much pressure

12:45.332 --> 12:47.932
From mom, dad,
my teachers, everyone.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.502
So that's when I
started hanging out
with the popular kids.

12:50.504 --> 12:53.071
And you know what
they do after school?

12:53.405 --> 12:55.306
Nothing. They do nothing!

12:55.308 --> 12:57.976
They're never stressed-out,
so I quit all of it.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.211
But aren't you
just as stressed

13:00.213 --> 13:02.580
Trying to keep this
whole charade alive?

13:02.582 --> 13:03.348
Oh, yeah, it's way worse!

13:03.350 --> 13:06.551
Then just apologize
and go back to being
a weirdo again.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.686
I can't do that.
They hate me.

13:08.688 --> 13:13.558
Kiddo, sometimes you just
have to swallow your pride

13:13.560 --> 13:16.127
And ask for forgiveness.

13:17.663 --> 13:19.531
(bell dings)

13:19.533 --> 13:20.698
Well, what have we here?

13:20.700 --> 13:25.370
Just take the tape,
and I no longer
owe you $59.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.472
That is correct.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.008
(keyboard clacking)
you now owe me...

13:30.010 --> 13:32.410
(beep)
...$106.75.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.112
What are you
talking about?
That's crazy.

13:34.114 --> 13:40.185
Late fees, 61 days overdue
times $1.75, and let's see.

13:40.187 --> 13:43.388
Yes, definitely
a $2 rewind fee.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.023
Just give me
the movie.
No.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.425
Come on.
Give me the movie.
No.

13:47.593 --> 13:48.092
No!

13:48.094 --> 13:50.962
Okay, that's it.
I ban you from
video heaven.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.063
Oh, no, no, no!

13:52.065 --> 13:53.998
I ban you!
That's right!

13:54.000 --> 13:56.534
I am never coming
in here again ever!

13:56.536 --> 13:57.769
That's what I said.
(bell dings)

13:57.771 --> 14:01.673
And  <i>slap shot</i>
<i>is a great movie.</i>

14:02.675 --> 14:04.442
<i>While my dad</i>
<i>was losing his battle,</i>

14:04.444 --> 14:07.178
<i>My mom was determined</i>
<i>not to lose hers.</i>

14:07.180 --> 14:10.281
Hi. Uh, can I speak
to julianne crump, please?

14:10.283 --> 14:13.685
Hello, mrs. Stevens.
Is your daughter kelly there?

14:13.687 --> 14:15.887
Okay, your son kelly.
I'm sorry.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.021
Oh, you've already
committed your...

14:17.023 --> 14:19.357
Your vote to
michael rubenstone? Huh.

14:19.359 --> 14:24.229
Okay, what can I do
to convince you
to vote for barry?

14:25.164 --> 14:27.899
Yes, erica is single.
(door opens)

14:30.436 --> 14:31.769
What the hell is this?

14:31.771 --> 14:33.438
(gasps) surprise!

14:33.440 --> 14:36.174
Get it?
Vote for barry.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.909
Barry. Berry.

14:37.911 --> 14:38.476
Barry.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.079
They sound the same,
and you're both delicious!

14:41.081 --> 14:43.514
Mom. Kids like cookies!

14:43.516 --> 14:45.250
Why don't you just
bake some cookies?

14:45.252 --> 14:48.453
Because "cookie"
doesn't work with "barry."

14:48.455 --> 14:50.688
Well, this doesn't
work either!

14:50.690 --> 14:53.324
That's right!
I got berried!

14:53.326 --> 14:55.293
Ninth grade girls
threw them at me.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.794
There's supposed
to be a hierarchy.

14:56.796 --> 14:59.330
They ignored
the hierarchy!

14:59.332 --> 15:00.765
I quit.
You can't quit.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.334
We cannot lose this thing.
Not now, not ever.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.736
Why do you
even care so much?

15:04.738 --> 15:06.704
I don't care.
Do I look like I care?

15:06.706 --> 15:10.008
(scoffs)
look how casual I am.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.744
I don't want to be
stupid treasurer.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.012
Do you even know
what a treasurer does?

15:14.014 --> 15:19.150
A treasurer is one
of the most important
jobs a school has.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.552
You get to handle
all the money.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.288
So it does involve treasure.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.757
And you get to run
the student government

15:25.759 --> 15:27.525
When the president,
the vice president,

15:27.527 --> 15:30.028
And the secretary
all get sick.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.297
I want this job.
What do we have to do?

15:32.299 --> 15:33.531
You just keep
being delicious.

15:33.533 --> 15:37.302
Uh, let your campaign
manager deal with
all the nitty-gritty.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.637
Here's your speech.
Memorize it.

15:39.639 --> 15:40.772
Okay.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.907
But no more berries!
You have my word.

15:42.909 --> 15:47.078
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>there were no</i>
<i>berries in sight,</i>

15:47.080 --> 15:50.915
<i>But barry was everywhere.</i>

15:58.424 --> 16:01.759
Have you seen this?
This is so
freaking embarrassing.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.494
Oh, my god,
it's you.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.463
No, it's not.

16:06.165 --> 16:10.101
No. No, no, no.

16:10.769 --> 16:15.540
In what universe,
in what reality

16:15.542 --> 16:18.309
Would you think
this is even
a little bit okay?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.911
Just look at that
delicious face!

16:19.913 --> 16:24.115
That's a face
you want to eat.
And vote for.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.851
Fired! You're fired
as campaign manager!

16:26.853 --> 16:27.919
I have just fired you!

16:27.921 --> 16:29.620
You can't fire me.
I'm your mother.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.622
Then I fire you
as my mother!

16:31.624 --> 16:32.757
If you fire me
as your mother,

16:32.759 --> 16:34.058
Then I have failed
as a mother.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.159
Then you've failed
as a mother.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.362
How dare you say
I've failed
as a mother?

16:37.364 --> 16:40.098
You know what?
I bet that
betsy rubenstone

16:40.100 --> 16:41.899
Plastered posters
all over the school.

16:41.901 --> 16:44.335
If anyone failed as a mother,
it's probably her somehow.

16:44.337 --> 16:48.940
Wait, this was never
about me beating michael,
was it?

16:48.942 --> 16:51.209
It was about
you beating betsy!

16:51.211 --> 16:56.147
You always complain about
her being overbearing
and pushy.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.915
You're way worse.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.917
(poster drops)

17:02.121 --> 17:04.255
Adult adam:
<i>I was so excited</i>
<i>for my dad to get home,</i>

17:04.257 --> 17:07.025
<i>I could barely enjoy</i>
<i>my algebra homework.</i>

17:07.027 --> 17:10.194
What's in the bag?
Tell me it's  <i>indiana jones.</i>

17:10.196 --> 17:11.062
Even better.

17:11.064 --> 17:16.534
Who needs a movie
when you've got
a video-game-machine thing?

17:16.536 --> 17:17.168
(chuckles)

17:17.170 --> 17:18.803
Are you joking
with me right now?

17:18.805 --> 17:21.973
This is atari.
I have nintendo.

17:21.975 --> 17:23.141
There's a difference?

17:23.143 --> 17:25.276
Why are you giving me
misguided gifts?

17:25.278 --> 17:27.545
What happened
at the video store?

17:27.846 --> 17:29.981
We lost her, son.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.516
She's gone.

17:31.518 --> 17:32.950
I went in
with the best intentions,

17:32.952 --> 17:38.623
But things were said,
