WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:03.504
Previously on Limitless...
I've been thinking about

00:03.537 --> 00:04.605
the shooting.

00:04.638 --> 00:05.606
I was watching footage
of Morra.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.475
It's almost like he dodged.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.776
Do you think he's on NZT?

00:08.809 --> 00:10.744
Senator's coat. The real one.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.346
With NZT in the blood.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.381
Everything go smooth?

00:13.414 --> 00:14.615
BRIAN:
I had to talk to one guy

00:14.648 --> 00:15.649
in the evidence unit.

00:15.683 --> 00:16.784
REBECCA:
He's dead, Brian.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.519
He went to a Chinese restaurant

00:18.552 --> 00:19.520
where the chef knows about
his allergy.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.656
Somehow, peanut oil
ended up in his entree.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.425
He died in the ambulance.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.160
Do you think someone killed him?

00:26.194 --> 00:29.097
I think someone didn't want us
talking to him.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.032
(lively jazz music playing)

00:57.291 --> 00:59.560
WOMAN: You understand
you're giving a statement to IAU

00:59.593 --> 01:02.263
about your recent investigation
of Cyrillus Holdings?

01:02.296 --> 01:03.231
Mm.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.633
And that this also
includes the 48-hour period

01:05.666 --> 01:07.668
you spent working
with another agent.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.103
Look, I get it.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.771
You want me to talk
about Lucy Church.

01:10.804 --> 01:14.175
That works for me; I could talk
about Lucy Church all day long.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.810
And why is that exactly?

01:16.844 --> 01:19.180
Because...

01:19.213 --> 01:21.582
I learned a lot from her.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.585
Plus, I wasn't in a great place
when we met.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.158
You look like
you've been through hell.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.759
I know what you did.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.694
Jesse Escanso?

01:33.727 --> 01:35.229
The evidence clerk.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.199
He didn't just die
because someone

01:38.232 --> 01:39.833
put peanut oil
in his Chinese food.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.369
You made it happen.

01:41.402 --> 01:43.204
(whispers):
Which means I made it happen.

01:43.237 --> 01:46.507
Assuming you're right
about any of this...

01:46.540 --> 01:48.509
did you come here
to say thank you?

01:48.542 --> 01:50.544
Jesse Escanso
could have,

01:50.578 --> 01:52.580
and would have,
exposed everything

01:52.613 --> 01:54.248
that we're trying to do.

01:54.282 --> 01:57.418
And if he hadn't have had...
an accident...

01:57.451 --> 01:59.587
odds are, you'd be
in jail right now.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.754
I don't care.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.925
I don't, I don't
go around murdering people.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.428
And y haven't.

02:08.762 --> 02:09.963
You gave me a debriefing.

02:09.997 --> 02:15.169
Based on that, I may or may not
have tended to a loose end.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.438
What trouble is that
to your conscience?

02:21.642 --> 02:23.311
And Agent Harris?

02:24.778 --> 02:27.215
Well, I'd imagine the timing
of Mr. Escanso's death

02:27.248 --> 02:28.582
hasn't been lost on her.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.485
Rebecca's fine.

02:31.519 --> 02:34.255
You don't have to worry
about Rebecca.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.927
In any case,
she won't be getting

02:39.960 --> 02:43.564
any compromising information
from Jesse Escanso.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.537
WOMAN: You weren't in a great
place? What does that mean?

02:49.570 --> 02:51.705
Nothing you need to worry about.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.707
The stuff you want to know,
that all started

02:53.741 --> 02:55.909
when the list of
undercover agents got out.

02:55.943 --> 02:56.677
Finch!

02:57.945 --> 02:58.779
Get up!

02:58.812 --> 02:59.680
Ah, Mike!

02:59.713 --> 03:00.914
What is it, like,
3:00 in the morning?

03:00.948 --> 03:01.949
What do you want?

03:01.982 --> 03:04.918
Naz needs you right now.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.587
NAZ: Washington maintains
a master list

03:06.620 --> 03:09.890
of every agent working
under nonofficial cover.

03:09.923 --> 03:12.760
Two hours ago, unknown persons
stole the hard drive

03:12.793 --> 03:15.929
from Deputy Director Rovick's
home in Dupont Circle.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.531
The list was on it.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.633
Every undercover operation
we've got going

03:19.667 --> 03:21.402
has been compromised,
and we're pulling

03:21.435 --> 03:22.736
all the agents as we speak.

03:22.770 --> 03:23.771
Has the list been leaked?

03:23.804 --> 03:26.974
No, not yet. We only assume
it's a matter of time.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.108
NAZ:
This is Adrian Vescovi.

03:28.141 --> 03:31.379
He supervises undercover work
in the city, and, uh,

03:31.412 --> 03:33.381
he will fill you
in on the rest.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.683
At this point, we have no idea
what these thieves want.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.684
They could be selling
these names,

03:36.717 --> 03:38.752
they could post them publicly
at any moment.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.988
We have 22
undercover agents,

03:41.021 --> 03:43.857
five of which
are unaccounted for.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.727
Now, obviously, we have
our people looking for them.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.629
I hear you're quite
the problem solver.

03:48.662 --> 03:51.499
I want you and your team
to do everything you can

03:51.532 --> 03:52.800
to find these agents.

03:52.833 --> 03:53.834
These are their names.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.570
(quietly): Hear that?
He said my team.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.772
I heard. He's just
ignorant, that's all.

03:58.806 --> 03:59.807
VESCOVI:
...Liz Collette,

03:59.840 --> 04:04.812
Alex Nellenthal and Lucy Church.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.647
REBECCA:
Yes, I know Lucy.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.882
I knew her.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.452
Um...

04:11.485 --> 04:14.288
We were at
Quantico together, um...

04:14.322 --> 04:16.023
till she got
pulled pre-graduation

04:16.056 --> 04:19.327
for an undercover assignment.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.329
I heard it was at a prison.

04:21.362 --> 04:25.666
Um, and then she went into
another deep undercover position

04:25.699 --> 04:27.868
after that,
and then another one after that.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.870
So...

04:29.903 --> 04:31.439
That happens to some people.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.707
They get addicted
to being somebody else.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.346
I mean, the only thing
I know about undercover work

04:38.379 --> 04:39.847
is what I've seen in the movies,

04:39.880 --> 04:42.616
but, um, yeah,
once I dug into the files,

04:42.650 --> 04:44.818
finding the agents
really wasn't that hard.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.854
(lively jazz music playing)

04:46.887 --> 04:49.323
BRIAN: Agent Ben Yang was
deep cover with the Triads.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.759
Now, funny enough, the guy had
a sensitivity to MSG.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.661
Luckily, a lot of people
think there's a way

04:53.694 --> 04:56.330
to remedy MSG symptoms:
drink Red Bull.

04:56.364 --> 04:57.931
I tracked down a bodega-sized
Red Bull shipment

04:57.965 --> 05:00.501
to a Chinatown apartment
and found Agent Yang.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.102
Agent Liz Collette
was working undercover

05:02.135 --> 05:03.504
at a blue chip Chelsea gallery

05:03.537 --> 05:04.772
under suspicion
of moving stolen art.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.541
Now, here's the thing about
the art world: no one eats.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.042
And Agent Collette
filed receipts

05:09.076 --> 05:11.379
from a bunch of burger places
on her last assignment.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.013
We found her shame-eating
at a Shake Shack.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.048
It went on like that,
until the only agent

05:15.082 --> 05:16.817
left unaccounted for
was Lucy Church,

05:16.850 --> 05:18.919
who was in the end stages
of a long assignment

05:18.952 --> 05:19.953
at a corrupt hedge fund.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.022
This place apparently
cornered the market

05:22.055 --> 05:23.691
on high-end money laundering
in the city.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.459
It's tied to some
very bad people,

05:25.493 --> 05:27.828
and no one could get
in touch with Lucy.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.830
Which was how
I came to be standing

05:29.863 --> 05:31.799
in the middle of Ditmars
Boulevard right before dawn,

05:31.832 --> 05:34.668
looking for a blue
1968 Ford Mustang.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.840
(tires screeching)

05:40.841 --> 05:42.810
I recognize the name.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.812
The face does nothing for me.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.414
I'm Brian Finch.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.715
I work with the FBI.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.417
Look, your cover's burnt,

05:49.450 --> 05:52.820
and your boss, Adrian Vescovi,
says you need to come in.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.954
How did you find me?

05:53.987 --> 05:55.423
You had speeding tickets.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.657
You're an insomniac,

05:56.690 --> 05:59.092
and driving fast late at night
helps you relax.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.961
I took a bet that
once you had a badge,

06:00.994 --> 06:03.096
you'd just use it
to get out of tickets.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.698
So, we sent people
to the five longest

06:04.732 --> 06:05.799
straightaways in the city.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.442
I picked the longest one.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.308
Here we are.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.977
All right,
so someone took the list,

06:17.010 --> 06:18.846
but it hasn't been posted
publicly yet.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.181
Yeah, well,
not as far as we know.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.484
Thanks for the heads-up,
Brian Finch.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.818
I'm not coming in.
Oh, come on.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.887
No, wait, wait, wait!

06:26.920 --> 06:29.022
(tires screeching)

06:34.628 --> 06:35.663
What's your deal?

06:35.696 --> 06:36.530
What do you mean?

06:36.564 --> 06:38.065
I mean, you're cute enough

06:38.098 --> 06:39.700
to pull off
the whole square-jaw thing,

06:39.733 --> 06:41.602
if you wanted to,

06:41.635 --> 06:42.402
but you're dressed
like you're in line

06:42.436 --> 06:43.370
for the Porta-John
at Coachella.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.173
They woke me up
in the middle of the night.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.841
Doesn't matter;
the Bureau wouldn't let you

06:47.875 --> 06:49.543
get away with that unless
you were something special.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.611
So...

06:50.644 --> 06:51.912
what's your deal?

06:51.945 --> 06:53.714
I solve problems.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.152
I am well supplied with those.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.921
And, as of a couple minutes ago,

07:00.954 --> 07:05.158
I haven't got a whole lot of
time to sort through them, so...

07:05.192 --> 07:07.461
Oh, you want me
to come with you?

07:07.495 --> 07:09.797
I joined the Bureau
to save lives.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.632
Could be you had
different reasons.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.166
I know you're manipulating me.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.536
And yet you're
still standing there.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.009
(tires screeching)

07:24.812 --> 07:26.480
I stood on the road
for 12 hours

07:26.514 --> 07:29.583
before somebody told me
they found Lucy.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.652
I'm not complaining
about the windburn, per se,

07:31.685 --> 07:33.086
but it would be nice
if the Bureau

07:33.120 --> 07:35.656
could reimburse me
for some aloe.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.692
*

08:00.080 --> 08:01.615
(laughs)
Kidnap him?

08:01.649 --> 08:05.252
You're asking me if I kidnapped
the CJC's consultant?

08:05.285 --> 08:08.589
I opened the car door;
he got in on his own.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.224
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

08:12.726 --> 08:15.663
(car horns honking)

08:17.798 --> 08:18.966
BRIAN:
Hey, do you want me

08:18.999 --> 08:20.901
to dial for you so you can
focus on the road?

08:20.934 --> 08:23.036
I got to call my boss.
Try and be quiet a sec, okay?

08:23.070 --> 08:25.205
(line ringing)

08:25.238 --> 08:27.207
VESCOVI:
Lucy, you're on speakerphone

08:27.240 --> 08:29.176
with myself and
S.A.C. Pouran.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.578
Is everything okay?

08:30.611 --> 08:32.145
I'm not coming in, Adrian.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.146
Not yet.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.582
Uh, actually, you are.

08:34.615 --> 08:35.916
I'm pulling
your credentials right now.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.551
Any arrest you make

08:37.585 --> 08:38.919
will be null and void.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.120
All right, you could do that.

08:40.153 --> 08:43.557
I mean, I wouldn't, seeing as
I'm the one holding the file

08:43.591 --> 08:44.792
that can tie Cyrillus Holdings
to, like,

08:44.825 --> 08:46.226
50 criminal counts.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.829
Don't even start down this road
with me, Lucy.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.632
I get pulled in, who's to say
what happens to that file?

08:51.665 --> 08:53.033
Lucy, we're done.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.101
This case is over.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.670
We have everything we need
to nail the hedge fund.

08:56.704 --> 08:59.172
No, there is one more thing
before we file charges, Adrian,

08:59.206 --> 09:00.774
and you know
how important it is.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.542
Don't pretend like you don't.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.146
Two days.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.949
I'm giving you two days
to bring this thing home.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.117
Fine.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.352
I'm borrowing a man-child
from the CJC.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.121
I'll bring him back in better
shape than I found him.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.122
Shouldn't be hard.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:15.155 --> 09:15.989
(phone beeps)

09:17.190 --> 09:18.692
Did you just
hang up on Naz?

09:18.726 --> 09:19.793
Buckle up, handsome.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.294
You're mine for
the next two days.

09:21.328 --> 09:24.732
BOYLE: W-Was I surprised
Finch stayed out in the field?

09:24.765 --> 09:27.267
Of course not.

09:27.300 --> 09:30.370
He probably heard the word
"undercover,"

09:30.403 --> 09:33.807
and with that expression
that means exclamation point.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.142
(ding)

09:35.175 --> 09:37.244
Undercover.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.245
(ding)

09:38.278 --> 09:40.280
Hey, I like this place.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.818
I was in the endgame
at Cyrillus Holdings--

09:44.852 --> 09:45.653
three years of casework.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.921
Technically,
the investigation is done.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.957
Just one last piece
needs to fall into place.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.258
Help me out.
Yeah.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.028
So, this last piece,

09:55.062 --> 09:56.997
is that what
we're after?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.335
"The Blue Limit."

10:02.369 --> 10:05.238
Bills itself out
as a premium escort service.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.742
They launder all their cash
through Cyrillus Holdings.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.378
Okay, I'm listening.

10:11.411 --> 10:15.415
Good, because the FBI
believes what they really are

10:15.448 --> 10:17.284
is a human trafficking
organization.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.418
They bring in women

10:18.451 --> 10:20.654
from poor countries in Europe,
take their passports,

10:20.688 --> 10:21.989
and essentially sell
them into slavery.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.191
But doesn't that mean
that they'll just get

10:24.224 --> 10:26.694
rolled up in the larger
investigation of Cyrillus?

10:26.727 --> 10:27.627
The second

10:27.661 --> 10:29.730
we file a case
against Cyrillus Holdings,

10:29.763 --> 10:30.998
that case will encompass

10:31.031 --> 10:34.101
The Blue Limit, and every
other shady business

10:34.134 --> 10:35.903
they've ever worked with.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.706
At which point,
the women working there

10:38.739 --> 10:41.074
will become major liabilities.

10:41.108 --> 10:45.078
You think The Blue Limit would
be inclined to get rid of them?

10:45.112 --> 10:46.446
Women who make trouble there

10:46.479 --> 10:50.217
have a way of disappearing,
so, yeah, I do think

10:50.250 --> 10:52.152
that could happen
on a larger scale.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.288
I want to get these women
out of there.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.991
I want to find out where
their passports are stashed,

10:58.025 --> 11:00.093
get them back,
so they can be on their way home

11:00.127 --> 11:01.895
before charges get filed.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.031
It's not enough
these guys

11:04.064 --> 11:07.067
get to go to some
golf-farm white-collar prison.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.202
They're slavers.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.005
They kill women,
and I want them for that.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.842
Now, these guys keep
the particulars

11:14.875 --> 11:17.077
of their organization
pretty close to the belt,

11:17.110 --> 11:21.448
so there was only so much
that I could learn.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.316
But I had an informant
on the inside.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.452
We were just starting to get
a sense of the structure

11:25.485 --> 11:27.420
when she disappeared
a few weeks ago,

11:27.454 --> 11:30.724
which makes me think
they had her killed.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.793
Well, what can I do?

11:32.826 --> 11:36.063
Tonight, The Blue Limit
is holding a benefit,

11:36.096 --> 11:37.464
courting their
new high-end clients.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.800
You're coming as
one of the clients-to-be.

11:39.833 --> 11:43.103
I will make entry,
and we will work the room

11:43.136 --> 11:45.138
and find those passports.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.307
Just like that?

11:47.340 --> 11:50.210
Do you have a suit?
Have you ever even worn a suit?

11:50.243 --> 11:52.212
I got a suit.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.246
It's red.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.351
Okay.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.820
Personal shopper at Bergdorf's.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.354
He'll hook you up.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.489
Chop chop, Brian Finch.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.724
Lots of work to do.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.329
(phone chimes)

12:09.362 --> 12:10.931
BRIAN:
Hey there.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.400
Looking to save lives--
thumbs up emoji.

12:13.433 --> 12:17.137
Kind of need some NZT to do
it-- arm making muscle emoji.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.540
(sighs)

12:20.573 --> 12:23.443
Yes, I authorized
administering Brian NZT

12:23.476 --> 12:25.412
while he was
working with Lucy Church.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.214
Her handler made a strong case

12:27.247 --> 12:28.982
for why she should
still be out there.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.317
Brian Finch knew the parameters

12:30.350 --> 12:32.185
of what he was
and wasn't supposed to do,

12:32.219 --> 12:34.855
and I trusted him
to act within those.

12:36.289 --> 12:39.492
And, yes, in retrospect,
I realize that may sound naive.

12:41.494 --> 12:44.397
The women of Eastern Europe
thank you.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.799
You okay?

12:45.833 --> 12:47.134
You seem a little distracted.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.938
I got a call from Jarrod Sands'
office this morning.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.272
Remember him?

12:52.305 --> 12:55.142
What? I don't like
where this is headed.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.410
He, uh, heads up Senator Morra's
personal security.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.947
Yeah, I think so.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.148
Well, he wants to meet later.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.515
Are you gonna go?

13:02.549 --> 13:05.152
Well, we're sniffing around
Senator Morra and NZT,

13:05.185 --> 13:06.286
and all of a sudden

13:06.319 --> 13:07.420
I get this call
out of the blue?

13:07.454 --> 13:08.555
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.191
The, um...

13:11.224 --> 13:14.394
suit that you're wearing, it
still has a tag on the sleeve.

13:14.427 --> 13:17.130
Oh, yeah, I know.
I'm-I'm still shopping.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.132
I actually told the guy
that was helping me inside

13:19.166 --> 13:20.233
that I'd be right back.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.912
REBECCA:
He looked fine.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.314
Um, good, I guess.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.083
It was a nice suit.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.484
Everybody looks better
in a suit.

13:37.517 --> 13:41.088
Boy, that's a-a weird question
for you to ask me.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.857
WOMAN: I meant, did Finch
seem nervous or out of sorts?

13:43.891 --> 13:45.392
Oh, no, no.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.627
But, I mean,
I wasn't looking that closely.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.098
I... I had a lot on my mind
that day.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.734
Special Agent Harris.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.938
I'm glad you decided to come.
Do you fancy a drink?

13:57.971 --> 13:59.239
Oh, no, I'm good.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.642
This is a nice place.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.946
Senator Morra was impressed
by your deft handling

14:05.979 --> 14:08.015
of his attempted assassination.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.116
So was I.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.918
Well, I'm glad I could help.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.085
And we were glad

14:12.119 --> 14:13.086
for that help.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.054
So glad, in fact, that we would

14:14.087 --> 14:16.990
like to extend the relationship,
if possible.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.491
Extend it how?

14:18.525 --> 14:22.262
Senator Morra and I would like
to offer you a job.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.033
A job?
Mm.

14:26.066 --> 14:29.136
A quite lucrative one at that,

14:29.169 --> 14:32.239
working on the senator's
private security team.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.676
I'm gonna write a number
on a piece of paper.

14:36.709 --> 14:41.548
When you see it,
I'm sure you'll be convinced

14:41.581 --> 14:43.283
about how serious we are

14:43.316 --> 14:45.385
to have you
on our team.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.456
Naturally, all comes
with perks and privileges

14:49.489 --> 14:53.260
such as to dwarf anything the
FBI might be able to offer.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.134
As I said,

15:01.168 --> 15:04.237
we're quite serious.

15:04.271 --> 15:08.241
That's a very impressive offer,
Mr. Sands.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.412
May I have some time
to think about it?

15:12.445 --> 15:13.413
Of course.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.315
Take whatever time you need.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.650
Thank you.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.522
(phone vibrating)

15:25.125 --> 15:26.726
(exhales)

15:26.759 --> 15:28.128
Brian.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.729
I take it you've been
trying to reach me.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.065
Sands, listen to me,
I don't have much time...

15:32.099 --> 15:33.333
Relax, Brian.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.168
I'm not trying
to threaten or encroach

15:35.202 --> 15:37.070
in any other way upon Rebecca.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.139
Since you have failed utterly

15:39.172 --> 15:41.108
to convince her
to stop asking questions,

15:41.141 --> 15:43.010
I've simply stepped in
to smooth things over.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.411
How are you doing that?

15:44.444 --> 15:45.678
By offering her a job.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.214
Quite an attractive one,
in fact.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.215
What?

15:48.248 --> 15:49.716
You're trying to bribe her?

15:49.749 --> 15:50.717
Brian,

15:50.750 --> 15:53.453
I have yet to meet a human being
on this planet

15:53.486 --> 15:55.188
who doesn't have a price.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.506
Sure you're up for this?

16:13.540 --> 16:15.608
Totally.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.745
Brian, this is
years of my life,

16:18.778 --> 16:22.082
hundreds of hours of work.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.983
I am absolutely good to go.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.755
Okay.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.564
(lively jazz music playing)

16:44.737 --> 16:46.806
BRIAN: It wasn't my first
douchey hedge fund party,

16:46.839 --> 16:49.109
but it was the first where
just about every guy there

16:49.142 --> 16:51.578
was there specifically
to buy time with women.

16:51.611 --> 16:55.182
They ran a pretty wide gamut
of occupations and interests.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.584
There was the investment
bankers, inevitably.

16:57.617 --> 17:01.121
Kind of the easiest to impress,
since they live by speculation.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.090
Because trading
on the open market is dead

17:03.123 --> 17:04.291
when it comes to derivatives.

17:04.324 --> 17:07.160
The Sharpe ratio isn't even
comparable with dark pools.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.495
I mean, no market depth feed,

17:08.528 --> 17:11.098
risk becomes
a virtual non-entity.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.600
And go ahead, call your clients,
take this down.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.302
The Russian oligarch contingent

17:15.335 --> 17:17.404
was a tougher nut to crack,
but it seemed relevant

17:17.437 --> 17:19.172
since a lot of the girls
were Eastern European.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.573
But it turned out
to be worth it,

17:20.607 --> 17:22.442
since that way I was able
to meet Sergei,

17:22.475 --> 17:24.277
The Blue Limit's man in charge
on the ground,

17:24.311 --> 17:26.313
and he had issues of his own
he needed help with.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.515
You know, it sounds to me
like your nephew's just trying

17:28.548 --> 17:30.150
to get your brother's attention.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.084
Cry for help?

17:31.118 --> 17:33.286
Exactly, that's exactly right.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.687
I mean, think of it
like this, Sergei.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.089
You put a kid like that

17:36.123 --> 17:38.625
on a Ducati, he's just
gonna ride around

17:38.658 --> 17:41.428
knocking driver side mirrors
off to get a rise out of Dad.

17:41.461 --> 17:45.798
But if Dad takes away the Ducati
and actually listens to him...

17:45.832 --> 17:48.335
I'm sure he has not
thought of it quite this way.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.636
Well, he totally should.

17:49.669 --> 17:50.637
Nostrovia.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.771
Nostrovia.

17:51.804 --> 17:52.972
BRIAN:
With every little exchange,

17:53.005 --> 17:56.476
every snippet of conversation
I was able to pick up,

17:56.509 --> 17:58.311
I gradually was able
to build a sense

17:58.345 --> 18:00.780
of The Blue Limit's hierarchy.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.883
And in every vaguely
threatening e-mail chain,

18:03.916 --> 18:06.253
every overheard reference
to discipline,

18:06.286 --> 18:08.555
there's one name
that keeps recurring.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.123
Karl Boorman.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.191
(whispers):
Thank you.

18:11.224 --> 18:11.991
I know the name.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.660
Head of security
for The Blue Limit.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.662
Yeah, he oversees the dirty
work when it needs doing.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.564
Stands to reason that he'd
be the person holding

18:17.597 --> 18:20.167
the passports of all
Blue Limit's workers.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.470
Get to him, we make
this thing right. Boom.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.572
Okay. Not bad.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.274
"Not bad." Come on.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.742
Frankly, I didn't bring you here
with high hopes.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.478
You managed to not
totally screw it up

18:31.511 --> 18:34.881
and you gained some useful
intel, so, yeah, not bad.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.284
Please, you stay.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.286
Oh, I'm sorry, we were
just about to leave.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.788
Sergei sends me over.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.490
To say thank you for helping

18:43.523 --> 18:45.292
with his nephew.

18:45.325 --> 18:48.561
There is a suite
waiting upstairs.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.863
Very comfortable.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.599
(chuckles)

18:52.632 --> 18:53.900
I'm sorry,
I'm with someone.

18:53.933 --> 18:54.901
That's okay.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.304
Sergei knows that.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.805
She can come, too.

18:58.838 --> 18:59.639
Yes?

19:01.974 --> 19:04.611
I mean, what were
we supposed to do?

19:04.644 --> 19:07.814
You know, Sergei is not the kind
of guy you want to say no to.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.517
It was... awkward.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.620
But we worked something out.

19:19.426 --> 19:21.828
I love to watch.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.535
Feel free to
raid the mini-bar.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.403
Cool.

19:30.437 --> 19:33.940
Of course, we didn't have sex
with the Russian escort.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.675
We just thought
it would look suspicious

19:35.708 --> 19:40.447
to send her back to Sergei,
so we waited out the two hours.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.683
Luckily, Irina loves TV.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.386
So You Think You Dance,

19:46.419 --> 19:48.788
Yes to the Dress,

19:48.821 --> 19:50.557
Amazing Races,

19:50.590 --> 19:52.225
MythBusters.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.760
Though, it's their last season.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.228
It's very sad.

19:55.262 --> 19:56.229
(TV playing)

19:56.263 --> 19:57.730
Well, we got what we came for.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.966
Karl Boorman
has the passports.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.834
It's a good night's work.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.636
We can relax-- a little.

20:05.272 --> 20:08.775
Unless, of course, you'd rather
spend the time with, uh...

20:08.808 --> 20:10.643
(Brian laughs)

20:10.677 --> 20:14.714
You know, I'm actually not
a reality TV fan myself, so...

20:14.747 --> 20:16.549
Really?
Yeah.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.717
Seem like the type.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.453
She really loves it.

20:20.487 --> 20:22.689
(Irina laughs)

20:22.722 --> 20:25.458
Well, she's lucky.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.394
She's premium product,

20:27.427 --> 20:31.398
so she gets treated
with a degree of humanity.

20:31.431 --> 20:34.734
Some of the others who maybe
aren't so beautiful...

20:34.767 --> 20:38.571
It's human trafficking for
the purpose of sexual slavery.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.541
That's why she's so happy
to be watching TV.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.545
All right, now...

20:45.578 --> 20:48.881
how about you tell me
what's bothering you.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.784
(sighs)

20:51.818 --> 20:54.987
Well, there is a situation,

20:55.021 --> 20:57.957
but I can't really talk
about it.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.527
Come on, who can you
talk to, if not me?

21:00.560 --> 21:02.862
A girl you have
absolutely no ties to,

21:02.895 --> 21:04.564
probably never see me again.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.534
Have you ever killed someone?

21:09.569 --> 21:10.870
Have you?

21:10.903 --> 21:12.439
I think so.

21:12.472 --> 21:16.376
I didn't actually do it,
it was something I said.

21:16.409 --> 21:19.078
Unless you ordered a hit,
that's not on you.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.514
You can't control people.

21:21.548 --> 21:22.815
My advice?

21:22.849 --> 21:24.851
Don't dwell on it.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.887
One of the best feelings
is when I get a new case,

21:27.920 --> 21:30.056
and I can just leave
the old one behind,

21:30.089 --> 21:31.791
along with everything
that went with it.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.894
That all sounds...

21:36.696 --> 21:38.665
...kind of okay.

21:38.698 --> 21:39.866
Good.
Yeah.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.568
I need you in character.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.069
I got a job for you tomorrow.

21:51.778 --> 21:54.914
(lively jazz music playing)

21:54.947 --> 21:57.550
I mean, there's all kinds
of undercover gigs, you know.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.619
Sometimes it's really badass

21:59.652 --> 22:00.987
and there's parties
and hot girls

22:01.020 --> 22:04.791
and stuff like that,
and sometimes...

22:04.824 --> 22:05.892
BOYLE:
Was I sorry

22:05.925 --> 22:09.762
when I heard Finch had
to go back to being a temp?

22:09.796 --> 22:14.033
To sitting in a cubicle
and filing papers all day?

22:14.066 --> 22:15.735
Yeah.

22:15.768 --> 22:18.405
My heart bled for him.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.440
The Blue Limit
has a vested interest

22:20.473 --> 22:21.808
in appearing legitimate.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.076
Meaning they get short-staffed,

22:24.110 --> 22:26.679
they hire a temp,
just like anyone else.

22:26.713 --> 22:30.116
So Lucy called
every temp agency in New York

22:30.149 --> 22:32.552
to see if they had made
any requests that morning,

22:32.585 --> 22:34.587
and the next thing we knew...

22:34.621 --> 22:36.556
It was like riding a bicycle.

22:36.589 --> 22:37.990
I was a very convincing temp.

22:38.024 --> 22:41.694
And after one more NZT pill,
maybe too convincing.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.963
It was a bet that nobody
working low-level data entry

22:43.996 --> 22:45.732
was at the VIP party
last night,

22:45.765 --> 22:48.835
but we were willing
to take those odds.

22:48.868 --> 22:52.004
And as long as I had data
to enter, nobody bothered me.

22:52.038 --> 22:55.408
And I could keep an eye out
for anything unusual.

22:55.442 --> 22:56.876
Like that guy in the suit,

22:56.909 --> 23:00.012
and that secure door
he keeps disappearing behind.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.015
Though security is
a relative term, of course.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.752
If you listen carefully,
every key makes

23:05.785 --> 23:07.754
a slightly different sound
when you press it.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.989
It's kind of like
learning a song.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.024
(keypad clicking, beeping)

23:16.095 --> 23:19.599
And would you look at that?
It's already time for lunch.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.634
(keypad clicking, beeping)

23:25.037 --> 23:27.507
What are they hiding in here?

23:28.808 --> 23:30.877
Huh. Guess it's a little more
secure than I thought.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.144
But with a little help
from a few

23:32.178 --> 23:33.646
instructional videos
on YouTube,

23:33.680 --> 23:35.448
I was able to crack the safes.

23:35.482 --> 23:37.183
(safe clicking)

23:38.518 --> 23:40.119
First two safes
weren't much help,

23:40.152 --> 23:41.488
but on the last one...

23:41.521 --> 23:43.089
(slot machine chiming)

23:44.123 --> 23:46.593
Jackpot.

23:54.801 --> 23:57.036
Going on the lam?

23:57.069 --> 24:01.040
If I were a Latvian brunette
by the name of... Svetlana.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.509
I do like that name.

24:02.542 --> 24:05.011
What exactly are
you doing, then?

24:05.044 --> 24:07.847
Well, I got all the passports
back, as you can see.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.181
You're welcome,
by the way.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.751
I meant with the cash.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.920
Well, I started thinking
about what's next.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.655
I mean, we're helping
all these women

24:15.688 --> 24:17.189
get out and go home,

24:17.223 --> 24:18.925
but to what?

24:18.958 --> 24:20.893
A lot of them
only ended up here because

24:20.927 --> 24:23.530
they thought it would be better
than what they had before.

24:23.563 --> 24:26.032
So, I want to make sure

24:26.065 --> 24:28.034
they have more
options this time.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.938
LUCY:
This is thousands of dollars.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.507
Where did you get this money?

24:34.541 --> 24:36.809
I mean, getting the passports
back didn't take very long,

24:36.843 --> 24:38.811
so I stopped by
the horse races.

24:38.845 --> 24:41.981
I read up on a few of the
ponies, got a little lucky,

24:42.014 --> 24:44.150
and went home
with a bit of cash.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.285
Just a little
something to help

24:46.318 --> 24:48.254
get them back
on their feet.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.825
Remind me to take you
to Vegas next time.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.260
That's not all
I found, though.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.828
With the passports,

24:55.862 --> 24:57.630
there were all these ledgers.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.566
Now, it's mostly really
boring accounting stuff.

24:59.599 --> 25:00.900
Except...

25:00.933 --> 25:03.836
do you know anything
about "Edelweiss"?

25:03.870 --> 25:06.573
I was in The Sound of Music
in high school.

25:06.606 --> 25:07.574
Okay, so,

25:07.607 --> 25:09.909
"Edelweiss" seems to be
some kind of code name.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.911
It's all over the place
in these ledgers,

25:11.944 --> 25:13.580
and whoever or
whatever it is,

25:13.613 --> 25:16.716
it was getting payouts
from The Blue Limit,

25:16.749 --> 25:19.852
designed specifically to be
crazy complicated and nearly...

25:19.886 --> 25:20.987
BOTH:
Impossible to trace.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.288
Exactly.

25:23.322 --> 25:25.124
We need to find Edelweiss.

25:25.157 --> 25:27.159
I had the exact same thought.

25:30.362 --> 25:34.266
This is Queens,
and this...

25:34.300 --> 25:37.003
is Edelweiss.

25:37.036 --> 25:39.606
Whose official name of record is
the German Hospitality League,

25:39.639 --> 25:42.274
supposedly some
cross-cultural goodwill club.

25:42.308 --> 25:45.812
And the recipient of
record for payouts

25:45.845 --> 25:47.146
from the magical
mystery fund.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.915
That's a front.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.850
This place is less than
a mile from here.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.819
And I figure that if we go
over there in the morning,

25:52.852 --> 25:54.987
we'll find whoever's been
killing the women

25:55.021 --> 25:56.656
for The Blue Limit.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.899
That wasn't the reaction
I expected.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.802
Well, I was...

26:09.836 --> 26:12.204
really impressed.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.974
With the research
or with the kiss?

26:17.677 --> 26:18.945
WOMAN:
And?

26:18.978 --> 26:20.379
And what?

26:20.412 --> 26:22.815
No, we had some laughs,
no big deal.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.386
S-Seriously, I-I don't...

26:27.419 --> 26:29.388
I don't know
what you want me to say.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.058
That's-that's the end
of the story. We just...

26:32.091 --> 26:34.861
(lively Indian music playing)

26:46.338 --> 26:48.307
*

26:56.015 --> 26:57.884
I'm sorry, where were we?

26:57.917 --> 26:59.919
I lost my train of thought
a little bit.

27:04.423 --> 27:07.359
So, after two days of strictly
professional collaboration,

27:07.393 --> 27:09.996
we had the address of the guy
The Blue Limit was paying

27:10.029 --> 27:12.331
to murder women,
including Lucy's source,

27:12.364 --> 27:14.400
but we ran into a problem.

27:14.433 --> 27:16.635
(phone ringing, vibrating)

27:18.437 --> 27:19.906
Hey.

27:19.939 --> 27:22.742
REBECCA: 48 hours are up.
It's time to come home.

27:22.775 --> 27:23.743
What?

27:23.776 --> 27:25.011
They're cutting you off.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.245
Wait, what do you mean?

27:26.278 --> 27:30.382
Dispensary isn't issuing any
more NZT until you come back.

27:30.416 --> 27:33.052
I need you
for one more thing.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.289
Look, I really want to see
this case through.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.258
I'm not ready to come back in.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.293
You hooked up, didn't you?

27:41.327 --> 27:42.294
You and Lucy.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.295
What?

27:43.329 --> 27:45.965
No, that's... Come on.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.434
We didn't... Bollywood.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.435
That's crazy.

27:49.468 --> 27:50.937
Why would you even suggest that?

27:50.970 --> 27:52.138
Fine, I don't even care.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.306
You want to work
the case off NZT,

27:54.340 --> 27:55.441
work the case off NZT.

27:55.474 --> 27:56.909
I'll even run interference,

27:56.943 --> 27:58.444
but you're the one
that has to answer to Naz.

27:58.477 --> 28:00.112
Thank you, seriously.
And we didn't...

28:00.146 --> 28:01.147
(phone beeps)

28:03.750 --> 28:06.886
All right,
what's this assignment?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.321
(tires screech)

28:09.355 --> 28:11.357
(lively jazz music playing)

28:13.760 --> 28:16.996
WOMAN: Hold on. Is this the part
with the kidnapping?

28:17.029 --> 28:18.731
Kidnapping-light, okay.

28:18.765 --> 28:21.033
It's, like, kidnapping adjacent,
if you can even call it that,

28:21.067 --> 28:22.068
which you can't, by the way,

28:22.101 --> 28:24.036
because the kidnapped party
ultimately agreed

28:24.070 --> 28:25.972
to the arrangement.

28:26.005 --> 28:28.507
BRIAN: In order to discover
who killed Lucy's informant,

28:28.540 --> 28:30.209
we needed to know
who worked there.

28:30.242 --> 28:31.510
Now, I didn't have any NZT,

28:31.543 --> 28:33.379
so about an hour
prior to my arrival,

28:33.412 --> 28:35.181
I had my hacker buds
at Everywhere

28:35.214 --> 28:37.183
dump a Denial-of-Service virus

28:37.216 --> 28:39.218
onto the German Hospitality
League server

28:39.251 --> 28:40.452
to crash its Wi-Fi,

28:40.486 --> 28:43.022
forcing a call
for outside tech support.

28:43.055 --> 28:46.225
And, yes, a little minor-league
kidnapping might have ensued.

28:46.258 --> 28:47.726
Hey!

28:49.028 --> 28:51.764
Lucy hooked up the Data dude
with a couple of hundred bucks

28:51.798 --> 28:53.365
and a gift card
for a taco place in Greenpoint.

28:53.399 --> 28:54.767
He'll be all right.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.235
Tech nerds love guacamole.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.838
All I had to do was get
a picture, maybe a name,

28:58.871 --> 29:00.306
and we could build a case.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.074
I didn't need a pill for that.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.375
Still, it's kind of
nerve-wracking.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.244
There is a stone-cold killer
working here.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.779
Hi-ya.

29:07.546 --> 29:08.781
You here about the Wi-Fi?

29:09.816 --> 29:11.417
Okay, let's see here.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.919
Oh, you got the old setup.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.921
Here we go.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.923
You sure
you've done this before?

29:16.956 --> 29:18.791
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I do this all the time.

29:18.825 --> 29:22.261
I could honestly do this...
in my sleep.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.463
'Cause I sleepwalk,
sometimes, so...

29:24.496 --> 29:27.266
It's-it's called, um...
somnambulism.

29:27.299 --> 29:29.135
I stalled for
as long as I could.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.871
I couldn't get the receptionist
to talk about her boss.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.940
She just said he was
rarely there.

29:33.973 --> 29:36.142
Any luck?

29:36.175 --> 29:37.343
Uh, you know what,

29:37.376 --> 29:39.345
I think you guys
might need a new, uh,

29:39.378 --> 29:42.348
that-that rabbit ear thing,
what's it called? Router?

29:42.381 --> 29:45.017
Hey, maybe I'd better
call your office

29:45.051 --> 29:47.153
to see if they can
send along someone

29:47.186 --> 29:50.556
more, uh, confident.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.892
Oh.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.493
Oh, I mean, o-okay.

29:54.526 --> 29:57.163
You know, that's-- I understand.

29:57.196 --> 29:59.231
Try to give 110%
every time.

29:59.265 --> 30:01.267
I do apologize
about this.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.935
It's just, uh, you know,

30:02.969 --> 30:04.971
sometimes these things are
a little more complicated

30:05.004 --> 30:06.038
than they seem.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.974
Just tell them, um...

30:08.007 --> 30:09.375
I gave it my all.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.310
The magazine gave me a name.
From there, it wasn't

30:11.343 --> 30:13.212
gonna be hard to get
a picture of the guy.

30:13.245 --> 30:15.114
Lucy is gonna be psyched.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.248
Son of a bitch.

30:16.282 --> 30:18.117
MAN (over TV): Our source
confirms that the list of

30:18.150 --> 30:21.854
active undercover agents
within the FBI was exposed

30:21.888 --> 30:23.522
when computer hackers
stole the intelligence,

30:23.555 --> 30:25.524
and began horse trading
on the black market.

30:25.557 --> 30:26.926
I'm burned.

30:26.959 --> 30:27.927
For real.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.128
I know.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.196
No, you don't.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.598
Because of this, the claim
against The Blue Limit

30:32.631 --> 30:34.934
will go public before
we can even build a case

30:34.967 --> 30:36.302
against Gudmund Friedrich.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.470
And by then,
he'll be in the wind.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.073
You can still bring down
Cyrillus Holdings.

30:41.107 --> 30:42.641
The escort service
will get rolled in...

30:42.674 --> 30:43.509
There's a guy out there.

30:43.542 --> 30:46.612
He pulled the trigger
on my informant,

30:46.645 --> 30:49.048
a bunch of other women.

30:49.081 --> 30:51.217
There's no way
he walks from this.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.252
We have to get Friedrich
before the FBI does.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.853
What are you going to do?

30:55.687 --> 30:57.323
We got to go.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.690
It's not safe here anymore.

30:58.724 --> 31:01.627
REBECCA: No, I did not drive out
personally to bring Brian in.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.362
That seems to be
what you're getting at.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.497
WOMAN:
Just asking questions.

31:05.531 --> 31:07.499
What happened at
Edelweiss was a disaster.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.700
A disaster?

31:08.734 --> 31:11.603
I could think of a few words
I would use before that one.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.239
I was busy. I had casework.

31:13.272 --> 31:16.042
I had a meeting to get to,
totally unrelated.

31:20.146 --> 31:24.250
I appreciate your interest
in me, sincerely, and...

31:24.283 --> 31:26.252
if you're willing to accept
the terms of my counter,

31:26.285 --> 31:27.586
I think we can wrap this up.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.555
And the terms are?

31:38.965 --> 31:41.000
I did some research.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.668
Before you went
to work for Senator Morra,

31:42.701 --> 31:43.970
there were a few holes

31:44.003 --> 31:45.137
in your resume.

31:45.171 --> 31:48.307
A diplomatic posting here,
six months in Africa there.

31:49.741 --> 31:53.212
But you were MI-6.

31:53.245 --> 31:57.183
How much did Morra pay
to take you away from the SIS?

31:57.216 --> 32:00.419
If you already
learned this much...

32:02.354 --> 32:04.623
...you know there's no chance
I can answer that question.

32:06.192 --> 32:09.461
And I hardly see what it has to
do with the present negotiation.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.697
This isn't a negotiation.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.966
One of two things is happening.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.734
Either you're genuinely
interested in me,

32:15.767 --> 32:17.536
in which case,

32:17.569 --> 32:20.172
thanks, but no thanks.

32:20.206 --> 32:22.441
I like catching the bad guy.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.043
Kind of my thing.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.245
And the second possibility?

32:26.278 --> 32:28.414
Someone at the FBI
has been telling you about

32:28.447 --> 32:30.582
the questions I've been asking.

32:33.285 --> 32:36.022
If Senator Morra is using NZT...

32:36.055 --> 32:38.224
if he is connected to the purges
that wiped the pills

32:38.257 --> 32:39.625
off the streets two years ago,

32:39.658 --> 32:41.693
it's gonna take
more than a buyout

32:41.727 --> 32:43.729
to keep me from the truth.

32:45.431 --> 32:49.068
That's a strong position
you're staking out.

32:49.101 --> 32:53.105
I take it you've got concrete
evidence to back those claims.

32:53.139 --> 32:55.607
I am just getting started.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.221
Do you think Friedrich
will show?

33:09.255 --> 33:11.257
I told his receptionist

33:11.290 --> 33:13.392
we're raiding The Blue
Limit in an hour.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.627
I guarantee he keeps
a cash horde here.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.496
He'll come here
or she'll go to him.

33:17.529 --> 33:18.764
And then what?

33:18.797 --> 33:21.167
We got the list of the payouts.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.069
Let's see how easy he scares.
Hmm.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.371
He's either the guy or he's
the guy leading to the guy,

33:25.404 --> 33:27.506
but one way or another,
he's gonna talk to me.

33:27.539 --> 33:30.242
Hmm.

33:30.276 --> 33:33.712
It's just hitting me.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.748
My face is out there.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.785
I can never go
undercover again.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.420
My career's dead.

33:41.453 --> 33:44.022
Won't the FBI give you
another job?

33:45.624 --> 33:48.260
If I wanted to work
as Lucy Church,

33:48.294 --> 33:51.097
I would've done that
a long time ago.

33:51.130 --> 33:54.100
I don't even know if I can
go back to being her.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.402
It's not her.

33:56.435 --> 33:57.503
It's you.

33:59.105 --> 34:00.639
I guess.

34:05.544 --> 34:06.512
BRIAN:
That's him.

34:06.545 --> 34:07.513
Yup.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.148
Do you want to call
for backup?

34:09.181 --> 34:10.816
For what? We don't have
enough to arrest him.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.184
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

34:12.218 --> 34:13.785
What if you can't scare him
into a deal?

34:15.621 --> 34:17.456
You should go back
to the CJC, Finch.

34:17.489 --> 34:18.590
No, no way, not now.

34:18.624 --> 34:22.128
I have no idea how it's
gonna go down in there, Brian.

34:22.161 --> 34:24.196
You look tired.

34:24.230 --> 34:27.099
I can tell. You've lost your...
spark or something,

34:27.133 --> 34:28.367
and this guy
is really dangerous.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.835
Look, you're not wrong, okay?

34:29.868 --> 34:31.537
But I'm not letting you
go in there alone.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.439
So either take me
or I call it in

34:33.472 --> 34:35.641
and the FBI swarms this place,
and that's that.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.276
(sighs)

34:39.745 --> 34:41.380
You've taken a
TAC course, yeah?

34:41.413 --> 34:42.548
I've had training.

34:42.581 --> 34:43.815
You're loaded,
one in the chamber.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.584
You know what to do
if we get into trouble.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.386
Uh, is there
a safety on the...?

34:47.419 --> 34:49.821
Safety's your finger.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.290
Right.

34:51.323 --> 34:54.460
Uh, and, Brian...

34:54.493 --> 34:56.128
don't shoot me.

34:56.162 --> 34:57.663
Let's go.

35:06.238 --> 35:08.474
I consult with
The Blue Limit.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.876
This is proof of nothing.

35:10.909 --> 35:14.346
This is just
the point of the spear.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.248
This will be easy.

35:17.649 --> 35:18.550
You describe your dealings

35:18.584 --> 35:20.786
with The Blue Limit's
trafficking operation.

35:20.819 --> 35:23.755
You give us Karl Boorman
and Sergei,

35:23.789 --> 35:27.626
and you can count on
a certain measure of leniency.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.695
And believe me,
I have enough evidence

35:29.728 --> 35:31.897
to bury your ass
for the rest of your life.

35:31.930 --> 35:35.434
You are very convincing.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.868
Hardly surprising.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.205
You've been lying for years.

35:39.238 --> 35:41.607
It's a simple binary choice.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.410
A little cooperation or
the rest of your life in prison.

35:44.443 --> 35:47.446
If you had what you say,
I'd already be under arrest.

35:48.947 --> 35:51.217
You'd have brought
more than this...

35:51.250 --> 35:52.684
haircut for backup.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.254
The Blue Limit will fall,

35:55.287 --> 35:57.189
but I do not work
at The Blue Limit.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.592
You tried.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.328
You failed.

36:02.361 --> 36:03.362
Go home.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.335
Lucy, what are you doing?

36:09.368 --> 36:14.306
Now it's my turn to make
a simple binary choice.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.943
I bring your ass in
and I take my chances,

36:17.976 --> 36:22.448
or I serve justice
right here, right now.

36:23.849 --> 36:27.486
Probably not too hard to figure
out which way I'm leaning.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.463
Lucy, come on,
you don't want to do this.

36:37.496 --> 36:40.466
You are so very wrong
about that.

36:40.499 --> 36:42.434
This is why you shouldn't
have come, Brian.

36:42.468 --> 36:43.669
You shouldn't see this.
You know what?

36:43.702 --> 36:45.237
Then that's exactly
why I should be here.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.239
Because if you
do this, it's over.

36:47.273 --> 36:47.973
You go to prison.

36:48.006 --> 36:48.974
Only if you tell.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.309
I will tell.

36:50.342 --> 36:51.377
And that's your career
and your life

36:51.410 --> 36:53.379
and all the women
that you helped on this case.

36:53.412 --> 36:56.315
And for what? For him?

36:56.348 --> 36:58.984
Listen, I can prove
that Friedrich

36:59.017 --> 37:01.253
is tied to
The Blue Limit's escorts.

37:01.287 --> 37:02.654
How?
I don't know yet.

37:02.688 --> 37:05.591
I still need time,
but this can end well.

37:05.624 --> 37:08.527
As far as I'm concerned,
it's just about to.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.996
Lucy, I'm gonna have
to tell the FBI,

37:11.029 --> 37:12.598
unless you're gonna
kill me, too,

37:12.631 --> 37:13.465
and the receptionist,

37:13.499 --> 37:15.501
and anyone else
who might happen along.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.969
If he makes bail, he'll be
on the next plane to Dusseldorf

37:18.003 --> 37:19.471
and we'll never see him again.

37:19.505 --> 37:20.706
To hell with that.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.442
Yesterday, were talking
about how people die

37:23.475 --> 37:25.777
in this line of work and
you're not responsible,

37:25.811 --> 37:28.614
even though you can't help
but feel a part of it.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.318
If you pull this trigger,
you are responsible,

37:32.351 --> 37:33.619
and you can't get
away from that.

37:33.652 --> 37:34.620
That is you.

37:34.653 --> 37:35.754
That is you forever.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.656
Listen to me,
I will back up

37:37.689 --> 37:40.526
any story you want,
but not if you kill him.

37:40.559 --> 37:43.762
I can't do that.
I won't do that.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.666
Fine.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.369
(screams)

37:50.402 --> 37:51.370
Oh, what did you do?

37:51.403 --> 37:53.539
(panting)

37:53.572 --> 37:55.273
Not walking out of here now.

37:58.977 --> 38:00.979
All right,
we got work to do, boys.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.118
BRIAN:
Actually, I was able to prove

38:07.152 --> 38:10.055
the whole thing even before
Friedrich got out of surgery.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.690
And once they started
making arrests

38:11.723 --> 38:13.692
at Cyrillus Holdings
and The Blue Limit,

38:13.725 --> 38:16.695
we found tons of takers
willing to corroborate

38:16.728 --> 38:18.630
Friedrich's role
in exchange for immunity.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.699
I mean, you haven't seen
a lack of backbone

38:20.732 --> 38:23.802
until you've questioned a bunch
of guys from a hedge fund.

38:23.835 --> 38:27.573
Frankly, I-I'm at
a total loss.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.708
I-I don't know whether
to take you into custody

38:29.741 --> 38:32.511
or simply fire you
for obstruction of justice.

38:32.544 --> 38:35.447
You have Gudmund Friedrich
on three counts of Murder One.

38:35.481 --> 38:40.085
Lucy, this isn't the first
complaint of insubordination.

38:40.118 --> 38:43.088
In undercover work,
the ends justify the means.

38:43.121 --> 38:46.692
And if they don't,
you find a way to justify them.

38:46.725 --> 38:48.360
Isn't that what you taught me?

38:51.096 --> 38:53.399
Is it true you gave Brian Finch
a loaded firearm?

38:55.734 --> 38:57.436
What the hell
were you thinking?

38:57.469 --> 38:59.838
I was thinking I had
a pretty good partner.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.673
Didn't want to see
him get killed.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.809
And Friedrich's story
about Lucy shooting him

39:03.842 --> 39:05.477
in cold blood?

39:05.511 --> 39:08.514
I mean, this is a guy
who murders women for a living.

39:08.547 --> 39:10.148
Who you gonna believe?

39:10.181 --> 39:11.717
NAZ: Well, this
certainly isn't over.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.052
There will be
a full after-incident

39:14.085 --> 39:15.987
investigation with IAU.

39:16.021 --> 39:19.391
So, everyone,
get ready for camera.

39:22.528 --> 39:24.062
WOMAN:
The preliminary investigation

39:24.095 --> 39:26.532
indicates the barrel
of Agent Church's pistol

39:26.565 --> 39:29.134
was pressed directly
against Friedrich's knee.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.902
It seems odd
that that would happen

39:30.936 --> 39:32.971
during the course
of a struggle.

39:33.004 --> 39:37.876
Well, Lucy, or, um...

39:37.909 --> 39:39.911
Agent Church, rather,

39:39.945 --> 39:42.514
she put me in harm's way.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.516
Like, I could've been killed.

39:44.550 --> 39:47.519
What possible reason
would I have to lie for her?

39:49.921 --> 39:52.524
Hey.

39:52.558 --> 39:55.594
You're... Seriously?

39:56.628 --> 39:58.196
I wrote, "See ya later."

39:58.229 --> 40:00.031
You know,
I always use sticky notes

40:00.065 --> 40:01.199
to build really cool stuff,

40:01.232 --> 40:03.702
and now you have
tainted them forever

40:03.735 --> 40:06.538
with your sad... sadness.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.540
Okay.

40:08.574 --> 40:11.543
It says, "later," not "never."

40:11.577 --> 40:13.845
So... later.

40:13.879 --> 40:16.615
Lucy, um...

40:18.484 --> 40:19.885
I got to tell you
something about me.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.086
All right?
I don't care.

40:21.119 --> 40:22.521
Uh, you what?

40:22.554 --> 40:25.524
I know. There's a drug,
it's complicated.

40:25.557 --> 40:26.558
I don't care.

40:27.626 --> 40:30.529
Drug or no drug,
I know who you are.

40:30.562 --> 40:31.730
I like who you are.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.999
I don't want you
to become like me.

40:34.032 --> 40:36.468
Compartmentalizing everything.

40:37.836 --> 40:40.238
It'd be a shame,
stripping away pieces

40:40.271 --> 40:43.675
of the kind of guy
who spends an afternoon

40:43.709 --> 40:45.477
playing the ponies
for a bunch of women

40:45.511 --> 40:46.745
he's never even met.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.058
SANDS:
Is it done?

41:02.728 --> 41:05.664
Ugh, what is
this crap?

41:05.697 --> 41:07.232
Paper plane.

41:07.265 --> 41:08.266
(chuckles)

41:08.299 --> 41:09.501
You say so.

41:10.536 --> 41:12.137
Keener?

41:14.606 --> 41:15.607
KEENER:
It's done.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.844
Full treatment.

41:22.548 --> 41:24.115
If she whispers her grocery list
in her sleep

41:24.149 --> 41:26.685
with the radio on, you'll know
how many cucumbers she needs.

41:26.718 --> 41:29.054
She, uh...

41:29.087 --> 41:31.122
she looked familiar.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.892
You knew her father.

41:37.295 --> 41:40.532
What about the other option?

41:40.566 --> 41:42.668
I see a window of opportunity?

41:42.701 --> 41:45.070
Take it.

You know that lady
from Real Housewives?

42:04.890 --> 42:06.892
She said she wasn't there
to make friends,

42:06.925 --> 42:09.728
but you know what?

42:09.761 --> 42:12.564
I think she was there
to make friends.

42:12.598 --> 42:13.932
IRINA: I think
she's a very lonely person.
