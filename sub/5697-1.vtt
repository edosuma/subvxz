04:43.932 --> 04:46.367
"Dangerous Dan"
is gonna tell you a secret.

04:46.767 --> 04:50.670
I love Christmas!

04:50.770 --> 04:52.437
There, I said it.

04:52.537 --> 04:55.042
And I don't care who knows it
'cause I love tinsel,

04:55.142 --> 04:58.976
I love Rudolph, I love cranberries,
I love baby Jesus!

04:59.076 --> 05:02.556
Before he went all hippy
with the sandals and long hair.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.781
What?

05:04.881 --> 05:08.349
No, no, no, no, no, Susan,
I'm gonna talk about Jesus on the radio.

05:08.449 --> 05:12.083
And you know why? Because it's his birthday
tomorrow, am I right, folks?

05:12.183 --> 05:17.253
Speaking of reminders, it's almost time
for the big charity food drive

05:17.353 --> 05:18.921
at the mall this afternoon.

05:19.021 --> 05:22.643
Our very own weatherman of action,
Stormin' Norman

05:22.743 --> 05:27.438
is gonna be down there helping out
like the true Christmas angel he is.

05:32.131 --> 05:35.836
Norman, is there any truth to the rumor
that a very special guest

05:35.936 --> 05:38.958
is gonna be making an appearance
at the food drive?

05:40.971 --> 05:42.738
Norman?

05:43.652 --> 05:48.641
Oh, hey Norman, he's writing me
a little Christmas card.

05:48.741 --> 05:50.797
This is exciting.

05:51.109 --> 05:53.466
What's it gonna say?

05:57.281 --> 06:01.742
Norman. Susan, did you see that?
You know who saw that?

06:02.351 --> 06:06.587
Jesus saw that!
And his dad. He saw that.

06:07.287 --> 06:09.688
All right, folks, looks like...

06:09.788 --> 06:11.950
Norman's hitting the trail, so...

06:12.050 --> 06:15.625
we'll just get this Christmas party
started without him!

06:15.725 --> 06:18.827
Yes, sir! We're gonna share the spirit.

06:19.427 --> 06:21.296
We're gonna deck some halls!

06:21.396 --> 06:26.466
I'm gonna get Susan under the mistletoe
and you, my little elves,

06:26.566 --> 06:29.033
you're gonna listen to one
of my favorite songs.

06:29.133 --> 06:31.501
So here's to the season!

06:31.601 --> 06:33.833
Here's to you...

06:33.933 --> 06:36.742
Bailey Downs.

06:41.812 --> 06:46.284
Let's get this Christmas party
started right.

06:54.819 --> 06:59.344
- Girlfriend's late.
- Impossible, we use protection.

07:00.223 --> 07:02.859
Made the mistake of watching this
alone last night,

07:02.959 --> 07:06.315
but nobody can know I have this, okay?

07:08.195 --> 07:12.930
<i>December 25th. Time, 13:26 hours.</i>

07:13.030 --> 07:15.766
<i>Constable Scott Peters,
conducting a preliminary walkthrough.</i>

07:16.166 --> 07:18.067
I used to babysit his son, Will.

07:18.167 --> 07:21.356
<i>Handprints on the wall.
Make sure you get that.</i>

07:24.803 --> 07:27.160
<i>A lot of blood in here.</i>

07:33.975 --> 07:36.777
<i>Victim's a male, Caucasian, late teens.</i>

07:36.877 --> 07:39.946
- <i>Possibly a student here.</i>
- Oh, boy.

07:40.046 --> 07:44.882
<i>Body showing signs of obvious staging
suggesting a ritualistic killing.</i>

07:45.915 --> 07:48.987
<i>Time and cause of death
to be determined by autopsy.</i>

07:49.752 --> 07:52.309
<i>Got some writing on the wall over here.</i>

07:53.188 --> 07:56.545
<i>"For unto us a child is born.</i>

07:56.957 --> 07:59.492
<i>Unto us a son is given."</i>

07:59.592 --> 08:00.894
Look at that.

08:00.994 --> 08:03.428
<i>Possible bible passage?</i>

08:03.528 --> 08:05.518
I don't know.

08:06.964 --> 08:09.020
<i>Me either.</i>

08:09.131 --> 08:11.354
What do you hear?

08:16.270 --> 08:19.194
Scott, what are you hearing?

08:19.672 --> 08:23.224
<i>Poor baby... wakes</i>

08:23.643 --> 08:26.486
<i>The little Lord Jesus</i>

08:26.586 --> 08:29.234
<i>No crying he makes...</i>

08:30.966 --> 08:34.102
- Fuck!
- <i>Christ!</i>

08:34.481 --> 08:36.485
Okay.

08:36.585 --> 08:39.650
Why was that cop singing that song?

08:39.751 --> 08:45.054
No one knows, he went on stress leave
after this and doesn't talk about it.

08:45.154 --> 08:49.457
Okay, and you still wanna go down there
just for some stupid school assignment?

08:49.557 --> 08:54.538
Man up, Dylan. We obviously
can't use the police video, so...

08:54.638 --> 08:56.516
we have to get our own footage.

08:57.729 --> 08:59.518
Hey, babies.

09:08.704 --> 09:10.749
- You're late, bitch.
- Sorry.

09:10.849 --> 09:14.497
Dad pulled this family trip
out of his ass like an hour ago.

09:16.510 --> 09:20.602
Merry Christmas. It'll get you through
any door in the school.

09:21.447 --> 09:25.483
- I love you so much right now.
- Caprice, I can't believe you actually got them.

09:25.583 --> 09:29.307
That's my honey.
Stickiest fingers in Bailey Downs.

09:39.894 --> 09:41.896
Gotta go.

09:41.996 --> 09:44.086
Don't get busted.

09:50.435 --> 09:52.903
Come on, we got a long drive.

09:58.408 --> 10:01.959
Christmas Eve and you wanna drive
to see your old aunt,

10:02.059 --> 10:05.014
- who as far as I know, doesn't even like you.
- She doesn't like anyone.

10:05.114 --> 10:07.383
Fine, but you're dragging us
along with you.

10:07.483 --> 10:11.306
You know what, and I expect everyone
to be on their best behavior.

10:14.453 --> 10:18.090
We're not in Saint Barth's for Christmas,
that's fine, or even Aspen, that's...

10:18.190 --> 10:21.546
Okay, look, I just wanted
to have some bonding time.

10:22.091 --> 10:25.777
You hear that, I want this
to be a happy, loving family.

10:25.877 --> 10:28.621
So you want a Christmas miracle.

10:37.602 --> 10:40.620
All right, son, let's get that tree.

10:42.572 --> 10:44.629
It's cold out here?

10:45.574 --> 10:47.109
I want the new Morph Machine.

10:47.209 --> 10:50.911
The Morph Machine with the motorcycle
and the guy has a green vest.

10:51.011 --> 10:53.801
Not the blue one, the other guy
with the Morph Machine.

11:01.800 --> 11:05.085
You okay? We can go back if you want.

11:05.185 --> 11:08.109
- I'm okay.
- He'll be fine, he'll be fine.

11:14.492 --> 11:15.960
Not here.

11:16.060 --> 11:20.063
What do you mean not here?
Baby, look at those.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.466
Tell me you will find
the perfect Christmas tree.

11:22.566 --> 11:26.235
- We can go right through here.
- Great, nice example for a cop, Scott.

11:26.335 --> 11:30.103
We're in the middle of nowhere.
No one's gonna even know we're here.

11:30.203 --> 11:31.959
Come on.

11:32.938 --> 11:34.794
Come on!

11:35.806 --> 11:37.646
Right behind you, son.

11:41.643 --> 11:44.155
Come on, don't be scared.

11:49.283 --> 11:51.688
Quit groping her, let's get on with it.

11:53.453 --> 11:55.343
Thanks.

11:55.788 --> 11:59.589
Five, four, three...

12:01.859 --> 12:05.360
Christmas, usually a time
of joy and celebration,

12:05.460 --> 12:08.496
but for Saint Joseph's Academy,
a time of mourning.

12:08.596 --> 12:12.501
Exactly one year ago last Christmas Eve
this school was the scene

12:12.601 --> 12:15.462
of an unimaginable crime
when two of its students,

12:15.562 --> 12:21.125
Connor and Jenna, seen here,
were found murdered in cold blood.

12:21.225 --> 12:24.310
With the killer still at large,
the atmosphere here in Bailey Downs

12:24.410 --> 12:26.938
is truly grim this holiday season.

12:27.038 --> 12:31.580
I'm Molly Simon, and this
is <i>Horror in the Hallways.</i>

12:31.680 --> 12:33.703
- Wait, cut.
- What?

12:33.803 --> 12:36.084
Are we really going
with that cheesy title?

12:36.184 --> 12:39.325
Your opinion would mean a lot more to me
if you weren't failing Media Arts.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.149
Hold on guys, I think I hear something.

12:46.524 --> 12:49.759
- I'm fine!
- Shit.

12:49.859 --> 12:51.543
It's Principal Harod.

12:51.643 --> 12:54.528
We just need to be careful.

12:54.628 --> 12:57.622
Yes, I... I know!

12:58.177 --> 13:00.573
Lis... listen to me!

13:04.368 --> 13:07.392
Go, go, go, go!
No, not that one, the other one.

13:08.237 --> 13:10.193
Molly, hurry up.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.717
Wait.

13:17.778 --> 13:20.589
Never mind, now I'm getting jumpy.

13:22.981 --> 13:24.082
Principal Harod.

13:24.182 --> 13:26.218
What the hell is he doing here
on Christmas Eve?

13:26.318 --> 13:27.973
Keep it down!

13:35.992 --> 13:38.794
- Great.
- I've got flashlights.

13:38.894 --> 13:42.317
- Oh, nice.
- Come on, it's this way.

14:13.122 --> 14:17.714
She better remember us in the will.
It's about time she invited us here.

14:18.593 --> 14:22.196
- She did invite us, right?
- Think of it as a Christmas surprise.

14:22.296 --> 14:25.653
- Taylor!
- 'tis the season. She'll be thrilled.

14:40.043 --> 14:42.500
You see, the thing is...

14:42.678 --> 14:47.382
To be honest, Aunt Etta,
I know you and mom had difficulties

14:47.482 --> 14:52.127
and I just thought we could, you know,
get it out there and deal with it.

14:52.227 --> 14:56.188
- Dear, maybe now's not a good time.
- It's Christmas, what could be a better time?

14:56.488 --> 15:00.691
Christmas is all about forgiveness
and family and tradition.

15:00.791 --> 15:04.908
If you just believe, if you let
that spirit in, it just... it fills you.

15:05.008 --> 15:07.267
Don't touch that!

15:09.764 --> 15:12.121
It's very old.

15:16.736 --> 15:18.783
Is there some place more private
you and I could talk?

15:18.883 --> 15:21.960
I wanna show you something
I think you might be interested in.

15:23.739 --> 15:25.495
Come.

15:31.679 --> 15:34.966
Four hours in the car and the old bat
doesn't even offer me a drink.

15:35.066 --> 15:37.536
I'll help myself, thank you.

15:38.381 --> 15:39.522
Look at this place,

15:39.622 --> 15:43.098
it's like Paul Bunyan and Count Dracula
gayed up and built a dream home.

15:45.286 --> 15:47.309
That is not a toy.

15:48.304 --> 15:51.380
- Oh, hi there, we're the...
- I know who you are.

15:52.590 --> 15:53.990
Okay.

15:54.090 --> 15:57.059
- This is Krampus, right?
- What's a Krampus?

15:57.159 --> 16:00.878
He's like an anti-Santa Claus,
a demon who punishes the naughty.

16:00.978 --> 16:05.118
He whips them, chains them up,
throws them in a sack, stuff like that.

16:05.218 --> 16:10.821
When Krampus knocked, the demon
hunts the wicked from sunset to sunrise.

16:11.321 --> 16:13.322
That's fun.

16:13.422 --> 16:17.024
He comes for little boys
who touch things they shouldn't.

16:17.124 --> 16:18.814
Oops.

16:20.814 --> 16:24.663
- Duncan!
- That was very unwise.

16:24.763 --> 16:28.032
We will pay for it, of course.
Pick it up.

16:28.132 --> 16:31.518
- Gerhart, what have you done?
- I did nothing.

16:31.618 --> 16:35.793
The boy had... an unfortunate accident.

16:37.772 --> 16:41.943
- Take your family and leave now.
- No, let's not be hasty here.

16:42.043 --> 16:45.040
No, my son,
I feel one of my spells coming

16:45.140 --> 16:50.365
and I cannot entertain guests. Goodbye.

17:01.021 --> 17:05.959
Bicycle parts to Sector Five!
Organs sets to arrive!

17:06.059 --> 17:08.048
Video games...

17:08.325 --> 17:11.147
Get out of the way, get out of the way!

17:18.665 --> 17:21.367
Have to take it out again this year.

17:22.435 --> 17:26.159
- Talk to the Mrs., Sparkles.
- Santa, I need your signature.

17:27.304 --> 17:28.640
Thank you.

17:28.740 --> 17:31.008
So what are we up against
this year, Jingles?

17:31.108 --> 17:33.443
Blizzard warning along
the Eastern seaboard.

17:33.543 --> 17:36.145
Never met a blizzard that troubled me.

17:36.245 --> 17:38.566
- It's bad, it's really bad.
- Another signature here.

17:38.666 --> 17:41.313
- I'm worried about the trade winds.
- Trade winds.

17:41.413 --> 17:43.749
- Safety first, Santa.
- Right here on the left.

17:43.849 --> 17:47.839
Lots of kids are depending
on tonight going off without a hitch.

17:50.053 --> 17:51.875
Shiny?

17:53.788 --> 17:56.457
- Take a break, everyone!
- Yay, Mrs. Claus!

17:56.557 --> 17:59.024
Even Christmas magic
needs a little fuel.

17:59.124 --> 18:00.927
- Oh, cookies!
- Smells good.

18:01.027 --> 18:03.316
- Cookies!
- What is this?

18:03.661 --> 18:07.051
- Have a cookie, Shiny.
- No, I...

18:07.663 --> 18:10.799
I don't know. No thank you.

18:10.899 --> 18:13.230
It'll keep your strength up
for the long shift.

18:13.330 --> 18:15.356
I'm not hungry.

18:15.704 --> 18:17.947
Not hungry? They're cookies!

18:18.047 --> 18:21.393
You're being silly, Shiny, you know
how much you love my cookies.

18:22.505 --> 18:26.109
I said I don't want a goddamn cookie!

18:26.209 --> 18:29.199
You reindeer fucking snow whore!

18:30.446 --> 18:32.335
Shiny!

18:51.329 --> 18:53.219
He...

18:53.530 --> 18:55.398
He's dead.

18:55.498 --> 18:57.633
Dead? But elves...

18:57.733 --> 19:02.211
Can't die.
Santa, elves can't die, right?

19:03.736 --> 19:07.126
No. They cannot.

19:12.908 --> 19:15.177
Yeah, he's gonna help
his pop put this up too.

19:15.277 --> 19:18.146
This tree is way better
than the ones at the mall.

19:18.246 --> 19:21.614
- We did it.
- Stop, we can't do this again.

19:21.714 --> 19:23.247
Oh, no way.

19:23.347 --> 19:27.537
They won't even miss it.
They got enough trees around here.

19:33.467 --> 19:37.193
Look at this, babe, this is a perfect tree.
Smells like pine, you love pine.

19:37.293 --> 19:40.295
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't think
it's gonna fit up the stairs.

19:40.395 --> 19:43.101
Of course it will,
it'll be fine, trust me.

19:48.033 --> 19:52.058
- Where's Will?
- He was right here with us. Will?

19:53.170 --> 19:54.738
- Will?
- Will!

19:55.738 --> 19:57.307
- Baby!
- Come on, we gotta go!

19:57.407 --> 20:01.051
- This ain't time to play hide and seek now!
- Where are you, babe?

20:03.656 --> 20:06.917
- We gotta go, come on, son!
- Will!

20:13.584 --> 20:16.170
- Come on, boy, stop playing, we gotta go!
- Where are you, baby?

20:16.270 --> 20:18.125
Mom?

20:19.721 --> 20:21.257
- Come on, honey, let's go!
- William, where are you?

20:21.357 --> 20:23.246
Dad!

20:28.128 --> 20:31.096
- William!
- Where are you?

20:31.496 --> 20:32.752
Will!

20:34.731 --> 20:36.832
Where'd he go?

20:36.932 --> 20:39.021
Couldn't have gone far.

20:40.834 --> 20:43.491
- Over here.
- Oh, God.

20:43.903 --> 20:45.859
Will!

20:47.522 --> 20:49.312
Baby?

20:49.774 --> 20:52.112
This way, through here.

20:52.212 --> 20:54.048
Son!

20:54.910 --> 20:56.766
Will!

20:58.045 --> 20:59.935
Will!

21:00.447 --> 21:02.270
Will!

21:03.382 --> 21:05.538
William!

21:08.752 --> 21:10.708
Will!

21:12.054 --> 21:14.277
Oh, God. Oh, God.

21:16.224 --> 21:18.114
Will!

21:26.433 --> 21:28.234
Will?

21:28.334 --> 21:30.557
Come here, buddy!

21:37.575 --> 21:39.231
Scott!

21:42.477 --> 21:45.400
Will. Will!

21:46.691 --> 21:49.803
Come on, baby? Will, are you okay?

21:49.948 --> 21:54.006
What the hell happened?
Why'd you take off like that? Why?

21:54.985 --> 21:58.609
Don't yell at him!
It was your idea to come out here!

22:37.157 --> 22:40.727
Oh, boy, real palace of fun down here.

22:40.827 --> 22:44.407
Saint Joseph's used to be
a convent a long time ago,

22:44.507 --> 22:46.301
this is part of the original building.

22:47.065 --> 22:50.668
You could be a bride of Christ too, Molly,
you've got the whole virgin thing going on.

22:50.768 --> 22:55.437
Actually, this is where they kept
the unmarried girls who got pregnant.

22:55.537 --> 22:59.306
It was a big deal back then if they weren't
married, you had to keep them out of sight.

23:00.206 --> 23:02.592
Didn't they shut this place down
before it became a school?

23:02.692 --> 23:06.210
Yeah, yeah, there were a lot of
weird stories going around

23:06.310 --> 23:09.592
like this 15 year old girl
claimed she was a virgin,

23:09.692 --> 23:13.082
said it was a miracle
like the Virgin Mary, but...

23:13.182 --> 23:14.638
no one believed her.

23:26.961 --> 23:28.929
So what happened to her?

23:29.029 --> 23:32.304
Don't you know, Ben? It was your mom.

23:32.404 --> 23:36.356
No, actually, she died
trying to abort her baby.

23:38.085 --> 23:39.908
Let's go.

24:15.669 --> 24:17.704
This is it.

24:17.804 --> 24:20.239
This is where Connor
and Jenna were killed.

24:20.339 --> 24:22.429
Are you getting this?

24:24.909 --> 24:26.999
You guys hear that?

24:27.427 --> 24:29.145
What?

24:29.245 --> 24:30.468
Stay focused.

24:58.771 --> 25:02.529
- This is where...
- We know. We saw the video.

25:07.167 --> 25:09.246
I wanna make sure
I don't forget anything.

25:09.346 --> 25:11.282
- Yeah? Let's see.
- Yeah.

25:11.382 --> 25:14.134
Stick to camera work, Dylan.
Words aren't really your thing.

25:14.234 --> 25:17.077
I just wanna make sure
there's no more horror in the hallways...

25:46.580 --> 25:49.504
You okay? What's wrong?

25:49.899 --> 25:51.688
Nothing.

26:01.256 --> 26:03.123
Five minutes.

26:03.223 --> 26:06.626
You guys couldn't act like a normal
goddamn family for five minutes.

26:06.726 --> 26:09.193
I think we're pretty normal
compared to those two.

26:09.293 --> 26:11.137
That creep deliberately baited Duncan.

26:11.495 --> 26:13.846
Sweetheart, it wasn't your fault.

26:13.946 --> 26:17.731
I don't know why your aunt got so mad
over some stupid piece of kitsch.

26:18.031 --> 26:21.332
She wasn't mad. She was scared.

26:21.432 --> 26:24.137
I can't believe you dragged us here
on Christmas Eve

26:24.237 --> 26:27.603
so that you could hustle your own aunt,
that is a new low, Taylor, even for you.

26:27.703 --> 26:28.787
It's not a hustle,

26:28.887 --> 26:32.954
the Bioplex is a means of integrating
technology into a sustainable future,

26:33.054 --> 26:37.410
where scientific innovation
is a shared experience.

26:37.510 --> 26:41.547
Fine, yeah, it's all good when it pays
for the house and the vacations

26:41.647 --> 26:46.739
and the school and the orthodontist,
but, otherwise, no, it's a big joke!

26:57.024 --> 26:58.846
Come on!

27:00.559 --> 27:03.116
Come on, come on.

27:06.297 --> 27:08.587
Damn, damn, damn!

27:10.667 --> 27:12.557
Seriously?

27:21.510 --> 27:25.047
I'm standing at the very spot
where Connor was found crucified

27:25.147 --> 27:28.682
exactly one year ago today
on Christmas Eve.

27:28.782 --> 27:32.653
Connor's neck was broken.
And over here...

27:33.453 --> 27:38.288
Jenna's mutilated body was found
hanging off some metal piping in the ceiling.

27:38.388 --> 27:40.822
Why would somebody go to so much effort?

27:40.922 --> 27:45.348
That is just one of the many unanswered
questions in this baffling case.

27:48.228 --> 27:49.662
How's it look?

27:49.762 --> 27:51.596
You guys...

27:51.696 --> 27:53.886
it's still here.

27:57.768 --> 28:00.570
Unto us a child is born.

28:00.670 --> 28:03.338
Unto us a son is given.

28:03.438 --> 28:05.238
That is fucking creepy.

28:05.338 --> 28:11.212
It's from Isaiah, Chapter 9,
Verse 6 about the birth of Jesus.

28:14.610 --> 28:17.278
Okay, this place is creeping me out.

28:17.378 --> 28:20.013
I think we've got everything
we need, let's go.

28:20.113 --> 28:22.586
Yeah, won't argue with you there.

28:40.031 --> 28:41.854
What the hell?

28:42.699 --> 28:44.133
What's wrong?

28:44.233 --> 28:46.736
What the fuck?
I could've sworn it was this one.

28:46.836 --> 28:49.291
Molly, come on, hurry up.

28:50.470 --> 28:52.260
Move.

28:53.039 --> 28:56.373
I tried them all three times,
none of them fit.

28:56.473 --> 28:58.163
Crap.

29:01.778 --> 29:03.512
Okay.

29:04.512 --> 29:06.336
Hello?

29:06.681 --> 29:08.771
Principal Harod!

29:10.284 --> 29:13.042
Principal Harod? Hello?

29:14.054 --> 29:16.088
Principal Harod!

29:16.188 --> 29:18.024
Fuck!

29:18.124 --> 29:20.813
Of course now, he isn't around.

29:24.427 --> 29:25.662
Can't see anything.

29:25.762 --> 29:28.625
I've got full bars and some service,
it should be ringing.

29:29.344 --> 29:30.735
Really?

29:31.331 --> 29:34.622
Guys, what if Principal Harod
locked us in?

29:35.034 --> 29:36.802
Why would he do that?

29:36.902 --> 29:39.742
For all we know,
he could be down here with us.

29:41.072 --> 29:43.362
I got nothing, too.

29:53.616 --> 29:55.417
Come on, baby.

29:55.517 --> 29:57.406
Smile.

29:59.019 --> 30:01.997
Will... you okay?

30:03.189 --> 30:06.658
Sport, don't just sit there. Look like
you've never seen a Christmas tree before.

30:06.758 --> 30:09.148
Why don't you help
your old man, all right?

30:20.303 --> 30:23.477
I like that one. Okay, I'll do it.

30:27.108 --> 30:29.398
Right there.

30:38.451 --> 30:41.575
I wasn't around much
last Christmas, I know.

30:42.988 --> 30:45.445
This year we're having fun, right?

31:00.170 --> 31:02.227
Slow down, Will.

31:25.161 --> 31:27.879
Looks like someone's
worked up an appetite.

31:28.746 --> 31:31.231
That's his second serving.

31:31.331 --> 31:35.289
It must be good.
It's making me hungry, let's eat.

31:38.503 --> 31:41.627
You're eating too fast,
you're gonna get a tummy ache.

31:44.807 --> 31:46.508
Hey.

31:46.708 --> 31:49.232
Will, you hear your mother
talking to you?

31:52.279 --> 31:54.370
All right, I think that's enough.

31:54.682 --> 31:57.040
- Damn it! What the fuck?
- Scott, no!

32:04.757 --> 32:06.625
I'll handle it.

32:06.725 --> 32:10.005
Yeah, you handle it.
What's wrong with that kid?

32:14.698 --> 32:16.754
Why'd you do that?

32:18.400 --> 32:19.627
Answer me!

32:23.937 --> 32:26.294
Go to your room right now!

32:41.020 --> 32:44.524
Christmas, the most
magical time of year,

32:44.624 --> 32:48.122
but in Bailey Downs this Christmas...

32:48.222 --> 32:50.310
it's different.

32:50.927 --> 32:54.629
It's gotta be. It's true,
my friends, and you know it is.

32:54.729 --> 32:57.699
So before I put another jingle
in your stocking,

32:57.799 --> 33:01.604
I want you to think about
the little ones in your life

33:01.704 --> 33:05.859
and give a thought to the little ones
who aren't with us anymore.

33:07.705 --> 33:11.641
Yeah, this next one's for them.
For Jenna.

33:12.841 --> 33:14.698
And Connor.

33:14.876 --> 33:20.436
From Saint Joseph's Academy
taken from us last year cruelly.

33:21.631 --> 33:24.049
I know they're listening.

33:24.149 --> 33:26.645
Somewhere out there.

33:56.540 --> 33:58.897
Martha, thank God!

34:00.109 --> 34:01.710
What's going on?

34:01.810 --> 34:05.835
It's the elves, I fear
they may all become infected.

34:06.547 --> 34:09.902
Infected? What do you mean?

34:10.648 --> 34:14.071
- Others are sick?
- It's worse than that.

34:15.751 --> 34:18.853
- What happened?
- Shiny's body is gone.

34:19.152 --> 34:24.007
He was laid to rest, but now...
it may already be too late.

34:24.107 --> 34:26.190
But this doesn't make any sense.

34:26.291 --> 34:31.617
Elves becoming the walking dead?
No, it does not make any sense.

34:31.717 --> 34:34.920
Unless he is behind it.

34:36.396 --> 34:38.356
Stand back, Martha!

34:44.472 --> 34:46.262
You need to hide!

34:46.674 --> 34:50.598
Open up, you fat fucking piece of shit!

34:51.275 --> 34:53.277
Here's Shiny!

34:53.377 --> 34:55.504
- Shiny risen from the dead!
- What?

34:55.603 --> 35:00.103
- Quick, go, hide!
- Where's my fucking cookie?

35:04.636 --> 35:06.825
Stay back, Jingles!

35:10.323 --> 35:13.914
Yeah. Yeah, I got you, you cocksucker!

35:14.025 --> 35:16.615
Motherfucker, oh, shit!

35:34.375 --> 35:38.143
- I didn't find any windows without bars.
- Same here.

35:38.243 --> 35:39.418
Guys, I can't be here,

35:39.518 --> 35:42.514
I'm supposed to be at the mall helping
with the food drive or mom's gonna kill me.

35:42.614 --> 35:45.216
We've all got places to be,
it's Christmas Eve, bro.

35:45.316 --> 35:47.839
There's gotta be
another way out of here.

35:58.661 --> 36:00.617
Oh, God.

36:17.244 --> 36:19.467
A little jumpy, Dylan?

36:23.460 --> 36:27.452
This is a nativity scene.
The school didn't put it up this year.

36:27.552 --> 36:30.353
You can't openly display
a nativity scene anymore.

36:30.453 --> 36:32.859
It's the war on Christmas.

36:34.621 --> 36:37.347
Damn it, more bars.

36:39.191 --> 36:41.247
Fuck, it's freezing down here.

36:42.693 --> 36:44.216
I can hear it.

36:47.396 --> 36:49.119
Damn thing is on.

36:58.405 --> 37:00.239
It won't...

37:00.839 --> 37:01.906
heat up.

37:02.006 --> 37:06.539
Look, if we just sit around and wait it out,
I'm sure that somebody is gonna notice.

37:06.639 --> 37:09.310
Only Caprice knows we're down here
and she's out of town.

37:09.410 --> 37:11.712
The school's not gonna reopen
for another week and a half.

37:11.812 --> 37:16.382
Look... if there was ever a time
to notice three missing kids,

37:16.482 --> 37:19.172
tonight would be it, right?

37:19.650 --> 37:21.907
We always open one gift.

37:26.188 --> 37:28.511
Every Christmas Eve.

37:29.457 --> 37:31.747
We eat pizza with champagne.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.823
Watch The Sound of Music.

37:36.194 --> 37:38.484
Before we go to bed...

37:40.730 --> 37:43.254
we each open one gift.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.622
Not this year.

37:48.970 --> 37:51.394
Hell of a Christmas?

37:56.476 --> 37:58.310
Hey.

37:58.410 --> 38:01.066
It's not pizza and champagne, but...

38:03.012 --> 38:05.779
- Merry Christmas.
- Thanks, Dylan.

38:05.879 --> 38:08.703
I didn't realize how starving I am.

38:09.114 --> 38:10.604
Yeah.

38:11.783 --> 38:13.473
What if he comes back?

38:14.418 --> 38:16.019
Who?

38:16.319 --> 38:19.355
The guy who killed Jenna and Connor,
what if he comes back tonight?

38:19.455 --> 38:21.723
I mean, we're trapped down here.

38:21.823 --> 38:25.884
- And there's a psychopath on the loose.
- Psycho's already here.

38:25.984 --> 38:29.463
Principal Harod. I'm sure he locked
the door on us, who else could it be?

38:29.563 --> 38:33.962
I get that he's creepy, okay?
But that doesn't mean he's a killer.

38:34.062 --> 38:37.154
Then what's he doing here?
On Christmas Eve?

38:39.434 --> 38:42.505
What makes matters worse, I gotta piss.

38:53.313 --> 38:56.170
I'm sure Joe won't mind...

38:56.582 --> 38:58.572
if I borrow this.

39:12.563 --> 39:14.892
What is this place?

39:40.055 --> 39:43.713
Caprice will know something's up
when Dylan doesn't call her tonight.

39:48.946 --> 39:51.453
What is that fucking smell?

40:06.444 --> 40:08.701
Do you hear that?

40:36.570 --> 40:38.427
What is it?

40:48.446 --> 40:50.235
What is it?

40:51.964 --> 40:53.621
I don't know.

41:16.936 --> 41:18.959
It stopped.

41:26.777 --> 41:29.246
Molly, Molly, come on!

41:29.346 --> 41:30.518
What's going on?

41:30.618 --> 41:33.149
I don't know. I don't know.
She started freaking and twitching!

41:33.249 --> 41:35.789
Molly!

42:19.457 --> 42:21.714
Will! Get out!

42:33.035 --> 42:34.725
Hey.

42:35.637 --> 42:37.360
Hey.

42:37.938 --> 42:41.456
- How's your hand?
- I'll live.

42:41.556 --> 42:44.342
Have you noticed Will
hasn't had to use his inhaler?

42:44.442 --> 42:46.765
Really? That's a good thing, right?

42:48.210 --> 42:49.889
Yeah.

42:50.245 --> 42:53.202
Something seems wrong.

42:53.547 --> 42:58.217
- Maybe we should take him to the doctor?
- The doctor? On Christmas Eve?

42:58.317 --> 43:00.306
Maybe we should just keep an eye on him.

43:00.886 --> 43:02.675
Come here.

43:05.656 --> 43:07.702
You know...

43:07.802 --> 43:10.462
they say you're allowed to open
one gift before Christmas.

43:16.832 --> 43:18.722
Scott...

43:22.570 --> 43:24.504
Not right now.

43:24.604 --> 43:27.461
All right, I just figured,
you know, it's...

43:27.572 --> 43:30.140
- it's been awhile.
- What's going on?

43:30.240 --> 43:32.309
What's going on with me?
What are you saying?

43:32.409 --> 43:34.844
I mean with Will.
The way he's been acting.

43:34.944 --> 43:37.878
Yeah, sure, whatever.
You know what, forget it.

43:37.978 --> 43:39.901
No, wait.

43:56.594 --> 43:57.998
<i>Yes!</i>

43:58.098 --> 44:00.330
<i>"Dangerous" Dan!</i>

44:00.430 --> 44:04.355
<i>Let's listen to this Christmas classic.</i>

46:11.314 --> 46:13.215
We should have stayed on the road.

46:13.315 --> 46:16.685
Didn't exactly wear my "trudging
through the woods" boots.

46:16.785 --> 46:19.587
Look, this will help us shave
a half hour off our walk back to Etta's,

46:19.687 --> 46:22.289
plus I gave you all the option
of staying in the car.

46:22.389 --> 46:26.324
Yeah, where mom and I would be easy prey
for drunk hillbilly rapists, no thanks, Dad.

46:26.424 --> 46:28.927
- We should make weapons.
- What?

46:29.027 --> 46:32.594
In case whatever dad nearly hit
comes and hunts us. The sun has set,

46:32.694 --> 46:36.431
it is officially Krampusnacht,
the night of Krampus.

46:36.531 --> 46:39.389
Son, that Krampus
is a load of old German bull...

46:41.392 --> 46:42.875
Dad!

46:43.171 --> 46:45.710
Oh, my God, what happened?

46:46.206 --> 46:48.096
Oh, my God, you're bleeding!

46:50.225 --> 46:52.832
- Am I shot?
- I don't know!

46:54.978 --> 46:58.669
Oh, my God. Duncan, get back here!

47:05.386 --> 47:07.142
Duncan!

47:15.193 --> 47:16.583
I got it!

47:20.797 --> 47:22.793
- Oh, my God! Duncan!
- Oh, my God, Duncan!

47:22.893 --> 47:24.940
Duncan!

47:25.662 --> 47:28.809
- Duncan!
- Duncan!

47:31.071 --> 47:33.506
Duncan, where are you?

47:33.606 --> 47:36.023
- Duncan!
- Answer me!

47:37.074 --> 47:38.864
Duncan?

47:42.845 --> 47:44.268
Duncan?

47:51.585 --> 47:53.108
Duncan?

48:06.163 --> 48:07.876
- Oh, my God!
- Where is he?

48:07.976 --> 48:10.267
I don't know. I don't know.

48:10.367 --> 48:13.491
- We need the police.
- Mom, there's no service out here.

48:15.803 --> 48:18.304
- What is that?
- Come on.

48:19.686 --> 48:21.175
Run!

48:22.073 --> 48:24.129
We have to run.

48:25.342 --> 48:27.032
Duncan?

48:53.600 --> 48:55.290
Sparkles!

48:55.802 --> 48:57.058
Sparkles!

49:31.300 --> 49:35.304
I'm gonna eat your fucking brains out,
you Christmas cunt.

49:35.404 --> 49:37.660
Fuck you!

49:38.205 --> 49:42.763
I'll break that fucking staff
in your rosy-cheeked ass, you fucker!

49:44.975 --> 49:47.465
I'm sorry, Shiny.

49:48.077 --> 49:50.346
I know it isn't your fault.

49:50.446 --> 49:53.370
You don't have
the Christmas balls, you...

49:58.819 --> 50:02.689
Bailey Downs, it's getting close there
and we're counting down to Christmas

50:02.789 --> 50:06.550
and "Dangerous" Dan
is pulling his annual double shift

50:06.650 --> 50:09.126
to stay with you until the end.

50:09.226 --> 50:10.949
What?

50:11.661 --> 50:14.863
What, we're... Okay,
well we're gonna check in

50:14.963 --> 50:18.531
with good ol' Stormin' Norman
down at the charity food drive.

50:18.631 --> 50:22.756
Hey, Norman! Normey, you're a little...

50:22.856 --> 50:24.417
little scratchy there, buddy.

50:24.517 --> 50:29.026
What, I did press the button, Susan.
Why don't you press your own button?

50:33.473 --> 50:37.177
Sorry, folks, looks like we got some of
those winter weather technical difficulties,

50:37.277 --> 50:40.316
too many reindeer in the atmosphere.

50:41.411 --> 50:46.737
That's my bet, so let's...
throw another eggnog on the fire.

50:47.115 --> 50:51.995
No, wait a minute, let's...
let's throw another log on the fire

50:52.095 --> 50:53.922
and pour yourself another eggnog.

50:54.322 --> 50:57.691
You know, get some good Christmas vibes.

50:57.791 --> 51:02.395
Out to Susan who is seriously
harshing my buzz right now.

51:02.495 --> 51:08.288
<i>And listen to this holly jolly classic.</i>

51:25.082 --> 51:26.904
Little shit.

51:27.249 --> 51:28.950
Will.

51:29.150 --> 51:30.873
Will!

51:31.251 --> 51:33.252
Will, where are you?

51:33.734 --> 51:36.176
- What is it?
- Where is he?

51:37.320 --> 51:39.254
Where is he? Will?

51:39.354 --> 51:42.377
- There you are.
- Baby, don't... don't!

51:42.555 --> 51:46.124
Did you open those presents? Did you?

51:46.324 --> 51:48.447
- Say something!
- Scott!

51:49.993 --> 51:53.094
- You think this is a game?
- What are you doing?

51:53.194 --> 51:56.651
Say something. Look at him,
think it's all one big fucking joke!

51:56.751 --> 51:58.225
- Scott!
- You think this is funny?

51:58.325 --> 51:59.333
- No!
- Move!

51:59.433 --> 52:03.573
No! No! No! Don't! Stop!

52:03.673 --> 52:05.170
I knew this would happen!

52:05.270 --> 52:07.772
You refused to see a doctor,
you said you could handle it!

52:07.872 --> 52:10.190
I... did you not see what he did?

52:10.290 --> 52:11.945
Get out!

52:36.595 --> 52:38.818
Will, you all right?

52:49.305 --> 52:53.341
- Hello?
- <i>Is this the Peters household?</i>

52:53.441 --> 52:55.109
Yes.

52:55.209 --> 52:58.578
<i>Got yourself a nice
Christmas tree, did you?</i>

52:58.678 --> 52:59.747
Who is this?

52:59.947 --> 53:03.082
You don't know me, just consider me
a concerned neighbor.

53:03.382 --> 53:06.418
<i>You were on my land,
took one of my trees,</i>

53:06.518 --> 53:09.041
<i>and I saw your license plate.</i>

53:10.354 --> 53:11.621
What do you want?

53:11.721 --> 53:15.446
Your boy, how is he? Did something
happen to him in the grove?

53:19.260 --> 53:21.636
- Look, I don't know...
- <i>I said...</i>

53:21.736 --> 53:25.052
<i>did something happen to your boy.</i>

53:25.530 --> 53:28.354
He got lost, but we found him later.

53:29.366 --> 53:32.533
No, you didn't. He's still lost.

53:32.833 --> 53:36.085
<i>Now we haven't got much time,
so you're gonna have to do as I say.</i>

53:36.385 --> 53:40.326
Bring the changeling back to the forest
where you lost your son.

53:41.838 --> 53:44.677
Changeling? What the hell is that?

53:45.007 --> 53:48.508
Ma'am... that ain't your son.

53:54.980 --> 53:57.871
- Don't call again.
- <i>Wait, wait!</i>

54:40.154 --> 54:41.977
Molly?

54:45.057 --> 54:48.326
We... were worried about you.

54:48.426 --> 54:52.095
- What is it? You okay?
- Just come.

54:52.195 --> 54:54.551
I have to show you something.

54:59.234 --> 55:01.357
Should I wake Ben?

55:05.472 --> 55:07.662
Where are you going?

55:09.959 --> 55:11.649
Molly?

55:12.411 --> 55:14.167
Okay.

55:35.467 --> 55:37.779
You kidding me?

55:43.406 --> 55:45.096
Molly.

55:50.245 --> 55:51.535
Wait.

55:53.047 --> 55:55.137
You're serious?

55:58.645 --> 56:00.475
Okay.

56:01.521 --> 56:04.378
Molly. Molly, Molly, Molly.

56:05.490 --> 56:09.381
Hey, this isn't gonna happen, Molly,
I have a girlfriend.

56:11.778 --> 56:14.509
I think you're in shock or something.

57:21.426 --> 57:23.082
Will?

57:28.432 --> 57:30.122
Will?

57:34.370 --> 57:36.427
Will, is that you?

57:58.326 --> 58:00.550
I shouldn't have lost my head
like that, I'm sorry.

58:06.433 --> 58:08.394
Dad's just...

58:08.494 --> 58:10.998
been a little stressed lately.

58:13.772 --> 58:17.562
But I'm trying. I'm trying to be better.

59:00.813 --> 59:02.236
Scott?

59:49.254 --> 59:51.043
Hurry!

59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.270
Hurry!

01:00:02.996 --> 01:00:05.303
Get in. In, in.

01:00:15.373 --> 01:00:18.890
Pull him here, get him here. Okay.

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:20.659
Okay.

01:00:28.584 --> 01:00:30.652
Do you think that you could walk?

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:32.754
We have to find Duncan.

01:00:32.854 --> 01:00:35.489
- Yeah, I can go, I can go.
- Dad, no, you can't.

01:00:35.889 --> 01:00:38.258
Mom, we have to stay here,
something's still out there.

01:00:38.358 --> 01:00:40.914
He is out there by himself.

01:00:41.759 --> 01:00:44.316
Mom, what if it really is Krampus?

01:00:44.928 --> 01:00:46.863
We have to stay in this church
until sunrise.

01:00:46.963 --> 01:00:49.266
- That is insane, let's go.
- Yeah, it is.

01:00:49.366 --> 01:00:53.389
Church, church,
we have to confess our sins.

01:00:54.068 --> 01:00:57.853
I'm not gonna make it to sunrise,
I've lost too much blood.

01:00:57.953 --> 01:01:01.389
We have to get past that thing.
They say it comes for the wicked.

01:01:01.489 --> 01:01:06.191
Maybe if we confess in a church,
we can absolve ourselves of our sins.

01:01:06.341 --> 01:01:08.442
That is ridiculous.

01:01:08.542 --> 01:01:10.675
I stole this.

01:01:10.777 --> 01:01:12.567
You what?

01:01:13.145 --> 01:01:15.168
From Aunt Etta's.

01:01:16.881 --> 01:01:19.616
I don't know why,
I can't really help myself.

01:01:19.716 --> 01:01:23.405
But honest, I'm not as bad as those
other kids with the sex and the drugs

01:01:23.505 --> 01:01:25.775
and the cutting and...

01:01:27.238 --> 01:01:29.528
Mom, I don't do that. I...

01:01:29.907 --> 01:01:33.781
I just steal stuff. Stupid stuff.

01:01:34.794 --> 01:01:36.229
I'm sorry.

01:01:36.329 --> 01:01:39.983
Even if this is that Krampus thing,
none of this is gonna help, okay?

01:01:40.083 --> 01:01:43.701
That monster took Duncan
and Duncan was innocent.

01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:46.091
No, he wasn't.

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:49.787
I mean, what do you think
happened to all our pets?

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:52.307
I'm going out there myself.

01:01:52.407 --> 01:01:56.599
Mom, the day our cat disappeared I found
Duncan in the garage with a garbage bag.

01:01:59.279 --> 01:02:01.536
He had blood all over his hands.

01:02:02.848 --> 01:02:06.572
- He was smiling.
- No! No!

01:02:07.968 --> 01:02:12.455
This is your fault! If you had just spent
more time with him, but all you care about

01:02:12.555 --> 01:02:15.925
- is your stupid precious business...
- There is no business.

01:02:16.125 --> 01:02:19.726
- What?
- Bioplex has been dead for years.

01:02:19.826 --> 01:02:22.950
I just raise money to pay debts
to keep things going.

01:02:24.462 --> 01:02:27.083
It's all gonna come crashing down.

01:02:27.731 --> 01:02:31.834
Etta was my last hope
and she thinks I'm a swindler.

01:02:31.934 --> 01:02:34.324
She's probably right.

01:02:35.436 --> 01:02:38.994
I'm so sorry.
We're gonna lose everything.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:42.079
And I'm going to jail.

01:02:43.875 --> 01:02:47.933
- Why would you...
- It was the only way I could keep you.

01:02:48.945 --> 01:02:51.002
I mean, come on.

01:02:51.414 --> 01:02:53.749
A guy like me with a woman like you?

01:02:54.149 --> 01:02:56.150
I wanted to give you nice things.

01:02:56.450 --> 01:03:02.235
A nice home, make you happy,
give you the life you deserve.

01:03:02.788 --> 01:03:06.045
I just thought that you weren't
interested anymore.

01:03:06.323 --> 01:03:08.346
Oh, no.

01:03:08.691 --> 01:03:11.181
I did it all for you.

01:03:19.267 --> 01:03:21.334
Merry Christmas.

01:03:21.434 --> 01:03:22.790
I'm sorry.

01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:29.027
Taylor!

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:32.762
- Taylor! Taylor!
- Dad!

01:03:37.811 --> 01:03:41.002
Go. Get in, get in!

01:04:21.047 --> 01:04:23.304
It's okay, it's okay.

01:04:27.519 --> 01:04:29.851
It's okay, it's okay.

01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:33.778
Mom...

01:04:36.191 --> 01:04:38.848
There's some...
there's something on my leg.

01:04:38.948 --> 01:04:43.185
- What?
- There's something on my leg.

01:05:05.966 --> 01:05:09.732
I love you. I love you. Run, go, run!

01:05:13.319 --> 01:05:15.843
Right here, you son of a bitch!

01:05:17.123 --> 01:05:19.145
Mom!

01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:56.791
What are you doing?

01:05:56.891 --> 01:05:58.759
Can you move the light?

01:05:58.859 --> 01:06:02.350
What happened? We...
We couldn't wake you up.

01:06:18.677 --> 01:06:21.034
Aren't you cold like that?

01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:26.037
Where's Dylan?

01:06:28.333 --> 01:06:29.734
In the room.

01:06:30.184 --> 01:06:31.874
That room?

01:06:33.953 --> 01:06:36.021
What's he doing there?

01:06:36.121 --> 01:06:38.945
He wanted me to join him, but...

01:06:39.957 --> 01:06:42.772
I wanted to stay here with you.

01:06:45.394 --> 01:06:46.917
Right.

01:07:11.652 --> 01:07:13.375
Molly...

01:07:14.087 --> 01:07:17.978
- Are you sure?
- This is what you want, isn't it?

01:08:32.993 --> 01:08:34.716
Ben...

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:41.346
What the fuck? What the fuck?
What the fuck did you do to me?

01:08:41.447 --> 01:08:43.901
What did I do to you?

01:08:44.001 --> 01:08:45.758
Fuck.

01:08:47.002 --> 01:08:48.926
Who's there?

01:08:51.872 --> 01:08:54.142
Dylan, is that you?

01:08:54.242 --> 01:08:55.898
Dylan?

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.703
Dylan?

01:09:06.251 --> 01:09:08.274
Ben, no.

01:09:12.372 --> 01:09:14.028
Don't.

01:09:21.362 --> 01:09:24.096
<i>I guess you're ready to listen now.</i>

01:09:24.197 --> 01:09:26.031
What do I do?

01:09:26.131 --> 01:09:27.618
<i>Listen good.</i>

01:09:27.718 --> 01:09:31.158
<i>You gotta bring the creature
back to the grove.</i>

01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:35.273
<i>But you gotta be careful,
it won't come willingly.</i>

01:09:35.372 --> 01:09:38.535
<i>It's tasted human pleasures.</i>

01:09:40.143 --> 01:09:41.211
What about Will?

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:44.279
<i>The only way is to bring
the changeling back,</i>

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:48.470
<i>but don't let it sense your intention,
it senses things.</i>

01:09:48.848 --> 01:09:51.550
<i>It cannot feel threatened.</i>

01:09:51.649 --> 01:09:53.751
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:55.685
Hello?

01:09:55.785 --> 01:09:57.541
Hello?

01:10:48.601 --> 01:10:50.357
Will.

01:10:52.037 --> 01:10:54.651
Do you wanna go for a ride?

01:11:10.252 --> 01:11:11.875
Hey, Will.

01:11:17.324 --> 01:11:19.814
You wanna put your boots on?

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.561
Come on, baby.

01:11:22.661 --> 01:11:26.619
You and mommy can go
have some fun outside.

01:11:27.564 --> 01:11:29.285
Yeah.

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:31.577
Come on, buddy.

01:14:01.065 --> 01:14:03.541
Come on, you little devils!

01:14:19.849 --> 01:14:22.436
Come on, you jolly fu...

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:34.549
I got ya! Come here, Santa,
you fat bastard!

01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:46.793
You again!

01:15:20.797 --> 01:15:23.138
It's complete and utter chaos
down at the mall,

01:15:23.238 --> 01:15:26.736
police and emergency cruiser
on the scene. We don't really know...

01:15:26.836 --> 01:15:30.740
what's going on, still no word
from Stormin' Norman.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:35.042
But I'm sure a crusty ol' bird
like Norman will be fine.

01:15:35.142 --> 01:15:40.012
We give Norman a hard time around here,
but he's the weatherman, so...

01:15:40.112 --> 01:15:44.081
I think he has a Master's Degree from
Colombia or something depressing like that.

01:15:44.181 --> 01:15:47.249
But we love him...

01:15:47.349 --> 01:15:49.651
so check in as soon as you can, Normey.

01:15:49.751 --> 01:15:53.154
In the meantime, it's my job
to keep the Christmas spirit alive

01:15:53.254 --> 01:15:56.521
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Let's give this...

01:15:56.621 --> 01:16:00.648
next yuletide tune a spin.

01:16:02.194 --> 01:16:04.517
Oh, man.

01:16:24.544 --> 01:16:26.367
Hello?

01:16:36.438 --> 01:16:38.182
Don't point that thing at me, honey.

01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:41.513
Put it down, it's okay.

01:16:42.558 --> 01:16:44.955
- I brought it.
- Thanks.

01:16:45.055 --> 01:16:47.482
What's the matter with you?

01:16:48.627 --> 01:16:50.395
There's so many of them.

01:16:50.495 --> 01:16:54.197
It's all right, they're not gonna touch you
as long as I'm here. They're afraid of me.

01:16:54.297 --> 01:16:56.633
I know how to herd them, herd them good.

01:16:56.733 --> 01:16:59.667
The trolls have been
on our land for generations.

01:16:59.767 --> 01:17:02.102
I guess you could say I watch over them.

01:17:02.202 --> 01:17:05.872
Thanks for bringing this one back, it would've
sensed me coming from a mile away.

01:17:05.972 --> 01:17:08.610
I brought it like you said.

01:17:08.710 --> 01:17:10.962
Now where's my son?

01:17:11.674 --> 01:17:13.842
I don't know.

01:17:13.942 --> 01:17:15.176
What'd you do?

01:17:15.276 --> 01:17:18.706
You keep running off and now look what
you've done. Now look what you've done!

01:17:18.806 --> 01:17:21.285
- What are you doing, where's my son?
- The little devils never listen.

01:17:21.385 --> 01:17:24.153
They never listen no matter
how many times I tell them.

01:17:33.255 --> 01:17:34.911
What?

01:17:37.425 --> 01:17:39.959
Where is he? I want my son back!

01:17:40.059 --> 01:17:42.695
I wish I could help, but I can't,
it's not up to me.

01:17:42.795 --> 01:17:45.852
You lied to me! It killed my husband!

01:17:46.731 --> 01:17:49.055
Don't hurt it! Put the gun...

01:17:51.802 --> 01:17:53.558
No!

01:18:08.081 --> 01:18:10.338
My baby boy, please.

01:18:16.755 --> 01:18:18.411
My son.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.717
Oh, Will...

01:18:47.748 --> 01:18:49.538
Mommy?

01:18:51.117 --> 01:18:52.940
Come here!

01:18:53.385 --> 01:18:55.075
Is that really you?

01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:59.211
Oh, look at you, oh, God, oh, baby.

01:18:59.407 --> 01:19:00.990
Oh, baby.

01:19:01.090 --> 01:19:03.913
- I got lost.
- Oh, it's okay, baby.

01:19:04.825 --> 01:19:08.761
It's okay, it's okay, baby.
It's okay, sweetheart.

01:19:08.861 --> 01:19:11.083
It's okay, baby.

01:19:12.462 --> 01:19:14.485
Let's go home.

01:19:28.108 --> 01:19:29.764
Dylan?

01:19:55.163 --> 01:19:56.953
Molly!

01:19:57.999 --> 01:19:59.026
Oh, God.

01:19:59.126 --> 01:20:01.508
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:20:02.301 --> 01:20:04.057
Dylan.

01:20:08.039 --> 01:20:09.495
No.

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:14.966
Dylan.

01:20:41.335 --> 01:20:43.325
Oh, God.

01:20:50.042 --> 01:20:52.949
Grace wants me to carry her son.

01:20:55.513 --> 01:20:57.014
Who?

01:20:57.214 --> 01:21:02.359
That 15 year old girl who tried
to get rid of her baby, this is her room.

01:21:04.453 --> 01:21:07.117
Molly, where are you getting this from?

01:21:08.656 --> 01:21:13.013
Connor and Jenna wouldn't help her,
but you and I did.

01:21:15.394 --> 01:21:17.751
I'm going to have her child.

01:21:18.729 --> 01:21:21.219
You brought us down here!

01:21:22.398 --> 01:21:24.888
You fucked me.

01:21:26.501 --> 01:21:29.024
And you killed Dylan!

01:21:54.105 --> 01:21:56.066
Molly! Molly!

01:21:57.758 --> 01:22:00.149
Help me, Molly!

01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:45.343
Aunt Etta!

01:23:50.593 --> 01:23:52.127
Etta!

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:54.581
Etta, let me in!

01:23:58.999 --> 01:24:01.222
Aunt Etta!

01:24:10.042 --> 01:24:11.932
Etta!

01:24:13.128 --> 01:24:15.721
Don't leave me out here!

01:24:24.422 --> 01:24:26.345
Etta!

01:24:27.324 --> 01:24:29.630
Etta, help me!

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:11.051
Merry Christmas, motherfucker!

01:25:37.185 --> 01:25:39.587
It is almost dawn.

01:25:39.687 --> 01:25:41.577
We will be safe.

01:25:42.188 --> 01:25:45.423
Shouldn't we try and fix this
to trap him again?

01:25:45.523 --> 01:25:47.157
Whatever do you mean?

01:25:47.257 --> 01:25:51.717
Wasn't that how he got out?
When Duncan broke it?

01:25:51.817 --> 01:25:56.030
Oh, no, dear, this is just an ornament.

01:25:56.130 --> 01:25:58.498
Then how did Gerhart turn into it?

01:25:58.798 --> 01:26:01.733
Krampus is a Christmas spirit.

01:26:01.833 --> 01:26:04.490
And like your father said...

01:26:04.902 --> 01:26:08.193
The Christmas spirit can fill anyone.

01:26:09.238 --> 01:26:14.319
But if your heart is blackened
with anger and vindictiveness,

01:26:14.519 --> 01:26:19.413
then this spirit will fill it
until you become a hellish beast.

01:26:19.613 --> 01:26:22.404
A hunter of the wicked.

01:26:22.716 --> 01:26:25.712
Gerhart's anger let it in and...

01:26:25.812 --> 01:26:27.273
He came after us.

01:26:30.388 --> 01:26:34.292
So you kicked Gerhart out
after you kicked us out.

01:26:35.342 --> 01:26:38.950
Then you put the cross on the door
to protect yourself from Krampus, right?

01:26:39.995 --> 01:26:41.963
Yes.

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:44.897
- That's why you sent us away.
- What?

01:26:44.997 --> 01:26:48.900
You knew my fucked up family would be shark
bait for that thing, so you got rid of us.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.401
- Wait, it isn't like that at all...
- Sure it is!

01:26:51.701 --> 01:26:55.853
You thought Gerhart was gonna turn so you
sent us away knowing that he'd come after us.

01:26:55.953 --> 01:26:59.340
You sacrificed us for Krampus
to save your selfish old ass!

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:02.109
Oh, please, please, now calm yourself.

01:27:02.209 --> 01:27:06.011
You don't know the forces
that you are playing with.

01:27:06.111 --> 01:27:08.133
Yes, I do.

01:27:10.963 --> 01:27:13.086
And I know something else.

01:27:15.182 --> 01:27:16.750
You've been a bad girl.

01:27:19.602 --> 01:27:21.859
Mother of God!

01:27:32.961 --> 01:27:35.964
Police are telling...
people just to stay away.

01:27:36.064 --> 01:27:39.825
All right, just keep clear of the mall.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:45.802
I know a lot of you are worried
about your friends and family, well...

01:27:45.902 --> 01:27:48.392
the best thing you can do is just...

01:27:48.492 --> 01:27:50.476
stay put.

01:27:50.807 --> 01:27:53.374
And pray for a Christmas miracle.

01:27:56.878 --> 01:28:01.565
Still no word on how many hostages
there may be down there, but...

01:28:01.815 --> 01:28:05.606
But just... just stay at home.

01:28:06.485 --> 01:28:08.775
For the love of God.

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:55.851
Is that you, dear?

01:29:25.625 --> 01:29:27.715
Who's there?

01:29:31.395 --> 01:29:34.520
Martha... is that you?

01:29:40.537 --> 01:29:42.827
Leave me alone.

01:29:43.406 --> 01:29:45.641
It's safe now.

01:29:45.741 --> 01:29:47.297
It's over.

01:29:48.076 --> 01:29:50.165
It's not over!

01:30:03.489 --> 01:30:05.718
Oh, my darling.

01:30:52.164 --> 01:30:54.387
Who's there?

01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:22.621
I knew it. Krampus!

01:31:22.721 --> 01:31:24.678
Vile enemy of Christmas.

01:31:37.199 --> 01:31:39.422
We end this tonight.

01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:20.958
Norman, stop!

01:32:23.672 --> 01:32:26.007
Please don't kill me, Norman.

01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:27.874
Norman?

01:32:27.974 --> 01:32:29.942
Who's Norman?

01:32:30.042 --> 01:32:32.332
What the fuck is wrong with you, Norman?

01:33:08.778 --> 01:33:11.668
<i>Martha, is that you?</i>

01:33:13.214 --> 01:33:16.205
- <i>Leave me alone.</i>
- <i>It's only me.</i>

01:33:29.728 --> 01:33:32.596
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:33:32.696 --> 01:33:34.452
Fuck!

01:34:03.623 --> 01:34:04.890
It's time.

01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:08.281
Freeze! Put your hands up now!

01:34:44.926 --> 01:34:47.996
<i>What the hell is it about Christmas
in Bailey Downs?</i>

01:34:48.096 --> 01:34:50.163
<i>Are we cursed or something?</i>

01:34:50.263 --> 01:34:54.717
<i>Why does this season of love
and peace and goodwill</i>

01:34:54.817 --> 01:34:58.403
<i>keep ending in blood
and death and horror?</i>

01:34:58.503 --> 01:35:01.039
<i>You keep the spirit in your hearts,
you hear me, people.</i>

01:35:01.139 --> 01:35:03.088
<i>You hug your loved ones
and you keep them close</i>

01:35:03.188 --> 01:35:06.531
<i>and you treat them every Christmas
like it might be your last.</i>

01:35:14.150 --> 01:35:18.050
<i>Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

01:35:18.150 --> 01:35:22.130
<i>Over the fields we go
Laughing all the way</i>

01:35:22.230 --> 01:35:25.870
<i>Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright</i>

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:30.130
<i>What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight</i>

01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:34.210
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way</i>

01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:38.170
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:40.817
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle...</i>

01:35:40.935 --> 01:35:42.136
<i>Let's go to the phones.</i>

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:45.237
<i>Hey, look, if they just had more
police training, then stuff like this...</i>

01:35:45.337 --> 01:35:50.474
You think more police can do anything?
Are you... it's Christmas!

01:35:50.574 --> 01:35:54.945
There are magical dark forces
out there. People, wake up!

01:35:55.045 --> 01:36:01.083
It's a beautiful season, it's light
and it's dark and it's ying and it's yang.

01:36:01.183 --> 01:36:03.951
For our Asian friends out there,
