RENY: Me, too, man. I think I'm still drunk.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.060
I think I might shit my pants, too.

Oh, make sure you do that
during the presentation.

Mmm-hmm.

- Can I have a moment?
- Sorry, princess.

- You're late. Let's go.
- I know.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.700
- I redid the layout.
- Why? The layout was perfect.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.500

a lot lately.

you're only allowed to tell me

how to do my job if you show up on time.

Is my hand shaking?

- I can't find anything.
- It's in your hand.

I don't know why I do this to myself.

If you have to widen your stance
a little bit, that's fine,

but make sure
your back foot is in total contact.

There you go.

- Are we going back to charcoal number two?

Oh. Well, I don't really notice
a difference.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.260
I know. Me, too.

Well, we were saying,
"Why not get both," right?

04:22.280 --> 04:23.540
So we have the option?

04:23.640 --> 04:27.100
No, but what he's saying is
that there's no difference between the two.

GABE: When I started this company,
I had a vision that we could enhance real life

05:26.800 --> 05:29.770
with a magical layer in front of it.

05:30.400 --> 05:35.180
In order to pull off that technology,
it has to be fully immersive.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.740
And to be immersive,
it has to be seamless.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.620

05:39.720 --> 05:42.140
and what we've worked so hard
to innovate past

05:42.240 --> 05:44.980
is that it doesn't actually seem real.

05:45.080 --> 05:48.740
In my opinion, Augmenta is the first,

05:48.840 --> 05:52.401
actually convincing,
augmented reality system.

05:58.280 --> 06:01.460
Your competition, at this point,
is basically a household name.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.688
More than household, it's ubiquitous.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.780
Yeah. And that name signifies
something that's new, that works,

06:06.880 --> 06:08.564
that people better know about.

06:08.680 --> 06:11.180

But I don't know how we market that.

what your competitor does.

06:25.560 --> 06:26.766
They sell distraction.

It's lightsabers,
it's AR drinking games...

06:30.560 --> 06:33.643
It's, uh, picking up chicks
with a face scanner.

06:33.760 --> 06:38.020

Yeah, it's nerdy. And maybe they know that
and maybe they don't.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.580
But either way, they don't care
and they're not concerned

06:46.680 --> 06:48.780
because they know that they have
built-in market recognition

06:48.880 --> 06:50.740
and they know that they're reliable
on the OS end.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.340
- They're not.
- DAVID: But the sad reality is,

06:52.440 --> 06:54.180
you've got a boner
for the newest face-computer.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.408
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna buy it from the establishment.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.410

How do we address it?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.060

what the technology can do for you,

07:09.920 --> 07:13.580
We feel really strongly about this.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.180
It's Bedford Avenue.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.580
David. What does that mean in reality?

07:26.680 --> 07:30.780
In reality it means
they're all out there masturbating.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.087
We're here actually fucking.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.561
Yeah.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.609
Augmenta is not a toy.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.364
It's an extremely powerful, creative tool.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.011
So, this is our approach.

07:48.400 --> 07:53.042
We give a pair to a genius-level creative.

07:55.120 --> 07:58.567
We let them play around with it,
we see what comes back.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.620

selling your magic glasses, though.

13:57.760 --> 14:00.620
I don't know. I guess I just never
thought of myself as the kind of girlfriend

14:00.720 --> 14:03.060
who was always like hanging around.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.161
Right.

I mean, you like living with Juliette.
I didn't mean...

14:06.840 --> 14:09.220
You know, it's weird. You would think
when you live with somebody

14:09.320 --> 14:11.220
you would get to know them really well.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.420

more acutely aware

14:13.520 --> 14:16.140

about that job at your agency?

14:47.480 --> 14:51.540
Yeah. Or I could get you a job, uh,
working for the mob.

That works, too. I mean,
I don't know how much, uh, experience...

you can send the arm up.

your back will make a little more space

How? Govindas is in the hot tub naked
with two students.

Hey, you're kind of breaking up.

I just want to come home.

I can't really hear you, sweetheart.

maybe I could call you back in a little bit?

to the three cameras we already have.

that we could have one always rolling,

- Make it more natural.

that it's back in the chair.

How are we supposed to know
that he's a pilot?

and he's in a cockpit.

- Is the other camera here?
- It's coming, it's on its way.

- but I'm not seeing a pilot.

I'm thinking maybe Govindas
takes this slot from this point forward.

I think that's the right move.

building this class for like a year, Gary.

- It's like when an instructor comes on time...
- Mmm-hmm.

38:17.880 --> 38:20.180
...and draws a lot of students here,

38:20.280 --> 38:24.100
then we help more people
and make more money. You get that, right?

that this is something so easy to use,

even though they know, consciously,

with Augmenta organically.

is contrived, right?

Yeah. We want the real deal
and we want the real Reggie.

I was so excited when I heard from Alicia,

40:36.960 --> 40:40.740
that this was even considered
to be a possibility.

40:40.840 --> 40:44.260
I was so jazzed about it
because it's hard to find a situation

42:05.760 --> 42:08.445
Goodbye. It's been nice knowing you.

42:10.440 --> 42:13.940
Do you see
how the mind is receiving consciousness,

42:14.040 --> 42:16.042
rather than creating it?

42:18.360 --> 42:22.660
It's as if the brain
is an operating system.

42:22.760 --> 42:28.324
And built in to that operating system
are a series of glitches.

42:28.440 --> 42:29.487
Yeah.

as a closed system,

42:33.040 --> 42:38.001
and you divide a line and then shift it,

you're gonna do anything about it,

what companies I want to work for, okay?

and I try to do a good job.

this whole visual synthesizer thing

58:45.040 --> 58:49.648
with the augmented technology and it's cool,
but it's a little bit...

58:50.280 --> 58:55.100
Hmm, I don't know, a little bit too much
in the entertainment arena.

58:55.200 --> 58:57.940
So, and that's cool, obviously

58:58.040 --> 59:03.180

in deeper implications with the technology.

59:03.280 --> 59:04.260
Yeah.

59:04.360 --> 59:08.180
Really to change
your psychological outlook...

- Yeah, totally.
- On what it means to be who you are.

59:12.040 --> 59:13.980
Yeah. Sounds good.

I think that that's heavier.
That's a heavier concept.

59:18.440 --> 59:20.700

there was this homeless lady,

59:20.800 --> 59:23.780
that I did a 3-D rendering
of under a bridge.

59:23.880 --> 59:27.420
And I was like, "Wow, how could I
incorporate that into my reality?"

- Uh-huh.

59:35.400 --> 59:38.500
You know?

59:38.600 --> 59:41.980

try to avoid all of your life.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.140

59:45.240 --> 59:48.220
But now we give people
the option to confront it now

- Hi, Erin.

Um, is there any space left
in Shana's class?

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.489
Oh, actually Shana's out today.
Govindas is subbing.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.660
Great.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.540
If you can,
keep extending the arms and go down.

Left shoulder towards the left knee.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.300
Great. Now lift and open the chest.

Drive the arms long
and then take the left hand down.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.620
Great. Breathe. Get strong there.
If the arms are helping you,

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.220
let them help you more.
Straighten the arms. Drive the spine long.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.300
Make more space.
See if you can get the legs underneath you,

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.740
and then go up.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:32.285
From the left hand, go up.

Everyone come out of it.

bring your feet together.

come take a look.

So, it's going well, but there's
a little bit... She's working, yeah?

She's working, working, working,
trying to come to it.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.244
Let's see if we can bring it to her.
Yeah. The Earth there.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.180
Bring your foot to mine. Great.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.940
Now she has somewhere to go. Yeah?
Somewhere to come from.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.580
And the chest can open, the spine.
Now less effort, right?

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.284
She's breathing a little more.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:12.340
Face is relaxed. Great. And now she can
even come up to balance from here, yeah?

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.169
Probably, yeah? Ardha Chandrasana.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.540
Beautiful. The spine is in,
the legs are underneath her.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:25.780
Yeah? Beautiful. Now she can probably
even grab the foot maybe, right?

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.220
And now the leg can,
the other leg can help her, right?

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.370
Both legs are now driving the heart open.

Consciousness, and not matter,

(GROWLS)

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.340
Is the atomic symbolization

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:49.700
of those people who wish to understand
as though it is just a binary reality

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.260
in all that we are
and all that we will ever be.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.100

of single-cellular structures

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.340
that form in the molecular bonds
that we have to understand,

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.500
but is the quantum phasic entanglement.

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:07.020
And it is who we desire to be through pain
and justice and understanding.

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.780

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.460
you can always remember
that you're a conscious individual.

the footage he provided.

I'm gonna be a really good chef.

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.820
Okay. I don't believe you, but...

01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:00.685
- I'm really hungry. Should I call Wendy?
- Yes.

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:04.044
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.860
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:09.531
We should find a place
without cell phone service.

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:11.460
Ugh.

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:15.780
- What the fuck do you want?
- David, hey, hang on.

01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.620
- Satan.
- This thing on the glasses...

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.580
- Yes.
- The thing you made of Sophie,

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:22.700
it's incredible, you little genius!

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:24.460
I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about, man.

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.848
That avatar thing.
It's amazing, they're freaking out!

01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:28.961
Holy shit.

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:30.525
David, listen to me,

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:34.731
they are freaking out, okay?

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.420
They stopped the rollout.

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:41.140
They want to make the Sophie avatar
the spokesperson for Augmenta.

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:44.780
They'll de-emphasize the sex stuff.
Uh, Gabe says it's implied.

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:47.780
Well, you already fired me, Scott,
so I don't know what the fuck you want.

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:50.486
No, they want to redo everything!

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:54.660
(CHUCKLES) We have to go to Malaysia.
They're on the phone with them right now

01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:57.940
They said,
"Bring us the man who made this!"

01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:00.500
Well, what did you tell them?

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:02.602
I said, "I'll call him right now!"

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:09.420
David, we are gold. This is huge.

01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:13.260
I know Malaysia sounds far and it is far
as hell, but we'll do first class.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.900
It's, it's awesome.
We'll get wasted, we'll pass out...

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.650
(SCOTT CONTINUES TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.171
(SIGHS)
