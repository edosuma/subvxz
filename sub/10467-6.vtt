WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:05.092
SARAH. SARAH,
YOU HAVE TO COME.

00:05.092 --> 00:07.485
YOU KNOW THE PART
WHERE EVERYONE SITS AROUND

00:07.485 --> 00:10.793
AND NAMES ALL THE THINGS
THAT THEY'RE GRATEFUL
FOR IN THE LAST YEAR?

00:10.793 --> 00:13.752
WELL, WHO'S GONNA DO THAT?
YOU'RE LIKE THE CHAMP
AT THAT.

00:13.752 --> 00:15.363
I DON'T KNOW, BAILEY.

00:15.363 --> 00:18.148
I DON'T THINK I'M
GONNA BE UP FOR IT.

00:18.148 --> 00:21.195
MAYBE--MAYBE THE LIST
IS GETTING SHORTER.

00:21.195 --> 00:23.197
COME ON, DON'T SAY THAT.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.199
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.592
THERE'S CHARLIE'S NEW BABY.

00:27.592 --> 00:30.073
THERE'S YOUR DOING GREAT
IN SCHOOL.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.466
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.468
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT.
YOU MEANT US.

00:33.468 --> 00:37.124
AND...LOOK, WE'LL GET
THROUGH THIS.

00:37.124 --> 00:40.779
THIS IS JUST US
FIGURING STUFF OUT.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.085
RIGHT?

00:42.085 --> 00:44.479
WHY DON'T YOU COME TODAY?

00:44.479 --> 00:47.525
IT'LL BE SO WEIRD
WITH YOU NOT HERE.

00:47.525 --> 00:50.528
I MEAN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN
THAT YOU'RE NOT HERE?

00:50.528 --> 00:52.835
WELL, IT'S GONNA BE
WEIRD FOR ME, TOO,
BAILEY, BUT I CAN'T.

00:52.835 --> 00:55.011
WELL, SO THEN--

00:55.011 --> 00:57.057
YOU KNOW WHAT, BAY?
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.103
I MEAN, I'VE HARDLY SLEPT
AT ALL, OK?

01:00.103 --> 01:02.018
BYE.

01:11.941 --> 01:14.117
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

01:14.117 --> 01:16.424
BLAM...BLAM!

01:16.424 --> 01:18.121
BLAM!

01:18.121 --> 01:21.211
BLAM...BLAM...BLAM.

01:21.211 --> 01:24.171

01:25.824 --> 01:27.913
BLAM! BLAM!

01:27.913 --> 01:29.915
LET'S GO,
MR. TERMINATOR MAN.

01:29.915 --> 01:32.875
I'M NOT TERMINATOR.
I'M THUNDER TROOPER!

01:32.875 --> 01:34.703
OK,
THUNDER TROOPER OWEN,

01:34.703 --> 01:36.835

WE'VE GOTTA GET SOME
EXTRA SMALL PAMPERS

01:39.360 --> 01:40.970

01:40.970 --> 01:42.798
CAN I GET IT, CHARLIE?

01:42.798 --> 01:45.061
20 BUCKS FOR
A PIECE OF PLASTIC?

01:45.061 --> 01:47.672
I'LL MAKE YOU ONE
OUT OF WOOD WAY
BETTER THAN THIS.

01:47.672 --> 01:48.978
LET'S GO.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.980
CAN I GO ON
THE MERRY-GO-ROUND?

01:50.980 --> 01:53.591
WE GOT LOADS OF MORE
STORES TO GO TO.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.811
PLEASE, CHARLIE, PLEASE?

01:55.811 --> 01:59.162
OK, ONE RIDE
WHILE I CALL HOME,
ALL RIGHT?

01:59.162 --> 02:02.034
AND ONE MEANS ONE.

02:02.034 --> 02:05.255
NO, I DIDN'T GET HER
THE PACIFIER. I COULDN'T
FIND THE KIND SHE LIKES.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.736
UH...THE DUCK HEAD.

02:07.736 --> 02:10.042
SURE I CAN TELL WHAT KIND
SHE LIKES, THE KIND
SHE DOESN'T SPIT OUT.

02:10.042 --> 02:14.090
AND WHAT'S THIS FORMULA TYPE?
I CAN'T EVEN READ YOUR WRITING.

02:14.090 --> 02:17.528
OH, SURE. YOU
TRY WRITING WHILE
YOU'RE NURSING

02:17.528 --> 02:20.183
AND MAKING COFFEE
AT THE SAME TIME.

02:20.183 --> 02:23.186
AND WHEN ARE PEOPLE
GETTING HERE, ANYWAY?

02:23.186 --> 02:26.494
BECAUSE I CANNOT--CANNOT
DO ANYTHING ABOUT FIXING
A BIG TURKEY DINNER.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.060
IT'S ALL SET UP.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.062
JULIA'S COMING EARLY,
KIRSTEN, TOO.

02:30.062 --> 02:32.413
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS TURN

02:32.413 --> 02:34.197
CHARLIE, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO ALL THIS.

02:34.197 --> 02:36.156
IT'S EASY. IT'S STUFFED
AND EVERYTHING.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.159
OVEN ON, INSERT BIRD.

04:43.848 --> 04:45.763

04:45.763 --> 04:48.070
I'M SORRY. I'M LOOKING

04:48.070 --> 04:51.160
COME WITH ME, HONEY.
STAY AWAY FROM PEOPLE

04:51.160 --> 04:53.467

HE GRABBED ME.

04:53.467 --> 04:54.337
OWEN!

05:02.693 --> 05:06.306

AT YOUR HOUSE.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.440
YEAH. YEAH, I DO.
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE IT
AT THE HOUSE.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.400
MY FOLKS TAKE US TO THE CLUB
SO THEY CAN TELL, LIKE,

05:13.400 --> 05:16.403
A MILLION GOLF STORIES
A MINUTE WITH THEIR FRIENDS.

05:16.403 --> 05:19.057
SO...DUH? WE'LL
GO TO MY HOUSE.
IT'LL BE GREAT.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.798
YOU ALREADY KNOW
EVERYBODY.

05:20.798 --> 05:25.368
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I
SHOULD BE WITH MY FAMILY.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.414
IT'S TURKEY DAY AND ALL.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.373
BESIDES, IT'S, LIKE,
HOLIDAY MEAL
WITH THE FAMILY.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.375
THAT'S A BIG--BIG DEAL.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.638
IT'S LIKE A BIG STEP.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.379
SO WHAT ARE YOU
TELLING ME?

05:36.379 --> 05:38.338
IT'S LIKE A BIG
COMMITMENT OR SOMETHING?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.209
LIKE MY BROTHERS ARE
GONNA ASK YOU WHAT
YOUR INTENTIONS ARE?

05:40.209 --> 05:42.211
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHETHER GRIFFIN'S
GONNA BE THERE,

05:42.211 --> 05:44.387
YOU SHOULD JUST ASK ME,
HMM?

05:44.387 --> 05:45.736
WELL, IS HE?

05:47.347 --> 05:48.696
NO.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.872
NO GRIFFIN.

05:50.872 --> 05:53.265
HE FEELS AS WEIRD
ABOUT BEING THERE
AS YOU DO.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.615
WEIRDER EVEN.

05:54.615 --> 05:56.747
NOW DO YOU WANT
TO COME?

06:00.664 --> 06:01.883
OWEN!

06:10.848 --> 06:12.067
MISS?

06:12.067 --> 06:13.721
MISS, EXCUSE ME.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.113
YOU REMEMBER I

06:15.113 --> 06:17.115
KIND OF.YEAH. GOOD.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.682
UH, I HAD MY LITTLE

06:20.467 --> 06:22.686

06:22.686 --> 06:24.166

06:24.166 --> 06:26.734
YOU DO REMEMBER.
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM SINCE?

06:27.865 --> 06:29.780
I DON'T THINK SO.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.782
YOU DON'T THINK OR HE
HASN'T BEEN BACK HERE?

06:31.782 --> 06:33.480
I...

06:33.480 --> 06:34.481
TELL ME, DAMN IT!

06:34.481 --> 06:35.873
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM. NO.

PA: ATTENTION SHOPPERS,

06:40.182 --> 06:42.663

06:42.663 --> 06:45.187
FOR THE HOLIDAY.
THANK YOU.

06:45.187 --> 06:48.103
ATTENTION SHOPPERS--

06:48.103 --> 06:49.496
WHERE DO I DRAW
THE LINE, KIRSTEN?

06:49.496 --> 06:51.802
I MEAN,
YOUR BEING FAIR TO ME.

06:51.802 --> 06:54.805
AT WHAT PRECISE POINT
DO I DRAW THE LINE AND SAY,
"OK, THAT'S ENOUGH."

06:54.805 --> 06:56.633
YOU SPEND ENOUGH TIME
OVER THERE.

06:56.633 --> 06:59.027
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME
HELPING OUT WITH THE BABY?

06:59.027 --> 07:01.203
BECAUSE THAT WAS--
THEY NEEDED ME.

07:01.203 --> 07:03.640
WHEN DON'T
THESE PEOPLE NEED YOU?

07:05.599 --> 07:08.253
THIS IS ABOUT
THANKSGIVING, OK?

07:08.253 --> 07:11.779
SOME OTHER TIME WE'LL
TALK ABOUT DOES CHARLIE
LEAN ON ME TOO MUCH.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.607
NO. WE ARE DEFINITELY
GOING TO TALK ABOUT

07:13.607 --> 07:15.391
WHETHER OR NOT CHARLIE
LEANS ON YOU TOO MUCH.

07:15.391 --> 07:19.221
BUT NOT TODAY, OK?
BECAUSE TODAY
IS THANKSGIVING.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.005
YOU KNOW...
PILGRIMS...

07:21.005 --> 07:22.485
TURKEYS...

07:22.485 --> 07:24.444
YEAH, I'M FAMILIAR
WITH THE CONCEPT.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.923
GOOD.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.316
SO WE'VE GOT
A CHOICE.

07:27.316 --> 07:28.926
WE CAN BAIL ON
THE SALINGERS.

07:28.926 --> 07:30.319
I CAN CALL THEM
RIGHT NOW.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.539
AND WE CAN GO TO
DR. PATEL'S INSTEAD.

07:32.539 --> 07:36.151
DR. PATEL,
WHO ALL HE DOES
IS TALK TO YOU

07:36.151 --> 07:37.892
ABOUT SOME ARTICLE
HE'S WRITING
FOR THE--

07:37.892 --> 07:39.807
JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY.

07:39.807 --> 07:43.158
UH-HUH. WHILE I'M
IN THE BACKYARD
WATCHING MRS. PATEL

07:43.158 --> 07:45.247

TILL IT'S TIME
TO MAKE A RUN
FOR CURRY TAKEOUT--

07:47.336 --> 07:49.033
WHICH IS FINE.
I LOVE CURRY.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.818
BUT NOT ON THANKSGIVING.

07:50.818 --> 07:52.733
OK.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.659
5 YEARS OLD, HUH?
THE FEARLESS 5s.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.661
THAT'S WHEN A LOT OF THEM
JUST START WANDERING OFF.

08:07.661 --> 08:09.663
NOT OWEN. HE'S NEVER
WANDERED OFF.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.621
AND I WENT BACK
TO THE TOY STORE
WHERE WE WERE.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.231
DID YOU TRY OVER
AT FOODWORLD?

08:13.231 --> 08:14.929
IN OTHER WORDS, THAT'S
WHERE A LOT OF THEM GO:

08:14.929 --> 08:16.278

PIZZA PARLOR--

08:16.278 --> 08:18.715
I'VE BEEN TO FOODWORLD.
YEAH. YES.

08:18.715 --> 08:22.414
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
TAKE IT SLOW, MR. SALINGER.

08:22.414 --> 08:24.199
I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE IT SLOW.

08:24.199 --> 08:28.290
WELL, WHAT WAS HE WEARING?
IN OTHER WORDS, HIS CLOTHES.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.683
IT'LL HELP US SPOT HIM.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.641

HE'S A LITTLE KID.
HE'S WEARING...

08:39.649 --> 08:41.303
SNEAKERS, I THINK.

08:41.303 --> 08:43.914
AND HE WAS WEARING THIS.

08:43.914 --> 08:47.048
UH, JEANS? OVERALLS?
WHAT COLOR
WAS HIS SHIRT?

08:47.048 --> 08:48.876
IN OTHER WORDS,

SOMETHING.

08:48.876 --> 08:52.270
IN OTHER WORDS,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT OWEN
WAS WEARING! OK?

08:54.490 --> 08:55.404
OK.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.496
CALL THE WIFE.
SHE'LL KNOW.

09:04.631 --> 09:09.418
CLAUDIA. N-NO.
NO, NO, NO. IT'S GREAT
THAT YOU CALLED.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.812
IT'S JUST--ACTUALLY,
I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE.

09:11.812 --> 09:14.815
UM, ARE YOU GONNA HAVE
A HAPPY THANKSGIVING?

09:14.815 --> 09:17.034
IT'S KIND OF HARD
BEING AWAY
ON THE HOLIDAYS, HUH?

09:17.034 --> 09:20.777
WELL, THIS PLACE
IS A COMPLETE MORGUE.

09:20.777 --> 09:23.432
I'M PRACTICALLY
THE ONLY ONE HERE.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.782
I JUST--
I MISS EVERYBODY.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.915
UH, NO, NO, NO.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.831

09:30.831 --> 09:33.398
YEAH, I GUESS I JUST LOOK
SO PATHETIC BEING HERE

09:33.398 --> 09:35.313
HE COULDN'T HELP
BUT ASK ME OVER.

09:35.313 --> 09:38.447
OH, UH, CLAUDIA,

EVERYBODY HERE'S
LOOKING FOR HIM,

09:57.031 --> 09:59.599
THE WHOLE SECURITY OFFICE
OR WHATEVER, BUT--

09:59.599 --> 10:01.165
CLAUDIA? WHAT ABOUT CLAUDIA?

10:01.165 --> 10:03.515
WELL, I-I'VE GOT HER
ON THE OTHER LINE.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.735
BUT I'LL GET OFF.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.868

ANYTHING'S WRONG, OK?

10:07.868 --> 10:09.260

10:17.094 --> 10:19.053

TO TALK TO HIM.

10:19.053 --> 10:20.576
HUH?

10:20.576 --> 10:22.056
THAT'S THE DOCTOR
ON THE OTHER LINE.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.274
ABOUT DIANA.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.276
NO, NO, NO.
NOTHING'S WRONG.

10:25.276 --> 10:27.888
IT'S JUST A WEEKLY
CHECKUP THING.

10:27.888 --> 10:29.890
UH, YEAH.
THAT'LL BE GREAT.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.848
OK, TALK TO YOU LATER.
FINE.

10:31.848 --> 10:34.242
CHARLIE, I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.244
HOW CAN HE BE LOST?

10:36.244 --> 10:39.116
NO, NO. I'M NOT.
I'M NOT PANICKING.

10:39.116 --> 10:41.118
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S WEARING.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.772
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT DRESSED HIM.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.732
OH, HOW LONG HAS HE
BEEN GONE, ANYWAY?

10:45.732 --> 10:48.082

10:55.524 --> 10:58.092
WHAT?SHH, DIANA, SHH.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.964
CHARLIE, HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT HE
WAS WEARING IF YOU DON'T?

11:00.964 --> 11:03.445
BLUE SWEATER. I SAW HIM
COME OUT OF THE BATHROOM
THIS MORNING.

11:03.445 --> 11:04.794
NO. HE TOOK THAT OFF.
WHAT ELSE?

11:04.794 --> 11:07.579
UM...OVERALLS, I THINK.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.059
NO, NO, NO.
STRIPED SHIRT.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.540
STRIPES GOING ACROSS
THIS WAY. TELL HIM.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.063
HE WAS WEARING
A STRIPED SHIRT,

11:13.063 --> 11:14.978
AND THE STRIPES WERE
GOING ACROSS HIS CHEST.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.719
WHAT'S WRONG?CHARLIE LOST OWEN
AT THE MALL.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.329
TELL HIM I'M COMING
OVER THERE.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.766
BAILEY'S ON HIS WAY.
I'M GOING WITH HIM.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.116
HE SAYS TO BRING
A PICTURE.

11:24.814 --> 11:29.645
OWEN SALINGER,
PLEASE GO TO THE NEAREST STORE
AND ASK FOR SECURITY.

11:29.645 --> 11:33.214
OWEN SALINGER, PLEASE
GO TO THE NEAREST STORE
AND ASK FOR SECURITY.

11:42.658 --> 11:46.793
UNIT THREE, CHANGE YOUR
FREQUENCY TO FOUR.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.751
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.
HE'S NOWHERE.

11:48.751 --> 11:49.796
KEEP YOUR EYES
ON THE SCREENS.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.667
IT'S BEEN 45 MINUTES!

11:51.667 --> 11:53.582
I MAKE IT 40.
TELL YOU WHAT,

11:53.582 --> 11:56.411
WE'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER 5,
THEN WE'LL CALL 9-1-1.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.761
THAT'S YOUR BIG PLAN?!

11:58.761 --> 12:00.197
I COULD'VE DONE
THAT MYSELF.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.417
I FIGURED YOU GUYS KNEW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING!

12:02.417 --> 12:04.898
HEY, ATTITUDE'S NOT
GONNA HELP US FIND
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER.

12:04.898 --> 12:09.076
DIAL THE NUMBER
9-1-1 NOW.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.339
UNIT TWO, SECOND FLOOR.

12:11.339 --> 12:14.211
UNIT TWO, SECOND FLOOR.

12:14.211 --> 12:16.474
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
THANKSGIVING IS LIKE
AROUND HERE.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.346
IT'S COMPLETE AND TOTAL CHAOS.

12:18.346 --> 12:19.913
EVERYBODY TALKING AT ONCE.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.219
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
GETTING GRILLED?

12:22.219 --> 12:25.309
NO ONE'S EVEN HAVING
ONE CONVERSATION LONG ENOUGH
TO GRILL ANYBODY.

12:25.309 --> 12:26.354
IT'S NUTS.

12:26.354 --> 12:28.530
IT SOUNDS NUTS.IT IS.

12:28.530 --> 12:31.576
IT'S GREAT.
YOU'LL LOVE IT.

12:31.576 --> 12:34.275
HEY, WHERE IS EVERYBODY?
ANYBODY HOME?!

12:38.888 --> 12:40.237
WHAT'S WRONG?

12:54.817 --> 12:56.863
Charlie: YOU'RE IT?

12:56.863 --> 12:58.821
MY BROTHER'S MISSING,
ANYTHING COULD'VE
HAPPENED TO HIM,

12:58.821 --> 13:00.649
AND THEY SEND OVER
ONE COP?

13:00.649 --> 13:02.216
WHEN YOU SAY ANYTHING
COULD'VE HAPPENED,

13:02.216 --> 13:03.957
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT MIGHT BE?

13:03.957 --> 13:05.915
IF I HAD, WOULD I
BE STANDING HERE
TALKING TO YOU?

13:05.915 --> 13:07.874
LOOK--
NO, YOU LOOK!

13:07.874 --> 13:12.008
YOU ASKED IF I'M IT,
WELL, YOUR ANSWER'S YES,
FOR NOW.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.662
I WAS DRIVING PATROL NEARBY,

13:13.662 --> 13:16.796
AND THEY RANG ME IN,
TENDER AGE MISSING.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.667
TENDER AGE?

13:18.667 --> 13:20.625
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL
A MISSING CHILD UNDER 10.

13:20.625 --> 13:24.020
LOOK, IF MORE UNITS
ARE NEEDED,
I'LL CALL FOR THEM,

13:24.020 --> 13:26.022
BUT RIGHT NOW I HAVE
A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.068
NOW, DO I HAVE
YOUR COOPERATION OR NOT?

13:28.068 --> 13:30.026
ALL RIGHT.

13:30.026 --> 13:33.029
WERE YOU FIGHTING?
YOU AND OWEN?

13:33.029 --> 13:34.030
FIGHTING?

13:34.030 --> 13:36.076
NO. NO.

13:36.076 --> 13:38.687
ANY REASON TO THINK
HE MIGHT RUN AWAY?

13:38.687 --> 13:41.690
RUN--NO. NO.
THAT IS SO UNLIKE HIM.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.692
WE WERE HAVING
A GREAT TIME.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.259
I PUT HIM ON
THE MERRY-GO-ROUND.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.043
AND THEN YOU MADE
A PHONE CALL.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.958
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

13:48.958 --> 13:52.048
ANY TROUBLE AT HOME LATELY?

13:52.048 --> 13:55.182
NO. NO TROUBLE AT HOME.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.577
EXCUSE ME, OFFICER, SIR.
I'M BAILEY SALINGER.

13:59.577 --> 14:02.145
YOU NEEDED SOME PICTURES
OF MY BROTHER.
GOOD.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.930
YOU GOT THE DESCRIPTION
OF THE SHIRT HE WAS
WEARING, RIGHT?

14:03.930 --> 14:06.106
STRIPES GOING ACROSS
HIS CHEST.
I GOT IT.

14:06.106 --> 14:08.195
I MIGHT AS WELL
LET YOU KNOW.

14:08.195 --> 14:10.893
I'M CALLING IN
MORE UNITS.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.199
GOOD.
MORE THE BETTER,
RIGHT?

14:12.199 --> 14:13.765
BECAUSE OF WHAT I SAID?

14:13.765 --> 14:15.811
WELL, WE PASSED THE HOUR
AND A QUARTER MARK.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.595
IF HE'S BEEN MISSING
THIS LONG

14:17.595 --> 14:19.380
AND YOU'RE SURE
HE'S NOT A RUNAWAY--

14:19.380 --> 14:21.338
A RUNAWAY?
HE'S NOT. DEFINITELY.

14:21.338 --> 14:23.993
THEN WE PROCEED
ON 2 ASSUMPTIONS.

14:23.993 --> 14:27.736
EITHER HE'S LOST,
OR IT'S A WORST CASE
SCENARIO.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.564
WORST CASE?

14:29.564 --> 14:30.826
WHAT IS THAT?

14:32.132 --> 14:34.308
THAT HE'S BEEN ABDUCTED.

14:41.445 --> 14:43.317
OK, IT'S CALLED
A GRID SEARCH.

14:43.317 --> 14:45.275
WE DIVIDE THE MALL UP
INTO SQUARES.

14:45.275 --> 14:48.104
AND ONE UNIFORM
WILL GO WITH A FAMILY
MEMBER OR A FRIEND,

14:48.104 --> 14:50.150
WE GO SQUARE BY SQUARE.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.761
IT'S PAINSTAKING, BUT
IT GETS THE JOB DONE.

14:52.761 --> 14:55.764
WE'VE MADE A FEW COPIES
OF OWEN'S PICTURE.

14:55.764 --> 14:58.767
YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO SHOW 'EM TO EVERYONE
YOU SEE.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.900
UH, WE'RE GONNA NEED
MORE COPIES.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.684
PAUL AND I
WILL MAKE THOSE.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.686
THERE'S A COPY SHOP
BY THE ESCALATOR.

15:04.686 --> 15:07.732
GOOD. LOOK, WE'RE
RACING THE CLOCK HERE.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.778
THE MALL CLOSES AT 1:00
FOR THANKSGIVING.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.911
AND THEN WE LOSE OUR
BEST SHOT AT WITNESSES
AND HIDING PLACES.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.521
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

15:13.521 --> 15:14.914
LET'S DO IT.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.177
- BAILEY, YOU GO WITH HIM.
- OK.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.743
AND YOU TWO STICK
WITH OFFICER SHAW.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.528
- ALL RIGHT.
- ANYBODY FINDS ANYTHING,

15:20.528 --> 15:22.356
I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT
IMMEDIATELY.

15:22.356 --> 15:23.661
OWEN...

15:25.402 --> 15:28.405
I COULDN'T SAY WHETHER
I SAW THIS KID OR NOT.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.407
LOOK, I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'D COME BY HERE.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.714
COULD YOU LOOK AT
THE PICTURE ONE MORE TIME?

15:32.714 --> 15:34.281
I JUST GAVE IT A LOOK.
I DON'T REMEMBER.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.326
EXCUSE ME.
IT'S MY TURN.

15:36.326 --> 15:40.374
WHAT DO YOU DO?
JUST SAY STUFF TO KIDS
WITHOUT LOOKING AT THEM?

15:40.374 --> 15:43.029
THEY SIT ON YOUR LAP,
SANTA, A WHOLE 2 INCHES
FROM YOUR FACE.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.334
I DON'T LOOK
TOO HARD, OK?

15:44.334 --> 15:45.640
IT'S A JOB.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.685
NO, YOU LOOK.
THIS IS MY BROTHER.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.122
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT
THIS PICTURE AGAIN
AND ASK YOURSELF--

15:49.122 --> 15:50.645
OFFICER, CAN YOU GET
THIS GUY OUT OF HERE?

15:50.645 --> 15:52.342
MR. SALINGER, COME ON.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:52.342 --> 15:53.778
SANTA HERE IS,
LIKE, "NO. NEVER
SEEN HIM BEFORE."

15:53.778 --> 15:55.389
HE BARELY
EVEN LOOKED
AT THE PICTURE.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.217
LET'S GET BACK TO WORK,
OK? COME ON.

15:57.217 --> 16:00.481
LET'S JUST CALM DOWN.
LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.178
AND LET'S FIND HIM,
OK?

16:02.178 --> 16:04.528
YEAH, I HEAR YOU.
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

16:04.528 --> 16:07.183
YOU'RE SAYING LET'S KEEP
OUR MINDS ON OWEN, LIKE YOU
DID THIS MORNING, RIGHT?

16:07.183 --> 16:09.142
ARE YOU SAYING I WASN'T
PAYING ATTENTION?

16:09.142 --> 16:10.926
HE WAS WITH YOU!

16:10.926 --> 16:12.884
HE GOT OFF
THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE MERRY-GO-ROUND.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.147
IT COULD'VE HAPPENED
TO ANYBODY.

16:14.147 --> 16:15.931
BUT IT NEVER DOES.I HAD HIM!

16:15.931 --> 16:17.628
I WAS WATCHING HIM. I WAS
ON THE PHONE FOR 2 MINUTES!

16:17.628 --> 16:19.935
2 MINUTES!
IT'S THANKSGIVING!

16:19.935 --> 16:22.807
YOU'RE IN A CROWDED MALL
WITH A 5-YEAR-OLD WHO'S
GOT A MIND OF HIS OWN.

16:22.807 --> 16:25.158
HOW COULD YOU TAKE YOUR EYES
OFF HIM FOR 2 SECONDS!

16:25.158 --> 16:26.637
IS THIS HELPING
TO FIND HIM, BAY,

16:26.637 --> 16:28.117
YOU HOT-HEADING
AROUND?

16:28.117 --> 16:30.119
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
HE WAS WEARING.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.208
I WAS HARDLY AWAKE
WHEN HE LEFT, AND I KNEW
BETTER THAN YOU DID.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.863
I HAD ABOUT 18 MILLION
THINGS ON MY MIND.

16:34.863 --> 16:37.822
YEAH. ONLY OWEN
WASN'T ONE OF THEM.

16:37.822 --> 16:38.998
WAS HE?

16:42.218 --> 16:45.656
I KNOW WHERE OWEN
LIKES TO GO. WHY CAN'T WE
CHECK THOSE PLACES?

16:45.656 --> 16:47.789
CHARLIE ALREADY
LOOKED AT ALL THE
PLACES OWEN LIKES.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.486
I KNOW BETTER THAN CHARLIE.
I BROUGHT OWEN HERE
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

16:49.486 --> 16:50.922
THIS GRID THING IS SO--

16:50.922 --> 16:52.402
IT'S JUST THE WAY
IT'S DONE.

16:52.402 --> 16:53.925
MAYBE IT SEEMS
INEFFICIENT, BUT--

16:53.925 --> 16:55.666
I DON'T CARE.
I KNOW WHERE HE'D GO.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.016
OK, FOR INSTANCE?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.974
GIVE HER A MOMENT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

16:58.974 --> 17:02.325
THERE'S A SPORTS STORE.
YOU KNOW, THEY SELL
TEAM GEAR.

17:02.325 --> 17:04.588
49ers SHIRTS, LIKE THAT.
WE COULD START THERE.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.329
OWEN AND FOOTBALL?

17:06.329 --> 17:07.983
HE'S ONLY 5. HE'S NOT
THAT INTO A SPORT YET.

17:07.983 --> 17:10.812
AIRPLANES! I WAS JUST
HELPING HIM FIX UP HIS ROOM.

17:10.812 --> 17:12.161
HE WANTED ME TO HANG UP
ALL THESE AIRPLANES.

17:12.161 --> 17:14.076
HE'S GOT, LIKE,
A HUNDRED OF THEM.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.947
REMEMBER LAST YEAR,
HE WORE AROUND
THAT SNOOPY AVIATOR CAP?

17:15.947 --> 17:17.514
RIGHT. I FORGOT. PLANES
ARE HIS THING RIGHT NOW.

17:17.514 --> 17:18.994
THERE'S A MODEL DEPARTMENT
IN HARVEY'S.

17:18.994 --> 17:22.867
OK, SO LONG AS ONE
OF YOU COMES WITH ME.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.307
YOU GUYS GO.

17:27.307 --> 17:28.699
LET'S DO IT.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.013
I TOOK THIS PICTURE.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.625
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.891
WE WERE AT THE BEACH,
IN BOLINAS.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.111
IT WAS THIS BEAUTIFUL DAY.

17:53.289 --> 17:56.118
I BRUSHED HIS HAIR
WHEN WE GOT HOME.

17:57.902 --> 18:01.297
IT WAS ALL WET,
'CAUSE HE WAS IN THE WATER.

18:04.039 --> 18:06.302
I TOLD HIM...

18:07.869 --> 18:09.740
"YOU HAVE SUCH
THICK HAIR, OWE."

18:13.875 --> 18:16.356
"THE GIRLS ARE GONNA
LOVE YOUR HAIR."

18:22.536 --> 18:25.365
I WAS TEASING HIM,
AND HE GOT ALL EMBARRASSED.

18:28.933 --> 18:29.934
KIRSTEN?

18:29.934 --> 18:32.807
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

18:35.853 --> 18:36.941
I'M OK.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.000
NO. THANKS.

18:54.698 --> 18:57.092
WE'RE SITTING HERE
DRINKING COFFEE.

18:57.092 --> 19:00.008
I SHOULD BE DOING
SOMETHING, ANYTHING
TO FIND HIM.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.749
YOU WANT TO FIND HIM?
YOUR BEST BET'S

19:01.749 --> 19:03.185
KEEPING YOUR EYE
ON THESE SCREENS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.322
I RAISED HIM.

19:11.889 --> 19:16.764
HE'S LIKE...THE LITTLE GUY
THAT'S ALWAYS THERE.

19:18.940 --> 19:22.770
I CAN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IF SOMETHING AWFUL
HAPPENED TO HIM.

19:26.034 --> 19:30.256
I DON'T HEAR YOU SAYING,
DON'T WORRY, WE'LL FIND
YOUR BROTHER.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.171
YOU WANT ME TO?

19:33.868 --> 19:36.740
LOOK, CHARLIE, CHANCES ARE
WE WILL FIND OWEN.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.879
I CAN'T SAY I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

19:44.879 --> 19:47.751
BUT I DO HAVE
2 CHILDREN OF MY OWN.

19:49.840 --> 19:50.754
WHAT AGE?

19:52.234 --> 19:53.757
A BOY OWEN'S AGE.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.239
AND A BABY GIRL.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.240
YEAH?

19:58.240 --> 19:59.502
YEAH.

19:59.502 --> 20:00.677
ME, TOO.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.244
BRAND-NEW.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.855
YEAH?

20:04.855 --> 20:08.903
SO NEITHER ONE OF US
IS GETTING ANY SLEEP.

20:08.903 --> 20:12.167
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I WAS ON THE PHONE
ABOUT HER WHEN...

20:14.909 --> 20:17.303
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WAS THAT STUPID.

20:17.303 --> 20:20.784
NOW, THERE'S A FIRST CLASS
WASTE OF TIME,
KICKING YOURSELF.

20:24.048 --> 20:28.096
I WANT US TO FIND HIM
IN THE NEXT HOUR.

20:28.096 --> 20:29.358
WHY?

20:31.317 --> 20:33.667
COME ON, YOU SAID THAT
LIKE IT WAS IMPORTANT,

20:33.667 --> 20:35.321
"IN THE NEXT HOUR."

20:35.321 --> 20:37.323
THAT'S WHEN THE SHIFT
ENDS AT THE PRECINCT.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.325
AND THEN THE NEXT SHIFT
TAKES OVER, RIGHT?

20:39.325 --> 20:41.283
AND THE NEXT COPS
TAKE OVER WHERE
THESE LEFT OFF?

20:41.283 --> 20:42.502
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.244
MISSING PERSONS TAKES IT.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.594
OK, MISSING PERSONS.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

20:47.594 --> 20:49.596
MISSING PERSONS
TAKES A LOT OF CASES.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.467
RUNAWAY HOUSEWIVES
KIND OF THING.

20:51.467 --> 20:54.470
AND PLUS THIS HOLIDAY
DOESN'T HELP US.

20:54.470 --> 20:57.168
WE DON'T GET A FULL FORCE
TILL MONDAY.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.392
SO IF WE DON'T FIND HIM
IN THE NEXT HOUR--

21:03.392 --> 21:04.915
SO LET'S FIND HIM, OK?

21:15.143 --> 21:16.927
BE THERE. BE THERE.

21:18.712 --> 21:21.062
[RING]

21:21.062 --> 21:21.976
DAMN.

21:25.458 --> 21:29.113
SARAH. SARAH,
WHEN YOU GET THIS,

21:29.113 --> 21:31.464
IT'S NOT...

21:31.464 --> 21:35.119
I DON'T MEAN TO BOTHER YOU,
BUT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

21:35.119 --> 21:37.252
OWEN'S LOST...
AT THE GALLERIA MALL.

21:37.252 --> 21:40.081
AND WE'RE ALL HERE,
ALL OF US, LOOKING FOR HIM.

21:40.081 --> 21:42.083
BUT EVERY SET
OF EYES HELPS.

21:42.083 --> 21:46.435
AND...WE NEED YOU,
OR I WOULDN'T CALL.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.178
I NEED YOU.

21:50.178 --> 21:51.875
[RING]

21:53.921 --> 21:54.922
CHARLIE?

21:54.922 --> 21:55.966
DAPHNE?

21:55.966 --> 21:57.185
NOPE. IT'S ME.

21:57.185 --> 22:00.014
CLAUDIA, HI.

22:00.014 --> 22:03.147
WHY'D YOU ASK
IF IT WAS CHARLIE?
ISN'T HE THERE?

22:03.147 --> 22:05.193
HE...

22:05.193 --> 22:07.891
OK, LOOK, I FIGURE SOMEBODY'S
GOTTA BE THERE BY NOW.

22:07.891 --> 22:09.632
I MEAN,
THIS IS THANKSGIVING.

22:09.632 --> 22:14.245
LOUSY LUCK, CLAUD.
EVERYONE, UH,
SUDDENLY DECIDED

22:14.245 --> 22:17.161
THAT THEY NEEDED TO GET
SOMETHING AT THE STORE
BEFORE IT CLOSED.

22:17.161 --> 22:22.819
HEY, UM, I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE MAKING SOME YAMS.

22:22.819 --> 22:25.082
LOOK, THIS SOUNDS
A LITTLE TOO WEIRD.
IS EVERYTHING OK THERE?

22:25.082 --> 22:27.737
OH, SURE, SURE.
WHAT COULD BE WRONG?

22:27.737 --> 22:31.567
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT COOKING YAMS?

22:31.567 --> 22:33.874
'CAUSE ME,
I DON'T HAVE A CLUE.

22:33.874 --> 22:36.355
YAMS? OK.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.921
YOU GOT A BAKING PAN?

22:39.880 --> 22:42.012
NOW, WHERE WOULD
THAT BE?

22:42.012 --> 22:43.840
EXCUSE ME, SIR. CAN YOU
HAVE A LOOK AT THAT?

22:43.840 --> 22:45.668
PLEASE? EXCUSE ME.
THIS LITTLE BOY
IS MISSING.

22:45.668 --> 22:47.191
IF YOU CAN HAVE
A LOOK AT THAT, PLEASE?

22:47.191 --> 22:49.150
I'M MISSING THIS LITTLE BOY.
MY BROTHER.

22:49.150 --> 22:50.717
BOY NOT OK.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.980
BOY NOT--NOT OK.
THIS BOY NOT OK?

22:52.980 --> 22:54.198
BOY NOT GOOD.
BOY NOT OK.

22:54.198 --> 22:55.591
WHAT DID YOU SEE,
MA'AM?

22:55.591 --> 22:57.463
MY MOTHER DOESN'T
SPEAK ENGLISH.

22:57.463 --> 23:00.117
CAN YOU ASK HER FOR US
WHAT SHE SAW, PLEASE?

23:00.117 --> 23:03.338
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

23:03.338 --> 23:06.385
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

23:08.387 --> 23:12.216
MY MOM SAW A BOY BEING
DRAGGED OUT OF THE MALL
BY A MAN.

23:12.216 --> 23:14.131
THE BOY WAS CRYING,
BUT SHE DOESN'T

23:14.131 --> 23:15.872
RECOGNIZE THE BOY
IN THE PICTURE.

23:15.872 --> 23:17.439
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?

23:17.439 --> 23:19.441
NO. I WASN'T WITH HER.

23:19.441 --> 23:22.052
WHAT ABOUT HIS CLOTHES,
WHAT WAS HE WEARING?
COULD YOU ASK HER?

23:22.052 --> 23:25.360
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

23:25.360 --> 23:28.015
[SPEAKING CHINESE]

23:28.015 --> 23:30.496
SHE SAW-- THE BOY WAS--I KNOW. I KNOW I SAW.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.062
BOY CRYING.
BOY NOT OK.

23:32.062 --> 23:34.282
Officer:
WE NEED TO GET HER
TO FLAHERTY NOW.

23:38.155 --> 23:40.288
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

23:40.288 --> 23:42.943
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE TO
SWEAT THE SHIFT CHANGE.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.945
WE'VE GOT THE WHOLE
NEXT SHIFT AT OUR DISPOSAL.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.337
WHY'S THAT?

23:46.337 --> 23:48.035
BECAUSE WHAT
MRS. CHAO SAW QUALIFIES

23:48.035 --> 23:49.776
AS A POSITIVE INDICATION
OF ABDUCTION.

23:49.776 --> 23:52.082
THAT BUYS US
EVERY COP IN TOWN.

23:52.082 --> 23:53.562
WHAT DID SHE SEE?

23:53.562 --> 23:55.869
A BOY THAT MAY
OR MAY NOT BE OWEN.

23:55.869 --> 23:58.219
BUT WHAT ABOUT
HIS SHIRT?

23:58.219 --> 24:00.700
THERE'S A LOT OF STRIPED
SHIRTS AROUND. THAT'S NOT
THE PART THAT SCARES US.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.179
WHAT IS IT.
WHAT SCARES YOU?

24:02.179 --> 24:03.572
THE MAN WHO'S
DRAGGING THE BOY OFF.

24:03.572 --> 24:06.227
CAUCASIAN, HEAVY-SET,
VERY HEAVY-SET,

24:06.227 --> 24:08.577
SHOULDER LENGTH HAIR...YEAH, SO?

24:08.577 --> 24:09.970
SO THERE WAS ANOTHER
CASE OF ABDUCTION

24:09.970 --> 24:12.146
ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO,
1/4 MILE FROM HERE.

24:12.146 --> 24:15.845
THE MAN THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
FITS THAT DESCRIPTION.

24:15.845 --> 24:16.977
ABDUCTION.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.413
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

24:18.413 --> 24:20.763
OK, NOW WE SPLIT UP.

24:20.763 --> 24:22.417
SOME OF US WILL
STAY HERE IN THE MALL.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.550
THIS COULD ALL BE
JUST A COINCIDENCE.

24:24.550 --> 24:27.030
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
WE WIDEN THE SEARCH TO
THE SURROUNDING STREETS.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.685
NOW, SOME OF YOU WILL GO
IN THE SQUAD CARS.

24:29.685 --> 24:32.993
LET'S SAY 2 TO A UNIT.
OUR BOYS COULD USE THE HELP.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.952
NOT YOU. YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR JOB IS.

24:35.952 --> 24:38.259
YOU I'M GOING TO NEED ON
A SEARCH OF THE BASEMENT.

24:38.259 --> 24:40.174
THEN WHO'S GONNA GO
WITH THE UNITS?

24:40.174 --> 24:41.218
I'LL GO.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.829
YOU DON'T KNOW OWEN.

24:42.829 --> 24:45.484
AND I'LL GO.
HE SAID 2 TO A UNIT.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.051
THEN THAT'S THE TEAM.
LET'S DO IT, PEOPLE.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.895
COME ON, LET'S CHECK
OUT THIS BUILDING.

25:05.895 --> 25:09.638
CONSTRUCTION SITES,
RAILROAD YARDS,
ABANDONED BUILDINGS,

25:09.638 --> 25:11.597
WE CALL THEM
"ATTRACTIVE NUISANCES."

25:11.597 --> 25:13.163
IT'S WHERE KIDS
SOMETIMES HANG OUT.

25:13.163 --> 25:15.078
AND HOMELESS PEOPLE,
TOO, LOOKS LIKE.

25:15.078 --> 25:17.211
YEAH. I'LL TALK
TO THESE GUYS.

25:17.211 --> 25:20.170
YOU TWO WALK ROUND
THE PERIMETER. HOLLER
IF YOU FIND SOMETHING.

25:20.170 --> 25:22.651
Griffin: RED SNEAKERS.HUH?

25:22.651 --> 25:24.827
I JUST REMEMBERED.
THAT'S ALL HE'S BEEN
WEARING LATELY.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.873
I DON'T KNOW IF
ANYBODY BOTHERED TO
TELL THE COPS THAT.

25:26.873 --> 25:28.918
THIS SCAFFOLDING'S
DANGEROUS.

25:28.918 --> 25:31.181
I HOPE HE'S NOT STUPID
ENOUGH TO BE WANDERING
AROUND IN HERE.

25:31.181 --> 25:33.183
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK HE'S
DOING, WANDERING AROUND,

25:33.183 --> 25:35.098
INSTEAD OF BEING GRABBED
BY SOMEBODY?

25:35.098 --> 25:36.752
I DON'T KNOW.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.754
OWEN WOULDN'T WANDER
OFF LIKE THAT.

25:38.754 --> 25:41.757
I KNOW YOU THINK THAT
'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

25:41.757 --> 25:45.108
YEAH, AND YOU DO.

25:45.108 --> 25:47.023
AS A MATTER
OF FACT--

25:47.023 --> 25:48.851
UH-HUH.
I TOTALLY GET THAT.

25:48.851 --> 25:51.811
YOU KNOW ABOUT
HIS RED SNEAKERS,
HIS AIRPLANES,

25:51.811 --> 25:53.508
WHAT HE'D DO,
WHAT HE WOULDN'T DO.

25:53.508 --> 25:55.858
YOU KNOW HOW THE ENTIRE
FAMILY WORKS.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.904
YEAH. YEAH, I DO,
SINCE I WAS MARRIED
AWHILE,

25:57.904 --> 25:59.558
AM MARRIED TO JULIA.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.082
WHEREAS I'M THE GUY
WHO'S WITH HER NOW.

26:06.956 --> 26:10.656
WHY DON'T WE SPLIT UP,
CIRCLE AROUND,
COME BACK?

26:19.926 --> 26:21.797
[RING]

26:27.281 --> 26:28.543
HELLO?

26:28.543 --> 26:29.936
DAPHNE, IT'S ME.

26:29.936 --> 26:31.677
OK, PUT ME ON WITH
SOMEBODY NOW, OK?

26:31.677 --> 26:32.982
I'M, LIKE, DYING HERE.

26:32.982 --> 26:35.158
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU CALLED, ONLY--

26:35.158 --> 26:36.812
ONLY WHAT?

26:36.812 --> 26:38.466
DON'T TELL ME THERE'S
STILL NO ONE THERE.

26:38.466 --> 26:41.687
COME ON, DAPHNE, PLEASE
PUT ME ON WITH SOMEONE.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.689
PLEASE LET ME TALK
TO SOMEONE. I MEAN,

26:43.689 --> 26:45.691
I KNOW HOW THANKSGIVING
WORKS IN MY OWN FAMILY.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.693
AND EITHER SOMEONE'S THERE,
OR SOMETHING'S WRONG.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.915
I'M MAKING THESE
PIE CRUSTS,

26:52.915 --> 26:56.876
AND I'M HAVING
THIS DILEMMA BETWEEN
BUTTER VERSUS LARD.

26:56.876 --> 27:00.923
DAPHNE, PUT SOMEBODY ON.

27:00.923 --> 27:04.361
I CAN'T.

27:04.361 --> 27:05.275
OH, MY--

27:12.456 --> 27:14.415
IS SOMETHING WRONG,
CLAUDIA?

27:14.415 --> 27:17.461
CLAUDIA. CLAUDIA,
YOU GOTTA CALM DOWN.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.072
THAT'S THE FIRST THING, OK?

27:19.072 --> 27:21.117
LISTEN TO ME, WE'RE
ALL HERE LOOKING,

27:21.117 --> 27:23.424
AND THERE ARE LOTS
OF POLICE OFFICERS, OK?

27:23.424 --> 27:25.382
CLAUDIA, YOU THERE?

27:25.382 --> 27:28.472
I'M HERE, BUT I'M
COMING THERE, BAILEY.

27:28.472 --> 27:30.474
DON'T EVEN TRY
AND TALK ME OUT OF IT.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.869
THIS JUST SHOWS
I'VE GOT TO BE THERE
WHEN THIS STUFF HAPPENS.

27:33.869 --> 27:36.393
NO! CLAUDIA,
YOU STAY THERE.

27:36.393 --> 27:37.917
THAT'S THE LAST
THING WE NEED.

27:37.917 --> 27:38.918
YOU STAY THERE.

27:38.918 --> 27:42.225
NO! I'M SCARED FOR OWEN.

27:42.225 --> 27:44.924
I KNOW, BUT WE'RE GONNA
FIND OWEN ANY MINUTE,

27:44.924 --> 27:46.577
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
ON A PLANE COMING HERE.

27:46.577 --> 27:48.188
THAT DOESN'T EVEN
MAKE SENSE, RIGHT?

27:48.188 --> 27:49.798
Officer: SIR, COME ON.

27:49.798 --> 27:52.279
OK? CLAUD?

28:01.418 --> 28:02.593
THANK YOU.

28:02.593 --> 28:04.595
EXCUSE ME, MISS?LEAVE ME ALONE.

28:04.595 --> 28:07.163
I WAS ONLY ASKING--I SAID STAY AWAY FROM ME.

28:07.163 --> 28:09.383
I SHOULD CALL THE POLICE.
THEY SHOULDN'T ALLOW
SOLICITORS IN THE MALL.

28:09.383 --> 28:10.819
PAUL, WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:10.819 --> 28:12.212
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

28:12.212 --> 28:14.170
TAKE IT. LOOK AT IT.

28:14.170 --> 28:16.869
IT'S NOT A 40% OFF SALE, LADY.
IT'S A KID, OK? SEE?

28:16.869 --> 28:18.740
KIRSTEN, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
JUST LET IT GO.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.829
GO AHEAD, MA'AM.
WE'RE SORRY.
WE APOLOGIZE.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.570
DON'T APOLOGIZE.
SHE'S--

28:22.570 --> 28:24.441
HOW CAN YOU SAY
I'M SORRY TO HER?

28:24.441 --> 28:25.529
YOU'RE HYSTERICAL.

28:25.529 --> 28:26.792
I AM NOT HYSTERICAL!

28:26.792 --> 28:28.968
I AM ANGRY,
AND I'M UPSET!

28:28.968 --> 28:31.535
AND SO WHAT
IF I'M HYSTERICAL?
OWEN'S LOST!

28:31.535 --> 28:35.888
I CAN'T BE LIKE YOU,
ALL CALM AND
APOLOGIZING TO THESE

28:35.888 --> 28:37.890
SELFISH,
DAMN PEOPLE.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.456
JUST CALM DOWN.

28:39.456 --> 28:42.242
DON'T TELL ME
TO CALM DOWN.

28:42.242 --> 28:45.245
AND DON'T APOLOGIZE
FOR ME AGAIN, EVER!

28:45.245 --> 28:46.420
EVER!

28:52.513 --> 28:54.080
THERE'S, LIKE, A MILE
OF HALLWAY DOWN THERE.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.908
WE WALKED IT ALL.
THERE'S NOTHING.

28:55.908 --> 29:00.826
AND, CHARLIE,
DAPHNE TOLD CLAUDIA
ON THE PHONE.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.829
YOUR DAPHNE
TOLD CLAUDIA,
3,000 MILES AWAY.

29:03.829 --> 29:06.092
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?
HUH?

29:06.092 --> 29:08.181
WHAT PURPOSE DOES
THAT POSSIBLY SERVE?

29:08.181 --> 29:10.009
WHAT?

29:10.009 --> 29:12.663
MAYBE CLAUDIA HAS
A RIGHT TO KNOW.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.622
NOW, SHOULDN'T YOU GET
OUT THERE AND LOOK--

29:14.622 --> 29:16.232
SO YOU'RE DEFENDING
DAPHNE?

29:17.712 --> 29:19.932
WHY SHOULD I HAVE
TO DEFEND DAPHNE?

29:19.932 --> 29:23.674
BECAUSE TELLING CLAUDIA
WAS A DAMN, STUPID THING
TO DO, THAT'S WHY.

29:23.674 --> 29:25.676
SO SHE SCREWED UP.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.374
SO I SCREWED UP.

29:27.374 --> 29:29.811
EVERYBODY, BUT YOU, RIGHT?
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU GET--

29:29.811 --> 29:31.378
YOU WANT TO GET MAD?
GET MAD AT YOURSELF.

29:31.378 --> 29:33.336
DON'T YOU THINK I AM?!

29:33.336 --> 29:34.250
HUH?

29:40.082 --> 29:42.128
I JUST SPOKE TO DISPATCH.

29:42.128 --> 29:45.348
BAYVIEW HOSPITAL.
A BOY'S BEEN BROUGHT IN
IN A COMA.

29:48.917 --> 29:50.310
IS HE OWEN?

29:50.310 --> 29:51.311
NO CLOTHING.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.313
NO CLOTHING?

29:53.313 --> 29:55.271
IT'D BEEN REMOVED, AND
THE BOY'S BEEN BEATEN BADLY.

29:55.271 --> 29:56.925
OH, MY GOD.

29:56.925 --> 29:58.971
SO BADLY THEY CAN'T I.D. HIM
OFF THE PICTURE.

29:58.971 --> 30:01.974
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT ONE OF YOU CAN'T.

30:01.974 --> 30:04.715
I NEED ONE OF YOU
TO GO DOWN THERE.

30:04.715 --> 30:06.021
I'M GONNA GO OVER THERE.

30:06.021 --> 30:08.110
NO.
YOU'RE ON THE MONITORS.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.808
YOU STAY ON THE MONITORS.
I'LL GO.

30:09.808 --> 30:14.073
I'LL CALL YOU
AS SOON AS...I'VE SEEN HIM.

30:14.073 --> 30:15.726
TAKE SOMEONE WITH YOU.

30:15.726 --> 30:18.120
YOU'LL BE LOOKING AT
A BATTERED CHILD.

30:18.120 --> 30:21.210
EVEN IF IT'S NOT OWEN,
IT'LL BE THE WORST THING
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

30:21.210 --> 30:23.038
YOU'LL NEED SOMEONE THERE.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.997
I'LL GO WITH HIM.

30:44.059 --> 30:45.626
THIS WAY.

31:00.946 --> 31:03.992
I--I CAN'T SEE HIS FACE.
IT'S ALL BANDAGED.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.602
WELL, THAT'S
FOR THE LIGHT.
I CAN LIFT THAT UP.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.126
NO, NO.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.215
IT WON'T HURT.
JUST SO YOU CAN SEE.

31:13.088 --> 31:17.701
SHALL I MOVE ASIDE?
DO YOU NEED TO COME
ANY CLOSER?

31:17.701 --> 31:20.008
NO, I DON'T NEED TO COME
ANY CLOSER.

31:20.008 --> 31:22.402
OH, MY GOD...

31:22.402 --> 31:24.926
BAILEY?

31:24.926 --> 31:28.887
IT'S NOT HIM.
IT'S NOT OWEN.

31:33.717 --> 31:34.762
COME ON.

31:34.762 --> 31:35.850
I GOTTA CALL CHARLIE.

31:39.854 --> 31:42.204
THANK GOD THAT ISN'T OWEN.

31:42.204 --> 31:46.600
IT'S SOMEBODY'S OWEN,
RIGHT?

31:46.600 --> 31:50.038
RIGHT? I MEAN,
SOMEBODY'S GONNA
COME HERE,

31:50.038 --> 31:51.953
AND THEY'RE GONNA HOPE
THAT'S NOT THEIR BABY,
