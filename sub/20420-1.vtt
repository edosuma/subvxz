WEBVTT

00:03.469 --> 00:04.703
- And then he'll enter
from over here,

00:04.704 --> 00:06.205
and you're gonna
wanna stand here,

00:06.206 --> 00:08.240
probably a low angle, maybe
an 85 millimeter I'd say.

00:08.241 --> 00:09.507
And where'd the lady go?

00:09.508 --> 00:10.709
- Here.

00:10.710 --> 00:13.180
- Okay, sweetheart
come here, sit.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.447
What do you like to eat?

00:15.448 --> 00:17.250
- Um, poached eggs.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.617
- Scrambled looks
better on camera.

00:19.618 --> 00:21.520
Get her a scrambled eggs, wet.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.588
Now, when he comes in,
you're very surprised, okay?

00:23.589 --> 00:24.423
- But I already know that he's...

00:24.424 --> 00:25.958
- You're very surprised.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.927
You never expected that a
handsome important man like him

00:28.928 --> 00:31.429
would come into your
little diner of all places,

00:31.430 --> 00:32.764
and he's gonna sit
down next to you.

00:32.765 --> 00:34.299
And you're gonna wanna
get a two-shot of them

00:34.300 --> 00:36.068
talking from here, and...

00:36.069 --> 00:37.374
No, no no, not yet!

00:41.374 --> 00:43.411
Get her another one.

00:45.411 --> 00:47.546
- You know what else
I'm not gonna miss?

00:47.547 --> 00:49.481
- Besides him?

00:49.482 --> 00:50.482
- Diner coffee.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.417
- I know that's right.

00:52.418 --> 00:54.386
- How hard is it
to make a good cup?

00:54.387 --> 00:56.488
You just grind the beans,
pour the water over it.

00:56.489 --> 00:58.957
It's not like it takes a
genius to make a good cup.

00:58.958 --> 01:00.425
- Right.

01:00.426 --> 01:02.827
- Hey gang, what's
for breakfast?

01:02.828 --> 01:04.595
- Senator Kenny Weston!

01:04.596 --> 01:06.565
- That's right, hey it's
good to see you, folks.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.433
How you doing?

01:07.434 --> 01:10.068
Ooh, you got the sausage.
That looks good!

01:10.069 --> 01:12.003
Excuse me, ma'am,
is this seat taken?

01:12.004 --> 01:13.238
All yours, Senator.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.306
- Well thank you.

01:14.307 --> 01:16.074
Hey, don't mind me, folks.

01:16.075 --> 01:19.411
I just dropped by
for a little chow.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.645
Well, hi there, Miss.

01:20.646 --> 01:22.280
- Morning, what can
I get you, Senator?

01:22.281 --> 01:24.081
- Uh, let's see, well
I will take the same

01:24.082 --> 01:25.583
as this lovely lady's having.

01:25.584 --> 01:27.752
Plus a cup of your most
delicious coffee, please.

01:27.753 --> 01:28.587
- Coming right up.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.988
- Thank you.

01:29.989 --> 01:32.257
And what is your
name, sweetheart?

01:32.258 --> 01:33.491
- I'm Betty Bauser.

01:33.492 --> 01:35.660
- Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Betty.

01:35.661 --> 01:39.096
Now is that B-O-W-S-E-R,
like the dog?

01:39.097 --> 01:41.001
- No, it's B-A-U-S-E-R.

01:42.001 --> 01:43.768
- Oh yeah, of course.

01:43.769 --> 01:45.537
You know, I once
knew a Bob Brauer,

01:45.538 --> 01:47.805
terrific tax lawyer
out of Dallas.

01:47.806 --> 01:49.374
I don't suppose
you're any relation.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.609
- No, I don't recall
having any relatives...

01:51.610 --> 01:53.610
- Don't listen to him, Betty.

01:53.611 --> 01:54.845
- Oh, shit.

01:54.846 --> 01:56.981
- He's a goddamn liar.

01:56.982 --> 01:58.283
- Oh...

01:58.284 --> 02:00.385
- He
voted for it nine times!

02:00.386 --> 02:01.952
- Oh, not again.

02:01.953 --> 02:02.954
- Nine
times, you can look it up!

02:02.955 --> 02:04.455
- Shut up, Earl.

02:04.456 --> 02:06.157
- My friend, if you would
like to discuss this calmly,

02:06.158 --> 02:07.359
I'd be glad to answer...

02:07.360 --> 02:09.293
- He wants to take away
our freedom, Betty.

02:09.294 --> 02:11.228
That's how it all starts!

02:11.229 --> 02:12.964
They check up on
your background.

02:12.965 --> 02:15.234
Then they roll in the
tanks and the artillery.

02:15.235 --> 02:16.168
Mark my words!

02:16.169 --> 02:17.869
- Earl, I told you to shut up!

02:17.870 --> 02:20.537
It's not bad enough I have
to listen to you 23 years.

02:20.538 --> 02:22.507
- Now, nobody's gonna take
away your freedom, my friend.

02:22.508 --> 02:25.175
In fact, I am a strong supporter
of the Second Amendment.

02:25.176 --> 02:27.411
- Like hell, you
voted nine times!

02:27.412 --> 02:28.645
- Sir, if I could talk to you

02:28.646 --> 02:29.315
for a moment privately.
- I got nothing

02:29.316 --> 02:30.382
to say to you.

02:30.383 --> 02:31.549
Listen to me!

02:31.550 --> 02:33.050
We're all gonna be
slaves inside of a year!

02:33.051 --> 02:34.418
- Earl!
- I'm gonna ask you to leave.

02:34.419 --> 02:35.553
- They got giant lizard people

02:35.554 --> 02:36.389
running the Federal Reserve.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.522
I've seen pictures.

02:37.523 --> 02:40.191
Get your goddamn
reptile hands off of me!

02:40.192 --> 02:44.162
- Earl! Ohhh!

02:44.163 --> 02:45.996
- Okay folks, wee
gonna move on from here.

02:45.997 --> 02:47.332
It was very nice
to meet everyone.

02:48.268 --> 02:50.668

Kenny Weston tonight,

05:04.136 --> 05:07.205
as a heckler disrupts
a routine photo op

05:07.206 --> 05:08.472
in a small town diner.

05:08.473 --> 05:10.308
Take a look at this
exclusive video,

05:10.309 --> 05:12.309
obtained by our news team.

05:12.310 --> 05:15.479
- pictures, get your
reptile hands off of me!

05:15.480 --> 05:17.715
- Earl! Ohhh!

05:17.716 --> 05:19.818
- Joining me now to
help make sense of
it all

05:19.819 --> 05:22.419
are our distinguished
panel of political experts.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.222
Thank you all for being here.

05:24.223 --> 05:25.989
To you first, Tom Tishkin.

05:25.990 --> 05:29.761
Is it time to write the
obituary on the Weston campaign?

05:29.762 --> 05:31.263
- If not the obituary,

05:31.264 --> 05:33.832
at least the do not
resuscitate order.

05:33.833 --> 05:34.833
- Good one, Tom.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.835
Rolando Iglesias, your thoughts?

05:36.836 --> 05:40.205
- Well look, the optics on
this are absolutely terrible
for...

05:40.206 --> 05:41.905
- Well, shoot.

05:41.906 --> 05:42.841
- We should pack it in.

05:42.841 --> 05:43.774
- I'm with Nic.

05:43.775 --> 05:45.042
- Not so fast.

05:45.043 --> 05:46.410
- Not so fast?

05:46.411 --> 05:48.578
We've been doing
this for two years.

05:48.579 --> 05:51.015
- That's because you haven't
been stroking the base enough.

05:51.016 --> 05:52.415
That heckler could
have been a supporter.

05:52.416 --> 05:53.917
- That heckler was a whack job.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.953
- Maybe, but he represents
a key demographic.

05:55.954 --> 05:58.422
- The delusional?

05:58.423 --> 06:00.023
- Look, Kenny it's
like I've been saying.

06:00.024 --> 06:02.260
This is the perfect time to
reboot and move right.

06:02.261 --> 06:04.195
- Um, he has a voting
record, remember?

06:04.196 --> 06:06.763
- Right, he's a moderate
inclusive Republican.

06:06.764 --> 06:08.400
That's always been our brand.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.201
- Well, I'm sorry, but
your brand is boring.

06:10.202 --> 06:11.869
People wanna feel something.

06:11.870 --> 06:13.403
It's like Atwater said,

06:13.404 --> 06:16.073
"Grab 'em by the balls and
their votes will follow."

06:16.074 --> 06:18.042
- Yeah, like that's really
gonna help with the gender gap.

06:18.043 --> 06:20.646
- Shh, I'm trying to think.

06:21.646 --> 06:23.481
Yeah, I don't know,
what do you think?

06:23.482 --> 06:24.715
- Look, once you
get the nomination,

06:24.716 --> 06:25.982
you can take any
lukewarm bullshit

06:25.983 --> 06:27.552
middle of the road
position you want.

06:27.553 --> 06:28.719
But for now...

06:28.720 --> 06:30.754
- No, he can't,
it's all on YouTube.

06:30.755 --> 06:32.390
- They'll flip-flop us.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.657
- Alright, well maybe we

06:33.658 --> 06:35.559
after we see how things
go at the megachurch.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.893
- The Megachurch cancelled.

06:36.894 --> 06:38.462
- What?

06:38.463 --> 06:40.063
- They heard about the diner,

06:40.064 --> 06:42.066
but I was able to get
us another church.

06:42.067 --> 06:43.067
- Where?

06:43.068 --> 06:44.402
- It's little off the beaten
track,

06:44.403 --> 06:46.838
but, the pastor's very
excited to meet you.

06:46.839 --> 06:48.573
- Oh, we should just cancel.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.241
- You cancel that rally,
you send up a white flag.

06:51.242 --> 06:54.244
- Alright, alright,
we'll do the church.

06:54.245 --> 06:56.250
Just get it over with, alright?

07:03.923 --> 07:06.823
- Heavenly father, we
are so blessed to have

07:06.824 --> 07:09.027
Senator Kenny Weston and
his distinguished colleagues

07:09.028 --> 07:10.927
here with us today.

07:10.928 --> 07:13.297
Please grant them
good health and wisdom

07:13.298 --> 07:16.600
as they seek the leadership
of this great land.

07:16.601 --> 07:20.604
Lord, we ask your help
in guiding us to choose

07:20.605 --> 07:22.941
the best steward of thy people,

07:22.942 --> 07:24.809
the candidate best
able to restore

07:24.810 --> 07:27.145
and strengthen our
American family.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.679
For we know it
true that a nation

07:29.680 --> 07:32.452
is only as strong as its homes.

07:33.452 --> 07:35.953
Father, we know
that this election

07:35.954 --> 07:37.989
may be the most
important election

07:37.990 --> 07:39.624
in our lifetime.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.525
With so much at stake,

07:41.526 --> 07:43.359
and so many things
seem to be changing

07:43.360 --> 07:45.296
in the wrong direction lately.

07:45.297 --> 07:48.465
Help us protect
this precious land.

07:48.466 --> 07:51.703
In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

07:51.704 --> 07:52.704
- Amen.

07:54.206 --> 07:56.708
- Well, Senator, I'm sure
the people here are anxious

07:56.709 --> 07:59.410
to ask you questions
about important issues,

07:59.411 --> 08:01.011
but before we do that

08:01.012 --> 08:03.347
we have a special
surprise for you.

08:03.348 --> 08:07.150
- Oh, well I sure hope
it doesn't involve eggs.

08:09.588 --> 08:11.189
- I promise, no eggs this time,

08:11.190 --> 08:14.691
but in appreciation of your
long service for our country

08:14.692 --> 08:16.326
our congregation would
like to offer you

08:16.327 --> 08:19.429
a patriotic serenade
written and composed,

08:19.430 --> 08:22.398

boast just a little bit,

08:22.399 --> 08:25.170
by my lovely daughter, Liberty,

08:26.170 --> 08:27.438
who as a matter of fact
wrote the whole thing

08:27.439 --> 08:29.441
when she was all
of 12 years old.

08:29.442 --> 08:30.607
- Is that right?

08:30.608 --> 08:31.676
- Oy vey.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.244

stupid fundamentalist.

10:38.504 --> 10:39.903
- Exactly.

10:39.904 --> 10:41.572
And she's from a
battleground state,

10:41.573 --> 10:42.739
not to mention
she's totally hot,

10:42.740 --> 10:44.475
which seals the Bubba vote.

10:44.476 --> 10:46.543
- Not to mention, you're a pig.

10:46.544 --> 10:49.247
- Oh, sticks and stones.

10:49.248 --> 10:51.481
- Alright, that's
enough of that, you two.

10:51.482 --> 10:53.584
- Kenny, I'm telling you, this
is our once chance to win.

10:53.585 --> 10:56.019
- What, American Idol?

10:56.020 --> 10:57.488
- What about the issues?

10:57.489 --> 10:58.989
What about our agenda?

10:58.990 --> 11:00.825
Remember "The New
Party of Lincoln?"

11:00.826 --> 11:02.692
- Look, you can forget
about your agenda

11:02.693 --> 11:04.027
if we don't get that nomination.

11:04.028 --> 11:05.495
And the only way
we're gonna get it

11:05.496 --> 11:07.731
is by splitting off the
bible nuts or Tea Partiers.

11:07.732 --> 11:09.834
- No way those people
are gonna vote for Kenny.

11:09.835 --> 11:13.838
- Yeah, but they might
vote for Liberty.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.906
- You still won't
have enough delegates.

11:15.907 --> 11:18.508
- Nobody does, so we
force a second ballot.

11:18.509 --> 11:20.043
- This is so corrupt.

11:20.044 --> 11:23.580
- Oh, I'm sorry if I've offended
your high moral standards.

11:23.581 --> 11:26.350
- Alright, so Dick, if I'm
getting what you're saying here,

11:26.351 --> 11:28.518
we still got a chance
to win this thing?

11:28.519 --> 11:29.388
- Correct.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.255
What do you say?

11:31.256 --> 11:32.355
- 'Bout what?

11:32.356 --> 11:34.625
- The girl as your surrogate.

11:34.626 --> 11:35.461
- What do you mean?

11:35.461 --> 11:36.293
For impotency stuff?

11:36.293 --> 11:37.227
I don't need any...

11:37.228 --> 11:40.031
- No, your political surrogate.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.032
- Oh.

11:41.866 --> 11:44.201
Well she is very appealing

11:44.202 --> 11:48.439
and people did seem to
respond to her singing, so...

11:48.440 --> 11:49.706
Yeah, sure, why not?

11:49.707 --> 11:51.776
Let's do it, that
thing you said.

11:51.777 --> 11:53.143
The suffragette.

11:53.144 --> 11:54.244
- Surrogate.

11:54.245 --> 11:55.283
- Right.

11:58.283 --> 11:59.284
- So,

12:00.284 --> 12:02.552
It doesn't matter whether
we like it or not.

12:02.553 --> 12:05.556
That's just the way God made us,

12:05.557 --> 12:07.224
full of the dickens

12:07.225 --> 12:08.625
and want things that
aren't good for us.

12:08.626 --> 12:09.726
Am I right about that?

12:10.828 --> 12:13.430
But, just because I see it,

12:13.431 --> 12:15.599
doesn't mean I gotta have it.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.234
And just because I like it,

12:17.235 --> 12:19.073
doesn't mean I gotta take it.

12:22.073 --> 12:24.008
Now, don't think it's
any easier for me

12:24.009 --> 12:26.009
because I'm a preacher,

12:26.010 --> 12:28.246
because I am a man of God.

12:29.246 --> 12:30.249
Shoot.

12:31.249 --> 12:32.984
I probably got more
sins than all of you!

12:35.586 --> 12:38.187
Now, I'm not trying
to shock you.

12:38.188 --> 12:41.593
I'm just telling you like it is.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.698
Because if you don't face
the truth, then what?

12:46.698 --> 12:48.832
You're shrouded in
a cloud of darkness.

12:48.833 --> 12:50.268
That's what the Bible says.

12:53.004 --> 12:54.009
Oh, the young people.

12:57.009 --> 12:59.176
They say, "Reverend Smith,

12:59.177 --> 13:01.045
"I like your preaching.

13:01.046 --> 13:02.814
"I like your sermons.

13:02.815 --> 13:05.849
"But why do you go
on and on about sin?

13:05.850 --> 13:08.786
"Why are you always
so judgemental?"

13:08.787 --> 13:13.757
And I say, "I'm not
judging anybody.

13:13.758 --> 13:16.192
"I'm just saying to them

13:16.193 --> 13:18.729
"they can get clean!"

13:18.730 --> 13:21.831
'Cause you see, God
is a great cleanser.

13:21.832 --> 13:25.168
He's like a spiritual washcloth.

13:25.169 --> 13:26.403
He can wipe away your sins,

13:26.404 --> 13:28.973
but you gotta put
in the elbow grease!

13:28.974 --> 13:31.008
I'm saying to you, church,

13:31.009 --> 13:34.045
you got to get down on

17:45.931 --> 17:46.898
- Uh huh.

17:48.066 --> 17:49.566
Friday is the last day

17:49.567 --> 17:51.934
to take your chance on
winning that family trip

17:51.935 --> 17:54.004
to the John The
Baptist Water Park,

17:54.005 --> 17:56.606
so make sure you see
Esther after the service

17:56.607 --> 17:58.107
to get your ticket.

17:58.108 --> 18:00.944
And we have a special
visitor again today,

18:00.945 --> 18:02.680
Senator Kenny Weston.

18:06.084 --> 18:08.518
Senator, did you want
to say a few words?

18:08.519 --> 18:09.354
- Oh.

18:09.355 --> 18:10.755
- No, thank you ma'am.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.355
He's just here to
worship humbly before God

18:12.356 --> 18:14.325
and he does every Sunday.

18:14.326 --> 18:15.858
- Alright, then.

18:15.859 --> 18:18.461
I know you're all gonna give
Senator Weston and his team

18:18.462 --> 18:21.597
a very warm welcome
when you see them.

18:21.598 --> 18:23.968
And don't forget, the
ladies' Bible study

18:23.969 --> 18:26.136
will not be meeting
this Wednesday

18:26.137 --> 18:29.774
owing to the problems with
the downstairs plumbing.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.776
And softball practice
will be held on Wednesday,

18:32.777 --> 18:36.450
7 p.m. at the high school,
field number three.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.052
- And then the
southern Baptist says,

18:41.053 --> 18:42.486
"God, you didn't hear me.

18:42.487 --> 18:45.456
"I said full of Grace,
not full of grease!"

18:47.291 --> 18:49.026
- Oh, that's a
good one, Reverend.

18:49.027 --> 18:51.461
- Daddy, that is so
old and so corny.

18:51.462 --> 18:52.962
- I know, but they're
laughing aren't they?

18:52.963 --> 18:54.364
- Oh, Reverend, I'd
like to introduce you

18:54.365 --> 18:55.731
to my campaign team.

18:55.732 --> 18:57.701
This is my Chief
Strategist, Dick Dinkler.

18:57.702 --> 18:59.202
- What a
pleasure to meet you, sir.

18:59.203 --> 19:00.636
- Very pleased to
meet you, Reverend.

19:00.637 --> 19:02.172
I thought you gave a
terrific sermon today.

19:02.173 --> 19:03.841
Really thought provoking.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.709
- Oh well, thank you.

19:05.710 --> 19:07.745
- And this is my
communications director,

19:07.746 --> 19:08.979
Miss Nicole Levine.

19:08.980 --> 19:09.913
- Well, good for you.

19:09.914 --> 19:11.347
A director at such a young age.

19:11.348 --> 19:13.249
You must be very
good at what you do.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.486
- Oh she is, outstanding.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.754
- Levine, huh?

19:16.755 --> 19:18.654
That means you're from
the tribe of Levi,

19:18.655 --> 19:21.357
the ministers of the
ancient temple of Israel.

19:21.358 --> 19:23.226
That means you and I
have a lot in common.

19:23.227 --> 19:24.996
In fact, I had the opportunity

19:24.997 --> 19:27.765
to visit the Holy
Land just last year.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.199
Have you been there?

19:29.200 --> 19:30.867
- I'm afraid I have not.

19:30.868 --> 19:33.871
- Well, you gotta get there
while you have the chance.

19:33.872 --> 19:36.105
Makes you appreciate we
Christians have to thank

19:36.106 --> 19:37.674
our Jewish brethern for.

19:37.675 --> 19:39.942
- Well, we did let you
borrow some of our books.

19:41.112 --> 19:42.712
- Oh, the Bible books.

19:42.713 --> 19:44.248
Oh, that's a good
one, Miss Levine.

19:44.249 --> 19:45.083
You gotta keep her.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.283
She's a smart cookie.

19:46.284 --> 19:47.517
- Oh yeah, we'll never
let go of Nicole.

19:47.518 --> 19:48.919
You know, she started with us

19:48.920 --> 19:50.688
when she was just a
sophomore at Brandeis.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.855
- Is that so?

19:51.856 --> 19:53.257
- Kenny, I have
something to show you.

19:53.258 --> 19:54.457
I don't think that,
I wanna know...

19:54.458 --> 19:56.058
- And who is this lovely lady?

19:56.059 --> 19:57.894
- Well, this is my
Campaign Manager,

19:57.895 --> 19:59.195
Yolanda Jones.

19:59.196 --> 20:01.131
- Who happens to be a
very devout Christian.

20:01.132 --> 20:03.366
- Oh, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Jones.

20:03.367 --> 20:06.971
- Ms., nice to meet
you too, Reverend.

20:07.971 --> 20:09.772
- Well, before you go,

20:09.773 --> 20:10.941
would you all like to join us

20:10.942 --> 20:12.741
for some coffee and fellowship?

20:12.742 --> 20:14.577
Liberty has made some cupcakes.

20:14.578 --> 20:16.113
- Of course we would.

20:16.114 --> 20:18.214
- But there is something we
would like to ask you first.

20:18.215 --> 20:19.584
- You and Liberty here.

20:19.585 --> 20:20.817
- Oh?

20:20.818 --> 20:22.052
- Well, we were
just so impressed

20:22.053 --> 20:23.286
by your daughter's
performance yesterday.

20:23.287 --> 20:24.488
Somehow she just really managed

20:24.489 --> 20:26.289
to capture the
spirit of America.

20:26.290 --> 20:27.758
- I thought so too.

20:27.759 --> 20:30.160
- So we were wondering if
she might consider joining us

20:30.161 --> 20:32.496
on the campaign
trail for a while?

20:32.497 --> 20:34.264
- You, you want me to sing?

20:34.265 --> 20:36.967
- Well yeah, sing, and be a...

20:36.968 --> 20:38.169
- We'd like you to be

20:38.170 --> 20:40.904
a featured spokesperson
for the campaign.

20:40.905 --> 20:41.839
- I don't know.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.472
Daddy, what do you think?

20:43.473 --> 20:45.843
- Well, Senator
Weston and his team

20:45.844 --> 20:48.010
seem like nice people.

20:48.011 --> 20:49.346
And you do say you're pro life?

20:49.347 --> 20:50.646
- Absolutely.

20:50.647 --> 20:52.316
I believe that life
begins at inception.

20:52.317 --> 20:53.151
- Conception.

20:53.152 --> 20:56.855
- Thing.

20:57.855 --> 20:59.855
- There's one thing
that concerns me

20:59.856 --> 21:02.124
is that the girl hasn't been
away from home very much

21:02.125 --> 21:04.127
and I have heard of the
activities that happen

21:04.128 --> 21:05.528
on the campaign trail,

21:05.529 --> 21:06.829
especially behind the scenes.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.097
- Daddy.

21:08.098 --> 21:09.266
I'm 24 years old.

21:09.267 --> 21:10.633
I went to college.

21:10.634 --> 21:12.169
- That's exactly why
we would be assigning

21:12.170 --> 21:15.104
Miss Levine to be Liberty's
personal chaperone,

21:15.105 --> 21:17.207
to make sure she's
absolutely safe.

21:17.208 --> 21:19.209
- Well, if that's the case,

21:19.210 --> 21:21.511
then it's a done deal.

21:21.512 --> 21:23.180
If that's okay with
you, Miss Liberty.

21:23.181 --> 21:24.147
- Well, I guess if you...

21:24.147 --> 21:25.115
- Terrific.

21:25.115 --> 21:26.017
Well, we all have to head back

21:26.018 --> 21:27.350
to Washington for a few days.

21:27.351 --> 21:28.719
- Yep, gotta make some votes.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.053
- But how about you
pack up your things

21:30.054 --> 21:32.556
and Levine, I mean, Nicole,

21:32.557 --> 21:34.958
picks you up right here,
day after tomorrow?

21:34.959 --> 21:35.794
- Okay.

21:37.694 --> 21:39.962
- Now, who wants some cupcakes?

21:39.963 --> 21:40.798
- Oh!

21:40.798 --> 21:41.633
- Let's go!

21:41.633 --> 21:42.467
- Okay.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.566
- I made a bunch.

21:43.567 --> 21:44.535
- A bunch?

21:44.535 --> 21:45.502
- Yeah.

21:45.502 --> 21:46.471
- Maybe I'll eat two.

21:59.483 --> 22:00.717
- We're thinking her colors

22:00.718 --> 22:01.918
would be the traditional
red, white, and blue,

22:01.919 --> 22:03.420
with a special emphasis on white

22:03.421 --> 22:04.654
to symbolize purity.

22:04.655 --> 22:05.490
- I like it.

22:05.491 --> 22:06.556
You got any pictures?

22:06.557 --> 22:08.158
- Here is the concept poster

22:08.159 --> 22:10.528
the focus groups responded to.

22:10.529 --> 22:14.163
We're thinking a silo,
maybe some grazing cattle.

22:14.164 --> 22:17.166
- How about you put
her on a wild mustang?

22:18.001 --> 22:18.001
- Nice.

22:18.904 --> 22:20.437
Yeah, catchy slogan, too.

22:20.438 --> 22:21.671
- Now are you
sure you want to quote

22:21.672 --> 22:23.074
a famous bisexual?

22:23.075 --> 22:24.341
- What?

22:24.342 --> 22:26.376
- Well, you know that's
Walt Whitman, don't you?

22:26.377 --> 22:28.511
- Whatever, these people
don't read poetry.

22:28.512 --> 22:29.779
- If they can read at all.

22:29.780 --> 22:31.181
- Nikki.

22:31.182 --> 22:32.383
- And on the bumper stickers,

22:32.384 --> 22:34.284
we're thinking just,
"I sing America."

22:34.285 --> 22:35.752
- Perfect.

22:35.753 --> 22:37.252
- Great, I'll get them
working on the first spot.

22:37.253 --> 22:39.625
Wait till you see the t-shirts.

22:40.625 --> 22:43.860
♪ Ooh yeah

22:43.861 --> 22:47.297
- I can't believe he
made me her babysitter.

22:47.298 --> 22:49.598
- She seems perfectly competent.

22:49.599 --> 22:51.134
I'm sure you don't
actually have to...

22:51.135 --> 22:52.903
- I should just quit now.

22:52.904 --> 22:55.038
- And let him take over?

22:55.039 --> 22:56.539
- Thanks.

22:56.540 --> 22:59.809
I'm not even sure that I want
to work in politics anymore.

22:59.810 --> 23:02.047
Oh, and her Daddy?

23:03.047 --> 23:04.449
- He's not so bad.

23:05.449 --> 23:07.717
- Whose side are you on, anyway?

23:07.718 --> 23:09.754
- Your side, baby girl, always.

23:09.755 --> 23:11.387
You know that.

23:11.388 --> 23:14.958
But sometimes you're a
little quick to judge people.

23:14.959 --> 23:16.492
- I'm judgmental?

23:16.493 --> 23:17.896
- Sometimes, yeah.

23:19.896 --> 23:23.267
Actually, it's kinda funny,
when you think about it.

23:23.268 --> 23:27.738
I mean, if he only
knew.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.107
- Nikki?

23:30.107 --> 23:31.607
- Hey.

23:31.608 --> 23:34.778
- We should so get together.

23:34.779 --> 23:36.579
I got a new hot tub.

23:36.580 --> 23:38.683
- I'm really busy.

23:39.683 --> 23:42.021
- Fine.

23:44.021 --> 23:45.756
- You could have
at least talked to her.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.658
- That girl is
not about talking.

23:56.300 --> 23:59.102
- Can you sit
on this for a second?

24:05.042 --> 24:08.444
- Are you sure
you need all these?

24:08.445 --> 24:09.645
- I need to be prepared.

24:09.646 --> 24:12.048
- I know, but can't you
just go to a library?

24:12.049 --> 24:14.452
- We're gonna be traveling.

24:15.452 --> 24:16.953
Sugar!

24:16.954 --> 24:17.788
- Hey, hey, hey.

24:17.788 --> 24:18.623
Don't rip it now.

24:18.623 --> 24:19.623
Let me try.

24:26.297 --> 24:30.633
Oh, "American Foreign
Policy since 1948."

24:30.634 --> 24:32.035
"Volume two."

24:32.036 --> 24:33.871
Sounds like a real page turner.

24:33.872 --> 24:36.172
- It's interesting.

24:36.173 --> 24:37.343
- Well...

24:38.343 --> 24:39.663
Well, how about
something smaller?

24:43.213 --> 24:44.717
Hmm?

24:45.717 --> 24:46.983
- The Little Mermaid?

24:46.984 --> 24:48.418
- Oh, you
used to love this.

24:48.419 --> 24:51.421
- Until I found
out they changed the ending.

24:51.422 --> 24:54.260
The original was so much better.

24:57.260 --> 24:59.765
Hand me that other one.

25:00.765 --> 25:01.832
- Hey listen, Lib.

25:01.833 --> 25:02.833
- Hm
- m?-

25:01.833 --> 25:02.467
Mm

25:02.468 --> 25:04.401
If, per,

25:04.402 --> 25:06.236
a young, eligible bachelor
on the campaign trail...

25:06.237 --> 25:07.504
- Daddy!

25:07.505 --> 25:08.372
- Well, you're not
getting any younger.

25:08.372 --> 25:09.372
- I'm not even 25!

25:11.041 --> 25:12.009
- Well, your mom
and I were married

25:12.010 --> 25:13.509
by the time we were 21.

25:13.510 --> 25:14.745
- You were precocious.

25:14.746 --> 25:17.448
- Well, I worry about you.

25:17.449 --> 25:20.383
You know, I'm not gonna
be around forever.

25:20.384 --> 25:21.884
- I don't need you
to take care of me.

25:21.885 --> 25:22.885
- I know.

25:24.355 --> 25:27.524
I just don't want
you to be lonely.

25:27.525 --> 25:28.525
- I'm not lonely.

25:28.526 --> 25:30.259
I have lots of friends.

25:30.260 --> 25:33.430
- Yeah, but not
a special friend.

25:33.431 --> 25:34.765
Not the kinda friend
that makes your heart

25:34.766 --> 25:37.933
go pitter pat like
your mom did for me.

25:37.934 --> 25:42.037
You never had a special
friend like that, have you?

25:42.038 --> 25:44.975
- Maybe I need to
get out of this town.

25:44.976 --> 25:49.614
You'd have to agree, my
options are somewhat limited.

25:50.614 --> 25:53.486
- Well, what about
them Sarver boys?

25:55.486 --> 25:56.752
I see them in
church every Sunday.

25:56.753 --> 25:58.587
They're good lookin'.

25:58.588 --> 26:00.790
- Carl and Greg Sarver?

26:00.791 --> 26:02.057
Are you kidding?

26:02.058 --> 26:04.326
All they care about
is four wheel drives,

26:04.327 --> 26:06.365
fly fishing, and beer.

26:07.365 --> 26:09.732
- Oh geez, well
I guess you're
right.

26:09.733 --> 26:12.635
- Daddy, I know you just
want me to be happy,

26:12.636 --> 26:15.238
but I'm not gonna
be happy if I marry

26:15.239 --> 26:16.839
someone I'm not in love with.

26:16.840 --> 26:19.476
- That's true, but
don't you think that

26:19.477 --> 26:22.345
your expectations are just
a little bit unrealistic?

26:22.346 --> 26:24.847
I mean look, let's face it.

26:24.848 --> 26:27.851
No guy is gonna be
as smart as you.

26:27.852 --> 26:29.853
And brains ain't everything.

of political strategy

33:49.192 --> 33:51.528

Weston tonight.

And could one young woman

I'm Rolf Schnitzel and
you've just entered

33:57.768 --> 33:59.435
The Briefing Room.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.209
Well, some political
analysts are calling it

34:06.210 --> 34:08.645
a desperate Hail Mary pass,

34:08.646 --> 34:10.612
while others applaud
Kenny Weston's

34:10.614 --> 34:12.313
recent political rebranding

34:12.315 --> 34:14.551
as a brilliant

definitely gotta improve

39:39.775 --> 39:42.044
his performance in
the next debate.

39:42.045 --> 39:44.145
He needs to look presidential;

Weston campaign surrogate,
Miss Liberty Smith.

47:18.867 --> 47:20.669
Welcome to The
Briefing Room, Liberty.

47:20.670 --> 47:21.937
- Thanks, Rolf.

47:21.938 --> 47:24.171
I'm really delighted to be here.

47:24.172 --> 47:26.841
- Now, Liberty, let's be honest.

47:26.842 --> 47:28.944
Without you, Kenny
Weston's campaign

47:28.945 --> 47:30.879
would have been washed
up a few months ago.

47:30.880 --> 47:33.616
You gave him whole
a new lease on life.

47:33.617 --> 47:36.384
- That's very
nice of you to say, Rolf,

47:36.385 --> 47:39.221
but I really can't
claim any credit.

47:39.222 --> 47:41.455
Senator Weston is the
one who's out there

47:41.456 --> 47:45.026
every day fighting for
ordinary Americans.

47:45.027 --> 47:47.194
I'm just cheering
from the sidelines.

47:47.195 --> 47:48.930
- Well, I guess every
candidate wishes he had

47:48.931 --> 47:51.033
a cheerleader as
pretty as you, then.

47:53.103 --> 47:55.069
Now, of course, we
all know your father

47:55.070 --> 47:57.071
is a well-respected pastor.

47:57.072 --> 47:58.205
- Mmhmm, that's right.

47:58.206 --> 47:59.741
- But what our
viewers might not know

47:59.742 --> 48:02.544
is that your mother was
a medical missionary

48:02.545 --> 48:04.479
who traveled to some of
the most dangerous parts

48:04.480 --> 48:08.149
of the world in order to
help those in need, until...

48:08.150 --> 48:09.451
- That's right.

48:09.452 --> 48:10.721
My mother was...

48:11.721 --> 48:13.388
- She was tragically...

48:13.389 --> 48:16.092
- Yes, as a matter of fact,

48:17.092 --> 48:21.462
that's why I am such a strong
support of Senator Weston.

48:21.463 --> 48:24.066
Senator Weston believes that
America should take the lead

48:24.067 --> 48:28.840
in ... creating
a more peaceful world.

48:29.840 --> 48:30.773
- Fascinating.

48:30.773 --> 48:31.740
We're gonna take a short break,

48:31.741 --> 48:32.741
but when we come back,

48:32.742 --> 48:34.276
more intimate conversation

48:34.277 --> 48:37.312
with America's political
sweetheart, Miss Liberty Smith.

48:37.313 --> 48:38.513
Stick around.

48:45.086 --> 48:46.522
- You really think it was okay?

48:46.523 --> 48:47.756
- Yeah, it was great.

48:47.757 --> 48:49.357
It was perfect.

48:49.358 --> 48:51.292
And nice pivot on
that Mom question.

48:51.293 --> 48:52.861
I'm glad you didn't
let him push you around

48:52.862 --> 48:54.096
and get too personal.

48:54.097 --> 48:55.665
- Hey girls!

48:55.666 --> 48:57.131
- Hi Yolanda!

48:57.132 --> 48:59.267
- I saw you from the green room.

48:59.268 --> 49:01.904
You were fabulous.

49:01.905 --> 49:03.837
- Well, that's only
because of Nikki.

49:03.838 --> 49:05.140
You wanna come to lunch with us?

49:05.141 --> 49:07.942
- I wish I could,
but I got a plane.

49:07.943 --> 49:10.444
Dickler wants you back
in Washington, too.

49:10.445 --> 49:11.680
- What?

49:11.681 --> 49:13.814
- Kenny needs debate
prep, badly.

49:13.815 --> 49:15.451
Probably now until the election.

49:15.452 --> 49:18.153
- But I thought she was gonna
be with me the whole time.

49:18.154 --> 49:19.154
- Don't worry about it.

49:19.155 --> 49:20.355
You're doing great.

49:20.356 --> 49:22.457
You don't need me anymore.

49:22.458 --> 49:23.491
- That's not true.

49:23.492 --> 49:25.727
I still need you.

49:25.728 --> 49:26.995
I mean, your help.

49:26.996 --> 49:30.698
I'm still not very
good at all this.

49:30.699 --> 49:34.669
- Hey, hey, why don't you
come with us for a few days?

49:34.670 --> 49:35.837
- What?

49:35.838 --> 49:36.739
- Where?

49:36.740 --> 49:37.805
- To Washington.

49:37.806 --> 49:38.973
You could stay with me.

49:38.974 --> 49:41.241
I have a whole empty house now.

49:41.242 --> 49:42.977
- I wouldn't wanna impose, or...

49:42.978 --> 49:44.479
- Not at all.

49:44.480 --> 49:46.314
I'll give you your own key.

49:46.315 --> 49:48.082
You can come and go

49:48.083 --> 49:49.651
and Nikki can show you

49:49.652 --> 49:52.254
around town between
sessions, right Nik?

49:52.255 --> 49:53.088
- Mmhmm.

49:53.088 --> 49:54.088
- Nikki?

49:55.157 --> 49:57.993
I'd love to, but are
you sure it's okay?

49:57.994 --> 50:00.062
- Positive.

50:00.063 --> 50:01.063
- Okay.

50:12.708 --> 50:14.410
- Alright, Kenny, just
relax, be yourself,

50:14.411 --> 50:15.576
and the election is yours,

50:15.577 --> 50:17.412
as long as you don't fuck up.

50:17.413 --> 50:18.879
- I'm sure that really
puts him at ease.

50:18.880 --> 50:20.614
- Stay in character, Levine.

50:20.615 --> 50:22.917
Alright, Kenny, let's try one.

50:22.918 --> 50:23.753
Put on the glasses.

50:23.754 --> 50:25.687
- Oh, the glasses, yeah.

50:25.688 --> 50:27.522
Alright, okay, hit me.

50:27.523 --> 50:28.356
I'm ready.

50:28.357 --> 50:30.125
- Senator Weston.

50:30.126 --> 50:32.593
Could you please outline
your position on immigration?

50:32.594 --> 50:34.529
Specifically, do you
favor comprehensive

50:34.530 --> 50:37.732
immigration reform and
a path to citizenship?

50:37.733 --> 50:38.933
- Immigration, okay.

50:38.934 --> 50:41.371
Uh, that's a tough one, uh...

50:42.371 --> 50:43.404
Right, well Nikki...

50:43.405 --> 50:44.240
- Rolf.

50:44.241 --> 50:45.876
- Rolf, Rolf, right.

50:46.876 --> 50:49.210
Well, Rolf, as you know,

50:49.211 --> 50:51.046
America is a nation
of immigrants.

50:51.047 --> 50:54.984
My ancestors, my wife's
grandparents, all came here,

50:54.985 --> 50:56.584
legally, of course,

50:56.585 --> 50:59.053
trying to make a better
life for themselves

50:59.054 --> 51:00.756
and for their children.

51:00.757 --> 51:03.725
They left from wherever
they were and came

51:03.726 --> 51:06.627
to the Statue of
Liberty, where our poor

51:06.628 --> 51:08.930
and our hungry, our
wretched refuse,

51:08.931 --> 51:11.402
our tired, all huddled together.

51:13.402 --> 51:14.636
Now, Julie's family worked

51:14.637 --> 51:16.805
in the coal mines
in Pennsylvania

51:16.806 --> 51:18.406
and mine worked hard

51:18.407 --> 51:20.308
on river boats up and
down the Mississippi,

51:20.309 --> 51:23.410
like you might see in
Mark Twain or Huck Finn...

51:23.411 --> 51:25.247
- What the _____ are
you talking about?

51:25.248 --> 51:26.749
- Well, okay, you're
making me nervous.

51:26.750 --> 51:27.982
Just let me...

51:27.983 --> 51:28.918
Here, give me another one.

51:28.918 --> 51:29.753
Let's start over again, okay?

51:31.621 --> 51:33.087
- Foreign policy.

51:33.088 --> 51:34.455
- Senator Weston,

51:34.456 --> 51:36.290
some in your party
say that it's time

51:36.291 --> 51:37.759
for America to scale back

51:37.760 --> 51:40.328
its military commitments
around the world.

51:40.329 --> 51:42.997
They say we simply can no
longer be the world's policeman

51:42.998 --> 51:46.033
and they propose major
cuts to the defense budget.

51:46.034 --> 51:49.937
Where exactly do you
stand on this issue?

51:49.938 --> 51:51.607
- Well, I appreciate
your question, Nikki.

51:51.608 --> 51:54.375
- Rolf!
- Shit, Rolf!

51:54.376 --> 51:55.376
Rolf,

51:56.344 --> 51:57.547
as you know,

51:58.547 --> 52:01.049
America is the greatest
country in the world.

52:01.050 --> 52:02.850
In fact, we always have been,

52:02.851 --> 52:04.486
ever since we beat the Redcoats

52:04.487 --> 52:05.819
in the American Revolution,

52:05.820 --> 52:08.989
and I guess I'm just not
ready to give that up.

52:08.990 --> 52:10.392
You know, American workers are

52:10.393 --> 52:12.627
the greatest
workers in the world

52:12.628 --> 52:15.230
and that's why everyone
wants military hardware

52:15.231 --> 52:18.067
that's from the
United States, so,

52:18.068 --> 52:20.035
if I am elected president,

52:20.036 --> 52:23.305
I'll guarantee that
every aircraft carrier,

52:23.306 --> 52:26.475
every cruise missile,
every jet fighter,

52:26.476 --> 52:29.143
every surveillance
drone across the world,

52:29.144 --> 52:32.881
around the entire globe says,

52:32.882 --> 52:34.384
Made in America,

52:35.384 --> 52:38.190
not, Made in Japan or Guatemala.

52:42.190 --> 52:44.493
- Kenny, did you memorize the
talking points I gave you?

52:44.494 --> 52:45.529
- Yes.

52:46.529 --> 52:47.763
Which ones?

52:47.764 --> 52:48.597
- All of them.

52:48.598 --> 52:49.830
- Most of 'em.

52:49.831 --> 52:51.232
- You have to
memorize all of them

52:51.233 --> 52:52.567
and all of the
attack lines, too.

52:52.568 --> 52:54.102
Absolutely no ad-libbing.

52:54.103 --> 52:55.337
Just the script.

52:55.338 --> 52:57.839
We can't rehearse until
you know your lines.

52:57.840 --> 53:02.511
- Well, I thought that last
answer was pretty good.

53:02.512 --> 53:03.710
- Alright, we're
done for the day.

53:03.711 --> 53:06.351
Kenny, I need to talk to you.

53:08.351 --> 53:09.517
- Hey.

53:09.518 --> 53:10.554
Where are you?

53:11.554 --> 53:12.855
Okay.

53:31.273 --> 53:35.944
- "With malice toward
none, with charity for all,

53:35.945 --> 53:37.212
"with firmness in the right,

53:37.213 --> 53:39.881
"as God gives us
to see the right,

53:39.882 --> 53:44.053
"let us strive on to finish
the work we are in and that..."

53:48.090 --> 53:49.625
- Hey, what's up?

53:49.626 --> 53:50.792
- Where are you?

53:50.793 --> 53:53.328
- Oh, we're just leaving
the Lincoln... shit.

53:53.329 --> 53:55.364
Shoot, totally forgot.

53:56.364 --> 53:57.899
- I figured you did.

53:57.900 --> 53:59.567
Why don't you just head over now

53:59.568 --> 54:00.901
and bring Libby with you?

54:00.902 --> 54:02.671
We'll make it a trio.

54:02.672 --> 54:04.171
- Bring her there?

54:04.172 --> 54:05.573
- Bring me where?

54:05.574 --> 54:07.642
- Bring
her to the bar.

54:07.643 --> 54:10.078
- Yolanda invited me for
drinks for my birthday.

54:10.079 --> 54:11.580
Do you want to come?

54:12.782 --> 54:14.318
We'll be there in 15.

54:34.536 --> 54:37.339
- Surprise!

54:37.340 --> 54:38.173
- What?

54:38.174 --> 54:40.107
You sneaky bitch.

54:40.108 --> 54:42.643
- I thought you'd never
get here.

54:42.644 --> 54:45.113
- Did you know about this?

54:46.449 --> 54:49.121
Remind me to never
trust you again.

54:51.121 --> 54:52.956
- Hey, how are you?

54:53.956 --> 54:54.789
Let me take your coat.

54:54.790 --> 54:56.290
- Okay.

55:05.300 --> 55:07.301
- What
can I get you guys?

55:07.302 --> 55:09.538
- Um, do you have,
like, ginger ale?

55:09.539 --> 55:10.805
- Yeah, sure.

55:10.806 --> 55:11.639
- That sounds good,
I'll have the same.

55:11.640 --> 55:13.815
- Okay.

55:19.815 --> 55:20.815
- So...

55:23.719 --> 55:24.719
How are you?

55:26.155 --> 55:27.522
- Fine.

55:27.523 --> 55:28.857
Fine, yeah.

55:28.858 --> 55:30.827
Thanks, just fine.

55:32.827 --> 55:35.263
Oh, I almost forgot, uh...

55:35.264 --> 55:36.899
I have a present for you.

55:36.900 --> 55:38.098
- Oh, you
didn't have to do that.

55:38.099 --> 55:40.535
- Well, I was in the
Supreme Court gift shop

55:40.536 --> 55:41.536
and I saw this.

55:43.338 --> 55:45.941
I thought of you right away.

55:45.942 --> 55:48.042
- The Complete Opinions
of Louis Brandeis.

55:48.043 --> 55:49.044
- Yeah.

55:49.045 --> 55:50.511
I hope you don't
have it already.

55:50.512 --> 55:52.247
- No, I don't have it.

55:52.248 --> 55:54.015
- The dissent on
Olmstead versus U.S.

55:54.016 --> 55:55.552
is really incredible.

55:56.552 --> 56:00.189
Anyway, I just thought,
if you do end up going
to law school,

56:00.190 --> 56:02.961
you know, it might
come in handy.

56:06.961 --> 56:09.934
- I don't know anyone like you.

56:11.934 --> 56:13.600
To you.

56:13.601 --> 56:15.739
- Well, no, to us.

56:16.739 --> 56:19.374
I mean, you know, to both of us.

56:19.375 --> 56:20.916
Not just me.

56:27.916 --> 56:30.352
Oh shoot!

56:30.353 --> 56:31.253
Oh my gosh.

56:31.254 --> 56:32.486
- You're all wet.

56:32.487 --> 56:35.924
- Oh, uh... I
can do that by myself.

56:35.925 --> 56:37.725
Thanks, um...

56:37.726 --> 56:39.493
Listen, I better...

56:39.494 --> 56:40.560
- I should drive you...

56:40.561 --> 56:41.331
- No!
- It's late.

56:41.331 --> 56:42.331
- I mean, I'm fine.

56:44.132 --> 56:46.768
I should really, I gotta
catch my plane early tomorrow.

56:46.769 --> 56:48.236
I should, uh...

56:48.237 --> 56:51.244
Thanks for a great gay... day!

01:01:44.199 --> 01:01:46.401
A campaign scandal that
has rocked Washington

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:48.970
and put this election
back up for grabs.

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:53.908
America's conservative
sweetheart turns out to be

01:01:53.909 --> 01:01:54.909
a lesbian.

01:01:56.378 --> 01:01:58.279
Now, Democrats are
calling flip-flop,

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.948
and Weston's socially
conservative base is furious.

01:02:01.949 --> 01:02:03.451
The big question now, of course,

01:02:03.452 --> 01:02:05.053
what did Kenny Weston know

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:07.622
about Liberty's
sexual preference,

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:09.457
and when did he know it?

01:02:31.179 --> 01:02:34.420
- I'm really sorry,
Kenny, I messed up.

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:39.255
- Well, maybe we...

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:40.754
- You messed up?

01:02:40.755 --> 01:02:42.323
You fucked over
our whole campaign

01:02:42.324 --> 01:02:43.924
just so you could score
a little more pussy.

01:02:43.925 --> 01:02:45.459
- You shut your dirty mouth!

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:46.627
You can't talk to her like that!

01:02:46.628 --> 01:02:47.463
- Says who?

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:48.463
- Says me!

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:55.139
- Well, at the very least, it
was incredibly unprofessional.

01:02:58.139 --> 01:03:01.674
- I just wanted to
say how sorry I am

01:03:01.675 --> 01:03:04.946
for all the trouble I've caused.

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:06.887
I'm going away.

01:03:11.887 --> 01:03:13.288
- Liberty, it's okay.

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:14.955
Just because your father's
a bigot, doesn't...

01:03:14.956 --> 01:03:16.457
- He's not a bigot!

01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:17.692
- That's not what I
meant to say...

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:20.528
- He's the kindest, most
generous person I know.

01:03:20.529 --> 01:03:23.565
If anybody's a bigot, it's you.

01:03:24.565 --> 01:03:25.799
- What?

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:26.968
- You think anybody
who believes in God

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:29.638
is stupid, or naive, or
deluded or...

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:30.639
- I never said that.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.040
- You didn't have to!

01:03:33.041 --> 01:03:34.542
- Why are you taking
this out on me?

01:03:34.543 --> 01:03:36.646
I'm not the one...

01:03:38.646 --> 01:03:39.481
I love you.

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:40.650
- Oh please.

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:45.486
You don't even know
what real love is.

01:03:45.487 --> 01:03:47.988
It's about self sacrifice.

01:03:47.989 --> 01:03:51.658
It's about doing
things for others.

01:03:51.659 --> 01:03:56.230
Doing the right thing, even if
it's not the thing you want.

01:03:56.231 --> 01:03:59.702
Giving up your own life
for someone else's.

01:04:00.702 --> 01:04:02.338
That's real love.

01:04:04.338 --> 01:04:05.607
- No.

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:07.341
That's codependency.

01:04:07.342 --> 01:04:09.579
There's a big difference.

01:04:10.579 --> 01:04:13.881
- So you're saying
Jesus was codependent?

01:04:13.882 --> 01:04:15.116
I knew it.

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:16.923
- Liberty, wait a sec.

01:04:21.923 --> 01:04:26.593
- Oh Lord, we ask you for
the courage to change,

01:04:26.594 --> 01:04:29.029
for we know if we come
before you humbly,

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:33.701
and ask for forgiveness,
we will be born anew.

01:04:33.702 --> 01:04:37.104

Oh Lord, we ask you to fill her
afresh with the Holy Spirit,

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.922
and to make her clean again.

01:04:54.923 --> 01:04:56.491
Thank you, Lord.

01:04:56.492 --> 01:04:58.829
In Jesus name we pray, Amen.

01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:01.829
- Amen.

01:05:02.664 --> 01:05:05.732
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.

01:05:05.733 --> 01:05:08.937
- I think praying
made me feel even worse.

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:11.671
- But you're gonna be all
better real soon.

01:05:11.672 --> 01:05:12.906
The brochure says this place

making me feel worse.

You're definitely
not a happy drunk.

01:05:37.798 --> 01:05:39.700
- I shouldn't have kissed her.

01:05:39.701 --> 01:05:41.268
- It's not like
she didn't want to.

01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:44.608
- No, maybe I just
pushed her into it.

01:05:46.608 --> 01:05:49.343
- I really think
she'll come around.

01:05:49.344 --> 01:05:50.547

01:15:56.951 --> 01:15:58.551
- Can I talk to
you for a moment?

01:15:58.552 --> 01:16:00.720
- Well sure, come on in.

01:16:00.721 --> 01:16:02.989
I'm sorry, the place
usually isn't this bad.

01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.990
Have a seat.

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:09.295
Can I get you
something to drink?

01:16:09.296 --> 01:16:11.398
Coffee or pop or juice?

01:16:11.399 --> 01:16:12.569
- No, thanks.

01:16:14.569 --> 01:16:16.636
- Well, you must
be as overwhelmed

01:16:16.637 --> 01:16:18.438
by this whole thing as I am.

01:16:18.439 --> 01:16:21.140
- Actually, I'm not
with the campaign anymore.

01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:22.109
- Oh.

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:23.343
- Reverend Smith.

01:16:23.344 --> 01:16:27.080
- It's J.J.

01:16:27.081 --> 01:16:30.017
- I know you only want what
you think is best for Liberty.

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:34.755
- Hey, it's not what I
want, it's what God wants.

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:38.658
- Don't you think God
wants Liberty to be happy?

01:16:38.659 --> 01:16:41.528
- Uh, yeah, but sin can't
make a person happy,

01:16:41.529 --> 01:16:43.130
not in the long run.

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:46.269
- And loving someone,
is that a sin?

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.807
- Oh, well...

01:16:52.807 --> 01:16:55.675
- I don't know if
Libby ever told you,

01:16:55.676 --> 01:16:59.246
but my father was a pastor.

01:16:59.247 --> 01:17:00.813
- I don't recall
that she did.

01:17:00.814 --> 01:17:03.149
- I grew up in the church.

01:17:03.150 --> 01:17:06.886
There were five of us, and
my oldest brother Jimmy,

01:17:06.887 --> 01:17:10.657
he was an incredible
singer as a young man.

01:17:10.658 --> 01:17:13.059
Everybody said he had
the most beautiful voice

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.797
they'd ever heard.

01:17:16.797 --> 01:17:19.301
Until one day, my dad

01:17:20.301 --> 01:17:23.804
found him with another
boy from the choir.

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:25.238
Were they...

01:17:25.239 --> 01:17:28.010
- Daddy was furious.

01:17:29.010 --> 01:17:34.083
Said, no son of his was
gonna be a "candy ass faggot."

01:17:36.083 --> 01:17:37.319
Jimmy was so ashamed.

01:17:39.319 --> 01:17:42.154
We didn't see him for years.

01:17:42.155 --> 01:17:44.890
Didn't know if he
was dead or alive.

01:17:44.891 --> 01:17:47.094
- Well, what happened to him?

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:49.698
- He ran away to the city.

01:17:50.698 --> 01:17:54.667
Lord knows what he had to
do to survive in those days.

01:17:54.668 --> 01:17:56.072
He was 16.

01:17:58.072 --> 01:18:00.109
- Did you ever see him again?

01:18:02.109 --> 01:18:05.015
- I did, couple
times before he died.

01:18:08.015 --> 01:18:10.087
He didn't look the same though.

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:13.456
And the saddest thing...

01:18:15.456 --> 01:18:16.525
- What?

01:18:18.525 --> 01:18:21.363
- He never sang another note,

01:18:22.363 --> 01:18:25.201
not one note.

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:30.036
Anointed by God with
a beautiful voice,

01:18:30.037 --> 01:18:32.309
and he never used it again.

01:18:34.309 --> 01:18:37.376
I guess he felt like
he didn't have much

01:18:37.377 --> 01:18:39.550
to sing praise about.

- And five,
four, three, two...

01:26:14.534 --> 01:26:15.902
- Senator Weston,
thank you so much

01:26:15.903 --> 01:26:17.836
for joining us here on
The Briefing Room today.

01:26:17.837 --> 01:26:19.205
- Well, it's my pleasure, Rolf.

01:26:19.206 --> 01:26:20.605
- Let's get right to it.

01:26:20.606 --> 01:26:22.875
The latest polls show
that the general public,

01:26:22.876 --> 01:26:24.943
and even a majority
within your own party,

01:26:24.944 --> 01:26:27.013
have an overwhelmingly
favorable opinion

01:26:27.014 --> 01:26:28.581
of the Liberty-Levine
relationship

01:26:28.582 --> 01:26:31.283
since their appearance on
the Sunday talks last week.

01:26:31.284 --> 01:26:32.452
In fact, many observers

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:34.187
attribute your
sagging poll numbers

01:26:34.188 --> 01:26:36.622
to your poor handling
of the Kissgate scandal.

01:26:36.623 --> 01:26:39.059
Would you consider
revising your position

01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:40.359
on their relationship

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.029
and on same-sex
marriage, generally?

01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:46.566
- Well, Rolf, as
I have stated before,

01:26:46.567 --> 01:26:48.434
I bear no personal animosity

01:26:48.435 --> 01:26:50.569
toward Liberty or Miss Levine

01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:54.243
or the homosexual people,
as a people, generally.

01:26:56.243 --> 01:27:00.546
In fact, I wish them all
the happiness in the world.

01:27:00.547 --> 01:27:04.618
I believe that America
is all about freedom.

01:27:05.618 --> 01:27:08.888
That's why my ancestors came
here in the first place.

01:27:08.889 --> 01:27:11.224
Well, they weren't
gay, of course.

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:13.893
You know, if they were gay,
I wouldn't even be here.

01:27:13.894 --> 01:27:15.161
But, uh, you know,
I don't even know

01:27:15.162 --> 01:27:17.797
if they had gay
people back then,

01:27:17.798 --> 01:27:19.068

support same sex marriage?

01:27:27.574 --> 01:27:29.843
- I didn't say that.
