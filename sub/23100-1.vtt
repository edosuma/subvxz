-No, that noise.
-It's coming from that direction.

01:44.625 --> 01:45.625
Wow!

01:49.458 --> 01:53.750
-What is it?
-It's a work of art.

I invented it. It's a crick-ta-pult.

all my projections suggest that--

13:10.208 --> 13:11.875

13:11.958 --> 13:14.375

13:14.541 --> 13:18.416
about a crazy relative of mine,
my weird Uncle Wilbur.

13:18.500 --> 13:22.708
And I'm telling you, no little old
blue light never scared me none.

13:22.791 --> 13:27.416
Bad blue is more than just a light, buddy.
It's your worst nightmare.

13:27.500 --> 13:31.458

made up to scare little bugs.

13:32.916 --> 13:33.791

If you're so brave, why don't you fly up
to bad blue right now?

13:39.750 --> 13:42.041
Go on. I dare you.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.250
Uncle Wilbur was terrified,

13:44.333 --> 13:47.000
but he never, ever turned down a dare.

13:48.666 --> 13:50.833
Okay, Roachie boy, you're on.

13:50.916 --> 13:53.583
Hey, pal, I was only kidding.
Just-- Hey! Stop!

13:53.666 --> 13:56.875
Nobody really knows for sure
what happened next.

14:04.291 --> 14:06.791
Oh, well. Guess he won't be needing this.

14:07.708 --> 14:12.166
And weird Uncle Wilbur
was never seen again.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.375
Not ever.

14:14.458 --> 14:16.750
So, what's the happy ending?

14:16.833 --> 14:18.791
Um... Well, there...

14:18.875 --> 14:20.708
There isn't one. Sorry, Buzz.

14:22.125 --> 14:24.750
Okay. That's bug time.

14:24.833 --> 14:26.500
Sweet dreams, everyone.

14:29.458 --> 14:32.125

14:35.666 --> 14:39.583

14:44.583 --> 14:46.208

14:46.291 --> 14:47.833

14:48.291 --> 14:51.083
I'm not scared. I'm not.

14:56.291 --> 14:57.333
I know, I just...

14:57.416 --> 15:03.625
I just can't sleep 'cause bad blue,
he's all sparky in here.

15:03.708 --> 15:08.541
Uh, I hate to be the slug
who says I told you so, but I did say--

15:08.625 --> 15:10.416
Sorry about my story, Buzz.

15:10.500 --> 15:14.000
Uh, hello? I was just saying,
this is exactly what I predicted.

15:14.083 --> 15:17.291
The important thing is,
we have to find a way to help Buzz sleep.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.833
Any ideas?

15:20.458 --> 15:25.375
Actually, I think
I have the perfect invention.

15:26.166 --> 15:29.208
I call this the crickto-pat-omatic.

15:29.291 --> 15:33.041
And I calculate, uh,
it will pat a bug to sleep

15:33.125 --> 15:37.666
in, uh, 17.26 seconds, approximately.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.875
That's nice.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.000
Ouchie!

15:51.083 --> 15:54.291
-It may need some, uh, fine-tuning.
-Ouchie!

15:54.375 --> 15:58.291
Ah! I'd better, ooh, take it
back to, ooh, to my workshop.

15:59.875 --> 16:03.500
Actually, Buzz, I have
a sleep-making machine of my own.

16:04.500 --> 16:09.625
Welcome to the softest, most jelly
belly-est bed you'll ever sleep on.

16:09.708 --> 16:11.541
Climb aboard, Buzz.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.250
It's like-- It's like swimming.

16:18.750 --> 16:21.166
It's so much fun.

16:21.250 --> 16:22.916
That tickles.

16:28.916 --> 16:30.750
Buzz, are you okay?

16:30.833 --> 16:35.541
I feel a bit... seasick.

16:38.041 --> 16:42.291
Huh. Sometimes the squish is just
too squishy for the squeamish.

16:42.375 --> 16:45.083
Jay, why don't you play Buzz
a nice lullaby?

16:45.166 --> 16:46.666
What's a lubba-ly?

16:46.750 --> 16:49.958
Oh, it's a nice peaceful song
to soothe you to sleep.

16:50.041 --> 16:51.958
One lullaby coming right up.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.791
A one, two, three, four!

17:17.875 --> 17:20.208
Bad blue, bad blue!

17:20.290 --> 17:22.958
It's all right, Buzz. You're safe with us.

17:27.958 --> 17:31.125
She's still in a bad way.
We have to do something.

17:32.125 --> 17:33.916
And I think I know what.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.791
We have to take her
to see Lucy, the sleep doctor.

17:36.875 --> 17:39.708
You mean Lucy
with the kaleidoscope eyes?

17:39.791 --> 17:44.458
-Lucy the dragonfly?
-But-- But she's not a real doctor.

17:44.541 --> 17:47.541
-Everyone says she's amazing, Crick.
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

17:47.625 --> 17:51.458

Oh, wait, wait, wait. Just wait.
I'd better draw a map.

18:00.458 --> 18:03.791
And isn't there a fountain?
With amazing flowers?

18:03.875 --> 18:07.083
