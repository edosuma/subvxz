01:56.322 --> 01:57.322
Hey, Pop.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.996
Been a while, hasn't it?

02:02.079 --> 02:04.290
Did you see that motorcade roll up?

02:04.373 --> 02:09.612
It's the first time that
the President of the United States

02:09.638 --> 02:11.807
has visited Gaffney.

02:11.890 --> 02:13.975
Can you believe it?

02:14.977 --> 02:16.937
Oh, I wouldn't be here
if I had a choice.

02:17.021 --> 02:18.856
But I have to do these
sort of things now.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.482
Makes me seem more human.

02:20.566 --> 02:23.778
And you have to be a little human
when you're the president.

02:23.861 --> 02:26.364
He couldn't even afford
to pay for his own gravestone.

02:26.447 --> 02:30.910
I paid for it out of my own
scholarship money from The Sentinel.

02:30.993 --> 02:33.913
Nobody showed up
for his funeral except me.

02:33.996 --> 02:35.998
Not even my mother.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.212
But I'll tell you this, though, Pop:

02:42.296 --> 02:46.175
when they bury me,
it won't be in my backyard.

02:46.258 --> 02:49.511
And when they come
to pay their respects,

02:49.595 --> 02:52.014
they'll have to wait in line.

02:57.519 --> 02:59.646
You should let us
take a photo at the grave.

02:59.730 --> 03:03.650
He wants privacy. The man's
honoring his father, for God's sakes.

03:17.168 --> 04:53.905

04:55.387 --> 04:58.015
Here's the info
you were looking for.

04:58.098 --> 05:03.770
And we have that scheduled
for next Tuesday at 10 a.m.

05:03.854 --> 05:06.565
That's still good for you, right?

05:06.648 --> 05:09.067
Excellent. I'll confirm it.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.239
Excuse me.

05:14.323 --> 05:15.616
Yes, sir?

05:15.699 --> 05:17.201
Yes, sir.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.286
The president is ready to see you now.

05:23.415 --> 05:24.416
Jesus.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.170
I'm devastated.

05:30.005 --> 05:31.924
I love this man as if he were my son.

05:33.759 --> 05:37.846
Now, he's a fighter,
and I'm sure that he'll pull through.

05:37.930 --> 05:39.765
Our prayers are with him.

05:39.848 --> 05:43.727
"...said President Underwood
during a press conference yesterday.

05:44.728 --> 05:48.815
The Maryland State Police and
Federal authorities have yet to locate

05:48.899 --> 05:52.110
Mr. Stamper's car or name any suspects."

05:54.613 --> 05:56.782
You want more of this, brother?

05:59.368 --> 06:01.370
Or maybe the sports page?

06:07.292 --> 06:12.881
"Game Six of the World Series
went scoreless for 13 innings

06:12.965 --> 06:16.802
before a rain delay that turned
an already epic evening

06:16.885 --> 06:19.096
into one for the history books."

06:57.384 --> 06:59.219
We need a doctor
in room three-one.

06:59.302 --> 07:00.804
Douglas?

07:01.680 --> 07:03.640
Can you hear me?

07:04.558 --> 07:07.144
I want you to blink if you can hear me.

07:12.274 --> 07:13.859
Again.

07:18.613 --> 07:20.782
My name is Dr. Lanjwani.

07:20.866 --> 07:23.577
The president's office asked me
to look after you personally.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.204
You're getting the very best
of care, okay?

07:27.914 --> 07:31.126
Douglas, I want you to blink
if you can feel this.

07:35.505 --> 07:37.841
Good. Good.

07:37.924 --> 07:39.676
How about this?

07:41.553 --> 07:42.888
Okay. Excellent.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.182
And this?

07:49.227 --> 07:51.438
How about here?

07:55.817 --> 07:57.235
Relax.

07:57.319 --> 08:00.739
Relax.
Perfectly normal at this early stage.

08:00.822 --> 08:02.074
Relax.

08:02.157 --> 08:03.992
That's good.

08:04.076 --> 08:06.411
Okay. Get some rest.

08:32.687 --> 08:34.356
Are you gonna hurt me?

08:35.065 --> 08:37.984
I will do whatever you want,
please just don't hurt me.

08:38.068 --> 08:40.320
- Does that hurt?
- A little.

08:40.404 --> 08:43.115
All right, let's go ahead.
Try and make a fist for me.

08:43.198 --> 08:44.866
- Remy.
- What's that?

08:44.950 --> 08:47.869
Remy Danton. Was he here?

08:47.953 --> 08:50.163
He was.
Just checking on your progress.

08:50.247 --> 08:52.707
Go ahead, make that fist for me.

09:00.715 --> 09:04.594
Oh...

09:04.678 --> 09:06.179
- Lion.
- Mm-hm.

09:06.263 --> 09:08.265
Rhinoceros.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.058
- Camel.
- Good.

09:10.142 --> 09:11.893
What color is Rudolph's nose?

09:15.147 --> 09:17.732
- Rudolph?
- Reindeer.

09:19.651 --> 09:21.153
Red.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.073
It's red.

09:25.157 --> 09:27.409
The President of the United States?

09:31.163 --> 09:32.581
Douglas?

09:32.664 --> 09:35.083
Who is the President
of the United States?

09:39.296 --> 09:41.173
Frank Underwood.

09:42.591 --> 09:44.384
- What year are we in?
- 2014.

09:44.468 --> 09:46.303
What month is it?

09:48.680 --> 09:50.515
It's December.

09:58.690 --> 10:00.650
I have to get back to work.

10:02.194 --> 10:04.488
Douglas. Listen to me.

10:04.571 --> 10:08.366
- You suffered a compound fracture...
- I know what I fucking suffered!

10:09.201 --> 10:11.161
I need you to hear me this time.

10:12.829 --> 10:15.665
There was damage
to your left frontal cortex.

10:15.749 --> 10:21.004
Your motor skills will be a struggle.
Your emotions will be unpredictable.

10:21.087 --> 10:24.090
There's a long road ahead,
and we can't rush it.

10:26.968 --> 10:28.970
- Let's do the test later.
- No.

10:30.889 --> 10:32.641
We'll finish it now.

10:35.018 --> 10:36.478
What was your mother's name?

10:36.561 --> 10:39.147
She was young and beautiful.

10:39.231 --> 10:43.193
Jacob fell in love with her
while she was watering a lamb, and...

10:43.276 --> 10:46.363
she became his wife
after he worked seven years

10:46.446 --> 10:48.657
to earn her hand in marriage.

10:51.243 --> 10:54.621
Push back.
Heel into my hand.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.667
Breathe.

10:58.750 --> 11:01.127
Back up. Deep breath.
Ready?

11:03.171 --> 11:06.633
Push. Push.

11:06.716 --> 11:09.177
Hey, Doug.

11:09.261 --> 11:10.804
Focus.

11:12.555 --> 11:14.516
The report I submit to Congress today

11:14.599 --> 11:18.436
includes evidence that would normally
warrant criminal prosecution,

11:18.520 --> 11:21.022
but the Justice Department
won't pursue charges

11:21.106 --> 11:23.900
in accordance
with the presidential pardons.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.945
I'm grateful for the hard work
Ms. Dunbar and her team

11:27.028 --> 11:29.698
have dedicated to their investigation.

11:29.781 --> 11:32.701
In response, I'll be forming
a bipartisan commission to examine

11:32.784 --> 11:36.246
campaign finance reform
so history does not repeat itself,

11:36.329 --> 11:39.040
and so that our nation can heal
from these wounds.

11:39.124 --> 11:41.209
I got bacon-cheese and regular.
Which one you want?

11:41.293 --> 11:42.502
Just a minute.

11:43.295 --> 11:47.590
Remember when you'd never eat a burger
if it didn't have bacon on it?

11:47.674 --> 11:51.678
Dad would get so pissed because he hated
the smell of bacon grease on the grill.

11:51.761 --> 11:53.179
I'm trying to listen, Gary.

11:53.263 --> 11:56.433
The president's hands
are tied. Might as well let him burn.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.643
They're getting their
marshmallows ready.

11:58.727 --> 12:00.812
Look at Underwood's approval rating.

12:00.895 --> 12:02.856
It's worse than Walker's
before he resigned.

12:02.939 --> 12:05.233
That's a deep, deep hole
to climb out of.

12:05.317 --> 12:07.235
The Republicans are gonna
have their fun for a while.

12:07.319 --> 12:10.488
Plenty to hammer him on
in the general. And they're out for blood.

12:10.572 --> 12:12.615
They lost big on education
and entitlement reform.

12:12.699 --> 12:15.327
And if the rumors
about America Works are true...

12:15.410 --> 12:17.329
For the left,
that's just too far to the right

12:17.412 --> 12:19.039
and for the right,
it's too far to the left.

12:19.122 --> 12:21.374
They need me back.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.251
Where? The White House?

12:23.335 --> 12:26.212
We got to turn the corner,
start ramping up for 2016.

12:26.296 --> 12:27.589
He might turn this around.

12:27.672 --> 12:29.591
You don't really think
he's gonna win, do you?

12:29.674 --> 12:31.343
The guy's experienced.
Underwood has a lot...

12:31.426 --> 12:33.094
He'll recover.

12:33.178 --> 12:35.680
He's a behind-the-scenes guy.
He's not comfortable in the spotlight.

12:35.764 --> 12:39.768
- How about you recover first?
- ...glad-handing and kissing babies.

12:39.851 --> 12:42.812
This is gonna be a long 18 months
if this proves any indication.

12:42.896 --> 12:46.232
It can be a lot of chest-thumping
but nothing really getting done.

12:46.316 --> 12:49.736
The Xybenetrin
will help with depression.

12:49.819 --> 12:52.405
The buspirone is for anxiety.
Here you go.

12:55.492 --> 12:59.371
I'd like to prescribe you something
for the pain, but with your...

12:59.454 --> 13:01.748
Well, any patient with a history
of addictive behavior...

13:01.831 --> 13:04.667
I know. It's fine.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.336
I can handle the pain.

13:38.326 --> 13:40.036
He looks a lot better.

13:41.413 --> 13:43.289
No, he's still asleep.

13:45.917 --> 13:47.419
I have to go.

13:47.502 --> 13:48.670
Okay.

13:49.754 --> 13:51.881
Is this a bad time?

13:53.508 --> 13:55.009
No. It's fine.

13:55.093 --> 13:57.303
No, it's just no one told me
you were coming.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.683
Hi. Francis sends his love.

14:01.766 --> 14:03.935
He would visit himself,
but with the media...

14:04.018 --> 14:05.895
No, I understand.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.940
He did come before, when...

14:09.816 --> 14:11.317
- Both of us.
- I know.

14:11.401 --> 14:13.194
I saw the flowers.
Thank you.

14:13.278 --> 14:15.071
- You look well.
- I'm getting there.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.240
I just want to get better
so I can get back to work.

14:17.323 --> 14:19.701
We're looking forward to that.

14:20.368 --> 14:22.871
We can use all the help
we can get, actually.

14:22.954 --> 14:24.497
Yeah. Been watching the news.

14:24.581 --> 14:27.834
Francis, he's at his wit's end.
The Republicans...

14:27.917 --> 14:30.712
won't send him a single bill
he can sign.

14:30.795 --> 14:33.506
- And the Democrats aren't much better.
- Bob Birch?

14:33.590 --> 14:36.342
Blind leading the stupid.

14:37.927 --> 14:39.888
How's Remy working out?

14:39.971 --> 14:44.225
Well, we'd much rather have you there,
but he's doing a fine job.

14:46.060 --> 14:49.481
Doug, do you... recall anything?

14:49.564 --> 14:51.649
- About what happened?
- Why?

14:51.733 --> 14:53.026
Did the police find something?

14:53.109 --> 14:56.196
Not that we're aware of. And we've
asked them to hold off questioning you

14:56.279 --> 14:58.406
until you're feeling more like yourself.

15:01.618 --> 15:04.871
Rachel, she...

15:09.751 --> 15:11.836
I don't remember.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.881
Yes, you do.

15:19.511 --> 15:21.930
A carjacking.

15:22.013 --> 15:24.224
- A man.
- What sort of man?

15:24.307 --> 15:26.267
That part's fuzzy.

15:26.351 --> 15:28.228
It could be anyone, then.
Any man.

15:28.311 --> 15:30.563
Yeah. Any man.

15:30.647 --> 15:33.900
- And he got frightened?
- I chased him and that's all.

15:36.569 --> 15:40.532
- Any idea where she is?
- No.

15:40.615 --> 15:43.409
Because it's important that we find her.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.913
I really don't know.

15:48.498 --> 15:49.666
That's the truth.

15:53.628 --> 15:57.131
I want you to tell all of this
to the police, exactly what you told me,

15:57.215 --> 15:59.926
about the carjacking and the man.
Nothing about her.

16:00.009 --> 16:01.719
I got it.

16:01.803 --> 16:05.056
If you need anything,
or remember anything...

16:09.060 --> 16:11.646
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.131
That's good. One more time.
Up and forward. That's good.

16:38.214 --> 16:39.966
Excellent. Breathe.

16:40.049 --> 16:41.509
Good.

16:41.593 --> 16:43.094
Good. Good.

16:45.263 --> 16:46.806
Okay.

16:46.890 --> 16:50.101
Let's try this one.
You're doing a great job.

16:51.603 --> 16:53.605
Keep breathing. Good.

16:54.689 --> 16:56.232
Good job, Doug.

16:57.901 --> 17:01.321
Okay. Moving forward.
You got it.

17:01.404 --> 17:02.780
Great. Great job.

17:02.864 --> 17:04.198
Keep going.

17:05.032 --> 17:06.492
Good. Breathe.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.371
Excellent. Good.

17:10.454 --> 17:12.498
One more.

17:12.582 --> 17:14.041
Great job.

17:14.125 --> 17:15.919
One more time.
It's almost done. Ready?

17:16.002 --> 17:17.337
Keep breathing.

17:17.420 --> 17:19.881
Just his voice.
He said, "Get out of the car."

17:19.964 --> 17:21.840
Anything you can say about the voice?

17:21.925 --> 17:25.428
Was it, uh...
Accent? Lisp? High? Low?

17:25.511 --> 17:27.180
Deep.

17:28.056 --> 17:29.098
That's all I remember.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.269
Then I laid on the horn. I...

17:35.021 --> 17:37.106
I remember him running.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.275
Like a blur, I got out.

17:40.068 --> 17:41.903
I chased him.

17:44.739 --> 17:46.366
I'm not sure. I must have...

17:47.367 --> 17:49.577
What were you doing
in that part of Maryland?

17:53.957 --> 17:55.375
Mr. Stamper?

17:55.458 --> 17:58.670
Sir. What were you doing
in that part of Maryland?

18:01.547 --> 18:03.591
I drive sometimes to think.

18:03.675 --> 18:06.719
There was a lot on my mind with work.
I drive to clear my head.

18:09.472 --> 18:11.307
Have you found the car?

18:12.225 --> 18:14.811
We don't have anything
other than what you just told us.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.442
How's your mood been?
Any episodes?

18:21.526 --> 18:22.735
No. The meds are working.

18:22.819 --> 18:24.278
You just telling me what I want to hear?

18:24.362 --> 18:27.198
No. I feel good.

18:27.281 --> 18:28.491
Okay.

18:28.574 --> 18:31.327
I'm gonna sign your release today.

18:31.411 --> 18:34.497
But it's important
you take it easy at first.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.749
Everything's gonna be
much harder in general.

18:36.833 --> 18:37.959
I know.

18:38.042 --> 18:39.585
Do you have someone
who can look after you?

18:39.669 --> 18:42.046
Yeah. My brother Gary's in from Ohio.

18:42.130 --> 18:43.965
Good. How long is he here for?

18:44.048 --> 18:47.218
- A while, I guess.
- Okay, great.

18:47.301 --> 18:51.264
It's important you go to your meetings.
Stay on top of your sobriety.

18:52.932 --> 18:56.394
Take this.
It's for the steroids I prescribed you.

18:56.477 --> 19:00.940
It's one shot into the right thigh,
once a week. The nurse, she...

19:01.024 --> 19:02.400
- She showed me how.
- Okay.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.048
You do this?

19:25.131 --> 19:26.841
No, it wasn't me.

19:55.787 --> 19:57.121
I talked to my boss.

19:57.205 --> 20:00.291
I can stick around
for another couple of weeks

20:00.374 --> 20:03.127
- while you transition back.
- You should get back to your family.

20:03.211 --> 20:04.754
Nah... Sarah's fine with it.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.297
The kids are, too.

20:06.380 --> 20:09.425
Gary, we've hardly spoken in ten years.

20:09.509 --> 20:12.011
You've already gone above and beyond.

20:12.637 --> 20:16.057
All right.
You want me to go?

20:17.058 --> 20:18.059
I'm fine.

20:19.060 --> 20:21.312
Thanks for everything.

20:21.395 --> 20:22.688
Okay.

20:22.772 --> 20:26.067
I mean, I'm just a phone call
and a plane ticket away.

20:33.157 --> 20:34.742
Safe travels.

20:35.910 --> 20:37.870
Uh...

20:37.954 --> 20:39.288
Take care.

20:44.252 --> 20:46.212
Hey, Gary, I...

20:49.048 --> 20:50.591
Send me some pictures of the kids.

20:53.386 --> 20:54.887
Yeah, I will.

21:07.984 --> 21:10.736
But one of the things I admire
about you is that in Washington, DC,

21:10.820 --> 21:13.364
which is so gridlocked,
you get things done.

21:13.447 --> 21:16.367
And I understand you've got, um,
a new piece of legislation,

21:16.450 --> 21:19.162
a major new initiative
you're rolling out. What is it?

21:19.245 --> 21:22.748
That is correct. It's a new jobs program
that we're calling America Works.

21:22.832 --> 21:26.544
Oh. So it's a fantasy novel.

21:26.627 --> 21:28.588
This is
a fundamentally different look

21:28.671 --> 21:31.007
at how to solve
the problem of unemployment.

21:31.090 --> 21:34.010
It has the size
and the scope of the New Deal.

21:34.093 --> 21:37.346
Oh. So it's a socialist
redistribution of wealth

21:37.430 --> 21:40.016
wherein the baby boomers
will latch onto the millennials

21:40.099 --> 21:43.853
like a lamprey and just keep sucking
until they're as dry as a crouton?

21:46.314 --> 21:48.232
This is about
putting people to work

21:48.316 --> 21:50.568
and avoiding the entitlements entirely.

21:50.651 --> 21:52.069
Well, I like the sound of that.

21:52.153 --> 21:54.113
So what, we're gonna
privatize Social Security

21:54.197 --> 21:57.116
and then raise revenue
by hunting the elderly for sport?

21:58.576 --> 22:00.578
- Good plan. Use that.
- No, as I said,

22:00.661 --> 22:02.872
this is a fundamentally
different approach entirely.

22:02.955 --> 22:06.125
And you think that the Republicans
in Congress will cooperate with you?

22:06.209 --> 22:10.296
Oh, I think that it has been proved
that both parties want the same thing.

22:10.379 --> 22:13.257
A new president in 2016?

22:13.341 --> 22:17.511
No. No, I think actually,
I think unemployment, eradicating it,

22:17.595 --> 22:20.139
and I think a strong economy
is something both parties want.

22:20.223 --> 22:23.476
Okay, speaking of everyone,
there's a recent poll by Reuters.

22:23.559 --> 22:26.103
I wanna get this right.
It says that eight out of ten Americans

22:26.187 --> 22:29.815
agree that you lack, quote,
"effectiveness and leadership."

22:29.899 --> 22:32.693
Uh, look,
I don't let polls like that bother me.

22:32.777 --> 22:35.905
I think that once the nation
sees AmWorks in action,

22:35.988 --> 22:39.408
- they will change their attitudes.
- I'm sorry, "AmWorks?"

22:39.492 --> 22:41.532
I'm sorry... I didn't realize
it was called AmWorks.

22:41.535 --> 22:44.205
Is that like Amway?
Is it a pyramid scheme?

22:44.288 --> 22:46.415
Is that what you're selling
the American people?

22:46.499 --> 22:49.502
No, it's actually just an abbreviation
to make it easier to say.

22:49.585 --> 22:53.506
Well, if you make it small enough,
uh, maybe it'll be easier to swallow.

22:56.842 --> 22:59.553
You know, even though
you're a Democrat, I respect you.

22:59.637 --> 23:02.264
But let's just take a look
at the facts here for a second.

23:02.348 --> 23:06.268
You've been president for six months,
and again, I wanna get this right,

23:06.352 --> 23:09.689
unemployment has gone up, our trade
deficit with China has increased,

23:09.772 --> 23:11.774
the number of vetoes has skyrocketed.

23:11.857 --> 23:14.443
I'm not entirely sure that I'm confident

23:14.527 --> 23:17.947
that you'll be able to eradicate
unemployment the same way

23:18.030 --> 23:20.616
you've been able
to eradicate your approval polls.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.785
What, you know, what do you...

23:22.868 --> 23:25.538
How are you going to get it across
to the American people?

23:40.970 --> 23:43.806
- Doug?
- Seth?

23:43.889 --> 23:46.058
Yeah, it's me.

23:46.142 --> 23:48.227
Mrs. Underwood,
she gave me this phone, but...

23:48.310 --> 23:50.104
I know. Is something wrong?

23:51.147 --> 23:53.899
No. I want to speak to the president.

23:53.983 --> 23:55.568
Is it urgent?

23:55.651 --> 23:57.653
I want to talk to him
about the America Works program.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.489
- So nothing urgent.
- It's not an emergency, no.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.908
'Cause that's what this phone is for.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.537
Will you pass on my message?

24:39.028 --> 24:42.490
Ah!

25:28.369 --> 25:29.620
Hey.

25:32.498 --> 25:33.499
You're late.

25:33.582 --> 25:36.001
I switched cabs three times.

25:36.085 --> 25:39.171
- Were you being followed?
- Didn't want to take chances.

25:41.924 --> 25:44.802
- You know why I asked you here.
- I don't know where she is.

25:44.885 --> 25:47.596
- Then you need to find out.
- I ran her social, her name,

25:47.680 --> 25:49.473
police records, taxes, everything.

25:49.557 --> 25:52.143
She could be tossed in a ditch
by a john for all I know.

25:52.226 --> 25:54.603
- You work at the FBI.
- What do I get in return?

25:54.687 --> 25:56.605
My protection, like you asked.

25:56.689 --> 25:59.191
I thought you had something to offer.
Something real.

25:59.275 --> 26:00.609
Like money?

26:00.693 --> 26:04.530
Like getting me out of the Bureau. You
make that happen, maybe I can help you.

26:04.613 --> 26:07.700
That was a condition,
for your charges being dropped.

26:11.162 --> 26:13.330
See, you don't still know people.

26:14.999 --> 26:18.127
- I shouldn't have even come here.
- I am your only safety net.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.629
You think I would have turned over
all the AT&T records

26:20.713 --> 26:22.298
without leaving a backup with somebody?

26:22.381 --> 26:25.050
I'm not gonna blow my get-out-of-jail
card on a wild goose chase.

26:27.803 --> 26:29.889
Does anyone suspect anything?

26:29.972 --> 26:31.432
At the Bureau?

26:33.309 --> 26:35.311
Nobody has a clue about her.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.521
If that gives you any peace of mind.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.540
Doug?

26:56.624 --> 26:58.792
Tell him it's urgent.

26:58.876 --> 27:00.669
We're aiming for sometime in May.

27:00.753 --> 27:03.297
As soon as we agree on a date
with the Russian delegation,

27:03.380 --> 27:06.091
you will be the first to know. Uh, Greg.

27:06.175 --> 27:07.843
The Summit with Petrov
here in Washington,

27:07.927 --> 27:09.678
what'll be the focus of the talks?

27:09.762 --> 27:11.889
A bilateral approach to the Middle East.

27:11.972 --> 27:14.266
As you know, the Palestinians
have refused to negotiate

27:14.350 --> 27:16.393
until Israeli troops
leave the Jordan Valley.

27:16.477 --> 27:19.146
We hope to address
this with President Petrov

27:19.230 --> 27:21.523
so that we can move on
to a whole host of other issues.

27:21.607 --> 27:22.441
Sara.

27:22.524 --> 27:25.402
So this bilateral approach doesn't
include Israel and Palestine.

27:25.486 --> 27:27.988
The State Department
is briefing all interested parties.

27:28.072 --> 27:30.324
The summit's really just a first step.
Ayla.

27:30.407 --> 27:32.618
I'd like to change course
to the America Works program.

27:32.701 --> 27:33.577
Please.

27:33.661 --> 27:35.981
I've spoken to a number
of the president's policy advisors,

27:35.996 --> 27:38.540
who say there's been a lot
of disagreement on the economic team

27:38.624 --> 27:41.627
as to exactly what form
this jobs package should take.

27:41.710 --> 27:43.587
- Which advisors?
- Nice try.

27:43.671 --> 27:47.758
To be clear, this is far more
than just a jobs package.

27:47.841 --> 27:52.554
It is a comprehensive plan, which aims
at full employment within two years.

27:52.638 --> 27:55.015
So as such, there are a lot
of details to be worked out.

27:55.099 --> 27:56.892
So your sources are inaccurate.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.936
It's not so much a disagreement

27:59.019 --> 28:01.897
as it is debating the finer points
of the plan. Jess.

28:01.981 --> 28:04.441
Just to follow up.
What are some of the finer points?

28:04.525 --> 28:07.278
Or the broad strokes, even. No one
from the White House has said anything.

28:07.361 --> 28:10.239
When we have a plan to present,
we will present it.

28:10.322 --> 28:11.907
Jess?

28:11.991 --> 28:15.411
Is America Works a reaction
to the president's low approval ratings?

28:15.494 --> 28:18.289
An effort to offer some sign of progress
ramping up to the elections?

28:18.372 --> 28:20.173
We've been working on this plan
since day one.

28:20.207 --> 28:21.875
It has nothing to do
with the approval ratings.

28:21.959 --> 28:25.212
But as for the election...
uh, whose turn is it to ask today?

28:25.296 --> 28:28.799
- Mark?
- Is the president running in 2016?

28:28.882 --> 28:31.969
Today, the priority
is good government, but...

28:32.052 --> 28:34.555
Ask me again tomorrow.

28:34.638 --> 28:36.390
Thank you, everyone.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.393
We've got a window at ten.

28:39.476 --> 28:40.978
I'll call him now.

28:45.107 --> 28:46.859
Please, sit down.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.278
John. Samantha.

28:49.361 --> 28:52.156
You spoke to a journalist
about disagreements in this room?

28:52.239 --> 28:54.408
If that happens again,
you're off the team.

28:54.491 --> 28:56.869
And speaking of the disagreements
in this room,

28:56.952 --> 28:59.955
we now have an even bigger one,
because Remy has shown me

29:00.039 --> 29:03.000
your work so far and...

29:03.083 --> 29:04.877
it's toothless.

29:04.960 --> 29:09.006
I stood in this room three months ago
and gave you all very clear direction.

29:09.089 --> 29:11.842
Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,

29:11.925 --> 29:14.762
every entitlement program
that is sucking us dry,

29:14.845 --> 29:18.057
I want it all on the table.
And this doesn't go nearly far enough.

29:18.140 --> 29:20.684
So we obviously have
to get back to some basics.

29:20.768 --> 29:23.854
Remind ourselves of some of the facts
that are before us...

29:23.937 --> 29:26.065
- Sir, if I may...
- No, no, no, no.

29:27.399 --> 29:31.195
I will speak first,
and then you will speak, Paul.

29:34.615 --> 29:37.117
This is what
the average senior citizen gets,

29:37.201 --> 29:39.119
one year from entitlements,

29:39.203 --> 29:41.705
whether they were a janitor
or they ran a hedge fund.

29:41.789 --> 29:45.584
That... This money is a job

29:45.668 --> 29:48.921
we could be giving to a single mother
or a student just out of school.

29:49.004 --> 29:50.381
Now, at the moment,

29:50.464 --> 29:54.802
44 cents of every tax dollar
goes to pay for these programs.

29:54.885 --> 29:58.055
By 2030, it'll be over half, 62 cents.

29:58.138 --> 30:00.891
Entitlements are bankrupting us.

30:00.974 --> 30:03.352
Now, I had Remy conduct a little poll.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.729
Statement posed was:
"Doing what's best for my country

30:05.813 --> 30:07.398
means doing some things
that I don't like."

30:07.481 --> 30:09.900
Seventy-four percent agreed
with this statement.

30:09.983 --> 30:13.612
Seventy-four percent.
Now, what does that tell us?

30:13.696 --> 30:17.825
We have to do the things
that people won't like.

30:17.908 --> 30:21.537
And even when we do, three out of four
of them will go along with us.

30:21.620 --> 30:24.456
And why?
Because we're promising jobs.

30:24.540 --> 30:27.543
And again, where are the three areas

30:27.626 --> 30:30.921
that we're gonna be
creating these jobs from?

30:31.004 --> 30:33.966
Infrastructure at the state
and federal level.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.051
Increasing the size of the military,

30:36.135 --> 30:38.535
and working with our friends
in the private sector to start...

30:38.554 --> 30:41.056
I'm sorry, sir,
but I have to interrupt.

30:41.140 --> 30:44.309
The programs that you want
to scale back or dismantle

30:44.393 --> 30:46.729
are the bedrock
of the American dream.

30:46.812 --> 30:48.480
You work hard, you pay your taxes...

30:48.564 --> 30:51.483
No, I'm sorry, they were
the bedrock of the American dream.

30:51.567 --> 30:53.152
But they're not anymore.

30:53.235 --> 30:56.280
Certainly not for the ten million people
who are out of work.

30:56.363 --> 30:59.575
But practically speaking,
a thousand special interests,

30:59.658 --> 31:02.202
organized labor,
opposition in both parties.

31:02.286 --> 31:05.205
Now, we can do a version
of what you're proposing...

31:05.289 --> 31:08.000
I don't want a version.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.335
I want a vision.

31:11.295 --> 31:15.466
As head of this team,
and I think I speak for everyone,

31:15.549 --> 31:18.343
- we have done...
- Speaking as the president,

31:18.427 --> 31:21.221
who chose this team
and for whom it works,

31:21.305 --> 31:26.351
I want five hundred billion dollars
to put ten million people to work.

31:26.435 --> 31:28.270
I don't care how much it hurts.

31:28.353 --> 31:30.731
I don't care how controversial it is.

31:30.814 --> 31:33.442
Your job is to find a way.

31:33.525 --> 31:37.654
It's my job to convince Congress
and the American people.

31:37.738 --> 31:42.701
Your job is not to sell me
on your version of my program.

31:43.744 --> 31:46.330
Now, are we all clear
on what our jobs are?

31:46.413 --> 31:50.584
Good, because I want to present this
proposal to leadership in 30 days.

31:50.667 --> 31:52.628
- Let's make it happen.
- Paul?

31:57.883 --> 32:00.385
- Your services are no longer needed.
- Excuse me?

32:00.469 --> 32:02.679
Let's keep it quiet,
let's keep it cordial.

32:02.763 --> 32:05.390
- Thanks for all your work.
- I'll get my things.

32:05.474 --> 32:07.726
I'll have them sent down
to you in the lobby.

32:41.510 --> 32:42.928
Hello?

32:44.429 --> 32:46.557
Yeah. I'm on my way.

33:16.253 --> 33:18.839
Ah! Oh!

33:22.175 --> 33:24.803
Ah! God!

33:24.887 --> 33:28.390
Ah!

33:58.462 --> 34:00.422
Oh!

34:03.800 --> 34:05.802
Ah!

34:09.973 --> 34:11.224
Ah!

34:12.391 --> 34:13.393
Mm...

34:18.440 --> 34:20.775
Ahh!

34:20.859 --> 34:23.612
God!

34:30.159 --> 34:33.080
It'll be a few minutes.
Please, have a seat.

34:49.972 --> 34:53.016
- How long have you known?
- Two months.

34:53.100 --> 34:55.768
It hasn't impaired my judgment
on the bench.

34:55.851 --> 35:00.357
And it's early on. We don't expect
any real symptoms for quite some time.

35:00.440 --> 35:06.405
I won't be wandering around the Supreme
Court in my boxer shorts anytime soon.

35:06.488 --> 35:11.326
But I'd like to retire now,
long before we get there.

35:11.410 --> 35:14.121
Well, Justice, I want to thank you
for having the courage

35:14.204 --> 35:18.333
to come and share this news with me.
Are you sure the diagnosis is correct?

35:18.417 --> 35:21.628
My doctor's the same
that treated the vice president's wife.

35:21.712 --> 35:24.589
He's the foremost
Alzheimer's specialist in America.

35:25.590 --> 35:27.718
Yes, I made Donald my vice president.

35:27.801 --> 35:30.470
I'd rather him be a pain in my ass here
than over in Congress.

35:30.554 --> 35:33.890
And even the Republicans couldn't
refuse a man who just buried his wife.

35:33.974 --> 35:35.642
Terrible how quickly Marjory went.

35:35.726 --> 35:40.063
I'm telling you this now so you
have time to think about candidates

35:40.147 --> 35:42.733
before I announce my retirement.

35:42.816 --> 35:45.610
- How much time can you give me?
- How much do you need?

35:45.694 --> 35:48.238
I'm about to introduce
America Works to Congress.

35:48.321 --> 35:50.991
It's sure to be an uphill battle.
And I'd prefer not to add

35:51.074 --> 35:53.702
a Supreme Court nomination to the mix.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.871
The Republicans will just
use it as leverage.

35:55.954 --> 35:59.041
I've heard rumblings.
Entitlements on the chopping block?

35:59.124 --> 36:01.251
All the more reason
to keep you on the bench.

36:01.334 --> 36:04.004
It's sure to be challenged
in the Judiciary.

36:04.087 --> 36:08.759
Mr. President,
I want to spend as much time

36:08.842 --> 36:11.344
with my wife as possible

36:11.428 --> 36:15.265
in the good years that I have left.

36:15.348 --> 36:18.393
When Marjory was ill,
she wanted the same thing.

36:18.477 --> 36:21.271
She left the Smithsonian,
and you know what?

36:21.354 --> 36:24.691
She hated every second of being at home,
of not being productive,

36:24.775 --> 36:27.235
of not doing what she loved.

36:27.319 --> 36:30.781
It made her time
with us much harder, and...

36:31.948 --> 36:34.367
it made her deeply unhappy.

36:34.451 --> 36:37.829
Work is the best distraction.
I wish she hadn't retired.

36:37.913 --> 36:41.875
And, uh...
before she lost her lucid thought,

36:41.958 --> 36:43.710
she said she regretted it, too.

36:43.794 --> 36:47.672
Can you give me six months?
A year at the most? That's all.

36:47.756 --> 36:50.175
Just enough time
to get this program up and running

36:50.258 --> 36:52.844
before I have
to face a Supreme Court fight.

36:55.555 --> 36:57.557
- I need to think it over.
- Oh, of course.

36:57.641 --> 37:00.310
- Speak to your wife.
- I'll walk you out.

37:04.815 --> 37:08.151
- I better get that research center.
- Yes, a deal is a deal.

37:08.235 --> 37:10.862
Now, good God, Donald,
let's get something done.

37:14.616 --> 37:16.910
Now you see why Donald said yes.

37:16.993 --> 37:20.664
He may hate my guts, but there's
nothing like a death in the family

37:20.747 --> 37:22.958
to separate the wheat from the bullshit.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.042
Send him in.

37:24.126 --> 37:25.836
Yes, sir.

37:25.919 --> 37:28.171
The president is ready to see you now.

37:48.525 --> 37:50.110
Doug.

37:51.778 --> 37:53.446
Mr. President.

37:55.615 --> 37:58.368
The doctor told me your recovery
is going very well.

37:58.451 --> 38:00.120
Yeah. Well, there's this.

38:00.203 --> 38:02.247
But everything else is as good as new.

38:02.330 --> 38:04.416
It's great to see you.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.376
Claire and I have been
worried sick about you.

38:06.459 --> 38:07.669
Thank you for the gifts.

38:07.752 --> 38:09.296
- Well...
- For looking out for me.

38:09.379 --> 38:12.215
I don't have that many close friends.
I count you among them.

38:13.216 --> 38:17.012
- I appreciate your saying that, sir.
- Oh, drop the "sir." We're old pals.

38:18.096 --> 38:19.556
Well...

38:20.432 --> 38:23.059
I'm the one who should apologize.

38:23.143 --> 38:26.354
You gave me another chance.
You trusted me.

38:27.564 --> 38:29.774
And what happened,
I take responsibility for that.

38:29.858 --> 38:32.652
- No, for putting you in that position.
- Stop. It's not necessary.

38:32.736 --> 38:35.238
- I endangered you just as...
- Yeah, but all I care about

38:35.322 --> 38:38.158
is that you are alive
and getting better.

38:38.241 --> 38:40.285
Let the rest of it go.

38:41.661 --> 38:44.247
- You know how devoted I am.
- You don't have to say it.

38:44.331 --> 38:46.625
You proved it time and time again.

38:46.708 --> 38:48.418
Now, come on, come on, sit down.

38:50.170 --> 38:51.671
Right here.

39:14.110 --> 39:16.821
I should've taken care of her
when I had the chance.

39:19.824 --> 39:21.451
I haven't found her yet.

39:22.494 --> 39:25.872
But when I do, I'll make sure
that no one else does.

39:25.956 --> 39:27.916
You can count on that, sir.

39:30.043 --> 39:31.628
How is it, uh...?

39:31.711 --> 39:33.755
Probably better
if we don't talk about it.

39:33.838 --> 39:35.590
Right, of course.

39:38.301 --> 39:40.887
Well, they told me you needed to see me.

39:42.973 --> 39:46.685
Well, sir, I...
I know that it's a lot to ask,

39:46.768 --> 39:50.188
and that I probably don't deserve it,
considering the mess I put us in.

39:50.272 --> 39:53.108
And I'm sure you have your doubts.

39:53.191 --> 39:55.568
I realize it couldn't
be anything too visible, but...

39:55.652 --> 39:57.529
I've been following everything
with America Works.

39:57.612 --> 40:01.241
- Oh. Well, that's a ways off.
- But I was thinking that I could help.

40:02.117 --> 40:05.203
There should be a targeted plan
for lobbying committee leadership.

40:05.287 --> 40:06.871
And I can work with the political team,

40:06.955 --> 40:09.165
coordinate with House leg directors,
chiefs of staff...

40:09.249 --> 40:12.752
I was in Gaffney yesterday,
visiting my father's grave.

40:13.628 --> 40:15.547
He never took care of himself.

40:15.630 --> 40:20.176
He ignored his heart problems
and... he paid the price.

40:21.928 --> 40:24.931
You have to respect
your own mortality, Doug.

40:25.015 --> 40:27.309
I don't want to be standing
over your grave.

40:27.392 --> 40:29.436
Now, look...

40:29.519 --> 40:33.815
There is a place
for you here, I promise.

40:33.898 --> 40:35.984
But we have to go about this slowly.

40:36.067 --> 40:39.029
I'll work from home.
Only direct contact with you or Remy.

40:39.112 --> 40:40.913
You know the way
that you can help me the best

40:40.947 --> 40:42.824
is to do exactly
what you're doing right now,

40:42.907 --> 40:44.659
focusing on your recovery.

40:44.743 --> 40:49.205
I would never forgive myself if I
put too much on your plate too soon.

40:52.792 --> 40:54.127
You're right.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.589
I'm sorry.

41:04.888 --> 41:05.889
Thank you.

41:05.972 --> 41:07.599
I'm sorry, I have to go.

41:07.682 --> 41:10.435
But look, I meant what I said.

41:10.518 --> 41:13.104
When you are truly ready.

41:13.188 --> 41:14.564
Yes, sir.

41:15.482 --> 41:17.275
Stay as long as you like.

41:35.960 --> 41:40.131
Three hours ago, we pinpointed him here,
in the Shabwa region of Yemen.

41:40.965 --> 41:41.965
Cooperation?

41:42.008 --> 41:44.219
I spoke to the foreign minister
a few minutes ago.

41:44.302 --> 41:46.388
- Civilians?
- Two dozen, non-IDs.

41:46.471 --> 41:48.098
That's too many.

41:48.181 --> 41:51.059
Our concern is that he could
be on the move at any moment.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.103
Sir, with Petrov
coming to Washington...

41:53.186 --> 41:55.522
It's taken us two years
to track Abdullah down.

41:55.605 --> 41:58.191
We can't ignore every opportunity
between now and the summit.

41:59.859 --> 42:01.319
Do you have eyes on the village?

42:01.403 --> 42:04.864
Yes, sir. He's in this building here.

42:04.948 --> 42:07.575
Kill zone is anyone within 50 meters.

42:09.828 --> 42:13.039
If we take him out with no civilian
casualties, I'll authorize the strike.

42:13.123 --> 42:14.791
Sir, if I may, I really think...

42:14.874 --> 42:18.711
President Petrov is coming
to Washington in less than two months.

42:18.795 --> 42:21.798
Our entire Middle East policy
hinges on that meeting.

42:21.881 --> 42:25.218
We don't want to give
the Muslim community any viable reasons

42:25.301 --> 42:27.971
to obstruct things if we can avoid it.

42:28.054 --> 42:30.055
So find a way to do this
without killing civilians.

42:30.056 --> 42:31.099
Thank you all very much.

42:31.182 --> 42:35.103
May I have a moment?
It's about Claire.

42:35.186 --> 42:38.857
If your husband nominates you,
I can't pull any punches.

42:38.940 --> 42:41.401
Lack of experience. Nepotism.

42:41.484 --> 42:43.027
That's right.

42:43.111 --> 42:48.116
- And you think I'm a dilettante.
- No. But plenty of people will.

42:48.199 --> 42:50.326
I've been preparing
since Francis took office.

42:50.410 --> 42:54.164
What I lack in experience
I'll make up for in work ethic.

42:54.247 --> 42:55.915
Why Ambassador to the UN?

42:55.999 --> 42:58.209
You wield far more influence
as the First Lady.

42:58.293 --> 43:01.045
That's not the same
as contributing in a concrete way.

43:01.129 --> 43:03.631
If we vote down your confirmation,

43:03.715 --> 43:08.261
are you comfortable
with that sort of public embarrassment?

43:08.344 --> 43:09.846
I know that's a risk.

43:12.140 --> 43:15.602
- You're running in 2016, right?
- No comment.

43:15.685 --> 43:18.062
Francis and I are impressed

43:18.146 --> 43:20.982
by how the Republicans
are consolidating around you.

43:21.065 --> 43:22.400
You'll make a good candidate.

43:22.484 --> 43:24.986
Not by linking arms
with the president's wife.

43:25.069 --> 43:29.824
If I'm a disaster,
it makes for a good campaign ad.

43:29.908 --> 43:32.368
If I do a good job,
nobody can fault you.

43:32.452 --> 43:35.622
Either way,
it doesn't hurt your chances in 2016.

43:37.582 --> 43:41.336
Well, I appreciate you
coming by before going public.

43:41.419 --> 43:44.631
It is classy, and thoughtful.

43:45.465 --> 43:47.467
I won't actively block you.

43:47.550 --> 43:49.969
The rest is on your shoulders.

43:50.929 --> 43:53.097
Thank you, Senator.

43:53.598 --> 43:56.434
Tell the president I'm doing this
out of respect to you.

43:57.393 --> 43:59.646
Frank's still on my shit list
till I beat him in the general.

43:59.729 --> 44:01.147
I will.

44:02.232 --> 44:04.317
Why didn't you come right away?

44:04.400 --> 44:06.444
I had a meeting I couldn't miss.

44:06.528 --> 44:08.029
Fucking Washington.

44:08.112 --> 44:10.573
- This is gonna hurt.
- I know.

44:12.367 --> 44:14.911
Ah!

44:15.537 --> 44:17.997
Here's some Percocet.
It'll help with the pain.

44:19.332 --> 44:21.125
I'll write you a 30-day prescription.

44:21.209 --> 44:22.585
I can't.

44:22.669 --> 44:25.004
- I'm not supposed to...
- What was that?

44:27.423 --> 44:29.092
Nothing.

44:37.850 --> 44:39.602
All right. You're good to go.

45:18.683 --> 45:20.226
Hey.

45:20.310 --> 45:22.770
- How did it go with Mendoza?
- Well, I think.

45:22.854 --> 45:24.314
He'll support you?

45:24.397 --> 45:26.816
He won't openly fight it.

45:26.899 --> 45:29.068
Well, that is a big step forward.

45:29.152 --> 45:31.863
- How did it go with Doug?
- No real news.

45:34.615 --> 45:36.284
Hey, are you in here again tonight?

45:36.367 --> 45:39.704
I'm still getting over this cold.
I don't want to get you sick.

45:39.787 --> 45:41.581
Well, don't stay up
with all that too late.

45:41.664 --> 45:43.750
Francis?

45:43.833 --> 45:46.085
When do we announce the nomination?

45:50.798 --> 45:53.092
Listen, I wasn't gonna
bring this up tonight,

45:53.176 --> 45:55.762
but you should know
that there are some serious doubts

45:55.845 --> 45:57.764
from people at the State Department.

45:57.847 --> 45:59.515
You mean Cathy.

45:59.599 --> 46:01.392
And some on her staff.

46:03.936 --> 46:05.104
Like what?

46:05.188 --> 46:08.775
Well, in over your head,
wearing two hats, the obvious things.

46:08.858 --> 46:11.986
And are you saying this
because you don't want to move forward?

46:12.070 --> 46:15.156
Not at all. I'm sharing with you
so you fully understand

46:15.239 --> 46:18.534
- what you're getting into.
- And I do.

46:24.082 --> 46:26.167
Maybe we shouldn't rush this.

46:28.127 --> 46:31.255
- You're having doubts now, too.
- I didn't say that.

46:31.339 --> 46:33.100
Only you should put
more thought into whether

46:33.174 --> 46:36.010
this is the right move for you.
That's all.

46:37.512 --> 46:38.805
Good night, Francis.

46:40.598 --> 46:41.808
Feel better.

47:53.796 --> 47:55.465
Francis.

47:57.008 --> 47:59.677
I want you to announce
the nomination this week.

47:59.760 --> 48:02.763
I don't want to wait.
The timing will never be good.

48:02.847 --> 48:04.182
And I don't want to waste time

48:04.265 --> 48:06.305
when I can be getting
real experience under my belt.

48:06.350 --> 48:09.770
So set a date, hold a press conference,
and let's do it.

48:18.029 --> 48:19.280
Claire!

48:19.363 --> 48:23.743
I was not trying to suggest
that you not be the ambassador

48:23.826 --> 48:26.412
- when I brought up Cathy. I was just...
- We made a deal,

48:26.496 --> 48:28.372
and now you're trying
to back away from it.

48:28.456 --> 48:30.541
- That is not true.
- Then you would've told Cathy

48:30.625 --> 48:32.502
it's happening
to make her peace with that.

48:32.585 --> 48:35.463
- It's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

48:35.546 --> 48:39.342
- You're the president.
- I can't control Congress.

48:39.425 --> 48:42.094
I'm trying to get two
major initiatives off the ground

48:42.178 --> 48:44.305
and every move I make
will have an effect.

48:44.388 --> 48:47.850
We agreed to this before we ever
stepped foot in this house.

48:47.934 --> 48:50.603
- I know what we agreed to.
- How am I supposed to run for office

48:50.686 --> 48:53.481
at some point if I don't have
a legitimate track record?

48:53.564 --> 48:57.026
We have to survive
the next 18 months,

48:57.109 --> 49:00.780
accomplish something,
and then look ahead.

49:02.657 --> 49:04.992
Francis, let's be realistic.

49:06.118 --> 49:08.579
There's no guarantee you'll get elected.

49:08.663 --> 49:10.790
I need to be prepared if you don't.

49:10.873 --> 49:12.833
You have that much faith in me, do you?

49:12.917 --> 49:14.835
More faith than you have in me,
it seems.

49:14.919 --> 49:17.004
I believe in you
more than anyone, Claire.

49:17.088 --> 49:19.799
Then show it. Nominate me.
I shouldn't have to convince you.

49:19.882 --> 49:21.384
It's not about convincing.

49:21.467 --> 49:24.512
It's about being honest
about the political climate

49:24.595 --> 49:27.848
- that we find ourselves...
- I'm almost 50 years old.

49:27.932 --> 49:30.309
I've been in the passenger seat
for decades.

49:30.393 --> 49:32.103
It's time for me
to get behind the wheel.

49:32.186 --> 49:35.982
That needs to start now.
Before the election.

49:36.065 --> 49:38.818
Because who knows what will happen?
What if you lose?

49:41.988 --> 49:45.783
I will not be
a placeholder president, Claire.

49:47.618 --> 49:52.290
I will win.
And I will leave a legacy.

49:52.373 --> 49:54.125
You mean we will.

49:54.208 --> 49:55.501
Excuse me, sir.

49:55.585 --> 49:58.421
The Secretary of Defense is on the line.
He says it's urgent.

50:02.216 --> 50:03.217
Yes?

50:05.469 --> 50:07.096
Okay.

50:07.179 --> 50:08.639
I'm coming.

50:08.723 --> 50:10.266
Not until I get there.

50:10.349 --> 50:12.351
- I'll be right down.
- Yes, sir.

50:18.274 --> 50:20.359
Get dressed.
I want you to see something.

51:17.667 --> 51:19.126
Come in.

51:32.181 --> 51:34.016
- Here.
- Thank you.

51:36.686 --> 51:38.062
Okay, great.

51:39.355 --> 51:40.523
Get undressed.

52:38.789 --> 52:40.708
How did this happen?

52:40.791 --> 52:42.460
Doesn't matter.

52:53.763 --> 52:55.347
Let me help you.

53:05.608 --> 53:07.568
Sh... I'll... I'll do it.

53:22.082 --> 53:23.501
I'll be gentle.

53:29.298 --> 53:31.300
Don't be gentle.

53:32.092 --> 53:33.594
Like that?

53:34.595 --> 53:36.096
Yeah.

53:46.106 --> 53:49.026
- Oh, whoa! What the fuck?
- It's bourbon.

53:49.109 --> 53:52.112
- I...
- That's all. It's just bourbon.

53:52.196 --> 53:54.448
- Take it.
- I really don't want to.

53:54.532 --> 53:57.117
Nothing's going through the skin.

53:57.201 --> 53:59.620
I just want you to squirt it...

53:59.703 --> 54:01.330
into my mouth.

54:02.540 --> 54:05.084
Okay? Please.

54:16.345 --> 54:18.305
- Is that our target?
- Yes, sir.

54:18.389 --> 54:21.350
Mr. President,
this is a highly classified operation...

54:21.433 --> 54:24.019
I'm clearing the First Lady
for this operation.

54:24.103 --> 54:25.729
Yes, sir. Forgive me, sir.

54:25.813 --> 54:27.690
We are armed and ready, sir.

54:27.773 --> 54:31.193
Abdullah is in one of those
vehicles. We can't tell which one.

54:31.277 --> 54:32.945
If they go in
three different directions,

54:33.028 --> 54:36.282
we wouldn't know where to strike, and
if he makes it back to the mountains,

54:36.365 --> 54:38.075
we'll lose our satellite track on him.

54:39.451 --> 54:41.078
Are those children?

54:41.161 --> 54:43.497
I can't say definitely, sir,
but they could be.

54:45.833 --> 54:47.376
Do we have authorization, sir?

54:50.045 --> 54:53.090
- Proceed.
- Proceed with the launch.

54:55.467 --> 54:57.261
And ten seconds.

54:59.013 --> 55:04.018
And five, four, three...

55:14.028 --> 55:16.280
Target is destroyed, sir.

55:18.782 --> 55:20.618
Thank you, everyone.

55:43.182 --> 55:44.934
I still want it.

55:47.978 --> 55:49.396
All right.

55:52.775 --> 55:54.485
All right.
