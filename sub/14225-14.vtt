- Yeah, I'll pass.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)

05:11.022 --> 05:12.269
I'm telling you,

05:12.270 --> 05:13.688
a UFO crashed

05:13.689 --> 05:15.105
in the lake last night,

05:15.106 --> 05:16.713
and there's a naked alien

05:16.714 --> 05:18.317
running around in the woods.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.027
Why would it be naked?

05:20.028 --> 05:21.570
Aliens don't need clothes,

05:21.571 --> 05:22.823
because they have

05:22.824 --> 05:24.073
a thick exoskeleton.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.034
- Plus, they're very free
- with their bodies.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.954
I'm still not convinced

05:28.955 --> 05:30.079
that was a UFO.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.666
Maybe if we can get

05:31.667 --> 05:33.249
some more evidence.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.939
Ooh! There's still

05:34.940 --> 05:36.628
some alien goo

05:33.250 --> 05:36.627
on Zuri's sandal.

05:36.628 --> 05:37.922
You can test it with your

05:37.923 --> 05:39.214
looky-closey-thingy.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.758
You mean my microscope?

05:43.134 --> 05:45.386
And this is the fire pit.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.638
We hang out here

05:46.639 --> 05:47.889
and make s'mores

05:45.387 --> 05:47.888
every night.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.849
- Maybe tonight I can
- sit next to you?

05:49.852 --> 05:51.851
Sure. That would be

- Who I've never
- met in my life.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.814
She's a kidder.

06:16.815 --> 06:18.335
We're her best friends.

I'm Jorge. This is Tiffany.

Interesting.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.681
And when did you get here?

06:30.682 --> 06:31.954
Oh, I just flew in

06:31.955 --> 06:33.226
last night.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.226
Huh.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.687
Um, it was a rough landing.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.398
Right, right.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.107
Can I touch your skin?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.234
Yeah, I'm thinking no?

06:42.819 --> 06:44.194
Good decision.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.426
I haven't seen Jorge

06:45.427 --> 06:46.655

- I'm never thinking
- what you're thinking.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.540

06:56.916 --> 06:58.835
- Marsh shows up
- out of nowhere.

06:58.838 --> 07:00.316
He had a rough landing

07:00.317 --> 07:01.795

07:01.796 --> 07:03.173
He must be the alien

07:03.174 --> 07:04.548
that crashed in the lake.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.384
That's ridiculous.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.219
Why would an alien

07:04.549 --> 07:08.218
take human form?

07:08.219 --> 07:10.179
Because that's how they roll!

07:10.180 --> 07:12.140
- Haven't you ever seen
- a sci-fi movie?

07:12.143 --> 07:13.392
No. Mom says

07:13.393 --> 07:14.642
I'm not allowed

07:14.643 --> 07:15.644
to see a movie

07:15.645 --> 07:16.645
about another planet

07:16.646 --> 07:17.959
until I discover

07:17.960 --> 07:19.272
another planet.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.528
Well, CITs, your counselors

07:24.529 --> 07:26.320

07:44.173 --> 07:45.881
I know how you feel.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.424
(SNORTS) Who am I kidding?

07:47.425 --> 07:48.761
I do not. I always get

07:48.762 --> 07:50.095
perfect grades.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.596
(SCOFFS) Until now.

What? Xander wrote,

07:54.851 --> 07:57.102
"CIT has not embraced nature."

07:57.936 --> 07:59.353
That is ridiculous.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.272
- I have been out in the woods
- many times.

08:01.275 --> 08:02.545
(SCOFFS) Yeah, and last time,

08:02.546 --> 08:03.816
you were sprayed by a skunk,

08:03.817 --> 08:05.923
got poison ivy, and had to be

08:05.924 --> 08:08.029
carried back to camp

08:03.817 --> 08:08.028
by two 6-year-olds.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.198
They were eight!

08:09.199 --> 08:10.365
And surprisingly beefy!

08:14.035 --> 08:16.036
The aliens abducted me once.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.414
Now, Marsh is here

08:17.415 --> 08:18.789
to take me back.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.542
So I'm supposed to believe

08:20.543 --> 08:22.292
aliens took you,

08:22.293 --> 08:24.254
- and then after spending
- time with you,

08:24.257 --> 08:25.922
Actually want you back?

08:27.340 --> 08:29.093
Yes! I'm a very

08:29.094 --> 08:30.843
desirable specimen!

08:30.844 --> 08:32.011
Of what?

08:33.429 --> 08:36.597
Have you seen my hair?

08:36.599 --> 08:38.059
I knew I should have brought

08:38.061 --> 08:39.518
my anti-probing pants.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.020
They're just so heavy.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.942
Well, if you're so sure

08:44.943 --> 08:46.985
Marsh is an alien,

08:42.897 --> 08:46.985
just avoid him.

08:50.447 --> 08:51.864
Hey, buddy.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.199
Hey, you.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.784
What are you doing here?

08:55.785 --> 08:57.306
- (WHISPERING)
- Don't let him take me.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.040
I'm your new roomie.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.584
- I'm going to have - a lot of fun with you.
- (WHIMPERS)

09:02.587 --> 09:04.419
By the way, cool hair.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.923
(CRYING) He's after my hair.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.469
(WHIRRING)

09:13.470 --> 09:15.097
Wait, that's the same

09:15.098 --> 09:16.722
sound sequence

09:16.723 --> 09:18.224
SETI sends into outer space.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.476
SETI stands for...

09:20.477 --> 09:22.187
Search for Extra-Terrestrial

09:22.188 --> 09:23.896
Intelligence.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.732
- What? Just because
- I'm handsome,

09:25.735 --> 09:26.900
I can't be smart?

09:28.526 --> 09:31.278
Maybe Marsh is an alien.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.280
And he's sending an

09:32.281 --> 09:33.281
intergalactic text

09:34.115 --> 09:36.158
to his alien buddies!

09:36.159 --> 09:37.368
They're coming to get me!

09:40.288 --> 09:41.956
- And you without
- your probing pants.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.963
Nice shot. (CHUCKLES)

09:49.964 --> 09:51.279
Okay, either you're

09:51.280 --> 09:52.591
letting me win on purpose,

09:52.592 --> 09:54.718
or you stink at pool.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.471
- Let's go with the
- "on purpose" thing.

09:56.474 --> 09:57.930
(CHUCKLES)

09:57.931 --> 09:59.556
JORGE: Ah.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.017
Okay, this isn't working.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.270
I can't believe I'm

10:03.271 --> 10:04.436
living with an alien.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.356
He's gonna dissect my brain!

10:08.024 --> 10:10.317
He'll have to find it first.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.633
Well, all this losing

10:11.634 --> 10:12.945
is kind of making me thirsty.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.488
Want an ice cream float?

10:14.489 --> 10:15.991
Eh, you won't like

10:15.992 --> 10:17.491
what's floating in there.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.452
- We're better off with
- something bottled.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.453
Coming right up.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.460
Zuri, there's something

10:26.461 --> 10:27.835
you need to know.

10:27.836 --> 10:28.962
Marsh is not

10:28.963 --> 10:30.087
from this planet!

10:30.088 --> 10:32.028
You're telling me.

10:32.029 --> 10:33.966
He's out of this world.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.448
Uh, literally.

10:35.449 --> 10:36.927
He's an alien.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.325
It was his UFO

10:38.326 --> 10:39.721
that landed in the lake.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.350
Jorge, a UFO

10:41.351 --> 10:42.975
did not crash here.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.186
But if it did,

10:44.187 --> 10:45.395
and the aliens

10:42.976 --> 10:45.394
look like Marsh,

10:45.395 --> 10:46.937
then take me to his leader.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.481
- (CHUCKLES)
- What?

10:50.441 --> 10:52.360
- Zuri's never going
- to believe us.

10:52.363 --> 10:53.695
We need some DNA,

10:53.696 --> 10:55.029
like a hair sample,

10:52.360 --> 10:55.029
so I can test it.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.281
Okay.

10:57.282 --> 11:00.450
Not yours. His!

11:00.451 --> 11:02.475
Great. That was a waste

11:02.476 --> 11:04.496
of a perfect strand of hair.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.416
Unless you want to use this

11:06.417 --> 11:08.333
to make a clone of me?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.003
No, thanks. One is too much.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.674
And that, my little saplings,

11:14.675 --> 11:16.174
is the art of beading.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.365
Any questions?

11:17.366 --> 11:18.552
Yeah, I have a question.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.262
How could you do this to me?

11:20.263 --> 11:22.473
Excuse me. Craft away.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.728
I take it you're peeved

11:25.729 --> 11:27.019
about my evaluation.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.271
Don't take it personally.

11:28.272 --> 11:29.521
I'm just a tough evaluator.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.607
Yeah, I got that.

11:31.608 --> 11:32.901
"CIT Ross refuses to

11:32.902 --> 11:34.192
adhere to schedule."

11:34.193 --> 11:35.861
What does that even mean?

11:35.862 --> 11:37.176
Last week,

11:37.177 --> 11:38.489
you were supposed to

11:35.862 --> 11:38.488
take the campers kayaking,

11:38.489 --> 11:39.908
and instead you decided to

11:39.909 --> 11:41.325
host a French braiding circle.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.869
- Well, I wasn't going
- to have them

11:42.872 --> 11:44.787
- Go out on the lake
- looking like savages.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.541
- You also wrote that I
- am "often tardy."

11:48.544 --> 11:50.459
I am very punctual.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.961
- You were scheduled
- to lead this

11:51.964 --> 11:53.838
- Arts and Crafts class
- fifteen minutes ago.

11:53.841 --> 11:55.088
I hit traffic.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.112
The great lawn

11:56.113 --> 11:57.133
is extremely congested.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.472
- I thought we
- were best friends.

12:02.475 --> 12:03.848
We are best friends,

12:03.849 --> 12:05.223
but I'm also your boss.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.642
So I have to wear two hats.

12:06.643 --> 12:07.726
My boss hat.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.353
And my bestie hat.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.939
Right now, I'm rocking

12:10.940 --> 12:12.523
my boss hat, like a boss.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.131
Well, I think your bestie hat

12:16.132 --> 12:17.694
is much more flattering.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.072
- You're still supposed to
- lead this class!

12:19.073 --> 12:20.073
- I know!
- Yep.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.598
And that brings us

12:23.599 --> 12:24.618
to calculus four,

12:24.619 --> 12:25.954
where I got

12:25.955 --> 12:27.287
yet another A-plus.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.103
Or as my teachers call it,

12:29.104 --> 12:30.916
a Ravi-plus.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.836
Dude, I spaced out

12:32.837 --> 12:34.754
like 10 minutes ago.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.754
Intentionally.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.255
What I am trying to say is,

12:37.256 --> 12:38.300
that poor evaluation

12:38.301 --> 12:39.341
you gave me

12:39.342 --> 12:40.365
will tarnish

12:40.366 --> 12:41.385
my flawless record,

12:41.386 --> 12:42.534
and I will never

12:42.535 --> 12:43.679
get into MIT.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.138
Mitch's Incredible Tacos?

12:45.139 --> 12:47.058
- Dude, I know Mitch,
- I can get you in.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.625
MIT is a college,

12:50.626 --> 12:52.354
and they look at everything.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.481
My record must be perfect.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.817
Look, bro, nobody's perfect.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.570
I am. Academically, anyway.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.137
And I will prove to you that

13:03.138 --> 13:04.783
I am an excellent outdoorsman.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.161
I'm going for a jaunt

13:06.162 --> 13:07.536
in the forest right now.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.080
But first, I must apply

13:09.081 --> 13:10.622
a skosh of bug spray.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.957
(SCREAMS)

13:11.958 --> 13:14.210
Mother of nature, that burns!

13:18.297 --> 13:19.618
- Hey, guys.
- Can we talk to you?

13:21.551 --> 13:23.051
Guess you're still mad.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.178
Time to bust

13:24.179 --> 13:25.303
out my bestie hat.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.973
It's a fedora, by the way.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.518
Emma, I know

13:29.519 --> 13:30.559
my evaluation upset you.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.437
- And Ravi, I know
- you're disappointed

13:32.440 --> 13:33.938
- You didn't get
- a perfect score.

13:33.941 --> 13:35.565
- We get that it's hard
- to be criticized.

13:35.568 --> 13:37.567
- Look, we know we're
- not perfect either.

13:37.570 --> 13:38.943
- So why don't you guys
- tell us

13:38.946 --> 13:40.820
- What we can work on
- as counselors.

13:40.823 --> 13:41.905
Okay. Sometimes

13:41.906 --> 13:42.988
you can be bossy.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.032
Take that back!

13:46.034 --> 13:47.285
I mean, if you want to.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.601
And you are obsessed

13:50.602 --> 13:51.830
with your schedules.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.832
I mean, you laminate them

13:52.833 --> 13:53.833
before you go to bed.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.230
Well, excuse me for taking

13:55.231 --> 13:56.626
pride in my work.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.025
And by the way,

13:58.026 --> 13:59.422
everybody loves

13:56.627 --> 13:59.421
my schedules.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.340
- Not the We-Hate-Lou's-
- Schedules Club.

14:01.343 --> 14:02.967
- It's a tiny organization,
- but active.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.180
I have been to one

14:06.181 --> 14:07.472
of their mixers.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.472
Great cookies.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.640
Guys, lay off.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.164
If Lou wants to make

14:12.165 --> 14:13.685
rigid, un-fun schedules,

14:13.686 --> 14:15.166
- then that's her
- counselor journey.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.232
Oh, Xander.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.673
Always so concerned

14:20.674 --> 14:22.110
with being Mr. Cool,

14:22.111 --> 14:23.217
letting the campers

14:23.218 --> 14:24.321
run amok.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.470
Gotta let the kids be

14:25.471 --> 14:26.615
who they be.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.284
- I just want them to have
- a good time.

14:28.287 --> 14:29.515
Oh, um, and speaking

14:29.516 --> 14:30.744
of a good time,

14:30.745 --> 14:32.247
your "good time" camp songs

14:32.248 --> 14:33.748
are a little one note.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.792
You are so wrong.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.794
I know at least three notes.

14:38.795 --> 14:39.795
I'll show you.

14:41.756 --> 14:42.756
This is a G.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.051
This is an A.

14:45.843 --> 14:49.305
C! Wait, that's a G again.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.141
Ravi, apologize to Xander.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.103
- His music is the soundtrack
- to our summer.

14:55.106 --> 14:56.603
(SCOFFS)

14:56.604 --> 14:58.648
- Don't tell Ravi what to do,
- Miss Bossy Hat!

15:01.734 --> 15:03.402
Oh, it's on.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.238
(YELPS)

15:07.532 --> 15:09.741
Hey, my guitar!

15:09.742 --> 15:10.993
(SHRIEKS)

15:14.747 --> 15:16.248
(GASPS)

15:16.249 --> 15:17.959
Hey! For the last time,

15:17.960 --> 15:19.668
if you splash me with water,

15:19.669 --> 15:20.962
I won't melt!

15:22.588 --> 15:24.589
Now explain yourselves!

15:24.590 --> 15:27.008
(ALL CLAMORING)

15:27.009 --> 15:28.887
I don't care who said,

15:28.888 --> 15:30.762
she said, what said!

15:30.763 --> 15:32.889
As counselors and CITs,

15:32.890 --> 15:34.246
it's your job to get along

15:34.247 --> 15:35.600
and work together!

15:35.601 --> 15:36.728
Sorry, Gladys.

15:36.729 --> 15:37.853
We'll work on that.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.126
Starting now,

15:39.127 --> 15:40.397
for the rest of the day,

15:40.398 --> 15:41.524
you're going to be doing

15:41.525 --> 15:42.649
team building exercises.

15:42.650 --> 15:43.817
Oh, I didn't mean right now.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.653
- I've got popcorn
- in the microwave.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.406
Which will keep till later.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.825
- It just won't be
- freshly popped.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.830
So, did you get

15:54.831 --> 15:55.996
the alien DNA sample?

15:55.997 --> 15:57.874
No. It's like Marsh has eyes

15:57.875 --> 15:59.749
in the back of his head.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.856
Maybe he does have eyes

16:00.857 --> 16:01.961
in the back of his head!

16:03.671 --> 16:05.089
Lucky. He can read

16:05.090 --> 16:06.507
two books at once!

16:07.800 --> 16:08.990
Speaking of books,

16:08.991 --> 16:10.178
look what I found

16:07.800 --> 16:10.178
in his bag.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.764
Diagrams of spaceships!

16:14.765 --> 16:16.330
Weird. And I don't

16:16.331 --> 16:17.893
recognize this language.

16:17.894 --> 16:18.916
Probably because

16:18.917 --> 16:19.937
it's Alien-ese!

16:20.688 --> 16:22.190
We have to warn Zuri.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.360
Zuri, we need to...

16:25.361 --> 16:26.943
Hey, guys!

16:26.944 --> 16:28.300
Don't you just love it

16:28.301 --> 16:29.654
here at camp?

16:29.655 --> 16:31.157
Two weeks ago you tried to

16:31.158 --> 16:32.658
mail yourself home.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.161
Well, good thing

16:35.162 --> 16:36.411
I couldn't fit in the box,

16:36.412 --> 16:38.144
because then I never

16:38.145 --> 16:39.873
would've met Marsh.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.583
Zuri, I know you're feeling

16:41.584 --> 16:43.461
- butterflies in your
- stomach right now,

16:43.464 --> 16:44.629
But kill them!

16:46.130 --> 16:47.881
And listen to us.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.384
Marsh really is an alien,

16:49.385 --> 16:50.884
and we have proof.

16:50.885 --> 16:54.555
Wow. He has great penmanship.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.432
Snap out of it.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.059
Marsh is a Martian.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.770
It's right there in his name!

17:01.938 --> 17:04.021
Guys, this is crazy!

17:04.022 --> 17:05.400
Marsh is not...

17:05.401 --> 17:06.775
Is not what?

17:06.776 --> 17:09.028
Is not late for our hangout.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.530
Wait, where are you going?

17:11.531 --> 17:12.696
It's a surprise.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.199
I'm taking her away.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.326
And not fast enough.

17:15.327 --> 17:16.452
Let's go.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.038
Did you hear that?

17:20.039 --> 17:21.395
He's going to take

17:21.396 --> 17:22.749
her away to his home planet!

17:22.750 --> 17:24.291
That's horrible.

17:24.292 --> 17:25.587
And quite frankly,

17:25.588 --> 17:26.877
a little insulting.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.256
He could have had all this.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.887
This is so nice.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.265
I don't even mind

17:37.266 --> 17:38.641
the rank stank

17:35.888 --> 17:38.640
from the lake.

17:38.641 --> 17:39.725
Ooh, I almost forgot.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.726
For the smell.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.439
You thought of everything.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.774
Now!

17:47.775 --> 17:49.569
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

17:49.572 --> 17:50.902
Saving your life.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.070
You can thank us later

17:52.071 --> 17:53.447
- with a basket
- of mini muffins.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.057
Emma and Ravi, you must

17:59.058 --> 18:00.745
now push your counselors

18:00.746 --> 18:02.332
through an obstacle course,

18:02.333 --> 18:03.915
while blindfolded.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.523
Why blindfolds? To show

18:05.524 --> 18:07.127
we can trust each other?

18:07.128 --> 18:08.714
That, and if you fall,

18:08.715 --> 18:10.298
it'll be super-funny.

18:07.128 --> 18:10.297
(CHUCKLES)

18:10.298 --> 18:11.508
Now, prove to me

18:11.509 --> 18:12.716
you can work together,

18:12.717 --> 18:14.198
or I might be looking for

18:14.199 --> 18:15.677
new counselors for next year.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.429
(CHUCKLES) Go!

18:17.430 --> 18:18.847
(ALL EXHALING)

18:18.848 --> 18:20.558
- Move right! - Uh, my right
- Or your right?

18:20.561 --> 18:22.143
We have the same right!

18:24.103 --> 18:25.543
Chill, bro. I said chill!

18:25.544 --> 18:26.980
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

18:26.981 --> 18:28.691
(ALL GROAN)

18:30.109 --> 18:32.133
Look at you. A big pile

18:32.134 --> 18:34.154
of limbs and failure!

18:34.155 --> 18:35.636
I think it's time to look

18:35.637 --> 18:37.115
for some new counselors.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.575
But I love this job.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.411
- I get paid to hang out
- with my girlfriend

18:40.414 --> 18:42.162
And toast marshmallows.

18:42.163 --> 18:43.519
And if I can't work here,

18:43.520 --> 18:44.874
I'll have to take

18:42.163 --> 18:44.873
that rotten job

18:44.874 --> 18:46.251
as a bouncer

18:46.252 --> 18:47.626
at the dairy expo.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.941
You'd be shocked how rowdy

18:48.942 --> 18:50.254
folks get when they're

18:47.627 --> 18:50.254
hopped up on milk.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.799
- We're sorry we got you
- guys into this.

18:53.802 --> 18:55.259
- We don't want you
- to lose your jobs.

18:55.262 --> 18:56.949
True. Xander, you can be

18:56.950 --> 18:58.637
a tad loosey-goosey,

18:58.638 --> 19:00.431
- but that is only because
- you want everyone

19:00.434 --> 19:02.016
- To have a great
- camp experience.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.481
- And Lou,
- that wouldn't happen

19:08.484 --> 19:10.066
- Without your perfectly
- scheduled fun.

19:10.069 --> 19:11.192
You may be bossy,

19:11.193 --> 19:12.317
but you're passionate.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.924
Aw, you guys sure know

19:13.925 --> 19:15.529
how to string words

19:12.318 --> 19:15.528
together real nice.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.696
(EXHALES)

19:16.697 --> 19:18.156
All this sappy yapping

19:18.157 --> 19:19.554
isn't going to complete

19:19.555 --> 19:20.950
the exercise.

19:20.951 --> 19:21.974
Come on, guys.

19:21.975 --> 19:22.995
Let's finish this!

19:24.288 --> 19:25.830
All right, here we go.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.712
- LOU: Okay, not there.
- EMMA: Okay. All right.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.420
- Okay, Emma, there's
- a cone on your left.

19:31.423 --> 19:32.963
- So, in the least
- bossy way possible,

19:32.966 --> 19:34.340
I suggest you go right.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.466
Ravi, you're good.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.010
Go forth, my man!

19:39.845 --> 19:41.205
- Hey, hey! We did it!
- (CHUCKLES)

19:42.848 --> 19:43.912
Hmm, we were

19:43.913 --> 19:44.975
a lot closer

19:42.848 --> 19:44.974
than I thought.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.102
Yes. That was

19:46.103 --> 19:47.228
quite anticlimactic.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.314
Yeah, like most things

19:50.315 --> 19:51.731
in my life.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.401
Now, clean this up!

19:54.402 --> 19:56.592
Emma, I'm really sorry

19:56.593 --> 19:58.781
you were disappointed

19:54.402 --> 19:58.780
with your evaluation,

19:58.781 --> 20:00.073
but you should know

20:00.074 --> 20:01.471
that was the best one

20:01.472 --> 20:02.867
I ever gave.

20:02.868 --> 20:06.037
Really? Well, thank you.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.248
And right now,

20:07.249 --> 20:08.457
you are rocking

20:06.038 --> 20:08.456
that bestie fedora.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.208
(BOTH GIGGLE)

20:10.209 --> 20:11.711
And Ravi, I promise,

20:11.712 --> 20:13.211
by the time summer's over,

20:13.212 --> 20:15.089
- I'm going to help you
- embrace nature,

20:15.092 --> 20:17.092
- Like Gladys embraces
- her Brad Pitt body pillow.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.428
Thank you.

20:20.429 --> 20:21.636
And the truth is,

20:21.637 --> 20:22.929
I do like your songs.

20:22.930 --> 20:23.973
I actually sing them

20:23.974 --> 20:25.014
in the shower

20:25.015 --> 20:26.976
- with choreographed dance
- routines. (CHUCKLES)

20:28.519 --> 20:29.729
(CHUCKLES)

20:29.730 --> 20:30.938
I have said too much.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.339
Okay, dirtbag,

20:36.340 --> 20:37.610
when you arrived,

20:37.611 --> 20:39.196
- you said you had
- a "rough landing."

20:39.199 --> 20:41.052
Which is code for

20:41.053 --> 20:42.908
"you crashed your

20:39.196 --> 20:42.907
spaceship in the lake."

20:42.908 --> 20:43.952
And that's how you

20:43.953 --> 20:44.993
hurt your arm.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.703
Right, alien scum?

20:46.704 --> 20:47.872
Now, that's just rude.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.834
I meant I had a rough

20:51.835 --> 20:53.668
landing at the airport.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.795
An overhead bin popped open,

20:55.796 --> 20:57.152
and a suitcase

20:57.153 --> 20:58.506
fell on my arm.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.176
Okay, asteroid breath,

21:01.177 --> 21:03.095
- explain the weird
- light and noise

21:03.098 --> 21:04.888
Coming from the bathroom.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.681
That's my teeth whitener.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.442
- It's on the sink if you
- don't believe me.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.125
I'd say they're usually

21:11.126 --> 21:12.270
not this bad,

21:12.271 --> 21:13.773
but I'd be lying.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.526
I've never seen one of these.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.863
It's a dental

21:19.864 --> 21:21.196
hygiene device.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.823
- No wonder you don't
- recognize it.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.867
And what about this?

21:25.868 --> 21:27.703
- Explain the diagrams
- of spaceships

21:27.706 --> 21:29.587
- And the notes written
- in your native tongue.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.708
I'm working on

21:31.709 --> 21:32.791
a sci-fi novel!

21:32.792 --> 21:34.418
- So I made up
- my own alien language.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.086
Squeakel borp lurg nitz!

21:37.087 --> 21:38.298
If you weren't so cute,

21:38.299 --> 21:39.507
I'd shove you in a locker.

21:41.342 --> 21:42.802
But you said you were

21:42.803 --> 21:44.260
going to take Zuri away.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.304
Not to another planet!

21:46.305 --> 21:48.106
- I was just gonna take her
- on a canoe ride.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.101
- Oh.
- That makes sense.

21:52.812 --> 21:53.855
So you're really

21:53.856 --> 21:54.896
not an alien?

21:54.897 --> 21:56.606
No.

21:56.607 --> 21:57.879
Uh, would you believe

21:57.880 --> 21:59.150
we were doing a play?

21:59.151 --> 22:00.611
No.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.154
You guys are nuts!

22:03.155 --> 22:04.887
I'm telling my mom

22:04.888 --> 22:06.617
I want to go to that

22:03.155 --> 22:06.616
cooking camp instead.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.118
Zuri, you have my digits.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.247
So he cooks, too?

22:12.248 --> 22:13.791
Wow, you're a lucky girl.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.001
Oh, right.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.527
Zuri, we're really

22:20.528 --> 22:22.090
sorry about Marsh.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.259
We didn't mean to

22:23.260 --> 22:24.425
scare him away.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.678
Well, technically we did,

22:26.679 --> 22:27.847
but that was

22:27.848 --> 22:29.014
when we thought

22:26.679 --> 22:29.013
he was an alien.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.015
We just wanted

22:30.016 --> 22:31.016
to protect you.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.123
Maybe next time

22:33.124 --> 22:35.229
you could protect me

22:31.016 --> 22:35.228
from Todd in Eagle Cabin.

22:35.229 --> 22:36.439
He leaves dead bugs

22:36.440 --> 22:37.647
on my pillow.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.024
Ooh, I think he's flirting.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.988
- I still don't understand
- what that metal was

22:43.991 --> 22:45.363
That we found in the lake.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.887
Or where that

22:46.888 --> 22:48.408
blue goo came from.

22:48.409 --> 22:49.806
Hey, kids. It's safe

22:49.807 --> 22:51.202
to swim in the lake again.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.204
You never told us

22:52.205 --> 22:53.205
it wasn't safe.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.083
What, like that's my job?

22:57.585 --> 22:58.774
Look, a boat engine

22:58.775 --> 22:59.961
blew the other day.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.067
There was metal

23:01.068 --> 23:02.171
and blue fluid everywhere.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.841
- But it's cleaned up,
- and now

23:03.844 --> 23:04.863
The lake is

23:04.864 --> 23:05.884
only mildly toxic.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.387
So much for your alien.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.805
You can blame these two

23:10.806 --> 23:12.725
- for scaring away
- your new camper.

23:12.728 --> 23:14.058
What are you talking about?

23:14.059 --> 23:16.185
There wasn't any new camper.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.855
You guys are annoying enough.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.028
So maybe Marsh

23:23.029 --> 23:24.611
was an alien?

23:24.612 --> 23:26.051
If he was, I kind of wish

23:26.052 --> 23:27.489
he'd taken me.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.701
- Something tells me,
- I'd fit in

23:30.704 --> 23:32.327
A lot better up there.

23:32.328 --> 23:33.537
Couldn't fit in worse.
