00:00.001 --> 00:00.865
- _
- Golding tried to leave the country.

00:00.923 --> 00:02.031
Border controls kicked in.

00:02.072 --> 00:04.771
They should have taken him, but there
was a backup car and he got away.

00:04.795 --> 00:07.120
I heard you stopped mid-sentence
like you'd seen a ghost,

00:07.155 --> 00:09.781
- and then you just ran out.
- I thought I saw Golding.

00:09.839 --> 00:12.354
One day, Harry's luck is going to run out.

00:12.405 --> 00:14.098
If you spent more time
thinking about your work

00:14.122 --> 00:15.994
and less about Harry,
you'd get better results.

00:16.029 --> 00:17.842
You and I are different. We can step

00:17.877 --> 00:20.039
out into this night,
and anything can happen.

00:20.110 --> 00:22.948
No one's luck lasts
forever. Get down from there.

00:22.983 --> 00:24.543
Isabella?

00:25.925 --> 00:27.365
We're invincible.

00:27.435 --> 00:29.510
All you've done is lie, Eve.

00:29.586 --> 00:31.647
Does he know you've put this on my wrist?

00:31.694 --> 00:34.895
How are you filling the
God-shaped hole in your soul?

00:34.961 --> 00:37.055
The awful Huxley.

00:37.108 --> 00:39.729
Sometimes there's no justice.

00:39.764 --> 00:41.888
I think you'd be surprised.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.984 --> 01:56.061
Phone.

02:13.068 --> 02:14.258
Finally.

02:24.150 --> 02:27.908
You know, I almost got away.
Lots of times, actually.

02:28.380 --> 02:32.039
Bribed the Port Authority
Â£15,000 to look the other way,

02:32.152 --> 02:36.123
only for all the crossings to be
cancelled due to a freak storm.

02:36.209 --> 02:38.498
Keeps happening, every time.

02:39.101 --> 02:44.306
Made me realise... the
bracelet doesn't want me to go!

02:44.371 --> 02:48.813
It won't let me. Fair
enough. I won't try anymore.

02:49.890 --> 02:51.440
Time for something new.

04:00.325 --> 04:05.130
- It's not a bad entrance.
- Try it. I dare you.

04:05.209 --> 04:06.714
I rather like this suit.

04:06.777 --> 04:08.630
It's just a bet. Where's the harm?

04:08.692 --> 04:11.619
I think we both know the answer to that.

04:11.704 --> 04:15.809
- If you want to learn, play the game.
- I've done that before.

04:15.865 --> 04:18.254
- And?
- I made my family homeless.

04:18.334 --> 04:21.886
Well, if you'd won, they'd
be living in a palace.

04:24.470 --> 04:28.330
Your risks are what make you great, Harry.

04:28.392 --> 04:29.978
All right, Dr. Freud.

04:30.331 --> 04:31.637
It's just water.

04:33.808 --> 04:40.531
You are very bad news.

05:15.228 --> 05:16.397
Harry?

05:18.771 --> 05:19.771
Hi.

05:27.888 --> 05:32.650
Sorry, sorry. Sorry,
but what are the chances?

05:32.685 --> 05:36.336
Not just you seeing Harry just as
he's about to do something so...

05:36.385 --> 05:37.574
Stupid?

05:37.643 --> 05:42.057
Interesting. But also you
being in such handsome company.

05:42.750 --> 05:46.078
You know, I was actually quite
nervous about meeting you, Harry.

05:46.165 --> 05:48.998
But I suppose this has broken the ice?

05:49.033 --> 05:51.991
- I'm amazed they let you in like that.
- Giovanni won't mind.

05:52.047 --> 05:55.408
- Giovanni, the owner?
- He's a friend. I get around.

05:55.464 --> 05:56.850
I'm sure you do.

05:57.615 --> 06:00.827
- So, how long have you two been together?
- We're not together.

06:00.914 --> 06:05.650
Not yet. He's so old-fashioned,
keeping me on tenterhooks.

06:05.696 --> 06:07.090
Someone please shoot me in the head.

06:07.114 --> 06:09.443
I bet you didn't have
to wait, did you, Anna?

06:09.509 --> 06:11.928
I'll have that gun when
you're finished with it.

06:11.990 --> 06:16.888
So, how did you meet? Was
it fantastically romantic?

06:16.946 --> 06:20.622
Hardly. We work together.
But I've always admired her.

06:20.685 --> 06:24.410
You know, how she sees a case. How
she holds all the facts in her head.

06:24.473 --> 06:26.101
And then she knows how
to present them to a jury

06:26.125 --> 06:29.246
so that they see the story
just as she wants them to.

06:29.281 --> 06:32.252
It's... It's really sexy.

06:33.770 --> 06:35.111
Shit, sorry.

06:36.163 --> 06:39.342
Look, can we just order some
bloody food? I'm starving.

06:39.389 --> 06:41.535
How did you two meet?

06:41.570 --> 06:42.641
Um, I was...

06:42.676 --> 06:47.219
Yes, hello? What, now? OK.

06:47.254 --> 06:48.259
Really?

06:48.294 --> 06:50.250
- I'm sorry, it's my job.
- You haven't eaten.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.580
Great to meet you, Harry.

06:51.666 --> 06:55.274
- Hopefully next time we'll, um...
- Yeah.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.390
- Hello.
- Victim's name's

07:04.453 --> 07:08.081
Anthony Johnstone, 39 years
old, died last Tuesday.

07:08.174 --> 07:10.731
Is there a bin anywhere?
I can't go in with this.

07:10.766 --> 07:12.595
Just scoff it down!

07:12.649 --> 07:14.144
No time to iron?

07:14.208 --> 07:17.312
- So, Anthony...?
- Johnstone. PM was last night.

07:17.378 --> 07:20.680
- Turns out he was killed by a blood clot.
- That's natural causes.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.972
Something strange turned up
in the contents of his stomach.

07:22.996 --> 07:23.676
What?

07:23.733 --> 07:25.614
- Human flesh.
- Human?

07:25.649 --> 07:27.903
So we may have a cannibal on our hands.

07:28.145 --> 07:29.728
How's that kebab going down?

07:36.762 --> 07:39.650
No, not a cannibal. Not in my opinion.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.560
What about the stomach contents?

07:41.595 --> 07:45.199
Well, this fingernail made
me suspicious, so I did

07:45.277 --> 07:49.770
a precipitate test which confirmed
the meat is definitely human,

07:50.023 --> 07:56.538
but there's also pork with
apple and onion, sage...

07:56.644 --> 07:57.810
All right, Ralph. What?

07:57.869 --> 07:59.909
I don't think Mr. Johnstone
knew what he was eating.

07:59.987 --> 08:01.468
Did you say sage?

08:01.537 --> 08:02.730
Pastry.

08:04.753 --> 08:08.057
If Mr. Johnstone here had
died of more obvious causes,

08:08.127 --> 08:09.494
then we'd never have known.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.097
Indeed, he may have done
it before, many times.

08:12.169 --> 08:13.651
I'm sorry, done what?

08:13.752 --> 08:15.199
Eaten a pie.

08:20.673 --> 08:23.637
Thank you. I'll get you...

08:23.689 --> 08:24.928
Two pence.

08:28.103 --> 08:31.553
Human remains? Well, we'd never...

08:31.625 --> 08:35.563
Mr. Johnstone's wife said he visited
your stall most days. This is him.

08:36.059 --> 08:39.126
Yeah. Big fan of the pork and sage.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.160
A bit snooty about the
lamb and beetroot, though.

08:41.205 --> 08:43.264
Not an adventurous type, you know?

08:45.240 --> 08:47.667
- You think I did it.
- You made the pies yourself?

08:47.736 --> 08:50.120
W-What kind of sick
pervert do your think I am?

08:50.155 --> 08:51.860
The only thing I add to these pies is love.

08:51.884 --> 08:53.232
Where do you get your meat?

08:53.267 --> 08:56.232
Not some common supermarket,
thank you very much.

08:56.315 --> 09:00.560
- I put my heart into each and every pie.
- So, where do you get your meat?

09:00.625 --> 09:04.110
- Smithfield Market, of course.
- Which butcher, which stall?

09:04.145 --> 09:07.950
I don't have a regular supplier.
I like to sniff out a bargain.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.630
I'm ruined. Human meat in my pies?

09:12.740 --> 09:16.381
Well, it can't be her. She doesn't
look like a Mrs. Lovett, does she?

09:16.451 --> 09:19.989
- A who?
- You know. Sweeney Todd, the musical?

09:20.074 --> 09:21.704
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

09:21.759 --> 09:23.770
You sing a bit. I'll see if I remember.

09:23.832 --> 09:26.948
- If you think I'm falling for that...
- Harry. Suri.

09:28.305 --> 09:30.844
A neighbour heard screams
in the street last night.

09:30.908 --> 09:33.360
Further investigation led to this.

09:34.454 --> 09:36.094
We haven't ID'd the woman yet.

09:42.785 --> 09:44.523
She looks familiar.

09:44.593 --> 09:48.435
Now, the plates are false,
obviously, but then we found this.

09:48.470 --> 09:49.734
We managed to clean up the image.

09:49.758 --> 09:52.077
You don't see anything until
he turns around and it's only

09:52.120 --> 09:53.829
for a split second.

09:56.250 --> 10:00.280
- My God.
- Golding. That's Golding.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.177
- No.
- Get a squad car to Anna's chambers now.

10:04.244 --> 10:07.091
He's smiling. That's not a man on the run.

10:15.695 --> 10:16.775
DI Clayton.

10:24.779 --> 10:26.686
I've just had the call from Daisy's school.

10:26.737 --> 10:28.177
She's safe, she's been brought here.

10:28.226 --> 10:30.767
No, they can take her
home. I'll meet her there.

10:30.802 --> 10:31.679
OK.

10:31.750 --> 10:34.825
I've got officers on the door day
and night, I've got a panic alarm

10:34.860 --> 10:37.161
being fitted, we've got plainclothes
at the end of the street.

10:37.185 --> 10:40.689
I know. It's all been
explained. I can't work here.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.272
Your officers are scaring off my clients.

10:43.307 --> 10:44.848
I could take you both home.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.434
Explain it all to Daisy.

10:57.202 --> 10:59.882
Right, can you wait by
the car, please? Thank you.

11:06.495 --> 11:07.788
Look, I know you'll catch him.

11:07.823 --> 11:10.011
You're a brilliant cop, if nothing else.

11:10.094 --> 11:12.760
And I'll get Daisy to court,
it's good she hears it from you.

11:12.830 --> 11:15.200
- Thank you.
- Why is he back?

11:15.235 --> 11:18.069
I thought you said he'd want to
keep as far away from us as possible.

11:18.119 --> 11:22.026
- I'll tell you when I catch him.
- Well, I'm glad you're so confident.

11:23.385 --> 11:25.489
You've got luck on your side, haven't you?

11:29.443 --> 11:32.846
I saw the bracelet on her
wrist, Harry. Just like yours.

11:35.427 --> 11:38.520
Does she get you, is that
it? Do you get lucky together?

11:38.608 --> 11:40.048
Well, she's fun, at least.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.437
I'll find him. I'll catch him.

11:48.822 --> 11:50.062
Good luck.

11:53.752 --> 11:59.349
Nikhail Julian. Better known as Golding.

11:59.467 --> 12:03.175
He's guilty of multiple
murder, kidnapping, extortion,

12:03.219 --> 12:05.069
and blackmail.

12:05.120 --> 12:09.060
He exploited his role as prison
governor to build a criminal empire.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.176
Well, this is our chance
to put him away for good.

12:11.255 --> 12:14.664
We can track the van using CCTV.
How far have we got on that, anyone?

12:14.709 --> 12:16.151
And we'll need to go back
to the original witness.

12:16.175 --> 12:18.286
Find out exactly what she heard.

12:20.244 --> 12:23.108
- What?
- You can't be working on this case, Harry.

12:23.164 --> 12:25.406
Not with your personal history.

12:26.670 --> 12:29.485
- My history? What about yours?
- When we put him on trial,

12:29.555 --> 12:31.836
the defence will rip holes in
our case if you're involved.

12:31.877 --> 12:33.974
- You know that.
- I promised Anna.

12:36.245 --> 12:38.422
- Who's running it now?
- I am.

12:40.595 --> 12:44.198
- I'll keep you informed at every stage.
- What am I supposed to do?!

12:47.542 --> 12:51.645
Got a DNA match on the meat
found in Mr. Johnstone's stomach.

12:51.693 --> 12:52.304
What?

12:52.339 --> 12:55.664
The human remains. We
know who they belong to.

12:58.295 --> 12:59.521
Are you kidding me?

13:11.404 --> 13:13.797
Had to hire a pool car? Sexy.

13:14.257 --> 13:17.111
So. What have we got?

13:17.197 --> 13:18.247
The human remains found in.

13:18.271 --> 13:21.568
Mr. Johnstone's stomach belong
to a man named Adam Sykes.

13:21.632 --> 13:25.661
This is his house. Neighbours
haven't seen him for a week.

13:25.723 --> 13:29.214
Adam Sykes. Yeah, I knew him. Forger.

13:29.281 --> 13:32.200
Apparently, it was a fluke
we were able to get the DNA.

13:32.288 --> 13:35.049
Normally, when meat's cooked and
digested, you don't get anything,

13:35.122 --> 13:37.029
so... That was lucky?

13:38.592 --> 13:40.324
Police! Stay where you are.

13:42.295 --> 13:44.380
Let's go. Police!

13:44.437 --> 13:46.700
Listen, I get you don't want to be here.

13:46.834 --> 13:49.143
I'm not thrilled to be
working under you either.

13:49.222 --> 13:51.372
- That's your fault.
- Stay where you are!

13:51.436 --> 13:52.898
All right, so you're not responsible for

13:52.922 --> 13:54.981
any of the shit that's
going down right now?

14:04.741 --> 14:05.741
Anything?

14:06.878 --> 14:11.580
We've got incomplete passports,
false tax returns, gas bills...

14:11.663 --> 14:14.243
Everything you need to
set up a new identity.

14:14.290 --> 14:15.765
But no forger.

14:17.415 --> 14:21.320
No sign of a struggle, either.
So he was killed somewhere else.

14:23.436 --> 14:24.492
Maybe.

14:25.575 --> 14:29.806
The last time I caught Sykes,
he was trying to flog forged

14:29.873 --> 14:33.110
bare bonds to Russian
undergraduates from Imperial College.

14:33.190 --> 14:35.955
When we nabbed him, his
hands were covered in ink,

14:35.990 --> 14:38.145
his shirt was covered in his breakfast.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.567
This place doesn't...

14:43.341 --> 14:46.867
Can we get some Luminol
and UV lights in here?

14:46.929 --> 14:48.077
Good.

14:58.070 --> 15:00.668
- Again, please. Once more.
- You heard the DI.

15:08.444 --> 15:11.475
Wait, go back. There.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.373
Blood. Give me that.

15:14.182 --> 15:17.426
Well, if he was killed her,
it wouldn't be a single speck.

15:17.461 --> 15:19.772
- There'd be blood spatter and...
- And there.

15:26.111 --> 15:29.596
And there. Fshhh!

15:30.222 --> 15:32.462
- Arterial spray.
- Yeah.

15:33.696 --> 15:37.248
- Some job cleaning that up?
- Professional.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.896
The meat for the pies.
Where did she buy it?

15:40.959 --> 15:42.038
Smithfield.

15:47.396 --> 15:49.115
Right. Where do we start?

15:49.217 --> 15:52.755
Well, if she had no regular
supplier, and always paid cash...

15:52.860 --> 15:55.755
You do know we've had police
here searching already, yeah?

15:55.827 --> 15:57.486
Find the bloke that sold her the mince,

15:57.548 --> 15:59.795
we're one step closer to the killer.

15:59.884 --> 16:00.971
Brilliant.

16:01.878 --> 16:05.744
Right, I'll start down this
end. And I'll see you in a month.

17:06.586 --> 17:07.848
Hello.

17:07.929 --> 17:11.915
- I can't help you.
- Well, I haven't asked yet.

17:11.962 --> 17:14.432
I might be looking for
40 kilos of lambs' brains.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.877
You're a cop.

17:15.958 --> 17:20.002
Wouldn't get anything out of
anyone here. That's how it is.

17:20.085 --> 17:25.795
- And how do you know I'm a cop?
- The way you talk. The way you walked in.

17:25.854 --> 17:29.275
Takes a certain type of
person to recognise a cop.

17:29.310 --> 17:31.361
Normally, someone who's been in trouble.

17:34.030 --> 17:37.066
Some knife. Bet it's sharp.

17:37.655 --> 17:43.824
- It can cut straight through the bone.
- Really? Even human bone?

17:44.584 --> 17:50.316
I heard a story about some poor
bloke, had his arm cut clean off.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.198
How did that happen?

17:52.233 --> 17:55.416
Didn't look where he was going, so I heard.

17:59.108 --> 18:03.626
- Do you mind? That's unhygienic.
- Sorry.

18:03.684 --> 18:05.788
- We need some more, mate.
- I'll see you, Jim.

18:08.923 --> 18:13.385
So what do you use to keep
it all so spick and span?

18:13.420 --> 18:14.830
Why do you care?

18:15.496 --> 18:18.164
I'm just interested, you know?

18:18.400 --> 18:20.271
Must be a lot of blood
that needs cleaning up.

18:20.306 --> 18:21.466
I just wonder what you use to

18:21.493 --> 18:23.980
make sure there's no trace
of anything left behind.

18:24.064 --> 18:26.954
Solarvac cleaner? Amphesine?

18:28.630 --> 18:31.173
- Where do you keep it?
- In my van.

18:31.208 --> 18:33.232
I fancy taking a peek at that.

18:33.310 --> 18:37.217
- Bet it's spotless, too.
- Yeah, it is.

18:38.940 --> 18:41.300
Come on, then. It's this way.

19:15.350 --> 19:17.953
Backup. Get me backup, now.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.951
Harry, are you here?

19:23.632 --> 19:24.792
Harry?

19:33.865 --> 19:36.025
Who is it? Who we looking for?

19:41.671 --> 19:44.315
Needle in a haystack, Harry.

19:44.452 --> 19:45.702
Al, Any luck?

19:45.772 --> 19:48.012
- We found his van.
- Where?

19:52.967 --> 19:55.053
- Look at the plates.
- What?

19:57.703 --> 19:59.051
It's the van Golding was in.

19:59.129 --> 20:01.445
Looks to me like Golding's
taken him under his wing,

20:01.480 --> 20:04.635
protected him and used him for his skills.

20:04.744 --> 20:09.530
He kills his victims, he butchers
them, and they end up in pies.

20:10.650 --> 20:12.517
So the woman he abducted...

20:12.669 --> 20:14.868
We need to find her, fast.

20:19.971 --> 20:22.086
These cases are linked now, Harry.

20:22.948 --> 20:25.699
What, you're saying I
can't work on either case?

20:25.795 --> 20:28.695
I think Sykes was providing
a new identity for Golding,

20:28.780 --> 20:32.180
and once Golding got it, he got
rid of Sykes to cover his tracks.

20:32.252 --> 20:33.215
OK, stop.

20:33.250 --> 20:37.450
What we don't know is why Golding
didn't use that identity to escape.

20:37.485 --> 20:42.164
Sir, I found out who the
girl is. It's Eve Alexandri.

20:43.986 --> 20:46.430
- Golding killed her mother, right?
- Yeah.

20:46.488 --> 20:49.811
Wait, Harry, you-you knew her.
Why would Golding take her?

20:51.805 --> 20:53.005
I don't know.

20:55.976 --> 20:59.568
All right, Suri, dig out everything
else you can find on Miss Alexandri.

21:03.925 --> 21:04.818
Harry.

21:04.873 --> 21:07.107
I'm fine, I'm going home,
I'm not getting involved.

21:07.177 --> 21:09.345
You knew who she was
before I worked it out.

21:09.404 --> 21:11.837
You knew, and you didn't say, did you?

21:11.915 --> 21:14.678
My God, I can't believe
it. We're back here again!

21:14.747 --> 21:17.621
You doing stuff you shouldn't
be, and me having to cover it up.

21:17.656 --> 21:19.081
Suri, if I knew anything
else, I'd tell you.

21:19.105 --> 21:21.438
Ever since she turned up and you
started wearing that bracelet.

21:21.462 --> 21:23.727
What, this? I've had it for ages.
Richard gave it to me as a present.

21:23.751 --> 21:25.551
Ever since then, you've been odd.

21:25.586 --> 21:27.379
And by the way, it looks
really stupid on you.

21:27.403 --> 21:28.672
Suri, please.

21:28.707 --> 21:34.043
Why has he taken her?
It's me asking, not Winter.

21:35.925 --> 21:38.576
Tell me so I can find her!

21:42.435 --> 21:44.059
It's me, Harry.

22:21.431 --> 22:24.106
Hi. Been a while.

22:24.159 --> 22:26.921
If you're here about your man
Golding, it's a wasted trip.

22:26.956 --> 22:29.831
- They already told me.
- I wanted you to hear it from me.

22:31.365 --> 22:33.688
- Well, you're too late.
- Come on, Rich, I did what you asked.

22:33.712 --> 22:34.539
I've kept my distance.

22:34.613 --> 22:37.332
- And yet, here you are.
- Cos I miss you.

22:37.636 --> 22:39.774
I miss my brother.

22:42.081 --> 22:47.123
Look, maybe when this is over and we
catch him, we can go out for a pint?

22:47.929 --> 22:49.658
Just like that?

22:49.760 --> 22:51.328
Well, I'd be buying, obviously.

22:54.134 --> 22:55.134
Rich...

23:13.319 --> 23:15.348
You sounded so stressed on the phone,

23:15.398 --> 23:19.703
I thought you'd appreciate
a more soothing environment.

23:19.895 --> 23:23.924
I haven't had a chance to thank you
for your performance with my wife.

23:24.655 --> 23:29.818
Wasn't that hilarious?
She's gorgeous, by the way.

23:31.155 --> 23:32.698
You set all that up?

23:33.861 --> 23:38.719
I think you're meant to say,
"But not as gorgeous as you."

23:39.711 --> 23:42.283
You did. Jesus.

23:43.561 --> 23:46.466
I just wanted to see how you were with her.

23:48.355 --> 23:50.892
I'd like to know what's
stopping you from kissing me.

23:54.498 --> 23:58.804
My torch has been kidnapped.
Golding's involved.

23:58.916 --> 24:01.641
I don't know why, but I've
been kicked off the case,

24:01.724 --> 24:05.643
so I'm on my own without any
resources, and I have to find her.

24:08.323 --> 24:09.363
Isabella.

24:11.046 --> 24:16.732
I don't care. Neither would you
if you knew who she really was.

24:16.767 --> 24:18.332
What?

24:18.605 --> 24:21.680
Eve is my torch too.

24:23.567 --> 24:27.420
Yes, she's known about me
and the bracelet all along.

24:29.446 --> 24:32.213
Now, why didn't she tell you?

24:32.708 --> 24:33.817
I, err...

24:36.231 --> 24:37.739
I don't know why.

24:42.473 --> 24:45.707
I had two children, Harry.

24:48.043 --> 24:51.071
Two beautiful baby girls.

24:53.316 --> 24:59.625
And she's the reason I lost
them. Dead because of her.

25:00.679 --> 25:03.093
- Jesus, what happened?
- Don't.

25:05.967 --> 25:07.233
Forget about her.

25:07.312 --> 25:08.984
- What happened?
- No, don't.

25:16.565 --> 25:22.176
Isabella. She's my only
way to find Golding.

25:22.241 --> 25:24.647
To keep Anna and Daisy safe.

25:24.693 --> 25:26.881
- So do it.
- No, I can't without you.

25:27.864 --> 25:32.309
The man who caught Eve
cuts people to pieces.

25:32.387 --> 25:33.481
Good.

25:34.041 --> 25:36.887
That selfish little bitch
has sabotaged your life.

25:36.945 --> 25:39.710
- Right now, I don't care.
- But you will.

25:40.081 --> 25:41.726
Please help me.

25:44.508 --> 25:45.508
No.

25:47.445 --> 25:52.478
- You'd do the same if it was Daisy.
- Jesus.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.143
You'd do worse.

25:59.040 --> 26:03.280
- Stay away from me.
- I'm trying to save you.

26:07.514 --> 26:08.814
Stay away from me.

26:26.257 --> 26:27.257
Boss.

26:30.657 --> 26:34.579
- You said you'd be careful.
- I was. I was meticulous.

26:34.731 --> 26:37.282
- I don't know how he found me.
- You never know.

26:37.337 --> 26:39.994
That's the thing, the bloody thing.

26:40.068 --> 26:42.870
Now he knows you, we'll never catch him.

26:51.435 --> 26:52.975
I'll be more careful next time.

26:53.010 --> 26:56.428
It can't work, unless
we catch him unawares.

26:56.490 --> 26:59.761
That was the only way to get
him back here. Don't attack him.

26:59.796 --> 27:03.748
Just put him in that
and wait for him to die.

27:03.831 --> 27:06.749
It was the only way, the only bloody way.

27:06.784 --> 27:09.731
No. Just chop his head off.

27:09.766 --> 27:13.806
I keep telling you, you can't, you...

27:16.471 --> 27:19.315
don't know anything.

27:19.350 --> 27:20.750
It's over.

27:24.861 --> 27:27.901
Right. Change of plan.

27:35.133 --> 27:39.462
- What, because of some bloody bracelet?
- Forget about the bracelet.

27:39.561 --> 27:42.509
Forget about Harry. We
need to cover our tracks.

27:43.719 --> 27:47.613
Right. Kill her, get rid of the body.

27:48.375 --> 27:51.282
- No, wait. Wait.
- And no traces.

27:51.359 --> 27:52.616
I'll pay you after it's done.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.921
- Stop!
- Then you're on your own.

27:56.811 --> 27:59.810
I can help you. I can help you beat Harry.

28:00.089 --> 28:02.289
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

28:02.324 --> 28:04.550
There's a second bracelet and
I know the woman who wears it.

28:04.574 --> 28:05.894
She's stronger than he is.

28:07.324 --> 28:09.646
- No. No!
- Wait.

28:10.448 --> 28:15.209
If you get her on your side, you
can do anything you want to him.

28:18.933 --> 28:22.173
Just tell him to put down
the bloody knife. Yeah?

28:31.690 --> 28:36.126
Suri, how do you suppose
Harry just found the butcher?

28:36.189 --> 28:38.958
- I'm working.
- Cos I was watching him.

28:39.029 --> 28:42.259
He didn't do anything I wouldn't
have done, but it's always him.

28:42.294 --> 28:43.786
- He's always the one.
- Steve...

28:43.821 --> 28:45.352
I'm working.

28:55.583 --> 28:56.703
What've you got?

28:57.850 --> 29:02.019
Last year, we froze Golding's
bank accounts, assets, et cetera.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.154
But he's obviously still
got access to money somehow.

29:04.188 --> 29:08.572
Exactly. So I've used the facial
recognition software on cashpoints

29:09.283 --> 29:10.955
and got some hits.

29:12.389 --> 29:13.466
But the software's unreliable,

29:13.490 --> 29:16.018
so I'm hunting down guys that
look like Golding, but aren't him.

29:16.062 --> 29:17.262
It's a wild goose chase.

29:17.297 --> 29:22.708
No, not necessarily. Your
search is just too narrow.

29:23.904 --> 29:26.291
You want to find Golding,
you've got to look bigger.

29:52.382 --> 29:55.972
Well, you're not here to
preach the gospel, are you?

29:56.007 --> 29:57.219
Not quite.

29:57.281 --> 30:00.837
We're here to ask for your
help, Isabella Augustin.

30:00.942 --> 30:04.513
Goodness. They know my name. I'm ruined.

30:04.548 --> 30:06.908
We'd like you to help
us kill Harry Clayton.

30:20.570 --> 30:21.801
May I see it?

30:27.580 --> 30:31.526
Come get it, if you
think you're hard enough.

30:31.624 --> 30:34.469
Eve says you've been
wearing it for ten years.

30:34.652 --> 30:38.281
Says you can summon luck like
it's your own personal genie.

30:38.341 --> 30:40.011
Eve talks too much.

30:40.093 --> 30:42.171
And she gave the bracelet to the wrong man.

30:42.747 --> 30:45.004
I was always meant to have that bracelet,

30:45.053 --> 30:48.303
and I would have done so much
more with it than Harry ever could.

30:48.375 --> 30:50.207
I think he's growing into it quite nicely.

30:50.242 --> 30:51.580
No.

30:51.725 --> 30:53.610
His mind's too tidy.

30:53.727 --> 30:55.607
Too black and white.

30:55.716 --> 30:59.340
I think his mind is a little
darker than you realise.

30:59.431 --> 31:01.264
And he's good for me.

31:01.326 --> 31:02.220
If what Eve told me is right...

31:02.286 --> 31:04.842
You'd do well not to
mention that girl again.

31:07.114 --> 31:11.805
When Harry learns about your
predilections, he'll come after you.

31:11.891 --> 31:16.997
He'll hunt you down, and however
brilliant you may be, he will win.

31:19.112 --> 31:22.608
But not me. I would never stop you.

31:23.413 --> 31:25.974
I think Harry's falling for me.

31:27.257 --> 31:30.133
And I think he'll love me
in time, whatever my faults.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.128
He'll only ever love one woman.

31:43.676 --> 31:45.071
So what do you want?

31:45.106 --> 31:47.380
You help me get the bracelet off Harry,

31:47.469 --> 31:50.106
I get Eve to put it on me, and then...

31:51.655 --> 31:53.625
whatever you want.

31:53.750 --> 31:56.982
- You'll kill him?
- Of course.

31:57.120 --> 31:59.883
- And I could kill Eve, too, if you like.
- No.

32:01.318 --> 32:03.010
I want to do that.

32:55.154 --> 33:00.907
When my girls died, my body seized up.

33:02.421 --> 33:05.558
Grief grabbed me, choked me.

33:07.229 --> 33:10.540
I'd be walking down a road
and see a child, and...

33:10.801 --> 33:12.396
My legs would give way.

33:13.101 --> 33:17.300
I thought at least the
pain would one day pass.

33:17.553 --> 33:19.781
In a way, it has got better, but...

33:21.091 --> 33:25.039
Some days, I wake and it's

33:25.222 --> 33:27.582
a good minute before I think of them.

33:28.299 --> 33:30.094
Then I think of Eve...

33:32.575 --> 33:33.881
But I'll help.

33:37.576 --> 33:39.197
Because it's you.

33:42.309 --> 33:43.787
It's all I've got.

33:44.748 --> 33:47.819
Help me find her. Please.

33:49.799 --> 33:51.301
It's killing me.

33:55.357 --> 33:56.746
As you wish.

33:59.785 --> 34:02.132
You used the cashpoints to
find Golding, I then linked them

34:02.195 --> 34:04.380
with mobile phones being used in the area.

34:04.450 --> 34:05.856
That gives us 340 matches.

34:05.919 --> 34:08.906
We then ruled out any mobile
phones not paid for by cash or using

34:08.969 --> 34:10.089
pay-as-you-go contracts.

34:10.123 --> 34:11.936
- That brings us down to the three.
- The three.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.623
One of which is currently
being driven up the M1.

34:14.678 --> 34:17.757
Motorway cameras showed that to
be driven by a 29-year-old female.

34:17.793 --> 34:19.119
Another one was dropped down a toilet

34:19.143 --> 34:22.234
in a nightclub last night by
a teenager named Aaron Holt.

34:22.288 --> 34:24.172
And that leaves one.

34:24.206 --> 34:26.016
It's got to be Golding.
It's got to be Golding.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.856
We just need him to
turn his bloody phone on.

34:27.891 --> 34:29.636
And then we've got him.

34:29.737 --> 34:31.780
You're a good cop...

34:32.018 --> 34:35.580
- for a wally.
- First of all, who says "wally" anymore?

34:35.896 --> 34:37.510
Secondly, ditto.

34:38.716 --> 34:40.830
Even though I'm sure you'd
be a nightmare girlfriend.

34:40.864 --> 34:41.864
'Scuse me?

34:41.900 --> 34:44.507
Well, with your backhanded
compliments all day, everyday,

34:44.581 --> 34:46.732
I pity the... wally.

34:48.309 --> 34:49.676
Shut up.

35:08.354 --> 35:12.412
I think we're near. The
bracelets will lead us.

35:37.335 --> 35:38.584
We've got him.

35:39.296 --> 35:40.376
Let's go.

35:41.634 --> 35:44.333
Target located. We need SO19 now.

35:52.215 --> 35:55.260
So, luck brings us here.

35:55.620 --> 35:59.009
- You're sure?
- I think so.

37:14.903 --> 37:16.623
This is the place.

37:27.063 --> 37:28.734
We've found him.

37:28.801 --> 37:32.435
Yes, we have. Well done, darling.

38:29.496 --> 38:31.058
Are you ready yet?

38:31.126 --> 38:34.092
I just want to cut his
arm off with one slice.

38:34.523 --> 38:37.114
Well, I'm done waiting. Let's go.

38:39.200 --> 38:45.148
Right. In a minute, my friend here
is going to cut off Harry's arm

38:45.189 --> 38:48.032
thanks to Isabella and your introduction.

38:56.029 --> 38:59.608
Now, Harry might die of shock.

38:59.643 --> 39:01.490
More likely blood loss, actually.

39:01.553 --> 39:07.295
Either way, once he's gone, you
will give me the bracelet, right?

39:09.601 --> 39:12.481
Eve, do you understand me?

39:18.164 --> 39:19.484
Dear.

39:21.299 --> 39:24.015
Isabella, why?

39:24.284 --> 39:27.610
You were getting boring.

39:28.650 --> 39:32.479
And still in love with
your wife. I get jealous.

39:32.557 --> 39:33.147
Do it.

39:33.225 --> 39:36.540
And I was starting to like
you. That can be dangerous.

39:36.603 --> 39:39.855
It's much safer to feel nothing at all.

39:39.921 --> 39:43.068
At least with Golding, I
won't have to worry about that.

39:55.565 --> 39:57.222
Please.

39:57.278 --> 40:01.872
Did you really think I would choose
you over my lovely Harry Clayton?

40:04.552 --> 40:06.027
You bastard!

40:06.270 --> 40:07.270
Eve!

40:08.500 --> 40:09.739
Bastard!

40:12.999 --> 40:14.759
It's what you've always wanted.

40:16.476 --> 40:17.209
Eve, don't.

40:17.274 --> 40:20.848
- All my life. All my life, Harry.
- I know, but you can't.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.696
- Watch me.
- No, Eve!

40:22.731 --> 40:24.839
I will come after you, I will find you,

40:24.911 --> 40:27.200
and I will put you in
prison where he should be.

40:27.238 --> 40:30.803
- Then I'll kill you too.
- No, you won't. Put him away.

40:30.869 --> 40:34.091
- Make his pain last.
- I dreamed of this.

40:34.126 --> 40:38.764
I know, but we're not monsters, Eve.
There's no way back if you do this.

40:39.761 --> 40:40.961
Please.

41:05.248 --> 41:09.318
So I got him. Golding. As I promised.

41:11.050 --> 41:13.853
You have to start trusting me. You have to.

41:14.446 --> 41:16.086
No, you don't.

41:17.090 --> 41:20.360
- Harry, she'll hurt you.
- You just betrayed him.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.532
- He was going to kill me.
- He knows you're my torch.

41:22.567 --> 41:24.813
He knows all the lies you told.

41:25.585 --> 41:26.969
Harry, I promise.

41:27.024 --> 41:29.019
- You've got Golding. Please leave.
- Harry, I...

41:29.101 --> 41:30.983
She's right.

41:31.018 --> 41:35.534
You got what you want from me.
The police will be here soon.

41:36.881 --> 41:40.080
Come find me. Trust me.

42:00.189 --> 42:01.659
This is the end.

42:03.558 --> 42:04.678
Yes.

42:06.434 --> 42:08.937
An ex-prison governor behind bars?

42:10.908 --> 42:12.980
They're going to do terrible things to you.

42:19.171 --> 42:24.912
Harry! Harry, I'll give you £1
million. £1 million. Just let me go.

42:24.988 --> 42:29.650
- Smile!
- Harry! Harry, £2 million. Harry,

42:29.713 --> 42:35.525
- £2... £3 million! £5 million!
- Harry!

42:35.620 --> 42:38.214
Anna, we got him.

42:39.045 --> 42:42.719
Yeah, it's over. Sorry.

42:42.754 --> 42:44.416
The cavalry have arrived.

42:44.483 --> 42:46.368
Harry, what are you doing here?

42:46.403 --> 42:47.523
What took you so long?

42:50.349 --> 42:51.509
Still a lot of questions.

42:51.544 --> 42:52.839
You shouldn't have been anywhere near him.

42:52.863 --> 42:54.121
I was just out for a wee dander.

42:54.145 --> 42:58.415
Yeah, you've already given me
that utterly implausible story.

42:58.450 --> 43:00.565
I was worried when I heard
you'd found him first.

43:00.618 --> 43:04.223
I thought you might do something
stupid. I'm glad you proved me wrong.

43:04.354 --> 43:07.433
- Thank you.
- Bet Anna's relieved.

43:08.821 --> 43:10.181
Sure she is.

43:12.514 --> 43:15.805
- I'm trying not to interfere.
- Right.

43:15.840 --> 43:23.496
- So I-I'm no expert on your personal life.
- Alistair, I make her unhappy.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.018
No, you don't.

43:27.088 --> 43:28.435
I saw that last time she was here,

43:28.459 --> 43:31.518
the way she still looks
at you, God knows why.

43:32.290 --> 43:35.815
So you're not interfering?
Meanwhile, what's she doing?

43:35.850 --> 43:40.314
Tonight, I believe she's at
a ball with her new boyfriend.

43:41.342 --> 43:44.627
And you're doing what? Sitting here?

43:44.747 --> 43:49.487
You fool. Go. Now.

43:50.325 --> 43:51.685
Win her back.

44:32.098 --> 44:33.538
What are you doing here?

44:35.511 --> 44:38.978
Waiting for you. That's all I do.

45:14.138 --> 45:16.423
_ - A prototype driverless car

45:16.470 --> 45:18.894
went out of control and
drove into the water.

45:18.964 --> 45:21.005
Could someone have hacked
the operating system?

45:21.040 --> 45:23.626
If Winter found out that
you'd stolen evidence...

45:23.680 --> 45:25.961
- You want to be transferred?
- I'm not trusted.

45:25.996 --> 45:26.475
Harry!

45:26.510 --> 45:29.230
- This bracelet will drag him down.
- I won't let it.

45:29.290 --> 45:32.734
You have a chance, as long as
you stay away from Isabella.

45:32.769 --> 45:35.946
You're on something, and I'm
not the only one to notice.
