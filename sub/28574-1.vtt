02:28.550 --> 02:30.048
Can I send it back?

02:32.338 --> 02:34.253
I don't need a new computer.

02:37.208 --> 02:40.496
Just bill me for your percentage,
Patricia, I don't care.

02:58.268 --> 03:00.765
Good morning.
- Susanne, Sabine, Steffi...

03:11.005 --> 03:12.212
Fuck!

03:25.989 --> 03:27.529
I'm gonna lose it.

03:42.805 --> 03:43.887
Bye.

03:44.053 --> 03:46.217
Hey, you haven't had breakfast.

03:46.342 --> 03:47.882
I'm not hungry!

03:50.879 --> 03:52.003
Shit.

03:57.747 --> 03:59.911
Esther, are you awake?

04:02.325 --> 04:03.782
Morning.
- Morning.

04:09.442 --> 04:11.066
Morning.
- Morning.

04:25.800 --> 04:26.966
OK.

04:27.548 --> 04:29.046
May I?
- OK.

04:36.747 --> 04:37.746
Stop that.

04:37.912 --> 04:39.410
When we're married,

04:39.577 --> 04:41.533
I want a bath three times a day.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.614
When we're married...

04:46.778 --> 04:48.692
You mean to each other?

05:01.886 --> 05:03.469
Are you alright?

05:03.677 --> 05:05.258
Can I help you?

05:23.697 --> 05:24.987
No, no, thank you.

05:25.154 --> 05:26.277
It's alright.

05:26.402 --> 05:28.192
I'm fine, thank you.

05:32.688 --> 05:34.186
I'm fine.

05:58.326 --> 06:01.032
It only moves to the left.
Never to the right.

06:01.198 --> 06:03.321
I've pulled it up, down,

06:03.488 --> 06:06.443
I've moved the weight,
put it to the right, to the left...

06:06.609 --> 06:08.400
I cleared the stuff under the sink,

06:08.565 --> 06:12.229
I pulled the hose to the front, to the back,
I taped it down, hooked it up, you name it.

06:12.395 --> 06:15.517
But when I turn on the water,
the tap moves to the left.

06:15.725 --> 06:17.223
Only to the left.

06:17.390 --> 06:18.472
Always left.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.011
Call a plumber.

06:22.176 --> 06:25.132
What?
- Call a plumber.

06:28.253 --> 06:31.583
Ah shit. Like the tap is my problem.

06:37.909 --> 06:39.991
Loretta, please.

06:41.905 --> 06:44.112
I can't be your therapist.

06:45.276 --> 06:46.317
Why not?

06:47.191 --> 06:48.732
I'm your ex-husband.

06:48.897 --> 06:49.813
So what?

06:49.980 --> 06:53.143
You're also the only man
who sees right through me.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.051
Bladder cancer.

07:01.176 --> 07:02.883
Smoker?
- Yes.

07:04.922 --> 07:06.421
Long?

07:07.337 --> 07:08.835
Henriette.

07:17.492 --> 07:20.156
Did you know that,
of women who smoke as much as men,

07:20.323 --> 07:22.112
twice as many get bladder cancer,

07:22.279 --> 07:25.151
even though three times
as many men get it at all,

07:25.318 --> 07:27.940
and in Germany alone about fifteen...

07:34.308 --> 07:37.138
We have to drink more,
that's supposed to help.

07:45.921 --> 07:47.752
I'm sorry.

07:47.919 --> 07:50.249
I'm so late, it's terrible, sorry.

07:52.122 --> 07:53.621
That's new.

07:54.245 --> 07:56.534
Yes. It suddenly started doing that.

07:57.449 --> 07:59.198
It's the weather.

08:01.570 --> 08:02.903
Sounds good.

08:03.068 --> 08:04.567
What happened?

08:05.316 --> 08:07.231
Nothing happened.

08:08.397 --> 08:12.975
If you can't fight with your girlfriend
without her gambling away half her paycheck,

08:13.183 --> 08:15.680
maybe you should find yourself
a new girlfriend.

08:16.554 --> 08:19.218
Would you stop him if he wanted to?

08:20.300 --> 08:21.508
No.

08:22.756 --> 08:24.296
Do you consider David a grown man

08:24.463 --> 08:26.835
who can make his own decisions?

08:30.456 --> 08:34.119
In that case maybe you should
find yourself a new boyfriend.

08:37.032 --> 08:38.280
What happened?

08:44.816 --> 08:47.688
We had a date and he forgot.

08:48.812 --> 08:52.308
And when he showed up at my place later,
he still didn't remember.

08:52.433 --> 08:55.846
And when I called him on it,

08:56.012 --> 08:57.552
<i>he got angry-</i>

08:57.760 --> 08:59.425
He said I should have called him.

08:59.592 --> 09:02.547
He said I was just testing him.
- Is that true?

09:03.546 --> 09:04.753
No.

09:09.831 --> 09:11.954
I just don't want to be forgotten.

09:27.313 --> 09:30.101
This means not simply to settle for

09:30.268 --> 09:32.723
a more tolerable patient.

09:32.890 --> 09:37.010
Most importantly, we have to appeal
to the healthy part of the patient,

09:37.177 --> 09:39.091
no matter how small it may be.

09:39.216 --> 09:43.753
Allegedly, chronic tardiness
is merely a sign of rebellion,

09:43.961 --> 09:47.125
arrogance or unrealistic optimism,

09:47.249 --> 09:50.913
but definitely rooted
in a childhood conflict.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.118
Do you agree, Mrs. Lang?

09:56.157 --> 09:57.447
No.

09:59.154 --> 10:00.153
Why not?

10:00.319 --> 10:03.357
It's merely a sign of
not enough parking places.

10:07.894 --> 10:11.099
Voltaire wrote,
medicine is the art of passing the time

10:11.224 --> 10:13.721
the body needs to heal itself.

10:14.054 --> 10:15.511
How are you?

10:22.712 --> 10:26.041
Would you like some tea?
I was gonna make one anyway.

10:42.773 --> 10:45.937
I thought about getting a dog
for a really long time.

10:47.186 --> 10:49.183
19 years actually.

10:50.807 --> 10:53.137
My ex-wife didn't want a dog.

10:53.262 --> 10:56.967
She said she can't relate
to their sunny disposition.

11:05.874 --> 11:10.078
And now I got myself
the moodiest dog I could find.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.521
He wants to save everybody,

11:24.688 --> 11:26.477
what are you gonna do...

11:28.350 --> 11:29.848
Are you alright?

12:05.769 --> 12:07.475
Can I help you?

12:08.099 --> 12:10.389
I would like to plan a funeral.

12:12.470 --> 12:13.511
Really?

12:14.093 --> 12:15.549
Does that surprise you?

12:17.007 --> 12:18.880
No, it's just...

12:19.046 --> 12:22.542
most people who walk in here
have to plan a funeral.

12:22.751 --> 12:24.832
You say you would like to.

12:26.247 --> 12:27.953
I don't get that a lot.

12:28.161 --> 12:30.451
Are you always this blunt?

12:33.989 --> 12:35.945
I'm having a bad day.

12:37.735 --> 12:40.148
Can I offer you a cup of coffee?

12:40.273 --> 12:41.272
Yes, thank you.

12:41.439 --> 12:43.395
It's my funeral.

12:43.978 --> 12:45.518
Are you ill?
- What?

12:45.726 --> 12:48.806
No.
- It can be crushing to lose a loved one.

12:48.973 --> 12:50.679
Excuse me?
- Are you sure?

12:50.846 --> 12:53.718
Henriette, would you please
call the crematory and tell them...

12:53.884 --> 12:57.879
My brother has read all of your books,
he thinks you're a marvelous writer.

12:58.046 --> 13:00.044
...I'm gonna be late?
- Why can't l...?

13:00.169 --> 13:02.583
Don't you think she's a bit pale?
- Thank you.

13:16.069 --> 13:18.941
Where were we?
- My funeral.

13:20.315 --> 13:22.353
Can you put me on sick leave?

13:25.059 --> 13:26.474
Yes, sure.

13:30.678 --> 13:31.843
Good.

13:32.717 --> 13:34.133
Thank you.

13:35.589 --> 13:37.088
We still have time.

13:40.168 --> 13:41.750
You might.

13:50.823 --> 13:54.778
One of the upsides
of my imminent demise -

13:54.944 --> 13:59.523
apart from my own obvious advantages -

13:59.731 --> 14:01.645
is the fact

14:02.145 --> 14:05.350
that you will no longer be able
to hide out here.

14:06.348 --> 14:10.136
February 2004 until December 2005.

14:10.302 --> 14:13.882
Into the deep dark sea.

14:14.590 --> 14:16.255
I'm not hiding out.

14:16.421 --> 14:18.003
I like helping you.

14:18.169 --> 14:22.040
Would you like something to eat?
- No thanks, I'm not hungry.

14:25.536 --> 14:26.827
Sunny?

14:28.158 --> 14:30.780
You don't need to visit every day.

14:42.477 --> 14:44.849
Mr. Bender, you have to leave now.

14:45.682 --> 14:46.681
Please.

14:46.847 --> 14:48.720
If someone sees you here...

14:49.844 --> 14:51.425
How is he?

14:52.966 --> 14:55.754
You know I'm not authorized to tell you.

15:00.124 --> 15:01.623
See you tomorrow.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.450
I love you.

15:41.664 --> 15:42.871
Get out!

15:43.037 --> 15:44.077
Out!

16:42.349 --> 16:43.806
Yes, of course.

16:45.928 --> 16:48.384
I'll call if I see her.

16:48.800 --> 16:49.966
Sure.

17:00.788 --> 17:04.866
If I'm gonna risk your mother's goodwill,
I need to know why.

17:09.154 --> 17:10.902
Have you been drinking?

17:11.693 --> 17:12.692
No.

17:13.316 --> 17:15.646
So that's why you don't dare to go home.

17:17.478 --> 17:19.476
Please, don't say anything to Morn, OK?

17:19.685 --> 17:22.098
Or she might not let me go
to the concert on Friday,

17:22.223 --> 17:24.429
and I've had those tickets forever!

17:24.887 --> 17:27.342
And you think I won't get mad?

17:27.467 --> 17:28.883
Dad, please.

17:29.799 --> 17:33.461
And tell her
if she ever disappears like that again,

17:33.670 --> 17:36.999
I will not only confiscate
her iPad and her phone, I will...

17:37.124 --> 17:38.123
Shit.

17:38.997 --> 17:40.370
Hang on a second.

17:40.495 --> 17:43.076
You and I agreed that
we don't negotiate with terrorists...

17:43.242 --> 17:45.157
Why do you make your life so difficult?

17:45.323 --> 17:47.571
Why does she make my life so difficult?

17:48.112 --> 17:50.110
Seriously, my appendix could rupture

17:50.235 --> 17:52.483
and she would still ask me
how I did in math.

17:52.690 --> 17:55.437
Honey, they took out
your appendix years ago...

17:58.102 --> 17:59.558
Sure,

17:59.725 --> 18:01.140
I'll tell her.

18:02.055 --> 18:03.763
No, never again.

18:04.345 --> 18:06.260
I'll take her to school tomorrow.

18:06.675 --> 18:08.632
OK. Bye.

18:18.871 --> 18:20.370
Are you still there?

18:20.495 --> 18:23.824
<i>I have to tell you something
and please don't hang up.</i>

18:23.991 --> 18:25.031
What?

18:25.156 --> 18:27.528
<i>It's incredibly sexy
when you get so mad...</i>

18:31.899 --> 18:33.189
Damn.

18:36.977 --> 18:38.975
I forgot all about you. Come here.

18:41.472 --> 18:46.425
Of all the funeral homes in the world
she had to walk into yours.

18:49.297 --> 18:51.628
Is she married?
- No.

18:54.624 --> 18:56.123
In a relationship?

18:56.332 --> 18:58.329
Not that I know of.

18:58.829 --> 19:00.618
And you'd know.

19:04.698 --> 19:08.651
As far as I know, her boyfriend
got killed in Syria two years ago.

19:08.818 --> 19:10.941
He was a war photographer.

19:11.107 --> 19:13.438
She hasn't published anything since.

19:18.641 --> 19:20.971
You think she wants to kill herself?

19:21.221 --> 19:22.844
No! What makes you say that?

19:23.053 --> 19:25.966
Come on, someone wants
to arrange her own funeral.

19:26.133 --> 19:30.129
Who does such a thing without
planning to die any time soon?

19:30.253 --> 19:33.083
A reasonable, considerate person

19:33.792 --> 19:36.788
who doesn't want to be
anyone's burden after her passing.

19:36.954 --> 19:39.452
Oh please, only you could think like that.

19:48.151 --> 19:50.315
You think she wants to die?

19:50.482 --> 19:53.021
No. But I think she has a problem.

19:53.521 --> 19:55.435
And I don't mean a health problem.

20:48.253 --> 20:51.709
<i>Isabelle? Finally!
Please don't hang up again.</i>

20:51.875 --> 20:55.496
<i>Listen. I can't wait forever.
I'm gonna cancel Tom's lease.</i>

20:56.204 --> 20:57.910
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

20:59.991 --> 21:01.739
<i>OK. If you refuse to talk to me,</i>

21:01.906 --> 21:04.403
<i>I'll decide what to do with Tom's stuff
without you.</i>

21:04.528 --> 21:06.318
<i>Let me know if you want to keep any...</i>

21:52.435 --> 21:55.432
Watch it, Sunny,
you're gonna end up in China.

21:57.389 --> 21:58.845
What?

21:59.178 --> 22:01.675
I mean if you keep scrubbing...

22:01.842 --> 22:03.257
Never mind.

22:05.296 --> 22:08.002
Are you going to the
company party next week?

22:26.399 --> 22:29.520
But I have to let someone go,

22:29.729 --> 22:32.351
and Sunny is the one with the least...

22:32.517 --> 22:34.141
You can't fire Sunny.

22:34.307 --> 22:36.430
She knows every animal here by name.
- KrÃ¼ger!

22:37.013 --> 22:39.760
Sunny named them herself.

22:40.426 --> 22:42.299
Yeah, so?
- All the animals, even the...

22:50.373 --> 22:53.204
She counts the penguins four times a day.

22:53.370 --> 22:56.326
OK, then I quit.
- Don't be ridiculous!

22:57.158 --> 22:59.156
I mean it, I quit.

22:59.323 --> 23:02.361
And you keep Sunny on. Or I quit for sure!

23:02.735 --> 23:05.067
And you can't afford to lose us both.

23:06.148 --> 23:08.813
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

23:24.504 --> 23:26.669
If you go, I'll go too.

23:27.376 --> 23:28.832
What?

23:29.541 --> 23:31.205
To the company party.

23:32.079 --> 23:34.535
Oh right. Yes. I'm going.

23:35.492 --> 23:36.991
So we'll go together.

23:37.157 --> 23:38.656
That's nice.

23:39.321 --> 23:44.732
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven...

23:44.982 --> 23:49.186
Sunny, they're all still here.
-12,13,14,15,16,17...

23:59.175 --> 24:01.631
OK, one, two, three...
- Sunny!

24:05.128 --> 24:07.126
A pilot with a fear of flying.

24:09.164 --> 24:11.162
Sounds like a bad joke.

24:14.867 --> 24:17.156
Robert would make fun of me.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.817
We've been together for 13 years now.

24:24.482 --> 24:27.187
You know the last time I've been scared?

24:29.143 --> 24:32.057
When I thought I'd lost his phone number,

24:32.224 --> 24:34.263
the first night we met.

24:36.260 --> 24:38.508
He knows everything about me.

24:39.341 --> 24:41.005
And me about him.

24:44.002 --> 24:46.666
But I only met his mother two weeks ago.

24:48.664 --> 24:50.912
When Robert fell into a coma.

24:53.951 --> 24:55.449
NHL.

24:57.113 --> 24:58.612
Cancer.

24:59.819 --> 25:01.484
Non-Hodgkin.

25:01.692 --> 25:02.982
I'm familiar with it.

25:03.107 --> 25:04.356
Sure.

25:04.522 --> 25:07.020
Some of your best friends are gay, right?

25:09.850 --> 25:11.515
My brother.

25:13.096 --> 25:15.053
1993.

25:18.300 --> 25:19.839
I have to go.

25:21.088 --> 25:22.628
We still have time.

25:24.793 --> 25:26.124
I want to help you.

25:26.249 --> 25:27.997
I think I can help you.

25:28.164 --> 25:30.037
Look. I'm sorry about your brother.

25:30.662 --> 25:33.492
But if you want to help me,
spare me the sympathy.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.281
You have no idea how I feel.

25:43.189 --> 25:44.688
Hey, hi.

25:44.854 --> 25:49.350
I hope I'm not too late.
I missed the bus by a thread.

25:50.890 --> 25:54.844
If you don't stick to the arrangement,
I won't either.

25:55.885 --> 25:57.758
What are you doing here?

25:57.924 --> 25:59.422
Wait a minute.

25:59.631 --> 26:03.876
So I'm not the only one who didn't know
your girlfriend was coming tonight?

26:05.957 --> 26:09.536
Or did you tell him and he forgot?

26:10.744 --> 26:12.200
I invited her, Mom.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.072
What?

26:15.530 --> 26:17.528
What arrangement?

26:17.736 --> 26:19.360
Yeah, what arrangement?

26:19.734 --> 26:22.481
Why don't you guys head inside...
- Come on, honey.

26:22.689 --> 26:24.146
I want to get a good seat.

26:26.143 --> 26:28.475
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

26:28.683 --> 26:32.012
I could have told you it's a bad idea.
- A bad idea?

26:32.471 --> 26:33.719
It was Lars' idea.

26:33.885 --> 26:37.965
And he knows very well that his mother
doesn't like it... - What about you?

26:40.046 --> 26:42.585
A little late to ask that, don't you think?

26:46.871 --> 26:48.370
What arrangement?

26:52.158 --> 26:53.364
Sorry.

27:27.287 --> 27:30.450
I swear I'm gonna shoot myself
before this kid is getting a drum set.

27:30.659 --> 27:33.114
If Esther is getting a drum set,
I want a moped.

27:33.239 --> 27:35.861
Esther is getting a drum set?
- No, but I want one.

27:36.069 --> 27:38.816
When do you get that speaking English
doesn't work anymore?

27:38.983 --> 27:41.230
As soon as you stop failing English.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.478
Oh and you can smoke and I can't?

27:43.686 --> 27:45.101
Exactly.

27:46.725 --> 27:48.640
It's all downhill from here.

27:48.805 --> 27:50.388
You suck!

27:50.595 --> 27:52.885
Alright, that's it.
The concert tomorrow is off.

27:53.051 --> 27:54.175
What?!

27:54.300 --> 27:55.798
Excuse me.

27:56.589 --> 27:58.587
There go the rats.

28:00.710 --> 28:02.625
Go screw yourself.

28:20.606 --> 28:22.020
Dr. Lang!

28:22.145 --> 28:23.602
Oh, hello.

28:24.102 --> 28:25.766
What are you doing here?

28:25.975 --> 28:28.222
Lars is in the orchestra, David's son.

28:28.347 --> 28:30.178
He invited me.

28:30.470 --> 28:32.301
That's David,

28:32.468 --> 28:34.341
the one with the cell phone.

28:34.507 --> 28:36.879
Father of the flute.
- Exactly.

28:40.875 --> 28:42.915
My daughter is in the orchestra too.

28:43.082 --> 28:44.538
Which one is it?

28:44.705 --> 28:46.703
The furious cello.

28:50.282 --> 28:51.822
Do you have a seat up front?

28:52.030 --> 28:53.653
No, I'll stay back here.

28:53.820 --> 28:55.526
David has...

28:55.734 --> 28:58.149
I don't want to spoil
the evening for Lars.

28:58.273 --> 29:02.227
You mean you don't want Lars' mom
to spoil the evening for Lars.

29:04.517 --> 29:06.764
Are you gonna bill me for that one?

29:07.431 --> 29:09.429
That one was on the house.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.795
I'll see you Tuesday?

29:17.960 --> 29:20.083
In case we miss each other later.

29:31.113 --> 29:32.529
You know what?

29:32.737 --> 29:36.108
I'm done
dragging your daughter to rehearsals.

29:36.233 --> 29:39.063
As far as I'm concerned,
she can just quit cello.

29:39.230 --> 29:43.642
I've been tearing my hair out for ten years
and I like my hair. Now it's your turn.

29:43.808 --> 29:46.639
If you want her to keep playing,
you drive her.

29:46.805 --> 29:48.012
Alright.

29:50.301 --> 29:51.799
Who is that?

29:52.299 --> 29:54.963
The girlfriend of the father of the flute.

29:57.169 --> 29:59.084
David's?
- Yes.

30:03.579 --> 30:05.119
Patient?

30:11.945 --> 30:13.610
It's a small world.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.605
With big problems.

31:15.252 --> 31:19.498
If we were at your place, no one would
have to leave in the middle of the night.

31:19.706 --> 31:20.872
Yes.

31:21.038 --> 31:22.453
You would.

31:23.826 --> 31:25.325
Why?

31:27.240 --> 31:30.986
No offense
but you're not exactly stepfather material.

31:42.099 --> 31:43.181
Do us a favor

31:43.348 --> 31:46.677
and wait with having kids
for as long as you can.

31:48.175 --> 31:52.588
No offense but I don't think
you can afford to wait much longer.

31:53.420 --> 31:54.918
Excuse me?

31:55.751 --> 31:57.874
I'm not getting any younger either.

32:09.070 --> 32:10.651
I'm serious.

32:13.108 --> 32:15.022
I was afraid of that.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.578
I was looking for you.

32:52.149 --> 32:54.147
How much did you lose?

32:56.228 --> 32:58.684
You mean other than my self-respect?

33:44.968 --> 33:48.048
Where the hell are you coming from now?

33:48.839 --> 33:51.253
And where the hell are you coming from?

33:53.459 --> 33:54.833
Hey, stop!

33:54.999 --> 33:57.622
Are you totally gone?
Tell me where you were, right now.

33:59.702 --> 34:01.658
None of your business!
- Are you nuts?

34:01.825 --> 34:04.031
You tell me where you were or...
- Or what, eh?

34:04.156 --> 34:06.445
Let me smell your breath.
- No, leave me...

34:06.653 --> 34:08.235
Screw you!

34:08.400 --> 34:10.774
No wonder Dad couldn't stand you anymore!

34:11.856 --> 34:14.187
I couldn't stand him anymore.

34:17.059 --> 34:18.889
Why are you dressed?

34:19.056 --> 34:21.304
I was looking for your sister.

34:21.471 --> 34:24.176
That's a total lie!
She was gone all night!

35:40.012 --> 35:41.011
Mr. Geller?

35:41.136 --> 35:43.259
Would you like to start?

35:44.008 --> 35:46.630
There is nothing wrong with me.
- There is a lot wrong with me.

35:46.796 --> 35:49.044
There is nothing wrong with you.

35:50.626 --> 35:55.579
Henriette thinks we suffer
from all kinds of fatal diseases.

35:57.035 --> 35:58.825
It used to be just her.

36:00.656 --> 36:02.322
Now I am terminally ill too.

36:02.946 --> 36:05.860
You're my brother,
of course I worry about you.

36:06.026 --> 36:09.356
She's even suspecting our clients now.

36:10.938 --> 36:12.228
But...

36:13.060 --> 36:14.808
you are undertakers.

36:14.975 --> 36:17.763
Our living clients.
- I was just wondering.

36:17.930 --> 36:19.845
You would have wondered too.

36:39.699 --> 36:41.905
Mark has trouble sleeping lately.

36:43.195 --> 36:44.776
Excuse me?

36:44.984 --> 36:48.315
How do you know...?
- Oh please, I know everything about you.

36:48.814 --> 36:50.313
Is that true?

36:51.187 --> 36:52.560
Well...

36:54.974 --> 36:57.138
She's my sister.

36:57.263 --> 36:59.344
Of course I tell her things but...

36:59.553 --> 37:02.383
I mean, is it true
that you have trouble sleeping?

37:02.715 --> 37:03.714
Oh.

37:04.381 --> 37:07.877
Sometimes I have a hard time
falling asleep, that's true.

37:08.044 --> 37:09.458
Are you worried?

37:09.667 --> 37:12.580
Of course he's worried. Aren't you?

37:14.787 --> 37:17.617
I have no idea
how to do all that in one semester.

37:17.783 --> 37:20.281
We always meet Wednesdays,
if you want to join us.

37:20.446 --> 37:21.862
I'm not always free.

37:22.736 --> 37:25.650
Or I just bring the stuff
and we meet whenever.

37:25.816 --> 37:28.147
That would be great. Let's do that.

37:28.272 --> 37:29.646
Mrs. Lang?

37:32.808 --> 37:34.307
See you later.
- Don't go.

37:34.474 --> 37:37.553
You want to go to lunch with me'?
- I can't, sorry.

37:38.844 --> 37:42.340
How about we do something this weekend,
you and me and your daughters?

37:42.548 --> 37:45.254
This weekend doesn't work.
Another time, OK?

37:45.420 --> 37:47.834
I gotta go, I'll call you later.
- You say that every time.

37:49.041 --> 37:50.706
What... Are you crazy?

37:52.080 --> 37:53.578
What's the matter with you?

37:53.786 --> 37:54.827
Nothing.

37:54.994 --> 37:56.825
I'm really just busy.

37:57.282 --> 38:00.571
Esther wants to paint her room and I...
- You know what?

38:00.738 --> 38:04.566
Even my ego isn't big enough
to ignore how you treat me.

38:05.857 --> 38:08.812
I don't want the girls
to get a wrong impression, that's all.

38:08.979 --> 38:11.102
How about any impression at all?

38:11.226 --> 38:12.933
Trust me, the last thing I need

38:13.099 --> 38:16.845
is having to explain to the girls
in six weeks why you ran away.

38:18.968 --> 38:20.591
Why I ran away?

38:20.757 --> 38:21.965
You see me running away?

38:22.714 --> 38:24.712
You're the one running away!

38:29.040 --> 38:30.289
Slower.

38:42.693 --> 38:44.191
Can I ask you something?

38:44.316 --> 38:45.690
Of course.

38:49.019 --> 38:52.141
Why don't you find yourself
a different boyfriend?

38:53.140 --> 38:55.970
Why, you want to get rid of me?
- No.

38:59.133 --> 39:01.548
Seriously, why do you say that?

39:02.422 --> 39:04.877
You could find a guy who is nicer to you.

39:06.376 --> 39:08.665
I think my therapist thinks that too.

39:11.121 --> 39:12.661
You have a therapist?

39:22.691 --> 39:24.814
We don't choose the ones we love.

39:26.188 --> 39:29.768
Panama, first you
have to change your behavior

39:29.976 --> 39:33.139
then your feelings will change too.
Trust me.

39:51.078 --> 39:52.410
I'm early.

39:52.618 --> 39:55.365
No problem.
But I need to take a quick walk.

39:56.489 --> 39:58.903
Would you like to wait inside?
I can let you in.

39:59.070 --> 40:00.401
No, thanks.

40:01.067 --> 40:03.856
OK, then. See you in a few minutes.

40:04.022 --> 40:05.521
Panama, let's go.

40:09.433 --> 40:10.765
Panama!

40:15.885 --> 40:17.717
Would you like to join us?

40:19.381 --> 40:21.129
Sure, I can do that.

40:25.334 --> 40:28.830
Is being late a compulsion for you?
- It wasn't my fault.

40:29.038 --> 40:30.619
Aren't you embarrassed?

40:30.786 --> 40:33.325
I'm always embarrassed. Give me that.

40:33.533 --> 40:35.031
And be quiet!

40:42.066 --> 40:43.272
Hello.

40:46.561 --> 40:47.893
Hello.

40:59.089 --> 41:01.170
Do you come to rehearsals a lot?

41:01.336 --> 41:03.418
I've never seen you here.

41:03.626 --> 41:04.667
No, I...

41:06.081 --> 41:08.620
Usually my wife... Eleonor...

41:08.828 --> 41:11.659
Usually my ex-wife takes my daughter.

41:11.825 --> 41:14.322
Eleonor is my daughter, not my wife.

41:14.447 --> 41:16.945
My wife's name is Loretta. My ex-wife's.

41:18.485 --> 41:20.483
But the two of them are currently...

41:20.691 --> 41:22.606
Well, it's my turn for now.

41:36.757 --> 41:38.381
I am Sophie.

41:43.458 --> 41:44.457
Maximilian.

41:45.165 --> 41:46.163
Max.

41:47.329 --> 41:49.369
Nice to meet you, Max.

41:59.192 --> 42:01.647
And what do you do for a living, Max?

42:04.478 --> 42:05.976
I'm a doctor.

42:06.559 --> 42:08.390
Well, I'm not a real doctor.

42:08.599 --> 42:11.179
But sometimes I help people.

42:12.011 --> 42:13.634
I try.

42:20.044 --> 42:22.209
And you? What do you do for a living?

42:26.787 --> 42:27.953
OK,

42:28.702 --> 42:30.366
you have to ask me two questions.

42:30.575 --> 42:32.698
First: what do you do for a living?

42:32.864 --> 42:35.361
And then: what is your problem?

42:36.069 --> 42:36.901
OK.

42:37.318 --> 42:39.191
What do you do for a living?

42:40.148 --> 42:42.188
I'm an actress.

42:46.933 --> 42:49.638
Excuse me,
what was the second question?

42:51.344 --> 42:52.801
What is your problem?

42:53.966 --> 42:55.549
No, you have to...

42:56.464 --> 42:57.921
Never mind.

42:58.628 --> 43:00.626
Shall we go get a cup of coffee?

43:04.080 --> 43:05.371
Why not?

43:05.579 --> 43:07.161
Coffee! Yes.

43:09.242 --> 43:10.366
Good.

43:17.775 --> 43:19.564
So ask me again.

43:20.147 --> 43:21.271
OK.

43:21.437 --> 43:23.269
What is your... no.

43:24.393 --> 43:26.266
What do you do for a living?

43:26.432 --> 43:27.930
I'm an actress.

43:29.470 --> 43:31.136
And what is your...?
- Timing!

43:33.924 --> 43:35.339
What is your...?

43:39.252 --> 43:42.415
You don't tell a lot of jokes, do you?
- Me?

43:43.747 --> 43:46.245
You keep raw pasta in your purse'?

43:51.822 --> 43:53.445
That is horrifying.

44:02.727 --> 44:03.976
And now you.

44:04.101 --> 44:06.473
Make a typical gesture.

44:08.762 --> 44:10.718
I don't have one, I don't know.

44:16.712 --> 44:18.002
Kleenex!

44:21.707 --> 44:26.867
I once had a therapist who handed me
a roll of toilet paper instead of a tissue.

44:31.362 --> 44:33.735
And now you have a different therapist.

44:34.069 --> 44:35.068
Oh yeah.

44:35.650 --> 44:37.315
He's completely different.

44:39.396 --> 44:41.144
He's very nice.

44:41.311 --> 44:43.724
A bit strict. But very nice.

44:45.597 --> 44:47.263
May I ask why?

44:48.386 --> 44:49.968
Well, he thinks I'm not...

44:50.134 --> 44:52.132
I mean why you're in therapy.

44:59.333 --> 45:02.289
I'll tell you
when I get to know you better.

45:08.198 --> 45:12.693
For months everything's under control,
everything's calm.

45:14.234 --> 45:17.897
Then suddenly,
there is a sock missing in the laundry,

45:18.063 --> 45:20.685
the faucet is going nuts,
the garbage starts to smell,

45:20.894 --> 45:22.683
your daughter wants you dead,

45:22.850 --> 45:25.014
and your lover is getting serious.

45:30.050 --> 45:33.256
You think our first-born
got switched in the hospital?

45:37.209 --> 45:39.665
Oh well, at least we have the other one.

45:41.038 --> 45:42.953
I'm dropping out of school.

45:44.659 --> 45:46.657
I'm too old for this shit.

45:48.655 --> 45:50.945
See, you think so too.

45:58.645 --> 45:59.893
Are you serious?

46:00.018 --> 46:01.516
That's easy for you to say.

46:01.683 --> 46:04.347
You were in school
when your hair wasn't grey yet.

46:04.555 --> 46:07.219
No, I meant are you serious
that that's your problem,

46:07.385 --> 46:10.049
that your boyfriend wants to get serious.

46:10.216 --> 46:13.213
He's not my boyfriend, he's my lover.

46:14.836 --> 46:17.125
If he's serious, he's your boyfriend.

46:19.914 --> 46:21.745
Well, you're a great help.

46:21.912 --> 46:25.408
What am I paying you for,
so you can insult me?

46:25.575 --> 46:27.198
Unbelievable.

46:27.364 --> 46:30.652
You're not paying me.
- You're a killjoy, you know that?

46:30.819 --> 46:32.983
No wonder your wife left you.

46:41.266 --> 46:42.515
German, please.

46:43.930 --> 46:45.594
I don't understand you.

46:47.842 --> 46:49.757
You want to order?

46:53.170 --> 46:55.793
If you made up your mind, let me know.

47:00.620 --> 47:04.574
She's allergic to nuts and just wants
to know if any of that has nuts in it.

47:04.741 --> 47:06.614
That'll be the day.

48:31.066 --> 48:33.688
You want a drink?
- I'll have a beer.

48:33.896 --> 48:34.937
Cheers.
- Cheers.

48:35.062 --> 48:36.643
Two tall beers.

48:36.851 --> 48:38.391
40, 42?

48:41.388 --> 48:42.387
There.

48:43.053 --> 48:45.717
I'm not wearing those.
- If you want to bowl here you are.

48:45.925 --> 48:47.299
Absolutely not.
- It's OK.

48:48.548 --> 48:50.628
She has her own pair.
- OK.

48:55.373 --> 48:57.746
You bought me bowling shoes?

49:04.530 --> 49:07.236
OK, watch this.
- Yeah, let's see that.

49:09.026 --> 49:10.150
Oh, right...

49:53.853 --> 49:55.267
Hannes!

49:56.975 --> 49:59.263
Shut up everyone for a moment.

50:01.678 --> 50:04.674
Hannes, here's to you, you old...

50:05.673 --> 50:07.546
Shit, <i>I</i> just...

50:07.713 --> 50:10.335
We've been shuffling shit
together for 15 years,

50:10.543 --> 50:14.039
and I've never seen you mess up.

50:14.164 --> 50:15.995
I wish you well, you old fart.

50:16.162 --> 50:18.618
Is it your birthday?
- To Hannes!

50:19.617 --> 50:21.324
Bottoms up!

54:09.247 --> 54:11.495
And you didn't tell her who you are?

54:11.661 --> 54:12.910
No.

54:15.324 --> 54:17.822
Wouldn't it be better to tell her the truth?

54:18.987 --> 54:20.485
What for?

54:22.567 --> 54:25.022
Because the truth might help you?

54:27.769 --> 54:30.766
Why don't you just give me
something for the fear?

54:30.933 --> 54:32.015
I can do that.

54:32.140 --> 54:35.719
But under the influence of such medication
you wouldn't be able to fly a plane.

54:36.302 --> 54:39.714
And it might be wise to confront the fear
rather than suppress it.

54:39.881 --> 54:43.627
How many times do you want me to say it?
I have no reason to be afraid of flying.

54:43.794 --> 54:47.248
I've been a pilot for 19 years.
I've never been afraid.

54:47.373 --> 54:49.663
Even when I didn't know how to fly yet.

54:49.829 --> 54:52.576
I've been through four emergency landings
and I don't know how many storms.

54:52.743 --> 54:54.740
I bring down every plane safely.

54:55.240 --> 54:57.238
I've never made a mistake.

54:59.860 --> 55:01.775
I just want to fly again.

55:02.482 --> 55:04.064
That's all.

55:11.556 --> 55:13.678
Morning, Sunny.
- Morning.

55:13.845 --> 55:15.510
You gonna get by without Hannes?

55:15.676 --> 55:18.757
I'm sure he'll be in soon.
- He's not coming back.

55:18.923 --> 55:20.796
He quit.

55:20.963 --> 55:22.836
Didn't you know that?

55:23.377 --> 55:24.916
Morning.
- Morning.

55:25.999 --> 55:27.997
Yesterday was his last day.

55:28.954 --> 55:31.202
He said he'll find something better.

55:40.150 --> 55:41.940
Is there a family grave?

55:42.731 --> 55:43.855
No.

55:43.980 --> 55:46.643
<i>My boyfriend's body
got dumped somewhere in Syria.</i>

55:46.852 --> 55:48.391
I don't know where.

55:49.724 --> 55:53.303
His parents finally
buried an empty casket back here.

55:56.799 --> 56:00.503
I'm definitely not going into the ground
next to an empty casket.

56:00.670 --> 56:05.165
<i>I could show you
some of the cemeteries if you like.</i>

56:05.957 --> 56:07.913
How many are there in Hamburg?

56:08.037 --> 56:09.619
<i>54.</i>

56:24.145 --> 56:27.267
Mona doesn't want you
to spend so much time with Lars.

56:27.808 --> 56:28.890
What?

56:29.015 --> 56:32.220
She's concerned
he'll connect with you emotionally

56:32.386 --> 56:34.717
and only get hurt once we break up.

56:35.134 --> 56:37.589
And what makes her think we'll break up?

56:43.042 --> 56:46.538
She says I've never had
a serious relationship except with her,

56:46.704 --> 56:49.202
so she assumes
we'll break up eventually too.

56:50.992 --> 56:52.823
And what did you say?

56:52.989 --> 56:57.360
I told her
Lars will inevitably spend time with you

56:57.527 --> 56:59.525
once you and I live together.

57:03.936 --> 57:05.559
Excuse me?

57:47.140 --> 57:52.094
I heard this happens when you breathe into
a bag without actually hyperventilating.

57:52.259 --> 57:54.882
I want you to look after yourself better.

57:55.048 --> 57:58.045
I'm way too busy looking after you.

58:39.459 --> 58:41.874
But I didn't put my keys there.

58:41.998 --> 58:45.495
Does anyone else live with you that
I don't know about? - Very funny.

58:47.076 --> 58:48.658
See you later.

59:08.178 --> 59:10.468
David wants us to move in together.

59:18.293 --> 59:19.958
The noise is gone.

59:21.498 --> 59:23.496
That's a big adjustment.

59:35.983 --> 59:37.606
Don't you want to sit down?

59:56.961 --> 01:00:00.290
I have an appointment
to look at a flat around the corner.

01:00:01.996 --> 01:00:03.537
Want to come along?

01:00:03.744 --> 01:00:08.364
The floors are all refinished
and a whole new kitchen will be put in.

01:00:08.573 --> 01:00:11.278
Of course we can accommodate
any special wishes

01:00:11.486 --> 01:00:14.899
you and your husband might have
if you're interested.

01:00:18.687 --> 01:00:21.850
I'm trying to teach him
not to drag me all over town,

01:00:21.975 --> 01:00:24.140
but he really doesn't care.

01:00:24.931 --> 01:00:27.136
Maybe he's a lost cause.

01:00:28.843 --> 01:00:30.840
I don't believe in lost causes.

01:00:34.337 --> 01:00:35.835
Then maybe you're one too.

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.833
190 square meters...

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:48.863
My husband is in research.

01:00:50.362 --> 01:00:52.277
At the university hospital.

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:56.480
And you are also...
- I'm an actress.

01:00:56.647 --> 01:00:57.937
Great.

01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:20.912
Listen, I'm gonna to talk to Lars
about this myself, OK? Good...

01:01:21.079 --> 01:01:24.118
OK. Yes, talk later. Yes.

01:01:27.905 --> 01:01:30.152
Not on the couch, Panama.

01:01:36.979 --> 01:01:42.556
I shouldn't mention it but being a childless
couple puts you at the top of the list.

01:01:47.676 --> 01:01:48.757
There.

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:57.373
Hey, you don't give
my daughter cigarettes, understood?

01:01:57.582 --> 01:01:59.496
I'm sorry, Mr. Lang.

01:02:02.077 --> 01:02:03.991
Where have you been, anyway?

01:02:09.485 --> 01:02:12.774
Have you ever heard
of Alien Hand Syndrome? - No.

01:02:18.975 --> 01:02:23.887
You can get it after a stroke
or because of a brain tumor.

01:02:24.386 --> 01:02:28.590
And then your own hand
may actually try to strangle you.

01:02:29.964 --> 01:02:31.754
Out of the blue?

01:02:33.544 --> 01:02:34.917
Well...

01:02:38.829 --> 01:02:40.827
I don't want a service.

01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:46.155
It wouldn't be for you
but for the people you leave behind.

01:02:47.612 --> 01:02:49.859
I never got the point of that.

01:02:50.526 --> 01:02:53.813
Nobody tells the truth
and everyone's scared to be next.

01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:57.227
It helps to say goodbye.

01:02:59.724 --> 01:03:01.305
I don't believe that.

01:03:05.759 --> 01:03:07.840
Your books helped me.

01:03:09.713 --> 01:03:12.335
You don't seem
like someone who needs help.

01:03:13.626 --> 01:03:15.499
Occupational hazard.

01:03:20.119 --> 01:03:22.117
Is it true what people say?

01:03:22.741 --> 01:03:24.905
That you don't want to write anymore?

01:03:43.885 --> 01:03:45.633
Can I take you home?

01:03:45.967 --> 01:03:47.173
No.

01:03:47.298 --> 01:03:49.754
Can I walk with you a bit?
- No.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.206
I tried calling you a few times
but you never pick up.

01:03:59.327 --> 01:04:01.200
Why did you quit?

01:04:02.115 --> 01:04:04.197
I needed a change of scenery.

01:04:07.152 --> 01:04:09.857
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

01:04:11.522 --> 01:04:13.562
I didn't want you to be sad.

01:04:16.809 --> 01:04:20.221
I always thought
if I ever drop dead in my apartment,

01:04:20.346 --> 01:04:22.636
you'd be the one to find me.

01:04:27.256 --> 01:04:30.585
That is the most romantic thing
a woman has ever said to me.

01:04:32.083 --> 01:04:33.582
I didn't mean it that way.

01:04:33.791 --> 01:04:35.622
Forget it, I gotta go.

01:04:37.453 --> 01:04:38.951
But I would!

01:04:39.659 --> 01:04:41.074
I would love to find you!

01:04:43.239 --> 01:04:46.193
I mean I wouldn't love it.
But I would find you!

01:05:02.218 --> 01:05:03.675
Hello. May I...

01:05:04.965 --> 01:05:06.631
Follow me, please.

01:05:30.563 --> 01:05:33.352
I'm sorry,
he's probably stuck at the office.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.141
I got ten minutes.

01:05:35.308 --> 01:05:38.804
If you have any questions,
I'll be in the kitchen. - Thank you.

01:05:48.961 --> 01:05:50.000
Excuse me.

01:05:50.917 --> 01:05:53.456
I thought I was the only one left here.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.150
I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

01:06:11.602 --> 01:06:13.351
Do you like the apartment?

01:06:14.724 --> 01:06:16.223
Yes.

01:06:24.673 --> 01:06:26.379
Do you want it?

01:06:28.543 --> 01:06:30.374
I don't need a new apartment.

01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:39.698
Why are you looking at one then?

01:06:42.736 --> 01:06:45.192
I like the idea of a new apartment.

01:06:52.933 --> 01:06:56.555
If you don't really want to move,
why don't you just say so?

01:06:56.763 --> 01:06:59.344
Why are we looking
for an apartment at all?

01:06:59.551 --> 01:07:01.758
Or rather, why am I looking for one?

01:07:01.924 --> 01:07:04.588
You hardly ever...
- Of course I want to move.

01:07:04.755 --> 01:07:07.252
I just forgot the appointment.

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:10.207
Do you have any idea
how busy I am right now?

01:07:10.374 --> 01:07:13.329
I just don't have time
to look at all these places.

01:07:13.536 --> 01:07:15.035
But this was your idea.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.199
Why am I the one
bothering you about it?

01:07:18.365 --> 01:07:22.027
I don't need to move. I like living here.
- I don't get it.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.564
What?

01:07:28.438 --> 01:07:31.601
You paid my rent without telling me?
Are you nuts?

01:07:31.767 --> 01:07:36.471
You were four months behind.
I just made sure you wouldn't get evicted.

01:07:36.637 --> 01:07:39.468
And instead of arguing...
- I can take care of myself.

01:07:39.634 --> 01:07:42.215
Yeah, sure,
you prove that almost every day.

01:07:45.502 --> 01:07:47.375
I don't want you to pay my rent

01:07:47.584 --> 01:07:50.206
and I don't want you
to move in with me for my sake.

01:07:50.372 --> 01:07:51.871
And why not?

01:07:52.579 --> 01:07:55.284
Why can't I do something for your sake?

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.156
What's so wrong with that?

01:07:58.281 --> 01:08:01.070
I'm not your problem, I'm your girlfriend.

01:08:01.236 --> 01:08:02.734
It's always the same.

01:08:02.901 --> 01:08:04.607
What is always the same?
- Nothing.

01:08:04.774 --> 01:08:06.897
Where are you going?
- I'm going home.

01:08:38.738 --> 01:08:42.651
Sunny, it's time
for George to settle his affairs.

01:08:44.939 --> 01:08:47.435
Do you understand what that means?

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:53.596
OK, I'm gonna go.
You can call me anytime, day and night.

01:11:10.493 --> 01:11:13.115
We don't say goodbye
to the people we love.

01:11:17.027 --> 01:11:18.775
But I can't picture it.

01:11:23.188 --> 01:11:24.936
Picture what?

01:11:26.892 --> 01:11:29.098
I can't picture me without him.

01:11:38.921 --> 01:11:40.544
Hello.
- Hello.

01:11:41.168 --> 01:11:42.750
I'm sorry...

01:11:52.324 --> 01:11:53.822
ls everything alright?

01:11:53.988 --> 01:11:55.320
I should have called.

01:11:55.528 --> 01:11:57.151
Do you want to come in?

01:11:57.318 --> 01:11:58.567
I'd rather not.

01:11:59.191 --> 01:12:02.063
I was hoping
we could maybe go somewhere.

01:12:04.519 --> 01:12:07.807
You try so damn hard
not to become like everyone else,

01:12:07.932 --> 01:12:10.845
and then you become
exactly like everyone else.

01:12:14.425 --> 01:12:16.673
Do you think it's a good idea that we...

01:12:16.838 --> 01:12:19.336
Will I see you at rehearsals tomorrow?

01:12:25.954 --> 01:12:27.286
Of course.

01:12:56.255 --> 01:12:58.586
Why can't I just be someone else?

01:13:15.693 --> 01:13:16.734
What's that?

01:13:17.733 --> 01:13:19.064
That?

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:22.768
That's the end of your excuses.

01:13:23.684 --> 01:13:26.264
Excuse me?
- So you won't be late anymore.

01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:30.552
I wasn't sure about hand or foot breaks,

01:13:30.719 --> 01:13:32.467
so I went for hand breaks.

01:13:33.299 --> 01:13:36.587
It has eight gears and I got you a lock,

01:13:36.753 --> 01:13:38.751
so it won't get stolen right away.

01:13:38.918 --> 01:13:40.708
You want to try it?

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:42.289
No.

01:13:46.118 --> 01:13:50.073
Why are you giving me a bicycle?!
- Cause I'm enjoying it, I...

01:13:50.239 --> 01:13:52.237
But I don't want a bicycle.

01:13:52.446 --> 01:13:55.525
I like my car.
I always drive. I never ride a bike.

01:13:55.692 --> 01:13:58.189
That is so...
- That is so what?

01:14:02.268 --> 01:14:05.182
I can't start over, that's crazy.

01:14:06.514 --> 01:14:08.012
What do you mean?

01:14:08.179 --> 01:14:09.760
Of course you can.

01:14:15.212 --> 01:14:17.710
I don't want to start over.

01:14:24.869 --> 01:14:25.993
Yeah.

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:30.031
I heard you.

01:15:04.285 --> 01:15:07.116
You have to give them back to me.
- No, <i>I</i> don't.

01:15:07.865 --> 01:15:09.696
I want them back, all of them.

01:15:09.863 --> 01:15:12.985
<i>Isabelle, how much longer
do you want to go on like this?</i>

01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:15.108
I want you to give me your keys.

01:15:15.273 --> 01:15:17.563
<i>It's not your apartment, Isabelle.</i>

01:15:18.562 --> 01:15:21.142
<i>The lease runs out
at the end of this month.</i>

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:23.931
<i>It's time. For you too.</i>

01:15:24.056 --> 01:15:25.887
That is not your decision to make!

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.719
<i>He is not coming back!</i>

01:15:44.909 --> 01:15:47.323
I really appreciate it. Keep the change.

01:15:47.531 --> 01:15:49.696
Thank you.

01:15:56.479 --> 01:15:58.519
Where is your sister?

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:03.264
At the doctor's.

01:16:21.952 --> 01:16:26.157
You know, lately, I keep thinking
that maybe it's enough already.

01:16:29.237 --> 01:16:31.984
That I've buried enough people.

01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:34.898
Comforted enough people.

01:16:45.053 --> 01:16:48.508
I bet you'd rather deal
with your own problems too.

01:16:51.671 --> 01:16:53.835
If that's the impression I make,

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:56.665
then I'm even more in trouble than you are.

01:16:59.954 --> 01:17:02.035
The dog gave you away.

01:17:10.817 --> 01:17:12.815
You think I'm in trouble?

01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:19.100
It's not easy to take in
the grief of others day after day.

01:17:29.006 --> 01:17:31.878
You're probably better at my job than I am.

01:17:34.292 --> 01:17:35.874
Or you at mine.

01:17:55.395 --> 01:17:56.893
Are you Dr. Lang?

01:17:58.309 --> 01:17:59.932
Yes, I am.

01:18:01.555 --> 01:18:03.012
Can I help you?

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:04.218
No.

01:18:11.336 --> 01:18:13.334
Would you like to come in anyway?

01:18:14.083 --> 01:18:16.539
You must have me confused
with someone else.

01:18:16.705 --> 01:18:18.578
My father died a long time ago.

01:18:20.451 --> 01:18:22.116
How do you know?

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:28.817
From my mother.

01:18:33.147 --> 01:18:36.893
Then you have to ask your mother
why she is lying to you.

01:18:39.556 --> 01:18:40.971
I can't.

01:18:41.096 --> 01:18:43.136
My mother passed away six years ago.

01:19:12.271 --> 01:19:15.934
Last time I saw my father
was 40 years ago. - 42.

01:19:25.716 --> 01:19:27.547
This is his address.

01:19:27.713 --> 01:19:31.335
I'm always there in the afternoons.
I can let you in.

01:19:34.831 --> 01:19:36.745
You don't have much time.

01:20:10.168 --> 01:20:12.082
You know what? I don't believe you.

01:20:12.249 --> 01:20:16.453
I don't believe you want to live with me,
you just want to know that you can.

01:20:16.619 --> 01:20:19.991
You want me to come to you,
but you don't want me to be with you.

01:20:20.116 --> 01:20:22.405
What does that mean? I'm here, aren't I?

01:20:22.571 --> 01:20:25.318
What do you want me to do?
Tell me. I have no idea.

01:20:26.026 --> 01:20:27.608
What do you want from me, Sophie?

01:20:27.815 --> 01:20:30.022
I want to believe you.

01:20:30.147 --> 01:20:33.227
I don't want to be the one
who can't believe you anymore.

01:20:33.434 --> 01:20:36.640
My life would be so much easier
if I had stayed with Mona.

01:20:47.961 --> 01:20:49.168
Don't. Don't go.

01:20:49.376 --> 01:20:51.083
Let me go!

01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:20.926
You better go in alone.

01:21:22.674 --> 01:21:24.089
I'll wait here.

01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:26.753
If he needs anything...

01:21:53.391 --> 01:21:55.389
Was this your idea?

01:21:57.095 --> 01:21:58.219
No.

01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:01.425
Sunny was...
- Is she my sister?

01:22:09.707 --> 01:22:11.747
I thought you were dead.

01:22:14.202 --> 01:22:16.866
Your mother would have
probably preferred that.

01:22:17.033 --> 01:22:19.613
So what! Where have you been?

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:40.133
He adopted me when my mother died.

01:22:41.965 --> 01:22:44.087
Shortly after they got married.

01:22:47.001 --> 01:22:49.499
He tried to be a good father.

01:22:55.034 --> 01:22:56.491
I have to go.

01:22:56.657 --> 01:22:59.029
Will you come back?
- No.

01:22:59.821 --> 01:23:02.401
I'll tell him you'll be back.
He'll like that.

01:23:07.188 --> 01:23:09.393
Did he ever talk about me?

01:23:12.974 --> 01:23:13.972
Every day.

01:25:13.886 --> 01:25:16.758
Do you think
we all just get what we deserve?

01:25:18.673 --> 01:25:20.795
No, I think we get a whole lot more.

01:25:38.734 --> 01:25:41.066
What do you do
when you can't help someone?

01:25:45.602 --> 01:25:46.935
Max.

01:25:49.931 --> 01:25:51.138
Max.

01:25:54.551 --> 01:25:56.091
It's time.

01:26:34.092 --> 01:26:37.172
What makes you so sure
you don't deserve better?

01:26:42.084 --> 01:26:43.457
What?

01:26:47.453 --> 01:26:49.451
He loves me, I'm sure of that.

01:26:50.033 --> 01:26:51.532
Not enough.

01:26:56.236 --> 01:26:58.150
How can you know that?

01:26:59.024 --> 01:27:01.022
How can you not know that?

01:27:14.716 --> 01:27:16.547
I'll be right back.

01:27:58.170 --> 01:28:01.167
I'm afraid
I can't be your therapist anymore.

01:28:02.831 --> 01:28:04.079
What?

01:28:05.911 --> 01:28:08.534
Listen...
- I'm sorry. I really should go now.

01:28:08.741 --> 01:28:09.740
Where is my bag?

01:28:09.865 --> 01:28:12.695
I didn't mean to...
If I said anything that you...

01:28:12.862 --> 01:28:15.609
I didn't want you to think that I think...
It wasn't my intention to...

01:28:15.734 --> 01:28:16.941
Goodbye...

01:28:54.151 --> 01:28:55.567
I just want to fly again.

01:28:59.479 --> 01:29:01.477
And come home to him at night.

01:29:03.850 --> 01:29:06.513
I want the lights to be on
when I open the door.

01:29:08.178 --> 01:29:11.342
I want music to play
and the smell of food in the air.

01:29:12.673 --> 01:29:16.212
I want to hear him laugh
about something on the radio.

01:29:17.835 --> 01:29:19.874
I want him to get mad at me

01:29:20.915 --> 01:29:22.705
and kiss me anyway.

01:29:24.036 --> 01:29:27.033
Because he always kisses me
after I landed safely.

01:29:41.850 --> 01:29:43.391
Laurie told me

01:29:44.681 --> 01:29:47.553
that she and her mother
pray by his bedside,

01:29:49.342 --> 01:29:50.925
for hours.

01:29:52.839 --> 01:29:55.253
They want to save his soul.

01:29:57.459 --> 01:29:59.374
They have to hurry.

01:30:12.568 --> 01:30:14.108
Everything drives me nuts.

01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:16.480
I thought maybe I'm menopausing.

01:30:16.647 --> 01:30:20.102
Well, everything drives me nuts
all the time anyway.

01:30:20.226 --> 01:30:22.516
But now it's even worse.

01:30:25.096 --> 01:30:27.011
You're not menopausing.

01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:30.216
You're pregnant.

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:40.080
Is that good news or bad news?

01:30:53.024 --> 01:30:55.564
When did you sneak in here?

01:30:56.063 --> 01:30:58.852
Does Mom know you're here?
- Who cares.

01:31:06.844 --> 01:31:08.342
Yeah, she's here.

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:12.004
I just found her.

01:31:13.003 --> 01:31:15.085
I have no idea, I didn't hear her.

01:31:15.792 --> 01:31:17.790
Come on, get up, I'm taking you to school.

01:31:17.915 --> 01:31:22.827
The poor man was declared dead
and then froze to death in the morgue.

01:31:25.906 --> 01:31:28.237
So apparent death is not the problem.

01:31:29.236 --> 01:31:30.235
Exactly.

01:31:31.567 --> 01:31:33.565
The others are the problem.

01:31:39.392 --> 01:31:40.474
Not you.

01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:14.647
Everything OK here?
- Everything's fabulous.

01:32:16.602 --> 01:32:18.018
Can we go?

01:32:39.245 --> 01:32:40.535
Sunny!

01:32:56.185 --> 01:32:58.058
And is that... I mean...

01:32:58.225 --> 01:33:00.348
The appointment is tomorrow.

01:33:00.514 --> 01:33:02.512
Tomorrow?! What time tomorrow?

01:33:03.635 --> 01:33:05.343
If you're busy, I'll go alone.

01:33:05.508 --> 01:33:07.174
Wait a minute. Hold it.

01:33:07.381 --> 01:33:08.505
Stop.

01:33:21.325 --> 01:33:23.115
You've already made up your mind?

01:33:23.864 --> 01:33:25.737
I can't have a kid.

01:33:30.773 --> 01:33:32.230
That's not true.

01:33:32.979 --> 01:33:34.477
Says who?

01:33:34.644 --> 01:33:37.641
Think about it, Sunny.
And you wouldn't be alone.

01:33:37.808 --> 01:33:39.514
I don't want to have a kid.

01:33:44.134 --> 01:33:46.382
Can't you... couldn't we...

01:33:46.839 --> 01:33:50.336
If you give me a chance...
- It has nothing to do with you.

01:33:53.374 --> 01:33:54.498
What?

01:33:58.744 --> 01:34:01.698
I don't want a kid. I never wanted a kid.

01:34:01.823 --> 01:34:05.944
I don't want to be anyone's mother,
and I don't want to be anyone's girlfriend.

01:34:06.111 --> 01:34:08.192
I don't want to be with you.

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:10.481
I don't want to be with anyone.

01:34:10.689 --> 01:34:12.521
I want to be alone.

01:34:14.019 --> 01:34:17.765
And if you don't want to help me,
I can handle this without you.

01:34:41.698 --> 01:34:43.446
My dad's at the dentist.

01:34:43.613 --> 01:34:45.069
Sophie has some set job.

01:34:45.194 --> 01:34:47.484
I can't believe they think we don't get it.

01:34:47.650 --> 01:34:49.148
What do you mean?

01:34:49.856 --> 01:34:52.312
OK, I can't believe
they think I don't get it.

01:34:52.478 --> 01:34:55.475
We're going to a club tonight.
Wanna come?

01:34:55.641 --> 01:34:58.263
It's a cool place,
nobody asks how old you are.

01:35:00.095 --> 01:35:02.842
You don't have the guts.
- Of course I do.

01:35:03.008 --> 01:35:05.839
Well, then don't tell your stepmom.
- OK.

01:35:06.005 --> 01:35:07.753
Or your dad.
- OK.

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.126
And especially not your mom.

01:35:25.069 --> 01:35:26.068
No.

01:35:26.317 --> 01:35:27.649
No!

01:35:31.687 --> 01:35:33.518
Let me through!

01:35:33.685 --> 01:35:37.181
I have to see him one more time!

01:35:37.846 --> 01:35:40.261
I have to see him one more time!

01:35:40.427 --> 01:35:41.842
No!

01:35:42.716 --> 01:35:45.213
I have to see him!

01:35:55.245 --> 01:35:56.743
Hold this?
- Sure.

01:35:58.116 --> 01:35:59.907
Oh, sorry.

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:06.690
You know I...

01:36:08.563 --> 01:36:11.935
I promise I'll never turn into my mom,

01:36:12.726 --> 01:36:16.597
if you promise
you'll never turn into your dad.

01:36:16.764 --> 01:36:18.095
Promise?

01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:19.718
Cross my heart.

01:36:23.007 --> 01:36:24.755
Let's drink to that.

01:36:28.959 --> 01:36:31.997
Has your mom called the cops yet?
- I hope not.

01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:39.156
I don't want to go home yet, you?

01:36:39.365 --> 01:36:40.779
Me neither.

01:36:42.319 --> 01:36:43.526
Here.

01:38:02.817 --> 01:38:03.566
Shit!

01:38:13.347 --> 01:38:15.387
Are you out of your mind?

01:38:17.968 --> 01:38:20.132
Why don't you come to the front door?

01:38:20.839 --> 01:38:22.630
Would you have let me in?

01:38:26.833 --> 01:38:28.498
I have something to say to you.

01:38:34.033 --> 01:38:35.324
What?

01:38:37.155 --> 01:38:39.570
It would be easier if you weren't armed.

01:38:42.524 --> 01:38:44.148
Where is she? How is she?

01:38:45.022 --> 01:38:46.604
I'm sorry Mr. Lang, I...

01:38:46.812 --> 01:38:48.435
What you have done with my daughter?
- Nothing!

01:38:48.602 --> 01:38:50.516
Stop it!
- What did you give her?

01:38:50.683 --> 01:38:52.722
Are you crazy? It's not his fault!

01:38:52.847 --> 01:38:55.470
Are you the father?
- Yes, I am Max Lang.

01:38:55.677 --> 01:38:57.592
How is she? Can I see her?

01:38:57.758 --> 01:38:59.257
Come with me.

01:39:00.839 --> 01:39:04.126
We've pumped your daughter's stomach.
She's stable.

01:39:04.626 --> 01:39:08.788
We're gradually getting her blood pressure
under control too. She was lucky.

01:39:08.913 --> 01:39:10.245
What did she take?

01:39:10.454 --> 01:39:11.952
4-MTA.

01:39:12.576 --> 01:39:17.154
It's a kind of slow Ecstasy
with a high risk of overdose.

01:39:17.737 --> 01:39:19.735
Good thing the boy was with her.

01:39:21.358 --> 01:39:25.146
Get yourself some coffee,
it'll be a while before she wakes up.

01:39:28.434 --> 01:39:30.848
And because I already know
what you don't even suspect,

01:39:30.973 --> 01:39:33.304
I'm kicking you out of my class.
- Excuse me'?

01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:35.843
If you want to learn something,
find someone else.

01:39:35.967 --> 01:39:38.090
I want to be your boyfriend,
not your teacher.

01:39:38.257 --> 01:39:41.628
I want to wake up next to you,
have breakfast with your daughters,

01:39:41.795 --> 01:39:44.500
I want to stay with you
when they leave the house,

01:39:44.667 --> 01:39:48.496
and 40 years from now, I still want to know
how you are and what's on your mind,

01:39:48.663 --> 01:39:50.577
but your phone keeps ringing

01:39:50.744 --> 01:39:53.782
and I'm starting to think
maybe you should get that.

01:40:03.023 --> 01:40:05.686
Where did you get that stuff?
- I don't know.

01:40:06.144 --> 01:40:07.434
Did you take it too?
- No.

01:40:07.601 --> 01:40:09.682
If you're lying to us now...
- He's not lying.

01:40:09.806 --> 01:40:11.430
He didn't even know she took it.

01:40:12.013 --> 01:40:15.051
Wait a minute, I thought Lars was with you?

01:40:15.218 --> 01:40:17.715
Alright that's it, I'm taking you two home.

01:40:17.882 --> 01:40:19.921
I don't want to go.
I want to know how Elli is doing.

01:40:20.087 --> 01:40:22.835
You've made enough trouble for...
- Hey!

01:40:56.091 --> 01:40:57.755
Can I see her?

01:40:58.671 --> 01:40:59.670
Yes,

01:40:59.795 --> 01:41:01.626
but she's not awake yet.

01:41:13.448 --> 01:41:15.321
It's my fault.

01:41:15.486 --> 01:41:17.484
It's not your fault.

01:41:20.481 --> 01:41:22.813
You're just saying that
so I won't go nuts.

01:41:22.937 --> 01:41:25.601
No. I'm just saying that
so I won't go nuts.

01:41:30.096 --> 01:41:32.053
She hates me

01:41:32.718 --> 01:41:34.591
and I don't know why.

01:41:35.799 --> 01:41:38.046
All sixteen year old girls
hate their mother.

01:41:38.171 --> 01:41:40.876
It's in their DNA.
- I know.

01:41:41.043 --> 01:41:42.916
But it doesn't help.

01:41:46.163 --> 01:41:50.075
If she still hates you 20 years from now,
we'll talk again.

01:42:03.145 --> 01:42:05.933
I'm afraid I lost my heart to a patient.

01:42:08.222 --> 01:42:11.511
You lost your heart
to your patients years ago.

01:42:18.336 --> 01:42:22.082
If you consider our hopeless affinity
for impossible relationships,

01:42:22.290 --> 01:42:24.872
it's bewildering we ever got divorced.

01:42:25.995 --> 01:42:30.491
You can't marry your best friend
and hope to get away with it.

01:42:43.726 --> 01:42:46.182
I don't know what I would do without you.

01:42:51.926 --> 01:42:53.674
There you are!

01:43:00.583 --> 01:43:02.082
I'm sorry.

01:45:07.864 --> 01:45:09.072
Is everything OK?

01:45:11.819 --> 01:45:13.525
That child sleeps like a rock.

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:16.938
Come with me.

01:45:24.014 --> 01:45:26.594
I really don't think
we should wake her up now.

01:45:26.803 --> 01:45:30.424
She'll hate me before we get a chance
to get to know each other.

01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:32.172
Good morning, sweetie.

01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:34.295
I want you to meet someone.

01:45:34.461 --> 01:45:36.043
Are you awake?
- No.

01:45:37.749 --> 01:45:39.830
You want to go back to sleep?

01:45:40.496 --> 01:45:42.202
This is Fabian.

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:45.865
Hi Esther.

01:45:46.032 --> 01:45:48.071
I heard you have a band.

01:45:48.987 --> 01:45:51.984
I had a band too when I was..
- Fabian is my boyfriend.

01:45:52.650 --> 01:45:53.690
Fabulous.

01:45:53.815 --> 01:45:57.395
I'm so glad you woke me up
for this news flash.

01:45:58.644 --> 01:46:02.847
There is no way
this could have waited until breakfast.

01:46:03.929 --> 01:46:05.428
Thanks a lot.

01:46:19.205 --> 01:46:21.370
Give me your phone.
- What? No.

01:46:22.826 --> 01:46:25.323
Give me your phone!
- Over my dead body...

01:46:25.781 --> 01:46:27.488
Stop that...Are you crazy?

01:46:27.696 --> 01:46:29.319
Come get it!

01:46:33.190 --> 01:46:35.937
Don't you ever do that again!

01:46:36.104 --> 01:46:37.643
I was just joking around...

01:46:37.810 --> 01:46:40.599
Swallowing a bunch of pills
and almost dying is no joke.

01:46:40.807 --> 01:46:44.303
If something happens to you,
it's not just your life that's over.

01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:48.049
That's the deal when you're loved,
whether you like it or not.

01:46:48.216 --> 01:46:50.047
Do you get that?

01:46:50.879 --> 01:46:52.170
Yes.

01:46:53.876 --> 01:46:55.167
OK.

01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:06.113
And from now on
you'll be nicer to your mother.

01:47:06.322 --> 01:47:08.485
She knows ten times more than I do.

01:52:15.368 --> 01:52:17.448
You can't treat people like that.

01:52:19.613 --> 01:52:21.069
I mean

01:52:21.194 --> 01:52:23.775
I think you can't treat people like that.

01:52:24.566 --> 01:52:28.062
Because you'll end up all alone.

01:52:28.187 --> 01:52:29.935
And I know you like being alone,

01:52:30.102 --> 01:52:32.557
but not always, and then you'll be alone.

01:52:32.724 --> 01:52:36.095
And then nobody will come meet you
this time of night, in some bar,

01:52:36.261 --> 01:52:37.802
or anywhere else.

01:52:40.341 --> 01:52:42.796
Because you can't treat people like that.

01:52:42.921 --> 01:52:44.420
I'm sorry.

01:52:50.955 --> 01:52:53.660
And it's not always your decision alone.

01:52:54.534 --> 01:52:58.197
And sometimes you're not alone
even though you would rather be,

01:52:58.405 --> 01:53:02.068
because maybe the other person wouldn't,

01:53:02.276 --> 01:53:05.272
and that's something you do for someone.

01:53:05.439 --> 01:53:07.562
When you love someone.
- I kept it.

01:53:10.974 --> 01:53:12.098
What?

01:53:13.389 --> 01:53:15.803
I didn't do it. I kept it.

01:53:30.828 --> 01:53:31.994
Here.

01:53:32.951 --> 01:53:35.074
So you can find me.

01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:23.981
I don't know a lot
and the older I get, the less I know,

01:54:24.146 --> 01:54:25.770
but one thing I know for sure.

01:54:25.936 --> 01:54:28.933
When my time is up,
I want to remember the things I did

01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:31.264
and not the ones I didn't.

01:54:31.431 --> 01:54:33.970
I'll rather regret the risks I took in vain

01:54:34.136 --> 01:54:37.757
than remember those
I successfully avoided.

01:54:40.754 --> 01:54:42.669
What are you doing here?

01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:50.577
I made a mistake.

01:54:55.655 --> 01:54:57.944
You can't just show up here

01:54:58.069 --> 01:55:02.522
and say things like that...
- I want to hurt anyone who causes you pain.

01:55:02.689 --> 01:55:04.021
I want to...

01:55:08.349 --> 01:55:11.096
I didn't know therapists make house calls.

01:55:14.884 --> 01:55:17.465
Please excuse me.
I shouldn't have come.

01:55:17.673 --> 01:55:19.088
I'm sorry.

01:55:19.546 --> 01:55:21.045
Good night.

01:55:51.054 --> 01:55:52.552
Can I help you?

01:55:53.385 --> 01:55:54.634
L.-

01:55:55.966 --> 01:55:58.005
You broke my door.

01:56:01.876 --> 01:56:03.749
What are you doing here?

01:56:05.872 --> 01:56:08.036
I'm Robert Linden's boyfriend.

01:56:32.801 --> 01:56:34.757
He was cremated this afternoon

01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:39.045
and is scheduled
to be shipped to the US tomorrow

01:56:39.252 --> 01:56:41.959
to be buried in the family grave.

01:56:51.906 --> 01:56:53.904
That is our prettiest urn.

01:57:02.727 --> 01:57:04.809
I think that is our prettiest...

01:57:08.014 --> 01:57:09.929
I should go.

01:57:14.507 --> 01:57:15.714
Mr. Bender.

01:57:19.626 --> 01:57:24.704
Did Mr. Linden
ever talk to you about his wishes?

01:57:49.095 --> 01:57:50.968
I want you to leave.

01:57:52.883 --> 01:57:54.631
I will miss you.

01:57:56.670 --> 01:57:58.252
Not enough.

01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:32.798
I did contemplate calling you first.

02:00:00.247 --> 02:00:03.827
I don't want to write books
I know he won't read.

02:00:07.156 --> 02:00:09.279
I bury people for a living.

02:00:09.446 --> 02:00:12.276
I have no idea what it means to write.

02:00:15.272 --> 02:00:17.270
I hardly remember myself.

02:00:24.846 --> 02:00:27.094
If you can't write for him anymore,

02:00:28.258 --> 02:00:30.465
maybe you can write about him.

02:01:44.719 --> 02:01:46.467
You have a gift, Mark.

02:01:57.872 --> 02:02:01.368
You might think it's a curse.
But it's a gift.

02:02:27.216 --> 02:02:29.214
I think I'm going home now.

02:02:32.793 --> 02:02:34.708
I think that's a good idea.

02:02:46.986 --> 02:02:48.776
Panama, come on.

02:04:27.878 --> 02:04:29.626
Can I have the check, please?

02:05:15.702 --> 02:05:18.117
Would you excuse me for a moment?
- Sure.
