WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:04.738
DAVID: When I was a boy,
I had all these expectations

00:04.772 --> 00:06.674
of what my adult life
would look like.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.410
My son and I playing catch
in the yard

00:09.443 --> 00:12.846
while my wife, Shannen Doherty
from 90210, brings us lemonade.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.849
You boys look like
you've worked up a manly thirst.

00:15.883 --> 00:18.086
BOTH:
Wow! Fresh-squeezed lemonade!

00:18.119 --> 00:19.487
Thanks, Mom.
Thanks, hon.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.089
(laughs)

00:21.122 --> 00:24.725
But expectations
and reality can wind up

00:24.758 --> 00:27.128
being two
very different things.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.000
You boys look like
you worked up a manly thirst.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.768
BOTH:
Wow. Fresh-squeezed lemonade.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.470
Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, hon.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.408
Even though I didn't end up
marrying Brenda Walsh

00:40.441 --> 00:42.243
and fell in love
with Bryan Collins instead,

00:42.276 --> 00:44.445
one constant has stayed
the same--

00:44.478 --> 00:46.714
I never stopped dreaming
of having a son.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.284
As an OB/GYN, all day long,

00:50.318 --> 00:52.886
I have the privilege
of telling expectant parents

00:52.920 --> 00:54.021
the gender of their child.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.056
It's a boy.

00:58.226 --> 01:01.195
The politically correct thing
for parents to say

01:01.229 --> 01:04.532
when asked if they prefer
to have a boy or a girl is,

01:04.565 --> 01:06.900
"We don't care as long
as it's healthy."

01:06.934 --> 01:08.736
It's a girl.

01:08.769 --> 01:12.072
But the thing is, deep down
inside, people do care.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.579
Everyone has a preference.

01:18.612 --> 01:21.882
Like me--
I have always wanted a boy.

01:21.915 --> 01:25.619
That's why
I collect World Series balls.

01:25.653 --> 01:28.289
Someday,
I'll pass them on to my son.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.791
My boy and I will love
our balls.

01:30.824 --> 01:34.628
We will take our balls out for
others to see and play with.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.664
BRYAN:
Guess what?

01:38.699 --> 01:39.900
I started making a list
of baby names.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.435
Oh, yeah? What you got?

01:41.469 --> 01:45.506
Solange, Hermes,
Veronique, Xandra.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.774
But those are all girls' names.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.008
Did you not hear me say Hermes?

01:48.041 --> 01:50.611
Sorry, it was all kind of a blur
after "Solange."

01:50.644 --> 01:51.812
(laughs)

01:51.845 --> 01:53.847
We don't even know
the baby's gender yet,

01:53.881 --> 01:55.249
so we have plenty of time.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.850
Are you glad we
chose not to find out?

01:56.884 --> 01:59.920
Absolutely. It's one of the last
real surprises in the world.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.855
And we will be thrilled
with whatever we have.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.891
BOTH:
As long as it's healthy.

02:11.665 --> 02:14.968
(whispers):
Sandra.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.107
So I guess you're kind of hoping
for a girl, huh?

02:20.140 --> 02:22.210
No. No, I'm okay
with whatever we have

02:22.243 --> 02:23.777
as long as she's healthy.
I just hate

02:23.811 --> 02:26.146
not knowing the gender while
we're decorating the nursery.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.649
It's very creatively
frustrating.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.550
Oh, well,
maybe we could

02:29.583 --> 02:31.285
help get your
creative juices flowing.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.153
Shania's working
on a project for school,

02:33.187 --> 02:34.222
and we could use your
help brainstorming.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.390
Oh.
I have
to give a presentation

02:36.424 --> 02:37.625
on an influential woman
in history.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.993
Mm-hmm, and we need
to decide quick

02:40.027 --> 02:41.395
so I can sew her
costume in time.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.163
Well, what have you been
thinking about so far?

02:43.197 --> 02:45.633
My mom thought I should go
as Susan B. Anthony

02:45.666 --> 02:48.135
or Marie Curie,
but I'm not feeling them.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.803
I want to explore a more
contemporary woman of note.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.138
I completely agree.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.241
Once you've been put
on a coin or discovered

02:53.274 --> 02:55.175
a radioactive isotope,
your 15 minutes are up.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.910
We'll put our heads
together, huh?

02:56.944 --> 03:01.148
But first, which one of
these wall decals goes best

03:01.181 --> 03:02.683
in this jaundice theme
I got going here?

03:02.716 --> 03:04.652
Silly monkey, silly froggy?

03:04.685 --> 03:05.653
(laughs):
Oh...

03:05.686 --> 03:07.988
Well, I think
they're both adorable.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.189
He'll love either one.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.492
He?

03:11.525 --> 03:12.893
Well, I see here
the parents don't want

03:12.926 --> 03:14.194
to know the gender of the child,

03:14.228 --> 03:15.763
but upon birth,

03:15.796 --> 03:16.997
they'll be very pleased to learn

03:17.030 --> 03:18.165
that he's of
the superior gender.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.767
(laughs)

03:19.800 --> 03:21.835
Congratulations!

03:21.869 --> 03:23.971
It's a boy!

03:27.541 --> 03:29.042
All right,
let's see what we got.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.044
Uh, first things first.
Uh-boom.

03:31.078 --> 03:35.283
Okay... Uh, hey, Bry,
you missed a good one today.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.850
I was on fire
from the three-point line.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.353
Oh, your smile and spirited
tone indicate that you won.

03:39.387 --> 03:40.888
Congratulations.
We need to talk.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.290
Come on.
Okay, all right.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.624
What's going on?

03:43.657 --> 03:45.526
Well, remember
how we decided

03:45.559 --> 03:47.194
not to find out
the gender of the baby?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.697
Well, let's just say
that Goldie, hormones raging,

03:49.730 --> 03:50.964
clearly not thinking,

03:50.998 --> 03:52.132
maybe accidentally
let the vagina

03:52.165 --> 03:53.567
or penis cat out of the bag.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.068
What are you saying?
You know what we're having?

03:55.102 --> 03:57.971
Would you, in this hypothetical
scenario, want to know?

03:58.005 --> 04:00.173
No. No way.
It's the last...
It's a boy.

04:01.609 --> 04:02.910
Are you mad that I told you?

04:02.943 --> 04:06.079
Mad. No.
I'm... I'm not mad.

04:06.113 --> 04:09.249
I'm... so happy.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.885
We're having a boy.
We're having a boy!

04:11.919 --> 04:14.154
Oh, I know. My instinct was
to lift something, too.

04:14.187 --> 04:16.490
You guys, we're having a boy!

04:16.524 --> 04:20.093
(cheering,
whooping, laughing)

04:20.127 --> 04:21.094
Yes.
Come on.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.596
Yeah! Yeah!
Come on.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.564
(roaring)

04:23.597 --> 04:25.065
Oh, my God, it is so weird!

04:25.098 --> 04:26.667
Just last week,
I was online

04:26.700 --> 04:28.001
looking at jungle gym forts,

04:28.035 --> 04:30.237
and I totally bookmarked,
like, ten of them, right?

04:30.270 --> 04:31.405
And now we can get one,

04:31.439 --> 04:32.906
and get rid of that stupid
Mexican birdbath!

04:32.940 --> 04:35.108
Oh, actually, that's a vintage
Monterey-tiled fountain

04:35.142 --> 04:36.677
with a slumbering
Latino garden figure.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.946
Oh, my God, and my old
Encyclopedia Brown books!

04:38.979 --> 04:40.448
You know the ones
where he solves mysteries?

04:40.481 --> 04:41.782
And light saber fights!

04:41.815 --> 04:44.084
We can totally have
broom light saber fights!

04:44.117 --> 04:46.787
(imitating light sabers
whooshing, buzzing)

04:46.820 --> 04:49.289
(as Darth Vader):
David, you are a father.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.359
(laughs)
Oh, dude,

04:51.392 --> 04:52.926
you can totally sign him up
for pee-wee football.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.127
My boys do it.
They're great!

04:54.161 --> 04:56.096
In fact, you can come
to our league game this weekend.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.432
I'm coaching.
No-- I-I could coach?
They'd let me coach?

04:58.466 --> 04:59.433
Yeah.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.601
Of course they'd let me coach

05:00.634 --> 05:01.635
because I'm having a boy.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.604
I'm having a boy! Ah!

05:03.637 --> 05:05.205
Hmm.
(smooching)

05:05.238 --> 05:06.940
Oh, yeah.
Good job, bro.

05:06.974 --> 05:07.941
Up top.
Yes. Up top.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.276
Yeah, get in here.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.678
Hugging, too!
Yeah, come on,
get in on it.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.446
Come on, big daddy.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.647
Yes, you did.
So happy!

05:13.681 --> 05:16.149
Yes, you did, big dawg.
Yes, you did, big dawg.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.690
During my marriage
to Abraham Lincoln,

05:22.723 --> 05:26.293
I suffered from spinal pain,
boils and hallucinations.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.229
So does Ke$ha, but at least
she has fun outfits.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.465
Bryan, thank you for
putting so much effort

05:31.499 --> 05:33.133
in Shania's presentation.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.469
It's important-- this is
a big part of her grade.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.904
Well, I'd love
to take all the credit,

05:36.937 --> 05:39.306
but you're the one who sewed
a spectacular costume.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.841
You're really
very talented, Goldie.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.075
Oh, no.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.811
GIRL: That is why,
to this day,

05:43.844 --> 05:48.148
I, Mary Todd Lincoln,
am an influential woman.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.683
(applause)

05:53.554 --> 05:54.655
Thank you, Fawn.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.257
Our next presentation
is by Shania Clemmons.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.759
Whoo!

06:00.127 --> 06:03.431
SHANIA:
Does anyone here believe?

06:03.464 --> 06:05.499
Thank you, thank you.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.501
Thank you, babe. Whoo!

06:07.535 --> 06:08.368
Whoo!

06:08.402 --> 06:13.006
(pop intro playing)

06:13.040 --> 06:14.542
My name is Cher.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.679
This is my band,

06:18.712 --> 06:21.515
the Mondale Elementary School
Jazz Explosion.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.016
Many of you know me

06:23.050 --> 06:24.885
from my five decades
of hit songs,

06:24.918 --> 06:26.854
my great movies like Burlesque,

06:26.887 --> 06:28.522
and my insane 4:00 a.m. tweets

06:28.556 --> 06:30.190
about politics
or wig-maintenance.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.192
But let's turn back time
to when I was a little girl

06:32.225 --> 06:36.063
in El Centro, California,
named Cherilyn Sarkisian.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.598
I didn't expect much from life.

06:37.631 --> 06:38.866
But I wanted more.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.134
I wanted my dreams to come true.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.103
I wanted to sing.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.371
I sang for everyone,

06:44.404 --> 06:46.874
be they man, woman,

06:46.907 --> 06:50.243
straight, gay,
but mostly gay men.

06:50.277 --> 06:54.381
* My father married
a pure Cherokee *

06:54.414 --> 06:55.716
* Cherokee *

06:55.749 --> 06:58.719
* My mother's people were
ashamed of me *

06:58.752 --> 07:00.053
* Ashamed of me *

07:00.087 --> 07:03.491
* The Indians said
that I was white by law *

07:03.524 --> 07:04.592
* White by law *

07:04.625 --> 07:05.759
* The White Man

07:05.793 --> 07:09.362
* Always called me
Indian Squaw... *

07:10.931 --> 07:12.600
* Half-breed

07:12.633 --> 07:15.268
* That's all I ever heard

07:15.302 --> 07:16.937
* Half-breed

07:16.970 --> 07:19.907
* How I learned
to hate the word *

07:19.940 --> 07:21.575
* Half-breed

07:21.609 --> 07:24.745
* She's no good they warned

07:24.778 --> 07:27.080
* Both sides were against me

07:27.114 --> 07:30.751
* Since the day I was born!

07:30.784 --> 07:31.685
(song ends)

07:31.719 --> 07:33.086
Whoo!
Whoo!

07:33.120 --> 07:34.522
(applause)

07:36.156 --> 07:37.257
Great job!
We love you!

07:37.290 --> 07:38.526
GOLDIE:
Whoo!

07:38.559 --> 07:39.927
She's totally gonna win.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.461
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

07:41.495 --> 07:43.263
(whistle blowing)

07:43.296 --> 07:44.798
All right, Spartans, let's go.

07:44.832 --> 07:45.866
Let's go defense.

07:46.967 --> 07:47.635
You got it!

07:47.668 --> 07:49.603
Yeah! Good job,

07:49.637 --> 07:51.104
defense!

07:51.138 --> 07:52.305
Good D, good D.

07:52.339 --> 07:53.974
Hey, Sammy,

07:54.007 --> 07:55.375
you're a linebacker, all right?

07:55.408 --> 07:56.510
You got to shadow
that running back.

07:56.544 --> 07:57.611
Help out your safeties.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.046
Okay, get in there.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.280
Let's go, defense.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.782
You sound like a man
who's enjoying himself.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.816
Oh, I'm loving it.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.217
Thank you for letting me
coach this week.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.318
Hey, it's good practice

08:05.352 --> 08:06.954
for when your little guy
is ready to play.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.789
I might even get a windbreaker,
and gain 50 pounds.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.991
(whistle blows)
All right, let's
get in there. Good D.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.460
Hold 'em down.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.295
Here we go.
Hold 'em down, come on!

08:15.328 --> 08:16.163
Take him down!

08:16.196 --> 08:17.297
Take him down!

08:17.330 --> 08:18.999
Good tackle!

08:19.032 --> 08:20.067
(whistle blows)

08:20.100 --> 08:21.334
How long do these games last?

08:21.368 --> 08:23.003
Usually an entire bottle
of wine.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.137
They're brutal.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.505
We sit out here
for two hours

08:25.539 --> 08:27.174
every weekend,
baking in the heat,

08:27.207 --> 08:28.909
letting the sun fry up
our collagen.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.143
Give me
a bank-account busting trip

08:30.177 --> 08:32.312
to the American Girl doll
store any day.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.315
Oh, my God, I just got Finley
the cutest pink leg braces

08:35.348 --> 08:37.985
for her differently-abled doll.
Is it true that they
have a little salon there

08:38.018 --> 08:40.153
where the girls and the dolls
get their hair done in tandem?

08:40.187 --> 08:43.256
Is it mandatory that I bring
an actual daughter to get in?

08:43.290 --> 08:44.592
(women laughing)

08:45.626 --> 08:47.494
(whistle blows)
DAVID:
Let's go, defense!

08:47.527 --> 08:48.495
There you go.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.863
Crush it, come on!

08:49.897 --> 08:51.064
Come on!

08:51.098 --> 08:53.000
All right, guys,
that's how you do it!

08:53.033 --> 08:54.234
Good hustle, guys.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.703
I want to coach.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.204
Huh? Is everything
all right, Bry?

08:57.237 --> 08:58.338
Did you finish your magazines?

08:58.371 --> 08:59.740
Yeah, I want to coach.
I want to yell.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.408
I want to clap.
I want to get people excited.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.943
Besides, I can only take
so much conversation

09:02.976 --> 09:04.612
about suburban infidelity
and Greek yogurt.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.214
David, we're having a boy and I
want to participate in his life.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.882
But, Bry, you don't know
anything about football.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.417
Pfft! Of course I do.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.919
Watch and marvel.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.086
(whistles)
Oh, my God.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.622
Let's clump together, boys.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.690
Clump together.
Let's clump together.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.025
All right, it's a little rude
if I can't see your eyes.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.026
Everyone take off your hats.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.360
Uh, they're helmets.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.229
They're for safety.
I got this, David.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.864
Okay, okay.
I am Coach Bryan,

09:23.897 --> 09:25.866
Coach David's understudy.
I know,

09:25.899 --> 09:27.868
a lot of coaches here today,
but we all have one goal:

09:27.901 --> 09:31.538
to run and push
and score more points, right?

09:31.571 --> 09:32.640
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah!

09:32.673 --> 09:34.241
So let's cuddle up!

09:34.274 --> 09:35.643
Should one of us get in there

09:35.676 --> 09:37.110
and give him a hand?
Uh, no, no, no.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.245
He's all right.
L-Let him do it.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.780
Does everybody know their parts?

09:39.813 --> 09:40.948
ALL:
Yeah!

09:40.981 --> 09:42.115
All right, let's get out there,

09:42.149 --> 09:43.216
and let's break a leg!

09:43.250 --> 09:44.217
ALL:
Yeah!

09:44.251 --> 09:45.953
Break a leg!

09:45.986 --> 09:47.587
That's a euphemism!

09:47.621 --> 09:49.389
(whistle blows)

09:49.422 --> 09:50.724
I haven't run on grass
in so long.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.160
I forget how squishy it is.
Yeah.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.161
So, what did you tell them?

09:54.194 --> 09:55.663
I just added a twist.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.698
(quarterback yells out play)

10:00.433 --> 10:01.935
Two balls?
Where did that come from?

10:01.969 --> 10:03.336
Look, check out
the other runner.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.738
BRYAN:
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

10:04.772 --> 10:05.572
No, wait.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.174
And there they go.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.610
Oh, oh...

10:10.644 --> 10:12.780
(whistle blows)

10:13.781 --> 10:15.415
(whistle blows)

10:15.448 --> 10:17.417
They scored
two touchdowns?

10:17.450 --> 10:18.752
Okay, so "Secret Ball"

10:18.786 --> 10:20.253
didn't work this time, boys,

10:20.287 --> 10:21.621
but nice effort.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.925
It was a good try, Bryan.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.860
The kids are gonna...

10:26.894 --> 10:29.429
remember this day.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.131
Come on, guys.

10:33.734 --> 10:37.137
Hey, Bryan, Kate and I
are gonna go grab some coffee.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.239
Would you mind
watching our purses?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.242
(whistle blows)

10:48.916 --> 10:50.450
(humming)

10:50.483 --> 10:51.685
Hey, honey.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.620
I'm making curtains
for the baby's room.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.122
I decided to go
with solid blue.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.323
I was gonna do a pattern

10:56.356 --> 10:58.558
with little bicycles,
but, you know,

10:58.591 --> 10:59.793
Lance Armstrong.

10:59.827 --> 11:00.493
Whatever, Mom.

11:00.527 --> 11:02.129
What's wrong?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.396
Guess what grade I got

11:03.430 --> 11:05.132
on my "Influential Women
in History" presentation.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.834
Go ahead, guess.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.068
A...

11:08.101 --> 11:09.636
Minus?
Try F.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.838
F?!
And suspended for:

11:10.871 --> 11:13.640
"violating the school's
policy on hate speech."

11:13.673 --> 11:14.641
Hate speech?!

11:14.674 --> 11:16.143
What are you talking about?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.978
The song that I song
is called "Half-Breed."

11:18.011 --> 11:19.412
Yeah, but that's
what the song is about--

11:19.446 --> 11:21.081
that it's offensive
to be called a half-breed.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.850
I know-- they said
it doesn't matter

11:22.883 --> 11:25.485
because the school has
a "Zero Tolerance" policy.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.355
But "Zero Tolerance" can't mean
absolutely no exceptions.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.923
That's kind of exactly
what it means.

11:29.957 --> 11:30.991
Well, I don't care.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.592
It was wrong
to suspend you for this.

11:32.625 --> 11:33.593
And you know what?

11:33.626 --> 11:35.195
I'm gonna fight it.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.767
If I expect to be
a lawyer someday,

11:39.800 --> 11:41.268
I may as well practice
right now.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.170
Your lawyer suit?
Will it fit?

11:43.203 --> 11:44.838
David and Bryan
gave that to you

11:44.872 --> 11:46.339
when you weren't
even a week pregnant.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.507
Well, I'm gonna make some

11:47.540 --> 11:49.342
quick alterations today,
and tomorrow

11:49.376 --> 11:51.078
we're gonna go down to
that school to show them

11:51.111 --> 11:53.680
that they can't mess
with a daughter of a woman

11:53.713 --> 11:56.850
who dreams of someday maybe
trying to become a lawyer.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.852
Not your most
inspiring speech,

11:58.886 --> 12:00.220
but I love your passion.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.191
(sighs)

12:04.224 --> 12:06.226
Okay.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.029
What is all this?

12:09.062 --> 12:11.198
Oh, they're the curtains
that Goldie made.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.565
Aren't they great?

12:12.599 --> 12:14.234
I figured since we know
we're having a boy,

12:14.267 --> 12:15.869
we don't have to go
gender-neutral anymore.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.204
We can add some
male flourishes.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.039
Oh, look.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.240
Baseballs.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.475
Each one of them from
an actual World Series.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.544
I've been collecting them
since I was a kid.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.146
Oh, why didn't
you say so, David?

12:26.179 --> 12:28.148
They're old used balls.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.249
That changes everything.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.383
Look, David, as innovative

12:30.417 --> 12:32.052
as the color blue
and sporting goods are

12:32.085 --> 12:34.287
for a boy's room,
they just sort of

12:34.321 --> 12:36.423
mar my overall
design scheme, so...

12:36.456 --> 12:40.060
Bryan, my glove from when
I was in Little League.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.761
I've been keeping it
oiled for my son.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.330
David, if we did
the room your way,

12:43.363 --> 12:45.165
the only thing new in here
would be the baby.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.800
It's just one shelf.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.902
We'll still have plenty of room
for your precious design.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.770
Precious--
you mean "girly"?

12:50.804 --> 12:53.273
Look, you're not the only one
who had expectations, okay?

12:53.306 --> 12:54.908
I mean, what if we had a girl?

12:54.942 --> 12:57.177
What-what would you do with
your male flourishes then?

12:57.210 --> 12:58.745
Why are you getting so upset?

12:58.778 --> 13:02.249
I want our baby to love me
as much as he loves you.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.451
And I'm afraid he's only
gonna be into the things

13:04.484 --> 13:06.019
that you're into,
and then we won't be able

13:06.053 --> 13:07.287
to relate on anything at all.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.190
I'm his dad, too, David, and I
don't want him calling me "Mom,"

13:10.223 --> 13:12.425
or "Lady Dad"
or "Auntie Bry Bry."

13:12.459 --> 13:14.862
Why would our son call
you "Auntie Bry Bry"?

13:14.895 --> 13:17.264
I don't want it to be like it is
with you and the dogs.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.598
Okay?

13:18.631 --> 13:20.800
They run to you and they play
with you, but they ignore me.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.936
The dogs run to me
because I feed them.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.604
They look at me
as a giant sack

13:24.637 --> 13:26.974
of treats who throws a ball.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.876
Kind of like the way
you look at me.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.944
David, stop--
I appreciate your attempt

13:30.978 --> 13:34.948
at flirty glibness right now,
but this is very real for me.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.384
I had four jock brothers
and a sister

13:37.417 --> 13:38.886
who petitioned
to play linebacker.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.621
My dad didn't know how
to relate to me at all.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.191
And the only time he spoke to me
was for TV listings

13:44.224 --> 13:46.626
because I had memorized the
TV Guide from cover to cover.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.862
So if I hadn't know that
Remington Steele was on

13:48.896 --> 13:51.198
at 10:00 p.m. on Tuesdays...
(sniffs)

13:51.231 --> 13:54.167
well, then we wouldn't have had
two words to say to each other.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.302
I want to have
the same connection

13:55.335 --> 13:56.569
that you have with our child,

13:56.603 --> 13:58.305
but I'm afraid.
I know.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.308
I don't want to be
the odd man out again, David.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.010
Not with our own child.

14:04.711 --> 14:05.913
Wait a minute... Bry?

14:10.117 --> 14:11.151
(clears throat)

14:11.184 --> 14:12.652
Mr. Blakeney, Your Honor,

14:12.685 --> 14:14.754
if it please the... the you,

14:14.787 --> 14:17.257
I would like to begin
by reviewing the circumstances

14:17.290 --> 14:19.026
which lead to
my daughter Shania's

14:19.059 --> 14:20.727
recent suspension.

14:20.760 --> 14:21.929
Ms. Clemmons,
please, sit down.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.663
Really, you don't have
to be so formal.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.333
The class assignment,
if I am correct,

14:26.366 --> 14:27.500
was to, quote, "prepare

14:27.534 --> 14:28.936
"a presentation of no more than

14:28.969 --> 14:32.405
ten minutes on a female subject,
who" quote, "stands out as a,"

14:32.439 --> 14:34.541
quote, "influential figure
in history."

14:34.574 --> 14:36.843
End quote.
End quote.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.778
I believe my daughter's
presentation was successfully

14:38.811 --> 14:40.213
executed on all counts.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.449
"Executed" is good
in this instance.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.583
Nobody's questioning
the significance

14:43.616 --> 14:45.452
of Cher's impact on culture

14:45.485 --> 14:47.187
we're simply objecting to
your daughter's song choice.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.057
I mean, Cher has
a voluminous catalog

14:50.090 --> 14:52.192
of other perfectly
appropriate songs.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.560
"If I Could
Turn Back Time."

14:53.593 --> 14:54.694
"I Got You, Babe."

14:54.727 --> 14:55.728
"The Beat Goes On."

14:55.762 --> 14:57.364
"Gypsies, Tramps,
and Thieves."
Well...

14:57.397 --> 14:59.699
she may be suspended for that
one, I'd have to check the book.

14:59.732 --> 15:03.036
I don't get it-- why can't you
look past the rule on this one?

15:03.070 --> 15:05.038
The spirit
of Shania's presentation

15:05.072 --> 15:07.040
was that a women
of simple means can grow up

15:07.074 --> 15:08.641
to become a role model
to millions.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.543
She's inspirational.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.145
When I was watching

15:12.179 --> 15:13.380
her portrayal
of Ms. Cher, I thought

15:13.413 --> 15:16.483
I am capable of so much more
than people expect of me,

15:16.516 --> 15:19.719
and if one other student
had that same thought,

15:19.752 --> 15:21.888
well, wasn't my client's
performance worth it?

15:21.921 --> 15:22.889
No one's arguing that.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.924
We're simply stating that,
based on our policy,

15:24.958 --> 15:27.427
you may not use a pejorative
like that on school ground.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.062
Permission to have
that word defined.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.999
It means "derogatory."
Permission to have
that word defined.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.901
I'm sorry, Ms. Clemmons, you
make a very moving argument,

15:34.934 --> 15:38.338
but when it comes to rules,
feelings don't matter.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.872
The law is the law.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.611
Okay, I have no idea
why I did that.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.756
Hey.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.026
Oh, look at you all lawyery.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.661
Were you able to get Shania's
suspension overturned?

16:01.694 --> 16:03.096
No, it was
a complete failure.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.165
I am a complete failure.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.367
Being a lawyer isn't my thing.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.536
You know my kid
has a better vision

16:09.569 --> 16:12.605
of what she wants to be
than I do.
Oh, don't say that, Goldie.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.375
You can do anything
you put your mind to.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.844
No, it's not that I don't
think I can be a lawyer,

16:17.877 --> 16:20.380
it's that I don't want to be.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.649
I mean, even if I'm arguing
for all that's good and right,

16:22.682 --> 16:24.384
an innocent person
can still be punished.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.885
And if that's what
being a lawyer means,

16:25.918 --> 16:29.122
then I need to find myself
another dream.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.324
Life just isn't turning out
how I expected it.

16:31.358 --> 16:32.725
I know what you mean.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.661
This whole having a boy thing
has thrown me for a loop.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.396
Bryan, listen...

16:36.429 --> 16:39.732
you are going to be an amazing
dad, no matter what the gender.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.634
I just don't want it to be
like it was with my dad.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.071
He was all, "Socket wrench,
Sports Illustrated,

16:44.104 --> 16:45.538
poker night, 'Pull my finger.'"

16:45.572 --> 16:48.175
And I was all, "talent show,
pep squad, 'Guess who got cast

16:48.208 --> 16:50.477
as Mortimer Brewster
in Arsenic and Old Lace?'"

16:50.510 --> 16:52.179
I made a fool out of myself
on that football court.

16:52.212 --> 16:52.812
Field.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.382
(phone rings)

16:55.415 --> 16:56.416
It's David.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.051
Great, his football game
got rained out,

16:58.085 --> 17:00.087
and now he wants to bring
the whole team here.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.421
Wants me to order pizza.

17:01.454 --> 17:04.091
I mean, I don't know what
a bunch of boys want.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.024
Aren't you a boy?

17:05.058 --> 17:06.359
Yes, but not that kind.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.528
Ugh... I'm gonna be
outnumbered in my own home.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.563
Forever.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.101
All right, let's go, guys.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.836
Come on in-- shoes off,
don't touch the walls.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.538
FREDDIE:
All right, okay.

17:18.571 --> 17:19.939
All right, guys...

17:19.972 --> 17:21.341
AMIR: Ethan, give
Donny's inhaler back!

17:21.374 --> 17:23.343
(boys laughing, clamoring)

17:23.376 --> 17:25.112
Cool!
That's crazy!

17:25.145 --> 17:27.847
Thank God we didn't have to
go to Chuck E. Cheese again.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.117
If I had to listen to that
animatronic band one more time,

17:30.150 --> 17:31.584
I was going to beat
that purple bear

17:31.618 --> 17:33.586
to death with his own bongos.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.188
Well, lower
your expectations.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.124
I only had an hour-- I barely
had time to do a centerpiece,

17:37.157 --> 17:39.926
let alone an entire luncheon
for the Bad Time Bears.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.128
(laughs)

17:41.161 --> 17:42.529
All right, boys, lunch!

17:42.562 --> 17:43.896
(boys clamoring)
Come on, boys.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.298
Come on over.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.400
Okay, so, what
we're gonna do here

17:47.434 --> 17:48.801
is a make-your-own-pizza party.

17:48.835 --> 17:49.902
BOYS: Whoa!
Wha-what!

17:49.936 --> 17:51.138
BOY: Yeah!

17:51.171 --> 17:52.872
All right, I even got
you some chef's hats.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.742
A hat for you and there's a hat
for you, there's more here.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.144
There we go.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.146
Now, these toppings are probably
a little bit different

17:59.179 --> 18:00.913
than you're used to, but it's
all we had in the house,

18:00.947 --> 18:02.115
so we got two kinds of ham,

18:02.149 --> 18:03.250
we have a prosciutto
and Iberico.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.485
We also have some truffles,
we have some

18:05.518 --> 18:07.820
squash blossoms
and roasted poblanos,

18:07.854 --> 18:09.322
we have some fresh burrata--
so what you do

18:09.356 --> 18:10.823
is you take a bowl of dough--

18:10.857 --> 18:12.225
now, I've had this dough
in my freezer

18:12.259 --> 18:13.993
for that dinner party I was
gonna throw for Kristen Stewart

18:14.026 --> 18:15.595
when I was trying
to woo her on to my show,

18:15.628 --> 18:17.830
but then I found out
she's gluten-free...

18:17.864 --> 18:18.831
and joy-free.

18:18.865 --> 18:19.899
(boys laugh)

18:19.932 --> 18:21.334
So take this dough

18:21.368 --> 18:22.902
over to the kneading station,
roll it out,

18:22.935 --> 18:24.804
and then come back and get some
toppings and we'll cook it up.

18:24.837 --> 18:25.838
What do you think?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.407
BOYS: Yeah!
Yes, let's do it.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.409
Dough.
Take a dough.
There it is.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.244
Oh, you're even lining up
like little gentlemen.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.346
There's more over there,
there's more over there.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.648
You put all of this
together in an hour?

18:35.682 --> 18:37.650
Well, 40 minutes-- I spent the
rest of the time on the phone,

18:37.684 --> 18:39.519
trying to get those video games
from the studio.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.521
Wait your turn, dude.
Dude, I just...

18:41.554 --> 18:43.623
BRYAN: We had them for the all
'80s episode of Sing!

18:43.656 --> 18:44.924
I don't know, I thought
the kids would like 'em.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.126
Coach Bryan?
Mm-hmm.

18:47.160 --> 18:51.130
This isn't the kind of ham
my dad buys-- I like it!

18:51.164 --> 18:54.601
Way better than that block
of pink we usually eat.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.035
DAVID: Everything
all right, Donny?

18:56.068 --> 18:58.271
Yeah, just... about
the scrimmage the other day...?

18:58.305 --> 18:59.706
Oh, well, you know what,
that was my fault.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.541
I never should have
tried to coach.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.875
No, I was gonna say

19:02.909 --> 19:04.477
Coach Freddie
usually gets

19:04.511 --> 19:06.846
stressed-out and competitive
and kind of yells at us,

19:06.879 --> 19:09.216
but you were fun and cool.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.717
Don't tell Coach Freddie
I said that.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.886
He's my dad-- it'll turn
into a whole thing.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.224
And you thought you wouldn't
be able to relate to boys.

19:17.257 --> 19:20.227
Well, kids will say anything
if there's free pizza.
Bryan, look at them.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.730
They're having fun,
they're learning new things.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.398
This is not the work of a man

19:25.432 --> 19:27.300
that doesn't know how
to connect to boys.

19:27.334 --> 19:30.002
You know, you don't have to be
scared about not relating to

19:30.036 --> 19:32.339
your son just because your dad
didn't know what to do
with a boy like you.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.241
You're already a
better dad than he was.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.810
Because you're trying.

19:37.844 --> 19:41.814
Our son is very lucky because he
is going to have an awesome dad.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.916
Me.
Me.

19:46.118 --> 19:47.887
Thank you.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.757
Okay, so the next step
is to cook it.

19:50.790 --> 19:54.060
This is, uh, well,
this will never cook,

19:54.093 --> 19:56.496
but, uh, we can try it.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.764
We can certainly try it.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.699
Let's just jack up
the oven here.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.868
DAVID:
Expectations are a funny thing.

20:01.901 --> 20:06.038
You waste so much time
guessing what your life could
look like.

20:06.072 --> 20:11.010
But the thing is you can't
really know until the day

20:11.043 --> 20:13.713
you open your eyes and see...

20:42.342 --> 20:46.779
...that if you let go and
lean into the unexpected,

20:46.813 --> 20:49.616
it may be something
more beautiful

20:49.649 --> 20:51.418
than you ever
could've imagined.

21:15.542 --> 21:23.516
No, it's not what you expected,
it's something even better.
