<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>Michael Bluth arrived at work...</i>

00:22.055 --> 00:25.024

00:25.125 --> 00:28.185
What have you got there?
"Don't be afraid to make a mi-"

00:30.430 --> 00:32.557
I'm not gonna
beat myself up over that.

00:32.665 --> 00:36.362
Oh. It works. So, I wrote your "Message from
the President" on the shareholders' statement.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.369
Starla's making copies.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.769
Did I tell you that she'd make
a great secretary?

00:40.874 --> 00:43.035
Yeah. I'm not so sure that
hiring her wasn't a mistake.

00:43.143 --> 00:47.443
And I'm not afraid to make mistakes.
Or have you forgotten this little- Damn it!

00:47.547 --> 00:50.675
- My legs are so powerful.
- So I thought you might want to read it...

00:50.784 --> 00:52.684
seeing as how you are
the president now...

00:52.786 --> 00:56.449
- even though it's just a title.
- Uh, right. Yes, well...

00:56.556 --> 00:59.024
we should "circumvrent"
union penalties.

00:59.125 --> 01:01.992
- "Circumverate."
- Circumvent. Circumvent. Means to go around.

01:02.095 --> 01:03.824
The old reach around.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.194
Trust me. This makes you
look like a leader. Okay?

01:06.299 --> 01:08.961
I don't think that
I need any help with that.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.236
[Bleeps] it.
Just leave it where it is.

01:13.339 --> 01:16.308
- Now, if you just flip-
- Here are the copies.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.572
Hey. These are-
These are very small.

01:19.679 --> 01:22.170
When you said you wanted
photocopies...

01:22.282 --> 01:25.217
I thought that you meant you
wanted them on a photo printer.

01:25.318 --> 01:28.515
Tell you what. From now on,
we're gonna use just the big printer.

01:28.621 --> 01:31.215
Okay. You're a perfectionist.

01:31.324 --> 01:33.224
Flashes of Quincy.

01:33.326 --> 01:37.422
<i>[Narrator] Starla claimed to have had</i>
<i>a relationship with music legend QuincyJones.</i>

01:37.530 --> 01:40.658
Mr. President, I'm gonna go look into
some LEGOLAND tickets for the weekend.

01:40.767 --> 01:44.567
- Cool. Let's do it.
- Actually, I just meant me and my son.

01:44.671 --> 01:46.400
Isn't he a little old
for that?

01:46.506 --> 01:49.168
No. Sorry.
I've been looking...

01:49.275 --> 01:52.938
to get some alone time with him,
and it just hasn't seemed to work out lately.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.207
No problem. I'll just call up
some of my friends.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.911
- What?
- What friends?

02:00.019 --> 02:03.182
I've got friends, Michael.
I just don't talk to them because...

02:03.289 --> 02:06.053
I work all the time.

02:10.530 --> 02:14.057
I think the plant lady's
wearing a thong.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.658
<i>Michael, this is</i>
<i>your office now?</i>

02:16.769 --> 02:18.669
Yeah. Well, it's temporary.

02:18.771 --> 02:20.739
We gotta make sure Gob
looks like he's in charge.

02:20.840 --> 02:24.537
Oh. Please. Allow me.
I'll just "circumvrent" you.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.135
<i>Let's make sure we don't</i>
<i>give him any real power.</i>

02:27.247 --> 02:31.741
- Mmm.
- So, I gotta a call today from
Gene Parmesan, our private eye.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.786
- He said he found something big.
- We have a private eye, huh?

02:34.888 --> 02:38.449
Oh, I hired him a hundred years ago to find out
if your father was cheating on me.

02:38.558 --> 02:42.289
- He never did find anything.
- Well, he can't be very good then.

02:42.395 --> 02:44.955
- What did he find?
- He said he wanted to tell us in person.

02:45.064 --> 02:47.555
[Italian Accent]
Don't get up. I just a-find-a the supplies...

02:47.667 --> 02:50.101
because I'm a- [Drops Accent]
Private detective.

02:50.203 --> 02:52.569
Gene Parmesan.
How are you doing?

02:52.672 --> 02:54.936
[Shrieks]
Gene! Oh, Gene!

02:55.041 --> 02:57.908
- Isn't he the best?
- <i>[Narrator] Gene was far from the best.</i>

02:58.011 --> 02:59.911
- Very impressive.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

03:00.013 --> 03:02.311
- What did you find?
- Oh, nothing.

03:02.415 --> 03:05.248
- Just your father's getaway car.
- You're kidding.

03:05.351 --> 03:09.515
<i>[Narrator] Michael's father had used</i>
<i>the family stairway vehicle to escape from prison.</i>

03:09.622 --> 03:12.523
If I could find Dad, I'd be off the hook.
I could be president again.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.423
- Where is it?
- Mexico.

03:15.528 --> 03:18.759
You get the country for free.
The city-That's gonna cost ya.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.266
<i>[Beeping]</i>

03:22.368 --> 03:24.928
- It's a $200 fine.
- Oh!

03:25.038 --> 03:27.302
I feel like such an-
[Bleeps]

03:27.407 --> 03:29.307
The car is in
a town called Encanta.

03:29.409 --> 03:32.207
If you think that's worth more than $200,
I'd really appreciate it.

03:32.312 --> 03:34.610
- All right. Here.
- I'm not even gonna count it.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.946
You can leave tomorrow
after my going-away party for Buster.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.612
I still can't believe
he's going into the army.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.621
You know, he's doing it
just to spite me.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.283
- Then why are you throwing him a party?
- Just to spite him.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.223
You guys have such
a healthy thing going.

03:48.328 --> 03:50.853
Okay, I'll go to your party,
and then I'll go to Mexico.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.865
- I guess that'll be my quality time with my son.
- Mexico?

03:53.967 --> 03:58.301
- Yeah. Mom's P.I. Found the stair car down there.
- Gene Parmesan?

03:58.404 --> 04:01.498
- Right here.
- [Shrieks]

04:01.608 --> 04:04.133
I counted it. Come on.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.235
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And that's when Gob became suspicious...</i>

04:06.346 --> 04:10.476
<i>that Michael had only made him president</i>
<i>to stick him with the failing business...</i>

04:10.583 --> 04:14.383
<i>while Michael himself</i>
<i>escaped to Mexico to be with his father.</i>

04:14.487 --> 04:18.355
- <i>So, inspired by his mother's private detective</i>- 
- <i>[Gob] "Ice."</i>

04:18.458 --> 04:21.552
<i>He decided to hire someone</i>
<i>to keep an eye on his brother.</i>

04:21.661 --> 04:25.825
I think I might have someone
who's going to "cirsumvrent" the law.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.924
<i>[Narrator] And Michael returned home,</i>
<i>eager to tell his son of their trip.</i>

04:29.035 --> 04:31.230
George Michael,
what say you and I take a road trip...

04:31.337 --> 04:33.999
down to Mexico tomorrow
right after Buster's party?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.701
- Oh, I can't. I'm meeting Ann.
- Who?

04:36.809 --> 04:39.437
Ann. Here. You took
this picture of us...

04:39.545 --> 04:42.446
in front of that bagel place
before it was burned down.

04:42.548 --> 04:45.108
I guess I thought
she was with another family.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.686
She's kind of my girlfriend.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.051
- Her?
- Do you not like her?

04:50.156 --> 04:52.852
I don't know her.
It's like you spend all your time with her.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.292
It's like you're hoggin' her-
like you're a little Ann hog.

04:56.396 --> 04:59.297
Okay? Don't be such an Ann hog.
But we're gonna go to Mexico.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.367
Try to find Pop-Pop.
It'll be an adventure.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.401
Well-

05:03.503 --> 05:06.597
And 8:01. Curtain has risen.
[Chuckles]

05:06.706 --> 05:10.802
Hey, Tobias, I was wondering if you were
available tomorrow to go down to Mexico.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.640
- I need two drivers.
- Alas, I have two shows tomorrow...

05:13.746 --> 05:15.805
<i>where I'm on standby</i>
<i>for the Blue Man Group.</i>

05:15.915 --> 05:20.215
Might as well keep this makeup on
since it takes so- [Bleeps] long to get off.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.220
Hmm. Lindsay, what about you?

05:22.322 --> 05:25.052
Uh, can't. I have
a big date tomorrow.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.150
You know, this open marriage is ridiculous.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

05:28.261 --> 05:31.526
The important thing is
that you guys don't lose focus on yourselves.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.058
First of all,
we are doing this for her.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.831
Okay? Because neither one of us
wants to get divorced.

05:38.938 --> 05:42.135
<i>And "second-of-ly,"</i>
<i>I know you're the big marriage expert</i>- 

05:42.241 --> 05:47.269
Oh. I'm sorry. I forgot. Your wife is dead.
[Chuckles]

05:50.283 --> 05:54.583
I'm sorry. That was 100% inappropriate,
and I do apologize profusely.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.588
I'm- Oh.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.749
Okay, look. I don't
have a date tomorrow.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.759
But why can't you ask
Gob to go with you?

06:01.861 --> 06:04.489
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Michael and Gob had been to Mexico once before.</i>

06:04.597 --> 06:07.589
- Chiclet? Chiclet?
- You're the Chiclet! Not me!

06:07.700 --> 06:09.827
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Unfortunately, in Mexican culture...</i>

06:09.936 --> 06:12.837
<i>this was a much more</i>
<i>inflammatory gesture.</i>

06:20.646 --> 06:23.046
- [Clucking]
- Hey, hey.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.845
<i>I just think you and I would have</i>
<i>a lot more fun.</i>

06:25.952 --> 06:28.921
- Plus you can bring Maeby.
- You know, I've sensed her...

06:29.021 --> 06:31.717
feeling a little
left out lately.

06:31.824 --> 06:35.590
<i>[Narrator] And the next morning,</i>
<i>the family met at Buster's send-off party...</i>

06:35.695 --> 06:38.163
<i>where Lucille was not keeping</i>
<i>her feelings hidden.</i>

06:38.264 --> 06:40.994
- A camcorder.
- That's so you can videotape it...

06:41.100 --> 06:45.002
when they put you in a naked pyramid
and point to your Charlie Browns.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.129
I ought to point to
Uncle Oscar's Charlie Browns...

06:47.240 --> 06:49.140
next time you're
on top of him, Mother.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.973
He's moving out.
See how he treats me?

06:53.079 --> 06:56.606
Just because he <i>thinks</i>
I'm having an affair with the boy's uncle.

06:56.716 --> 07:00.846
Yes. And she's not having an affair
with the boy's... uncle.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.092
It's too late for apologies.
I'm going to the army.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.650
Get me out.
You've got to get me out.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.661
Well, I'm headed down
to Mexico to find Dad...

07:10.763 --> 07:12.993
but when I get back,
maybe we'll try to figure something out.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.660
<i>[Narrator] And that's when Buster decided</i>
<i>to sneak into Mexico to avoid the service.</i>

07:16.769 --> 07:20.830
No, no. I think it'll be worked out by then.
[Giggles]

07:20.940 --> 07:23.602
- What was that all about?
- I think Buster's gonna escape to Mexico.

07:23.709 --> 07:27.167
Did the secretary not give you the picture
for Dad? I need that to show people there.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.341
- <i>Yeah. She brought that over.</i>
- Well, this, uh, is a blueprint...

07:31.451 --> 07:33.942
of Dad's face.

07:34.053 --> 07:37.682
- She used the big printer.
I'll give her that. Let's go.
- Not so fast.

07:37.790 --> 07:41.055
- Gob, who is that man on the couch?
- Who? That guy?

07:41.160 --> 07:44.129
- He's my friend.
- You don't have any friends.

07:44.230 --> 07:46.130
I have lots of friends,
Lindsay.

07:46.232 --> 07:48.393
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>In fact, the man was Ice, a bounty hunter...</i>

07:48.501 --> 07:50.401
<i>that Gob hired</i>
<i>to follow Michael.</i>

07:50.503 --> 07:53.028
- Ice may be my best friend.
- George Michael.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.869
- He's moving.
- [Ice On Walkie-talkie] He's moving.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.205
- Fun party, huh?
- No. No, it isn't.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.802
- Let's go down to Mexico.
- All right. Let me grab Ann real quick.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.143
- Ann's here?
- Yeah. I invited her.

08:03.249 --> 08:07.049
You said you wanted to spend some time with her.
You said I was being an Ann hog.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.088
- Ann Hog's coming? I thought
it was just the two of us.
- Just Ann.

08:10.189 --> 08:12.384
- All right. Load her up in the car.
- All right.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.723
Lupe, that sweater's
not a take-home.

08:15.828 --> 08:19.992
- Michael, give her a ride home.
- I'm gonna have to start
putting people in the trunk.

08:20.099 --> 08:24.763
<i>[Narrator] In fact, at that moment,</i>
<i>Buster was climbing into the trunk.</i>

08:28.908 --> 08:32.400
Mother, when you see this videotape,
you'll know that I left.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.741
Not out of cowardice,
but out of-

08:35.982 --> 08:38.472
Oh, man.
It's tiring in here.

08:40.152 --> 08:42.052
Oh.

08:43.890 --> 08:47.257
<i>[Narrator] Six minutes later,</i>
<i>Michael dropped offhis mother's housekeeper.</i>

08:48.861 --> 08:50.761
Mexico.

08:50.863 --> 08:53.889
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>In fact, he was in Santa Ana...</i>

08:54.000 --> 08:56.594
<i>a town six minutes inland</i>
<i>from his own.</i>

08:56.702 --> 08:59.933
<i>But the combination oflosing his glasses</i>
<i>and breathing carbon monoxide...</i>

09:00.039 --> 09:02.371
<i>had impaired Buster's judgment.</i>

09:02.475 --> 09:06.468
Oh, this shall keep me safe
from the hot Mexican sun.

09:06.579 --> 09:09.605
<i>Excuse me. What are you doing?</i>

09:09.715 --> 09:13.310
[With Mexican Accent]
I'm trying to find a place to live.

09:13.419 --> 09:17.879
<i>Ay.</i>
[Speaking Spanish]

09:23.229 --> 09:25.789
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Michael was heading down to Mexico...</i>

09:25.898 --> 09:27.798
<i>to find his fugitive father.</i>

09:27.900 --> 09:30.835
Can you believe this?
This is my trip with my son...

09:30.937 --> 09:33.872
and he's too busy whispering secrets
to Ann to say one word to me.

09:33.973 --> 09:36.669
- What's that?
- Nothing.

09:36.776 --> 09:39.836
We're not
whispering secrets up here.

09:39.946 --> 09:42.210
<i>Hey. Check out who's on that hog</i>
<i>in the rearview mirror.</i>

09:42.315 --> 09:44.647
- George Michael!
- What?

09:44.750 --> 09:47.685
Twenty miles to LEGOLAND.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.558
- [Rings]
- The Ice.

09:52.658 --> 09:56.651
- What have you got?
- Still on his tail, about 20 miles from LEGOLAND.

09:56.762 --> 10:00.391
- Go get him, friend.
- You're not my friend. You're a client.

10:00.499 --> 10:04.333
<i>[Narrator] Gob realized that perhaps</i>
<i>he really didn't have any friends.</i>

10:04.437 --> 10:06.701
<i>And Lucille sent hers away.</i>

Buster, Oscar's leaving.
You win.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.872
Buster get in trunk
of car.

10:10.977 --> 10:13.343
So he's not going
to the army.

10:13.446 --> 10:17.382
<i>He must have had Michael</i>
<i>sneak him into Mexico. Oh, thank God.</i>

10:17.483 --> 10:19.713
- It's better this way. Mmm.
- Mmm.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.446
I'll go unpack.

10:23.689 --> 10:27.022
- Here's some money. Go see a <i>Star War.</i>
- <i>[Knocking]</i>

10:27.126 --> 10:29.253
- Who is it?
- <i>Uh, your son.</i>

10:31.163 --> 10:33.461
- What?
- I was looking for Buster.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.091
- He's not here.
- Uh, what are you doing?

10:36.202 --> 10:40.366
- <i>I mean, do you want to go out?</i>
- Why are you trying to get me out of the house?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.964
I just thought
that we could hang out.

10:46.245 --> 10:50.579
<i>[Narrator] Lucille was suspicious</i>
<i>that Gob was up to some sort of power grab.</i>

10:50.683 --> 10:53.277
Gene Parmesan?
Lucille Bluth.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.946
My son is trying to
get me out of my house.

10:56.055 --> 10:58.421
- I think he may be up to something.
- <i>[Knocking]</i>

10:58.524 --> 11:00.924
Oh. Hold on.
That's probably him.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.895
Gene?

11:05.998 --> 11:08.558
It's just some idiot
with balloons.

11:08.668 --> 11:13.196
- Oh, is it?
- [Shrieks] I knew it!

11:13.305 --> 11:15.773
I want you to keep an eye
on my son Gob.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.607
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And Buster was finding himself right at home.</i>

11:19.712 --> 11:22.272
Oh, my God.
I used to have a shirt just like that.

11:22.381 --> 11:25.214
<i>[Narrator] It</i> was <i>Buster's old shirt.</i>
<i>Lucille had given it to Lupe.</i>

11:25.317 --> 11:29.344
And the hand chair. I had one in my room.
I wonder where that went.

11:29.455 --> 11:32.481
- <i>It went right there.</i>
- I never thought I'd miss a hand so much.

11:32.591 --> 11:34.957
You people are just like me.
[Chuckles]

11:36.195 --> 11:38.254
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Meanwhile, in the real Mexico...</i>

11:38.364 --> 11:40.594
- <i>Michael had found the stair car.</i>
- There it is.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.362
<i>And Michael set about</i>
<i>finding his father.</i>

11:44.470 --> 11:48.429
Oh, yeah. Sure, <i>señor.</i> No problem.
When do you want us to start building?

11:49.642 --> 11:51.542
Thank you.
<i>Gracias.</i>

11:51.644 --> 11:53.669
- <i>Dad? Dad?</i>
- Yeah.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.679
So, what do you
think of Ann so far?

11:55.781 --> 11:59.615
Oh, Ann? I just-
You know, I barely know her.

11:59.719 --> 12:04.281
You know? Neither of us do. She's just really
some girl as far as we're concerned. Right?

12:04.390 --> 12:06.722
- L-l-I'm determined to get to know her.
- Yeah.

12:06.826 --> 12:09.158
- Okay?
- Okay. I have an idea. When we go back...

12:09.261 --> 12:12.128
why don't just the two of you go back
in the stair car together?

12:12.231 --> 12:14.358
Well, that's no fun.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.958
For you. You know,
you guys should be together.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.731
- Oh-
- Or maybe just you and me...

12:19.839 --> 12:22.069
- if you'd rather.
- Yeah.

12:22.174 --> 12:24.972
- Or me and Ann-
- Great! Yes. Okay.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.978
I'll tell Maeby that I'll be going back
with her and Aunt Lindsay. Great.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.378
- No, no. Wait. Let's keep looking for Pop-Pop.
- Okay.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.350
Maybe somebody in the church
will know something.

12:33.452 --> 12:36.615
<i>[Narrator] In fact, George Sr.</i>
Was <i>in the church, where he was mourned...</i>

12:36.722 --> 12:40.988
<i>by his longtime assistant</i>
<i>and accomplice to his escape, Kitty...</i>

12:41.093 --> 12:44.392
<i>as only a few days earlier,</i>
<i>he'd been declared dead.</i>

- <i>[Gunshot]</i>
- [Groans]

12:46.499 --> 12:49.059
- <i>But before Michael could go inside the church</i>- 
- <i>[Yelling]</i>

12:50.102 --> 12:52.900
Hey. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

12:53.005 --> 12:56.532
- I know you. You're Gob's friend.
- Not friend. Bounty hunter.

12:57.643 --> 12:59.907
Gene? There's no way
you're that good.

13:00.012 --> 13:03.504
Name's Ice. Gob hired me to stop you
from fleeing the country.

13:03.616 --> 13:08.747
What? Are you kidding me? I'm not fleeing
the country. I'm here looking for my father.

13:08.854 --> 13:11.516
But you're obviously better
at this kind of thing. I'll tell you what.

13:11.624 --> 13:15.526
I'm gonna continue paying you
to find my father.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.028
You can also collect
the real bounty on his head.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.724
Nice deck.
Is this where you saw him last?

13:20.833 --> 13:22.767
No, this-
That's actually him.

13:22.868 --> 13:25.803
- He's just- He's much smaller in real life.
- I can see that's a man.

13:25.905 --> 13:28.271
I'll find him.

13:28.374 --> 13:32.310
- Lucky.
- <i>What did he say? Did he ask about me?</i>

13:32.411 --> 13:34.777
I can't believe he followed us
all the way to Mexico.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.907
Uh, that's a bounty hunter, and, uh,
he's on the case, so we can all head home.

13:39.018 --> 13:42.545
So, he's not interested in me?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.714
Not unless
you know where Dad is.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.792
George Michael.

13:50.863 --> 13:55.197
Oh, hi, Dad. Yeah. They think you're in Mexico.
I'll see you when I get home.

13:55.301 --> 14:00.500
Ye- Oh, yes. Thank you. No, I found
my birth control pills. Thanks for asking, <i>Dad.</i>

14:02.174 --> 14:04.233
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Maeby had had enough ofher mother...</i>

14:04.343 --> 14:06.243
<i>and decided to go back</i>
<i>with Michael.</i>

14:06.345 --> 14:08.939
I'm so sick of her.
The lame flirting.

14:09.048 --> 14:11.539
<i>[Narrator] Michael, of course,</i>
<i>thought Maeby was referring to Ann.</i>

14:11.650 --> 14:14.414
I think he's gonna get sick of her
before it goes too far.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.647
Of course he will.
She's a child.

14:16.755 --> 14:18.689
Well, that- that part's
not really her fault.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.986
I just hate to see him
wasting his time, you know?

14:21.093 --> 14:24.153
- Let's go. I'll be in your car.
- Is George Michael okay with that?

14:24.263 --> 14:26.595
- It's fine. Just drive.
- <i>[Narrator] At no point...</i>

14:26.699 --> 14:28.929
<i>were Michael and Maeby</i>
<i>talking about the same person.</i>

14:29.034 --> 14:31.127
<i>And there were only</i>
<i>four people in their group.</i>

14:31.237 --> 14:33.072
And it's not a race thing.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.106
Yeah. Whoever
gets there first.

14:35.207 --> 14:38.768
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And so Michael left with his niece...</i>

<i>Meanwhile, Buster was adapting</i>
<i>to life in what he thought was Mexico...</i>

14:54.760 --> 14:58.161
<i>but was in fact a town so close to home</i>
<i>that they shared a paperboy.</i>

14:58.264 --> 15:00.994
[Boy In Car]
I know that guy.
Hey! Where's your mother?

15:01.100 --> 15:03.295
Oh, I love this way of life.
This is where I belong.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.370
I love being Mexican.

15:05.471 --> 15:09.407
- We must work now, <i>amigo. Adiós.</i>
- Oh, no. I'm going with you.

15:09.508 --> 15:12.966
[Mexican Accent]
I am one of you now <i>. Ssí?</i>

15:13.078 --> 15:15.876
<i>[Narrator] And Michael,</i>
<i>on his way back home, bonded with Maeby.</i>

15:15.981 --> 15:18.814
I mean, why does everyone
have to date anyways?

15:18.918 --> 15:21.409
Right. I mean, isn't family
enough for people?

15:21.520 --> 15:25.547
<i>And, you know, not to feel sorry for myself,</i>
<i>but it's like I'm being forgotten here.</i>

15:28.027 --> 15:31.155
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And soon they all arrived at home.</i>

15:31.263 --> 15:33.390
- Hey. You're here already.
- Yeah. We won.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.729
So, uh, you guys have
a good talk?

15:35.834 --> 15:39.600
Yeah. Great talk. That cousin of yours
is a hell of a girl. Too bad you can't date her.

15:39.705 --> 15:42.833
No. I meant-Wait, you wouldn't have
a problem with that?

15:44.643 --> 15:47.578
Nothing. No, I was
talking about Ann.

- George Bluth, you're coming with me.

- <i>That's not my father.</i>
- <i>Well, according to my photograph...</i>

- it is.
- [Laughs]

- Gob? What are you doing?
- Fleeing the country. You bastard.

No. I'm still not
fleeing. Okay?

18:04.783 --> 18:06.842
I'm just here to pick up
my son's girlfriend.

She ran off the last time
we were leaving.

18:09.021 --> 18:12.957

- Yeah? Way to plant, Ann.

George Michael, uh, listen.
Why don't you and Plant wait in the stair car.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.757
- I'm gonna finish up with Gob.
- What a scare.

18:18.864 --> 18:20.593
- That's his girlfriend?
- Yeah.

18:20.699 --> 18:22.690
- Is she funny or something?
- Don't worry about it.

18:22.801 --> 18:25.770
- Why do you keep thinking that I'm running away?
- It is kind of suspicious.

18:25.871 --> 18:28.169
You didn't even ask me
to drive down here with you.

18:28.273 --> 18:32.073
The only reason I didn't ask you to come
is because of your chicken impression.

18:32.177 --> 18:34.873
- We sure did get in a lot
of trouble for that last time.
- Yeah.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.540

18:39.985 --> 18:42.215

Gene Parmesan.
How you doing?

18:46.959 --> 18:50.053
- Gene! What the hell are you doing?
- Your mother sent me to find you.

18:50.162 --> 18:54.258
- She was worried you were up to something.
- I was just looking for a friend.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.391
- What?
- Yeah, that's right, Michael.

18:56.502 --> 18:59.232
I went to our mother
because I don't have any friends.

18:59.338 --> 19:02.068
- <i>[Gene] Oh, that's funny.</i>
- Thank you.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.108
Gene, can I have
a private moment, please?

- Okay. You're on the clock.
- Thank you.

19:06.211 --> 19:08.236
Gob, what are you
talking about?

19:08.347 --> 19:11.373
If anybody needs a friend right now, it's me.
My son's furious at me...

19:11.483 --> 19:15.283
and he spends all his free time with this girl
that, frankly, I'm not that crazy about.

19:15.387 --> 19:18.049
Not crazy about?
Or not crazy about your son growing up?

19:19.458 --> 19:22.484
Uh- Maybe- Maybe
you're right about that.

19:22.594 --> 19:24.960
And I really haven't
gotten to know her.

19:25.063 --> 19:27.497
I've been
a little selfish. So-

19:27.599 --> 19:29.726
See? You are a friend.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.963
You know, I'm- I'm always gonna
look out for you. All right?

19:33.071 --> 19:35.904
And you're always gonna
look out for me.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.999
[Yells]

19:39.344 --> 19:42.211
Sorry. I did see him
coming. It's just...

19:42.314 --> 19:44.976
I kind of wanted to see
where you were going with that.

19:48.887 --> 19:50.787
Where's Uncle Gob?

19:50.889 --> 19:53.756
Well, I gave the bounty hunter
