about your commitment to our engagement?

00:37.802 --> 00:39.168
No. Why?

00:39.203 --> 00:40.436
'Cause it says right here

00:40.471 --> 00:41.538
that you're getting back
together with your ex-wife.

00:41.572 --> 00:43.106
- What?
- Right here. Page six.

00:45.510 --> 00:47.677
"Castle caught cuddling
with ex-wife publisher."

00:47.712 --> 00:49.178
No, no, this was a business lunch.

00:49.213 --> 00:50.880
We were discussing Heat and Storm books.

00:50.914 --> 00:52.848
Oh, so, um, you weren't...

00:52.883 --> 00:55.118
"gazing lovingly into her eyes"?

00:55.152 --> 00:58.321
She had spinach in her teeth.
That's just... okay.

00:58.355 --> 01:00.156
I don't... see, this wouldn't
happen if you just

01:00.157 --> 01:01.457
let me announce our engagement.

01:01.492 --> 01:02.758
We already talked about this.

01:02.792 --> 01:04.427
Everyone that's important
to us already knows.

01:04.461 --> 01:06.262
Yes, and just because
I'm a public figure

01:06.296 --> 01:08.664
- doesn't mean you need to be one, too.
I know. - Exactly.

01:08.698 --> 01:10.132
Well...
(Paper rustles)

01:10.166 --> 01:11.800
As long as you don't mind
this sort of thing happening.

01:11.835 --> 01:13.101
I don't. 'Cause it's not true.

01:13.136 --> 01:14.537
And it only gives me more material...

01:14.571 --> 01:16.572
(Whispers)
to torture you with.

01:16.606 --> 01:17.640
Mm, and the student becomes the master.

(Doorbell buzzes)

01:20.644 --> 01:22.745
Who rings the doorbell
at 6:45 in the morning?

01:22.779 --> 01:25.047
Hey, Mr. C.! Hope I didn't wake ya.

01:25.081 --> 01:26.081
No.

01:26.115 --> 01:27.349
I was just on my way to work,

01:27.383 --> 01:28.716
thought I would pick up
my letter of recommendation.

01:28.751 --> 01:31.286
Right! For your grant, uh, application.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.221
Really appreciate you doing it.

01:33.256 --> 01:34.589
I know I told Alexis I was finished,

01:34.623 --> 01:36.891
but I... I hadn't really quite, um...

01:36.926 --> 01:39.127
I'm still tweaking it.
This... I'm getting it just right.

01:39.162 --> 01:40.895
You're a perfectionist, like me.

01:40.930 --> 01:43.865
Well, take your time...
not too much time.

01:43.899 --> 01:45.299
Deadline's tonight.

01:45.333 --> 01:46.868
I'll have it done by lunch.

01:46.902 --> 01:48.703
Thanks, Mr. C.!

01:48.737 --> 01:50.438
- You're the best!
- I know.

01:50.472 --> 01:51.906
- Hi!
- Hi, Pi!

01:51.941 --> 01:53.541
Bye!

01:53.576 --> 01:55.376
You haven't written a word, have you?

01:55.410 --> 01:58.345
No. But in my defense,
what am I supposed to write?

01:58.380 --> 01:59.746
- It's Pi.
- So then why'd you offer?

01:59.781 --> 02:03.084
I didn't. Alexis asked. I can't say no.

02:03.118 --> 02:06.587
But no more excuses.
I'm gonna do it right now.

02:06.621 --> 02:08.822
(Cell phone ringing)

02:08.856 --> 02:11.125
Unless that's a murder.

02:11.159 --> 02:13.293
This is Harvey Stryker
with celebgazer.com.

02:13.327 --> 02:14.461
We're getting unconfirmed reports that

02:14.495 --> 02:17.430
pop diva Mandy Sutton is dead at 22.

02:17.465 --> 02:20.166
Mandy Sutton? Oh, no.

02:20.201 --> 02:22.402
Alexis used to love
her kids show, "Mandy Melody."

02:22.436 --> 02:23.770
She was a regular teen by day

02:23.805 --> 02:25.839
and a crime-fighting pop star by night.

02:25.873 --> 02:26.907
But no one recognized her at school

02:26.941 --> 02:28.141
because she wore glasses.

02:28.175 --> 02:29.742
Well, it looks like
she could've used that trick

02:29.776 --> 02:31.578
in real life.

02:31.612 --> 02:33.813
I mean, look at this.
No wonder she was such a mess.

02:33.847 --> 02:35.415
Detective!

02:35.449 --> 02:37.450
Can you confirm for us that Mandy
Sutton's dead? I, you know...

02:37.485 --> 02:39.219
- Can you give us any details about how she
died? - I gotta go. I have work to do. Sorry.

02:39.253 --> 02:40.820
Oh, hey, Richard Castle. Is it true

02:40.854 --> 02:42.422
that you're getting back
together with your ex-wife?

02:42.456 --> 02:44.690
This isn't about me today.

02:46.326 --> 02:47.426
Uh, Castle?

02:47.460 --> 02:48.828
How come you didn't deny it?

02:48.862 --> 02:51.196
- What do you mean? Back there? Are you
kidding? - Mm-hmm.

02:51.231 --> 02:52.865
Yeah, if I deny that,
then they think it's true.

02:52.899 --> 02:55.067
- I thought that stuff didn't bother you.
- It doesn't.

02:55.102 --> 02:56.468
Hey.

02:56.503 --> 02:58.938
- So Mandy lived in this building?
- Yeah, penthouse.

02:58.972 --> 03:01.173
Doorman found her
just before 6:00 this morning.

03:01.207 --> 03:04.776
- O.D.?
- Given her lifestyle, you'd think.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.711
But this is plain old-fashioned murder...

03:06.746 --> 03:08.980
blunt-force trauma
to the back of the head,

03:09.015 --> 03:11.816
the facial lacerations
probably happened with the fall.

03:11.851 --> 03:13.152
Okay, when did this happen?

03:13.186 --> 03:15.654
Lividity puts it between
9:00 and 11:00 last night.

03:15.688 --> 03:17.523
Well, we can cut
that time frame in half.

03:17.557 --> 03:19.423
Doorman said that
the limo dropped her off

03:19.458 --> 03:21.159
to the lobby last night at 10:00 P.M.

03:21.193 --> 03:23.361
She was killed within an hour
of returning home?

03:23.395 --> 03:24.696
What was she doing back here?

03:24.730 --> 03:26.364
Doorman didn't know. But he said that

03:26.398 --> 03:27.666
she uses that door sometimes

03:27.700 --> 03:29.968
when she wants to avoid the crowd.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.103
So maybe she was sneaking out
or meeting someone?

03:32.138 --> 03:33.872
If so, it was probably someone she knew.

03:33.906 --> 03:35.306
Gates are locked on both sides.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.874
You need an access code to get in.

03:36.908 --> 03:38.476
Is there any security cam
footage we can pull?

03:38.510 --> 03:39.677
Not back here.

03:39.711 --> 03:41.078
Ironic, seeing as how
she spent her entire life

03:41.112 --> 03:42.146
in front of cameras.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.542
Paparazzi was out front last night.

03:43.549 --> 03:45.149
Let's see if we can get copies
of their photos.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.751
Whoever was behind this
might've been in that crowd.

03:47.786 --> 03:49.287
And no talking to the press,

03:49.321 --> 03:51.088
not until we know what's going on.

03:51.122 --> 03:53.057
Where is she? Oh, my God, Mandy!

03:53.091 --> 03:54.357
(Esposito) - Ma'am?
- Mandy!

03:54.392 --> 03:57.061
Ma'am, this is a crime scene.
You can't be back here.

03:57.095 --> 03:59.229
I... you don't understand.
I'm her personal assistant.

03:59.263 --> 04:00.463
You still can't be back here.

04:00.498 --> 04:01.832
But we will need
to take you to the station

04:01.866 --> 04:03.266
to get a statement.

04:03.301 --> 04:04.935
Do you have contact information
for her next of kin?

04:04.969 --> 04:07.370
That would be her... her manager.

04:07.405 --> 04:08.838
I mean, her mother.

04:10.408 --> 04:11.708
(Woman) How did this happen?

04:11.742 --> 04:14.744
What was she even doing in that alley?

04:14.778 --> 04:15.845
Do you know of anyone

04:15.879 --> 04:17.514
that would've wanted to harm
your daughter?

04:17.548 --> 04:19.249
(Sighs) Yeah.

04:19.283 --> 04:22.151
A lot of people disliked her,
who she became,

04:22.186 --> 04:24.621
her provocative clothes, and dancing.

04:24.655 --> 04:28.191
They just wanted her to be
little "Mandy Melody" forever.

04:28.225 --> 04:31.360
Had she received any threats recently?

04:31.394 --> 04:33.129
Sure, she'd get some disturbing letters.

04:33.163 --> 04:34.630
But any that were too aggressive,

04:34.664 --> 04:36.232
we'd turn over to the security firm.

04:36.266 --> 04:38.601
Okay, we're gonna need to
see all of those letters.

04:38.635 --> 04:40.837
Now do you know
if she was planning on meeting

04:40.871 --> 04:42.771
with anyone at her apartment last night?

04:42.805 --> 04:46.242
We hadn't spoken to her in two days.

04:46.276 --> 04:47.509
She was missing?

04:47.544 --> 04:49.378
No, we knew where she was.

04:49.412 --> 04:50.613
It wasn't hard to track her

04:50.647 --> 04:52.748
on social media and gossip sites.

04:52.782 --> 04:54.650
She was partying pretty hard.

04:54.684 --> 04:58.019
For the past few months,
Mandy'd been doing really great.

04:58.054 --> 05:00.856
She stayed clean
since her last stint in rehab.

05:00.890 --> 05:02.224
She even met a new guy

05:02.258 --> 05:04.793
while she was doing
her community service.

05:04.827 --> 05:07.295
Zach.

05:07.329 --> 05:10.098
He builds houses for the poor.

05:10.133 --> 05:12.734
And then a couple nights ago,
she went to a club

05:12.769 --> 05:16.103
for someone's birthday, and I guess...

05:16.138 --> 05:18.005
She got drunk and she started

05:18.039 --> 05:20.107
making out with an old boyfriend.

05:20.142 --> 05:24.579
And someone took a picture.
It hit all the gossip sites.

05:24.613 --> 05:27.482
When Zach saw...
It was too much for him.

05:27.516 --> 05:30.084
They got into a big fight,
and he left her.

05:30.118 --> 05:32.853
How long had they been dating?

05:32.888 --> 05:34.088
Four months.

05:34.122 --> 05:36.056
Which means he would know
how to access the alley

05:36.091 --> 05:37.825
behind your daughter's building.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.994
Do you know where we could find him?

05:41.830 --> 05:43.898
It's funny. The first time
I saw this picture,

05:43.932 --> 05:45.632
I didn't think I could feel any worse

05:45.667 --> 05:47.801
but... now that she's gone...

05:47.835 --> 05:50.136
Yeah? Exactly how bad did you feel?

05:50.171 --> 05:55.141
Look, I loved her.
I would never hurt her.

05:55.176 --> 05:56.610
Then you wouldn't mind us
asking where you were

05:56.644 --> 05:57.778
between 10:00 and 11:00 last night.

05:57.812 --> 05:59.546
I... I didn't do this, okay?

05:59.580 --> 06:01.915
I was at a lumberyard
in Fairfield, New Jersey,

06:01.949 --> 06:03.350
loading up a truck
with the rest of these guys.

06:03.384 --> 06:05.051
You can... you can ask them.

06:05.085 --> 06:06.585
And the last time you saw her?

06:06.620 --> 06:08.587
Two days ago when I broke it off.

06:08.622 --> 06:10.589
Why are you asking <i>me these questions?</i>

06:10.624 --> 06:11.791
I'm not the one

06:11.826 --> 06:13.492
with the attempted manslaughter charges.

06:13.527 --> 06:14.694
Manslaughter charge?

06:14.728 --> 06:16.248
Yeah, her ex-boyfriend, Jesse Jones...

06:16.263 --> 06:18.298
the one in that picture.

06:18.332 --> 06:20.966
He's the one who got her
into drugs in the first place.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.836
And Mandy never told anyone this,

06:23.870 --> 06:25.204
but the last time they broke up,

06:25.238 --> 06:27.340
he threatened to kill her.

06:27.374 --> 06:28.741
Weapons charges.

06:28.775 --> 06:31.644
Aggravated assault.
(Folder thuds)

06:31.678 --> 06:34.480
That's a hell of a resume, Jesse.

06:34.514 --> 06:36.014
How does someone like you

06:36.049 --> 06:39.517
hook up with a superstar like Mandy?

06:39.552 --> 06:40.819
Like all the other
pretty little rich girls

06:40.854 --> 06:42.054
that come to me for their ink.

06:42.055 --> 06:44.289
She was looking for a lot more
than a tattoo.

06:44.324 --> 06:46.158
I was happy to provide.

06:46.192 --> 06:48.327
So I read online that the two of you

06:48.361 --> 06:49.962
were stormy and it didn't end well.

06:49.996 --> 06:51.096
You trashed her apartment

06:51.130 --> 06:53.165
and made some pretty serious threats.

06:53.199 --> 06:55.667
Water under the bridge.

06:55.701 --> 06:57.168
Until two nights ago,
when you guys hooked up.

06:57.202 --> 06:58.503
How'd that happen?

06:58.537 --> 07:01.740
I was at a bar. She came in,

07:01.774 --> 07:03.174
threw herself at me like old times,

07:03.208 --> 07:05.076
and I obliged.

07:05.110 --> 07:06.210
That was the last time I saw her.

07:06.245 --> 07:07.545
How'd you take it

07:07.580 --> 07:10.714
when right after that
photo of you two appeared,

07:10.749 --> 07:13.417
she told "Celebgazer" that you were...

07:13.451 --> 07:15.753
human trash... and that that night was

07:15.787 --> 07:18.923
<i>"the</i> biggest mistake of her life"?

07:18.957 --> 07:23.294
She seemed to like it okay at the time.

07:23.328 --> 07:26.063
Where were you last night
between 10:00 and 11:00?

07:26.098 --> 07:28.866
I was at a pool hall in Queens
with some friends.

07:28.900 --> 07:33.103
(Cell phone rings)

07:33.137 --> 07:34.638
(Notepad and pen thud)

07:34.672 --> 07:35.739
Names.
(Ring)

07:35.774 --> 07:37.974
(Pen clicks)

07:38.009 --> 07:40.911
(Beep)
Lanie, what's going on?

07:40.945 --> 07:43.579
We have a little problem here.

07:43.614 --> 07:45.515
So what's the problem?

07:45.549 --> 07:47.384
(Mrs. Sutton) I'll tell you
what the problem is.

07:47.418 --> 07:49.485
That's not my daughter.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.954
That's not Mandy.

08:05.950 --> 08:08.852
So Mandy's mom identified
our victim as... (Clack)

08:08.886 --> 08:12.454
Claire Samuels, 25.
She was an aspiring actress.

08:12.489 --> 08:14.523
(Castle) - And Mandy's decoy.
- Decoy?

08:14.557 --> 08:16.125
Yeah, to fool the press.

08:16.159 --> 08:19.328
It's a practice not uncommon
in this age of <i>stalkerazzi.</i>

08:19.362 --> 08:22.131
So she'd dress up as Mandy.
She'd put on sunglasses.

08:22.165 --> 08:23.766
She'd let the hordes follow her

08:23.800 --> 08:26.068
so that Mandy could go about unnoticed.

08:26.103 --> 08:28.470
Now we notified Claire's
parents. They're flying in,

08:28.505 --> 08:30.672
and Esposito's digging
into her life as we speak.

08:30.706 --> 08:33.275
So if Claire is our actual victim,

08:33.308 --> 08:35.144
then where's Mandy Sutton?

08:35.178 --> 08:37.446
We don't know. No one has seen her,

08:37.480 --> 08:38.580
and she's not answering her phone.

08:38.615 --> 08:40.482
Given that Claire
was pretending to be Mandy

08:40.517 --> 08:42.717
when she was killed,
then we need to consider

08:42.751 --> 08:45.386
the very real possibility
that Mandy Sutton

08:45.420 --> 08:47.522
was our killer's intended target,

08:47.556 --> 08:49.590
and that they might
be looking to finish the job.

08:49.625 --> 08:52.426
They may already have,
which is why we can't find her.

08:52.461 --> 08:55.296
Found her. She's checked
into the Wessex hotel

08:55.330 --> 08:56.430
under one of her aliases.

08:56.465 --> 08:59.267
But she's not answering her room phone.

08:59.301 --> 09:01.202
And she's not responding
to knocks on the door.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.236
(Clicks and beeps)

09:07.442 --> 09:08.709
(Whispers) Castle.

09:20.254 --> 09:23.090
That's not blood. It's wine.

09:23.124 --> 09:24.925
(Grunts)

09:24.959 --> 09:26.526
(Moans)

09:26.561 --> 09:29.262
(Weakly) Closing time already?

09:29.297 --> 09:30.363
(Moans)

09:32.834 --> 09:35.134
Who are you?

09:35.169 --> 09:37.237
What do you mean, I'm dead?

09:37.271 --> 09:39.673
Claire Samuels was killed last night,

09:39.707 --> 09:41.641
and the world thinks that that was you.

09:41.676 --> 09:43.210
Who?

09:43.244 --> 09:46.279
Claire Samuels... she's your decoy.

09:46.314 --> 09:47.847
The girl we dressed to look like you

09:47.881 --> 09:50.217
to confuse the paparazzi.

09:50.251 --> 09:53.152
<i>Oh.</i> Oh, yeah, um...

09:53.187 --> 09:55.088
God, that's pretty harsh.

09:55.122 --> 09:58.057
Do you know why she went
to your apartment last night?

09:58.092 --> 10:00.259
No. Why?

10:00.293 --> 10:01.460
Well, I mean, we're trying to figure out

10:01.494 --> 10:02.894
how she got there, and your mom said

10:02.896 --> 10:05.297
that she wasn't scheduled
to work yesterday. So...

10:05.332 --> 10:08.434
Yeah, uh, the limo company
claims that the car

10:08.468 --> 10:10.502
she arrived in was ordered by you.

10:10.537 --> 10:15.073
I've never drunk dialed
a limo before. But...

10:15.108 --> 10:18.577
Nope. Wasn't me.

10:18.612 --> 10:20.312
What about Claire? Did you call her?

10:20.347 --> 10:21.813
No. I barely know her.

10:21.848 --> 10:24.182
We discouraged personal contact.

10:24.217 --> 10:26.517
It wouldn't make much sense
to have a decoy

10:26.552 --> 10:28.787
if they're gonna be seen
hanging out together.

10:28.821 --> 10:30.622
(Raspy voice) Can I lie down now?

10:30.656 --> 10:32.090
Actually, miss Sutton, we still
have a few more questions

10:32.125 --> 10:33.458
for you about your life.

10:33.492 --> 10:35.160
<i>My</i> life?

10:35.194 --> 10:37.662
Yeah, we think you may have been
the intended target.

10:37.696 --> 10:39.831
Oh, yeah.

10:39.866 --> 10:42.700
That does make more sense. Okay.

10:42.735 --> 10:44.101
So, um, do you know

10:44.136 --> 10:46.638
if anyone would have wanted to hurt you?

10:46.672 --> 10:48.839
Do you have any enemies?

10:48.874 --> 10:52.176
The press, but... they wouldn't hurt me.

10:52.210 --> 10:55.480
Without me, who would they write
all those bad things about?

10:55.514 --> 10:59.049
Okay, well, the last two days
when you were out...

10:59.084 --> 11:01.585
Socializing, did you have any fights

11:01.619 --> 11:03.888
or did you upset anyone?

11:03.922 --> 11:07.357
Probably.

11:07.392 --> 11:10.227
I'm...
(Sighs)

11:10.262 --> 11:13.330
a little hazy on the details.

11:13.364 --> 11:15.532
(Inhales deeply)
Okay.

11:15.566 --> 11:17.033
- Okay.
- That it?

11:17.067 --> 11:18.968
Uh, yeah, for now. In the meantime,

11:19.003 --> 11:20.923
you should probably go back
to the hotel and, uh,

11:20.938 --> 11:22.639
lay low in your room.

11:22.674 --> 11:24.073
Shouldn't we make an announcement?

11:24.108 --> 11:26.389
Let everyone know that she isn't dead?
Well, you know what?

11:26.411 --> 11:27.444
If someone was trying to kill her,

11:27.478 --> 11:28.918
it might be safer to let them assume

11:28.946 --> 11:30.847
that they've actually succeeded
while we're still doing our job.

11:30.881 --> 11:33.582
How long? She starts a tour next week.

11:33.617 --> 11:35.985
And as her manager, I can't imagine that

11:36.020 --> 11:38.387
it's gonna help ticket sales
if everyone thinks she's dead.

11:38.422 --> 11:42.058
Yeah, wouldn't want to screw up
the big comeback tour.

11:42.092 --> 11:44.828
Sweetie, you've worked
really hard on those new songs.

11:44.862 --> 11:46.429
We're talking about staying out of sight

11:46.463 --> 11:48.564
for a day, maybe less.

11:48.598 --> 11:50.966
Hopefully by then we'll have
a lead that'll help us

11:51.000 --> 11:52.435
figure out who's behind this.

11:52.469 --> 11:54.236
(Ryan) Uh, Beckett?

11:54.270 --> 11:55.838
I might have an idea about that.

11:55.872 --> 11:58.674
We found this anonymous letter
in her fan mail.

11:58.709 --> 12:02.211
"I'm watching you, and I don't
like what I see."

12:02.245 --> 12:05.113
Yeah, well, get in line.

12:05.148 --> 12:07.182
Guys... look around.

12:07.217 --> 12:09.184
I get letters from creepazoids
all the time.

12:09.219 --> 12:11.119
But in addition to the letter,

12:11.154 --> 12:14.890
- he also included these.
- Oh, my God.

12:14.924 --> 12:17.459
That's my bedroom, while I was sleeping.

12:17.493 --> 12:20.027
Your building is supposed to be secure.

12:20.062 --> 12:22.029
- How did he get in?
- That's ink-jet paper.

12:22.064 --> 12:23.331
- Mm-hmm.
- So?

12:23.366 --> 12:24.899
So we might be able to track it.

12:24.933 --> 12:27.702
- How?
- Most people don't know this,

12:27.737 --> 12:29.237
but the serial number
of the printer that was used

12:29.271 --> 12:30.472
to make these photographs

12:30.506 --> 12:32.440
is actually embedded into the picture.

12:32.475 --> 12:33.875
It's printed in tiny, little yellow dots

12:33.909 --> 12:35.910
invisible to the naked eye.
It's... it's an FBI thing

12:35.944 --> 12:37.444
used to track counterfeiters.

12:37.479 --> 12:40.547
(Exhales deeply) I don't feel so hot.

12:40.582 --> 12:44.651
You know, I... I think
someone needs a cup of coffee.

12:44.686 --> 12:45.719
(Gurgling)

12:46.721 --> 12:47.922
(Hisses)
All right.

12:47.956 --> 12:51.425
Here is your 4-shot latte.

12:51.459 --> 12:53.093
How you feeling?

12:53.127 --> 12:55.829
Considering I'm supposed to be dead,

12:55.864 --> 12:56.897
about right.

12:56.931 --> 12:58.365
Yeah...
(Chuckles)

12:58.400 --> 13:01.502
I just can't believe that freak
was actually in my bedroom.

13:01.536 --> 13:02.903
We'll find him.

13:02.937 --> 13:04.838
I know how tough it can be...

13:04.873 --> 13:07.140
the crazy fans, the constant scrutiny,

13:07.174 --> 13:08.942
the pressure of living your life

13:08.976 --> 13:11.844
under a microscope.
I mean, I can relate.

13:11.879 --> 13:14.447
On a smaller scale,
of course, but still, it's...

13:14.481 --> 13:18.285
Wh... who are you?

13:18.319 --> 13:22.588
On a much smaller scale.

13:22.623 --> 13:24.958
- Dad. There you are.
- Hey, Alexis.

13:24.992 --> 13:26.726
What are you doing he...
oh, the, uh, the letter for Pi...

13:26.760 --> 13:29.796
the... I just, I'm about to...
I just gotta make a few tweaks.

13:29.830 --> 13:33.132
- You haven't written it.
- Not all... not yet.

13:33.166 --> 13:34.606
I thought you might need some help...

13:34.635 --> 13:35.868
(Beep) So I came up with
some talking points for you.

13:35.903 --> 13:37.670
Oh, good. Okay, um...

13:37.704 --> 13:40.339
"Outstanding person... natural leader."

13:40.373 --> 13:42.774
Dad, I know you and Pi
don't always see eye-to-eye.

13:42.809 --> 13:44.509
If you don't feel comfortable
doing this...

13:44.544 --> 13:46.045
No, listen, hey...
(Cell phone thuds)

13:46.079 --> 13:47.546
Hey, Pi and I see eye-to-eye

13:47.580 --> 13:50.849
on one very important redheaded thing.

13:50.883 --> 13:52.617
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

13:52.652 --> 13:55.054
Hey! Can you believe that
about Mandy Sutton?

13:55.088 --> 13:57.522
- It's weird, right?
- Yes, weird...

13:57.557 --> 13:59.157
Remember how much I loved her show,

13:59.191 --> 14:01.125
and those secret identity glasses?

14:01.160 --> 14:02.661
If you were mad at me,
I'd wear a pair of glasses

14:02.695 --> 14:04.996
to dinner, and you'd pretend
like you didn't know who I was?

14:05.030 --> 14:06.832
I remember, actually...
(Chuckles) But then she grew up.

14:06.866 --> 14:08.867
And whoa! I mean, how does that
happen to someone...

14:08.901 --> 14:11.369
becoming such a hot mess? I...

14:11.403 --> 14:13.037
(Thuds)

14:15.907 --> 14:17.675
Oh, my God.

14:19.744 --> 14:22.380
- I... thought you were...
- Yeah.

14:22.414 --> 14:25.049
Alexis, this is Mandy.

14:25.084 --> 14:27.585
We're just, uh, keeping her
under wraps for now.

14:27.619 --> 14:28.719
This is my daughter.

14:28.753 --> 14:29.887
Hmm.

14:29.921 --> 14:32.422
It's nice to meet you.

14:32.457 --> 14:34.792
No, dad, it's not true.

14:34.826 --> 14:36.727
Yes, I know what they wrote.

14:36.761 --> 14:38.028
We're still engaged.

14:38.062 --> 14:39.997
What do you mean aunt Theresa
put it on her Facebook?

14:40.031 --> 14:42.399
Well, t... tell her to take it down.

14:42.433 --> 14:45.102
I gotta go. I love you.

14:45.136 --> 14:46.236
Bye.

14:46.270 --> 14:47.738
(Cell phone thuds)
Hey, Espo.

14:47.772 --> 14:49.072
Do you believe everything

14:49.107 --> 14:50.540
that they write in the newspapers?
Oh. (Scoffs)

14:50.574 --> 14:52.909
Hell, no. I mean, except for that thing

14:52.943 --> 14:56.313
between Castle and his ex-wife.
I mean, it's...

14:57.815 --> 15:00.117
Did you find anything on Claire?

15:00.151 --> 15:01.584
As a matter of fact, I did.

15:01.619 --> 15:03.887
I went into the phone records
of that limo company.

15:03.921 --> 15:05.722
It turns out that Claire was the one

15:05.756 --> 15:06.789
who ordered that limo last night.

15:06.824 --> 15:09.225
Why would Claire order a limo

15:09.259 --> 15:10.860
to take her to Mandy's place?
I don't know.

15:10.895 --> 15:12.695
But I just got off the phone
with Claire's roommate.

15:12.730 --> 15:14.130
Said Claire's been
going through some things

15:14.164 --> 15:16.432
the last couple of days.
She's been upset... crying.

15:16.466 --> 15:17.600
(Ryan) Hey.

15:17.635 --> 15:19.002
Those photos of Mandy in her bedroom...

15:19.036 --> 15:21.004
I traced the printer's serial number

15:21.038 --> 15:22.538
to an electronics store in midtown.

15:22.572 --> 15:24.473
According to the extended warranty,

15:24.508 --> 15:26.442
it belongs to a Ken Castor.

15:26.476 --> 15:29.645
So he's done time. For aggravated assault.
And then two years ago,

15:29.679 --> 15:30.913
he was hit with a restraining order

15:30.947 --> 15:32.981
for stalking... Mandy Sutton.

15:33.016 --> 15:34.616
Old habits die hard.

15:34.651 --> 15:37.186
And those paparazzi photos from
the night that she was killed,

15:37.220 --> 15:40.321
I went through them.
Look who was right there

15:40.356 --> 15:42.024
when Claire stepped out of that limo...

15:42.058 --> 15:44.593
Same guy.

15:44.627 --> 15:46.028
(Clatters)

15:46.062 --> 15:47.429
Police! N.Y.P.D.!

15:53.469 --> 15:54.469
(Clattering) Kitchen clear.

15:54.503 --> 15:56.071
Bedroom clear!

15:56.105 --> 15:57.138
(Ryan) Hey. Closet.

15:58.340 --> 16:00.408
Aah!

16:00.443 --> 16:01.642
Aah! (Grunting)

16:01.677 --> 16:03.511
Let go of me!

16:03.546 --> 16:05.012
(Continues grunting)

16:05.047 --> 16:07.014
Let go of me! Gimme your arm!

16:07.049 --> 16:08.283
I didn't do anything!

16:08.317 --> 16:11.318
You okay? Yeah.

16:13.388 --> 16:15.222
I think we got our guy.

16:24.162 --> 16:26.669
No, listen. You don't understand.

16:26.709 --> 16:27.843
The hell we don't.

16:27.877 --> 16:29.245
We know that you took
those pictures, Ken.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.679
We know that you were in her apartment.

16:30.713 --> 16:33.516
Because she needed me.

16:33.550 --> 16:35.183
<i>Needed</i> you?

16:35.217 --> 16:36.217
I was protecting her.

16:36.252 --> 16:38.353
I was watching over her, and she...

16:38.387 --> 16:39.454
She needed that.

16:39.488 --> 16:40.889
Right.

16:40.924 --> 16:42.290
'Cause she didn't
have people watching her

16:42.324 --> 16:44.726
and staring at her already.
They didn't care.

16:44.761 --> 16:46.929
Not like me. They... they...

16:46.963 --> 16:48.730
They don't understand her.

16:48.765 --> 16:52.467
I mean, they drove her to it, you know?

16:52.501 --> 16:54.869
That's why I sent her the pictures...

16:54.903 --> 16:57.138
because she needed to know
that someone cared.

16:57.173 --> 16:59.740
She... she needed to know
that someone was watching.

16:59.775 --> 17:00.908
Is that what you were doing

17:00.943 --> 17:03.244
outside of her apartment last night?

17:03.279 --> 17:06.146
Watching?

17:08.550 --> 17:10.585
(Voice trembling)
I-I should have saved her.

17:10.618 --> 17:12.053
But I-I never saw her.

17:12.087 --> 17:14.088
I-I-I waited for the limo,

17:14.122 --> 17:15.890
but then that girl came out...

17:15.924 --> 17:18.192
the... the not Mandy, the other girl.

17:18.226 --> 17:21.127
So I-I went around to the back alley,

17:21.162 --> 17:22.696
and I waited across the street.

17:22.731 --> 17:24.251
When the other girl goes in the front,

17:24.265 --> 17:26.200
that means that Mandy goes in the back.

17:26.233 --> 17:29.169
But... but she didn't.

17:29.204 --> 17:31.538
Wait, you waited for Mandy out in back?

17:31.573 --> 17:32.672
Yeah.

17:32.707 --> 17:34.575
Did you see anything else?

17:34.609 --> 17:36.610
Did you see anyone
go in or out of that alley?

17:36.644 --> 17:38.845
J-just the motorcycle.

17:38.879 --> 17:40.614
Wait a minute. What...

17:40.648 --> 17:41.781
What motorcycle?

17:41.816 --> 17:44.283
Well, right when
I was going in the back,

17:44.318 --> 17:46.953
there was a motorcycle
that was going into the...

17:46.988 --> 17:48.421
the alley. What time? When?

17:48.455 --> 17:50.757
10:07.

17:50.791 --> 17:52.092
I-I-I wrote it down.

17:52.126 --> 17:53.960
I-I write everything down.

17:53.995 --> 17:56.695
And then at, uh, 10:12, it, uh, it left.

17:56.730 --> 17:58.131
Did you get a license plate?

17:58.165 --> 18:00.433
I couldn't write it down.
It was going too fast.

18:00.467 --> 18:02.635
What about the rider?

18:02.669 --> 18:06.905
Did you see his face?
They were wearing a helmet.

18:06.940 --> 18:09.208
I-I didn't know Mandy was back there.

18:09.243 --> 18:11.810
I mean, I-I never saw her
go back, you know?

18:11.845 --> 18:13.211
What about the motorcycle?

18:13.246 --> 18:14.379
Color? Trim?

18:14.413 --> 18:16.314
I wrote that down.

18:16.349 --> 18:18.884
It was... it was red. It was, um...

18:18.918 --> 18:20.619
Uh... (Stammering)

18:20.654 --> 18:22.721
It was a red Ducati 800 Supersport.

18:22.756 --> 18:24.957
It had gold wheels,

18:24.991 --> 18:27.960
and it had a flame decal on the body.

18:31.464 --> 18:33.598
What do you think? He's a nut job.

18:33.633 --> 18:35.733
But he's probably not our killer.

18:35.768 --> 18:38.069
Yeah? How's that? Unlike the paparazzi,

18:38.103 --> 18:39.571
he knew Claire was getting
out of the limo.

18:39.605 --> 18:40.838
So he can tell them apart.

18:40.873 --> 18:42.374
And since he's obsessed with Mandy,

18:42.408 --> 18:43.642
there would be no reason
for him to go after Claire.

18:43.676 --> 18:45.277
We'll hold him.

18:45.311 --> 18:47.645
But if he's not our killer,
he's probably our best witness.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.814
Why don't we get ahold of
traffic cam footage in the area?

18:49.848 --> 18:52.083
Let's see if we can get
a plate on that Ducati.

18:52.117 --> 18:53.685
Gold wheels, a flame decal on the body.

18:53.719 --> 18:54.919
It's gotta be a custom job.

18:54.953 --> 18:57.021
Yeah. I'll check with
bike shops in the area,

18:57.056 --> 18:59.123
see if I can find the place
that did that work.

18:59.158 --> 19:00.291
Where's Castle?

19:00.325 --> 19:01.726
He's having dinner
with his other ex-wife,

19:01.760 --> 19:03.680
something about not wanting her
to feel left out.

19:05.297 --> 19:07.364
(Chuckles) Good one. He's
holed up in the break room

19:07.399 --> 19:08.899
writing that letter
for Alexis' boyfriend.

19:08.933 --> 19:10.434
Thank you.

19:13.971 --> 19:15.539
(Alexis) Will you stop worrying?

19:15.574 --> 19:17.641
He'll have lots of great things
to say about you.

19:17.676 --> 19:18.875
I guarantee it. I don't know.

19:18.910 --> 19:21.044
I'm not exactly
Mr. C.'s favorite person.

19:21.079 --> 19:22.846
And he is taking an awfully long time.

19:22.880 --> 19:25.248
He does have other things
to do, you know.

19:25.282 --> 19:27.084
No, Al, that's not what I meant.

19:27.118 --> 19:28.785
Maybe he's done by now.

19:28.820 --> 19:30.821
He said he'd text me when it was ready.

19:30.855 --> 19:32.589
Let's see.

19:32.623 --> 19:36.326
That's weird. My phone's off.
(Cell phone clicks)

19:36.360 --> 19:37.594
<i>(Cell phone ringtone playing)</i>

19:37.628 --> 19:41.464
That's... not my ring.

19:41.498 --> 19:44.200
Hello? You have my phone.

19:44.235 --> 19:46.001
Mandy? Hi.

19:46.036 --> 19:48.170
Uh, yeah, I just realized.

19:48.205 --> 19:50.172
Funny, we must have switched. (Chuckles)

19:50.207 --> 19:52.141
I need it. I'm at the Wessex hotel.

19:52.175 --> 19:54.509
Okay. Sure. Oh, it's...

19:54.544 --> 19:57.113
not like I took it
on purpose or anything,

19:57.147 --> 19:58.647
just a misunderstanding.

19:58.681 --> 20:01.450
Room 522.

20:01.484 --> 20:03.452
(Cell phone alert chimes)
Yeah, sure. Not a...

20:03.486 --> 20:04.620
(Beep)
Hello?

20:04.654 --> 20:08.890
I guess I'm bringing Mandy her phone.

20:08.924 --> 20:10.191
I-I gotta head uptown.

20:10.226 --> 20:12.160
The bee pupae are emerging.
See you later?

20:12.194 --> 20:14.062
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye. Oh!

20:14.096 --> 20:16.598
Mwah!

20:16.633 --> 20:17.699
(Sighs)

20:19.502 --> 20:20.702
Hey.

20:20.737 --> 20:22.098
Hey, so, uh...
(Ice cubes rattling)

20:22.104 --> 20:23.204
Here's your phone.

20:26.208 --> 20:28.376
Okay.

20:30.112 --> 20:32.580
Look, I'm sorry about
that whole "hot mess" thing

20:32.614 --> 20:34.315
I said before.

20:34.349 --> 20:37.318
Sorry that you said it, or sorry that
I heard it? (Cell phone clatters)

20:37.352 --> 20:41.355
I... should probably go.

20:43.057 --> 20:45.225
It happens when you're not looking.

20:45.260 --> 20:47.662
Excuse me?

20:47.696 --> 20:49.363
Before... you asked how it happens...

20:49.398 --> 20:51.865
how someone becomes like me.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.434
It happens when you're not looking,

20:53.468 --> 20:55.436
and by the time you realize it,

20:55.470 --> 20:56.570
it's already who you are.

20:56.605 --> 20:59.439
Like the car crash
on the side of the road

20:59.473 --> 21:02.575
everybody stops and... and watches.

21:02.610 --> 21:05.578
That doesn't mean
it's who you have to be.

21:05.613 --> 21:06.847
You can always change.

21:06.881 --> 21:09.783
Turns out I don't do change so well.

21:09.818 --> 21:11.251
But...

21:11.286 --> 21:13.353
you steal a police car,

21:13.387 --> 21:15.755
and you set it on fire, I'm your girl.

21:15.790 --> 21:19.859
Or if you find the <i>greatest</i>
<i>guy in the world,</i>

21:19.893 --> 21:21.761
fall madly in love,

21:21.796 --> 21:26.199
and then mess it up by
hooking up with my dirtbag ex?

21:26.233 --> 21:27.467
<i>That</i> I can do.

21:27.501 --> 21:31.370
Yeah, I... Saw that picture online.

21:31.404 --> 21:34.740
You and the rest of the world.

21:34.774 --> 21:37.243
(Ice cubes rattle)
Maybe if you didn't drink.

21:37.277 --> 21:41.113
If I don't drink, then I start to feel.

21:41.148 --> 21:44.250
And I don't like what I feel.

21:46.220 --> 21:49.921
I wish I had those glasses
from "Mandy Melody."

21:49.956 --> 21:53.124
I'd just put 'em on and...

21:53.159 --> 21:54.960
Just disappear.

21:56.529 --> 21:59.097
(Inhales deeply) I know how you feel.

22:01.133 --> 22:04.635
How could <i>you</i> possibly know how <i>I</i> feel?

22:04.670 --> 22:07.873
Because right now, I...

22:07.907 --> 22:10.375
Wish I could disappear
from my life, too.

22:16.448 --> 22:18.917
Okay, thanks. I'll check back.

22:18.951 --> 22:20.085
(Beep) Hey.

22:20.119 --> 22:21.853
So how's Pi's recommendation going?

22:21.887 --> 22:24.554
It took me less time to write
the last Derrick Storm novel.

22:24.589 --> 22:26.055
And although they both
are works of fiction,

22:26.090 --> 22:27.824
at least that one was believable.

22:27.859 --> 22:29.025
How's the case coming?

22:29.059 --> 22:30.360
Well, we got a description
of the motorcycle

22:30.395 --> 22:32.028
that left the crime scene,
and tech's trying to get

22:32.062 --> 22:35.465
a plate off of traffic cam
footage, but so far no luck.

22:35.500 --> 22:38.034
Our luck just changed.
We got the son of a bitch.

22:38.068 --> 22:39.636
We found a shop that outfitted

22:39.670 --> 22:42.105
a red Ducati 800 with gold wheels

22:42.139 --> 22:44.807
and a flame decal
for one Josh Greenberg.

22:44.841 --> 22:46.175
Is that our guy?

22:46.210 --> 22:48.677
(Ryan) Josh Greenberg had
a slight liquidity problem.

22:48.712 --> 22:51.314
So he sold that bike
three days ago for cash

22:51.348 --> 22:53.082
to...

22:53.117 --> 22:54.217
(Magnet clacks) This guy.

22:54.251 --> 22:55.718
Jesse Jones... Mandy's ex.

22:55.752 --> 22:57.787
So he lied to us. He was in that alley.

22:57.821 --> 22:58.921
All right. Bring him in.

22:58.955 --> 23:00.790
We already sent a car over to his place.

23:00.824 --> 23:03.158
He's not there. Mandy might
be able to help out.

23:03.192 --> 23:04.259
She probably knows his hangouts.

23:04.294 --> 23:05.327
All right, go.

23:05.361 --> 23:06.429
(Pops and clatters)

23:06.463 --> 23:09.064
(Alexis) The thing about
my boyfriend is...

23:09.098 --> 23:11.199
I thought I was being so grown-up...

23:11.234 --> 23:12.367
moving in with him,
getting my own place.

23:12.402 --> 23:14.602
But now it's my whole life.

23:14.637 --> 23:16.738
And I'm pretty sure
I've made a huge mistake.

23:16.772 --> 23:19.841
Do you know why I'm helping him
with his grant application?

23:19.875 --> 23:22.311
Because if he gets it,
he'll have to travel.

23:22.345 --> 23:25.080
That is messed up. You need to tell him.

23:25.114 --> 23:26.348
Tell him what?

23:26.382 --> 23:29.017
That I changed my mind?
I don't want a relationship?

23:29.052 --> 23:30.051
We have a lease.

23:30.085 --> 23:32.454
That's romantic.

23:32.488 --> 23:33.922
And he doesn't deserve it.

23:33.956 --> 23:35.590
He hasn't done anything wrong.

23:35.624 --> 23:37.091
Oh! And then there's my dad.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.526
What do I tell him, huh?

23:38.561 --> 23:40.161
That he was <i>right all along,</i>

23:40.195 --> 23:42.597
that I wasn't ready? (Forced laugh)

23:42.631 --> 23:44.766
I wish I would have said that. (Sighs)

23:44.800 --> 23:47.234
I wasn't ready for <i>so</i> many things.

23:47.269 --> 23:49.070
Do you ever look back
on something you've done

23:49.104 --> 23:51.538
and... it's like
someone else is doing it?

23:51.573 --> 23:53.507
You're kidding, right?

23:53.541 --> 23:55.042
Right.

23:55.077 --> 23:58.612
(Chuckles) Sorry, I...

23:58.646 --> 24:00.514
Haven't had anyone to talk to.

24:00.548 --> 24:02.283
Clearly.

24:02.317 --> 24:03.917
(Sighs)

24:03.952 --> 24:05.619
"Be true to yourself."

24:05.653 --> 24:08.054
That's what Zach would say.

24:08.089 --> 24:10.924
And if a situation is bad for you,

24:10.959 --> 24:13.426
leave it. That's what
we were going to do.

24:13.461 --> 24:14.822
And that's what you should do, too.

24:14.829 --> 24:18.298
(Chuckles)
(Cell phone alert chimes)

24:18.332 --> 24:21.734
Mandy, is someone texting you?

24:21.768 --> 24:23.603
Weird, since I'm supposed to be dead.

24:23.637 --> 24:24.904
(Lid clatters)

24:24.938 --> 24:26.606
Oh, it's my friend Sam.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.074
"Pretty sure you're not dead.

24:28.109 --> 24:29.609
"Need to talk about girl who died,

24:29.643 --> 24:32.145
something you need to know"?

24:32.179 --> 24:33.146
(Dialing)

24:33.180 --> 24:34.647
Wait, what... what are you doing?

24:34.681 --> 24:36.883
Calling him? But you're
supposed to be laying low.

24:36.917 --> 24:38.217
No one's supposed to know you're alive.

24:38.251 --> 24:39.886
He already knows I'm alive.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.387
He <i>thinks</i> you're alive.

24:41.421 --> 24:43.122
He might be trying to find out for sure.

24:43.156 --> 24:44.390
And what if it's not Sam?

24:44.424 --> 24:45.892
It could be the killer
trying to lure you out.

24:45.926 --> 24:49.361
Would you relax?
It's Sam's number, okay?

24:49.396 --> 24:50.663
And he's not answering, which means

24:50.697 --> 24:52.097
he's probably bartending.

24:52.132 --> 24:55.200
That place he works is really loud.
(Beep)

24:55.235 --> 24:56.801
I have to go see him.

24:56.836 --> 24:58.770
You can't go out.
What if someone sees you?

24:58.804 --> 25:00.172
You don't get it, do you?

25:00.206 --> 25:02.774
I am the one
that is supposed to be dead,

25:02.808 --> 25:05.844
not Claire. She died because of me.

25:05.878 --> 25:08.013
And I know that people
think that I don't care,

25:08.048 --> 25:09.147
but I'm not a monster.

25:09.181 --> 25:11.616
If Sam has information
about Claire's death,

25:11.651 --> 25:13.184
I need to know what it is.

25:13.218 --> 25:16.154
I just want to do one thing right.

25:18.558 --> 25:19.991
Mandy! (Huffs)

25:20.026 --> 25:22.126
You shouldn't be doing this.

25:22.161 --> 25:23.795
Yeah, well, you're not gonna stop me.

25:23.829 --> 25:25.363
Okay, but if you're going to do it,

25:25.397 --> 25:26.531
you can't be recognized.

25:26.565 --> 25:28.032
Do you understand?
You're going to need someone

25:28.067 --> 25:29.227
to do all the talking for you.

25:29.234 --> 25:32.336
(Elevator bell dings) (Sighs) Come on.

25:36.308 --> 25:39.710
(Sighs)

25:46.267 --> 25:48.877
Mandy's gone?! Gone where?

25:48.915 --> 25:49.948
We're not sure.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.215
No one at the front desk saw her leave.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.484
(Sighs) Are there any signs
of foul play?

25:53.518 --> 25:55.153
(Beep) Nah, it looks
like she just took off.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.155
Maybe she, uh, picked up
where she left off

25:57.189 --> 25:58.722
on that bender.
You guys gotta come back.

25:58.757 --> 26:00.124
We have to coordinate a search.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.692
We'll check with the limo company,

26:01.726 --> 26:03.027
see if she called for a pickup.
And I'll talk to her mom.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.263
I'll get a list of all
the places she likes to go to.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.465
We have to find her
before Jesse figures out

26:07.499 --> 26:09.867
that he killed the wrong person.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.168
What?

26:11.202 --> 26:12.369
What happened?

There he is. There's Sam.

the one of the limo dropping "you" off

27:28.411 --> 27:29.810
How could you tell?

27:29.845 --> 27:31.046

27:31.080 --> 27:32.847
was in here last night
wearing the same thing

27:32.881 --> 27:34.349
she had on as when
she got out of that limo.

27:34.383 --> 27:36.551
Wait a second.
Claire was here last night?

27:36.585 --> 27:38.853
Yeah, yeah. I think
that's what her name was.

27:38.887 --> 27:39.921
You talked to her?

27:39.955 --> 27:41.235
Yeah, she came in looking for me.

27:41.257 --> 27:42.457
She heard I was friends with Mandy.

27:42.491 --> 27:43.858
She wanted her private number.

27:43.892 --> 27:47.327
What for? She was trying
to reach you because

27:47.362 --> 27:48.829
she thought somebody
was trying to hurt you.

27:48.864 --> 27:50.330
Who?

27:50.365 --> 27:52.800
She didn't say, but she got way mad

27:52.834 --> 27:54.902
when I wouldn't give her your number.

27:54.937 --> 27:56.537
Yeah, I... man, I thought
this girl was nuts...

27:56.572 --> 27:58.372
you know, a crazy fan or something.

27:58.406 --> 28:00.975
Then she asked me how she can
get in touch with Jesse.

28:01.009 --> 28:03.843
Jesse? What does he have to do with this?
I don't know, but...

28:03.878 --> 28:05.579
She was pretty hot to talk to him, too.

28:05.613 --> 28:08.182
So I called Jesse,
and I put him on with her.

28:08.216 --> 28:09.583
What'd she say?

28:09.617 --> 28:12.886
I didn't hear, but she was pretty upset.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.222
And since she ended up dead,
I thought you should know.

28:15.256 --> 28:16.590
(Woman) Hey, Sam!

28:16.624 --> 28:18.692

28:20.728 --> 28:22.095

28:22.129 --> 28:25.398
I don't get it. Did Claire know Jesse?

28:25.432 --> 28:27.200
I don't know. I didn't think she did.

28:27.234 --> 28:28.514
There's only one way to find out.

28:28.535 --> 28:31.270
I'm calling Jesse. Wait.
He could be involved.

28:31.305 --> 28:32.872
If Claire thought someone
was trying to kill you,

28:32.907 --> 28:34.407
do you really think
it's a good idea to call...

28:34.441 --> 28:35.601
anybody ever tell your friend

28:35.609 --> 28:36.742
that she looks like Mandy Sutton?

28:36.776 --> 28:38.277
Yeah, she gets that all the time.

28:38.312 --> 28:40.113
It's a shame what happened
to Mandy, isn't it?

28:40.114 --> 28:41.880
Hey, that <i>is</i> Mandy.

28:41.915 --> 28:43.682
Oh, my God. Mandy Sutton is alive.

28:48.054 --> 28:50.022
There's still no word
on Jesse's whereabouts.

28:50.056 --> 28:51.924
Same with Mandy. But get this...

28:51.958 --> 28:53.225
when I called the limo company

28:53.259 --> 28:55.260
to see if she ordered up
a ride from her hotel tonight,

28:55.294 --> 28:56.862
they said she didn't, but they told me

28:56.896 --> 28:58.363
that I wasn't the only guy
asking that question.

28:58.397 --> 29:00.632
Someone else called?
Yeah, some guy who said

29:00.666 --> 29:02.700
that he was with her management company.

29:02.735 --> 29:04.415
But I checked.
No one there made that call.

29:04.437 --> 29:07.105
Jesse. Maybe he found out
that she was still alive.

29:07.140 --> 29:09.974
Looks like everyone just did.

29:10.009 --> 29:11.943
<i>(Woman on TV) ...That Mandy Sutton,</i>

29:37.969 --> 29:39.303

30:15.038 --> 30:17.273
Yeah, same here. Get in.

30:17.308 --> 30:18.441
I'm not so sure that's a good idea.

30:34.146 --> 30:36.181
Just get out. Out! Now!

30:36.215 --> 30:37.950

30:37.984 --> 30:40.519
Sorry I dragged you into this.

30:40.553 --> 30:41.753
Well... I want answers.

30:41.788 --> 30:43.989
Answers about what?

30:44.023 --> 30:45.104
Someone is messing with me,

30:45.124 --> 30:46.992
and I <i>know you're involved somehow.</i>

30:47.026 --> 30:48.960
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:48.995 --> 30:51.529
Don't lie to me! Guys, let's
just calm down, okay?

30:51.563 --> 30:53.598
I'm sure we can talk this out.

30:53.632 --> 30:54.632
Shut up. Hey!

30:54.666 --> 30:56.701
Jesse, look at me.

30:56.735 --> 30:58.103
I made a mistake.

30:58.137 --> 30:59.871
Okay, I-if you thought whatever happened

30:59.905 --> 31:01.706
the other night between us
meant that we were

31:01.740 --> 31:02.773
getting back together, I'm sorry,

31:02.808 --> 31:04.308
but that's not what's gonna happen.

31:04.342 --> 31:06.443
You know that wasn't you the other night

31:06.478 --> 31:09.146
in that photo. <i>What?</i>

31:09.180 --> 31:10.848
If it wasn't her, then who was it?

31:10.883 --> 31:12.850
It's that chick, Claire.

31:12.885 --> 31:15.553
I got paid 25 grand
to show up and suck face

31:15.587 --> 31:17.021
with her for a couple minutes.

31:17.055 --> 31:19.556
You're telling me that you
really don't know? No!

31:19.590 --> 31:22.859
I was messed up that night.
I don't remember anything.

31:22.894 --> 31:25.062
I don't even remember <i>getting</i> messed up.

31:25.096 --> 31:26.530
Maybe you didn't.

31:26.564 --> 31:28.698
Maybe somebody drugged you
so you wouldn't remember.

31:28.733 --> 31:30.667
And then I-I would see the photos

31:30.701 --> 31:32.802
and assume that it was me? Jesse...

31:32.837 --> 31:34.337
How could you do that to me?

31:34.371 --> 31:37.173
This isn't about you, not anymore.

31:37.207 --> 31:38.909
What happened, Mandy?

31:38.943 --> 31:40.744
Hmm? Who killed Claire?

31:40.778 --> 31:43.680
I don't know.

31:43.714 --> 31:45.015
What do you care?

31:45.049 --> 31:48.752
I care 'cause the cops
are trying to pin it on me.

31:48.786 --> 31:50.819
Someone must have seen me
in the alley that night.

31:50.854 --> 31:52.655
Wait a minute. You were there,

31:52.689 --> 31:55.958
when she was killed?
I had to talk to her.

31:55.992 --> 31:58.227
Now we were supposed to get
another 25 grand

31:58.262 --> 31:59.828
for staging that photo,

31:59.863 --> 32:01.397
if we kept our mouth shut
when the story ran.

32:01.432 --> 32:04.400
Only bitch got a conscience,
felt bad about everything

32:04.435 --> 32:06.334
she had done,
especially 'cause the pictures

32:06.369 --> 32:08.737
broke up you and what's his name... Zach.

32:08.772 --> 32:10.673
She just had to set things right.

32:10.707 --> 32:13.208
That's why she was trying to get
in touch with you last night.

32:13.242 --> 32:15.644
She called me and said she was
going over to <i>your</i> place

32:15.679 --> 32:16.845
to tell you everything.

32:16.880 --> 32:18.681
Only that means I'm not
gonna get my money.

32:18.715 --> 32:20.749
So I go over there
to talk her out of it,

32:20.784 --> 32:23.418
that's it!

32:23.453 --> 32:24.619
And when I get there, she's dead.

32:24.653 --> 32:27.489
Jesse, if you didn't kill Claire,

32:27.523 --> 32:28.923
then put the gun down.

32:28.958 --> 32:31.038
We can go to the police
together and figure this out.

32:31.060 --> 32:32.527
I promise... you're trying to confuse me!

32:32.562 --> 32:34.796
Now shut up before I do
something I... (Sirens wailing)

32:34.830 --> 32:36.631
(Tires screech) (Ryan) Turn
around right now, Jesse!

32:36.665 --> 32:37.699
Drop that gun, Jesse!

32:37.733 --> 32:39.834
(Ryan) Show 'em! Show your hands!

32:39.868 --> 32:42.403
Down! Now, now! (Grunting)

32:42.437 --> 32:44.839
Dad. Hey.

32:44.873 --> 32:47.541
It's okay. It's over.

32:57.586 --> 32:59.487
If Jesse's story is true,
then Claire was about to reveal

32:59.521 --> 33:01.455
that those photos were fake
and someone killed her for it.

33:01.490 --> 33:03.257
So maybe Claire Samuels

33:03.291 --> 33:06.127
was the intended target after all.

33:06.161 --> 33:11.232
If Jesse's story is true.
That's a big "if."

33:11.266 --> 33:14.101
All right, thanks, Bill.
(Hangs up receiver)

33:14.135 --> 33:15.869
So Jesse was telling
the truth about this much...

33:15.903 --> 33:16.970
he deposited $25,000 cash

33:17.005 --> 33:18.538
in his bank account five days ago.

33:18.572 --> 33:19.940
Any more on who paid him?

33:19.974 --> 33:21.274
No, we got a typewritten note

33:21.308 --> 33:23.143
that told him
when to meet Claire at the bar

33:23.177 --> 33:24.945
and where to find the money
at a dead drop.

33:24.979 --> 33:26.312
Why would someone pay that much money

33:26.347 --> 33:27.648
to stage a photo in the first place?

33:27.682 --> 33:28.848
And what was so important about it

33:28.882 --> 33:30.450
that someone would kill Claire

33:30.484 --> 33:33.253
in order to keep it
from being exposed as a fake?

33:33.287 --> 33:34.387
I don't know,

33:34.421 --> 33:35.622
but I could think of someone who might.

33:35.656 --> 33:36.822
Guys, did Jesse tell you

33:36.857 --> 33:38.418
where in the club that photo was taken?

33:38.425 --> 33:40.126
Somewhere in the back hidden from view.

33:40.161 --> 33:42.295
Couldn't be any witnesses,
or the gag wouldn't work.

33:42.329 --> 33:45.230
So that photographer
didn't just happen to be there.

33:45.265 --> 33:46.932
He was in on it.

33:46.967 --> 33:48.467
So who's the photographer?

33:48.501 --> 33:51.303
James Lockhart. How you doin'?

33:51.337 --> 33:54.439
N.Y.P.D. We gotta ask you
some questions, bro.

33:54.474 --> 33:55.675
Listen, can you guys
come back a little later?

33:55.709 --> 33:57.409
Excuse me?

33:57.443 --> 33:59.178
There's an actress in this cafe,
Reese Wellingford?

33:59.212 --> 34:00.680
I've been waiting an hour
for her to come out.

34:00.714 --> 34:02.981
Listen, fool, this is
a criminal investigation.

34:03.015 --> 34:04.183
Who paid you to take

34:04.217 --> 34:05.417
those pictures you sold to "Celebgazer"?

34:05.451 --> 34:06.485
The ones with Jesse Jones

34:06.519 --> 34:08.018
and the girl who wasn't Mandy Sutton?

34:08.054 --> 34:09.521
Nobody paid me.

34:09.556 --> 34:10.955
Oh, really? So you just ended up
in that backroom,

34:10.989 --> 34:12.991
in that bar when those two hooked up?

34:13.025 --> 34:14.958
Yep, just lucky, I guess. Here she is.

34:14.994 --> 34:17.462
Where? I don't even... is
she over... where is it?

34:17.496 --> 34:18.996
Did you see her? I don't even see her.
Is she...

34:19.031 --> 34:21.399
am I... am I in the way?
Oh, you can't, uh, um...

34:21.433 --> 34:24.002
Oh, hey! Oh, there she goes.
She's right there.

34:24.036 --> 34:26.504
Oh, no. Oh. She got in a cab.

34:26.538 --> 34:29.473
All right, look, I got a tip, okay?

34:29.507 --> 34:31.309
They said show up at such
and such time, go in the back.

34:31.342 --> 34:34.679
I got a few shots before security threw me out.
So who gave you that tip?

34:34.713 --> 34:36.880
I can't tell you that.
I thought we were cool.

34:36.915 --> 34:38.449
Oh, come on. You think
I'm gonna rat out my sources?

34:38.483 --> 34:40.484
This is my livelihood.

34:40.518 --> 34:42.199
How do you think
your livelihood's gonna go

34:42.221 --> 34:44.822
with me and my boy here following
you around all day? (Sighs)

34:46.324 --> 34:50.728
Harvey Stryker from
celebgazer.com tipped him off?

34:50.762 --> 34:52.696
He didn't just run that photo
on "Celebgazer,"

34:52.731 --> 34:54.630
he set the whole thing up.

34:54.665 --> 34:56.833
But why? Doesn't this dirtbag
have enough scandals

34:56.868 --> 34:58.435
to report on without
having to make up his own?

34:58.469 --> 35:00.437
Because it wasn't just about
the one scandal.

35:00.471 --> 35:03.306
For years, Mandy has been
drawing millions of eyeballs

35:03.341 --> 35:05.909
to "Celebgazer,"
with her public meltdowns,

35:05.944 --> 35:08.745
or drunken escapades,
the, uh, trips to rehab.

35:08.779 --> 35:10.647
But in the past few months,
she calmed down,

35:10.681 --> 35:11.715
got her life back in order.

35:11.749 --> 35:12.849
Because of Zach.

35:12.883 --> 35:14.583
Which was no good for business.

35:14.618 --> 35:16.886
So Harvey staged the photo,
turns Mandy back

35:16.920 --> 35:19.555
into the train wreck that
he grew to love and exploit.

35:19.589 --> 35:21.290
And it worked, too, until Claire
was gonna ruin it all

35:21.324 --> 35:22.724
by calling the photo out as a hoax,

35:22.726 --> 35:24.693
destroying Harvey's reputation.

35:24.728 --> 35:28.030
And that's why Harvey
was at the apartment.

35:28.065 --> 35:30.031
He wasn't waiting for Mandy.
He was waiting for Claire.

35:30.066 --> 35:31.867
He was waiting to silence her.

35:39.728 --> 35:41.407
Fake? No, no, no, no.

35:41.447 --> 35:42.948
celebgazer.com doesn't do fake.

35:42.983 --> 35:44.616
And yet you ran that one.

35:44.651 --> 35:45.784
Come on, Harvey.

35:45.819 --> 35:47.686
We know you set the whole thing up.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.855
You paid Jesse, then you paid Claire.

35:50.401 --> 35:52.535
I didn't pay anyone. And who is Claire?

35:53.804 --> 35:55.204
(Taps table) The girl in the photo.

35:56.240 --> 35:59.142
The one that you killed
right after she threatened

35:59.177 --> 36:00.210
to expose you?

36:00.244 --> 36:01.378
Wait a minute.

36:01.412 --> 36:03.646
I had nothing to do with any of this.

36:03.681 --> 36:05.949
So then how did you get that photo?

36:05.984 --> 36:07.650
I bought it from a freelancer.

36:07.685 --> 36:08.818
We spoke with him.

36:08.853 --> 36:10.753
He said that you sent him to that bar,

36:10.788 --> 36:14.557
which means you knew
Claire and Jesse were there.

36:14.592 --> 36:16.225
How did you know?

36:16.259 --> 36:18.127
The same way I always know.

36:18.161 --> 36:19.896
I was tipped!

36:19.930 --> 36:21.430
Do you actually expect us
to believe that?

36:21.465 --> 36:22.899
It's true! I swear.

36:22.933 --> 36:24.200
I remember exactly when it happened.

36:24.234 --> 36:26.002
They called my cell. I can show you.

36:26.036 --> 36:28.537
Yo, that phone call Harvey got
came from a burner phone

36:28.571 --> 36:30.006
paid for with cash.

36:30.040 --> 36:31.440
So they were covering their tracks.

36:31.475 --> 36:33.275
Yeah, only they didn't
do a very good job of it.

36:33.310 --> 36:34.643
They forgot to disable the G.P.S.

36:34.677 --> 36:36.612
We were able to track the G.P.S. data.

36:36.646 --> 36:37.946
Yeah. That phone was in the
alley behind Mandy's building

36:37.981 --> 36:39.348
the night of the murder.

36:39.383 --> 36:42.784
So then whoever bought that phone

36:42.819 --> 36:44.620
is our killer.

36:44.654 --> 36:47.523
Thank you for coming in.
We, uh, we just wanted

36:47.557 --> 36:50.258
to keep you up-to-date
on the investigation.

36:50.292 --> 36:51.760
So there's been a development?

36:51.794 --> 36:53.361
Yes, we have a lead.

36:53.396 --> 36:56.297
We've identified
the cell phone of the person

36:56.332 --> 36:58.099
that set up that fake photo.

36:58.134 --> 37:00.968
And we believe the same person
killed Claire Samuels.

37:01.003 --> 37:02.270
Who is it?

37:02.304 --> 37:04.005
Well, actually, it was a burner phone.

37:04.040 --> 37:06.174
A burner phone?

37:06.208 --> 37:07.542
So it's not traceable.

37:07.576 --> 37:09.044
Uh, normally, it wouldn't be.

37:09.078 --> 37:10.211
But the person who bought this phone

37:10.246 --> 37:12.647
made one crucial mistake.

37:12.681 --> 37:15.315
They didn't get rid of it
when they were done.

37:15.350 --> 37:18.052
Matter of fact, it's still on right now.

37:18.086 --> 37:19.153
(Beep)

37:19.187 --> 37:24.559
(Cell phone rings)

37:24.593 --> 37:27.628
Mom? (Ring)

37:30.131 --> 37:32.066
(Ring)

37:32.100 --> 37:35.069
Mom!

37:35.103 --> 37:38.472
You set up that photo?

37:38.506 --> 37:40.340
You did this to me?
Why would you do that?

37:40.375 --> 37:41.708
Why do you wanna ruin my life?

37:41.742 --> 37:44.744
It was Zach who was ruining your life.

37:44.779 --> 37:46.413
I was saving you.

37:46.448 --> 37:49.315
Wait a minute. Wait. You did this

37:49.349 --> 37:50.750
to break me up with Zach?

37:50.785 --> 37:53.753
He was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

37:53.788 --> 37:56.522
He was gonna take me away
from all of this.

37:56.557 --> 37:59.358
That's right, away from
everything we'd worked for...

37:59.393 --> 38:00.961
your tour, your career,

38:00.995 --> 38:03.229
he was gonna cost you millions.

38:03.263 --> 38:05.664
You mean cost <i>you</i> millions?

38:05.699 --> 38:07.100
And for what?

38:07.134 --> 38:08.634
A chance to be normal!

38:08.668 --> 38:09.835
(Scoffs) Normal.

38:09.869 --> 38:11.537
You're special.

38:11.572 --> 38:13.272
Zach didn't understand that.

38:13.307 --> 38:16.742
And neither did Claire.

38:16.776 --> 38:19.612
So you... killed her?

38:19.646 --> 38:23.082
She was gonna tell you what I'd done.

38:23.116 --> 38:26.118
She was gonna make you hate me.

38:26.152 --> 38:28.687
I couldn't let her
drive a wedge between us.

38:28.722 --> 38:30.422
I couldn't.

38:30.456 --> 38:32.057
Marilyn Sutton, please stand up.

38:32.092 --> 38:34.226
(Handcuffs clink)

38:34.260 --> 38:36.228
Turn around.

38:36.262 --> 38:37.262
You're under arrest for the murder

38:37.296 --> 38:38.597
of Claire Samuels. (Handcuffs click)

38:38.631 --> 38:43.401
(Exhales) Mandy, sweetie,
you understand, right?

38:44.903 --> 38:48.340
I did this for you, Mandy.

38:48.374 --> 38:50.142
Everything I did, I did for you.

38:50.176 --> 38:53.277
No, mom.

38:53.311 --> 38:55.613
You did it for <i>you.</i>

38:58.517 --> 39:01.585
(Beckett) Let's go.

39:03.822 --> 39:05.523
Just when I thought

39:05.557 --> 39:07.959
life couldn't get any more
messed up, right? (Scoffs)

39:07.993 --> 39:12.729
And the train wreck continues.
The press is gonna love this.

39:12.764 --> 39:18.369
Sorry. I'm gonna go.

39:18.403 --> 39:19.970
Thank you.

39:20.004 --> 39:25.042
Um, hey, Mandy. Sorry, um, not to pry,

39:25.076 --> 39:29.179
but, uh, it would be really
easy just to run and hide

39:29.213 --> 39:30.981
from all this.

39:31.015 --> 39:33.349
But don't.

39:33.384 --> 39:35.719
Thanks.

39:37.689 --> 39:42.725
Thank you for all you guys did.

39:42.759 --> 39:45.861
Um, could you thank Alexis
for me, too, please?

39:45.896 --> 39:47.297
I will. Yeah, she was here.

39:47.331 --> 39:49.765
Actually, I don't know
where she went. There's, oh...

39:49.800 --> 39:53.536
I'm back, and I've brought
someone with me.

39:53.571 --> 39:55.004
Hey, Mandy.

39:55.038 --> 39:57.006
Zach.

40:01.178 --> 40:04.080
(Sighs)

40:04.114 --> 40:06.682
Once we realized Mandy
hadn't really cheated on him,

40:06.717 --> 40:08.718
I tracked him down.

40:08.752 --> 40:10.052
I thought he needed to know.

40:10.087 --> 40:12.354
(Mouths words) (Castle) Good.

40:12.388 --> 40:15.357
I hope it works out for them.

40:15.391 --> 40:17.659
Mandy needs something good in her life.

40:17.694 --> 40:19.494
They've got a shot.

40:19.529 --> 40:22.331
They seem to really love each other

40:22.365 --> 40:23.832
for all the right reasons.

40:23.866 --> 40:27.135
Oh, um, speaking of boyfriends...

40:27.169 --> 40:28.370
(Paper rustles)

40:28.404 --> 40:31.005
Pi's letter of recommendation.

40:33.008 --> 40:36.177
He did get the deadline extended, right?

40:36.212 --> 40:37.678
No, he did.

40:37.713 --> 40:40.281
Good.

40:40.315 --> 40:42.383
How did I spell "Pi"?
Did I put it like the dessert?

40:42.417 --> 40:43.785
'Cause that was just... no, dad.

40:43.819 --> 40:47.188
You got it right. Okay. (Chuckles)

40:47.223 --> 40:50.190
(Sighs) I'm just not sure I did.

40:50.225 --> 40:53.427
Where... where you off to?

40:53.462 --> 40:59.333
There's something I need to do.

40:59.368 --> 41:01.034
Hey, Castle,

41:01.069 --> 41:03.537
looks like your love life
made the paper again.

41:03.572 --> 41:05.538
Ah, what? All right.

41:05.573 --> 41:08.075
All right, who am I hooking up with now?

41:08.109 --> 41:11.211
"Novelist Richard Castle
and New York police detective

41:11.246 --> 41:13.747
"Katherine Beckett,
both native New Yorkers,

41:13.782 --> 41:15.448
are pleased to announce
their engagement."

41:15.483 --> 41:17.951
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

41:17.986 --> 41:19.253
I didn't... I did...

41:19.287 --> 41:21.221
I didn't do this.

41:21.256 --> 41:23.757
Actually, I did.

41:25.826 --> 41:28.695
I thought you... I know, I know, Castle.
I like my privacy.

41:28.729 --> 41:30.963
But I do realize
that you're somewhat famous.

41:30.998 --> 41:32.432
Somewhat? (Scoffs) I...

41:33.567 --> 41:35.735
yes. And if we're gonna be together,

41:35.770 --> 41:37.970
I have to come to terms with that,

41:38.005 --> 41:39.538
and if they are gonna write about you,

41:39.572 --> 41:45.111
I want it to be the truth.
I want it to be about us.

41:45.145 --> 41:46.846
Well, there's no one I...

41:50.717 --> 41:52.751
there's no one I'd rather
share a headline with.

41:52.786 --> 41:54.753
But just for the interest of accuracy...

41:54.788 --> 41:56.388
(Paper rustles)

41:56.423 --> 41:58.156
Does it say we're getting
married in space?

41:58.191 --> 42:00.292
No, it's not gonna happen, babe.

42:03.029 --> 42:06.631
Be pretty fun.

42:06.665 --> 42:08.233
Space.
