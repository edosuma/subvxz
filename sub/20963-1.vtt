05:44.470 --> 05:45.980
in the world to me.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.610
I wished for you so much so,

05:48.680 --> 05:50.750
I sculpted you
from clay myself,

05:50.810 --> 05:53.550
and begged Zeus
to give you life.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.750
You've told me this story.

05:55.820 --> 05:59.990
Which is why tonight
I will tell you a new one.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.390
A story of our people,
and my days of battle.

06:03.460 --> 06:04.560
Yes!

06:04.630 --> 06:06.600
So you will
finally understand

06:06.660 --> 06:08.230
why war is nothing
to hope for.

06:14.470 --> 06:17.670
Long ago, when time was new

06:17.740 --> 06:20.710
and all of history
was still a dream,

06:20.780 --> 06:23.410
the gods ruled the Earth,

06:23.480 --> 06:26.080
Zeus king among them.

06:28.420 --> 06:32.390
Zeus created beings over which
the gods would rule.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.820
Beings born in his image,

06:34.890 --> 06:39.360
fair and good,
strong and passionate.

06:39.430 --> 06:44.500
He called his creation "man."
And mankind was good.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.700
But Zeus's son
grew envious of mankind

06:47.770 --> 06:51.270
and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.

06:52.280 --> 06:55.810
This was Ares, the God of War.

06:57.510 --> 07:02.090
Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.

07:02.150 --> 07:04.450
He turned them
against one another

07:04.520 --> 07:08.390
and war ravaged the Earth.

07:08.460 --> 07:12.600
So, the gods created us,
the Amazons,

07:12.660 --> 07:15.460
to influence
men's hearts with love

07:15.530 --> 07:18.030
and restore peace
to the Earth.

07:20.740 --> 07:24.310
And for a brief time,
there was peace.

<font color="#ff5500">ANTIOPE : But it did not last.</font>

07:38.190 --> 07:41.860
Your mother, the Amazon Queen,
led a revolt

07:41.930 --> 07:45.060
that freed us all
from enslavement.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.470
When Zeus led the gods
to our defense,

07:55.540 --> 07:58.710
Ares killed them one by one,

07:58.780 --> 08:03.180

remained.

the God of War
was forced to retreat.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.190
But Zeus knew

08:16.260 --> 08:20.560
that one day, Ares might
return to finish his mission.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.930
An endless war

08:23.000 --> 08:26.440

destroy themselves,

from the outside world,

Ares could not find us.

08:49.660 --> 08:52.030
And all has been quiet
ever since.

for giving us this paradise.

I cannot stop you.

37:08.590 --> 37:11.390
There is so much...

37:11.460 --> 37:12.660
So much
you do not understand.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.500
I understand enough.

37:14.560 --> 37:15.930
That I'm willing to fight

37:16.000 --> 37:18.600
for those who cannot fight
for themselves.

37:20.640 --> 37:22.670

37:22.740 --> 37:24.910
You know that
if you choose to leave,

37:26.510 --> 37:28.410
you may never return.

37:29.710 --> 37:31.910
Who will I be if I stay?

37:40.390 --> 37:44.160
This belonged to the greatest
warrior in our history,

37:44.230 --> 37:46.690
our beloved Antiope.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.430
Make sure
you are worthy of it.

I will.

of men, Diana.

They do not deserve you.

38:06.010 --> 38:09.420
You have been
my greatest love.

38:13.220 --> 38:14.560
Today,

38:16.390 --> 38:19.460
you are my greatest sorrow.

38:57.300 --> 38:59.200

38:59.270 --> 39:04.040
The more she knows,
the sooner he'll find her.

39:15.550 --> 39:17.750
How long until
we reach the war?

39:18.590 --> 39:20.720
The war? Which part?

39:20.790 --> 39:22.260
The Western Front in France

39:22.320 --> 39:23.460
is 400 miles long

39:23.530 --> 39:24.930
from the Alps
to the North Sea.

39:26.260 --> 39:28.330
Where the fighting
is the most intense, then.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.630
If you take me there,
I'm sure I'll find Ares.

39:35.370 --> 39:37.670
Ares? As in, the God of War?

39:37.740 --> 39:39.940
The God of War
is our responsibility.

40:01.400 --> 40:04.200
It's a great big mess.

40:04.270 --> 40:07.170
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

40:07.230 --> 40:08.700
I mean, we can get back
to London,

40:08.770 --> 40:10.240

to the men who can.

No.

I glimpsed the darkness

that lives
within their light

02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:38.530

there will always be both.
