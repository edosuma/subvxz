17:44.646 --> 17:46.482

REMEMBER SEEING YOU.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.734
I WALK HER TILL
SHE'S A BLOCK AWAY.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.444
I DON'T DEAL
WITH HER PARENTS.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.820
WHY NOT?

17:51.820 --> 17:53.947
THEY DON'T LIKE US
HANGING OUT.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.616
WE DID<i> NOT </i>HAVE SEX.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.950

17:56.950 --> 17:59.078

ARE SAYING THAT WE DID,

YOU AND WAN YI DUCK IN THERE
AND NOT HAVE SEX?

18:09.963 --> 18:12.174
NO. I TOLD YOU,
WE<i> NEVER </i>HAD SEX.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.760
YOU AND WAN YI GET
INTO A FIGHT ABOUT SOMETHING?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.553
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T PUT
OUT FOR YOU?

18:16.553 --> 18:19.223
WE WENT BEHIND A BUILDING,
AND WE STARTED KISSING,

18:19.223 --> 18:21.558
AND WE'VE MADE OUT BEFORE.

18:21.558 --> 18:24.686
AND, YOU KNOW,
I PUT MY HAND DOWN THERE,

18:24.686 --> 18:27.314
AND SHE FREAKED OUT
AND STARTED CRYING.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.817
AND YOU KEPT HER QUIET
BY PUTTING YOUR HANDS
AROUND HER NECK.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.527
NO! SHE RAN HOME.

18:31.527 --> 18:35.447
WE FOUND WAN YI'S BODY
IN THE VACANT LOT
THIS MORNING.

18:35.447 --> 18:36.615
NO WAY.

18:36.615 --> 18:37.699
WHAT HAPPENED, TRAVIS?

18:37.699 --> 18:39.201
NO WAY!

18:39.201 --> 18:41.787
WE CAN HELP YOU OUT,
BUT YOU GOTTA TELL US THE TRUTH

18:41.787 --> 18:42.830
ABOUT HOW IT GOT OUT
OF HAND.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.581
WHAT? HOW WHAT
GOT OUT OF HAND?

18:44.581 --> 18:46.959
I DIDN'T KILL WAN YI!
ARE YOU CRAZY?!

18:46.959 --> 18:49.962
HOW'D HER PURSE GET
INTO YOUR BACKPACK, TRAVIS?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.338
I'D HOLD ONTO IT FOR HER

18:51.338 --> 18:53.215
'CAUSE HER PARENTS DIDN'T
ALLOW HER WEARING MAKEUP.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.008
YOU GOT A TEMPER?
NO.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.135
WE LOOKED AT YOUR RECORD.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.679
WE READ HOW YOU
SANK A PAIR OF SCISSORS

18:58.679 --> 19:00.180
INTO A CLASSMATE LAST MONTH.

19:00.180 --> 19:03.016
WHAT ABOUT HE HAD A KNIFE
AND HE WAS ARRESTED, TOO?

19:03.016 --> 19:04.351
WHO'D WANT TO HURT
WAN YI, THEN?

19:04.351 --> 19:06.270
HER FAMILY!
THEY HATED HER!

19:06.270 --> 19:07.646
WHY?

19:07.646 --> 19:10.607
SHE WAS A SECOND DAUGHTER,
AND THEY WANTED TO HAVE A SON.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.527
YOU CAN'T HAVE THREE KIDS
IN CHINA OR SOME KIND OF DEAL,

19:13.527 --> 19:16.405
SO THEY SHOVED HER OFF
ON HER AUNT.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.198
AND THEN HER PARENTS
HAD A SON,

19:18.198 --> 19:20.617
BUT WHEN THEY WANTED
TO COME OUT TO THE U.S.,

19:20.617 --> 19:23.370
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
SAID THEY HAD TO LEAVE
WITH ALL THEIR CHILDREN,

19:23.370 --> 19:25.205
SO THEY<i> HAD </i>TO TAKE
WAN YI BACK.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.456
LOOK, THEY HATED HER.

19:26.456 --> 19:29.042
HER SISTER WAS ALWAYS
TELLING HER TO RUN AWAY,

19:29.042 --> 19:31.670
HOW WAN YI WAS BRINGING
DOWN THE FAMILY,

19:31.670 --> 19:34.548
AND HER PARENTS WERE ALWAYS
BEATING ON HER ASS.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.425
HER OLDER SISTER
GOES TO ST. JOHN'S?

19:36.425 --> 19:37.718
YEAH.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.180
I DIDN'T KILL WAN YI.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.391
I LOVED HER.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.979
ANY LUCK FINDING LENNY?

19:48.979 --> 19:51.899
YEAH, WE GOT HIM IN.
TAKE A SEAT.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.610
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT WITH ME?

19:54.610 --> 19:57.070
THIS MORNING, YOU SAID
YOU NEVER SAW LENNY SOCIALLY.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.281
YOU SURE THAT'S THE TRUTH?
YEAH.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.949
YOU NEVER CALLED LENNY
AND ASKED HIM TO COME OVER?

20:00.949 --> 20:01.992
JUST YOU AND HIM, ALONE?

20:01.992 --> 20:03.619
NO.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.079
THERE'S SOME DISCREPANCIES IN
YOUR STORY THAT SAY DIFFERENT.

20:06.079 --> 20:10.042
WE GOT SOURCES WHO SAY YOU WERE
GETTING TOGETHER FOR TWO MONTHS.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.460
WHO SAID THAT?

20:11.460 --> 20:13.795
I'D BE MORE CONCERNED
WITH LOOKING AT A COLLAR

20:13.795 --> 20:17.216
FOR TRYING TO SEND A GUY TO JAIL
WHO DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.550
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH RAPE?

20:18.550 --> 20:20.928
ONLY IF IT
ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.512
WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP LIKE
WITH YOUR FIANCé?

20:22.512 --> 20:23.513
IT'S FINE.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.015
HAS HE GOT A TEMPER?
NO.

20:25.015 --> 20:28.435
SO THIS MORNING, THAT WAS
THE FIRST YOU'VE SEEN OF IT?

20:28.435 --> 20:30.062
HE HAD A RIGHT TO BE MAD.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.731
WHEN HE GETS MAD,
DOES HE GET DANGEROUS?

20:32.731 --> 20:34.942
I DON'T KNOW.

20:34.942 --> 20:38.320
JOSIE, LYING ABOUT THE RAPE
GAVE RAY TIME TO COOL OFF

20:38.320 --> 20:40.030
AND GET SOME DISTANCE
BETWEEN HIM AND LENNY.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.032
THAT WORKED
FOR THE TIME BEING,

20:42.032 --> 20:45.202
BUT NOW YOU GOTTA MAKE THINGS
RIGHT BY TELLING THE TRUTH.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.663
OR WE'LL FIND SOMEBODY WHO
SAW YOU AND LENNY TOGETHER.

20:47.663 --> 20:51.458
WE'LL PROVE YOU'RE LYING.
DON'T LET IT GET THAT FAR.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.877
THIS WAS NOTHING
AGAINST LENNY.

20:53.877 --> 20:55.087
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:55.087 --> 20:57.965
LENNY LOST HIS MOM TWO
MONTHS AGO,

20:57.965 --> 21:00.717
AND I WAS TRYING
TO BE SOME COMFORT.

21:00.717 --> 21:03.345
YOU WERE HAVING
CONSENSUAL SEX. THEN WHAT?

21:03.345 --> 21:05.597
RAY CAME IN, AND HE WOULD
HAVE KILLED US BOTH.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.140
SO MAYBE I DID LENNY
A FAVOR.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.601
HE MIGHT SEE IT DIFFERENTLY.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.562
AM I STILL GETTING ARRESTED?

21:12.562 --> 21:13.730
WE'LL SEE.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.649
WRITE WHAT HAPPENED.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.904
DID YOU KICK THE SUSPECT,
LENNY GANNO?

21:20.904 --> 21:23.323
HE'S A COLLAR ON A
FAILURE-TO-APPEAR WARRANT.

21:23.323 --> 21:25.826
AND HOW DO WE FEEL
ABOUT COLLARING JOSIE THOMS?

21:25.826 --> 21:27.411
DO IT.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.746
HER DEFENSE WILL SAY SHE
THOUGHT HER LIFE WAS IN DANGER.

21:29.746 --> 21:31.581
WELL, MENTION HOW LENNY GANNO
COULD HAVE GOT SHOT.

21:31.581 --> 21:33.375
AND SHE WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN IN DANGER

21:33.375 --> 21:35.085
IF SHE HADN'T BEEN SCREWING
AROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.920
THIS IS A GROWN WOMAN
WHO KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING

21:36.920 --> 21:39.047
AND COST US
AT LEAST 24 MAN-HOURS.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.173
SHE'S A COLLAR.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.426
I'LL DRAW IT UP.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.720
WE'LL GIVE JOSIE THE NEWS.

21:49.599 --> 21:50.684
COFFEE?

22:02.112 --> 22:03.780
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

22:03.780 --> 22:05.907
BUSY.

22:05.907 --> 22:06.950
YOU?

22:06.950 --> 22:08.410
SAME.

22:08.410 --> 22:12.664
IT'S NOT RIGHT WE DON'T
TALK EVEN TO SAY HELLO.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.125
I GUESS WE'RE
FINDING OUR WAY.

22:15.125 --> 22:18.795
I KNOW<i> I </i>STILL GOT
SOME THINGS TO GET PAST.

22:18.795 --> 22:21.715
I ADMIT, I COULD HAVE HANDLED
THE PREGNANCY BETTER.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.384
I WASN'T READY FOR IT.

22:24.384 --> 22:26.470
WE JUST HADN'T BEEN
TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.804
MAYBE.

22:27.804 --> 22:29.973
I STILL THINK ABOUT YOU.

22:29.973 --> 22:33.185
I THINK ABOUT YOU, TOO,
BUT WE NEED THIS TIME.

22:35.562 --> 22:36.688
I SHOULD GET GOING.

22:36.688 --> 22:40.525
I'M GONNA SAY HELLO
WHEN I SEE YOU.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.694
I'LL SAY HELLO BACK.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.627
WE'RE VERY SORRY ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOUR SISTER.

22:58.627 --> 22:59.586
THANK YOU.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.340
SO YOU'RE A FRESHMAN
AT ST. JOHN'S.
YES.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.801
BUT YOU LIVE AT HOME,
YES.

23:05.801 --> 23:06.802
SO YOU WERE AROUND?

23:06.802 --> 23:08.595
I MEAN, YOU SAW YOUR
SISTER EVERY DAY?

23:08.595 --> 23:09.846
I GUESS SO.

23:09.846 --> 23:12.182
YOU GET ALONG
WITH YOUR SISTER?
SURE.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.101
YOU KNOW ANYBODY
WHO'D WANT TO HURT HER?

23:14.101 --> 23:16.269
SHE'D HANG OUT WITH TRASH,

23:16.269 --> 23:18.438
AND SHE HAD THIS STUPID
BOYFRIEND, TRAVIS.

23:18.438 --> 23:19.648
TALK TO HIM.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.525
HOW WERE THINGS AROUND THE HOUSE
FOR YOUR SISTER?

23:21.525 --> 23:22.984
FINE. WHY?

23:22.984 --> 23:24.361
SHE GOT ALONG
WITH YOUR PARENTS?

23:24.361 --> 23:26.071
YES. TALK TO TRAVIS.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.407
Clark: WE'RE HEARING THAT WAN YI
DIDN'T HAVE A HAPPY HOME LIFE.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.617
WE HEAR THAT YOU TWO
DIDN'T GET ALONG AT ALL.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.160
SO?

23:32.160 --> 23:34.162
I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY YOU'D
LIE ABOUT THAT TO BEGIN WITH.

23:34.162 --> 23:36.081
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS,
MAYBE?

23:36.081 --> 23:39.000
DEAD PEOPLE HAPPENS
TO BE OUR BUSINESS.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.877
OKAY. SO MAYBE
THERE WERE ARGUMENTS.

23:40.877 --> 23:41.920
OVER WHAT?

23:41.920 --> 23:43.422
I DON'T KNOW.
THINGS.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.633
OVER YOUR PARENTS NOT WANTING
TO BRING WAN YI OUT FROM CHINA?

23:46.633 --> 23:48.468
DID YOU TELL YOUR SISTER
TO RUN AWAY,

23:48.468 --> 23:50.262
THAT YOU'D BE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT HER?

23:50.262 --> 23:53.723
YES, BECAUSE THAT WAS THE TRUTH.
SHE WAS A STRANGER TO US.

23:53.723 --> 23:56.685
NOW THERE ARE THREE
CHILDREN TO PAY FOR.

23:56.685 --> 23:57.811
WAN YI NEEDED TO LEAVE.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.188
AT 14 YEARS OLD?
SHE WAS RUINING EVERYTHING.

24:00.188 --> 24:02.983
DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH YOUR SISTER GETTING KILLED?

24:02.983 --> 24:04.359
NO.

24:04.359 --> 24:06.987
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY
WHO WAS INVOLVED?
NO.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.239
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.
TALK TO TRAVIS.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.407
WE ARE.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.325
GOOD.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.869
NOW, I HAVE A MIDTERM
IN THREE HOURS.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.078
I HAVE TO GO.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.580
WHEN A SIBLING'S MURDERED,

24:16.580 --> 24:18.665
SCHOOLS USUALLY LET
MIDTERMS SLIDE.

24:18.665 --> 24:19.666
I HAVE TO GO.

24:19.666 --> 24:20.584
THEN GO.

24:29.384 --> 24:31.344
Connie: OTHER DAUGHTER
GIVE YOU ANYTHING?

24:31.344 --> 24:33.263
SOMETHING'S UP
WITH THAT FAMILY.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.682
WE NEED TO TALK
TO THE DAD AGAIN.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.350
Connie: MEDAVOY AND JONES
ARE HEADING OVER

24:37.350 --> 24:39.269
TO TALK TO BOTH EMPLOYERS
OF THE DAD.

24:39.269 --> 24:41.480
THE M.E. JUST FINISHED THE
AUTOPSY ON YOUR D.O.A.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.399
HE FOUND FRESH SCARS ON HER BACK
CRISSCROSSING OLDER ONES.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.650
COULD THEY TELL HOW OLD?

24:45.650 --> 24:47.944
NO, BUT SHE'D BEEN GETTING
BEAT FOR A WHILE.

24:47.944 --> 24:49.321
I'LL PAGE MEDAVOY AND JONES,

24:49.321 --> 24:51.406
FILL THEM IN BEFORE THEY
TALK TO THE DAD.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.414
JOHN?

24:59.414 --> 25:01.333
COME ON.

25:06.129 --> 25:07.380
YES?

25:07.380 --> 25:09.591
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

25:09.591 --> 25:10.759
NOTHING.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.636
YOUR SISTER COMES IN,
AND SINCE THEN,

25:12.636 --> 25:14.221
YOU ACT LIKE YOU'VE
BEEN POLEAXED.

25:14.221 --> 25:15.347
WHAT HAPPENED?

25:19.768 --> 25:23.563
IS THIS ABOUT YOUR,
UH, BOYFRIEND?

25:23.563 --> 25:25.315
MY DAD.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.858
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

25:26.858 --> 25:28.068
HE'S DYING.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.574
I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT, JOHN.

25:34.574 --> 25:37.953
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
WHERE IS HE?

25:37.953 --> 25:39.204
HERE.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.248
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM YET?

25:41.248 --> 25:42.541
NO.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.460
YOU WAITING TILL END OF TOUR?
GET OVER THERE.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.170
I'M NOT GOING.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.838
WHY NOT?

25:48.838 --> 25:50.215
WE DON'T TALK.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.801
I THOUGHT YOU HAD A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR DAD.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.970
I LIED ABOUT THAT.

25:54.970 --> 25:58.098
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE
TO REVISIT THE WHOLE THING.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.724
SO YOU'RE NOT CLOSE.

25:59.724 --> 26:02.394
WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN
IN FIVE YEARS.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.271
OVER YOU BEING GAY?

26:04.271 --> 26:05.647
YES.

26:05.647 --> 26:08.483
OKAY, NOW, LISTEN.

26:08.483 --> 26:13.029
ME AND ANDY JR., WE HADN'T
TALKED IN A LONG TIME, EITHER.

26:13.029 --> 26:15.865
EACH OF US THOUGHT THAT
THE OTHER ONE WAS DUG IN.

26:15.865 --> 26:19.578
I THOUGHT HE HATED ME
BECAUSE I LET HIM DOWN,

26:19.578 --> 26:23.748
BUT AS SOON AS I SAW HIM --
WHICH HE TOOK THE INITIATIVE,

26:23.748 --> 26:26.376
AND I WILL ALWAYS BE
SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID --

26:26.376 --> 26:28.920
ALL THE GARBAGE
JUST WENT AWAY.

26:28.920 --> 26:32.048
MY FATHER DOESN'T
CONSIDER ME HIS SON ANYMORE.

26:32.048 --> 26:36.136
I JUST PICTURE HIM ASKING ME
TO LEAVE, HAVING ME REMOVED.

26:36.136 --> 26:38.680
JOHN, YOU HAVE A TENDENCY
OF OVER-THINKING THINGS,

26:38.680 --> 26:40.640
GOING WORST-CASE SCENARIO.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.685
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN HURT A LOT
IN MY LIFE, DETECTIVE.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.855
YEAH. I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.

26:46.855 --> 26:50.025
MY MOM AND I WERE ALWAYS CLOSE,
AND SHE ALWAYS KNEW,

26:50.025 --> 26:52.193
AND I GUESS SHE
WAS A BUFFER BETWEEN US,

26:52.193 --> 26:54.195
BUT AFTER SHE PASSED,

26:54.195 --> 26:57.699
THE THINGS HE SAID TO ME...

26:57.699 --> 27:00.910
GUYS OF MY GENERATION,
A LOT OF US,

27:00.910 --> 27:02.454
WE GOT OUR VIEWS,

27:02.454 --> 27:04.205
AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS,

27:04.205 --> 27:06.958
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT IF YOU WERE MY KID

27:06.958 --> 27:09.502
AND WE HADN'T TALKED
IN ALL THAT TIME

27:09.502 --> 27:12.756
AND I COULD SENSE MY RIDE
COMING TO THE END,

27:12.756 --> 27:16.968
I'D WANT TO SEE YOU
IF WAS ABLE TO SAY SO OR NOT.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.643
[ SIGHS ]

27:24.643 --> 27:26.895
[ DOOR OPENS ]

27:30.899 --> 27:33.234
EXCUSE ME, SIR.
I'M LOOKING FOR MR. KWAN.

27:37.113 --> 27:38.406
MR. KWAN?

27:38.406 --> 27:40.617
WE NEED TO HAVE A MINUTE
WITH YOU.

27:40.617 --> 27:41.910
NO TIME.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.078
YOU NEED TO MAKE SOME TIME.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.747
NO TIME, AND YOU NEED TO GO.
MAKE ME LOSE MY JOB.

27:45.747 --> 27:48.625
WE HAVE QUESTIONS REGARDING
THE DEATH OF YOUR DAUGHTER.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.210
SHE GONE.
NOTHING I CAN DO.

27:50.210 --> 27:53.213
STILL HAVE WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN
TO MAKE MONEY FOR.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.756
MR. KWAN, WE'RE GONNA TALK,

27:54.756 --> 27:57.884
SO IT'S EITHER HERE AND YOU CAN
GO RIGHT BACK TO WORK,

27:57.884 --> 27:59.386
OR WE'RE GONNA
TAKE A DRIVE.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.846
I TOLD THE OTHER TWO POLICEMEN
EVERYTHING ALREADY.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.683
WHAT KIND OF A RELATIONSHIP DID
YOU HAVE WITH YOUR DAUGHTER?

28:04.683 --> 28:06.184
EVERYTHING FINE.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.727
YOU EVER HAVE
TO PUNISH HER?
NO.

28:07.727 --> 28:09.229
WHO DID?
NO ONE.

28:09.229 --> 28:12.232
WAN YI HAPPY GIRL.
THAT'S A LIE, MR. KWAN.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.275
THERE WERE PROBLEMS
WITH WAN YI AT YOUR HOME.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.152
NO PROBLEMS.

28:16.152 --> 28:19.114
IF YOU'RE GONNA KEEP LYING,
YOU'RE COMING IN WITH US.
I HAVE TO WORK!

28:19.114 --> 28:21.825
AND WE HAVE TO FIND OUT WHO
KILLED YOUR DAUGHTER.
OR DO YOU GIVE A DAMN?

28:21.825 --> 28:27.163
I AM SAD, BUT I DON'T
KNOW HOW SHE DIE,

28:27.163 --> 28:31.167
AND THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO
NOW EXCEPT KEEP WORKING.

28:31.167 --> 28:33.169
YOU CAN ALSO START
TELLING THE TRUTH,

28:33.169 --> 28:35.547
'CAUSE YOUR DAUGHTER
HAD MARKS ON HER BACK

28:35.547 --> 28:38.049
FROM BEING BEATEN
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

28:38.049 --> 28:39.551
DID YOU HIT HER?

28:39.551 --> 28:43.513
WHEN SHE COME HOME LATE OR WEAR
MAKEUP LIKE A WHORE.

28:43.513 --> 28:44.681
WHEN DID YOU SEE HER LAST?

28:44.681 --> 28:46.641
TWO DAYS AGO.
SHE NOT COME HOME.

28:46.641 --> 28:48.518
WE CALL POLICE
THE NEXT DAY.

28:48.518 --> 28:50.186
WE STOPPED BY
YOUR OTHER JOB.

28:50.186 --> 28:52.939
YOU WERE AN HOUR LATE
TO WORK TWO DAYS AGO.
WHERE WERE YOU?

28:52.939 --> 28:55.442
LATE BECAUSE I
HAVE TWO JOBS,

28:55.442 --> 28:58.319
AND EVERYONE NEEDS MONEY,
AND I GET NO SLEEP.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.947
AND MORE PROBLEMS
WITH MORE PROBLEMS.

29:00.947 --> 29:03.908
