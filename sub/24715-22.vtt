ANDY: <i>Previously on </i>NYPD Blue.

00:03.003 --> 00:04.921
I looked in the hall
and saw my dad put my mom

00:05.046 --> 00:06.464
in a shopping cart. She was dead.

00:06.673 --> 00:10.260
A friend of yours broke the jaw
of another schoolmate,

00:10.427 --> 00:12.429
and you were questioned
by the police about it.

00:12.554 --> 00:13.555
Sean was my friend.

00:14.055 --> 00:15.765
And you have lied to the police before.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.351
Jen, what did you do?
How many of these did you take?

00:18.518 --> 00:20.061
-All of them.
-Put a rush on an ambulance

00:20.186 --> 00:23.273
to 1422 West 58th Street, Apartment 2-B.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.775
I can’t lose you like this.
I can’t lose someone else

00:25.859 --> 00:28.653
-I care for... like this.
-Like your dad?

00:28.862 --> 00:32.282
That nearly killed me, losing him
like I did. Please let me help you.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.586
Thanks for picking me up.
I know it’s early.

00:44.669 --> 00:47.130
No, I was up early anyway.
Andy and Connie had their baby.

00:48.048 --> 00:52.052
-That’s great. Boy or girl?
-A boy. Uh, Matthew Nicholas.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.138
It’s nice when people have babies.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.806
It’s the best thing
that can happen in a hospital.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.101
-You okay for time?
-I’m fine.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.728
’Cause I’m ready in two minutes.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.938
I just didn’t want to face
the apartment right away.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.316
I tried to clean it up as much as I could.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.985
Walls still red?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.322
-That’s what I wasn’t ready to face.
-I’ll help you paint this weekend.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.324
Thanks.

01:15.784 --> 01:16.826
I’m okay now.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.455
I feel much more optimistic,
in spite of the realities.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.083
The realities are your health is back
and you got a good friend.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.878
And no money and no job,
and no prospects for a job.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.672
We’ll work something out. All right,
I’ll help you till you’re settled.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.092
I’ve taken enough from you.
I can’t take your money.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.802
Jen, I just don’t want it
getting you down.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.679
It won’t, as long as
I’ve got my good friend.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.642
You do.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.769
Then, I’m ready when you are.

01:44.437 --> 01:47.524
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

01:51.444 --> 01:54.114
Thanks for everything, John. Everything.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.836
-What do we got?
-Leslie Moss.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.964
Robbed, took a blow to the head.
Looks like she was running from it.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.175
-Why is that?
-Where it hit her, the way she’s turned.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.344
-I could be wrong.
-Or not.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.472
I’m asking ’cause I’m a little foggy.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.891
-Yeah?
-Yeah, late night.

02:22.725 --> 02:25.603
My wife had a baby son.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.939
Hey! That’s great, Sipowicz.
Congratulations.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.234
Thanks. Yeah, seven pounds,
three ounces. (CHUCKLES)

02:31.943 --> 02:34.028
He’s got his mom’s looks. No disrespect.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.865
Hey, right now you could kick me
in the shins, I wouldn’t take offense.

02:37.073 --> 02:38.116
(CHUCKLES)

02:38.825 --> 02:40.451
So, what got taken?

02:40.618 --> 02:43.454
DOA’s purse was tossed,
rings and earrings are missing.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.165
-Nothing else.
-Who’s she live with?

02:45.331 --> 02:49.878
Um... The husband, Andrew Moss,
and the DOA's 12-year-old kid, Eddie.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.045
He’s at school.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.422
-Thanks.
-Right.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.048
-Hey, Andy.
-Hey.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.468
-So, boy or girl?
-Boy.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.305
(GROANS) How’s Connie?

03:00.680 --> 03:05.143
Good, and she’s recuperating
from the operation.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.146
But she’ll be home in a couple days.
She’d want you to come by.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.439
Oh, definitely.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.609
All right, but now we got a DOA.
Kids later.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.445
BALDWIN: Place got tossed. (GROANS)

03:15.778 --> 03:18.281
Yeah. Maybe a push-in, maybe not.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.783
I’ll call Junior,
have the husband come in.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.995
-All right.
-Hey. (WHISTLES)

03:25.496 --> 03:27.123
Seven pounds, three ounces.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.335
-BALDWIN: Hey, congratulations, Andy.
-Thanks.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.920
That’s great.

03:32.545 --> 03:33.713

04:58.214 --> 05:00.049
You know, this and that.

05:01.759 --> 05:02.927
Uh, it’s fine.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.514
This is my partner, Rita Ortiz.
Irma Pacheco.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.057
-How you doin’?
-Hey.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.893
-KELLY: So, what brings you?
-I got some information.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.563
-Um, is she cool?
-Of course.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.275
Irma helped me out when
I was working in narcotics in Brooklyn.

05:17.525 --> 05:20.778
-Yeah well, what I got ain’t about drugs.
-Let’s hear it.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.864
Okay so, this guy that I’ve been seeing,

05:23.072 --> 05:25.158
yesterday he told me
he’s got a shipment coming in.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.951
Four dozen nine-millimeter Glocks.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.579
I guess some guy he knows
stole them down in Maryland,

05:29.704 --> 05:31.122
and he’s looking to offload them up here.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.832
A guy you’ve been seeing?

05:33.082 --> 05:36.294
-We’re just partying together, but yeah.
-So, you and Theresa broke up?

05:36.586 --> 05:38.796
Yeah, and I don’t like talking about it.

05:39.255 --> 05:41.841
-What’s this guy’s name?
-Pete Murphy.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.176
He lives on Madison and Clinton.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.178
-And you’re ready to roll on him?
-IRMA: I don’t love the guy,

05:45.428 --> 05:48.181
but, you know,
he’s been taking care of me. That's it.

05:48.598 --> 05:49.932
In exchange for getting him drugs?

05:50.224 --> 05:52.435
I might've put him in touch with people
as far as that goes.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.229
We got a little companionship thing going.
Look, you want the info or not?

05:55.730 --> 05:57.106
We’ll check it out and get back to you.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.901
So, uh, what kind of numbers
are we looking at?

06:00.151 --> 06:03.279
Well, umm, this is obviously
a little bigger

06:03.446 --> 06:04.822
than some guy dealing dime bags.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.991
I’m sure the reward will reflect that.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.243
Enough for you and me to run off together?

06:10.036 --> 06:13.164
Open up that restaurant in Santa Fe?

06:38.564 --> 06:40.024
Thanks, but I don’t need condolences.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.610
What I need to know that everything’s
being done to find who did this.

06:42.693 --> 06:45.405
-That’s absolutely the case.
-Because if it's not, or I feel it's not,

06:45.696 --> 06:47.573
I have a friend
whose brother is a U.S. attorney.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.742
He's very well connected,
I will make that call.

Better it’s kept simple for now, Mr. Moss.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.122
Let’s talk about some things
that have come up with the case.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.958
Mainly, how it’s looking less
like a random robbery.

-She knew who did it?
-ANDY: Please, have a seat.

06:58.751 --> 07:02.171
Your building is pretty secure,
and there’s not much signs of a struggle,

07:02.255 --> 07:05.258
and an expensive wristwatch
was ignored, so maybe.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.385
Can you think of anybody
who she had problems with?

07:07.593 --> 07:08.594
How about her ex-husband?

07:08.970 --> 07:11.180
What was going on between your wife
and her ex-husband?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.641
It was over her son,
who lives with us, Eddie.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.643
Her ex-husband, Ed, always has some issue.

07:16.310 --> 07:19.188
He wants to spend more time with Eddie,
would buy too many things for Eddie.

07:19.355 --> 07:21.607
I mean, stupid stuff. It’s his ego.

07:21.899 --> 07:23.526
Did he ever make threats toward your wife?

07:23.901 --> 07:25.778
I’d have mentioned that, don’t you think?

07:26.529 --> 07:28.322
(SIGHS) I’m not trying
to put on a prick suit here.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.075

07:31.284 --> 07:33.911
-All right, we’ll talk to Ed, uh...
-Pisarchik.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.129
-about you and your wife.
-We were fine.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.797
Can you confirm
where you were this morning,

07:44.922 --> 07:47.758
-after Eddie went to school?
-I’m at work before he leaves.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.469
And your co-workers will confirm that?

07:49.802 --> 07:53.347
-Ed Pisarchik. Did you not hear me?
-We did. We just got to rule you out.

07:53.806 --> 07:54.849
(SIGHS) All right.

and the guard downstairs.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.381
Pete Murphy.
A flag came up when we ran him.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.718
Apparently, the FBI has got Murphy’s dad,
Joe, under surveillance.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.720
We’re going to find out
what that’s all about.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.431

I’m heading down there.

08:35.973 --> 08:37.975

-Hi.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.362
And this is my boss, Sergeant Gibson.
Have a seat.

08:50.154 --> 08:52.323
-So, Pete Murphy?
-Yeah.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.535
-What do you have on him again?
-He told an informant of mine,

08:55.618 --> 08:57.828
he’s bringing four dozen handguns
in from Maryland.

08:57.995 --> 08:59.747
I haven’t heard anything about that
over our wire.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.333
And I’ll be honest with you,
that doesn’t sound like Pete.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.252
-'Cause it's not his game?
-It’s out of his league.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.212
-He's strictly pissant.
-Why do you have Pete’s dad up?

09:06.420 --> 09:08.130
CHARLIE: We like him for a series
of jewelry heists.

09:08.506 --> 09:11.133
-So, who’s this informant of yours?
-A Hispanic girl.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.053
She was a CI of mine in narcotics.
She has never steered me wrong.

09:14.262 --> 09:17.640
-Puerto Rican girl. Named Irma?
-Yeah, why?

09:17.723 --> 09:20.309
We intercepted a cellphone call
between Pete and his dad.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.270
Joe was asking Pete
who the Puerto Rican chick was,

09:22.353 --> 09:23.896
Pete was talking to in a car.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.566
Pete said it was this chick
named Irma, who he banged.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.901
And apparently, the girl was
having trouble taking the hint.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.152
Basically, stalking him.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.072
Okay, but like I said,
she’s never steered me wrong.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.699
But she’s a snitch, so...

09:35.366 --> 09:37.326
don’t be surprised
if she fell off the wagon here.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.620
Maybe Pete was lying to his dad
about the relationship.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.455
Maybe.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.249
We’ll look into it some more
and get back to you.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.711
Listen, Pete’s dad is a real bad guy.
He came out of the Westies.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.671
He’s beat us on a couple
of homicides that we know of,

09:48.796 --> 09:51.841
so we’re... we're really trying
to squeeze him on this jewelry job.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.051
So please don’t screw this up, huh?

09:54.594 --> 09:55.886
You mean, like we were planning on?

09:56.887 --> 09:58.055
Thanks for coming in, Charlie.

-I’ll wait to hear from you.

you had toward your ex-wife.

-Cutting to the chase, yeah.

would want to take Eddie

11:29.772 --> 11:32.692
away on my weekends sometimes.
Bahamas, skiing,

11:32.775 --> 11:34.026
but then she wouldn’t make up for it.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.529
What about in terms
of her buying Eddie things?

11:36.696 --> 11:39.240
-Did you think she was spoiling him?
-Okay, this is coming from Moss, right?

11:39.365 --> 11:40.866
Leslie's husband,
he couldn’t be more wrong.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.993
But you got to admit,
there’s logic to it, Ed.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.371
-I mean, you’re a working-class guy.
-And proud of it.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.081
But your son’s in a different environment,

11:47.415 --> 11:48.958
-beyond your means.
-No, no.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.460
I was thrilled to see Eddie
getting things he wanted.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.880
-Yeah, things you couldn’t afford.
-I knew when he came to my place

11:54.964 --> 11:56.799
on my weekends, it wasn’t about stuff.

11:57.383 --> 12:00.177
It was about us, our friendship,
him needing his dad.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.347
See Moss is a guy who’s
got to buy people with fancy things.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.600
-I got actual character.
-So, no love lost between you and Moss?

12:07.017 --> 12:09.061
-I mean, he stole my girl.
-How?

12:09.645 --> 12:10.896
She was his secretary.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.524
She’s a fireman’s daughter
from West Islip.

12:13.649 --> 12:17.528
She saw a fancy car, expensive watch,
nice clothes. It bowled her over.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.114
-How were things between them?
-I didn’t ask.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.408
It hurt too much to think about it.

12:23.075 --> 12:26.495
I didn’t want her dead.
I loved her. I wanted her back.

12:26.954 --> 12:28.998
Where were you this morning, Ed?
Seven a.m.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.000
-A union meeting.
-Anyone confirm it?

12:32.251 --> 12:33.419
I saw Luis Alvarez.

12:33.836 --> 12:37.006
Give us the number of Alvarez,
then go home to your son.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.218
You’ve got a beef with Pete Murphy,
and you’re sending us out

12:41.343 --> 12:43.512
-to try and get back at him...
-What I gave you is solid.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.389
Then why did Pete tell his dad
you were stalking him?

12:45.514 --> 12:48.225
'Cause Pete don’t want his dad to know
he’s hanging out with me, doing drugs!

12:48.642 --> 12:51.479
Then why haven’t the feds heard anything
about this gun deal over their wires?

12:51.729 --> 12:54.273
Because Pete lined this up
on the side on his own!

12:54.356 --> 12:56.150
His dad doesn’t think that Pete
knows what he’s doing,

12:56.233 --> 12:58.110
so Pete’s just trying to prove
that he does. You know, feel free

12:58.194 --> 13:00.112
to jump in here, Kelly,
or are you hanging me out?

13:00.196 --> 13:02.573
We’re just double-checking
that this is on the up and up.

13:02.698 --> 13:05.034
-Have I ever burned you before?
-No, you haven’t.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.994
Does a shipment of guns coming
from out of state not interest you?

13:07.244 --> 13:08.412
It absolutely does.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.997
Okay then, so how
about a little more respect

13:10.080 --> 13:11.540
or I will walk right the hell out of here.

13:11.749 --> 13:14.335
Just as long as we’re clear,
'cause there’s a lot riding on this.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.545
Rita. We’re good.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.757
So, when are you
supposed to see Pete next?

13:20.007 --> 13:21.967
He just paged me, "420,"
which means that he wants

13:22.051 --> 13:24.470
to get high at this apartment
he keeps over on Broome.

13:24.678 --> 13:27.306
Okay, we’ll double-check
with our boss and the feds,

13:27.389 --> 13:29.183
and if they sign off,
we’ll get you wired up.

13:33.771 --> 13:34.939

13:37.650 --> 13:40.236

who knows?

13:43.030 --> 13:46.325
You know, normally,
this wouldn’t be any of my business,

13:46.408 --> 13:48.244
but since I’m working the case...

13:48.369 --> 13:49.745
Is there something
you want to ask me, Rita?

13:49.954 --> 13:51.497
I’m just making sure
your relationship with her

13:51.580 --> 13:53.749
is appropriate
and you’re thinking straight.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.963
I’m taking this to the boss
and I'm recommending that we go forward.

being a part of it,

14:01.090 --> 14:02.216
feel free to voice that.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.385
You’re telling me she’s legit?

14:05.803 --> 14:07.263
All right, she’s legit.

-I’m all right. What’s up?

Hey, Jen, it’s me.
Just... just checking in.

Nothing important. Call me when you can.

14:49.680 --> 14:53.767
Uh, it's... it's nice, John.
Thanks, I’ll pass it along to Connie.

-I love the name Matthew.
-He’ll be going by Matt.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.235
The jury came back.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.742
-Your dad was acquitted.
-What does that mean?

15:10.034 --> 15:11.285
They found him not guilty.

15:13.871 --> 15:16.040
Why? Why would they do that?

15:17.833 --> 15:18.959
I don’t know, Michael.

15:19.668 --> 15:23.047
But unfortunately, he’s not the first guy
to beat a murder conviction.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.840
Well, can’t they try and do it again?

15:25.007 --> 15:27.426
There’s a thing in the legal system
called "double jeopardy."

15:28.177 --> 15:30.763
It means, a person can’t be tried
for the same murder twice.

15:31.388 --> 15:34.934
-So, then what? He’s out of jail?
-Yeah.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.023
I don’t want you worrying.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.361
Did I screw up when they asked me
those questions in court?

15:45.527 --> 15:46.612
No.

15:47.029 --> 15:51.283
But that lawyer guy, when he hit me up
about when I lied for my friend at school,

15:51.492 --> 15:52.660
did that make me look bad?

15:53.243 --> 15:56.205
Michael, there’s a hundred
different reasons

15:56.372 --> 15:57.873
why the jury found your dad not guilty.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.584
-Do I have to go back with him?
-Absolutely not.

16:01.085 --> 16:04.046
(SIGHS) But if he’s back on the streets
after what I did.

16:04.421 --> 16:07.132
Going against him in court,
he might come after me.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.551
Put that out of your mind.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.722
I’ll get it legally set up
where he can’t even come near you.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.850
So as far as we’re concerned,
your dad might as well still be in jail.

16:18.268 --> 16:19.937
-Okay.
-Nothing’s changing.

We just keep living our lives
exactly how we have been.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.776
Want to get you back to school?

16:26.902 --> 16:28.195
-Yeah.
-All right.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.326
Another time, I faced scrutiny
under false pretenses,

16:34.451 --> 16:37.329
I was accused of destroying
my neighbor’s flowerpots,

16:37.413 --> 16:38.789
-which was not true.
-JOHN: Mr. Condell,

16:38.914 --> 16:41.709
if you’re not answering a question,
you need to be quiet.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.336
-Okay.
-Do you know Leslie Moss?

16:44.628 --> 16:47.339
No, sir, but I did know a man
named Moss Bacher,

16:47.423 --> 16:49.925
-who taught theology.
-ANDY: If you don’t know Leslie Moss,

16:50.259 --> 16:51.677
how’d you get ahold of her credit card?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.971
-I explained, I found the card.
-In a bush?

16:54.513 --> 16:57.141
Put there by a man with black hair
and a black jacket and black shoes.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.727
But one card was expired,
so I ditched that one.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.478
Where were you this morning
at seven o'clock, Stu?

17:02.479 --> 17:05.149
I call it "yo-yoing."
I board the four train at Spring Street,

17:05.232 --> 17:07.192
and ride to its conclusion in Woodlawn,

17:07.276 --> 17:10.738
then stay on the four train
as it reverses back down to Utica Avenue.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.990
Can anyone confirm
that you were yo-yoing this morning?

17:13.407 --> 17:16.410
-Other commuters and straphangers.
-But no one you’re acquainted with?

17:16.660 --> 17:18.954
Not by name, but one guy
had a hat I’d seen before.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.457
Did you get off the train at all?
Maybe near Greene and Broome?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.292
No, I only got off once,
but not near there.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.794
-The point is to ride.
-ANDY: Did you go into a building

17:26.086 --> 17:28.297
on Greene and Broome
and talk to Leslie Moss?

17:28.797 --> 17:31.383
No, I didn’t get off the train there.
The point is to ride.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.303
Did you have a conversation
with Leslie Moss,

17:34.928 --> 17:37.514
and you talked strange
like you’re doing now,

17:37.639 --> 17:40.517
and she misinterpreted, she got afraid,
and you did something

17:40.601 --> 17:43.687
-that you didn’t mean to?
-No, I said I found the cards.

17:43.979 --> 17:46.899
Stu, did you hurt Leslie Moss
and rob her?

17:47.149 --> 17:50.152
No, I... I got off the four train
a... at the 59th Street Station

17:50.402 --> 17:52.154
at 6:40 this morning.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.907
To defecate at the Delicious Doughnuts
on Lexington Avenue,

17:54.990 --> 17:58.160
and then I re-boarded the four train
15... 15 minutes later.

17:58.285 --> 18:01.872
-Did anyone see you at the doughnut shop?
-Maybe. Probably.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.832

let’s talk about this guy

acting like he didn’t want to be noticed,

about the insensitivity
of the penal system.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.200
I talked to Leonard Nilack today
because I had some questions.

22:07.617 --> 22:10.495
Costs involved,
division of assets, alimony?

22:10.746 --> 22:12.873
-Those kind of questions?
-I didn’t kill Leslie. I was at work.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.624
-No one saw you.
-My assistant!

22:14.791 --> 22:16.877
-She got in at eight.
-This is insane!

22:17.002 --> 22:19.171
Hey, listen, you got a pattern
of nailing secretaries

22:19.463 --> 22:23.091
and bailing when they wear on you,
but this one, you married.

22:23.383 --> 22:25.802
And kicking her to the curb
wasn’t going to come cheap.

22:26.053 --> 22:29.139
All right look, things between Leslie
and me weren’t great.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.725
She was a lot lower rent
than she let on when we were dating.

22:32.267 --> 22:36.063
When that became evident, yeah,
I wandered but I was at work this morning.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.023
Can’t find anyone to confirm that.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.233
-Try harder!
-Mr. Moss, you sit down.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.235
You’re not leaving
until this is sorted out.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.823
Your son, Pete, is in a world
of trouble right now, Joe.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.576
-What the hell’s going on with Pete?
-We know you talked to him.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.620
We know he told you what he’s mixed-up in.

22:51.828 --> 22:52.954
How do you know that?

22:53.288 --> 22:55.374
The girl he’s with, she’s wearing a wire.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.293
Look, we’re not after you,
but if you give a damn about your son,

22:58.585 --> 23:02.172
you will get a hold of him right now,
and you will tell him to turn himself in.

23:02.631 --> 23:05.342
I don’t help cops out.
It’s just a personal rule of mine.

23:07.094 --> 23:10.764
Right now, Pete’s looking at gun charges,
which is going to involve him doing time.

23:11.139 --> 23:12.391
But if he does anything to that girl,

23:12.474 --> 23:14.393
he’ll never see
the outside of a penitentiary.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.020
I don’t believe what cops say either.
Rule number two.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.398
Your son is out there right now.
You can call him.

23:19.481 --> 23:22.025
You can stop this. I know you can.
Help him!

23:26.738 --> 23:27.781
(SIGHS)

23:31.576 --> 23:32.702
Voicemail.

23:33.286 --> 23:34.955
-Where is he?
-I don’t know!

23:35.080 --> 23:36.915
You think I’m happy he’s out there
doing all this crap?

23:37.249 --> 23:39.626
Look, this is on Pete, not on me!
He’s on his own.

23:39.876 --> 23:43.004
If anything happens to that girl,
I’m making sure you do time.

23:45.882 --> 23:49.678
Look, I got an auto-body shop
out in Queens. It’s out of business.

23:53.723 --> 23:56.351
(SIGHS) Try not to hurt him, okay?

24:03.733 --> 24:06.236
PETE: You did this to yourself, bitch!
This is your fault!

24:07.779 --> 24:11.366
Drop the gun, Pete!
You kill her, we kill you.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.826
Do you understand that?

24:13.201 --> 24:15.495
As it stands now,
you’re only looking at a few years,

24:15.579 --> 24:18.206
but you got to put that
gun down right now.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.960
-Don’t throw your life away.
-Don’t act like you give a damn about me!

24:22.085 --> 24:23.462
RITA: We talked to your dad, Pete.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.630
He wanted us to tell you
to turn yourself in.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.549
That’s a lie!

24:27.632 --> 24:29.426
RITA: Who do you think told us
where you were?

24:30.051 --> 24:32.679
He doesn’t want you in prison
the rest of your life.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.641
Put the gun down.
We’ll get your dad on the phone, okay?

24:36.850 --> 24:37.934
He wants to talk to you.

24:40.145 --> 24:43.940
-How many years am I looking at so far?
-A couple, at the most.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.697
(PANTS)

24:59.789 --> 25:00.957
You’re okay.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.047
He cut my face. How bad is my face?

25:07.214 --> 25:08.965
-You’re going to be okay.
-I'm scarred now.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.550
-I’m scarred now, right?
-No.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.219
(WHIMPERS) Theresa’s never
going to take me back.

25:12.385 --> 25:13.845
-(CRIES)
-Hey!

25:14.179 --> 25:16.306
It’s going to heal. Don’t worry.

25:17.265 --> 25:19.601
-Am I still pretty?
-Yeah.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.645
Say it. I want to hear it.

25:22.521 --> 25:26.316
You’re still pretty, Irma. You are always
going to be pretty. You know that.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.735
-Come here.
-(CRIES)

25:34.699 --> 25:36.743
First off, Eddie,
I’m real sorry about your mom.

25:36.910 --> 25:37.911
EDDIE: Thanks.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.413
ANDY: And I know you’d rather be alone
with your dad right now,

25:40.622 --> 25:42.457
but it’s real important
I ask you some questions.

25:42.624 --> 25:43.875
Are you okay with that?

25:44.417 --> 25:47.128
Can you tell me a little
about your stepdad, Andrew?

25:47.212 --> 25:50.173
-Is he nice to you? You get along?
-I guess.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.217
Was he nice to your mom?

25:53.510 --> 25:54.594
Yeah.

25:55.011 --> 25:56.680
Why’d you have to think about it, kiddo?

25:57.764 --> 25:59.349
Andrew wasn’t around much.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.476
-ANDY: Where was he?
-Work.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.937
When he was around,
how did him and your mom get along?

26:04.271 --> 26:07.148
Like... people who are mad at each other.

26:07.482 --> 26:09.901
-Like yelling?
-Or real quiet.

26:11.152 --> 26:13.863
-Did Andrew ever hit your mom?
-I wouldn’t have let him do that.

26:14.197 --> 26:16.366
-Did you ever see her bruised up?
-No.

26:16.992 --> 26:20.328
And they were always like this...
either quiet or yelling?

26:21.079 --> 26:24.874
Andrew was always just wanting to work,
and she would try to get him not to.

26:25.458 --> 26:26.501
How?

26:26.585 --> 26:29.921
She’d try to make him dinners
or go on trips together,

26:30.005 --> 26:31.548
but he’d just talk on the phone.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.134
(PAGER RINGING)
-Eddie...

26:35.760 --> 26:37.929
did you see your stepdad this morning
before you went to school?

26:41.141 --> 26:42.225
ED: Kiddo?

26:42.684 --> 26:45.478
-I’m not feeling so good.
-All right, just tell me if you saw

26:45.562 --> 26:46.938
your stepdad this morning,
then we’re done.

26:47.939 --> 26:52.277
(SIGHS) I don’t know.
Um, can I go lie down?

26:53.612 --> 26:56.448
Been real brave, Eddie.
And again, I’m real sorry about your mom.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.574
Thanks.

27:02.412 --> 27:05.165
-(CELLPHONE RINGING)
-Yeah?

27:16.885 --> 27:19.846
He’s pretty lit, got into it
with one of the regular barflies.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.973
-Clark started it?
-Apparently, but folks inside

27:22.057 --> 27:23.391
say the barfly’s a hothead.

27:23.516 --> 27:25.435
-Anyone hurt?
-He bloodied the guy’s lip.

27:25.685 --> 27:26.770
The guy going to press charges?

27:26.853 --> 27:29.981
Nah, he’s concerned we not collar him
for the weed pipe we found in his pocket.

27:30.398 --> 27:32.984
This owner’s more pissed off
because a table got broken.

27:33.568 --> 27:34.819
All right, tell him this guy’s a cop.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.613
His girlfriend committed
suicide this morning.

27:36.696 --> 27:38.865
-Maybe he can let it slide, huh?
-All right, I’ll talk to him.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.159
-And I’ll pay for the table.
-All right.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.247
Come on, I’ll get you home.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.500
Take a walk.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.044
-What, to another bar?
-Maybe.

27:51.294 --> 27:54.673
Next one, you’ll get locked up.
John, come on, let me take you home.

27:54.839 --> 27:57.592
-Get some coffee, talk about it.
-I’m taking a walk.

27:57.759 --> 27:59.969
-Come on.
-Don’t! Leave me alone.

28:15.276 --> 28:16.736
(SIGHS) Oh, boy.

28:17.612 --> 28:21.157
Hey, Medavoy, do me a favor.
Call Ed Pisarchik.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.326
Tell him you need to speak to him
down here alone.

28:23.576 --> 28:26.162
His sister’s with him right now,
so she can take care of his son.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.957
Detective Jones,
It’s the principal at Michael’s school.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.918
-GREG: What's going on?
-I want to talk to his son again,

28:32.085 --> 28:34.671
but this time, alone.
I’ll head down to their apartment

28:34.754 --> 28:36.381
as soon as Pisarchik comes up here.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.174
EDDIE: Why do you want to talk
to the son again?

28:38.550 --> 28:41.386
-Something’s just not setting right here.
-With the dad or the kid?

28:41.511 --> 28:42.971
I’ll let you know as soon as I find out.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.432
...To answer a few follow-up questions?

28:46.266 --> 28:47.350
Yeah, it shouldn’t take long.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.102
Thanks.

28:49.602 --> 28:51.438
-He’s on his way in.
-Thanks.

28:52.188 --> 28:53.690
Michael’s dad went by his school
looking for him.

28:54.023 --> 28:55.108
You going down there?

28:55.316 --> 28:57.235
-I’m going to find Craig.
-I’ll come with you.

28:57.569 --> 28:58.570
No, I got it.

29:08.663 --> 29:10.165
Take a few bites, okay?

29:11.875 --> 29:14.461
-Sure you’re all right?
-It’s just some follow-up from before.

29:14.961 --> 29:16.004
I’m okay.

29:16.087 --> 29:18.631
-If you need me, I’m in the kitchen.
-Thanks, Aunt Barbara.

29:21.593 --> 29:24.345
So Eddie, when we investigate crimes,

29:24.596 --> 29:27.307
we talk to the victim’s family,
like you, and their friends as well.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.768
-To get whatever information we can.
-Right.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.145
So doing that, we’ve been talking
to your mom’s friends,

29:32.437 --> 29:34.731
and one of them said that
your mom was concerned

29:34.814 --> 29:38.276
because she did something
to make your dad upset recently.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.779
-Do you know anything about that?
-No.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.489
Why don’t you ask my dad?

29:42.864 --> 29:44.449
I will when I see him again.

29:44.866 --> 29:47.577
But for now, do you know
why he was upset with her?

29:48.203 --> 29:50.705
Was your mom planning another trip
with you and your stepdad?

29:51.122 --> 29:52.332
-No.
-Had she asked

29:52.624 --> 29:54.375
if you could stay with her
and Andrew on a holiday

29:54.709 --> 29:57.337
-you normally spend with your dad?
-I don’t know.

29:57.837 --> 30:01.841
Those are things that I’ve been told
generally get him mad.

30:02.842 --> 30:05.553
Is there any other thing
that she’d do to upset him?

30:05.929 --> 30:06.971
I don’t know.

30:07.388 --> 30:10.141
Eddie, are you worried that
I’m asking questions about your dad?

30:10.517 --> 30:12.143
-A little.
-Believe me, I don’t want to,

30:12.936 --> 30:14.979
but this came up,
and it’s got to be put away.

30:15.980 --> 30:19.442
-Look, my dad wouldn’t hurt my mom, okay?
-And that’s what I want to prove.

30:19.734 --> 30:21.528
But until this is answered for,

30:22.195 --> 30:24.656
-someone may always think that.
-(SIGHS)

30:26.074 --> 30:29.244
She didn’t do anything to make him mad.
I did.

30:30.912 --> 30:31.996
What did you do?

30:32.622 --> 30:34.749
My mom would make me
Call Andrew "Dad."

30:35.291 --> 30:39.128
And two weeks ago,
I said it in front of my real dad,

30:39.838 --> 30:42.841
-and he didn’t like it.
-Did he yell at your mom?

30:42.966 --> 30:45.718
I know he called her
because I heard her on the phone with him.

30:46.344 --> 30:50.139
And afterwards she told me never to call
Andrew that in front of my real dad again.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.267
And that’s the only time that happened?

30:53.226 --> 30:56.354
Yesterday, my real dad
found a birthday card

30:56.729 --> 31:00.108
that I was going to give to Andrew,
and in it, I called him dad.

31:00.650 --> 31:03.528
But my real dad didn’t even
get upset about it that time.

31:04.195 --> 31:05.405
Maybe he got used to it.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.323
-I think so.
-All right.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.450
I hope I don’t have to bother you again.

31:15.665 --> 31:16.666
(SIGHS)

31:25.717 --> 31:27.927
-Right on time.
-Let’s go talk.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.847
-I’m having me a cold beer.
-Let’s go.

31:31.806 --> 31:34.767
Remember, how you came in that one day,
shaking your ass.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.145
Telling me how I’d never have
a cold beer again

31:37.270 --> 31:39.272
’cause I was going to jail
for the rest of my life?

31:40.315 --> 31:43.443
-Funny how things work out, huh?
-Let’s go right now.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.280

Congratulations on beating that murder rap
but let’s get something straight.

31:58.124 --> 32:00.835
-Michael doesn’t want to see you again.
-I want to hear it from him.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.462
Oh, you’ll read all about it
when you get served

32:02.545 --> 32:05.048
with that order of protection,
which is being drawn up right now.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.592
You come within 90 feet of Michael again,

32:07.675 --> 32:09.719
your parole is violated
and you go back in.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.138
Yeah, well, we’ll see what my lawyer
has to say about that.

32:12.555 --> 32:14.474
Because I’m bringing paperwork
against you, chief.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.477
When my guy heard
about how you adopted my son,

32:17.810 --> 32:20.146
turned him against me,
had him testify against me,

32:20.813 --> 32:22.315
you should have seen his jaw
hit the floor.

32:23.399 --> 32:25.276
Michael’s going to have an order
of protection against you

32:25.360 --> 32:28.112
by the end of the day.
That’s the reality of the situation.

32:28.529 --> 32:31.199

don’t you?

All talk, but when it comes down to it,
your knees start knocking.

about that order of protection.

but this morning,
I was in a union meeting.

-so he couldn’t be certain of that.
-Well, I am.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.276
Ed, you’re a decent guy.
You love your kid.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.446
I want to make this painless as possible,
but you got to be honest.

33:51.738 --> 33:53.781
Make what painless?
What are you talking about?

33:53.990 --> 33:56.284
Ed, did you find a birthday card yesterday

33:56.409 --> 33:59.620
from your son To Andrew Moss,
where your son called him "dad"?

33:59.954 --> 34:02.498
-No.
-Yeah, you did and two weeks ago,

34:03.041 --> 34:05.084
you heard your son call him dad.

34:05.334 --> 34:07.420
Did you go see your ex-wife
about it this morning?

34:07.712 --> 34:09.338
Did you talk to Eddie
without me being there,

34:09.505 --> 34:11.174
when I specifically said
that wasn’t to happen?

34:11.466 --> 34:13.426
Ed, what I meant
by making this painless

34:13.509 --> 34:14.635
was keeping your son out of it.

34:14.969 --> 34:17.764
But if you keep lying or fixate
on irrelevant things,

34:17.847 --> 34:20.683
-he will have to be involved.
-What are you threatening here?

34:20.933 --> 34:23.019
Do you want to put him through a trial

34:23.227 --> 34:25.354
and see him forced
to take the stand against you?

34:25.438 --> 34:26.856
Do you know what that’ll do to your son?

34:27.148 --> 34:30.068
Now, tell me about the birthday card,
and he’ll never see a courtroom.

34:30.651 --> 34:34.238
Was this about your son
calling Moss dad?

34:35.448 --> 34:36.616
Is that what happened?

34:38.242 --> 34:39.577
-Answer me!
-Yes!

34:40.745 --> 34:42.080
I’m his dad!

34:43.039 --> 34:46.751
I told her she couldn’t do that!
I wouldn’t allow it.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.545
It was the only request I made to her.

34:49.879 --> 34:52.298
Not allowing your ex-wife
to make Eddie call him dad?

34:52.423 --> 34:53.424
Would you?

34:54.801 --> 34:56.010
She took my dignity.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.430
She took my boy out of my house.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.100
I would not let her replace me.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.853
She insisted that Eddie call him that.
She thought it would stoke Moss’ ego

35:05.978 --> 35:10.233
and keep him from divorcing her.
She was an evil, evil woman.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.360
Did you go to her place
this morning to talk about it?

35:13.069 --> 35:14.487
There was nothing to talk about.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.114
The first time it happened, I told her,

35:16.280 --> 35:19.575
"Don’t put our son in the middle
Of your marital problems.

35:20.409 --> 35:23.621
"Don’t take the only thing in my life
that makes it worth living.

35:27.041 --> 35:30.711
"Look, Leslie... please."

35:34.549 --> 35:35.591
She told me to grow up.

35:36.884 --> 35:37.969
What did you hit her with?

35:40.138 --> 35:41.597
Eddie’s baseball bat.

35:41.848 --> 35:43.474
(SOBS) Oh, God.

35:43.766 --> 35:44.976
Oh, God.

35:46.602 --> 35:48.437
ANDY: I’m going to help you
with your statement.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.231
I’m so sorry I did it.

35:51.399 --> 35:54.402
(CRIES) I just didn’t want to lose my son.

36:02.743 --> 36:05.580
Pete Murphy’s with the feds right now,
giving a first statement.

36:05.872 --> 36:08.416
-On the gun deal, too?
-Yeah, everything but his dad.

36:08.541 --> 36:10.501
He wouldn’t flip,
or he doesn’t know anything?

36:10.585 --> 36:12.879
Both, maybe. They’re going
to keep working him, though.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.299
-How’s your informant?
-Getting stitched up at Bellevue.

36:17.884 --> 36:21.095
-What happened to your lip?
-A little scuffle. No big deal.

36:29.729 --> 36:32.273
-He go for it?
-Yeah. Hank’s getting his statement.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.358
-Any word from Clark?
-No, I’m sorry.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.819
-Do you want me to stay in case he calls?
-No, go ahead.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.906
(CLEARS THROAT) Anybody going
to be around here for a little bit?

36:40.281 --> 36:41.324
Yeah, I am.

36:41.407 --> 36:43.409
Can you make sure that this guy
gets to central booking?

36:43.701 --> 36:45.828
I got to go check on Connie
at the hospital.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.623
-Give her our best.
-ANDY: Yeah, I’ll do that.

36:49.790 --> 36:50.833
Hey, Baldwin.

37:00.801 --> 37:01.928
How’d you get the lip?

37:02.720 --> 37:05.598
-A little misunderstanding.
-Did you go after Michael’s dad?

37:06.098 --> 37:07.892
I went to talk to him.
He threw the first punch.

37:08.267 --> 37:11.062
-Just hauled off and hit a cop?
-I may have baited him a little.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.939
Then you threw the second, third,
and fourth punch?

37:13.022 --> 37:14.106
Something like that.

37:14.523 --> 37:17.109
This is the kind of guy who would go
to the job with a whole different version.

37:17.193 --> 37:19.612
-Yeah well, I got mine.
-Where’s your head at, Baldwin?

37:19.695 --> 37:21.697
This guy just won’t go away.
I’ve given him every opportunity.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.032
-Where’s your head at?
-I’m fine.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.744
I’m fine. (SIGHS)

37:27.995 --> 37:29.914
But when I get face-to-face with him,

37:31.374 --> 37:32.833
when he starts pushing my buttons,

37:32.917 --> 37:35.378
when I know he won’t let Michael
live his life,

37:36.212 --> 37:37.338
I admit...

37:39.173 --> 37:40.299
I want to kill him.

37:41.217 --> 37:43.928
You do something like that,
even if you get away with it,

37:44.095 --> 37:45.304
you’re going to spend
the rest of your life

37:45.388 --> 37:46.555
looking over your shoulder.

37:51.852 --> 37:54.063
Maybe it wouldn’t be a bad idea if, uh...

37:54.814 --> 37:56.649
if you kept tabs on the situation...

37:59.110 --> 38:00.987
-and kept tabs on me.
-I will.

38:01.862 --> 38:03.114
Get the order of protection together,

38:03.197 --> 38:04.824
and don’t make contact
with this guy again.

38:05.241 --> 38:06.409
All right.

38:06.492 --> 38:07.952
But first, get someone
to take a photo of you

38:08.327 --> 38:11.330
before that swelling goes down.
And go to Gibson.

38:11.455 --> 38:14.333
Tell him what happened, and write it up,
but ask him to sit on it.

38:15.376 --> 38:16.460
All right.

38:17.670 --> 38:18.796
Thanks.

38:19.547 --> 38:23.175
Regardless of what this guy has done,
you’re standing between him and his son.

38:23.509 --> 38:24.802
You got to remember that.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.352
So, uh, when your brother
comes home, you know,

38:33.561 --> 38:35.313
it’s going to be busy here for a while.

38:35.896 --> 38:40.192
And I don’t want you feeling left out,
’cause we’re going to need you involved.

38:40.901 --> 38:41.986
-Okay.
-Yeah.

38:42.778 --> 38:48.993
Like, you know, going on walks with him
or getting his bottles ready.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.121
You’re going to be a very special person
in his life.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.332
Yeah?

38:55.541 --> 38:57.418
You’re going to be his big brother,

38:58.044 --> 39:00.963
and that means that
you got to teach him the ropes,

39:01.589 --> 39:03.549
like when he starts walking and talking.

39:03.883 --> 39:06.552
And I want you to be the first one
to show him how to throw a baseball,

39:06.635 --> 39:08.012
’cause you got a natural motion.

39:08.554 --> 39:10.014
-I do?
-Oh, yeah.

39:10.973 --> 39:13.601
And you know, maybe he’ll be getting
more attention at first,

39:13.726 --> 39:15.394
but that’s just to get him
started out right,

39:15.519 --> 39:16.812
which we want you to be a part of.

39:17.229 --> 39:18.272
Okay.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.149
-Dad?
-Yeah?

39:20.524 --> 39:22.610
Will you still read to me
before I go to bed?

39:23.027 --> 39:25.071
-You bet.
-You don’t have to.

39:25.237 --> 39:29.033
Hey, sport, just ’cause there’s a new baby
doesn’t mean your stuff goes away.

39:29.325 --> 39:31.827
Everyone in this family
is equally special.

39:32.286 --> 39:33.829
That’s what makes it a family,

39:34.372 --> 39:36.957
and there’s nothing in the world
more important than that.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.626
-You got it?
-Got it.

39:39.293 --> 39:40.795
-All right.
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

39:47.843 --> 39:49.929
Uh, why don’t you go in
and get ready for bed?

39:50.012 --> 39:51.764
-I’ll be right in.
-THEO: Okay.

39:58.729 --> 39:59.855
-Hey.
-Hey.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.858
-Come in.
-I’m... I'm just staying for a second.

40:04.318 --> 40:06.529
Oh, it looks... it looks nice.

40:07.363 --> 40:08.531
Connie will be happy.

40:10.157 --> 40:11.283
Come on in, sit down.

40:11.659 --> 40:15.663
No, no, I’m just... uh,
I’m just here to say,

40:15.913 --> 40:17.832
uh, I just, you know,

40:17.998 --> 40:20.793
I’m here to say I’m sorry
for this afternoon.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.838
It’s no problem, John.
Why don’t you sit down?

40:24.880 --> 40:25.923
No.

40:26.298 --> 40:30.177
I... I can’t stop moving, or I...

40:30.594 --> 40:32.555
I think too much, I get messed up.

40:34.932 --> 40:38.060
So... I just want to say sorry.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.189
I wish I could have been there
to stop her.

40:43.649 --> 40:45.443
You couldn’t hold her hand every minute.

40:45.651 --> 40:47.653
I know. I just wish.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.740
-I got to go. I got to walk.
-I want you to stay.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.702
No, you got enough to deal with, Andy,

40:55.578 --> 40:57.079
with the, um, babies.

40:59.623 --> 41:01.333
(SOBS) I can’t burden you.

41:02.877 --> 41:05.713
You’re no burden, John. You’re family.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.758
I got to walk. I got to go.

41:10.217 --> 41:12.344
I can’t let you leave
if you’re going to go drinking more.

41:12.428 --> 41:14.889
I haven’t been drinking.
I just... I just got to keep moving.

41:16.515 --> 41:17.516
I’ll call.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.269
Anytime.

41:45.461 --> 41:46.587
Okay, sport.

-We were right here.
