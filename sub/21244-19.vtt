-Hey, Byron.
-Hey, KC.

00:07.290 --> 00:09.380
I'm at this thing
my dad dragged me to,

00:09.380 --> 00:11.620
but I'll be free
in time for our movie.

00:11.620 --> 00:16.880
I can't go tonight
because my grandma is not well.

00:16.880 --> 00:20.120
I am so sorry.
Go take care of your grandma.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.710
I hope she feels better.

00:21.710 --> 00:23.330
Thanks, Byron.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.460
Wow, Dad, that was amazing!

00:27.460 --> 00:30.250
I'm so glad that we came.

00:31.540 --> 00:34.420
KC? What are you
doing here?

00:36.290 --> 00:40.500
KC, I thought you said
you were with your sick grandma.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.540
And since when were you part
of a university drumline?

00:42.540 --> 00:44.330
You're not even
in college yet!

00:44.330 --> 00:47.170
Uhh... I...

00:47.170 --> 00:50.420
[imitates KC] I'm not leaving
until I get an answer, KC.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.790
I see. See what's
happening here.

00:54.790 --> 00:56.250
-Mm.
-[chuckles]

00:56.250 --> 00:57.460
You thought I was KC.

00:57.460 --> 01:00.460
I'm not. I'm
her cousin Cassandra.

01:00.460 --> 01:01.880
Her cousin?

01:01.880 --> 01:03.830
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, no,
we're first cousins.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.920
We look exactly alike.
It's weird, I know,

01:05.920 --> 01:09.210
but, um, I'm actually
a tiny bit cuter, so...

01:09.210 --> 01:12.380
Are you messing with me?
'Cause I'm feeling messed with.

01:12.380 --> 01:14.540
-Mm...
-Look, KC, if you're
not interested

01:14.540 --> 01:17.120
in going out with me,
I wish you would just say so.

01:17.120 --> 01:20.000
Again, I'm Cassandra.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.420
So this is more
of a KC conversation.

01:23.420 --> 01:25.460
But I know she's
with her grandma,

01:25.460 --> 01:26.920
so she's probably home
by now.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.920
All right,
you want to play this out?

01:29.920 --> 01:31.880
I'll play this out, KC!

01:32.880 --> 01:35.380
Or... possibly Cassandra.

Okay, I have a cousin
named Cassandra who looks
exactly like me,

and I was visiting
my sick grandma,
so just go with it, okay?

02:50.080 --> 02:52.880
-Sick grandma on my side

-Dad's!

Byron, hi!
Is KC expecting you?

03:05.920 --> 03:07.500
Oh, why,
because she's not home?

03:07.500 --> 03:08.920
She's not home, is she?

03:10.750 --> 03:12.290
Yeah, she's upstairs.

03:12.290 --> 03:14.080
She's still a little upset
about her grandma.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.710
I mean, I don't know
if she mentioned this,

03:15.710 --> 03:17.380
but she's not doing
very well.

03:17.380 --> 03:19.620
Not my mama, 'cause she's
healthy as a horse.

03:19.620 --> 03:22.170

only eats at restaurants

So, she's really here?

03:26.620 --> 03:29.080
-Mm-hmm.
-Because I'd like to see her.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.960
-KC!
-Hey, Byron, what's up?

03:34.380 --> 03:36.500
Give me your arm.

03:36.500 --> 03:40.420

for the third date

slightly perspiring.

03:45.710 --> 03:47.500
Why exactly is that, KC?

03:47.500 --> 03:50.540
Did you just run home
for some reason?

03:50.540 --> 03:54.620
Mm, no. I was upstairs
doing squats, okay?

03:54.620 --> 03:57.080
You don't think this
just happens, do ya?

03:59.120 --> 04:02.290
KC, look me in the eye
and tell me

04:02.290 --> 04:04.620
that I didn't just see you
at American University

04:04.620 --> 04:06.120
in a drumline outfit.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.460
Oh... drumline.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.540
-He ran into Cassandra.
-[both chuckle]

04:13.540 --> 04:15.710
No, my cousin goes there.
She's on the drumline.

04:15.710 --> 04:16.790
See, I don't
believe you!

04:16.790 --> 04:18.880
Boy, I know you're not
coming in my house,

04:18.880 --> 04:21.210
raising your voice
and calling my baby a liar!

04:21.210 --> 04:22.540
-What's wrong with you!
-Uh...

04:22.540 --> 04:25.330
Mom, Mom, I think I got
this one, thank you.

04:28.710 --> 04:32.120
Whoo. Okay, KC,
I'm just gonna say it.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.040
Something's up with you.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.710
What are you hiding?
Because I know you're
lying to my face.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.920
I'm not lying to you.
I told you, I have
a cousin named Cassandra,

04:39.920 --> 04:42.380
she goes to American University,
and she's on the drumline.

04:42.380 --> 04:44.540
If you don't believe me,
we could all go
to dinner tomorrow.

04:44.540 --> 04:45.540
-Fine.
-Fine.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.380
-You better not cancel.
-I won't.

04:47.380 --> 04:49.670
-Looking forward to it.
-Me too.

04:49.670 --> 04:50.790
[scoffs]

04:55.710 --> 04:56.790
He seems nice.

05:01.580 --> 05:05.250
-Ugh!
-Worst mission ever!

05:05.250 --> 05:08.000
The food was terrible,
it was too hot,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.620
and on the plane ride back,
I was all crammed!

05:10.620 --> 05:12.500
-There was plenty of room!
-For you!

05:12.500 --> 05:13.670
You lifted
up the armrest

05:13.670 --> 05:15.330
and took one
and a half seats!

05:15.330 --> 05:17.880
Oh... You know,
all you've done

05:17.880 --> 05:20.000
on this entire mission
is complain.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.830
You didn't like the food.
You didn't like the hotel room.

05:22.830 --> 05:24.460
You didn't like the way
that guy threw

05:24.460 --> 05:26.620
that car door at your head
when you weren't looking.

05:26.620 --> 05:27.960
Okay, I give you that one.

05:29.420 --> 05:30.750
I'm just saying,

05:30.750 --> 05:33.290
if we're gonna risk our lives
doing dangerous missions,

05:33.290 --> 05:35.170
we may as well
be comfortable doing it.

05:35.170 --> 05:37.830
But it's not just on missions,
it's at home, too!

05:37.830 --> 05:39.620
"Dad, my WiFi's too slow."

05:39.620 --> 05:41.790
"Dad, we don't have
enough cable channels."

05:41.790 --> 05:43.790
"Dad, my turkey tetrazzini's
too spicy!"

05:43.790 --> 05:46.620
You know I have
sensitive taste buds!

05:46.620 --> 05:50.210
Seriously, son,
you need to toughen up!

05:50.210 --> 05:53.620
Okay, I'll just add that
to your growing list
of personal critiques.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.210
"Ernie, toughen up!"

05:55.210 --> 05:57.290
"Ernie, don't play
so many video games!"

05:57.290 --> 05:59.210
"Ernie, don't be scared
of flatworms!"

06:01.000 --> 06:02.750
You're scared
of flatworms?

06:02.750 --> 06:05.330
If you cut them in half,
they grow into two worms!

06:05.330 --> 06:06.710
It freaks me out!

06:06.710 --> 06:08.120
[groans] Oh, what...

06:08.120 --> 06:11.040
Okay, know what?
Enough is enough.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.250
You have had it
too good for too long.

06:13.250 --> 06:15.880
You're my son
and I love you,

06:15.880 --> 06:17.500
but I have to do
what I think is right,

06:17.500 --> 06:18.880
and what I
think you need

06:18.880 --> 06:20.460
is a little lesson
in tough living.

06:20.460 --> 06:21.960
So I'm kicking you
out of the house.

06:23.670 --> 06:24.710
Oh, come on, Dad!

06:24.710 --> 06:26.710
Oh, no, no! I mean it.
Give me your keys.

06:26.710 --> 06:30.880
For the next 24 hours,
you'll be living
in the backyard.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.040
Fine, just let me
get my phone.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.620
And my laptop.
And my tablet.

06:35.620 --> 06:36.880
And my air mattress.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.290
No problem!
Would you like

06:38.290 --> 06:39.920
a wake-up call
and room service, too?

06:39.920 --> 06:42.750
-Ooh, that would be nice!
-Get outta here!

06:45.580 --> 06:49.330
So, I only see two problems
with this whole dinner date
with Cassandra thing.

06:49.330 --> 06:53.080
Um, the first being
there's no Cassandra,

06:53.080 --> 06:58.830
and the second being...
there's no Cassandra.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.120
But there will be, okay?

07:03.120 --> 07:05.170
Marisa, I'm a spy.
I've disguised myself

07:05.170 --> 07:07.000
as, like, a thousand
different people.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.330
I'm pretty sure I can
dress myself as myself.

07:10.880 --> 07:14.620
All I'm gonna do
is use what we call
a quick-change outfit.

07:14.620 --> 07:17.500
Mm-kay? We use them
all the time when we
go undercover.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.120
Right now you see KC...

07:20.120 --> 07:24.210
now you see Cassandra.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.040
[gasps in amazement] Wow!

07:26.040 --> 07:29.620
Now you can wear
two outfits I hate
at the same time!

07:31.580 --> 07:33.380
But you can't be
in two places at once.

07:34.460 --> 07:35.880
I know, I know.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.750
Marisa, I need
to come up with something,

07:37.750 --> 07:39.620
'cause Byron knows
that something's up,

07:39.620 --> 07:40.750
and I cannot
blow my cover.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.790
Well, it's too bad
you don't have

07:42.790 --> 07:45.330
a secret twin
locked in your basement.

07:45.330 --> 07:48.750
Marisa, I don't say
this often enough,

07:48.750 --> 07:50.420
but you are a genius.

07:50.420 --> 07:52.750
Oh, well, I hate to brag,

07:52.750 --> 07:56.790
but I was just accepted
into community college!

07:56.790 --> 07:58.790
[laughs]

07:58.790 --> 08:01.710
Well, I was waitlisted,
but it's looking good.

08:05.290 --> 08:06.880
I don't know, Agent Cooper.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.830
Releasing a dangerous,
high-profile criminal

08:09.830 --> 08:11.790
is extremely irregular.

08:11.790 --> 08:13.790
Yeah, well, you have
my ID and the paperwork,

08:13.790 --> 08:15.670
so what more
do you need?

08:15.670 --> 08:17.040
No one said anything
to me, though.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.080
I think I need to double check
with Agent Johnson.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.080
Okay, sure, I've got
nowhere else to be.

08:21.080 --> 08:25.250
Go ahead, check
with Agent Johnson...
during his lunch.

08:25.250 --> 08:29.460
You know, bother him
about something
he's already approved.

08:29.460 --> 08:32.670
I guess I won't see you
at the Christmas karaoke party.

08:32.670 --> 08:34.000
Fa-la-la-later.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.710
Oh, hold on!

08:35.710 --> 08:37.790
I love that karaoke party.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.790
I'm supposed to sing
"We Are Family"

08:40.790 --> 08:42.500
with the boys
from Accounting.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.420
Besides, Johnson
signed the paperwork.

08:44.420 --> 08:45.580
Bring out the prisoner.

08:51.710 --> 08:53.710
Hello, Bernice.

08:53.710 --> 08:55.250
'Sup, ugly?

09:02.380 --> 09:04.920
Well! Never thought
I'd see your face again.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.540
[chuckles]
Don't you see it

09:06.540 --> 09:08.170
every time you look
in the mirror?

09:08.170 --> 09:10.040
I'm in maximum security,
Cooper.

09:10.040 --> 09:13.880
The only mirror I have
is the stainless steel toilet
in my room.

09:16.460 --> 09:18.920
Which is perfect, because
every time I see my reflection,

09:18.920 --> 09:20.620
I need something
to barf in, anyway!

09:22.880 --> 09:27.670
Well, I see solitary confinement
hasn't dulled your wit.

09:29.330 --> 09:32.170
So, what do you want
from me, Beanpole?

09:32.170 --> 09:34.330
I'm about to tell you,
Snotnose.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.580
Look, I need your help
with something.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.920
Ha! Help you.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.170
I wouldn't spit on you
if you were on fire.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.080
Unless...

09:49.080 --> 09:53.210
Okay. I'm sorry, but you
are in no position
to negotiate.

09:53.210 --> 09:55.920
Fine, then take me back
to my toilet mirror!

09:55.920 --> 09:57.920
Um, on the other hand,

09:57.920 --> 10:00.420
[scoffs] what's
a little favor

10:00.420 --> 10:03.000
amongst two friends
who hate each other's guts?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.290
[cheerless laugh]
What do you want?

10:05.290 --> 10:08.960
[sighs] I want a new face.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.670
Any face. I don't care
if you give me

10:11.670 --> 10:14.500
three noses and one eye,
or a beak with feathers.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.960
I just can't stand looking
at this ugly mug anymore.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.120
Fine. You got it.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.500
I also want smaller feet.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.330
Okay, eh, eh.
Get in line, sister.

10:23.330 --> 10:25.120
Okay, if they
had that procedure...

10:25.120 --> 10:26.960
I would've done it already.

10:31.750 --> 10:34.750
Oh, baby, this is good!

10:34.750 --> 10:36.920
Thank you!
I ordered it myself.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.210
[Ernie wailing]

10:43.960 --> 10:45.920
Are you sure about
this lesson, Craig?

10:45.920 --> 10:48.710
I mean, Ernie sounds
so sad and hungry.

10:48.710 --> 10:51.670
Nonsense. That's just the sound
of him getting tougher!

10:53.170 --> 10:56.080
Yeah, but there's no place
for the poor kid to sit down

10:56.080 --> 10:58.210
because you moved all
the furniture in the garage!

10:58.210 --> 11:01.080
That's not true.
I had the gardener move it.

11:02.460 --> 11:06.540
Besides, he can use
Nature's chair-- the dirt.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.540
It just feels cruel.

11:08.540 --> 11:11.210
Sweetie, I know
what I'm doing, okay?

11:11.210 --> 11:14.120
Any minute now, he's gonna start
gathering materials

11:14.120 --> 11:16.170
and build himself
a shelter, watch.

11:16.170 --> 11:18.420
Well, what about food?
I mean, the kid needs food.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.960
[sighs]

11:20.960 --> 11:23.500
He's eating
my plants, Craig!

11:23.500 --> 11:25.500
The boy's
eating my plants!

11:27.920 --> 11:30.170
Can't we toss him
an apple or something?

11:30.170 --> 11:32.580
See, that's the problem!
You coddle him!

11:32.580 --> 11:34.960
Well, I'm sorry,
but he's my child,

11:34.960 --> 11:37.000
and I don't want
to watch him suffer!

11:38.170 --> 11:40.210
Know what? You're right.

11:40.210 --> 11:42.000
Thank you!

11:43.620 --> 11:45.380
I don't want to watch
him suffer, either!

11:46.830 --> 11:47.920
Problem solved!

11:49.580 --> 11:51.420
Craig Cooper, open that door

11:51.420 --> 11:53.290
and let our son
back in this house now!

11:53.290 --> 11:55.580
-No!
-I said let him back in!

11:55.580 --> 11:56.830
And I said no.

11:56.830 --> 11:59.000
I'm warning you, Craig.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.580
[laughs] Oh, really?
What are you gonna do?

12:02.580 --> 12:04.210
Can we at least talk about--?

12:04.210 --> 12:05.750
[bolt clicks]

12:05.750 --> 12:08.000
[laughs]

12:08.000 --> 12:10.620
That's right.
That's right.

12:10.620 --> 12:14.880
I'm here to make sure
you take no shortcuts
on the path to toughness.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.040
-Mom kicked you out.
-Yeah.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.620
Get your own dinner!

12:27.460 --> 12:29.460
-[beep, zap]
-Yow, what was that?

12:29.460 --> 12:31.080
A tracking device.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.460
If you thought that you were
gonna escape on my watch,

12:33.460 --> 12:35.710
heh, think again!

12:35.710 --> 12:40.170
Hmm, well, you may
be able to track me,
but you can't catch me.

12:41.250 --> 12:44.000
-[beeps]
-Aaah!

12:45.750 --> 12:47.540
What the heck was that?

12:47.540 --> 12:50.830
Hmm. Anytime you want
to try something,

12:50.830 --> 12:52.620
I just press
this little button

12:52.620 --> 12:54.290
and 300 volts
of electricity

12:54.290 --> 12:57.080
will go through
your body, yeah.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.420
Excuse me, did I
forget to mention that?

13:00.420 --> 13:02.210
Well, on second thought,

13:02.210 --> 13:04.460
I have no place to be
except for prison,

13:04.460 --> 13:07.750
so go ahead--
you were saying?

13:07.750 --> 13:10.880
Look, here's
the deal, okay?

13:10.880 --> 13:12.250
We're going
to dinner tonight,

13:12.250 --> 13:14.500
and I need you to pretend
to be my cousin Cassandra.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.830
She goes to American University,
she's a drummer,

13:16.830 --> 13:19.620
and she's sweet, kind,
and respectful.

13:19.620 --> 13:22.500
Hmm! So she's
a real snooze-fest like you.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.920
Listen, Cassandra
doesn't get all mouthy,

13:25.920 --> 13:27.120
okay, or she gets the--

13:27.120 --> 13:30.250
Aah-- okay!

13:30.250 --> 13:32.960
I see your point!

13:32.960 --> 13:36.170
Now, listen,
we only have a few hours

13:36.170 --> 13:38.000
before I need to get you
back to prison

13:38.000 --> 13:40.580
before the guard changes,
so listen carefully.

13:40.580 --> 13:44.120
-When you're pretending
to be Cassandra...
-Uh... excuse me.

13:45.960 --> 13:49.210
Cassandra?
Shouldn't I be you?

13:49.210 --> 13:52.210
Me? No, Byron
already knows me.

13:52.210 --> 13:54.080
He's not gonna think
that you're me.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.540
Oh, really? So this boy

13:55.540 --> 13:57.620
knows you better
than your entire family.

13:57.620 --> 14:01.290
Hm, well, I remember
fooling them for two weeks.

14:01.290 --> 14:03.580
In fact,
I think the phrase

14:03.580 --> 14:05.540
"You're more likeable
than ever"

14:05.540 --> 14:07.960
was uttered on more
than one occasion.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.330
-[zap]
-[groans]

14:09.330 --> 14:11.500
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm in charge.

14:11.500 --> 14:14.580
I'm in charge, okay,
so you're Cassandra.

14:14.580 --> 14:15.790
KC.

14:15.790 --> 14:17.210
Cassandra.

14:17.210 --> 14:19.080
-KC. KC!
-Cassandra. Cassandra!

14:19.080 --> 14:20.170
-KC!
-Cassandra!

14:20.170 --> 14:24.210
-[zaps]
-Aaah! [sighs]

14:24.210 --> 14:26.290
You know what?
I just decided on my own

14:26.290 --> 14:27.960
that I'd like
to be Cassandra.

14:32.540 --> 14:35.000
Listen, you better be
on your best behavior,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.420
or I swear, no new face,
and I will--

14:37.420 --> 14:39.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
zap, zap, zap.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.420
Whatever. Let's just
get this over with, Cassandra.

14:42.420 --> 14:45.000
[sighs] Okay,
for the last time,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.420
you're Cassandra,
I'm KC.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.750
Fine. We'll do it your way.

14:49.750 --> 14:52.290
Thank you! Ohh!

14:52.290 --> 14:53.790
[beeping]

14:53.790 --> 14:56.830
[whimpers]

14:56.830 --> 14:58.500
Hi, Byron!

14:58.500 --> 15:02.250
Remember my cousin Cassandra
who you thought didn't exist?

15:02.250 --> 15:04.790
Well, Cousin Cassandra,
who does exist,

15:04.790 --> 15:07.420
meet Byron.

15:07.420 --> 15:10.210
Byron, nice
to meet you again.

15:11.210 --> 15:14.830
I don't know
what to say.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.290
Well, you can start
by saying hi.

15:18.580 --> 15:21.040
Sorry. Hi.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.460
KC, I feel like a jerk.

15:23.460 --> 15:25.710
I-I thought you made
this whole thing up,

15:25.710 --> 15:27.710
and yet, here she is!

15:28.670 --> 15:31.000
Here I am!

15:31.000 --> 15:32.460
I'm sorry
I called you a liar.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.250
Oh, that's fine.

15:35.460 --> 15:38.330
I'm not really that great
of a person, anyway.

15:40.210 --> 15:41.920
In fact, the more
you get to know me,

15:41.920 --> 15:43.420
the less you'll like me!

15:44.710 --> 15:46.330
-[beep, zap]
-[groans] Oh...!

15:46.330 --> 15:48.000
I mean, uh...

15:49.250 --> 15:50.790
Apology accepted.

15:56.250 --> 15:59.250
I just can't
get over it!

15:59.250 --> 16:01.460
It's like you're
the same person!

16:02.580 --> 16:04.880
Heh. Not quite.
[cheerless laugh]

16:04.880 --> 16:09.830
We are two very, very,
very different people.

16:11.750 --> 16:13.380
I think he got
your point

16:13.380 --> 16:15.420
after the third
or fourth "very."

16:16.830 --> 16:19.620
Really, it's quite easy
to tell us apart.

16:19.620 --> 16:21.580
I'm the one that thinks
life is all about

16:21.580 --> 16:23.710
getting good grades
and playing by the rules.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.420
Mm! [chuckles]

16:25.420 --> 16:28.290
Well, I'm the one who thinks
I can just do whatever I want

16:28.290 --> 16:31.080
and there's no consequences
for my actions!

16:31.080 --> 16:32.290
I'm boring.

16:32.290 --> 16:34.290
I'm obnoxious.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.670
I'm friendless,

16:36.670 --> 16:38.290
and often have bad gas

16:38.290 --> 16:39.460
and blame it
on other people.

16:39.460 --> 16:41.250
Mm...

16:43.330 --> 16:45.540
[cheerless chuckles]

16:45.540 --> 16:49.920
Well, I only have so much
patience with people
before I zap them...

16:49.920 --> 16:53.540
-Wait--
-...with a zinger.

16:53.540 --> 16:55.330
[laughing]

16:55.330 --> 16:58.120
Yup. Yup.
Just kidding!

16:58.120 --> 16:59.620
We love each other.

16:59.620 --> 17:01.290
Aw.

17:01.290 --> 17:02.790
Cousin hug?

17:02.790 --> 17:04.830
Yeah!

17:04.830 --> 17:05.960
Love you, cuz!

17:05.960 --> 17:07.420
[evil laugh]

17:07.420 --> 17:09.120
[chuckles]

17:10.540 --> 17:12.500
Aw, that's so nice!

17:12.500 --> 17:14.830
I'm actually really close
with my family, too,

17:14.830 --> 17:17.540
which is something I guess
we have in common.

17:17.540 --> 17:19.500
[chuckles] I need
to go to the bathroom.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.750
Oh. Well, then,
I'll just go with you.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.920
Uh, that won't
be necessary.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.830
Can do it on my own.
Been doing it for a while now.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.000
But we always go
together, remember?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.250
Not this time.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.040
I need to do this
on my own,

17:34.040 --> 17:35.290
if you know what I mean.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.960
Uh, yeah, I do know
what you mean,

17:41.960 --> 17:43.620
which is why
I'm going with you.

17:43.620 --> 17:45.620
Uh, Cassandra, chill.

17:45.620 --> 17:47.580
Let her go
to the bathroom by herself.

17:47.580 --> 17:49.960
I mean, it's not like
she's an escaped convict
or something!

17:49.960 --> 17:51.540
No, haha!

17:51.540 --> 17:55.580
Fine, yeah, go ahead.
Just, uh, make smart choices.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.750
I don't think she has
much of a choice.

18:00.750 --> 18:03.380
You know, usually
once you get inside there,

18:03.380 --> 18:05.580
whatever happens,
happens, you know?

18:05.580 --> 18:07.420
[laughs cheerlessly]

18:07.420 --> 18:09.210
Yeah, so how'd
you two meet?

18:09.210 --> 18:11.500
Uh, actually,
we're both honor students,

18:11.500 --> 18:14.750
-and we, uh...
-[beep, zap]
-[Bernice screams]

18:14.750 --> 18:17.500
Uh, maybe you actually
should go check on KC.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.830
Mm, no, I think she's fine.

18:19.830 --> 18:24.170
[beeps]

18:24.170 --> 18:26.500
Mm-hmm, on second thought,
it never hurts to check.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.250
[beeping]

18:32.250 --> 18:33.790
You're not going anywhere!

18:41.210 --> 18:43.500
[fight grunts]

18:46.460 --> 18:47.710
Whoa!

19:04.250 --> 19:06.880
[pressured water
hissing]

19:29.120 --> 19:31.120
Cassandra, are you okay?

19:31.120 --> 19:33.120
Yeah, yeah,
no, I'm good.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.670
I'm good, just uh...

19:35.670 --> 19:37.670
turned the faucet up
a little high, and, uh...

19:37.670 --> 19:39.040
sprayed me a little.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.040
A little?

19:41.040 --> 19:42.920
It looks like you didn't
make it to the stall.

19:44.540 --> 19:45.880
Where's KC?

19:45.880 --> 19:49.670
Uh, she had to leave
unexpectedly, or...

19:49.670 --> 19:52.080
not so unexpectedly.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.120
I can't believe
she blew me off again.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.620
No, she didn't blow you off.
She told me to tell you that--

19:56.620 --> 19:58.620
You know what?
I don't care.

19:58.620 --> 20:00.750
Just tell her I said
I know she's hiding something.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.540
What? No, I just
told you. She's--

20:02.540 --> 20:04.540
You know what? Really,
I don't even care what it is.

20:04.540 --> 20:06.920
I'm over her, and you can
tell her that I said so.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.710
Uh! Okay!

20:08.710 --> 20:11.500
Fine! My cousin
don't want you, anyway!

20:13.040 --> 20:15.500
Oh, man, this was
definitely not worth

20:15.500 --> 20:16.960
breaking a maniac
out of prison.

20:21.540 --> 20:25.330
Oh, sitting on this ground
is starting to make
my back hurt.

20:25.330 --> 20:29.670
Are you sure it's not just
the pain of toughening up?

20:29.670 --> 20:31.620
This is all your fault.

20:31.620 --> 20:34.460
If you weren't so spoiled,
I wouldn't have had
to teach you a lesson.

20:34.460 --> 20:37.920
Yeah, because it's
always the child's fault
that he's spoiled.

20:37.920 --> 20:40.670
The parent has
nothing to do with it.

20:40.670 --> 20:44.040
And exactly what lesson
have I learned?

20:44.040 --> 20:47.250
That plants and gravel
do not a meal make?

20:48.710 --> 20:50.580
One more word
out of you, and--

20:50.580 --> 20:52.620
What, you're gonna
kick me out of the house?

20:52.620 --> 20:55.920
Because it's generally
the people inside the house

20:55.920 --> 20:58.120
who can kick people
out of it.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.380
You know what?

21:00.380 --> 21:02.120
I've had enough of this.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.620
I will not...

21:04.620 --> 21:06.540
be locked out...

21:06.540 --> 21:07.920
of my own house!

21:10.960 --> 21:12.620
Uhh!

21:14.210 --> 21:15.620
Yes!

21:17.790 --> 21:20.380
You know the spare key is
actually under that rock, right?

21:25.830 --> 21:28.460
Oh. Sorry.

21:28.460 --> 21:30.000
Oh, don't be.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.420
Come here, son.

21:32.790 --> 21:34.960
This is exactly what
I wanted to happen.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.710
See, you're always
so laid back.

21:36.710 --> 21:38.420
I wanted you to be
a man of action.

21:38.420 --> 21:39.580
I send you out
in the world

21:39.580 --> 21:41.750
and I put you in some
dangerous situations,

21:41.750 --> 21:44.170
and I need to know
you can handle yourself.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.540
And clearly you can.

21:47.670 --> 21:49.290
I'm proud of you, boy!

21:49.290 --> 21:50.790
Thanks, Dad!

21:50.790 --> 21:53.290
So, uh, what are we
telling Mom about the door?

21:53.290 --> 21:54.830
Beats me.
That's all you!

21:54.830 --> 21:56.040
Man of action.

21:58.210 --> 22:01.170
[wail] Mom!

22:02.920 --> 22:05.330
Well, Bernice is gone.

22:05.330 --> 22:07.080
I just ran
a facial recognition scan

22:07.080 --> 22:09.040
of all the security footage
in the area,

22:09.040 --> 22:11.500
and the only face I found
was my own!

22:11.500 --> 22:15.790
Apparently, I went
to the Olive Pit with her
and left without her,

22:15.790 --> 22:18.380
which I already knew, so...

22:18.380 --> 22:20.500
Well, you know what,
KC, maybe you should've

22:20.500 --> 22:22.290
put some sort
of tracker on her.

22:22.290 --> 22:25.580
Oh, really, Marisa!
Wow, why didn't I think of that?

22:25.580 --> 22:28.460
I have been the best friend
of a spy for some time now,

22:28.460 --> 22:30.420
so I've learned
a few tricks of the trade.

22:33.170 --> 22:37.000
Marisa, it's not helping, okay?
Seriously, look.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.670
Bernice is dangerous, okay,
and it's all my fault

22:39.670 --> 22:41.670
because I'm the one
who let her out,

22:41.670 --> 22:43.620
and I don't know
what to do!

22:43.620 --> 22:45.670
You should've never
broken her out of prison.

22:45.670 --> 22:48.420
What you should've done is put
me in one of those KC disguises

22:48.420 --> 22:50.830
like I wore when I had to cover
for you at the Organization.

22:52.750 --> 22:55.420
Marisa, I do not say
this often enough,

22:55.420 --> 22:57.380
but you are a genius!

22:57.380 --> 22:58.790
Yay!

22:58.790 --> 23:03.790
No! I don't wanna go to jail!

23:03.790 --> 23:06.170
Good job, Marisa, you're
coming off really believable!

23:07.750 --> 23:10.080
No! No, no, no!
I'm not kidding!

23:10.080 --> 23:12.710
I-I-I changed my mind!
I don't wanna be you!

23:12.710 --> 23:14.580
I don't wanna go to jail!

23:14.580 --> 23:16.500
Marisa... Uh, mm!

23:16.500 --> 23:18.040
Excuse me, Officer,

23:18.040 --> 23:20.790
could you help me
with this prisoner?

23:20.790 --> 23:22.750
Don't make me
tase you, Bernice!

23:22.750 --> 23:25.120
[Marisa sobbing]

23:27.330 --> 23:30.880
No! I thought you
were my friend!

23:33.250 --> 23:34.750
[woman]
Rob, your name's on TV!
