WEBVTT

00:00.841 --> 00:02.808
I could?

00:03.326 --> 00:05.861
Yeah, ok. Yeah.

00:05.929 --> 00:07.429
2:30 is actually
better for me,

00:07.497 --> 00:08.430
so, yeah, ok.

00:08.498 --> 00:09.698
That's a personal call,
is it?

00:09.766 --> 00:12.301
Uh, can I call you back?
Thanks. Bye.

00:12.368 --> 00:15.404
How's the job hunt going?
It's a little tougher than you thought, is it, or...

00:15.471 --> 00:18.173
All right, well, carry on.
Keep up the good work.

00:19.876 --> 00:22.344
What?

00:25.949 --> 00:29.551
All I was trying to say
in there was, you know,

00:29.619 --> 00:30.986
I want him on the street
getting a life,

00:31.054 --> 00:32.753
not in there
getting a latte.

00:32.822 --> 00:34.556
Why don't you just
tell him that, then?

00:34.624 --> 00:36.391
And spoil all the fun?

00:36.459 --> 00:38.360
Do me a favor.

00:39.629 --> 00:42.064
Show me it.

00:42.131 --> 00:43.498
Uh-oh.

00:44.567 --> 00:46.568
This is Juan Ramirez,

00:46.636 --> 00:48.470
street name Prince John,
of the Nine-Six clique.

00:48.538 --> 00:51.073
Push in tighter.

00:52.575 --> 00:56.144
That's, uh, Detective, uh...

00:56.212 --> 00:57.913
What's his name again?

00:57.981 --> 01:00.249
Farr.

01:00.316 --> 01:02.017
Murderous hatred.

01:02.085 --> 01:03.685
What happens next?

01:10.426 --> 01:15.230
So what part of you
is thinking "I told you so"?

01:18.268 --> 01:19.601
Internal Affairs.

01:19.669 --> 01:21.937
They've been watching
Wallowski for a while.

01:22.005 --> 01:25.374
Apparently it's not uncommon
to run surveillance
on gang unit cops.

01:25.441 --> 01:27.042
You got this from I.A.?

01:27.110 --> 01:28.810
They came to me with it,
because of your relationship
with Wallowski,

01:28.878 --> 01:31.513
which somehow
they know about.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.451
All right, look at her.

01:37.654 --> 01:39.554
She's pissed off.

01:39.622 --> 01:41.556
At her partner.

01:42.792 --> 01:44.393
She tried to stop him.

01:44.460 --> 01:46.061
It could be argued
that she did that

01:46.129 --> 01:48.397
once the other cops
arrived on the scene.

01:48.464 --> 01:50.365
It could also be argued
that you thought

01:50.433 --> 01:52.567
having a compromised cop
in your pocket
was a good idea

01:52.635 --> 01:55.337
and there was nothing
I could do or say
to warn you.

01:55.405 --> 01:59.474
This is a message to you
from Internal Affairs.

01:59.542 --> 02:02.744
Your new friend Wallowski
is under the microscope.

02:02.812 --> 02:05.314
And they want me
to stay out of it.

02:06.950 --> 02:09.251
You want me to stay
out of it.

02:17.260 --> 02:19.027
Dr. Lightman.

02:19.095 --> 02:20.529
What do you want?

02:20.596 --> 02:23.365
Every cop in the city
have passed
their fitness test.

02:23.433 --> 02:26.134
Police range.
Police personnel only.

02:26.202 --> 02:28.236
What's Prince John
got on you

02:28.304 --> 02:32.574
that makes you
want to kill him, eh?

02:33.943 --> 02:35.577
Have a nice day.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.021 --> 02:47.990
It's not so much fun
killing cardboard, is it?

02:48.057 --> 02:50.625
Let me guess.
You've seen the video.

02:50.693 --> 02:54.463
Yeah. You want to know
how I got it?

02:56.766 --> 02:59.067
I.A. gave me that tape.

02:59.135 --> 03:01.703
Now, why would they
be watching you,

03:01.771 --> 03:03.972
do you think,
in your humble opinion?

03:04.040 --> 03:07.409
What you saw on that tape
is my partner subduing
a suspect.

03:07.477 --> 03:08.677
Trying to kill him,
more like.

03:08.745 --> 03:10.379
Corner kids
like Prince John,

03:10.446 --> 03:12.347
they keep guns
in the wheel Wells
of nearby cars.

03:12.415 --> 03:14.249
He was going for
a hidden gun.

03:14.317 --> 03:15.851
Oh, so where's the gun
now, then,

03:15.918 --> 03:18.620
in a police evidence
locker somewhere?

03:19.756 --> 03:21.690
You working with I.A. Now?

03:21.758 --> 03:24.092
If I was,
you'd be in the cop shop.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.728
Answer a simple question--
what's going on between
you and your partner?

03:26.796 --> 03:28.663
What are you hiding?

03:39.075 --> 03:43.845
You know, you do that whole
tough guy cop thing really well,

03:43.913 --> 03:46.782
but do me a favor--save it
for the customers, all right?

03:46.849 --> 03:50.419
Look, Prince John,
he's a mid-level dealer
with the Nine-Sixes.

03:50.486 --> 03:53.321
All right. So if there
was a reason to arrest him
yesterday,

03:53.389 --> 03:55.724
what's he doing
on the street today, then?

03:55.792 --> 03:58.393
Herman Farr
is a good man, period.

03:58.461 --> 04:00.796
What your partner did
on that tape

04:00.863 --> 04:03.198
is the beginning of the end
for both of you.

04:03.266 --> 04:04.666
What do you care?
I'm just the cop

04:04.734 --> 04:07.969
that you like to squeeze
on the street,
in the sack, wherever.

04:08.037 --> 04:10.505
In the sack?

04:10.573 --> 04:13.041
That's a bit previous,
isn't it?

04:14.977 --> 04:18.447
That beating was personal.

04:18.514 --> 04:20.781
Prince John has something
on your partner,

04:20.850 --> 04:23.018
and you know exactly
what it is.

04:23.086 --> 04:24.553
Which makes you a target
as well.

04:24.620 --> 04:27.355
I can take care
of myself,

04:27.423 --> 04:29.558
thank you.

04:32.228 --> 04:34.396
Give us a go, then.

04:41.571 --> 04:46.108
You know,
you do need my help.

04:46.175 --> 04:49.111
You just don't know
how to ask for it. Do you?

04:53.216 --> 04:54.149
All right.

04:54.217 --> 04:55.283
Hey.

04:55.351 --> 04:57.285
Easy, tiger.

05:00.123 --> 05:01.873
I'll drive.

Vigilante Five-O pigs.

05:52.950 --> 05:54.617
It's Prince John, right?

05:54.685 --> 05:57.086
Do you know
what a prince is

05:57.154 --> 05:58.454
where I come from?

05:58.522 --> 05:59.989
What did you say?

06:00.057 --> 06:01.224
No--well, that as well.

06:01.291 --> 06:02.859
But I wasn't talking about
your sexual preferences.

06:02.926 --> 06:04.794
A prince, where I come from,

06:04.862 --> 06:07.263
is a burden on the taxpayer.

06:07.331 --> 06:08.498
Settle.

06:10.868 --> 06:12.268
She's been practicing.

06:12.336 --> 06:14.403
Beat it, snow?

06:14.471 --> 06:17.607
What's she gonna find on you
if she pats you down, eh?

06:17.674 --> 06:18.941
Seriously.

06:19.009 --> 06:21.377
What's she gonna plant
on him, you mean?

06:21.445 --> 06:25.348
Eight ball with your name on it
in this pocket right here.

06:26.784 --> 06:30.720
Ask your question. Go on.

06:30.788 --> 06:32.889
What you got on my partner?

06:35.192 --> 06:36.893
I know he's fat.

06:38.462 --> 06:41.831
You see, I think you can
do better than that, really.

06:41.899 --> 06:43.566
Mm-Hmm.
Don't you, Wallowski?

06:43.634 --> 06:44.967
You know the drill.

06:46.470 --> 06:48.070
I mean, we gotta go.

06:49.072 --> 06:50.640
I'll be back.

06:50.707 --> 06:52.942
You be all right?

06:53.010 --> 06:55.044
Let's go.

07:02.886 --> 07:07.023
That tune-up that
Detective Farr gave you,

07:07.090 --> 07:08.691
was personal, right?

07:08.759 --> 07:12.061
So that means either
you have unfinished business

07:12.129 --> 07:15.097
or Detective Farr's
on the take.

07:15.165 --> 07:19.035
Or, you've got
something he wants.

07:19.102 --> 07:20.803
Tune-up?

07:20.871 --> 07:22.371
Nah.

07:24.575 --> 07:27.343
Well, I got it.

07:27.411 --> 07:29.812
Option 2. Detective Farr's
on the take.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.181
That's not news to you.
What--

07:32.249 --> 07:35.151
you gonna take his word
over a decorated cop?

07:35.219 --> 07:37.520
That was no ordinary beating.

07:37.588 --> 07:40.122
Farr wanted to kill him.

07:40.190 --> 07:42.491
Which is why the Prince here
is on the run.

07:42.559 --> 07:44.861
What, you see me running?

07:46.029 --> 07:48.965
My advice to you...

07:49.032 --> 07:51.467
Dust off your sneakers...

07:51.535 --> 07:53.069
Princess.

07:56.773 --> 07:58.941
We done?

07:59.009 --> 08:01.043
I need a ride home.

08:03.981 --> 08:07.116
Well...Protect and serve.

08:08.619 --> 08:11.921
This is the serve part.

08:11.989 --> 08:15.458
We found that Wallowski
has a number
of interesting reactions.

08:15.525 --> 08:18.127
Pursed lips and puffed cheeks
indicate resignation.

08:18.195 --> 08:20.196
Widened eyes show fear.

08:20.264 --> 08:21.497
Oh, yeah?

08:21.565 --> 08:23.799
We're breaking down the videos
into micro-expressions.

08:23.867 --> 08:26.269
I'll break you down into
micro-expressions in a minute.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.375
Put your hand on your heart
and tell me you think
Wallowski's clean.

08:32.442 --> 08:35.510
What, you mean clean like you?

08:36.580 --> 08:38.514
Give us the room.

08:38.582 --> 08:42.618
Now, look, I didn't mean that
in a bad way.

08:42.686 --> 08:44.520
I know what you meant.

08:44.588 --> 08:47.423
Have a seat.

08:47.491 --> 08:49.191
Now what, nurse?

08:50.127 --> 08:52.495
You came up
on I.A.'s radar

08:52.562 --> 08:53.763
the minute
you and Wallowski

08:53.830 --> 08:55.331
decided to start
seeing each other.

08:55.399 --> 08:56.899
That's a business meeting,
that.

09:03.273 --> 09:05.241
I don't have an ax to grind
against her, Cal,

09:05.309 --> 09:06.309
I really don't.

09:07.778 --> 09:09.245
You just don't trust my judgment
where she's concerned, huh?

09:09.313 --> 09:11.180
I don't want to see you
get hurt.

09:11.248 --> 09:13.282
Yeah.

09:13.350 --> 09:14.717
Right.

09:16.353 --> 09:17.987
It's a little late
for that now.

09:18.055 --> 09:19.288
For what?

09:19.356 --> 09:22.892
I'm up to my neck in it.
Come on.

09:36.707 --> 09:39.241
Prince John.
I dropped him off an hour ago.

09:40.811 --> 09:44.814
Dr. Foster?
Can I have a word?

09:56.393 --> 09:57.893
This isn't happening.

09:57.961 --> 09:59.028
Did he do this?

09:59.096 --> 10:00.763
He didn't say.

10:00.831 --> 10:02.498
Does he know
who did this?

10:02.566 --> 10:06.202
If he did, we wouldn't
be standing here
talking about it.

10:06.269 --> 10:07.470
Did you ask him?

10:07.537 --> 10:11.007
He's a city cop 20 years.

10:11.074 --> 10:13.376
You asked him.

10:13.443 --> 10:16.178
Your worst nightmare--
he lied to you.

10:17.581 --> 10:20.016
Incoming.

10:20.851 --> 10:21.951
Detective Wallowski,

10:22.019 --> 10:23.853
Internal Affairs.
Jenkins.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.988
Weapon, please,
Detective.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.860
Or do you want me
to arrest you out here?

10:30.927 --> 10:33.229
Arrest her for what?

10:33.296 --> 10:34.997
That.

10:36.066 --> 10:38.000
On what evidence?

10:48.945 --> 10:51.914
Eyewitness.

10:54.673 --> 10:58.343
So I'm thinking,
I distract the guards,

10:58.410 --> 10:59.811
and you start digging.

10:59.878 --> 11:01.546
You got a spoon on you?

11:04.383 --> 11:08.419
Or you could tell me
the truth about Farr.

11:08.487 --> 11:09.988
I'll get you out
that way.

11:10.055 --> 11:13.458
Look, Farr didn't kill
Prince John.

11:13.525 --> 11:14.926
You and I lifted him,

11:14.994 --> 11:16.327
an hour later
he's back on the street,

11:16.395 --> 11:18.262
and that's why he's dead.

11:18.330 --> 11:21.299
You don't believe that.

11:21.367 --> 11:22.867
So I bit my lip.

11:22.935 --> 11:24.669
Give me a break.

11:24.737 --> 11:28.740
If one of those gang-bangers
thinks you killed Prince John,

11:28.807 --> 11:32.076
this is the worst possible
place you could be, love.

11:36.048 --> 11:39.717
Mind if I speak
with my partner now?

11:42.554 --> 11:44.188
I'll get you that spoon.

11:49.161 --> 11:51.662
What took you so long?

11:51.730 --> 11:53.664
She's never gonna
rat out her partner.

11:53.732 --> 11:56.234
I mean, you can offer
her any deal you like.
It's not going to happen.

11:56.301 --> 11:59.971
Uh-huh. So that's your
science speaking, is it?

12:00.039 --> 12:01.806
You need me.

12:01.874 --> 12:03.408
Badly.

12:03.475 --> 12:06.544
This is a department
investigation, Dr. Lightman.

12:06.612 --> 12:08.713
Do you want to look good
for your career,

12:08.781 --> 12:11.449
or do you want
to get this right
and look even better?

12:13.919 --> 12:15.520
If you are gaming me,

12:15.587 --> 12:17.955
I will flush you
down the toilet.

12:18.023 --> 12:19.857
You and Wallowski.

12:19.925 --> 12:21.325
Bollocks.

12:21.393 --> 12:22.827
You got an innocent cop
sitting in jail

12:22.895 --> 12:24.262
with a target
on her back.

12:24.329 --> 12:25.997
Wallowski's there because
we have an eyewitness murder

12:26.065 --> 12:27.331
with no alibi.

12:28.367 --> 12:29.767
You look me in the eye
and you tell me

12:29.835 --> 12:31.569
you don't have skeletons.

12:31.637 --> 12:34.972
'Cause you know
if I start looking,
I'll find them.

12:36.041 --> 12:37.708
What do you want?

12:37.776 --> 12:39.477
Detective Farr.

12:39.545 --> 12:41.813
But...Not here.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.915
At my place.
My comfort zone,
not yours.

12:43.982 --> 12:47.718
And when you find dirt
on that woman, Wallowski,
which I know there is?

12:47.786 --> 12:49.320
"That woman"?

12:49.388 --> 12:51.289
Is that your science
talking now?

12:51.356 --> 12:54.325
Then you'll give her
to me, too.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.561
Woman, on tape:
I just saw a boy shot,

12:56.628 --> 12:58.696
95th and Chalmers.

12:58.764 --> 13:01.866
White lady cop threw him
out her car,
then started shooting.

13:01.934 --> 13:03.568
Male 911 dispatcher:
And you said an officer
was involved?

13:03.635 --> 13:05.103
Wachowski, Willinski...

13:06.171 --> 13:07.805
Something like that.

13:07.873 --> 13:09.841
Works the gangs up here.

13:09.908 --> 13:12.143
I thought I took
your desk away.

13:12.211 --> 13:14.812
This is the 911 tape
of the eyewitness.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.314
She has an evasive
vocal tic.

13:16.381 --> 13:18.783
The throat clearing--
she did it when
she was making statements

13:18.851 --> 13:20.184
about Detective Wallowski.

13:20.252 --> 13:24.388
Did you come up with this
all by yourself?

13:24.456 --> 13:28.926
And, if you listen
to the tape
in its entirety...

13:28.994 --> 13:31.462
It was definitely
her. I recognized...

13:31.530 --> 13:33.464
She gives unnecessary details.

13:33.532 --> 13:35.399
Not answering questions
directly.

13:35.467 --> 13:37.101
She's lying.

13:37.169 --> 13:39.070
Maybe she's just old.

13:40.038 --> 13:42.807
Look, you keep doing that.

13:42.875 --> 13:45.576
And it just gets
funnier and funnier.

13:45.644 --> 13:48.346
Where'd you get
the 911 tape from, hey?

13:48.413 --> 13:50.515
You're not the only one
with police contacts.

13:50.582 --> 13:51.883
What, Loker?

13:51.950 --> 13:53.651
Afraid so.

13:54.853 --> 13:57.088
Next time, however,
will you run it by me first?

13:57.156 --> 14:00.291
That throat clearing--
it's phlegm--she's a smoker.

14:04.029 --> 14:05.463
African coffee.

14:05.531 --> 14:07.465
Best on the planet.

14:10.302 --> 14:12.904
Is that your son
in there, Mrs. Phillips?

14:12.971 --> 14:14.739
Oh, lord, no.

14:14.806 --> 14:15.806
Grandson.

14:15.874 --> 14:18.276
Louis. He lives with me.

14:18.343 --> 14:20.278
How do you take it?

14:20.345 --> 14:23.481
A splash of milk,
2 sugars. That's me.

14:25.817 --> 14:27.385
Where in Africa?

14:27.452 --> 14:28.819
Kenya.

14:28.887 --> 14:31.222
Mrs. Phillips:
I know a guy
knows a guy...

14:32.324 --> 14:33.591
Second man:
Watch that chopper!

14:33.659 --> 14:35.626
You trying to make
your grandma deaf?

14:35.694 --> 14:37.161
Leave her out of this.

14:40.299 --> 14:41.332
Leave her out of what?

14:41.400 --> 14:43.501
You a cop. I can smell.

14:44.336 --> 14:46.003
How old are you, then?

14:50.909 --> 14:52.410
Nice ink, that.

14:52.477 --> 14:55.313
That's the Nine-Sixes, is it?

14:55.380 --> 14:57.148
You know, the proud, the few.

14:57.216 --> 14:58.549
However it goes.

14:58.617 --> 14:59.917
Comedian cop.

14:59.985 --> 15:03.921
You just play your game.
You don't mind me, all right?

15:06.925 --> 15:09.727
How about over here?

15:10.829 --> 15:12.096
And whoever killed Prince John,

15:12.164 --> 15:14.832
I wouldn't breathe a word
about that if I were you.

15:14.900 --> 15:17.802
I don't know nothin'
about that.

15:19.504 --> 15:22.206
Well, that's smart.
You see, you keep
your mouth shut,

15:22.274 --> 15:23.608
you pick your side
in this war carefully,

15:23.675 --> 15:25.276
'cause you never know,
right?

15:25.344 --> 15:27.111
Next time it could be you,
couldn't it?

15:27.179 --> 15:28.879
Beat it, snow.

15:32.618 --> 15:35.186
Damn.

15:36.455 --> 15:38.089
I'd get that if I were you.

15:41.827 --> 15:44.895
You never leave home
without it, right?

15:44.963 --> 15:47.331
Oh, yeah,
'cause I'm that stupid.

15:47.399 --> 15:49.934
Keep it. I'm straight.

15:52.104 --> 15:54.205
Snow. I'm beginning
to like that.

15:54.273 --> 15:56.040
It's growing on me.
Very creative, that.

15:56.108 --> 15:57.575
I'm going over to Ronnie's
house, grandma.

15:57.643 --> 16:00.778
Be home for dinner.
It's your favorite.

16:05.150 --> 16:07.985
Ronnie's house, my ass.

16:08.053 --> 16:10.221
Here. Merry Christmas.

16:11.490 --> 16:13.591
It's a firing pin.

16:14.726 --> 16:17.328
Just so long
as he comes home is all.

16:17.396 --> 16:19.297
Yeah.

16:21.133 --> 16:22.500
What was I saying?

16:22.567 --> 16:25.136
The shooting. Prince John.

16:25.203 --> 16:27.672
Yes. I'm 110% certain

16:27.739 --> 16:30.007
it was the Wallowski
girl who shot him.

16:30.075 --> 16:32.977
I might be old,
but I'm not blind.

16:40.752 --> 16:45.089
You know, there's many
different kinds of blindness.

16:45.157 --> 16:46.524
Blind is blind.

16:46.591 --> 16:48.559
Right, yeah.

16:48.627 --> 16:51.662
Well, thanks for your time,
Mrs. Phillips.

16:51.730 --> 16:53.464
That's it?
What about your coffee?

16:53.532 --> 16:55.833
Rain check.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.146
Hi, mate.

17:11.349 --> 17:16.820
Louis, I thought you was
on your way to Ronnie's.

17:16.887 --> 17:18.155
You lost?

17:18.223 --> 17:20.724
Oh, look at you.
Lovely.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.492
Matching ink.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.729
You guys must really,
really like each other.

17:24.796 --> 17:26.329
Or something.

17:26.397 --> 17:29.367
Not that there's
anything wrong
with that.

17:33.472 --> 17:34.505
It's ok.

17:34.573 --> 17:36.507
Good evening, all.

17:36.575 --> 17:38.442
Another day in D.C.,
Professor.

17:38.510 --> 17:40.578
Whew. Blimey.

17:42.147 --> 17:44.248
Well, at least
your partner's
got an alibi this time.

17:44.316 --> 17:46.183
You know, her being
in jail and that.

17:47.686 --> 17:48.686
Who was he?

17:48.754 --> 17:50.955
His street name's Stomper.

17:51.022 --> 17:53.124
Local pharmaceutical rep
for the Nine-Sixes.

17:53.191 --> 17:55.559
Who's that one?

17:56.361 --> 17:58.095
Who's that one?!

17:58.163 --> 17:59.597
Hey?

17:59.664 --> 18:00.898
What's he smiling
about, eh?

18:00.966 --> 18:02.333
He's not smiling.

18:02.401 --> 18:03.267
Come on, calm down.

18:03.335 --> 18:04.835
It's not a capital
offense, you know.

18:04.903 --> 18:07.204
Disperse those clowns.

18:07.272 --> 18:09.640
What, you mean lift 'em,
right?

18:09.708 --> 18:11.475
I mean, they know
the dead guy.

18:11.543 --> 18:14.578
They're all in the same
gang together.

18:20.352 --> 18:21.185
Now, listen.

18:21.253 --> 18:22.920
How you doin', mate?

18:22.988 --> 18:25.222
Who's that one
over there?

18:25.290 --> 18:26.323
Oh.

18:26.391 --> 18:28.659
He's that dangerous, is he?

18:28.727 --> 18:31.996
How does Detective Farr
know him?

18:32.063 --> 18:33.464
Hit me in the stomach.

18:34.466 --> 18:35.666
Back off, man.

18:35.734 --> 18:37.701
Is he one of the ones
grabbing for power?

18:37.769 --> 18:39.236
Is he?

18:39.304 --> 18:42.740
You hit me in the stomach,
I'll pay you $50, with a smile.

18:42.808 --> 18:44.942
Which one's gonna make you
look better?

18:45.010 --> 18:47.077
You're crazy.

18:48.013 --> 18:50.181
Look,
whoever killed Prince John

18:50.248 --> 18:51.982
killed your friend over there.

18:52.050 --> 18:53.517
Right?

18:53.585 --> 18:55.653
Who was it?

18:56.488 --> 18:58.589
Not that lady cop.

18:59.825 --> 19:01.625
Thanks for that.

19:01.693 --> 19:04.929
All right, stomach,
not face, all right?

19:04.996 --> 19:06.230
Ohh!

19:06.298 --> 19:08.632
That's cold.

19:09.701 --> 19:10.868
Did you see that?

19:10.936 --> 19:11.802
You ok?

19:11.870 --> 19:13.637
Oh, no, I'm fine.

19:13.705 --> 19:15.406
Cal.

19:17.008 --> 19:18.609
You tell your I.A. Friend

19:18.677 --> 19:21.946
I want to talk
to that one there.

19:22.013 --> 19:23.414
All right?

19:23.482 --> 19:26.217
This isn't a gang war.
It's more like a gang
at war with itself.

19:26.284 --> 19:28.552
And he knows it.

19:28.620 --> 19:31.922
He's part of it, he is.
He's even picked sides.

19:39.405 --> 19:41.506
Two Nine-Sixes
in two days, Suarez.

19:42.654 --> 19:43.754
Busy man.

19:43.822 --> 19:44.889
First off,

19:44.956 --> 19:46.724
he's not a man,
so try "boy."

19:46.791 --> 19:48.826
See what I mean?

19:48.894 --> 19:50.594
You Call this science?

19:50.662 --> 19:54.365
Well, it sells books,
you know?

19:54.432 --> 19:57.835
Ask him why
he's so happy

19:57.903 --> 20:00.905
his own gang members
are dead.

20:05.744 --> 20:07.077
Speak.

20:07.145 --> 20:10.114
You got nothin' on me.

20:10.182 --> 20:12.917
The lady cop killed
Prince John and set him up.

20:12.984 --> 20:16.420
Why are you lying
about her?

20:18.156 --> 20:20.624
Do you need her
out of the way?

20:23.061 --> 20:27.031
You need her where
she's easier to get to.

20:27.098 --> 20:29.366
Right?

20:29.434 --> 20:32.303
Inside.

20:33.138 --> 20:34.772
I'm with you.

20:34.839 --> 20:38.242
Killing cops
is serious business.

20:40.178 --> 20:41.912
Lawyer.

20:41.980 --> 20:42.880
No need.

20:42.948 --> 20:45.583
You're free to go.
Get out of here.

20:51.890 --> 20:53.857
Hello.

21:03.235 --> 21:04.935
You know him, do you?

21:05.003 --> 21:07.037
I work gangs.
He's in a gang.

21:07.105 --> 21:08.906
You seem exceptionally relieved

21:08.974 --> 21:10.541
to see him walking
out of here a free man.

21:10.609 --> 21:13.310
Let me guess.
He asked for a lawyer.

21:13.378 --> 21:15.045
You've interviewed him,
have you?

21:15.113 --> 21:16.180
A few times, yeah.

21:16.248 --> 21:18.382
Always with Wallowski?

21:18.450 --> 21:19.917
I got one for you.

21:19.985 --> 21:22.620
Did you tell Wallowski
you were on the I.A. payroll

21:22.687 --> 21:23.921
when you started doing her?

21:23.989 --> 21:25.923
And why have you kept me
waiting out here?

21:25.991 --> 21:28.092
No reason.

21:28.159 --> 21:29.426
You can go now.

21:29.494 --> 21:30.894
I want interrogation
tape on him

21:30.962 --> 21:31.895
and Wallowski

21:31.963 --> 21:33.764
and any other Nine-Sixes.

21:33.832 --> 21:35.099
Get out of here.

21:35.166 --> 21:38.435
I would, but I got
work to do.

21:41.673 --> 21:43.874
Let me ask you something.

21:43.942 --> 21:47.111
Is this about catching
corrupt cops for you,

21:47.178 --> 21:48.579
or is this about saving
your friend?

21:48.647 --> 21:51.215
Because I still have
an eyewitness.

21:54.519 --> 21:57.121
So you were 2 blocks away
when you heard the shots.

21:57.188 --> 21:59.323
Is that right?

21:59.391 --> 22:02.493
Why don't you let him
tell us where he was.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.061
I was 2 blocks away.

22:04.129 --> 22:05.796
So in this one,

22:05.864 --> 22:07.631
Farr is controlling
the interrogation.

22:07.699 --> 22:08.766
He's warning
Suarez.

22:08.833 --> 22:09.933
And then the next one.

22:10.001 --> 22:12.703
We put you there.
We got witnesses.

22:12.771 --> 22:14.571
We know J.T.
has a beef with you.

22:14.639 --> 22:17.408
We just want to hear
your side of the story,
that's all.

22:17.475 --> 22:19.343
I need a break.

22:19.411 --> 22:21.011
You finish this.

22:22.881 --> 22:26.684
Wallowski walks out
before the interrogation
is over.

22:26.751 --> 22:28.085
Well, they've been
in there for 3 hours.

22:28.153 --> 22:29.620
I mean, maybe she just
needed a tinkle.

22:29.688 --> 22:32.089
Or maybe she was letting Farr
blow the interrogation.

22:32.157 --> 22:35.092
Is there anything here
you agree on?

22:35.160 --> 22:36.860
Yes.

22:36.928 --> 22:38.429
There's definitely some
kind of relationship

22:38.496 --> 22:40.297
between Detective Farr
and Suarez.

22:40.365 --> 22:43.434
Agreed. Farr does sound
compromised at times.

22:43.501 --> 22:46.370
Well, if Farr's dirty,
Wallowski's dirty.

22:46.438 --> 22:48.639
What's that?

22:48.707 --> 22:50.140
What is that,

22:50.208 --> 22:51.575
guilt by association?

22:51.643 --> 22:53.377
You may.
May I remind you--

22:53.445 --> 22:56.780
you've got an eyewitness.
I haven't forgotten.

22:56.848 --> 22:58.682
Wallowski's arraigned
in the morning.

22:58.750 --> 23:00.050
My hands are tied.

23:00.118 --> 23:01.952
She goes to county,
that's a death sentence.

23:02.020 --> 23:03.854
Well, she either
gives up her partner

23:03.922 --> 23:06.023
or she's on her own.

23:13.031 --> 23:14.965
Thanks for your help.

23:15.033 --> 23:17.134
Oh, you wanted me to lie.

23:17.202 --> 23:19.103
I see now.

23:22.507 --> 23:24.541
Mrs. Phillips,
are you comfortable?

23:24.609 --> 23:26.210
I saw what I saw.

23:26.277 --> 23:29.480
Let's just get on
with it, shall we?

23:29.547 --> 23:31.815
Ok, we just have
a quick video

23:31.883 --> 23:33.617
we'd like you
to take a look at.

23:35.787 --> 23:37.554
And when I turn it off,

23:37.622 --> 23:40.524
just give us as much detail
about it as you can.

23:48.266 --> 23:49.800
There were 3 people.

23:49.868 --> 23:52.736
A couple holding hands,
an old man in a ball cap,

23:52.804 --> 23:54.538
and a blue car parked.

23:57.909 --> 24:00.978
Do you know what
change blindness is,
Mrs. Phillips?

24:01.045 --> 24:01.979
Changed what?

24:02.046 --> 24:03.080
Change blindness.

24:03.148 --> 24:05.015
We see what we anticipate
we're going to see,

24:05.083 --> 24:06.150
even if it changes.

24:06.217 --> 24:09.420
The brain doesn't react
to the change.

24:09.487 --> 24:10.754
Right.
Like Charles here.

24:10.822 --> 24:13.957
This was actually Loker
just a minute ago.

24:15.727 --> 24:19.096
So, you saw Wallowski
drop Prince John off,

24:19.164 --> 24:21.265
but did you look away
for any time

24:21.332 --> 24:22.699
before the shooting started?

24:22.767 --> 24:24.868
I...

24:24.936 --> 24:27.237
I think I was
brewing coffee.

24:27.305 --> 24:29.006
And then when
the shooting started,

24:29.073 --> 24:32.009
you looked out the window,
you saw the shooter, right?

24:32.076 --> 24:35.012
Who you thought was
the same person you saw
with Prince John

24:35.079 --> 24:37.414
just moments earlier.

24:44.923 --> 24:46.857
I was about to bring you
that spoon.

24:46.925 --> 24:48.025
How did you get me out?

24:48.092 --> 24:49.760
Change blindness.

24:57.001 --> 24:59.970
What you lookin' at,
Flaco?

25:11.246 --> 25:13.014
Lovely weather we're having.

25:13.081 --> 25:15.850
I'm not talking
about Farr.

25:15.917 --> 25:17.251
Balmy for this time of year.

25:17.319 --> 25:18.419
You want me to talk
about Farr

25:18.487 --> 25:20.521
'cause you're working
with I.A., right?

25:20.589 --> 25:22.356
That's how you got me
out of jail,

25:22.424 --> 25:23.791
you're working
some kind of deal?

25:23.859 --> 25:26.827
Right. Well, that's that
out of the way, then.

25:26.895 --> 25:28.796
Where do we go now?

25:28.864 --> 25:30.931
Straight to sex?

25:32.067 --> 25:34.769
Look, you know
he's dirty, right?

25:34.836 --> 25:37.938
It's not exactly
breaking his heart
selling you out, by the way.

25:38.006 --> 25:40.408
What if he was?
And I'm not saying
that he is.

25:40.475 --> 25:41.409
Is what?

25:41.476 --> 25:42.476
Dirty.

25:42.544 --> 25:43.844
You just said it.

25:43.912 --> 25:45.846
There are two types
of dirty.

25:45.914 --> 25:48.382
One is who you are
and one happens to you.

25:48.450 --> 25:50.117
Oh, Farr's a victim.

25:50.185 --> 25:51.419
Do me a favor.

25:51.486 --> 25:53.587
Want to know
how it happens?

25:53.655 --> 25:54.522
How what happens?

25:54.589 --> 25:55.756
Corruption.

25:55.824 --> 25:56.824
You did it again.

25:56.892 --> 26:00.361
I'm too tired
for this.

26:00.429 --> 26:02.129
Well, humor me.

26:02.197 --> 26:03.764
I brought the wine.

26:05.834 --> 26:08.102
So we isolated
some of her reactions

26:08.170 --> 26:10.204
during the Suarez interrogation.

26:10.272 --> 26:13.774
First interview--
after a softball from Farr,

26:13.842 --> 26:15.710
she purses her lips,

26:15.777 --> 26:16.944
barely noticeable.

26:17.012 --> 26:20.715
5 months later,
she looks away, brow furrows,

26:20.782 --> 26:23.217
much more intense reaction.

26:23.285 --> 26:24.719
In an interrogation
last year,

26:24.786 --> 26:26.687
you see disgust around
her nose, on her mouth.

26:26.755 --> 26:29.757
And finally 6 weeks ago,

26:29.825 --> 26:32.460
her entire body
shifts away from Farr

26:32.527 --> 26:34.395
and she leaves the room.

26:34.463 --> 26:36.197
So, in terms
of intensity,

26:36.264 --> 26:38.232
her disgust
with Farr rises
from an "a" to an "e"

26:38.300 --> 26:39.934
in lock-step
with Suarez's crimes.

26:40.001 --> 26:42.770
As he went
from joyriding
to homicide.

26:43.572 --> 26:45.940
She's known all along

26:46.007 --> 26:48.509
that Suarez and Farr
had some kind of deal.

26:48.577 --> 26:50.711
Lightman's watched
all of these interviews.

26:50.779 --> 26:53.180
How could he miss this?

26:53.248 --> 26:55.850
Change blindness.

27:02.891 --> 27:05.025
That's not bad
for 7 bucks, eh?

27:05.093 --> 27:06.427
You know about wine?

27:06.495 --> 27:08.763
It's made from grapes.

27:12.033 --> 27:14.301
What do you do
when your partner
busts a 14-year-old

27:14.369 --> 27:15.770
with a few grams
of heroin?

27:15.837 --> 27:19.507
You send them to juvie
for a PhD. In criminology

27:19.574 --> 27:21.642
or cut 'em a break?

27:21.710 --> 27:23.411
I don't know.

27:23.478 --> 27:25.379
You tell me.

27:25.447 --> 27:26.747
You start small.

27:26.815 --> 27:29.583
You just fudge
some paperwork
here and there.

27:29.651 --> 27:31.419
Knock a banger
around a bit,

27:31.486 --> 27:32.953
get a shooter
out of him.

27:33.021 --> 27:38.592
You know, that's all very
interesting.

27:38.660 --> 27:41.429
But not one mention
of Detective Farr.

27:43.865 --> 27:46.100
I'm trying to tell you,
you get deep enough in,

27:46.168 --> 27:48.269
you can't get back out.

27:48.336 --> 27:50.604
You know, two dead bodies
is a world away

27:50.672 --> 27:53.441
from fudging a bit
of paperwork, darlin',

27:53.508 --> 27:55.042
really.

27:55.110 --> 27:59.380
So...Get on with it, then.

28:12.794 --> 28:14.061
Candles?

28:14.129 --> 28:17.364
Cabinet. Top left
of the stove.

28:17.432 --> 28:19.133
Sexy music.

28:19.201 --> 28:20.734
On it.

28:20.802 --> 28:23.170
Lube?

28:23.238 --> 28:24.171

there's nothing going on

30:30.466 --> 30:31.900
between Suarez and Farr?

30:31.967 --> 30:34.102
You want to talk
about this now?

30:34.169 --> 30:36.404
The I.A. leaned
on my partner

30:36.472 --> 30:39.674
to lean on me
to give you up.

30:39.742 --> 30:44.379
Now, I'm being disloyal
to my partner

30:44.446 --> 30:46.547
because you're being loyal
to a man

30:46.615 --> 30:48.082
who's up to his neck in it.

30:48.150 --> 30:52.987
You're saying Dr. Foster's
wrong about me?

30:53.055 --> 30:56.357
Like she's wrong about me
sometimes.

30:57.693 --> 31:00.662
It comes from a good place.

31:10.205 --> 31:14.008
You ever hear of
off-duty Booty?

31:19.548 --> 31:22.684
Suarez is Farr's son.

31:32.027 --> 31:35.129
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, mate.

31:36.098 --> 31:37.498
You.

31:37.566 --> 31:40.101
Raises the blood pressure,
you know?

31:40.169 --> 31:44.172
I me, if you want
a "get out of jail free"
pass from the I.A.,

31:44.239 --> 31:47.909
you might want to get it
under control, mate.

31:47.977 --> 31:49.844
All right, suit yourself.

31:49.912 --> 31:54.682
But it does make your neck
blob out a bit, you know?

31:56.585 --> 31:57.919
Oh, yeah.

32:00.322 --> 32:02.290
Wallowski?

32:06.295 --> 32:08.563
Well, you can stick
a fork in her and all,

32:08.630 --> 32:10.064
'cause she's cooked.

32:10.132 --> 32:12.333
You both are.

32:13.469 --> 32:17.572
Did you know that someone
shot up her house

32:17.639 --> 32:19.407
last night?

32:19.475 --> 32:21.542
Oh, first
you've heard of it.

32:21.610 --> 32:24.979
Well, that's
a good sign, I suppose.

32:25.047 --> 32:26.314
You want to know
who it was?

32:26.382 --> 32:27.515
It was your boy Suarez.

32:27.583 --> 32:29.584
And when I say your boy,

32:29.651 --> 32:31.853
what I mean is, your son.

32:32.921 --> 32:35.490
19 years old.

32:35.557 --> 32:38.059
Mowing his way through
his own gang

32:38.127 --> 32:39.660
while you look
the other way.

32:46.668 --> 32:48.102
You ok?

32:48.170 --> 32:49.704
I'm good.

32:49.772 --> 32:51.572
And so is Suarez.

32:53.609 --> 32:56.244
It starts simple.

32:56.311 --> 32:58.312
Right? You're just trying
to do the right thing,

32:58.380 --> 33:02.517
like any real dad would.

33:07.856 --> 33:10.425
You can't protect him anymore.

33:11.527 --> 33:14.629
He tried killing you
last night.

33:15.998 --> 33:17.865
Choose.

33:18.867 --> 33:21.736
Your partner...

33:21.804 --> 33:23.704
Or your son.

33:30.913 --> 33:33.714
Detective Farr.

33:55.104 --> 33:56.771
Get me Lightman.

33:56.839 --> 33:57.705
Now.

33:57.773 --> 33:59.073
He's not in yet.

33:59.141 --> 34:02.743
Well, he bends Farr's ear
before the hearing,

34:02.811 --> 34:04.712
Farr comes in and spills.

34:04.780 --> 34:06.347
Suarez is his son.

34:06.415 --> 34:08.616
He's been in the kid's pocket
for years.

34:11.152 --> 34:12.753
So you got your dirty cop.

34:12.821 --> 34:14.021
Congratulations.

34:14.089 --> 34:17.058
Farr's son killed Prince John
and Stomper

34:17.126 --> 34:18.993
because he knew
they were blackmailing Farr.

34:19.061 --> 34:21.195
And Wallowski knew it, too.

34:21.263 --> 34:22.496
She's dirty.

34:22.563 --> 34:26.400
I mean, 8-hour days
with Farr for 5 years?

34:26.467 --> 34:28.936
It doesn't sound
like proof.

34:29.004 --> 34:31.438
Farr takes the heat,
says Wallowski knows nothing.

34:31.507 --> 34:32.840
Lying through his teeth,

34:32.908 --> 34:34.876
and Lightman
put him up to it.

34:34.943 --> 34:37.512
Oh, this isn't about
Wallowski anymore, is it?

34:37.579 --> 34:39.213
It's about Lightman.

34:39.281 --> 34:40.781
You can choose--

34:40.849 --> 34:43.618
Wallowski or your partner.

34:43.685 --> 34:46.621
Because I will bring down
this whole circus act

34:46.688 --> 34:49.190
if I have to.

34:49.257 --> 34:50.958
Understand?

34:52.327 --> 34:55.329
Do you need that
in writing?

35:17.553 --> 35:20.755
Her contempt
for Farr's choices

35:20.822 --> 35:24.992
is getting harder
to contain.

35:25.060 --> 35:27.361
She knew about Suarez.

35:27.429 --> 35:30.164
And you're sure about that?

35:31.833 --> 35:34.402
Put her in the cube
for long enough,

35:34.469 --> 35:38.873
and if she's guilty,
she'll betray herself.

35:54.971 --> 35:58.808
The muscles in your cheek,
relax them.

35:58.875 --> 36:01.610
No, no. Hands down.

36:01.678 --> 36:03.913
You cover your mouth,

36:03.980 --> 36:06.115
you give yourself away.

36:07.317 --> 36:09.752
You know, if you teach me
how to lie,

36:09.820 --> 36:12.188
you might never
be able to trust me.

36:12.255 --> 36:15.024
All right, pay attention.

36:15.091 --> 36:17.693
Focus on what we're doing.

36:22.833 --> 36:25.534
You're not helping me.

36:25.602 --> 36:29.071
You're just trying
to save yourself now.

36:30.340 --> 36:32.942
That was good.

36:33.009 --> 36:35.611
You hid the contempt.

36:41.685 --> 36:45.287
There are 4 key emotions
displayed here.

36:45.355 --> 36:48.324
Disappointment, frustration,

36:48.391 --> 36:49.725
disgust,

36:49.793 --> 36:51.327
outrage.

36:51.394 --> 36:52.595
And just like contempt,

36:52.662 --> 36:55.064
any of these would
expose Wallowski's role

36:55.131 --> 36:57.233
in covering up
Farr's crimes.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.401
And you can show me
what to look for?

36:59.469 --> 37:00.503
And what to ask.

37:00.570 --> 37:02.238
Ask her a question
she doesn't expect.

37:02.305 --> 37:04.340
That's where you'll find
unfiltered emotion,

37:04.407 --> 37:07.710
something she won't
be able to hide.

37:10.313 --> 37:13.983
You knew there was
a relationship
between Farr and Suarez.

37:14.050 --> 37:15.918
They were friendly.

37:15.986 --> 37:17.553
Part of our work
with gang unit

37:17.621 --> 37:19.255
is to connect
with these kids.

37:19.322 --> 37:21.257
But I had no idea
until yesterday

37:21.324 --> 37:22.892
they were
father and son.

37:22.959 --> 37:26.562
Oh, that's good.
Nice.

37:30.200 --> 37:32.468
Lying comes naturally to you.

37:32.536 --> 37:34.637
Good teacher.

37:39.576 --> 37:44.246
Just part your lips
a little

37:44.314 --> 37:46.582
for surprise, you know.

37:46.650 --> 37:49.351
They'll be looking for that.

37:49.419 --> 37:53.088
I don't know
if I can do this.

37:53.156 --> 37:55.457
Of course you can.

37:55.525 --> 37:59.361
I can't lose the one cop
I can squeeze,

37:59.429 --> 38:01.997
on the street.

38:05.802 --> 38:08.237
Tell me a lie.

38:08.305 --> 38:10.806
Anything you like.

38:14.611 --> 38:16.946
I hate you.

38:31.394 --> 38:34.797
Now, that's brilliant.

38:39.936 --> 38:42.371
You're ready.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.542
You knew Detective Farr
had a relationship
with Marco Suarez?

38:46.610 --> 38:49.745
We're meant to form
relationships with
street-level dealers.

38:49.813 --> 38:50.846
But did you know

38:50.914 --> 38:52.514
he was helping Suarez
commit crimes?

38:52.582 --> 38:54.316
No. I didn't know anything
about that.

38:54.384 --> 38:56.986
But you do know
that he beat Prince John

38:57.053 --> 38:58.921
to cover his relationship
with Suarez,

38:58.989 --> 39:03.058
to support Suarez's move
to control the Nine-Sixes.

39:03.126 --> 39:06.128
Now that he's confessed,
sure, I guess.

39:06.196 --> 39:09.365
Was Detective Farr a good
father to his children?

39:09.432 --> 39:10.866
Which ones?

39:10.934 --> 39:14.203
To his regular
family ones.

39:14.270 --> 39:15.971
You mean his white ones.

39:16.039 --> 39:17.873
Don't deflect
the question, Detective.

39:17.941 --> 39:20.142
I'm sorry,
what was the question again?

39:20.210 --> 39:21.710
Oh, yeah. Uh,

39:21.778 --> 39:25.280
he's incredible
with his kids.

39:29.452 --> 39:32.321
Well, don't look at me, Loker.

39:32.389 --> 39:34.089
Give it to them straight.

39:35.625 --> 39:37.359
I get nothing here.

39:37.427 --> 39:39.361
Zip.

39:39.429 --> 39:41.964
Was Wallowski in on this
with Farr or not?

39:42.032 --> 39:43.632
She's been coached.

39:43.700 --> 39:44.800
Or maybe she's clean.

39:44.868 --> 39:46.502
And you Call yourself
scientists?

39:46.569 --> 39:49.738
You call cops
who disagree cops?

39:49.806 --> 39:51.340
Unless one of them's dirty.

39:51.408 --> 39:53.676
Well, she's saying
Wallowski's clean.

39:55.445 --> 39:57.880
Aren't you, Dr. Foster?

40:11.428 --> 40:13.729
Wait! What are you
walking away for, hey?

40:13.797 --> 40:15.264
That's not right.
Don't do that.

40:15.331 --> 40:16.465
Never mind.

40:16.533 --> 40:19.568
I'm not going anywhere,
Gill, so let's have it.

40:19.636 --> 40:21.737
What do you see in her, Cal?

40:21.805 --> 40:25.407
I'd have done the same thing
for my partner.

40:25.475 --> 40:27.476
It's called loyalty.

40:27.544 --> 40:30.012
That's kind of ironic

40:30.080 --> 40:32.281
from where I'm standing.

40:33.583 --> 40:35.718
Well?

40:35.785 --> 40:38.053
Is Wallowski lying?

40:44.160 --> 40:45.961
Yes.

40:46.029 --> 40:47.696
Absolutely.

40:49.132 --> 40:51.400
Farr is not a good dad.
She's covering for him.

40:51.468 --> 40:54.636
As for the rest of it,
she's not lying.

40:54.704 --> 40:57.606
She didn't know anything
about Suarez or any of it.

40:57.674 --> 41:00.109
D--Dr. Lightman?

41:04.714 --> 41:08.083
Yeah, she's clean.

41:08.151 --> 41:10.018

for you.
