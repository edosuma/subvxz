11:35.945 --> 11:36.569
HEY!

11:36.654 --> 11:39.489
LET'S WATCH THE LANGUAGE.

11:39.573 --> 11:43.159
THERE ARE, LIKE, SO MANY
RICH KIDS AT THIS TENNIS CAMP,
IT'S DISGUSTING.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.079
WELL, YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
IN THE SLUMS HERE, DARLING.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.665
THAT'S NOT EVEN THE POINT,
GRANDMA. THEY'RE SPOILED BRATS.

11:48.749 --> 11:51.000
THEN THEY SHOULD ELECT YOU
THEIR QUEEN.

11:51.085 --> 11:51.918
SHUT UP!

11:52.002 --> 11:54.587
Kathy: PLEASE DON'T FIGHT
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY. THANK YOU.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.673
Wendy: IT WAS SIX DAYS AGO.

11:56.757 --> 12:01.094
SPEAKING OF FIGHTS,
I SAW MYSELF ON TV LAST NIGHT.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.846
THEY SHOWED THE FIRST
CLAY-LISTON FIGHT

12:03.931 --> 12:06.432
ON THAT ESPN CLASSICS.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.018
I WAS THERE, OF COURSE,
COVERING FOR THE POST...

12:09.103 --> 12:12.855
AND WHEN LISTON
THREW IN THE TOWEL...

12:12.940 --> 12:14.941
FIRST MAN IN THE RING, KID!

12:14.984 --> 12:18.695
YEAH, YEAH, YOU TOLD ME
THAT ONCE, ACTUALLY.

12:18.779 --> 12:21.447
I ACTUALLY CAUGHT THE END
OF THAT LAST NIGHT, WARREN.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.616
YOU SEE ME, PAUL?
FIRST MAN IN THE RING.

12:23.701 --> 12:24.617
YEAH, YEAH, NO, I SAW YOU.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.869
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU
WERE THIRD GUY IN, THOUGH.

12:26.954 --> 12:27.870
WHAT?

12:27.955 --> 12:31.374
NO, NO, I'M NOT INCLUDING
LISTON AND CLAY!

12:31.458 --> 12:33.376
I'M TALKING ABOUT REPORTERS!

12:33.460 --> 12:34.460
YEAH, NO, NO, I KNOW,

12:34.545 --> 12:38.131
I JUST THINK THAT TWO REPORTERS
GOT IN RIGHT BEFORE YOU.

12:38.215 --> 12:40.383
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
WHO WAS IN BEFORE ME?

12:40.467 --> 12:42.885
- DAD, CALM DOWN.
- I SAID WHO WAS IN BEFORE ME?!

12:42.970 --> 12:43.636
CALM DOWN, DAD.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.555
ONE GUY HAD A HAT ON,
I THINK...

12:45.639 --> 12:46.472
THAT IS A LIE!

12:46.557 --> 12:47.974
I'M GONNA CALL
THE NETWORK RIGHT NOW

12:48.058 --> 12:49.475
AND I'M GONNA GET
A COPY OF THAT FILM!

12:49.560 --> 12:51.060
WARREN, DON'T START
CALLING PEOPLE.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.729
THEN TELL THE MAN
WHO WAS IN FIRST!

12:52.813 --> 12:55.648
YOU AND THE GUY WITH THE HAT
WERE PRETTY DARN CLOSE...

12:55.691 --> 12:57.400
SO I'M GONNA GIVE YOU SECOND.

12:57.484 --> 12:58.818
HEY, YOU WERE SECOND!

12:58.861 --> 13:01.988
FIRST, GOD DAMN IT!
IT'S DOCUMENTED! COME ON!

13:02.031 --> 13:03.990
GRANDPA, RELAX.
HE'S JUST SHITTING YOU.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.491
PAUL,
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

13:05.534 --> 13:07.994
IT'S A JOKE.
THAT WAS SO MEAN, DAD.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.078
FIRST MAN IN, WISEASS.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.497
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SAID
TO CLAY WHEN I RAN IN?

13:11.582 --> 13:15.168
I SAID, "CASSIUS,
YOU ARE THE GREATEST!"

13:15.210 --> 13:17.837
AND THAT'S WHERE HE GOT
THE MONIKER...

13:17.921 --> 13:18.755
FROM ME.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.798
OKAY, NOW THAT'S BULLSHIT.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.925
- IT'S WHAT?
- BULLSHIT.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.260
BULLSHIT BULLSHIT!

13:24.345 --> 13:26.596
GRANDPA, IT SPLATTER ME
EVERY TIME YOU DO THAT!

13:26.680 --> 13:28.890
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

13:33.520 --> 13:34.520
Paul: WARREN, YOU NEED ANOTHER?

13:34.563 --> 13:38.524
YEAH, I WANT A CHEESEBURGER
WITH TWO PIECES OF CHEESE ON IT.

13:38.609 --> 13:41.527
ONE FOR CLAY AND ONE FOR LISTER.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.117
JESUS, TAKE IT EASY, WILL YA?

13:48.202 --> 13:50.119
IT'S ONLY MY THIRD.

13:50.204 --> 13:50.953
YEAH, RIGHT.

13:51.038 --> 13:54.874
FUCK, IT'S HOT OUT THERE.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.797
(sighs)

14:02.049 --> 14:03.216
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:03.258 --> 14:05.218
LOOK, LET'S JUST SKIP
THE DANCE, OKAY?

14:05.302 --> 14:07.387
IF YOU WANNA SAY SOMETHING,
JUST SAY IT.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.556
- WHAT DO YOU THINK I WANNA SAY?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.642
I THINK YOU DO KNOW,
BECAUSE YOU JUST SAID THAT

14:12.726 --> 14:15.144
LIKE YOU KNEW WHAT YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS I WANTED TO SAY.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.814
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A DELIGHTFUL DRUNK.

14:17.898 --> 14:22.777
YOU'RE PARANOID AND INCOHERENT.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL COMBINATION.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.407
HOW COME
YOU'RE LATE SO MUCH?

14:27.491 --> 14:29.409
WORKING. IS THAT
A TOUGH CONCEPT?

14:29.451 --> 14:31.828
THEN HOW COME I GET
YOUR VOICE MAIL
ALL THE TIME?

14:31.912 --> 14:34.247
PROBABLY BECAUSE WHEN YOU
CALL ME, I'M IN A MEETING.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.749
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THIS,
WHAT'S-HER-NAME, JULIE?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.251
WHY DOESN'T SHE PICK UP?
WHERE'S SHE?

14:38.293 --> 14:40.336
'CAUSE SHE'S IN THE MEETINGS
WITH ME, OKAY?

14:40.421 --> 14:42.171
LAURA,
NOW YOU WANNA DROP THIS?
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR THIS.

14:42.256 --> 14:46.926
I'VE BEEN FEELING LIKE CRAP
ALL DAY, AND I'M NOT GONNA
TALK ABOUT THIS.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.684
ARE YOU GETTING SICK?

14:54.768 --> 14:56.310
NO, I'M NOT.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.522
IT'S JUST...

14:59.606 --> 15:03.025
DENNIS IS DISAPPOINTED
THAT YOU AREN'T COMING HOME
AS MUCH AS YOU PROMISED.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.528
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
DO SOMETHING WITH HIM, HUH?

15:05.612 --> 15:06.779
I WALK IN THE DOOR,
YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?

15:06.864 --> 15:08.364
HE'S IN FRONT OF THE COMPUTER,
AND WHERE ARE YOU?

15:08.449 --> 15:13.119
YOU'RE SITTING IN THE KITCHEN
AND YOU'RE SWILLING BEER!

15:13.162 --> 15:15.371
WE'RE DOING THE CAKE
FOR THE TWINS NOW.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.373
- I HAVE TO LIGHT THE CANDLES.
- I'LL DO IT.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.460
- OH, NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, DEAR.
- MOM, I'LL DO IT, OKAY?

15:20.544 --> 15:22.712
I'LL LIGHT THE CANDLES,
I'LL BRING OUT THE CAKE...

15:22.796 --> 15:24.630
AND EVERYONE WILL SING,
IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME, OKAY?

15:24.673 --> 15:26.716
SO I'VE GOT IT. THANK YOU.
BUH-BYE, BUH-BYE.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.302
- WELL, THEN DO IT NOW, PLEASE.
- I'M DOING IT, OKAY?!

15:29.344 --> 15:30.553
THEY'RE IN THE DRAWER
RIGHT THERE.

15:30.637 --> 15:35.141
SEE, I'VE GOT IT. THANK YOU,
OKAY. GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.976
THANK YOU.

15:38.687 --> 15:47.820
(sighs)

15:47.863 --> 15:49.739
DO YOU WANT ME
TO HELP YOU?

15:49.823 --> 15:51.324
NO.

16:08.342 --> 16:13.012
WAS ONE OF YOUR MEETINGS
AT THE CHEROKEE HOTEL?

16:13.055 --> 16:15.515
I FOUND THE RECEIPT
IN YOUR PANTS THIS MORNING

16:15.599 --> 16:18.267
WHEN I TOOK IT
TO TO THE DRY CLEANER.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.936
OH, CHRIST...

16:20.020 --> 16:21.270
IT'S THE IROQUOIS HOTEL,
ALL RIGHT?

16:21.355 --> 16:23.523
GET YOUR FUCKIN' INDIANS
STRAIGHT, AND YEAH,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:23.565 --> 16:25.775
IT WAS A MEETING, OKAY?
IT WAS A LUNCH MEETING.

16:25.859 --> 16:26.943
AND I SUBMITTED IT
FOR REIMBURSEMENT.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.861
WHAT DID YOU SUBMIT?
IT WAS IN YOUR PANTS.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.197
YOU GOT ME, COLUMBO.
YOU'RE BRILLIANT!

16:31.240 --> 16:32.615
OH, MY GOD!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

16:32.699 --> 16:34.700
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT FUCKING JULIE, OKAY?

16:34.785 --> 16:38.204
I'M NOT FUCKING THE ONE-ARMED
RECYCLING GUY OR ANYBODY ELSE.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.789
(sighs)

16:39.873 --> 16:41.207
YOU GOT A LOT
OF FUCKING NERVE

16:41.291 --> 16:42.625
BRINGING THIS ON ME,
TOO, ALL RIGHT?

16:42.709 --> 16:44.877
YOU CHECKED OUT
OF THIS MARRIAGE
WAY BEFORE I DID.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.463
NO, NO,
I CHECKED OUT AFTER YOU.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.130
WAY, WAY BEFORE.

16:48.215 --> 16:51.467
AFTER YOU! AFTER YOU STARTED
WORKING LATE ALL THE TIME

16:51.552 --> 16:53.386
AND NOT WANTING
TO HAVE SEX ANYMORE!

16:53.470 --> 16:54.971
YEAH, AFTER YOU STOPPED
TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF

16:55.055 --> 16:57.473
AND BEING SOMEBODY A PERSON
MIGHT WANNA COME HOME TO!

16:57.558 --> 17:00.226
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.813
(sighs)

17:03.897 --> 17:08.568
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THE CANDLES? ALL RIGHT,
THEY'RE 15, THEY'RE NOT 80.

17:13.448 --> 17:15.658
LAURA, COME ON!

17:20.330 --> 17:21.831
LAURA, STOP IT.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.417
DON'T LEAVE IT OPEN!

17:24.501 --> 17:26.919
IT'S RUDE!

17:30.090 --> 17:31.841
LAURA!

17:31.925 --> 17:35.011
LAURA, STOP IT!

17:35.095 --> 17:36.596
UGH!

17:38.974 --> 17:43.769
(groans)

17:52.446 --> 17:57.283
NORMAL, NORMAL,
NORMAL, NORMAL.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.702
I WAS HALFWAY HOME,
YOU KNOW.

17:59.786 --> 18:02.955
THEY CALLED ME
BACK FOR THIS.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.458
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
THINK IT WAS?

18:05.500 --> 18:06.792
THERE WAS NO CHEST PAIN, RIGHT?

18:06.877 --> 18:10.463
NO, NO, I WAS DIZZY,
I COULDN'T GET A FULL BREATH,

18:10.547 --> 18:13.132
AND IT WAS JUST A LOT OF THAT.

18:13.216 --> 18:14.300
HAPPENED BEFORE TONIGHT?

18:14.384 --> 18:17.053
UM, YEAH, A FEW TIMES,
AND ACTUALLY EARLIER TODAY.

18:17.137 --> 18:19.138
REALLY?
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.806
WELL, IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

18:20.849 --> 18:23.392
WELL, WHAT WERE YOU DOING
WHEN IT HAPPENED
THE OTHER TIMES?

18:23.477 --> 18:25.561
I WAS JUST IN MEETINGS.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.480
USE DRUGS, COCAINE?

18:27.522 --> 18:28.397
NO, NEVER.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.899
THAT'S TRUE, ACTUALLY.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.150
EVER FEEL IT
WHEN YOU'RE EXERCISING?

18:31.234 --> 18:36.489
I HAVEN'T WORKED OUT
IN A COUPLE WEEKS 'CAUSE
I'VE GOT A BAD ANKLE.

18:36.573 --> 18:40.910
DURING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE?

18:40.994 --> 18:43.079
UM...
I DON'T...

18:43.163 --> 18:44.664
WE HAVEN'T...

18:44.706 --> 18:46.499
IT'S BEEN
A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

18:46.583 --> 18:47.583
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.252
I THINK THE LAST TIME
WAS MEMORIAL DAY.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.004
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN MY PARENTS
TOOK DENNIS...

18:52.047 --> 18:54.757
ALL RIGHT, I DON'T THINK
HE NEEDS TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

18:54.841 --> 18:56.676
JESUS.

18:56.718 --> 18:59.929
I WAS JUST TRYING TO ANSWER
HIS SEXUAL INTERCOURSE QUESTION.

19:00.013 --> 19:03.933
YOU HAD AN ANXIETY ATTACK,
MY FRIEND.

19:04.017 --> 19:10.106
YOU EAT A COUPLE OF XANAX
BEFORE THOSE KILLER MEETINGS
OF YOURS.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.191
PAY UP FRONT.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.956
SO YOU'RE REALLY OKAY?

19:27.040 --> 19:28.374
I AM REALLY OKAY.

19:28.458 --> 19:31.961
GET SOME SLEEP.
IT'S LATE.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.714
CAN YOU PICK ME UP
FROM CAMP TOMORROW?

19:34.756 --> 19:36.382
WE'LL SEE.

19:37.467 --> 19:40.386
I WILL TRY.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.725
I LOST TWO POUNDS.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.895
GOODNIGHT, BUDDY.

19:49.938 --> 19:50.896
I LOVE YOU.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.440
(sighs)

20:46.119 --> 20:48.370

I TRUST YOU.

21:01.968 --> 21:05.721
I WANT YOU

21:05.806 --> 21:07.681

TAKING BETTER CARE
OF MYSELF.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.316
I WANNA LOOK GOOD

21:17.359 --> 21:21.987
I'M GONNA STOP SMOKING
AND DRINKING,
AND WORK OUT.

21:22.072 --> 21:27.910

HOURS AT WORK SO YOU CAN BE

39:28.908 --> 39:30.909
HIS HEART RATE
WAS DEFINITELY ELEVATED.

39:30.951 --> 39:33.077
SEE, THERE YOU GO.
WHAT WAS HE DOING?

39:33.162 --> 39:37.165
HE WAS...
I WAS...

39:37.249 --> 39:41.002
DOING A SEX ACT.

39:41.086 --> 39:43.171
OH. OKAY.

39:43.255 --> 39:44.339
A NORMAL ONE.

39:44.423 --> 39:46.591
NOTHING WITH LIKE ROPES OR...

39:46.634 --> 39:51.429
(chuckles) I GUESS THE FIGHT
WAS OVER THEN, HUH?

39:52.765 --> 39:53.765
ANYWAY, YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING.

39:53.849 --> 39:57.101
THE DOCTOR COULD HAVE
SAVED BOB'S LIFE WITH
A PROPER DIAGNOSIS,

39:57.186 --> 40:00.021
BUT HE WAS NEGLIGENT,
BOB DIED, SO HERE WE ARE.

40:00.105 --> 40:03.524
NOW, WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROCEED
WITH THE LAWSUIT?

40:03.609 --> 40:05.777
I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

40:05.861 --> 40:07.445
YOU DON'T THINK SO?

40:07.488 --> 40:14.118
IT'S JUST THAT, UM,
LAWSUITS AND SUING PEOPLE,

40:14.203 --> 40:16.537
IT'S NOT MY THING.

40:16.622 --> 40:17.455
SO, NO.

40:17.498 --> 40:20.291
LAURA, I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND...

40:20.376 --> 40:21.793
THIS IS AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE.

40:21.877 --> 40:24.796
THE INSURANCE COMPANIES
WILL NOT EVEN LET THIS
GO TO TRIAL,

40:24.880 --> 40:28.383
WE ARE GONNA SETTLE IN THE HIGH
SIX FIGURES, MAYBE SEVEN.

40:28.467 --> 40:32.637
THIS IS WHAT I KNOW FROM
22 YEARS OF LITIGATING.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.973
YEAH...

40:35.015 --> 40:37.183
NO, THANKS.

40:38.060 --> 40:44.065
LOOK, HERE'S THE THING...

40:44.149 --> 40:44.816
HE DID ASK.

40:44.858 --> 40:49.821
THE DOCTOR, HE ASKED BOB
IF HE WAS EXERCISING OR...

40:49.863 --> 40:52.490
HAVING SEX THE OTHER TIMES
HE GOT THE SYMPTOMS,

40:52.533 --> 40:56.995
AND BOB SAID NO,
THAT HE WAS JUST AT MEETINGS.

40:57.079 --> 40:59.080
THAT'S POSSIBLE,
AN ARRHYTHMIA CAN HAPPEN...

40:59.164 --> 41:00.498
WHAT IF HE WAS LYING?

41:00.541 --> 41:01.666
- WHO?
- BOB.

41:01.750 --> 41:04.585
ABOUT HIS HEART RATE BEING
ELEVATED THE OTHER TIMES.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.004
WHAT IF HE WAS LYING?

41:06.046 --> 41:06.838
WHY WOULD HE BE LYING?

41:06.880 --> 41:11.342
BECAUSE I WAS STANDING THERE.

41:14.847 --> 41:15.680
OKAY.

41:15.764 --> 41:18.933
SO, IF HE WAS LYING,
THAT CHANGES THINGS, RIGHT?

41:19.018 --> 41:24.188
I MEAN, AS FAR AS MALPRACTICE
IS CONCERNED, RIGHT?

41:25.274 --> 41:26.774
NO.

41:26.859 --> 41:28.109
NO?

41:28.193 --> 41:29.444
NO, NO.

41:29.528 --> 41:30.611
THIS, THIS LIE

41:30.696 --> 41:33.448
IS PURELY HYPOTHETICAL,
IT'S UNPROVABLE.

41:33.532 --> 41:36.034
- BUT, WAIT, WAIT, NO...
- IT'S NOT RELEVANT
WHAT MIGHT HAVE...

41:36.118 --> 41:39.370
IF BOB DIDN'T TELL THE DOCTOR
THE TRUTH ABOUT...

41:39.455 --> 41:41.247
LAURA! STOP!

41:42.875 --> 41:44.959
PLEASE.

41:45.044 --> 41:48.296
LOOK, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
A VERY MORAL, HONEST PERSON,
I'VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST THAT.

41:48.380 --> 41:51.799
BUT, LET'S LOOK AT
THE BIG PICTURE HERE, OKAY?

41:51.884 --> 41:52.717
YOU ARE THE VICTIM HERE.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.553
YOU'RE THE VICTIM
OF OTHER PEOPLE'S MISTAKES.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.805
THAT IS PRECISELY
WHY INSURANCE COMPANIES EXIST,

41:57.890 --> 42:03.227
TO PROTECT PEOPLE LIKE YOU
FROM GETTING WIPED OUT
FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S MISTAKES.

42:03.270 --> 42:04.562
WIPED OUT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WIPED OUT?

42:04.646 --> 42:07.815
- WELL, I DIDN'T WANNA ALARM YOU.
- YOU SAID EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.567
NO, I SAID THINGS
WOULD PROBABLY BE OKAY,

42:09.610 --> 42:12.570
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE PROCEEDING
WITH THE LAWSUIT.

42:12.613 --> 42:13.738
I JUST ASSUMED THAT YOU WOULD.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.991
BUT THE FACT IS BOB,
AS WE SAY IN THE LEGAL TRADE,

42:17.076 --> 42:18.659
FUCKED UP, OKAY?

42:18.744 --> 42:21.245
HE SHOULD'VE SET UP A TRUST
FOR YOU, HE DIDN'T.

42:21.288 --> 42:24.248
HE SHOULD HAVE
MORE LIFE INSURANCE FOR YOU,
HE DOESN'T.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.666
BY THE TIME YOU PAY
YOUR ESTATE TAXES,

42:25.751 --> 42:29.253
YOU WILL HAVE BASICALLY
NOTHING LEFT TO LIVE ON.

42:29.296 --> 42:30.838
I HAVE MY JOB.

42:30.923 --> 42:33.424
WHAT DOES THE DENTIST PAY YOU?
FORTY, FIFTY THOUSAND?

42:33.467 --> 42:34.175
THIRTY-EIGHT FIVE.

42:34.259 --> 42:38.262
BUT THEY ARE REALLY NICE
AND I CAN GET MORE HOURS.

42:38.305 --> 42:40.598
MM-HMM, WELL, UNLESS THEY'RE
NICE ENOUGH TO LET YOU

42:40.641 --> 42:43.017
AND YOUR SON LIVE
IN THEIR OFFICE,

42:43.102 --> 42:45.853
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

42:51.860 --> 42:53.945
CAN I PEE NOW?

43:04.665 --> 43:07.625
HEY, BUDDY.
DON'T SWEAT THIS TOO MUCH.

43:07.709 --> 43:11.045
YOU STILL GOT YOUR AMP OUT HERE
IF YOU WANNA COME OUT
AND PRACTICE.

43:11.130 --> 43:15.133
JUST MOVE IT AGAINST THE WALL
SO THERE'S ROOM FOR
YOUR MOM'S CAR.

43:15.175 --> 43:16.801
THAT'S WHY SHE'S
MAKING ME STOP THE BAND?

43:16.885 --> 43:20.138
SO SHE COULD PARK HER CAR
IN HER PRECIOUS GARAGE AGAIN?

43:20.180 --> 43:21.055
NO, NO, NO, WE TALKED.

43:21.140 --> 43:24.475
WE BOTH DECIDED YOU NEED
TO FOCUS ON SCHOOL
FOR A WHILE.

43:24.560 --> 43:29.147
HEY, TENTH GRADE,
IT ALL COUNTS NOW, RIGHT?

43:29.231 --> 43:32.483
SCHOOL BLOWS DOGS.

43:32.568 --> 43:39.657
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF IT BLOWS DOGS... PER SE.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.412
GOT A MESSAGE FOR YOUR WIFE...

43:44.496 --> 43:48.332
SHE GOT WHAT SHE WANTED,
SO SHE CAN GO FUCK HERSELF.

43:48.375 --> 43:49.083
GIVE HER THAT MESSAGE.

43:49.168 --> 43:54.088
OKAY, UH, SHOULD I HAVE HER
CALL YOU IF SHE HAS
ANY QUESTIONS OR?

43:54.173 --> 43:55.923
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

43:56.008 --> 44:00.344
AH, SHE REALLY WANTS HIM
TO STOP PLAYING FOR A WHILE
SO HE CAN GET HIS GRADES UP.

44:00.429 --> 44:00.928
YOU AGREED?

44:01.013 --> 44:05.433
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
SHE DOES HAVE A POINT.

44:05.517 --> 44:07.518
OH, JESUS!

44:24.203 --> 44:26.871
(children chattering)

44:46.391 --> 44:47.475
YO, GUYS, I GOTTA GO, ALL RIGHT?

44:47.559 --> 44:49.477
- SEE YA, DENNIS.
- SEE YA, GUYS.

44:49.561 --> 44:50.645
HEY, MOM.

44:50.729 --> 44:51.646
HEY, HONEY.

44:51.730 --> 44:55.233
HEY, SO IT LOOKS LIKE YOU MADE
SOME FRIENDS AFTER ALL, HUH?

44:55.317 --> 44:57.985
YEAH. COME ON, LET'S GO.

44:58.904 --> 45:00.905
- MRS. PEHLKE?
- YES?

45:00.948 --> 45:04.408
HI. I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
HI. I'M LILLY GALLAGHER.

45:04.493 --> 45:06.827
I'M DENNIS'
SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHER.

45:06.912 --> 45:09.080
OH, HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.

45:09.164 --> 45:09.830
NICE TO MEET YOU.

45:09.915 --> 45:11.582
LOOK, I'M SURE YOU
NEED TO GET GOING,

45:11.625 --> 45:13.334
BUT I JUST
WANTED TO, UM...

45:13.418 --> 45:16.379
I HEARD ABOUT
DENNIS' FATHER.

45:16.463 --> 45:18.172
OH, YEAH...

45:18.257 --> 45:20.508
I GUESS HE TOLD
SOME OF THE OTHER CHILDREN,
AND WORD GOT AROUND.

45:20.592 --> 45:24.178
I AM SO SORRY.
IT'S TRAGIC.

45:24.263 --> 45:25.012
THANK YOU.

45:25.097 --> 45:27.848
- I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD
IT'S BEEN FOR BOTH OF YOU.
- YEAH...

45:27.933 --> 45:32.436
ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED TO SAY,
FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH,

45:32.479 --> 45:34.772
HE WAS A TRUE HERO.

45:34.856 --> 45:37.858
YEAH...

45:37.943 --> 45:39.277
WHO?

45:39.361 --> 45:40.695
(dog barking)

45:40.779 --> 45:43.114
- YOU HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH!
- NO!

45:43.156 --> 45:46.033
DENNIS, YOUR FATHER
DID NOT DIE IN 9/11!

45:46.118 --> 45:48.035
I KNOW,
BUT WHAT'S COOLER, OKAY?

45:48.120 --> 45:51.372
WHAT'S A COOLER WAY TO DIE,
9/11 OR A U-RITHMA THING?

45:51.456 --> 45:54.709
- DENNIS!
- WHAT'S COOLER?!

45:54.793 --> 45:56.794
9/11 IS COOLER, BUT...

45:56.878 --> 45:58.212
IT IS COOLER!

45:58.297 --> 45:58.796
DENNIS!

45:58.839 --> 46:02.466
IF YOU DON'T TELL THE TRUTH,
I'M GONNA CALL THE SCHOOL
MYSELF!

46:02.551 --> 46:03.384
NO! YOU CAN'T!

46:03.468 --> 46:05.386
EVERYONE'LL THINK I'M A FREAK!
YOU CAN'T!

46:05.470 --> 46:07.054
WELL, I CAN'T JUST LET PEOPLE
THINK THAT...

46:07.139 --> 46:08.389
WHAT DO YOU EVEN CARE,
ANYWAY?!

46:08.473 --> 46:09.724
THE SCHOOL'S LIKE
FIVE TOWNS AWAY!

46:09.808 --> 46:12.059
- IT DOESN'T AFFECT YOU!
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT!

46:12.144 --> 46:14.312
YOU CAN'T JUST LIE
TO PEOPLE LIKE THAT!

46:14.396 --> 46:16.647
OH, MY GOD!
ALL YOU EVER DO IS LIE!

46:16.732 --> 46:20.484
YOU MAKE UP ALL THESE
LAME EXCUSES TO PEOPLE
FOR NOT BEING SOMEWHERE!

46:20.569 --> 46:22.570
YOU LIE TO DAD ABOUT
HOW MANY BEERS YOU HAD!

46:22.654 --> 46:24.488
YOU SAY YOU DON'T SMOKE
BUT YOU REALLY DO!

46:24.573 --> 46:26.490
THOSE ARE DIFFERENT!
THOSE ARE TINY LITTLE THINGS!

46:26.575 --> 46:31.579
AND THEY DON'T INVOLVE
MAJOR EVENTS OF WORLD HISTORY!

46:31.663 --> 46:32.163
OH!

46:32.247 --> 46:34.582
(dog continues barking)

46:34.666 --> 46:35.416
WHAT'S WRONG?

46:35.500 --> 46:39.170
I WANNA KILL THAT DOG
SO MUCH!

46:42.007 --> 46:45.259
OKAY, WHAT DID
YOU SAY, EXACTLY?

46:45.344 --> 46:50.848
THAT HIS REAL ESTATE OFFICE
WAS IN ONE OF THE TOWERS,
OR SOMETHING?

46:50.891 --> 46:54.769
I...
I SAID HE WAS A FIREMAN.

46:54.853 --> 46:55.436
WHAT?

46:55.520 --> 46:58.773
HE BROUGHT THREE PEOPLE OUT
AND WENT BACK IN.

46:58.857 --> 47:00.858
- WHY DID YOU SAY THAT?!
- IT'S COOLER!

47:00.901 --> 47:03.527
WHY DID YOU SAY ANY OF IT?!
WHY?!

47:03.570 --> 47:04.528
- I DON'T KNOW!
- WHY?!

47:04.613 --> 47:05.696
I DON'T KNOW!
I JUST SAID IT!

47:05.781 --> 47:10.451
SOME KID WAS ASKING ME
STUFF ABOUT MYSELF,
AND I JUST SAID IT!

47:10.535 --> 47:12.453
SHUT UP!

47:12.537 --> 47:16.123
COME BACK HERE!
COME BACK HERE!

47:42.567 --> 47:47.321
(computer beeps)

48:23.942 --> 48:26.360
(typing)

48:29.781 --> 48:31.782
(computer beeps)

48:40.625 --> 48:45.004
MRS. PEHLKE,
DID YOU LOVE YOUR HUSBAND?

48:49.176 --> 48:50.301
YES.

48:50.343 --> 48:52.136
I'M SORRY, COULD YOU SPEAK UP,
PLEASE?

48:52.220 --> 48:54.638
YES. YES, I CAN SPEAK UP.

48:54.681 --> 48:57.475
AND I LOVED HIM. YES TO BOTH.

48:57.517 --> 48:58.976
WERE YOU HAPPY
IN YOUR MARRIAGE?

48:59.060 --> 49:03.522
WERE YOU SATISFIED AND CONTENT
WITH THE RELATIONSHIP?

49:04.858 --> 49:07.735
YES, IT ALWAYS MADE ME
VERY HAPPY AND PROUD

49:07.819 --> 49:10.988
TO BE MARRIED
TO SUCH A BRAVE...

49:11.031 --> 49:13.908
FIREMAN, LIKE HIM.

49:13.992 --> 49:15.993
AND I'LL ALWAYS BE PROUD
OF THE FACT THAT,

49:16.036 --> 49:21.874
BEFORE HE DIED,
HE WAS ABLE TO SAVE THOSE...

49:23.001 --> 49:24.668
THREE PEOPLE.

49:24.711 --> 49:27.087
WHAT WAS THE LAST THING
HE SAID TO YOU THAT MORNING?

49:27.172 --> 49:28.172
I DON'T REMEMBER, EXACTLY.

49:28.215 --> 49:31.425
AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
I WAS A LITTLE INTOXICATED.

49:31.510 --> 49:33.844
AND DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU SAID TO DR. BRONSTEIN?

49:33.929 --> 49:39.016
ABOUT THE LAST TIME
YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE?

49:39.100 --> 49:40.267
YEAH.

49:40.352 --> 49:43.270
WE HADN'T HAD SEX SINCE...

49:43.355 --> 49:45.272
MEMORIAL DAY.

49:45.357 --> 49:49.693
OH, THAT'S SO SAD.

49:49.736 --> 49:53.531
(horn honking)

49:53.573 --> 49:56.867
WENDY, COME ON!

49:59.746 --> 50:00.287
WHERE IS SHE?!

50:00.372 --> 50:02.623
PROBABLY HAVING
A GRAND MAL SEIZURE
FROM THE HONKING.

50:02.707 --> 50:05.626
SHE'S THE ONE WHO WANTED TO GET
IN EARLY FOR DEBATE CLUB.

50:05.710 --> 50:08.629
WAIT, WHY ARE YOU HERE?
SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT WORK?

50:08.713 --> 50:10.631
I HAD SOME STUFF TO DO FIRST.

50:10.715 --> 50:12.633
(honks)

50:12.717 --> 50:13.551
WENDY!

50:13.593 --> 50:17.221
I COULDN'T FIND MY HAT!
MY GOD!

50:17.305 --> 50:18.889
- BYE, WENDY.
- BYE, DADDY.

50:18.932 --> 50:21.308
- SEE YOU TONIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

50:24.604 --> 50:26.146
JESUS.

50:28.567 --> 50:30.276
SEE YA, DAD.

50:36.449 --> 50:40.995
(cars honking)

50:41.955 --> 50:45.499
GOD, THIS TRAFFIC IS...

50:45.584 --> 50:48.669
YOU KNOW WHAT MY DAD USED
TO SAY WHEN I WAS LITTLE?

50:48.753 --> 50:54.425
THE LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY

50:54.509 --> 50:56.927

52:02.035 --> 52:05.329
THAT WE HAVE THE MAN,
THE INNOVATOR HIMSELF

52:05.413 --> 52:06.997
RIGHT HERE IN OUR STUDIO...

52:07.040 --> 52:08.832
LIVING LEGEND DION DiMUCCI.

52:08.917 --> 52:10.417
- WELCOME, SIR.
- THANK YOU.

52:10.502 --> 52:12.002
DAN, GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

52:12.045 --> 52:14.838
WELL, APPARENTLY YOU DON'T AGE,
BECAUSE YOU LOOK

52:14.881 --> 52:17.341
JUST LIKE THE KID
WHO CAME OUT OF THE BRONX.

52:17.425 --> 52:18.175
YEAH, RIGHT. SURE.

52:18.218 --> 52:21.845
I'M GLAD WE'RE ON RADIO HERE
SO NO ONE CAN DISPUTE THAT.

52:21.888 --> 52:25.015
SO YOU'VE GOT A NEW RECORD
COMING OUT, RIGHT?

52:25.058 --> 52:27.101
- CD.
- YEAH, THAT'S THE WORD.

52:27.185 --> 52:27.935
CD.

52:28.019 --> 52:29.853
YEAH, BUT THEY LOOK LIKE
LITTLE RECORDS, DON'T THEY?

52:29.896 --> 52:31.522
SO TELL ME,
THESE ARE ALL NEW VERSIONS,

52:31.606 --> 52:35.192
NEW MASTERS OF YOUR CLASSICS,
RIGHT? HOW'D THAT COME ABOUT?

52:35.276 --> 52:36.026
NO WAY.

52:36.069 --> 52:38.278
JUST A LABOR OF LOVE.

52:38.363 --> 52:42.199
I HAVE A GREAT BAND.
YOU KNOW, THE OLD RECORDS
ARE SHORT.

52:42.283 --> 52:43.867
WE WANTED TO LENGTHEN THEM.

52:43.952 --> 52:44.702
IT'S A PARTY ALBUM.

52:44.786 --> 52:47.204
OH, OH, IT'S LIKE
DOUG CLARK AND THE HOT NUTS?

52:47.288 --> 52:48.706

53:03.138 --> 53:05.389
LAST NIGHT,
I WAS AT THE COLISEUM

53:05.473 --> 53:07.224

ULTIMATE FIGHTING THING.

53:07.308 --> 53:08.225
OH, I LOVE U.F.C.

53:08.309 --> 53:09.560

54:59.921 --> 55:01.755
YEAH.

55:01.840 --> 55:03.757
WOW...

55:03.842 --> 55:05.175

FROM YOU.

55:07.262 --> 55:09.221
(all laugh)

55:10.056 --> 55:12.850
SO WHAT DID THEY FINALLY
GET FOR THAT PLACE ACROSS
THE STREET, DO YOU KNOW?

55:12.934 --> 55:17.020
THE FISHBECKS? LAST I HEARD
THEY DROPPED IT TO LIKE
A MILLION FOUR.

55:17.105 --> 55:20.440
I TALKED TO MIRANDA,
THAT REALTOR WE KNOW,
YESTERDAY.

55:20.525 --> 55:21.942
SHE SAID A MILLION TWO.

55:22.026 --> 55:23.861
THEY TOOK ONE...
(scoffs)

55:23.903 --> 55:25.946
NO BALLS, MAN,
NO BALLS AT ALL.

55:26.030 --> 55:28.448
THE FISHBECKS? NO,
THE FISHBECKS HAVE
PLENTY OF BALLS.

55:28.533 --> 55:33.954
HE'S GOT ONE, AND THE WIFE
HAS GOT HALF A DOZEN, AT LEAST.

55:34.038 --> 55:36.039
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

55:36.124 --> 55:38.625
- THE FISHBECKS.
- WOULD YOU JUST STOP?

55:38.710 --> 55:40.127
AND BY THE WAY,
WHY DID YOU TELL MIRANDA

55:40.211 --> 55:42.379
THAT I WAS
THREE YEARS OLDER THAN YOU?

55:42.463 --> 55:43.463
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

55:43.548 --> 55:45.048
SHE SAID YOU SAID THREE.
IT'S ONE.

55:45.091 --> 55:45.883
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THREE?

55:45.967 --> 55:46.967
I DON'T KNOW...
I ROUNDED UP?

55:47.051 --> 55:50.470
YOU LOOK YOUNGER
WITH YOUR HAIR LONGER,
I'VE TOLD YOU THAT.

55:50.555 --> 55:53.390
KATHY LOOKS VERY GOOD
FOR HER AGE.

55:53.474 --> 55:55.392
YEAH, 90.

55:55.435 --> 55:56.226
(chuckles)

55:56.311 --> 56:01.648
BY THE WAY, SMARTY, HOW'D YOU DO
ON YOUR MATH TEST TODAY?

56:03.234 --> 56:04.151
FINE.

56:04.235 --> 56:05.402
"FINE"? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

56:05.445 --> 56:06.653
DOES THAT MEAN YOU PASSED OR?

56:06.738 --> 56:08.906
- HE WASN'T IN SCHOOL TODAY.
- WHAT?

56:08.948 --> 56:09.823
YOU LITTLE TWAT.

56:09.908 --> 56:11.325
HE CAN'T CALL ME THAT!
PUNISH HIM!

56:11.409 --> 56:13.827
I CAN SAY "TWAT."
HE JUST SAID "BALLS."

56:13.912 --> 56:16.580
I WASN'T REFERRING
TO AN ACTUAL PAIR OF TESTICLES.

56:16.623 --> 56:20.083
AND I WASN'T REFERRING
TO AN ACTUAL TWAT.

56:20.126 --> 56:20.751
STOP THAT!

56:20.835 --> 56:21.293
(laughs)

56:21.377 --> 56:23.253
DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM.
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

56:23.338 --> 56:25.589
COME ON,
WHAT THE HELL DID I SAY?!

56:25.632 --> 56:27.758
OKAY, EVERYBODY, PLEASE.

56:27.842 --> 56:29.343
THANK YOU.

56:29.427 --> 56:31.178
NOW, WHY WEREN'T YOU
IN SCHOOL TODAY?

56:31.262 --> 56:35.140
NOT THAT IT'S GONNA PREVENT
YOUR PUNISHMENT, BUT WHY?

56:37.435 --> 56:42.189
I TOOK HIM DOWN TO THE STATION
WITH ME... TO MEET DION.

56:42.273 --> 56:45.359
"DION"? DION WHO?

56:45.443 --> 56:47.277
DION DiMUCCI.

56:47.320 --> 56:49.363
YOU KNOW... DION.

56:49.447 --> 56:50.781
I... I'M STUNNED, PAUL.

56:50.865 --> 56:54.451
I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE
GONNA TRY TO HELP OUR SON
GET AN EDUCATION.

56:54.494 --> 56:57.287
- I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT...
- YOUR SON IS FAILING MATH.

56:57.372 --> 56:58.705
I KNOW, BUT DION IS A LEGEND.

56:58.790 --> 57:01.875
HIS MUSIC WILL BE AROUND
A LOT LONGER THAN MATH.

57:01.960 --> 57:04.795
OH, RIGHT,
IT'S A JOKE AGAIN, RIGHT.

57:04.837 --> 57:08.465
OH, I GUESS I'M JUST TOO OLD
TO UNDERSTAND.

57:08.549 --> 57:10.050
YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM DONE.

57:10.134 --> 57:12.052
YOU RAISE YOUR SON BY YOURSELF.

57:12.136 --> 57:14.888
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN JUST TAKE HIM
OUT OF SCHOOL

57:14.973 --> 57:16.890
AND GO ON TOUR
WITH HIS BAND.

57:16.975 --> 57:18.725
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.
COOL.

57:18.810 --> 57:21.144
KATHY, IT WAS ONE TIME.

57:21.187 --> 57:23.021
KATHY...

57:25.024 --> 57:31.488
I ONCE PICKED UP BUDDY HOLLY...
HITCHHIKING.

57:31.531 --> 57:33.865
OH, STOP IT.

57:45.336 --> 57:48.505
- HELLO?
- OH, MY GOD.

57:48.589 --> 57:49.506
HEY, HI.

57:49.590 --> 57:51.091
SORRY, YOU SCARED ME.

57:51.175 --> 57:51.758
YOU SCARED ME.

57:51.843 --> 57:54.261
I THOUGHT YOU WERE WATCHING
THE GAME WITH MY DAD.

57:54.345 --> 57:58.265
YEAH, NO, I WAS.
I JUST CAME OUT HERE TO...

57:59.350 --> 58:00.350
OH, OKAY.

58:00.393 --> 58:04.604
WELL, I JUST CAME OUT
FOR A BEER AND A SMOKE MYSELF.

58:04.689 --> 58:05.439
THE OTHER KIND.

58:05.523 --> 58:08.191
AH, A LITTLE IMPROMPTU
DEGENERACY FESTIVAL.

58:08.276 --> 58:11.862
THAT'S EXCITING.
COME ON UP.

58:16.409 --> 58:17.284
MM?

58:17.368 --> 58:18.368
MM, NO, THANKS.

58:18.411 --> 58:21.038
POT MAKES ME
KINDA PARANOID.

58:21.080 --> 58:22.289
ALL RIGHT.

58:22.373 --> 58:24.041
(chuckles)

58:26.711 --> 58:27.961
LOOK, YOUR MOM!

58:28.046 --> 58:29.713
OH, GOD.

58:31.716 --> 58:34.384
(both laugh)

58:34.427 --> 58:35.385
OH, GOD DAMN IT.

58:35.428 --> 58:36.636
WOW, YOU START OFF PARANOID.

58:36.721 --> 58:38.805
OH, NO,
THAT'S ALL I NEED RIGHT NOW

58:38.890 --> 58:42.559
IS FOR MY MOTHER
TO CATCH ME SMOKING POT.

58:42.643 --> 58:43.393
WHAT COULD SHE DO?

58:43.436 --> 58:47.064
WHAT COULD SHE POSSIBLY
DO TO YOU AT THIS POINT
IN YOUR LIFE?

58:47.106 --> 58:48.231
I DON'T KNOW.

58:48.316 --> 58:52.110
MORE OF THE SAME, I GUESS.

59:00.578 --> 59:04.748
SO DOES KATHY KNOW
YOU COME OUT HERE TO?

59:04.791 --> 59:07.417
(chuckles)
GOD, NO.

59:07.460 --> 59:09.753
ARE YOU KIDDING?
SHE'D PASS OUT.

59:09.837 --> 59:12.756
AND ON THE WAY DOWN,
SHE'D CALL THE FBI.

59:12.799 --> 59:14.925
(both laugh)

59:15.009 --> 59:17.761
NO, I KEEP MY WEED STASH
WELL HIDDEN...

59:17.845 --> 59:21.014
JUST RIGHT NEXT
TO MY KIDDIE PORN.

59:21.099 --> 59:24.518
- YOU DON'T HAVE KIDDIE PORN.
- NO...

59:24.602 --> 59:25.769
NOT KIDDIE.

59:25.853 --> 59:27.771
I DON'T KNOW...
WHAT'S THE CUTOFF?

59:27.814 --> 59:30.524
STOP IT.
YOU'RE MAKING ME WONDER.

59:30.608 --> 59:34.778
OH, NO, I'M JUST
A MID-LEVEL PERV,
NOTHING EXCEPTIONAL.

59:34.821 --> 59:38.281
ALTHOUGH, I GUARANTEE YOU,
EVERY MAN WORRIES WHAT HIS WIFE

59:38.324 --> 59:42.202
WILL FIND IN HIS CLOSET
IF HE DROPS DEAD ONE DAY.

59:42.954 --> 59:44.287
OH, GOD. I AM SORRY.

59:44.330 --> 59:50.627
THAT'S WAS WHAT YOU CALL...
RIGHT THERE, THAT'S WHAT
YOU CALL A FAUX PAS.

59:50.670 --> 59:51.878
(both chuckle)

59:51.963 --> 59:53.130
DON'T WORRY.

59:53.214 --> 59:54.297
IT'S THE WEED.

59:54.382 --> 59:57.968
THEY SHOULD
MAKE THIS STUFF ILLEGAL.

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:05.308
SO, HOW YOU DOING
WITH ALL THAT, ANYWAY?

1:00:05.351 --> 1:00:08.812
WHAT, WIDOWHOOD?

1:00:08.855 --> 1:00:09.980
YEAH.

1:00:10.064 --> 1:00:11.314
UM...

1:00:11.399 --> 1:00:14.985
FINE, I GUESS.

1:00:15.027 --> 1:00:16.653
(chuckles)
"FINE?"

1:00:16.696 --> 1:00:20.407
I DON'T KNOW,
I MEAN, I'M A MESS,
BUT I WAS A MESS BEFORE,

1:00:20.491 --> 1:00:24.828
SO I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S FROM WHAT.

1:00:24.871 --> 1:00:27.330
IT'S GOTTA BE
DIFFERENT, THOUGH.

1:00:27.373 --> 1:00:30.250
I GUESS.

1:00:34.505 --> 1:00:37.090
THE LIES ARE DIFFERENT.

1:00:38.843 --> 1:00:42.929
OH, HERE'S SOMETHING
THAT'S DIFFERENT...

1:00:43.014 --> 1:00:47.100
UM, A GUY ASKED ME OUT TODAY.

1:00:47.185 --> 1:00:48.435
WHAT? WHO?

1:00:48.519 --> 1:00:52.606
THIS GUY, A PATIENT,
BUT NOT ONE OF MINE USUALLY.

1:00:52.690 --> 1:00:54.024
I WAS COVERING FOR DONNA.

1:00:54.066 --> 1:00:58.862
UM, HE'S A COMPUTER
SOMETHING-OR-OTHER.

1:00:58.946 --> 1:01:00.363
WOW.

1:01:00.406 --> 1:01:03.116
GOIN' OUT WITH HIM OR?

1:01:03.201 --> 1:01:03.950
NO. NO.

1:01:04.035 --> 1:01:08.622
I MEAN, HE'S OKAY LOOKING,
AND HE'S NICE, BUT...

1:01:08.706 --> 1:01:11.708
I DON'T KNOW,
IT WAS JUST WEIRD
THAT IT HAPPENED,

1:01:11.751 --> 1:01:13.793
YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE
OUT OF THE BLUE.

1:01:13.878 --> 1:01:17.464
WELL, YOU'VE GOT THAT ALLURE,
LAURA PEHLKE. THAT ALLURE!

1:01:17.548 --> 1:01:22.302
YEAH, I THINK IT WAS
THE BLOODY SMOCK THAT
PUT HIM OVER THE EDGE.

1:01:22.386 --> 1:01:24.221
(both laugh)

1:01:24.263 --> 1:01:25.889
OH, MAN.

1:01:25.973 --> 1:01:27.557
WHEN I WAS ON THE TENNIS TEAM
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

1:01:27.642 --> 1:01:31.061
I USED TO CHECK YOU OUT
ALL THE TIME FROM
THE PRACTICE COURTS.

1:01:31.145 --> 1:01:36.483
YOU AND THOSE OTHER TWO GIRLS,
ALWAYS SMOKING BEHIND THE GYM.

1:01:36.567 --> 1:01:40.153
OH, UM, BRITTANY NUZZOLESE
AND RHONDA CALVARUSO.

1:01:40.238 --> 1:01:42.322
- YES! OH, MY GOD.
- YEAH.

1:01:42.406 --> 1:01:43.907
YOU HAD THOSE RED JEANS.

1:01:43.991 --> 1:01:46.576
(both laugh)

1:01:46.661 --> 1:01:47.744
AND THAT LAUGH.

1:01:47.828 --> 1:01:49.996
OH, THAT LAUGH...
IT MADE ME NUTS.

1:01:50.081 --> 1:01:56.419
I USED TO PURPOSELY
HIT THE BALL OVER THE FENCE
AND GO, "A LITTLE HELP!"

1:01:56.504 --> 1:01:57.837
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

1:01:57.922 --> 1:01:59.005
UM...

1:01:59.090 --> 1:02:01.341
I THINK SO.

1:02:01.425 --> 1:02:03.677
YEAH, YOU NEVER HELPED.

1:02:03.761 --> 1:02:08.098
I'M SORRY. I WAS KIND OF
OBLIVIOUS BACK THEN.

1:02:08.140 --> 1:02:10.016
I STILL AM, I GUESS.

1:02:10.101 --> 1:02:14.604
BUT YOU KNEW I WAS IN LOVE
WITH YOU SINCE, LIKE,
SEVENTH GRADE, RIGHT?

1:02:14.689 --> 1:02:15.438
NO.

1:02:15.523 --> 1:02:17.190
- (laughs) NO.
- COME ON.

1:02:17.275 --> 1:02:19.192
HOW CAN YOU BE
THAT OBLIVIOUS, LAURA?

1:02:19.277 --> 1:02:20.860
I USED TO TALK TO YOU
EVERY DAY...

1:02:20.945 --> 1:02:22.696
ABOUT SOME STUPID
HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT

1:02:22.780 --> 1:02:24.864
OR WHATEVER CRAZY THING
I COULD COME UP WITH.

1:02:24.949 --> 1:02:27.784
AND YOU WERE ALWAYS
REALLY POLITE TO ME,
WHICH I APPRECIATED,

1:02:27.827 --> 1:02:31.538
BUT THEN AS SOON AS YOU
COULD MANAGE IT, YOU'D...

1:02:31.622 --> 1:02:33.456
PFFT! JUST WALK AWAY.

1:02:33.499 --> 1:02:35.959
I REMEMBER I THOUGHT
YOU WERE FUNNY.

1:02:36.002 --> 1:02:37.877
OH, WELL, THAT'S NICE.

1:02:37.962 --> 1:02:40.213
NO, I DIDN'T MIND
YOU WALKING AWAY.

1:02:40.298 --> 1:02:43.383
THEN I GOT TO WATCH YOU
GO DOWN THE HALL.

1:02:43.467 --> 1:02:45.218
YOU HAD THAT GREAT ASS...

1:02:45.303 --> 1:02:47.053
OH, HAD.

1:02:47.138 --> 1:02:48.221
YEAH.

1:02:48.306 --> 1:02:48.972
HAVE.

1:02:49.056 --> 1:02:50.890
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SORRY.

1:02:50.975 --> 1:02:52.726
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT
TONIGHT!

1:02:52.810 --> 1:02:55.061
- AND I'M GONNA SHUT UP.
- NO.

1:02:55.146 --> 1:02:56.896
MMM. (kisses)

1:03:02.820 --> 1:03:08.658
CAN I ADMIT SOMETHING REALLY
STRANGE AND DISTURBING
BECAUSE I'M STONED?

1:03:08.701 --> 1:03:09.659
PLEASE.

1:03:09.702 --> 1:03:11.745
(both chuckle)

1:03:11.829 --> 1:03:12.996
OKAY...

1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:16.166
UM, THIS IS GONNA SOUND...

1:03:16.250 --> 1:03:20.170
(sighs)
OKAY, WOW.

1:03:21.839 --> 1:03:26.760
OKAY, THE MAIN...
NOT THE MAIN REASON,
BUT A BIG REASON

1:03:26.844 --> 1:03:30.347
THAT I MARRIED KATHY...

1:03:30.389 --> 1:03:33.350
WAS THAT SHE
WAS YOUR SISTER.

1:03:34.185 --> 1:03:40.940
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT
IF I COULD BE MARRIED TO YOU,

1:03:41.025 --> 1:03:44.361
EVERYTHING WOULD BE OKAY.

1:03:46.030 --> 1:03:50.367
BUT THAT WASN'T
GONNA HAPPEN, RIGHT?

1:03:50.451 --> 1:03:53.953
SO THERE WAS YOUR SISTER.

1:03:54.038 --> 1:03:55.372
SHE WASN'T AS PRETTY AS YOU,

1:03:55.456 --> 1:03:58.041
BUT SHE WORE HER HAIR
LONGER THEN.

1:03:58.125 --> 1:04:03.922
AND FROM CERTAIN ANGLES
I COULD KIND OF IMAGINE
THAT SHE WAS YOU.

1:04:07.301 --> 1:04:09.427
SO I MARRIED HER.

1:04:19.605 --> 1:04:21.064
HUH.

1:04:24.735 --> 1:04:28.822
HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

1:04:28.906 --> 1:04:31.282
NOT SO WELL.

1:04:41.419 --> 1:04:42.168
WHERE WERE YOU?

1:04:42.253 --> 1:04:44.921
HAVING A CIGARETTE.
DON'T START.

1:04:45.005 --> 1:04:47.674
I WASN'T GOING TO SAY A WORD.

1:04:47.758 --> 1:04:49.592
Paul: BACK FROM MY WALK!

1:04:49.677 --> 1:04:53.096
GOD, HE'S OBSESSED.
HE WALKS EVEN IN A BLIZZARD.

1:04:53.139 --> 1:04:54.681
(phone rings)

1:04:54.765 --> 1:04:58.184
SO, I SPENT A FEW MINUTES
WITH DENNIS.

1:04:58.269 --> 1:05:01.771
HE SEEMS ALL RIGHT,
CONSIDERING.

1:05:01.856 --> 1:05:03.857
YEAH, HE'S ALL RIGHT.

1:05:03.941 --> 1:05:06.776
SO, THE NEW SCHOOL
IS WORKING OUT, THEN.

1:05:06.819 --> 1:05:09.779
IN ITS WAY, YES.

1:05:09.822 --> 1:05:10.613
OKAY, SWEETHEART.

1:05:10.656 --> 1:05:13.867
Kathy: SHE'S RIGHT HERE.
HANG ON A SEC.

1:05:13.951 --> 1:05:17.704
LAURA? IT'S FOR YOU.
IT'S MEL.

1:05:17.788 --> 1:05:19.372
MEL? WHY IS HE
CALLING ME HERE?

1:05:19.457 --> 1:05:24.836
HE SAID HE'S BEEN TRYING
TO FIND YOU ALL DAY,
SO HE DECIDED TO TRY HERE.

1:05:25.629 --> 1:05:26.379
HELLO?

1:05:26.464 --> 1:05:27.797
YOU GOTTA BE PICKING UP
YOUR MESSAGES, KID.

1:05:27.840 --> 1:05:30.800
I CAN'T BE HUNTING YOU DOWN
LIKE THIS WHEN I NEED YOU.

1:05:30.885 --> 1:05:31.801
SORRY. WHAT'S UP?

1:05:31.844 --> 1:05:34.888
HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW
THIS GIRL WHO WORKED WITH BOB...

1:05:34.972 --> 1:05:36.973
JULIE CANTONI?

1:05:37.016 --> 1:05:37.724
WHAT ABOUT HER?

1:05:37.808 --> 1:05:39.559
THE OTHER SIDE CALLED HER IN
FOR A DEPOSITION.

1:05:39.643 --> 1:05:42.979
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.
ANY IDEA WHY?

1:05:43.981 --> 1:05:48.151
SHE'S THE ONE, RIGHT?
SHE'S THE GIRL?

1:05:50.196 --> 1:05:51.571
LAURA?

1:05:51.655 --> 1:05:52.155
YEAH.

1:05:52.198 --> 1:05:55.742
YEAH, WELL,
DON'T SWEAT IT TOO MUCH, KID.

1:05:55.826 --> 1:05:57.577
I MEAN, REALLY...

1:05:57.661 --> 1:05:59.662
EVEN IF SHE DOES TELL,
IT WON'T KILL THE CASE.

1:05:59.747 --> 1:06:02.081
IT JUST MIGHT MAKE THEM
FEEL MORE BOLD, THAT'S ALL.

1:06:02.166 --> 1:06:04.167
- MEANING WHAT?
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

1:06:04.210 --> 1:06:06.586
THESE THINGS
ARE SUCH PSYCH-OUT GAMES.

1:06:06.670 --> 1:06:09.088
THE WORST CASE IS THEY
LOWBALL US ON THE SETTLEMENT

1:06:09.173 --> 1:06:10.840
AND WE'RE FORCED TO GO
WIN THIS THING IN COURT.

1:06:10.925 --> 1:06:14.511
NOW, HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW
THIS JULIE CHARACTER?

1:06:14.553 --> 1:06:15.595
THINK SHE'LL SAY ANYTHING?

1:06:15.679 --> 1:06:17.263
I DON'T...
ARE YOU EATING?

1:06:17.348 --> 1:06:20.016
THE THING IS,
OUR LIFE WOULD BE A LOT EASIER

1:06:20.059 --> 1:06:22.685
IF SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
AT ALL ABOUT...

1:06:22.728 --> 1:06:25.021
YOU KNOW...

1:06:25.105 --> 1:06:27.106
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

1:06:27.191 --> 1:06:29.776
IT IS WHAT IT IS, RIGHT?
WHAT CAN WE DO?

1:06:29.860 --> 1:06:33.196
I KNOW IT'S LATE.
I'M GONNA LET YOU GO, LAURA.

1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:35.114
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

1:06:37.368 --> 1:06:38.117
(phone beeps)

1:06:38.202 --> 1:06:41.204
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?

1:06:41.288 --> 1:06:42.205
WHAT?

1:06:42.289 --> 1:06:45.792
WITH THE LAWSUIT.
HOW FAR ALONG IS IT?

1:06:45.876 --> 1:06:47.210
UM, IT'S...

1:06:47.294 --> 1:06:49.879
I THINK I'M GONNA
DROP IT, ACTUALLY.

1:06:49.922 --> 1:06:52.215
DROP IT? NOW? WHY?

1:06:52.258 --> 1:06:55.552
KATHY, I HATE THIS THING
SO MUCH.

1:06:55.594 --> 1:06:57.053
I CAN'T KEEP...

1:06:57.137 --> 1:06:59.973
I JUST NEED TO MOVE FORWARD,
YOU KNOW?

1:07:00.057 --> 1:07:00.890
THAT'S INSANE, LAURA!

1:07:00.975 --> 1:07:02.892
I KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T FUN,
BUT RIGHT NOW

1:07:02.977 --> 1:07:04.811
IT'S YOUR
WHOLE FINANCIAL FUTURE!

1:07:04.895 --> 1:07:08.314
I CAN FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO MANAGE.
PEOPLE DO IT.

1:07:08.399 --> 1:07:11.317
WE CANE MOVE
INTO AN APARTMENT OR...

1:07:11.402 --> 1:07:13.486
NO, BUT YOU'RE SO FAR
INTO IT NOW!

1:07:13.571 --> 1:07:16.197
MEL SAID THE DEPOSITIONS
ARE ALMOST OVER!

1:07:16.282 --> 1:07:20.702
IF YOU KNOW THAT,
WHY DID YOU JUST ASK ME
HOW FAR ALONG IT WAS?

1:07:20.786 --> 1:07:22.328
I DON'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS.

1:07:22.413 --> 1:07:25.164
I RAN INTO HIM AT A PARTY
AND HE MENTIONED IT.
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

1:07:25.249 --> 1:07:26.583
KATHY, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DO IT?

1:07:26.625 --> 1:07:30.253
WHY DON'T YOU SUE DR. BRONSTEIN
AND TELL ME HOW IT
ALL COMES OUT, OKAY?

1:07:30.296 --> 1:07:32.755
- OH, WILL YOU JUST GROW UP!
- WHAT? IT WAS YOUR IDEA
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:34.507
I'M OBVIOUSLY JUST GETTING
IN THE WAY HERE!

1:07:34.592 --> 1:07:36.509
OH, I AM SO SICK
OF THIS FAMILY

1:07:36.594 --> 1:07:38.678
TREATING ME LIKE
AN OVERBEARING WITCH!

1:07:38.762 --> 1:07:42.765
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS KILLED
BY AN INCOMPETENT DOCTOR...

1:07:42.850 --> 1:07:44.517
AM I NOT SUPPOSED TO CARE?

1:07:44.602 --> 1:07:46.185
YOU CARE TOO MUCH.

1:07:46.270 --> 1:07:47.604
DO YOU CARE AT ALL?

1:07:47.646 --> 1:07:48.271
GO TO HELL.

1:07:48.314 --> 1:07:49.606
BECAUSE I
REALLY WONDER SOMETIMES...

1:07:49.648 --> 1:07:54.110
DO YOU EVEN SLIGHTLY APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU GOT WHEN YOU
MARRIED BOB?

1:07:54.153 --> 1:07:57.196
WHAT YOU
WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET?

1:07:57.281 --> 1:07:58.448
"LUCKY"?

1:07:58.490 --> 1:07:59.115
YEAH, LUCKY.

1:07:59.199 --> 1:08:03.202
BEING PRETTY IS LUCK, LAURA,
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

1:08:07.499 --> 1:08:09.208
(phone rings)

1:08:09.293 --> 1:08:10.877
Woman: McDARE AND ARNOLD?

1:08:10.961 --> 1:08:14.505
YEAH, THIS IS JULIE. WHO'S THIS?

1:08:24.308 --> 1:08:28.811
UM, I DON'T, UH...

1:08:28.854 --> 1:08:31.648
I MEAN, I REALLY WANNA
HELP YOU, MRS. PEHLKE.

1:08:31.690 --> 1:08:38.655
IT'S JUST THAT LAWYER GUY
SAID IT'S, LIKE, ILLEGAL TO...

1:08:43.327 --> 1:08:45.995
NO, I KNOW.

1:08:46.747 --> 1:08:50.500
WELL HE JUST SAID
IF I DON'T TELL THE TRU...

1:08:57.007 --> 1:08:58.675
OKAY.

1:09:02.513 --> 1:09:06.265
OKAY, I WILL.

- HEY, LAURA.

1:10:45.783 --> 1:10:46.866
- HI, SORRY I'M LATE.
- HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

1:10:46.950 --> 1:10:49.118
I MISSED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES.
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS IN A...

1:10:49.161 --> 1:10:51.954
REALLY? I THINK
I SAID THAT WHEN WE
SPOKE THE OTHER NIGHT.

1:10:52.039 --> 1:10:53.456

1:10:53.540 --> 1:10:57.293

HI.

- THANKS.

1:11:10.015 --> 1:11:10.473
OH.

1:11:10.557 --> 1:11:14.143
I'M GLAD YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND
ABOUT GETTING TOGETHER.

1:11:14.186 --> 1:11:17.730
TO BE HONEST, I DIDN'T
EXPECT TO HEAR FROM YOU.

1:11:17.815 --> 1:11:18.481
WELL, YOU DID.

1:11:18.565 --> 1:11:23.319
YEAH, AND YOU LOOK
PRETTY GREAT.

1:11:23.403 --> 1:11:24.987
THANKS.

1:11:26.406 --> 1:11:29.242
(truck beeping)

1:11:29.326 --> 1:11:33.412

A DELIVERY OR SOMETHING.

1:11:33.497 --> 1:11:34.247
(laughs)

1:11:34.331 --> 1:11:38.251
YOU KNOW HOW THOSE TRUCKS ARE.

1:11:38.335 --> 1:11:40.586
HEY, GUYS. CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

1:11:40.671 --> 1:11:41.754
BEER, GLASS OF WINE?

1:11:41.839 --> 1:11:43.256
DOUBLE VODKA ON THE ROCKS.

1:11:43.340 --> 1:11:46.843
YEAH, UM, SAME.
I'LL TAKE THE SAME.

1:11:46.927 --> 1:11:50.012

1:11:51.765 --> 1:11:55.017
SO...

1:11:55.060 --> 1:11:56.686
WHAT DO YOU DO AGAIN?

1:11:56.770 --> 1:11:59.438
DO I SMELL OATMEAL AND SALAD?

1:11:59.523 --> 1:12:01.274

1:14:22.708 --> 1:14:23.165

I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

1:14:26.503 --> 1:14:28.671
YEAH. I JUST NEED TO GO CHANGE.

1:14:28.755 --> 1:14:30.339
- DENNIS IS...
- WHAT?

1:14:30.382 --> 1:14:32.008
OH, JUST, DENNIS IS IN THE DEN,
WATCHING TV.

1:14:32.050 --> 1:14:33.509
HE FINISHED ALL OF HIS HOMEWORK
EXCEPT FOR THE MATH.

1:14:33.552 --> 1:14:38.347
I DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND IT,
SO I COULDN'T REALLY HELP HIM.
CAN I SHOW YOU?

1:14:44.104 --> 1:14:46.772
SEE? IT'S LIKE
METRIC CONVERSION STUFF.

1:14:46.857 --> 1:14:48.607
WE NEVER EVEN
LEARNED THIS AT SCHREIBER.

1:14:48.692 --> 1:14:50.526
IT'S LIKE
DECIMETERS AND STUFF.

1:14:50.569 --> 1:14:52.028
I TOLD HIM
YOU MIGHT KNOW IT BECAUSE

1:14:52.070 --> 1:14:54.447
I FIGURED YOU LEARNED IT
AT HYGIENIST SCHOOL, MAYBE.

1:14:54.531 --> 1:14:55.197
HEY, MOM.

1:14:55.240 --> 1:14:56.282
I'M SHOWING HER THE MATH.

1:14:56.366 --> 1:14:58.784
- SHE WON'T KNOW IT.
- MAYBE SHE WILL.

1:14:58.869 --> 1:15:00.119
- DID YOU?
- WHAT?

1:15:00.203 --> 1:15:03.372
DID YOU LEARN METRIC CONVERSION
IN DENTAL HYGIENIST SCHOOL?

1:15:03.415 --> 1:15:05.541
UH, YEAH. I DON'T KNOW.

1:15:05.584 --> 1:15:07.877
LISTEN, AMANDA, YOU CAN GO.
WHAT DO I OWE YOU?

1:15:07.961 --> 1:15:10.379
TWENTY, BUT I WAS GONNA DO
THE DISHES FIRST.

1:15:10.464 --> 1:15:11.797
OH, NO, THAT'S OKAY,
YOU CAN JUST LEAVE.

1:15:11.882 --> 1:15:14.633
I WOULD'VE DONE THEM BEFORE,
BUT THE HOMEWORK THING
SLOWED ME DOWN.

1:15:14.718 --> 1:15:16.218
IT'LL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE.

1:15:16.261 --> 1:15:16.886
(dog barking)

1:15:16.928 --> 1:15:21.057
HEY, MOM, THIS KID FROM SCHOOL
ASKED ME TO GO TO HIS
BIRTHDAY PARTY TOMORROW.

1:15:21.099 --> 1:15:24.101
CAN YOU TAKE ME?
IT'S IN GLEN COVE.

1:15:24.186 --> 1:15:27.646
I THINK SO. I HAVE TO MEET
WITH THE LAWYER TOMORROW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME.

1:15:27.731 --> 1:15:30.816
PLEASE, JUST LEAVE THEM.
YOU KNOW WHAT MY MOM SAYS?

1:15:30.901 --> 1:15:32.651
WHEN YOU BABYSIT,
LEAVE THE KITCHEN
CLEANER THAN...

1:15:32.736 --> 1:15:33.861
LEAVE THEM!

1:15:37.074 --> 1:15:38.783
LEAVE 'EM.

1:15:42.913 --> 1:15:45.081
I'M SORRY.

1:15:46.333 --> 1:15:47.583
THANK YOU.

1:15:47.626 --> 1:15:48.918
GOOD NIGHT, DENNIS.

1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:50.461
SEE YA.

1:15:57.094 --> 1:15:59.595
WHAT'S WITH YOU?

1:15:59.679 --> 1:16:00.846
WHERE DID YOU EVEN GO TONIGHT?

1:16:00.931 --> 1:16:03.599
I WENT OUT WITH A FRIEND.
NOW GO TO BED.

1:16:03.683 --> 1:16:05.851
(dog continues barking)

1:16:05.936 --> 1:16:07.019
DID SOMETHING BAD HAPPEN?

1:16:07.104 --> 1:16:10.606
GOD DAMN IT,
WHY WON'T YOU JUST SHUT UP?

1:16:10.649 --> 1:16:13.692
- I JUST ASKED IF...
- PLEASE STOP! PLEASE!

1:16:13.777 --> 1:16:15.528
- MOM! I DIDN'T...
- IT'S THE DOG!

1:16:15.612 --> 1:16:18.948
IT'S THE FUCKING DOG!

1:16:54.192 --> 1:16:56.318
HEY! DOUCHEBAG!

1:16:56.403 --> 1:17:00.573
YOU WANT THE BALL?
YOU WANT THE BALL?

1:17:00.657 --> 1:17:04.076
COME ON! GET THE BALL!
GET THE BALL! THAT'S RIGHT!

1:17:04.161 --> 1:17:07.663
GET THE BALL! THAT'S RIGHT!
GET THE BALL!

1:17:07.706 --> 1:17:10.082
HEY, ASSHOLE! FETCH!

1:17:10.167 --> 1:17:12.168
HEY! HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

1:17:12.252 --> 1:17:14.086
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT
TO MY DOG?!

1:17:14.171 --> 1:17:15.671
- OH, SHIT!
- COME BACK HERE!

1:17:15.714 --> 1:17:18.007
GINGER!
I SAW WHAT YOU DID!

1:17:18.091 --> 1:17:21.343
GO GET MY DOG!
THAT'S MY DOG! GINGER!

1:17:21.428 --> 1:17:25.681
I SAW WHAT YOU DID!
I SAW WHAT YOU DID!

1:17:25.765 --> 1:17:27.183
YOU COME BACK HERE!

1:17:27.267 --> 1:17:28.684
MRS. COSOLITO,
WHAT HAPPENED?

1:17:28.727 --> 1:17:32.188
YOUR SON TRIED TO KILL MY DOG!
HE TRIED TO KILL MY DOG!

1:17:32.272 --> 1:17:33.856
WHAT?! DENNIS!

1:17:33.899 --> 1:17:34.690
WHERE'S THE DOG?

1:17:34.774 --> 1:17:36.692
I DON'T KNOW,
SHE RAN AFTER THE BALL!

1:17:36.735 --> 1:17:40.112
SHE'S NEVER BEEN OUT
OF THAT YARD, SHE'LL GET LOST!
SHE'LL GET KILLED!

1:17:40.197 --> 1:17:42.031
GOOD! THAT STUPID DOG
SHOULD GET KILLED!

1:17:42.073 --> 1:17:45.117
WHAT KIND OF MOTHER RAISES
A MONSTER LIKE THAT?!

1:17:45.202 --> 1:17:49.622
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE MOTHER!
A TERRIBLE MOTHER!
I HEAR THINGS!

1:17:49.706 --> 1:17:50.456
FUCK YOU! SHUT UP!

1:17:50.540 --> 1:17:55.461
YOU SHUT UP!
HAVEN'T YOU DONE
ENOUGH ALREADY?!

1:17:55.545 --> 1:17:56.045
FIND MY DOG!

1:17:56.129 --> 1:17:58.380
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I'LL FIND HER.

1:17:58.423 --> 1:17:59.798
FIND GINGER,
OR I'LL TELL THE POLICE!

1:17:59.883 --> 1:18:01.967
I HAVE A NEPHEW WITH
THE NASSAU COUNTY POLICE!

1:18:02.052 --> 1:18:03.802
I'LL TELL HIM
WHAT YOUR SON DID!

1:18:03.887 --> 1:18:05.971
I'LL TELL HIM WHAT KIND
OF A MOTHER YOU ARE!

1:18:06.056 --> 1:18:08.307
WHAT KIND OF MONSTER
YOU RAISED!

1:18:08.391 --> 1:18:17.274
GINGER!

1:18:38.630 --> 1:18:41.966
(panting)

1:18:46.763 --> 1:18:48.430
(computer beeps)

1:19:11.871 --> 1:19:13.455
YOU SUCK!

1:19:13.498 --> 1:19:17.626
AND THIS... CANNOT...

1:19:17.669 --> 1:19:20.796
BE... IN MY... HOUSE!

1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:23.299
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? HUH?
TELL EVERYONE THE TRUTH?

1:19:23.341 --> 1:19:26.552
- GO AHEAD, I DON'T CARE!
- NO! I DON'T CARE!

1:19:26.636 --> 1:19:29.722
YOU CAN TELL PEOPLE THAT
YOUR FATHER WAS SPIDERMAN,
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT!

1:19:29.806 --> 1:19:34.643
YOU ARE SUCH AN ASSHOLE TO ME!
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE!

1:19:34.686 --> 1:19:40.524
- GOOD! YOU SUCK, ANYWAY!
- YOU SUCK! YOU!

1:19:42.652 --> 1:19:44.528
(door slams)

1:20:04.674 --> 1:20:07.259
(children chattering)

1:20:21.524 --> 1:20:25.527
THIS OFFER IS BULLSHIT.
IT'S JUST BULLSHIT.

1:20:25.612 --> 1:20:26.695
CAN I SEE IT?

1:20:26.738 --> 1:20:28.614
NO, 'CAUSE IT'S BULLSHIT.

1:20:28.698 --> 1:20:29.531
CAN I SEE IT?

1:20:29.616 --> 1:20:30.866
YOU WANNA SEE
BULLSHIT?

1:20:30.909 --> 1:20:33.285
I WANNA SEE THE PAPER.

1:20:33.370 --> 1:20:34.787
IT'S 150,000.

1:20:34.871 --> 1:20:36.121
THAT'S A BIG
"GO FUCK YOURSELF."

1:20:36.206 --> 1:20:37.623
WE CAN THANK BUSH FOR THAT,
THAT VICIOUS LITTLE PRICK.

1:20:37.707 --> 1:20:41.543
HE'S GOT HIS BUDDIES DOWN THERE
IN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES
PLAYING SO ROUGH NOW...

1:20:41.628 --> 1:20:44.630
I WANNA GET A RESPONSE
BACK TO THEM TODAY.

1:20:44.714 --> 1:20:45.964
I'LL TAKE IT.

1:20:46.049 --> 1:20:48.300
NO, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TAKE IT, LAURA.

1:20:48.385 --> 1:20:49.968
WHEN SOMEONE SAYS,
"GO FUCK YOURSELF"

1:20:50.053 --> 1:20:52.638
YOU DON'T GO FUCK YOURSELF,
DO YOU?

1:20:52.722 --> 1:20:53.472
SOMETIMES.

1:20:53.556 --> 1:20:56.141
LISTEN TO ME,
THE COURTS IN THIS DISTRICT
ARE SOLIDLY PRO-PLAINTIFF.

1:20:56.226 --> 1:21:00.229
WE WILL WIN THIS JUDGMENT,
IT'S JUST MIGHT GET
A LITTLE BLOODY, THAT'S ALL.

1:21:00.271 --> 1:21:03.315
THEY'RE GONNA BRING UP
BOB'S AFFAIR WITH THE GIRL.

1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:04.316
SHE TOLD?

1:21:04.401 --> 1:21:07.569
YEAH. YEAH, SHE TRIED TO LIE,
BUT THEY TRIPPED HER UP.

1:21:07.654 --> 1:21:08.654
IT WAS KINDA COMICAL,
ACTUALLY.

1:21:08.738 --> 1:21:10.072
BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
TRUST ME, OKAY?

1:21:10.115 --> 1:21:13.909
IN FACT, I THINK
IT'S GONNA MAKE THE JURY
MORE SYMPATHETIC TO YOU.

1:21:13.993 --> 1:21:16.912
MEL, 150 IS ENOUGH.
I CAN MANAGE ON THAT.

1:21:16.955 --> 1:21:18.831
- LAURA...
- I JUST WANT THIS TO BE OVER!

1:21:18.915 --> 1:21:22.167
LAURA!
WE'RE GONNA WIN THIS CASE, OKAY?

1:21:22.252 --> 1:21:24.002
GOD DAMN IT!

1:21:24.087 --> 1:21:26.171
DO YOU WANNA LIVE
HAND-TO-MOUTH?

1:21:26.256 --> 1:21:29.425
DON'T YOU WANT
A LITTLE SECURITY HERE?

1:21:30.260 --> 1:21:35.097
LET'S THINK ABOUT
DAVID HERE, HUH?

1:21:38.685 --> 1:21:41.019
DENNIS.

1:21:44.607 --> 1:21:47.276
HOW LONG'S IT GONNA TAKE?

1:21:47.360 --> 1:21:52.030
TWO YEARS, MAYBE THREE.

EVERYONE THINKS THE PITCHER
HAS THE BALL, BUT REALLY
THE FIRST BASEMAN HAS THE BALL,

1:22:27.817 --> 1:22:30.652
AND EVERYTHING'S
GOING GOOD FOR THE OTHER TEAM.

1:22:30.695 --> 1:22:32.362
COOL PARTY, HUH?

1:22:33.239 --> 1:22:33.822
UH, YEAH.

1:22:33.865 --> 1:22:37.659
SO EVERYTHING'S GOING GOOD.
THERE'S A MAN ON FIRST
AND A MAN ON THIRD.

1:22:37.702 --> 1:22:38.994
I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO STAY THE WHOLE TIME.

1:22:39.037 --> 1:22:44.750
ME AND MY MOM WERE
MAYBE GONNA HEAD DOWN
TO GROUND ZERO A LITTLE LATER.

1:22:44.834 --> 1:22:45.501
COOL.

1:22:45.543 --> 1:22:47.169
BUT IF THE PITCHER
GOES ON THE RUBBER,

1:22:47.212 --> 1:22:49.671
THEN IT'S A BALK,
AND THEN YOU GET YOUR BASE.

1:22:49.756 --> 1:22:51.673
YOU GET A FREE BASE.

1:22:51.716 --> 1:22:53.759
SO WHEN THE RUNNER
TAKES HIS LEAD...

1:22:53.843 --> 1:22:55.594
WE'VE GOT NEWS AND WEATHER
COMIN' UP,

1:22:55.678 --> 1:23:01.683
BUT RIGHT NOW,
JERRY RAFFERTY ON WCLX CLASSICS.

1:23:01.768 --> 1:23:06.438
ENOUGH OF THIS DION SHIT,
LET'S GET AVRIL LAVIGNE
DOWN HERE, HUH?

1:23:06.523 --> 1:23:08.440
AVRIL LAVIGNE?
ARE YOU LISTENING TO THIS?

1:23:08.525 --> 1:23:11.527
WHAT? I'D BANG HER. PUT A BAG
OVER HER HEAD FIRST, BUT...

1:23:11.569 --> 1:23:15.447
YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO.
THERE'D ALREADY BE A BAG
OVER YOUR HEAD.

1:23:15.532 --> 1:23:17.533
HO! HO!

1:23:17.575 --> 1:23:18.867
COMEDY!

1:23:18.910 --> 1:23:20.035
PAUL?

1:23:20.119 --> 1:23:21.203
YEAH, RHONDA?

1:23:21.287 --> 1:23:26.542
YOU HAVE KIND OF A WEIRD CALL
ON LINE TWO.

1:23:27.710 --> 1:23:28.544
WHO?

1:23:28.586 --> 1:23:30.295
SHE WOULDN'T
SAY HER NAME.

1:23:30.380 --> 1:23:31.797
SOUNDED LIKE
SHE WAS CRYING.

1:23:31.881 --> 1:23:35.801
Dan: OOH, MAYBE THE HOOKER
FROM THE QUEENSBOROUGH BRIDGE.

1:23:35.885 --> 1:23:38.053
THE TRANNY!

1:24:09.586 --> 1:24:12.504
HI.

1:24:12.589 --> 1:24:15.757
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?

1:24:15.842 --> 1:24:19.845
WE USED TO ALL
SKATE HERE. REMEMBER?

1:24:19.929 --> 1:24:21.263
YEAH.

1:24:21.347 --> 1:24:25.434
THE SECURITY GUY
TOLD ME THEY'RE NOT
OPENING IT AT ALL THIS YEAR.

1:24:25.518 --> 1:24:27.477
THEY'RE GONNA REDO
THE WHOLE THING.

1:24:29.772 --> 1:24:34.776
SO IS THAT WHY
YOU CALLED ME HERE?

1:24:34.819 --> 1:24:38.155
NO. I WENT...

1:24:38.865 --> 1:24:41.533
I WENT TO A BAR.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE CALLED YOU.

1:24:41.618 --> 1:24:45.704
I'M SORRY.
(sniffles)

1:24:45.788 --> 1:24:48.373
IT'S OKAY. HEY.

1:24:48.458 --> 1:24:50.542
WHAT DID YOU WANNA TELL ME?

1:24:50.627 --> 1:24:54.630
I CAN'T. I CAN'T, PAUL.

1:24:54.672 --> 1:24:58.967
JUST TELL ME.
HEY, IT'S OKAY.

1:24:59.010 --> 1:25:04.848
IT'S OKAY. WHAT?

1:25:05.725 --> 1:25:09.645
I WISH I WOULD'VE RETURNED
YOUR TENNIS BALL.

1:25:11.898 --> 1:25:13.315
IN HIGH SCHOOL?

1:25:13.399 --> 1:25:16.151
WHEN YOU SAID,
"A LITTLE HELP"?

1:25:16.235 --> 1:25:19.988
I WISH I WOULD'VE HELPED.

1:25:20.823 --> 1:25:23.492
WE HAD A WHOLE BASKET
OF BALLS.

1:25:23.534 --> 1:25:24.326
(chuckles)

1:25:24.369 --> 1:25:30.248
BUT I DIDN'T HELP.
I DIDN'T HELP.

1:25:30.333 --> 1:25:35.337
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
I SHOULD'VE DONE BACK THEN.

1:25:35.380 --> 1:25:39.675
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
ANYTHING BACK THEN.

1:25:39.717 --> 1:25:48.016
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
UNTIL ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO,
AND NOW...

1:25:48.059 --> 1:25:51.853
NOW, WHAT?

1:25:51.938 --> 1:25:57.025
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S JUST...

1:25:57.944 --> 1:26:01.029
YOU KNOW LIKE WHEN YOU SAID
YOU HAD THOSE FEELINGS FOR ME,

1:26:01.072 --> 1:26:07.035
LIKE, IF YOU WERE WITH ME,
EVERYTHING WOULD BE OKAY?

1:26:07.078 --> 1:26:08.370
YEAH.

1:26:08.454 --> 1:26:12.916
NOW...
IT'S THE REVERSE.

1:26:15.378 --> 1:26:17.963
IT'S THE REVERSE.

1:26:18.047 --> 1:26:22.551
WE WERE JUST
20 YEARS TOO LATE.

1:26:22.593 --> 1:26:25.220
(chuckles)

1:26:25.304 --> 1:26:27.431
(sighs)

1:27:30.787 --> 1:27:34.623
GOD, YOU'RE SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL GIRL, LAURA.

1:27:51.057 --> 1:27:54.810
(children chattering)

1:27:57.855 --> 1:28:02.484
WE SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE.

1:28:02.568 --> 1:28:04.027
YEAH.

1:28:19.502 --> 1:28:22.420
OH, THIS BITES.
WHY DO I HAVE
TO BE HERE, ANYWAY?

1:28:22.505 --> 1:28:25.257
BECAUSE HE'S YOUR COUSIN
AND HE WENT TO YOUR
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

1:28:25.341 --> 1:28:27.092
THAT'S 'CAUSE
YOU INVITED HIM.

1:28:27.176 --> 1:28:30.178
I DON'T KNOW ANY KIDS HERE, MOM.
THEY ALL GO TO HIS SCHOOL.

1:28:30.221 --> 1:28:32.430
WELL, I HAVE ERRANDS,
SO YOU'RE HERE.

1:28:32.515 --> 1:28:36.059
DEAL WITH IT.
I'LL SEE YOU AT 5:00.

1:28:38.563 --> 1:28:40.105
UGH.

1:28:51.868 --> 1:28:54.202
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1:28:55.413 --> 1:28:56.037
I NEED GAS.

1:28:56.080 --> 1:29:00.292
I'VE BEEN BELOW "E"
SINCE YESTERDAY.
I'LL NEVER MAKE IT HOME.

1:29:00.376 --> 1:29:01.626
YOU WANT ME TO PULL OVER
AND WAIT?

1:29:01.711 --> 1:29:06.965
NO, JUST GO ON TO MY HOUSE.
I'LL BE TWO MINUTES BEHIND YOU.

1:29:07.049 --> 1:29:08.300
(horn honks)

1:29:08.384 --> 1:29:09.801
OKAY.

1:29:19.896 --> 1:29:21.563
LAURA?

1:29:22.940 --> 1:29:24.149
HI.

1:29:24.233 --> 1:29:26.651
NANCY FELDMAN.

1:29:26.736 --> 1:29:27.569
HI.

1:29:27.612 --> 1:29:28.570
SETH FELDMAN'S MOTHER.

1:29:28.613 --> 1:29:32.324
OUR SONS WERE IN THE SAME GROUP
AT DAY CAMP THIS SUMMER.

1:29:32.408 --> 1:29:34.409
OH, RIGHT! HI, HI.

1:29:34.493 --> 1:29:35.660
HI.

1:29:35.745 --> 1:29:39.915
SO, HOW YA BEEN DOING?

1:29:39.999 --> 1:29:40.832
OH, OKAY.

1:29:40.917 --> 1:29:46.755
LAURA, I WAS SO SHOCKED
WHEN SETH CAME HOME FROM CAMP
THAT DAY

1:29:46.797 --> 1:29:51.009
AND TOLD ME THAT DENNIS' FATHER
HAD, YOU KNOW...

1:29:51.093 --> 1:29:53.011
DIED. YEAH.

1:29:53.095 --> 1:29:54.763
HEART ATTACK, RIGHT?

1:29:54.847 --> 1:29:56.598
ARRHYTHMIA.

1:29:56.682 --> 1:29:58.350
I'M SO SORRY.

1:29:58.434 --> 1:30:01.102
HOW'S DENNIS DEALING WITH IT?

1:30:01.187 --> 1:30:02.103
HE'S OKAY.

1:30:02.188 --> 1:30:03.939
HE'S AT NEWBURY FRIENDS
THIS YEAR.

1:30:04.023 --> 1:30:05.357
IT'S BEEN GOOD FOR HIM.

1:30:05.441 --> 1:30:06.107
OH, NEWBURY FRIENDS?

1:30:06.192 --> 1:30:09.694
MY HUSBAND'S COUSIN'S SON
GOES THERE... ADAM WALTON.

1:30:09.779 --> 1:30:14.115
IN FACT, I JUST DROPPED
SETH OFF AT HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY.

1:30:14.200 --> 1:30:17.285
OH, YEAH, DENNIS IS THERE.
HE'S AT THE PARTY.

1:30:17.370 --> 1:30:18.203
HE IS? (laughs)

1:30:18.287 --> 1:30:23.625
WHAT A SMALL WORLD!
IS THAT FUNNY?
IS THAT FUNNY?

1:30:23.709 --> 1:30:26.044
YES, IT IS. IT IS FUNNY.

1:30:26.128 --> 1:30:28.046
OH, IN FACT,
IT'S ACTUALLY A GODSEND

1:30:28.130 --> 1:30:29.464
BECAUSE SETH DIDN'T KNOW
ANY OTHER KIDS THERE.

1:30:29.548 --> 1:30:35.053
AND I'M SURE THAT DENNIS
WILL BE SURPRISED TO SEE ONE
OF HIS CAMP FRIENDS, HUH?

1:30:35.137 --> 1:30:37.973
YES, HE...

1:30:38.057 --> 1:30:40.725
OH MY GOD.

1:30:40.810 --> 1:30:42.143
OH, MY GOD. OH, GOD.

1:30:42.186 --> 1:30:43.979
WHAT? ARE YOU OKAY?

1:30:44.063 --> 1:30:46.189
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.

1:31:08.921 --> 1:31:12.507
(horn honks)

1:31:47.376 --> 1:31:50.962
HEY, I KNOW THAT KID.
I WENT TO CAMP WITH HIM.

1:31:51.047 --> 1:31:53.131
WHAT'S WITH THE TATTOO?

1:31:53.215 --> 1:31:55.216
HIS FATHER DIED IN 9/11.

1:31:55.301 --> 1:31:59.804
HUH? WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?

1:31:59.889 --> 1:32:02.557
(engine sputtering)

1:32:06.228 --> 1:32:11.816
OH, MY GOD.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.
COME ON! COME ON!

1:32:11.901 --> 1:32:13.735
(screams)

1:32:16.906 --> 1:32:19.407
(panting)

1:32:44.016 --> 1:32:47.102
THERE SHE IS...

1:32:47.186 --> 1:32:51.439
I HAVE HIM WAITING
FOR YOU OVER THERE.

1:32:56.612 --> 1:32:58.780
DISGRACEFUL...

1:33:05.663 --> 1:33:08.123
(crying)

1:33:23.681 --> 1:33:27.142
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1:33:27.226 --> 1:33:29.644
OH.

1:33:29.687 --> 1:33:34.566
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1:33:34.650 --> 1:33:41.656
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1:33:41.699 --> 1:33:48.663
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1:33:49.498 --> 1:33:51.666
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

(sighs)

1:37:00.606 --> 1:37:02.857
GONE IN THE BREEZE.

1:37:02.941 --> 1:37:09.030

OH, GOD, SUCH A BEAUTY.

1:37:09.073 --> 1:37:10.531
(both chuckle)

1:37:10.616 --> 1:37:12.533

1:37:12.618 --> 1:37:15.036
DON'T TELL HER I SAID SO.

1:37:15.079 --> 1:37:17.038
YOU'VE TOLD HER...
MANY TIMES.

1:37:17.081 --> 1:37:20.958
YEAH, YEAH, BUT ALWAYS
WHILE I WAS COMPLIMENTING HER
ON SOMETHING ELSE,

1:37:21.043 --> 1:37:24.045
LIKE HER
ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS.

1:37:24.088 --> 1:37:25.713
(both chuckle)

1:37:25.756 --> 1:37:29.217
WHICH ARE FIRST-RATE,

1:37:32.388 --> 1:37:37.308
YOU WERE ALWAYS
MY PRIDE AND JOY.

1:37:37.393 --> 1:37:38.059
SUCH A FREE SPIRIT.

1:37:38.143 --> 1:37:43.398
I DON'T THINK YOUR MOM OR KATH
EVER REALLY APPRECIATED
THAT ABOUT YOU.

1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:45.233
BUT YOU DID.

1:37:45.317 --> 1:37:47.485
YEAH, SURE.

1:37:47.569 --> 1:37:52.740
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU
STICK UP FOR ME MORE?

1:37:55.244 --> 1:37:58.496
HEY, LOOK AT THIS...
THAT'S ME AND TOM SEAVER,

1:37:58.580 --> 1:38:00.998
RIGHT AFTER THE METS
WON THE '69 SERIES,

1:38:01.083 --> 1:38:02.250
AND SEAVER'S
POURING CHAMPAGNE ON ME.

1:38:02.334 --> 1:38:07.422
NO, LOOK, 'CAUSE PAUL IS ALWAYS
SAYING HOW SEAVER WAS POURING
CHAMPAGNE ON HOWARD COSELL,

1:38:07.506 --> 1:38:12.760
BUT LOOK, LOOK HOW WET
MY SPORT JACKET IS, HUH?

1:38:12.803 --> 1:38:17.849
THE POINT IS, SWEETIE,
I WAS THERE.

1:38:17.933 --> 1:38:22.687
I GOT MY STORY.
FRONT PAGE.

1:38:22.771 --> 1:38:23.938
I KNOW.

1:38:23.981 --> 1:38:27.525
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
THE SPORTS SECTION,
I MEAN THE WHOLE PAPER.

1:38:27.609 --> 1:38:28.359
I KNOW.

1:38:28.444 --> 1:38:31.195
HONEY, LISTEN TO ME,
NOBODY HANDED THAT TO ME.

1:38:31.280 --> 1:38:32.864
'CAUSE WHEN ALL
IS SAID AND DONE,

1:38:32.948 --> 1:38:37.368
EVERYBODY HAS TO MAKE
THEIR OWN WAY THROUGH.

1:38:37.453 --> 1:38:39.704
I DON'T KNOW.

1:38:39.788 --> 1:38:42.790
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

1:38:44.460 --> 1:38:45.710

1:38:45.794 --> 1:38:47.128
I LOVE YOU, DADDY.

1:38:53.510 --> 1:38:55.052
I DON'T KNOW.

1:38:55.137 --> 1:39:01.309

HE HAD TO GO FOR A WALK.

1:39:01.393 --> 1:39:05.313

1:39:29.546 --> 1:39:32.006

1:39:35.511 --> 1:39:36.677
(chuckles)

1:39:36.762 --> 1:39:37.512
I CAN'T.

1:39:37.596 --> 1:39:41.182
I JUST TAUGHT MYSELF
THIS ONE RIFF WHEN I WAS
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

1:39:41.225 --> 1:39:44.685
SO PEOPLE WOULD GO, "HEY, MAN,
YOU'RE GOOD, KEEP PLAYING,"

1:39:44.728 --> 1:39:50.691
AT WHICH POINT I WOULD DECLINE,
APPEARING TO BE ADMIRABLY HUMBLE
ABOUT MY MUSICAL GIFT.

1:39:50.776 --> 1:39:52.777
DID IT WORK?

1:39:52.861 --> 1:39:55.530
I NEVER HAD THE GUTS
TO ACTUALLY TRY IT.

1:39:55.572 --> 1:39:59.534
THIS WAS MY FIRST CHANCE,
AND I BLEW IT.

1:39:59.576 --> 1:40:02.036
SO THERE YOU GO.

1:40:06.041 --> 1:40:07.875
I KNEW YOU WEREN'T
GONNA SHOW UP, LAURA.

1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:10.378
- I'M SO SORRY, PAUL.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

1:40:10.462 --> 1:40:11.212
DON'T APOLOGIZE.

1:40:11.255 --> 1:40:18.052
IT'S FUNNY, I HAD THIS FEELING
AS SOON AS I PULLED AWAY
FROM THE GAS STATION.

1:40:18.136 --> 1:40:20.555
LIKE IT WAS INEVITABLE.

1:40:20.639 --> 1:40:21.973
