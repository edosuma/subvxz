Odysseus is strangling the life out of us
to provoke a reaction.

00:09.320 --> 00:13.200
PRIAM: I've no option but to impose
rationing on the whole city.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.840
HECTOR: If we can dig from both sides,
in two months

00:17.080 --> 00:18.593
we'll have a supply line from the sea.

00:19.240 --> 00:20.071

00:20.720 --> 00:21.710
HELEN:
Fortified wine.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.038
It worked when I was trying to conceive.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.549
ODYSSEUS:
The king sacrificed his own daughter

00:27.840 --> 00:29.558
to appease the gods in coming here.

Where's your Trojan prince now? Hm?

00:33.560 --> 00:36.313
Gone to seek help from some loyal ally?

00:44.200 --> 00:47.556
Make sure he never gets back to the city.

00:48.840 --> 00:49.796
ACHILLES: Cilicia.

like a different place.

06:21.600 --> 06:22.476
We're still at war.

06:23.680 --> 06:24.750
But we're fighting.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.874
A supply line will bring hope

06:26.960 --> 06:29.110
prove to our people that
whatever the Greeks do...

06:30.520 --> 06:31.794
Troy won't be defeated.

06:39.720 --> 06:41.313
You are the one who's made that happen.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.151
Sir.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.638
I came through the tunnels...
from Cilicia.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.551
What happened?

07:48.240 --> 07:50.754
DOLON:
The Greeks. A surprise attack.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.235
Set the fields alight...

07:53.680 --> 07:54.795
Destroyed the supplies.

Well clone, Achilles.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.517
We are fortunate to have you on our side.

09:48.520 --> 09:49.840
You're not her.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.634
She's the priest's daughter.

09:56.120 --> 09:56.951
She's mine.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.073
But sir...
<i>—</i> I said, she's mine.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.111
AENEAS: The Greeks never came near
the tunnel entrance.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.396
It's possible they didn't even know
about the ration supply.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.279
It doesn't matter. We can't allow
an open route into the city.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.991
We need to shut the tunnels down.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.594
DEIPHOBUS:
Father, they're our only way out.

10:29.680 --> 10:32.433
Do you want what happened to Cilicia
to happen to us?

10:32.760 --> 10:35.593
Fill them in. Now.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.189
If Cilicia was attacked
because they helped us

10:43.280 --> 10:45.351
then we're the reason
those people are dead.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.437
PRIAM:
Eetion chose to lend us aid.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.990
It was a decision he made willingly,
with knowledge of the dangers.

10:51.800 --> 10:55.156
No.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.831
HECUBA:
Cities are lost in war.

12:14.720 --> 12:15.790
This isn't your fault.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.153
I helped dig the tunnels.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.873
I brokered the alliance.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.759
Who else does it fall on?

12:34.440 --> 12:35.271
Paris.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.599
He said it was Achilles.

12:43.160 --> 12:43.991
What?

12:46.440 --> 12:47.316
The messenger.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.758
He said that Achilles led the attack
and murdered Eetion.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.592
I swear on the gods

12:54.280 --> 12:57.716
if I ever meet him in battle,
I'll tear him apart.

13:24.480 --> 13:25.914
ACHILLES:
That wound will fester.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.195
You should use the ointment.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.953
I'm sorry you lost your home.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.230
War is war.

13:41.920 --> 13:42.955
Cities fall.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.036
But I didn't bring you here
because I wanted a slave.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.629

14:15.760 --> 14:17.637

14:23.800 --> 14:25.552
I know that you don't trust us here

14:26.200 --> 14:28.510
but the man behind me
chose you for his own.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.913
That makes you safer than any man or woman
in this camp.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.070
See?

14:44.200 --> 14:45.759
All it takes is...

14:50.120 --> 14:52.794
Cut me free or I kill him.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.278
ACHILLES:
I spared you once.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.751
I don't like repeating myself.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.350
Your choice.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.595
Don't fear me.

Do you ever think
you'd make it there alive?

16:21.280 --> 16:23.078
I'm a woman in mourning,
they'd let me through.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.476
Then let me go with you.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.520
But you need to give me time
to plan safe passage.

16:32.360 --> 16:33.430
It has to be now.

16:36.640 --> 16:37.550
You're sweating.

I'm fine.

Go. Now.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.349
Why didn't you tell me?

17:03.080 --> 17:04.309
You would have never let me go.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.151
My love.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.030
We will tell our child

17:11.960 --> 17:13.314
that their grandfather was good

17:14.079 --> 17:16.070
and strong, and he would have
loved them deeply.

17:17.480 --> 17:18.800
But now it's up to us to live.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.596
For his grandchild.

17:26.640 --> 17:27.835
ANDROMACHE SOBS

17:29.320 --> 17:31.755
So nothing I offer you will please you?

17:37.920 --> 17:39.433
I had no choice, you know.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.273
The gods gave me no choice.

17:48.080 --> 17:48.911
We should toast.

17:50.720 --> 17:51.710
This was our favourite.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.591
I forbade her to drink more than a goblet,
but she always disobeyed.

18:00.920 --> 18:01.751
She knew.

18:04.480 --> 18:05.470
She knew...

18:06.760 --> 18:07.591
I had to do it.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.759
And she forgave her father
for doing what had to be done.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.229
Do you forgive this?

18:32.560 --> 18:34.358
You do not deserve forgiveness.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.513
And I thank the gods
that you are no father of mine.

What would you do...

21:35.760 --> 21:38.070
if you were told that someone close to you
was dangerous?

21:39.360 --> 21:40.794
The cause of terrible things.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.069
And this person...

21:44.960 --> 21:46.075
do they seem violent?

21:46.960 --> 21:47.791
Evil?

21:48.480 --> 21:49.356
No.

21:49.400 --> 21:52.074
In fact, you'd only really seen them
trying to do right.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.637
I would say I was being led
to distrust someone who didn't deserve it.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.313
This war will test us, Hector.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.872
The years will drag,
our rations will shrink

22:16.200 --> 22:17.599

22:20.080 --> 22:21.912
The city needs us to stand strong.

We can't afford to lose...

23:37.480 --> 23:38.879
HECTOR:
Then I'll give up my own.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.510
It's a small price for a man's soul.
<i>—</i> No.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.555
If it was you,
I would do anything I could.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.795
PARIS:
What's going on?

23:51.160 --> 23:54.915
Andromache believes that no one
has performed her father's funeral rites.

23:56.440 --> 24:01.310
Your brother wants to hold a ceremony here
to permit Eetion safe passage into Elysium.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.350
But Eetion's body...
<i>—</i> Is inaccessible.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.032
We'd have to offer a holy vessel
in his place.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.398
A vessel?
<i>—</i> A horse.

24:33.760 --> 24:34.795
Are you sure about this?

24:36.760 --> 24:38.956
You make sacrifices
for the people you love.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.559
Even if it makes you hate yourself.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.753
THERSITES:
Got here last night.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.593
Don't move, just stand there

25:02.640 --> 25:03.471
watching us.

25:05.480 --> 25:06.311
We should gut them.

25:07.800 --> 25:08.835
That's a good idea.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.755
You might replace Agamemnon
as Apollo's favourite.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.313
SOLDIER 1: Go on, hurry up!
<i>—</i> SOLDIER 2: Over here.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.031
That's my father.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.673
Here to fight for your return.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.516
He doesn't need to.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.555
The sickness takes our thirst.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.158
This is Apollo's wrath.

26:09.120 --> 26:09.951
Indeed.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.679
Your leader violated
his priest's daughter.

26:15.280 --> 26:19.114
A single king has the power
to damn the nation.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.199
ACHILLES:
Patroclus.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.196
You need to rest.

26:35.840 --> 26:36.910
More came in this morning.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.914
A few more weeks and the sick
will outnumber the healthy.

26:44.360 --> 26:46.351
We came here to fight Menelaus's cause

26:48.200 --> 26:50.999
and now we die because his brother
won't give up his plaything.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.149
Is this honour?

26:56.920 --> 26:58.593
Is this what it means to be a warrior?

26:58.680 --> 27:01.559
We came here because a Trojan
disgraced a Greek king.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.474
We're loyal to Agamemnon.

27:07.680 --> 27:10.672
You shouldn't let the sickness
make us forget that.

27:13.160 --> 27:13.991
You alright?

27:21.640 --> 27:27.636
INDISTINCT MURMURS

27:29.040 --> 27:30.678
DOORS OPEN

27:34.440 --> 27:37.558
SOUND OF HOOVES

27:43.440 --> 27:45.272
HORSE NEIGHS

28:14.080 --> 28:15.753
HORSE SNORTS

28:35.080 --> 28:38.152
HORSE SQUEALS

28:39.080 --> 28:41.879
QUICK THUDDING OF HOOVES

28:44.520 --> 28:46.557
THUD

28:53.880 --> 28:55.075
May you cross over, Father.

29:02.440 --> 29:03.271
Is it enough?

29:04.560 --> 29:05.391
It is.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.039
You did a good thing.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.316
I can't unsee it, madam.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.235
SHE GASPS

30:03.880 --> 30:04.870
Sorry.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.477
My town was hit with a plague like this.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.830
My mother taught me a remedy
to slow the sickness.

30:27.320 --> 30:28.310
He was kind to me.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.594
What happened with the plague?

30:43.800 --> 30:44.631
People died.

30:45.720 --> 30:46.994
My parents included.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.957
It passed in the end,
but this is different.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.439
Agamemnon has slighted Apollo.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.636
The sickness won't lift
until Chriseis is return.

30:59.240 --> 31:00.594
CHOKING SOUNDS

31:03.960 --> 31:05.394
He's bleeding from the inside.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.231
What the hell are...
<i>—</i> Men are dying out there.

31:21.320 --> 31:22.469
My man is dying.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.791
All because you won't give back
your new toy.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.874
Get out...
<i>—</i> Give her back.

31:35.120 --> 31:35.951
Or I will.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.680
I can't be the only one thinking
they acted on inside knowledge.

31:42.440 --> 31:43.874
That's a dangerous accusation.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.031
Forgive me, madam,
but it's also a valid theory.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.076
The tunnels were a confidential operation.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.878
Cilicia was our greatest ally.

31:50.960 --> 31:53.395
There are a hundred reasons
why the Greeks would have wanted it gone

31:53.480 --> 31:54.879
none of which involve treachery.

31:55.360 --> 31:57.920
But can we really just dismiss this
as coincidence?

31:58.160 --> 32:00.549
If there's even a chance
someone here gave Cilicia up...

32:01.880 --> 32:04.110
We owe it to the dead to find out.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.275
PANDARUS:
We can work quietly.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.271
Interview everyone
who knew about the tunnels.

32:15.040 --> 32:18.396
At least eliminate the possibility
of a traitor inside Troy.

32:24.200 --> 32:25.713
HELEN:
But our people are loyal.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.360
Why treat them like suspects
when the city is in recovery?

32:28.440 --> 32:30.590
I don't believe that Cilicia
was a chance attack.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.751
The Greeks must have known
what it meant to us.

32:32.840 --> 32:35.753
Even if they did, it doesn't mean
they learnt that from a Trojan.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.474
Paris, all of this will only cause
Andromache more pain.

32:38.560 --> 32:39.789
And if there is a traitor...

32:42.200 --> 32:44.840
how do you think she'll feel seeing them
get what they deserve?

33:13.640 --> 33:15.119
NESTOR:
Let the gods bear witness.

33:16.120 --> 33:19.033
We hereby return the daughter of Apollo
to her rightful temple.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.277
And relinquish all hold upon her.

33:43.160 --> 33:44.434
Chriseis.
<i>—</i> Father!

34:02.360 --> 34:03.714
SOLDIER YELLS ORDERS

34:22.239 --> 34:26.120
BIRD CAWS

34:28.679 --> 34:29.875
ODYSSEUS:
Must be agonising

34:30.400 --> 34:33.710
seeing those from home
and not being able to go back with them.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.315
Only Cilicia was never really
your home, was it?

34:40.719 --> 34:42.199
The mark of a Trojan exile.

34:44.440 --> 34:45.271
<i>You're Utes.</i>

34:46.719 --> 34:47.755
Priam's High Priest.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.231
Once.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.435
Why would a king banish his gateway
to the gods?

34:57.360 --> 34:58.191
You saw something...

35:00.240 --> 35:02.038
knew something he didn't want getting out.

35:03.360 --> 35:06.637
The gods gave you power
to guide the future of men

35:08.160 --> 35:09.434
yet you huddle in silence.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.069
I serve the gods

35:12.680 --> 35:13.511
in my own way.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.955
You do Priam's bidding.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.235
I tried...

35:18.640 --> 35:19.994
to prevent the swarm.

35:20.840 --> 35:21.671
He wouldn't listen.

35:22.920 --> 35:23.751
Look around.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.079
The earth is soaked

35:28.920 --> 35:31.309
with Greek and Trojan blood.

35:33.400 --> 35:36.950
If the gods granted you knowledge
to tip the scales

35:37.720 --> 35:39.358
they intended you to use it.

35:47.880 --> 35:48.711
What do you know?

36:05.040 --> 36:07.475
XANTHIUS: I thought we were done
with all these questions.

36:08.080 --> 36:08.990
HARMON: Yes, well...

36:09.920 --> 36:11.752
I suppose they're on edge after Cilicia.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.515
Still, the idea of a spy inside the city

36:15.400 --> 36:16.231
it's unthinkable.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.433
Aren't you one of the royal servants?

36:20.400 --> 36:21.390
I saw you at the funeral.

36:23.040 --> 36:23.871
Excuse me.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.510
MAID:
Madam, shall I prepare your bath?

36:45.800 --> 36:47.518
I think I prefer to be alone tonight.

36:53.320 --> 36:54.151
Actually...

36:55.480 --> 36:57.198
there is one more thing
you could do for me.

37:15.280 --> 37:16.111
KNOCK AT DOOR

37:36.200 --> 37:37.031
What are you doing?

37:39.000 --> 37:41.037
I was breaking into
tomorrow's wine ration.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.359
Haven't seen you do this for a while.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.596
We've questioned everyone involved
in the tunnels.

37:54.120 --> 37:56.350
No one knows anything
that might point to treachery.

37:57.680 --> 37:58.795
That's a good thing, isn't it?

38:00.360 --> 38:02.078
I just wanted some kind of justice.

38:04.280 --> 38:06.032
You wanted someone to blame.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.189
Someone else.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.750
Anyone who dies in this war
is because I started it.

38:17.320 --> 38:18.151
Alexander.

38:19.680 --> 38:20.875
We fight with you

38:21.960 --> 38:22.916
not because of you.

38:25.960 --> 38:26.950
We are family.

38:28.960 --> 38:29.916
We stand together.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.549
That's how we're going to win.

38:38.240 --> 38:39.594
They've been asking questions.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.039
Soldiers from the palace.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.393
Have you told them anything?

38:50.520 --> 38:51.351
Not yet.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.474
I was Achilles's target.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.793
When he walked out of my chamber

38:59.840 --> 39:02.514
I never thought there'd be consequences
for anyone else.

39:06.480 --> 39:07.470
I know...

39:09.040 --> 39:10.314
how much I'm asking of you.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.712
We don't have to be on opposing sides.

39:42.520 --> 39:44.113
I hope you'll remain in our employ.

39:46.400 --> 39:47.674
You're a loyal servant.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.556
FIGHTING GRUNTS

40:04.040 --> 40:05.553
ACHILLES:
You're getting stronger.

40:06.480 --> 40:07.470
PATROCLUS:
And you're holding back.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.039
FIGHTING GRUNTS

40:09.120 --> 40:10.349
You almost died, Patroclus.

40:10.440 --> 40:11.350
PATROCLUS CRIES OUT

40:12.640 --> 40:15.075
ACHILLES:
I'm hardly going to beat you bloody.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.713
PATROCLUS:
As if you could.

40:17.400 --> 40:18.913
PATROCLUS SHOUTS OUT
— ACHILLES LAUGHS

40:24.040 --> 40:24.871
I told you.

40:25.920 --> 40:26.751
PATROCLUS GRUNTS

40:31.760 --> 40:32.750
ACHILLES LAUGHS

41:05.800 --> 41:07.518
You seem better.
<i>—</i> I am.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.956
Achilles told me you looked after me
when I was sick.

41:12.160 --> 41:12.991
Thank you.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.200
I'm glad you didn't die.

42:39.680 --> 42:40.715
Where have you been?

42:50.960 --> 42:51.995
You've been drinking.

42:57.000 --> 42:57.990
I needed to.

43:04.920 --> 43:05.751
What happened...

43:07.200 --> 43:08.190
with the interviews?

43:08.280 --> 43:09.315
PARIS SIGHS

43:10.760 --> 43:11.591
You were right.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.398
We're not about to unearth a traitor.

43:35.600 --> 43:36.510
I love you.

43:42.040 --> 43:43.633
What are you doing out here?

43:43.760 --> 43:44.909
Are the Greeks going to win?

43:46.480 --> 43:47.470
XANTHIUS SIGHS

43:48.560 --> 43:49.550
They burnt Cilicia.

43:51.160 --> 43:52.150
They could burn us, too.

43:54.080 --> 43:55.354
I don't want Troy to lose.

43:58.600 --> 43:59.431
Come with me.

44:08.240 --> 44:09.833
Close your eyes.
<i>—</i> What?

44:09.920 --> 44:10.830
Just do it.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.713
I want you to picture the Trojan shore.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.231
The way the sand melts from light to dark.

44:19.520 --> 44:21.079
Now imagine you're flying over it.

44:22.280 --> 44:25.477
Across the great plain of wild flowers,
spread out like patchwork

44:26.040 --> 44:26.871
under the sun.

44:28.680 --> 44:30.034
You're heading for the walls.

44:31.040 --> 44:33.475
Those great gates
stretching towards the sky...

44:35.200 --> 44:36.315
over the threshold...

44:37.240 --> 44:38.150
now you're inside.

44:39.160 --> 44:39.991
Across the streets

44:40.960 --> 44:43.190
soaring across the citadel
towards the palace.

44:45.200 --> 44:46.031
You see it?

44:47.280 --> 44:48.395
I see it.
<i>—</i> Good.

44:49.600 --> 44:50.431
Open your eyes.

44:52.880 --> 44:54.917
However this war ends,
you close your eyes

44:56.480 --> 44:57.550
Troy will always be there.

45:00.120 --> 45:00.951
OK?

45:14.280 --> 45:15.509
DOG WHIMPERS

45:45.840 --> 45:47.194
AGAMEMNON:
Achilles!

45:54.560 --> 45:55.550
Achilles!

46:28.280 --> 46:29.350
How's Patroclus?

46:30.640 --> 46:31.675
Doing better.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.075
AGAMEMNON:
Good news.

46:35.200 --> 46:36.474
Patroclus recovers...

46:37.240 --> 46:38.913
Achilles gets his best man back...

46:39.880 --> 46:40.870
All is well.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.959
Yet here stands Agamemnon

46:44.840 --> 46:46.911
stripped of his prize
in front of his men

46:48.320 --> 46:50.231
forced to do the bidding of an inferior.

46:50.840 --> 46:52.160
Brother...
<i>—</i> AGAMEMNON: Silence!

46:52.960 --> 46:53.950
I am king here.

46:54.480 --> 46:55.754
You are my warrior.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.679
I never pretended to be anything
than what I am.

46:59.920 --> 47:01.274
Good. Then you will understand.

47:02.320 --> 47:06.075
Since I was forced to give up something
precious at your demand...

47:08.000 --> 47:09.638
you will return the favour.

47:12.160 --> 47:13.275
I want her.

47:19.200 --> 47:20.793
ACHILLES:
The Trojans never wronged me.

47:22.520 --> 47:23.840
I came here for you.

47:25.960 --> 47:27.871
I slay men by the day for you.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.674
And now you intend to take my woman

47:33.960 --> 47:36.395
so you can feel like a ruler again.

47:40.760 --> 47:41.830
Take her.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.435
But do that

47:47.120 --> 47:49.191
and I withdraw from the fighting forever.

47:57.080 --> 47:57.911
Agamemnon.

48:00.720 --> 48:02.518
We need him.
<i>—</i> Silence.

48:19.840 --> 48:21.956
This war does not rely on you to win it.

48:24.800 --> 48:25.631
Achilles.

48:28.640 --> 48:30.313
You are nothing without me.

48:39.000 --> 48:39.990
BRISEIS STRUGGLES

48:40.440 --> 48:41.475
Agamemnon!

48:42.840 --> 48:44.069
BRISEIS CRIES OUT

48:49.040 --> 48:50.314
You fight alone now.

49:07.800 --> 49:08.915
We're fucked!

49:10.840 --> 49:11.671
Shut your mouth.

49:11.760 --> 49:13.797
THERSITES:
Come on, Ajax. We're all thinking it.

49:13.920 --> 49:17.197
Agamemnon's tumbled off the sanity cliff
and Achilles isn't fighting.

49:17.360 --> 49:20.239
I'd say we were all halfway to Hades.
<i>—</i> AJAX YELLS

49:20.320 --> 49:21.196
MANI Hey!

49:22.480 --> 49:24.073
MENELAUS:
What are you going to do now?

49:50.480 --> 49:51.390
What?

49:52.280 --> 49:53.350
The Greeks.

49:54.360 --> 49:55.759
They're proposing a duel.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.518
Single combat to decide the war.

49:59.440 --> 50:01.670
Who would you fight?
<i>—</i> Not me. You.

50:03.160 --> 50:04.230
Menelaus.

50:05.040 --> 50:06.189
It's a trick.

50:06.880 --> 50:10.350
Menelaus would never put himself at risk
unless he was certain he could win.

50:10.400 --> 50:12.232
They've asked us to dictate the terms.

50:13.320 --> 50:14.913
We can enforce code of honour.

50:15.000 --> 50:15.831
Where?

50:16.240 --> 50:17.389
Outside the walls.

50:18.280 --> 50:20.794
We'd assemble archers to protect you
and I'd be your second.

50:21.920 --> 50:23.194
You're faster than Menelaus.

50:24.760 --> 50:26.717
You could win the war, Alexander.

50:28.000 --> 50:28.956
You really believe that?

50:29.760 --> 50:31.034
I believe in you.

50:34.160 --> 50:35.833
It's his decision, Hecuba.

50:40.320 --> 50:41.435
He wants to fight.

50:43.800 --> 50:45.029
He believes he can win.

50:52.080 --> 50:53.229
'Have faith,' you said.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.673
PARIS:
I'm coming back.

51:01.400 --> 51:02.674
How can you be so sure?

51:05.080 --> 51:05.990
I just am.

51:08.280 --> 51:09.839
Like when I first saw you on Sparta.

51:12.680 --> 51:14.159
I knew I couldn't leave without you.

51:16.960 --> 51:18.314
That wasn't life or death.

51:19.480 --> 51:21.517
Yes, it was.

51:26.120 --> 51:27.440
I know Menelaus.

51:28.720 --> 51:29.710
He'll have something.

51:32.080 --> 51:33.195
So do I.

51:35.200 --> 51:36.634
Something he'll never have again.

52:52.920 --> 52:56.879
HORN SOUNDS

53:01.400 --> 53:03.994
FIGHTING GRUNTS

53:05.560 --> 53:06.550
Come on.

53:42.840 --> 53:44.239
MENELAUS CRIES OUT

53:47.680 --> 53:49.239
THEY SHOUT OUT

54:05.040 --> 54:06.951
You'd kill me, would you, boy?

54:08.200 --> 54:09.554
Become Troy's hero?

54:10.960 --> 54:12.997
There's someone you need to meet first.

54:22.320 --> 54:23.799
PARIS:
Who are you?

54:23.840 --> 54:25.478
I was Troy's High Priest.

54:26.480 --> 54:27.754
Your father banished me.

54:29.720 --> 54:30.994
PRIAM MURMURS

54:31.040 --> 54:32.394
Why?

54:33.040 --> 54:34.678
LITOS:
Because of what I know about you.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.196
Kill him. Now.

54:39.920 --> 54:42.070
I out the doves at your birth

54:42.120 --> 54:43.997
and the blood ran black.

54:52.520 --> 54:54.989
The gods have cursed you, Alexander.

54:55.760 --> 54:58.991
They place your life on the scales
and Troy on the other end.

55:03.160 --> 55:05.800
MENELAUS: You didn't think you
were taken by wolves...

55:06.280 --> 55:07.793
did you?

55:10.360 --> 55:11.509
What are you talking about?

55:13.320 --> 55:14.310
The prophecy-

55:21.160 --> 55:24.278
For Troy to live, you have to die.

55:41.720 --> 55:43.154
Your own family tried to kill you

55:43.200 --> 55:45.271
and now you bring them
nothing but death.

55:47.320 --> 55:49.436
PARIS CRIES OUT
<i>—</i> Make them stop!

55:51.200 --> 55:52.474
MENELAUS:
A curse on his family.

55:54.200 --> 55:55.599
A curse on his wife!

55:58.160 --> 55:59.992
A curse on the city he fights for.

56:16.040 --> 56:18.680
STEADY THUDDING STARTS

57:02.920 --> 57:04.479
APHRODITE:
<i>Run.</i>
