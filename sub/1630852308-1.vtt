WEBVTT

00:34.010 --> 00:39.010
-Are you going to jump? Do it!
-It's your turn!

00:39.050 --> 00:42.240
-Hang on a second.
-It's not even that high!

00:46.090 --> 00:50.100
-There's something in the water.
-Like what?

00:50.140 --> 00:53.070
-Excuses?
-Where?

00:53.110 --> 00:56.190
-Right there! I'm not joking!
-There's nothing there!

00:56.230 --> 01:00.040
-Oh, fuck!
-Jesus!

01:18.240 --> 01:20.210
-Oh my God.
-Yeah, it's nice.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.210
-It's incredible.
-Yeah.

01:26.210 --> 01:28.220
Would you like a cup of tea?

01:29.010 --> 01:33.060
I'm good, thanks.
My extra shift's about to start.

01:33.100 --> 01:36.070
I'll just sign the contract
and get on my way.

01:36.110 --> 01:39.120
-As long as the missus is happy?
-Very happy.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.230
Okay.

01:55.070 --> 01:59.000
-What's wrong?
-Nothing, it's just a lot of money.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.190
No need to worry.

02:00.230 --> 02:06.090
Buying property in the city center
is a safe investment. You'll be fine.

02:11.030 --> 02:14.080
-Sierra two-zero, over.
-Excuse me.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.200
Sierra two-zero.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.160
-Were you the one who called this in?
-Yes. They're over here.

02:30.200 --> 02:34.170
They just appeared in the water.
I have no idea where they came from.

02:34.210 --> 02:37.100
One of them almost drowned.

02:40.100 --> 02:45.120
Okay. Let's stay nice and calm,
all right? We're here to help you.

02:45.160 --> 02:48.070
Calm down.

02:48.110 --> 02:54.110
Here are some blankets,
so you can keep warm. Here you go.

02:54.150 --> 02:59.180
-I found someone who speaks Icelandic.
-But I've only got two minutes.

02:59.220 --> 03:03.100
It's better than nothing.
Do you understand them?

03:03.140 --> 03:06.220
Hi, my name is Sveinbjørn.
Where do you come from?

03:11.010 --> 03:13.120
Sorry, can you slow down a bit?

03:17.190 --> 03:19.070
Where are you from?

03:28.240 --> 03:32.130
-They're definitely not Icelandic.
-Really?

03:32.170 --> 03:37.020
They speak some sort of Old Norse.
I don't understand all of it.

03:37.060 --> 03:41.100
But they appear to think
that they're from the past.

03:43.060 --> 03:44.240
Okay.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.210
Hi. Put me through to psychiatric
emergency services, please.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.060
What can you tell us
about the situation?

04:09.100 --> 04:11.230
It is the same
as we've just seen...

04:13.010 --> 04:15.010
I'm still here.

04:18.100 --> 04:22.140
The lack of organization indicates
authorities were caught off guard.

04:22.180 --> 04:25.140
Are there any signs
of the numbers decreasing?

04:25.180 --> 04:29.010
We're trying to figure out
if this will end soon,

04:29.050 --> 04:33.000
or if we've only seen
the beginning of a global event.

04:33.040 --> 04:37.100
Thank you, Kelly.
Reports seem to confirm

04:37.140 --> 04:40.110
that this is happening
all over the world.

04:40.150 --> 04:46.070
There are no official explanations.
Unofficial observations on social media

04:46.110 --> 04:52.170
all point in the same direction:
That individuals from the past appear...

05:05.030 --> 05:07.060
Sierra two-zero to zero-one.

05:07.100 --> 05:11.210
Send all your men
to the opera house immediately. Over.

05:39.150 --> 05:43.110
A FEW YEARS LATER

05:46.180 --> 05:51.120
It's time for the arrival update.
How was the night?

05:51.160 --> 05:53.080
Nice and quiet.

05:53.120 --> 05:59.160
We had a group arrival this morning,
but it shouldn't affect boat traffic.

05:59.200 --> 06:04.100
The Directorate's annual report
is coming up.

06:04.140 --> 06:07.230
What can you say about the numbers?

06:08.020 --> 06:11.070
We have 13,000 arrivals so far
this year,

06:11.110 --> 06:15.040
which is about the same as last year.

06:15.080 --> 06:19.010
There is still no deviation
regarding time periods:

06:19.050 --> 06:22.240
All registered arrivals
are from the stone age,

06:23.030 --> 06:25.240
the Norse era and the 19th century,

06:40.120 --> 06:44.000
Thank you to Tore Stokke
from the Arrival Directorate.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.120
Dad?

06:45.160 --> 06:48.180
...a reminder that
international arrival numbers...

06:48.220 --> 06:52.080
-Hi. Ready?
-Yeah.

06:55.030 --> 06:58.050
It reeks of rotten fish
from the ventilation system.

06:58.090 --> 07:03.000
If you don't kick them out...
Hi. Yes, I will! What?

07:05.100 --> 07:06.200
What's wrong?

07:06.240 --> 07:10.160
The power outage knocked out
my hair dryer. Does my hair look crazy?

07:10.200 --> 07:12.210
No, I think it looks nice.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.040
-Very "Stone Age chic".
-You're hilarious, dad.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.050
Seriously...

07:31.190 --> 07:33.170
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY FOR RENT

07:39.000 --> 07:42.040
We interrupt
the High Commissioner's statement.

07:42.080 --> 07:47.120
It appears we've had another year
without findings from any member country

07:47.160 --> 07:51.140
that can shed light
on the reasons for the time migrations.

07:51.180 --> 07:56.080
There will now be news
for listeners from the 19th century.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.200
Good morning.

08:04.040 --> 08:07.050
-Speak soon.
-Yes. Bye, now.

08:11.090 --> 08:14.150
-Hi!
-There you are, sweetheart!

08:15.170 --> 08:19.180
-Hi, sweetie. Did you have a nice time?
-Yes.

08:20.140 --> 08:22.180
-Hi.
-Welcome!

08:25.060 --> 08:29.210
This is zero-one, we have a potential
DDA on Tjuvholmen, over.

08:31.090 --> 08:32.210
I'm on my way.

10:06.130 --> 10:10.210
A female beforeigner has washed ashore.
Let's call it "drowned" and go to lunch.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.110
That's all the information you need.

10:13.150 --> 10:16.050
Hi. Police. Were you
the one who found her?

10:16.090 --> 10:20.100
-Yes.
-Can you show us where she is, please?

10:20.140 --> 10:22.140
This is our twelfth floater this year.

10:22.180 --> 10:27.110
I don't see why we need to register them
before the ambulance picks them up.

10:27.150 --> 10:30.120
We've registered eleven,
we can handle one more.

11:15.140 --> 11:18.040
-Ready?
-Yes.

11:19.110 --> 11:23.160
Just leave your things there.
Oh, you dropped...

11:26.040 --> 11:29.200
-I'm not sure what this is.
-Thanks.

11:34.020 --> 11:36.020
-Let's do this.
-Okay.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.220
Today's a big day for our division.

11:39.010 --> 11:43.090
I'm proud to introduce you
to our first employee

11:43.130 --> 11:46.020
with a multi-temporal background.

11:46.060 --> 11:49.030
Please welcome Alvfrid Enginnsdottir.

11:49.070 --> 11:52.020
Alfhildr.

11:52.060 --> 11:56.100
Of course. "A beloved child
has many names", as they say.

11:56.140 --> 12:01.030
Anyway, I'm sure Alvilde's
extensive experience will provide us

12:01.070 --> 12:05.080
- with interesting perspectives.
-I am a certified police officer,

12:05.120 --> 12:09.080
- in case anyone was wondering.
-Of course.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.140
Anyway... There's cake!

12:15.010 --> 12:19.060
Is it just me, or is the ocean air
making you crave sushi?

12:21.080 --> 12:25.000
Let's get the form done
before we think about lunch.

12:28.150 --> 12:30.220
"Deceased During Arrival" or "Jumper"?

12:31.010 --> 12:36.030
Her hair and nails don't
appear to have been cut with scissors.

12:36.070 --> 12:38.060
These are bitten. DDA.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.100
Her tattoos look prehistoric.

12:42.140 --> 12:45.060
The log says there was a flash at 4 AM.

12:45.130 --> 12:48.120
That matches
the time she floated ashore.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.200
-Enter that as her TOA.
-Not bad, Poirot.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.200
"Cause of death" is drowning.
We submit the form

12:54.240 --> 12:58.060
and let the ambulance service take over.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.240
For fuck's sake, what's the matter?

13:39.060 --> 13:42.190
-Tango two-one to U05.
-U05 responds.

13:44.030 --> 13:47.130
DDA at Sørenga
with onlookers and possible trouble.

13:47.170 --> 13:50.170
-Requesting assistance.
-How much do you need?

13:50.210 --> 13:55.060
Forensics confirmed
that what I found were petechiae.

13:55.100 --> 13:58.230
Congrats. I guess I won't
make it to bridge tonight.

13:59.020 --> 14:04.210
But that doesn't necessarily rule out
drowning as the cause of death?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.070
There were petechiae
underneath her eyelids, too.

14:07.110 --> 14:12.070
Oh, Haaland...
You've made a right mess.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.190
We're done here.

14:16.230 --> 14:19.230
-Ah, the journalist's here.
-The journalist?

14:20.020 --> 14:23.230
She's from an online newspaper
for beforeigners.

14:24.020 --> 14:27.060
Just smile and say you're excited,
you'll be fine.

14:27.100 --> 14:31.140
I'm right outside the museum,
where a body was found earlier today.

14:31.180 --> 14:36.200
The police have blocked off the area,
and I've seen forensics on the scene.

14:36.240 --> 14:40.110
-Are we talking a murder here?
-It's too early to say.

14:40.150 --> 14:46.050
The police are secretive. I've covered
many cases with drowned beforeigners,

14:46.090 --> 14:49.080
and this is completely different.

14:53.150 --> 14:55.000
-Hi.
-Hey!

14:55.040 --> 15:00.010
-What's going on over there?
-The management has completely lost it.

15:00.050 --> 15:05.040
Our department's struggling, and
they go and hire a beforeigner mascot.

15:05.080 --> 15:09.040
The girl is straight out
of the Police Academy.

15:16.190 --> 15:21.060
-Great. And smile!
-Big day. Big day.

15:21.100 --> 15:27.020
How about one where I pick her up,
and she gives a big thumbs up?

15:27.060 --> 15:30.220
-That's fine, we've got what we need.
-Okay.

15:31.010 --> 15:34.000
What are your thoughts
on the beforeigner woman

15:34.040 --> 15:39.140
who was found murdered on Tjuvholmen?
Any indications of hate crime?

15:39.180 --> 15:42.010
Hate crime..?

15:42.050 --> 15:45.180
Where did you hear
that the woman was murdered?

15:45.220 --> 15:49.220
-Are you taking notes?
-You're not familiar with the case.

15:50.010 --> 15:54.240
Does that mean the police doesn't
prioritize murders on beforeigners?

15:55.030 --> 15:57.180
Of course not. Please stop writing.

15:57.220 --> 16:01.070
We agreed to an interview
with our new employee...

16:01.110 --> 16:03.230
I will write whatever I find useful.

16:04.020 --> 16:07.040
Honestly! A feel-good story
is a feel-good story.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.170
That's an unwritten rule
of media relations.

16:09.210 --> 16:12.240
Perhaps you're too inexperienced
to know that?

16:13.030 --> 16:18.070
I've been a journalist since the 1870s,
so I'm not completely green.

16:18.110 --> 16:22.020
Then you're old enough to understand
that this interview is over.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.050
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

16:28.010 --> 16:31.040
Harald? The Chief is waiting
in the conference room.

16:31.080 --> 16:35.020
She wants to see
you and Haaland immediately.

16:38.140 --> 16:40.150
-Hi, Harald.
-Hi.

16:40.190 --> 16:46.190
Hi, Lars. I hear the Tjuvholmen incident
hasn't been ruled a regular drowning.

16:46.230 --> 16:49.240
Turns out it's a bit more complicated.

16:50.030 --> 16:53.130
Forensics think
the cause of death is strangulation.

16:53.170 --> 16:55.200
That's not what we need now.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.220
We'll need a senior detective for this.
Who's available?

17:00.010 --> 17:04.080
No one, they're all threatening
to resign because of the workload.

17:04.120 --> 17:06.140
-I can do it.
-You?

17:06.180 --> 17:09.080
-I found her.
-You're on sick leave.

17:09.120 --> 17:14.110
Aren't you being reviewed
for chronic drowsiness or something?

17:14.150 --> 17:16.240
I'm trying out a new medication.

17:17.030 --> 17:21.230
-I'm ready to increase my workload.
-What kind of medication?

17:24.030 --> 17:28.230
I don't remember what it's called.
It's some natural remedy.

17:29.020 --> 17:33.190
Let me be clear: No one doubts
your competence as a police officer.

17:33.230 --> 17:36.170
-No?
-Our handling of beforeigner cases

17:36.210 --> 17:40.210
has been harshly criticized.
Putting someone on sick leave

17:41.000 --> 17:44.210
- in charge of a murder case...
-Despite my health issues...

17:45.000 --> 17:46.200
-I have an idea.

17:50.020 --> 17:54.030
What if we team Lars up
with our most recent addition?

17:54.070 --> 18:00.040
Of course! We'd be covered in terms
of communication and police expertise.

18:00.080 --> 18:04.020
The department mascot
in charge of a murder investigation?

18:04.060 --> 18:05.160
I thought
you were better than that.

18:05.200 --> 18:10.040
Look at her!
She's clearly not qualified.

18:15.090 --> 18:17.000
Where are we going?

18:17.040 --> 18:20.150
To the port police, to find
those who arrived with the victim.

18:20.190 --> 18:25.150
I never thought I'd be assigned
to a murder case on my first day.

18:25.190 --> 18:27.240
I'm a bit overwhelmed myself.

18:45.210 --> 18:47.180
Cool song.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.230
-Is it Bruce Springstones?
-Something like that.

18:59.150 --> 19:01.150
OPENING GROUP CALLED "B4"

19:01.190 --> 19:04.170
A new member joined the group:
TORFINN

19:20.040 --> 19:24.230
-Look who it is! Long time, no see.
-Yeah.

19:25.020 --> 19:28.170
-What's going on?
-My groin got scratched up.

19:28.210 --> 19:32.010
-Better safe than sorry.
-My God...

19:32.050 --> 19:37.080
-Were you two working last night?
-No, we clocked out at 11 PM. Why?

19:37.120 --> 19:40.230
A beforeigner woman, possibly murdered,
was found at Tjuvholmen.

19:41.020 --> 19:44.030
Was there a prehistoric woman
in the group last night?

19:44.070 --> 19:47.000
Not according to the report.

19:47.040 --> 19:52.050
They were dropped off at the transit
reception center. You could check there.

19:52.090 --> 19:57.030
-Who's this lovely lady?
Right. This is Alfhildr.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.210
-Jeppe and David.
-Alf..?

20:00.000 --> 20:03.090
-Alfhildr.
-Alfhildr? Is that Norse?

20:03.130 --> 20:08.130
-Yes. It's my first day.
-Let's go for a cup of mead someday.

20:08.170 --> 20:11.230
I'll give you some input.
About the job, that is.

20:12.020 --> 20:15.020
Sorry, Jeppe almost
had his knob torn off.

20:15.060 --> 20:17.070
Almost.

20:17.110 --> 20:21.130
Let me know if the guys from
last night's shift have any information.

20:21.170 --> 20:24.180
Think about that cup of mead, Alfhildur!

20:24.220 --> 20:28.200
-Alfhildr. Is it Alfhildur or Alfhildr?
-Alfhildr.

21:03.230 --> 21:05.170
Are you coming?

21:05.210 --> 21:11.010
I need the papers on the last arrival.
I need them quick, understand? Good.

21:11.050 --> 21:15.040
What do you think? Can you gather
the group that arrived last night?

21:15.080 --> 21:20.030
Well... It's not easy
to keep track of people these days.

21:20.070 --> 21:23.230
The arrivals affect our power systems,

21:24.020 --> 21:28.170
so we had to ditch the computers
and do things the old-fashioned way.

21:28.210 --> 21:32.170
Look at that!
The 28th, isn't that today?

21:32.210 --> 21:36.110
-Yes, it is.
-So there is a method to the madness.

22:29.190 --> 22:32.200
These came last night.
Some of them are Norse.

22:32.240 --> 22:37.110
-Do you need an interpreter?
-It's okay. I can translate.

22:38.190 --> 22:42.220
We need information about this woman.

22:43.010 --> 22:47.050
We believe she arrived with you.
Does anyone recognize her?

22:47.090 --> 22:52.120
Do you know this woman?
Was she in the water with you?

22:58.210 --> 23:02.160
Do you know this woman?
Was she in the water?

23:02.200 --> 23:08.140
No. Okay.
We should ask her as well.

23:08.180 --> 23:11.100
Do you have to?
She's heavily medicated.

23:11.140 --> 23:16.140
-I'm afraid we have to.
-Can we ask your daughter as well?

23:38.190 --> 23:43.010
-What's she saying?
-She saw her in the water.

23:44.070 --> 23:48.120
She says a monster with
glowing eyes tried to take her.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.230
Please. You're out of line.

23:51.020 --> 23:53.170
-Fine. We'll wrap things up...
-Wait!

24:00.230 --> 24:03.060
Wait. What are you talking about?

24:03.100 --> 24:07.100
Hafgufa. A sea monster
that matches her description.

24:07.140 --> 24:10.080
Please stop. This is too much. Please.

24:13.030 --> 24:15.110
Okay. I think we're done here.

24:23.050 --> 24:27.030
I'm sorry if I said something wrong.
But that girl saw something.

24:27.070 --> 24:31.110
-I could feel it.
-She was clearly psychotic.

24:31.150 --> 24:37.070
-I disagree.
-Okay. What's your professional opinion?

24:38.150 --> 24:43.030
Should we put out a wanted notice
for a prehistoric sea monster?

24:43.070 --> 24:48.080
Of course not! But life on earth
isn't as simple as you might think.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.100
Okay...

24:56.060 --> 24:59.050
Pull over.
I need to take care of something.

25:28.030 --> 25:31.030
It's that time of the month.
The lady curse.

25:31.070 --> 25:36.050
You do know you can get products
from the shop in this millennium?

25:36.090 --> 25:41.000
I can't afford that kind of luxury
with my student loan.

26:38.060 --> 26:39.220
Hi!

26:42.040 --> 26:46.220
-Is this a bad time?
-No, I'm just preparing meal time.

26:47.010 --> 26:49.120
-Goat on the menu, perhaps?
-Yes.

26:49.160 --> 26:53.100
The janitarian told me to relocate it.
So it will be in stomach.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.080
Do you have my stuff?

27:12.180 --> 27:15.160
The center for memory registration
is being shut down.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.100
The purpose was to seek out beforeigners

27:18.140 --> 27:20.180
that remembered
how they got to our time.

27:20.220 --> 27:26.050
But it appears that no timeigrants
have memories of the actual time travel.

27:26.090 --> 27:30.020
Does this mean that scientists
have given up finding an answer

27:30.060 --> 27:33.080
how the beforeigners come to our time?

27:33.120 --> 27:38.230
I wouldn't say we've given up, but
we've realized that finding an answer

27:39.020 --> 27:44.240
to these questions, is proving more
difficult than we thought it would be.

29:01.010 --> 29:04.160
-Haaland?
-I'm off the clock.

29:04.200 --> 29:08.210
I know you dislike the Hafgufa theory.
But I did some googling.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.230
The web's full of people who've seen
strange things in the ocean.

29:13.020 --> 29:16.200
There's one blog in particular,
"Paranormal is the new normal".

29:16.240 --> 29:21.070
-It had lots of exciting...
-You know what? You're right.

29:21.110 --> 29:24.220
I dismissed this way too quickly.

29:25.010 --> 29:29.200
Bring everything you've got on Hafgufa
and present it to the team tomorrow.

29:29.240 --> 29:34.060
The whole team? Isn't that a bit soon?

29:34.100 --> 29:39.030
They hired you.
They probably value your perspectives.

29:39.070 --> 29:46.010
I'll get Alex to help you make a sketch
based on what the girl told you.

29:46.050 --> 29:50.160
-Are you sure?
-Of course. Go for it.

30:00.210 --> 30:06.240
Okay, guys. Picture time and space
as a four-dimensional continuum.

30:07.030 --> 30:11.120
Time migration is presumed to occur
when the flashes bring the beforeigners

30:11.160 --> 30:16.090
to a dimension where time moves
infinitely slower than here.

30:16.130 --> 30:23.000
When they re-emerge after a short while,
hundreds of years have passed here.

30:23.040 --> 30:28.150
This is why it's considered impossible
to travel back in time.

30:30.050 --> 30:35.030
-Are you're still in on the russebus?
-Why do you ask?

30:35.070 --> 30:38.120
You have to pay Madde.
The waiting list's really long.

30:38.160 --> 30:41.050
What are you talking about?
I already paid!

30:41.090 --> 30:44.110
What? Madde says
she didn't get any money.

30:48.240 --> 30:51.110
I don't know.

31:13.030 --> 31:15.090
-Ingrid?
-Yes?

31:15.130 --> 31:18.110
-Do you have five minutes?
-Not really.

31:18.150 --> 31:20.080
I have to pay for the russebus.

31:20.120 --> 31:24.110
Right.
That's what we wanted to discuss.

31:31.120 --> 31:34.110
You see, we discovered
through social media

31:34.150 --> 31:39.190
that the bus has quite a different image
than what you described to us.

31:39.230 --> 31:45.190
I talked to the bank and told them
not to approve your transfer.

31:45.230 --> 31:49.060
-You can't! It's my money!
-You're still a minor.

31:49.100 --> 31:50.220
Have you lost your minds?

31:51.010 --> 31:55.020
You know how much
your mother and I value truthfulness.

31:55.060 --> 32:00.120
Instead of being contrary, maybe you
could tell us something about the bus?

32:00.160 --> 32:04.150
-More open-heartedly than last time?
-Like the name?

32:04.190 --> 32:09.100
I barely remember. Some boy's name.
"Ben Dover Express" or something.

32:09.140 --> 32:10.230
It's named after a boy?

32:11.120 --> 32:13.230
Madeleine picked it. It's some musician.

32:14.020 --> 32:19.220
Ingrid, just stop. We know it's
not "Ben Dover", but "bend over".

32:20.010 --> 32:25.010
As far as I understand,
it insinuates that these girls are easy?

32:25.050 --> 32:31.040
I understand it seems kind of lame
or sexist, but it's just a cover name!

32:31.080 --> 32:35.060
-We'll come up with a new name later!
-And that makes it okay?

32:35.100 --> 32:38.100
-Yes!
-This isn't you, Ingrid!

32:39.160 --> 32:44.240
"Be not one thing for a day or two
and in a twelve-month something new."

32:45.030 --> 32:49.240
"Be what you are, complete and whole,
not a divided, piecemeal soul."

32:50.030 --> 32:52.150
I don't have time for this!

32:54.000 --> 32:56.130
-Ingrid..!
-No! God...

32:56.170 --> 32:59.160
"Keep day apart from dusk."

33:00.230 --> 33:04.160
"Remember, life..."

33:04.200 --> 33:07.170
-"Is an art."
-"Is an art."

33:07.210 --> 33:10.190
The Tjuvholmen case is assigned to us.

33:10.230 --> 33:15.060
Lars and Alfhilde will be
working exclusively on that.

33:15.100 --> 33:20.230
This means more work for the rest
of you. I hope you can understand.

33:21.020 --> 33:25.210
We're working on the assumption
that the Tjuvholmen woman

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
was found murdered just hours
after arriving in our time,

33:30.040 --> 33:33.190
and that she timeigrated
in the series of arrivals

33:33.230 --> 33:40.050
logged at 4:08 AM, 4:13 AM
and 4:21 AM last night.

33:40.090 --> 33:44.230
Alfhilde, you heard
something interesting from a witness?

33:45.020 --> 33:48.000
We talked to a girl
who recognized the woman.

33:48.040 --> 33:54.060
And that's not all. She saw a creature
in the water, with the woman.

33:54.100 --> 34:00.180
I know there's some scepticism towards
alternative thinking in our field but...

34:00.220 --> 34:03.010
The girl's vision was strong.

34:03.050 --> 34:07.130
I made a sketch of what she saw,
with Alex' help.

34:07.170 --> 34:10.160
Sorry, I'm not following.

34:10.200 --> 34:14.130
An individual was seen
together with the victim?

34:14.170 --> 34:16.040
Not an individual.

34:16.080 --> 34:21.050
As far I can tell, she's talking about
a supernatural sea monster.

34:27.120 --> 34:31.090
Right...
Well, I think we've heard enough.

34:31.130 --> 34:35.140
I'm sorry, but aren't we meant
to think outside the box here?

34:35.180 --> 34:37.210
Yes, of course, Alfhildr.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.100
But we should stick to
the scientific world view of our time.

34:44.200 --> 34:47.070
Yes, Wenche...

35:01.160 --> 35:06.230
Talk about having the administration
fall on their own Viking sword.

35:14.140 --> 35:20.160
HAFGUFA!
THANKS FOR MAKING US LAUGH. ALEX

36:14.190 --> 36:16.170
She just left.

36:16.210 --> 36:20.210
Probably needed some fresh air
after that screw-up.

37:10.170 --> 37:12.070
EXIT

37:17.080 --> 37:19.070
I think you got
the wrong door, darling.

37:19.110 --> 37:22.020
I don't think so.

37:34.150 --> 37:36.160
Excuse me?

37:36.200 --> 37:40.130
Did a woman come in here just now?
Tall, with long hair?

37:40.170 --> 37:42.100
No, not that I know.

37:43.220 --> 37:49.120
-I'll just wait here for two minutes...
-You have to order something.

37:51.190 --> 37:53.020
Just normal porridge.

37:53.060 --> 37:56.180
-With sugar and cinnamon.
-We don't serve that.

37:56.220 --> 38:00.230
Cinnamon reduces
the flavor of the grains.

38:01.020 --> 38:04.200
Choose your base grain.
Cold oat cream or barley flakes?

38:04.240 --> 38:07.200
Don't you recognize me?

38:07.240 --> 38:12.150
From the old time, when you
were sailing with Olaf the Stout?

38:12.190 --> 38:17.030
-Can't say I do.
-I'd better refresh your memory.

38:18.050 --> 38:24.190
We met in Erling Skjalgsson's barn
a winter's night some 1007 years ago.

38:24.230 --> 38:29.150
I was 12, and you forced yourself
on me in the pigpen.

38:32.060 --> 38:35.110
I think you're mistaking me
for someone else.

38:35.150 --> 38:38.050
No, I'm not.

38:39.070 --> 38:41.150
And you can drop the act.

38:41.190 --> 38:45.120
I can see it in your eyes,
you remember it, too.

38:45.160 --> 38:48.110
Fine. But let me tell you something.

38:49.170 --> 38:53.060
This crap they talk about
in this day and age,

38:53.100 --> 38:58.030
that cock is so bad for young girls...

38:58.070 --> 39:01.160
That's just bullshit.

39:01.200 --> 39:07.080
The way I remember it, you were
pretty wet down there when I did you.

39:10.160 --> 39:13.080
-There you go. Enjoy.
-Thanks.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.160
Hey! Wait!

39:37.070 --> 39:41.190
-What the fuck was that about?
-I ran into an old acquaintance.

39:41.230 --> 39:43.220
An old acquaintance?

39:44.230 --> 39:49.150
I'm sorry.
I was just going to talk to him.

39:49.190 --> 39:53.060
-I just lost it.
-Okay.

39:55.070 --> 40:00.010
What if he decides to press charges,
how will you deal with that?

40:02.040 --> 40:05.060
Tell them he tripped
on his plate of porridge?

40:05.100 --> 40:10.140
Relax. That man won't set foot
in a police station voluntarily.

40:10.180 --> 40:15.010
Right. But you understand
that this is my responsibility?

40:15.050 --> 40:17.120
I have to report this.

40:17.160 --> 40:21.220
We can't have officers on the force
who are out of control.

40:23.150 --> 40:26.140
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

40:26.180 --> 40:29.240
You're a fucking hypocrite!

40:30.030 --> 40:34.000
Like you don't have any skeletons
in your closet?

40:34.040 --> 40:35.140
What do you mean?

40:35.180 --> 40:39.030
I was given temproxate when I arrived.

40:39.070 --> 40:43.190
Don't you think I've noticed
the smell of the eyedrops? Come on!

40:43.230 --> 40:46.230
I spent a week in restraints
sweating that shit out.

40:47.020 --> 40:51.090
-I know a temp addict when I see one.
-Temp addict..!

40:56.020 --> 40:59.030
Fine! Let's do this your way.

40:59.070 --> 41:03.010
We go back to the station,
you report me for police brutality,

41:03.050 --> 41:05.160
and I report you
for abusing temproxate.

41:05.200 --> 41:11.040
No big deal, you can just pee in a cup,
because you're as clean as a whistle.

41:15.240 --> 41:18.030
I'll take you home.

41:25.110 --> 41:29.120
I can see why you might think
I'm some kind of addict,

41:29.160 --> 41:32.110
but I actually have an illness.

41:34.050 --> 41:39.150
I use temproxate sporadically.
Only for medical purposes.

41:39.190 --> 41:41.230
-Whatever you say.
-Yes.

41:53.080 --> 41:55.020
Is this where you live?

41:55.060 --> 41:58.230
I had to leave the student dorm
when I got a job.

41:59.020 --> 42:04.090
-This was the cheapest house I found.
-"House" is an exaggeration...

42:59.070 --> 43:03.040
-Hello?
-Hi. I'm out here.

43:04.090 --> 43:07.070
I let myself in. Hope you don't mind.

43:07.110 --> 43:11.120
Of course not.
But why aren't you with your mum?

43:12.120 --> 43:14.240
I just can't be there right now.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.170
Is there room for me?

43:26.220 --> 43:29.050
Tell me what happened.

43:29.090 --> 43:35.020
Mum froze my bank account,
so I'll lose my spot on the russebus .

43:35.060 --> 43:37.160
Why did she do that?

43:37.200 --> 43:41.140
She thinks the cover name is too crude.

43:46.100 --> 43:48.060
What is it, then?

43:48.100 --> 43:51.180
It's kind of lame.
"Ben Dover Express".

43:55.230 --> 44:01.020
Okay... Doesn't she know what
those buses are called nowadays?

44:01.060 --> 44:03.070
That's what I said.

44:03.110 --> 44:07.160
Gregers is behind it.
He can be so strict sometimes.

44:09.180 --> 44:14.140
-Okay. How much is it?
-Quite a lot.

44:20.130 --> 44:25.000
Well...
We have credit cards in Beefcode, too.

44:27.060 --> 44:28.190
Dad...

44:30.080 --> 44:31.200
Are you sure?

44:33.010 --> 44:35.010
Of course.

44:38.230 --> 44:44.050
Good morning Christiania, this
marvellous city that you never leave

44:44.090 --> 44:47.040
without having been impregnated by it.

44:47.080 --> 44:51.160
My boss wants me to call you Oslo,
but I refuse.

44:51.200 --> 44:56.090
To me, newly awakened grace,
you will always be Christiania.

45:27.110 --> 45:31.140
Thanks for my present.
It's already in use!

45:31.180 --> 45:34.000
I'm glad to hear it.

45:34.040 --> 45:37.220
I spent half the morning
wiping moss off the car.

45:38.010 --> 45:40.030
There'll be no more of that.

45:40.070 --> 45:44.090
It's like having a soft kitty
in your underwear.

45:47.150 --> 45:51.000
-Do you know what I'm thinking?
-No.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.040
I think your noble gesture
towards my womanhood

45:54.080 --> 45:56.190
is a sign of you
appreciating my company.

45:56.230 --> 46:00.240
I think you're reading too much
into a pack of sanitary pads.

46:01.030 --> 46:06.100
"It's in the little things that
the big things let themselves be known."

46:06.140 --> 46:10.190
-What's that? Hávamál?
-Oprah Winfrey.
