05:01.551 --> 05:03.302
Don't shoot me.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.388
Who is that?

05:05.722 --> 05:08.432
BARNEY: There's your money.
Release the hostages.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.475
How much in there?

05:09.559 --> 05:10.601
BARNEY: Three.

05:10.685 --> 05:14.063
You're too late. We want $5 million, eh.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.693
What do you know? A greedy pirate.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.238
Last chance!

05:23.115 --> 05:24.115
Take it or leave it.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.617
We want the money now!

05:28.078 --> 05:29.453
-Warning shot.
-No!

05:33.959 --> 05:35.418
A little low.

05:41.425 --> 05:42.591
BARNEY: Lights out!

06:13.331 --> 06:15.916
l'll kill him! l swear l'll kill him!

06:23.383 --> 06:24.383
Drop your guns!

06:24.468 --> 06:25.509
Fat chance.

06:25.635 --> 06:26.760
Yeah, that'll happen.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.513
Last chance. Let the hostages go

06:30.307 --> 06:31.974
or you're out of there.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.477
Bring the money here to me.
(SPEAKlNG SOMALl)

06:34.686 --> 06:36.395
l'll take the four on the left.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.564
l want you to take the tzo on the right.
Leave the rest alone.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.985
l'll kill them all! l don't care.

06:43.195 --> 06:45.988
You should take the tzo on the right.
You're not that fast anymore.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.823
The only thing faster is lightning.

06:49.493 --> 06:50.493
We'll see.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.663
Bullets go faster than blades.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.416
Bring the money here now!

06:57.667 --> 06:58.667
You want the money?

07:01.338 --> 07:02.671
Go get it.

07:06.676 --> 07:07.760
What's that?

07:07.844 --> 07:09.178
l'm getting a text.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.596
Excuse me?

07:10.931 --> 07:11.931
Kill them!

07:19.189 --> 07:21.065
-l call that a tie.
-Come on, keep dreaming.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.734
These guys are arrested development.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.528
A little compassion, folks.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.071
You know, l don't think
you hit one of them.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.156
l don't see any knives, actually.

07:29.616 --> 07:30.616
How are you guys doing?

07:32.744 --> 07:35.037
-What the hell is he doing?
-Hanging a pirate.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.872
Don't be ridiculous.

07:37.541 --> 07:40.334
Gunner! What are you doing?

07:40.669 --> 07:42.419
Hanging a pirate!

07:42.712 --> 07:45.673
-That is seriously demented.
-This is no good.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.008
-You're on your own.
-Appreciate it.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.552
lt's good to have friends.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.303
-Gunner.
-Yeah?

07:51.388 --> 07:53.597
This isn't how we work. Let him go.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.599
Why? He'd do it to us.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.351
Gunner, last chance.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.311
Let him go or we're letting you go.

07:59.729 --> 08:00.896
lt's good to hang pirates.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.084
-We don't kill like that.
-Yeah?

08:22.502 --> 08:23.961
Not polite enough?

08:25.422 --> 08:27.298
-Let him go, Gunner.
-How are you doing, Barney?

08:27.716 --> 08:28.757
Pretty good.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.926
My partner here kicked me
with steel-tipped boots.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.885
-Can you believe that?
-You deserved it.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.513
l think l'll need stitches.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.639
Maybe.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.475
-l hate stitches.
-Everyone does.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.519
Let him go, Gunner.

08:40.604 --> 08:41.729
Let him go?

08:42.938 --> 08:44.023
Let him go.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.396
-Think he's cool?
-Be careful. Go.

09:40.622 --> 09:41.705
Gunner, you cool?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.001
Yeah.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.264
No, keep it.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.934
You appreciate a good blade.

10:15.907 --> 10:16.949
He all right?

10:17.033 --> 10:18.033
Yeah.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.036
The life just got to him.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.039
lt'll get to all of us.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.741
LACY: Coming!

11:03.163 --> 11:04.204
Who is it?

11:04.289 --> 11:07.875
Someday you'll find a man
who'll be happy just to watch you sleep.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.630
Hi. l didn't know you were back.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.257
-Hey, babe.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.177
Yeah, l just arrived.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.220
-Hey.
-You look great.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.182
l wish you would have called.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.642
l've never been a good caller.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.145
l haven't heard from you in over a month.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.522
Really? Time flies, huh?

11:31.191 --> 11:33.275
Won't happen again! Sorry.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.570
But l do have a surprise.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.448
Rose-flavored. Your favorite.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.995
And l did have something else for you.

11:46.247 --> 11:50.626
lt's something l picked up from Burma.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.461
lt's a ruby.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.799
lt's a good color,
but it's hard to see in this light.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.804
This kind of looked a little shinier
when l bought it in the shop, you know?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.182
MAN: Lace, everything all right?

12:09.145 --> 12:10.854
-Yeah.
-Who is he?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.149
(STUTTERlNG) He's a friend.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.360
Kind of late. You got a name?

12:19.489 --> 12:21.490
Friend. She just told you.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.160
Lee, come on.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.538
Don't leave like this. Lee, l'm sorry.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.790
CHRlSTMAS: l thought
things were good betzeen us.

12:29.874 --> 12:33.252
LACY: l felt like you never cared about
getting in my life or letting me into yours.

12:33.336 --> 12:34.878
-Stop.
-Yeah, sure l did.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.714
No.
l have known you for over a year and a half,

12:37.799 --> 12:39.633
and l don't even know
what you do for a living.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.427
What's it matter?
When l'm here, l'm with you. That matters.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.931
What matters is when you're here,
you're not really here.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.100
You're a good man. l love you, but...

12:48.184 --> 12:49.977
-Lace!
-l hate his voice.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.604
-Did you say something?
-Don't let him come down here.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.273
Please tell me you understand
what l'm saying.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.692
-You have to understand.
-CHRlSTMAS: l understand.

12:56.943 --> 12:57.943
You take care.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.278
Lee.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.659
He's no good, Lace.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.327
Hey, brother, don't you ever sleep?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.123
This is my friend...

13:54.876 --> 13:55.876
What's your name again, baby?

13:55.960 --> 13:57.044
-Cheyenne.
-Cheyenne.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.212
Cheyenne, Arapaho, Cherokee, Pawnee.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.423
You want a drink?

14:02.050 --> 14:03.300
l'm good.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.011
Why don't you run upstairs

14:06.095 --> 14:10.390
and get me one of them
super-duper six-olive martinis, baby?

14:10.475 --> 14:12.017
-Anything for you, baby.
-You got it.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.227
Whoo!

14:14.312 --> 14:16.605
-Got a crush on me.
-Like the last 50.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.231
Hey, brother, who's counting?

14:18.316 --> 14:20.942
-Damn, you look good.
-Look at you.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.028
You look like a goddamn
cold piece of steel, brother.

14:23.112 --> 14:27.407
Yeah, well.
Okay, my friend, let's finish this bird up.

14:27.909 --> 14:31.495
Well, let's do it, bro. lt's taken you
a couple of years to do a couple of letters.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.459
We had to get rid of Gunner.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.129
Ah, well, he went Crankenstein on your ass.
You got to cut him loose.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.006
You wanna fill in?

14:43.091 --> 14:44.257
Let me tell you something.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.218
Remember where we was last time?

14:46.302 --> 14:48.428
Where were we?
We were ass-deep in that mud and blood.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.556
-Nigeria.
-Yeah, your hand was all shot to shit.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.976
You were bleeding all over the place,
and l was bleeding,

14:55.645 --> 14:57.145
and you know what l did?
l promised myself,

14:58.481 --> 15:02.484
l don't wanna die all alone,
full of holes in the mud and blood.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.821
l'm gonna die with something that counts.
l'm gonna die with a woman.

15:05.988 --> 15:09.241
l wanna die with someone
who cares about me, you know.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.326
l don't wanna die for a woman.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.453
l wanna die laying next to a woman.
That's what l want.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.750
-lt's Christmastime.
-Yeah, l can smell him from here.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.591
Mr. Christmas. How you doing, brother?

15:27.135 --> 15:28.635
l'm good, Tool.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.929
Take a look at this. What do you think?

15:31.180 --> 15:33.014
lt still looks like a black chicken.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.975
-Black chicken?
-BARNEY: Black chicken? You done?

15:35.935 --> 15:38.228
TOOL: All done.
BARNEY: lt's a damn raven.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.149
Oh, man. lt's good to see you, brother.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.444
Wow! You know what?

15:47.238 --> 15:49.489
For you, l got a great idea.

15:50.199 --> 15:53.243
Why don't you let me doodle, like, a...

15:53.327 --> 15:56.413
l don't know, Charlotte's web on your head?

15:56.706 --> 15:58.123
On the top of your head.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.125
You know, something different,
something exciting.

16:00.209 --> 16:03.044
'Cause you got one of them
perfectly-shaped domed, muscular heads.

16:03.379 --> 16:07.132
l could put a web on the top of the head.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.510
Maybe a pregnant Charlotte
coming out of your ear,

16:10.595 --> 16:14.222
peeking around,
making sure them bugs don't come inside.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.391
Her long leg dangling down your neck.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.144
-Yeah. Sexy, right?
-Very sexy.

16:19.353 --> 16:22.147
Give you a little mystery,
a little more character.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.483
And very sexy. You understand?

16:24.567 --> 16:26.109
lt makes him stand out.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.528
He looks thrilled.

16:28.613 --> 16:32.407
Well. Okay, l'll tell you what.
l'm feeling a little lucky tonight.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.202
l'm feeling very accurate.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.079
-Qnother time. Come on.
-Come on, take him on.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.040
Come on, Christmas. Bring it, baby.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.500
Don't encourage him, please.

16:41.793 --> 16:42.793
He never beat you in your life.

16:42.877 --> 16:45.337
Come on, Christmas, no disgrace in losing.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.767
Oh.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.897
Yes?

17:07.777 --> 17:09.027
TOOL: Hmm.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.194
Yeah.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.323
Okay.

17:16.117 --> 17:18.161
Well, l got three pieces of work.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.833
Two a walk in the park,
and one to hell and back.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.877
-l need some time alone.
-Hey, cheer up. Make the meeting.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.603
Now we can see inside of him.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.230
And l see lies.

19:10.816 --> 19:14.486
He wasn't stealing from you.
He was stealing from us both.

19:16.113 --> 19:19.282
You want your apes' respect?
Snuff those tzo.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.130
BARNEY: Let's just keep it simple.

19:34.215 --> 19:36.675
lf the money's right,
we don't care where the job is.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.718
-Got it?
-MR. CHURCH: Let's quit jerking off,

19:38.803 --> 19:40.637
get down to business, see who's hungry.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.640
l know your real name's
probably not Barney Ross.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.600
You don't need to know my name.

19:45.685 --> 19:49.104
The only thing you need to know is
the job's real and the money's real.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.731
But since we're in this nice place,

19:52.900 --> 19:55.110
you might as well just call me Mr. Church.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.946
Okay, Church. What can l do for you?

19:58.572 --> 20:01.449
ln a minute.
l'm still waiting for one more guy.

20:01.701 --> 20:02.951
Who?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.461
(SlGHS)

20:14.213 --> 20:15.422
MR. CHURCH: You know him?

20:15.506 --> 20:17.465
Yeah, we used to be
on the same team together.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.718
What's my oldest, worst friend doing here?

20:20.052 --> 20:22.721
Both of your names came
to the top of the list.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.723
-ls that a problem?
-Yeah.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.725
Should've shot him when l had the chance.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.101
Big Barney Ross.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.270
Bigger Trench mouse.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.565
-What are you doing? Praying for work?
-Could be.

20:33.649 --> 20:34.983
Have you been sick?

20:35.401 --> 20:37.527
-You've lost weight.
-Really?

20:37.611 --> 20:40.030
Whatever weight l lost, you found, pal.

20:41.824 --> 20:44.159
You guys aren't gonna start sucking
each other's dicks, are you?

20:49.540 --> 20:52.709
Let's get down to business,
see who wants the work.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.169
You ever hear of an island called Vilena?

20:54.336 --> 20:55.879
-No.
-Yeah.

20:58.132 --> 20:59.340
lt's a little island in the Gulf.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.467
That's right.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.219
-You should read more.
-Thanks.

21:05.056 --> 21:08.058
There are resources on that island
that my people are very interested in.

21:08.350 --> 21:12.062
But a general by the name of Garza
has overthrown the half-ass government.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.605
MR. CHURCH: That's right.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.858
My people are having a problem
with this fanatic Garza.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.486
-So you want Garza gone?
-l want him dead.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.154
All it takes is a little army.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.655
Only an idiot would do this job.

21:23.324 --> 21:25.408
-How much?
-Oh, like l said.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.414
l'm busy anyway,
so give this job to my friend here.

21:31.499 --> 21:32.957
He loves playing in the jungle.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.501
-Right?
-Right.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.837
-That's right.
-Hey, why don't we have dinner?

21:38.172 --> 21:39.255
Sure. When?

21:39.548 --> 21:41.591
-ln a thousand years.
-Too soon.

21:44.762 --> 21:47.388
-What's his fucking problem?
-He wants to be president.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.936
l got to recon this island first.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.729
l'll have a contact for you on the island.

21:57.191 --> 21:58.191
Good riddance.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.152
l got a feeling everyone else
has passed on this job,

22:01.237 --> 22:03.404
so our fee is $5 mil.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.324
-$5 mil?
-And l want half upfront,

22:06.408 --> 22:07.951
and the other half in an offshore account.

22:08.035 --> 22:10.662
-You got a problem with that?
-No.

22:12.456 --> 22:16.292
What l have a problem with
is people who try to fuck me over.

22:18.420 --> 22:21.548
So if you take this money
and you don't deliver,

22:22.258 --> 22:26.594
or you try to fuck me in some kind of weird
cockamamie scheme of yours,

22:27.263 --> 22:28.972
me and my people

22:29.682 --> 22:32.350
are gonna come get you and your people

22:32.768 --> 22:37.355
and chop you up
into little fucking dog treats.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.233
You got a problem with that?

22:46.574 --> 22:47.615
Let's talk.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.105
Vilena.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.274
Yeah, Vilena.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.277
They got work there?

23:29.992 --> 23:31.201
Come on.

23:31.869 --> 23:33.453
You know you shouldn't be here, Gunner.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.413
Don't replace me.

23:36.665 --> 23:37.749
l'm good.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.002
l'm still good.

23:41.712 --> 23:43.087
You're still using.

23:43.214 --> 23:44.839
l can't trust you anymore, man.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.843
-You can't trust me?
-l can't.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.432
You can't trust me?

24:03.234 --> 24:04.525
Be careful.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.069
You threatening me, Gunner?

24:07.821 --> 24:10.240
Nah, l'm a nice guy.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.460
BARNEY: So, going over the info
this guy Church gave me,

24:22.544 --> 24:24.504
there's probably about
6,000 people on the island.

24:25.756 --> 24:26.923
How many soldiers?

24:27.091 --> 24:28.383
Maybe a couple of hundred.

24:30.052 --> 24:32.470
lt wouldn't take much more than that
to control a space that small.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.597
Great, they've got a small army.

24:34.682 --> 24:35.682
What do we got?

24:35.766 --> 24:36.849
Four and a half men.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.478
-Not so funny.
-Ooh.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.146
-l need a raise.
-Why?

24:42.231 --> 24:43.815
l need more money for my son.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.733
l want to send him to a better school.

24:45.943 --> 24:48.111
-When did Yin Yang get a family?
-l have no idea.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.071
You don't ask, l don't tell.

24:50.656 --> 24:53.449
Anyway, the pay share stays the same.

24:54.410 --> 24:55.660
That's the way it's gonna be.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.079
Now the target on this island
is a guy named General Garza.

24:58.372 --> 25:01.207
-What's the problem?
-Who gives a shit what the problem is?

25:01.709 --> 25:04.002
We got enough problems
right here of our own.

25:04.086 --> 25:07.088
We don't get rid of those first,
they're gonna get rid of us.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.258
Toll Road, when was
the last time you saw your analyst?

25:12.594 --> 25:14.345
-This morning.
-Yeah? What'd you talk about?

25:17.433 --> 25:19.600
Avoidant personality disorder.

25:19.685 --> 25:20.768
You think too much.

25:20.936 --> 25:23.604
You know, Toll Road,
you're an unusual guy,

25:24.106 --> 25:26.733
and you're always gonna have
unusual problems, right?

25:27.026 --> 25:29.360
Unusual? You're talking about my ear.

25:30.571 --> 25:32.030
Oh, come on. Don't start with the ear again.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.281
-Not the ear story.
-The ear story, not again.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.366
-We all know the ear story.
-We don't want to hear the ear story.

25:35.451 --> 25:36.534
Let's just concentrate on the job.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.245
No. Shit no. You guys started this.

25:39.496 --> 25:42.290
-We all know l wrestled in college.
-Right.

25:42.374 --> 25:46.919
A common injury associated with that sport
is trauma to the ear, a clot.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.631
Which, if left unattended,
causes a contraction in the cartilage

25:50.841 --> 25:52.884
and forms cauliflower ears.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.803
-And your point is?
-lt ain't easy being green.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.684
Anyway, me and Christmas
are gonna head down to Vilena

26:01.769 --> 26:03.895
and scout the island
to see if we should take the job.

26:03.979 --> 26:06.647
How much we get paid?
l need more money for my family.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.777
-What family?
-My family.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.004
BARNEY: Listen, that girl wasn't your type.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.672
Her loss, right?

26:31.757 --> 26:33.674
l should have broke that bastard's jaw.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.593
Maybe you were lucky.
He could have broke yours.

26:35.677 --> 26:39.305
-lmpossible.
-You know, Christmas, l understand,

26:39.390 --> 26:42.558
but let's just say you were with her
for a couple of hours,

26:42.643 --> 26:44.435
and it's nice, and it's hot and heavy,

26:44.520 --> 26:46.521
but after that, think about it.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.523
What do you do for the rest of the day?

26:48.690 --> 26:50.441
She probably did you a favor.

26:50.526 --> 26:53.194
Now you have more time
to feel sorry for yourself.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.780
You're a bleak bastard.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.847
Morning. Morning.

28:05.976 --> 28:07.768
Morning! Speak English?

28:10.397 --> 28:11.439
Big plane, huh?

28:12.316 --> 28:15.193
Yeah, we use it to transport
injured animals.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.737
-Why are you here?
-Ornithologists.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.281
We're photographing exotic birds.

28:32.836 --> 28:33.961
You're nervous?

28:34.254 --> 28:35.504
Nervous?

28:36.798 --> 28:38.549
No. Why?

28:38.926 --> 28:40.635
You just look nervous.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.970
l'm not nervous. Do l look nervous?

28:43.055 --> 28:44.305
Your skin looks a little dry.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.015
l think you should fly
with the window closed.

28:46.642 --> 28:49.936
-lt's the altitude.
-lt is the altitude. lt'll get to you.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.714
-What's the address?
-Yeah, it's in my head.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.758
Do you wanna share it?

29:21.218 --> 29:23.135
lt's the Gloria Cantina.

29:23.220 --> 29:26.180
So actually, Cantina Gloria in Spanish.

29:26.890 --> 29:29.100
Spanish. Who are you, Zorro?

29:30.602 --> 29:32.019
-Army.
-(TRUCK HONKlNG)

29:32.104 --> 29:33.396
-Shit.
-Come on.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.730
ln there.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.083
You rolling?

29:54.293 --> 29:55.334
Yeah.

29:58.088 --> 29:59.714
You, you, move the truck!

30:04.553 --> 30:06.137
Get the suit. Tighten up on the suit.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.471
CHRlSTMAS: Got him.

30:14.396 --> 30:17.148
Look at these clowns,
hand-picked monkeys.

30:27.659 --> 30:28.826
What's wrong with this picture?

30:31.538 --> 30:32.913
Everything.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.999
Let's get out of here.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.543
CHRlSTMAS: No, that's the point, you know.

30:37.627 --> 30:40.212
You think you know someone,
and you truly do not.

30:40.297 --> 30:43.341
Aren't you the guy who said,
"The man who best gets along with women

30:43.425 --> 30:45.843
"is the man who can
get along without them"?

30:45.927 --> 30:47.845
-That's bullshit.
-Truthfully, she wasn't your type.

30:47.929 --> 30:50.306
-Well, l wasn't finished.
-Look, enjoy your freedom.

30:50.390 --> 30:53.601
-Yeah, you wait till it happens to you.
-lt has.

30:59.900 --> 31:00.900
Contact's late.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.943
All right, let's go.

31:03.612 --> 31:04.779
Chill.

31:15.332 --> 31:16.707
Have you ever been rejected?

31:21.755 --> 31:24.799
You're really pushing the boundaries
of our relationship, you know that?

31:39.314 --> 31:41.524
-ls that the contact?
-Could be.

31:44.486 --> 31:45.903
Too bad she's so homely.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.321
Stay focused.

31:50.659 --> 31:51.700
Are you the contact?

31:51.785 --> 31:53.327
l'm Sandra.

31:53.787 --> 31:54.870
What are your names?

31:55.122 --> 31:56.831
Buda, Pest.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.503
Follow me, please.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.427
Buda and Pest? Nice.

32:21.064 --> 32:23.190
Did you do all these?

32:24.276 --> 32:26.652
Yes. Take one.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.362
A gift.

32:28.530 --> 32:29.864
l don't take free gifts.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.617
-How much you want for it?
-Nothing.

32:33.702 --> 32:35.661
Taking money for something is not a gift.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.497
Taking nothing for something is.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.458
CHRlSTMAS: ls it like this all the time?

32:40.834 --> 32:43.169
SANDRA: This place was a beautiful place.

32:44.087 --> 32:48.048
Then one day, they came with money,
and General Garza sold his soul.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.800
And people who fight back are killed.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.385
You said "they" came with money.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.470
Who's "they"?

32:52.554 --> 32:54.346
Some Americans. That's all l know.

32:54.931 --> 32:57.308
But someday all of this will change back.

32:58.894 --> 32:59.852
You really believe that?

32:59.936 --> 33:01.270
Yes.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.772
The best day will be
the one when we can say

33:03.857 --> 33:05.983
our lives are our own again.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.072
You have a family, Sandra?

33:12.908 --> 33:15.242
My mother, when l was little, she died.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.245
And my father, he's gone, too.

33:19.581 --> 33:21.457
Sandra, how close
can you get to the palace?

33:21.583 --> 33:23.375
The palace? Why?

33:23.835 --> 33:26.086
We just wanna check out the view.

33:26.546 --> 33:27.671
There is no view.

33:27.756 --> 33:29.423
Why don't we just go there anyway, okay?

33:43.897 --> 33:45.189
Where is my grove?

33:46.608 --> 33:48.567
Where is your manpower?

33:53.281 --> 33:56.450
Do you know how long it takes
for a coca field to produce?

33:56.785 --> 33:58.202
Of course you don't. Let me tell you.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.496
We are eight weeks behind schedule.

34:00.872 --> 34:04.083
Kick your peasants' asses.
Get me my product.

34:04.292 --> 34:08.420
When you talk like this to me
in front of my men, it's no good.

34:10.172 --> 34:12.299
l am your lifeline.

34:12.634 --> 34:14.969
l am the one who coordinates
all this confusion.

34:15.594 --> 34:17.429
l am making you rich.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.556
And being wealthy is very good.

34:19.641 --> 34:23.643
lt allows people to be the real asswipes
nature intended them to be.

34:28.650 --> 34:32.820
Sometimes things
are just not worth the money.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.572
Sure they are.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.422
Sandra, are we close?

34:51.755 --> 34:52.922
lt's just over there.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.675
Pull over, please.

35:01.266 --> 35:04.059
-SANDRA: Where are you going?
-Where am l going?

35:04.728 --> 35:06.895
Well, l suppose you could say

35:06.980 --> 35:09.732
l like to look at the world
from different views.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.360
Don't lose my hat.

35:17.490 --> 35:18.657
We should get going.

35:19.367 --> 35:20.868
He's very emotional.

36:01.451 --> 36:03.452
SANDRA: What are you looking for?

36:06.915 --> 36:10.501
Sandra, how do l know
you're not setting us up?

36:11.169 --> 36:13.128
What does "setting us up" mean?

36:13.213 --> 36:15.506
You don't look like the kind of person
that we deal with all the time.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.758
How did you get involved in this?

36:17.967 --> 36:19.760
An American came here.

36:19.844 --> 36:23.931
He asked my friend to show you around.
He was afraid, so he asked me to.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.015
And you're not afraid?

36:25.225 --> 36:26.683
l'm afraid.

36:26.976 --> 36:29.228
But he said maybe you can help Vilena.

36:29.771 --> 36:31.438
l don't think so.

36:31.815 --> 36:34.149
Listen, if l were you, l'd leave.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.652
Just leave.

36:44.119 --> 36:45.786
You should leave.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.337
Don't say anything. Let me talk.

37:28.913 --> 37:29.997
Run!

37:55.482 --> 37:57.191
-Get her.
-Got it.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.247
Are you crazy?

38:12.415 --> 38:14.458
-You could have killed me!
-You're welcome.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.339
What?

38:22.842 --> 38:25.552
All right, speed it up. We're on the way.

38:30.433 --> 38:31.934
lf we get out of here, it's a miracle.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.604
-She's coming with us, right?
-She'd better.

38:38.441 --> 38:39.983
-How can we leave?
-We got a plane.

38:40.068 --> 38:42.402
-No, l can't leave.
-Yeah, well, you don't have a choice.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.571
-Yes, l do.
-Yeah? They'll find you in an hour.

38:44.739 --> 38:47.366
-Maybe, but l'm staying.
-Staying for what? There's nothing here.

38:47.575 --> 38:48.867
Not to you.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.789
Look, if you stay, then you're dead.
She's leaving with us.

39:41.963 --> 39:44.172
-l got the guys inside.
-Give me a 60-second lead.

39:44.299 --> 39:45.966
-You got it. Go, go, go!
-Come on.

40:02.734 --> 40:03.734
Get in.

40:05.028 --> 40:06.069
-Get in.
-No.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.487
-Get in.
-No, no, l can't.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.615
-Let's go.
-l can't. l belong here.

40:09.699 --> 40:11.617
-There's no time.
-Go, you go.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.577
Please, go.

40:13.661 --> 40:14.661
Shit.

40:32.305 --> 40:33.430
Hey!

40:35.391 --> 40:36.391
You look nervous.

41:01.959 --> 41:03.126
Come on!

41:18.059 --> 41:19.267
Run, you bastard!

41:23.356 --> 41:24.564
Come on!

42:09.944 --> 42:11.945
-Where's the girl?
-Gone. She wouldn't leave.

42:12.029 --> 42:13.572
Wouldn't leave?

42:14.031 --> 42:15.615
Why the hell would anybody wanna stay?

42:25.960 --> 42:27.335
The hell...

42:29.630 --> 42:31.047
The hell with it.

42:31.132 --> 42:33.717
-Climb, baby, climb.
-Come on, baby.

42:45.646 --> 42:46.646
God damn it.

42:55.156 --> 42:56.531
-Going back?
-Yeah.

42:56.616 --> 42:58.658
-Fry and die.
-Fry and die. Let's do it.

44:11.524 --> 44:13.275
What are they doing?

44:32.295 --> 44:33.378
Yes!

44:45.099 --> 44:46.266
Great job.

44:47.268 --> 44:48.435
That was a statement.

45:06.829 --> 45:10.498
How did tzo obvious professionals
pass right through security personnel,

45:10.583 --> 45:12.959
kill 41 soldiers and get away?

45:14.170 --> 45:15.837
With help, that's how.

45:16.464 --> 45:19.674
Everything's under control,
except one detail,

45:19.759 --> 45:23.219
a daughter who wants her father
and company dead and gone.

45:23.304 --> 45:24.888
Bad Shakespeare.

45:25.389 --> 45:28.141
Somehow the company parasites got to her.

45:28.267 --> 45:29.976
Look, she's your daughter, and that's tragic.

45:31.687 --> 45:33.813
But blood or not, she goes.

45:34.857 --> 45:36.650
Call it the price of doing business.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.152
You don't kill your familia.

45:39.820 --> 45:42.614
Come around my house
during the holidays, pal.

46:02.551 --> 46:03.843
Nice bird.

46:04.929 --> 46:06.262
First of all, l don't feel comfortable

46:06.347 --> 46:08.890
talking business with a giant
carrying a shotgun.

46:09.433 --> 46:10.767
Pretty boy wouldn't give it up.

46:11.185 --> 46:12.477
Not if you wanna know where they are.

46:12.728 --> 46:13.853
What do you know?

46:14.230 --> 46:15.230
l used to be one of them.

46:19.986 --> 46:20.944
Why are you turning on them?

46:21.028 --> 46:22.112
Lovers' quarrel.

46:23.739 --> 46:24.739
We settle on 50.

46:24.907 --> 46:26.116
No, math whizz.

46:26.575 --> 46:29.369
We settle on 1 00 grand,
upfront, in my pocket.

46:30.121 --> 46:31.830
The guy thinks he's a real badass.

46:32.206 --> 46:33.873
This geezer's a bloody joke.

46:34.208 --> 46:35.709
Life's a joke, shitbird!

46:37.461 --> 46:39.796
lf you don't want that Fu Manchu
knocked back into the '60s,

46:39.880 --> 46:43.383
you'd better keep your gum-chewing trap
shut and show some respect!

46:44.010 --> 46:45.135
Bring it.

46:45.219 --> 46:46.469
Hey, be nice.

46:47.263 --> 46:49.180
Need a facelift, pretty boy?

46:51.892 --> 46:52.892
Back off, Paine.

46:52.977 --> 46:54.019
l'm gonna kill him.

46:54.103 --> 46:55.520
We need him.

46:57.231 --> 46:58.523
Back off!

47:03.654 --> 47:05.238
BARNEY: Here's what l think is happening.

47:05.322 --> 47:08.700
This guy who calls himself Church
is really a front for the ClA.

47:09.076 --> 47:10.994
YANG: So we're working for the agency?

47:11.078 --> 47:13.538
BARNEY: Yeah.
Church hired us to take out the General,

47:13.622 --> 47:16.583
but the real target's this guy,
James Munroe.

47:18.586 --> 47:20.920
He used to be with the agency,
but got greedy,

47:21.005 --> 47:22.589
went rogue and teamed up with the General

47:22.673 --> 47:24.758
to keep the whole drug operation
for themselves.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.885
And that's a big cash loss.

47:26.969 --> 47:30.013
But Church and the agency
can't afford to send in the Navy SEALs

47:30.097 --> 47:32.766
or the Special Forces
to take out one of their own.

47:32.850 --> 47:36.061
That'd be a bad headline,
so they hire us to kill him.

47:37.104 --> 47:38.730
And they're back in business.

47:38.814 --> 47:41.941
CHRlSTMAS: And we're taken out.
BARNEY: Nobody's gonna miss us.

47:42.318 --> 47:44.611
YANG: ls it still $5 million?
BARNEY: You'd never live to spend it.

47:44.695 --> 47:47.238
l'm telling Church the deal's off.

47:47.698 --> 47:49.365
Sound about right?

47:49.450 --> 47:50.533
CHRlSTMAS: That's about right.

47:50.618 --> 47:51.659
YANG: l agree.

48:17.019 --> 48:18.436
Where is he?

48:32.118 --> 48:34.410
-Who the hell is that?
-Some punk.

48:34.787 --> 48:37.247
-Don't worry about it.
-We got your back.

48:37.331 --> 48:40.166
MAN: lf he comes over here,
we'll bust his ass.

48:46.799 --> 48:48.049
What do you want?

48:49.343 --> 48:50.593
Your life.

48:51.554 --> 48:52.679
l was thinking about taking it.

48:52.763 --> 48:53.930
ls that right?

48:54.014 --> 48:58.059
But l don't do so well in tight spaces,
so going to prison worries me.

48:59.478 --> 49:00.645
You shouldn't have bruised her face.

49:00.729 --> 49:01.729
Really?

49:01.856 --> 49:03.690
l would have liked to have kept it
the way it was.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.608
Keep the bitch, 'cause l'm done with it.

49:37.308 --> 49:38.308
Lee.

49:43.981 --> 49:47.734
Next time, l'll deflate all your balls, friend.

49:57.620 --> 50:00.079
Now you know what l do for a living.

50:00.623 --> 50:02.624
l'm not perfect, but you should have waited.

50:04.126 --> 50:05.877
l was worth it.

51:06.730 --> 51:08.398
So your daughter paints, too?

51:10.359 --> 51:12.068
This is how it starts!

51:12.403 --> 51:13.861
Let's go. There's nothing here.

51:13.946 --> 51:16.281
Or how it ends!

51:44.518 --> 51:47.603
What's the matter, Barney?
Don't you ever sleep?

51:47.688 --> 51:49.605
No. What happened to your girlfriend?

51:49.773 --> 51:52.775
Another one bites the dust,
brother.

51:53.694 --> 51:58.114
l was gonna paint this for her,
and you know what? l'm gonna finish it.

51:58.490 --> 52:00.783
Then l'm just gonna smash the shit
out of it.

52:00.868 --> 52:02.285
You wanna be alone?

52:03.871 --> 52:05.997
Not really. So, what's up?

52:06.373 --> 52:08.458
On this island, there was this girl.

52:08.542 --> 52:10.626
There usually are.

52:10.711 --> 52:15.465
You know, she showed us around.
She was the target's daughter.

52:17.259 --> 52:21.262
And when she had a chance to leave,
she didn't do it.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.557
She had some guts.

52:25.851 --> 52:28.311
Why can't l get that out of my mind?

52:28.562 --> 52:29.771
Hmm.

52:29.897 --> 52:31.939
You know, she stands for something.

52:32.024 --> 52:34.108
You know, man, we don't stand for shit.

52:34.193 --> 52:39.364
We used to, but that dried all up,
like this is gonna dry all up.

52:39.448 --> 52:41.741
This here paint is gonna dry.

52:42.576 --> 52:44.035
What dried up?

52:44.119 --> 52:45.286
Hmm.

52:46.413 --> 52:49.165
Just belief, man. Just the belief in the soul,

52:49.249 --> 52:52.335
just, l don't know,
the human parts, brother.

52:53.587 --> 52:55.922
You remember that time
we was up in Bosnia?

52:56.673 --> 53:00.301
We took down them Serb bad boys.

53:02.513 --> 53:05.765
All our guys were getting chopped up
all around us,

53:06.600 --> 53:08.434
and there was blood everywhere.

53:08.519 --> 53:10.269
l never thought l was gonna make it
out of there,

53:10.354 --> 53:13.314
-and l know you didn't, either.
-Yeah.

53:13.399 --> 53:16.859
Kind of feeling like dead, too, you know?

53:16.944 --> 53:19.654
My head's all a very black place.

53:19.738 --> 53:21.697
l don't believe in shit.

53:22.616 --> 53:25.451
Just goddamn Dracula black.

53:26.703 --> 53:31.374
l remember l got this bottle of the local shit
they have over there, that Slivovitz.

53:31.458 --> 53:34.627
l don't know,
l think that's what it was called.

53:35.379 --> 53:37.463
And l ain't feeling no pain now.

53:39.049 --> 53:40.508
And l'd come up on this...

53:42.136 --> 53:44.762
l'd come up on this old wooden bridge,
and l see this...

53:51.186 --> 53:54.689
l see this woman standing there, you know?
And she's...

53:55.899 --> 53:57.650
l stepped out, and she saw me,

53:57.734 --> 54:02.321
and she's just looking right in my eyes,
and l was looking right in her eyes.

54:04.116 --> 54:06.075
l knew what she was gonna do.

54:06.160 --> 54:09.662
She looked at me,
and l knew she was gonna jump.

54:10.664 --> 54:11.914
You know what l did, man?

54:11.999 --> 54:17.211
l just turned around and l kept walking,
until l heard that splash.

54:20.632 --> 54:22.592
Then she was gone.

54:24.553 --> 54:26.929
And after taking all them lives,

54:27.014 --> 54:32.602
here was one that l could have saved,
but l didn't.

54:35.230 --> 54:37.648
And what l realized later on was,

54:40.027 --> 54:43.321
if l had saved that woman, l might have,

54:45.657 --> 54:48.367
l don't know,
saved what was left of my soul, you know?

55:32.287 --> 55:38.000
A very wise dead man once told me
that a real man never strikes a woman.

55:39.044 --> 55:43.256
You push some if you have to,
but you never strike them.

55:44.758 --> 55:46.801
That's the way l was raised.

55:46.885 --> 55:51.180
This man, however,
does not share that moral dilemma. No.

55:52.724 --> 55:54.100
This man,

55:57.271 --> 55:58.604
well...

55:59.565 --> 56:04.527
So the question, Sandra,
why were the Americans here?

56:54.703 --> 56:56.537
Don't fight back.

56:58.165 --> 56:59.665
Just relax.

57:30.072 --> 57:32.948
Again, what did the Americans tell you?

57:33.659 --> 57:35.242
Who were they after?

57:37.621 --> 57:39.038
Continue.

57:59.893 --> 58:02.770
BARNEY: l'm going back to Vilena.
CHRlSTMAS: Yeah? Something change?

58:03.271 --> 58:04.980
-What's the plan?
-There is no plan.

58:05.065 --> 58:08.651
-Wait, wait, wait. We need a strategy.
-l'm going. You're not.

58:08.735 --> 58:11.404
-What?
-l said l'm going. You guys aren't.

58:11.488 --> 58:14.323
-What are you, out of your mind?
-lt's personal business.

58:14.408 --> 58:16.992
-You don't owe that woman nothing.
-l didn't say l did.

58:17.077 --> 58:19.120
You want to kill yourself? Go ahead, fine.
Your call.

58:19.204 --> 58:22.206
Listen, l don't want to kill myself.
You guys, take care. l got to do this.

58:22.290 --> 58:24.208
-Hey, hey, hey.
-What?

58:24.292 --> 58:26.043
Don't lay this guilt crap on us.
We don't deserve it.

58:26.128 --> 58:30.673
This is my choice. There's no guilt.
There's no guilt. Take care.

58:36.346 --> 58:39.181
Yeah, fuck it. His choice. Yeah.

58:48.275 --> 58:49.400
l said l'm going alone.

58:49.484 --> 58:50.484
l'm going, too.

58:50.694 --> 58:52.486
Come on, Yang, get the hell out.

58:52.654 --> 58:54.113
Just drive.

59:03.707 --> 59:05.958
Don't lose your nerve.

59:07.586 --> 59:09.795
Don't talk to me, cockroach.

59:21.391 --> 59:23.434
So, why are you doing this?

59:23.518 --> 59:25.227
Friends die together.

59:26.980 --> 59:29.273
Hey. Give me the good luck ring. Come on.

59:30.233 --> 59:32.151
Don't make me hurt you, Yang. Come on.

59:33.695 --> 59:35.362
-Speed better than luck.
-Whatever.

59:37.115 --> 59:38.157
lt's difficult.

59:38.533 --> 59:39.575
What is?

59:39.993 --> 59:41.994
My life is difficult. l need more money.

59:42.078 --> 59:43.078
Why is that?

59:43.163 --> 59:45.206
-l work harder than the rest.
-No, you don't.

59:45.290 --> 59:49.919
Yes, l do. Because they're taller,
everything is harder for me.

59:50.003 --> 59:53.756
When l get hurt, the wound is bigger
because l'm smaller.

59:53.840 --> 59:55.090
Mmm.

59:55.175 --> 59:57.009
When l travel, l need to go farther.

59:57.093 --> 59:58.511
l know, 'cause you're smaller, right?

59:58.845 --> 59:59.970
Yes.

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:03.349
My life is harder than you think.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.854
-l need more money.
-l know. You told me.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.272
For your family, right?

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:11.607
l don't have family.

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:12.691
l know.

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:15.611
Maybe one day l will.

01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:18.155
-Down!

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:45.808
-Get out there!
-Why me?

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.309
Because you're smaller.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.078
Oops.

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:07.413
Do that again, l'll kill you!

01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:44.617
Gunner!

01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:50.998
Come on, Gunner.

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:54.209
Man's good.

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:29.453
What are you doing? You're dead, junkie!

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:36.835
lnsect.

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:51.725
Bail!

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:01.819
Shit!

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:31.724
Yang!

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:42.609
What do you wear, size three?
Bring it, happy feet.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:49.635
My turn!

01:04:58.061 --> 01:04:59.102
Gunner!

01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:07.736
Shit!

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.099
You shot me.

01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:40.727
Hey, don't say that.
You were gonna kill him.

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.313
l was just gonna scare him.

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:45.857
Don't put that on me. You never liked him.

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:50.404
Am l dying?

01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:52.781
The shot's a couple of inches
above your heart.

01:05:55.577 --> 01:05:57.536
l'll take that as a yes.

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:03.959
Gunner, who sent you? Who hired you?

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:06.753
Who cares?

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:07.879
Do yourself a favor.

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:13.760
Don't go out a total asshole.
Cooperate for once in your miserable life.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.597
Then bury me right.

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:18.140
You got it.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:22.644
Who sent you? Who sent you?
ls the girl still alive?

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:24.146
Come closer.

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:44.791
You know, it's not easy being your friend.

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:46.668
That's true.

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:49.254
Man, we'll die with you.
Just don't ask us to do it tzice.

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:53.425
l know the layout.
l'll tell you about it on the way.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.052
What the hell happened to you?

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:56.887
lt's too sad to talk about it.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:01.683
CHRlSTMAS: Let's fly.

01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:22.412
You know, the enemy's
always been terrified of noise,

01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:24.289
especially shotguns.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:28.293
With this big boy spitting out
250 rounds a minute,

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:30.087
you tell me who's tolerating that.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.841
Absolutely zero.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:39.346
So let me get this right.
Gunner tries to kill you, you shoot him

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:41.431
and, at death's door,
he gives you the whole layout?

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:42.891
Yeah, something like that.

01:07:42.975 --> 01:07:45.686
-l would have win.
-l know you would have win.

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:51.608
You know what? l trust you.

01:07:52.276 --> 01:07:54.569
l want you to meet my girlfriend.

01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:58.323
Omya Kaboom.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:07:59.908
You lost me there.

01:07:59.992 --> 01:08:02.661
When Omya's prime is struck,

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:06.164
she gets off a miniature warhead
that arms itself.

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:09.876
And when that happens,
anything that gets in my lady's way

01:08:09.961 --> 01:08:12.629
becomes instant red sauce and Jell-O.

01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:14.005
And if that doesn't work,

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:20.095
her sister will.

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:21.638
You should meet my doctor.

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:23.055
Too late.

01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:51.853
lt's 3:36. We have 20 minutes
to take this place down.

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:53.814
l'll take the cellar.

01:09:53.898 --> 01:09:55.148
We've got company.

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.776
l got him. You guys take off.

01:10:26.138 --> 01:10:28.890
ls there a reason you've taken
the soldiers this man has trained

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:31.351
and made them look like fools?

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:34.479
GARZA: They look like warriors.

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:41.111
Warriors loyal to me.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:46.491
l thought the people of Vilena
hired these mercenaries to kill me.

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:52.414
But then l think maybe this is your plan,
because you cannot control me.

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:55.959
And torturing Sandra works for you.

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:59.671
You want to kill her to make me suffer.

01:11:01.007 --> 01:11:04.259
A man can never kill a child.

01:11:05.469 --> 01:11:06.803
But you can.

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:08.805
Bring Sandra here.

01:11:09.682 --> 01:11:13.727
Bring her now or l will kill you.

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:15.186
Go get her.

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.831
No, no.
-Sandra, Sandra, it's me. Sandra.

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:25.293
Hey, it's me, it's me. Sandra, it's me.

01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:28.838
lt's me. lt's me. lt's okay.

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:32.342
Nobody's gonna hurt you, all right?

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:33.760
How are you here?

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:35.428
l just am.

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:39.265
-Can you move?
-Yes.

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:40.809
Okay.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:43.228
Yeah, okay. All right, let's go.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:48.149
Time's up.

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:49.567
-Where's Barney?
-What's the call?

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:50.652
We can't find him in 1 0 minutes,

01:14:50.736 --> 01:14:51.694
we're going out the same way we came in.

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:53.113
-No way.
-That's what he'd want.

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.240
Ten minutes! Let's go.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:24.102
No. Stop him!

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:27.147
-This is not his fight. lt's mine.
-Get her out of here.

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:29.357
Seal the building.

01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:32.318
Stand him up.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:38.992
You know,
if you didn't have this Kevlar vest,

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:41.327
your insides are gonna be
like fucking mush.

01:15:41.412 --> 01:15:42.537
Well, ain't that sad?

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:43.788
You know, you're a lucky man.

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:45.373
You're the lucky man.

01:15:45.457 --> 01:15:47.834
No, no, you're a lucky man.

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:50.879
-He told me to keep you conscious.
-Did he?

01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:54.215
All right.

01:15:57.970 --> 01:15:59.512
You're a real tough guy, aren't you?

01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:02.056
-What?
-Are you a real tough guy?

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:04.517
Look at me, you piece of trash.

01:16:04.643 --> 01:16:06.186
How many men you got?

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:07.896
Just your mother.

01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:22.869
Now this is your last time.

01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:26.539
You give me the right answer,
and l'll cut you a break.

01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:31.544
lf you give me the wrong answer,
you will die a damn slow death.

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:33.213
-Do you understand me?

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:35.089
-Do you understand me?
-Yep.

01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:38.009
-Who sent you?
-Can't breathe.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:39.260
Loosen up.

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:41.721
Who sent you?

01:16:44.224 --> 01:16:46.267
Your hairdresser.

01:18:58.233 --> 01:18:59.484
Go, we gotta go!

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:22.173
Come on.

01:19:45.697 --> 01:19:46.781
Shit!

01:20:08.428 --> 01:20:09.887
Remember this shit at Christmas!

01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:14.517
Damn, that thing's loud.

01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:17.186
-What happened to you?
-l got my ass kicked.

01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:21.440
Come on. Get my rifle. Let's go.

01:20:28.615 --> 01:20:29.740
What's this?

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:34.996
Everything bad that has happened,
you bring.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.664
Take your money!

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:40.918
l only see death with you. Take it all and go.

01:20:41.086 --> 01:20:42.295
l'm not going anywhere.

01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:43.629
You are done here.

01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:45.006
You can't succeed without me.

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:46.549
l am the leader.

01:20:46.633 --> 01:20:48.134
You're a puppet in a hat.

01:20:49.761 --> 01:20:50.887
No.

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:10.948
Now!

01:21:13.744 --> 01:21:15.077
Get back.

01:21:23.962 --> 01:21:25.588
Throw down your weapons.

01:21:26.965 --> 01:21:28.507
There's no way out.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.720
Shit's getting old!

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:35.264
-Your lucky ring stinks.
-l know.

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:37.308
-Let's backtrack.
-The building's rigged.

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:39.435
lt's the only way out.

01:21:49.988 --> 01:21:51.280
Chopper's ready in five minutes.

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:52.406
We're not leaving yet.

01:22:02.042 --> 01:22:04.919
-What's he saying?
-He said we're dead with an accent.

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:06.337
We ain't dead.

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:08.214
-Blow the building.
-Not yet.

01:22:08.298 --> 01:22:11.926
We will kill this American disease.

01:22:29.486 --> 01:22:30.778
Blow the building!

01:22:30.862 --> 01:22:32.113
She's still in there!

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:33.698
The money!

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:45.710
Blow it!

01:22:51.883 --> 01:22:54.802
She's out. Blow the fucking building!

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:46.205
l'm out!

01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:41.677
Let's go. Come on.

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:44.221
BARNEY: Cut Munroe off!

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:45.449
Come on!

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:28.218
Hey!

01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:29.762
-Thing's too heavy.
-Give me it.

01:28:29.846 --> 01:28:31.930
-What do you want me to do?
-Throw it as hard as you can.

01:28:58.583 --> 01:29:00.417
-Blow the dump.
-Got it!

01:29:32.742 --> 01:29:33.784
Munroe!

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:39.123
Drop the weapons,
or l'll put a bullet through her eye.

01:29:41.418 --> 01:29:42.626
Don't test me.

01:29:53.513 --> 01:29:55.055
SANDRA: No, no, no.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.474
Shut up or l'll kill you.

01:29:59.352 --> 01:30:02.521
MUNROE: The agency parasites hired you,
didn't they?

01:30:02.605 --> 01:30:06.483
l'd have paid you tzice as much
to go fishing.

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:09.278
You'd have to think
l'm pretty freaking stupid

01:30:09.362 --> 01:30:11.113
to surrender to the agency.

01:30:11.197 --> 01:30:15.993
Why would l do that? l created this.
l made it all happen.

01:30:16.536 --> 01:30:20.664
And then they wanted me out. Why?
Because l saw the big picture.

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:22.750
Stop walking.

01:30:24.586 --> 01:30:28.589
And what about me and you?
We're both the same.

01:30:28.673 --> 01:30:32.801
We're both mercenaries.
We're both dead inside.

01:30:33.178 --> 01:30:35.220
So why the hell did you come after me?

01:30:35.305 --> 01:30:38.766
l didn't come after you, dipshit.
l came for her!

01:30:57.994 --> 01:30:59.703
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:31:00.497 --> 01:31:02.164
Call it a tie.

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:06.001
Yeah, l guess so.

01:31:06.377 --> 01:31:08.754
You know, you're not as fast as you think.

01:31:08.838 --> 01:31:11.006
l'm beginning to sense that.

01:31:23.770 --> 01:31:27.815
The second account number's mine.
lt'll help get things going around here.

01:31:27.899 --> 01:31:30.234
No, l can't. You've done so much.

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:34.571
Yeah, well, so have you. A gift for a gift.
You take it.

01:31:35.031 --> 01:31:39.076
-Will you come back?
-l promise l'll always be around.

01:31:48.127 --> 01:31:49.711
You take care, Sandra.

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:53.715
You take care.

01:31:59.722 --> 01:32:00.889
Bye.

01:32:27.959 --> 01:32:28.959
What?

01:32:29.627 --> 01:32:30.627
Truthfully?

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:32.212
Yeah?

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:34.548
l never really thought she was your type.

01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:01.533
TOOL: All right, baby. All right.

01:33:01.618 --> 01:33:02.993
Come on, let's see what you got.

01:33:04.329 --> 01:33:05.454
HALE: Oh! Oh!

01:33:05.538 --> 01:33:06.830
TOOL: That's my boy!

01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:12.836
Go south!

01:33:16.674 --> 01:33:18.175
Oh! Oh!

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:20.344
You lost! You lost!

01:33:22.889 --> 01:33:23.931
Whoo!

01:33:24.015 --> 01:33:26.516
So you're back from the dead.
How you healing?

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:30.562
Good, considering
you could have killed me.

01:33:30.688 --> 01:33:32.230
l forgive you.

01:33:32.523 --> 01:33:33.774
Okay.

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:35.943
l would have win.

01:33:36.027 --> 01:33:37.694
Of course.

01:33:39.781 --> 01:33:40.822
Hey, Gunner.

01:33:41.532 --> 01:33:44.534
Whatever doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, brother. Therapy.

01:33:45.912 --> 01:33:47.204
Man's got a point.

01:33:51.417 --> 01:33:52.542
You know what?

01:33:53.044 --> 01:33:54.753
l'm gonna do you a favor, Tool.

01:33:56.255 --> 01:33:58.632
"l once knew a man called Tool..."

01:33:58.716 --> 01:34:00.467
l love poetry.

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:04.179
"To me, was the epitome of cool

01:34:05.765 --> 01:34:07.057
CHRlSTMAS: "He was good with a knife

01:34:10.103 --> 01:34:11.812
"Bad with a wife..."

01:34:13.022 --> 01:34:14.022
That hurts.

01:34:14.107 --> 01:34:16.358
"But to think he could beat me

01:34:17.443 --> 01:34:20.570
"Dreaming he'd defeat me

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:23.573
"Cool Tool

01:34:25.702 --> 01:34:27.035
"You gotta be a fool"

01:34:31.249 --> 01:34:32.666
Oh, yeah.
