00:13.912 --> 00:15.203
Glad you're home.

00:17.491 --> 00:19.832
I was worried you'd marched
over a cliff or something.

00:19.892 --> 00:22.112
Your dad went back to the office.
He dropped your sister

00:22.165 --> 00:24.345
at a friend's house to do homework. If

00:24.639 --> 00:27.232
that band director wants
to do all those fancy precision drills

00:27.272 --> 00:29.865
that go on for hours,
he should just move to North Korea.

00:30.315 --> 00:32.180
Seriously, that man is a nut.

00:32.351 --> 00:33.636
Mom, no, he's not.

00:33.756 --> 00:35.681
I dont know.
It just seems like a lot of hours

00:35.742 --> 00:38.823
to be spending marching around
with a French horn going nowhere.

00:38.949 --> 00:41.524
Nowhere? We could end
up at state championships.

00:42.269 --> 00:43.688
State championships?

00:47.051 --> 00:49.259
I made pot roast.
Your favorite.

01:03.700 --> 01:07.450
You know, I could call up that Kim Jong
Il wannabe and complain if you want.

01:07.591 --> 01:09.701
By the time you get home,
you barely have time

01:09.742 --> 01:12.276
to eat and do your homework,
let alone have any fun.

01:14.681 --> 01:16.141
You're only young once.

01:16.282 --> 01:18.289
You should be having a little fun.

03:30.123 --> 03:31.238
- Who?
- Who?

03:31.378 --> 03:32.655
Mark Molina.

03:32.826 --> 03:34.042
The new counselor?

03:34.383 --> 03:36.329
The new single delicious counselor.

03:38.892 --> 03:40.129
That's it?

03:40.261 --> 03:42.673
You've got something more
exciting than Mark Molina?

03:53.079 --> 03:54.559
I had sex.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.396
- No, you didn't.
- With who?

03:57.457 --> 03:58.978
- You couldn't have.
- How was it?

03:59.012 --> 04:00.718
- Impossible.
- Back to who.

04:01.621 --> 04:04.278
So, when are you gonna
quit teasing me, Adrian?

04:04.398 --> 04:05.655
I'm hurtin'here.

04:05.777 --> 04:08.037
The past two nights
have almost killed me.

04:08.265 --> 04:11.225
I can't take the stop and go,
especially the stop.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.849
- that's too bad.
- No kidding.

04:14.110 --> 04:16.146
It's not good for a guy.
It's unhealthy.

04:16.272 --> 04:17.367
Dangerous, even.

04:17.411 --> 04:19.897
I heard of a guy who had
to go to the hospital for that.

04:19.946 --> 04:23.148
Permanently damaged him.
He's, like, sterile or somethin'now.

04:23.607 --> 04:26.445
Well, I told you,
I don't do it on the first date.

04:26.693 --> 04:27.747
Or the second.

04:27.993 --> 04:30.532
We've been out on more
than a couple of dates.

04:30.646 --> 04:34.275
Just dropping by my house when
my mother's not home is not a date.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.362
Well, I'll take you somewhere.

04:36.702 --> 04:38.324
Tonight's the third date.

04:40.102 --> 04:41.106
Fine, then.

04:41.643 --> 04:42.667
Tonight.

04:42.935 --> 04:44.036
What time tonight?

04:44.889 --> 04:46.531
Any time you like.

04:47.472 --> 04:48.189
Hi!

04:49.189 --> 04:50.292
Hi, Grace.

04:51.311 --> 04:54.171
That's a really nice name.
Grace.

04:54.610 --> 04:55.464
Thank you.

04:56.467 --> 04:58.028
Can we help you with something?

04:58.212 --> 05:00.360
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have interrupted. I just,

05:00.480 --> 05:03.378
I saw you and thought maybe
you were going to the game together.

05:03.512 --> 05:07.443
I wanted to invite you both to our
church for a post-game celebration.

05:07.563 --> 05:09.813
With the gym being repaired
there's nothing at school,

05:09.853 --> 05:12.286
so we thought we'd try
to invite everyone to our church.

05:12.528 --> 05:14.799
We have a gym in the
Youth Fellowship Hall.

05:17.190 --> 05:19.156
There won't be a sermon, I promise.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.807
Just music, dancing, and we always
have really good food,

05:23.042 --> 05:24.846
and it's free.
To everyone.

05:25.456 --> 05:26.429
We'd love to.

05:27.012 --> 05:28.309
But, we can't.

05:28.431 --> 05:31.065
See, my mom's out of town,
so we're going over to my house

05:31.187 --> 05:33.437
to drink beer and have sex.

05:37.762 --> 05:39.383
She's so funny, isn't she?

05:39.434 --> 05:41.569
- Funny?
- Well, I'm sure she didn't mean that.

05:41.691 --> 05:44.346
She was just trying to shock me,
and it worked.

05:44.938 --> 05:46.114
Really, could you come?

05:46.138 --> 05:48.712
You and Adrian could bring anyone
you want, as many people as you want.

05:48.752 --> 05:51.175
- Everyone's welcome.
- Will you be there, Grace?

05:52.853 --> 05:56.420
Hey, Joe, aren't you kind
of an expert on Leonardo da Vinci?

05:56.568 --> 05:58.149
I'm an expert on a lot of things.

05:58.568 --> 06:01.325
I hear the first report
up in history is on the...

06:01.447 --> 06:03.212
Yeah, da Vinci's war machines.

06:03.577 --> 06:04.980
Sorry, but you're too late.

06:05.020 --> 06:07.048
I'm already under contract
to the football team.

06:07.082 --> 06:09.190
So? You can still help me out, buddy.

06:09.301 --> 06:12.001
No, I can't.
It's exclusive this year.

06:18.287 --> 06:19.332
New counselor?

06:19.452 --> 06:21.236
Yeah.
Mr. Molina.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.611
Mister?
Well, what's your first name?

06:23.857 --> 06:24.874
My first name?

06:24.994 --> 06:28.927
Well, you don't think anyone around here
is gonna call you Mr. Molina, do you?

06:29.435 --> 06:31.077
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.716
- Well, good luck with that.
- Thanks.

06:37.079 --> 06:39.877
Are, condoms still available
through your office?

06:40.584 --> 06:41.232
No.

06:41.377 --> 06:42.431
Yes, they are.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.323
I hate that guy.

06:49.744 --> 06:52.380
I hate him. Look at him.
Now he's hitting on her.

06:55.533 --> 06:57.624
Why are you so obsessed
with Grace Bowman?

06:59.546 --> 07:01.593
OK, why are you so
obsessed with Grace Bowman?

07:02.350 --> 07:04.695
Because she's Grace Bowman.
She's a goddess.

07:04.736 --> 07:06.710
She's not a goddess. She's a Christian.

07:06.774 --> 07:08.233
You are not a Christian.

07:08.308 --> 07:10.761
I would become a Christian
if I could have Grace Bowman.

07:11.454 --> 07:13.132
If by "have," you mean

07:13.547 --> 07:16.324
have sex with, that would be impossible.
She doesn't have sex.

07:16.364 --> 07:19.030
She's not gonna have sex until
she's married. Especially with you.

07:20.237 --> 07:22.548
Or you.
Even if you became a Christian.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.338
Why wouldn't she have sex
with me even if I became a Christian?

07:25.396 --> 07:27.382
'Cause you're you,
and she's Grace Bowman.

07:27.449 --> 07:28.902
She's a goddess.

07:29.262 --> 07:32.829
What are my chances with someone who's
not gonna wait until they get married?

07:33.136 --> 07:35.253
25% percent of guys
your age are having sex.

07:35.294 --> 07:35.983
Guys?

07:36.186 --> 07:38.687
- He's a guy, isn't he?
- He's not looking for a guy.

07:38.807 --> 07:40.611
What do you know about 15-year-old...

07:42.132 --> 07:42.932
gals?

07:43.218 --> 07:46.515
20%, and I appreciate your
obvious avoidance of the word "girls."

07:46.798 --> 07:47.886
That's encouraging.

07:48.244 --> 07:49.471
Maybe. Not.

07:49.591 --> 07:52.085
29% percent of sexually active
15- to 17-year-old girls

07:52.124 --> 07:53.867
have partners three to five years older.

07:53.908 --> 07:56.284
All right,
well, I've gotta start somewhere.

07:56.654 --> 07:58.337
Where do you think I should start?

08:02.905 --> 08:03.979
Maybe there.

08:08.799 --> 08:10.541
She's kinda cute.
Who is that?

08:10.744 --> 08:13.332
Her name is Amy. She plays French horn.
She's in the band.

08:13.365 --> 08:16.325
She's smart, she's nice. She might
be desperate enough to go out with you.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.381
No one's that desperate.
You wanna bet?

08:18.509 --> 08:20.812
- Why does it have to be a bet?
- Why not?

08:20.883 --> 08:23.356
'Cause, one, you always lose,
and, two, it objectifies Amy,

08:23.418 --> 08:24.990
who's a person, not a horse.

08:25.043 --> 08:28.430
Three, because winning is an obsession
with Ben, and he will stop at nothing.

08:29.746 --> 08:30.983
<i>It's a bet.</i>

08:31.234 --> 08:34.010
You have to give us something
more than one night at band camp.

08:34.131 --> 08:36.905
- It was nothing.
- OK, by "nothing," you mean what?

08:37.337 --> 08:39.142
It was... not that great.

08:39.285 --> 08:41.121
And by "not that great,"
you mean...?

08:41.183 --> 08:43.143
I'm not even sure it was sex, OK, guys?

08:43.366 --> 08:44.143
Why not?

08:44.283 --> 08:46.513
I didn't exactly realize
what was happening

08:46.562 --> 08:48.640
until after two seconds,
and then it was over.

08:48.866 --> 08:51.492
It wasn't fun and definitely
not like what you see in the movies.

08:51.537 --> 08:53.565
You know, all romantic and stuff?

08:53.603 --> 08:55.000
Maybe it wasn't sex.

08:55.120 --> 08:58.184
Maybe you just had, like,
a really bad dream,

08:58.375 --> 09:00.237
and you just think you had sex?

09:00.646 --> 09:03.058
Yeah. Or maybe it was just
a really bad guy

09:03.098 --> 09:05.794
that she had really bad sex with.
Come on, who was it?

09:06.107 --> 09:08.943
He doesn't go to this school.
It was just some guy at band camp.

09:16.266 --> 09:18.618
I just.
I can't believe you didn't tell us.

09:19.537 --> 09:20.672
Telling you now.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.945
Yeah, well, whyareyou telling us now?

09:34.702 --> 09:35.512
No.

09:36.245 --> 09:37.786
Amy, you're not.

09:38.070 --> 09:39.807
That's the second bell.
I have to go.

09:39.927 --> 09:42.256
- We can't just go to class now.
- Well, I have to.

09:42.297 --> 09:46.270
I have to, too. I'm in enough trouble
as it is without skipping class.

09:47.642 --> 09:48.912
I have to go.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.356
- Hi. I was watching you...
- Hi.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.472
I'm happy you're so interested
in the Youth Fellowship programs,

10:04.492 --> 10:06.483
but I'm afraid you've
made me late for class.

10:07.070 --> 10:09.396
So you owe me.
I'm expecting to see you and Adrian

10:09.437 --> 10:11.849
both there tomorrow night
with all of your friends.

10:16.606 --> 10:18.004
Hi, I'm Grace.

10:18.268 --> 10:18.930
Hi.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.489
Hi. I was just wondering
if you were going to the game.

10:21.529 --> 10:23.304
We're having a party
at our church after,

10:23.344 --> 10:25.432
and I would love if you could come.

10:34.828 --> 10:36.054
Hey, you.

10:38.964 --> 10:41.133
It's... Amy, right?

10:44.982 --> 10:46.807
I'm just messin'with you, kid.

10:47.531 --> 10:50.552
You don't think I could ever
forget the night we spent together

10:50.794 --> 10:52.254
at band camp, do ya?

11:18.276 --> 11:19.979
Get out!
I'm gonna puke.

11:22.467 --> 11:24.190
<i>Come on, let's get out of here.</i>

11:33.329 --> 11:35.903
I think I broke the
school record for the mile.

11:36.094 --> 11:39.499
I ran all the way to the grocery
store and back in 15 minutes,

11:39.627 --> 11:41.068
and that is counting the weird,

11:41.113 --> 11:43.723
awkward stare I got from the
old lady that rung all that stuff up.

11:43.763 --> 11:45.329
Why are you two taking a test?

11:45.367 --> 11:46.563
They're for you.

11:46.617 --> 11:49.482
I hope you drank enough water.
Don't use it all on the first one.

11:49.599 --> 11:51.261
We wanna make absolutely sure.

11:51.403 --> 11:54.939
I think the only way to be absolutely
sure is if you go see a doctor.

11:55.021 --> 11:58.082
I don't have that kind of doctor.
All I have is a pediatrician.

12:02.569 --> 12:04.232
Do you guys mind?

12:06.522 --> 12:07.555
Here you go.

12:14.030 --> 12:15.105
Thank you.

12:15.327 --> 12:16.604
<i>Welcome.</i>

12:29.129 --> 12:31.055
- Here you go.
- Thanks, hon.

12:31.419 --> 12:34.249
What's that ring? I never
noticed you had a ring like that.

12:34.891 --> 12:37.655
It's a promise ring.
My parents gave it to me when I promised

12:37.679 --> 12:39.787
them I wouldn't have sex
until I get married.

12:41.987 --> 12:45.169
I know what a promise ring is. I...
I just didn't know you had one.

12:45.511 --> 12:46.545
Last night.

12:46.697 --> 12:48.866
My parents and I had
a long talk about you and me.

12:49.056 --> 12:51.347
But I thought your parents
were happy we were dating.

12:51.486 --> 12:53.047
I thought they trusted me.

12:53.153 --> 12:54.349
I'm a Christian.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.608
I'm just as committed
to abstinence as you are.

12:57.218 --> 13:00.724
Besides, sexual purity in or out
of marriage isn't a one-time vow, Grace.

13:00.843 --> 13:03.437
It's a daily recommitment
to God and his plan for us.

13:03.498 --> 13:05.968
I know that and my parents know that.

13:06.029 --> 13:08.553
And they're happy we're dating
and I'm happy we're dating, because

13:08.593 --> 13:11.583
you are a Christian, and we
do share a commitment to our faith.

13:11.725 --> 13:14.279
That's why I had no problem
making a promise to them.

13:16.650 --> 13:18.494
When do you think we'll get married?

13:18.646 --> 13:20.278
If we do get married,

13:20.429 --> 13:22.143
and someday I do hope to marry you,

13:22.399 --> 13:24.061
in case I never said that. I...

13:24.493 --> 13:27.222
I do hope to marry you,
you know, someday.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.947
Well, I'm 15, you're 16.

13:30.095 --> 13:31.737
I think it's gonna be a while.

13:31.860 --> 13:34.901
I've got high school and college
and I hope medical school.

13:38.444 --> 13:40.613
How long is medical school, exactly?

13:40.730 --> 13:43.642
What difference does it make?
True love waits.

13:48.158 --> 13:51.219
But you don't have to be out of medical
school before you get married, right?

13:51.260 --> 13:53.854
I mean, you can get married before
medical school, before college, even.

13:53.895 --> 13:56.996
Jack, we've talked about this before,
lots of times.

13:57.220 --> 13:59.693
I wanna be out of medical
school before I get married.

13:59.753 --> 14:03.402
My dad waited till he was out of medical
school, and my mom waited with him.

14:05.526 --> 14:06.763
OK, I know.

14:07.177 --> 14:08.483
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.192
I'm fine.

14:13.073 --> 14:15.142
Hypothetically speaking, and

14:15.913 --> 14:17.616
not that I'd even be interested in this.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.754
I don't even know
if it's a sinafter marriage.

14:19.876 --> 14:22.113
But I have heard that
some people have found that...

14:22.649 --> 14:24.088
Excuse me if this sounds vulgar,

14:24.118 --> 14:26.459
but we have the relationship
where I respect you,

14:26.499 --> 14:28.810
you respect me.
We can tell each other anything, right?

14:28.850 --> 14:30.993
Right, so just say what you wanna say.

14:31.884 --> 14:32.857
All right.

14:35.264 --> 14:38.305
Is oral sex allowed before marriage?

14:38.341 --> 14:40.551
I mean, if two people
are committed to one another

14:40.671 --> 14:43.681
and in love with each other,
would that be allowed?

14:44.946 --> 14:46.081
I don't know.

14:46.492 --> 14:48.042
I'll ask my mother.

14:48.479 --> 14:50.912
I'm kidding.
Kidding.

14:51.229 --> 14:52.546
But you deserve that.

14:52.961 --> 14:54.461
Of course it's sex,

14:55.019 --> 14:58.241
and you need to keep your mind away
from those kinds of thoughts, Jack.

14:58.302 --> 15:01.228
- I mean, what is wrong with you today?
- I don't know. Just...

15:01.350 --> 15:02.862
This ring, it just.

15:03.252 --> 15:05.097
I don't know.
It made me think about things.

15:05.166 --> 15:07.753
And you know when you tell
yourself not to think about something,

15:07.799 --> 15:09.981
and you just cannot stop
thinking about that something?

15:10.111 --> 15:11.347
It's called willpower.

15:11.481 --> 15:14.142
Pray I get some.
Pray I get lots of it.

15:14.451 --> 15:16.195
Grace,
I love you,

15:16.681 --> 15:19.274
and you are the most
beautiful girl in the world, and

15:19.342 --> 15:21.572
and I'm not saying
I wanna do anything right now,

15:22.604 --> 15:24.611
but waiting till you're out
of medical school?

15:24.642 --> 15:26.122
You are gonna be fine.

15:26.230 --> 15:27.837
We're gonna be fine.

15:28.181 --> 15:30.715
We're gonna save what's meant
for marriage, for marriage,

15:31.614 --> 15:35.376
and with the help of our lord and savior
Jesus Christ, we'll make it, Jack,

15:35.604 --> 15:38.655
through high school and through
college and through medical school.

15:41.639 --> 15:42.990
I love you.

15:48.900 --> 15:49.894
Hello.

15:50.847 --> 15:52.870
Hello, Jesus freaks.

15:54.437 --> 15:56.323
Are you done here?
I need a place tosit.

15:56.429 --> 15:58.973
Sure. Please, sit down.
We were just leaving.

16:01.304 --> 16:03.879
I... think I'm just gonna stay here
for a minute.

16:05.577 --> 16:08.637
But convince Adrian to come
to our church party after the game.

16:08.756 --> 16:10.581
- It's Adrian, right?
- Yeah.

16:18.327 --> 16:20.415
I overheard a little of that.

16:21.484 --> 16:24.505
So, you two, you don't...

16:29.239 --> 16:30.475
Interesting.

16:45.435 --> 16:47.842
I just want in the band.
I love music.

16:47.930 --> 16:51.640
I've always wanted to play an
instrument. Those uniforms are insane.

16:51.782 --> 16:52.937
Those epaulets?

16:53.034 --> 16:54.473
Who came up with those?

16:54.516 --> 16:56.584
You're not trying to
get out of gym, are you?

16:56.762 --> 16:59.488
Gym? I would get of
gym if I joined the band?

16:59.533 --> 17:01.073
Does one have to do with the other?

17:01.094 --> 17:03.147
Both are considered physical activity.

17:03.743 --> 17:05.811
Well, I know some students
in the band who are

17:05.851 --> 17:07.838
engaging in a lot of physical activity.

17:08.223 --> 17:09.259
The drummer.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.518
Others, not so much.

17:12.407 --> 17:14.351
Never mind.
Just sign me up.

17:16.307 --> 17:17.848
You know, Ben,

17:18.127 --> 17:19.547
I think it's very admirable

17:19.587 --> 17:22.161
that you'd like to learn
to play a musical instrument.

17:22.384 --> 17:25.653
However,
I think you're lying about your motive.

17:26.258 --> 17:29.562
I think you want in the band for some
other reason than your love of music.

17:29.639 --> 17:32.436
What?
Ha. Lying?

17:32.951 --> 17:36.113
Mark, we've gotta talk.
You're the counselor.

17:36.219 --> 17:40.030
You're new here,
and obviously you're new at the job.

17:40.117 --> 17:41.333
Am I right?

17:41.541 --> 17:44.000
According to my records,
you're new here, too.

17:44.041 --> 17:45.622
You're a freshman, right?

17:45.698 --> 17:47.940
Good research.
You're absolutely correct.

17:48.227 --> 17:50.086
Just tell me why you want in the band.

17:50.206 --> 17:52.571
I've been rejected
by the French horn player,

17:53.118 --> 17:54.456
a certain Amy...

17:55.012 --> 17:56.390
something or other.

17:56.510 --> 18:00.364
Therefore I've decided that I'm in love
with her and cannot live without her.

18:00.534 --> 18:03.230
Ergo, I must take up an
instrument and join the band.

18:03.409 --> 18:04.495
So what do ya say?

18:04.546 --> 18:06.579
Not that I don't relish the opportunity

18:06.620 --> 18:09.458
to climb the ropes and jump
over the horses in gym, but

18:10.309 --> 18:13.261
love calls, and
I must answer.

18:13.545 --> 18:16.773
So this whole thing
is motivated by rejection?

18:16.852 --> 18:19.016
To be perfectly honest, Mark, it's

18:19.467 --> 18:21.838
all motivated by the fact that I'm 15,

18:22.914 --> 18:23.968
I'm a virgin,

18:24.515 --> 18:27.535
and if I ever want to have a sex life,
I've gotta start somewhere.

18:28.143 --> 18:32.183
And my advisors have advised
that I start with this band chick.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.837
First-year band students...
beginners'band...

18:36.323 --> 18:38.026
is in a different class.

18:38.254 --> 18:41.363
It's not even in the
same period as marching band.

18:41.512 --> 18:44.743
So if Amy, the French horn player,
is already in band,

18:44.885 --> 18:47.520
a change in your schedule
is not gonna help you out.

18:47.621 --> 18:49.948
How long would it take
to learn to play the cymbal?

18:50.112 --> 18:53.851
I don't know, but I think it's
calledcymbals, and as easy as it looks,

18:53.943 --> 18:56.038
I would think you'd still have
to learn to read music

18:56.079 --> 18:57.863
so you'd know when
to smack 'em together.

18:57.910 --> 19:01.520
Fine. I. I'll do it. I'll learn how
to read music. How hard can it be?

19:01.648 --> 19:04.266
If Blind Lemon Jefferson can do it,
I can do it.

19:04.514 --> 19:07.311
Let's get that meeting
scheduled as soon as possible.

19:10.141 --> 19:11.766
Why do you even have to be in the band?

19:11.798 --> 19:13.967
Why can't you just call
this woman up and ask her out?

19:14.020 --> 19:17.618
Because, as you mentioned earlier,
now I kill two birds with one stone.

19:17.753 --> 19:20.679
I get a shot at the chick,
plus I get outta PE.

19:20.830 --> 19:24.276
Hey, but if you can take a compliment,
I think you're making progress.

19:24.428 --> 19:26.414
I like the suggestion just to call her.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.151
Now, I'm not a phone guy,

19:28.232 --> 19:31.861
but I like that you'd suggest
something so practical and personal.

19:32.018 --> 19:33.761
You might just do well here.

19:34.154 --> 19:36.303
I'll find you after
I've set up the meeting.

19:36.786 --> 19:38.185
I'll look forward to it.

19:39.633 --> 19:42.106
- Could I have a condom?
- For what?

19:42.965 --> 19:45.306
You're gonna need to know
what a condom's for if you're

19:45.357 --> 19:47.360
gonna make it at this job, Mark.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.399
Get outta my office.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.142
I'll find the band director.

20:00.037 --> 20:01.274
Life stinks.

20:02.222 --> 20:05.081
Well, it's kinda funny
considering we're in a bathroom.

20:07.334 --> 20:09.273
Well, what are we gonna do?

20:09.549 --> 20:10.299
We?

20:10.355 --> 20:12.481
Amy, we're in this with you.

20:12.802 --> 20:15.951
We're there for you, and anything
you want us to do, we'll do it.

20:16.129 --> 20:18.152
Yeah. Just...
what do you want us to do?

20:18.339 --> 20:21.194
I don't think there's anything
anybody can do, Madison.

20:21.673 --> 20:23.862
I mean, I'm the one who's pregnant.

20:25.063 --> 20:26.272
My God.

20:27.409 --> 20:30.307
Can't believe I'm old enough
to use the word "pregnant"

20:30.550 --> 20:33.246
in a sentence,
much less actually be pregnant.

20:35.830 --> 20:36.641
Jeez.

20:36.884 --> 20:40.045
OK, look. I'm just gonna say this one
more time, and then I'll shut up.

20:40.167 --> 20:41.884
I think you should see a doctor,

20:41.922 --> 20:44.213
because that's what
it says on all three tests,

20:44.224 --> 20:45.643
to see a doctor.

20:45.683 --> 20:48.185
Yeah, well, maybe doctors
make them put that on the box

20:48.274 --> 20:50.483
so that they still get
paid for an office visit.

20:50.598 --> 20:53.529
Or maybe they put that on there
so you can come in early enough,

20:53.590 --> 20:55.196
so that way you have options.

20:55.419 --> 20:56.868
- Options?
- Well, I mean,

20:56.910 --> 20:59.587
if you don't really wanna
have a baby at 15.

20:59.639 --> 21:01.966
You better not be suggesting
she get an abortion.

21:02.086 --> 21:03.563
I'm not suggesting anything.

21:03.632 --> 21:05.797
I just think you should see a doctor.

21:05.939 --> 21:09.959
And I would go to a doctor
before you go to whoever this guy is.

21:10.377 --> 21:13.235
There may be something else wrong
with you that's making you test positive

21:13.276 --> 21:15.465
for pregnancy even
though you're not pregnant.

21:15.505 --> 21:18.226
Like the monkey pox
or a flesh-eating virus.

21:18.261 --> 21:19.538
That would be a relief.

21:19.584 --> 21:20.861
No, no, no, it would.

21:20.963 --> 21:22.954
She's right.
I'm calling my doctor.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.693
You're calling? Don't you
think your mother should do that?

21:25.734 --> 21:27.882
You don't think I'm telling
my mother about this do you?

21:27.913 --> 21:30.482
You have to.
Either you're sick or you're pregnant.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.527
- She's gonna find out sooner or later.
- Why?

21:32.587 --> 21:35.578
Because,
she'll either die or have a baby.

21:35.741 --> 21:39.091
And I hate to point this out, but
somebody's gotta get that doctor bill.

21:39.277 --> 21:41.203
No, they'll just bill
it to the insurance.

21:41.380 --> 21:43.047
Your parents will see the insurance.

21:44.258 --> 21:47.186
Wait. What if you tell your parents that

21:47.252 --> 21:49.868
you had to write a paper at school
about some woman that you admire,

21:49.929 --> 21:52.118
the only person you could
think of was your pediatrician?

21:52.164 --> 21:54.638
Since she hadn't seen you in so long,

21:54.698 --> 21:57.493
she went ahead and gave you
a checkup while you guys talked.

21:58.242 --> 21:59.010
Yeah.

21:59.365 --> 22:00.095
Yeah.

22:00.169 --> 22:01.345
It's a good idea,

22:01.730 --> 22:03.055
except it's a lie.

22:03.136 --> 22:06.076
OK, would you stop freaking her out, OK?
She's a woman doctor.

22:06.148 --> 22:08.166
She's gonna help her.
She'll understand.

22:08.221 --> 22:09.878
Yeah,
maybe.

22:10.020 --> 22:12.338
Look, I'll go with you.
We'll go right after school.

22:13.214 --> 22:14.171
Sshoot.

22:14.636 --> 22:16.623
I have yearbook
staff right after school.

22:17.025 --> 22:18.968
Did I tell you I got
on the yearbook staff?

22:19.022 --> 22:21.724
No, but congratulations.

22:22.001 --> 22:23.379
I can go after ballet.

22:23.514 --> 22:25.438
It's OK. I'll go by myself.

22:25.783 --> 22:27.810
I should probably go alone.

22:29.383 --> 22:30.620
All right.

24:03.615 --> 24:06.776
Why do these people think there's
something wrong with a belly button?

24:07.486 --> 24:09.736
It's not like everyone doesn't have one.

24:10.548 --> 24:13.720
I mean, I have one,
they have one, you have one.

24:13.852 --> 24:16.141
Personally,
I don't see the big deal if it shows.

24:16.182 --> 24:18.420
It's not like anyone else
is covering their buttons.

24:18.552 --> 24:20.704
They're supposed to.
It's in the dress code.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.468
Yes, Mother, but no one
pays attention to the dress code.

24:23.698 --> 24:26.696
Not until today, when I get
hauled into the principal's office

24:26.737 --> 24:28.399
and asked to put on a sweatshirt.

24:28.519 --> 24:30.888
Why should I follow the
rules if no one else does?

24:31.119 --> 24:32.335
I'll tell you why.

24:33.941 --> 24:35.542
I don't wanna get another call from

24:35.583 --> 24:37.616
the principal's office and
neither does your mother.

24:37.657 --> 24:39.056
We don't like being embarrassed

24:39.076 --> 24:41.751
by our 13-year-old daughter who
insists on dressing like a streetwalker

24:41.852 --> 24:43.271
we take our hard-earned money

24:43.335 --> 24:46.106
to buy you decent clothes
that meet the dress code requirement.

24:46.490 --> 24:48.902
Forget the school dress code.
We have our own dress code.

24:49.031 --> 24:52.201
Didn't just break the school's rules you
broke our rules, rules of good taste.

24:52.382 --> 24:55.341
What are you trying to prove,
that you're not 13? You're 13.

24:55.561 --> 24:57.706
That you're sexy?
You're not sexy.

24:59.057 --> 25:00.456
Do you know what sexy means?

25:00.268 --> 25:03.531
It means you're ready to have sex,
and you are not ready to have sex.

25:03.609 --> 25:05.454
Neither of my daughters
are ready to have sex,

25:05.474 --> 25:08.068
and you two will not be
ready to have sex for a long time.

25:08.390 --> 25:09.545
A long, long time.

25:12.738 --> 25:14.765
Maybe after you've been
married a couple years.

25:14.805 --> 25:16.853
Wanna make sure it's
gonna work out first.

25:17.029 --> 25:18.063
Heh, funny.

25:18.569 --> 25:19.436
Am I right?

25:20.470 --> 25:21.424
He's right,

25:22.071 --> 25:25.608
although I doubt you get your father's
permission even after you're married.

25:30.357 --> 25:31.323
You're right.

25:31.476 --> 25:32.713
Right about what?

25:32.750 --> 25:35.041
Showing my bellybutton
means I wanna have sex?

25:35.463 --> 25:38.078
Do you have to be such a
geek and ruin everything for me?

25:38.334 --> 25:41.092
Hey, your sister's not a geek,
she's a nice girl, and you know what?

25:41.151 --> 25:42.854
Boys like nice girls,

25:42.975 --> 25:45.732
so why don't you start trying
to look a little nicer

25:45.914 --> 25:47.192
and be a little nicer.

25:52.393 --> 25:53.913
Amy, are you feeling OK?

25:54.456 --> 25:55.794
You don't look well.

25:55.855 --> 25:59.100
Yeah. No, I'm fine.
I'm just a little tired.

26:08.417 --> 26:10.546
Bless this time we
have together as a family

26:10.586 --> 26:12.507
and know we are grateful for each other.

26:12.567 --> 26:14.371
Thank you for your
many blessings and let us

26:14.412 --> 26:16.094
always remember to share with others,

26:16.155 --> 26:19.684
giving the same love and respect to
everyone that we'd give to one another.

26:19.798 --> 26:20.509
Amen.

26:20.704 --> 26:21.717
<i>Amen.</i>

26:22.854 --> 26:24.922
- Thanks for dinner, Mom.
- Thanks for dinner, Mommy.

26:24.982 --> 26:27.280
- Thanks for dinner, baby.
- You are welcome.

26:28.300 --> 26:30.023
How'd it go at school today, Grace?

26:30.084 --> 26:31.818
Youth fellowship party.
Any takers?

26:31.858 --> 26:34.329
No one said they'll definitely come,
but I think they will.

26:34.512 --> 26:36.478
Am I going to the party?

26:36.717 --> 26:39.239
Your mom and I aren't
even invited to the party, Tom,

26:39.300 --> 26:40.780
so I tell you what we're gonna do.

26:40.820 --> 26:43.253
We're gonna go to the game,
stop by and rent a video,

26:43.421 --> 26:45.327
and then we'll hang
out here all night tomorrow.

26:45.367 --> 26:46.938
That's right. We'll get some popcorn,

26:46.939 --> 26:49.299
maybe even I'll make your favorite
brownies. How's that?

26:49.360 --> 26:50.482
That's OK.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.103
I wanna go to the party.

26:52.863 --> 26:54.404
I think you should go, Tom.

26:54.460 --> 26:55.839
The party's for everyone.

26:56.361 --> 26:58.605
You can ride over with Jack and me.
Jack won't mind.

26:58.807 --> 26:59.962
He might mind.

27:00.368 --> 27:03.611
Besides, I don't think we'd displaying
the trust we have in you if

27:03.672 --> 27:06.084
we make your older brother
your chaperone for the evening.

27:06.129 --> 27:08.277
I do make a good chaperone.

27:09.963 --> 27:11.971
Yes, but she does not need a chaperone.

27:12.290 --> 27:14.920
Your sister made a promise,
and we know she intends to keep it.

27:15.022 --> 27:16.907
Why does she need a ring?

27:17.082 --> 27:20.386
She needs a ring to remind other
people that she made that promise.

27:20.495 --> 27:21.387
Like Jack?

27:21.541 --> 27:23.041
It's not about Jack.

27:23.442 --> 27:27.050
No. This is about all boys,
including Jack.

27:30.372 --> 27:33.190
Tom, why don't you go to
the party for a little while,

27:33.260 --> 27:36.047
then your mom and I will pick you
up afterwards. What do you say?

27:36.128 --> 27:38.942
- Better than nothin'.
- Yeah, better than nothin'.

27:44.561 --> 27:48.276
Sooner or later, I think you're gonna
tell me why these sexual conquests

27:48.459 --> 27:49.767
make you feel like a man,

27:50.518 --> 27:52.441
because I know you know why you do this,

27:52.482 --> 27:54.468
and I know you know it's not gonna help.

27:58.289 --> 28:00.803
We go down this road
every week,

28:01.228 --> 28:02.627
and then we hit a brick wall.

28:05.396 --> 28:06.490
Having sex

28:06.622 --> 28:09.906
with as many women as you can
is not gonna make you feel any better,

28:10.456 --> 28:12.381
and I think it's making you feel worse.

28:12.462 --> 28:15.117
Aren't I supposed
to tell you how I feel?

28:16.132 --> 28:18.969
You been coming here enough years
to know I'm not that kind of shrink.

28:21.298 --> 28:22.272
Come on,

28:22.879 --> 28:24.197
tell me how you feel.

28:25.477 --> 28:26.835
I feel like my...

28:28.743 --> 28:31.104
my frickin'father stole my childhood and

28:31.165 --> 28:34.307
dumped me in another family and said,
"You take him. I don't want him.

28:34.575 --> 28:36.035
He's damaged goods."

28:37.120 --> 28:38.762
I like the way you started out,

28:39.582 --> 28:41.619
although I'd love to
hear a little more anger

28:41.660 --> 28:43.869
in your voice,
because you have a right

28:44.264 --> 28:45.420
to be angry,

28:46.069 --> 28:49.555
because your father did steal
your childhood by sexually abusing you,

28:50.059 --> 28:52.431
but he didn't dump you anywhere.

28:52.838 --> 28:55.900
Gigantic hand of social services

28:56.020 --> 28:59.517
reached down and
plucked you out of a deplorable

28:59.871 --> 29:03.812
situation and placed you in a family
that doesn't see the damage.

29:04.201 --> 29:06.492
They see the potential,
and hey love you,

29:06.998 --> 29:09.228
and I know
you love them.

29:10.087 --> 29:13.939
But it's the loving yourself
I'm trying to get you to come around to.

29:13.979 --> 29:16.997
I thought you were trying to get me
to come around to not having sex

29:17.134 --> 29:18.406
with every girl I meet.

29:18.441 --> 29:20.691
Can you see how these
two things are related?

29:20.915 --> 29:23.347
Can you see how you're
constantly fighting to prove

29:23.388 --> 29:26.732
your masculinity all because
your father was some sick bastard?

29:27.422 --> 29:30.320
Can you see how you have
it within your power

29:30.482 --> 29:32.713
to not let what he did have anything

29:32.774 --> 29:36.564
to do with who you are
at this point in your life?

29:37.861 --> 29:40.770
I'm not sure I wanna see it.
How do you feel about that?

29:42.574 --> 29:43.648
I feel...

29:45.264 --> 29:47.676
like you don't wanna see it,
because you think if you do,

29:47.737 --> 29:49.784
you'll lose your otivation
for having sex.

29:49.845 --> 29:52.485
Without constant indiscriminate sex,

29:53.066 --> 29:55.119
you'll be a new person,
a better person,

29:55.240 --> 29:58.382
a person you might actually like,
even love.

29:58.887 --> 30:01.985
I got some bad news.
I love myself constantly

30:02.371 --> 30:04.439
and indiscriminately, too.

30:05.611 --> 30:08.712
And worse news our time is up,
and I got a date.

30:09.158 --> 30:11.351
No.
You were late.

30:12.130 --> 30:13.529
You have ten more minutes.

30:35.401 --> 30:36.401
Hi, Ricky.

30:37.819 --> 30:38.583
Jack.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.912
Yeah, I know who you are.

30:40.972 --> 30:43.377
The guy that's not having
sex with his girlfriend.

30:43.754 --> 30:45.052
What can I do for you?

30:48.329 --> 30:50.776
Yeah, that's still sex.

30:55.233 --> 30:57.137
I told you not to make a bet with him.

30:57.178 --> 30:59.266
You really think it's gonna
be so difficult to get Amy

30:59.286 --> 31:01.252
to go out with you that
you have to join the band?

31:01.297 --> 31:03.102
One she probably go out with me anyway.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.935
Bt this way, I look like I'm the kind
of guy who'd probably do anything

31:05.967 --> 31:08.764
for a dame, and two,
it gets me out of gym.

31:08.819 --> 31:10.664
And three she may
think you're stalking her,

31:10.704 --> 31:13.542
which may seem romantic to you,
terrifying to her.

31:13.737 --> 31:17.505
Four don't use "dame" outside your
close circle of friends, which is us.

31:17.566 --> 31:19.188
Come on, call her.

31:19.324 --> 31:21.797
I'll call her.
I don't wanna call too early.

31:21.837 --> 31:24.179
I don't wanna look too anxious.
Dames don't like that.

31:27.104 --> 31:28.838
What time's the game
start tomorrow night?

31:28.867 --> 31:30.109
Seven. Home field.

31:30.144 --> 31:32.131
Good. I won't have to leave work early.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.799
You don't have to go.

31:35.087 --> 31:36.445
Of course we're going.

31:36.465 --> 31:39.161
We're not gonna miss seeing you march
in your first high-school halftime.

31:39.216 --> 31:42.402
Thought you didn't like marching bands,
and you hate football.

31:42.642 --> 31:45.016
- But I love you.
- I don't have to go, do I?

31:45.277 --> 31:45.989
Yes.

31:47.656 --> 31:49.368
Can I talk to the two of you alone?

31:51.048 --> 31:53.217
You have to talk to
them alone about something?

31:53.557 --> 31:55.332
Like what? Finally decide to wear a bra?

31:56.469 --> 31:58.985
Ashley, why don't you get that?
It's probably for you.

32:02.214 --> 32:04.091
Must be serious.
She's sitting down.

32:06.969 --> 32:08.570
Why the long face, sweetheart?

32:08.696 --> 32:10.663
For you. It's a guy.

32:12.104 --> 32:15.286
You have a boyfriend?
Is that what you're trying to tell us?

32:17.116 --> 32:20.247
- Hello?
- George, give her some privacy.

32:21.658 --> 32:23.912
See, I told ya.
Boys like nice girls.

32:24.033 --> 32:25.147
Come on.

32:26.690 --> 32:27.623
Ben?

32:28.270 --> 32:30.419
No. No, I'm sorry.

32:30.486 --> 32:32.067
I don't remember.

32:35.774 --> 32:38.148
Father, forgive us for our many sins,

32:38.527 --> 32:41.932
for not being strong when
temptation leads us astray.

32:42.625 --> 32:44.449
Give us the strength to do thy will,

32:44.958 --> 32:48.546
especially when it's much easier to
give in to the pleasures of the flesh.

32:49.269 --> 32:51.620
Let us not be distracted
by the women who are here

32:51.762 --> 32:54.600
to lead us into situations
that would lead us straight into hell

32:54.640 --> 32:58.564
and destroy our souls forever,
but to cheer us on to victory.

32:59.662 --> 33:00.656
Their...

33:00.776 --> 33:02.480
short skirts,

33:02.600 --> 33:04.851
tight sweaters and

33:05.212 --> 33:06.408
hot bodies.

33:06.448 --> 33:08.874
Say something about
winning and make it snappy!

33:08.980 --> 33:11.259
Yes. Help us focus on our game,

33:11.379 --> 33:14.647
though difficult that may be,
and lead us into victory.

33:14.688 --> 33:15.678
Amen!

33:27.044 --> 33:28.697
<i>1- we are the Lancers.</i>

33:28.821 --> 33:32.065
<i>2- a little bit louder.
3- I still can't hear you.</i>

33:32.211 --> 33:34.132
<i>More, more, more, more.</i>

33:36.333 --> 33:38.624
You should go. You're great.

33:41.158 --> 33:42.496
So are you.

34:41.768 --> 34:43.228
Sure you don't want anything?

34:43.329 --> 34:44.402
No, thank you.

34:45.054 --> 34:46.859
Thanks for coming out with me tonight.

34:47.771 --> 34:49.248
My dad's quite the driver?

34:49.697 --> 34:51.456
I've been training him to keep his eyes

34:51.514 --> 34:54.348
off the rear-view mirror
so we could have a little privacy.

34:55.259 --> 34:57.022
This is kinda my first date.

34:57.301 --> 34:59.733
Yeah, it's kinda my first date, too.

35:00.711 --> 35:02.150
I don't like what I'm hearing.

35:04.791 --> 35:06.129
What are you hearing?

35:06.226 --> 35:07.618
Idiots falling in love.

35:08.042 --> 35:09.258
- Ben?
- Yes, Ben.

35:09.299 --> 35:11.596
- One the first date?
- Yes, on the first date.

35:12.419 --> 35:14.977
How often does that happen?

35:15.102 --> 35:19.062
I think the technical term is...
once in a blue moon.

35:19.786 --> 35:21.165
You seem a little nervous.

35:21.328 --> 35:22.677
Am I making you nervous

35:22.737 --> 35:25.444
with all my nervousness,
because I'm nervous.

35:25.559 --> 35:27.814
No, no, I'm OK.
Really.

35:27.996 --> 35:30.955
I think so, too.
You're OK, Amy Juergens.

35:31.648 --> 35:32.823
Even more than OK.

35:33.156 --> 35:34.347
You're good looking.

35:34.408 --> 35:36.416
You gotta be smart
to play that French horn.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.321
- How long you been playing that thing?
- Third grade.

35:39.557 --> 35:40.682
Why French horn?

35:40.990 --> 35:44.274
I don't know. I guess
I was too small to carry the tuba?

35:46.332 --> 35:47.568
Funny, too.

35:48.412 --> 35:49.669
What a dame.

35:50.102 --> 35:50.994
Dame?

35:57.260 --> 35:59.793
Will you excuse me, just for a sec?

36:10.475 --> 36:12.539
- How's it going?
- What are you guys doing here?

36:12.580 --> 36:14.495
What do you think
we're doing here?

36:14.535 --> 36:16.025
We're spying on you.

36:16.425 --> 36:19.304
- So?
- So this is a really stupid idea.

36:19.677 --> 36:21.785
- Why?
- Because I'm pregnant.

36:23.854 --> 36:26.595
Not in the church...
gym.

36:27.659 --> 36:29.950
OK, so are you gonna
go out with him again?

36:30.841 --> 36:33.896
Until he finds out I'm pregnant, or
till my parents find out I'm pregnant,

36:33.937 --> 36:35.661
then he'll never wanna
take me out again,

36:35.680 --> 36:37.363
and I'll never be allowed to date again.

36:37.383 --> 36:39.333
OK. So, here's what we were thinking.

36:39.486 --> 36:41.868
Wait. You and Madison
were thinking the same thing?

36:42.030 --> 36:44.913
Yeah. Can you believe it?
It's because it's the perfect plan.

36:46.226 --> 36:48.769
You date Ben,
you get Ben to fall in love with you,

36:49.146 --> 36:50.533
then you have sex with Ben,

36:50.848 --> 36:53.909
then you tell Ben you're pregnant,
then you marry Ben.

36:53.970 --> 36:55.301
See? Problem solved.

36:55.530 --> 36:59.175
It's possible. You said he joined
the band to be with you, right?

36:59.225 --> 37:02.601
So obviously he already likes you,
and I checked him out.

37:02.683 --> 37:05.594
He's an only child,
and his family has money.

37:06.423 --> 37:07.356
So?

37:07.467 --> 37:09.230
So? What are your other choices?

37:17.233 --> 37:19.321
Why are you staring at the drummer?

37:21.010 --> 37:22.322
The drummer's in the band.

37:22.457 --> 37:25.457
Anybody who's in the band can go to...
band camp.

37:27.032 --> 37:27.944
No.

37:28.567 --> 37:31.862
No. Amy, not him.
Please, no.

37:35.761 --> 37:37.120
You better watch out.

37:37.333 --> 37:39.542
I think the drummer's looking
at your French horn player.

37:39.562 --> 37:42.772
He's the one who better watch out.
I'm taking over his territory.

37:42.867 --> 37:43.840
The majorette?

37:43.915 --> 37:45.435
The percussion section.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.466
I'm taking to the cymbals
like a duck to water.

37:47.518 --> 37:49.809
You think that's gonna
impress Amy enough to...

37:49.879 --> 37:51.910
Enough to...
fall in love with me.

37:52.084 --> 37:53.919
- So it's love you're after.
- Yeah.

37:54.369 --> 37:55.889
Kinda surprised myself.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.860
Should I take it to mean
you won't be needing a condom?

37:58.994 --> 38:00.879
Hey, save that talk for your office.

38:09.384 --> 38:10.963
It's the first date. Be cool.

38:11.084 --> 38:12.177
Be cool?

38:13.321 --> 38:14.253
I am cool.

38:15.730 --> 38:16.946
I hate that guy.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.749
No, he saw you staring at him.
Now he's coming over here.

38:22.788 --> 38:25.383
- Good, 'cause I'm gonna kill him.
- Madison, don't say anything.

38:25.441 --> 38:27.677
Don't you say anything, either.
Don't tell him.

38:27.717 --> 38:29.130
Just stick to the plan.

38:29.326 --> 38:32.033
Ben's more likely
to marry you than he is.

38:32.198 --> 38:35.644
And you do not wanna have
bad sex for the rest of your life.

38:35.787 --> 38:37.510
Hello, ladies.

38:42.443 --> 38:43.660
What's with them?

38:45.826 --> 38:48.684
So, Amy, was that
your date I saw you with?

38:51.410 --> 38:52.782
You like that guy?

38:54.906 --> 38:56.338
He's not your type.

39:02.055 --> 39:06.043
Head Do me a favor. Dance with Grace's
brother so I can dance with her?

39:06.829 --> 39:09.241
The only one Amy's dancing with is me.

39:10.634 --> 39:12.317
I'm surprised you dance,

39:12.524 --> 39:15.017
what with your having no sense
of rhythm and all.

39:15.553 --> 39:17.337
See ya at band practice.

39:20.366 --> 39:22.028
I think someone feels threatened.

39:24.371 --> 39:25.448
So, you dance?

39:26.114 --> 39:28.239
- not really.
- Either do I.

39:29.721 --> 39:31.099
How hard can it be?

39:38.209 --> 39:40.904
How many students
do you think are having sex?

39:41.654 --> 39:43.337
High-school students -

39:43.400 --> 39:45.136
46.8%.

39:46.218 --> 39:47.799
You sure know a lot about sex.

39:48.669 --> 39:50.189
Yeah, it's kind of a hobby.

39:51.660 --> 39:54.315
You been talking about
sex since the third grade.

39:54.422 --> 39:57.462
Wouldn't you rather
have a hobby of having sex?

39:57.987 --> 39:59.609
No, I'm fine just dancing.

40:19.739 --> 40:20.442
Yeah.

40:21.251 --> 40:24.211
Hey, Tom, why don't you check outside,
see if Mom and Dad are here yet.

40:38.644 --> 40:40.023
So where's your boyfriend?

40:40.301 --> 40:42.186
He stepped outside to get some air.

40:42.503 --> 40:43.719
Where's your girlfriend?

40:44.332 --> 40:45.663
Adrian? I don't know.

40:52.917 --> 40:53.890
Hi, Jack.

40:54.542 --> 40:55.738
Where have you been?

40:55.874 --> 40:57.576
I had to go home and change.

40:57.840 --> 41:00.222
You didn't think I was gonna
wear my majorette uniform, did you?

41:00.330 --> 41:02.340
- What'd you tell him?
- Who, Ricky?

41:02.487 --> 41:04.144
Yes, Ricky.
What'd you tell him?

41:04.296 --> 41:06.915
Nothing. I told him I got
tired of him waiting to call,

41:06.976 --> 41:09.442
- so I went to get something to eat.
- So you didn't tell him...

41:10.283 --> 41:13.708
- about us?
- Did you want me to?

41:15.256 --> 41:16.597
Look, it was a mistake.

41:17.504 --> 41:19.084
I don't know what I was thinking.

41:19.719 --> 41:21.288
- It was a sin.
- Please.

41:21.329 --> 41:23.498
You're not gonna get all
Christian on me now, are you?

41:23.545 --> 41:26.498
I am a Christian,
and I'm a man. I just

41:27.063 --> 41:29.754
don't know how to be both right now.
I'm lost.

41:30.544 --> 41:32.571
Well, you didn't look lost last night.

41:32.803 --> 41:35.175
Look, I am so sorry, Adrian.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.723
- I took advantage of you.
- OK, stop it.

41:38.088 --> 41:40.136
No one takes advantage of me.

41:41.073 --> 41:43.586
And no one does anything
they don't wanna do.

41:44.490 --> 41:45.641
Pray with me.

41:45.703 --> 41:47.466
Pray that God forgives us, because God

41:47.547 --> 41:49.655
does forgive us when
we do something wrong,

41:49.971 --> 41:51.856
even something as wrong as we did.

41:52.092 --> 41:54.476
- I don't think we did anything wrong.
- Please.

41:55.062 --> 41:58.630
God loves you. Even if you're
not a Christian, God loves you.

41:59.577 --> 42:00.520
Pray with me.

42:00.580 --> 42:02.891
Are you sure that's
what you really want, Jack?

42:04.028 --> 42:05.508
You want God to love you?

42:07.080 --> 42:11.013
Are you sure you don't want...
me to love you?

42:17.793 --> 42:20.225
<i>Grace! Grace!</i>

42:21.494 --> 42:22.545
Grace!

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
