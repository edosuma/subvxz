00:00.045 --> 00:01.583
I'll tell you one thing--
When the Unsullied

00:01.617 --> 00:03.434
make it to Westeros,
they're gonna annihilate people.

00:03.451 --> 00:04.776
Wait, wait, dude, hold up.

00:04.788 --> 00:06.397
- It's gonna be crazy.
- First of all, slow down.

00:06.415 --> 00:08.407
Second of all,
I'm not up to that yet.

00:08.430 --> 00:09.592
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, yeah.

00:09.627 --> 00:11.583
- I didn't know that.
- I will erase it.

00:11.815 --> 00:13.677
Ass is like da-dow, blizz-ow.
I'm like, "peace."

00:13.712 --> 00:15.110
You know what I'm saying?
Like--

00:15.144 --> 00:17.374
Jordan, right now--
like, right now-- you must listen

00:17.408 --> 00:20.302
to how this white dude
is talking to black people.

00:20.336 --> 00:22.399
Get out of my face
with yo Tommy Bahama ass.

00:22.431 --> 00:24.963
I'm trying to make
some big dough. I'm a DJ.

00:24.997 --> 00:26.330
- No, no.
- "I'm a DJ."

00:26.364 --> 00:28.397
I put that pussy
on the chain wax, son.

00:28.430 --> 00:29.562
He puts the pussy
on the chain--

00:29.596 --> 00:30.895
That's pathetic.
That's pathetic.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.395
What's up, girl?

00:32.427 --> 00:33.827
He's walking this way.
He's totally walking this way.

00:33.861 --> 00:35.060
Oh, no, I can't.
I can't. I can't.

00:35.094 --> 00:36.226
Just go with it, dude.
Just go with it.

00:36.260 --> 00:37.292
- Hey!
- I can't.

00:37.326 --> 00:38.757
(calmly)
Hey! how's it going?

00:38.792 --> 00:40.191
- Key and Peele, right?
- Good.

00:40.225 --> 00:42.522
So stoked you guys are here.
Thanks for coming out.

00:42.556 --> 00:44.487
You guys rock.
Awesome.

00:44.522 --> 00:48.519
Yo, Kevin,
Let me get some red vines!

00:50.120 --> 00:52.652

- Want to get out of here?
- Yep.

The news.

01:40.265 --> 01:42.965
Well, yes, we talk
about the news a lot.

01:42.999 --> 01:45.233
- The news is annoying to us.
- Right.

01:45.267 --> 01:47.968
The way that the news stations
are getting their news now

01:48.003 --> 01:49.435
is just basically
from the internet.

01:49.470 --> 01:51.436
Yeah, yeah, it's like
they're checking their iPads

01:51.471 --> 01:52.770
at the desk.

01:52.805 --> 01:55.171
Uh, next we will discuss
a new way

01:55.206 --> 01:57.772
to double your penis size...

01:57.806 --> 02:00.806
- (laughs)
- That is...

02:00.841 --> 02:02.407
My mom and I used to watch
the local news together.

02:02.441 --> 02:04.275
And if a guy came
on the news and said,

02:04.309 --> 02:06.008
"There was a carjacking
on Six Mile Road,"

02:06.043 --> 02:08.310
my mom would go, "Oh, please
be white, please be white."

02:08.342 --> 02:10.244
Mm-hmm.

02:10.277 --> 02:12.246
Then be like, "and we'll
be back with more news

02:12.280 --> 02:15.414
on the Nigerian Prince
who needs some money."

02:15.449 --> 02:17.316
(laughter)

02:17.349 --> 02:19.950
"But first...

02:19.984 --> 02:23.384
a car chase ensued
down on Eight Mile and, uh..."

02:23.419 --> 02:26.419
Oh, oh, let this one guy
be white, please.

02:26.454 --> 02:29.621
"where-- where he stole
a six-pack of Smirnoff Ice..."

02:29.656 --> 02:31.789
Might be white!
Might be white!

02:31.823 --> 02:34.357
Might be white!
(applause)

02:34.391 --> 02:36.792
(exhales deeply)
Might be white.

Good evening, St. Paul.

I'm Jamie Throneburg.

And I'm Marcy Whitchurch.

02:50.241 --> 02:52.308
Winter weather advisories
are in effect

02:52.342 --> 02:53.909
across Central Minnesota
tonight.

02:53.943 --> 02:56.311
With more on that,
weatherman Isaac Labuda.

02:56.345 --> 02:57.312
Isaac.

02:57.346 --> 02:58.513
Thanks, Marcy.

02:58.547 --> 03:00.948
A major system
is zipping across the region.

03:00.982 --> 03:03.149
Outside temp right now,
8 degrees,

03:03.184 --> 03:04.383
but it feels like 20 below.

03:04.418 --> 03:05.584
Jamie.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.185
Well, stay off the roads
if you can, folks.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.652
Lots of reports
of black ice.

03:08.687 --> 03:11.621
Ooh, you got to watch out
for that dangerous black ice.

03:11.655 --> 03:14.823
It's transparent and sneaky.
Hard to see black ice.

03:14.857 --> 03:16.224
That's right, Marcy.

03:16.259 --> 03:17.926
Keep your loved ones safe
and warn them

03:17.960 --> 03:19.527
to stay off the street
tonight

03:19.562 --> 03:22.463
because of menacing,
life-robbing black, black ice.

03:22.497 --> 03:24.497
Isaac.

03:27.167 --> 03:29.067
We have Channel 17's
field reporter,

03:29.101 --> 03:30.368
Darren Hepner, with more.

03:30.402 --> 03:31.368
Darren?

03:31.403 --> 03:34.837
Yeah...

03:34.872 --> 03:37.873
I'm standing out here
at historic Ramsey Hill,

03:37.908 --> 03:40.175
where there are currently
no cars on the street

03:40.209 --> 03:42.076
due to, uh...

03:42.111 --> 03:44.745
hazardous
driving conditions.

03:44.779 --> 03:47.347
Darren, are you
talking about black ice?

03:47.381 --> 03:48.848
That's right.

03:48.883 --> 03:50.516
Ooh, jeez,
it's frightening

03:50.550 --> 03:52.951
Just to even say
"black ice."

03:52.986 --> 03:55.821
It's scary, tricky,
ruthless stuff, that black ice.

03:55.855 --> 03:59.191
A perfectly safe neighborhood
can be suddenly terrorized

03:59.226 --> 04:00.860
by the appearance
of black ice.

04:00.894 --> 04:04.497
Well, one must
keep in mind that,

04:04.531 --> 04:07.300
just because black ice
looks different than white ice,

04:07.334 --> 04:09.502
it doesn't make it
any more dangerous.

04:09.537 --> 04:11.070
Also, one must remember

04:11.105 --> 04:14.607
how hard it is
for black ice to survive,

04:14.642 --> 04:16.976
what with the authorities
trying to destroy it

04:17.011 --> 04:19.144
with the snow plows
and salt trucks,

04:19.180 --> 04:21.781
but black ice perseveres.

04:21.815 --> 04:23.316
Uh-huh, that's right.
That's right.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.184
And as you can see
right now,

04:25.219 --> 04:26.318
the city
is being controlled

04:26.353 --> 04:28.954
by lots
of oppressive white snow,

04:28.988 --> 04:32.224
making it hard
for all people to advance.

04:32.259 --> 04:35.028
And we don't hear
much "news" about that,

04:35.062 --> 04:36.029
Now, do we?

04:36.063 --> 04:37.163
No, we do not!

04:37.197 --> 04:40.300
Well, thank you very much,
Brother Darren.

04:40.334 --> 04:43.770
But let's be honest--
Black ice is the real menace.

04:43.804 --> 04:47.006
Last night I was in
a perfectly safe neighborhood,

04:47.041 --> 04:49.842
walking away
from an A.T.M. machine,

04:49.876 --> 04:51.944
when black ice
just snuck up on me

04:51.979 --> 04:54.680
and practically robbed me
of my balance.

04:54.715 --> 04:57.883
Ouch. That sounds exactly like
something black ice would do.

04:57.918 --> 05:02.421
Well, I just hope that folks
watch out so the white snow

05:02.456 --> 05:04.690
doesn't blind them
and keep them from seeing

05:04.724 --> 05:06.392
what's really going on.

05:06.426 --> 05:07.760
All I'm saying
is I can't think

05:07.794 --> 05:10.162
of a single Christmas song
about black ice.

05:10.196 --> 05:13.365
Lots of cheerful, uplifting
songs about snow, so...

05:13.399 --> 05:15.367
(laughs)
Well...

05:15.402 --> 05:19.338
For the record, black ice
never asked to be out here.

05:19.372 --> 05:20.939
No, it did not!

05:20.973 --> 05:24.142
It's a product
of the environment.

05:24.176 --> 05:26.344
Ooh, Hallelujah!

05:26.378 --> 05:29.414
In fact, black ice
didn't land on the road.

05:29.448 --> 05:31.649
The road
landed on black ice!

05:31.684 --> 05:34.685
Whoo! Amen!

05:34.719 --> 05:37.288
Okay.

05:37.322 --> 05:40.767
Next up, why is America
being ruined by black people?

06:08.887 --> 06:10.821
I never met him,
but I hear he left

06:10.856 --> 06:12.256
some pretty big shoes
to fill.

06:12.290 --> 06:14.658
Let's get one thing
straight.

06:14.693 --> 06:19.097
You're never gonna
fill Jimenez's shoes, ever.

06:19.131 --> 06:23.736
Jimenez was a good man,
better cop.

06:23.770 --> 06:25.471
Fill Jimenez's shoes?

06:25.505 --> 06:28.374

06:31.812 --> 06:33.345

was a great cop.

06:33.380 --> 06:35.114
The best!

06:35.148 --> 06:37.083
Okay.

06:37.117 --> 06:39.051
Uh...

06:39.086 --> 06:40.953
(exhales deeply)

06:40.987 --> 06:42.855
So these prostitute murders--

06:42.889 --> 06:46.225
Um...
Seems like a serial killer.

06:46.260 --> 06:47.226
Could be.

06:47.261 --> 06:48.962
I actually
worked out a theory.

06:48.996 --> 06:53.033
I don't give a hobo's hat
about your theory.

06:53.068 --> 06:55.235
You think Jimenez
worked off of theories,

06:55.269 --> 06:58.504
like some kind
of a needle-dick Charles Darwin?

06:58.539 --> 07:01.340
Not on your ass.

07:01.374 --> 07:06.145
Jimenez always shot
straight from the dick.

07:06.179 --> 07:07.880
You think you're Jimenez?

07:07.914 --> 07:09.181
Absolutely not.

You're goddamn right
you're not!

07:10.584 --> 07:11.584
I just said I'm--

07:11.618 --> 07:13.052
Jimenez
would've busted 20 perps

07:13.086 --> 07:15.220
in the time it'd take you
to pull up your pants

07:15.254 --> 07:19.158
over your itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny
yellow polka-dot ba-pee-pee.

07:19.192 --> 07:21.527

raising 'em on his own.

Huh, Mr. Babydick?

07:25.633 --> 07:26.800
What is going on?

07:26.835 --> 07:28.869
- You want to be their daddy?
- No!

07:28.903 --> 07:30.070
You know what?
I think--

07:30.105 --> 07:31.705
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

07:31.740 --> 07:33.540
- Not Jimenez.
- Oh...

07:33.575 --> 07:35.175
Jimenez got off
on the right foot

07:35.210 --> 07:37.210

of his goddamn life...

07:37.245 --> 07:38.211
Uh-huh.

than I can say

07:39.413 --> 07:41.548
for your
pebble-penis-havin' ass.

07:41.582 --> 07:43.482
- What?
- Jimenez wannabe!

07:43.517 --> 07:45.851
I can assure you
I don't want to be Jimenez!

07:45.886 --> 07:47.486
Why not?
What's wrong with Jimenez?

07:47.521 --> 07:48.688
There's nothing wrong
with Jimenez.

07:48.722 --> 07:49.755
Then why wouldn't you
want to be like him?

07:49.790 --> 07:51.090
I don't know.
You said--

07:51.125 --> 07:52.192
Smurf pecker!

07:52.226 --> 07:54.427
Okay, I'm out.
I can't--

07:54.462 --> 07:56.663
I can't make this work.

08:02.570 --> 08:04.908
Jimenez
would've made it work.

08:09.410 --> 08:11.511
Come back from Florida soon,
Jimenez.

08:13.752 --> 08:14.986
Jordan, would you say that

08:15.020 --> 08:17.288
there's a distinct possibility
that, perhaps,

08:17.323 --> 08:18.823
<i>Star Wars</i> might be
a little bit racist?

08:18.858 --> 08:20.525
- Oh, yes.
- Just a little bit.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.694
There's, like, two black guys
in the whole universe.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.496
Not only is it far, far away,

08:26.531 --> 08:29.164
it's clearly
a long, long time ago.

08:29.199 --> 08:30.732
Right.

08:30.767 --> 08:32.534
So last year we had--

08:32.568 --> 08:35.470
we had the incomparable
Billy Dee Williams on our show.

08:35.504 --> 08:36.571
Mm-hmm.

08:36.606 --> 08:38.173
And he's
in <i>Empire Strikes Back</i>.

08:38.207 --> 08:40.342
And his coolness makes it look
like he's in a different movie,

08:40.376 --> 08:41.809
'cause my man just
walks up talking about,

08:41.844 --> 08:45.148
"Hey, Han.
Chewbacca."

08:47.151 --> 08:49.453
And they had
Samuel L. Jackson.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.422
My man had the first
purple lightsaber.

08:51.456 --> 08:53.490
Yeah.
(laughter)

08:53.525 --> 08:56.794
How you gonna
give Mace Windu

08:56.828 --> 09:00.530
a grape-flavored
lightsaber?

09:00.565 --> 09:02.299
What?

09:08.239 --> 09:11.642
Lando! What?
Oh, snap!

09:11.676 --> 09:13.377
Yo, Lando!

09:13.412 --> 09:14.645
Yo, Lando Calrissian!

09:14.680 --> 09:16.147
Oh, hi.
Yeah, that's me.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.583
Oh... dude!
Lando!

09:19.618 --> 09:23.754
Yo! Yo, you straight up running
Cloud City right now, dog!

09:23.788 --> 09:24.889
- (chuckles)
- That's you, man!

09:24.923 --> 09:26.056
You out there just--

09:26.091 --> 09:27.625
(imitates ship engine whirring,
laser blasts)

09:27.659 --> 09:28.625
Swoosh!

09:28.660 --> 09:30.761
Well, you know,
I-I do my best.

09:30.795 --> 09:33.496
Zeef, man. Zeef Howdo.
Big fan, big fan.

09:33.531 --> 09:36.499
Well, Zeef, it's real nice
to make your acquaintance.

09:36.534 --> 09:37.767
Straight up, though--
Straight up, man.

09:37.802 --> 09:40.104
You an inspiration
to all of us, man.

09:40.138 --> 09:43.040
You insp-- you're the reason
I'm out here in Cloud City, dog.

09:43.074 --> 09:44.374
- Man, I ain't even joking, man.
- That's nice.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.943
- But, yo, ideally, though?
- Yeah?

09:45.977 --> 09:48.678
Ideally--
On an ideal situation,

09:48.712 --> 09:50.079
I would be doing
like what you're doing.

09:50.114 --> 09:51.914
I'd be up there, like,
in the high chambers

09:51.949 --> 09:53.316
of Cloud City, dog.

09:53.350 --> 09:54.683
Well, Zeef,
it's nice to meet you.

09:54.718 --> 09:56.151
Yo, right on, man,

09:56.186 --> 09:57.619
'cause they got me
in the carbonite room

09:57.653 --> 09:58.687
right now, son.

09:58.721 --> 09:59.955
That's bull[bleep], right?

09:59.989 --> 10:02.291
They got me working
with some pig dudes and whatnot.

10:02.325 --> 10:04.093
Yo, I ain't no pig,
you know?

10:04.127 --> 10:05.461
And you ever notice, man,

10:05.495 --> 10:08.297
there ain't a lot of brothers
out here, man, in space.

10:08.331 --> 10:10.299
Right? It's like they're
trying to keep us down, man.

10:10.333 --> 10:13.235
You know, I-I don't think
that it's the policy.

10:13.270 --> 10:15.771
I just think it's
really, really difficult

10:15.806 --> 10:17.406
to get to this level.

10:17.440 --> 10:21.210
You've got to understand
the politics of the Empire

10:21.244 --> 10:22.378
and, at the same time,

10:22.412 --> 10:23.812
all the motivations
of the Rebel Alliance.

10:23.847 --> 10:25.147
- All that, man, all that.
- You've got--

10:25.181 --> 10:26.849
All that, all that,
all that, all that, all that.

10:26.883 --> 10:28.584
But ideally, though, man?

10:28.619 --> 10:31.153
Ideally, what I'm talking
about is, like, me and you--

10:31.188 --> 10:33.689
we should, like, do something
together, though, man,

10:33.724 --> 10:36.091
'cause if you think about it,
yo, when I was younger, man,

10:36.126 --> 10:38.160
I used to fly those landspeeders
all the time.

10:38.195 --> 10:40.162
My friends was like,
"Man, you should be piloting

10:40.197 --> 10:41.931
one of the X-Wings,"
right?

10:41.966 --> 10:43.366
And so that's,
like, disappointing, man,

10:43.400 --> 10:44.934
'cause I got here,
and they just had me, like,

10:44.968 --> 10:47.369
cleaning up the R2 units
after the X-Wings come in.

10:47.404 --> 10:49.337
Zeef, I got to go.

10:49.372 --> 10:50.939
You should prob--
Oh, no.

10:50.973 --> 10:53.441
Man, I'm saying, man,
how do we contact one another?

10:53.476 --> 10:54.476
'cause that's
the most important thing--

10:54.510 --> 10:55.810
that we contact one another,

10:55.845 --> 10:57.613
'cause, yo, look, man,
ideally, though?

10:57.647 --> 10:59.081
Ideally though?

10:59.115 --> 11:01.683
I would get to fly, somehow,
like, the Millennium Falcon.

11:01.718 --> 11:02.818
Like, that would be cool.
(device beeps)

11:02.852 --> 11:04.719
And, yo, let me get you my--
like, my cont--

11:04.754 --> 11:06.421
I got my card
in here somewhere.

11:06.455 --> 11:07.522
(beeping)
Man, I'm just trying

11:07.556 --> 11:09.357
to find this, like,
pocket right here,

11:09.391 --> 11:11.526
'cause these--
sometimes, these suits,

11:11.560 --> 11:13.695
- they don't got no pockets.
- You know what, Zeef?

11:13.729 --> 11:16.131
Just give your information
to Lobot here,

11:16.165 --> 11:18.366
and we'll be in touch.

11:18.401 --> 11:19.534

and bottle caps.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.312

19:14.903 --> 19:17.037

for real medical problems?

19:17.072 --> 19:18.405
And even then,
we have a deductible.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.541
I'm going to deduct
the fat from my ass

19:20.576 --> 19:21.642

I'm telling you right now.

19:26.347 --> 19:27.948

- Insurance is not for you

19:27.982 --> 19:29.883

of your body cut off

19:29.917 --> 19:32.152

you'd die almost immediately.

to do that, but you can't do it.

19:57.545 --> 19:58.979
I'm gonna
have two stomachs!

19:59.013 --> 20:00.247
I'm gonna get another stomach.

20:00.281 --> 20:02.516
One for cherries
and one for corn.

20:02.550 --> 20:03.951
- Oh, my God.
- That's right, Sammy.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.152
I'm gonna go
to couples therapy alone

20:05.187 --> 20:06.521
- and just play both parts.
- Yeah.

20:06.555 --> 20:07.689
I'm gonna
go to the gynecologist

20:07.723 --> 20:09.290
and just ask questions
till I get it.

20:09.325 --> 20:10.992
Oh, and I got
another question--

20:11.026 --> 20:12.693
a few questions
about how many different parts

20:12.728 --> 20:13.928
of your body
you can make blink.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.862
'cause I want to get
my "earlids" done

20:15.897 --> 20:17.230
and then my foot pockets.

20:17.265 --> 20:19.866
Foot pockets are this invention
I've been thinking of...

20:19.900 --> 20:21.201
(hardcore metal music playing)
where you can just put...

20:21.235 --> 20:22.836
your keys
up by your ankles.

20:22.870 --> 20:24.404
Then I'm gonna have a coaster
put in my shoulder,

20:24.438 --> 20:25.738
so when I go to a bar,
I can say,

20:25.773 --> 20:26.940
"You want a drink on me?"

20:26.974 --> 20:28.708
And then I'm just gonna
be, like, a monster,

20:28.742 --> 20:30.143
and then for Halloween,
I'm gonna dress up

20:30.177 --> 20:31.611
like a normal human being.

20:31.645 --> 20:33.579
(cheers and applause)
Thank you, everybody.

20:33.613 --> 20:35.114
You guys have--
You guys have been--

20:35.148 --> 20:37.048
Uh, you guys
have been great tonight.

20:37.083 --> 20:39.450
And we just wanted
to say thank you

20:39.484 --> 20:41.952
and say good-bye
as well, and--

20:41.987 --> 20:44.922
Jimenez would never
have said good-bye.

20:44.956 --> 20:46.323
(laughter)

20:46.358 --> 20:47.759
Good night, everybody.

20:47.793 --> 20:52.164
(cheers and applause)

20:52.198 --> 20:55.166
<i>♪ I'm gonna do
my one line here ♪</i>

20:55.201 --> 20:57.335
Oh, yeah.
