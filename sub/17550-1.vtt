00:39.160 --> 00:41.116
Hey, hey, hey!

00:41.400 --> 00:42.760
What the fuck?

00:44.200 --> 00:46.031
Wait! I gotta call it in!

00:49.000 --> 00:50.035
Move it!

00:59.040 --> 01:00.075
Hey!

01:01.680 --> 01:03.079
Bobby, you hear me?

01:09.840 --> 01:11.319
Right there, motherfucker!

01:28.520 --> 01:29.839
Please.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.831
Just fucking stop, man!

01:32.000 --> 01:33.513
Just put the gun down!

01:36.680 --> 01:38.796
Come on.

01:38.960 --> 01:39.995
Please.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.598
I'm fucking begging you.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.354
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

01:45.520 --> 01:47.000
I wasn't even...

02:12.040 --> 02:14.759
Worse on Friday
Died on Saturday

02:14.920 --> 02:16.035
Buried on Sunday

02:16.240 --> 02:18.959
That was the end
Of Solomon Grundy

02:19.120 --> 02:21.759
Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

02:21.920 --> 02:23.478
Christened on Tuesday

02:25.880 --> 02:27.950
Justine, please.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.233
It's called "stimming,"
self-stimulation.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.912
Whereas you and I might tap our fingers,

02:38.080 --> 02:40.548
grind our teeth, bite our nails,

02:40.760 --> 02:42.478
your son rocks back and forth.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.433
It's more obvious, but perfectly natural.

02:45.640 --> 02:49.076
We came here because
we heard you specialized in...

02:49.240 --> 02:51.117
What is it? What does he have?

02:51.280 --> 02:53.919
I'm not a fan of labels, ma'am.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.273
Your son is a remarkable young man.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.193
Who goes crazy
when you turn the vacuum on.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.432
He wears one T-shirt,
won't let you hug him.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.431
Loud noises, bright lights

03:05.600 --> 03:08.910
can be especially difficult
for someone like your son.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.317
The shirt, most likely fabric sensitivity.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.597
Hugging,
closeness, touching...

03:15.880 --> 03:16.880
Justine, no shoes today.

03:17.040 --> 03:18.656
That can be a challenge, yes.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.520
When it's somebody else's child,

03:20.640 --> 03:22.198
it's a challenge.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.358
When it's yours,

03:24.520 --> 03:25.794
it's a problem.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.678
My practice focuses on education.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.308
I'd like to work with your son,
at his speed.

03:32.840 --> 03:36.196
Help him develop the skills
he'll need to lead a full life.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.118
Communicating, eye contact,

03:38.320 --> 03:40.231
understanding non-verbal cues,

03:40.400 --> 03:41.833
making friends.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.798
The only friend
he has is his little brother.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.313
I'm sure moving from base to base
hasn 't helped.

03:49.080 --> 03:52.993
My husband's in the Army,
which means we all are.

03:54.160 --> 03:57.152
Would you be willing to let your son
stay with us for the summer

03:57.320 --> 04:00.915
free of charge, working with me
in a sensory-friendly environment?

04:01.080 --> 04:02.718
That's not gonna happen.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.988
If loud noises and bright lights
bother him,

04:06.160 --> 04:08.549
he needs more of it, not less.

04:09.320 --> 04:12.357
The world is not
a sensory-friendly place,

04:12.560 --> 04:14.676
and that's where
he needs to learn to live.

04:16.519 --> 04:17.748
Not in here.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.033
Doctor, in your opinion,

04:20.560 --> 04:23.393
can our son lead a normal life?

04:24.200 --> 04:26.236
Define normal.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.511
I need to finish! I need to finish!

05:07.160 --> 05:09.720
Hmm. Mmm.

05:26.840 --> 05:31.072
I, uh... I never thought of myself
as a quitter... Fourth-generation farmer.

05:33.080 --> 05:36.629
But between the property taxes

05:37.320 --> 05:39.754
and the fertilizer costs, and insurance...

05:44.960 --> 05:46.075
Oh, to hell with it.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.635
What if, just temporarily, mind you,

05:48.800 --> 05:51.633
we put this year's taxes
on our credit card?

05:58.040 --> 05:59.359
Do you like it?

05:59.520 --> 06:00.873
I made it myself.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.598
No, not particularly.

06:03.480 --> 06:04.959
But do you ever sell them?

06:05.120 --> 06:06.599
At church fairs now and again.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.712
Mrs. Rice, you may have what the IRS
calls a "home-based business."

06:09.880 --> 06:12.040
What room do you use in your house
when you make those?

06:12.160 --> 06:13.195
I don't, really.

06:13.360 --> 06:14.998
Just wherever I happen to be, I guess.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.628
In front of the TV,
at the kitchen table.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.176
I like to spread my beads out
in the dining room, but Frank gets...

06:20.200 --> 06:22.475
Yes, it would be better
if you could try to remember

06:22.640 --> 06:24.949
the one specific space that you use.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.316
Your home is 2,913 square feet.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.478
IRS code allows us to deduct
from your taxable income

06:30.640 --> 06:33.313
a percentage of your workspace
relative to your overall home.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.640
- What...
- Mr. Rice...

06:34.960 --> 06:36.518
How big is your dining room?

06:37.160 --> 06:38.388
Mrs. Rice's office.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.880
I wouldn't
so much as call it an office...

06:40.960 --> 06:42.440
Oh.

06:42.800 --> 06:46.395
It's, uh, approximately 200, uh...

06:51.880 --> 06:53.996
Well, make it 300 square feet.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.673
Excellent. Mrs. Rice...

06:55.840 --> 06:56.909
Dolores.

06:57.080 --> 07:00.436
Dolores, when you order supplies,
do you order online?

07:00.600 --> 07:02.989
I don't. I just zip on over
to the bead store.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.388
Zip?

07:04.680 --> 07:07.148
I drive the truck.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.558
The company truck.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.349
Come in.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.656
Mr. King, you have wandered

07:33.680 --> 07:35.272
so far outside your legal purview.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.998
As president of Southern Gulf Bank,

07:37.160 --> 07:39.720
I intend to protect
my customers' privacy...

07:39.880 --> 07:40.915
Stop talking.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.520
You have a very cavalier attitude
for the president of a bank,

07:43.560 --> 07:45.080
with such a piss-poor capital cushion.

07:45.280 --> 07:48.716
Now, I want a record of every transaction
Abayed has had for the past two years.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.553
Deposits, withdrawals,
cashier's checks, credit cards.

07:51.720 --> 07:54.871
Birmingham or Bahrain,
it is now Treasury business.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.393
Goodbye.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.073
Medina.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.593
Am I saying that correctly?

07:59.760 --> 08:00.875
Medina, yes, sir.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.238
I've read all your case files,
Director King.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.073
It's impressive work. Very.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.391
Marybeth Ascension Medina.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.915
Graduated University of Baltimore
cum laude

08:13.080 --> 08:15.116
with a degree in criminal justice.

08:15.280 --> 08:19.831
Two years Baltimore PD as an analyst,
two more at Homeland, analyst again,

08:20.240 --> 08:23.789
and the last five years here at Treasury.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.154
Analyst.

08:26.240 --> 08:29.676
You did the heavy lifting
on Agent Lorenz's case last month.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.431
I worked on it, yeah, but Agent Lorenz...

08:32.600 --> 08:35.273
Why haven't you applied
for promotion to agent?

08:35.760 --> 08:37.273
You're already doing the work.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.918
Analyst is a good fit.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.111
And I enjoy the work, so...

08:44.680 --> 08:47.672
Well, you're a liar, Medina.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.393
Ward of the state of Maryland's

08:52.560 --> 08:54.835
foster care
and juvenile detention systems

08:55.000 --> 08:57.116
from age 11 to 18.

08:57.280 --> 09:00.272
Weapons charges, assault and battery.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.189
Ouch.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.191
Attempted murder.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.558
Those records were sealed.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.552
Is that a nine millimeter?

09:15.560 --> 09:16.629
.45.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.156
You better sit your ass
back down in that chair, young lady.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.150
This is a big moment for you.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.237
Make a good choice.

09:36.320 --> 09:41.314
Lying on a federal employment application
is a felony.

09:43.240 --> 09:48.997
So right now, I'm the only thing standing
between you and significant prison time.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.157
What do you want?

09:54.920 --> 09:57.992
Do you like puzzles, Marybeth Medina?

10:01.280 --> 10:04.511
I meant what I said, son.
You're welcome out to the place anytime.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.318
Do you fish? I got a two-acre pond

10:06.480 --> 10:08.016
that is just thick with catfish and bass...

10:08.040 --> 10:10.349
I don't fish. I shoot.

10:10.520 --> 10:14.195
Well, the farm's a perfect place
to do a little plinkin', so...

10:15.040 --> 10:16.040
Well...

10:16.920 --> 10:18.069
Thank you.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.712
You take care, son.

10:20.880 --> 10:21.949
Thank you.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.472
My daughter's meeting me for lunch.
I think you two just might hit it off.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.039
Nice to see you.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.789
Already enhanced.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.236
Was taken three years ago in Antwerp
by an undercover Interpol agent.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.277
Their target's on the far right.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.874
Yeah, Zalmay Atta.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.635
Go on.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.714
Ran the world's largest opium pipeline.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.394
Ties to Karzai and Ghani, Taliban.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.994
I mean, he was considered untouchable.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.390
Look at the rest. Tell me what you see.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.912
Yeah, I remember most of these arrests.
They were huge.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.230
Focus. They're not all arrests.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.759
It's the same man.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.353
"Lou Carroll."

11:27.080 --> 11:28.911
For what it's worth, it's an alias.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.190
The Hong Kong photo
goes back about five years.

11:31.360 --> 11:33.954
In that one, he's "Carl Gauss."

11:35.080 --> 11:39.437
Tokyo, Tel Aviv, Naples.
There was a sighting in Tehran.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.511
All describing the same man.
"An accountant."

11:41.720 --> 11:44.109
"Our accountant." "The accountant."

11:44.280 --> 11:47.397
The accountant, like CPA accountant?

11:49.360 --> 11:50.475
Okay.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.634
Say you're the head of the Sinaloa Cartel.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.355
Now, the cartels count their money

11:56.520 --> 11:58.670
by weighing it in 18-wheelers.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.117
But one sunny Mexican day,

12:01.320 --> 12:04.949
your in-house money scrubber comes to you
and says you're 30 million light.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.390
Who can you trust to do
the forensic accounting,

12:07.560 --> 12:09.312
track your stolen cash?

12:09.480 --> 12:11.675
Deloitte and Touche? H&R Block?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.631
You somehow

12:14.800 --> 12:17.678
contact an individual
capable of coming in cold,

12:17.880 --> 12:20.155
un-cooking years of books,

12:20.840 --> 12:22.831
and getting out alive.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.798
I retire in seven months.

12:24.960 --> 12:29.670
Before I do, I need to know
who he is, how he does it.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.400
I mean, who survives
this kind of clientele?

12:32.600 --> 12:34.591
The secrets this guy has.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.400
What exactly do you want me to do?

12:40.280 --> 12:42.157
Report directly to me.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.839
No other case work.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.355
No other Treasury personnel involved.

12:46.920 --> 12:50.117
At the end of the month,
one of two things will have occurred.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.031
Resolution of this case,

12:56.120 --> 12:58.395
or we update your photo.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.790
You want it your way?
You got it!

14:46.320 --> 14:47.958
Mom! Mom! Mom!

14:48.120 --> 14:50.315
Mom! Why is Mom leaving? Mom!

14:50.560 --> 14:52.278
Mom! Mom!

14:53.720 --> 14:55.631
- I just got home.
- You're always...

15:05.720 --> 15:06.720
Mom! Why are you leaving?

15:06.960 --> 15:08.136
I'm just asking you to stay.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.456
- Just, please stay.
- We had help!

15:09.480 --> 15:11.520
- Stay here! Don't go anywhere!
- You threw it away!

15:16.440 --> 15:17.555
No. Hey.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.349
That's it.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.880
Please don't leave...

15:26.080 --> 15:27.736
Mom!

15:27.760 --> 15:29.280
Here we go, here we go.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.680
Here we go.

- That was the end of Solomon Grundy

15:53.120 --> 15:54.792
Do it again.

Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

16:37.600 --> 16:40.239
Looks like somebody's seen
too many westerns.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.953
Yeah, must be what...

16:44.760 --> 16:46.113
A mile out?

16:48.440 --> 16:50.351
Not on my best day...

17:04.400 --> 17:05.752
Holy shit.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.756
Okay, listen to me.

18:40.920 --> 18:44.799
In-flec-tion. Right?
Listen, just listen to my tone.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.793
I say, "Oh, I'm another year older,

18:47.960 --> 18:51.555
"and I don't know if I'm ever gonna
get out of this fucking place."

18:51.720 --> 18:53.199
And you say...

18:53.400 --> 18:55.176
You're probably right, Francis.
You're extremely old.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.696
- It's unlikely you'll survive to...
- No. No...

18:56.720 --> 18:58.870
No. Hold on. That's not what you say.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.034
Two years together
every night, you know.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.277
I gave you a PhD in black money,
but you gotta learn this.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.158
- This is crucial.
- You're frustrated.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.600
- What am I?
- You're frustrated.

19:09.560 --> 19:10.709
That's what I am.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.478
I'm frustrated. Good, good. Excellent.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.956
Finally. All right. Let's do another one.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.757
Lights out, ladies.
Lights out.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.720
Names and addresses. Go.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.996
Semion Ivankov.
79 Primorsky Boulevard, Odessa.

19:27.160 --> 19:31.756
The Meier brothers, Moshe and Itzhak.
221 She'arim Boulevard in Jerusalem.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.673
Dominic Rabito of
960 Court Street, Brooklyn.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.068
Ask for Bobby.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.469
Ask for Bobby.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.880
You know, I'm old.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.276
I may be remembering things
a little rosier than they were.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.519
I mean, you want to fill out 1040s
and itemize deductions,

19:46.680 --> 19:48.760
and pull in 50 grand a year?
I mean, that's a living.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.673
Because if you go down
this road, this road...

19:51.840 --> 19:55.355
You can't go back, you understand?
It's dangerous. Do you understand?

19:55.520 --> 19:56.589
I understand.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.433
You find one person
you can trust, just one.

19:59.600 --> 20:03.479
And do not make my mistake.
You keep moving your ass around.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.191
They gave me a new handler today.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.789
I don't like this guy. He's dull.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.788
Worried.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.313
Ah, fuck it.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.352
Good night, son.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.392
Good night, Francis.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.550
What about Zurich? Saudi Arabia?

20:43.760 --> 20:45.096
The Swiss are cheap.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.520
Dubai is one thing, but we're
too conspicuous in the Kingdom.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.715
I vote Chicago.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.872
- Why?
- There's an uptick in online chatter.

20:52.040 --> 20:53.189
People looking for you.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.510
- What people?
- The unfriendly kind.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.996
Let's try a legitimate client for once.

20:58.160 --> 21:01.914
No cartels, arms brokers,
money launderers, assassins.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.920
I like safe. I like you safe.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.600
Everyone's hiding something.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.432
At least there's honor among thieves.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.751
There's honor among Illinois
electronics manufacturers.

21:12.560 --> 21:16.678
They're in your current backyard.
No risk of movement. You'll meet?

21:17.640 --> 21:18.709
Yeah, I'll meet.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.918
One last piece of business.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.229
Just the Renoir.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.120
I don't have
a buyer for the Renoir.

21:24.280 --> 21:27.352
The Pollock can move.
Will you ever let it go?

21:29.760 --> 21:30.760
Hello?

21:30.920 --> 21:33.354
Just the Renoir. Drop the price.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.233
Heavy sigh.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.270
Go to work, dreamboat.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.753
Now, Mr. Wolff, I half-suspect
we're wasting your time.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.433
I'm quite sure you're not.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.113
And you know this how?

21:54.280 --> 21:55.872
I'm on the clock.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.068
Shit.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.071
I hope we're not wasting ours then.

22:01.400 --> 22:05.393
Look, kidding aside, I think if you
saw our books, you'd run for the hills.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.274
We have an incredibly complicated
accounting system.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.908
Depreciation schedules
on hundreds of different items.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.957
Full-time and contract employees.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.111
Department of Defense classified accounts.

22:16.280 --> 22:17.429
It's a numerical shitstorm.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.433
I'll need to see all those books
for the past 10 years.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.239
Bank statements, complete list
of clients and vendors.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.352
Hard copies printed out, my eyes only.
All the information's right here.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.828
Okay, well, well, look.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.833
This all came to my attention
only last week.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.958
Now, a junior cost accountant
stuck her nose where it didn't belong,

22:34.160 --> 22:36.151
and obviously had no idea
what she was looking at.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.590
Lamar's overreacting.
There's no missing money.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.115
How long have you been CFO
of this company, sir?

22:41.280 --> 22:42.349
15 years.

22:42.520 --> 22:44.556
I need the books for the past 15, please.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.111
Well, you're awful goddamn blunt!

22:47.280 --> 22:49.794
I'm Lamar Blackburn's oldest friend.

22:49.960 --> 22:50.960
I've been by his side

22:51.120 --> 22:54.430
since he was turning out RC robots
that RadioShack called crap.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.109
I wouldn't take a dime without his say-so.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.029
You're angry.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.519
Oh, this is bullshit.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.312
Unusual way of making contact with you,
Mr. Wolff.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.951
You were recommended by Mansoor Haqqani.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.509
We custom-made prosthetics
for his youngest daughter.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.912
You may know that she lost both legs

23:13.120 --> 23:15.634
to a car bomb
outside his investment firm in Lahore.

23:16.560 --> 23:20.473
He told my brother, Lamar, that you were
nothing short of supernatural.

23:22.080 --> 23:26.039
Mr. Haqqani holds advanced degrees
in mathematics from Cambridge

23:26.200 --> 23:28.031
and Caltech.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.990
Why does a man like that need you?

23:32.080 --> 23:34.355
I don't discuss client business.

25:05.520 --> 25:08.512
What do you suppose that young man
is thinking right now?

25:09.760 --> 25:11.751
"Why do I still feel my arm?"

25:11.920 --> 25:13.148
I don't know.

25:13.360 --> 25:16.670
"How did everything go so wrong,
so fast?"

25:17.520 --> 25:20.193
"It's cold. Turn up the heat."

25:22.320 --> 25:23.594
Christian Wolff, I presume.

25:23.760 --> 25:24.760
Mr. Blackburn.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.188
Lamar.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.789
Lamar.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.269
Come with me.

25:33.440 --> 25:37.115
Are you aware of Living Robotics'
three income streams?

25:37.280 --> 25:39.589
Consumer electronics,
next generation prosthetics,

25:39.760 --> 25:41.273
unmanned military applications.

25:41.480 --> 25:44.358
Prosthetics division showed tremendous
growth over the last 10 years.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.879
It seems to have matured.

25:46.040 --> 25:49.669
Consumer products is your highest source
of revenue, followed closely

25:49.840 --> 25:52.718
by Defense Department contracts
and prosthetics at two and three.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.792
Yeah. You are well-informed.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.389
I never married.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.039
Never had kids.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.316
This company is my child.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.154
That said,
money has never been a motivation.

26:08.320 --> 26:11.995
Balance sheets,
profit and loss statements...

26:12.840 --> 26:15.308
My mind doesn't function
the way yours must.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.033
I need you to be my eyes and ears, Chris.

26:19.200 --> 26:22.954
Whatever you need to do your job,
you let me know.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.832
I'll start in the morning.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.191
Son of a bitch.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.274
Bloody hell.

27:01.760 --> 27:02.909
Excuse me...

27:03.280 --> 27:05.555
Who the fuck do you think you are?

27:05.720 --> 27:07.551
Do you know who the fuck I am?

27:08.200 --> 27:09.713
Simon Dewey.

27:10.560 --> 27:13.552
Founder, CEO, Dewey Capital.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.953
American. Shocking.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.034
I have kidnap insurance.
You obviously know that.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.016
Sorry, but how in the world
would I know that you have...

27:22.040 --> 27:23.553
You people fucking amaze me...

27:25.240 --> 27:28.152
When you interrupt somebody like that,
it makes them feel

27:28.320 --> 27:31.073
that you're just not interested
in what they have to say.

27:31.240 --> 27:32.960
Or maybe you just think
what you have to say

27:33.080 --> 27:35.071
is more important than what I have to say.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.958
Is that what you think?

27:39.400 --> 27:42.870
That gun makes you a big man, does it?

27:44.240 --> 27:46.800
This gun? Simon, come on.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.118
I'm part of a small but potent department
of a private security force.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.636
We have a client, let's call it
a European manufacturing concern.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.268
You're shorting their stock,
but simultaneously,

27:59.440 --> 28:02.113
you're spreading false rumors
regarding the health of the company.

28:02.320 --> 28:05.949
The resulting decline in the stock price,
it's made you your millions,

28:06.160 --> 28:07.912
but it's been at my client's expense.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.475
They have been forced
to cut hundreds of jobs, Simon.

28:10.640 --> 28:14.110
These are third-generation metal workers,
people with families.

28:14.280 --> 28:16.840
Pensions are being rendered worthless
because of you.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.958
But you'll stop now. Correct?

28:20.960 --> 28:21.960
Which company?

28:22.320 --> 28:23.469
Wrong answer, Simon.

28:23.680 --> 28:24.795
Look, genius...

28:26.520 --> 28:27.640
That's the same spot, Simon.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.115
Why you gonna let me hit you
in the same exact spot?

28:30.280 --> 28:31.395
I only meant

28:31.800 --> 28:33.791
we hold short positions
on dozens of companies.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.109
Shit, son.

28:35.640 --> 28:36.868
I suppose

28:37.040 --> 28:39.713
you're spreading false information
about more than one company.

28:39.880 --> 28:43.759
If that's what you're doing, you're just
gonna have to stop shorting them all.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.840
That's ridiculous.
I can't be expected to...

28:48.680 --> 28:50.398
Ooh, I know.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.037
All right, get your chin up, Simon.
No pouting on my watch.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.153
Yeah, you're a man. You just...

28:57.320 --> 28:58.753
You're a man in your own way.

29:02.640 --> 29:03.640
All right.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.639
I'm an avid reader of the Journal.

29:09.800 --> 29:13.156
So, I expect the cooperation
to be reflected there.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.148
Simon?

29:16.520 --> 29:17.748
Are we good?

29:18.240 --> 29:19.240
Yeah?

29:22.080 --> 29:24.230
Attaboy, Simon. Proud of you.

30:12.960 --> 30:13.960
Oh, hello.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.436
Good morning. Oh, shit... Hi.

30:18.080 --> 30:19.115
- Hi.
- Um, um...

30:19.920 --> 30:22.639
I'm Dana Cummings.
You're the consultant? Mr. Wolff?

30:22.840 --> 30:25.638
- Chris.
- Hi, Chris, then.

30:25.840 --> 30:26.955
I'm Dana.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.394
Cummings.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.799
Yes. Um...

30:31.400 --> 30:33.470
These are all the files you wanted.

30:33.680 --> 30:37.514
I cross-referenced them
by year, and alphabetically, so...

30:38.160 --> 30:39.593
It must have taken you all night.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.239
It sure did.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.480
Hmm.

30:43.760 --> 30:44.760
Right.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.509
So...

30:51.000 --> 30:52.149
So...

30:55.920 --> 30:57.831
What do you want, Dana Cummings?

30:58.720 --> 31:01.359
Oh, Mr. Blackburn, um...

31:02.360 --> 31:03.952
Sorry, he said I should...

31:04.320 --> 31:07.278
I'm the person
who first noticed the missing...

31:07.440 --> 31:10.432
- What I think was the missing money.
- Yes, I understand. I'll find it.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.955
Yeah. I thought we could... Have lunch...

31:15.280 --> 31:16.633
I brought my own lunch.

31:16.800 --> 31:17.949
No...

31:18.360 --> 31:19.634
I bring my own lunch, too.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.950
I can answer
any questions that you have...

31:22.120 --> 31:24.190
I have no questions.

31:25.120 --> 31:29.432
Yeah, okay. Yeah, you wanna
make your own assessment.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.794
Yes, thank you.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.111
Okay. Um...

31:34.960 --> 31:37.474
I'm in accounting if you need anything.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.153
There's, uh,

31:39.320 --> 31:41.151
some donuts there for you.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.151
I don't eat donuts.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Okay.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.160
Mr. Secretary!

31:53.320 --> 31:54.456
Yes, Helen.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.879
Sir, there's been speculation

31:56.040 --> 31:59.112
that your ability
to link banks in South Florida

31:59.280 --> 32:01.157
to money laundering efforts of terrorists

32:01.320 --> 32:04.392
are actually the result of
a whistleblower or the NSA.

32:04.560 --> 32:05.560
Care to comment?

32:06.000 --> 32:07.976
Let me turn this over
to the head of my task force,

32:08.000 --> 32:10.639
Financial Crimes Director, Raymond King.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.877
Folks, there's no great mystery here.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.674
Nothing fancy. Just team effort,

32:21.840 --> 32:25.879
comprised of long hours of
good old-fashioned investigative work.

32:26.520 --> 32:27.520
Questions?

32:30.000 --> 32:31.776
Could you answer
the whistleblower question?

32:31.800 --> 32:33.080
No.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.713
Hey, Sorkis, give me something.

32:36.880 --> 32:40.873
I matched the face in your Antwerp photo
to surveillance video in NYPD database.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.873
Wait, wait, wait. NYPD?
What did you find?

32:45.200 --> 32:48.476
2006. Your guy takes out two mob enforcers

32:48.640 --> 32:52.076
with a steak knife he lifted off
an Italian restaurant down the street.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.760
Then he strolls into
a den of stone-cold killers

32:54.920 --> 32:56.797
and goes on a seven-man killing spree,

32:56.960 --> 32:58.393
using their own weapons.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.798
Headshot, headshot, headshot.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.069
Sorkis, stop.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.549
A den of stone-cold killers?
Where is this?

33:06.720 --> 33:09.553
The Ravenite. Headquarters
of the Gambino crime family.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.075
He killed Anthony "Little Tony" Bazzano.

33:12.560 --> 33:15.279
Forensics lists cause of death
as blunt force trauma.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.233
Your boy kicked him in the head once.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.231
Again. Play it again.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.152
Hey, hey, hey!

33:23.400 --> 33:25.630
What the fuck?

33:26.560 --> 33:28.676
Wait! I gotta call it in!

33:30.520 --> 33:32.351
I've also got an audio file here.

33:32.520 --> 33:34.431
Inside of the Ravenite was bugged.

33:35.840 --> 33:36.840
Come on.

33:38.680 --> 33:39.680
Please.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.319
That's Little Tony.

33:41.640 --> 33:42.914
I'm fucking begging you.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.634
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

33:45.800 --> 33:47.136
Okay,
get me that recording ASAP.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.536
I wasn't even...

33:50.640 --> 33:51.640
M.B.,

33:52.120 --> 33:54.111
you're an analyst for Treasury.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.829
What the hell have you got yourself into?

34:25.159 --> 34:27.799
What do you have to hit
to dent a steel thermos?

34:30.080 --> 34:31.478
It's just old.

34:36.840 --> 34:40.071
How did you, um,
get into financial consulting?

34:40.239 --> 34:43.118
Department of Labor
statistics indicate

34:43.280 --> 34:45.396
it's one of
the fastest-growing professions.

34:45.920 --> 34:48.911
Actuarial sciences are experiencing
tremendous growth as well.

34:51.400 --> 34:52.514
Okay.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.759
I like the balance of it.

34:58.920 --> 35:02.674
You know, I like finding things
that aren't obvious.

35:04.440 --> 35:06.510
Plus, my dad was an accountant.

35:07.520 --> 35:08.520
He actually...

35:10.680 --> 35:13.717
You know, he had the whole shtick.
The, uh...

35:15.120 --> 35:18.510
You know, the little amortization book,
and the green eyeshade,

35:18.720 --> 35:20.756
and the, like,
dorky pocket protector and...

35:20.920 --> 35:22.558
I have a pocket protector.

35:25.440 --> 35:28.637
That's a nice one.
I mean, his was dorky, that's...

35:28.800 --> 35:30.233
Yours is nice.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.431
Um, but he convinced me
to go into the field.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.040
Because I wanted to study art
at the Art Institute of Chicago,

35:37.760 --> 35:39.751
but art doesn't pay the mortgage.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.036
"Art doesn't pay the mortgage,
young lady."

35:43.880 --> 35:46.394
Dad's tastes ran more to
Dogs Playing Poker.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.039
I like Dogs Playing Poker.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.230
Because dogs would never bet on things,

35:51.400 --> 35:53.470
and so, it's incongruous.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.910
I like incongruity.

36:01.080 --> 36:04.755
Yeah, Dogs Playing Poker is nice.
It's just sort of a...

36:05.960 --> 36:07.598
Just different.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.550
So, I studied accounting
at the University of Chicago,

36:10.720 --> 36:11.755
where fun goes to die.

36:11.920 --> 36:12.920
Why?

36:14.680 --> 36:15.908
Why what?

36:16.240 --> 36:19.152
Why does fun go to die
at the University of Chicago?

36:19.920 --> 36:21.831
Oh, no, it's just an expression.

36:24.640 --> 36:25.789
I'm joking.

36:30.840 --> 36:31.840
Right.

36:41.840 --> 36:44.229
- Um, I'll leave you to it.
- Okay.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.789
Let me know if you need anything
while you're here.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.280
Have a nice day.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.919
Yes. You, too.

37:14.840 --> 37:19.960
Explain the 376,109...
6,500,000... 6, 008,000...

37:41.640 --> 37:43.376
Accounts receivable,
earnings before interest...

37:43.400 --> 37:45.197
Tax, depreciation,
administrative expenses...

37:55.120 --> 37:56.348
100,644,000...

38:01.600 --> 38:04.797
Hydraulic sync systems,
aluminum bar supplies,

38:04.960 --> 38:06.791
techmod fitting, stable joints...

38:46.040 --> 38:47.240
Please.

38:47.840 --> 38:49.239
I'm fucking begging you.

38:49.400 --> 38:52.198
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

38:52.360 --> 38:53.760
I wasn't even...

39:01.800 --> 39:03.279
Okay.

39:05.080 --> 39:06.399
Give me something.

39:11.520 --> 39:12.520
Please.

39:13.520 --> 39:14.635
...fucking begging you.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.109
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

39:17.880 --> 39:19.176
I wasn't even...

39:28.280 --> 39:30.191
Come on, come on, come on.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.240
...begging you.

39:36.480 --> 39:39.472
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

40:09.040 --> 40:10.439
Born on a Monday

40:10.800 --> 40:13.712
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

40:13.880 --> 40:14.995
Solomon Grundy

40:15.680 --> 40:17.033
Born on Monday

40:17.360 --> 40:20.352
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

40:20.560 --> 40:21.834
Solomon Grundy

40:35.320 --> 40:38.120
Come in! Come in, come in, come in.
You have to see this. Look at this.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.111
It's gonna blow you away.

40:40.280 --> 40:43.511
I mean, it'll just jump right out at you.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.635
There it is.

40:46.960 --> 40:47.960
Uh-huh.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.639
Living Robotics, 10 years ago.

40:49.840 --> 40:51.096
Earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.918
$14,495,719.

40:54.080 --> 40:55.149
Nine years ago,

40:55.720 --> 40:58.359
earnings before tax and depreciation...

40:59.080 --> 41:01.230
Revenues go up, profits go down.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.637
Down? No large capital expenditures
dragging profits down.

41:04.800 --> 41:07.109
No spike in raw materials or labor costs.

41:07.280 --> 41:09.555
Year eight,
profits and revenue both go up,

41:09.720 --> 41:11.199
but not in a commensurate fashion.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.549
X no longer equals Y.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.598
Six, five, four, three.
You're making money.

41:15.760 --> 41:16.760
But there's a leak.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.793
And the leak is...

41:19.360 --> 41:21.191
Leak, where's the leak? Here.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.880
Slewitt Manufacturing.
I've signed these checks.

41:26.960 --> 41:28.393
- Who authorized it?
- Ed.

41:28.560 --> 41:31.360
Mr. Chilton. They make electronic
assemblies for the consumer division.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.949
No, they don't. Look at this.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.712
You notice anything?

41:38.480 --> 41:40.120
- Second number in each is a three.
- Yes.

41:41.280 --> 41:43.191
Most people,
when generating random numbers

41:43.360 --> 41:44.793
tend to rely subconsciously

41:44.960 --> 41:46.216
- on certain patterns.
- Patterns, yeah.

41:46.240 --> 41:47.240
Yes.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.680
- I was right!
- You were right.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.160
Yeah.

41:52.280 --> 41:56.273
I went through these ledgers for months,
and I got through one fiscal year.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.032
You went through 15 overnight?

41:58.240 --> 41:59.680
That's not even the best part, look.

41:59.720 --> 42:03.076
The best part is, they're routing money
to a company that doesn't exist.

42:03.240 --> 42:06.232
And yet, profits go up.
And they continue going up.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.594
Absolutely makes no sense.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.796
- Where's the money coming from?
- Exactly!

42:10.320 --> 42:11.594
Um, it's not inventory?

42:11.760 --> 42:12.909
Inventory turns. No.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.230
- Chargebacks to vendors?
- No. Perfectly in order.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.755
- Internal offsets?
- No. That's a terrible idea.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.553
Um...

42:26.400 --> 42:29.233
Cummings, you're needed in

42:29.440 --> 42:31.590
whatever area I'm paying you
to be needed in.

42:31.760 --> 42:32.760
Sorry.

42:46.600 --> 42:47.635
And?

42:56.640 --> 43:00.428
$61,679,000.

43:01.320 --> 43:02.639
And some change.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.756
Who did it? Best guess.

43:05.920 --> 43:07.512
I don't guess.

43:09.360 --> 43:11.669
You'll have a report for me?

43:11.960 --> 43:13.837
When I'm finished, yes.

43:47.440 --> 43:49.317
- Hey, Ed.
- What the...

43:50.040 --> 43:51.871
We're having lemon merengue pie.

43:52.040 --> 43:54.076
Those two bottles of insulin.

43:56.680 --> 43:59.353
You know, I just thought

43:59.680 --> 44:03.036
that you would appreciate me
treating you like an adult, right?

44:03.240 --> 44:04.912
So, here's what I got.

44:10.240 --> 44:15.189
You administer your own accidental
insulin overdose, and just...

44:16.320 --> 44:17.389
Die.

44:17.560 --> 44:18.993
But do it with dignity.

44:19.240 --> 44:23.916
Your wife, who's sleeping upstairs,
she'll be the beneficiary

44:24.080 --> 44:28.039
of what's gotta be a very generous
insurance policy, am I right?

44:28.200 --> 44:30.475
But the only way she's gonna
collect on that policy, Ed,

44:30.640 --> 44:33.234
is if we have the appearance
of an accident.

44:33.440 --> 44:37.194
If we lay our hands on you,
you're gonna fight, squeal.

44:37.400 --> 44:39.038
She wakes up, my hands are tied.

44:39.200 --> 44:41.430
One accidental death is just that,
but two, no.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.591
I'll have no choice.

44:43.760 --> 44:46.513
I'll have to rock and roll
a home invasion,

44:46.680 --> 44:48.432
violate your wife a dozen different ways,

44:48.600 --> 44:50.830
kill you both,
burn the place to the ground.

44:52.880 --> 44:55.314
I'm sorry for that. Ed, Ed, Ed?

44:55.480 --> 44:58.950
Hey, nobody's gonna
violate your wife, okay?

44:59.440 --> 45:02.910
Aside from what that would say
about me as a human being,

45:03.520 --> 45:05.556
physiologically it's a non-starter.

45:05.760 --> 45:09.878
Sometimes I think I just say shit,
sample what comes out of my mouth.

45:11.320 --> 45:13.834
I will, however,
park a.45 in her brainpan.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.238
I honor my commitments.

45:17.840 --> 45:22.436
It's a concept you and your sticky fingers
probably find hard to grasp.

45:27.480 --> 45:29.311
Make a decision, sir.

45:40.880 --> 45:43.155
Where are you going? Sir?

45:43.920 --> 45:44.989
Sir?

45:47.120 --> 45:49.076
Stop that. Why are you doing that?
Stop that.

45:49.240 --> 45:52.073
Sir? Sir? What are you doing? Excuse me?

45:52.240 --> 45:53.878
Mr. Chilton passed away.

45:54.400 --> 45:56.436
I was told to clean up the room.

45:57.480 --> 45:58.629
What's happening?

46:00.920 --> 46:02.797
Can you give us a minute, please?

46:05.920 --> 46:07.512
This is the balance of your contract.

46:07.720 --> 46:09.600
- I understand you're upset...
- Yes, I'm upset.

46:09.680 --> 46:10.680
I haven't finished yet.

46:10.840 --> 46:12.114
Yes, you have.

46:12.760 --> 46:14.478
Ed was a diabetic for 30 years.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.760
You think he didn't know
how to check his blood sugar?

46:17.080 --> 46:19.992
Whatever unresolved issues remain,

46:20.160 --> 46:23.436
my friend was poisoned enough by them
to take his own life.

46:24.440 --> 46:26.520
As far as I'm concerned,
whatever he did is forgiven.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.076
Please. I need to finish, please.

46:29.240 --> 46:31.515
- Sorry, I'll come back.
- No, no, come in, dear.

46:32.680 --> 46:34.033
We're done.

46:35.880 --> 46:37.074
You're very good, Mr. Wolff.

46:38.160 --> 46:40.799
But I hope our paths never cross again.

46:41.480 --> 46:44.313
I'm responsible
for the death of my best friend.

46:45.200 --> 46:47.760
I'd prefer not to be reminded of it.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.276
Do you think that's true?

47:02.160 --> 47:04.116
That Mr. Chilton killed himself...

47:04.840 --> 47:06.876
I mean, do you think we're responsible?

47:07.440 --> 47:10.273
It's very hard for me to interpret
why people do what they do.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.389
I'm not finished.
I'm not finished with this.

47:18.840 --> 47:20.990
I mean, look... Look at this.

47:22.520 --> 47:24.795
See, cost reports. This is out of order.

47:24.960 --> 47:27.952
They completely rearranged this.
I don't...

47:28.480 --> 47:30.516
I'm not finished. I'm not finished...

47:35.800 --> 47:37.028
Bye, Chris.

49:03.240 --> 49:04.798
No! Mom! Mom!

49:05.000 --> 49:07.833
Mom! Mom! Mom!

49:09.640 --> 49:11.551
Why is Mom leaving?

49:11.960 --> 49:13.188
Mom!

49:54.600 --> 49:55.680
Again.

50:17.720 --> 50:18.755
Again.

50:41.080 --> 50:42.149
Enough.

50:47.520 --> 50:48.589
They're not done.

50:49.040 --> 50:52.396
Tomorrow is another day.
They have done their best.

50:53.200 --> 50:56.829
If that were true, you'd be covered
in blood and snot, not them.

50:57.960 --> 50:59.313
Keep going.

51:11.800 --> 51:15.793
Aggression, correctly channeled,
overcomes a lot of flaws.

51:17.800 --> 51:20.109
Tapping into that aggression requires

51:20.960 --> 51:23.872
peeling back several layers of yourself.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.798
It's my job to know my sons' limitations.

51:29.640 --> 51:30.834
Get up.

51:32.800 --> 51:34.119
It's your job to peel.

51:34.560 --> 51:36.596
Do your job. On your feet.

51:54.480 --> 51:55.629
Again!

52:03.360 --> 52:06.716
We could have went to his house,
shot him in his home.

52:06.880 --> 52:08.552
And we'd be on a plane by now.

52:08.720 --> 52:11.951
Or on a security camera,
or some nosy neighbor's iPhone.

52:16.080 --> 52:17.354
Call the bookkeeper in.

52:19.040 --> 52:20.496
He's just too far.
He won't hear...

52:20.520 --> 52:21.635
Now.

52:21.800 --> 52:24.519
Let's go. Get up. Come on.

52:27.200 --> 52:28.315
Move!

52:30.640 --> 52:31.993
Come on, come on, come on.

52:37.960 --> 52:39.359
Christian!

52:43.120 --> 52:44.120
Chris!

52:48.280 --> 52:50.350
Again! Louder!

52:54.080 --> 52:55.080
Up! Up!

53:00.640 --> 53:02.278
- No, no! Please!
- What the fuck?

53:02.440 --> 53:03.440
Dolores!

53:06.160 --> 53:07.195
She's coming with me.

53:07.360 --> 53:08.713
No, no, stop! Stop! Leave her...

53:15.080 --> 53:17.514
We're all going together.
Pull that truck around back.

53:17.680 --> 53:19.398
Let's go! Let's go!

53:23.240 --> 53:24.240
Let's move!

53:25.760 --> 53:27.955
Come on! Drive! Drive now!

53:38.440 --> 53:39.800
Jesus fucking Christ!

53:44.920 --> 53:46.069
God damn it!

53:49.640 --> 53:50.834
Son of a bitch!

54:30.120 --> 54:31.348
What the fuck?

54:44.760 --> 54:47.513
When I say the name of your employer,
you say "yes."

54:47.720 --> 54:48.720
Practice.

54:49.840 --> 54:50.875
Yes.

54:51.880 --> 54:52.880
Camorra.

54:53.560 --> 54:54.560
Juárez.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.194
Gambino.

54:57.080 --> 54:58.274
Do you understand the rules?

54:58.480 --> 55:00.835
My left pocket.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.911
They paid to

55:04.640 --> 55:05.834
kill you both.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.149
That's all I know.

55:29.760 --> 55:31.680
- Hello, dreamboat.
- Dana's in danger.

55:31.840 --> 55:34.400
Kill Christian Wolff,
transfer all domestic accounts overseas.

55:34.600 --> 55:36.591
- Current vehicle?
- F-150.

55:37.320 --> 55:39.470
- Virus to triple Z?
- Wipe everything.

55:41.880 --> 55:43.598
Done. In the DOT database now.

55:43.880 --> 55:45.677
Reassigning the license and VIN.

55:45.840 --> 55:48.354
I have George Boole
or Charles Babbage in the queue.

55:48.520 --> 55:50.272
Boole. Obviously.

55:50.440 --> 55:52.032
Silly of me. What else?

55:53.960 --> 55:55.313
She is not your problem.

55:55.480 --> 55:57.914
Straight to the trailer,
hook it up, and disappear.

55:58.120 --> 55:59.348
There's no time.

55:59.520 --> 56:00.839
Only the trailer.

56:02.120 --> 56:04.554
Address and phone number. Get it.

56:35.840 --> 56:37.114
She's not answering.

58:08.880 --> 58:10.080
Could have used the small box.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.038
Well, she looked bigger in the photo.

58:16.040 --> 58:17.040
God!

58:53.480 --> 58:55.152
God damn!

58:55.520 --> 58:56.520
Bitch!

58:59.400 --> 59:00.400
Fuck.

59:33.880 --> 59:35.108
We should go.

59:40.960 --> 59:43.838
Since when are accountants
difficult to ventilate?

59:45.320 --> 59:46.673
Dead?

59:46.840 --> 59:49.832
Christ! What'd he do, hit him
over the head with an adding machine?

59:54.120 --> 59:55.348
Oh, God.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.798
All right, just put me in touch
with the client.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.189
I'll handle this accountant myself.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.959
Running isn't an option for me.
I can't just walk out on my life!

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.351
We have to go to the police.
That's what normal, taxpaying people do!

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.513
Police can't protect you from someone
who can afford to return $61 million.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.496
Return?
What are you talking about, "return"?

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.272
The money was being put back.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.589
Stay here.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.320
What are you doing in here?

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.549
- Who are you?
- You can't...

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:27.835
You should not be here.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.911
Sit down. Sit right there.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.193
What is this place?

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.869
PanAmerica, Airstream.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.794
34 feet 7 inches long,

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.191
8 feet 5 inches wide.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.792
Dimensions which are perfectly adequate
for one person.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.393
Preferable, even.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.919
This is where you live?

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.913
No, I don't live here.
This is a storage unit.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.080
That would be weird.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.639
That's what would be weird?

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.189
I'd like to spend more time here.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.119
However, I'm afraid some of my clients
might follow me.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.395
Why would your clients follow you?
You're an accountant!

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.153
How do you know what to do here?
Why are you prepared for this?

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.799
Plus, this is on wheels,

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.190
which means I can hook it up
and be gone in 12 minutes.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.360
Usually.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.558
Sarcasm? Is that sarcasm?

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:21.393
No, that's not sarcasm.
I don't use sarcasm. It's irritation.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.136
Everything in the world that is
important to me is in this trailer.

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.680
And right now, changing my routine
for you is jeopardizing that.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.670
Tell me that's not an original Pollock.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.909
We should go.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.275
Now.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:01.112
- Medina.
- Miss Medina?

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.033
This is Gordon Amundson
with the FBI Language Services.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.997
Uh, yeah. Any luck?

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.276
It's an unusual audio file.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:12.035
Solomon Grundy is a nursery rhyme
circa mid-1800s.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.555
Your voice has four of
the six intonation patterns

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.551
we use to define American English.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.995
That's difficult to confirm with a rhyme.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.871
Out of curiosity,
was your subject a trauma victim?

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.957
Um, why do you ask that?

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.475
Well, you indicated on your submission

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.359
that this event occurred
in a high-stress environment?

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:32.397
Yeah. Exceptionally.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.959
That's interesting.

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.630
The verse was repeated
a total of four and a half times

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:44.035
with zero variation in pitch, span, tempo,
volume, or articulatory precision.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.918
So, what does that mean, exactly?

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.548
Well, we often see
this type of repetitive chanting

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.910
in children
who have been exposed to trauma

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.991
or persons with
neurodevelopmental disorders.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.351
Neurodevelopmental disorders?

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.755
Fragile-X syndrome, autism.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.839
Okay, so...

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.752
Let's say I was looking at mugshots.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.435
How would that present itself?
What exactly would I be looking for?

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:10.196
Fragile-X: Elongated face,
protruding ears, poor muscle tone.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.399
Autism's nearly impossible
to identify visually.

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.118
The traits are behavioral:

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.078
difficulty with
social interaction, communication,

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.077
lack of eye contact.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.114
Lack of eye contact.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.113
Okay.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.280
Good luck to you.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.440
Thanks.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:19.998
None of this makes sense.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.311
Why go through the trouble of skimming
the money if you're gonna put it back?

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.760
Over the last two years,

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:28.913
the number of invoices submitted
by Slewitt Manufacturing declined.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.639
Scared of getting caught?

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.635
Price hikes?

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.950
Prices of consumer electronics
go down, not up.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.310
Right, down, yeah.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.474
I can't afford this.

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.278
I know. My treat.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.953
In the US, 104 men,

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:53.352
last name any standard derivation
of your mathematician, Carl Gauss,

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:58.958
reported over $500,000
in any of the last seven years.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.792
Okay. Go a million plus.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.514
Seventeen.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:07.195
Of the 17,
how many between the ages of 25 and 45?

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.029
Four.

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.515
Of those four,

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:14.468
only one has an income stream
that's cash-heavy or easily laundered.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:15.789
And he

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.878
died three years ago.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:26.800
What's this?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.468
It's names of
the 100 most famous mathematicians.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.800
Look, we know what we're doing now.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:36.230
So, just enter the names,
narrow down the search right off the bat.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.833
Male, Caucasian,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.594
25 to 45, earning a million plus.

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.877
No investment income.
He'll concentrate on cash.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.354
What's in it for me?

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.876
Look, if you help me find him,

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.080
I'll see what I can do
about getting you outta here.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.428
Please.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.517
Single earner or filing jointly?

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.757
Hey, those paintings in your trailer...

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.270
- They're real, right?
- Yes.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.876
You didn't buy them at auction, did you?

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:27.758
They're a form of payment.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:29.789
Right.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.109
Hey.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.959
Thank you.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.594
At my apartment.

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:39.760
Oh.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.869
Yeah.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.432
Can we sit down for a second?

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.275
Yeah. Okay.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.640
Just...

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.275
Sit.

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:21.675
How do you, um,

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.956
know how to...

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.953
My father was an officer in the Army.
Psychological Operations.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.194
He was concerned that I might be
taken advantage of somehow,

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:39.796
so he arranged for me to train
with a number of specialists

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.313
throughout my childhood.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.393
We lived in 34 homes in 17 years.

01:08:45.399 --> 01:08:47.277
- You moved 34 times?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.551
God. That's extraordinary.

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:55.550
No, I'm sure
it must've been difficult, but...

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:57.912
I haven't been anywhere.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.031
Well, Cancun. Not my proudest moment.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:04.880
Um...

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.073
I just mean...

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:12.868
Your life is unique.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:17.073
It's not unique. I have
a high-functioning form of autism,

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.000
which means I have
an extremely narrow focus

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.078
and a hard time abandoning tasks
once I've taken them up.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.392
I have difficulty socializing
with other people, even though

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.158
I want to.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:41.071
When I was a senior in high school,
I wanted this special dress for prom.

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:42.952
I told myself that spending $100

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.895
on a trashy dress
that I was gonna wear one time

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.136
to an event that I thought was
silly in the first place, was...

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.354
- Wasteful.
- Yes.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.997
But Vera Wang
made this black, strapless classic.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:56.936
It was more expensive, but you could
wear it to all kinds of future events.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.632
- It was an investment.
- Yes.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.717
Where were you when I was in high school?

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.115
Oh, North Carolina, Israel.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.109
Right. Um...

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.196
The problem was
they wanted $1700 for this dress,

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.520
and I didn't have that, so...

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.153
- You asked your parents?
- No.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.028
Hang on.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.479
Blackjack. I'd never played a hand,

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.296
but I went to the library, and I
checked out all these books on strategy.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.840
And I turned the Naperville North
math club into a little Vegas.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.951
- What's a math club?
- Math club?

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.838
You compete against other schools.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.991
Theory and speed math.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:36.271
Like, what's 298,567 times 92?

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:41.630
27,468, 164.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:47.154
Right. Um...

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.560
Blackjack.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.551
I could tell you
when to hit, stand, split, re-split.

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:56.837
I moved on to card counting,
shuffle tracking, hole carding.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.709
And I took everything I had,
which was $183,

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.678
and I drove down to Harrah's in Joliet.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.400
Why was this dress so important to you?

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.192
It wasn't about the dress.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:13.791
I just wanted to walk into the gym
and have everybody say "Wow!"

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:19.030
I was trying to belong.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.311
I was trying to connect.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:27.240
I think no matter how different we are,
we're all trying to do the same thing.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:36.030
But I lost all but $20
in the first 10 minutes.

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.714
I fed that into a nickel slot
on the way out,

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.871
- and I won two grand.
- Hmm.

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.395
I used the extra cash to pay for a limo.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.829
Only wore the dress the one time.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.230
Chris, why are we here?

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.240
Um...

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.189
I thought this hotel
had good water pressure.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.752
The Holiday Inn Express in Aurora
has good water pressure.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.593
Yes, but these towels are very fancy,

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.633
and cheaper hotels have scratchy towels.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.479
And

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.079
I wanted you to like it.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.756
Crazy Eddie and the Panama Pump.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:48.473
Crazy Eddie Antar and the Panama Pump.
Have you ever heard of...

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.949
- What?
- Crazy Eddie Antar.

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:55.159
He owned a string of electronic stores
in New York City in the '80s.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:58.830
Crazy Eddie Antar, he started stealing
almost as soon as he opened business.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.115
Okay, I'm not following.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.952
He deposited money in Tel Aviv,

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:05.078
and then he cycled it through Panama
and put it back into his stores.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.760
Okay, why take it out and put it back?

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.957
Well, initially he was just stealing
in garden-variety tax evasion,

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.315
but then he came up with a better idea.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.391
You see, by taking his own money,

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.949
stealing it, and putting it back
on his books...

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.593
He was raining cash.

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.671
He took the company public at $8 a share.

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:23.513
A year later, it was trading at $75.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.516
- Rita's taking Living Robotics public.
- Yes.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.440
But why would she hire you
in the first place

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.630
if she thought you would figure it out?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.194
I don't know.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.193
I'll have to ask her.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.151
Whatever Rita's involvement,
it's not your concern.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.356
You disappear, I make a call.

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.397
Please. I worry about you.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:51.994
If I don't do something, Dana will die.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.515
Risking your life for a girl
you've known a week.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.680
Why?

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.553
Heavy sigh.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.199
What's the plan?

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.476
Find the person who wants to kill her.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:04.835
And?

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.793
Shoot them in the head.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.274
Last one.

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.115
Wolff, two "F" s, Christian.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.836
Two hundred and forty five men.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.670
Four with incomes over a million.

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.554
All over the age of 60. Sorry.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:41.837
Right.
Your guy's an accountant.

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:46.191
Two Christian Wolffs own CPA firms.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.193
The first Christian Wolff owns...

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:55.150
Wolff Accounting. 121 South Street,
Scottsdale, Arizona.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.199
Income of 435 grand. It's a good year.

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:03.032
So good, we audited him two years ago.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.349
He's clean.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.476
The other Christian Wolff...

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.598
Nope. Only 75 grand.

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:16.194
ZZZ Accounting.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:20.555
Wabash Way, Plainfield, Illinois.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.869
ZZZ.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.555
I mean, it's not exactly
a smart Yellow Pages move.

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.273
Wait a second.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:37.557
Who filed the returns for
Kim's Nails, Wabash Way, Plainfield?

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.233
ZZZ Accounting.
Could just be the neighborly...

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.756
Great Mandarin, Wabash.

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.909
ZZZ Accounting.

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.433
Paul's Laundromat.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.798
ZZZ Accounting.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.555
Tell me they're all
registered as partnerships.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.875
Every one.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.913
Managing partner...

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.229
Christian Wolff.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:18.557
- Christian Wolff.
- Come in.

01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:23.271
Christian Wolff, last year, ran $75,543
through his accounting firm.

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.600
Whoa. Who is Christian Wolff?

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.153
The accountant.

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.870
- 75 grand? That's chump change.
- Agreed.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:36.717
But he ran another $287765
through Kim's Nails,

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:41.510
$445,112 through Great Mandarin Chinese,
and you'll love this,

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.992
$505,909 through Paul's Laundromat.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.639
Paul's Laundromat?
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.835
He's playing with us.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.560
He can't clean that kind of money
through an accounting firm.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.193
The paper trail's too heavy.

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.136
So, he's laundering it
through cash businesses.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:59.720
All of those are in the same strip mall
south of Chicago.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.160
ZZZ?

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.471
I mean, he doesn't care about the traffic.
It's a front. All of it.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.155
Christian Wolff, Carl Gauss,
Lou "Lewis" Carroll.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.471
He's using the names
of famous mathematicians as a cover.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:18.029
Charitable contributions here
to Harbor Neuroscience.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.316
Last year alone,
that's gotta come to close to...

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:21.919
$1,000,100.

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:24.833
That one's not a cover.
That's the real deal. I checked.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.600
So, you're telling me
this guy risks his life

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:31.548
doing forensic accounting for some
of the scariest people on the planet,

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:34.240
collects his fee, goes through
all the trouble of laundering it,

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.117
and then gives almost all of it away?

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:40.678
Well, what if
he's taking other means of payment?

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.712
Yeah, possible. Yeah.

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.039
I caught him, Ray.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.028
Maybe.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.196
Pack a bag. We're going to Chicago.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.320
90% probability they're all right-handed.

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.270
Up to me, I'd snap four right wrists.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:17.115
But maybe you enjoy waiting
on a schoolyard sucker punch.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.556
Life is a series of choices,
none of which are new.

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:28.359
The oldest is choosing to be a victim.

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.192
Or choosing not to.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.790
Second oldest: loyalty.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.631
Family first, good times or bad.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.831
Bonjour, fellas.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.197
They're only glasses.

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:57.996
You think if you don't fight back,
then maybe they'll like you.

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.759
Stop picking on you, calling you "freak."

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.078
Well, here's what it is.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.232
They don't like you,
they don't dislike you.

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.433
They're afraid of you.

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.353
You're different.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.999
Sooner or later,
"different" scares people.

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.035
Victim or not? Make a decision.

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.395
Go.

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.758
You're different.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.833
Sooner or later,
"different" scares people.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.513
In here.

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.751
.357 Colt Python.

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.158
Serial number's gone.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:46.869
Hydra-Shoks.

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.917
Wireless security cam.

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.229
Infrared, weatherproof.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.278
He's got a network of 'em.

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.590
Whole backyard's got eyes.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:16.948
This is our guy.

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:20.317
So, why does a guy who's
up to his elbows in cash live here?

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:24.877
Given his clientele, he figures
blending in will extend his shelf life.

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.157
It's the smart move.

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:30.676
Well, maybe not smart enough.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:34.074
High-tech security cameras back here,

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.551
anybody could roll up in the front.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.877
How does he cover this?

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:46.235
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:55.598
Don't see that every day.

01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:00.473
Boys, let's have a situation report.

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:02.549
We good, Ike?

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.279
All clear.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:05.555
Rock and roll.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.797
And how about you, sport?

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.593
It's Bobby.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.079
I got nothing.

01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.913
Okay, yeah, I'm getting a feed
on the camera now.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.479
Move it to the left side.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.440
Is all this really necessary?

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.513
You should be watching his home.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.795
Yeah? What you think?

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.912
That's your idea on the subject?

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:31.759
Love it when people tell me
how to do my job.

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.751
I believe I recommended
you leave the country.

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.593
- You declined.
- He's an accountant!

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.675
I could see it in his eyes.
The freak wasn't gonna let it go.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.794
My best to Michelle.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.154
I will.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:06.633
I was old 10 years ago.

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.791
So, what's your story, Medina?

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.479
You know my story.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.995
I know what the courts said.

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:23.508
Stuffed a handful of cocaine
up a drug dealer's nose,

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:26.148
pistol-whipped him
into the trunk of his car.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:30.711
I was 17. It was August.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:34.915
He cooked for three days, but lived.

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.519
Do you regret it?

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:39.148
The coke was half borax.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.035
Same shit he kept selling my sister.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.992
She's a dental hygienist in Annapolis now.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.196
Married, three kids.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.433
No, I don't regret it.

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.358
That's rough.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.556
All due respect, Director King,

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.188
what the fuck do you know about "rough"?

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.916
Wait! I gotta call it in!

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.080
Move it!

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:11.878
You tell me, Medina.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:20.278
Men kill each other
for any number of reasons.

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.600
Bobby, you hear me?

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.393
Money, power...

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:25.795
Fear.

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.360
Right there, motherfucker!

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.837
Nine men would die
that day at the Ravenite,

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.188
but for none of those reasons.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:42.910
No, they'd taken something
from the man who was killing them.

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.074
Something that couldn't
be made whole again.

01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.910
Something very important to him.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.795
And he was there for his pound of flesh.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:56.473
Please.

01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:58.079
Just fucking stop, man!

01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.878
Just put the gun down!

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:03.152
Little Tony Bazzano.

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.670
I'd been wedged in a van for six months

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:09.798
listening to that arrogant little prick
belch, fart, and brag.

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.349
Please.

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:12.953
I'm fucking begging you.

01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:15.913
I didn't recognize his voice
with all the fear in it.

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:18.918
I didn't touch him.
I didn't touch that old man!

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:20.269
I wasn't even...

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.952
Our man had come for revenge.

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.799
And he got it.

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.159
Nine dead.

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.473
And I was 10.

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.075
Your name?

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.874
Ray.

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.712
Raymond King.

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.110
Who employs you, Raymond King?

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.638
I'm a Treasury agent.

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.998
Are you a good one?

01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.595
No.

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.318
No, not particularly.

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.708
Is that it?

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:08.832
Kids, I got... I'm a dad.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.513
I got two kids.

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:13.354
Grown?

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:16.989
Yeah.

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.592
Yes, yes, they're all...
They're all grown up.

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.914
Were you a good dad, Raymond King?

01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:31.154
Yeah. I've been a good dad.

01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:37.835
I'm a lousy agent,
and I've been a weak man,

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.516
but that I didn't screw up.

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:44.672
That I got right.

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.079
Imagine you're a Treasury agent

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:04.438
approaching the twilight
of a spectacularly dismal career.

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:10.596
And then one day, that break
you should have been looking for.

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.877
Francis Silverberg, a black money legend.

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:17.555
Cleaned cash from Monte Carlo
to Havana to Vegas.

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:22.793
He cooked the books for the Gambino family
for 40-plus years.

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.394
Until one day, the boss, Big Tony Bazzano,

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:29.075
thought maybe the old man's age
made him vulnerable to prosecution.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:32.277
Ordered his son, Little Tony,
to kill Francis.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.274
Kid fucked it up.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:38.672
Francis ran, became a federal informant
in return for protective custody.

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:41.948
Could have turned my career around

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.758
if only I'd listened.

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:46.908
I didn't.

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:51.155
He was processed out,
and he lost the only protection he had.

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.816
Stand clear of the gate.

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:57.755
The protection that he was promised
when he testified against Big Tony.

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:03.633
And this time, Little Tony got it right.

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.596
He had Francis in a couple hours.

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.999
Down in a filthy basement in the Bronx,
nailed to a chair,

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.437
tortured to death.

01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:23.116
So, I volunteered for a joint task force.

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:26.552
Sat outside the Ravenite
in a surveillance van for months

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:29.837
hoping to get a shred of evidence
to use against Francis' killers.

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:34.640
Wait! Wait!

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.115
I gotta call it in!

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:38.955
Move it!

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.628
I went in there
hoping I could ease my guilt.

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.632
And I met our accountant.

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:50.039
Why he let me live, I didn't know.

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:53.278
But he changed my life.

01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:58.676
Gave my notice at the Department.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.320
I started looking forward
to the day again.

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:05.199
You know, feeling the sun on my face.

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:07.319
Quit drinking.

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:09.677
Was on my way out the door...

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.833
And then, the phone rang.

01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:14.520
Ray King.

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.159
I'll never forget that voice.

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:18.555
Do you like puzzles, Raymond King?

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:23.195
She tells me she works for the accountant.

01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:27.436
And that a shipping container
packed with Chinese nationals

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:30.273
is passing through the Port of New York.

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.433
Few months later,

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:36.752
one ton of uncut Juárez cartel product
is entering Miami.

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.519
All those cases you put together...

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:44.359
Smoke and mirrors.

01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:49.713
So, who is he?

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:52.240
This accountant.

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:56.109
Prisoner 831.
Fort Leavenworth, maximum security.

01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.548
Military prison?

01:33:58.560 --> 01:33:59.879
So, he was in the Army?

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:04.472
Army lent him to us to track
al-Qaeda money launderers.

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:09.235
He was transferred from Leavenworth
to our detention center in D. C.

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.711
Did the work of five men.

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.111
Data mining, cluster analysis.

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:19.278
He roomed with Francis.

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.439
They kept to themselves, played chess,

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:26.070
ate together, sat in the TV room together.

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:28.953
They were inseparable.

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.278
And then one day, a guard told Wolff

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:35.796
why Francis hadn't called or written
since he got out.

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:40.234
That his burnt body had been found
in a Staten Island landfill.

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:45.396
Wolff snapped, went after the guard.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:48.752
He fractured the man's skull
with a thermos.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.511
Escaped from a third-floor window.

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.273
Took the thermos.

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:58.196
That's all you got? I mean, Leavenworth,
he'll have military records...

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.032
Records are all heavily redacted.

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:01.952
Well, then arrest records, something?

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:06.479
Spring of 2003, at a funeral home
in Kankakee, Illinois.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:12.192
Our boy sends six locals to the hospital
with a variety of injuries.

01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:15.313
No one knew Wolff.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.278
The older man who came with him
was identified as a colonel, US Army.

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:23.799
A funeral home.

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:25.799
Whose wake?

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.190
One customer that day.

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.516
Mrs. Lauren Alton.

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:39.793
Mrs. Alton taught first grade
for 13 years in Kankakee.

01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:43.476
Survived by a husband
and two boys, ages 12 and 10.

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:48.031
By all accounts,
an ordinary life, well lived.

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.319
But cut short.

01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:52.674
It'll be all right.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.400
Excuse me, sir, this is

01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:57.669
family only.

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.833
Sir, I'm going to ask you
to step outside.

01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:06.752
And then a fight breaks out.
A brawl, really.

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:10.071
Over what,
the authorities never pinned down.

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:11.349
Get your hands...

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.199
Deputies respond.

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:22.756
A Barney Fife-type squares off
with our boy, gets rattled, pulls his gun.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:26.875
The colonel just stepped in front of 831.

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:30.393
Army collects both men.

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:34.198
Police report names Wolff
as "Soldier One."

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.598
And widower
identified the colonel by name.

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:40.350
His late wife's former husband.

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.791
I checked. It's an alias.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.909
No more real than "Christian Wolff."

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:52.279
She was the dead colonel's ex-wife.

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.394
And you think Wolff is what to him?

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:07.311
Were you a good dad, Ray King?

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:19.753
I've given up trying to figure out
when I'll get a call.

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:22.753
The "why" though, that I've got.

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:25.950
Someone breaks his moral code.

01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.116
Why are you telling me this?

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:41.351
I'm retiring in a few months.

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.832
When she calls,

01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:49.148
somebody needs to be there to answer.

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.109
No.

01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:10.192
He's a criminal, Ray.

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.469
Yeah.

01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:14.791
He aids and abets drug cartels,
money launderers.

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:17.870
He's a fucking killer.

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.394
Believe me,
I wrestled with the same decision.

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.993
But when I got that first call,

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.631
I realized something.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.518
I'd spent my whole life only recognizing
my lucky breaks after they were gone.

01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.233
The Brit, who is she?

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.269
Hello?

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.839
Miss Medina.

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.993
Tell Eliot Ness to get his feet
off the furniture.

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.037
He's not in a barn.

01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.194
Living Robotics.

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:14.433
Write it down.

01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:21.308
North of six feet, short hair,
athletic build, yes?

01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.440
- Correct.
- But when you say short hair,

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:25.856
you mean short hair like my hair,
or you mean short hair like...

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.029
What's the difference?

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.872
I was told you could fix this, so fix it!

01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:31.360
But you did speak to the man, am I right?
You spoke to him?

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:32.589
What did he sound like?

01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:36.036
I didn't make small talk.
What's it matter what he sounded...

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.871
That's Ike, right? That's the north side?

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.551
Yo, Bobby, was that you?

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:45.560
Bob.

01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:51.628
Bobby.

01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:54.389
Ike, are you there?

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.149
Ike?

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:01.228
Guys, stop fucking around.
Someone answer me. Ike?

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:03.072
Pull was to the left.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:06.755
You might consider using a round
with a superior ballistic coefficient.

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:11.432
Give me the layout of the home.

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:14.831
Points of entry, corridors, rooms, cover.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Go.

01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.239
Fuck.

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:22.800
- Sit down.
- What's this...

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.711
Shut up. Sit down in the chair.

01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:56.635
You ever see a match-grade round traveling
3,000 feet per second go through a window?

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.069
Nobody does.

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.389
Get down, now!

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:40.671
Four men, front entrance.

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:43.118
Go right at him. Go now.

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:49.720
You...

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:51.789
I got the cameras.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.592
Go join your friends.

01:41:58.520 --> 01:41:59.520
Up.

01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:03.480
Clear.

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:17.760
Smoke.

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:43.953
Go, go!

01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:46.195
Go, go!

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:03.752
Attack front entry!

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.399
Man down!

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:09.000
Guys, talk to me.

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.351
You got eyes on who it is?

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:18.600
Someone talk to me.
Let me know what the sitrep is.

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:40.028
Are they dead?

01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:47.315
Give me a situation report.
How many down?

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:49.719
Are they dead? Answer me!

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:54.914
Okay, he's on the roof.
Start forming up. Let's move.

01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:56.758
Check skylights, check windows.

01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:58.000
That motherfucker comes in,

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.628
I wanna hear gunshots
and I wanna hear "target eliminated."

01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:13.520
That's enough. He's in the goddamn house.

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.435
Get out there and end this!

01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:18.400
Brax, give me a situation report.
Have you got eyes on anything?

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.032
What's happening?

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.119
Say something!

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.997
Solomon Grundy
Born on a Monday

01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:55.268
Christened on Tuesday
Married on Wednesday

01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.312
Sick on Thursday
Worse on Friday

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:05.393
Died on Saturday
Buried on Sunday

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.479
"And that was the end of Solomon Grundy"

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:15.752
What is this?

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:38.200
Hey! Hey!

01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:39.429
Stand down!

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:40.675
Fuck off!

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.078
Hello, Braxton.

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.069
No, no.

01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:29.035
Don't...

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:31.439
Don't do that...

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.376
Been looking for you for 10 years,

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:38.616
and you're gonna come at me
like we just saw each other yesterday?

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:40.278
That's what you're gonna do?

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:41.669
What did I...

01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:44.118
What'd I think?

01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:47.750
What'd I think? That you were gonna be
happy to see me, I guess.

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:50.959
I am happy.

01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:58.032
I need to finish.

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.269
You should go.

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:02.873
I should go?

01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:05.434
Okay...

01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:07.918
Okay, I'll just go.

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:11.075
But first, I'm gonna ask you a question.

01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:12.639
You're gonna give me an answer.

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:15.760
Why would you and Pop go to that funeral?

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:17.440
She left us. Do you not remember that?

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.158
Do you not remember that?

01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:29.436
It's your fault that Pop's dead!
You hear me?

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:30.600
It's your fault!

01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:32.557
- I'm sorry, Braxton.
- Sorry?

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:34.631
Sorry doesn't cut it, you weird fuck!

01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:59.953
You don't give a shit about me?
You don't give a shit about me?

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.633
How about now?

01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:10.915
How about now?

01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:19.117
Are you gonna fight?

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:22.509
Fight!

01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:16.598
I'm sorry, Braxton.

01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:22.430
If you had to see her,

01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:26.999
if that was something that you had to do,

01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:29.273
you call me.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.878
I'm your brother.
I've always had your back.

01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:36.235
You don't call him, you call me.

01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:44.791
Did you even wonder where I was?

01:51:44.960 --> 01:51:46.598
I knew where you were.

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.716
I just wanted you to be safe.

01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:51.518
Some of my clients

01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:53.639
are quite dangerous.

01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:00.039
I'm, kind of, considered
fairly dangerous myself.

01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:03.712
Well, you've made improvements.

01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:13.913
Shit, man.

01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:16.798
You and me here...

01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:19.119
What are the odds?

01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:20.474
Statistically speaking...

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:22.631
Christ, man! It's rhetorical.

01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:24.637
I mean, really?

01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:27.199
I was just saying.

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:33.436
Not happy.

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:37.276
Do you consider
what you do important, Mr. Wolff?

01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:39.749
To someone other than yourself, I mean?

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:42.230
What I do is.

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:46.839
Living Robotics' public offering
would've been worth billions.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.958
Money to be used
for neuroprosthetics, nanotechnology.

01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:51.155
You...

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:55.475
Why in God's name did I ever hire you?

01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:57.471
To leak-proof your books.

01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:01.833
Dana found a mistake, and you wanted
to be sure it was safe to go public.

01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:04.112
And now you want to kill her.

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:05.429
I'm fond of Dana.

01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:08.520
But I restore lives, not Dana! Me!

01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:12.719
Men, women, children,
I give them hope. Make them whole.

01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:14.438
Do you even know what that's like?

01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:15.868
Yes, I do.

01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:31.509
Sorry.

01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:36.879
I missed you.

01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:45.792
"Missed you, too, Braxton.

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.231
"Missed you, too, because I love you.

01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:53.072
"You're my brother."

01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:56.908
Maybe...

01:53:57.680 --> 01:53:59.272
Do you want to...

01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:02.231
Maybe I could see you in a week?

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:04.595
You name the place. I'll be there.

01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:20.352
How will I find you?

01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:22.953
You won't.

01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:25.192
I'll find you.

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:32.320
There.

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:35.438
How do you respond to rumors

01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:38.956
that some of the victims have wounds
consistent with anti-aircraft rounds?

01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:40.951
I'd say the Chicago Police Department

01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.112
has ample experience
solving all manner of homicides.

01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:47.635
Tom.

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.796
Sir, how are the conspiracy
and fraud charges

01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:52.679
related to the deaths of Lamar Blackburn
and his sister, Rita?

01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:54.990
This is a very fluid situation

01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:59.115
with a lot of surprising revelations
over the last 48 hours.

01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:02.915
Let me introduce you to the person
leading the investigation...

01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:05.155
Agent Medina.

01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:16.675
Um...

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:18.188
Good afternoon.

01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:24.917
As much as I'd like
to take credit for this,

01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.752
I can't.

01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:37.714
Because this was a team effort

01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:42.558
comprised of long hours
of good old-fashioned investigative work.

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:43.720
Questions?

01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:53.552
He was just like our other two.
He was a happy baby.

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:56.548
Now he rarely speaks.

01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:59.634
It's like our child is missing.
He's not there.

01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:02.189
He's lost, and he needs our help.

01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:04.873
We thought...

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:07.879
We thought...

01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:10.713
We hoped that he would catch back up.

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:12.868
But he didn't.

01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:15.110
One in 68 children in this country

01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:18.278
are diagnosed with a form of autism.

01:56:18.440 --> 01:56:19.953
But if you can put aside for a moment

01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:23.755
what your pediatrician and all
the other NTs have said about your son...

01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:25.239
What? NTs?

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:27.597
Neurotypicals.

01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:29.438
The rest of us.

01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:32.312
What if we're wrong?

01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:34.990
What if we've been using the wrong tests

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:38.470
to quantify intelligence
in children with autism?

01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:41.638
Your son's not less-than.

01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:44.599
He's different.

01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:49.313
Now, your expectations for your son
may change over time.

01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:53.911
They might include
marriage, children, self-sufficiency.

01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:55.638
And they might not.

01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:57.795
But I guarantee you,

01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:01.794
if we let the world set expectations
for our children, they'll start low...

01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:04.999
And they'll stay there.

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:10.353
Maybe your son's capable of
much more than we know.

01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:13.758
And maybe,

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.116
just maybe,

01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:17.952
he doesn't understand how to tell us.

01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:21.273
Or...

01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:24.874
We haven 't yet learned how to listen.

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:53.715
Honey, for the hundredth time,
don't wander off like that.

01:57:54.160 --> 01:57:56.515
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. It's fine.

01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:58.636
Can he visit with you
for a while, Justine?

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:03.149
Okay, good. Come on, folks.
I'll give you the nickel tour.

01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:04.355
You okay with that?

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:06.512
It's okay, hon. Come on.

01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:08.392
No, they'll be fine.

01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:13.349
Justine's one of
our few full-time residents.

01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:15.835
She stopped talking 30 years ago.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.514
Communicates with
a digital translator now.

01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:21.157
Doctor, how is Harbor funded?

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:24.716
We're fortunate to have
very generous private donors.

01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:26.199
I'll say they're generous.

01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:27.600
Oh, why is that?

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.512
That woman, Justine...

01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:31.910
- Yeah, my daughter.
- She's your daughter?

01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:34.350
The reason I started the institute.

01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:37.274
Justine's computer, it's a BX32.

01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:39.516
Water-cooled, 12 core.

01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:42.520
Oh, that's right.
You're a software engineer.

01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:46.434
Well, some of our donors
are more generous than others.

01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:48.596
Why? Is that a good computer?

01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:50.394
Good?

01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:53.633
Doc, she could backdoor
the Pentagon with that rig.

01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:59.394
Hello, dreamboat. Shall we chat?

01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:27.308
- Hi.

01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:33.274

- Thanks.
