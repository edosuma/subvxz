02:27.002 --> 02:30.720
In the dark days at the dawn
of the 16th century,

02:30.805 --> 02:33.348
the conquering hordes
of the Turkish Sultan

02:33.474 --> 02:36.601
spread terror
throughout the civilized world.

02:36.685 --> 02:40.313
The Ottoman Empire swept
east across Asia Minor,

02:40.356 --> 02:42.732
south across the Mediterranean,

02:42.817 --> 02:44.901
north across the Crimea.

02:45.528 --> 02:49.572
Triumphant, the Turkish Sultan
turned west to the Ukraine.

02:49.657 --> 02:53.701
Turkish spearheads threatened
the frontiers of Poland.

02:53.786 --> 02:58.206
The fate of Europe hung in the balance
on the vast fertile plains

02:58.249 --> 03:00.250
known as the Steppes.

03:16.935 --> 03:19.478
Your Highness,
the Turks have broken our lines.

03:19.563 --> 03:20.771
Call out the reserves.

03:20.856 --> 03:23.148
We have yet to hear from our allies.

03:23.232 --> 03:24.357
The Cossacks.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.069
The whole army's probably
lying drunk in the mud.

03:27.112 --> 03:30.281
-The Cossacks will be here.
-We can't wait, Sire.

03:34.911 --> 03:36.494
Zaporozhtzi.

04:11.406 --> 04:14.743
Cutthroats, animals.
Devils with scalp locks.

04:15.620 --> 04:18.495
But there are no such fighters
in the world.

04:46.400 --> 04:50.612
Prince Grigory will toast victory
at the Royal Pavilion

04:50.655 --> 04:52.489
with the Cossack Colonel.

04:52.531 --> 04:53.531
Tell your Prince,

04:53.616 --> 04:57.452
the hetman of the Zaporozhtzi
only drinks with kings.

04:58.412 --> 04:59.621
My Colonel,

04:59.664 --> 05:02.667
have a drink for me with Prince Grigory.

05:02.751 --> 05:05.961
And you will represent me
at the Royal Pavilion,

05:06.003 --> 05:07.420
Taras Bulba.

05:20.059 --> 05:21.351
Follow me.

05:21.435 --> 05:24.272
Never set foot under a Polish roof.

05:25.816 --> 05:27.149
Not even a tent.

05:27.192 --> 05:31.696
Colonel Manfred, we will speak here.
It will spare us both embarrassment.

05:32.488 --> 05:36.492
I give you a toast to our common
triumph over the infidels.

05:36.535 --> 05:38.369
I'll drink to that.

05:39.288 --> 05:40.496
Gold.

05:40.872 --> 05:43.958
Too bad we're fighting
on the same side, huh?

05:45.460 --> 05:47.503
You fight well, Cossack.

05:47.546 --> 05:49.213
How are you known?

05:50.048 --> 05:52.675
Armed guards behind my back.

06:02.060 --> 06:03.477
Your name?

06:03.562 --> 06:04.979
Taras Bulba.

06:05.731 --> 06:07.606
Colonel of the Oumansky Cossacks.

06:07.691 --> 06:11.028
Well, Taras Bulba,
Colonel of the Oumansky Cossacks,

06:11.446 --> 06:14.990
His Majesty is pleased
by the results of our alliance.

06:15.616 --> 06:17.742
So pleased he has decided
to do you the honor

06:17.826 --> 06:21.912
of integrating all Cossack troops
into the Polish-Imperial Army.

06:26.044 --> 06:28.420
Do you see this scalp lock?

06:28.504 --> 06:31.339
That means you're speaking
to the Zaporozhtzi.

06:31.423 --> 06:34.259
Do you know what Zaporozhtzi means?

06:34.302 --> 06:36.428
The Cossack Brotherhood.

06:37.347 --> 06:38.513
Free men.

06:38.598 --> 06:41.933
We fought with you
to rid this land of the Turks

06:42.685 --> 06:44.769
because this is our land.

06:45.938 --> 06:49.441
Now take your Polish honor back to Poland

06:50.276 --> 06:52.152
and leave us alone.

06:52.236 --> 06:54.613
Leave us alone, Pole.

06:54.655 --> 06:59.160
Colonel Manfred, the Cossack is right.
Honor has nothing to do with this.

06:59.952 --> 07:03.330
We need the Ukraine
as a buffer against the East

07:03.414 --> 07:05.457
and we need your grain.

07:05.541 --> 07:07.959
We are here and we intend to stay.

07:08.461 --> 07:12.924
That is why His Imperial Majesty
is dispersing the Cossack troops

07:12.966 --> 07:15.884
before you can turn
your horses against us.

07:27.106 --> 07:31.817
That is why we held back our reserves
till you had won the battle for us.

08:02.808 --> 08:04.225
Zaporozhtzi !

09:35.611 --> 09:36.903
Holy Father,

09:38.738 --> 09:41.407
blessed archangel, what have we done?

09:43.118 --> 09:44.869
What is your will?

09:44.954 --> 09:49.290
I've led you to dishonor,
defeat and death.

09:49.333 --> 09:50.542
No.

09:53.879 --> 09:55.964
Devil take you, Mykola.

09:57.716 --> 09:59.467
You are our hetman.

10:00.427 --> 10:02.804
You did not lead us to defeat.

10:03.556 --> 10:05.808
We trusted the Poles.

10:06.851 --> 10:08.101
That

10:08.811 --> 10:10.436
was our mistake.

10:11.814 --> 10:13.815
Before the moon changes,

10:15.025 --> 10:17.152
I'm going to have a son.

10:18.572 --> 10:20.531
He may already be born.

10:21.449 --> 10:25.535
And I will kiss the Devil before my son

10:26.495 --> 10:28.497
wears the Polish collar.

10:29.416 --> 10:30.416
So,

10:30.792 --> 10:32.334
start again,

10:32.877 --> 10:34.545
burn our farms,

10:35.672 --> 10:37.589
take to the forests,

10:37.673 --> 10:39.507
live in the hills.

10:40.010 --> 10:41.844
Kubenko in the south.

10:42.596 --> 10:44.597
Tymoshevsky in the east.

10:46.141 --> 10:48.350
The scalp lock is forbidden.

10:56.192 --> 10:57.901
There's my pledge.

11:00.864 --> 11:02.615
It may take years,

11:03.576 --> 11:05.951
it may take a whole generation,

11:06.328 --> 11:09.330
but the Cossack Brotherhood
will rise again,

11:09.372 --> 11:11.290
with fire and sword

11:11.374 --> 11:14.126
and repay the Pole measure for measure.

11:18.549 --> 11:19.966
And take

11:20.467 --> 11:22.176
the Steppes back

11:23.762 --> 11:25.262
for our own.

11:26.556 --> 11:28.725
And may God help us.

11:29.977 --> 11:31.394
Zaporozhtzi,

11:31.896 --> 11:33.813
pray to your archangel.

12:27.953 --> 12:29.578
With the burning of their farms,

12:29.621 --> 12:33.123
the Cossacks scattered
across their beloved Steppes.

12:33.165 --> 12:35.291
There, in the ancient hills,

12:35.376 --> 12:40.631
Taras Bulba's vision was to take root
and grow like the sons he bore,

12:40.716 --> 12:44.051
steeled from birth for the day
when the Cossack Brotherhood

12:44.136 --> 12:47.470
would drive the Polish conquerors
from their homeland

12:47.555 --> 12:50.266
and take back the Steppes for their own.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.714
There, Andrei,

14:02.757 --> 14:04.508
there's your lesson.

14:04.550 --> 14:07.302
Armor plate can stop a saber.

14:08.137 --> 14:11.766
If you want to kill a man in armor,
what you need is this.

14:21.859 --> 14:24.278
Why don't Cossacks wear armor?

14:24.363 --> 14:27.240
This is our armor, boy.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.074
Faith.

14:29.951 --> 14:32.202
And a good saber arm.

14:40.587 --> 14:42.755
Ostap, watch your brother.

14:47.010 --> 14:50.263
He rides like a Cossack,
fights like a Cossack.

14:50.347 --> 14:54.100
And soon, we'll teach him
to drink like a Cossack.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.102
Taras Zaporozhtzi !

15:01.024 --> 15:04.443
When you see a Cossack
with him is a Cossack

15:04.528 --> 15:07.405
We the brotherhood we are one

15:07.447 --> 15:09.449
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!

15:09.492 --> 15:11.451
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!

15:11.536 --> 15:14.871
We the brotherhood we are one
Hey!

15:14.955 --> 15:17.999
Turn to your left then turn to your right

15:18.083 --> 15:21.628
And faces shine brighter than the sun

15:21.713 --> 15:23.589
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!

15:23.631 --> 15:25.299
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!

15:25.341 --> 15:28.926
Faces shine brighter than the sun
Hey!

15:28.969 --> 15:32.471
When you say Cossack
you're saying brother

15:32.514 --> 15:35.392
Cossack and brother mean the same

15:35.476 --> 15:37.477
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!

15:37.520 --> 15:39.229
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!

15:39.314 --> 15:42.565
Cossack and brother mean the same!
Hey!

15:42.649 --> 15:46.194
We are the Cossacks
We are the Cossacks

15:46.279 --> 15:49.615
Men that no one on earth can tame

15:49.657 --> 15:51.325
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!

15:51.367 --> 15:53.160
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!

15:53.202 --> 15:55.578
Men that no one on earth can tame

16:00.627 --> 16:01.919
Taras?

16:05.506 --> 16:06.840
In the holy name, are you mad?

16:06.925 --> 16:10.093
-A Cossack scalp lock?
-Don't chatter, magpie.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.637
You make the barber nervous.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.055
You'll be hanged on sight.

16:13.139 --> 16:16.058
The more you talk,
the more you show your ignorance.

16:16.142 --> 16:19.561
The scalp lock is the latest fashion
imported from the court at Warsaw,

16:19.646 --> 16:21.564
His Polish Majesty
has forgiven us our sins.

16:21.649 --> 16:23.900
Royal pardon to all Cossacks.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.361
Watch what you're doing.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.989
Shave me when you're through with papa.
I want a scalp lock.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.492
How's that?

16:33.410 --> 16:34.994
A scalp lock!

16:35.704 --> 16:38.581
You'll wear a scalp lock
when you've earned it, boy.

16:38.666 --> 16:40.040
In battle.

16:42.126 --> 16:45.046
You don't need a scalp lock to study Latin.

16:45.547 --> 16:46.756
Latin?

16:47.424 --> 16:50.718
The Poles have opened
the Kiev Academy to all Cossacks,

16:50.803 --> 16:54.763
and the sons of Taras Bulba
will be the first ones there.

16:55.516 --> 16:57.225
Right, Father Mikhail?

16:57.309 --> 16:59.227
The devil we are!

16:59.311 --> 17:00.561
The King is spitting in our eye.

17:00.604 --> 17:04.398
He's saying the Cossacks
aren't worth worrying about anymore.

17:04.817 --> 17:06.734
What the devil are you doing up there?

17:06.778 --> 17:08.778
I am repairing the weathercock

17:08.862 --> 17:11.781
so that you can tell
which way the wind blows.

17:11.865 --> 17:14.617
Papa, what can we learn from the Poles?

17:14.702 --> 17:18.914
Father Mikhail has taught us
everything that a Cossack should know.

17:20.083 --> 17:21.750
-A Cossack?
-Yes.

17:22.419 --> 17:24.127
What do you know?

17:24.211 --> 17:25.294
Pots and pans.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.839
Petticoats and apron strings.
That's what you know.

17:27.923 --> 17:30.884
A Cossack should be fighting Poles,
that's what I know.

17:30.927 --> 17:33.429
Send me to Kiev with a saber,
I'll teach them what I know.

17:33.471 --> 17:36.140
But I won't go to learn to be a Pole.

17:51.364 --> 17:54.158
You think you are ready to fight me, boy?

17:59.330 --> 18:01.290
Anytime you say, Papa.

18:48.631 --> 18:50.297
All right, Papa.

19:00.810 --> 19:02.060
Come on.

19:05.314 --> 19:06.564
So we go,

19:07.149 --> 19:10.527
the sons of Taras Bulba,
to learn to be Poles.

19:11.112 --> 19:14.697
I don't know why we go, Papa,
but I follow your orders

19:14.740 --> 19:18.327
until the day comes
that I can throw you in the well.

19:18.370 --> 19:19.536
And

19:20.037 --> 19:21.746
that day will come.

19:22.206 --> 19:23.373
So. . .

19:24.375 --> 19:26.709
You don't know why you're going.

19:28.547 --> 19:31.132
So you say you want to fight the Poles.

19:32.634 --> 19:34.384
When you come home,

19:34.969 --> 19:37.554
when you've learned
everything the Poles know

19:37.596 --> 19:40.391
and all there is to know about the Poles,

19:41.351 --> 19:43.894
then you'll be ready to fight them,

19:44.312 --> 19:45.896
and not before.

19:50.735 --> 19:52.736
And that day will come.

19:55.824 --> 19:57.658
That day will come.

21:22.411 --> 21:25.706
Pigs, lepers and Cossacks around the back.

23:27.455 --> 23:28.830
Follow me.

23:46.350 --> 23:47.809
Andrei Bulba.

23:48.394 --> 23:49.811
Ostap Bulba.

23:50.354 --> 23:52.313
We have opened our schools to you

23:52.398 --> 23:56.651
in the hope that we may yet raise
a generation of civilized Cossacks,

23:57.319 --> 24:01.030
worthy to be counted among
the subjects of the Polish crown.

24:01.407 --> 24:04.117
Let it be clear from the start,

24:04.159 --> 24:08.538
we will not tolerate the barbaric
behavior to which you are accustomed.

24:11.166 --> 24:14.669
You will remove your tunics
and prostrate yourselves.

24:23.053 --> 24:24.971
Brother Bartholomew.

26:37.898 --> 26:40.316
I thought we came here to study.

26:40.986 --> 26:45.322
Papa said we should learn everything
there is to know about the Poles.

26:45.365 --> 26:47.658
But she's the governor's daughter.

26:47.701 --> 26:49.784
She'd spit on a Cossack.

27:07.387 --> 27:08.470
Amo,

27:09.014 --> 27:10.014
amas,

27:10.348 --> 27:11.515
amat.

27:14.477 --> 27:15.728
I love,

27:16.397 --> 27:17.855
thou lovest,

27:18.815 --> 27:20.149
he loves.

27:25.363 --> 27:27.699
Rise ye shepherds

27:27.742 --> 27:29.951
on this winter's night

27:30.703 --> 27:32.870
In the skies

27:32.954 --> 27:36.248
one wondrous star shines bright

27:36.708 --> 27:39.252
Angel voices bid ye rise

27:39.337 --> 27:42.339
Oh come ye all where Jesus lies

27:42.381 --> 27:46.675
Oh come and greet your Lord!

27:47.886 --> 27:50.512
Come, ye shepherds

27:50.555 --> 27:53.016
Ye have traveled far

27:53.476 --> 27:56.102
Ye have been guided

27:56.187 --> 27:58.813
By his holy star

27:59.315 --> 28:02.232
Gently, gently dawn is creeping

28:02.275 --> 28:05.070
In the manger he is sleeping

28:05.112 --> 28:10.450
Come and greet your Lord

28:11.285 --> 28:13.828
Rise, ye shepherds

28:13.913 --> 28:16.873
on this winter's night

28:16.916 --> 28:22.253
In the skies
one wondrous star shines bright

28:22.922 --> 28:28.344
Angel voices bid ye rise
Oh come ye all where Jesus lies

28:28.428 --> 28:34.140
Oh come and greet your Lord

28:34.225 --> 28:35.600
Oh, Natalia,

28:35.685 --> 28:39.313
your brother and I
would like to share a toast with you.

29:14.057 --> 29:15.474
Whoa, there!

30:37.726 --> 30:40.644
Do you think it's funny
to run people down?

30:41.729 --> 30:43.146
I'm sorry.

30:45.691 --> 30:48.194
You look so funny when you get angry.

30:48.237 --> 30:51.364
It's hard to look angry
with mud on your face.

30:59.873 --> 31:01.874
That's the Academy bell.

31:04.586 --> 31:06.254
You will be late.

31:08.923 --> 31:10.716
They will whip you.

31:20.227 --> 31:23.354
-I'll return this.
-Oh, it doesn't matter.

31:23.939 --> 31:25.231
Tomorrow.

31:26.316 --> 31:27.441
No.

31:28.277 --> 31:29.569
Please.

31:31.154 --> 31:33.155
I won't be here tomorrow.

31:37.828 --> 31:40.288
But I can easily get another one,

31:41.582 --> 31:43.499
at the Thieves' Market.

31:53.010 --> 31:54.302
Joseph.

32:03.229 --> 32:04.479
Andrei. . .

32:04.564 --> 32:06.398
Andrei, come on.

32:39.974 --> 32:42.851
Come on, Andrei, the gates are closed.

32:45.022 --> 32:47.690
-The Thieves' Market.
-What did you say?

32:49.526 --> 32:51.360
The gates are closed.

33:05.083 --> 33:06.291
Veni.

33:06.376 --> 33:07.752
Vidi.

33:07.836 --> 33:09.045
Vici.

33:10.714 --> 33:12.340
I came.

33:12.383 --> 33:13.633
I saw.

33:15.719 --> 33:17.136
I conquered.

33:24.561 --> 33:28.189
Make yourselves presentable.
Then report to the Abbot.

33:36.615 --> 33:39.659
Ostap Bulba, you're dismissed.
Go to your studies.

33:39.743 --> 33:43.455
I'm sure that'll be more painful for you
than any flogging.

33:45.125 --> 33:48.918
Do you know why I have decided
to punish you and not your brother?

33:49.003 --> 33:51.838
It's the Machiavellian theory
of statesmanship you taught us.

33:51.922 --> 33:53.589
Divide your enemy and conquer.

33:53.674 --> 33:57.136
Ostap was born a Cossack,
he will die a Cossack.

33:57.220 --> 33:59.513
But you distress me, Andrei.

33:59.597 --> 34:00.889
You have a fine mind.

34:00.932 --> 34:03.516
It distresses you
to find a Cossack can think?

34:03.600 --> 34:06.979
On the contrary,
you gave me hope for the Cossack kind.

34:07.063 --> 34:10.482
To raise yourself out of ignorance
and barbarism.

34:10.567 --> 34:13.652
There's a real challenge
for a restless spirit.

34:14.404 --> 34:17.405
Must you waste yourself hating all Poles?

34:20.284 --> 34:21.869
Not all Poles.

34:23.204 --> 34:25.998
It's not so much that I hate Poles, sir.

34:27.625 --> 34:29.460
I love the Steppes.

34:29.503 --> 34:31.629
But the Steppes are Poland.

34:32.380 --> 34:34.297
The past is dead.

34:34.340 --> 34:39.053
The wheel of history moves forward
and no one can turn it back single-handed.

34:39.554 --> 34:41.723
Not even you, Andrei Bulba.

34:42.224 --> 34:45.226
Well, it's a challenge for a restless spirit.

34:47.270 --> 34:50.188
Remove your cassock
and prostrate yourself.

34:58.949 --> 35:00.700
Brother Bartholomew.

38:41.591 --> 38:43.050
Tomorrow?

38:43.093 --> 38:44.176
Where?

38:44.219 --> 38:46.595
After vespers. At the cathedral.

39:01.112 --> 39:03.030
-Are you out of your mind?
-Yes.

39:03.072 --> 39:04.573
And she loves me.

39:04.615 --> 39:06.491
And as soon as we can get out
of this monk's trap

39:06.576 --> 39:07.867
she's going to be my wife.

39:07.909 --> 39:09.660
Do you know what Papa would do to her?

39:09.745 --> 39:11.872
He'll throw her to the pigs for slop.

39:11.914 --> 39:15.459
Andrei, she's a Pole.
Don't let her make a fool of you.

40:02.591 --> 40:05.093
This Cossack dishonored my sister.

40:05.968 --> 40:09.389
We cannot allow him
to disgrace any more Polish families.

40:09.473 --> 40:12.266
Gentlemen, I'll need your assistance.

40:53.559 --> 40:56.186
I'm not going to kill you, Cossack,

40:57.021 --> 40:58.689
but I'm going to make sure

40:58.773 --> 41:02.734
you never molest another Polish woman
as long as you live.

41:04.236 --> 41:05.778
Stand him up.

42:31.158 --> 42:32.242
Stop the Cossacks!

42:32.284 --> 42:35.161
-Brother Bartholomew!
-Brother Bartholomew!

42:48.968 --> 42:50.385
Open the door!

42:50.469 --> 42:52.011
Open the door!

42:52.973 --> 42:55.099
They killed Captain Alex.

43:11.157 --> 43:15.285
-The stables. We'll need horses.
-I'll find Natalia. Saddle three.

43:39.561 --> 43:42.314
Thank you, Lieutenant, for coming here.

43:42.356 --> 43:44.607
It was considerate of you.

43:44.691 --> 43:46.150
Please wait.

43:48.403 --> 43:50.029
My son is dead.

43:50.071 --> 43:52.907
Your brother killed by your Cossack lover.

43:52.992 --> 43:55.410
Tell your servant to pack your belongings.

43:55.494 --> 43:58.454
I'll arrange for an escort
to take you out of the city.

43:58.538 --> 44:02.416
You cannot stay here after tonight.
You'll be taken to Dubno.

44:02.876 --> 44:05.211
There you will serve as maid in waiting

44:05.296 --> 44:09.382
until you have been trained
in the responsibilities of your birth.

44:22.897 --> 44:26.231
Alert the patrol
and apprehend my daughter as well.

45:25.167 --> 45:26.419
Natalia!

45:31.717 --> 45:33.175
Go back!

45:33.260 --> 45:35.511
Go back, Andrei ! Go back!

45:36.638 --> 45:38.598
Go back! Go back!

45:43.645 --> 45:44.937
Go back!

46:38.075 --> 46:39.493
Strangers.

46:53.466 --> 46:54.674
Strangers.

46:54.717 --> 46:56.760
Look at the way they ride.

47:25.916 --> 47:28.209
Turn around, son. Turn around.

47:31.421 --> 47:34.841
Don't move, son. Don't move.
Let's take a look at you.

47:35.467 --> 47:37.635
What is this, a skirt?

47:37.719 --> 47:39.554
My sons in skirts.

47:41.014 --> 47:43.808
Let's see if you can run to the well
without tripping over your dress.

47:43.892 --> 47:47.104
Papa, the only reason
I'd run to the well is to throw you in.

47:47.188 --> 47:49.105
How do you ride?

47:49.189 --> 47:50.273
Sidesaddle?

47:50.315 --> 47:52.817
Papa, please don't make fun of us.

47:53.944 --> 47:55.361
And why not?

47:56.446 --> 47:59.116
Because if you do, Papa, I'll hit you.

48:01.661 --> 48:03.412
You want to fight?

48:03.829 --> 48:05.788
Anytime you say, Papa.

48:05.831 --> 48:08.291
-Fists?
-What else?

48:10.044 --> 48:14.256
So you think you're tough enough
to push the old cock off the roost.

48:52.295 --> 48:54.087
Andrei, Taras.

48:59.136 --> 49:02.262
Look at them.
Two years they haven't seen each other.

49:02.347 --> 49:05.182
What do they do? Try to kill each other.

49:25.204 --> 49:27.914
Well, you've learned to fight a little.

49:28.374 --> 49:30.375
I'll say that for you.

49:31.042 --> 49:32.710
What about you?

49:43.264 --> 49:45.348
Andrei, you're hurt.

49:50.938 --> 49:52.230
Come.

49:52.272 --> 49:53.356
Sit.

49:57.570 --> 49:58.737
So,

49:59.197 --> 50:01.531
-who stuck you?
-A Pole.

50:05.035 --> 50:06.662
Did you kill him?

50:06.746 --> 50:08.747
My little brother did.

50:08.790 --> 50:10.791
What did you fight about?

50:11.251 --> 50:13.502
-A woman.
-A woman !

50:19.259 --> 50:21.218
How do you like that?

50:21.261 --> 50:25.723
Did you see the way he fought me?
With a sword hole in his shoulder.

50:33.273 --> 50:35.441
If we drink we will die

50:35.483 --> 50:37.651
And if we don't drink we will die

50:37.736 --> 50:42.032
So we might as well say what the hell
And let our glasses clink!

50:42.116 --> 50:45.325
Whatever your name
you'll be dying just the same

50:45.410 --> 50:48.579
So as long as we are going to die
It is better if we drink

50:48.621 --> 50:50.080
Whatever your name is...

50:50.123 --> 50:52.041
To Andrei and Ostap,

50:52.125 --> 50:54.044
sons of Taras.

50:54.128 --> 50:56.129
What's the Latin for vodka?

50:56.172 --> 50:59.882
-The Romans didn't drink vodka.
-That's why the Roman Empire fell.

50:59.966 --> 51:01.216
Scholars.

51:03.011 --> 51:06.139
Some men are lovers

51:06.223 --> 51:09.100
They work under covers

51:09.810 --> 51:16.565
And from lady's bed to lady's bed
they leap

51:17.777 --> 51:23.823
But I want to drink
to the man nobody drinks to

51:23.866 --> 51:27.951
The fellow who gets into bed

51:27.994 --> 51:33.083
and goes to sleep

51:34.168 --> 51:38.088
If we drink we will die

51:38.172 --> 51:40.674
And if we don't drink we will die

51:40.759 --> 51:44.636
So we might as well say what the hell
And let our glasses clink

51:45.721 --> 51:47.180
Go back.

51:47.264 --> 51:48.681
Make room.

51:52.687 --> 51:53.938
Andrei !

51:56.524 --> 51:57.774
Ostap!

52:00.027 --> 52:03.906
Take these horses
with your father's blessing.

52:04.616 --> 52:05.825
Kneel.

52:08.245 --> 52:10.787
I am the oldest living Cossack,

52:11.205 --> 52:14.541
but I refuse to die sitting on an oven.

52:15.919 --> 52:18.337
Now, you two start some fighting

52:18.839 --> 52:22.675
and give an old Cossack a chance
to die the way he should.

52:25.970 --> 52:29.056
Welcome to the Cossack Brotherhood.

52:29.099 --> 52:30.808
God ride with you.

52:36.731 --> 52:38.482
We're looking for Taras Bulba,

52:38.567 --> 52:41.068
Colonel of the Oumansky Cossacks.

52:41.111 --> 52:43.821
Filipenko! Korzh !

52:44.447 --> 52:46.699
You sons of the devil.

52:47.909 --> 52:50.077
-Shilo.
-Filipenko.

52:50.162 --> 52:54.248
What more can a man want?
My sons and my friends.

52:54.708 --> 52:58.335
My old partners
and my future partners in battle.

52:58.420 --> 53:01.338
So these are your young pups, eh?

53:01.423 --> 53:03.341
Not bad, not bad.

53:03.426 --> 53:05.886
Taras, you've done a good job, eh?

53:06.762 --> 53:11.599
Nice pair, but too small for me.
I'd have to carry this horse on my back.

53:11.683 --> 53:14.853
-I'd like to see that.
-With you on his back.

53:16.606 --> 53:18.064
Let's go.

53:20.943 --> 53:22.943
-Come on.
-Come on, Korzh.

53:22.986 --> 53:24.278
Come on.

53:34.957 --> 53:37.834
Who else can carry a horse
on their back all the night?

53:37.919 --> 53:40.712
Who else but an idiot would want to?

53:52.183 --> 53:53.642
The time is at hand

53:53.684 --> 53:56.144
when Cossacks will have
something better to do

53:56.187 --> 53:58.688
than carry horses around the house.

53:58.773 --> 54:01.484
Lift your scalp locks
out of the soup, Cossacks.

54:01.568 --> 54:03.694
Pull your sabers out of the bread.

54:03.779 --> 54:07.781
The hetman has raised
the golden standard of the archangel.

54:07.823 --> 54:10.909
The Zaporozhtzi are called to arms.

54:11.452 --> 54:13.871
We are marching to war!

54:18.794 --> 54:21.962
Women, more glasses. More vodka.

54:22.004 --> 54:24.632
May God ride with the Zaporozhtzi !

54:27.010 --> 54:29.345
Hey! When do we march?

54:29.388 --> 54:33.182
Every hairy-tongued Cossack
with powder in his flask

54:33.267 --> 54:35.016
will assemble at Chigirin

54:35.059 --> 54:38.938
on the road to Dubno
by the first day of Holy Easter Week.

54:40.607 --> 54:43.526
You can whet your blade,
Stepan Kanevsky,

54:43.568 --> 54:46.445
and prepare to die like a Cossack should.

54:48.491 --> 54:51.867
Who. . . Who. . . Who are we fighting?
Or doesn't it matter?

54:51.952 --> 54:53.744
Not a devil of a lot.

54:55.205 --> 54:57.748
Who is there to fight except the Poles?

54:57.874 --> 54:59.208
Right. The Poles.

54:59.294 --> 55:00.794
Not this time.

55:02.046 --> 55:03.547
The King of Poland

55:03.631 --> 55:07.633
wants an army of 10,000 Cossacks
under the Cossack standard,

55:07.718 --> 55:11.930
led by Cossack officers,
at full pay and booty,

55:12.015 --> 55:14.182
to march to the Baltic wars.

55:15.935 --> 55:17.644
And after the war?

55:19.563 --> 55:23.567
We bury our dead, clean our sabers,
count our booty, and get drunk.

55:23.651 --> 55:26.069
What the devil is he talking about?

55:26.112 --> 55:28.697
You don't argue with
an old pirate like Filipenko.

55:28.740 --> 55:29.948
This

55:30.283 --> 55:33.075
we will settle with our hetman, Mykola.

55:34.328 --> 55:38.498
Why must you always be so particular
about whose booty you take?

55:39.083 --> 55:42.586
Because the Cossacks fought
for the Poles once before,

55:42.628 --> 55:44.546
or have you forgotten?

55:49.594 --> 55:51.928
And do you remember, puppy?

55:51.971 --> 55:54.264
You weren't even littered yet.

55:54.766 --> 55:57.935
I'd rather be pulling the Turk's nose
if I had my choice.

55:58.020 --> 56:02.939
The plunder is richer
and I like the smell of harem girls.

56:03.024 --> 56:07.110
But they say these Baltic princes have
slop pots of gold, too,

56:07.195 --> 56:10.073
and their women have hips
like Percherons.

56:11.784 --> 56:15.620
And what's going to be left
of the Steppes when we get back?

56:16.205 --> 56:17.996
Questions! Questions!

56:18.414 --> 56:20.332
Is that what the Poles taught you?

56:20.416 --> 56:23.211
I'll tell you what the Poles taught me.

56:23.629 --> 56:28.466
That a Cossack is an ignorant barbarian
good enough to kiss a Pole's foot

56:28.550 --> 56:30.385
or fight a Pole's war,

56:31.010 --> 56:33.888
but not good enough
to walk Polish streets.

56:34.264 --> 56:36.974
Or raise his eyes to a Polish woman.

56:37.059 --> 56:39.102
Or rule his own land.

56:39.144 --> 56:42.438
A Cossack does not question
the word of a hetman.

56:42.481 --> 56:45.483
Will you fight or not?
That is the only question.

56:45.567 --> 56:47.235
Not for the Poles.

56:48.195 --> 56:52.448
Devil's blood, Taras, it looks like
you've raised a coward for a son.

57:07.214 --> 57:10.342
No man on earth can say
a Cossack is a coward.

57:13.179 --> 57:16.055
That can only be proven by the will of God.

57:17.766 --> 57:19.475
Tell him you didn't mean it.

57:19.518 --> 57:22.938
It's only a word. You can't die over a word.

57:23.022 --> 57:24.731
Taras, stop them.

57:25.525 --> 57:28.360
There are words men must die for.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.868
We will ride to the gorge at dawn.

57:51.593 --> 57:54.470
The starting mark will be of your choice.

58:28.838 --> 58:30.590
Take your positions.

58:41.310 --> 58:43.436
Let the will of God be done.

01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:07.105
-His shoulder, Papa.
-Return to your place, Cossack.

01:00:13.695 --> 01:00:15.446
Your arm, boy.

01:00:16.866 --> 01:00:19.034
Let the will of God be done.

01:01:29.523 --> 01:01:31.565
Burn this in your memory.

01:01:32.693 --> 01:01:35.944
The man who died was a great Cossack,

01:01:37.279 --> 01:01:39.281
and never forget it.

01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:54.588
Was I wrong?

01:01:56.466 --> 01:01:59.301
The hetman has called us to the standard.

01:01:59.344 --> 01:02:00.511
Now,

01:02:01.305 --> 01:02:05.641
tomorrow you raise your companies
and meet on the march to Chigirin.

01:02:06.893 --> 01:02:09.770
Tonight, ride to the village

01:02:10.897 --> 01:02:13.483
and drink Korzh's soul to hell.

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.353
Flaming flatbread, Cossacks.

01:03:19.091 --> 01:03:21.760
-Was I wrong?
-You were both wrong.

01:03:23.222 --> 01:03:24.889
And you were both right.

01:03:24.973 --> 01:03:28.684
Now, we ride to join Mykola
on the road to Dubno

01:03:28.727 --> 01:03:32.062
and I swear it will all be settled.

01:04:40.133 --> 01:04:41.717
Come on, Andrei.

01:06:46.386 --> 01:06:48.762
Tonight, we sleep under the stars.

01:06:54.269 --> 01:06:58.105
We'll be making our bed on the ground
for a long while to come.

01:07:13.455 --> 01:07:17.166
Women, take them and forget them.

01:07:18.502 --> 01:07:21.171
A Cossack can't let a woman worry him.

01:07:22.298 --> 01:07:24.214
Right, brother Andrei?

01:07:25.592 --> 01:07:27.342
Right, brother Ostap.

01:07:29.638 --> 01:07:31.598
Till you find your woman.

01:07:32.725 --> 01:07:34.392
Then you take her.

01:07:36.228 --> 01:07:38.062
You never forget her.

01:07:39.731 --> 01:07:40.982
You try.

01:07:45.446 --> 01:07:47.447
You fight, you get drunk.

01:07:48.324 --> 01:07:53.203
You tell yourself you're a Cossack.
You tell yourself that Papa's right.

01:08:00.211 --> 01:08:02.212
But you never forget her.

01:08:09.887 --> 01:08:11.679
You never forget her.

01:08:32.368 --> 01:08:36.453
All right, let's not waste time,
bless your sons.

01:08:41.670 --> 01:08:45.506
Bless you, my sons.
May God's Mother keep you.

01:08:45.549 --> 01:08:47.800
Send some little word if you can.

01:08:47.884 --> 01:08:52.846
May they always fight bravely,
and if not, perish. So, we go.

01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:02.876
Zaporozhtzi !

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.144
Zaporozhtzi !

01:10:21.479 --> 01:10:23.647
Zaporozhtzi !

01:10:39.665 --> 01:10:41.999
Zaporozhtzi !

01:11:14.534 --> 01:11:15.950
Zaporozhtzi !

01:11:16.243 --> 01:11:19.203
-Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !

01:11:55.908 --> 01:11:59.328
Zaporozhtzi !

01:12:11.091 --> 01:12:13.216
Zaporozhtzi !

01:12:26.648 --> 01:12:28.440
Zaporozhtzi !

01:12:30.109 --> 01:12:32.444
Zaporozhtzi !

01:13:55.697 --> 01:13:57.948
Zaporozhtzi !

01:13:59.075 --> 01:14:01.410
Zaporozhtzi !

01:14:20.723 --> 01:14:22.265
Welcome, Taras.

01:14:26.227 --> 01:14:30.063
-Greetings, Mykola.
-So, we ride together again,

01:14:30.106 --> 01:14:32.650
to meet Prince Grigory at Dubno.

01:14:32.735 --> 01:14:34.569
When I ride to Dubno,

01:14:36.697 --> 01:14:38.906
I'm riding to fight the Poles,

01:14:40.575 --> 01:14:42.911
and anyone who stands with them.

01:14:44.455 --> 01:14:47.665
Would you ride against the Zaporozhtzi,
Taras Bulba?

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:51.044
Let the Zaporozhtzi speak for themselves.

01:15:22.076 --> 01:15:24.744
Colonels, form your regiments.

01:15:41.513 --> 01:15:45.099
You heard the voice of the Zaporozhtzi,
Taras Bulba.

01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:48.310
Ride and you ride to your death.

01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:55.276
Let him hear your voice.

01:16:00.949 --> 01:16:05.120
You swore to wear a patch over one eye
until the Steppes were free.

01:16:05.829 --> 01:16:10.165
Cover both eyes, Tymoshevsky,
so you cannot see yourself.

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:14.962
Can we fight the whole Polish Empire?

01:16:15.422 --> 01:16:18.049
-Answer him with your guns.
-Filipenko?

01:16:19.843 --> 01:16:22.094
I'll have to shoot you, Taras.

01:16:23.513 --> 01:16:26.515
We are sworn by our holy faith,
Taras Bulba.

01:16:26.933 --> 01:16:29.060
Would you destroy that?

01:16:29.145 --> 01:16:32.981
There's only one way
to keep faith with a Pole.

01:16:34.232 --> 01:16:38.402
Put your faith in your sword,
and the sword in the Pole.

01:16:41.449 --> 01:16:43.742
Look to the heavens, Cossacks.

01:16:45.536 --> 01:16:47.787
The sun stands at the equinox.

01:16:49.164 --> 01:16:51.081
The Holy Easter dawns.

01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:55.378
Let the day of the Resurrection of our Lord

01:16:56.881 --> 01:17:00.675
be the day of the Resurrection of our land.

01:17:01.636 --> 01:17:05.722
The Poles have put a sword in our hands.

01:17:07.224 --> 01:17:08.892
Turn it on them.

01:17:30.415 --> 01:17:32.874
Surrender the standard, Mykola.

01:18:12.457 --> 01:18:14.668
Long life to the Zaporozhtzi !

01:18:15.586 --> 01:18:17.378
Death to the Poles!

01:18:52.290 --> 01:18:53.582
Cossacks.

01:18:54.834 --> 01:18:56.752
I signed this covenant,

01:18:57.462 --> 01:19:00.672
by the holy faith,
in the name of our brotherhood.

01:19:01.466 --> 01:19:04.634
While I live, you are bound by that oath.

01:19:05.678 --> 01:19:07.512
When you march,

01:19:07.597 --> 01:19:11.349
you have to march forward
over the flesh and bones

01:19:11.851 --> 01:19:13.643
of Ivan Mykola.

01:19:13.853 --> 01:19:15.729
Stand aside, Mykola.

01:20:36.271 --> 01:20:38.146
Long live Poland !

01:23:17.017 --> 01:23:19.102
I count only three regiments.

01:23:19.603 --> 01:23:21.270
Three regiments.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.857
To start.

01:23:39.456 --> 01:23:41.458
You taught us, Pole.

01:26:24.081 --> 01:26:26.959
Back, Zaporozhtzi, back from the wall !

01:26:28.961 --> 01:26:31.421
Back, sulfur and oil.

01:27:54.090 --> 01:27:55.340
So,

01:27:56.508 --> 01:27:58.092
you won't fight?

01:27:58.552 --> 01:28:00.178
Then starve.

01:28:01.139 --> 01:28:05.726
When you're eating cockroaches,
then you will come out.

01:28:06.811 --> 01:28:08.854
And we will be here.

01:28:09.814 --> 01:28:11.690
Do you hear me, Poles?

01:28:11.941 --> 01:28:14.067
We will be waiting.

01:28:16.654 --> 01:28:19.781
Are we going to fight
or weasel in the bushes, sucking eggs?

01:28:19.866 --> 01:28:23.244
Why the devil fall back?
Let's go after them and storm the walls.

01:28:23.287 --> 01:28:24.287
No.

01:28:25.246 --> 01:28:28.915
Here we are. And here we stay,

01:28:29.917 --> 01:28:34.255
until Dubno is a Cossack city.

01:30:02.846 --> 01:30:03.846
He's strong.

01:30:05.181 --> 01:30:07.223
He will live, God willing.

01:30:08.476 --> 01:30:11.228
First battle. You fought well.

01:30:12.689 --> 01:30:14.481
With your eyes open.

01:30:17.527 --> 01:30:19.319
He fought well, too.

01:30:19.738 --> 01:30:20.737
Too well.

01:31:01.405 --> 01:31:02.447
So. . .

01:31:03.532 --> 01:31:05.324
How is your strength?

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:10.246
I think you should find out
for yourself, Papa.

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:14.918
You're sure you're ready, Cossack?

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:19.422
Your stomach looks a little soft.

01:31:21.592 --> 01:31:22.759
Soft?

01:31:31.436 --> 01:31:33.686
Not as soft as I thought.

01:31:34.980 --> 01:31:37.190
You're right, Papa, too soft.

01:31:37.775 --> 01:31:39.108
Not ready.

01:31:43.782 --> 01:31:45.157
Big horse.

01:31:48.953 --> 01:31:52.288
A lake, a lake is as good as a well, Papa.

01:32:20.485 --> 01:32:21.485
So. . .

01:33:03.486 --> 01:33:04.696
Listen.

01:33:06.032 --> 01:33:07.574
The death bell.

01:33:08.451 --> 01:33:10.243
Do you hear that?

01:33:10.328 --> 01:33:11.870
The death bell.

01:33:12.872 --> 01:33:14.997
There's plague in the city.

01:33:16.876 --> 01:33:19.044
They're burning their dead.

01:34:09.012 --> 01:34:10.096
Hold your fire.

01:34:11.014 --> 01:34:13.014
Wait till they're closer.

01:34:16.269 --> 01:34:17.353
Fire.

01:35:48.572 --> 01:35:50.114
A Cossack.

01:35:50.532 --> 01:35:52.992
There's a Cossack in the city!

01:35:53.035 --> 01:35:54.826
There's a Cossack in the city.

01:35:54.869 --> 01:35:56.536
Raise the alarm !

01:35:56.579 --> 01:35:58.205
Alert the watch !

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:01.167
A Cossack in the city.

01:36:01.210 --> 01:36:03.002
Call out the guards.

01:36:10.218 --> 01:36:12.386
There's a Cossack in the city.

01:36:23.565 --> 01:36:25.483
A Cossack in the city!

01:37:59.246 --> 01:38:01.497
-Natalia.
-Andrei.

01:38:05.627 --> 01:38:08.630
-We'll get out of this city.
-Yes.

01:38:57.555 --> 01:38:58.639
Stop.

01:38:59.432 --> 01:39:00.724
The plague.

01:39:00.809 --> 01:39:03.393
This part of the city has been condemned.

01:39:03.435 --> 01:39:04.894
Let me go there. Please.

01:39:04.937 --> 01:39:08.607
They will open the east gate
to bury the dead outside of the city.

01:39:08.692 --> 01:39:09.692
No.

01:39:10.527 --> 01:39:11.527
No.

01:39:12.570 --> 01:39:14.405
Bring out the dead.

01:39:17.241 --> 01:39:19.410
Bring out the dead.

01:39:21.746 --> 01:39:23.747
Bring out the dead.

01:39:26.418 --> 01:39:28.252
Bring out the dead.

01:39:31.423 --> 01:39:33.757
Bring out the dead.

01:39:36.428 --> 01:39:38.220
Bring out the dead.

01:39:44.186 --> 01:39:45.936
Bring out the dead.

01:39:49.566 --> 01:39:51.567
Bring out the dead.

01:40:25.269 --> 01:40:27.562
-The Cossack!
-Take him.

01:40:27.646 --> 01:40:30.106
-A Polish woman !
-The Lady Natalia.

01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:31.775
Take them alive!

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:47.665
She had nothing to do with it. Let her go.

01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:49.542
-She helped you.
-Let her alone.

01:40:49.627 --> 01:40:52.505
Why did you come here?
To conquer Dubno single-handed?

01:40:52.547 --> 01:40:54.423
-Let her alone!
-Or to spy?

01:40:54.508 --> 01:40:56.008
Let her alone!

01:40:57.344 --> 01:41:02.180
Don't tell me the son of Taras Bulba came
into the city to rescue a Polish woman.

01:41:02.223 --> 01:41:03.723
Let her alone.

01:41:04.643 --> 01:41:06.143
Let her alone.

01:41:14.527 --> 01:41:15.736
Aliosha!

01:41:20.534 --> 01:41:24.328
You can't have that,
you'll jangle like an Arab dancing girl.

01:41:26.373 --> 01:41:28.207
What are you doing?

01:41:29.376 --> 01:41:31.544
We're wrapping the horses' hooves,

01:41:32.295 --> 01:41:34.713
padding the wheels with sheepskin,

01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:40.053
and we're tying the axles of the wagons
so the Poles won't hear us when we leave.

01:41:40.763 --> 01:41:41.887
Why?

01:41:45.392 --> 01:41:47.768
Listen to that iron bell, Taras.

01:41:47.853 --> 01:41:49.687
Look at the smoke.

01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:53.233
You can smell the stench
of the Black Death even here.

01:41:54.068 --> 01:41:56.069
Look at the sky, hetman.

01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:59.613
The dawn is rising over Mecca
this very moment.

01:41:59.948 --> 01:42:02.116
The Sultan is getting ready to sail.

01:42:02.702 --> 01:42:03.869
Dawn

01:42:04.704 --> 01:42:07.080
is rising over the Steppes, too.

01:42:08.833 --> 01:42:11.167
How many good men have died

01:42:12.002 --> 01:42:14.044
to keep the Steppes free,

01:42:14.881 --> 01:42:17.465
and the Cossack Brotherhood alive?

01:42:18.426 --> 01:42:22.095
But there is also
another kind of brotherhood.

01:42:24.015 --> 01:42:26.141
The brotherhood of wild beasts,

01:42:27.101 --> 01:42:29.394
who will desert their own kind.

01:42:32.023 --> 01:42:34.191
I will shovel manure, Taras,

01:42:34.775 --> 01:42:36.651
but I will not eat it.

01:42:37.612 --> 01:42:40.405
We followed you here to fight the Poles,

01:42:40.865 --> 01:42:44.743
not to wait like carrion crows
over a rotting carcass.

01:42:46.621 --> 01:42:51.292
I'm leaving by nightfall tonight
with any Cossack who will follow me.

01:42:52.544 --> 01:42:55.295
Will you turn traitor, Filipenko?

01:42:57.632 --> 01:43:00.800
Will you give the order
to shoot me down, Taras?

01:43:02.137 --> 01:43:06.515
-I will shoot you myself.
-Now you listen to me.

01:43:07.351 --> 01:43:10.644
You talk about wild animals, Taras,

01:43:11.479 --> 01:43:14.815
but if we fall killing each other

01:43:15.275 --> 01:43:17.485
right under the enemy's nose,

01:43:17.903 --> 01:43:20.655
that is like wild animals.

01:43:21.698 --> 01:43:24.282
Is that what brotherhood means?

01:43:28.789 --> 01:43:29.789
So. . .

01:43:32.042 --> 01:43:33.876
The old man is right.

01:43:35.837 --> 01:43:39.507
It is for each Cossack to search his soul

01:43:40.133 --> 01:43:42.426
and choose the way he will go.

01:43:58.735 --> 01:44:01.655
So, they're going.

01:44:03.366 --> 01:44:04.658
We stay.

01:44:06.494 --> 01:44:07.743
Someday,

01:44:08.704 --> 01:44:10.413
in years to come,

01:44:11.206 --> 01:44:13.250
when the Steppes are free,

01:44:14.127 --> 01:44:16.378
minstrels will sing of this.

01:44:17.547 --> 01:44:21.049
How a prince of the Poles surrendered

01:44:22.467 --> 01:44:25.304
to a meager three regiments of Cossacks.

01:44:26.306 --> 01:44:27.514
May God help us.

01:44:28.057 --> 01:44:29.391
May God help us.

01:44:32.312 --> 01:44:33.395
Where is he?

01:44:33.438 --> 01:44:36.940
You heard him during the fever.
It's that Polish woman.

01:44:37.608 --> 01:44:39.693
He must have gone into the city
to find her.

01:44:39.736 --> 01:44:42.404
-You're mad, boy.
-He loves her.

01:44:42.488 --> 01:44:45.115
She's been in his blood
since the first day at Kiev.

01:44:45.199 --> 01:44:46.951
No, not Andrei.

01:44:50.872 --> 01:44:52.247
In fever,

01:44:53.124 --> 01:44:54.916
men dream of women.

01:44:56.586 --> 01:44:59.756
But a Cossack could not love a Pole, no.

01:45:15.105 --> 01:45:16.564
Death to her!

01:45:17.191 --> 01:45:18.733
Death to her!

01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:24.113
Death to the Cossack harlot!

01:45:24.156 --> 01:45:26.407
Expose her shame!

01:45:26.617 --> 01:45:28.368
Let her be purged !

01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:31.913
Let her be purged in the fire of our wrath !

01:45:36.085 --> 01:45:39.128
-It is difficult to stop a hungry mob.
-I'll get food.

01:45:39.213 --> 01:45:40.797
That is easily said, Cossack.

01:45:40.839 --> 01:45:43.466
Give me a company of men.
I'll get you the oxen.

01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:45.928
Why should I trust the lives of Poles
to a Cossack?

01:45:45.970 --> 01:45:48.971
Because you're desperate.
And I know a way through the stockade.

01:45:49.056 --> 01:45:52.975
You ask me to accept your word?
The handclasp of a Cossack?

01:45:53.769 --> 01:45:56.437
I extended my hand to a Cossack once.

01:45:56.856 --> 01:45:59.525
It was a Cossack's saber,
but very much like this.

01:45:59.609 --> 01:46:01.318
Come here, Cossack.

01:46:01.361 --> 01:46:02.819
Come here.

01:46:03.404 --> 01:46:05.029
Reduce her to ashes!

01:46:05.114 --> 01:46:06.656
Burn the witch !

01:46:07.825 --> 01:46:09.952
Extend your arm, Cossack.

01:46:14.290 --> 01:46:16.792
We take our hands too much for granted.

01:46:16.835 --> 01:46:18.876
My first concern was for my sword arm,

01:46:18.961 --> 01:46:22.214
but I quickly learned to use a sword
with my left hand.

01:46:56.083 --> 01:46:57.709
Set the torch !

01:47:05.967 --> 01:47:08.052
She's your hostage. I'll get food.

01:47:08.095 --> 01:47:10.555
You ask me to believe
that the son of Taras Bulba

01:47:10.598 --> 01:47:13.558
would betray the Cossack Brotherhood,
his country, his father,

01:47:13.642 --> 01:47:15.601
for the sake of a woman?

01:47:15.685 --> 01:47:17.895
Could father and son be so unlike?

01:47:17.979 --> 01:47:19.189
Not so unlike.

01:47:19.231 --> 01:47:21.774
Both would be willing to die
for the thing they love.

01:47:21.859 --> 01:47:25.111
Give me 60 men to divert the Cossacks.
I'll stampede the oxen.

01:47:25.196 --> 01:47:27.947
Your reserves can drive them into the city.

01:47:30.408 --> 01:47:33.536
The power of love
is a constant source of amazement.

01:47:33.579 --> 01:47:36.581
If the military could control it,
we would conquer the world.

01:47:46.926 --> 01:47:47.926
Hear me!

01:47:48.928 --> 01:47:51.930
The Cossack will bring food to the city.

01:47:51.972 --> 01:47:53.473
Release the woman.

01:47:53.557 --> 01:47:54.600
No!

01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:58.895
-Burn the traitor.
-Oh, Andrei.

01:48:05.194 --> 01:48:06.487
Burn the witch !

01:48:17.749 --> 01:48:21.252
I love you, Andrei. I will always love you.

01:48:21.628 --> 01:48:23.963
You know that. I love you.

01:48:24.589 --> 01:48:27.550
But I can't let you fight
against your own people.

01:48:27.633 --> 01:48:29.885
I can't do it. Please don't.

01:48:31.012 --> 01:48:34.974
-I'm just getting food for the city.
-The Cossacks will fight.

01:48:35.684 --> 01:48:37.434
You're a Cossack, Andrei.

01:48:37.477 --> 01:48:39.853
I'm a man before I'm a Cossack.

01:48:39.938 --> 01:48:42.690
-I'm a Pole.
-You're a woman.

01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:46.360
Don't let them use me,
please, don't let them use me.

01:48:46.444 --> 01:48:48.654
You're the woman that I love.

01:48:48.738 --> 01:48:52.032
Don't let them use me
to turn you against your own kind.

01:48:52.117 --> 01:48:54.160
Natalia, you are my kind.

01:48:55.788 --> 01:48:57.496
You are my country.

01:48:59.541 --> 01:49:01.166
You are my love.

01:49:07.341 --> 01:49:08.508
Cossack!

01:49:10.845 --> 01:49:13.512
His Royal Highness is waiting for you.

01:49:33.951 --> 01:49:37.412
No, Andrei, no. Don't do it, please.

01:49:42.293 --> 01:49:45.837
Don't do it. No, please, it's not too late.

01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:47.672
Please, Andrei.

01:49:47.715 --> 01:49:49.257
Andrei, please.

01:49:53.347 --> 01:49:54.679
Andrei.

01:50:13.366 --> 01:50:18.245
There's sulfur and saltpeter in the air,
so strong I could almost taste it.

01:50:18.330 --> 01:50:20.956
They're filling their powder flasks.

01:50:21.041 --> 01:50:23.667
They're coming out, Shilo,
they're coming out.

01:50:23.751 --> 01:50:28.255
-And we've less than half an army.
-They're coming out, pass the word.

01:50:29.758 --> 01:50:32.218
They're coming out, pass the word.

01:51:25.982 --> 01:51:27.983
They're going for the oxen.

01:51:30.153 --> 01:51:32.362
-Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !

01:51:32.447 --> 01:51:34.281
Death to the Poles!

01:51:43.166 --> 01:51:44.666
Zaporozhtzi !

01:51:46.919 --> 01:51:49.881
Alert the cannoneer.
Prepare bombardment.

01:52:03.312 --> 01:52:04.604
Fire!

01:53:05.707 --> 01:53:09.210
Where's their strength?
Where's the Cossacks' strength?

01:53:09.253 --> 01:53:12.589
They're hard-pressed to give battle
to a handful of volunteers.

01:53:12.632 --> 01:53:15.509
We won't send out our forces
to round up the oxen.

01:53:15.593 --> 01:53:18.261
We'll slaughter the Cossack Brotherhood
once and for all.

01:53:18.345 --> 01:53:20.596
Call out the reserves,
we're going to attack.

01:53:35.488 --> 01:53:37.573
Damn his soul to hell.

01:53:39.868 --> 01:53:42.452
Traitor. After him.

01:53:42.537 --> 01:53:44.621
After him. After him.

01:54:37.134 --> 01:54:38.843
Get off your horse.

01:54:51.315 --> 01:54:53.483
Take off that Polish helmet.

01:54:59.406 --> 01:55:00.865
My son.

01:55:03.327 --> 01:55:04.369
Why?

01:55:07.874 --> 01:55:08.958
Why?

01:55:17.049 --> 01:55:18.883
I did what I had to do.

01:55:20.303 --> 01:55:25.182
From the day I plunged you
in the river to give you life,

01:55:27.811 --> 01:55:31.146
I loved you as I loved the Steppes.

01:55:34.025 --> 01:55:35.776
You were my pride.

01:55:40.657 --> 01:55:43.409
I gave you life.

01:55:46.413 --> 01:55:49.039
It is on me to take it away from you.

01:56:49.477 --> 01:56:51.728
The whole army is coming out!

01:57:02.239 --> 01:57:05.659
-They're attacking in full force.
-Sound the retreat.

01:57:05.744 --> 01:57:10.121
-Has your son made a coward of you?
-Sound the retreat!

01:58:24.197 --> 01:58:28.577
-Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !

01:58:28.619 --> 01:58:31.288
Ride, Filipenko!

01:58:32.415 --> 01:58:34.624
Filipenko!

01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:35.709
Ride!

01:58:36.668 --> 01:58:41.631
-Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !

02:01:54.453 --> 02:01:56.287
We will take him home.

02:01:57.749 --> 02:02:02.043
-To be buried on Cossack soil.
-This is Cossack soil now.

02:02:04.171 --> 02:02:06.297
Let Andrei be buried here.

02:02:06.882 --> 02:02:08.132
In peace.

02:02:28.737 --> 02:02:31.739
Now Dubno is a Cossack city.

02:02:34.035 --> 02:02:37.246
We will not ravage or plunder.

02:02:37.997 --> 02:02:40.249
There will be no more killing.

02:02:41.835 --> 02:02:44.168
We will take this city in peace,

02:02:45.338 --> 02:02:47.131
burn out the plague,

02:02:47.841 --> 02:02:49.716
open the supply wagons.

02:02:50.135 --> 02:02:52.845
We will feed all the people

02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:55.389
of our city.
