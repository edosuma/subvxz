01:19.419 --> 01:22.553
<i>There was Sasha, a journalism major</i>

01:22.555 --> 01:24.389
<i>with intelligence to shine</i>

01:24.391 --> 01:27.158
<i>on the country's most

01:27.160 --> 01:31.163
<i>Then she ended up doing a, um,
different kind of journalism.</i>

01:31.165 --> 01:34.666
<i>It may not be Pulitzer
Prize-winning,</i>

01:34.668 --> 01:37.068
- <i>but she's making it happen.</i>
- (goofy yell)

01:37.070 --> 01:39.338
She's gonna be fine. I don't
even know why... You know.

01:39.340 --> 01:41.006
We've gone through this before.
I already know, you know?

01:41.008 --> 01:43.178
- RYAN: Here she comes.
- <i>There was Dina.</i>

01:44.410 --> 01:45.711
<i>She was a risk-taker.</i>

01:45.713 --> 01:46.944
It's chlamydia, y'all!

01:46.946 --> 01:48.580
That's shit you can cure! Hey!

01:48.582 --> 01:50.782
- RYAN: <i>But that's our girl.</i>
- I knew it!

01:50.784 --> 01:52.717
<i>Of course, there's Lisa.</i>

01:52.719 --> 01:54.919
<i>Despite being the sexy party girl,</i>

01:54.921 --> 01:57.756
<i>she was a natural nurturer.</i>

01:57.758 --> 02:02.030
<i>She gave love, even
when it didn't love her.</i>

02:05.398 --> 02:07.866
(sniffles)

02:07.868 --> 02:11.770
- (whimpers) - Aw, come here, baby. Aw.
- Aw, baby.

02:11.772 --> 02:13.137
<i>Me? I'm Ryan Pierce,</i>

02:13.139 --> 02:15.307
- <i>successful author...</i>
- I like your dress.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.642
You write best-selling
books. You cook on talk shows.

02:17.644 --> 02:20.145
- You make appearances all across the country.
- (chuckles)

02:20.147 --> 02:21.445
How do you have time for a life?

02:21.447 --> 02:23.714
As women, we're told that we have to choose

02:23.716 --> 02:25.583
between the personal and the professional,

02:25.585 --> 02:27.952
<i>but I control my own destiny.</i>

02:27.954 --> 02:29.454
<i>I am strong,</i>

02:29.456 --> 02:31.823
I am powerful, I am beautiful.

02:31.825 --> 02:33.825
<i>If I will it,</i>

02:33.827 --> 02:34.992
I can have it all.

02:34.994 --> 02:36.761
<i>Married my college sweetheart.</i>

02:36.763 --> 02:38.129
So, I'm a huge fan, Stewart.

02:38.131 --> 02:40.298
- Thank you.
- But I do have a question for you.

02:40.300 --> 02:43.267
How does a former All-Pro
tight end like yourself,

02:43.269 --> 02:44.603
how do you hook up with
the second coming of Oprah?

02:44.605 --> 02:47.439
Ryan's strength has always been

02:47.441 --> 02:49.808
making others their best selves.

02:49.810 --> 02:53.111
And I knew I needed that in my life.

02:53.113 --> 02:54.612
<i>I married my best friend.</i>

02:54.614 --> 02:56.314
- Yeah, you got him, girl!
- (laughing)

02:56.316 --> 02:58.749
RYAN: <i>And the Flossy Posse
was there to witness.</i>

02:58.751 --> 03:00.351
<i>We were ride or die.</i>

03:00.353 --> 03:03.622
<i>But sometimes words go unsaid,</i>

03:03.624 --> 03:06.357
<i>disagreements go unresolved.</i>

03:06.359 --> 03:09.260
<i>You still talk on the phone,
keep up on social media, but...</i>

03:09.262 --> 03:11.997
<i>a year goes by where you
don't see each other,</i>

03:11.999 --> 03:13.831
<i>and that year turns to five,</i>

03:13.833 --> 03:15.433
<i>and before you know it,</i>

03:15.435 --> 03:17.669
<i>you're so busy trying
to get what you want,</i>

03:17.671 --> 03:19.771
<i>that one day you
look up and find out</i>

03:19.773 --> 03:22.773
<i>that the thing you love
the most, your crew,</i>

03:22.775 --> 03:26.344
<i>the people who make you feel at
home no matter where you are,</i>

03:26.346 --> 03:29.780
<i>they're gone.</i>

03:29.782 --> 03:32.119
(women laughing happily)

03:34.387 --> 03:36.654
- I know!
- ELIZABETH: Yeah, I heard you.

03:36.656 --> 03:37.889
Well, no, I've got to go. I got...

03:37.891 --> 03:38.890
Well, I have to ask the question

03:38.892 --> 03:40.659
to get the answer. Okay. Bye.

03:40.661 --> 03:42.194
Hey, sweetheart. Ryan.

03:42.196 --> 03:44.362
Ryan, hey. Earth to Ryan.

03:44.364 --> 03:47.832
Honey, listen, I know
that you are exhausted.

03:47.834 --> 03:50.335
I got you running all over this
planet doing this book, but...

03:50.337 --> 03:54.306
the Essence folks just called, and...

03:54.308 --> 03:56.207
(singsongy): and...

03:56.209 --> 03:58.809
they want you to be the
keynote speaker this year.

03:58.811 --> 04:02.546
Yeah. It's VIP, five-star
treatment all the way.

04:02.548 --> 04:05.316
You just sign some books,
sign some autographs,

04:05.318 --> 04:07.218
shake hands, you have heaps of praise...

04:07.220 --> 04:08.820
RYAN: <i>And that's when you realize</i>

04:08.822 --> 04:12.758
<i>that the Flossy Posse
needs to ride again.</i>

04:12.760 --> 04:15.760

but I can't make people click on your ads.

04:51.932 --> 04:53.364

05:01.707 --> 05:04.041
Ryan Pierce. Any dirt on her?

05:04.043 --> 05:05.609
Absolutely not.

05:05.611 --> 05:07.779
Plus, I can't invent scandal.

05:07.781 --> 05:09.880
But I guarantee you, nine months from now,

few more days to increase views.

05:18.125 --> 05:19.724
Please.

05:19.726 --> 05:22.126

05:22.128 --> 05:24.395

05:24.397 --> 05:26.630
Hold, please.

05:26.632 --> 05:29.633
Yeah, motherfucker! Eat a
bowl of dicks, motherfucker!

05:29.635 --> 05:31.135
You know you need me!

05:31.137 --> 05:33.137
I'm the bitch in these streets!

05:33.139 --> 05:34.906
- You put me on FaceTime.
- (exhales)

05:34.908 --> 05:36.741
Oh, my God.

05:40.481 --> 05:42.746
Oh, no, no, no, no!

05:42.748 --> 05:44.017
That's my car!

05:48.788 --> 05:51.789
Dina, it has come to my
attention that you had

05:51.791 --> 05:53.991
a bit of a conflict with a fellow employee.

05:53.993 --> 05:56.094
No, not really.

05:56.096 --> 05:57.128
I didn't know it was your lunch!

05:57.130 --> 05:58.964
- Did you not see the label?!
- No!

05:58.966 --> 06:00.464
(overlapping shouting)

06:00.466 --> 06:02.967
- Stupid motherfucker!
- Dina...

06:02.969 --> 06:05.472
- (shouting) Don't you run from me!
- (screaming)

06:07.039 --> 06:09.039
The point is, physically
assaulting a coworker

06:09.041 --> 06:10.774
because he accidentally stole your lunch

06:10.776 --> 06:13.844
- from the fri...
- Accidentally? Is that what he told you?

06:13.846 --> 06:15.680
He knew that was my Go-Gurt.

06:15.682 --> 06:18.116
That motherfucker is crazy for that shit.

06:18.118 --> 06:20.952
Be that as it may, this
is not the first time

06:20.954 --> 06:23.020
something like this has happened.

06:23.022 --> 06:24.991
I'm gonna need to terminate you.

06:26.392 --> 06:28.460
I'm letting you go.

06:28.462 --> 06:29.727
Word?

06:29.729 --> 06:31.061
Word.

06:31.063 --> 06:32.897
- Ah.
- Yeah.

06:32.899 --> 06:34.633
Good looking out, Ted.

06:34.635 --> 06:36.334
Thanks for letting me go, man.

06:36.336 --> 06:38.370
Appreciate that. Just nothing
but water under the bridge.

06:38.372 --> 06:39.738
I'm-a go and get back to work.

06:39.740 --> 06:41.472
No, no. There's no water and no bridge.

06:41.474 --> 06:42.375
You're fired.

06:44.211 --> 06:45.844
Why you making me feel like
I'm on <i>The Apprentice</i>

06:45.846 --> 06:46.977
or something?

06:46.979 --> 06:49.748
Look, I get it. You're upset.

06:49.750 --> 06:52.817
I shouldn't be throwing
things in a "place of work."

06:52.819 --> 06:54.419
Why are you making air quotes?

06:54.421 --> 06:55.921
This is a place of work.

06:55.923 --> 06:57.421
Lesson learned.

06:57.423 --> 06:59.924
Wow, you're so understanding. Oh, oh, oh.

06:59.926 --> 07:01.859
By the way, I'm going to Essence Fest

07:01.861 --> 07:03.495
this weekend with my girls.

07:03.497 --> 07:04.529
We about to turn up.

07:04.531 --> 07:06.330
So I'm-a need Friday off.

07:06.332 --> 07:09.334
Okay. Uh, you can have all days off, Dina,

07:09.336 --> 07:11.503
because you no longer work here.

07:11.505 --> 07:13.406
Do you understand what I'm saying?

07:15.041 --> 07:17.875
Totally. See you bright
and early Tuesday morning,

07:17.877 --> 07:18.943
- plus or minus a few hours,
- All right.

07:18.945 --> 07:20.210
- depending on traffic.
- We're not...

07:20.212 --> 07:22.380
Dina. Dina, we're not done yet.

07:22.382 --> 07:23.782
- Yes, we are.
- Dina!

07:23.784 --> 07:25.784
Okay, Ted! (chuckles)

07:25.786 --> 07:27.452
(whispers): Snitches get stitches.

07:27.454 --> 07:28.887
Oh, shit.

07:28.889 --> 07:32.022
- Dina, you need to grow up!
- Mm-hmm.

07:32.024 --> 07:34.125
LISA: <i>Bath time, homework
time, snack time.</i>

07:34.127 --> 07:37.561
Seaweed chips, cucumber
rounds without the skin.

07:37.563 --> 07:40.130
Bedtime 8:00 p.m. sharp.

07:40.132 --> 07:41.198
(chuckling)

07:41.200 --> 07:42.933
Ma.

07:42.935 --> 07:45.436
I need you to focus.

07:45.438 --> 07:46.938
Would you calm down?

07:46.940 --> 07:49.474
I have raised kids before.

07:49.476 --> 07:51.943
And some of 'em turned out okay.

07:51.945 --> 07:53.645
You know what, forget
it. I'm just gonna stay.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.647
I'm gonna stay! Because I can't have

07:55.649 --> 07:57.582
these kids deviate from
their schedule in any way.

07:57.584 --> 07:58.717
It just messes everything up.

07:58.719 --> 08:01.385
- So forget it.
- What up, bitch?

08:01.387 --> 08:03.955
(chuckles) Oh, what's good, Miss Miller?

08:03.957 --> 08:05.789
Hello, Dina.

08:05.791 --> 08:07.424
Have you heard of a doorbell?

08:07.426 --> 08:09.327
Uh, have you heard of locking doors?

08:09.329 --> 08:10.962
There's crazy people out there.

08:10.964 --> 08:12.563
- (chuckles)
- Mm.

08:12.565 --> 08:14.265
- You ready to get turnt?
- No, I'm not going,

08:14.267 --> 08:15.933
- because I-I don't want to leave the kids alone!
- No!

08:15.935 --> 08:17.335
- It's not gonna work!
- No, no.

08:17.337 --> 08:19.003
- Uh-uh. No.
- For once, I agree with Dina

08:19.005 --> 08:20.638
and her foul mouth.

08:20.640 --> 08:23.774
She needs this trip so she
can go off and get some love

08:23.776 --> 08:25.577
so she can stop being
so grouchy all the time.

08:25.579 --> 08:28.313
- Ma!
- Your mama know there's cobwebs on that thing.

08:28.315 --> 08:30.481
- Uh...
- You know what...

08:30.483 --> 08:31.649
- (giggling)
- DINA: Sorry.

08:31.651 --> 08:34.251
Oh. Mm.

08:34.253 --> 08:36.419
- Bye, Mama.
- Oh, my goodness.

08:36.422 --> 08:39.756
- I'm gonna miss you. Oh, I'm gonna miss you so much.
- Mama.

08:39.759 --> 08:41.760
Heifer, you are not going off to war.

08:41.761 --> 08:43.760
Go. Go. I beg of you, go.

08:43.763 --> 08:45.263
We'll be fine.

08:45.265 --> 08:47.265
(chuckling): You are so silly.

08:47.267 --> 08:48.667
Scrubs?

08:48.669 --> 08:50.669
Really? That's what you're doing?

08:50.671 --> 08:51.936
What's wrong with this?

08:51.938 --> 08:53.337
Uh-uh. We are not going nowhere

08:53.339 --> 08:55.606
until we see you with some camel toe, okay?

08:55.608 --> 08:57.274
No, I don't do camel toe.

08:57.276 --> 08:58.709
Okay, well, you can't just show forearm.

08:58.711 --> 09:00.145
- That's not sexy.
- All right, Dina...

09:00.147 --> 09:02.112
Where are you going, to teach first grade?

09:02.114 --> 09:03.515
- Okay...
- Who wears socks this thick in New Orleans?

09:03.517 --> 09:05.015
- All right. I organized everything!
- Nobody.

09:05.017 --> 09:06.451
Girl, we're going to the
Essence... What is this,

09:06.453 --> 09:08.119
- the "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" Collection?
- Okay, I...

09:08.121 --> 09:09.453
- Is this a Care Bear shirt?
- Don't touch nothing!

09:09.455 --> 09:10.789
Don't touch nothing!

09:10.791 --> 09:12.390
(bell rings)

09:12.392 --> 09:14.893
- As usual, you guys fucking killed it.
- (chuckles)

09:14.895 --> 09:19.233
And, and I'm not the
only one who thought so.

09:21.167 --> 09:23.668
Are you gonna tell us who else thought so?

09:23.670 --> 09:27.337
(sighs) You have no patience
for dramatic revelation!

09:27.339 --> 09:29.207
Fine.

09:29.209 --> 09:31.543
Bethany Marshall, the head
of marketing from Best Mart,

09:31.545 --> 09:35.045
thought so, and...

09:35.047 --> 09:37.582
- And what else?
- (groans, chuckles)

09:37.584 --> 09:40.351
She wants to launch an exclusive Ryan

09:40.353 --> 09:42.352
and Stewart collection

09:42.354 --> 09:45.656
and underwrite a Ryan
and Stewart talk show.

09:45.658 --> 09:46.658
Boom!

09:46.660 --> 09:47.991
Wait, are you serious?

09:47.993 --> 09:49.260
Yes, I'm serious!

09:49.262 --> 09:50.995
That's... amazing!

09:50.997 --> 09:53.497
I know. She said... and I quote...

09:53.499 --> 09:55.667
"they're both just so real."

09:55.669 --> 09:57.268
She's gonna send her
business affair peeps down

09:57.270 --> 09:58.870
to New Orleans this
weekend to make the offer.

09:58.872 --> 10:01.271
They want to launch by end of year.

10:01.273 --> 10:03.274
- (chuckles) - That's amazing.
- (chuckling)

10:03.276 --> 10:06.111
- Thank you.
- Honey, thank you.

10:06.113 --> 10:08.612
We're gonna be rich, we're
gonna be rich! And thank you.

10:08.614 --> 10:11.048
- (chuckles)
- (chuckles) Hey, baby, I got to head out

10:11.050 --> 10:12.350
or I'm gonna miss my flight.

10:12.352 --> 10:13.751
- Oh.
- But I will see you

10:13.753 --> 10:16.087
and the Flossy Posse in New Orleans.

10:16.089 --> 10:17.956
- Yes. Mwah.
- All right.

10:17.958 --> 10:19.890
- I love you.
- I love you.

10:19.892 --> 10:22.126
- In love with you.
- I'm in love with you.

10:22.128 --> 10:24.629
I love you. (laughs) Come here!

10:24.631 --> 10:27.698
- Oh! (chuckling)
- Mm. Thanks.

10:27.700 --> 10:28.799
- (whoops)
- (chuckles)

10:28.801 --> 10:30.135
Mm.

10:30.137 --> 10:31.202
(sighs)

10:31.204 --> 10:32.403
(Elizabeth moans)

10:32.405 --> 10:33.607
I am so lonely.

10:34.741 --> 10:35.774
Oh!

10:35.776 --> 10:37.141
- Mm.
- Oh, you smell...

10:37.143 --> 10:39.110
- you smell good.
- Yeah, she...

10:39.112 --> 10:41.246
- she bought it for me.
- Sorry. Go before I spank you!

10:41.248 --> 10:42.246
I just did!

10:42.248 --> 10:43.448
(chuckles)

10:43.450 --> 10:45.283
- Please go. Bye!
- (chuckles) Mwah!

10:45.285 --> 10:48.086
Oh, gosh, that man
knows how to exit a room.

10:48.088 --> 10:49.087
- (chuckles)
- Mm.

10:49.089 --> 10:50.789
(barks)

10:50.791 --> 10:52.957
Now, Ryan, honey, don't be mad,

10:52.959 --> 10:55.058
but with so much on the line, are you sure

10:55.060 --> 10:57.996
that you want to get turned
with your girls this weekend?

10:57.998 --> 10:59.597
I promised them a free trip.

10:59.599 --> 11:00.999
And it's "turnt" with a "T."

11:01.001 --> 11:03.000
Okay, got it, got it.

11:03.002 --> 11:05.236
But maybe just wait until the deal closes,

11:05.238 --> 11:06.571
and then, you know, take
'em all to St. Barts,

11:06.573 --> 11:08.472
buy 'em all Birkin bags, something.

11:08.474 --> 11:10.308
Liz, it'll be fine. I promise.

11:10.310 --> 11:11.742
Listen, we're all adults,

11:11.744 --> 11:13.745
and our insane party days are behind us.

11:13.747 --> 11:15.446
- Well, most of us.
- Mm. I don't know.

11:15.448 --> 11:16.948
I just know if I was with
my college girlfriends...

11:16.950 --> 11:18.649
(chuckles) in New Orleans,

11:18.651 --> 11:20.284
there would be pictures of
our tits all over the Internet.

11:20.286 --> 11:22.319
I mean, there's actually
a few of those out there.

11:22.321 --> 11:24.322
I don't know if you saw 'em.
But, anyway, it doesn't matter,

11:24.324 --> 11:26.524
'cause, the point is,
I have civilian titties,

11:26.526 --> 11:27.792
but you have best-selling author titties.

11:27.794 --> 11:29.459
And-and ten percent of
your titties are my titties.

11:29.461 --> 11:32.029
I just... I just want our
titties to have a future.

11:32.031 --> 11:34.198
- Liz.
- Yeah.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.034
What's the name of my book?

11:36.036 --> 11:38.369
<i>You Can Have It All.</i>

11:38.371 --> 11:40.471
Exactly.

11:40.473 --> 11:43.207
Okay, okay, you're right. I'm
gonna defer to your judgment.

11:43.209 --> 11:44.808
So, listen, I'm gonna, um, fly in

11:44.810 --> 11:46.376
before your first appearance.

11:46.378 --> 11:48.645
I'm really excited to
meet the Flossy Posse.

11:48.647 --> 11:51.886
You girls are gonna be
kiki-ing all weekend.

11:53.987 --> 11:55.986
- Okay, Liz.
- Yeah.

11:55.988 --> 11:58.289
- And I say this out of love...
- Preach, girl.

11:58.291 --> 12:02.059
Mm. Please refrain from
saying things like "preach"

12:02.061 --> 12:03.461
or "go, girl,"

12:03.463 --> 12:05.295
"bye, Felicia," "ratchet,"

12:05.297 --> 12:07.698
or any other colloquialisms
that you may have heard

12:07.700 --> 12:09.399
or looked up on Urban Dictionary.

12:09.401 --> 12:11.236
This weekend,

12:11.238 --> 12:14.072
over half a million black
women of all sizes, shades,

12:14.074 --> 12:16.374
from all different
socioeconomic backgrounds

12:16.376 --> 12:18.809
are descending on the
Crescent City to celebrate

12:18.811 --> 12:22.145
black womanhood in all its glorious forms.

12:22.147 --> 12:25.151
You, my dear friend, are a guest.

12:26.552 --> 12:28.886
Act accordingly.

12:28.888 --> 12:30.654
(exhales)

12:30.656 --> 12:31.890
Wow.

12:31.892 --> 12:33.524
I'm not even offended.

12:33.526 --> 12:35.360
- You're the best.
- Oh! Mm.

12:35.362 --> 12:37.061
- (giggles)
- Okay.

12:37.063 --> 12:39.496
(sighs)

12:39.498 --> 12:44.168
Have fun on your #BlackGirlMagic weekend.

12:44.170 --> 12:45.272
Girl, bye.

12:48.174 --> 12:51.509
- (humming)
- 4718 to New Orleans will commence boarding shortly.

12:51.511 --> 12:54.712
Ooh! Got my hand sanitizer.

12:54.714 --> 12:56.780
Got my anti-nausea medication.

12:56.782 --> 12:58.415
Hold on to that. Ooh!

12:58.417 --> 13:00.183
Hi, earplugs.

13:00.185 --> 13:03.087
Uh, you need to relax, Judge Judy.

13:03.089 --> 13:05.023
You know, I got some bomb-ass Kush,

13:05.025 --> 13:07.424
if you want to take a hit of
it before you get on the plane.

13:07.426 --> 13:08.592
That shit will have you right.

13:08.594 --> 13:10.260
Where did you hide...

13:10.262 --> 13:12.529
You know what? Never mind.

13:12.531 --> 13:14.064
I'm not even gonna ask.

13:14.066 --> 13:16.402
Fine, I ain't gonna tell you.

13:17.970 --> 13:19.971
Okay, I'm-a tell you.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.972
Where the sun don't shine.

13:21.974 --> 13:26.744
You know, a lot of people
think that means the vagina,

13:26.746 --> 13:30.948
but actually it's the butthole.

13:30.950 --> 13:35.285
(quietly): I got drugs in my booty.

13:35.287 --> 13:38.588
You know what, that can
cause a lot of infection.

13:38.590 --> 13:41.592
Girl, you can't get no
infection in your booty hole.

13:41.594 --> 13:43.160
It's a booty hole.

13:43.162 --> 13:44.428
Okay.

13:44.430 --> 13:45.663
Enough.

13:45.665 --> 13:47.097
You're grown.

13:47.099 --> 13:50.101
On another note, let me ask you a question.

13:50.103 --> 13:53.303
Do you think this situation
with Ryan and Sasha,

13:53.305 --> 13:56.307
think there's still drama
or has it been long enough?

13:56.309 --> 13:58.643
It better be, 'cause I plan
on getting white girl-wasted

13:58.645 --> 14:00.645
this weekend, and I ain't
letting none of you bitches

14:00.647 --> 14:02.947
kill my vibe, okay?

14:02.949 --> 14:05.283
(coughing)

14:05.285 --> 14:07.018
That's hand sanitizer.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.952
It burns. (coughing)

14:08.954 --> 14:10.420
Well, considering we don't
know where your mouth has been,

14:10.422 --> 14:11.655
it can't hurt.

14:11.657 --> 14:13.491
- Oh, my God.
- You want a cough drop?

14:13.493 --> 14:15.693
- Mm. Yeah. (coughing)
- Here. Just...

14:15.695 --> 14:17.794
Excuse me. Uh, can you ladies point me

14:17.796 --> 14:22.433
- in the direction of the Flossy Posse?
- (gasps) Oh, my God!

14:22.435 --> 14:24.268
Oh, my goodness!

14:24.270 --> 14:26.103
- It's so good to see you.
- Oh, wow. - You look great.

14:26.105 --> 14:28.172
I'm so happy to see you two.

14:28.174 --> 14:29.874
- Girl, you're killing it!
- Yeah.

14:29.876 --> 14:31.208
- Turn-up time.
- (laughing)

14:31.210 --> 14:32.709
Hey, ladies!

14:32.711 --> 14:34.846
- Hey, Sasha!
- (squealing)

14:34.848 --> 14:38.382
- Oh, I've missed you guys so much!
- (laughing)

14:38.384 --> 14:39.384
So good to see you!

14:39.386 --> 14:41.619
Flossy Posse, Flossy Posse,

14:41.621 --> 14:43.621
- Flossy Posse, Flossy Posse.
- Yeah, I know you are.

14:43.623 --> 14:45.523
- Hey!
- Hey! - Hey!

14:45.525 --> 14:46.857
DINA: She baddie!

14:46.859 --> 14:49.162
(giggling)

14:50.796 --> 14:52.797
Sash! (chuckles)

14:52.799 --> 14:54.631
Hey, Ry.

14:54.633 --> 14:56.500
Hey.

14:56.502 --> 14:58.669
Well, life is treating
you well. I see that.

14:58.671 --> 15:01.672
Please. I see you and Stew
pop up on my feed once a week

15:01.674 --> 15:04.842
going to some fabulous event.

15:04.844 --> 15:06.843
- I love your hair.
- Nice dr...

15:06.845 --> 15:08.880
(both laugh)

15:08.882 --> 15:10.981
It seems like they're getting along.

15:10.983 --> 15:12.983
- Shit. (chuckles)
- Right?

15:12.985 --> 15:15.086
These bitches is plastic.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.087
- That's a great lipstick, too.
- Thank you, right?

15:17.089 --> 15:18.890
Ladies!

15:18.892 --> 15:21.762
- I made something very special for us this weekend.
- Oh.

15:23.897 --> 15:25.199
Bam!

15:26.532 --> 15:27.999
DINA: What the fuck?

15:28.001 --> 15:30.400
Look like a Bedazzler
threw up on that thing.

15:30.402 --> 15:32.403
What? This is very fashionable.

15:32.405 --> 15:34.871
It's of today and
yesterday. It's very retro.

15:34.873 --> 15:37.842
How about we save it for the last night?

15:37.844 --> 15:39.847
- Of our lives?
- (laughing)

15:41.547 --> 15:45.015
Or donate it to the My
Little Pony Motorcycle Club.

15:45.017 --> 15:49.553
Okay. I put a lot of
man-hours into these jackets.

15:49.555 --> 15:51.521
Now, see, that's not the
kind of man-hours we need you

15:51.523 --> 15:52.756
- putting in, Lisa-Lis.
- Mm...

15:52.758 --> 15:54.792
Okay. Et tu, Sasha?

15:54.794 --> 15:56.626
DINA: Yes, you need to
be bedazzling some dick.

15:56.628 --> 15:58.929
- That's what you need to do.
- (laughing)

15:58.931 --> 16:00.630
LISA: Enough.

16:00.632 --> 16:02.433
DINA: Okay, now, here's what I want.

16:02.435 --> 16:04.702
Let me get three shots of
whiskey with a Coke to chase.

16:04.704 --> 16:07.237
Coke Zero, though. I'm watching my figure.

16:07.239 --> 16:10.808
Dina, you know this is only an hour flight.

16:10.810 --> 16:12.776
Oh. Well, then, in that case,
let me go ahead and get those

16:12.778 --> 16:15.313
three shots now and then
bring me a shot of Baileys

16:15.315 --> 16:17.314
- once we get into cruising altitude.
- Oh, she...

16:17.316 --> 16:19.483
- she about to turn up.
- Sure.

16:19.485 --> 16:22.086
Oh, and let me get a Cherry Coke.

16:22.088 --> 16:23.553
- Dina.
- Huh?

16:23.555 --> 16:25.255
Can we just bring it down a notch?

16:25.257 --> 16:28.226
Oh, can we get some dick this weekend?

16:28.228 --> 16:29.427
- Leave her alone.
- You know what?

16:29.429 --> 16:30.794
I need you to use your lady mouth.

16:30.796 --> 16:33.563
I need you to use your lady mouth.

16:33.565 --> 16:35.665
RYAN: All right, all right.

16:35.667 --> 16:38.269
Let's just use Lisa's
version of lady mouth.

16:38.271 --> 16:40.505
No, seriously, for real, though...

16:40.507 --> 16:43.607
how long has it been since
you got that back blown out?

16:43.609 --> 16:46.443
I don't know. Two years, maybe.

16:46.445 --> 16:48.111
- What?
- Wait.

16:48.113 --> 16:49.779
Si-Since Terrence?

16:49.781 --> 16:51.582
I don't know.

16:51.584 --> 16:53.417
I mean, I take a vigorous spin class,

16:53.419 --> 16:55.785
I read really intense erotica,

16:55.787 --> 16:57.355
and I invested in a very powerful

16:57.357 --> 16:58.789
detachable showerhead,

16:58.791 --> 17:00.691
which has been very good to me, mind you.

17:00.693 --> 17:02.125
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

17:02.127 --> 17:04.127
Okay, that story just
put me into menopause.

17:04.130 --> 17:05.428
You getting some this weekend.

17:05.430 --> 17:06.596
DINA: Straight up.

17:06.598 --> 17:08.632
You gonna get at least
two dicks inside of you.

17:08.634 --> 17:10.101
For crying out loud, Dina,

17:10.103 --> 17:11.768
we only gonna be there for three days.

17:11.770 --> 17:13.303
Well, three dicks, then.

17:13.305 --> 17:15.038
- (laughs)
- Mm-hmm.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.108
You know, Lisa, Dina could be right.

17:17.109 --> 17:19.109
Daily penetration is medicinal.

17:19.112 --> 17:20.511
Oh, my goodness.

17:20.512 --> 17:22.313
Don't be ashamed, girl.

17:22.315 --> 17:24.047
Every sister up in here

17:24.049 --> 17:27.017
is on a mission to be her very best

17:27.019 --> 17:28.386
- and ratchet self.
- Oh...

17:28.387 --> 17:29.986
You, especially.

17:29.988 --> 17:32.323
Who's ready for Essence Fest?

17:32.325 --> 17:34.191
(all cheering)

17:34.193 --> 17:35.659
Yes!

17:35.661 --> 17:37.861
See, Lisa? There is no turning down

17:37.863 --> 17:40.063
up in here, only the turn-up.

17:40.065 --> 17:41.498
(laughs) I love turn-ups.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.066
- Ma'am, excuse me.
- Oh, oh.

17:43.068 --> 17:44.802
Excuse me, uh, I got this.

17:44.804 --> 17:45.969
Can you go ahead and
make some Patrón shots

17:45.971 --> 17:46.970
for everybody up here?

17:46.972 --> 17:48.406
On me.

17:48.408 --> 17:50.507

a super size Slurpee

filled with grain alcohol before noon.

20:32.071 --> 20:34.170
little human beings ripped out of my vagina

20:41.180 --> 20:42.545
Will you take a picture with us?

LISA: You know, I'm so proud of her.

20:49.654 --> 20:50.920
Look at her.

20:50.922 --> 20:52.890
It's like traveling with Beyoncé.

20:52.892 --> 20:54.257
Oh, my God.

20:54.259 --> 20:55.926
Are you guys friends with Ryan?

20:55.928 --> 20:57.394
- Yeah.
- Yeah. - Yeah.

20:57.396 --> 20:58.896
I'm a huge fan!

20:58.898 --> 21:00.230
Here. This is for you.

21:00.232 --> 21:02.265
- Here. Here. Yes.
- Oh, okay, thank you.

21:02.267 --> 21:03.667
- Okay.
- That's so wonderful.

21:03.669 --> 21:04.834
- Enjoy.
- Yes!

21:04.836 --> 21:07.938
This is like traveling with Beyoncé!

21:07.940 --> 21:10.908
- Thank you so much. Aw.
- Girl, you so pretty.

21:10.910 --> 21:13.177
Mm-mm, mm-mm. Hey,
hey, sister, sister,

21:13.179 --> 21:15.612
- it's $50 a pop. $50 a pop. - $50?
- Hey,

21:15.614 --> 21:16.880
- uh, Dina? - Okay?
- (phone dings)

21:16.882 --> 21:18.082
- I wouldn't do that.
- Who else trying

21:18.084 --> 21:20.050
to take a picture with Ryan? It's $50.

21:20.052 --> 21:22.386
We take American Express, EBT...

21:22.388 --> 21:23.687
- You trying to go to jail?
- You want to get a picture?

21:23.689 --> 21:25.589
- 'Cause you need a permit for all that.
- Girl...

21:25.591 --> 21:27.024
- I ain't going to nobody's jail, okay?
- What the fuck?

21:27.026 --> 21:30.261
- We good? All right, sister.
- Lisa. Lisa.

21:30.263 --> 21:31.896
LISA: Wait a minute, hold up.

21:31.898 --> 21:33.863
- SASHA: Can you believe this?
- LISA: Oh, my God.

21:33.865 --> 21:36.802
What y'all trippin' off of?

21:38.371 --> 21:40.905
Aw, hell no.

21:40.907 --> 21:42.273
That can't really be...

21:42.275 --> 21:43.908
That's definitely Stewart's punk ass,

21:43.910 --> 21:46.110
and that's definitely not
Ryan he's tonguing down.

21:46.112 --> 21:47.878
Where'd you get the picture?

21:47.880 --> 21:49.580
My paparazzi guy sent it to me.

21:49.582 --> 21:51.549
Who is this ratchet-ass bitch?

21:51.551 --> 21:53.817
SASHA: <i>Simone. Some Instagram ho.</i>

21:53.819 --> 21:55.953
- (Simone moaning) - <i>I
heard she sucked off A-Rod</i>

21:55.955 --> 21:57.655
<i>- in the bathroom one time.</i>
- DINA: <i>Wait a minute,</i>

21:57.657 --> 21:59.156
all this NBA dick, and she's

21:59.158 --> 22:00.890
sucking a baseball player?

22:00.892 --> 22:02.293
You know what I'm saying?
That type of bitch.

22:02.295 --> 22:04.227
Oh, my God. I hate her, but you know what,

22:04.229 --> 22:06.130
that ass is really cute.

22:06.132 --> 22:08.399
Do you get that from squats
or is that injections?

22:08.401 --> 22:10.301
Oh, shit... she here.

22:10.303 --> 22:12.902
That little dirty bitch Simone is here?

22:12.904 --> 22:14.438
Okay, we got to tell Ryan.

22:14.440 --> 22:15.672
So I had to go inwards and do

22:15.674 --> 22:17.107
- to be able to do that.
- Oh, of course.

22:17.109 --> 22:18.409
Handle that, Sasha.

22:18.411 --> 22:20.177
Why I got to be the one?

22:20.179 --> 22:22.079
- It's your picture, ho.
- Okay,

22:22.081 --> 22:24.148
no matter what, we have
to do it delicately,

22:24.150 --> 22:25.850
- because she's having a good time.
- You're welcome.

22:25.852 --> 22:28.151
No, no, fuck that. You got to
do it like a Brazilian wax...

22:28.153 --> 22:29.753
just yank everything out at once.

22:29.755 --> 22:31.655
Now, she gonna feel like
her uterus is on the paper,

22:31.657 --> 22:33.290
and she gonna scream,

22:33.292 --> 22:35.426
but it's way better than
waterboarding the bitch.

22:35.428 --> 22:37.594
Can we at least wait till
we get back to the room?

22:37.596 --> 22:39.263
Can we agree on that?

22:39.265 --> 22:41.130
(sighs)

22:41.132 --> 22:43.801
So, we have the most amazing suite

22:43.803 --> 22:45.436
at the Monteleone,

22:45.438 --> 22:48.005
VIP passes to all the parties,

22:48.007 --> 22:51.307
and great seats at the
Superdome for New Edition,

22:51.309 --> 22:54.143
Maxwell, and Doug E. Fresh!

22:54.145 --> 22:55.813
And we are going to eat!

22:55.815 --> 22:57.313
Damn the calories.

22:57.315 --> 22:58.615
- Yup!
- Oh, yes, yes!

22:58.617 --> 23:00.284
I'm gonna kill somebody.

23:00.286 --> 23:01.518
What?

23:01.520 --> 23:03.387
- (chuckles, mumbles)
- (chuckles)

23:03.389 --> 23:05.723
Now, I do have some obligations,

23:05.725 --> 23:09.226
but the truth is this weekend
is all about the Flossy Posse.

23:09.228 --> 23:10.727
We're gonna be staying up late,

23:10.729 --> 23:12.830
drinking, making memories that we can

23:12.832 --> 23:14.564
laugh about the rest of our lives,

23:14.566 --> 23:17.200
- because that is what a girls trip is for.
- Yeah, word.

23:17.202 --> 23:19.637
- LISA: YOLO.
- Ooh, I got to hide a bitch body.

23:19.639 --> 23:21.304
And gossip.

23:21.306 --> 23:24.341
No secrets. I want all the dirt.

23:24.343 --> 23:26.880
Bitch, your man is sleeping
with a Instagram skank.

23:29.715 --> 23:32.149
You just had to say something, didn't you?

23:32.151 --> 23:34.351
That was an opening.

23:34.353 --> 23:36.256
That's God. Recognize.

23:38.524 --> 23:40.224
Come on, Ryan. I need to...

23:40.226 --> 23:42.191
- I got to show you something.
- (growls)

23:42.193 --> 23:44.263
Mmm.

23:49.401 --> 23:51.837
Ryan, I don't... I don't
really know what to say.

23:54.073 --> 23:57.344
You know we're here for
you for whatever you need.

23:59.344 --> 24:00.678
Don't worry, boo.

24:00.680 --> 24:02.345
I'm-a put hands on him.

24:02.347 --> 24:04.281
I'm talking hot grits,

24:04.283 --> 24:06.917
extension cords, Timberland boots.

24:06.919 --> 24:09.285
I'm-a fuck up that
bitch's Instagram account,

24:09.287 --> 24:11.854
I'm-a put two Q-tips
in his pee-pee hole

24:11.856 --> 24:13.524
and I'm-a walk 'em
around. I'm-a just wipe...

24:13.526 --> 24:15.592
I'm-a just swipe in that thing

24:15.594 --> 24:16.927
and I'm-a yank 'em out!

24:16.929 --> 24:18.528
And then I'm-a stick

24:18.530 --> 24:20.030
my fingers up in his ass

24:20.032 --> 24:21.564
and tell him I'm checking his prostate,

24:21.566 --> 24:22.967
but really I'm-a yank his balls

24:22.969 --> 24:24.435
out the back of that motherfucker.

24:24.437 --> 24:25.636
And then I'm-a put my fist

24:25.638 --> 24:26.736
so far up his ass,

24:26.738 --> 24:28.138
I'm-a pull his heart out

24:28.140 --> 24:29.607
through that motherfucker and I'm-a

24:29.609 --> 24:31.274
"nabi da shakti de" that shit.

24:31.276 --> 24:34.277
Just... (imitates heartbeat)

24:34.279 --> 24:36.913
And then I'm-a stick my
fingers back up in his ass

24:36.915 --> 24:38.415
and then I'm-a twirl 'em around

24:38.417 --> 24:40.383
and see if that make
him giggle a little bit.

24:40.385 --> 24:42.319
You know, 'cause I like to
make a motherfucker laugh

24:42.321 --> 24:44.391
when I hurt him, you know what I'm saying?

24:45.825 --> 24:48.492
Well, that's not necessary, Dina.

24:48.494 --> 24:50.127
Really, honestly,

24:50.129 --> 24:53.496
I've known about this
for a few months, so...

24:53.498 --> 24:56.300
The fuck? You into that shit?

24:56.302 --> 24:58.168
No. Dina, come on.

24:58.170 --> 25:00.771
Obviously I was very upset, but...

25:00.773 --> 25:02.171
Stewart and I are in counseling,

25:02.173 --> 25:03.940
and we're working through it.

25:03.942 --> 25:06.843
Well, look at tha... That is fantastic.

25:06.845 --> 25:10.080
I am so glad to hear that. Good for you.

25:10.082 --> 25:11.415
Thank you, Lis. You know,

25:11.417 --> 25:12.649
Stewart and I are a team, you know?

25:12.651 --> 25:13.851
Yeah, he's made some mistakes,

25:13.853 --> 25:15.119
but that's in the past.

25:15.121 --> 25:18.589
No, it's not.

25:18.591 --> 25:20.493
This picture was taken last night.

25:22.193 --> 25:24.194
Mmm...

25:24.196 --> 25:26.663
Well, I don't believe that, Sasha.

25:26.665 --> 25:28.131
And you know what... I really...

25:28.133 --> 25:29.667
I don't want to be judged right now.

25:29.669 --> 25:31.869
I'm the last person to judge you, but...

25:31.871 --> 25:33.970
Guys. Okay, listen.

25:33.972 --> 25:35.872
I really meant what I said earlier.

25:35.874 --> 25:38.441
This weekend is about us.

25:38.443 --> 25:39.877
We haven't hung in five years,

25:39.879 --> 25:43.179
and by the grace of God,
we are here, together.

25:43.181 --> 25:44.782
Come on, let's take advantage of that.

25:44.784 --> 25:46.216
'Cause if we don't... if we waste

25:46.218 --> 25:48.151
this precious time... then shame on us.

25:48.153 --> 25:50.187
Because today is the last day

25:50.189 --> 25:51.988
that we will ever be this young.

25:51.990 --> 25:54.224
She fucked me up with that one.

25:54.226 --> 25:56.459
All right. Now, the Flossy Posse

25:56.461 --> 25:58.728
is back in New Orleans, so let's go.

25:58.730 --> 26:00.130
Let's go. Let's go, bitches.

26:00.132 --> 26:01.698
LISA: She's right, let's go.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.700
DINA: But I will shit in that nigga's shoe.

26:03.702 --> 26:05.034
Ryan.

26:05.036 --> 26:06.736
You know it's just a matter of time

26:06.738 --> 26:08.072
before the photographer

26:08.074 --> 26:10.043
shops this picture.

26:11.074 --> 26:13.145
Sash, don't worry. I'm-a handle it.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.913
Come on, y'all!

26:16.915 --> 26:19.149
(indistinct conversations)

26:19.151 --> 26:22.052
I love this place so much.

26:22.054 --> 26:24.588
Wow. So, listen, I'm gonna go check us in,

26:24.590 --> 26:26.189
get our credentials. You guys should go

26:26.191 --> 26:28.324
check out the Carousel
Bar and have a drink,

26:28.326 --> 26:30.093
and I'll be back in, like, five minutes.

26:30.095 --> 26:32.095
It's really cute.

26:32.097 --> 26:33.596
- All right.
- To the bar.

26:33.598 --> 26:35.064
- I'm ready to rock.
- Looks nice.

26:35.066 --> 26:37.333
Let's see.

26:37.335 --> 26:38.502
LISA: Oh, look at that!

26:38.504 --> 26:40.269
Yeah, your kids would like this.

26:40.271 --> 26:42.939
Man, damn. This is the shit, man.

26:42.941 --> 26:46.409
Oh, it's so cool. It's moving around.

26:46.411 --> 26:48.911
Yeah, it's super cute.

26:48.913 --> 26:51.614
Ooh! There goes Stewart.

26:51.616 --> 26:54.618
Oh. Asshole.

26:54.620 --> 26:56.053
- Dina, look at me.
- Don't.

26:56.055 --> 26:58.522
Look at me. Okay, come on, now.

26:58.524 --> 27:00.256
You heard what Ryan
said. Just-just be cool.

27:00.258 --> 27:01.758
I'm gonna be cool, I'm gonna be cool.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.459
I just want to say hi, that's all.

27:03.461 --> 27:05.228
- Why you taking... - Wait...
- I'm-a just say hello.

27:05.230 --> 27:07.531
- No. No, no, don't you say hello.
- No, no, don't...

27:07.533 --> 27:08.799
No, Dina, don't do that. Remember,

27:08.801 --> 27:10.234
- Ryan said this is her life.
- Yes.

27:10.236 --> 27:11.235
- We shouldn't get involved.
- Hold this.

27:11.237 --> 27:13.070
♪ ♪

27:13.072 --> 27:15.072
- (distorted): Dina!
- Dina, no!

27:15.074 --> 27:16.476
No!

27:20.912 --> 27:22.379
- (exclaims)
- (screams)

27:22.381 --> 27:24.380
- Oh!
- Bitch!

27:24.382 --> 27:25.448
What the hell's wrong with you?

27:25.450 --> 27:27.316
Don't play me, nigga. I will end you.

27:27.318 --> 27:30.656
You and your little
thirsty-ass wannabe MILF...

27:31.723 --> 27:33.055
...but not really a MILF.

27:33.057 --> 27:34.557
Nigga, you getting old bitches

27:34.559 --> 27:36.059
from the resting home?

27:36.061 --> 27:37.828
Is that what you're doing to my homegirl?

27:37.830 --> 27:40.797
You fuckin' with Gladys Knight, nigga?

27:40.799 --> 27:43.566
Do you got kneepads under
them slacks, Slurpee?

27:43.568 --> 27:46.472
- What?
- Dina, this is my Aunt Marion.

27:48.140 --> 27:49.739
How do you do?

27:49.741 --> 27:52.141
Oh, I'm doing just fine, but you know what?

27:52.143 --> 27:54.076
Your nephew is nasty.

27:54.078 --> 27:55.746
He a nasty nigga.

27:55.748 --> 27:57.313
Oh, yeah, your bloodline is nasty.

27:57.315 --> 27:59.082
Okay, all right, okay,
all right. I'm sorry.

27:59.084 --> 28:00.684
- She-she off her meds today.
- He do people wrong.

28:00.686 --> 28:02.351
- Forgive her.
- You're going to hell!

28:02.353 --> 28:03.920
You so nasty!

28:03.922 --> 28:07.256
In that ugly, tight-ass suit!

28:07.258 --> 28:09.826
- It's ugly!
- It is so very nice to meet you, Miss Auntie.

28:09.828 --> 28:11.794
- (chuckles nervously)
- And that is a lovely blouse

28:11.796 --> 28:13.429
- you have on.
- Why, thank you.

28:13.431 --> 28:17.167
And as for you, Stewart...

28:17.169 --> 28:19.937
I am very disappointed in you... very.

28:19.939 --> 28:22.038
You guys have a lovely afternoon.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.540
Thank you for your time.

28:23.542 --> 28:25.609
Thank you. You have a good day, too.

28:25.611 --> 28:29.446
(Dina continues shouting, growling)

28:29.448 --> 28:30.880
- What the hell happened?
- SASHA: Breathe, just breathe.

28:30.882 --> 28:32.783
- Just calm down.
- I was gone for three minutes.

28:32.785 --> 28:35.052
- This shit took one.
- What? Th-The...

28:35.054 --> 28:36.519
Hockey players don't even fight that fast.

28:36.521 --> 28:37.720
Ma'am, I need you to leave

28:37.722 --> 28:38.721
- the premises immediately.
- Oh!

28:38.723 --> 28:40.457
Hello, sir.

28:40.459 --> 28:43.293
Uh, Ryan Pierce, this year's
Essence keynote speaker,

28:43.295 --> 28:44.828
and author of <i>You Can Have It All.</i>

28:44.830 --> 28:46.129
I am sorry.

28:46.131 --> 28:47.698
I'd like to apologize for my friends,

28:47.700 --> 28:49.699
but I can assure you that
everything is fine now.

28:49.701 --> 28:52.369
Ma'am, she's holding a broken
bottle of Château Mardaux.

28:52.371 --> 28:54.571
Oh, don't be speaking
French to me, motherfucker!

28:54.573 --> 28:56.073
- (all clamoring)
- Dina,

28:56.075 --> 28:57.207
you're lucky my aunt is hard of hearing.

28:57.209 --> 28:58.307
And you lucky TSA took that

28:58.309 --> 28:59.743
straight edge away from me.

28:59.745 --> 29:01.210
- Okay, okay, okay, all right.
- Mr. Pierce,

29:01.212 --> 29:03.045
we're in the process of
removing her right now.

29:03.047 --> 29:04.547
- Thank you. - Dina.
- Oh, wai-wai-wai-wai-wait.

29:04.549 --> 29:06.816
- Wait. Really, that is not necessary.
- Dina, calm down.

29:06.818 --> 29:10.219
I promise you. We are longtime
friends, since college.

29:10.221 --> 29:12.054
I mean, this is just the
way we greet each other.

29:12.056 --> 29:14.424
Ms. Pierce, I'm sorry,

29:14.426 --> 29:17.361
but that's not the way we do things here.

29:17.363 --> 29:19.428
Okay. Understood.

29:19.430 --> 29:21.700
But we are not pressing charges, okay?

29:22.934 --> 29:25.334
Isn't that right, Stew?

29:25.336 --> 29:27.336
Well... no.

29:27.338 --> 29:28.938
But if that's the hotel's policy,

29:28.940 --> 29:30.540
- then I understand.
- No!

29:30.542 --> 29:32.508
- What? You know what, you're ridiculous.
- Eat a dick.

29:32.510 --> 29:34.511
- I mean that as a sister to a brother.
- You know what?

29:34.513 --> 29:36.178
- You need to stop.
- You know what, it's cool. I'm-a leave.

29:36.180 --> 29:37.747
- Okay, we're leaving. We're gonna leave.
- I'm-a leave.

29:37.749 --> 29:39.216
- Just give me a second.
- It's all gonna be good.

29:39.218 --> 29:40.950
Oh! Dina! Oh, my...

29:40.952 --> 29:42.953
Okay, you know what, Dina, get over here.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.287
DINA: Milk Dud head mother...

29:44.289 --> 29:46.422
You look like a ugly, dirty Mr. Clean!

29:46.424 --> 29:47.690
Your girl needs a leash.

29:47.692 --> 29:49.626
DINA: Swipe-ass bastard!

29:49.628 --> 29:51.428
Your room. Now.

29:51.430 --> 29:53.397
I don't want to go to my room.

29:53.399 --> 29:55.064
That place is nasty.

29:55.066 --> 29:56.399
It's haunted.

29:56.401 --> 29:58.368
I was there last year... swear to God,

29:58.370 --> 29:59.636
was up in there last year...

29:59.638 --> 30:01.438
a ghost tried to fuck me.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.306
You ever been fucked by a ghost?

30:03.308 --> 30:05.108
RYAN: Are you kidding me?

30:05.110 --> 30:07.476
You said you ended this shit
and now there's a picture?

30:07.478 --> 30:09.446
Are you not understanding?

30:09.448 --> 30:11.380
And on top of it, the bitch is here.

30:11.382 --> 30:12.983
I didn't invite her.

30:12.985 --> 30:14.484
Well, neither the fuck did I.

30:14.486 --> 30:16.652
You need to call her and you need to send

30:16.654 --> 30:19.389
that genetically enhanced ass home!

30:19.391 --> 30:21.490
Come on, babe. How am
I supposed to do that?

30:21.492 --> 30:23.659
The same way you tell
her to come get some dick.

30:23.661 --> 30:25.294
You tweet, Snapchat, DM,

30:25.296 --> 30:27.563
smoke signals... whatever you do,

30:27.565 --> 30:28.934
I don't give a shit.

30:32.438 --> 30:34.905
You know what? (scoffs) Whatever.

30:34.907 --> 30:36.573
I'm not doing this.

30:36.575 --> 30:39.008
This is stupid.

30:39.010 --> 30:40.509
This isn't a marriage,

30:40.511 --> 30:43.612
but we agreed to at least be a partnership,

30:43.614 --> 30:45.681
and you can't hold up
your end of the bargain,

30:45.683 --> 30:47.016
let alone your pants.

30:47.018 --> 30:49.419
This is against everything

30:49.421 --> 30:51.487
I tell my readers, my followers,

30:51.489 --> 30:52.989
and yet I'm putting up with it?

30:52.991 --> 30:54.457
- No.
- Ry, Ry...

30:54.459 --> 30:56.126
I'm sorry.

30:56.128 --> 30:58.261
- You're always sorry.
- I-I know, but look at...

30:58.263 --> 30:59.830
I won't do it again.

30:59.832 --> 31:01.998
You always ain't gonna do it again.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.265
Baby, I mean it this time.

31:03.267 --> 31:05.034
- (sighs)
- Okay?

31:05.036 --> 31:06.769
Real talk.

31:06.771 --> 31:08.505
Ryan, baby, listen.

31:08.507 --> 31:10.006
You're right.

31:10.008 --> 31:12.309
You don't deserve this.

31:12.311 --> 31:15.544
But our brand is who we are.

31:15.546 --> 31:18.648
It's... it's who you are.

31:18.650 --> 31:20.950
Giving all that up because I was sloppy

31:20.952 --> 31:22.351
isn't worth all that you have worked

31:22.353 --> 31:24.487
very hard to accomplish.

31:24.489 --> 31:27.457
Why would we give it up?

31:27.459 --> 31:29.458
And for what?

31:29.460 --> 31:31.328
Huh?

31:31.330 --> 31:32.728
To watch it all crumble?

31:32.730 --> 31:36.166
To be alone?

31:36.168 --> 31:38.668
Ryan, baby, I'm not going anywhere.

31:38.670 --> 31:40.236
You know that.

31:40.238 --> 31:42.240
I don't give a damn about her.

31:44.575 --> 31:47.076
Let's just do our dance

31:47.078 --> 31:49.678
and handle our business.

31:49.680 --> 31:53.085
Be that couple who has it all.

31:56.354 --> 31:58.854
No more slipups.

31:58.856 --> 32:00.756
Stick to the plan

32:00.758 --> 32:02.993
and get that ho under control.

32:02.995 --> 32:04.428
And we close this deal.

32:04.430 --> 32:05.896
Done.

32:05.898 --> 32:09.168
Some of us have to find a place to stay.

32:12.237 --> 32:13.703
(door opens)

32:13.705 --> 32:15.772
- Damn.
- (door closes)

32:15.774 --> 32:17.407
You okay?

32:17.409 --> 32:18.874
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

32:18.876 --> 32:20.576
So where we at?

32:20.578 --> 32:24.214
I called... all the four or
five-star hotels are booked.

32:24.216 --> 32:27.417
You know what? Whatever.
Who needs a fancy suite?

32:27.419 --> 32:29.252
I mean, come on.

32:29.254 --> 32:31.623
Let's rough it. It'll be like old times.

32:37.462 --> 32:38.961
I get the feeling there's definitely been

32:38.963 --> 32:41.531
a few chalk outlines on this floor.

32:41.533 --> 32:42.899
Oh, yeah, somebody

32:42.901 --> 32:45.101
was definitely murdered in this room.

32:45.103 --> 32:48.438
This smells like the body is still in here.

32:48.440 --> 32:49.776
Ugh.

32:51.977 --> 32:55.245
The fuck? No mini-bar?

32:55.247 --> 32:57.413
I feel like that one
star was hella generous.

32:57.415 --> 32:58.915
Bitch, you the reason we here.

32:58.917 --> 33:01.951
Classic Dina. You just
had to cause a scene.

33:01.953 --> 33:04.653
Classic Sasha. Can't never let shit go.

33:04.655 --> 33:06.555
- It just happened. Why would I let it go?
- What do you mean

33:06.557 --> 33:08.291
- it just happened? It's in the past.
- Come on. - We told you...

33:08.293 --> 33:09.825
- Please, that was in the past.
- Hey... - In the past?!

33:09.827 --> 33:11.428
- Yes, it's in the past.
- This is your fault. - Hey, hey,

33:11.430 --> 33:12.963
- stop arguing!
- (knocking)

33:12.965 --> 33:14.797
- Stop it...
- LISA: Don't argue!

33:14.799 --> 33:17.434
- Don't argue. - DINA: Let it go!
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

33:17.436 --> 33:19.169
- I think I got scabies.
- DINA: What?

33:19.171 --> 33:21.170
- I'm itchy.
- Y'all expecting somebody?

33:21.172 --> 33:22.642
- (knocking
continuing) - Uh-uh.

33:25.344 --> 33:27.279
Fucking foggy peephole.

33:28.479 --> 33:29.748
(deep voice): Who is it?!

33:35.953 --> 33:37.086
- Oh, oh!
- Rochelle here?

33:37.088 --> 33:38.088
Oh!

33:38.090 --> 33:39.523
Uh, no, sir, I am sorry,

33:39.525 --> 33:40.857
you have the wrong room.

33:40.859 --> 33:42.359
- Please leave.
- This is where

33:42.361 --> 33:43.994
I meet Rochelle every night.

33:43.996 --> 33:45.461
Hey, Rochelle ain't here, homeboy.

33:45.463 --> 33:46.630
You need to get on.

33:46.632 --> 33:48.364
It don't have to be Rochelle.

33:48.366 --> 33:50.467
I'll take one of you.

33:50.469 --> 33:52.802
You mean to tell me we staying at a motel

33:52.804 --> 33:54.970
where five-dollar hos do they business?

33:54.972 --> 33:58.007
Five dollars? Shit, I
get two dollars change.

33:58.009 --> 33:59.476
Ooh!

33:59.478 --> 34:01.277
Lisa, you game?

34:01.279 --> 34:04.281
Might as well turn a profit
on dick number one tonight.

34:04.283 --> 34:05.448
Bust that thing open.

34:05.450 --> 34:06.716
- (laughs)
- Not if she wearing that.

34:06.718 --> 34:09.051
- What?
- I told you that outfit was

34:09.053 --> 34:11.154
ugly as hell. He don't even want to fuck.

34:11.156 --> 34:13.156
Listen, sir, just because
she is not fashionable

34:13.158 --> 34:15.058
doesn't mean that you have to be rude.

34:15.060 --> 34:16.393
- (kisses)
- Aah!

34:16.395 --> 34:18.127
- Aah! - Oh! Oh!
- Get out of here!

34:18.129 --> 34:19.328
- Aah!
- Get out of here!

34:19.330 --> 34:20.830
Get out!

34:20.831 --> 34:22.565
- SASHA: Shoot.
- What's wrong with him?

34:22.567 --> 34:24.033
Close this.

34:24.034 --> 34:25.301
- You don't want some of this?
- Aah!

34:25.303 --> 34:26.335
(all screaming)

34:26.337 --> 34:27.737
Aah! What is that?

34:27.739 --> 34:29.071
You don't want some of this?

34:29.072 --> 34:31.641
- (screaming)
- (laughing)

34:31.643 --> 34:33.676
- Aah!
- MAN: Oh, oh!

34:33.678 --> 34:36.245
- Shit.
- (screaming continuing)

34:36.246 --> 34:37.580
You are disgusting!

34:37.581 --> 34:39.516
(laughs)

34:39.518 --> 34:42.384
Go find Rochelle! No, you go find Rochelle.

34:42.386 --> 34:44.754
- (Dina laughing)
- Y'all are gonna give me a...

34:44.755 --> 34:45.821
heart attack.

34:45.822 --> 34:47.424
(laughing)

34:47.426 --> 34:50.759
RYAN: Okay. Okay.

34:50.761 --> 34:52.995
I don't find this funny at all.

34:52.996 --> 34:54.730
(Ryan, Sasha and Dina laugh)

34:54.732 --> 34:57.199
(laughter, dog barking)

34:57.201 --> 34:58.601
(music plays quietly)

34:58.603 --> 35:00.569
Yes, girl, you're giving me life!

35:00.571 --> 35:02.071
Oh, hold up, Sash.

35:02.073 --> 35:04.440
Your tag is hanging
out. Let me pull it out.

35:04.442 --> 35:06.042
Oh, no, no, no, don't pull it.

35:06.044 --> 35:07.509
Um, just tuck it in for me.

35:07.511 --> 35:08.877
All right. Okay.

35:08.879 --> 35:10.413
I made a deal with the designer.

35:10.415 --> 35:12.515
I'm gonna, you know,
Instagram it this weekend.

35:12.517 --> 35:14.216
Some tastemaker shit.

35:14.218 --> 35:16.219
Lis, hurry up!

35:16.221 --> 35:19.188
Okay, P. Diddy is not gonna
be waiting for me all night.

35:19.190 --> 35:20.957
He's a busy man.

35:20.959 --> 35:23.225
All right, I'm almost ready.

35:23.227 --> 35:25.094
("Mexican Hat Dance" playing)

35:25.096 --> 35:27.033
What the fuck is that?

35:28.567 --> 35:30.266
(laughing)

35:30.268 --> 35:32.636
Wait a minute. Hold on. You...

35:32.638 --> 35:35.272
You got to be kidding me!

35:35.274 --> 35:36.705
I really like this outfit.

35:36.707 --> 35:39.808
I mean, this is hand-stitched embroidery

35:39.810 --> 35:41.111
from an indigenous tribe

35:41.113 --> 35:43.312
in Guatemala that's almost extinct.

35:43.314 --> 35:45.748
So they not fucking in Guatemala?

35:45.750 --> 35:47.650
- Mm.
- You know what?

35:47.652 --> 35:50.085
Intelligent men of academia

35:50.087 --> 35:52.788
- are gonna really appreciate this outfit.
- Huh.

35:52.790 --> 35:55.225
All right, listen, you look beautiful.

35:55.227 --> 35:57.997
- Thank you.
- Now take it off and put this on.

35:59.330 --> 36:01.163
What...?

36:01.165 --> 36:04.567
This dress is a mosquito net.

36:04.569 --> 36:07.069
Then maybe you'll catch something in it.

36:07.071 --> 36:09.172
- DINA: Yeah, a man.
- SASHA: Lisa, you look

36:09.174 --> 36:11.674
- like somebody's Puerto Rican grandmother.
- See?

36:11.676 --> 36:13.143
Now, men'll fuck almost anything,

36:13.145 --> 36:14.680
but not you... in that outfit.

36:17.415 --> 36:19.748
Don't even. I already know.

36:19.750 --> 36:22.451
Tighten that up.

36:22.453 --> 36:24.453
Don't be taking all day back there, either,

I'm a bad bitch goddess.

38:07.225 --> 38:08.625
Oh, yes!

38:08.627 --> 38:10.426
Now go out there and slay.

38:10.428 --> 38:12.094
- RYAN: That's it.
- Let's do this.

38:12.096 --> 38:13.696
She ready.

38:13.698 --> 38:16.565
So, hey, I don't mean to be intrusive,

38:16.567 --> 38:19.067
but, um, how many sexual
partners have you had?

38:19.069 --> 38:20.469
(man coughs)

38:20.471 --> 38:22.272
LISA: Are you gay? Straight?

38:22.274 --> 38:23.973
'Cause with the pocket squares and...

38:23.975 --> 38:26.542
I'm not feeling confident about this.

38:26.544 --> 38:27.944
So you're not lactose intolerant?

38:27.946 --> 38:29.946
You give me the smallest bit

38:29.948 --> 38:32.281
of ice cream, and I'm
taking off like a rocket.

38:37.055 --> 38:39.054

38:39.056 --> 38:40.723
And you know what I do every morning

38:40.725 --> 38:42.458
when I make my morning shake?

38:42.460 --> 38:45.395
I take a little bit of that
placenta, plop it right inside.

38:45.397 --> 38:47.996
- Ugh!
- Grind it up, throw it back.

38:47.998 --> 38:51.500
I'm telling you, I'm gonna
live till I'm a hundred.

38:51.502 --> 38:53.502

Of Sasha's Secrets.

39:15.660 --> 39:21.431
Miss Vanzant, it is such an honor to even

39:21.433 --> 39:24.167
- be in the same...
- So, so, come,

39:24.169 --> 39:27.837
missy, and let me holler
at you for a minute.

39:27.839 --> 39:30.440
Okay.

39:30.442 --> 39:32.975
Do you know who I am?

39:32.977 --> 39:35.178
Yeah. I just said...

39:35.180 --> 39:37.714
- I just said...
- 'Cause either you don't know,

39:37.716 --> 39:40.183
or some strange affliction has altered

39:40.185 --> 39:43.018
the molecular structure of your brain.

39:43.020 --> 39:45.855
If you think that you can trash

39:45.857 --> 39:47.723
- my name and reputation just to make...
- (phone chimes)

39:47.725 --> 39:49.192
...a name for yourself, missy,

39:49.194 --> 39:51.560
that is not gonna turn out well for you.

39:51.562 --> 39:53.129
N-No. Look, I'm just the messenger.

39:53.131 --> 39:55.031
I thought you looked great in that thong.

39:55.033 --> 39:57.500
Liar!

39:57.502 --> 39:59.301
Try me again,

39:59.303 --> 40:02.672
and I promise you

40:02.674 --> 40:06.576
that you and I are gonna have
a Middle Passage experience,

40:06.578 --> 40:10.045
a fight for survival, and I will win.

40:10.047 --> 40:13.850
Have I made myself clear?

40:13.852 --> 40:15.250
Clear?!

40:15.252 --> 40:17.487
Clear.

40:17.489 --> 40:19.688
Oh. Okay, thank you, beloved. (laughs)

40:19.690 --> 40:23.225
Blessings to you, and you
enjoy the rest of your evening.

40:23.227 --> 40:24.893
(Vanzant laughs)

40:24.895 --> 40:27.163
Shoot. Yes, tell me it recorded.

40:27.165 --> 40:29.232
Please tell me I've got that on video.

40:29.234 --> 40:31.167
Come on, please.

40:31.169 --> 40:33.036
Damn it!

40:33.038 --> 40:34.437
Damn it, Sasha.

40:34.439 --> 40:36.071
That was your car and your mortgage.

40:36.073 --> 40:40.042
- Hey, uh, Sasha?
- Yeah.

40:40.044 --> 40:42.545
Listen, do you, uh, mind
not working right now?

40:42.547 --> 40:46.348
Well, what do you call what you're doing?

40:46.350 --> 40:48.884
No. I'm just saying
that I don't want anyone

40:48.886 --> 40:51.087
to feel uncomfortable thinking
that you're spying on them.

40:51.089 --> 40:52.688
- That's all.
- Ryan, I don't spy on people.

40:52.690 --> 40:54.290
Okay. I'm sorry.

40:54.292 --> 40:57.225
I'm just saying that I'm
their guest, you're my guest.

40:57.227 --> 41:00.462
Are you telling me to behave?

41:00.464 --> 41:01.897
Is that what you telling me right now?

41:01.899 --> 41:03.299
No. I'm just saying that

41:03.301 --> 41:05.033
it would be more
appropriate and effective...

41:05.035 --> 41:06.603
- Um, Sasha? Sasha?
- What is appropriate and effective?

41:06.605 --> 41:08.203
These words you're using on me feel real...

41:08.205 --> 41:10.640
I think you should come with
me to the bathroom, please.

41:10.642 --> 41:12.641
- Real quick. I got snaps and zippers and...
- (Ryan sighs)

41:12.643 --> 41:14.444
- But she's...
- ...all kinds of things that I need help with.

41:14.446 --> 41:16.045
Lisa, I know... Lisa,
I know what you're doing.

41:16.047 --> 41:17.413
DINA (with English accent):
What part of England

41:17.415 --> 41:19.114
are you from... Compton, England?

41:19.116 --> 41:21.551
- Come on, Estelle. Darling, yes, look at us.
- No. No.

41:21.553 --> 41:23.886
Two conquerors taking over the world.

41:23.888 --> 41:26.489
Don't be a bugger! Pip, pip, cheerio.

41:26.491 --> 41:27.957
- No.
- I'll tag you.

41:27.959 --> 41:29.324
- Please don't.
- I'll be tagging you in this.

41:29.326 --> 41:30.926
- Oh, please don't.
- What are you doing?

41:30.928 --> 41:32.395
What? I'm taking fun
pictures with celebrities.

41:32.397 --> 41:34.096
I'm talking to celebrities and everything.

41:34.098 --> 41:35.665
(man clears throat)

41:35.667 --> 41:37.799
- Glad to see some things ain't changed.
- RYAN: Julian!

41:37.801 --> 41:40.169
- Oh, my God!
- Look at you. You got muscles now.

41:40.171 --> 41:42.105
Ah. What up, D?

41:42.107 --> 41:43.906
DINA: What's up, boy?

41:43.908 --> 41:46.109
- Look at you.
- Look, man, you got fine.

41:46.111 --> 41:47.409
- (laughter)
- Ryan.

41:47.411 --> 41:48.645
- It's good to see you.
- Wow.

41:48.647 --> 41:49.846
I thought that was you.

41:49.848 --> 41:52.315
I cannot believe I'm looking at half

41:52.317 --> 41:53.850
of the Flossy Posse.

41:53.852 --> 41:56.518
- Mm-hmm.
- And the other half is here, too.

41:56.520 --> 41:58.254
- No shit.
- (laughing): Yes.

41:58.256 --> 42:01.123
- The whole entire FP crew is in the building?
- Mm-hmm.

42:01.125 --> 42:03.158
- Okay, it's official now.
- (laughter)

42:03.160 --> 42:04.661
Wow, so you playing this weekend?

42:04.663 --> 42:07.129
Yeah, I'm actually sitting in with Ne-Yo

42:07.131 --> 42:08.330
at the House of Blues on Saturday.

42:08.332 --> 42:09.699
Ne-Yo? I
love Ne-Yo.

42:09.701 --> 42:12.034
Well, y'all should come through. Swing by.

42:12.036 --> 42:13.301
I will put you on a list.

42:13.303 --> 42:15.138
- It's nothing.
- Okay, we're there.

42:15.140 --> 42:16.471
- Good.
- DINA: Yeah, we there.

42:16.473 --> 42:17.507
Mm.

42:17.509 --> 42:19.344
Okay. (chuckles)

42:20.879 --> 42:23.279
Uh, so what you drinking?

42:23.281 --> 42:25.681
Sash, I just brought you in here, okay,

42:25.683 --> 42:28.518
so that you can have a
little compassion for Ryan

42:28.520 --> 42:30.386
and everything that she's going through.

42:30.388 --> 42:33.355
So, I'm asking you to please be nice.

42:33.357 --> 42:34.723
I'm trying.

42:34.725 --> 42:36.158
I mean, she is the one

42:36.160 --> 42:38.627
giving me grief about doing my job.

42:38.629 --> 42:40.629
You know, we can't all
just smile for the cameras

42:40.631 --> 42:42.130
and sit next to a football player

42:42.132 --> 42:43.165
and make money off of him.

42:43.167 --> 42:45.134
Ooh, now, Sasha,

01:00:05.007 --> 01:00:06.741
Ooh, girl!

01:00:06.743 --> 01:00:08.210
- Mash that meat.
- Girl, put your back into it!

01:00:08.212 --> 01:00:09.611
WOMAN: Beat it!

01:00:09.613 --> 01:00:13.547
If your arms ain't tired,
you ain't been cookin'.

01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:15.216
- (laughter)
- Who knew?

01:00:15.218 --> 01:00:18.185
Kitchen shears... this is
an underutilized utensil

01:00:18.187 --> 01:00:20.121
- in the kitchen.
- Well, I am gonna take

01:00:20.123 --> 01:00:21.890
this underutilized tool,

01:00:21.892 --> 01:00:24.391
and I'm gonna put it on
this over-utilized sausage.

01:00:24.393 --> 01:00:26.460
(laughter)

01:00:26.462 --> 01:00:27.962
Ooh!

01:00:27.964 --> 01:00:30.531
What does that look like,
hanging like that, to you?

01:00:30.533 --> 01:00:31.766
I don't know,

01:00:31.768 --> 01:00:34.136
but we gonna cut it off today.

01:00:34.138 --> 01:00:35.870
- (laughter)
- Oh, my God.

01:00:35.872 --> 01:00:37.705
Ryan's a hoot.

01:00:37.707 --> 01:00:39.708
- She's a hoot.
- Yes.

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:41.542
She's a hoot.

01:00:41.544 --> 01:00:44.578
(under breath): What the fuck is going on?

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:47.281
I'm still waiting on my sausage.

01:00:47.283 --> 01:00:49.216
Oh. Well, here, have some of mine.

01:00:49.218 --> 01:00:50.320
(laughter, shouting)

01:00:51.788 --> 01:00:53.888
- (coughing)
- Gaggin'. You gaggin'?

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:58.092
CARLA: Now, that, my friends,
is the essence of cooking.

01:00:58.094 --> 01:01:01.062
That was fucking amazing.

01:01:01.064 --> 01:01:03.832
The crowd loved it. Bethany loved it.

01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:06.100
Were those your girls? I
thought there was only three.

01:01:06.102 --> 01:01:08.335
Who-who was the hottie
with the badunkadunk?

01:01:08.337 --> 01:01:10.004
The junk in the trunk. That can had

01:01:10.006 --> 01:01:12.774
its own soundtrack, am I
right? (hums dance beat)

01:01:12.776 --> 01:01:15.109
- She's nobody.
- I've never seen her before.

01:01:15.111 --> 01:01:17.812
Oh, crap. I got to go get her
number, 'cause she was amazing.

01:01:17.814 --> 01:01:19.948
- She's worth it.
- BOTH: No!

01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:21.650
Okay, okay. Okay.

01:01:21.652 --> 01:01:24.585
You know what, it's better
if it's improvised, anyway.

01:01:24.587 --> 01:01:27.288
Stewart, there is a reporter out there

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:29.324
who is a big football fan.

01:01:29.326 --> 01:01:31.525
Can I just borrow you for a minute?

01:01:31.527 --> 01:01:33.761
Ooh. So tense.

01:01:33.763 --> 01:01:35.163
Little tight.

01:01:35.165 --> 01:01:37.031
Come on, buddy, loosen it up.

01:01:37.033 --> 01:01:38.635
(exhales)

01:01:39.837 --> 01:01:42.337
(takes deep breath)

01:01:42.339 --> 01:01:44.004
(quietly): I am...

01:01:44.006 --> 01:01:45.339
strong.

01:01:45.341 --> 01:01:46.975
I am... powerful.

01:01:46.977 --> 01:01:48.210
I am beautiful.

01:01:48.212 --> 01:01:50.011
I am... strong.

01:01:50.013 --> 01:01:52.013
(crying): I am...

01:01:52.015 --> 01:01:53.614
powerful.

01:01:53.616 --> 01:01:55.616
(applause, whistling, whooping in distance)

01:01:55.618 --> 01:01:57.451
I am beautiful. I am...

01:01:57.453 --> 01:01:59.286
(panting): I am...

01:01:59.288 --> 01:02:01.455
strong.

01:02:01.457 --> 01:02:03.958
I am powerful.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.527
I am beautiful.

01:02:05.529 --> 01:02:07.295
I am strong.

01:02:07.297 --> 01:02:09.630
I am... powerful. I am beautiful.

01:02:09.632 --> 01:02:10.632
I am strong.

01:02:10.634 --> 01:02:12.333
You good, Ry?

01:02:12.335 --> 01:02:14.569
Yeah, I'm good.

01:02:14.571 --> 01:02:17.404
All in a day's work, right? (chuckles)

01:02:17.406 --> 01:02:19.040
Thanks for having my back up there.

01:02:19.042 --> 01:02:20.875
(scoffs) Of course.

01:02:20.877 --> 01:02:22.042
Yeah.

01:02:22.044 --> 01:02:25.145
(women conversing indistinctly)

01:02:25.147 --> 01:02:26.882
- Ry.
- Hmm?

01:02:26.884 --> 01:02:29.850
You can't keep pretending
that this photo doesn't exist.

01:02:29.852 --> 01:02:31.185
It's gonna get out there.

01:02:31.187 --> 01:02:33.154
It's all fair game in journalism.

01:02:33.156 --> 01:02:34.355
Journalism?

01:02:34.357 --> 01:02:35.826
Is that what this is?

01:02:37.861 --> 01:02:40.094
Fine, you just keep handling your business.

01:02:40.096 --> 01:02:43.864
You've been doing such
a great job thus far.

01:02:43.866 --> 01:02:45.766
All right.

01:02:45.768 --> 01:02:47.705
Fine.

01:02:50.006 --> 01:02:52.406
What do you think I should do?

01:02:52.408 --> 01:02:54.275
Well...

01:02:54.277 --> 01:02:56.411
first of all, let me find out

01:02:56.413 --> 01:02:58.413
if anyone else has the photo.

01:02:58.415 --> 01:03:00.915
And if not, let me leak it.

01:03:00.917 --> 01:03:02.083
Are you crazy?

01:03:02.085 --> 01:03:03.851
No. I am in the middle of a deal.

01:03:03.853 --> 01:03:05.353
I cannot have pictures of him

01:03:05.355 --> 01:03:07.554
kissing another woman on your site. No!

01:03:07.556 --> 01:03:08.924
Hear me out.

01:03:08.926 --> 01:03:11.692
If I leak it... you can get in front of it,

01:03:11.694 --> 01:03:13.929
steer the conversation,
instead of letting TMZ

01:03:13.931 --> 01:03:16.464
write their own bullshit spin on it.

01:03:16.466 --> 01:03:19.904
You find the right angle,
you minimize the damage.

01:03:22.939 --> 01:03:25.473
Okay, just let me think
about it, all right?

01:03:25.475 --> 01:03:27.942
And-and let me talk to a few people first.

01:03:27.944 --> 01:03:29.944
Let me... let me just run it by 'em.

01:03:29.946 --> 01:03:32.614
And can-can you stall them
for a little bit longer?

01:03:32.616 --> 01:03:34.248
I got you.

01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:36.250
(sighs)

01:03:36.252 --> 01:03:38.085
Thank you, Sasha.

01:03:38.087 --> 01:03:40.587
Of course.

01:03:40.589 --> 01:03:43.424
I got Muslim oils, Christian
oils, I got Buddha oils.

01:03:43.426 --> 01:03:44.725
I got ball spray.

01:03:44.727 --> 01:03:45.926
Everybody got a drink.

01:03:45.928 --> 01:03:47.629
- I need a drink.
- MAN: Authentic hurricanes!

01:03:47.631 --> 01:03:50.732
- Two for $25!
- Oh, shoot, there we go, there we go.

01:03:50.734 --> 01:03:53.935
I got something for the kids. I... Ooh.

01:03:53.937 --> 01:03:55.636
- Two for $25?
- $25.

01:03:55.638 --> 01:03:57.237
Wait, wait, wait, hey, hey, hey, beautiful.

01:03:57.239 --> 01:03:58.440
Right here. Come on.

01:03:58.442 --> 01:04:00.442
- Me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, right here.

01:04:00.444 --> 01:04:02.277
(laughs) Sorry. He called me beautiful.

01:04:02.279 --> 01:04:04.011
I'm beautiful now, huh?

01:04:04.013 --> 01:04:05.513
Ooh, Lord, Lord!

01:04:05.515 --> 01:04:07.082
- Hi.
- Whee!

01:04:07.084 --> 01:04:09.083
Got to be careful. Listen, I got... look,

01:04:09.085 --> 01:04:10.652
I see you over there
chasing that hurricane.

01:04:10.654 --> 01:04:12.187
I got the best thing

01:04:12.189 --> 01:04:14.121
- in New Orleans right here.
- What's that?

01:04:14.123 --> 01:04:15.290
Uh...

01:04:15.292 --> 01:04:17.495
Look at that right there.

01:04:19.663 --> 01:04:21.161
What the fuck is that?

01:04:21.163 --> 01:04:22.297
Whoo!

01:04:22.299 --> 01:04:25.533
This is 200-year-old
wormwood absinthe.

01:04:25.535 --> 01:04:26.701
Green Fairy.

01:04:26.703 --> 01:04:28.303
- I want it. Give it to me.
- Hey, hey, hey,

01:04:28.305 --> 01:04:30.270
calm down, now... you don't
know what you're getting into.

01:04:30.272 --> 01:04:33.107
This stuff right here come
with instructions, okay?

01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:35.676
Boy, I don't give a fuck...
that shit is green, shiny,

01:04:35.678 --> 01:04:37.879
and looks like it'll have
me hella bent. I want it.

01:04:37.881 --> 01:04:39.647
Yes, but you're only supposed
to take a splash of this,

01:04:39.649 --> 01:04:41.382
- Okay.
- young lady, because if you drink too much of it,

01:04:41.384 --> 01:04:43.350
it's gonna have you hallucinating.

01:04:43.352 --> 01:04:44.652
- Ooh!
- All right, that's cool with me.

01:04:44.654 --> 01:04:46.187
Now, look, that whole bottle will last you

01:04:46.189 --> 01:04:48.355
- for five years, all right?
- Okay, five months. Got it.

01:04:48.357 --> 01:04:51.558
No, no. Did you hear what
I just said? Five years.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.993
- You're not listening to what I'm...
- Okay.

01:04:52.995 --> 01:04:55.864
- I...
- Five days. This will be used very irresponsibly.

01:04:55.866 --> 01:04:57.899
- Thank you. Sasha!
- Young lady,

01:04:57.901 --> 01:05:00.868

health patient with a fat ass.

01:23:19.434 --> 01:23:21.067
- What is that?
- You've never grapefruited?

01:23:21.069 --> 01:23:23.739
- No, Dina.
- Girl... - Dina...

01:23:29.511 --> 01:23:31.844
Oh, Lord have mercy.

01:23:31.846 --> 01:23:33.614
(chuckles) Oh, my God.

01:23:33.616 --> 01:23:35.582
He is a monster with it.

01:23:35.584 --> 01:23:37.918
I ain't never used two
grapefruits. But wait.

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.652
Let's listen, let's listen, let's listen.

01:23:39.654 --> 01:23:41.120
Five,

01:23:41.122 --> 01:23:42.188
four,

01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:43.789
three,

01:23:43.791 --> 01:23:45.691
two, one.

01:23:45.693 --> 01:23:46.959
(Malik screaming)

01:23:46.961 --> 01:23:50.164
- LISA: Oh!
- MALIK: Lisa!

01:23:50.166 --> 01:23:51.999
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry! I'm gonna get some water.
- Fix it!

01:23:52.001 --> 01:23:53.534
I'm gonna get some water.
The water will wash it out

01:23:53.536 --> 01:23:55.035
- real quick!
- What'd she do, bite it off?

01:23:55.037 --> 01:23:56.536
(Malik screaming)

01:23:56.538 --> 01:23:58.838
I got grapefruit juice
in the pee-pee hole,

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.473
and I need a first aid kit.

01:24:00.475 --> 01:24:03.709
- Lisa! It burns!
- Oh! Oh, my God.

01:24:03.711 --> 01:24:05.111
- I think I left it in my bag.
- My dick is on fire!

01:24:05.113 --> 01:24:06.946
- All I have is eyewash.
- (screaming)

01:24:06.948 --> 01:24:08.382
- Oh, my God!
- It's in my eye, Lisa!

01:24:08.384 --> 01:24:11.185
Okay, just calm down! I
got some cooling cream!

01:24:11.187 --> 01:24:12.886
- I got some aloe. (gasps) Oh, my gosh!
- (shrieks)

01:24:12.888 --> 01:24:14.154
- I'm so sorry!
- You got to do something!

01:24:14.156 --> 01:24:16.557
- It was my first time!
- You said you were a nurse!

01:24:16.559 --> 01:24:18.558
- You said you were a nurse!
- It was an experiment!

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:20.660
- I wanted to try something new!
- Oh, my God! - (moaning)

01:24:20.662 --> 01:24:24.030
What happened to a normal
blow job?! (shrieks)

01:24:24.032 --> 01:24:25.832
Ooh, that's that Shaka Zulu right there.

01:24:25.834 --> 01:24:27.200
LISA: I got some aloe!

01:24:27.202 --> 01:24:29.835
Girl...

01:24:29.837 --> 01:24:32.838
MALIK: <i>What kind of freaky
old-school shit is this?!</i>

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.473
(shrieks)

01:24:34.475 --> 01:24:36.209
(bell clanging)

01:24:36.211 --> 01:24:37.811
SASHA: <i>I'm working on it.</i>

01:24:37.813 --> 01:24:40.880
I will have it to you by
the end of the weekend.

01:24:40.882 --> 01:24:42.716
And it's good. It's good.

01:24:42.718 --> 01:24:44.218
I'm talking 'bout...

01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:47.053
Caitlyn Jenner pregnant by Tyga good.

01:24:47.055 --> 01:24:49.489
Photos to come.

01:24:49.491 --> 01:24:51.225
(Dina speaks indistinctly)

01:24:51.227 --> 01:24:52.859
LISA: Well, guess what, you're
gonna have to do what I say.

01:24:52.861 --> 01:24:56.096
- 'Cause I-I didn't.
- DINA: I'm too cute. I'm too cute to be...

01:24:56.098 --> 01:24:59.368
(Dina speaking indistinctly)

01:25:00.702 --> 01:25:02.268
(Lisa speaks indistinctly)

01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:03.704
Sasha!

01:25:03.706 --> 01:25:05.539
Let's go!

01:25:05.541 --> 01:25:08.909
You don't need no man right now anyway.

01:25:08.911 --> 01:25:11.677
You two have built an incredible brand.

01:25:11.679 --> 01:25:15.615
We think that Ryan and
Stewart can be to Best Mart

01:25:15.617 --> 01:25:19.085
what Martha Stewart is to Kmart but bigger.

01:25:19.087 --> 01:25:20.286
Really?

01:25:20.288 --> 01:25:21.788
Bottom line is that

01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:23.856
you two give people hope

01:25:23.858 --> 01:25:26.426
that you can have it all.

01:25:26.428 --> 01:25:27.927
And we want in.

01:25:27.929 --> 01:25:30.364
(chuckles) That's...

01:25:30.366 --> 01:25:31.932
that's fantastic.

01:25:31.934 --> 01:25:33.600
ELIZABETH: It is.

01:25:33.602 --> 01:25:35.435
It is, but let's be honest,

01:25:35.437 --> 01:25:38.974
it's, uh, all about the offer.

01:25:56.959 --> 01:25:57.958
(clears throat)

01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.095
Holy shit.

01:26:00.461 --> 01:26:02.396
I...

01:26:02.398 --> 01:26:03.730
(clears throat) I mean,

01:26:03.732 --> 01:26:05.798
it's a very good start.

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.602
I'll convene with, uh, my team,

01:26:08.604 --> 01:26:10.306
and we'll-we'll get back to you.

01:26:14.777 --> 01:26:17.177
BETHANY: Sounds good. (clears throat)

01:26:17.179 --> 01:26:19.679
Gentlemen. Ryan.

01:26:19.681 --> 01:26:21.914
- Yes, thank you, Bethany.
- Mm-hmm.

01:26:21.916 --> 01:26:23.917
- Stewart.
- Thank you.

01:26:23.919 --> 01:26:25.584
- (indistinct chatter)
- (cork pops)

01:26:25.586 --> 01:26:27.853
RYAN: Thank you, Best Mart!

01:26:27.855 --> 01:26:29.489
Uh-oh. Get it, get it, get it.

01:26:29.491 --> 01:26:30.824
Ooh!

01:26:30.826 --> 01:26:32.592
- Yes! - Cheers!
- Congrats!

01:26:32.594 --> 01:26:34.593
- Yes!
- Hey, uh, Sasha,

01:26:34.595 --> 01:26:37.196
you think your paparazzi guy
would sell the photo to me?

01:26:37.198 --> 01:26:39.966
We could bury that shit
and just move forward.

01:26:39.968 --> 01:26:42.602
Yeah, um, I mean, um,

01:26:42.604 --> 01:26:43.969
I can find out.

01:26:43.971 --> 01:26:45.172
Why? What's-what's going on?

01:26:45.174 --> 01:26:47.307
Well, ladies,

01:26:47.309 --> 01:26:49.942
Stew and I talked today, and I really think

01:26:49.944 --> 01:26:52.512
our marriage is gonna get back on track.

01:26:52.514 --> 01:26:54.681
Oh.

01:26:54.683 --> 01:26:57.217
So you're gonna take
that community penis back.

01:26:57.219 --> 01:27:00.119
(chuckles) Look, y'all, men have egos.

01:27:00.121 --> 01:27:01.120
His was deflated.

01:27:01.122 --> 01:27:02.489
Retiring, it screwed him up.

01:27:02.491 --> 01:27:04.524
And you know how men are, rudderless,

01:27:04.526 --> 01:27:06.125
needing a purpose.

01:27:06.127 --> 01:27:07.526
All right.

01:27:07.528 --> 01:27:10.629
Used but not broken. (chuckles)

01:27:10.631 --> 01:27:12.199
Well, cheers to that.

01:27:12.201 --> 01:27:14.234
DINA: Cheers, that part, yes.

01:27:14.236 --> 01:27:17.904
- Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- (cheering and applause)

01:27:17.906 --> 01:27:19.172
DINA: Ooh!

01:27:19.174 --> 01:27:21.077
Oh, look. There goes Julian.

01:27:23.245 --> 01:27:24.647

- (laughs)
- I'm serious. You were so good.

01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:17.963
- Well, thank you.
- Like, I can't...

01:28:17.965 --> 01:28:19.566
- I can't even...
- Stop it,

01:28:19.568 --> 01:28:21.234
- stop it, stop it.
- No, I can't believe it.

01:28:21.236 --> 01:28:22.902
You know how far you've
come from when you used

01:28:22.904 --> 01:28:25.237
to make the slow jam
mixtapes back in the day?

01:28:25.239 --> 01:28:27.441
"The J's Slow Jam Mixtape."

01:28:27.443 --> 01:28:29.241
"J's Slow Jams."

01:28:29.243 --> 01:28:32.411
- Those were legendary!
- They were. I'm not gonna front.

01:28:32.413 --> 01:28:34.414
- They were.
- Yes. I'm just,

01:28:34.416 --> 01:28:36.749
- you know, working on my craft.
- Wow. I can tell.

01:28:36.751 --> 01:28:38.084
Did you see those ladies?

01:28:38.086 --> 01:28:39.418
They were going crazy for you.

01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:40.419
(chuckles)

01:28:40.421 --> 01:28:42.321
I can see why you're not married.

01:28:42.323 --> 01:28:46.593
Oh. Oh, so now you want
to analyze me, Dr. Pierce?

01:28:46.595 --> 01:28:49.262
- Think that's what we doin'?
- No, I am serious, though.

01:28:49.264 --> 01:28:50.996
Though, be honest, come
on, come on, what is it,

01:28:50.998 --> 01:28:53.232
what is it? You got... commitment issues?

01:28:53.234 --> 01:28:55.401
- (groans) Come on.
- Restless soul?

01:28:55.403 --> 01:28:57.070
A little tortured artist...

01:28:57.072 --> 01:28:59.239
- Why I got to be tortured? No.
- ...who only has time

01:28:59.241 --> 01:29:00.606
for his music?

01:29:00.608 --> 01:29:04.076
Or is it just too much ass to pass up?

01:29:04.078 --> 01:29:05.611
Truthfully?

01:29:05.613 --> 01:29:07.112
Don't lie.

01:29:07.114 --> 01:29:08.615
There's a whole lot of ass out there.

01:29:08.617 --> 01:29:10.616
- (laughing)
- (chuckles) No, no, I'm...

01:29:10.618 --> 01:29:12.352
No, listen, just be honest, be honest.

01:29:12.354 --> 01:29:13.289
What is it?

01:29:14.489 --> 01:29:17.292
I haven't found my equal yet.

01:29:19.661 --> 01:29:22.596
If the right woman came along,

01:29:22.598 --> 01:29:25.001
I'm 100% in.

01:29:26.868 --> 01:29:28.301
DINA: I mean...

01:29:28.303 --> 01:29:29.302
Oh, come on.

01:29:29.304 --> 01:29:30.469
(Dina speaks indistinctly)

01:29:30.471 --> 01:29:31.771
That's true, though.

01:29:31.773 --> 01:29:33.839
- That's not true.
- (laughter)

01:29:33.841 --> 01:29:36.645
You know what I'm sayin'? (chuckles)

01:29:38.679 --> 01:29:40.112
Where you think you're going,

01:29:40.114 --> 01:29:41.515
to get your ass kicked again?

01:29:41.517 --> 01:29:42.949
I need to talk to Ryan.

01:29:42.951 --> 01:29:44.150
That's not gonna happen.

01:29:44.152 --> 01:29:45.788
Let's go.

01:29:51.393 --> 01:29:53.392
How'd you know she was here, anyway?

01:29:53.394 --> 01:29:54.964
(phone beeps)

01:29:57.064 --> 01:29:58.330
Fuck.

01:29:58.332 --> 01:30:00.400
I got to get a new line of work.

01:30:00.402 --> 01:30:03.402
All right, I'll deliver
your message. What's up?

01:30:03.404 --> 01:30:06.405
I just found out I'm pregnant.

01:30:06.407 --> 01:30:10.142
And before you even insult
me, yes, it's Stewart's.

01:30:10.144 --> 01:30:11.710
Does he know?

01:30:11.712 --> 01:30:13.646
I told him, and now this
motherfucker won't return

01:30:13.648 --> 01:30:15.181
any of my calls or texts.

01:30:15.183 --> 01:30:17.851
Aw, let me go find a tear to shed for you.

01:30:17.853 --> 01:30:19.985
I don't need your shade, okay?
That's not why I came here.

01:30:19.987 --> 01:30:21.387
Well, why did you come here?

01:30:21.389 --> 01:30:23.557
Because I didn't make this baby by myself.

01:30:23.559 --> 01:30:26.058
Bottom line, I need Stewart

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:29.663
to call me back within the next
24 hours or I will go public.

01:30:29.665 --> 01:30:33.900
And I might be willing to spill
this tea on your little site,

01:30:33.902 --> 01:30:36.570
give the exclusive to Sasha's Secrets.

01:30:36.572 --> 01:30:38.103
And I have pictures.

01:30:38.105 --> 01:30:40.606
Nasty, freaky pictures, too.

01:30:40.608 --> 01:30:43.178
Think it over.

01:30:48.082 --> 01:30:49.583
(sighs)

01:30:49.585 --> 01:30:51.687
What was that about?

01:30:53.956 --> 01:30:55.254
- JULIAN: You know, you...
- RYAN: Oh, you can tell

01:30:55.256 --> 01:30:56.957
- you got an eye for...
- I...

01:30:56.959 --> 01:30:58.557
- You can tell which ones, which ones.
- Listen, I got a...

01:30:58.559 --> 01:31:00.526
- I got a eye for it all. Tru-Trust me.
- All right.

01:31:00.528 --> 01:31:02.764
- You do.
- Hey, what up, y'all?

01:31:05.367 --> 01:31:07.703
What's wrong?

01:31:10.772 --> 01:31:12.771
I tried everything.

01:31:12.773 --> 01:31:14.774
I...

01:31:14.776 --> 01:31:17.543
I went to all the top specialists.

01:31:17.545 --> 01:31:19.545
I...

01:31:19.547 --> 01:31:24.551
I tried every fertility
treatment on the market and...

01:31:24.553 --> 01:31:25.921
nothing.

01:31:30.058 --> 01:31:32.728
She gave him what I couldn't.

01:31:35.764 --> 01:31:37.931
Why didn't you...

01:31:37.933 --> 01:31:41.567
tell us that you were having
a problem getting pregnant?

01:31:41.569 --> 01:31:44.471
Because I was embarrassed.

01:31:44.473 --> 01:31:46.975
I didn't want anyone to know.

01:31:51.513 --> 01:31:53.746
Look what I did.

01:31:53.748 --> 01:31:55.515
That's their baby.

01:31:55.517 --> 01:31:58.017
I took a pug and I put that with Stewart

01:31:58.019 --> 01:32:00.853
and made this bitch baby.

01:32:00.855 --> 01:32:02.254
And they can have that
little bitch-ass baby.

01:32:02.256 --> 01:32:04.089
It's gonna have a big ol' booty

01:32:04.091 --> 01:32:06.926
- and a ugly-ass face, just like his mama.
- Mm.

01:32:06.928 --> 01:32:08.628
And then I made a variety of babies,

01:32:08.630 --> 01:32:11.830
in case they decide to have
a litter of bitch babies.

01:32:11.832 --> 01:32:13.365
- Little pound puppies.
- (chuckling)

01:32:13.367 --> 01:32:16.535
- (knocking) - And they gonna
make a ugly-ass bitch baby.

01:32:16.537 --> 01:32:18.471
You understand me?

01:32:18.473 --> 01:32:20.306
I love you.

01:32:20.308 --> 01:32:21.473
Look at that baby.

01:32:21.475 --> 01:32:23.209
Look like it licks its own ass.

01:32:23.211 --> 01:32:25.445
- (Ryan chuckles)
- That's how ugly that baby is.

01:32:25.447 --> 01:32:27.179
- That one.
- (Ryan and Dina chuckle)

01:32:27.181 --> 01:32:29.015
- DINA: That's a ugly-ass baby, ain't it?
- (Ryan chuckling)

01:32:29.017 --> 01:32:30.683
It's Stewart.

01:32:30.685 --> 01:32:32.185
The hell?

01:32:32.187 --> 01:32:33.619
STEWART: Ryan,

01:32:33.621 --> 01:32:35.187
please let me in.

01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:36.655
DINA: The hell he want?

01:32:36.657 --> 01:32:38.627
Let him in.

01:32:43.297 --> 01:32:44.800
(sighs)

01:32:48.002 --> 01:32:50.005
You a piece of shit.

01:32:52.674 --> 01:32:54.910
(door closes)

01:32:57.879 --> 01:33:00.149
We need to talk.

01:33:03.818 --> 01:33:06.085
Alone.

01:33:06.087 --> 01:33:08.353
There ain't nothing you need to say to her

01:33:08.355 --> 01:33:09.923
that you can't say in front of us.

01:33:09.925 --> 01:33:11.327
Mm-hmm.

01:33:15.863 --> 01:33:17.864
Uh, it's okay.

01:33:17.866 --> 01:33:19.769
It's okay.

01:33:21.670 --> 01:33:23.339
We'll wait for you downstairs.

01:33:24.672 --> 01:33:26.573
Here, take my stun gun.

01:33:26.575 --> 01:33:29.042
Now, this button right here...
it raises the voltage of it.

01:33:29.044 --> 01:33:30.877
As a matter of fact,
you know what? Fuck it.

01:33:30.879 --> 01:33:32.445
I'm gonna just leave it on high.

01:33:32.447 --> 01:33:33.879
All right? And just tag him

01:33:33.881 --> 01:33:35.718
right in the balls if he do something.

01:33:37.051 --> 01:33:39.185
Both balls.

01:33:39.187 --> 01:33:41.290
Dick, too.

01:33:50.197 --> 01:33:52.300
I spoke with Simone.

01:33:54.202 --> 01:33:57.603
She agreed to sign an NDA

01:33:57.605 --> 01:33:59.705
in exchange for a monthly payment

01:33:59.707 --> 01:34:01.307
for her and the baby.

01:34:01.309 --> 01:34:04.377
I could... kill you.

01:34:04.379 --> 01:34:06.948
I am so furious right now.

01:34:08.282 --> 01:34:11.450
And you have every right to be.

01:34:11.452 --> 01:34:13.786
Do you even...

01:34:13.788 --> 01:34:16.157
love me anymore?

01:34:17.492 --> 01:34:19.758
Of course I do.

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:22.462
I made a terrible mistake.

01:34:22.464 --> 01:34:24.297
(sighs)

01:34:24.299 --> 01:34:28.334
I know you can't trust me
as your husband anymore,

01:34:28.336 --> 01:34:32.070
but you can trust me as your partner.

01:34:32.072 --> 01:34:37.442
This deal will set us up for life.

01:34:37.444 --> 01:34:39.978
But we can't do it apart.

01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:44.083
Ryan without Stewart...

01:34:44.085 --> 01:34:46.322
doesn't have it all.

01:34:51.193 --> 01:34:54.526
(sighs heavily)

01:34:54.528 --> 01:34:57.429
I just hope she kicked his cheatin' ass out

01:34:57.431 --> 01:35:00.333
and tagged his dick skin
till it fried like bacon.

01:35:00.335 --> 01:35:02.101
- Mm-hmm.
- Damn, Lis.

01:35:02.103 --> 01:35:04.204
I thought you wanted them to work it out.

01:35:04.206 --> 01:35:05.637
Yeah, well, I changed my mind

01:35:05.639 --> 01:35:07.507
as soon as I saw his arrogant face,

01:35:07.509 --> 01:35:11.343
so fuck him and that disaster
of a woman he impregnated.

01:35:11.345 --> 01:35:13.279
- SASHA: Amen.
- DINA: Mm-hmm.

01:35:13.281 --> 01:35:14.681
LISA: Unbelievable.

01:35:14.683 --> 01:35:16.950
And she's been up there too long.

01:35:16.952 --> 01:35:19.288
Oh, what the hell's going on?

01:35:24.559 --> 01:35:26.159
What in the...?

01:35:26.161 --> 01:35:27.793
- Fuck?
- Damn.

01:35:27.795 --> 01:35:29.294
The fuck?

01:35:29.296 --> 01:35:31.164
LISA: Why is she doing that?

01:35:31.166 --> 01:35:33.700
- Mm.
- Really, though?

01:35:33.702 --> 01:35:36.668
(Sasha sighs)

01:35:36.670 --> 01:35:37.669
(Lisa sighs)

01:35:37.671 --> 01:35:39.575
- The fuck?
- Damn.

01:35:40.908 --> 01:35:43.179
(sighs)

01:35:47.248 --> 01:35:48.882
Are you staying with him?

01:35:48.884 --> 01:35:51.584
Stew figured out a way to
handle the Simone situation,

01:35:51.586 --> 01:35:53.352
so it's gonna be fine.

01:35:53.354 --> 01:35:54.987
Oh, wait. No, hold up. Stop. Wait.

01:35:54.989 --> 01:35:58.091
So, he dickmatized you that quick?

01:35:58.093 --> 01:36:00.093
Dina, he's my husband.

01:36:00.095 --> 01:36:01.727
He's not some guy in a bathroom stall.

01:36:01.729 --> 01:36:04.163
- Mm?
- I'm not just gonna throw everything away.

01:36:04.165 --> 01:36:06.766
You know what? Ry, I get it.

01:36:06.768 --> 01:36:08.567
'Cause when I was leaving
Terrence, I was terrified.

01:36:08.569 --> 01:36:10.003
- (ringtone plays)
- I didn't think

01:36:10.005 --> 01:36:11.337
I was gonna be able to do it on my own,

01:36:11.339 --> 01:36:12.771
but I've been figuring it out.

01:36:12.773 --> 01:36:14.240
- You will, too.
- Mm-hmm.

01:36:14.242 --> 01:36:15.408
I'll help you.

01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:18.244
Lisa, that's sweet, but I'm not like you.

01:36:18.246 --> 01:36:20.282
You don't understand. I
can't live with my mother.

01:36:21.616 --> 01:36:24.616
Well... well, what is wrong

01:36:24.618 --> 01:36:27.552
with living with your
mother? I... I love my mother.

01:36:27.554 --> 01:36:29.422
You don't get it. You all can't get it.

01:36:29.424 --> 01:36:30.890
You're not in my world.

01:36:30.892 --> 01:36:32.892
You don't live my life.

01:36:32.894 --> 01:36:34.627
I can't just walk away from that.

01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:35.895
I give people hope.

01:36:35.897 --> 01:36:37.195
- I don't have a choice.
- (ringtone plays)

01:36:37.197 --> 01:36:39.399
Where is your hope? This is you choosing,

01:36:39.401 --> 01:36:41.401
and this choice is diminishing you.

01:36:41.403 --> 01:36:43.302
Diminishing me?

01:36:43.304 --> 01:36:45.304
Says the woman who chooses

01:36:45.306 --> 01:36:49.275
to talk shit about people for a living?

01:36:49.277 --> 01:36:51.410
Way to use that journalism degree, Sash.

01:36:51.412 --> 01:36:53.279
- (ringtone playing)
- Look, I got to pay bills.

01:36:53.281 --> 01:36:56.214
And for the record, I
have multiple degrees.

01:36:56.216 --> 01:36:57.450
- Hey, hey.
- Then use one of 'em.

01:36:57.452 --> 01:36:59.118
How you gonna tell me to use 'em?

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.587
All right. Let's have a time
- out. Just a little breather.

01:37:01.589 --> 01:37:04.824
- And just take a moment.
- Yes! Hello. - (phone dings)

01:37:04.826 --> 01:37:06.793
- ELIZABETH: Ryan, have you seen it?
- Oh, they trippin'.

01:37:06.795 --> 01:37:08.628
- RYAN: What? - Oh, shit.
- ELIZABETH: Fuckin' Simone.

01:37:08.630 --> 01:37:10.929
- Is that that bitch from the demo?
- Wait.

01:37:10.931 --> 01:37:12.731
ELIZABETH: Have you been on
the Internet? It's a disaster.

01:37:12.733 --> 01:37:14.834
- It's just a shit show. All right, I'm gonna fix it.
- Oh.

01:37:14.836 --> 01:37:16.069
- Hell, no.
- ELIZABETH: All right, I got to fix this.

01:37:16.071 --> 01:37:17.070
All right, bye. Bye. Bye.

01:37:17.072 --> 01:37:18.838
RYAN: You conniving...

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.306
You are sneaky.

01:37:20.308 --> 01:37:22.075
All right, all right,
everybody, let's just...

01:37:22.077 --> 01:37:23.810
- How could you do that?
- You think I did this?

01:37:23.812 --> 01:37:25.911
I didn't do this. Simone must have.

01:37:25.913 --> 01:37:29.515
Simone, who you were huddled
up, talking to in the corner?

01:37:29.517 --> 01:37:31.918
Huh? That Simone?

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:33.785
Wait. What did you do? Did you...

01:37:33.787 --> 01:37:36.455
Did you sell it to another
site to cover your tracks?

01:37:36.457 --> 01:37:37.957
- Are you serious?
- Because you know what?

01:37:37.959 --> 01:37:39.359
I know you're broke.

01:37:39.361 --> 01:37:41.093
I see you hiding your tags in your shirt.

01:37:41.095 --> 01:37:44.297
We all see it. I'm not stupid.

01:37:44.299 --> 01:37:45.365
- OTHERS: Yeah.
- LISA: It happens.

01:37:45.367 --> 01:37:46.766
- You know, I mean...
- Yeah, I mean, we know

01:37:46.768 --> 01:37:48.334
- them ain't no real Red Bottoms.
- I shop at Goodwill.

01:37:48.336 --> 01:37:49.668
You know, Nordstrom's do take stuff back.

01:37:49.670 --> 01:37:51.771
That's what's so cool
about Nordstrom's, you know,

01:37:51.773 --> 01:37:53.839
- Nordstrom's takes every...
- Congratulations, Sash.

01:37:53.841 --> 01:37:57.442
You know what? I really
hope it was worth it!

01:37:57.444 --> 01:37:59.978
You know what? Hey.

01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:02.448
Hey! The fucking thought did cross my mind,

01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:05.651
but I would never play you
out like that for some money.

01:38:05.653 --> 01:38:08.221
The problem is, you never
valued our friendship

01:38:08.223 --> 01:38:09.554
as much as I did.

01:38:09.556 --> 01:38:11.156
How could you say that?

01:38:11.158 --> 01:38:13.392
You are like a sister
to me. I have always...

01:38:13.394 --> 01:38:16.396
This how you treat a sister? I
quit my job at <i>The Times</i>

01:38:16.398 --> 01:38:18.063
to get our website off the ground.

01:38:18.065 --> 01:38:19.499
I hired a designer.

01:38:19.501 --> 01:38:21.667
And what did you do? What'd you do, sis?

01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:23.035
- You left me high and dry.
- (Ryan scoffs)

01:38:23.037 --> 01:38:24.503
Because you thought

01:38:24.505 --> 01:38:26.571
that you could get more
success with Stewart.

01:38:26.573 --> 01:38:29.674
Why you think I'm doing this
bullshit gossip blog anyway?

01:38:29.676 --> 01:38:31.576
And not-not once did you apologize.

01:38:31.578 --> 01:38:33.846
If you would have told me
no, I wouldn't have done it.

01:38:33.848 --> 01:38:35.380
You should have spoken up!

01:38:35.382 --> 01:38:37.816
How the fuck do I compete with pillow talk?

01:38:37.818 --> 01:38:40.652
Dickmatized, just like she said.

01:38:40.654 --> 01:38:42.588
And, well, you could
have said no, though...

01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:44.757
- Dina, nobody asked you!
- Sasha, just listen to Ryan

01:38:44.759 --> 01:38:46.191
for a second. She's trying to explain!

01:38:46.193 --> 01:38:47.893
You know what? Stop
it. Stop it. I should...

01:38:47.895 --> 01:38:49.695
I should know better
than to expect y'all two

01:38:49.697 --> 01:38:51.030
to have my back anyway.

01:38:51.032 --> 01:38:53.332
See, I know how it works in this circle.

01:38:53.334 --> 01:38:54.767
We got the queen bee,

01:38:54.769 --> 01:38:56.701
and we got her two little worker bees.

01:38:56.703 --> 01:38:58.771
- LISA: What?!
- Worker bee? Bitch, who you talking about

01:38:58.773 --> 01:39:01.240
a worker bee? I'm my own bee.
No, you take that shit back.

01:39:01.242 --> 01:39:03.209
- Take that shit back.
- I'm not taking it back.

01:39:03.211 --> 01:39:04.776
All right, all right, stop!
Just everybody take a time-out.

01:39:04.778 --> 01:39:06.212
So what? Whether I need
'em or not, I like 'em.

01:39:06.214 --> 01:39:07.612
Pull it back. Time-out.

01:39:07.614 --> 01:39:09.248
Why don't you shut the fuck up

01:39:09.250 --> 01:39:11.350
and stop talking to us
like we're one of your kids?

01:39:11.352 --> 01:39:13.085
Wait a minute. You'd better pause

01:39:13.087 --> 01:39:14.920
and stop acting like one of my kids.

01:39:14.922 --> 01:39:16.955
How about that? Put some clothes on.

01:39:16.957 --> 01:39:18.391
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to tell you...

01:48:13.661 --> 01:48:15.160
- You call.
- Let's go, let's go.

01:48:15.162 --> 01:48:17.933
- I might be pregnant right now.
- Okay, let's get Ryan.

01:48:19.065 --> 01:48:20.499
RYAN: <i>Uh...</i>

01:48:20.501 --> 01:48:23.435
as most of you know, there
have been many questions

01:48:23.437 --> 01:48:25.670
about the status of my marriage.

01:48:25.672 --> 01:48:29.141
And I would like to put
those rumors to rest.

01:48:29.143 --> 01:48:33.445
The picture that surfaced
this morning isn't real.

01:48:33.447 --> 01:48:37.783
All allegations of infidelity are false.

01:48:37.785 --> 01:48:39.951
My husband and I remain

01:48:39.953 --> 01:48:42.855
in a loving, faithful marriage.

01:48:42.857 --> 01:48:44.823
- WOMAN: Yeah!
- In fact...

01:48:44.825 --> 01:48:46.691
- (cheering, applause)
- RYAN: Yes! Thank you!

01:48:46.693 --> 01:48:47.995
(laughs)

01:48:50.965 --> 01:48:52.597
DINA: Step back, fool!

01:48:52.599 --> 01:48:56.203
SASHA: You... Dina, I don't... What?

01:48:57.971 --> 01:49:01.039
LISA: Ooh. Oh, God. Oh.

01:49:01.041 --> 01:49:03.709
Um... go ahead, Ryan.

01:49:03.711 --> 01:49:06.512
Don't... don't mind us.

01:49:06.514 --> 01:49:07.646
(audience murmuring)

01:49:07.648 --> 01:49:10.816
Um, in fact...

01:49:10.818 --> 01:49:13.985
our marriage is...

01:49:13.987 --> 01:49:16.054
stronger than ever.

01:49:16.056 --> 01:49:18.193
- (applause)
- (quietly): Come on, Ry.

01:49:20.694 --> 01:49:23.831
The foun... the foundation...

01:49:25.532 --> 01:49:27.334
(quietly): The foundation of...

01:49:34.507 --> 01:49:36.344
I'm sorry, uh...

01:49:38.245 --> 01:49:42.313
My agent wrote a very convincing statement

01:49:42.315 --> 01:49:44.883
- for me to read to you.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:49:44.885 --> 01:49:46.218
And I really...

01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:48.553
thought that I could go through with it,

01:49:48.555 --> 01:49:51.089
because I have done such a...

01:49:51.091 --> 01:49:54.595
great job of pretending
so many times before.

01:49:55.996 --> 01:49:58.329
But...

01:49:58.331 --> 01:50:01.033
there are some people...

01:50:01.035 --> 01:50:03.835
when you see them...

01:50:03.837 --> 01:50:06.704
you just can't pretend anymore.

01:50:06.706 --> 01:50:09.074
Because they know...

01:50:09.076 --> 01:50:10.845
you.

01:50:12.345 --> 01:50:14.279
The real you.

01:50:14.281 --> 01:50:18.517
And maybe that's why you
avoided seeing them...

01:50:18.519 --> 01:50:20.221
for so long.

01:50:22.756 --> 01:50:24.024
(whispering): I'm sorry.

01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:27.793
(sighs)

01:50:27.795 --> 01:50:29.397
Uh...

01:50:31.732 --> 01:50:33.865
I'm not perfect.

01:50:33.867 --> 01:50:36.401
I do not have it all.

01:50:36.403 --> 01:50:38.137
- WOMAN: Okay.
- WOMAN 2: It's okay, Ryan.

01:50:38.139 --> 01:50:41.205
In fact, my life is all kind of screwed up.

01:50:41.207 --> 01:50:42.708
(people speaking indistinctly)

01:50:42.710 --> 01:50:44.142
All right, maybe we should take...

01:50:44.144 --> 01:50:46.311
Sit your ass down.

01:50:46.313 --> 01:50:47.815
(gasping, indistinct chatter)

01:50:50.283 --> 01:50:51.784
Now.

01:50:51.786 --> 01:50:54.085
- (shouts, cheers)
- Yes! That part!

01:50:54.087 --> 01:50:56.554
Finally! Finally!

01:50:56.556 --> 01:50:58.126
DINA: Mm-hmm!

01:51:01.828 --> 01:51:03.896
The picture is real.

01:51:03.898 --> 01:51:05.429
(low gasps, groans)

01:51:05.431 --> 01:51:07.900
My husband is having an affair.

01:51:07.902 --> 01:51:10.502
(low chatter, people aw'ing)

01:51:10.504 --> 01:51:14.438
When I first found out, I...

01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.443
well, I felt a lot of things.

01:51:17.778 --> 01:51:19.343
Betrayal, anger,

01:51:19.345 --> 01:51:21.079
heartache.

01:51:21.081 --> 01:51:23.582
But mostly fear.

01:51:23.584 --> 01:51:25.784
Fear that my marriage was ending

01:51:25.786 --> 01:51:27.654
and that I would be alone.

01:51:28.788 --> 01:51:31.693
And I was... terrified of that.

01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:36.527
So terrified that...

01:51:36.529 --> 01:51:40.665
I was willing to stay with
someone who betrayed my trust.

01:51:40.667 --> 01:51:43.936
So terrified that I...

01:51:43.938 --> 01:51:46.838
was willing to accept

01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:49.842
being treated as less than I am.

01:51:49.844 --> 01:51:51.810
And I know I'm not alone in this.

01:51:51.812 --> 01:51:54.346
I know that there are a lot of us who stay

01:51:54.348 --> 01:51:57.115
in bad relationships because
we have convinced ourselves

01:51:57.117 --> 01:51:59.817
that being disrespected
is better than being alone.

01:51:59.819 --> 01:52:03.554
But we shouldn't fear being alone,

01:52:03.556 --> 01:52:06.191
because there is power in rediscovering

01:52:06.193 --> 01:52:08.192
your own voice.

01:52:08.194 --> 01:52:11.362
- WOMAN: Yes!
- And I had forgotten that.

01:52:11.364 --> 01:52:15.400
I forgot that years before
I was... Stewart's wife,

01:52:15.402 --> 01:52:17.071
I was Ryan.

01:52:18.404 --> 01:52:20.838
A girl with her own ambitions

01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:22.843
and her own dreams.

01:52:24.912 --> 01:52:26.848
But luckily...

01:52:29.183 --> 01:52:31.516
...my girls...

01:52:31.518 --> 01:52:35.721
my girls... reminded me of that.

01:52:35.723 --> 01:52:37.422
(quietly): Flossy Posse.

01:52:37.424 --> 01:52:41.826
They reminded me of my own worth...

01:52:41.828 --> 01:52:43.395
- Damn right.
- Mm-hmm. - Yep.

01:52:43.397 --> 01:52:47.769
...and that there was a time
that I didn't fear anything.

01:52:50.737 --> 01:52:54.239
No one has the power to shatter your dreams

01:52:54.241 --> 01:52:56.775
unless you give it to them.

01:52:56.777 --> 01:52:59.011
WOMAN: Ryan, speak.

01:52:59.013 --> 01:53:02.847
And I refuse to give
anyone that power again.

01:53:02.849 --> 01:53:05.284

01:53:10.256 --> 01:53:13.091
that me revealing my truth

01:53:13.093 --> 01:53:16.430
