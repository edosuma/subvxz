WEBVTT

00:02.636 --> 00:05.004
Suddenly, I'm not so sure.

00:05.072 --> 00:07.840
Madisson had been chasing Ben
for years.

00:07.908 --> 00:09.308
Finally she got him.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.043
You wanna be my girlfriend?
Yeah.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.679
(Juliette)
And then immediately
he's flirting with Tawni.

00:13.748 --> 00:14.880
I just know,
if you were my man,

00:14.949 --> 00:16.115
I wouldn't be doing
something like that.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.149
What would you do?

00:17.218 --> 00:18.684
A couple things come
to mind.

00:18.753 --> 00:20.919
(Juliette)
Brandon seems
pretty confused too.

00:20.988 --> 00:23.522
Like he's more into Madisson
than his own girlfriend.

00:23.591 --> 00:26.158
What the (bleep) just happened?
Like, why would you do that?

00:26.227 --> 00:29.628
(Juliette)
And Chloe's behavior has been
every bit as sketchy.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.196
She's been on Team Cara...

00:31.265 --> 00:33.399
If I wanna bring
my friend Cara around,

00:33.467 --> 00:35.334
sorry, I don't
owe you anything.

00:35.403 --> 00:36.735
(Juliette)
...and on Team Juliette.

00:36.804 --> 00:39.938
I just wanna hang out
with you guys again.
Aww.

00:40.007 --> 00:41.940
But no one's more confused
than me.

00:42.009 --> 00:45.177
My relationship with Alex
is all over the place.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.645
I'm sorry.
You hurt me.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.180
Are you gonna say,
"I'm sorry"?
Listen!

00:48.249 --> 00:49.748
No!
Okay, fine.

00:49.817 --> 00:50.816
Stop!

00:50.885 --> 00:52.484
Sometimes he treats me
like (bleep),

00:52.553 --> 00:54.219
and I think it's all over,

00:54.288 --> 00:56.221
but then, I don't know,
he wins me back.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.657
Of course I wanna be
with you, Juliette.

00:58.726 --> 01:02.528
That's why I'm still here
and willing to make this work.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.530
(Juliette)
But after what I saw
this morning...

01:04.598 --> 01:07.933
I literally walked in on him
sleeping with a girl.

01:08.002 --> 01:10.469
...I don't think there's
any going back.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.341
(Juliette sobbing)

01:16.410 --> 01:18.977
Jules, like, he so
doesn't deserve you.

01:19.046 --> 01:21.213
He really doesn't.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.382
(sobbing continues)

01:26.787 --> 01:29.121
I see him and I see
the girl in his bed,

01:29.190 --> 01:31.457
and she's, like,
literally, like,
turned around,

01:31.525 --> 01:33.025
like, sleeping.

01:33.094 --> 01:35.861
I pull the covers off her.
She just stares at me.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.263
I look at her.
I look at him.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.032
He doesn't know what to say.
I walk out.

01:40.101 --> 01:43.402
So he is blowing me up
the whole way home.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.970
He texted me, like--
Nothing happened.

01:45.039 --> 01:48.040
He first texted me,
"Your assumptions

01:48.109 --> 01:49.775
are what's ruining us."

01:49.844 --> 01:51.977
I'm like,
"My assumptions?"
There's a girl in your bed.

01:52.046 --> 01:54.113
"What do you
expect me to assume?"

01:54.181 --> 01:56.548
And he goes, "Ugh, God.
I can't believe."

01:56.617 --> 01:58.350
Like, "Ugh!"
I'm like, "(bleep) talk!

01:58.419 --> 02:00.853
"I don't have time for this.
Tell me what you wanna tell me.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.221
"I'm not gonna sit here
and you be like,

02:02.289 --> 02:04.089
"'Babe, I'm so sorry.'
Like, say it now,

02:04.158 --> 02:05.457
or I'm gonna
hang up the phone."

02:05.526 --> 02:06.892
He tells me,
he goes,

02:06.961 --> 02:08.694
"There were two girls
in my bed.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.629
You didn't see the other girl
that was in the bathroom."

02:10.698 --> 02:13.632
What?!
"I was upstairs sleeping
with Max all night.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.801
I did not hook up
with them."

02:15.870 --> 02:17.970
Even if you're
telling the truth

02:18.038 --> 02:20.772
and you didn't cheat on me,
look how it looks.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.374
Look how stupid
I'm gonna look

02:22.443 --> 02:23.909
to everyone else
if I take you back.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.410
Everyone's gonna be
like, "Oh, honey."
Yeah.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.679
"He told you
he didn't cheat on you?"

02:27.748 --> 02:31.083
Yeah, but do you
really believe

02:31.152 --> 02:34.453
that he wouldn't have
hooked up with one of them?

02:34.522 --> 02:36.822
I did not see him
lay in the bed.

02:36.891 --> 02:39.958
It just looks terrible.
Yeah.

02:40.027 --> 02:41.493
Now he's calling me.
(cell phone ringing)

02:41.562 --> 02:43.495
Block his (bleep) number.
I just don't--

02:43.564 --> 02:46.231
I don't know what
I wanna do.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.534

03:43.357 --> 03:44.423
Oh, yeah?

03:56.036 --> 03:57.803
This makes me
super uncomfortable.

(Juliette)
We all knows Brandon's
girlfriend has a jealous streak,

04:00.975 --> 04:05.143
but when Madisson's involved,
she's probably right to worry.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.311

Yeah.

I'm sorry that, like, when we
were actually shooting it,

04:34.942 --> 04:36.642
Camilla was, like,
throwing some
jealous vibes out.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.911
I could tell that she was
a little jealous.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.180
We just been, like, like,
fighting a lot lately.

04:42.249 --> 04:45.150
Really?
Just over, like,
stuff like that.

04:45.219 --> 04:48.053
I know.
Well, Camilla wasn't
the only one who was jealous.

04:48.122 --> 04:51.823
Pshh, yeah.
Ben, like, kind of made
a big deal about it too.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.826
They seem that way.
He, like, freaked out.

04:54.895 --> 04:58.063
And he made it very clear
that he did not want me

04:58.132 --> 05:00.165
to do it, and he basically said,
like, "You can't do it.

05:00.234 --> 05:02.034
And, that, like...
That's not cool.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.302
That almost made it worse
'cause I was like,

05:03.370 --> 05:04.536
"Okay, now I'm going
to do it."

05:04.605 --> 05:06.271

when we were dating,

05:06.340 --> 05:08.307
I just remember, like,
you always would say
how you feel.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.709
I just really
appreciated that,
you know?
Yeah.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.678
It must be disappointing
for you to, like...

05:12.746 --> 05:14.746
It was.
...have Ben be that way.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.249
Big red flag?

05:17.318 --> 05:18.784
I don't know, Brandon.

05:18.852 --> 05:22.387
I don't have the best
track record with guys.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.324
Madisson, you know, like,
cheating on you was,

05:25.392 --> 05:28.894
like, my biggest mistake
of life.
I know.

able to get over our things

Can I live vicariously

06:05.532 --> 06:07.766
Are you gonna give me
something to live through?

06:07.835 --> 06:10.068
You know Ben.
First time I seen him

06:10.137 --> 06:13.038
since, like, last summer
was at BG's party.

06:13.107 --> 06:16.041
Madisson convinced me to fly
down here for the weekend.

06:16.110 --> 06:18.410
Does that mean you're
actually together
or does that just mean--

06:18.479 --> 06:21.813
No, we're not to--
Like, we're not, like,
together-together, no.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.682
Why are you asking?

06:23.751 --> 06:25.550
Why do you think?

06:25.619 --> 06:27.686
Um, uh, on that note.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.155
So ever since then, like,
me and him have always had

06:30.224 --> 06:32.624
kind of a flirty,
like, thing.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.159
Hi, it's you.
Right.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.828
He's definitely saying some
very scandalous things

06:36.897 --> 06:38.797
that makes me question
whether him and Madisson

06:38.866 --> 06:41.600
are in a real
relationship or not.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.869
I don't know, like,
I have some texts
I can show you.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.737
You can see
that's him saying,

06:45.806 --> 06:47.572
"Oh, hey, hottie.
Where'd you go?"

06:47.641 --> 06:50.008
Oh, "Pencil me in tomorrow."
Yeah, like, me-me-me--

06:50.077 --> 06:52.344
Pencil him in for what?
We've made plans.

06:52.413 --> 06:53.779
Where the (bleep)
is Madisson?
I know.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.113
And he wants
to hang out with me.

06:55.182 --> 06:58.683
Like, that's what
I don't understand.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.987
He sent me, like, Snapchats
of him basically naked.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.289
Like, sent me Snapchats of him
in the shower with a beer.

07:04.358 --> 07:06.725
Like, I've seen almost
everything except
for the business.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.428
Like, these are not
just, like, flirty.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.530
These are, like, sexual.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.598
That's "I'm not getting
what I want

07:13.667 --> 07:16.101
from this particular person,
at least not sexually."

07:16.170 --> 07:18.303
Madisson is wifey material.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.839
Like, leave her at home
with the four kids

07:20.908 --> 07:22.407

do you think
that I think?

17:58.445 --> 18:00.478
Well, no, honestly!

18:00.547 --> 18:03.347
Think about what I saw!

18:03.416 --> 18:06.084
What are you doing?
I swear on my--

18:06.152 --> 18:08.853
my whole entire family,
I didn't do a thing.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.388
Look at me.
(sobbing)

18:10.457 --> 18:15.560
I didn't do a thing.
I didn't do anything.

18:15.628 --> 18:20.198
I didn't do anything.
What were you thinking?

18:22.735 --> 18:26.471
I mean, listen.
Alex is a player.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.941
And you can't change
the player.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.509
You can change
the game though.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.711
Let me get
some popcorn.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.446
Have as much as you want.
We got a whole bag here.

18:35.515 --> 18:39.217
(sobbing)
I miss you so much.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.386
(continues sobbing)

18:48.128 --> 18:50.962
But... this is not okay.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.632
I don't want you
to leave me.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.778
Well, can we, like,
just hang out
a little bit?

19:07.847 --> 19:10.348
Like, I love you so much.
Okay, please let go of me.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.083
No.
Please.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.018
I'm not letting you go.

19:14.087 --> 19:17.021
No one knows you
like I do.

19:17.090 --> 19:18.022
You know me so well.

19:18.091 --> 19:19.724
Amanda, look at them.

19:22.595 --> 19:23.861
I'm not happy.
There's no--

19:23.930 --> 19:25.997
the only thing that's
making me happy is you.

19:26.065 --> 19:28.432
I just can't.
It's been a day.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.135
Like, it's been a day.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.804
I need so much time.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.007
Please.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.309
I gotta go.

19:38.378 --> 19:41.913
Don't leave, please.
Don't leave.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.188
That's so (bleep) up.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.290
(Alex)
Wow.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.525

It's been a while.

20:56.823 --> 21:00.124
We went boating yesterday.
It felt like a five-day trip,

21:00.193 --> 21:01.726
honestly,
with how much went on.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.095
Well, maybe I'm glad
I didn't go.
Oh, yeah.

21:04.163 --> 21:06.831
I was working.
How's work been with Tawni?

21:06.899 --> 21:08.733
Is it awkward or...?
It's not as awkward
as it was.

21:08.801 --> 21:11.335
Are you guys gonna
be able to be friends?

21:11.404 --> 21:16.774
I should put more energy
into this being
a relationship.

21:16.843 --> 21:20.011
What, like, me and you
being a relationship?
Yeah.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.846
I don't really date girls.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.615
It's getting back to normal.
Like, she's always gonna be
my friend.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.451
But it doesn't
make it very nice

21:27.520 --> 21:31.255
that she went straight
from me onto Ben.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.257
What do you mean?

21:36.296 --> 21:38.729
What?
So he came to the tiki bar,

21:38.798 --> 21:40.665
and they were, like,
hardcore flirting,

21:40.733 --> 21:42.967
and I seen some
text messages and--

21:43.036 --> 21:44.268
Like what?

21:44.337 --> 21:46.404
Sexting.
I need-- sexting?

21:46.472 --> 21:48.406
Like, sexting.
I have them.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.375
Let me see those.
Yeah, go for it.

21:51.444 --> 21:55.813
"LOL. Hey, hottie."
Heart eyes?

21:55.882 --> 21:57.315
What?

21:57.383 --> 21:59.116
They're, like,
making plans.

21:59.185 --> 22:02.053
Ben said,
"Pencil me in tomorrow."

22:02.121 --> 22:04.121
It's 2:30 in the morning.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.123
Booty-call hours.
Wow.

22:06.192 --> 22:08.292
Yeah.
That is insane.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.795
That's only
the text messages.

22:10.863 --> 22:12.530
You should see Snapchat.

22:12.598 --> 22:15.900
Oh, Benny-Ben,
Benny-Ben.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.768
Why is Tawni
playing with fire?

22:17.837 --> 22:22.006
Like, she knows that this
is going to piss off Madisson.

22:22.075 --> 22:23.274
Tawni likes to play
with fire,

22:23.343 --> 22:25.676
but Ben's the one
in a relationship.

22:25.745 --> 22:29.246
I have to tell Madisson.
But you also don't
wanna get too involved

22:29.315 --> 22:30.648
in something
that's not your business.

22:30.717 --> 22:34.618
Over my dead body
does Ben get away with this.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.657
♪ Oh, it's Saturday night ♪

22:39.726 --> 22:42.593
♪ I pray for the wicked
on the weekend ♪

22:42.662 --> 22:45.396
♪ Mama, can I get
another amen... ♪♪

22:45.465 --> 22:46.897
Are we drinking
tonight, Jared?

22:46.966 --> 22:48.599
Of course Jared's drinking.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.202
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
About to get my drink on.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.870
Shots?
Shots.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.472
On three.
Garrett.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.707
You got some alcohol therapy.
Dude, it's great.
Alcohol therapy?

22:56.776 --> 22:58.409
Is that a thing?
That's my favorite therapy.

22:58.478 --> 23:01.212
Yes, it is.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.980
So, Ben,
where's Madisson tonight?

23:03.049 --> 23:05.649
She doesn't feel like
coming out with all of us?

23:05.718 --> 23:08.352
Honestly, like, Madisson and I
recently have been kind of,

23:08.421 --> 23:10.020
I guess, rocky.
Yeah.

23:10.089 --> 23:13.157
Because she went and shot
this music video with Brandon.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.326
And I told her
I didn't like it,

23:15.395 --> 23:17.762
but she still went
and did it anyways, so...

23:19.699 --> 23:21.399
My opinion just seemed
to, like,

23:21.467 --> 23:23.334
not-not really matter
a whole lot, but--

23:23.403 --> 23:24.969
I'm sorry you felt
that way.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.837
Tomorrow's
another day, right?

23:30.743 --> 23:34.945
Well, hot damn diggity.
You look gorgeous.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.014
Aw, thanks, baby cakes.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.382
Do you like my new shoes?

23:38.451 --> 23:41.085
What kind of shoes
are those?
Valentino.

23:41.154 --> 23:42.319
Do you like them?

23:42.388 --> 23:43.654
I do like them.

23:43.723 --> 23:46.390
They go well
with the outfit.
Thank you.

23:46.459 --> 23:48.592
Very shiny.
(cell phone buzzing)

23:57.737 --> 24:00.371
So are you still, uh,
looking for a place in town?

24:00.440 --> 24:01.872
Are you planning on moving?
Yeah.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.608
Actually, the other day,
Chloe took me and Madisson over

24:04.677 --> 24:06.710
and we looked
at a couple of houses.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.579
Let's say maybe we should
get a shot to that.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.714
All right, let's get
some cherry bombs.
All right.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.583
Can I get
two cherry bombs?

24:15.087 --> 24:18.355
What's up?
Okay, so let me tell you
what Chloe just texted me.

24:18.424 --> 24:20.558
Oh, what is she saying?

24:20.626 --> 24:22.760
Shller
Of course you
can get the tour.

24:22.829 --> 24:24.762
Yeah, something like that.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.368
I mean, Chloe's always
trying to start drama
and like--

24:31.437 --> 24:33.270
I'm not gonna, like,
spy on him for her.

24:33.339 --> 24:34.939
It's just like,
it's awkward, and, like,

24:35.007 --> 24:36.774
he's my friend too.
It's weird.

24:38.544 --> 24:39.577
(laughing)

24:41.247 --> 24:42.880
What's going on?
Hi, hi.

24:42.949 --> 24:45.249
What's up?
So, uh...

24:45.318 --> 24:48.185
Chloe is actually trying
to spy on you right now.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.287
What do you mean?
No, not like--

24:50.356 --> 24:53.524
Not here, like,
personally, but...

24:53.593 --> 24:58.095
No, she was just texting me
and she asked me to watch Ben.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.431
I mean, obviously you're here,
like, hanging out with us.
Wait, what did she say?

25:00.500 --> 25:02.566
She was just like,
"Spy on Ben"?

25:02.635 --> 25:05.903
She literally said,
"Let me know if Ben is flirting
with any girls."

25:05.972 --> 25:10.474
That's stupid,
but I would expect
nothing less of her.

25:12.411 --> 25:15.312
She's just out
to ruin relationships.

25:15.381 --> 25:18.148
Better be a good boy.
Better be a good
boyfriend, right?

25:25.925 --> 25:27.057
Girls come over to the house

25:27.126 --> 25:28.225
and I was, like,
asleep in my room.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.693
Trying to be nice.

25:29.762 --> 25:32.162
I don't give a (bleep)
about you being nice.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.708
Thank you. Thank you.
Good job, you did great.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.177
You have a very
talented boyfriend.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.512
Thank you.
I know that.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.881
And you don't have a boyfriend?
No.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.385
I have my eyes on a few.
I'm not worried.

26:28.454 --> 26:29.987
I know what
my man wants.

26:31.991 --> 26:34.658
Hey, I'm gonna say what's up
to them real quick, all right?
Okay.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.293
All right.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.395
So...
So, so...

26:38.464 --> 26:39.863
How are you?
I'm good.
How are you?

26:39.932 --> 26:41.665
You guys been
hanging out a lot, right?

26:41.734 --> 26:43.334
Yeah, 'cause we vibe
well together.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.836
But it's kind of awkward
for me, you know what I mean?

26:45.905 --> 26:47.671
That's just how it is
in the industry,
and, like,

26:47.740 --> 26:50.374
he's gonna be performing
with so many different
other artists.

26:50.443 --> 26:51.809
You just have
to get used to it.

26:51.877 --> 26:55.312
I'm gonna try, I guess,
to keep my cool.

26:55.381 --> 26:57.514
I hope so. Yeah.
I know.
I hope so too.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.950
If you're not a threat.
Do I look like a threat?

27:00.019 --> 27:01.318
A little bit.

27:04.690 --> 27:06.490
You coming to his
Florida tour?

27:06.559 --> 27:08.425
No, actually, I'm not.
You going?

27:08.494 --> 27:10.027
Yeah, I'm performing.

27:10.096 --> 27:13.263
He never mentioned it,
so that's weird.
Oh, that is weird.

27:13.332 --> 27:14.765
Weird. Wild.
Yeah.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.700
I'm super excited about it.
Great.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.369
Well, I'm gonna talk
to him.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.477
(woman)
Here you go, guys.

27:26.545 --> 27:27.978
Wow, that looks great.
There you go.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.380
That's (bleep) awesome.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.384
It's balsamic.

27:33.452 --> 27:36.420
Thought it was,
like, chocolate.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.889
She's, like, not, like, just
a friend going on the tour.
She's, like, working
on the tour.

27:38.958 --> 27:41.091
I don't care. You hiding it from
me makes me think that, like,

27:41.160 --> 27:43.661
there's something going on.
That what?
Where we going with this?

27:43.729 --> 27:45.295
You just hid something from me
that I should've known.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.331
There's nothing to hide.
So you're thinking of it like--

27:47.400 --> 27:49.233
No, I know what I see
and I know, like,

27:49.301 --> 27:51.168
she was acting
all, like, catty to me.

27:51.237 --> 27:54.038
So that makes me feel
like she, like,
likes you or something.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.973
I'm not trying--
So you think I have
something with her?

27:56.042 --> 27:58.142
I don't know.
So you don't trust me,
is basically what you're saying.

27:58.210 --> 28:01.145
Let me know things before
I find out from someone
that I don't even know.

28:01.213 --> 28:03.714
You guys have fun on tour.
Yeah. Yeah.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.987
You know Tawni?
She's, like, texting me
at 2:00 in the morning,

28:10.056 --> 28:12.356
"Hey," like, "Are you up?"
like, "Come play,"

28:12.425 --> 28:13.691
like, "What are you doing?"

28:17.897 --> 28:22.132

when you don't try? ♪

28:22.201 --> 28:23.500

28:26.105 --> 28:28.539
What?

28:28.607 --> 28:31.642
Benji, this is amazing.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.610
(Juliette)
Madisson's and Ben's
relationship started

28:33.679 --> 28:37.181
going downhill basically
the moment they became official.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.917
Like, I want you here.
I do want you here.
Yeah.

28:39.985 --> 28:45.055
But I just don't want
the pressure of having me be
the only reason you're here.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.791
(Juliette)
And now that Ben's dirty secrets
are coming out,

28:47.860 --> 28:50.260
I wonder if it's already
too late for these two.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.362
I like this romantic side
of Benji.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.665
The romantic Benji?
Yeah.

28:54.734 --> 28:58.535
Also I wanted to, like,
apologize for how I reacted

28:58.604 --> 29:00.938
to the whole Brandon
music video thing.

29:01.006 --> 29:03.173
I didn't mean to, like,
get upset with you about it.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.609
I was just thrown off
and I don't know.
Yeah.

29:05.678 --> 29:08.712
But you know I trust you.
You know I have no reason
to not trust you.

29:08.781 --> 29:13.350
Well, it's nice to hear,
and thank you for apologizing.
Yeah.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.752
I have to tell you
something that's been,

29:14.820 --> 29:16.720
like, weirding me out.
What?

29:21.026 --> 29:24.328
So the other night, like,
Garrett texted me,

29:24.396 --> 29:27.831
and he was like,
"Yo, let's go get
some drinks."
Mm-hmm.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.167
So it ended up being, like,
a whole group of people.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.770
It was a good time,
but at the end
of the night,

29:32.838 --> 29:34.638
Garrett came up to me,
he was like, "Dude.

29:34.707 --> 29:37.508
You know that Chloe's been
texting Cara all night,"

29:37.576 --> 29:39.543
like, telling Cara
to spy on me,

29:39.612 --> 29:42.112
and, like, "If he does
anything bad, like,
take pictures

29:42.181 --> 29:44.381
so we can send 'em
to Madisson."
She didn't say why?

29:44.450 --> 29:46.650
Like, why she felt
the need to do that?

29:49.455 --> 29:52.489
You know Tawni,
Canvas's friend?
Yeah.

29:52.558 --> 29:56.160
We exchanged numbers
at Brandon's birthday party.

29:56.228 --> 29:59.463
I thought nothing of it,
you know, like, I'm just
meeting people in town.

29:59.532 --> 30:02.933
And then, like, she-- I--
Like, she's texting me
about like, "Hey.

30:03.002 --> 30:05.335
What are people doing today?
Are you guys going out?
Blah, blah, blah."

30:05.404 --> 30:07.037
But now it's starting
to get weird.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.373
Like, she's, like, texting me
at 2:00 in the morning now,

30:09.441 --> 30:12.309
"Hey," like, "Are you up?"
like, "Come play," like,
"What are you doing?

30:12.378 --> 30:13.844
What?
And I was like--

30:13.913 --> 30:15.646
Like, you know what
she's wanting.

30:15.714 --> 30:17.514
(Tawni)
You know who's still texting me?

30:17.583 --> 30:18.749
(Canvas)
Who?
(Tawni)
Ben.

30:18.818 --> 30:21.118
I literally have,
like, texts about him

30:21.187 --> 30:24.822
giving me the grand tour
of his new place.

30:24.890 --> 30:27.257
"Grand tour" to me
means the bedroom too.

30:27.326 --> 30:30.227
Oh! "Hey, hottie."

30:30.296 --> 30:33.096
He's bad.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.399
It's a little concerning
that this is the first time

30:35.467 --> 30:37.334
I'm even hearing
her name mentioned.

30:37.403 --> 30:40.404
I had no idea that it was--
that that was her intentions.

30:40.472 --> 30:43.674
I thought I was just, like,
meeting one of your friends,
you know?

30:43.742 --> 30:45.843
I don't know.
It would've been
nice to know

30:45.911 --> 30:48.545
that you guys were
just texting
even as friends,

30:48.614 --> 30:50.314
just so I was aware.

30:50.382 --> 30:53.684
Yeah, well, I mean,
it's nothing malicious.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.652
It's nothing like that.
Well, it sounds like it is.

30:55.721 --> 30:57.354
On her part, at least.
And on her-- I mean-- that--

30:57.423 --> 31:00.023
So it is?
I stopped texting once
it turned into that.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.759
How did she act in person
when you hung out with her
the other night?

31:02.828 --> 31:04.795
I've-I've only seen her
in person a few times.

31:04.864 --> 31:08.031
And how was she?
Forgettable.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.234
I wish I knew what him
and Madisson were,

31:10.302 --> 31:13.237
because obviously
he's pursuing me
and still talking to me

31:13.305 --> 31:14.738
and I'm still talking to him.
Constantly.

31:14.807 --> 31:16.807
So I'm gonna pursue him,
like, 100%.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.842
I don't think you should
feel threatened either.

31:18.911 --> 31:23.413
Don't worry about it.
She ain't got (bleep) on you.

31:23.482 --> 31:26.183
She doesn't seem
like much of a threat.

31:26.252 --> 31:28.552
I don't think
you have anything
to worry about, babe.

31:28.621 --> 31:30.854
She wants
that oil (bleep).

31:30.923 --> 31:32.289
Ben!

31:37.596 --> 31:40.864
There's no one else
in this world I'd rather
be around than you.

31:40.933 --> 31:45.535

Feels like a morgue out here.
Can we make some drinks?

32:01.954 --> 32:03.854
Are Alex and Juliette
not coming?

32:03.923 --> 32:07.557
Honestly, he feels like
the whole group has
kinda turned against him.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.259
Well, that sucks
that he feels attacked.

32:09.328 --> 32:12.262
Everybody comes on his boat
and uses him for a good time,

32:12.331 --> 32:14.998
but at the same time,
talks behind his back.

32:15.067 --> 32:18.602
I haven't been on his boat
in, like, eight months, so...

32:18.671 --> 32:20.103
I mean, well,
you know what?

32:20.172 --> 32:22.906
We've all been on his boat
at one time or another,

32:22.975 --> 32:25.676
numerous parties,
and I think we should

32:25.744 --> 32:29.346
just kind of just stay out
of Alex and Juliette's
relationship a little.

32:29.415 --> 32:34.418
We all know that Juliette went
to Alex's house and saw
a girl in his bed.

32:34.486 --> 32:35.819
Okay.
(chuckling)

32:35.888 --> 32:37.454
They don't want people
interfering in their (bleep),

32:37.523 --> 32:39.756
then we should just--
(Pauly Paul)
Stay out of it.

32:39.825 --> 32:40.891
Everyone needs
to just calm down.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.459
That's not what friends do.

32:42.528 --> 32:45.963
If you know something,
you tell them.
All right.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.864
But you agree that it
would suck to mess

32:47.933 --> 32:51.301
with someone's relationship
if it weren't true?
Yeah, but it's 100% true.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.203
If it's not true, though...
If it's not true,
it's horrible.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.838
...wouldn't it be wrong
to, like, go and say, like,

32:54.907 --> 32:57.240
"I think this is happening,"
if it's not true?

32:57.309 --> 32:59.109
Why are so aggressive?

32:59.178 --> 33:01.144
I'm just getting really tired--
The way you're aggressive
with me--

33:01.213 --> 33:04.281
Because you're aggressively
spying on me, Chloe.

33:04.350 --> 33:07.784
Texting my friends, saying,
"Hey, if you see Ben
out at a bar,

33:07.853 --> 33:10.721
send me photos of Ben talking
to girls so that I can
blackmail him."
I never said photos.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.222
Chloe, you're sitting here
trying to entrap me.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.124
No, I don't like
being attacked,
thank you.

33:14.193 --> 33:16.460
Well, I don't like
being spied on.
Okay, I'm sorry.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.428
Just seemed like the way it
came off that it's almost like

33:18.497 --> 33:20.397
you just kind of wanted him
to do something.

33:20.466 --> 33:22.099
You just, like, think that
I'm gonna do something wrong,

33:22.167 --> 33:24.968
but that's fine, because you
won't catch me slipping.

33:26.739 --> 33:28.138
(Ben)
Whatever.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.340
(Cara)
Chloe, will you take
a walk with me?

33:30.409 --> 33:32.342
Yeah.

33:35.247 --> 33:38.648
Okay, so what is happening?
With what?

33:38.717 --> 33:40.550
You're upset with me
because you think

33:40.619 --> 33:42.753
that I told Ben
what you texted me.

33:42.821 --> 33:44.121
Yeah.
Okay.

33:44.189 --> 33:46.089
So I didn't, like,
directly say anything

33:46.158 --> 33:47.924
to Ben, and I wouldn't
have done that,

33:47.993 --> 33:50.027
and, like, I didn't think
Garrett was going to,

33:50.095 --> 33:52.262
but, like, I'm not mad
at him for doing it.

33:52.331 --> 33:54.664
Like, they're friends.
You should be mad at him
for telling him that

33:54.733 --> 33:58.602
'cause it ruined my friendship
with Ben and my friendship
with Madisson.

33:58.670 --> 34:01.371
I tell him a lot of things.
Like, I tell him, like--

34:01.440 --> 34:03.373
Exactly, that's what I'm saying.
I've learned where

34:03.442 --> 34:05.742
your loyalty stands now,
so I won't say anything.

34:05.811 --> 34:08.545
That's not a loyalty thing.
Like, I trust him,
and I feel safe with him,

34:08.614 --> 34:09.946
so I tell him
a lot of (bleep).
Okay, well,

34:10.015 --> 34:11.815
and Garrett ran to Ben
and told him.

34:11.884 --> 34:13.250
So now I know not
to tell you anything

34:13.318 --> 34:15.585
that I don't want Garrett
to know, and that's fine.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.554

What you guys talking about?

34:17.623 --> 34:19.856

34:19.925 --> 34:21.892
It should've never
been told to you.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.361

be put in that position,

34:24.430 --> 34:26.997
the you trying to see,
like, what he's doing,
you know, it's not--

34:27.066 --> 34:31.535
Yeah, but Canvas told me
that Ben was, like,
Snapchatting Tawni.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.603
Like, he's being
sketchy.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.672

any of you are doing.

And you ruined
our relationship forever.

37:40.525 --> 37:43.393
You can trust me,
and I love you
more than anything,

37:43.462 --> 37:46.263
and I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.370
You suck.

37:55.207 --> 37:56.606
You're cute.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.478
I love you.
No, you don't.

38:01.546 --> 38:04.014
I do.
You just love me more
than you love

38:04.082 --> 38:05.882
other of your little
dog girlfriends.

38:05.951 --> 38:09.219
I care about you more than
any girl in this world,

38:09.288 --> 38:11.021
and I only wanna be
with you.

38:11.089 --> 38:13.189
(sighs)

38:13.258 --> 38:16.493
I'd like to look
at tonight as the step
in the right direction,

38:16.561 --> 38:21.364
because just the fact that,
like, being around you again
just feels so good,

38:21.433 --> 38:27.203
and there's no one else
in this world I'd rather
be around than you.

38:27.272 --> 38:29.239
(sighing)
Of course.

38:29.308 --> 38:32.175
I miss you.

38:32.244 --> 38:34.411
So we're back together?

38:37.749 --> 38:38.682
Mmm!
