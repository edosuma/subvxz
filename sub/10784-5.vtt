00:02.834 --> 00:03.834
Pacey: THE GUY
ON THE TAPE,

00:03.834 --> 00:06.333
THE GUY WITH
TAMARA JACOBS,

00:06.333 --> 00:07.667
THAT'S ME.

00:07.667 --> 00:08.834
NO.

00:10.417 --> 00:14.375
DO YOU PROMISE ME THAT
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE HONEST
AND UP-FRONT WITH ME?

00:14.375 --> 00:16.166
DON'T YOU THINK,
IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS,

00:16.166 --> 00:19.125
THAT THERE ARE THINGS
THAT PEOPLE JUST
DON'T WANT TO KNOW?

00:19.125 --> 00:21.000
I TOLD HIM
I WASN'T A VIRGIN.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.333
DAWSON, LOOK,
THERE'S YOUR MOM.

00:24.583 --> 00:26.166
YOU KNEW.

00:26.166 --> 00:27.875
HOW COULD YOU
NOT SAY ANYTHING?

00:27.875 --> 00:29.667
I WAS TRYING
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

00:29.667 --> 00:31.166
NO, JOEY.
YOU LIED TO ME!

00:38.291 --> 00:39.625
WHOA.

00:39.625 --> 00:42.083
WELL, SO MUCH
FOR TWISTER.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.083
WHAT'S NEXT?

00:43.083 --> 00:45.208
I VOTE FOR
THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE.

00:45.208 --> 00:47.708
YEAH, BUT TOWERING
INFERNO  HAS A HIGHER
ALL-STAR BODY COUNT.

00:47.708 --> 00:49.333
BUT THEY JUST BURNED.
IN THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE,

00:49.333 --> 00:50.750
THE DEATHS ARE MUCH MORE
INTERESTING.

00:50.750 --> 00:51.375
EVERYTHING'S UPSIDE DOWN.

00:51.375 --> 00:53.041
HEY, IT'S TIME.

00:53.041 --> 00:54.708
LET'S SEE
IF OUR DISASTER
MOVIE SÉANCE WORKED.

00:54.708 --> 00:56.125
GOOD EVENING
FROM THE WEATHER CENTER,

00:56.125 --> 00:58.667

00:58.667 --> 01:00.667

01:03.208 --> 01:04.708

01:04.708 --> 01:07.875
LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE
GONE AHEAD AND CANCELED
CLASSES FOR TOMORROW

01:07.875 --> 01:09.542

01:12.583 --> 01:14.500

01:14.500 --> 01:16.000
Gale: THANKS, HAL.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.208
WELL, BOB, SOUNDS LIKE
TOMORROW WOULD BE A GOOD DAY

01:18.208 --> 01:19.792
JUST TO STAY IN BED.

01:19.792 --> 01:21.000
YOU'VE GOT
THAT RIGHT, GALE.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.166
GOD! COULD THEY BE
ANY MORE OBVIOUS?

01:23.166 --> 01:25.250
SO, GALE, WHAT IS
YOUR VIEW ON THE CURRENT
SITUATION IN BOSNIA,

01:25.250 --> 01:28.125
AND WILL YOU BE
JUMPING MY BONES
AFTER THE BROADCAST?!

01:33.250 --> 01:34.667
DOES YOUR MOM
KNOW YOU KNOW?

01:34.667 --> 01:35.667
NO.

01:35.667 --> 01:37.834
YOUR DAD?

01:37.834 --> 01:39.208
PROFOUNDLY CLUELESS.

01:42.917 --> 01:46.250
SO...PAUL NEWMAN
OR GENE HACKMAN?

01:46.250 --> 01:48.083
UH, YOU KNOW, JOEY,
I'M A LITTLE TIRED.

01:48.083 --> 01:49.291
YOU MIND IF I SACK?

01:49.291 --> 01:52.333
UH...NO. THAT'S FINE.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

02:00.834 --> 02:04.583
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS,
DAWSON.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.708
UH, EVERYTHING'S
POSTPONED BECAUSE
OF THE HURRICANE.

02:07.708 --> 02:08.583
MY LIFE INCLUDED.

02:08.583 --> 02:10.625
YOUR LIFE IS
A HURRICANE.

02:10.625 --> 02:12.375
NO METAPHORS, JOEY.
IT'S TOO LATE.

02:15.375 --> 02:16.625
LATER.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.542
I'LL SEE YA TOMORROW,
JOEY.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.750
HEY, DAWSON?
YEAH?

02:21.750 --> 02:23.291
FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT.

02:23.291 --> 02:25.250
IT'S GONNA BE
A BUMPY LIFE.

02:31.125 --> 02:33.959
Gale: NOW IN OTHER NEWS,
WILLIAM BENNETT SAID TOM BURTON
WOULD CONFER WITH DEMOCRATS

02:33.959 --> 02:38.625
ON THE PANEL TODAY ABOUT
WHETHER THEY WOULD BE WILLING
TO JOIN GOP MEMBERS

02:38.625 --> 02:41.000
IN VOTING TO CONFER
IMMUNITY ON 3 WITNESSES.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.125
A 2/3 VOTE IS REQUIRED.

02:43.125 --> 02:44.625
BACK TO YOU, BOB.

04:00.875 --> 04:03.750
OH, WELL, I GUESS IF IT WERE
THE CAPESIDE BAKE-OFF,

04:03.750 --> 04:05.041
THEN I WOULD BE YOUR MAN.

04:05.041 --> 04:06.959
NO, I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE SARCASTIC.

04:06.959 --> 04:08.750
I'M TRYING
TO BE A REPORTER.

04:08.750 --> 04:12.583
FINE, JIM.
IF ANYBODY NEEDS ME,
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE,

04:12.583 --> 04:14.166
DARNING MY HUSBAND'S SOCKS.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.333
UNBELIEVABLE.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.666
I TAKE IT THEY'RE NOT LETTING
YOU COVER THE HURRICANE.

04:19.666 --> 04:22.208
OF COURSE NOT. I'M MISSING
A CERTAIN APPENDAGE
BETWEEN MY LEGS,

04:22.208 --> 04:23.166
WHICH APPARENTLY
MAKES ONE
UNIQUELY QUALIFIED

04:23.166 --> 04:25.500
TO COVER
INCLEMENT WEATHER.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.583
WELL, ME AND MY APPENDAGE
ARE BOTH THRILLED

04:26.583 --> 04:32.041
THAT YOU WILL BE HERE SAFE,
WHERE YOU BELONG.

04:32.041 --> 04:36.500
ALL RIGHT. FLASHLIGHTS,
CANDLES, COLD SHOWER,
AND BATTERIES.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.291
THANKS, DAWSON. LISTEN,
I'M GONNA RUN NEXT DOOR

04:39.291 --> 04:41.000
AND CHECK ON JEN

EXTEND AN INVITATION
TO RIDE OUT THE STORM.

04:42.625 --> 04:43.834
OK.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.917
MY DAD'S A GREAT GUY,
ISN'T HE?

04:51.917 --> 04:54.000
MAYBE ON THE TOM HANKS,
HARRISON FORD
IDEALISTIC SIDE,

04:54.000 --> 04:56.667
BUT SOLID LIKE A ROCK.

04:56.667 --> 04:58.125
WITHOUT QUESTION.

04:58.125 --> 04:59.625
AND FAITHFUL.

05:01.333 --> 05:03.542
EVEN TO A FAULT.

05:03.542 --> 05:05.792
MM-HMM.

05:05.792 --> 05:08.166
SO WHO'S COVERING,

05:18.375 --> 05:22.375
UM, HONEY, DID YOU
SECURE THE FRONT PORCH?

05:22.375 --> 05:23.333
I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.

05:23.333 --> 05:26.708
UM, GOTTA GET READY

05:45.583 --> 05:47.458
I JUST WANT IT KNOWN

05:47.458 --> 05:48.750
THAT I AM HERE
UNDER COMPLETE DURESS.

05:48.750 --> 05:50.166
OH, JUST STOP
YOUR PUNK-ASS WHINING.

05:50.166 --> 05:52.417
SCHOOL'S OUT TODAY.

05:52.417 --> 05:54.625
IT'S MY ONE CHANCE
TO SLEEP IN,

05:54.625 --> 05:56.500
CATCH UP ON MY SOAPS,
ENJOY THE STORM.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.166
HEY, DAD'S ORDERS.

05:58.166 --> 06:01.166
DAD'S ORDERS. YOU SAY THAT
WITH SUCH A LAPDOG ENTHUSIASM.

06:01.166 --> 06:02.583
YOU KNOW I'M GONNA
KICK YOUR ASS.

06:02.583 --> 06:04.291
[EFFEMINATE TONE]
OH, YOU'RE SO BUTCH, DOUGIE.

06:04.291 --> 06:06.166
OH...SCREW YOU.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.667
DOUG, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO LEARN HOW TO PROCESS

06:07.667 --> 06:08.667
THESE HOSTILE
OUTBURSTS OF RAGE.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.542
I MEAN, ANY THERAPIST
IS GONNA TELL YOU

06:10.542 --> 06:12.458
THAT THESE ARE JUST
MERE REPRESSION TACTICS

06:12.458 --> 06:15.333
TO MASK YOUR TRUE
HOMOSEXUAL DESIRES.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.750
JUST BECAUSE I'M PRETTY
DOESN'T MEAN I'M GAY.

06:17.750 --> 06:19.875
I HAPPEN TO BE
THE STRAIGHTEST GUY I KNOW.

06:19.875 --> 06:21.208
OH, REALLY?

06:21.208 --> 06:23.583
I THINK YOUR
CD COLLECTION WOULD
CONTRADICT THAT.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.792
BARBRA STREISAND,
THE SOUNDTRACK
TO LES MIZ...

06:26.792 --> 06:29.542
I HAVE AN INTERESTING
AND SOFT COMPLEXITY.

06:29.542 --> 06:32.166
YOU KNOW, DOUG,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DEFEND YOURSELF TO ME.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.625
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

06:33.625 --> 06:36.333
I JUST WANT YOU TO LIVE
A HAPPY AND, UH,
FRUITFUL LIFE.

06:36.333 --> 06:39.375
YOU KNOW, WOMEN HAPPEN
TO LOVE MY CD COLLECTION.

06:41.208 --> 06:42.708
ANSWER ME THIS.

06:42.708 --> 06:44.458
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE
A PROFESSION THAT
REQUIRES YOU TO DRESS

06:44.458 --> 06:46.458
LIKE ONE
OF THE VILLAGE PEOPLE?

06:46.458 --> 06:49.500
I CHOSE TO WEAR A BADGE
BECAUSE OUR FATHER,

06:49.500 --> 06:51.166
THE CHIEF OF POLICE
OF CAPESIDE,

06:51.166 --> 06:54.041
INSTILLED IN ME
A SENSE OF DUTY
AND A BELIEF IN JUSTICE.

06:54.041 --> 06:55.208
RIGHT, WHICH MAKES IT
ALL THE HARDER FOR YOU
TO COME OUT.

06:55.208 --> 06:57.667
I UNDERSTAND THAT, DOUG.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.959
YOU KNOW, I'M SURE THAT
THERE ARE SUPPORT GROUPS
FOR GAY OFFICERS.

06:59.959 --> 07:02.583
LISTEN, PACEY!
I'M NOT GAY!

07:07.750 --> 07:09.250
Bodie: YOU'RE WAFFLING.
WE ALREADY AGREED ON THIS.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.542
IT'S MUTILATION.

07:11.542 --> 07:14.750
STUDIES SHOW
THE TRAUMA OF HAVING
YOUR GENITALS SLICED

07:14.750 --> 07:16.792
CAN HAVE A LASTING
EFFECT INTO ADULTHOOD.

07:16.792 --> 07:19.417
TRUST ME. IF I WAS
CONSCIOUS OF IT,

07:19.417 --> 07:21.125
I'D MOST DEFINITELY
REMEMBER.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.583
YOU KNOW, JUNIOR'S FORESKIN
WILL BE A NON-ISSUE

07:23.583 --> 07:25.875
IF WE ALL BLOW AWAY
IN A TYPHOON.

07:25.875 --> 07:28.667
IT'S JUST A WARNING.
THESE THINGS NEVER
COME THIS FAR NORTH.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.375
WELL, I VOTE WE GO
TO DAWSON'S.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.792

DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
THIS KID--PFFT--IS BEING
CIRCUMCISED.

07:35.834 --> 07:36.875
NO...HE'S NOT.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.166
JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE PREGNANT,

07:38.166 --> 07:40.250
DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA
GET THE LAST WORD ON THIS.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.375
WATCH ME.

08:01.875 --> 08:05.291

IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, PACEY.

08:15.959 --> 08:18.959

TO HELP ME SECURE THE PLACE.

HOMEWORK COMING?

08:24.708 --> 08:27.542
I HOPE THIS BAD WEATHER'S
GIVING YOU A CHANCE
TO CATCH UP ON YOUR READING.

08:27.542 --> 08:30.834
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THE GUY'S A GOOF.

08:30.834 --> 08:33.250
HE HASN'T CRACKED A BOOK
SINCE THIRD GRADE.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.207

08:52.917 --> 08:56.166
I--I REALLY DON'T DO WELL
AT ALL IN BAD WEATHER.

08:56.166 --> 08:59.417

SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

MORE STORMS IN MY TIME
THAN YOU CAN COUNT.

HERE WITH US.

IF THE LORD DECIDES
TO BLOW MY HOUSE AWAY,
SO BE IT.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.250
OH, GRAMS,
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,

09:18.250 --> 09:19.583
THE LORD SENT A FAX
WHILE YOU WERE OUT.

09:19.583 --> 09:21.291
SOMETHING ABOUT
THE ARMAGEDDON.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.542

BACK IN THE HOSPITAL.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.208
I'M SORRY.
OH, YEAH.

09:32.208 --> 09:35.917

SOME TESTS. HE'LL BE OK.

KINDA ANXIOUS, THOUGH.

09:39.542 --> 09:40.000

09:53.333 --> 09:54.542
IT'S NOT A JUDGMENT
OR ANYTHING.

09:54.542 --> 09:55.959
IT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION.

DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

JUST AN OBSERVATION.

24:33.708 --> 24:35.959
WHICH DO YOU OBJECT
TO MORE, MRS. RYAN--

24:35.959 --> 24:38.417
THE FACT THAT I'M BLACK
AND SHE'S WHITE

24:38.417 --> 24:41.208
OR THAT WE'RE UNMARRIED AND
ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD IN SIN?

24:41.208 --> 24:42.542
WHAT I OBJECT TO
MOST, BODIE,

24:42.542 --> 24:45.667
IS WHEN CHILDREN
RAISE CHILDREN.

POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN ANYONE

25:53.583 --> 25:55.375
HOW WOULD I KNOW?

25:55.375 --> 25:55.834
OH, COME ON.

INTO CONSIDERATION

26:25.750 --> 26:28.542

FEET AND HAND SIZE,

I'D SAY HE'S SLIGHTLY
ABOVE AVERAGE.

THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

26:45.333 --> 26:47.792

NO, IT'S FINE. I'M...

INTO FANTASY SPECTACLES
OF SECURITY AND JOY.

FRANK CAPRA
AND STEVEN SPIELBERG

27:27.458 --> 27:29.917
ARE OFTEN COMPARED FOR
THEIR THEMATIC CONTENT.

27:29.917 --> 27:32.583
WHAT I LIKED MOST
ABOUT THOSE MOVIES

27:32.583 --> 27:36.959
IS THE FACT THAT NO MATTER
HOW FAR OFF THE PEDESTAL
THE CHARACTER FELL,

HE ALWAYS GOT
A SECOND CHANCE.

32:03.667 --> 32:06.542
I'M TAKING IT BACK.

32:06.542 --> 32:12.250
I DON'T WANT TO LOVE YOU
ANYMORE.

32:12.250 --> 32:14.333
I CHOOSE TO HATE YOU NOW.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.750
NO, MITCH, DON'T--

32:16.750 --> 32:18.792
IT'S ALREADY DONE.

32:18.792 --> 32:21.792
JUST LIKE THAT.

32:24.834 --> 32:27.834
SO I SUGGEST YOU
GET OUTTA THE CAR...

32:29.625 --> 32:32.291
BEFORE I PHYSICALLY
REMOVE YOU FROM IT.

LOCAL RESIDENTS TODAY.

32:57.125 --> 33:00.375

HAS TAKEN A SUDDEN DETOUR,

33:00.375 --> 33:03.792
AND IT'S LEFT ONLY
MODERATE DAMAGE TO CAPESIDE
AND ITS SURROUNDING AREAS.

33:03.792 --> 33:05.250
AND NOW THAT
THE STORM IS OVER,

33:05.250 --> 33:07.792
I GUESS IT'S TIME THAT
WE CAN ALL FINALLY SAY
GOOD-BYE

33:07.792 --> 33:09.250

BAD WEATHER.

33:13.542 --> 33:15.959

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

33:15.959 --> 33:17.625
IT'S BEEN A VERY
INTERESTING DAY.

33:17.625 --> 33:18.959
OH, ANYTIME.

33:18.959 --> 33:21.250
UH, SORRY ABOUT
THE GUNPLAY.

33:21.250 --> 33:22.500

HONEST WITH YOU, DOUG.

33:29.166 --> 33:31.959
I'M SEEING SOMEONE
RIGHT NOW.

33:31.959 --> 33:34.458
OH. WELL,
FAIR ENOUGH.

33:34.458 --> 33:36.750
OK.

33:36.750 --> 33:37.792
LET'S GO, SQUIRT.

33:37.792 --> 33:40.208

34:15.041 --> 34:16.083
BUT BEFORE I GO,
THERE ARE
A FEW THINGS--

34:16.083 --> 34:18.708
OK, LOOK, JEN--
NO. HEAR ME OUT,

34:18.708 --> 34:20.417
DAWSON, PLEASE, OK?

34:20.417 --> 34:22.333
BECAUSE THIS SEEMS TO
BE THE DAY OF TRUTHS,

34:22.333 --> 34:24.417
AND I'M TAKING MY TURN.

34:24.417 --> 34:25.542
[SOB]

34:25.542 --> 34:27.291
I LOST MY VIRGINITY...

34:28.625 --> 34:32.291
WHEN I WAS 12
TO SOME OLDER GUY
WHO GOT ME DRUNK.

34:32.291 --> 34:34.041
I DON'T REALLY
REMEMBER HIS NAME,

34:34.041 --> 34:35.458
BUT AFTER THE FIRST
PREGNANCY SCARE,

34:35.458 --> 34:38.875
I WENT ON THE PILL,
AND I USED CONDOMS...

34:38.875 --> 34:43.417
MOST OF THE TIME...
SOME OF THE TIMES.

34:43.417 --> 34:44.458
UM...

34:44.458 --> 34:47.125
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S KINDA BLURRY.

34:47.125 --> 34:49.083
I WAS REALLY--
I WAS REALLY
DRINKING A LOT

34:49.083 --> 34:50.750
AND HAVING BLACKOUTS
AND STUFF AND...

34:50.750 --> 34:52.583
[SNIFFLES]

34:52.583 --> 34:55.083
[SIGHS]

34:55.083 --> 35:00.041
I WAS SEXUALIZED
WAY TOO YOUNG,

35:00.041 --> 35:02.083
AND I DON'T WISH THAT
ON ANYBODY.

35:02.083 --> 35:04.625
I MEAN, SEX
AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE

35:04.625 --> 35:07.667
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT
IS A BAD IDEA.

35:09.125 --> 35:12.041
I FINALLY GOT CAUGHT
HAVING SEX IN
MY PARENTS' BED.

35:12.041 --> 35:14.917
DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL...

35:14.917 --> 35:17.417
FORNICATING RIGHT BEFORE
HIS VERY EYES.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.708
HE STILL CAN'T LOOK ME
IN THE FACE,

35:21.708 --> 35:23.000
BUT THEN AGAIN
HE SHIPPED ME
200 MILES AWAY

35:23.000 --> 35:25.417
SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO.

35:25.417 --> 35:29.083
BUT, DAWSON, I'M NOT
THAT GIRL ANYMORE.
I NEVER REALLY WAS.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.250
AND I'M NOT THAT
WHITE-AS-SNOW IMAGE
YOU'VE GOT, EITHER.

35:31.250 --> 35:32.583
I'M SOMEWHERE
IN-BETWEEN,

35:32.583 --> 35:36.333
AND I'M JUST--
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

35:36.333 --> 35:40.583
JEN, Y-YOU DON'T NEED--
IT'S NOT...IT'S NOT YOU, OK?

35:40.583 --> 35:42.250
IT'S MY OWN
STUPID HANGUPS.

35:43.583 --> 35:44.917
MY PARENTS HAVE
THIS RAGING SEX LIFE,

35:44.917 --> 35:49.291
AND I GUESS I SECRETLY
USED IT AS A MEASURE
OF HAPPINESS.

35:49.291 --> 35:51.667
WELL, SEX DOESN'T
EQUAL HAPPINESS.

35:51.667 --> 35:53.708
JEN, I KNOW.

35:53.708 --> 35:55.250
I KNOW THAT NOW.

35:56.417 --> 35:59.083
I'M SORRY ABOUT
LYING TO YOU.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.583
BUT I CAN'T APOLOGIZE
FOR MY PAST.

36:02.583 --> 36:03.959
I MEAN,
I'VE LEARNED FROM IT.

36:03.959 --> 36:06.667
I'M A BETTER PERSON.
IT'S GOTTEN ME HERE.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.500
AND THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO START OVER.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.166
THIS IS MY CHANCE.

36:13.166 --> 36:16.917
AND IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE
IF YOU'D BE A PART OF THAT.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.375
ON ONE CONDITION...

36:21.917 --> 36:25.875
THAT YOU'LL HAVE ME.

36:25.875 --> 36:29.333
BECAUSE, JEN, MY BEHAVIOR
HAS BEEN UNREDEEMABLE...

36:29.333 --> 36:32.667
AND I DON'T DESERVE
SOMEONE AS...

36:32.667 --> 36:36.542
PASSIONATE AND OPEN
AND HONEST AND BEAUTIFUL
AS YOU ARE.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.125

36:46.125 --> 36:47.625
[SNIFFLE] MM-HMM.

36:58.542 --> 37:00.542
OHH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER?

37:00.542 --> 37:02.000
OH, I CIRCLED BACK.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.291
IT'S LATE, PACEY.

37:04.291 --> 37:06.125
I JUST HAD ONE MORE
IF QUESTION.

37:06.125 --> 37:07.458
HERE, I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

37:07.458 --> 37:12.708
IF YOU COULD DO ANY ONE THING
IN YOUR LIFE AGAIN,

37:12.708 --> 37:14.375
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

37:14.375 --> 37:17.583
WELL, I WOULDN'T HAVE
MARRIED AN ABUSIVE,
FAT STOCKBROKER.

37:19.333 --> 37:20.959
SAME QUESTION,
BACK AT YA.

37:20.959 --> 37:23.834
WELL, I'D BE OLDER...

37:23.834 --> 37:26.375
SO I COULD TELL THE WORLD
ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL WOMAN

37:26.375 --> 37:28.417
WHO I AM RAPIDLY
FALLING IN LOVE WITH.

37:30.625 --> 37:33.166
DID YOU REALLY THINK
THAT IT WAS GOING
TO MAKE ME JEALOUS

37:33.166 --> 37:35.750
BY FLIRTING
WITH DEPUTY DOUG?

37:35.750 --> 37:37.834

I DON'T FLIRT.

37:38.417 --> 37:40.750
BECAUSE IF YOU DID,

37:40.750 --> 37:42.458
IT'S EXCEEDINGLY
UNNECESSARY.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.041
I'M ALREADY JEALOUS OF
EVERY GUY WHO'S EVER BEEN
IN YOUR FIELD OF VISION...

37:52.917 --> 37:55.917
WHO'S KNOWN
THE SMELL OF YOUR HAIR...

37:55.917 --> 37:58.250
WHO'S HELD YOUR BODY
AGAINST HIS.

37:59.166 --> 38:02.417
WE'RE GETTING SLOPPY, PACEY.

38:02.417 --> 38:05.792
YOU KNOW WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO END THIS.
IT'S GETTING TOO DANGEROUS.

38:05.792 --> 38:07.166
UHH! BUT...

38:07.166 --> 38:09.667
TELL ME THAT ISN'T
A TURN-ON.

38:09.667 --> 38:11.041
OH, PACEY.

38:11.041 --> 38:12.291
WAIT, I--

38:12.291 --> 38:14.000
JUST ONE MORE
QUESTION.

38:15.542 --> 38:16.959
[EXHALES]

38:16.959 --> 38:20.667
IF YOU COULD DO ANY
ONE THING RIGHT NOW...

38:20.667 --> 38:22.333
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

39:13.542 --> 39:14.917

39:23.667 --> 39:25.500
SO WHY'D YOU DO IT?

39:29.291 --> 39:33.125

BECAUSE IF YOU THINK
IT CAN'T GET WORSE, IT CAN.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.291

39:36.291 --> 39:38.708

39:38.708 --> 39:41.417
NO. I WOKE UP
ONE DAY, MITCH,

39:41.417 --> 39:45.083
AND I REALIZED
MY LIFE WAS PERFECT.

39:45.083 --> 39:50.667
EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED
FROM THE TIME I WAS 6
HAD BEEN REALIZED.

39:52.875 --> 39:54.959
I DISCOVERED...

39:54.959 --> 39:58.041
PERFECTION OBTAINED IS
A DISCOMFORTING STATE.

39:58.041 --> 40:00.875
AND I GOT RESTLESS.

40:02.250 --> 40:05.083

40:05.083 --> 40:09.041

IS JUST THE WAY YOU'VE
ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE?

AND I GUESS THAT LEFT ME
FEELING EMPTY--NOT WANTING.

40:32.041 --> 40:34.542
AND I JUST WANTED
TO WANT AGAIN.

40:38.417 --> 40:40.875
SO...I SET OUT
TO ACHIEVE IT.

40:40.875 --> 40:42.542
AND, BOY,
DID I SUCCEED.

40:46.291 --> 40:47.708
