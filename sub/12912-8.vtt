<i>* In this world *</i>

00:05.300 --> 00:06.460
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

00:06.540 --> 00:10.380
<i>* You know I love</i>

00:10.460 --> 00:12.580

00:12.660 --> 00:17.020

00:18.660 --> 00:20.460

00:20.540 --> 00:21.860

00:21.940 --> 00:23.660

00:37.820 --> 00:38.940

00:44.860 --> 00:48.420
<i>* I just wanna be... *</i>

00:49.500 --> 00:53.260
Tonight, under the full moon,
we will defeat the dragon.

00:53.340 --> 00:57.020
With the force of 150 moon rings,
I have no doubt we will succeed.

00:57.580 --> 00:58.900
You really believe that?
- Weilan.

00:58.980 --> 01:00.300
Let her speak.

01:00.940 --> 01:03.260
The Eastern Pod threw all
their moon ring power

01:03.340 --> 01:05.340
at the dragon and
still couldn't stop it.

01:05.420 --> 01:06.980
I'm sorry for what happened,
Weilan.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.140
But we are a strong,
disciplined pod.

01:10.220 --> 01:11.540
We're prepared to
face the dragon.

01:11.620 --> 01:14.780
That dragon is going down,
and I can't wait to see it.

01:14.860 --> 01:18.060
Your courage is a great asset
to the pod, Ondina.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.180
Which is why
you will not be with us tonight.

01:20.260 --> 01:21.260
Excuse me?

01:21.340 --> 01:24.260
You and Mimmi have
a more important role to play.

01:24.340 --> 01:26.220
You'll watch the little
ones in the caves.

01:27.460 --> 01:28.820
You want us to babysit?

01:29.540 --> 01:32.780
Any mermaid can look after hatchlings
and tell them bedtime stories.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.020
Ondina's right.

01:34.100 --> 01:36.460
The pod needs the best
and the strongest up front.

01:36.540 --> 01:40.020
This task is too important to
entrust to just any mermaid.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.180
Veridia, please--

01:41.260 --> 01:42.620
I will see you when it is over.

01:51.700 --> 01:54.380
Babysitting.
I can't believe this!

01:55.300 --> 01:57.700
Ondina,
if the elders fail tonight,

01:57.780 --> 02:00.940
you and Mimmi will have
a great responsibility.

02:01.020 --> 02:03.540
The young will need strong
leaders to guide them.

02:03.620 --> 02:05.540
That's why Veridia chose you.

02:06.580 --> 02:08.020
The pod will not fail.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.300
The sea is so peaceful.

02:17.340 --> 02:19.820
I hope it's still that way
after the full moon tonight.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.660
I'm sure the pod will deal
with the dragon.

02:22.820 --> 02:25.500
I know I'm only a...
a part-time mermaid...

02:26.340 --> 02:27.700
but I feel like I should help.

02:27.780 --> 02:31.460
You need to stay on land
tonight, with me, okay?

02:31.540 --> 02:34.620
We're going to have a quiet night
watching movies and eating pizza.

02:37.180 --> 02:39.460
Aren't you worried about
Mimmi out there with that thing?

02:40.020 --> 02:41.460
Of course.

02:41.540 --> 02:44.580
But Mimmi says Veridia has a
plan, and the pod are experts.

02:44.660 --> 02:46.020
Let's just leave it to them.

02:54.380 --> 02:56.140
There you go. Enjoy.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.660
How much cheese
did you put on that toastie?

02:59.740 --> 03:01.860
Three slices.
Makes it really yummy.

03:01.940 --> 03:04.300
Every cheese slice costs us.

03:04.380 --> 03:05.380
You need to cut back.

03:06.340 --> 03:09.220
Good idea. In fact,
why bother with cheese at all?

03:10.140 --> 03:12.060
There is a market for
dairy-free toasties.

03:13.060 --> 03:18.340
While we're at it, why not just cut
out the tomato... and the bread?

03:20.140 --> 03:23.180
I'm being serious. It's all
about finding efficiencies.

03:24.660 --> 03:26.740
What are you even doing here,
Cam?

03:26.820 --> 03:29.260
Shouldn't you be
out saving lives?

03:29.340 --> 03:31.460
I'm the co-owner, remember?

03:31.540 --> 03:32.940
How could I forget?

03:33.020 --> 03:35.820
We all need to do our bit to keep
costs down. That's all I'm saying.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.060
That'll be $7.50.

03:37.900 --> 03:38.900
What?

03:38.980 --> 03:41.620
"We all need to do our bit
to keep costs down"?

03:42.500 --> 03:43.940
You can't charge me,
I'm the manager.

03:44.020 --> 03:45.260
Not right now. You're off-duty,

03:45.340 --> 03:48.740
and I'm acting manager so,
that'll be $7.50.

03:55.820 --> 03:56.900
Keep the change.

03:56.980 --> 04:01.260
You're cute when you get all huffy.
Don't forget, date night tonight.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.420
There is not a lot of room
for the dragon in here.

04:18.500 --> 04:22.340
Exactly. Once you lure it in,
it has nowhere to go.

04:24.380 --> 04:26.500
You turn the dragon's power
back on it and--

04:26.580 --> 04:27.820
No more dragon.

04:27.900 --> 04:28.940
We hope.

04:30.420 --> 04:32.540
You scared?
- No.

04:35.380 --> 04:36.980
Yes.

04:37.060 --> 04:40.300
Zac... I know you can do this.

04:41.660 --> 04:43.380
But I wouldn't blame you
if you backed out.

04:43.460 --> 04:46.020
I won't.
-Good.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.860
Because the mermaid council think
that moon rings can save them.

04:49.780 --> 04:50.900
They're wrong.

04:52.580 --> 04:54.780
Speaking of the pod, how do
we keep them out of the way?

04:54.860 --> 04:56.380
I'll take care of that.

04:57.820 --> 04:59.180
What about Evie?

04:59.820 --> 05:02.860
Don't worry. I have a
plan to keep her occupied.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.460
We can't afford any risks, Zac.

05:06.540 --> 05:11.660
This is my girlfriend we're talking about.
I would do anything to keep her safe.

05:13.060 --> 05:16.540
Well, whatever your plan is,
it better work.

05:33.940 --> 05:35.460
Great view.

05:35.540 --> 05:36.660
Yeah.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.820
Are you guys okay?

05:42.100 --> 05:43.460
Yeah.
-Fine.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.700
Okay, spill. What's wrong?

05:47.780 --> 05:50.780
Veridia doesn't want us
to fight the dragon.

05:50.860 --> 05:54.020
She's got us minding the little
mermaids in the caves underneath Mako.

05:54.100 --> 05:57.060
We can't help the pod by hiding in
the caves like frightened squid.

05:58.020 --> 06:00.980
If we aren't included,
it's like everything we ever did

06:01.060 --> 06:03.340
in the past to save
Mako was for nothing.

06:03.420 --> 06:04.900
I agree. Let's fight.

06:04.980 --> 06:06.100
Yeah, well you would say that.

06:07.140 --> 06:08.460
Wait. What?

06:09.140 --> 06:10.780
It's our pod.

06:10.860 --> 06:12.060
We need to fight for it.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.380
You're going to disobey Veridia?

06:15.460 --> 06:16.900
We've done it before.

06:19.140 --> 06:20.140
Count me in.

06:22.060 --> 06:24.220
Veridia gave me a moon ring.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.740
This is my fight too.

06:32.460 --> 06:35.060
When I was young,
in the last days of my pod,

06:35.140 --> 06:36.500
I was taught a proverb.

06:37.620 --> 06:42.100
When the dragon birth by moonlight
rises, wait in the shadows...

06:43.100 --> 06:46.700
for to defeat the darkness,
from the darkness you must come.

06:48.380 --> 06:52.460
"Wait in the shadows..."
the western side of the island.

06:54.300 --> 06:57.340
If you hide in the shadow of
Mako, when the dragon appears--

06:57.420 --> 06:59.980
We can take it by surprise.
We'll have the advantage.

07:02.540 --> 07:06.340
Thank you, Weilan. You have
done the pod a great service.

07:18.220 --> 07:21.260
Sorry, mate. I'm already booked.

07:21.340 --> 07:24.340
Me and Carly are taking the
tinny out for a moonlight picnic.

07:24.420 --> 07:25.620
Cancel.

07:27.140 --> 07:29.740
Are you nuts?
She'll skin me alive.

07:30.260 --> 07:32.500
I really need this, Cam.
I wouldn't ask otherwise.

07:33.460 --> 07:35.140
Please?

07:35.220 --> 07:36.900
Okay. What do you want me to do?

07:36.980 --> 07:38.940
Be at my place at 7:00.
Bring Evie a pizza.

07:39.020 --> 07:40.620
Just tell her I've been held up.

07:41.660 --> 07:42.820
Keep her company
till I get there.

07:42.900 --> 07:43.940
How late will you be?

07:45.420 --> 07:46.540
One movie.

07:48.380 --> 07:49.700
Maybe two.

07:49.780 --> 07:51.220
Two chick flicks. Great.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.460
Just make sure she
stays in the bungalow,

07:52.540 --> 07:55.260
that's your number one priority.
-This is about the full moon, isn't it?

07:55.340 --> 07:58.060
I'll give you the lowdown later, but
right now I need you to trust me.

07:58.980 --> 08:00.580
Do not let Evie
out of your sight.

08:04.940 --> 08:08.340
Well,
Carly's not going to be happy.

08:08.420 --> 08:11.300
The pod will meet off Mako
just before sundown.

08:11.380 --> 08:13.020
We should get there
as late as possible

08:13.100 --> 08:15.260
so Veridia won't have time
to send us away.

08:15.340 --> 08:16.340
Okay.

08:16.420 --> 08:19.260
I'll close up the shop, say goodbye to
Dad and I'll meet you in the grotto.

08:19.340 --> 08:21.020
Have you told Zac
what you're doing?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.300
Are you kidding?

08:22.380 --> 08:24.500
If he knew, he'd do everything
he could to stop me.

08:25.820 --> 08:27.140
So how are you
going to handle him?

08:31.620 --> 08:32.740
Leave it to me.

08:37.820 --> 08:39.179
Hi, Carly.
-Hey, Evie.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.780
Busy day?
-Kind of.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.980
I have a favor to ask.
-Sure. What is it?

08:44.500 --> 08:46.620
Zac's expecting me
at the bungalow at 7:00.

08:47.380 --> 08:48.540
But I'm not going.

08:48.620 --> 08:51.660
All you have to do is show up
with a large seafood supreme,

08:51.740 --> 08:54.260
tell him I'm busy with a shop
delivery, and that I'll be late.

08:54.340 --> 08:55.460
Don't let him leave.

08:55.540 --> 08:57.180
Sorry, Evie.
Cam and I have a date.

08:57.260 --> 08:59.340
It's been planned for weeks.

08:59.420 --> 09:01.740
You know I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't so important.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.140
Well, this is important, too.

09:04.660 --> 09:07.340
Carly, this is really,
really important.

09:07.860 --> 09:11.820
What is?
-Trust me. Please.

09:17.980 --> 09:21.460
Some kind of major mer-business
is about to go down, right?

09:22.260 --> 09:24.620
I wish I could tell you, but--
-No dice.

09:26.460 --> 09:30.220
I'm your best friend. You want
my help, it's full disclosure.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.780
Carly--
-Trust for trust.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.260
I'm going to join the
pod off Mako tonight

09:40.340 --> 09:45.860
to fight a 60-foot, magic water dragon
whose sole purpose is to destroy mermaids.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.100
Satisfied?

09:49.180 --> 09:51.340
Why didn't you just say so?

09:55.700 --> 09:58.740
Thanks. Finished work early?

09:58.820 --> 10:00.540
Slow afternoon.
David's got it covered.

10:00.620 --> 10:01.780
Right.

10:03.420 --> 10:05.100
About tonight--
-Tonight's off.

10:07.380 --> 10:08.420
You're canceling our date?

10:08.500 --> 10:10.180
Yeah. I'm really sorry.

10:10.260 --> 10:12.860
That's fine. Things happen.

10:13.820 --> 10:15.460
So you're not upset?
-No.

10:15.540 --> 10:18.020
In fact, I was going to cancel, too.
-Really?

10:18.900 --> 10:20.020
Yeah.

10:20.940 --> 10:22.540
Did you get a better
offer or something?

10:22.620 --> 10:24.100
What? Of course not.

10:24.180 --> 10:25.860
No, I... Wait.

10:26.940 --> 10:28.540
What's more important
than hanging out with me?

10:28.620 --> 10:31.140
What's more important
than hanging out with me?

10:31.900 --> 10:32.940
Nothing.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.820
Right then, see you tomorrow.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.220
Okay then.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.860
Camster's off the hook.

10:46.620 --> 10:49.620
The pod will be on the west side
of Mako, well out of the way.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.700
How do you know the dragon's
coming from the east?

10:53.780 --> 10:55.180
That's where the moon rises.

11:15.980 --> 11:17.580
You know I'd come
with you if I could.

11:17.660 --> 11:21.660
You've done enough.
Now it's my turn.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.580
The dragon's not going to know
what hit it.

11:48.060 --> 11:51.060
It's getting late.
We can't wait any longer.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.460
Evie said she would be here.

11:52.540 --> 11:53.860
She knows where we're going.

11:53.940 --> 11:55.340
Oh, what about Weilan?

11:55.420 --> 11:57.220
Without a moon ring,
she's no use.

12:04.940 --> 12:07.220
Hey, Evie.
-What were you and Zac doing?

12:07.860 --> 12:10.140
What?
-I saw you with him.

12:10.780 --> 12:12.180
Where's he going?

12:12.260 --> 12:14.180
He's... going for a swim.

12:14.260 --> 12:16.180
He's supposed to meet
me at the bungalow.

12:17.260 --> 12:18.420
Then go wait for him.

12:18.500 --> 12:19.700
I think you two are
cooking something up.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.780
We're not. Really.

12:22.540 --> 12:24.660
Does it have to do with what you
and Zac were doing on Mako?

12:24.740 --> 12:26.740
No. Just leave it, okay?

12:39.580 --> 12:41.660
You need to tell me
what is going on!

12:47.940 --> 12:49.620
It doesn't matter now anyway.

12:50.700 --> 12:52.340
What doesn't matter?

12:53.980 --> 12:55.820
Where has Zac gone?

12:58.020 --> 13:00.100
He's going after the dragon...
isn't he?

13:01.380 --> 13:03.100
The pod said that
they could destroy it!

13:03.180 --> 13:05.380
The pod's plan won't work!

13:05.460 --> 13:06.740
And you think you can do better?

13:06.820 --> 13:09.980
Zac's a merman,
that gives him an edge.

13:10.060 --> 13:12.060
He's going to turn the dragon's
power back on it.

13:12.140 --> 13:13.420
How?

13:13.500 --> 13:15.620
The eastern magic
I was teaching him on Mako.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.380
Is he going to fight
the dragon on Mako?

13:17.460 --> 13:18.740
Not on the island.

13:18.820 --> 13:20.220
Then where?

13:22.100 --> 13:24.220
The moon pool.

13:24.940 --> 13:26.220
Don't interfere, Evie!

13:26.300 --> 13:28.700
Zac may be our only hope!

13:28.780 --> 13:30.220
Evie!

13:52.140 --> 13:54.580
We have never faced
a threat like this...

13:55.500 --> 13:58.460
but our strength
is in our unity.

13:59.460 --> 14:03.140
Trust in that, and I have
no doubt we will prevail.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.220
I told you to look
after the hatchlings.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.900
They're being taken care of.

14:08.980 --> 14:11.820
Right now, the pod needs
every available moon ring.

14:11.900 --> 14:14.020
And that means that you need us.

14:15.260 --> 14:16.460
Prepare yourselves.

14:31.660 --> 14:32.780
Zac?

14:37.300 --> 14:38.420
Evie?

14:45.580 --> 14:47.020
Hello, Zac?

14:49.260 --> 14:51.580
What are you doing here?
-Likewise.

14:51.660 --> 14:52.940
I asked you first.

14:54.580 --> 15:00.060
Zac's meeting Evie but he got, uh, held
up helping his dad... move a piano.

15:00.980 --> 15:03.820
So he asked me to drop a pizza
off and keep Evie company.

15:06.020 --> 15:08.580
So,
you ditched me to move a piano?

15:09.820 --> 15:13.220
I was helping a friend.
Any idea where Evie is?

15:14.780 --> 15:18.540
Uh, Evie got stuck
with a late delivery,

15:18.620 --> 15:23.420
so... she asked me to, um, keep
Zac company until she got here.

15:25.860 --> 15:28.180
It's quite a coincidence
them both being late.

15:29.380 --> 15:31.180
Yeah. Weird, huh?

15:38.980 --> 15:41.660
Evie's not coming, is she?
She asked you to cover for her.

15:42.580 --> 15:46.260
A girl never betrays
her best friend's confidence.

15:46.340 --> 15:49.260
What about Zac? You're
fronting for him, aren't you?

15:49.340 --> 15:51.700
I resent the implication.

15:54.140 --> 15:55.940
So are we just going to let
these pizzas go cold?

17:13.940 --> 17:15.260
Evie should be here by now.

17:15.339 --> 17:17.420
Get your mind in the game,
Mimmi.

17:20.420 --> 17:21.740
Veridia?

17:22.859 --> 17:26.099
The moon has risen.
Why are we waiting here?

17:26.180 --> 17:29.260
By waiting in the shadows of Mako
we'll have the element of surprise.

17:30.140 --> 17:31.300
How do you know that?

17:31.380 --> 17:32.820
Weilan told me.

17:35.580 --> 17:36.820
Weilan?

17:56.420 --> 17:57.620
Evie, what are you doing here?

17:57.700 --> 17:58.940
You can't do this, Zac.

17:59.020 --> 18:00.340
You need to leave, now!

18:03.220 --> 18:05.180
What was that?

18:05.260 --> 18:06.540
The dragon.

18:16.140 --> 18:18.940
Oh... it's coming.
Get behind me!

18:33.500 --> 18:35.580
Zac!
-What?

18:36.380 --> 18:38.580
He's with the dragon,
in the moon pool.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.660
Weilan sent us here
so Zac could fight it.

18:47.180 --> 18:49.060
Come on lizard breath, hit me!

19:00.660 --> 19:02.060
You can do better than that!

19:12.580 --> 19:13.740
Leave him alone!

19:14.300 --> 19:15.300
Evie!

19:28.580 --> 19:31.020
Evie? Talk to me, Evie!

19:57.380 --> 19:59.700
Evie? Wake up, please.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.180
Evie? Talk to me, please.

20:02.260 --> 20:03.700
Evie.
-Zac.

20:03.780 --> 20:05.460
What happened?

20:05.540 --> 20:07.420
Where's the dragon?

20:07.500 --> 20:09.740
It's okay. It's gone.

20:18.380 --> 20:19.420
Evie?

20:26.540 --> 20:27.580
My tail!

20:44.140 --> 20:45.420
I'm not a mermaid anymore.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.100
At least you're not hurt.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.060
And the pod is safe.

20:54.100 --> 20:55.220
It could have been much worse.

20:58.260 --> 20:59.700
She's lost her tail.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.060
How could it be worse?

21:04.060 --> 21:06.020
I need to go home.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.100
I'll walk you.

21:24.420 --> 21:26.220
Nice work, Weilan.

21:26.860 --> 21:28.060
I'm so sorry.

21:28.980 --> 21:30.620
I never meant for
anyone to get hurt.

21:30.700 --> 21:33.220
No. You never considered
anyone but yourself.

21:33.300 --> 21:35.460
Ondina--
-Face it, Mimmi.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.100
She lied to Veridia to get
the pod out of the way.

21:39.180 --> 21:41.420
She lost our best chance
at defeating the dragon.

21:41.500 --> 21:45.980
The pod would have failed. I told
you moon rings are no match for it!

21:46.060 --> 21:47.700
Well, we'll never know, will we?

21:47.780 --> 21:49.660
Because the pod never got
the chance to use them!

21:49.740 --> 21:52.500
If our plan had worked we wouldn't
be having this conversation!

21:52.580 --> 21:53.780
Correct.

21:53.860 --> 21:57.140
Although, in case it slipped
your mind, your plan didn't work!

21:57.220 --> 21:59.100
The dragon is still out there.

22:09.420 --> 22:11.180
Try to get some rest, Evie.

22:23.180 --> 22:25.780
Come on, let's go.
-It's okay.

22:27.100 --> 22:28.740
I'll be fine on my own.

22:30.060 --> 22:31.980
Are you sure?
-Yes.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.460
I'll see you tomorrow?

22:39.940 --> 22:41.060
Sure.

22:50.900 --> 22:52.300
<i>* In this world *</i>

22:52.380 --> 22:53.980
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

22:54.060 --> 22:57.380
<i>* You know I love</i>
<i>My island home *</i>

22:57.460 --> 22:58.780
<i>* We'll make this right *</i>

22:58.860 --> 23:04.460
<i>* Find our way</i>
<i>Through this mystery *</i>

23:04.540 --> 23:05.860

23:05.940 --> 23:07.620

23:08.940 --> 23:11.220

23:11.300 --> 23:12.540
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:12.620 --> 23:14.220
<i>* With you feeling free *</i>

23:14.300 --> 23:15.820
<i>* It's my destiny *</i>

23:15.900 --> 23:18.300
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:18.380 --> 23:19.900
<i>* Ooh ooh *</i>

23:19.980 --> 23:22.740
<i>* Ooh ooh ooh *</i>

23:22.820 --> 23:24.860
<i>* Ooh *</i>

23:24.940 --> 23:26.420

23:34.100 --> 23:35.580

23:35.660 --> 23:37.780

23:39.260 --> 23:40.820

23:40.900 --> 23:42.180

23:42.260 --> 23:44.500
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:44.580 --> 23:46.140
<i>* Together *</i>

23:46.220 --> 23:47.660
<i>* Forever *</i>

23:47.740 --> 23:51.100

in the sun *</i>

23:51.180 --> 23:52.700
<i>* Together *</i>

23:52.780 --> 23:54.380

23:54.460 --> 23:55.740

23:55.820 --> 23:59.500
