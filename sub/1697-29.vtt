00:11.140 --> 00:13.930
He's the star of
<i>Everybody Loves Raymond</i>.

00:14.780 --> 00:16.210
What's that?

00:16.780 --> 00:21.210
You know, the guy with the big nose,
never does what his wife tells him.

00:23.260 --> 00:25.090
On Tv for nine years.

00:26.900 --> 00:28.890
Nope. Never heard of it.

00:29.980 --> 00:32.490
Ray, why don't you stand up?

00:32.540 --> 00:35.250
Show everybody
what they're bidding for.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.010
Come on, everyone.

00:42.060 --> 00:45.810

but, hey, he won a couple Emmys.

00:45.860 --> 00:46.920
Three!

00:46.980 --> 00:49.850
Stop it, Ray.
You're embarrassing yourself.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.930
Hey, kid, you know who l am, right?

00:52.980 --> 00:54.970
Sure. You're Ray Romano.

00:55.020 --> 00:56.490
Whoever that is.

01:14.660 --> 01:17.040
Fine. Once, twice, sold. Happy?

01:18.860 --> 01:25.040
Okay, up next, we have a dinner with
teen pop sensation, Hannah Montana.

01:30.140 --> 01:31.570

01:31.620 --> 01:33.530
-$6,000.

01:33.580 --> 01:37.730

01:38.580 --> 01:40.960
$ 7,000, going once...

01:41.020 --> 01:42.410
You know, l got to admit,
l was kind of nervous

01:42.460 --> 01:44.370
l was gonna get stuck with some jerk.

01:44.420 --> 01:45.810
Going twice...

01:45.860 --> 01:47.290
$ 1 0,000!

Hiya, toots, wear something yummy.

01:54.620 --> 01:57.570

01:59.340 --> 02:01.250
$ 1 0,000, going once...

02:01.300 --> 02:04.050
-Guys, do something.
-l spent all my money on Roy.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.130

03:16.860 --> 03:19.130
l cannot believe it's Johnny.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.770
l haven't seen him in, like, two years.

03:23.340 --> 03:25.450
Hey, Miley. How's it going?

03:29.620 --> 03:32.050
Pretty good, just getting
some ketchup for my veggie burger.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.240
l see you like mayonnaise.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.850
l've never tried that on a veggie burger,

03:34.900 --> 03:37.280
and maybe l should,
but not today because l've already got

03:37.340 --> 03:39.690
-the ketchup thing going...
-Miley! Miley!

03:41.820 --> 03:44.930
You know,
what a lot of people don't know is,

03:45.620 --> 03:48.650
it's also a wonderful moisturiser.

03:49.420 --> 03:51.650
Here. lsn't that lovely?

03:51.700 --> 03:54.130
Moisturiser. You're pretty funny.

of something beautiful.

04:16.100 --> 04:18.769

So what if Rico wins?
How bad could it be?

Sorry, kid. There's always next year.

05:23.660 --> 05:27.360
Unless Hannah Montana wants to raise
double the money

05:27.420 --> 05:30.810
and turn this into a dinner for three.

05:30.860 --> 05:33.130
Donny without Marie say what?

05:34.020 --> 05:37.170
You know,
it would be great for the beaches.

05:37.220 --> 05:40.650
-lt's okay with me.
-Let's hear it for Hannah Montana!

06:08.620 --> 06:09.970
Hey, Roxy.

06:12.300 --> 06:15.290
l'm sorry, baby boy.
What are you doing here?

06:16.220 --> 06:18.050
Bleeding internally.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.250
What's going on down here?

06:21.300 --> 06:23.530
You two are supposed
to be at the Dodger game.

06:23.580 --> 06:25.130
Why aren't you at the Dodger game?

06:25.180 --> 06:27.210
-lt's too hot.
-Too hot?

06:27.260 --> 06:29.530
What kind of wimpy example
are you setting for your son?

06:29.580 --> 06:30.800
Now, get moving.

06:30.860 --> 06:32.610
Throw on a hat and some sunscreen,

06:32.660 --> 06:34.450
and maybe stick
one of those frozen lemonades

06:34.500 --> 06:37.060
down the back of your pants.
lt'll be fun!

06:37.100 --> 06:40.930
Now hold on there, Danica Patrick.
What's got your engines all revved up?

06:40.980 --> 06:44.170
Yeah, and when did you and Dad
go to Niagara Falls?

06:46.500 --> 06:48.960
That. Yeah. That's a funny story.

06:49.020 --> 06:52.130
Yeah, l'll tell you that
after the baseball game. Bye.

06:52.180 --> 06:54.810
Well, great. Then that will give you
a chance to explain

06:54.860 --> 06:58.010
when l wore this hula skirt
and this coconut bra,

06:58.060 --> 07:01.010
because l sure as heck
don't remember it.

07:01.060 --> 07:02.450
l'm sorry.

07:03.100 --> 07:06.450
Maybe l sort of told
somebody that, well,

07:06.500 --> 07:09.090
l live here and l'm married to you.

07:09.620 --> 07:11.050
-What?
-What?

07:12.580 --> 07:14.530
My high school reunion is this week,

07:14.580 --> 07:16.810
and Clarice Johnson
is going to be there.

07:16.860 --> 07:18.210
-Who?
-Who?

07:18.900 --> 07:22.330
Okay, will you stop doing that?
lt's very irritating.

07:22.820 --> 07:26.410
Well, so is finding out
that we're now man and wife!

07:26.460 --> 07:29.330
Yeah, start talking, Mom.

07:30.540 --> 07:34.410
l spent my entire childhood
tortured by Clarice Johnson.

07:34.460 --> 07:37.450
She was prettier, more popular,
more everything.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.880
And l will not have her
thinking that l am single

07:39.940 --> 07:43.170
and living in an apartment
with a goldfish named Denzel.

07:43.220 --> 07:44.730
But you are.

07:44.780 --> 07:46.000
No, that's not true.

07:46.060 --> 07:49.890
l had to flush Denzel.
Now l have a doggie named Diddy.

07:51.700 --> 07:54.290
And you expected us to just
go along with this?

07:54.340 --> 07:57.810
No, l didn't. l expected you
to be at the Dodger game.

07:59.940 --> 08:01.690
When she came over.

08:02.940 --> 08:07.170
Look, l'm sorry. l didn't mean to put you
in this awkward position.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.600
l don't know what l was thinking.

08:12.580 --> 08:14.930
Roxy Roker!

08:14.980 --> 08:16.530
Hello, Clarice.

08:19.540 --> 08:24.480
You must be Jackson and Robby.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.450
You know, l gotta tell you,

08:28.500 --> 08:30.570
l thought you made the whole thing up.

08:30.620 --> 08:31.680
You know something?

08:31.740 --> 08:36.010
Nobody, and l mean nobody,
in our entire class

08:36.059 --> 08:39.809
ever expected that Roxy
would ever find a man.

08:39.860 --> 08:43.610
ln fact, she was voted
''most likely to die alone.''

08:45.900 --> 08:50.450
Look, when you walk into that reunion
with that man on your arm,

08:50.500 --> 08:53.490
everybody who ever thought
you were a man,

08:55.340 --> 08:58.210
they're gonna owe you an apology.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.690
Listen, about that, l got to...

08:59.740 --> 09:01.530
Hey, no need to apologise.

09:01.580 --> 09:05.450
Check out this picture of me
and my foxy Roxy

09:05.500 --> 09:07.530
cliff diving in Acapulco.

09:10.740 --> 09:12.290
That's my man!

09:18.740 --> 09:20.370
Hey, chipmunk cheeks,

09:20.420 --> 09:23.850
which one of these colognes do you
think will drive Hannah Montana crazy?

09:23.900 --> 09:26.360
Just be yourself. That should do it.

09:26.420 --> 09:27.640
You're right.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.690
How can l do any better than
my own Ric-aroma?

09:32.660 --> 09:35.090
Oh, yes. She will be mine.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.530
Unbelievable, l finally get
a date with Johnny,

09:39.580 --> 09:42.210
and now Rico is gonna ruin everything.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.610
Thanks for getting me sick, Lilly.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.330
My pleasure.

09:51.580 --> 09:53.410
Guys, come on!

09:53.460 --> 09:56.020
The last thing l need is to get sick

09:58.140 --> 10:01.290
and miss the date with Johnny.
That's it!

10:03.620 --> 10:06.490
Save the snot, guys. l got plans for it.

10:13.820 --> 10:15.810
Get away from me. You're sick.

10:15.860 --> 10:18.130
No, it's just allergies.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.450
Sorry.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.850
Can you throw this away for me?

10:25.700 --> 10:27.610
Back off, booger boy!

10:31.140 --> 10:33.410
Hey, handsome. How's it going?

10:34.060 --> 10:35.450
Get away from me!

10:35.500 --> 10:39.450
l've got a big date on Saturday,
and nobody is going to ruin it.

10:51.020 --> 10:53.050
Curse this Ric-aroma!

10:54.140 --> 10:55.570
You owe me!

11:00.340 --> 11:02.370
That ought to get her done.

11:05.380 --> 11:07.570
Hey, can we get some nachos?

11:08.700 --> 11:10.090
No problem.

11:15.740 --> 11:18.010
On second thought, never mind.

11:21.100 --> 11:24.720
Operation Rico Sicko complete-o.

11:26.700 --> 11:29.530
l can't get the Rico taste off my mouth.

11:30.060 --> 11:32.360
l'm gonna have to boil my lips.

11:45.340 --> 11:48.450
Excuse me, can l get a bigger spoon?

11:50.780 --> 11:52.370
That's Hannah Montana.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.850
l know. She's my date.

11:54.900 --> 11:56.290
Yeah, right.

11:57.660 --> 11:58.930
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:59.900 --> 12:01.170
Hi.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.130
You said that already.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.850
l don't care. l think it's cute.

12:06.860 --> 12:10.890
You think that's cute,
say hello to drop dead gorgeous.

12:18.940 --> 12:22.250
So, l heard you went to school
in Arizona. How was that?

12:22.300 --> 12:25.050
Not bad. l played a lot of basketball.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.250
You know, it was so hot,
it was hard to get my head in the game.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.730
My ears are stuffed. What'd you say?

12:29.780 --> 12:32.690
Head in the game. Head in the game.

12:32.740 --> 12:35.650
-You know, get my head in the game.
-l get it.

12:35.700 --> 12:38.000
Now, make yourself useful,
poodle dude.

12:38.060 --> 12:41.530
l want a picture of my first date
with my future wife.

12:45.460 --> 12:49.160
Smile pretty.
This could be our first Christmas card.

12:49.220 --> 12:52.410
Yeah. ''Happy Holidays.
Love, beauty and the beast.''

12:52.980 --> 12:54.530
You so get me.

13:00.300 --> 13:03.610
You know, if you're not feeling well,
you could always go home and rest.

13:03.660 --> 13:06.970
Good idea. Let's go, love bunny.

13:07.020 --> 13:10.560
You can have my salad.
l'm taking the main course to go.

13:12.620 --> 13:16.210
Slow down, little Romeo.
We're all on this date together.

13:17.740 --> 13:19.770
lf you don't feel good,
you could go home

13:19.820 --> 13:21.010
and we could have dinner another time.

13:21.060 --> 13:26.330
You know a year, two, the afterlife.
l'm very flexible.

13:26.380 --> 13:27.810
Forget it.

13:27.860 --> 13:28.970
Fine.

13:30.660 --> 13:33.930
-We'll just... We'll just try to ignore him.
-Okay.

13:40.540 --> 13:42.610
How would you like
your shrimp prepared?

13:42.660 --> 13:44.960
Hacked into tiny little pieces.

13:50.740 --> 13:52.890
Hands off the fancy cheese.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.770
l raised you better than this.

13:55.820 --> 13:58.250
You didn't raise me at all.

13:58.980 --> 14:01.360
Don't sass your mama, boy.

14:01.420 --> 14:04.170
Roxy, you're not my ''mama!''

14:05.620 --> 14:07.170
l'm sorry.

14:07.220 --> 14:11.810
lt's just that the reunion is tonight,
and Clarice and... They're here!

14:13.220 --> 14:16.530
Robby Ray Stewart, you take your feet
off my nice coffee table.

14:16.580 --> 14:17.930
Yes, dear.

14:20.180 --> 14:21.370
Clarice!

14:21.420 --> 14:25.730
Roxy, this is my husband, Edward.

14:25.780 --> 14:27.130
Nice to meet you.

14:27.180 --> 14:28.570
Nice to meet you, Eddie.

14:28.620 --> 14:31.690
And this is my man, Robby Ray.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.050
Now, l know what you're thinking,

14:33.100 --> 14:36.170
l drilled for good-looking
and hit a gusher.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.570
-What a beautiful view you have.
-Thank you.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.210
Cost us a boatload,

14:44.260 --> 14:47.130
but my Robby-cakes
just loves to spoil me.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.650
The things we do for our ladies.

14:51.060 --> 14:53.090
You have no idea, Eddie.

14:54.260 --> 14:58.040
Hey, Mom, have you seen
my college-level physics books, Mom?

14:58.820 --> 15:01.280
l didn't know we had company, Mom.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.060
Edward, this is my stepson, Jackson.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.770
We have a son about your age.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.970
He's a genius with a violin.

15:11.900 --> 15:15.970
My Jackson is a genius, too.
On the piano.

15:16.020 --> 15:17.610
-l am?
-He is?

15:18.580 --> 15:21.650
Of course he is.
He's a real bad mamma jamma.

15:21.700 --> 15:22.840
Yeah.

15:22.940 --> 15:24.370
We'd love to hear you play something.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.450
-No, you wouldn't.
-No, you wouldn't.

15:44.540 --> 15:47.000
l like to add a little hip-hop flair.

15:47.060 --> 15:49.170
Yeah, he gets that from me.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.970
We're very proud.

16:02.980 --> 16:04.530
Jazz hands.

16:13.580 --> 16:15.410
Seriously, maybe you should go home.

16:15.940 --> 16:19.290
You'd like that, wouldn't you,
you walking pom-pom?

16:20.540 --> 16:22.290
Hey, Rico, are you not feeling good?

16:22.340 --> 16:25.730
That's too bad because
this food is really good. See?

16:29.580 --> 16:32.010
Oh, no. Oh, no!

16:32.580 --> 16:35.490
Hannah! Come on,
he's driving me crazy, too,

16:35.540 --> 16:37.130
but the poor kid is sick.

16:37.180 --> 16:40.130
And he's ruining our date.
Don't you see?

16:40.180 --> 16:43.930
He's not mean because he's sick.
He's mean because he's evil!

16:43.980 --> 16:45.730
How do you know he's evil?
You just met him.

16:45.780 --> 16:50.640
l can read people. lt's a gift.
See, you're hot and he's...

17:14.940 --> 17:18.050
Yes! l should have thought of that
an hour ago.

17:18.619 --> 17:20.849
l paid 20 grand for this?

17:22.060 --> 17:23.280
That's it. l'm out of here.

17:23.339 --> 17:25.900
Wait, Johnny.
Johnny, where are you going?

17:25.940 --> 17:27.810
As far away from you as l can get.

17:27.859 --> 17:31.610
l thought you'd be cool
and down-to-earth, like your songs.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.690
<i>Nobody's Perfect</i>. You ain't even close.

17:35.420 --> 17:38.130
Johnny! Come back!

17:38.180 --> 17:40.640
Way to get rid of the third wheel.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.170
Look, Robby Ray,

17:54.220 --> 17:57.920
can you believe that that's the girl
you fell in love with?

17:59.220 --> 18:01.520
l still can't believe it.

18:01.580 --> 18:05.090
Every day with this beautiful woman
feels like the first.

18:05.140 --> 18:07.730
l know exactly what you mean, Edward.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.730
Look. Roberta Franklin.

18:10.780 --> 18:15.170
You know, l hear she's still single,
packing groceries in a supermarket.

18:16.940 --> 18:19.010
She'll probably never show up
this evening.

18:19.060 --> 18:20.370
Well, you don't know.

18:20.420 --> 18:23.410
l mean, she may not be a millionaire
with a gorgeous husband,

18:23.460 --> 18:26.050
but she may be perfectly happy
with her life.

18:26.100 --> 18:29.640
Please, how could anybody be happy
with a life like that?

18:29.700 --> 18:31.090
lt's possible.

18:31.140 --> 18:32.360
l mean, you can get through a lot

18:32.420 --> 18:35.330
if you're surrounded by people
who love you.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.530
Well, l can tell you one thing,

18:38.580 --> 18:42.410
if l see her tonight,
l'm not speaking to her.

18:42.460 --> 18:45.370
l will. ln fact, l'll sit with her.

18:45.420 --> 18:48.770
lt turns out l have more in common
with her than l do with you.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.250
What's gotten into you?

18:50.300 --> 18:51.690
Pride.

18:51.740 --> 18:54.300
Pride in myself and who l really am.

18:54.340 --> 18:56.410
Now l'm gonna say something
l should've said

18:56.460 --> 18:58.610
the minute that you came in here.

18:58.660 --> 19:00.810
-What?
-Get out of my house!

19:04.020 --> 19:05.450
Go on, get!

19:07.340 --> 19:11.010
Way to go, Clarice.
This is why we don't have any friends.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.850
Don't worry.
l'll tell her the truth at the reunion.

19:18.900 --> 19:20.890
lf l even speak to her.

19:20.940 --> 19:24.050
And thanks, Robby.
Thank you for everything.

19:29.420 --> 19:31.850
Okay, honeymoon's over.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.560
Just one more second, snuggle-puss.

19:40.660 --> 19:43.450
l am so glad l'm done with that flu.

19:43.500 --> 19:48.410
Yeah, the only thing good about getting
sick is you feel so great when it's over.

19:50.060 --> 19:52.050
lf l live that long.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.130
l feel awful.

19:54.820 --> 19:57.730
-Poor Miley.
-Poor both of me.

19:58.100 --> 20:01.570
Johnny barely noticed Miley
and now he hates

20:03.140 --> 20:04.360
Hannah.

20:05.740 --> 20:07.130
This might not make you feel better,

20:07.180 --> 20:09.210
but sometimes things happen
for a reason.

20:09.260 --> 20:12.800
Maybe it just wasn't meant to be
with you and Johnny.

20:12.860 --> 20:15.370
Yeah. You're right.

20:15.420 --> 20:17.980
That didn't make me feel any better.

20:18.460 --> 20:19.930
You know, Miley, it's true.

20:19.980 --> 20:23.330
l mean, if l've learned anything
in my past with the ladies, it's...

20:23.380 --> 20:25.410
Don't wear your
''l'm a chick magnet'' T-shirt?

20:25.460 --> 20:27.490
That was one time, Lilly.

20:28.820 --> 20:30.410
Anyways, l was gonna say,

20:30.460 --> 20:32.530
if the universe doesn't want you
and Johnny together,

20:32.580 --> 20:34.930
-there's nothing you can do about it.
-Yeah.

20:35.940 --> 20:39.370
And if the universe wants
to change its mind, then...

20:42.060 --> 20:44.090
-How do l look?
-A little green.

20:44.140 --> 20:47.090
lt's a cute green.
lt's a really cute green.

20:49.940 --> 20:52.610
Miley? Miley Stewart?

20:53.180 --> 20:54.290
Hi.

20:54.340 --> 20:57.010
l haven't seen you in, like, two years.

20:57.420 --> 21:00.330
-You look great.
-Thanks. So do you.

21:00.380 --> 21:04.650
l heard you had a date
with Hannah Montana.

21:04.700 --> 21:07.000
Yeah, what a disaster that was.

21:07.060 --> 21:09.210
Sorry, that's too bad.

21:09.260 --> 21:11.250
She wasn't for me anyway.

21:11.660 --> 21:13.960
l like girls who are more down-to-earth.

21:14.020 --> 21:16.210
Kind of like l remember you were.

21:16.260 --> 21:17.480
Really?

21:17.980 --> 21:20.360
-Yeah, really.
-l...

21:26.980 --> 21:29.090
And the universe has spoken.

21:30.660 --> 21:32.850
And it had shrimp last night.

21:58.140 --> 22:00.250
Who you trying to kid, boy?

22:09.620 --> 22:12.530
That's right, Daddy. l'm deep.

22:20.020 --> 22:22.250
l just wanted you to love me.
