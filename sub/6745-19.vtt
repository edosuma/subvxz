Why the hell
are you following me?

10:51.918 --> 10:55.754
Hey, stranger.
Long time, no see.

10:55.756 --> 10:56.921
I didn't mean
to scare you.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.323
You don't scare me.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.724
I didn't come here to argue.
Gary, okay, you don't --

10:59.726 --> 11:02.227
I just got a question
I got to ask.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.928
I-I apologize
for the zoo thing.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.597
Oh, oh, is that
what we're calling it now?

11:05.599 --> 11:06.965
The zoo thing?

11:06.967 --> 11:08.967
Well, look, I've changed
since then, all right?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.602
I'm a completely
different person.

11:10.604 --> 11:13.304
Congratulations, Gary.
I'm very happy for you.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.240
Wait, wait.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.609
Have you seen your mother
lately?

11:17.611 --> 11:20.078
I just -- just really need
to know where she is.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.047
For the purposes
of this conversation,

11:22.049 --> 11:24.149
my mother is at the police
administration building

11:24.151 --> 11:26.017
in the major crimes division
of the l.A.P.D..

11:26.019 --> 11:27.252
Would you like
to talk to her?

11:27.254 --> 11:28.987
Because if you don't
leave me alone,

11:28.989 --> 11:30.922
I can guarantee you
an appointment in her office.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.758
Look,
what I did to you was bad.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.361
But I got clean.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.030
And you birth mother --
she got clean, too.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.933
And we've been back together
for a couple months again,

11:41.935 --> 11:44.169
and things have been going
pretty good.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.771
But then she just up and left
without even a goodbye.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.040
Oh, yeah?
And how does that feel?

11:49.042 --> 11:51.342
Not good.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.279
I-I'm just worried about her.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.817
Gary, if you've really
been living with my mother

11:58.819 --> 12:00.118
for the past two months,

12:00.120 --> 12:01.920
then you know way more
about her than I do.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.189
And if I catch you
following me again,

12:04.191 --> 12:05.423
I'm calling the police.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.425
Okay, look, there's no need

12:07.427 --> 12:09.060
to make a big deal out of this,
all right?

12:09.062 --> 12:12.430
I just -- I thought she might
have called you was all.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.102
Forget you ever saw me.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.906
Taylor:
Since we can't be certain
what this is about,

12:21.908 --> 12:23.441
instead of saying gangs,

12:23.443 --> 12:25.777
why don't we announce
miss Weaver

12:25.779 --> 12:27.445
as a drug-related homicide?

12:27.447 --> 12:29.013
I don't want the media

12:29.015 --> 12:31.316

Fritz: Including the shooting
we heard at the crime scene,

12:37.824 --> 12:39.324
we've already had five incidents
involving weapons

12:39.326 --> 12:40.925
and two assaults.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.161
No one's been killed,
but it's gonna happen.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.832
What's this asshole
going on about?

12:47.834 --> 12:51.469
Usually our cop-killing preacher
stays away from the cameras.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.838

<i> for our young men --</i>

12:53.840 --> 12:56.074

about our initial response time?

13:27.374 --> 13:28.773

to South bureau traffic.

13:40.954 --> 13:45.323
I've deliberately pushed our
response times back two minutes

excessive force issues

13:47.194 --> 13:50.328

13:56.970 --> 13:58.136
I get that, chief,

13:58.138 --> 13:59.904
but that is a hard thing
to explain

ignoring their neighborhoods.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.176

exposed, sir.

about that.

if you can triple

14:08.849 --> 14:11.115

units in the area,

14:11.117 --> 14:12.784

probation searches.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.021

and keep the peace,

be able to defuse these tensions

of $7,500.

to make our arrests,

You can't exactly see
their faces.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.464
Yeah, well, if you look
at all the wallets

five blocks away,
