Do you remember our

We were way out

You were only eight,

"I'm ready to die."

02:01.922 --> 02:03.288

"Sometimes it's as brave
to live as it is to die."

All right,
who do we know
in Idris?

02:34.588 --> 02:37.856
The only people who care
are Mom and Dad.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.625
But they're under
suspicion themselves.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.326
Uh, what about Lydia?

02:41.328 --> 02:42.361
Lydia?
Yeah.

Why do you keep
going there?

02:44.298 --> 02:45.697
She is prosecuting me.

You said
she had no choice.

She doesn't.

Everyone has a choice, Alec.

get through this

Look, I know you don't
want to believe this,

02:58.279 --> 03:00.012
but Lydia said
she would help

03:00.014 --> 03:01.380
if we can give her
a way to do it.

03:01.382 --> 03:04.016
Maybe I can get her
to delay the trial.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.218
[scoffs] Why?

03:06.220 --> 03:08.487
So I can sit here,
playing computer solitaire,

03:08.489 --> 03:10.455
while they find something else
to blame me for?

03:10.457 --> 03:12.691
I'm just a scapegoat
to the Clave.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.860
They want the Cup.

03:18.232 --> 03:21.366
Disappeared through a door

And so is the Cup.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.411
What if I was wrong?

03:32.413 --> 03:34.346
I can't find Jace because
I weakened our bond,

03:34.348 --> 03:36.148
but that doesn't mean
he can't be found,

03:36.150 --> 03:37.783

help you for once.

You are in no position
to be picky.
No, I...

04:01.075 --> 04:03.675
I can't eat this.
I can't eat at all.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.444
I can't just go
to a restaurant,
order food,

04:05.446 --> 04:07.045
and just sit there
and stare at it.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.880
You need to learn
how to adapt to what's
in front of you.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.617
On the plate,
around the meat,
what do you see?

04:11.619 --> 04:14.119
Blood.
What should I do,
lick it up?

04:14.955 --> 04:16.421
That would be suave.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.400
See? You're all set.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.302
And that move is supposed
to help me look normal?

04:31.438 --> 04:33.805
Yeah, maybe a wine glass
would be better.
Probably.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.144

my mother with him,
but we found Jace's father.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.056
What?
I thought Valentine
killed Jace's father.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.491
He tried.

Hello, Lucian.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.261
[Luke] This can't be.

I'd see anyone again.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.301
[sighs] What happened?
Demon got him.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.769
He can't fight
the poison.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.238
His runes are too weak
and he needs blood,

05:06.240 --> 05:08.073
but we can't go back
to the Institute.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.675
Simon.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.476
Simon, there's gotta be
some kind of blood
at Hotel DuMort.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.011
Could you call Raphael?
Can you get some water?

05:13.013 --> 05:14.446
I'll get some.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.514
Calling won't work.
We have to do this
in person.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.182
My van is in the garage.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.117
You drive,
I'll hide under a blanket
to stay out of the sun, and...

05:19.119 --> 05:20.585
there's underground
parking in the hotel.
Okay.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.421
He's weaker.
You gotta hurry.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.489
Jace, listen to me.
I'm coming back.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.325
Please, just hang on.
Please.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.461
Please.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.263
Simon, let's go.
Come on.

05:31.265 --> 05:32.631
Here you go.
[Luke] I thought
you were dead.

05:32.633 --> 05:33.865
There were rumors that...

05:33.867 --> 05:35.434
Everybody thought
they were true.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.703
He tried to kill me,
but I survived the attack.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.004
I've been
a prisoner ever since.

I never thought
I'd see him again.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.344
How did you survive
what he did to you?

05:45.346 --> 05:47.512
Jocelyn pulled me through.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.614
You were there.
Did he hurt her?

05:49.616 --> 05:52.017
No, and he won't.
We both know that.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.486
He'll never stop
loving Jocelyn,
even if he wanted to.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.488
She'll be safe.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.390

06:01.495 --> 06:03.362
We'll talk later.
Be with your son.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.131
Hey, Jace.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.401
I'm so sorry.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.403
Sorry? Why?

06:11.405 --> 06:12.671
What you saw...

06:12.673 --> 06:14.873
What you thought
Valentine did to me...

06:14.875 --> 06:16.441
it shaped your life.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.078
That wasn't the way
it was supposed to go.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.548
[wheezing] Am I wrong
to want to kill him?

06:23.550 --> 06:25.384
Many have tried.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.986
I'll succeed. I swear.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.555
[breathing heavily]

06:34.528 --> 06:37.095
Why can't we just take
what we need and leave?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.997
If we were transfusing
goat blood, no problem.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.932
But human blood,
that's against the Accords.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.368
I'm surprised
you know that much.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.036
Why do you keep
doing that to me?

06:45.038 --> 06:47.706
If you worked on controlling
your enhanced senses,
as you should,

06:47.708 --> 06:49.007
you wouldn't be surprised.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.575
Clary...

06:50.577 --> 06:52.444
you really have to stop
barging in here.

06:52.446 --> 06:53.945
Sorry, Raphael.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.948
We need blood.
So I've heard.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.084
Human blood.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.552
Funny how those rules
for Downworlders

07:00.554 --> 07:02.687
stop being such a big deal
when you need our help.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.790
[speaking Spanish]

07:04.792 --> 07:06.725
No can do.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.427
Okay, listen. Come on.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.964
Last night,
I bumped into Bernice.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.866
Mmm.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.935
She overheard a couple
of bridge and tunnel vamps
gossiping about Camille.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.937
You said Camille took
a leave of absence, right?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.472
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
They didn't care
about that.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.541
They said she kept around
a couple of humans.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.777
Apparently,
she'd feed on them,
but never went all the way.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.079
What are they called?
Uh, sub... submissives?

07:28.081 --> 07:29.948
Keep your voice down.

07:32.486 --> 07:35.387
They're called subjugates.
Horrible things.

07:35.389 --> 07:37.122
Even Camille
got sick of them.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.824
Okay, so,
they're gone.

07:38.826 --> 07:43.061
But keeping around
human beings just to
drain at cocktail hour,

07:43.063 --> 07:45.130
that's against
the Accords.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.498
Camille had a taste
for the real stuff.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.433
I know from experience.

07:48.435 --> 07:49.835
She had to have
something on ice.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.570
I'm sorry.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.840
If you want to tattle
to the Clave about Camille
draining humans, fine.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.341
I'm the new administration.

07:56.343 --> 07:57.809
Yeah.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.744
You could probably
get over on them
with that line,

07:59.746 --> 08:03.081
but you weren't exactly
an innocent bystander
in my case.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.150
We agreed not
to discuss that.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.686
Did we? [stammers]
Funny, I can't
really remember.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.021
Hey, did you
ever tell the Clave
what Camille did to me?

08:10.023 --> 08:13.024
You can't.
I'd be implicated.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.326
Then help us.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.297
Raphael,
Jace will die without it.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.633
[scoffs] I can't believe
you'd do this to me.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.068
Blackmail.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.371
Save it.
You're getting off easy.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.215
[keypad beeping]

08:44.658 --> 08:45.924
What's his blood type?

08:46.693 --> 08:50.095
Go for type O.
Universal donor.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.600
[keypad beeps]

08:57.404 --> 08:58.537
[Clary sighs]

09:01.842 --> 09:04.376
Thank you.
Simon, let's go.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.711
Yeah, not so fast.

09:06.713 --> 09:09.548
I like the way
you handled yourself
in this negotiation.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.149
Stick around.

09:11.151 --> 09:14.085
I'm ambassador
to the werewolves.
It's very time-consuming.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.054
Let me take
that burden off
of your shoulders.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.723
As of now,
you've been recalled.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.326
You're advisor
to the interim
chapter president.

09:22.563 --> 09:23.662
[sighs]
Don't complain.

09:23.664 --> 09:26.665
My new advisor
has to stay here.

09:27.367 --> 09:30.168
It's okay. Just go.
Really.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.570
Thank you.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.338
[kisses]

09:33.340 --> 09:34.639
Both of you.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.446
The message said,
"Have everything ready.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.348
The trial will
begin immediately."

09:43.350 --> 09:44.783
She's on her way.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.351
Yeah, but that
doesn't make any sense.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.719
Why rush this?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.688
We both know
that Clary and Jace
are still out there.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.691
Clary and Jace aren't
on trial for high treason.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.925
Oh, come on.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.860
We both know
there's nothing solid
to pin on Isabelle.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.929
If we just delay this
for a couple of weeks, it--

10:14.781 --> 10:16.348
Guards, at ease.

10:17.551 --> 10:18.950
Excuse us.

10:24.458 --> 10:27.626
I understand you've
cooked up some kind of
a marriage with...

10:28.562 --> 10:30.762
I can't imagine
what's in your mind.

10:30.764 --> 10:33.131
It's a suitable marriage
for both of us.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.067
Well, I won't dispute
that right now.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.502
As long as it
doesn't interfere

10:37.504 --> 10:39.771
with your case
against his sister.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.172
You have my assurance.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.807
I need your word,
Branwell,

10:42.809 --> 10:44.676
not flaccid reassurance.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.078
What we are seeing
is the same pattern

10:47.080 --> 10:49.514
Valentine showed
before the Uprising.

10:49.516 --> 10:53.652
Bending of the Law,
wanton defiance
of Clave order.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.687
Ma'am, I don't
honestly believe

10:55.689 --> 10:57.856
Valentine was involved
in the Seelie escape.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.724
Spare me your
honest belief.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.960
Everything's out of control.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.162
We were fools to believe
Valentine was dead.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.931
Now his daughter has the Cup,
and he's out there somewhere.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.767
I won't have it.
I'm sorry, Inquisitor.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.935
Why are you sorry?
You didn't steal the Cup.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.771
Just do your job.

11:12.773 --> 11:16.041
Be efficient, be competent,
be useful to the Clave.

11:17.678 --> 11:18.710
We'll begin this evening.

11:23.617 --> 11:25.617
The transfusion helped.
He's much better.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.352
He's gonna wanna see you.

11:27.988 --> 11:31.022
But, uh, can I, um,
talk to you for a minute?

11:31.825 --> 11:33.058
Of course.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.027
[Michael sighs]

11:36.029 --> 11:39.030
I'm... I feel
as if I know you.

11:39.032 --> 11:42.133
You're so much
like your mother.
[chuckles]

11:42.135 --> 11:45.103
You're fearless,
and loving, and you got
a mind of your own.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.273
A little stubborn,
perhaps?

11:49.242 --> 11:50.842
I should probably
work on that.

11:50.844 --> 11:51.976
Maybe not.

11:51.978 --> 11:53.645
It served Jocelyn well.

11:53.647 --> 11:55.680
She hid you from
Valentine long enough

11:55.682 --> 11:57.849
for you to grow up
without him poisoning
your mind.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.819
It was complicated...
the way I grew up.

12:00.821 --> 12:04.389
But I know she loved me,
whatever else.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.591
There was no
whatever else for her.

12:07.761 --> 12:10.862
I knew she was carrying you
when she fled from Valentine.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.597
But I never told him...

12:12.599 --> 12:14.766
no matter how much
he tormented me.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.105
Valentine thought
my mother was dead.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.539
Why would he ask about her?

12:21.541 --> 12:23.942
Because he never gave up hope.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.879
Would it help if you knew
how much he loved her?

12:27.881 --> 12:29.914
And he would have
loved you too.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.351
He's fierce in his love.

12:33.353 --> 12:34.953
Because he was so twisted.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.421
He's a mass murderer.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.524
And... [inhales deeply]
now he has her somewhere.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.693
Clary, I swear,

12:41.695 --> 12:43.428
I will help you
find your mother.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.598
I saw and heard a great deal
while I was a prisoner.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.600
Maybe that's my destiny.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.469
To bring your family
and mine together.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.507
Go see Jace.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.352
Hey.
Hey.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.390
You're looking much better.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.793
Yeah, uh... fresh blood.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.462
These vamps may be
on to something.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.863
[chuckles]

13:20.000 --> 13:22.667
I, uh... I just talked
to your father.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.970
Yeah?
Yeah, uh...

13:25.972 --> 13:28.973
Something's...
[inhales deeply]

13:28.975 --> 13:30.975
I don't know,
it's hard to explain.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.946
Do you remember that story
you once told me

13:34.948 --> 13:38.416
about the boy who trained
the falcon with kindness?

13:40.453 --> 13:42.020
That was you,
wasn't it?

13:44.090 --> 13:46.157
He broke your falcon's neck.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.093
I ruined it.

13:49.095 --> 13:52.530
It wanted to be fed.
It wouldn't hunt.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.033
But he must have known
it would hurt you.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.102
He's so loving now.
Why would he do that?

13:58.104 --> 14:00.271
We're not mundanes,
Clary.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.341
He had a lesson to teach me.
That's how it's done.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.211
[inhales deeply]
Maybe I'm just jealous.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.478
[sighs]

14:07.480 --> 14:08.847
And I know
this doesn't help,

14:08.849 --> 14:11.282
but I wish
we found Jocelyn, too.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.984
Yeah, well,
maybe finding your father

14:12.986 --> 14:15.053
will help lead us
to Valentine.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.623
Meliorn said so.
Seelies can't lie.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.158
Yeah.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.061
And they take
tangled paths
wherever they go.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.229
[chuckles]

14:25.332 --> 14:27.966
Although I think it's because
they see more that way.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.604
When we were on our journey,
I, uh...

14:33.974 --> 14:36.875
found something
I didn't even know
I was looking for.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.082
Tell me.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.651
Do you remember
the other dimension?

14:48.722 --> 14:50.088
I, uh...

14:51.024 --> 14:52.891
We said things...

14:53.927 --> 14:55.260
Felt things...

14:57.998 --> 14:59.731
Was that me?

15:00.834 --> 15:02.967
Was it... was it you?
Was it...

15:04.537 --> 15:05.904
was it even real?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.413
This is real, Clary.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.585
This is you...

15:20.587 --> 15:22.186
and me.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.788
Here and now.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.990
<i> ♪ ...of the sunrise ♪</i>

15:27.928 --> 15:31.663
<i> ♪ When you leave me behind ♪</i>

15:34.100 --> 15:36.801
<i> ♪ I felt your hands</i>
<i> in my hair ♪</i>

15:37.570 --> 15:40.104
<i> ♪ I felt your breath</i>
<i> on my neck ♪</i>

15:43.143 --> 15:46.644
<i> ♪ Yeah, I need</i>
<i> to feel you again ♪</i>

15:50.951 --> 15:53.952
But why would
Valentine tell a prisoner
what he was planning to do?

15:53.954 --> 15:56.154
He didn't.
Well, not directly.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.057
But he gave me
a way to learn
all about his plans.

15:59.059 --> 16:00.825
How do you mean?

16:00.827 --> 16:02.660
[Michael] He injected me
with Downworlder blood.

16:07.067 --> 16:10.468
The pain was excruciating.
Sometimes I was sick for days.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.938
But it's not often
you got a Shadowhunter
to experiment on.

16:13.940 --> 16:17.342
So I guess that's why
he always stopped
short of killing me.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.978
But, little by little...

16:19.980 --> 16:22.580
<i> I developed enhanced</i>
<i> hearing and vision.</i>

16:23.817 --> 16:25.583
[Valentine]
If the Seelie scouts
were able to find us here,

16:25.585 --> 16:28.653
it's only a matter of time
before more dangerous
enemies turn up.

16:28.655 --> 16:32.590
So we need to make
a move against the
New York Institute now.

16:32.592 --> 16:36.461
See, I don't need
more than one Forsaken
to breach the wards.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.997
The Clave will throw
everything it has at you.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.299
So I need a base
of operation closer
to the Institute.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.501
They will look
everywhere

16:43.503 --> 16:45.603
except right
under their noses.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.672
What about Renwick's?

16:48.942 --> 16:50.041
Who's Renwick?

16:50.043 --> 16:53.011
It's not a who.
It's a where.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.545
It's a deserted
smallpox hospital

16:54.547 --> 16:56.047
on one of the islands
of the East River.

16:56.049 --> 16:59.183
[sighs]
Under our noses is right.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.718
And we can't track
over water.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.221
[Michael] He left me
to die in that cage.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.223
Valentine never wasted
time on compassion.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.625
He won't get any from me
when the time comes.

17:07.627 --> 17:10.194
Before it does,
you need a strategy.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.164
Waiting a day could mean
the difference between
failure and success.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.866
[Jace] Okay.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.467
Clary and I will
scout Renwick's tonight.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.636
Jace, don't.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.238
Your runes are still weak.
Luke and I will go.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.706
Just take this
extra time to rest and--

17:21.708 --> 17:23.007
[Jace] I'll be fine, Clary.

17:23.009 --> 17:25.209
Jace, please.

17:28.081 --> 17:30.448
[sighs] Don't let her
get you into trouble.

17:32.585 --> 17:33.918
[sighs]

17:35.855 --> 17:37.321
You know what?

17:37.323 --> 17:40.191
I'd rather be
stripped of my runes
and sent into exile...

17:40.193 --> 17:42.060
than be part of this world.

17:42.062 --> 17:45.163
What kind of people
sacrifice justice for law?

17:45.165 --> 17:46.731
[Alec]
That's very noble, Izzy.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.099
But the high road's
not gonna look so great

17:48.101 --> 17:49.534
when you're running
for your life

17:49.536 --> 17:52.470
from a pack of demons
with no Shadowhunter
powers to protect you.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.672
Jocelyn lived as a mundane.

17:54.674 --> 17:58.009
You know Jocelyn had her
runes and her weapons.

17:58.011 --> 17:59.944
You think the demons
won't find you?

18:01.247 --> 18:03.081
[sighs] You haven't exactly
kept a low profile.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.285
You can't just
let them convict you.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.153
You need an advocate.

18:10.256 --> 18:13.724
[sighs] Tired of bickering
over the guest list
for your wedding?

18:13.726 --> 18:15.460
I need to
ask you something.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.261
Hmm. Will it take long?

18:17.263 --> 18:21.299
I have a life to live,
and there's not much
for us to talk about.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.334
It's not about me, or...

18:23.870 --> 18:25.303
any of that.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.704
This is about my sister.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.706
Oh, I see.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.410
Are you referring
to the fact that
your adorable fiancee

18:32.412 --> 18:34.145
has Isabelle
on trial for treason?

18:38.151 --> 18:41.119
[sighs] What can I
do for you, Alec?

18:41.121 --> 18:43.221
My sister wants you
to be her defense attorney.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.822
I said I would ask.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.491
But I'm sorry to bother you.
I know...

18:46.493 --> 18:49.260
a Downworlder can't defend
a Shadowhunter in court.

18:49.262 --> 18:52.797
But a Shadowhunter
accused of a crime
can choose any advocate.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.299
That can't mean
a Downworlder.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.768
The Clave was so
rigid and prejudiced

18:57.770 --> 19:00.238
back in what they call
the Time of Angels

19:00.240 --> 19:03.608
that they didn't dream
of a Shadowhunter asking
a Downworlder for help.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.576
They didn't even
bother to exclude us.

19:05.578 --> 19:09.347
So, since,
as you all say...

19:09.349 --> 19:12.150
[mimicking elderly man]
"the Law is the Law..."

19:12.152 --> 19:15.653
there's no stopping me
from slipping through
this gaping loophole.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.356
For the right price.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.859
Name it.
You.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.329
In fact,
I'll do you pro bono.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.433
Anything else?

19:31.004 --> 19:32.370
[sighs]

19:32.372 --> 19:35.006
What else is
important to you?

19:35.008 --> 19:37.842
What else tells me
that your sister means

19:37.844 --> 19:40.545
enough for you to
make a real sacrifice?

19:41.814 --> 19:44.248
Oh... I know.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.952
Your bow and quiver.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.621
How about that?

19:53.359 --> 19:54.425
[sighs]

19:55.795 --> 19:56.961
Done.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.396
Hmm.

20:10.977 --> 20:14.245
What Jace's father said
about you turning
into a werewolf?

20:15.348 --> 20:18.349
You told me that's
what Valentine said
when it happened.

20:18.351 --> 20:20.318
It was common
sentiment then.

20:22.155 --> 20:23.921
Something's not
adding up, Luke.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.257
How did you know
Michael was dead?

20:26.759 --> 20:27.825
Rumors.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.928
When the Lightwoods
took Jace into the
New York Institute,

20:30.930 --> 20:32.496
we thought Michael got hit.

20:32.498 --> 20:33.664
[sighs]

20:33.666 --> 20:34.999
There were a lot of
Circle members

20:35.001 --> 20:36.601
who were trying to avenge
Valentine back then.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.371
Was that 19 years ago?

20:40.373 --> 20:42.406
It was 20. Why?

20:43.343 --> 20:44.642
Twenty.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.349
Luke, look.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.352
[faint demons snarling]

20:58.191 --> 20:59.357
Ahh!

20:59.359 --> 21:01.425
Come on! Again.
[panting]

21:02.295 --> 21:04.428
[grunting]

21:07.300 --> 21:09.433
[Jace grunts]
Come on!

21:13.473 --> 21:14.939
Something's wrong.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.374
Us Shadowhunters
mend quickly,

21:16.376 --> 21:17.875
but after all my time
in prison,

21:17.877 --> 21:20.044
I shouldn't be able to get
a shot in on you.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.446
You're still weak.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.383
It's my bond with
Alec Lightwood.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.318
He purposefully weakened it
trying to find me...

21:27.320 --> 21:29.120
and Clary.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.421
Clary.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.456
[grunting]

21:33.960 --> 21:35.559
What do you mean, "Clary"?

21:35.561 --> 21:37.128
You were with Clary
instead of Alec.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.563
If he was so desperate
he weakened the bond
to find you,

21:39.565 --> 21:40.731
you were hiding
from him.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.733
How does that happen?

21:42.735 --> 21:44.235
Clary has the Mortal Cup.

21:45.271 --> 21:47.371
The Clave wants it.
Alec sided with the Clave.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.007
We can't trust the Clave.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.442
And you don't trust Alec?

21:51.444 --> 21:53.844
So Clary means
more to you.

21:53.846 --> 21:57.081
No, I do. I trust him.
This is different.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.349
It should be.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.484
But I've been watching you.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.954
When she suggested
that she and Luke
go to scout Renwick's...

22:03.956 --> 22:05.823
Well, she was right.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.591
You said so yourself,
I needed to train.

22:07.593 --> 22:10.294
Nothing would have stopped
the Jace I know from
going on a mission,

22:10.296 --> 22:11.929
even as a child.

22:14.334 --> 22:17.201
I see how attached
you are to her,
but this kind of thing...

22:17.203 --> 22:19.270
doesn't always
make you stronger.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.139
Shadowhunters
have relationships.

22:22.141 --> 22:23.374
Yes, of course.

22:23.376 --> 22:26.110
When we find someone,
it's for life.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.613
But we're also warriors,

22:29.615 --> 22:31.449
born to serve.

22:31.451 --> 22:34.785
And some of us are meant
to render greater
services than others.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.354
I thought you
were one of those.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.689
Getting involved too
deeply with any woman

22:38.691 --> 22:40.458
will only weaken
your resolve.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.394
So you're saying
I can't be with Clary?

22:43.396 --> 22:46.063
I'm saying it wasn't
what I expected of you.

22:47.300 --> 22:49.266
But seeing you two...

22:50.503 --> 22:52.036
[sighs]

22:52.672 --> 22:55.106
What kind of father
would deprive his son
of that happiness?

22:56.342 --> 22:58.075
Maybe you should rest.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.377
[sighs]

23:04.650 --> 23:06.784
Will I survive
if I touch it?

23:07.687 --> 23:09.220
If you tell the truth.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.324
[Silent Brother]
By the power of this sword,

23:13.326 --> 23:16.927
do you swear to
defend your client with
integrity and honesty?

23:16.929 --> 23:18.963
No argument from me on that.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.604
Make your case, warlock.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.106
My case is simple.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.941
It is true that
Isabelle Lightwood

23:30.943 --> 23:32.576
acted against
the orders of the Clave

23:32.578 --> 23:34.945
by trying to free
the Seelie, Meliorn.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.581
But she did not act against
the interests of the Clave.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.383
Preventing the
forced questioning

23:39.385 --> 23:40.551
and possible death
of a Seelie

23:40.553 --> 23:42.620
may have saved the Accords.

23:42.622 --> 23:45.956
We're not here to speculate
what might have happened

23:45.958 --> 23:48.526
if the defendant
hadn't interfered.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.394
You mean what
might have happened

23:50.396 --> 23:53.864
if she hadn't stopped
the Silent Brothers
from torturing a Seelie?

23:53.866 --> 23:56.700
I await a valid argument.
Do you have one?

23:58.104 --> 24:00.905
What you really
want is the Mortal Cup.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.273
My client
doesn't have it.

24:02.275 --> 24:05.242
Since this whole
proceeding isn't about
what it's really about,

24:05.244 --> 24:07.578
I move to have
this case dismissed.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.880
You're out of order.
No.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.615
This whole thing
is out of order.

24:11.617 --> 24:14.585
It's not Isabelle's fault.
It's the Cup!

24:14.587 --> 24:16.387
Put the Cup on trial!

24:21.461 --> 24:22.793
We couldn't even
count the demons.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.829
Yeah, but we still gotta
get Jocelyn out of there.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.163
That would be
a suicide mission.

24:26.165 --> 24:27.431
Doesn't have to be.

24:27.433 --> 24:29.633
I have the Cup.
Demons have to obey me.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.001
[Michael] That's what
Valentine wants.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.937
He knows
you'll do anything
to save your mother.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.572
He wants you to
take out the Cup
and use it.

24:34.574 --> 24:35.973
And if I do?
[Michael] He'll take it.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.508
And he'll kill us, too.

24:37.510 --> 24:39.510
[sighs] Let him try.

24:50.623 --> 24:54.492
You have led us to believe
that you alone carried out
this operation.

24:55.628 --> 24:58.829
But Clary Fairchild
was seen near the City
of Bones that night.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.631
Maybe she was out
for a walk.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.834
And you expect us
to believe that you
distracted the guards,

25:03.836 --> 25:06.170
and escaped with the
prisoner on your own?

25:07.106 --> 25:09.507
Pretty slick, right?

25:10.510 --> 25:13.344
I suggest you think about
how slick it would be

25:13.346 --> 25:15.679
when Valentine
uses the Mortal Cup

25:15.681 --> 25:18.883
to raise an army of
rogue Shadowhunters.

25:18.885 --> 25:21.886
I don't want
Valentine to succeed.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.888
Well, that's
the first sane thing
I've heard from you.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.723
[Isabelle]
You know what's insane?

25:25.725 --> 25:27.157
Thinking we have
the right to treat

25:27.159 --> 25:30.194
a Downworlder's life
as worthless.

25:30.196 --> 25:33.497
Isabelle, I should warn you
that everything you say here

25:33.499 --> 25:34.832
will be considered
in the verdict.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.801
Good. [loudly]
Consider this.

25:37.803 --> 25:40.337
Valentine didn't
come out of nowhere.

25:40.339 --> 25:44.742
We use our angel blood
to justify everything we do,
just like him.

25:44.744 --> 25:48.412
Like him, we forget that
we are not only angels.

25:48.414 --> 25:50.481
We are part mundane.

25:50.483 --> 25:52.016
We can be afraid.

25:52.018 --> 25:53.684
And fear makes us cruel.

25:53.686 --> 25:57.588
And we turn our fear
to Downworlders
just as Valentine did.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.223
And just as he did...

25:59.225 --> 26:02.226
we will end up
turning on each other.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.762
You think we're
doing that to you?

26:07.166 --> 26:09.633
You have to answer
that for yourself...

26:10.703 --> 26:12.169
Madam Inquisitor.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.942
[Luke] This doesn't
make any sense.

26:17.944 --> 26:20.210
There were
a thousand demons
here last night.

26:20.212 --> 26:21.512
That's what he wants.

26:21.514 --> 26:24.148
He wants to draw us in,
force Clary to use the Cup.

26:26.519 --> 26:28.619
[all grunting]

26:35.261 --> 26:36.327
Watch your back!

26:37.697 --> 26:39.630
[all grunting]

26:52.078 --> 26:55.145
[panting] I forgot
how much fun this was.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.947
[Blackwell] Graymark!

26:56.949 --> 26:59.116
Where are your claws?

26:59.118 --> 27:01.819
I don't need special powers
to kill you, coward.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.654
Don't bother with that.

27:03.656 --> 27:06.056
It only lights up
for real Shadowhunters.

27:06.058 --> 27:09.126
Find Jocelyn.
I got this.

27:10.463 --> 27:12.830
We need to
find Clary. Now.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.710
Mom.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.814
Mom! [whimpers]

28:03.816 --> 28:05.416
Mom, please, wake up.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.225
Where's Luke?

28:15.227 --> 28:17.027
We left him
fighting Blackwell.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.296
Luke told us to
leave him, Clary.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.799
[demons snarling]
[Jace grunting]

28:22.401 --> 28:23.634
No! What are you doing?
Get back!

28:23.636 --> 28:26.203
Jace, we cannot shut Luke out!
He has to make it inside!

28:26.205 --> 28:27.805
No, Clary,
there is not enough time!

28:27.807 --> 28:29.006
We have to secure the room.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.140
We don't even know
if Luke is still...

28:30.142 --> 28:31.308
Alive?

28:31.310 --> 28:32.710
Jace, no.
You have to tell him!

28:32.712 --> 28:35.713
We cannot shut Luke out!
He will die for nothing!

28:35.715 --> 28:37.081
I can't wake her up.
[demons screeching]

28:37.083 --> 28:38.882
Luke wants you and
Jocelyn out of here.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.651
That's all he cares about.

28:40.653 --> 28:41.852
Pull yourself together.

28:41.854 --> 28:44.521
Clary, if you don't help us,
no one survives.

28:44.523 --> 28:47.224
Do you understand?
We will get her home.
Look at me!

28:47.226 --> 28:49.993
We will find
a way to wake her up.
Do you believe me?

28:49.995 --> 28:51.428
[demons screeching]

28:51.430 --> 28:52.730
Get ready.

28:58.871 --> 29:01.605
I'd like to call
Lydia Branwell
to the stand.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.942
I don't see
the relevance.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.210
[Magnus] Well,
that makes two of us.

29:06.212 --> 29:08.011
I don't see the relevance
of this whole trial.

29:08.013 --> 29:09.179
Ms. Branwell?

29:09.181 --> 29:11.248
If you'll take the stand?

29:22.394 --> 29:23.927
I just have
one question.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.864
Why are you prosecuting
this case?

29:30.569 --> 29:32.469
Answer the question,
Counselor.

29:35.074 --> 29:38.175
Because the Law
is hard, but...

29:38.978 --> 29:40.544
it is the Law.

29:40.546 --> 29:41.845
[sighs]

29:42.782 --> 29:44.715
[Lydia] But that
doesn't make it right.

29:44.717 --> 29:48.285
We're trying someone
for being compassionate,

29:48.287 --> 29:49.920
thinking for herself.

29:49.922 --> 29:53.891
She saved a life that was
being sacrificed for nothing.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.159
That will be enough,
Branwell.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.828
No... it isn't.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.465
I'm looking out
at the faces here.

30:02.401 --> 30:05.169
A brother and sister
who disagree on everything

30:05.171 --> 30:07.905
except for how much
they love one another...

30:07.907 --> 30:10.374
and how loyal they are
to each other.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.343
A man who took this case

30:13.345 --> 30:16.146
pretending to want payment
in rare objects,

30:16.148 --> 30:18.415
but who really believes

30:18.417 --> 30:21.418
that injustice
toward his friends
is intolerable.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.420
Loyalty,

30:23.956 --> 30:25.923
decency, compassion,

30:25.925 --> 30:27.491
love.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.860
These are the concepts
that we should consider

30:29.862 --> 30:32.496
to decide guilt or innocence
in a case like this.

30:32.498 --> 30:35.866
Those are not
the concepts of the Law.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.168
Now, enough
of this nonsense.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.803
I agree.

30:39.805 --> 30:41.605
The case is nonsense.

30:43.108 --> 30:44.608
I withdraw the charges.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.744
[crowd applauding]

30:56.889 --> 30:58.455
[laughing]

30:58.457 --> 31:00.224
Silence!

31:00.860 --> 31:01.992
Order!

31:01.994 --> 31:03.060
[bangs gavel]

31:03.562 --> 31:05.295
Silence!

31:07.533 --> 31:12.069
If you think
refusing to prosecute
exculpates the defendant,

31:12.071 --> 31:13.203
you are wrong.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.905
She is guilty.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.209
The defense was correct.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.745
The Clave wants
the Mortal Cup.

31:21.747 --> 31:24.181
If it is returned
within 24 hours,

31:24.183 --> 31:25.883
this ruling will be vacated.

31:25.885 --> 31:30.087
If not, Isabelle Lightwood
will be stripped of her runes

31:30.089 --> 31:35.058
and exiled from the society
of the Shadowhunters forever.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.230
Clary, now!

31:40.232 --> 31:42.032
We can't wait any longer.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.934
[banging on door]
[demons screeching]

31:45.671 --> 31:46.803
[sighs]

31:47.606 --> 31:49.740
Demons, I command you!

31:49.742 --> 31:51.742
Find Valentine!

31:54.947 --> 31:56.947
[demons screeching]
[banging continues]

32:02.955 --> 32:06.189
Demons, find Valentine!

32:13.198 --> 32:14.464
Let me try.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.003
[exhales]

32:22.274 --> 32:23.674
[Jace] Come on.

32:28.080 --> 32:28.946
No.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.514
No.

32:32.818 --> 32:33.951
[Michael groans]

32:45.664 --> 32:46.964
Valentine.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.799
Demons...

32:48.801 --> 32:50.634
attack my enemies!

32:50.636 --> 32:52.069
[demons snarling]

32:54.006 --> 32:56.473
I command you!

32:56.475 --> 32:58.075
[demons screeching]

33:00.079 --> 33:02.312
Knock it off, guys!

33:02.314 --> 33:04.348
[screeching stops]

33:05.317 --> 33:08.485
You're not
the only one who knows
how to cast a glamour.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.296
Should we let the demons
take care of this?

33:19.298 --> 33:20.864
Or--
No.

33:20.866 --> 33:22.599
Send them away.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.034
He's mine.

33:24.870 --> 33:26.103
[Clary] Demons, be gone!

33:28.307 --> 33:30.574
You pretended
to be my father.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.511
I wasn't pretending, Jace.
You murdered him.

33:34.513 --> 33:35.946
You're a liar!

33:36.682 --> 33:38.348
I am your father.
I always have been.

33:39.051 --> 33:41.351
The face that you saw
as Michael Wayland was mine.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.220
Then and now.

33:43.222 --> 33:45.322
It was a powerful glamour.

33:45.324 --> 33:48.859
I want you to know me
as I am.

33:48.861 --> 33:51.194
To know the truth about me...

33:52.064 --> 33:53.196
and you.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.065
[Clary] Jace!
Jace, don't listen to him!

33:55.067 --> 33:56.500
He's my father.
We know that for a fact.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.301
Yes, that's true.
That's a fact.

33:58.303 --> 34:00.070
I am your father, Clary.

34:03.242 --> 34:04.441
And Jace's.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.078
Think about it.

34:09.248 --> 34:12.549
Why are the two of you
so drawn together?

34:12.551 --> 34:14.985
You are meant to be.

34:14.987 --> 34:18.055
Blood calls to blood, no?

34:19.158 --> 34:20.624
Ah...

34:21.193 --> 34:22.893
[panting]

34:33.005 --> 34:34.604
[sighs]
My dear family...

34:34.606 --> 34:36.206
together at last.

34:36.208 --> 34:39.176
A lost mother, found.
A brother and sister,
finally united.

34:39.178 --> 34:41.278
[yelling]

34:41.280 --> 34:42.746
You won't kill me.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.381
[breathing heavily]
You won't kill me.

34:44.383 --> 34:46.183
I said that you were weak,
and I meant it.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.918
[grunts]
What's wrong, Jace?

34:47.920 --> 34:49.119
Can't kill the man
who raised you, hmm?

34:49.121 --> 34:50.187
[Clary] I can!

34:51.256 --> 34:53.290
Go ahead, Clary.
Two for one.

34:53.292 --> 34:55.058
[panting] We can't even
fight back, huh?

34:55.060 --> 34:56.293
No?

34:57.396 --> 35:01.364
Come with me, son.
You know that
you love me.

35:01.366 --> 35:03.266
Your sister is
welcome to join us.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.202
And bring your
mother along.

35:05.938 --> 35:07.871
We can find a way
to get her moving again.

35:09.074 --> 35:10.474
[Jace grunts]

35:15.147 --> 35:16.746
[panting]
[thud]

35:16.748 --> 35:18.315
[Clary gasps]

35:22.821 --> 35:24.488
[Luke] Jocelyn.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.459
I'm taking you home.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.279
[Jace] Clary gave
Lydia the Cup.

35:49.281 --> 35:51.715
Hodge is taking her
to lock it up until
she goes back to Idris.

35:53.185 --> 35:54.417
Okay.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.153
"Okay"?

35:56.155 --> 35:57.554
That's it, Alec?

35:58.457 --> 35:59.990
I don't want to
get into it.

35:59.992 --> 36:01.158
Stop.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.860
I do wanna get into it.

36:05.164 --> 36:06.530
You almost killed me.

36:06.532 --> 36:09.699
You weakened our  <i> parabatai</i>
bond just to find me.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.001
You betrayed me.

36:11.003 --> 36:12.135
You lied to me.

36:12.137 --> 36:13.503
You attacked me
when I was doing

36:13.505 --> 36:14.804
what we should've
been doing together.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.541
I didn't betray you, Alec.
I saved you from yourself!

36:21.213 --> 36:22.946
If you'd have taken
Meliorn to be tortured,

36:22.948 --> 36:25.682
you would have that
on your conscience
for the rest of your life.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.984
[scoffs] Really?
Really.

36:27.986 --> 36:31.121
Everything you do is for
a higher principle.

36:31.123 --> 36:32.455
You took the Cup,

36:32.457 --> 36:35.358
and you nearly handed it
over to Valentine.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.861
That was not our intention.
You know that.

36:37.863 --> 36:38.295
"Our intention"?

36:42.301 --> 36:44.868
Was it your intention to
risk Izzy's life for hers?

36:44.870 --> 36:47.637
This isn't about Clary.
This is about you.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.974
Now, I'm gonna go
tell my sister...

36:52.377 --> 36:54.211
that she still has
a future.

37:09.361 --> 37:10.794
Do you think
she can hear us?

37:11.763 --> 37:13.096
Where is she?

37:13.999 --> 37:17.067
Is she trapped in there?
Is she somewhere else?

37:18.003 --> 37:21.004
I mean, I... I look at her,
and I see my mother, but...

37:23.242 --> 37:24.808
How did you know...

37:25.611 --> 37:27.010
that he was Valentine?

37:28.447 --> 37:30.814
There was...
just something off.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.084
He told me that he knew
my mother was pregnant,

37:34.086 --> 37:35.585
but he couldn't have.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.087
You should've told me.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.422
Would you have believed me?

37:40.525 --> 37:41.825
[sighs]

37:42.761 --> 37:44.494
There's something
wrong with me.

37:45.397 --> 37:47.464
You wanted
to believe him.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.366
I would have, too.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.700
No.

37:52.471 --> 37:55.472
I'm weak.
He was right about that.

37:56.808 --> 37:58.408
I should have killed him.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.443
He's your father, Jace.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.446
Yours, too, Clary.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.350
[sighs]

38:08.453 --> 38:09.452
You would have done it.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.364
I'm sorry
we lost the case.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.301
Yeah...

38:24.303 --> 38:26.303
but at least
we lost it with style.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.478
Jace and Clary are back.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.348
They gave the Cup to Lydia.

38:39.451 --> 38:40.850
You're free to go.

38:40.852 --> 38:42.352
[sighs]

38:43.021 --> 38:45.922
[exclaims] You were right,
they came back. You knew!

38:45.924 --> 38:48.491
Oh, I didn't actually.

38:48.493 --> 38:49.492
[sighs]

38:50.996 --> 38:52.529
Well, my work is done here.

38:55.600 --> 38:56.933
Walk me out, will you?

38:56.935 --> 38:59.402
We have some
business to settle.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.276
Go. I'll be fine.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.279
[Alec sighs]

39:13.852 --> 39:15.552
[sighs]

39:26.064 --> 39:27.497
As promised...

39:27.499 --> 39:29.532
payment in full.

39:29.534 --> 39:30.967
Thank you.

39:40.512 --> 39:41.578
I just want you
to know...

39:41.580 --> 39:43.680
Lydia was wonderful
in court.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.849
She's great.
So you get it.

39:45.851 --> 39:47.050
No, Alec.

39:48.353 --> 39:50.820
I get her.
I like her.

39:52.157 --> 39:53.757
But you don't
have to marry her.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.525
Yes, I do, Magnus.

39:55.527 --> 39:58.595
You'll be lonely
all your life,
and so will she.

39:59.398 --> 40:00.830
Neither of you deserve it.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.967
And I don't either.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.908
I don't know what
to do with these.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.176
You keep them for me.

40:16.515 --> 40:17.814
[sighs]

40:25.457 --> 40:29.192
Wait,
did you see Michael Wayland
transform into Valentine?

40:29.194 --> 40:30.360
After I took care
of Blackwell,

40:30.362 --> 40:31.428
I couldn't get
back in the room

40:31.430 --> 40:33.630
until all the demons
cleared out.

40:33.632 --> 40:34.764
Huh.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.467
[sighs]

40:37.469 --> 40:39.402
And then all I saw
was Jocelyn.

40:39.404 --> 40:40.937
You're still in love with her.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.640
Being a werewolf
didn't change that.

40:43.642 --> 40:44.974
[softly] No.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.212
You know,
Clary was right.

40:49.214 --> 40:50.847
Some things can't change.

40:51.883 --> 40:54.551
And when you find the one...
that's it.

40:54.553 --> 40:55.718
[chuckles softly] Yeah.

40:55.720 --> 41:00.623
[stammers] I don't
know if you know this,
but I thought I found...

41:00.625 --> 41:01.758
you know...

41:01.760 --> 41:05.128
[stammers]
It doesn't matter now.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.796
But there was this other guy.

41:06.798 --> 41:09.766
He was big, handsome,
full of sh...

41:09.768 --> 41:11.501
[chuckles]
Forget it, it's okay.

41:11.503 --> 41:14.737
He's okay, you know.
I'm over it.

41:14.739 --> 41:17.540
I guess I'll just
always be alone.

41:18.477 --> 41:19.576
[sighs] So...

41:22.481 --> 41:23.880
Simon.
Yeah.

41:26.017 --> 41:28.017
There's more to
what happened at Renwick's.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.352
I mean,
if you want to know.

41:29.354 --> 41:30.487
Yeah.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.591
Turns out Valentine
is Jace's father
as well as Clary's.

41:36.528 --> 41:38.194
They're brother and sister.

41:39.664 --> 41:42.899
Uh... brother and sis...

41:43.969 --> 41:46.603
Okay. [chuckles]
Wait, so...

41:47.439 --> 41:49.772
Clary and Jace are...
brother and sister.

41:49.774 --> 41:52.342
That means...
That means they can't...

41:55.614 --> 41:57.347
Well, what do you know?

42:15.534 --> 42:17.133
[sighs]
