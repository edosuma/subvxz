00:17.382 --> 00:18.549
Who are you?

00:20.350 --> 00:22.453
Are you my daddy?

00:51.136 --> 00:54.017
Yuck, you can't use this.

00:54.018 --> 00:55.435
But I'm hungry.

00:56.888 --> 00:59.721
Chill, I'll make you some toast.

01:27.562 --> 01:29.939
Aren't you late for school?

01:29.940 --> 01:31.273
It's Saturday.

01:41.256 --> 01:42.673
You kidding me?

01:54.359 --> 01:58.122
Looks like Fat Jack didn't
make it home, again.

01:58.123 --> 02:00.037
It's just what we need.

02:00.038 --> 02:03.538
One of your customers crashing on my sofa.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.111
Say Gabe,
you still keep those three

03:51.112 --> 03:53.037
things on your coffee table?

03:53.038 --> 03:54.486
Only two now.

03:54.487 --> 03:57.622
Bible's back on the bookshelf
with all the other fiction.

03:57.623 --> 03:59.134
I stopped reading it.

03:59.135 --> 04:00.796
Do you know why?

04:00.797 --> 04:02.518
Yeah doc, I do.

04:02.519 --> 04:03.905
Do you?

04:03.906 --> 04:06.847
How 'bout you tell me instead?

04:06.848 --> 04:09.020
I guess I just don't see the point.

04:09.021 --> 04:11.204
It helps you move on with your life.

04:11.205 --> 04:14.015
How have I not moved on?

04:14.016 --> 04:16.423
I moved out when my wife asked me to,

04:16.423 --> 04:19.007
now she's marrying another man.

04:20.583 --> 04:23.661
I mean darn hell, I've been moved on.

04:23.662 --> 04:25.652
And how do you feel about that?

04:25.653 --> 04:27.650
How would you feel in my shoes?

04:27.651 --> 04:30.157
How I would feel doesn't matter.

04:30.158 --> 04:31.158
Yeah.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.268
How would the good doctor feel if he was

04:33.269 --> 04:34.918
one of the unlucky ones who couldn't

04:34.919 --> 04:36.919
say no to another drink?

04:38.014 --> 04:40.212
And because of that you lost everything.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.880
Your wife, your job,

04:44.716 --> 04:47.268
you put people in the hospital.

04:47.269 --> 04:49.310
People whose injuries have healed.

04:49.311 --> 04:50.765
People who wouldn't have been injured

04:50.766 --> 04:53.633
in the first place if
it weren't for you doc.

04:53.634 --> 04:54.884
If you were me.

04:55.818 --> 04:58.341
About those people who were
injured in the accident...

04:58.342 --> 05:00.204
People I hurt.

05:00.205 --> 05:02.220
You can say it.

05:02.221 --> 05:05.388
Do you believe they've forgiven you?

05:06.505 --> 05:07.505
Who cares?

05:09.165 --> 05:11.082
Clearly Gabe, you do.

05:14.021 --> 05:16.709
Have you forgiven yourself?

05:16.710 --> 05:19.035
When are you gonna stop asking me that?

05:19.036 --> 05:21.331
How many times have
you answered yourself?

05:21.332 --> 05:22.749
Yeah let's see.

05:24.114 --> 05:26.315
90 days in a jail cell, 24 hours in a day,

05:26.316 --> 05:29.316
that's 2,026 hours times 60 minutes,

05:30.165 --> 05:32.082
that's 126,000 minutes.

05:33.229 --> 05:36.798
Ah yes, the architect with
the computer for a brain.

05:36.799 --> 05:38.112
Anyway the answer is zero.

05:38.113 --> 05:42.398
Why ask a question when
you know the answer?

05:42.399 --> 05:45.340
And it's former architect.

05:45.341 --> 05:46.758
Oh, since when?

05:47.637 --> 05:49.304
Since I got fired.

05:50.758 --> 05:54.819
That's when I decided to come back home.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.244
A little town near here.

05:56.245 --> 05:59.997
Well, I'm glad you decided
to continue your counseling.

05:59.998 --> 06:02.308
You know it was court ordered doc.

06:02.309 --> 06:07.340
By the way, you definitely
have a lot of work to do.

06:07.364 --> 06:09.532
I hope when you came here Gabe

06:09.533 --> 06:11.757
you weren't running away.

06:11.758 --> 06:14.925
Maybe I was going back to something.

06:34.336 --> 06:35.336
Sorry.

06:36.032 --> 06:37.115
I'm so sorry.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.582
Maggie's daddy came home.

06:47.583 --> 06:48.627
Yeah, so?

06:48.628 --> 06:50.855
So is our daddy gonna come home?

06:50.856 --> 06:52.494
I've told you this a million times,

06:52.495 --> 06:54.649
your daddy and my daddy don't live here.

06:54.650 --> 06:56.299
And they're not the same daddy.

06:56.300 --> 06:59.144
I know that, but they're
supposed to be, right?

06:59.145 --> 07:00.015
Says who?

07:00.016 --> 07:01.719
Says the lady at Sunday school.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.161
You don't go to Sunday school.

07:03.162 --> 07:05.334
Maggie goes, she told me.

07:05.335 --> 07:07.835
Well whoop Dee freaking doo.

07:09.464 --> 07:11.979
But you met my daddy right?

07:11.980 --> 07:13.324
Yeah, probably.

07:13.325 --> 07:16.167
I just didn't know which one he was.

07:16.168 --> 07:18.266
Why do you wanna know about daddy so much?

07:18.267 --> 07:19.782
'Cause mama don't care.

07:19.783 --> 07:20.623
About what?

07:20.624 --> 07:21.956
About nothing.

07:38.696 --> 07:40.779
I'll take it from here.

07:42.728 --> 07:45.035
Anywhere you like.

07:45.036 --> 07:49.417
I wasn't sure if I
should wait and be seated.

07:49.418 --> 07:51.295
We're not that fancy here.

07:51.296 --> 07:52.296
Coffee?

07:53.297 --> 07:54.526
Menu?

07:54.527 --> 07:56.473
Sure.

07:56.474 --> 07:59.391
I'll just give you a few minutes.

08:00.592 --> 08:02.510
Emma darling.

08:02.511 --> 08:03.966
Yes Tate.

08:03.967 --> 08:07.382
That pie being shipped
in from out of state?

08:07.383 --> 08:10.839
Chief, I think that
shipments just pulling in.

08:10.840 --> 08:11.840
Thank you.

08:19.656 --> 08:20.656
Coffee.

08:21.495 --> 08:24.328
I heard this was your place now.

08:25.750 --> 08:28.500
I remember when it was our place.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.668
It's been a long time, how've you been?

08:32.669 --> 08:35.086
It's probably not the time.

08:36.894 --> 08:38.138
Oh.

08:38.139 --> 08:39.139
Right.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.076
Are there any specials?

08:42.077 --> 08:43.905
Everything on the menu is special.

08:43.905 --> 08:46.175
Pecan pie sure is.

08:46.176 --> 08:49.002
Thanks for the review Tate.

08:49.003 --> 08:50.207
How's the chicken fried steak?

08:50.208 --> 08:53.357
Hey Tate, how's that
chicken fried steak?

08:53.358 --> 08:55.012
Fourth time I've had it this week.

08:55.013 --> 08:56.430
I'm not dead yet.

08:57.462 --> 08:59.085
There ya have it.

08:59.086 --> 09:01.365
Chicken fried steak it is.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.228
Pecan pie for dessert.

09:03.229 --> 09:04.229
Good call.

09:13.351 --> 09:14.684
T, T, wake up.

09:16.976 --> 09:19.005
Will you make me some pancakes?

09:19.006 --> 09:20.644
Can't mama make 'em?

09:20.645 --> 09:22.743
She's asleep in the bathroom.

09:22.744 --> 09:24.356
The bathroom?

09:24.357 --> 09:27.268
Yeah, she didn't wanna wake up.

09:27.269 --> 09:29.015
Get dressed, put your shoes on.

09:29.016 --> 09:30.049
How come?

09:30.050 --> 09:31.692
Just do it now.

09:31.693 --> 09:33.276
I'll check on mama.

09:34.743 --> 09:37.781
Mama?

09:37.782 --> 09:38.782
Mama.

09:43.341 --> 09:44.341
Mama!

09:46.376 --> 09:47.376
Mama!

09:51.629 --> 09:52.629
Maze.

09:53.488 --> 09:54.488
Maze you up?

09:55.728 --> 09:56.728
Mazey.

09:57.576 --> 09:58.576
You awake?

10:00.742 --> 10:02.324
Mazey.

10:02.325 --> 10:03.325
Mazey.

10:04.702 --> 10:05.908
Dill!

10:05.909 --> 10:07.584
Dill, get in here!

10:07.585 --> 10:09.918
The old lady's fading on us.

10:10.803 --> 10:13.042
Yo Mazey, damn it Mazey.

10:13.043 --> 10:14.626
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:19.207 --> 10:20.993
We gotta go now.

10:20.994 --> 10:24.048
What about mama and I want pancakes?

10:24.049 --> 10:26.632
We'll worry about that later.

10:34.883 --> 10:36.980
Hey kid, come here!

10:36.981 --> 10:37.981
Kid!

10:57.619 --> 11:00.127
Was that mama in the ambulance?

11:28.311 --> 11:29.894
Let's go now.

11:36.192 --> 11:37.423
Pack up.

11:37.424 --> 11:38.517
For what?

11:38.518 --> 11:39.872
Pretend we're going camping.

11:39.873 --> 11:41.373
We ain't
never been camping.

11:41.374 --> 11:43.207
Just get some stuff.

11:47.572 --> 11:48.905
No cone animals.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.909
The pillows too big.

11:53.910 --> 11:57.773
I can't
sleep without my pillow.

11:57.774 --> 11:59.607
Fine, just use mine.

12:02.071 --> 12:05.105
Remember, we ain't got no
bicycle now, we walking.

12:05.106 --> 12:06.759
Where are we going?

12:06.760 --> 12:08.177
Don't know yet.

12:10.176 --> 12:11.843
Police department!

12:17.654 --> 12:20.321
Police department, anybody home!

12:24.512 --> 12:26.889
How come we didn't answer the door?

12:26.890 --> 12:28.890
Shh, I'm thinking.

12:34.536 --> 12:35.536
Hey Hilly.

12:55.230 --> 12:57.148
You said we were gonna go camping.

12:57.149 --> 12:59.679
I told you, I forgot something.

12:59.680 --> 13:00.513
You should've thought of that

13:00.514 --> 13:02.367
before we walked a thousand miles.

13:02.368 --> 13:05.921
Give me a break, we barely
got past the Johnson's place.

13:05.922 --> 13:06.922
Wait here.

14:01.478 --> 14:02.728
Hey T, Angel.

14:05.805 --> 14:06.888
Anybody home?

14:27.933 --> 14:29.350
Hey kid that you?

15:03.497 --> 15:06.128
Geeze kid, you scared the crap out of me!

15:06.129 --> 15:09.557
I ought to kick your butt for
sneaking around like that!

15:09.558 --> 15:11.225
Where's your sister?

15:13.140 --> 15:14.473
We need to talk.

15:16.295 --> 15:17.295
Hey Angel!

15:18.014 --> 15:21.431
Angel!

15:28.710 --> 15:31.793
Yeah you better run you little freak!

15:47.353 --> 15:49.020
Hey you're dead kid!

15:50.609 --> 15:51.776
Like your mom!

16:06.161 --> 16:08.781
You're not
your father Gabe.

16:08.782 --> 16:10.909
How so?

16:10.910 --> 16:14.243
'Cause the people I ran into didn't die?

16:16.822 --> 16:18.917
Well they didn't.

16:18.918 --> 16:21.116
Doesn't that count for something?

16:21.117 --> 16:22.200
Blind luck.

16:23.453 --> 16:26.757
So you consider yourself a lucky man.

17:03.024 --> 17:04.829
Why can't we go home?

17:04.829 --> 17:07.163
Dill wants to kill me, remember?

17:07.164 --> 17:10.465
Yeah, so, are we camping out again?

17:10.467 --> 17:12.357
Afraid so squirt.

17:12.358 --> 17:15.172
But I have to go to the bathroom.

17:15.173 --> 17:17.218
Why didn't you go when
we were at the store?

17:17.219 --> 17:18.547
I asked you if you had to.

17:18.548 --> 17:20.675
I didn't have to go then.

17:20.675 --> 17:22.093
Dang it squirt.

17:25.813 --> 17:27.842
Here's your toilet paper.

17:27.843 --> 17:29.172
It is not.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.117
Well it'll work until we get some.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.250
Will not.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.826
Do you have to go or not?

17:34.827 --> 17:37.410
You're a meanie head!

17:52.443 --> 17:53.443
Alright.

17:55.045 --> 18:00.045
Remind me, what's the story
with Mr. Hyperventilation?

18:00.208 --> 18:01.041
Come on.

18:01.042 --> 18:03.218
You yesterday when he come in.

18:03.219 --> 18:04.052
Funny.

18:04.053 --> 18:07.547
Come on now, what's the story again?

18:07.548 --> 18:09.869
He used to live around here.

18:09.870 --> 18:12.434
Well seems to live here now.

18:12.435 --> 18:16.494
Seeing as how he's always
riding by on his bike peeking.

18:16.495 --> 18:18.281
He's been back a while.

18:18.282 --> 18:19.725
Yeah.

18:19.726 --> 18:23.209
So how come he ain't been in
here to eat until yesterday?

18:23.210 --> 18:24.877
Maybe he eats somewhere else.

18:24.878 --> 18:25.711
Like where?

18:25.712 --> 18:26.763
Julies?

18:26.764 --> 18:29.734
Come on you can catch something
sitting on a bar stool.

18:29.735 --> 18:30.735
Gross.

18:34.382 --> 18:36.439
His name name is Gabe Dunham.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.302
He was a couple years
ahead of me in school.

18:38.303 --> 18:40.763
Mmm, did you guys uh?

18:40.764 --> 18:42.012
I was 14.

18:42.013 --> 18:43.013
So?

18:43.694 --> 18:44.527
JD...

18:44.528 --> 18:46.729
I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

18:46.730 --> 18:49.063
But this was first love huh?

18:50.888 --> 18:52.305
So what happened?

18:53.786 --> 18:55.036
He moved away

18:56.462 --> 18:58.295
when his parents died.

19:01.375 --> 19:04.943
You think he moved back because of you?

19:04.944 --> 19:08.861
I think Willard and
Carlene need their check.

19:11.608 --> 19:15.025
Must be almost time for Judge Judy huh?

19:17.376 --> 19:18.376
Alright.

20:26.915 --> 20:28.582
What do you think?

20:30.315 --> 20:31.966
About what?

20:31.967 --> 20:33.828
Is it ready or not?

20:33.829 --> 20:37.540
I figured you were checking my work.

20:37.541 --> 20:38.708
Looks ready.

20:40.717 --> 20:43.348
Yeah, glad to hear it.

20:43.349 --> 20:44.442
Tires?

20:44.443 --> 20:47.943
They feeling alright, they got enough air?

20:51.581 --> 20:52.831
They're good.

20:54.146 --> 20:55.146
Good.

20:57.573 --> 21:00.682
You wanna take it for a spin?

21:00.683 --> 21:03.385
Just to be sure and all.

21:03.386 --> 21:06.055
I don't know, think it needs it?

21:06.056 --> 21:07.332
Maybe.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.004
I could use another opinion.

21:10.005 --> 21:13.154
So I just ride it around to...

21:13.155 --> 21:15.822
Test it, check my work.

21:16.837 --> 21:19.569
Okay, I guess I could.

21:19.570 --> 21:20.570
If you want.

21:21.754 --> 21:22.754
Okay then.

21:58.177 --> 22:00.165
Angel, come on, we gotta go now.

22:00.166 --> 22:01.480
Whose bike is that?

22:01.481 --> 22:02.573
It's our bike.

22:02.574 --> 22:03.596
Is not.

22:03.597 --> 22:05.373
A guy gave it to us.

22:05.374 --> 22:06.605
What guy?

22:06.606 --> 22:08.733
Where's your stuff, we need to go now.

22:08.734 --> 22:10.481
Are we taking the bicycle back?

22:10.482 --> 22:12.359
No, we need it.

22:12.360 --> 22:13.549
That's stealing.

22:13.550 --> 22:14.992
It's not stealing if you need something

22:14.993 --> 22:16.685
more than somebody else does.

22:16.686 --> 22:17.776
That's the golden rule.

22:17.777 --> 22:18.659
Is not.

22:18.660 --> 22:19.542
Is too.

22:19.543 --> 22:20.933
Is not.

22:20.934 --> 22:24.023
You know, you're a pain
in the ass sometimes.

22:24.024 --> 22:27.509
You're not supposed
to say that word.

22:27.510 --> 22:29.608
Fine, I'll take the bike back.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.441
I'll go to.

22:56.032 --> 22:59.003
Hey, you're back already.

22:59.004 --> 23:00.037
How'd it ride?

23:00.038 --> 23:01.579
Rode good.

23:01.580 --> 23:02.892
Need any others checked?

23:02.893 --> 23:04.379
I was just wondering if maybe

23:04.380 --> 23:07.582
you could use some help
with stuff like that?

23:07.583 --> 23:08.803
Checking bikes.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.637
Sure, I got a big need for that.

23:13.198 --> 23:15.803
Well, I could do other things too.

23:15.804 --> 23:16.949
Fix stuff.

23:16.950 --> 23:18.950
Oh you mean like be my assistant?

23:18.951 --> 23:20.451
Yeah, like that.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.475
Do I have to pay you?

23:23.476 --> 23:25.782
Nah, I got lots of money.

23:25.783 --> 23:27.843
You could maybe give me food.

23:27.844 --> 23:28.844
Yeah?

23:29.692 --> 23:31.483
What kind of food?

23:31.484 --> 23:36.324
Good food, like not stuff
from the gas station store.

23:36.325 --> 23:39.894
Not stuff from the gas station store.

23:39.895 --> 23:41.294
Got it.

23:41.295 --> 23:44.766
I mean what would you
do for this good food?

23:44.767 --> 23:48.266
I could help you check stuff, fix bikes.

23:48.267 --> 23:50.534
You know how to fix bikes?

23:50.535 --> 23:52.214
I used to have one.

23:52.215 --> 23:53.684
Did you fix it?

23:53.685 --> 23:56.011
Yeah all the time.

23:56.012 --> 23:58.038
Sounds like you'd be
a big help to me then.

23:58.039 --> 23:59.774
What's your name?

23:59.775 --> 24:00.775
Tevin.

24:01.702 --> 24:03.535
You got a last name?

24:04.860 --> 24:08.958
As your employer I have
to know these things.

24:08.959 --> 24:10.376
Day, Tevin Day.

24:12.278 --> 24:15.028
Well Tevin Day, Gabriel Dunham.

24:16.448 --> 24:19.115
Call me Gabe, all my friends do.

24:20.690 --> 24:22.693
Well you being a working man and all,

24:22.694 --> 24:24.638
I'm sure you have a
social security number.

24:24.639 --> 24:26.056
Yeah of course.

24:27.397 --> 24:28.883
What is it?

24:28.884 --> 24:30.659
Why you wanna know?

24:30.660 --> 24:33.458
I have to have it for my records.

24:33.459 --> 24:36.313
Don't worry, I'm not gonna tell anybody.

24:36.314 --> 24:37.397
Okay, well,

24:40.461 --> 24:41.461
it's 12.

24:42.671 --> 24:43.671
12.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.628
Ah, that's a low one.

24:47.629 --> 24:48.931
One of the good ones.

24:48.932 --> 24:52.099
You must be a pretty important person.

24:53.837 --> 24:56.196
Is your dad famous or something?

24:56.197 --> 24:57.372
Yeah kind of.

24:57.373 --> 24:58.373
He was

25:00.267 --> 25:02.017
a general in the FBI.

25:03.166 --> 25:04.166
Ah, well,

25:06.165 --> 25:07.239
that explains it.

25:07.240 --> 25:10.711
Those guys get all the good numbers.

25:10.712 --> 25:13.258
So when do you wanna start working for me?

25:13.259 --> 25:15.863
How 'bout tomorrow morning?

25:15.864 --> 25:17.420
Don't you have school?

25:17.421 --> 25:18.414
Oh yeah.

25:18.415 --> 25:19.996
Tomorrow after school.

25:19.997 --> 25:21.310
So you live around here then?

25:21.311 --> 25:22.541
Not too far.

25:22.542 --> 25:25.204
I'm surprised I've
never seen you before.

25:25.205 --> 25:26.994
We just moved here.

25:26.995 --> 25:28.710
We?

25:28.711 --> 25:30.397
My family.

25:30.398 --> 25:31.398
Oh.

25:32.370 --> 25:33.370
Well,

25:34.778 --> 25:36.598
yeah I just moved back here myself.

25:36.599 --> 25:39.581
I used to live here when I was a kid.

25:39.582 --> 25:40.582
My father,

25:41.890 --> 25:44.723
he used to fix my bike right here.

25:46.724 --> 25:49.183
When I wasn't riding my
bike or shooting hoops

25:49.184 --> 25:51.857
I was just hanging around
the tree outside back.

25:51.858 --> 25:56.142
Me and my brother practically
lived in that thing.

25:56.143 --> 25:59.025
It just sits there now, nobody uses it.

25:59.026 --> 26:01.557
Not your brother either?

26:01.558 --> 26:03.069
No.

26:03.070 --> 26:04.903
Not my brother either.

26:06.294 --> 26:09.127
Okay well, see ya tomorrow then.

26:10.393 --> 26:13.585
Hey, you want some
of that good food now?

26:13.586 --> 26:15.055
Yeah, sure.

26:15.056 --> 26:16.565
I guess that'll be okay.

26:16.566 --> 26:17.870
Well if you're gonna be going to school

26:17.871 --> 26:19.173
and working for me, you're probably

26:19.174 --> 26:21.145
gonna need some energy.

26:21.146 --> 26:23.623
That's good thinking.

26:23.624 --> 26:25.583
Alright then.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.741
Come to the house.

26:27.742 --> 26:29.489
Where's your car?

26:29.490 --> 26:31.661
It's in a junkyard in
New York.

26:31.662 --> 26:32.964
So you just ride bikes?

26:32.965 --> 26:34.167
Yeah I get better mileage that way.

26:34.168 --> 26:35.149
You shoot hoops?

26:35.150 --> 26:37.316
Not in a long long time.

26:41.628 --> 26:44.567
You strike me as a guy
with a big appetite.

26:44.568 --> 26:46.292
Think you can handle two sandwiches?

26:46.293 --> 26:47.159
Yeah, I'm a big eater.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.973
Practically always eat two of everything.

26:49.974 --> 26:51.307
Is that right?

27:09.111 --> 27:11.461
Maybe only put tomatoes on one.

27:11.462 --> 27:14.695
I don't wanna overeat
on a tomato you know?

27:14.696 --> 27:16.894
That's good thinking.

27:16.895 --> 27:21.895
Are you sure your parents
won't mind you working for me?

27:22.200 --> 27:23.797
Maybe I should give them a call.

27:23.798 --> 27:25.074
What's their number?

27:25.075 --> 27:26.642
They're never home.

27:26.643 --> 27:28.139
Never?

27:28.140 --> 27:30.379
They're at their job a lot.

27:30.380 --> 27:32.435
They work really hard.

27:32.436 --> 27:34.986
I hope that runs in the family.

27:34.987 --> 27:39.925
I guess I found myself a
good assistant bicycle fixer.

27:39.926 --> 27:42.176
You got any toilet paper?

28:29.195 --> 28:30.228
Yes, I'd like the number for anyone

28:30.229 --> 28:33.646
with the last name of Day in Ponchatoula.

28:35.379 --> 28:38.683
What about any towns close by?

28:38.684 --> 28:40.853
This got mixed in with
some of my CMH paperwork.

28:40.854 --> 28:42.354
One of yours.

28:42.355 --> 28:44.105
Oh yeah, Mazey Day.

28:48.132 --> 28:49.067
Wait a second.

28:49.068 --> 28:50.757
Wait, this was two days ago.

28:50.758 --> 28:52.157
Where are her kids?

28:52.158 --> 28:54.523
Can't help you there honey.

28:54.524 --> 28:56.735
Okay well give Beth a hug for me.

28:56.736 --> 28:57.736
Okay.

29:20.242 --> 29:23.909
I'll be with you in
a minute, take a seat.

29:28.474 --> 29:29.474
Well.

29:30.171 --> 29:31.611
Young Mr. Dunham.

29:31.612 --> 29:33.698
I'm not so young anymore.

29:33.699 --> 29:34.600
I knew you were in town.

29:34.601 --> 29:35.502
I saw you on your bicycle.

29:35.503 --> 29:36.335
And at the diner.

29:36.336 --> 29:38.971
Give sage advice on pie.

29:38.972 --> 29:41.930
I understand you're staying
out at your parents house.

29:41.931 --> 29:43.692
You know a lot of things.

29:43.693 --> 29:45.443
Well it is my town.

29:46.706 --> 29:49.866
That house sitting empty, it was sad.

29:49.867 --> 29:50.867
Yeah.

29:52.011 --> 29:54.306
So what brings you back?

29:54.307 --> 29:57.552
Just seeing if I left
anything behind, maybe.

29:57.553 --> 29:58.842
Or anyone.

29:58.843 --> 29:59.843
Maybe.

30:02.308 --> 30:03.617
Coffee?

30:03.618 --> 30:04.618
No.

30:05.477 --> 30:07.477
Good call, it's awful.

30:10.652 --> 30:12.577
So listen Chief Tate...

30:12.578 --> 30:14.996
Oh, just plain old Tate is fine.

30:14.997 --> 30:16.508
It's what everybody else calls me.

30:16.509 --> 30:17.600
Except my ex-wife.

30:17.601 --> 30:18.650
What does she call you?

30:18.651 --> 30:20.984
Long-distance, preferably.

30:22.795 --> 30:24.994
I'm sorry, what were you gonna say?

30:24.995 --> 30:27.092
I have kind of a funny question.

30:27.093 --> 30:28.260
Funny ha ha?

30:29.139 --> 30:31.445
Well that's too bad.

30:31.446 --> 30:33.559
Go ahead, shoot.

30:33.560 --> 30:34.708
I'm just curious if anybody's called

30:34.709 --> 30:36.376
on any missing kids.

30:37.312 --> 30:38.145
Missing kids, what,

30:38.146 --> 30:39.645
what missing kids?

30:41.148 --> 30:42.967
I don't know that there are any,

30:42.968 --> 30:44.676
I'm just asking.

30:44.677 --> 30:45.725
Well you're right about one thing,

30:45.726 --> 30:48.499
that is a funny question.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.683
I saw a couple of kids
walking outside of town.

30:50.684 --> 30:51.995
Past them on my bike.

30:51.996 --> 30:53.651
Just curious if they were
missing from somewhere

30:53.652 --> 30:55.820
or run away from home,
something like that.

30:55.821 --> 30:57.205
And why would you think that?

30:57.206 --> 30:59.373
I didn't recognize them.

31:02.174 --> 31:03.268
Well why don't you describe them for me.

31:03.269 --> 31:04.751
What did they look like?

31:04.752 --> 31:06.025
I only saw them for a couple seconds,

31:06.026 --> 31:07.383
didn't really get a good look.

31:07.384 --> 31:11.585
So how is it that you know
you don't recognize them?

31:11.586 --> 31:13.234
I don't know.

31:13.235 --> 31:15.000
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

31:15.001 --> 31:16.836
Maybe you just stopped by to say hello.

31:16.837 --> 31:18.432
I guess that's it.

31:18.433 --> 31:20.096
Well hello.

31:20.097 --> 31:22.071
And goodbye.

31:22.072 --> 31:23.456
Gabe.

31:23.457 --> 31:25.292
You don't mind if I call you Gabe do you?

31:25.293 --> 31:27.069
Well that's what
everybody else calls me.

31:27.070 --> 31:28.737
Except your ex-wife.

31:29.729 --> 31:33.396
You know that was
very nearly funny ha ha.

31:35.625 --> 31:36.993
I wonder if you'd do me a favor.

31:36.994 --> 31:38.786
Next time you see those
kids, ask them for me

31:38.787 --> 31:40.701
if they happen to be missing.

31:40.702 --> 31:43.668
Or you can just get a better look at them.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.797
You see that would help
somebody around here

31:45.798 --> 31:48.465
do their job a whole lot easier.

31:55.281 --> 31:58.364
Be careful out there on that bicycle.

32:05.738 --> 32:07.279
Hello, what you want?

32:07.280 --> 32:09.590
I'm looking for Mazey Day's children.

32:09.591 --> 32:10.424
And who are you?

32:10.425 --> 32:13.872
Glynnis Harmon, County Social Services.

32:13.873 --> 32:15.593
And who might you be?

32:15.594 --> 32:17.038
What's it to you?

32:17.039 --> 32:18.979
Well, the rental agency has Mazey's name

32:18.980 --> 32:20.747
on record at this address.

32:20.748 --> 32:22.151
Yeah, well I'm the one paying the rent

32:22.152 --> 32:23.303
for the last couple of months,

32:23.304 --> 32:26.217
and Mazey, well, she ain't coming back.

32:26.218 --> 32:28.363
I'm sorry for your loss.

32:28.364 --> 32:30.793
And I need to see Tevin and Angel Day.

32:30.794 --> 32:32.054
Well they ain't here.

32:32.055 --> 32:33.411
Where are they?

32:33.412 --> 32:34.498
How should I know?

32:34.499 --> 32:36.045
Do you think we can go inside?

32:36.046 --> 32:37.046
No.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.906
I simply need to
verify that the children

32:40.907 --> 32:42.507
are not on the premises.

32:42.508 --> 32:45.797
I told you, they ain't here.

32:45.798 --> 32:47.965
Shall I call the police?

32:51.362 --> 32:53.777
They run away a couple
days ago, alright?

32:53.778 --> 32:56.111
Same day as when Mazey died.

32:57.044 --> 32:59.109
And you didn't notify anyone

32:59.110 --> 33:01.681
of the children's disappearance?

33:01.682 --> 33:02.981
I didn't say they disappeared lady,

33:02.982 --> 33:04.749
I said they run off.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.403
Okay, so you're telling me that an

33:06.404 --> 33:09.457
11-year-old boy and a five-year-old girl

33:09.458 --> 33:11.319
have been missing for two nights

33:11.320 --> 33:13.797
and you didn't even call the police?

33:13.798 --> 33:16.381
Hey lady, they ain't my kids.

33:18.090 --> 33:20.141
Do you have any photographs of them?

33:20.142 --> 33:21.534
What for?

33:21.535 --> 33:23.833
Because that might help us find them.

33:23.834 --> 33:26.066
You know, you never can tell,

33:26.067 --> 33:28.777
there may be a reward in it for you.

33:28.778 --> 33:29.861
Yeah right.

33:31.571 --> 33:32.571
Wait here.

33:43.286 --> 33:46.619
When you find 'em, I wanna see that boy.

33:47.654 --> 33:49.654
Kid stole money from me.

33:53.450 --> 33:55.033
Thanks.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.056
Morning.

34:15.056 --> 34:17.056
It's afternoon.

34:18.088 --> 34:19.934
Who's tending to the customers?

34:19.935 --> 34:21.297
Lunch crowd's gone.

34:21.297 --> 34:23.324
I think my minions can manage for a while.

34:23.326 --> 34:25.442
Wow, you got minions?

34:25.443 --> 34:27.693
Oh yeah, minions, onions,

34:28.810 --> 34:30.726
I've got lots of stuff.

34:32.474 --> 34:34.141
It's good to see you.

34:34.141 --> 34:35.141
Is it?

34:38.949 --> 34:40.277
Yeah.

34:40.277 --> 34:41.277
It is.

34:42.252 --> 34:43.646
I just realized something.

34:43.647 --> 34:46.011
I've always known where this place was

34:46.012 --> 34:48.844
but I've never actually been here.

34:50.001 --> 34:51.221
So no one's been living here the entire

34:51.222 --> 34:52.804
time you were gone?

34:54.966 --> 34:56.241
It's hard to believe.

34:56.242 --> 34:58.558
It looks really good fixed up.

34:58.559 --> 34:59.559
Lived in.

35:02.783 --> 35:03.783
Thanks.

35:05.442 --> 35:08.104
Yeah I've had a lot of time on my hands.

35:08.105 --> 35:10.004
Is this finished?

35:10.005 --> 35:12.172
It's a work in progress.

35:14.789 --> 35:16.675
I am getting tired of having to

35:16.676 --> 35:20.093
lock the bikes in the cellar every night.

35:24.018 --> 35:26.101
How long you been back?

35:29.234 --> 35:31.324
Four months maybe.

35:31.325 --> 35:32.325
Five.

35:37.346 --> 35:39.513
I didn't know what to say.

35:41.076 --> 35:43.558
It's been a long time.

35:43.559 --> 35:45.642
So why'd you come back?

35:46.952 --> 35:48.702
You just disappeared.

35:50.020 --> 35:51.687
It wasn't my idea.

35:54.985 --> 35:59.171
I never got a chance to
tell you how sorry I was.

35:59.172 --> 36:00.755
About your parents.

36:05.308 --> 36:07.062
I heard you got married.

36:07.063 --> 36:08.504
You heard huh?

36:08.505 --> 36:09.752
Yeah.

36:09.753 --> 36:12.029
It's in the street.

36:12.030 --> 36:13.939
Well that didn't take.

36:17.123 --> 36:18.123
Kids?

36:20.318 --> 36:22.814
Looks like you've got a customer.

36:22.815 --> 36:24.984
Ah it's just a friend.

36:24.985 --> 36:26.652
Maybe I should go.

36:27.598 --> 36:29.265
You just got here.

36:30.591 --> 36:32.924
Well that makes one of us.

36:55.055 --> 36:57.110
Who was that?

36:57.111 --> 36:59.194
That was an old friend.

37:00.321 --> 37:01.321
Tevin right?

37:03.091 --> 37:06.674
Wasn't sure you were
serious about working.

37:07.598 --> 37:11.982
What is this, like a
thousand dollar bill?

37:11.983 --> 37:13.400
It's a million.

37:15.321 --> 37:16.893
You should keep this thing in a safe.

37:16.894 --> 37:19.181
I would if it were real.

37:19.182 --> 37:20.454
Oh.

37:20.455 --> 37:21.952
You can have it if you want.

37:21.953 --> 37:22.953
Yeah?

37:30.734 --> 37:32.067
What's it say?

37:36.302 --> 37:39.469
"Here's the million dollar question.

37:40.576 --> 37:43.159
"What is the worth of your soul

37:44.060 --> 37:45.477
"if you haven't...

37:47.569 --> 37:49.179
Accepted.

37:49.180 --> 37:51.353
"Accepted, if you haven't accepted Jesus

37:51.354 --> 37:53.354
"Christ as your savior."

37:54.332 --> 37:56.415
So what's soul exactly?

37:57.504 --> 38:00.987
It's some really good
music from a long time ago.

38:00.988 --> 38:01.988
Huh?

38:03.941 --> 38:06.191
Well in this case it's...

38:07.529 --> 38:09.279
Well let me see that.

38:12.871 --> 38:14.454
Read it out loud.

38:17.446 --> 38:19.717
"And again I say to you,

38:19.718 --> 38:22.802
"It is easier for a camel to go through

38:22.803 --> 38:24.283
"the eye of a needle than it is for a

38:24.284 --> 38:27.561
"rich man to enter the kingdom of God."

38:27.562 --> 38:29.292
Oh ha ha, that's crazy.

38:29.293 --> 38:30.126
A camel?

38:30.127 --> 38:31.512
I've seen pictures of those things.

38:31.513 --> 38:34.464
It's like bigger than a horse.

38:34.465 --> 38:35.958
Something that big is supposed to

38:35.959 --> 38:38.364
fit through someones eye?

38:38.365 --> 38:40.115
Is that what it says?

38:47.337 --> 38:49.587
So you don't get it either.

38:50.845 --> 38:52.571
It basically means that

38:52.572 --> 38:53.652
if all you wanna do is make money

38:53.653 --> 38:55.666
you aren't gonna get into heaven.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.667
Oh, right.

38:57.515 --> 38:58.734
Heaven.

38:58.735 --> 39:01.101
They talk about that at Sunday School.

39:01.102 --> 39:02.804
You go to Sunday School?

39:02.805 --> 39:05.555
Nah, it's for like little kids.

39:07.588 --> 39:10.255
My sister has a friend who goes.

39:11.829 --> 39:13.530
She believes in all that stuff.

39:13.531 --> 39:14.740
But you don't?

39:14.741 --> 39:17.519
Of course not, do you?

39:17.520 --> 39:18.770
I don't know.

39:20.343 --> 39:23.046
I don't know, I used to.

39:23.047 --> 39:25.071
When you were a little kid?

39:25.072 --> 39:27.310
And when I was growing
up for a little while too.

39:27.311 --> 39:29.636
Isn't that like
believing in Santa Claus?

39:29.637 --> 39:31.559
What, you don't believe
in Santa Claus either?

39:31.560 --> 39:33.860
Give me a break.

39:33.861 --> 39:36.028
So what's this word again?

39:37.073 --> 39:38.073
Savior.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.090
That's like a hero right?

39:41.989 --> 39:45.510
Someone who saves you from drowning.

39:45.511 --> 39:46.844
Yeah, sort of.

39:48.212 --> 39:51.268
Jesus Christ, he's supposed
to be God's kid right?

39:51.269 --> 39:52.686
Supposed to be.

39:53.765 --> 39:56.265
And he died a long time ago.

39:57.572 --> 39:59.966
That's what they say.

39:59.967 --> 40:02.967
So how is he supposed to save you?

40:07.663 --> 40:08.913
I don't know.

40:11.109 --> 40:14.776
Hey, I think that bike's
ready to be tested.

40:18.945 --> 40:22.014
Only it doesn't have a basket.

40:22.015 --> 40:23.546
You know, if you have a lot of stuff.

40:23.547 --> 40:24.547
Oh yeah.

40:25.939 --> 40:29.049
Well, did a little
more work this morning.

40:29.050 --> 40:32.192
On the one you rode yesterday

40:32.193 --> 40:33.714
with the basket.

40:33.715 --> 40:36.215
I can ride that one.

40:38.567 --> 40:39.567
Go ahead.

40:51.573 --> 40:53.783
Glynnis, Glynnis.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.124
What fair wind of fortune blows you

40:55.125 --> 40:56.813
into my office today?

40:56.814 --> 40:58.764
Oh Tate, if it were only

40:58.765 --> 41:01.441
for the food and the poetic license.

41:01.442 --> 41:05.525
If only you hadn't
revoked that poetic license.

41:07.121 --> 41:08.704
Once upon a time.

41:09.603 --> 41:11.186
Once upon a time.

41:12.167 --> 41:13.830
So I've got a situation.

41:13.831 --> 41:14.677
Of course you do.

41:14.678 --> 41:15.793
I'm all ears.

41:15.794 --> 41:16.794
Hardly.

41:20.641 --> 41:21.904
Thank you.

41:21.905 --> 41:24.951
So one of my cases OD'd
a couple of days ago

41:24.952 --> 41:26.610
and her kids are missing.

41:26.611 --> 41:28.026
Now the guy who lives in her place

41:28.027 --> 41:30.626
said that they ran off.

41:30.627 --> 41:31.978
How old are the kids?

41:31.979 --> 41:33.563
11 and five.

41:33.564 --> 41:34.967
And no one from your department called

41:34.968 --> 41:37.126
my office when Medic one got her in.

41:37.127 --> 41:38.478
Ouch.

41:38.479 --> 41:40.129
Who responded the call?

41:40.130 --> 41:41.130
No, Nugent.

41:43.471 --> 41:45.388
Yeah, sorry about that.

41:46.889 --> 41:48.449
Is this that woman out in Roscoe,

41:48.450 --> 41:50.165
what was it, last week, Tuesday?

41:50.166 --> 41:50.998
Yeah.

41:50.999 --> 41:51.895
And no one in county has any idea

41:51.896 --> 41:53.312
where these kids are.

41:53.313 --> 41:56.755
So I talked to Trailways,
I checked with Truck Ranch

41:56.756 --> 41:58.616
to see if maybe they hitched a ride

41:58.617 --> 42:01.534
and no one has seen any loose kids.

42:08.078 --> 42:09.078
What?

42:12.539 --> 42:13.539
Oh.

42:14.838 --> 42:15.891
Somebody came into my office today and

42:15.892 --> 42:18.245
was asking me questions
about missing children.

42:18.246 --> 42:19.078
Really?

42:19.079 --> 42:19.912
Really.

42:19.913 --> 42:23.146
Said he'd seen a couple of
kids, he didn't recognize 'em.

42:23.147 --> 42:24.654
And that's it?

42:24.655 --> 42:27.082
And he came to see you?

42:27.083 --> 42:28.138
Don't sound so shocked.

42:28.139 --> 42:31.841
You know, some people actually
like to see me Glynnis.

42:31.842 --> 42:33.103
Okay, well I need to find out what

42:33.104 --> 42:35.079
this guy knows about these kids.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.913
So do you have a name and address?

42:36.914 --> 42:38.147
Yes I do.

42:38.148 --> 42:39.498
Go.

42:39.499 --> 42:40.785
Dunham.

42:40.786 --> 42:42.723
He lives on the east side off of Rimrod.

42:42.724 --> 42:43.659
Can't miss his house.

42:43.660 --> 42:46.113
Turned the whole front
yard into a bike shop.

42:46.114 --> 42:47.989
Gabriel Dunham.

42:47.990 --> 42:50.651
Parents died in a car accident
when he was in high school.

42:50.652 --> 42:52.186
And he wasn't in the car with them.

42:52.187 --> 42:53.670
Right.

42:53.671 --> 42:54.942
But his younger brother was.

42:54.943 --> 42:55.790
You know the case.

42:55.791 --> 42:57.321
I do.

42:57.322 --> 42:59.141
I had to place the boys

42:59.142 --> 43:02.029
and it didn't turn out well.

43:02.030 --> 43:03.530
They got split up.

43:04.626 --> 43:08.670
So I guess I will be heading
out to see Mr. Dunham.

43:08.671 --> 43:09.504
If you shall happen to find yourself

43:09.505 --> 43:12.921
in need of a police escort, I'm your man.

43:13.886 --> 43:14.878
He got it.

43:14.879 --> 43:15.871
Thanks.

43:48.064 --> 43:51.159
Dale, you still looking for that boy?

43:51.160 --> 43:53.160
I think I just seen him.

44:51.274 --> 44:52.805
Alright, where's he at?

44:52.806 --> 44:54.626
Don't know, bike's gone.

44:54.627 --> 44:55.977
You ran over his bike dummy.

44:55.978 --> 44:57.135
Do you remember?

44:57.136 --> 44:58.459
Oh yeah, that's right.

44:58.460 --> 44:59.681
He scratched my truck.

44:59.682 --> 45:01.532
How 'bout you just
don't be wasting my time

45:01.533 --> 45:02.700
seeing things.

45:04.170 --> 45:06.405
Yeah, then who's the
little turd I see over there?

45:24.204 --> 45:25.659
Well well, will you look and see

45:25.660 --> 45:28.244
what just crawled out
from underneath a rock.

45:28.245 --> 45:30.027
Why don't you do me a favor Dilbert,

45:30.028 --> 45:32.599
go play in the streets
of somebody elses town.

45:32.600 --> 45:34.537
Nobody calls me Dilbert

45:34.538 --> 45:39.231
Oh, that's right 'cause
that's the comic strip right?

45:39.232 --> 45:43.565
Then how come it is that
you're not making me laugh?

45:47.070 --> 45:47.903
I see your customer
base is getting younger

45:47.904 --> 45:50.113
and younger every day.

45:50.114 --> 45:53.309
Ah, you got a little
something there on your neck.

45:53.310 --> 45:54.585
That's funny.

45:54.586 --> 45:56.127
You're a funny man.

45:56.128 --> 45:57.368
Yeah I am aren't I?

45:57.369 --> 46:00.201
I'm a funny man, I'll be here all week.

46:00.202 --> 46:03.535
Why don't you see to it that you're not.

46:38.353 --> 46:39.353
Well well.

46:40.499 --> 46:42.086
Been a long time Gabriel.

46:42.087 --> 46:44.426
Yeah, not long enough.

46:44.427 --> 46:45.594
How are you?

46:47.221 --> 46:49.040
Look, there was a lot of things

46:49.041 --> 46:50.740
that happened a long time ago.

46:50.741 --> 46:52.808
I did not come here to start...

46:52.809 --> 46:53.642
To what?

46:53.643 --> 46:55.681
Open old wounds?

46:55.682 --> 46:57.228
I'm here about something else.

46:57.229 --> 47:00.116
What could we possibly
have to talk about?

47:00.117 --> 47:02.428
I'm looking for two missing kids.

47:02.429 --> 47:04.550
Well I don't have them.

47:04.551 --> 47:07.722
And if I did I certainly
wouldn't give them to you.

47:07.723 --> 47:10.620
I did everything I could Gabriel.

47:10.621 --> 47:12.766
Look, I was so young.

47:12.767 --> 47:15.418
I was basically an intern.

47:15.419 --> 47:17.169
It was my first case.

47:18.822 --> 47:20.538
We tried to keep you guys together

47:20.539 --> 47:24.074
it just, it just didn't work out.

47:24.075 --> 47:25.426
Not for Jerry they didn't.

47:25.427 --> 47:27.094
No, not for Jerry.

47:29.861 --> 47:31.944
May I ask how he's doing.

47:32.943 --> 47:35.740
You can ask all you want.

47:35.741 --> 47:37.702
Listen, Tate said that you saw some

47:37.703 --> 47:40.872
kids that you thought might be runaways.

47:40.873 --> 47:42.540
I didn't say that.

47:43.579 --> 47:45.746
Do they look like these?

47:47.285 --> 47:49.756
I couldn't tell ya.

47:49.757 --> 47:52.068
Well you know, I really
would like to find them.

47:52.069 --> 47:53.736
They're mother died.

47:55.553 --> 47:57.764
Is that why they ran away?

47:57.765 --> 48:00.102
You know, I don't even think they know.

48:00.103 --> 48:01.436
How'd she die?

48:02.653 --> 48:05.002
It was drug related.

48:05.003 --> 48:07.696
It was a really bad home situation.

48:07.697 --> 48:09.592
I think they left because of that

48:09.593 --> 48:11.676
the day before yesterday.

48:13.143 --> 48:14.766
Grandparents?

48:14.767 --> 48:16.404
Aunts?

48:16.405 --> 48:17.238
Uncles?

48:17.239 --> 48:19.406
No, there's no one.

48:19.407 --> 48:21.382
They have nowhere to go.

48:21.383 --> 48:24.048
And you're gonna come to their rescue?

48:24.049 --> 48:27.234
No, I'm gonna try to help them.

48:27.235 --> 48:30.235
Like you helped me and my brother?

48:31.201 --> 48:33.138
I only wanna help Gabriel.

48:33.139 --> 48:34.698
That is the truth.

48:34.699 --> 48:37.454
Whether you believe it or not.

48:37.455 --> 48:40.622
Look, if you see them, please call me.

48:48.427 --> 48:49.427
Thank you.

49:08.031 --> 49:09.364
There you are.

49:11.058 --> 49:13.148
I thought you left town or something.

49:13.149 --> 49:14.751
Who was that lady?

49:14.752 --> 49:16.284
Nobody.

49:16.285 --> 49:17.442
Just a customer.

49:17.443 --> 49:19.078
Yeah, so we have a bike to fix?

49:19.079 --> 49:20.496
No, she didn't.

49:21.485 --> 49:23.474
She'll be back.

49:23.475 --> 49:24.902
When?

49:24.903 --> 49:26.320
Does it matter?

49:27.515 --> 49:29.374
She was here about a bike?

49:29.375 --> 49:30.636
Yeah.

49:30.637 --> 49:31.637
I quit.

49:34.055 --> 49:34.953
Is that right?

49:34.954 --> 49:36.758
Any particular reason?

49:36.759 --> 49:39.320
I ain't working for no liar.

49:39.321 --> 49:41.934
What are you talking about?

49:41.935 --> 49:43.546
I've seen that lady before.

49:43.547 --> 49:45.781
She ain't got no bike.

49:45.782 --> 49:47.324
No she doesn't.

49:47.325 --> 49:49.935
It's just somebody I used to know.

49:49.936 --> 49:51.977
Sure got a lot of old friends.

49:51.978 --> 49:54.057
She isn't my friend.

49:54.058 --> 49:56.345
And it was from a long time ago,

49:56.346 --> 50:00.168
back from when I was maybe,
a few years older than you.

50:00.169 --> 50:02.443
After my parents died.

50:02.444 --> 50:04.807
So you consider yourself a lucky man?

50:04.808 --> 50:06.975
Luckier than my brother.

50:08.761 --> 50:09.696
That's the first time you've mentioned

50:09.697 --> 50:11.113
Jerry in a while.

50:11.956 --> 50:13.411
Have you heard from him?

50:13.412 --> 50:14.412
No.

50:15.336 --> 50:16.857
Where is he living now?

50:16.858 --> 50:19.169
It doesn't matter.

50:19.170 --> 50:22.174
It's a bad place wherever he is.

50:22.175 --> 50:24.008
My father saw to that.

50:26.076 --> 50:30.401
And then the foster parents
were worse than he was.

50:30.402 --> 50:31.402
And...

50:33.257 --> 50:34.706
Don't stop there.

50:34.707 --> 50:35.707
And what?

50:38.750 --> 50:40.083
You were saying.

50:40.920 --> 50:44.337
Foster parents as bad as your father was?

50:45.783 --> 50:47.366
Worse, way worse.

50:48.441 --> 50:50.022
And?

50:50.023 --> 50:53.366
And I wasn't there to help him.

50:53.367 --> 50:55.110
That wasn't your fault.

50:55.111 --> 50:56.590
You were placed in different homes.

50:56.591 --> 50:59.008
This shouldn't of happened.

51:01.687 --> 51:04.210
You can't change what was Gabe.

51:04.211 --> 51:06.961
You can only change what will be.

51:07.955 --> 51:10.578
Parents died when you were a kid?

51:10.579 --> 51:11.579
That sucks.

51:12.621 --> 51:14.218
Yes.

51:14.219 --> 51:15.469
It surely does.

51:17.169 --> 51:18.936
Got any brothers or sisters?

51:18.937 --> 51:20.472
Brother.

51:20.473 --> 51:21.461
What about you?

51:21.462 --> 51:22.461
Sister.

51:23.409 --> 51:24.760
Listen, you mind if I come back

51:24.761 --> 51:28.064
and help you with the
bikes a little bit later?

51:28.065 --> 51:30.754
I got some stuff I gotta get home.

51:30.755 --> 51:33.390
Oh sure, no problem.

51:33.391 --> 51:35.552
Well hey, you want some of that food now?

51:35.553 --> 51:37.216
I guess.

51:37.217 --> 51:38.217
Will it fit?

51:40.515 --> 51:42.534
It's not a four course meal.

51:42.535 --> 51:43.872
Just some sandwiches I made earlier,

51:43.873 --> 51:45.068
some mac and cheese.

51:45.069 --> 51:46.330
It's really good cold.

51:46.331 --> 51:49.272
Okay sure, thanks.

51:49.273 --> 51:51.631
Hey, you think maybe your family

51:51.632 --> 51:54.105
would like to come over
for dinner sometime?

51:54.106 --> 51:56.158
I don't know.

51:56.159 --> 51:57.702
Well maybe just you and your sister

51:57.703 --> 51:59.875
could come over to dinner.

51:59.876 --> 52:01.708
When your parents are working late.

52:01.709 --> 52:03.376
Like when?

52:04.479 --> 52:06.378
How 'bout tonight?

52:06.379 --> 52:07.883
Okay I guess.

52:07.884 --> 52:08.884
Come on.

52:11.460 --> 52:12.349
Here ya go.

52:12.350 --> 52:13.294
Thank you.

52:13.295 --> 52:14.240
Thank you.

52:15.825 --> 52:18.492
Somebody's becoming a regular.

52:23.275 --> 52:25.420
I hear the pecan pie's really good here.

52:25.421 --> 52:27.732
So they tell me.

52:27.733 --> 52:28.710
I'd like one.

52:28.711 --> 52:29.826
You want a piece of pie?

52:29.827 --> 52:30.994
No, the pie.

52:32.427 --> 52:34.534
You want a whole pie?

52:34.535 --> 52:36.444
Was that weird?

52:36.445 --> 52:38.718
You can get it cheaper at the bakery.

52:38.719 --> 52:39.862
We sell it by the slice here,

52:39.863 --> 52:41.266
it's more expensive that way.

52:41.267 --> 52:42.255
Not so.

52:42.256 --> 52:43.734
It's homemade right?

52:43.735 --> 52:44.958
Made it myself.

52:44.959 --> 52:47.194
Well there ya go.

52:47.195 --> 52:49.695
I'm having company for dinner.

52:51.979 --> 52:55.122
There's a piece missing, is that okay?

52:55.123 --> 52:56.710
No problem.

52:56.711 --> 52:58.790
It don't look good, a
host pulling out a pie

52:58.791 --> 53:00.558
with a piece missing.

53:00.559 --> 53:03.392
Trust me, these guys won't mind.

53:05.003 --> 53:06.920
Hey, would you like to,

53:09.360 --> 53:11.256
forget it, you're working.

53:11.257 --> 53:12.636
What?

53:12.637 --> 53:14.779
Just a crazy idea.

53:14.780 --> 53:15.613
What?

53:15.614 --> 53:18.224
Wondering maybe you might wanna join us.

53:18.225 --> 53:19.730
But of course you're working.

53:19.731 --> 53:21.646
Nah, she's off tonight.

53:21.647 --> 53:22.714
Come on, you never take a night off.

53:22.715 --> 53:23.571
Get out of here.

53:23.572 --> 53:25.338
Peg and I got it handled.

53:25.339 --> 53:26.339
Right Peg?

53:30.331 --> 53:31.979
Alright then.

53:31.980 --> 53:33.984
See ya tonight?

53:33.985 --> 53:35.402
See ya tonight.

53:44.981 --> 53:45.981
Really?

54:13.765 --> 54:16.911
So much for being fashionably late.

54:16.912 --> 54:19.615
Never wanted to be the
first at a dinner party.

54:19.616 --> 54:21.041
I don't think this is the type

54:21.042 --> 54:23.625
of dinner party you're used to.

54:24.986 --> 54:27.298
Can I offer you something to drink?

54:27.299 --> 54:29.132
What are my choices?

54:33.695 --> 54:35.645
Sparkling cider.

54:35.646 --> 54:36.646
Okay.

54:47.059 --> 54:48.475
Something smells delicious.

54:48.476 --> 54:50.153
Enchiladas.

54:50.154 --> 54:51.776
I didn't see 'em on your menu, so.

54:51.777 --> 54:52.649
On my menu?

54:52.650 --> 54:53.483
I don't wanna make you something

54:53.484 --> 54:55.052
that you make every day.

54:55.053 --> 54:56.470
Better then I do.

54:58.890 --> 54:59.890
Thank you.

55:06.178 --> 55:07.167
Cheers.

55:07.168 --> 55:08.158
Cheers.

55:11.239 --> 55:14.760
So what kind of dinner party is this?

55:16.348 --> 55:19.265
I think you're about to find out.

55:24.381 --> 55:26.612
Who's car is that?

55:26.613 --> 55:27.613
It's hers.

55:28.645 --> 55:30.023
She's a friend of mine.

55:30.024 --> 55:30.857
Hi.

55:30.858 --> 55:32.559
You saw her this afternoon, remember?

55:32.560 --> 55:34.477
Em, Emma this is Tevin.

55:38.021 --> 55:39.955
She's just a friend, that's it?

55:39.956 --> 55:42.063
Ain't nothing else?

55:42.064 --> 55:44.597
Nothing else I can think of.

55:44.598 --> 55:46.639
Your parents aren't coming after all?

55:46.640 --> 55:48.003
Emma made pie.

55:48.004 --> 55:50.171
And I brought ice cream.

55:52.061 --> 55:53.881
Well I guess it's okay then.

55:53.882 --> 55:55.465
Wait just a second.

55:56.558 --> 55:59.725
Apparently, it's okay though.

56:04.632 --> 56:06.299
Well hi, I'm Emma.

56:07.140 --> 56:08.569
And who might you be?

56:08.570 --> 56:10.181
This is my sister Angel.

56:10.182 --> 56:11.311
Hi Angel.

56:11.312 --> 56:13.121
What a perfect name for you.

56:13.122 --> 56:15.539
I hope you'll sit next to me.

56:16.956 --> 56:18.706
So, you know Gabriel?

56:21.088 --> 56:22.949
Not until now.

56:22.950 --> 56:24.768
Hey there Angel.

56:24.769 --> 56:27.355
Gabriel's the same name as the angel.

56:27.356 --> 56:28.731
That's right.

56:28.732 --> 56:30.163
But there's only room for one angel here

56:30.164 --> 56:31.553
and that's you.

56:31.554 --> 56:33.304
You can call me Gabe.

56:34.414 --> 56:35.973
This is the guy I told you about.

56:35.974 --> 56:36.938
He's my boss.

56:36.939 --> 56:38.677
Oh your boss.

56:38.678 --> 56:40.928
Yeah, I'm his, like his...

56:41.773 --> 56:44.840
Apprentice, bicycle tester.

56:44.841 --> 56:48.075
Wow, that sounds like a pretty big job.

56:48.076 --> 56:50.923
So your parents aren't coming?

56:50.924 --> 56:51.924
No, why?

56:53.148 --> 56:55.033
They work late a lot.

56:55.034 --> 56:57.175
So you live close to here?

56:57.176 --> 57:00.101
Why are you asking so many questions?

57:00.102 --> 57:02.219
They just moved near here.

57:02.220 --> 57:03.859
Right buddy?

57:03.860 --> 57:05.703
We didn't just move here.

57:05.704 --> 57:07.979
Yes we did remember?

57:07.980 --> 57:09.563
Who wants to eat?

57:19.827 --> 57:22.318
Can we say grace?

57:22.319 --> 57:25.902
Maggie's mom always
says it at their house.

57:45.643 --> 57:46.668
Thank you lord for these blessings

57:46.669 --> 57:48.564
we're about to receive.

57:48.565 --> 57:50.891
Thank you for the food on our plates.

58:21.480 --> 58:23.813
So who wants some pecan pie?

58:24.691 --> 58:26.069
With ice cream

58:26.070 --> 58:28.083
that you know who brought.

58:28.084 --> 58:29.084
I got it.

58:33.974 --> 58:36.831
Why aren't your kids here?

58:36.832 --> 58:39.729
Angel honey, I don't
have any children.

58:39.730 --> 58:41.565
How come?

58:41.566 --> 58:43.229
You don't like kids?

58:43.230 --> 58:44.397
I love kids.

58:45.699 --> 58:47.584
Then how come you don't have any?

58:47.585 --> 58:50.769
Well, sometimes things don't

58:50.770 --> 58:52.940
happen the way you want them to.

58:52.941 --> 58:53.915
How come?

58:53.916 --> 58:55.383
Angel, shut up.

58:55.384 --> 59:00.050
Hey, don't talk to your
sister that way, she's family.

59:00.051 --> 59:02.234
They're not married.

59:02.235 --> 59:03.235
Oh.

59:05.836 --> 59:08.019
You guys want hot
pie with cold ice cream

59:08.020 --> 59:10.020
or cold pie with hot ice cream?

59:10.021 --> 59:12.907
There's no such
thing as hot ice cream.

59:12.908 --> 59:14.049
Dang!

59:14.050 --> 59:15.800
I really wanted some.

59:21.229 --> 59:22.593
We gotta go.

59:22.594 --> 59:24.504
Well it's after dark
so I'll just drop you.

59:24.505 --> 59:25.465
No we can walk.

59:25.466 --> 59:26.961
That's okay, they don't go far.

59:26.962 --> 59:29.795
Hey Tevin I got something for you.

59:31.265 --> 59:34.786
I really did enjoy
getting to know you Angel.

59:34.787 --> 59:38.724
I wish I had
a mommy like you.

59:38.725 --> 59:40.142
Here ya go Tev.

59:41.235 --> 59:43.418
You bring it back when
you come back to work.

59:43.419 --> 59:45.914
Bring Angel if you want.

59:45.915 --> 59:47.033
We have coloring books.

59:47.034 --> 59:48.034
Really?

59:51.284 --> 59:52.284
Okay, bye.

59:54.391 --> 59:55.468
Bye.

59:55.469 --> 59:56.549
Bye.

59:56.550 --> 59:57.756
Goodnight.

59:57.757 --> 59:59.424
Goodnight.

01:00:10.276 --> 01:00:13.241
We used to dance to this song.

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.242
I know.

01:00:15.232 --> 01:00:17.724
We only danced that one time.

01:00:17.725 --> 01:00:20.725

01:00:23.172 --> 01:00:25.095
I wish we danced a longer song.

01:00:25.096 --> 01:00:29.334
<i>♪ I cannot get o'er ♪</i>

01:00:29.335 --> 01:00:34.335

<i>♪ I wings to fly ♪</i>

01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:39.676
What was that?

01:00:40.876 --> 01:00:45.876
<i>♪ Give me a boat ♪</i>

01:00:46.245 --> 01:00:49.520

01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:52.016

<i>♪ And both shall cross ♪</i>

01:00:59.844 --> 01:01:02.702
They ran away from home.

01:01:02.703 --> 01:01:05.474
Well, where are their parents?

01:01:05.475 --> 01:01:07.450
Their mom died.

01:01:07.451 --> 01:01:10.778
I don't think their
father's in the picture.

01:01:10.779 --> 01:01:13.558
How long ago
did this happen?

01:01:13.559 --> 01:01:15.052
A couple days ago I think.

01:01:15.053 --> 01:01:16.196
They don't act like kids whose

01:01:16.197 --> 01:01:17.614
mother just died.

01:01:20.475 --> 01:01:22.384
I'm not sure they know.

01:01:22.385 --> 01:01:23.854
And how do you know?

01:01:23.855 --> 01:01:25.605
Kinda a long story.

01:01:27.455 --> 01:01:29.300
Why are they here?

01:01:29.301 --> 01:01:32.060
I mean, they can't just
live in a tree house.

01:01:32.061 --> 01:01:33.620
I'm sure people are looking for them.

01:01:33.621 --> 01:01:36.518
They can't just be outside.

01:01:36.519 --> 01:01:38.404
Yes they can.

01:01:38.405 --> 01:01:40.186
Until I figure out what to do.

01:01:40.187 --> 01:01:42.644
Come on Gabe, you know what to do.

01:01:42.645 --> 01:01:45.191
What happens after that?

01:01:45.192 --> 01:01:47.230
They won't be sleeping in a tree house.

01:01:47.231 --> 01:01:49.182
And probably not together anyway.

01:01:49.183 --> 01:01:51.312
What does that mean?

01:01:51.313 --> 01:01:52.213
What makes you think that they'll

01:01:52.214 --> 01:01:53.900
be placed together in a home?

01:01:53.901 --> 01:01:55.772
Of course they will,
they're brother and sister.

01:01:55.773 --> 01:01:56.825
So?

01:01:56.826 --> 01:01:58.722
So they'll keep them together.

01:01:58.723 --> 01:02:00.334
Or will try to.

01:02:00.335 --> 01:02:02.976
They don't just tear families
apart if they can help it.

01:02:02.977 --> 01:02:03.977
Right.

01:02:05.918 --> 01:02:07.864
And you know this how?

01:02:07.865 --> 01:02:10.006
They're five years apart.

01:02:10.007 --> 01:02:13.012
One boy, one girl, different fathers,

01:02:13.013 --> 01:02:15.102
dysfunctional upbringing.

01:02:15.103 --> 01:02:16.686
No other relatives.

01:02:19.025 --> 01:02:20.978
Are you kidding me?

01:02:20.979 --> 01:02:23.047
The chances of them staying together,

01:02:23.048 --> 01:02:25.374
even money at best.

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:29.145
You don't have much faith in the system.

01:02:29.146 --> 01:02:33.185
Do you know what happened
after I left Ponchatoula?

01:02:33.186 --> 01:02:35.188
After your parents died?

01:02:35.189 --> 01:02:37.684
The night of the
district tournament finals,

01:02:37.685 --> 01:02:39.529
my father was getting primed for the game.

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:42.624
Something happened, he hit my mother.

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:44.879
For what?

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.683
He never needed a reason.

01:02:47.684 --> 01:02:49.669
But I decided right then,

01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:51.008
that was never gonna happen again

01:02:51.009 --> 01:02:52.509
and I told him so.

01:02:54.026 --> 01:02:55.896
He knew I meant it too.

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:57.480
So what happened?

01:02:58.783 --> 01:03:00.533
I went to the game.

01:03:02.826 --> 01:03:06.159
What I remember is my dad in the stands,

01:03:07.051 --> 01:03:09.801
my poor mom and brother with him.

01:03:10.681 --> 01:03:11.886
Was he still drunk?

01:03:11.887 --> 01:03:14.850
Ah, the tournament was much worse.

01:03:14.851 --> 01:03:15.981
Cheering for the other team,

01:03:15.982 --> 01:03:17.815
shouting awful things.

01:03:18.893 --> 01:03:21.481
He was such a jerk, security
tossed him at half-time.

01:03:21.482 --> 01:03:23.274
I don't remember that.

01:03:23.275 --> 01:03:25.136
Why would you?

01:03:25.137 --> 01:03:27.054
You never even met him.

01:03:28.007 --> 01:03:32.468
I really didn't think
you had the time to...

01:03:32.469 --> 01:03:34.714
I never would of brought you around there.

01:03:34.715 --> 01:03:36.382
Not with him around.

01:03:39.111 --> 01:03:43.194
My mom and brother, of
course they left with him.

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.555
They never made it home.

01:03:49.577 --> 01:03:51.577
Old man ran a red light.

01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:55.791
Mom and dad were killed just like that.

01:03:58.725 --> 01:04:00.988
And Jerry, my brother,

01:04:00.989 --> 01:04:04.799
his left side was pretty much crushed.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.966
He was in hospitals and
rehab for over a year.

01:04:07.967 --> 01:04:10.967
I was in foster care, moving around.

01:04:12.519 --> 01:04:16.536
Ended up in a place with
a bunch of teenagers.

01:04:16.537 --> 01:04:17.537
But Jerry,

01:04:18.277 --> 01:04:21.027
he's eight years younger than me.

01:04:24.285 --> 01:04:25.952
It just wasn't good.

01:04:30.265 --> 01:04:34.848
Do you realize what these
kids have to look forward to?

01:04:37.857 --> 01:04:40.484
What happened to you and your brother,

01:04:40.485 --> 01:04:44.498
it doesn't mean it's gonna
happen to these kids.

01:04:44.499 --> 01:04:46.166
Of course it does.

01:04:49.221 --> 01:04:52.753
Well one way or another,
they have to be inside.

01:04:52.754 --> 01:04:53.754
Have a home.

01:04:56.303 --> 01:04:58.421
I'll figure something out.

01:04:58.422 --> 01:04:59.970
We.

01:04:59.971 --> 01:05:02.778
We'll figure something out.

01:05:02.779 --> 01:05:05.779
Two heads are better than one right?

01:05:07.264 --> 01:05:09.418
Listen, my father wasn't the only

01:05:09.419 --> 01:05:11.419
alcoholic in the family.

01:05:14.764 --> 01:05:17.764
I kinda figured that was the case.

01:05:20.226 --> 01:05:22.809
I've seen a lot of hurt Emma.

01:05:24.553 --> 01:05:26.470
'Caused some of it too.

01:05:30.429 --> 01:05:32.782
Where's your brother now?

01:05:32.783 --> 01:05:33.866
California.

01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:37.057
Is he alright?

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:38.308
Last I heard.

01:05:39.983 --> 01:05:42.117
Til one day I get a call and he won't be.

01:05:42.118 --> 01:05:44.701
He tried to kill himself twice.

01:05:48.227 --> 01:05:49.227
How?

01:05:50.255 --> 01:05:52.588
If you don't mind me asking.

01:05:59.785 --> 01:06:00.785
Pills.

01:06:04.735 --> 01:06:05.818
I told him he

01:06:07.779 --> 01:06:09.373
how to use a gun.

01:06:09.374 --> 01:06:10.957
Why?

01:06:10.958 --> 01:06:13.919
Well if you're that sad,

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.670
hey, finish it right.

01:06:18.902 --> 01:06:21.569
Do you ever get that sad Gabe?

01:06:23.036 --> 01:06:24.703
I have my moments.

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:27.066
You have a gun?

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.190
Behind that coffee table.

01:06:51.869 --> 01:06:53.702
We gotta go.

01:06:56.094 --> 01:06:58.551
Are we going home?

01:06:58.552 --> 01:06:59.552
No.

01:07:00.397 --> 01:07:02.607
Then I wanna stay.

01:07:02.608 --> 01:07:04.715
Those people know we ran away.

01:07:04.716 --> 01:07:05.716
So?

01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:20.027
Good morning Tate.

01:07:20.028 --> 01:07:20.861
Good morning.

01:07:20.862 --> 01:07:21.712
Coffee?

01:07:21.713 --> 01:07:22.708
Yeah but you better make it to go,

01:07:22.709 --> 01:07:23.576
I'm in kind of a hurry.

01:07:23.577 --> 01:07:25.255
Alright, you want a fritter with that?

01:07:25.256 --> 01:07:26.089
No I better not.

01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:29.075
Dispatchers could not wait until tonight.

01:07:29.076 --> 01:07:31.409
It is a mystery to us all.

01:07:32.534 --> 01:07:37.201
Who was that women that you
were in here with yesterday?

01:07:38.644 --> 01:07:39.811
The hot one.

01:07:40.645 --> 01:07:42.361
Oh, Glynnis Harmon, social services.

01:07:42.362 --> 01:07:43.233
Why?

01:07:43.234 --> 01:07:46.263
No reason really, just curious.

01:07:46.264 --> 01:07:50.333
I thought I heard her mention Gabe Dunham.

01:07:50.334 --> 01:07:51.334
Really?

01:07:52.438 --> 01:07:53.737
Well since when have you been listening

01:07:53.738 --> 01:07:56.393
in on official police business young lady.

01:07:56.394 --> 01:07:58.913
Since it had anything
to do with any Dunham.

01:07:58.914 --> 01:08:01.430
Oh, now I'm starting to get the picture.

01:08:01.431 --> 01:08:02.764
Kinda hard not to listen in Tate

01:08:02.765 --> 01:08:06.470
seeing as how much official
business you do in my diner.

01:08:06.471 --> 01:08:07.819
Well I'm just a man of the people.

01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:08.820
Uh huh.

01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:11.014
That you are.

01:08:11.015 --> 01:08:14.666
Yeah, there's a fritter in there.

01:08:14.667 --> 01:08:16.496
Nothing gets by you.

01:08:16.497 --> 01:08:18.747
That's why I'm the Chief.

01:08:19.643 --> 01:08:21.124
I cannot waste food.

01:08:21.125 --> 01:08:22.519
Put it on my tab.

01:08:40.143 --> 01:08:41.196
Are you still
going to meetings?

01:08:41.197 --> 01:08:44.537
Yeah, I've been coming to see you doc.

01:08:44.538 --> 01:08:47.814
I don't think I can stomach
anymore of the psycho babble.

01:08:47.814 --> 01:08:49.282
Is that what you consider this?

01:08:49.283 --> 01:08:50.337
Psycho babble?

01:08:50.339 --> 01:08:52.258
Nothing personal.

01:08:52.259 --> 01:08:53.520
It's personal for you.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.966
It's boring for me.

01:08:54.966 --> 01:08:56.770
It's not boring for me.

01:08:56.772 --> 01:08:59.073
Yeah, that's 'cause you're getting paid.

01:08:59.075 --> 01:09:00.478
Do you resent that?

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:01.645
My being paid?

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:05.078
That's clever.

01:09:05.078 --> 01:09:06.301
The way you phrased that.

01:09:06.303 --> 01:09:07.818
How so?

01:09:07.819 --> 01:09:11.926
Being paid, like the money
just appears in your mailbox.

01:09:11.926 --> 01:09:14.580
Ah, so I am to presume

01:09:14.581 --> 01:09:17.127
that you resent paying me?

01:09:17.129 --> 01:09:19.638
I resent having to pay for this bull

01:09:19.639 --> 01:09:22.120
to speed along the probation process.

01:09:22.121 --> 01:09:24.497
So you don't see any
merit in these sessions?

01:09:24.499 --> 01:09:25.863
I think it's a waste of my time.

01:09:25.865 --> 01:09:27.837
Then don't make it a waste of mine!

01:09:27.839 --> 01:09:28.984
You want me to leave?

01:09:28.984 --> 01:09:29.818
Fine.

01:09:29.819 --> 01:09:31.844
No, I want you to stop being gutless.

01:09:31.845 --> 01:09:33.091
Watch yourself doc.

01:09:33.093 --> 01:09:34.067
No, I'm watching you.

01:09:34.068 --> 01:09:37.234
I'm watching you avoid every question.

01:09:38.203 --> 01:09:39.956
You know, run away from all of your issues

01:09:39.957 --> 01:09:42.504
because you're too
gutless to deal with it.

01:09:42.505 --> 01:09:44.872
What happened, happened.

01:09:44.872 --> 01:09:46.952
Talking about it won't make it better.

01:09:46.953 --> 01:09:48.134
No, but until you talk about it,

01:09:48.135 --> 01:09:50.578
until you deal with it,
you don't need a gun.

01:09:50.578 --> 01:09:52.540
You're already dead.

01:09:52.541 --> 01:09:54.958
Now it takes courage to live.

01:09:55.814 --> 01:09:57.040
Anybody can just go through the motions,

01:09:57.041 --> 01:09:59.612
anybody can breathe,
anybody can just eat a gun.

01:09:59.613 --> 01:10:02.030
But it takes courage to live.

01:10:04.775 --> 01:10:07.398
So what about it Gabe?

01:10:07.399 --> 01:10:09.316
You have what it takes?

01:10:18.659 --> 01:10:20.076
Last End Diner.

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:23.366
No she's out, who's this?

01:10:24.467 --> 01:10:27.550
No I don't, you wanna leave a number?

01:10:28.397 --> 01:10:29.666
What?

01:10:29.667 --> 01:10:31.369
I'm sorry, you're breaking up.

01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:34.370
Tell Emma the tree house is empty.

01:10:35.819 --> 01:10:37.402
No, the tree house!

01:10:38.819 --> 01:10:39.819
Forget it.

01:11:01.351 --> 01:11:04.962
Look man, I'm not here to
negotiate with you alright.

01:11:04.963 --> 01:11:06.758
You knew the price coming in.

01:11:06.759 --> 01:11:08.342
Don't mess with me.

01:11:12.843 --> 01:11:13.843
Hey Dill.

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:21.140
Awe son of a bitch.

01:11:22.033 --> 01:11:23.568
I can't help these kids

01:11:23.569 --> 01:11:25.306
if you won't tell me where they are.

01:11:25.307 --> 01:11:27.438
Not before I get some answers.

01:11:27.439 --> 01:11:28.881
Okay, you're not exactly in a position

01:11:28.882 --> 01:11:30.484
to be making demands.

01:11:30.485 --> 01:11:32.366
Neither are you.

01:11:32.367 --> 01:11:33.784
You're not a family member.

01:11:33.785 --> 01:11:38.256
And as I understand it,
neither is anybody else.

01:11:38.257 --> 01:11:41.050
Oh Roman, you got a second?

01:11:41.051 --> 01:11:42.936
Emma, this is Roman Sewell.

01:11:42.937 --> 01:11:44.756
Roman you remember Mazey Day?

01:11:44.757 --> 01:11:46.004
We spoke about her.

01:11:46.005 --> 01:11:47.772
Did you find the kids?

01:11:47.773 --> 01:11:50.074
Emma here knows where they are.

01:11:50.075 --> 01:11:52.073
Oh that's good news.

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:54.074
But she's not telling.

01:11:55.067 --> 01:11:56.234
And why not?

01:11:58.357 --> 01:12:01.202
That's a really good question.

01:12:06.334 --> 01:12:07.584
What's up JD?

01:12:09.611 --> 01:12:11.013
The tree house?

01:12:11.014 --> 01:12:12.014
It's empty?

01:12:14.633 --> 01:12:15.633
Okay.

01:12:30.971 --> 01:12:33.055
Hi, this is Gabe Dunham.

01:12:33.056 --> 01:12:35.092
I'm on Mapes Road

01:12:35.093 --> 01:12:36.510
just south of 22.

01:12:37.627 --> 01:12:39.294
I've just been shot.

01:12:41.295 --> 01:12:44.376
Too late, cops are coming,
they'll be here in a hurry.

01:12:44.377 --> 01:12:47.675
Who are you, the lone ranger?

01:12:47.676 --> 01:12:49.184
Why don't you have a seat?

01:12:49.185 --> 01:12:50.018
I know him.

01:12:50.019 --> 01:12:51.070
That's that bicycle geek.

01:12:51.071 --> 01:12:52.540
Yeah?

01:12:52.541 --> 01:12:55.074
Hey bicycle geek this ain't
none of your business.

01:12:58.842 --> 01:13:01.262
I know those kids.

01:13:01.263 --> 01:13:02.368
Yeah you think so, well so do I.

01:13:02.369 --> 01:13:03.876
I got business with this one.

01:13:03.877 --> 01:13:05.317
Come on!

01:13:05.318 --> 01:13:06.396
Where is it!

01:13:06.397 --> 01:13:07.897
Leave him alone!

01:13:09.257 --> 01:13:11.024
Ain't this cute?

01:13:11.025 --> 01:13:12.508
Leave him alone.

01:13:12.509 --> 01:13:13.342
You open your mouth one more time

01:13:13.343 --> 01:13:14.418
and I kick your teeth down your throat

01:13:14.419 --> 01:13:16.158
one at a time.

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:17.024
Where is it?

01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:17.873
Where is it!

01:13:17.874 --> 01:13:18.714
Where is it!

01:13:18.715 --> 01:13:19.556
Give it me!

01:13:19.557 --> 01:13:21.528
Where's my money, huh?

01:13:21.529 --> 01:13:22.529
Where is it?

01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:25.404
Where!

01:13:25.405 --> 01:13:26.405
I have it!

01:13:27.537 --> 01:13:28.369
Where?

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:29.286
I hid it.

01:13:29.287 --> 01:13:30.203
Yeah?

01:13:36.082 --> 01:13:37.499
You believe this?

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:41.498
I know I believe that.

01:13:44.059 --> 01:13:45.745
We'll be seeing you soon.

01:13:45.746 --> 01:13:48.256
Visit that secret hiding place of yours.

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:49.257
Let's roll.

01:13:53.769 --> 01:13:54.897
We're out of here.

01:13:54.898 --> 01:13:56.249
Nice gun shot wound.

01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:57.682
Thanks Vinny.

01:13:57.683 --> 01:13:58.840
I owe you one.

01:13:58.841 --> 01:13:59.674
You got that right.

01:13:59.675 --> 01:14:00.674
Yeah.

01:14:01.777 --> 01:14:03.766
Hey kid, I'm not gonna tell you again,

01:14:03.767 --> 01:14:04.767
don't move.

01:14:05.639 --> 01:14:07.056
Stay right there.

01:14:09.955 --> 01:14:14.398
Alright look, you don't wanna
press charges that's fine.

01:14:14.399 --> 01:14:17.220
Just means less paperwork for me.

01:14:17.221 --> 01:14:19.922
And what about these kids?

01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:22.122
They obviously can't go home.

01:14:22.123 --> 01:14:23.148
County's got people taking care of

01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:25.982
situations like this all the time.

01:14:28.675 --> 01:14:30.012
Yeah.

01:14:30.013 --> 01:14:31.013
Been there.

01:14:32.031 --> 01:14:34.574
Look, these kids have
been staying with me,

01:14:34.575 --> 01:14:35.408
why not...

01:14:35.409 --> 01:14:36.991
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:37.969 --> 01:14:40.256
They've been staying with you.

01:14:40.257 --> 01:14:42.270
Well yeah, sort of.

01:14:42.271 --> 01:14:43.117
They needed a place to stay.

01:14:43.118 --> 01:14:44.117
Sir.

01:14:48.107 --> 01:14:50.940
You can't just keep run away kids.

01:14:51.942 --> 01:14:54.154
What, I should of sent them home?

01:14:54.155 --> 01:14:56.405
What's left for them there?

01:14:59.213 --> 01:15:00.213
Hey kid.

01:15:01.369 --> 01:15:04.838
Were you home when the ambulance
came to get your mother?

01:15:04.839 --> 01:15:05.839
Yes.
No.

01:15:08.569 --> 01:15:11.652
She was real sick and she,

01:15:12.615 --> 01:15:14.448
she was just too sick.

01:15:17.073 --> 01:15:18.656
Mama died squirt.

01:15:21.285 --> 01:15:22.352
So now we need to find some other family

01:15:22.353 --> 01:15:25.094
members that can help
take care of you until...

01:15:25.095 --> 01:15:26.938
I'm her family.

01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:29.112
Man I can take care of them.

01:15:29.113 --> 01:15:31.446
Until you figure things out.

01:15:34.999 --> 01:15:36.830
I don't know.

01:15:36.831 --> 01:15:38.586
Look, I got a three bedroom house.

01:15:38.587 --> 01:15:39.914
Most of it's not even being used.

01:15:39.915 --> 01:15:40.968
And you can call Glynnis Harmon

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:42.306
and make sure everything's okay.

01:15:42.307 --> 01:15:44.890
She's already on her way.

01:15:44.891 --> 01:15:45.891
Great.

01:15:51.161 --> 01:15:52.186
Hilly.

01:15:52.187 --> 01:15:54.937
Yeah, hey do me a favor will you?

01:16:07.097 --> 01:16:08.684
What's going on?

01:16:08.685 --> 01:16:10.698
Are you alright?

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:12.125
Why wouldn't I be?

01:16:12.126 --> 01:16:13.364
Somebody said you got shot.

01:16:13.365 --> 01:16:14.702
No, no shot, no shot.

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:16.678
Just knocked around a little bit.

01:16:16.679 --> 01:16:17.679
I'm fine.

01:16:19.643 --> 01:16:20.643
Mama died.

01:16:24.115 --> 01:16:26.090
I know honey,

01:16:26.091 --> 01:16:27.591
and I am so sorry.

01:16:31.017 --> 01:16:34.150
Phil, why didn't you
bring the kids downtown?

01:16:34.151 --> 01:16:35.762
Sounds like you want them arrested.

01:16:35.763 --> 01:16:38.348
You wanted them, you got 'em.

01:16:38.349 --> 01:16:40.012
Why did you bring her here?

01:16:40.013 --> 01:16:42.952
Hey, I brought her
because she wanted to come.

01:16:42.953 --> 01:16:43.978
And you lied to me.

01:16:43.979 --> 01:16:44.953
Me, lie?

01:16:44.954 --> 01:16:45.954
Now there's the switch.

01:16:45.955 --> 01:16:47.098
No, no, no, you don't turn this around.

01:16:47.099 --> 01:16:48.828
Those kids were staying here.

01:16:48.829 --> 01:16:49.685
Not here.

01:16:49.686 --> 01:16:51.010
On your property.

01:16:51.011 --> 01:16:53.272
And you said you didn't see 'em.

01:16:53.273 --> 01:16:54.273
Sue me.

01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:57.044
You guys coming in,

01:16:57.045 --> 01:17:00.136
or do you wanna stay with Cruella de Vil?

01:17:00.137 --> 01:17:01.473
Gabriel they aren't your children.

01:17:01.474 --> 01:17:03.634
Well they're not yours either.

01:17:03.635 --> 01:17:05.038
Oh, that's right, you're the only one

01:17:05.039 --> 01:17:07.706
that knows what's best for kids.

01:17:08.655 --> 01:17:10.328
Tevin, wait.

01:17:10.329 --> 01:17:11.916
Hey.

01:17:11.917 --> 01:17:14.308
Hey, look I'm Glynnis.

01:17:14.309 --> 01:17:16.492
Do you remember me?

01:17:16.493 --> 01:17:17.920
I was friends with your mom.

01:17:17.921 --> 01:17:19.678
My mom's dead.

01:17:19.679 --> 01:17:21.572
No I know, and that's why I'm here.

01:17:21.573 --> 01:17:24.902
To make sure that there are
people that you can stay with.

01:17:24.903 --> 01:17:26.875
I can take care of us just fine.

01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:29.142
And Gabe can help.

01:17:29.143 --> 01:17:31.908
I know sweetie, but Gabe lives alone

01:17:31.909 --> 01:17:36.028
and he has a job and it
might be hard for him.

01:17:36.029 --> 01:17:37.279
She can help.

01:17:40.697 --> 01:17:43.620
Yes I can Angel, but Glynnis is right.

01:17:43.621 --> 01:17:46.121
And she knows a lot of things.

01:17:47.759 --> 01:17:50.509
Come on Angel, let's go inside.

01:18:10.401 --> 01:18:12.791
Where's your coloring books?

01:18:12.792 --> 01:18:14.770
Oh, yeah Angel, I'm sorry,

01:18:14.771 --> 01:18:17.771
I didn't make it to the store today.

01:18:21.753 --> 01:18:24.752
Angel, I keep that drawer closed.

01:18:24.753 --> 01:18:26.727
And not locked I see.

01:18:26.728 --> 01:18:27.888
I live alone.

01:18:27.889 --> 01:18:30.242
Yeah, my point exactly.

01:18:30.243 --> 01:18:32.187
You know what kids, it's time to go now.

01:18:32.188 --> 01:18:33.021
Let's go.

01:18:33.022 --> 01:18:35.258
We're not
going anywhere with you.

01:18:35.259 --> 01:18:38.675
Tevin, I am responsible for you.

01:18:38.676 --> 01:18:40.964
Do you know what that means?

01:18:40.965 --> 01:18:44.514
It means that it's my job
to see that you're safe.

01:18:44.515 --> 01:18:47.998
And that is a very important job.

01:18:47.999 --> 01:18:51.014
Yeah well I've got a job to do too.

01:18:51.015 --> 01:18:52.363
What's that job Tevin?

01:18:52.364 --> 01:18:53.902
I work for him.

01:18:53.903 --> 01:18:55.708
Okay, will you kids just wait

01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:57.164
here for one minute?

01:18:57.165 --> 01:19:00.582
Okay, I need to speak to Gabriel, please.

01:19:02.105 --> 01:19:03.375
They can't stay here Gabriel.

01:19:03.376 --> 01:19:04.562
That's a crock.

01:19:04.563 --> 01:19:07.058
No, you're putting them
with a bunch of strangers

01:19:07.059 --> 01:19:08.172
who don't even know them?

01:19:08.173 --> 01:19:09.056
That's a crock.

01:19:09.057 --> 01:19:10.618
Okay, how do you expect this to work?

01:19:10.619 --> 01:19:12.371
I mean you barely even know these kids.

01:19:12.372 --> 01:19:14.882
I know them enough.

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:16.739
How do you propose to take care of them?

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.158
I mean you don't have a car.

01:19:18.159 --> 01:19:19.822
Oh, or a job.

01:19:19.823 --> 01:19:21.878
I'm self-employed.

01:19:21.879 --> 01:19:24.010
Right, right, you're
a self-employed loner

01:19:24.011 --> 01:19:27.035
with a DUI on his background check.

01:19:27.036 --> 01:19:28.984
I mean what, you don't
think I've done my homework?

01:19:28.985 --> 01:19:30.208
Oh and you have a bottle of whiskey

01:19:30.209 --> 01:19:32.506
in the coffee table next to a pistol.

01:19:32.507 --> 01:19:35.118
Which has never been opened.

01:19:35.119 --> 01:19:38.268
Yeah, right, that makes all
the difference in the world.

01:19:38.269 --> 01:19:40.178
It does to me.

01:19:40.179 --> 01:19:42.096
What happens to them?

01:19:44.145 --> 01:19:45.964
It's an unusual situation.

01:19:45.965 --> 01:19:49.615
What happens to them today, right now,

01:19:49.616 --> 01:19:51.283
if they go with you?

01:19:52.489 --> 01:19:54.842
They're gonna be with somebody.

01:19:54.843 --> 01:19:56.752
Somebody they don't know.

01:19:56.753 --> 01:19:59.744
So how about they stay here,
just for this afternoon,

01:19:59.745 --> 01:20:01.745
until you figure it out?

01:20:03.437 --> 01:20:05.606
Okay, you don't have to go back to work?

01:20:05.607 --> 01:20:07.440
I'm the boss.

01:20:08.921 --> 01:20:10.099
I don't know.

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:11.016
I don't know.

01:20:11.017 --> 01:20:11.933
I mean, I,

01:20:12.977 --> 01:20:15.732
I don't know if I trust Gabriel.

01:20:15.733 --> 01:20:16.733
I do.

01:20:28.697 --> 01:20:29.919
Nice.

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.030
Angel you wanna try one?

01:20:32.031 --> 01:20:33.031
Here ya go.

01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:37.677
I wonder what's taking Tevin so long?

01:20:37.678 --> 01:20:38.849
I'm sure it's been while since he's

01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:41.605
got to use a real toilet.

01:20:41.606 --> 01:20:44.087
That's our bathroom over there.

01:20:44.088 --> 01:20:45.737
Not anymore it's not.

01:20:45.738 --> 01:20:47.321
Good, it's gross.

01:20:48.196 --> 01:20:50.065
Angel, you don't wanna live in this

01:20:50.066 --> 01:20:52.095
thing anymore do you?

01:20:52.096 --> 01:20:53.423
No.

01:20:53.424 --> 01:20:56.335
I want my bed and I wanna go home.

01:20:56.336 --> 01:20:58.971
I don't think you can go home honey.

01:20:58.972 --> 01:20:59.972
How come?

01:21:01.144 --> 01:21:02.419
With your mommy gone, it's not a good

01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:04.381
place for you right now.

01:21:04.382 --> 01:21:05.965
Can we stay here?

01:21:07.436 --> 01:21:08.763
You got lots of doors, I saw them on the

01:21:08.764 --> 01:21:11.269
way when I used his potty.

01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:14.455
I wish it was that simple kiddo.

01:21:14.456 --> 01:21:16.393
Why ain't it?

01:21:16.394 --> 01:21:18.644
I can pay you, I got money.

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:21.315
Yeah.

01:21:21.316 --> 01:21:23.804
How is it that you have money?

01:21:23.805 --> 01:21:26.920
Well you know, traveling money.

01:21:26.921 --> 01:21:29.743
Where'd you get money Tevin?

01:21:29.744 --> 01:21:32.111
Was it from that guy?

01:21:32.112 --> 01:21:34.305
What'd you call him, Dill?

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:35.306
What guy?

01:21:36.242 --> 01:21:39.325
Tevin does the money belong to him?

01:21:42.016 --> 01:21:43.417
How much?

01:21:43.418 --> 01:21:44.548
I don't know.

01:21:44.549 --> 01:21:46.953
A lot I guess, I never counted it.

01:21:46.954 --> 01:21:48.121
Where is it?

01:21:59.204 --> 01:22:01.204
Well that's a lot Tevin.

01:22:02.348 --> 01:22:04.598
How much of this is Dill's?

01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:06.860
All of it?

01:22:08.522 --> 01:22:11.019
I can see why he wants it back.

01:22:13.454 --> 01:22:14.704
Y'all stay put.

01:22:21.306 --> 01:22:22.973
Ain't y'all sweet.

01:22:24.256 --> 01:22:25.295
Where is it?

01:22:25.296 --> 01:22:26.683
Where's your buddy?

01:22:26.684 --> 01:22:28.987
Getting his nails
done, what's it to you?

01:22:28.988 --> 01:22:30.051
Or maybe he just ain't got the taste

01:22:30.052 --> 01:22:31.729
for what needs doing.

01:22:31.730 --> 01:22:33.980
I have what you came for.

01:22:41.452 --> 01:22:42.619
It's a joke?

01:22:43.676 --> 01:22:44.935
You a comedian?

01:22:44.936 --> 01:22:46.129
What?

01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:48.547
This was about 3,000 short.

01:22:49.684 --> 01:22:52.349
Pretty much makes you a dead man.

01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:53.725
Hey let's get y'all out here okay.

01:22:53.726 --> 01:22:56.285
There's no need for that.

01:22:56.286 --> 01:22:57.286
Come on.

01:22:58.236 --> 01:23:00.319
Let's go inside shall we?

01:23:05.841 --> 01:23:06.841
Alright.

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.743
Alright, what's it gonna be Mr. Comedian?

01:23:12.744 --> 01:23:14.431
You gonna give me my money

01:23:14.432 --> 01:23:15.759
or you gonna tell me another joke?

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.111
That's all I have.

01:23:17.112 --> 01:23:18.529
That's too bad.

01:23:20.253 --> 01:23:22.935
You know, my patience is
really wearing thin with you.

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:26.375
Leave him alone, please.

01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:28.953
Feisty huh?

01:23:28.954 --> 01:23:30.871
You wanna save her huh?

01:23:33.892 --> 01:23:34.892
No!

01:23:38.716 --> 01:23:39.716
Okay!

01:23:41.626 --> 01:23:42.626
Okay.

01:23:43.758 --> 01:23:44.758
I have it.

01:24:04.611 --> 01:24:05.611
Stop.

01:24:19.671 --> 01:24:20.671
Funny guy.

01:24:21.846 --> 01:24:23.513
Disappointed in you.

01:24:25.152 --> 01:24:26.420
Look at this.

01:24:26.421 --> 01:24:29.024
Well that's seen better days.

01:24:29.025 --> 01:24:32.625
You know, I'm actually more
of a revolver guy myself.

01:24:32.626 --> 01:24:35.524
Taught the kid how to load and unload one.

01:24:35.525 --> 01:24:36.358
Didn't I kid?

01:25:02.201 --> 01:25:04.590
Where's my money funny man?

01:25:04.591 --> 01:25:06.672
Or you die right now.

01:25:06.673 --> 01:25:08.423
I know where it is.

01:25:10.999 --> 01:25:13.003
Move funny man.

01:25:13.004 --> 01:25:16.223
This kid might just save your life.

01:25:16.224 --> 01:25:17.281
Come here kid.

01:25:17.282 --> 01:25:18.927
No, Tevin stay there!

01:25:18.928 --> 01:25:20.595
Oh, is that right?

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:26.821
How about his little sister here huh?

01:25:26.822 --> 01:25:27.691
Hey Angel come here.

01:25:27.692 --> 01:25:29.161
No!

01:25:29.162 --> 01:25:31.071
Oh she yours now?

01:25:31.072 --> 01:25:32.995
That's right.

01:25:32.996 --> 01:25:34.163
So is Tevin.

01:25:36.053 --> 01:25:38.691
Sure you can afford 'em?

01:25:38.692 --> 01:25:41.192
It's about to get real costly.

01:25:47.257 --> 01:25:49.167
Last chance funny man.

01:25:49.168 --> 01:25:51.611
I'm not letting you hurt these kids!

01:25:51.612 --> 01:25:52.612
Fine.

01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:56.689
Just for you then.

01:25:59.204 --> 01:26:00.204
Shit!

01:26:54.983 --> 01:26:58.316
When he was herding us into the house,

01:27:01.155 --> 01:27:02.155
I prayed

01:27:04.461 --> 01:27:06.628
that he wouldn't hurt you.

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:12.890
I can't remember the last time I prayed.

01:27:14.185 --> 01:27:17.186
When he pulled that trigger,

01:27:17.187 --> 01:27:18.639
thank God that gun wasn't loaded.

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.307
But it was loaded.

01:27:21.642 --> 01:27:23.596
What do you mean?

01:27:23.597 --> 01:27:25.697
I keep it loaded.

01:27:25.698 --> 01:27:26.698
Always.

01:27:50.194 --> 01:27:52.277
Maybe miracles do happen.

01:28:04.555 --> 01:28:06.843
I seen the Bible.

01:28:06.844 --> 01:28:09.641
Figured you'd get around
to opening it one day

01:28:09.642 --> 01:28:11.142
and you'd find it.

01:28:12.252 --> 01:28:13.252
Why?

01:28:13.930 --> 01:28:16.401
To pay for the bike we took.

01:28:16.402 --> 01:28:18.013
I didn't know how much it cost

01:28:18.014 --> 01:28:21.347
so, I just left you half of what we had.

01:28:23.847 --> 01:28:27.180
Snuck in this morning before you got up.

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:32.537
I didn't want you to be sad.

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:37.544
Thank you Tevin.

01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:39.944
But I don't know how sad I would

01:28:39.945 --> 01:28:41.861
of been about the bike.

01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:50.050
I didn't want you to be sad.

01:29:19.426 --> 01:29:22.093
So, you kids like it here huh?

01:29:23.141 --> 01:29:25.585
We wanna stay with Gabe.

01:29:25.586 --> 01:29:27.381
It's not that simple sweetie.

01:29:27.382 --> 01:29:28.460
Why not?

01:29:28.461 --> 01:29:30.785
Yeah, Gabe's our friend.

01:29:30.786 --> 01:29:32.449
The kids don't need a friend Gabriel,

01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:33.950
they need parents.

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:37.052
So what do you think?

01:29:37.053 --> 01:29:38.533
Hard to say.

01:29:38.534 --> 01:29:42.693
Courts aren't big on
unmarried adoptive parents.

01:29:42.694 --> 01:29:44.027
Well, what if?

01:29:47.737 --> 01:29:49.070
Yeah, what if?

01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:55.549
Like they'd ever let that happen.

01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:58.438
Even if they could get it approved.

01:29:58.439 --> 01:30:01.323
Look, all I want is
what's best for the kids.

01:30:01.324 --> 01:30:04.807
And did I mention I have
a lawyer in the family?

01:30:04.808 --> 01:30:06.417
I don't understand.

01:30:06.418 --> 01:30:10.294
Well I would like for you
all to meet Beth Sewell.

01:30:10.295 --> 01:30:12.621
I bet you didn't know I was a godmother.

01:30:12.622 --> 01:30:15.130
What's a godmother?

01:30:15.131 --> 01:30:17.821
A godmother is somebody
who loves you very much.

01:30:17.822 --> 01:30:19.069
That's right Angel.

01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:22.629
And Beth is going to be an attorney.

01:30:22.630 --> 01:30:25.865
And she's a court
appointed special advocate.

01:30:25.866 --> 01:30:28.637
Oh yeah, I've read about this program.

01:30:28.638 --> 01:30:33.629
They help keep kids from
getting lost in the system.

01:30:33.630 --> 01:30:35.930
Where were they 20 years ago?

01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:38.399
We didn't have then
what we have now Gabriel.

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.733
And I'm very sorry for that.

01:30:41.794 --> 01:30:42.794
What if?

01:30:47.787 --> 01:30:48.787
What if?

01:31:13.410 --> 01:31:17.488
You still have a lot of
hoops to jump through Gabriel.

01:31:17.489 --> 01:31:18.882
Well call me Gabe.

01:31:18.883 --> 01:31:20.383
All my friends do.

01:31:24.395 --> 01:31:25.395
Glynnis.

01:31:26.722 --> 01:31:27.939
Everything gonna be alright here?

01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:30.399
Yeah, it's gonna be fine here Tate.

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:32.753
It's gonna be just fine.

01:31:32.754 --> 01:31:34.053
Let's go.

01:31:34.054 --> 01:31:35.054
See ya.
