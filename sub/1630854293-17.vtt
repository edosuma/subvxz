WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:03.771
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...

00:03.871 --> 00:05.239
How long has it been going on?
Six months.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.174
I can see why she left you.
Here's hoping

00:06.274 --> 00:07.841
she found someone better.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.010
A bar fight?
I went out,
had too much to drink,

00:10.111 --> 00:12.012
I made a stupid choice.
You've been suspended

00:12.113 --> 00:13.781
<i>for two weeks.</i>

00:13.881 --> 00:15.183
I'm just saying,
this is a big city

00:15.283 --> 00:16.784
with a lot
of different neighborhoods.

00:16.884 --> 00:18.752
If something better
is out there...
Excuse me.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.554
Is this really
about the neighborhood?

00:20.654 --> 00:23.091
Or is it more about who she's
with, the company she keeps?

00:23.191 --> 00:25.826
Doesn't sound like you're trying
too hard to win me over.

00:25.926 --> 00:28.962
All due respect,
why do we have to?

00:35.503 --> 00:36.837
Hey, babe,
how's it coming along?

00:36.937 --> 00:38.372
Oh, I'm racing
to the finish line.

00:38.472 --> 00:39.773
I'm moving, trust me.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.575
Especially when our
baby's still in the womb

00:41.675 --> 00:43.477
and ain't gonna be crawling
for how long-- six months?

00:43.577 --> 00:45.513
Baby-proofing is recommended
before the due date.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.148
Once our daughter gets here,

00:47.248 --> 00:48.649
we won't have time
to brush our teeth,

00:48.749 --> 00:50.951
let alone baby-proof the house.
Well, then,

00:51.051 --> 00:53.854
I suggest we take full advantage
of those three weeks.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.089
Mmm.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.957
Mmm. Speaking of... Mm.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.526
You pick a name yet?

00:58.626 --> 01:01.695
I narrowed it down
to four a month ago.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.297
Ball's been in your court.
Okay, I admit

01:03.397 --> 01:05.399
I've been dragging my feet
a little bit, but Nichelle,

01:05.499 --> 01:06.800
I just don't know
if I see our daughter

01:06.900 --> 01:08.369
in any of those names,
no offense.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.238
But when people hear
our little girl's name,

01:10.338 --> 01:13.341
I want them to be intrigued,
and maybe a little intimidated.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.143
You know what I mean?

01:15.243 --> 01:16.777
Mm. Three weeks.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.012
Oh, shoot. I completely forgot.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.549
I'm meeting my mom
to pick out a rocking chair.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.551
This pregnancy brain
is too real.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.719
Mmm. I got to run.
All right.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.188
Missed one.

01:27.288 --> 01:30.023
I know, woman. I'm on it.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.866
My water just broke.

01:38.966 --> 01:41.835
Three weeks early is...
It's too soon.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.337
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.806
Okay, nope. No, we're all good.

01:45.906 --> 01:48.442
Just means we're on our
baby girl's time right now.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.144
I'll get the bags
that we pre-packed.

01:50.244 --> 01:53.447
They're in the...
Baby room, top left
shelf. I remember.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.749
I'm-I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go change.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.286
Yeah, go, go. Hurry up!
We got to get to the hospital.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.788
We're about to have a baby!

02:00.888 --> 02:02.790
Today's the day!

02:02.890 --> 02:05.092
<i>That breakfast burrito
sounds like carb heaven.</i>

02:05.193 --> 02:06.160
Let's do it.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.561
Got TapatÃ­o?

02:07.661 --> 02:09.330
Oh, you know we do.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.565
Thanks.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.401
So, first day back
from suspension.

02:13.501 --> 02:14.802
Yeah.
You doing all right?

02:14.902 --> 02:18.071
Yeah, of course.
Why wouldn't I be?
Come on.

02:18.172 --> 02:19.540
The whole thing with Bonnie,

02:19.640 --> 02:21.375
and then the department
coming down on you...

02:21.475 --> 02:22.776
That's a lot.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.278
Yeah, is that why
you invited me to breakfast?

02:24.378 --> 02:26.314
Think I need a little extra
hand-holding today?

02:26.414 --> 02:28.616
I'm just saying, no one would
blame you if it took some time

02:28.716 --> 02:30.218
to get your bearings again.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.753
Look, I admit all that sucked.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.755
But I did some talking
with Luca and Hondo

02:34.855 --> 02:36.657
over the last
couple weeks.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.193
Decided I need to let it go,
got to let it be the past.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.661
I'm all about
looking forward now.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.095
I got T.L.I. coming up
in a few weeks.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.997
So that's four days
in San Diego,

02:44.097 --> 02:47.034
honing up my leadership skills,
and if that goes well,

02:47.134 --> 02:50.238
I might think about taking
the sergeants' exam after that.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.905
So, a clean slate.
Mm-hmm.

02:52.005 --> 02:55.042
That easy. What about
the situation with Bonnie?

02:55.142 --> 02:57.945
She came by the other day to
pick up the last of her stuff.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.780
Didn't say much.
I said nothing.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.115
Are you trying
to submarine me here?

03:02.216 --> 03:05.753
No. And-and look,
I'm not knocking your optimism.

03:05.853 --> 03:09.790
It just feels
a little bit like denial, maybe?

03:17.231 --> 03:18.932
Are they okay?
Call for help!

03:21.635 --> 03:24.204
Gun! LAPD!

03:24.305 --> 03:27.375
Natalie.
Your name's
Natalie? Okay.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.877
Listen to me, Natalie.
I need you to take your hand

03:29.977 --> 03:31.211
off that gun,
you hear me?

03:31.312 --> 03:32.580
You need to help...

03:32.680 --> 03:33.881
We're trying
to help you, but first,

03:33.981 --> 03:35.416
you got to put the gun
on the floor.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.885
Look at me, Natalie.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.354
Natalie?

03:40.454 --> 03:41.955
You need to help her.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.925
Wait. What's your name?
Jane.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.160
My sister's name is Natalie.

03:47.261 --> 03:49.263
A man took us
and held us prisoner.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.699
I got away, but my sister...

03:51.799 --> 03:54.167
You need to help her.

03:59.307 --> 04:00.708
You call your folks yet?

04:00.808 --> 04:02.242
They're at LaGuardia now.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.612
They land tonight,
headed straight over here.

04:04.712 --> 04:07.214
Your folks are on the way,
should be here soon.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.919
Hondo, this is
really happening.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.654
Yes, it is.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.327
Medics just finished checking
out our driver, Jane Cruz.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.962
Luckily, she has no serious
injuries or concussion.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.097
Under the influence?
BAC was negative.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.567
And I was able to dig up
a Missing Persons Report.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.436
She and her sister
disappeared from their house

04:28.536 --> 04:31.839
in Whittier six months ago,
so that much checks out.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.775
Jane is 17, Natalie is 15.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.977
Jane could only give us
the abductor's first name-- Jax.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.212
We should get ahold
of the parents.
Mom's not around.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.014
They live with their dad.
Left him a message.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.716
All right,
then let's talk to Jane,

04:42.816 --> 04:44.217
see if we can get more intel
on this Jax character.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.854
Because, right now, he is
the key to finding Natalie.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.890
Hey.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.325
You're the cop
from the crash.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.627
They said nobody was hurt?
That's right.

04:53.727 --> 04:57.030
Jane, we need you
to answer some questions for us.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.999
And I need you
to find my sister.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.834
And that's exactly
what we aim to do,

05:00.934 --> 05:03.170
but right now, you're the
only person that can help us.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.406
We need to understand
what happened to you

05:05.506 --> 05:06.907
and Natalie
six months ago.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.743
You said the man who
abducted you is named Jax.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.278
How did you meet him?
Me and Natalie

05:11.379 --> 05:13.514
were at a liquor store
on Whittier Boulevard.

05:13.614 --> 05:17.585
I was trying to get us booze for
some house party. It was stupid.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.654
Jax was there,
offered to buy it for us.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.756
And Jax said
he left his wallet in his car.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.725
We went outside with him.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.727
Next thing I know,
we're waking up in his house

05:26.827 --> 05:28.462
with all of these other girls. Wait.

05:28.562 --> 05:31.231
Other girls? How many?
Seven.

05:31.331 --> 05:35.536
Okay, how-how did all that
get us to what happened today,

05:35.636 --> 05:37.270
with the... the gun, the crash?

05:37.371 --> 05:38.572
One of Jax's guys,

05:38.672 --> 05:41.041
this creeper with a ponytail,

05:41.141 --> 05:43.377
drove me to a motel
this morning for...

05:43.477 --> 05:45.813
well, you know.

05:47.180 --> 05:51.018
Anyway, I knew he kept a gun
in the glove box.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.754
When he wasn't looking,
I grabbed it

05:53.854 --> 05:55.956
and shot him.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.025
Then I stole his car.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.027
I almost didn't do it,
since Natalie wasn't with me,

06:00.127 --> 06:02.062
but I knew it was the only
chance I had to save her.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.196
So, please.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.999
You have to help her.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.069
Is this the man
you call Jax?

06:09.169 --> 06:12.440
He's older now, but... yeah.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.808
Commander, what's going on?

06:14.908 --> 06:16.343
Ballistics pulled prints
from the gun

06:16.444 --> 06:17.678
Ms. Cruz had in her car.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.480
Three pairs--
hers, the perp she shot

06:19.580 --> 06:21.014
and this guy.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.383
His real name's Eli Wyatt.
He's been a Most Wanted

06:23.484 --> 06:24.952
fugitive for the last ten years.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.321
Ten years ago, the FBI
was building a case

06:28.422 --> 06:29.957
against Wyatt for
the sex trafficking.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.391
One night, the Feds
showed up at his place

06:31.492 --> 06:33.961
in Ohio to serve a warrant.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.429
Wyatt unloaded on them
through the front door,

06:35.529 --> 06:37.130
instantly killing one agent,
and wounding another.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.966
Son of a bitch
went MIA after that.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.968
Not a trace,
not a lead, nothing.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.736
Wyatt's managed to stay
under the radar for ten years.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.337
He knows how to lay low.

06:44.438 --> 06:45.839
Jane said that whenever
they're taken to meet a john,

06:45.939 --> 06:47.407
the drive is never more
than 40 minutes,

06:47.508 --> 06:48.776
so the house they're in has
got to be close to L.A.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.377
She was able

06:50.478 --> 06:52.412
to tell us enough about
the local landmarks, we think

06:52.513 --> 06:53.881
it's in Tujunga.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.883
Triggered a handful of results.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.185
Got one property
in the Tujunga area.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.854
It's up off
Ponderosa Canyon Road.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.255
Dude who owns it
is Jax Evans.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.857
Could be our chance
to nail Wyatt for good

07:03.957 --> 07:05.493
and save those girls.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.427
Given the size and the terrain,
and the security--

07:07.528 --> 07:08.696
that, and Wyatt's guys--

07:08.796 --> 07:09.763
we're gonna need
to get eyes on that place.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.398
Stealth approach is best.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.701
Well, we all know Hondo's at the
hospital. Deacon, you run point.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.036
Let's get
to that house.

07:28.716 --> 07:31.619
Visual on one suspect,
male, armed,

07:31.719 --> 07:33.521
walking to the main house.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.689
No sign of Wyatt
or the girls.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.058
There. I got eyes on Wyatt.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.497
Hey.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.898
You two seeing this?

07:46.700 --> 07:47.968
Deac, we got company.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.303
Yeah. Looks like the Feds.

07:57.377 --> 08:00.080
Special Agent Alan Ritter.
This op is now

08:00.180 --> 08:01.615
under federal jurisdiction.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.016
So you just come
blasting in here,

08:03.116 --> 08:04.317
completely ruining
the element of surprise

08:04.417 --> 08:06.186
and sabotaging
our entire operation.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.755
This is no longer
a SWAT operation, Sergeant.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.322
You're no longer
calling the shots.

08:09.422 --> 08:12.926
If you want to stay,
you'll take orders from the FBI.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.795
What now?

08:14.895 --> 08:16.764
We're not leaving, are we?

08:19.833 --> 08:24.237
Hell no.
We're not going anywhere.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.376
Roger that.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.914
What'd Commander Hicks say?

09:07.014 --> 09:08.616
Take a wild guess.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.383
We're taking orders
from the Feds.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.185
They roll up here
and sandbag us,

09:12.285 --> 09:13.420
and now we got
to play by their rules?

09:13.520 --> 09:15.022
That hardly seems right.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.057
That's federal preemption,
Powell. They don't owe

09:17.157 --> 09:19.392
local law enforcement
anything, not even

09:19.492 --> 09:20.894
a shred of common courtesy, apparently.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.796
Do we have a deal, Sergeant?
Until those girls

09:22.896 --> 09:24.331
are located and safe,
SWAT is not leaving.

09:24.431 --> 09:25.666
I'll take that as a "yes."

09:25.766 --> 09:27.668
But your squad staying means

09:27.768 --> 09:30.070
your squad follows my lead
to a T. We clear?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.973
Yeah, I got it.
You're the boss, Ritter.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.609
So what's the plan, now that
quiet, careful and steady

09:35.709 --> 09:37.110
is off the table?

09:37.210 --> 09:38.979
Brute force is all
Eli Wyatt understands.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.814
We breach ASAP.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.883
Uh, Wyatt's not the only one
holed up in there.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.517
Our victim ID'd
eight other girls.

09:44.618 --> 09:45.786
Getting them out
and getting them safe--

09:45.886 --> 09:47.220
that-that should be
the priority.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.389
No, the priority is
apprehending Eli Wyatt.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.725
And the longer we wait to do
that, the more likely it is

09:51.825 --> 09:53.326
those girls in there
end up dead.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.363
You've got to be kidding me.
The FBI bigfooting in here

09:56.463 --> 09:58.031
has already put those girls
in more danger.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.133
Powell, that's enough.

10:01.468 --> 10:04.404
All right, we can agree
that Wyatt's inside.

10:04.504 --> 10:05.939
So there's no rush to breach.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.507
At least let my team

10:07.607 --> 10:10.043
sweep the perimeter,
see if we can locate the girls.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.048
Fine,

10:15.148 --> 10:17.084
but no one makes a move
without informing me.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.418
In the meantime,

10:18.518 --> 10:21.121
I'll engage Wyatt,
get him talking.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.357
What's
going on, Deac?

10:24.457 --> 10:26.426
Ritter seems like
a real piece of work. Well,

10:26.526 --> 10:28.796
be that as it may, he's agreed
to let us do a perimeter check.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.197
See if we can
find those girls.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.665
According to Jane,
they were usually kept

10:31.765 --> 10:33.133
in one of the back buildings.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.401
Yeah, but given our
less-than-subtle arrival,

10:34.501 --> 10:35.602
he could've moved them by now.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.370
This is so not how
we planned our op.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.206
Well, this is not
our op anymore.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.109
It's not ideal,
but the mission goes unchanged.

10:42.209 --> 10:45.913
We find those girls, and we get
them safe. Is that understood?

10:47.781 --> 10:49.149
Roger.
All right.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.218
Street, you and Tan with me
on the three side.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.385
Cabrera, you and Powell--

10:52.485 --> 10:55.022
you take the two. Let's go.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.560
So, you all decided to order
the early bird special today.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.162
Mm. Hey, Doc.

11:02.262 --> 11:05.432
Dr. Price, we did not expect
to see you this soon.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.234
No cause for concern.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.302
But I read that babies born
early have a higher risk

11:09.402 --> 11:12.305
of breathing problems, jaundice,
issues with brain development.

11:12.405 --> 11:16.043
And the percentages for any
of that are extremely small.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.577
You're well out
of the premature zone.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.546
You've had a healthy pregnancy.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.883
I intend to deliver
a healthy baby today.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.417
So we are having a baby today?

11:24.517 --> 11:26.453
Unless you both have
somewhere else you need to be.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.090
Hi, sweetheart!

11:30.190 --> 11:32.125
Hi, Mom. Hi.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.894
I'm going to give you
some family time.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.796
Contractions are
irregular right now,

11:35.896 --> 11:37.330
every ten to 15 minutes.

11:37.430 --> 11:41.134
Nothing exciting for labor
quite yet, but we'll get there.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.302
Okay.
Hmm.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.871
How are you doing, honey?

11:43.971 --> 11:46.106
I was so nervous that
the baby would already be here

11:46.206 --> 11:48.041
before we arrived.
Yeah, took us a while

11:48.141 --> 11:50.643
to find our way. You know,
we don't get to this part

11:50.744 --> 11:51.979
of town very often.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.214
Well, you're here now,

11:54.314 --> 11:56.649
and it sounds like
it's going to be a while.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.718
Oh, good. That means
there's plenty of time

11:58.819 --> 12:01.488
to get you transferred over
to UCLA. My college roommate

12:01.588 --> 12:03.256
is head of obstetrics there.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.625
Mr. Carmichael,
we didn't draw the short straw

12:05.725 --> 12:07.360
on this hospital.
We chose it.

12:07.460 --> 12:10.263
We did our research, and it has
among the best maternity care

12:10.363 --> 12:11.664
in L.A. for Black women.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.600
That sales pitch
don't work on me.

12:13.700 --> 12:14.968
The truth remains,

12:15.068 --> 12:17.037
the bigger the provider,
the better the care.

12:17.137 --> 12:21.108
And you can't do any better
than Henry, hmm?

12:22.142 --> 12:23.743
Sir?

12:23.844 --> 12:25.946
Fun fact--
my Aunt Vivienne

12:26.046 --> 12:29.316
was the first Black nurse
hired here, put in 33 years

12:29.416 --> 12:31.985
delivering babies. Most
consider her a trailblazer.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.421
So thank you, but no thank you.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.323
Me and Nichelle got this.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.432
All this land,
tucked back in here--

12:45.532 --> 12:46.900
it's the perfect
house of horrors.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.735
Wyatt's got to be
a real sicko.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.737
Worries me how the Feds
are coming in full force,

12:50.838 --> 12:53.640
particularly Ritter.
I've met a few Ritters
in my day.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.142
Ego-driven,
throwing their weight around.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.544
He seems especially eager
to collar Wyatt.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.246
Think Ritter's in hot water
with the suits back in D.C.?

12:59.346 --> 13:00.747
Could be.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.282
It's just... nailing Wyatt
seems personal to him.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.951
I don't know.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.219
You good there, Tan?

13:06.319 --> 13:08.288
Two weeks gone, he's
a cadet all over again.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.557
Should we get him
some training wheels?
Yeah, two weeks gone.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.025
Want to guess
what I didn't miss?

13:13.093 --> 13:15.362
30-David.
We've approached a shed

13:15.462 --> 13:17.197
at the back of the house.
We're gonna check it out.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.366
Roger. Found a bunkhouse
on the two side.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.869
Moving to clear it now.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.010
Oh, there's nothing here,
but look at all this stuff.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.012
This must be where Wyatt
was keeping the girls.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.014
It's just
what we were afraid of.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.349
He must have moved them
to the main house.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.019
You got no way out

13:39.119 --> 13:41.121
this time, Wyatt.
Make this easier on yourself.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.191
Show your face,
let's have a chat.

13:45.993 --> 13:48.528
Agent Ritter. You know,
you of all people should know

13:48.628 --> 13:50.797
I'm not much for talking.

13:50.898 --> 13:52.232
And you know how I deal

13:52.332 --> 13:53.934
with FBI agents showing up
at my front door.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.435
Not this time, Wyatt.
This is the end for you,

13:55.535 --> 13:56.937
one way or another.

13:58.105 --> 14:02.142
Yeah, you're feeling pretty sure
of yourself, aren't you?

14:02.242 --> 14:03.810
Well, look
what all that confidence did

14:03.911 --> 14:06.179
for that poor agent
ten years ago.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.982
It's really sad.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.728
I got fertilizer
and diesel fuel.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.263
Could just be
legit farming supplies.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.664
Or it could be
the perfect cocktail

14:24.764 --> 14:26.266
for an ammonium nitrate bomb.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.867
This is Ritter.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.202
We got a visual on Wyatt
in the main structure.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.171
We're moving on the one
to make entry.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.772
Negative, Ritter.
Hold your position!

14:32.872 --> 14:34.942
I'm done waiting.
We're moving in.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.443
Ritter, we found explosives.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.078
This whole place could be wired!

14:39.812 --> 14:42.115
Anderson, pull back!

14:50.023 --> 14:52.192
Fall back! Fall back!
Fall back!

14:54.827 --> 14:57.230
Street, Tan,
get that agent off the car.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.566
Powell, Cabrera, you maintain
cover on that house!

14:59.666 --> 15:00.700
Suppressive fire.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.102
Go, Street.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.670
30-David. Shots fired.

15:03.770 --> 15:04.972
Multiple agents down.

15:05.072 --> 15:08.075
I need several R/As
at my location.

15:08.608 --> 15:09.509
Multiple shooters!

15:09.609 --> 15:11.611
Deac, pulse is fading!

15:11.711 --> 15:13.680
There's nothing we
can do for him here.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.448
Go, go.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.686
Get back!
Cover!

15:21.221 --> 15:23.123
Hey, Ritter!
Look out, third floor!

15:23.223 --> 15:24.724
Tan, give me cover. Go, go!

15:30.697 --> 15:32.865
Get your ass down.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.602
I need to get Wyatt.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.037
No, you need
to stay down and stay here.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.006
This is my op.
I'm the one giving the orders.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.674
Not anymore.
There's been a change of plans.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.211
Game over, Ritter.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.080
30-David. To the four side.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.415
We need to make entry. Agents!

15:48.515 --> 15:49.549
Give us some cover.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.320
Go!

15:54.021 --> 15:55.922
Move, move!

16:05.999 --> 16:07.700
LAPD! Drop your weapon!

16:11.538 --> 16:13.040
25-David. One suspect down.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.907
Bathroom clear.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.250
Hey, I'm low on ammo.
Toss me a mag.

16:24.251 --> 16:25.818
Ah!

16:31.858 --> 16:33.526
Get on your stomach.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.863
Stop moving.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.866
You stay there.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.770
30-David.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.805
One suspect down,
one in custody.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.875
Powell.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.120
It's okay. It's okay.
We're police.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.488
Visual confirmation
on the victims.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.756
They're safe.
I'm only counting seven girls.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.725
Where's Natalie?
I don't know.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.727
House is clear.
No sign of Wyatt.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.329
And no sign
of Natalie, either.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.931
How can that be?
They were here.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.633
One of our SUVs is missing.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.203
He must've taken the girl
and vanished in the chaos.

17:16.303 --> 17:19.038
That means they could
be anywhere by now.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.180
Where's Natalie?

17:27.280 --> 17:28.981
Did you find her?

17:29.082 --> 17:30.517
No.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.452
Wyatt got away.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.587
He took Natalie with him,
but I promise you

17:34.687 --> 17:37.056
we're doing everything we can
to get her back.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.058
This is my fault.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.527
I shouldn't have run away.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.562
If I'd stayed,
we'd still be together. No.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.665
None of this is your fault,
do you hear me?

17:46.699 --> 17:48.835
What about all the other girls?

17:48.935 --> 17:50.403
They're safe.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.305
They're at the hospital,
getting checked out.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.543
And Jane, I finally heard
back from your father.

17:56.643 --> 17:59.679
He's up in Reno.
Let me guess.

17:59.779 --> 18:03.850
He's not in any hurry
to come back, is he?

18:03.950 --> 18:06.419
He said he'd come
as soon as he could,

18:06.519 --> 18:08.455
and to keep him informed.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.624
That's why I need Natalie.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.762
She's all I have.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.034
Judging by that
look, I take it

18:22.135 --> 18:24.237
we got nothing new
on Eli Wyatt?

18:24.337 --> 18:26.439
Well, he disabled the tracker
in the SUV he stole.

18:26.539 --> 18:27.874
We've got a BOLO out,
and all of LAPD's

18:27.974 --> 18:30.243
on high alert,
but still, no hits.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.245
Disguising himself as an agent
and Natalie as a wounded girl.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.980
You got to hand it to him.
I mean, it was pretty clever.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.049
Bureau's already working
damage control.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.751
Deputy Director called
to apologize.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.820
Day late and a dollar short
as far as I'm concerned.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.089
Commander, Wyatt's on the run.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.492
He's better off on his own.
Why take Natalie with him?

18:45.592 --> 18:47.026
Who knows?
Pretending

18:47.126 --> 18:48.961
he had a wounded victim helped
with the deception,

18:49.061 --> 18:50.597
or-- I don't know--
maybe he wanted

18:50.697 --> 18:52.299
to keep a hostage
for collateral.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.401
Reason doesn't matter. Fact is,

18:54.501 --> 18:56.736
he still has her.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.272
Commander, Sergeant.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.874
Agent Ritter, you got a lot
of nerve showing your face here.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.076
If you weren't in that sling,
I'd probably put you in one.

19:04.177 --> 19:06.012
I understand.

19:06.112 --> 19:10.217
I owe you both an apology,
and Deacon, I owe you thanks.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.118
You probably saved my life.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.221
What's the status
of your team?

19:14.321 --> 19:17.190
One agent's in the ICU,
touch and go right now.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.059
The others sustained injuries,
but they'll live.

19:20.159 --> 19:24.231
More than an apology and thanks,
I owe you an explanation.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.098
Ten years ago,

19:26.199 --> 19:29.402
the night Eli Wyatt shot
and killed one of our own,

19:29.502 --> 19:31.904
I was there.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.174
The agent
who died was my partner.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.744
I let my emotions

19:37.844 --> 19:40.880
get the best of me today,
and I take the blame for that.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.751
Well, had you given SWAT
a chance before this mess,

19:44.851 --> 19:46.953
you would've learned
that we're your allies.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.121
We're every bit as interested
in getting justice

19:49.222 --> 19:50.690
for your partner's death.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.726
With my team down, the Bureau
doesn't have the resources

19:53.826 --> 19:55.161
for a citywide manhunt.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.029
It's in SWAT's hands now.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.466
Only thing I ask--

19:59.566 --> 20:02.068
go get this bastard.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.310
Babe, last two contractions
were eight minutes apart.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.478
We're getting there.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.480
Oh.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.549
Is the SWAT watch necessary?

20:16.649 --> 20:19.252
Old habits. My bad.

20:19.352 --> 20:20.653
Can I get you anything?

20:20.753 --> 20:22.322
How about another popsicle?

20:22.422 --> 20:23.756
Oh, definitely.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.425
Okay.
But before you go,

20:25.525 --> 20:27.594
please shut off that crashing
wave music before I scream.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.229
Roger that.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.099
Hey, hey, babe.
Hey, hey, hey.

20:33.199 --> 20:35.468
Okay, I got you. I got you.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.803
Okay, maybe
that's enough walking.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.004
Let's get back to the bed.

20:38.104 --> 20:41.741
All right, you good?

20:41.841 --> 20:44.377
You should probably get

20:44.477 --> 20:45.712
two popsicles.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.680
You know,
in case you want one, too.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.351
Two popsicles coming right up.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.556
Oh.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.791
Mm.

21:02.395 --> 21:06.032
That was my old roommate,
Henry. He agreed

21:06.132 --> 21:07.567
to stop by,
take a look at Nichelle,

21:07.667 --> 21:09.001
make sure
she's got what she needs.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.737
Unbelievable.
Were we not speaking English

21:10.837 --> 21:12.472
when we said "No"?

21:12.572 --> 21:16.309
From an old parent to a new one,
I implore you, heed my words:

21:16.409 --> 21:20.380
sometimes what your children
think they need

21:20.480 --> 21:22.048
isn't what they need.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.050
Mr. Carmichael,
every decision we've made

21:24.150 --> 21:25.752
during Nichelle's pregnancy
has been

21:25.852 --> 21:27.253
in the best interest
of our daughter.

21:27.354 --> 21:29.756
Now, you may not like
every little decision,

21:29.856 --> 21:31.090
but you don't have to.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.792
You may be having a child
with Nichelle,

21:32.892 --> 21:34.627
but she is still my daughter.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.663
And she deserves far better

21:36.763 --> 21:38.465
than this hospital.

21:38.565 --> 21:41.401
Better than this hospital,
or better than me?

21:48.441 --> 21:50.343
Your doctor friend
isn't welcome here.

21:50.443 --> 21:53.380
And if he shows, I'll see to it
that he gets eighty-sixed.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.222
Yeah.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.360
Hey. Everything okay?
Sure.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.697
Just looks like I won't be
going to TLI after all.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.499
That was the program director.
I'm DQ'd.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.166
They just booted me.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.202
In light of my suspension,
they no longer see me

22:16.302 --> 22:19.439
as a viable candidate
for the leadership program.

22:19.539 --> 22:22.475
I'm sorry, Tan. I know
you were looking forward to it.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.079
It's Deacon. Got to go.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.815
We're gonna take a run
at one of the guys

22:28.915 --> 22:30.917
we took down at the compound.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.653
Yo. Just got a hit
on the BOLO.

22:33.753 --> 22:38.791
Glendale PD discovered the FBI
SUV abandoned in a parking lot,

22:38.891 --> 22:41.060
but no sign of Wyatt
or Jane's sister.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.263
You run a search for carjackings
or stolen vehicles in the area?

22:44.363 --> 22:47.033
None reported, but
there's a Metrolink station

22:47.133 --> 22:49.035
just a block
from where the SUV was found.

22:49.135 --> 22:50.803
Okay. You think maybe
Wyatt grabbed Natalie,

22:50.903 --> 22:52.171
hopped on a train?

22:52.271 --> 22:53.973
I mean, lots of routes,
lots of people.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.675
It's a perfect way
to hide in plain sight.

22:55.775 --> 22:58.010
Or get out of Dodge, which is
gonna make it that much harder

22:58.110 --> 22:59.412
to find him and the girl.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.113
Yeah. I'll grab Powell,
head down there

23:01.213 --> 23:03.282
see what intel we can pull.

23:04.984 --> 23:08.154
Hey, you good?
Yeah.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.022
Go.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.730
Wyatt must have promised
you a hell of a lot

23:17.830 --> 23:19.732
to get you to
traffic young girls.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.168
Whatever he promised you,
that's over.

23:22.268 --> 23:24.537
Look around.
He left you high and dry.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.739
So why are you protecting
that son of a bitch?

23:26.839 --> 23:28.741
I'm not.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.743
I have no idea where he went.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.445
Until you just told me,
I had no idea

23:32.545 --> 23:33.946
that he and Natalie
had even disappeared.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.616
Natalie's 15 years old, Cal.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.585
Jury's already
gonna hate you,

23:38.685 --> 23:39.886
seeing as you've
been selling her

23:39.986 --> 23:41.420
and all those other girls
out for sex.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.289
But you help us find her,

23:43.389 --> 23:45.792
at least you'll have some
little piece of goodwill

23:45.892 --> 23:47.627
working in your favor. Look,

23:47.727 --> 23:49.796
I swear to God,
I have no idea where they went.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.063
Did Wyatt have a routine?

23:51.163 --> 23:52.499
Apart from you
and the others,

23:52.599 --> 23:53.833
is there someplace he went,

23:53.933 --> 23:55.935
someone he brought around,
someone he talked to

23:56.035 --> 23:58.170
on a regular basis? Something?

23:58.270 --> 23:59.939
I-I don't know, man. A routine?

24:00.039 --> 24:01.708
I mean, the only thing
that he would do

24:01.808 --> 24:03.442
regularly was call his mother,

24:03.543 --> 24:05.011
like, every Sunday.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.980
How's it coming along in here?

24:08.080 --> 24:10.282
We're still waiting to hear
back from Powell and Street.

24:10.382 --> 24:11.618
Hey, get this.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.520
According to Cal Davidson,
Eli Wyatt

24:13.620 --> 24:15.287
called his mother every week.
That's not possible.

24:15.387 --> 24:17.123
His mother died
when he was still a teenager.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.058
I know. I read the file, too,
but if he's not talking

24:19.158 --> 24:20.593
to his mother,
who-who is he talking to?

24:20.693 --> 24:22.595
He have any other family?
Well, distant relatives

24:22.695 --> 24:24.797
he's never met, but the Bureau's
been monitoring all of them

24:24.897 --> 24:26.098
for the last ten years.
If Wyatt called,

24:26.198 --> 24:27.433
they'd have known about it.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.468
Wait. What about Wyatt's
alias-- Jax Evans?

24:29.569 --> 24:31.804
Everyone in Wyatt's current
life knows him as "Jax."

24:31.904 --> 24:33.405
And the compound we raided,

24:33.506 --> 24:35.474
the name on the title
is "Jax Evans."

24:35.575 --> 24:37.910
Requires a lot of work to create
a new identity to that degree.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.546
A lot easier
to just steal one. Yeah.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.481
Hey, check the name "Jax Evans,"
see what we get.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.522
Hold up. Look at this one.

24:50.523 --> 24:51.924
It's got to be.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.726
He's been in and out of prison,

24:53.826 --> 24:55.995
including a stint
up in Solano.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.030
Where his cellmate
was Eli Wyatt.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.032
Where's the real
Jax Evans now?

25:00.132 --> 25:02.034
Disappeared.
His mother, Eloise,

25:02.134 --> 25:03.836
reported him missing
ten years ago,

25:03.936 --> 25:05.805
right around the time Wyatt
made the Most Wanted list.

25:05.905 --> 25:09.576
Okay, all right, let's say that
Wyatt killed the real Jax Evans

25:09.676 --> 25:11.077
and assumed his identity.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.679
Why bother to chum up
to the guy's mother?

25:12.779 --> 25:14.013
What does that get him?

25:14.113 --> 25:16.048
The house in Tujunga, for one.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.650
The previous owner,
Eloise Evans,

25:17.750 --> 25:19.518
left it to Jax
before she moved

25:19.619 --> 25:21.788
to a senior home
in Palos Verdes.
Palos Verdes.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.289
That could mean
she's got money.

25:23.389 --> 25:25.257
Powell and Street pulled
the security footage

25:25.357 --> 25:26.458
from the Metrolink
station in Glendale.

25:26.559 --> 25:28.194
Wyatt and Natalie
were there.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.929
They hopped a train
headed to the South Bay.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.530
Well, they got to be headed
to Palos Verdes.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.232
All right, let's get over there.
I'll fill in Street and Powell

25:33.332 --> 25:35.568
and have 'em meet you. Go.

25:39.972 --> 25:43.309
Your last two contractions
clocked seven minutes apart.

25:43.409 --> 25:46.112
Hmm.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.547
Baby, this is
all so crazy.

25:48.648 --> 25:51.483
You and me here,
having our first child.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.988
You know,
when I was younger,

25:56.088 --> 25:58.725
it was all about the hustle.

25:59.726 --> 26:04.296
After high school,
straight to the Marines,

26:04.396 --> 26:07.667
and then right back home
to start my life with LAPD.

26:07.767 --> 26:10.670
I was always on time
for my career.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.672
I just never realized

26:12.772 --> 26:15.007
that I was late for my life.

26:17.409 --> 26:21.380
Thank you for seeing more
in this man than just a badge.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.116
Well, you are pretty fine, too.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.920
What-- Nichelle,
Nichelle, what's wrong?

26:28.020 --> 26:30.256
What's happening?
Talk to me. Talk to me.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.391
I don't know.
I feel really weird.

26:32.491 --> 26:35.061
Nurse?! Nurse,
we need help in here, please!

26:35.161 --> 26:36.863
All right, Dad,
we need you to step aside.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.397
Doc, what's wrong with her?

26:38.497 --> 26:39.966
We need to get Nichelle
to surgery

26:40.066 --> 26:41.734
immediately.
What?! Why?!

26:41.834 --> 26:43.970
Because your baby's life
depends on it.

26:50.509 --> 26:52.211
Nichelle, you have a uterine
rupture, which is cutting off

26:52.311 --> 26:53.713
oxygen to the baby and causing
the heart rate to slow.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.447
But you said
everything looked good.

26:55.547 --> 26:57.349
Doc, how did this happen?
The "how" isn't
important right now.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.285
We need to get Nichelle to the
OR for an emergency Cesarean.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.220
Is she going to be okay?
And the baby?
I promise you,

27:01.320 --> 27:03.756
Nichelle is in excellent hands
in my care.

27:03.856 --> 27:05.725
All right, let's
get her prepped.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.326
Nichelle, baby,
I'm right here with you.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.061
I'm right here.
I'm scared, Hondo.

27:09.161 --> 27:11.097
What if--
No, no, no, we're not
doing that. You know why?

27:11.197 --> 27:13.700
Because you and I are gonna
bring our daughter home

27:13.800 --> 27:15.401
to a baby-proofed nursery today.

27:15.501 --> 27:17.704
You didn't miss an outlet?

27:17.804 --> 27:19.371
Promise?
I would never lie to you.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.240
We have to go!

27:21.340 --> 27:23.075
You're gonna be okay.

27:23.175 --> 27:26.045
You're gonna be okay, baby.

27:34.553 --> 27:36.055
Any sign of Wyatt and Natalie?

27:36.155 --> 27:38.791
They were here, but they took
off before the local PD arrived.

27:38.891 --> 27:39.892
Wyatt entered through
a back entrance,

27:39.992 --> 27:41.427
trying to keep a low profile,

27:41.527 --> 27:43.295
but one of the staff
recognized him from the news.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.697
Situation quickly escalated,

27:44.797 --> 27:46.699
but luckily,
everyone's safe.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.600
What about Eloise Evans?

27:48.701 --> 27:50.669
Yeah, she's in her room.
EMT's wrapping up.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.571
Hi, Eloise.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.774
I'm Sergeant Kay,
this is Officer Cabrera.

27:54.874 --> 27:56.743
Do you mind if we ask you
a few questions?
Okay.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.745
Mr. Wyatt--
when he was here today,

27:58.845 --> 28:01.013
did he tell you
what he was looking for?

28:01.113 --> 28:03.415
I just knew him as Eli.
I didn't know his last name.

28:03.515 --> 28:06.118
I suppose that
makes me foolish, doesn't it?

28:06.218 --> 28:07.386
Not at all.

28:07.486 --> 28:09.188
Mr. Wyatt is a con artist
and a criminal.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.522
This is not your fault.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.825
Did he say what he wanted?
No.

28:12.925 --> 28:16.128
Normally, when he visits,
we just sit and talk,

28:16.228 --> 28:19.298
but he was...
he was different today.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.500
He was like another person.

28:22.501 --> 28:26.538
He told me to shut my mouth,
and he went to my closet

28:26.638 --> 28:28.941
and rummaged
through my things.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.043
I tried to stop him,
but he shoved me,

28:31.143 --> 28:33.279
and I hit my head
on my dresser.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.647
I thought
he was my friend.

28:38.684 --> 28:41.854
Deacon? Closet has
a hidden compartment.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.489
He had something
stashed in there,

28:43.589 --> 28:45.224
most likely a go bag.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.659
The young girl

28:47.760 --> 28:50.930
that was with him--
did she seem all right to you?

28:51.030 --> 28:53.665
Oh, so young.
You know, as soon as I saw her,

28:53.766 --> 28:55.467
I just knew
something wasn't right.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.736
How do you mean?
Was she hurt?
No.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.738
It was the way
she looked at him.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.073
Completely taken.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.275
Poor girl had stars
in her eyes.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.877
What do you mean?

29:04.977 --> 29:06.846
Well, she was obviously
in love with him.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.851
Jane, we need you to tell
us everything you know

29:11.951 --> 29:14.086
about Natalie's
relationship with Wyatt.

29:14.186 --> 29:16.388
Relationship?

29:16.488 --> 29:17.790
What relationship?

29:17.890 --> 29:19.691
Uh-uh.
You tell us.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.193
You're not protecting
your little sister

29:21.293 --> 29:22.494
by hiding the truth.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.695
We're all on the same team here.

29:23.796 --> 29:26.298
We all want to find her.
So, please,

29:26.398 --> 29:28.367
tell us what you know.

29:30.636 --> 29:33.205
Jax, or...

29:33.305 --> 29:36.375
Wyatt or whatever...

29:36.475 --> 29:38.744
he liked Natalie,

29:38.845 --> 29:40.746
like, immediately.

29:40.847 --> 29:42.714
I barely saw her
after that.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.316
A couple days ago,

29:44.416 --> 29:46.986
I told her I was gonna
figure out a way to escape.

29:48.754 --> 29:51.557
She told me
she didn't want to leave,

29:51.657 --> 29:54.793
that Jax loved her.

29:54.894 --> 29:58.530
I begged her, but she just
wouldn't listen to me.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.266
Why didn't you tell us
this before?

30:00.366 --> 30:01.901
Like, I thought

30:02.001 --> 30:06.805
if I told you the truth,
that she loves him...

30:06.906 --> 30:09.241
you wouldn't care
about saving her.

30:09.341 --> 30:13.712
She's not in real love
with him, Jane.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.747
She's been brainwashed.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.483
So you're still gonna
look for her?

30:17.583 --> 30:19.685
You listen to me. Finding
Natalie was a priority then.

30:19.785 --> 30:22.754
It is a priority now, okay?

30:30.062 --> 30:31.263
Those poor girls,

30:31.363 --> 30:32.932
they're a mess.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.800
And I'm guessing that was true
even before they were abducted.

30:34.901 --> 30:36.202
Yeah. Mom's long gone.

30:36.302 --> 30:37.736
From talking to the dad,
my guess is

30:37.836 --> 30:39.605
he was pretty much absent, too.

30:39.705 --> 30:42.074
All right, well, since
he's not coming, call DCFS,

30:42.174 --> 30:43.842
arrange for
an emergency placement.

30:43.943 --> 30:46.145
She's got nothing.

30:46.245 --> 30:47.980
Cool if I take her
by their house first,

30:48.080 --> 30:49.315
let her grab some
of her things?

30:49.415 --> 30:51.617
Yeah. Okay.
Just have Patrol take you,

30:51.717 --> 30:53.953
just to be safe.
You got it.

30:55.454 --> 30:56.722
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Paging Dr. Bender.

30:56.822 --> 30:57.924
Paging Dr. Bender, please.

31:00.592 --> 31:03.295
May I sit?

31:06.098 --> 31:08.167
You can sit
wherever you want.

31:08.267 --> 31:10.436
I got nothing
to say to you.

31:11.437 --> 31:12.738
Mind if I do, then?

31:12.838 --> 31:15.007
Say something, that is.

31:17.076 --> 31:18.945
I called my friend Henry
and told him not to come,

31:19.045 --> 31:20.512
because those were your wishes,

31:20.612 --> 31:26.118
and today is
about your wishes, not mine.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.788
Those are my wife's words.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.790
She's good at that.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.792
Tethering me back down
to the ground

31:33.892 --> 31:37.363
when I get above myself.

31:42.901 --> 31:47.806
We call Nichelle

31:47.906 --> 31:50.242
our miracle baby.

31:50.342 --> 31:54.280
Loretta and I had three
miscarriages before her.

31:54.380 --> 31:57.950
They were incidents that
probably could've been avoided

31:58.050 --> 32:00.219
had my wife received
proper care.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.955
Care that
women like her

32:03.055 --> 32:06.258
simply couldn't demand
back then.

32:06.358 --> 32:09.528
The day Nichelle
was born,

32:09.628 --> 32:13.565
I vowed to never put my baby
in a position

32:13.665 --> 32:16.502
where she didn't have
access to the best.

32:17.503 --> 32:21.507
But along the way,
I forgot to ask my baby

32:21.607 --> 32:24.743
what she thinks
is best for herself.

32:24.843 --> 32:28.580
She sees the best
in you, Hondo.

32:31.317 --> 32:34.086
And I'm beginning
to see it, too.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.456
Mr. Harrelson,
we're ready.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.841
Been looking all over for you.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.876
You've, uh...

32:57.976 --> 33:00.479
you've been
a little off all day.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.049
I was just messing
with you earlier

33:03.149 --> 33:05.051
with that crap
about being a cadet.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.453
Yeah, I know, it's fine.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.488
Guess I'm just, uh,

33:09.588 --> 33:12.924
not in as good a place
as I thought I was.

33:13.025 --> 33:15.794
Last two weeks,
I was just focused on today,

33:15.894 --> 33:17.896
this whole notion
of a fresh start.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.165
Yeah, I mean, it makes sense.

33:19.265 --> 33:20.399
Put the last few weeks
behind you.

33:20.499 --> 33:21.533
There's no putting
it behind me.

33:21.633 --> 33:22.734
None of this is over.

33:22.834 --> 33:26.072
You know, personal
or professional.

33:26.172 --> 33:29.108
Probably heard I got
bumped from TLI.

33:29.208 --> 33:31.043
Dude.

33:31.143 --> 33:34.213
You have been through
a hell of a lot lately.

33:34.313 --> 33:37.116
And I just hope you know
that we do not

33:37.216 --> 33:41.653
see you any differently
or respect you any less.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.322
You're still a part
of this team.

33:43.422 --> 33:45.391
I know. I just...

33:45.491 --> 33:47.693
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.461
Suddenly, not a lot makes sense.

33:49.561 --> 33:53.665
Look, I'm not gonna say that
I've been in your shoes exactly,

33:53.765 --> 33:56.135
but for me,

33:56.235 --> 33:57.803
when things were
a mess with Chris

33:57.903 --> 34:00.939
or when everything
was crazy with my mom,

34:01.039 --> 34:03.375
it was this job
that got me through.

34:03.475 --> 34:06.912
Working with all of you,
being out there saving lives--

34:07.012 --> 34:09.148
that is what made sense for me.

34:09.248 --> 34:13.018
I'm just not so sure
that's enough now.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.188
Tell me got
some traction on Wyatt.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.824
Nothing. Feel like
we're back to square one.

34:18.924 --> 34:20.426
Now this guy's got his go bag,
he's probably looking

34:20.526 --> 34:21.993
to skip town,
if he hasn't already.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.495
So then, he's out
of our reach, goes back

34:23.595 --> 34:25.364
to being a fugitive
on the Most Wanted list.

34:25.464 --> 34:28.200
Jane said that Natalie
is in love with Wyatt.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.102
It's classic Stockholm syndrome.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.503
Yeah.
This creep
has probably

34:31.603 --> 34:33.572
promised her the world,
and in return,

34:33.672 --> 34:34.940
she'd be willing to do
anything and everything.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.142
Hey.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.876
Anybody heard
from Cabrera?

34:37.976 --> 34:39.845
Yeah, I sent her
to Natalie's house

34:39.945 --> 34:41.547
with a patrol unit. Why?

34:41.647 --> 34:43.115
Well, the patrol unit that took
her there isn't responding.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.783
Now she's not picking up.

34:56.995 --> 34:58.397
Cavalry's on the way, Wyatt.
Knowing that,

34:58.497 --> 34:59.631
I'd choose my next steps wisely.

34:59.731 --> 35:00.732
Yeah, well, see,
that ain't inspiring

35:00.832 --> 35:02.301
much of any fear in me,

35:02.401 --> 35:04.503
seeing that I already
met the cavalry today.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.005
And look how
that turned out.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.507
Gun on the table.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.442
And then I want you to sit
your pretty little cop ass

35:10.542 --> 35:12.010
down on that couch.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.212
You stay put.

35:19.685 --> 35:21.520
I really don't like
repeating myself.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.455
I move, the girl moves with me.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.491
Yeah? Or I just
shoot you both.

35:25.591 --> 35:27.092
Huh? You're so
fond of each other,

35:27.193 --> 35:29.595
you can just die together.
Sit down!

35:30.396 --> 35:31.330
Natalie, I know

35:31.430 --> 35:32.798
you think he loves you.

35:32.898 --> 35:35.301
So ask him why he didn't
tell you who he really is.

35:35.401 --> 35:36.768
His name's not even Jax.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.470
Pay them no mind,
Natalie. We already talked

35:38.570 --> 35:40.272
about this, remember?
Why didn't you tell her, Eli?

35:40.372 --> 35:43.509
Isn't that what people do when
they're in love? Tell the truth?

35:43.609 --> 35:45.577
He didn't because
he doesn't love you.

35:45.677 --> 35:49.315
He's a liar,
just like Dad.

35:49.415 --> 35:50.416
Is that really your name?

35:50.516 --> 35:51.883
Eli?

35:53.185 --> 35:54.920
You sit the hell
back down!

36:02.728 --> 36:04.263
Girls, get down!

36:19.211 --> 36:21.046
Let's go.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.016
LAPD!

36:25.116 --> 36:26.218
Hallway.

36:26.318 --> 36:27.919
Roger.

36:33.058 --> 36:33.925
LAPD!

36:34.025 --> 36:36.161
Come out
with your hands up.

36:36.262 --> 36:37.396
Natalie?

36:37.496 --> 36:38.997
Come on out.

36:39.097 --> 36:40.532
Come on.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.368
Put the gun on the ground.

36:44.169 --> 36:45.504
Just put it down.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.573
Natalie, put--
We got a rabbit!

36:47.673 --> 36:49.475
25-David.
We got eyes on Natalie.

36:49.575 --> 36:50.709
She's armed with Cabrera's gun.

36:50.809 --> 36:53.245
Roger. Entering the basement.

37:00.852 --> 37:03.689
Natalie? Need you
to come out of there.

37:05.491 --> 37:07.526
Natalie just ran into a closet.

37:07.626 --> 37:09.027
I got an open basement window.

37:09.127 --> 37:11.897
Checks negative
for Wyatt so far.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.000
Cabrera?

37:16.201 --> 37:18.270
Drop your weapon, get on
your knees. It's over, Wyatt.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.472
All right, this is how it's
gonna play out, all right?

37:20.572 --> 37:22.140
You're gonna clear me a path,

37:22.240 --> 37:24.310
and then I'm leaving
with my new girlfriend.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.578
I'm afraid that's not
gonna happen.

37:26.678 --> 37:28.680
As long as Jane
and Natalie are safe.
No, not a chance, Cabrera.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.115
I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

37:30.215 --> 37:31.883
Then I guess you're gonna
watch her die.

37:35.954 --> 37:38.056
Hey. Here you go.

37:41.059 --> 37:42.828
You good?
Yeah.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.531
30-David.
Eli Wyatt's in custody.

37:45.631 --> 37:48.266
Natalie? We got him.

37:48.367 --> 37:52.070
So I need you to put down
the gun and come out, okay?

37:53.472 --> 37:54.873
I don't know.

37:54.973 --> 37:56.508
Jax won't like that.

37:56.608 --> 37:57.676
Whatever he told you,

37:57.776 --> 37:59.811
whatever he promised, he lied.

37:59.911 --> 38:02.147
But you know who kept
their promise? Jane.

38:02.247 --> 38:04.350
Jane's mad at me.
I messed things up.

38:04.450 --> 38:06.385
I messed so many things up.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.153
There's no going back now.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.523
That's not true, okay?

38:11.623 --> 38:13.124
I know things seem bad.

38:13.224 --> 38:14.526
But that's why you got
to trust the people around you,

38:14.626 --> 38:16.294
the people
who really care for you.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.664
Like Jane.
She loves you.

38:18.764 --> 38:21.467
I don't know.
Then trust me.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.302
I know what I'm
talking about.

38:24.403 --> 38:28.407
As bad as things seem,
you need to keep moving forward.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.376
And the first step is
you put that gun down

38:30.476 --> 38:32.210
and come on out.

38:46.358 --> 38:48.594
Are you okay?
Yeah.

38:52.431 --> 38:53.899
It's over, it's over.

38:58.504 --> 38:59.571
<i>Okay.</i>

38:59.671 --> 39:00.839
All right, good.

39:00.939 --> 39:02.941
All right,
thanks for the update.

39:03.041 --> 39:05.176
That was the commander
from East L.A.

39:05.276 --> 39:07.813
That patrol officer
you sent to accompany Cabrera,

39:07.913 --> 39:09.515
he's gonna be fine,
nothing too serious.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.717
Just a concussion from being
knocked out from Wyatt.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.952
Yeah, well, I'm just glad that
bastard's finally in custody.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.320
Well, you're not alone.

39:15.421 --> 39:16.955
Agent Ritter owes you
a gift bottle

39:17.055 --> 39:18.924
of something very expensive
as a thank you.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.526
Oh, you can bet I'll tell him
that when I call him

39:20.626 --> 39:22.461
with the good news.

39:22.561 --> 39:23.962
Yeah.
Just handed
Jane and Natalie

39:24.062 --> 39:26.197
off to the caseworker for DCFS.

39:26.297 --> 39:28.767
I made her promise
the girls would stay together.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.769
What about the father?

39:30.869 --> 39:32.771
He said he's happy
to hear they're okay,

39:32.871 --> 39:34.205
and with the good news,

39:34.305 --> 39:35.774
he doesn't see a need
to hurry back to L.A.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.676
Well, it's gonna be
a long time before those two

39:37.776 --> 39:39.144
are even close to being okay.

39:39.244 --> 39:41.246
I'm afraid that's probably true
for most of the girls

39:41.346 --> 39:42.814
Wyatt preyed on.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.315
You know, I-I'd like to think
that at least some of them

39:44.416 --> 39:46.317
are going home
to happy reunions tonight.

39:46.418 --> 39:47.553
Well, at least none of them
have to worry

39:47.653 --> 39:48.987
about Eli Wyatt anymore,

39:49.087 --> 39:51.890
so I-I'm gonna focus on that
and take the W.

39:55.694 --> 39:57.362
Don't.

39:57.463 --> 39:58.664
Don't what?

39:58.764 --> 40:01.467
I know what you're gonna say.

40:01.567 --> 40:04.069
You think that stuff I told
Natalie to get her to come out,

40:04.169 --> 40:06.472
you're thinking I had some
kind of big breakthrough.

40:06.572 --> 40:10.876
Well, you did sound
pretty convincing.

40:10.976 --> 40:12.578
I figured maybe
you believed what you said.

40:12.678 --> 40:15.013
It's not that simple.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.451
Let's just say
I'm not gonna give up.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.989
Good work today.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.824
But not one I want
to repeat any time soon.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.359
Yeah, I second that.

40:28.460 --> 40:31.229
Heard you had some inspirational
words to talk Natalie down.

40:31.329 --> 40:32.363
Don't.

40:32.464 --> 40:33.532
Yeah, don't.

40:33.632 --> 40:34.666
We already did that.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.201
Oh.

40:37.503 --> 40:41.406
Look, my life's
complicated right now.

40:41.507 --> 40:43.842
I'm not sure exactly
where it's headed.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.877
But one thing I know is,

40:45.977 --> 40:48.046
I'm lucky to be
a part of this team,

40:48.146 --> 40:50.281
to have you guys as friends.

40:50.381 --> 40:52.784
Much as it pains me
to say it,

40:52.884 --> 40:54.620
you were
both right today.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.088
Great.

40:57.188 --> 40:58.557
Then how about this?

40:58.657 --> 41:01.793
Since I paid for breakfast,
you pay for dinner.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.595
Yeah. That's the least
you owe us

41:03.695 --> 41:05.564
for fixing your life.

41:05.664 --> 41:06.898
Hey.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.534
Big news.
Hondo and Nichelle had the baby.

41:08.634 --> 41:11.603
We're all heading
to the hospital now.

41:13.739 --> 41:16.542
Hi, there.
Hey, baby girl.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.644
We did it, baby.

41:18.744 --> 41:21.112
Yeah. We did it.

41:21.212 --> 41:22.714
I love you.
I love you.

41:22.814 --> 41:23.815
So much.

41:28.419 --> 41:29.387
Can we come in?

41:29.487 --> 41:31.289
Hi.

41:32.858 --> 41:34.993
Ooh.

41:37.195 --> 41:39.297
Meet
your granddaughter...

41:39.397 --> 41:44.335
Vivienne Carmichael Harrelson.
