00:01.034 --> 00:03.901
My father worked as a lawyer
for the richest family in New York,

00:03.969 --> 00:06.336
until his plane went down in
long island sound.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.670
He left me his biggest client,
the Darlings.

00:08.741 --> 00:10.072
Tripp, the empire builder.

00:10.143 --> 00:12.111
Letitia, the sophisticated socialite.

00:12.212 --> 00:15.648
But don't you think it kills me to see
you making the same mistakes I did?

00:15.715 --> 00:18.445
- What mistakes?
- Putting three people in your marriage.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.610
Brian, the man of God.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.051
Is "orphan" not pc anymore?

00:21.121 --> 00:23.612
- He's not an orphan.
- Your brother, Brian, is his father.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.317
Patrick, the principled politician.

00:25.391 --> 00:28.554
I am tired of it all. The money,
the advice, the support. All of it.

00:28.628 --> 00:29.856
- Patrick...
- We are done.

00:29.929 --> 00:31.089
Finally, we get together.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.755
- It's been a long time coming.
- I'll say.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.424
Karen, the professional divorcée.

00:34.501 --> 00:37.061
Nick is my past.
You're my future, okay?

00:37.137 --> 00:38.900
Letting me risk
ruining my marriage to Freddy

00:38.972 --> 00:40.906
sure makes it seem like
you want me free for you.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.135
And Jeremy and Juliet,
the well-behaved twins.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.972
She's my best friend
in the whole world,

00:45.044 --> 00:46.011
and I hate her guts.

00:59.959 --> 01:03.520
Has anybody here seen that girl

01:04.129 --> 01:07.588
she's kind of pretty
and she's kind of plain

01:08.101 --> 01:11.434
she don't get out much into the world

01:11.671 --> 01:13.571
now, baby, are you sure
it's not bad luck

01:13.640 --> 01:15.073
- to see each other on the big day?
- Mmm-mmm.

01:15.141 --> 01:19.908
Who cares? That tradition has not
exactly worked for me in the past.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.614
What's that tradition all about,
anyway, huh?

01:24.717 --> 01:27.277
Did Moses cook that up?

01:27.387 --> 01:30.117
It's about seeing your beloved again
for the first time.

01:30.190 --> 01:33.626
And no, Moses did not cook that up.

01:33.693 --> 01:36.594
Have you two given any thought
to your vows at all?

01:36.663 --> 01:38.631
Well, I'm thinking a golf theme
would be nice.

01:38.698 --> 01:42.566
You know, something with hazards
and fairways and holes-in-one?

01:42.635 --> 01:45.399
No, all we need is "have and hold"
and "sickness and health. "

01:45.471 --> 01:46.768
And a little open bar.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.771
Now, Karen, as your brother, I agree,
no one cares what you say.

01:50.843 --> 01:55.007
But as your minister, I am required
to honor this eternal union.

01:56.382 --> 01:57.940
Okay.

01:58.017 --> 02:01.953
Just do what you want.
Just keep it short.

02:02.021 --> 02:03.921
See you in seven hours.

02:03.990 --> 02:08.757
Amen to that!
Because we are in it to win it!

02:08.860 --> 02:11.386
Next question.
- Mr. Attorney General, earlier today

02:11.464 --> 02:14.558
your office indicted one of the city's
biggest real estate developers,

02:14.634 --> 02:18.161
the Fantini brothers,
on multiple counts of bid-rigging,

02:18.238 --> 02:19.762
fraud, collusion, tax evasion...

02:19.839 --> 02:23.138
Fred, this lawsuit's a message to all
of New York's real estate developers.

02:23.209 --> 02:24.335
You will be held accountable

02:24.410 --> 02:27.538
for your corrupt and
deceptive business practices. Next.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.514
But aren't you worried
that by bringing charges

02:29.582 --> 02:31.516
against a Michael and sal Fantini,

02:31.584 --> 02:33.245
you may come into conflict
with your father?

02:33.319 --> 02:38.086
This is not about my family, Dave.
This is about our New York. Okay?

02:38.191 --> 02:39.453
Thank you. No more questions.

02:41.527 --> 02:44.587
The ambassador decided
to bring a date at the last minute.

02:46.399 --> 02:49.766
People can be so thoughtless.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.700
I'm kind of having second thoughts.

02:53.773 --> 02:54.899
- About the wedding.
- Yeah.

02:54.974 --> 02:58.410
I assumed that's what you meant.

02:59.178 --> 03:01.442
Is this about Nick? Is it?

03:01.514 --> 03:04.483
Nick? No. No.

03:04.550 --> 03:08.179
No, Nick hasn't even entered
my mind today. It's about Freddy.

03:08.321 --> 03:09.345
Ah.

03:09.422 --> 03:13.586
He's not exactly... complicated.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.821
You're just like your father.
You want fairytale love.

03:16.896 --> 03:21.663
You're a romantic,
but what's really romantic

03:21.768 --> 03:24.703
is to wake up every morning and say,

03:25.605 --> 03:30.338
"I choose you. Again. Today.

03:32.011 --> 03:33.569
"No matter what. "

03:33.646 --> 03:34.613
Mmm.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.812
Like you chose dad? Or Dutch?

03:39.585 --> 03:45.251
Well, I chose both,
and that was my mistake.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.589
But this just isn't you, paddy.

03:47.660 --> 03:51.619
This vendetta against my friends.
My colleagues!

03:51.731 --> 03:54.097
Where in heaven's name
did the notion come from?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.964
If this is some kind of a response
to my offer...

03:57.070 --> 03:59.504
Dad, I am the Attorney General
of the state of New York.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.938
I go after the bad guys. It's what I do.

04:02.141 --> 04:06.635
It's incomprehensible to me that
you could attack me like this,

04:06.746 --> 04:08.646
and on your sister's wedding day!

04:09.115 --> 04:12.084
You have become
a complete stranger to me, Patrick.

04:12.185 --> 04:15.814
The fact that you see this as an attack
in the first place is the real problem.

04:15.888 --> 04:21.382
Son, I think it would be
in the best interests of everybody

04:21.461 --> 04:26.160
if you were to move out of the imperial
for the time being.

04:26.232 --> 04:29.497
Maybe you should go upstairs
and take a look, dad.

04:29.569 --> 04:31.503
I already have.

04:31.571 --> 04:34.233
Well, paddy, I... oh, pat...

04:36.542 --> 04:40.103
You're doing the right thing.
For you and for your city.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.141
I know.

04:46.986 --> 04:48.078
Come.

04:51.157 --> 04:53.887
You look like you could use a drink.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.985
It's 9:30 in the morning.

05:00.066 --> 05:02.557
Is this about Patrick's
press conference?

05:02.635 --> 05:06.401
No. On the contrary.

05:07.039 --> 05:11.066
Today, everything is about my Karen.

05:12.078 --> 05:16.811
This is a little tradition, a ritual

05:16.883 --> 05:20.319
I enact for her weddings.

05:20.386 --> 05:24.618
I got it from her first father-in-law,
vincente de LA huerta.

05:25.625 --> 05:29.561
You open the bottle of Tequila
first thing in the morning,

05:29.629 --> 05:33.087
and by the time you go to bed,
it's got to be bone dry.

05:39.071 --> 05:40.436
All right.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.278
It's amazing.

05:52.251 --> 05:54.913
Certainly has its virtues, doesn't it?

05:59.692 --> 06:01.250
Uh, Tripp...

06:03.563 --> 06:05.690
You know, those silly magazines

06:05.765 --> 06:08.700
whip themselves into a frenzy
for pictures

06:08.768 --> 06:11.259
every time Karen gets hitched.

06:11.337 --> 06:12.304
I remember last time.

06:12.405 --> 06:14.339
It was a story unto itself.
The bidding war.

06:14.407 --> 06:17.843
I want you to meet
with these people today.

06:17.910 --> 06:20.276
- Come to an understanding.
- I can do that.

06:20.346 --> 06:25.716
Oh, and in the interests
of the new dispensation,

06:25.818 --> 06:27.718
we could give the money to charity.

06:27.787 --> 06:28.913
Done.

06:33.826 --> 06:35.259
All right.

06:37.196 --> 06:39.562
- To Karen.
- To Karen.

06:43.603 --> 06:46.265
I don't know
how this could have happened.

06:46.339 --> 06:49.365
My assistant usually pays
such assiduous attention

06:49.442 --> 06:52.934
- to every detail.
- Well, here's some details for you.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.503
This wedding is in six hours, and
I have to write a sermon for my sister

06:55.581 --> 06:58.914
and her fourth ex-husband,
so fix the cuffs quickly

06:58.985 --> 07:01.818
so they fit my son
and not an orangutan...

07:03.422 --> 07:06.983
Oh, my God. Excuse me.

07:10.396 --> 07:11.454
Hi, Brian.

07:11.531 --> 07:12.896
Andrea, where the hell have you been?

07:12.965 --> 07:15.627
Brazil. I finally went and
saw iguazú falls,

07:15.701 --> 07:18.761
- and it was a life-changing experience.
- Yeah, it certainly played hell

07:18.838 --> 07:20.669
with your fashion sense.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.708
- I didn't come here to fight.
- Well, then why did you come?

07:22.808 --> 07:24.776
Because the last time I checked,
you dumped our son in my lap

07:24.844 --> 07:27.176
like a half-eaten sandwich
and disappeared.

07:27.246 --> 07:30.079
- I want to talk to him.
- No, not today.

07:30.149 --> 07:31.707
Look, Karen's getting married.
There's a lot going on...

07:31.784 --> 07:33.945
I'm still his mother, Brian.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.448
Just meet me in the rectory in an hour.

07:40.526 --> 07:43.393
Mei ling hwa and the twins
are out of town.

07:49.101 --> 07:53.663
- We have a situation on our hands.
- What's going on?

07:53.739 --> 07:57.266
Karen is having second thoughts,
and I'm quite certain

07:57.343 --> 08:00.403
- that they revolve around you.
- Me?

08:00.479 --> 08:02.106
I... look, I haven't done anything.

08:02.181 --> 08:04.240
Which allows her to live
in this fantasy world

08:04.317 --> 08:07.081
that someday
you two may end up together.

08:08.421 --> 08:12.653
You know this. You must.

08:12.725 --> 08:14.989
All I'm asking is for you to talk to her.

08:15.061 --> 08:18.087
Let her know, once and for all,
that there is no possible future

08:18.164 --> 08:20.098
for her with you. None.

08:23.202 --> 08:25.432
Unless there is.

08:25.504 --> 08:26.630
I'll talk to her.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.641
Good. Then it's quite simple.

08:29.742 --> 08:34.042
Tell her you're not in love with her,
and that you never, ever will be.

09:03.638 --> 09:06.801
Private number? That's so 2006.

09:09.443 --> 09:10.705
- Hello?
Juliet!

09:10.778 --> 09:13.110
- Hey, don't hang up, okay?
- Who is this?

09:13.648 --> 09:16.116
Natalie. Natalie Kimpton.

09:16.183 --> 09:17.514
What do you want?

09:17.585 --> 09:22.318
Listen, just turn the radio station on
to our station, okay? Please.

09:22.924 --> 09:24.084
Never!

09:28.296 --> 09:31.732
Our guest in the studio today
is Natalie Kimpton.

09:31.799 --> 09:34.267
Why don't you tell us
about your new single?

09:34.335 --> 09:38.032
I heard it's quite the vision quest.
That's what I've been told, anyway.

09:38.539 --> 09:40.302
New single? You must be kidding me.

09:40.374 --> 09:43.468
Well, jonesy,
it's called free to forgive,

09:43.544 --> 09:45.102
and it was inspired

09:45.179 --> 09:47.647
by the most devastating experience
of my life,

09:47.982 --> 09:50.348
my break-up with Juliet Darling.

09:51.619 --> 09:53.382
Do you hear what's happening
on the radio?

09:53.454 --> 09:55.684
I sent free to forgive to her
to get her to make up with you!

09:55.756 --> 09:58.623
- Jeremy, I can't hear the song.
- Why do you want to?

09:58.693 --> 10:01.856
That she-devil is evil, Jules!
She is a thief, just like you said.

10:01.963 --> 10:04.523
She pretended to be pregnant to try
and marry me and get my money.

10:04.632 --> 10:07.931
If she's trying to win you back,
it's 'cause she wants something.

10:10.204 --> 10:12.297
Maybe once or twice

10:12.373 --> 10:17.140
but staying mad at me is expensive

10:17.545 --> 10:22.505
and it's free to forgive

10:24.018 --> 10:28.478
and it's free to forgive

10:29.223 --> 10:30.952
kikl: I'm just worried that mom and I
are gonna miss Karen

10:31.025 --> 10:34.984
tossing her bouquet.
I already told all my friends I'd catch it.

10:35.096 --> 10:37.257
It'll be worth, like,
10 million dollars someday.

10:37.365 --> 10:39.799
Kiki, you're gonna get there as soon
as your mom is done at the gallery.

10:39.867 --> 10:41.129
That's the best I can do for you.

10:41.202 --> 10:42.260
Dad!

10:42.336 --> 10:45.100
No. No cater-waiters.
I've known Stella since college.

10:45.172 --> 10:47.800
If anything smacks of elitism,
it'll freak her out.

10:47.875 --> 10:51.367
I want canned beer and potato chips.
Okay, thanks. Bye.

10:51.445 --> 10:52.537
Hi.
- Hi.

10:52.613 --> 10:54.376
You can't wear a tux
to Stella's opening.

10:54.482 --> 10:56.245
Look, I know, but I have to,

10:56.317 --> 10:58.683
because I have to be over
at the imperial right now.

10:58.753 --> 10:59.981
Nick.

11:00.054 --> 11:03.683
You promised you would go with us
to the gallery first.

11:03.758 --> 11:05.055
Look, I have to talk to the press,

11:05.126 --> 11:07.094
I have to pick
which magazine gets the photos,

11:07.161 --> 11:09.026
I have to make sure that the bride
actually gets married.

11:09.096 --> 11:11.257
That's a joke, right?

11:11.365 --> 11:14.425
No. Letitia asked me to make sure
that Karen gets down the aisle.

11:14.502 --> 11:17.665
Apparently, she's having doubts,
cold feet.

11:17.772 --> 11:20.070
Kiki, will you hang this up for me
in the closet, please?

11:20.141 --> 11:22.234
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

11:22.309 --> 11:24.800
She's got cold feet
because of you, right?

11:24.879 --> 11:27.177
According to Letitia, yes,
but she's getting married.

11:27.248 --> 11:29.011
Just not to the man she really wants.

11:29.083 --> 11:31.643
Lisa, the only reason
that I'm not making it to the opening is

11:31.719 --> 11:34.017
so I can go tell Karen to marry Freddy.
You're gonna see for yourself

11:34.088 --> 11:36.352
- in four hours.
- You know what? I really don't need

11:36.424 --> 11:37.721
- to go to this wedding.
- Come on, Lisa. Please.

11:37.792 --> 11:40.317
It's not like Karen and I are close.
And I'm sure there'll be another one.

11:40.394 --> 11:41.418
- So, you know...
- All right. Fine. Don't come.

11:41.495 --> 11:42.792
Okay. Great.

11:44.598 --> 11:45.963
Wait a minute.

11:46.067 --> 11:48.433
If mom doesn't go,
who's gonna take me?

11:48.502 --> 11:50.834
Lisa, come on.

11:50.905 --> 11:53.806
Okay. You can go with your father.

11:53.874 --> 11:56.240
Oh, thank you, God!

11:56.310 --> 11:58.039
You're an evil person.

11:58.112 --> 12:01.604
- You abandoned your son.
- I didn't abandon him.

12:01.682 --> 12:04.651
I left him with his father for two months.

12:04.719 --> 12:07.984
Yeah, and because you did,
my marriage is probably over.

12:08.055 --> 12:10.080
My wife and children have been
in China for two weeks,

12:10.157 --> 12:11.818
and I don't know when,
or if, they're coming back!

12:11.892 --> 12:14.759
Just as a little added bonus
to your little selfish walkabout.

12:14.829 --> 12:16.854
Oh. Look who's talking.

12:16.931 --> 12:19.195
You haven't had a selfless moment
in your life.

12:19.266 --> 12:21.359
Listening to you sob for weeks
about the untimely death

12:21.435 --> 12:24.563
of your mangy cat was pretty selfless,
believe me.

12:24.638 --> 12:26.401
I mean,
why'd you even come back here?

12:26.507 --> 12:28.031
To see my son.

12:32.146 --> 12:33.511
And you.

12:35.483 --> 12:40.352
- Maybe. A little.
- Oh, crap.

12:48.329 --> 12:53.096
Shouldn't you be getting dressed?
The wedding's in less than two hours.

12:53.167 --> 12:55.692
I'll be ready in time, don't worry.

12:57.671 --> 12:59.571
Are you okay?

13:01.709 --> 13:03.768
Look, I know living in this hotel
isn't ideal,

13:03.844 --> 13:07.678
but when the new place is ready, we'll
move in and we'll have a new home.

13:07.748 --> 13:09.716
I'm fine. I like it here.

13:10.851 --> 13:13.615
It feels as much like home
as any place.

13:13.721 --> 13:17.452
Okay. Well, I've...
I've got to run out for a sec.

13:17.525 --> 13:19.993
Don't get lipstick on your collar.

13:24.131 --> 13:25.496
Excuse me?

13:26.367 --> 13:28.927
Or doesn't she wear lipstick?

13:29.036 --> 13:31.061
Am I supposed to be following this?

13:31.138 --> 13:33.834
Because it's all going
way over my head.

13:38.212 --> 13:42.581
So you're not seeing someone else?
A woman? A man? In between?

13:46.554 --> 13:48.021
I don't know what you're...

13:48.088 --> 13:50.852
No, Ellen,
I'm not seeing anyone but you.

13:56.964 --> 13:59.228
- Just go.
- No. What are you talking about?

13:59.300 --> 14:01.564
- What...
- Just go.

14:15.583 --> 14:19.314
Hey, Karen.
Everyone's looking for you.

14:19.386 --> 14:22.617
Well, looks like you found me.

14:22.690 --> 14:27.127
That's Nick, one. Everyone else, zero.

14:29.697 --> 14:30.823
Can I ask you a question?

14:30.898 --> 14:33.833
- Sure.
- I don't think I'm gonna do this.

14:33.901 --> 14:35.664
Well, that's technically not a question.

14:35.736 --> 14:38.432
- I know. I answered it myself.
- You did.

14:38.505 --> 14:39.472
Mmm.

14:40.274 --> 14:44.643
You don't think me marrying Freddy
is a huge mistake?

14:44.745 --> 14:47.771
Like... the hugest?

14:51.919 --> 14:54.752
Look, Karen, if you're hoping
I'm gonna sweep you off your feet

14:54.822 --> 14:57.052
and tell you not to marry Freddy,
I can't.

14:57.124 --> 14:59.251
Nick, this isn't about you.

15:01.395 --> 15:04.023
My entire life doesn't revolve
around a stupid crush I had

15:04.098 --> 15:08.034
when I was 18. This is about Freddy,
and if he's the right one for me.

15:08.102 --> 15:09.933
- Okay.
- I just wanted to get your opinion.

15:10.004 --> 15:11.062
That's all.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.334
Okay.

15:19.380 --> 15:20.347
Hey.

15:20.447 --> 15:22.108
Have you pre-sold
my wedding photos yet?

15:22.182 --> 15:23.206
Not yet.

15:23.284 --> 15:25.445
Well, don't settle
for less than two million.

15:25.519 --> 15:27.146
That would suck.

15:51.373 --> 15:54.206
- Paddy, my boy!
- "Paddy, my boy"?

15:54.276 --> 15:56.767
Well, I believe
that is an appropriate greeting.

15:56.845 --> 16:00.212
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Lower your voice. I'm not deaf.

16:00.282 --> 16:02.147
You told Ellen about Carmelita.

16:02.217 --> 16:05.584
I did nothing of the sort.
And I am offended

16:05.688 --> 16:07.952
that you would even think
that I would do such a thing.

16:08.023 --> 16:10.150
Well, maybe that's because
you hired a private investigator

16:10.225 --> 16:12.159
to follow me around
and take photographs!

16:12.227 --> 16:13.854
I was trying to save your marriage.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.760
- Is that right?
- I love you, son.

16:15.831 --> 16:19.494
Whatever nonsense has come
between us doesn't change that.

16:21.236 --> 16:24.603
Now, come on. Have a drink.

16:26.008 --> 16:29.967
Your sister's getting married.
It's a great day.

16:35.985 --> 16:38.044
Dad, this place is a palace.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.020
It's a little like one.

16:40.789 --> 16:41.847
Come on in.

16:41.924 --> 16:44.893
Excuse me. Hello there, young lady.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.621
- Hi.
- Kiki, right?

16:46.695 --> 16:48.219
- Yeah.
- This is Kiki.

16:48.297 --> 16:51.858
- I'm Mrs. Darling.
- And I'm Tripp Darling.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.333
- Your house is so beautiful.
- Thank you.

16:54.436 --> 16:58.668
Well, maybe you'll bless us
by having your wedding here someday.

16:58.741 --> 17:01.904
- I really could?
- Oh, yes, of course you can.

17:01.977 --> 17:04.877
Your dad is family.

17:04.945 --> 17:07.040
Thank you for taking care
of things today, Nick.

17:07.116 --> 17:10.608
- I appreciate it.
- It was no problem. It was... it was fine.

17:10.685 --> 17:13.211
Are the photographers here yet?
I asked them to get here early.

17:13.288 --> 17:18.385
The vultures of the tabloids
are in my office even as we speak.

17:18.460 --> 17:20.483
50,000.
- Uh, who are you, again?

17:20.560 --> 17:21.586
Style and grace.

17:21.663 --> 17:24.223
Well, style and grace, I'd like
to remind you that the bidding starts

17:24.299 --> 17:26.267
at one million dollars.

17:26.335 --> 17:28.860
Guys, I want to remind you,
this is Karen Darling.

17:28.937 --> 17:31.497
- On her fourth wedding.
- To a second-rate golfer.

17:31.573 --> 17:33.700
The public's hungry for access,
but they're not starving.

17:33.776 --> 17:37.542
Well, this could be her last wedding,
and the bidding starts at one million.

17:37.613 --> 17:40.446
- I think I've been clear.
- Then I think I'll skedaddle.

17:40.516 --> 17:42.882
- Good luck, guys.
- See you.

17:42.951 --> 17:44.475
$500,000.

17:45.654 --> 17:47.622
Is he...

17:47.723 --> 17:50.385
- 400,000?
- Okay, I'll give you 250.

17:50.459 --> 17:54.486
- Sold!
- But, I'm gonna need a little... s-k-I-n.

17:54.563 --> 17:56.394
I'm 10. I can spell.

17:56.465 --> 17:58.433
I'll go 350 if I can tag along
for the honeymoon

17:58.534 --> 18:01.298
and get some... oplesstay actionay?

18:01.370 --> 18:04.134
I speak pig Latin, too, ummyday.

18:05.707 --> 18:07.971
Dad, look, the wedding's starting.

18:08.043 --> 18:12.002
We're gonna make it. Okay, guys.
Listen, no skin and no honeymoon.

18:12.114 --> 18:15.140
- Then nothing over 200.
- Okay, you can have some honeymoon.

18:15.217 --> 18:16.548
- I'll go three.
- Sold!

18:18.720 --> 18:21.883
- Here we are again.
- Here we are.

18:23.592 --> 18:27.119
You know, there's a word
for how I feel right now.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.024
Whoa.

18:33.102 --> 18:34.763
It's a Japanese word.

18:34.837 --> 18:37.397
It means, "reverence

18:38.373 --> 18:44.937
"for the transient beauty
and mortality of all things. "

18:47.716 --> 18:53.586
- Daddy, you're so wasted.
- I know I am.

18:53.655 --> 18:54.883
I know.

18:54.957 --> 18:59.485
You realize that on this day

19:00.596 --> 19:03.622
in a father's life

19:03.699 --> 19:09.069
grief and joy are intertwined.

19:09.138 --> 19:11.504
Oh, and remember...

19:11.640 --> 19:12.937
Be kind.

19:14.476 --> 19:15.738
Be fair.

19:17.012 --> 19:18.172
And...

19:19.915 --> 19:22.475
- Be true?
- Be true.

19:22.551 --> 19:24.416
And... uh...

19:24.486 --> 19:26.920
Daddy, it's okay.

19:26.989 --> 19:29.082
You don't have to finish it.
I know the whole thing.

19:29.158 --> 19:32.252
But you know something?
I really believe

19:32.327 --> 19:35.888
that this time it's going to last

19:37.966 --> 19:39.729
for quite some time.

19:41.003 --> 19:42.971
- Be patient!
- Be patient.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.901
Thank you, daddy.

19:47.976 --> 19:50.308
- May I have this walk?
- You may.

20:07.196 --> 20:09.528
I gotta know

20:09.598 --> 20:11.759
did you come here for the money?

20:11.867 --> 20:13.835
I gotta know

20:13.936 --> 20:15.961
or did you come to see a show?

20:16.038 --> 20:17.733
I gotta know

20:17.806 --> 20:19.967
did you come to party
with your people?

20:20.342 --> 20:22.242
Or did you come here

20:22.311 --> 20:25.474
'cause there's no place left to go?

20:41.129 --> 20:43.256
Everybody, please sit down.

20:48.870 --> 20:51.930
And so, Karen, Freddy.

20:52.941 --> 20:57.002
I send you off
into the mystery of marriage

20:57.079 --> 21:00.105
with three words that start
with the letter "c."

21:00.182 --> 21:02.309
First.

21:02.384 --> 21:04.249
"Confirmation. "

21:04.319 --> 21:06.879
Married people provide confirmation
for each other.

21:06.955 --> 21:11.619
When one person sees
a shooting star or an aurora,

21:11.693 --> 21:14.719
then they have someone
to turn to, all the time,

21:14.796 --> 21:17.560
to whom to which to say,
"did you see that?

21:17.633 --> 21:20.397
"Did that really happen?"

21:20.469 --> 21:23.700
And in a life that's full
of amazing moments,

21:23.772 --> 21:26.468
it's important to have

21:26.541 --> 21:28.031
confirmation.

21:29.244 --> 21:31.303
The second is "consolation. "

21:32.581 --> 21:35.209
Married people provide consolation
for each other

21:35.284 --> 21:39.243
when bad luck, death
or even the simple sadness

21:39.321 --> 21:41.789
of the passing of beauty
becomes hard to make it go on,

21:41.857 --> 21:44.758
then you have someone to turn to

21:44.826 --> 21:48.660
for a hand, for an embrace,

21:48.730 --> 21:52.291
for a kiss, for consolation.

21:52.367 --> 21:54.835
And last but not least...

21:57.839 --> 21:59.272
There's "joy. "

22:02.811 --> 22:07.771
It's not a "c" word,
but then, life and love are surprising.

22:07.883 --> 22:09.817
You may kiss the bride.

22:14.423 --> 22:16.721
Oh, my God.
I feel like a prisoner in here.

22:17.192 --> 22:19.717
Karen, before we go
into all that madness,

22:19.795 --> 22:21.695
I need to tell you something.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.331
What are you doing?

22:26.401 --> 22:29.893
When I first proposed to you,
I didn't love you.

22:29.971 --> 22:31.996
- Oh, that's okay.
- No, listen.

22:32.074 --> 22:35.441
I just... I saw this world,
and I wanted to be a part of it.

22:35.544 --> 22:38.479
Freddy, honey, it's okay. I get it.

22:38.547 --> 22:41.880
But during the ceremony,
and hearing those vows, I realized

22:41.950 --> 22:44.418
that I have fallen in love with you.

22:44.653 --> 22:48.214
And none of the superficial stuff,
the money, whatever...

22:49.524 --> 22:51.287
Matters to me anymore.

22:54.763 --> 22:56.731
- I want to propose.
- You already did.

22:56.832 --> 22:58.390
I want to do it again.

22:59.201 --> 23:05.162
Karen Darling Mason, I want to
spend the rest of my life with you.

23:09.611 --> 23:10.703
Oh...

23:12.948 --> 23:19.217
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you, too, baby... forever.

23:20.155 --> 23:25.422
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present
to you Mr. and Mrs. Freddy Mason!

23:25.494 --> 23:28.258
All right, Freddy! Yeah!

23:42.544 --> 23:45.411
I want a divorce. Now.

24:00.991 --> 24:02.822
Tell me this is some kind of joke.

24:02.893 --> 24:05.726
I told you I was having
second thoughts. I told you both!

24:05.796 --> 24:09.357
Karen Darling, you are not going out
there and announcing your divorce

24:09.433 --> 24:10.730
during your wedding.

24:10.801 --> 24:13.770
Of course not!
I would never ruin a party.

24:13.870 --> 24:16.304
Karen, you've been married for less
than an hour. Is it possible...

24:16.373 --> 24:20.139
I can tell when these things
won't work out, Nick. I'm a pro.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.178
You're an embarrassment,
is what you are.

24:22.245 --> 24:23.303
You think this makes me happy?

24:23.380 --> 24:25.871
Because the last time I checked,
being a four-time divorcée

24:25.949 --> 24:27.644
wasn't exactly a big selling point!

24:27.718 --> 24:29.811
Then why'd you go through with it
in the first place?

24:29.886 --> 24:33.117
- Because you told me to!
- Karen, listen to me.

24:33.190 --> 24:35.158
While Freddy may not be
the perfect man,

24:35.225 --> 24:40.788
he is as capable and deserving a
fourth husband as you're likely to find.

24:42.399 --> 24:44.162
Tables 7 and 8 are filled with lawyers.

24:44.234 --> 24:45.792
Am I going to have to go out there
and hire one of them,

24:45.869 --> 24:47.302
or are you going to
take care of this for me?

24:47.371 --> 24:49.931
- I will talk to Freddy.
- Thank you.

24:51.108 --> 24:53.042
Now I can go outside and
have my father-daughter dance.

24:53.110 --> 24:55.476
- Karen?
- Yeah. What? I need a drink.

24:55.579 --> 24:56.876
Let's all just agree that

24:56.947 --> 25:00.178
your father doesn't need to
know about this right now.

25:00.250 --> 25:03.083
Let him have his night. He's so happy.

25:03.153 --> 25:06.714
I know. And I wish I had it in me
to stay married just for him...

25:07.257 --> 25:08.417
But I don't.

25:14.631 --> 25:16.360
Well, I hope you're happy.

25:21.304 --> 25:22.669
Well, your honor,
the seven deadly sins

25:22.773 --> 25:23.933
are not like the constitution.

25:24.040 --> 25:27.908
They can't be amended.
So if I were you, yes, I'd be worried.

25:28.011 --> 25:30.070
- May I?
- Of course.

25:33.016 --> 25:37.180
Brian. What a wonderful
wedding sermon.

25:38.054 --> 25:42.218
So much humanity, so much hope.

25:42.359 --> 25:49.356
There really is such a kind person
buried deep down inside you.

25:50.367 --> 25:52.733
Deep, deep down.

25:54.404 --> 25:56.531
Inside you.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.697
Somewhere.

25:59.576 --> 26:01.043
Thanks, dad.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.038
So, how is it being a Darling?

26:05.115 --> 26:08.881
I'm pretty new at it,
but I guess it's okay. The food's good.

26:09.886 --> 26:13.549
Well, when I grow up,
I'm going to live just like this.

26:14.458 --> 26:17.825
No matter what it takes.
No matter what.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.058
This is nice, right?

26:26.269 --> 26:27.429
We don't dance enough.

26:27.504 --> 26:29.165
Would dancing satisfy you?

26:29.239 --> 26:30.866
Would dancing give you
whatever it is that you...

26:30.941 --> 26:32.033
Ellen, I don't want to...

26:32.108 --> 26:33.268
Smile!

26:33.844 --> 26:36.404
There. There's a nice fake picture.
I hope everybody in the fake world

26:36.480 --> 26:39.142
- likes fake-looking at it.
- You know what?

26:39.216 --> 26:42.515
I am not going to do this. I can't.

26:43.653 --> 26:45.211
I'm gonna get a drink.

26:47.824 --> 26:49.883
It's an annulment.

26:50.393 --> 26:51.917
Freddy, per Karen's request,

26:51.995 --> 26:53.963
I've prepared all the necessary
legal documents.

26:54.030 --> 26:57.056
There's a judge at table number seven.
He's ready to sign.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.493
But I still get the check, right?

27:00.470 --> 27:02.631
Of course, baby. I made a vow.

27:02.739 --> 27:07.005
You will still receive the full divorce
settlement as specified in the prenup.

27:07.077 --> 27:11.912
Three million dollars.

27:13.049 --> 27:16.985
All you have to do is sign right there.

27:26.596 --> 27:27.961
Done.

27:33.336 --> 27:34.826
You must be ecstatic.

27:37.507 --> 27:40.442
- Freddy, I never meant...
- Karen, please.

27:40.911 --> 27:44.540
Don't feel sorry for me, okay?
I feel sorry for you.

27:44.614 --> 27:48.550
Because you are a screwed up little girl
who has a thing for her lawyer.

27:49.185 --> 27:51.653
And no matter how hard
you try and fight it,

27:51.721 --> 27:53.882
you are going to die
alone and unhappy.

27:53.957 --> 27:56.517
And that's exactly what you deserve.

28:00.297 --> 28:03.733
- Hey. Listen, Karen, he's just...
- Nick, don't, okay?

28:04.935 --> 28:06.869
Just don't. Don't.

28:08.939 --> 28:10.566
I'm sorry, Karen.

28:23.486 --> 28:25.647
So, what's the matter?

28:27.691 --> 28:30.922
Well, I came here to discuss with you
a highly sensitive matter,

28:30.994 --> 28:33.724
but I realize perhaps
now's not the best time.

28:33.797 --> 28:38.063
Pat, I had a cup of chai tea.
I'm going to be up all night. Talk to me.

28:38.868 --> 28:44.033
Well, I have this acquaintance
for whom I care a great deal.

28:44.374 --> 28:45.534
A mistress?

28:45.809 --> 28:49.438
She... used to be a mister.

28:52.582 --> 28:55.312
It's none of my business
how you like your eggs.

28:55.652 --> 28:58.985
Well, I... I appreciate that. But...

28:59.055 --> 29:03.151
You see, Ellen... she keeps asking
all sorts of questions, and...

29:03.226 --> 29:07.162
She knows something,
and I just can't... I just can't keep lying.

29:07.631 --> 29:08.996
Then stop lying.

29:09.633 --> 29:11.533
In fact, I think it's time

29:11.601 --> 29:14.661
for Patrick Darling to stop
apologizing for being himself.

29:15.605 --> 29:17.163
I mean, come on, it's the 21 st century.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.401
People's hearts and minds are open.

29:19.509 --> 29:21.033
They're tired of the politics
of deception.

29:21.111 --> 29:24.842
They're starved for truth,
and I'll bet Ellen is the same.

29:25.248 --> 29:26.806
But if I tell Ellen the truth, she...

29:26.883 --> 29:29.909
You know, she might leave me,
and that could ruin my campaign.

29:29.986 --> 29:32.955
I think Ellen's smarter
than you give her credit for.

29:33.390 --> 29:36.689
So you think I should just tell her
the truth? Just confess everything?

29:37.093 --> 29:39.254
It's not a confession,
it's a conversation.

29:39.329 --> 29:41.354
And it's the right thing to do
for your marriage.

29:41.431 --> 29:44.730
For your country. And for your soul.

29:50.340 --> 29:55.437
Okay... okay, great. Thank you.

29:56.346 --> 29:58.871
- Thank you.
- Okay.

30:01.117 --> 30:02.675
I'm proud of you, pat.

30:03.053 --> 30:04.953
I appreciate your discretion.

30:06.322 --> 30:07.550
It's all good.

30:11.961 --> 30:13.394
Good night.

30:40.090 --> 30:42.024
Quite a roller-coaster today.

30:42.325 --> 30:47.695
- Yeah. I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't worry about me.

30:47.897 --> 30:50.365
And I managed to sell those pictures
for $ 1.3 million.

30:50.433 --> 30:53.266
- That's nothing to sneeze at.
- Yeah, that's nice.

30:54.204 --> 30:55.535
I still matter.

30:57.674 --> 30:59.835
So you want to tell me
what really happened?

30:59.909 --> 31:01.467
He told me he loved me.

31:02.312 --> 31:04.940
Right after the ceremony,
he just spit it out.

31:05.014 --> 31:07.574
- And that wasn't good?
- I don't know.

31:08.952 --> 31:13.389
When I thought Freddy was in it
only for the money, it...

31:13.456 --> 31:16.118
It somehow made it okay. You know?

31:16.493 --> 31:17.926
He was easier to deal with.

31:17.994 --> 31:20.895
I knew he'd always be there because
the money would always be there.

31:20.964 --> 31:25.663
- And then it got real.
- Yeah. More real, anyway.

31:27.704 --> 31:29.467
But then after he said
those horrible things to me

31:29.572 --> 31:33.941
at the divorce, it just proved that
I did the right thing.

31:34.010 --> 31:37.377
- Well, he was wrong. He was hurt...
- He was right about one thing.

31:40.183 --> 31:42.151
I am in love with you.

31:46.556 --> 31:47.716
Karen...

31:51.995 --> 31:54.463
You know we belong together.

31:54.531 --> 31:59.594
We've both known it
since we were kids. We fit.

32:03.773 --> 32:05.638
I've gotta go.

32:20.287 --> 32:26.123
Doomed from here to eternity

32:27.027 --> 32:33.956
lord have mercy on such as we

32:34.901 --> 32:40.168
baa, baa, baa

32:51.751 --> 32:53.048
bone dry.

32:54.521 --> 32:56.887
That was a beautiful wedding day.

32:57.657 --> 33:00.217
Karen finally got it right.

33:00.860 --> 33:06.230
I'll sleep well tonight, knowing
that she has found a man's heart

33:06.299 --> 33:08.733
in which to make her home.

33:11.738 --> 33:13.467
Daddy, can I talk to you?

33:19.412 --> 33:23.348
Oh, I think we might have
set a record here.

33:26.386 --> 33:28.217
- How was the opening?
- Amazing.

33:28.288 --> 33:29.380
Good.

33:30.423 --> 33:32.653
- Amazing!
- Excellent.

33:32.726 --> 33:34.785
Stella's paintings sold out in one hour.

33:34.861 --> 33:37.591
She is now passed out drunk
on my office couch with some

33:37.664 --> 33:40.132
Cuban shortstop
who's just defected to the Yankees.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.633
Well, congratulations.

33:41.701 --> 33:42.929
Thank you.

33:44.971 --> 33:47.531
- So how was the wedding?
- It was all right.

33:47.607 --> 33:49.666
Karen's wedding photos sold
for 300 grand,

33:49.743 --> 33:52.405
so the Darling family foundation
only had to kick in a cool mill

33:52.479 --> 33:54.140
to protect her feelings.

33:54.414 --> 33:55.881
That's kind of sad.

33:56.182 --> 33:57.809
Yeah.

33:58.184 --> 34:00.448
So she actually went through with it?

34:00.754 --> 34:04.121
And then, 45 minutes later,
she got through with it.

34:05.725 --> 34:06.987
What?

34:07.861 --> 34:10.125
Karen had the marriage annulled.

34:10.896 --> 34:12.262
I wonder why.

34:13.465 --> 34:15.764
Well, it had nothing to do with me,
if that's what you're implying.

34:15.835 --> 34:17.860
Of course it didn't, Nick.

34:18.371 --> 34:20.838
- Hey, Lisa. Would you wait?
- I'm tired.

34:20.907 --> 34:22.875
I know. I know, and I'm tired, too.

34:22.942 --> 34:25.409
But I just... I want all of this to stop.

34:26.146 --> 34:27.875
I love you,

34:28.715 --> 34:30.683
and that is never going to change.

34:30.849 --> 34:34.581
I don't know how many times
I have to say this. I'm yours.

34:36.656 --> 34:37.679
One more time.

34:37.757 --> 34:39.281
I'm yours.

34:57.777 --> 34:59.802
I'm going shopping on Madison.

34:59.879 --> 35:01.574
It's Carmelita.

35:06.886 --> 35:12.017
- Excuse me?
- Her name is Carmelita.

35:15.528 --> 35:16.893
Do you love her?

35:18.098 --> 35:21.727
I love... I love you both.

35:24.904 --> 35:28.169
I can't give her up. I've tried. I...
I don't know how.

35:30.143 --> 35:31.610
Well, then.

35:32.645 --> 35:34.579
We don't have a choice, do we?

35:37.617 --> 35:40.950
The three of us are going to sit down
together and set some ground rules.

35:41.020 --> 35:42.851
The three of us?

35:42.922 --> 35:46.449
You, me, and... you, me, and who?

35:47.360 --> 35:48.918
Carmelita.

35:50.063 --> 35:53.430
She won't destroy this marriage,
and she will not keep us

35:53.533 --> 35:56.058
out of Washington, either one of us.

35:57.137 --> 35:59.867
I didn't marry a Darling for nothing.

36:07.514 --> 36:10.210
Bingles! Bingles! Wait for me!

36:12.218 --> 36:13.651
Bingles!

36:15.522 --> 36:18.980
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, look what I got.

36:19.826 --> 36:20.952
Ta-da!

36:21.261 --> 36:22.228
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

36:22.896 --> 36:25.524
Hey, will you tell germs
that we're friends again?

36:25.598 --> 36:28.032
I think we should tell the whole world!

36:32.672 --> 36:34.003
He's in here.

36:34.841 --> 36:36.172
Hi.

36:36.776 --> 36:38.107
Hey.

36:38.511 --> 36:39.876
Where's Brian Jr?

36:39.979 --> 36:42.243
He's at a fencing lesson,
but he'll be back.

36:42.315 --> 36:43.805
He's getting really good at it.
You know, I think

36:43.883 --> 36:46.750
- if he has a few more...
- I'm taking him back to Brazil.

36:50.323 --> 36:51.347
What?

36:51.424 --> 36:54.359
Yeah, I realized this morning
when I woke up in queens.

36:54.427 --> 36:58.727
I went to Brazil to find myself,
but I think I found a home, too.

36:59.332 --> 37:00.356
In the jungle?

37:00.433 --> 37:02.367
No. In são Paulo.

37:02.435 --> 37:04.266
What about Brian Jr?

37:04.637 --> 37:06.298
What about maple grove?

37:06.372 --> 37:08.932
He's going to start in the fall. You can't
just come in here and uproot him.

37:09.042 --> 37:10.509
He has a life here now.

37:10.577 --> 37:13.546
I'm sure we can find him
a fencing coach down there.

37:14.280 --> 37:17.443
And you'll pay for it, if you want him
to live in the manner to which

37:17.517 --> 37:21.749
he's become so quickly
and completely accustomed.

37:22.355 --> 37:25.188
Did you really think
I'd let you keep him forever?

37:26.993 --> 37:28.483
Mommy!

37:28.595 --> 37:34.033
- Hi! Oh, I missed you!
- I missed you, too.

37:48.137 --> 37:50.697
- Patrick.
- Hello, dad.

37:59.114 --> 38:00.479
Where's Ellen?

38:01.383 --> 38:05.479
Are things okay with the two of you?
Fences mended?

38:05.621 --> 38:07.145
They're on their way.

38:10.125 --> 38:14.289
- So this is where you're living.
- For the time being.

38:17.232 --> 38:18.392
Let me reiterate.

38:18.467 --> 38:23.905
I had nothing to do with Ellen
finding out, absolutely nothing at all.

38:23.972 --> 38:27.999
Is that why you came here, dad?
To convince me of your innocence?

38:28.076 --> 38:30.135
I came to tell you I loved you,

38:30.212 --> 38:32.373
and that you're always welcome
under my roof,

38:32.481 --> 38:37.384
regardless of whatever business
disagreements we might have.

38:38.854 --> 38:41.118
I feel bad I let it go this far.

38:42.057 --> 38:48.758
I... the point is,
if you get tired of hotel living,

38:48.897 --> 38:51.957
the fourth floor of the imperial
is always waiting.

38:52.367 --> 38:56.701
I appreciate that, dad, thank you,
but we found a place over on the park.

38:57.739 --> 38:59.673
Where exactly?

39:00.809 --> 39:02.470
The octavius.

39:02.778 --> 39:04.746
Simon elder owns that building.

39:05.914 --> 39:09.145
I know, dad. He suggested it.

39:09.751 --> 39:12.015
We move in, in two weeks.

39:16.692 --> 39:19.957
- Do I really have to go to Brazil?
- You're not going to Brazil yet,

39:20.028 --> 39:21.962
you're just going to queens
with your mom.

39:22.030 --> 39:24.726
Do they have lemon curd in queens?

39:25.234 --> 39:27.168
I'll send a jar home with you.

39:27.569 --> 39:30.629
And there'll always be plenty here
when you come visit.

39:32.975 --> 39:35.034
Are you sure she'll let me visit?

39:36.378 --> 39:39.836
I'm going to do everything in my power
to make sure that she does.

39:41.383 --> 39:43.351
Let's go, sweetie.

39:46.722 --> 39:48.280
Don't pack just yet.

39:50.559 --> 39:51.719
Bye, daddy.

39:58.033 --> 39:59.398
Bye, little man.

40:02.738 --> 40:04.865
What in God's name is this?

40:04.940 --> 40:09.309
Oh, just some sock Freddy wanted
to sell to kids as part of a golf video.

40:09.378 --> 40:13.212
Oh. Maybe he wasn't a keeper.

40:13.615 --> 40:16.140
Last night I told Nick
that he and I belong together,

40:16.218 --> 40:17.776
and then I kissed him.

40:17.886 --> 40:18.978
Oh, Karen.

40:19.054 --> 40:22.888
I know. I know, but I just got
so caught up in the moment.

40:22.958 --> 40:25.324
You know, the wedding
made me feel so romantic.

40:25.394 --> 40:28.022
Yeah, but why do you
do this to yourself?

40:29.698 --> 40:31.598
Because I want to marry Nick.

40:32.567 --> 40:34.432
Don't I have to try?

40:35.304 --> 40:39.263
I can't go the rest of my life wondering
what might have happened, can I?

40:39.975 --> 40:45.504
Well, no. No. No, no, you can't. I...

40:45.580 --> 40:46.706
I just...

40:46.782 --> 40:50.479
Mom, that's a candle. You can't...
Let's... there you go.

40:58.026 --> 41:00.051
I'll just ask you for one thing.

41:00.329 --> 41:01.626
What's that?

41:03.932 --> 41:05.422
Let me help you.

41:11.673 --> 41:15.700
He has stolen my son.

41:16.745 --> 41:18.838
Patrick is a person, Tripp.

41:19.781 --> 41:22.716
Making his own choices.
This isn't about theft.

41:22.784 --> 41:27.744
There are so many spurious
assumptions behind that statement...

41:27.856 --> 41:31.019
Tripp, do you know that
Patrick is working with Simon?

41:31.126 --> 41:33.492
He's living in Simon elder's building.

41:33.562 --> 41:37.623
Ostensibly, to all intents and purposes,
Simon elder is serving Patrick

41:37.699 --> 41:40.862
in some sort of all-encompassing
advisory capacity,

41:40.969 --> 41:43.836
and I am certain that it is Simon elder

41:43.905 --> 41:46.999
who is behind paddy's push
to indict my friends.

41:47.709 --> 41:49.734
I'm not a vengeful person, Nick.

41:50.579 --> 41:53.605
I have endured massive betrayal,

41:54.049 --> 41:59.009
and I have responded with patience
and with love.

42:01.590 --> 42:04.559
But I will not suffer this man.

42:11.032 --> 42:12.659
What do you want to do?

42:16.371 --> 42:18.271
I want to destroy him.

42:25.204 --> 42:32.420
I want that son of a bitch
completely and utterly destroyed.
