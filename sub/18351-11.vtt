00:02.004 --> 00:06.012
So today the girls are
doing the PSA for my SlutWalk. I
really would like to see the
pain and the struggle

00:06.012 --> 00:09.085
but also make it
very beautiful.

00:09.085 --> 00:11.123
We as women stand united.

00:11.123 --> 00:14.495
They're a little
too happy.

00:14.495 --> 00:15.598
You are going to be
embodying some of the most
iconic,

00:15.598 --> 00:16.767
boss ladies
in pop culture history.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.774
That's fab.

00:19.774 --> 00:20.775
Tash:nHaving my sister
back, it isNreally, really hard
for me.

00:20.775 --> 00:24.282
Even that's fab.

00:24.282 --> 00:25.551
Drew:nPaige, it was
hardNto get her out

00:25.551 --> 00:27.822
of beingnthe
rah-rah cheerleader.

00:27.822 --> 00:30.026
Paige, the judges think
your photos are one-note,

00:30.026 --> 00:32.999
so congratulations
Coryanne.

00:32.999 --> 00:35.705
So sorry, Paige.

01:24.235 --> 01:25.437
<i>So cute.</i>

01:25.437 --> 01:26.272
Legit, you look
like Katy Perry, dude.

01:26.272 --> 01:28.878
She looks gorgeous.

01:28.878 --> 01:30.414
Like a bomb version
of Katy Perry's
hotter little sister.

01:30.414 --> 01:32.619
<i>India's competition,
and she takes amazing photos</i>

01:32.619 --> 01:36.225
and the judges
are obsessed with her,

01:36.225 --> 01:37.963
<i>but in terms of star
quality, I don't really see it
yet.</i>

01:37.963 --> 01:39.866
She's just, like, not, like,
super interesting to me.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.837
Check out that glowon Miss Tina.

01:44.441 --> 01:44.943
It was a tie
between India and I.

01:49.352 --> 01:51.557
<i>The idea that two
people can win best photo</i>

01:51.557 --> 01:53.093
really just made me want
to hold onto the idea

01:53.093 --> 01:56.099
of Cody and I being able
to win this

01:56.099 --> 01:58.705
together as a brand.

01:58.705 --> 01:59.806
Look at the fingers.
Like, I'm such a details person.

01:59.806 --> 02:00.975
Like, even just that.
Love it.

02:02.311 --> 02:02.779
I am crazy about hands.

02:07.054 --> 02:09.726
I know that my photo
was better Tash's.

02:09.726 --> 02:12.397
I don't have to cheer her
on and let her steal my thunder.

02:12.397 --> 02:15.805
<i>Growing up, I was kind
of the outcast a little bit.</i>

02:15.805 --> 02:18.878
<i>I was a tomboy.</i>

02:18.878 --> 02:20.047
<i>I always felt
like Tash</i>

02:20.047 --> 02:22.151
got the validation
that she needed

02:22.151 --> 02:24.489
inside the family, and I
had to go elsewhere for it.

02:24.489 --> 02:26.661
<i>I do feel like
modeling, acting has been my
thing,</i>

02:26.661 --> 02:28.931
<i>and she's scared that
somehow I'm gonna get so good t
it</i>

02:28.931 --> 02:31.269
<i>and I'm gonna
leave her behind</i>

02:31.269 --> 02:32.839
<i>and that's why
she wants to do it,</i>

02:32.839 --> 02:34.008
and I can't let her
take this from me

02:34.008 --> 02:36.847
like she's taken
everything else from me.

02:36.847 --> 02:38.750
<i>I'm gonna keep
being amazing,</i>

02:38.750 --> 02:39.953
because who's been
in the top three

02:39.953 --> 02:41.590
this entire competition?
Me.

02:41.590 --> 02:43.193
It's crazy how once
you start doing well--

02:43.193 --> 02:46.099
I have such high standards
for myself.

02:46.099 --> 02:48.504
Mm-hmm. It's becoming
way more stressful.

02:48.504 --> 02:50.908
I think my biggest
competition is India,

02:50.908 --> 02:53.615
<i>but at the
same time,</i>

02:53.615 --> 02:55.150
<i>she's the only girl
in the house</i>

02:55.150 --> 02:57.121
<i>who I really,
fully connect with.</i>

02:57.121 --> 02:59.291
<i>Our personalities
vibe very well.</i>

02:59.291 --> 03:00.493
I don't know, it's nice to have
<i>a friend in this house.</i>

03:03.668 --> 03:08.376
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

03:08.376 --> 03:10.314
- Uh, what?
- <i>Somebody's here.</i>

03:10.314 --> 03:12.786
Oh, my God. I
have anxiety.

03:12.786 --> 03:13.521
- Who's here?
- Oh, no.

03:13.521 --> 03:14.722
( screams )

03:17.629 --> 03:18.965
You guys got time
for a little guest?

03:18.965 --> 03:19.900
Our bell rings,
and Rita Ora is at our door.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.206
Hello!

03:23.206 --> 03:25.511
- Oh, my God!
- <i>So welcome to our crib.</i>

03:25.511 --> 03:26.880
<i>Oh, my God.Look at all
these floorsyou guys got.</i>

03:26.880 --> 03:28.884
So take me ona little tour.

03:30.888 --> 03:35.497
Don't judge us.

03:35.497 --> 03:37.001
Oh, my God.
This is so clean, guys.

03:37.001 --> 03:39.171
- Yeah, right?
- It's a joke.

03:39.171 --> 03:40.374
- <i>Not that bad.</i>
- It's so clean.

03:40.374 --> 03:42.578
<i>( laughter )</i>

03:42.578 --> 03:44.048
I'm so excited
to actually get to know Rita,

03:44.048 --> 03:46.018
<i>because out of all
of the judges,</i>

03:46.018 --> 03:47.421
I really haven't had
the chance or the time

03:47.421 --> 03:49.993
to really talk to her.

03:49.993 --> 03:51.429
Here is wherewe
take our selfies.

03:51.429 --> 03:53.768
Rita:I wanna do one.

03:53.768 --> 03:54.769
- ( laughter )
- No, I wasn't ready!

03:54.769 --> 03:57.642
Rita's a huge inspiration,

03:57.642 --> 03:59.078
<i>and she's closer
to our age,</i>

03:59.078 --> 04:00.882
so she's so relatable
to everyone in this house.

04:00.882 --> 04:02.585
Rita: <i>Okay, so I
saw one bedroom.</i>

04:02.585 --> 04:05.224
This is our room.

04:05.224 --> 04:06.727
Oh, my God.
This literally looks
like a tour bus.

04:06.727 --> 04:08.597
<i>This is cute.</i>

04:08.597 --> 04:10.234
What a day, huh?

04:10.234 --> 04:11.770
- I'm so exhausted.
- <i>Story time.</i>

04:11.770 --> 04:13.708
Okay,
so thanks for having me.

04:13.708 --> 04:17.616
Thank you for being here.

04:17.616 --> 04:19.451
So I wanted to come here
because I feel like you guys

04:19.451 --> 04:20.622
haven't actually got
to know me one on one yet.

04:20.622 --> 04:23.359
<i>Yeah.</i>

04:23.359 --> 04:24.529
And these final few moments
that we have with each other,

04:24.529 --> 04:27.769
'cause there are
really a few left,

04:27.769 --> 04:30.040
and they're going quicker
than I ever imagined,

04:30.040 --> 04:32.177
and it's like, "Now it's time
for me to go see these girls,"

04:32.177 --> 04:34.716
'cause nobody
came to see me.

04:34.716 --> 04:37.121
Nobody.
Not even my parents.

04:37.121 --> 04:39.024
Aw.

04:39.024 --> 04:40.527
Rita:I see so muchof
you guys in me,

04:40.527 --> 04:42.765
and I see so much
of myself in you.

04:42.765 --> 04:45.137
When I was 17, I moved
to New York City on my own.

04:45.137 --> 04:48.978
My parents were, like,
literally not talking to me,

04:48.978 --> 04:51.315
'cause they thought,
"There's no way in hell

04:51.315 --> 04:53.654
this girl's gonna
not get an education,"

04:53.654 --> 04:55.123
and I just thought,"That
is not my life plan,"

04:55.123 --> 04:58.631
and I neveronce doubted myself,

04:58.631 --> 05:00.166
and I was like,
"There's a reason why I'm here."

05:00.166 --> 05:02.706
It was tough.It's
just a crazy world.

05:02.706 --> 05:05.377
'Cause you have to start
looking after yourself,

05:05.377 --> 05:07.481
but this is what you wanted.

05:07.481 --> 05:10.053
This is exactly
the dream that you wanted.

05:10.053 --> 05:12.726
Is that lonely?

05:12.726 --> 05:13.961
Yeah, it's kinda lonely.

05:13.961 --> 05:15.664
I miss my family
so much every day.

05:15.664 --> 05:18.671
And I know what you feel like,

05:18.671 --> 05:20.307
like when you don't
speak to your parents.

05:20.307 --> 05:22.344
You guys inspire me every
day by just even being here.

05:22.344 --> 05:24.583
- <i>Do you know that?</i>
- It's a sacrifice.

05:24.583 --> 05:27.789
It is a sacrifice,

05:27.789 --> 05:29.091
and every day to this day
I sacrifice things.

05:29.091 --> 05:31.128
The higher the risk,
the higher the reward.

05:31.128 --> 05:33.266
Exactly.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.170
<i>I definitely think Rita's
a huge inspiration.</i>

05:35.170 --> 05:37.141
<i>In this competition, a lot
of times we get discouraged,</i>

05:37.141 --> 05:39.345
and Rita let us know
that everything happens
for a reason.

05:39.345 --> 05:42.618
Moving forwardand
when this comes out,

05:42.618 --> 05:45.023
you're gonna
get Twitter feeds.

05:45.023 --> 05:46.426
You're gonna get comments
on Instagram.

05:46.426 --> 05:48.196
Some of you
are gonna be loved.

05:48.196 --> 05:49.933
Some of youare gonna be hated.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.369
And, to be real with you,
I'm scared too

05:51.369 --> 05:54.809
to take over Tyra's shoes,

05:54.809 --> 05:56.714
because this is one
of the biggest

05:56.714 --> 05:58.951
shows ever in history.

05:58.951 --> 06:00.387
And it's okay to be
scared, you know.

06:00.387 --> 06:03.459
It happens to all of us.

06:03.459 --> 06:06.232
Cody:I feel like
out of all of the judges,

06:06.232 --> 06:07.903
<i>Rita is the one that I have
the best connection with.</i>

06:07.903 --> 06:10.674
<i>We both have
that independent mindset.</i>

06:10.674 --> 06:13.714
<i>I moved to New York
by myself,</i>

06:13.714 --> 06:15.784
and I slept
on my friend's couches

06:15.784 --> 06:17.855
and found a job
in two weeks

06:17.855 --> 06:19.626
and I found an apartment
and I sent for my sister
to come.

06:19.626 --> 06:23.132
<i>Can I ask you for advice?</i>

06:23.132 --> 06:25.069
So I feel like
I am super independent.

06:25.069 --> 06:28.243
I've always been the one
that's, like, the jet-setter,

06:28.243 --> 06:29.846
the one who, like,
tries everything first,

06:29.846 --> 06:31.550
and soon
as my sister steps in,

06:31.550 --> 06:33.821
everyone's like,
"She's such a fighter,"

06:33.821 --> 06:35.891
and I'm like,
"No, that's me. That's me.

06:35.891 --> 06:37.260
I'm the fighter. I'm the one
who went to New York by myself

06:37.260 --> 06:39.031
and found us
an apartment."

06:39.031 --> 06:40.902
I'm the one who started
modeling first.

06:40.902 --> 06:42.004
I did this first!
I just never get the credit.

06:42.004 --> 06:44.877
Sometimes I'm just like,

06:44.877 --> 06:46.546
"You don't know
what I've done for you."

06:46.546 --> 06:48.584
Our egos get in the way
and our feelings take over

06:48.584 --> 06:51.856
because it's family.

06:51.856 --> 06:53.927
Maybe you just
have to say thank you.

06:53.927 --> 06:57.735
For what it is that she
thinks that she's done for you.

06:57.735 --> 07:00.273
<i>I hear what she's saying,</i>

07:00.273 --> 07:01.543
but I feel like I could say
the exact same things to her.

07:01.543 --> 07:04.015
Me stepping up
and being a model

07:04.015 --> 07:05.751
is what gets us
the attention that we get.

07:05.751 --> 07:08.356
I deserve a
thank you, too.

07:08.356 --> 07:10.126
How many times
have we talked about this?

07:10.126 --> 07:12.197
It's really annoying.

07:12.197 --> 07:13.901
I've said that,
yes, you are a trailblazer.

07:13.901 --> 07:17.173
I'm very grateful.
I could have never done it.

07:17.173 --> 07:20.615
I've said those things to her.

07:20.615 --> 07:22.117
So for her to bring it up
in front of Rita,

07:22.117 --> 07:24.087
I just feel like she's just,

07:24.087 --> 07:25.591
like, trying to make
me look bad.

07:25.591 --> 07:26.860
You know,
people gravitate towards her

07:26.860 --> 07:28.930
more than they
gravitate towards me.

07:28.930 --> 07:30.300
'Cause I'm friendlier
than you.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.070
...intimidating or something.

07:32.070 --> 07:33.473
During the shoot,
Cody literally turned into me,

07:33.473 --> 07:35.410
and everybody told
hershe was beautiful.

07:35.410 --> 07:37.481
Nobody tells me I'm beautiful.

07:37.481 --> 07:38.382
Why are you both so concerned
about other people's opinion?

07:39.384 --> 07:43.928
You won best photo.

07:43.928 --> 07:45.798
<i>That's true.
Great job.</i>

07:45.798 --> 07:47.300
Why do you need someoneto
tell you, "You look good"?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.402
'Cause they tell the other
girls all the time...

07:48.402 --> 07:49.906
Well, forget that.

07:49.906 --> 07:51.142
You don't need to hear it
from anyone else.

07:51.142 --> 07:53.446
The proof is in the pudding.

07:53.446 --> 07:54.649
Like, anything Cody does,
it's separate.

07:54.649 --> 07:57.087
And I know it must
have hurt you

07:57.087 --> 07:58.156
that you got eliminatedand
that Cody was here.

07:58.156 --> 08:00.728
It must have killed you.

08:00.728 --> 08:02.330
But I don't want you
to see this as revenge.

08:02.330 --> 08:05.170
Please don't do
itlike that, 'cause--

08:05.170 --> 08:07.742
She wants me to do that.
Like...

08:07.742 --> 08:09.411
You're speaking for me,
and that is not what I think.

08:09.411 --> 08:12.852
Okay.

08:12.852 --> 08:14.488
<i>There's six girls
sitting there with Rita Ora,</i>

08:14.488 --> 08:17.829
<i>pop star slash model
slash actress,</i>

08:17.829 --> 08:19.364
and Tash and Cody
make the whole conversation

08:19.364 --> 08:23.005
about themselves.

08:23.005 --> 08:24.174
How self-centered
can you possibly be?

08:24.174 --> 08:27.247
Really?

08:27.247 --> 08:29.853
I love that
we hung out tonight,

08:29.853 --> 08:32.290
but we're also
gonna hang out tomorrow,

08:32.290 --> 08:33.025
and you are all gonna
experience a great day
in my life.

08:34.529 --> 08:38.871
And that's all
I'm gonna tell you.

08:38.871 --> 08:42.679
( laughter )

08:42.679 --> 08:45.450
Have a great night.
Thank you for opening up
with me.

08:45.450 --> 08:49.626
- Thank you.
- Bye.

08:49.626 --> 08:51.830
<i>I'm just excited
that we have tomorrow,</i>

08:51.830 --> 08:53.701
because the twins kinda
used up our entire time

08:53.701 --> 08:56.472
<i>to, like,
get to know Rita.</i>

08:56.472 --> 08:58.844
That was just
really embarrassing.

08:58.844 --> 09:01.115
<i>You could tell she felt
really uncomfortable.</i>

09:01.115 --> 09:03.352
That was supposed to be,
like, about all of us,

09:03.352 --> 09:05.457
and they took
the whole time--

09:05.457 --> 09:06.560
<i>She came to
learn about us,</i>

09:06.560 --> 09:07.895
<i>not hear
their personal problems.</i>

09:07.895 --> 09:10.500
I didn't even
get to say anything,

09:10.500 --> 09:11.803
because Rita was like,
"Okay, I gotta go."

09:11.803 --> 09:13.974
Yeah.

09:13.974 --> 09:15.477
Me and the girls
are kind of tired of the twins

09:15.477 --> 09:19.085
always making everything
about themselves,

09:19.085 --> 09:21.890
<i>and I don't think
that Rita being there</i>

09:21.890 --> 09:25.230
<i>was the right place
to just pour out</i>

09:25.230 --> 09:28.970
any and all
personal issues

09:28.970 --> 09:30.741
that you have
with your sister.

09:30.741 --> 09:31.910
In a way, that wasn't an
advantage that they did that,

09:31.910 --> 09:34.549
because it made them
look bad to Rita.

09:34.549 --> 09:36.051
It didn't come off
as boss-like.

09:39.425 --> 09:44.168
Stop, man.

09:44.168 --> 09:45.771
<i>I worked
so hard for this cause.</i>

09:45.771 --> 09:47.340
<i>This is my time and you
can't take it from me.</i>

09:47.340 --> 09:50.547
You have got to
stopbeing so angry.

09:50.547 --> 09:52.284
Even Rita, she can see
you'rejust an angry little
child.

09:52.284 --> 09:55.290
<i>No, you're just annoying.</i>

09:55.290 --> 09:56.960
<i>You friggin' patronize me,
and I can't stand it.</i>

09:56.960 --> 09:58.630
<i>My relationship with
Cody is so bi-polar</i>

09:58.630 --> 10:00.968
<i>it's ridiculous.</i>

10:00.968 --> 10:01.569
Really have to just
love them through their...

10:02.872 --> 10:06.513
idiocracy.

10:11.957 --> 10:16.933
Today, we're gonna spend
a day in the life of Rita.

10:16.933 --> 10:19.639
I honestly don't know
what that entails.

10:19.639 --> 10:21.543
<i>This day could be
really chill or it could be
crazy.</i>

10:21.543 --> 10:23.479
I just kinda don't know
what to expect.

10:27.087 --> 10:31.663
<i>We pull up to
the first place,</i>

10:31.663 --> 10:33.634
and there's
cameras everywhere.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.573
<i>Tatiana. Tatiana.</i>

10:36.573 --> 10:38.977
<i>There's lights
flashing at us,</i>

10:38.977 --> 10:40.815
<i>and I have no idea
what's going on.</i>

10:40.815 --> 10:42.985
I was like, "Oh, God.
This cannot be good."

10:42.985 --> 10:45.090
The paparazzi,
they're literally everywhere.

10:45.090 --> 10:48.496
Your worst dayncould
be their best day.

10:48.496 --> 10:52.672
Drew:nNo hands,
Tash.NNo pose.

10:52.672 --> 10:54.776
You're not gonna like
any of these pictures.

10:54.776 --> 10:57.849
We're evaluating your body
of work at this point.

10:57.849 --> 10:59.920
I believe that you're
a superstar in pictures.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.024
I haven't seen
it in person.

11:02.024 --> 11:02.524
We're gonna have to
startnseeing that really soon.

11:12.611 --> 11:17.421
<i>So Rita tells us that
we're gonna spend the day</i>

11:17.421 --> 11:20.628
walking in her shoes
and living her life.

11:20.628 --> 11:23.198
We pull up to the hotel,
and we get swarmed by paparazzi.

11:24.669 --> 11:29.445
Tatiana. Tatiana.

11:29.445 --> 11:33.787
I didn't know that
paparazzi could be, like,

11:33.787 --> 11:36.191
so aggressive
and all in your face.

11:36.191 --> 11:38.028
<i>I mean,
I've seen it on TV,</i>

11:38.028 --> 11:39.164
but when it happens to you,
it's different.

11:39.164 --> 11:43.439
- Hi, ladies!
- Hi.

11:43.439 --> 11:46.178
Welcome to the Haven
Rooftop at the Sanctuary Hotel.

11:46.178 --> 11:51.055
How were
the paparazzi downstairs?

11:51.055 --> 11:51.990
Were you guys, like,
"What is going on"?

11:51.990 --> 11:54.395
<i>Surprising.</i>

11:54.395 --> 11:55.664
Well, welcome to the first
step of my life.

11:55.664 --> 11:57.568
They're literally everywhere.

11:57.568 --> 11:59.705
Every timeI step out my door,

11:59.705 --> 12:02.578
it's, like,
a wall of people.

12:02.578 --> 12:04.215
They're more in your face thana
professional fashion shoot.

12:04.215 --> 12:06.886
You girls need to learn
how to be natural

12:06.886 --> 12:09.525
in front of the paparazzi,

12:09.525 --> 12:10.928
so for your
next challenge,

12:10.928 --> 12:12.163
you'll face the paparazzi
again on your way out,

12:12.163 --> 12:14.602
and you'll be evaluated later

12:14.602 --> 12:16.204
on how well
you take my advice.

12:16.204 --> 12:19.077
Celebrities used
to cover their face

12:19.077 --> 12:21.415
and not want to be seen
and hide from all that stuff,

12:21.415 --> 12:24.522
but now we've learned
to embrace the idea

12:24.522 --> 12:27.260
and actually use the
paparazzi as free promotion.

12:27.260 --> 12:29.766
You might as well use themto
help enhance your brand.

12:29.766 --> 12:33.039
But on the flip side,

12:33.039 --> 12:34.608
your worst day
could be their best day.

12:34.608 --> 12:36.847
The key is to be
confident, passionate,
fashionable.

12:36.847 --> 12:40.788
Don't hide your face.

12:40.788 --> 12:41.956
Live your lifelike
you wanna be seen.

12:41.956 --> 12:44.128
It's like accidental modeling.

12:44.128 --> 12:46.967
The celebrity life
is a scary one,

12:46.967 --> 12:48.570
and Rita gave us a taste
of what it's like.

12:48.570 --> 12:51.375
No privacy,
being followed all the time.

12:51.375 --> 12:53.580
It definitely takes
some getting used to.

12:53.580 --> 12:54.783
We've got
a long day ahead of us

12:54.783 --> 12:56.185
of what would happen
in my daily life.

12:56.185 --> 12:58.055
Are you guys ready to start?

12:58.055 --> 12:59.559
- Yes.
- Yeah.

12:59.559 --> 13:00.627
Okay, come with me.

13:00.627 --> 13:01.930
Let's go face those paps.

13:01.930 --> 13:04.536
After Rita
gave us the advice,

13:04.536 --> 13:05.805
<i>now I know
that being a celebrity,</i>

13:05.805 --> 13:08.610
you have to be on
at every moment.

13:08.610 --> 13:13.118
So this time around,
instead of having my hat
forward,

13:13.118 --> 13:16.125
<i>I turned my
hat backwards.</i>

13:16.125 --> 13:17.494
<i>I think I could
definitely get used</i>

13:17.494 --> 13:19.765
to having the outside world
be a photo shoot.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.805
Courtney: <i>I feel like
I'm very confident</i>

13:25.744 --> 13:27.915
<i>at this point
in the competition.</i>

13:27.915 --> 13:29.952
<i>I would love to be at a
levelof being followed by
paparazzi.</i>

13:29.952 --> 13:33.425
This is why I'm here.
I'm hungry for this.

13:41.576 --> 13:46.018
So how's the day in the life
of Rita Ora been today?

13:46.018 --> 13:48.657
- Good.
- Glamorous.

13:48.657 --> 13:50.861
Well, we are just
getting started.

13:50.861 --> 13:52.931
As a part of living
the life as Rita Ora,

13:52.931 --> 13:55.537
we are going to shoot
a "Paper" magazine cover.

13:55.537 --> 13:59.579
And this is actually the
place we shot my "Paper" cover.

13:59.579 --> 14:03.453
This is where we're gonna
really separate the girls
from the models,

14:03.453 --> 14:07.027
because only a superstar
gets the cover of "Paper."

14:07.027 --> 14:11.101
And the winner of
"America's Next Top Model,"

14:11.101 --> 14:13.506
this cover will be published
and viewed by the world

14:13.506 --> 14:16.613
on PaperMag.com.

14:16.613 --> 14:18.482
<i>What?</i>

14:18.482 --> 14:19.852
<i>I am so excited.</i>

14:19.852 --> 14:22.223
Being on the cover
of a magazine

14:22.223 --> 14:23.961
is that "I've made it"
moment for everyone,

14:23.961 --> 14:26.398
<i>so there's
a lot of pressure.</i>

14:26.398 --> 14:28.469
Okay, we got a lot to do,

14:28.469 --> 14:29.839
so let's go and get glam!

14:34.214 --> 14:38.222
I wore something similar
to this for my photo,
remember?

14:38.222 --> 14:41.395
Where I was crawling
on the table.

14:41.395 --> 14:43.132
I love playing dress up.
It's my favorite thing
in the world.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.706
Drew:
When you are on the cover
of a magazine,

14:46.706 --> 14:49.646
<i>you are
selling you.</i>

14:49.646 --> 14:51.182
It's not about
the clothes.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.885
It's not about
the stylist.

14:52.885 --> 14:54.421
<i>It's about your project</i>

14:54.421 --> 14:55.724
<i>or whatever it is
that you're doing.</i>

14:55.724 --> 14:57.226
So I'm really, really excited.

14:57.226 --> 14:58.997
Can we not just
crop her like that?

14:58.997 --> 15:00.266
So it's just, like,
the shoulders and her face

15:00.266 --> 15:03.206
and not even that much makeup.

15:03.206 --> 15:04.408
And then just make it
about the eyebrows and the eyes.

15:04.408 --> 15:07.681
Like, just, pretty.

15:07.681 --> 15:08.917
<i>I'm all for jewelry, like,
overdoing everything.</i>

15:08.917 --> 15:12.156
I'm liking
where this is going.

15:12.156 --> 15:14.729
Maybe I can get a job
at "Paper" with you guys.

15:14.729 --> 15:15.931
Okay, ladies, can I
steal you for a minute?

15:17.902 --> 15:21.509
Come on out here.

15:21.509 --> 15:23.847
Today you guys experienced
what it's like

15:23.847 --> 15:25.250
to be followed
by the paparazzi,

15:25.250 --> 15:26.886
and I gave you
some great tips.

15:26.886 --> 15:28.890
We're basing the challenge

15:28.890 --> 15:30.293
on if you took my advice
on board.

15:30.293 --> 15:33.800
So let's take a look.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.571
<i>From when you walked in
to not having a clue, Cody,</i>

15:35.571 --> 15:39.111
it really made me happy
that you showed your face,

15:39.111 --> 15:42.350
<i>'cause in the first one,</i>

15:42.350 --> 15:43.554
<i>you were
completely covered.</i>

15:43.554 --> 15:45.456
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:45.456 --> 15:46.693
And you took on my advice,
which was very great.

15:46.693 --> 15:50.299
This, for me, Coryanne,

15:50.299 --> 15:52.270
<i>out of all the photos
that I saw,</i>

15:52.270 --> 15:54.274
<i>you were giving
the most face.</i>

15:54.274 --> 15:55.544
<i>Like, your face
was always perfect.</i>

15:55.544 --> 15:57.648
So the next one...

15:57.648 --> 15:59.284
Drew:This pose is amazing.

15:59.284 --> 16:01.088
It just shows
you effortless.

16:01.088 --> 16:02.825
Like,
"Oh, this is who I am."

16:02.825 --> 16:03.927
<i>- India.
- Oh, God.</i>

16:03.927 --> 16:06.164
( laughter )

16:06.164 --> 16:07.067
The one thing
that people love to see

16:07.067 --> 16:09.471
is how you really are.

16:09.471 --> 16:11.308
<i>This showed
a lot of personality.</i>

16:11.308 --> 16:13.747
India: All the pictures
are very modelesque,

16:13.747 --> 16:15.551
<i>but my photo
was a little bit different.</i>

16:15.551 --> 16:17.921
I kind of liked that,

16:17.921 --> 16:19.324
because I was the only one
who showed my personality.

16:19.324 --> 16:21.996
<i>So I think I
really killed it.</i>

16:21.996 --> 16:23.098
<i>- The next one.
- This pose is amazing
of you, Courtney.</i>

16:23.098 --> 16:25.469
You capture that attention,

16:25.469 --> 16:28.342
and you look mischievous,

16:28.342 --> 16:31.114
which I think is
really,really interesting.

16:31.114 --> 16:32.016
As in we don't know whose
hotel room you just came out of.

16:32.016 --> 16:33.520
Exactly.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.089
Oh.

16:35.089 --> 16:36.793
So let's see.
The next one.

16:36.793 --> 16:38.630
<i>This, for me,
was really great.</i>

16:38.630 --> 16:40.032
You just looked like you signed
a million dollar deal like that.

16:40.032 --> 16:43.940
Billion.

16:43.940 --> 16:45.276
And I was like, "Who does she
have a meeting with?"

16:45.276 --> 16:48.349
Drew:Yeah.

16:48.349 --> 16:50.086
I can tell in your persona
that you're meant to be there.

16:50.086 --> 16:52.691
So the winner of this
paparazzi challenge is...

16:53.794 --> 16:58.002
Courtney.

16:58.002 --> 17:00.206
Drew:Congratulations.

17:00.206 --> 17:01.876
Thank you.

17:01.876 --> 17:02.545
I want you
to pick a friend.

17:02.545 --> 17:05.382
India.

17:05.382 --> 17:07.320
Tomorrow, you guys are gonna
head out of town in the morning

17:07.320 --> 17:09.223
on a VIP adventure
to Universal Orlando Resort.

17:10.459 --> 17:14.902
Oh, my God.

17:14.902 --> 17:16.205
It's an entertainment
destination.

17:16.205 --> 17:18.208
Rita:And you guysget
to live it up

17:18.208 --> 17:20.379
at the Loews Portofino
Bay Hotel.

17:20.379 --> 17:22.016
You guys are gonna
go have a blast and have
a day off in Florida.

17:22.016 --> 17:25.890
Oh, my God.
We get to go to Universal!

17:25.890 --> 17:28.830
I am so excited,

17:28.830 --> 17:29.999
because I've never been
to Universal Studios.

17:29.999 --> 17:33.005
Feels pretty good
right now.

17:33.005 --> 17:34.742
Rita:Thank you guys for
spendingthe day with me,

17:34.742 --> 17:36.311
and have an amazing
rest of your shoot.

17:36.311 --> 17:38.215
Thank you so much.

17:38.215 --> 17:39.852
See you later.

17:39.852 --> 17:40.921
Courtney ends up
picking India,

17:40.921 --> 17:42.925
which is
a very smart decision,

17:42.925 --> 17:44.261
<i>because India
is the only one</i>

17:44.261 --> 17:46.665
<i>who can at least
pretend to enjoy</i>

17:46.665 --> 17:48.068
a stay in a resort
with Courtney.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.974
We're going on vacation.

17:50.974 --> 17:53.078
I'm so excited.

17:53.078 --> 17:54.716
- I love amusement parks.
- Me too!

17:54.716 --> 17:56.418
- So much.
- We're gonna have a blast.

17:56.418 --> 17:59.191
So should
we make a cover?

17:59.191 --> 18:00.527
Yeah. Honey,
if we can't make a cover,

18:00.527 --> 18:02.063
I don't know who can.

18:02.063 --> 18:03.667
All right, let's get Tash.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.103
<i>I'm first up
in this photo shoot,</i>

18:05.103 --> 18:07.440
and I feel
super confident.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.444
<i>I really need to prove</i>

18:09.444 --> 18:11.015
<i>that although Cody believes
she's better than me,</i>

18:11.015 --> 18:14.387
I can stand next to her
and I can really

18:14.387 --> 18:16.926
be a contender
in this competition.

18:16.926 --> 18:19.130
- It's your cover moment.
- Okay.

18:19.130 --> 18:20.967
It's gonna be about
everything from here up.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.573
And sometimes
we crop it like this.

18:23.573 --> 18:27.080
It's really
about the face.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.183
And the other thing
that is critical in the cover

18:29.183 --> 18:31.388
is you have to make
eye contact with the camera.

18:31.388 --> 18:34.929
All right, here we go.

18:34.929 --> 18:36.799
So at first
I have this whole idea

18:36.799 --> 18:40.240
behind what I
was gonna do.

18:40.240 --> 18:43.813
<i>I saw the set.
I felt like a cloud,</i>

18:43.813 --> 18:46.418
<i>like I was floating,</i>

18:46.418 --> 18:48.055
<i>and I just--
I had this idea</i>

18:48.055 --> 18:49.559
of this angel coming down
to save the children.

18:49.559 --> 18:52.229
Did you feel like it's
a bittheatrical maybe?

18:52.229 --> 18:55.002
Yeah.
It's so theatrical.

18:55.002 --> 18:57.140
I wanna try to push it
more in, like,

18:57.140 --> 18:58.644
a fashion, like--
and remember you're still
a model at the end of the day

18:58.644 --> 19:01.582
and get some more dynamic
poses out of it.

19:01.582 --> 19:04.454
No hands, Tash. Stronger.

19:04.454 --> 19:07.426
No pose.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.305
Tash, the thing is
is that you're not gonna
like any of these pictures.

19:13.305 --> 19:18.115
It's gotta
be about your face.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.086
Right now you're
looking really old.

19:20.086 --> 19:21.354
We don't have a cover yet.
I'm gonna tell you that, okay?

19:37.621 --> 19:40.661
Tash, the thing is that
you're not going to like

19:40.661 --> 19:42.765
any of these pictures.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.267
Tash came onto the set
and it was a bomb.

19:44.267 --> 19:48.008
<i>She wanted to be a cloud,
and I'm, like,</i>

19:48.008 --> 19:49.612
"Have you ever seen anyone
doing this in a cover?"

19:49.612 --> 19:53.152
<i>It was weird.</i>

19:53.152 --> 19:54.856
You're like this...

19:54.856 --> 19:56.560
As a cover star, you
want me to crop this.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.899
Straight to my face.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.903
And so you have to
give me a face

20:01.903 --> 20:03.674
- Right.
- And, like, I'm getting this.

20:03.674 --> 20:05.610
- You're not a magician.
- <i>I got it.</i>

20:05.610 --> 20:09.952
No pose.
Like, people are getting
to know you.

20:09.952 --> 20:11.989
Just rela-- like,
shake it out for a second

20:11.989 --> 20:14.294
because this is not you
as a character.

20:14.294 --> 20:17.734
It's you.
Own it.

20:17.734 --> 20:21.642
So I hear that nothing
that I have is good.

20:21.642 --> 20:24.014
The old me would have
freaked out at hearing
this news,

20:24.014 --> 20:27.186
but the new me is,
"It's not over.

20:27.186 --> 20:29.424
Listen and take action."

20:29.424 --> 20:32.396
That's it.

20:32.396 --> 20:34.067
This is what
I'm talking about.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.038
These are much better.

20:36.038 --> 20:38.375
All right.

20:38.375 --> 20:39.645
- Nice. Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

20:39.645 --> 20:41.181
Okay, who do we have next?
Cody?

20:41.181 --> 20:42.483
Cody:I'm just so excited
that this cover shoot

20:42.483 --> 20:47.160
I just get to be myself.

20:47.160 --> 20:50.032
That is when
I'm the most confident
is when I'm being me.

20:50.032 --> 20:51.669
<i>I just can't wait
to show them what I got.</i>

20:51.669 --> 20:54.174
Oh. It looks like
from a different era.

20:54.174 --> 20:56.078
Mm-hmm. Let's do a hundred
more shots like this.

20:56.078 --> 20:58.516
Give us some variation,
but keep doing this.

20:58.516 --> 21:02.758
Yes. Yes. Yes.

21:02.758 --> 21:06.031
Don't. Mess. With. Me.

21:06.031 --> 21:09.738
Cody nailed it
in the first frame.

21:09.738 --> 21:13.680
<i>She just had the
confidence of a mega star.</i>

21:13.680 --> 21:16.050
And that's what makes
a magazine cover.

21:16.050 --> 21:18.857
- This is fabulous.
- Fabulous.

21:18.857 --> 21:22.898
She is re--eh--eh--eh--eady.

21:22.898 --> 21:26.705
Coryanne: I think
I had the most coveresque
look really.

21:26.705 --> 21:28.408
I don't know, I just had,
like, the wow factor of the day.

21:29.477 --> 21:33.886
Don't do weird hands.

21:33.886 --> 21:36.792
It's gotta be about your face.

21:36.792 --> 21:40.066
Right now,
you're looking really old.

21:40.066 --> 21:43.706
You gotta soften it up.

21:43.706 --> 21:44.975
<i>Coryanne, she looks like
an elderly woman.</i>

21:44.975 --> 21:48.917
Scrunching her face
didn't do her any favors.

21:48.917 --> 21:51.823
Profiles don't sell
magazines, darling.

21:51.823 --> 21:54.328
Maybe some bigger eyes
will make it look younger.

21:54.328 --> 21:56.498
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

21:56.498 --> 21:57.399
That's good.
These are better.

21:57.399 --> 22:00.641
That's great.

22:00.641 --> 22:03.245
I bet that looks fab.
Does that look fab?

22:03.245 --> 22:05.282
Yeah, that looks great.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.685
This is a photo shoot that
whoever wins this competition

22:06.685 --> 22:08.923
is going to go out
to the world.

22:08.923 --> 22:10.527
<i>The pressure
is on for sure.</i>

22:10.527 --> 22:11.862
So do what you want.
Don't be a model.

22:11.862 --> 22:13.933
This is about you.
This is winning.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.639
This is big.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.810
We don't have a cover yet.

22:18.810 --> 22:20.948
I'm gonna tell you that,
okay?

22:20.948 --> 22:22.751
Tatiana: I'm honestly not
feeling 100% confident
right now,

22:22.751 --> 22:24.856
but, I mean, I'm just
hoping that by the end of this,

22:24.856 --> 22:27.326
<i>I get an amazing shot.</i>

22:27.326 --> 22:29.765
Think cover and, like,
where people would have
their hands.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.504
Be aware of, like,
that they're there

22:32.504 --> 22:34.976
and making shapes too.

22:34.976 --> 22:37.046
- This is better.
- That is.

22:37.046 --> 22:39.283
That's good.

22:39.283 --> 22:41.956
That's fabulous.

22:41.956 --> 22:42.691
Now, India, imagine this is
your introduction to the world.

22:44.294 --> 22:48.870
That's great.
Gorgeous.

22:48.870 --> 22:51.275
Drew:India, she knows what
she's doing

22:51.275 --> 22:54.815
and she's got this.

22:54.815 --> 22:56.619
The thing that's going
to be a make or break for her

22:56.619 --> 23:00.960
<i>is does she shine
as a personality?</i>

23:00.960 --> 23:04.635
Let's just try some where we
kind of, like, let loose.

23:04.635 --> 23:07.340
India:Last panel I was
told just to be a little bit
more aware

23:07.340 --> 23:10.479
of my body movements,

23:10.479 --> 23:11.481
<i>so I tried to pose
as flattering as possible.</i>

23:11.481 --> 23:14.186
Great. We got it.

23:14.186 --> 23:16.759
You can deliver
a great face,

23:16.759 --> 23:18.495
so let's deliver
a great face, all right?

23:18.495 --> 23:20.934
I'm excited.

23:20.934 --> 23:22.203
Just bear in mind
it's a beauty shot, okay.

23:22.203 --> 23:24.842
Courtney:My forte.

23:24.842 --> 23:26.979
Let's hope.

23:26.979 --> 23:29.250
For the shoot,
I feel pretty confident.

23:29.250 --> 23:30.386
<i>Beauty work is the one
thing that I will get booked fr
consistently.</i>

23:30.386 --> 23:33.491
Don't cover your face.

23:34.995 --> 23:36.532
Don't touch your face.
Don't play with your face.

23:39.337 --> 23:42.109
Flat on, Courtney.

23:42.109 --> 23:43.680
Cody: <i>Courtney hasthe
same facefor every photo.</i>

23:43.680 --> 23:46.719
She does not know
how to have variation,

23:46.719 --> 23:49.257
so I'm sure she just gave
that same, like...

23:49.257 --> 23:50.025
I wish there were some where
she's a little more relaxed.

23:54.067 --> 23:55.937
So, Courtney,
give us some relaxed
so that we have some options.

23:55.937 --> 23:59.545
<i>No weird arm things.
Just make it pretty.</i>

23:59.545 --> 24:01.080
I think Courtney, she
tries to bring strength into it,

24:02.517 --> 24:07.093
that it doesn't
necessarily need.

24:07.093 --> 24:10.132
<i>Not too high on the chin.</i>

24:10.132 --> 24:12.202
<i>Remember, keeping
the eye focus is critical.</i>

24:12.202 --> 24:14.742
I think I did really well
in comparison to a couple
of the girls.

24:14.742 --> 24:18.048
It was awesome to produce
areally good cover for "Paper."

24:18.048 --> 24:21.823
That's a wrap.

24:21.823 --> 24:23.893
Yay.

24:32.243 --> 24:37.052
Oh, my God.
Such a mess.

24:37.052 --> 24:38.589
I get to go to Universal
Studios Orlando with Courtney.

24:40.226 --> 24:45.068
( imitates explosion )
What?

24:45.068 --> 24:46.471
<i>I'm not surprised
that Courtney picked me</i>

24:46.471 --> 24:47.807
<i>because we've gotten
close recently,</i>

24:47.807 --> 24:49.410
and I like that she
can turn to me for advice

24:49.410 --> 24:52.651
or if she needs to talk
about anything,

24:52.651 --> 24:54.453
I like being that one
person in the house

24:54.453 --> 24:55.823
that she can do that with
because she gets some crap
in the house.

24:55.823 --> 24:58.629
She really does.

24:58.629 --> 24:59.599
Literally gonna be
screaming and jumping up and
down

24:59.599 --> 25:02.671
like a small child.

25:02.671 --> 25:03.807
Things happen for a
reason, like, I feel like that
was

25:03.807 --> 25:04.975
a challenge for Courtney
to win, you know?

25:06.110 --> 25:08.081
I know.

25:12.958 --> 25:17.132
Courtney being gone is
kinda like a win for everyone.

25:17.132 --> 25:20.105
I mean, a lot of the
people in the competition

25:20.105 --> 25:22.443
<i>besides India
have tension with Courtney,</i>

25:22.443 --> 25:25.116
<i>so her being away
for the day,</i>

25:25.116 --> 25:27.019
I feel like she's on a
little day vacation and so am I.

25:27.019 --> 25:28.455
Good night, Courtney.
I got the alarm set for 4:00.

25:28.455 --> 25:32.229
<i>Whoo!</i>

25:32.229 --> 25:33.833
Sometimes on set, you were
very unsure of yourself,

25:33.833 --> 25:36.939
<i>so I need you
to take it to the end.</i>

25:36.939 --> 25:37.941
or we're gonna let someone
else take it from you.

25:50.701 --> 25:53.673
So I'm really excited.
We're here in Orlando,

25:53.673 --> 25:55.510
<i>and were going
to Universal Studios.</i>

26:04.528 --> 26:09.103
- Welcome to Hogwart's.
- ( laughing )

26:09.103 --> 26:11.341
We're at the Wizarding
World of Harry Potter

26:11.341 --> 26:13.646
and I am so excited

26:13.646 --> 26:14.681
<i>because I'm a huge fan
of "Harry Potter."</i>

26:22.396 --> 26:26.371
- Here we go.
- Right here.

26:26.371 --> 26:29.177
Okay.

26:29.177 --> 26:31.582
Oh, it's Hagrid.
"Pull down on your lap bars."

26:31.582 --> 26:34.855
- Hagrid.
- Whoo!

26:34.855 --> 26:38.796
Seeing Courtney in her
element was really cool.

26:38.796 --> 26:41.769
<i>She is a big
kid at heart.</i>

26:41.769 --> 26:44.406
<i>There is no better person
to win this challenge
than Courtney</i>

26:44.406 --> 26:47.280
because she loves
all the movies,

26:47.280 --> 26:48.381
she loves
all the characters.

26:48.381 --> 26:49.618
Oh, my gosh.
Look at this.

26:49.618 --> 26:52.356
Look at the chimneys.
This is so cool.

26:52.356 --> 26:55.530
It's a shame that
the other girls don't get to see
that side of her.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.066
Honeyduke's.
Whoo!

26:57.066 --> 27:00.540
Wow.

27:00.540 --> 27:02.877
This is candy heaven.

27:02.877 --> 27:05.049
Exploding Bon Bons.
That's from the movie.

27:05.049 --> 27:08.389
- Stock up, stock up.
- Oh, I'm stocking up.

27:08.389 --> 27:11.094
India was definitely
the best person
to go on this trip with

27:11.094 --> 27:13.666
<i>because I got to run
around like a little kid with
her.</i>

27:13.666 --> 27:15.570
<i>and not be embarrassed
about getting excited</i>

27:15.570 --> 27:18.274
over things like butterbeer.

27:18.274 --> 27:19.812
I don't want actual beer.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.616
I want butterbeer.
Oh, my God. Butterbeer.

27:21.616 --> 27:25.757
Thank you. All right,
are you ready for this?

27:25.757 --> 27:28.630
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

27:28.630 --> 27:30.132
You know, I chose India
because she's been
extremely sweet to me

27:30.132 --> 27:33.773
and none of the other
girls in the house really have.

27:33.773 --> 27:35.677
Karma is karma because if
you're nice to people,

27:35.677 --> 27:39.316
then nice things happen
to you.

27:39.316 --> 27:40.485
Let's think.
How many girls are left?

27:40.485 --> 27:42.524
- Six. Six.
- Seven.

27:42.524 --> 27:44.126
- Six? ( bleep )
- Six.

27:44.126 --> 27:46.464
- Tomorrow--
- That's how quickly it's going.

27:46.464 --> 27:48.970
This week,
there's gonna be five.

27:48.970 --> 27:50.339
<i>It's crunch time and it's all
about how you perform.</i>

27:50.339 --> 27:52.944
- That's what's so crazy.
- I'm excited.

27:52.944 --> 27:54.614
I think the judges are
finally starting to like me

27:54.614 --> 27:56.585
and see a lot of potential
in me. That's cool.

27:56.585 --> 27:58.421
Yeah, no, definitely.

27:58.421 --> 27:59.625
I mean, it's not like
the disliked me before,

27:59.625 --> 28:01.261
but I was just kinda like,
"Hi, I'm here."

28:01.261 --> 28:02.964
It's hard to get any
attentionwhen there's 14 of us.

28:02.964 --> 28:05.335
Who do you thinkis
gonna go home?

28:05.335 --> 28:07.039
I think Tatiana.

28:07.039 --> 28:08.609
<i>They said
that she was coasting.</i>

28:08.609 --> 28:10.312
- Yeah.
- And then the past two shoots,

28:10.312 --> 28:11.949
she's been, like, blah.

28:14.788 --> 28:19.496
Courtney, like,at one moment,

28:19.496 --> 28:21.636
she acts like
she's gonna change

28:21.636 --> 28:23.238
and then all of a sudden,
she just flips.

28:23.238 --> 28:25.209
and she just goes back
to being her victim self.

28:25.209 --> 28:28.214
I wonder
if they had any tiffs.

28:28.214 --> 28:30.687
- <i>I don't think so.</i>
- I doubt it.

28:30.687 --> 28:31.622
India is the type
of person that, like...

28:31.622 --> 28:36.197
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

28:36.197 --> 28:37.867
I'm happy that we kinda
just all get a day away from
Courtney.

28:37.867 --> 28:40.874
<i>I'm excited to be able
to relax.</i>

28:40.874 --> 28:41.542
She's going up
to the panel, like...

28:41.542 --> 28:43.579
"Hey, guys."

28:43.579 --> 28:45.082
Oh, my gosh, like,
you're so funny.

28:45.082 --> 28:48.021
Like, you're, like,
hilarious.

28:48.021 --> 28:49.925
See, what's so funny is at
home, I was always considered
the mean twin.

28:49.925 --> 28:51.595
Like, I-- like, my mom,
Tash, everybody would say I'm
the mean one.

28:51.595 --> 28:55.402
So when I get around
other people,

28:55.402 --> 28:56.906
and they think I'm nice,
I live for it.

28:56.906 --> 28:58.843
And I'm like,
"She's the mean one, you guys."

28:58.843 --> 29:00.178
And I try to push that
on her.

29:00.178 --> 29:01.682
Stop, see, like,
shut the ( bleep ) up.

29:01.682 --> 29:04.521
- Like, shush.
- Stop right there.

29:04.521 --> 29:06.390
I get that it's a twin
thing, but y'all need to make
that disconnect.

29:06.390 --> 29:08.863
You thinking that you're nice,

29:08.863 --> 29:09.765
you don't even have to say
nothing about her.

29:09.765 --> 29:11.902
I am so aware of that,

29:11.902 --> 29:13.071
<i>but for so long it just
hurt me that, like--</i>

29:13.071 --> 29:16.210
You want to--you
had that resentment.

29:16.210 --> 29:17.748
I have--
I have that resentment.

29:17.748 --> 29:19.518
I feel like I've always
been super independent.

29:19.518 --> 29:21.789
<i>And being an identical twin,
it's something that has been</i>

29:21.789 --> 29:25.228
a little bit of a gift
and a curse.

29:25.228 --> 29:27.399
You're always gonna
beconsciously thinking

29:27.399 --> 29:28.569
before you even
sayanything out loud.

29:28.569 --> 29:29.704
You're always gonna be
thinking about

29:29.704 --> 29:30.907
what someone else
is thinking about.

29:30.907 --> 29:32.543
And in order to grow,
you can't have that.

29:32.543 --> 29:34.247
- Yeah.
- You have to be able
to just be free.

29:34.247 --> 29:35.917
I love the twins,but I
feel like they just have

29:35.917 --> 29:39.089
so many unresolved
and underlying issues

29:39.089 --> 29:42.262
that they need to get out
and that they need to solve

29:42.262 --> 29:44.467
if they want to move forward
because at the end of the day,

29:44.467 --> 29:46.972
<i>it is a competition
and one person has to win.</i>

29:46.972 --> 29:49.611
I've always wanted a third
person to sit in on, like, us

29:49.611 --> 29:51.715
'cause I feel like
we talking to each other,

29:51.715 --> 29:52.750
it just--
it's not getting nowhere.

29:56.490 --> 30:01.267
- What?
- Holy crap.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.940
Courtney:
<i>So we get to the hotel
and we walk in.</i>

30:03.940 --> 30:06.211
I just--
I couldn't believe it.

30:06.211 --> 30:08.081
Holy crap.

30:08.081 --> 30:10.119
On the beds
are two wizard's cloaks.

30:10.119 --> 30:12.824
India, I'm begging you
to walk into the house

30:12.824 --> 30:16.164
- like this with me
tomorrow. - Yes.

30:16.164 --> 30:18.068
I'm super happy
that I've had this experience

30:18.068 --> 30:19.972
<i>and I'm ready to get
back into the competition.</i>

30:19.972 --> 30:22.911
We almost didn't think
about anything today.

30:22.911 --> 30:24.313
It was literally just let's have
fun at this theme park
and enjoy each other's company.

30:24.313 --> 30:26.751
- Yeah.
- We owe a big thank--

30:26.751 --> 30:27.787
For the first time ever,
I'm going to walk into panel,

30:27.787 --> 30:30.125
like, with a fat smile
on my face.

30:44.119 --> 30:49.096
Hello, ladies.

30:49.096 --> 30:51.034
So this week, I got a
chance to spend some quality
time with you

30:51.034 --> 30:53.940
and show you what it's like
to live my fast-paced life.

30:53.940 --> 30:58.214
From being followed
by tons of paparazzi

30:58.214 --> 30:59.818
to shooting the coverof
a major magazine.

30:59.818 --> 31:03.124
Appearing on the cover
of a magazine like "Paper"

31:03.124 --> 31:06.063
can be a career-changingmoment.

31:06.063 --> 31:08.501
You all got the chance to
seewhat that could be like.

31:08.501 --> 31:11.542
You all posed
for a "Paper" cover try.

31:11.542 --> 31:13.713
For whoever wins"America's
Next Top Model,"

31:13.713 --> 31:15.850
their cover will be
viewedby the world

31:15.850 --> 31:18.722
on PaperMag.com.

31:18.722 --> 31:20.960
Now, let's say hello
to our amazing judges.

31:20.960 --> 31:23.497
Gorgeous supermodel
and body activist,
Ashley Graham.

31:23.497 --> 31:27.673
And our amazing image
architect to the stars, Law
Roach.

31:27.673 --> 31:30.646
Creative consultant
and Chief Creative Officer
at "Paper" magazine,

31:30.646 --> 31:34.588
Drew Elliott.

31:34.588 --> 31:36.257
The winner of "Next Top
Model"will receive $100,000,

31:36.257 --> 31:39.931
and be featured in a
commercialthanks to Rimmel
London.

31:39.931 --> 31:43.005
In addition, the winner
will also be featured

31:43.005 --> 31:46.177
in a fashion spreadfor
"Paper" magazine.

31:46.177 --> 31:47.145
<i>and get an exclusiveone
year talent dealwith VH-1.</i>

31:48.215 --> 31:52.857
First up, Courtney.

31:52.857 --> 31:55.730
Let's take a look
at your cover try.

31:55.730 --> 31:56.932
This is an amazing photo
because you listened
to what I said

31:56.932 --> 32:01.575
about it just being a
beauty kind of shot for you,

32:01.575 --> 32:03.779
and it really showing
offyour strong features.

32:03.779 --> 32:06.685
What this looks like
is pure, easy perfection.

32:06.685 --> 32:10.192
All I see is the eyebrows
and the cheekbones,

32:10.192 --> 32:11.962
<i>and I think
"high-end fashion."</i>

32:11.962 --> 32:13.297
I think that you nailed this,

32:13.297 --> 32:15.068
but getting therewas very hard

32:15.068 --> 32:17.541
because you
couldn'tfind your light,

32:17.541 --> 32:18.609
and all the things
that were grayed out

32:18.609 --> 32:21.214
when we're very far away
from you

32:21.214 --> 32:22.717
really became
nerve-racking as it got closer
in your face.

32:22.717 --> 32:26.892
We're evaluating
your body of work at this point.

32:26.892 --> 32:29.363
It's not just what
we seein front of us.

32:29.363 --> 32:30.800
That's all of you girls,
by the way.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.573
Up next, Coryanne.

32:33.573 --> 32:36.745
This is the most attitude
I've ever seen of you.

32:36.745 --> 32:40.987
That's what I
alwaysnthought was missing.

32:40.987 --> 32:42.657
I think she's great,
and I love the attitude,
the arc of the eyebrow.

32:42.657 --> 32:47.166
For me, this is onenof your
best shots, hands down.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.236
This isn't for me at all.
It's very Tim Burton.

32:49.236 --> 32:52.710
<i>It looks a
little spooky.</i>

32:52.710 --> 32:54.380
When we were on set, I'm
like, "You look really old."

32:54.380 --> 32:56.552
But that's the hair
and makeup's fault.

32:56.552 --> 32:58.154
It's not the hair
and makeup's fault

32:58.154 --> 32:59.123
because I saw her
when she wasn't being shot,

32:59.123 --> 33:01.996
and she looked very cool.

33:01.996 --> 33:02.797
But I will say I did see
something in you
that was elevated

33:04.400 --> 33:09.143
from where I had
remembered you before.

33:09.143 --> 33:11.313
Thank you very much,
Coryanne.

33:11.313 --> 33:14.186
Up next, Cody.

33:14.186 --> 33:17.761
- How are you?
- I'm great.

33:17.761 --> 33:19.664
Coming over to the house,
it was a very eventful evening.

33:19.664 --> 33:23.271
And I kind of got to know
there's a situation at hand

33:23.271 --> 33:26.077
going on with your sister,
so how are you feeling?

33:26.077 --> 33:29.517
I'm--
I'm really, really good.

33:29.517 --> 33:31.688
I think a lot of the
things that you said

33:31.688 --> 33:33.358
<i>really put things
into perspective for me.</i>

33:33.358 --> 33:35.663
Just hearing your
pointof view was like,

33:35.663 --> 33:37.299
"Okay, this is possible.
We can fix this."

33:37.299 --> 33:38.367
With that said, I'd love
to see what your cover try looks
like.

33:40.338 --> 33:44.882
<i>Excuse me, Cody-lee.
Can we have a moment?</i>

33:44.882 --> 33:48.054
I mean, that's what
I'm talking about.

33:48.054 --> 33:51.895
From now on,
this is the bar.

33:51.895 --> 33:53.966
Ashley: <i>Like,nthat's
makeup campaign beauty.</i>

33:53.966 --> 33:56.572
What makes even more
interesting is that it's cropped

33:56.572 --> 33:59.009
from a little bit
above the chest.

33:59.009 --> 34:00.879
<i>It's not just face.</i>

34:00.879 --> 34:02.884
It's you're getting the
hair. You're getting the
emotion.

34:02.884 --> 34:04.387
I'm loving what's going on
behind you because it's bringing
everything out.

34:04.387 --> 34:05.890
- The hair is working.
- I mean, it's just like,

34:05.890 --> 34:08.061
- "Damn, Cody-lee."
- Right?

34:08.061 --> 34:10.065
( grunting )

34:10.065 --> 34:12.336
Thank you, Cody.
Up next, Tash.

34:12.336 --> 34:15.843
<i>This, for me,
looks like a photo</i>

34:15.843 --> 34:19.918
that somebody took
at an after party

34:19.918 --> 34:21.254
and had to make a leaflet
in, like, five minutes.

34:21.254 --> 34:24.260
I disagree with Rita.

34:24.260 --> 34:25.228
I think it's
a beautiful picture.

34:25.228 --> 34:27.032
I think you look soft.

34:27.032 --> 34:28.234
I don't know
if it's "Paper" magazine.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.239
Maybe "National Geographic."

34:30.239 --> 34:31.206
For "National Geographic"
though, really?

34:31.206 --> 34:34.915
I'll take it.

34:34.915 --> 34:36.718
Last week, you were amazing.

34:36.718 --> 34:38.655
I don't need a modelwho
is going to deliver

34:38.655 --> 34:42.831
one weekand not the next week

34:42.831 --> 34:45.569
in such polar opposites.

34:45.569 --> 34:47.373
Compared to last week
of you being strong,

34:47.373 --> 34:48.943
<i>do you think this is
the same standard?</i>

34:48.943 --> 34:51.247
I do.
I think that's me.

34:51.247 --> 34:53.451
When I came into
this competition,

34:53.451 --> 34:55.188
I was-- I said that, you know,
I was girly and I was flirty

34:55.188 --> 34:57.793
and, you know,
I wanted to be soft

34:57.793 --> 34:59.229
and that's something that I
really wanted to show the world

34:59.229 --> 35:00.866
that even though I have
this hair,

35:00.866 --> 35:02.369
<i>even though I have
this angular face,</i>

35:02.369 --> 35:04.339
<i>that I can be
the girl next door.</i>

35:04.339 --> 35:05.676
I completely understand
what you were trying to achieve,

35:05.676 --> 35:08.949
but it just didn't work.

35:08.949 --> 35:10.620
There's a method to
figuring out what your natural
is in the camera.

35:10.620 --> 35:15.128
Like, I had to figure out
how to not model.

35:15.128 --> 35:16.765
I was the girl,
the catalog queen,

35:16.765 --> 35:18.101
"Hey, ha,"
flipping the hair, yeah.

35:18.101 --> 35:20.204
[chuckles]

35:20.204 --> 35:21.641
I had to figure out
how to just stand there.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.077
And there is a method
to the madness of standing there

35:23.077 --> 35:26.117
and just giving face.

35:26.117 --> 35:28.154
I believe that's you,

35:28.154 --> 35:29.490
but I believe
there's a better you.

35:29.490 --> 35:30.492
- Okay.
- Up next, India.

35:30.492 --> 35:33.566
- Hello.
- Hi, India.

35:33.566 --> 35:35.334
You look great today.
I like your legs.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.206
You looking really like
you're getting to know yourself.

35:37.206 --> 35:39.544
Thank you.
I like to hear it.

35:39.544 --> 35:41.247
Well, India,
let's have a look.

35:41.247 --> 35:44.220
This is amazing!
It's gorgeous!

35:44.220 --> 35:48.328
This is a real cover
of "Paper" magazine.

35:48.328 --> 35:51.100
<i>This is something that we
canleave here right nowand pick
up,</i>

35:51.100 --> 35:55.408
but I will say this.

35:55.408 --> 35:56.845
I would have
thoughtnit was Gigi.

35:56.845 --> 36:00.151
This is not a negative thing

36:00.151 --> 36:02.289
<i>that you look like
Gigi Hadid.</i>

36:02.289 --> 36:03.658
<i>Hello, she's gorgeous,
right?</i>

36:03.658 --> 36:05.796
You can make this work for
you, looking like someone.

36:05.796 --> 36:09.203
Because then your
personality comes out.

36:09.203 --> 36:11.842
Hey, do you know how many
people say that I look like so
many other people

36:11.842 --> 36:14.413
that when I came out,
it was, like, never-ending.

36:14.413 --> 36:17.019
And at the end of the day,
time tells.

36:17.019 --> 36:19.791
So it's now time for you

36:19.791 --> 36:22.429
to just really let
peopleget to know you.

36:22.429 --> 36:24.534
You're very nice, but I'm still
not getting superstar from you.

36:24.534 --> 36:29.276
I believe that
you're a superstar in pictures.

36:29.276 --> 36:31.715
<i>I haven't seen
it in person,</i>

36:31.715 --> 36:33.719
And I feel like we're
gonna have to start seeing that
really soon

36:33.719 --> 36:37.159
because standing behind you
are girls who are crushing that.

36:37.159 --> 36:40.365
- Okay.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

36:40.365 --> 36:44.440
Finally, Tatiana.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.210
Tatiana, I know you were in
the bottom three last week,

36:46.210 --> 36:49.383
The judges have been
saying that they feel
you've been coasting.

36:49.383 --> 36:51.888
- How do you feel about
that? - I definitely take it in,

36:51.888 --> 36:53.391
and I definitely
understood what they mean by
that.

36:53.391 --> 36:55.996
Physically, the photos,

36:55.996 --> 36:57.800
I feel like they weren't
as good as I could have done.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.403
But I just want you guys
to know that I'm never
satisfied.

36:59.403 --> 37:01.073
<i>I'm never coasting
in my head.</i>

37:01.073 --> 37:03.646
So shall we take a look?

37:03.646 --> 37:05.148
Ashley:I love the new
makeup. I love the straight
hair.

37:05.148 --> 37:08.321
I love the chill... what.

37:08.321 --> 37:09.657
Rita: <i>The fact
thatyou're effortless</i>

37:09.657 --> 37:11.828
makes me love you so much
because you're not posing.

37:11.828 --> 37:16.938
<i>The hat kind of-- it
looks like it's floating.</i>

37:16.938 --> 37:17.974
<i>It looks like it-- you
don't even care that it's on
your head.</i>

37:17.974 --> 37:21.079
Très jolie, madame.

37:21.079 --> 37:23.317
<i>It's the body language,
the pose you're modeling.</i>

37:23.317 --> 37:25.556
<i>to the tip of your--
point of finger,</i>

37:25.556 --> 37:27.493
it's all--it's all right.

37:27.493 --> 37:29.163
I'm so happy that we have
this cover.

37:29.163 --> 37:31.568
Because I think
you're gonna be a superstar.

37:31.568 --> 37:35.275
You have everything it takes,

37:35.275 --> 37:38.113
but sometimes on
set,like on this one,

37:38.113 --> 37:40.586
you were very unsure
of yourself.

37:40.586 --> 37:42.857
So I need you to just
take it to the end

37:42.857 --> 37:45.395
or we're gonna let someone
else take it from you.

37:45.395 --> 37:47.967
- Okay.
- Thank you.

37:47.967 --> 37:49.571
Ladies, before I dismiss
you, I just want you to know

37:49.571 --> 37:53.411
it's getting really tough.

37:53.411 --> 37:55.415
Remember, it's not
justabout today's photo.

37:55.415 --> 37:57.586
Now we're talkingabout
your body of work.

38:13.117 --> 38:17.627
Models, welcome back.

38:17.627 --> 38:19.964
The judges have deliberated.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.135
<i>If I call your name,
you will be staying
another week</i>

38:22.135 --> 38:25.308
<i>to prove you havewhat it
takes to benext top model.</i>

38:25.308 --> 38:28.982
The first name
I'm going to call...

38:32.890 --> 38:36.832
- Cody-lee.
- Thank you.

38:36.832 --> 38:39.737
Rita:Congratulations.

38:39.737 --> 38:41.340
The second name
I'm going to call...

38:41.340 --> 38:44.781
<i>India.</i>

38:44.781 --> 38:46.685
Thank you.

38:46.685 --> 38:48.855
<i>Tatiana.</i>

38:50.491 --> 38:50.959
Three girls left,
but only two spaces.

38:58.642 --> 39:02.684
<i>Coryanne.</i>

39:02.684 --> 39:05.154
Thank you.

39:05.154 --> 39:07.826
Will Courtney and Tash
please step forward?

39:12.035 --> 39:16.945
Courtney,
you walked on set

39:16.945 --> 39:19.383
sure that you could
nailthis beauty shot.

39:19.383 --> 39:22.857
but up close,
you seem less so confident.

39:22.857 --> 39:27.032
You have the undeniable
faceof a model,

39:27.032 --> 39:29.571
but being a boss
means being confident

39:29.571 --> 39:33.344
in any kind of photo.

39:33.344 --> 39:37.019
Tash, your confidence
is your greatest asset,

39:37.019 --> 39:41.728
but it's also
your greatest liability.

39:41.728 --> 39:45.201
Last week,your picture
was incredible.

39:45.201 --> 39:49.175
And hands down,
we made the right choice
to bring you back.

39:49.175 --> 39:52.716
but this week's covernwas
not your finest work,

39:52.716 --> 39:56.223
whether or not you agree.

39:56.223 --> 39:59.062
Your inabilityto see your flaws

39:59.062 --> 40:02.402
could be your downfall.

40:02.402 --> 40:05.709
<i>So who stays?</i>

40:10.519 --> 40:14.994
<i>Courtney,
congratulations.</i>

40:14.994 --> 40:16.698
Please join the
restnof the girls.

40:19.002 --> 40:23.545
Oh, I can't be stopped.

40:23.545 --> 40:24.880
- You can't be stopped.
- Can't be stopped.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.352
I'm a warrior.

40:27.352 --> 40:28.889
Coming back into this
competition, I have no regrets.

40:28.889 --> 40:30.793
<i>I proved to myself
that I'm a fighter.</i>

40:30.793 --> 40:34.033
<i>I think I owned my photo.</i>

40:34.033 --> 40:36.270
<i>It's not what the judges
wanted, that's fine,</i>

40:36.270 --> 40:37.071
<i>but it's what I wanted.
I was myself.</i>

40:40.077 --> 40:40.779
My other half
is still in here fighting,

40:45.221 --> 40:46.724
and she's amazing, and I'm
glad that the judges can see it.

40:46.724 --> 40:48.762
<i>She's gonna kill it.</i>

40:58.414 --> 41:02.389
We're gonna focus on an
aspect that I'm very excited
about:

41:02.389 --> 41:05.762
Acting.

41:05.762 --> 41:08.067
Acting, I suck at.

41:08.067 --> 41:09.938
- You're the crazy one.
- That was bad.

41:09.938 --> 41:12.977
You're gonna let
your inner crazy run wild!

41:12.977 --> 41:17.720
It got a little weird.
Work your hair.

41:17.720 --> 41:20.291
She looks like a unicorn
( bleep ) on her face.

41:20.291 --> 41:22.764
From here to here,
you're a supermodel.

41:22.764 --> 41:24.767
From here to here,
a supermarket.

41:24.767 --> 41:26.772
Oh, my God, Law!
( chuckles )

41:26.772 --> 41:27.773
- ( sobbing )
- You're so emotional right now.

41:27.773 --> 41:29.610
This is crazy.

41:31.915 --> 41:32.148
We see your beauty.
