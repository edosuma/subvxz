00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
 <i>- Previously, on</i> The Borgias...

00:09.000 --> 00:11.300
- [Whispering]: I have waited
a lifetime for this moment.

00:11.300 --> 00:14.534
I will not forgive failure...
- We will not fail you,
Father.

00:14.534 --> 00:17.801
- Maybe Papa will
become pope, and you can
be who you want to be.

00:17.801 --> 00:20.300
- I shall fight you.
- With any means at my disposal.

00:20.300 --> 00:23.000
- I do tend to win
whatever battles I fight.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.501
- Cardinal Borgia has
the required majority.

00:26.501 --> 00:29.567
- You're not in
mourning, mother.
- But perhaps I am.

00:29.567 --> 00:32.868
- What are we gaining?
- Does Papa have
so many enemies?

00:32.868 --> 00:35.868
- As our father, perhaps not.
But as pope...

00:35.868 --> 00:38.767
We have placed the papal
mitre in the hands of an ape.

00:38.767 --> 00:41.667
I beg you now to release me
of my vows.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.634
- I would be a prince of state,
Father.

00:43.634 --> 00:46.400
Juan can bear arms
for the Borgia family

00:46.400 --> 00:49.334
- But I swear, if God
does not protect us, I shall.

00:49.334 --> 00:52.033
- Whatever you're being paid,
I'll double it.

00:52.033 --> 00:54.868
- The pope cannot love?
- Not only must he be chaste;

00:54.868 --> 00:56.868
he must be seen
to be chaste.

00:56.868 --> 01:00.033
- Simony! I charge you now
in public!

01:00.033 --> 01:04.766
- They all want you dead.
- Serve this... to Orsini.

01:04.766 --> 01:06.434
- [Orsini]: Poison.
- Poison!

01:06.434 --> 01:08.667
- The poison was meant for us.
- You don't poison the pope!

01:08.667 --> 01:10.000
You poison a rabid dog!

01:10.000 --> 01:12.801
It offends nature, it offends
God Himself!

01:12.801 --> 01:14.400
- So, God will take
his revenge, then.
- With our help.

02:50.334 --> 02:52.334
- Excellent service.

02:52.334 --> 02:55.834
- I fear it is not over yet.
- What do you mean?

02:55.834 --> 02:59.334
- Well, there's more
to your Borgia family
than father and son.

02:59.334 --> 03:03.501
- What do you mean?
- I mean we must hurry, My Lord.

03:03.501 --> 03:05.534
Your whole family's
in danger.

03:17.934 --> 03:19.934
- Micheletto!
- Am I too late?

03:19.934 --> 03:22.567
- We were waiting for you.
- Then you're too late!

03:22.567 --> 03:25.901
[Groaning in pain]
- What are you doing?!

03:25.901 --> 03:27.567
Ah!

03:27.567 --> 03:29.467
[Yelling]

03:33.901 --> 03:35.434
- Allow me, My Lord.

03:35.434 --> 03:37.834
[Muffled yelling]

03:45.434 --> 03:48.601
- Guards!

03:48.601 --> 03:51.667
- [Guard]: General!
- With me, quickly!

03:51.667 --> 03:54.133
Come on!

03:54.133 --> 03:57.267
Get out of my way!

04:02.801 --> 04:05.334
Pray somewhere else,
Cardinals.

04:08.133 --> 04:10.133
Arrest this household.

04:12.634 --> 04:15.667
- You planned this massacre
thoroughly.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.334
- If I had planned it, My Lord,

04:17.334 --> 04:20.567
believe me, we would not be
having this conversation.

04:20.567 --> 04:23.601
- You're that meticulous?

04:23.601 --> 04:26.534
- Always.
[Grunting with effort]

04:26.534 --> 04:28.834
- And who planned it?

04:32.100 --> 04:35.667
- Cardinal Orsini.

04:35.667 --> 04:37.167
- And Della Rovere?

04:39.901 --> 04:43.267
- I know nothing of him.

04:43.267 --> 04:44.801
In this affair,

04:44.801 --> 04:47.367
[Panting]

04:47.367 --> 04:50.200
I had but one master.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.334
- And now?

04:53.334 --> 04:58.367
- And now
I am like a stray dog,

04:58.367 --> 05:00.200
masterless.

05:02.200 --> 05:06.033
Unless your kind offer
still stands.

05:06.033 --> 05:10.067
- You could have...
let things take their course...

05:10.067 --> 05:12.367
Betrayed me.

05:12.367 --> 05:16.033
Most of your kind do.
- My kind?

05:16.033 --> 05:19.968
I do not have
a kind.

05:23.667 --> 05:26.667
And I suspect
neither do you.

05:30.067 --> 05:33.334
- Your name,
sweet assassin.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.167
[Panting]

05:41.167 --> 05:43.167
- Micheletto.

05:43.167 --> 05:46.167
- You must prove yourself
worthy of my trust, then.

05:46.167 --> 05:51.033
- This is not proof enough?
- Perhaps. Perhaps not.

05:51.033 --> 05:55.400
Can you dispose
of these corpses?
- You would keep them secret?

05:55.400 --> 05:57.634
- More than that.
I would keep you secret.

06:00.467 --> 06:04.634
Dump them in the Tiber.
Meet me by the Vatican gates

06:04.634 --> 06:08.501
in two hours' time. We shall
discuss your future service.

06:15.067 --> 06:18.000
[Whispering]: Mother.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.968
- Are you trying
to frighten me?

06:21.968 --> 06:23.968
- I'm sorry, Mother.

06:26.167 --> 06:29.467
- Why are you here,
Cesare?

06:29.467 --> 06:31.934
- I imagine things--

06:31.934 --> 06:34.000
murders,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.601
blood-spattered throats,

06:36.601 --> 06:39.334
poisoned chalices.

06:39.334 --> 06:43.334
- Perhaps you're not wrong.
We have many enemies now.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.501
- And Lucrezia?

06:47.501 --> 06:52.000
- She's sleeping.
You miss her that much?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.167
- Always.

06:54.167 --> 06:57.667
If anything happened
to her, I'd...

06:57.667 --> 06:59.767
...I'd die.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.868
- What could possibly
happen?

07:02.868 --> 07:05.868
- I'm putting a guard
on the house.

07:05.868 --> 07:08.367
- Is it so dangerous
outside?

07:08.367 --> 07:10.367
- We are in a different city
now.

07:10.367 --> 07:13.133
- Is it still
called Rome?

07:13.133 --> 07:15.634
- I'm not sure
it has a name.

07:17.801 --> 07:20.801
Father.

07:20.801 --> 07:23.467
Father!

07:23.467 --> 07:25.467
Father, I've had to place
a guard on the--

07:25.467 --> 07:29.934
- The good cardinal, my son,
has been expressing his shock

07:29.934 --> 07:33.334
and dismay
at this evening's outcome.

07:33.334 --> 07:35.501
- Poison, it seems,
was the cause

07:35.501 --> 07:37.968
of Cardinal Orsini's demise.

07:37.968 --> 07:40.000
- One shudders
at the thought.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.567
- As to who poisoned him,

07:41.567 --> 07:44.667
I have no idea.
Perhaps we should

07:44.667 --> 07:48.133
ask ourselves, who benefits most
from his death?

07:48.133 --> 07:50.200
- And what are you implying,
Your Eminence?

07:50.200 --> 07:52.868
- I am implying nothing.

07:52.868 --> 07:55.734
I am merely offering
His Holiness any help I can

07:55.734 --> 07:58.167
in unmasking the culprit.

07:58.167 --> 08:02.400
Our Holy Mother Church can
afford no such scandals.

08:07.033 --> 08:11.701
- We have Orsini's household
staff in irons, Your Holiness.

08:11.701 --> 08:15.200
Cardinal.
- The good cardinal, my brother,

08:15.200 --> 08:19.767
has offered to help us
unmask the culprit
behind this plot.

08:19.767 --> 08:23.234
- We apprehended this wretch
skulking outside by the gate.

08:23.234 --> 08:26.033
- A plot, by definition,
needs more than one participant,

08:26.033 --> 08:29.534
does it not?
- Do you recognize him?

08:36.868 --> 08:39.933
- Didn't he pour the wine?

08:39.933 --> 08:43.067
- [Cesare]: Do you know
this man, Cardinal Della Rovere?

08:43.067 --> 08:45.334
- I know he attended
at the cardinal's table,

08:45.334 --> 08:46.801
but there were many of those.

08:46.801 --> 08:51.968
Beyond that,
nothing.

08:51.968 --> 08:55.000
- If this creature is
indeed the poisoner,

08:55.000 --> 08:59.200
some hours on the strappado
should loosen his tongue.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.701
- See if he talks.

09:04.634 --> 09:07.767
[Grunting]

09:07.767 --> 09:09.968
- I have a dilemma:

09:09.968 --> 09:12.267
[Grunting]

09:12.267 --> 09:14.801
whether to flay you
at night...

09:14.801 --> 09:16.834
[Grunting]

09:16.834 --> 09:18.767
...or at dawn.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.133
[Grunting]

09:21.133 --> 09:23.133
[Groaning]

09:23.133 --> 09:26.167
- I pity you your
dilemma, My Lord.
- Pity yourself.

09:26.167 --> 09:29.767
- Brother. You have
already exhausted yourself

09:29.767 --> 09:31.300
in our father's defence.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.834
Now I could spend a good hour
questioning this man.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.834
- Is that really a task
for a cleric?

09:39.100 --> 09:41.100
[Grunting in pain]

09:46.501 --> 09:49.501
- Lock the door and go.

09:49.501 --> 09:52.100
Up.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.601
Up!

09:58.167 --> 10:00.667
Would you have talked?

10:00.667 --> 10:03.501
- Only to sing your praises,
My Lord.

10:07.334 --> 10:10.000
- Still want
to earn my trust?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.834
- Eternally, My Lord.

10:14.834 --> 10:17.534
- Lie low for a day, then.

10:17.534 --> 10:21.234
I can have word sent out
that you couldn't be broken.

10:23.467 --> 10:25.634
- And then?

10:25.634 --> 10:27.534
- Then...

10:27.534 --> 10:31.801
...get close to Cardinal
Della Rovere.

10:31.801 --> 10:35.467
Tell me what he thinks.
What he plans.

10:40.133 --> 10:42.634
- Then you must hurt me,
My Lord.

10:44.634 --> 10:47.467
- Haven't I hurt you
enough already?

10:47.467 --> 10:51.667
- To convince this cardinal,
my back must tell its own story.

10:54.334 --> 10:56.667
And I have heard
that he has an interest

10:56.667 --> 10:59.200
in the male torso.

11:02.167 --> 11:07.167
And even I cannot
convincingly whip myself.

11:11.167 --> 11:13.167
So whip me, My Lord.

11:22.434 --> 11:24.534
[Grunting]

11:24.534 --> 11:26.434
Harder.

11:28.434 --> 11:30.734
[Grunting]

11:30.734 --> 11:32.300
Harder, My Lord.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.968
[Grunting]

11:35.968 --> 11:37.534
- And...

11:37.534 --> 11:41.334
[Grunting]
...if you betray me...

11:41.334 --> 11:43.334
[Grunting]

11:43.334 --> 11:45.801
...you will end your days
on that rack.

11:45.801 --> 11:48.968
[Grunting]
- Then it would not be
in my interest to betray you,

11:48.968 --> 11:51.968
My Lord.
- Good.

11:51.968 --> 11:53.734
[Grunting]

11:53.734 --> 11:55.767
- Again!

11:55.767 --> 11:59.834
[Grunting]

11:59.834 --> 12:01.434
Again.

12:01.434 --> 12:03.400
[Grunting]

12:04.667 --> 12:06.667
[Door opening]

12:12.000 --> 12:15.834
- Do you have something
to tell me?

12:15.834 --> 12:18.100
About the night's events?

12:20.934 --> 12:22.934
- Only that...

12:24.934 --> 12:26.968
...I will protect you.

12:26.968 --> 12:30.000
Protect our family.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.868
With my life
if needs be.

12:37.968 --> 12:42.300
- Well, all of the others bought
and sold.

12:42.300 --> 12:45.934
We merely proved ourselves
better at the game.

12:45.934 --> 12:49.100
But we draw the line

12:49.100 --> 12:52.968
at murder,
do we not?

12:57.133 --> 13:01.167
- Orsini drew no such line.

13:09.167 --> 13:11.167
- I see.

13:15.167 --> 13:17.300
So,

13:17.300 --> 13:20.601
we are one less cardinal
this morning.

13:26.767 --> 13:30.267
I was your age
when I became a cardinal.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.100
Seems like yesterday.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.667
This red...

13:35.667 --> 13:39.901
...signifies that you are ready
to spill your blood in defence

13:39.901 --> 13:43.133
of the Christian faith.

13:43.133 --> 13:46.667
- No, Father.
- Are you, my son, ready

13:46.667 --> 13:49.968
to spill your blood in defence
of the Christian faith?

13:49.968 --> 13:51.667
I think you are!

13:51.667 --> 13:53.667
- For the defence
of my family, perhaps.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.901
- That too.
- Give me control

13:55.901 --> 13:59.167
of the papal armies and
I will protect us all.
- We will have one son

13:59.167 --> 14:01.901
in the cloth
and one in armour.

14:01.901 --> 14:04.868
You know our wishes.
- But a cardinal's red?

14:04.868 --> 14:07.033
- And Lucrezia must marry.

14:07.033 --> 14:08.801
- So soon?

14:08.801 --> 14:12.234
- She is 14 years old.
- She is just a child.

14:12.234 --> 14:15.834
- We must bind our enemies
to us. Make friends of them.

14:15.834 --> 14:18.467
And what better way is there
than marriage

14:18.467 --> 14:22.901
You can perform the rite--
as cardinal.

14:22.901 --> 14:26.801
- Am I a cardinal already?

14:35.834 --> 14:38.033
- And they tortured you
for...

14:38.033 --> 14:41.000
...how long?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.534
- A day and a night,
Your Eminence.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.501
- And you revealed?

14:52.501 --> 14:55.501
- There was nothing to reveal,
Your Eminence.

15:03.701 --> 15:05.701
- <i>Ecce homo.</i>

15:08.200 --> 15:11.467
"Behold the man."

15:11.467 --> 15:14.000
They scourged
our saviour thus.

15:17.801 --> 15:21.968
Is it true,
what's being rumoured?

15:21.968 --> 15:26.334
That the good cardinal
inadvertently poisoned himself?

15:26.334 --> 15:29.000
- Who would have profited
from his death?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.501
- Certainly not
Cardinal Orsini.

15:31.501 --> 15:35.434
- Who takes possession
of his properties?
- Borgia.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.934
- Well, then.

15:39.334 --> 15:41.834
- These methods are
not mine.

15:41.834 --> 15:45.334
- You think they are mine,
Your Eminence?

15:45.334 --> 15:48.000
- What are your methods?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.167
- Discretion.

15:50.167 --> 15:51.634
Silence.

15:51.634 --> 15:53.634
- And you have suffered
for your silence.

15:55.634 --> 15:59.200
Why?

15:59.200 --> 16:01.467
- Like you,

16:01.467 --> 16:04.334
I hate this Borgia.

16:06.367 --> 16:09.200
And if I can be
of any use...

16:09.200 --> 16:13.534
- I need someone
I can trust.

16:13.534 --> 16:16.634
- You can trust my hatred
of this Borgia pope.

16:21.868 --> 16:24.667
[Gasping in pain]

16:24.667 --> 16:28.834
- I can trust these wounds
of yours.

16:33.667 --> 16:37.834
- They will last
for a lifetime,

16:37.834 --> 16:40.901
Your Eminence.
- Indeed.

16:42.901 --> 16:45.901
I need to assemble a gathering
of every cardinal

16:45.901 --> 16:49.334
who shares your feelings.

16:49.334 --> 16:52.701
In absolute secrecy.

17:20.133 --> 17:24.800
- May I thank you, Holy Father,
for bequeathing to me
your precious time.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.133
- Go on, my child.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.868
- I have sinned mightily,

17:31.868 --> 17:34.234
Your Holiness,

17:34.234 --> 17:38.267
and know there are some sins
that only the pope can forgive.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.100
- They are few,

17:40.100 --> 17:43.133
but the most grave.

17:45.133 --> 17:46.667
Tell me.

17:48.667 --> 17:52.000
- My husband,
Your Holiness,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.501
has long been...

17:54.501 --> 17:57.067
...distasteful to me.

17:57.067 --> 17:59.267
- I fear...

17:59.267 --> 18:02.667
...you are not the first woman
to share that fate.

18:02.667 --> 18:06.801
- His person
I find repellent.

18:06.801 --> 18:09.634
His advances sicken me.

18:09.634 --> 18:13.667
His hand upon my body makes me
retch with disgust.

18:13.667 --> 18:18.634
- Have you denied him...

18:18.634 --> 18:21.000
...your duties as a wife?

18:23.300 --> 18:25.801
- No, Your Holiness.

18:25.801 --> 18:29.934
I performed them
as the Church says I must.

18:29.934 --> 18:31.434
- So I...

18:31.434 --> 18:34.133
...fail
to discern the sin.

18:38.667 --> 18:42.167
- I found myself
with child.

18:42.167 --> 18:44.501
The thought
of this body of mine,

18:44.501 --> 18:47.334
marred by the presence
of his offspring--

18:49.334 --> 18:51.667
inside--

18:51.667 --> 18:54.667
drove me to an act
of transgression that...

18:58.667 --> 19:01.000
- Go on, my daughter.

19:03.501 --> 19:07.167
- I put an end
to my pregnancy.

19:09.334 --> 19:12.200
- That is indeed
most grave.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.200
- A sin...

19:16.200 --> 19:18.634
...that only
the pope...

19:18.634 --> 19:21.968
...can forgive.
- Only God may forgive.

19:23.968 --> 19:27.133
But we may intercede...

19:27.133 --> 19:30.334
...on your behalf.

19:34.234 --> 19:37.334
- Then, please,
Your Holiness,

19:37.334 --> 19:41.467
...beg for me His mercy.

19:41.467 --> 19:43.801
- And...

19:43.801 --> 19:47.834
...your husband?
He knows of this?

19:47.834 --> 19:49.834
- He knows nothing.

19:49.834 --> 19:54.067
He has retired to his castle
in Bassano.

19:54.067 --> 19:57.334
He satisfies his lust on me
no longer.

19:57.334 --> 19:59.267
- And you are...

19:59.267 --> 20:03.534
now... chaste?

20:06.968 --> 20:09.467
- I have no one,
Your Holiness.

20:09.467 --> 20:12.968
- Then perhaps
that is to be your penitence--

20:12.968 --> 20:18.167
to follow your husband
to Bassano, as is your duty.

20:18.167 --> 20:21.167
- I would prefer a life
of destitution, Your Holiness.

20:21.167 --> 20:23.167
- Then love God.

20:23.167 --> 20:26.968
And find peace
within the walls of a nunnery.

20:26.968 --> 20:30.067
- Can one find peace
in such a love, Your Holiness?

20:30.067 --> 20:33.601
- It is what we must do,

20:33.601 --> 20:36.834
Giulia Farnese.

20:42.067 --> 20:45.067
- I fear
I may lack Your Holiness's will.

20:45.067 --> 20:49.667
I am still young,
Your Holiness,

20:49.667 --> 20:52.200
and my body, I am sure,

20:52.200 --> 20:54.868
could find, and give,
much happiness

20:54.868 --> 20:57.467
if my soul could
find peace.

21:01.868 --> 21:04.000
- Do you beg forgiveness
from God

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
for the enormity
of your crime?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.367
- I do so daily.

21:08.367 --> 21:11.200
Your Holiness, my soul yearns
for its punishment.

21:11.200 --> 21:14.167
- Then you must fast.

21:14.167 --> 21:18.267
From matins
till evensong.

21:18.267 --> 21:21.601
And flagellate your naked body
twice nightly.

21:21.601 --> 21:23.434
- With knotted cord,

21:23.434 --> 21:27.534
Your Holiness?
- Cord of silk will suffice.

21:27.534 --> 21:31.200
To destroy the beauty
the Lord has granted you

21:31.200 --> 21:35.200
would be
to compound your sin.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.400
 <i>E go te absolve...</i>

21:37.400 --> 21:40.334
 <i>...ab omnibus censuris,</i>
 <i>et peccatis,</i>

21:40.334 --> 21:42.501
 <i>in nomine Patris,</i>

21:42.501 --> 21:44.734
 <i>et Filii,</i>
 <i>et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

21:44.734 --> 21:47.234
- Amen.
- Amen.

21:55.067 --> 21:57.067
[Sighing]

21:57.067 --> 21:59.100
Giulia Farnese.

22:01.334 --> 22:02.901
- Your Holiness?

22:04.901 --> 22:07.400
- One of your lineage...

22:07.400 --> 22:10.868
...to be destitute--
we cannot allow it.

22:10.868 --> 22:15.567
We must find you...
some...

22:15.567 --> 22:18.567
...temporary and...

22:18.567 --> 22:20.567
...temporal refuge.

22:29.033 --> 22:32.467
- [Man]: Keep the fire
away from the straw!

22:32.467 --> 22:34.634
- [Man]: It is!
- [Man]: Good!

22:40.300 --> 22:44.067
- [Man]: Boy, keep the banners
and colours all together.
- [Man]: Right, sir!

22:44.067 --> 22:48.801
- Some of you voted
for him,

22:48.801 --> 22:54.634
for which unfortunate choice
you are now forgiven.
[Quiet chuckling]

22:54.634 --> 22:57.300
But most of you voted
against.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.634
We have assembled the barest
of majorities.

22:59.634 --> 23:02.133
But then,
this Borgia pope was elected

23:02.133 --> 23:04.767
with just such
a majority.

23:08.167 --> 23:12.334
- The cardinal's demise was...
sudden.

23:12.334 --> 23:14.767
- So it seems.

23:16.934 --> 23:21.234
- But his palace is ideal
as a...

23:21.234 --> 23:25.234
...place
of penitence...

23:25.234 --> 23:27.267
...and...

23:27.267 --> 23:29.267
...self-reflection.

23:42.634 --> 23:46.734
- [Rovere]: If it can be proven,
what many of us suspect--

23:46.734 --> 23:49.667
corruption, simony,

23:49.667 --> 23:53.234
the blatant sale
of the sacred offices,

23:53.234 --> 23:57.767
and worse, the utter degradation
of the office of the papacy

23:57.767 --> 23:59.767
in the eyes
of the Christian world...

24:05.400 --> 24:07.968
- [Borgia]: You must think
of your sojourn here

24:07.968 --> 24:11.133
as a retreat.

24:11.133 --> 24:12.667
- A retreat?

24:16.167 --> 24:19.367
- The cardinal had this tunnel
built.

24:19.367 --> 24:23.334
It leads
inside the Vatican walls.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
If you ever find yourself
in need of...

24:32.000 --> 24:35.501
...spiritual comfort...

24:35.501 --> 24:39.033
...in your loneliness...
- Your Holiness.

24:39.033 --> 24:43.467
- You must not be afraid
to avail of it.

24:43.467 --> 24:45.701
Day or night.

24:50.834 --> 24:52.834
We shall leave you now.

24:55.167 --> 24:58.601
- This passage goes
both ways.

24:58.601 --> 25:02.334
Your Holiness must feel
free to visit...

25:02.334 --> 25:07.300
...if God's love were ever
to leave him wanting.

25:11.367 --> 25:16.501
- The cardinal summons me
in the dead of night.
Is there a reason?

25:16.501 --> 25:20.000
- These are turbulent times,
Father.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
 <i>- Dottore...</i>

25:32.234 --> 25:34.567
You can leave us now.

25:38.033 --> 25:43.067
I need advice, <i>dottore,</i>
on a delicate matter.

25:43.067 --> 25:45.834
The deposition
of a pope.

25:47.834 --> 25:50.501
- Delicate indeed.

25:50.501 --> 25:53.934
And, if I may say so,
dangerous.

27:35.667 --> 27:38.200
- Stop that.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.701
You have done penance
enough.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.501
- Who then will forgive us,
Your Holiness?

27:51.501 --> 27:53.501
- God will.

28:36.901 --> 28:38.901
[Muttering]

28:38.901 --> 28:42.100
- Huggucio of Pisa states:

28:42.100 --> 28:47.033
 <i>"Ecce publico fornicator,</i>
 <i>publico habet concubinem..."</i>

28:47.033 --> 28:50.601
- The pope
who publicly fornicates,
publicly keeps a concubine--

28:50.601 --> 28:53.634
- Can indeed be
deposed,

28:53.634 --> 28:59.701
because to scandalize the Church
is in itself heresy.

28:59.701 --> 29:04.133
But one would need
firm evidence

29:04.133 --> 29:07.133
of notorious
and public lechery.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.534
- Whose bed is this?

29:13.534 --> 29:15.868
- Yours,
of course.

29:18.300 --> 29:20.300
- Whose bed was this?

29:24.033 --> 29:27.133
- It belonged to a cardinal
and a fool.

29:29.133 --> 29:31.300
- What kind of fool?

29:33.300 --> 29:36.400
- The kind of fool
who doesn't understand that

29:36.400 --> 29:39.234
God's work can be done

29:39.234 --> 29:41.634
even by the most unlikely
of his servants.

29:41.634 --> 29:45.133
And that Rome needs now is--
- You.

29:47.667 --> 29:49.167
- Power.

29:54.601 --> 29:58.834
You're so beautiful,
Giulia Farnese.

30:00.834 --> 30:03.834
I would
have you painted.

30:32.701 --> 30:35.968
- She is beautiful.
- She is.

30:37.968 --> 30:40.300
- More beautiful
than your painting.

30:40.300 --> 30:45.234
- I've just begun.
- You must do better, then.

30:45.234 --> 30:48.300
Her hair curls, here.

30:51.133 --> 30:52.667
Who is she?

30:52.667 --> 30:55.567
- Giulia Farnese.

30:55.567 --> 30:57.968
At your service.

30:57.968 --> 31:01.000
- Why is he painting you,

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Giulia Farnese?

31:03.000 --> 31:06.334
- Your father, the pope,
commissioned him.

31:06.334 --> 31:08.133
- Will he paint one of me?

31:08.133 --> 31:10.267
- I will commission him, now.

31:10.267 --> 31:13.234
[Goat bleating]

31:13.234 --> 31:15.234
- Why are you holding
a baby goat?

31:15.234 --> 31:18.501
- It will become
a unicorn.

31:18.501 --> 31:20.501
- Then I want a unicorn.

31:24.267 --> 31:27.834
Or even better,
a sea horse.

31:32.934 --> 31:36.934
I want to lie
on a bed of seashells
and have a sea horse in my lap.

31:36.934 --> 31:38.801
- [Giulia]: Like this one?

31:43.300 --> 31:46.234
- Yes.

31:46.234 --> 31:48.667
Just like this one.

31:48.667 --> 31:50.567
- You must have it, then.

31:50.567 --> 31:52.801
- I can?

31:56.634 --> 31:59.334
- It's a gift.

31:59.334 --> 32:03.267
From Giulia
to Lucrezia.

32:03.267 --> 32:07.467
- Can I kiss you, then?
- Only if we are to be friends.

32:07.467 --> 32:10.467
- We are friends already.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.767
I am to have
my portrait painted, Mama.

32:17.767 --> 32:21.100
- You are?
- But I don't want a goat,

32:21.100 --> 32:26.267
or a unicorn. I told Giulia
I want a sea horse
like this one.

32:26.267 --> 32:29.267
- You told who?
- Giulia Farnese.

32:31.267 --> 32:33.968
- Giulia Farnese is having
her portrait painted?

32:33.968 --> 32:35.834
- By Pinturicchio.

32:35.834 --> 32:38.234
Papa commissioned him.

32:42.133 --> 32:43.801
- Ah.

32:43.801 --> 32:47.667
- She gave me
this pendant.

32:47.667 --> 32:51.634
I think a sea horse is better
than a unicorn, don't you Mama?

32:51.634 --> 32:55.734
- I've heard she is beautiful,
this Giulia Farnese.

32:58.901 --> 33:02.567
- Papa thinks so.
- I am sure he does.

33:06.701 --> 33:09.868
- A different type of beauty
to yours, Mama.

33:09.868 --> 33:14.467
Not Spanish.
Italian.

33:14.467 --> 33:17.667
Her hair is light,
and full of curls.

33:23.767 --> 33:26.434
- And where did you meet her,
Lucrezia?

33:28.434 --> 33:30.434
- In Papa's rooms.

33:30.434 --> 33:32.434
In the Vatican.

33:40.234 --> 33:43.968
- [Man]: Please, My Lady!
- [Man]: Your Holiness!

33:43.968 --> 33:45.467
- My dear.

33:45.467 --> 33:48.634
- You told me
that the pope can love God,

33:48.634 --> 33:50.701
but to be seen
to love anyone else

33:50.701 --> 33:52.601
would be impossible.
- Your Holiness--

33:52.601 --> 33:54.634
- Now, now--
- Shall we remove ourselves?

33:54.634 --> 33:56.634
- That the pope must be
chaste,

33:56.634 --> 33:59.634
and he must be seen
to be chaste.

33:59.634 --> 34:02.300
Don't you want them to hear?
That you have a new whore?!

34:02.300 --> 34:04.567
- Mother!
- Farnese!

34:04.567 --> 34:06.434
- Get out!
- That you've installed her

34:06.434 --> 34:08.367
in the Orsini Palace?
- What?

34:08.367 --> 34:10.367
- We were--
- Be gone!

34:10.367 --> 34:12.967
- I banished my husband
for your sake!

34:12.967 --> 34:16.501
- You are the mother
of my children! You will always
have a special place in my life.

34:16.501 --> 34:19.501
- What about your promise?!
- There is no one...

34:19.501 --> 34:21.833
...no one,
closer to me than you.

34:21.833 --> 34:23.400
- Why her?!

34:23.400 --> 34:26.132
- She was in need!
I had to help her.

34:26.132 --> 34:29.100
You were destitute once!

34:29.100 --> 34:31.501
- [Cesare]: Be gone!
Out!

34:31.501 --> 34:33.501
- [Man]: We were
in consultation--

34:33.501 --> 34:36.000
- [Man]: Your Grace,
we are leaving.

34:45.634 --> 34:47.701
- Don't lie to me.

34:47.701 --> 34:49.199
To me, you cannot lie.

34:49.199 --> 34:50.868
- Then don't challenge me.

34:50.868 --> 34:53.367
And never, ever
within these sacred walls.

34:55.367 --> 34:59.367
- I've dreamed
about this room
and what it might do to you.

35:01.534 --> 35:04.033
We need
a new understanding, then.

35:06.033 --> 35:08.701
- Perhaps.

35:08.701 --> 35:11.200
- I'll keep my peace.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.534
But I won't be
humiliated.

35:16.367 --> 35:18.000
- I would have peace.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.501
- You commissioned a portrait
of her.

35:21.501 --> 35:23.968
I shall have
a portrait too

35:23.968 --> 35:25.868
by the same new genius
you found.

35:25.868 --> 35:29.000
- Pinturicchio.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.334
He is good,
but he's...

35:32.334 --> 35:34.834
...expensive.

35:34.834 --> 35:38.501
- All of Rome is yours
for the taking.

35:38.501 --> 35:41.334
Make sure
he does me justice.

35:41.334 --> 35:44.334
I was beautiful
once, no?

35:46.334 --> 35:48.634
- You still are.

35:48.634 --> 35:52.000
- We agreed, did we not,
that you would not lie?

35:54.901 --> 35:59.367
- He has placed his new whore
in Orsini's palace, no?

35:59.367 --> 36:01.534
- I believe so,
Your Eminence.

36:01.534 --> 36:04.667
- Question the staff, then,
in secret,

36:04.667 --> 36:08.701
and in any way
you see fit.

36:08.701 --> 36:11.234
We need evidence
of lechery,

36:11.234 --> 36:14.267
fornication--

36:14.267 --> 36:18.767
 <i>publico habet concubinem.</i>

36:21.100 --> 36:23.300
- Get these to the Deacon-
Cardinal for signatures.

36:23.300 --> 36:24.801
- Yes, Your Eminence.

36:34.167 --> 36:36.667
- He has met in secret
with those cardinals

36:36.667 --> 36:39.501
that hate your father.

36:39.501 --> 36:41.334
With Johannes Burchard,

36:41.334 --> 36:43.767
he is making a case
for your father's deposition.

36:43.767 --> 36:45.400
- On what grounds?

36:47.801 --> 36:50.968
- Notorious
and public lechery...

36:50.968 --> 36:54.033
- Lechery?
My father?

36:54.033 --> 36:56.200
God forbid.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.734
Has he evidence?

36:57.734 --> 37:01.100
- He means to find it.

37:04.367 --> 37:07.701
- Then perhaps
we should find it first,

37:07.701 --> 37:10.133
and silence it
before it speaks.

37:12.467 --> 37:15.033
- Your mother was somewhat
troubled yesterday.

37:15.033 --> 37:19.834
She finds the change
in our life difficult.

37:19.834 --> 37:21.834
- So I noticed.

37:21.834 --> 37:24.133
- Do what you can
to keep her out of here.

37:26.133 --> 37:28.634
- It would help, maybe,
if you were more discreet

37:28.634 --> 37:31.133
in your affections.
- But I--

37:31.133 --> 37:33.834
- You are aware, Holy Father,
of the plots against you?

37:33.834 --> 37:37.167
- Oh, what would Rome be
without a good plot?

37:39.167 --> 37:41.667
- The College of Cardinals is
split down the middle.

37:41.667 --> 37:46.000
- What? Well, perhaps
we need some more cardinals.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.501
- Johannes Burchard has been
asked for an opinion...

37:50.501 --> 37:52.868
[Chuckling]
- Dear old Johannes.

37:52.868 --> 37:56.501
He does give excellent opinion.
- On your deposition, Father.

37:58.501 --> 38:00.033
- Indeed.

38:00.033 --> 38:03.334
- There are certain things
I could speak of...

38:05.334 --> 38:08.367
...for a price.

38:08.367 --> 38:11.701
- Don't worry.
You'll get paid.

38:11.701 --> 38:13.534
- I would need to be.

38:15.534 --> 38:18.634
I have seen things
within these walls

38:18.634 --> 38:22.968
that would shock a brace
of courtesans.

38:22.968 --> 38:26.033
- Well, now, there's no need
to shock a courtesan, is there?

38:26.033 --> 38:30.200
A brace of cardinals,
perhaps.

38:38.534 --> 38:40.567
[Door closing]

38:40.567 --> 38:44.501
[Bell tolling outside]

38:44.501 --> 38:48.868
- You were asked
for a judgement, I believe,

38:48.868 --> 38:54.100
some nights ago?
- Your Holiness, as an expert

38:54.100 --> 38:57.934
on canon law, when asked for
a judgement, I must provide it.

38:57.934 --> 39:00.300
- Please sit.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.834
I would have
your opinion, then,

39:06.834 --> 39:11.200
dear Johannes,
on the expansion

39:11.200 --> 39:13.934
of the College
of Cardinals.

39:13.934 --> 39:18.267
- It is the pope's prerogative
to appoint whom he wishes,

39:18.267 --> 39:20.534
Your Holiness.
- To whatever number he wishes?

39:20.534 --> 39:22.501
- Ah, well,

39:22.501 --> 39:25.033
how many cardinals did
His Holiness have in mind?

39:25.033 --> 39:29.367
- How many would be needed
to make it safe for our papacy?

39:35.133 --> 39:37.434
- Oh, dear.
- Come, come, Johannes.

39:37.434 --> 39:41.133
You must be aware of the plots
against us?

39:41.133 --> 39:43.567
You could even,
if viewed with an unkind eye,

39:43.567 --> 39:46.267
be seen to be party
to them.

39:46.267 --> 39:49.167
- When asked for an opinion,
Your Holiness, you know

39:49.167 --> 39:51.167
that I must
provide it.

39:51.167 --> 39:55.501
- Ah. So,
your opinion, then.

39:55.501 --> 40:00.868
How many new cardinals
to preserve our papacy?

40:00.868 --> 40:03.667
- Umm...

40:07.267 --> 40:11.167
A baker's dozen, I would say.
- Mm!

40:11.167 --> 40:13.167
Thirteen!

40:15.167 --> 40:19.234
And we can appoint them
all at once?

40:19.234 --> 40:22.133
Without the vote
of conclave?

40:22.133 --> 40:24.767
- Such a great number would need
a precedent.

40:24.767 --> 40:26.968
- Oh.

40:28.968 --> 40:32.133
Find one, then.

40:32.133 --> 40:35.100
- Your Holiness.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.100
- I have received advice

40:37.100 --> 40:41.634
from our most supreme expert
in canon law,

40:41.634 --> 40:44.801
that a pope's election may be
overturned

40:44.801 --> 40:47.801
if we can provide evidence
of lechery,

40:47.801 --> 40:50.868
both notorious and public.

40:50.868 --> 40:53.501
That evidence
I present to you now.

41:08.334 --> 41:10.200
Leave us, Micheletto.

41:16.501 --> 41:19.934
[Doors closing]
And now, my dear,

41:19.934 --> 41:22.434
tell us
what you have witnessed.

41:22.434 --> 41:27.133
- There is a passage, connecting
the palace to the Vatican.

41:27.133 --> 41:31.434
His Holiness makes use
of it... nightly.

41:31.434 --> 41:33.801
- And then?

41:33.801 --> 41:39.133
- He enters her bedroom
while she chastises herself.

41:39.133 --> 41:43.501
And I blush to even describe
what happens next.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.267
- Spare us nothing.

41:45.267 --> 41:48.767
- I wanted seashells
and a sea horse.

41:48.767 --> 41:50.767
- But you have a sea horse,
my love.

41:50.767 --> 41:53.133
- No, I mean a real one.
Like your goat.

41:53.133 --> 41:57.300
- But real sea horses are tiny,
my love.

41:57.300 --> 42:01.000
- Am I your love?
- I would dearly love you to be.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
- My mother hates you.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.067
- You will learn, my dear,

42:06.067 --> 42:09.868
as women, we control
so little of our destiny.

42:09.868 --> 42:12.501
Men do.
- And?

42:12.501 --> 42:16.934
- The outcome is,
we hate each other.

42:16.934 --> 42:20.100
But we should not.
- Who should we hate, then?

42:20.100 --> 42:23.968
Men?
- No, my love.

42:23.968 --> 42:27.601
It's in our nature
to love them.

42:27.601 --> 42:31.267
But we should protect ourselves
against them.

42:31.267 --> 42:34.467
Against our feelings
towards them.

42:34.467 --> 42:37.634
We will all of us,
one day, be replaced.

42:37.634 --> 42:40.100
- Are you giving me
instruction?

42:40.100 --> 42:43.667
- Would you like me to?
- I think I would.

42:45.667 --> 42:49.667
What weapons do I have with
which to protect myself?
- Your beauty.

42:49.667 --> 42:53.667
- Is that a weapon?
- It can be deadly,

42:53.667 --> 42:55.634
when well used.

42:55.634 --> 42:59.434
But beauty doesn't last
forever.

42:59.434 --> 43:02.467
Gone, like the snows
of last year.

43:02.467 --> 43:05.467
- What else?
- When beauty fades?

43:07.501 --> 43:09.000
Your wit.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.167
Your intelligence.

43:11.167 --> 43:14.968
- And I have those weapons?
- Oh, in abundance.

43:14.968 --> 43:20.267
You should cultivate them.
You will be married some day.

43:20.267 --> 43:25.968
You may need them--
sooner than you think.

43:25.968 --> 43:29.067
- Is she pretty,
this piece of evidence?

43:29.067 --> 43:31.868
- She has her charms,
My Lord.

43:31.868 --> 43:34.934
- Perhaps you could see
that she takes a vow of silence.

43:37.267 --> 43:39.601
Would God forgive us,
Micheletto?

43:41.634 --> 43:43.801
- I know not the ways of God,
My Lord.

43:43.801 --> 43:46.167
- But you know the ways
of silence.

43:48.167 --> 43:52.133
- [Borgia]: And we decree
bullfighting will be permitted

43:52.133 --> 43:56.968
within the walls of Rome
on public festivals

43:56.968 --> 43:59.801
and the last Thursday
of every month.

43:59.801 --> 44:02.133
[Cardinals murmuring]

44:02.133 --> 44:05.968
And, finally,

44:05.968 --> 44:09.667
the main business
to hand.

44:09.667 --> 44:12.801
- Cardinal Della Rovere needs
no staff today, understand?

44:12.801 --> 44:15.934
For a day of meditation,
he has requested peace
and silence.

44:15.934 --> 44:17.934
You can tell the others.

44:20.334 --> 44:22.167
Have you not heard?

44:22.167 --> 44:24.501
His Eminence needs no staff
today.

44:24.501 --> 44:28.734
It is a day of meditation.
- He has much on his mind.
- Too much, some might say.

44:28.734 --> 44:32.834
Such is the burden of great
office. Until tomorrow,
my friend.

44:34.834 --> 44:36.901
- We wish
to announce our decision

44:36.901 --> 44:39.701
to expand the College
of Cardinals,

44:39.701 --> 44:43.534
in view of the crippling
workload placed upon it

44:43.534 --> 44:46.000
by our restructuring

44:46.000 --> 44:49.200
of the affairs
of our Holy Mother Church.

44:51.200 --> 44:55.200
Thirteen new servants of God...
[Cardinals gasping]

44:55.200 --> 44:57.734
...will receive
the cardinal's biretta.

44:57.734 --> 45:00.467
- Thirteen?!
[Angry exclamations]

45:00.467 --> 45:02.200
- We have judged it wise

45:02.200 --> 45:06.968
to strengthen the College
of Cardinals, given the enemies

45:06.968 --> 45:09.467
who have wormed their way
within the Church of Rome.

45:09.467 --> 45:11.467
- This is against all
precedence.

45:11.467 --> 45:14.901
His Holiness will fill
the College with his favourites.

45:14.901 --> 45:19.200
I accuse His Holiness--
- Ohhh! Of what are
we now accused?

45:19.200 --> 45:21.667
- Of an offence
against canon law.

45:21.667 --> 45:25.000
Against the Law
of our Holy Mother Church.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.133
- Canon law?
But we have taken advice

45:29.133 --> 45:33.834
from the most eminent
of all of our canon lawyers.

45:50.834 --> 45:52.667
- Apple...

45:52.667 --> 45:54.968
...or peach?

45:54.968 --> 45:57.701
- Peach, I think.

46:01.868 --> 46:03.534
I like peach.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.968
- Eat it all.

46:10.968 --> 46:15.534
- The Council of Constance is
most clear on this matter.

46:15.534 --> 46:18.234
I refer you to Statute 42,
Paragraph 3--

46:18.234 --> 46:20.100
- In brief, I pray.

46:22.100 --> 46:25.534
- His Holiness, the pope, may
expand the College

46:25.534 --> 46:27.868
to any number
he deems appropriate,

46:27.868 --> 46:30.033
if the burden of work
necessitates--

46:30.033 --> 46:31.701
- I challenge him
to name them now!

46:31.701 --> 46:33.968
- Your Holiness.

46:33.968 --> 46:36.000
- Oh...

46:36.000 --> 46:39.667
 <i>Dottore,</i> if you would be
so kind.

46:39.667 --> 46:44.200
- [Grunting]: And His Holiness
comes behind the Lady Giulia

46:44.200 --> 46:47.934
thus!
- With the force of a stallion.

46:47.934 --> 46:49.634
[Gasping and grunting]

46:51.701 --> 46:53.200
- The Bishop of Lucca,

46:53.200 --> 46:56.868
His Grace Fiorentini, will be
named Cardinal Fiorentini.

46:56.868 --> 47:01.367
The Bishop of Naples,
His Grace Giovanni Mascoli,
will be named Cardinal Mascoli.

47:01.367 --> 47:04.200
The Bishop of Valencia,
His Grace

47:04.200 --> 47:07.667
Cesare Borgia, will be
named Cardinal Borgia.
[Sarcastic laughing]

47:07.667 --> 47:12.067
The pope would make his son
a cardinal?

47:12.067 --> 47:15.701
I warn you, I have evidence
that will bring this house

47:15.701 --> 47:18.934
crashing down around your ears.
- Evidence?

47:18.934 --> 47:24.734
- Of lechery, transgressions,
both public and notorious!

47:24.734 --> 47:26.868
- Why, then, Cardinal,

47:26.868 --> 47:28.601
you must present it.

47:28.601 --> 47:30.767
- I will!

47:30.767 --> 47:32.167
[Spitting]

47:42.767 --> 47:46.901
- The... Bishop of Lyon...

47:46.901 --> 47:48.901
[Gasping and grunting]

47:51.968 --> 47:54.567
- Though whether the Holy Father
is as virile as you...

47:54.567 --> 47:56.334
- Surely he is.

47:56.334 --> 47:58.000
- Only God can tell.

48:03.667 --> 48:06.167
- A candle,
if you please!

48:08.868 --> 48:11.300
Where is everyone?

48:17.968 --> 48:19.968
Is there nobody about?

48:23.901 --> 48:27.133
[Crickets chirping]

48:27.133 --> 48:28.968
- Dear Lord,

48:28.968 --> 48:31.968
I pray for your strength
and guidance

48:31.968 --> 48:34.801
in the trials to come.

48:34.801 --> 48:37.267
Give us some sign

48:37.267 --> 48:39.801
that Rome will be purified,

48:39.801 --> 48:42.667
the Borgia stain will be
banished forever--

48:54.000 --> 48:56.667
Guards! Guards!

48:59.100 --> 49:01.100
Somebody!

49:01.100 --> 49:03.267
Anybody!

49:03.267 --> 49:04.767
Help!

49:27.167 --> 49:30.167
- Was the good cardinal known
for lechery?

49:30.167 --> 49:32.701
- He was discreet
in his affections, My Lord.

49:32.701 --> 49:35.734
So discreet,
indeed,

49:35.734 --> 49:40.467
he asked me to clear the house
of servants yesterday.

49:40.467 --> 49:44.467
- He must have had
lecherous intentions, then.

49:44.467 --> 49:47.934
But I'm... shocked
that they ended in murder.

49:47.934 --> 49:49.934
- And now he's fled,
My Lord.

49:49.934 --> 49:54.901
- I would recommend discretion
in this matter.

49:54.901 --> 49:57.601
The Church of Rome can
ill afford another scandal.

50:00.834 --> 50:04.167
- Perhaps he desired
her silence, My Lord.

50:04.167 --> 50:08.701
- He must have.
Poor girl...

50:08.701 --> 50:11.567
Whom can one trust,
in this Rome of ours?

50:11.567 --> 50:14.667
- I believe trust needs
to be earned, My Lord.

50:14.667 --> 50:16.767
- Perhaps.

50:18.767 --> 50:20.801
And perhaps it has been.

50:28.400 --> 50:31.400
