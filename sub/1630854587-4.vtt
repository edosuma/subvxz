WEBVTT

00:14.000 --> 00:16.208
Sorry, Mr. Lovely is running late.

00:16.291 --> 00:19.416
He likes to appear suddenly
and give me a mini heart attack.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.916
He's so mysterious.
Tell me more about Charles Lovely.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.958
Well, I met him last year at a job fair,

00:26.041 --> 00:28.458
but I feel like I've known him longer,

00:28.541 --> 00:31.875
because he's been appearing
in my nightmares since I was three.

00:31.958 --> 00:33.000
What else? Uh…

00:33.083 --> 00:37.583
It always gets about five degrees colder
when he enters a room.

00:37.666 --> 00:41.416
I've never seen him eat.
I think he feeds on negative emotions.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.583
Oh! This is a funny tidbit.

00:43.666 --> 00:47.375
If you maintain more than five seconds
of eye contact with him,

00:47.458 --> 00:49.416
you'll go insane for a week.

00:49.500 --> 00:53.000
But not necessarily this week.

00:53.083 --> 00:54.083
Hmm?

00:54.166 --> 00:55.583
He's, uh…

00:55.666 --> 00:57.708
-Here.

00:57.791 --> 01:01.500
Good to see you,
Karen Crawford of Paradise.

01:01.583 --> 01:05.416
Blood type O-negative,
born April 2nd, 1969,

01:05.500 --> 01:08.708
shall die June 24, 2042.

01:09.250 --> 01:10.583
Wait, what?

01:10.666 --> 01:14.958
I desire to move my company
to Paradise immediately!

01:15.500 --> 01:16.916
This is the location

01:17.000 --> 01:20.625
where I must construct
Lovely Corp headquarters.

01:21.833 --> 01:25.125
Robby and Delbert's house
is on that land.

01:25.208 --> 01:27.375
Just a heads-up, they can be difficult.

01:27.458 --> 01:29.541
Like, North Florida difficult.

01:29.625 --> 01:32.000
It will not be a problem.

01:32.083 --> 01:33.666
It is settled then.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.666
Paradise is the new home of Lovely Corp.

01:36.750 --> 01:40.708
You just need to sign
a standard basic contract.

01:43.583 --> 01:46.291
It'll take me, like, a month to read this.

01:46.375 --> 01:49.000
Lucky for you,
I like surprises. Where do I sign?

01:49.083 --> 01:49.916
Wait!

01:50.000 --> 01:55.125
Mr. Lovely requires all his contracts
be signed with the blood of a virgin.

01:57.875 --> 02:01.041
This one's fresh
from his YMCA membership agreement.

02:05.708 --> 02:07.541
Don't worry. It won't hurt ya--

02:15.500 --> 02:18.375
And that's how you handle the paper work.

02:18.875 --> 02:22.833
Oh. There's a connect-the-dots
on the place mat.

02:35.916 --> 02:37.333
What'd you tell that Lovely feller

02:37.416 --> 02:39.500
that came around wanting
to buy our house off-camera?

02:39.583 --> 02:43.500
I told that son of a bitch
to floss his teeth with my skinny peter.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.791
It was really funny.
I wish somebody could've seen it.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.583
Anyway. I can't sell this place.

02:47.666 --> 02:50.583
This crack house has been
in my family for generations.

02:50.666 --> 02:52.833
-Two years?
-Yeah, we don't live that long.

02:52.916 --> 02:54.541
What do you want for breakfast, Robby?

02:54.625 --> 02:57.666
Same as every morning.
A crack rock and a Go-Gurt.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.333
We're out of crack, Robby.

02:59.416 --> 03:02.041
Damn it, Delbert! How am I supposed
to know we're out of crack

03:02.125 --> 03:04.625
if you put the empty crack box
back in the cabinet?

03:05.333 --> 03:06.458
Where you going?

03:06.541 --> 03:07.666
Out to buy some crack.

03:07.750 --> 03:10.666
'Cause somebody didn't put it
on the shopping list.

03:16.041 --> 03:17.916
What are you doing out here?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.416
I'm just going outside
to buy some breakfast crack.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.083
Only employees are allowed in the lobby.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.833
What are we gonna do, Robby?

03:27.916 --> 03:31.250
We can't cross the lobby to go buy crack
unless we work for this company.

03:31.333 --> 03:34.291
We about to do the unthinkable, Delbert.

03:34.375 --> 03:35.708
Get jobs.

03:35.791 --> 03:37.958
Is this gonna be
some kind of loony adventure?

03:38.041 --> 03:38.958
I doubt it.

03:41.666 --> 03:43.500
Welcome to Lovely Corp.

03:43.583 --> 03:48.666
Our company has hundreds of divisions
and produces a wide variety of products.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.291
Like the Lovely Phone.

03:51.375 --> 03:53.916
Which are yours for free!

03:54.875 --> 03:57.791
Free samples? Just like Costco!

03:57.875 --> 03:59.583
Too bad I got banned from Costco

03:59.666 --> 04:02.083
'cause I got too excited
and ate a whole tray.

04:02.166 --> 04:03.666
That seems like an overreaction.

04:03.750 --> 04:07.208
Try telling that to Tray's wife.
'Cause she's a single mother now.

04:07.291 --> 04:12.125
Just scroll to the bottom on your phone
and click yes on the user agreement.

04:12.791 --> 04:14.958
-Ow! It cut me!

04:15.041 --> 04:17.125
It's just collecting a little DNA.

04:17.208 --> 04:20.708
You know, I do the same thing
in the bathroom at the Elks Lodge.

04:20.791 --> 04:22.875
I thought Charles Lovely would be here.

04:22.958 --> 04:25.583
Oh, he's here.
He's watching us from that painting.

04:27.291 --> 04:31.416
Mr. Lovely is a big fan
of Scooby-Doo gags.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.666
That's why he makes me wear this.

04:34.791 --> 04:37.791
He has also requested
that you join him for dinner tonight

04:37.875 --> 04:42.291
so he can meet your family,
and you can meet his fiancée.

04:42.375 --> 04:43.708
Tonight? Eugh.

04:43.791 --> 04:47.125
A little late to pull together a family
I'm not embarrassed of, so…

04:47.208 --> 04:48.458
What are you talking about?

04:48.541 --> 04:52.000
I was the life of the party
the last time you had an important event.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.833
Oh, fuck you, Karen.
Your dad would have loved this.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.291
Hey, guys? Feels like that painting
is following me around the room.

05:02.708 --> 05:04.333
This is our shipping department.

05:04.416 --> 05:07.875
We ship any size product
with same-day delivery.

05:07.958 --> 05:09.458
You ship any size?

05:09.541 --> 05:12.166
Looks like somebody just got out
of walking two blocks

05:12.250 --> 05:13.750
back to his apartment.

05:19.833 --> 05:23.666
Goop! They even got free Pirate Booty
in case I get hungry.

05:26.875 --> 05:29.041
Mmm. Mmm.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.708
Tastes bitter for some reason.

05:32.666 --> 05:36.250
This is our Lovely
Virtual Reality department.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.500
Oh, cool! I wanna check that out.

05:39.958 --> 05:44.875
This is Lovely VR,
the most realistic experience imaginable.

05:44.958 --> 05:47.458
It scans your memories
and recreates your world--

05:47.541 --> 05:48.708
Gimme, gimme, gimme!

05:53.708 --> 05:57.083
Hey! That could be dangerous!
It's experimental!

05:57.166 --> 06:00.041
Oh, I stuck my dick
in a warm can of ravioli last night.

06:00.125 --> 06:01.750
I'm not afraid to experiment.

06:01.833 --> 06:03.458
Can you leave now?

06:03.541 --> 06:07.166
Here are your clones we made
from the DNA your phone collected.

06:07.708 --> 06:10.791
Aw. Mine's got my little moustache.

06:10.875 --> 06:13.333
Aw, and your little dick too.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.875
Go fuck yourself, Hopson!

06:14.958 --> 06:16.250
Don't mind if I do.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.583
Why the long face, AFKAK?

06:23.666 --> 06:27.708
I was excited to try Lovely VR
and escape my shitty life,

06:27.791 --> 06:28.750
but they won't let me.

06:28.833 --> 06:31.625
I actually stole one
of those Lovely VR headsets,

06:31.708 --> 06:34.250
and I'll give it to you
if you help us fill out our résumé.

06:34.333 --> 06:35.750
We got stuck on this question.

06:35.833 --> 06:39.291
Name? You guys don't know
how to spell your own names?

06:39.375 --> 06:42.250
Well, I know the alphabet song
my meemaw taught me.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.000
What if I just buy the VR headset?

06:51.083 --> 06:52.916
Okay. $300 sound fair?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.750
Oh, wow! It's so realistic!

06:58.833 --> 07:01.583
Oh, yeah, yeah. Y-You're in the game now.

07:01.666 --> 07:03.166
I-I'm not even real.

07:03.250 --> 07:06.125
Call me VR, 'cause I'm Virtual Robby.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.625
Call me VD, 'cause I got VD.

07:09.125 --> 07:11.416
I'm having dinner
with a billionaire tonight,

07:11.500 --> 07:13.041
so I need to look my best.

07:13.125 --> 07:15.083
Turn around, please.

07:15.166 --> 07:16.833
Stop. Where is it?

07:16.916 --> 07:18.458
-Where's what?
-Your ass.

07:18.541 --> 07:20.291
I thought it looked okay.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.625
Your ass looks like a flyover state.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.333
Flat, poor, and I don't wanna be in it.

07:26.416 --> 07:28.208
Get out of my store, you no-ass freak!

07:29.583 --> 07:32.125
What kinda tailor are you?!

07:34.666 --> 07:37.333
Mean Because My Dad
Didn't Love Me Clothing.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.583
No. We don't carry size XL.

07:39.666 --> 07:43.125
Because we outfit humans,
not whales. Fuck off!

07:45.833 --> 07:48.416
So what do you two bring to the table?

07:48.500 --> 07:49.333
Let's see.

07:49.916 --> 07:53.166
Pills, half a chili dog, some toenails.

07:53.250 --> 07:54.833
I've got a dead Gila monster.

07:54.916 --> 07:58.416
Let's just take a look at your sad résumé.

07:58.500 --> 08:02.958
Oh. Says here you each have
a master's from Cal Fullerton.

08:03.041 --> 08:06.416
No. We have a master <i>named</i> Cal Fullerton.

08:06.500 --> 08:09.833
He's a dominatrix who comes to our house
and makes us do S&M stuff.

08:09.916 --> 08:11.375
Yeah, Cal's scary, man.

08:11.458 --> 08:14.958
He makes me load up my piss hole
with Redenbacher corn kernels

08:15.041 --> 08:17.708
and heats up my sack
with a blowtorch till it pops.

08:17.791 --> 08:19.875
Then I run around ejaculating popcorn

08:19.958 --> 08:21.833
while Delbert tries
to catch them in his mouth.

08:21.916 --> 08:23.208
Cal calls that one "movie night."

08:23.291 --> 08:25.333
I don't know
why we keep inviting him over.

08:25.416 --> 08:29.166
To be honest,
I've never seen two worse applicants.

08:29.250 --> 08:32.333
You have no experience, no education,

08:32.416 --> 08:35.416
and you have several open sores
on your faces.

08:35.500 --> 08:39.666
But you're both white men,
so you're obviously hired.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.458
Ah! Commentary.

08:45.041 --> 08:48.791
Thank you for agreeing
to come down and ID your son's body.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.541
I know this isn't easy.

08:53.666 --> 08:56.541
I told Cal Fullerton
he was getting too rough.

08:59.583 --> 09:03.750
Hey, Mort. I need an outfit for a shindig.
You got this shirt in an XL?

09:03.833 --> 09:05.666
Check the bottom left drawer.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.166
Score! Free belt too.

09:11.250 --> 09:14.000
Here's your son. Sorry about the mix-up.

09:14.083 --> 09:14.916
That's him.

09:15.541 --> 09:18.083
I guess my grandchildren
will grow up without a father.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.000
Whoa! Nice jeans!

09:21.833 --> 09:24.458
Look how good his ass looks.

09:24.541 --> 09:27.041
You know what?
These jeans are important evidence.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.500
Uh… I used to be a cop.

09:29.208 --> 09:31.958
This is insane!
I'm not gonna let you desecrate--

09:33.125 --> 09:36.666
Wow! Your ass looks great in those.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.291
Now my son's not the only one
who's getting stiff.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.583
Is this drain just for blood,
or can I wring my panties out in it?

10:01.500 --> 10:03.125
This VR is incredible.

10:03.208 --> 10:06.166
I can do whatever I want,
and there are no consequences.

10:06.250 --> 10:09.541
Eleven items in the express lane!
I'm so bad.

10:09.625 --> 10:10.708
Sir, you can't do that.

10:10.791 --> 10:12.291
Can I do <i>this</i>?

10:14.625 --> 10:16.541
Yoink.

10:16.625 --> 10:17.958
This game is fun!

10:29.000 --> 10:30.083
This is bullshit.

10:30.166 --> 10:34.458
How they gone call this a male room,
and there ain't no sexy hot males in here?

10:34.541 --> 10:36.708
Holy shit. A 90-inch TV.

10:39.666 --> 10:40.750
Hey, get rid of that.

10:41.875 --> 10:48.416
"Ship to Robby in the lobby."

10:51.166 --> 10:53.916
Phew! Man, I'm bushed.
That was a hard day's work.

10:54.583 --> 10:56.250
Hey, Robby. I wonder what this is for.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.166
Oh, I know exactly what it's for.

11:02.625 --> 11:03.958
Turn it off! Turn it off!

11:08.708 --> 11:12.375
Are you the one that stuck his tallywacker
into the pneumatic vacuum?

11:13.416 --> 11:14.458
No.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.291
Don't be modest!

11:16.375 --> 11:18.833
That's what I call a power move.

11:18.916 --> 11:21.958
Richard Branson
starts every day like that.

11:22.041 --> 11:24.750
You two are getting a huge promotion!

11:24.833 --> 11:26.875
You're giving them a promotion for that?

11:26.958 --> 11:29.333
I've been with this company for ten years!

11:29.416 --> 11:31.541
And not once in those ten years

11:31.625 --> 11:34.791
have you thought
to put your dick up the tube.

11:46.791 --> 11:49.208
Randall!
Can you help feed the baby?

11:49.291 --> 11:50.500
Hell no, Karen.

11:50.583 --> 11:53.125
I ain't gonna mess up
my new Jordache jeans.

11:53.208 --> 11:56.708
What do you mean, "Hell no"?
I should kick your--

12:00.958 --> 12:04.583
Ass! Big, juicy ass!

12:04.666 --> 12:08.458
Hey. Don't touch me, Karen.
These jeans are perfect and dick-tight.

12:08.541 --> 12:11.083
If I get a boner,
I'll stretch out the front and ruin 'em.

12:11.166 --> 12:15.625
I don't care how you got that ass,
but it is beggin' for a peggin'.

12:18.708 --> 12:20.541
Well, you ruined this for me.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.166
I'm just gonna watch TV.

12:23.416 --> 12:27.291
No! Ever since I was a little kid,
Count Chocula has given me boners!

12:27.375 --> 12:30.166
How are we supposed to keep track
of what gives you a boner?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.541
Well, I made you a list.

12:32.875 --> 12:35.125
One, all breakfast cereal mascots.

12:35.208 --> 12:37.500
Two, Mexican Pizza from Taco Bell.

12:37.583 --> 12:39.333
Three, dogs dressed as fish.

12:39.416 --> 12:42.250
Four, Lou Ferrigno in full Hulk makeup.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.375
Ugh. This is fucking stupid.

12:45.416 --> 12:48.958
Gingers calling me stupid.
That's number 72!

13:07.500 --> 13:10.208
The kick is good! Swish!

13:10.291 --> 13:12.250
Kevin! You did this?!

13:12.333 --> 13:15.041
I thought Don Jr. was trying
to get his dad's attention again.

13:15.125 --> 13:17.583
None of this is real. Not even you.

13:17.666 --> 13:20.625
It wouldn't matter
if I killed you too, or-- or did this.

13:23.541 --> 13:24.875
What the fuck?!

13:24.958 --> 13:26.708
How did you not get any on him?

13:27.625 --> 13:29.125
It's all a game. See?

13:33.125 --> 13:36.291
This is good VR. E-Even the pain is real.

13:36.375 --> 13:37.833
This ain't a game, you maniac!

13:37.916 --> 13:40.208
You're wearing a damn snorkel mask!

13:40.291 --> 13:43.166
What? You mean I--
I really killed those people?

13:43.250 --> 13:44.708
And wood-chipped the baby?

13:44.791 --> 13:47.583
A-And pulled out
the poor old lady's boobies?

13:47.666 --> 13:49.833
And jerked off my cousin Pierre.

13:49.916 --> 13:50.833
Sorry, Pierre.

13:50.916 --> 13:53.333
It is cool. I am European.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.250
A hand job is how we say <i>bonjour</i>.

13:58.958 --> 14:04.916
Oh! Oh! Ron Perlman
finally get his 90-inch TV.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.333
If they shipped me fat man
by mistake, me club him to death.

14:14.458 --> 14:15.958
Hey.

14:16.041 --> 14:19.083
This definitely real TV.

14:19.166 --> 14:23.250
Unga bunga! This thing heavy!

14:26.458 --> 14:29.083
Let's see what on news.

14:29.166 --> 14:31.666
Hello. This is CNNN
with some breaking news.

14:31.750 --> 14:33.041
I'm Connie Chung.

14:33.125 --> 14:36.500
You know, it just came in
that watching TV can be deadly

14:36.583 --> 14:39.208
to ugly sumbitches with protruding brows,

14:39.291 --> 14:42.291
significant underbites,
and close-set eyes.

14:42.375 --> 14:47.000
If you match that description,
go to another room so the TV can escape.

14:47.083 --> 14:51.208
Oh. Good thing Ron Perlman
handsome Hollywood actor,

14:51.291 --> 14:55.333
so Ron stay here and watch TV all day.

14:55.416 --> 14:56.666
Fuck.

14:56.750 --> 15:00.833
Unga bunga. Let's see what on NBC.

15:00.916 --> 15:05.833
He-hey!
It's me, Bill Cosby, with <i>The Cosby Show</i>.

15:05.916 --> 15:07.250
Jism, blasm.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.375
I'm a rapist, but you see,

15:09.458 --> 15:12.708
but you don't know that yet,
'cause this is the reruns.

15:12.791 --> 15:14.333
Blasm, jisms, uh…

15:14.416 --> 15:16.791
Oh. TV look a little off.

15:16.875 --> 15:20.958
Perlman better adjust contrast. Oh! Oh!

15:31.000 --> 15:32.458
What's wrong with the boss?

15:32.541 --> 15:35.250
Ah, he's been like that since somebody
stole his magic Jordache jeans

15:35.333 --> 15:36.666
that made his booty pop.

15:36.750 --> 15:39.000
He's really insecure about his ass.

15:39.083 --> 15:40.666
Boss, cheer up.

15:40.750 --> 15:41.833
Cheer up?

15:41.916 --> 15:45.708
The only reason I got the respect
of the five families

15:45.791 --> 15:48.708
was my thick dumpster-truck ass.

15:48.791 --> 15:53.666
But without my Jordache jeans,
I got a butt like a skinny white girl.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.291
You know what they're gonna do

15:55.375 --> 15:58.291
when they see
that I ain't got no junk in the trunk?

15:58.375 --> 16:00.333
That I ain't got no sugar lumps?

16:00.416 --> 16:02.458
That I ain't got gaba-glutes?

16:03.041 --> 16:04.416
They're gonna tease me.

16:04.916 --> 16:07.333
Sir, we have a dress code.

16:08.416 --> 16:10.875
Can I offer you some house pants?

16:10.958 --> 16:12.041
Listen, you little prick!

16:12.125 --> 16:15.125
I'm not wearing any pants
till I find my Jordache jeans!

16:16.625 --> 16:17.750
Boss, look!

16:19.166 --> 16:21.291
My Jordache jeans! Grab him!

16:22.291 --> 16:23.791
Hey!

16:25.083 --> 16:27.708
Yous got one chance
to get outta here alive.

16:27.791 --> 16:29.750
Give me those pants right now.

16:29.833 --> 16:31.625
Hold on, hold on. Let me think.

16:31.708 --> 16:33.125
Hmm… Fuck off.

16:33.208 --> 16:34.791
Let me shoot him, boss.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.291
No! You might hit the pants!

16:36.375 --> 16:37.833
Then I'll cut his throat.

16:37.916 --> 16:42.291
And have his blood drip down
all over my pants? Use your fucking head!

16:42.375 --> 16:43.416
Let's choke him.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.916
I don't know, boss. Every time
I get choked, I shit my pants.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.333
What if we gas him?

16:48.416 --> 16:50.375
Eesh. I don't know about that.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.708
Every time I get gassed, I shit my pants.

16:52.791 --> 16:54.208
My fucking dentist hates me.

16:54.291 --> 16:56.208
Looks like you guys can't touch me.

16:56.291 --> 16:59.875
Even if I said something
like your boss has a flat ass.

16:59.958 --> 17:01.208
Oh!

17:01.291 --> 17:05.291
His ass is so flat,
Kyrie Irving thinks it's the Earth.

17:05.375 --> 17:07.083
Oh!

17:07.166 --> 17:11.083
His ass is so flat,
Matt Gaetz might ask him for nudes.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.833
Oh!

17:36.958 --> 17:40.041
Happy birthday!

17:40.125 --> 17:43.541
Uh, yes, is this the estate
of "Macho Man" Randy Savage?

17:43.625 --> 17:44.583
Oh, nice. Okay.

17:44.666 --> 17:47.166
I'm the Head of Acquisitions
here at Lovely Corp.

17:47.250 --> 17:50.958
I want to acquire the bones
of Mr. "Macho Man" Randy Savage.

17:51.041 --> 17:54.958
Why? Because we gonna do a little
unholy ceremony to reanimate his body.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.125
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.166
Yes, I'm high on cocaine. Why?

17:58.250 --> 18:00.875
Can I go with y'all?
I feel like I'm a misfit too.

18:00.958 --> 18:02.708
Delbert, who the hell are you talking to?

18:02.791 --> 18:05.000
Rudolph, Hermey the Dentist, and…

18:05.083 --> 18:06.958
Shit. They were just here.

18:09.041 --> 18:11.791
Let's see what on guide.

18:14.041 --> 18:17.375
Me check out History Channel.

18:17.458 --> 18:21.625
Oh shit. Hey, I'm historical figure
named… Adolf Hitler.

18:21.708 --> 18:23.375
I invented mac and cheese,

18:23.458 --> 18:26.000
and I went to the Moon,
and I wrote the Bible.

18:26.083 --> 18:30.333
Which my son, Abraham Lincoln,
well, he was a Japanese ice-road trucker

18:30.416 --> 18:32.958
that wrote the movie <i>Porky's Revenge!</i>

18:33.041 --> 18:36.250
Who say TV not educational?

18:37.500 --> 18:41.208
Oh! Oh! Oh!
<i>Sons of Anarchy</i> on! Unga bunga!

18:42.416 --> 18:44.000
Vroom! Vroom!

18:44.083 --> 18:48.500
I'm Ron Perlman.
I'm a big, caveman-looking sumbitch.

18:48.583 --> 18:51.166
Unga bunga! I like motorcycles!

18:51.250 --> 18:53.375
The writing was so good.

18:57.958 --> 19:01.333
Karen, you ain't gonna believe this one.
These mobsters wanted my pants.

19:01.416 --> 19:05.666
I said, "Hey, I'm willing to die
for these pants, and so is my family."

19:06.583 --> 19:07.625
Karen?

19:07.708 --> 19:09.500
Don't fuck around. Come on out.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.875
Oh, you know hide-and-seek
is number five on my boner list.

19:14.416 --> 19:16.333
<i>We have your wife and baby.</i>

19:16.416 --> 19:19.875
<i>Bring the Jordache jeans,</i>
<i>or your family's dead.</i>

19:19.958 --> 19:22.875
<i>Yours truly, Bobby Bubblebutt.</i>

19:26.666 --> 19:29.416
Will you let me hide here
from Cal Fullerton?

19:29.500 --> 19:33.708
If I die one more time this week,
they're gonna cancel my Medicaid.

19:37.375 --> 19:40.625
We find the defendant
AFKAK Pubesalad Crawford

19:40.708 --> 19:44.750
guilty of the charges of arson,
robbery, serial genocide,

19:44.833 --> 19:48.958
dildo-based elder abuse,
and forcibly kissing 25 dogs.

19:49.041 --> 19:50.708
And stealing one's heart.

19:50.791 --> 19:53.625
It's not my fault.
I thought it was a game.

19:53.708 --> 19:54.541
Silence!

19:54.625 --> 19:57.958
I sentence you to death
by electric, lethal gas,

19:58.041 --> 20:01.541
injection, and firing squad,
while hanging.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.250
And that's the game. Pretty fun, right?

20:26.333 --> 20:31.291
How the hell have you two managed
to spend $50 million in three hours?!

20:31.375 --> 20:32.708
Cocaine's expensive.

20:32.791 --> 20:35.750
We didn't spend a single dollar
without doing a fuck-us group.

20:35.833 --> 20:37.750
It's a focus group.

20:37.833 --> 20:39.666
No, I'm pretty sure it's a fuck-us group,

20:39.750 --> 20:41.958
'cause we brought in a group,
and they fucked us.

20:42.041 --> 20:45.708
I'm starting to think making you VPs
and giving you stock options

20:45.791 --> 20:48.875
because you stuck your dick
up a tube was a bad idea.

20:48.958 --> 20:51.625
Not a single one
of your investments had returns.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.875
One of them returned. From the dead.

20:55.291 --> 20:59.875
Oh yeah.
It's the "Macho Skele-Man" Randy Savage.

20:59.958 --> 21:04.750
That atomic elbow was almost
as strong as the dark magic

21:04.833 --> 21:07.458
that brought me back to life!

21:07.541 --> 21:08.833
Oh yeah!

21:10.916 --> 21:16.750
Can't believe Perlman be watching
Skinemax four hours straight.

21:17.375 --> 21:20.083
Perlman love TV.

21:20.625 --> 21:24.875
Everything but scary movies.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.583
Oh. What wrong with TV?

21:29.666 --> 21:34.041
Perlman can't change channel!

21:34.125 --> 21:39.208
Ooh! Look at me!
I'm that scary sumbitch from <i>The Ring</i>.

21:40.708 --> 21:44.000
I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya good!

21:46.041 --> 21:48.833
Please don't kill Perlman!

21:49.458 --> 21:52.625
Me do anything!

21:52.708 --> 21:56.125
Crawl your little ass in that TV frame
and entertain me for a change.

21:56.208 --> 21:58.583
Now, I wanna watch <i>Hellboy</i>.

21:58.666 --> 22:01.250
Me Ron Perlman. Oh! Oh!

22:01.333 --> 22:06.125
Me-- me big, caveman-looking
son of bitch. Unga bunga!

22:06.208 --> 22:09.750
Me like motorcycles. Vroom. Vroom.

22:09.833 --> 22:12.708
Whoo! That Ron Perlman's
got a lot of range.

22:16.041 --> 22:17.875
I'm here for my family.

22:17.958 --> 22:19.458
You bring my jeans?

22:20.125 --> 22:22.583
Send them over,
and I'll toss you the jeans.

22:26.583 --> 22:29.000
Come to Daddy!

22:29.083 --> 22:30.666
Hey, hey. How's my ass?

22:34.250 --> 22:35.458
Eesh.

22:35.541 --> 22:37.166
I hate to tell you this, boss,

22:37.250 --> 22:40.375
but it's flatter
than Ron Perlman's frontal cortex.

22:42.875 --> 22:45.000
Are you waiting for a Ron Perlman cutaway

22:45.083 --> 22:47.458
where he goes, "Unga bunga,"
and gets all pissed?

22:47.541 --> 22:50.750
Well, he ain't watching.
There was a hilarious mix-up with his TV.

22:50.833 --> 22:53.500
Aw, great!
That was the best part of the script!

22:53.583 --> 22:55.250
Whatever.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.583
-Boss, your ass is flat.
-What?!

22:57.666 --> 23:00.666
Those are Dollar Tree jeans!

23:01.208 --> 23:04.125
You'll never get my pants!

23:05.125 --> 23:09.500
If I can't have those jeans, nobody can,
you apple-bottomed dickhead!

23:12.875 --> 23:14.333
Run! Go, go, go!

23:17.166 --> 23:20.125
Ha ha! I got my family back and escaped

23:20.208 --> 23:22.875
without getting a scratch
on my magic jeans.

23:22.958 --> 23:24.416
This is a great-- Uh-oh.

23:34.625 --> 23:37.166
Aw, I just came in my pants.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.416
That's the last straw, motherfucker.

23:40.500 --> 23:44.750
Ten months undercover as a pair of pants
to take down Mafia don, Bobby Bubblebutt,

23:44.833 --> 23:48.250
and not only do you ruin it,
you came on the back of my head!

23:48.333 --> 23:51.500
Clappers? They let you back into the FBI?

23:51.583 --> 23:55.208
That's really your first question?
Not how the fuck are you pants?

23:57.291 --> 24:00.000
Since that motherfucker Thester
slashed our cocaine budget,

24:00.083 --> 24:02.750
I can't think of no more
good business ideas no more.

24:02.833 --> 24:08.083
In a recession, it's beneficial
to buy something that's recession-proof.

24:08.166 --> 24:09.291
Oh yeah.

24:09.375 --> 24:12.583
You a damn undead skeleton.
You don't know shit about business.

24:12.666 --> 24:14.291
Why you so stressed out, Robby?

24:14.375 --> 24:17.000
You know what?
I know why I'm so stressed out.

24:17.083 --> 24:20.875
Because we lost track of why
we took this job in the first place.

24:20.958 --> 24:21.916
To buy crack.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.166
You're right, Robby.

24:23.250 --> 24:26.041
We did so much cocaine,
we almost forgot who we are.

24:26.125 --> 24:27.416
We're crackheads.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.208
Let's make it right, Delbert.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.458
We quit!

24:34.916 --> 24:38.000
Good morning, Mr. Crack Dealer, sir.
We would like to buy some crack.

24:38.083 --> 24:40.375
I'm sorry. I sold it all to that guy.

24:40.458 --> 24:43.833
Crack rock is recession-proof. Oh yeah.

24:43.916 --> 24:47.208
I guess I do know about business, uh-huh.

24:47.291 --> 24:51.958
Because I'm the new VP
of Acquisitions. Oh yeah.

24:52.541 --> 24:56.000
You two sumbitches
ready for movie night?

24:56.083 --> 24:58.000
Oh shit! It's Cal Fullerton!

24:58.875 --> 25:00.166
Let us back in!

25:01.666 --> 25:05.791
I'm so happy that your whole family
could make it to dinner.

25:06.375 --> 25:10.208
I am so happy
you brought your tiny mortal.

25:10.291 --> 25:12.250
He is very attractive.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.958
He's a goddamn BILF, that's what he is.

25:15.041 --> 25:20.291
I hear it is customary
to give these strange beings a gift.

25:20.375 --> 25:24.750
I present you this Snuggle Me Lovely Doll.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.083
<i>I love you. You love me.</i>

25:30.166 --> 25:32.958
<i>Time is a meaningless construct.</i>

25:33.041 --> 25:34.875
<i>We are already dead.</i>

25:34.958 --> 25:39.416
Now, I'd like for you to meet my fiancée.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.166
Gina?!

25:43.250 --> 25:45.541
I hope I'm not too late, honey.

25:48.083 --> 25:51.125
Wow. That is the biggest surprise
of this episode.

25:51.666 --> 25:55.583
Oh really? Did you forget
that I was pants, motherfucker?
