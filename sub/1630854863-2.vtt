18:31.400 --> 18:34.599
Who in his head is wanting one
percent of this shitty club?

18:34.599 --> 18:37.039
Feels like he's
speaking Chinese to me.

18:37.039 --> 18:41.079
Fucking turn over this, gross,
net this, interest points.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.799
I don't want no minimum, Sam.

18:42.799 --> 18:44.279
I just want my money.

18:44.279 --> 18:46.759
Thursdays, same always.
Okay?

18:49.519 --> 18:50.519
[Nasa] I'll tell you
this Mark Markovic,

18:50.519 --> 18:52.680
fucking stupid.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.920
There's car out the front?

18:59.519 --> 19:01.079
Johnny, it's good
to see you back.

19:03.519 --> 19:05.240
You do good tonight, hmm?

19:07.160 --> 19:09.119
Tomorrow you can do
special job for me?

19:10.279 --> 19:11.119
Sure, whatever you need.

19:14.720 --> 19:18.400
Okay good, here we go.

19:19.640 --> 19:20.720
[John] I think you've
misunderstood

19:20.720 --> 19:22.359
what Mark was actually saying.

19:22.359 --> 19:24.599
You know, $2,000 is a minimum,

19:24.599 --> 19:25.839
plus there's an
additional 10 percent

19:25.839 --> 19:27.680
which means there's a
lot of money to be made.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.400
I think it's an opportunity
you should think about.

19:31.039 --> 19:35.160
You see, he already think
like businessman.

19:35.160 --> 19:38.319
Johnny it's interesting,
I think about this, okay?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.839
Tomorrow, we can fix
'the laugh'.

19:41.839 --> 19:43.599
You take care of those boys?

19:43.599 --> 19:44.759
You can do this,
no problem?

19:46.839 --> 19:47.680
Sure.

19:49.640 --> 19:50.759
You're good.

19:50.759 --> 19:52.559
Take this.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.400
Call this number,

19:54.400 --> 19:56.039
he tell you where to go.

19:56.039 --> 19:57.079
You do good tonight.

20:09.839 --> 20:12.400
[suspenseful music]

20:12.400 --> 20:15.039
[Nasa] What you do, huh?

20:15.039 --> 20:17.759
You forget to open door for me?

20:23.279 --> 20:26.240
[John] Hey, tell me if you
think this is a crazy idea.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.559
[man] What?

20:28.680 --> 20:31.480
I'm thinking about
buying this place.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.680
What, The Tunnel?

20:32.680 --> 20:36.319
[laughs] Brother,
you're fucking crazy.

20:36.319 --> 20:40.079
Well when you own a business,
no one can be your boss.

20:40.079 --> 20:42.359
We'd be our own bosses.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.319
Yeah, but how?

20:45.359 --> 20:46.240
I'll figure it out.

20:47.279 --> 20:49.359
Apparently this place
is going to shit.

20:49.359 --> 20:51.000
Well then why would you buy
a place that's going to shit?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.200
'Cause the only way
it can go, is up.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.000
Are you fucking serious?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.039
Oh, you do think he's crazy?

21:02.039 --> 21:02.839
No, no, I mean you're
John Ibrahim.

21:02.839 --> 21:05.519
You're a fucking champion.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.119
Do it.

21:12.119 --> 21:13.440
Watch me.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.920
Well go on then.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.039
I will.

21:16.039 --> 21:17.559
Walk away,
you're on my premises.

21:17.559 --> 21:18.880
- Nah.
- Excuse me! Keep walking mate.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.880
Excuse me.
I've had enough.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.480
[upbeat dance music]

21:32.440 --> 21:34.200
[knock bangs]

21:34.200 --> 21:34.319
Brooke!

21:36.960 --> 21:39.960
[suspenseful music]

22:04.319 --> 22:05.799
[spoon clangs]

22:13.920 --> 22:17.640
[crowd mutters indistinctly]

22:31.519 --> 22:33.000
[door bangs]

22:38.039 --> 22:41.480
[men mutter indistinctly]

22:45.559 --> 22:49.160
[muffled yelling]

22:49.160 --> 22:51.400
You said next week,
last week, huh?

22:51.400 --> 22:52.599
What do you want me to do?

22:55.160 --> 22:56.759
It's three weeks plus.

22:56.759 --> 22:58.119
That's seven grand, Mark.

22:59.759 --> 23:02.400
It's my daughter,
she painted it for me,

23:02.400 --> 23:03.920
on her fucking birthday.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.319
She's got muscular dystrophy.

23:06.319 --> 23:07.720
[painting glass shatters]

23:07.960 --> 23:09.640
[Mark] I'll get you the money!

23:10.319 --> 23:12.440
Like I promise. I promise.

23:12.440 --> 23:13.720
I'll get you the money.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.319
Oh fuck!

23:15.319 --> 23:17.079
You got till
four o'clock tomorrow.

23:17.079 --> 23:18.200
It's your final warning.

23:21.480 --> 23:24.240
[suspenseful music]

23:29.519 --> 23:31.160
[gun clicks]

23:46.599 --> 23:49.519
[car tires crunch]

23:51.759 --> 23:54.079
[Crellan] Here he is.

23:54.079 --> 23:56.039
What, you hit the fucking
big time now, Johnny hey?

23:57.359 --> 23:58.680
All right, listen up.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.160
You're going to
have to tell Nasa

24:00.160 --> 24:02.119
that we need to raid
Club 77 on Tuesday.

24:02.119 --> 24:05.079
This new Chief Super's
got a crab up his arse

24:05.079 --> 24:06.440
and he needs charges.

24:06.839 --> 24:07.880
Why 77?

24:07.880 --> 24:09.759
Well, fucking why not 77?

24:09.759 --> 24:10.960
It's been long enough.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.160
It's 50 bucks, it's a
write up and Ashtray's

24:13.160 --> 24:13.960
out of the weeds
for another six months.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.119
He can fucking afford it.

24:16.119 --> 24:17.960
[John] Yeah, I'll let him know.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.759
How's the stomach holding up?

24:20.759 --> 24:21.599
It's all right.

24:21.599 --> 24:24.039
Gutsy effort, mate. [laughs]

24:24.039 --> 24:25.119
[John] There is one other thing.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.599
Any chance you could run
a number plate for me?

24:29.599 --> 24:33.599
[dramatic music]

24:33.599 --> 24:34.960
Also, there's this guy, Markovic.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.920
He's the licensee
of The Tunnel.

24:37.920 --> 24:38.839
Do you know him?

24:38.839 --> 24:40.400
Yeah, I know who he is.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.279
Any chance you could run
a check on him as well?

24:43.279 --> 24:44.200
Looking for what?

24:45.880 --> 24:46.960
Anything.

24:47.720 --> 24:48.680
Why?

24:50.000 --> 24:52.400
I'd consider it
a personal favour.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.119
[laughs]

24:58.440 --> 25:00.359
Don't worry about
any of that for now.

25:00.359 --> 25:01.839
Let me see what
I can dig up first.

25:01.839 --> 25:03.200
[John] Appreciate it.

25:04.319 --> 25:06.519
[Mooney] Anything else,
your highness?

25:12.960 --> 25:15.039
[upbeat dance music]

25:20.440 --> 25:22.079
[man] Shift your arse
over this way!

25:24.039 --> 25:26.359
[door slams]

25:30.160 --> 25:31.039
Shit!

25:31.039 --> 25:32.119
Hey guys, a little help!

25:34.359 --> 25:36.079
Shit!

25:39.920 --> 25:42.200
[horn honks]

25:50.279 --> 25:51.799
Hey Darren.

25:51.799 --> 25:53.799
Just here to pick up my suit.

25:54.279 --> 25:55.480
- Will that cover me?
- Yeah, no problem.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.759
Thanks mate.

25:59.119 --> 26:00.799
[Crellan] Hey, you mind giving
us a couple of minutes?

26:06.079 --> 26:08.920
Details of the owner
of your truck.

26:08.920 --> 26:10.759
Taiwanese mob out of Haymarket.

26:10.759 --> 26:12.720
They run ciggies and grog
off the books,

26:12.720 --> 26:14.319
and I don't want
to deal with them.

26:14.319 --> 26:15.880
That's all I needed, thanks.

26:15.880 --> 26:16.960
And then nothing of any note

26:16.960 --> 26:18.000
on your man Markovic,

26:18.000 --> 26:19.920
other than he likes
to spend money.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.079
He's not the owner of the club.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.160
He just manages the joint.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.359
He's the licensee.

26:23.359 --> 26:25.440
The owner is a
bloke in Queensland.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.480
His name is Mr. Cirillo Elias.

26:27.480 --> 26:28.720
He's got three of them.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.359
The other one is in
Brisbane and in Melbourne.

26:30.359 --> 26:32.759
He's a pretty straight shooter
and no form to speak of.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.759
All the address and phone
numbers are in there.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.240
What do I owe you?

26:36.240 --> 26:38.680
Oh, this one's on the house.

26:38.680 --> 26:39.680
Thanks mate!

26:39.680 --> 26:40.720
[Darren] Okay, see you!

26:41.160 --> 26:42.559
Just wait a couple minutes
before you leave, all right?

26:46.319 --> 26:50.200
[suspenseful music]

27:10.160 --> 27:11.559
[John] You're paying for
five guys front of house

27:11.559 --> 27:13.200
but you're only
really getting two.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.039
The rest of that money's
going to Nasa Kalouri.

27:15.039 --> 27:17.839
Now I can change that overnight.

27:17.839 --> 27:18.880
You've also got three
of you staff

27:18.880 --> 27:20.000
dealing cocaine
over the bar.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.519
Now one visit from
the drug squad

27:21.519 --> 27:22.480
you're going to
lose your licence.

27:22.480 --> 27:25.000
But I can put a stop
to that too.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.640
And Mark here's got
all your alcohol coming

27:26.640 --> 27:28.240
out of Haymarket off-license.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.039
He's getting a kickback, but
it's illegal and it's risky.

27:30.039 --> 27:33.480
You let me use my guys
out of Bankstown.

27:33.480 --> 27:34.880
Now they're wholesale,
they're legit.

27:34.880 --> 27:35.920
It's the same price

27:36.440 --> 27:38.480
but all that profit is going
into the club, not his pocket.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.279
Now security,

27:40.279 --> 27:41.680
these are all my guys.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.559
They're handpicked,
vetted by me personally.

27:43.559 --> 27:45.480
Plus you get Sam and
his crew on the street.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.000
All the spruikers,
the guys on the door,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.240
all of that I oversee myself.

27:49.240 --> 27:51.519
Now you give me
alcohol and security,

27:51.519 --> 27:55.319
I stop the dealing and you
are out of debt in 10 months.

27:55.319 --> 27:57.039
No risk, and you can
forget about Nasa Kalouri.

27:57.039 --> 27:59.240
Nasa is a personal
friend of mine.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.240
I can guarantee that.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.480
Hmmm.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.960
And this figure here?

28:03.960 --> 28:05.480
Well that's your gap.

28:05.480 --> 28:06.720
That includes the
last four weeks.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.240
I'm personally prepared
the front Mark today

28:08.240 --> 28:09.799
to square things with Nasa.

28:09.799 --> 28:11.440
What are you going to do,
rob a bank?

28:11.440 --> 28:13.160
You cut me in at 20 percent,

28:13.160 --> 28:16.240
and Mark can stay on as
licensee until I learn the ropes,

28:16.240 --> 28:17.519
but then I take over as manager.

28:17.920 --> 28:21.359
You can stay in Queensland.

28:21.359 --> 28:24.039
Spend time with your family,
whatever you like.

28:25.119 --> 28:26.319
And in 12 months

28:26.319 --> 28:27.759
I guarantee I will have
this club in profit.

28:27.759 --> 28:30.559
We can re-discuss terms then.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.880
But I come in at 20 percent,
that makes me the owner.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.519
That bit is non-negotiable.

28:40.279 --> 28:42.119
Mark, go take a walk, would
you?

28:49.480 --> 28:52.480
Listen John,

28:52.480 --> 28:54.519
not anyone can just come in
here and run a club like this.

28:54.519 --> 28:55.920
You know?

28:55.920 --> 28:59.319
And we both know
how much 20 percent

28:59.319 --> 29:01.519
of this business is
actually worth, yeah?

29:04.000 --> 29:05.440
Today,

29:06.039 --> 29:06.759
right now,

29:07.559 --> 29:11.519
with your debt and Sam's boys
ready to come in and collect,

29:13.480 --> 29:14.960
it's worthless.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.160
It's worth $280,000.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.079
I can offer you,

29:26.119 --> 29:27.960
$84,000...

29:30.440 --> 29:34.200
...362 dollars.

29:34.599 --> 29:35.759
Right now.

29:35.759 --> 29:38.000
That's everything I've
ever earned in my life.

29:48.759 --> 29:50.400
All right.

29:50.400 --> 29:51.839
We got a deal.

29:56.079 --> 29:57.720
I need a drink.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.440
You want something?

29:59.440 --> 30:00.799
Just a water, thanks.

30:25.599 --> 30:28.599
[sirens wail]

30:47.799 --> 30:51.039
John, it's Brad, your mate.

30:51.039 --> 30:53.000
He's OD'ed,
We found him in the skip bin.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.880
What was he...

31:00.960 --> 31:01.920
Was he sleeping in it?

31:01.920 --> 31:02.799
What the fuck's
he doing in the bin?

31:02.799 --> 31:04.119
Mate, I don't know for certain.

31:04.119 --> 31:05.920
It sounds like George found
him on the fire escape

31:05.920 --> 31:07.160
and then had his boys toss him.

31:07.160 --> 31:08.640
Probably didn't want the
hassle with the jacks.

31:10.319 --> 31:12.559
[dramatic music]

31:16.240 --> 31:19.319
[Brooke yells]

31:19.319 --> 31:22.039
[Brooke] How fucking could you?

31:22.039 --> 31:23.160
Piss off!

31:24.880 --> 31:27.400
[punches slam]

31:38.640 --> 31:40.119
[men grunt]

31:43.519 --> 31:45.160
Okay, get his legs.

31:48.599 --> 31:50.400
[body crashes]

31:52.319 --> 31:53.319
Piece of shit.

32:00.799 --> 32:02.279
Ah, fuck him.

32:04.119 --> 32:06.400
[Ezra] Ah, for fucks sake, really?

32:06.960 --> 32:07.839
Yeah, yeah.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.200
Yeah.

32:11.319 --> 32:12.759
Yeah, thanks.

32:12.759 --> 32:14.519
Never fucking believe it.

32:14.519 --> 32:17.400
Terry Fields has just gone and
had a fucking brain aneurysm.

32:18.599 --> 32:19.680
What do you mean?

32:19.680 --> 32:22.000
I mean, he's dead.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.720
Oh,

32:25.359 --> 32:27.119
that cunt.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.599
I know. The amount of time

32:29.599 --> 32:31.839
and fucking energy you've
put into these things.

32:31.839 --> 32:33.400
It's fucking ridiculous.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.000
Oh, honey.

32:41.319 --> 32:43.519
We can find another
Terry Fields.

32:45.039 --> 32:46.640
Better him than you.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.519
Yeah, I know.

32:55.359 --> 32:56.119
It's just us Senator.

32:56.119 --> 32:58.880
So you know, speak your mind.

33:00.519 --> 33:03.119
Would it be out of line
if I would ask a favour?

33:03.119 --> 33:04.440
No.

33:04.839 --> 33:06.480
What do you have in mind?

33:08.160 --> 33:09.839
Well it...

33:11.559 --> 33:12.880
...it's my daughter.

33:12.880 --> 33:17.599
She's with this
bloke and he's...

33:19.759 --> 33:20.680
Well, he's been bashing her.

33:20.680 --> 33:23.119
He's got her on the drugs.

33:23.119 --> 33:24.200
[Ezra] Oh.

33:24.559 --> 33:27.240
I tried talking to her,
but she won't listen to me.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.680
Ah-ha.

33:28.680 --> 33:30.480
But I want to get rid of him,

33:30.480 --> 33:31.359
but not you know,

33:31.359 --> 33:33.880
not forever, just warn him off.

33:34.839 --> 33:37.200
Okay, all right.

33:41.160 --> 33:42.599
Yeah, okay.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.759
There is something that
you could do for me.

33:49.759 --> 33:52.359
I mean, I dunno how
you feel about it,

33:52.359 --> 33:54.000
but this new guy

33:54.000 --> 33:55.559
that took over from Terry...

33:55.559 --> 33:56.559
Bill Allen.

33:56.559 --> 34:00.160
Be great to meet him.

34:00.160 --> 34:02.519
Terry was saying that
there was some talking

34:02.519 --> 34:03.759
at Macquarie Street,

34:03.759 --> 34:06.480
this new Independent...

34:06.480 --> 34:07.680
Barry Hess.

34:07.680 --> 34:09.079
Yeah, that's the one.

34:09.079 --> 34:10.360
Is this something you...?

34:12.280 --> 34:13.599
Ahh, meeting with Bill?

34:13.599 --> 34:15.480
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.679
Nice, thank you.

34:17.679 --> 34:20.518
All right, cheers Paul.

34:26.518 --> 34:28.518
[Ezra] I think I'll keep you
off this one.

34:28.518 --> 34:29.559
Fair enough.

34:29.559 --> 34:31.599
Sam, what's his face?

34:31.599 --> 34:32.480
Abraham?

34:34.280 --> 34:35.039
Ibrahim.

34:35.039 --> 34:36.159
Yeah, yeah, that's the one.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.119
Right.

34:40.599 --> 34:42.639
I'll tell you what,

34:42.639 --> 34:44.320

34:55.000 --> 34:56.920
Hey, listen.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.039
What if I come pick you up
after your shift tonight?

35:03.960 --> 35:04.719
Mol?

35:05.639 --> 35:06.840
[Molly on the phone]
Sorry, my...

35:06.840 --> 35:09.199
Oh, come on, it's Friday night.

35:09.199 --> 35:10.400
A girl like you
shouldn't be alone.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.320
[Molly] Sure.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.360
Okay, but look,
I've got to go John.

35:14.360 --> 35:15.599
Yeah, yeah, no that's fine.

35:15.599 --> 35:16.480
I'll see you.

35:22.039 --> 35:22.079

35:27.239 --> 35:28.239
Congratulations.

35:29.639 --> 35:30.440
Thanks.

35:34.079 --> 35:34.119

35:36.119 --> 35:37.400
What do you need?

35:38.800 --> 35:40.159
Angelo Lombardi.

35:41.559 --> 35:42.880
You remember him?

35:43.679 --> 35:45.400
Boss has called in the favour.

35:47.039 --> 35:49.239
A couple of hours work
later tonight, that's all.

35:50.559 --> 35:54.719
I'd say it's in your best
interest, if you said yes.

35:57.039 --> 35:59.519
[suspenseful music]

36:32.639 --> 36:34.159
I won't need it.

36:35.079 --> 36:36.119

From fuckin' Ashley?

38:55.320 --> 38:56.679

38:56.679 --> 38:58.840
Could you turn that thing down?
I can't hear myself.

38:58.840 --> 38:59.800
What's going on John?

38:59.800 --> 39:01.519
You are a jack, aren't you?

He's okay.

39:25.079 --> 39:28.440
[group yells]

39:28.440 --> 39:30.679
[John] Will you fucking

You too, you think
you could sit down.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.440
Get fucked!

40:00.559 --> 40:02.239
All right, so look,
this chick Ash,

40:02.239 --> 40:03.320
she says you got
violent with her.

40:03.320 --> 40:04.079
You broke her jaw.

40:06.039 --> 40:08.199
Don't deny Spyro,
I fucking know you.

40:08.199 --> 40:09.000
You can't do that anymore, okay?

40:11.400 --> 40:12.400
She's scared.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.119
So, I need you to
stop bashing her,

40:14.119 --> 40:15.480
and I need her car.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.039
Did Ashley put you up to this?

40:18.039 --> 40:18.920
No she didn't put me up to it.

40:19.199 --> 40:19.960
It's not important
who put me up to it.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.400
It's important to me who did.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.320
What are you fucking her?

40:23.000 --> 40:23.880
I don't fucking know her.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.400
You are fucking her,
aren't you?

40:25.400 --> 40:26.400
Man, I'm not fucking
going anywhere

40:26.400 --> 40:27.519
until I get some
kind of guarantee

40:27.519 --> 40:28.440
you're not going to
bash Ashley anymore.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.880
And I need her car back.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.000
So could you just fucking agree
to that so I can leave?

40:31.000 --> 40:32.800
This is doing
my fucking head in.

42:49.719 --> 42:50.760
There's no neighbours here, mate.

42:51.159 --> 42:52.599
It's like living on fucking
Mars, it's a shit hole.

43:03.719 --> 43:06.039
All right, this bloke's
gone for this one first.

43:06.880 --> 43:08.920
There's been a bit of a
scuffle, an exchange of fire.

43:08.920 --> 43:12.480
Big fella's squeezed
off two himself,

43:12.480 --> 43:14.760
during which the little
one has managed a headshot

43:14.760 --> 43:16.320
killing the big guy.

43:16.320 --> 43:18.480
And then the little one's
expired over there.

43:18.480 --> 43:19.480
Anything else you want to add?

43:19.480 --> 43:20.719
Tiger snake.

43:20.719 --> 43:22.719
And the tiger snake.

43:22.719 --> 43:23.400
All right,
chuck your shooters there.

43:23.400 --> 43:24.960
I got it from here.

43:27.360 --> 43:27.400
All right.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.000
So, I'd take it home.

43:44.000 --> 43:44.840
Bring it around the house
in the morning.

43:44.840 --> 43:45.719
Burn your clothes, everything.

You good to drive?

44:01.639 --> 44:02.000

45:02.280 --> 45:04.960
Yeah, I wasn't,
I'm just sitting.

45:13.679 --> 45:15.159
So Warren,

45:15.840 --> 45:18.559
why you parked in
a no standing zone?

45:18.559 --> 45:20.719
Just eating a pie and
listening to some footy.

45:22.920 --> 45:24.719
Just give me that pen there, please.

45:36.119 --> 45:37.440
So Warren,

45:38.800 --> 45:39.800
I reckon you had dinner
somewhere else.

45:39.800 --> 45:40.719
What do you think?

45:41.599 --> 45:44.719
Yeah, yeah definitely.

45:45.559 --> 45:46.679
Went home for tea tonight,
just me...

45:46.679 --> 45:48.519
You and the misses?

45:48.519 --> 45:51.760

Yeah, my dogs as well.

45:52.679 --> 45:55.199
Yeah mate, good man.
