Excuse me, Mr. Alvarez?

02:48.580 --> 02:50.120
-Oh, hi, Nia.
-Hi.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.880
I wanted to talk to you
about my science test.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.580
Yeah, that was a tough one
to hand back.

02:54.580 --> 02:56.620
-I wish you'd kept it.
-(laughs)

02:57.620 --> 02:59.000
I've just had a really
hard time

02:59.000 --> 03:00.750
with this genetics section
for some reason.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.120
Oh, Nia, I know
it can be
intimidating,

03:03.120 --> 03:05.170
but science
is just asking
a question

03:05.170 --> 03:07.120
and then performing
an experiment
to answer it.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.250
It's all about the results.
There's no right or wrong.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.500
Well, in that case,

03:10.500 --> 03:12.790
would it be wrong for you
to change this "D" to an "A"?

03:12.790 --> 03:14.460
(laughs)

03:14.460 --> 03:15.790
Very wrong,
actually.

03:15.790 --> 03:17.250
I could
get fired.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.670
No, I-I didn't mean--

03:19.670 --> 03:21.790
you know what? Good talk.

03:21.790 --> 03:23.460
Listen,

03:23.460 --> 03:25.460
if you want to write
an essay on genetics,

03:25.460 --> 03:26.750
you know, do
an experiment

03:26.750 --> 03:28.080
about
characteristics
in your family,

03:28.080 --> 03:29.330
I could give
you some
extra credit.

03:29.330 --> 03:30.540
Seriously?

03:30.540 --> 03:31.830
Thank you so much, Mr. Alvarez.

03:31.830 --> 03:33.210
I really appreciate it.

03:33.210 --> 03:34.920
Hey, it's the least
I can do.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.000
(chuckles)

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
It's all
I can do,
really.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.500
I'm a middle
school science
teacher, Nia,

03:39.500 --> 03:40.960
I don't have
much power.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.330
How about this?

03:49.330 --> 03:51.580
We'll switch out Levi's
regular soap with joke soap

03:51.580 --> 03:52.960
and turn
his whole body green.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.460
That's not an experiment,
that's a prank.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.080
It'd be funny though.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.170
Hey, check this out.

04:01.170 --> 04:03.830
"Genetic similarities
and differences in twins."

04:03.830 --> 04:05.040
That's perfect!

04:05.040 --> 04:07.080
You could write something
about you and Booker.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.790
I have kind of wondered...

04:08.790 --> 04:10.330
If Booker and I are twins,

04:10.330 --> 04:12.120
how come he's psychic
and I'm not?

04:12.120 --> 04:13.670
What makes him so special?

04:13.670 --> 04:15.670
Maybe he's not special.

04:15.670 --> 04:17.880
Maybe you have powers too,

04:17.880 --> 04:19.790
but he just did something
to make it work.

04:19.790 --> 04:21.080
That's it!

04:21.080 --> 04:22.540
That'll be my experiment.

04:22.540 --> 04:25.380
I'll see if I have
the same genetic power
as my twin brother!

04:25.380 --> 04:27.040
Man, you wanna be like Booker?

04:27.040 --> 04:28.500
This "D" really messed you up.

04:33.170 --> 04:34.830
Look, Chels!

04:34.830 --> 04:36.290
One last stick,

04:36.290 --> 04:38.500
then I'm finished
with Booker's project!

04:38.500 --> 04:39.620
You know,
I thought you and Booker

04:39.620 --> 04:41.670
were going to work
on that project together.

04:41.670 --> 04:43.460
So did I.

04:45.670 --> 04:47.000
Levi, do you see it?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.290
No, but he's got to
be in here somewhere.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.170
Just don't tell my mom.
She'll kill us.

04:51.170 --> 04:53.620
-(loud) Why would I kill ya?
-No reason!

04:53.620 --> 04:55.920
There's go to be a reason.
There's always a reason.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.210
What's the reason?

04:57.210 --> 04:58.420
Really, Mom, it's nothing.

04:58.420 --> 05:00.080
Oh, Rae, they're lying!

05:00.080 --> 05:01.750
There's a snake on the light!

05:01.750 --> 05:04.500
-(hissing)
-(screaming)

05:06.380 --> 05:08.170
Quick, we need something
to catch him in!

05:08.170 --> 05:10.120
(Raven whimpering)

05:11.120 --> 05:12.960
-Hurry!
-Where'd he go?

05:12.960 --> 05:14.670
(snake hissing)

05:14.670 --> 05:16.080
(high-pitched scream)

05:16.080 --> 05:17.330
Snake on the foot!

05:17.330 --> 05:19.710
(screaming)

05:19.710 --> 05:21.750
Careful,
you're gonna scare him!

05:21.750 --> 05:23.290
Scare him? He's a snake.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.500
He's made of fear.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.880
He got away.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.670
-He's over there!
-(Raven screams)

05:29.670 --> 05:31.710
-I got him!
-Wait! No, wait!

05:34.080 --> 05:35.620
I got him.

05:35.620 --> 05:37.670
Quick, Levi, bring me
something to put him in.

05:41.710 --> 05:43.790
Here we go. Good boy.

05:45.710 --> 05:48.750
Whew! Now, that was close.

05:48.750 --> 05:52.330
That... could have been
a real disaster.

05:52.330 --> 05:54.080
(crunches)

05:55.790 --> 05:57.330
Get up.

05:57.330 --> 05:59.210
Get up! Get up!

05:59.210 --> 06:00.540
Get up!

06:00.540 --> 06:01.960
Look what you did.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.750
I worked all day on this.

06:04.750 --> 06:06.960
Oh, Mom, you didn't
have to do that.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.580
I changed my project.

06:08.580 --> 06:10.710
I'm writing a paper now.

06:11.710 --> 06:13.920
-I'm gonna kill him.
-No, no, no!

06:13.920 --> 06:15.620
No, no, no.
Rae, Rae, Rae.

06:15.620 --> 06:17.750
Look. Look around, boys.

06:17.750 --> 06:18.830
Look what you did.

06:18.830 --> 06:19.920
Yeah.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.580
Listen, we have been
working all day.

06:21.580 --> 06:24.210
We've been doing your laundry,
cleaning up after you.

06:24.210 --> 06:25.710
I built a bridge for you

06:25.710 --> 06:27.830
that you were supposed
to help me with.

06:27.830 --> 06:29.960
You have no appreciation
for anything.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.960
Listen, both of you,
go to your room.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.080
-But we really--
-No "buts"!

06:34.080 --> 06:35.540
Go to your room.

06:41.790 --> 06:44.170
Listen, Rae,
if it makes you feel
any better,

06:44.170 --> 06:46.000
that bridge wasn't really
your best work.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.880
Wow, I've never seen my mom
that mad before.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.580
I have,
in the grocery store.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.620
But, in my mom's defense,

06:59.620 --> 07:01.330
that lady had over 15 items.

07:02.750 --> 07:05.380
I can't believe they think
we don't appreciate them.

07:05.380 --> 07:07.750
We appreciate them.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.790
Well, we don't tell them
or show them,

07:09.790 --> 07:11.460
but, tshh, they know.

07:12.580 --> 07:15.040
I don't think they do.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.790
Maybe we should do something,

07:16.790 --> 07:18.540
you know, to really
show them that we care.

07:18.540 --> 07:20.080
Yeah.

07:20.080 --> 07:23.080
Get on the computer
and search for
"what moms like."

07:23.080 --> 07:24.290
(keys clacking)

07:25.580 --> 07:27.000
All that's coming up
is pictures

07:27.000 --> 07:29.790
of scented candles
and firemen.

07:29.790 --> 07:31.540
Well,
search to see

07:31.540 --> 07:33.420
if anything fun
is happening
in town.

07:35.170 --> 07:37.500
Food truck festival,

07:37.500 --> 07:38.960
book fair,

07:38.960 --> 07:42.250
some band called La Dee Da
playing in Old Town tonight.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.580
La Dee Da?

07:43.580 --> 07:45.620
Isn't that the band they were
listening to this morning?

07:45.620 --> 07:46.960
Honestly, I can't keep up

07:46.960 --> 07:50.000
with what the grown-ups
are into these days.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.500
Yeah,

07:51.500 --> 07:53.210
Mom and Aunt Chels
love that band.

07:53.210 --> 07:54.790
We should buy them tickets.

07:54.790 --> 07:56.790
I've got some leftover cash
from my birthday.

07:56.790 --> 07:57.750
What about you?

07:57.750 --> 07:59.500
I do have a little
Tooth Fairy money

07:59.500 --> 08:01.040
burning a hole
in my pocket

08:01.040 --> 08:02.790
This is perfect!

08:04.460 --> 08:06.170
Only one problem.

08:06.170 --> 08:07.920
We don't have a credit card.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.380
Tshh, don't worry.
I know someone who does,

08:11.380 --> 08:14.920
and they've bought
their way out of trouble
with my mom lots of times.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.290
Thanks, Dad!

08:17.380 --> 08:19.540
You're the best.
We'll send you the cash...

08:19.540 --> 08:21.620
(laughs)
unless you want me
to keep it.

08:21.620 --> 08:22.750
(laughs)

08:22.750 --> 08:24.880
(seriously)
I'll put it in
an envelope tomorrow.

08:30.460 --> 08:31.750
Hello, Mom.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.420
Hello, Auntie Rae.

08:33.420 --> 08:35.330
You both look lovely.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.500
(whispers)
Jump in. I'm terrible
at small talk.

08:39.830 --> 08:42.000
Here, this is for you.

08:43.290 --> 08:46.380
You got this flower
from the vase on my dresser.

08:46.380 --> 08:48.540
You can't give me
something I already own.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.500
We just
wanted to apologize

08:51.500 --> 08:53.290
for messing everything
up earlier.

08:53.290 --> 08:56.380
You were right.
We haven't been
appreciative.

08:56.380 --> 08:58.170
But that all ends now.

08:58.170 --> 09:01.540
Today is officially
"Mom Appreciation Day".

09:01.540 --> 09:03.420
Yeah, they're saying
all the right words,

09:03.420 --> 09:05.170
but something
doesn't feel right.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.500
We have a surprise for you.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.960
We wanna take you out,

09:09.960 --> 09:13.210
but you can't go
dressed like-- like that.

09:13.210 --> 09:15.460
You just said
we look lovely.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.120
Sorry, I was just trying
to warm up the room.

09:20.620 --> 09:21.750
Well, I don't know
how I feel, because,

09:21.750 --> 09:23.880
you know,
I've been cleaning up

09:23.880 --> 09:25.620
all day,

09:25.620 --> 09:28.120
and I think
I just wanna chill,

09:28.120 --> 09:30.710
-light a scented candle...
-Ooh.

09:30.710 --> 09:32.920
...look at pictures
of firemen.

09:35.830 --> 09:37.330
No, no, no, no.
Trust me,

09:37.330 --> 09:39.000
you're gonna love
what we have planned.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.830
Okay, okay, well,
how do I do my hair?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.830
Do I do it
like Saturday night,

09:42.830 --> 09:45.000
-or Sunday morning?
-Hey!

09:45.000 --> 09:47.670
Just bring both wigs
and you can decide
when you get there.

09:53.540 --> 09:54.790
So, how's it going?

09:54.790 --> 09:56.880
Well, there's a lot of stuff
under here,

09:56.880 --> 09:59.080
and something snarled at me.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.960
But, I found it.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.170
This was the shirt
Booker was wearing

10:02.170 --> 10:04.040
the day he got
his very first vision.

10:05.580 --> 10:06.830
Ugh.

10:06.830 --> 10:08.620
It's like wearing
one of Booker's feet.

10:09.620 --> 10:11.710
Are you sure you really
want to do this?

10:11.710 --> 10:13.330
Yes, I have to.

10:13.330 --> 10:14.710
It's my experiment.

10:14.710 --> 10:15.920
I'm gonna do things
just like Booker

10:15.920 --> 10:17.830
and see if any of it
triggers my power.

10:17.830 --> 10:20.830
That shirt's triggering
my gag reflex.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.880
Okay, now I have to get
into Booker's mindset.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.120
How you gonna do that?

10:26.120 --> 10:28.500
Well, by doing what he does
every single day.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.250
I'm gonna say something
I think is cool and then
not make a basket.

10:32.960 --> 10:33.960
Grab an umbrella,

10:33.960 --> 10:36.460
'cause the Splashmaster
General's about to
make it rain!

10:37.500 --> 10:38.920
What does that mean?

10:38.920 --> 10:41.330
It doesn't matter.
He just turns his brain off
and then talks.

10:44.790 --> 10:47.000
Huh. Probably just luck.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.790
It's cupcake time!

10:50.330 --> 10:51.880
I thought you were
supposed to miss.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.460
I'm trying.

10:53.460 --> 10:56.250
Thanks for visiting
Mount Swishington!

10:56.250 --> 10:58.580
Now we're playin'
donkey ball!

10:58.580 --> 11:00.920
Upload that to Hoopstagram!

11:00.920 --> 11:03.540
We're bakin' maskets!

11:04.960 --> 11:07.620
Man, how does Booker
not make these things?

11:07.620 --> 11:08.880
I think I know.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.500
He stinks at basketball!

11:18.460 --> 11:20.960
Oh, boys,
this better be worth it.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.330
You had us walk
three blocks blindfolded.

11:23.330 --> 11:25.380
It was only supposed
to be one block,

11:25.380 --> 11:27.880
but we went
the wrong way.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.250
Okay, you can look now.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.750
Oh, great.

11:30.750 --> 11:31.880
Oh...

11:31.880 --> 11:33.080
(gasps)

11:33.080 --> 11:34.540
Rae, look who it is!

11:34.540 --> 11:36.620
No way! No way! No way!

11:36.620 --> 11:39.830
Surprise!

11:39.830 --> 11:42.620
It's your favorite girl group
of all time, La Dee Da!

11:42.620 --> 11:44.210
(screaming)

11:44.210 --> 11:45.960
-We bought you tickets.
-What?

11:45.960 --> 11:47.750
-Oh, my goodness.
-I can't believe it.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.080
This is amazing!

11:49.080 --> 11:51.250
So, does this mean
you're not mad at us?

11:51.250 --> 11:53.080
How can we be mad
at the boys

11:53.080 --> 11:55.380
that got us
La Dee Da tickets?

11:55.380 --> 11:57.380
I don't think we're ever
gonna be mad at you again.

11:57.380 --> 11:58.540
Well...

11:59.580 --> 12:01.040
It worked better
than we thought.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.500
This concert
fixed everything.

12:06.330 --> 12:08.500
I know this is gonna
break your hearts,

12:08.500 --> 12:10.540
but the concert is canceled.

12:10.540 --> 12:11.920
(audience clamors)

12:15.210 --> 12:18.000
Come on, Rae,
let's go elbow our way
to the front, all right?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.040
You clear a path,
I'm gonna carry the drinks.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.790
Yeah!

12:21.790 --> 12:24.120
Um, actually, we're gonna
hang back a sec and go
to the bathroom.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.670
-But I don't have to go
to the bathroom.
-Yeah, you do.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.750
Okay, well,
y'all stick together

12:29.750 --> 12:31.040
and, uh, wash your hands.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.460
Yeah!

12:32.460 --> 12:34.170
Both of them.

12:34.170 --> 12:37.080
La Dee Da, here we come!

12:38.170 --> 12:39.500
What's going on?

12:39.500 --> 12:41.960
I had a vision
that the concert's
gonna get canceled.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.250
It can't get canceled.

12:43.250 --> 12:46.670
It's the only reason
our moms love us again.

12:46.670 --> 12:48.290
I know.

12:48.290 --> 12:50.170
We need to sneak backstage

12:50.170 --> 12:52.710
and tell La Dee Da
how much our moms
need this show!

12:52.710 --> 12:54.080
-Come on!
-Wait!

12:54.080 --> 12:57.040
Now I actually do
have to go to the bathroom.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.210
(humming tune)

13:02.210 --> 13:03.080
All right ladies,

13:03.080 --> 13:05.710
there are 2,000 screaming
fans out there

13:05.710 --> 13:08.920
waiting for La Dee Da
to give them the show
of their lives.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.460
And our fans
are the reason
we're here,

13:10.460 --> 13:12.920
'cause we don't get paid
until after the meet-and-greet.

13:14.170 --> 13:16.790
Now, come on, Dee, door.
Da, makeup kit.

13:25.830 --> 13:27.880
What was that thud?

13:27.880 --> 13:30.120
I think
I found the thud.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.380
That's Da!

13:33.380 --> 13:35.210
She's in
the band!

13:35.210 --> 13:36.670
The show's
about to start.

13:36.670 --> 13:38.250
She can't go on like this.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.580
Levi,

13:39.580 --> 13:41.880
I think we're the reason
the show gets canceled.

13:46.580 --> 13:48.250
-Excuse us!
-Excuse me!

13:48.250 --> 13:49.670
Excuse me!
Excuse us!

13:49.670 --> 13:51.500
That's cute.
Do that later.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.830
Excuse me!
Excuse us!

13:52.830 --> 13:54.960
(singsongy)
Oh, yeah, burned you.

13:54.960 --> 13:56.790
(both screaming)

13:56.790 --> 13:58.580
Front row!

13:58.580 --> 14:00.170
This is amazing!

14:00.170 --> 14:02.580
Selfie!

14:02.580 --> 14:04.210
You're so cute!

14:04.210 --> 14:05.040
(laughing)

14:05.040 --> 14:07.120
-Oh, wow. Chels?
-What?

14:07.120 --> 14:09.120
What would you do
if La Dee Da

14:09.120 --> 14:11.210
saw us dancing perfectly,

14:11.210 --> 14:12.790
and asked us to perform
on stage with them?

14:12.790 --> 14:14.960
I would throw up, Rae!

14:14.960 --> 14:16.540
I would literally
throw up.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.670
Oh, those boys are so sweet
for getting us tickets.

14:20.670 --> 14:22.920
I know, I can't believe
how long they've been
in the bathroom.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.330
Yeah, we should go
check on them.

14:28.120 --> 14:31.080
We're in so much trouble.
We never should have
come backstage.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.080
Ugh! We can't take
them anywhere!

14:38.170 --> 14:39.460
I knew this was
too good to be true.

14:39.460 --> 14:41.790
What? What's too good
to be true?

14:41.790 --> 14:44.040
I just saw the boys
getting in trouble backstage.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.420
What?

14:45.420 --> 14:46.830
We're returning them, Rae,

14:46.830 --> 14:49.000
I don't know where,
but we're gonna return 'em.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.120
We are.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.250
Excuse us!
Coming through.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.960
We'll be back, though.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.250
-Anything yet?
-No.

14:59.250 --> 15:03.250
Not a vision,
or a weird feeling?
Nothing?

15:03.250 --> 15:04.750
Wait.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.540
Wait, I'm seeing something.

15:06.540 --> 15:09.790
That stack of books
on the desk is gonna fall...

15:09.790 --> 15:12.170
right now!

15:12.170 --> 15:13.620
Okay.

15:14.790 --> 15:16.710
Right... now!

15:18.710 --> 15:20.580
You were right!

15:21.750 --> 15:23.080
It didn't work.

15:24.330 --> 15:26.210
None of this stuff worked.

15:26.210 --> 15:28.500
So what if Booker
has visions and you don't?

15:28.500 --> 15:30.210
Why does it matter?

15:30.210 --> 15:32.500
He's my twin brother, Tess,

15:32.500 --> 15:35.580
and he has this amazing power
that makes him special.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.880
I guess I'm just not
special like that.

15:43.330 --> 15:45.920
-Is she okay?
-I think so.

15:45.920 --> 15:48.210
Yeah, I can feel
her breath.

15:48.210 --> 15:50.170
I can smell it, too.

15:50.170 --> 15:52.120
Got to get you some gum
when you wake up.

15:53.790 --> 15:55.250
This is bad!

15:55.250 --> 15:56.790
La:
Da, are you ready?

15:56.790 --> 15:59.040
Someone's coming. There.

16:00.540 --> 16:02.580
(humming tune)

16:02.580 --> 16:04.330
Oh! Da, you asleep?

16:07.210 --> 16:09.210
Well, are you gonna
get dressed?

16:11.250 --> 16:13.330
Are you giving me
the silent treatment?

16:13.330 --> 16:15.830
Is this because
I've been secretly dating
your ex-boyfriend?

16:19.210 --> 16:21.290
I should fire you for that,

16:21.290 --> 16:22.960
but I actually
respect you for it.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.880
Hurry up and get dressed.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.170
We are on in five!

16:28.210 --> 16:30.170
-What was that thud?
-I don't know.

16:30.170 --> 16:33.000
(gasps)
I think we found
the thud! What?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.120
Oh, my goodness, it's Dee!

16:35.120 --> 16:36.250
Hey, Ma.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.250
Booker, what are
you doing here?

16:38.250 --> 16:41.120
We just wanted to make sure
you guys had a great night,

16:41.120 --> 16:43.540
to show you how much
we really appreciate you.

16:45.330 --> 16:47.290
But we're
in so much trouble.

16:47.290 --> 16:49.290
We never should have
come backstage.

16:49.290 --> 16:50.960
We ruined everything.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.580
Oh, my head.

16:52.580 --> 16:53.620
She's waking up!

16:53.620 --> 16:55.620
Hey, Ms. Da,
we're super sorry,

16:55.620 --> 16:57.750
but you need
to get up on that stage.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.250
I don't think I can.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.080
Me neither. Ah.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.000
Rae, this is awful.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.790
They can't have
a La Dee Da concert
without...

17:05.790 --> 17:07.170
Dee and Da.

17:07.170 --> 17:09.290
No, you can't.

17:09.290 --> 17:11.250
Un-- unless you can.

17:15.290 --> 17:18.380
(audience cheering)

17:23.380 --> 17:25.620
(loud cheering)

17:25.620 --> 17:27.580
Where are those girls?

17:30.580 --> 17:33.460
Rae! We're in La Dee Da.

17:33.460 --> 17:35.580
I know, Chels.
Don't throw up!

17:37.120 --> 17:38.710

thank you.

Did you hear that crowd, Rae?
They were cheering for us!

18:54.420 --> 18:56.250
Ooh, I don't know
if that's true,

18:56.250 --> 18:57.580
but I'm gonna
pretend it is.

18:57.580 --> 18:59.000
Me, too.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.830
I don't care if we're
banned from this theater
for life,

19:00.830 --> 19:02.790
you guys were amazing
out there!

19:02.790 --> 19:04.790
-Thank you.
-Everyone was so impressed,

19:04.790 --> 19:07.750
they promised
not to press charges.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.170
Yeah.

19:09.170 --> 19:11.250
Tonight was
so much fun,
you guys,

19:11.250 --> 19:13.420
but you know you don't have
to do something huge like that

19:13.420 --> 19:14.670
just to show us you care.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.670
But you do
so much for us.

19:16.670 --> 19:17.830
Yeah,

19:17.830 --> 19:19.920
and all we do
is drive you crazy.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.670
You do,
you really do, but...

19:22.880 --> 19:24.540
I'm gonna tell you
a little secret:

19:24.540 --> 19:26.830
I drove my parents
crazy, too.

19:26.830 --> 19:30.040
Yeah, Grandma told me.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.540
You know, if you really
want to make us feel
appreciated,

19:32.540 --> 19:34.460
you could do little things,

19:34.460 --> 19:36.710
like wash the dishes,
without having to be asked.

19:36.710 --> 19:39.960
Oh, yes,
or you could fold
the laundry.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.290
Or just say...

19:42.290 --> 19:43.460
"thank you."

19:44.830 --> 19:46.250
We can do that.

19:49.540 --> 19:50.880
Oh, now.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.330
You want us
to say it now?

19:52.330 --> 19:53.540
Yes.

19:54.540 --> 19:55.960
Thank you.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.080
Yeah, thank you.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.500
Switch!

20:02.500 --> 20:04.670
-Come here!
-Oh, I love you boys.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.460
Whoo! Hey, Chels?

20:07.460 --> 20:08.920
-What?
-Tonight was lit.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.580
-Yeah, it was!
-(laughing)

20:11.580 --> 20:12.710
Come on,
let's go to the car.

20:12.710 --> 20:14.250
Wait, you have to show us
where the car is.

20:14.250 --> 20:15.670
You walked us here
blindfolded.

20:15.670 --> 20:17.580
Oh, yeah,
it's this way.

20:17.580 --> 20:19.710
-So much fun!
-I wanna do it again.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.000
-Next week.
-Yeah.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.000
No, no,
it's definitely
this way.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.500
Nia, I just finished reading
your extra credit paper.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.460
Look, I know
it wasn't very good.

20:38.460 --> 20:40.250
I didn't prove anything.

20:40.250 --> 20:41.960
Also, I might have spelled
my name wrong.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.620
Sometimes my computer
auto-corrects it to "Narnia."

20:44.620 --> 20:47.120
No, Nia,

20:47.120 --> 20:49.460
this paper was exceptional!

20:49.460 --> 20:50.790
And the further
research you did

20:50.790 --> 20:53.420
to explain why you have
genetic differences
from your brother?

20:53.420 --> 20:55.620
That was very,
very impressive.

20:55.620 --> 20:57.080
Really?

20:57.080 --> 20:58.880
I helped. Just in case
you wanna throw

20:58.880 --> 21:01.380
a few of those extra credits
my way, Mr. Alvarez.

21:01.380 --> 21:03.670
Ah, ha, ha, ha.

21:03.670 --> 21:05.540
I'm concerned about
your peer group.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.290
Don't worry, she's harmless.

21:09.290 --> 21:10.380
Mostly.

21:11.580 --> 21:12.540
I think you were
having trouble

21:12.540 --> 21:14.620
connecting
to the material
in class,

21:14.620 --> 21:16.290
but you did that
in here.

21:16.290 --> 21:18.880
You showed a real grasp
of the scientific method.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.670
That's not even taught
until ninth grade.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.000
So, I get the extra credit?

21:22.000 --> 21:25.330
This paper will bring
your score up to a "B."

21:25.330 --> 21:27.250
But, I have
one more request:

21:27.250 --> 21:29.790
I want you to check out
one of my honors
science classes.

21:29.790 --> 21:31.670
Oh, no,
no, no, no.

21:31.670 --> 21:35.120
If I did that,
they'd have to invent
an even lower grade for me.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.540
When's the last time
you handed out a "Z"?

21:37.540 --> 21:40.330
I think you'd do really,
really well.

21:40.330 --> 21:42.330
You have
a scientific mind.

21:42.330 --> 21:44.290
You just need to learn
to unlock it.

21:46.290 --> 21:47.620
I'll think about it.

21:47.620 --> 21:49.540
Listen, you may not
have the "hoop skills"

21:49.540 --> 21:51.540
that you wrote about
your brother having,

21:51.540 --> 21:53.620
but that paper
was a slam dunk.

21:53.620 --> 21:55.670
(laughs)

21:55.670 --> 21:57.750
Don't tell
the other students
how funny I am.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.750
I need them to fear me.

22:02.500 --> 22:06.170
You used "hoop skills"
instead of "psychic powers"
on your paper?

22:06.170 --> 22:08.750
I didn't want Mr. Alvarez
to know Booker's secret.

22:08.750 --> 22:10.250
I'm just glad he bought it.

22:10.250 --> 22:12.500
If he ever sees Booker
on that basketball court,

22:12.500 --> 22:13.710
he'll know I was lying.

22:13.710 --> 22:15.210
Come on, let's go.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.290
Something weird
happened at that concert.

22:19.290 --> 22:22.580
A lot of weird things
happened at that concert.

22:22.580 --> 22:24.250
I know.

22:24.250 --> 22:27.540
I mean, my vision of La
canceling her show
didn't come true.

22:27.540 --> 22:30.380
That's never
happened
before.

22:30.380 --> 22:32.960
Maybe I can stop bad things
from happening.

22:34.380 --> 22:36.670
Levi, what are you doing?

22:36.670 --> 22:38.710
Kenneth isn't in his cage.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.830
Together: Oh, no!

22:42.830 --> 22:45.580
Kenneth, Kenneth,
you leave me alone!

22:45.580 --> 22:47.250
(hissing)

22:47.250 --> 22:49.460
Snakes can't climb.
I am so happy.

22:49.460 --> 22:51.120
Oh, he's climbing!

22:51.120 --> 22:53.710
He's climbing,
he's climbing.
Chels!

22:53.710 --> 22:56.120
He's climbing!
The snake is climbing!
