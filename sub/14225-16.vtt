WEBVTT

00:04.129 --> 00:06.330
The pressure is on for
young Tiffany.

00:06.365 --> 00:08.340
Will she crack?

00:08.375 --> 00:10.459
Will the tower crack?

00:10.494 --> 00:13.734
During swimming, will we
see Jorge's butt crack?

00:15.057 --> 00:17.357
Don't make me laugh.

00:17.392 --> 00:19.493
Nice job, Tiff-dog!

00:19.528 --> 00:20.810
Now there's no way
you'll beat me.

00:20.845 --> 00:22.554
Mail call, Wood-chumps!

00:22.589 --> 00:23.805
Aah!

00:25.709 --> 00:29.394
We'll just call it a tie.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.771
In case you're wondering, I
did go through all your mail.

00:31.807 --> 00:33.207
And it's as boring as you are!

00:35.703 --> 00:36.985
Hey, that's a federal offense.

00:37.020 --> 00:39.312
And offensive!

00:39.348 --> 00:42.874
Ooh! My collectible
<i>Hunter Hayes</i> mug!

00:42.910 --> 00:45.744
His shirt comes off when you
pour hot liquid into it.

00:45.780 --> 00:48.872
He's literally
too hot to handle.

00:48.908 --> 00:50.388
Which is what the handle says.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.528
(GASPS) OMG!

00:54.563 --> 00:56.438
My friend Jasmine
wrote me a letter!

00:56.473 --> 00:58.165
Where are the words?

00:58.200 --> 01:01.125
Oh, she only writes in
emoticons.

01:01.161 --> 01:04.462
Her new boyfriend is
awesome, she's happy,

01:04.498 --> 01:08.041
and she tried calamari
for the first time!

01:08.076 --> 01:10.756
My pig Velma was voted prettiest
pig at the state fair!

01:11.063 --> 01:13.655
Huh.

01:13.691 --> 01:16.131
I've never seen a bathing suit
with six bikini tops before.

01:17.127 --> 01:19.167
Then I guess you've never
shopped at Pig Mart.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.012
Tiffany, what did you get?

01:21.047 --> 01:22.397
A birthday card from my mom.

01:22.432 --> 01:23.890
Happy birthday!

01:23.926 --> 01:25.126
What does it say?

01:26.478 --> 01:28.487
"I'm sorry for your loss.

01:28.522 --> 01:29.955
With measured
affection, Mother."

01:32.834 --> 01:37.203
Geez, birthday cards
have gotten bleak.

01:37.238 --> 01:39.355
She's just pointing out that I
lost another year of my life,

01:39.391 --> 01:41.616
in which I did not change
the face of science.

01:41.652 --> 01:43.718
Wow, that's heavy.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.182
Well, what are
your birthday parties like?

01:48.217 --> 01:50.208
Never had one.

01:50.243 --> 01:51.610
Mom believes in celebrating
accomplishments,

01:51.645 --> 01:53.887
not the passage of time.

01:53.922 --> 01:55.447
But she said
when I get into Harvard,

01:55.482 --> 01:57.098
she'll buy me a cake.

01:57.134 --> 01:58.894
And when I graduate,
she'll let me eat it!

02:00.403 --> 02:02.145
It's like that saying,

02:02.181 --> 02:04.097
"You can have your cake
and eat it, too,"

02:04.132 --> 02:05.332
after four years of college.

02:08.036 --> 02:11.088
Well, science doesn't
innovate itself.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.598
So, I'm off to discover
a new bacterial strain.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.754
If you need me, I'll be
swabbing Jorge's socks.

02:17.487 --> 02:20.005
Guys,

02:20.040 --> 02:21.481
we should throw Tiffany
a surprise birthday party!

02:21.516 --> 02:23.299
That's a great idea!

02:23.334 --> 02:25.318
I'll contact my
party vendors in New York!

02:25.354 --> 02:28.488
And I'll use my contacts
at Pig Mart.

02:28.524 --> 02:30.774
What? Pigs have parties, too.

02:30.809 --> 02:32.649
In fact, they're off the hoof.

02:36.332 --> 02:38.398
<i>¶ Here we go</i>

02:38.433 --> 02:41.093
<i>¶ We're leaving the city
behind right now</i>

02:41.128 --> 02:43.061
<i>¶ Let's gather by
the campfire light</i>

02:43.096 --> 02:44.838
<i>¶ And sing this song</i>

02:44.873 --> 02:48.091
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

02:48.127 --> 02:50.568
<i>¶ Hanging out with someone new</i>

02:50.604 --> 02:53.388
<i>¶ Then falling out
of a camp canoe</i>

02:53.424 --> 02:55.349
<i>¶ What's that smell?
It's on your shoe</i>

02:55.384 --> 02:58.142
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

02:58.178 --> 03:00.645
<i>¶ Got a s'more in my hair</i>

03:00.681 --> 03:03.122
<i>¶ Mosquitos in our underwear</i>

03:03.158 --> 03:04.858
<i>¶ Shower's broke
but we don't care</i>

03:04.893 --> 03:07.076
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

03:07.112 --> 03:11.681
<i>¶ This is our home away from home
away from home away from home</i>

03:11.716 --> 03:16.236
<i>¶ But watch your back
A bear just ate my phone</i>

03:16.271 --> 03:18.613
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka</i>

03:18.648 --> 03:21.024
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka</i>

03:21.060 --> 03:23.735
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka ¶</i>

03:33.255 --> 03:35.738
Okay, Ravi, it's your turn.

03:35.773 --> 03:37.440
I'm going to serve the ball and
I want you to volley it back.

03:37.476 --> 03:38.700
You got it, Coach!

03:38.735 --> 03:40.886
Just call me Volley Molly!

03:40.921 --> 03:43.188
On second thought, that
does not make any sense.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.824
Never call me that.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.059
Here it comes, Volley Molly!

03:48.696 --> 03:51.137
Ugh! Caught it!

03:53.716 --> 03:55.467
Good job. Usually
we try to hit it back,

03:55.502 --> 03:56.662
but, you know, baby steps.

03:58.496 --> 04:00.563
Hey, guys, look what I did!

04:00.598 --> 04:03.141
Oh, it is Wilson from that
movie starring

04:03.176 --> 04:05.652
America's favorite guy, Tom
Hanks!

04:05.687 --> 04:09.205
I have no idea who Wilson is,
or that Tom Hanks guy.

04:09.241 --> 04:11.808
This is Earl.

04:11.843 --> 04:13.209
Okay, Grizzlies,
I'm gonna serve it.

04:13.244 --> 04:14.494
Call it if it's yours.

04:16.272 --> 04:17.489
My ball!

04:17.524 --> 04:18.874
Whoa!

04:18.909 --> 04:21.393
Ow, my ankle!

04:21.428 --> 04:23.929
Jorge, I am so sorry!

04:23.964 --> 04:26.364
My athletic prowess
got the best of me.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.874
Are you all right?

04:27.909 --> 04:30.694
No! This hurts even worse

04:30.729 --> 04:33.104
than when I got my finger caught
in that dangerous cheese tray.

04:33.139 --> 04:34.379
That was a mouse trap.

04:37.844 --> 04:42.155
I can't believe poor Tiffany's
never had a birthday party before.

04:42.190 --> 04:45.233
We really need to
make this great for her.

04:45.268 --> 04:47.510
You're right. You know what I always
loved when I was Tiffany's age?

04:47.545 --> 04:49.570
Balloons!
We've gotta get balloons!

04:49.606 --> 04:50.939
I was thinking bigger than that.

04:50.974 --> 04:53.032
Gotcha. Hot air balloon.

04:53.067 --> 04:54.334
My cousin's got a basket
and a blowtorch.

04:54.370 --> 04:55.370
Done and done.

04:56.863 --> 05:00.498
I think we should have her
party in the camp library.

05:00.533 --> 05:04.052
Believe it or not,
it's her happy place.

05:04.129 --> 05:07.781
Yeah, 'cause nothing says
party like whispering.

05:07.816 --> 05:09.699
Hey, let's throw her a
backwoods shindig at The Spot!

05:09.735 --> 05:11.509
(GASPS) Brilliant!

05:11.544 --> 05:13.344
But let's give it a little
New York flair.

05:13.379 --> 05:15.730
Dress code: Black
ties and cowboy boots.

05:15.765 --> 05:18.525
I am so down for that hoedown!

05:18.560 --> 05:21.378
Uh, guys, I don't think
she'd like that.

05:21.413 --> 05:25.273
And I know because,
I'm very close to Tiffany.

05:25.308 --> 05:27.233
Okay, my bunk
is very close to Tiffany's.

05:29.629 --> 05:31.496
Listen, Zuri, you keep
Tiffany busy

05:31.531 --> 05:33.765
while we plan
this rustic chic affair.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.183
Great! Then it's settled.

05:35.218 --> 05:36.367
We'll have her surprise
birthday party

05:36.403 --> 05:38.478
at The Spot, Friday afternoon.

05:38.513 --> 05:42.248
Awww, they remembered
my birthday!

05:42.283 --> 05:43.933
So are we going with
the hot air balloon?

05:43.969 --> 05:46.219
If not, my cousin
also rents blimps.

05:46.254 --> 05:47.670
His backyard is huge!

05:51.368 --> 05:53.688
Do you think I'll ever sit
on the bench again, Coach?

05:54.888 --> 05:57.230
Oh, I'm sure you will.

05:57.265 --> 05:59.745
Let's see what the nurse says.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.602
Did somebody call for a nurse?

06:02.638 --> 06:04.762
Hazel, what are you doing here?

06:04.798 --> 06:07.438
Budget cuts. Gladys
made me Head Nurse.

06:08.334 --> 06:11.153
My diagnosis: Handsome-itis.

06:11.188 --> 06:12.604
The treatment:

06:12.639 --> 06:14.230
Take two of me every day!

06:14.265 --> 06:15.265
Boop!

06:16.951 --> 06:19.436
Jorge is the patient, not me.

06:19.471 --> 06:21.951
Although I'm suddenly
feeling very nauseous.

06:22.482 --> 06:23.639
Then I should examine you.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.951
Volleyball! We've gotta go!

06:25.986 --> 06:27.706
Stay strong, my brother!
(EXCLAIMS)

06:29.139 --> 06:30.930
I don't want you to treat me!

06:30.965 --> 06:32.849
You're not a real nurse!

06:32.884 --> 06:35.109
That's not true.
I took an online course.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.720
And when it's done buffering,
I'll finish it.

06:37.755 --> 06:39.939
You know, my ankle's
really not that bad.

06:39.974 --> 06:41.842
I'll just limp it off.

06:41.877 --> 06:45.645
Don't be silly. You should rest.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.473
Here's the remote for the TV.
I'll turn up the AC.

06:48.508 --> 06:50.158
Why are you being so nice to me?

06:50.194 --> 06:51.317
Am I dying?

06:53.004 --> 06:54.446
No, I'm just in a good mood.

06:54.481 --> 06:58.032
My friends are throwing me
a surprise birthday party.

06:58.068 --> 07:00.352
Time for your ice cream!

07:00.387 --> 07:04.872
Earl, <i>mi amigo,</i>
we've hit the jackpot.

07:04.907 --> 07:07.784
No, I will not share
my ice cream with you!

07:07.819 --> 07:09.459
Dairy makes you gassy!

07:14.017 --> 07:15.697
Surprise! (BOTH SCREAMING)

07:17.278 --> 07:19.870
I love surprises, don't you?

07:19.906 --> 07:23.791
And remember, when it comes to
celebrating, I love disco balls,

07:23.826 --> 07:25.885
jugglers, and limbo sticks!

07:25.920 --> 07:27.280
(GRUNTS) Oh!

07:30.308 --> 07:33.676
She must be drinking
the lake water again.

07:33.711 --> 07:35.553
Okay, Zuri, you keep
Tiffany, out of the cabin,

07:35.588 --> 07:36.921
while we plan her
birthday party.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.015
I just booked Lasso Larry!

07:39.050 --> 07:41.067
He's the best party cowboy
this side of the Mississippi.

07:41.102 --> 07:43.262
In fact, the only one.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.508
Hey, Zuri. Oh! Hey, Tiffany.

07:48.543 --> 07:50.503
Wanna hang out for
three to five hours?

07:52.039 --> 07:53.813
Well, I was going
to get a snack,

07:53.849 --> 07:55.540
then go back to the cabin
to study Swahili...

07:55.575 --> 07:58.001
Uh... No, you should do it here!

07:58.036 --> 07:59.852
And I would love
to study with you.

07:59.887 --> 08:01.137
But in this area only.

08:04.634 --> 08:06.817
Okay, if you want to...

08:06.853 --> 08:11.014
But I didn't know you were
interested in learning Swahili.

08:11.049 --> 08:15.518
Oh, yes, I love
all the languages.

08:15.554 --> 08:17.570
I always say, you can
never be too lingual.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.498
Great! <i>Hujambo!</i>

08:20.534 --> 08:21.534
Gesundheit!

08:23.820 --> 08:26.637
No. That means hello in Swahili.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.633
This is going to be a fun
three to five hours.

08:32.228 --> 08:35.004
My dance moves are on fire!

08:37.183 --> 08:38.183
(SHUDDERS)

08:40.495 --> 08:43.471
My ankle feels stronger
than ever!

08:46.159 --> 08:47.475
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

08:50.872 --> 08:52.188
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

08:53.299 --> 08:54.524
Come in.

08:57.596 --> 09:00.071
Jorge, you look pale
and sweatier than usual.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.499
How are you feeling?

09:04.402 --> 09:05.451
Dad?

09:06.371 --> 09:07.611
Is that you?

09:09.240 --> 09:12.333
No, it is Ravi,

09:12.368 --> 09:14.328
and I thought you just
sprained your ankle.

09:15.747 --> 09:18.028
Uh, yeah, it spread to my eyes.

09:19.834 --> 09:22.952
So, looks like
I'll be in here for a while.

09:22.987 --> 09:26.039
I feel terrible for putting
you in this invalid state,

09:26.074 --> 09:28.866
and making you miss
the Volleyball Tournament.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.735
Is there anything
I can do for you?

09:30.771 --> 09:33.396
Pray for me.

09:33.432 --> 09:36.107
Now please go, I need to rest.

09:43.358 --> 09:44.358
(DOOR CLOSES)

09:46.494 --> 09:49.137
Hey, Earl, what do you say
we crank this game up to

09:49.172 --> 09:51.130
level Beginner Plus.

09:51.165 --> 09:52.715
(MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)

09:52.750 --> 09:53.833
Jorge, I forgot to...

09:56.045 --> 09:57.562
Give you this "get well" card,

09:57.597 --> 10:01.391
but I guess it is moot,
because you clearly got well!

10:01.426 --> 10:04.066
Did not! I'm completely
incapacitated.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.100
I can't help it!
I was born to dance!

10:17.333 --> 10:20.593
I cannot believe you are
milking your injury!

10:20.628 --> 10:23.880
Dude, this place has
air conditioning, snacks,

10:23.915 --> 10:26.516
TV, it's pure luxury!

10:26.551 --> 10:28.701
I'd cut off my ankle
to stay in here!

10:30.638 --> 10:33.205
Plus, I'm totally hooked
on this show called

10:33.241 --> 10:34.715
<i>Yesterday's Tomorrow.</i>

10:34.750 --> 10:36.868
In other words, today?

10:36.903 --> 10:38.383
I don't get what you're saying.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.948
Anyway...

10:41.983 --> 10:43.483
Why don't you fake an injury

10:43.518 --> 10:45.218
and join me in here?

10:45.253 --> 10:47.437
I would never!

10:47.472 --> 10:50.373
Come on, I could really
use the company.

10:50.408 --> 10:51.608
Earl's not much of a talker.

10:54.178 --> 10:56.629
Plus, you'll get out of
that Volleyball Tournament.

10:56.665 --> 10:58.464
I do not want out.

10:58.499 --> 11:00.379
I am a valuable asset
to the team!

11:01.678 --> 11:03.027
I am a person on the team!

11:05.031 --> 11:06.698
Suit yourself. I will.

12:05.917 --> 12:08.037

imported from the Red Sea.

this cake "too good to eat."

22:22.266 --> 22:23.266
(GASPS)

22:24.118 --> 22:25.710
I want the rose!

22:25.745 --> 22:26.745
No, you don't.

22:32.276 --> 22:34.969
Nurse Hazel, might I trouble you
for some tropical fruit punch?

22:35.004 --> 22:37.104
No!

22:37.139 --> 22:38.859
I'm only serving
one kind of punch today.

22:40.342 --> 22:42.042
Abort! Abort!

22:42.077 --> 22:45.303
Hazel is back
to her old self. Hide!

22:45.339 --> 22:47.648
(GASPS) Do not leave me!
Earl, you coward!

22:50.335 --> 22:52.386
Time to check your reflexes!

22:52.421 --> 22:55.046
I assure you, they are fine.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.740
They won't be
when I'm done with them.

22:57.643 --> 23:02.963
Earl!
