00:03.337 --> 00:04.905
- Marco!
- Polo!
- Polo!

00:04.971 --> 00:06.507
- Marco!
- (both) Polo!

00:06.574 --> 00:07.441
Marco!

00:07.508 --> 00:08.309
Sì.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.743
- Marco.
- Escuse...

00:09.810 --> 00:11.512
Ma lo sono Marco Polo, ma...

00:11.579 --> 00:14.215
Announcer:
Playing Marco Polo
with Marco Polo?

00:14.282 --> 00:16.084
Surprising.
What's not surprising?

00:16.149 --> 00:17.630
How much money
Amanda and Keith saved

00:17.685 --> 00:18.685
by switching to Geico.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.203
My name is
Jean-Claude Van Damme.

00:35.269 --> 00:38.572
I used to be
super famous.

00:38.639 --> 00:42.476
Perhaps you remember my first
starring role in "Bloodsport."

00:42.543 --> 00:45.546
It is on television
all of the time.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.581
Or maybe you've
seen "Timecop,"

00:47.648 --> 00:50.518
which is like "Looper,"
starring Bruce Willis,

00:50.584 --> 00:53.821
but like a million
times better.

00:53.887 --> 00:57.691
But this is not a movie.

00:57.758 --> 01:00.228
And that man
is not an actor.

01:00.294 --> 01:04.265
He's trying to kill me.

01:05.399 --> 01:08.136
But I'm not worried because...

01:08.202 --> 01:09.803
I have a gift.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.675
I am the master
of the splits.

01:17.044 --> 01:20.214
Or at least I used to be.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.415
Fuck.

01:31.259 --> 01:34.828
How did this happen?

01:34.895 --> 01:36.530
How did I get here?

01:46.174 --> 01:50.178
JC, I used your shower
and now I'm all sticky.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.846
It's coconut water.

01:52.913 --> 01:55.783
Your shower uses
coconut water?

01:55.849 --> 01:59.920
All of the plumbing
uses coconut water.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.622
I don't understand.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.591
Of course not.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.259
You never do.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.229
This is the first time
I've been here.

02:09.663 --> 02:10.764
[heavy sigh]

02:13.033 --> 02:14.435
Let me help you
get dressed.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.497
My, uh, ramen is dry.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.998
Yeah, man,
that's what we do.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.333
Dry ramen.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.336
Uh, can you put some,
uh, water on mine?

03:55.403 --> 03:56.937
We actually don't have
access to water.

03:57.004 --> 04:00.308
We're a pop up experience,
not a restaurant.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.042
Okay, I don't understand.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.978
Dude.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.213
Oh, hey, no shit.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.615
Where you been, man?

04:07.681 --> 04:09.016
You got anything
coming out?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.082
I'm retired.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.819
What about on, uh, DVD?

04:11.885 --> 04:12.885
VOD?

04:12.920 --> 04:15.323
No, no.
Real retired.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.358
Not like
Nicholas Cage retired.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.327
Oh, fuck, man.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.496
I thought you were
Nicholas Cage.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.246
[gunshot]

04:39.347 --> 04:41.449
Shooting's about
finesse, JC.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.450
[gun cocking]

04:42.516 --> 04:44.385
You gotta have a soft touch.

04:44.452 --> 04:47.721
Yeah,
I'm not exactly known
for my soft touch.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.657
Let's try this.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.025
You told me about your
favorite childhood memory
once.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.361
You remember that?

04:53.394 --> 04:55.529
Yeah.
The farm.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.867
Your grandfather's
emu farm.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.502
Picture it.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.706
It's a beautiful day.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.477
Nowhere for you to be.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.513
Nothing for you to do.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.483
It's just you,

05:15.549 --> 05:18.419
and those big...

05:18.486 --> 05:19.853
majestic...

05:19.920 --> 05:22.390
[heart beating]

05:22.456 --> 05:23.557
...birds.

05:23.624 --> 05:27.194
- [gunshot]
- [metal clanging]

05:27.260 --> 05:28.729
Jean-Claude: Whoa.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.735
I love you.

05:34.802 --> 05:35.936
I love you.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.913
Vanessa.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.585
- What?
- Shit.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.196
- Hey, Vanessa, I called...
- I'm late for a flight.

05:53.220 --> 05:56.690
I wrote,
I tried everything.

05:56.757 --> 05:57.825
I miss you.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.494
What do you want me
to say to that?

06:00.561 --> 06:02.663
Let's have dinner tonight.
Let me explain.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.832
I'm flying to Bulgaria
in three hours.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.034
For a job?

06:07.100 --> 06:08.469
But I thought you quit.

06:08.536 --> 06:11.605
I didn't quit working, JC.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.441
I just quit working
with you.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.944
You take care
of yourself, okay?

06:19.346 --> 06:20.514
Vanessa.

06:22.916 --> 06:23.784
[sighs]

06:23.851 --> 06:25.753
Hey, bro, you forgot
your dry ramen.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.759
Val Kilmer?

06:31.825 --> 06:32.926
[sighs]

06:41.902 --> 06:43.103
Jane.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.205
It's your favorite client.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.474
I'm back.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.645
- Jane.
- JC.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.515
Goddamn,
I got such a hard on
when I heard your voice.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.517
Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.261
Hey, you ready to
pop the trunk on this shit?

06:58.285 --> 07:00.053
- Yes.
- Let's go.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.120
Where have you been?

07:01.154 --> 07:02.656
I've been relaxing.

07:02.723 --> 07:06.494
Uh-huh. That explains
no Christmas cards,
birthday cards.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.896
Okay, first up.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.765
Action re-imagining of
"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi."

07:11.832 --> 07:13.534
Channing Tatum's
playing the mongoose,

07:13.601 --> 07:14.868
you'd be one of
the cobras.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.336
This is set up
at Paramount.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.505
Jane.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.739
[clears throat]

07:18.806 --> 07:21.975
Action re-imaging of
"Anne of Green Gables."

07:22.042 --> 07:23.811
This was on
the black list last year.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.346
Kid who wrote it is
a garbage man in Fresno.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.916
Uh, honey,
those are not edible.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.851
Oh.

07:30.918 --> 07:31.719
[spitting]

07:31.785 --> 07:33.754
That's at Paramount.

07:33.821 --> 07:38.091
Okay.
This isn't Paramount.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.660
- Jane.
- Origin story.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.528
Of the restaurant
P.F. Chang's.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.063
But imagined as
an action movie.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.967
You'd be Richard Shaw,
sidekick to Phineas Fog Chang.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.936
- Channing Tatum
is attached.
- Jane.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.738
Jackie Chan's playing
General Tso,

07:50.804 --> 07:53.006
he's rides
a giant CG chicken.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.141
This is gonna be great.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.543
Jane!

07:57.578 --> 08:00.080
When I told you I was back,

08:00.147 --> 08:01.682
I did not mean JCVD.

08:04.552 --> 08:07.721
I meant... Johnson.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.661
I see.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.230
[electronic blips]

08:17.297 --> 08:19.933
Woman's Voice:
Director authorization
recognized.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.736
Security protocols engaged.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.138
Johnson has been retired
for two years.

08:28.175 --> 08:32.111
That's an eternity
in this line of work.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.581
Room secured.

08:33.614 --> 08:37.583
I stay active.
I play Frisbee golf.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.452
This isn't a game,
Jean-Claude.

08:39.587 --> 08:41.054
It's black ops.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.491
Real black ops,
not the game.

08:44.592 --> 08:47.127
I send you out there
before you're ready,
people die.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.029
No one's going to die.

08:49.096 --> 08:52.600
Except for all the people
I'm going to kill.

08:52.633 --> 08:56.003
I'll put out feelers,
see if there are any
low risk assignments.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.305
I want Bulgaria.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.440
Oh, the job
Vanessa's working.

09:00.608 --> 09:03.476
Honey,
that ship has sailed.
You had your chance.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.178
I want Bulgaria.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.614
That job is booked.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.415
My guy's
already on the ground.

09:08.481 --> 09:09.783
Who is it?

09:09.850 --> 09:12.485
Jones?
Thompson?

09:12.620 --> 09:14.622
- Brown.
- Brown.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.958
Brown is a monster.

09:18.025 --> 09:21.528
His, uh, methods
are a bit extreme,
but he's good.

09:21.629 --> 09:26.266
[scoffs] Brown is good,
but Johnson is better.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.871
I can make the call.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.106
For you,
I'll always make the call,

09:33.173 --> 09:36.343
but this isn't
just about the client
and you know that.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.011
You need
the cover job, too.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.081
And that movie starts
shooting in two days.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.684
Jane, I trust you.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.853
I'm going to pack.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.022
JC, please tell me
this isn't about Vanessa.

09:49.657 --> 09:50.858
[door opens]

09:50.924 --> 09:52.225
JC!

09:52.292 --> 09:53.326
[door closes]

09:59.299 --> 10:01.268
[phone rings]

10:01.334 --> 10:02.369
[beep]

10:02.435 --> 10:03.871
Jane:
Well, JC, good news.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.939
I worked my magic.

10:06.006 --> 10:09.276
The mission and
cover job are yours.

10:09.342 --> 10:12.479
That's right,
Bulgaria's a go.

10:12.545 --> 10:16.083
But you're going up against
bloodthirsty drug runners,

10:16.149 --> 10:18.852
so, yeah,
I hope you're ready.

10:18.919 --> 10:22.289
Because... ready or not,

10:22.355 --> 10:25.358
Johnson is back.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.593
Hiya.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.228
[grunting]

10:28.295 --> 10:29.295
Oh, shit.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.410
[sighs]

10:47.314 --> 10:48.348
Ta-dah!

10:48.415 --> 10:50.350
Motherfucker.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.655
I can't believe
you pulled this.

10:55.723 --> 10:58.125
- Vanessa...
- Don't, don't even.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.728
You know how much
this job means to me.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.930
How hard I've worked
to get here.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.332
I'm not letting you
fuck that up for me.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.304
Get to work or get lost,
your call.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.784
Heroin cut with ketamine.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.219
Kids call it HK.
Hong Kong.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.755
It's being smuggled in
cans of motor oil.

11:28.756 --> 11:31.792
It's highly addictive
and highly lethal.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.927
All right,
you're set.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.131
We know the source?

11:38.198 --> 11:40.267
Intel points to
a factory outside of town.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.493
I'm gonna run recon this
morning while you're shooting.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.871
If it checks out,

11:43.937 --> 11:45.614
we'll get you in there
at the end of the week.

11:45.638 --> 11:46.774
End of the week?

11:46.840 --> 11:48.251
I thought
it might make sense for you

11:48.275 --> 11:50.778
to spend the week
warming up with stunt work.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.780
Before you have to do
the real thing.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.181
You know.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.049
On the off chance
you didn't walk in here

11:56.116 --> 11:58.418
in peak physical condition.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.121
Wait, stunt work.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.589
In this movie?

12:02.655 --> 12:05.893
You haven't even
looked at the script.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.828
- [scoffs]
- Vanessa.

12:09.062 --> 12:12.232
- Hey.
- Maybe you've
forgotten, JC,

12:12.299 --> 12:15.202
but what you do is
fucking dangerous.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.805
You waltz in here
unprepared,

12:17.871 --> 12:21.274
it's not just you that's
gonna end up splattered
across the field.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.610
[door opens]

12:23.676 --> 12:25.813
[thudding]

12:31.618 --> 12:32.719
Where's Brown?

12:32.820 --> 12:35.388
Last minute
personnel change.

12:35.455 --> 12:36.456
This is Johnson.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.691
Johnson, meet Luis.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.027
Where's Marcus?

12:40.093 --> 12:42.729
Retired.
For real retired.

12:42.830 --> 12:46.266
Not Jean-Claude Van Damme
retired.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.700
Is he qualified?

12:47.835 --> 12:50.570
I was top of my class
at the Paul Mitchell academy.

12:50.637 --> 12:53.941
Plus a Beacon award at
the PBA Beauty Week 2014.

12:54.007 --> 12:56.409
And before that?

12:56.476 --> 12:58.145
[whirring]

12:59.847 --> 13:03.884
I spent nine years
as a child soldier
in El cartel de Los Zetas.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.718
- Woman: Mr. Van Damme.
- Yep.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.320
They're ready for you now.

13:14.327 --> 13:17.264
We could run away,
head out west.

13:18.999 --> 13:22.135
We have more than enough
gold left.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.872
No more running.
It ends tonight.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.439
[thunder]

13:26.506 --> 13:29.142
[footsteps]

13:31.979 --> 13:33.180
He's here.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.291
I love you, Tom Sawyer.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.326
Oh, Huck.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.795
[thudding]

13:48.896 --> 13:51.264
Huckleberry Finn.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.331
Pop.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.567
Daddy's home.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.038
[metal scraping]

13:58.105 --> 14:00.941
Ahh. There's a new man
of the house.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.943
[yelling]

14:11.518 --> 14:12.619
[yelling]

14:16.423 --> 14:17.423
[yelling]

14:22.329 --> 14:23.396
[yelling]

14:25.565 --> 14:27.034
[groaning]

14:37.544 --> 14:38.578
What the fuck!

14:38.645 --> 14:41.514
Director:
Cut! Cut.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.050
Okay, reset.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.218
Uh, second team,
let's...

14:45.285 --> 14:46.954
Chrissy, baby.
I am really sorry.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.321
- Fix it.
- On it.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.956
Okay, uh,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:49.957 --> 14:52.592
Uh, I know the
choreography is tough.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.427
Um, it's kind of
my trademark, though.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.964
Yes, I remember
from the commercial

14:57.030 --> 14:58.431
with the, uh,
dancing hamsters.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.267
- Yeah, exactly.
- I know, it's so...

15:00.333 --> 15:02.413
That's okay, this is what
we're gonna do. Sit down...

15:05.605 --> 15:07.975
How's he looking?

15:10.043 --> 15:11.211
Luis: Not good.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.881
What's the story
with you two?

15:14.982 --> 15:16.583
[sighs]

15:18.051 --> 15:19.319
We were a team.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.523
I did hair and recon,
he...

15:23.590 --> 15:24.624
did what he does,

15:24.691 --> 15:28.028
and eventually,

15:28.095 --> 15:30.897
it's the classic story,

15:30.998 --> 15:34.167
he spinning back heel
kicked his way into my heart.

15:36.203 --> 15:40.707
The chemistry was instant.
It was undeniable.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.376
But we didn't want
to jeopardize the work,

15:43.443 --> 15:45.378
so we tried to fight it.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.781
You know,
we shouldn't be
doing this at all.

15:48.848 --> 15:50.350
We should not be...

15:50.417 --> 15:53.586
But every time we came back
together for a mission,

15:53.653 --> 15:55.855
we picked up right
where we had left off,

15:55.922 --> 16:00.460
until finally we realized
there was no point
in fighting it.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.163
So we decided to
take some time off.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.897
Together.

16:05.032 --> 16:07.867
I went to Bali while he
finished up his press tour

16:07.934 --> 16:11.171
and I waited for him.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.606
But he never showed up.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.612
I went my way.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.348
He went his and...

16:21.414 --> 16:23.683
eventually,
he retired altogether.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.885
And now he's back.

16:25.952 --> 16:27.320
Now he's back.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.658
So what's your story?

16:32.825 --> 16:34.427
[gunshots]

16:34.494 --> 16:35.494
[screaming]

16:37.164 --> 16:38.931
It's not
that interesting.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.200
I'll tell you later.

16:41.768 --> 16:46.339
Jean-Claude:
You're right.
With Pop dead...

16:46.406 --> 16:49.676
it would be easy now
to go someplace warm.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.378
We got a problem.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.347
We'll be fine,
I just need to
stretch a bit more.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.848
Not you.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.617
It's the factory.

16:59.486 --> 17:02.089
I don't know how,
but they must have gotten
tipped off.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.290
They've started
moving the drugs out.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.758
How long do we have?

17:05.825 --> 17:07.327
It'll be empty
by tonight.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.329
Which means
you need to find a way
to change the schedule.

17:10.396 --> 17:14.101
You need to be
wrapped by 6,
7 p.m. at the latest.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.972
...and, you know,
couldn't do it.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.840
Real hamsters
is more practical.

17:21.907 --> 17:22.917
- They did good, though.
- Excuse me.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.344
Ah, JC. Perfect.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.921
I want you to meet
one of your co-stars,

17:25.944 --> 17:27.814
this is Victor.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.182
Big fan,
Mr. Van Damme.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.850
Really excited to be
working with you.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.252
- Same here.
- Thank you.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.121
Victor's playing
"N" word Jim.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.391
Okay.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.160
Can I talk to you
for a second?

17:40.227 --> 17:42.195
Yeah. Yeah.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.430
What's up, babe?

17:44.664 --> 17:48.635
Well, it's about,
uh, my choreography.

17:48.701 --> 17:52.472
It doesn't have
the right feel.

17:52.539 --> 17:56.042
Okay, so... Okay.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.145
I have TBS, all right?

17:58.211 --> 18:00.580
So I've seen "Kickboxer"
like, a hundy times, right?

18:00.647 --> 18:02.882
I love it just like
everybody else.

18:02.949 --> 18:05.151
But that
'80s style of fighting,

18:05.152 --> 18:06.519
the style that
you're known for,

18:06.586 --> 18:09.856
with the kicking
and the spinning
and the splits

18:09.922 --> 18:11.134
in the middle of the s...
you know,

18:11.158 --> 18:12.859
with the guys one at time
coming...

18:12.925 --> 18:15.162
It's not realistic.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.996
And we all
know that now.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.698
You know?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.700
All I'm saying
maybe we can spend
half a day...

18:20.767 --> 18:23.903
Oh, no, it's okay.
I get it, I get it,
I get it.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.372
I... I hear you.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.807
But hey,
we're gonna roll
with the punches.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.509
[inhaling]

18:29.576 --> 18:33.180
Pow. Oh.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.849
Roll with the punches.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.618
Director: Camera's set!

18:38.685 --> 18:39.486
Action!

18:39.552 --> 18:40.820
[yelling]

18:40.887 --> 18:42.455
- Cut! Cut!
- JC.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.524
- I'm so, so sorry, man.
- Holy shit.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.269
I totally...
I totally thought
you were gonna duck.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.328
Okay, that's a wrap,
everyone.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.196
Vanessa:
It's simple.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.098
Get in, find the HK,

18:52.199 --> 18:56.002
then all you need to do is
get one of these trackers

18:56.068 --> 18:57.237
on one of their shipments.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.571
[beeping]

18:58.638 --> 19:00.873
Remember, if you
blow your cover,

19:00.940 --> 19:03.876
the entire operation
goes down in flames,

19:03.943 --> 19:05.778
so stick to the plan.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.852
Luis: Johnson.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.721
Here's your weapon.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.456
I've got my own weapons.

19:21.428 --> 19:22.695
[tires squealing]

19:29.669 --> 19:30.669
Vanessa.

19:30.703 --> 19:31.703
Give me a sec.

19:34.807 --> 19:35.842
Okay, I got you.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.711
I'm in.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.848
I'll meet you
back in my room
in 59 minutes.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.716
Your room?

19:43.783 --> 19:47.254
You know, for mission review
and alibi briefing.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.721
Right, yeah,
that location's

19:48.788 --> 19:50.923
not gonna work for me
this time around.

19:53.092 --> 19:54.092
[grunting]

19:54.126 --> 19:55.628
I can come to your room.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.965
How about
we do that dinner?

19:59.031 --> 20:01.200
Hotel restaurant.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.702
Work only.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.804
- [gasping]
- [neck snapping]

20:04.871 --> 20:06.339
Work only.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.576
[beeping]

20:10.977 --> 20:13.079
I'm in uniform.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.681
Headed to the entrance.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.750
Slow it down a sec.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.057
I've got
a half a dozen workers

20:19.085 --> 20:21.488
coming up on your position.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.058
There's another group
approaching.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.328
I need to see which
direction they're headed.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.503
You're right.

20:36.569 --> 20:41.173
With Pop dead,
it would be a more
comfortable life.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.742
Comfortable life.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.211
I don't want to do
what's easy, Tom.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.318
I want to do what's right.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.047
What did you say?

20:48.114 --> 20:50.883
Wait.
What are you doing?

20:52.619 --> 20:53.619
Nothing.

20:55.121 --> 20:59.659
Please tell me
you didn't bring
your script.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.496
You said yourself
I need to be prepared.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.807
Being prepared for
tomorrow's scenes

21:04.831 --> 21:06.333
isn't gonna do you
a lot of good

21:06.399 --> 21:07.610
- if you're dead tonight.
- [beeping]

21:07.634 --> 21:08.634
Down!

21:18.411 --> 21:21.113
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to
lay eyes on me.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.482
Hey!

21:24.751 --> 21:27.119
Philippe.
How is it going?

21:27.186 --> 21:28.555
Good.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.358
Good, good.
Well, I don't
want to keep you.

21:35.495 --> 21:39.799
Okay. The HK should be
through those double doors.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.573
Hey, Philippe.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.043
What is this?

21:51.110 --> 21:52.412
What's happening here?

21:52.479 --> 21:54.681
Just go with it.

21:54.747 --> 21:55.848
Hey, Philippe.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.389
Hey, Philippe.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.956
Hey, Philippe.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.892
[beeping]

22:09.429 --> 22:12.031
Hey, it's just me,
Philippe.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.766
[gasping]

22:15.868 --> 22:17.904
Who are you?

22:17.970 --> 22:21.441
Um... I'm you.

22:21.508 --> 22:25.044
From the future,
and I'm here to warn you

22:25.111 --> 22:28.415
that something bad's
going to happen
to this factory.

22:31.317 --> 22:33.219
You should leave.

22:33.285 --> 22:35.822
You're not me
from the future.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.323
What?

22:37.424 --> 22:40.259
Like matter
cannot occupy like space.

22:40.326 --> 22:41.326
"Timecop."

22:41.428 --> 22:42.895
[sighs] "Timecop."

22:42.962 --> 22:43.830
Have you seen it?

22:43.896 --> 22:45.965
- Yeah.
- So you know the rules.

22:46.032 --> 22:49.702
Like matter
cannot occupy like space.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.905
But, uh, in "Looper"
Bruce Willis

22:52.972 --> 22:56.443
and Joseph Gordon-Levitt
touch many times.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.511
If you are really me,

22:58.578 --> 23:01.981
do you think "Looper,"
it's a better movie
than "Timecop"?

23:05.485 --> 23:07.587
- Yes.
- False.

23:07.654 --> 23:10.923
I think "Timecop"
is way better than "Looper."

23:15.327 --> 23:17.029
[grunting]

23:17.096 --> 23:18.798
[gasping]

23:18.865 --> 23:22.168
You've got
excellent taste in films.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.536
[neck snapping]

23:35.281 --> 23:37.484
[beeping]

23:41.621 --> 23:43.355
[bottles rattling]

23:43.490 --> 23:45.157
[electronic blip]

23:45.224 --> 23:46.492
Okay,
I've got the signal.

23:46.493 --> 23:47.860
Now get out of there.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.296
What, are you
worried about me?

23:50.362 --> 23:52.098
[sighs]

23:52.164 --> 23:54.534
Well, you gotta admit,
that was a strange one,

23:54.601 --> 23:56.068
even for you.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.403
But hey...

23:57.504 --> 23:59.405
that's mission
success.

23:59.506 --> 24:00.816
I'll meet you at
the restaurant in 30.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.775
Just don't
stand me up this time.

24:02.842 --> 24:03.842
[sighs]

24:12.151 --> 24:13.953
Oh, shit.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.522
Vanessa.

24:15.555 --> 24:16.656
Vanessa,
can you hear me?

24:16.723 --> 24:18.090
I've got to go back.

24:18.157 --> 24:19.191
I dropped my script.

24:19.258 --> 24:21.127
It has my
fucking name on it.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.270
Psst.

24:31.337 --> 24:33.372
[grunting]

24:33.439 --> 24:34.841
"And what about us?"

24:34.907 --> 24:37.677
"You promised we'd start
a family of our own."

24:37.744 --> 24:39.579
"The family we never had."

24:41.848 --> 24:45.384
"Huck, we already have."

24:45.451 --> 24:46.753
[thud]

24:50.557 --> 24:52.058
Jean-Claude Van Damme?

24:57.564 --> 24:58.698
Yeah.

25:52.652 --> 25:55.755
I love you.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.265
Huh?

26:09.135 --> 26:10.135
[grunting]

26:15.541 --> 26:16.743
Hah.

[yelling]

26:24.884 --> 26:26.352
- Me want!
- [screaming]

26:26.418 --> 26:27.787
No, no, no.
One at a time,

26:27.854 --> 26:28.894
or you run into
each other.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.422
Could get confusing.
Go!

26:30.489 --> 26:31.958
- Go!

27:56.242 --> 27:57.242
Are you okay?

[knocking]

28:05.752 --> 28:08.320
Vanessa.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.756
Vanessa, please.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.260
I can explain.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.295
[knocking]

28:16.362 --> 28:19.165
JC. Hey, man.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.334
Look, Vanessa wanted me
to tell you that

28:22.401 --> 28:25.171
it's not a good time.

28:25.237 --> 28:26.338
Sorry.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.430
- Jane.
- Before you say
another word,

28:51.497 --> 28:55.201
yes, Brown is telling people
that he's coming for you,

28:55.267 --> 28:56.568
but I'm on it.

28:56.635 --> 28:58.504
Don't worry.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.172
I'm not calling
about Brown.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.841
Oh, no.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.409
Honey,
you don't sound good.

29:03.475 --> 29:06.846
Jane, the job is harder
than I remember it.

29:06.913 --> 29:10.049
The movie's shit.

29:10.116 --> 29:13.085
And the woman I love...

29:13.152 --> 29:15.955
is fucking "N" word Jim.

29:25.731 --> 29:29.168
The woman I love.

29:29.235 --> 29:32.138
I should never
have come back.
