00:32.616 --> 00:36.279
CHLOE: Hey, I must have tripped
every speed trap in Smallville to get here.

00:36.453 --> 00:37.954
What happened?

00:38.122 --> 00:40.238
I got another SOS from Kara.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.289
And?

00:44.044 --> 00:46.330
"Krypton will be destroyed any minute.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.338
Brainiac is getting closer. Please hurry.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.548
Your life depends on it."

00:52.720 --> 00:57.965
So Brainiac used Kara to time-jump
back to the day that the planet exploded.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.138
Which means all he has to do
is stop that ship...

01:02.312 --> 01:05.145
...that carried you as a baby
from leaving Krypton and—

01:05.315 --> 01:08.478
You'd be standing alone
in an empty barn.

01:11.155 --> 01:15.023
Clark, if they made the quantum leap,
there must be a way you can too.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.649
Yeah.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.990
Kara mentioned the Fortress
has the ability to send me back.

01:20.164 --> 01:23.702
If I take the octagonal disk there,
Jor-El can make it happen.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.080
Then why are you still here?

01:28.255 --> 01:31.292
I mean, you should be halfway
to Krypton by now.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.839
I'm not going.

01:36.638 --> 01:40.756
But you have to stop Brainiac or you'll fade
away. This could happen at any moment.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.266
-I understand.
-Okay, I know what you're thinking.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.520

it cost your father his life.

You don't have a choice.

and I'm making it right now.

01:52.154 --> 01:56.693
Ever since I arrived, all I brought is death
and suffering, meteor freaks, phantoms.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.448
And Brainiac.

02:00.621 --> 02:04.330
Clark, you've done so much good.
You can't blame yourself...

02:04.500 --> 02:07.537

you'll have no idea I was ever here.

You're going back to Krypton now.

off her feet.

16:08.009 --> 16:10.295
Pretty handy having a meteor freak
on my side.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.880
I'm not a meteor freak.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.046
Right. It may be a mess...

16:14.223 --> 16:18.011
...but Olsen's loft is the last place Luthor's
storm troopers would come looking.

16:18.186 --> 16:20.518
Mind telling me
why you're public enemy number one?

16:20.688 --> 16:23.555
I'm not. I happen to have
a highly classiﬁed document...

16:23.733 --> 16:27.351
...that proves Luthor is putting the country
in jeopardy. Look at this.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.439
LEX [ON VIDEO]:
Satellite images have revealed...

16:29.614 --> 16:31.570
...that our enemy
has deployed nuclear missiles...

16:31.741 --> 16:33.732
...within striking distance of our country.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.071
My fellow Americans...

16:36.245 --> 16:39.032
...a threat in our own backyard
will not be tolerated.

One little problem.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.167

as my uncle's hairpiece.

It's no surprise that Lex would lie.

16:56.099 --> 16:58.886

that wasn't there?

While the DDS was chauffeuring me
to my inquisition...

17:02.355 --> 17:05.973
...I overheard an agent saying they
were taking the eagle to the mountaintop.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.061
It sounds like some kind of code.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.898
It means they're moving Luther
to the NORAD bunker.

17:11.072 --> 17:14.360
They would only do that for one reason:
nuclear war.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.866
And since the threat is fake...

17:18.037 --> 17:22.451
...it means he wants to give the enemy
a sucker punch with a preemptive strike.

17:23.084 --> 17:27.123
I need to post the truth on the Planet's
front page before Luthor presses the button.

17:27.296 --> 17:31.130

each side will destroy the other.

Well, that's what I don't understand.
Luthor's not suicidal.

Milton Fine doesn't care what happens
to this planet...

18:01.164 --> 18:02.870
He's a machine.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.997
He might come off a little stiff on Larry King

If I was here to take him on,
this wouldn't have happened.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.426
Let's go.

33:35.806 --> 33:39.424
Come on, Clark. To the portal.
We've gotta go.

34:09.131 --> 34:11.964
Please let me know
the minute anything changes.

34:14.428 --> 34:17.340
The nurse said
Lana seems worse than ever.

34:18.849 --> 34:21.556
I know I destroyed Brainiac.

34:22.811 --> 34:25.803
I thought if he died,
it would break his grip over Lana...

34:25.981 --> 34:27.642
...but I was wrong.

34:29.818 --> 34:32.025
I don't know what else to do.

34:33.780 --> 34:36.271
Clark, I am so sorry.

34:38.618 --> 34:40.574
Maybe if we reopen the portal
to Krypton--

34:40.746 --> 34:42.327
We can't.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.614
As much as I want Lana well again,
there's no going back.

34:46.543 --> 34:49.831
But if we go back,
there's so much more we could do.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.461
We could save our home.

34:53.175 --> 34:56.212
You don't know how many times
I wish I could've done that.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.836
But you know it's possible.

34:59.347 --> 35:02.430
If we just ﬁnd the right point in time,
we can ﬁx everything.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.508
But how do we know
we won't make it worse?

35:11.651 --> 35:14.984
We can't change the past, Kara.
We can only affect the future.

35:18.867 --> 35:21.233
Whatever that future is...

35:22.454 --> 35:25.446
...I want you to know
that I'll always be there.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.792
I'm here for you.

35:55.529 --> 35:58.020
This place hasn't changed a bit
since I last saw it.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.569
What are you doing here?

36:04.246 --> 36:07.704
You were the last person to see Lana
while she was well.

36:08.041 --> 36:11.909
I ﬁgured you're the one to talk to
if I have any chance of helping her.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.830
No one's asking for your help.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.590
I'm only trying to save her, Clark.

36:20.053 --> 36:22.669
I had the best medical minds
in the world examine her.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.470
Is there anything the doctors can do
to help her?

36:31.773 --> 36:35.686
They tell me her condition
is unlike any they've ever seen.

36:37.362 --> 36:40.570
Several specialists described it...

36:40.949 --> 36:42.689
...as almost alien.

36:45.996 --> 36:49.238
So the best doctors in the world
can't do anything to help Lana?

36:49.624 --> 36:52.457
Unfortunately, they've all come
to the same conclusion.

36:55.005 --> 36:57.496
Her state is irreversible.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.124
That's why I came to you, Clark.

37:01.845 --> 37:06.134
If we could ﬁnd out what triggered Lana's
syndrome, maybe we could have hope.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.643
Think, Clark.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.855
She was living with you.

37:16.484 --> 37:19.021
Is there anything you can remember
that might explain...

37:19.195 --> 37:21.277
...how this could have happened?

37:27.704 --> 37:29.786
I wish there was.

37:39.674 --> 37:42.962
If there's something you left out
that you'd like to share...

37:43.428 --> 37:45.589
...you know where to ﬁnd me.

I'm just borrowing the Planet's database.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.546
Oh.

38:29.724 --> 38:30.839
I'm no expert...

38:31.017 --> 38:34.384
...but I'm sure that someone is out there
who can help Lana.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.810
With all my years of watching Dr. Phil...

38:39.985 --> 38:42.897
...you'd think I could come up
with the perfect thing to say...

38:43.571 --> 38:45.562
...but I'm drawing a blank.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.405
I don't do well with sad.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.078
It's okay.

38:57.544 --> 38:58.704
No, it's not.

38:59.295 --> 39:02.378
You were there for me
when I needed a shoulder to cry on...

39:02.549 --> 39:05.086
...and I am blowing this bigtime.

39:06.052 --> 39:09.920

everything all right.

You're a good friend, Lois.

Hey, you know what?

39:22.944 --> 39:26.357
Why don't we go drown our sorrows?

39:26.948 --> 39:30.440
Why don't I buy you a brew?
You look like you could use one.

39:31.953 --> 39:35.366
Seriously, check out your driver's license.
We're legal now.
