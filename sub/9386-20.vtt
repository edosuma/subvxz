WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:04.546
It seems today
that all you see

00:04.630 --> 00:07.799
Is violence in movies
and sex on TV

00:07.883 --> 00:11.303
But where are
those good old-fashioned values

00:11.386 --> 00:14.014
On which we
used to rely?

00:14.097 --> 00:17.809
Lucky there's
a family guy

00:17.893 --> 00:21.271
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

00:21.355 --> 00:22.898
All the things
that make us

00:22.981 --> 00:24.691
Laugh and cry

00:24.775 --> 00:29.613
He's a family guy

00:33.951 --> 00:35.410
All right,
all bets are in.

00:35.494 --> 00:38.205
Ooh, Rupert, bad idea
trusting the Celtics.

00:38.288 --> 00:41.291
Worse than when
I trusted Brian to pack my parachute.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.558
Hey, Brian, care
to place a wager?

00:57.641 --> 00:59.601
Tomorrow night on
Fox's Celebrity Boxing,

00:59.685 --> 01:02.729
I've got Carol Channing
beating Mike Tyson in three rounds.

01:02.813 --> 01:03.856
Carol Channing.

01:03.939 --> 01:06.024
You've got Carol
Channing, the actress,

01:06.108 --> 01:08.068
beating Mike Tyson,
the boxer.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.611
Hell, give me
$50 on Tyson.

01:09.695 --> 01:10.904
Well, you're
in good company.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.865
Betting Freddy took
the same wager.

01:12.948 --> 01:15.826
(stutter) Bet!

01:15.909 --> 01:19.413
Wait a minute.
There's nothing funny about an addiction.

01:19.496 --> 01:22.207
Vote no on Indian
gaming laws.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.421
MALE TV. HOST:
And we're back with Fox Celebrity Boxing

01:27.504 --> 01:29.423
with Mike Tyson
and Carol Channing.

01:29.506 --> 01:32.509
I tell you, Jim,
how Carol Channing outlasted that barrage

01:32.593 --> 01:34.344
in the second round,
we'll never know.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.929
(bell dings)

01:36.013 --> 01:38.223
(crowd cheering)

01:38.307 --> 01:41.059
Come here, young man.
I'm gonna bop you one.

01:43.187 --> 01:45.063
(crowd cheering)

01:45.147 --> 01:46.148
She's getting beat!

01:46.231 --> 01:48.108
No, she's getting mad.

01:48.192 --> 01:50.736
Ah! You ain't so
tough, young man.

01:53.197 --> 01:55.282
That all you got,
you son of a bitch?

01:55.365 --> 01:57.117
You're going down,
young man.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.748
You're going down!

02:02.831 --> 02:04.082
I can't--
I can't believe this.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.459
She keeps getting up.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.627
I'm so exhausted.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.295
(crowd gasps)

02:08.378 --> 02:09.796
(bell ding)

02:09.880 --> 02:11.715
And the winner,
by technical knockout,

02:11.798 --> 02:14.092
weighing in
at 67 pounds,

02:14.176 --> 02:17.179
Carol "Put On
Your Sunday Clothes" Channing.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.223
-Yeah!
-(crowd boo)

02:19.306 --> 02:21.308
Up yours,
young people.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.353
You and your
rock and roll 8-track tapes!

02:24.436 --> 02:27.272
I don't believe this.
I just lost a $50 bet.

02:27.356 --> 02:29.816
You know, Mike Tyson
once beat up his wife.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.152
But there's nothing
funny about that.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.239
(giggle)

02:35.322 --> 02:37.491
Hi, guys. We're back
from the mall.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.201
I got new shoes.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.954
The old ones are
in the box. Ha ha ha.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.373
They smell and are old.

02:44.456 --> 02:47.835
Hey, Peter, your 25th high-school
reunion is next Sunday.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.503
Throw that away.
I don't want to go.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.130
Besides, Sunday's
my Internet porn night.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.008
Oh, yeah!

02:55.092 --> 02:57.928
You're my Chinese Lois.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.596
(crickets chirping)

03:01.098 --> 03:02.516
Hey, it's me.
Knock, knock.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.644
So, uh, you got, uh--
you got my money?

03:05.727 --> 03:07.521
Huh? Oh, yeah.
I'll-- I'll pay you soon.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.232
Yeah, well, um,
here's a suggestion.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.775
Um, have the money
by tomorrow,

03:11.859 --> 03:13.277
and there won't be
any problems.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.279
-Huh?
-Yeah, 24 hours.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.947
Why? What--What happens
in 24 hours?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.991
Huh? I don't know. (scoffs)
I'm not psychic, man.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.993
I'm just saying
it would probably be better for everybody

03:21.076 --> 03:22.744
-if you had the money tomorrow.
-Yeah, all right.

03:22.828 --> 03:25.622
-I'll see what I can do.
-Sweet, sweet. Great.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.541
-How's everything else going?
-Good.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.918
All right. All right,
see you later.

03:30.002 --> 03:31.170
Don't forget.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.754
No, you're not
gonna forget.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.967
Hey, Peter, I was going
through your garbage,

03:37.050 --> 03:39.094
and I noticed
your high school reunion is coming up.

03:39.178 --> 03:40.345
Why were you going
through my garbage?

03:40.429 --> 03:41.680
Well, when I stopped
over earlier,

03:41.763 --> 03:43.390
I noticed Lois
clipping her toenails,

03:43.473 --> 03:45.058
and I thought,
"Oh, man, I got to get in on that."

03:45.142 --> 03:46.310
Huh.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.228
Yeah, I don't think
I'm going to my reunion.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.147
Everybody's all got
their nice cars,

03:50.230 --> 03:51.481
and their big,
important jobs,

03:51.565 --> 03:53.192
and their fancy hats,

03:53.275 --> 03:54.651
and their fresh
strawberries

03:54.735 --> 03:56.778
so big you can eat
them like a hand fruit.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.281
Peter, everyone lies
at those things.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.616
Just tell them
you're a big shot.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.826
Wait a second, Joe,
that's a great idea.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.954
Boy, imagine
what it would be like to be a big shot.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.585
Diego?

04:11.668 --> 04:12.753
Sweaty.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.546
Aaaah.

04:14.630 --> 04:15.923
Thank you.

04:23.805 --> 04:24.890
Stewie, uh, hey.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.935
Hey, there.
So, uh, it's been 24 hours.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.728
-Got my money?
-Oh, uh, you know what?

04:29.811 --> 04:31.980
Just give me
till next Friday. I'll have it for you.

04:32.064 --> 04:33.482
Oh... Oh, that's funny.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.234
I could have sworn
I said have it today.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.610
Yeah, I don't have it,
sorry.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.904
Oh. Well.
All right, then.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.989
Mmm. That's good OJ.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.824
(scream)

04:42.908 --> 04:45.327
-Yeah, that hurt? That hurt?
-What the hell?

04:45.410 --> 04:47.829
Yeah, doesn't
feel so good, does it? No?

04:47.913 --> 04:49.998
Oh! Ah! Ow!

04:50.082 --> 04:51.542
Yeah, that's
what happens, man.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.626
Oh, my God.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.877
Yeah, that's
what happens.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.462
Oh! Ah! Ah!

04:55.546 --> 04:56.797
Where's my money?

04:57.631 --> 04:58.757
You gonna give me
my money?

04:58.841 --> 05:00.092
Where's my money, man?

05:03.011 --> 05:04.346
Where's the money?

05:04.429 --> 05:06.390
Ahhh. Ahhh!

05:06.473 --> 05:08.016
Yeah, you like that?
That feel good?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.184
That feel good?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.144
(scream)

05:11.228 --> 05:13.689
Where's the money, man?
Where's my money?

05:16.942 --> 05:19.069
You've got till 5:00.
You hear me?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.571
You got till 5:00.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.281
You freaking psychopath!

05:22.364 --> 05:23.991
Clean yourself up.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.622
(chatter)

05:30.706 --> 05:31.957
Peter, this is
ridiculous.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.500
Why can't you
just be yourself?

05:33.584 --> 05:35.002
PETER: Lois, just
go along with it.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.086
Act like I'm a big shot.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.171
(sigh)

05:37.254 --> 05:39.506
Hey, Peter Griffin,
is that you?

05:39.590 --> 05:41.466
Hey, Mike,
long time no see.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.093
Wow. What...

05:43.177 --> 05:45.470
-What's all this?
-Oh, this? I just came from work.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.890
I'm a secret agent
astronaut millionaire.

05:47.973 --> 05:50.058
Cool. Where'd you get
the cowboy hat?

05:50.976 --> 05:51.977
Space.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.395
Oh, by the way,
this is my friend, Tom.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.857
(gasp) You're Tom
Brady from the New England Patriots!

05:56.940 --> 05:59.067
Oh, man, I got to tell
you, you kick ass, man.

05:59.151 --> 06:00.903
In fact, I was
just saying that the other day

06:00.986 --> 06:02.321
to all the guys down
at the brewery.

06:02.404 --> 06:05.324
Brewery? I thought
you were a cowboy astronaut millionaire.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.575
He's a fake!

06:06.658 --> 06:08.827
Look, this cowboy hat
comes right off.

06:08.911 --> 06:11.538
(laughter)

06:13.332 --> 06:16.335
Coming here was
a huge mistake, Lois.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.045
Peter, I know
you're humiliated,

06:18.128 --> 06:20.005
but getting drunk
is not the answer.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.841
Uh-oh. Either my
esophagus just got shorter,

06:22.925 --> 06:24.468
or I'm about
to throw up.

06:24.551 --> 06:28.388
CROWD: Hey! Ow! Hey!

06:30.516 --> 06:32.226
(vomiting)

06:32.309 --> 06:33.519
Peter, that was amazing.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.188
I've never seen a
guy your size who could move like that.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.815
How would you like
to play for the New England Patriots?

06:38.899 --> 06:41.401
PETER:
Oh. I'd love to.

06:41.485 --> 06:42.778
Say, listen, uh, Tom,

06:42.861 --> 06:43.862
could you get
me a towel?

06:43.946 --> 06:45.864
-I threw up
on the floor. -Sure.

06:45.948 --> 06:47.574
And could you also get
another towel?

06:47.658 --> 06:50.077
I also threw up
on this gentleman's bare lap.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.161
MAN: Could you
wet the towel?

06:51.245 --> 06:52.371
PETER: Wet the
towel, Tom?

06:56.250 --> 06:57.251
For our top
story tonight,

06:57.334 --> 06:59.586
we go live to terrific
haircut Bob Costas

06:59.670 --> 07:01.588
as he talks with
local man Peter Griffin,

07:01.672 --> 07:02.756
who is living his dream

07:02.840 --> 07:04.633
of playing for the
New England Patriots.

07:04.716 --> 07:05.717
-Bob?
-Thanks, Tom.

07:05.801 --> 07:06.927
I'm fond of your hair,
as well.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.512
I'm standing here
with Tom Brady

07:08.595 --> 07:10.597
and his newest teammate,
Peter Griffin.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.266
Hey, Ma! Check it out!

07:12.349 --> 07:14.142
I'm married to
a pro athlete!

07:14.226 --> 07:15.894
Ha! What do you
think of that?

07:15.978 --> 07:16.979
Ha ha ha!

07:17.104 --> 07:18.605
We're really excited
to have Peter.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.941
I think he's gonna make
a great addition to a great team.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.820
I want to thank God.
Uh, I want to thank the Lord God.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.614
Uh, 'cause it's not
really up to me. It's up to him.

07:27.698 --> 07:30.367
Um, and I want to thank
the devil, too.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.160
Uh, you know,
'cause that's--

07:32.244 --> 07:33.745
uh, that's why
God's there.

07:33.829 --> 07:35.789
He's, uh--
He's minding the fence,

07:35.873 --> 07:38.166
making sure that guy
never comes back.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.459
Uh...

07:39.543 --> 07:40.544
You know, if it
weren't for the devil,

07:40.627 --> 07:42.045
God'd probably
go insane,

07:42.129 --> 07:44.548
blow his brains out
from boredom, you know?

07:45.382 --> 07:47.718
Everybody likes
to feel useful.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.596
Maketh the world
go round.

07:50.679 --> 07:51.972
Back to you, Tom.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.974
Diane, didn't
your first husband blow his brains out?

07:54.057 --> 07:57.644
Oh, God. (sobs)

07:57.728 --> 08:00.814
Coming up, America's hottest
new curse word, "kleeman."

08:00.898 --> 08:02.316
We'll tell you what
it means after this.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.735
Boy, Lois, I can't
believe this is happening to me.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.445
I'm somebody
now, you know?

08:06.528 --> 08:09.656
I-I-I don't have to
lie to people about my life any more.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.867
Oh, I am so happy
for you, Peter.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.161
What the hell
happened to you?

08:15.370 --> 08:17.539
I, uh, fell
down the stairs.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.249
Oh, you should
be more careful.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.795
All right, I'm ready.
Come on, good game.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.881
Good game, everybody.
Yeah. Come on, good game.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.175
Let's get out there.
Let's do it. Yeah, yeah.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.511
110%, everybody.
110%. Huh?

08:30.594 --> 08:32.554
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Good game!

08:33.680 --> 08:37.184
Ready! Blue 20,
blue 20! Hut, hut!

08:38.268 --> 08:40.270
-Griffin, let go!
-Let's go?

08:45.442 --> 08:47.569
(crowd cheers)

08:54.535 --> 08:55.744
(gasp)

08:59.790 --> 09:01.625
-Morning.
-Good day to you, sir.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.043
Hey, wait a minute.
What the hell?

09:03.126 --> 09:04.127
(fearful moan)

09:04.211 --> 09:05.712
Aaaaaa!

09:06.964 --> 09:08.799
Ah! Ow!

09:10.592 --> 09:13.512
Getting real tired
of you ducking me, man. Yeah?

09:13.595 --> 09:16.515
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah, getting really tired.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.605
Where's my money?
Where's my money?

09:23.689 --> 09:26.775
Yeah, you got money to
pay for fake mustaches, huh? Yeah.

09:26.859 --> 09:29.278
Yeah, how much you pay
for that fake mustache?

09:29.361 --> 09:30.362
$2.99.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.822
(scream)

09:33.949 --> 09:36.243
Listen, you just
got to give me more tim-- (scream)

09:36.326 --> 09:37.661
Don't make a fool
out of me, man.

09:37.744 --> 09:38.954
Don't make
a fool out of me.

09:39.037 --> 09:42.374
I want my money.
I want my money, man.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.042
Stewie, listen,
this is crazy.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.377
You got... Oh, my God.

09:45.460 --> 09:50.799
(scream)

09:51.967 --> 09:53.510
All right, let's go
to the bank.

09:55.721 --> 09:56.972
Well, I got
to tell you,

09:57.055 --> 09:58.932
this was a delicious
dinner, Mrs. Griffin.

09:59.016 --> 10:00.017
(laughs)

10:00.100 --> 10:02.477
Well, the pleasure is
all ours, Mr. Brady.

10:02.561 --> 10:03.770
Please, call me Tom.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.731
(squeals and giggles)

10:05.814 --> 10:07.524
Can I call you Tom, too?

10:07.608 --> 10:08.609
Well, of course.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.777
(squeals and giggles)

10:10.861 --> 10:13.822
Mr. Brady,
would you please sign my Trapper Keeper?

10:13.906 --> 10:17.159
Oh, Tom, your shirt.
I'm so sorry.

10:17.242 --> 10:20.329
-Look, you can use our shower if you want.
-No, it's okay.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.414
It's just a little spot.
It'll come out.

10:22.497 --> 10:23.874
Well, that's not
gonna come out.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.292
You better
take a shower.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.086
(water running)

10:28.170 --> 10:29.838
(drill whirs)

10:30.964 --> 10:33.967
-Mom, let me look!
-Meg, stop shoving.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.594
You wouldn't even know
what to do with it.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.763
He's closer to my age,
you cow.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.556
What the hell is this?

10:39.640 --> 10:40.849
Oh, hi, Stewie.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.100
W-We were just leaving.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.519
I say, what the devil is
all the fuss about?

10:43.602 --> 10:47.272
I don't get it.
What's in there? Bing, bong! Hello!

10:48.815 --> 10:50.526
Hey. What's going on?

10:50.609 --> 10:51.985
What the hell?
Get out of here!

10:52.069 --> 10:54.071
What? We're on
the same team. We shower together.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.364
Yeah, in the
locker room!

10:55.447 --> 10:56.865
Yeah, yeah,
come here, you.

10:56.949 --> 10:58.367
Stop it. Knock it off.
What, are you crazy?

10:58.450 --> 11:00.494
We're just a couple
of guys messing around.

11:00.577 --> 11:01.578
That's what we are.

11:02.913 --> 11:05.374
Oh, oh, quiet,
everybody, my commercial's on.

11:05.457 --> 11:06.959
Hi, I'm Peter Griffin

11:07.042 --> 11:08.377
of the New
England Patriots.

11:08.460 --> 11:12.422
I'm here to kick off
the Touchdown of Savings weekend

11:12.506 --> 11:14.508
at Wilkins Hyundai
and Subaru.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.552
We will blitz the
competition,

11:16.635 --> 11:17.803
and in no time,

11:17.886 --> 11:20.681
you'll be driving your
new Hyundai or Subaru

11:20.764 --> 11:23.016
right to a touchdown.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.896
PETER:At Wilkins
Hyundai and Subaru

11:27.980 --> 11:31.108
We have Hyundais
and Subarus

11:33.068 --> 11:36.280
Mom, the game's
about to start. Where's Dad?

11:36.363 --> 11:39.032
I don't know, Chris.
And I'm starting to get worried.

11:39.116 --> 11:41.994
I think all this
success might be going to his head.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.913
Do you know he
spent $30,000 on a wax sculpture

11:44.997 --> 11:47.499
of Harriet Tubman
doing Gwyneth Paltrow?

11:47.583 --> 11:51.837
Yeah. Yeah,
that is happening for real.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.255
Yeah.

11:54.173 --> 11:55.924
I'll enjoy that
more tomorrow.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.051
Where the hell
is Griffin?

11:58.135 --> 11:59.344
It's almost time
for kickoff.

11:59.428 --> 12:01.722
Well, I guess we have
to start without him.

12:07.019 --> 12:10.647
What do you think, huh? I got this
for doing that car dealership ad.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.275
All right, enough
messing around. Huh? Let's play this game.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.152
Let's play some
football.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.779
Griffin, I'm getting
really tired of your cocky attitude.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.907
How many times
have I told you, no showboating?

12:19.990 --> 12:21.909
Relax, Tom, I'm just
having a little fun.

12:21.992 --> 12:23.493
I got it under control.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.913
Okay, 28-Z right,
pitch left,

12:25.996 --> 12:28.790
on one, on one.
Ready? Break!

12:28.874 --> 12:33.045
Ready, green 54!
Green 54! Set, hut, hut!

12:41.553 --> 12:42.721
Yeah!

12:42.804 --> 12:45.516
Huh. There might
be some hope for this guy after all.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.725
Yeah.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.354
Damn it, Griffin!
I said no showboating!

12:50.437 --> 12:52.898
This calls for
a victory tune!

12:52.981 --> 12:56.151
(showtune jazz playing)

12:56.235 --> 12:58.028
Now a woman
who'll kiss on a very first date

12:58.111 --> 12:59.655
Is usually a hussy

12:59.738 --> 13:01.365
And a woman
who'll kiss on the second time out

13:01.448 --> 13:02.824
Is anything
but fussy

13:02.908 --> 13:05.035
But a woman
who'll wait till the third time around

13:05.118 --> 13:06.912
Head in the clouds,
feet on the ground

13:06.995 --> 13:08.747
She's the girl
he's glad he's found

13:08.830 --> 13:10.165
She's his shipoopi

13:10.249 --> 13:12.918
Shipoopi, shipoopi,
shipoopi

13:13.001 --> 13:14.461
CROWD:
The girl who's hard to get

13:14.545 --> 13:17.047
Shipoopi, shipoopi,
shipoopi

13:17.130 --> 13:18.715
CHEERLEADERS:
But you can win her yet

13:18.799 --> 13:20.717
Walk around once,
just to raise the curtain

13:20.801 --> 13:22.803
Walk around twice
and you're made for certain

13:22.886 --> 13:24.221
Once more
in the flower garden

13:24.304 --> 13:26.640
She will never
get sore if you beg her pardon

13:28.183 --> 13:29.935
Do, re, mi, fa,
so, la, si, do

13:30.018 --> 13:31.353
si, la, so,
fa, mi, re, do

13:31.436 --> 13:33.063
Squeeze her once
when she isn't looking

13:33.146 --> 13:35.065
Get a squeeze back,
that's fancy cooking

13:35.148 --> 13:36.525
Once more for
a pepper upper

13:36.608 --> 13:38.652
She will never
get sore on the way to supper

13:40.445 --> 13:43.323
Do, re, mi, fa, so,
la, si, do, si, do

13:43.407 --> 13:47.286
Now little old Sal
was a no-gal as anyone could see

13:47.369 --> 13:50.289
Look at her now,
she's a go-gal who only goes for me

13:50.372 --> 13:52.541
Squeeze her once
when she isn't looking

13:52.624 --> 13:54.418
Get a squeeze back,
that's fancy cooking

13:54.501 --> 13:56.086
Once more for
a pepper upper

13:56.170 --> 13:57.963
She will never
get sore on the way to supper

13:58.046 --> 14:01.175
Do, re, mi, fa, so,
la, si, do, si, do

14:01.258 --> 14:03.886
Shipoopi, shipoopi,
shipoopi

14:03.969 --> 14:05.387
CROWD:
The girl who's hard to get

14:05.470 --> 14:08.140
Shipoopi, shipoopi,

14:08.223 --> 14:10.475
CHEERLEADERS:
But you can win her yet

14:10.559 --> 14:14.062
(showtune jazz)

14:29.286 --> 14:31.413
No! No!

14:54.978 --> 14:57.147
ALL:
Shipoopi, shipoopi, shipoopi

14:57.231 --> 14:58.774
The girl who's
hard to get

14:58.857 --> 15:01.360
Shipoopi, shipoopi,
shipoopi

15:01.443 --> 15:03.278
But you can
win her yet

15:03.362 --> 15:06.740
(emphatically)
You can win her

15:06.823 --> 15:10.369
Yet

15:10.452 --> 15:12.621
Shipoopi!

15:12.704 --> 15:15.832
All right.
I made a touchdown.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.918
Griffin, you're fired!

15:18.001 --> 15:19.002
For what?

15:19.086 --> 15:20.379
We've had it
with your crap.

15:20.462 --> 15:21.505
I talked to the coach,

15:21.588 --> 15:23.257
and he's selling
your contract to another team.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.967
And the only
one that'll take

15:25.050 --> 15:26.760
you is the worst
football team in Europe,

15:26.844 --> 15:28.637
the London
Silly Nannies.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.727
So, Brian,
we're even now, right?

15:35.811 --> 15:37.479
Ready to start
a new life in England.

15:37.563 --> 15:39.940
I've got my money.
Your wounds have healed up nicely.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.025
What do you say we let
bygones be bygones? Hmm?

15:42.109 --> 15:44.027
You shot me in
both my knees,

15:44.111 --> 15:46.113
then lit me on
fire. Piss off.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.948
All right, all right.
I tell you what,

15:48.031 --> 15:50.200
you get one free
revenge shot at me.

15:50.284 --> 15:53.078
Okay. But I'm not
gonna tell you when it's coming.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.706
-(grunts)
-(screams)

15:57.040 --> 15:58.041
-(grunts)
-(screams)

15:58.125 --> 15:59.710
Ah, this is
gonna be fun.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.420
Peter, this is crazy.

16:01.503 --> 16:04.715
Isn't there any way the Patriots
could let you back on the team?

16:04.798 --> 16:06.550
No, they said the
decision was final.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.552
It's all right,
Lois. I can make the best of this.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.305
I mean,
a British football team can't be that bad.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.058
Uh, excuse me.
Hey, there. Hi.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.311
I'm, uh, Peter Griffin.
I'm your new player.

16:17.394 --> 16:19.897
Oh, yes, Peter.
Welcome to the Silly Nannies.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.315
I'm the quarterback,
Lesley.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.441
This is our team.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.193
(showtune music playing)

16:25.611 --> 16:26.904
If you'll marry me

16:26.987 --> 16:28.155
I'll dig for you
and rake for you

16:28.238 --> 16:29.573
If you'll marry me

16:29.656 --> 16:31.074
I'll scrub for you
and bake for you

16:31.158 --> 16:32.409
If you'll marry me

16:32.492 --> 16:34.077
All others
I'll forsake for you

16:34.161 --> 16:37.247
All this will I do
if you'll marry me

16:37.331 --> 16:40.792
All this will I do
if you'll marry me

16:40.876 --> 16:42.419
Oh, crap.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.011
Well, I guess living
in a London flat

16:51.094 --> 16:52.679
isn't gonna
be too bad, huh?

16:52.763 --> 16:54.681
Mom, there's no water
in the toilet.

16:54.765 --> 16:57.184
First of all, Chris,
it's called a loo.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.644
Second, there's
no water in it,

16:58.727 --> 17:01.355
because everybody
here just uses Elizabeth Hurley.

17:01.438 --> 17:02.439
All right, well,
where is she?

17:02.523 --> 17:04.316
'Cause I need her now!

17:05.442 --> 17:07.402
MALE TV HOST: You're
watching BBC FOUR.

17:07.486 --> 17:09.863
Previously on
Condensation.

17:09.947 --> 17:11.198
Ellen, there's moisture

17:11.281 --> 17:13.033
on the outside
of my glass.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.202
It's condensation,
Johnny.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.454
But what about the fog
on the windows?

17:17.538 --> 17:19.498
It's not fog, Johnny.

17:19.581 --> 17:22.292
It, too, is called
condensation.

17:22.376 --> 17:27.047
"Con-den-sation."
(echoes)

17:27.130 --> 17:28.882
Hey, Peter, how
was your first

17:28.966 --> 17:30.175
Silly Nannies practice?

17:30.259 --> 17:31.635
It sucked, Lois.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.263
Those Silly Nannies are
just a bunch of losers.

17:34.346 --> 17:35.681
Pack your bags.
We're going home.

17:35.764 --> 17:37.099
What, you're just
giving up?

17:37.182 --> 17:39.059
Look, Peter, I know
you're upset

17:39.142 --> 17:40.686
because you blew
your opportunity

17:40.769 --> 17:41.770
with the Patriots.

17:41.854 --> 17:44.982
But this is your chance
to redeem yourself.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.525
Now, I bet
if you really tried,

17:46.608 --> 17:48.235
you could turn
that team around.

17:48.318 --> 17:49.695
You know what, Lois?

17:49.778 --> 17:52.531
When you were talking
about that sale at TJ Maxx just now,

17:52.614 --> 17:53.866
I came up with an idea.

17:53.949 --> 17:56.326
I am going to turn
that team around.

17:56.410 --> 17:57.828
And we'll challenge
the Patriots

17:57.911 --> 18:00.080
to a game, and we'll
kick their ass!

18:02.541 --> 18:04.543
Oh, man, what
an attractive woman.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.211
-(phone rings)
-Hello?

18:06.295 --> 18:07.921
Hey, Brady, you're dead!

18:08.005 --> 18:10.924
Listen, Leno,
you keep calling here and threatening me,

18:11.008 --> 18:12.176
I'm gonna notify
the police.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.303
Leno? No, no,
this is Peter Griffin.

18:14.386 --> 18:16.889
I'm calling to challenge
you to a grudge match

18:16.972 --> 18:17.973
between the Patriots

18:18.056 --> 18:19.266
and the London
Silly Nannies.

18:19.349 --> 18:22.895
Huh. Well, Griffin, if you want
to embarrass yourself, be my guest.

18:22.978 --> 18:26.190
Good. What do
you say, England? Two weeks from now?

18:26.273 --> 18:27.482
See you there.

18:27.566 --> 18:29.610
-(phone rings)
-Hello?

18:29.693 --> 18:31.195
Hey, Brady! What
kind of suit

18:31.278 --> 18:34.072
do you want to be
buried in? Ha ha ha.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.789
Oh, you kids are
gonna love this.

18:42.873 --> 18:45.751
England has such
a rich heritage of great theater.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.211
(polite applause)

18:47.294 --> 18:49.213
Cramsat on the bingum
with the gam gum?

18:49.296 --> 18:51.340
Treaches on the upper
with the trang sang.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.633
(laughter)

18:52.716 --> 18:54.843
Croppers to you,
you crang sang lover.

18:54.927 --> 18:56.053
CROWD: Ooooh!

18:56.136 --> 18:57.888
A-ha ha ha!

18:57.971 --> 18:59.598
She rogered
the boogley!

18:59.681 --> 19:00.849
Ha ha ha!

19:02.893 --> 19:03.894
All right, now
listen up,

19:03.977 --> 19:05.062
you limey bum sniffers.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.439
If we're gonna beat
the New England Patriots next week,

19:07.523 --> 19:08.899
I got to toughen you up.

19:08.982 --> 19:09.983
So you're gonna
get in shape

19:10.067 --> 19:11.818
the way American
athletes do,

19:11.902 --> 19:13.654
by taking steroids.

19:13.737 --> 19:14.738
I say, Jenkins,

19:14.821 --> 19:16.865
you give me that dirty
look one more time,

19:16.949 --> 19:18.951
and I've a good mind
to get into my PJ's

19:19.034 --> 19:20.160
and have a pillow
fight with you.

19:20.244 --> 19:21.995
Very well, then.
En garde!

19:22.079 --> 19:23.997
(clamoring)

19:24.081 --> 19:25.916
-I like your gown.
-I like yours.

19:33.715 --> 19:36.301
Aaaaagh! When's
the beating gonna come, Brian?

19:36.385 --> 19:37.469
Just tell me
when it's gonna come!

19:37.553 --> 19:38.804
Just do something,
anything!

19:38.887 --> 19:40.639
Look, look, I-I'll do
it. I'll do it first.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.100
Look, look,
I'll do it even worse.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.644
Oh, oh!
Look how hurt I am.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.813
(laughing anxiously)
We're even now!

19:53.277 --> 19:54.570
You're going
down, Brady!

19:54.653 --> 19:56.446
You're the one who's
going down, Griffin!

19:56.530 --> 19:58.073
Ow! What the hell?

19:58.156 --> 19:59.783
Ha ha ha ha.

20:02.119 --> 20:03.120
(whistle tweets)

20:04.663 --> 20:05.664
(rumbling)

20:05.747 --> 20:08.458
Those men are
tremendous in stature.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.043
And they're coming
straight at us!

20:10.127 --> 20:11.128
Oh!

20:11.211 --> 20:12.212
(rumbling)

20:12.296 --> 20:14.047
(yelling in fear)

20:14.131 --> 20:16.049
We'll take my carriage.

20:18.719 --> 20:19.720
Oh, crap!

20:19.803 --> 20:22.055
Well, I'm still here,
you bastards,

20:22.139 --> 20:23.765
so let's do this.

20:26.852 --> 20:28.020
(referee whistle)

20:29.605 --> 20:33.317
Oh, hey, Brady, you're gonna gloat
and call me a loser now?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.235
Actually, Peter, you're
not a loser at all.

20:35.319 --> 20:37.404
What you did just now
was pretty ballsy.

20:37.487 --> 20:39.072
-Really?
-Absolutely!

20:39.156 --> 20:43.076
For one guy to stand up
to the entire New England Patriots team,

20:43.160 --> 20:44.745
that's a winner
in my book.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.164
(dinging)

20:47.247 --> 20:49.458
Wow. Thanks, Tom Brady.

20:50.501 --> 20:53.128
-Peter! Oh, my God, are you all right?
-Yeah.

20:53.212 --> 20:55.047
-Can you move your legs?
-Yeah!

20:55.130 --> 20:56.298
Oh, good.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.091
I thought you were gonna
be a vegetable,

20:58.175 --> 20:59.551
and I gotta tell you,
Peter,

20:59.635 --> 21:02.262
I-I-I just don't think
I have it in me.

21:02.346 --> 21:04.431
I mean,
if you can't move, it's over.

21:04.515 --> 21:06.308
I love you, too, honey.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.018
Let's go home.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.858
(whack)

21:19.363 --> 21:21.532
(theme music playing)
