WEBVTT

00:03.571 --> 00:06.274
Hey, what's up,
my little chickens?

00:06.307 --> 00:07.475
-Hey.
-Hey, Dad.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.743
Whoa. What is that noise?

00:09.777 --> 00:12.146
-Jack. He's practicing.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.982
Seriously? Do you not know
Jack plays an instrument?

00:15.015 --> 00:17.785
Of course I know.
I'm his dad. Okay?

00:17.818 --> 00:20.121
Really

00:20.154 --> 00:21.422
You know what?

00:21.455 --> 00:23.724
I'm not even gonna dignify that
with a response.

00:23.757 --> 00:24.925
I know what instrument
my son plays.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.260
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't look in there.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.796
I wasn't looking.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.464
Okay, well, then,
tell me what instrument.

00:30.498 --> 00:33.534
You know, I do not appreciate
being tested in my own home.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.769
I know everything that
goes on in here, okay?

00:35.803 --> 00:37.538
Just finished my oboe lesson.
Going upstairs.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.707
The oboe.
Jack plays the oboe.

00:39.740 --> 00:44.912
* I am not your ordinary guy

00:44.945 --> 00:48.482
All right.
Download me.

00:48.516 --> 00:53.621
Okay, so, Alviti assigned us
six parking lots...

00:53.654 --> 00:56.023
-Mm.
-...which is a ton of work.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.359
But I got Mott and Goody
helping us out,

00:58.392 --> 01:00.161
so that should
cover most of it.

01:00.194 --> 01:03.831
And we're gonna be, um,
spread a little thin.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.299
Uh...

01:05.333 --> 01:07.901
but I think if everyone
brings their "A" game,

01:07.935 --> 01:09.337
we should be fine.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.671
Who is this? Hello.

01:11.705 --> 01:14.375
One -- One -- One --
One second.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.177
What color did I say
I wanted my coffee?

01:16.210 --> 01:18.346
Uh, you said the color
of a camel hump.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.513
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.549
Remember I said a
shaved camel hump, right?

01:21.582 --> 01:22.916
Yes, you're right.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.352
'Cause it would be
a little lighter than --

01:24.385 --> 01:25.953
'Cause, you know, the hump
wouldn't get as much...

01:25.986 --> 01:27.521
-Much sun. Yep, yep. I got that.
-Exactly.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.290
Okay.
I'll just get
some more creamer.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.058
Okay.
All right, cool.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.894
Ohh! Okay. Eh.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.297
It's a debacle.
Hold on a second.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.501
Can you toast that up for me
and give it a kiss of butter?

01:40.534 --> 01:42.470
Okay, and -- and by "kiss,"
I mean let them make out.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.938
-Just let them get in there.
-Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.574
All right.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.811
I'm eating a scone. Used to
make fun of these people.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.913
Like, "Look at me.
I'm eating a scone."

01:52.946 --> 01:54.782
But look at me.
I'm eating a scone.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.185
I'm talking about the guy.
Who's the guy?

01:57.218 --> 01:59.720
Oh. That's Tyler. He's my,
uh, personal assistant.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.021
I can't believe you.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.723
We just start making
money as a company,

02:02.756 --> 02:05.226
and you go out and hire yourself
a personal assistant?!

02:05.259 --> 02:07.528
It's called
planning for success.

02:08.629 --> 02:12.032
So, if you give me
the loan to buy Enzo's,

02:12.065 --> 02:13.601
my plan is simple --

02:13.634 --> 02:15.769
a more contemporary menu,

02:15.803 --> 02:17.638
microbrews from
around the world,

02:17.671 --> 02:22.576
and low-flow toilets
that actually flush.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.645
Thoughts?
And you can go first, Jack.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.180
What? Oh, sorry.

02:26.214 --> 02:29.016
I was trying to suck the jelly
out of my Pop-Tart.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.718
Oh, come on!
I had to sit through

02:30.751 --> 02:33.587
your boring Abe Lincoln
school report.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.423
Okay, Sara.
Any thoughts?

02:35.456 --> 02:37.691
-Actually, I have a question.
-Okay.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.393
Did you know there was something
stuck between your teeth

02:39.427 --> 02:40.561
when you started talking?

02:41.662 --> 02:43.231
Hey. What are you guys
still doing here?

02:43.264 --> 02:45.999
You're gonna miss the bus.
Go. Go, go, go!

02:46.033 --> 02:48.502
Geez. Uh, what are you doing
holding them up?

02:48.536 --> 02:51.004
I was telling them
about my business plan!

02:54.508 --> 02:55.709
Business plan?

02:55.743 --> 02:56.910
Yeah, look, um...

02:56.944 --> 02:58.579
If Alviti buys Enzo's,

02:58.612 --> 03:00.548
he's just gonna turn it
into a parking lot.

03:00.581 --> 03:03.784
So, I had a brainstorm,
and...

03:03.817 --> 03:06.053
we buy it.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.121
Ta-da!

03:08.155 --> 03:11.392
No. Are you crazy?
We cannot buy Enzo's.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.693
Why not?!

03:12.726 --> 03:14.295
Because we don't have
any money

03:14.328 --> 03:16.163
and our credit score
is two digits!

03:16.196 --> 03:19.433
Yes, uh, granted, on paper,
it makes no sense.

03:19.467 --> 03:23.203
But I have a business plan and
I have a really good concept.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.838
Trust me.
I can make this work.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.207
Look, I love that you are trying
to make something happen,

03:27.241 --> 03:29.577
but there's just no way
we can do this, okay?

03:29.610 --> 03:31.044
Now I have to get to class,

03:31.078 --> 03:32.780
a class that we can't pay for,
by the way.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.583
Also, you got a thing
stuck in your teeth.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.090
Can I help you?

03:43.123 --> 03:44.458
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

03:44.492 --> 03:45.626
You must be Rootger.

03:45.659 --> 03:46.927
I'm Tyler,
Mr. G's new assistant.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.597
Really?
I didn't know about this.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.965
Yeah, well, he said
things were getting
busy around here, so...

03:51.999 --> 03:55.002
I know how things are getting.
I work here.

03:55.035 --> 03:57.505
Anyway, he said he needs me
to be his eyes and ears.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.573
And what am I?
His nose and teeth?

03:59.607 --> 04:02.810
I don't know
how to answer that.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.913
Okay, so you have a personal
assistant, which is insane,

04:05.946 --> 04:07.781
but I -- I don't have time
to get into it, okay?

04:07.815 --> 04:09.517
I just need to go over
the two things

04:09.550 --> 04:10.718
that you need
to do today, okay?

04:10.751 --> 04:11.919
Ready.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.421
All right,
so, first thing,

04:13.454 --> 04:16.023
I need you to deposit the Alviti
check into our business account

04:16.056 --> 04:17.591
so checks
don't start bouncing.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.259
Very important
that it's done today.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.729
-Filed away. Go.
-Okay.

04:21.762 --> 04:25.299
Next thing, I need you to go
to the Jericho lot at 4:00

04:25.333 --> 04:26.667
and make sure that
it's secured, okay?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.969
Oh, you know what else
I could do while I'm there --

04:29.002 --> 04:31.204
is I could check every level
of the structure,

04:31.238 --> 04:32.706
do a sweep,
make a report.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.808
No sweeping, no reporting.
Just lock it down.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.444
4:00. What did I say?

04:36.477 --> 04:38.078
-4:00. Got it. All right.
-Okay, good.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.047
So, I got to go drop
the boys off in Syosset,

04:40.080 --> 04:41.582
and then
I got to go to Queens

04:41.615 --> 04:43.216
to meet the people
who are doing our uniforms.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.686
Hey. Listen. Can you see
if they can make, like,
a wrinkle

04:45.719 --> 04:47.388
-Nope!
-Okay, yeah, 'cause we're busy.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.789
We got stuff going on.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.290
Yo, Tyler, we got to
hit the bank,

04:50.324 --> 04:51.859
so you got to make
that bagel to go, okay?

04:51.892 --> 04:54.094
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. What
are you

04:54.127 --> 04:56.430
I was just gonna throw out
the seeds and stuff.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.499
Oof. That's the
wrong plan, Joanne.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.001
Okay, yeah, uh...
It's an everything bagel.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.837
In your hand right there,
that is everything.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.673
It's the jewels
of the bagel.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.975
Yes. Garlic, onion.
The flavor.

05:08.008 --> 05:11.044
Without it, it's just
a circle of stupid dough.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.880
I-I tried to
sprinkle it on there,

05:12.913 --> 05:14.081
you know, but it just
kind of falls off again.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.549
-This guy.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.685
Yeah, you know why? 'Cause it's
a dry surface and you can't --

05:17.718 --> 05:19.019
It's gonna bounce.
Watch this.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.554
-Oh, okay.
-You got to get it to stick.

05:20.588 --> 05:21.789
-Open it up...
-Uh-huh.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.991
...and now
sprinkle on top.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.193
Let the butter
act like the glue.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.962
I thought this was common sense,
but whatever.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.230
Here you go, boss.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.499
-Thank you.
-All set.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.667
Is he all set? 'Cause
he might need a napkin.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.035
Ooh, kid's got a point.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.137
I don't want buttery fingers
on the wheel when I'm driving.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.506
I would've thought of that.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.040
Yeah, but you didn't.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.744
If you need a personal
assistant, it should be me.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.245
He should be
answering the phones.

05:45.278 --> 05:48.048
Oh, really? I-I would do that,
except isn't that your job?

05:48.081 --> 05:50.884
Hey, anything this guy can do,
I can do better.

05:50.918 --> 05:54.555
I don't think so, pal, 'cause
I'm a part-time meteorologist.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.723
No, you're not.

05:55.756 --> 05:56.790
Yes, I am. I'm saving up
for a Doppler.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.959
Well, I hope you're better
at predicting the weather

05:58.992 --> 06:00.193
than making bagels.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.762
Ohh! We're back
on the bagel thing!

06:01.795 --> 06:03.163
Yeah, we're back
on the bagel thing.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.765
Guys, guys, guys, stop
the fighting, all right?

06:04.798 --> 06:06.667
Listen. Business
is booming here.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.103
I-I got to be operating
at peak performance.

06:10.137 --> 06:13.340
I get it -- you both want
to be my personal assistant,

06:13.373 --> 06:15.142
but here's the kicker --

06:15.175 --> 06:17.545
there can only be one.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.647
Oh, finally! Hello.
I got a person.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.049
Okay, yes, hi! I am calling
about our uniforms.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.217
Um, they were supposed to say
"Monkey Fist," but instead

06:24.251 --> 06:26.520
they say "Monkey Cyst,"
so that's a problem.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.889
Um,
and I should say this --

06:28.922 --> 06:33.794
if you put me on hold, I will
track you down and kill you.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.095
Hello?

06:36.464 --> 06:39.800
All right. I brought you
into my kitchen for phase one --

06:39.833 --> 06:41.902
getting to know Kevin Gable.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.505
Let's start at the beginning.
It's 6:00 a.m.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.840
I wake up, I've said my prayers,
I go to the gym, I come back.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.008
What do I do next?

06:48.041 --> 06:49.710
Wait. You go to the gym
in the morning?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.645
No, I do not.
Good catch, Rootger.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.514
Yes.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.015
New scenario.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.284
It's 10:00 p.m.
I want pizza.

06:57.317 --> 07:00.588
Enzo's is closed.
What happens next?

07:00.621 --> 07:02.355
No problem.
I go to the grocery store,

07:02.389 --> 07:04.124
I buy the ingredients,
I make you a pizza.

07:04.157 --> 07:07.427
N-yewww.

07:07.461 --> 07:08.762
What do you got?

07:08.796 --> 07:11.532
I drive to Enzo's house,
I pull him out of bed,

07:11.565 --> 07:13.901
and tell him,
"Hey, make a pizza."

07:13.934 --> 07:15.769
I like it.
Problem solving.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.204
All right, let's roll up
our sleeves, boys,

07:17.237 --> 07:19.507
'cause we're about to take this
elevator to the next level.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.510
Welcome to phase two!

07:22.543 --> 07:25.746
The way a man folds laundry
is the way he lives his life.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.780
Corners, corners!

07:33.053 --> 07:36.790
Ugh! With this traffic, I am
never gonna make this meeting!

07:36.824 --> 07:38.692
Well, just call Kev.
Can't he do it?

07:38.726 --> 07:40.494
No. He's got
his hands full.

07:40.528 --> 07:43.130
All right, you boys are
gonna book me a trip, okay?

07:43.163 --> 07:44.832
Now, I look for three
things when I travel --

07:44.865 --> 07:47.300
comfort, efficiency,

07:47.334 --> 07:49.837
and those nuts with the,
uh, little dust on the
outside, the sugary --

07:49.870 --> 07:51.572
-Yes, those are them.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.440
By the way, give yourself
3 points for that, Tyler.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.009
-Yeah, I guess we are. Yeah.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.979
All right. Now, it's
Thanksgiving weekend.

07:59.012 --> 08:02.683
I am traveling to Dubai to
meet with the emperor of...

08:04.117 --> 08:06.219
Let's go with Dubai.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.788
Hold on,.
You know the emperor?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.523
No, I do not, but it's
none of your business,

08:09.557 --> 08:10.791
so minus 2 points
for questioning me.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.259
Crap!

08:12.292 --> 08:13.794
Now, is this trip
business or pleasure?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.162
Hm. Good question.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.230
It's a little bit of both,
because, uh, me and the emperor

08:17.264 --> 08:19.967
are gonna have a couple
beers, and then we're
gonna get some stuff done.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.573
Okay.
Your time starts...

08:25.606 --> 08:27.908
now.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.680
Hey, Chale.
How's it going?

08:32.713 --> 08:35.348
Actually, I'm not having
the best of days, Mr. Gable.

08:35.382 --> 08:37.217
Yeah, sometimes
it goes like that.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.419
Kendra and I are
having a disagreement.

08:39.452 --> 08:40.754
I don't know what it is.

08:40.788 --> 08:43.056
It's just e-every time
I really want something,

08:43.090 --> 08:44.592
I just --
I can't seem to get it.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.994
I don't know. I-I'm just --
I'm not bold enough or...

08:47.027 --> 08:48.629
Yeah.
You know what it is?

08:48.662 --> 08:51.599
You got to really just
work these things out
on your own, you know?

08:51.632 --> 08:53.767
But you're like a lion!
You always get what you want.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.336
It's a mind-set, Chale.
It's a...

08:56.369 --> 08:57.671
It's a way of life.

08:57.705 --> 08:58.806
Most people are out there,

08:58.839 --> 09:00.674
they're distracted
by the tall grass.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.075
I'm focused.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.712
I'm ready for my next kill.
That's what I'm doing.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.747
-Right.
-Yeah, I spot my gazelle.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.716
Do I waste time?
I don't.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.918
I pounce on it,
then I drag it to a tree.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.053
Do I eat it now?
I don't know.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.356
Do I eat it later?
Whenever I want. You know why?

09:16.389 --> 09:19.192
King of the jungle.
I get what I want.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.061
Hope that helps.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.462
It did. It really did.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.397
You got something in
your...right there.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.099
I

09:26.133 --> 09:27.701
All right, fellas,
what do we got?

09:27.735 --> 09:30.838
Okay, I got you connecting
through London.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.674
There's a four-hour layover,
but there's an aquarium

09:33.707 --> 09:36.844
very close by with
a brand-new baby beluga.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.112
His name is Bubbles,
and he's adorable.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.382
Pre-planned fun.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.784
I like it.
Give yourself a point.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.753
Wow. That sounds
really great and all.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.855
All I could find was a direct
flight, business-class,

09:47.888 --> 09:49.757
with the seats that go
completely flat.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.491
Those are sick!
I love those!

09:51.524 --> 09:54.161
Give yourself 3 -- 4 points.
You get 4 points for that.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.764
Okay. You know what?
That was the easy stuff.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.265
Let's take it
to the next phase

09:58.298 --> 10:01.068
and find out what
you boys are made of.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.837
There's a fire
in Monkey Fist.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.706
My old football knee
is acting up.

10:05.739 --> 10:08.341
I can't run out.
What do you do?

10:08.375 --> 10:11.378
I'll pick you up like a puppy
and carry you to safety.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.146
Nice. Tyler?

10:13.180 --> 10:15.983
You know what? I'm just
gonna take 3 points off.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.886
This physical challenge
is about inner strength,

10:18.919 --> 10:22.422
keeping your eye on the prize,
not giving up.

10:24.624 --> 10:28.528
Whoa. 2:00.
How'd that happen?

10:35.368 --> 10:36.704
45 seconds!

10:36.737 --> 10:37.938
This...

10:37.971 --> 10:41.174
This is so much harder
on a full stomach.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.645
I'm home watching the game
after a long day.

10:45.679 --> 10:48.081
Out of nowhere, my sports
package cuts off.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.249
How do you fix it?

10:49.282 --> 10:51.384
I call the cable company
and yell at them

10:51.418 --> 10:53.787
until they re-up you
at the promotional price.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.288
Great.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.457
-Do it.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.226
-Yeah, this one's real.
-Oh.

11:00.928 --> 11:04.732
No. No, no, no. Please
don't put me on hold. No!

11:04.765 --> 11:07.334
You know, you're not supposed to
drive while on the phone.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.836
Oh, okay, well,
then arrest me.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.371
Oh, that's right -- you're not
a cop anymore, so shut it!

11:11.404 --> 11:13.874
Okay, you know what?
I'm never gonna make it in time,

11:13.907 --> 11:15.308
so you guys are just gonna
have to jump out here.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.710
We're like a mile away
from the gig.

11:16.744 --> 11:19.546
Okay, well, just cut through
somebody's lawn. You'll be fine.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.681
That's a long walk.
I'm not wearing my orthotics!

11:21.715 --> 11:23.884
Just go!

11:23.917 --> 11:25.919
You did a hell
of a job, boys,

11:25.953 --> 11:27.921
and there are
no losers here today.

11:27.955 --> 11:30.958
Believe me, I wish I had more
than one envelope, but I don't.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.093
Now, Tyler, you were great.

11:33.126 --> 11:36.764
You know, I mean, you're
young, you're energetic,

11:36.797 --> 11:37.965
but you're also
inexperienced.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.299
I had to factor that in.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.901
Yeah, sure, no.
I-I get that.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.635
Yeah. Now, Rootger...

11:42.669 --> 11:45.839
Believe me, you're
a very trusted employee.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.507
You're solid as a rock.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.542
But have you been
in the game too long?

11:49.576 --> 11:50.577
No.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.980
Okay, these are
rhetorical questions.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.982
I'm kind of just
throwing it out there.

11:55.015 --> 11:55.949
Okay?

11:55.983 --> 11:59.219
All right, now, this is
not an easy decision,

11:59.252 --> 12:02.055
so, Tyler, I'm gonna need you to
go into the kitchen if you would

12:02.089 --> 12:05.392
so I can have a moment
with Rootger, you know? Okay.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.895
-Oh, you're serious.
-Very serious.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.931
The
anticipation is killing me.

12:10.964 --> 12:15.202
Rootger, now, you know I think
the world of you, right?

12:15.235 --> 12:17.270
All right, because
then I-I'm just gonna

12:17.304 --> 12:18.872
rip the Band-Aid right off
and let you --

12:18.906 --> 12:20.340
You know what, man?!
This is stupid!

12:20.373 --> 12:21.641
What are you
talking about?

12:21.674 --> 12:23.143
Okay, I'm out of here.
I don't even want this job.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.312
What
T-Today was just a hard day.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.914
That was a crazy day.
This is not, like, every day.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.415
This doesn't happen
all the time at all.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.250
No, no, there's not
gonna be any days, okay?

12:30.283 --> 12:31.952
You got me doing planks.
I got a bad shoulder now.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.421
It's killing me.
We only do them on,
like, once in a while,

12:34.454 --> 12:36.123
just to toughen up to get
warmed up. That's all.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.991
No, we're not gonna be
doing anything, okay?

12:38.025 --> 12:39.860
I got a degree in microbiology
from Stanford.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.428
And believe me,
I want to use it.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.896
You don't think I want to use
that? I want to use that.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.097
I'm gonna use that?
I'm gonna use that

12:44.131 --> 12:45.532
getting you breakfast
and booking your flights?

12:45.565 --> 12:47.234
No, no, no.
Well, you don't get me
breakfast every day.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.836
We have breakfast
all the time together.
No, no, no-no.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.437
I'll be getting you
breakfast sometimes.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.771
-No. No, you're not.
-Oh, come on.

12:51.805 --> 12:52.940
-Not gonna happen.
-You have no idea.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.741
-Bye. Nope, nope, nope.
-You gotta be -- Tyler!

12:59.412 --> 13:00.848
Congratulations!

13:00.881 --> 13:02.182
-Yes!

13:02.215 --> 13:04.217
Way to go!

13:05.585 --> 13:07.387
Hey. There you are.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.956
What a day!

13:08.989 --> 13:11.992
-Absolutely brutal!
-Ugh. Same.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.962
But thank you so much
for going to the bank.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.264
That was a huge help.
I just need the deposit slip.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.267
Actually never made it
to the bank.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.801
Okay.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.270
So you're telling me

13:23.303 --> 13:26.006
that every check I wrote
today is gonna bounce?

13:26.039 --> 13:28.541
Well, this is one of those
situations that looks bad, huh?

13:30.177 --> 13:32.245
Tell me that you at least

13:32.279 --> 13:34.047
secured the parking lot
in Jericho.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.715
-Please tell me that.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.284
-Let me just explain something.
-Okay.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.888
Ohh! Look.
It's Mr. Alviti.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.023
I guarantee you want that
to go to voicemail.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.958
-Yeah.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.961
Hello. This is Vanessa.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.897
Y-Yes, I, uh --
I know, I know.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.431
-Um...

13:51.464 --> 13:53.934
Could --
If you could j

13:53.967 --> 13:56.937
Okay. We're fired.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.038
I dropped the ball.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.040
Uh, that's --
that's another one on me.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.875
You think so? We had
two things to do today,

14:01.909 --> 14:04.044
and you just lost us
our biggest account

14:04.077 --> 14:07.047
Okay, for now, but I promise you
I will fix it, okay?

14:07.080 --> 14:08.882
I'll go down there, and
I'll get our jobs back!

14:08.916 --> 14:10.383
I mean -- Oh.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.885
See, now, this is what
I'm talking about.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.586
Look at that.
That looks really good.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.455
Get your coat!
We are going.

14:15.488 --> 14:18.225
Okay.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.460
-Nice touch. Look at this.

14:20.493 --> 14:21.494
-Let's go!
-Yes!

14:26.833 --> 14:27.935
Whoa.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.602
Aren't you a little dressed-up
to be making garlic knots?

14:30.803 --> 14:35.042
I'm not making garlic knots.
I am making things happen.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.409
See that guy over there?

14:37.610 --> 14:41.181
He's in charge of business loans
for our credit union.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.049
Oh, no.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.251
Oh, yes.
It is happening.

14:44.284 --> 14:47.387
I am pitching him my idea
for the new Enzo's.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.022
Chale, I don't know
about this.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.223
It is going to work.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.959
Look, you're always telling me
to take the initiative.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.426
That is what I'm doing.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.963
I'm gonna go over there, and
I'm gonna take this deal down.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.265
I am a lion, baby!

14:59.766 --> 15:01.468
I'm not a lion baby.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.837
I'm the f-- I'm --
I'm a fully grown lion.

15:06.173 --> 15:09.176
Okay. Let me handle this,
all right?

15:09.209 --> 15:10.643
Well, hey, wait a second.
We're partners.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.079
I think I should
go in there, too.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.414
Okay, he doesn't
want to see you.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.284
You blew this account!
Could you just stand h--

15:17.317 --> 15:19.686
Just stand here
and read this, okay?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.088
-Fine.
-Okay.

15:21.121 --> 15:25.125
I'll find out what's going on
with...Drake, whoever that is.

15:25.158 --> 15:29.162
If he's anything like the snack
foods, I'm gonna love him.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.133
Knocka, wocka!

15:33.166 --> 15:34.034
What?

15:34.067 --> 15:36.203
Don't you remember?
From

15:36.236 --> 15:39.806
Instead of "knock, knock"
it was "knocka, wocka!"

15:39.839 --> 15:42.509
Ah, the memories are
just flooding back --

15:42.542 --> 15:46.079
making lanyards, tug-of-war,
drinking bug juice.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.915
Good times.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.550
You want your parking lots
back, don't you?

15:50.583 --> 15:54.354
You know, and that is why
you are so successful!

15:54.387 --> 15:55.722
Instinct, intuition,

15:55.755 --> 15:58.691
and I am guessing
a big ol' heart...

15:58.725 --> 16:01.161
of forgiveness.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.163
You left my lots
unattended.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.932
All you had to do was provide
a warm body, and you blew it.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.468
Right, and I -- I don't want
to throw anyone under the bus,

16:08.501 --> 16:11.504
but you do know my partner.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.273
The guy stuffing cookies
in his pockets?

16:13.306 --> 16:17.210
I don't even have to turn around
to say, yes, that guy.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.179
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't trust the security

16:19.212 --> 16:20.980
of my business
to that guy.

16:21.014 --> 16:22.749
Come on.
He was a cop for 20 years.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.418
And although he's a little
rough around the edges,

16:25.452 --> 16:29.056
he's all business when it
counts, I promise you that.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.125
Right now he's rubbing
a magazine on his face.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.800
That I will turn around for.
I will turn around for that.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.073
Okay.

16:46.106 --> 16:49.142
Can't explain that.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.877
All right.
Put it down, dummy!

16:50.910 --> 16:52.679
Put it down. Put it down!

16:52.712 --> 16:55.248
Get out of there.

16:59.286 --> 17:02.289
Has anyone ever told you

17:02.322 --> 17:05.625
that you have
a million

17:05.658 --> 17:07.794
-Not gonna work.
-Okay.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.363
Um, look, ever since
you gave us this account,

17:10.397 --> 17:12.265
our business has tripled,

17:12.299 --> 17:16.469
and although mistakes were made,
mostly by him...

17:16.503 --> 17:19.639
We will get it under control,
I promise.

17:19.672 --> 17:23.076
And we will be the best security
company you've ever hired.

17:23.110 --> 17:27.013
Please. Come on.
Do it for a...fellow camper.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.318
You talk about camp like we were
in Afghanistan together.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.688
Really,
not that big a deal.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.057
Not that big of a deal?
Are you kidding me?

17:38.091 --> 17:41.594
Okay, I think somebody needs
to sing the Camp Apollo song!

17:41.628 --> 17:43.263
No, no, I don't even
remember it.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.898
Yep, yep. I bet you do.
* The...

17:45.932 --> 17:48.335
No, that song is gonna be
stuck in my head all day.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.637
* Friends we make
at camp today *

17:50.670 --> 17:52.805
Together: * Will always
help us find our way *

17:52.839 --> 17:55.074
* 'Cause we're Apollo
through and through *

17:55.108 --> 17:57.377
* We're stuck together
just like glue *

18:01.281 --> 18:03.383
Hey. Hey.
How'd it go?

18:03.416 --> 18:06.219
How did it g--
Look at my face.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.254
I got stomped.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.356
That bad?

18:09.389 --> 18:12.359
No. Worse.
You...

18:12.392 --> 18:13.893
You're 100% right.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.229
Even if we did get the loan,

18:16.263 --> 18:21.434
we would have to pay the down
payment, which is $80,000.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.036
Turns out
I am not a lion.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.839
You're right. You're not.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.375
Oh, thank you very much.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.843
No, no, you are
something better.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.879
You are...

18:32.912 --> 18:35.415
You're a river otter.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.716
Darling, I love you,

18:36.749 --> 18:39.152
but how is that better
than me being a lion?

18:39.186 --> 18:41.254
No, I just watched this
whole special on them.
They're amazing.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.523
They're fast, they're smart,
they're tenacious,

18:43.556 --> 18:45.358
and you don't want
to corner them.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.294
R
-No, they're tough.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.396
And you know
what else they do?

18:49.429 --> 18:51.531
When they sleep, they hook
each other's little arms

18:51.564 --> 18:53.400
so that
they don't float away.

18:53.433 --> 18:56.002
They're always together.
And that's us.

18:56.035 --> 18:58.971
Yeah, I guess.
That is us.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.340
Yeah. You put
two river otters together,

19:00.373 --> 19:02.008
and they will take down
any lion.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.376
Oh, that's not true,
darling.

19:03.410 --> 19:06.145
The lion would eat them
like Skittles.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.248
So you still want to
try to buy this place?

19:08.281 --> 19:10.350
I do.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.718
All right. I'm in.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.387
Fantastic.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.123
What are you doing?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.891
I'm the otter.
It's the otter's arm.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.460
-No.
-We link our arms together.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.262
-Not at work.
-Okay.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.296
I'll just go get changed.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.902
What happened?

19:29.936 --> 19:32.071
She got the account back.
We're good to go.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.840
-Yes!
-Yeah.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.041
You're welcome.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.544
I said "thank you" 50 times
in the car.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.612
-And you're not done yet.
-All right.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.650
Seriously?
I-I know I messed up.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.519
I get distracted.
And...I'm sorry.

19:46.553 --> 19:50.457
From this point on, I promise
you, I will be 100% focused.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.959
Thank you, because I need to
know that I can count on you.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.127
That's the only way
that this is gonna work.

19:55.161 --> 19:56.796
Yes. And y-you,
I'm telling you,

19:56.829 --> 19:58.831
you crushed it today,
so...

19:58.865 --> 20:01.701
I will get you a cup of coffee
because it is well-deserved.

20:01.734 --> 20:02.935
Thank you.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.744
Tyler, you're back!
I-I knew it!

20:11.778 --> 20:13.313
We're gonna work it out!

20:13.346 --> 20:15.282
Actually, I just came by
to pick up my check.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.549
You owe me for today.

20:18.385 --> 20:21.053
Oh, absolutely.
Let me get that for you.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.722
Rootger, you're doing
a great job.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.892
Yes.

20:28.261 --> 20:31.731
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:31.764 --> 20:35.134
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:35.167 --> 20:37.404
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:37.437 --> 20:38.805
* Do, do, do, do

20:38.838 --> 20:42.542
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

20:42.575 --> 20:45.645
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

20:45.678 --> 20:46.679
* I just don't want no...
