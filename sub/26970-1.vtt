with good Saint Nick ♪

02:25.319 --> 02:26.972
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

02:27.016 --> 02:28.626
Ah, mama is here.

02:30.628 --> 02:31.673
-Bye, dad. Butterfly kiss.
-Bye.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.718
Butterfly kiss. Butterfly kiss.

02:38.201 --> 02:41.161
-Mommy!
-Hi, babies!

02:41.204 --> 02:43.554
Mm. Happy Thanksgiving!

02:43.598 --> 02:45.077
Did you guys have a good time?

02:45.121 --> 02:47.689
-We went to Jackie's.
-You went to Jackie's?

02:47.732 --> 02:50.170
-Who's Jackie?
-It's not a person, mom.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.389
It's a place. Jackie's Place.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.086
Jackie's Place.

02:54.130 --> 02:56.176
-Okay.
-Suitcases.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.482
You, you, uh-uh-uh!

02:59.744 --> 03:01.746
Took 'em to Jackie's Place?

03:01.790 --> 03:03.661
You took 'em to a bar?

03:03.705 --> 03:05.054
It was closed.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.708
I just needed
to use the kitchen.

03:06.751 --> 03:09.232
My oven don't fit a turkey.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.321
Jackie's kitchen
has five ovens.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.541
I smashed the potatoes.

03:13.584 --> 03:16.326
These girls
were the biggest help.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.939
-We served pie to everyone.
-Everyone?

03:20.983 --> 03:22.376
Just, you know, some friends,

03:22.419 --> 03:24.508
people that didn't have
any place else to go.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.858
The one with the beard
smelled bad.

03:26.902 --> 03:29.078
And he ate a lot.

03:29.121 --> 03:31.254
Okay, well,
he's livin' in his car

03:31.298 --> 03:33.213
while he's lookin' for a job.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.866
Hm, what did you do?

03:34.910 --> 03:37.129
I worked.

03:37.173 --> 03:38.827
Holidays are double time.

03:38.870 --> 03:41.482
And there's no point
just cooking for me, so...

03:43.179 --> 03:45.486
It's freezing! Let's get you
girls in the car, okay?

03:45.529 --> 03:48.097
-All right, bye, bye, bye, bye.
-In the car. Let's go.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.622
So, um, I'll see you

03:51.666 --> 03:55.104
in a couple of weeks.

03:55.147 --> 03:58.803
Then I guess we'll just do
the usual routine for Christmas.

03:58.847 --> 04:01.893
So I'll take Christmas Eve
and then you'll get the day?

04:01.937 --> 04:03.634
-Great.
-Okay.

04:03.678 --> 04:06.811
So long as they don't mind, you
know, doing the split again.

04:08.204 --> 04:09.814
I mean... Ugh!

04:09.858 --> 04:12.556
Right, yeah. I mean,
it's, you know, it's the plan.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.950
Okay, um...

04:14.993 --> 04:17.735
-Happy Thanksgiving!
-Happy Thanksgiving.

04:20.695 --> 04:24.612
You, um, you look good, Trace.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.614
I mean, you look, you look like
you are doing g...

04:26.657 --> 04:27.919
well, well.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.451
Put your seatbelts on.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.638
Daddy is so handsome.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.379
Isn't he?

04:52.422 --> 04:54.468
And he smells good.

05:02.606 --> 05:06.262
Okay, are we buckled?
Are we ready? Let's do this.

05:13.965 --> 05:16.054
I think
one of your little ladies

05:16.098 --> 05:18.405
left something here
this weekend.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.363
Oh! Pinkie the bear! Oh!

05:20.407 --> 05:22.191
He has been missed.

05:23.845 --> 05:27.196
-Another round.
-Better save up those tips.

05:27.239 --> 05:30.025
I don't know how much longer
I can hold on to this place.

05:30.068 --> 05:31.331
-Come on!
-You know...

05:31.374 --> 05:33.376
I hoped
I'd have a buyer by Christmas.

05:33.420 --> 05:36.292
-I thought you had one.
-They're low-ballin' me.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.556
And they want to turn it
into a TGI Fridays.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.166
Oh, no, absolutely not.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.733
Jackie'd be rolling over
in his grave.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.474
He hated those suspenders.

05:52.961 --> 05:55.093
So I haven't been...

05:55.137 --> 05:56.356
Yoo-hoo!

05:59.750 --> 06:01.448
What are you guys doin'?

06:01.491 --> 06:03.624
Daddy wanted us to make
two wish lists.

06:03.667 --> 06:06.409
-Two?
-One for him and one for you.

06:06.453 --> 06:09.107
So that you wouldn't have
to sort out who's getting what.

06:09.151 --> 06:10.848
Oh, baby,
well, if that's too complicated,

06:10.892 --> 06:12.459
I don't mind
coordinating with him.

06:12.502 --> 06:15.157
What if what we want
takes both of you?

06:15.200 --> 06:17.942
You mean, like, one big gift?

06:22.077 --> 06:26.255
Girls, you know your dad and I
are on limited budget.

06:26.298 --> 06:29.824
And I don't know what he has
said to you, but...

06:29.867 --> 06:33.480
I just don't wanna
make any promises.

06:33.523 --> 06:36.744
We should ask Santa.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.441
Okay, it's your list.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.312
You guys just decide
what you wanna wish for

06:40.356 --> 06:43.664
and I'll, I'll just see
what I can do.

06:45.361 --> 06:47.189
All right, get in your own bed.

06:49.974 --> 06:52.063
Let's get you tucked in.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.326
Get you in.

06:54.370 --> 06:57.417
I love you. Mwah!

06:57.460 --> 06:58.635
You girls know if I could,

06:58.679 --> 07:00.637
I would give you

07:00.681 --> 07:02.465
anything you wish for.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.336
-You promise?
-Yes!

07:04.380 --> 07:07.339
If I could, hundred percent yes.

07:10.952 --> 07:12.127
Ooh!

07:13.128 --> 07:14.738
What's this?

07:16.871 --> 07:19.482
That's Mimi
and Pop Pop's house.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.266
That's us sledding.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.051
Daddy is making the snowman,

07:23.094 --> 07:25.575
and that's you
telling us to be safe.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.751
Mimi and Pop Pop are inside.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.449
Turn it over.

07:32.364 --> 07:35.063
"Our wish is to spend Christmas

07:35.106 --> 07:37.065
with the whole family together

07:37.108 --> 07:39.459
at Mimi and Pop Pop's house.

07:39.502 --> 07:43.071
Must be mom and dad."

07:43.114 --> 07:45.639
We're tired of splitting,
that's the whole reason

07:45.682 --> 07:47.292
you always say
we can't go to the farm.

07:47.336 --> 07:49.469
Which is a really fun place.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.906
Yeah, for you guys.

07:51.949 --> 07:54.517
-That's our wish.
-It doesn't even cost money.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.519
And Mimi will make all the food.

07:56.563 --> 07:59.174
Ooh. Hey, I make good food.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.437
-Yeah, I guess.
-"Yeah, I guess"?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.483
Get in bed, Miss Press.

08:04.614 --> 08:06.007
All right.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.619
I love you.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.360
I love you.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.972
I will...

08:16.321 --> 08:18.323
I'll see what I can do, okay?

08:21.413 --> 08:25.243
Okay, blow out the light.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.594
One, two, three...

08:29.073 --> 08:30.379
All right, door open or closed?

08:30.422 --> 08:31.946
Closed.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.405
-Hi.
-Help you?

08:56.448 --> 08:58.320
Yeah, I'm Tracie.

08:58.363 --> 09:01.366
Is Rick Pruette here or
did he leave something for me?

09:01.410 --> 09:03.107
He's on break.

09:03.151 --> 09:06.110
Oh, is he playing
in the afternoon?

09:06.154 --> 09:07.982
He's working, sweet cakes.

09:08.025 --> 09:10.027
-I'll get him for you.
-Okay.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.507
Hey, Rick?

09:15.119 --> 09:17.382
Pinkie the bear, no longer MIA.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.384
I'm sorry I couldn't get him
over to her last night.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.604
-She sleep okay without him?
-Yeah.

09:21.648 --> 09:25.129
Are you... bartending now?

09:25.173 --> 09:27.218
I'm just,
I'm fillin' in between gigs.

09:27.262 --> 09:30.526
-Misty talked me into it.
-But the band's still playing.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.963
Well, uh...

09:33.007 --> 09:35.792
You know, Chris' wife
has finally had enough.

09:35.836 --> 09:38.621
And, uh, Joe gets
so much session work

09:38.665 --> 09:40.754
that he just, he just don't feel
like being up late anymore,

09:40.797 --> 09:43.321
and, but Randy and I
are still playin'.

09:43.365 --> 09:46.411
We just grab some keys
and a drummer when we need one.

09:46.455 --> 09:49.240
Uh, do you know about this?

09:49.284 --> 09:50.459
I don't.

09:50.502 --> 09:53.027
Well, that's the girls.

09:53.070 --> 09:57.335
That's you, that's me
and that is my mother's house.

09:57.379 --> 10:00.034
They say that's their only
Christmas wish, nothing else.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.907
Oh.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.780
I mean, do you want to spend
Christmas with my mother?

10:06.823 --> 10:08.782
-Well, I--
-'Cause I certainly don't.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.044
-I suspected--
-I mean...

10:10.087 --> 10:11.523
All my sisters
are gonna be there

10:11.567 --> 10:13.438
with their perfect families
and marriages,

10:13.482 --> 10:16.224
and we'll have to celebrate
Steve and Rebecca's anniversary

10:16.267 --> 10:17.878
'cause, of course, they got
married on Christmas to make

10:17.921 --> 10:20.489
everything about them.
Evan got his PhD in Theology.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.360
And I'm sure Garrett
got some amazing promotion,

10:22.404 --> 10:23.884
so he and Beth
are gonna be planning their

10:23.927 --> 10:25.842
big spring vacation
and Maddie made honor roll

10:25.886 --> 10:27.539
and Connor made MVP
of the soccer league

10:27.583 --> 10:29.541
and they were just all there,
already just there

10:29.585 --> 10:32.675
for Thanksgiving. So why do they
have to all go back again?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.634
It's just like a bunch of
perfect people drinking eggnog,

10:34.677 --> 10:38.072
non-alcoholic, and just talking
about Christmas spirit.

10:38.115 --> 10:39.639
Just kind of makes you
wanna jab your eyeballs in

10:39.682 --> 10:41.771
with peppermint sticks.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.643
Yeah, I mean,
that's really vivid,

10:43.686 --> 10:46.428
but I-I mean, it-it sounds like
it'll be a houseful.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.343
Right, I mean,
where are we even gonna stay?

10:48.386 --> 10:50.127
-Yeah.
-It's like... I mean...

10:50.171 --> 10:51.912
Mom will probably put the girls
on blow-up beds somewhere,

10:51.955 --> 10:54.305
and I'm sure I'll just end up
in the basement with teenagers.

10:54.349 --> 10:57.221
But like,
w-what is she gonna do with you?

10:57.265 --> 10:58.745
Yeah, well,
she didn't really know

10:58.788 --> 11:00.355
what to do with me
when we were married.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.313
Yeah, 'cause she hates you.

11:02.357 --> 11:05.360
And now you don't just
play music in a bar,

11:05.403 --> 11:08.580
you work in one!
So that's great.

11:10.887 --> 11:13.977
That's perfect.
She won't want you to come.

11:14.021 --> 11:17.285
So, I don't mind, you know,
but she could say no.

11:17.328 --> 11:18.895
I don't think I agreed to--

11:18.939 --> 11:20.027
Then Mimi's gonna be
the bad guy.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.855
Not us, we don't have to go.

11:21.898 --> 11:23.900
-Thank you. That's it. Okay.
-Oh, oh. Hey, sure.

11:23.944 --> 11:28.035
So I'm gonna call it a night.
And thank you for Pinkie.

11:28.078 --> 11:29.427
Bye!

11:31.125 --> 11:34.302
You can see who they got
their looks from.

11:34.345 --> 11:38.567
-Feisty, too.
-Oh, you haven't met her mom.

11:40.221 --> 11:43.050
♪ Go tell it on the mountain

11:43.093 --> 11:47.968
♪ That Jesus Christ is born

11:48.011 --> 11:51.058
Amen! Whoo!

11:51.101 --> 11:53.277
Oh, I don't know
why I even bother

11:53.321 --> 11:54.931
preaching on Christmas Eve,
I should turn

11:54.975 --> 11:56.411
the whole thing over to y'all.

11:56.454 --> 11:57.891
Oh, well, if you insist.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.764
Thank you so much, everybody.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.461
-Sweetheart, it's Tracie.
-That was great.

12:03.505 --> 12:04.985
Oh.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.683
All right, thank you all.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.641
-Everybody, shush!
-Hi, sweetheart.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.557
It's Tracie.
The one we've been prayin' for.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.255
Hey, mom, how are you?

12:14.298 --> 12:16.910
Well, honestly,
you're calling me,

12:16.953 --> 12:18.520
so I'm a little panicked.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.478
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.959
Yeah, everything's fine.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.919
So the girls and I

12:25.962 --> 12:29.531
were talking about maybe...

12:30.793 --> 12:32.839
comin' down for Christmas.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.016
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

12:36.059 --> 12:38.105
We would be so thrilled!

12:38.148 --> 12:41.543
We haven't had you here
for three years.

12:41.586 --> 12:44.633
But we would be

12:44.676 --> 12:46.722
bringing Rick with us.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.332
Oh.

12:48.376 --> 12:50.987
Why on Earth
would Rick be comin'?

12:51.031 --> 12:52.554
That's the ex-husband.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.817
-Oh!
-The country singer.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.341
It was kind of a wish
that the girls had.

12:57.385 --> 12:59.561
It's hard on them to split
the day, and, you know,

12:59.604 --> 13:02.520
of course, they wanna see you.

13:02.564 --> 13:05.306
So I-I told him
I-I had to think about it.

13:05.349 --> 13:09.223
And, well,
I want to get your opinion.

13:09.266 --> 13:12.052
Well, I...

13:12.095 --> 13:15.055
I think
it's a little inappropriate.

13:15.098 --> 13:18.841
I totally understand.
And they will, too.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.975
How would we explain it to
the rest of the family, honey?

13:22.018 --> 13:24.020
It's just too awkward.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.935
Well, the three of you
could come, though.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.807
We would just love that.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.460
Yeah, I mean,
if Rick isn't coming,

13:29.504 --> 13:31.506
then we'll need
to stay close to home

13:31.549 --> 13:35.031
so we can do the usual
Christmas-Day swap.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.251
I know it's-it's complicated,
but it's just...

13:37.294 --> 13:40.732
a part of
the every-other-holiday deal.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.691
Well, sweetheart, we haven't
seen you and the girls

13:42.734 --> 13:43.866
in a long time.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.476
Oh, hi, dad.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.175
Hi, honey, so everybody
being together,

13:48.218 --> 13:50.220
you and Rick and the girls,
that-that's the only thing

13:50.264 --> 13:52.832
they want for Christmas?

13:52.875 --> 13:54.964
How-how bad could it be?

13:56.270 --> 13:58.359
Guys, really, it's fine.

13:58.402 --> 14:01.057
I will come up with something

14:01.101 --> 14:03.364
to make them forget about it.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.975
Yeah, I'll let 'em know.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.977
All right, bye, guys.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.327
-Love you.
-Love you, baby.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.114
Well,
that came and went fast.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.378
"No room at the inn."

14:17.421 --> 14:20.381
I've heard that one before.

14:20.424 --> 14:22.818
Do you really want us
spending Christmas with Rick?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.777
Do you want to make Tracie
spend Christmas with Rick?

14:25.821 --> 14:29.259
I want to spend Christmas
with my family.

14:29.303 --> 14:32.045
I've got two good knees
and two little granddaughters

14:32.088 --> 14:34.047
that are still tiny enough
to sit on 'em,

14:34.090 --> 14:36.788
for a few more years, anyway.

14:36.832 --> 14:39.704
Look, Rick is their father.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.098
And I think
it's a small price to pay.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.579
Oh...

14:45.972 --> 14:48.191
Every time I think of that boy,

14:48.235 --> 14:52.108
I just think
of all the hardship he's caused.

14:53.544 --> 14:57.331
Well, do you want Tracie
to tell the girls

14:57.374 --> 15:00.943
that Mimi said no
to their Christmas wish?

15:00.987 --> 15:03.903
'Cause that's exactly
what she's fixin' to do.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.558
It's Mimi!

15:07.602 --> 15:08.864
She's going to say yes.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.431
Do the face thingy.
I wanna see her!

15:10.474 --> 15:12.737
-Girls! Careful.
-It's not a face call.

15:12.781 --> 15:15.479
-Hi, Mimi.
-Mom, you're on speaker.

15:15.523 --> 15:17.394
Did you hear about our wish?

15:17.438 --> 15:20.310
Oh, I sure did, baby cakes.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.922
Pop Pop and I talked it over,
and we would

15:22.965 --> 15:26.621
love to have you girls
here for Christmas.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.144
Daddy, too?

15:28.188 --> 15:30.538
Daddy... yes.

15:30.581 --> 15:33.280
Daddy, too,
if he really wants to.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.455
Yay!

15:34.498 --> 15:36.848
Christmas at Mimi and Pop Pop's!

15:36.892 --> 15:38.807
Christmas at Mimi and Pop Pop's!

15:38.850 --> 15:40.983
Christmas at Mimi and Pop Pop's!

15:41.027 --> 15:43.072
Christmas
at Mimi and Pop Pop's!

15:43.116 --> 15:45.422
Christmas
at Mimi and Pop Pop's!

16:00.263 --> 16:02.265
Of course, with the guitar.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.399
Daddy!

16:08.445 --> 16:10.578
Are you sure about this?

16:10.621 --> 16:13.798
No, but if your folks
can hack it, so can I.

16:13.842 --> 16:15.539
For the girls.

16:15.583 --> 16:18.194
Remind me again why we're
not taking your big truck?

16:18.238 --> 16:19.674
Uh, I'm letting Misty borrow it.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.023
She's gotta get rid
of some furniture.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.852
She is movin' to Florida.
Uh, keys.

16:25.680 --> 16:29.118
Well, if Misty's moving, does
that mean you're out of a job?

16:29.162 --> 16:32.208
No, Tracie, I pay my bills,
okay? Give me a break.

16:32.252 --> 16:36.169
I mean, seriously,
have I missed...

16:36.212 --> 16:39.520
In the last six months,
have I ever missed payin' you?

16:39.563 --> 16:43.219
-No. What's in that?
-It is a suit.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.656
To dress up with my girls
for Christmas Eve, right?

16:45.700 --> 16:48.137
-Ooh!
-Okay, whatever.

16:48.181 --> 16:50.618
Put it in the...

16:50.661 --> 16:54.361
Please tell me there are gifts
in here somewhere for the girls.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.885
Um, n-no. I mean, not the...

16:56.928 --> 16:59.148
And this trip is the,
is the present, right?

16:59.192 --> 17:01.890
That's a-all they want
and all that, with the picture?

17:01.933 --> 17:05.894
Well, yeah, Rick. But seriously?
They're kids.

17:05.937 --> 17:07.591
You think they're gonna be fine
with nothing under the tree

17:07.635 --> 17:09.637
when all their cousins have,
like, a million presents?

17:09.680 --> 17:11.769
Okay, okay. I'll cover it,
I'll find something.

17:11.813 --> 17:13.641
-In Lawrenceburg?
-Yeah, in Lawrenceburg.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.251
-Okay.
-They have stores there.

17:15.295 --> 17:16.644
All right, calm down.
What is going on?

17:16.687 --> 17:18.080
I'm just trying to give them

17:18.124 --> 17:20.082
the Christmas that they want.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.344
Well, me, too.

17:23.564 --> 17:26.045
It's four days.
Let's just get this over with.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.655
Four days, right?

17:27.698 --> 17:29.570
I need a kiss on each cheek,
please.

17:29.613 --> 17:30.658
Buckle, buckle!
Hello, hello.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.007
Seatbelts, seatbelts.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.226
-All right.
-Daddy, seatbelt.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.618
And a one and a two

17:34.662 --> 17:36.664
and we're going to a farm, so...

17:36.707 --> 17:39.667
♪ Moo moo moo moo moo moo

17:39.710 --> 17:42.887
♪ Moo moo moo moo moo

17:42.931 --> 17:45.847

17:45.890 --> 17:48.980

18:07.477 --> 18:09.871
Okay, so let's not forget
about Mimi's china.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.351
There's no running
in the kitchen

18:11.394 --> 18:13.657
and no running
in the dining room.

18:13.701 --> 18:15.616
Everything is, like,
a hundred-years old there

18:15.659 --> 18:18.619
because everything belonged
to Mimi's mom.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.621
And-and try to keep everything
in your suitcase,

18:20.664 --> 18:23.189
so it's not just a total mess.
Okay?

18:24.886 --> 18:27.280
And in case
we need to make a quick exit.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.327
Are you hearin' me, hello?

18:31.371 --> 18:33.373
Are you talking to us, mom?

18:35.679 --> 18:37.725
I remember being there, mom.

18:37.768 --> 18:40.467
Any rules for me?

18:40.510 --> 18:43.209
Uh, lay low?

18:43.252 --> 18:47.430
Don't mention the bartending.

18:47.474 --> 18:51.173
How long's it been
since you've been home?

18:51.217 --> 18:53.262
Just been once
since the divorce.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.830
It's all I could handle.

18:55.873 --> 18:58.180
When was the last time
you went home?

18:58.224 --> 19:00.182
Nothing there to go back to.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.844
Okay, are you guys
ready for this, are you ready

19:09.887 --> 19:11.976
for all the cousins and the
aunts and uncles and everyone?

19:12.020 --> 19:13.282
Yay!

19:29.603 --> 19:30.995
What'd I miss, guys?
What'd I miss?

19:31.039 --> 19:32.736
Two scores. Sixty seconds.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.870
-What?
-Great time to get popcorn.

19:35.913 --> 19:39.308
-Dot that I, baby.
-I got it, mom.

19:39.352 --> 19:42.050
Doesn't that top layer
look a little crooked to you?

19:42.093 --> 19:43.965
-It's fine.
-There it is!

19:44.008 --> 19:45.227
-Great move!
-Whoo!

19:45.271 --> 19:47.316
Great move!
Come on, once more...

19:47.360 --> 19:48.709
Will Tracie be here for dinner?

19:48.752 --> 19:50.319
Well, they left
over two hours ago.

19:50.363 --> 19:53.409
-So it should be any minute now.
-Hm.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.324
You think
Rick will really show up?

19:55.368 --> 19:58.980
That's what they tell me.
I'll believe it when I see it.

19:59.023 --> 20:00.416
He was never around
when they were married.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.852
Why would he bother
to show up now?

20:03.289 --> 20:04.594
Surprise.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.380
-Aah! You made it.
-Hi.

20:07.423 --> 20:10.861
-Hi, we're here.
-I'm so glad.

20:10.905 --> 20:14.169
Give mommy a hug.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.606
-Oh. My best Christmas present.
-Aw...

20:16.650 --> 20:18.695
-Mimi!
-Oh!

20:18.739 --> 20:20.958
There's my girls!

20:21.002 --> 20:23.396
Big hugs. Big... Ooh!

20:23.439 --> 20:26.312
Hi! Oh, my gosh, it is so good
to see you guys.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.052
Come on, come on, come on,
let's go!

20:28.096 --> 20:30.272
-And they're...
-Not without a hug from Pop Pop.

20:30.316 --> 20:34.363
-This is chaos.
-Oh! Mwah! Mwah!

20:34.407 --> 20:35.625
-I love you.
-Hi, dad.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.584
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Merry Christmas.

20:37.627 --> 20:38.889
Merry Christmas.

20:41.109 --> 20:43.590
Don't forget
to take your coats off.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.418
Rick!

20:45.461 --> 20:48.072
-Hey, everybody.
-Ah, hey, you made it.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.249
Well, yeah, of course I did.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.600
-How are you?
-I'm, I'm good.

20:53.643 --> 20:55.993
-M-Merry Christmas.
-M-Merry Christmas, Beth.

20:56.037 --> 20:58.735
Lydia, h-how are you?
Maddie.

20:58.779 --> 21:01.608
Maddie, look at you.

21:01.651 --> 21:04.306
-Hi, Rick.
-Oh, hey, Ed.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.178
-Merry Christmas. Of course.
-Thanks for the invitation.

21:07.222 --> 21:10.225
Well, thank your daughters.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.619
Let's get all that stuff
up off the floor

21:12.662 --> 21:16.275
'cause it's almost time
for anniversary dinner.

21:16.318 --> 21:19.103
-Show 'em where to go, honey.
-Oh, yes, of course.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.805
Oh! Brought your guitar.

21:24.848 --> 21:28.852
-Okay. Up here.
-Okay, hang on.

21:28.896 --> 21:32.247
Steve and Rebecca
have the pullout in the study.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.163
And all the girls are up here
in your room.

21:35.206 --> 21:38.558
And since your girls
are our special guests,

21:38.601 --> 21:40.037
they have the bed

21:40.081 --> 21:42.953
and Maddie and Rosie
will take the blow-up.

21:42.997 --> 21:45.260
And we were able to get

21:45.304 --> 21:47.175
the single mattress
here on the landing,

21:47.218 --> 21:50.047
so this will be for you, Tracie.

21:50.091 --> 21:51.440
I can't take the basement?

21:51.484 --> 21:53.703
Uh, Connor and Jordan
are down there.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.618
Uh, these will be for you.

21:55.662 --> 21:57.446
You're welcome to the couch
in the den.

21:57.490 --> 22:00.623
It's a little short for you,
but it's the only spot left.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.364
-I'll take it.
-No, no, no, it's...

22:02.408 --> 22:04.279
That's... It's fine.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.412
All right, well,
you can, uh, put your things

22:06.455 --> 22:08.370
in the hall closet
down there and...

22:08.414 --> 22:11.068
If you have to smoke,
please do it outside.

22:11.112 --> 22:14.028
Mom, he hasn't smoked
since Harper was born.

22:14.071 --> 22:16.117
You know that.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.511
Oh. Good.

22:18.554 --> 22:20.904
All right, well,
let y'all get settled in.

22:20.948 --> 22:25.256
I'm sure you'd like to get
freshened up for dinner.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.737
I'm so happy you're all here.

22:31.175 --> 22:33.264
And we've been here
five minutes.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.397
Ten.

22:35.441 --> 22:38.531
But the girls are happy, so...

22:39.575 --> 22:41.882
Find my closet.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.536
And lay low.

22:44.537 --> 22:46.539
Maybe under a rug.

22:50.586 --> 22:52.849
Okay, everybody,
buffet is ready.

22:52.893 --> 22:54.503
Load up those plates.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.723
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

22:56.766 --> 22:58.115
-Thank you, Mimi.
-You're welcome.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.682
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

22:59.726 --> 23:03.077
Kids are in here and adults
are in the dining room.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.774
-Hm...
-Hey, Maddie.

23:07.516 --> 23:10.780
No, we gotta get
something to eat. Come on. Yes.

23:14.871 --> 23:18.179
I don't want one bite
left on your plate.

23:18.222 --> 23:20.007
You got it. You got it.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.844
Oh. Thank you, sir.

23:34.978 --> 23:38.242
Thank you.
It's fairly new, I've just...

23:44.684 --> 23:48.514
Looks like we, uh,
we might be missin' a spot.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.956
Oh, my stars.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.611
I am so sorry.

23:58.654 --> 24:02.136
Ed, would you mind getting
a folding chair from the hall?

24:03.920 --> 24:06.357
Uh, Ed,
I'll-I'll-I'll grab it, thanks.

24:06.401 --> 24:09.448
I've packed that closet
kinda full.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.451
Okay.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.975
Really, mom?

24:15.018 --> 24:16.890
Oh, Tracie, honestly.

24:16.933 --> 24:19.545
He was the last one
into the room.

24:19.588 --> 24:22.243
It could have been anybody
without a chair.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.245
Shall we say grace?

24:24.288 --> 24:26.465
Y'all scoot on down,
let Rick in here.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.814
Thank you.

24:36.257 --> 24:39.129
Lord, we thank you for this time

24:39.173 --> 24:41.610
to be together as a family.

24:41.654 --> 24:46.006
We thank you for the food
so lovingly prepared

24:46.049 --> 24:50.401
and we thank you for the
marriage of Rebecca and Steve.

24:50.445 --> 24:53.492
And, of course, we ask you
to bless all of the marriages

24:53.535 --> 24:56.103
here at this table,

24:56.146 --> 25:00.020
um, and those that are not

25:00.063 --> 25:02.805
and all the kids,
and, uh, all of us

25:02.849 --> 25:05.547
and everybody. Amen.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.506
Amen.

25:07.549 --> 25:10.726
So six years.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.206
Six amazing years.

25:12.249 --> 25:15.992
Two-thousand one-hundred
and ninety days.

25:16.036 --> 25:17.559
Aww...
Whoa.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.039
That's a long time for mom
to leave you alone

25:19.082 --> 25:20.127
about having kids.

25:20.170 --> 25:21.563
Well, who said I did?

25:21.607 --> 25:22.912
And it's about time I had

25:22.956 --> 25:24.392
more grandbabies to hold.

25:26.786 --> 25:28.483
-We're pregnant.
-We're pregnant.

25:30.833 --> 25:33.575
-Oh, my God! Oh!
-Yay!

25:33.619 --> 25:35.882
-Oh, congratulations.
-Thank you, mom.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.623
Oh!

25:37.666 --> 25:40.060
It has been so hard to wait
until now to tell you guys.

25:40.103 --> 25:42.584
Well, if we'd known,
we could have had two cakes.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.804
Oh! Yes!

25:47.154 --> 25:50.070
So we have double
what we had

25:50.113 --> 25:53.116
in first quarter last year,
and we'll be able to bring on

25:53.160 --> 25:54.509
two new partners
within the year.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.859
Good for you.

25:56.903 --> 26:00.907
Oh! Hey! No runnin'
in the dining room.

26:00.950 --> 26:03.997
Well, that's great, sweetheart.
That's-that's good news.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.652
It sounds like
everybody's doing really well.

26:06.695 --> 26:09.655
What about you, Tracie?
You haven't said much.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.395
How's work for you?

26:11.439 --> 26:14.660
I think
she's still at the diner.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.749
Yeah, I'm still there.

26:16.792 --> 26:18.751
Do you feel like
it's a good opportunity?

26:18.794 --> 26:21.492
Do they have benefits,
room for you to move up?

26:21.536 --> 26:23.799
Honey, it's a diner.

26:23.843 --> 26:26.846
I'm sure they train managers
and all that, shift leaders.

26:26.889 --> 26:29.500
She's not trying to build
a career off of waitressing.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.328
It just pays her bills.

26:31.372 --> 26:35.289
-What would you wanna do?
-Uh...

26:35.332 --> 26:37.596
I mean,
I, I started beauty school.

26:37.639 --> 26:41.208
You could always go back to it
or do night school or something.

26:41.251 --> 26:44.777
Yeah, I'm a single mom,
two kids.

26:44.820 --> 26:47.257
Paying for one-bedroom apartment
on tips.

26:47.301 --> 26:49.564
I don't know how I would

26:49.608 --> 26:52.698
afford that time or money.

26:52.741 --> 26:56.702
Rick helps out financially
with the girls, right?

26:56.745 --> 26:59.226
Assuming he has a job
other than his music.

26:59.269 --> 27:02.969
I know that I'm sittin'
pretty low here,

27:03.012 --> 27:05.580
but I am actually
still at the table,

27:05.624 --> 27:08.757
so, uh, I'll-I'll take that,
yes, um...

27:08.801 --> 27:12.456
-I do have another job.
-Really?

27:12.500 --> 27:14.589
What is it?

27:14.633 --> 27:18.854
Um, I am a bartender.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.862
You sell alcohol
to drunk people?

27:26.906 --> 27:28.908
-Honey, please--
-No, I don't.

27:28.951 --> 27:30.910
Technically, if they're drunk,
I take their keys

27:30.953 --> 27:32.868
and I get 'em safely home
in a cab.

27:32.912 --> 27:36.959
Well, I would never set foot
in a place like that.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.526
It's one thing to play there

27:38.569 --> 27:40.528
if you don't have
anywhere else to go.

27:40.571 --> 27:44.837
But to actually sell the alcohol
to the people?

27:44.880 --> 27:48.710
Now, as I re-recall,
I-I think that the good Lord

27:48.754 --> 27:51.408
turned some water into wine

27:51.452 --> 27:54.063
so that the party could last
a few more days.

27:54.107 --> 27:58.241
And as I recall, he said,
"Do not be drunk on wine

27:58.285 --> 28:00.374
which leads to debauchery.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.768
Instead, be filled
with the Spirit--"

28:02.811 --> 28:04.987
"And speak to one another
in psalms, hymns

28:05.031 --> 28:06.336
and spiritual songs.

28:06.380 --> 28:10.601
Sing and make music
in your hearts."

28:10.645 --> 28:12.081
You didn't much care
for my singin'

28:12.125 --> 28:13.779
when I was doin' that, either.

28:15.476 --> 28:17.652
If some of you will help me
clear the plates,

28:17.696 --> 28:20.089
we'll get this mess cleaned up.

28:29.969 --> 28:32.145
What was that?

28:32.188 --> 28:34.321
That was not laying low.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.453
Were you trying
to make it awkward?

28:36.497 --> 28:37.759
Trying to make them hate you?

28:37.803 --> 28:40.631
Well, it's way too late
for that.

28:40.675 --> 28:43.025
Sure took the pressure off you,
though, didn't it?

28:43.069 --> 28:46.681
Oh, like some kind of rescue?
I'm... I can handle them.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.162
Here's the difference
between you and me.

28:49.205 --> 28:53.209
-I don't care what they think.
-I don't either. I don't.

28:53.253 --> 28:55.255
Why are you getting so worked up
about it?

28:55.298 --> 28:57.083
I'm no...

29:01.609 --> 29:02.697
God...

29:24.588 --> 29:27.243
Hey. What are you guys doin'?

29:29.202 --> 29:33.510
Oh? Mm-hmm. Let me see.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.425
Ava was going to take
some pictures,

29:35.469 --> 29:38.167
but I told her they were
Mimi's and we have to ask.

29:38.211 --> 29:39.647
Hm.

29:44.260 --> 29:45.958
We were looking
for a wedding picture.

29:46.001 --> 29:49.178
Oh, I know there's one in here.

29:49.222 --> 29:52.442
Oh! Here's one.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.793
That's not very fancy.
Where's your bridesmaids?

29:54.836 --> 29:56.142
Oh, we didn't have bridesmaids.

29:56.185 --> 29:59.580
We, we eloped.

29:59.623 --> 30:02.278
What is that again?

30:02.322 --> 30:03.802
Eloped means

30:03.845 --> 30:06.152
that we just sort of

30:06.195 --> 30:07.544
ran off and got married

30:07.588 --> 30:09.633
and didn't tell anyone about it.

30:12.288 --> 30:15.248
If you wanna know
how to really make Mimi angry,

30:15.291 --> 30:17.772
that's how you do it.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.427
Okay, let's put these back
where we found them.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.406
-Mom, let's go sledding!
-Oh.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.887
-Come, let's go.
-Oh! No, don't take my--

30:45.931 --> 30:49.064
Let's go, let's go sled.
Let's go sled, let's go sled.

30:49.108 --> 30:51.066
-Oh, how early is it?
-Let's go sledding!

30:51.110 --> 30:53.939
It is never too early
to get out of this house.

30:53.982 --> 30:56.593
You, me and the girls.
Let's go do a sledding.

30:56.637 --> 30:59.770
Daddy said we could go sledding
on a hill by his old house.

30:59.814 --> 31:02.034
-Daddy said that?
-Mm, I said that.

31:02.077 --> 31:04.601
-Go get your coats.
-Okay. Oh.

31:06.429 --> 31:10.259
We have to be here
Christmas Eve and day,

31:10.303 --> 31:12.174
but we've got two good days
before then

31:12.218 --> 31:14.742
where we can choose
for ourselves, right?

31:14.785 --> 31:16.526
Let's go give them
a really good day.

31:16.570 --> 31:20.139
I'm exhausted.
And my mom has--

31:20.182 --> 31:22.141
The sooner we go,

31:22.184 --> 31:25.666
the easier it'll be to slip out
before she's awake.

31:41.551 --> 31:43.814
Looks better than it used to.

31:45.860 --> 31:49.951
Yeah, dad sold it
to Ollie Babbitt before he died.

31:49.995 --> 31:52.084
He just couldn't bear to leave
the house to you, could he?

31:53.650 --> 31:56.175
He left me his old Mustang.

31:56.218 --> 31:57.828
Hop Warren's been storing it
in his barn.

31:57.872 --> 31:59.961
I just had no reason
to go get it.

32:00.005 --> 32:02.659
That old junker? Wait.

32:02.703 --> 32:04.835
Did you say
Mr. Babbitt lives here?

32:04.879 --> 32:06.533
Yeah.

32:06.576 --> 32:10.537
Mr. Babbitt
used to shoot guns at us.

32:10.580 --> 32:13.279
No, more just up in the air.

32:13.322 --> 32:15.672
He used to shoot at you
with a gun?

32:15.716 --> 32:17.283
We would go out
in his cornfield

32:17.326 --> 32:19.154
and, uh,
he didn't much like that.

32:19.198 --> 32:20.939
He was just trying to scare us.

32:20.982 --> 32:23.245
What were you doing
in his cornfield?

32:24.725 --> 32:26.509
We were picking corn.

32:28.120 --> 32:31.036
I like corn.
It's my favorite vegetable.

32:31.079 --> 32:32.559
I liked it, too.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.127
But where's the sled hill?

32:35.170 --> 32:36.650
Actually,
right through the cornfield.

32:48.314 --> 32:50.969
Here we go.
I will push you.

32:51.012 --> 32:52.057
-We'll race.
-All right. Yeah.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.841
Oh, good, let's race.

32:53.884 --> 32:56.626
Harper's got the sides
and Ava is crazy.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.367
So who knows
what's gonna happen?

32:58.411 --> 33:01.980
-Uh, are you ready? One...
-One...

33:02.023 --> 33:03.807
-Two...
-Two...

33:05.809 --> 33:08.899
Who's that
trespassin' on my land?

33:08.943 --> 33:10.814
It's okay, sir! I'm, I was...

33:10.858 --> 33:13.382
-I used to live here!
-Used to live here?

33:13.426 --> 33:15.297
I was just showin' my girls
where I used to sled

33:15.341 --> 33:16.733
when I was a kid!

33:16.777 --> 33:20.041
-Are you R.J. Pruette's boy?
-Yes, sir!

33:20.085 --> 33:23.175
I should have aimed right
at you. Get on out of here.

33:23.218 --> 33:24.741
All right! Okay, yes!

33:24.785 --> 33:26.613
Uh, Merry Christmas!
Come on, come on, come on!

33:26.656 --> 33:28.049
You don't need, you don't need
to shoot anymore!

33:28.093 --> 33:29.572
-We got it. That's okay.
-Sorry! Sorry!

33:29.616 --> 33:31.226
Go! Go! Go! Go!

33:31.270 --> 33:33.141
Let's, uh, run.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.014
-Come on, come on.
-Let's go.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.537
-Let's go.
-Everybody good?

33:39.017 --> 33:41.280
That was so cool.

33:41.323 --> 33:44.022
We were like outlaws.

33:44.065 --> 33:45.893
-You all right?
-Yeah, you all right?

33:45.936 --> 33:47.547
Uh, no.

33:47.590 --> 33:50.985
Wow. That guy must not like
your dad.

33:51.029 --> 33:54.380
Oh, nobody did, baby girl.
Nobody did.

33:54.423 --> 33:55.729
Why?

33:57.383 --> 33:59.341
He had a mean streak.
He, uh...

33:59.385 --> 34:01.778
He was good
at pushing people away.

34:01.822 --> 34:04.825
He just didn't really know
how to love anybody.

34:04.868 --> 34:06.957
And he didn't let anybody
love him.

34:08.220 --> 34:10.787
Not even you?

34:13.616 --> 34:16.097
-Not really.
-That's sad.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.708
Good thing
you didn't turn out like him.

34:33.549 --> 34:36.726
Maybe a little bite.
Just a little one.

34:36.770 --> 34:38.728
Oh, no, no, she just wants
five cups of hot--

34:38.772 --> 34:40.948
Well, if it isn't
Rick and Tracie.

34:40.991 --> 34:43.777
-Oh, my gosh.
-Haven't seen since graduation.

34:43.820 --> 34:45.996
But I heard y'all got married.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.520
These must be your girls.

34:47.563 --> 34:51.437
Ashley, this is Harper and Ava.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.003
-Where are y'all living now?
-Nashville.

34:53.047 --> 34:55.702
Oh, big city.
What do y'all do there?

34:55.745 --> 34:57.573
-Um, I'm doing--
-I'm in the music business.

34:57.617 --> 35:00.576
And Tracie is in hospitality.

35:00.620 --> 35:03.492
Well, of course,
you're in the music business.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.581
I remember your little band.

35:05.625 --> 35:09.585
You know, your daddy,
he was a heartthrob.

35:09.629 --> 35:13.198
-Well, it's great to see you.
-You, too.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.156
And you, too.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.899
Well, you all just make
the cutest little family.

35:18.942 --> 35:21.510
Oh! Y'all have
a Merry Christmas.

35:21.554 --> 35:24.905
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

35:24.948 --> 35:29.083
"Y'all just have
the cutest family."

35:29.127 --> 35:30.606
-Thank you.
-So...

35:30.650 --> 35:34.088
There, she's back.
All right then.

35:34.132 --> 35:37.526
Okay, well,
it is about three o'clock.

35:37.570 --> 35:38.919
What do we wanna do now?

35:38.962 --> 35:40.747
-Can we go see a movie?
-Hm.

35:40.790 --> 35:43.010
-Yeah.
-I want ice cream.

35:43.053 --> 35:45.534
-Even better.
-Let's do both.

35:45.578 --> 35:46.579
-Hm.

Oh, it's a sweet...

36:23.877 --> 36:27.272
We went sledding
and saw an angry man with a gun.

36:27.315 --> 36:30.405
And we had lunch
and we went to the movies.

36:30.449 --> 36:32.407
It was the best day ever.

36:32.451 --> 36:34.714
-Where is Rosie?
-Oh, she's upstairs.

36:34.757 --> 36:36.759
Why don't you all go up
and see her?

36:45.507 --> 36:48.380
I've been callin' you all day.

36:48.423 --> 36:51.774
We've missed a whole day
with the girls

36:51.818 --> 36:54.908
and we were supposed to go
horseback riding.

36:54.951 --> 36:56.562
Don't you have your phone?

No, they just kind of
rushed me out this morning.

37:00.827 --> 37:03.873
Well, everybody else is already
gettin' ready for bed.

37:03.917 --> 37:06.441
I suggest you do the same.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.922
We have a very busy day
tomorrow.

37:22.327 --> 37:24.981
I spend all day, every day

37:25.025 --> 37:27.288
being nothing but responsible.

37:27.332 --> 37:29.508
So it felt kind of good.

37:29.551 --> 37:31.553
That's what
I should've said to her.

37:33.033 --> 37:35.209
I mean, jobs and kids

37:35.253 --> 37:38.343
and all this time
and life later

37:38.386 --> 37:40.823
and it's like
we're still 19 to her.

37:41.694 --> 37:45.524
You are in my bed.

37:45.567 --> 37:49.310
As long as I am sitting here,
this is still a couch.

37:49.354 --> 37:51.356
At least it wasn't for you.

37:51.399 --> 37:53.445
No, this is for me.

37:53.488 --> 37:57.318
She can just add irresponsible
to her list.

37:57.362 --> 38:00.495
-There's no list.
-There is a list.

38:00.539 --> 38:03.542
She keeps it handy like, uh,

38:03.585 --> 38:06.109
on her nightstand,
tucked in her Bible.

38:06.153 --> 38:08.198
Stop it.

38:09.678 --> 38:13.769
Number one, should have
married you in a church

38:13.813 --> 38:15.380
and waited for your parents
to approve.

38:15.423 --> 38:17.338
Oh, she was never gonna approve.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.209
That's for sure.

38:19.253 --> 38:21.342
Uh, number two, um...

38:21.386 --> 38:23.388
Oh!

38:23.431 --> 38:25.651
Should've quit the band
way sooner.

38:27.087 --> 38:30.351
Well, aren't you feeling
nostalgic tonight...

38:32.962 --> 38:35.922
I told you Chris' wife
made him quit the band.

38:35.965 --> 38:39.534
-She also made him do AA.
-Mm.

38:39.578 --> 38:41.797
He asked me to do his homework
with him.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.975
Uh, moral inventory,

38:46.019 --> 38:48.413
list of shortcomings,
stuff like that.

38:48.456 --> 38:50.415
She's got me thinkin'.

38:50.458 --> 38:53.026
If you had quit the band
back then,

38:53.069 --> 38:56.464
you would have resented me.

38:56.508 --> 38:59.467
-All of us.
-Maybe, maybe not.

39:03.428 --> 39:05.430
But at least
I'd still have you.

39:09.564 --> 39:11.653
Do I hear voices?

39:11.697 --> 39:13.916
They're just talking.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.049
I'll probably do 'em some good.

39:17.790 --> 39:22.098
They talked all day. What
are they still talkin' about?

39:22.142 --> 39:26.102
Well, I've been talking to you
for 40 years

39:26.146 --> 39:28.496
and we still find things
to talk about.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.632
Mm-hmm.

39:33.675 --> 39:35.938
So what, you would've started

39:35.982 --> 39:38.637
working at the bar a lot sooner?

39:40.595 --> 39:42.554
And you would've been happy?

39:42.597 --> 39:44.817
Bartending is not so bad.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.514
Or I, uh...

39:47.733 --> 39:49.299
could've gotten some other job.

39:49.343 --> 39:52.215
You know, something...

39:52.259 --> 39:53.782
something that keeps
normal hours

39:53.826 --> 39:55.915
so that you could
still go to school.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.228
I still could, you know?

40:09.624 --> 40:11.452
Where is this comin' from?

40:14.194 --> 40:15.456
I made...

40:16.588 --> 40:18.459
some mistakes.

40:18.503 --> 40:20.418
Yeah, you have.

40:22.158 --> 40:23.769
But there's no mistake
that I ever made

40:23.812 --> 40:25.814
because I didn't love you.

40:41.830 --> 40:44.354
You are not goin' down there.

40:44.398 --> 40:47.445
I'm just goin' down
to shoo her up here.

40:47.488 --> 40:49.229
It's late.

40:49.272 --> 40:50.926
-Honey.
-Oh-oh.

40:50.970 --> 40:53.015
We have a busy day tomorrow.

41:07.334 --> 41:09.945
So you like corn, huh?

41:09.989 --> 41:11.686
I love corn.

41:18.954 --> 41:22.349
-Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
-Mom! Mom!

41:22.392 --> 41:23.959
Straight to bed.

41:24.003 --> 41:27.354
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

41:27.397 --> 41:31.227
We are not following back
into this pattern.

41:31.271 --> 41:34.883
Whatever's happening here
is over.

41:34.927 --> 41:36.537
We have a big day tomorrow.

41:36.581 --> 41:39.322
Get to bed.
We all need some sleep.

41:39.366 --> 41:42.021
Well, I got a problem.

41:42.064 --> 41:44.458
I mean, I need Tracie
to get out of my bed

41:44.502 --> 41:47.156
so that I can actually
get some sleep.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.288
Tracie!

41:49.550 --> 41:51.639
-Tracie!
-Okay.

41:51.683 --> 41:54.207
Okay. Coming.

41:57.602 --> 41:58.646
Now.

42:05.044 --> 42:06.262
Goodnight, y'all.

42:18.753 --> 42:20.755
Want a couple more?

42:26.892 --> 42:28.676
Mom, how many is that?

42:28.720 --> 42:32.027
Oh, hush. He's a growing boy.

42:32.071 --> 42:35.204
Well, finally we're about ready
to call out the guard.

42:35.248 --> 42:39.252
Well, I was just sleeping in
a little on my vacation.

42:39.295 --> 42:40.819
Well, I've got good news.

42:40.862 --> 42:41.950
I was able to reschedule

42:41.994 --> 42:44.344
our horseback riding for today.

42:44.387 --> 42:47.521
Oh, it sounds fun.
Rick's really good with horses.

42:47.565 --> 42:50.132
Oh, no, I was just gonna
take us girls.

42:50.176 --> 42:51.873
"Us girls," meaning...

42:51.917 --> 42:54.180
You and me and Harper and Ava.

42:54.223 --> 42:55.660
Our neighbor invited us,

42:55.703 --> 42:58.750
but he's only got enough horses
for us.

42:58.793 --> 43:01.579
Oh. Well,
what's everybody else doing?

43:01.622 --> 43:03.624
Um, more Christmas shopping.

43:04.712 --> 43:06.409
Okay. So it's all planned?

43:06.453 --> 43:08.542
Well, if you'd been here
yesterday,

43:08.586 --> 43:11.719
you would have been
a part of the plannin'.

43:11.763 --> 43:15.331
You, uh, have something suitable
to wear for riding?

43:15.375 --> 43:17.638
Yeah, mom, it's like jeans.

43:17.682 --> 43:18.900
Of course I do.

43:22.077 --> 43:23.470
You want some more?

43:41.575 --> 43:44.012
Oh, what happened
to the Abbotts' old barn?

43:44.056 --> 43:48.190
Well, the new neighbor wanted
to make some improvements.

43:48.234 --> 43:50.889
He likes his horses, apparently.

43:50.932 --> 43:53.239
-There he is! Brent!
-Hey, Mimi.

43:53.282 --> 43:54.936
Darlin'.

43:54.980 --> 43:57.373
-Ooh!
-Hey.

43:57.417 --> 44:00.463
And these are my girls
I told you about.

44:00.507 --> 44:03.553
Harper and Ava,
and my daughter, Tracie.

44:03.597 --> 44:05.033
It's nice meeting you, Tracie.

44:05.077 --> 44:07.253
Let's introduce you girls
to some horses.

44:07.296 --> 44:08.384
-Be careful.
-Hand flat.

44:08.428 --> 44:09.647
-Mimi!
-Oh!

44:09.690 --> 44:10.865
-Hand flat.
-Ah.

44:10.909 --> 44:12.258
Oh!
Good one!

44:12.301 --> 44:13.999
That was a great job.

44:14.042 --> 44:15.304
Brent lived in Nashville.

44:15.348 --> 44:17.785
-Not too far from you.
-Oh, really?

44:17.829 --> 44:21.180
Yeah, I still work up there. I
telecommute a lot from here now.

44:21.223 --> 44:23.225
Just I was ready
to get some space.

44:23.269 --> 44:25.358
-Get back to nature.
-Hm.

44:25.401 --> 44:28.578
Girls, come look
at my favorite horse.

44:33.192 --> 44:35.237
♪ Heaven on Earth

44:35.281 --> 44:38.023
♪ I was hanging on the smile
of a little girl ♪

44:38.066 --> 44:41.896
♪ In her own little world
pretty red dress ♪

44:45.813 --> 44:48.163
♪ In her pretty red...

44:48.207 --> 44:50.035
Sounds good.

44:50.078 --> 44:52.907
I, uh, I didn't know
anybody else was still here.

44:52.951 --> 44:54.953
Yeah, I guess neither one of us
really wanna do,

44:54.996 --> 44:56.998
do any last-minute
Christmas shopping.

44:57.042 --> 45:00.219
Yeah. Nobody actually asked me.

45:00.262 --> 45:02.438
Oh. Well, did you need to shop?

45:03.309 --> 45:06.442
No, no, I, um...

45:06.486 --> 45:09.794
-I think I got it covered.
-You-you mind if I sit?

45:11.143 --> 45:12.231
Uh...

45:22.763 --> 45:25.331
So how's your work?

45:25.374 --> 45:28.595
Nobody asked you
the other night.

45:28.638 --> 45:31.772
Yeah, it's because they think
they know what I do

45:31.816 --> 45:34.732
and that it never changes.

45:34.775 --> 45:37.082
-Does it?
-Being a pastor?

45:37.125 --> 45:39.345
Oh, yeah.

45:39.388 --> 45:41.695
It gets harder all the time.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.958
And the truth is,

45:44.002 --> 45:46.352
nobody really wants religion
in their lives

45:46.395 --> 45:49.442
until they're so filled
with anxiety and stress

45:49.485 --> 45:50.486
that they show up

45:50.530 --> 45:52.662
and, or wanting somebody else

45:52.706 --> 45:54.577
to fix it for 'em.

45:54.621 --> 45:57.885
What I can offer 'em
is the hope I have

45:57.929 --> 45:59.974
and someone to listen.

46:01.193 --> 46:03.978
Sounds a little bit like my job.

46:04.022 --> 46:06.372
People get a lot of hope
from music.

46:06.415 --> 46:09.679
Oh, n-no, I was, I was talkin'
about bartending.

46:09.723 --> 46:11.899
Although I am sure
that people get

46:11.943 --> 46:14.249
a little more out of you
givin' 'em Jesus

46:14.293 --> 46:16.469
than me givin' 'em Jack Daniels.

46:17.905 --> 46:19.472
Careful now.

46:19.515 --> 46:21.866
Don't you let Martha hear you
laughing to that.

46:21.909 --> 46:23.650
I'm in the dog-house
enough already

46:23.693 --> 46:26.958
'cause of last night.

46:27.001 --> 46:28.698
Yeah.

46:28.742 --> 46:32.137
I heard you were kissin'
my daughter last night.

46:34.095 --> 46:37.011
Also heard
you were lookin' for a job.

46:37.055 --> 46:40.058
About time at my age.

46:40.101 --> 46:43.017
Guess it's time to be making
a little more money.

46:43.061 --> 46:46.368
If I made some more money, I
could finally pay you back for--

46:46.412 --> 46:49.894
Rick, that wasn't a loan.

46:49.937 --> 46:52.635
I didn't ask
any of my other daughters

46:52.679 --> 46:54.246
to pay me back
for their weddings.

46:54.289 --> 46:56.944
I know you and Tracie didn't
use the money for that,

46:56.988 --> 47:00.078
but... it was still yours.

47:03.211 --> 47:07.302
Although I'm not too sure
Martha would accept it, anyway.

47:07.346 --> 47:09.348
Coming from where I work.

47:09.391 --> 47:11.350
You mean the bar.

47:11.393 --> 47:15.833
Son, God puts us all in
different places for a reason.

47:15.876 --> 47:19.184
We're not all pastors.
What would be the point of that?

47:19.227 --> 47:23.928
So maybe if you're standing
there at your bar,

47:23.971 --> 47:28.715
at the last mile
of somebody's road,

47:28.758 --> 47:33.502
and you're listenin' to 'em
as seriously as you say you do,

47:33.546 --> 47:36.723
then you can turn 'em around
in the right direction.

47:36.766 --> 47:40.596
'Cause they're not coming to me,
they're coming to you.

47:40.640 --> 47:43.121
And you can give them hope
right where they're at.

47:45.950 --> 47:48.909
I am surprised
to hear you say that.

47:48.953 --> 47:50.345
Unfortunately, you and I

47:50.389 --> 47:54.001
didn't get to know each other
very well.

47:54.045 --> 47:57.178
I just wasn't too high on dads
most of my life.

47:57.222 --> 48:00.965
Well, I wasn't too high on
country western singers, either.

48:02.096 --> 48:04.577
But I'm willing to be wrong.

48:04.620 --> 48:06.274
How about you?

48:07.319 --> 48:08.842
You know, Ed,

48:08.886 --> 48:12.759
I actually could use a ride
somewhere.

48:17.590 --> 48:18.808
Wow!

48:20.941 --> 48:23.117
So he left this to you

48:23.161 --> 48:25.380
and you never came and got it.

48:25.424 --> 48:29.167
The last I saw, it was missin'
some pretty important parts.

48:30.385 --> 48:32.431
I didn't know he'd finished it.

48:38.524 --> 48:40.526
I always hated this car.

48:42.615 --> 48:45.052
My dad worked on it
pretty much every day.

48:45.096 --> 48:47.098
Never let me
so much as touch it.

48:52.625 --> 48:55.280
Pretty sure he loved this car
more than he loved me.

49:03.766 --> 49:06.769
How much do you reckon
it's worth?

49:06.813 --> 49:09.947
Well, I got a friend
with three Fairlanes

49:09.990 --> 49:12.253
in my congregation
we could ask.

49:19.086 --> 49:23.003
I work for ASCAP in Product
Strategy and User Experience.

49:25.179 --> 49:27.834
That's sort of an IT job.

49:27.877 --> 49:29.967
Uh, we just work
with the songwriters.

49:30.010 --> 49:32.143
Oh, my husband's a songwriter.

49:32.186 --> 49:34.841
Oh, I-I, I didn't think
you're married.

49:34.884 --> 49:37.017
Oh. Ex... My ex-husband.

49:38.497 --> 49:42.022
-Should we see where they went?
-Oh, yeah, man.

49:42.066 --> 49:43.545
Okay.

49:49.899 --> 49:52.337
You guys found a friend?

49:52.380 --> 49:53.816
Yeah, that's Blackie.

49:53.860 --> 49:55.557
-Ah!
-Oh!

49:55.601 --> 49:58.299
Are you okay?

49:58.343 --> 49:59.997
-Well, let me help you.
-Thank you.

50:00.040 --> 50:01.563
Please.

50:01.607 --> 50:02.869
Ugh!

50:02.912 --> 50:05.480
That was graceful.

50:05.524 --> 50:07.787
Let's get you back inside
and find you a pair of pants.

50:07.830 --> 50:09.397
No, no, no, I'm fine.

50:09.441 --> 50:12.357
Oh, yes, I think she'd be
much more comfortable.

50:12.400 --> 50:13.575
Thank you.

50:26.327 --> 50:30.114
Mom, all I'm saying is I didn't
need to wear his clothes.

50:30.157 --> 50:31.767
I could've just washed up
at home

50:31.811 --> 50:34.118
or, like, worn my clothes dirty.

50:34.161 --> 50:35.815
It was freezing

50:35.858 --> 50:38.774
and we still had the ride to do
and this stop to make...

50:38.818 --> 50:40.428
No, why are we back
at the church?

50:40.472 --> 50:43.823
Because this is where
I hide all the gifts.

50:43.866 --> 50:46.434
This kids snoop around too much
at home.

50:46.478 --> 50:49.481
I thought
maybe you could help me wrap.

50:49.524 --> 50:53.180
Why? Is there a handsome and
single man also helping wrap?

50:53.224 --> 50:56.053
Oh! So you admit
you think Brent is handsome.

50:56.096 --> 50:58.446
-No!
-Ha-ha!

50:58.490 --> 51:01.797
It's embarrassingly obvious
what you were trying to do.

51:02.972 --> 51:04.322
What?

51:04.365 --> 51:07.629
Introduce you to a nice man
with a good job

51:07.673 --> 51:10.154
who happens to live
very close to your mother?

51:10.197 --> 51:13.418
Why on Earth would I do
something like that?

51:15.463 --> 51:18.466
A man who has chandeliers
in his barn

51:18.510 --> 51:20.555
and hundred-dollar sweatpants.

51:20.599 --> 51:22.166
He's more of a cowboy
than Rick is.

51:22.209 --> 51:24.124
Why do you have to go there?

51:24.168 --> 51:25.734
Why does it always
have to end up being

51:25.778 --> 51:27.780
about making Rick look bad?

51:29.173 --> 51:31.784
What I saw last night scared me.

51:31.827 --> 51:35.918
Maybe you guys had
a sweet little day as a family,

51:35.962 --> 51:37.616
and that's great for the girls.

51:37.659 --> 51:40.097
Those are the memories
you want 'em to have.

51:41.141 --> 51:43.709
But the memories I have...

51:43.752 --> 51:45.667
are of you sobbing on the phone

51:45.711 --> 51:48.235
about him being gone
on some gig again

51:48.279 --> 51:49.932
and what women were there--

51:49.976 --> 51:52.544
That was, um,
just me being paranoid.

51:52.587 --> 51:55.024
And how is the money
ever gonna pay for everything?

51:55.068 --> 51:56.809
And it didn't.

51:56.852 --> 51:58.767
You lost the house
you bought with our money.

51:58.811 --> 52:01.640
A lot of people lost houses
that year, mom.

52:01.683 --> 52:04.251
You only have a house
because you inherited it.

52:04.295 --> 52:06.775
And when the dust settled,

52:06.819 --> 52:10.518
he just picked up his guitar
and he was off again.

52:10.562 --> 52:12.390
Well, he was touring.

52:12.433 --> 52:14.957
He was runnin' away.

52:15.001 --> 52:17.525
Just like he did
when he was 17.

52:17.569 --> 52:20.267
He had all those problems
at home he didn't wanna face,

52:20.311 --> 52:22.095
so he just left.

52:22.139 --> 52:23.879
And that's exactly
what he did to you

52:23.923 --> 52:27.231
when it comes right down to it.

52:27.274 --> 52:30.147
And, Tracie,
what assurance has he given you

52:30.190 --> 52:33.062
that anything has changed?

52:50.558 --> 52:52.125
God, I've always been terrible
at this.

52:52.169 --> 52:54.388
Yeah. Just give it to me.

52:59.393 --> 53:00.829
There you go.

53:04.442 --> 53:07.096
We just love you so much,
Tracie.

53:07.140 --> 53:11.100
I don't want you just tryin'
to make things work with Rick

53:11.144 --> 53:13.842
'cause you think there's
nobody else out there for you.

53:13.886 --> 53:15.670
'Cause there is.

53:15.714 --> 53:17.846
Like your neighbor.

53:17.890 --> 53:19.761
Not my decision.

53:23.635 --> 53:24.940
Come here.

53:26.333 --> 53:27.682
Mm...

53:29.597 --> 53:32.296
You hug your mother, Pruette.

53:37.170 --> 53:39.955
We are here for you.

53:39.999 --> 53:44.090

be here for you.

maybe I'd run these over to you
tonight.

Oh, my gosh! That's so nice!

...is there really such a thing
as a truce in a snowball fight?

56:27.819 --> 56:30.952
Too bad. Um, I've really enjoyed
meeting you and the girls.

56:32.345 --> 56:34.434
All's fair in love and war, man.

56:37.132 --> 56:38.482
Thanks, Steve.

56:41.093 --> 56:43.225
-Whoa! Oh!
-Oh, it's on!

56:43.269 --> 56:44.531

What is goin' on?

56:50.189 --> 56:52.713
Brent, are you okay?
Yes, ma'am.

56:52.757 --> 56:55.063
I was just returning
Tracie's pants.

56:55.107 --> 56:56.761
Oh, well, I was about ready

56:56.804 --> 56:59.981
to call these fools in
to come get ready for supper.

57:00.025 --> 57:01.505
So y'all come in, too.

57:01.548 --> 57:03.245
I appreciate it.
I probably shouldn't have--

57:03.289 --> 57:05.900
No, there's plenty.
You get in here.

57:05.944 --> 57:08.120
All of you get in here
right now!

57:08.163 --> 57:09.426
Her pants.

57:12.254 --> 57:14.300
Oh. Thank you.

57:16.041 --> 57:18.260
That's a lot
of hand holding, huh.

57:19.523 --> 57:21.525
Thanks, Evan. All right.

57:22.526 --> 57:24.092
I saw that, too.

57:25.790 --> 57:28.923
-Mama, you did good.
-Thank you, darling.

57:28.967 --> 57:31.012
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just, I was just coming.

57:34.842 --> 57:36.365
Have a seat.

57:38.585 --> 57:40.674
All right,
let's have a blessing.

57:42.371 --> 57:44.504
Heavenly Father,
we stand before you

57:44.548 --> 57:47.115
in awe and gratitude

57:47.159 --> 57:49.378
for all the abundance
you've given us,

57:49.422 --> 57:52.686
specifically, the gift
of family. Family's everything.

57:52.730 --> 57:55.254
We're so grateful
for a new grandbaby on the way.

57:55.297 --> 57:57.909
We're grateful to have Brent
here as our guest this evening

57:57.952 --> 57:59.824
and, um, most of all,

57:59.867 --> 58:02.304
the fact that everybody here
tonight has a full-fledged,

58:02.348 --> 58:04.568
full-sized adult chair.

58:04.611 --> 58:06.874
-Amen.
-Amen.

58:06.918 --> 58:09.268
-Very funny.
-Thank you.

58:09.311 --> 58:12.967
Oh, those girls had so much fun
on those horses today.

58:13.011 --> 58:15.622
You should have seen
their faces.

58:15.666 --> 58:18.495
They were all beautiful riders.
They took right to the saddle.

58:18.538 --> 58:19.887
Not afraid like a lot of kids.

58:19.931 --> 58:21.454
You should be,
you should be proud.

58:21.498 --> 58:24.370
We are very proud of them.

58:24.413 --> 58:26.111
Mm.

58:26.154 --> 58:28.940
Excuse me.
Brent, this is Rick.

58:28.983 --> 58:30.376
Oh, you must be
the girls' father.

58:30.419 --> 58:32.987
-The, the songwriter?
-That's right.

58:33.031 --> 58:35.033
So you're actually here
for Christmas?

58:36.469 --> 58:38.471
Well, Tracie didn't explain
that part.

58:39.516 --> 58:40.952
Not on purpose.

58:40.995 --> 58:42.606
That's impressive.

58:42.649 --> 58:44.564
Some people
would find that awkward.

58:44.608 --> 58:47.654
You have no idea
how awkward it is.

58:47.698 --> 58:48.786
Hm.

58:51.310 --> 58:52.920
Hm.

58:52.964 --> 58:55.967
So, uh, Rick and I went out
and picked up

58:56.010 --> 58:59.927
his inheritance today,
a '68 Mustang Fastback.

58:59.971 --> 59:02.713
I'm surprised that thing
ran enough to even get here.

59:02.756 --> 59:05.542
No, it's not
how you remember it.

59:05.585 --> 59:06.717
Hm.

59:06.760 --> 59:09.546
So you're
a classic-car guy then.

59:09.589 --> 59:11.852
You gotta make big money
for that hobby.

59:11.896 --> 59:15.247
Classic cars and boats are just
holes you pour your money into.

59:16.857 --> 59:18.511
How much does it cost

59:18.555 --> 59:21.906
to feed four horses?

59:21.949 --> 59:24.169
Uh, let... You know what?
I mean...

59:24.212 --> 59:26.258
Same thing as havin'
a sweet car, havin' a horse.

59:26.301 --> 59:29.522
It's, uh, surely good
for helping you get chicks.

59:29.566 --> 59:31.393
Ain't that right, Brent?

59:34.788 --> 59:37.486
All right, I'm done.

59:40.098 --> 59:42.448
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

59:56.244 --> 59:58.333
-What was that about?
-Okay, what happened?

59:58.377 --> 1:00:00.814
Yesterday was really great.

1:00:00.858 --> 1:00:05.079
And then tonight
I'm on the outs.

1:00:05.123 --> 1:00:07.604
What? Is it this guy?

1:00:07.647 --> 1:00:08.866
Is it your mom?

1:00:10.258 --> 1:00:12.696
Maybe I just need some time
to think.

1:00:14.175 --> 1:00:16.047
Think about what?

1:00:17.178 --> 1:00:19.354
I don't know.

1:00:19.398 --> 1:00:21.618
Us.

1:00:21.661 --> 1:00:23.924
Maybe we just got caught up
in the moment.

1:00:23.968 --> 1:00:27.145
No. We didn't.

1:00:27.188 --> 1:00:29.234
Well, maybe I did.

1:00:31.410 --> 1:00:33.760
-Did your mom tell you that?
-No, my mom--

1:00:33.804 --> 1:00:36.502
Well, she spent the whole day
whispering in your ear,

1:00:36.545 --> 1:00:38.504
tryin' to fix you up
with the guy who doesn't have

1:00:38.547 --> 1:00:41.420
the list of things that Rick
has done bad in his life.

1:00:41.463 --> 1:00:42.508
There's no list.

1:00:42.551 --> 1:00:44.641
Did you defend me even one time?

1:00:45.729 --> 1:00:47.252
Ah, Trace...

1:00:49.254 --> 1:00:50.777
How do you expect her
to ever like me

1:00:50.821 --> 1:00:53.606
if she never knew me?

1:00:53.650 --> 1:00:55.869
-You're too afraid of her.
-I am not afraid of--

1:00:55.913 --> 1:00:58.089
You are
because you never correct her.

1:00:58.132 --> 1:00:59.612
You never tell her
who I actually am.

1:00:59.656 --> 1:01:01.005
And so she just goes on thinkin'

1:01:01.048 --> 1:01:02.615
she knows and that she's right.

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:04.661
I don't even know what's right.

1:01:05.662 --> 1:01:07.968
You know me.

1:01:08.012 --> 1:01:11.668
Trace, you know me
better than anybody.

1:01:11.711 --> 1:01:13.757
Well, maybe that's not enough.

1:01:16.934 --> 1:01:20.720
Maybe I just spent so much time

1:01:20.764 --> 1:01:22.896
loving you

1:01:22.940 --> 1:01:24.985
that I didn't wanna be wrong
about it.

1:01:26.857 --> 1:01:28.336
Excuse me.

1:01:29.860 --> 1:01:31.905
We can hear y'all in there.

1:01:39.130 --> 1:01:40.958
Hey.

1:01:41.001 --> 1:01:42.829
I told the kids
I'd put 'em to bed tonight

1:01:42.873 --> 1:01:45.266
so you could have more time
with the adults.

1:01:45.310 --> 1:01:47.051
Actually, mom, I was thinking,

1:01:47.094 --> 1:01:48.313
how about just
heading on to bed?

1:01:48.356 --> 1:01:50.097
I'm really tired.

1:01:52.056 --> 1:01:54.885
Okay! Who wants dessert?

1:01:57.061 --> 1:01:58.802
All right, all right.

1:01:58.845 --> 1:02:00.586
That's enough
of all this giggling.

1:02:00.629 --> 1:02:02.849
Everyone else is asleep.

1:02:02.893 --> 1:02:06.200
You know, I used to have
four little girls in this room

1:02:06.244 --> 1:02:10.422
up all hours
doing the same thing.

1:02:10.465 --> 1:02:14.905
And you know what we did
to whoever was giggling?

1:02:14.948 --> 1:02:17.255
Tickle fight! Tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle!

1:02:20.301 --> 1:02:22.434
Tuck, tuck, tuck.

1:02:22.477 --> 1:02:24.131
One bedtime song.

1:02:24.175 --> 1:02:27.221
♪ Away in a manger

1:02:27.265 --> 1:02:30.659
♪ No crib for a bed

1:02:30.703 --> 1:02:33.967
♪ The little Lord Jesus

1:02:34.011 --> 1:02:36.840
♪ Lay down His sweet head

1:02:36.883 --> 1:02:40.191
♪ The stars in the sky

1:02:40.234 --> 1:02:44.282
♪ Look down where He lay

1:02:44.325 --> 1:02:48.329
♪ The little Lord Jesus

1:02:48.373 --> 1:02:53.421
♪ Asleep on the hay

1:02:55.293 --> 1:02:57.338
Love you so much.

1:02:58.905 --> 1:03:03.431
Let's blow out the light.
One, two, three.

1:03:43.471 --> 1:03:45.909
♪ Oh my heaven on Earth

1:03:47.867 --> 1:03:51.218
♪ Now heaven on Earth

I'm not smokin'.

1:04:15.068 --> 1:04:16.591
Avoiding us?

1:04:18.158 --> 1:04:20.465
I'm just working on something.

1:04:20.508 --> 1:04:22.380
Your next hit song?

1:04:24.338 --> 1:04:27.298
You know, it's not good for
a guitar to be out in the cold.

1:04:27.341 --> 1:04:31.084
Well, it's not really
good for me to be in the house.

1:04:31.128 --> 1:04:35.959
Are we really that bad that you
can't survive us for four days?

1:04:36.002 --> 1:04:38.222
Four days without being rude
to our neighbors

1:04:38.265 --> 1:04:40.006
for the sake of your girls?

1:04:40.050 --> 1:04:42.574
Now, what about tryin' to set
Tracie up with the neighbor

1:04:42.617 --> 1:04:44.315
right in front of me,
that isn't rude?

1:04:44.358 --> 1:04:47.013
You had your shot. You blew it.

1:04:47.057 --> 1:04:50.930
So I don't really see
a problem with it, no.

1:04:52.323 --> 1:04:54.064
Tracie doesn't want to be
a single mother

1:04:54.107 --> 1:04:55.717
for the rest of her life.

1:04:55.761 --> 1:04:58.546
Frankly, I don't think
she can afford it.

1:04:58.590 --> 1:05:00.722
And those girls
deserve a real family,

1:05:00.766 --> 1:05:02.420
a father who is there.

1:05:02.463 --> 1:05:04.813
Okay. I am there.
And those are my girls.

1:05:04.857 --> 1:05:06.380
-And whenever they need me--
-Really?

1:05:06.424 --> 1:05:08.905
Where were you
when I was driving two hours

1:05:08.948 --> 1:05:10.471
every couple of days,

1:05:10.515 --> 1:05:13.431
changing diapers
and packing dishes

1:05:13.474 --> 1:05:15.346
and pickin' up her pieces?

1:05:15.389 --> 1:05:17.043
And making Tracie
feel like trash

1:05:17.087 --> 1:05:18.653
when she's the most special--

1:05:18.697 --> 1:05:21.569
How do you think she felt
when you just ran off

1:05:21.613 --> 1:05:24.398
and shirked
all your responsibilities?

1:05:24.442 --> 1:05:28.533
Tracie was a Jacobs
before she was a Pruette.

1:05:28.576 --> 1:05:30.361
We're her family.

1:05:30.404 --> 1:05:32.624
And we want what's best for her.

1:05:32.667 --> 1:05:35.366
No, you don't!
You want what's best for you!

1:05:35.409 --> 1:05:37.890
You couldn't even keep
your own family together.

1:05:37.934 --> 1:05:41.938
Don't you dare try to tell me
what's wrong with mine!

1:05:41.981 --> 1:05:46.377
I'm doing my absolute best
to fix my family.

1:05:46.420 --> 1:05:49.597
Well, it's not going to happen
under my roof.

1:05:49.641 --> 1:05:51.034
Tracie's a grown woman now

1:05:51.077 --> 1:05:53.775
and she can make
her own decisions.

1:05:53.819 --> 1:05:58.041
Exactly. Let her choose the life
she wants.

1:05:59.781 --> 1:06:00.957
All right.

1:06:02.088 --> 1:06:03.350
I will.

1:06:07.702 --> 1:06:09.704
I just hope you can do the same.

1:06:36.035 --> 1:06:37.384
What are you doin'?

1:06:38.995 --> 1:06:41.040
Uh, where's your mom,
sweetheart?

1:06:41.084 --> 1:06:42.694
She's upstairs taking a shower

1:06:42.737 --> 1:06:45.349
before all the hot water
runs out.

1:06:45.392 --> 1:06:47.699
Are you going somewhere?

1:06:47.742 --> 1:06:49.353
I, uh...

1:06:52.486 --> 1:06:53.748
Look, I...

1:06:55.707 --> 1:06:57.056
I had the best time hangin' out

1:06:57.100 --> 1:06:59.624
with you two good folks
and your mom.

1:06:59.667 --> 1:07:00.799
I just...

1:07:02.844 --> 1:07:06.065
I gotta get home. Okay?

1:07:06.109 --> 1:07:08.154
You're going to have

1:07:08.198 --> 1:07:11.418
the best time tonight.

1:07:11.462 --> 1:07:14.378
And then you're gonna have
an even better time tomorrow.

1:07:14.421 --> 1:07:17.294
With all the cousins
and all the gifts? Come on.

1:07:19.035 --> 1:07:21.428
But what about Christmas?

1:07:21.472 --> 1:07:23.996
Well, that's the cool part.

1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:26.259
You're gonna have
a Christmas here.

1:07:26.303 --> 1:07:29.088
And I know how many presents
you're getting.

1:07:29.132 --> 1:07:32.526
And then when you come home,

1:07:32.570 --> 1:07:35.051
we're gonna have
a whole second Christmas.

1:07:35.094 --> 1:07:36.443
Like always.

1:07:38.793 --> 1:07:42.145
We agreed we'd try this,
and it just didn't go so good.

1:07:43.276 --> 1:07:45.844
Mimi and I, we, um,

1:07:45.887 --> 1:07:47.933
we just, we just don't have
a whole lot in common.

1:07:47.976 --> 1:07:51.502
-That's it.
-You're both good at music.

1:07:53.243 --> 1:07:55.419
I wish that was enough.

1:07:56.985 --> 1:07:58.465
Okay, come here.

1:08:02.861 --> 1:08:04.471
Oh, I love you so much.

1:08:06.299 --> 1:08:08.432
Tell your mom I'll give her
a call in just a little bit.

1:08:08.475 --> 1:08:10.869
Mwah!

1:08:10.912 --> 1:08:14.699
And I will see you
when you get home, okay?

1:09:06.403 --> 1:09:08.622
Okay, everybody,
in front of the tree.

1:09:08.666 --> 1:09:09.797
We want to get this picture...

1:09:09.841 --> 1:09:12.060
Ed, get down here for the photo

1:09:12.104 --> 1:09:13.975
and bring the kids.

1:09:15.368 --> 1:09:19.067
What did you say to him?
Rick left.

1:09:19.111 --> 1:09:22.680
Well, that's not really
surprising to anybody, is it?

1:09:22.723 --> 1:09:26.074
For no reason?
Yeah, mom, actually, it is.

1:09:26.118 --> 1:09:30.166
What did you say to him
to run him off on Christmas Eve?

1:09:30.209 --> 1:09:31.602
Why don't you see it?

1:09:31.645 --> 1:09:33.125
He drove you from this family

1:09:33.169 --> 1:09:35.214
and we are fightin'
to get you back.

1:09:35.258 --> 1:09:39.175
He didn't drive me
from this family, mom. You did.

1:09:39.218 --> 1:09:41.264
Oh, so I'm supposed to stand by

1:09:41.307 --> 1:09:43.918
and let my children
make bad choices?

1:09:43.962 --> 1:09:45.268
Bad choices?

1:09:47.574 --> 1:09:49.576
What about these two?

1:09:49.620 --> 1:09:52.579
Amazing, smart,

1:09:52.623 --> 1:09:56.017
sweet, crazy girls.

1:09:59.282 --> 1:10:02.502
They are a result
of my bad choices.

1:10:02.546 --> 1:10:05.331
And I don't regret them
for a second.

1:10:05.375 --> 1:10:07.986
Not even every time I put on

1:10:08.029 --> 1:10:11.250
that stupid waitress apron.

1:10:12.686 --> 1:10:14.819
So, yeah, mom.

1:10:14.862 --> 1:10:18.388
I do think you're supposed
to let me make bad choices.

1:10:19.606 --> 1:10:22.043
My own choices.

1:10:22.087 --> 1:10:25.177
Let me wrap
a really ugly present

1:10:25.221 --> 1:10:27.832
or teach me how to do it,

1:10:27.875 --> 1:10:30.051
how to crease the corners
and make it all perfect.

1:10:30.095 --> 1:10:32.358
But don't do it for me.

1:10:32.402 --> 1:10:34.926
And if I really mess up,

1:10:34.969 --> 1:10:39.757
just hug me and tell me,
"Everything's gonna be okay,"

1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:41.889
or, "The time will heal this,"

1:10:41.933 --> 1:10:43.978
and that
we all mess up sometime.

1:10:44.022 --> 1:10:46.372
Because, mom,
I mess up every day.

1:10:49.201 --> 1:10:50.855
And I want my girls to know

1:10:50.898 --> 1:10:55.251
that even when they fail,
I don't walk away.

1:10:56.426 --> 1:10:59.342
I'm gonna be there to hug them

1:10:59.385 --> 1:11:02.475
and to tell 'em
it's gonna be okay...

1:11:02.519 --> 1:11:06.784
even if they don't
go to college...

1:11:06.827 --> 1:11:10.135
even if they marry
a guy like Rick...

1:11:10.178 --> 1:11:14.487
or divorce him or fall in love
with him all over again...

1:11:14.531 --> 1:11:17.708
or realize they never stopped
loving him in the first place.

1:11:17.751 --> 1:11:20.928
Sweetheart, you were a teenager.

1:11:20.972 --> 1:11:22.060
Mom...

1:11:23.757 --> 1:11:26.891
this... is why

1:11:26.934 --> 1:11:28.980
we never come home
for Christmas.

1:11:32.375 --> 1:11:34.464
Good job. Okay, come on.

1:11:34.507 --> 1:11:36.944
Come on, baby.

1:11:36.988 --> 1:11:38.250
Let's go.

1:11:41.514 --> 1:11:45.692
Well, she always did have
a flair for drama.

1:11:47.999 --> 1:11:50.306
Mom?

1:11:50.349 --> 1:11:53.221
What? You have something
to add to this?

1:11:53.265 --> 1:11:54.701
I didn't make tenure.

1:11:54.745 --> 1:11:56.660
After all those years
at the same school,

1:11:56.703 --> 1:11:58.139
I'm gonna have to start
all over.

1:11:58.183 --> 1:11:59.532
Probably take a pay cut

1:11:59.576 --> 1:12:02.056
so I can start tenure track
somewhere else.

1:12:02.100 --> 1:12:03.101
What?

1:12:03.144 --> 1:12:05.016
I could've covered us

1:12:05.059 --> 1:12:06.757
with a raise when I got my PhD,

1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:09.368
but now the school is saying
they don't have the budget.

1:12:09.412 --> 1:12:12.502
I didn't wanna tell you 'cause
I knew you'd be disappointed.

1:12:12.545 --> 1:12:15.722
Garrett and I are in marriage
counseling.

1:12:15.766 --> 1:12:17.855
It's mostly for us,
but we're also talkin' to her

1:12:17.898 --> 1:12:20.118
about Maddie's eating disorder.

1:12:21.032 --> 1:12:23.556
Maddie has a...

1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:26.080
Why didn't you tell me
any of this?

1:12:27.125 --> 1:12:28.605
Honestly, mom,

1:12:28.648 --> 1:12:30.041
because you would have
freaked out

1:12:30.084 --> 1:12:31.912
or just tried to fix it.

1:12:31.956 --> 1:12:34.001
And I don't know which is worse.

1:12:39.137 --> 1:12:41.139
What else don't I know?

1:12:42.575 --> 1:12:44.490
Nothing from us.

1:12:44.534 --> 1:12:47.232
Oh. Well, at least
someone's perfect.

1:12:47.275 --> 1:12:48.581
Lydia.

1:12:50.278 --> 1:12:52.890
I actually kind of like Rick.

1:12:52.933 --> 1:12:56.415
He's redeemed himself
a little bit, so...

1:12:56.459 --> 1:12:57.547
Yeah.

1:13:00.767 --> 1:13:04.162
Oh, I'm sorry, everyone,
for holding up the photo.

1:13:04.205 --> 1:13:06.904
Honey, can you,
can you help me figure out

1:13:06.947 --> 1:13:08.949
what is happening here?
This tie...

1:13:08.993 --> 1:13:12.170
I can't get the snowflakes
to line up.

1:13:12.213 --> 1:13:14.128
All right, sweetheart.

1:13:15.521 --> 1:13:19.046
Okay, what did I miss?

1:13:19.090 --> 1:13:21.266
We'll talk about it later.

1:13:21.309 --> 1:13:24.748
Can't have the pastor late
for Christmas Eve service.

1:13:24.791 --> 1:13:27.403
I think Tracie and the girls
already went ahead.

1:13:28.708 --> 1:13:30.362
-They did?
-Yeah.

'Cause I'm wearing
my goofy snowflake tie.

1:16:15.919 --> 1:16:19.313
You know, I was planning
to do this sermon

1:16:19.357 --> 1:16:22.665
that I have spent
the past several days preparing.

1:16:24.057 --> 1:16:26.930
And I would ask your forgiveness

1:16:26.973 --> 1:16:30.150
if this is not
a traditional Christmas sermon

1:16:30.194 --> 1:16:32.631
that you were expecting to hear.

1:16:35.765 --> 1:16:39.377
You know, it's become
increasingly clear to me...

1:16:40.552 --> 1:16:44.295
that we live in a broken world.

1:16:44.338 --> 1:16:47.864
And it's pretty hard
not to notice that.

1:16:47.907 --> 1:16:51.650
But I have to believe
that once upon a time

1:16:51.694 --> 1:16:53.957
this world was perfect.

1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:57.090
And then we came along.

1:16:57.134 --> 1:17:01.138
We got lost
in our selfish desires.

1:17:01.181 --> 1:17:03.923
But God didn't want it that way.

1:17:03.967 --> 1:17:06.883
He wanted to heal our hearts

1:17:06.926 --> 1:17:09.407
and mend our brokenness.

1:17:09.450 --> 1:17:13.672
So what was the first step
towards reconciliation?

1:17:13.716 --> 1:17:16.762
A child. Jesus.

1:17:16.806 --> 1:17:18.198
And if you think about it,

1:17:18.242 --> 1:17:22.202
Jesus was the very first

1:17:22.246 --> 1:17:24.161
Christmas gift.

1:17:24.204 --> 1:17:28.034
The perfect incarnation of love.

1:17:30.471 --> 1:17:34.301
I was speaking with a gentleman
earlier this week.

1:17:36.129 --> 1:17:38.088
A musician.

1:17:38.131 --> 1:17:40.307
And he was divorced.

1:17:40.351 --> 1:17:43.702
And because the music business
is so difficult,

1:17:43.746 --> 1:17:46.052
he was having to do
some bartending on the side

1:17:46.096 --> 1:17:47.967
to make ends meet.

1:17:48.011 --> 1:17:49.534
And during the chaos

1:17:49.577 --> 1:17:52.885
and travel of the holidays

1:17:52.929 --> 1:17:56.933
in heading back
to be with his family,

1:17:56.976 --> 1:18:00.763
he somehow forgot
to bring Christmas gifts

1:18:00.806 --> 1:18:03.113
for his two little girls.

1:18:03.156 --> 1:18:07.117
But rather than headin' off
to the nearby Toys"R"Us...

1:18:08.292 --> 1:18:10.511
instead, he wrote 'em a song.

1:18:10.555 --> 1:18:14.428
A song about the enormity
of his love for them.

1:18:15.473 --> 1:18:17.910
And I ask him, I said,

1:18:17.954 --> 1:18:19.825
"Do you think
the girls are old enough

1:18:19.869 --> 1:18:23.655
to fully appreciate
the value of a song

1:18:23.699 --> 1:18:25.483
over Barbies?"

1:18:25.526 --> 1:18:29.922
And he said,
"I'm not sure that they will.

1:18:29.966 --> 1:18:32.751
But maybe some year
down the road a bit,

1:18:32.795 --> 1:18:36.189
they will stop
and remember their dad

1:18:36.233 --> 1:18:38.844
and that special year

1:18:38.888 --> 1:18:42.979
when he gave them
a piece of himself...

1:18:44.589 --> 1:18:47.984
by expressing his feelings
in words

1:18:48.027 --> 1:18:51.857
that they could read and sing

1:18:51.901 --> 1:18:54.033
again and again."

1:18:54.077 --> 1:18:56.644
Because you see, my friends,

1:18:56.688 --> 1:18:59.909
he didn't hear those kind words
growin' up

1:18:59.952 --> 1:19:03.260
and he wanted to make sure
that they did.

1:19:04.870 --> 1:19:06.916
That's a Christmas gift.

1:19:09.657 --> 1:19:12.008
So the question is,

1:19:12.051 --> 1:19:15.272
do we love like that?

1:19:23.846 --> 1:19:27.458
Is that enough to get started?

1:19:27.501 --> 1:19:30.287
No idea how you came up
with this that fast.

1:19:30.330 --> 1:19:31.810
But I don't wanna know.

1:19:31.854 --> 1:19:34.378
It's the best gift
I could have ever ask for.

1:19:34.421 --> 1:19:36.380
It was legal, I promise.

1:19:36.423 --> 1:19:39.687
Welcome
to small-business ownership.

1:19:39.731 --> 1:19:40.950
Thanks.

1:19:58.663 --> 1:19:59.882
Hey.

1:20:01.579 --> 1:20:02.841
Hey.

1:20:05.757 --> 1:20:07.759
I did it.

1:20:10.980 --> 1:20:13.809
I told my mom
how I've been feeling.

1:20:13.852 --> 1:20:15.811
I stood up to her.

1:20:18.726 --> 1:20:20.032
You ran away from problems

1:20:20.076 --> 1:20:22.687
that you didn't know
how to deal with,

1:20:22.730 --> 1:20:24.732
yeah.

1:20:24.776 --> 1:20:26.822
But I just let you go.

1:20:29.999 --> 1:20:32.305
I'm not gonna let you run
this time, okay?

1:20:36.701 --> 1:20:38.659
I love you, Rick.

1:20:40.052 --> 1:20:42.228
Yeah, I'm not runnin' anymore.

1:20:47.843 --> 1:20:49.583
I love you, too.

1:20:53.370 --> 1:20:56.895
I'd like to introduce
the new owner of Jackie's Place.

1:20:56.939 --> 1:20:59.028
Give it up for Rick Pruette!

1:20:59.071 --> 1:21:01.900
Rick, get on up here! Come on!

1:21:01.944 --> 1:21:05.469
-What?
-I sold a car and bought a bar.

1:21:07.123 --> 1:21:09.821
And you are just in time.

1:21:09.865 --> 1:21:11.692

1:21:19.396 --> 1:21:20.919
Most of us are here tonight

1:21:20.963 --> 1:21:23.530
'cause, uh, we don't have
any family expecting us.

1:21:23.574 --> 1:21:26.577
I got two little girls who are
not here with me tonight.

1:21:26.620 --> 1:21:28.057
So I've put together
a little something for 'em.

1:21:28.100 --> 1:21:30.320
