without staining their
white suit to win the round.

07:38.867 --> 07:40.183
All right, Bob, here we go!

07:40.185 --> 07:42.202
We'll never speak
to you again if you lose.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.778
Have fun!

07:43.797 --> 07:45.522
-Wow, this coffee is hot.
-Yup.

07:45.540 --> 07:47.448
If you spill, it's gonna burn
your penis, Bob.

07:47.542 --> 07:48.467
Get in, get in, get in.

07:48.618 --> 07:50.635
-I want to win for her love.
-Okay.

07:50.787 --> 07:53.221
(engine revving)

07:55.217 --> 07:56.808
Hey. You know, I'm actually
pretty good at this.

07:57.035 --> 07:58.643
I guess all those years
in the restaurant

07:58.795 --> 08:00.036
serving coffee paid off.

08:00.055 --> 08:01.387
Well, we're still
on the straightaway, Robert.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.873
We're about to get to the cones,
so look alive back there.

08:03.892 --> 08:06.726
<i> BOB:</i>
<i> Oh, oh, oh, oh, God.</i>

08:06.820 --> 08:08.302
<i> Hang in there, penis.</i>

08:09.305 --> 08:12.065
Hello. Thanks
for letting me come over.

08:12.217 --> 08:14.901
I swear I heard the couch
making a lip-licking sound.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.828
So, what happened
to helping the kids

08:16.980 --> 08:18.571
with their Saturday tests?

08:18.665 --> 08:19.647
Oh, yeah.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.057
B-Bob's out with them now

08:21.076 --> 08:22.909
doing, um, night tutoring

08:23.061 --> 08:25.562
at the, uh, night library.

08:25.580 --> 08:26.505
Hey, you want some wine?

08:26.656 --> 08:28.081
Well, maybe half a cup.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.416
-You know I'm trying
to cut out liquids.
-Right, right.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.069
I can't believe
you put all this out for me.

08:33.162 --> 08:35.180
Well, uh, you're going
through a lot

08:35.349 --> 08:37.015
with your couch and stuff.

08:37.166 --> 08:39.351
-Cheers.
-Ow. Why'd you hit my glass?

08:39.578 --> 08:41.911
Gonna sit over here
if you're gonna be weird.

08:42.005 --> 08:43.504
Do you mind
if I take my shoes off?

08:43.582 --> 08:45.840
I have a foot fungus
up to my ankles,

08:45.934 --> 08:47.341
and it's really itchy.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.843
I'm just gonna rub them
on your rug.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.103
-Oh, oh.
-Nope, nope.

08:50.255 --> 08:51.863
-Oh, that's good.
-Uh, here, eat a cracker.

08:52.090 --> 08:53.848
It's got herbs. It's got herbs.

08:54.017 --> 08:55.441
Ugh, this tastes weird.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.035
-That's the herbs.
-I don't like 'em.

08:57.186 --> 08:59.946
Okay. So, do you know
any good gossip?

09:00.098 --> 09:02.432
Well, I heard there's
a new Toyota Tacoma

09:02.525 --> 09:05.710
coming out with a ton
of manufacturer's rebates.

09:05.862 --> 09:06.920
-Wow.
-(doorbell rings)

09:07.105 --> 09:09.773
-Ah! Who's here?
-Huh, I don't know.

09:09.791 --> 09:10.882
Hi, Lin.

09:10.959 --> 09:12.217
Gretchen, what are you
doing here?

09:12.386 --> 09:14.110
You left this
at the salon today.

09:14.129 --> 09:16.446
I thought it was drugs,
but I don't feel anything,

09:16.464 --> 09:18.782
so I think it's just
regular food in a bag.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.133
Oh, my travel fudge.

09:20.302 --> 09:21.968
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
see if I can sneak

09:22.120 --> 09:24.137
into the back of that bar
I got banned from.

09:24.289 --> 09:25.622
I'm gonna get really drunk
and win them over.

09:25.624 --> 09:28.900
Actually, Gayle's here
and we're drinking some wine

09:29.069 --> 09:31.144
and she's being very fun.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.812
-You want to come in?
-Sure.

09:32.981 --> 09:34.239
I haven't eaten yet,
so I should at least

09:34.390 --> 09:36.800
have wine in my stomach
before I drink.

09:36.968 --> 09:38.318
Okay, no coffee.

09:38.470 --> 09:40.579
No coffee there.
Huge pit stains.

09:40.730 --> 09:42.138
Mmm, maybe we don't need to...

09:42.157 --> 09:44.824
I mean, just out of this world
sized sweat marks.

09:44.976 --> 09:45.992
...comment on that.

09:46.144 --> 09:48.569
But otherwise,
the suit is clean.

09:48.738 --> 09:50.647
And the winner of round one is

09:50.665 --> 09:51.739
Nat Kinkle.

09:51.833 --> 09:53.574
-(crowd cheers)
-Yes!

09:53.594 --> 09:56.836
Hmm, still no reaction
from Jimmy Jr. to my prom texts.

09:56.988 --> 09:58.096
Maybe it's the reception?

09:58.265 --> 09:59.823
I'll just hold the phone up
above my head

09:59.841 --> 10:01.157
and text everything again.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.250
I mean, he's probably
just as obsessed

10:03.270 --> 10:05.345
about a dance three years
from now as you are, right?

10:05.497 --> 10:07.105
Isn't everybody obsessed
with all the dances

10:07.332 --> 10:08.607
they have coming up
in their lives?

10:08.758 --> 10:10.442
I'm excited about
the touchdown dance I have

10:10.593 --> 10:12.627
in case I get drafted
into the NFL.

10:12.629 --> 10:13.761
It's a little emo.

10:13.855 --> 10:15.280
ANNOUNCER:
And now, for round two,

10:15.431 --> 10:17.115
"Flight of the Living Wed."

10:17.342 --> 10:19.008
It's time to take your
two old ladies to the airport

10:19.027 --> 10:21.102
to catch a red-eye flight

10:21.121 --> 10:22.603
to their godson's
destination wedding.

10:22.697 --> 10:25.865
They know the marriage won't
last, but they love a buffet.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.867
Gene, Louise, you're up.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.369
Come on, Doris.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.779
-Let's go be old, I guess.
-I'm Ethel. You're Doris.

10:31.798 --> 10:35.024
And uh-oh, on the way
to the airport there's a...

10:35.043 --> 10:37.543
zombie apocalypse.

10:37.696 --> 10:39.304
Ha-ha! Zombies?

10:39.455 --> 10:40.880
He should've opened with that.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.475
Passengers, you're gonna have to
pop out the moon roof and use

10:43.702 --> 10:45.793
the provided squirt guns
to try to mow down

10:45.812 --> 10:47.203
the most undead Freds.

10:47.296 --> 10:49.439
Yes, pump,
pump, pump, pump, pump.

10:51.801 --> 10:53.467
Blast them, little Belchers.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.486
(whooping)

10:54.713 --> 10:56.154
LOUISE:
I think this is the first time

10:56.305 --> 10:57.897
I've ever felt real joy.

10:58.049 --> 10:59.306
And I'm farting.

10:59.401 --> 11:01.660
Those hot dogs will do that.
Turning on the fan.

11:01.887 --> 11:04.721
Ooh, that's the fancy stuff.

11:04.814 --> 11:06.739
-Pinot Gimme-o.
-Oh, yeah.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.074
Uh, I was saving it for later,

11:08.226 --> 11:09.909
but I guess we might as well
drink it.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.152
I'll go get you a glass.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.337
Get me a mug.

11:12.564 --> 11:14.321
It holds more and won't break
if I bite on it,

11:14.341 --> 11:15.915
like stupid wine glasses.

11:16.067 --> 11:18.176
Okay, not the night
I was expecting,

11:18.403 --> 11:20.753
and I'm gonna have to deep-clean
Gayle's foot fungus

11:20.830 --> 11:22.238
out of the carpet, but...

some Vaseline for my feet?

A bunch of the skin

Ooh, ooh, Linda, mug me.

11:59.294 --> 12:00.777
I'm gonna take
some of this fancy wine

12:00.795 --> 12:01.869
and dip a cracker in it.

12:01.963 --> 12:04.330
Oh, well, you're not
gonna believe this,

12:04.391 --> 12:06.540
but that was the wine company
on the phone.

12:06.634 --> 12:09.802
And it turns out that the
pinot grigio has been recalled.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.730
It's, uh...
it's got poison in it.

12:11.881 --> 12:14.624
See? This is why
I'm getting off liquids.

12:14.642 --> 12:15.975
How much poison we talking?

12:16.127 --> 12:17.902
Linda, you know me.
I can have a little poison.

12:18.054 --> 12:20.129
No, no. Let me give you
some of this red.

12:20.148 --> 12:21.481
But just, like, a glass

12:21.633 --> 12:22.982
'cause I bet in like
five to 30 minutes

12:23.134 --> 12:24.409
we'll be ready
to go home, right?

12:24.636 --> 12:26.560
I know I am,
and I'm already home.

12:26.729 --> 12:27.987
Oh, I know what we could do.

12:28.139 --> 12:29.748
Linda, remember
when we were little

12:29.899 --> 12:31.975
and we used to prank-call
places and say,

12:31.993 --> 12:33.251
"Is there a John there?

12:33.420 --> 12:36.646
A Big John?
Because we have diarrhea."

12:36.739 --> 12:37.905
(laughs)

12:37.924 --> 12:39.907
Oh, yeah,
we did used to do that.

12:40.001 --> 12:41.909
I forgot. But you
can't do that anymore.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.577
Everyone has caller I.D.

12:43.597 --> 12:44.596
-Womp, womp.
-Uh-uh.

12:44.747 --> 12:46.080
You can just do star-six-seven.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.581
You can call any ex-boyfriend

12:47.601 --> 12:50.084
at any time of day or night,
and they won't know it's you

12:50.178 --> 12:51.828
no matter
how many times you call.

12:51.846 --> 12:52.771
Or that's what I heard.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.347
I'll do the first one.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.757
These three sips of wine
are making me wild.

12:56.926 --> 12:58.518
-Give me the phone.
-Oh, call my gym.

12:58.670 --> 13:00.779
They're open 24 hours,
and they're stupid.

13:00.930 --> 13:02.614
They won't let me sleep
on the treadmill.

13:02.765 --> 13:05.024
Uh, yes, hello. This is Sandra.

13:05.176 --> 13:06.934
Is there a John there?

13:07.028 --> 13:08.102
A Big John?

13:08.121 --> 13:12.015
(laughing):
Because I have diarrhea.

13:12.017 --> 13:14.867
-I have dia...
-(laughs) That's good.

13:14.944 --> 13:17.203
(laughing):
It is pretty funny. Diarrhea.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.023
-Do another. Do another.
-Okay. Maybe one more.

13:20.116 --> 13:22.083
I'll do it. Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.

13:22.193 --> 13:24.135
-Go, Louise! Go, Gene!
-(applause)

13:24.362 --> 13:26.395
-I think they're gonna win.
-Oh, uh, yay.

13:26.455 --> 13:28.789
I thought you'd be more into
this zombie apocalypse thing

13:28.809 --> 13:31.292
because of your
not weird zombie thing,

13:31.311 --> 13:33.369
but are you a little bit
too worried about

13:33.388 --> 13:35.555
whether or not Jimmy Jr.
texts you back? Just asking.

13:35.649 --> 13:38.207
-No, I think I'm worrying
the right amount.
-Okay.

13:38.226 --> 13:40.877
I-I mean, it's just this dress
got me thinking about prom

13:40.970 --> 13:42.320
and about going with Jimmy Jr.

13:42.471 --> 13:45.064
And I-I was hoping Jimmy Jr.
would be excited about prom.

13:45.216 --> 13:46.825
He was kind of my prom go-to.

13:46.976 --> 13:48.142
But if he's
not excited about prom,

13:48.236 --> 13:49.977
then I don't know
who I would go with, and...

13:50.055 --> 13:51.830
and-and-and what if no one
asks me to prom?

13:51.981 --> 13:53.147
Oh, well, Tina...

13:53.166 --> 13:54.833
ANNOUNCER:
And now for the final round,

13:55.060 --> 13:57.076
it's "Prom in 60 Seconds,"

13:57.170 --> 13:59.729
when your prom queen
finds out the prom king

13:59.747 --> 14:02.899
has stood her up and
she's all alone in your limo.

14:02.917 --> 14:04.584
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no!

14:04.736 --> 14:05.993
All alone? On prom?

14:06.012 --> 14:07.920
(hyperventilating)

14:08.089 --> 14:10.164
Prom queens, when I say, "Go,"
you must run down the track

14:10.183 --> 14:12.258
and hide behind the trash can
in your lane,

14:12.410 --> 14:14.077
then wait for your driver
to parallel park

14:14.170 --> 14:16.596
in these tiny spaces
marked off by cones,

14:16.690 --> 14:18.022
collect you and physically

14:18.174 --> 14:20.750
carry you back to the limo
to get you to the prom.

14:20.919 --> 14:22.435
-Uh...
-Oh, boy.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.920
You got this, Tina!

14:24.013 --> 14:25.755
This is it!
This is for all the chips!

14:25.773 --> 14:26.939
Wait, there are chips? Where?

14:27.092 --> 14:29.033
-(hyperventilating)
-Tina, you okay?

14:29.185 --> 14:32.445
ANNOUNCER:
And, prom queens, go, go, go.

14:32.614 --> 14:34.747
(exclaiming)

14:36.859 --> 14:39.602
BOB:
Tina? Tina, where are you going?

14:39.621 --> 14:40.620
Stop. Tina?

14:40.714 --> 14:41.695
Tina, no.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.197
Tina!

14:43.216 --> 14:44.365
(laughing)

14:44.459 --> 14:47.368
Well, do you have
a Big John or not, Reggie?

14:47.387 --> 14:48.720
(laughing)

14:48.871 --> 14:50.630
No, it's not Linda Belcher. Bye.

14:50.782 --> 14:52.932
(laughing)

14:54.135 --> 14:56.285
Oh, gosh, is that the time?
I lost track.

14:56.304 --> 14:58.379
Uh, w-we should probably
call it a night, huh?

14:58.473 --> 15:00.064
-Really? Already?
-What? No.

15:00.216 --> 15:01.974
I've only had one mug of wine.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.218
I've gone to my fencing class
drunker than this.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.979
Hey, you know,
I-I-I feel like, um,

15:07.132 --> 15:08.389
maybe I'm getting diarrhea.

15:08.483 --> 15:10.983
All that diarrhea talk
shook something up in there.

15:11.060 --> 15:12.468
Oh, I can feel it coming on.

15:12.487 --> 15:14.487
Oh, gosh, it's moving.
I'm running to the bathroom.

15:14.639 --> 15:16.748
So, uh, just let
yourselves out, okay?

15:16.857 --> 15:17.916
Just go. Go, go, go.

15:18.067 --> 15:20.418
-Okay. We got it.
-All right, I'm leaving.

15:20.645 --> 15:22.662
(phone rings)

15:22.814 --> 15:24.830
Hello? Oh, hi, Ginger.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.983
No, no, I got all the wine
we need, hon.

15:27.001 --> 15:28.575
Okay, I'll see you soon.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.153
Okay. (gasps)

15:30.171 --> 15:33.656
-Who was that?
-Oh, um, no one.

15:33.675 --> 15:35.934
Was that Ginger, Linda?

15:36.085 --> 15:37.418
Is she coming over here now?

15:37.437 --> 15:40.087
Is that why you were trying
to get us out?

15:40.106 --> 15:42.848
-No.
-Wait, Ginger is coming over?

15:43.001 --> 15:45.668
Yeah. Ginger, her real friend.

15:45.687 --> 15:47.019
The wine, the cheese.

15:47.172 --> 15:50.022
None of this was for me,
was it, Linda?

15:50.099 --> 15:51.857
I don't even know
if you do think

15:52.010 --> 15:53.843
my couch is trying to eat me.

15:53.936 --> 15:55.194
I do, Gayle. I do.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.955
Oh, so that's why
you wouldn't let me

15:57.182 --> 15:58.681
have any of the good wine.

15:58.774 --> 16:00.349
You didn't want me to put it
in my garbage mouth.

16:00.443 --> 16:02.201
-I'm not worthy.
-That's right, Gretel.

16:02.353 --> 16:03.035
Gretchen.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.296
No, wait. That's not it. I...

16:05.448 --> 16:07.023
Why couldn't we
hang out with Ginger?

16:07.192 --> 16:08.282
We're not fun enough, Lin?

16:08.301 --> 16:11.194
No, it's just that
Ginger is special.

16:11.212 --> 16:13.379
-Oh.
-Oh, "special Ginger."

16:13.531 --> 16:16.866
La-la-la. We better hurry
so she doesn't see us.

16:16.884 --> 16:19.960
-She'd probably throw up.
-Yeah. We'll get out of the way.

16:19.980 --> 16:23.297
You know, I hope you both
do get diarrhea

16:23.374 --> 16:26.726
so you can bond
over how special it is.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.044
No, guys, wait.

16:28.062 --> 16:29.487
Come on, let's go
to my apartment, Gayle.

16:29.638 --> 16:32.048
I have some tequila someone left
in the hallway we can drink.

16:32.141 --> 16:34.900
(both exclaiming,
falling down stairs)

16:35.053 --> 16:36.160
Oh, my God, what was that?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.054
GRETCHEN:
We both fell down
the stairs a little bit!

16:38.147 --> 16:39.388
-Oh, no.
-(door opens, thuds)
-GAYLE: Ow!

16:39.482 --> 16:40.647
What was that?

16:40.742 --> 16:42.483
GRETCHEN:
I opened the door
into Gayle's head!

16:42.577 --> 16:43.668
What do you care?

16:43.745 --> 16:44.894
Are you okay?
You're okay, right?

16:44.987 --> 16:46.412
It hurts a little.
And my feet itch.

16:46.489 --> 16:49.565
Hurts less than how
you just made her feel, Linda!

16:49.658 --> 16:50.508
Yeah.

16:50.585 --> 16:51.658
-(thud)
-GAYLE: Ow.

16:51.753 --> 16:52.826
GRETCHEN:
Sorry, sorry. We're leaving.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.262
-(door slams)
-Aw, nuts.

16:58.667 --> 16:59.742
Ugh, I feel awful.

Tina? Uh...

17:37.057 --> 17:39.282
A-Are you okay? Can I come in?

17:39.284 --> 17:41.041
Or maybe you could
open the door?

17:41.168 --> 17:42.042
TINA:
No, thank you.

17:42.136 --> 17:43.286
I can't just leave you

17:43.304 --> 17:45.121
in the speedway bathroom
forever, Tina.

17:45.139 --> 17:46.972
It's fine. I can make it work.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.275
Look, I-I know
you're worried about prom.

17:49.460 --> 17:52.052
-In three years from now, but...
-NAT: Hey, Bob.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.738
What's the status?
How's our girl doing?

17:53.889 --> 17:54.980
She-she's okay.

17:55.133 --> 17:56.908
She's just not coming out
of the bathroom.

17:57.135 --> 17:58.559
Hey, Tina, you know,

17:58.578 --> 18:00.411
I guess you could wind up
without a date.

18:00.563 --> 18:02.638
-I could? (hyperventilates)
-W-W-Wait, wait, wait.

18:02.731 --> 18:03.915
I-I... you didn't let me finish.

18:04.142 --> 18:06.158
I was gonna say,
"But I really doubt it."

18:06.252 --> 18:08.311
If, in three years,
you're still this excited

18:08.404 --> 18:10.313
about the prom,
I'm sure you're gonna go

18:10.406 --> 18:11.814
and you're gonna have
a good time,

18:11.833 --> 18:13.257
with or without a date.

18:13.409 --> 18:15.151
I know you'd rather
go with a date,

18:15.169 --> 18:17.428
and that's probably
what's gonna happen because

18:17.580 --> 18:19.764
you're beautiful
and smart and fun,

18:19.991 --> 18:23.083
but if it doesn't happen,
you'll still have a good time

18:23.161 --> 18:26.011
because you'll get a nice dress,
okay, and you'll dance,

18:26.164 --> 18:28.013
and you'll probably drink
a little bit of alcohol,

18:28.166 --> 18:30.182
even though you shouldn't,
and you'll look around

18:30.335 --> 18:31.943
and be like,
"I don't have to see

18:32.170 --> 18:34.170
any of these people ever again
if I don't want to."

18:34.263 --> 18:36.856
You'll have fun because,
Tina, you're fun.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.841
I will? I am?

18:38.860 --> 18:40.767
Yes. Very much.

18:40.845 --> 18:42.870
Okay. I'm gonna come out now.

18:43.698 --> 18:44.864
Sorry, did I ruin the race?

18:44.958 --> 18:46.958
Uh, no. I'm amazing
at parallel parking.

18:47.109 --> 18:49.535
And everyone else isn't, and
they're still trying to do it.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.279
But we should get going now
if we're gonna win this thing.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.298
Okay, what do we do?
Oh, you're picking me up.

18:54.450 --> 18:55.282
Okay, bye, guys.

18:55.526 --> 18:57.117
-Look at her go.
-That's our Tina.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.587
I meant Nat,
but Tina's fine, too.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.457
ANNOUNCER:
And the winner is Nat Kinkle.

19:03.551 --> 19:04.383
(crowd cheering)

19:04.535 --> 19:06.144
-(whooping)
-Yes, we won!

19:06.295 --> 19:07.979
Oh, I have so much
adrenaline right now.

19:08.130 --> 19:09.555
Let's slap each other
in the face.

19:09.724 --> 19:10.723
You want a slap, Dad?

19:10.875 --> 19:12.525
Uh, yeah, I'll take one.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.069
(sighs)

19:16.898 --> 19:19.806
Oh, look, Gayle.
It's Ginger's friend, Linda.

19:19.826 --> 19:20.883
What an honor.

19:20.885 --> 19:22.218
-Can I come in?
-Sure.

19:22.311 --> 19:24.570
-Hi, Gayle.
-Oh, sorry, Linda.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.905
I didn't hear you come in

19:26.057 --> 19:28.240
because we were having
so much fun without you.

19:28.393 --> 19:31.060
Okay, you're both mad at me,
and you should be mad at me.

19:31.153 --> 19:33.153
I was so focused on
my other friend coming over

19:33.173 --> 19:34.413
that I didn't see the friends

19:34.565 --> 19:36.156
that were right in front
of my dumb face.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.584
And I made you feel bad.
And I'm sorry.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.011
Gretchen, you're a great friend.

19:40.238 --> 19:41.737
And-and, Gayle,
you're a great sister.

19:41.906 --> 19:44.182
But am I also your friend?

19:44.333 --> 19:46.184
Gayle, what? Yes.

19:46.411 --> 19:47.576
Just 'cause I love Ginger

19:47.595 --> 19:49.169
and I love to spend time
with her alone

19:49.189 --> 19:51.096
doesn't mean you're not
special to me, too.

19:51.249 --> 19:53.691
You and I have something
I'll never have with her.

19:53.918 --> 19:55.008
We're family.

19:55.102 --> 19:57.253
And there's no stronger bond
than family.

19:57.346 --> 19:59.012
Except maybe if someone
gives you a kidney.

19:59.106 --> 20:00.389
Or an eye. Ooh, spooky.

20:00.391 --> 20:03.426
Aw, Linda. I'd take your eye.
That one.

20:03.444 --> 20:05.444
And... I brought the good wine.

20:05.596 --> 20:06.946
Three mugs coming up.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.356
Actually, is it okay
if we do four?

20:09.450 --> 20:11.116
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, that must be her.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.377
I left a note for Ginger
to meet us over here.

20:13.529 --> 20:15.213
I want all my girlfriends
together tonight.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.531
I don't mind as long as
she's willing to fence me.

20:17.625 --> 20:20.609
I was just about to fence Gayle,
but I'll fence her instead.

20:20.628 --> 20:22.553
You must be Ginger. Hi, hon.

20:22.780 --> 20:24.204
En garde!

20:24.224 --> 20:25.781
It's still pretty early.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.892
We could drive around
and look for another limo race.

20:28.043 --> 20:30.877
-I'm in. Dad?
-(phone rings)

20:30.897 --> 20:32.621
-Hello?
-Hey, Tina. It's Jimmy Jr.

20:32.715 --> 20:36.292
Uh, I just wanted to say hi
and sorry if I missed prom.

20:36.385 --> 20:38.236
Was it tonight?
I think I didn't pay attention

20:38.387 --> 20:39.737
during announcements
or something.

20:39.888 --> 20:41.981
Oh, no.
It's not for three years.

20:42.133 --> 20:43.908
Oh, okay. That's good.

20:44.059 --> 20:46.302
So, um, I'll call you back then?

20:46.320 --> 20:48.137
-Not if I call you first.
-What?

20:48.155 --> 20:50.155
Oh, never mind.
Uh, good night, Jimmy Jr.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.398
I knew they were good texts.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.768
-What?
-Nothing.
I meant to hang up. Bye.

20:53.770 --> 20:55.160
(Linda and friends laughing)

20:55.255 --> 20:57.813
Hey, is that Mom
