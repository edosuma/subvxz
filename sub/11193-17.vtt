WEBVTT

00:30.260 --> 00:33.512
Looks like somebody's closed up
for the winter, hm?

00:54.740 --> 00:55.783
Teal'c?

00:57.018 --> 00:59.229
Is this Goa'uld technology?

00:59.298 --> 01:01.968
These devices are unfamiliar to me.

01:15.899 --> 01:17.775
Oh, this is interesting.

01:17.858 --> 01:21.444
- I wonder what's in there.
- (man) I am in there.

01:37.456 --> 01:39.459
I am unarmed.

01:40.216 --> 01:42.218
Who are you?

01:48.617 --> 01:50.870
You are called Machello, are you not?

01:50.938 --> 01:52.980
Do I know you?

01:53.057 --> 01:57.396
You do not.
But I have seen images of you.

01:57.378 --> 02:02.465
Though your face had not seen
as many years, it was you.

02:04.897 --> 02:09.318
Since before I was born, this man has
been a fugitive from the System Lords.

02:11.137 --> 02:15.015
One of my first assignments as first
prime of Apophis was to hunt this man.

02:15.016 --> 02:17.352
What did he do?

02:17.415 --> 02:20.669
He was developing advanced technology
to battle the Goa'uld.

02:20.697 --> 02:22.699
He was captured and tortured.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.861
The System Lords marked him
to become a Goa'uld host...

02:25.896 --> 02:29.024
so his knowledge could be retained.

02:29.056 --> 02:32.600
Before the implantation ceremony,
he killed some Jaffa and escaped.

02:33.135 --> 02:34.929
He did that?

02:35.014 --> 02:40.896
I am not this person you speak of.
You are mistaken.

02:40.816 --> 02:43.610
Um, you don't have to be afraid.

02:45.336 --> 02:47.045
We're not Goa'ulds.

02:53.055 --> 02:55.057
We're not?

02:58.694 --> 03:01.114
Of course we are not!

03:01.814 --> 03:04.234
But if we are not Goa'ulds...

03:06.375 --> 03:08.168
who are we?

03:12.854 --> 03:16.651
Well, I'm... I'm Daniel Jackson
from the planet Earth.

03:18.334 --> 03:19.919
Yes.

03:20.615 --> 03:22.615
Yes, that's right!

03:22.693 --> 03:26.448
I am Daniel Jackson
from the planet Earth.

03:26.454 --> 03:28.789
Pleased to meet you.

03:31.774 --> 03:34.360
No, I'm... I'm... I'm Daniel Jackson.

03:34.413 --> 03:38.042
No, I am Daniel Jackson.

03:39.574 --> 03:42.784
Uh, these are very interesting machines.

03:42.813 --> 03:45.400
Are they inventions to fight the Goa'uld?

03:45.812 --> 03:49.317
Yes! Inventions to fight the Goa'uld.

03:50.493 --> 03:54.456
Well, do you... do you... Do you think
you could show us how they work?

03:58.772 --> 04:01.776
Are we sure we are not Goa'uld?

04:06.173 --> 04:08.050
You!

04:08.133 --> 04:09.300
You!

04:09.412 --> 04:11.831
You! Here, quickly!

04:12.331 --> 04:15.001
Inventions to fight the Goa'uld.

04:28.292 --> 04:30.336
(buzzing)

04:33.172 --> 04:34.757
Daniel?

04:35.531 --> 04:37.324
I'm fine.

04:37.413 --> 04:38.997
I think.

04:46.651 --> 04:48.571
Are you all right, sir?

04:50.771 --> 04:52.773
He's got a faint pulse.

04:52.851 --> 04:55.437
All right, Carter. Dial us out of here.

04:55.490 --> 04:59.411
Teal'c, grab the gentleman.
Let's take him back to the base.

04:59.411 --> 05:01.413
Yes, sir.

06:08.408 --> 06:10.411
Well, everything seems fine.

06:12.608 --> 06:14.610
Yeah. All your numbers are normal.

06:14.689 --> 06:17.190
Good. I feel fine.

06:17.249 --> 06:21.670
Yeah? You just seem a little out of it,
Daniel. Is something bothering you?

06:21.648 --> 06:23.024
No.

06:23.129 --> 06:24.880
I'm just...

06:25.528 --> 06:27.112
exhausted.

06:27.207 --> 06:32.045
That's not unusual for someone who just
received a high-voltage electric shock.

06:32.007 --> 06:34.009
Any idea what that machine does?

06:36.887 --> 06:41.100
OK. Well, if you are not back to normal
in a couple of days, you let me know.

06:42.048 --> 06:44.050
Uh, wait a minute...

06:44.127 --> 06:46.672
I don't want you driving
for a couple of days.

06:47.528 --> 06:49.737
- All right.
- OK.

06:57.687 --> 06:59.855
How is he?

06:59.927 --> 07:01.928
Not good.

07:04.927 --> 07:08.055
He has severe scar tissue
all over his body.

07:08.086 --> 07:11.173
Looks like he was burned or electrocuted.

07:11.206 --> 07:13.208
My guess is he was tortured.

07:14.166 --> 07:16.711
He's not gonna live much longer, is he?

07:17.485 --> 07:19.029
I don't think so.

07:22.726 --> 07:27.481
Let's continue without Dr Jackson.
Captain Carter, brief us about the device.

07:27.447 --> 07:33.411
Yes, sir. I believe it's some sort of
database for all of Machello's inventions.

07:33.326 --> 07:35.579
The symbols are like icons
on a computer.

07:35.646 --> 07:39.317
When I press one, a schematic diagram
appears with notes on the side.

07:39.326 --> 07:43.038
- Any idea what any of it is?
- Well, sir, that's the problem.

07:43.045 --> 07:45.382
It's not in any dialect that I understand.

07:45.446 --> 07:48.740
I was hoping Daniel or Teal'c
could shed some light on them.

07:55.165 --> 07:57.168
I do not recognise them.

08:01.406 --> 08:02.990
(footsteps)

08:05.444 --> 08:07.863
I apologise.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.661
How are you, Dr Jackson?

08:15.723 --> 08:17.559
Tired.

08:17.644 --> 08:20.689
Dr Fraiser says it'll
wear off in a few days.

08:20.725 --> 08:22.475
I'll be fine.

08:22.564 --> 08:25.610
Daniel, do you recognise
any of these symbols?

08:29.165 --> 08:30.750
No.

08:33.203 --> 08:37.542
Keep trying, people.
This could be some valuable technology.

08:37.524 --> 08:39.527
- Dismissed.
- (Daniel) General.

08:39.604 --> 08:44.232
Dr Fraiser thought
I should go home... get some rest.

08:45.323 --> 08:48.159
- Take a day.
- Thank you.

09:00.123 --> 09:02.125
Thank you. I'll be fine from here.

09:02.202 --> 09:04.205
Yes, sir.

09:29.402 --> 09:33.030
- You called, sir?
- (Machello) Jack, Sam, Teal'c.

09:33.042 --> 09:34.876
Finally.

09:37.562 --> 09:40.649
How does this gentleman
know our names?

09:40.682 --> 09:45.394
As I've been trying to tell the General
and the good doctor here...

09:45.360 --> 09:47.947
I am not Machello.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.253
I am Daniel Jackson.

09:50.321 --> 09:52.532
Oh, here we go.

09:53.361 --> 09:56.030
I realise what I look like...

09:57.520 --> 09:59.731
but I'm telling you...

10:00.321 --> 10:03.073
that machine somehow switched us.

10:03.120 --> 10:06.123
He, uh, knows a lot about Daniel.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.621
(Machello) Ask me anything.

10:08.681 --> 10:11.267
Something only Daniel would know.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.024
OK.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.913
Who's Cassandra?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.669
She's a 12-year-old girl...

10:18.721 --> 10:21.139
we found abandoned on...

10:21.759 --> 10:24.721
P8x-987.

10:26.041 --> 10:27.417
P8x...

10:27.520 --> 10:29.898
987. Yeah.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.961
All right. Lucky guess.

10:33.039 --> 10:35.250
Where was the Stargate found?

10:35.320 --> 10:38.364
At a dig in Giza.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.121
All right. Describe for me...

10:43.280 --> 10:46.866
the dress your sister wore last week
when I took her out.

10:48.039 --> 10:50.459
I don't have a sister, Jack.

10:51.840 --> 10:55.092
And if I did I wouldn't let you near her.

10:58.639 --> 11:00.015
OK.

11:00.119 --> 11:03.538
Let's assume for a moment
that you are Daniel Jackson.

11:03.558 --> 11:06.019
Then who the hell
did we just send home?

11:11.879 --> 11:13.673
Hello, friend.

11:13.759 --> 11:17.763
I am new to this area. I would like
to learn about your culture and customs.

11:17.758 --> 11:19.759
Will you teach me?

11:21.278 --> 11:23.322
Do you not understand me?

11:23.399 --> 11:26.860
- Spare any change, please?
- Why does no one answer me?

11:27.998 --> 11:30.000
Cos you're strange.

11:33.278 --> 11:35.280
Am I?

11:35.759 --> 11:38.219
Tell me how I am strange.

11:38.278 --> 11:42.073
You can't be just walking up to people
you don't know on the street...

11:42.077 --> 11:45.248
and talkin' all weird like that,
askin' for stuff.

11:46.758 --> 11:51.346
- Isn't that what you are doing?
- Well, yeah... but...

11:51.317 --> 11:53.570
Then you must be strange as well.

11:53.638 --> 11:55.972
I've been called worse.

11:56.037 --> 11:58.038
Sure. I'm strange, too.

11:58.957 --> 12:02.419
- I am called Machello.
- I'm Fred.

12:06.236 --> 12:08.322
Let us feast together, Fred...

12:08.397 --> 12:12.860
and celebrate our strangeness
and... new-found friendship.

12:12.836 --> 12:16.883
- On you?
- If that is the custom.

12:16.876 --> 12:19.629
We will feast... on me.

12:19.676 --> 12:21.470
Dr Fraiser?

12:21.557 --> 12:26.937
Medically speaking, he is an elderly man
suffering from acute pulmonary damage...

12:26.876 --> 12:30.129
with the conscious awareness
and memory of Daniel Jackson.

12:30.157 --> 12:31.533
How?

12:31.636 --> 12:34.014
I can't tell you the
method used to do it...

12:34.076 --> 12:37.288
but our personality,
our memory, our conscious selves...

12:37.316 --> 12:40.985
are derived from unique networks
of neurons in the cerebral cortex.

12:40.995 --> 12:44.375
Somehow Daniel's networks
were remapped on to the old man's...

12:44.395 --> 12:46.190
by that alien device.

12:46.277 --> 12:50.405
- So this could be a one-way deal, right?
- I'm not following, sir.

12:50.395 --> 12:55.107
We don't know that it went both ways.
Daniel could still be... Daniel.

12:55.076 --> 12:58.120
His doorman said
he never came into the building.

12:58.155 --> 13:00.283
There you go. Let's find him.

13:00.355 --> 13:02.274
What if he isn't Daniel?

13:02.355 --> 13:05.984
(Hammond) We're going to
have to prepare for that possibility.

13:05.995 --> 13:07.371
Dr Fraiser?

13:08.796 --> 13:12.549
Sir, this problem is beyond my expertise.

13:12.554 --> 13:16.058
Uh, I'm gonna have to consult with
some neurospecialists, sir.

13:16.075 --> 13:18.284
- Do it.
- (O'Neill) General!

13:18.355 --> 13:23.485
Wouldn't it be a little easier if we
just went back, got this... machine...

13:23.434 --> 13:25.437
tried to slam it into reverse.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.600
All right, Colonel. Retrieve it.

13:27.674 --> 13:31.261
But consider that device
hazardous material. Prepare yourself.

13:31.274 --> 13:32.359
Yes, sir.

13:41.754 --> 13:46.258
(Carter) I'll check Machello's room.
He may have electronic books I can read.

13:46.234 --> 13:47.818
(O'Neill) All right.

13:47.913 --> 13:52.418
Uh, Captain, maybe you shouldn't
touch anything in there.

13:52.394 --> 13:54.687
I'll be careful, sir.

14:01.673 --> 14:04.926
(O'Neill) All right.
Let me get mine on first here.

14:10.153 --> 14:12.154
(O'Neill) All right. On three.

14:12.234 --> 14:14.318
One... two...

14:14.393 --> 14:16.394
Colonel!

14:19.192 --> 14:20.778
Captain?

14:20.874 --> 14:24.668
Sorry. Uh, I think I know
how Machello has lived so long.

14:24.673 --> 14:27.216
I think this is some
sort of medical device.

14:27.273 --> 14:31.067
There's all sorts of tubes
that look like they're for life support.

14:31.072 --> 14:32.740
But Machello was conscious.

14:32.831 --> 14:37.169
Maybe it's triggered to deactivate
when someone comes through the gate.

14:37.152 --> 14:41.447
So we can place Daniel in the hibernation
chamber so his body can be maintained.

14:41.432 --> 14:45.226
Yeah, possibly. If I can figure out
how to get it to work again.

14:45.231 --> 14:47.150
How long, Captain?

14:47.232 --> 14:50.778
I don't know, sir. I might not be able
to figure it out at all.

14:50.793 --> 14:54.922
Well, then, let's just get this thing
back to Earth. Might be all we need.

14:56.792 --> 14:58.376
On three.

14:59.230 --> 15:02.192
One, two, three.

15:02.231 --> 15:04.484
(buzzing)

15:10.150 --> 15:11.943
What?

15:21.831 --> 15:25.710
- How did it go, Colonel?
- It did not go well, General Hammond.

15:27.789 --> 15:29.375
You think(?)

15:37.110 --> 15:39.904
This is indeed uncomfortable.

15:41.269 --> 15:44.565
How d'you think I feel, Teal'c?
I've got a snake in my gut!

15:44.590 --> 15:47.259
You've got a comfortable, normal body.

15:48.230 --> 15:50.441
It is normal to you, O'Neill.

15:50.510 --> 15:53.263
Having a symbiote within is normal to me.

15:53.309 --> 15:56.230
Yeah, well, whatever. It's bad, OK?

15:58.869 --> 16:00.245
Hey.

16:00.350 --> 16:04.102
- Have they located Dr Jackson?
- No, they're still looking.

16:04.110 --> 16:07.739
Good news is I found the switching
device on Machello's computer...

16:07.749 --> 16:10.293
but the notations
are in that strange dialect.

16:10.349 --> 16:14.854
You know, when you think about it, it's
actually a good thing that this happened.

16:14.828 --> 16:16.831
I can experiment with you two...

16:16.909 --> 16:21.663
and when we find Daniel - Machello -
we can reverse the process...

16:21.629 --> 16:24.048
assuming, of course, it's reversible.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.861
Captain, can we just get on with this?

16:26.908 --> 16:31.330
Right. Well, I couldn't find
any buttons or switches...

16:31.307 --> 16:35.394
so, unless I've missed something,
it must be triggered by the handles.

16:35.388 --> 16:39.308
I think that we should try
different ways of grasping the handles.

16:39.308 --> 16:42.729
First, try grasping it normally -
the same way you did before.

16:55.467 --> 16:57.511
(buzzing)

17:02.587 --> 17:05.423
Nope. I still got Junior.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.175
All right. Uh...

17:07.267 --> 17:12.855
All right, maybe there's an "in"
and an "out" handle. Switch sides.

17:22.826 --> 17:24.412
(buzzing)

17:30.067 --> 17:32.361
We did not make progress.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.429
OK. Um...

17:35.186 --> 17:39.900
Maybe it has something to do with
the order in which you grab... the handles.

17:51.226 --> 17:53.479
I'm not feeling so hot.

17:55.705 --> 17:57.708
What are you feeling, O'Neill?

18:00.586 --> 18:04.006
All of a sudden,
Junior's moving around a lot in there.

18:04.986 --> 18:10.365
This likely means my body contracted
an illness my symbiote must repair.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.098
Illness?

18:12.184 --> 18:13.769
Great.

18:14.464 --> 18:18.510
It is common.
The symbiote will remedy the problem.

18:18.506 --> 18:21.174
OK. When?

18:21.224 --> 18:26.563
It can only accomplish its work if you put
your body into a state of kelno'reem.

18:26.464 --> 18:28.633
Translation, Teal'c?

18:28.704 --> 18:31.540
Similar to a state of hibernation.

18:31.584 --> 18:34.586
- Meditation?
- Perhaps.

18:34.625 --> 18:38.295
But I sense much deeper
than that of any human meditation.

18:39.903 --> 18:42.824
It is imperative that you do this, O'Neill.

18:42.865 --> 18:46.076
Or my body will be as if
it has no immune system.

18:47.824 --> 18:49.201
OK.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.305
Tell me what to do.

18:58.584 --> 19:00.586
You don't look so good.

19:06.183 --> 19:08.269
I mean I don't look so good.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.486
You will become increasingly ill...

19:11.542 --> 19:14.921
as long as my symbiote
does not have the opportunity...

19:14.942 --> 19:17.362
to make the necessary repair.

19:24.544 --> 19:28.338
So you're telling me
this is just gonna get worse?

19:28.343 --> 19:30.761
If you do not perform kelno'reem...

19:32.022 --> 19:34.025
it could lead to my death.

19:35.942 --> 19:39.529
Rather... your death.

19:43.301 --> 19:45.304
What do I do?

19:45.382 --> 19:48.050
Please... be seated.

20:02.300 --> 20:05.930
- Can I help you?
- Hello. This is Fred. I am Machello.

20:05.942 --> 20:07.943
We wish to feast on me.

20:08.580 --> 20:12.042
In fact, let everyone here feast on me!

20:13.540 --> 20:15.542
You celebrating something?

20:15.622 --> 20:17.624
Indeed we are.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.885
Life.

20:20.461 --> 20:22.046
OK.

20:22.141 --> 20:27.313
- But I'm going to need a credit card.
- (Machello) A credit card...?

20:27.260 --> 20:29.512
Where would I find such a card?

20:30.180 --> 20:32.182
Usually in your wallet.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.701
Will one of these cards do?

20:46.339 --> 20:48.008
Absolutely.

20:51.660 --> 20:55.705
You are one of the most enchanting
women I have seen in my lifetime.

20:55.700 --> 20:57.701
I would be honoured by a kiss.

20:58.778 --> 21:00.573
Yeah, I bet you would.

21:04.739 --> 21:06.740
Very good, O'Neill.

21:07.338 --> 21:09.340
It is?

21:10.180 --> 21:12.682
I'm not feeling any better.

21:12.740 --> 21:15.159
You have not yet reached kelno'reem.

21:16.298 --> 21:18.300
So how do I do it?

21:20.499 --> 21:22.292
Relax.

21:22.377 --> 21:23.962
Concentrate.

21:26.858 --> 21:32.029
You must imagine
the centre of your mind, and focus.

21:34.058 --> 21:37.104
Allow it to take you into a waking sleep.

21:37.939 --> 21:39.941
There you will dream.

21:41.778 --> 21:46.741
When you do so,
it will be in harmony with the symbiote.

21:47.499 --> 21:51.669
Your subconscious minds will be as one.

21:52.298 --> 21:54.298
At that moment...

21:54.777 --> 21:57.154
you will have achieved...

21:57.218 --> 21:59.010
kelno'reem.

22:00.777 --> 22:04.823
Here the symbiote
will receive information...

22:04.817 --> 22:07.862
necessary to repair your sickness.

22:20.817 --> 22:22.527
(sighs)

22:23.376 --> 22:25.171
It's useless.

22:25.257 --> 22:31.096
No, it's not. You've already figured out
it's a mixture of ancient Latin and Greek.

22:31.016 --> 22:35.520
- We're getting closer.
- That's obvious because of the forms.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.450
(sighs)

22:38.537 --> 22:44.375
The alphabets may be the same,
but it's an entirely original language.

22:44.296 --> 22:46.423
There's no sentence structure, no...

22:46.496 --> 22:47.497
(beeping)

22:47.616 --> 22:48.992
Take it easy.

22:53.457 --> 22:55.875
His blood pressure's going up.

23:02.655 --> 23:04.657
He's not responding.

23:06.654 --> 23:10.910
Get a CT and check for haemorrhage,
and get a respirator ready just in case.

23:10.895 --> 23:12.690
Janet?

23:14.776 --> 23:16.778
He's not responsive.

23:16.855 --> 23:18.856
He's in a coma.

23:35.413 --> 23:38.875
Dig in, Machello, before the hot fudge
melts all the ice cream.

23:54.054 --> 23:58.932
So, uh... I get the feeling
you fought in the Gulf. Am I right?

23:58.894 --> 24:00.479
No.

24:02.534 --> 24:04.536
But I was a soldier.

24:04.614 --> 24:06.907
I fought many battles.

24:06.973 --> 24:08.976
I was captured and tortured.

24:09.733 --> 24:11.736
That explains a lot.

24:13.012 --> 24:17.476
I continued to fight,
and lost all that I loved and cared for.

24:19.053 --> 24:21.137
But I knew I could not surrender.

24:21.212 --> 24:22.923
For you.

24:24.374 --> 24:28.252
If it were not for me,
you would all be conquered by now.

24:28.252 --> 24:31.298
(laughs) By who? Saddam?

24:35.653 --> 24:38.323
He is not a System Lord
I am familiar with.

24:39.012 --> 24:41.682
But several others
would have wiped you out.

24:42.932 --> 24:44.518
Whatever you say, man.

24:47.572 --> 24:49.365
(screeching tyres)

24:52.172 --> 24:55.134
But I do not wish to fight any longer.

24:55.171 --> 25:00.926
From now on I only want to eat burgers
and French fries and ice-cream sundaes.

25:00.852 --> 25:03.770
And I want to be
with good people like you, Fred.

25:03.810 --> 25:06.355
All good things come to an end, Machello.

25:06.411 --> 25:08.204
Oh, no, my friend.

25:08.290 --> 25:11.001
Only evil things must come to an end.

25:11.050 --> 25:13.761
For good things, such as ourselves...

25:13.810 --> 25:17.022
it is possible to go on for ever.

25:18.010 --> 25:19.387
Cool.

25:25.771 --> 25:27.565
Whoa!

25:29.609 --> 25:31.194
Sweet.

25:31.289 --> 25:33.291
(cutting)

25:36.931 --> 25:38.723
Teal'c?

25:45.329 --> 25:47.332
What are you doing?

25:50.651 --> 25:55.363
If I am to remain in this body,
I must shave my head.

25:55.329 --> 25:57.457
You're making a joke, right?

25:57.528 --> 25:59.655
I am not joking.

25:59.730 --> 26:02.023
Teal'c, you will not shave my head!

26:02.089 --> 26:04.968
It is presently my head, O'Neill.

26:05.009 --> 26:06.803
Teal'c, this is temporary.

26:06.890 --> 26:09.099
And if it is not?

26:10.210 --> 26:12.921
Just give 'em a chance to find Daniel, OK?

26:15.490 --> 26:17.909
Teal'c, I'm going to see
General Hammond.

26:17.970 --> 26:22.598
Promise me you won't touch the head
until I get back.

26:40.489 --> 26:43.951
Sir, I feel like I need to be involved
in finding Daniel.

26:43.968 --> 26:47.971
We may have him soon. Daniel's
credit card was just used in a local diner.

26:47.968 --> 26:50.721
- Request permission to go there, sir.
- Denied.

26:50.768 --> 26:53.686
You'll remain here until they bring him in.

26:53.729 --> 26:56.065
Be patient, Colonel.

26:57.528 --> 27:00.030
I can't be patient, sir.

27:00.087 --> 27:02.507
Daniel is dying.

27:02.567 --> 27:08.281
I'd rather we get to Machello than risk
some yahoo civvy officer shooting him.

27:08.967 --> 27:10.969
Much as I'd like to...

27:11.647 --> 27:13.650
you're not exactly yourself.

27:17.488 --> 27:19.281
Request denied.

27:21.208 --> 27:25.045
It has been a lifetime since
I've enjoyed such companionship, Fred.

27:25.048 --> 27:27.884
- I have truly enjoyed it.
- Likewise.

27:36.086 --> 27:39.548
How does one court a wife, Fred?

27:39.567 --> 27:43.820
Usually with lots of time, energy,
and those credit cards.

27:43.807 --> 27:45.599
Good.

27:45.685 --> 27:48.355
- Let us begin now.
- Hold it there, buddy.

27:51.287 --> 27:54.999
I will not go back. It is impossible.

27:55.007 --> 27:58.093
- Put your hands behind your head.
- (sirens)

27:58.125 --> 28:01.211
Do it, Machello.
You don't know these cops like me.

28:03.046 --> 28:05.464
Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't shoot him, man!

28:06.326 --> 28:08.536
He's a hero!

28:15.125 --> 28:17.711
(Fred) Oh, don't hurt him.

28:20.165 --> 28:23.419
You were right, Fred.
All good things do come to an end.

28:36.723 --> 28:38.518
(sighs)

28:41.204 --> 28:43.248
Come on, Daniel.

28:43.325 --> 28:47.371
They found the guy. They're bringing
him in. You have to wake up.

28:58.285 --> 29:00.077
Daniel.

29:01.003 --> 29:03.006
You can't die on me now.

29:06.844 --> 29:08.804
It's...

29:08.883 --> 29:13.261
nice to know you don't just
like me for my looks.

29:14.923 --> 29:16.925
Hey...

29:19.443 --> 29:21.403
(footsteps)

29:21.482 --> 29:23.484
Janet.

29:28.364 --> 29:31.115
Well, it is good to have you back,
Dr Jackson.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.565
You have impeccable timing.

29:36.202 --> 29:39.539
Sam, they're on their way in.
We should get that machine in here.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.020
Reverse what you've done to my people.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.493
I cannot do what is impossible.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.230
Then you won't cooperate?

30:15.281 --> 30:17.867
On the contrary, I am
telling you the truth.

30:17.922 --> 30:20.840
- It is not possible.
- Why not?

30:24.560 --> 30:29.148
In simplest terms, the device retains
a memory of every transference.

30:29.121 --> 30:31.330
For the very reason you are asking me...

30:31.401 --> 30:36.740
I designed it so that it encrypts
the transference, blocking any reversal.

30:36.681 --> 30:39.349
Then reprogramme it so it will unblock it.

30:39.361 --> 30:42.029
You do not have
the necessary technology.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.971
Even if I wanted to change it...

30:49.720 --> 30:51.721
I could not.

31:07.318 --> 31:10.905
- Thank you for coming.
- (Carter) Hope you like the scenery.

31:10.919 --> 31:13.212
It's your only view for
the rest of your life.

31:14.680 --> 31:17.098
Yes. That is why I called you.

31:17.159 --> 31:21.247
I thought perhaps I might be able
to negotiate for better accommodations.

31:22.199 --> 31:24.201
We're listening.

31:26.519 --> 31:31.982
First, let me apologise for the unfortunate
transference of the colonel and the Jaffa.

31:31.917 --> 31:33.920
Just get to the point.

31:38.439 --> 31:42.276
The symbols you've no doubt
tried to decipher are unique.

31:42.279 --> 31:47.617
In form, they're similar to my language,
but they're actually a code I devised...

31:47.518 --> 31:50.104
in case my work
came into enemy hands.

31:51.719 --> 31:55.388
We're not your enemy.
If anything, we're allies.

31:56.877 --> 31:59.963
That is why I will teach
Captain Carter that code.

31:59.998 --> 32:01.790
With my knowledge...

32:01.877 --> 32:05.882
not only will you be able to
defend yourselves against the Goa'uld...

32:05.877 --> 32:08.422
you will in fact be able to defeat them.

32:08.478 --> 32:10.480
And our cost for this knowledge?

32:12.518 --> 32:14.519
My freedom, of course.

32:16.077 --> 32:19.582
- And Dr Jackson?
- (Machello) He is not an issue.

32:19.597 --> 32:21.599
Not an issue?!

32:21.676 --> 32:24.180
We're talking about a friend's life.

32:24.237 --> 32:28.324
Your friend was my solution
to hiding my face permanently.

32:28.317 --> 32:30.987
Consider him a casualty of war.

32:31.796 --> 32:35.592
I am offering you
the salvation of your planet.

32:35.596 --> 32:40.643
Is this not worth more than
the life of one archaeologist?

32:40.596 --> 32:44.224
I don't know about
the customs of your planet...

32:44.236 --> 32:48.949
but here on Earth
the value of a life is priceless.

32:49.957 --> 32:53.751
I want you to get to know your casualty.

33:07.355 --> 33:10.025
I believe you two have met.

33:11.635 --> 33:17.808
Well, from what I can see,
you're looking... good.

33:18.954 --> 33:21.165
What would you like me to say?

33:22.674 --> 33:24.469
I am sorry?

33:24.555 --> 33:27.557
That I wish I could undo it?

33:27.595 --> 33:29.596
I do not.

33:32.115 --> 33:33.907
Why?

33:33.994 --> 33:35.829
Why?

33:35.914 --> 33:38.041
Because I earned it.

33:38.115 --> 33:40.241
That is why.

33:40.314 --> 33:45.443
I earned it because I sacrificed my life
for you and your people.

33:47.595 --> 33:51.056
The least you could do
was compensate me with another.

33:53.595 --> 33:58.266
What right do you have
to judge the value of my life?

33:58.234 --> 34:03.155
I have suffered more than anyone
should suffer in a lifetime.

34:03.114 --> 34:08.119
For 50 years I fought against the Goa'uld.

34:08.074 --> 34:11.869
Then I was betrayed by my wife...

34:11.873 --> 34:15.543
whom they secretly turned into a host.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.556
So was mine.

34:19.313 --> 34:21.315
She is still with them.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.103
At least you still have a planet...

34:24.152 --> 34:26.155
and friends.

34:26.233 --> 34:32.655
Two billion of my people died
rather than surrender me to the Goa'uld.

34:38.672 --> 34:41.925
You have made great sacrifices.

34:44.074 --> 34:47.452
We owe you... gratitude.

34:50.911 --> 34:56.333
But still it does not give you the right
to take another's life.

34:56.271 --> 35:00.610
If you had the technology,
you would do the same.

35:00.592 --> 35:02.802
No, I wouldn't...

35:03.552 --> 35:07.806
because then I would become
no better than the Goa'uld.

35:08.152 --> 35:10.362
I am not a Goa'uld!

35:11.512 --> 35:14.181
I hate the Goa'uld.

35:14.231 --> 35:20.405
The Goa'uld use hosts because
they think they are better than humans.

35:21.070 --> 35:24.199
Because they believe they deserve it.

35:27.791 --> 35:30.210
You're a Goa'uld, Machello.

35:31.710 --> 35:34.755
I am nothing but a host to you.

35:35.990 --> 35:38.409
I am not a Goa'uld.

35:38.911 --> 35:41.873
My wife is still alive.

35:41.909 --> 35:45.371
There's a chance I could still save her.

35:46.949 --> 35:49.911
You are stealing that chance.

35:51.351 --> 35:54.021
Even if you still had this body...

35:54.831 --> 35:57.583
you will never find her.

35:58.630 --> 36:00.967
I will find her...

36:01.030 --> 36:03.532
I will find...

36:07.431 --> 36:09.932
- (continuous beep)
- (Dr Fraiser) He's in defib!

36:12.429 --> 36:14.431
Prepare the paddles!

36:19.389 --> 36:21.391
Come on, Daniel.

36:39.068 --> 36:42.614
Wait a minute. I've got a heartbeat,
but I don't know for how long.

36:44.750 --> 36:46.710
Give me one mil epi!

36:46.789 --> 36:50.583
If I could trade places
with him again, I would...

36:50.588 --> 36:53.842
but unfortunately
I am the only one who cannot.

36:55.268 --> 36:58.688
Wait a minute.
You're the only one who can't?

36:59.588 --> 37:00.965
Yes.

37:02.547 --> 37:04.759
Get Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c.

37:12.668 --> 37:16.297
- What's going on, Captain?
- I may have a solution to this mess.

37:16.307 --> 37:17.684
Finally.

37:18.347 --> 37:20.557
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

37:20.626 --> 37:24.965
All right. It's a little complicated,
so I need you to do exactly as I say.

37:24.947 --> 37:28.867
We're gonna have to play
a little musical chairs with your bodies.

37:28.867 --> 37:31.244
First, Colonel,
you and Machello must switch.

37:33.907 --> 37:36.034
Trust me, Colonel.

37:45.266 --> 37:47.643
(buzzing)

37:50.027 --> 37:52.570
Colonel?

37:52.626 --> 37:54.003
I'm here.

37:54.106 --> 37:56.275
How do you feel physically?

37:57.826 --> 37:59.577
Peachy.

37:59.666 --> 38:03.128
The transference was successful.
Physically we are fine.

38:03.146 --> 38:05.858
- Please continue, Captain.
- All right.

38:07.186 --> 38:11.148
Now you and Daniel should switch.

38:30.346 --> 38:32.764
(buzzing)

38:33.905 --> 38:35.697
Wow!

38:36.744 --> 38:38.704
What a dream!

38:38.784 --> 38:40.579
What happened?

38:40.664 --> 38:44.710
I don't have time to explain right now,
Daniel. Just bear with me.

38:45.224 --> 38:46.599
OK.

38:46.704 --> 38:48.916
Danny boy?

38:48.985 --> 38:50.735
Jack?

38:54.184 --> 38:56.353
I wish I had time
to teach you the symbols.

38:57.585 --> 39:00.628
In your hands my inventions
could fight the Goa'uld.

39:01.664 --> 39:04.126
It's all right. I'll figure it out. Please.

39:17.943 --> 39:20.780
(buzzing)

39:25.023 --> 39:27.025
I am myself again.

39:30.063 --> 39:32.525
Thank you, Captain Carter.

39:32.583 --> 39:33.835
Any time.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.385
Our turn.

39:52.422 --> 39:55.092
(buzzing)

40:00.782 --> 40:02.784
Yes! Yes!

40:04.621 --> 40:06.623
Shave my head?!

40:08.061 --> 40:10.063
Gee...

40:10.860 --> 40:12.862
I'm back.

40:15.382 --> 40:17.800
He's conscious again.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.943
Thank you...

40:26.702 --> 40:29.079
for my holiday.

40:34.661 --> 40:36.996
(continuous beep)

41:04.500 --> 41:06.501
Welcome back, SG-1.
