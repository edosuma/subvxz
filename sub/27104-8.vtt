WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.633
-(laughter)
-You know the saying,

00:07.675 --> 00:08.801
"Walk a mile in a man's shoes"?

00:08.843 --> 00:10.219
I mean, think about that.

00:10.261 --> 00:12.138
The perspective that gives you.

00:12.179 --> 00:15.141
Well, I took it to heart, put
on a pair of my husband's shoes,

00:15.182 --> 00:17.560
and, my God,
were they comfortable.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.895
I get it now,
why men rule the world--

00:19.937 --> 00:21.230
no high heels.

00:21.272 --> 00:23.232
They can walk faster,

00:23.274 --> 00:24.900
and their backs don't hurt.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.569
I'm divorcing my husband,

00:26.610 --> 00:29.321
but I am keeping
the fucking shoes.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.157
Thank you, everybody.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.743
I'm Mrs. Maisel. I'm on the road
the next few days,

00:33.784 --> 00:35.745
but, unlike your innocence,
I'll be back.

00:35.786 --> 00:38.038
-Good night!
-(cheering and applause)

00:40.249 --> 00:41.876
-(music playing)
-Great set.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.544
Hey, thanks.

00:43.586 --> 00:45.045
I can never tell if
they're talking about the boobs

00:45.087 --> 00:47.465
-or the comedy.
-That guy was a dancer
in Pal Joey.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.216
He wasn't talking
about your boobs.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.552
-Hi.
-Hi there.

00:51.594 --> 00:54.138
-Uh, what is she doing?
-I don't know.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.724
Ooh. It's a pen.

00:56.766 --> 00:59.018
-Oh, she wants your autograph.
-Really?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.770
Wow.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.647
This is really cool.

01:04.690 --> 01:05.649
How's it look?

01:05.691 --> 01:06.942
Lose the heart.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.194
Really?
Doesn't make it stand out?

01:08.235 --> 01:09.779
No, it makes it look
like a third grader signed it.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.489
Okay.
(clears throat)

01:12.740 --> 01:14.533
Here.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.118
And thanks.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.745
Thank you.

01:19.038 --> 01:20.831
I just signed
my first autograph.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.416
-And check this out.
-Hmm.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.418
Our first road itinerary.
Let's go over it.

01:24.460 --> 01:25.920
Not necessary,
I know it by heart.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.421
Days one and two, D.C.

01:27.463 --> 01:28.672
Day three, Philly.

01:28.714 --> 01:30.257
Day four, Harrisburg.

01:30.299 --> 01:33.010
Day five, back home for the gig
at the new club on 23rd.

01:33.052 --> 01:35.679
Oh. Okay. I mean,
I typed it up all fancy.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.765
One for each of us.
Even fixed my "S" key.

01:37.807 --> 01:39.683
-But you don't need it.
-No, no, no, let me see it.

01:39.725 --> 01:42.061
-I'll just use it
as toilet paper.
-Let me see it.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.481
-You spelled "itinerary" wrong.
-Damn.

01:45.523 --> 01:46.982
It's impressive.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.734
Just remember
the most important part:

01:48.776 --> 01:50.069
day one, tomorrow,

01:50.110 --> 01:52.154
depart New York City
1:30 p.m. sharp.

01:52.196 --> 01:54.073
-Got it?
-I will not be late.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.243
Okay, I got Montana,

01:57.284 --> 01:59.829
North Carolina, Utah,

01:59.870 --> 02:01.664
-Wisconsin...
-We'll do this later, Jackie.

02:01.705 --> 02:02.832
Do what? What is this?

02:02.873 --> 02:04.458
The plates for you to switch
on the car.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.876
Why are we switching
the plates on the car?

02:05.918 --> 02:07.753
Well, it-it's
technically stolen.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.004
There's nothing technical
about it.

02:09.046 --> 02:10.381
It's fucking stolen.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.466
I like Utah.
They'll think you're Mormon

02:12.508 --> 02:14.677
and leave you alone.
I mean, no one talks to Mormons

02:14.718 --> 02:15.928
unless they have to.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.513
-You said
it's your mother's car.
-It is.

02:17.555 --> 02:19.265
You stole your mother's car?

02:19.306 --> 02:21.267
Hey, she stole my childhood.
I think we're even.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.935
What if we're pulled over
and they run our plates?

02:22.977 --> 02:24.854
-I'll handle it.
-Great plan.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.106
We'll just cross our fingers
and hope for the best.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.774
It's how I live my life--

02:28.816 --> 02:31.151
just sort of half-assed
and completely random.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.820
I want no part of this, okay?

02:32.862 --> 02:34.989
Fine. Have no part of it.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.407
Take Wyoming.

02:36.448 --> 02:37.825
SUSIE:
Wyoming? Why?

02:37.867 --> 02:40.244
Wyoming's full of cowboys
and tough hombres,

02:40.286 --> 02:41.745
and cops are less likely
to pull us over

02:41.787 --> 02:43.330
'cause they won't want
to mess with us.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.457
Plus, it's got a horse,
and I like the horse.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.667
I had a feeling that was it.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.335
So, 1:30 tomorrow.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.504
1:30. See ya, partner.

02:50.546 --> 02:53.007
Pew, pew.
(blows)

02:53.048 --> 02:54.258
Lose Wyoming.

02:57.595 --> 03:00.556
("Oomp Waddle Dickie Duck"
playing)

03:00.598 --> 03:03.809
♪ Dickie the duck went out
walking one day ♪

03:03.851 --> 03:07.980
♪ He wanted some ducks
to come over and play ♪

03:08.022 --> 03:10.983
♪ He quack, quack, quack,

03:11.025 --> 03:12.568
You tire of Chopin?

03:12.610 --> 03:15.571
No, I like Chopin very much.

03:15.613 --> 03:17.239
What are you doing?

03:17.281 --> 03:19.992
Working. Or trying to.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.411
You do know
that's Ethan's record.

03:22.453 --> 03:25.623
Hence the references
to "Ducky Waddles ha ha ha."

03:25.664 --> 03:27.833
-(music stops)
-Don't you have some dirty jokes

03:27.875 --> 03:29.501
-to go tell?
-Told 'em.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.211
So, whatcha doin'?

03:31.253 --> 03:33.923
Our Bell Labs
speech synthesis team

03:33.964 --> 03:35.799
is going to be the first
in the world

03:35.841 --> 03:38.177
to teach a computer to sing.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.512
But I need to find
precisely the right song.

03:40.554 --> 03:44.350
It has to have a simple melody
with a maximum one-octave range

03:44.391 --> 03:48.020
and, ideally, very few
diphthongs in the lyrics.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.105
Ethan's records are perfect.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.899
You're not gonna want that one.

03:51.941 --> 03:53.192
It's just barnyard sounds.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.401
Oh.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.862
I signed
my first autograph tonight.

03:56.904 --> 04:00.115
A complete stranger asked you
to put your signature down

04:00.157 --> 04:02.201
on a piece of paper
and you did it?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.370
Yes. She was very excited, too.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.246
Well, of course she was.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.249
Now she can forge your signature
on a check.

04:10.459 --> 04:13.837
It was a really good show
tonight.

04:13.879 --> 04:17.007
You know,
when you saw me at the Concord,

04:17.049 --> 04:21.011
it wasn't exactly
my regular act, Papa.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.931
I saw you, and...
I got nervous.

04:23.973 --> 04:25.140
You made me nervous.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.976
And that made you vulgar?

04:27.017 --> 04:28.727
No. I just...

04:28.769 --> 04:31.397
I have a gig in the city
when I get back.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.483
Nearby. Nice club.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.360
Maybe you'd like to come.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.696
-It's too far.
-Nearby is too far?

04:38.737 --> 04:40.406
I mean I'm very busy.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.741
I just think
if you saw me at a normal gig,

04:42.783 --> 04:44.493
you might feel better about it.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.161
Don't worry about me.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.247
How about Mama?
How's she feeling?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.916
Marry Benjamin,
and everything will be fine.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.501
I don't know if I'm going
to marry Benjamin.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.461
Marry somebody,
and everything will be fine.

04:54.503 --> 04:55.879
-Okay.
-To be clear,

04:55.921 --> 04:58.298
I mean marry somebody
at city hall.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.300
I'm not going to pay
for fake snow

05:00.342 --> 05:02.302
and papier-mâché reindeer again.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.722
$400 for embroidered yarmulkes

05:04.763 --> 05:06.890
that say
"Midge and Joel forever."

05:06.932 --> 05:09.143
Explain that to an orphan.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.186
If I see one, I will.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.231
I'm sorry, Papa.

05:14.273 --> 05:17.860
I know that all this stuff
with me, with Noah...

05:17.901 --> 05:19.361
Miriam, please,

05:19.403 --> 05:20.863
I have no time to concern myself

05:20.904 --> 05:22.948
with my children's
feckless behavior.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.368
I'm a man of science,
engaged in complex research

05:26.410 --> 05:27.870
at the highest levels

05:27.911 --> 05:31.665
on incredibly important
scientific matters.

05:50.768 --> 05:53.395
There's a fair amount
that works in this one.

05:53.437 --> 05:57.232
Unfortunately, computers
don't use the bathroom.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.650
Yet.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.278

06:04.406 --> 06:06.533
I have no idea what to get.
I haven't been out of the house

06:06.575 --> 06:08.368
in a month.
Archie's mother keeps sending us

06:08.410 --> 06:10.579
corned beef and cabbage.
The whole apartment building

06:10.621 --> 06:11.830
smells like Downtown Dublin.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.582
Well, order as much as you want.
It's all on me.

06:13.624 --> 06:16.710
This is a purely guilt-motivated
"I'm sorry" lunch.

06:16.752 --> 06:18.879
I love your quaint
Jewish traditions.

06:18.921 --> 06:21.131
-Ooh, who's that?
-Oscar Udenosky.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.050
-Is he famous?
-He's a dentist.

06:23.092 --> 06:25.052
Oh. I thought he was famous.

06:25.094 --> 06:26.053
What's kishka?

06:26.095 --> 06:27.221
Jewish haggis.

06:27.262 --> 06:29.556
No, thank you. Oh, who's that?

06:29.598 --> 06:31.391
-Bertha Frisk.
-Is she famous?

06:31.433 --> 06:33.268
She's the bingo queen
of St. Mary's. Does that count?

06:33.310 --> 06:35.145
I thought there were going
to be famous people here.

06:35.187 --> 06:36.814
It is called the Stage Deli,

06:36.855 --> 06:39.274
not the Boring
Everyone Normal Eats Here Deli.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.318
-Couldn't get all those letters
on the sign.
-I was hoping it would be

06:41.360 --> 06:42.736
like when Lucy went
to the Brown Derby

06:42.778 --> 06:44.238
and saw William Holden
and got so nervous

06:44.279 --> 06:45.572
she buttered her hand
instead of her bread.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.157
I can see a dentist at Lindy's.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.992
I need some excitement.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.410
Excitement. Okay.

06:51.662 --> 06:54.373
Oh. See that guy over there
in the gray suit?

06:54.414 --> 06:56.792
Marty Segal. Yesterday,
he scored his first Copa gig.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.877
-Big, big deal.
-Huh.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.295
He just spilled coffee
on his suit.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.797
Does the Copa know about that?

07:01.839 --> 07:03.423
That may be his opening bit.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.218
Gregory Peck came in once.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.386
-He did?
-Came in

07:07.427 --> 07:08.762
and ate lunch.
Right over there.

07:08.804 --> 07:10.514
No. Are you lying? Never mind.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.850
Don't care.
I love Gregory Peck.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.143
Congratulations on the Copa.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.644
Put some club soda
on that, Marty.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.271
What can I get for you two?

07:17.312 --> 07:18.856
Oh, shoot.
I haven't finished looking.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.608
Allow me. Verla,
my dear friend Imogene here

07:21.650 --> 07:23.527
will have
the hot pastrami Reuben on rye,

07:23.569 --> 07:25.863
chicken in a pot, potato knish,

07:25.904 --> 07:28.031
matzo ball soup, cheese Danish,

07:28.073 --> 07:30.033
a lime rickey, and a couple
of black-and-whites for dessert.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.452
-And some Bromo-Seltzer to go?
-You bet.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.037
Coming right up.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.789
That's exactly what
Gregory Peck ordered.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.374
No. Are you lying? Never mind.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.042
Don't care.
This is so exciting.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.794
-Hey, Midge.
-Hey, Eugene.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.171
How'd the Florida gig go?

07:42.212 --> 07:43.463
I did ten minutes
on bad shellfish.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.090
The place went nuts.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.051
Oh, you never told me
Grace Kelly was your friend.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.095
Easy, boy.
Those tits are just temporary.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.847
-(gasps)
-Oh, sorry.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.557
Congratulations.

07:57.311 --> 08:00.814
-What?
-(whispers): I can't believe
what you said. In a restaurant.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.816
Oh, he's a comic.
Th-That's just how we talk.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.027
It's just I've never heard you--
Oh, my. He looked at my...

08:05.068 --> 08:06.445
He didn't mean anything by it
except that your boobs

08:06.486 --> 08:08.739
are enormous. And they are.
Mazel tov.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.240
Oh, my God. A man looked at my--

08:10.282 --> 08:11.783
I should tell Archie.
Should I tell Archie?

08:11.825 --> 08:12.993
Deep breaths, honey.

08:13.035 --> 08:14.536
And I have never heard you
talk like that before.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.038
-I'm sorry.
-Midge,

08:16.079 --> 08:17.122
you cannot do that at my shower.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.208
If my mother heard you say
T-I-T-S,

08:19.249 --> 08:20.959
she would-- well,
she might not do anything

08:21.001 --> 08:22.127
because she won't know
what you're talking about,

08:22.169 --> 08:23.754
-but please don't.
-Imogene,

08:23.795 --> 08:26.131
I promise, I am throwing
the most beautiful baby shower

08:26.173 --> 08:27.966
in the world
for my very best friend.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.053
And, I promise, I will be
on my very best behavior.

08:31.094 --> 08:34.139
Okay. Okay.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.807
So, did Gregory Peck
really eat over there?

08:35.849 --> 08:38.227
And Cary Grant joined him
for dessert.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.604
(bell dings)

08:40.646 --> 08:43.023
This car is unkempt,
to say the least.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.775
Hey, lady,
I could use another hand.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.361
I have to make sure nothing back
here gets crushed and wrinkled.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.780
Who knows if they have irons
where we're headed?

08:49.821 --> 08:51.782
Ah! Motherfucker!

08:51.823 --> 08:54.201
Fuck my mother!

08:54.243 --> 08:55.410
Hey, what the hell?

08:55.452 --> 08:56.828
Oh. Did you need that?

08:56.870 --> 08:57.913
That's my shit.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.039
-It is? In that?
-Yes.

08:59.081 --> 09:00.082
Just because it's not wrapped

09:00.123 --> 09:01.500
in a pink box
like some party cake

09:01.541 --> 09:02.751
doesn't make it garbage.

09:02.793 --> 09:03.752
Why didn't you bring a suitcase?

09:03.794 --> 09:04.795
I don't have one.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.088
What do you use for vacations?

09:06.129 --> 09:07.506
-My imagination?
-Sorry,

09:07.547 --> 09:08.590
I thought your stuff
was packed

09:08.632 --> 09:09.675
in the little suitcase
in the back.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.593
Ah. The suitcase thing's
a tape recorder.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.345
I'm gonna tape
all your road sets

09:13.387 --> 09:15.013
so we can study 'em
when we get back.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.682
-That's a great idea.
-Thanks.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.517
Here's another one.
Stop sounding so surprised

09:18.558 --> 09:19.768
when I have a great idea.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.270
Now, please,
just hold the plate up.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.896
-The screw won't go in.
-No way.

09:22.938 --> 09:25.232
I have two priors.
I can't risk another arrest.

09:25.274 --> 09:27.484
Never mind. Just go over
your set for tonight.

09:27.526 --> 09:30.153
Oh, I have been.
Do you think I can do the bit

09:30.195 --> 09:31.571
about Eisenhower's penis in D.C.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.240
or will the Secret Service
not like it?

09:33.282 --> 09:35.951
-I could say "sausage."
-Eh, they'll know
you mean "penis."

09:35.993 --> 09:37.744
Maybe I'll say "penis"
but not "Eisenhower's penis."

09:37.786 --> 09:39.788
I'll put "Eisenhower's penis"
in the Philadelphia set.

09:39.830 --> 09:43.333
I think Eisenhower's penis is
a slam dunk wherever you put it.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.295
Okay.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.713
America, here we come.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.339
Great. Lift your ass.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.966
-I'm sorry?
-You got to lift your ass

09:51.008 --> 09:52.634
-or the car won't start.
-Are you kidding me?

09:52.676 --> 09:54.136
-No.
-Why?

09:54.177 --> 09:56.555
Am I a mechanic?
Just pick it up so we can go.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.140
I do a version of this

09:58.181 --> 09:59.391
-in my Helena Rubinstein class.
-(engine starts)

09:59.433 --> 10:01.393
Good for the thighs.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.312
-Can I put my butt down now?
-Almost.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.564
-The car's moving.
-Few more seconds.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.399
You're just screwing
with me now, aren't you?

10:07.441 --> 10:10.402
Yep. The Eisenhower penis tour
has begun.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.904
-Mm.
-(honks horn)

10:12.946 --> 10:15.866
♪ I'm gonna ♪

10:15.907 --> 10:17.826
♪ Live till I die ♪

10:17.868 --> 10:20.829
♪ I'm gonna laugh
'stead of cry ♪

10:20.871 --> 10:23.832
♪ I'm gonna take the town
and turn it upside down ♪

10:23.874 --> 10:26.418
♪ I'm gonna live, live, live

10:26.460 --> 10:27.753
♪ They're gonna say ♪

10:27.794 --> 10:30.839
Is Senator Kennedy running
for president, do we think?

10:30.881 --> 10:32.674
-(scattered agreement)
-It's up to Jackie.

10:32.716 --> 10:35.177
You know she wears the pants
in that family.

10:35.218 --> 10:38.096
-(laughter)
-And she wears them well.
Seriously,

10:38.138 --> 10:40.891
have you seen how easily
that woman wears linen pants?

10:40.932 --> 10:42.559
Linen.
The material that wrinkles

10:42.601 --> 10:44.394
while you're ironing it.

10:44.436 --> 10:48.398
I believe the Kennedys
will stand up for Americans.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.484
Because, really, if Jackie
sits down for ten seconds,

10:50.525 --> 10:51.943
that whole outfit goes to shit.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.613
-(laughter)
-I hope he runs,

10:54.654 --> 10:55.864
because he'll restore
the science funding

10:55.906 --> 10:57.074
that Eisenhower cut.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.617
Science is big in my family

10:58.658 --> 11:01.078
because my father works
at Bell Labs.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.497
And I was very excited
when he got this job.

11:03.538 --> 11:07.584
The greatest scientific minds in
the world all in one building,

11:07.626 --> 11:09.669
solving the world's problems.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.171
I came home the other day
and found him listening

11:11.213 --> 11:12.464
to my four-year-old's record,

11:12.506 --> 11:14.007
a song about teaching yourself
how to wipe your ass

11:14.049 --> 11:15.842
-after going to the bathroom.
-(laughter)

11:15.884 --> 11:17.886
He told me he's listening to it
because at work,

11:17.928 --> 11:19.930
they're trying to teach
a computer to sing.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.015
And I believed him at the time,

11:22.057 --> 11:23.683
but now I'm wondering:

11:23.725 --> 11:25.977
does my father not know
how to go to the bathroom?

11:26.019 --> 11:29.981
-(laughter)
-And if that's true,
who taught me?

11:30.023 --> 11:32.442
Because my mother never goes
to the bathroom. Or eats. Or...

11:32.484 --> 11:33.735
Fire!

11:33.777 --> 11:35.612
Fire in the kitchen!
Everybody out!

11:35.654 --> 11:38.323
-To the exits, now! Go, go!
-What? Why?

11:38.365 --> 11:39.449
What-What's going on?

11:39.491 --> 11:40.575
CLUB MANAGER:
There's a fire. Everybody out.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.702
Move to the exits, now! Go!

11:42.744 --> 11:44.913
Okay, folks, I guess
everybody's supposed to leave.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.207
-SUSIE: No! Keep talking!
-Are you not hearing me?

11:47.249 --> 11:49.626
-There's a fire in the kitchen!
-Well, of course there is.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.169
It's how you
fuckin' cook things.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.629
I'm Mrs. Maisel.
Thank you. Good night.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.798
If you catch on fire,
stop, drop and roll.

11:54.840 --> 11:57.050
You have water in that kitchen?
You can put fire out with water.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.427
-You know that, right?
-Susie, please. I've got

11:58.468 --> 11:59.886
a lot of flammable product
in my hair.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.304
We'll die if we just stand here.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.849
-So you die on stage.
What a way to go.
-Move!

12:03.890 --> 12:07.102
-Aw, come on, it hasn't
even hit this room yet.
-It will.

12:10.272 --> 12:11.523
(door unlocking)

12:13.817 --> 12:16.403
-Huh.
-I told you it wasn't
gonna be The Ritz.

12:16.445 --> 12:17.654
It's fine.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.739
Big enough. Clean-ish.

12:21.283 --> 12:22.784
Drawers open.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.369
Lights light.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.746
There's the parking lot,
so we can watch the car.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.373
Hi, car.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.959
It's good.
Guess we share the dresser.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.420
How many drawers
do you think you'll need?

12:33.462 --> 12:35.088
(sighs)

12:37.257 --> 12:38.925
Looks like one.

12:38.967 --> 12:42.095
Then I'll make do
with the other five.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.556
Hey, you put coins in the TV.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.808
Are you not having fun?

12:46.850 --> 12:48.560
I just wanted you
to finish your set.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.061
I know. I was on fire.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.688
And then the place was, too.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.732
-Maybe I set the fire.
-On the bright side,

12:53.773 --> 12:55.400
the guy paid us the whole take.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.235
Plus we got out
before the building collapsed.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.112
So, go ahead and shower.
I know you want to.

12:59.154 --> 13:01.490
I will. As soon as the guy
brings up my bags.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.492
-What guy?
-The guy who checked us in.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.285
You think Vlad the Impaler
in the lobby

13:05.327 --> 13:06.703
is bringing up your bags?

13:06.745 --> 13:08.497
-Yes.
-Based on what?

13:08.538 --> 13:10.540
Based on the fact that I said,
"Just the two, thanks,"

13:10.582 --> 13:12.334
and he nodded like he
was gonna bring them up.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.669
No, he nodded like he was
gonna go through your luggage

13:14.711 --> 13:17.005
and whack off with your girdle
stretched over his face.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.925
-So no one's
bringing up my bags?
-No. It's a motel.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.885
You want 'em, you go get 'em.

13:21.927 --> 13:23.553
Right. Okay.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.307
-Do not look at me.
-Fine. I'm gonna go down

13:27.349 --> 13:29.643
to get the bags
and carry them up myself.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.895
After all, this trip
is about trying new things

13:31.937 --> 13:34.189
and expanding my horizons.

13:34.231 --> 13:35.607
It's bags, not a threesome

13:35.649 --> 13:37.359
with Marilyn Monroe
and Arthur Miller.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.277
No, but it's steep stairs;
no elevator.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.030
Here, take this.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.907
Sure you don't want to come?

13:43.949 --> 13:46.701
Mm. Only you can expand
your horizons, Miriam.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.411
New things!

13:52.082 --> 13:54.251
Fuckin' weirdo.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.631
This is like being back
in college, sharing a room.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.925
-Or a slumber party.
-Or jail.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.094
You ever have slumber parties
when you were a kid?

14:04.135 --> 14:06.304
If you count everyone
falling asleep in the same room

14:06.346 --> 14:08.598
'cause they were too drunk
to get up a slumber party.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.433
We used to play
with a Ouija board

14:10.475 --> 14:11.935
and try to contact Valentino.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.353
One time the lights flickered.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.813
It was scary. But fun.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.773
One time my cousin came
into my room at night

14:16.815 --> 14:19.317
and got on top of me.
I jabbed my finger into his eye,

14:19.359 --> 14:20.777
and he was blind for a week.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.237
It was scary. But fun.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.864
-We could watch TV.
-Meh. This late,

14:24.906 --> 14:26.992
it's just the test pattern
with the Indian chief.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.785
Just shut the lights off,

14:28.827 --> 14:31.288
and we'll both be snoring
like buzz saws any minute.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.831
-Oh.
-What?

14:32.872 --> 14:35.333
-You snore?
-How would I know? I'm sleeping.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.711
Well, has anyone
ever told you you do?

14:37.752 --> 14:39.671
What kind of a sick fuck's
gonna come into my room,

14:39.713 --> 14:41.590
listen to me sleep,
then tell me about it?

14:41.631 --> 14:43.883
So no one you've ever shared
a bed with has let you know?

14:43.925 --> 14:45.885
-Did you ask your cousin?
-Really?

14:45.927 --> 14:47.429
The reason
your husband left you?

14:47.470 --> 14:49.556
You wouldn't let him get
any sleep.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.186
(Midge clears throat)

14:55.228 --> 14:57.856
(takes deep breath)

14:57.897 --> 15:00.483
Hey, remember when that
really old lady was yelling

15:00.525 --> 15:02.652
"Take me, I'm on fire!"
at the fireman?

15:02.694 --> 15:04.738
-Yeah.
-Then the fireman threw
that blanket over her.

15:04.779 --> 15:07.073
For a minute
I thought he was gonna do it.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.867
SUSIE: Give the old bird
her dying wish.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.535
MIDGE (breathily):
"Take me, I'm on fire."

15:10.577 --> 15:12.829
Hmm. You should put that shit
in your set tomorrow.

15:12.871 --> 15:15.123
I'm opening with it.
Did she die?

15:15.165 --> 15:18.126
-Nah.
-Maybe in the act she'll die.

15:18.168 --> 15:20.545
I think I can keep that funny.
Night, Susie.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.047
Mm.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.923
-Hey, Susie.
-What?

15:23.965 --> 15:26.635
She wanted
to slide down his pole.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.303
Go to sleep.

15:29.804 --> 15:32.599
(chuckles):
Pole's funny.

15:32.641 --> 15:34.434
(Midge chuckles)

15:34.476 --> 15:36.102
MIDGE:
He's sleeping okay there?

15:36.144 --> 15:38.563
-JOEL: Like a rock.
He's doing great.
-Let me say hi.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.357
Hey, Ethan. It's Mommy.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.650
Want to say hi?

15:41.691 --> 15:43.276
No. She has to ring it.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.403
-He doesn't want to talk to me?
-Sure he does.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.822
He just wants you to call back
so the phone'll ring

15:47.864 --> 15:49.824
-especially for him.
-Okay.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.452
Guess Mommy's made
of coins. One sec.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.582
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.085
-It's something. What is it?
-Leg hurts.

16:00.126 --> 16:03.046
-What'd you do?
-Why is this my fault?

16:03.088 --> 16:04.964
(phone rings)

16:06.549 --> 16:08.051
Hi, Mommy.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.928
Hi, sweetie. How...

16:09.969 --> 16:11.137
Hello?

16:11.179 --> 16:12.889
Ethan?

16:12.931 --> 16:14.849
(phone rings)

16:15.892 --> 16:17.602
-Hi.
-What happened?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.771
Well, he doesn't really like
talking on the phone.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.231
He just loves answering it.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.732
-He's forgotten me.
-No, he hasn't.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.776
Two days, I've been gone.
Two days.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.653
He's a kid.
I'll tell him you miss him.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.238
And you can call collect, Midge.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.532
That would have been a good idea
about three dollars ago.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.951
Wait, are you short? You got
enough money for the trip?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.911
Sure. I just don't carry
it all around in quarters.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.204
It makes my thighs look lumpy.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.081
-Where are you two?
-Gas station.

16:38.123 --> 16:40.250
How's Susie's car?
Does it run okay?

16:40.291 --> 16:42.627
Purrs like a really old,
angry kitten.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.088
-And she's a decent driver?
-We go places and we get there.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.923
Does she know
how to change a tire?

16:46.965 --> 16:48.133
I'd assume so.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.175
-Ask her.
-Joel.

16:49.217 --> 16:50.427
Where'd you stay in D.C.?

16:50.468 --> 16:51.720
I'm not sure I have enough coins

16:51.761 --> 16:53.138
to get through
all three centuries

16:53.179 --> 16:54.431
-of the Spanish Inquisition.
-You know what?

16:54.472 --> 16:55.682
-Is she there?
-Susie?

16:55.724 --> 16:57.225
Yeah. Put her on.
I can give her

16:57.267 --> 16:58.768
some pointers
on changing a tire.

16:58.810 --> 17:02.230
Okay. Joel wants to know
if you can change a tire.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.523
What?

17:03.565 --> 17:05.024
Ugh.

17:09.738 --> 17:10.989
(singsongy):
Hello.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.532
Yes, I can change a stupid tire.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.159
Now, listen,
and you listen good.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.910
I swear to motherfucking God,
if anything happens

17:15.952 --> 17:18.204
to Midge on this trip,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.915
I don't care that you're
a girl, or short,

17:20.957 --> 17:23.460
I will rip your head off and use
it to play catch with my kid.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.962
She's the mother of my children.
If you fuck this up,

17:26.004 --> 17:28.006
I want you to think of the worst
possible thing that could ever

17:28.047 --> 17:30.300
happen to you, and I want you
to triple it and add a hobbling.

17:30.341 --> 17:32.218
You got it? Now...

17:32.260 --> 17:33.678
apply the wheel wedges,
remove the hubcaps,

17:33.720 --> 17:35.555
loosen the lug nuts,
jack up the car

17:35.597 --> 17:37.307
and change the fucking tire.

17:37.348 --> 17:38.975
Or call a goddamn cab.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.852
Put Midge back on the phone.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.730
Thanks for the tip.

17:43.772 --> 17:47.609
Great guy. Too bad
you kids couldn't work it out.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.236
I should go. We have to get
all the way to Philly.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.071
Where are you staying
when you get there?

17:52.113 --> 17:55.450
-I don't know. Some motel.
-Uh-huh. Put Susie on again.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.702
Too late. She limped off.
Really quickly.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.872
Just be careful, okay?
Will you? Please?

18:00.914 --> 18:02.707
Yes. And kiss
Ethan and Esther for me.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.501
Show them a picture
if you have to.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.710
I will.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.504
-Bye.
-Bye.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.887
Hey, scoot over.
Let's get going.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.223
I got to take a break from
driving; it's killing my leg.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.058
-Meaning...?
-You drive.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.060
-I don't know how to drive.
-What?

18:22.101 --> 18:25.021
-I grew up in the city.
-How the hell
do you plan a road trip

18:25.063 --> 18:26.981
with somebody and forget
to mention that you can't drive?

18:27.023 --> 18:28.775
I did plan to learn
a few years ago.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.568
Oh, well, that's a relief.
For a second there,

18:30.610 --> 18:32.862
I thought maybe you didn't plan
to learn a few years ago.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.239
I even bought
pink driving gloves.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.532
I brought them with me.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.367
Because we were gonna be
in a car.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.953
-You can wear them if you want.
-(sighs): Jesus Christ.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.496
Sorry.

18:43.206 --> 18:45.166
Ass up.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.835
(engine starts)

18:49.879 --> 18:51.422
(metallic clattering)

18:54.884 --> 18:58.137
-Hey! Occupied!
-Aren't I supposed to have
a real dressing room?

18:58.179 --> 18:59.848
Or at least a door with a lock?

18:59.889 --> 19:01.933
Yeah, well, I guess
I got a little busy

19:01.975 --> 19:03.935
making sure the place had,
you know, a stage

19:03.977 --> 19:06.229
-and a place for an audience.
-A manager's supposed to request

19:06.271 --> 19:08.731
things like a dressing room
with a door that locks.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.775
I'm a total idiot.
What do you want me to say?

19:10.817 --> 19:13.027
Usually you show up to a gig
in your show dress.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.196
I forgot you'd need
a place to change. My fault.

19:15.238 --> 19:16.698
-Learning lessons.
-Fine.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.993
-Knock, asshole!
-There's someone
in here, asshole!

19:20.034 --> 19:21.703
-It's me, Dante!
-Booker.

19:21.744 --> 19:22.996
MIDGE/SUSIE:
Sorry!

19:23.037 --> 19:24.581
DANTE:
Your girl is on.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.833
-Uh, we need a minute.
-And a lock for the door.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.585
DANTE: Crowd is restless.
Get a move on.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.587
-Zip me. Hurry.
-How is the crowd?

19:30.628 --> 19:32.297
-DANTE: Good.
-Crowd's good.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.799
-How do I look?
-Like you're ready
to take Philly.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.135
DANTE: Hey, everybody.
Straight from the Big Apple...

19:37.176 --> 19:39.679
-Sorry about the room.
-Sorry I yelled about the room.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.723
-Let's do this.
-Give a big Philly welcome to...

19:41.764 --> 19:43.683
Mrs. Maisel!

19:43.725 --> 19:45.727
(scattered applause)

19:46.978 --> 19:49.647
Well, hello, Philadelphia!

19:49.689 --> 19:51.107
Wow.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.693
You said the crowd was good.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.154
-They are good. There's
just not that many of them.
-MIDGE: I'm Mrs. Maisel.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.489
-Motherfucker.
-MIDGE: So, the...

19:58.531 --> 20:00.533
first joke I was gonna
tell you guys tonight

20:00.575 --> 20:02.911
has one of those
"has anyone here ever" thingies.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.704
But I realize
the odds that anyone here

20:04.746 --> 20:07.957
has ever actually done the thing
I was gonna ask if you had done

20:07.999 --> 20:09.500
are pretty darn low.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.127
Just mathematically.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.087
Unless it was something like:
Has anyone here

20:13.129 --> 20:14.839
-ever gotten alcohol poisoning?
-(laughter)

20:14.881 --> 20:17.091
In which case the odds get
pretty good again.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.510
Because it's Philly.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.346
I think there were
more people in the room

20:21.387 --> 20:23.056
-when my son was born.
-(laughter)

20:23.097 --> 20:24.933
Maybe also
when he was conceived.

20:24.974 --> 20:28.603
Ma'am, the-the tag
is sticking out of your dress.

20:28.645 --> 20:31.606
(dogs barking,
siren wailing in distance)

20:31.648 --> 20:33.608
(door unlocking)

20:33.650 --> 20:36.611
-Jesus.
-Oh, my.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.947
What a shithole.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.990
(indistinct shouting nearby)

20:43.868 --> 20:45.828
(Midge gasps)

20:45.870 --> 20:48.915
What's the matter?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.670
I'm kind of digging
the suspense here.

20:57.674 --> 21:00.635
Well, hello.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.845
(toilet flushes)

21:02.887 --> 21:05.056
Am I a fucking manager or what?

21:05.098 --> 21:08.184
I'll never unsee that.
The sheer size.

21:08.226 --> 21:11.187
Go to bed. Dream of puppies.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.856
Well, hello.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.358
-What now?
-Nothing.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.403
Just a lot of things
to say hello to in this room.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.114
-What?
-Teeth.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.240
-Teeth?
-Teeth.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.366
-False teeth?
-Real teeth.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.368
-Baby teeth?
-Large teeth.

21:25.410 --> 21:28.121
Adult teeth.
Or teeth from a really big baby.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.707
Maybe a... I got nothing.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.250
I don't think
I'll unpack tonight.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.002
Or use the bathroom.
Or lie down.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.129
Or sit down. Or shut my eyes.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.464
-Miriam.
-Hello.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.299
You're on tour.
You got to sleep.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.427
-Just keep your clothes on.
-I don't need sleep.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.345
I can't sleep, anyway,
because of your...

21:44.387 --> 21:46.431
'Cause of my what?

21:49.475 --> 21:52.020
What are you doing?
Don't touch that.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.022
You need to hear something.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.481
I don't want to hear
your D.C. gigs.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.525
It's not my D.C. gigs.
I was going to wait

21:57.567 --> 22:00.486
until we got home, but...

22:00.528 --> 22:02.530
(Susie snoring on tape)

22:05.533 --> 22:07.493
What is that?

22:07.535 --> 22:09.746
-That's you.
-Bullshit.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.748
-Hold on.
-(snoring grows louder)

22:11.789 --> 22:15.251
-Jesus Christ.
-I'm sorry.

22:15.293 --> 22:16.878
I recorded you when you were
sleeping last night.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.212
First of all, don't ever,

22:18.254 --> 22:20.048
ever touch the tape recorder.
Hear me?

22:20.089 --> 22:21.591
-And "B,"
that's the most sadistic...
-(on tape): Tom Collins.

22:21.632 --> 22:24.260
-Wait, what'd I just say there?
-I think it was "Tom Collins."

22:24.302 --> 22:25.887
-Didn't know you liked gin.
-(snoring continues)

22:25.928 --> 22:28.264
Tom Collins was my teddy bear.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.349
-Oh. Sweet.
-Turn it off.

22:30.391 --> 22:34.395
I will. I just think
you should hear one more thing.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.272
(grunting, snorting)

22:36.314 --> 22:38.274
(snoring stops)

22:38.316 --> 22:40.860
Did I die?

22:40.902 --> 22:43.404
-Maybe. You really need
to see a doctor.
-(snoring resumes)

22:43.446 --> 22:45.740
You need to learn some manners,
you know that?

22:45.782 --> 22:49.035
-I was just trying to help.
-Don't help me. Write that down.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.245
Look, I know it's embarrassing,
but when I was little,

22:51.287 --> 22:53.414
my mother used to wake me up
when I made unseemly noises

22:53.456 --> 22:56.542
to train me to be a ladylike
sleeper. For when I got married.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.753
-She recorded you?
-No. She sat
on the edge of my bed

22:58.795 --> 23:00.046
and shook me
when I made a noise.

23:00.088 --> 23:02.006
Wow. Freak doesn't fall far
from the tree.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.342
-One day you might
thank me, Susie.
-Yeah?

23:04.383 --> 23:06.344
Well, you taped over the
D.C. gigs, so thanks for that.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.387
Hope you remember
your American Revolution joke

23:08.429 --> 23:10.014
word-for-word, 'cause it's gone.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.729
You're really gonna stand there
all night?

23:16.771 --> 23:18.898
It works
for Francis the Talking Mule.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.441
Suit yourself.

23:20.483 --> 23:23.486
I'm sleeping in your bed, then.
Mine's taken.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.537
-MIDGE: Good night.
-SUSIE: Fuck you.

23:35.665 --> 23:37.667
Starving.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.293
Bathroom. Fix.

23:39.335 --> 23:42.338
-Counter. Eat.
-Coffee.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.136
Fuck.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.012
Come on.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.931
Don't look.

23:53.975 --> 23:55.768
Mmm.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.603
(sighs)

23:57.645 --> 24:00.898
Hey, you have any idea
what these weird bumps are?

24:00.940 --> 24:03.693
-I mean, is this, like,
a local thing?
-I'm 16.

24:03.734 --> 24:06.404
I didn't ask if you'd ever
been blown. I asked about this.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.370
I give.

24:14.412 --> 24:16.372
You didn't get me any coffee.
Coffee, please.

24:16.414 --> 24:19.083
Yeah, he's not coming back.
Probably on his way to therapy.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.878
I knew it was bad, but when
I looked in a mirror-- God.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.963
Why didn't you tell me
I looked like shit?

24:24.005 --> 24:25.923
I have my own problems, missy.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.592
Oh, my God, your face.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.427
-No kidding, my face.
-What happened?

24:29.468 --> 24:32.221
-What's it look like?
Something bit me.
-It was the bed.

24:32.263 --> 24:34.348
You laid on the bed. Thank God
I didn't lay on the bed.

24:34.390 --> 24:36.184
What have you got in there
that can fix this?

24:36.225 --> 24:37.560
Nothing.

24:37.602 --> 24:39.270
You have 500 things
in that case.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.063
-You got nothing for bites?
-I could do

24:41.105 --> 24:43.024
some mascara for you.
Maybe a little eyeliner.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.443
-How's that gonna help?
-It'll make your eyes
look bigger,

24:45.484 --> 24:47.570
and that'll draw attention away
from the rest of your face.

24:47.612 --> 24:50.615
Hey, I have that all organized.

24:52.617 --> 24:55.036
Yeah, this shit's got "skin"
right there.

24:55.077 --> 24:58.331
That'll make your welts
look ten years younger.

24:58.372 --> 25:01.459
There's more now.
Shit, they're still hatching.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.544
Shit.
This bite has a bite on it.

25:03.586 --> 25:05.254
I'm sorry.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.048
I'm going to the drugstore
to see if there's someone there

25:07.089 --> 25:08.424
who can help me more than you,

25:08.466 --> 25:11.344
like a blind-mute baby
with no arms.

25:13.346 --> 25:14.388
(line ringing)

25:14.430 --> 25:15.765
ABE (over phone):
Hello?

25:15.806 --> 25:17.433

25:17.475 --> 25:19.852
for Abe or Rose Weissman.
Do you accept the charges?

25:19.894 --> 25:21.729
I don't know.
What are my options?

25:21.771 --> 25:24.065
-MIDGE: Take the call.
-I'll take the call.

25:24.106 --> 25:26.317
-OPERATOR: Go ahead, please.
-Hello, Papa.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.860
Skip the niceties.
What do you need?

25:27.902 --> 25:29.153
MIDGE:
I'm just calling to check in.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.488
-How's the baby?
-ABE: She's drooling.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.949
-She's defecating.
-Does she miss me?

25:32.990 --> 25:35.201
I think unless she can fit you
in her mouth,

25:35.243 --> 25:37.328
you are of no consequence
to her at all.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.580
-Anything else?
-You're in a mood.

25:39.622 --> 25:43.000
-Well, your mother
has pulled a fast one.
-What now?

25:43.042 --> 25:46.796
She's throwing some sort
of soiree and forgot to tell me.

25:46.837 --> 25:48.130
Or you forgot to listen.

25:48.172 --> 25:50.716
ABE:
Now there's tables and chairs.

25:50.758 --> 25:53.344
-They've taken over my study.
-Maybe it's her garden club?

25:53.386 --> 25:54.971
It's been ages
since she's hosted them.

25:55.012 --> 25:57.473
There's flowers and tables
and streamers.

25:57.515 --> 25:59.809
Streamers
usually indicate music.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.769
They drink some wine
and talk about stamens.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.896
-It'll be over in an hour.
-She's not even here.

26:03.938 --> 26:06.065
She just left me like this
to fend for myself.

26:06.107 --> 26:08.025
-So where's the baby?
-Glassware?

26:08.067 --> 26:09.527
She got rental glassware.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.738
-Papa.
-The baby's with Rose
at the beauty parlor.

26:12.780 --> 26:15.074
-I just said that.
-You didn't, actually.

26:15.116 --> 26:16.701
Miriam, I have to go.

26:16.742 --> 26:19.328
I just heard the words
"potato salad."

26:19.370 --> 26:22.790
There's only so much
a man can take in his own house.

26:22.832 --> 26:24.834
This stuff does not help at all.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.961
You're supposed to blow on it.

26:27.003 --> 26:29.672
(blowing)

26:29.714 --> 26:31.632
-Are they gone?
-No.

26:31.674 --> 26:33.217
Then get the fuck away from me.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.261
Okay. I have to go change.

Aren't you supposed to keep

26:50.234 --> 26:51.861
Thought you didn't know
how to drive.

26:51.902 --> 26:53.571
I know how not to drive.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.656
-(thunder rumbling)
-Was that thunder?

26:55.698 --> 26:58.409
-I didn't hear anything.
-I definitely heard a rumble,

26:58.451 --> 27:00.995
and I didn't bring my rain mac
because you said not to, Susie.

27:01.037 --> 27:03.205
I didn't tell you not
to bring your rain mac

27:03.247 --> 27:04.832
'cause I don't know
what a rain mac is.

27:04.874 --> 27:07.209
It's a fashionable cover
to keep you dry, and I left it

27:07.251 --> 27:09.086
at home because you said
the weather was gonna be good.

27:09.128 --> 27:12.381
-I repeated what the paper said.
-I would've brought my rain mac,

27:12.423 --> 27:14.175
I would've brought my galoshes,
I would've brought...

27:14.216 --> 27:17.428
-Potato salad.
-What?

27:17.470 --> 27:19.555
Stop the car. Stop the car.

27:19.597 --> 27:20.890
I can't just stop the car.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.600

-WOMEN: Aw.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.940
Oh, yay, more booties.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.735
Thanks, Nancy.

27:32.777 --> 27:34.487
Bring more napkins.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.989
-They're going through
a lot of them.
-Yes, ma'am.

27:37.031 --> 27:39.992
IMOGENE:
Good, a bonnet and booties.

27:40.034 --> 27:42.787
WOMEN:
Aw.

27:42.828 --> 27:45.790
Mr. Bemis works at a bank,
but all he wants is time alone

27:45.831 --> 27:48.793
to read his precious books.
It's his passion.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.920
-I love books.
-Anyway...

27:50.961 --> 27:53.130
Why is no one answering
the phone?

27:53.172 --> 27:56.634
His wife's a shrew, so he can't
read at home. She won't let him.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.637
And he wears these really thick
reading glasses, you see?

27:59.678 --> 28:04.225
Anyway, he finally decides
to hide out in the bank vault.

28:04.266 --> 28:05.601
All right, I'll answer it.

28:05.643 --> 28:06.769
DON:
What's this program called?

28:06.811 --> 28:08.187
ABE:
The Twilight Zone.

28:08.229 --> 28:09.563
-ARCHIE: Never heard of it.
-ABE: It's new.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.357
-Hello?
-MIDGE (distorted): Hello?

28:11.399 --> 28:13.401
ABE: While our man is in the
vault, there's a nuclear war.

28:13.442 --> 28:15.444
-They drop the H-bomb.
-ROSE: Hello?

28:15.486 --> 28:17.405
-Wow.
-(chuckles)
Didn't see that comin'.

28:17.446 --> 28:20.658
-Neither did he.
But there's another twist.
-I love twists.

28:20.699 --> 28:21.992
Miriam, is that you?

28:22.034 --> 28:23.911
-I can barely hear you.
-Miriam's on the phone?

28:23.953 --> 28:25.329
I forgot about the baby shower.

28:25.371 --> 28:28.040
-Did you? I hadn't noticed.
-MIDGE: Oh, God.

28:28.082 --> 28:30.292
I am so sorry. I-I must've
gotten the dates mixed up.

28:30.334 --> 28:31.710
I've been so busy getting ready
for the tour,

28:31.752 --> 28:33.003
and then Papa said
"potato salad."

28:33.045 --> 28:35.464
I'm so sorry. It's today.

28:35.506 --> 28:37.007
-ROSE: Where are you?
-MIDGE: A pay phone

28:37.049 --> 28:38.968
-in Pennsylvania.
-She's not gonna make it?

28:39.009 --> 28:40.928
-ROSE: Apparently not.
-Wait.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.430
Wait, it's still happening
without me?

28:42.471 --> 28:43.973
You're right.
We should reschedule.

28:44.014 --> 28:45.182
I'm sure Imogene
can cross her legs

28:45.224 --> 28:47.017
-and hold it in.
-She's not coming?

28:47.059 --> 28:49.019
-I'm sure there's a good reason.
-ARCHIE: Can you tell Imogene?

28:49.061 --> 28:50.980
I'll wait here behind the table.
And Donny.

28:51.021 --> 28:52.690
-Put Papa on.
-Abe?

28:52.731 --> 28:54.942
Hold on, let me finish this.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.819
So, Mr. Bemis
is the sole survivor

28:56.861 --> 28:58.070
because he was in the vault,

28:58.112 --> 29:00.197
and for the first time,
he's lonely.

29:00.239 --> 29:03.033
Burgess Meredith plays this
with a lot of pathos.

29:03.075 --> 29:06.579
But then he finds the ruins
of the library.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.998
-ROSE: Abe.
-ABE: Mr. Bemis is overjoyed
at the sight

29:09.039 --> 29:11.417
of all the books with all
the time in the world to read.

29:11.459 --> 29:13.627
-But then...
-Does he break his glasses?

29:13.669 --> 29:15.546
And there's no one to fix 'em.

29:15.588 --> 29:17.756
You made a big deal
about his glasses before.

29:17.798 --> 29:20.176
Is that right?
(chuckles) That's great.

29:24.346 --> 29:26.307
-Hello?
-Papa, why didn't you tell me

29:26.348 --> 29:28.767
-they were setting up
for Imogene's shower?
-I did.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.769
You said it was the garden club.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.688
No, you said
it was the garden club.

29:32.730 --> 29:35.357
-Put me on speakerphone, please.
-Why?

29:35.399 --> 29:37.735
Take me to the living room
and put me on speakerphone.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.780
Hello? Am I on?

29:41.822 --> 29:43.699
It's working. Explain yourself.

29:43.741 --> 29:45.367
Hi, everyone.

29:45.409 --> 29:48.412
-ALL: Hi.
-Imogene, can you hear me okay?

29:48.454 --> 29:50.498
-Yes, Midge.
-You sound far away.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.458
I'm not. You are.

29:52.500 --> 29:55.503
Honey, I am so sorry.
I'm here in Pennsylvania,

29:55.544 --> 29:58.714
and I'm stuck,
and I have no excuse.

29:58.756 --> 30:00.424
-And I want everyone to hear it.
-Whoa.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.801
I am a terrible person,
but I want you all to know

30:02.843 --> 30:05.971
-I am sorry,
and I love my friend Imogene.
-(horse neighs)

30:06.013 --> 30:07.681
You're not a terrible person,
Midge.

30:07.723 --> 30:09.517
MIDGE:
I am. I am terrible,

30:09.558 --> 30:10.893
and I just have to live
with that.

30:10.935 --> 30:13.020
-But I hope
you liked the cupcakes.
-IMOGENE: I did.

30:13.062 --> 30:14.939
And the little sugar babies
on top.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.650
-A little creepy eating babies,
but delicious.
-MIDGE: Good.

30:17.691 --> 30:20.069
Oh, your present. Imogene,
you should get your present.

30:20.110 --> 30:21.529
-That's okay.
-No, it's in my bedroom,

30:21.570 --> 30:22.863
but I didn't have a chance
to wrap it yet.

30:22.905 --> 30:24.823
There's a Bendel's bag.
Run and get it.

30:24.865 --> 30:27.660
-She's not supposed to run.
-No, I didn't mean
she should run.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.078
I'll get it when you're back.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.412
Take a picture for me, Archie?

30:30.454 --> 30:31.789
I didn't bring my camera.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.999
MIDGE:
Borrow my father's.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.086
Uh, well, I guess I...

30:37.127 --> 30:38.837
shouldn't hold up the party
any longer.

30:38.879 --> 30:40.631
Everybody go back to having fun.

30:40.673 --> 30:42.132
Bye, Midge.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.802
And, Midge, it's beautiful.

30:44.843 --> 30:48.514
I'm glad. Bye, everyone.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.599
ALL:
Bye.

30:55.563 --> 30:57.523
(thunder rumbling)

31:01.569 --> 31:03.445
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

31:03.487 --> 31:05.447
-There's a storm.
-So what?

31:05.489 --> 31:07.783
She has a gig here tonight.
This is Mrs. Maisel.

31:07.825 --> 31:09.285
-You're the singer?
-No.

31:09.326 --> 31:10.828
-She's the comedian.
-Well, sorry.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.246
No one's showing up
in this weather.

31:12.288 --> 31:14.373
There's a 50% chance
the roof'll cave in.

31:14.415 --> 31:16.959
Call me.
We'll rebook for next week.

31:17.001 --> 31:18.877
Sure, we're in Harrisburg
all the time.

31:18.919 --> 31:21.380
Can't get enough
of that Civil War Museum. Hey!

31:21.422 --> 31:23.632
-Crap.
-Susie.

31:23.674 --> 31:26.010
-What?
-It's raining.

31:26.051 --> 31:28.971
(Susie groans)

31:29.013 --> 31:30.931
How does he know
no one's coming?

31:30.973 --> 31:32.808
He's an idiot.
That's how he knows.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.268
He knows nothing.

31:34.310 --> 31:36.604
Well, then let's stop dealing
with idiots.

31:36.645 --> 31:39.148
Everyone in this
idiotic business is an idiot.

31:39.189 --> 31:40.566
You ever meet someone
in show business

31:40.608 --> 31:42.234
who's not an idiot,
then they're an asshole.

31:42.276 --> 31:44.153
It's a business
of idiots and assholes.

31:44.194 --> 31:47.156
I could've gone to the shower.
Goddamn it.

31:47.197 --> 31:49.408
Let's go.

31:49.450 --> 31:52.870
-(ignition sputtering)
-Oh, come on.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.955
You ever read the Book of Job?

31:54.997 --> 31:58.000
My mom read it to me every year
on my birthday.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.421
-You can put your ass down now.
-Why?

32:02.463 --> 32:04.423
This car isn't going anywhere.

32:04.465 --> 32:06.592
Great.

32:06.634 --> 32:09.345
Well, motel's probably foul,
anyway.

32:09.386 --> 32:11.513
This was a big screwup, Susie.

32:11.555 --> 32:14.933
Hey, I didn't force that guy
to close his club.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.894
I didn't break the wiper,

32:16.935 --> 32:19.021
and I definitely
didn't make it rain.

32:19.063 --> 32:20.773
So what now?

32:20.814 --> 32:23.442
Walk to the motel?

32:23.484 --> 32:25.486
Sure.

32:26.987 --> 32:30.032
Although we are out of money.

look forward to.

not Miss America.

Oh, so now I look like shit?

What, are we married
all of a sudden?

33:20.708 --> 33:23.544

33:55.492 --> 33:56.952
-We're talent!
-The what?

33:56.994 --> 33:58.412
I'm-I'm one of
the comedians tonight.

33:58.454 --> 33:59.705
Mrs. Maisel?

33:59.747 --> 34:01.206
We got caught in
this horrible traffic,

34:01.248 --> 34:02.624
almost ran out of gas
in the Holland Tunnel.

34:02.666 --> 34:03.917
Is there a place where I can...

34:03.959 --> 34:05.544
-Stop talking. Move.
-Hey.

34:05.586 --> 34:06.837
Susie Myerson. Mrs. Maisel.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.088
You're late!

34:08.130 --> 34:10.007
We got stuck in
the Holland Tunnel.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.759
-Hey.
-Maisel. Talent.

34:11.800 --> 34:12.926
-Drink.
-I need a mirror.

34:12.968 --> 34:14.136
You look great.

34:14.178 --> 34:16.180
-I should change.
-No time.

34:16.221 --> 34:17.639
-Get right to the good stuff.
-Mm-hmm.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.266
Hit 'em hard and fast.

34:19.308 --> 34:20.851
Good? (grunts)

34:20.893 --> 34:22.895
Tits up.

34:22.936 --> 34:25.272
Hey there,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:25.314 --> 34:28.484
What the fuck am I doing? Go.

34:28.525 --> 34:31.153
Just fucking clap.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.033
Magda Goebbels,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.910
Poisoned her dogs
and all six of her children

34:37.951 --> 34:40.370
in honor of the Fuhrer,
but now hiding in Manhattan

34:40.412 --> 34:42.581
and giving stand-up comedy
management a go.

34:42.623 --> 34:44.082
Thank you, Magda.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.795
So, how ya doing?

34:47.836 --> 34:49.880
How am I doing?
How do I look like I'm doing?

34:49.922 --> 34:52.841
I'm fucking exhausted. And sore.

34:52.883 --> 34:55.552
And late-- I don't mean
"my time of the month."

34:55.594 --> 34:58.263
Although I'd prefer
an unplanned pregnancy

34:58.305 --> 35:00.724
-to the day I just had.
-(laughter)

35:00.766 --> 35:03.060
We almost ran out of gas
in the Holland Tunnel.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.521
That would've been fun.
As if people coming from Jersey

35:05.562 --> 35:07.314
need something else
to be angry about.

35:07.356 --> 35:10.067
So I can't tell you how good
it is to be back...

35:10.108 --> 35:11.860
-(Susie snoring on tape)
-Shit.

35:11.902 --> 35:13.487
Shit!

35:13.529 --> 35:14.571
(snoring continues)

35:14.613 --> 35:16.365
Shit.

35:16.406 --> 35:19.827
-Professional comedy.
-(laughter)

35:19.868 --> 35:23.163
I'm really glad to be back in
New York City, my home.

35:23.205 --> 35:26.416
Where I have so many friends...
who hate me.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.711
So much family...
who are disappointed in me.

35:29.753 --> 35:34.049
Where my children live...
until they abandon me.

35:34.091 --> 35:35.467
That's why New York
is so great, though.

35:35.509 --> 35:36.927
Everyone you care about
can despise you

35:36.969 --> 35:38.428
and you can still
find a bagel so good,

35:38.470 --> 35:40.180
nothing else matters.

35:40.222 --> 35:41.598
Who needs love
when you've got lox?

35:41.640 --> 35:43.392
They both stink but only one
tastes good.

35:43.433 --> 35:45.644
(laughter)

35:45.686 --> 35:48.105
Ladies and gentlemen,
fellow assholes,

35:48.146 --> 35:50.315
you've been awfully nice
to come home to.

35:50.357 --> 35:51.817
I'm Mrs. Maisel.

35:51.859 --> 35:54.403
Thank you and good night.

35:54.444 --> 35:56.446
(cheering and applause)

36:00.868 --> 36:02.327
Hey, what were those weird
animal noises

36:02.369 --> 36:04.037
on the tape recorder?

36:04.079 --> 36:05.622
Can we just settle up?
It's been a rough fucking week.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.165
Yeah, we all had a rough week.

36:07.207 --> 36:08.792
Thanks for auditioning;
I'll pay ya next time.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.669
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
This wasn't an audition.

36:10.711 --> 36:12.629
Are we ready to go?
Please say we're ready to go.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.464
-He's not paying us.
-What?

36:14.506 --> 36:16.216
Prick Rick. He's not paying us.

36:16.258 --> 36:17.509
He has to pay us.
We have a contract.

36:17.551 --> 36:18.886
We don't have a contract.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.679
Why don't we have a contract?

36:20.721 --> 36:22.931
Because you're doing comedy,
not rezoning the building.

36:22.973 --> 36:24.266
He owes us money.

36:24.308 --> 36:26.018
And I really,
really need to shower.

36:26.059 --> 36:27.853
-Yeah. No shit.
-Fuck you.

36:27.895 --> 36:29.771
Wait here.

36:32.024 --> 36:34.526
Hey, tough guy, you pay the guys
and you don't pay the girls?

36:34.568 --> 36:36.153
Listen, you were late,
and no one was drinking.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.821
How do you think
we make our money?

36:37.863 --> 36:40.115
-Everybody was drinking.
-And it wasn't a bar deal.

36:40.157 --> 36:41.450
Next time. Go home.

36:41.491 --> 36:43.118
-Clean up.
-Hey.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.661
-Stay here.
-Susie, wait.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.288
We are not leaving
without our money.

36:46.330 --> 36:48.582
Stay here and watch
the tape recorder.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.419
Shit.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.011
-Susie?
-SUSIE (muffled): Hey.
-(doorknob rattling)

37:01.053 --> 37:02.304
Susie, where are you?

37:02.346 --> 37:05.307
-I'm in the janitor's closet.
-Did you get the money?

37:05.349 --> 37:07.559
Oh, yeah, I'm in here
counting it right now.

37:07.601 --> 37:10.479
-Really?
-No. What's wrong with you?

37:10.520 --> 37:12.314
I'm tired,
that's what's wrong with me.

37:12.356 --> 37:13.565
How did you get in there?

37:13.607 --> 37:15.025
That psycho shoved me in.

37:15.067 --> 37:17.152
Unlock the door.

37:17.194 --> 37:19.738
I-I think you need a key.

37:19.780 --> 37:21.323
I'm gonna kick his nuts so hard

37:21.365 --> 37:22.866
they're gonna be popping out
of his nose.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.202
-I'm calling the police.
-What are you, an idiot?

37:25.243 --> 37:26.912
You don't call cops
to come to a nightclub.

37:26.954 --> 37:29.081
Just give me a minute to think.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.168
That wasn't a minute.

37:35.337 --> 37:37.422
Ow! Fuck!

37:37.464 --> 37:41.009
I did the gig.
We were late, but I killed.

37:41.051 --> 37:42.844
And the asshole
just won't pay us.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.513
Because he's an asshole.

37:44.554 --> 37:47.349
And I kicked a door
and I can't leave without Susie.

37:47.391 --> 37:48.767
So I'm stuck.

37:48.809 --> 37:51.311
And I stink,
and I scuffed my shoe,

37:51.353 --> 37:54.690
and I broke my toe
and I want my goddamn money.

37:54.731 --> 37:56.483
-What's this asshole's name?
-Susie.

37:56.525 --> 37:58.735
I know Susie;
I meant the other asshole.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.779
-Ricky.
-Ricky!

38:00.821 --> 38:02.239
Hey, Ricky!

38:02.280 --> 38:04.366
-MIDGE: That's him.
-What's this?

38:04.408 --> 38:06.451
-You locked her manager
in a closet?
-What?

38:06.493 --> 38:08.120
No. It was a joke.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.080
Lighten up. We're in
the comedy business, man.

38:10.122 --> 38:11.665
-Let her out.
-Sheesh.

38:11.707 --> 38:13.709
No sense of humor.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.219
-JOEL: Are you all right?
-Yeah.

38:24.261 --> 38:26.513
-Did he do that?
-What? This?

38:26.555 --> 38:29.099
-Oh, no. The bed ate me. See...
-I don't want to know.

38:29.141 --> 38:30.392
Now pay them.

38:30.434 --> 38:32.144
-She was late.
-Ten minutes.

38:32.185 --> 38:33.687
Doesn't matter.
Pay her what you owe her.

38:33.729 --> 38:35.814
So you're her manager.

38:35.856 --> 38:37.190
I'm her manager, Ricky.
You know that.

38:37.232 --> 38:38.900
-So who are you?
-JOEL: What's it matter?

38:38.942 --> 38:40.318
I like to know who
I'm talking to.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.361
-JOEL: I'm her husband.
-Her husband?

38:41.403 --> 38:43.363
Well, why the fuck
don't you keep her...

38:43.405 --> 38:44.614
MIDGE:
Joel.

38:44.656 --> 38:45.866
Wherever that sentence
was going,

38:45.907 --> 38:47.075
it was gonna end up
like that anyway.

38:47.117 --> 38:48.493
A whole new light, pal.

38:48.535 --> 38:49.619
Now pay her what you owe her.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.288
Fine.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.540
You're lucky I don't sue you.

38:55.459 --> 38:57.878
MAN:
Hey, your nose is bleeding.

38:57.919 --> 38:59.379
I miss something here?

38:59.421 --> 39:00.756
-You the owner?
-Yeah.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.466
You let guys like that
run your business?

39:02.507 --> 39:04.926
-He's my sister's kid.
-Family's nice.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.511
Doesn't mean he can run
your business.

39:06.553 --> 39:09.181
Get some people working for you
who respect the talent.

39:09.222 --> 39:11.308
That's talent.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.560
She could put this shithole
on the map someday.

39:13.602 --> 39:15.395
Wake the fuck up.

39:18.482 --> 39:21.568
Yeah, and you also have to buy
your janitor a new plunger.

39:21.610 --> 39:25.238
The one in there is old and sad
and lost its suction.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.199
Sure.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.076
-Is it all there?
-Yup.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.953
Nice doing business with you.

39:31.995 --> 39:34.664
MIDGE: You got to teach me
how to do that one day.

39:42.798 --> 39:44.925
I'm gonna grab a cab home.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.593
You want me to drop you?

39:46.635 --> 39:49.096
No. I started this road trip
with Susie

39:49.137 --> 39:50.722
and I kind of want
to finish it with her.

39:50.764 --> 39:52.808
Thank you, Joel.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.559
Anytime.

40:00.649 --> 40:02.484
You didn't have to call him.

40:02.526 --> 40:06.404
Unfortunately, sometimes to make
things work in a man's world,

40:06.446 --> 40:08.365
you need a man.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.908
That's just the way it is,
Susie.

40:09.950 --> 40:11.743
I would have found a way
to take care of it.

40:11.785 --> 40:14.037
You may be some kind of damsel
in distress, but I'm not.

40:14.079 --> 40:17.082
No, you were a damsel
in di-closet.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.419
Someday.

40:21.461 --> 40:24.089
Yeah. Someday.

40:24.131 --> 40:25.674
Your commission.

40:25.715 --> 40:27.551
Thanks.

40:30.595 --> 40:31.763
You're counting it? Really?

40:31.805 --> 40:33.640
Force of habit.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.907
What the...?

40:55.787 --> 40:57.789
(footsteps approaching)

41:00.542 --> 41:02.085
How was Pennsylvania?

41:02.127 --> 41:04.462
-Mama, what happened?
-What happened?

41:04.504 --> 41:05.714
There was a baby shower.

41:05.755 --> 41:07.424
Did you forget again?

41:07.465 --> 41:09.426
Should we have you checked out
by a doctor?

41:09.467 --> 41:12.012
But it was yesterday.

41:12.053 --> 41:14.973
-I mean, where's Zelda?
-Zelda?

41:15.015 --> 41:17.976
Oh, no. It's your mess.

41:18.018 --> 41:19.895
Good night.
