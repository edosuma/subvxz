00:08.182 --> 00:10.227
Previously onWhy Women Kill...

00:10.271 --> 00:12.099
You can cheat on your wife
all you want,

00:12.142 --> 00:13.752
but you're not
touching mine.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.406
I am in love with you.

00:15.450 --> 00:17.147
ROB:
You knew the rules.
I will never...

00:17.191 --> 00:18.496
leave my wife.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.063
So I can tell Rob is still mad

00:20.107 --> 00:21.064
about the other night.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.500
He hasn't called in days.

00:22.544 --> 00:25.677
Why would he even be with me
if he was so happy with her?

00:25.721 --> 00:27.288
BETH ANN:
Maybe she did something
to hurt him

00:27.331 --> 00:29.464
and he needs time
to forgive her.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.248
This project
I've been involved with,

00:31.292 --> 00:33.250
it's almost over.
I'll be home in time for dinner.

00:33.294 --> 00:34.164
Every night.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.297
SIMONE:
It's Hector.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.081
He was the best hairdresser
I ever had.

00:38.125 --> 00:41.084
I've known for some time
about Karl's indiscretions.

00:41.128 --> 00:45.349
I saw his car parked
at some seedy motel.

00:46.959 --> 00:49.179
What in God's name?

00:49.223 --> 00:50.572
We haven't seen each
other in years.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.574
Hector was the only person

00:52.617 --> 00:54.532
who ever saw me
for the man I truly am.

00:54.576 --> 00:57.840
Stop romanticizing
your grubby little fling.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.189
Do you love him?

00:59.233 --> 01:00.625
I do.

01:00.669 --> 01:01.757
Hey.
Hmm?

01:01.800 --> 01:02.932
You fell asleep.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.368
Take this.
Uh...

01:04.412 --> 01:05.456
I don't think I should.

01:06.588 --> 01:07.850
TAYLOR:
While I was away,

01:07.893 --> 01:09.025
did you two fuck?

01:09.069 --> 01:12.028
We absolutely fucked.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.160
TAYLOR:
Okay.

01:13.203 --> 01:14.465
This was bound to happen, right?

01:14.509 --> 01:16.815
Since we're
all together now.

01:16.859 --> 01:18.469
All right, let's talk
about my script.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.863
I'm expecting offers in
the high six-figure range.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.258
Be good to Jade.
She's your muse.

01:24.301 --> 01:26.608
His muse?
I am the one who spent

01:26.651 --> 01:30.525
the last two years cleaning up
the mess he made of our lives.

01:30.568 --> 01:32.353
What did he do?What didn't he do?

01:32.396 --> 01:33.876
Speed, cocaine.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.921
He's an addict.

01:35.965 --> 01:38.098
One of the producers
wants a rewrite.

01:38.141 --> 01:40.709
And if I can get it to them
on time, then... I'm back.

01:40.752 --> 01:43.190
And the money that will follow,
Jade, I can take care of you.

for that, ma'am?

04:28.398 --> 04:29.704
Bethany.Oh.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.140
Thank you
for meeting me.

04:31.183 --> 04:33.316
Yeah. I was... I was
a little surprised

04:33.360 --> 04:34.448
to get your text.

04:34.491 --> 04:36.232
It's, um, it's
been a minute.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.016
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry about that.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.236
I know I kind of
disappeared there.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.673
Yeah. Thought maybe you had,
uh, found someone else.

04:42.717 --> 04:45.067
No, no, nothing like that.
I just, you know...

04:45.110 --> 04:47.069
Took a different path
for a while.

04:47.112 --> 04:48.331
Yeah. Yeah.Yeah.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.637
All right, Tanya,

04:49.680 --> 04:51.203
listen to me.

04:51.247 --> 04:53.467
You're gonna go play
with your friends while Mommy

04:53.510 --> 04:54.685
talks to her friend, okay?

04:54.729 --> 04:55.947
Okay.Oh, big girl.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.253
I see them on
the playground.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.733
You better go.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.430
Oh, my God.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.171
She's so big.

05:02.214 --> 05:04.042
I know.
In my head,
I still think of her

05:04.086 --> 05:05.609
as a baby.Yeah, well,

05:05.653 --> 05:07.568
24 months is like a
lifetime in kid-years.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.352
Yeah.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.751
Okay, so I got this
shit from Mexico.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.405
It's stepped on a little
bit, but it's good.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.102
Just, like,
15% baby laxatives.

05:20.145 --> 05:22.322
It'll definitely
get you high.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.498
But this shit

05:24.541 --> 05:27.414
just fell off the back of a
fucking boat from Colombia.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.285
Okay, all I did was
chop it up and bag it,

05:29.329 --> 05:30.765
and I swear to God, Eli,

05:30.808 --> 05:34.072
the second you open it,
your entire face goes numb.

05:34.116 --> 05:35.422
Okay, how much?

05:35.465 --> 05:37.467
Give you an eight
ball for 300?

05:37.511 --> 05:39.208
Or I can do two for five.

05:39.251 --> 05:40.688
That's the best
I can do, though.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.603
I'm trying to save for
Tanya's college fund.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.344
Well, you're a good mom.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.867
Mm.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.129
All right, I'll take two.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.783
Okay.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.354
Nice to have you back.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.364
SIMONE:
Karl.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.019
We need to talk.

06:10.848 --> 06:14.765
Bloody hell,
it's 7:00 in the morning.

06:14.809 --> 06:17.986
I was so angry
with you last night.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.553
The way you spoke to me.

06:19.596 --> 06:20.728
Look, Simone...

06:20.771 --> 06:23.078
I was up all night
thinking to myself,

06:23.121 --> 06:26.429
"I wish I'd never
married that man.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.649
He's stolen the last
ten years of my life."

06:28.692 --> 06:30.215
All right, I'm sorry.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.653
Here, put that on.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.350
Why?

06:34.394 --> 06:35.743
Just do it.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.614
All right.

06:39.224 --> 06:42.445
Then I started thinking
about our time together.

06:42.489 --> 06:45.579
You taught me how to ski...

06:46.884 --> 06:49.321
...how to tango.

06:49.365 --> 06:51.541
Hmm. How to speak French.

06:51.585 --> 06:55.589
Asking for more chardonnay
is not really speaking French.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.852
Most importantly,

06:57.895 --> 07:00.550
you taught me how
to laugh at myself.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.773
The truth is, you haven't
stolen anything from me.

07:05.816 --> 07:08.123
If anything,

07:08.166 --> 07:09.907
you've given me more
than I deserved.

07:09.951 --> 07:14.172
I'm sorry, the suspense is
slightly killing me now.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.913
Where is this going?

07:16.958 --> 07:18.438
Follow me.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.746
Just to be clear, I still think
we should get a divorce.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.705
Uh, yes, I assumed as much.

07:24.748 --> 07:27.142
But just because I can't
have you as a husband

07:27.185 --> 07:29.057
doesn't mean I can't
have you as a friend.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.451
And I do like to
keep my friends happy.

07:34.932 --> 07:36.891
Hector.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.675
Hello, Karl.

07:41.635 --> 07:46.248
I have never loved you more
than I do in this moment.

07:46.291 --> 07:49.294
Please, Karl, not in front
of the boyfriend.

08:02.046 --> 08:03.395
Hello.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.702
Sheila.

08:05.746 --> 08:08.357
Your apartment manager told me
you were down here.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.185
I was hoping we could get lunch.Ugh.

08:10.228 --> 08:11.795
Sorry, I just got
called into work.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.536
Two waitresses are sick.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.146
I have to clean my uniform
and get over to Glendale.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.453
It's fine.
We can catch up another time.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.194
Well, there's certainly
a lot to catch up on.

08:19.237 --> 08:21.675
Has something happened?

08:24.373 --> 08:25.417
Mrs. Persky...

08:27.681 --> 08:28.856
I need you to leave.

08:28.899 --> 08:29.987
Why?

08:30.031 --> 08:31.380
I need to talk
to my friend.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.642
What about?

08:32.686 --> 08:33.861
It's private.

08:33.904 --> 08:36.907
So sex, huh?

08:36.951 --> 08:38.909
Just go!

08:44.175 --> 08:46.177
You seem irritable.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.442
Rob dumped me.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.662
He did?

08:52.706 --> 08:54.664
Yeah, he sent roses
with a note

08:54.708 --> 08:58.189
saying, "I can't keep seeing
you, please forgive me."

08:58.233 --> 09:01.932
Oh, well, you knew
this day was coming.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.586
Yeah. I just thought
he would be man enough

09:03.630 --> 09:05.545
to tell me to my face.

09:05.588 --> 09:08.896
You know, I phoned him at his
work yesterday ten times.

09:08.939 --> 09:11.333
His secretary, Claire,
won't put me through.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.900
Well, honey,
it is time to move on.

09:12.943 --> 09:14.815
You don't want to
embarrass yourself.
Well--

09:14.858 --> 09:16.599
Yeah.

09:19.689 --> 09:22.083
What are you doing back here?

09:22.126 --> 09:23.475
I brought my husband.

09:23.519 --> 09:25.086
I want him to see
how you talk to me.

09:25.129 --> 09:27.349
I should go.
I'll call you later.

09:27.392 --> 09:28.916
Thanks.Sorry...

09:28.959 --> 09:32.180
Aw, why the long face?

09:32.223 --> 09:33.616
Did your fella dump you?

09:35.226 --> 09:37.620
Your wife is a horrible person.
Do you know that?

09:37.664 --> 09:40.188
Yeah, I'm aware.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.410
I thought we were excited
about the offer.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.544
No, no.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.025
Look, of-of course I trust you.

09:51.068 --> 09:53.114
Yeah. I mean,
do your thing. Okay.

09:53.157 --> 09:54.376
All right, bye.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.552
Oh, shit.

09:59.207 --> 10:00.295
Is everything all right?

10:00.338 --> 10:04.168
Hey. Uh, yes.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.475
Yeah, there's-there's an offer
on the table for the script.

10:06.518 --> 10:09.086
But Lamar wants to hold out
for more money,

10:09.130 --> 10:10.740
which, you know,
makes me kind of nervous.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.788
What are you on right now?

10:16.920 --> 10:18.182
What? Nothing.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.141
Oh, yeah? Then
what's this, then?

10:20.184 --> 10:22.099
Hmm?

10:22.143 --> 10:24.798
It-it...
it's a heavy pollen year.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.451
Dude...

10:26.495 --> 10:27.801
It's been on the news.

10:27.844 --> 10:29.367
We are on the same team.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.892
I cannot cover for you if you're
gonna be stupid about it.

10:33.763 --> 10:36.766
All right, I'm sorry.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.550
The addy wasn't cutting it
for me anymore,

10:38.594 --> 10:40.030
so I just-- I needed something
a little bit stronger.

10:40.074 --> 10:42.946
Why? The script is done.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.556
TAYLOR:
Guys?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.210
Yeah, we're in here.

10:46.254 --> 10:47.734
: Get your hand
out of your face.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.213
All right.
Sorry.

10:49.257 --> 10:50.519
Hey.Hi.

10:50.562 --> 10:51.868
I need to talk to you both.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.957
Yeah, what's on your mind?Look,

10:54.001 --> 10:56.960
I know I said I was okay with
what went on with you two,

10:57.004 --> 10:58.788
but clearly, I wasn't.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.138
I felt like I went away
for the night, and you two

11:01.182 --> 11:03.793
had suddenly become
this little team without me.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.013
And it's not fair
to blame you,

11:06.056 --> 11:07.667
because I'm the reason
we're all together

11:07.710 --> 11:08.798
in the first place.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.234
I just feel like
I talked you into this

11:10.278 --> 11:12.715
with absolutely no idea of
how we would make it work.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.674
Well, that's okay.

11:14.717 --> 11:17.502
Yeah. I mean,
we will figure it out.We will.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.287
But we're gonna need some help,
and I think I found

11:19.330 --> 11:20.505
just the place to start.

11:23.813 --> 11:26.773
JADE:
"Amour the Merrier Events,
Limited"?

11:26.816 --> 11:27.991
ELI:
Events?

11:28.035 --> 11:29.601
You want us to
go to an orgy?

11:29.645 --> 11:30.907
Oh, it's not an orgy.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.517
It's a polyamory retreat.

11:32.561 --> 11:34.955
Isn't that just a fancy
way of saying "orgy"?

11:34.998 --> 11:36.086
Stop saying orgy.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.740
All right.This is a three-day event

11:37.784 --> 11:39.611
at a hotel in San Diego.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.962
They have workshops,
lectures, all designed

11:42.005 --> 11:44.051
to help people who are new
to the polyamorous lifestyle.

11:44.094 --> 11:45.400
The whole thing is designed

11:45.443 --> 11:47.228
by experts who know how to
make a relationship

11:47.271 --> 11:49.230
like ours work.

11:49.273 --> 11:50.753
Oh, look, so here's
one of the seminars.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.537
"Negotiating Boundaries
and Polyamorous

11:52.581 --> 11:54.844
Relationship Agreements."

11:54.888 --> 11:57.586
Doesn't that sound helpful?Yeah, it really does.

11:57.629 --> 11:58.892
Um, let me-- let me see.See?

11:58.935 --> 12:00.371
So, I'll go make
the reservations.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.765
We'll leave tomorrow.All right.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.767
Yeah, wonderful.
Yeah.
Yep.

12:06.073 --> 12:08.118
You okay, babe?

12:08.162 --> 12:11.252
Yeah, yeah, just,
you know, allergies. Oof.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.167
It is a heavy pollen year.

12:14.603 --> 12:16.910
It was on the news.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.650
Huh.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.182
Here comes the bubbly.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.184
Pour like there's
no tomorrow.

12:30.227 --> 12:33.100
You are getting
your husband back.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.841
I'm so happy.

12:34.884 --> 12:36.538
Of course,
I feel bad for April.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.888
Why? She should've known
what was coming.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.237
This is how the movie

12:40.281 --> 12:42.544
always ends: the man
slinks back to his wife,

12:42.587 --> 12:45.025
and the whore ends up drunk
and alone.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.114
Actually,
now that I got four kids,

12:47.157 --> 12:48.768
it doesn't sound so bad.

12:50.378 --> 12:52.815
I was thinking of taking April
to a restaurant next week.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.817
You know, to cheer her up.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.645
Beth Ann, the war is over.

12:56.688 --> 13:00.170
You won. Let the enemy
limp away in defeat.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.607
April and I grew very close
these last few weeks.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.218
It's a true friendship.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.133
She thinks your name is Sheila.

13:06.176 --> 13:09.179
I admit, it's a complicated...

13:12.443 --> 13:14.315
Honey! What's wrong?

13:14.358 --> 13:15.795
April is in my driveway.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.365
Shit.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.454
What is she doing here?

13:23.498 --> 13:25.021
Why the fuck
should I know?

13:25.065 --> 13:26.240
We can't open the door.

13:26.283 --> 13:27.502
I think we're
gonna have to.

13:27.545 --> 13:28.764
I think she saw me.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.462
You have to be me.

13:31.506 --> 13:32.855
Are you crazy?

13:32.899 --> 13:34.509
Please. I'm begging.

13:34.552 --> 13:36.206
Fine.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.425
Christ on a cracker.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.600
Don't swear.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.776
And be nice.

13:44.345 --> 13:46.390
May I help you?

13:46.434 --> 13:49.306
Are you Mrs. Robert Stanton?

13:49.350 --> 13:50.394
Yes.

13:50.438 --> 13:52.527
And who might you be,
pray tell?

13:52.570 --> 13:54.181
I'm April.

13:54.224 --> 13:57.532
I'm... a-a waitress at
Jansen's Diner in Glendale.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.708
Your husband is one
of my regulars.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.231
Is he?

14:01.275 --> 14:02.885
Yes.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.669
Um...

14:04.713 --> 14:06.671
I don't mean to rush you, dear,

14:06.715 --> 14:10.371
but I have curtains to hem
and croutons in the oven.

14:10.414 --> 14:12.590
APRIL:
Yes, I just wanted

14:12.634 --> 14:15.158
to come by to say that I think
your husband might have left

14:15.202 --> 14:16.899
his coat at the diner.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.510
Well, mercy me.

14:19.554 --> 14:22.426
APRIL:
I-I'm not even sure

14:22.470 --> 14:24.080
if it's his, but...

14:24.124 --> 14:26.256
if you wouldn't mind just
telling him that I stopped by

14:26.300 --> 14:27.823
and asking him to call me.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.825
He knows your number...

14:29.869 --> 14:31.392
number?

14:31.435 --> 14:33.568
At the diner.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.657
He could just give me
a call at the diner.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.267
I'll tell him.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.834
Bye now.Goodbye.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.098
I have never said "mercy me."

14:42.142 --> 14:43.839
But you do bake
your own croutons.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.320
I can't believe April
actually came to the house.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.409
Got to say,
I'm impressed.

14:48.452 --> 14:50.672
That tramp, she ain't going down
without a fight.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.979
Well, this tramp isn't either.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.634
You know what I mean.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.290
I have to leave in ten minutes,
and I have got

15:00.334 --> 15:02.336
absolutely no idea
what to wear.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.164
You're so cute,
all aflutter

15:04.207 --> 15:06.079
over your dinner
with your new beau.

15:06.122 --> 15:08.037
Is this pastel too gay?

15:08.081 --> 15:09.821
Have you ever seen
a straight pastel?

15:09.865 --> 15:12.868
Will you please put
the paper down and help me?

15:12.912 --> 15:15.044
I'm trying to find a nice
place for you to live.

15:15.088 --> 15:18.221
Oh, what about a condo
at Sanford Palms?

15:18.265 --> 15:19.744
Sanford Palms?

15:19.788 --> 15:22.704
That's only about five blocks
away from here.

15:22.747 --> 15:23.966
Well, I still want us
to have our movie nights.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.011
You wouldn't have to drive home

15:25.054 --> 15:26.447
after cocktails.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.884
Our friends are going
to despise us.

15:28.928 --> 15:29.885
Why?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.147
When people split up,

15:31.191 --> 15:34.150
they prefer venom
and fireworks,

15:34.194 --> 15:35.760
tears and accusations.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.501
So childish
and petty.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.547
Besides, we did that last week.Right.

15:39.590 --> 15:40.983
I've narrowed it down
to these two.

15:41.027 --> 15:41.984
Which do you prefer?

15:42.028 --> 15:43.246
The linen.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.247
Are you sure?

15:44.291 --> 15:45.988
Why do you care
which suit?

15:46.032 --> 15:47.207
How long is it gonna be on,
really?

15:47.250 --> 15:50.558
Oi! I'm a good girl, I am.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.255
I don't let
no gentleman touch me

15:52.299 --> 15:54.431
what ain't
bought me lobster first.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.433
Oh, that's Tommy.

15:56.477 --> 15:57.782
Don't do Eliza for him.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.088
He won't understand
the reference,

15:59.132 --> 16:00.785
and he'll think
you're having a stroke.

16:00.829 --> 16:03.266
Yes. Much humor is lost
on the younger generation.

16:03.310 --> 16:04.354
Trousers!

16:06.878 --> 16:09.316
Tommy. Come in.

16:09.359 --> 16:10.665
Where's Mr. Grove?

16:10.708 --> 16:12.580
He has a date
tonight.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.277
With a guy?

16:14.321 --> 16:15.713
Yes.

16:15.757 --> 16:18.412
I've lost a husband, but
I've gained a gay sidekick.

16:18.455 --> 16:19.413
I'm glad.

16:19.456 --> 16:20.762
Because now...

16:20.805 --> 16:22.938
we don't have to hide
when we do this.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.462
Mmm.

16:25.506 --> 16:28.465
I'm feeling
something interesting.

16:28.509 --> 16:29.901
Can you blame me?

16:29.945 --> 16:33.035
Not down there-- up here.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.125
Oh! Is this for me?

16:36.169 --> 16:38.345
I was saving that
for after dinner.

16:38.388 --> 16:39.607
Do you think you can wait?

16:39.650 --> 16:42.044
What a question.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.046
Of course not.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.832
It's stunning.

16:47.876 --> 16:50.313
Your taste is improving.

16:50.357 --> 16:51.749
Mm.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.577
A woman like you
deserves the best.

16:53.621 --> 16:56.928
And I-I want you to see
that I can give that to you.

16:56.972 --> 16:59.105
KARL:
Tommy!

17:00.584 --> 17:01.977
He hasn't left yet?

17:02.021 --> 17:04.153
Thank God
I caught you.

17:04.197 --> 17:05.241
I need fresh eyes
on an outfit.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.417
Uh, Simone
prefers the linen,

17:07.461 --> 17:09.419
but I think the navy's
more slimming.

17:09.463 --> 17:10.638
Thoughts?

17:10.681 --> 17:12.553
Y-You're not fat.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.729
Yes. As a straight man,
I am boyishly slim.

17:14.772 --> 17:17.471
However, as a homo, I could
afford to lose a few. So...

17:17.514 --> 17:19.299
See what Tommy
gave me.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.387
Ooh.

17:20.430 --> 17:21.823
Hark at you.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.520
Diamond Jim Brady Bunch.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.305
Anyway,

17:25.348 --> 17:26.436
which one?

17:26.480 --> 17:27.655
Just pick one.

17:27.698 --> 17:28.917
Navy.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.353
Navy it is.
Thank you.

17:30.397 --> 17:33.443
I'm terribly sorry
to interrupt,

17:33.487 --> 17:34.966
but, as you know,

17:35.010 --> 17:37.360
it's very important
to get the costume right

17:37.404 --> 17:39.145
when you're coming out.

17:39.188 --> 17:42.844
We don't care if you come out,
just as long as you get out.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.237
I can always take a subtle hint,
Simone.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.239
Perhaps, one day,
you'll give me one.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.197
Oh, tell Hector you
won't sleep with him

17:48.241 --> 17:50.199
unless he does my hair
for the wedding!

17:50.243 --> 17:51.635
You got it! Goodbye!

17:54.290 --> 17:56.597
You have
a very interesting marriage.

18:01.819 --> 18:02.864
Sheila.

18:02.907 --> 18:04.779
Um, what are you doing here?

18:04.822 --> 18:07.129
Our visit was cut short
yesterday, so I just...

18:07.173 --> 18:09.305
Now's not really a good time;
I'm feeling under the weather.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.394
Do you want me to run
to the drugstore for you?

18:11.438 --> 18:12.830
Oh, no, no. I just...

18:12.874 --> 18:14.397
need a couple of aspirin.

18:14.441 --> 18:16.138
Sit. I'll get them for you.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.574
Oh, you don't
have to do that.

18:17.618 --> 18:18.749
It's no trouble.

18:18.793 --> 18:21.404
Besides,
I have some good news.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.624
Oh. That's nice.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.974
I could use some.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.671
I've found you a man.

18:28.890 --> 18:31.110
His name's Eldon Ratzinger.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.068
Eldon Ratzinger.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.896
He's my butcher. Very nice.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.811
On the short side,
but you wouldn't notice

18:36.854 --> 18:38.639
if you're wearing flats.

18:38.682 --> 18:39.988
Thanks, but...

18:40.031 --> 18:42.860
I can't meet anyone for a while.

18:42.904 --> 18:45.733
You won't forget about Rob
if you sit around pouting.

18:45.776 --> 18:49.084
Trust me, I won't be forgetting
about Rob anytime soon.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.564
You've got
to get over this obsession

18:50.607 --> 18:52.653
with another woman's husband.

18:52.696 --> 18:56.744
You're going to end up
angry and sad.

18:56.787 --> 18:59.703
You are right
about that.

19:03.011 --> 19:04.665
You know,
flowers aren't the only thing

19:04.708 --> 19:05.796
that Rob left me with.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.234
What are you
talking about?

19:11.150 --> 19:12.455
I'm pregnant.

19:15.719 --> 19:18.722
Sheila,
are you hurt?

19:19.723 --> 19:21.029
Yes.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.292
Yes, I am.Let me get you a bandage.

19:37.915 --> 19:40.091
Oh.

19:40.135 --> 19:41.745
Let me get that for you,
my lady.

19:41.789 --> 19:42.616
Oh.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.226
And my other lady.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.619
How chivalrous of you.

19:45.662 --> 19:47.621
Thank you.

19:47.664 --> 19:49.318
All right.

20:11.166 --> 20:13.037
You want me
to drive for a bit?

20:13.081 --> 20:15.083
Hmm?

20:17.390 --> 20:19.348
Sorry.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.263
I think I'm just nervous

20:21.307 --> 20:22.917
about the script, you know?

20:22.960 --> 20:24.701
Actually, do you guys mind if
we pull off so I can call Lamar?

20:24.745 --> 20:26.703
Will that stop you
from playing the steering wheel

20:26.747 --> 20:27.791
like a bongo drum?

20:27.835 --> 20:28.879
Almost definitely.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.054
Then by all means.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.405
Okay, great.
Here we go.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.283
JADE:
Oh, great.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.509
I wonder if they
have a bathroom.

20:49.552 --> 20:52.338
Uh, we can ask
inside the mini-mart.

20:52.381 --> 20:54.296
Do you want anything?

20:54.340 --> 20:55.515
Uh, potato chips.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.343
And chocolate milk.

20:57.386 --> 20:59.214
And gummy worms,
if they have 'em.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.303
What are you, 12?

21:01.347 --> 21:03.044
I know you are, but what am I?

21:03.087 --> 21:06.177
The polyamorists
will hear about this.

21:39.602 --> 21:41.648
Fuck!

21:41.691 --> 21:43.302
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.260
JADE:
Bad news, Eli!

21:48.568 --> 21:50.091
They were out of worms.

21:50.134 --> 21:51.222
No.

21:51.266 --> 21:52.746
So I got you bears.

21:52.789 --> 21:53.834
Oh.

21:53.877 --> 21:54.922
Thank you.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.271
What are you doing in the trunk?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.969
Uh, looking for my baseball cap.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.710
Ah. So, where is it?

22:00.754 --> 22:02.712
Forgot to pack it.

22:02.756 --> 22:04.148
Fuckin' Eli.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.628
All right.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.195
Let's hit the road.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.722
Darling, is there any chance
you can watch the gallery

22:12.766 --> 22:13.897
for me this morning?

22:13.941 --> 22:15.116
Where will you be?

22:15.159 --> 22:16.422
Uh, I have an
appointment.

22:16.465 --> 22:18.075
Oh.

22:18.119 --> 22:20.164
And would this appointment
involve

22:20.208 --> 22:21.775
your new boyfriend Hector?

22:21.818 --> 22:24.821
He may tag along, yes.

22:24.865 --> 22:27.433
Look at you, proud gay man.

22:27.476 --> 22:29.260
You know I'd do anything
to support you.

22:29.304 --> 22:32.829
Short of canceling
my training session at the gym.

22:32.873 --> 22:35.354
Are you sure
you'renot a gay man?

22:37.268 --> 22:38.487
Naomi.

22:38.531 --> 22:40.663
I thought we were meeting
at the club.

22:40.707 --> 22:41.969
You never know
who's eavesdropping there.

22:42.012 --> 22:44.624
And what I have to say
is for your ears only.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.974
Mm. Hello, Naomi.

22:47.017 --> 22:48.758
My ears and I
were just leaving.

22:48.802 --> 22:49.803
Thank you.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.547
You seem upset.

22:54.590 --> 22:57.463
Remember when I told you
that Tommy was hiding something?

22:59.378 --> 23:01.205
I know his secret.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.556
You do?

23:03.599 --> 23:05.862
He's on drugs.

23:05.906 --> 23:07.168
Oh, thank God.

23:07.908 --> 23:11.520
That you finally figured it out.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.957
It's the only thing that
makes sense-- the secrecy,

23:14.001 --> 23:17.047
the long hours, the lock
on his bedroom door.

23:17.091 --> 23:19.441
Not to mention
the missing money.

23:19.485 --> 23:20.660
What money?

23:20.703 --> 23:23.271
He cashed in
his savings bond.

23:23.314 --> 23:25.229
They became his
when he turned 18.

23:25.273 --> 23:27.231
And I'm not supposed
to know,

23:27.275 --> 23:29.408
but my friend
at the bank tipped me off.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.671
I ask you, Simone,

23:31.714 --> 23:34.891
what else could he have bought
that cost $10,000?

23:35.936 --> 23:37.851
He spent $10,000?

23:39.940 --> 23:41.811
I knew you'd understand.

23:42.856 --> 23:43.900
Oh.

23:43.944 --> 23:46.337
You're such a good friend.

23:47.382 --> 23:50.080
I know we've had
our squabbles.

23:50.124 --> 23:51.255
But in a crisis like this,

23:51.299 --> 23:54.171
there is no one else
I can turn to.

23:55.216 --> 23:56.826
No one?

23:56.870 --> 23:59.263
What do you think
he's doing?

23:59.307 --> 24:01.483
Heroin?

24:01.527 --> 24:02.919
This is Tommy
we're talking about.

24:02.963 --> 24:04.791
I seriously doubt
he's on heroin.

24:04.834 --> 24:06.488
What? That's a beautiful brooch.

24:06.532 --> 24:07.750
Is it new?

24:07.794 --> 24:09.839
Then again, it could be heroin.

24:12.538 --> 24:13.930
All right.

24:13.974 --> 24:16.629
Oh, look at this place.
It's cute.Yeah.

24:18.805 --> 24:19.936
Here we go, come on.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.068
TAYLOR: Oh...ELI: Oh, man.

24:21.111 --> 24:23.200
JADE: Why are they
stopping everyone?

24:23.244 --> 24:24.941
Who knows?

24:24.985 --> 24:27.161
Look at all these cars.

24:27.204 --> 24:28.771
Who knew polyamory
was so popular?

24:31.295 --> 24:33.559
Oh, my God.

24:33.602 --> 24:36.649
Vice President Pence
is speaking here tonight.

24:36.692 --> 24:38.520
At a polyamory seminar?

24:38.564 --> 24:39.739
That's surprising.Odd choice.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.175
No.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.437
He's in a different ballroom.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.266
He's talking
to "local Republicans."

24:45.309 --> 24:47.442
Oh...Ugh. Well, that's the reason
for the holdup.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.531
It's extra security.

24:49.575 --> 24:53.492
Oh, security...

24:59.672 --> 25:01.064
They're opening
people's trunks.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.892
That's gonna take forever.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.809
Um...

25:11.161 --> 25:12.728
You know what, guys?

25:12.772 --> 25:16.166
Uh, we-we, we need
to turn around. Yeah.What?

25:16.210 --> 25:18.908
Why?Uh... I-I got to, I got to
pee, guys. I'm so sorry.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.562
I just...No, honey, I was kidding.

25:20.606 --> 25:22.172
The hotel is just
up the street.

25:22.216 --> 25:23.913
We'll be there in, like...Nope.

25:23.957 --> 25:25.654
: Can't do it. Dam's
gonna burst. Here-here we go...

25:25.698 --> 25:27.613
TAYLOR:
No, honey, wait, what are you
doing? What are you doing?

25:27.656 --> 25:28.701
Oh!I'm flipping a bitch.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.354
TAYLOR:
Wait-- Eli, what...

25:30.398 --> 25:31.312
You can't make a U-turn here.

25:31.355 --> 25:32.487
Yeah, well, now it's turning

25:32.531 --> 25:33.662
into a bit more
of a three-point thing.

25:33.706 --> 25:36.970
TAYLOR: Eli...JADE: Eli, no!

25:37.013 --> 25:37.927
Or four.Oh, my God!

25:37.971 --> 25:39.799
JADE:
Eli! Stop!

25:39.842 --> 25:41.888
Oh, my God.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.672
JADE:
Eli, what are you doing?

25:43.716 --> 25:46.283
They're gonna think that
we're terrorists or something.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.155
Five.

25:48.198 --> 25:49.809
See that? Smooth sailing.

25:49.852 --> 25:51.724
Have you lost your
fucking mind? Jesus...Smooth sailing.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.335
Eli, slow down!

25:54.378 --> 25:55.641
You're gonna get us all killed.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.120
ELI: Oh, wha-- everyone,
just calm down, okay?

25:57.164 --> 25:58.644
There's a Taco Bell
a couple miles down the road.

25:58.687 --> 26:00.036
Right? We'll stop there,
it's gonna be fine.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.082
All right?
Everything is gonna be fine.

26:06.739 --> 26:09.568
What?

26:09.611 --> 26:13.484
Stop the car. Now.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.922
All right.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.714
What-- Why are you
opening the trunk?

26:25.758 --> 26:27.847
Because I want to know
what's in there.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.892
Taylor!

26:33.156 --> 26:34.462
Shit.

26:34.505 --> 26:36.116
Eli, your nose.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.161
Oh...

26:38.205 --> 26:40.250
Fuck.

26:40.294 --> 26:41.643
Wait.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.783
Oh, my God. Eli.

26:50.826 --> 26:52.828
I-I know that it looks bad.

26:52.872 --> 26:55.048
Get in the car.
We're going home.

26:55.091 --> 26:56.615
W-What about the retreat?

26:56.658 --> 26:59.008
Oh, fuck the retreat.

27:13.849 --> 27:15.808
SHEILA:
Pregnant? Jesus.

27:15.851 --> 27:19.202
She's not only a tramp,
she's a stupid tramp.

27:19.246 --> 27:21.422
I don't want to drink right now.Oh, honey.

27:21.465 --> 27:24.599
This is all for me.
I find your life very stressful.

27:24.643 --> 27:28.429
At least we know why April was
so desperate to speak to Rob.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.476
How do you think he'll react?

27:33.695 --> 27:35.915
I think he will be thrilled.

27:37.133 --> 27:38.352
Really?

27:38.395 --> 27:41.834
Rob loved being a father.

27:41.877 --> 27:47.056
When we lost Emily--
that was our daughter's name...

27:47.100 --> 27:49.189
That's a beautiful name.

27:52.279 --> 27:55.021
When we lost Emily,
he couldn't accept it.

27:55.064 --> 27:57.458
Rob begged me
to have another child.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.547
Why didn't you?

27:59.590 --> 28:03.725
We tried and tried, but...

28:03.769 --> 28:06.423
Did you ever think
about adoption?

28:06.467 --> 28:08.556
Rob said he didn't want
to raise another man's baby.

28:08.599 --> 28:10.210
He wanted a child

28:10.253 --> 28:11.646
of his own.

28:13.082 --> 28:15.476
And now he's going to get one.

28:15.519 --> 28:17.826
God, I hate this guy.

28:17.870 --> 28:20.786
Ugh, please,
he's still my husband.

28:23.179 --> 28:25.573
What do I do now?

28:25.616 --> 28:28.576
Come clean.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.796
Tell him you know about
the affair, and the baby.

28:30.839 --> 28:33.755
No.It's time to put it
all on the table.

28:33.799 --> 28:34.930
But how will that help?

28:34.974 --> 28:36.323
It will force him

28:36.366 --> 28:37.759
to make a choice.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.762
You or her.

28:40.806 --> 28:45.158
What if... he doesn't choose me?

28:45.201 --> 28:47.769
Well, then you'll finally hate
the fucking bastard

28:47.813 --> 28:49.902
just as much as I do.

28:54.515 --> 28:58.301
No, I won't. That's the problem.

28:58.345 --> 29:02.741
Look, I don't know
what he's gonna do.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.786
Maybe he'll choose you.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.223
But whatever happens,

29:07.267 --> 29:09.965
aren't you done
with all the lies?

29:13.099 --> 29:15.579
Oh...

29:22.369 --> 29:23.892
COACH:
Okay, team, let's go. Heads up!

29:23.936 --> 29:26.242
Defense, north side
of the field.

29:26.286 --> 29:29.811
Offense, south side.
Let's go...

29:34.207 --> 29:36.165
Hey. What are you doing here?

29:36.209 --> 29:38.428
Why didn't you tell me
these diamonds were real?

29:38.472 --> 29:41.257
Yea-- of course they're real.
I thought you knew that.

29:41.301 --> 29:42.737
Well, I didn't. Take this back.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.217
No. Why would I do that?

29:44.260 --> 29:46.088
The bank told your mother
you sold a bond.

29:46.132 --> 29:48.351
She now thinks you're on drugs,
and knowing

29:48.395 --> 29:50.658
what you spent on this,
I'm wondering if she's right.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.138
I'm not taking it back.Tommy.

29:52.181 --> 29:54.314
I should be able to buy diamonds
for the woman I love.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.884
Relax. I don't expect you
to say it back.

29:58.927 --> 30:01.364
I gave you that so you'd see
that I'm not just some kid

30:01.408 --> 30:02.931
who can't play in your league.

30:02.975 --> 30:05.281
The diamonds are real
because my feelings are.

30:06.892 --> 30:09.068
You know I adore you,

30:09.111 --> 30:12.158
but I just don't see how we can
have that kind of relationship.

30:12.201 --> 30:14.203
Because of what people
would say?

30:14.247 --> 30:16.466
They'd be brutal.So, you're
not embarrassed

30:16.510 --> 30:18.381
that Karl dates men,
but you are embarrassed by me?

30:18.425 --> 30:19.905
I am not embarrassed at all.

30:19.948 --> 30:22.124
Oh, dear God.

30:22.168 --> 30:25.736
Hey, Tommy!
Who's your girlfriend?

30:25.780 --> 30:27.564
I-I can't stay here.

30:27.608 --> 30:30.176
Here, take this, please.TOMMY: No.

30:30.219 --> 30:33.832
It's yours.
I'm not ashamed to love you.

30:47.584 --> 30:49.717
Taylor...
Don't.

30:49.760 --> 30:52.546
I need for no one
to speak right now.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.646
How long?

31:07.213 --> 31:09.432
Sorry?

31:09.476 --> 31:12.609
How long have you
been using again?

31:13.915 --> 31:15.874
Not that long.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.876
I mean, it started...Don't tell me.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.790
I don't want to know how long
I missed the signs.

31:19.834 --> 31:21.183
How long this has been happening

31:21.227 --> 31:23.316
right in front
of my own stupid face.

31:23.359 --> 31:25.057
Babe, please, you...

31:25.100 --> 31:27.059
You-- shut up.

31:27.102 --> 31:30.062
I was distracted before.

31:30.105 --> 31:33.239
You'd better believe my eyes
are wide fucking open now.

31:51.126 --> 31:52.301
Hello?

31:52.345 --> 31:54.695
Tommy's dealing drugs.

31:54.738 --> 31:56.566
What?

31:56.610 --> 31:58.525
Kay Randall's son Bradley

31:58.568 --> 32:02.616
saw him today with a customer.

32:02.659 --> 32:04.270
A customer?

32:04.313 --> 32:08.187
He saw him making a deal
in the middle of P.E.

32:08.230 --> 32:10.754
with some seedy,
middle-aged woman

32:10.798 --> 32:13.583
in dark glasses.Middle-aged?

32:13.627 --> 32:14.976
Anyway,

32:15.020 --> 32:16.978
do you have a screwdriver?

32:17.022 --> 32:19.067
I want to break
into Tommy's room.

32:19.111 --> 32:21.026
Why? I'm sure he doesn't keep
drugs in there.

32:21.069 --> 32:23.376
Maybe not, but at least
I could read his journal.

32:24.464 --> 32:26.422
His journal?

32:26.466 --> 32:28.598
I think I found one.

32:28.642 --> 32:30.905
W-Well, what do you mean,
he keeps a journal?

32:30.949 --> 32:32.863
I-I have to go.

32:32.907 --> 32:35.736
Naomi. Uh...

32:57.932 --> 33:00.326
Naomi?
NAOMI:
Up here!

33:08.769 --> 33:11.032
Naomi.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.208
I'm so glad you're here.
You can help me look.

33:13.252 --> 33:15.994
I am only here to stop you
from making an awful mistake.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.387
If Tommy finds out
you read his journal,

33:18.431 --> 33:19.736
you could lose him forever.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.869
He won't find out.
He's at track until 6:00.

33:21.912 --> 33:23.871
You trashed his room. You won't
have time to clean it up.

33:23.914 --> 33:25.829
And the journal
may not even be here.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.875
Found it.

33:27.918 --> 33:29.398
Simone.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.052
When Amy was ten,
I read her diary.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.836
She didn't speak to me
for a year.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.883
Hand it over.If she had been
Tommy's age,

33:35.926 --> 33:37.667
she'd have moved out.

33:37.711 --> 33:39.974
Do you really want to risk that,
just to get an intrusive look

33:40.018 --> 33:42.977
at Tommy's most
private thoughts and...

33:43.021 --> 33:44.935
Jesus Christ. Nothing!What?

33:44.979 --> 33:46.589
Give me that.

33:46.633 --> 33:48.678
As your friend, I am
begging you, don't read that.

33:48.722 --> 33:50.767
Why are you so emotional?

33:52.943 --> 33:54.597
Karl is gay.

33:55.990 --> 33:57.992
What?He sleeps with men.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.299
Uh-- can we just focus
on my problems for a moment?

34:00.342 --> 34:01.474
No wonder you're so distraught.

34:01.517 --> 34:03.084
I mean,
I wanted to tell you,

34:03.128 --> 34:05.608
but then I thought,
"No, Naomi has her own problems.

34:05.652 --> 34:07.828
She doesn't want to hear
my tawdry tale."

34:07.871 --> 34:09.612
Oh, but I do.

34:23.365 --> 34:24.584
NAOMI:
You mean to tell me

34:24.627 --> 34:26.716
that when I saw Karl's
car at the motel,

34:26.760 --> 34:29.241
he was there with a man?

34:29.284 --> 34:31.765
I can't talk about this
without a drink.

34:31.808 --> 34:33.201
Maybe we could
go downstairs and,

34:33.245 --> 34:34.550
you know,
open up a bottle?

34:34.594 --> 34:36.291
Of course.
But how did you find out?

34:36.335 --> 34:38.293
Did you catch him with
one of his lovers?

34:38.337 --> 34:39.729
SIMONE:
No, it was Wanda.
You were right.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.166
She despises me.

34:41.209 --> 34:42.950
She found out...What are you doing in my room?

34:47.998 --> 34:49.826
Is that my journal?

34:49.870 --> 34:51.654
Uh, she just found it,

34:51.698 --> 34:53.395
but she hasn't read it yet.

34:53.439 --> 34:56.050
I'm so sorry, Tommy.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.357
I just wanted to make sure
that you weren't doing drugs.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.968
So you broke into my room?

35:01.011 --> 35:03.144
Well, you've been
so distant lately.

35:03.188 --> 35:06.016
Mrs. Grove,
if you wouldn't mind...

35:06.060 --> 35:09.368
Yes, I should go, as this
doesn't involve me at all.

35:11.935 --> 35:14.329
Jesus. Mom...

35:20.727 --> 35:22.511
You looking for these?

35:22.555 --> 35:24.948
Oh, good, you found them.
Thank you.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.167
How'd it go in there?

35:26.211 --> 35:27.951
Eh, just told Mom
that I'm gonna

35:27.995 --> 35:30.780
cash in another bond so I can
hike through Europe this summer.

35:30.824 --> 35:32.173
She felt so guilty
about breaking

35:32.217 --> 35:33.827
into my room that she agreed.

35:33.870 --> 35:36.482
You turned the situation
to your advantage.

35:36.525 --> 35:38.005
Good for you.

35:40.399 --> 35:43.837
I, uh, leave for Paris
two days after graduation.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.926
Care to join me?

35:46.970 --> 35:48.929
Are you crazy?

35:48.972 --> 35:50.583
We don't have to leave
at the same time.

35:50.626 --> 35:52.541
I'll go first,
then you take a vacation

35:52.585 --> 35:53.586
and meet me there.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.763
No one's gonna know
that we're together.

35:56.806 --> 35:57.938
Your mother's watching.

36:02.551 --> 36:03.726
That is why we
need to do this.

36:03.770 --> 36:05.467
Someone is always
watching us here.

36:05.511 --> 36:08.035
We will never know who we can be
as a couple until we get away

36:08.078 --> 36:09.428
from my mom, your friends,

36:09.471 --> 36:11.821
and everyone else whose
opinions you're scared of.

36:16.348 --> 36:17.871
Can I think about it?

36:19.264 --> 36:20.700
Sure.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.335
Wow.

36:47.379 --> 36:49.729
Look at this.

36:49.772 --> 36:51.731
Someone went to
a lot of trouble.

36:51.774 --> 36:53.341
Oh, not so much.

36:53.385 --> 36:55.996
I just put out a few flowers,
and the good silver,

36:56.039 --> 36:57.519
and the candlesticks
your mother bought us.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.479
Would you like a mai tai
before dinner?

37:00.522 --> 37:03.090
You made mai tais?

37:03.133 --> 37:04.700
Hold it.
Did you wreck the car?

37:04.744 --> 37:06.746
Why would you think that?

37:06.789 --> 37:09.705
You only make mai tais
before giving me bad news.

37:09.749 --> 37:11.316
That's silly.Huh.

37:11.359 --> 37:12.534
Now drink your mai tai.

37:38.517 --> 37:39.735
Where do you think you're going?

37:40.780 --> 37:41.998
Upstairs.

37:42.042 --> 37:43.391
Not alone, you're not.

37:43.435 --> 37:44.566
In fact, this is what's

37:44.610 --> 37:45.915
gonna happen right now.

37:45.959 --> 37:47.917
You and I are gonna
take a tour of this house,

37:47.961 --> 37:49.963
and you're gonna show me where
you've been hiding your stash.

37:51.356 --> 37:54.315
There's no stash. I just...And you know what, Eli,

37:54.359 --> 37:55.708
put all that shit down,

37:55.751 --> 37:57.797
because you have absolutely
no reason to unpack.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.365
You're going to rehab
first thing in the morning.

38:00.408 --> 38:02.323
Are you kidding? Rehab?

38:02.367 --> 38:03.455
Come on.

38:03.498 --> 38:05.587
I want your wallet.
And your phone.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.328
You are cut off.

38:07.372 --> 38:11.506
No cash, no cards,
no PayPal, no Venmo.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.334
Do you understand?

38:17.599 --> 38:19.427
You know, I understand
why you're upset,

38:19.471 --> 38:20.602
but you don't have to
humiliate me

38:20.646 --> 38:21.951
in front of Jade, too.Wrong.

38:21.995 --> 38:23.910
You should be humiliated.

38:23.953 --> 38:25.999
After what we went through
last time,

38:26.042 --> 38:28.088
the idea that you would even
put us through this again...

38:29.698 --> 38:31.221
Eli, give it to me.It's Lamar.

38:31.265 --> 38:32.527
He'll leave a message.Just-- It could be

38:32.571 --> 38:33.702
about the script.
Just...

38:33.746 --> 38:35.617
please let me
take the call.

38:35.661 --> 38:37.576
Fine.

38:38.577 --> 38:40.709
Stay where I can see you.

38:40.753 --> 38:41.754
Hey.

38:41.797 --> 38:44.887
Yeah...Tay...

38:44.931 --> 38:47.586
I want to help.
Just tell me what I can do.

38:47.629 --> 38:48.804
ELI:
How much?

38:48.848 --> 38:53.287
Just... be with me.ELI: Yeah.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.376
Back me up. This is
gonna be really hard.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.204
But it's the only way.

38:57.247 --> 38:59.902
Hey, you got it. Of course.

38:59.946 --> 39:01.730
ELI:
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

39:06.474 --> 39:07.649
What did Lamar say?

39:07.693 --> 39:11.174
He-he was able to start
a bidding war...

39:12.785 --> 39:15.178
...and he sold it for a lot more
than we expected.

39:15.222 --> 39:17.006
How much more?

39:17.050 --> 39:18.660
One-point-two.

39:18.704 --> 39:20.532
One-point-two?Million.

39:20.575 --> 39:22.795
1.2 million.

39:23.839 --> 39:25.363
Holy shit.Yeah.

39:25.406 --> 39:26.799
Oh, my God.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.148
JADE:
Oh, my God!

39:28.191 --> 39:31.412
Are you serious?
Oh, my God.

39:31.456 --> 39:34.502
Eli, congratulations.Oh, my God, thank you.
Thank you.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.374
Oh, my God.Yes!

39:36.417 --> 39:37.723
Honey, this is
such great news, okay?

39:37.766 --> 39:39.507
Your career
is back again.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.814
This is all the more reason
to get you to rehab.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.861
You-you know what?

39:45.905 --> 39:47.820
I-I don't, I don't think
it's the best time for me,

39:47.863 --> 39:49.169
right now.

39:49.212 --> 39:52.651
Buddy... you don't really
have a choice here.

39:54.043 --> 39:56.437
I just sold a script
for $1.2 million.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.961
You know? I think
I got a lot of fucking choices.

39:59.005 --> 40:02.661
Eli... I am not gonna stand by
and watch you kill yourself.

40:02.704 --> 40:05.968
Oh, God.
Come on.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.840
This is not like
last time, all right?

40:07.883 --> 40:09.755
I'm in a completely
better place now.
Eli!

40:09.798 --> 40:12.671
This is nonnegotiable.

40:12.714 --> 40:14.194
Taylor...Do you know what...?

40:14.237 --> 40:16.588
You're so fucking desperate
to control me, aren't you?

40:16.631 --> 40:18.546
I mean, it's
fucking pathetic!Okay. No, Eli,

40:18.590 --> 40:21.244
this is the drugs talking.
You know that, right?No. No. No, it's not.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.943
This is me, okay? I am clear
as a fucking bell right now.

40:23.986 --> 40:27.555
And from now on...
I make my own decisions.

40:27.599 --> 40:30.819
Okay, Eli.
Well, here's one for you:

40:30.863 --> 40:35.389
either you go to rehab,
or I walk out that fucking door!

40:35.433 --> 40:37.130
Whoa. Hold on. Hold on.Really?

40:37.173 --> 40:38.827
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Really? You
just walk on out?

40:38.871 --> 40:42.004
If you push me, yeah.Okay. Well, Taylor,

40:42.048 --> 40:44.180
you know, I really
wish you wouldn't go.

40:44.224 --> 40:47.401
But if you want to,
that's your choice.

40:49.142 --> 40:52.624
See? I would never force
you to do anything.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.889
Come on, Jade.

41:01.371 --> 41:03.069
Jade...

41:05.114 --> 41:08.770
I-- I think maybe
we shouldn't go.

41:10.598 --> 41:13.906
You what?Eli needs help.

41:13.949 --> 41:16.561
I think maybe the best way
to help him is to

41:16.604 --> 41:19.781
stay here and-and,
you know,

41:19.825 --> 41:21.957
just keep
an eye on him.

41:23.002 --> 41:24.569
You're choosing him.

41:24.612 --> 41:27.354
I'm choosing us.
I'm choosing all of us.

41:27.397 --> 41:31.314
Fuck you.
Fuck you both.

41:42.151 --> 41:43.979
ROB:
Mmm.

41:45.459 --> 41:48.157
I can't believe
you made peach cobbler.

41:48.201 --> 41:50.856
I know it's
your favorite.
Mmm.

41:50.899 --> 41:53.598
You must've been
cooking since noon.

41:53.641 --> 41:55.600
I didn't start
all that early.

41:55.643 --> 41:59.429
Well, thanks for this.
It was a beautiful night.

42:01.301 --> 42:03.042
You're welcome.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.655
Aw, geez.

42:07.699 --> 42:09.439
I knew it.
Something's going on.

42:09.483 --> 42:11.572
Robert?

42:11.616 --> 42:14.923
And you're calling me Robert?
Ah, this is gonna be bad, huh?

42:14.967 --> 42:17.056
We definitely need
to have a talk.

42:17.099 --> 42:18.927
Ah, boy.

42:18.971 --> 42:20.494
First...

42:20.538 --> 42:23.323
I just want to say...

42:24.846 --> 42:27.501
...I love you so much.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.373
Mm.And more importantly,

42:30.417 --> 42:35.030
I love us.
And the life we've had.

42:35.074 --> 42:37.206
You're starting to scare me.

42:37.250 --> 42:39.208
I'm scared, too.

42:44.997 --> 42:47.913
What's going on?
What's wrong?

42:47.956 --> 42:50.263
Just tell me.

42:53.179 --> 42:55.529
Once I tell you...

42:57.444 --> 43:00.621
...everything is going
to be different.

43:00.665 --> 43:04.233
Oh, my God.
Are you sick?

43:10.500 --> 43:12.285
Yes.

43:13.373 --> 43:15.505
I'm sick.

43:15.549 --> 43:17.551
Baby, what's wrong?

43:19.597 --> 43:21.816
I have cancer.

43:23.862 --> 43:27.909
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

43:27.953 --> 43:30.477
Oh... oh, my God.

44:09.037 --> 44:10.909
Oh, nice flowers.

44:10.952 --> 44:12.954
Are they from Hector?

44:12.998 --> 44:15.261
How many men
do you think I'm juggling?

44:15.304 --> 44:17.567
Oh, glad one of us
is having a good day.

44:17.611 --> 44:21.702
Oh, God,
I look like a raccoon.

44:21.746 --> 44:24.662
I cannot tell you what
I've been through today.

44:25.706 --> 44:27.969
I'm guessing you'll try.

44:28.013 --> 44:29.710
You know the pin
Tommy gave me?

44:29.754 --> 44:32.626
Well, it turns out
the diamonds were real.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.063
Naomi was
furious, because

44:35.107 --> 44:37.979
he cashed in one of his
savings bonds to buy it.

44:38.023 --> 44:41.200
Anyway, she decided
he was on drugs.

44:41.243 --> 44:42.636
: And that she had
to read his journal...

44:42.680 --> 44:44.986
DOCTOR:
Mr. Grove. How can I help you?

44:45.030 --> 44:46.509
KARL:
Well, I was with my friend,

44:46.553 --> 44:48.555
and he-he spotted
this thing on my back.

44:48.598 --> 44:49.948
I mean, it's probably nothing,

44:49.991 --> 44:52.472
but he-he suggested
I see a doctor.

44:52.515 --> 44:55.562
DOCTOR:
You were right to come see me.

44:55.605 --> 44:59.174
I am just relieved that
Naomi didn't find out.

44:59.218 --> 45:00.393
Anyway...

45:00.436 --> 45:04.702
before I left, Tommy ran out,

45:04.745 --> 45:06.529
and said something
that I definitely need

45:06.573 --> 45:07.705
to talk to you about.

45:07.748 --> 45:10.882
Oh, dear.
Am I going to need

45:10.925 --> 45:13.667
more wine-- Oh!

45:13.711 --> 45:14.842
Damn it!

45:17.192 --> 45:18.541
Oh, is it bad?
Let me see...
No!

45:18.585 --> 45:22.589
No, no. No, no, sorry.
Um, uh, it-it's not deep.

45:22.632 --> 45:26.071
Um... Can you just
get me a Band-Aid?

45:26.114 --> 45:27.594
Of course.

45:28.638 --> 45:31.685
Uh, uh, so, uh,
what did Tommy say?

45:31.729 --> 45:34.470
Well, he's going to
Europe for the summer,

45:34.514 --> 45:36.342
and he wants me
to join him.

45:36.385 --> 45:38.387
Oh.

45:42.261 --> 45:43.784
I know it sounds crazy,

45:43.828 --> 45:46.744
but I thought it might be nice
to spend time with him...

45:46.787 --> 45:48.789
and not have to sneak around.
What do you think?

45:51.966 --> 45:53.925
You should go.

45:53.968 --> 45:57.798
Really? I mean, it's a hectic
time, with Amy's wedding,

45:57.842 --> 45:58.973
and the gallery...Listen,

45:59.017 --> 46:00.322
listen.

46:00.366 --> 46:02.455
I have spent my entire life
putting off things

46:02.498 --> 46:04.631
that I thought there'd be
time for later.

46:06.241 --> 46:08.766
Open doors
don't stay open forever.

46:10.768 --> 46:14.772
So please... go.

46:16.034 --> 46:18.123
You'll be okay?

46:20.168 --> 46:22.257
I'll be delightful.

46:22.301 --> 46:25.565
I'll bet.

46:25.608 --> 46:29.699
Judging from those flowers,
Hector must be smitten.

46:29.743 --> 46:32.137
