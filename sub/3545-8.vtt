00:00.208 --> 00:01.917
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.041 --> 00:04.583
- I want to move this place fast.
- I'll call you.

00:04.667 --> 00:05.792
Edie, wait.

00:05.875 --> 00:09.250
<i>...incomprehensible that Edie Britt</i>
<i>would try to destroy us.</i>

00:09.375 --> 00:12.000
For five grand she's hurt,
ten grand she's gone.

00:12.125 --> 00:13.792
<i>Some neighbors hired help.</i>

00:13.875 --> 00:17.125
How can I pull off a formal dinner
with no warning?

00:17.208 --> 00:19.375
<i>And some helped themselves.</i>

00:19.500 --> 00:22.959
- I hate that she watches us.
<i>- Some just couldn't stop.</i>

00:23.041 --> 00:24.500
Smile, Gabrielle.

00:24.583 --> 00:28.458
<i>And one didn't stop in time.</i>

00:29.875 --> 00:32.625
- Andrew, I need your help, honey.
- Mama?

00:37.125 --> 00:41.041
<i>There is a widely read book</i>
<i>that tells us everyone is a sinner.</i>

00:41.125 --> 00:43.542
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>not everyone who reads this book</i>

00:43.625 --> 00:46.166
<i>feels guilt over the bad things they do.</i>

00:46.291 --> 00:48.834
<i>But Bree Van De Kamp did.</i>

00:48.917 --> 00:53.208
<i>In fact, Bree had spent</i>
<i>most of her life feeling guilty.</i>

00:53.291 --> 00:57.834
<i>As a child, she felt guilty</i>
<i>about not getting straight As.</i>

00:59.083 --> 01:05.291
<i>As a teenager, she felt guilty about</i>
<i>letting her boyfriend go to second base.</i>

01:05.375 --> 01:08.625
<i>As a newlywed, she felt guilty</i>
<i>about taking three weeks</i>

01:08.709 --> 01:11.083
<i>to get out her thank-you cards.</i>

01:11.208 --> 01:13.667
<i>But she knew</i>
<i>the transgressions of her past</i>

01:13.750 --> 01:17.417
<i>were nothing compared with</i>
<i>the sin she was about to commit.</i>

01:17.500 --> 01:20.166
Can't we just tell the police
it was an accident?

01:20.250 --> 01:22.792
This wasn't some simple DUI.

01:22.917 --> 01:26.208
Not only was Andrew drinking,
he left the scene of the crime.

01:26.291 --> 01:29.166
- That makes it a hit-and-run.
- I could go to Canada.

01:29.291 --> 01:32.291
Till the statute of limitations is up.

01:32.417 --> 01:35.750
You think Mum and Dad will pay
for you to go moose hunting?

01:35.834 --> 01:38.959
If she dies,
there is no statute of limitations.

01:39.041 --> 01:40.834
- Then it's murder.
- Shut up.

01:40.959 --> 01:45.083
- You shut up.
- It was an accident.

01:46.959 --> 01:49.792
We have to get rid of the car.

01:56.208 --> 01:59.917
But we can't sell it. The police might
find it and there could be DNA.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.875
We'll take it to a bad part of town,

02:02.000 --> 02:05.166
leave the keys in the ignition
and the doors unlocked.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.083
If the police don't find it
we'll get the insurance

02:08.166 --> 02:12.583
and if they do,
it wasn't in our possession.

02:12.667 --> 02:15.000
Anyone could have hit Mrs. Solis.

02:15.083 --> 02:18.208
That sounds good.

02:18.333 --> 02:20.333
Bree, are you sure?

02:20.458 --> 02:24.083
Our son could spend the rest of his life
in jail. I won't allow that.

02:24.166 --> 02:27.625
<i>Bree knew what</i>
<i>she was about to do was wrong.</i>

02:27.709 --> 02:31.959
<i>But like most sinners, she would</i>
<i>worry about her guilt tomorrow.</i>

02:32.041 --> 02:34.750
Everybody should go wash up.

02:35.959 --> 02:38.166
We're having pancakes for breakfast.

03:22.250 --> 03:24.083
<i>Not since my own suicide</i>

03:24.208 --> 03:28.041
<i>had violence intruded upon</i>
<i>the serenity of life on Wisteria Lane</i>

03:28.125 --> 03:30.333
<i>in such a conspicuous fashion.</i>

03:30.417 --> 03:34.125
<i>Needless to say,</i>
<i>my friends attacked the problem head-on.</i>

03:34.208 --> 03:38.417
<i>Lynette brought the broom,</i>
<i>Susan brought the trash bags,</i>

03:38.542 --> 03:41.792
<i>and Bree brought</i>
<i>the industrial strength solvent.</i>

03:43.041 --> 03:45.834
- That stuff is strong.
- It has to be.

03:45.917 --> 03:50.083
I don't want Gabrielle and Carlos
coming home to this ugly reminder.

03:51.417 --> 03:55.500
- Has anyone been over there?
- Julie and I went over this morning.

03:55.583 --> 03:59.667
- How's Juanita doing?
- She's in a coma.

03:59.750 --> 04:02.291
Nobody knows when
or even if she'll wake up.

04:02.417 --> 04:05.125
This is awful.
Carlos must be just devastated.

04:05.208 --> 04:08.333
I hope she wakes up
and tells us who was driving that car.

04:08.417 --> 04:10.959
We can only hope.

04:11.083 --> 04:16.125
Slow down, you jerk.
This is a residential neighborhood.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.542
That's quite a pitching arm.

04:19.667 --> 04:24.083
I've got four kids. I was up all night
reading statistics online.

04:24.166 --> 04:28.166
One out of every four traffic accidents
happens on residential streets.

04:28.291 --> 04:32.041
I hope whoever hit Juanita
gets put away for life.

04:32.125 --> 04:34.875
Don't you think
that's a little bit extreme?

04:34.959 --> 04:39.792
An innocent woman gets hit by a car and
the driver takes off? It's not extreme.

04:45.959 --> 04:48.917
You should go home and get some rest.
Eat something.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.583
You have messages from work.
Tanaka called. Said it was urgent.

04:52.667 --> 04:56.417
- I can stay here with your mother.
- I need to be here if she wakes up.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.083
You can't go on like this.

04:59.166 --> 05:03.208
What if she dies? People slip into comas
all the time and never come out.

05:03.333 --> 05:06.333
Don't say that.
We need to stay positive.

05:07.542 --> 05:10.291
- Mr. and Mrs. Solis.
- John.

05:12.625 --> 05:15.500
- Is it OK if I come in?
- Of course.

05:22.959 --> 05:26.542
Mr. Solis, I'm so sorry this happened.

05:26.625 --> 05:29.750
It means a lot that you came.

05:40.375 --> 05:44.709
I think I'm gonna go down
to the chapel and pray.

05:44.834 --> 05:47.125
You wanna come?

05:47.208 --> 05:49.875
No. I think I will stay here with Mama.

05:54.166 --> 05:57.709
- Is it all right if I come?
- Of course.

05:57.792 --> 06:00.125
We need all the prayers we can get.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.333
Mrs. Solis,
it's time for her sponge bath.

06:13.417 --> 06:15.291
Come again?

06:15.375 --> 06:19.917
Sometimes family members prefer to
administer sponge baths themselves.

06:22.417 --> 06:23.750
I'll pass.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.166
Martha.

06:32.583 --> 06:35.667
- Where's your purse?
- Over there. Why?

06:41.792 --> 06:46.458
- What are you doing?
- Taking back the $40 you stole.

06:46.542 --> 06:49.333
- Edie.
- I know you did it. Hand it over.

06:49.458 --> 06:52.333
I have taken nothing from your purse.

06:52.417 --> 06:56.458
If you're missing money, I'd ask one
of those men you parade through here.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.041
I am not going to apologize
for having a healthy sex life.

07:01.125 --> 07:03.709
Healthy? I'm going to
have to burn every sheet.

07:03.792 --> 07:07.917
- I want my money.
- I want those non-fat peach yogurts.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.500
They didn't just walk out of the fridge.

07:10.625 --> 07:14.083
You can deduct it from the $40
that you're going to give me now.

07:14.166 --> 07:17.166
You're my best friend.
Why would I steal from you?

07:17.250 --> 07:20.375
It's no secret you've been
having financial problems.

07:20.458 --> 07:23.875
- I hear you bitching to your bank.
- That's it.

07:23.959 --> 07:26.625
I can put up with your debauchery
and food theft,

07:26.750 --> 07:28.625
but I will not tolerate spying.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.750
- I want you out.
- You don't mean that.

07:30.834 --> 07:34.500
Yes, I do. I'm leaving tomorrow
to visit my sister for a few days.

07:34.583 --> 07:36.959
I want you gone by the time I get back.

07:37.041 --> 07:39.583
I'll do you one better.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.166
I will leave today.

07:54.083 --> 07:57.709
I hope this works. My sleep cycle's
totally out of whack.

07:57.834 --> 08:01.333
I'm up all night,
then dozing off during the day.

08:01.417 --> 08:04.041
Trust me. This will do the trick.

08:04.166 --> 08:07.583
In fact, you should be
feeling more relaxed already.

08:08.208 --> 08:10.333
You know, you're right.

08:11.500 --> 08:15.667
Boys, I can hear you out there.
Be quiet. Just sit there and color.

08:15.750 --> 08:19.458
- Now is not a good time to be moving.
- Sorry.

08:19.542 --> 08:22.291
Just block everything out

08:22.375 --> 08:25.125
and let it go.

08:25.208 --> 08:27.625
Imagine that you're in a forest.

08:27.709 --> 08:30.709
There's a babbling brook nearby.

08:30.792 --> 08:35.000
And the wind is just coming
through the trees...

08:35.083 --> 08:36.625
- Mummy?
- Parker.

08:36.709 --> 08:39.709
I don't know
what you think you're doing,

08:39.792 --> 08:42.792
but put that back where it belongs.

08:43.750 --> 08:49.125
Sorry.
You were saying something about wind.

08:49.208 --> 08:52.375
I was just creating a soothing image.

08:54.208 --> 08:56.625
Oh, for the love of God.

08:57.542 --> 09:00.709
Knock it off, you little monsters.

09:03.250 --> 09:05.834
Mrs. Scavo, lie down.
We need to finish this.

09:05.917 --> 09:09.834
I'm on my last nerves,
so I'm gonna level with you here.

09:09.917 --> 09:15.625
I've screwed up my entire system
by taking my kids' ADD medication.

09:15.709 --> 09:19.625
Yeah, you heard me. I plan to stop.
But right now I need to sleep

09:19.709 --> 09:24.458
and I need more than a few crappy
needles, so what have you got?

09:24.542 --> 09:26.375
I'm not licensed to write prescriptions.

09:26.458 --> 09:28.583
I know you're not.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.041
This will put you to sleep.
It's a very powerful herbal remedy.

09:41.125 --> 09:43.500
Promise me you'll use it judiciously.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.750
Sure. Whatever.

09:48.291 --> 09:49.917
Knock, knock.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.959
- Hey. Come on in.
- You're a mess.

09:54.125 --> 09:57.125
I'm tearing out the leaky pipes
in the bathroom.

09:57.917 --> 10:02.458
- Wall-to-wall rotten wood.
- Sounds like a job.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.792
Julie said that you came by before.

10:07.625 --> 10:12.291
I was thinking of driving to the Germani
vineyard tomorrow for a wine tasting...

10:12.375 --> 10:14.959
- What time should I be ready?
- About 6:00.

10:15.083 --> 10:17.792
6:00 is good.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.083
All right.

10:20.166 --> 10:24.333
I thought afterwards we could have
a little dinner, maybe some dancing.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.709
Sounds great.

10:27.458 --> 10:30.125
You do know that
it's a two-hour drive up there.

10:30.208 --> 10:34.250
Isn't that kind of late
to be coming back?

10:34.333 --> 10:38.083
I thought if worse came to worse
we could grab a room.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.417
Oh? Like a hotel room?

10:40.500 --> 10:44.041
- Yeah. As a last resort.
- Of course. Yes.

10:44.125 --> 10:47.583
So maybe we should make a reservation.
You know, just in case.

10:47.667 --> 10:52.542
Yeah, I found some hotels online.
Let me get the print-out.

10:53.917 --> 10:57.166
Hey, Bongo. Come here.
Do you want a treat?

10:57.250 --> 11:00.375
- Where do you keep the dog biscuits?
- Sorry, what?

11:00.458 --> 11:01.709
Never mind.

11:01.834 --> 11:04.834
We'll just find them ourselves.

11:14.542 --> 11:18.083
Sorry, I couldn't hear you.
What did you say?

11:19.291 --> 11:22.250
Nothing. It's not important.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.500
It's my tiler guy.
Here. See what looks good.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.875
Hey, Phil.

11:29.959 --> 11:33.333
No, tomorrow morning
I'm making a lumber run. That's no good.

11:33.417 --> 11:36.250
No, I'm gone tomorrow night, too.

11:36.333 --> 11:40.667
- I could let him in.
- No, it's OK. Thanks.

11:40.750 --> 11:44.417
It's fine. Just give me the key.
I'll be around all day.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.333
All right. Thanks.

11:47.417 --> 11:51.166
Phil, I'll give a key to my neighbor.
She'll be here to let you in.

12:00.083 --> 12:02.917
<i>Like every city,</i>
<i>Fairview had a neighborhood</i>

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
<i>that was less than desirable.</i>

12:05.083 --> 12:08.750
<i>It was an accepted fact, anyone</i>
<i>who lingered there after midnight</i>

12:08.834 --> 12:11.000
<i>was usually up to no good.</i>

12:14.542 --> 12:18.083
<i>Rex and Bree Van De Kamp</i>
<i>were no exception.</i>

12:29.375 --> 12:31.667
You really think this is gonna work?

12:31.750 --> 12:34.458
This is an impoverished
neighborhood.

12:34.542 --> 12:38.083
- Trust me. Somebody will steal the car.
- How can you be so sure?

12:38.166 --> 12:40.709
Because I have faith in the poor.

12:43.291 --> 12:47.625
She's so beautiful.
I shot this last year on her birthday.

12:51.291 --> 12:55.500
- How are you going to do it?
- I made contact with her at a bar.

12:55.625 --> 12:58.000
She thinks I'm a real-estate developer.

12:58.125 --> 13:01.333
- Is she going to suffer?
- No.

13:01.458 --> 13:04.792
Edie Britt will disappear
and you'll go back to your life.

13:04.875 --> 13:10.417
Before you do it, do you think you could
ask her why she sent this to my wife?

13:10.542 --> 13:14.375
You can't think like that.
You can't give in to your curiosity.

13:14.500 --> 13:18.792
Curiosity leads to guilt.
Guilt leads to talking.

13:18.875 --> 13:21.000
Do you still have questions?

13:22.625 --> 13:26.667
I want to be clear about something. If
I walk away with this cash, it's done.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.792
No refunds. No buyer's remorse.

13:29.750 --> 13:31.375
I get it.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.417
We won't talk again,
so I'll ask one more time.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.667
Are you sure you want this?

13:37.834 --> 13:40.041
My wife is dead because of Edie Britt.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.542
I absolutely want this.

13:49.959 --> 13:52.500
You've been awfully quiet.

13:55.083 --> 13:59.208
I've just been thinking about the kids.

14:02.709 --> 14:05.208
They sure grew up quickly, didn't they?

14:05.291 --> 14:07.542
They sure did.

14:09.208 --> 14:12.792
I told them when they were babies
that they shouldn't get bigger

14:12.875 --> 14:15.375
because they were so adorable.

14:16.333 --> 14:20.250
- And we were so happy.
- Yeah, well...

14:21.041 --> 14:23.834
They sure didn't turn out
like we expected them to.

14:23.917 --> 14:26.667
No. They didn't.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.792
We could have been better parents.

14:29.875 --> 14:33.959
- We weren't that bad.
- We still have so much to teach them.

14:34.083 --> 14:37.166
We need to show Andrew
the enormity of what he's done.

14:37.250 --> 14:39.834
I suppose we could punish him.

14:39.917 --> 14:43.917
What's the appropriate punishment
for a child who drives over a woman?

14:44.041 --> 14:46.834
I don't know.

14:48.083 --> 14:50.959
No matter how the kids turn out,
I still love them.

14:51.041 --> 14:53.500
Course you do.

14:53.583 --> 14:56.875
But I'll never forgive them
for growing up so quickly.

15:01.583 --> 15:04.375
Hey, look.

15:17.959 --> 15:21.041
I opened the cabinet
and there was all this money in it.

15:21.125 --> 15:25.417
- There was wads of it.
- You're freaking out over cash?

15:25.500 --> 15:28.291
Realistically,
I've known this guy a few weeks.

15:28.375 --> 15:30.500
He could be a hit man for the mob.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.709
Why are you going on a trip with him?

15:32.792 --> 15:34.583
I never get out of the house.

15:34.667 --> 15:38.834
If you need to freak out, remember that
you're spending the night with Mike.

15:38.917 --> 15:42.166
No man has seen you naked in years.
Except your doctor.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.792
He retired.
I try not to take that personally.

15:44.917 --> 15:47.500
You look old in that.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.959
Maybe I am being silly.

15:50.041 --> 15:53.375
But going to a hotel with a man
is a big deal to me.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.959
What if Mike is hiding something?

15:56.041 --> 16:00.083
- Like what?
- I don't know.

16:00.166 --> 16:02.375
That's Dad. I gotta go.

16:02.458 --> 16:06.542
Now, listen. No more freaking out.
I need this weekend to go well.

16:06.625 --> 16:10.500
- Why do you care so much?
- I'm gonna have a husband some day.

16:10.583 --> 16:13.834
I really don't want you living with us.

16:18.375 --> 16:21.417
- Are the lady fingers OK?
- They're terrific.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.834
We just appreciate you all stopping by.

16:23.959 --> 16:26.417
We just wanted you to know
how much we care.

16:26.500 --> 16:30.125
So have the police
come up with any leads?

16:30.208 --> 16:33.792
Not really. They can determine
the make and model of the car,

16:33.875 --> 16:37.208
but without eyewitnesses,
no one seems very optimistic.

16:37.333 --> 16:40.125
Is there any good news about Juanita?

16:40.208 --> 16:43.875
No change. All we can do
is wait and hope for the best.

16:45.208 --> 16:48.875
- We put her on our prayer list.
- That's very sweet. Thank you.

16:48.959 --> 16:53.917
It must really help
during times like these, having kids.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.875
Yeah. They're a blessing.

16:56.959 --> 16:59.834
Children make everything worthwhile.

17:01.375 --> 17:04.500
You guys are the future. Legacy.

17:04.583 --> 17:06.291
Thanks.

17:06.375 --> 17:09.709
After we're all dead, you'll be
the only ones left to carry on.

17:11.333 --> 17:14.667
Gabrielle and I
are about to start a family.

17:15.542 --> 17:17.000
That's great.

17:17.083 --> 17:20.625
- When did you decide this?
- It's a fairly recent development.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.166
I see.

17:25.250 --> 17:29.000
- We'll talk about this later.
- Face it. We're shallow people.

17:29.083 --> 17:32.166
Can our lives have any meaning
if all we do is buy stuff?

17:32.250 --> 17:35.083
- That depends on what we buy.
- I want a child.

17:35.166 --> 17:38.625
In case you've forgotten,
we made a deal. No kids.

17:38.709 --> 17:43.291
- Deals were meant to be renegotiated.
- We're not negotiating my uterus.

17:43.375 --> 17:46.250
- We should probably be going.
- Yeah.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.542
Thank you so much.

17:49.750 --> 17:53.083
- That was weird.
- I feel awful for Carlos.

17:53.166 --> 17:57.041
That talk about children
is obviously coming from his grief.

17:57.125 --> 17:59.250
Whatever. I'm off the hook.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.959
<i>A weary Lynette drank her potent tea</i>

18:10.083 --> 18:14.125
<i>in hopes of finally finding the sleep</i>
<i>that had eluded her.</i>

18:14.291 --> 18:18.959
<i>Unfortunately for Lynette,</i>
<i>there would be no rest for the weary.</i>

18:20.834 --> 18:22.917
Go to hell.

18:34.709 --> 18:38.417
Sorry we're late. Kenny Lipman
couldn't find his neckerchief.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.333
Lori Jean, the Scout meeting is today?

18:47.500 --> 18:49.709
- Mummy.
- What? Right.

18:49.792 --> 18:53.500
OK. Boys.
This knot is called the bowline.

18:53.583 --> 18:57.291
It is a remarkably useful knot.
Now, pick up your ropes.

18:57.375 --> 19:00.125
First we cross this end over here

19:00.208 --> 19:03.834
and then we make a loop
and then another loop

19:03.917 --> 19:08.333
and then you sort of pull it through,
I'm guessing,

19:08.417 --> 19:11.291
and then you just... Ready?
...yank it taut.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.834
Mummy, that doesn't look like
the picture.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.959
You're never gonna be a sailor.
What do you care?

19:20.041 --> 19:22.709
OK, everybody. Let's just take a break.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.500
Thanks.

19:40.208 --> 19:43.542
OK. It's all up there.
Can I get a signature?

19:43.667 --> 19:46.333
- Of course.
- Thank you very much.

19:48.375 --> 19:51.208
- There you go. Have a nice weekend.
- You too, lady.

20:37.709 --> 20:42.875
Hey, ma'am. Are you still here?
I forgot to give you a receipt.

21:18.750 --> 21:22.875
I need help. I'm up here.
I'm trapped in the floor. Hello.

21:24.875 --> 21:28.125
If you came in here to judge me,
you can just leave.

21:29.291 --> 21:32.250
Wait, no. Don't go.

21:32.333 --> 21:35.500
I have an idea. Here.

21:35.583 --> 21:37.792
Grab the towel, Bongo.

21:37.875 --> 21:40.083
Come on. Grab the other end. Good boy.

21:40.166 --> 21:44.083
That's it. Get the other end.
Come on, Bongo. Pull the other end.

21:44.166 --> 21:47.792
Come on, Bongo. What are you doing?
Bongo, over here.

21:47.875 --> 21:52.166
Bongo? Don't do that.

21:54.166 --> 21:56.792
<i>While Susan remained hopelessly stuck,</i>

21:56.875 --> 21:59.291
<i>Gabrielle was moving</i>
<i>to confront the issue</i>

21:59.375 --> 22:01.792
<i>of her young lover's</i>
<i>restless conscience.</i>

22:01.875 --> 22:05.583
- Nobody's home.
- I know. I came to talk to you.

22:05.667 --> 22:09.750
<i>- But she would need to be discreet.</i>
- Keep working.

22:09.875 --> 22:12.709
What were you thinking
showing up at the hospital?

22:13.542 --> 22:17.542
- I had to see if she was OK.
- You need to keep a low profile.

22:18.917 --> 22:21.875
Look, you and I are finished.

22:21.959 --> 22:24.375
From now on, I'm sticking with Danielle.

22:24.458 --> 22:27.542
- Why would you say that?
- I hate myself for what we did.

22:27.625 --> 22:30.625
I can't sleep at night.
We've got to make a clean break.

22:30.709 --> 22:34.542
We weren't driving the car. We didn't
chase Juanita into the street.

22:34.667 --> 22:37.208
She was there because of our affair.

22:37.291 --> 22:42.000
Between you and Carlos. Listen to me.
You didn't do anything wrong.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.625
- That's not what Father Crowley thinks.
- What?

22:46.709 --> 22:49.375
I went to confession.

22:51.583 --> 22:55.375
Have you lost your mind?
What did you tell him?

22:55.458 --> 22:58.834
- Everything.
- Including...

22:58.917 --> 23:01.792
in the alley? Behind the truck stop?

23:01.875 --> 23:04.542
- Everything.
- Damn you.

23:14.083 --> 23:18.792
What is wrong with you? Lassie would
have had a fire truck here by now.

23:18.917 --> 23:21.458
You stupid dog.

23:21.542 --> 23:25.792
Good boy, Bongo. Run, Bongo, run.
Go get help.

23:39.125 --> 23:44.333
Andrew, I know the last few days
have been stressful

23:44.417 --> 23:47.375
and if you ever need
to talk to anybody...

23:47.458 --> 23:51.291
I know. You and Dad are here for me.

23:51.375 --> 23:54.458
I was thinking
you could talk to a professional.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.583
A shrink?

23:58.625 --> 24:01.125
- You think I'm crazy?
- Course not.

24:01.208 --> 24:04.709
It's just the accident probably
stirred up a lot of emotions.

24:04.792 --> 24:10.166
It would be normal for you to be feeling
confused or depressed or shamed.

24:11.166 --> 24:13.834
I'm cool. Really.

24:13.917 --> 24:18.375
You put a woman into a coma. Surely
that arouses some kind of emotion.

24:18.458 --> 24:21.208
Yeah, well, it doesn't.

24:24.417 --> 24:27.208
- If you'll excuse me.
- No. Not until you tell me.

24:27.333 --> 24:30.834
- Why do you care?
- I need to know you're not a monster.

24:32.542 --> 24:36.000
- You want to know how I feel?
- Yeah.

24:36.125 --> 24:38.250
I feel bad that she got hurt.

24:38.333 --> 24:40.583
But I also feel bad
that my car got dinged

24:40.667 --> 24:44.250
because somebody didn't have the sense
to look both ways.

24:44.333 --> 24:47.834
And I feel bad that now I'm gonna
have to ride my bike to school.

24:50.959 --> 24:54.041
Andrew, you almost killed
another human being.

24:54.166 --> 24:57.959
She's an old lady, OK?
She's lived her life.

24:58.041 --> 25:01.417
I have my whole life ahead of me.
Now it might be screwed up.

25:01.542 --> 25:06.458
- That's what you should worry about.
- You don't seem to have a soul.

25:08.875 --> 25:12.083
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't call the police.

25:12.166 --> 25:16.125
Because I'm your son.
That would make you the monster.

25:29.542 --> 25:31.375
Hey, buddy.

25:39.709 --> 25:44.041
- Susan, is that you?
- Mike? I'm upstairs. Sorta.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.583
Hang on. I'll be right up.

25:55.750 --> 26:02.000
- What happened?
- This bird flew in your bathroom window

26:02.083 --> 26:06.834
and I tried to save it but it died.

26:06.917 --> 26:10.500
- I don't think that's what happened.
- I don't think so either.

26:11.834 --> 26:14.291
- Come here.
- Help me get out of here please.

26:20.208 --> 26:21.709
Thank you.

26:23.625 --> 26:26.208
You have no idea what that was like.

26:29.291 --> 26:32.959
- You went through my cabinets?
- What?

26:33.041 --> 26:36.458
- I can explain that.
- Get out of my house.

26:36.542 --> 26:40.792
- Mike...
- Get out.

27:10.834 --> 27:13.041
- Hello there.
- Good afternoon.

27:15.250 --> 27:19.000
Well, isn't this
just as pretty as a picture book?

27:19.083 --> 27:22.917
The plan is to put in a small condo.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.041
You want to make some money
or pussyfoot around?

27:26.125 --> 27:29.917
- What do you suggest?
- I'm thinking strip mall.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.542
I've run some numbers.

27:37.417 --> 27:40.375
- Nice stationery.
- It's stolen.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.709
What do you mean?

27:44.792 --> 27:48.125
After my house burned down,
I was staying with Martha Huber.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.583
That is until
the old troll threw me out.

27:50.667 --> 27:54.458
I'd steal her stuff, she'd steal mine.
It's the circle of life.

27:55.667 --> 27:58.375
So this paper is hers?

27:58.458 --> 28:00.375
Oh, God, yes.

28:11.875 --> 28:14.959
No, Tom, you can't do this to me.

28:15.041 --> 28:18.917
I need you home.
Boys, stop it. I am on the phone.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.875
I realize it's not your fault
that the meeting got postponed

28:23.959 --> 28:26.583
but you promised you'd be back tonight.

28:26.667 --> 28:29.542
- Mum.
- I gotta go.

28:29.625 --> 28:32.417
The kids are... Yeah.

28:32.500 --> 28:36.875
I know you're sorry. Will you try
and get back as soon as you can?

28:39.291 --> 28:43.083
Boys, would you please, please stop it?

28:44.291 --> 28:48.208
Really. Mummy's got a headache, OK?
Just...

28:52.166 --> 28:55.125
Turn that damn thing off.

28:55.250 --> 28:59.333
What's the matter with you?
Why won't you listen to me?

30:07.959 --> 30:09.291
What?

30:09.375 --> 30:12.333
I just came over to say I'm sorry.

30:12.458 --> 30:14.500
And I'll pay for all the damage.

30:14.583 --> 30:16.709
Don't worry about it.

30:16.834 --> 30:19.166
Well... So...

30:19.250 --> 30:21.792
In your mind, is the date off?

30:21.875 --> 30:24.875
You snooped around my house
and went through my stuff.

30:24.959 --> 30:27.375
Yeah. That's pretty much a deal breaker.

30:27.458 --> 30:32.417
I started snooping around because
I found all that money by accident.

30:32.500 --> 30:35.875
Then I found a gun.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.667
- Are you a drug dealer?
- Is that what you think?

30:38.750 --> 30:43.000
I wouldn't know because you never
let me in. You're completely walled off.

30:43.083 --> 30:46.083
I have a gun for protection
and cash for emergencies.

30:46.166 --> 30:48.875
I'm a good guy,
and you should know that.

30:48.959 --> 30:51.667
I'm not obligated
to share every detail...

30:51.750 --> 30:55.250
Every detail is one thing,
weird secrets is another.

30:55.333 --> 30:58.208
- You don't trust me.
- Maybe we shouldn't be dating.

30:58.291 --> 31:00.375
Maybe we shouldn't.

31:00.500 --> 31:03.792
- Do you mean that?
- Yeah.

31:03.875 --> 31:07.375
I hope your little secret
keeps you warm at night

31:07.458 --> 31:11.500
because you're throwing something
really great away to protect it.

31:22.458 --> 31:26.083
- You gotta take my kids for a while.
- This really isn't a good time.

31:26.166 --> 31:31.250
Sorry, I can't do this. It's too much.
Boys, you stay with your Aunt Susan.

31:33.291 --> 31:36.458
Lynette, when are you coming back?

32:00.000 --> 32:01.834
She's gotta be close.

32:01.959 --> 32:04.417
I hope the kids
aren't too much for Danielle.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.792
She'll be fine. What do you think
is happening with Lynette?

32:07.875 --> 32:11.291
I don't know. But I'm scared.
Something's very wrong.

32:25.709 --> 32:27.750
Lynette? Honey?

32:27.834 --> 32:30.291
Are you OK?

32:35.500 --> 32:39.125
Father. I'm so glad you could come
and pray for Mama.

32:39.208 --> 32:42.041
- Please, sit.
- Thank you, Gabrielle.

32:50.417 --> 32:54.291
Since you're here. There's something
I've always wondered about.

32:54.417 --> 32:57.208
That whole thing about priests

32:57.333 --> 33:00.625
not being allowed to repeat
what they hear in confessions.

33:00.709 --> 33:04.125
Is that a hard rule
or just a general guideline?

33:04.250 --> 33:06.834
Rest assured,
everyone's secrets are safe.

33:06.917 --> 33:09.250
That's good to hear.

33:09.333 --> 33:12.041
I'll keep yours too if you want to talk.

33:12.125 --> 33:16.750
Me? No.
Confession's not really my thing.

33:16.834 --> 33:18.959
That's a shame.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.709
You can stop condemning me
with your eyes.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.959
Right now.

33:31.792 --> 33:34.542
I know you know about the affair.

33:34.625 --> 33:36.875
But you know nothing about my life.

33:38.875 --> 33:41.875
It's not even an issue any more.
John and I are finished.

33:41.959 --> 33:44.125
Gabrielle, the Church is clear on this.

33:44.208 --> 33:47.792
If you commit a mortal sin
and you die without repenting,

33:47.875 --> 33:49.625
you go to hell.

33:49.709 --> 33:52.000
Well, aren't you just a ball of fun?

33:56.208 --> 33:59.959
So if I confess,
it'll clean the slate, right?

34:00.041 --> 34:04.208
Not only that. If you want God's
forgiveness you have to be truly sorry

34:04.291 --> 34:06.834
and promise not to commit the sin again.

34:06.917 --> 34:10.792
So what happens if I repent later?

34:10.875 --> 34:12.917
Like, say, when I'm 75?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.875
What if you die before then?

34:15.959 --> 34:19.834
Let's say I don't die?
I do yoga. I eat well.

34:19.917 --> 34:22.750
If I wait,
does my repenting still count?

34:22.834 --> 34:24.709
If you mean it, yes.

34:25.667 --> 34:29.917
Thank you, Father Crowley.
You have been a tremendous comfort.

34:32.250 --> 34:34.291
I will let you do your thing.

34:34.375 --> 34:37.166
Gabrielle.

34:37.250 --> 34:40.125
We're all responsible
for the choices we make.

34:41.375 --> 34:46.208
- Don't you want to be a good person?
- What I want is to be happy.

34:46.291 --> 34:48.834
That's the answer of a selfish child.

34:50.333 --> 34:52.959
I know.

34:58.291 --> 35:01.542
I started taking the pills
because they gave me energy

35:01.625 --> 35:06.458
but then I couldn't sleep at night
and I was so tired in the daytime and...

35:07.542 --> 35:10.250
It totally messed me up.

35:13.125 --> 35:17.834
I love my kids so much.
I'm so sorry they have me as a mother.

35:17.959 --> 35:21.208
Lynette, you're a great mother.

35:21.291 --> 35:23.625
No, I'm not.

35:23.709 --> 35:25.667
I can't do it.

35:25.750 --> 35:29.583
I'm so tired of feeling like a failure.
It's so humiliating.

35:29.709 --> 35:32.417
No, it's not.

35:32.500 --> 35:37.000
So you got addicted to your kids'
ADD medication. It happens.

35:37.083 --> 35:40.625
You've got four kids. That's a lot
of stress. You just need help.

35:40.709 --> 35:45.291
That's what so humiliating.
Other mums don't need help.

35:45.417 --> 35:49.625
Other mums make it look so easy.
All I do is complain.

35:49.709 --> 35:51.417
That's just not true.

35:51.500 --> 35:55.500
When Julie was a baby,
I was out of my mind almost every day.

35:55.583 --> 35:58.542
I got so upset
when Andrew and Danielle were little,

35:58.667 --> 36:00.834
I used their nap times to cry.

36:04.125 --> 36:07.709
Why didn't you ever tell me this?

36:07.792 --> 36:12.834
Baby. Nobody likes to admit
that they can't handle the pressure.

36:12.917 --> 36:18.750
I think it's just like we think, you
know, it's easier to keep it all in.

36:18.834 --> 36:24.000
We shouldn't.
We should tell each other this stuff.

36:26.208 --> 36:28.750
- It helps?
- Yeah.

36:28.875 --> 36:31.542
It really does.

36:44.166 --> 36:46.458
So it was Martha Huber all along.

36:46.542 --> 36:51.250
Seems so. Edie didn't move in with Huber
until after your wife received the note.

36:51.333 --> 36:54.083
My God,
we almost killed an innocent woman.

36:54.166 --> 36:56.792
Like I said, I don't do refunds,

36:56.875 --> 36:59.917
but if you like,
I'm willing to pay Mrs. Huber a visit.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.917
No. Just keep the money.

37:03.041 --> 37:08.125
This whole thing's been tearing me up.
The nightmares, the guilt.

37:08.208 --> 37:10.792
This isn't what Mary Alice
would have wanted.

37:10.917 --> 37:13.583
What would she have wanted?

37:16.083 --> 37:18.125
Answers.

37:22.542 --> 37:25.166
- Hello, Mrs. Huber.
- Paul.

37:25.250 --> 37:27.333
- Let me help.
- That's not necessary.

37:27.417 --> 37:29.291
I insist.

38:33.375 --> 38:35.166
- Ants?
- Yes.

38:35.250 --> 38:37.542
I've had a little infestation problem.

38:37.667 --> 38:40.041
I wanted to take care of it
before my trip.

38:40.166 --> 38:42.917
Never had a problem with ants.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.875
Mary Alice and I had
these little black flies once.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.875
She was so funny about it.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.542
She ran out and bought herself a can
of poison something to spray them down.

38:53.625 --> 38:57.583
So she's taking aim at one
on the counter and she just stops.

38:57.667 --> 39:00.959
Puts the can down. Couldn't do it.

39:01.041 --> 39:04.375
She told me later it felt too personal.

39:04.500 --> 39:07.959
Literally couldn't kill a fly.
That's how gentle she was.

39:08.041 --> 39:10.625
Then you must have lived with
quite a few flies.

39:10.709 --> 39:13.542
I'm going to have to say
good night to you now, Paul.

39:22.959 --> 39:26.291
- What are you doing here?
- I want to know why.

39:39.583 --> 39:43.417
I know you've got a lot of questions
and I know I don't want to lose you.

39:43.542 --> 39:46.250
So ask me anything you want.

39:46.333 --> 39:49.500
You just told me
everything I need to know.

39:56.959 --> 40:03.000
All right. My idiot husband died
and left me with a worthless pension.

40:03.083 --> 40:04.959
I was desperate for money.

40:05.083 --> 40:07.875
I'd rather take it from a bad person
than a good one.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.417
- I didn't know she'd shoot herself.
- She was a good person.

40:11.542 --> 40:14.291
A good person
who leaves her child motherless?

40:14.375 --> 40:16.834
Read the Bible. Suicide's a big no-no.

40:16.917 --> 40:19.875
- Don't you feel any remorse?
- Why should I?

40:20.000 --> 40:22.917
Your wife didn't kill herself
because I wrote a note.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.333
She killed herself because
of what she did to that poor baby.

40:27.417 --> 40:31.875
But rest assured
I'm praying for Mary Alice.

40:31.959 --> 40:35.250
After what she did,
she'll need all of our prayers.

41:24.208 --> 41:28.542
<i>There is a widely-read book</i>
<i>that tells us everyone is a sinner.</i>

41:32.291 --> 41:38.333
<i>Of course, not everyone feels guilt</i>
<i>over the bad things they do.</i>

41:39.333 --> 41:44.083
<i>In contrast, there are those who assume</i>
<i>more than their share of the blame.</i>

41:48.750 --> 41:52.417
<i>There are others</i>
<i>who soothe their consciences</i>

41:52.500 --> 41:55.625
<i>with small acts of kindness.</i>

42:02.000 --> 42:06.125
<i>Or by telling themselves</i>
<i>their sins were justified.</i>

42:09.875 --> 42:14.500
<i>Finally, there are the ones</i>
<i>who simply vow to do better next time,</i>

42:14.583 --> 42:17.083
<i>and pray for forgiveness.</i>

42:29.250 --> 42:32.875
<i>Sometimes, their prayers are answered.</i>
