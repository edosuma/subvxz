WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:05.831
[Harry]
'Hello, my name is Harry,
and I'm an overeater.'

00:05.918 --> 00:07.529
[in unison]
'Hi, Harry.'

00:07.616 --> 00:11.141
Well, I had an extraordinary
week and shed yet another pound

00:11.228 --> 00:13.448
which brings a
grand total for the year

00:13.535 --> 00:16.625
to a hard fought
and well earned seven.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.628
Thank you.

00:19.715 --> 00:22.631
One lousy pound and he's
acting like he won an Oscar.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.720
Well, buckle up, buddy,
cause I've lost three

00:24.807 --> 00:26.330
and I'm going
full-on Sally Field.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.551
'Anyway, Thanksgiving
is upon us'

00:29.638 --> 00:32.597
and with my newfound
strength, I do not fear it.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.338
Bring on your
Turkey and stuffing

00:34.425 --> 00:36.993
your mashed potatoes,
and mouth-watering gravy

00:37.080 --> 00:39.996
'your buttery Crescent rolls
and pumpkin pie slathered'

00:40.083 --> 00:41.302
'in pillowy
clouds of whipped cream.'

00:41.389 --> 00:44.261
Wrap it up, Gary.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.394
'Course that won't be
a problem for me this year

00:46.481 --> 00:48.918
because my mother's
going to my brother's house

00:49.005 --> 00:51.964
so my Thanksgiving
will be a holiday lean cuisine

00:52.052 --> 00:54.967
flavored by my salty tears.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.969
We should invite
him to our house.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.928
You heard him,
he's already got plans.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.019
Thank you, Harry.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.977
I have the in-laws
at my place, otherwise..

01:05.065 --> 01:07.023
Save it!

01:07.110 --> 01:08.851
Alright. Well,
we have time for one more.

01:08.938 --> 01:11.680
Oh, that's me.

01:11.767 --> 01:14.596
So, you probably got a full
house at your place, huh?

01:14.683 --> 01:17.381
Uh, unfortunately.
Molly's family, my mother.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.731
Boy, I'd trade places
with you in a heartbeat.

01:19.818 --> 01:22.169
Well, if you think it'd be
okay with Molly, I'm game.

01:23.692 --> 01:25.563
Hi, my name is Molly,
and I'm an overeater.

01:25.650 --> 01:27.391
[in unison]
'Hi, Molly.'

01:27.478 --> 01:29.654
Don't you hate it when people
come up here and they, you know

01:29.741 --> 01:31.047
tell you they've
lost a bunch of weight

01:31.134 --> 01:32.788
and they had an amazing week?

01:32.875 --> 01:36.531
Well, let the hating begin
because this gal has lost

01:36.618 --> 01:41.492
not one, not two,
but three pounds.

01:41.579 --> 01:44.365
If you wanna throw something at
me, fruit and vegetables only.

01:57.682 --> 02:01.817
- Mike, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

02:01.904 --> 02:03.297
I smell nougat.

02:04.689 --> 02:05.908
Keep your voice down.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.692
No big deal.
It's just one candy bar.

02:07.779 --> 02:10.130
Well, there's no such thing
as just "One" candy bar.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.175
One is too many
and a thousand is not enough.

02:12.262 --> 02:13.829
Come on, a thousand
could last a guy

02:13.916 --> 02:16.527
at least a couple of weeks.

02:16.614 --> 02:18.138
Listen, you've got a problem

02:18.225 --> 02:20.052
and I'm volunteering
to be your sponsor.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.839
Hitch your wagon of weakness
to my tow truck of willpower.

02:23.926 --> 02:26.189
Right. Nobody needs
to know about this

02:26.276 --> 02:27.799
especially Molly,
besides, I'll be fine.

02:27.886 --> 02:28.887
No, you won't.

02:28.974 --> 02:30.367
Thanksgiving is coming up

02:30.454 --> 02:32.674
and you need somebody
right by your side.

02:32.761 --> 02:35.894
Or across the table
or boy-girl, boy-girl.

02:35.981 --> 02:37.331
Whatever your seating plan is.

02:40.551 --> 02:42.858
Hey, why'd
you guys sneak out?

02:42.945 --> 02:44.468
I got this.

02:44.555 --> 02:46.470
Molly, your boyfriend
has a problem.

02:46.557 --> 02:49.778
Harry.

02:49.865 --> 02:53.216
He asked me to spend
Thanksgiving with you and yours

02:53.303 --> 02:55.392
and he didn't
clear it with you.

02:55.479 --> 02:57.177
Oh, of course,
you're more than welcome.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.656
Will it just be you?

02:58.743 --> 03:01.181
I don't know.
The bulimic in the front row was

03:01.268 --> 03:03.270
kinda giving daddy
the sweet knees.

03:07.143 --> 03:09.580
Just put him down for one.

03:09.667 --> 03:15.107
♪ For the first
time in my life ♪

03:15.195 --> 03:18.110
♪ I see love ♪♪

03:30.035 --> 03:31.428
One Denver omelet
with butter toasted

03:31.515 --> 03:33.082
hash browns, extra crispy,

03:33.169 --> 03:35.998
and one cup of herbal tea,
no honey, extra lemon.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.217
Thank you.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.178
What? I'm not hungry.

03:42.265 --> 03:44.311
Yeah, and I'm not black,
virile and handsome.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.271
Ditto.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.186
I had a piece
of toast at the house.

03:50.273 --> 03:52.449
Was it being used as a
coaster for a honeybaked ham?

03:54.364 --> 03:56.018
And you can't tell
me, you're not hungry.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.237
Your stomach's been
growling all morning.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.586
It sounded like a grizzly bear

03:58.673 --> 04:01.458
opening the door
to a haunted house.

04:01.545 --> 04:02.981
I'll keep a short
stack at the ready

04:03.068 --> 04:06.158
in case gentle Ben
comes out of hibernation.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.899
Hey, I'm just eating light

04:07.986 --> 04:09.901
so that on Thanksgiving I can
have a little extra stuffing

04:09.988 --> 04:11.599
and maybe some dessert.

04:11.686 --> 04:14.036
And there it is, the first
lie of the holiday season.

04:14.123 --> 04:16.256
God bless us, everyone.

04:16.343 --> 04:17.822
Let it go, okay?

04:17.909 --> 04:19.433
Fine, I'm not
gonna push it.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.999
Oh, by the way,
I'm bringing Christina

04:21.086 --> 04:22.349
with me and grandma
this year.

04:22.436 --> 04:23.654
A date at Thanksgiving?

04:23.741 --> 04:25.482
I thought you didn't
like to be "Hamstrung

04:25.569 --> 04:28.442
by the holiday hoochie."

04:28.529 --> 04:30.705
Well, I'm bending a lot of
rules for Christina.

04:30.792 --> 04:33.055
This is the woman I'm planning
on ringing in the new year with.

04:33.142 --> 04:35.057
Does she know that you wear
the sash and the diaper

04:35.144 --> 04:37.755
even when no one asks you to?

04:37.842 --> 04:40.845
She will when the clock
strikes midnight.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.369
Geez, I'm starving to death.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.501
I need more lemons. Samuel!

04:47.983 --> 04:49.289
What the hell was that?

04:49.376 --> 04:51.073
Sorry, I think
I had a loose button.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.988
Loose? It would've
fallen into your lap.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.164
That thing hit me in the head
like a Chinese throwing star.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.385
My shirt must have
shrunk in the dryer.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.474
Yeah, well, next time you
might wanna climb in with it.

05:12.790 --> 05:14.575
It's for your own good, Jim.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.098
You need to quit
chewing your ding-dong

05:16.185 --> 05:17.882
like it's got
peanut butter in it.

05:22.104 --> 05:23.975
Thanks for holding
onto these clothes, mom.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.803
Saves me from having
to buy new ones.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.979
Well, it didn't take
a magic eight ball

05:28.066 --> 05:30.199
to know you were gonna
put those pounds back on

05:30.286 --> 05:33.115
and come a-knocking
for your "Chubby duds."

05:33.202 --> 05:34.986
It's just temporary.

05:35.073 --> 05:37.380
I'll drop this weight before
Molly finds out about it.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.730
Is that why
you're starving yourself?

05:39.817 --> 05:43.778
So she can parade you around
in tank tops and skinny jeans?

05:43.865 --> 05:47.216
Mom, my "Skinny jeans"
have 12 belt loops

05:47.303 --> 05:51.481
and my tank tops
are "Tank tops."

05:51.568 --> 05:54.266
I, for one,
love you for who you are.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.834
Unlike your fiancee
who seems hell-bent

05:56.921 --> 06:00.403
on turning you into
a Chippendale dancer.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.100
Mom, people have
actually offered me money

06:02.187 --> 06:04.799
to keep my clothes on.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.540
And don't talk
about Molly that way.

06:06.627 --> 06:07.802
She only wants
what's best for me.

06:07.889 --> 06:10.195
Alright, don't bite my head off.

06:10.282 --> 06:11.806
Sounds to me like somebody's got

06:11.893 --> 06:14.939
a bad case of the
"hungry-grumblies."

06:15.026 --> 06:16.593
You'd be grumbly, too

06:16.680 --> 06:18.900
if you were living on
dry toast and lemon wedges.

06:18.987 --> 06:22.469
Oh, my God, that
awful woman is killing you.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.427
How 'bout mommy
makes you a nice bowl

06:24.514 --> 06:27.778
of macaroni and cheese while you
put on your big boy britches?

06:30.346 --> 06:33.828
Probably wouldn't hurt for me
to have a little something.

06:33.915 --> 06:35.830
I'll slice up
a few wienies in it.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.876
That way you're
getting your protein.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.356
Thanks, mom.

06:43.664 --> 06:46.406
Don't judge me.
I've seen you eat cat poop.

06:46.493 --> 06:47.798
[barks]

06:52.063 --> 06:54.588
You guys are gonna love
these mashed potatoes.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.154
It's a new recipe

06:56.241 --> 06:57.678
that I foundin
my healthy living cookbook.

06:57.765 --> 07:01.377
- Mmm.
- Alright, oop.

07:01.464 --> 07:02.770
- Amazing.
- Mmm!

07:02.857 --> 07:04.641
Sweetie,
these are delicious.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.861
And here's the kicker, they're
not really mashed potatoes.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.732
They're pureed cauliflower.

07:08.819 --> 07:10.212
- Yech.
- Blech.

07:10.299 --> 07:12.257
Oh, come on!
A second ago you loved it.

07:12.344 --> 07:15.347
A second ago
it was potatoes.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.524
You tricked us.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.134
I don't like that.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.878
Sorry I'm late, my mom needed
me to unclog her disposal

07:23.965 --> 07:25.793
and the thing blew
coffee grounds all over me

07:25.880 --> 07:28.926
which is why I'm wearing this
shirt you've never seen before.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.798
Well, dinner's almost ready.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.495
Actually, I'm not hungry.
I had a late lunch.

07:32.582 --> 07:35.585
A late, light, sensible lunch.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.761
Not hungry,
I've heard him say "not"

07:37.848 --> 07:38.936
and I've heard
him say "hungry"

07:39.023 --> 07:41.678
never the two together.

07:41.765 --> 07:45.247
You don't think he's getting
"fed" somewhere else, do you?

07:45.334 --> 07:47.292
Like that big ol' Maine coon
cat we used to have.

07:47.379 --> 07:48.903
Buster!

07:48.990 --> 07:51.906
He'd come home late and walk
right past his food dish.

07:51.993 --> 07:54.691
That's right, the divorcee
up the street was

07:54.778 --> 07:57.085
giving him fancy feast,
rubbing his belly

07:57.172 --> 07:59.043
and calling him "Rodney."

07:59.130 --> 08:00.218
I don't think..

08:00.305 --> 08:02.917
And she wasn't the only one.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.484
We had to tie a little
bell around his neck

08:04.571 --> 08:06.181
so we'd know
where he was.

08:06.268 --> 08:09.706
And he'd always come home
just to sleep and go potty.

08:09.793 --> 08:10.838
That's how I knew

08:10.925 --> 08:12.666
he was eating
three dinners a day.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.190
His litter box started
looking like an ashtray

08:15.277 --> 08:16.887
at a Cuban card game.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.502
Harry, you gotta help me.

08:22.589 --> 08:25.026
I just ate two bowls of
Mac and cheese at my mom's.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.767
What does it matter if
it's the packaged kind?

08:26.854 --> 08:28.420
What matters is I ate
it right out of the pot

08:28.508 --> 08:30.901
with my bare hands.

08:30.988 --> 08:33.382
Mike? Oh.

08:33.469 --> 08:34.818
Who you talking to?

08:34.905 --> 08:37.038
Nobody, just, uh,
checking my voicemail

08:37.125 --> 08:38.996
seeing if anybody called.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.041
How are you?

08:40.128 --> 08:42.609
I'm good.
Everything okay?

08:42.696 --> 08:44.959
Yep. Never better.

08:45.046 --> 08:46.917
[mobile ringing]

08:54.490 --> 08:56.623
Are ya gonna answer that?

08:56.710 --> 08:59.539
Yes, I am.
I just didn't want to be rude.

09:01.018 --> 09:03.455
Hello.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.545
Hey, Harry, what's up, my man?

09:05.632 --> 09:07.634
Oh, no! That's horrible.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.331
I'll be right over.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.159
Apparently, he's crawled
into a bag of Oreos

09:11.246 --> 09:13.857
and he's trying
to eat his way out.

09:13.944 --> 09:17.078
I'm surprised he got
reception in there.

09:17.165 --> 09:20.037
Oreos, the double
stuffed train to hell.

09:23.954 --> 09:26.043
I may actually have to put
a bell around his neck.

09:30.047 --> 09:32.397
Listen, you don't have to
worry about Molly finding out.

09:32.484 --> 09:33.747
This is a men's only group.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.096
Harry, I'm not
ready to share.

09:35.183 --> 09:37.751
I'm still burping up
wienies and cheese.

09:37.838 --> 09:41.450
Oh, man,
do I miss those burps.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.757
But we've got to get you
back on the road to recovery.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.541
Alright, let's do this thing.

09:45.628 --> 09:46.629
Just remember,
the first step is

09:46.716 --> 09:47.891
to be honest
with yourself

09:47.978 --> 09:51.068
so you can be honest
with everybody else.

09:51.155 --> 09:52.417
And it's even
more challenging

09:52.504 --> 09:54.332
being a gay man
with weight issues.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.944
By the way, my name
is Kevin, you're Ronaldo

09:57.031 --> 09:58.423
and we're very much in love.

10:11.001 --> 10:13.351
Our primary purpose is to
abstain from compulsive

10:13.438 --> 10:16.267
'overeating and to carry
this message of recovery'

10:16.354 --> 10:17.834
'to those who still suffer.'

10:17.921 --> 10:19.880
Harry, I'm gonna be fine.
Let's just get out of here.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.099
All you have to do is stand up

10:22.186 --> 10:25.668
pretend to be gay and admit
that you're powerless over food

10:25.755 --> 10:27.627
and my beautiful brown eyes.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.673
Fine, I'll go first.

10:33.371 --> 10:35.373
You have
a very commanding presence.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.727
Hello, my name is Kevin
and I'm an overeater.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.250
[in unison]
'Hi, Kevin.'

10:42.337 --> 10:44.905
Well, things are going
really super for me.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.342
Ronaldo and I are very happy

10:47.429 --> 10:49.605
and gay.

10:49.692 --> 10:50.780
'We both have weight issues'

10:50.867 --> 10:52.303
'and occasionally we stumble'

10:52.390 --> 10:53.783
but there is no judgment.

10:53.870 --> 10:56.656
Our relationship
is based on honesty.

10:56.743 --> 10:59.484
It is the glue that
holds us together.

10:59.571 --> 11:02.183
That and our
adopted African son, Chadwick.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.276
I didn't want kids

11:08.363 --> 11:10.408
but Kevin up there
really wanted to be a mommy.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.678
I apologize for
bringing up Chadwick

11:18.765 --> 11:20.331
but I had to make it believable

11:20.418 --> 11:23.683
because of my
palpable hetero vibe.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.815
Fine, and I'm sorry
I didn't share tonight

11:25.902 --> 11:27.774
but I'll be back on my diet
first thing in the morning.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.561
Why are you pulling
into a drive-thru?

11:32.648 --> 11:34.432
I'm gonna grab a diet coke.
You want anything?

11:34.519 --> 11:35.999
No, I don't and
neither do you.

11:36.086 --> 11:38.001
I'm just getting
something to drink.

11:38.088 --> 11:41.962
Oh, the siren smell of fries.
It's like a salty whorehouse.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.528
Could I get
a diet coke, please?

11:43.615 --> 11:44.921
You sure you
don't want anything?

11:45.008 --> 11:46.749
No, Mike, please
get us out of this

11:46.836 --> 11:49.665
godforsaken island
of temptation.

11:49.752 --> 11:52.015
Are those chicken tenders
made with white meat?

11:52.102 --> 11:53.974
Slippery slope!
Slippery slope!

11:54.061 --> 11:55.540
You know what, strike that.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.064
How about a grilled
chicken sandwich

11:57.151 --> 11:59.762
and a small order of fries?

11:59.849 --> 12:03.723
- Do not give this man food!
- Stop it.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.073
No chicken sandwich,
no coke, no fries!

12:06.160 --> 12:07.814
[male #1]
'One chicken sandwich,
one coke, one fries.'

12:07.901 --> 12:11.034
- No!
- It's out of my hands.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.602
I will not be party to this.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.909
On second thought,
forget the chicken sandwich.

12:15.996 --> 12:18.041
I'll have a double
bacon cheeseburger.

12:22.263 --> 12:24.613
You shall not pass!

12:24.700 --> 12:26.006
[male #1]
'Pay at the
first window, please.'

12:29.270 --> 12:31.751
I don't think I want
to be your sponsor anymore.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.976
So what time did Mike
finally get home last night?

12:40.063 --> 12:41.064
I don't know, it was late

12:41.151 --> 12:42.631
and I was already asleep.

12:42.718 --> 12:46.548
Just snuck in, huh?
That's what Buster would do.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.550
Okay, stop it.

12:48.637 --> 12:51.727
Mike's not a cat.
He's also not cheating on me.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.642
He is, however,
cheating on his diet

12:53.729 --> 12:55.035
and he's trying
to hide it from me.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.776
That explains
why I've been finding

12:56.863 --> 12:59.430
candy wrappers
in my bird feeder.

12:59.517 --> 13:01.171
Oh, no, it's gotten that bad?

13:01.258 --> 13:02.825
Well, it's either him

13:02.912 --> 13:05.088
or the finches are feeding
their babies milk duds.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.527
And I didn't want to say
anything, but my munchie drawer

13:09.614 --> 13:12.356
has definitely been compromised.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.402
Victoria, are you
sure it was Mike?

13:14.489 --> 13:16.665
Pretty sure,
my Cheetos were gone

13:16.752 --> 13:18.232
and the TV remote was orange

13:18.319 --> 13:20.016
and tasted like cheese.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.415
You know, I was
very instrumental

13:27.502 --> 13:29.112
in getting Mike
and Molly together.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.114
I didn't realize you were
such a romantic, Carl.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.551
Oh yes, I may have
a tough, rugged exterior

13:33.638 --> 13:35.075
but inside I'm like
two baby ducks

13:35.162 --> 13:37.642
giving each other
butterfly kisses.

13:37.729 --> 13:40.036
Ring the bell, fool.

13:40.123 --> 13:43.300
This pie is hot and
my behind is cold.

13:43.387 --> 13:44.649
When he starts
rambling on like that

13:44.736 --> 13:45.912
just sing a song in your head.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.000
That's what I do.

13:48.131 --> 13:49.741
[doorbell rings]

13:49.829 --> 13:52.353
Don't worry,
Vince, I'll get it.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.354
How long till we eat?

13:53.441 --> 13:55.051
Well, if you hopped in the oven

13:55.138 --> 13:58.141
with an apple in your mouth,
I'd say four hours.

13:58.228 --> 14:01.057
- Hey, happy Thanksgiving.
- Hi! Happy Thanksgiving.

14:01.144 --> 14:02.842
Molly, I'd like you to meet
my special lady, Christina.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.234
Christina, this is Molly.

14:04.321 --> 14:05.322
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

14:05.409 --> 14:06.628
Nice to meet you, too.

14:06.715 --> 14:08.325
- Hi, Nana.
- Hey, sweetie.

14:08.412 --> 14:09.761
Where's Mike?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.068
Oh, he's been
upstairs all morning.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.984
Oh, yeah, the diet thing.
You want me to talk to him?

14:15.071 --> 14:17.639
Would you? I-I don't
think he's ready to talk to me.

14:17.726 --> 14:20.076
Oh, yeah, it'll be fine.
I'll be right back.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.252
And if that old woman starts
to tell Christina the story

14:22.339 --> 14:24.254
about me and the
blind girl at Bible camp

14:24.341 --> 14:26.300
knock the drink out her
hand and come get me.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.345
Will do.

14:28.432 --> 14:29.956
Right after I hear the story.

14:36.571 --> 14:39.356
Oh, no, Hawaiian
shirt and sweatpants.

14:39.443 --> 14:42.359
Why don't you just put on
a muumuu and be done with it?

14:42.446 --> 14:44.057
It's not a big deal.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.449
It's supposed to be
a casual gathering.

14:45.536 --> 14:46.842
Yeah, but we ain't
playing ukuleles

14:46.929 --> 14:49.192
and juggling fire sticks.

14:49.279 --> 14:50.846
Alright, I may have put
on a couple of pounds

14:50.933 --> 14:53.414
but trust me, Friday morning
I'm back in the saddle.

14:53.501 --> 14:54.894
The way you're going,
by Friday morning

14:54.981 --> 14:56.765
you're gonna be
wearing a saddle.

14:56.852 --> 14:58.158
Carl, please don't tell Molly.

14:58.245 --> 14:59.986
She lost three pounds
last week and all I lost

15:00.073 --> 15:03.424
was a Nutter Butter
I dropped in the shower.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.121
Eating in the shower again?

15:05.208 --> 15:06.818
But I thought things
were going so good.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.864
I've never been
happier in my life.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.735
And because of that

15:10.822 --> 15:12.781
I think I may have let
my guard down a little.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.783
So you put on a few pounds
and that made you feel guilty

15:14.870 --> 15:16.393
which caused you to eat more.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.309
Exactly, next thing you
know, I'm hiding snack cakes

15:19.396 --> 15:23.096
in my gym shoes and
dressing like Don Hobo.

15:23.183 --> 15:26.012
Wait, you actually went out
and bought gym shoes?

15:26.099 --> 15:30.190
Hey, that's good cardio
and enough itself.

15:30.277 --> 15:31.278
Carl, Bible camp.

15:31.365 --> 15:34.716
Gotta go.

15:34.803 --> 15:35.935
Hey, nice outfit.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.241
You wanna borrow my coconut bra?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.331
There's something
I need to tell you.

15:41.418 --> 15:42.506
Have a seat.

15:44.639 --> 15:46.119
Hope you're not
seeing another woman

15:46.206 --> 15:49.426
because we don't have
any more chairs downstairs.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.341
I'm not having an affair.

15:51.428 --> 15:55.606
But I have been sneaking around
and hiding something from you.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.175
You've fallen off your diet.

15:59.262 --> 16:01.612
- You know?
- Of course I know.

16:01.699 --> 16:04.441
I spend every day with you.
I sleep with you.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.313
I put my
arms around you.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.315
And you figured out your arms
aren't getting any shorter?

16:08.402 --> 16:10.360
No.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.623
I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.625
Mike, the only thing that
disappointed me was that you

16:14.712 --> 16:17.585
you didn't feel that you
could come talk to me about it.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.413
Oh, I didn't want you
to think I was weak.

16:19.500 --> 16:20.936
And especially since
you're doing so good.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.764
Yeah, for now.

16:22.851 --> 16:25.680
But just last month I ate a
whole bag of my sister's Cheetos

16:25.767 --> 16:27.638
while I was watching
the Chicago marathon.

16:31.381 --> 16:34.254
She really needs to put
a lock on that munchie drawer.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.212
She really needs
to quit smoking pot.

16:39.389 --> 16:43.089
You know, one of the perks of
this whole relationship thing

16:43.176 --> 16:47.180
is that you get to tell
the other person everything.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.660
- You wanna hear the best part?
- What?

16:49.747 --> 16:51.619
They never stop
loving you.

17:01.977 --> 17:04.371
Listen, everyone, Mike and I are
gonna go out for a little while.

17:04.458 --> 17:05.807
Just enjoy yourselves.

17:05.894 --> 17:08.766
When the oven dings,
take the Turkey out.

17:08.853 --> 17:11.291
Based on this group, that's
probably gonna fall on you.

17:11.378 --> 17:12.857
Got it.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.685
And don't worry about
saving anything for me.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.818
I've been a little
remiss in my diet.

17:16.905 --> 17:19.777
Oh, and Harry, the secret's out.
I told her everything.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.953
Did you tell her about
our baby Chadwick

17:22.041 --> 17:23.520
and the room full of gay men?

17:27.220 --> 17:28.656
- I'll explain it in the car.
- Oh.

17:30.484 --> 17:32.094
Where are you two going?

17:32.181 --> 17:33.400
We're going
to an OA meeting.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.097
It's Thanksgiving.

17:35.184 --> 17:36.359
Yeah, well,
I've been celebrating

17:36.446 --> 17:37.926
the holiday for a while now.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.493
Hey, you want to take some
banana pudding

17:39.580 --> 17:42.235
for the drive over?

17:42.322 --> 17:43.714
Wow. Really?

17:45.499 --> 17:47.022
No thanks, mom,
you're gonna have to

17:47.109 --> 17:49.068
figure out a different way
to show me your love.

17:52.245 --> 17:54.334
How the hell am I
supposed to do that?

17:57.554 --> 17:59.817
Alright, I took the cone off.
No chewing your ass.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.917
- You okay?
- A little shaky.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.224
Right here with you, pal.

18:15.311 --> 18:17.270
Alright, does anyone
else want to share?

18:30.283 --> 18:33.590
Hi, my name's Mike
and I'm an overeater.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.070
[all]
Hi, Mike.

18:42.904 --> 18:45.385
[theme music]
