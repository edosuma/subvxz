18:48.813 --> 18:51.805
Open fire! All weapons!

18:56.520 --> 18:57.544
Our turn.

19:00.758 --> 19:02.089
[GRUNTING]

19:05.696 --> 19:08.324
Think I'm getting the hang of this. Pull!

19:17.441 --> 19:18.669
Now, that's Ugly.

19:22.513 --> 19:23.707
[GRUNTING]

19:30.855 --> 19:31.879
Desaad.

19:34.792 --> 19:39.752
All will suffer. All will suffer!

19:45.002 --> 19:46.367
[YELLING]

19:48.606 --> 19:50.597
[ALL GROAN]

19:56.614 --> 19:57.979
She's hurt.

19:58.382 --> 20:02.478
The damage may be beyond repair,
but Motherbox will try.

20:13.364 --> 20:17.630
The healing process has begun
and will be completed on New Genesis.

20:18.469 --> 20:21.961
- Sorry, what?
- We thank you for your help, Superboy.

20:22.139 --> 20:24.130
But we must take
the Newgenisphere home now.

20:24.308 --> 20:27.800
- No. No way.
- Why should we leave her with you?

20:27.978 --> 20:31.311
To us, she lives.
To you, she's merely technology.

20:31.482 --> 20:33.950
- No, it's not like that!
- Then what is it like?

20:34.118 --> 20:36.279
We bonded, okay?

20:40.257 --> 20:44.717
In fact, it is. You may keep her.

20:47.765 --> 20:50.666
J'ONN J'ONZZ:
What exactly do you expect to find, Batman?

20:50.834 --> 20:54.167
According to Conner,
Sphere has proven quite useful.

20:54.672 --> 20:58.130
Wally has already rechristened
her the Super-Cycle.

20:58.309 --> 21:01.335
By any name,
the Sphere merits further investigation.

21:01.512 --> 21:04.242
As does everything in Superboy's report.

21:04.415 --> 21:06.349
Speaking of, where is he now?

21:07.218 --> 21:10.813
Here's the ugly truth.
I wasn't devastated.

21:10.988 --> 21:14.788
Even with Superman, Tornado, you,
the whole league dead.

21:15.292 --> 21:19.456
Even though I didn't save Wolf,
watched Artemis and Kaldur die...

21:19.630 --> 21:24.795
...and abandoned M'gann, I felt at peace.

21:27.104 --> 21:30.096
See, from the moment I first
opened my eyes in that Cadmus pod...

21:30.274 --> 21:33.573
...there's been one thing
I've wanted and feared:

21:33.744 --> 21:38.579
To know what it is to be Superman.
And I knew.

21:38.749 --> 21:42.685
So I was happy.

21:43.287 --> 21:47.724
Everyone I care about dead or traumatized,
and I'm happy.

21:47.891 --> 21:52.260
How do I get past the guilt of that?
How do I live with myself?

21:55.099 --> 21:57.727
BLACK CANARY:
I don't have any easy answers, Conner.

21:58.235 --> 22:00.362
But one thing's clear:

22:00.537 --> 22:03.233
Admitting it is the first step.

22:39.310 --> 22:41.301
