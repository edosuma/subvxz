00:50.759 --> 00:55.221
Clover, does Maurice seem sadder
than usual?

00:55.305 --> 00:56.723
Define "usual."

00:56.806 --> 01:00.185
I wonder if it's because
of the conversation we had yesterday.

01:00.268 --> 01:01.102
Hmm.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.437
-Oh!

01:02.520 --> 01:04.898
You are my advisor,

01:04.981 --> 01:06.900
but did you really think

01:06.983 --> 01:11.196
I would actually take any of your advice?

01:11.279 --> 01:14.074
Oh, buddy, you are a delight!

01:16.159 --> 01:17.035
Hmm?

01:18.953 --> 01:22.415
Hmm.
I'm probably just overreacting as usual.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.834
I'm very sensitive
to other people's needs.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.629
You could give him
a position of importance.

01:27.712 --> 01:30.006
Im

01:30.089 --> 01:33.134
Something that would give him purpose.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.844
Pur

01:34.928 --> 01:36.596
A job, Your Majesty.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.807
But he has a job as my royal advisor.

01:38.890 --> 01:41.100
I just told you how I don't listen to him.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.311
Perhaps something
he could be in charge of,

01:43.394 --> 01:45.522
something low risk.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.941
But Maurice will have to earn it,

01:48.024 --> 01:51.861
which means there'll have to be
an election with another candidate.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.072
A rube, Your Majesty.

01:54.155 --> 01:57.200
If we're talking about a rube,
you obviously mean Mort.

01:57.283 --> 02:01.830
As for the job, who do we know
that will be easy to replace?

02:05.750 --> 02:07.418
Dang fruit flies.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.420
Lucky Swatter and I are here to--ah!

02:09.504 --> 02:11.464
Keep all the--ah! Mangoes safe.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.882
Isn't that right, Swatter?

02:14.384 --> 02:15.677
Nice shot, buddy!

02:23.935 --> 02:25.311
My peepage,

02:25.395 --> 02:28.773
I'm happy to announce
that we are now going to solve

02:28.857 --> 02:30.900
one of the biggest problems

02:30.984 --> 02:33.236
in the history of all of Madagascar!

02:33.319 --> 02:34.237
What's that?

02:34.320 --> 02:36.739
Oh, you in--in the back of the people.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.160
Elect a new Prime Minister of Mangoes?

02:40.243 --> 02:43.037
That's right, you very handsome lemur

02:43.121 --> 02:45.456
with the perfect booty in the back there.

02:45.540 --> 02:49.627
Yes, we are going to elect
a new Prime Minister of Mangoes.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.297
Yes, very important position--

02:52.380 --> 02:54.090
oh, and you--you, with the...

02:54.173 --> 02:57.468
I say, I say, there should be
two candidates, only two.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.429
Maurice and, uh, Mort.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.891
Well said, Chair Lemur Table.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.393
There should be two candidates.

03:05.476 --> 03:08.813
Yes, there should be.
Maurice and--ugh, Mort.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.273
Well, people have spoken.

03:10.356 --> 03:13.192
Wait a roly-poly-pickin' moment.

03:15.778 --> 03:19.824
Shoot, looks like
I'm voting for myself again.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.285
I guess they don't need me anymore.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.163
If you two agree,

03:25.246 --> 03:27.123
I will personally fix--

03:27.206 --> 03:29.292
uh, set the election in three days.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.878
Really

03:31.961 --> 03:34.130
I totally agree, King Julien!

03:34.213 --> 03:36.507
In fact, it's quite an honor.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.635
Thank you! Thank you all!

03:38.718 --> 03:41.846
An election? Sure! Sounds like fun!

03:41.930 --> 03:45.141
I mean, what could possibly go wrong
in an election?

03:47.685 --> 03:51.231
Settle down, everyone, settle down!
Quiet, please.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.650
I've called us all together
to pick the best way to win this Prime Minister
of Mangoes thing.

03:56.152 --> 03:58.071
Election?

03:58.154 --> 04:00.615
I've heard all I need to hear.

04:00.698 --> 04:03.701
It's pretty clear that you need me.
Just ask the lemurs.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.371
You want to win this thing?
Put me on the ticket.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.831
I'm your only chance for victory.
I'm the guy.

04:08.915 --> 04:12.043
I think we all remember
what happened the last time

04:12.126 --> 04:14.462
you were in charge of things,
Political Mort.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.465
I said extra sugar

04:17.548 --> 04:19.801
in my pumpkin spice macachino!

04:22.470 --> 04:24.180
Oh, that was terrible!

04:25.306 --> 04:28.393
I don't care what any of you say.
I'm takin' charge.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.603
I'm taking over,
and I'm running this thing

04:30.687 --> 04:32.230
all the way to victory!

04:32.313 --> 04:35.024
'Cause I'm a warrior.
Warrior, warrior, warrior!

04:38.820 --> 04:40.822
Yeah, see you around, suckers!

04:46.828 --> 04:48.621
Move over, losers.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.581
-I'm driving.

04:54.502 --> 04:55.962

04:57.380 --> 04:59.257
-Zora, baby doll.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.926
How'd you like to be
the First Lady of Mangoes?

05:02.010 --> 05:03.177
Oh!

05:03.261 --> 05:05.680
They are going to love you!

05:05.763 --> 05:07.557
Ohh!

05:09.934 --> 05:12.228
You've been a good friend.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.272
Maybe the best friend I ever had.

05:14.355 --> 05:15.606
You, uh, wait here

05:15.690 --> 05:19.986
until this whole Prime Minister of Mangoes
thing gets sorted out.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.070
Don't speak.

05:21.154 --> 05:25.033
We'll smash the ever-lovin' life
out of small flying creatures

05:25.116 --> 05:27.785
together again soon, I promise.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.912
Take care of yourself!

05:32.540 --> 05:36.002
I didn't think
that it would hurt this bad!

05:42.425 --> 05:44.427
-Oh, boy.

05:48.765 --> 05:52.977
There is no way Maurice
could possibly lose this thing to Mort.

05:54.312 --> 05:58.900
Operation Cheer Up Maurice
is clearly going to be a success.

05:58.983 --> 06:03.279
I want you all to know,
as Prime Minister of Mangoes,

06:03.362 --> 06:07.366
I have a detailed plan that will keep us
from ever going hungry again.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.660
That through hard, intelligent choices,

06:09.744 --> 06:13.247
we can correct any deficiencies
in the system and--

06:13.331 --> 06:14.373
Wrong. Bored.

06:14.457 --> 06:17.210
Whatever. Bored. Boring.

06:17.293 --> 06:20.004
Yawn. Big yawn. Over here!

06:20.088 --> 06:21.839
Everybody, look at me! Look!

06:21.923 --> 06:23.299
Don't listen to Maurice.

06:23.382 --> 06:26.511
Nice guy, but he can't get the job done.
No way.

06:26.594 --> 06:29.305
You lemurs know you want me
as Prime Minister of Mangoes

06:29.388 --> 06:32.308
because you know I am a warrior! Warrior!

06:35.019 --> 06:38.481
Truth is, you need me
as Prime Minister of Mangoes.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.440
You need the Mort.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.567
You want the Mort inside you

06:41.651 --> 06:43.152
as the tiny voice in your ear,

06:43.236 --> 06:45.404
whispering the only name that matters:

06:45.488 --> 06:46.322
Mort.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.413
Okay, nothing to worry about.
Maurice can do this.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.832
People, listen to me.

06:55.915 --> 06:58.709
I've laid out a plan
for self-sustaining mango growth.

06:58.793 --> 07:02.296
-It's actually less work and more rewards.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.006
That sounds good. Right, Willie?

07:05.591 --> 07:07.343
Oh, sorry, Maurice.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.512
I was sleeping with my eyes open again.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.472
Did I miss something Mort was saying?

07:11.556 --> 07:13.683
You tell 'em, Mort!

07:15.643 --> 07:18.312
I want you all to meet my lovely wife,
Zora.

07:18.396 --> 07:22.859
Isn't she beautiful?
She's beautiful. And she's super talented.

07:22.942 --> 07:26.195
This huge she-mountain
is my super talented everything.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.323
She's got this armpit pouch
that I can just climb right inside.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.742
-Watch this.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.870
And just like that, I'm gone.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.748
And I'm back.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.584
And I'm gone.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.211
And back. And gone.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.088
Back. Gone.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.465
Here I am.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.801
I'm just a humble lemur gonna bring

07:48.885 --> 07:50.803
that stinky aye-aye to justice.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.889
Maurice is in bed with the fossa.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.891
Maurice doesn't even believe in Frank.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.810
I'm here for you.
What do you have to lose?

07:59.437 --> 08:02.440
Wow, little man tells it like it is.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.451
That Mort is high-larious!

08:13.534 --> 08:14.452
Am I right?

08:14.535 --> 08:16.204
Mort's not even making sense!

08:16.287 --> 08:17.997
Oh, he tells it like it is.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.416
He just speaking his mind, y'all.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.959
But he's not saying anything!

08:27.048 --> 08:28.257
-Yeah!
-Tell 'em, Mort!

08:30.885 --> 08:34.889
Mangoes are our main food supply!
Well, this is important, people!

08:38.476 --> 08:40.853
-Ahh.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.897
-Whoo-hoo!
-It's life or death!

08:42.980 --> 08:44.899
No mangoes, no life!

08:47.360 --> 08:51.447
Right Right
Am I right?

09:00.623 --> 09:02.625
And then these idiots...

09:10.383 --> 09:12.176
Am I right?

09:12.260 --> 09:13.719
Think of your mothers.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.930
I've had enough of this.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.268
I thought rigging an election
would be fun,

09:20.351 --> 09:22.687
but that little freak
has messed everything up!

09:22.770 --> 09:24.105
We have to fix this.

09:24.188 --> 09:27.024
Luckily, it's just a position
that doesn't matter,

09:27.108 --> 09:29.735
so we have all the time in the world.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.862
Mr. Hector?

09:31.946 --> 09:34.156
I'm out of mangoes
for my juggling act, and... -Oh, well, that's strange.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.869
Why are these mangoes that color?

09:40.580 --> 09:41.539
Oh, no. Oh, no.

09:41.622 --> 09:42.456
Mother!

09:42.540 --> 09:44.000
Help!

09:45.918 --> 09:46.919
Mother!

09:48.546 --> 09:49.922
I just--I--

09:50.006 --> 09:53.676
I can't believe
Mort could pick up such a following!

09:53.759 --> 09:56.345
It just--it boggles my mindie bits!

09:58.431 --> 10:01.851
Yeah, it's true, Your Majesty.
I've been polling people all morning.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.978
Who ya gonna vote for, eh?

10:04.061 --> 10:05.980
Who Who?

10:08.065 --> 10:09.817
They're all voting for Mort!

10:09.900 --> 10:12.445
And I went and broke my favorite pole too!

10:12.528 --> 10:15.698
I was really looking forward
to this working for Maurice,

10:15.781 --> 10:18.242
so I could totally go,
"In your face, Mo-Mo!

10:18.326 --> 10:19.452
I made this happen.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.495
I made you Prime Minister of Mangoes,

10:21.579 --> 10:23.080
and you didn't even know it!"

10:25.291 --> 10:28.085
Oh, and 'cause he's my friend and stuff.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.005
We just need some clandestine activity

10:31.088 --> 10:33.716
that will expose Mort
in some horrible way.

10:33.799 --> 10:34.842
Shame him!

10:34.925 --> 10:37.011
Yeah! And cost him his voters!

10:37.094 --> 10:39.388
I like the way you think, Clo-Clo.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.558
It should be easy to dig up dirt
on that little brain hemorrhage

10:42.642 --> 10:44.518
and take him down.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.521
Oh, I got to pack more beverages.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.399
Really need to hydrate
for these exciting debates

10:50.483 --> 10:51.817
between Mort and Maurice.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.528
No!

10:58.699 --> 11:00.076
That's it.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.494
Put your backs into it.

11:02.870 --> 11:03.746
-Ow!

11:03.829 --> 11:05.956
We've got to break out of here
and stop him.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.124
Do it for King Julien.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.213
Zora, baby, I'm going to do my thing,
you know.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.172
Ooh.

11:13.255 --> 11:18.094
Don't forget special chair,
my dumpling maker.

11:22.723 --> 11:23.974

11:44.870 --> 11:46.580
-Oh.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.999
Yes, I say. Please, please do, I say.

11:50.251 --> 11:53.587
Here we go.
Mort's gonna crash and burn now.

11:55.464 --> 11:58.884
There's no way anyone's gonna
take him seriously.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.177
