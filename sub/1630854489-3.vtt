How's Dad?

02:06.458 --> 02:08.166
Your dad died, my child.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.166
Auntie, what do you think?

Thank you.

05:11.083 --> 05:13.166
You don't have to go
to school today, my child.

05:13.250 --> 05:14.541
I know, but…

of your biological father?

27:37.375 --> 27:39.875
I mean, your-- your dad just died, Puleng.

31:47.208 --> 31:49.166

38:47.458 --> 38:49.250
K.O. is an old friend of mine.

39:53.333 --> 39:55.291
Don't worry. They're for you.
