00:02.360 --> 00:04.860
How many times have I told you,
your store is growing too quickly.

00:04.939 --> 00:05.700
You've never told me that.

00:05.810 --> 00:06.670
Your books are a mess.

00:06.780 --> 00:07.950
When have you ever seen my books?

00:08.100 --> 00:09.210
I haven't seen your books,but I know you.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.040
Let's focus,please.

00:10.130 --> 00:12.080
Look,my friend kylie's a financial whiz.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.430
She could really help you.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.740
Her father was the dean of the
business school here before he died.

00:16.830 --> 00:19.410
Before that,he was my economics department advisor.

00:19.590 --> 00:22.460
- You were an economics major?
- Yes,I was an economics major.

00:22.580 --> 00:24.470
I was this close to getting my undergrad,ok?

00:24.650 --> 00:25.480
In economics?

00:25.600 --> 00:28.500
Yes,I can add,melinda.I'm a big boy,ok?

00:28.580 --> 00:31.000
Look,kylie lost her merit scholarship.

00:31.110 --> 00:32.509
That's her loss,but it's your gain.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.690
Does she have the job or not?

00:33.790 --> 00:35.590
Well,she might have,but she's a half an hour late,

00:35.670 --> 00:36.780
and it's my night to cook.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.950
Well,I think I told her 7:30.

00:38.960 --> 00:39.880
You cook?What do you cook?

00:39.970 --> 00:40.480
Tell me about it.

00:40.610 --> 00:43.100
Well,I make a great lasagna,you told her 7:00,

00:43.180 --> 00:44.840
and I can't hire someone who's flaky.

00:45.190 --> 00:46.080
She's not flaky.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.490
She's not.She's just.

00:48.650 --> 00:49.570
she's troubled.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

02:09.479 --> 02:11.150
Why wouldn't you tell me that she's haunted?

02:11.230 --> 02:12.780
'Cause I don't know if she's really haunted.

02:12.870 --> 02:14.120
It could be anything.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.170
She's skittish,she's nervous,
she has a hard time focusing.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.420
It could be any one of your college pitfalls.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.700
It could be sex,drugs,guitar hero.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.290
So you want me to give her a job just in case she has a ghost?

02:24.450 --> 02:26.320
And if she doesn't,what do you want me to do then?

02:26.420 --> 02:27.730
Clean her dorm room,do her laundry?

02:27.920 --> 02:29.880
Melinda,this girl's father was my mentor.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.590
Please.I'm begging you.

02:32.210 --> 02:33.880
Hi!I'm sorry I'm late.

02:33.950 --> 02:34.500
You're not late.

02:34.590 --> 02:35.570
Late was 10 minutes ago.

02:35.730 --> 02:37.460
You're in a different time zone,kylie!

02:37.610 --> 02:40.890
I know,I know,I'm not sure what happened.

02:41.010 --> 02:42.820
I said informal job interview.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.360
I didn't mean that informal.

02:44.780 --> 02:45.540
Oh,well,moving right along.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.870
Kylie,melinda,melinda,kylie.

02:49.230 --> 02:49.850
Hi.

02:50.870 --> 02:53.900
It's just,it was really dark,
and I really thought that someone was.

02:55.290 --> 02:55.990
whatever.

02:56.420 --> 02:57.100
I'm sorry.

02:57.250 --> 02:59.850
You went out on a limb for me,
and I completely blew it.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.570
I guess the,uh,the job is history.

03:02.630 --> 03:03.680
No.No,not at all.

03:04.210 --> 03:05.190
When do you want to start?

03:05.960 --> 03:08.130
I knew you two kids would hit it off.

03:14.050 --> 03:16.070
Can you see us?

Oh,please don't tell me those are
all this month's receipts.

03:48.050 --> 03:52.590
No,actually,there's a bunch
from april and march,january.

03:53.020 --> 03:56.700
Hey,is that dry cleaning receipt I've been looking for.

03:57.610 --> 03:59.990
Do you think they're still going to
have my coat after 6 months?

04:00.280 --> 04:01.600
Well,it's worth giving it a try.

04:02.140 --> 04:05.170
Hey,this student that you hired,what's her deal?

04:05.590 --> 04:08.270
Uh,her name's kylie,her grades slipped,

04:08.400 --> 04:10.820
and she's trying to get her scholarship reinstated.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.760
I'm talking about her other deal.

04:13.150 --> 04:14.520
What's the reason we hired her?

04:14.860 --> 04:16.459
Well,I thought we weren't gonna talk about it.

04:16.579 --> 04:18.890
You were just gonna do your thing,
I was gonna do my thing,yada yada.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.620
Yeah,except your thing kinda becomes my thing

04:21.740 --> 04:23.030
when you bring it into the store.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.800
Well,is it really going to bother you that much
even if you don't believe it's real?

04:25.920 --> 04:29.450
No,I was just,you know,trying to know
how I should act around her.

04:29.590 --> 04:32.220
I don't want to step on any ghost toes.

04:32.580 --> 04:33.640
Well,I really appreciate that.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.950
Um,she has a ghost.

04:36.170 --> 04:38.040
That's pretty much all I know so far.

04:38.170 --> 04:41.400
Ok.Hey,I just want to remind you
that I've got that appointment

04:41.530 --> 04:44.100
with ned on thursday,so I won't be here all day.

04:44.210 --> 04:44.690
I've got it.

04:44.860 --> 04:45.910
It's on the calendar.

04:46.860 --> 04:49.550
- Hi.Am I too early?
- No,not at all.

04:49.710 --> 04:51.010
I was just getting things organized for you.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.050
Ok.

04:52.260 --> 04:55.580
- Um,you know,about that
- you can't start today?

04:55.680 --> 04:56.420
You don't want the job?

04:56.470 --> 04:58.220
No!No!I just.

04:59.280 --> 05:02.060
I just want to make sure professor
payne didn't pressure you into this.

05:02.190 --> 05:03.480
He has a way of pushing people.

05:03.620 --> 05:04.710
Yeah,you noticed that,too?

05:04.810 --> 05:05.480
Yeah.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.600
So unless you,um,actually need my help,I...

05:08.710 --> 05:11.690
trust me,when you see the books.we need it.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.920
Um,I'm just gonna grab my laptop,
and then you can get to work.

05:14.020 --> 05:14.490
Ok.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.650
So,how do you and professor payne actually know each other?

05:19.690 --> 05:21.950
Oh,we have some of the same.interests.

05:22.160 --> 05:22.990
Oh,my god!

05:23.630 --> 05:25.690
Oh!Oh,my god!

05:25.820 --> 05:26.580
They're all over me!

05:26.620 --> 05:30.040
What is this?!What is this?!What is this?!

05:30.170 --> 05:31.140
Get them off of me!

05:37.720 --> 05:39.700
Oh,my god!

05:40.380 --> 05:41.670
Are you ok?

05:41.960 --> 05:42.650
Oh,my god,melinda!

05:42.770 --> 05:43.940
- Go get jim.
- Ok.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.050
You're ok.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.380
Finish it!

05:57.150 --> 05:59.460
Finish it!

06:06.920 --> 06:08.310
Delia: He was already on his way over.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.270
Yeah,you could hear that crash
all the way across the square.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.140
Hey there,hi.My name's jim.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.800
All right,that's going to be sore for a little while.

06:16.260 --> 06:17.720
You were very lucky that that's safety glass.

06:17.930 --> 06:19.010
That could have been a lot worse.

06:19.940 --> 06:23.940
Assuming how the definition of luck changes
depending on how bad yours is.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.990
Yeah,right,being attacked by a swarm of flies,not lucky.

06:27.690 --> 06:29.260
These things happen to you a lot?

06:29.910 --> 06:31.710
Daily,yeah.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.130
What kind of things,for example?

06:38.110 --> 06:38.910
Thanks,delia.

06:39.050 --> 06:41.780
Melinda will be back any minute
with some more ice for your arm.

06:42.100 --> 06:43.760
Um,you know what,actually,I'm fine.

06:43.890 --> 06:45.630
I'll just ice it back at the dorm.

06:47.520 --> 06:51.220
I think you should come to the station with me
and let me take a better look at that.

06:51.720 --> 06:52.830
You know what,it's ok.

06:52.930 --> 06:54.090
But thank you for everything.

06:54.210 --> 06:55.980
At least let me drive you home.

06:57.170 --> 06:58.690
No,I have a car.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.040
It's ok.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.310
Thank you.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.330
So did you get a chance to debrief her?

07:10.450 --> 07:12.370
No,she was gone before I got back.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.270
Jim said she couldn't have gotten out of here fast enough.

07:15.370 --> 07:17.450
Now,you're thinking this has something do with her father,right?

07:17.550 --> 07:19.950
That's the first thing I thought of,
and the second,frankly.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.690
I mean,her father died 4 years ago.

07:21.780 --> 07:24.290
That's right around the time kylie started
going to rockland university.

07:24.370 --> 07:26.050
So why would he suddenly appear now?

07:26.140 --> 07:27.810
Maybe he's disappointed in her studies.

07:27.890 --> 07:29.680
I mean,she comes from a long line of academics.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.660
Her grandfather founded the economics department.

07:31.780 --> 07:36.620
Her father was a consultant for the world bank
before he retired to teach at rockland U.

07:36.730 --> 07:38.670
Her brother just graduated summa cum laude from here.

07:38.740 --> 07:41.090
The ghost said "finish it.

07:41.340 --> 07:42.790
" I mean,I guess that could mean college.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.150
Yeah,spoken just like ben,except for the plastic head part.

07:45.260 --> 07:48.610
It makes me wonder,if it is her father,
why he wouldn't just talk to me directly.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.160
And what's with all the weird hauntings?

07:50.240 --> 07:54.480
I mean,the heavy breathing,the doll,the flies,
it's all gotta be a symbol of some kind.

07:54.580 --> 07:56.440
Does it have anything to do with what he used to teach?

07:56.560 --> 07:58.750
No,he was an economist,not an entomologist.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.190
They're the ones that study bugs.

08:00.750 --> 08:01.810
I'm aware of that.

08:01.890 --> 08:02.540
Oh,I'm sorry.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.430
I'm always teaching,I can't help it.You know?

08:04.510 --> 08:07.300
The fact of the matter is,economists,they never speak in metaphor.

08:07.380 --> 08:09.190
That's probably why I never cut it as one.

08:09.270 --> 08:11.550
You know,nobody ever knew what the heck I was talking about.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.000
And that's different now in what way?

08:13.110 --> 08:14.090
That's very funny.

08:14.270 --> 08:18.140
Look,maybe we should just find out from kylie
if she knows anyone who died more recently.

08:18.220 --> 08:20.780
Great.That would be thanatology,the study of the dead.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.950
Look,I know that this is hard to talk about,
but when I met you,

08:27.060 --> 08:30.030
I heard a really strange.breathing noise.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.700
I really want to help you.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.179
You heard it,too,didn't you?

08:33.409 --> 08:34.820
What if I did,what does that mean?

08:35.309 --> 08:36.870
I don't know,have you heard it before?

08:38.260 --> 08:39.539
On occasion.

08:39.970 --> 08:40.870
Since when?

08:42.169 --> 08:45.380
Uh,a few months ago,when my scholarship got revoked.

08:45.510 --> 08:47.860
I'm assuming it has something to do with stress.

08:48.140 --> 08:49.030
Why?

08:51.900 --> 08:56.440
Because I can see ghosts,
and I think there's one haunting you.

08:58.410 --> 09:00.040
Ok.

09:01.430 --> 09:02.520
wow.

09:03.900 --> 09:07.980
I don't want to sound rude,but,um,
you're saying you've seen a ghost around me?

09:08.080 --> 09:12.430
I couldn't see his face,
but he was wearing a hat and a dark overcoat.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.320
Does that sound familiar?

09:16.460 --> 09:20.250
You saw a ghost in a hat and dark overcoat?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.500
- Do you know what you sound like?- Yes.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.430
Yes,I do,but if you could just go with me on it.

09:28.860 --> 09:29.930
Flies.

09:30.550 --> 09:34.020
the doll,um,weird breathing noise.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.870
Does that mean anything to you?

09:36.010 --> 09:39.330
I mean.the doll talked to you.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.540
I know you saw it.

09:41.510 --> 09:42.540
It was a talking doll.

09:42.640 --> 09:43.710
No,it was a ghost.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.680
talking to you,and it said,"finish it.

09:47.570 --> 09:48.550
" What does that mean?

09:48.730 --> 09:49.560
Finish what?

09:50.420 --> 09:51.910
I think this conversation.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.350
I have to go.

09:54.810 --> 09:56.740
Kylie,I really want to help you.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.310
Has anyone around you died recently?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.450
No,not really,actually.

10:04.190 --> 10:06.930
Could this have anything to do with your dad?

10:08.240 --> 10:10.760
Could scaring you be his way of getting you to finish?

10:10.850 --> 10:14.070
Stop it.Don't talk about my dad.

10:14.430 --> 10:15.810
It's bad enough that I've lost him.

10:15.910 --> 10:17.790
Don't make him into some freak ghost.

10:18.420 --> 10:20.700
And by the way,about that job,I quit.

10:32.630 --> 10:33.320
She's scared.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.350
And she's hiding something,
but I'm never going to know what it is,

10:36.430 --> 10:38.060
because I'm never going to see her again.

10:38.760 --> 10:39.830
You're too hard on yourself.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.590
I should have known just to back off,you know?

10:41.680 --> 10:43.590
Even the word "ghost" was wigging her out.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.400
This is not your fault,all right?

10:45.490 --> 10:48.250
She was probably terrified by one of payne's lectures,right?

10:48.950 --> 10:50.760
Nice try.Thanks.

11:29.100 --> 11:30.500
Mel,what's wrong?

11:32.630 --> 11:33.680
Wait a minute.

11:35.390 --> 11:38.690
Wait a minute,it's just like that
scene from that japanese horror film!

11:39.460 --> 11:39.960
What was?

11:40.110 --> 11:41.400
The vision I just had!

11:42.600 --> 11:43.830
Flies!

11:43.940 --> 11:45.920
Amityville horror,or the fly!

11:46.190 --> 11:47.090
The...the doll.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.940
Puppet master,or chucky!

11:50.290 --> 11:51.470
The overcoat.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.000
Oh,my god,the overcoat.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.350
Just pick one.

11:54.900 --> 11:58.350
I can't believe i r-neve-I can't believe I didn't see it!

11:58.460 --> 11:59.110
See what?

11:59.300 --> 12:00.670
The hauntings.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.590
They're all scenes from hvir moorroes.

12:05.510 --> 12:06.320
Let's narrow this down.

12:06.430 --> 12:10.690
We need to find someone who's close to you
that died recently that was a horror film buff.

12:10.720 --> 12:11.820
Anything?

12:12.040 --> 12:14.290
Well,what do you expect?

12:14.370 --> 12:16.450
I expect you to tell me the truth if you want help.

12:16.550 --> 12:20.330
Look,if melinda says you have a ghost,hey,you have a ghost.

12:20.930 --> 12:23.440
Ok,so what if I have one?

12:23.540 --> 12:24.810
What...what's the deal?

12:24.890 --> 12:25.970
What does that mean?

12:26.070 --> 12:29.440
Well,ghosts,if they're here,
it's usually because they have unfinished business.

12:30.070 --> 12:31.220
- Like what?
- Whatever.

12:31.310 --> 12:32.590
It could be anything with a loved one.

12:32.690 --> 12:35.510
It could be unresolved issues of guilt,anger,forgiveness.

12:35.710 --> 12:39.190
Can.this ghost hurt me?

12:39.330 --> 12:42.390
Actually,if they get angry,they can get pretty nasty.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.380
What aren't you telling me,kylie?

12:45.500 --> 12:46.760
There's something you're not telling me.

12:46.870 --> 12:47.920
Did somebody close to you die?

12:48.010 --> 12:49.010
I need to know.

12:49.110 --> 12:53.390
No,I've known people to die,yeah,
but no one close or anything.

12:53.480 --> 12:53.990
Hey,kylie.

12:54.730 --> 12:55.750
Cram session.

12:55.860 --> 12:56.820
Let's get a move on.

12:56.960 --> 12:57.570
I have to go.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.910
I don't want to be the first sloan to not graduate.

13:03.620 --> 13:04.560
Are you at the film school yet?

13:04.650 --> 13:05.820
Did you get any answers?

13:05.900 --> 13:07.810
Rick: Yes,nothing happened,no one died.

13:07.890 --> 13:11.780
I'm telling you,no faculty members,
no janitors,no students,nothing.

13:11.870 --> 13:14.510
If something like that happened,
it would have been all over the campus.

13:14.580 --> 13:18.760
It's not,uh,it's not like we drop
like flies around here,no pun intended.

13:18.850 --> 13:21.440
Well,aren't there any students that are into the genre?

13:21.500 --> 13:23.580
I mean,there is a class or a club or anything?

13:23.670 --> 13:24.200
I'm looking.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.670
I'm at the bulletin board now.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.870
There's a flyer up here for musical theater club.

13:29.120 --> 13:30.280
That's spooky.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.210
Keep looking.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.990
What else do I have?I have a missing kitty.

13:34.610 --> 13:36.170
All right,this is different.

13:36.820 --> 13:40.930
"Scared sane... "we're holding auditions
for a new kind of horror film.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.170
"Ever wonder why some movies terrify you?

13:43.540 --> 13:47.270
"Are you brave enough to enter your own personal horror
"to see what lies within?

13:47.360 --> 13:49.190
Enlightenment awaits.

13:50.010 --> 13:51.560
" Sounds like a real horror buff.

13:51.650 --> 13:53.210
Is there a name,phone number,anything?

13:53.290 --> 13:56.800
Let's see,auditions are at
some downtown production facility.

13:56.900 --> 14:00.250
There's a name,toby bates,
but as far as a number goes,you're out of luck.

14:00.370 --> 14:01.660
It's a couple months old.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.580
Well,fax it over and I'll check it out.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.020
- Ok.
- Thanks.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.880
Hangs up phone Toby.

14:33.090 --> 14:34.460
Ringing Toby?

14:37.640 --> 14:39.130
I'm looking for toby bates.

14:56.410 --> 14:57.420
Hello?

14:58.900 --> 14:59.970
Is anyone there?

15:08.700 --> 15:10.880
Why do I always
get the scary stuff?

15:29.460 --> 15:30.500
Who are you?

15:40.660 --> 15:42.390
Oh, you want to play?

15:42.830 --> 15:44.130
Is that it?

15:50.270 --> 15:51.090
Ok.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.100
So which one is this?

15:53.710 --> 15:55.630
The maze from the shining,
children of the corn,

15:55.680 --> 15:57.720
or the spaceship from alien?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.100
What?

16:09.280 --> 16:10.140
Who are you?

16:24.500 --> 16:25.720
So what is this?

16:27.400 --> 16:29.300
The maze from the shining,
children of the corn

16:29.320 --> 16:31.460
or the spaceship
from alien? What?

16:36.280 --> 16:37.750
Oh, you want to play?

16:37.750 --> 16:48.150
Oh, you want to play?

16:56.330 --> 16:58.670
Ok, here it is,
toby bates' obit.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.010
"Guerilla filmmaker
falls to his death."

17:01.040 --> 17:02.250
This happened 3 months ago.

17:02.270 --> 17:04.300
Oh, that's right, when kylie
said the hauntings started.

17:04.319 --> 17:05.630
She said no one
close to her died.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.200
We should ask her if
she knew this kid toby.

17:08.230 --> 17:10.640
It says he wasn't a student,
so that's not their connection.

17:10.660 --> 17:12.430
He was just a kid
shooting a film.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.540
Yeah, lots and lots
of film apparently.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.619
There's massive amounts
of files on this computer.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.119
Thank goodness you had the
mental fortitude to steal it.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.690
Hey, I did not steal it.

17:20.710 --> 17:23.210
This ghost wanted my help,
led me to that editing bay,

17:23.240 --> 17:24.780
and in fact, probably
wanted me to take it.

17:24.790 --> 17:25.440
What I still want to know is

17:25.480 --> 17:27.839
what are we going to
do about skippy here.

17:27.890 --> 17:29.160
I mean, what is he
good for except for

17:29.180 --> 17:30.630
a free ride in
the carpool lane?

17:30.650 --> 17:32.150
And what's he doing
in my good chair?

17:32.180 --> 17:34.690
More importantly, why is
he wearing toby's clothes?

17:34.710 --> 17:36.840
I mean, it's gotta be a prop
from one of his movies, right?

17:36.870 --> 17:37.620
I hope so.

17:37.650 --> 17:38.960
Oh, listen to his profile.

17:38.980 --> 17:42.070
"I want to push classic horror
past the scare to enlightenment,

17:42.090 --> 17:46.150
use the genre to dive into the
darkness of souls and set them free."

17:47.190 --> 17:49.150
To think I was just watching
scary movies for fun.

17:49.180 --> 17:50.260
Do you think
kylie was in one of

17:50.290 --> 17:51.680
toby's movies and
that's how they met?

17:51.720 --> 17:52.940
There's an audition
file in there.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.830
I think we could look
to see if she's in it.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.650
What horror movie
really scares you?

17:59.660 --> 18:01.290
That movie where the arm
comes up out of the grave

18:01.320 --> 18:04.610
and it like--ugh--
like, super creepy, yeah.

18:07.450 --> 18:09.380
What--wait a minute.
I know this kid.

18:09.420 --> 18:11.070
He's one of kylie's friends.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.590
well, that's great. So
there's a connection at least.

18:15.590 --> 18:17.420
I mean, you can talk to
this bruce guy tomorrow

18:17.440 --> 18:18.810
and find out what
he'll tell us.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.270
I mean, maybe he's
being haunted, too.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.670
No, I'm not--I'm
not talking to him.

18:21.700 --> 18:22.820
You do the talky talk.

18:22.830 --> 18:24.590
That's your job.
It always has been.

18:24.590 --> 18:26.710
Except that I have to be
at my other job tomorrow.

18:26.740 --> 18:28.500
Delia's got the day off.
Look, you're gonna be great.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.690
What are we gonna
do about her?

18:40.240 --> 18:41.700
Yeah, I remember this.

18:42.300 --> 18:43.760
Actually worked on this film.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.000
Guy called it a "shockumentary,"
making you face your fears.

18:47.030 --> 18:48.380
I call it sick.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.590
Well, after you worked in it,

18:49.620 --> 18:52.020
did you notice anything
strange or supernatural

18:52.040 --> 18:54.030
that happened to you
in the last 3 months?

18:54.780 --> 18:57.290
-I aced my bio quiz.
-Wow, that is spooky, my man.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.520
I don't know how
you sleep at night.

19:00.010 --> 19:01.710
Anything, for real?
Did you notice anything?

19:01.710 --> 19:03.270
No, man, it was just a movie.

19:03.900 --> 19:04.460
All right.

19:04.470 --> 19:06.560
Well, what is a
shockumentary? What is that?

19:06.810 --> 19:08.710
He would ask you what
classic horror movies

19:08.720 --> 19:11.250
scared you the most,
and then, you know,

19:11.260 --> 19:12.530
he'd put you in
the scariest scenes,

19:12.550 --> 19:14.700
making you experience the
horror over and over again.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.980
Guy was a psycho.

19:16.090 --> 19:17.560
Now, I didn't know a
movie that's scared me,

19:17.580 --> 19:19.240
so he put me in
somebody else's fear.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.800
I play the priest
in the exorcist.

19:20.820 --> 19:22.720
This guy just liked
scaring people,

19:22.740 --> 19:23.930
or was there a
point to all of it?

19:23.950 --> 19:25.180
I don't know. I didn't
stick around to find out.

19:25.180 --> 19:27.190
Hey, brother, I
don't blame you.

19:27.210 --> 19:28.980
I wasn't scared, I was pissed.

19:29.090 --> 19:31.250
I ran into a friend that night
who had just wrapped her segment,

19:31.280 --> 19:33.150
looked like she got
in a car accident.

19:33.170 --> 19:35.690
She said her scariest movies
were blair witch and evil dead,

19:35.710 --> 19:37.970
so toby left her alone in
the woods for a whole night.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.210
Nearly lost her mind.

19:39.710 --> 19:40.990
Was kylie in a movie?

19:41.150 --> 19:42.520
No, she had no
interest in acting.

19:42.660 --> 19:43.710
I didn't think so.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.140
But she sure grilled toby
about what he was doing.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.730
I didn't know she was
such a major horror buff.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.310
Wait a minute, kylie
and toby, they met?

19:49.310 --> 19:51.530
Yeah. I dragged
her along with me.

19:51.530 --> 19:53.250
Toby even wanted her
to audition for it.

19:53.270 --> 19:55.580
She said no, and
it got kinda nasty.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.310
-What else happened?
-Oh, we left.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.020
But you should have seen
the look on toby's face.

20:01.510 --> 20:02.700
He was pissed.

20:10.190 --> 20:12.610
So kylie was at the
audition, she did meet toby.

20:12.740 --> 20:14.830
Yeah, turns out she's a
giant horror film buff.

20:14.870 --> 20:16.260
She even insulted his work.

20:16.330 --> 20:18.050
So why has she been
covering it with us?

20:18.060 --> 20:20.830
Have I not been trying to figure
that out the entire ride over here?

20:20.870 --> 20:22.200
I don't know, I
wasn't with you.

20:22.230 --> 20:24.120
You're right, that was,
uh, skippy. I forget.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.330
You guys look so much alike.

20:25.620 --> 20:26.910
Well, we were
trying to figure out,

20:26.930 --> 20:28.480
and we came up with
nothing, we were stymied.

20:28.510 --> 20:29.850
So we called
kylie's cell phone

20:29.870 --> 20:31.020
and it went right
to voicemail.

20:31.150 --> 20:32.840
It's ok, she'll call back
when she gets scared enough

20:32.860 --> 20:34.810
and it'll probably
be soon. Look at this.

20:34.810 --> 20:38.280
I spent the last 3 hours looking
at more of toby's footage.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.220
Ooh, I feel your pain.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.240
You know, the big crime is
efthat bore this kid died,

20:42.260 --> 20:43.980
he didn't set some
time aside to edit.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.350
Well, actually, he did.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.710
I found something that
looked like a movie

20:47.740 --> 20:50.020
he was starting to
assemble. Brace yourself.

21:00.840 --> 21:01.620
Oh, my gosh!

21:01.630 --> 21:03.820
That person was
actually buried alive!

21:04.340 --> 21:05.230
How is that therapy?

21:05.250 --> 21:07.020
How could toby get away
with something like that?

21:07.040 --> 21:09.550
Actors will pretty much do
anything to get themselves on film.

21:09.570 --> 21:11.520
So this is a shockumentary.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.810
Yeah, all the segments
are about 5 minutes long,

21:13.830 --> 21:15.900
and he's put 6
together so far.

21:16.810 --> 21:19.990
Let's see, you have cindy's
fear: Friday the 13th,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.450
janet's fear: I know
what you did last summer.

21:23.870 --> 21:27.020
-billy's fear...
-yeah, he cast on fear, not type.

21:27.020 --> 21:29.110
I mean, it's pretty terrifying,
I had to turn it off.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.230
Well, that's weird, melinda.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.460
I mean, some of the date
stamps on these edits

21:32.480 --> 21:33.500
are within the last month.

21:33.530 --> 21:34.930
One of these is
from yesterday!

21:34.950 --> 21:36.890
But one of us had the
computer the whole time.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.950
-I mean, he couldn't have cut it, could he?
-Why couldn't he?

21:39.950 --> 21:42.010
I mean, we've seen
him manipulate footage,

21:42.030 --> 21:43.360
surveillance camera stuff.

21:43.380 --> 21:45.100
I mean, it's not
that far of a leap.

21:48.180 --> 21:50.390
He's making his
movie from the grave.

22:15.060 --> 22:16.600
********I'm home.

22:17.390 --> 22:17.970
Thank god you're home.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.780
This movie's really
starting to freak me out.

22:20.410 --> 22:21.040
What is it?

22:21.690 --> 22:25.340
It's the movie that the ghost
was making, or is making.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.990
And your favorite genre.

22:27.010 --> 22:28.200
No, except this
one's different.

22:28.210 --> 22:30.290
These are real people,
and they're really scared.

22:30.310 --> 22:32.360
It's like freddy
krueger meets punk'D.

22:32.390 --> 22:35.450
Apparently kylie tiedck
this guy off in an audition.

22:35.470 --> 22:37.860
Well, I know he's a
ghost, so that's not good.

22:37.880 --> 22:40.200
Yeah, I'm just trying to see
if there's any more to it.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.500
Well, if you're
actually sort of scared,

22:42.520 --> 22:43.860
why don't you
turn the lights on?

22:44.010 --> 22:45.720
Are you kidding me?
And ruin the fun?

22:46.640 --> 22:48.370
I don't understand you people.

22:48.460 --> 22:49.390
I'm gonna hit the shower.

22:49.410 --> 22:51.100
Get me the hell out of here!

22:51.170 --> 22:52.710
What are you afraid of?

22:52.730 --> 22:53.560
I want out!

22:54.320 --> 22:56.960
-I know you're...
-what are you afraid of?

22:58.330 --> 23:00.370
Jim, stop it, seriously.

23:00.790 --> 23:03.430
What are you afraid of?

23:14.080 --> 23:15.070
All right, that's it!

23:15.110 --> 23:17.270
Toby, stop it!
Do you hear me?!

23:17.460 --> 23:19.130
It was bad enough
when you were alive.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.110
I thought you wanted to play.

23:22.660 --> 23:24.710
I thought you loved
those slasher movies.

23:24.850 --> 23:25.870
You have to stop doing this.

23:25.880 --> 23:28.450
Just let me try and
help you move on.

23:28.860 --> 23:31.030
Not until she finishes it.

23:31.290 --> 23:32.780
Who, kylie?

23:32.790 --> 23:34.940
What is it that you
want her to finish?

23:34.970 --> 23:38.170
Ask her. She knows.

23:45.630 --> 23:46.660
Did you talk to kylie?

23:46.680 --> 23:48.700
No, I called,
went by her dorm.

23:48.710 --> 23:52.230
I think she's avoiding us, and
there's something you should see.

23:52.520 --> 23:53.200
Yeah.

23:58.220 --> 23:59.010
Was that a person?!

23:59.010 --> 24:01.100
No. That was
skippy over there.

24:01.100 --> 24:03.460
But I know why you're queasy.
Does any of that look familiar?

24:03.460 --> 24:05.020
That's the place
where toby died.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.720
I recognize the for rent
sign from his obituary.

24:07.740 --> 24:10.240
He was doing a stunt.
That's how he died.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.150
Wait a minute.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.470
Shouldn't you buy
him a drink first?

24:20.840 --> 24:22.020
Look, ok?

24:22.050 --> 24:26.340
The movie that he was making
before he died, it was the exorcist.

24:26.370 --> 24:27.650
I'm with you, I think.

24:28.020 --> 24:29.770
The falling through the
glass, the heavy breathing,

24:29.790 --> 24:32.670
the things that he was
haunting kylie with,

24:32.690 --> 24:34.110
it's all things
from the movie,

24:34.130 --> 24:35.530
so it has to mean
something to her.

24:35.940 --> 24:37.170
Wait a minute, what was that?

24:37.320 --> 24:38.120
I didn't see that before.

24:38.150 --> 24:40.270
It's one of the soundtracks
attached to the raw footage.

24:40.290 --> 24:43.030
They must have mixed it
down into logged clips.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.650
-let's do one more.
-What?

24:46.230 --> 24:49.350
Well, that's toby, but you
can hear someone else. Listen.

24:49.390 --> 24:51.570
What? Why? We're not gonna
get a better take than that.

24:51.570 --> 24:53.040
-It's kylie.
-Yeah.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.680
She was working with him.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.020
Just not in front
of the camera.

25:17.840 --> 25:20.350
Hey, kylie, it's melinda.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.050
If you're there,
please pick up.

25:22.210 --> 25:23.240
I need to talk to you.

25:23.430 --> 25:24.620
I know you were
working with toby.

25:24.640 --> 25:27.000
What I don't understand
is why you didn't tell us.

25:27.500 --> 25:30.070
I know you're scared, but
you need to let us help you

25:30.710 --> 25:32.430
before this gets
even worse. Just--

25:42.360 --> 25:44.440
Testing, testing.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.900
Final death scene, take one.

25:50.610 --> 25:53.100
Final death scene, take one.

25:56.820 --> 25:59.240
Final death scene, take one.

26:02.870 --> 26:06.710
Testing.Final death
scene, take one.

26:07.180 --> 26:09.510
Final death scene, take one.

26:13.650 --> 26:16.580
Death scene, death
scene, death scene,

26:16.610 --> 26:19.630
death scene, death
scene, death scene,

26:19.650 --> 26:25.910
death scene,
death scene--

26:27.530 --> 26:41.980
death scene, death
scene, death scene,

26:42.550 --> 26:45.100
all right, I need you to tell
me the truth. What happened?

26:45.100 --> 26:49.410
Death scene, death scene,
death scene, death scene--

26:49.430 --> 26:50.200
I killed him.

26:50.230 --> 26:52.470
Death scene, death scene,
death scene, death scene.

26:54.190 --> 26:55.610
I.*********

26:57.470 --> 26:58.990
I just didn't want
to believe you.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.740
The thought of
toby haunting me is.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.410
it's too awful.

27:05.760 --> 27:08.150
Why don't you tell me exactly
what happened that night.

27:09.140 --> 27:11.160
I was supposed to be there.

27:12.610 --> 27:14.200
He had the shot all set up.

27:14.230 --> 27:16.100
It was actually pretty cool.

27:16.960 --> 27:20.210
This interior angle shot
of the priest falling.

27:20.630 --> 27:24.800
Bruce quit, so toby
had to stand in.

27:27.970 --> 27:29.610
It was a 2-person job.

27:32.240 --> 27:37.220
And I guess he
tripped, and fell.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.560
It's horrible.

27:44.410 --> 27:45.950
That's what happened to toby.

27:46.240 --> 27:47.450
But you weren't there.

27:49.050 --> 27:50.480
It was an accident, so.

27:51.330 --> 27:53.270
why do you think
it's your fault?

27:53.290 --> 27:54.550
Because.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.200
that's the day I
lost my scholarship.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.710
I've just been so invested
in making this movie

28:01.740 --> 28:03.930
that I've let my
course work slip.

28:03.960 --> 28:07.430
I'm skipping deadlines,
I'm flunking tests.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.600
You--you
can't quit.

28:10.300 --> 28:11.390
This is our baby.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.440
No, this is your baby.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.680
And it's been fun, and we've
had our kicks, but it's over.

28:16.700 --> 28:19.640
No, you don't understand.
I'm doing this for you.

28:19.640 --> 28:22.450
-You need to face your fears.
-Please don'T.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.080
I don't want to do this.

28:24.110 --> 28:26.380
Yes, you do, and
that's what scares you.

28:26.440 --> 28:29.280
I haven't even told my
friends about working with you.

28:38.120 --> 28:41.910
What embarrasses you
more, me or making movies?

28:44.150 --> 28:47.240
-It's just. it's not me.
-Yes, it is.

28:47.980 --> 28:50.300
What is holding you
back? You can do this.

28:50.570 --> 28:52.290
Why are you turning
your back on it?

28:53.190 --> 28:54.510
You love making movies.

28:54.520 --> 28:58.440
Why is what I do
so important to you?

29:01.220 --> 29:02.500
Do you have something to say?

29:03.710 --> 29:05.190
'Cause if you do, say it.

29:05.220 --> 29:06.510
I want to hear it.

29:07.370 --> 29:08.490
I do.

29:14.860 --> 29:16.110
This isn't about me.

29:22.510 --> 29:23.770
It's never about you.

29:24.350 --> 29:26.920
You think hiding behind
a camera gives you a pass.

29:27.260 --> 29:30.020
From our friendship and
from all human interaction.

29:30.050 --> 29:32.350
No, that's the only
way that it works.

29:32.530 --> 29:34.630
Ok, that's the only way
that I can get people

29:34.670 --> 29:36.730
to be themselves on camera.

29:36.750 --> 29:38.420
I have to be invisible.

29:39.110 --> 29:43.230
I hope you and your camera
have a very happy life together.

29:45.180 --> 29:46.270
I'm done.

29:51.550 --> 29:53.660
I shouldn't have
walked away like that.

29:56.070 --> 29:57.460
I don't think
toby's haunting you

29:57.470 --> 29:59.140
because he thinks
you killed him.

29:59.170 --> 30:01.360
Of course he does, why
else would he be doing this?

30:01.380 --> 30:03.760
I think he wants you
to face your worst fear,

30:04.240 --> 30:06.490
whatever it is
about that movie.

30:07.520 --> 30:08.590
God.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.610
I'm so tired of hearing that.

30:11.640 --> 30:12.600
What do you mean?

30:12.620 --> 30:14.960
I know why the
exorcist scares me.

30:19.270 --> 30:24.300
The day my dad died, a priest
was reading his last rites.

30:25.590 --> 30:27.040
It was horrible.

30:28.500 --> 30:32.120
That's why I can't-- I
can't watch that movie.

30:33.590 --> 30:34.910
I get it.

30:35.690 --> 30:37.840
-Nowhw at?
-I don't know.

30:39.290 --> 30:41.550
I don't understand
what he wants, then.

30:42.320 --> 30:44.060
I want her to finish it.

30:45.700 --> 30:48.560
If she's faced her fears,
I want her to finish it.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.410
Finish what?

30:51.590 --> 30:52.920
Is he here?

30:55.560 --> 30:56.710
He was.

30:58.810 --> 31:00.030
What did he say?

31:00.580 --> 31:03.890
He said if you faced your
fears, he wants you to finish it.

31:04.240 --> 31:06.310
Do you know what that means?

31:06.330 --> 31:07.710
It means.

31:10.690 --> 31:12.250
he's not gonna stop.

31:13.230 --> 31:15.940
And this isn't gonna
end, and you can'T.

31:16.550 --> 31:17.310
help me.

31:17.310 --> 31:18.510
Yes, I can.

31:20.330 --> 31:21.540
I promise.

31:36.940 --> 31:39.490
You need to leave kylie alone.

31:40.470 --> 31:41.880
That's funny.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.810
I was going to say the same thing to you.

31:43.820 --> 31:45.340
You're making it worse.

31:45.350 --> 31:47.360
She needs to figure it out on her own.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.680
Why is that important to you,
that she finishes the movie?

31:51.290 --> 31:53.180
Why do you this to people?

31:53.280 --> 31:56.190
Everyone has something that they're afraid of;

31:56.280 --> 31:57.910
something that holds them back.

31:57.920 --> 32:00.260
There's always a reason.

32:00.270 --> 32:02.610
Like you,and those slasher films.

32:02.620 --> 32:03.440
Let's look at that.

32:03.450 --> 32:04.750
Give me a break.

32:04.760 --> 32:10.140
Don't you ever wonder why those films
leave you feeling sick and exposed?

32:10.730 --> 32:13.170
What deep,dark memory do they stir?

32:13.180 --> 32:14.140
I don't need your help.

32:14.150 --> 32:17.110
Those films are usually about abandonment.

32:17.910 --> 32:19.280
Who abandoned you,melinda?

32:19.590 --> 32:21.680
Who left you alone in the dark?

32:22.750 --> 32:24.030
Your mother?

32:24.860 --> 32:26.020
Your father?

32:27.780 --> 32:29.230
That's it,isn't it?

32:30.600 --> 32:32.660
- Was he a
- stop it.

32:33.630 --> 32:37.430
I am all for self reflection,
but you're the earth-bound spirit.

32:37.490 --> 32:39.390
You're the one who has issues.

32:40.140 --> 32:41.630
Are you sure?

32:43.680 --> 32:47.730
By the way,kylie's going to
finish what we started.

32:47.870 --> 32:49.520
She has no choice.

33:13.670 --> 33:15.090
Ok,toby,I'm here.

33:15.290 --> 33:17.140
This is where we were going to shoot the last.

33:17.310 --> 33:18.610
it's where you died.

33:19.110 --> 33:20.900
Did you want to see me scared?

33:22.540 --> 33:24.040
Did you want to see me...

33:24.060 --> 33:25.440
...crack?

33:26.350 --> 33:28.420
Well,it worked.

33:29.070 --> 33:30.540
I'm terrified.

33:32.650 --> 33:34.110
Now what do you want from me?

34:33.719 --> 34:35.000
Is this it?

34:37.239 --> 34:38.429
I don't get it.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.340
I am trying,damn it!

34:40.860 --> 34:43.060
I've done everything that you wanted!

34:43.280 --> 34:45.480
I watched the movie a million times!

34:45.489 --> 34:47.540
I don't know what I'm supposed to face!

34:47.550 --> 34:49.020
I'm done living it!

34:50.780 --> 34:52.380
Do I have to die,too?

34:52.739 --> 34:54.280
Do I have to die,too?

35:17.060 --> 35:19.110
Wow,you really know what you're doing.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.030
Tell that to this machine.

35:22.240 --> 35:24.330
What is wrong with this thing?!

35:24.510 --> 35:25.870
What do you want from me?!

35:26.030 --> 35:28.460
I shot your movie,I cut it!

35:29.200 --> 35:30.940
It's finished. Just let me be done with it!

35:30.950 --> 35:32.200
Kylie,everything's going to be ok.

35:32.210 --> 35:33.320
No,it's not.

35:33.330 --> 35:34.780
He won't let me lock the cut.

35:34.790 --> 35:35.690
He won't let me finish.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.510
Kylie,no one's here.

35:37.710 --> 35:39.340
He's been here all night.

35:39.850 --> 35:43.390
He's haunted me every step.

35:43.460 --> 35:44.880
I beliyoeve U.

35:46.600 --> 35:47.700
Why do you think he's doing that?

35:47.740 --> 35:50.360
I don't know,I told you.

35:52.190 --> 35:53.490
Tell me about the breathing.

35:54.830 --> 35:55.910
What about it?

35:56.020 --> 35:59.260
Toby seems to think it's the key,
and you're the only one who knows why.

35:59.270 --> 36:00.330
The breathing.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.970
is it about your father,the way he died?

36:23.130 --> 36:27.240
The summer before I leorft f rockland,
I had,uh,I had an internship

36:28.090 --> 36:29.940
at this investment firm in the city.

36:29.950 --> 36:35.170
And every day I ate lunch at
the washington square park.

36:35.180 --> 36:37.480
It's right by nyu.A lot of film
students hung out there,

36:38.320 --> 36:44.750
and I would just.do wardrobe,
grip,camera,whatever they needed.

36:47.910 --> 36:49.310
It was.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.320
it was the best summer of my life.

36:51.430 --> 36:53.550
But what I didn't know was that entire time.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.990
my dad was dying.

36:58.330 --> 36:59.940
Your family didn't tell you?

36:59.980 --> 37:03.660
They didn't want to distract me,
I guess,from my work.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.670
I would have taken any excuse to quit.

37:08.680 --> 37:13.780
I didn't want to go into finance,
I wanted to make films.

37:16.780 --> 37:18.620
And I was gonna tell him.

37:19.580 --> 37:21.270
After the summer was over.

37:25.820 --> 37:30.320
But then one morning,my mom called
and she said I'd better get home,and.

37:32.340 --> 37:34.340
I couldn't believe.

37:34.850 --> 37:39.450
how frail he looked. How weak he was.

37:40.560 --> 37:43.910
He kept slipping in and out of consciousness,

37:43.990 --> 37:47.210
and then finally,he smiled at me.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.020
He told me to come close.

37:53.470 --> 37:56.220
That's--that's probably why the
breathing was so hard for me,

37:56.740 --> 37:58.170
that night.

38:00.370 --> 38:02.430
And the last words he said to me,.

38:02.770 --> 38:04.620
he could barely speak

38:05.490 --> 38:09.680
And when I looked up,and I saw the priest,

38:11.670 --> 38:13.370
I knew he was dying.

38:16.830 --> 38:18.590
What things did he say to you?

38:18.890 --> 38:21.790
He said I would always be his angel,

38:24.250 --> 38:26.620
and that I was just so much like him.

38:29.870 --> 38:31.210
What else?

38:31.830 --> 38:33.470
Think.

38:33.910 --> 38:35.900
I would do great things.

38:38.700 --> 38:40.270
I would never let him down.

38:42.530 --> 38:44.300
But I did let him down.

38:44.310 --> 38:45.910
I lost my scholarship.

38:47.800 --> 38:51.240
I've given up completely on everything
that he would have wanted for me,.

38:51.250 --> 38:54.250
everything he cared about

38:54.690 --> 38:55.850
Kylie.

38:57.690 --> 38:59.150
he cared about you.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.950
He wouldn't be proud of me making horror films!

39:02.990 --> 39:05.290
Do you like making horror films?

39:08.580 --> 39:10.170
More than anything.

39:10.180 --> 39:13.700
Well,I'm pretty darn sure he'd be impressed
with you making horror films.

39:13.760 --> 39:17.060
No,not dad. You knew him.He's...

39:17.710 --> 39:18.570
yeah,I knew him.

39:18.580 --> 39:21.960
Who do you think it was that convinced
me to write books about voodoo?

39:22.590 --> 39:24.020
Not my father.

39:24.030 --> 39:26.710
Yes,your father,my friend ben told me,

39:26.720 --> 39:29.770
and I'm only mildly paraphrasing here,

39:29.780 --> 39:33.820
he said,"rick,if I had half the passion
for numbers that you have for shrunken heads,

39:33.930 --> 39:36.800
"I would run,I wouldn't walk,
to the nearest convention of the dead.

39:36.810 --> 39:39.000
" And that's what I did,kylie.

39:41.410 --> 39:43.040
That's what he meant that day.

39:43.050 --> 39:44.720
That's what he was trying to say to you,

39:45.450 --> 39:47.430
that if you find your passion,
you'll do great things.

39:47.440 --> 39:48.850
Don't you see that?

39:57.000 --> 39:58.840
It worked.

40:00.680 --> 40:02.120
She did it.

40:02.170 --> 40:05.280
She figured out what was holding her back.

40:05.730 --> 40:06.840
Yeah.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.120
Now how about you?

40:09.330 --> 40:12.190
This was about kylie,
about her following her dream.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.270
I'm--I'm done.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.770
Is this.

40:15.870 --> 40:17.350
is toby here?

40:17.480 --> 40:18.580
Yes.

40:18.590 --> 40:20.830
I think there's something he'd like to say to you.

40:20.860 --> 40:22.260
Oh,no,there isn'T.

40:22.270 --> 40:23.520
Is he hiding?

40:24.130 --> 40:26.740
He doesn't like it when the camera's on him.

40:29.460 --> 40:32.080
This could be your last
chance to ever talk to her.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.160
Go for it.

40:35.490 --> 40:36.900
Face your fears.

40:39.450 --> 40:42.210
It's funny,because my whole life,

40:42.860 --> 40:44.630
I tried to be invisible.

40:45.480 --> 40:48.820
Now I'd give anything
for her to be able to see me.

40:49.350 --> 40:51.780
He wishes that you could see him right now.

40:52.270 --> 40:53.030
Tell him I can.

40:53.470 --> 40:54.730
Really?

40:55.750 --> 40:57.610
It's that angle 2 shot.

40:57.930 --> 40:59.130
we did.

41:01.370 --> 41:02.890
At the beach.

41:03.570 --> 41:05.220
With the guy and the girl.

41:05.660 --> 41:10.190
It's sunset,and they were so afraid
to tell each other how they felt.

41:12.130 --> 41:14.440
And the world was coming to an end.

41:23.890 --> 41:25.350
Tell her I remember.

41:32.770 --> 41:33.980
Oh,man.

41:33.990 --> 41:35.110
Look at that.

41:38.710 --> 41:40.140
He sees the light.

41:55.820 --> 41:58.030
Tell her I'll save her a good seat.

42:37.400 --> 42:38.690
Who are you?

42:38.730 --> 42:40.470
What do you want?

42:44.030 --> 42:45.220
Melinda!

42:45.270 --> 42:46.210
Hey,what's up?

42:46.220 --> 42:48.350
- What's going on?
- I just had the worst dream.

42:48.360 --> 42:49.570
Are you ok? That's crazy

42:49.760 --> 42:51.850
No,it was so real.

42:52.970 --> 42:53.900
It's like it actually happened.

42:53.910 --> 42:57.280
There was this strange man coming towards me,
and he had on a mask.

42:57.340 --> 42:58.480
The guy in the horror flick.

42:58.490 --> 42:59.750
No,this was real.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.290
- Honey,it's just a dream.
- No.

43:04.730 --> 43:06.060
This happened.

43:07.380 --> 43:08.970
This was a memory.

43:10.300 --> 43:12.070
When I was younger.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.170
this happened to me.

43:17.450 --> 43:19.180
Hey,come here.
