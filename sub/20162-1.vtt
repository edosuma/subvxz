01:03.863 --> 01:05.664
Here's a surprise.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.934
Guess who's not coming
to Thanksgiving?

01:08.936 --> 01:10.169
Your dad?

01:10.171 --> 01:13.105
He's such a hypocrite.
I hate hypocrites.

01:13.107 --> 01:14.306
I'm sorry.

01:18.678 --> 01:20.245
Is this for me?

01:20.247 --> 01:22.281
I figured you'd have
more use for it than I will.

01:22.283 --> 01:25.617
Right.
Thanks.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.052
I swear to God.

01:27.054 --> 01:30.255
The man is incapable
of keeping a promise.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.690
What was his reason?

01:31.692 --> 01:33.392
<i>You tell me.</i>
<i>He's your friend.</i>

01:33.394 --> 01:36.895
- Carrie--
- He said he has to, um,
stay in London.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.598
Why would anyone choose
to stay in London?

01:39.600 --> 01:41.033
London's awful.

01:41.035 --> 01:42.634
When's the last time
you were in London?

01:42.636 --> 01:45.137
<i>When I was 12.</i>

01:45.139 --> 01:47.306
When your mom was sick?

01:47.308 --> 01:48.607
Don't do that.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.808
<i>Do what?</i>

01:49.810 --> 01:52.277
Make associations
in your head.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.179
I don't like London
because it is cold,

01:54.181 --> 01:55.547
it is repressed.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.782
And everyone
looks like they've smoked

01:56.784 --> 01:57.950
too many cigarettes.

01:57.952 --> 02:00.719
Did you make any friends
this week?

02:00.721 --> 02:02.020
You and I both know

02:02.022 --> 02:03.288
there's a perfectly
good reason

02:03.290 --> 02:04.389
I don't have any friends.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.724
So, what
did you do this week?

02:05.726 --> 02:07.426
<i>What I normally do.</i>

02:07.428 --> 02:10.461
- Reading?
- Mostly.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.232
<i>And how many books</i>
<i>did you read?</i>

02:13.234 --> 02:14.199
Seventeen.

02:16.769 --> 02:18.370
And does reading
17 books in one week

02:18.372 --> 02:19.638
seem normal to you?

02:19.640 --> 02:22.274
No, no, of course
it's not normal.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.143
I mean, does skipping

02:24.145 --> 02:26.011
three grades of school
seem normal?

02:26.013 --> 02:29.581
Does going to Harvard
at the age of 14 seem normal?

02:29.583 --> 02:31.216
I'm clearly not normal.

02:31.218 --> 02:33.685
I thought we'd established
that was the problem.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.555
Carrie, I want you to do
something for me.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.590
<i>What?</i>

02:38.592 --> 02:40.125
You and I
are going to come up with

02:40.127 --> 02:41.627
a list of goals
you're going to achieve

02:41.629 --> 02:43.295
between now
and the end of the year.

02:43.297 --> 02:46.498
<i>So, for our next session,</i>
<i>I want you to think about</i>

02:46.500 --> 02:48.934
some of the things
you'd like to have
on that list.

02:48.936 --> 02:52.004
Things you've done
in your life and enjoyed.

02:52.006 --> 02:54.573
What kind of things
do you expect me

02:54.575 --> 02:55.674
to put on this list?

02:55.676 --> 02:57.442
For example,
join a club.

02:57.444 --> 03:00.179
Why should I force myself
to go out and meet people

03:00.181 --> 03:03.882
who have lowered
their moral, ethical,
and intellectual standards

03:03.884 --> 03:05.484
in order to fit in
with other people

03:05.486 --> 03:08.387
who have low moral, ethical,
and intellectual standards?

03:08.389 --> 03:10.689
You're such a contrarian.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.757
No, I'm not.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.425
( chuckles )

03:13.427 --> 03:14.526
( snickers )

03:15.562 --> 03:16.929
A little helpful advice.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.631
<i>One,</i>
<i>try to stop pontificating</i>

03:19.633 --> 03:21.900
<i>and rubbing</i>
<i>your exceptionally high IQ</i>

03:21.902 --> 03:23.802
<i>in people's noses.</i>

03:23.804 --> 03:25.771
Two, give humanity
a chance.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.406
Someone
might surprise you.

03:29.409 --> 03:30.709
Time's up.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.977
Carrie, wait.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.212
You were quite late,
so I don't mind

03:33.214 --> 03:34.446
<i>going a couple</i>
<i>of minutes over.</i>

03:34.448 --> 03:35.781
I do.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.216
I'm actually in the middle
of reading

03:37.218 --> 03:38.951
Foucault's
"Archeology of Knowledge."

03:38.953 --> 03:42.821
I highly recommend it,
by the way.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.657
And, if you
speak to my dad,

03:45.659 --> 03:47.226
please give him
the message

03:47.228 --> 03:50.095
that I don't accept
his excuses or his apologies

03:50.097 --> 03:51.563
and that hiring me
a therapist

03:51.565 --> 03:53.498
is no more
a satisfactory replacement

03:53.500 --> 03:55.000
for an actual parent,

03:55.002 --> 03:56.568
than sending me
off to college

03:56.570 --> 03:59.004
at an inappropriately
young age.

04:05.745 --> 04:06.845
Sorry for being, um--

04:06.847 --> 04:08.914
I completely understand.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.515
Happy Thanksgiving.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.484
<i>You too.</i>

04:23.529 --> 04:25.530
Hey, Carrie.
What's up?

04:25.532 --> 04:27.432
Hi, Ronald.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.437
- Do you need a menu?
- Oh, sure.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.474
Someone still
buys DVDs, huh?

04:35.476 --> 04:36.942
Someone still does, yeah.

04:36.944 --> 04:37.943
And you know what?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.411
I have never had to wait

04:39.413 --> 04:42.014
for the movie to load
halfway through the film.

04:45.418 --> 04:46.852
I'll have the soup.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.954
Yeah, sure.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.435
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

05:03.437 --> 05:07.706
Look, before you launch
into your moves or whatever,

05:07.708 --> 05:09.541
I just want you to know

05:09.543 --> 05:11.143
that I'm not really
in the right frame of mind

05:11.145 --> 05:12.944
to make flirty chitchat
with a total stranger.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.479
Even though, admittedly,
you're quite a cute one.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.915
But I've just--
dealing with being let down

05:16.917 --> 05:18.950
by my dad--
not for the first time.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.353
And I've just had
a really tough session

05:21.355 --> 05:22.454
with my therapist.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.955
- Um--
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

05:23.957 --> 05:27.559
I just wanted to know
if I can borrow this chair.

05:27.561 --> 05:31.496
Oh, definitely.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.131
Yes.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.500
Take it.
Knock yourself out!

05:35.502 --> 05:37.035
Not with the...
chair.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.343
( bell jingles )

05:45.378 --> 05:47.279
Girl:
Hey!

05:54.020 --> 05:55.654
Do you want me
to pack this to go?

05:55.656 --> 05:58.357
Yes!
Please, yes.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.668
<i>( woman speaking on TV )</i>

06:18.978 --> 06:21.113
<i>( didgeridoo drones )</i>

06:22.148 --> 06:24.116
What the hell is that?

06:33.826 --> 06:38.130
Yo! World music guy!

06:38.132 --> 06:39.498
- Hey!
- <i>Can you go</i>

06:39.500 --> 06:40.832
and hold your one-man

06:40.834 --> 06:43.402
aborigine festival thing
somewhere else?

06:43.404 --> 06:45.470
Like Australia?

06:45.472 --> 06:47.205
Sure.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.277
( ringtone plays )

06:56.682 --> 06:58.116
Hi, Dad.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.551
Dad:
<i>Hello, darling,</i>
<i>how are you?</i>

06:59.553 --> 07:00.986
Got your message.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.888
You're not coming
for Thanksgiving.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.623
Shocker.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.991
Dad:
<i>So sorry, darling.</i>

07:05.993 --> 07:07.692
<i>I really thought</i>
<i>I could swing it,</i>

07:07.694 --> 07:10.495
<i>but I just</i>
<i>can't get away.</i>

07:10.497 --> 07:12.497
<i>It's such</i>
<i>an American thing anyways.</i>

07:12.499 --> 07:15.367
<i>I promise I'll be there</i>
<i>for Christmas.</i>

07:15.369 --> 07:18.270
Well,
it would have been nice

07:18.272 --> 07:20.205
to have a bit
more notice.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.374
<i>But listen,</i>
<i>I do have good news.</i>

07:22.376 --> 07:25.076
<i>I've found you a job</i>
<i>at the law firm</i>

07:25.078 --> 07:26.445
<i>of a friend of mine.</i>

07:26.447 --> 07:28.980
In what world
is that good news?

07:28.982 --> 07:32.117
If anything,
that is very, very <i>bad</i> news.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.585
<i>But it'll be good</i>
<i>for you.</i>

07:33.587 --> 07:36.755
Well, I'm still four years
ahead of my peers.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.758
Do you want me
to be maladjusted?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.393
<i>It'll be easy,</i>
<i>I promise.</i>

07:41.395 --> 07:45.464
<i>It's a night job,</i>
<i>proofreading legal briefs.</i>

07:45.466 --> 07:47.532
<i>You love reading.</i>

07:47.534 --> 07:49.301
Not proofreading,

07:49.303 --> 07:51.937
and certainly not
legal briefs.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.239
<i>Well, at least</i>
<i>it'll be quiet.</i>

07:54.241 --> 07:55.874
<i>You won't have</i>
<i>to talk to a soul</i>

07:55.876 --> 07:58.243
<i>if you don't want to.</i>

07:58.245 --> 08:01.847
<i>If you have a better offer,</i>
<i>by all means.</i>

08:01.849 --> 08:04.416
What happened
to "Take some time"?

08:04.418 --> 08:07.252
<i>Well, it has</i>
<i>been a year, darling.</i>

08:07.254 --> 08:09.321
<i>And to be</i>
<i>absolutely honest,</i>

08:09.323 --> 08:11.022
<i>it would really help</i>
<i>if you could</i>

08:11.024 --> 08:14.759
<i>bring something to the table,</i>
<i>so to speak.</i>

08:14.761 --> 08:18.597
Isn't there
some other way?

08:18.599 --> 08:22.934
<i>You could get a roommate</i>
<i>instead if you prefer.</i>

08:22.936 --> 08:26.004
Okay, fine.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.573
I'll take the job.

08:28.575 --> 08:31.910
<i>( "Morning"</i>
<i>by Edvard Grieg plays )</i>

08:31.912 --> 08:33.778
( elevator bell dings )

08:43.722 --> 08:44.890
( phones ringing )

08:45.925 --> 08:47.626
Hello?

08:51.130 --> 08:53.198
( phone ringing continues )

09:55.528 --> 09:57.796
- What you listening to?
- Hmm?

10:00.433 --> 10:04.536
Wait, isn't that
from Bugs Bunny?

10:04.538 --> 10:09.874
It's "Morning."
"Peer Gynt," Edvard Grieg.

10:09.876 --> 10:12.811
I'm pretty sure that's from
one of the "Looney Tunes."

10:12.813 --> 10:14.212
Who are you?

10:14.214 --> 10:18.149
- Douglas.
- Do you work here?

10:18.151 --> 10:20.885
No, I just didn't
have anyone

10:20.887 --> 10:22.354
to spend
Thanksgiving with,

10:22.356 --> 10:23.755
so I've been wandering
around the building

10:23.757 --> 10:27.225
hoping to find someone
to share my turducken.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.260
- ( chuckles )
- Right.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.096
I'm kidding.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.031
You're Carrie Pilby,
right?

10:33.033 --> 10:34.866
I might be.

10:34.868 --> 10:38.737
Sometimes when the documents
get copied and/or faxed,

10:38.739 --> 10:41.406
the periods end up
looking like commas.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.142
And the "Hs" end up
looking like "Ks,"

10:44.144 --> 10:46.144
You know,
that sort of thing.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.680
No wonder lawyers
charge 400 bucks an hour,

10:48.682 --> 10:50.749
they pay people
to play "Concentration."

10:50.751 --> 10:53.685
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Douglas got to you first.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.286
I always try to get
to the new people

10:55.288 --> 10:57.956
before he does,
but he's quick as lighting.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.257
Ooh.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.659
I'm Tara.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.860
Carrie.

11:01.862 --> 11:02.994
I wish
I could say he's more

11:02.996 --> 11:04.362
the exception
to the rule,

11:04.364 --> 11:05.997
but what can I tell you?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.966
This job attracts
a strange breed.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.134
Clearly.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.702
<i>( phone rings )</i>

11:10.704 --> 11:12.570
( chuckles )

11:12.572 --> 11:14.906
You're gonna fit in
just fine.

11:45.504 --> 11:48.840
Holidays are a drag, huh?

11:51.877 --> 11:54.045
For some people, yes.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.748
What did you do for yours?

11:56.750 --> 11:58.016
Nothing.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.919
Just--
just went to work.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.620
What?
You got a job?

12:02.622 --> 12:04.422
Well, my dad
got it for me.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.057
Kind of
a consolation prize

12:06.059 --> 12:07.525
for not coming
to Thanksgiving.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.360
But I didn't have
to eat any dry turkey

12:09.362 --> 12:10.795
or talk to anyone.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.063
Wonderful.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.199
So, how's it going
with the list?

12:14.201 --> 12:15.500
<i>What list?</i>

12:15.502 --> 12:17.435
The list we talked
about last time.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.205
I have no recollection
of this list.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.006
You've got
a photographic memory.

12:22.008 --> 12:24.909
- It's selective.
- Excuse.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.144
I've been very busy.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.145
Excuse.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.613
I haven't had time to--

12:28.615 --> 12:30.081
- Excuse!
- Stop saying--

12:30.083 --> 12:31.382
Excuse.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.684
<i>Well, not to worry.</i>

12:34.253 --> 12:35.553
I made one for you.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.557
Go on, read it.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.128
"Go on a date."

12:43.130 --> 12:44.129
( laughs )

12:44.131 --> 12:46.231
"Make a friend.

12:46.233 --> 12:49.200
Spend New Year's Eve
with someone.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.769
Get a pet."

12:50.771 --> 12:52.871
It'll help to have something
to care for.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.139
Keep going.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.307
"Do something
you loved as a child."

12:56.309 --> 12:57.442
Like what?

12:57.444 --> 13:01.179
Well,
it could be anything.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.081
What did you do
when you were six

13:03.083 --> 13:04.282
that you don't do anymore?

13:04.284 --> 13:06.484
I wrote several
strongly-worded letters

13:06.486 --> 13:09.354
to oil companies
when I was six.

13:09.356 --> 13:12.323
Wow, okay.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.159
How about an indulgence

13:14.161 --> 13:17.195
<i>that you no longer</i>
<i>allow yourself?</i>

13:17.197 --> 13:20.165
I used to love
drinking cherry soda.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.566
<i>Excellent,</i>
<i>there you go.</i>

13:21.568 --> 13:24.602
Great, I'll drink
a cherry soda

13:24.604 --> 13:27.272
and all my problems
will just disappear.

13:27.274 --> 13:31.242
What's next?

13:31.244 --> 13:33.444
"Read favorite book."

13:33.446 --> 13:36.815
Ah!
Do you have one?

13:36.817 --> 13:41.286
Yeah, "Franny and Zooey,"
Salinger.

13:41.288 --> 13:45.023
But I don't have it.
I lent it to someone.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.925
Can you get it back?

13:46.927 --> 13:48.860
I don't know.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.228
Well, look, just try.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.331
See how it goes,
do what you can,

13:53.333 --> 13:54.699
one at a time.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.335
Why do you want me
to do this so much?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.404
Because staying
at home in bed all day

13:59.406 --> 14:00.805
won't make you happy.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.273
<i>You need to get out</i>
<i>and meet people,</i>

14:02.275 --> 14:05.677
begin some
meaningful relationships.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.479
<i>Maybe if you</i>
<i>put yourself out there,</i>

14:08.481 --> 14:11.249
<i>doing things you enjoy...</i>

14:11.251 --> 14:13.651
<i>( keyboard clacking )</i>

14:18.324 --> 14:21.492
Hmm, "Franny and Zooey,"
one of my favorites.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.995
You've got good taste.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.266
Well, welcome

14:28.268 --> 14:31.202
to English 303,
the Modernists.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.471
I'm Professor Harrison,
and you are a bunch of kids

14:33.473 --> 14:34.739
who think you already
know everything

14:34.741 --> 14:35.840
but haven't even
got a clue

14:35.842 --> 14:37.175
about what life
is really like

14:37.177 --> 14:38.643
beyond the ivy walls.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.745
It's banal,
nauseating carousel

14:40.747 --> 14:43.348
of responsibility
and disappointments,

14:43.350 --> 14:44.549
<i>one after another.</i>

14:44.551 --> 14:47.318
But, my sweater
is soft and the rain

14:47.320 --> 14:49.721
streaking down
the window is kinda lovely,

14:49.723 --> 14:52.423
so I guess I won't
off myself just yet.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.725
( students chuckling )

14:53.727 --> 14:57.362
The Modernists,
especially Joyce and Wolff

14:57.364 --> 14:59.631
<i>were very big</i>
<i>on stream of consciousness</i>

14:59.633 --> 15:01.266
<i>techniques</i>
<i>in their novels,</i>

15:01.268 --> 15:03.268
and you just got
your first lesson in it.

15:03.270 --> 15:06.738
Would anyone
like to give it a try?

15:06.740 --> 15:09.040
Say whatever
pops into your mind.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.877
"Franny and Zooey,"
how about you?

15:12.879 --> 15:16.481
Oh, I wouldn't know
what to say.

15:16.483 --> 15:17.582
It's not difficult.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.950
You just start
with your name,

15:18.952 --> 15:20.685
where you're from,
kinda go from there.

15:22.988 --> 15:28.593
My name's Carrie Pilby,
I-- well I was born in London

15:28.595 --> 15:30.662
but I moved to New York
when I was 12

15:30.664 --> 15:32.563
just after my mom died.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.732
I guess I shouldn't
have said that,

15:34.734 --> 15:35.900
'cause now everyone's
feeling weird

15:35.902 --> 15:37.969
about the girl
whose mom died.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.971
Like I'm Antigone
or Harry Potter,

15:39.973 --> 15:41.806
or Bambi or something.

15:41.808 --> 15:46.177
But I'm not a Greek tragedy
or a wizard.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.412
( chuckling continues )

15:47.414 --> 15:49.948
And if I was a character
in a movie,

15:49.950 --> 15:53.451
I'd like to be
Katherine Hepburn,

15:53.453 --> 15:54.719
preferably in a movie
where she gives

15:54.721 --> 15:56.487
Spencer Tracy
a run for his money.

15:56.489 --> 16:00.458
But I can tell
I'm boring you now.

16:00.460 --> 16:05.496
And this is hard,
harder than skipping
fourth and eighth grade.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.732
But not as hard
as skipping second grade,

16:07.734 --> 16:09.634
because going
from pencil to pen

16:09.636 --> 16:11.436
- was pretty abrupt.
- ( girl chuckles )

16:11.438 --> 16:12.804
Professor Harrison:
<i>Excellent.</i>

16:12.806 --> 16:14.906
If you want to use
pencil in my class,

16:14.908 --> 16:16.741
you're more
than welcome.

16:16.743 --> 16:19.177
Now, anyone else
wanna give it a shot?

16:25.284 --> 16:28.353
Man:
<i>Carrie? Carrie?</i>

16:28.355 --> 16:29.821
<i>I really believe</i>

16:29.823 --> 16:31.956
<i>that if you do the things</i>
<i>on this list,</i>

16:31.958 --> 16:36.494
you're going to feel
a lot better about life.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.628
I bet I won't.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.497
<i>So, prove it.</i>

16:39.499 --> 16:42.100
Prove to me
that I don't know how

16:42.102 --> 16:43.368
to do my job.

16:43.370 --> 16:48.806
- You're a very odd man.
- Thank you.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.142
That's the nicest compliment
I've had all day.

17:04.123 --> 17:05.623
Hi.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.626
Davy, I would like
a goldfish, please.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.395
We're having
a two-for-one special.

17:10.396 --> 17:11.429
I just want one.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.698
But the other one
is free.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.933
They're social creatures.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.268
You heard me say
I want a fish, right?

17:17.270 --> 17:18.603
Not a chimpanzee.

17:18.605 --> 17:21.973
Fish swim in schools.
They like company.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.077
Fish swim in schools
because, evolutionarily,

17:26.079 --> 17:28.246
it gives them
a better chance of surviving.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.280
My fish is going
to be living

17:29.282 --> 17:30.415
in a one bedroom
apartment,

17:30.417 --> 17:31.816
not the Great Barrier Reef.

17:33.519 --> 17:35.219
Fine, just
give me two fish.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.988
Great!

17:41.760 --> 17:43.861
Woman:
<i>Taxi!</i>

17:46.298 --> 17:47.665
( shutter clicks )

17:47.667 --> 17:48.933
( camera whirs )

17:52.104 --> 17:53.471
Carrie:
<i>Katherine...</i>

17:53.473 --> 17:56.841
your job
is to prove Petrov wrong.

17:56.843 --> 18:02.647
Spencer, your job is to keep
Katherine happy.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.884
<i>( man coughs )</i>

18:15.227 --> 18:16.661
Hey!

18:16.663 --> 18:18.796
Get away from there
before I call the police!

18:18.798 --> 18:20.531
Why?

18:20.533 --> 18:22.300
One, because
you're clearly smoking

18:22.302 --> 18:23.401
something illegal.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.702
And two,
because it looks like

18:24.704 --> 18:26.104
you're about to burgle
that apartment.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.339
Why would I want to burgle
my own apartment?

18:28.341 --> 18:30.741
- You don't live there.
- Well, then I definitely

18:30.743 --> 18:32.844
- need to stop paying rent.
- No, some other guy

18:32.846 --> 18:36.147
- lives there.
- Yeah, my roommate, Ted.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.583
Okay, well,
if it's your apartment,

18:38.585 --> 18:39.984
why do you play
your didgeridoo

18:39.986 --> 18:42.120
in the street
like a crazy hippy?

18:42.122 --> 18:44.722
Because Ted doesn't like me
practicing in the apartment.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.825
I can't say I blame him.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.862
You wanna play it?

18:50.864 --> 18:52.663
It might help you relax.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.298
What makes you think
I'm not relaxed?

18:54.300 --> 18:56.367
When people's shoulders
aren't naturally aligned

18:56.369 --> 18:59.070
with their earlobes
like that.

18:59.072 --> 19:01.038
Maybe I'm cold.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.407
Maybe you shouldn't make
assumptions

19:03.409 --> 19:04.876
about people
you don't know.

19:04.878 --> 19:09.347
Hey listen, I was just
razzing you-- I didn't--

19:09.349 --> 19:11.916
...mean anything by it.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.700
I am going to work.

19:29.702 --> 19:33.137
If anyone calls,
take a message.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.443
<i>( phones ringing )</i>

19:47.386 --> 19:51.822
Did you just have an orgasm
over a cherry soda?

19:53.292 --> 19:57.862
Can you just leave me
to drink my soda in peace?

19:57.864 --> 19:59.130
Oh, of course, of course,

19:59.132 --> 20:03.701
I'll let you two
have some privacy.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.404
( chuckles )

20:15.514 --> 20:17.148
( shutter clicks )

20:20.185 --> 20:22.320
So, what's your deal?
Are you a student?

20:22.322 --> 20:24.589
No, I graduated
last year.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.390
<i>From where?</i>

20:26.392 --> 20:27.625
Boston.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.493
Boston University?

20:29.495 --> 20:31.796
No, it was in
Cambridge actually.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.332
<i>Emerson, Brandeis,</i>
<i>Northeastern...</i>

20:34.334 --> 20:35.666
Harvard.

20:35.668 --> 20:38.536
So, why don't you
just say Harvard?

20:38.538 --> 20:40.771
Because when
I say Harvard,

20:40.773 --> 20:42.640
people always reply
with something asinine,

20:42.642 --> 20:45.176
like,
"Say something smart."

20:45.178 --> 20:47.445
Hey, did you know Carrie
went to Harvard?

20:47.447 --> 20:49.547
No way.
Say something smart.

20:51.717 --> 20:53.384
No, no.

20:53.386 --> 20:54.352
Seriously.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.624
I think the influence

20:59.626 --> 21:02.093
of Kierkegaard on Camus
is underestimated,

21:02.095 --> 21:04.528
I believe Hobbes
is just Rousseau
in a dark mirror,

21:04.530 --> 21:05.763
and I truly
believe with Hegel

21:05.765 --> 21:08.199
that transcendence
is absorption.

21:08.201 --> 21:09.233
Cool.

21:09.235 --> 21:12.003
I have no idea
what you just said,

21:12.005 --> 21:13.704
but you sure sound
like a friggin' genius.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.374
I stole that
from "Infinite Jest"

21:16.376 --> 21:17.708
by David Foster Wallace.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.678
Oh, come on.
Smart and pretty?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.480
You must be killing it
out there.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.714
You have a boyfriend?

21:23.716 --> 21:25.283
Is that really
your next question?

21:25.285 --> 21:27.918
Okay, so what kind of guy
are you looking for?

21:27.920 --> 21:30.488
I'm not looking
for any kind of guy.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.989
So, you go for girls?

21:31.991 --> 21:33.724
No, I'm not a lesbian.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.393
Are you a nun?

21:35.395 --> 21:37.228
Good one.

21:39.898 --> 21:41.799
I can't believe
you've never had Moroccan.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.467
I've always wanted
to try it.

21:43.469 --> 21:44.769
And thanks
for inviting me.

21:44.771 --> 21:45.870
Well,
I couldn't have you alone

21:45.872 --> 21:47.405
on Thanksgiving,
now could I?

21:47.407 --> 21:49.907
What, so you don't take
all your students to dinner?

21:49.909 --> 21:51.776
Only my best
and brightest.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.544
( chuckles )

21:53.546 --> 21:54.979
Sparkling water
for the lady,

21:54.981 --> 21:57.748
and a glass of Barolo
for me, please.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.551
Thank you.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.720
You know...

22:02.722 --> 22:06.657
I skipped a grade of school
growing up, too.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.093
Yeah,
it was so frustrating

22:09.095 --> 22:10.294
knowing
that I was smarter

22:10.296 --> 22:11.796
than most
of the adults I knew,

22:11.798 --> 22:14.498
and yet they still
treated me like a child.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.602
I hated, absolutely hated,
being treated like a child.

22:18.604 --> 22:21.806
Yeah,
I really hate that too.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.808
Although,
I technically was a child

22:23.810 --> 22:25.176
until fairly recently.

22:25.178 --> 22:29.647
Yeah, but you've got
an old soul.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.015
And I'm kind of young
at heart,

22:31.017 --> 22:32.917
so I guess we meet
in the middle.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.486
Yeah. Thanks.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.888
Thank you.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.090
Well, cheers.

22:39.092 --> 22:41.425
- ( glasses clink )
- Cheers.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.797
Oh, oh,
that's just masterful.

22:46.799 --> 22:50.835
Really, really delicious.
How's your water?

22:50.837 --> 22:54.772
It's pedestrian,
with a frothy finish.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.174
Would you like
to taste my wine?

22:57.176 --> 22:58.976
Okay.

22:59.978 --> 23:00.978
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.780
Okay, okay.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.715
First, breathe in
the bouquet.

23:06.585 --> 23:08.352
All right,
now take a sip.

23:10.655 --> 23:14.425
Let the wine
coat your tongue.

23:15.827 --> 23:17.595
Really?

23:17.597 --> 23:19.597
That looks good on you.

23:19.599 --> 23:20.865
What?

23:20.867 --> 23:24.969
The wine.
It stained your lips red.

23:28.573 --> 23:32.843
Man #2:
<i>It's in every single</i>
<i>sexual fantasy I have.</i>

23:32.845 --> 23:35.613
<i>Things are going great,</i>
<i>and then right before</i>
<i>the main event,</i>

23:35.615 --> 23:37.014
<i>the phone rings.</i>

23:37.016 --> 23:38.716
Man:
<i>Do you answer it?</i>

23:38.718 --> 23:40.985
Man #2:
<i>No, but it still</i>
<i>totally ruins the moment.</i>

23:40.987 --> 23:44.288
So, things
get hot and heavy,

23:44.290 --> 23:46.757
but just before intercourse,
the phone rings.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.194
Man #2:
<i>And then, my penis</i>
<i>becomes the size of a nub.</i>

23:50.196 --> 23:51.929
<i>It practically</i>
<i>disappears.</i>

23:51.931 --> 23:53.130
<i>I'm like a Ken doll</i>

23:53.132 --> 23:54.165
- with no genitalia--
- Oh, uh--

23:54.167 --> 23:55.699
- Good God.
- Sorry.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.435
I thought I was late.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.437
I'm sorry, George.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.105
It is time, in fact.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.274
Let's come back
to this next week, shall we?

24:03.276 --> 24:06.444
Oh, we have a couple
more minutes remaining.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.045
But we could tack
that onto next week?

24:08.047 --> 24:09.680
Absolutely.
Thank you, George.

24:09.682 --> 24:13.851
Okay.
Thank you, doc.

24:13.853 --> 24:17.621
- Call me.
- Carrie!

24:17.623 --> 24:18.689
Carrie!

24:18.691 --> 24:20.191
That was awful.

24:20.193 --> 24:22.560
And I'd appreciate
you not listening in

24:22.562 --> 24:23.928
on my sessions.

24:23.930 --> 24:27.531
Sorry, the door was just
flat enough for my...

24:27.533 --> 24:29.033
for my ear.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.168
Anyway, I was very eager
to get here,

24:31.170 --> 24:33.838
because I have
your precious list,

24:33.840 --> 24:36.373
and I'll have you
know I've already ticked

24:36.375 --> 24:37.975
two things off.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.910
- Really?
- Don't act so surprised.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.879
I'm a very good student,
you know.

24:41.881 --> 24:43.881
All right.
Well, let's hear it, then.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.150
<i>Okay, firstly...</i>

24:46.152 --> 24:48.953
I'll admit the cherry soda
was excellent.

24:48.955 --> 24:50.254
Very good.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.056
The jury's still out
on the goldfish.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.390
They don't do much.

24:53.392 --> 24:56.327
Well, when it comes
to goldfish,

24:56.329 --> 24:58.462
I'd lower
my expectations.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.065
Good start.

25:01.067 --> 25:06.937
Maybe if we can focus
on some of these other things.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.372
<i>Carrie.</i>

25:10.509 --> 25:13.978
What's so great
about being happy anyway?

25:13.980 --> 25:18.682
There are some
brilliant unhappy people.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.352
Kierkegaard, Beethoven,

25:21.354 --> 25:23.521
Van Gough...

25:23.523 --> 25:25.155
Morrissey!

25:25.157 --> 25:28.759
Anyway,
I'm not unhappy.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.528
You'd be
a lot more convincing

25:30.530 --> 25:32.530
if you could look at me
when you say that.

25:36.468 --> 25:39.503
One of these days,
you should decide

25:39.505 --> 25:42.306
you're going to let someone
get to know you.

25:42.308 --> 25:46.510
You can start
by trusting me.

25:46.512 --> 25:48.012
Don't you think

25:48.014 --> 25:49.380
that real companionship
would help?

25:49.382 --> 25:50.915
What about going
on a date?

25:50.917 --> 25:52.650
Any more thoughts
about that?

25:52.652 --> 25:55.753
Why does everyone act
like sex is this magical,

25:55.755 --> 25:57.021
happiness cure-all?

25:57.023 --> 25:58.289
I didn't say anything
about sex.

25:58.291 --> 25:59.490
Well, then,
you're the only one,

25:59.492 --> 26:00.824
because it seems
to be the only thing

26:00.826 --> 26:02.560
anyone talks about.

26:02.562 --> 26:04.161
<i>Who's anyone?</i>

26:04.163 --> 26:07.765
Well, people at work,
people I overhear in cafes.

26:07.767 --> 26:11.235
That weird little perv
who was in here just now,

26:11.237 --> 26:12.836
talking about
his disappearing penis.

26:12.838 --> 26:14.104
Please, leave him
out of this.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.507
Why can't I go into
a grocery store

26:16.509 --> 26:19.043
without being
accosted by headlines

26:19.045 --> 26:21.579
claiming 101 ways
to have an orgasm.

26:21.581 --> 26:24.748
Wouldn't 50 three-ways
be sufficient?

26:24.750 --> 26:26.317
Wouldn't-- wouldn't one?

26:26.319 --> 26:30.387
Well, it's true that sex
is a big part of adult life.

26:30.389 --> 26:31.855
If it weren't,
the human population

26:31.857 --> 26:32.856
would die out.

26:32.858 --> 26:33.958
But it doesn't mean

26:33.960 --> 26:35.326
that everyone
is sex obsessed.

26:35.328 --> 26:37.161
<i>It may seem</i>
<i>like that to you now,</i>

26:37.163 --> 26:38.729
<i>but I would gather</i>
<i>that if you were older</i>

26:38.731 --> 26:42.132
and had more experience,
it wouldn't seem as glaring.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.467
What makes you think

26:43.469 --> 26:45.603
that I'm not
sexually experienced?

26:45.605 --> 26:48.238
Are you?

26:48.240 --> 26:49.807
I can have opinions

26:49.809 --> 26:53.344
regardless of whether
I myself have had sex.

26:53.346 --> 26:55.312
True,
but it's hard to comment

26:55.314 --> 26:57.448
on what it's like
to fly in an airplane

26:57.450 --> 26:59.283
if you've never been
off the ground.

27:01.186 --> 27:05.155
<i>However,</i>
<i>if you have had</i>
<i>sexual experiences,</i>

27:05.157 --> 27:06.256
<i>and you want</i>
<i>to discuss them--</i>

27:06.258 --> 27:09.226
No thanks.
Ew.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.363
Anyway, you can't just
go on a date.

27:12.365 --> 27:14.098
You have to be asked.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.666
Not necessarily.

27:15.668 --> 27:19.570
I refuse to troll
the Internet for a date.

27:19.572 --> 27:21.672
I don't know,
You just might end up

27:21.674 --> 27:23.340
having the most fun
you've ever had.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.943
Or I 'll end up
locked in a crate

27:25.945 --> 27:27.244
and shipped overseas

27:27.246 --> 27:28.946
to be
a Saudi prince's sex slave.

27:28.948 --> 27:31.015
My guess is
it'll probably end up

27:31.017 --> 27:32.850
being somewhere
in between the two.

27:37.155 --> 27:41.225
"Single male
seeks adventurous woman

27:41.227 --> 27:43.994
into hiking..."
Blah, blah.

27:43.996 --> 27:48.065
"Single male, 76."

27:48.067 --> 27:49.733
No.

27:49.735 --> 27:55.372
"Single white male,
engaged and confused.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.841
Due to be married,
but want to test

27:57.843 --> 27:59.510
the waters first."

27:59.512 --> 28:00.978
( scoffs )

28:00.980 --> 28:05.549
That has to be the most
inappropriate ad <i>ever</i> posted.

28:05.551 --> 28:07.751
All right.
( clears throat )

28:07.753 --> 28:10.154
( dialing )

28:10.156 --> 28:12.423
I do not need
to be judged by you

28:12.425 --> 28:13.490
right now, Katherine.

28:13.492 --> 28:16.226
Petrov said,
"Go on a date."

28:16.228 --> 28:19.997
He didn't say it couldn't be
to rat out a cheat.

28:19.999 --> 28:23.734
I could find out
the name of his fiancée

28:23.736 --> 28:25.502
and warn her. Huh?

28:25.504 --> 28:27.404
Kill two birds
with one stone.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.706
Cross off the list,

28:28.708 --> 28:31.141
and catch a hypocrite
in the act.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.676
( dials )

28:32.678 --> 28:34.378
<i>( phone rings )</i>

28:34.380 --> 28:36.947
Shh.
It's ringing.

28:36.949 --> 28:38.482
<i>( ringing continues )</i>

28:38.484 --> 28:39.983
Man on recording:
<i>Hello, this is Matt.</i>

28:39.985 --> 28:42.119
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

28:42.121 --> 28:44.521
<i>( beeps )</i>

28:44.523 --> 28:46.356
Hi, Matt.

28:46.358 --> 28:49.493
You sound
really, really cute.

28:49.495 --> 28:52.596
I sympathize
fully with your situation.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.565
I'm dating
this great guy,

28:54.567 --> 28:57.067
but there's
just no chemistry

28:57.069 --> 28:59.002
and I wanna see
if I'm right.

28:59.004 --> 29:01.305
When I saw your ad,
I thought, well,

29:01.307 --> 29:03.774
this could be discreet way
to find out.

29:03.776 --> 29:04.808
Like you said.

29:04.810 --> 29:07.978
My name is...

29:09.013 --> 29:12.182
Gloria Patch.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.851
Gloria Patch.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.052
( mouthing words )
What?

29:15.054 --> 29:17.221
Are last names
even allowed?

29:17.223 --> 29:18.756
Maybe that wasn't
so discreet.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.324
So yeah,
just Gloria.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.993
Call me
and we'll go on a date.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.495
Bye!

29:25.930 --> 29:28.799
Okay, that went well.

29:28.801 --> 29:30.667
Thanks for the support.

29:31.870 --> 29:34.938
What do you mean
I didn't leave my number?

29:34.940 --> 29:36.740
Damn it!

29:36.742 --> 29:38.809
( phone ringing )

29:47.719 --> 29:48.685
Hello?

29:48.687 --> 29:50.254
Matt:
<i>Is-- is that Gloria?</i>

29:50.256 --> 29:51.355
Who?

29:51.357 --> 29:54.224
Oh, yes.
Yes, it is.

29:54.226 --> 29:57.594
<i>This is Matt,</i>
<i>you just called me?</i>

29:57.596 --> 29:58.629
So I did.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.697
But I didn't leave
my number.

30:00.699 --> 30:02.866
<i>Oh, it came up</i>
<i>on my phone.</i>

30:02.868 --> 30:06.603
Oh, cool.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.972
<i>You sound really great.</i>

30:08.974 --> 30:10.974
- Thanks.
-  <i>So...</i>

30:10.976 --> 30:16.914
<i>would you like to meet</i>
<i>somewhere or something?</i>

30:16.916 --> 30:18.282
Sure.

30:18.284 --> 30:21.985
How about 12:30

30:21.987 --> 30:24.488
at Añejo on 28th?

30:24.490 --> 30:27.224
It's very nice,
very atmospheric

30:27.226 --> 30:29.092
and very public.

30:29.094 --> 30:31.428
<i>Well, I don't want</i>
<i>too public.</i>

30:31.430 --> 30:32.963
No, no.
Of course.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.966
Well, it's not so public
that you would be outed,

30:35.968 --> 30:37.568
but public enough
that you wouldn't be able

30:37.570 --> 30:39.303
to kill me
without witnesses.

30:39.305 --> 30:42.506
<i>Okay. Okay, well,</i>
<i>that sounds good.</i>

30:42.508 --> 30:45.642
Okay, great, bye.

30:48.746 --> 30:53.717
What does one wear
to expose a cheater?

30:53.719 --> 30:55.385
Not that.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.087
( gasps )
Jesus!

30:57.089 --> 30:59.790
You scared
the crap out of me.

30:59.792 --> 31:01.358
How long have you
been standing there?

31:01.360 --> 31:03.694
No time at all.
I was just about to knock.

31:03.696 --> 31:06.496
Look, I just wanted
to apologize

31:06.498 --> 31:07.631
about what I said
the other day

31:07.633 --> 31:09.099
about you not
being relaxed.

31:09.101 --> 31:12.269
You're right,
I don't know you

31:12.271 --> 31:14.605
and I shouldn't have
judged.

31:14.607 --> 31:16.540
I'm Cy.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.810
Okay, well,
apology accepted, I guess.

31:19.812 --> 31:21.245
Carrie.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.881
I thought maybe
I could invite you

31:23.883 --> 31:25.015
to dinner or something.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.283
- What for?
- I don't know,

31:26.285 --> 31:27.284
I thought it might be fun.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.685
- Fun?
- Yeah, fun.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.287
You've heard
of the concept?

31:30.289 --> 31:32.422
I'm familiar
with it, yeah.

31:32.424 --> 31:35.025
One of the things
that people do

31:35.027 --> 31:37.561
and they indulge in it
to divert themselves

31:37.563 --> 31:39.763
from the true realities
of existence.

31:39.765 --> 31:41.398
Well, look--

31:41.400 --> 31:43.066
If you ever feel like
leaving your apartment--

31:43.068 --> 31:45.836
- Just--
- What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

31:45.838 --> 31:47.237
Nothing, just--

31:47.239 --> 31:49.039
You have a reputation
around here

31:49.041 --> 31:51.408
for being a bit
of a hermit.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.910
Is that right?

31:52.912 --> 31:54.311
Well, if you don't mind,

31:54.313 --> 31:56.179
I'm actually just going
now to meet someone.

31:56.181 --> 31:57.648
A male someone.

31:57.650 --> 32:00.284
See how I'm leaving
the apartment?

32:00.286 --> 32:01.518
I see, yeah.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.786
You might want
to spread the word.

32:02.788 --> 32:04.087
Oh, I'll definitely
do that.

32:04.089 --> 32:05.055
Good.

32:06.391 --> 32:07.691
And Carrie--

32:09.527 --> 32:11.962
got some lipstick
on your teeth.

32:11.964 --> 32:14.731
( scoffs )

32:14.733 --> 32:16.633
I hate it
when that happens.

32:24.008 --> 32:25.776
Hey, party of one?

32:25.778 --> 32:29.112
No, actually, two.
I'm meeting someone.

32:29.114 --> 32:33.216
Really?
Like, a man?

32:33.218 --> 32:35.919
Yeah, a man.

32:35.921 --> 32:37.020
Okay, cool.

32:37.022 --> 32:38.622
Just look around
and see if he's here.

32:38.624 --> 32:43.994
Well, I haven't actually
met him before.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.762
I see.

32:45.764 --> 32:48.699
But I know his name.
It's Matt.

32:48.701 --> 32:49.900
Matt.

32:49.902 --> 32:52.602
Yeah, I think
I know who he is.

32:54.539 --> 32:57.774
- Uh, um--
- Gloria--

32:57.776 --> 32:59.042
Sorry.

32:59.044 --> 33:00.010
That's okay.

33:01.879 --> 33:03.146
( chuckles )

33:05.216 --> 33:07.017
There.

33:07.019 --> 33:09.286
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.054
Hi.

33:12.190 --> 33:14.725
( clears throat )

33:14.727 --> 33:17.394
Wow.

33:17.396 --> 33:20.897
You're just, uh...

33:22.800 --> 33:26.269
You're much more beautiful
than I had expected.

33:26.271 --> 33:28.171
Am I?

33:28.173 --> 33:29.940
Yeah, I thought
I would only get

33:29.942 --> 33:31.375
desperate ogresses

33:31.377 --> 33:33.577
applying to an ad
in the "Village Rag,"

33:33.579 --> 33:35.712
let alone a woman
who's into literature.

33:35.714 --> 33:37.981
How did you know
I'm into literature?

33:37.983 --> 33:39.383
Gloria Patch...

33:39.385 --> 33:42.886
from Fitzgerald's
underrated masterpiece,

33:42.888 --> 33:45.322
"The Beautiful
and the Damned"?

33:46.357 --> 33:48.091
Okay.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.060
I'm a massive geek, sorry.

33:50.062 --> 33:53.797
Oh, don't be sorry.
You won't beat me for geekdom.

33:53.799 --> 33:56.366
I'll take that challenge.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.801
- You're on.
- Okay.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.971
Should we order
some drinks?

34:00.973 --> 34:05.442
I'll just stick to water.
Not to be a spoilsport.

34:05.444 --> 34:09.379
No, actually,
I don't drink either.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.081
I never saw
the point of it.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.516
Oh, well, in my case,
it would be illegal.

34:13.518 --> 34:18.088
Really?
How-- how old are you?

34:18.090 --> 34:21.224
- Nineteen.
- Wow.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.993
So, you--
you're a student?

34:22.995 --> 34:25.462
Ex. I graduated
Harvard last year.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.297
No way,
I went to M.I.T.

34:27.299 --> 34:30.367
- Did you?
- Mathematics.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.502
Hang on,
so you must have been 18

34:32.504 --> 34:33.703
when you graduated?

34:33.705 --> 34:36.973
That math degree
came in handy, huh?

34:36.975 --> 34:39.576
Well, that was a little thing
called subtraction.

34:39.578 --> 34:42.411
Have you guys decided?

34:42.414 --> 34:46.183
I'll just--
a quesadilla with water.

34:46.185 --> 34:50.520
And I'll have a diet Coke
and a cheese enchilada.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.522
Great.
I'll take your menus.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.658
Coming up.

34:54.659 --> 34:56.393
A diet Coke?

34:56.395 --> 34:58.695
Yeah, I'm just trying

34:58.697 --> 35:01.665
to keep the weight off
before the...

35:02.834 --> 35:06.269
Yeah, so, I'm surprised

35:06.271 --> 35:09.072
that someone from Harvard
reads the personals.

35:10.007 --> 35:12.242
How else
should I find a man?

35:12.244 --> 35:13.643
Wait for our eyes
to meet

35:13.645 --> 35:15.112
while trying to solve
Fermat's theorem?

35:15.114 --> 35:19.116
Well, Fermat's
was already solved in 1994.

35:19.118 --> 35:21.084
Well, one nil to you.

35:21.086 --> 35:22.018
( chuckles )

35:22.020 --> 35:23.887
- Asshat.
- Shit for brains.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.656
Woman:
<i>Dwayne, Joshua...</i>

35:26.658 --> 35:29.126
I just used
to get called dork.

35:29.128 --> 35:31.795
We actually had a kid
whose last name was Dork.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.763
But it didn't
really hurt him, though.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.732
He was way
too good-looking.

35:35.734 --> 35:39.035
Well, luckily, he didn't have
a first name like Dick.

35:39.037 --> 35:41.972
It was Dick,
his first name.

35:41.974 --> 35:44.908
Dick Dork was a person's name
that you knew?

35:44.910 --> 35:46.843
- Dick Dork.
- Well, I'm gonna have to come
to your apartment

35:46.845 --> 35:48.111
and look at your yearbooks

35:48.113 --> 35:50.413
to make sure
you're not lying to me.

35:50.415 --> 35:51.414
Oh, yeah?

35:51.416 --> 35:52.782
Yeah.

35:54.051 --> 35:56.086
Was it just me
or did you find

35:56.088 --> 35:57.954
everyone in high school
stultifying?

35:57.956 --> 36:00.824
Yes, in fact
if you used that word,

36:00.826 --> 36:02.392
"stultifying,"
in front of them,

36:02.394 --> 36:03.760
they would have shouted
SAT word!

36:03.762 --> 36:05.962
- SAT word!
- Yes.

36:05.964 --> 36:08.031
- I remember that.
- Yeah?

36:08.033 --> 36:11.234
And the teachers
were lousy too.

36:11.236 --> 36:12.536
Well, actually,

36:12.538 --> 36:14.304
two of them
are coming to my wedding.

36:17.475 --> 36:19.109
( clears throat )

36:20.745 --> 36:22.646
What are you doing?

36:22.648 --> 36:23.847
Oh, nothing,
I was just playing

36:23.849 --> 36:25.382
- with my napkin--
- No, no, no.

36:25.384 --> 36:29.052
What are you doing here?
I mean, what's with the ad?

36:29.054 --> 36:31.188
Oh, uh...

36:34.992 --> 36:38.528
My fiancée
and I got together

36:38.530 --> 36:40.330
when we were
really young,

36:40.332 --> 36:41.631
and I love her.

36:41.633 --> 36:44.000
I do, but I--

36:45.703 --> 36:47.771
I just sometimes think
something's missing,

36:47.773 --> 36:52.609
and I don't wanna do
the wrong thing,

36:52.611 --> 36:58.615
so I'm just
looking for clarity.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.951
Does that make any sense

37:00.953 --> 37:03.053
or do I just sound like
a total dick?

37:03.055 --> 37:05.855
The two aren't necessarily
mutually exclusive.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.591
When's the big day?

37:07.593 --> 37:09.392
February 4th.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.561
Oh, excuse me!

37:11.563 --> 37:12.662
Hey!

37:12.664 --> 37:14.798
( coughs )
I'm choking!

37:14.800 --> 37:18.535
Oh, I thought
you didn't drink.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.770
and I thought
you'd be a creep.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.172
Would that have helped?

37:22.174 --> 37:23.773
Frankly, yes.

37:23.775 --> 37:27.577
I came here with the intention
of exposing you.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.613
What do you mean?

37:29.615 --> 37:31.214
I read your ad,

37:31.216 --> 37:34.251
and as a member
of the female gender

37:34.253 --> 37:36.720
and people
with integrity everywhere,

37:36.722 --> 37:38.121
it pissed me off.

37:38.123 --> 37:40.523
So, I thought
I'd make a date with you,

37:40.525 --> 37:42.058
find out about
your girlfriend,

37:42.060 --> 37:44.194
and then tell her
she's about to marry a cheat.

37:44.196 --> 37:45.862
- Oh, my God.
- What do you expect?

37:45.864 --> 37:47.364
You're getting married
in two months,

37:47.366 --> 37:49.499
you're trying to meet girls
in classified ads.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.801
- That--
- I thought I'd find
a narcissistic rat bag,

37:51.803 --> 37:56.773
not some handsome,
charming, smart--

37:56.775 --> 37:58.808
you need to be
honest with her.

37:58.810 --> 38:01.845
I know, I know.
You're right and I--

38:01.847 --> 38:04.281
I just want
to be clear about

38:04.283 --> 38:06.983
how I'm feeling
before I do that.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.985
Are you clearer now?

38:11.555 --> 38:13.290
No.

38:17.161 --> 38:19.129
Well, I'm glad
to have helped.

38:19.131 --> 38:24.167
Good luck
with the nuptials...

38:24.169 --> 38:26.503
I guess.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.004
Or not.

38:31.942 --> 38:33.643
Woman:
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

38:33.645 --> 38:34.944
You liked him,
didn't you?

38:34.946 --> 38:37.013
Whether I did or not
is irrelevant.

38:37.015 --> 38:39.215
He's engaged.
And that is that.

38:39.217 --> 38:42.052
You should definitely
see him again.

38:42.054 --> 38:44.621
What is it about
the word <i>engaged</i>

38:44.623 --> 38:47.324
- that you don't get?
- He's not even married yet.

38:47.326 --> 38:48.291
What's the problem?

38:48.293 --> 38:50.327
Even if he were married,
who cares?

38:50.329 --> 38:51.328
I care!

38:51.330 --> 38:52.329
I try very hard

38:52.331 --> 38:53.997
not to be engaged
in activities

38:53.999 --> 38:55.899
that are harmful
to myself or others.

38:55.901 --> 38:57.834
Okay, you don't think
it's gonna hurt you

38:57.836 --> 39:00.737
to not get to hang out
with someone you like?

39:00.739 --> 39:02.972
You don't think
it hurts to deny yourself

39:02.974 --> 39:04.607
the possibility of love?

39:06.010 --> 39:08.845
Okay, next time
you see Matt,

39:08.847 --> 39:10.680
ask him
his fiancée's middle name.

39:10.682 --> 39:13.583
There won't be
a next time.

39:13.585 --> 39:14.851
Why?

39:14.853 --> 39:16.920
Because guys
don't usually

39:16.922 --> 39:18.688
pay attention
to details like that.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.891
But if they're in love,
they do.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.060
They've been
together forever,

39:24.062 --> 39:25.662
of course he's gonna know
her middle name.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.297
So, it's a good test
then, isn't it?

39:27.299 --> 39:30.166
And if he doesn't know it,
I'd say he's fair game.

39:30.168 --> 39:33.403
Yo, yo, yo.
What's up?

39:33.405 --> 39:35.238
What are you guys--
what are you talking about?

39:35.240 --> 39:38.641
Oh, you know,
clothes, makeup, boys.

39:38.643 --> 39:40.310
Hmm.
Sorry I missed that.

39:40.312 --> 39:45.215
So, are you going to see
the <i>legend</i> tomorrow night?

39:45.217 --> 39:46.549
Who?

39:46.551 --> 39:51.921
My recently ex-boyfriend
is playing a gig at Natto's.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.990
Why is he your ex?

39:53.992 --> 39:56.926
Because he chose
to go off with some whore,

39:56.928 --> 39:58.261
that's why.

39:58.263 --> 40:00.497
And she is so not
his type.

40:00.499 --> 40:03.333
Yeah, he much prefers sluts
to whores.

40:04.869 --> 40:07.036
What's his name?

40:07.038 --> 40:09.639
His name is Dex
and he's a jerk.

40:09.641 --> 40:13.009
But he's amazing.

40:13.011 --> 40:16.112
Like, his tongue
should be registered

40:16.114 --> 40:17.313
as a national treasure.

40:17.315 --> 40:18.448
( chokes )

40:18.450 --> 40:20.016
Hey, you should come.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.851
Douglas:
<i>You-- you should totally go.</i>

40:21.853 --> 40:25.021
Sure, why not?

40:25.023 --> 40:28.091
Hey,
that's my philosophy too.

40:29.193 --> 40:31.227
Thank you so much
for going.

40:31.229 --> 40:34.397
I cannot watch
another Dex show.

40:34.399 --> 40:39.068
<i>♪ Never really</i>
<i>felt bad about it ♪</i>

40:39.070 --> 40:43.940
<i>♪ As we drank deep</i>
<i>from the lie ♪</i>

40:43.942 --> 40:46.810
<i>♪ 'Cause I felt</i>
<i>melting magnets... ♪</i>

40:46.812 --> 40:48.878
Uh, hi.
Vodka, straight up.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.047
Actually,
what's the one

40:51.049 --> 40:52.382
all
the sorority girls drink,

40:52.384 --> 40:53.817
the one that makes
you really drunk?

40:53.819 --> 40:56.219
- Oh, rum.
- Rum, double.

40:56.221 --> 40:57.253
I.D.?

40:57.255 --> 41:00.256
Can I-- can I give you
my I.Q. instead?

41:00.258 --> 41:01.391
185?

41:01.393 --> 41:03.126
Surely I can be
better trusted with alcohol

41:03.128 --> 41:05.328
than older,
less intelligent people.

41:05.330 --> 41:06.529
Are you 21?

41:08.032 --> 41:10.099
Alcohol
is an organic compound

41:10.101 --> 41:12.268
in which the hydroxyl group
is bound to a carbon atom

41:12.270 --> 41:14.103
so that the chemical makeup
of the ethanol

41:14.105 --> 41:15.472
in your slightly
toxic wares

41:15.474 --> 41:17.574
is C2H 5OH.

41:17.576 --> 41:18.908
I think I can handle it.

41:18.910 --> 41:22.946
- Hey, just lie.
- I'm not a liar.

41:22.948 --> 41:24.414
Well, he's not going
to give you a drink

41:24.416 --> 41:25.648
unless you do.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.151
Well, you know what?
Morality is inconvenient.

41:28.153 --> 41:31.187
Coke, please.
Regular, not that diet shit.

41:32.289 --> 41:33.490
Okay,
you're feisty tonight.

41:33.492 --> 41:34.624
I like it.

41:34.626 --> 41:35.959
But at least let me,
like...

41:35.961 --> 41:37.427
- ( muttering )
- Wait, can--

41:37.429 --> 41:40.930
Why can't people
just like me for who I am?

41:40.932 --> 41:43.032
Nobody likes anybody
for who they are.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.734
That's why
we have to pretend

41:44.736 --> 41:46.236
<i>to be better</i>
<i>than who we are</i>

41:46.238 --> 41:48.338
and then let people
find out the truth later,

41:48.340 --> 41:50.073
you know,
once they've already invested.

41:50.075 --> 41:51.741
That makes you
sound like a psychopath.

41:51.743 --> 41:54.143
<i>Okay, well--</i>

41:54.145 --> 41:55.745
Mm. It's spiked.

41:55.747 --> 41:58.581
Wow, looks like
she is a genius.

41:58.583 --> 42:02.318
Finally,
the recognition
I've been craving.

42:02.320 --> 42:05.121
Maybe--
maybe that was a move.

42:05.123 --> 42:08.291
I don't get why people
are so sex obsessed.

42:08.293 --> 42:09.826
It's like
a national epidemic.

42:09.828 --> 42:12.896
Because sex
is freaking fantastic.

42:12.898 --> 42:14.531
It's not that great.

42:14.533 --> 42:17.100
The kissing part maybe,
but the main event

42:17.102 --> 42:18.568
is nothing to be
obsessed about.

42:18.570 --> 42:19.802
Yes, I win!

42:19.804 --> 42:21.204
I knew you
weren't a virgin.

42:21.206 --> 42:22.505
What do you mean
"you win"?

42:22.507 --> 42:25.275
- Win what?
- Just a bet with Dougie.

42:25.277 --> 42:27.143
<i>About my virginity?</i>

42:27.145 --> 42:29.012
It's not about your virginity,
okay?

42:29.014 --> 42:31.314
I made some money.
Be happy for me.

42:31.316 --> 42:34.617
Your problem is
you haven't had sex
with the right person.

42:34.619 --> 42:37.520
There's a lot
of good, clean sex
going on out there.

42:37.522 --> 42:40.390
And by clean,
I mean dirty, okay?

42:40.392 --> 42:42.525
And just because people
like to do it,

42:42.527 --> 42:44.294
doesn't mean
that they're obsessed.

42:44.296 --> 42:46.162
Do you think people
are sleep obsessed

42:46.164 --> 42:48.131
because they like
to sleep every day?

42:48.133 --> 42:50.199
You have to sleep
for survival.

42:50.201 --> 42:52.569
Some people
screw for survival!

42:52.571 --> 42:54.938
Sleep obsession
doesn't hurt anyone!

42:54.940 --> 42:56.239
Neither does sex,

42:56.241 --> 42:59.075
if it's between
two consenting adults.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.844
The Victorians
forced people

43:01.846 --> 43:04.380
to deny
their natural desires--

43:04.382 --> 43:07.350
Shouldn't our natural desires
sometimes be denied?

43:07.352 --> 43:09.352
Like, what if
your natural desire

43:09.354 --> 43:11.588
is to step on a baby?

43:11.590 --> 43:14.624
Okay, yeah,
you-- you have a point.

43:14.626 --> 43:17.427
- Like, stepping on babies...
- Bad!

43:17.429 --> 43:19.162
...should be avoided
at all costs.

43:19.164 --> 43:22.332
I just think
that people make
an awful lot of excuses

43:22.334 --> 43:24.233
to indulge
in bad behavior

43:24.235 --> 43:26.769
on the pretext that
"I wanted to do it,"

43:26.771 --> 43:30.006
or "if we're discreet,
it won't hurt anyone."

43:30.008 --> 43:31.808
Humans are hypocrites.

43:31.810 --> 43:35.578
And that's what makes us
so bloody interesting.

43:35.580 --> 43:36.779
( chuckles )

43:36.781 --> 43:38.348
What language was that?

43:38.350 --> 43:41.918
That's how you speak.
That's how you come off.

43:41.920 --> 43:43.686
You should know that
about yourself.

43:47.257 --> 43:50.326
Oh, my God.
What is this?

43:50.328 --> 43:51.995
Is this a bucket list?

43:51.997 --> 43:54.464
You aren't dying,
are you?

43:54.466 --> 43:56.532
Because I do not have
the emotional maturity

43:56.534 --> 43:58.401
to deal with
a terminal friend right now.

43:58.403 --> 44:00.236
It's not a bucket list.

44:00.238 --> 44:02.305
Then what is it?

44:02.307 --> 44:05.174
I see a therapist.

44:05.176 --> 44:08.711
He made it for me
to help me be happier.

44:08.713 --> 44:11.080
Oh, honey, you don't need
a list for that.

44:11.082 --> 44:12.548
I'll help you.

44:12.550 --> 44:14.250
Okay, I'm having
a New Year's Eve Party,

44:14.252 --> 44:15.251
for one thing.

44:15.253 --> 44:16.719
You should definitely come.

44:16.721 --> 44:20.189
Also, you should call up
that bad boy from the paper

44:20.191 --> 44:22.025
and give him
the bang of his life.

44:22.027 --> 44:23.426
He'll leave that twit
he's with,

44:23.428 --> 44:24.927
and you'll never be
lonely again.

44:24.929 --> 44:26.029
Do you seriously
think that?

44:26.031 --> 44:27.330
It's not your job

44:27.332 --> 44:29.465
to be
everyone's moral guardian.

44:29.467 --> 44:32.669
If you like the guy,
that's between you and him.

44:32.671 --> 44:35.004
- <i>( feedback buzzes )</i>
<i>- He's the one</i>
<i>with the fiancée.</i>

44:35.006 --> 44:36.673
That's for him
to deal with.

44:36.675 --> 44:38.875
Not you.

44:38.877 --> 44:40.877
Ooh, there he is.
Okay, okay.

44:40.879 --> 44:42.078
Do they say, like,

44:42.080 --> 44:44.914
"Get off the stage
and do me?"

44:44.916 --> 44:47.417
Yes, but not
in a good way.

44:47.419 --> 44:49.986
How can it not be
in a good way?

I've got the ticket

49:34.272 --> 49:36.038
To London?

49:36.040 --> 49:37.606
But that's

49:46.985 --> 49:48.818
We have to adapt.

But why?

49:49.887 --> 49:51.487

you gonna tell me?

49:51.489 --> 49:53.756
And when are you
ever gonna stop lying?

49:53.758 --> 49:55.691
I thought it was
too long a conversation

49:55.693 --> 49:58.694

and so I decided

49:58.696 --> 50:00.529
- I'll wait till you--
-  <i>And then what?</i>

50:00.531 --> 50:02.465

the perfect time to tell me

50:02.467 --> 50:04.367
that you're abandoning
our Christmas tradition

50:04.369 --> 50:06.135

you're shagging,

50:06.137 --> 50:08.637

you were getting married.

<i>♪ And we're perfect</i>

54:58.963 --> 55:00.663
<i>♪ Just like you...</i>

55:00.665 --> 55:02.831
Wait, stop.

55:03.733 --> 55:05.634
She spelled "too" wrong.

55:05.636 --> 55:08.437
<i>♪ You make me</i>
<i>so happy... ♪</i>

55:08.439 --> 55:10.105
<i>Uh--</i>

55:12.208 --> 55:14.109
Yeah...

55:14.111 --> 55:16.912
Yeah,
she's a terrible speller.

55:16.914 --> 55:18.280
Let's--
why don't we

55:18.282 --> 55:22.117
just close our eyes
and just try to relax?

55:22.119 --> 55:23.519
Okay?

55:25.021 --> 55:27.289
Oh-- I--
I feel dizzy.

55:27.291 --> 55:28.590
Okay.

55:31.194 --> 55:33.462
I knew we shouldn't have tried
to do this at my place.

55:33.464 --> 55:38.567
All the photos and stuff
are a real mood killer.

55:42.772 --> 55:45.507
You know what else
is a mood killer?

55:45.509 --> 55:48.077
Having a fiancée.

55:48.945 --> 55:53.015
Get-- my--
( mumbles )

55:53.017 --> 55:54.850
How are you going
to say vows,

55:54.852 --> 55:56.552
sacred vows
in front of everyone you know,

55:56.554 --> 55:59.855
that you will honor and love
and cherish this woman,

55:59.857 --> 56:01.290
<i>forsaking all others,</i>

56:01.292 --> 56:03.826
<i>when you clearly</i>
<i>don't respect her,</i>

56:03.828 --> 56:07.329
which is the foundation
of all of those things?

56:07.331 --> 56:09.998
You're not going
to leave her, are you?

56:10.000 --> 56:12.735
I--
I really like you.

56:12.737 --> 56:15.971
I really think
we could be good together.

56:15.973 --> 56:18.941
<i>You deserve</i>
<i>to be stimulated by someone</i>

56:18.943 --> 56:21.110
who's on equal footing
with you, and so do I.

56:21.112 --> 56:23.712
Then end this facade
of an engagement.

56:23.714 --> 56:25.714
I will!

56:25.716 --> 56:27.583
I mean, you know,
I might.

56:27.585 --> 56:28.784
I just met you!

56:28.786 --> 56:31.453
Not for me!
For you, for her!

56:33.390 --> 56:36.225
Look, I thought
that you wanted this.

56:36.227 --> 56:38.026
Just because
you want something,

56:38.028 --> 56:40.362
doesn't make it right.

56:40.364 --> 56:42.331
Oh, Jesus, Pollyanna.

56:42.333 --> 56:43.532
This is real life.

56:43.534 --> 56:45.534
Real life
is complicated.

56:45.536 --> 56:48.170
Don't be such a child.

56:52.876 --> 56:54.176
Professor Harrison:
<i>I think this has been</i>

56:54.178 --> 56:55.411
<i>my best semester ever,</i>
<i>Carrie.</i>

56:56.579 --> 56:58.847
Me too.

56:58.849 --> 57:01.884
Oh, I forgot,
I have something for you.

57:01.886 --> 57:03.619
Oh, yeah?

57:03.621 --> 57:04.887
Mmm-hmm.

57:04.889 --> 57:06.155
It's um--

57:06.157 --> 57:10.058
it's more of a loan
than a gift.

57:14.664 --> 57:16.198
I thought
you might like to read

57:16.200 --> 57:19.101
the first edition version.

57:19.103 --> 57:20.736
But, I need it back

57:20.738 --> 57:25.107
because it's really special
to me.

57:25.109 --> 57:27.976
How sweet, thank you.

57:27.978 --> 57:32.114
I promise I'll take
good care of it.

57:32.116 --> 57:35.617
You make me happy,
you know that?

57:35.619 --> 57:37.820
You make me happy too.

57:37.822 --> 57:39.421
Um...

57:41.424 --> 57:45.894
You know
what would really,
really make me happy?

57:45.896 --> 57:49.364
What's that?

57:49.366 --> 57:54.269
If you could say
this one thing for me...

57:54.271 --> 57:56.438
What thing?

57:58.508 --> 58:00.409
( whispering )

58:06.683 --> 58:08.450
I can't say that.

58:08.452 --> 58:10.085
Why not?

58:10.087 --> 58:13.222
Come on,
you're such a quick learner.

58:13.224 --> 58:16.058
And it's just
one little thing.

58:16.060 --> 58:17.359
You only have
to say it once.

58:17.361 --> 58:20.462
You can--
I mean, you can start slow.

58:20.464 --> 58:24.066
It won't sound right.
It won't sound like me.

58:24.068 --> 58:25.801
Sure it will.

58:25.803 --> 58:27.636
Just say it.

58:32.008 --> 58:34.343
What do you want?

58:34.345 --> 58:36.745
I...

58:40.717 --> 58:44.253
I can't.
It's too embarrassing.

58:49.592 --> 58:51.226
Are you serious?

58:51.228 --> 58:53.962
Why can't you
just do what I ask?

58:53.964 --> 58:55.297
Because I don't want to.

58:55.299 --> 58:57.366
And frankly,
I find it a bit demeaning.

58:57.368 --> 58:59.101
It's not demeaning,
it's fun.

58:59.103 --> 59:01.603
Not for me, it isn't.

59:01.605 --> 59:05.307
You know what?
I tried.

59:05.309 --> 59:07.509
But if you can't just do
this one thing for me, then--

59:07.511 --> 59:08.577
Then what?

59:08.579 --> 59:10.546
Jesus, David,
why are you acting like

59:10.548 --> 59:12.014
such psycho about this?

59:12.016 --> 59:14.950
Don't be such
a child, Carrie.

59:14.952 --> 59:17.653
I'll call you a cab.

59:22.659 --> 59:25.561
( phone rings )

59:29.799 --> 59:31.500
( clatters )

59:33.469 --> 59:35.337
Shit!

59:52.855 --> 59:54.156
No!

59:54.991 --> 59:58.060
No, no, no, no.

59:58.062 --> 01:00:00.128
( exclaims )

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.530
Katherine!

01:00:01.532 --> 01:00:03.365
Ugh!

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:04.933
I'm sorry!

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:06.902
( whimpers )

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:20.515
I don't understand.

01:00:20.517 --> 01:00:22.918
I need you
to take him back.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.419
We can't accept returns.

01:00:24.421 --> 01:00:27.255
He's all alone.
I can't do that to him.

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:29.124
And you're the one
that told me

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.292
that fish were social.

01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:31.760
I already
killed his friend,

01:00:31.762 --> 01:00:32.761
I don't wanna kill him
too.

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:33.929
You killed who?

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:35.931
Katherine.
It was an accident.

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:37.232
Did you eat her?

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:40.602
What? No.
What?

01:00:40.604 --> 01:00:44.272
Lots of people
eat goldfish on dares.

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:47.409
That is insane.
Please, take him back.

01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:49.211
But don't let anyone
eat him.

01:00:49.213 --> 01:00:51.079
I told you.
No refunds or returns.

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:52.614
I don't want
my money back.

01:00:52.616 --> 01:00:55.050
Just have a heart,
it's Christmas Eve.

01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:56.551
Oh...

01:00:56.553 --> 01:00:58.253
Store policy.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.358
Hey, hey,
what are you doing?

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.128
Be free!
Make friends!

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.396
Have a life.

01:01:07.398 --> 01:01:09.998
You can't do that.
Take him back.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.200
I don't know
which one is which.

01:01:12.202 --> 01:01:14.569
( chuckles )
I'm calling my manager.

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:22.477
Merry Christmas,
Spencer.

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:49.938
( shouts )

01:02:00.249 --> 01:02:02.017
( screams )

01:02:06.022 --> 01:02:07.689
<i>( knocking on window )</i>

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:11.927
<i>( knocking continues )</i>

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:17.099
Is everything okay?

01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:18.333
What?

01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:20.168
I heard screaming.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:23.839
Oh, no!
That was the television.

01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:26.341
Oh, okay.

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:30.645
Has your roommate
put you outside again?

01:02:30.647 --> 01:02:33.081
Yeah,
but if you don't want me to,

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.783
- I could--
- Oh, no, that's fine.

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:36.084
You go ahead.

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:38.854
I'll be here...

01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:40.255
obviously.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:41.757
Hey, hey, hey.

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.564
Do you want
to go for a walk?

01:02:49.566 --> 01:02:52.234
I mean,
it is Christmas Eve.

01:02:52.236 --> 01:02:54.636
Normal people
don't like to spend it alone.

01:02:54.638 --> 01:02:57.472
How would you know
what normal people do?

01:02:57.474 --> 01:03:00.408
That's just what I'm told.

01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:03.578
Don't you have to practice
blowing indeterminate sounds

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:04.880
out of a large piece
of wood?

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:09.684
I could do with a break.

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:12.821
So, do you live alone?

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:15.090
- I do.
- Lucky girl.

01:03:15.092 --> 01:03:17.526
My roommate
Ted is insane.

01:03:17.528 --> 01:03:19.394
- Really?
- He barely says a word.

01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:21.963
And when he does speak,
it's invariably to lie.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.231
It's actually incredible.

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.367
I've never met anyone
like him.

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:28.036
How long
have you lived there?

01:03:28.038 --> 01:03:29.337
A few months.

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:31.740
I was roughing it,
living in a basement

01:03:31.742 --> 01:03:33.241
down in South Jersey
for a while,

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:35.177
just waiting
till I got a job

01:03:35.179 --> 01:03:36.344
so I could move
to the city.

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:37.712
I didn't want
to come here

01:03:37.714 --> 01:03:39.581
and be owing money
to friends,

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:41.716
or having to live
with four annoying roommates.

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:44.486
- You know?
- Now you just have
one annoying roommate?

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:47.055
( chuckles )
That's a victory
from where I'm standing.

01:03:48.457 --> 01:03:50.959
And you actually
have a job

01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:52.394
playing the didgeridoo?

01:03:52.396 --> 01:03:53.595
There can't be
too many of them

01:03:53.597 --> 01:03:55.297
- going around.
- Well, I don't

01:03:55.299 --> 01:03:56.598
just play the didgeridoo.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.732
Oh, what else
do you play?

01:03:57.734 --> 01:04:00.769
Just some
other instruments.

01:04:00.771 --> 01:04:02.470
Like what?

01:04:02.472 --> 01:04:04.139
You really want to know?

01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:06.007
Otherwise
I wouldn't be asking.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:09.144
Okay, let's see...

01:04:09.146 --> 01:04:12.948
Flute, clarinet,
trumpet, trombone, tuba,

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:16.384
saxophone, guitar, piano,
drums, bassoon,

01:04:16.386 --> 01:04:19.221
harmonica,
and the triangle.

01:04:19.223 --> 01:04:21.056
I'm actually pretty killer
on the triangle.

01:04:21.058 --> 01:04:22.557
And the didgeridoo.

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:24.626
I'm still learning that one,
but yeah.

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:27.229
Did you study music
in college?

01:04:27.231 --> 01:04:29.431
Yeah, at Berklee.

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:35.570
Do you like music?

01:04:35.572 --> 01:04:40.108
I'd be a weird person
if I didn't like music.

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:41.576
I used to listen
to old records

01:04:41.578 --> 01:04:45.013
at my grandmother's
when I was a kid.

01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:46.581
I was actually
quite odd

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.250
when I was younger,
you know.

01:04:48.252 --> 01:04:49.851
Impossible.

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:54.222
<i>( bell dinging )</i>

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:58.026
Who's
your favorite musician?

01:04:58.028 --> 01:05:00.095
John Coltrane
at the moment.

01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:01.096
Nice.

01:05:01.098 --> 01:05:02.898
You heard of him?

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.266
He's kind of famous.

01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:05.500
You'd be surprised
by how many people

01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:07.235
have never said that.

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:09.004
Knowledge
is kind of my thing.

01:05:09.006 --> 01:05:10.505
Oh, yeah?

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:12.474
So, were you
one of those head-down

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:14.442
academic types
in high school?

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:16.177
You could say that, yeah.

01:05:16.179 --> 01:05:19.014
And I'll bet
you were in every
after school society.

01:05:19.016 --> 01:05:20.248
Not every one.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:23.852
Just Harvard
Model Congress,

01:05:23.854 --> 01:05:29.190
Excellent Exegists,
Mathletes, College Bowl.

01:05:29.192 --> 01:05:31.426
Wow.
You really were a nerd.

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:34.362
Well, that's something
coming from a band geek.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:35.964
Touché.

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:43.505
What's your actual job?

01:05:43.507 --> 01:05:47.108
I play, um...

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:50.145
I play clarinet
for the New York Philharmonic.

01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:51.346
But I mean,
I just started,

01:05:51.348 --> 01:05:52.514
so it's-- it's nothing.

01:05:52.516 --> 01:05:53.715
That's incredible.

01:05:53.717 --> 01:05:56.484
Your parents
must be so proud of you.

01:05:56.486 --> 01:06:00.088
You know, you'd have thought
they would be,

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:03.024
but the truth is they really
don't get it at all.

01:06:03.026 --> 01:06:04.826
My...

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:05.827
my dad wanted me

01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:08.229
to do
something more practical,

01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:09.497
I guess.

01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:11.032
Ever since
I tried to explain to him

01:06:11.034 --> 01:06:12.634
that music's my thing,
he pretty much refuses

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:15.904
to engage
in any discussion about it.

01:06:15.906 --> 01:06:17.706
That's awful.

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:21.743
How do you deal
with that?

01:06:21.745 --> 01:06:23.712
I don't know.
I didn't for a long time.

01:06:23.714 --> 01:06:24.946
And then one day
I just thought,

01:06:24.948 --> 01:06:27.849
"Screw this," you know?

01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:32.120
I have one life
and I'm allowed to be happy.

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:34.356
You know?

01:06:34.358 --> 01:06:36.358
He'll come around
if he comes around.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.792
Yeah.

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:43.498
My dad has
a whole new family.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:48.403
I just hate the feeling
that I've disappointed him.

01:06:48.405 --> 01:06:51.006
Has he disappointed you?

01:06:51.008 --> 01:06:52.741
Mmm-hmm.

01:06:52.743 --> 01:06:55.310
But that doesn't mean
you don't love him, does it?

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:57.579
No, no, no,
of course not.

01:06:57.581 --> 01:06:59.781
So, maybe
it's the same for him?

01:06:59.783 --> 01:07:01.549
I mean,
I'm sure he loves you.

01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:04.152
What's not to love?

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:13.328
So, uh...

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:14.829
what about you?

01:07:14.831 --> 01:07:18.233
- What do you do?
- Oh, proofreader.

01:07:18.235 --> 01:07:19.601
Professional, though.

01:07:19.603 --> 01:07:21.369
Not one of those amateurs
you hear about.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.937
Oh, I'm sure.
I'm sure.

01:07:22.939 --> 01:07:24.873
I'm not like you.

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:26.274
I don't have it
figured out yet.

01:07:26.276 --> 01:07:28.176
Well, when you do,

01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:29.411
I've got a feeling

01:07:29.413 --> 01:07:32.113
you're gonna set the world
alight.

01:07:32.115 --> 01:07:33.748
What makes you say that?

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.984
That's just what
my gut says.

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:42.857
Do you wanna dance?

01:07:42.859 --> 01:07:44.759
No, no.

01:07:44.761 --> 01:07:49.364
I dance like
a rhythmless four-year-old.

01:07:49.366 --> 01:07:50.832
No, no. Seriously.

01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:52.867
You'll have images
you won't ever be able

01:07:52.869 --> 01:07:54.836
to get out of your head,
like when you see

01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:58.106
- a really bad horror movie.
- I love horror movies.

01:07:58.108 --> 01:07:59.507
Seriously, no.

01:07:59.509 --> 01:08:00.975
I won't take no
for an answer.

01:08:00.977 --> 01:08:02.110
Here, come on.

01:08:02.112 --> 01:08:03.545
- Oh...
- Come on.

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:04.913
Okay, okay.
You asked for it.

01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:06.347
All right.

01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:08.083
Here.
Put your arm here.

01:08:08.085 --> 01:08:08.917
( laughs )

01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:11.953
- Are you ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:08:18.394 --> 01:08:20.161
You're freezing.

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:21.296
No, it's okay.

01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:23.298
Here.
Take my coat.

01:08:24.966 --> 01:08:26.201
Thanks.

01:08:30.038 --> 01:08:31.406
Looks good.

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:37.712
Is this yours?

01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:40.982
Yeah, Salinger.
You read it?

01:08:40.984 --> 01:08:45.920
What am I saying?
Of course you have.

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:51.326
Um--
I-- I have to go.

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:54.028
Go where?

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:58.032
There's just something
I have to do really quickly.

01:08:58.033 --> 01:09:00.868
Would you mind
if I borrowed this?

01:09:00.871 --> 01:09:02.470
I'll bring it back
tomorrow.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.439
You're really close by.

01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:05.573
Of course.

01:09:05.575 --> 01:09:07.207
- No problem.
- Thank you.

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:08.776
It's been really nice.

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:11.446
You're not nearly as bad
as I thought you were.

01:09:11.448 --> 01:09:13.814
( laughs )

01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:24.959
( dial tone )

01:09:27.328 --> 01:09:30.231
( dialing )

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:34.135
( phone rings )

01:09:36.538 --> 01:09:39.974
Woman:
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:41.408
<i>Hello?</i>

01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:43.444
Is David there?

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:44.912
<i>Who is this?</i>

01:09:44.915 --> 01:09:46.247
Carrie.

01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:47.615
<i>Who?</i>

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:49.951
Can I just please speak
to David?

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.121
Professor Harrison:
<i>Carrie?</i>

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:55.089
I want my book back.

01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:56.591
<i>What book?</i>

01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:58.193
The one I lent you.

01:09:58.195 --> 01:10:01.229
My first edition
of "Franny and Zooey."

01:10:01.231 --> 01:10:02.830
<i>Yeah, I'm right</i>
<i>in the middle of hosting</i>

01:10:02.832 --> 01:10:04.699
<i>a Christmas party.</i>

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:07.902
<i>Can we discuss this next</i>
<i>month when I get back to my</i>
<i>office?</i>

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:11.406
Could you please just do
this one thing for me?

01:10:11.408 --> 01:10:13.241
<i>Well,</i>
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

01:10:13.243 --> 01:10:15.343
<i>If I find it, I'll be sure</i>
<i>to let you know, okay?</i>

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:17.679
<i>Merry Christmas, Carrie.</i>

01:10:17.681 --> 01:10:19.314
( dial tone )

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.307
Okay...

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:51.879
God...
I'm not going to lie.

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:53.514
I don't really believe
you exist.

01:10:56.218 --> 01:10:57.919
So, I don't really know
what I'm doing,

01:10:57.921 --> 01:11:00.054
or who I'm talking to,

01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:04.392
but anyway,
I just thought I might

01:11:04.394 --> 01:11:07.295
at least let you know
in the unlikely event

01:11:07.297 --> 01:11:08.529
that you did exist,

01:11:08.531 --> 01:11:12.900
what my requests
would be this Christmas.

01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:15.503
It won't take long,
I promise.

01:11:15.505 --> 01:11:19.407
So, firstly,

01:11:19.409 --> 01:11:21.042
I'd like things
to be better

01:11:21.044 --> 01:11:24.879
for the homeless,
the old, the sick,

01:11:24.881 --> 01:11:28.349
and anyone
who's not doing so great.

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:34.789
I'm sorry
for when I judge people.

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:37.959
And I'm sorry
for the not-so-good things

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:39.394
I've done lately.

01:11:39.396 --> 01:11:44.332
It just seems kind of hard
to avoid doing them.

01:11:44.334 --> 01:11:49.003
But I'll try and do better,
I promise.

01:11:49.005 --> 01:11:51.105
Oh, and this might
sound really petty,

01:11:51.107 --> 01:11:53.274
but could you please
help everyone learn

01:11:53.276 --> 01:11:57.545
how to pronounce
"In Excelsis Deo" correctly?

01:11:57.547 --> 01:11:59.147
Thanks.

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:03.851
And...

01:12:06.588 --> 01:12:08.156
I know...

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:15.563
that my mom probably
isn't up there with you,

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:20.668
but if she was,
I just want her to know

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:25.873
that I really,
really, really miss her.

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:30.378
And I know
that my dad does too.

01:12:32.715 --> 01:12:37.085
As for him,
I'm just tired of fighting.

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:42.523
I just
really wish everything

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:44.158
could be like
it was before.

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:49.731
So, anyway,
that's it I guess.

01:12:49.733 --> 01:12:51.332
Amen.

01:12:51.334 --> 01:12:53.935
Oh, and happy birthday.

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.987
( doorbell buzzes )

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:21.362
I know it's Christmas,

01:13:21.364 --> 01:13:23.131
so you don't have to work,
even though you're Jewish,

01:13:23.133 --> 01:13:24.632
and technically
you don't celebrate,

01:13:24.634 --> 01:13:25.767
but we need to talk.

01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:27.268
Are you okay?

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:28.536
Not really, no.

01:13:28.538 --> 01:13:30.538
And I'm sorry to interrupt
your non-holiday,

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.407
but I couldn't wait
another week to tell you

01:13:32.409 --> 01:13:33.975
that your list is crap.

01:13:33.977 --> 01:13:36.244
- All right, just hold on--
- No. I will not hold on.

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:37.712
I need you
to listen to me.

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:40.314
Because of you,
I am a fish murderer.

01:13:40.316 --> 01:13:42.617
Even worse, I almost slept
with an engaged guy.

01:13:42.619 --> 01:13:44.719
And I am
more confused than ever.

01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:46.120
Like, is it
so wrong for me

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:48.356
to do what is right
and be happy?

01:13:48.358 --> 01:13:50.024
Because if so,
I am destined to be

01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:51.359
a miserable person,
list or no list.

01:13:51.361 --> 01:13:52.827
Carrie, stop.
Please, come inside--

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:54.295
I know what
you're going to say.

01:13:54.297 --> 01:13:55.830
You're gonna say
I can't say the list is crap

01:13:55.832 --> 01:13:57.165
because
I haven't finished it yet.

01:13:57.167 --> 01:13:58.466
But the thing is,
I can't finish it

01:13:58.468 --> 01:13:59.901
because I left
my "Franny and Zooey"

01:13:59.903 --> 01:14:01.335
at Professor Harrison's.

01:14:01.337 --> 01:14:04.238
- Okay, so get it back.
- I told you, I can't!

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.407
I don't need to finish
the list to know that,

01:14:06.409 --> 01:14:09.844
shocker--
drinking a cherry soda

01:14:09.846 --> 01:14:12.547
will not make my dad
pay attention to me.

01:14:12.549 --> 01:14:15.550
Having a goldfish
won't bring my mom back.

01:14:15.552 --> 01:14:18.085
It did help me learn,
though, that going on a date

01:14:18.087 --> 01:14:20.354
could make me feel
more lonely than ever.

01:14:20.356 --> 01:14:22.323
You know what I think?
I think you're the one
who needs a list.

01:14:22.325 --> 01:14:23.925
And it should have things
on it like,

01:14:23.927 --> 01:14:25.460
"Don't have affairs
with married women."

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:27.094
- Now wait a minute.
- And fine, you're an adult,

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:29.197
so you can do what you like,
but so can I.

01:14:29.199 --> 01:14:30.731
And just because
I don't want to do

01:14:30.733 --> 01:14:33.134
demeaning or immoral things
doesn't make me a prude.

01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:34.335
I mean, a prude
wouldn't sleep with

01:14:34.337 --> 01:14:35.937
her English professor,
would she?

01:14:35.939 --> 01:14:37.438
You slept with
your English professor?

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:40.308
Dad!

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:41.609
Petrov:
I tried to tell you.

01:14:41.611 --> 01:14:42.743
What are you doing here?

01:14:42.745 --> 01:14:43.945
What--
what is he doing here?

01:14:43.947 --> 01:14:45.413
I was worried about you.

01:14:45.415 --> 01:14:47.348
Obviously,
I had a very good reason to.

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:49.150
- Why didn't you call?
- I did call.

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:50.318
You didn't pick up
your phone.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.854
Because my phones
are broken!

01:14:52.856 --> 01:14:53.921
Where's your new family?

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:55.256
Did you ship them off too,

01:14:55.258 --> 01:14:56.624
so you didn't have to deal
with them?

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:58.025
That's not fair, Carrie.

01:14:58.027 --> 01:15:00.127
What he did to me
isn't fair.

01:15:00.129 --> 01:15:01.629
That didn't stop him.

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:03.130
Go home, Dad.

01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:05.032
I came so that
you wouldn't have to go

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:06.501
to London,

01:15:06.503 --> 01:15:07.835
which you seem to hate.

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:09.971
No, I don't hate London,
I hate you!

01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:12.540
And I hate
this stupid list!

01:15:12.542 --> 01:15:14.242
( sighs )

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:17.912
Well...

01:15:17.914 --> 01:15:18.913
that went well.

01:15:18.915 --> 01:15:21.249
Give her some time.

01:16:14.436 --> 01:16:15.570
Hi.

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:19.173
Wasn't sure
if you'd remember.

01:16:21.109 --> 01:16:23.978
It's been such long time.

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.681
I'm a prodigy, aren't I?

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:29.016
I think I can remember
the simple phrase,

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:30.518
"If you get lost,

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.720
I'll meet you
at Hans Christian Andersen."

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:40.828
Poor guy.

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:43.931
Never found love.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:45.733
Wrote all those books
for children

01:16:45.735 --> 01:16:47.735
and never had
any of his own.

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:49.303
Mm.

01:16:49.305 --> 01:16:51.038
Might be a good thing.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.506
If he had them,
he undoubtedly

01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:54.875
would have
disappointed them.

01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:04.318
I really want you
to like Felicity.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.021
I should have
told you.

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:09.323
But I thought that
if you met her first,

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:13.327
then she and and her kids,
you'd give them

01:17:13.329 --> 01:17:15.463
a bit more of a chance.

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:20.935
When your mother
got sick,

01:17:20.937 --> 01:17:26.440
I felt that I had
failed her somehow.

01:17:27.909 --> 01:17:30.911
My whole reason for being

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:35.883
was to take care of her,
and you.

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:38.552
And then I got
really terrified

01:17:38.554 --> 01:17:44.191
that I was going to fail you
as well.

01:17:44.193 --> 01:17:46.661
So, I thought
that you would be better off

01:17:46.663 --> 01:17:50.598
with people who understood
how to teach you.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.968
I mean, you were so far ahead
of your classmates.

01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:55.469
You were brilliant.

01:17:55.471 --> 01:17:57.605
And I thought if you went
to college,

01:17:57.607 --> 01:18:02.176
you'd meet people
who were of like mind.

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:04.545
I was 14.

01:18:04.547 --> 01:18:05.913
I was a freak.

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:12.286
What about
the English teacher?

01:18:12.288 --> 01:18:14.922
Made me feel like
less of one.

01:18:14.924 --> 01:18:17.992
At the beginning
at least.

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:26.901
Did he... hurt you?

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:29.804
No, no,
it wasn't like that.

01:18:31.273 --> 01:18:32.773
You can press charges.

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:35.009
Dad, I don't think
you can press charges

01:18:35.011 --> 01:18:36.343
for hurting
someone's feelings.

01:18:36.345 --> 01:18:37.845
That's not what
I'm talking about.

01:18:37.847 --> 01:18:39.780
I'm talking about the fact
that you were underage.

01:18:39.782 --> 01:18:41.082
I was 16.

01:18:41.084 --> 01:18:43.284
That's the legal age
of consent.

01:18:43.286 --> 01:18:46.987
And anyway,
he never forced me.

01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:48.389
He manipulated you.

01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:51.592
He used his position.

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:55.096
I'm gonna have him fired.

01:18:55.098 --> 01:18:57.398
Well, he's teaching
at Columbia now,

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.533
so it looks like
someone beat you to it.

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:06.340
I just wish the bastard
would give me my book back.

01:19:06.342 --> 01:19:10.144
- What book?
- "Franny and Zooey."

01:19:10.146 --> 01:19:12.079
Don't you remember?

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:13.781
Mom gave me
a first edition

01:19:13.783 --> 01:19:16.717
for my 12th birthday.

01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:19.320
Oh, yes.

01:19:19.322 --> 01:19:22.289
So she did.

01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:23.958
You lent him that book?

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.961
I thought
he'd appreciate it.

01:19:26.963 --> 01:19:28.896
I thought
he'd appreciate me.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.968
Right, that's it.

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:35.536
Come on, let's go.

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:38.072
Where?

01:19:38.074 --> 01:19:39.540
We're gonna get
your book back.

01:19:39.542 --> 01:19:41.642
- What?
- Where's he live?

01:19:41.644 --> 01:19:42.910
Dad,
I really don't think--

01:19:42.912 --> 01:19:45.079
Carrie,
where does he live?

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:55.856
Hi.

01:19:55.858 --> 01:19:56.924
Hi.

01:19:56.926 --> 01:19:58.225
Is David here?

01:19:58.227 --> 01:19:59.460
Professor Harrison:
Who is it, Amanda?

01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:02.363
There's a girl
here to see you.

01:20:05.233 --> 01:20:06.367
Carrie.

01:20:06.369 --> 01:20:09.470
What
an unexpected pleasure.

01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:13.007
This is Amanda,
my wife.

01:20:13.009 --> 01:20:14.909
<i>Carrie Pilby, a student.</i>

01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:16.877
Ex-student.

01:20:16.879 --> 01:20:18.612
You got married?

01:20:18.614 --> 01:20:19.880
Yeah.

01:20:19.882 --> 01:20:21.215
Congratulations.

01:20:21.217 --> 01:20:24.451
I'm Daniel Pilby,
Carrie's father.

01:20:24.453 --> 01:20:26.787
Well, it's nice
to meet you.

01:20:26.789 --> 01:20:28.489
We've come to get a book

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:29.857
that your husband's been
kind enough

01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:31.358
to look after for me.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.360
Oh, yeah, the book.

01:20:33.362 --> 01:20:35.696
Well, it's somewhere
inside the house.

01:20:35.698 --> 01:20:37.231
As soon as I have a chance,
I'll find it,

01:20:37.233 --> 01:20:38.532
and I'll put it
in the mail.

01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:40.100
Why don't we save you
the trouble

01:20:40.102 --> 01:20:42.736
and have
a quick look ourselves?

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:46.006
Excuse me.

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:48.342
I already told you,
I don't know where it is.

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:50.845
But you said yourself
it must be here somewhere.

01:20:50.847 --> 01:20:52.680
Hello.

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:56.951
Do you mind?

01:20:56.953 --> 01:20:58.152
No, not at all.

01:20:58.154 --> 01:21:00.454
We won't be a moment.

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:03.257

01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:04.725

I think
you're gonna be okay.

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:15.529
I missed you.

01:22:15.531 --> 01:22:17.932
And I missed you too.

01:22:17.934 --> 01:22:20.601

I'm 19.

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:33.113
I'm not supposed
to be sorted yet.

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:34.448
Okay.

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:44.191
I come in peace.

01:22:44.193 --> 01:22:46.727
Carrie, hi.

01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:49.596
I wasn't sure
if you'd show up

01:22:49.598 --> 01:22:51.398
for your appointment
today.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.200
Did your dad leave?

01:22:53.202 --> 01:22:54.635
Yeah, he did.

01:22:54.637 --> 01:22:57.771
I miss him already.

01:22:57.773 --> 01:22:59.540
You can go back to sleep
if you want.

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:02.476
No, no.
I was just a little tired.

01:23:03.945 --> 01:23:05.813
Long night?

01:23:05.815 --> 01:23:08.649
You do realize
it's not appropriate for me

01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:12.419
to discuss
my personal life with you.

01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:14.521
I think
it would really help me

01:23:14.523 --> 01:23:15.923
if you did.

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:24.231
All right.

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:26.533
What do you
want to know?

01:23:26.535 --> 01:23:28.235
Was there ever a time

01:23:28.237 --> 01:23:30.170
when you thought
that cheating was wrong?

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:32.973
Of course.
I still do.

01:23:32.975 --> 01:23:35.309
Then how do
you justify it?
Don't you feel bad?

01:23:35.311 --> 01:23:37.277
Yes.

01:23:37.279 --> 01:23:39.246
No.

01:23:39.248 --> 01:23:40.781
All of the above.

01:23:40.783 --> 01:23:44.685
I do part-time consulting
for Cheryl's agency.

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:47.621
She works
with abused children.

01:23:47.623 --> 01:23:51.225
We spent
a lot of time together.

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:54.161
I invited her
for coffee.

01:23:54.163 --> 01:23:57.865
We talked,
we talked more.

01:23:57.867 --> 01:24:00.267
We wanted to spend
more time together.

01:24:00.269 --> 01:24:01.602
I suppose I am

01:24:01.604 --> 01:24:03.604
what you might call
a hypocrite.

01:24:03.606 --> 01:24:06.073
<i>It must bring you great joy</i>
<i>to hear me say that.</i>

01:24:06.075 --> 01:24:07.908
No, no.
It doesn't.

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:11.512
Her husband doesn't show her
any affection.

01:24:11.514 --> 01:24:14.448
- That's an excuse.
- He's always gone.

01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:16.150
- Excuse.
- He's been cheating.

01:24:16.152 --> 01:24:17.151
- Excuse.
- And maybe--

01:24:17.153 --> 01:24:19.053
Excuse!

01:24:19.055 --> 01:24:20.521
( sighs )

01:24:20.523 --> 01:24:22.723
Maybe she'll leave him?

01:24:25.126 --> 01:24:26.827
Excuse.

01:24:29.864 --> 01:24:31.632
I just came
to let you know

01:24:31.634 --> 01:24:33.133
that my dad and I
made up.

01:24:33.135 --> 01:24:35.569
I'm very glad.

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:37.571
And, okay.

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:41.642
He helped me
to get this back.

01:24:46.147 --> 01:24:49.049
"Franny and Zooey."

01:24:49.051 --> 01:24:51.351
And as we often say
in my profession,

01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:53.520
how did that
make you feel?

01:24:53.522 --> 01:24:57.091
Like maybe I should finish
that silly,

01:24:57.093 --> 01:24:59.560
or not so silly,

01:24:59.562 --> 01:25:02.830
list that I threw
in your general direction?

01:25:02.832 --> 01:25:05.365
Oh, I was hoping
you'd say that.

01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:07.501
You saved it.

01:25:07.503 --> 01:25:08.836
Just in case.

01:25:08.838 --> 01:25:11.038
I have a photographic memory,
remember?

01:25:13.374 --> 01:25:14.875
Thank you.

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:19.246
So, what are you going
to do about Mrs. Rubin?

01:25:19.248 --> 01:25:21.949
I don't know.

01:25:21.951 --> 01:25:24.885
Contrary to what the degrees
on the wall may imply,

01:25:24.887 --> 01:25:27.254
I don't have
all the answers.

01:25:27.256 --> 01:25:30.757
I wouldn't trust anyone
who thought that they did.

01:25:30.759 --> 01:25:32.726
Maybe you need
to make her a list.

to leave her husband."

01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:37.231
( both laugh )

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.768
You know, sometimes...

01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:45.205
you really remind me
of your mother.

01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:48.242
Thanks.

01:25:48.244 --> 01:25:50.244
I'll take that
as a compliment.

01:25:50.246 --> 01:25:53.013
<i>Compliment intended.</i>

01:25:54.048 --> 01:25:56.250
You are allowed
to be happy, Carrie.

01:25:56.252 --> 01:26:00.020
<i>You know that,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

01:26:00.022 --> 01:26:02.389
Your mom
would want that for you.

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:37.991
( shutter clicks )

01:26:54.509 --> 01:26:55.876
Shit.

01:26:58.546 --> 01:27:00.047
Carrie!

01:27:00.049 --> 01:27:01.548
Oh, thank God!

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:03.483
I thought you might
never speak to me again

01:27:03.485 --> 01:27:05.152
after I abandoned you
at Dex's gig.

01:27:05.154 --> 01:27:06.720
How can I ever
make it up to you?

01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:08.088
You already did.

01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:09.856
You helped me
cross something off my list.

01:27:09.858 --> 01:27:11.558
I did?
Which one?

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.726
Make a friend.

01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:14.995
- Oh!
- Oh, okay.

01:27:14.997 --> 01:27:17.364
You're hurting me
a little bit.

01:27:17.366 --> 01:27:18.599
Oh, come on.

01:27:18.601 --> 01:27:19.800
I want to introduce you
to Dex.

01:27:19.802 --> 01:27:21.335
- Dex? Dex-Dex?
- Yeah.

01:27:21.337 --> 01:27:23.670
What, "Nationally
registered tongue" Dex?

01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:26.406
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, sorry!

01:27:26.408 --> 01:27:28.675
( muttering )

01:27:28.677 --> 01:27:30.677
Oh, Carrie, this is Dex.

01:27:30.679 --> 01:27:31.812
Dex, this is Carrie.

01:27:31.814 --> 01:27:33.280
Hi, nice to meet you!

01:27:33.282 --> 01:27:34.381
Yeah, you too.

01:27:34.383 --> 01:27:37.417
Oh, uh--

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:39.686
He seems... nice.

01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:41.221
Yeah, he is.

01:27:41.223 --> 01:27:43.590
I'll call you.
We'll go for lunch.

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:45.492
Oh, oh!
I would love that.

01:27:45.494 --> 01:27:47.227
Well, see you later!

01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:49.062
Okay.

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:55.235
Pilby!

01:27:58.573 --> 01:28:00.907
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:28:00.909 --> 01:28:04.278
Are you wearing
eye makeup?

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.879
It looks good.

01:28:05.881 --> 01:28:10.217
Hey, what's the square root
of 6,023?

01:28:10.219 --> 01:28:11.752
Seventy-five.

01:28:11.754 --> 01:28:13.620
You're a freaking genius!

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:16.523
- I made it up.
- Like, what's the equation?

01:28:16.525 --> 01:28:17.824
What special equations
do you use?

01:28:17.826 --> 01:28:19.626
You know what,
I'll tell you on Monday.

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:21.061
You're leaving?

01:28:21.063 --> 01:28:25.799
I have a party limit,
and I'm all partied out.

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:27.668
But I'll see you later.
Happy New Year.

<i>Come on, get in the hot tub.</i>
<i>- Fuck it.</i>

01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:08.308
Hey.

01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:11.311
Hi.
You must be Ted.

01:29:13.081 --> 01:29:15.282
Is Cy in?

01:29:15.284 --> 01:29:16.416
Moved out.

01:29:16.418 --> 01:29:18.151
What?

01:29:18.153 --> 01:29:19.152
When?

01:29:19.154 --> 01:29:20.120
Yesterday.

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:23.557
Oh, okay.

01:29:23.559 --> 01:29:24.958
Um...

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.159
- Well--
- Bye-bye, then.

01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:27.294
Oh, okay, um--

01:29:27.296 --> 01:29:28.829
Well, is there any way
that I could--

01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:30.163
Happy New Year.

01:29:30.165 --> 01:29:32.299
Is it--

01:29:32.301 --> 01:29:34.468
<i>( footsteps approach )</i>

01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:35.769
What is the matter
with you?

01:29:35.771 --> 01:29:38.739
<i>Can you not stop lying</i>
<i>for one minute?</i>

01:29:38.741 --> 01:29:40.273
Hey, sorry.

01:29:40.275 --> 01:29:42.042
You see what I mean?
The guy's a compulsive liar.

01:29:42.044 --> 01:29:43.810
You literally can't believe
a word he says.

01:29:43.812 --> 01:29:45.145
Nice tux.

01:29:45.147 --> 01:29:47.481
Oh, yeah.
We had a concert.

01:29:47.483 --> 01:29:49.015
I just got back.

01:29:49.017 --> 01:29:51.985
You didn't wanna go out
after?

01:29:51.987 --> 01:29:53.887
New Year's Eve
isn't really my thing.

01:29:53.889 --> 01:29:56.890
Me neither.

01:29:56.892 --> 01:29:59.793
Do you want
to come in?

01:29:59.795 --> 01:30:01.628
If that's okay.

01:30:01.630 --> 01:30:05.098
Yeah, I think
that could be okay.

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:08.335
Actually, would you mind
waiting here one second?

01:30:08.337 --> 01:30:09.669
There's just
something I have to do

01:30:09.671 --> 01:30:11.004
really, really quickly.

01:30:11.006 --> 01:30:12.706
I'll be--
I'll be one minute.

01:30:12.708 --> 01:30:13.974
Okay.

01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:25.919
<i>( knocking on window )</i>

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:39.766
You're always
disappearing.

01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:43.670
Sorry, I thought
I left the stove on.

01:30:43.672 --> 01:30:44.905
That's okay.

01:30:44.907 --> 01:30:46.740
This is a much
better spot anyway.

01:30:46.742 --> 01:30:47.874
Spot?

01:30:47.876 --> 01:30:49.910
To watch the fireworks.

01:30:49.912 --> 01:30:51.344
They're about to start.

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:55.215
Here, take my hand.

01:31:02.657 --> 01:31:04.825
It's freezing.

01:31:04.827 --> 01:31:06.026
I'd loan you my coat,

01:31:06.028 --> 01:31:07.294
but someone forgot
to return it.

01:31:07.296 --> 01:31:08.528
Oh, right.

01:31:08.530 --> 01:31:10.864
Oh, I'm sorry.
Shall I pop in and grab it?

01:31:10.866 --> 01:31:13.533
You just stay right here,
Carrie Pilby.

01:31:17.805 --> 01:31:20.807
So, what's Cy short for?

01:31:20.809 --> 01:31:22.309
Cyrus.

01:31:24.011 --> 01:31:25.745
What about Carrie?

01:31:25.747 --> 01:31:27.380
Nothing.

01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:31.251
It's just Carrie.

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:36.523
