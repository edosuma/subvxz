03:07.759 --> 03:11.722
All right, let's go, people!
One minute before tardy lockdown!

03:12.097 --> 03:14.933
Let's go! Everybody move inside!

03:15.100 --> 03:16.100
Good morning.

03:16.351 --> 03:17.936
Let's go! Let her go!

03:18.145 --> 03:20.313
No smoking!
I don't smoke, you don't smoke!

03:20.522 --> 03:23.191
Let's go, people!
Today's a good day to learn.

03:35.704 --> 03:37.122
Watch yourselves!

03:37.289 --> 03:39.916
No riding bikes in the hallways, stupid!

03:42.544 --> 03:43.879
Coming through!

03:54.598 --> 03:56.683
You late, Garfield. You late!

03:57.058 --> 03:59.895
Au contraire, my homeboy.
The bell hasn't rung yet.

04:00.103 --> 04:02.898
- You is a crazy nigga, G.
- Very true, man.

04:03.106 --> 04:05.609
Thank you very much for sharing that.
Let's go.

04:05.817 --> 04:08.945
You two, please.
This is not the Playboy Channel.

04:09.905 --> 04:13.074
Good morning, one and all.
Let's get started, please.

04:13.408 --> 04:15.744
August, Tywan,
would you pass out the book?

04:15.952 --> 04:17.495
What up with your car?

04:17.704 --> 04:19.915
Your Pinto with the 8-track blew up?

04:20.832 --> 04:23.043
Attention, please!

04:25.003 --> 04:29.174
I'm sure some of you are wondering
why I brought this bicycle to class.

04:31.593 --> 04:32.761
Excuse me. Grasshopper?

04:34.513 --> 04:35.513
Thank you.

04:36.264 --> 04:37.390
The purpose of the bike...

04:37.599 --> 04:39.643
is to demonstrate centripetal force...

04:39.851 --> 04:42.604
the opposite of the force
we studied yesterday...

04:42.812 --> 04:44.731
which was...?

04:46.316 --> 04:48.818
Centrifugal force.

04:50.487 --> 04:52.030
I thought I'd demonstrate.

04:53.156 --> 04:54.156
Tywan?

04:54.241 --> 04:56.535
Would you come up here
and help me, please?

04:58.119 --> 04:59.371
Yo, what up?

04:59.579 --> 05:01.248
Go see what your daddy want.

05:01.706 --> 05:03.041
Here you go.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.627
Brace these handlebars behind your knees.

05:06.795 --> 05:07.796
Sit.

05:11.967 --> 05:14.511
Crank the pedals. Get that wheel going...

05:14.719 --> 05:16.054
about 180 rpm.

05:16.263 --> 05:18.848
- What's up with this?
- Come on!

05:19.057 --> 05:21.268
Put some muscle into it. Come on!

05:21.476 --> 05:24.437
It's crazy, man. Got a nigger
riding a bike going nowhere.

05:24.646 --> 05:26.523
Bear with me. You'll see.

05:26.731 --> 05:27.731
Harder!

05:28.400 --> 05:29.609
Harder!

05:30.735 --> 05:31.987
Come on, T, get playing!

05:32.195 --> 05:33.571
Tilt the wheel to your right.

05:33.863 --> 05:35.115
Right?

05:37.701 --> 05:40.662
Augie, check me out! Know what I'm saying?

05:42.289 --> 05:44.207
Tywan! Tywan!

05:47.794 --> 05:51.214
Spinning like a motherfucker!
You know what I mean?

06:05.645 --> 06:07.856
Spin like a nut!

06:08.773 --> 06:10.316
What's my name?

06:27.125 --> 06:29.127
Walter, I need to talk.

06:30.336 --> 06:32.422
I'm pretty busy now. What is it?

06:33.048 --> 06:34.758
Open it.

06:37.302 --> 06:40.430
I don't suppose this kid
cares about our budget crisis.

06:40.638 --> 06:42.640
Have the textbook room charge him for it.

06:42.849 --> 06:46.144
That says 187.
That's the police code for homicide.

06:46.352 --> 06:48.438
I know what it stands for.

06:48.646 --> 06:51.524
The kid probably heard it in a rap song.
Means nothing.

06:51.733 --> 06:54.986
The book belongs to Dennis Broadway.
He's a known gangster.

06:55.653 --> 07:00.575
Garfield, if I had a dollar for every
time a student threatened faculty...

07:01.201 --> 07:04.120
Did you tell Dennis he was
getting a fail from me?

07:05.288 --> 07:07.165
I have legal access to those files.

07:10.627 --> 07:13.755
He's a transfer from Nixon, isn't he?

07:14.172 --> 07:17.425
If he gets through this semester,
he gets to go back to Nixon.

07:17.634 --> 07:21.304
He blew his opportunity. Now
he has to live with the consequences.

07:21.513 --> 07:25.391
I don't think he wants to live with
the consequences. He wants me dead.

07:25.642 --> 07:28.269
Relax. This has nothing to do with you.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.688
I should've been told, Walter.

07:32.065 --> 07:33.775
You know what your problem is?

07:33.983 --> 07:36.820
On the one hand, you think
someone's trying to kill you.

07:37.153 --> 07:42.075
On the other hand, you believe kids
are paying attention in your classes.

09:16.669 --> 09:18.713
Call 911!

09:49.827 --> 09:50.661
Morning.

09:50.828 --> 09:54.707
Mr. Garfield, this is the Sub Unit.
Are you available for work?

09:54.916 --> 09:55.916
Sure.

09:55.958 --> 09:58.711
There's a science class
at John Quincy Adams.

09:58.920 --> 10:02.799
It's a four-day assignment.
The teacher's name is Eskander.

10:03.049 --> 10:04.675
All right. Thank you.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.611
If you’re listening, God...

10:23.820 --> 10:25.488
please help me today.

10:26.656 --> 10:29.617
Please give me a chance to do my job...

10:29.826 --> 10:33.037
which you put me here
to do in the first place.

10:33.454 --> 10:38.376
God, grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change...

10:38.709 --> 10:41.838
the courage to change the things I can...

10:42.213 --> 10:44.841
and the wisdom to know the difference.

10:45.716 --> 10:48.094
It's me, Trevor, God.

10:50.930 --> 10:52.306
Amen.

11:46.944 --> 11:48.571
Baseball cap, give it up.

11:49.864 --> 11:50.865
Hold, please.

11:51.115 --> 11:53.159
- I'm a substitute.
- Card?

11:54.410 --> 11:58.331
You want the main office down the hall.
Check in with Mrs. Ford.

12:01.959 --> 12:03.002
Excuse me?

12:03.461 --> 12:05.338
Could you tell me where Bungalow 86 is?

12:05.671 --> 12:09.008
Next to the parking lot.
Last bungalow on the left.

12:09.675 --> 12:10.675
Good luck.

14:02.204 --> 14:04.164
I can't even read that shit!

14:08.335 --> 14:09.628
Look at that!

14:20.598 --> 14:21.598
Morning.

14:23.309 --> 14:26.312
Before I take the roll,
I'd like to make a point.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.939
"Farfie"? What up, Farfie?

14:31.191 --> 14:34.695
It's not important
who or what "Farfie" is.

14:35.029 --> 14:36.614
The point I'd like to make is...

14:36.822 --> 14:38.782
anyone here can be a scientist.

14:38.991 --> 14:40.618
What's he talking about?

14:40.909 --> 14:44.038
A scientist is like a detective.

14:45.289 --> 14:47.916
He investigates data
he doesn't understand...

14:49.418 --> 14:51.086
by scratching the surface...

14:51.295 --> 14:53.213
so he can see what's underneath.

14:59.428 --> 15:01.388
Things like this.

15:02.806 --> 15:03.891
No, watch!

15:06.935 --> 15:08.062
What...

15:09.063 --> 15:10.063
did...

15:10.147 --> 15:11.940
Glis pimp?

15:14.610 --> 15:16.570
Where does your teacher keep the chalk?

15:16.820 --> 15:17.863
In the desk.

15:24.953 --> 15:26.205
Can I help you?

15:31.085 --> 15:34.213
Sorry I'm late. I had to
handle something. You a sub?

15:35.005 --> 15:36.715
For Ms. Eskander. Science.

15:36.924 --> 15:38.300
Eskander?

15:38.550 --> 15:41.261
Well, this is Dave Childress.
American History.

15:47.142 --> 15:50.979
I don't know how to break it to you,
Mr... Garfield?

15:52.648 --> 15:55.984
This is Bungalow 84. You want Bungalow 86.

15:56.735 --> 15:58.195
It's not your fault.

15:58.612 --> 16:00.697
You must've zagged
when you should've zigged.

16:00.906 --> 16:03.826
Somebody stole the number.
I keep asking Garcia to fix it...

16:04.034 --> 16:05.702
but all I get is nada.

16:05.911 --> 16:07.663
Eskander? Come here.

16:08.539 --> 16:10.332
See this mess over here?

16:13.210 --> 16:14.920
That's Eskander.

16:42.739 --> 16:44.324
It's not real.

16:45.075 --> 16:47.452
We're studying teen-parenting in Home Ec.

16:47.661 --> 16:50.664
It's computerized, so it cries and shit.

17:13.979 --> 17:15.689
How'd those books get outside?

17:16.815 --> 17:18.317
No speak inglés.

17:19.358 --> 17:21.444
Speak Spanish, Mr...?

17:21.819 --> 17:22.819
Garfield.

17:22.988 --> 17:24.823
My name's Garfield.

17:25.115 --> 17:26.992
Speak Spanish, Mr. G?

17:29.786 --> 17:32.623
You know what that means
when a homeboy calls you "G"?

17:33.457 --> 17:35.542
It means "gangster," ese.

17:35.792 --> 17:37.544
You a gangster, maestro?

17:38.086 --> 17:39.086
No.

17:39.129 --> 17:40.839
I'm not a gangster.

17:42.049 --> 17:45.802
Would you do me a favor and please
go out there and pick up those books?

17:46.637 --> 17:48.388
I ain't picking that shit up!

17:48.597 --> 17:49.723
You pick it up.

17:51.141 --> 17:52.392
What's your name?

17:56.021 --> 17:57.981
What is your name?

17:58.982 --> 18:00.275
Cesar Chavez.

18:01.109 --> 18:02.235
Don't you recognize me?

18:04.696 --> 18:06.073
Do you see this?

18:06.740 --> 18:08.492
See, I'm already on house arrest.

18:08.700 --> 18:11.828
- There's nothing you can do to me.
- Straight up, dog!

18:12.829 --> 18:14.414
I'm out of here.

18:15.749 --> 18:16.917
Could you have a seat?

18:18.377 --> 18:19.378
Guys?

18:19.586 --> 18:23.882
Mr. G, those guys that just walked out
aren't even in here this period.

18:24.299 --> 18:26.176
And this fool's name is Benny Chacon.

18:26.385 --> 18:28.178
Shut your mouth, hood rat.

18:28.387 --> 18:30.305
- Schoolgirl bitch.
- That's enough!

18:30.514 --> 18:33.934
You ain't no real teacher, fool.
You're nothing but a sub.

18:35.519 --> 18:37.479
Why do you wear that rosary?

18:38.980 --> 18:40.190
To put God on me, okay?

18:40.399 --> 18:44.027
So why don't you go read your newspaper,
wannabe motherfucker.

18:46.113 --> 18:47.989
Are you done?

18:52.494 --> 18:54.121
Give me a referral and shut up.

19:04.464 --> 19:05.882
For future reference...

19:06.091 --> 19:07.968
anyone who disrupts a class...

19:08.176 --> 19:10.345
is subject to disciplinary action.

19:12.472 --> 19:15.517
This classroom is our sanctuary.

19:15.725 --> 19:18.061
Yours and mine.

19:18.770 --> 19:20.397
Respect it.

19:21.815 --> 19:24.067
And for your information...

19:24.776 --> 19:27.654
I am a real teacher.

19:31.992 --> 19:33.702
Whatever you say, Opie.

19:44.421 --> 19:46.923
Who'd like to help me pick up those books?

20:27.923 --> 20:30.216
What the hell's happening, little sister?

20:39.142 --> 20:40.727
How goes the battle?

20:42.437 --> 20:44.022
Did you...

20:45.148 --> 20:48.318
get your "binky marsden farfied"?

20:50.278 --> 20:51.863
You want some advice?

20:52.489 --> 20:56.159
First one of these homeboys who
gives you the slightest bit of shit...

20:56.618 --> 21:00.038
you march his ass down to Larry Hyland.
He's their counselor.

21:00.830 --> 21:03.500
Because you gotta sacrifice one of them.

21:03.708 --> 21:06.252
Show them some balls.
Let them know who's boss.

21:06.670 --> 21:09.172
And don't look to
the administration for support.

21:09.631 --> 21:13.218
They haven't been in a classroom.
They don't know shit.

21:13.551 --> 21:14.761
Look at me.

21:15.971 --> 21:18.890
I got tenure and I'm still
in the damn bungalows.

21:19.099 --> 21:22.852
I should be in the "A" building
in one of the air-conditioned rooms.

21:23.436 --> 21:24.646
You met Garcia yet?

21:25.105 --> 21:26.731
Our principal?

21:27.649 --> 21:28.775
Hey, Dave.

21:32.195 --> 21:34.239
Ellen Henry. Computer science.

21:34.698 --> 21:36.282
Trevor Garfield.

21:37.033 --> 21:38.993
Nice scar you got there.

21:40.912 --> 21:42.247
You ever sub here before?

21:42.497 --> 21:43.707
No. First time.

21:44.165 --> 21:45.375
What about permanent?

21:45.667 --> 21:49.212
Seven years in the Bed-Sty
section of Brooklyn.

21:49.421 --> 21:50.755
Roosevelt Whitney High.

21:51.673 --> 21:53.216
Roosevelt Whitney?

21:54.384 --> 21:57.637
Isn't it where that teacher
got stabbed to death last year?

21:58.346 --> 21:59.556
Actually, he survived.

21:59.764 --> 22:02.767
No, no. It was on 60 Minutes.
There was this teacher...

22:02.976 --> 22:07.147
that gangbanger stabbed
about a dozen times in the hallway.

22:11.484 --> 22:12.861
Jesus Christ!

22:14.779 --> 22:15.779
You're him!

22:16.364 --> 22:17.615
It was you!

22:19.033 --> 22:22.328
Holy shit, Garfield!
When was that, last fall? When?

22:23.580 --> 22:25.248
October 27.

22:27.792 --> 22:29.377
What a schmuck!

22:29.627 --> 22:32.839
I'm giving advice to a guy
with a Purple Heart!

22:33.047 --> 22:34.507
Excuse me.

22:34.716 --> 22:35.508
Listen to me.

22:35.717 --> 22:39.679
In my book, you're a hero, man.
Damn straight!

22:40.889 --> 22:44.309
- Getting stabbed doesn't make me a hero.
- What'd they do to the kid?

22:46.102 --> 22:50.023
Put him in a facility upstate
till he's 21.

22:50.231 --> 22:52.192
That's it? They should've caned him.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.987
They should've caned the bastard
like they did that kid in Singapore.

22:56.196 --> 22:59.282
President of Singapore
had a few choice words.

23:00.575 --> 23:03.870
"When a continuing state
of defiance and disorder...

23:04.579 --> 23:07.290
cannot be checked by the rules...

23:07.749 --> 23:10.668
then new and sometimes drastic rules...

23:10.877 --> 23:13.546
must be forged to maintain order.

23:14.047 --> 23:16.549
The alternative is anarchy."

23:17.592 --> 23:19.052
Why do you still teach?

23:20.428 --> 23:24.224
The same reason that you do, Garfield.
For the paycheck.

24:02.303 --> 24:04.305
Hold on, everyone.

24:04.639 --> 24:06.474
I still have a few minutes.

24:10.228 --> 24:14.524
Tell me the difference between the
central nervous system and the lymphatic.

24:16.067 --> 24:17.986
You got a nice butt.

24:21.990 --> 24:25.284
Since you seem to know
so much about anatomy, Ms...

24:25.868 --> 24:27.745
Nartinez...

24:27.954 --> 24:30.289
Central nervous system and the lymphatic.

24:30.665 --> 24:32.125
Tell me the difference.

24:33.626 --> 24:35.420
It's like the...

24:35.628 --> 24:38.339
The central nervous system is...

24:38.548 --> 24:42.051
your brain and your spinal cord.

24:42.260 --> 24:46.806
And the lymphatic system is the stuff
in your blood that fights diseases.

24:47.181 --> 24:47.974
That's right!

24:48.182 --> 24:49.475
Schoolgirl!

24:49.684 --> 24:51.477
That bitch was cheating.

24:53.187 --> 24:55.189
Are you writing on your desk, Mr...

24:55.898 --> 24:56.898
Sanchez?

24:56.941 --> 24:59.110
I don't see nothing in my hands, do you?

25:07.326 --> 25:09.328
"K.O.S."

25:09.537 --> 25:11.080
What's that? A tagging crew?

25:13.249 --> 25:15.626
- "Cartoon." That you?
- It might be.

25:16.544 --> 25:18.880
Does K.O.S. have something
to do with Benny?

25:19.088 --> 25:20.339
Don't go there.

25:20.590 --> 25:23.009
"K.O.S." stands for "Kapping Off Suckers."

25:23.217 --> 25:24.719
We give out referrals.

25:24.927 --> 25:27.388
Don't disrespect my homeboy.
I don't like it.

25:27.805 --> 25:28.931
And he don't like you.

25:29.557 --> 25:30.600
Do me a favor.

25:30.808 --> 25:33.978
Go to the counter, get a paper towel
and wipe your desk off.

25:35.605 --> 25:36.981
And what's your name?

25:38.065 --> 25:39.233
Who, me?

25:39.567 --> 25:40.693
Stevie Littleton.

25:41.152 --> 25:44.155
You do me a favor, Mr. Littleton.
Turn that tagger shirt...

25:44.363 --> 25:46.240
inside out.

25:46.449 --> 25:47.658
What, this?

25:49.368 --> 25:50.870
Hyland said it was okay.

25:54.165 --> 25:55.541
Later, lover!

25:55.917 --> 25:58.503
It was a pleasure meeting you.

26:08.804 --> 26:11.265
They're just trying to fuck with you.

26:11.557 --> 26:13.684
I mean, play with you.

26:14.352 --> 26:17.688
- Sorry I said you had a nice ass.
- Apology accepted.

26:17.980 --> 26:19.565
But I ain't no schoolgirl.

26:19.774 --> 26:22.401
Heaven forbid I'd think that.

26:47.301 --> 26:48.386
May I come in?

26:48.636 --> 26:49.636
Sure.

26:54.475 --> 26:57.019
Making time a reward
instead of a distraction.

26:59.563 --> 27:02.275
I don't know why I jumped up
the way I did at lunch.

27:02.650 --> 27:04.735
It's just weird.

27:05.528 --> 27:06.737
It's all right.

27:08.239 --> 27:11.409
For what it's worth,
Childress thinks you walk on water.

27:13.911 --> 27:15.121
Is that a good thing?

27:15.496 --> 27:19.291
It takes a lot of courage to go
back into a classroom after that.

27:20.167 --> 27:22.795
Not if the only thing
you ever wanted was to teach.

27:24.130 --> 27:26.090
You see, there's our predicament.

27:31.012 --> 27:33.764
I assume you've met Benny Chacon.

27:34.724 --> 27:36.392
Yes, I have.

27:36.767 --> 27:37.810
Last week...

27:38.019 --> 27:40.229
Benny and his tagging crew...

27:40.438 --> 27:43.649
had Ms. Eskander
pinned in the corner over there.

27:44.275 --> 27:46.318
She's seven months pregnant.

27:47.319 --> 27:48.779
So she kicks him.

27:49.030 --> 27:52.324
If the district rules it an assault
on a student, she's gone.

27:53.075 --> 27:54.075
They'd do that?

27:55.286 --> 27:56.954
She's non-tenured.

27:57.413 --> 28:00.458
Wouldn't be surprised
if she files for stress leave.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.293
It's too bad.

28:03.252 --> 28:04.336
She was a good teacher.

28:08.674 --> 28:10.342
Can I ask a personal question?

28:13.220 --> 28:16.140
When you were attacked,
was it random or did you know him?

28:17.975 --> 28:20.269
No, I knew him. I flunked him.

28:20.853 --> 28:23.314
Can you see something like that coming?

28:24.398 --> 28:27.026
Kid tells you he wants to kill you,
believe him.

28:28.068 --> 28:30.738
He was an O.T., an opportunity transfer.

28:30.988 --> 28:33.491
But nobody told me that
till it was too late.

28:34.992 --> 28:36.452
Do you know Benny's an O.T.?

28:37.203 --> 28:40.581
Last year he was convicted of a felony
assault and suspended twice.

28:40.873 --> 28:43.626
I even testified against him
as a character witness.

28:44.126 --> 28:47.171
And now I get to see him
every morning in my homeroom.

28:48.964 --> 28:50.132
In your homeroom?

28:51.717 --> 28:55.471
Condition of his probation
is that he stay in school.

28:55.679 --> 28:58.307
- Did you talk to the principal?
- Many times.

28:58.933 --> 29:03.020
This kid's threatening me, and
all Garcia cares about is a lawsuit.

29:04.730 --> 29:06.065
What did Benny say to you?

29:08.943 --> 29:10.486
That he'd hurt me.

29:12.446 --> 29:13.446
Real bad.

29:15.533 --> 29:17.493
Someone calls my house every night...

29:17.701 --> 29:19.036
and hangs up.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.748
A couple of weeks ago,
they broke into my car.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.712
And on Friday, someone was in my house,
but I can't prove it.

29:30.130 --> 29:31.423
I don't know what to do.

29:33.133 --> 29:34.677
You can quit.

29:36.637 --> 29:37.930
You didn't.

30:50.461 --> 30:52.629
Hey, Picasso!

31:03.807 --> 31:05.976
What's up? You guys writers, or what?

31:06.560 --> 31:08.520
- You don't know me, fool?
- No, man.

31:08.771 --> 31:11.315
You should. You just fucked up my piece.

31:11.523 --> 31:12.941
You guys from K.O.S.?

31:13.150 --> 31:15.277
"K.O.S." Come on, nigga!

31:15.486 --> 31:18.238
- Yeah, we K.O.S., fool.
- Shut up!

31:18.447 --> 31:22.117
I got some silver in my sack.
I could just clean it up for you.

31:22.326 --> 31:23.786
I'll take care of it.

31:24.536 --> 31:25.913
Don't fuck with me.

31:26.121 --> 31:28.373
I might just have to bust
a cap in your ass.

31:28.540 --> 31:31.668
Come on, it's all about bombing,
getting citywide.

31:31.877 --> 31:33.128
Don't get all violent.

31:33.337 --> 31:35.339
Benny, don't be getting violent now.

31:36.173 --> 31:37.883
I said shut the fuck up!

31:44.056 --> 31:46.225
Yo, nigga, get away, man!

31:49.937 --> 31:51.146
Damn!

31:51.563 --> 31:53.232
I ain't got time for this shit.

31:54.942 --> 31:56.485
You think this is funny?

31:56.693 --> 31:59.488
If I don't call my P.O. In 15 minutes,
I'm fucked!

32:04.493 --> 32:06.745
Come on, let's get out of here.

32:07.579 --> 32:09.623
Benny, come on, man! Let's go!

32:10.999 --> 32:12.918
Come on, Paco, let's step.

32:26.890 --> 32:28.559
Benny Chacon?

32:32.688 --> 32:34.398
Benny's not here.

32:34.606 --> 32:36.567
I think he went AWOL.

32:40.612 --> 32:42.531
- Leonard Thomas?
- Here.

33:23.447 --> 33:24.948
Hi. How are you?

33:25.157 --> 33:27.409
Eskander did file for stress leave.

33:27.617 --> 33:29.786
They asked me to finish out the semester.

33:30.162 --> 33:31.913
That's great.

33:32.122 --> 33:34.041
Just till the end of the year.

33:35.334 --> 33:39.963
I wanted to thank you for letting me
cry on your shoulder the other day.

33:40.172 --> 33:41.423
It's all right.

33:42.716 --> 33:44.676
Have you seen Benny lately?

33:45.552 --> 33:48.138
His P.O. Says he hasn't
heard from him in 4 days.

33:48.347 --> 33:49.348
Really?

33:50.807 --> 33:53.310
They say, "Be careful what you pray for."

33:53.518 --> 33:56.605
Don't get me wrong.
Benny's made my life a living hell.

33:56.813 --> 33:59.399
I've moved in with my mother
because of him.

33:59.608 --> 34:02.360
I love her, but if I eat
one more dinner off the TV tray...

34:02.569 --> 34:06.698
or watch one more rerun of
Wheel of Fortune, I'll lose my mind.

34:07.616 --> 34:08.949
Time's up!

34:28.428 --> 34:30.764
When did a student last surprise you?

34:30.972 --> 34:33.891
When the light came on?
That's been a while.

34:35.726 --> 34:38.230
Don't you ever get lonely?

34:38.563 --> 34:40.107
Yeah, sometimes.

34:40.649 --> 34:43.527
There's this passage
in God's Lonely Man...

34:43.735 --> 34:46.196
by Thomas Wolfe where he says:

34:48.489 --> 34:51.243
"The whole conviction of my life
rests upon the belief...

34:51.451 --> 34:53.745
that loneliness is the central...

34:53.911 --> 34:56.748
and inevitable fact of human existence."

34:58.166 --> 35:00.460
That's really depressing, Trevor.

35:01.002 --> 35:04.089
It's just my New York upbringing.
It's not easy looking...

35:04.297 --> 35:06.091
on the bright side these days.

35:06.466 --> 35:10.262
You'd feel that way after spending
a year going in and out of hospitals.

35:10.428 --> 35:12.848
No, that wasn't that tough.

35:14.766 --> 35:16.184
The robbery.

35:16.434 --> 35:18.979
That was the hardest for me to get over.

35:19.187 --> 35:20.814
What'd they steal?

35:21.022 --> 35:23.149
My passion. The spark.

35:23.358 --> 35:27.153
My unguarded self. I miss them.
I want them back.

35:27.362 --> 35:29.781
If you ask me, they're still there.

35:30.949 --> 35:32.909
I think everyone else has given up.

35:33.118 --> 35:35.704
They're so beaten down.

35:35.912 --> 35:37.455
But you're different.

35:37.664 --> 35:39.749
You refuse to be beaten.

35:40.333 --> 35:41.333
Well, thank you.

35:45.463 --> 35:46.631
Where are you going?

35:46.840 --> 35:48.425
Got something for you.

35:52.470 --> 35:55.515
Did you know that
Cesar Sanchez is Special Ed?

35:55.724 --> 35:56.724
No.

35:56.766 --> 35:58.560
Yeah, he's S.E.D.

35:58.768 --> 36:01.271
Severely emotionally disturbed?

36:01.688 --> 36:03.231
That's great.

36:06.610 --> 36:08.111
I wanted you to have this.

36:26.838 --> 36:30.633
I can't believe...! You are so...

36:33.219 --> 36:36.890
When I go back on my right foot,
you come forward on your left.

36:37.098 --> 36:40.268
When I go forward on my left,
you're back on your right.

36:40.477 --> 36:41.644
He taught you that?

36:42.187 --> 36:44.522
- Fresh little kid.
- All part of the dance.

36:44.689 --> 36:46.274
Was he this fresh?

36:48.943 --> 36:49.986
I'm sorry!

36:50.195 --> 36:51.946
It's all right.

36:53.531 --> 36:54.574
Can I get something?

36:54.783 --> 36:57.202
Get the baking soda out of the kitchen.

36:57.410 --> 36:58.411
Sure.

36:59.412 --> 37:00.705
Where in the kitchen?

37:01.039 --> 37:02.374
The fridge.

37:03.583 --> 37:06.294
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

37:08.546 --> 37:11.758
Just when I was getting to be
a salsa king too, huh?

37:26.564 --> 37:28.566
Is this the Wheel of Fortune house?

37:29.067 --> 37:30.318
Yeah.

37:32.862 --> 37:34.197
Hey, Jack.

37:34.405 --> 37:36.116
Hey, sweetheart.

37:39.452 --> 37:41.996
You're a good dog. Yes, you are.

37:47.085 --> 37:49.879
I wanna apologize...

37:50.421 --> 37:52.757
for reacting the way that I did.

37:53.007 --> 37:55.760
You don't have to apologize.
Everybody reacts that way.

37:57.428 --> 37:59.097
Thanks for dinner.

37:59.848 --> 38:01.266
I had a really good time.

38:02.767 --> 38:04.018
You're welcome.

38:10.942 --> 38:12.235
You know...

38:14.821 --> 38:16.281
You know what you need?

38:16.531 --> 38:20.201
You need something to liven up your house.

38:26.541 --> 38:28.084
It flowers.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.131
Thanks.

38:35.133 --> 38:36.259
You're welcome.

38:39.929 --> 38:41.097
Good night.

38:42.265 --> 38:43.266
Good night.

39:55.630 --> 39:58.674
Since some of you are so
interested in pharmaceuticals...

39:59.008 --> 40:01.886
I thought I'd prepare
a little demonstration for you.

40:02.387 --> 40:03.387
Rita.

40:03.513 --> 40:05.848
Bring your friend in the cage
up here, please.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.979
His name is Snowball.

40:12.230 --> 40:15.191
Like that little pig dude
from Animal Farm.

40:15.566 --> 40:16.609
You read Animal Farm?

40:16.818 --> 40:18.027
Schoolgirl!

40:18.236 --> 40:19.362
Shut up, Cesar!

40:19.987 --> 40:21.697
You read Animal Farm, Cesar?

40:21.906 --> 40:24.200
No. But I fucked a sheep once.

40:24.409 --> 40:26.160
We heard that, homes.

40:26.369 --> 40:27.537
That shit is sick.

40:29.330 --> 40:30.330
Cesar, come here.

40:30.581 --> 40:33.000
I want you to have
a front row sit for this.

40:37.964 --> 40:39.048
Lose the lokes.

40:43.636 --> 40:45.096
Why are your eyes so red?

40:45.263 --> 40:47.890
I was up late studying all night, Mr. G.

40:48.099 --> 40:49.225
Yeah, right.

40:50.101 --> 40:51.894
That's a nice watch.

40:52.436 --> 40:53.436
Can I have it?

40:54.063 --> 40:55.231
Sit down.

40:57.733 --> 40:59.485
I want you to read Young's Rule.

40:59.694 --> 41:02.071
Page 564. Top of the page.

41:02.280 --> 41:04.365
- I ain't reading that shit.
- Rita...

41:04.574 --> 41:06.409
give Cesar your book so he can read.

41:06.617 --> 41:09.245
Forget it! I ain't reading that shit.

41:09.787 --> 41:11.789
- Stupid chunt!
- Stupid bitch!

41:12.373 --> 41:14.292
Just read it, man!

41:19.547 --> 41:20.798
Read.

41:21.174 --> 41:22.758
Please.

41:31.684 --> 41:34.145
"Young's Rule..."

41:38.482 --> 41:39.609
Formulates.

41:40.151 --> 41:41.694
"formulates..."

41:48.701 --> 41:50.244
Settle down!

41:51.120 --> 41:52.955
Settle down, people.

41:53.497 --> 41:54.749
Fuck you guys!

41:56.834 --> 41:57.835
It's all right.

41:58.252 --> 41:59.795
You'll get another chance.

42:06.510 --> 42:11.265
I have in this brown bottle
a prescription for liquid Demerol.

42:11.474 --> 42:12.516
Where'd you get that?

42:12.725 --> 42:14.518
This came out of my private stash.

42:15.811 --> 42:20.191
Demerol is a morphine sulfate.
It is soluble in water.

42:21.150 --> 42:23.110
Young's Rule says:

42:23.444 --> 42:25.196
Divide the age of the patient...

42:25.404 --> 42:28.074
by the patient's age plus 12...

42:28.491 --> 42:30.034
thus giving you...

42:30.826 --> 42:34.497
the correct fraction of the adult
dosage suitable for the patient.

42:35.331 --> 42:37.166
In Snowball's case...

42:37.375 --> 42:40.211
I calculated the dosage
for a 1-year-old child.

42:51.305 --> 42:55.017
He should be awake in about 10 minutes.

43:09.657 --> 43:10.783
He's dead, isn't he?

43:10.991 --> 43:12.910
I hope he did die!

43:15.955 --> 43:17.581
He should've woke up by now.

43:17.790 --> 43:19.834
You just caught yourself a murder case.

43:28.717 --> 43:30.594
Everyone who didn't answer...

43:30.803 --> 43:33.848
the questions on page 264,
please do so tonight.

43:39.270 --> 43:40.270
Cesar!

43:41.897 --> 43:42.897
Hold it.

43:43.607 --> 43:44.817
Where's my watch?

43:45.025 --> 43:46.777
I ain't got no watch. I gotta go.

43:46.986 --> 43:49.280
Come here! Empty your pockets!

43:49.488 --> 43:52.992
Let me put it to you like this.
I gotta catch a bus. All right?

44:05.337 --> 44:07.339
I have to see Hyland before he leaves.

44:07.548 --> 44:08.841
I've been meaning to see you.

44:09.049 --> 44:11.886
It's been a week. You must be avoiding me.

44:13.304 --> 44:14.638
Are you okay?

44:22.396 --> 44:25.774
It's pretty much been like this
since my accident.

44:26.108 --> 44:29.195
But it has nothing to do with you.

44:31.655 --> 44:33.115
I gotta go.

44:34.700 --> 44:36.243
Can you do me a favor?

44:37.912 --> 44:42.625
When you finish, can you give me a ride
to my car? It's at the mechanic's.

44:42.791 --> 44:45.127
If you can't, it's okay. I can walk.

44:45.336 --> 44:46.795
I can manage that.

44:47.755 --> 44:48.755
Thanks.

44:48.797 --> 44:50.883
Base 1 to Base 3. I found him.

44:51.425 --> 44:53.636
Mr. Garcia would like
to see you in his office.

45:08.317 --> 45:09.818
Thanks for coming in.

45:10.152 --> 45:12.655
Sorry we have to meet
under such circumstances.

45:15.240 --> 45:19.078
You don't mind if we tape-record
our conversation? Matter of record.

45:19.662 --> 45:22.498
You know Mr. Hyland, right?
Your teachers' union rep.

45:22.998 --> 45:24.625
Am I being questioned?

45:24.875 --> 45:28.587
They say you've accused them
of stealing your watch.

45:28.796 --> 45:32.841
And if that's the case, I need
to address the accusation.

45:33.676 --> 45:36.470
Beginning of 6th period,
Cesar admired my watch.

45:36.679 --> 45:40.349
I believe his exact words were
"Can I have it?"

45:40.975 --> 45:43.394
Bottom line is, I'd like my watch back.

45:43.727 --> 45:44.853
Anything else?

45:45.187 --> 45:47.815
I asked him to empty his pockets
and he refused.

45:48.023 --> 45:49.023
Is that true?

45:49.149 --> 45:50.901
No way! He never asked me that!

45:51.110 --> 45:54.113
I don't go around taxing teachers.
I got no damn watch!

45:54.321 --> 45:55.489
Calm down.

45:56.281 --> 45:57.700
Empty your pockets now.

46:01.662 --> 46:04.498
Mr. Littleton, may we see
what's in your pockets too?

46:08.085 --> 46:09.378
I'd like a locker search.

46:10.921 --> 46:13.882
Good. I could use the money.
I'll sue your ass.

46:14.091 --> 46:16.260
You're excused, gentlemen.

46:16.468 --> 46:18.887
Take your things, please.
Thank you very much.

46:26.311 --> 46:27.563
Do you have the time?

46:28.605 --> 46:31.775
It's 3:22, Mr. Sanchez.

46:31.984 --> 46:33.402
3:22. Thanks.

46:36.029 --> 46:39.408
Mr. Garfield, let me try
to explain something.

46:39.616 --> 46:43.704
I work very hard to try and think
of our students here at Adams...

46:43.912 --> 46:44.912
as my clients.

46:45.122 --> 46:48.417
We can't have another lawsuit
like we had on that Blackwell case.

46:48.625 --> 46:52.087
That one cost the district
a quarter of a million dollars.

46:53.464 --> 46:55.757
So I need you to be straight with me.

46:56.508 --> 46:59.386
Did you physically see Cesar
take your watch?

46:59.595 --> 47:01.805
No, I didn't.

47:02.431 --> 47:03.724
Gentlemen...

47:04.975 --> 47:09.229
unless we have reasonable cause
to show they took your watch...

47:09.438 --> 47:11.273
I can't authorize a locker search.

47:13.275 --> 47:14.275
Sorry.

47:14.776 --> 47:18.155
That was my grandfather's watch.
Can't you see what they're doing?

47:18.363 --> 47:19.490
Didn't you ever teach?

47:19.698 --> 47:22.034
I'm afraid I never had the privilege.

47:22.242 --> 47:26.079
Teaching and being a principal
don't necessarily go hand in hand.

47:26.288 --> 47:27.956
That's beside the point...

47:29.416 --> 47:30.876
Have a good day.

47:39.718 --> 47:41.094
Why didn't you say something?

47:41.303 --> 47:44.598
The asshole's a politician.
He's got every angle covered.

47:45.390 --> 47:49.061
- I'm thinking of videotaping my classes.
- You want some free advice?

47:49.269 --> 47:50.938
Cover your ass.

47:51.396 --> 47:56.276
If Garcia asks, the camera's purpose
is to observe you, not the students.

47:56.652 --> 47:58.487
I mean his "clients."

47:58.695 --> 48:00.989
Some gangbanger might think...

48:01.156 --> 48:04.034
we're violating his civil rights.

48:05.827 --> 48:08.288
Sorry, Iris, completely forgot.

48:08.497 --> 48:09.497
Right.

48:11.291 --> 48:14.378
I wanna talk to you
about the discipline committee.

48:14.586 --> 48:16.338
I gotta make a run up to the office.

48:16.672 --> 48:18.090
Go ahead. I can wait.

48:49.079 --> 48:51.498
I have to fly up there
for a computer conference.

48:51.707 --> 48:52.541
When's that?

48:52.708 --> 48:54.167
Day after tomorrow.

48:56.128 --> 48:58.171
I've never been to San Francisco.

48:58.380 --> 49:00.674
You should go sometime.
You'd really like it.

49:00.882 --> 49:04.261
It's only about an hour by air,
or five or six by car...

49:04.469 --> 49:07.431
but it has a totally
different attitude than L.A.

49:07.889 --> 49:11.101
The only problem is,
I hate to leave Jack with my mother.

49:11.309 --> 49:15.147
I'm afraid that she'll forget
to feed him and he'll starve to death.

49:16.857 --> 49:21.528
So anyway, San Francisco's more like
a real city, like Chicago or New York.

49:23.113 --> 49:24.740
Or Baghdad...

49:25.449 --> 49:27.033
or Mars.

49:29.494 --> 49:32.289
I'll take care of Jack for you
while you're gone.

50:10.660 --> 50:12.537
Aren't you supposed to be in P.E.?

50:12.746 --> 50:16.082
These boys are tripping, man!
Old lady's fucked up!

50:17.083 --> 50:20.545
- I gotta make J.C. Next year. I got to!
- Calm down.

50:20.795 --> 50:22.339
I'll never get out of here!

50:22.547 --> 50:25.383
That bitch, Quinn!
I'm gonna sue her ass. I swear to God!

50:25.592 --> 50:27.469
Okay, Rita, slow down.

50:27.928 --> 50:29.179
What's she teach?

50:29.387 --> 50:31.431
English Comp. She's failing me!

50:31.640 --> 50:34.684
She hates me! She's racist against me!

50:34.893 --> 50:36.436
Just because you're Latina...

50:36.978 --> 50:38.063
I'm Chicana!

50:38.271 --> 50:40.440
Okay. Chicana.

50:40.899 --> 50:43.985
Stop blaming everybody else.
You're too smart for that.

50:44.194 --> 50:47.280
Whatever's wrong with that essay
is correctable.

50:47.614 --> 50:48.615
May I see it?

50:51.493 --> 50:53.328
Use some of that tissue there.

50:57.415 --> 50:59.334
Why do you wear so much makeup?

51:00.669 --> 51:03.630
- To make me pretty.
- You don't need it.

51:06.216 --> 51:07.216
Who's Puppet?

51:08.093 --> 51:09.636
Nothing.

51:10.303 --> 51:12.347
It's a gang thing...

51:13.682 --> 51:15.475
but I'm kicking that shit.

51:16.393 --> 51:20.438
Because I look like I'm down for my
neighborhood don't mean I'm stupid.

51:30.740 --> 51:33.618
The ideas in your essay
aren't the problem.

51:38.415 --> 51:41.042
It's your punctuation and grammar.

51:42.252 --> 51:44.754
They need work. Am I lying?

51:47.632 --> 51:49.884
If you need help, I'm here for you.

51:52.220 --> 51:53.220
I don't know.

51:53.346 --> 51:54.848
"I don't know"?

51:55.140 --> 51:56.516
Why'd you come here?

51:59.477 --> 52:02.480
Look, we can meet in the library,
all right?

52:03.106 --> 52:04.691
Somebody might see us.

52:04.899 --> 52:06.359
I'll come to your house.

52:06.568 --> 52:07.777
No way.

52:11.865 --> 52:13.575
You pick a place.

52:19.080 --> 52:20.498
You want something to drink?

52:20.707 --> 52:22.000
I got...

52:22.208 --> 52:24.502
Coke, Sprite, juice.

52:24.711 --> 52:26.713
Cola's all right.

52:30.842 --> 52:35.472
You know, you're not the only one
whose reputation's on the line here.

52:36.097 --> 52:39.142
I don't normally tutor students
at my house.

52:42.979 --> 52:46.983
Since you're here, maybe you can
clear something up for me.

52:47.192 --> 52:50.945
This whole machismo code-of-honor thing.

52:51.154 --> 52:52.614
I mean, come on...

52:52.822 --> 52:55.909
is pride really worth dying for?

53:01.247 --> 53:02.582
Put your clothes on.

53:35.990 --> 53:38.284
Okay, okay. No harm done.

53:40.537 --> 53:42.497
Come on, come on, come on. Don't cry.

53:44.290 --> 53:46.251
I just wanted to thank you.

53:53.007 --> 53:55.343
You don't have to thank me.
I'm your teacher.

53:58.721 --> 54:01.683
Maybe we'd better meet in the library
from now on, okay?

54:08.481 --> 54:10.441
Hey, homey, what's up with that?

54:11.192 --> 54:12.360
Dog!

54:12.569 --> 54:15.071
You invading my privacy, bitch!

54:15.446 --> 54:17.782
Cesar, come up here.

54:18.449 --> 54:19.659
Shit!

54:19.867 --> 54:22.662
I hope you ain't sending this shit
to Most Wanted.

54:23.579 --> 54:26.165
Let me fix my shit so I look good.

54:29.377 --> 54:33.840
Since you were so concerned about
my watch, you might like to know...

54:34.132 --> 54:35.216
I found it.

54:38.511 --> 54:40.513
You broke into my locker, Mr. G.

54:40.722 --> 54:42.515
It's a serious felony.

54:42.724 --> 54:44.684
Caught yourself a case for sure now.

54:44.892 --> 54:45.893
Really?

54:46.102 --> 54:48.229
And what do you propose to do?

54:48.438 --> 54:49.981
Tell Garcia?

54:50.189 --> 54:52.025
And what are you gonna tell him?

54:52.233 --> 54:56.529
That I broke into your locker and
stole the watch that you denied taking?

54:56.738 --> 54:58.781
I don't think so.

54:58.990 --> 55:01.200
What do you say we call this even?

55:02.910 --> 55:05.747
I say we just getting started, Mr. G.

55:09.417 --> 55:12.420
Maybe I'll have someone
from the office call your mother.

55:12.628 --> 55:15.923
I thought you knew.
Us poor Mexicans, we don't got phones.

55:31.105 --> 55:32.523
I'll try.

56:52.562 --> 56:54.230
I ain't getting that door.

56:56.732 --> 56:58.025
You hear me?

57:15.293 --> 57:17.169
What the hell you doing here?

57:17.378 --> 57:19.297
I didn't say you could come to my house.

57:19.505 --> 57:20.840
Look, Cesar.

57:21.549 --> 57:24.343
I came here to see
if we could squash all this.

57:24.552 --> 57:26.971
You ain't got no motherfucking right!

57:27.179 --> 57:28.472
Get the hell out of here!

57:28.681 --> 57:30.391
Why don't we just start over?

58:36.040 --> 58:38.667
Puto, you lied to my homeboy Benny.

58:38.876 --> 58:40.836
You told him you speak no Spanish.

58:41.045 --> 58:43.923
- No, I didn't.
- That's fucking bullshit, ese!

58:44.298 --> 58:46.258
You like hitting on your mother, Cesar?

58:46.467 --> 58:47.927
You must be proud of yourself.

58:48.094 --> 58:49.887
- What's he talking about?
- He's lying.

58:50.179 --> 58:51.764
Fucking mentiroso!

58:52.014 --> 58:56.060
Homeboy don't never lie
to his jefita! Never disrespects!

58:56.268 --> 58:57.268
Whatever you say.

58:57.436 --> 59:00.106
Do whatever I say!
I'll find where you live!

59:01.857 --> 59:04.318
The party's getting started, homes!

59:07.613 --> 59:10.282
Get your fucking ass out of here!

59:27.508 --> 59:30.010
Look at this. Look at this shit.

59:32.263 --> 59:33.305
Man!

59:33.514 --> 59:36.058
Whoever did this is gonna pay.

59:36.267 --> 59:38.602
You better believe it, eses.

59:42.064 --> 59:43.107
Get out of here!

59:43.315 --> 59:45.150
Get these kids out of here!

59:46.652 --> 59:47.652
Barsek?

59:48.237 --> 59:49.989
Don't touch anything!

59:54.785 --> 59:56.245
Look at the rat, man.

59:58.664 --> 01:00:02.126
What? "Look at the rat, man."
You think that's funny?

01:00:02.334 --> 01:00:05.671
Did you do that?
Did you do that to that rat?

01:00:07.298 --> 01:00:08.299
Let him go!

01:00:08.507 --> 01:00:13.429
He didn't do anything! He's a good kid!
You act like this is your place!

01:00:16.056 --> 01:00:18.225
Maybe you should take care of your place!

01:00:18.434 --> 01:00:19.977
Now get out of here!

01:00:20.185 --> 01:00:22.396
Get the hell out of here, you assholes!

01:00:24.231 --> 01:00:25.316
That's him now.

01:00:25.524 --> 01:00:27.318
Come on, Bogart.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.946
That shit is bad, bro.

01:00:37.328 --> 01:00:39.830
Put that shit out, man.
Here comes Garfield.

01:00:41.582 --> 01:00:43.542
You smoking the chronic, Cesar?

01:00:44.501 --> 01:00:47.212
No, man. I ain't hooked on chronic.

01:00:47.379 --> 01:00:48.881
I'm hooked on phonics.

01:00:50.466 --> 01:00:53.510
You wouldn't know who vandalized
Bungalow 86, would you?

01:00:53.886 --> 01:00:57.556
Bungalow 86?
You guys know about Bungalow 86?

01:01:00.225 --> 01:01:01.225
Sorry, maestro.

01:01:01.643 --> 01:01:02.686
Nada.

01:01:04.563 --> 01:01:05.689
You know...

01:01:06.023 --> 01:01:08.901
Garcia may not be able
to prove anything...

01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:12.488
but you and I both know
who's responsible, don't we?

01:01:13.697 --> 01:01:17.493
I'm serious, man. I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

01:01:19.578 --> 01:01:20.578
The ring, Cesar.

01:01:21.121 --> 01:01:22.121
Give it to me.

01:01:23.123 --> 01:01:25.918
You better watch it, man.
That's my trigger finger.

01:01:26.126 --> 01:01:27.419
It's inappropriate attire!

01:01:29.922 --> 01:01:31.090
Are you finished?

01:01:31.298 --> 01:01:33.384
What? Am I finished?

01:01:33.592 --> 01:01:36.678
Is that what you said?
Don't try to get crazy on me.

01:01:36.887 --> 01:01:38.806
You wanna bring it on, let's go!

01:01:42.601 --> 01:01:44.228
What you gonna do?

01:01:54.947 --> 01:01:56.949
Get the fuck out of here!

01:01:57.741 --> 01:01:59.326
Fucking bitch!

01:02:15.968 --> 01:02:19.304
These conferences mainly focus
on software now.

01:02:19.513 --> 01:02:22.099
Yeah, well, software sells.

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:29.356
How's Jack?

01:02:29.565 --> 01:02:30.899
Jack's good.

01:02:33.402 --> 01:02:36.655
And how's Trevor?
Has Trevor been behaving himself?

01:02:36.864 --> 01:02:38.657
What's that supposed to mean?

01:02:39.867 --> 01:02:43.412
- Is that supposed to mean something?
- It doesn't mean anything.

01:02:49.167 --> 01:02:51.086
I'm talking to the lady! All right?

01:03:10.355 --> 01:03:11.982
Sorry, all right?

01:03:14.443 --> 01:03:15.652
Forgive me?

01:03:29.666 --> 01:03:31.418
- Should I grab this?
- Later.

01:03:31.627 --> 01:03:33.170
Do you wanna see Jack?

01:03:33.962 --> 01:03:35.380
Jack, your mommy's home!

01:03:35.714 --> 01:03:36.882
Come here, Jack!

01:03:37.841 --> 01:03:39.176
Come on, sweetheart.

01:03:39.718 --> 01:03:40.927
Here, boy!

01:03:42.763 --> 01:03:46.058
It's weird. Usually
he just comes when I call.

01:03:50.562 --> 01:03:51.938
He's right back here.

01:03:56.401 --> 01:03:57.527
Oh, my God!

01:03:59.571 --> 01:04:00.989
Oh, my God! Jack!

01:04:03.367 --> 01:04:04.910
Don't look! Don't!

01:04:06.745 --> 01:04:07.871
Let me get to him!

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.331
Don't look!

01:04:09.539 --> 01:04:10.999
Oh, my God!

01:04:13.794 --> 01:04:15.587
Don't beat yourself up too much.

01:04:16.755 --> 01:04:19.216
Whatever it was, he jumped over the fence.

01:04:22.177 --> 01:04:23.428
What can you do?

01:05:11.685 --> 01:05:12.686
Aspirin?

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:16.231
Thanks.

01:05:30.078 --> 01:05:32.831
You know, Trevor,
I don't think that I can...

01:05:34.958 --> 01:05:36.877
talk to you right now.

01:05:37.586 --> 01:05:39.713
I'm so upset that I can't even drive.

01:05:39.921 --> 01:05:43.091
I just think it would
just be best if you just...

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:44.885
If I was just alone.

01:05:54.186 --> 01:05:55.645
I'm sorry, Ellen.

01:06:55.664 --> 01:06:57.791
Paco, is that you?

01:07:07.717 --> 01:07:09.594
Stupid gato.

01:07:27.195 --> 01:07:29.572
Stupid Indians.

01:07:39.833 --> 01:07:43.628
They got some good shit!

01:08:26.004 --> 01:08:27.796
Where's the aspirin?

01:09:48.211 --> 01:09:50.212
Come on, you can do better than that.

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:53.131
I put it on my mother, detective.

01:09:53.341 --> 01:09:56.761
So your teacher drugged you,
then chopped off your finger?

01:09:57.303 --> 01:09:58.388
Yeah, it had to be him.

01:09:58.596 --> 01:10:00.473
He smoked the mota for you too?

01:10:00.682 --> 01:10:03.017
Fucking nigger hates my guts! All right?

01:10:03.226 --> 01:10:05.228
Who you covering for, homes?

01:10:05.436 --> 01:10:08.898
This circumstantial bullshit
ain't gonna hold up in court.

01:10:09.107 --> 01:10:11.442
Too many priors: Juvenile GTA, vandalism.

01:10:11.651 --> 01:10:13.820
I know it was him! Listen to me, man!

01:10:14.028 --> 01:10:16.364
- You saw his face?
- Yeah, I saw his face!

01:10:16.572 --> 01:10:18.700
Let me save you from perjuring yourself.

01:10:18.908 --> 01:10:19.951
You're full of shit.

01:10:20.159 --> 01:10:21.994
I swear to God, I know it was him.

01:10:22.203 --> 01:10:24.080
This guy's wasting our time.

01:10:24.288 --> 01:10:27.083
You come up with the truth,
you give us a call.

01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:28.291
Later, homes.

01:10:29.293 --> 01:10:30.753
File it under B, man.

01:10:30.962 --> 01:10:32.296
"Bullshit."

01:10:53.818 --> 01:10:55.027
All right.

01:10:55.236 --> 01:10:57.238
Name one of the four parts...

01:10:57.447 --> 01:10:59.365
that make up the human hand.

01:10:59.782 --> 01:11:01.409
Hands, please.

01:11:01.784 --> 01:11:02.827
Christian?

01:11:05.246 --> 01:11:06.247
Metacarpals?

01:11:06.497 --> 01:11:08.666
That's good. Anyone else? Rita.

01:11:08.875 --> 01:11:11.335
The wrist and thumb.

01:11:11.502 --> 01:11:12.712
Very good!

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.465
Come on, there's one more
very important part.

01:11:15.673 --> 01:11:17.091
One more!

01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:20.178
Phalanges! Phalanges!

01:11:20.386 --> 01:11:22.096
Everybody wiggle your phalanges.

01:11:22.305 --> 01:11:24.599
Please!

01:11:24.807 --> 01:11:29.562
Everybody wiggle them.
You too, "G's" in the back. Phalanges!

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:39.070
Can I come in?

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:40.781
Hi!

01:11:41.407 --> 01:11:43.367
What happened to you the other night?

01:11:43.826 --> 01:11:45.661
I was gonna ask you the same question.

01:11:46.204 --> 01:11:47.288
I went for a run.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.790
You wanna go for Chinese later?

01:11:49.999 --> 01:11:52.043
There's a new place. I hear it's good.

01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:55.463
You know, I just...

01:11:55.713 --> 01:11:58.507
I've got all this stuff
I have to put into the computer.

01:11:58.716 --> 01:12:01.010
Maybe some other time.

01:12:02.136 --> 01:12:03.137
Sure.

01:12:03.888 --> 01:12:06.098
I probably need to grade some papers.

01:12:06.933 --> 01:12:09.977
Some of those kids are starting
to care about a grade.

01:12:10.186 --> 01:12:11.186
Even Cesar.

01:12:11.229 --> 01:12:15.107
Today, for the first time since I took
over for Eskander, he did some work.

01:12:20.363 --> 01:12:21.405
You all right?

01:12:23.074 --> 01:12:25.409
I'm much better. Thanks.

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.380
Finished.

01:12:39.674 --> 01:12:40.925
Mr. G.? Finished.

01:12:45.763 --> 01:12:47.098
It's broken.

01:12:47.431 --> 01:12:50.059
It doesn't work.
I need three copies of this article!

01:12:50.393 --> 01:12:53.604
You know, since your essay
deals with gangs...

01:12:53.813 --> 01:12:58.526
you probably could've left in
some of those double negatives you like.

01:12:58.734 --> 01:13:00.486
So now you want me to use bad grammar?

01:13:00.695 --> 01:13:02.530
Only when it suits your topic.

01:13:03.406 --> 01:13:06.367
I know. We're all
products of our environment.

01:13:08.119 --> 01:13:11.038
I think everybody's responsible
for their own actions.

01:13:12.665 --> 01:13:14.917
Now, see, this is like hip-hop.

01:13:15.126 --> 01:13:18.921
If you take out all the bad grammar
it loses its impact.

01:13:19.964 --> 01:13:21.757
You like hip-hop, Mr. G?

01:13:21.924 --> 01:13:23.175
No, I hate it.

01:13:23.968 --> 01:13:25.720
What kind of black man are you?

01:13:27.304 --> 01:13:29.306
This really is a good essay.

01:13:29.515 --> 01:13:31.809
You put in a lot of work. It shows.

01:13:32.309 --> 01:13:33.769
Thanks, maestro.

01:13:34.353 --> 01:13:35.646
It comes from the heart.

01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:38.399
You think I could be...

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.901
a writer?

01:13:43.738 --> 01:13:48.075
Miss Quinn picks two seniors to read
their essays every year at graduation.

01:13:49.285 --> 01:13:51.162
She ain't gonna pick mine!

01:13:51.495 --> 01:13:54.290
I don't wanna get up
in front of all those people.

01:13:54.498 --> 01:13:57.293
- Make a fool out of myself.
- Really? Why?

01:13:57.501 --> 01:14:00.129
You afraid it might be
some kind of Pyrrhic victory?

01:14:00.337 --> 01:14:01.380
What's that?

01:14:03.382 --> 01:14:04.633
Tell you what...

01:14:04.842 --> 01:14:06.385
look it up.

01:14:27.364 --> 01:14:28.824
You see, you can't do that.

01:14:29.033 --> 01:14:31.118
Either you'd need different software...

01:14:31.327 --> 01:14:34.663
or you'd have to sweep your
hard drive, taking two days.

01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:38.083
Before we get sidetracked
with viruses and TSR programs...

01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:40.920
yesterday we were talking about e-mail.

01:14:41.128 --> 01:14:45.132
So if you click the icon
at the bottom of your screen...

01:14:45.341 --> 01:14:47.635
you'll be able to send and receive mail.

01:14:47.968 --> 01:14:49.929
Go ahead and click the white envelope.

01:14:50.137 --> 01:14:51.137
You've got mail.

01:14:54.433 --> 01:14:56.769
Okay, someone's way ahead of me.
All right.

01:14:56.977 --> 01:14:58.354
Double click "open/read."

01:15:28.634 --> 01:15:31.845
That person isn't as anonymous
as they think they are.

01:15:42.982 --> 01:15:44.608
You've got mail.

01:15:53.242 --> 01:15:54.368
That's bullshit!

01:15:55.661 --> 01:15:57.079
Better step off, Mrs. H!

01:15:57.246 --> 01:15:59.540
You can't fucking prove anything!

01:16:00.416 --> 01:16:04.044
And I know you can't afford
to lose this minimum-wage job of yours.

01:16:05.462 --> 01:16:07.047
You know, you're right.

01:16:07.256 --> 01:16:11.051
I can't afford to live in a big house
south of the boulevard like you do.

01:16:13.053 --> 01:16:14.221
Fuck you!

01:16:21.687 --> 01:16:24.398
- Have you seen Stevie Littleton?
- No, haven't seen him.

01:16:24.606 --> 01:16:27.317
You're not supposed to leave
your classroom unattended.

01:16:27.526 --> 01:16:28.819
Sue me!

01:16:31.071 --> 01:16:32.531
Benny Chacon's mother.

01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:36.368
I told her Garcia had to leave early,
but she just sits there.

01:16:36.577 --> 01:16:39.288
She's been saying
some pretty crazy things.

01:16:47.963 --> 01:16:48.963
Mrs. Chacon?

01:16:50.299 --> 01:16:52.885
I'm Ellen Henry. Benny's in my class.

01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:59.641
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

01:17:04.521 --> 01:17:05.606
What is she saying?

01:17:05.814 --> 01:17:08.484
You heard about that body
they found in the L.A. River?

01:17:08.692 --> 01:17:10.819
She says she thinks it's Benny.

01:17:42.476 --> 01:17:45.604
You say he's been missing
approximately four weeks?

01:17:45.813 --> 01:17:47.022
Four or five weeks.

01:17:48.482 --> 01:17:49.482
She speak English?

01:17:49.817 --> 01:17:50.817
No.

01:17:50.859 --> 01:17:53.862
We get 80 to 90 bodies a month sometimes.

01:17:54.071 --> 01:17:55.656
Gangbangers, illegals...

01:17:55.864 --> 01:17:56.990
floaters.

01:17:57.366 --> 01:17:59.535
Nobody's even looking for them.

01:18:00.577 --> 01:18:05.207
But if you ask me, this kid was dead
before he got his head caved in.

01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:08.043
Overdose of morphine.
That's what it looks like to me.

01:18:09.753 --> 01:18:12.005
On the phone you said that...

01:18:12.589 --> 01:18:15.217
the mother mentioned
some identifying marks.

01:18:15.425 --> 01:18:16.593
Yes.

01:18:16.802 --> 01:18:20.764
She said he had pockmarks on his chest
from a bad case of chicken pox...

01:18:20.973 --> 01:18:24.059
and a bar-code tattoo
on the back of his neck.

01:18:49.376 --> 01:18:52.087
Did you find any rosary beads on the body?

01:18:52.296 --> 01:18:53.297
No.

01:19:05.267 --> 01:19:06.268
Who is it?

01:19:06.435 --> 01:19:07.853
It's me.

01:19:13.275 --> 01:19:14.609
What's the matter?

01:19:15.485 --> 01:19:18.071
I just want you to tell me one thing.

01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:29.041
If you had any idea what I was thinking
lately, you'd think I was crazy.

01:19:34.296 --> 01:19:37.257
You remember the body
that they found in the L.A. River?

01:19:42.554 --> 01:19:43.554
It was Benny.

01:19:47.142 --> 01:19:48.226
Who told you that?

01:19:50.353 --> 01:19:52.355
Benny's mother identified the body.

01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:01.948
You know Benny was no saint.

01:20:05.243 --> 01:20:06.912
He hurt a lot of people.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:10.791
Before we go shedding tears over him,
we should remember that.

01:20:12.542 --> 01:20:15.837
In an odd sort of way
he may be better off.

01:20:16.046 --> 01:20:17.047
I know we are.

01:20:18.882 --> 01:20:21.551
Don't you feel safer with Benny gone?

01:20:21.843 --> 01:20:23.512
Don't you think he deserved to...

01:20:27.933 --> 01:20:30.018
You don't know anything...

01:20:30.685 --> 01:20:32.562
about Cesar's finger, do you?

01:20:36.066 --> 01:20:37.192
Did you know...

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.653
Cesar beats his mother?

01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:44.324
He was here the night Jack died.
In the back.

01:20:44.533 --> 01:20:46.117
What are you talking about?

01:20:47.202 --> 01:20:50.831
Jack was provoked.
It was no accident. Cesar killed him.

01:20:52.374 --> 01:20:56.127
What happened to Cesar was inevitable.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:00.882
At some point, people have to take
responsibility for their actions.

01:21:01.091 --> 01:21:03.552
I mean, he and Benny were takers.

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.762
They want what they want
when they want it.

01:21:06.388 --> 01:21:09.182
And we can't expect the system
to protect us.

01:21:25.115 --> 01:21:27.367
Where did you get these?

01:21:35.375 --> 01:21:37.294
I admire you.

01:21:38.086 --> 01:21:41.172
Like you, I used to think
the world was this great place...

01:21:41.381 --> 01:21:44.509
where everybody lived
by the same standard I did.

01:21:46.511 --> 01:21:48.305
Then some kid with a nail...

01:21:48.513 --> 01:21:51.057
showed me I was living in his world.

01:21:52.017 --> 01:21:55.186
A world where chaos rules, not order.

01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:58.565
A world where righteousness
is not rewarded.

01:21:59.649 --> 01:22:01.610
That's Cesar's world.

01:22:02.736 --> 01:22:05.530
And if you're not willing
to play by his rules...

01:22:06.114 --> 01:22:08.575
then you're gonna have to pay the price.

01:22:22.005 --> 01:22:23.423
I don't know you.

01:22:26.134 --> 01:22:28.178
I don't know who you are.

01:22:31.139 --> 01:22:32.766
I don't know you!

01:22:34.642 --> 01:22:36.811
You do know me. I'm a teacher.

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.939
Just like you.

01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:11.179
I'm talking to you, Garfield.

01:23:11.346 --> 01:23:13.181
I know what you did to Cesar.

01:23:13.598 --> 01:23:15.683
I'm thinking maybe you did Benny too.

01:23:17.519 --> 01:23:19.145
Is that possible?

01:23:20.522 --> 01:23:22.148
Did you bash his skull in?

01:23:22.357 --> 01:23:23.942
What did you fuck him up with?

01:23:24.484 --> 01:23:25.819
You killed my friend!

01:23:27.737 --> 01:23:28.905
Let me by.

01:23:29.114 --> 01:23:30.406
I want an answer!

01:23:31.491 --> 01:23:32.742
Leave me alone!

01:23:32.951 --> 01:23:34.744
I'll kill you...

01:24:15.034 --> 01:24:16.160
Schoolgirl bitch!

01:24:16.911 --> 01:24:18.955
What the fuck is your problem?

01:24:19.163 --> 01:24:20.498
You're fucking maestro!

01:24:20.707 --> 01:24:21.833
What you talking about?

01:24:22.041 --> 01:24:24.043
- Garfield killed Benny.
- You're crazy!

01:24:24.252 --> 01:24:27.171
Don't turn your back
when I'm talking! Come here!

01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:29.424
You think you better than everybody else?

01:24:29.632 --> 01:24:31.301
Because you ain't!

01:24:31.509 --> 01:24:32.509
Shut up!

01:24:32.552 --> 01:24:34.888
You forget all the good times we had?

01:24:35.096 --> 01:24:37.390
We all had our time with you.

01:24:38.057 --> 01:24:40.184
What the fuck you fucking that nigger for?

01:24:40.393 --> 01:24:41.728
You think he'll protect you?

01:24:41.936 --> 01:24:44.147
Keep me from doing what I want with you?

01:24:45.773 --> 01:24:48.568
Fuck you! Stupid little bitch!

01:24:51.529 --> 01:24:53.489
You want some meat on a roll?

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.408
Come on!

01:24:58.494 --> 01:24:59.787
Rita!

01:25:09.714 --> 01:25:11.924
Garfield better watch his back!

01:25:19.474 --> 01:25:21.100
What the fuck you gonna do?

01:25:21.601 --> 01:25:23.144
Fuck you, bitch!

01:25:24.687 --> 01:25:28.733
The death of Benito Chacon
is not gang-related.

01:25:29.984 --> 01:25:33.446
That is something you heard on the news.

01:25:33.654 --> 01:25:35.823
It is wrong. It is misinformation.

01:25:36.032 --> 01:25:37.116
Wait a minute.

01:25:37.325 --> 01:25:40.745
How can you be so sure? We're talking
about the safety of my kid.

01:25:40.995 --> 01:25:43.748
Everyone, please just stay calm.

01:25:43.956 --> 01:25:44.956
Thank you, Mrs. Ford.

01:25:45.166 --> 01:25:49.212
The police at this point aren't
even sure if it's a murder case.

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:51.130
The reason we're meeting...

01:25:51.339 --> 01:25:55.468
is to quash all rumors
that may be floating around out there.

01:25:58.513 --> 01:26:00.306
This is what we do know.

01:26:00.807 --> 01:26:04.685
Benny Chacon ultimately died
of a drug overdose.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:11.317
Technically, it was morphine,
which is what heroin breaks down into.

01:26:11.526 --> 01:26:13.194
That's bullshit!

01:26:13.528 --> 01:26:15.488
Benny was no junkie!

01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:19.450
I know who did it. It ain't
the gangs you gotta be worrying about.

01:26:19.659 --> 01:26:20.659
It's the teachers!

01:26:20.827 --> 01:26:23.496
That's exactly the kind of rumor
we don't need.

01:26:23.704 --> 01:26:24.997
It was Garfield!

01:26:29.168 --> 01:26:30.168
Sit down!

01:26:30.294 --> 01:26:32.380
Say one more word and you're suspended.

01:26:32.922 --> 01:26:35.633
You're a fucking murderer, Garfield!

01:26:36.342 --> 01:26:40.054
Maybe I can't prove it, but
he fucked up Cesar and killed Benny!

01:26:40.263 --> 01:26:41.305
Victor, please.

01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:45.017
It's the truth, ain't it, G? Ask him.

01:26:45.476 --> 01:26:47.645
Touch me and I'll sue your ass!

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:50.982
You're dead, G! You're fucking dead!

01:27:04.078 --> 01:27:05.872
Garfield, wait up, man!

01:27:06.372 --> 01:27:07.623
Come on!

01:27:08.624 --> 01:27:11.252
You're not gonna let that
punk get to you, are you?

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:15.381
He's a tweaker, a speed freak.
Don't let that punk scare you.

01:27:15.548 --> 01:27:17.675
What do you want? How can I help you?

01:27:17.884 --> 01:27:20.344
How about you give me a ride home?

01:27:20.553 --> 01:27:23.890
My old lady wouldn't give me
the car this morning. She's a bitch.

01:27:24.807 --> 01:27:26.350
You smell like beer.

01:27:26.559 --> 01:27:29.103
I only had two. I swear that's all I had.

01:27:29.312 --> 01:27:30.438
Come on, give me a ride.

01:27:30.646 --> 01:27:32.607
I live right over here off Chandler.

01:27:32.815 --> 01:27:34.108
I'll buy you a drink.

01:27:34.317 --> 01:27:35.484
Come on!

01:27:35.693 --> 01:27:36.903
Get in!

01:27:37.111 --> 01:27:38.321
What do you drink?

01:27:38.529 --> 01:27:41.449
Scotch? Bourbon? Beer? Gin?

01:27:41.657 --> 01:27:44.076
Hurry up, will you? I gotta pee.

01:27:45.995 --> 01:27:50.791
I had a similar situation happen to me
about the time of the Night Stalker.

01:27:51.375 --> 01:27:53.377
Whole city was scared shitless.

01:27:53.586 --> 01:27:58.424
My old lady thought that the mailman was
the Stalker for a couple of weeks there.

01:28:00.384 --> 01:28:04.013
But then some mental midget
from my 4th period...

01:28:04.221 --> 01:28:07.975
gets this idea. He starts this rumor
that I'm the Night Stalker.

01:28:08.184 --> 01:28:10.895
I mean, even after
they caught that Ramirez.

01:28:11.103 --> 01:28:15.566
I could still hear this guy saying,
"No, no, you got the wrong guy.

01:28:15.775 --> 01:28:18.027
Childress is the stalker, ese."

01:28:18.235 --> 01:28:19.445
Idiots!

01:28:22.239 --> 01:28:24.283
It's getting late. I better go.

01:28:24.492 --> 01:28:25.951
Thanks for the soda.

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:27.745
Hold your horses, man!

01:28:28.621 --> 01:28:30.456
Can't let you leave...

01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:32.208
without meeting the kids.

01:28:32.416 --> 01:28:34.168
Come on. Come on back.

01:28:42.551 --> 01:28:45.096
What we got here? Well, this gun...

01:28:45.471 --> 01:28:47.306
is from Czechoslovakia.

01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:52.770
This is a CZ.22 automatic 10-round clip.

01:28:53.104 --> 01:28:55.981
Glow-in-the-dark sights.

01:28:58.776 --> 01:29:00.236
Ain't that a beauty?

01:29:01.153 --> 01:29:02.321
All right.

01:29:03.823 --> 01:29:05.658
I got a custom Smitty 9 milli...

01:29:06.158 --> 01:29:07.785
with extended grip.

01:29:07.993 --> 01:29:09.161
Because as you know...

01:29:09.370 --> 01:29:11.038
them Smith & Wesson...

01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:13.165
they kick like a mother!

01:29:17.461 --> 01:29:19.088
Here it is.

01:29:19.422 --> 01:29:21.132
This is a beauty.

01:29:21.924 --> 01:29:24.135
This is a Glock. 21.

01:29:25.845 --> 01:29:27.263
The lightest handgun...

01:29:27.471 --> 01:29:29.014
in the world.

01:29:29.682 --> 01:29:34.520
The barrel, firing pin are made out
of metal, but everything else on this...

01:29:34.687 --> 01:29:36.188
is made out of plastic.

01:29:36.355 --> 01:29:38.149
Go ahead. Feel that.

01:29:39.567 --> 01:29:40.985
Go ahead, take it!

01:29:41.861 --> 01:29:43.320
Because you know...

01:29:43.529 --> 01:29:45.781
you never can be too prepared.

01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:47.950
My pukey little Colt. 380!

01:29:48.159 --> 01:29:49.618
You wear that thing to school?

01:29:50.661 --> 01:29:52.037
Come on, Garfield!

01:29:52.246 --> 01:29:56.292
Jesus Christ! They don't check
teachers with the metal detectors.

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:59.795
I got a. 357 in my desk.
Of course you know that!

01:30:00.087 --> 01:30:01.630
I was paying attention.

01:30:01.881 --> 01:30:04.175
You should've seen the look on your face.

01:30:06.385 --> 01:30:07.845
You know, José...

01:30:08.721 --> 01:30:11.765
I told you!

01:30:11.974 --> 01:30:14.185
Stay in your cotton-picking seat, boy!

01:30:22.776 --> 01:30:26.447
Don't tell me you never wanted to blow
one of these bastards away.

01:30:28.782 --> 01:30:32.995
Speaking of blowing, you ever
wanna fuck a high-school chick?

01:30:33.203 --> 01:30:35.456
Because I caught your girl Rita!

01:30:35.664 --> 01:30:39.835
Caught her in the utility shed
couple of months back busting the train.

01:30:40.044 --> 01:30:42.713
Must've had 5 or 6 cholos
lined up back there.

01:30:43.047 --> 01:30:45.549
Let's face it, brother, the girl's a slut.

01:30:47.635 --> 01:30:48.844
She's a slut!

01:30:52.431 --> 01:30:54.558
Come on, man, I know you did her.

01:30:56.268 --> 01:30:58.687
I know you had her. Even I had her!

01:30:58.896 --> 01:30:59.897
You're drunk.

01:31:00.105 --> 01:31:03.233
So fucking what? I'm drunk.

01:31:03.651 --> 01:31:06.111
I'm kicking it with you, you know.

01:31:06.278 --> 01:31:07.488
I'm sitting here...

01:31:07.696 --> 01:31:10.449
I'm talking to you about
screwing broads...

01:31:12.493 --> 01:31:16.205
and you're sitting here copping
the self-righteous attitude.

01:31:17.998 --> 01:31:19.667
So what gives?

01:31:21.168 --> 01:31:23.087
I mean, did...

01:31:23.295 --> 01:31:25.297
Did you do it, Garfield?

01:31:26.674 --> 01:31:28.342
Did you whack Benny?

01:31:32.805 --> 01:31:34.390
You can tell me.

01:31:34.598 --> 01:31:36.600
I ain't gonna tell anybody.

01:31:37.851 --> 01:31:39.603
What about Cesar?

01:31:40.312 --> 01:31:43.816
I thought it was generous
just taking off his little finger.

01:31:44.024 --> 01:31:45.609
I would've cut off his balls.

01:31:46.485 --> 01:31:48.070
Go to hell, Dave.

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.281
What?

01:31:55.661 --> 01:31:57.162
You did do it.

01:31:58.831 --> 01:32:00.541
Son of a bitch!

01:32:02.167 --> 01:32:05.003
You crazy motherfucker, you did!

01:32:07.256 --> 01:32:10.676
You probably think you and I are alike.

01:32:17.099 --> 01:32:18.642
We're not.

01:32:24.148 --> 01:32:25.149
Good night.

01:32:29.361 --> 01:32:30.487
Good night.

01:32:31.196 --> 01:32:32.196
Peace.

01:32:53.802 --> 01:32:56.096
You're still in school. You're just 15.

01:32:56.305 --> 01:32:57.305
Yeah, I am.

01:32:57.890 --> 01:33:00.017
What kind of a future plan do you have?

01:33:00.225 --> 01:33:02.895
I know I'm gonna have to
tone down my looks.

01:33:03.103 --> 01:33:06.648
There's a lot of jobs where
you can actually wear hats.

01:33:08.275 --> 01:33:10.527
Go ahead, Nicky. Go ahead, just do it.

01:33:11.069 --> 01:33:12.613
Pull it, pull it!

01:33:12.863 --> 01:33:16.950
You got an empty chamber in that gun!
Put an empty chamber in that gun!

01:34:32.025 --> 01:34:34.111
I don't think she's coming today.

01:35:37.883 --> 01:35:39.009
What you doing here?

01:35:39.217 --> 01:35:41.344
I missed you this morning. What happened?

01:35:41.553 --> 01:35:43.763
I came by to make sure you're all right.

01:35:44.389 --> 01:35:45.557
You okay?

01:35:48.852 --> 01:35:51.354
If you don't take finals,
you won't graduate.

01:35:51.563 --> 01:35:53.356
I ain't going back, so forget it.

01:35:53.565 --> 01:35:56.026
I promise you Stevie and Cesar
won't bother you.

01:35:56.234 --> 01:35:58.570
It don't matter.
School's just for other kids.

01:35:58.987 --> 01:36:00.030
Not me.

01:36:00.572 --> 01:36:02.949
Come on, you know you don't mean that.

01:36:03.325 --> 01:36:05.577
You're doing so well.
Don't throw it all away.

01:36:05.785 --> 01:36:07.370
How about that essay?

01:36:07.579 --> 01:36:08.872
How'd you do?

01:36:09.873 --> 01:36:12.125
You still wanna be a writer, don't you?

01:36:17.506 --> 01:36:19.049
Listen, I...

01:36:19.925 --> 01:36:21.176
I know about Childress.

01:36:22.135 --> 01:36:23.135
What?

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:26.223
He'll never touch you again. I promise.

01:36:27.724 --> 01:36:29.309
He's full of shit!

01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:33.063
Get out! I don't need your pity.
I don't need you.

01:36:35.273 --> 01:36:37.317
You made a mistake, that's all.

01:36:59.631 --> 01:37:00.924
You see these?

01:37:02.467 --> 01:37:04.386
Phone calls about you.

01:37:05.929 --> 01:37:07.138
Good ones.

01:37:10.475 --> 01:37:13.228
Cesar's mother told me
how you tried to help him.

01:37:15.355 --> 01:37:17.440
You're evidently a good teacher.

01:37:20.652 --> 01:37:22.028
However...

01:37:22.237 --> 01:37:24.781
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to let you go.

01:37:27.659 --> 01:37:31.287
As much as I'd like to have you stay
until the end of the year...

01:37:31.496 --> 01:37:35.792
I can't overlook the seriousness
of certain accusations.

01:37:37.335 --> 01:37:41.965
Is it true that you had meetings
with a female student at your house?

01:37:45.969 --> 01:37:47.804
I was trying to help her.

01:37:51.349 --> 01:37:53.852
The implications are still there.

01:37:55.061 --> 01:37:57.981
I can't afford to open the door
for another lawsuit.

01:38:01.901 --> 01:38:04.612
I'm sure you can appreciate my position.

01:38:12.287 --> 01:38:14.038
You can stay till Friday.

01:38:17.167 --> 01:38:19.127
I hope that'll be sufficient.

01:38:38.563 --> 01:38:40.565
I don't think you're being an alarmist.

01:38:40.774 --> 01:38:43.401
He gets a little overzealous at times...

01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:45.695
like some other people I know.

01:38:47.405 --> 01:38:49.783
I don't think the rosary
adds up to much either.

01:38:49.991 --> 01:38:50.991
Why?

01:38:51.034 --> 01:38:52.702
It's probably his.

01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:56.664
When I received my First Holy Communion...

01:38:56.873 --> 01:39:00.585
all the boys got black rosaries,
all the girls got white rosaries.

01:39:00.793 --> 01:39:03.755
Trust me, there must be
millions of black rosaries...

01:39:03.963 --> 01:39:07.300
filed away in desk drawers
from here to the Vatican.

01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:13.681
The guy's been through a lot.
The system failed him.

01:39:14.724 --> 01:39:18.436
I don't think any of us can really
appreciate what he's been through.

01:39:21.105 --> 01:39:23.441
I say we give the man a break.

01:41:28.858 --> 01:41:30.526
You dogs ready to do this?

01:41:33.738 --> 01:41:36.699
Once we go in, we don't come out
till that nigga's dead.

01:41:37.950 --> 01:41:38.950
You hear me?

01:41:39.118 --> 01:41:40.328
Got that right.

01:41:40.536 --> 01:41:42.205
Then you down with K.O.S.

01:41:42.413 --> 01:41:44.373
That's what I been waiting for, ese.

01:41:46.584 --> 01:41:47.877
Yeah, I'm down.

01:41:48.294 --> 01:41:49.462
Any of you leave...

01:41:50.213 --> 01:41:52.048
I'll kill you myself.

01:41:54.175 --> 01:41:55.510
You know what to do.

01:41:59.597 --> 01:42:01.808
Where'd you jack this car from, homes?

01:42:02.016 --> 01:42:03.559
Shit's nasty.

01:43:24.473 --> 01:43:26.934
Let's smoke this bitch.

01:44:12.563 --> 01:44:14.148
I'm in here, Cesar.

01:44:14.356 --> 01:44:16.317
Don't you move, Garfield.

01:44:17.234 --> 01:44:19.111
Don't you make a move.

01:44:21.906 --> 01:44:24.617
You killed my homeboy Benny.

01:44:24.867 --> 01:44:26.869
And you cut off my finger.

01:44:27.495 --> 01:44:29.163
Now let me hear you say that.

01:44:31.665 --> 01:44:32.708
Yeah, I did it.

01:44:33.375 --> 01:44:34.502
I told you, man!

01:44:34.710 --> 01:44:35.710
Fucking A!

01:44:37.963 --> 01:44:39.006
Let me do him.

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:40.841
No.

01:44:41.759 --> 01:44:43.552
This nigga's mine.

01:44:52.603 --> 01:44:54.522
You ever seen Deer Hunter?

01:45:04.698 --> 01:45:06.242
Put it to your head...

01:45:07.827 --> 01:45:09.370
pull the trigger.

01:45:10.246 --> 01:45:12.081
You gonna do yourself.

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.769
That macho enough for you?

01:45:35.187 --> 01:45:36.814
That make me a man?

01:45:37.648 --> 01:45:39.358
Take more than that to be me.

01:45:39.775 --> 01:45:40.775
Yeah?

01:45:41.068 --> 01:45:42.444
Then you do it.

01:45:43.612 --> 01:45:45.114
Come on, maricón.

01:45:45.406 --> 01:45:46.406
Do it!

01:45:48.409 --> 01:45:49.409
Vato's scared.

01:45:49.451 --> 01:45:50.869
He's trying to weasel out.

01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:52.454
He's fucking with your head!

01:46:06.719 --> 01:46:08.053
Come on.

01:46:08.929 --> 01:46:10.764
That's not how we playing the game.

01:46:12.558 --> 01:46:15.102
Not man enough to play your own game?

01:46:17.938 --> 01:46:19.064
Where's your cojones?

01:46:19.273 --> 01:46:20.733
Shut up!

01:46:27.281 --> 01:46:29.575
You gonna hide behind your homeboys?

01:46:30.159 --> 01:46:31.744
Where's your pride?

01:46:32.244 --> 01:46:34.913
Come on, I pulled three times.
You ain't pulled once.

01:46:44.548 --> 01:46:46.008
What are you doing, man?

01:46:49.094 --> 01:46:50.804
You disrespecting me?

01:46:51.013 --> 01:46:52.765
You saying I ain't a man?

01:46:53.766 --> 01:46:55.684
I'm saying you're a fool.

01:46:59.104 --> 01:47:00.856
Don't be doing that shit, man!

01:47:03.359 --> 01:47:04.443
You the man, Cesar.

01:47:04.902 --> 01:47:07.905
You the man, and you ain't shit!
You hear me?

01:47:08.113 --> 01:47:10.449
He got character and you ain't got shit!

01:47:10.657 --> 01:47:11.657
What the fuck?

01:47:16.872 --> 01:47:18.791
Yeah, shoot his ass, homey.

01:47:20.501 --> 01:47:21.502
Your turn.

01:47:22.211 --> 01:47:24.505
You got some respect back now?

01:47:24.713 --> 01:47:27.549
The only thing you respect is stupidity.

01:47:30.719 --> 01:47:33.013
You willing to die for stupidity?

01:47:33.722 --> 01:47:37.184
See, I am, if it'll teach you something.

01:47:37.851 --> 01:47:39.520
You can't kill me, homeboy.

01:47:40.771 --> 01:47:45.025
What I am, what I was,
died over a year ago.

01:47:45.234 --> 01:47:49.196
Everything I've ever wanted
has been taken from me.

01:47:49.822 --> 01:47:52.366
And no matter how many of you
I get rid of...

01:47:52.574 --> 01:47:55.202
I can't get it back!

01:47:56.078 --> 01:47:57.871
I was a teacher!

01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:00.165
I wanted to help you!

01:48:00.624 --> 01:48:03.293
You can't kill me!

01:48:04.545 --> 01:48:06.255
And you can't scare me!

01:48:07.673 --> 01:48:08.841
He's crazy, man.

01:48:09.049 --> 01:48:11.301
That's right! Isn't that what you respect?

01:48:11.677 --> 01:48:13.512
Loco! Come on, Cesar!

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:16.932
If you're gonna be stupid,
be all the way stupid!

01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:19.268
Put it to your head, pull the trigger!

01:48:19.476 --> 01:48:20.602
Do it!

01:48:24.565 --> 01:48:25.607
Do it!

01:48:36.493 --> 01:48:37.619
Do it!

01:48:41.582 --> 01:48:44.751
Your whole way of life is bullshit!

01:48:45.043 --> 01:48:48.088
Macho is bullshit!

01:48:48.297 --> 01:48:49.840
It's all I got!

01:48:52.968 --> 01:48:55.053
So now you're the victim?

01:48:55.888 --> 01:48:57.931
Let me take your turn for you.

01:49:03.312 --> 01:49:04.354
Shit!

01:49:05.939 --> 01:49:07.190
He's out!

01:49:10.569 --> 01:49:12.112
He's fucking out!

01:49:13.905 --> 01:49:15.407
He smoked himself!

01:49:15.782 --> 01:49:17.117
Let's go.

01:49:18.368 --> 01:49:20.370
Oh, man! Let's go, homey.

01:49:20.579 --> 01:49:21.913
He took my turn.

01:49:22.122 --> 01:49:23.122
What?

01:49:23.665 --> 01:49:26.043
I could've taken
my own motherfucking turn.

01:49:26.251 --> 01:49:27.794
So fucking what? He's dead.

01:49:28.003 --> 01:49:29.588
Let's go! Come on!

01:49:29.796 --> 01:49:31.089
I've gotta do this.

01:49:31.298 --> 01:49:32.591
Fuck this!

01:49:37.846 --> 01:49:40.265
What are you doing? Let's go!

01:49:40.474 --> 01:49:42.851
I got one in six chances.

01:49:43.685 --> 01:49:45.812
I'm gonna beat this bitch.

01:49:48.523 --> 01:49:49.650
What the f...?

01:50:02.245 --> 01:50:04.081
Why'd you do that, man?

01:50:06.875 --> 01:50:09.002
What's the fucking point?

01:50:26.269 --> 01:50:27.270
Somehow...

01:50:27.479 --> 01:50:30.148
the sight of my own reflection...

01:50:31.817 --> 01:50:33.860
increased my loneliness.

01:51:47.392 --> 01:51:49.603
The title of my essay is...

01:51:49.978 --> 01:51:51.396
"Mi Salida"...

01:51:51.605 --> 01:51:52.772
"My Way Out."

01:51:54.441 --> 01:51:58.111
There's been a lot of talk
the last couple of weeks...

01:51:58.528 --> 01:52:03.325
about whether Mr. Garfield done
what they wrote about in the newspapers.

01:52:06.453 --> 01:52:10.540
He once told me that you can't blame
everything on your environment.

01:52:10.749 --> 01:52:13.793
But I think you can push
a good teacher too far.

01:52:14.419 --> 01:52:16.963
And he'll go bad like anybody else.

01:52:18.214 --> 01:52:21.134
I don't know if Mr. G.
Done all those bad things.

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:25.305
But what I do know is that
teachers don't get no respect.

01:52:26.514 --> 01:52:29.517
I'm up here today because of him.

01:52:30.685 --> 01:52:32.812
He was there for me when nobody else was.

01:52:35.899 --> 01:52:38.693
The thing is,
I should've been there for him too.

01:52:43.156 --> 01:52:45.617
I didn't wanna stand up here today.

01:52:47.077 --> 01:52:49.412
But Mr. G. Asked me...

01:52:51.247 --> 01:52:54.793
if I was afraid it
would be a Pyrrhic victory.

01:52:55.752 --> 01:52:58.463
And I asked him, "What's up with that?"

01:52:59.714 --> 01:53:02.467
He said to go look it up, so I did.

01:53:08.431 --> 01:53:09.933
This is called a city.

01:53:10.141 --> 01:53:12.519
Human beings used to live here.

01:53:12.727 --> 01:53:15.230
It refers to this guy named Pyrrhus.

01:53:15.438 --> 01:53:19.150
He was a king around 300 B.C.

01:53:19.651 --> 01:53:21.986
Pyrrhus defeated the Romans...

01:53:22.195 --> 01:53:24.531
on two separate occasions.

01:53:24.739 --> 01:53:27.575
But those victories cost him
a large part of his army.

01:53:38.837 --> 01:53:40.505
So now...

01:53:48.179 --> 01:53:50.223
whenever somebody says...

01:53:53.685 --> 01:53:56.771
that something is a Pyrrhic victory...

01:53:58.565 --> 01:54:02.527
they mean it's a victory
gained at too great a cost.
