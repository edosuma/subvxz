13:24.720 --> 13:26.680
I spoke to Felim overnight.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.266
Him owning 42 percent
I can live with.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.519
He knows our vision.
We can trust him not to sell

13:31.519 --> 13:32.978
until the timing's right.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.230
We're circling

13:34.230 --> 13:36.941
an eight-billion-dollar
valuation here.

13:36.941 --> 13:40.319
As long as you take care
of this pitch book.

13:40.319 --> 13:44.073
And keep page 27 away from
that crusader Anna Gearing.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.199
Her and her friend

13:45.199 --> 13:47.368
have been a constant pain
in my ass on this.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.786
-
- It's handled.

13:50.621 --> 13:53.374
So, Harper put you up to this?

13:54.333 --> 13:55.668
She a company man?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.670
Think it's her life.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.714
♪ (FAINT MUSIC PLAYING
OVER HEADPHONES) ♪

14:00.798 --> 14:03.217
What does...
what does your Dad do?

14:03.217 --> 14:05.469
He's the Ghanaian Ambassador
to Angola.

14:08.013 --> 14:09.974
You're fucking serious
right now.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.394
My dad was a Post Office clerk.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.479
I imagine unlike your dad,

14:15.563 --> 14:18.566
like, my dad did not expect
much of me.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.319
Which college
has Leo applied to?

14:22.403 --> 14:24.822
Uh, he's doing
an open application.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.074
Okay. First error.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.742
What's he going to read?

14:28.826 --> 14:31.954
Uh. Books, I hope?

14:34.415 --> 14:37.751
He needs to write
his personal statement,

14:37.835 --> 14:38.961
that essay,

14:38.961 --> 14:41.797
and it needs to be done
before we return to London.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.134
You spent much time in Wales?

14:45.134 --> 14:47.886
I hear they have a healthy
contempt for the English.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.390
And who do you think
is hornier for cash,

14:51.390 --> 14:53.809
Tony Blair or Prince Andrew?

14:53.809 --> 14:55.853
Do you consider
yourself a Christian then?

14:55.853 --> 14:58.439
I'm not sure
I would go that far yet, but...

14:58.439 --> 15:01.275
you know, one of the things
you'd have to get onboard with

15:01.275 --> 15:03.944
is that grief is actually
a concession to a higher power.

15:04.028 --> 15:07.323
...actually studied
theology at Oxford, at Regents.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.616
No way.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.244
It's Yasmin, from Pierpoint.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.205
Yasmin!
Great to hear your voice.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.957
<i>Sorry for the noise.
We're refueling.</i>

15:17.041 --> 15:18.626
<i>Was just seeing Antoine

15:18.626 --> 15:20.461

16:36.745 --> 16:41.917

16:41.917 --> 16:45.754
Jackie, are you free to talk
to a client about cryptos?

16:45.838 --> 16:47.131
I don't have time to swot up.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.674
Hedge funds or real money?

16:48.674 --> 16:50.175
Private individual. Italian.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.928
Oh, man, I don't cozy up to
Euro types for no margin.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.263
I like to rip ‘em off, Yas.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.348
The H on their belts
stands for "hoodwinked."

16:56.432 --> 16:58.600
I spent a lot of lockdown
punting cryptos.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.893
Cryptos reek of virginity

16:59.977 --> 17:01.687
and building your own bomb,
but Ken's more fluent

17:01.687 --> 17:02.730
than he cares to admit.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.691
I'm happy to clue them up.
Phone, person.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.777
It's a dinner, tonight.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.572
Well, if you want me, I'm here.

17:11.572 --> 17:14.324
Best self. Need to be
better at managing juniors.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.705
Okay.

17:20.831 --> 17:22.291
Okay. Thank you.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.252
So, Venetia, actually...

17:25.252 --> 17:26.712
Okay.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.173
What the fuck
are you doing
on a foreign exchange system?

17:43.312 --> 17:45.189
GUEST 1: Hello. Thank you.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.612
-
- WAITER 2: Oh, my God!

17:51.612 --> 17:56.992
-

18:06.960 --> 18:07.961
Coming.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.845
Yo.
- Hello.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.681
You have a minute?
- Yeah, I do. Come in.

18:20.891 --> 18:22.893
- They call it a "snug."
-

18:22.893 --> 18:25.145
- Ugly word for an ugly room.
-

18:25.229 --> 18:26.688
Of course
Pierpoint put you in here.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.733
I made them give your friend Gus
the Queen Elizabeth Suite,

18:29.817 --> 18:31.902
just to fuck with them.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.446
Do you know that Pierpoint
is intending to ambush you?

18:35.656 --> 18:38.158
It's cute when young people use
these militaristic terms

18:38.242 --> 18:40.160
to describe something
so run-of-the-mill.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.579
At least now I can sell to Felim
for a premium.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.873
Always game for making
a quick buck off a competitor,

18:44.957 --> 18:46.917
- it's the part that thrills me.
- Mmm.

18:46.917 --> 18:50.170
I guess showing face could mean
you have a vested interest.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.713
Jacks up the price
of your stake.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.549
It would probably
make life a lot easier

18:53.549 --> 18:55.634
if I just sold to Felim, right?

18:55.634 --> 18:59.054
Or maybe I want to watch them
scramble around me first?

18:59.054 --> 19:02.182
Courtiers around a King.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.727
From what I know about Felim,

19:05.811 --> 19:08.438
he's a walking
fucking affectation.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.650
But I know he's
the great pretender.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.695
He was born in state housing
in Glasgow,

19:14.695 --> 19:16.238
and he acts like Richard Rich.

19:20.117 --> 19:24.371
Deep in the fun of '08,
GS marked down my collateral,

19:24.371 --> 19:26.540
triggered major margin calls.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.126
I needed NAV waivers
to buy time,

19:29.126 --> 19:32.337
but my salesperson,
Amy, sweet kid,

19:33.338 --> 19:36.258
overeducated,
bit neo-conny, but sweet,

19:36.258 --> 19:39.469
made it very clear that
her voice was Goldman's.

19:39.553 --> 19:43.765
So, my custom...
Well, how could I keep...

19:43.849 --> 19:47.769
talking to Amy
after she broke our covenant?

19:47.853 --> 19:50.230
She acted like she could
live without me.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.024
Her life was contingent on me.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.286
Do you think
I should sell to Felim?

20:06.413 --> 20:07.664
Pierpoint want you to.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.209
Sell-side playbook.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.503
You realize that's your boss

20:13.587 --> 20:15.255
trying to "seniorize"
that relationship

20:15.339 --> 20:17.299
by telling you what to do?

20:17.299 --> 20:18.884
I don't care
what your employer thinks,

20:18.884 --> 20:20.594
I don't care
what your boss thinks.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.803
The lie of the sell-side

20:21.887 --> 20:24.306
is that your colleagues
aren't your competitors.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.853
What do you think I should do?

20:32.064 --> 20:33.023
I'm not sure I even know

20:33.023 --> 20:34.691
what the pieces on the board
look like.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.863
Well, then how do you expect us
to play the game?

20:41.782 --> 20:45.327
I'm not sure Rican
are being totally transparent.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.497
Fine.

20:48.497 --> 20:52.668
I'll ask again after we murder
some sentient creatures.

20:52.668 --> 20:56.296
Generally, when I ask
a question like that,

20:56.380 --> 20:58.173
I expect an answer
that's more interesting

20:58.173 --> 20:59.883
than the one you just gave.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.259
You are your view.

21:02.344 --> 21:05.430
-

21:09.393 --> 21:11.603
They have Au Bon Climat here.
I swear by it.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.647


21:24.116 --> 21:25.909
Let's speak English.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.786
-

21:27.786 --> 21:29.830
Um... for me,
some sparkling water.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.499
- But you indulge.
Great.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.419
-

21:35.419 --> 21:37.045
So, Kenny...

21:37.129 --> 21:40.173
Uh, do you want to clue Rocco up
on the crypto space?

21:40.257 --> 21:42.426
Rocco, Kenny is our guy on this.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.887
I was skeptical about them
as a genuine asset class but--

21:45.971 --> 21:47.389
Well...

21:47.389 --> 21:49.516
Blockchain's like the future.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.520
Right, Kenny?

21:56.273 --> 21:57.441
What does your tattoo mean?

22:02.279 --> 22:03.280
Um...

22:04.448 --> 22:06.283
It... it's fairly trite.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.369
Essentially means "Carpe Diem."

22:11.872 --> 22:13.749
This might sound
a bit strange but...

22:15.167 --> 22:16.293
you a friend of Billy's?

22:20.589 --> 22:22.674
- Yes!
- I knew it.

22:22.758 --> 22:23.800
I'm eight years. Are you--

22:23.884 --> 22:25.093
Oh, just coming up
on four months...

22:25.177 --> 22:26.845
Congratulations.
- ...but one day at a time.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.305
Thank you, man.
-

22:28.305 --> 22:30.265
Yeah. It's "carpe diem"
to civilians, but...

22:30.265 --> 22:32.517
- if you know, you know, right?
-

22:32.601 --> 22:34.102
"Civilians." I like that.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.437
Yeah.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.814
So, listen,
as someone who made a killing

22:37.898 --> 22:40.692
on DogeLite and Ethereum,

22:40.776 --> 22:42.736
the best financial advice
I can give you is

22:42.736 --> 22:44.071
throw a dart at the board.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.198
-

22:46.198 --> 22:47.365
Nobody knows anything!

22:49.076 --> 22:52.412
So a friend of mine has
just purchased this "Bored Ape."

22:52.496 --> 22:54.206
Should I be adding
this little chimp to my purse?

22:54.206 --> 22:56.500
I'd stick with an actual
yacht club if I were you.

22:58.627 --> 23:02.506
The concept of a buffet
is absolutely abhorrent to me.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.216
I stopped eating breakfast
in my twenties.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.967
I will say that
the tipping culture

23:06.051 --> 23:10.055
at these corporate shoots
gets a little out of hand.

23:10.055 --> 23:13.391
Strikes me as vulgar to carry
that much cash in your breeks.

23:13.475 --> 23:14.518
Morning, Harper.

23:14.518 --> 23:15.894
- Good morning.
Good morning.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.813
What a fucking scruff...

23:17.813 --> 23:21.399
Fieldcraft is
so important, Eric. You never...

23:21.483 --> 23:23.276
Morning, everyone!

23:23.360 --> 23:27.030
Morning. On behalf of Pierpoint,

23:27.114 --> 23:30.575
I am delighted to welcome
Rican Healthcare,

23:30.659 --> 23:32.786
and a number
of its key investors.

23:32.786 --> 23:36.164
Without much further ado,
toast, tea.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.958
Now, McKelvey!

23:41.545 --> 23:44.172
Thank you, Lucinda,
and our newest investors.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.507
Don't look at me.

23:46.466 --> 23:48.260
I'm just hypothetical
in all this.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.471
Well, brevity may or may not be
the soul of wit,

23:51.555 --> 23:53.223
but I think it'd be irresponsible

23:53.223 --> 23:54.766
to give you all firearms

23:54.850 --> 23:57.185
- on the back of some soporific corporate dirge.
-

23:57.269 --> 24:01.148
So,
the tele-medicine revolution
continues apace.

24:01.148 --> 24:03.733
Virtual 24/7
doctors' appointments,

24:03.817 --> 24:05.485
remote prescription services,

24:05.569 --> 24:09.197
and Rican Healthcare
remains at the hard edge.

24:09.281 --> 24:12.701
Now, here in the UK,
we're proposing a substantial

24:12.701 --> 24:14.786
public-private initiative,

24:14.870 --> 24:17.998
whereby we partner with the NHS
to deliver Rican

24:17.998 --> 24:19.791
to patients across the country.

24:19.875 --> 24:23.420
Good to have you with us,
Madam Member of Parliament.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.880
Increasing access,

24:24.880 --> 24:27.549
reducing costs,
improving patient care,

24:27.549 --> 24:31.386
pending regulatory approval.
But you know the spiel by now.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.471
Let's not take time away
from the festivities.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.765
- ♪ ♪
- Anna Gearing. FutureDawn.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.809
James, if I may,
I'd like to ask,

24:37.893 --> 24:41.396
how do you plan
on lowering the US price point

24:41.396 --> 24:42.439
for consumers?

24:42.439 --> 24:45.192
Our interest and stake
from a ESG perspective

24:45.192 --> 24:47.444
was contingent on
broadening access,

24:47.444 --> 24:49.112
so we could service
lower-income households.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.990
We're looking to be as inclusive
as we possibly can.

24:51.990 --> 24:56.036
I mean, uh, accessibility
was a founding tenet for us.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.914
- "A doctor in your pocket."
- Harper Stern. Pierpoint.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.625
An impromptu Q&A session.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.251
So, can you confirm

25:03.335 --> 25:05.128
that the plan is to lower
the US price point?

25:05.212 --> 25:07.589
I was told
that would happen in six months,

25:08.006 --> 25:09.507
then eight.

25:09.591 --> 25:10.759
Base case keeps moving.

25:10.759 --> 25:13.637
We're still working up
the analysis on the timings.

25:13.637 --> 25:16.431
That's what it is,
but you well know

25:16.431 --> 25:17.891
the only reason we exist

25:17.891 --> 25:22.604
is to democratize healthcare,
locally and globally.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.022
And there's still
no visibility

25:24.022 --> 25:26.233
on how you plan to fund
that lower price point?

25:26.233 --> 25:28.485
I'm sure once we've
worked the analysis,

it will tell us.

25:30.445 --> 25:32.864
Okay, let's go
see about them birds,

25:32.948 --> 25:34.699
before they start to unionize.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.331
Thanks for that dinner.

25:41.331 --> 25:44.376
Your pal invited me
to one of those posh AA meetings

25:44.376 --> 25:45.835
off the Old Brompton Road.

25:45.919 --> 25:50.131
<i>Incredible</i> networking,
lucky I had my card.

25:50.215 --> 25:54.302
Venetia, we call that kind of
intro by Yas, "value add."

25:54.386 --> 25:56.221
- You should write that down.
- Glad to be of service.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.056
Do you mind if I get Ven
to follow up?

25:59.140 --> 26:01.226
Oh, shit. I already did.

26:01.226 --> 26:05.522
Oh, fuck off! Don't talk
to me about Elon Musk.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.780
♪ (SPACEY SYNTHESIZER
MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

26:14.698 --> 26:16.032
Precious metals ETFs

26:16.116 --> 26:18.326
are a popular way
to invest in these metals.

26:19.911 --> 26:22.956
Either through physical
or futures-based exposure.

26:23.748 --> 26:25.250
Super. <i>Tschuss!</i>

Celeste, hi. Um...

26:33.550 --> 26:35.135
I...

26:35.135 --> 26:39.597
I just really wanted to
apologize for yesterday.

26:39.681 --> 26:42.767
My father can be...

26:42.851 --> 26:45.603
- a bit of a child.
- No need to apologize.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.108
Well, I thought, um,

26:50.984 --> 26:53.278
I should be,
you know, proactive.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.488
So...

26:55.572 --> 26:59.993
I had an excellent dinner
with Rocco.

26:59.993 --> 27:04.331
I introduced him to
one of our crypto guys in FX.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.834
They really hit it off. So...

27:07.834 --> 27:11.338
Yeah, I think it could be
super generative for us.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.507
Generative, for whom?

27:15.550 --> 27:19.262
Foreign Exchange
Hedge Fund Sales?

27:19.346 --> 27:23.224
Well, you know, we're always
talking about "One Pierpoint,"

27:23.308 --> 27:26.895
breaking down silos,
cross-pollinating clients.

27:26.895 --> 27:30.857
Yes, well, that may be
in your graduate literature.

27:30.857 --> 27:34.235
You just gave him a person
to speak to in this firm

27:34.319 --> 27:35.362
that is not me.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.114
I don't like to share my guys,

27:38.198 --> 27:43.370
profit-share, mind-share,
whatever. My list is my list.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.288
I'm so sorry.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.375
That was not my intention
at all.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.377
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't.

27:50.377 --> 27:55.882
It's just not
what I had in mind for you.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.887
- Jesse, Eric Tao.
- Yeah.

28:00.887 --> 28:03.431
Oh, I'm surprised
we've never crossed.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.058
Well, why's that a surprise?

28:05.058 --> 28:06.434
Felim, good to see you.

28:06.518 --> 28:07.769
- And you.
- Yeah.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.438
You know, my memory always seems
to relegate you to average.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.066
I remain shocked
by your in-person handsomeness.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.901
- Very good.

28:14.901 --> 28:17.654
Well, the indices
are all up this month.

28:17.654 --> 28:18.863
That's all you track, right?

28:18.947 --> 28:20.782
You must be making out
like a bandit.

28:20.782 --> 28:23.743
Or maybe missing out
on the Rican block at a discount

28:23.827 --> 28:24.869
has prohibited your fund

28:24.953 --> 28:27.247
from keeping in rude health
this month.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.957
Let's not get caught up
in the low...

28:28.957 --> 28:31.543
skullduggery of our profession,
shall we, Jesse?

28:31.543 --> 28:33.294
I'm not ashamed
of our profession.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.671
We're with the angels.

28:35.922 --> 28:39.092
- No need to dress it up.
- Or dress up even?

28:39.092 --> 28:41.136
Maybe a wee bit more respect
for our hosts?

28:41.136 --> 28:43.596
-
- Oh, I'm dressed up, buddy.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.391
I won't let your cold-weather
breeding convince you otherwise.

28:46.724 --> 28:48.017
Ooh!

28:48.101 --> 28:49.811
Whereabouts was I bred?

28:49.811 --> 28:52.439
You pass to my eye,
very aristocratic.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.816
Imagine thinking
it was a good thing

28:54.816 --> 28:56.443
for a man to live a life
and never change.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.528
Would you mind, uh,
gathering round, please?

28:58.528 --> 28:59.737

Would you gather
round, please? Thank you.

29:01.448 --> 29:04.409
Come on in, I don't bite.
That's extra.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.119
I'm just trying
to see all the angles,

29:06.119 --> 29:07.454
so I know how to pitch Bloom.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.331
Sing him a fucking song.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.209
Win-win.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.378
Well, I hope you've
all enjoyed your bacon butties,

29:15.462 --> 29:18.882
and soaked up, uh, whatever
you drank in the bar last night.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.050
Uh, now, we've got
a 300-bird day for you,

29:21.134 --> 29:23.970
and we'll be taking in
three drives in total.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.847
For those of you
who haven't shot before,

29:25.847 --> 29:26.848
just come to see me,

29:26.848 --> 29:28.766
and we'll get you sorted,
all right?

29:28.850 --> 29:32.103
Oh, and by the way.
This morning you may see

29:32.187 --> 29:34.856
a rare white pheasant.

29:34.856 --> 29:37.192
Now, they enjoy
diplomatic immunity.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.027
Do not shoot.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.570
Five hundred pound fine.

29:40.570 --> 29:41.946

29:42.030 --> 29:45.658

uh, good to go, follow me.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.205
You just seem to go
from one to another.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.664
Just because
the business is fickle,

29:51.748 --> 29:53.458
it doesn't mean
that you have to be.

29:57.629 --> 30:02.217

an interesting name.

people think he's a philistine.

he is a big Mel Brooks fan.

30:19.776 --> 30:23.738
He... he seems invested
in your academic prospects.

throwing money at it.

Oh, I could murder

You made that look easy.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.069
Not just Peg Totty.

32:26.069 --> 32:28.154
- I shot skeet in Beijing '08.
Huh.

32:28.154 --> 32:30.406
Unsurprisingly,
nobody bothers to ask.

32:30.490 --> 32:31.991
Right.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.202
- Thank you again for the coffee.
- Yeah. Of course.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.620
If I'd known it was you,

32:35.620 --> 32:36.996
I might have stretched
to a cookie.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.124
Well, we are
a Social Impact Fund.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.959
So, it's purportedly harder
to buy us.

32:42.043 --> 32:44.962
- Not impossible, just thornier.
- Hmm.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.840
I didn't know
that a price point cut

32:47.924 --> 32:49.717
was on the cards
for a wider rollout.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.762
Was. Was.

32:52.762 --> 32:56.349
The Rican board don't realize
I can hear them patronizing me

32:56.349 --> 32:58.309
through the corporate verbiage.

32:58.393 --> 33:02.021
We own 18 percent equity.
I'm just a small voice to them.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.817
I need to deliver a price cut,
or my investors will wonder

33:05.817 --> 33:09.195
whether Rican actually qualifies
as a moral investment.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.363
Hmm.

33:10.363 --> 33:13.032
I saw you making
a beeline for McKelvey's car.

33:13.116 --> 33:15.535

- Eagle-eyed.

33:15.535 --> 33:16.703
-
Um...

33:16.703 --> 33:21.249
No, it was actually
Felim I was after.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.252
When he takes Bloom's stake,
I'm gonna chew his ear clean off

33:24.252 --> 33:25.795
about lowering that price point.

33:25.795 --> 33:28.798
- What's his position?
- I'd love to know.

33:28.798 --> 33:32.969
Harper, um, this is Aurore,
a risen star in the Tory party.

33:32.969 --> 33:34.554
Very safe seat.

33:34.554 --> 33:37.098
I actually did six years
in DCM at Pierpoint.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.224
- Oh.
- Healthcare.

33:38.224 --> 33:39.851
And now an interest
in government.

33:39.851 --> 33:40.935
Aurore's just been nominated

33:40.935 --> 33:44.480
for Health and Social Care
Select Committee.

33:44.564 --> 33:47.942
Rican partnering with the NHS
is an exciting idea.

33:47.942 --> 33:49.986
Is there a timeline
on regulatory approval?

33:49.986 --> 33:52.071
I'm not across
those conversations yet.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.614
Though I do agree,

33:53.698 --> 33:56.242
it's a potentially
exciting idea,

33:56.242 --> 33:58.536
if Rican can deliver
on their promise

33:58.536 --> 34:01.956
to increase access
and reduce costs in the US.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.668
Private healthcare...

34:05.752 --> 34:07.545
...it's a very emotional
subject here.

34:07.545 --> 34:10.381
I imagine without a narrative
that speaks to universality,

34:10.465 --> 34:12.508
it's a bit of a non-starter.

34:21.851 --> 34:24.729
- Sloe gin or Bull Shot?
- She'll take a punt on the Bull.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.650
- My pleasure. No problem.
- Thank you.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.277
GUEST 2: I'm not really
into blood sports,

34:31.277 --> 34:34.030
but thankfully pheasant
is sustainable...

34:35.782 --> 34:38.493
Jesse, try and imagine there's
a hoop on the end of the gun

34:38.493 --> 34:39.744
rather than just a bead.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.914
So, you can keep the tail
of the bird inside the hoop,

34:42.914 --> 34:45.875
and that way you can track
the line more consistently.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.043
Hmm.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.628
Isn't it ungentlemanly

34:48.628 --> 34:50.421
to comment on
someone's shooting?

34:50.505 --> 34:52.215
- How many did you get?
I shot straight.

34:52.215 --> 34:54.926
You're not supposed
to ask, "how many."

34:55.968 --> 34:57.386
How the fuck is she
supposed to know

34:57.470 --> 35:00.306
all the arcane feudal laws
that govern this bullshit?

35:00.306 --> 35:03.226
Is there a handbook they give
certain men at birth or...

35:03.226 --> 35:04.393
Harper.

35:05.603 --> 35:07.271

35:29.836 --> 35:33.256
Yeah. Maybe.
Harper, can I grab you quickly?

operating in the dark here?

36:57.632 --> 36:59.508

37:11.938 --> 37:13.189

is very memorable.

37:13.189 --> 37:14.774
I noticed your picture,

37:14.774 --> 37:16.776
was it in this morning's,
uh, deck.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.779
Yeah, a variant of that.

37:19.779 --> 37:22.907

I've become desensitized to it.

37:22.907 --> 37:25.284

over at Pierpoint

37:25.368 --> 37:27.787

in much glory today,

37:27.787 --> 37:30.206
especially with all the hoopla
surrounding the pitch book.

37:30.873 --> 37:32.583

37:34.919 --> 37:36.045

37:36.837 --> 37:37.880
Did Eric not tell you?

37:39.674 --> 37:42.093
Rican commissioned analysis

37:42.093 --> 37:43.803
on how to fund
the tele-med expansion

37:43.803 --> 37:46.764
to low-income households
in the US.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.224
McKelvey said
it hadn't been done.

37:48.224 --> 37:52.436
No, he, um, elided the truth
to the other investors.

37:53.062 --> 37:54.355
The analysis showed,

37:54.355 --> 37:58.317
the only way to, uh, lower
the consumer price point

37:58.985 --> 38:00.695
was to cut the dividend.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.780
Which, of course,
hurts the share price,

38:02.780 --> 38:05.408
kills the value
in the short term, and...

38:05.408 --> 38:06.909
frankly, makes it
far less likely

38:06.993 --> 38:08.286
to make me want to buy in.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.497
- So, they suppressed it?
- Mm-hmm.

38:11.497 --> 38:14.583

I am really sorry, again,

38:24.010 --> 38:26.721
Well, let's concentrate
on the bigger picture.

38:26.721 --> 38:30.599
Because today, for some reason,
the universe has sent down

38:30.683 --> 38:34.478
a wee fucking goblin,
to misuse a firearm in my face.

38:36.188 --> 38:39.567
So when he now sells to me,
which he fucking will...

38:41.986 --> 38:43.404
I'll look back on this...

38:44.280 --> 38:46.949
as the afternoon
that I almost died.

why can't I have that?

39:45.549 --> 39:46.592
Is she good?

to maintain the dividend,
increase buybacks and...

50:51.757 --> 50:53.550
most likely sell quickly.

50:55.385 --> 50:57.345
Reading between the lines, I...

50:58.263 --> 51:00.682
think that it's
an acquisition target.

51:00.766 --> 51:03.268
Again, strictly
reading between the lines...

51:03.268 --> 51:06.646
I think they've already engaged
Pierpoint IBD to find buyers.

51:07.981 --> 51:10.108
Okay. So what,
we sit on the block,

51:10.192 --> 51:11.818
let it rip and take profit?

51:13.528 --> 51:15.530
No. That's Felim's play.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.450
It's why he wants
to buy from you.

51:18.450 --> 51:20.243
It's why the board want him.

51:20.327 --> 51:22.120
And it's why my boss
kept me in the dark.

51:24.331 --> 51:25.624
But I have a better idea.

51:27.834 --> 51:32.422
Without the low-income
expansion now,

51:32.506 --> 51:35.550
Rican Healthcare will not get
regulatory approval in the UK.

51:36.927 --> 51:38.595
How the fuck do you know that?

51:39.888 --> 51:41.932
I don't. It's an educated guess

51:41.932 --> 51:45.894
after speaking with a member
of Her Majesty's government.

51:47.854 --> 51:49.231
So, what's the play?

51:50.023 --> 51:51.983
Don't sell. To Felim or anyone.

51:53.151 --> 51:54.152
Buy.

51:54.986 --> 51:56.446
Take FutureDawn's shares.

51:59.533 --> 52:01.743
I have no interest
in a controlling stake.

52:02.869 --> 52:04.329
And I'm already long
over three billion.

52:04.329 --> 52:06.122
I'm not even sure
I'm a bull on this space.

52:06.206 --> 52:07.374
Hear me out.

52:07.374 --> 52:10.377
You only need nine percent
to give you a controlling stake.

52:10.377 --> 52:12.838
Anna will sell you
half of her equity

52:12.838 --> 52:14.714
if you let her choose the board.

52:14.798 --> 52:16.383
Cut the divvy. Fund expansion.

52:16.383 --> 52:18.927
The price will drop
in the short term, but...

52:20.637 --> 52:22.264
there is potential
for this company

52:22.264 --> 52:25.308
to be a market leader
in a genuine growth area.

52:25.392 --> 52:27.310
How many companies
can you say that about?

52:27.394 --> 52:34.526
It's a gamble, but if I'm right,
it's one hell of a long.

52:37.821 --> 52:38.947
You know, it was inevitable

52:38.947 --> 52:41.074
that Eric tried to poach me
on this trip.

52:43.285 --> 52:45.829
Is that what you'd call that?
Hobbesian?

52:48.039 --> 52:49.165
Check me out!

52:54.087 --> 52:55.422
Did you entertain that?

53:01.428 --> 53:02.470
You got a pen?

53:05.348 --> 53:07.058
I need to underline something.

53:08.685 --> 53:10.562
This Hobbes
is worth remembering.

53:20.155 --> 53:21.197
Looks like a gift.

53:21.948 --> 53:22.949
A memento.

53:24.826 --> 53:26.369
Memento mori.

53:35.712 --> 53:38.006
-

53:41.134 --> 53:42.969
Eric, where is
the wee prick?

53:44.137 --> 53:45.889
Let's just get this done,
shall we?

53:46.806 --> 53:49.100
Yeah. Uh, one second.

53:53.188 --> 53:55.607
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

53:55.607 --> 53:58.276
Harpsichord, it's me.
Everyone's down here.

53:59.945 --> 54:00.987
Uh...

54:02.614 --> 54:03.907
we're nearly through this.

54:05.408 --> 54:06.534
See you soon.

54:22.425 --> 54:24.636
Rishi, I need you to
cross a block for me.

54:24.636 --> 54:25.845
Pre-open. 16 million.

54:25.929 --> 54:27.389
Harper, I'm hanging out my arse.

54:27.389 --> 54:29.391
I've not even moisturized,
and pulled the top off it--

54:29.391 --> 54:30.976
I need this to happen
pre-the open.

54:30.976 --> 54:33.436
Bloom is gonna buy half
of FutureDawn's stake in Rican.

54:33.520 --> 54:35.021
Why would he do that?
What's the angle?

54:35.105 --> 54:37.899
Since when do you need context?
Execute the trade.

54:37.983 --> 54:39.526
- Has Eric signed off on this?
- Sign off?

54:39.526 --> 54:40.568
What fucking "sign off"?

54:40.652 --> 54:42.153
You can't pre-arrange
a block sale.

54:42.237 --> 54:43.446
I need the buyer and the seller.

54:43.530 --> 54:45.490
I have that. I spoke to Harry
on Anna Gearing's desk

54:45.490 --> 54:47.701
this morning at FutureDawn.
I have the order from Bloom.

54:47.701 --> 54:50.161
He and Anna Gearing
have already agreed on a price.

54:50.245 --> 54:52.288
She sells at 48,
he pays a quarter.

54:52.372 --> 54:55.000
All right. Well, then get me
a fucking seller!

54:55.000 --> 54:57.043
All trades go through
the execution desk, Rishi.

54:57.127 --> 55:00.171
I have the order.
We don't say no to biz in hand.

55:01.548 --> 55:03.550
One minute before European open.

55:06.428 --> 55:09.723
Morning, James.
How are your eggs?

55:09.723 --> 55:12.726
Getting cold.
Where is everybody?

55:12.726 --> 55:16.271
It appears that, uh,
Jesse Bloom, of all people,

55:16.271 --> 55:18.440
cares more about
the future of this company

55:18.440 --> 55:19.733
than its custodians.

55:19.733 --> 55:24.029
At market open, I'll have sold
half my equity to Jesse.

55:24.029 --> 55:26.698
Giving him the controlling
interest of Rican.

55:27.741 --> 55:28.908
Harry, Harper again.

55:28.992 --> 55:30.827
I need an order
that instructs me to sell

55:30.827 --> 55:33.329
sixteen million shares
of Rican Health at 48--

55:33.413 --> 55:35.123
- Where's my seller?
- Harry confirms.

55:35.123 --> 55:38.501
FutureDawn sells at 48.
Bloom buys at 48.25.

55:38.585 --> 55:40.003
If we fuck Felim
twice on a block,

55:40.003 --> 55:41.379
he will never trade
with us again.

55:41.463 --> 55:43.631
I'm doing my job. Do yours.

55:44.632 --> 55:46.092
We answer
to the man who pays.

55:46.801 --> 55:47.969
She has a man who pays.

55:48.762 --> 55:49.763
Execute.

55:50.680 --> 55:51.765
Execute.
