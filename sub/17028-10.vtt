WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:03.562
Max, guess who's getting a divorce.

00:03.562 --> 00:06.399
Please tell me it's us.

00:06.400 --> 00:09.535
Nope, we'll be together
way past when we should be.

00:09.536 --> 00:12.103
Like The Rolling Stones.

00:13.339 --> 00:15.641
It's Jason and Winona Williams.

00:15.642 --> 00:18.544
Wow, I really thought those
two were gonna make it.

00:18.545 --> 00:22.682
We're talking about those two
sisters who play tennis, right?

00:22.683 --> 00:24.283
Never heard of them, but there are a lot

00:24.307 --> 00:26.085
of famous people I've never heard of.

00:26.086 --> 00:28.487
Like that guy who's on TV
sometimes and he's always like,

00:28.488 --> 00:31.157
"Blah, blah, I'm on TV."

00:31.158 --> 00:33.392
Yeah, that's Bill Maher.

00:33.393 --> 00:36.195
Anyway, they're rich,
globe-trotting socialites,

00:36.196 --> 00:38.264
and they want to throw a
party at our dessert bar

00:38.265 --> 00:40.099
to celebrate the collapse
of their marriage.

00:40.100 --> 00:42.334
They celebrate divorce now?

00:42.335 --> 00:45.438
My mom missed out on, like, 12 parties.

00:45.439 --> 00:48.340
They're coming tomorrow to
see the place, so maybe don't

00:48.341 --> 00:50.642
wear your "Team Satan" T-shirt.

00:51.944 --> 00:54.413
Why, 'cause there's a stain on it?

00:54.414 --> 00:57.583
No, this could be a $5,000 job, Max.

00:57.584 --> 01:00.219
I was offered a $5,000 job once.

01:00.220 --> 01:03.189
I said, "No way."

01:03.190 --> 01:06.358
Come to think of it,
that was Bill Maher.

01:19.905 --> 01:20.906
Hey, look,

01:20.907 --> 01:24.008
it's Saddington Bear.

01:25.745 --> 01:27.713
Oof, unlike torrential rain,

01:27.714 --> 01:31.083
this jacket does not repel insults.

01:31.084 --> 01:32.985
I have to go check the drains.

01:32.986 --> 01:34.878
Oh, if you find my love life down there,

01:34.879 --> 01:36.989
bring it back to me.

01:36.990 --> 01:40.078
Han, the hurricane ain't coming, man.

01:40.079 --> 01:43.682
My body always knows when
a disaster is on its way.

01:43.683 --> 01:45.917
It predicted the '97 El Niño

01:45.918 --> 01:49.021
and my third wife, Diane.

01:49.022 --> 01:51.189
That's true, and when
he gets chest pains,

01:51.190 --> 01:52.491
it means it'll be partly cloudy.

01:52.492 --> 01:55.894
No, that's a heart attack.

01:55.895 --> 01:59.031
Shortness of breath means partly cloudy.

01:59.032 --> 02:01.933
Pardon me if I don't
just blindly trust Earl.

02:01.934 --> 02:03.435
He voted for Richard Nixon,

02:03.436 --> 02:05.937
this year.

02:05.938 --> 02:08.673
Man, he's gonna get us out of Vietnam.

02:08.674 --> 02:11.376
Well, I'm not taking any chances.

02:11.377 --> 02:13.111
This may come as a shock to you,

02:13.112 --> 02:15.547
but this diner is all I have!

02:15.548 --> 02:17.382
Not true.

02:17.383 --> 02:19.650
You also have tiny arms and legs.

02:22.287 --> 02:25.724
Oh, look, a Minion.

02:25.725 --> 02:27.691
Hey, everybody!

02:29.628 --> 02:33.965
Look, it's me, my Barbara, and my Manny.

02:33.966 --> 02:35.634
Yeah, Oleg and I

02:35.635 --> 02:38.103
hired him to help with Baby Babs.

02:38.104 --> 02:39.938
You know, in Poland,

02:39.939 --> 02:42.874
a Manny has to have his penis removed.

02:42.875 --> 02:43.875
Yeah.

02:43.876 --> 02:47.079
But here, he gets to keep it!

02:47.080 --> 02:49.748
I'm Max, this is my first
time meeting a Manny.

02:49.749 --> 02:51.950
I mean, a lot of men watched
me when I was a teenager,

02:51.951 --> 02:54.886
but they paid me.

02:54.887 --> 02:56.555
Shane!

02:56.556 --> 02:58.957
I'm not just paying you to stand around.

02:58.958 --> 03:01.625
Well, at least burp one of us.

03:04.429 --> 03:05.897
Isn't that the sweetest?

03:05.898 --> 03:07.766
My wife, my baby,

03:07.767 --> 03:10.936
and the man with a lady's job.

03:10.937 --> 03:13.972
You're not nervous
your Manny is, you know,

03:13.973 --> 03:16.074
extremely good-looking,

03:16.075 --> 03:17.576
and you're, well...

03:17.577 --> 03:19.845
Hung?

03:19.846 --> 03:21.346
He's not good-looking.

03:21.347 --> 03:24.214
His eyebrows don't
even meet in the middle.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.919
Sophie didn't want to
hire a woman because

03:27.920 --> 03:29.488
I walk around naked a lot,

03:29.489 --> 03:31.289
and I'm, well...

03:31.290 --> 03:33.692
The grossest?

03:33.693 --> 03:36.495
A stink machine?

03:36.496 --> 03:38.463
Girls, my wife is here.

03:38.464 --> 03:40.631
Stop flirting with me.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.802
Max, are you gonna go out with Shane?

03:43.803 --> 03:46.271
Because he's staring at you.

03:46.272 --> 03:50.008
Unless he's trying really
hard to read that sign.

03:50.009 --> 03:52.277
Uh, I'm already in a relationship

03:52.278 --> 03:54.112
with Randy, remember him?

03:54.113 --> 03:56.982
'Bout yay tall, yay wide, yay long.

03:56.983 --> 03:59.651
I know how "yay long."
It's your screensaver.

03:59.652 --> 04:02.287
But, uh, didn't you guys break up?

04:05.791 --> 04:09.494
You are so naive, mi amigo.

04:09.495 --> 04:12.831
This is all part of
me and Randy's dance.

04:12.832 --> 04:14.065
I say we should break up,

04:14.066 --> 04:15.734
and he says it's definitely over,

04:15.735 --> 04:19.671
so we're still very much together.

04:19.672 --> 04:21.339
I know I've been out of the game awhile,

04:21.339 --> 04:22.641
but that makes less sense

04:22.642 --> 04:25.477
than dress Crocs.

04:25.478 --> 04:27.261
I didn't ask your opinion
when I bought them,

04:27.262 --> 04:29.347
and I'm not asking for it now.

04:29.348 --> 04:30.691
And this is the part of the dance

04:30.692 --> 04:32.551
where he shows up and surprises me.

04:32.552 --> 04:34.519
Damn it, I should have worn my Crocs.

04:35.655 --> 04:37.189
Awful news!

04:37.190 --> 04:39.658
I was unable to fix the drains!

04:39.659 --> 04:41.026
Turns out,

04:41.027 --> 04:44.095
we don't have any!

04:44.096 --> 04:45.564
We need to protect ourselves.

04:45.565 --> 04:47.566
I'll be outside, filling sandbags.

04:47.567 --> 04:50.000
Anyone who wants to help, follow me.

04:52.671 --> 04:55.574
No one's behind me, are they?

04:55.575 --> 04:59.076
Nope, just the shadow of
a child holding a lantern.

05:00.712 --> 05:01.947
Oh, you know what, Shane?

05:01.948 --> 05:04.249
I'm bored.

05:04.250 --> 05:06.284
Now, come on, let's go
back to the apartment.

05:06.285 --> 05:09.187
And you can walk on my
back while Barbara naps.

05:09.188 --> 05:12.357
You know, like mannies do.

05:12.358 --> 05:13.892
Bye.

05:13.893 --> 05:16.027
Let's go!

05:19.799 --> 05:21.866
Where are Jason and Winona?

05:21.867 --> 05:23.570
They need to get here
before the storm does

05:23.571 --> 05:25.270
and my hair frizzes.

05:25.271 --> 05:28.039
Well, Randy better get
here before the storm too.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.743
Ooh, this could be him!

05:29.744 --> 05:31.076
Damn it.

05:31.077 --> 05:34.145
The one time I don't
want a text from Chili's.

05:34.146 --> 05:35.746
Although they're practically giving away

05:35.770 --> 05:38.657
these sizzling fajitas.

05:39.785 --> 05:41.152
Jason and Winona! You made it.

05:41.153 --> 05:42.921
I was worried something
horrible happened,

05:42.922 --> 05:44.222
like you got caught in the storm

05:44.223 --> 05:46.758
or you got back together!

05:49.829 --> 05:51.663
I think it has to be below zero

05:51.664 --> 05:53.498
for hell to freeze over.

05:53.499 --> 05:56.134
And we should know.
We've been to the Arctic.

05:56.135 --> 05:58.503
He murdered a penguin.

05:58.504 --> 06:01.573
It was an accident!

06:01.574 --> 06:03.642
If it was the penguin from Happy Feet,

06:03.643 --> 06:05.977
you'll pay for that with
your life, my friend.

06:05.978 --> 06:07.445
That's Max.

06:07.446 --> 06:09.314
She thinks cartoon characters are real.

06:09.315 --> 06:10.649
I'm Caroline Channing.

06:10.650 --> 06:12.150
And she thinks Matthew McConaughey

06:12.151 --> 06:14.853
actually loves driving a Lincoln.

06:14.854 --> 06:16.955
Why would he endorse that?
He doesn't need the money.

06:16.956 --> 06:18.757
End of story.

06:18.758 --> 06:21.459
Ugh. This place is so cute.

06:21.460 --> 06:22.694
Almost as cute

06:22.695 --> 06:24.796
as the mud hut in
Borneo where I realized

06:24.797 --> 06:26.798
I didn't love you.

06:26.799 --> 06:29.501
That was five years ago.

06:29.502 --> 06:31.670
Okay, maybe save that for the toast?

06:31.671 --> 06:33.838
Here's some of the themed
drinks we're working on.

06:33.839 --> 06:37.275
Almost Single Malt Scotch.

06:37.276 --> 06:39.644
Resent-Mint Chocolate
Chip Cookie Shooters.

06:39.645 --> 06:41.146
Still debating the

06:41.147 --> 06:44.316
"Tequila" Him Would
Have Been Easier shots.

06:46.452 --> 06:48.320
Oh, hate to break this meeting up,

06:48.321 --> 06:50.121
but I think my boyfriend's here.

06:53.158 --> 06:56.461
Yeah, he doesn't like to
bother me when I'm working.

06:56.462 --> 06:59.197
Well, maybe I should get going
before the weather gets too bad.

06:59.198 --> 07:02.133
I have a date I should
have gone on five years ago.

07:02.134 --> 07:04.868
Oh, I bet it's not even raining.

07:11.509 --> 07:14.679
See? Just a little sprinkle.

07:14.680 --> 07:18.183
You wear a bra?

07:18.184 --> 07:21.586
The hurricane is headed
right for Williamsburg.

07:21.587 --> 07:23.688
Fedoras are blowing down the streets.

07:23.689 --> 07:25.824
Craft beers are spilling everywhere.

07:25.825 --> 07:29.361
And indie bands are cancelling practice.

07:29.362 --> 07:31.062
Sorry, girls, I guess Shakira was wrong.

07:31.063 --> 07:32.997
My hips do lie.

07:32.998 --> 07:35.367
This explains why Randy isn't here yet.

07:35.368 --> 07:37.502
He's probably stuck in the storm.

07:37.503 --> 07:39.237
Max, you're being delusional.

07:39.238 --> 07:42.407
And I know that because I'm delusional.

07:42.408 --> 07:44.342
Han, I have to get home.

07:44.343 --> 07:45.777
Sophie's alone with the Manny

07:45.778 --> 07:48.346
and she gets turned on by bad weather.

07:48.347 --> 07:49.781
It's true.

07:49.782 --> 07:51.850
Last time it snowed, we
made out a little bit.

07:51.851 --> 07:55.053
Her favorite porno is The Perfect Storm,

07:55.054 --> 07:59.357
even with Diane Lane's
horrible Boston accent.

07:59.358 --> 08:01.025
Oleg, no, it's too dangerous.

08:01.026 --> 08:03.160
Yeah, it is. Han, go with him.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:16.274 --> 08:19.778
Even the wind pushes Oleg away.

08:26.719 --> 08:28.820
That's my worst experience being blown

08:28.821 --> 08:30.622
since I got caught in the hand dryer

08:30.623 --> 08:32.256
in the ladies' washroom.

08:34.293 --> 08:36.961
Oh, no. Everyone into the walk-in.

08:36.962 --> 08:38.096
Ugh.

08:38.097 --> 08:39.397
Well, I guess we're stuck here.

08:39.398 --> 08:41.166
Another hostage situation.

08:41.167 --> 08:42.433
Just like our honeymoon.

08:42.434 --> 08:43.578
Oh, you loved Tehran.

08:45.404 --> 08:48.239
So do you guys want
to see a sample menu?

08:48.240 --> 08:50.141
Max, light a match so they can see.

08:50.142 --> 08:52.410
Give me a sec. I'm looting the register.

08:52.411 --> 08:53.611
Sorry, it's a reflex.

09:02.671 --> 09:05.606
Should we eat all the
food before it expires?

09:05.607 --> 09:08.042
Two years ago.

09:08.043 --> 09:10.511
This is the safest
place in the building.

09:10.512 --> 09:13.014
This used to be my gift-wrapping suite.

09:13.015 --> 09:15.249
I mean, man cave.

09:15.250 --> 09:18.586
Am I sitting on a sack of potatoes?

09:18.587 --> 09:21.555
Nope. Just my prostate.

09:21.556 --> 09:24.152
So sorry for the inconvenience.

09:24.153 --> 09:26.087
Can I offer you some pinto beans?

09:26.088 --> 09:27.255
A tub of slaw?

09:27.256 --> 09:29.824
Mouse skeleton?

09:29.825 --> 09:32.293
Well, it does remind me of
that time in the rainforest

09:32.294 --> 09:33.961
when we stole that tribe's food

09:33.962 --> 09:35.782
and they hung us up from our genitals.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.465
Oh, yeah.

09:37.466 --> 09:39.167
Oh, you looked so cute that day.

09:39.168 --> 09:42.270
All upside down and screaming.

09:42.271 --> 09:43.371
Stop.

09:43.372 --> 09:45.773
"Upside down and screaming"?

09:45.774 --> 09:47.141
Oh, that's it.

09:47.142 --> 09:48.810
I'm FaceTiming Sophie to make sure

09:48.811 --> 09:51.279
her storm door is sealed shut.

09:53.015 --> 09:54.782
Sophie.

09:54.783 --> 09:58.019
For once I'm grateful you
have all your clothes on.

09:58.020 --> 09:59.353
Although...

09:59.354 --> 10:01.322
stay focused, Oleg.

10:01.323 --> 10:03.224
Hey, Oleg.

10:03.225 --> 10:07.128
Yeah, we're fine, I was just
reading Barbara her horoscope.

10:07.129 --> 10:10.865
Now she's about to find out
who her true friends are.

10:10.866 --> 10:14.302
Yeah, oh, and tell the girls
that we brought Chestnut in.

10:14.303 --> 10:15.802
"We"?

10:20.074 --> 10:22.844
What happened to his shirt?

10:22.845 --> 10:24.011
Chestnut's?

10:24.012 --> 10:26.481
Well, I took it off. He was warm.

10:26.482 --> 10:28.416
No, Sophie, the Manny.

10:28.417 --> 10:30.651
His nipples are staring at me.

10:30.652 --> 10:32.253
Well, what do you think happened to it?

10:32.254 --> 10:35.490
He spilled his wine...
hey, Oleg, I gotta hang up.

10:35.491 --> 10:39.160
We gotta close the windows.
It's a perfect storm out there.

10:39.161 --> 10:41.095
Yeah, I think I am gonna get up there

10:41.096 --> 10:43.998
on that horse bareback with you.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.168
"Perfect storm"?

10:47.169 --> 10:49.270
Oh, no, this is terrible.

10:49.271 --> 10:51.506
There's wine. There's a storm.

10:51.507 --> 10:52.840
There's a horse in the mix.

10:52.841 --> 10:55.343
The sexual possibilities are dizzying!

10:55.344 --> 10:56.377
Wine?

10:56.378 --> 10:58.144
Ooh, that reminds me.

10:59.614 --> 11:01.349
Oh, sorry. We're out of wine.

11:01.350 --> 11:02.917
Who wants a Capri Sun and vodka?

11:02.918 --> 11:04.552
Scratch that.

11:04.553 --> 11:07.188
Who doesn't want a Capri Sun and vodka?

11:07.189 --> 11:10.091
What am I gonna do?

11:10.092 --> 11:14.028
I have travel Scattergories
in my emergency backpack.

11:14.029 --> 11:16.764
Perhaps we roll an F for fun?

11:16.765 --> 11:19.700
Perhaps we roll you outside for fun?

11:19.701 --> 11:24.405
Oof, so much for the community
coming together during a crisis.

11:24.406 --> 11:26.474
Oh, what's the bathroom
policy around here?

11:26.475 --> 11:28.209
Just go anywhere?

11:30.546 --> 11:33.214
Oh, no, no, this is not good.

11:33.215 --> 11:36.449
My diner is more screwed
than Sophie right now.

11:38.820 --> 11:40.288
Too soon?

11:41.390 --> 11:43.558
Hold me!

11:43.559 --> 11:45.226
Just so you know,

11:45.227 --> 11:48.663
that is a flashlight in my pocket.

11:58.519 --> 12:02.289
Are we gonna talk about what happened?

12:02.290 --> 12:03.957
Max, please tell me they make

12:03.958 --> 12:06.960
really, really small flashlights

12:06.961 --> 12:09.194
that move on their own.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.699
Do you want me to lie to you

12:12.700 --> 12:16.568
or do you want me to tell
you that was Han's penis?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.773
Wow.

12:19.774 --> 12:23.910
Caroline and Han are really
getting at it over there.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.912
This storm is turning people on

12:25.913 --> 12:28.782
more than alcohol and low self-esteem.

12:28.783 --> 12:31.384
Even Han got some action.

12:31.385 --> 12:34.054
I don't hold hands and tell.

12:34.055 --> 12:38.425
Or maybe I do. This is kind of a first.

12:38.426 --> 12:39.726
I could tell.

12:39.727 --> 12:42.596
Your thumb was all over the place.

12:42.597 --> 12:44.630
I hope that was your thumb.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.467
That's it.

12:47.468 --> 12:49.302
I can't risk Sophie being alone

12:49.303 --> 12:51.738
with the Elephant Manny any longer.

12:51.739 --> 12:54.908
Even a 2 like him looks
like a 5 in this bad weather,

12:54.909 --> 12:57.644
and Sophie has a thing for 5s.

12:57.645 --> 12:59.246
If I die, Max,

12:59.247 --> 13:02.449
you know what strippers
I want at my funeral.

13:02.450 --> 13:05.919
Yep, same ones I want at mine.

13:05.920 --> 13:08.154
I want Bagpipes at my funeral.

13:08.155 --> 13:12.025
She'll be expecting your call.

13:12.026 --> 13:14.794
The sexual tension is rising.

13:14.795 --> 13:19.631
This is turning into a
real "will we or won't we?"

13:20.767 --> 13:22.869
We won't.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.838
We can't!

13:26.607 --> 13:28.208
You know what I've always wanted to do?

13:28.209 --> 13:30.110
Have a "getting back together" party?

13:30.111 --> 13:32.946
Same price, less Adele on the playlist.

13:32.947 --> 13:34.214
No.

13:34.215 --> 13:36.550
You know. We should...

13:36.551 --> 13:38.285
Drive through Syria!

13:39.654 --> 13:41.388
Syria?

13:41.389 --> 13:44.057
Is that a new Middle
Eastern fast-food place?

13:45.226 --> 13:48.360
Baba ghano-thank-you.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.132
Syria sounds beautiful.

13:52.133 --> 13:54.167
Let us throw your going-away party.

13:54.168 --> 13:56.069
And birthdays coming up? Graduations?

13:56.070 --> 13:59.406
Quinceañeras? Just 'cause?

13:59.407 --> 14:01.141
Why almost die in Syria

14:01.142 --> 14:03.209
when we could be out there right now

14:03.210 --> 14:05.045
almost dying in a hurricane?

14:05.046 --> 14:10.150
Oh, there's the woman my
family forced me to marry.

14:10.151 --> 14:12.152
Every second we're in
here is second we're not

14:12.153 --> 14:14.654
risking getting electrocuted
by downed power lines.

14:14.655 --> 14:15.689
We'll see you guys later.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.658
Wha... we do funerals.

14:18.659 --> 14:19.893
Wakes, shivas, too.

14:19.894 --> 14:22.829
Tell your captors.

14:22.830 --> 14:24.364
Unbelievable.

14:24.365 --> 14:25.765
I'm so bad at relationships,

14:25.766 --> 14:28.401
I can't even make a divorce work.

14:28.402 --> 14:29.869
I'll give you some pointers.

14:29.870 --> 14:35.675
First rule, have sex with
her big-mouthed sister.

14:35.676 --> 14:38.211
I'm gonna see if Randy
posted anything on Snapchat

14:38.212 --> 14:39.879
about his travels.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.349
I know what you're
thinking, and you're wrong.

14:42.350 --> 14:45.452
He is not in LA, enjoying the sunshine.

14:45.453 --> 14:48.088
Hey, I'm here in sunny LA,

14:48.089 --> 14:50.123
just about to take my dog for a walk.

14:50.124 --> 14:52.559
You know, people are saying
we're starting to look alike.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.992
Thoughts?

14:57.597 --> 15:00.300
Because to tell you the
truth, I don't really see it.

15:00.301 --> 15:01.568
Although I have been

15:01.569 --> 15:05.204
peeing on fire hydrants more than usual.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.109
You know what?

15:09.110 --> 15:10.610
I am calling him.

15:10.611 --> 15:11.945
He wants me to.

15:11.946 --> 15:14.314
You saw the look on his snout.

15:14.315 --> 15:16.416
You're acting more mixed-up than me.

15:16.417 --> 15:21.087
And yesterday I ordered a
cheeseburger from an ATM.

15:21.088 --> 15:25.392
And I gotta say, it wasn't bad.

15:25.393 --> 15:27.927
He's not answering, and it's
going straight to voicemail.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.596
Maybe Snapchat got it wrong

15:29.597 --> 15:30.597
and he's on a plane.

15:30.598 --> 15:33.767
He probably blocked you.

15:33.768 --> 15:35.634
Right, baby?

15:38.004 --> 15:40.106
Give me your phone.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.841
Hello?

15:41.842 --> 15:44.911
It went through and he answered.

15:44.912 --> 15:47.514
'Cause it wasn't my
phone. He did block me.

15:47.515 --> 15:49.516
Max, I'm sorry.

15:49.517 --> 15:51.951
We're really broken up.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.287
Don't feel too bad.

15:54.288 --> 15:57.823
From what I saw, he
had kind of a dog face.

15:58.992 --> 15:59.993
Ooh-ooh.

15:59.994 --> 16:01.361
My hips think that

16:01.362 --> 16:02.929
the storm is over, y'all.

16:02.930 --> 16:06.266
Why don't you go check
for flooding, old man?

16:06.267 --> 16:09.769
Just like you did for Noah.

16:09.770 --> 16:13.373
Sorry, that's the cockiness
of my new relationship talking.

16:13.374 --> 16:15.041
We should all go.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.844
None of us have anything left
to live for anymore anyway.

16:17.845 --> 16:20.113
Uh, excuse me, I have plenty...

16:20.114 --> 16:21.948
okay, you're right, let's go.

16:34.273 --> 16:36.441
Yes! Yes, it's okay.

16:36.442 --> 16:37.775
Wow.

16:37.776 --> 16:40.097
I guess the hurricane
looked us up on Yelp

16:40.098 --> 16:42.799
and stayed the hell away.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.534
It survived the storm!

16:44.535 --> 16:46.269
My diner's alive.

16:46.270 --> 16:50.106
Yeah, parts of it have
chased me around the kitchen.

16:50.107 --> 16:53.276
I love how you're funny.

16:53.277 --> 16:56.446
The storm is gone. My body got it right.

16:56.447 --> 16:59.314
Now, if it could only
pump blood on its own.

17:01.184 --> 17:02.185
Great.

17:02.186 --> 17:03.453
Oleg survived too.

17:03.454 --> 17:06.723
This hurricane sucked.

17:06.723 --> 17:08.023
I made it home,

17:08.025 --> 17:10.460
but Sophie and the Manny were gone.

17:10.461 --> 17:12.929
And I could tell by the
look in Chestnut's eyes

17:12.930 --> 17:15.798
and the wine on his mane
that they're not coming back.

17:19.301 --> 17:22.003
Oh... Oleg, you're here!

17:26.242 --> 17:27.444
Sophie,

17:27.444 --> 17:29.012
you're here.

17:29.013 --> 17:31.615
Oh, I was so worried. What happened?

17:31.616 --> 17:33.583
To my churro?

17:33.584 --> 17:36.119
Well, yeah, it got wet.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.754
Oh, Oleg,

17:37.755 --> 17:40.757
I didn't want to be in
the hurricane without you.

17:40.758 --> 17:43.293
And I didn't want anyone to be in you

17:43.294 --> 17:44.327
without me.

17:44.328 --> 17:45.829
Oh.

17:45.830 --> 17:48.632
Don't be silly. We're family now.

17:48.633 --> 17:51.701
Plus, the storm got me all horned up.

17:51.702 --> 17:53.536
Confession:

17:53.537 --> 17:56.239
I'm not just wet from the storm.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.874
Oh, my God,

17:57.875 --> 18:01.276
does this guy always
know what to say or what?

18:03.280 --> 18:05.348
Oh, Oleg, let's go home.

18:05.349 --> 18:07.484
I love happy endings.

18:07.485 --> 18:10.854
Oh, well, if Barbara's sleeping,

18:10.855 --> 18:13.021
I might be able to give
you one on the way home.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.795
Caroline,

18:18.796 --> 18:21.264
we need to talk about
what happened in there.

18:21.265 --> 18:23.199
Okay, but do I have to be here?

18:23.200 --> 18:26.903
Look, I've been thinking that sometimes

18:26.904 --> 18:29.739
crazy weather makes you do crazy things.

18:29.740 --> 18:31.608
Yeah, I just listened
to Sophie and Oleg talk

18:31.609 --> 18:33.777
for like an hour.

18:33.778 --> 18:36.913
I... I guess what I'm trying to say is

18:36.914 --> 18:38.348
we're dones-ville.

18:38.349 --> 18:39.382
Han.

18:39.383 --> 18:40.582
Shh.

18:44.154 --> 18:45.155
No, no.

18:45.156 --> 18:46.456
Don't beg.

18:46.457 --> 18:48.591
This is hard enough as it is.

18:48.592 --> 18:49.893
But...

18:49.894 --> 18:51.760
keep that chin up.

18:53.797 --> 18:55.265
You'll find someone.

18:55.266 --> 18:57.600
I recommend the Internet.

18:57.601 --> 18:58.902
Thanks, Han.

18:58.903 --> 19:00.702
It was fun while it never started.

19:03.573 --> 19:06.543
Max, I hate seeing you like this.

19:06.544 --> 19:07.911
You know what?

19:07.912 --> 19:09.713
Maybe Randy only blocked you because...

19:09.714 --> 19:11.715
Because he didn't want to
ruin the surprise of him

19:11.716 --> 19:12.948
coming here to see me?

19:14.951 --> 19:16.953
All right. Yep. Sure.

19:16.954 --> 19:18.955
I'm gonna check his Snapchat again.

19:18.956 --> 19:21.124
Not now, Max. Let's
go hug our dessert bar.

19:21.125 --> 19:24.094
It was probably so scared.

19:24.095 --> 19:26.529
Hey! I'm running 'cause I'm late.

19:26.530 --> 19:29.199
Gotta get to New York...

19:29.200 --> 19:30.767
Great, his story cut off.

19:30.768 --> 19:31.935
But you were right!

19:31.936 --> 19:33.336
I was?

19:33.337 --> 19:34.938
Ooh, it unfroze.

19:34.939 --> 19:37.806
Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl.

19:41.544 --> 19:43.079
Well, that's it.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.614
He's not coming to New York.

19:44.615 --> 19:46.282
I have to face reality.

19:46.283 --> 19:49.751
He's bowling in LA with his buddy Phil.

19:54.859 --> 19:56.226
Oh, my God!

19:56.227 --> 19:57.694
Cray, right?

19:57.695 --> 20:00.930
I didn't even know Randy liked bowling.

20:00.931 --> 20:02.564
No, Max, look!

20:04.467 --> 20:08.138
Is that tree new or has
it always been there?

20:08.139 --> 20:11.141
I know the condom stuck to it hasn't.

20:11.142 --> 20:15.245
The diner is fine, but
our beautiful dessert bar

20:15.246 --> 20:17.680
gets hit by the hurricane?

20:17.681 --> 20:18.882
But...

20:18.883 --> 20:21.451
your hair looks good right now.

20:21.452 --> 20:23.085
Just "good"?

20:24.621 --> 20:26.122
I'm calling Han.

20:26.123 --> 20:29.125
I weirdly feel like I need him now.

20:29.126 --> 20:32.529
It's going straight to voicemail.

20:32.530 --> 20:34.931
Han! I was just trying to call you.

20:34.932 --> 20:37.199
Yeah, I blocked you.

20:38.835 --> 20:40.602
I just can't go there right now.

20:43.940 --> 20:45.408
Caroline, don't cry.

20:45.409 --> 20:47.644
We have insurance. Right?

20:47.645 --> 20:49.679
I don't listen to 100% of what you say.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.348
We'll be fine.

20:52.349 --> 20:55.218
I just think blocking a person is mean.
