00:23.023 --> 00:26.060

A FORMAL PROTEST.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.528
- NOTED.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.363
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
OF EVERYTHING?

00:29.397 --> 00:31.199
- COURSE NOT.

00:31.232 --> 00:36.137
IT DOESN'T OCCUR TO ME HOW
TO ENGINEER MY OWN DESTRUCTION.

00:36.170 --> 00:39.607
- WE CROSSED THE MISSOURI
LIKE THIS,

00:39.640 --> 00:42.610
GREATER RIVER THAN THE CROW.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.546
- THICKER ICE,
COLDER WEATHER.

00:45.579 --> 00:51.051
- AND LARGER BALLS
THAN MY CHIEF ENGINEER.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.356
- [chuckles]
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.226
- WHO HOLDIN' THE MONEY?

00:59.727 --> 01:01.562
EVERYBODY IN?
- UH-HUH.

01:01.595 --> 01:04.365
- YOU THERE, BIG FELLA.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.634
- THEY CALL ME PSALMS,
MR. DURANT.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.237
- PSALMS, YES, OF COURSE,
PSALMS.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.705
WHAT'S THE WAGER?

01:11.739 --> 01:14.342
- HOW FAR ACROSS
BEFORE THE ENGINEER JUMP.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.581
- YOU DON'T THINK
THE TRAIN'S GONNA MAKE IT?

01:20.614 --> 01:22.783
- I AIN'T BETTIN'
AGAINST THE RAILROAD ITSELF,

01:22.816 --> 01:25.819
MR. DURANT,
JUST THE ENGINEER.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.488
- [laughs]

01:27.521 --> 01:29.290
OF COURSE.

01:32.660 --> 01:36.330

MR. DURANT.

- YOU GET ATTACKED BY INDIANS
NOW OR SET FIRE TO,

05:01.502 --> 05:03.404
WON'T HAVE TO GO
DOWN TO THE RIVER.

05:03.437 --> 05:07.375
- YOU'LL NOT BE HERE,
SHOULD THAT HAPPEN?

05:07.408 --> 05:09.643
- GAVE YOU MY WORD,

05:09.677 --> 05:12.946
I'D BE HERE TILL THE CROPS
IS IN, BABY'S BORN.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.815
NAOMI'S DUE ANY DAY NOW.

05:14.848 --> 05:18.051
ONLY THING KEEPING ME HERE
AFTER THAT'LL BE BISHOP DUTSON.

05:18.085 --> 05:22.022
- WELL, YOU HAVE HONORED
YOUR WORD TO ME.

05:22.055 --> 05:26.494
NO DOUBT,
HE'LL FEEL THE SAME.

05:26.527 --> 05:31.131
- I TRY TO WALK OUT THAT GATE,
HE'LL PUT A BULLET IN MY BACK.

05:31.164 --> 05:35.135
- BISHOP DUTSON IS NOT
THE MAN YOU CLAIM HIM TO BE.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.539
- FATHER HATCH,
I KEEP TELLING YOU,

05:38.572 --> 05:40.408
HE AIN'T THE MAN
HE CLAIMS TO BE.

05:40.408 --> 05:43.911
- AN IMPOSTER COULD NEVER
LAY ON HANDS

05:43.944 --> 05:47.915
AND SPEAK IN TONGUES
LIKE BISHOP DUTSON.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.550

05:49.583 --> 05:52.553
YEAH.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.455
ONE DAY YOU'LL SEE.

05:58.792 --> 06:02.563
- CLOSE THE GATE!

06:07.601 --> 06:10.538
- BROTHER BOHANNON.
- HOW'S CHEYENNE?

06:10.571 --> 06:13.574
- SODOM AND GOMORRAH'S
GOT NOTHING ON IT.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.749
- RAILROAD STARTED
STOCKPILING RAIL YET?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.584
- RAILROAD'S STUCK AND BUSTED.
I DID HEAR

06:23.617 --> 06:27.488
THE CAVALRY'S GOT THE COMANCHE
ON THE RUN, THOUGH.

06:27.521 --> 06:30.057
- MIND YOU DON'T GET
A HAIRCUT NEXT TIME.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.726
- SLIM PICKINGS.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.927

ON THE NEW WELL.

OH, TRY TO ENJOY GOD'S PEACE
WITHIN THESE WALLS.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.951
IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER
I'M IN A PRISON.

06:57.985 --> 07:02.623
- YOU ARE A FREE MAN,
BROTHER BOHANNON.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.957

FIGHT WITH THEIR FISTS.

USUALLY, THEY REACH
RIGHT FOR THEIR KNIVES AND GUNS.

[gunshot]

07:32.953 --> 07:34.555

FOR THE MATERIAL

07:39.126 --> 07:41.061
LOST IN THE RIVER.

07:45.566 --> 07:49.870
- I DON'T HAVE
THIS KIND OF MONEY ON HAND.

07:49.903 --> 07:54.642
- FIND IT, OR THE CENTRAL
PACIFIC WILL MEET US HERE...

07:54.675 --> 07:57.177
IN THIS GODFORSAKEN PLACE.

08:22.736 --> 08:25.172

08:25.205 --> 08:28.576
YOUR WIFE IS UNHAPPY HERE,
I TAKE IT.

08:36.049 --> 08:40.588
- HER FATHER WAS
ONE OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS.

08:40.588 --> 08:43.724
HE GOES MISSING,
YOU DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.

08:43.757 --> 08:47.595
- WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WE LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

08:50.063 --> 08:53.601
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY SHOULD
HAVE DINNER SOMETIME,

08:53.634 --> 08:56.069
SO WE CAN REACQUAINT.
I CAN EXPLAIN IT TO HER.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.772
- OH, SHE'D LOVE THAT,

08:58.806 --> 09:00.107
SINCE SHE WORRIES
YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO

09:00.140 --> 09:03.677
WITH HIS DISAPPEARANCE.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.680
- WHO COULD POSSIBLY HAVE PUT
SUCH A HAREBRAINED IDEA

09:06.714 --> 09:09.883
IN HER HEAD?
- A BOSTON DETECTIVE.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.219
THE ONE WHO CAME OUT HERE
LAST YEAR.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.958
- HER FATHER,
SENATOR METCALF,

09:17.991 --> 09:23.063
WAS ONE OF MY OLDEST
AND CLOSEST FRIENDS.

09:23.096 --> 09:26.634
I WAS HER GODFATHER,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES!

09:26.634 --> 09:28.736
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
SO FRIGHTENING FOR HER.

09:32.272 --> 09:37.678
- I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO ANSWER HER QUESTIONS.

09:37.711 --> 09:42.783
MEANWHILE, ADVISE YOUR WIFE
TO BE CAUTIOUS.

09:42.816 --> 09:46.153
CHEYENNE
IS A DANGEROUS PLACE.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.684
- EVA?

10:16.717 --> 10:18.652
- HOWDY, MR. DURANT.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.292
- EVA, SURELY,
YOU CAN FIND

10:25.325 --> 10:28.962
SOMETHING MORE SUITABLE
THAN WASHING WHORES' BEDDING.

10:28.996 --> 10:32.966
- WELL, MICKEY WAS GOOD
TO GIVE ME THE WORK.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.636
IT'S EITHER THIS
OR GO BACK TO WHORING.

10:38.071 --> 10:42.042
- LOOK AT ME, EVA.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.377
THE EYES OF THE WORLD
ARE UPON ME,

10:44.411 --> 10:46.714
AS I STAND
ON THE VERGE OF RUIN.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.850
HARASSED ON ALL SIDES,
MY WIFE LEFT ME

10:49.883 --> 10:52.986
WHILE I WAS IN PRISON,
I HAVE NO FRIENDS,

10:53.020 --> 10:57.858
BUT YOU DON'T SEE ME CRYING,
DO YOU?

10:57.891 --> 11:00.327
NO, SO PICK YOURSELF UP.

11:03.396 --> 11:07.000
- YES, MR. DURANT.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.169
- GOOD.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.844
MR. MAYOR.
[men cheering]

11:16.877 --> 11:20.480
- [clears throat]
- I AM SEEKING COUNSEL.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.851

ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS.

11:27.755 --> 11:35.195

11:35.228 --> 11:37.998
- AHH.
THE RAILROAD IS BROKE.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.033
- MM-HMM.

11:40.067 --> 11:43.003
- IF YOU WERE ME,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

11:43.036 --> 11:46.940
- HISTORICALLY, SIR,
YOU'D HAVE GONE BACK EAST

11:46.974 --> 11:51.912
AND SOLD A BUNCH OF PHONY PAPER
FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,

11:51.945 --> 11:54.915
BUT AFTER SINKING
THE TRAIN,

11:54.948 --> 11:57.184
I'D SAY YOU HAVE
CREDIBILITY CONCERNS.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.921
- CORRECT,
SO WHAT WOULD YOU DO NOW?

12:00.954 --> 12:03.390
- SELL OFF ANYTHING YOU HAVE
OF VALUE,

12:03.423 --> 12:05.826
INCLUDING THAT WATCH.

12:05.859 --> 12:10.864
I'LL GIVE YOU A FIVER FOR IT.
- [laughs]

12:10.898 --> 12:15.936
I HAVE LAND, 20 ACRES
EITHER SIDE OF THE TRACK,

12:15.969 --> 12:21.942
AND ANY LAND I CAN CLAIM
MINERAL RIGHTS TO.

12:21.975 --> 12:26.246
- YOU SHOULD SELL IT...
AT AUCTION.

12:27.915 --> 12:30.383
- AND YOU SHOULD BUY IT,
AT AUCTION.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.953
- I DON'T WANT IT,

12:32.986 --> 12:36.223
AND I DON'T WANT
THAT KIND OF TROUBLE.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.960
- I MADE YOU MAYOR.
I MADE YOU RICH.

12:39.993 --> 12:45.866
YOU ARRIVED WITH A MAGIC SHOW
AND A DOPEY SMILE.

12:45.899 --> 12:50.203
YOU COULD LEAVE
WITH A LOT LESS.

12:53.941 --> 12:57.244
POST A NOTICE,
SOMETHING OFFICIAL.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.847
OH, AND BRING CASH.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.983
AND FOR GOD SAKES,
GET EVA OUT OF THE MUD.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.285
- SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT
TO BE PULLED OUT OF THE MUD,

13:05.318 --> 13:06.954
MR. DURANT.

13:06.987 --> 13:10.457
- TRUE.
DON'T BE ONE OF THEM.

13:15.195 --> 13:18.999
[background chatter,
piano playing, man singing]

13:30.077 --> 13:32.880
- HERE.

13:41.521 --> 13:45.258
GO AHEAD AND READ IT.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.634
YOUR RAILROAD'S FALLEN BEHIND
DURING THE WINTER.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.004
- DURANT SUNK A TRAIN
INTO THE CROW RIVER

13:57.037 --> 13:59.039
AND CALLED IT
A MINOR SETBACK, SO...

13:59.072 --> 14:01.942
- HE STRUGGLES, PROBABLY
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT THERE.

14:05.078 --> 14:11.418
- "CHIEF ENGINEER MARTIN DELANEY
ANNOUNCED TODAY."

14:11.451 --> 14:14.988
DAMN IT!
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

14:15.022 --> 14:18.325
- WHAT IS IT?
- I CAN'T BELIEVE

14:18.358 --> 14:21.929
DURANT HADN'T FIRED THAT IDIOT
MARTIN DELANEY BY NOW.

14:21.929 --> 14:25.298
I BEAT HIM OUT FOR THE JOB
ONCE ALREADY.

14:27.100 --> 14:31.538
- I KNOW HOW MUCH
THAT RAILROAD MEANS TO YOU.

14:31.571 --> 14:34.074
YOU CAME OUT HERE
TO BUILD IT,

14:34.107 --> 14:37.444
NOT LIVE A LIFE AMONG PEOPLE
WHO AREN'T YOUR OWN,

14:37.477 --> 14:41.081
WITH A WIFE
THAT YOU MAY NOT LOVE.

15:06.139 --> 15:11.044
- COME TO THE RAILROAD
HUNTIN'...

15:11.078 --> 15:14.614
THE MEN WHO MURDERED
MY WIFE AND CHILD.

15:18.118 --> 15:22.255
KILLED THE ONES
I COULD FIND.

15:22.289 --> 15:27.160
NOW, NAOMI...

15:30.330 --> 15:33.300
YOU'RE MARRIED TO A KILLER.

15:43.176 --> 15:47.180
- YOU'RE JUST TRYIN' TO SCARE ME
INTO NOT LOVIN' YOU

15:47.214 --> 15:49.616
SO YOU CAN LEAVE.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.751
- NO, I'M JUST BEIN'
TRUTHFUL IS ALL.

15:55.622 --> 15:59.626
- YOU CAN LEAVE, CULLEN.

15:59.659 --> 16:03.363
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

16:34.161 --> 16:38.065
[low chatter]

16:43.603 --> 16:45.572
- THANK YOU.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.440

16:49.409 --> 16:53.213
- BREAD, HUSBAND?

16:53.246 --> 16:57.084
- WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT?
REST A SPELL.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.521
THERE YOU GO.

17:01.554 --> 17:05.258
[footsteps approaching]

17:13.600 --> 17:16.536
- WELL, I'M GLAD.

17:16.569 --> 17:20.107
AFTER FOUR MONTHS AMONG US,
YOU'RE MAKING FRIENDS.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.342
- I CAN COUNT 'EM
ALL ON ONE FINGER.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.452
- I TALK TO HIM,
HE TALKS TO ME.

17:32.485 --> 17:37.257
- ESPECIALLY WHEN HE RETURNS
FROM HIS TRIPS TO CHEYENNE.

17:41.428 --> 17:45.498
LET GO OF CHEYENNE,
YOUR FORMER LIFE.

17:48.601 --> 17:52.339
- UH-HUH.
- MM.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.545
- I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING, BISHOP.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.347
- YES?

18:02.415 --> 18:04.751
- THAT THING YOU SAID
ABOUT FREEDOM EARLIER.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.287
- HMM?

18:07.320 --> 18:09.489
- I THINK I FINALLY
UNDERSTAND IT.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.825
- GOOD.
GOOD!

18:12.859 --> 18:17.564
- AND--AND SOMETHING ELSE.
- MM-HMM?

18:17.597 --> 18:20.167
- I HAD ME A VISION.

18:22.435 --> 18:26.173
- TELL ME.

18:26.173 --> 18:31.311
- I HAD ME A VISION
THAT I WAS LEAVING THIS PLACE.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.815
- BUT WHY?

18:35.848 --> 18:40.620
TH-THERE'S STILL...
SO MUCH TO BE DONE WITH YOU.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.356

18:43.390 --> 18:47.460
SAW MYSELF WALKIN' STRAIGHT
THROUGH THAT GATE.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.796
- NO, NO.
- WALKIN' RIGHT OUT

18:49.829 --> 18:52.265
THROUGH THAT GATE,
WHISTLING DIXIE.

18:52.299 --> 18:59.906
- YOU--YOU WOULD NOT ABANDON
YOUR WIFE AND CHILD.

19:04.877 --> 19:09.216
- YEAH.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.484
I WOULDN'T WORRY NONE.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.824
IT'S JUST A VISION.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.327

19:33.906 --> 19:38.411

GENERAL GRANT WILL SEE YOU NOW.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.250
- GENERAL GRANT.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.855
- WITH MY ELECTION ASSURED,
I'M SENDING YOU WEST, CAMPBELL.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.524
WYOMING.
EVER HEAR OF IT?

19:51.558 --> 19:53.893
- VAGUELY.
- LAWLESS PLACE.

19:53.926 --> 19:57.697
UNION PACIFIC HAS GOTTEN
ITSELF BOGGED DOWN OUT THERE.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.599
THINGS ARE RUNNING AMOK.

- I DON'T THINK I'M THE MAN
YOU WANT TO SEND THERE.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.876
- YOU WILL NOT BE
RETURNING TO ATLANTA.

20:09.909 --> 20:13.546
- MY WORK THERE
IS INCOMPLETE.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.683
- I'M SAVING YOU FROM YOURSELF,
CAMPBELL.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.419
YOU WERE A BIT OVERZEALOUS.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.788
- MISTAKES WERE MADE,
BUT ORDER WAS RESTORED.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.890
- AND YOU'LL DO THE SAME
AS THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNOR

20:23.923 --> 20:27.560

[door closes,
crowd noise muffled]

20:49.582 --> 20:51.418
[all cheering]
- THE GREATEST GOOD

20:51.451 --> 20:54.821
TO THE GREATEST NUMBER
IS THE OBJECT TO ATTAIN.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.556

20:56.589 --> 20:58.958
THIS REQUIRES SECURITY OF PERSON

- GENTLEMEN,
THE GENERAL IS VERY PLEASED

21:02.362 --> 21:04.597
WITH OUR SUCCESS IN ATLANTA.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.666
- HE'S NOT GIVING US
THE BOOT?

21:06.699 --> 21:07.967

21:08.000 --> 21:10.670
HE APPOINTED ME GOVERNOR

- THE FRONTIER.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.344
IT'S A WILDERNESS.

21:17.344 --> 21:19.346
THIS IS WORSE
THAN GETTING THE BOOT.

21:19.379 --> 21:22.615
- WELL, NOT SO FAST.
THERE'S GOLD OUT WEST.

OF HOODED RASCALS,

21:31.991 --> 21:34.494
A CITY IN ASHES.

21:34.527 --> 21:37.797
IT'S WILD, SURELY,
BUT SO IS AN UNBROKEN HORSE.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.933
WE'LL BREAK IT.

21:40.967 --> 21:44.871
YOU'LL BE PROVISIONAL MARSHAL

21:44.904 --> 21:46.806
YOU'LL BE THE JUDGE.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.476
YOU'LL BE THE TREASURER.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.811

MAGGIE.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.588

23:08.621 --> 23:10.957
I THOUGHT WE HAD AN AGREEMENT
ABOUT THE USE OF THIS U.P. LAND

23:10.990 --> 23:12.892

FOR A RANGE WAR,

23:27.940 --> 23:29.075
JUST SAY, "BARBED WIRE."

23:29.108 --> 23:34.481

24:55.662 --> 25:00.733
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU HAD TO DRAW A GUN

25:00.767 --> 25:04.671
OR RAISE A HAND IN VIOLENCE?

25:04.704 --> 25:07.239
ISN'T THERE A PEACE IN THAT?

I WAS HOPING DIGGING THIS HOLE
INTO THE EARTH

BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WIFE

WHOSE ARRIVAL MAY BE
HERALDED AS WE SPEAK.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.744

25:53.720 --> 25:57.724

- AHEM.

34:47.319 --> 34:50.289
YOU PROMISED MY HUSBAND
A LIFE FOR A LIFE

34:50.322 --> 34:52.158
AFTER YOU HUNG MY SON.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.471
- THERE'S MORE TO IT
THAN THAT.

35:05.504 --> 35:10.642
- YES, THERE IS.

35:10.676 --> 35:16.782
EVERY TIME I SEE YOU,
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS MY JEB

35:16.815 --> 35:21.220
SWINGING FROM THAT
HORRIBLE NOOSE AT YOUR HAND.

35:21.253 --> 35:24.856
- I'M SORRY, MOTHER HATCH.
- [scoffs]

35:24.890 --> 35:31.863
IT'S NOT YOUR--
YOUR SORROW, YOUR PITY I WANT.

35:31.897 --> 35:35.434
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE
THIS PLACE.

35:35.467 --> 35:40.506
THE SIGHT OF YOU SICKENS ME,
AS IT DOES OTHERS.

35:43.375 --> 35:47.379
NAOMI WILL RAISE THE CHILD
AS HER BROTHER.

35:47.413 --> 35:53.285
HIS NAME SHALL BE
JEBEDIAH HATCH.

35:53.319 --> 35:58.657
IN TIME,
YOU WILL BE FORGOTTEN.

35:58.690 --> 36:03.229
NAOMI IS YOUNG AND HEALTHY
AND WILL OUTLIVE HER HUSBANDS,

36:03.229 --> 36:06.632
AS IS OUR CUSTOM...

36:06.665 --> 36:10.236
BEGINNING WITH YOU.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.795
- JESUS.

36:38.730 --> 36:42.268
[murmurs, grunts]

36:51.643 --> 36:54.780
- [whimpers]
- SHH, SHH.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.419
- [whimpers]

37:00.452 --> 37:02.388
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
- [whimpers]

37:02.421 --> 37:04.956
- I'VE DONE ALL I CAN
FOR YOU, EVA.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.625
TWICE I GAVE YOU TRAIN FARE
OUT OF THIS PLACE,

37:06.658 --> 37:08.894
AND YOU STILL DON'T LEAVE.
- [sobs]

37:08.927 --> 37:12.464
- SHH.
- [whimpers]

37:12.498 --> 37:15.434
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR ME
IN THIS WORLD, MICKEY.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.737
- YOU BRING IT ALL
ON YOURSELF.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.573
YOU INVOLVED YOURSELF
WITH A...NEGRO.

37:21.607 --> 37:26.578
- [sobs]

37:26.612 --> 37:30.749
I LOVED ELAM.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.784
- YOU LOVED HIM SO MUCH

37:32.818 --> 37:37.623
THAT YOU GAVE AWAY
THE BABY THAT HE ADORED.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.024
- [hisses]

37:40.926 --> 37:42.861
- THAT AIN'T RIGHT.

37:48.867 --> 37:51.370
YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE
LEFT OFF THE WHORING.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.541
YOU WERE GOOD AT THAT.

37:57.843 --> 38:01.680
A NATURAL.

38:01.713 --> 38:07.619
ALL WOMEN ARE WHORES
BY NATURE...

38:07.653 --> 38:10.356
I SUPPOSE
EXCEPT FOR ME MUM.

38:16.495 --> 38:21.066
IT'S THE ONE THING
THAT ALL WOMEN HAVE IN COMMON.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.037
WHORING.

38:30.509 --> 38:33.979
JUST WHORES.

38:34.012 --> 38:37.649
AT THE END OF THE DAY...

38:37.683 --> 38:39.818
THEY'RE ALL WHORES.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.992
- IS EVERYTHING WHERE
YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE?

38:47.025 --> 38:50.462
- WHAT?

38:50.496 --> 38:54.866
- I SAID, "IS EVERYTHING
WHERE YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE?"

38:57.703 --> 39:00.839
- I--

39:00.872 --> 39:03.675
I WOULDN'T--

39:03.709 --> 39:06.011
DIDN'T MEAN TO.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.829
- MAGGIE!
JOIN ME.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.864
- I ACTUALLY LIKED YOU
UNTIL TODAY.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.699
- OH, YOU STILL LIKE ME.

39:27.733 --> 39:30.769
YOU JUST DON'T TRUST ME.
THAT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL.

39:33.805 --> 39:38.877
I HAD TO DO IT, MAGGIE.
I NEEDED THE MONEY.

39:38.910 --> 39:42.648
- SO HERE YOU SIT
WITH YOUR MONEY, ALONE.

39:45.116 --> 39:48.554
- I'M EXPECTING THE NEW
GOVERNOR OF THE TERRITORY.

39:48.587 --> 39:49.955
HIS TRAIN IS LATE.

39:49.988 --> 39:54.593
- ONE DAY, YOU WILL NEED
SOMEONE THAT YOU CAN TRUST.

39:54.626 --> 39:58.997
ALL YOU'LL FIND
IS A ROOM OF...EMPTY CHAIRS.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.772
- I HAVE BAGS
JUST LIKE THOSE.

40:06.805 --> 40:09.875
- OH, THOSE ARE YOUR BAGS,

40:09.908 --> 40:11.610
AND HERE IS YOUR BILL.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.411
- BILL?

40:24.923 --> 40:27.659
- FIGURED YOU'D BRING
THE THREAT.

40:27.693 --> 40:29.094
- A PLEA.

40:29.127 --> 40:32.163
- WELL, THINGS CAN BE
TWO AT ONCE IN YOUR MOUTH.

40:32.197 --> 40:37.068
YOU KILL ME OUTRIGHT,
YOU'LL BE SEEN FOR WHAT YOU ARE.

40:37.102 --> 40:40.939
HMM.
I KILL YOU OUTRIGHT,

40:40.972 --> 40:44.109
YOU'D BE SOME KIND OF SAINT,
AND I'D HANG.

40:44.142 --> 40:50.949
- ONCE OUTSIDE THOSE GATES,
I CANNOT GUARANTEE YOUR SAFETY.

40:50.982 --> 40:55.954
- OUR SAFETY.
TAKING MY FAMILY WITH ME.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.789
- YOUR FAMILY?

40:57.823 --> 40:59.457
- THAT'S RIGHT.

41:01.660 --> 41:06.231
- OH.
HMM.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.241
[gates thud closed]

41:24.315 --> 41:27.686
- YOU NOT ALLOWING ME
TO LEAVE...

41:27.719 --> 41:30.956
IS THAT AS BISHOP DUTSON,

41:30.989 --> 41:36.695
OR AS THE SWEDE,
ALSO KNOWN AS THOR GUNDERSEN?

41:36.728 --> 41:42.267
- THE LATE THOR GUNDERSEN
WAS NORWEGIAN.

41:43.702 --> 41:46.838
- OH.

41:46.872 --> 41:49.207
WELL...

41:49.240 --> 41:52.578
WHOEVER YOU ARE...

41:52.578 --> 41:55.180
YOU BETTER SHOOT TO KILL.

41:57.683 --> 42:02.588
I'M COMING BACK TO FINISH THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.
