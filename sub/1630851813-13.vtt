WEBVTT

00:25.112 --> 00:27.070
You know, if you
get back in bed,

00:27.114 --> 00:30.030
I'm pretty sure nothing
bad can happen today.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.599
Is that how it works?
Just, uh, you know,

00:34.643 --> 00:37.341
close the blinds,
pull up the covers and, uh...

00:37.385 --> 00:40.301
- Pancakes. Banana pancakes.
- Yeah, well,

00:40.344 --> 00:41.215
I'd probably burn 'em.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.433
Oh, I know you would.

00:42.477 --> 00:44.566
Thanks.

00:44.609 --> 00:47.047
Did you get
any sleep?

00:47.090 --> 00:49.440
Yeah, yeah. You know, uh,

00:49.484 --> 00:53.140
maybe a couple minutes between
4:00 a.m. and-and rooster.

00:54.184 --> 00:57.100
Just thinking about Bonham's
- bail hearing all night?
- Yeah.

00:57.144 --> 00:59.189
And what I'm gonna
say to the ranch hands.

00:59.233 --> 01:02.845
And how to even start packing.

01:02.888 --> 01:05.021
And why the hell

01:05.065 --> 01:07.067
I went back
for Dan Miller. And...

01:07.110 --> 01:09.112
Okay. I think that's enough

01:09.156 --> 01:11.680
"ands" for one morning.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.377
You know what?

01:13.421 --> 01:15.727
Cordi? You clearly need

01:15.771 --> 01:17.512
your one good thing.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.514
My-my what, now?

01:19.557 --> 01:20.950
Your one good thing.

01:20.993 --> 01:22.169
It's something my
dad used to do.

01:22.212 --> 01:23.953
Back when we used to move a lot.

01:23.996 --> 01:26.042
Back when Frank
was taking you all over

01:26.086 --> 01:27.435
- for the heart treatments?
- Yeah.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.915
Every moving day,
Dad would have something

01:29.959 --> 01:32.831
waiting for me. One good thing.
A gift. A meal.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.921
You know,
s-something special.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.227
It made

01:37.271 --> 01:40.839
days like today feel
a little less...

01:40.883 --> 01:43.190
A little less, uh, painful?

01:43.233 --> 01:44.408
Exactly.

01:44.452 --> 01:45.888
He was a port in the storm.

01:45.931 --> 01:47.890
And maybe you can be, too.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.379
Mama, morning.

01:58.422 --> 01:59.858
- Hey.
- Yeah. It's, uh, time, Cordell.

01:59.902 --> 02:00.903
- Yeah.
- Morning, Geri.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.383
Hey.

02:04.907 --> 02:08.650
One good thing. All right.

02:08.693 --> 02:12.001
Well, let me tell you, uh...

02:13.220 --> 02:14.699
...it's not gonna be this.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.877
How do you end an era

02:18.921 --> 02:21.184
almost 150 years in the making?

02:23.230 --> 02:24.883
I don't know the answer

02:24.927 --> 02:27.886
to that, and the man who would

02:27.930 --> 02:30.324
have the answer to that
can't be here.

02:32.587 --> 02:36.199
<i>Families were born here.</i>
<i>Friendships cemented.</i>

02:36.243 --> 02:37.809
<i>Boy, we had</i>
<i>some good times, too.</i>

02:39.985 --> 02:41.683
Christmas parties. Barbecues.

02:41.726 --> 02:45.339
Uh, Fourth of July fireworks,
right over there.

02:45.382 --> 02:46.949
<i>Y'all remember.</i>

02:46.992 --> 02:48.255
<i>But there were some hiccups.</i>
<i>You know,</i>

02:48.298 --> 02:50.213
<i>we had some</i>
<i>failed businesses. I mean,</i>

02:50.257 --> 02:52.389
<i>who-who really ever needed</i>

02:52.433 --> 02:53.999
<i>Walker Hooch?</i>

02:58.439 --> 03:00.005
I've known some of you for, uh,

03:00.049 --> 03:01.355
longer than I can remember.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.407
Others, not quite as long.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.104
But I want

03:12.148 --> 03:14.933
if you ever did one honest day's
work at Walker Ranch,

03:14.977 --> 03:16.892
then you are family.

03:22.811 --> 03:24.508
How's it coming with the prep?

03:27.424 --> 03:30.253
One thing I just

03:30.297 --> 03:32.864
why did Dad bury that lantern?

03:33.648 --> 03:34.692
It was the murder weapon.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.303
Because he didn't know
what it was.

03:37.956 --> 03:40.045
But what he did know
is that lantern

03:40.089 --> 03:42.657
has brought this family
nothing but pain for years.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.875
Good riddance.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.573
Now, could you please
sit down and eat?

03:45.616 --> 03:47.009
You need to be at
your fighting weight

03:47.052 --> 03:48.402
to bring your
father home today.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.361
- Right?
- Yes, ma'am.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.758
<i>My daddy always says,</i>

03:56.801 --> 03:59.369
uh...

03:59.413 --> 04:00.979
...family shoots you straight.

04:01.023 --> 04:03.547
Tells you how it is.
So, that's why I wanted

04:03.591 --> 04:06.246
everyone together here today,
one last time,

04:06.289 --> 04:08.552
uh, for, uh...

04:12.991 --> 04:15.472
...for the last day
of operations at Walker Ranch.

04:16.517 --> 04:18.649
I wanted to thank you
for all the blood and sweat

04:18.693 --> 04:22.349
you've poured into this place.
I also wanted to

04:22.392 --> 04:25.917
be here to answer any questions,
- uh, you might have.
- So, what,

04:25.961 --> 04:28.268
25 years and all we get

04:28.311 --> 04:30.574
is "I'm sorry,

04:30.618 --> 04:32.184
"grab a handful of peppers
out of the patch

04:32.228 --> 04:33.664
- on your way out"?
- I don't know what the Davidsons'

04:33.708 --> 04:37.059
intentions are.
My-my hope is...

04:37.102 --> 04:39.061
Maybe you should have asked
before you raced.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.717
Trust me, you, uh, you don't
want me asking the Davidsons

04:42.760 --> 04:44.588
for anything on your behalf.

04:44.632 --> 04:47.287
- He just had to turn around.
- Sorry?

04:47.330 --> 04:48.679
I-I didn't...

04:48.723 --> 04:50.725
- I didn't catch that, Leon.
- Dan Miller.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.204
We're all in this mess
because you just

04:52.248 --> 04:53.815
had to turn around
and be the bigger man.

04:53.858 --> 04:57.035
Do you feel like the
bigger man now, Cordell?

05:00.517 --> 05:03.303
My family will not rest

05:03.346 --> 05:04.782
until y'all are

05:04.826 --> 05:07.394
all squared away somewhere.
Okay?

05:07.437 --> 05:09.483
That's a promise. I'll just...

05:10.527 --> 05:12.703
I don't know where yet.

05:12.747 --> 05:15.750
Well, by all means...
take your time.

05:17.055 --> 05:18.492
<i>Bonham Walker</i>

05:18.535 --> 05:20.145
is guilty, Your Honor.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.451
He perpetrateda fraud.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.453
And not just against my family,

05:23.497 --> 05:25.020
but the people of this city.

05:25.063 --> 05:27.631
25 years.

05:27.675 --> 05:30.808
The Walker family
have built a business,

05:30.852 --> 05:32.941
a legacy, on
their good name.

05:32.984 --> 05:36.423
In the coming weeks, we will
lay out witness testimony,

05:36.466 --> 05:39.948
financial transactions
and evidence that prove

05:39.991 --> 05:42.167
the defendant
was inside the barn

05:42.211 --> 05:44.039
at the time
of Mr. Davidson's

05:44.082 --> 05:45.693
murder, struck him

05:45.736 --> 05:47.390
in the head with a lantern,

05:47.434 --> 05:48.913
and then buried
his murder weapon

05:48.957 --> 05:50.524
so that his crimes
could never be unearthed.

05:50.567 --> 05:51.699
Well, I am sorry,

05:51.742 --> 05:53.657
Mr. Walker,

05:53.701 --> 05:56.834
but your 25-year fraud is over.

06:00.316 --> 06:02.362
Well, that was a remarkable
string of fiction

06:02.405 --> 06:04.494
about everything other than
why we're here, Madam D.A.,

06:04.538 --> 06:07.976
Thank you so much for that.
Your Honor, this is very simple.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.891
A 68-year-old
man has been

06:09.934 --> 06:12.459
charged on very thin evidence.

06:12.502 --> 06:13.982
This man has no priors.

06:14.025 --> 06:16.158
Not only is he innocent,
but he's definitely

06:16.201 --> 06:17.855
- not a flight risk.
- He's not a flight risk?

06:17.899 --> 06:19.857
He was just out destroying
evidence last week.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.207
He tossed out
a 25-year-old lantern.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.861
Can we please
stay on planet Earth?

06:23.905 --> 06:26.081
Of course, of course.
He was just casually

06:26.124 --> 06:27.735
burying his own murder weapon.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.432
Your Honor, if the
Defense is not able

06:29.476 --> 06:30.607
to finish a statement...

06:30.651 --> 06:31.869
Mr. Walker is correct.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.567
D.A. Davidson Miller...

06:33.610 --> 06:35.307
- tighten it up.
- Yes, sir.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.179
Thank you, Your Honor.

06:37.222 --> 06:38.920
You know what,
while we're at it,

06:38.963 --> 06:41.531
why don't we discuss this
very wild conflict of interest?

06:41.575 --> 06:43.359
If the D.A. won't proactively

06:43.403 --> 06:44.752
recuse herself,

06:44.795 --> 06:46.449
then the Defense will be filing

06:46.493 --> 06:48.016
a motion for disqualification.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.800
Can the bench please

06:49.844 --> 06:51.846
- step in here?
There is no state law that

06:51.889 --> 06:53.500
I don't want to hear it.

06:53.543 --> 06:56.938
You're not gonna prosecute your
own father's murder, Madam D.A.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.853
The Defense's motion
is granted.

06:58.896 --> 07:01.899
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- This'll be your last hearing
on this matter.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.510
Now, on the matter of bail.

07:03.553 --> 07:06.121
Given the previous attempts

07:06.164 --> 07:08.471
at destruction of evidence,

07:08.515 --> 07:10.430
bail is denied.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.217
Son.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.656
Thank you.

08:04.396 --> 08:06.790
Well, ain't this this
the horseshoe on the other foot.

08:07.617 --> 08:10.141
Bet you've been in this room
hundreds of times.

08:10.185 --> 08:12.274
Never like this.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.755
Daddy, y-you're not gonna be
in here for long,

08:14.798 --> 08:16.321
- you hear me?
- Now, don't

08:16.365 --> 08:19.150
blow sunshine up my ass.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.761
How'd it go
with the ranch hands?

08:24.547 --> 08:27.202
The-the bunkhouse is behind you.

08:29.291 --> 08:33.338
Uh, uh, a few... holdouts. Uh...

08:33.382 --> 08:35.297
That's how it's gonna be,
you know.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.560
So, you need to steel yourself.
Hang tough.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.957
Hey. Hey. Oh.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.219
You okay?

08:44.262 --> 08:45.829
I'm fine. How are you?

08:45.873 --> 08:49.050
Oh, I'm fine, darling.
I'm fine. Mm.

08:49.093 --> 08:51.052
So, where we at?

08:51.095 --> 08:53.924
I'm required to
tell you, by law, that

08:53.968 --> 08:56.448
the D.A.'s office
has offered you a plea deal.

08:56.492 --> 08:57.928
Ten years.

08:57.972 --> 09:00.801
Seven, with
good behavior.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.803
You would plead guilty

09:02.846 --> 09:04.500
- and admit to the murder.
- Well,

09:04.544 --> 09:06.807
I'm sure you told Denise exactly
where she could put that.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.113
In more lawyer-
appropriate terms,

09:09.157 --> 09:11.115
- I did, yeah.
- So, ten years

09:11.159 --> 09:13.161
if I admit to murder.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.205
Yeah.

09:16.468 --> 09:17.948
I'm not a guilty man, son.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.211
I know that. We know that.

09:20.255 --> 09:22.562
I don't think Denise is gonna
take your word, though.

09:23.824 --> 09:24.999
Well, speak up, Cordell.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.609
You and Cassie
been looking into

09:26.653 --> 09:28.306
Marv's murder.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.873
Can we beat this?

09:33.703 --> 09:35.400
Uh...

09:36.967 --> 09:37.968
Well, I-I think

09:38.012 --> 09:39.622
I said I would win the race,

09:39.666 --> 09:41.798
and look where that got us,

09:41.842 --> 09:44.540
so I don't-I don't think
I'm the guy to-to really...

09:44.584 --> 09:46.324
That wasn't my question.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.982
I think we, uh...

09:53.984 --> 09:55.464
I think we fight.

09:55.507 --> 09:56.813
I think we win.

09:57.988 --> 10:00.034
Well, there's
that sunshine again.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.603
Okay.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.039
So...

10:06.780 --> 10:08.433
...you tell her where she can

10:08.477 --> 10:10.479
put it, Liam.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.524
<i>Perez. </i>
<i>Walk with me real quick, please.</i>

10:12.568 --> 10:14.570
- What's up, Cap?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.311
D.A.'s been lobbying hard,

10:16.354 --> 10:18.139
winning over
stars and Stetsons.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.358
Let me guess--
Bonham's bail hearing

10:20.402 --> 10:23.492
didn't exactly help
the counter-offensive?

10:23.535 --> 10:25.276
Davidson knows they got a
lot of carrots and sticks

10:25.320 --> 10:27.365
at her disposal
to help people

10:27.409 --> 10:30.412
- see it her way, you know?
- Cowards.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.154
I don't disagree. I just, uh...

10:34.938 --> 10:36.679
I hear the violins,
I see the iceberg,

10:36.723 --> 10:37.941
and there are not
enough life rafts.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.901
But you should get one.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.729
You just got here--
this isn't your fight.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.078
Maybe. Walker

10:44.121 --> 10:45.470
asked me to look into
Marv's case.

10:45.514 --> 10:46.950
I believe Bonham is innocent.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.126
And I think you do, too.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.912
So, if you
don't mind,

10:51.955 --> 10:54.828
I would like to go down
with your ship, Captain.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.873
All right.
Just so we're clear,

10:56.917 --> 10:59.484
this wasn't, like,
- a test or anything.
- Mm.

10:59.528 --> 11:02.183
No. Of course not.
But if it was?

11:02.226 --> 11:03.097
It wasn't.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.968
Yeah. But if it was?

11:05.012 --> 11:06.883
Then you would have passed.

11:06.927 --> 11:09.190
Okay? Do me a favor--

11:09.233 --> 11:10.757
don't ever wink again.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.107
Yeah. Cool. Got it.
Now, can we chat for real?

11:13.150 --> 11:16.240
Because I think I have the
beat on Marv's true killer.

11:16.284 --> 11:18.112
Why didn't you start with that?

11:18.155 --> 11:19.679
'Cause you wanted
to do the test thing.

11:30.733 --> 11:33.040
Oh!

11:33.083 --> 11:35.303
Can you please
be more careful, all right?

11:35.346 --> 11:36.304
Gramps is gonna get pissed.

11:37.348 --> 11:39.307
You haven't said a word to me
all morning, and now

11:39.350 --> 11:41.788
- you're worried about horseshoes?
- Yeah, what's there to say?

11:41.831 --> 11:44.138
I don't know-- maybe,
"I'm sorry, Stella"?

11:44.181 --> 11:45.966
"I know I've been
acting like a jackass

11:46.009 --> 11:48.708
all morning, Stella, but..."Wait, wait, "I-I'm sorry"?

11:48.751 --> 11:50.666
No, this is happening
to me too, you know?

11:50.710 --> 11:51.885
You know what?

11:53.582 --> 11:55.018
- Forget it.
- No, no, no.

11:55.062 --> 11:56.411
No, I want to know.
I mean, are you seriously

11:56.454 --> 11:57.717
blaming me for Grandpa?

11:57.760 --> 11:59.588
Fine. Yes.

11:59.631 --> 12:02.330
You just had to go and climb
that barn, didn't you? You just

12:02.373 --> 12:04.201
had to impress Faye.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.769
You do realize that she only
acts like she likes you

12:06.813 --> 12:08.118
half the of the time, right?

12:08.162 --> 12:09.337
It's not just half the time.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.036
What?

12:13.080 --> 12:15.517
Look, Faye doesn't like me
any of the time.

12:15.560 --> 12:18.215
All right?
She broke up with me.

12:19.216 --> 12:20.827
- Did she say why?
- Yeah, it's-it's...

12:20.870 --> 12:22.567
it's too much drama, Stella.

12:22.611 --> 12:25.657
Too many lanterns.
It's not just about court.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.398
Plus, I think
everyone at school thinks

12:27.442 --> 12:29.661
Gramps did this too.

12:29.705 --> 12:32.012
It's real nice to know
whose fault you think it is.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.892
I'm going to HQ.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.198
Wait, just hold on, hold on.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.330
- What?
- What you said to Dad in there

12:46.374 --> 12:48.811
about the race. Okay?

12:48.855 --> 12:50.378
Of course you had to go back.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.249
You're a Ranger--
you save lives for a living.

12:52.293 --> 12:55.339
Okay? And as much as I
wanted Dan to suffer out there,

12:55.383 --> 12:57.907
you wouldn't want that
on your conscience.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.735
The guilt.
You-you would feel...

12:59.779 --> 13:01.998
I would feel like we still
had a roof over our heads.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.784
I'd feel like y'all had
a roof over your heads,

13:04.827 --> 13:06.437
like my kids would have
a roof over their heads.

13:06.481 --> 13:09.136
But can we not talk
about that right now?

13:09.179 --> 13:11.181
Let's-let's stay
- focused on Dad, okay?
- Yeah.

13:11.225 --> 13:12.574
Cordell's right.
Especially because

13:12.617 --> 13:14.315
there's something
the two of you don't know

13:14.358 --> 13:15.925
about the night of the fire.

13:15.969 --> 13:17.492
Okay. Uh,

13:17.535 --> 13:19.059
what?

13:19.102 --> 13:20.582
You boys remember
hearing anything

13:20.625 --> 13:22.105
about the Davidson child--

13:22.149 --> 13:24.194
the one that died
just after birth?

13:24.238 --> 13:26.327
Uh... yeah,
bit-bits and pieces.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.895
- Yeah.
- Well, the night before

13:28.938 --> 13:30.853
the barn fire, Marv came to me.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.856
And he told me...

13:33.900 --> 13:35.249
the child lived.

13:35.292 --> 13:37.207
Gale had no idea.

13:37.251 --> 13:38.992
And I-I think she...

13:40.384 --> 13:42.604
I think she still has no idea.
But we do know

13:42.647 --> 13:44.780
that Marv challenged your father

13:44.824 --> 13:46.869
to a horse race.
And that he was desperate

13:46.913 --> 13:50.307
for the money.
And I can't help but feel that

13:50.351 --> 13:52.353
those the two events are linked.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.355
And I ju-I just don't know how.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.791
- You knew that this whole time?
- Wait,

13:55.835 --> 13:57.706
that's how you're gonna
react to this?

13:57.749 --> 13:59.621
Okay, I'm sorry, Liam, our-our
father is behind bars right now

13:59.664 --> 14:02.450
and this information could help
exonerate him. If Marv's death

14:02.493 --> 14:05.888
and-and financial troubles are
linked, that could prove motive.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.716
It's also only a theory.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.761
O-Okay, well, fine.
Are there any other theories

14:09.805 --> 14:11.894
you or you care to share
with me right now?

14:11.938 --> 14:12.939
Please.

14:12.982 --> 14:13.853
I know this is hard for you

14:13.896 --> 14:15.202
to understand, but this was not

14:15.245 --> 14:16.594
my secret to tell.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.335
And I couldn't
make any sense out of it

14:18.379 --> 14:20.816
until after your father
was arrested.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.906
So judge me or don't,
it's your choice. But use it.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.474
And find the man that
really murdered Marv Davidson.

14:37.137 --> 14:39.574
Okay, let's see...

14:40.531 --> 14:41.924
- Hey. Cass.
- Hey.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.927
Hey there. Uh...

14:44.971 --> 14:46.668
hey, there are about, uh...

14:46.711 --> 14:48.496
four or five empty desks.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.106
Wh-Why are you at mine?

14:50.150 --> 14:51.194
Hey.

14:51.238 --> 14:52.935
How's the family holding up?

14:52.979 --> 14:54.415
Cap. They, uh,

14:54.458 --> 14:56.939
um...
yeah, been better.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.114
However,

14:58.158 --> 14:59.594
I-I think
I might have something

14:59.637 --> 15:01.465
to help at least
one of them.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.859
Good, so do we.
Or so does Cassie.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.254
Okay. So, short story first.

15:07.297 --> 15:09.517
I understand we have
a mutual friend.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.041
- Agent Tessa Graves.
- Did she think
you were corrupt too?

15:12.085 --> 15:13.434
Yeah, she mentioned you might

15:13.477 --> 15:15.001
still have that
stuck in your craw.

15:15.044 --> 15:18.526
Anyway, we did a RICO task
force. I was the rookie,

15:18.569 --> 15:20.484
which meant I was
on forensic accounting.

15:20.528 --> 15:21.616
- Sure.
- So...

15:21.659 --> 15:22.965
Perez followed
the money.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.401
Turns out that
Marv spent a decade

15:24.445 --> 15:25.794
paying one ranch hand
a monthly stipend.

15:25.837 --> 15:28.623
A-a rancher
paying a-a ranch hand--

15:28.666 --> 15:30.668
that's-that's
- your big break?
- Okay, wait for it.

15:30.712 --> 15:33.628
His name's Nate Smith. He hadn't
worked for Marv in 11 years.

15:33.671 --> 15:35.412
We think that Nate

15:35.456 --> 15:37.806
found out about
Marv's questionable

15:37.849 --> 15:39.895
business practices,
put the squeeze on his boss.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.941
Payments stopped
three months later,

15:41.984 --> 15:43.551
right before Marv was murdered.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.988
The timing
begs a lot of questions.

15:46.032 --> 15:49.296
I don't think it was
questionable business practices.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.211
- What makes you say that?
- Let's just say

15:51.254 --> 15:53.387
my parents
keep too many secrets.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.475
But, yeah, we'll-we'll
check it out.

15:54.518 --> 15:55.867
Come on, Cass.

15:55.911 --> 15:56.868
I'll explain everything
on the way.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.087
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.436
- Keep me in the loop.
- Yes, sir.

16:11.231 --> 16:13.320
- Nate Smith!
- Cordell Walker.

16:13.363 --> 16:16.279
- Yes, sir.
- Saw about your dad on the news.

16:16.323 --> 16:17.628
Must be a

16:17.672 --> 16:20.109
hell of a time
up at Walker Ranch.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.545
Yeah, well, you know, don't

16:21.589 --> 16:23.156
believe everything
you see, Nate.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.853
Uh, we're-we're
hanging in there.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.376
You here about
your ranch hands?

16:26.420 --> 16:28.161
You send 'em my way,
I'll take care of 'em.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.380
- That's, uh, awful
kind of you, Nate,

16:30.424 --> 16:32.165
but, uh...

16:32.208 --> 16:35.429
But this ain't about
gainful employment?

16:35.472 --> 16:38.084
- No, sir.
- We were hoping you could detail

16:38.127 --> 16:41.696
some payments between March
of '86 and the end of '95.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.785
And what they were really for.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.571
Ooh, should've seen
that one coming.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.486
We're just turning
over every rock.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.271
Coming around
asking about monthly payments.

16:51.314 --> 16:52.924
No, I think you heard
the same rumors

16:52.968 --> 16:54.535
I used to.

16:54.578 --> 16:56.232
Marv's second child, right?

16:56.276 --> 16:59.061
The one that secretly made it?
Just rumors.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.323
Okay, well, we have
it on good authority

17:00.367 --> 17:01.324
that they're-
they're not...

17:01.368 --> 17:03.587
- just rumors.
- I had it

17:03.631 --> 17:05.415
as bunkhouse banter.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.461
And those payments?
Just rent.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.028
Cattle he didn't have room for.

17:09.071 --> 17:12.074
That certainly
clears up our confusion.

17:12.118 --> 17:15.686
We'll just sync up with Marv's
estate on the rent agreement,

17:15.730 --> 17:17.297
and I'm sure they have it.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.429
Sorry I couldn't be more help.

17:19.473 --> 17:22.302
Be seeing you, Cordell.
Ranger.

17:22.345 --> 17:25.000
Hey, Nate, uh, you know,
I'm gonna-I'm gonna

17:25.044 --> 17:28.612
need you to-to wipe that smile
off your face. Just rent?

17:29.526 --> 17:31.050
Come on, now.
We're being serious.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.704
Excuse me, son?

17:33.748 --> 17:34.792
You know what I'm thinking?

17:34.836 --> 17:36.925
I'm thinking that, uh,

17:36.968 --> 17:38.361
it was you

17:38.405 --> 17:40.363
who killed Marv Davidson.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.626
And I think right now
you're figuring out that

17:42.670 --> 17:45.325
25 years of lies
is finally catching up with you.

17:45.368 --> 17:46.500
Is that right?

17:46.543 --> 17:48.676
I told you to stop smiling.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.461
I think you took that
bunkhouse banter

17:51.505 --> 17:54.508
straight to the bank.
You blackmailed Marv Davidson

17:54.551 --> 17:56.814
over the existence
of that child.

17:56.858 --> 17:59.121
And then when Marv turned
the spigot off, you decided

17:59.165 --> 18:02.298
you were gonna get paid
one way the other. Right?

18:02.342 --> 18:04.648
Marv disregarded a child,

18:04.692 --> 18:06.259
and you were okay to go along

18:06.302 --> 18:08.783
with it as long as
you were made whole.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.654
Am I right?

18:10.698 --> 18:11.960
Your daddy

18:12.003 --> 18:15.311
offered me
a job once.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.226
I turned him down.

18:17.270 --> 18:21.100
Seemed like there's something
off about you Walkers.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.319
Something
two-faced.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.712
I'm glad this
town finally

18:24.755 --> 18:27.149
gets to see you for

18:27.193 --> 18:29.108
criminals.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.373
Don't come back
without a warrant.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.522
I don't want to hear it, all
right? I don't need to hear it.

18:52.566 --> 18:55.960
I don't need you to say it.
I know, okay? I...

18:56.004 --> 18:57.745
- I stepped in it.
- Yeah, sorry--

18:57.788 --> 18:59.268
what was that?
I can't hear you over the sound

18:59.312 --> 19:01.444
- of our blown lead.
- All I could see

19:01.488 --> 19:03.490
was red, okay?
All I could see was-was my dad

19:03.533 --> 19:06.101
and-and sand slipping

19:06.145 --> 19:08.843
through our fingers.
And-and Dan in the dirt.

19:08.886 --> 19:12.281
And I... I forced it.

19:12.325 --> 19:13.978
Okay? I'll admit it.
I forced it.

19:14.022 --> 19:16.067
You happy?

19:20.681 --> 19:22.770
eat.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.599
- What?
- I always think
better with food. Eat.

19:29.255 --> 19:33.128
next time
your gut feels broke,

19:33.172 --> 19:36.175
maybe tell me before
we meet the murder suspect.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.828
Okay, my gut is fine.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.178
Oh, right, yeah.
'Cause this

19:39.221 --> 19:41.223
isn't all a diatribe
about self-doubt.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.835
We're partners.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.924
When you're off, I can be on.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.231
I just... I-I need

19:49.275 --> 19:51.407
to know when you're...You need... you need
to know I'm off.

19:51.451 --> 19:52.278
Yes.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.976
Yeah, I get it.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.847
I'm not gonna pretend
to know what it feels like

19:56.891 --> 19:58.893
to have a father behind bars.

20:00.460 --> 20:03.724
But I do know the man
I heard about in that race.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.596
And he is someone
I'm proud to call partner.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.382
And I don't think
you actually regret

20:09.425 --> 20:12.428
any of your choices
from that day.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.038
Just the outcome.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.564
Don't really know
how to separate the two.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.439
Hey, I'm gonna...

20:23.483 --> 20:25.441
take a sec. I-I

20:25.485 --> 20:28.792
just need to, uh, um...
need to

20:28.836 --> 20:31.012
finish packing up the ranch

20:31.055 --> 20:32.274
and, uh,

20:32.318 --> 20:34.320
get my head on straight.
Uh...

20:34.363 --> 20:37.410
I'll meet you back at HQ, yeah?

20:37.453 --> 20:39.586
Sounds good.

20:39.629 --> 20:40.935
Hey.

20:40.978 --> 20:43.198
We can crack
this thing, partner.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.026
Yeah. Uh, here's hoping.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.325
Hey.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.196
- You're here.
- Yeah.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.068
You're early.
It's not time yet.

21:27.111 --> 21:28.417
I just thought
y'all were finished.

21:28.461 --> 21:31.377
Well, we're obviously
not finished.

21:31.420 --> 21:32.943
But I'll... I'm
working on it.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.902
I'll be out soon enough.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.383
Um...

21:37.426 --> 21:39.167
Walker, I got to be
straight with you.

21:39.210 --> 21:42.779
Bonham needs to take that deal.
It's fair, uh, considering...

21:42.823 --> 21:45.129
We've retained counsel.
- Thank you.
- What you have is another

21:45.173 --> 21:46.957
- conflict of interest.
- Says the woman

21:47.001 --> 21:50.004
who was disqualified
by a judge today.

21:50.047 --> 21:52.311
That doesn't mean
I don't hear things.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.095
I mean, do you really think
I didn't have my team

21:54.138 --> 21:56.663
run down the Nate Smith theory?

21:56.706 --> 21:58.186
Do you think I would be sloppy

21:58.229 --> 22:01.015
with my own father's
investigation? Or yours?

22:01.058 --> 22:03.234
So that's the real reason
for this house call--

22:03.278 --> 22:05.324
you're-you're... you're worried
about my partner and me

22:05.367 --> 22:06.803
double-checking your work.

22:07.848 --> 22:10.416
I'm worried about you nuking
someone else's career.

22:10.459 --> 22:12.069
First your brother. Now Perez.

22:13.114 --> 22:15.856
Yeah, respectfully,
don't bring Cassie into this.

22:15.899 --> 22:18.293
You're the one that brought her
into it. Son of the accused?

22:18.337 --> 22:19.599
To a grand jury, that's just

22:19.642 --> 22:21.165
gonna look like
witness tampering.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.299
Well, it's good to know where
the D.A.'s office stands.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.214
Anything else?

22:28.869 --> 22:30.392
Cordi.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.307
How did we get here?

22:32.351 --> 22:34.265
I mean, I thought we were gonna

22:34.309 --> 22:37.312
- be the ones to stop the feud.
- Yeah,

22:37.356 --> 22:40.271
well... guess we turned
out to be the exact people

22:40.315 --> 22:42.883
our parents told us
we would be. Go figure.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.973
Yeah. All right.

22:57.071 --> 22:59.595
Little young. But
if you're looking for

22:59.639 --> 23:01.075
some happy hour therapy,

23:01.118 --> 23:04.383
I mean...I appreciate it, but

23:04.426 --> 23:05.384
these problems may be
bigger than the bar.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.343
You're 15.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.910
I'm old enough
to destroy a family.

23:09.953 --> 23:13.435
Okay. Well, that sounds like
the root beer talking.

23:13.479 --> 23:15.350
No, it's just the, uh,
older sister.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.570
You know,
Stella says that

23:17.613 --> 23:18.832
Gramps is being
taken away because

23:18.875 --> 23:20.529
I brought the lantern home.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.575
Do you really believe that?
I mean,

23:22.618 --> 23:25.839
you don't think she just had
a rough day, took it out on you?

23:25.882 --> 23:29.451
You know the butterfly effect?

23:29.495 --> 23:31.235
Small events
ripple into large outcomes.

23:31.279 --> 23:34.543
Yeah. I'm-I'm aware.
Go on.

23:34.587 --> 23:35.588
So, like, if I hadn't
found that lantern

23:35.631 --> 23:37.154
and Gramps never buries it,

23:37.198 --> 23:39.243
and the judge never blocks bail.

23:39.287 --> 23:41.115
Yeah, I don't think
- it works that way.
- I don't know, it sounds like

23:41.158 --> 23:43.247
pretty serious physics
- on the Internet.
- Well, it always does.

23:44.858 --> 23:47.556
there's about 25 years

23:47.600 --> 23:50.341
that precede your ripple.

23:50.385 --> 23:52.866
I get it. You're worried
about your grandpa.

23:52.909 --> 23:54.476
Aren't we all?

23:54.520 --> 23:56.870
Augie, everyone
is spiraling right now.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.959
So, why don't we talk about

23:59.002 --> 24:01.657
a little theory that my dad

24:01.701 --> 24:04.399
used to call "one good thing."

24:04.443 --> 24:07.097
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

24:07.141 --> 24:09.273
So, I-I just had a visit
from our D.A.

24:09.317 --> 24:10.666
You good? You sound spooked.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.146
I'm more worried about you.

24:12.189 --> 24:14.453
Listen, Denise mentioned

24:14.496 --> 24:17.630
witness tampering.
Even grand jury.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.806
Just wanted
to shoot you straight.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.329
Flying under
the Walker banner right now

24:21.372 --> 24:25.681
might, uh...
might be a little toxic.

24:25.725 --> 24:26.987
Just right now?

24:27.030 --> 24:29.555
I know coming back
to the Rangers

24:29.598 --> 24:32.209
was-was a-a difficult choice,

24:32.253 --> 24:33.776
and I-I... I just don't...

24:33.820 --> 24:36.866
I don't want to
make it any harder.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.172
Damn, she did spook you.

24:38.215 --> 24:39.390
I don't think your instincts

24:39.434 --> 24:41.088
were that off, here, Hoss.

24:41.131 --> 24:44.134
I think they put the fear of God
into our prime suspect.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.876
Our prime su...
Wait, Nate Smith?

24:46.920 --> 24:49.531
Wait... did he do something?

24:49.575 --> 24:51.359
After your late-game ejection,

24:51.402 --> 24:54.231
I hung back,
surveilled his place.

24:54.275 --> 24:55.842
Our innocent rancher--

24:55.885 --> 24:58.714
he packed up his luggage
and swung by the bank.

24:58.758 --> 25:00.716
Looks like
getting out of town to me.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.152
Okay, wh-where are you now?

25:02.196 --> 25:03.632
You're not gonna believe this,

25:03.676 --> 25:05.373
but I'm at The Side Step.

25:05.416 --> 25:06.853
What the hell is

25:06.896 --> 25:08.637
Nate Smith doing there?

25:08.681 --> 25:12.206
I don't know.
But toss that raft

25:12.249 --> 25:13.642
and bring some hell
down here.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.165
Yes, ma'am.

25:36.404 --> 25:37.884
Geraldine Broussard.

25:37.927 --> 25:39.625
Hi.

25:41.017 --> 25:42.584
You don't remember me?

25:42.628 --> 25:44.151
Uh...

25:44.194 --> 25:45.674
It's-it's Nathaniel.

25:45.718 --> 25:47.154
Nate Smith.

25:48.851 --> 25:50.113
Nope, sorry.

25:50.157 --> 25:52.681
I haven't seen you
since you was a kid.

25:52.725 --> 25:55.423
Um...
Yeah, who-who are you?

25:55.466 --> 25:57.381
I'm a friend of your dad's.

25:57.425 --> 25:59.166
Friend of Frank.

25:59.209 --> 26:02.473
Uh... I helped

26:02.517 --> 26:04.475
pay for your heart surgery,
in a way.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.001
Clear the bar. Texas Rangers!

26:08.044 --> 26:09.655
- Everybody out!
- Nate,

26:09.698 --> 26:11.657
- what are you doing here?
- Walker, do you know this guy?

26:11.700 --> 26:15.269
He's a... a person of interest
in the Marv Davidson case.

26:15.312 --> 26:19.012
This isn't just about Marv.
It's about Bonham.

26:20.013 --> 26:21.449
And her.

26:21.492 --> 26:23.669
Okay. I'll
- ask again.
- What?

26:23.712 --> 26:25.409
What are you doing here?

26:25.453 --> 26:28.108
All right, your instincts were
right, back at the ranch.

26:28.151 --> 26:31.981
But you j... you just, you got
it all twisted in the end.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.201
But...

26:34.244 --> 26:37.160
Bonham is a good man.

26:37.204 --> 26:40.033
Now, he don't deserve
what's happening to him.

26:41.164 --> 26:43.123
And she needs
to hear this from me.

26:43.166 --> 26:44.341
Hear what?

26:48.476 --> 26:51.479
Can I have this conversation
with Geri in private, please?

26:51.522 --> 26:54.482
No, if this is about Bonham,
then whatever you tell me,

26:54.525 --> 26:55.918
- he can hear it too.
- All clear.

26:58.355 --> 26:59.879
All right.

27:01.228 --> 27:02.664
If you don't

27:02.708 --> 27:04.623
remember me, do you

27:04.666 --> 27:06.755
remember a pink music box?

27:08.278 --> 27:10.585
<i>Uh, yes. My-my father</i>

27:10.629 --> 27:13.632
<i>gave me one when we came</i>
<i>to Austin for the first time.</i>

27:13.675 --> 27:15.677
<i>He bought it for you</i>
<i>when you were staying with me</i>

27:15.721 --> 27:18.027
<i> in Brushy Creek. He said it-it</i>

27:18.071 --> 27:20.160
- helped you sleep.
- Yeah, I-I remember.

27:20.203 --> 27:22.945
Okay, Nate...

27:22.989 --> 27:24.773
how do you
really know Frank?

27:24.817 --> 27:28.429
I used to work up in OKC a lot.
And we became friends.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.432
And Geri got sick,
so she was

27:31.475 --> 27:34.740
spending a lot of time
with specialists in Austin.

27:34.783 --> 27:38.700
I'd-I'd go with your dad
a lot to the hospital.

27:38.744 --> 27:41.660
It was near a duck pond.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.574
It's by a creek.

27:43.618 --> 27:45.620
<i>Austin General had</i>
<i>this new treatment,</i>

27:45.664 --> 27:47.578
<i>but Frank couldn't afford it.</i>

27:47.622 --> 27:49.580
<i> They were gonna discharge you,</i>

27:49.624 --> 27:52.758
<i>and Frank came to me</i>
<i>with this idea.</i>

27:52.801 --> 27:54.629
A robbery.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.457
N... Uh, no.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.285
Okay,

27:58.328 --> 27:59.503
that's...

27:59.547 --> 28:01.157
that's not my father.

28:01.201 --> 28:03.203
He wouldn't-he wouldn't do that.

28:03.246 --> 28:05.640
Oh, I agree, but-but
he was-he was desperate.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.424
- Who were you gonna rob?
- Marv.

28:07.468 --> 28:09.035
Frank and I used to work for him

28:09.078 --> 28:11.124
before he moved up to OKC.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.213
Marv was always
living high on the hog,

28:13.256 --> 28:14.649
but shorting his employees,

28:14.693 --> 28:17.652
so Frank asked him
for his back pay to help

28:17.696 --> 28:19.654
cover the surgery.

28:19.698 --> 28:23.397
Marv told him to pound sand.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.355
<i>But...</i>

28:25.399 --> 28:28.228
<i>I knew where</i>
<i>Marv hid his money.</i>

28:40.980 --> 28:43.678
<i>Hell, all we had to do was</i>

28:43.722 --> 28:47.377
<i>go up to... to Hill Country,</i>

28:47.421 --> 28:50.859
<i>take the money out of a slick</i>

28:50.903 --> 28:53.296
<i>that Marv kept in his barn.</i>

28:53.340 --> 28:55.037
<i>Not all of it, mind you. Just...</i>

28:55.081 --> 28:57.344
<i>just enough.</i>

28:58.345 --> 28:59.694
Got it.

29:02.871 --> 29:03.916
Right there.

29:07.049 --> 29:08.485
Come on, Frank,
hurry up.

29:08.529 --> 29:11.793
<i>We were just there</i>
<i>for the money.</i>

29:11.837 --> 29:13.969
<i>But then I saw smoke</i>
<i>creep in under the door.</i>

29:14.013 --> 29:16.755
We got to go. We've
got enough, right there.

29:24.893 --> 29:26.590
<i>But the barn caught fire,</i>

29:26.634 --> 29:28.810
<i>and it was</i>
<i>getting out of control.</i>

29:28.854 --> 29:31.595
Frank, the window!

29:39.647 --> 29:41.301
<i>We split up.</i>

29:43.607 --> 29:44.913
<i>Smoke got to me,</i>

29:44.957 --> 29:47.960
and... I think I passed out.

29:49.439 --> 29:50.832
When I come to...

29:55.706 --> 29:57.796
<i>...I see Bonham,</i>

29:57.839 --> 29:59.885
<i>and he's got</i>
<i>this crazy look in his eye.</i>

29:59.928 --> 30:02.061
<i>He was trying to save a life.</i>

30:02.104 --> 30:03.584
<i>Not take one.</i>

30:11.374 --> 30:13.420
- What happened, Frank?
- It's taken care of.

30:14.290 --> 30:15.814
The hell you mean?

30:16.858 --> 30:18.904
And Marv

30:18.947 --> 30:21.254
won't be a problem
ever again.

30:21.297 --> 30:23.343
Frank came back
with the money...

30:25.824 --> 30:27.826
...and Marv Davidson was dead.

30:30.698 --> 30:33.919
He caught him in the act, Geri.
I'm sorry.

30:33.962 --> 30:36.573
I d...

30:36.617 --> 30:38.445
Um...

30:38.488 --> 30:40.534
I-I guess
I'm not understanding--

30:40.577 --> 30:44.364
why-why would my father
kill someone

30:44.407 --> 30:47.715
to pay for my-for my treatments?

30:49.282 --> 30:50.892
Uh, this-this

30:50.936 --> 30:53.242
doesn't... this doesn't
make any sense.

30:53.286 --> 30:55.070
No.
I'm-I'm...

30:55.114 --> 30:57.507
I'm sorry, but you're lying.

30:57.551 --> 30:58.769
Wish I was.

30:58.813 --> 31:01.207
Okay, Nate,
those payments...

31:03.557 --> 31:05.341
...they weren't hush money.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.781
They were, uh...

31:12.696 --> 31:13.915
...they were child support.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.525
What?

31:15.569 --> 31:18.659
And, uh,
and-and you...

31:19.834 --> 31:21.836
...you were the middle man

31:21.880 --> 31:24.926
between Marv and Frank, right?

31:24.970 --> 31:26.232
For a long time.

31:26.275 --> 31:28.495
- Too long.
- What are you talking about?

31:28.538 --> 31:30.149
Cordi.

31:30.192 --> 31:31.498
Hush money?

31:31.541 --> 31:32.803
Child support?

31:32.847 --> 31:34.588
There is
no one alive

31:34.631 --> 31:37.112
who can even speak to this.

31:37.156 --> 31:40.159
That's not entirely true, Ger.
Uh...

31:40.202 --> 31:41.987
- Maybe we should... hang back?
- No.

31:42.030 --> 31:45.033
No, no, no, no.
My, uh, my-my...

31:45.077 --> 31:47.949
my gut is telling me something,
and, um...

31:47.993 --> 31:49.429
- What?
- I-I think

31:49.472 --> 31:52.432
we should get Abby here.
You know?

31:52.475 --> 31:54.913
He's accusing
my father of murder.

31:54.956 --> 31:57.524
- Are you hearing that?
- Yeah...

31:57.567 --> 31:59.830
Why would he murder
some random man?

31:59.874 --> 32:01.528
Ger, Ger,

32:01.571 --> 32:02.746
M-Mar...

32:02.790 --> 32:04.009
Marv, uh,

32:04.052 --> 32:06.925
w-wasn't random.

32:11.059 --> 32:12.843
Marv Davidson is, uh...

32:12.887 --> 32:13.888
What?

32:13.932 --> 32:15.672
...is your father.

32:15.716 --> 32:17.631
- What?!
- He's your birth father.

32:17.674 --> 32:19.067
No.

32:19.111 --> 32:20.634
Are you hearing yourself?

32:20.677 --> 32:22.853
Okay, listen...Are you hearing

32:22.897 --> 32:24.855
- what you're saying?
- Okay, before Marv died,

32:24.899 --> 32:26.857
he-he... he went
to my mom, okay?

32:26.901 --> 32:29.164
And he told her...

32:29.208 --> 32:31.210
he had a child out there.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.515
- Stop.
- A child

32:32.559 --> 32:35.344
everyone thought was dead.

32:35.388 --> 32:38.434
But who wasn't dead.
Okay? Who-who...

32:39.435 --> 32:41.481
...who, uh, who isn't.

32:42.612 --> 32:45.354
Because I am...

32:45.398 --> 32:47.313
looking at her right now.

32:48.662 --> 32:51.708
I am not
Marv Davidson's daughter.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.972
Yeah.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.408
Pretty sure you are, Geri.

32:55.451 --> 32:58.193
Just as much
as you're Frank's.

32:58.237 --> 33:00.456
Hey.S... S...

33:00.500 --> 33:01.805
Just...

33:01.849 --> 33:03.982
I can't. I'm sorry, I c-I c...

33:04.025 --> 33:06.027
I cannot be here right now.

33:20.955 --> 33:24.480
Ger. Hey.

33:24.524 --> 33:26.004
Hey.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.754
Well... looks like

33:37.798 --> 33:40.018
you found your one good thing.

33:43.891 --> 33:45.632
Hey.
That man's testimony

33:45.675 --> 33:47.895
is gonna bring your daddy home.

33:47.938 --> 33:49.549
Not like this.

33:49.592 --> 33:52.073
Geri, I-I never wanted

33:52.117 --> 33:54.336
my-my one good thing to-to come

33:54.380 --> 33:56.425
at-at your expense.
Not like this.

33:57.426 --> 33:59.472
Doesn't change how it is.

34:00.864 --> 34:02.823
Hey, um...

34:04.129 --> 34:05.869
What Nate said--
it-it doesn't

34:05.913 --> 34:08.742
have to change
who your father was to you.

34:08.785 --> 34:10.657
He's still the man

34:10.700 --> 34:12.572
who raised you

34:12.615 --> 34:15.314
to be who you are today, okay?

34:15.357 --> 34:16.924
He's still your
port in the storm.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.447
- Yeah, I know.
- He...

34:19.883 --> 34:23.713
I-I know that you're trying
to help me right now, but...

34:23.757 --> 34:26.238
uh, may-maybe don't.

34:26.281 --> 34:28.022
Okay?

34:30.677 --> 34:33.897
Yeah.

34:33.941 --> 34:37.814
I have tried all day

34:37.858 --> 34:39.512
to help your family.

34:39.555 --> 34:43.255
I feel so stupid.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.780
Geri, my-my family

34:46.823 --> 34:49.739
is-is your family.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.698
We are family.

34:51.741 --> 34:54.135
You're-you're a Walker, still.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.311
Through and through.
This doesn't change anything.

34:56.355 --> 34:59.097
Cordi.

34:59.140 --> 35:01.055
Don't kid yourself.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.666
Did you-did you hear?

35:06.147 --> 35:08.454
It changes everything.

35:38.353 --> 35:39.876
I've never seen it empty.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.663
Yeah, me neither.

35:43.706 --> 35:45.839
You know, I walked in,

35:45.882 --> 35:49.059
and the first thing
that came to mind was

35:49.103 --> 35:51.149
that time that Liam

35:51.192 --> 35:53.934
covered that entire
wall with crayon.

35:55.544 --> 35:57.503
We told him he couldn't
play with them at the diner,

35:57.546 --> 36:00.158
and we said,
"Oh, use them at home."

36:00.201 --> 36:02.464
I didn't realize that
we'd have to specify,

36:02.508 --> 36:04.466
you know, that
the walls were off-limits.

36:04.510 --> 36:07.426
Yeah. Weird. I know...
I don't know

36:07.469 --> 36:09.732
- why I thought of that.
- Saying goodbye.

36:09.776 --> 36:12.126
You prepare for
the big memories. It's...

36:12.170 --> 36:13.910
it's the little ones that

36:13.954 --> 36:16.174
- catch you off guard.
- Yeah.

36:19.264 --> 36:21.570
Have you heard from Geri?

36:21.614 --> 36:23.659
No. I mean, I-I, um,

36:23.703 --> 36:25.618
I left some voice mails,

36:25.661 --> 36:27.576
but, uh...

36:27.620 --> 36:29.665
no, I haven't-haven't
heard back.

36:32.015 --> 36:35.367
I just can't believe it's her.

36:35.410 --> 36:38.065
That it was Geri-- our Geri--

36:38.108 --> 36:41.547
and... I had no idea.

36:41.590 --> 36:44.071
Mama...

36:44.114 --> 36:46.726
she doesn't blame you.
You know that.

36:46.769 --> 36:48.728
Not yet.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.166
Do you regret it?

36:52.210 --> 36:54.821
It wasn't easy,
or-or fun. But...

36:54.864 --> 36:57.867
if somebody had to say it,
I guess I'm glad it was me.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.653
Mm-hmm.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.220
Maybe tonight
you'll finally sleep.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.744
Yeah. Me and Daddy.

37:06.136 --> 37:08.095
What's that? You find
something in the move?

37:09.096 --> 37:10.663
Yeah.

37:10.706 --> 37:13.796
Something that I...
I thought was lost.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.625
Okay. Okay.

37:16.669 --> 37:17.626
Well, I guess we
should probably be...

37:17.670 --> 37:19.715
Can you give me a sec?

37:19.759 --> 37:22.240
Course. Yeah. Course.

38:09.896 --> 38:11.289
Hey, Dad.

38:15.641 --> 38:17.077
One last trip to the ranch?

38:17.120 --> 38:19.079
No.

38:19.122 --> 38:21.342
Nah, I don't want
to remember it like that.

38:21.386 --> 38:23.475
A shell of itself.

38:24.519 --> 38:26.521
I'll keep the picture
I have in my head.

38:27.914 --> 38:30.917
Side Step it is, then.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.267
We can't check
in to that hotel until 4:00.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.269
Y'all couldn't
scrounge up a rental?

38:35.313 --> 38:38.228
We had a couple things
going on, Dad.

38:38.272 --> 38:40.666
I know.

38:40.709 --> 38:42.450
Thank you, son.

38:42.494 --> 38:44.452
For believing in me.

38:44.496 --> 38:46.367
Always.

39:00.163 --> 39:01.687
- Hey.
- There he is.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.515
- Hey!
- Daddy.

39:03.558 --> 39:05.299
Ah! Oh!

39:07.823 --> 39:09.172
- Hey, little girl.
- Hi, there.

39:09.216 --> 39:10.652
Well, uh,
welcome back,

39:10.696 --> 39:12.915
Daddy. Uh, y-you-you
know, such-such as it is.

39:14.177 --> 39:15.396
All of us
together anywhere

39:15.440 --> 39:16.745
- is just fine.
- Mm-hmm.

39:16.789 --> 39:18.704
- Amen.
- Okay, sure,

39:18.747 --> 39:20.706
but, like, seriously...

39:20.749 --> 39:22.316
what are we gonna do
for breakfast?

39:22.360 --> 39:23.970
Okay, okay.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.928
Well, I think someone
- is 911 on that bacon.
- Yeah.

39:25.972 --> 39:27.321
Bacon...Maybe this could work?

39:30.716 --> 39:32.065
You know, I thought
we might want to keep

39:32.108 --> 39:33.980
the breakfast tradition
alive, and I got

39:34.023 --> 39:35.329
way too many tacos
down the street, so...You-you can't

39:35.373 --> 39:36.678
get too many tacos.
You know that.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.071
- I taught you that.
- You get an egg...

39:38.114 --> 39:39.420
Hey, stinker,
bacon, egg and cheese?

39:39.464 --> 39:40.726
- Oh, yeah, I got you extra.
- Stinker.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.641
- Yes!
- All right, here's your coffee.

39:42.684 --> 39:44.599
Okay. I knewyou'd...

39:44.643 --> 39:47.210
- There you go.
- Pass it down, pass it
down, pass it down.

39:58.961 --> 40:00.920
Oh, my gosh.

40:00.963 --> 40:04.184
I can't-I
can't believe it's you.

40:04.227 --> 40:06.665
You're here.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.318
Yeah.

40:09.929 --> 40:11.844
Um, I'm gonnaOkay, yeah.

40:11.887 --> 40:12.845
let you...Okay.

40:17.676 --> 40:20.374
Um...

40:20.418 --> 40:22.637
I-I... I am here.

40:24.378 --> 40:26.772
But that's honestly
as I've gotten.

40:26.815 --> 40:28.513
Okay.

40:28.556 --> 40:32.038
And I'm-I'm still
wrapping my head

40:32.081 --> 40:34.344
around being, um...

40:34.388 --> 40:36.129
A Davidson.

40:46.139 --> 40:47.488
Oh, God.

40:52.014 --> 40:53.973
I'm sorry, is that too much?

40:54.016 --> 40:56.932
It's...I'm sorry.

40:56.976 --> 40:58.499
It just...

41:00.283 --> 41:02.460
I just have one question.

41:02.503 --> 41:04.592
- Yeah.
- Gale,

41:04.636 --> 41:06.986
did you know?

41:08.944 --> 41:10.076
That I was out there?

41:13.166 --> 41:16.517
As far as I know...

41:16.561 --> 41:18.606
Abby Walker was
the only one Marv told.

41:19.999 --> 41:21.696
And why she would
keep that a secret

41:21.740 --> 41:24.569
when I could have... I could
have been looking for you,

41:24.612 --> 41:26.614
I-I don't know.
I don't know.

41:28.834 --> 41:30.531
But you're here
now. I...

41:30.575 --> 41:32.533
I just...
I-I'm just willing

41:32.577 --> 41:34.100
to make up for lost time,
if you are.
