00:16.306 --> 00:18.393
she has some pretty big
shoes to fill.

00:18.476 --> 00:20.311

your feet are big.

I mean, they're bigger
than mine, but...

- Yes! Yes! Thank you!

03:43.348 --> 03:47.143
See you at practice!

03:47.226 --> 03:47.977

03:48.061 --> 03:51.648
Bring it in, girls.
Tri-five!

03:51.731 --> 03:54.150

dye in chicken feed,

03:54.233 --> 03:55.818
they'd lay Easter eggs.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.487
But they do not.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.322
- You should write a book.

- Remote spy-cam.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.498
Where'd you get
all this stuff?

04:08.581 --> 04:11.000
- My dad gave me his old
military equipment.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.669
Well, he didn't really
give it to me

04:12.752 --> 04:14.003
so much as I took it from
a box in the basement

04:14.087 --> 04:17.839
that said: "Troy,
do not touch."

04:17.923 --> 04:19.841
- This is so James Bond.

04:19.926 --> 04:24.514
All we need is a mission,
a tuxedo, and a cool accent.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.473
Brilliant!

04:25.556 --> 04:27.976
- I got a mission--
the gum graveyard.

04:28.059 --> 04:31.020
- Not that dumb gum table again.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.689
- It was three weeks ago,

04:32.772 --> 04:35.358
but I remember it
like it was two weeks ago.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.193
There I was enjoying my
post-lunch stick of gum

04:37.276 --> 04:40.113
when I spotted Miss Bennett,
who, as you know,

04:40.196 --> 04:43.199
doesn't look too kindly
on gum chewers.

04:43.282 --> 04:44.701
If I didn't do something fast,

04:44.784 --> 04:47.370
I'd be coolin' my spurs
in detention all week.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.038
So, I stuck my gum
under the table

04:49.122 --> 04:51.416

04:51.499 --> 04:56.421

04:56.504 --> 05:00.216

clear, I grabbed it.

05:00.299 --> 05:04.262

when I realized...

05:04.345 --> 05:07.557
I was chewin' someone else's
old, dirty gum.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.392
Ahhhhhh!

05:09.475 --> 05:12.228
It turns out the underside
of that table was covered in it,

05:12.311 --> 05:13.271
and Miss Bennett made
me spend a week cleaning

05:13.354 --> 05:15.231
that gum graveyard with
nothing but

05:15.314 --> 05:18.609
a dental pick
and my bare hands.

story ten times,

05:23.322 --> 05:26.576

makes me barf?

05:28.119 --> 05:29.078

05:29.162 --> 05:31.247
- Sawyer, I get you're upset.

use this spy stuff

05:33.166 --> 05:34.459

05:41.841 --> 05:43.426

that table yesterday--

Bennett's gonna blame me.

05:49.849 --> 05:53.269

that crusty gum table.

05:53.352 --> 05:54.604
Newt, you in?

05:54.687 --> 05:57.940
- Fine. But if I barf,

Up 360 Tick Tock,

06:20.713 --> 06:23.466

I can try to teach her.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.636
- Oh, she knew it coming in.
- She did?

06:26.719 --> 06:31.933
- Yeah. She just did a Ball
Up 360 Tick Tock Tick.

is just kind of...

19:56.570 --> 19:57.613
First Nikki showed
up and I was happy,

19:57.696 --> 20:00.157
but then you guys were all,
oh, she added a tick,

20:00.240 --> 20:02.075
and Nikki did my pouf and then
you guys were tri-fiving

20:02.159 --> 20:03.869
and blinking and I thought
I was losing you guys,

20:03.952 --> 20:05.537
and the next thing I know

20:05.621 --> 20:07.789
I'm hiding in the bushes
with the guys and--

20:07.873 --> 20:08.790
- Bella, breathe!
- [exhaling]

20:08.874 --> 20:11.460
Wow, that really works.

20:11.543 --> 20:16.340
- Bella, you were the first girl
to talk to me in kindergarten.

20:16.423 --> 20:19.092
- And when I was too scared
to go down the slide,

20:19.176 --> 20:20.802
you held my hand
and slid down with me.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.138
- After all this time,

20:23.221 --> 20:26.433
don't you know you'd always
be our best friend?

20:26.516 --> 20:28.393
- I guess I was just afraid
choosing football

20:28.477 --> 20:29.978
might mean losing you guys.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.273
- Aw, you'll never lose us.

20:33.357 --> 20:36.026
We love you,
you big dumb-dumb.

20:36.109 --> 20:40.822
- See?

20:40.906 --> 20:42.574
- TROY, NEWT, SAWYER:
Awwww...

20:42.658 --> 20:44.117
- That's what we tried
to tell her.

20:44.201 --> 20:48.038
- Yep, stubborn
as a mule, that one.

20:48.121 --> 20:52.250
- TROY &amp; SAWYER: Bye.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.377
- Uh, I never
doubted you, Sophie.

20:53.460 --> 20:57.005
By the way, tell your Canadian
lumberjack boyfriend

20:57.089 --> 20:58.757
I said, uh...

20:58.840 --> 21:00.759
he's a lucky man!

21:00.842 --> 21:02.427
Okay!

21:04.888 --> 21:08.266
- Guys, I am so sorry.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.435
How can I ever
make it up to you?

21:10.519 --> 21:12.771
- You can act totally surprised
at the brunch tomorrow.

21:12.854 --> 21:15.399
- How's this?

21:15.482 --> 21:16.942
[gasping]

21:17.025 --> 21:18.694
- Great.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.780
- ALL: [laughing]

21:26.535 --> 21:28.286
- Chewing gum on
school property?

21:28.370 --> 21:33.083
I think you know
what this means, Mr. Huggins.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.502
- And I think...
you know what this means.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.017
- Carry on, Mr. Huggins.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.143
- Oh, not so fast.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.561
I think you know what
to do with that...

21:52.644 --> 21:55.313
ma'am.
