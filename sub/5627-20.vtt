00:07.710 --> 00:10.580
- -

00:13.580 --> 00:16.120
SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA

00:17.580 --> 00:18.710
What?

00:19.170 --> 00:21.920
I don't know, maybe like 60.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.710
How is that my fault? Business is slow.

00:30.620 --> 00:32.710
-Shoot.
-

00:32.710 --> 00:34.250
What? No, not you.

00:35.830 --> 00:37.670
No, I ain't hiding nothing.

00:37.670 --> 00:38.960
Well, hey, I got an idea for you.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.670
How about you put on these heels and
let's see how much money you make.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.210
Well, until you start
earning better than me,

00:45.080 --> 00:47.580
we ain't got nothing to talk about, okay?

00:47.580 --> 00:48.710
-Bye.
-

01:53.880 --> 01:54.920
Oh!

02:07.250 --> 02:09.250
It's the ninth inning. Bases are loaded.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.670
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

02:10.670 --> 02:12.380
Do you believe it, sports fans?

02:12.380 --> 02:15.670
On the mound is future
Hall-of-Famer Kai Struthers,

02:15.670 --> 02:17.920
pitching to his own grandpa.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.500
The count is 3 and 2.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.290
Will Kai be able to handle the pressure?

02:22.290 --> 02:23.670
He winds up, here's the pitch...

02:24.460 --> 02:26.250
A perfect strike!

02:26.250 --> 02:28.540
The Cubs win! The Cubs win!

02:28.540 --> 02:29.920
-Yay!
-Whoo!

02:30.620 --> 02:31.880
Kai!

02:31.880 --> 02:33.580
Now that you've won the World Series,

02:33.580 --> 02:35.790
I need you to go pick up
all your presents, okay?

02:35.790 --> 02:38.040
Okay, Dad.
Thanks for the mitt, Grandpa.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.460
You're welcome.

02:41.250 --> 02:43.040
-Come on.
-

02:43.040 --> 02:45.790
And he even speaks Italian.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.710
Well, that's what happens
when an American pianist

02:47.710 --> 02:50.250
marries an Italian basketball player.

02:50.250 --> 02:51.620
Perfecto.

02:52.420 --> 02:54.250
Kai is so happy you're here,

02:54.250 --> 02:56.330
especially since Joy couldn't be.

02:56.330 --> 02:59.500
Speaking of which,
where is that wayward daughter of mine

02:59.500 --> 03:01.170
reporting from now?

03:01.170 --> 03:04.500
Sierra Leone.
She got stuck in Customs.

03:04.830 --> 03:08.170
It killed her to miss this party today,
but, work, you know?

03:08.170 --> 03:10.170
Oh, I can relate to that work thing.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.960
Ooh. She would kill me
if she saw the house right now.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.960
-And I'm sorry...
-No, no, no, it's my fault.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.830
I should know better
than to come between kids and cake.

03:22.210 --> 03:23.500
Go ahead. I'll get this.

03:26.330 --> 03:28.210
Oh.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.330
Hi. Uh...

03:30.330 --> 03:32.380
-David's still here and...
-Is everything good?

03:33.040 --> 03:34.210
Yeah.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.120
We have an unexpected guest.

03:43.250 --> 03:46.250
-Hayden.
-Hello, David.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.040
Grandma!

03:48.040 --> 03:49.080
Aw!

03:49.330 --> 03:52.790
There's my little lightning bug. Ooh!

03:53.580 --> 03:55.750
I, uh...

03:56.830 --> 03:58.460
I didn't know you were coming.

03:58.460 --> 03:59.830
Neither did I.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.620
Hayden, you told me
that you weren't going to come.

04:02.620 --> 04:03.710
I wasn't.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.920
When I heard that David was coming,
I didn't want to intrude.

04:08.170 --> 04:10.580
And I realized how foolish that was.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.420
I suppose we should talk, shouldn't we?

04:16.250 --> 04:17.420
Yeah.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.460
We should.

04:21.460 --> 04:22.620
Come on, Kai.

04:23.040 --> 04:24.540
- -

04:26.830 --> 04:28.420
Twenty-nine years.

04:28.710 --> 04:31.830
Twenty-nine years you didn't tell me
that I had a daughter.

04:33.460 --> 04:34.830
You're right.

04:35.710 --> 04:40.080
And when I found out, I called
and texted you for a week straight

04:40.080 --> 04:42.710
and then never got one reply.

04:43.580 --> 04:44.790
You're right.

04:45.080 --> 04:48.000
You don't have anything
better to say than "you're right"?

04:48.380 --> 04:49.620
No.

04:52.580 --> 04:56.290
I know we weren't married long, but...

04:57.210 --> 04:58.620
This isn't like you.

04:58.620 --> 05:01.040
You never did anything
without good reason.

05:01.540 --> 05:02.750
You are right.

05:03.210 --> 05:05.000
Then what changed now?

05:05.500 --> 05:08.540
Why did you decide to show up now?

05:11.040 --> 05:14.500
Because I knew that
I couldn't keep doing this.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.540
That we had to get it behind us

05:16.540 --> 05:19.580
if we were going to be the kind of
grandparents that Kai deserves.

05:20.540 --> 05:23.540
So if you have anything
that you need to say,

05:23.540 --> 05:24.620
say it now.

05:33.290 --> 05:36.880
You never gave me a chance
to be a dad. Why?

05:37.580 --> 05:39.830
Because I always
came second with you.

05:41.580 --> 05:44.790
-That's not true.
-It is true, David.

05:44.790 --> 05:48.210
It was always about the job,
and you made that very clear.

05:48.210 --> 05:50.750
The job came first.

05:51.540 --> 05:53.500
So where would that leave our child?

05:55.290 --> 05:57.380
Still, you could have given me a choice.

05:57.380 --> 05:59.170
And what would you have chosen?

06:00.670 --> 06:02.380
-Hey!
-Look, look, look!

06:02.380 --> 06:04.290
Sorry, I tried to keep him
in the next room.

06:04.290 --> 06:07.670
Oh, that's all right. Come on, show me
what you've got there, darling.

06:08.330 --> 06:09.540
Stick 'em up!-

06:09.830 --> 06:11.830
-Ooh! Stick 'em up. -Oh!

06:11.830 --> 06:14.420
-That's your voice.
-

06:14.880 --> 06:17.960
So, hey, Kai,
what else can that hot rod do, huh?

06:17.960 --> 06:19.960
-Show Grandpa.
-

06:22.750 --> 06:25.790
I, uh... I've gotta take this.

06:30.170 --> 06:31.580
Aw. Look.

06:31.580 --> 06:33.830
-Go ahead, Hotch.
-Hey. I'm sorry to bother you.

06:33.830 --> 06:36.460
I just got a call from Sacramento P.D.
about two Jane Does.

06:36.460 --> 06:37.830
What's the connection?

06:37.830 --> 06:40.290
Both were found
in the same SRO water reserve tank.

06:40.290 --> 06:42.210
Both had their faces
slashed repeatedly.

06:42.210 --> 06:44.540
Water burial. Female offender?

06:44.540 --> 06:46.790
No. Given the physical strength
required, we ruled it out.

06:46.790 --> 06:48.380
I need you to meet us in Sacramento.

06:51.420 --> 06:52.920
Yeah, I'll be there.

06:58.420 --> 07:00.040
Listen, I...

07:02.040 --> 07:03.580
Grandpa's got to go.

07:04.330 --> 07:05.580
Already?

07:06.420 --> 07:08.040
Unfortunately, yes.

07:08.750 --> 07:11.460
We're a man down,
and my team needs me.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.880
We totally get it.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.500
You want some cake for the road?

07:15.500 --> 07:17.380
No, no, no. I'm good.

07:18.540 --> 07:19.790
Hey.

07:20.790 --> 07:22.080
I love you, kiddo.

07:27.420 --> 07:28.670
It's good to see you, David.

07:29.210 --> 07:31.790
Maybe we can do this again
some other time.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.210
Take care, Hayden.

07:52.330 --> 07:54.330
Dani, baby,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.290
-where you been at, girl?
-Around.

07:57.290 --> 07:58.460
Hey, slow down.

07:59.540 --> 08:02.540
I said, slow down.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.670
-How's about a little quid pro quo?
-I'm off it.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.710
Girl like you ain't never
gonna be straight.

08:10.710 --> 08:12.580
-Let me go!
-Or what?

08:12.580 --> 08:14.080
-Enough.
-Hey!

08:17.040 --> 08:18.670
Oh, she's your piece?

08:19.580 --> 08:20.880
Okay.

08:21.670 --> 08:23.250
I'll see you around, Dani.

08:25.710 --> 08:27.960
-You all right?
-No. That guy's a jerk.

08:28.460 --> 08:30.960
Okay. You need a ride somewhere?

08:32.250 --> 08:34.120
Hey, no strings. Just a ride.

08:35.250 --> 08:36.880
-My van's right up there.
-I'm good.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.380
Okay. Cool.

08:40.540 --> 08:42.080
Uh, just be careful.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.830
I passed some guys
like your buddy a few blocks up.

08:47.750 --> 08:49.000
Wait, uh...

08:49.670 --> 08:51.170
You swear no strings?

08:51.170 --> 08:53.920
Yeah, I mean,
I already have a girlfriend. So...

09:00.120 --> 09:02.500
Oh, sorry, I forgot. Front's full.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.210
Would you mind, uh...

09:10.210 --> 09:11.500
What the hell?

09:55.960 --> 09:57.460
"I imagine one of the reasons

09:57.460 --> 10:00.210
"people cling to their hates
so stubbornly

10:00.210 --> 10:03.080
"is because they sense
once hate is gone,

10:03.080 --> 10:05.670
"they will be forced to deal with pain."

10:05.670 --> 10:06.960
James Baldwin.

10:07.290 --> 10:10.290
The two Jane Does were found
in an SRO reserve water tank

10:10.290 --> 10:11.960
in the Oak Park community
of Sacramento.

10:11.960 --> 10:15.040
That area has a high crime rate,
115% higher than the national average.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.710
Yeah, it's known for its drug usage.

10:16.710 --> 10:18.710
And from the track marks
on our victims' arms,

10:18.710 --> 10:20.460
it's apparent they were
familiar with a needle.

10:20.460 --> 10:23.250
So this could be a drug deal
gone wrong or an angry pimp.

10:23.250 --> 10:24.500
And given the surroundings,

10:24.500 --> 10:26.290
it's possible these two
worked as prostitutes.

10:26.290 --> 10:28.580
We should also consider
that he's a moral enforcer.

10:28.580 --> 10:30.540
He could be a vigilante
trying to clean up the streets.

10:30.540 --> 10:33.000
And Oak Park would be
a target-rich environment for him.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.290
All right, when we land,
JJ, meet Rossi at the crime scene.

10:35.290 --> 10:37.620
You two go to the M.E.,
and I'll get us set up at the precinct.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.210
SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA

10:45.460 --> 10:46.710
-Agent Hotchner.
-Detective.

10:46.710 --> 10:47.880
-Thanks for coming out.
-Of course.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.380
We've amped up patrols
like you suggested.

10:49.380 --> 10:50.830
Good. Anything?

10:50.830 --> 10:52.000
Nothing from the units,

10:52.000 --> 10:53.750
but we did manage
to ID one of the victims.

10:53.750 --> 10:56.330
Debi Leitelt, 22, living on the streets.

10:56.330 --> 10:58.580
Ten separate arrests
for solicitation and drug possession.

10:58.580 --> 10:59.670
Her fingerprints were in the system.

11:00.330 --> 11:02.710
Yeah. Four of these arrests
involve Isaac Henry.

11:02.710 --> 11:03.790
We need to talk to him right away.

11:04.210 --> 11:05.330
-I'll get on it.
-Thanks.

11:05.330 --> 11:06.500
Yeah.

11:08.750 --> 11:09.920
You're with Oak Park Police?

11:10.330 --> 11:11.620
I don't think so.

11:11.620 --> 11:13.790
I'm Agent Hotchner with the FBI.

11:13.790 --> 11:15.080
FBI?

11:15.540 --> 11:18.250
Okay, okay.
First, I didn't know she was a minor.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.580
Second, the sign saying
we crossed the state line,

11:20.580 --> 11:22.580
it was like this big.
No warnings, nothing.

11:22.580 --> 11:24.420
What's your relationship
with Debi Leitelt?

11:25.580 --> 11:28.040
-I can't say I know a Debi.
-That's not true.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.960
September 3rd, pandering,
September 18th, pandering...

11:30.960 --> 11:32.750
-All right.
-October 5th, November 14th.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.080
-All right. So what?
-So you two worked together.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.380
-Yeah.
-Did you ever get violent with her?

11:37.380 --> 11:40.210
I didn't have to.
The drugs took care of that.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.290
Why is it the FBI's problem
how I treat my girls?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.460
It's this department's problem
how you treat them.

11:46.460 --> 11:48.330
But when they turn up dead, it's ours.

11:48.830 --> 11:50.120
Debi?

11:54.580 --> 11:55.750
And I thought she was gonna make it.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.170
Make it how?

11:57.790 --> 11:59.710
She wanted out.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.120
She got herself clean.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.000
I never keep my girls on the street
unless they want. Never.

12:07.500 --> 12:08.880
God almighty.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.540
Is that how she normally dressed?

12:11.210 --> 12:12.540
Yeah, why?

12:13.080 --> 12:14.670
Because
we found her wearing this.

12:16.330 --> 12:17.670
Oh, yeah. This?

12:18.460 --> 12:20.710
Not her style. Too square.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.330
Hi. It's your friendly
neighborhood tech analyst.

12:23.330 --> 12:25.750
Garcia, I need you to look up
manufacture and purchase history

12:25.750 --> 12:27.670
on the dress that
Debi Leitelt was found in.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.460
The blue dress?

12:29.460 --> 12:31.710
When and where it was
purchased and if anywhere locally.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.380
-Dress history. I'm on it, sir.-Thanks.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.290
I don't get it.
If it's not her dress, whose is it?

12:39.290 --> 12:40.460
The UnSub redressed her.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.080
The question is
whether it was pre- or post-mortem.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.170
Why would he do that?

12:43.460 --> 12:44.790
It's part of his fantasy.

12:49.330 --> 12:52.670
Garcia said the current residents
checked out.

12:52.670 --> 12:55.040
Just your run-of-the-mill

12:55.040 --> 12:57.830
"leave me alone,
I'm feeding off my own misery" type.

12:57.830 --> 12:59.420
Well, it's probably
less crowded at night,

12:59.420 --> 13:02.120
or at least the UnSub
draws less attention.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.210
Everybody agrees to look the other way.

13:04.920 --> 13:09.960
Getting in and out with a body
would be extremely difficult, though.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.790
Okay, so the question is, this building...

13:14.500 --> 13:15.750
Why pick it?

13:18.080 --> 13:20.040
Well, Rossi, I think we need to get off

13:20.040 --> 13:22.670
this whole "moral enforcer" theory.

13:22.670 --> 13:23.880
How come?

13:23.880 --> 13:27.620
Well, a moral enforcer or vigilante
would display his murders.

13:27.620 --> 13:29.330
He'd want to inspire fear.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.500
This UnSub is going
the other direction.

13:32.790 --> 13:34.580
Ted Bundy, Green River Killer.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.500
Each kill was at separate times,

13:36.500 --> 13:39.000
but they both hoarded
their victims in one spot.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.080
Mmm. And in their cases,
committed necrophilia.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.330
That's not our UnSub's MO.

13:45.380 --> 13:47.290
But revisiting could be.

13:47.290 --> 13:50.620
So he puts them in a tank
for safekeeping.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.170
Speaks to a certain level
of organization.

13:53.170 --> 13:55.080
Only he doesn't think it through.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.750
Decomposition would clog the pipes.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.420
It's only a matter of time
before they're found.

14:00.420 --> 14:03.420
So, why this tank, pal?

14:03.420 --> 14:05.670
There's thousands of tanks
in Sacramento.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.120
Why this one?

14:07.880 --> 14:10.210
You know, there's one other thing
this guy shares with Green River.

14:10.210 --> 14:12.420
-What's that?
-When Washington State Police

14:12.420 --> 14:15.380
found the first five victims
in roughly the same spot in the river,

14:16.120 --> 14:18.380
Ridgway was forced
to find a new disposal site.

14:19.210 --> 14:20.330
Our UnSub will do the same.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.420
Hello?

14:53.500 --> 14:54.750
Hello!

15:00.170 --> 15:01.670
What are you doing?

15:01.670 --> 15:03.920
You can't... You can't do this to me!

15:04.210 --> 15:05.540
Do you trust me?

15:05.540 --> 15:07.330
No! No, no, no, no!

15:07.330 --> 15:08.670
That's why I have to do this.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.920
COD for Debi Leitelt
was exsanguination.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.790
Jane Doe died from sepsis.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.920
Both bodies tested positive
for large amounts of opiates.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.080
Lab is still running
a breakdown on the specifics.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.540
Debi's been clean
for a couple of months,

15:24.540 --> 15:26.210
but given the statistics for relapse,

15:26.210 --> 15:28.460
it's quite possible
she fell off the wagon.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.330
Or the UnSub injected her himself.

15:31.380 --> 15:32.540
Am I reading this right?

15:32.540 --> 15:34.620
Two different blade types
were used on the victims' faces?

15:34.620 --> 15:37.210
Correct. The post-mortem cuts
are facial slashes

15:37.210 --> 15:39.790
made by a precision blade,
something like a scalpel.

15:39.790 --> 15:42.040
A scalpel's an odd choice
for disfigurement.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.000
The antemortem wounds
were made with a jagged tool,

15:44.000 --> 15:45.920
something with a serrated edge.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.380
Okay, so, two distinct tools
for two distinct goals.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.290
-Which are?
-Unclear at this point.

15:51.290 --> 15:54.170
Jane Doe had hydrofluorocarbon
and dimethyl ether in her hair.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.420
And titanium dioxide.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.250
Those first two
are commonly found in aerosols.

15:57.250 --> 16:00.210
Titanium dioxide is a white pigment
found in a wide range of products.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.330
Like spray-in hair color,
blond to be exact.

16:02.330 --> 16:03.960
That's my presumption, yes.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.250
Most of it washed out in the water,

16:05.250 --> 16:07.620
but there are still
trace elements on her scalp.

16:07.620 --> 16:10.500
Uh. Someone who used this
type of cheap hair color all the time

16:10.500 --> 16:12.170
would be more skilled at applying it.

16:12.170 --> 16:13.790
She wouldn't get it all over her scalp.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.380
So the UnSub did it.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.210
Assume these victims are
both victims of opportunity.

16:18.210 --> 16:22.380
High-risk lifestyle, possibly prostitutes,
definitely drug addicts.

16:22.380 --> 16:24.120
We see this victimology all the time.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.920
Easier targets.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.960
It takes a while before anyone
notices they're missing.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.670
Right. That part
he's smart enough to plan for.

16:29.670 --> 16:31.460
If he wanted to kill them quickly,
he could.

16:31.460 --> 16:33.170
Exactly.
Instead he spends time with them.

16:33.170 --> 16:34.960
He puts each one
through a unique ritual.

16:35.250 --> 16:38.120
And he redresses one
and he gives the other a sloppy dye job.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.670
And then he tears their faces apart.

16:40.670 --> 16:43.080
He remakes them
so he can destroy them.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.250
They're surrogates

16:44.250 --> 16:46.460
for the woman who's the real
object of his rage.

16:46.460 --> 16:48.960
And his anger manifests itself
as a sexual release,

16:48.960 --> 16:51.000
and when he's done,
he wants to do it again.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.380
Gardener found her this morning.

17:02.380 --> 17:04.620
Noticed the Jacuzzi lid askew
and went to fix it.

17:04.620 --> 17:05.790
Any witnesses?

17:05.790 --> 17:07.580
No, neighbors didn't see anything.

17:07.580 --> 17:09.460
Well, we profiled
he'd find a new disposal site.

17:09.460 --> 17:11.080
I just didn't think it'd be this public.

17:14.750 --> 17:15.960
What is it?

17:16.880 --> 17:19.420
Uh... First a water tank,
now a covered Jacuzzi.

17:19.420 --> 17:21.710
It's not just the water
that's important to him.

17:22.080 --> 17:24.580
He wants them enclosed,
like a sarcophagus.

17:25.330 --> 17:26.620
How long was she in the water?

17:27.380 --> 17:30.170
Based on body temp,
the M.E. thinks she died two days ago.

17:30.170 --> 17:32.500
But based on when
the family went to bed last night,

17:32.500 --> 17:35.080
she's only been in the water six hours.

17:35.380 --> 17:37.080
A real blond this time.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.670
Exact same dress as Debi.

17:38.670 --> 17:40.040
He's combining elements,

17:40.040 --> 17:42.500
turning the surrogates into the woman
he really wants to hurt.

17:43.290 --> 17:44.420
JJ, look.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.380
It's a suture.

17:46.380 --> 17:48.790
Now, why would he
leave that behind?

17:48.790 --> 17:50.710
He probably ran out of time.

17:50.710 --> 17:52.790
That would explain
the two different types of cuts.

17:52.790 --> 17:54.080
One of them isn't a cut at all.

17:54.830 --> 17:56.000
I don't follow.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.170
Ripping out sutures
would leave behind a jagged edge,

17:58.170 --> 18:00.250
kind of like
when you tear a shirt at its seams.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.750
That's why it looked like the UnSub was
using a serrated knife.

18:02.750 --> 18:04.380
He was actually
trying to hide what he was doing.

18:04.380 --> 18:06.420
And if he was sewing that in the face,

18:06.420 --> 18:09.540
then the post-mortem slashing could
be a forensic countermeasure

18:09.540 --> 18:11.080
to hide the surgical component.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.290
Good timing, boy genius.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.330
I have the 411 on our second victim.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.750
- -The Jane Doe is Belinda Cameron.

18:17.750 --> 18:20.750
She was brought up
on shoplifting, solicitation charges,

18:20.750 --> 18:24.290
but she recently entered rehab
in an effort to turn her life around.

18:24.290 --> 18:26.120
Garcia, what about
our most recent victim?

18:26.120 --> 18:28.920
Is there anyone in the system with a red
rose tattoo on their left wrist?

18:28.920 --> 18:29.960
Uh, "red rose."

18:30.830 --> 18:33.120
Why, yes, there is. Leslie Schellin.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.540
She was nabbed on
possession of a controlled substance.

18:36.540 --> 18:37.790
And looky here.

18:37.790 --> 18:40.330
Her current place of residence
is Changing Lives.

18:40.330 --> 18:41.540
It's a halfway house.

18:41.540 --> 18:43.170
Great. Thanks, Garcia.

18:43.170 --> 18:45.670
Well, it looks like rehab
is the connection.

18:45.670 --> 18:46.750
Let's deliver the profile.

18:47.170 --> 18:48.540
We believe the UnSub we're looking for

18:48.540 --> 18:51.000
is a white male in his
late 20s to early 30s.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.330
He is a surgical sadist,
operating on women

18:53.330 --> 18:56.420
he finds in and around
the recovery community of Oak Park.

18:56.420 --> 18:57.710
The fact that he's able to earn the trust

18:57.710 --> 18:59.790
of the women
in this victim pool leads us to believe

18:59.790 --> 19:01.880
he may be a part of
the recovery community himself.

19:02.380 --> 19:04.620
So he's operating on these
women just to kill them?

19:04.620 --> 19:07.500
Death isn't the goal
for this UnSub, pain is.

19:07.500 --> 19:11.250
He cuts these women to inflict physical
and psychological scars that won't heal.

19:12.330 --> 19:13.500
So who is Victim Zero?

19:13.500 --> 19:16.670
Uh, that brings us to the other part
of this UnSub's psychology.

19:16.670 --> 19:18.540
He's putting these victims
through a transformation,

19:18.540 --> 19:20.420
most likely before
he starts cutting them.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.580
He's dyeing their hair
and changing their clothes.

19:22.580 --> 19:25.790
We believe they're surrogates for
the woman he believes wronged him.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.750
This woman might be
a first victim we haven't found yet.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.880
His anger toward her
wasn't sated after hurting her.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.500
We think this woman, Victim Zero,
has had a personal connection

19:34.500 --> 19:37.330
with this UnSub, and finding her
will be the key to stopping him.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.120
Thank you.

20:35.620 --> 20:36.790
What...

20:36.790 --> 20:38.040
What did you do to me?

20:38.040 --> 20:39.750
Now do you trust me?

20:39.750 --> 20:41.420
Wait, what did you do to me?

20:41.420 --> 20:43.460
What did you do to me?

20:43.460 --> 20:45.170
What are you doing to me?

20:45.170 --> 20:46.580
-What did you do to me?
-Shh.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.830
What is this?

20:53.960 --> 20:55.250
It's phase one.

20:57.710 --> 21:00.420
Maybe Victim Zero
was a junkie who got clean

21:00.420 --> 21:01.790
and rejected the UnSub.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.540
Hmm...

21:04.420 --> 21:05.830
Or maybe she fell off the wagon

21:05.830 --> 21:08.880
and he was furious 'cause he worked
to nurse her back to health.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.040
Hmm. Hmm?

21:14.750 --> 21:18.250
Or maybe she was abducted by aliens.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.790
-Yeah, maybe.
-

21:21.790 --> 21:23.580
Okay, this ends now.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.330
Let me see.

21:29.380 --> 21:32.710
Oh, my goodness. What a cutie.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.710
Wait, is that...

21:35.460 --> 21:36.670
Hayden Montgomery.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.500
Ex-wife Number Two.

21:39.420 --> 21:40.460
Oh.

21:41.620 --> 21:45.330
A lot of water under that bridge
between you two, huh?

21:46.170 --> 21:47.620
Twenty-nine years' worth.

21:47.620 --> 21:49.790
-Too much to get past.
-Hmm.

21:50.170 --> 21:52.620
-Is she unreasonable?
-No.

21:53.670 --> 21:55.120
Is she selfish?

21:55.790 --> 21:57.380
Not in the slightest.

21:58.540 --> 22:01.120
Well, what was her reason
for not telling you about Joy?

22:02.290 --> 22:04.330
The job. This job.

22:05.830 --> 22:07.080
Hmm.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.880
-What?
-Nothing.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.040
Jennifer, what?

22:13.040 --> 22:15.330
Okay, look, I'm... I am on your side,

22:15.880 --> 22:19.000
but... I get it.

22:20.290 --> 22:21.580
Because you're a mom.

22:21.580 --> 22:24.670
No. Because I know you, David Rossi.

22:25.710 --> 22:27.580
You told me
what you were like back then.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.620
Nothing came between you and the job.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.250
Yeah...
Yeah, but I might have put it on hold

22:33.250 --> 22:36.290
if it meant I got the chance
to raise a daughter like Joy.

22:36.290 --> 22:38.210
Well, yeah, it's easy to say that now

22:38.210 --> 22:40.250
because you know
who Joy turned out to be.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.620
But 30 years ago,

22:43.460 --> 22:45.790
would you have really
put your career on hold

22:45.790 --> 22:49.670
for diapers and teething
and all-night crying fits?

22:51.670 --> 22:53.290
Look, Hayden had to make a call,

22:53.290 --> 22:54.960
and maybe it was the wrong call,

22:56.040 --> 22:59.080
but don't pretend

22:59.080 --> 23:01.120
like you don't understand
why she made it.

23:05.290 --> 23:08.250
You know
I say this out of love, right?

23:10.250 --> 23:12.080
Yeah. I do.

23:12.620 --> 23:13.920
- -And thanks.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.170
Guys.

23:16.170 --> 23:18.540
I have weird news and weirder news.

23:18.540 --> 23:21.420
The M.E. just finished the breakdown
of the drugs in our victims.

23:21.420 --> 23:23.120
Morphine and meperidine.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.290
Those are pain management drugs.

23:25.290 --> 23:27.830
Yeah, not exactly the street heroin
they were trying to kick.

23:27.830 --> 23:29.170
Then this isn't about addiction.

23:29.170 --> 23:31.540
This is about trying
to make them feel better

23:31.540 --> 23:32.880
after he cuts them.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.540
A sadist wouldn't do that.

23:34.540 --> 23:36.500
Well, that brings me to the weirder.

23:36.500 --> 23:39.380
We found this
in the right cheek of the third victim.

23:39.380 --> 23:40.960
Is that saline?

23:40.960 --> 23:42.920
Yeah, some kind of improvised implant.

23:43.210 --> 23:46.080
There were no implants
found in the other victims.

23:46.540 --> 23:47.960
He's devolving.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.790
He's starting to get sloppy.

23:49.790 --> 23:53.170
It looks like the edges
of the plastic have been melted,

23:53.170 --> 23:54.670
like a vacuum sealer.

23:54.670 --> 23:56.960
Yeah, we got Garcia on the case,
but do the math.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.210
Pain medication plus implant...
Gets you what?

23:59.210 --> 24:01.250
He thinks he's helping these women.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.040
Take these.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.080
-They'll make you feel better.
-No. I'm trying to kick.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.710
It's necessary, I promise.

24:13.580 --> 24:14.960
Now drink.

24:17.790 --> 24:18.960
That's good.

24:22.170 --> 24:23.790
Are you ready for phase two?

24:36.040 --> 24:37.540
Are you gonna keep hurting me?

24:37.540 --> 24:39.460
No. Never.

24:39.460 --> 24:41.040
Look at me. Never again.

24:41.670 --> 24:42.960
Never again.

24:43.710 --> 24:45.040
It's okay, I'm just...

24:48.040 --> 24:49.170
It's okay.

25:03.540 --> 25:04.710
Almost there.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.330
You're beautiful, Sarah.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.540
It looks like the UnSub
attempted to cut flaps

25:33.540 --> 25:36.460
in the right cheek
and then sew them back together.

25:36.460 --> 25:37.670
Look at his work.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.920
This is the kind of medical knowledge
you get off the Internet.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.790
What's he trying to accomplish
by sewing the cheeks up improperly?

25:42.790 --> 25:45.670
He's choosing to distort
his victims' faces.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.420
I thought you guys said
he was trying to help.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.080
No. He thinks he is.

25:49.920 --> 25:54.330
Okay, so, we know these women
are surrogates for her.

25:54.330 --> 25:57.120
We thought he was furious with them,
but we now know that's wrong.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.670
-He's in love with her.
-Yeah.

26:00.670 --> 26:03.500
Now, the implant
is much like the dress or the blond hair.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.210
It's part of the transformation.

26:05.210 --> 26:07.250
But implants are supposed
to make you prettier.

26:07.750 --> 26:08.920
He's making them uglier.

26:08.920 --> 26:11.170
Uglier according to
conventional standards.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.250
To him they're more beautiful.

26:12.710 --> 26:14.540
Somewhere in his love map,

26:14.540 --> 26:17.380
he obsessed over someone
society didn't want to look at.

26:18.330 --> 26:19.790
That's our Victim Zero.

26:20.380 --> 26:22.960
He's doing all of this
because he wants her back.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.290
My name is Danielle.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.500
I'm 90 days sober.

26:31.420 --> 26:34.040
I got sober for my little brother.

26:39.250 --> 26:42.620
I didn't want him to think I was someone

26:42.620 --> 26:43.960
who wasn't going to be there for him.

26:46.210 --> 26:50.330
My... My brother's name is Ian.

26:50.580 --> 26:54.420
I'm going to be at his graduation
and I'm going to be clean for him.

26:58.710 --> 27:00.920
I was gonna make up
for all the times I wasn't there

27:00.920 --> 27:02.750
because I was too messed up.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.920
My name is Danielle.

27:05.420 --> 27:06.960
This isn't my dress.

27:07.380 --> 27:08.710
This isn't my face.

27:10.380 --> 27:12.670
Please, my name is Danielle!

27:13.620 --> 27:15.000
This isn't...

27:16.330 --> 27:17.420
Me.

27:17.710 --> 27:18.880
What have you got, Garcia?

27:18.880 --> 27:20.460
I got a hit
on a Danielle Steinhardt.

27:20.460 --> 27:21.830
She's been missing
for the past two days.

27:21.830 --> 27:23.120
Does she fit his victimology?

27:23.120 --> 27:24.880
She's blond,
and she's been living

27:24.880 --> 27:27.580
at a treatment facility in Oak Park for
the past couple of months.

27:27.580 --> 27:29.710
Her brother reported her missing
when she didn't check back in.

27:29.710 --> 27:32.250
Where are we on the medical conditions
that Victim Zero might have had?

27:32.250 --> 27:33.830
Nothing yet.
But if you direct me,

27:33.830 --> 27:35.460
I can be a much more effective missile.

27:35.460 --> 27:37.250
Well, this guy's trigger
happened recently,

27:37.250 --> 27:40.040
so look for car accidents,
overdoses, suicides.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.580
We also think his ideal

27:41.580 --> 27:43.540
may have some sort of facial deformity.

27:43.880 --> 27:46.670
Uh... No, still bubkes.

27:49.620 --> 27:51.290
A neurofibroma.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.290
Garcia, look up "neurofibromatosis."

27:54.290 --> 27:55.920
Uh... How do you spell that?

27:55.920 --> 27:57.920
Wait, never mind, auto-correct has it.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.880
Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder

27:59.880 --> 28:01.830
that causes tumors
to form on nerve tissue.

28:01.830 --> 28:03.170
Okay, Garcia, look for women

28:03.170 --> 28:05.750
with tumors embedded in the nerves
on the right side of their face.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.420
That's where all the implants
have been.

28:07.790 --> 28:11.120
Okay, there's a rehabilitation center
that specializes in that at U.C. Davis.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.580
It's not the rehab
we've been talking about.

28:12.580 --> 28:13.920
It's the medical kind, but... Okay.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.080
I'm gonna dig into this.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.040
I will hit you back when I find a bone.
Okay? Bye.

28:21.750 --> 28:23.580
There's one last thing for you to see.

28:37.290 --> 28:38.460
What's up, Garcia?

28:38.460 --> 28:40.000
Everybody,
look at your tablets.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.250
I give you Sarah Sherwood,

28:42.250 --> 28:46.670
28, blond, and the poor sweetheart
suffered from neurofibromatosis.

28:46.670 --> 28:49.080
She drowned herself
at her parents' house three weeks ago.

28:49.080 --> 28:51.250
Roughly around the time the first victim
would have gone missing.

28:51.620 --> 28:53.330
She drowned herself
in the worst way I can imagine.

28:53.330 --> 28:55.670
Her parents had a pool
with a retractable tarp.

28:55.670 --> 28:58.750
She held down the remote
and she covered herself under it.

28:59.580 --> 29:00.880
She wanted to lock herself in it.

29:00.880 --> 29:04.250
That explains why he chooses
enclosed bodies of water for his victims.

29:04.250 --> 29:07.960
And puts them in the same dress
she wore when she killed herself.

29:07.960 --> 29:11.620
The only person who would know that
is the one who found the body.

29:11.620 --> 29:12.830
Garcia?

29:12.830 --> 29:16.330
Yes, yes, sir, I am on that
like brown on super healthy rice.

29:16.330 --> 29:20.080
Uh... That would be her boyfriend.
He goes by the name of Joseph Berzon.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.790
According to police,
he was inconsolable.

29:22.120 --> 29:24.420
But how is Joseph connected
to the other victims?

29:24.420 --> 29:26.080
He works for Delivery Dining.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.710
They deliver to treatment centers
and the SRO

29:27.710 --> 29:28.920
where the first two victims were found.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.620
That's how he gets access
to the pain medication.

29:30.620 --> 29:33.210
The worse the rehab center,
the more lax they are with the drugs

29:33.210 --> 29:34.420
and the easier they are to steal.

29:34.420 --> 29:35.580
And according
to their website,

29:35.580 --> 29:37.210
they seal their meals
with a vacuum sealer.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.920
Garcia,
where can we find Joseph?

29:38.920 --> 29:41.120
I'm sending you his work
and home address.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.120
What do you think?

30:16.540 --> 30:17.830
Don't you like it, Sarah?

30:22.330 --> 30:23.580
Who's Sarah?

30:25.120 --> 30:26.460
You are.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.170
This is your room.

30:29.420 --> 30:31.000
We decorated it together,

30:31.620 --> 30:33.460
for when you were ready
to move in with me.

30:58.170 --> 30:59.380
Remember her?

31:04.040 --> 31:05.380
She's your favorite.

31:07.330 --> 31:09.420
You always said
she looked just like you.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.250
Maybe this will help you remember.

31:29.540 --> 31:30.960
Yes.

31:32.290 --> 31:33.500
I remember.

31:33.830 --> 31:35.420
-You do?
-I do.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.120
You...

31:38.880 --> 31:40.120
Did all this for me.

31:40.920 --> 31:42.170
I'll do anything for you.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.170
-Anything?
-Anything.

31:46.710 --> 31:47.960
Just tell me what you want.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.250
Let me go outside.

31:52.830 --> 31:54.170
I can't.

31:54.620 --> 31:57.040
After last time? I can't.

31:57.580 --> 31:59.040
You have to understand.

32:06.540 --> 32:08.120
I understand perfectly.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.250
- -

32:25.290 --> 32:26.500
Sarah!

32:30.710 --> 32:33.210
Help me. Help me.

32:33.210 --> 32:35.460
Oh, my God. Are you...
What's wrong with you?

32:35.460 --> 32:36.790
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

32:36.790 --> 32:38.250
Sarah, you can't be out of bed.

32:38.250 --> 32:39.460
My wife just got out of the hospital.

32:39.460 --> 32:40.830
But is she okay?

32:40.830 --> 32:42.210
It's just her medication.
She'll be all right.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.710
Thank you. I'm sorry we bothered you.

32:43.710 --> 32:44.830
Okay.

32:45.210 --> 32:46.620
Why would you do that?

32:46.620 --> 32:47.880
You're crazy.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.250
I'm crazy?

32:54.210 --> 32:55.880
Did you see the way he looked at you?

32:55.880 --> 32:58.500
He was polite,
but only because he had to be.

33:00.670 --> 33:02.670
Who else is going
to love you the way I do?

33:02.670 --> 33:04.290
Who, Sarah?

33:04.960 --> 33:06.210
Nobody.

33:06.620 --> 33:09.000
- -That's right.

33:09.620 --> 33:13.040
That's right.
That's why we stay inside, forever.

33:20.380 --> 33:22.000
Hey, Garcia, you're on speaker.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.210
I've got background
on Joseph Berzon.

33:24.210 --> 33:25.830
-Anything stand out?-Oh, yeah.

33:25.830 --> 33:26.960
When he was 11,

33:26.960 --> 33:30.080
his mother was in a car accident
that completely mutilated her face.

33:30.080 --> 33:32.290
She was then bedridden for three years

33:32.290 --> 33:34.170
and then died as a result of her injuries.

33:34.170 --> 33:35.380
He had no other living family.

33:35.380 --> 33:38.380
That event must have imprinted on him
and stayed with him all these years.

33:38.380 --> 33:40.750
And after that, he was
put in the foster care system,

33:40.750 --> 33:44.290
and then the group home he was in
was busted on abuse charges.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.420
Sounds like
the kid went through

33:45.420 --> 33:46.830
a lot of physical and emotional pain.

33:46.830 --> 33:48.460
That's one hell of a stressor.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.330
What should we do tonight?

33:56.710 --> 33:58.040
Something's wrong.

33:58.330 --> 33:59.790
No. No.

34:00.290 --> 34:02.210
Everything is exactly right.

34:02.210 --> 34:03.500
Look how pretty you are.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.000
Reid and I
are nearly at Berzon's work.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.250
Is there anything else, Garcia?

34:08.250 --> 34:11.120
Yeah. I also found some interesting
emails between Sarah and her parents.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.290
What are they about?

34:12.290 --> 34:14.420
A month ago,
there was an incident at a park.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.620
What kind of incident?

34:15.620 --> 34:17.920
Well, Sarah didn't go outside much,

34:17.920 --> 34:20.580
and according to one of
these email exchanges,

34:20.580 --> 34:23.380
she was really embarrassed
about the tumors on her face,

34:23.380 --> 34:25.830
but Joseph encouraged her
to give it a try.

34:26.750 --> 34:28.080
That's when things got bad.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.790
Everyone is staring at me.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.250
Hey. I'm here.

34:37.250 --> 34:38.920
We can get through anything together.

34:39.790 --> 34:41.040
Do you trust me?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.620
I trust you, Joseph.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.830
Oh. I left your favorite wine in the car.

34:52.830 --> 34:54.040
Leave it.

34:55.170 --> 34:57.120
No. Just give me a second.
I'll be right back.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.380
No. I...

34:59.960 --> 35:01.250
He left her alone...

35:04.830 --> 35:06.540
And she had an anxiety attack.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.580
Two days later, he found her dead.

35:25.960 --> 35:28.620
Then this isn't just
about recreating Sarah,

35:28.620 --> 35:30.540
it's about rewriting the past.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.620
He thinks he can get it right this time.

35:36.500 --> 35:37.750
Darling.
-

35:38.330 --> 35:40.540
Darling, get up, please.

35:40.540 --> 35:41.830
Please.

35:44.290 --> 35:45.420
I'm dying.

35:45.420 --> 35:47.750
No, no, no. You're not dying.

35:47.750 --> 35:49.420
No. No.

35:49.420 --> 35:50.960
You're gonna be fine.

35:57.750 --> 35:59.250
You're going to be all right.

35:59.670 --> 36:02.080
Everything is going to be all right.
I'll save you.

36:02.080 --> 36:03.420
FBI!

36:04.420 --> 36:07.210
Joseph Berzon,
step away from Danielle.

36:07.210 --> 36:08.380
No! Stay away!

36:08.380 --> 36:10.250
Joseph, look at her. She needs help.

36:10.250 --> 36:11.830
I'm the only one who can give it to her.

36:11.830 --> 36:13.000
You don't understand her.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.170
Don't you love Sarah?

36:14.170 --> 36:15.790
Of course. How can you ask me that?

36:15.790 --> 36:18.040
Then accept
that she's gone, Joseph.

36:18.040 --> 36:20.580
All you're doing
is hurting innocent women

36:20.580 --> 36:23.080
who never wanted you
to make this choice for them.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.460
That's not Sarah.

36:24.460 --> 36:26.120
She never was.

36:27.790 --> 36:30.120
-Do you trust me?
-I trust you, Joseph.

36:32.830 --> 36:34.500
Joseph!

36:54.580 --> 36:55.830
It's okay.

36:55.830 --> 36:57.710
-I'm with the FBI.
-

36:57.710 --> 36:59.080
You're gonna be okay.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.500
I'm Danielle, right?

37:03.000 --> 37:05.120
Yes. Danielle.

37:05.830 --> 37:07.330
My name is David.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.420
Thank you.

37:12.750 --> 37:14.080
Thank you.

37:19.620 --> 37:23.380
"Since love grows within you,
so beauty grows.

37:23.380 --> 37:26.040
"For love is the beauty of the soul."

37:26.040 --> 37:27.880
Saint Augustine.

37:31.790 --> 37:33.620
Hey, Shawn. It's me.

37:34.290 --> 37:37.120
I've got a quick question
I want to ask you.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.170
I hope I didn't wake you.

37:45.620 --> 37:47.250
Shawn told me you were coming.

37:48.120 --> 37:50.960
-Would you like to come in?
-No, I... I should be getting back.

37:54.750 --> 37:58.500
For Kai's sake, you wanted me
to say what I needed to say,

37:58.500 --> 38:01.830
and I figured out what that is.

38:02.620 --> 38:03.790
All right.

38:07.790 --> 38:11.040
I can't wave a magic wand
and change what happened.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.830
But what I can do

38:14.540 --> 38:16.170
is understand why you did it.

38:18.170 --> 38:19.880
You were in the trenches,

38:20.460 --> 38:23.790
turning what I'm sure
was a handful of a little girl

38:24.580 --> 38:26.750
into a confident, beautiful woman.

38:28.290 --> 38:30.710
And I'm sure that
couldn't have been easy.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.790
You have no idea.

38:34.040 --> 38:37.580
-Oh, I think I have some.
-

38:37.960 --> 38:41.040
She left home to accept a scholarship
and never told me.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.290
Oh, I can do better.

38:43.290 --> 38:46.290
One time she met
a serial killer in a dark alley

38:46.290 --> 38:47.500
and never told me.

38:47.500 --> 38:50.540
-She what?
-That's a story best told another time.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.420
Maybe.

38:55.790 --> 38:57.500
Do you know what the biggest
difference is now

38:57.500 --> 38:59.250
than when I was raising Joy?

38:59.250 --> 39:01.540
-What's that? -I'm exhausted.

39:03.420 --> 39:07.000
I just seem to remember
having so much more energy

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
-dealing with a 5-year-old.
-

39:10.000 --> 39:12.210
Especially one who doesn't
want to settle down

39:12.210 --> 39:14.170
for a bedtime story.

39:14.170 --> 39:15.880
All right,
you get to pick two books.

39:15.880 --> 39:20.080
You know, it just so happens
that bedtime stories are my specialty.

39:20.080 --> 39:21.620
So I've heard.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.580
Would you like to stay, David?

39:35.250 --> 39:36.460
Yeah.

39:38.790 --> 39:39.830
I would.
