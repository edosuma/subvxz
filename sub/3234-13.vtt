01:12.676 --> 01:14.244
Well, hello again.
 Hi!

01:14.278 --> 01:15.946
I hope we're not too late.

01:15.980 --> 01:17.148
No, no.
Perfect timing.

01:17.182 --> 01:19.050
Okay, Stan, this is
my husband Walt.

01:19.084 --> 01:20.517
Hi.
Good to meet you, Walt.

01:20.551 --> 01:21.785
Nice to meet you.

01:21.819 --> 01:24.120
Sandia Laboratories, huh?
Yeah.

01:24.154 --> 01:26.856
I hear some pretty fascinating
stuff goes on out there.

01:26.890 --> 01:28.792
Ah, well, you know--

01:28.826 --> 01:30.359
Working on anything
you can talk about?

01:30.394 --> 01:33.228
I'm picturing
giant space lasers.

01:33.262 --> 01:34.529
Am I right?

01:34.563 --> 01:36.364
Honestly, what I do
would bore you senseless.

01:36.398 --> 01:38.332
Oh!
But giant space lasers?

01:38.366 --> 01:39.732
Now, that sounds cool.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.801
I'll have to bring it up
at our next staff meeting.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.334
Well, just remember
I get a cut.

01:43.369 --> 01:44.669
All right, that's a deal.

01:44.703 --> 01:45.736
So this is it, honey.

01:45.771 --> 01:47.337
What do you say?

01:47.371 --> 01:48.905
Do you want to take a tour?
Sure.

01:48.939 --> 01:50.039
Okay.

01:51.607 --> 01:54.743
Look, how about I give
y'all some privacy?

01:54.777 --> 01:57.546
I'll go out to the car
and make a few calls.

01:57.580 --> 01:59.214
Take as much time as you need.

01:59.248 --> 02:00.481
All right.
Good.

02:00.516 --> 02:01.549
Okay.
Thanks.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.720
He's actually a nice guy.
He doesn't push.

02:06.754 --> 02:07.787
Yeah.

02:07.822 --> 02:10.857
So, as you can see,
there's, uh...

02:10.890 --> 02:12.759
there's a kind of flow
going on here.

02:12.794 --> 02:14.360
It's a nice big living room.
Yeah.

02:14.395 --> 02:18.463
And this is the dining area.

02:18.498 --> 02:20.765
Ah, the dining area.
Right. Yes.

02:20.799 --> 02:22.066
Oh, and, uh--

02:23.568 --> 02:26.269
It's got a pool.
Oh, pool is nice.

02:26.304 --> 02:28.138
Mm-hmm.

02:28.172 --> 02:30.339
Backyard could be
a little bigger.

02:30.374 --> 02:33.608
Um, and-- Oh,
there's a breakfast bar

02:33.643 --> 02:36.244
kind of dealie here which is nice.
Jesus.

02:36.278 --> 02:39.248
And, uh, I don't know,
the kitchen's really spacious

02:39.282 --> 02:42.451
and, you know,
got good appliances, and--

02:42.485 --> 02:43.953
How many bedrooms?

02:43.987 --> 02:45.487
Three.

02:45.522 --> 02:46.488
Told you.

02:46.523 --> 02:48.056
There'll all
pretty good size, and--

02:48.091 --> 02:50.625
Oh, this is the first one here.

02:50.659 --> 02:53.327
And then there's
two more at the back.

02:53.362 --> 02:55.129
Only three bedrooms?

02:55.163 --> 02:57.531
I think we're gonna
need at least five.

02:57.565 --> 02:58.532
Don't you think?

02:58.566 --> 03:00.134
Five?
Yeah.

03:00.168 --> 03:02.936
What? Do I look like I'm
about to drop a litter?

03:02.971 --> 03:04.504
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Dude.

03:04.538 --> 03:08.707
No, we'll have three kids
total, eventually.

03:08.742 --> 03:11.209
But we'll need
a spare room for a study

03:11.244 --> 03:13.678
so that I could work at home
and you can write.

03:15.381 --> 03:16.681
Nah, I don't--

03:16.715 --> 03:18.650
I don't think this
is gonna be enough.

03:20.519 --> 03:23.522
Okay. Um, what about
a wine cellar?

03:23.556 --> 03:25.924
I mean, we certainly
cannot be expected

03:25.958 --> 03:27.626
to live without a wine cellar.

03:27.660 --> 03:28.994
Very funny.
Mmm.

03:29.029 --> 03:31.997
I just think we need to set
our sights high is all.

03:32.031 --> 03:33.665
At least higher than here.

03:33.699 --> 03:36.968
Walt, this is
a good neighborhood.

03:37.002 --> 03:38.736
It's got a good elementary

03:38.770 --> 03:40.538
and supposedly
a very good high school.

03:40.572 --> 03:41.905
And believe me--

03:41.940 --> 03:45.709
'cause I have definitely
looked everywhere--

03:45.743 --> 03:47.277
for our price range,

03:47.311 --> 03:48.878
this is as good as it gets.

03:48.912 --> 03:50.980
Well, then let's
stretch our price range.

03:51.014 --> 03:52.314
Truly.

03:52.349 --> 03:55.350
I mean, why buy a starter house

03:55.385 --> 03:58.153
when we'll have to move out
in a year or two?

03:58.187 --> 04:00.055
Did you win the lottery
and not tell me?

04:00.090 --> 04:02.424
I'm serious.

04:02.459 --> 04:06.228
Come on. Why be cautious?

04:06.262 --> 04:08.063
We've got nowhere to go but up.

04:12.734 --> 04:22.069
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

06:22.468 --> 06:23.535
Yeah.

06:23.569 --> 06:25.904
<i>Walter, you see us?</i>

06:25.939 --> 06:27.339
Yeah, I see you.

06:27.374 --> 06:29.942
<i>I'd like you
to exit your vehicle</i>

06:29.977 --> 06:32.212
<i>and start walking toward us.</i>

06:32.246 --> 06:33.947
And then what?

06:33.982 --> 06:37.184
I'm gonna need some...

06:37.218 --> 06:40.254
some kind of assurance.

06:40.288 --> 06:43.290
<i>I assure you I could kill you
from way over here,</i>

06:43.325 --> 06:45.259
<i>if it makes you feel
any better.</i>

07:39.918 --> 07:43.821
Walter, you've been busy.

07:43.856 --> 07:45.223
You want to put your arms out

07:45.257 --> 07:46.958
to the sides for me,
if you would?

08:03.644 --> 08:06.479
You know I haven't slept
since Thursday?

08:06.514 --> 08:09.682
I was out all night
cleaning up after you.

08:09.717 --> 08:11.618
I need my sleep.

08:13.254 --> 08:15.455
You said no half measures.

08:15.489 --> 08:16.889
Yeah.

08:16.924 --> 08:20.593
Funny how words can be
so open to interpretation.

08:22.997 --> 08:24.864
You get your car fixed?

08:24.899 --> 08:26.332
Not yet.

08:26.366 --> 08:28.467
You're gonna want
to get your car fixed.

08:28.502 --> 08:30.569
Let's see how this goes first.

09:05.973 --> 09:08.341
Has your condition worsened?

09:08.375 --> 09:09.542
Excuse me?

09:09.576 --> 09:12.711
Your medical condition,
has it grown worse?

09:12.745 --> 09:14.813
Not that I know of, no.

09:14.847 --> 09:17.649
Is there a ringing in your ears?
No.

09:17.684 --> 09:19.985
Are you seeing bright lights
or hearing voices?

09:21.655 --> 09:23.089
I'm quite well, thank you.

09:23.123 --> 09:25.959
No. Clearly you are not.

09:25.993 --> 09:29.496
No rational person
would do as you have done.

09:30.765 --> 09:32.466
Explain yourself.

09:35.971 --> 09:39.406
My partner was about
to get himself shot.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.574
I intervened.

09:41.609 --> 09:43.877
Some worthless junkie--

09:43.911 --> 09:47.180
For him you intervene
and put us all at risk?

09:47.214 --> 09:48.781
Some contemptible junkie

09:48.816 --> 09:50.983
who couldn't keep
the peace for eight hours?

09:51.018 --> 09:54.019
That's right.
He couldn't.

09:54.054 --> 09:56.689
He was angry because
those two dealers of yours

09:56.723 --> 09:59.225
had just murdered
an 11-year-old boy.

09:59.259 --> 10:00.994
I heard about it.

10:01.028 --> 10:03.763
He should have let me
take care of them.

10:03.798 --> 10:05.699
Maybe.

10:05.733 --> 10:07.501
Then again, maybe he thought

10:07.535 --> 10:09.236
it was you who gave the order.

10:12.674 --> 10:15.009
Are you asking me

10:15.044 --> 10:17.812
if I ordered
the murder of a child?

10:20.415 --> 10:22.082
I would never ask you that.

10:28.489 --> 10:30.389
Where is Pinkman now?

10:32.625 --> 10:33.925
I wouldn't know.

10:35.261 --> 10:37.662
A couple of time zones
away, at least.

10:39.231 --> 10:41.933
Beyond that,
I'd only be guessing.

10:41.967 --> 10:44.035
He has enough money
to last forever.

10:44.069 --> 10:46.537
He knows he needs
to keep moving.

10:46.571 --> 10:48.506
You'll never find him.

10:48.540 --> 10:50.374
I don't know, Walt.

10:50.409 --> 10:52.876
It's what I do, after all.

10:56.014 --> 10:58.081
He's out of the picture.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.149
I saved his life.
I owed him that.

11:00.184 --> 11:02.218
But now he and I are done,

11:02.252 --> 11:04.553
which is exactly what
you wanted, isn't it?

11:10.227 --> 11:13.663
You've always struck me
as a very pragmatic man,

11:13.697 --> 11:17.333
so if I may, I would like
to review options with you

11:17.367 --> 11:21.471
of which it seems
to me you have two.

11:21.505 --> 11:23.673
Option A--

11:23.707 --> 11:25.342
you kill me right here and now.

11:25.376 --> 11:28.645
Apparently, I have made
that very easy for you.

11:28.679 --> 11:32.048
You can kill me--
no witnesses--

11:32.083 --> 11:35.452
and then spend the next
few weeks or months

11:35.486 --> 11:38.255
tracking down Jesse Pinkman,
and you kill him too.

11:38.289 --> 11:41.458
A pointless exercise,
it seems to me.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.293
But that is Option A.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.795
What is Option B?

11:44.829 --> 11:46.263
I continue cooking.

11:46.298 --> 11:49.466
You and I both
forget about Pinkman.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.668
We forget this ever happened.

11:51.702 --> 11:54.671
We consider this a lone hiccup

11:54.705 --> 11:58.275
in an otherwise
long and fruitful

11:58.310 --> 11:59.576
business arrangement.

12:01.446 --> 12:02.947
I prefer Option B.

12:10.088 --> 12:12.556
You'd need a new assistant.

12:13.725 --> 12:14.992
I could get right on that.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.026
No.

12:16.061 --> 12:18.396
This time, I choose.

12:34.648 --> 12:36.282
Your car.

12:36.317 --> 12:38.418
Get it fixed.

12:38.452 --> 12:39.886
Yeah.

13:19.095 --> 13:20.095
Really?

13:48.825 --> 13:50.259
It's good to see you.

13:52.095 --> 13:53.129
Thanks.

13:54.965 --> 13:56.299
It's good to be back.

13:57.968 --> 14:00.069
Well, shall we?

14:00.104 --> 14:03.206
By all means, Gale, let's cook.

14:12.043 --> 14:13.644
What about that rhinoceros?

14:13.678 --> 14:15.245
You think he'd make a good pet?

14:15.279 --> 14:16.680
No.
No?

14:16.714 --> 14:18.281
Don't you think
if you called to him,

14:18.315 --> 14:19.482
he'd come running
for his supper?

14:19.517 --> 14:20.483
I'll bet he would.

14:20.518 --> 14:21.651
I bet he'd come running.

14:23.788 --> 14:25.255
You're silly, Pop Pop.

14:25.290 --> 14:26.624
Well, a little.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.425
But he'd probably
knock everything over.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.060
Plus, there's
that big nose of his.

14:30.095 --> 14:32.596
That's not a nose.
That's a horn.

14:32.631 --> 14:34.332
Is that so?

14:34.366 --> 14:36.233
His real nose is little.

14:36.268 --> 14:38.435
Huh.

14:38.470 --> 14:40.704
I learn all kinds of
things being with you.

14:45.310 --> 14:47.178
Okay, June Bug,
these are for you.

14:47.212 --> 14:48.512
What about the rest?

14:48.547 --> 14:49.747
The rest are for me.

14:49.781 --> 14:50.748
No, they're not.

14:50.783 --> 14:52.517
You're too old for balloons.

14:52.551 --> 14:55.821
Oh, you're never
too old for balloons.

14:55.855 --> 14:58.857
Give me a hug.
Oh, I see your mama.

14:58.892 --> 15:00.226
Don't keep her waiting.

15:00.260 --> 15:01.227
Bye, Pop Pop.

15:01.261 --> 15:02.528
Bye, baby.

17:08.823 --> 17:10.623
Please. Please, no.

18:29.670 --> 18:31.670
Chow, do you have anything
you want to tell me?

18:32.440 --> 18:34.007
Thank God you're here.

18:34.042 --> 18:35.776
They keep me prisoner.

18:35.811 --> 18:37.111
They keep you prisoner.

18:37.146 --> 18:39.414
I don't do nothing
for them ever.

18:39.448 --> 18:41.682
They try and make me.

18:41.716 --> 18:42.750
I say no.

18:42.784 --> 18:44.786
They steal my chemicals.

18:44.820 --> 18:46.787
I can't stop them.

18:46.822 --> 18:48.055
I am businessman.

18:48.089 --> 18:49.056
You're a businessman--

18:49.090 --> 18:51.091
The lady out front--

18:51.125 --> 18:52.993
Hey, lady, are you still there?

18:52.994 --> 18:54.627
Ask her if she's still there.

19:09.544 --> 19:10.844
She says yes.

19:11.847 --> 19:13.548
How's her driving?

19:13.582 --> 19:15.917
Driving. Is she good
behind the wheel?

19:15.952 --> 19:18.353
Good. She's good driver.

19:18.388 --> 19:21.290
Licensed? Dependable?

19:21.324 --> 19:22.758
She has a Camry.

19:22.792 --> 19:25.126
Good.

19:28.864 --> 19:31.865
The trucks will be here
first thing in the morning.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.367
I strongly recommend

19:33.401 --> 19:35.735
that you return
our calls next time.

19:35.770 --> 19:37.971
So have her drive you
to the hospital.

19:42.376 --> 19:44.444
She's gonna need her shoe.

19:55.723 --> 19:57.124
Where did they cross?

19:57.158 --> 19:59.293
Laredo, looks like.

19:59.327 --> 20:01.729
They didn't exactly send
their A players.

20:01.763 --> 20:03.830
But like you said,
it's cartel, all right.

20:07.368 --> 20:09.135
Probing for weakness.

20:09.169 --> 20:10.669
Hmm.

20:10.704 --> 20:12.194
Well, they didn't find any.

20:14.767 --> 20:17.102
What about Pinkman?

20:17.136 --> 20:21.167
I'm making inquiries.

20:36.962 --> 20:38.396
Done. That's two?

20:38.430 --> 20:40.198
All right.
Let's close it up.

20:48.674 --> 20:50.108
Bring it down.

20:51.276 --> 20:53.244
Ready?

20:56.949 --> 20:58.449
Great. Okay.

20:58.484 --> 20:59.650
We're good.

21:05.157 --> 21:07.091
You can take your mask off now.

21:18.203 --> 21:19.770
Does that guy ever leave?

21:19.805 --> 21:21.038
Nah.

21:23.375 --> 21:25.877
When exactly did that start?

21:25.911 --> 21:27.411
It's new.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.114
We had a...

21:31.783 --> 21:34.652
We had a little drama
with the person you replaced.

21:36.188 --> 21:37.555
I'm sorry to hear that.

21:37.589 --> 21:39.290
No, it'll be fine.

21:39.324 --> 21:41.058
Things will continue
to smooth out,

21:41.093 --> 21:43.928
and, yeah, it'll be fine.

21:47.399 --> 21:51.068
By the way,
if you're at all worried

21:51.103 --> 21:52.403
about working with me--

21:52.437 --> 21:54.372
Mo, I'm not.

21:54.406 --> 21:56.240
Because whatever
my shortcomings last time,

21:56.275 --> 22:00.044
I intend for things to go
perfectly from here on out.

22:00.078 --> 22:01.546
So, if there is--

22:01.580 --> 22:03.781
Gale, you're great.

22:03.815 --> 22:05.049
Seriously.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.384
I just--

22:06.418 --> 22:08.986
However you like
things to be done

22:09.021 --> 22:11.856
is exactly how we
are gonna do them.

22:11.890 --> 22:13.157
Period.

22:14.359 --> 22:15.660
From here on out.

22:15.694 --> 22:19.397
So, uh...

22:19.431 --> 22:21.098
please teach me.

22:27.839 --> 22:28.906
Okay.

It's good to see you.

23:53.959 --> 23:55.860
Mr. Fring.

23:55.894 --> 23:57.428
Wow. This is, uh--

23:57.462 --> 23:58.896
I should have called first.

23:58.930 --> 24:00.898
I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

24:00.932 --> 24:03.367
No. No, not at all.

24:03.402 --> 24:04.602
Please come in.

24:07.272 --> 24:09.407
Can I offer you something?
Crème de Menthe?

24:09.441 --> 24:12.410
Oh, no. No, thank you.

24:12.444 --> 24:14.945
I'm sorry
for the inconvenience.

24:14.980 --> 24:18.582
Oh, no, no.
It's no inconvenience.

24:21.053 --> 24:24.055
I need to talk to you
about something...

24:24.089 --> 24:25.356
something rather pressing.

24:29.661 --> 24:32.997
If push came to shove,
I was wondering

24:33.031 --> 24:36.967
how soon you might be able
to take over the lab yourself.

24:37.002 --> 24:39.470
You and an assistant.

24:39.504 --> 24:40.971
Why would--

24:43.175 --> 24:45.910
Why would push come to shove?

24:45.944 --> 24:47.478
Has Walter ever talked to you

24:47.512 --> 24:48.879
about why he got into

24:48.914 --> 24:50.181
this particular line of work?

24:51.316 --> 24:52.983
Uh...

24:53.018 --> 24:54.685
I guess I assumed
it was because

24:54.720 --> 24:55.886
it pays so well.

24:55.921 --> 24:58.489
Oh, it is, but specifically.

24:58.523 --> 25:01.625
Has he ever spoken to you
about his health problems?

25:03.695 --> 25:06.163
Oh. I'm not surprised.

25:06.198 --> 25:07.898
He's a very private person.

25:09.234 --> 25:12.436
What exactly are
his health problems?

25:12.471 --> 25:13.904
He's dying of cancer.

25:15.273 --> 25:17.541
It is why he does this,

25:17.576 --> 25:18.876
to provide for his family,

25:18.910 --> 25:20.111
which he has accomplished.

25:20.145 --> 25:22.279
They will never want
for anything.

25:22.314 --> 25:23.748
He's seen to that.

25:26.852 --> 25:29.053
Well...

25:29.087 --> 25:31.889
how long does he have?

25:31.923 --> 25:34.525
That is very much the question.

25:34.559 --> 25:36.460
He does not want
to talk about it,

25:36.495 --> 25:38.963
and every time
I bring it up with him--

25:38.997 --> 25:41.132
Hmm.

25:41.166 --> 25:44.201
I don't know
that he's fully accepted

25:44.236 --> 25:45.770
the reality of it.

25:47.139 --> 25:49.073
And not to sound
cold-blooded,

25:49.107 --> 25:51.475
but I am running
a business here.

25:51.510 --> 25:53.043
No, I-- I understand.

25:53.078 --> 25:54.445
I have...

25:54.479 --> 25:56.213
a very large investment
in this.

25:56.248 --> 25:57.448
There is so much overhead

25:57.482 --> 25:59.383
that I can't afford
to shut down,

25:59.418 --> 26:01.185
not even for a week.

26:01.219 --> 26:04.355
So you understand my concern

26:04.389 --> 26:07.558
and my desire for continuity?

26:07.592 --> 26:09.360
I do, absolutely.

26:09.394 --> 26:11.395
Now, I intend to keep Walter on

26:11.430 --> 26:13.964
as long as he wants,

26:13.999 --> 26:17.768
assuming he's
physically up to it.

26:17.803 --> 26:21.138
But as he cannot or will not

26:21.173 --> 26:24.108
tell me how long that might be,

26:24.142 --> 26:28.813
I must prepare for
the worst-case scenario.

26:29.848 --> 26:31.782
The worst-case scenario.

26:36.888 --> 26:38.856
Uh...

26:38.890 --> 26:42.159
I suppose if we had...

26:42.194 --> 26:45.162
at least a few more
cooks together...

26:45.197 --> 26:47.231
You don't think
you're ready now?

26:48.800 --> 26:52.670
Well, he is such a...

26:54.539 --> 26:55.606
a master.

26:56.842 --> 26:58.342
There's always more
for me to learn.

27:01.346 --> 27:06.417
But I'm thinking
that if we had...

27:06.451 --> 27:10.454
say, one or two more cooks?

27:15.527 --> 27:18.095
One more...

27:18.129 --> 27:19.330
I guess, would do it.

27:19.364 --> 27:20.364
I suppose.

27:21.933 --> 27:23.467
I believe in you, Gale.

27:25.770 --> 27:27.438
I know that when
the time comes,

27:27.472 --> 27:29.139
you will be ready.

27:43.335 --> 27:44.435
What's up?

27:51.643 --> 27:52.943
Walt?
Hmm.

27:52.978 --> 27:55.212
Is there, um...

27:59.217 --> 28:00.918
any particular trick

28:00.952 --> 28:03.287
to purging the catalyst bed?

28:05.557 --> 28:07.858
No, it's pretty
straightforward.

28:07.892 --> 28:10.327
I'll show you
when we get there.

28:36.354 --> 28:37.655
Yeah.

28:37.689 --> 28:39.289
Tell him I'm in conference.

28:48.533 --> 28:50.100
Can't you see
I'm in conference?

28:50.135 --> 28:51.568
I'm looking to find
a client of yours.

28:51.603 --> 28:54.271
I was hoping you could
help me out with an address.

28:54.305 --> 28:55.739
Which client?

28:55.774 --> 28:58.242
Jesse Pinkman.

28:58.276 --> 29:00.044
Jesse Pinkman in the phone
book Jesse Pinkman.

29:00.078 --> 29:03.013
Hmm. How would one
track him down?

29:03.048 --> 29:04.114
I wonder.

29:07.986 --> 29:09.319
You're still here.

29:09.354 --> 29:10.888
I need your full
attention, Saul.

29:10.922 --> 29:13.257
Jesse Pinkman
current whereabouts.

29:13.291 --> 29:15.359
The sooner you tell me,
the sooner you can get back

29:15.393 --> 29:17.261
to whatever the hell
this is exactly.

29:17.295 --> 29:19.863
What am I, eight-grade hall monitor?
"Current whereabouts."

29:19.898 --> 29:22.299
Let me tell you
something, Mike-- Whoa.

29:22.333 --> 29:24.868
You are good right there.

29:26.905 --> 29:28.806
Now, let's both
get comfortable.

29:33.111 --> 29:35.546
Now, when I say
I'm looking for Pinkman,

29:35.580 --> 29:37.848
we both know why, don't we?

29:37.882 --> 29:39.717
And you pretending otherwise

29:39.751 --> 29:40.918
only wastes my time

29:40.952 --> 29:42.653
and serves to annoy me.

29:43.988 --> 29:45.456
Mike, uh,

29:45.490 --> 29:48.058
there are rules
to this lawyer thing.

29:48.093 --> 29:49.293
Is that right?

29:49.327 --> 29:51.195
Yeah.

29:51.229 --> 29:53.097
Attorney-client privilege.
That's a big one.

29:53.131 --> 29:55.299
And that's something
I provide for you.

29:55.333 --> 29:57.534
So if I give up Pinkman, well,

29:57.569 --> 29:59.236
then you're gonna be asking

29:59.270 --> 30:01.071
"Old Saul gives 'em up
pretty easy.

30:01.106 --> 30:02.873
What's to keep him
from giving me up?"

30:02.907 --> 30:05.776
You see? So then
where's the trust?

30:05.810 --> 30:10.380
I trust the hole in the desert
I'd leave you in.

30:12.083 --> 30:14.251
Yeah, it's an argument.

30:15.587 --> 30:17.688
So...

30:17.722 --> 30:21.725
don't make me beat you
till your legs don't work.

30:21.760 --> 30:23.861
Now tell me where to find him.

30:23.895 --> 30:26.196
You know it's the right thing.

30:31.069 --> 30:32.970
I can't tell you, Mike.

30:33.004 --> 30:35.606
All right, I--

30:35.640 --> 30:38.075
Look, if I was to tell you,

30:38.109 --> 30:40.744
I just-- I couldn't
live with myself.

30:40.779 --> 30:42.112
I'm sorry.

30:43.715 --> 30:44.948
Hmm.

30:44.983 --> 30:46.817
But who's to say I didn't write

30:46.851 --> 30:49.052
the address down
in my day planner?

30:49.087 --> 30:53.056
Or on a scratch piece
of paper somewhere?

30:53.091 --> 30:55.592
Who's to say I didn't
write down a location

30:55.627 --> 30:58.262
strictly for my own
professional use?

31:00.698 --> 31:04.701
Do not touch
anything on my desk.

31:04.736 --> 31:07.671
I'm gonna leave the room,
make myself a Nescafé.

31:25.423 --> 31:27.424
I'm just looking out
for you, that's all.

31:27.458 --> 31:29.493
Like a mother hen.

31:29.527 --> 31:31.161
Believe me,

31:31.196 --> 31:33.263
money laundering
ain't what it used to be.

31:33.298 --> 31:34.832
God, do I miss the '80s.

31:34.866 --> 31:36.700
Wasting your time.

31:36.734 --> 31:39.303
I'm buying the car wash.
End of story.

31:39.337 --> 31:42.306
Well, one look at this place,
you're gonna fall in love, so--

31:58.223 --> 32:00.691
Huh? Was I right?

32:00.725 --> 32:01.992
Where else are you gonna find

32:02.026 --> 32:04.161
a cash-only business
that's this much fun?

32:04.195 --> 32:05.729
Unless we're talking
massage parlors,

32:05.763 --> 32:08.498
and I don't see it.

32:08.533 --> 32:09.666
Shall we?

32:16.507 --> 32:18.542
You ever actually
play laser tag?

32:19.978 --> 32:22.446
It's good cardio.
Plus you get to shoot at kids.

32:32.423 --> 32:34.958
You got your bumper cars
over there down that way.

32:34.993 --> 32:36.360
Got your arcade right here.

32:36.394 --> 32:38.128
All the latest video games.

32:38.162 --> 32:39.830
Snack bar is over there.

32:39.864 --> 32:42.099
Nothing stopping you from
selling beer to the parents.

32:42.133 --> 32:43.967
That's a whole new
revenue stream.

32:44.002 --> 32:45.502
All right, enough.

32:45.536 --> 32:47.170
We're good.

32:48.773 --> 32:50.140
Holy Christ.

32:50.174 --> 32:51.608
We're good?

32:51.643 --> 32:53.510
This constitutes good
where you're from?

32:53.544 --> 32:55.379
My car is bugged.

32:55.413 --> 32:56.613
I said maybe-- maybe--

32:56.648 --> 32:57.948
I'm being followed.

32:57.982 --> 33:00.050
What the hell have
you gotten me into?

33:00.084 --> 33:01.418
My very own P.I.

33:01.452 --> 33:02.653
is threatening
to break my legs.

33:02.687 --> 33:04.521
That's like Thomas Magnum
threatening

33:04.555 --> 33:07.257
that little prissy guy
with the mustache.

33:07.292 --> 33:08.458
Over and above.

33:08.493 --> 33:10.761
Service-wise,
is is over and above.

33:10.795 --> 33:12.696
You and I survive this,

33:12.730 --> 33:14.932
oh, I'm seriously
rethinking my pricing.

33:14.966 --> 33:16.566
Yeah. And that goes

33:16.601 --> 33:17.935
double for you, Hip-Hop.

33:19.270 --> 33:21.038
My guy's no dummy.
Right?

33:21.072 --> 33:23.307
So I give us maybe 24 hours

33:23.341 --> 33:25.509
before he figures out
that address goes nowhere.

33:25.543 --> 33:28.211
You guys do your thing.
Make it snappy.

33:28.246 --> 33:31.315
I'll go see if they have
Tetris or something.

33:39.624 --> 33:41.425
How are you holding up?

33:44.562 --> 33:45.696
You?

33:46.998 --> 33:48.732
I got my old job back.

33:48.766 --> 33:51.535
At least until they kill me
and Gale takes over.

33:52.537 --> 33:55.005
He's their boy, huh?

33:55.039 --> 33:57.374
He's their boy.

33:57.408 --> 33:59.109
How long you think you've got?

34:01.045 --> 34:03.347
Well, he asks
a lot of questions

34:03.381 --> 34:04.982
about the cooking process.

34:05.016 --> 34:07.050
I try to be
as vague as possible,

34:07.085 --> 34:09.518
but I got that guy
Victor watching me,

34:09.554 --> 34:11.188
listening to every word I say.

34:13.024 --> 34:14.858
Maybe the only thing
that's saving me

34:14.891 --> 34:17.594
is Gale's fastidiousness.

34:17.628 --> 34:19.563
Once he feels confident

34:19.597 --> 34:22.032
that he knows
my entire method...

34:28.272 --> 34:29.606
So what do we do?

34:34.078 --> 34:35.712
You know what we do.

34:44.522 --> 34:46.523
There's got to be
some other way.

34:49.092 --> 34:52.696
Maybe it's better for you
to just go to the cops.

34:52.730 --> 34:54.364
All right?

34:54.399 --> 34:56.900
I mean, I can't believe
I'm saying that at all,

34:56.934 --> 35:00.270
but for your family?

35:00.304 --> 35:02.806
The DEA would love you.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.508
All the shit
you could tell them?

35:04.542 --> 35:07.544
Federal Witness Protection,
that's a good deal.

35:07.578 --> 35:09.746
As for me,
I'll hit the road, yo.

35:09.781 --> 35:11.982
I mean-- I'll make it.

35:14.452 --> 35:16.620
We had a--
We had a good run.

35:18.790 --> 35:20.690
But it's over.

35:23.628 --> 35:25.095
Never the DEA.

35:28.132 --> 35:29.966
The cook can't stop.

35:30.001 --> 35:31.902
That's the one thing
I'm certain of.

35:31.936 --> 35:34.704
Production cannot stop.

35:34.739 --> 35:36.173
Gus can't afford to.

35:37.608 --> 35:42.179
So if I'm the only chemist
that he's got,

35:42.213 --> 35:44.281
then I've got leverage.

35:44.315 --> 35:45.949
And leverage keeps me alive.

35:45.983 --> 35:48.251
It keeps you alive, too.
I think I can see to that.

35:50.054 --> 35:53.490
If I'm the only chemist
that he's got.

36:02.600 --> 36:07.104
I-- I can't do it,
Mr. White.

36:09.574 --> 36:12.742
Like you said, I'm--

36:12.777 --> 36:14.177
I'm not a...

36:16.347 --> 36:17.614
I can't do it.

36:24.355 --> 36:25.422
I'll do it.

36:28.526 --> 36:30.127
I'm gonna--

36:30.161 --> 36:32.395
I'm gonna need your help.

36:32.430 --> 36:33.463
I mean, they're watching me

36:33.498 --> 36:34.898
day and night.

36:34.932 --> 36:37.334
They never leave me alone
with Gale, not for a moment.

36:37.368 --> 36:39.836
Hell, I don't even know
where the man lives.

36:41.506 --> 36:42.672
He's not in the phone book.

36:42.707 --> 36:44.007
I can't find him
on the Internet.

36:44.041 --> 36:46.276
I can't do it in the lab.

36:46.310 --> 36:47.811
Victor's always there.

36:50.648 --> 36:53.083
But if I could just...

36:53.117 --> 36:55.852
shake Victor for even
an hour one night,

36:55.887 --> 36:58.889
I think then that...

36:58.923 --> 37:01.224
I may be able to...

37:04.295 --> 37:05.896
make it look like an accident.

37:09.333 --> 37:11.501
There's got to be
some other way.

37:13.304 --> 37:14.471
I'm all ears.

37:15.740 --> 37:18.775
But when it comes down
to you and me versus him--

37:18.809 --> 37:20.343
I'm sorry,

37:20.378 --> 37:22.245
I'm truly sorry--

37:23.781 --> 37:25.448
but it's gonna be him.

37:27.351 --> 37:31.488
You are the only edge
that I've got,

37:31.522 --> 37:33.990
as long as they don't know
that you're in town.

37:34.025 --> 37:35.892
But I need you to track him.

37:35.927 --> 37:37.894
Get me his address,

37:37.929 --> 37:39.496
and I'll do the rest.

37:46.470 --> 37:49.839
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.

37:55.313 --> 37:56.846
Are you gonna save mine?

39:08.867 --> 39:10.267
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:10.301 --> 39:12.202
Please tell me you found him.

39:12.237 --> 39:16.807
<i>6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard,
Apartment 6.</i>

39:20.845 --> 39:21.979
<i>You there?</i>

39:22.013 --> 39:24.147
Uh, yeah.

39:24.182 --> 39:27.284
6353 Juan Tabo,
Number 6. Got it.

39:30.855 --> 39:32.456
He's home?

39:32.490 --> 39:33.857
<i>Yep.</i>

39:33.892 --> 39:36.793
Anyone watching the place?

39:36.828 --> 39:40.664
<i>No. Looks pretty much
wide open.</i>

39:40.698 --> 39:42.666
<i>When are you gonna do it?</i>

39:47.071 --> 39:48.906
Tonight.

39:48.940 --> 39:50.507
Once it gets dark.

39:54.379 --> 39:57.614
<i>Don't do this, Mr. White.</i>

39:57.649 --> 39:59.650
<i>Please.</i>

39:59.684 --> 40:01.184
<i>Go to the cops.</i>

40:33.751 --> 40:34.952
We got a problem.

40:34.986 --> 40:37.854
Some kind of chemical
leaking in your lab.

40:37.889 --> 40:39.723
You gotta come with me.

40:43.361 --> 40:45.262
I'll, uh-- I'll follow you.

40:45.296 --> 40:46.964
They tell me to bring you,
I bring you.

40:46.998 --> 40:48.598
Come on, get in the car.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.601
I don't know if it's
a barrel leak or what,

41:57.635 --> 42:00.103
but you got something
mighty stinky down there.

42:04.842 --> 42:06.710
After you.

42:08.880 --> 42:11.548
Walter, the sooner you
figure out what this is,

42:11.582 --> 42:13.350
the sooner we all go home.

42:18.689 --> 42:20.023
Please don't do this.

42:21.292 --> 42:22.859
Mike...

42:22.894 --> 42:24.895
you don't have to do this.

42:27.131 --> 42:30.333
Yeah. Unfortunately, I do,
Walter.

42:30.368 --> 42:32.169
Downstairs.

42:32.203 --> 42:34.571
I'll cook--
I'll cook for free.

42:34.605 --> 42:35.939
And there won't be
any more trouble.

42:35.973 --> 42:36.973
I promise you.

42:37.008 --> 42:38.842
Okay, if I could
just talk to Gus,

42:38.876 --> 42:40.210
I know I can make
him understand.

42:40.244 --> 42:41.778
If I can talk to Gus--
No. Walter?

42:41.813 --> 42:43.080
...I can convince him, okay?

42:43.114 --> 42:44.748
Just let me, please--
Please.

42:44.782 --> 42:46.750
Please let me talk to him!
Shut up!

42:46.784 --> 42:47.918
Shut up.

42:50.054 --> 42:52.155
I can't do it.

42:52.190 --> 42:53.690
I'm sorry.

42:57.061 --> 42:58.962
I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.

42:58.996 --> 43:01.698
Okay? Like you said,
he's the problem.

43:01.732 --> 43:04.334
He's always been the problem.
Without him, we would--

43:04.368 --> 43:06.803
And he's--
he's in town, all right?

43:06.838 --> 43:09.539
He's not in Virginia or wherever
the hell you're looking for him.

43:09.574 --> 43:11.374
He's right here in Albuquerque,

43:11.409 --> 43:12.976
and I can take you to him.

43:13.010 --> 43:14.978
I'll take you right to him.

43:15.012 --> 43:16.079
Huh?

43:18.883 --> 43:20.350
What do you say?
Where is he?

43:20.384 --> 43:21.885
Right now.
You give me an address.

43:21.919 --> 43:23.820
I-- I don't--
He moves.

43:23.855 --> 43:26.223
He moves around,
but if you let me call him--

43:26.257 --> 43:27.557
No, no, please.

43:27.592 --> 43:29.426
No, I just-- My phone.

43:29.460 --> 43:31.895
I'll just--
It's just my phone.

43:31.929 --> 43:34.431
I'll call him,
and I'll have him meet me.

43:34.465 --> 43:35.999
All right? Okay?

43:37.101 --> 43:38.101
Okay?

44:18.376 --> 44:19.409
Did you do it?

44:21.679 --> 44:23.113
<i>Mr. White?</i>

44:24.549 --> 44:25.849
<i>Did you do it?</i>

44:27.218 --> 44:28.852
No, I didn't do it.

44:28.886 --> 44:30.987
<i>I can't now.</i>

44:32.790 --> 44:33.990
<i>It's gonna have to be you.</i>

44:34.025 --> 44:36.426
What? No way, man.

44:36.460 --> 44:38.662
<i>Listen to me.
You're closer than we are.</i>

44:38.696 --> 44:40.297
You'll have about
a 20-minute lead.

44:40.331 --> 44:42.365
They've got me at the laundry,
and they're going to kill me.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.801
Jesse, do it now!
Do it-- Do it fast!

44:44.835 --> 44:46.236
<i>Do it now! Jesse!</i>

44:46.270 --> 44:47.704
Oh, my God.

44:52.343 --> 44:53.643
Huh.

44:54.745 --> 44:57.480
Just what the hell
was that exactly?

44:57.515 --> 44:59.149
You might want to hold off.

44:59.183 --> 45:01.851
Yeah? Why?

45:01.886 --> 45:04.821
Because your boss
is gonna need me.

45:06.090 --> 45:10.860
6353 Juan Tabo, Apartment 6.

45:15.266 --> 45:16.299
Yeah.

46:02.780 --> 46:04.147
Hi.

46:04.181 --> 46:05.248
How can I help you?

46:11.489 --> 46:13.423
Take whatever you want.

46:15.259 --> 46:17.761
I have money.
I have--

46:17.795 --> 46:19.829
I got a lot of money.

46:21.499 --> 46:23.366
I have--

46:23.401 --> 46:25.302
Um...

46:25.336 --> 46:26.436
You--

46:30.441 --> 46:33.910
Please don't do this.

46:35.579 --> 46:37.180
You don't-- You--

46:40.084 --> 46:41.117
You--

46:42.520 --> 46:44.487
You don't have to do this.
