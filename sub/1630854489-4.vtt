04:01.625 --> 04:02.875
Don't worry about me.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.250
LUNGA, WHERE ARE YOU?

06:59.708 --> 07:00.541
No, not yet.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.666
I thought I should touch base with you.

08:04.541 --> 08:07.583
Now I'm stuck gardening, grounded,
'cause my mom's angry with me.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.375
You know what kind of person Puleng is.

11:39.125 --> 11:42.541
Think he'll do it? I mean,
They are his parents, after all.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.166
I-- I don't know.

19:17.583 --> 19:20.375
You're working on my nerves.
Your parents are criminals.

28:26.875 --> 28:28.791
How come, Fikile, how come?

28:28.875 --> 28:30.416
I will go talk to Matla.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.791
Even if there's
a little truth to what you say…

28:47.250 --> 28:49.916
But, Fikile,
what were you thinking, my child?

29:01.250 --> 29:02.875
Regardless of what you've done…

29:18.333 --> 29:20.250
What's up with you and Thandeka?

29:22.958 --> 29:24.041
It's nothing.

29:31.583 --> 29:32.791
My child…

29:39.166 --> 29:40.916
Or do you want us to go together?

29:47.375 --> 29:48.375
You'll be late.

35:57.083 --> 35:58.666
Go on, right now.

37:30.291 --> 37:31.958
You're meeting them where?

37:46.000 --> 37:49.708
All right, my child, I'll see
what my team can come up with.

37:49.791 --> 37:50.916
-Okay.
-Is that all?

37:57.708 --> 38:01.250
How will I get that amount
of money at such short notice?

38:14.541 --> 38:17.250
Yo, I am proud of you, my child.

38:47.916 --> 38:48.875
Go well.

42:08.875 --> 42:11.791
Karabo, how did you know that I work here?

48:41.791 --> 48:44.708
Tell me the truth.
What are we doing here?

48:47.041 --> 48:48.666
I just want to spend time with you.

48:52.166 --> 48:54.250
-I can leave if you are busy.
-No, no, no.

49:10.875 --> 49:13.583
Forgive me, Karabo.
Something came up.

49:13.666 --> 49:16.958
But don't leave,
buy yourself some coffee or dessert.
