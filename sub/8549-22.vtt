07:29.382 --> 07:32.419

07:48.602 --> 07:50.470
I'VE GOTTEN ABOUT 8 KILOMETERS.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.139
5.33 MILES.

07:57.444 --> 08:00.848
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I HEARD
A NOISE BEHIND ME.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.155
I TURNED AROUND...

08:08.221 --> 08:09.557
I TURNED AROUND,
AND THERE,

08:09.623 --> 08:11.959
10 FEET TALL,

08:12.025 --> 08:13.827
WAS A GRIZZLY BEAR!

08:26.574 --> 08:29.209
THAT BEAR
JUST GRINNED AT ME.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.179
HE PULLED OUT
THAT 8-INCH HUNK OF STEEL

08:32.245 --> 08:34.548
AND TOSSED IT LIKE IT WAS
A TOOTHPICK.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.017

SUFFERING.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.752

09:19.026 --> 09:20.928

WELL, YOU SEE,
THERE'S A...

10:00.300 --> 10:02.035
THERE'S A REASON
FOR THAT.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.637
OH?

10:03.704 --> 10:07.641
SEE, I HAVEN'T BEEN
TOTALLY HONEST WITH YOU.

10:07.708 --> 10:11.645
UH, MY NAME ISN'T
JIMMY HOLMES,

10:11.712 --> 10:14.948
AND--AND I DON'T

WHO YOU ARE,

10:43.677 --> 10:45.913
OR WHAT YOU WANT.
BUT THIS GAME'S OVER.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.882
I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.
I'M THEIR FATHER.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.183
NEWS FLASH, BUDDY BOY.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.786
THEIR FATHER WAS KILLED
IN THE KOREAN WAR.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.487
THAT'S RIGHT. I WAS.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.655
ALRIGHT.
YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.657
NO. LISTEN.

10:57.725 --> 11:00.027
I CAN PROVE
I'M THEIR FATHER.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.430
I'M WAITING.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.733
UH, HARRIETTE'S
FAVORITE COOKIES

11:05.799 --> 11:06.767

11:06.834 --> 11:08.468
WHOSE WASN'T?

11:08.535 --> 11:12.205
UH, RACHEL HAD A PET GOLDFISH
NAMED CHUBBY.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.441
LUCKY GUESS.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.844
THEIR MOTHER'S NAME
WAS DARLENE.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.712
HARRIETTE AND RACHEL
WERE BOTH DELIVERED

11:18.779 --> 11:20.647
AT REGIS MEMORIAL
HOSPITAL

11:20.714 --> 11:23.016
BY DR. THOMAS
BRADSHAW.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.285
HARRIETTE HAS
A SMALL SCAR

11:25.352 --> 11:27.988
ABOVE HER LEFT KNEE FROM WHEN
SHE FELL OFF HER...

11:28.055 --> 11:30.190
TRICYCLE.
TRICYCLE.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.430
UH...

11:39.566 --> 11:42.903
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE. UH...

11:42.970 --> 11:44.404
LET'S SAY FOR
THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT

11:44.471 --> 11:49.642
THAT SOMEHOW YOU ARE HARRIETTE
AND RACHEL'S FATHER.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.112
WHY DID THEY THINK
THAT YOU WERE DEAD?

11:54.214 --> 11:56.016
I WAS, UH...

11:56.083 --> 11:59.619
I WAS ONLY 18
WHEN I MARRIED DARLENE,

11:59.686 --> 12:03.957
AND WE HAD PROBLEMS
FROM THE GET-GO.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.159
SHE THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP
IF WE HAD KIDS,

12:06.226 --> 12:09.997
BUT IN LOTS OF WAYS,
IT JUST MADE THINGS WORSE.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.232
I STUCK IT OUT
FOR FIVE YEARS,

12:12.299 --> 12:18.671
BUT WHEN HARRIETTE WAS 3
AND RACHEL WAS 1, I...

12:18.738 --> 12:20.740
I BAILED OUT.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.943
YOU ABANDONED THEM.

12:24.644 --> 12:28.882
I SENT MONEY,
AND I CALLED.

12:28.949 --> 12:33.053
AND ONE DAY DARLENE
TOLD ME TO STOP CALLING.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.155
SHE SAID SHE HAD TOLD
HARRIETTE AND RACHEL

12:35.222 --> 12:38.491
THAT THEIR FATHER HAD BEEN
SHOT DOWN OVER KOREA.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.263
WELL, WHY DID SHE
DO THAT?

12:43.330 --> 12:46.199
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T
WANT HER LITTLE GIRLS

12:46.266 --> 12:48.301
GROWING UP THINKING
THAT THEIR FATHER

12:48.368 --> 12:49.837
HAD RUN OUT ON THEM,

12:49.903 --> 12:51.738
AND THAT HURT.

12:51.805 --> 12:56.376
I MEAN, THAT...

12:56.443 --> 12:59.679
WELL, IT'S TOUGH FOR ME
TO SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.915
NO MARRIAGE IS EASY.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.951
AT TIMES I'VE WANTED
TO PULL MY HAIR OUT.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.819
I CAN SEE THAT.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.057
I'M SORRY, CARL.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.392
I'M--I'M A LITTLE
NERVOUS HERE, YOU KNOW.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.894
WELL, THE POINT IS

13:13.961 --> 13:15.228
I DIDN'T RUN AWAY.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.999
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I WISH I HADN'T EITHER.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.137
WELL, WHY ARE YOU
HERE NOW?

13:25.238 --> 13:27.307
I WANTED TO SEE
MY KIDS.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.777
I WANTED TO GIVE MY GRANDSON
A PIGGYBACK RIDE.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.813
I WANTED--I...

13:33.881 --> 13:36.583
WELL, I'LL BE LEAVING
TOMORROW,

13:36.649 --> 13:38.051
AND I WON'T BOTHER YOU
EVER AGAIN.

13:38.118 --> 13:41.421
WAIT. YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO TELL THEM

13:41.488 --> 13:42.923
WHO YOU ARE?

13:45.792 --> 13:47.961
CARL...
I CAN'T.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.730
I WANT THEM
TO REMEMBER ME

13:50.797 --> 13:52.532
AS A HERO

13:52.599 --> 13:54.334
INSTEAD
OF A HEEL.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.606
I SEE.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.381
BUT YOU KNOW, JIMMY,

14:08.448 --> 14:09.482
IT SEEMS TO ME

14:09.549 --> 14:12.485
THAT YOU'RE STILL ONLY
THINKING ABOUT YOURSELF.

14:24.998 --> 14:28.301
* MONEY, MONEY,
MONEY, MONEY *

14:28.368 --> 14:29.669
* MONEY *

14:29.736 --> 14:31.338
* MONEY, MONEY,
MONEY, MON-- *

14:31.404 --> 14:32.605
AAH!

14:46.319 --> 14:48.655
GREETINGS, MY LITTLE
GUMMI BEAR.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.925
GOT ANY HONEY, HONEY?

14:54.527 --> 14:56.396
UH, STEVE...

14:56.463 --> 14:58.598
WHY ARE YOU
WEARING A BEAR RUG?

15:02.302 --> 15:03.370
WELL...

15:15.715 --> 15:17.317
LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO,

15:17.384 --> 15:19.953
I WAS RIDING MY BIKE
DOWN OAK STREET.

15:21.188 --> 15:24.357
AND SUDDENLY, I HEARD
A NOISE BEHIND ME.

15:29.829 --> 15:31.531
SO I TURNED AROUND,

15:31.598 --> 15:34.734
AND RIGHT THERE, NEXT TO
THE ZUCKERMANS' ROSEBUSH,

15:34.801 --> 15:37.137
WAS A GRIZZLY BEAR.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.174
WHY ARE YOU
COPYING JIMMY?

15:42.709 --> 15:46.013
I COULDN'T HELP NOTICING THAT
WHENEVER YOU LOOKED AT JIMMY,

15:46.079 --> 15:49.082
YOUR FACE WAS FILLED
WITH ADMIRATION.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.451
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT, TOO...

15:52.986 --> 15:55.288
SO I THOUGHT
I'D SHOW YOU

15:55.355 --> 15:58.291
THAT I, TOO, CAN WALK
ON THE WILD SIDE.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.234
IT WOULD
REALLY IMPRESS ME

16:07.300 --> 16:09.102
IF YOU'D
JUST WALK HOME.

16:11.438 --> 16:12.605
OKAY.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.707
UH, BUT DON'T
FORGET THIS.

16:25.918 --> 16:29.056
[IMITATING
HORSE'S WHINNY]

16:31.024 --> 16:32.092
UH-OH.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.826
WHAT, WHAT,
WHAT, WHAT?

16:33.893 --> 16:35.795
WE'VE COME TO
A RIVER.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.730
YOU'LL HAVE
TO LEAD ME ACROSS.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.107
RICHIE.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.342
PLEASE LEAVE
POOR MR. HOLMES ALONE.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.445
WE'RE HAVING FUN,
RIGHT?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.181
RIGHT, PARTNER.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.415
BUT I'M AFRAID
IT'S TIME

16:55.482 --> 16:58.585
FOR SILVER TO GALLOP
INTO THE SUNSET.

16:59.786 --> 17:00.887
OH, COME ON.

17:00.953 --> 17:03.523
I'LL MOSEY BACK
THIS WAY AGAIN.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.392
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.197
I'M GOING
TO MISS YOU, TOO.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.139
HEY. COME ON.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.341
GET ALONG, LITTLE DOGIE.
GO ON.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.548
TAXI JUST PULLED UP.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.683
WELL, THAT'S FOR ME.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.920
HARRIETTE, RACHEL,

17:33.986 --> 17:35.755
I WANT TO THANK YOU

17:35.822 --> 17:37.790
FOR MAKING ME
FEEL SO WELCOME.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.160
OH, JIMMY,
YOU ARE WELCOME.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.295
CAN'T YOU STAY
ONE MORE NIGHT?

17:42.362 --> 17:44.731
WE'LL BE HEARTBROKEN
IF YOU LEAVE.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.340
I REALLY WISH I COULD.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.214
LAST CHANCE, JIMMY.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.457
HARRIETTE, RACHEL...

18:12.759 --> 18:15.228
MY NAME ISN'T JIMMY HOLMES.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.467
IT'S JIMMY BAINES.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.872
BAINES?

18:27.807 --> 18:29.742
I'M YOUR FATHER.

18:49.662 --> 18:50.863
HARRIETTE.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.602
ARE YOU OKAY?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.406
ARE YOU?

19:00.773 --> 19:02.375
NO.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.547
HE DUMPED US, RACH.

19:09.682 --> 19:13.152
NOW HE COMES WALTZING BACK
INTO OUR LIVES.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.921
WHAT DOES HE WANT
FROM US?

19:20.593 --> 19:22.862
I THINK HE WANTS US
TO FORGIVE HIM.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.699
WELL, I CAN'T FORGIVE.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.870
I FEEL CHEATED.

19:30.937 --> 19:33.573
SO MANY TIMES I'VE WATCHED
LAURA AND CARL,

19:33.640 --> 19:36.743
AND...I'VE WISHED
WITH ALL MY HEART

19:36.809 --> 19:39.546
I COULD HAVE HAD THOSE KIND
OF MOMENTS WITH MY FATHER.

19:41.681 --> 19:45.218
HARRIETTE, HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE WALKED OUT ON US,

19:45.285 --> 19:47.820
BUT HE'S HERE TRYING TO MAKE
AMENDS FOR THAT NOW,

19:49.289 --> 19:52.191
AND IF WE DON'T MEET HIM
HALFWAY,

19:52.259 --> 19:55.628
THEN WE'LL BE MAKING
THE SAME MISTAKE HE DID.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.030
I KNOW.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.832
BUT THE THING
THAT BOTHERS ME THE MOST

19:59.899 --> 20:03.169
IS HOW COULD THE MAN
JUST LEAVE LIKE THAT

20:03.236 --> 20:05.772
AND NEVER GIVE US
ANOTHER THOUGHT?

20:08.841 --> 20:10.477
I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU.

20:11.578 --> 20:15.315
I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.952
HARRIETTE, I KNOW
WHAT I DID WAS WRONG,

20:20.019 --> 20:22.221
AND I HATE MYSELF
FOR IT,

20:22.289 --> 20:25.024
SO I CAN UNDERSTAND

20:25.091 --> 20:27.394
IF YOU HATE ME, TOO.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.331
WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW--

20:31.398 --> 20:36.736
NO--WHAT I NEED
FOR YOU TO KNOW

20:36.803 --> 20:39.306
IS THAT EVEN THOUGH
WE WEREN'T TOGETHER,

20:39.372 --> 20:41.774
I NEVER STOPPED
LOVING YOU.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.446
HERE.

20:50.149 --> 20:52.785
YOU REMEMBER THIS?

20:52.852 --> 20:55.455
YOU GAVE THIS TO ME

20:55.522 --> 20:57.657
WHEN YOU WERE
3 YEARS OLD.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.996
"HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY,
DADDY."

21:05.665 --> 21:06.999
D-A-D-Y.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.903
"I'LL LOVE YOU ALWAYS."

21:12.138 --> 21:13.740
ALWAYS.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.310
WELL, IT'S NICE
THAT YOU KEPT THAT,

21:19.111 --> 21:20.713
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS,

21:20.780 --> 21:23.049
YOU WEREN'T THERE
WHEN WE NEEDED YOU.

21:25.485 --> 21:28.254
I'M HERE NOW.

21:28.321 --> 21:31.591
AND I WANT TO BE
PART OF YOUR LIVES.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.593
THAT'S
ALL I'M ASKING YOU.

21:33.660 --> 21:34.961
PLEASE.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.697
WILL YOU LET ME?

21:39.065 --> 21:40.700
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.

21:47.173 --> 21:48.708
WE COULD TRY.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.348
WE COULD TRY.

22:14.233 --> 22:15.568
DADDY.
