Good luck.
- Come on over.

27:39.591 --> 27:40.725
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

27:40.792 --> 27:42.260
- All right, let's go.
- Can you tell me

27:42.327 --> 27:44.863
{\an3}about what happened that day
and your experience?

27:44.929 --> 27:46.031
- I worked for the Oklahoma
City Fire Department.

27:46.097 --> 27:48.133
{\an1}About 9:02 we heard
the blast and felt it.

27:48.199 --> 27:49.501
It shook the station.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.636
{\an1}When we first arrived on the
scene, it was just chao--

27:51.703 --> 27:53.238
we had people--you know,
you had a lot

27:53.304 --> 27:56.307
of walking wounded running away
from the--from the building.

27:56.374 --> 27:58.843
A police officer was holding
a baby and saying he needed

27:58.910 --> 28:03.815
some help with an infant, and
to this day I don't know why.

28:03.882 --> 28:05.517
I just said,
"Here, I'll take her."

28:05.583 --> 28:07.218
The first thing looking down at
Bailey, really,

28:07.285 --> 28:09.020
{\an1}was just thinking that--
I mean, 'cause I knew

28:09.087 --> 28:12.290
she was already passed,
and just knowing that--

28:12.357 --> 28:14.626
I knew somebody's world
was getting ready

28:14.692 --> 28:17.529
to be turned upside-down today.

28:17.595 --> 28:19.097
- That day I was at work.

28:19.164 --> 28:20.532
I had just started a new job.

28:20.598 --> 28:23.201
{\an3}I could feel the vibration
before I could hear it.

28:23.268 --> 28:25.804
I could see that it
was the building she was in.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.973
My sister and I decided
to go to the local hospitals.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.709
About two minutes later,
my pediatrician comes around

28:31.776 --> 28:34.245
the corner with the priest,

28:34.312 --> 28:37.415
and I knew then
that she was gone.

28:37.482 --> 28:39.417
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

28:39.484 --> 28:40.885
The next day I woke up.

28:40.952 --> 28:43.388
I asked for the newspaper,
and there was that picture

28:43.455 --> 28:46.324
<i>of firefighter Chris Fields</i>
<i>holding Bailey,</i>

28:46.391 --> 28:49.260
<i>and then, like,</i>
<i>two days later I met Chris.</i>

28:49.327 --> 28:52.430
{\an3}And I was just like,
"Thank you," you know?

28:52.497 --> 28:55.500
"Thank you for
caring about her."

28:55.567 --> 28:57.001
- I can't even imagine.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.903
{\an3}- When Bailey was killed,
there was a gentleman

28:58.970 --> 29:02.740
that bought a star in her name,
so in the sky there's

29:02.807 --> 29:04.542
a star named Bailey,
and that would just,

29:04.609 --> 29:07.112
like, represent me holding her.
- Nice.

29:07.178 --> 29:08.847
- And that's what I would like.
- Okay.

29:08.913 --> 29:10.748
{\an1}- I had a two-year-old son
at home,

29:10.815 --> 29:12.117
and that
was part of my struggles.

29:12.183 --> 29:13.918
Anytime I would see my son,

29:13.985 --> 29:15.553
sometimes I would see Bailey.

29:15.620 --> 29:17.889
And that was something
that haunted me for a while.

29:17.956 --> 29:20.558
- [sighs] Yeah.

29:20.625 --> 29:23.061
{\an1}- You know, I was diagnosed
with PTSD,

29:23.128 --> 29:25.763

of it today

29:29.300 --> 29:31.736
{\an1}- You know,
my faith and my family.

29:31.803 --> 29:34.305
- I think we could go
in a direction that brings

29:34.372 --> 29:39.277
{\an3}both of those things
together in a symbolic way.

29:39.344 --> 29:41.279

almost like it was

29:50.054 --> 29:51.422
plucked right out of the sky.

29:51.489 --> 29:53.358
- See, that's exactly
what I wanted.

29:53.424 --> 29:54.492

her memory live on.

Voting is officially open.
[cheers and applause]

36:56.547 --> 36:58.282
- They're very intricate.

36:58.349 --> 37:01.185
- The blacks, the details
in there, like a statue.

37:01.252 --> 37:03.321
- It was fun.
- You kicked ass. Thank you.

37:03.387 --> 37:04.388
- Thank you, sir,
for your service.

37:04.455 --> 37:06.123
- Thank you.

37:06.190 --> 37:07.625
- I voted for Nikki

37:07.692 --> 37:10.127
<i>because every single part</i>
<i>of it is so perfect.</i>

37:10.194 --> 37:11.629
You can see
an expression on the face.

37:11.696 --> 37:14.599
It's gorgeous.

37:14.665 --> 37:15.933
- Got some good depth to it.

37:16.000 --> 37:16.968
- It sort of just
pops out at you.

37:17.034 --> 37:18.369
- Thank you.
- Great work.

37:18.436 --> 37:20.504
- Appreciate it.

37:20.571 --> 37:23.240
- I voted for Drew because
he drew a portal

37:23.307 --> 37:25.776
<i>to a universe,</i>
<i>a galaxy with some hands</i>

37:25.843 --> 37:27.678
<i>delivering a blue star out</i>
<i>of the portal.</i>

37:27.745 --> 37:31.148
Blew me away.

37:31.215 --> 37:33.050
{\an1}- I love the colors
in Drew's tattoo.

37:33.117 --> 37:36.153
- He pulled some super solid
lines by how much his canvas

37:36.220 --> 37:38.689
was moving, but you could see
little hiccups here and there.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.925
- With a jumpy canvas,
that's hard to deal with.

37:40.992 --> 37:44.362
- Nikki's tattoo--it's hard
to look at that tattoo

37:44.428 --> 37:46.130
<i>and find something wrong.</i>
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

37:46.197 --> 37:47.398
<i>- I feel like she could</i>
<i>have gone</i>

37:47.465 --> 37:48.899
<i>a little</i>
<i>bit darker around the neck.</i>

37:48.966 --> 37:50.968
<i>It looked misshapen.</i>
- At the same time, she, like,

37:51.035 --> 37:53.104
went through and added
details in the leaf bits.

37:53.170 --> 37:54.538
<i>It makes it</i>
<i>a lot more readable.</i>

37:54.605 --> 37:57.408
{\an1}They're both so good,
it's gonna come down to one

37:57.475 --> 38:01.646
little tiny mistake, you know?
- Man.

38:01.712 --> 38:05.549
{\an1}- So that was
a rough day for Drew.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.485
{\an3}- I mean, he handled
it pretty well though.

38:07.551 --> 38:09.153
<i>There's a beautiful concept</i>

38:09.220 --> 38:12.456
that fit the area
of her body perfectly.

38:12.523 --> 38:14.258
- Yes.
- But my major issue was

38:14.325 --> 38:18.062
{\an3}where Drew attempted
to do the transparency effect.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.564
<i>- All we see is</i>
<i>criss-crossing lines.</i>

38:20.631 --> 38:22.767
{\an1}If he was having
trouble with it because of

38:22.833 --> 38:24.835
{\an1}his canvas moving,
he should have

38:24.902 --> 38:28.939
<i>abandoned that special effect</i>
<i>and just made it look solid.</i>

38:29.006 --> 38:30.941
- And if we're talking
about special effects,

38:31.008 --> 38:32.510
we have to talk about Nikki's.

38:32.576 --> 38:35.746
<i>She didn't put in those</i>
<i>textures, those rock crumbles.</i>

38:35.813 --> 38:39.684
{\an1}- Nikki needed to exaggerate
those chisel marks

38:39.750 --> 38:44.088
{\an1}in that stone to really
give it that stony effect.

38:44.155 --> 38:48.059
<i>- But I love how dark</i>
<i>and deep the ivy is wrapping</i>

38:48.125 --> 38:51.062
<i>all around the saint,</i>
<i>framing her perfectly.</i>

38:51.128 --> 38:53.197
{\an3}The two tattoos
couldn't be any more different.

38:53.264 --> 38:55.299
- This is a tough one.

38:59.470 --> 39:03.040
{\an3}Oklahoma City, are you
ready to find out who won?

39:03.107 --> 39:04.875
[cheers and applause]

39:04.942 --> 39:08.946
- Guys, if Drew beats Nikki,
he's going to secure his spot

39:09.013 --> 39:12.049
on "Ink Master."
[cheers and applause]

39:13.951 --> 39:17.655
- And the decision
was unanimous.

39:17.722 --> 39:19.356
- [exhales]

39:19.423 --> 39:25.496
- The winner of the Angel
face-off is...

39:25.563 --> 39:27.131
Nikki Simpson.

39:27.198 --> 39:30.234
[cheers and applause]

39:31.902 --> 39:35.439
- This win feels good,
but damn, if Drew had

39:35.506 --> 39:37.775
an easier experience,
I know it would have been

39:37.842 --> 39:39.610
a much harder fight.

39:39.677 --> 39:42.480
Honestly,
it was a pleasure having you.

39:42.546 --> 39:43.948
{\an8}You're an awesome artist.

39:44.014 --> 39:45.249
{\an8}You gotta roll
with the punches,

39:45.316 --> 39:47.384
{\an8}and that's what "Ink Master"
is all about.

39:47.451 --> 39:49.353
{\an3}- It was a delight
getting to watch you tattoo.

39:49.420 --> 39:52.156
- You did so awesome.
- I can't thank y'all enough.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.059
{\an8}I'm still walking away
holding my head high knowing

39:55.126 --> 39:57.762
that I can take on any
challenge that comes my way.

39:57.828 --> 40:00.030
{\an1}- You just did Oklahoma
[bleep] proud, man.

40:00.097 --> 40:01.699
{\an3}- You should be very
proud of your man.

40:01.766 --> 40:03.834
{\an3}- I am. He did a great
tattoo tonight.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.870
- He kicked ass.
- I am so proud.

40:05.936 --> 40:07.671
{\an3}- Now you get to be
there when your son's born.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.673
