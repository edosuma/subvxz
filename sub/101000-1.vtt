Hey, Paul, come inside!

16:38.916 --> 16:39.746
Clear!

16:45.041 --> 16:46.041
Bloods!

16:48.333 --> 16:49.583
[Paul] Yo, come on in here.

17:03.291 --> 17:05.290
All right. Let's see what we got here.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.380
-[Melvin] Out of sight!
-[Paul] Great googly-moogly.

17:14.458 --> 17:15.708
You know what this means?

17:16.500 --> 17:18.000
We gold standard.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.375
[laughs]

17:19.750 --> 17:20.960
We gold standard.

17:23.290 --> 17:26.790
I've run many tours for GIs
from the American War.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.503
Glad you can now see our country
in a different light.

17:33.375 --> 17:37.495
Wow! Will you look at this?

17:37.583 --> 17:40.133
-[Melvin] It's a whole different place.
-I can't believe it.

17:40.208 --> 17:43.128
They didn't need us.
They should've just sent Mickey D's,

17:43.208 --> 17:44.668
Pizza Hut and The Colonel,

17:44.750 --> 17:46.960
and we would have defeated the V.C.
in one week.

17:47.041 --> 17:48.881
-You got it. [chuckles]
-Finger-lickin' good.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.330
Paul, when did you serve?

17:52.458 --> 17:58.458
I did three tours, man.
'67 to '71. 1st Infantry.

17:59.166 --> 18:01.916
Were you involved
in Operation Junction City?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.170
-We were there. We were all there.
-Oh, yeah.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.080
Yeah.

18:05.875 --> 18:07.165
My father was there, too.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.825
-Yeah?
-25th Infantry, ARVN.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.751
He fought to the very last man.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.920
My brother, give it to me. Give it to me.

18:18.916 --> 18:21.626
My family was here in Saigon when it fell.

18:21.708 --> 18:25.668
My dad spent 18 months
in a communist re-education camp.

18:25.750 --> 18:26.580
Wow.

18:27.166 --> 18:28.826
Many other were not so lucky.

18:30.666 --> 18:33.706
Hey, y'all remember
those fugazi  Rambo  movies?

18:33.791 --> 18:34.921
-Sly.
-Yeah.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.580
I like them shits, man.

18:36.666 --> 18:38.536
You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.

18:38.625 --> 18:42.455
Him and that... that dude, uh,
Walker, Texas Ranger.

18:42.541 --> 18:44.251
-I ain't saying nothing about him.
-Man!

18:44.333 --> 18:47.923
Out there trying to save
some imaginary POWs.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.880
All them Holly-weird motherfuckers
trying to go back and win the Vietnam War.

18:51.958 --> 18:56.708
Yeah. I would be the first cat in line
if there was a flick about a real hero,

18:56.791 --> 18:59.881
you know, one of our blood.
Somebody like Milton Olive.

18:59.958 --> 19:03.288
[Eddie]  That man jumped on that grenade
and saved his Bloods' lives.

19:03.375 --> 19:07.245
[Otis]  And he was the first brother
to be awarded the Medal of Honor in Nam.

19:07.333 --> 19:08.633
Eighteen years old.

19:08.708 --> 19:13.168
Look, I love y'all and all that bullshit,
but, uh, I ain't doin' that.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.500
Man, nobody want you to die for them.

19:15.583 --> 19:16.793
'Cause I ain't.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.711
Like Aretha sang, "You better think."

19:19.791 --> 19:21.751
-Oh, Vinh.
-What the fuck he talkin' about?

19:21.833 --> 19:25.503
Listen, Bloods, I'm out, all right?
Thank you very much.

19:25.583 --> 19:26.713
-Thank you.
-All right.

19:26.791 --> 19:29.461
-Oh. Oh, oh. Be careful, man.
-Yeah?

19:30.291 --> 19:32.421
I'll be careful. Later.

19:32.958 --> 19:34.078
Where's he going?

19:34.958 --> 19:37.038
[Paul]  He got something
to take care of, man.

19:47.291 --> 19:48.831
[footsteps approaching]

19:56.875 --> 19:57.875
Tiên...

20:00.041 --> 20:01.631
you have hardly changed.

20:01.708 --> 20:07.288
We both know that's not true.
But thank you for being so kind.

20:11.958 --> 20:13.828
You look like
you've done well for yourself.

20:14.416 --> 20:15.826
We find a way.

20:17.250 --> 20:21.540
-Yes, we do. When we can.
-Yes.

20:22.250 --> 20:24.170
[in Vietnamese]

20:26.291 --> 20:27.501
[Otis chuckles]

20:28.875 --> 20:30.955
[in English] The gold is belong
to Vietnamese government.

20:31.916 --> 20:35.166
Monsieur Desroche converts the gold
into cash.

20:36.125 --> 20:40.375
He's the only person that I know
who can handle a transaction of this size.

20:42.333 --> 20:45.083
-Have you dealt with him before?
-Yes.

20:46.083 --> 20:48.963
He's expensive. 20%.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.213
-[sighs]
-And I will need 10%.

20:52.291 --> 20:54.631
And there's no other way to move this?

20:55.458 --> 20:56.288
[door opens]

20:56.375 --> 20:59.165
-International export is my business.
-[door closes]

20:59.250 --> 21:01.790
-It's why you call me.
-Yeah.

21:02.666 --> 21:04.376
[woman in Vietnamese]

21:13.041 --> 21:16.251
[in English] This is my daughter, Michon.

21:18.583 --> 21:23.383
And this is my old friend Otis.
From American War.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.380
-[Otis whispers] It's, uh...
-Hello, Otis.

21:28.875 --> 21:30.375
It's very nice to meet you.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.383
[in Vietnamese]

21:33.000 --> 21:34.330
[in English] Thanks, my dear.

21:53.541 --> 21:54.541
[sighs]

22:13.916 --> 22:14.876
Is, uh...

22:20.166 --> 22:25.206
Is, uh... Is that our daughter? Our...

22:26.250 --> 22:28.330
Yes, she is.

22:31.166 --> 22:34.536
She was a bastard child of the enemy.

22:36.625 --> 22:38.205
I was a whore.

22:38.791 --> 22:42.541
Her father was a  moi,  the nigger.

22:45.333 --> 22:47.923
The white GI taught us that word.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.463
Everyone want us out.

22:51.583 --> 22:55.503
We was too dirty to even clean the toilet.

22:57.791 --> 23:01.501
They call our beautiful Michon
the cockroach.

23:07.208 --> 23:09.168
-Mmm?
-No.

23:19.458 --> 23:20.748
Good night, Tiên.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.423
Good night, Otis.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.288
[Michon in Vietnamese]

24:12.916 --> 24:14.376
[bell tolling]

24:24.125 --> 24:27.285
[in English] May I ask, how did they
end up in your possession?

24:27.375 --> 24:29.745
You ask a lotta goddamn questions,
wringer.

24:32.166 --> 24:36.326
Monsieur, maybe they're from a bank
you just knocked off in Manila.

24:36.416 --> 24:39.126
Or maybe the authorities
are looking for them.

24:39.208 --> 24:41.128
I don't need that kind of shit.

24:41.208 --> 24:43.578
We ain't no international criminals,
you dig?

24:43.666 --> 24:47.376
In my line of work,
I have to be very careful,

24:47.458 --> 24:51.458
and that means knowing exactly
who I am in business with.

24:51.541 --> 24:53.961
This cat getting on
my last goddamn nerve, man.

24:54.541 --> 24:57.211
Gentlemen, I believe
our business is finished.

24:57.291 --> 24:58.461
[Paul] Hey, wait a minute.

24:59.250 --> 25:02.080
Do me a favor. Sit down, please?
Just give us that respect.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.040
Where were Frenchies in World War II?

25:07.875 --> 25:10.075
Hitler had y'all by the snails.

25:11.083 --> 25:14.173
The goddamn US of A saved your asses.

25:14.250 --> 25:16.960
If it wasn't for good ol' Uncle Sam,
all of yous,

25:17.041 --> 25:20.751
y'all be speaking the  deutsche
eating bratwurst,

25:20.833 --> 25:26.543
schnitzels and sauerkraut instead
of croissants, snails and escargot.

25:26.625 --> 25:27.785
Come on, Blood. Let it go.

25:27.875 --> 25:29.455
-No, man, no.
-Just let it go!

25:29.541 --> 25:32.171
No, fuck that. I ain't done.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.500
This motherfucker can't tell me shit.

25:38.208 --> 25:40.748
My daddy, God rest his soul,

25:40.833 --> 25:45.043
landed in Normandy and killed  beaucoup
goose-stepping Nazis.

25:45.125 --> 25:49.535
Let me tell you something, them Nazis
weren't no punks neither. Not like you.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.881
-Yeah, okay, I'm done.
-You feel better?

25:56.958 --> 25:58.418
-Yeah.
-[Desroche] Well,

25:59.000 --> 26:04.670
I thank you for this ignorant American
one-sided version of World War II.

26:04.750 --> 26:08.580
Please understand. He taking big risk.

26:08.666 --> 26:09.916
And we ain't?

26:11.041 --> 26:15.251
DaRoach, we gotta trust you,
and you gotta trust us.

26:17.166 --> 26:18.416
[Otis] Mr. Desroche...

26:20.666 --> 26:24.376
Our platoon was ordered
to find a C-47 CIA plane

26:24.458 --> 26:28.168
that went down with a payroll
for the native people. The Lahu.

26:28.250 --> 26:30.960
Now, they didn't wanna be paid
in paper currency,

26:31.041 --> 26:35.251
so Uncle Sam was paying them in gold bars
for their help against the V.C.

26:35.958 --> 26:38.208
Well, we found the gold, and we...

26:38.291 --> 26:43.131
We bury it. For now.
They ask, we say the V.C. got it.

26:43.958 --> 26:46.788
Later on, we come back and collect.

26:46.875 --> 26:48.205
You mean rip it off.

26:48.291 --> 26:50.001
We ain't ripping off shit!

26:51.250 --> 26:53.420
Who feel like
they're ripping something off?

26:54.416 --> 26:57.706
We was the very first people
that died for this red, white and blue.

26:58.666 --> 26:59.826
Yeah, that's right.

27:00.708 --> 27:04.878
It was a soul brother, Crispus Attucks
at the motherfuckin' Boston Massacre.

27:05.708 --> 27:08.458
We been dying for this country
from the very get,

27:08.541 --> 27:11.041
hoping one day they'd give us
our rightful place.

27:11.125 --> 27:14.415
All they give us was a foot
up our black asses. Well, fuck that.

27:15.125 --> 27:19.995
I say the USA owe us. We built this bitch!

27:20.708 --> 27:22.208
So, what you sayin', Blood?

27:24.125 --> 27:27.745
I'm saying... we repossess this gold...

27:29.125 --> 27:32.665
like they about to come repossess
your cash yield convertible now.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.170
[all laughing]

27:36.666 --> 27:41.536
We repossess this gold for every single
black boot that never made it home.

27:42.333 --> 27:46.423
Every brother and sister stolen
from Mother Africa to Jamestown, Virginia

27:46.500 --> 27:48.790
way back in 1619.

27:51.083 --> 27:54.173
We give this gold to our people.

27:55.291 --> 27:58.381
You feel that? You feel it?

28:00.458 --> 28:03.128
-Now, let's bury our gold.
-[Paul] Reparations.

28:03.208 --> 28:05.208
-[glasses clink]
-[Norman] Bloods.

28:05.291 --> 28:06.711
-[gunshot echoes]
-[all]  Bloods.

28:06.791 --> 28:08.671
[distant gunfire]

28:11.000 --> 28:13.960
We went back a few weeks later,
but the area was napalmed,

28:14.041 --> 28:16.331
and we lost all of our landmarks.

28:16.416 --> 28:22.626
But recently, a mudslide has exposed
what might be the C-47's tail,

28:23.291 --> 28:26.381
and satellite pictures
have pinpointed the spot.

28:26.458 --> 28:29.958
Mmm. You're more informed
than your friend here.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.791
Sir, are you in or out?

28:47.500 --> 28:53.420
This is my last offer per kilo,
less my commission.

29:03.833 --> 29:04.883
Tiên said 20.

29:04.958 --> 29:09.208
One cannot carry millions of dollars
through US Customs.

29:09.708 --> 29:13.128
The extra two points will get you
a dummy corporation

29:13.208 --> 29:16.708
and a tax-free offshore account in Macau.

29:17.291 --> 29:21.081
You can then withdraw the funds
from any bank in the world.

29:21.166 --> 29:23.706
How do I know that you two
ain't a con artist team?

29:24.500 --> 29:28.250
As you said, you simply must trust us.

29:28.333 --> 29:32.463
Yeah, well, the extra 2%
comes outta her cut.

29:33.458 --> 29:34.288
That's right.

29:37.333 --> 29:39.503
-I'll cover it.
-Price of doing business.

29:40.416 --> 29:42.666
-So, we good?
-Yeah.

29:44.041 --> 29:45.961
-I'm good.
-Yeah, I'm good.

29:46.708 --> 29:52.128
And, sir, Uncle Sam did no better
than France in Vietnam.

29:53.958 --> 29:57.628
Gentlemen, I look forward
to seeing you again in a few days.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.128
If you will excuse me,

29:59.208 --> 30:02.078
I have a lot of things to do
for all of us.

30:02.916 --> 30:03.996
[in French]

30:05.750 --> 30:06.790
[in English] And, uh...

30:07.291 --> 30:08.421
vive la France.

30:10.041 --> 30:11.711
[in English] This motherfucker, man.

30:12.583 --> 30:13.753
-[door shuts]
-[water running]

30:14.458 --> 30:15.708
[softly] I don't take that.

30:16.791 --> 30:17.881
[water stops running]

30:26.291 --> 30:27.831
What the fuck are you doing here?

30:28.500 --> 30:29.630
I'm worried about you.

30:31.250 --> 30:32.080
Why?

30:33.500 --> 30:36.540
-Well, I found out you were coming here.
-And?

30:37.541 --> 30:39.251
And I came to check on you.

30:41.125 --> 30:44.535
You don't give a flying fuck
about me. [scoffs]

30:44.625 --> 30:47.575
I do. You been acting more crazy
than usual.

30:52.541 --> 30:53.501
Yeah, well...

30:56.041 --> 30:57.461
you consider me checked on.

30:59.208 --> 31:00.578
You're here for the gold.

31:01.375 --> 31:02.205
Don't lie.

31:03.458 --> 31:05.878
You're going after the gold.
I read Otis' emails.

31:07.125 --> 31:11.415

31:12.375 --> 31:14.415
[laughs] Come on now, Dad.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.423
What do you want, David?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.580
-An equal share for helping you find it.
-Hell to the naw!

31:19.666 --> 31:23.166
The authorities find out about this,
y'all go back to the crib empty-handed.

31:23.916 --> 31:27.456
So, you just a lil' jive-ass
gangster now, huh?

31:27.541 --> 31:31.791
After everything you've put me through,
I'd say you getting a basement bargain.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.040
You ungrateful lil'...
lil' Black Studies teacher nigga.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.883
You want to tell your Bloods or should I?

31:49.958 --> 31:51.878
[Eddie] You sure know
how to raise 'em, don't you?

31:51.958 --> 31:55.538
What happens if we bum-rush your boy
and throw his ass off that balcony?

31:55.625 --> 31:57.495
Know I'm taking
a couple of you OGs with me.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.083
-Don't ever threaten my son, man.
-Or what?

32:00.166 --> 32:02.286
Or you will nab more trouble
than you know what to do with.

32:02.375 --> 32:03.625
-Oh, come on!
-Come on!

32:03.708 --> 32:05.168
Cool it, God damn it! Cool it!

32:06.958 --> 32:08.538
David, you are not getting a full share.

32:08.625 --> 32:11.035
-You and your daddy can split a share.
-You can forget that.

32:11.125 --> 32:12.325
You take it or leave it.

32:15.458 --> 32:16.628
[sighs]

32:17.833 --> 32:19.543
You see what you made me do, man?

32:20.458 --> 32:21.788
Let me tell you somethin'.

32:22.375 --> 32:25.625
You ain't been nothin'
but an anchor around my neck

32:25.708 --> 32:27.378
since the day you were born.

32:28.416 --> 32:33.076
Yeah, I said it, and I mean it, too.
Take this shit.

32:35.625 --> 32:36.705

32:41.125 --> 32:43.165
David, you're a buck private
in this outfit.

32:43.250 --> 32:47.830
You do what we say when we say it.
No questions asked. Understood?

32:49.375 --> 32:51.325
Overstood, Godfather.

33:00.875 --> 33:04.955
-I have bad feeling about this, Otis.
-I'm gonna be all right.

33:05.541 --> 33:10.831
Gold does strange things to people.
Even old friends. Be safe.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.075
All right. Yeah.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.746
I just hope I don't have to use it.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.210
I'll see you in a bit, all right?

35:40.083 --> 35:42.003
-David.
-Yeah?

35:42.083 --> 35:43.633
Why did you come here?

35:46.958 --> 35:48.328
Well, he's my dad.

35:51.291 --> 35:53.041
Feels like my last chance with him.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.883
-He needs counseling.
-I know.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.208
-Talks to himself.

36:05.291 --> 36:08.001
Your pops was never the same

36:09.750 --> 36:10.750
[Otis] Hmm.

36:11.833 --> 36:15.463
-You know, he calls his name in his sleep.
-I can believe that.

36:17.791 --> 36:20.131
-Who was that guy?
-Norm?

36:21.958 --> 36:25.168
That brother was the best damn soldier
that ever lived.

-[gun cocks]

36:47.875 --> 36:50.075
[Otis]  Wasn't many brothers
who made squad leader.

36:51.166 --> 36:53.376
The man was using Bloods
for cannon fodder.

36:54.083 --> 36:56.923
White boys who stayed in college,
they'd dodge that shit.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.290
They put our poor black asses

37:00.375 --> 37:02.075
killing us off like flies.

37:06.916 --> 37:11.456
Stormin' earned his name,

37:12.083 --> 37:13.923
Trained us in the way of the jungle.

I see cops patrolling my neighborhood
like it's some police state.

I can feel just how much I ain't worth.

38:50.375 --> 38:52.745
-[slide projector clicks]
-[Otis]  Gave us something to believe in.

38:53.333 --> 38:55.383
A direction, a purpose.

38:56.541 --> 38:59.751
He taught us about black history
when it wasn't really popular back then.

39:01.041 --> 39:04.541
Schooled us about drinking that
anti-commie Kool-Aid they was selling.

39:05.333 --> 39:08.253
Yeah, he was our Malcolm and our Martin.

39:09.291 --> 39:11.921
Norm had a way of keeping us
from going off.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.000
He wasn't no Tom.

Black GI,

39:43.625 --> 39:49.575
in Memphis, Tennessee, a white man
assassinate Dr. Martin Luther King...

39:50.708 --> 39:53.878
who heroically opposed the cruel

39:53.958 --> 39:57.458
-racial discrimination in the USA.
-[single gunshot]

39:58.166 --> 40:02.786
Dr. King also opposed
the US war in Vietnam.

40:04.541 --> 40:10.291
Black GI, your government
sent 600,000 troops

40:10.375 --> 40:11.915
to crush the rebellion.

40:12.541 --> 40:19.501
Your soul sister and soul brothers
are enraged in over 122 cities.

40:20.125 --> 40:27.075
They kill them while you fight against us,
so far away from where you are needed.

40:29.250 --> 40:33.920
Black GI, the South Vietnamese people
are resolute

40:34.000 --> 40:37.040
against these fascist acts against Negroes

40:37.541 --> 40:40.251
who struggle for civil rights and freedom.

40:42.750 --> 40:47.920
Negroes are only 11% of the US population,

40:48.500 --> 40:52.210
but among troops here in Vietnam,
you are 32%.

40:54.625 --> 40:59.325
Black GI, is it fair to serve more
than the white Americans

40:59.416 --> 41:00.666
that sent you here?

41:01.166 --> 41:06.416
Nothing is more confuse
than to be ordered into a war to die

41:06.916 --> 41:12.036
or to be maimed for life without
the faintest idea of what's going on.

41:13.416 --> 41:15.786
I dedicate this next record

41:15.875 --> 41:19.625

of the 1st Infantry Divisions.

-And a tooth for a tooth.

are burnin' shit down back home, Norm.

41:48.458 --> 41:51.538
I love you, man, but you're wrong.
Dead wrong.

41:51.625 --> 41:56.325
You're talking about Dr. King.
You're talking about a man of peace.

41:56.916 --> 41:58.786
And that's what got Dr. King killed.

41:59.291 --> 42:03.041
I'm as mad as everybody.
All us Bloods got a right to be, but...

42:05.208 --> 42:06.378
we Bloods.

42:07.875 --> 42:11.415
Won't let nobody use our rage against us.
We control our rage.

42:12.416 --> 42:16.036
Now, what y'all are trying to do right now
ain't changing shit.

42:17.458 --> 42:19.998
So, stand down. That's an order.

42:20.083 --> 42:22.173
Nah. Fuck an order, Norm!

42:25.666 --> 42:27.416
You're gonna have to kill me first.

42:29.958 --> 42:31.248

[Otis]  And let me tell you, out of all
of us, your pops was closest to him.

43:40.958 --> 43:43.078
Believed in Norman like a religion.

43:43.583 --> 43:46.173
I don't think he believed
in anything since.

You brothers want anything?

43:51.458 --> 43:52.748

So, how you eat it?

44:21.166 --> 44:22.206
It tastes like chicken.

44:22.291 --> 44:25.131

One is my father.

50:16.166 --> 50:18.126
Must be something powerful,

50:18.208 --> 50:20.668
coming back after all these years
with your father.

50:21.250 --> 50:22.880
-Yeah, it's powerful all right.
-Yeah.

50:24.166 --> 50:25.076
What is your name?

50:25.666 --> 50:30.376
Hedy. Like Hedy Lamarr. No?

50:30.458 --> 50:32.668
Old time Hollywood star.

50:33.875 --> 50:36.375
But, well, my last name is Bouvier, so...

50:37.833 --> 50:38.673
Cool.

50:39.375 --> 50:40.245
It's cool.

Seppo... what do you do?

51:56.250 --> 52:01.000
How does one get involved in
the landmine disposal business? Pray tell.

52:01.833 --> 52:04.503
The Bouviers have a history in Vietnam.

52:06.083 --> 52:09.503
It's strange how a war never ends
for those involved.

52:09.583 --> 52:12.923
See, like, landmines planted years ago...

52:13.833 --> 52:17.173

all these years later.

52:17.583 --> 52:19.173
Back to your family history.

52:19.666 --> 52:24.996
My family made several fortunes
owning a rubber plantation,

52:25.875 --> 52:30.125
and then they bought up much more of
the rice market and made another fortune.

52:30.208 --> 52:31.748
See, the white gold.

52:33.541 --> 52:34.421
Hmm.

52:36.208 --> 52:37.788
Wonderful family business.

52:38.916 --> 52:42.666
But one exception, we exploited
the shit out of the Vietnamese people.

52:43.500 --> 52:45.630
So, that's the meaning behind the mines.

52:46.291 --> 52:49.041
So, what did the Bouvier family
think about what you do?

52:49.125 --> 52:50.375

52:53.708 --> 52:59.628
I'm the founder and the director of LAMB,

Yeah, LAMB. Love Against Mines and Bombs.

53:25.500 --> 53:28.290

is a lot less dangerous than yours.

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:20.173
[Paul] Oh, yeah, baby.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:21.750
What happens if somebody get heatstroke

01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:23.463
or sprain an ankle or something?

01:00:23.791 --> 01:00:26.291
Otis is a medic. A good one, too.

01:00:26.375 --> 01:00:28.165
Even took a few rounds out of me once.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:30.460
From your black monkey ass, as I recall.

01:00:30.541 --> 01:00:32.041
[all laughing]

01:00:33.958 --> 01:00:34.788
What's that?

01:00:35.791 --> 01:00:36.751
Water.

01:00:37.708 --> 01:00:40.418
What? I need to take a breathalyzer test?

01:00:41.791 --> 01:00:44.881
-Well, what are those?
-[Otis] It's something for my hip.

01:00:44.958 --> 01:00:46.628
I know that. But what are they?

01:00:47.791 --> 01:00:48.631
OxyContin.

01:00:49.208 --> 01:00:51.208
[laughs] Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:54.421
You think I'm sneakin' a drink,
and you on that opioid epidemic shit.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.170
-It's prescribed.
-Oh, yeah. You writing the prescriptions?

01:00:57.666 --> 01:01:00.576
No, the VA. Just like everybody else.

01:01:00.666 --> 01:01:02.286
You best be careful with that shit.

01:01:02.375 --> 01:01:05.075
-What is this, an intervention?
-You need one?

01:01:07.583 --> 01:01:10.383
Y'all think I'm a junkie? Hmm?

01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:14.833
Oh, shit.

01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:17.921
There. I don't need this shit.

01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:48.288
This way.

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.250
[Otis in Vietnamese]

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:02.173
[boy speaking]

01:02:09.041 --> 01:02:10.081
[Paul in English] Let's go.

01:02:12.958 --> 01:02:13.958
[camera shutter clicks]

01:02:14.916 --> 01:02:16.076
[buffalo grunts]

01:02:16.916 --> 01:02:18.076
[snoring]

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:22.500
[Melvin] You know he hurting.

01:02:24.666 --> 01:02:27.376
[Eddie] Yeah, man.
I hope he's gonna be okay.

01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:40.035
[animals howling]

01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:40.955
[David] Dad!

01:02:42.416 --> 01:02:44.206
-Dad, what the hell is that?
-[shushing]

01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:46.671
-[animals continue howling]
-[leaves rustling]

01:02:48.708 --> 01:02:49.998
[David] Dad! Dad!

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.500
Gibbons.

01:02:56.125 --> 01:02:58.325
I seen a leopard tear one apart once.

01:02:59.166 --> 01:03:00.576
There are leopards out here?

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:05.000
Leopards are all gone now.
Poachers wiped 'em out.

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:07.630
-You see that?
-What? What? What?

01:03:07.708 --> 01:03:10.748
Shh! Looked like a man walking out there.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.710
It was just a flash, but I saw it.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:15.875
[shushing]

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:19.208
-Maybe-- Maybe it was a monkey.
-No goddamn monkey.

01:03:26.166 --> 01:03:27.666
[David] Hey, you see something?

01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:33.165
[whispers] Clear. Clear.

01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:39.921
Oh, my God.

01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:52.081
I'm sorry about being on edge,
you know. Being back here...

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.080
it is not easy.

01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:00.831
It's cool.

01:04:03.583 --> 01:04:06.133
I don't like the way you did it,
but I'm glad you're here.

01:04:10.833 --> 01:04:12.423
Your daddy loves you, you know.

01:04:14.333 --> 01:04:15.503
You know that, right?

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.420
-You've got a funny way of showing it.
-Yeah.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.540
But I do. I know it.

01:04:25.166 --> 01:04:26.376
I love you back.

01:04:27.958 --> 01:04:31.078
-[mosquito buzzing]
-[grunts]

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:33.250
[buzzing continues]

01:04:33.333 --> 01:04:38.133
Damn! Who got the bug spray?
Bugs out here eating my ass up.

01:04:40.083 --> 01:04:41.423
Otis had it last.

01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:45.420
[Melvin] Well, can you walk your big
pigeon-toed ass over there and get it?

01:04:46.333 --> 01:04:48.003
What's wrong with your big lumbering ass?

01:04:48.083 --> 01:04:49.833
Man, you sitting right there.

01:04:49.916 --> 01:04:51.826
-[Paul] Oh, shit.
-You sitting right next to the bug spray.

01:04:51.916 --> 01:04:54.166
I gotta get up from my rock,
walk over there and get it.

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:55.790
You're one lazy-ass motherfucker.

01:04:55.875 --> 01:05:00.075
[Melvin] You a Thanksgiving jive
turkey giblet sorry-ass motherfucker.

01:05:00.166 --> 01:05:02.576
-[David] Shut up. He's trying to sleep.
-[Melvin] We up, he should be up.

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:04.996
[Eddie] Every time,
you want me to get the shit.

01:05:05.083 --> 01:05:07.423
You can't get up and do it your damn self.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.330
[Melvin] I got to get up off my damn rock
and walk over there and get it.

01:05:10.416 --> 01:05:16.786
You sitting right there. You get it?
You see it? Big paddle ass. God damn.

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:17.875
Hey, Paul.

01:05:34.708 --> 01:05:36.248
Ain't this a bitch?

01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:42.825
Nigga, get up.

01:05:42.916 --> 01:05:44.326
-[Otis] What?
-[Paul] Get up, nigga.

01:05:45.916 --> 01:05:47.246
Why you ain't tell us, man?

01:05:47.333 --> 01:05:48.713
-[Otis] What?
-What?

01:05:49.666 --> 01:05:52.036
No wonder he wanted to make
all the arrangements.

01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:54.415
-Tiên give this to you?
-So, what about it?

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.790
[Paul] We should all be packin', you--

01:05:55.875 --> 01:05:57.205
-[Melvin] No.
-[David] Get the gun!

01:05:57.291 --> 01:05:58.961
-[Eddie] Come on, man!
-[Paul] You motherfucker!

01:05:59.041 --> 01:06:01.331
-[Otis] Come on. Beat his ass down, now.
-[David] Shit.

01:06:02.833 --> 01:06:03.673
You all right?

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:05.880
You a pussy-whipped motherfucker,
ain't you?

01:06:05.958 --> 01:06:07.668
Man, you don't see who she is?

01:06:08.666 --> 01:06:10.536
And that French fuck, Desroche.

01:06:10.625 --> 01:06:13.125
I don't know Desroche
from Adam's house cat,

01:06:14.125 --> 01:06:16.575
but if Tiên vouched for him,
that's good enough for me.

01:06:17.125 --> 01:06:20.535
She's a Soul Alley ho, remember that.

01:06:21.125 --> 01:06:23.625
You know, Paul, you better check yourself.

01:06:23.708 --> 01:06:27.248
I know your mama-san's slanted pussy
strung you out.

01:06:27.333 --> 01:06:29.043
She's still a fucking ho!

01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:32.458
[David] Whoa, whoa, man!

01:06:32.541 --> 01:06:35.831
Get your motherfucking hands off me!
I'll kill you!

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.420
-I'll kill that motherfucker.
-Chill! Chill! Chill!

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.420
Chill! What the fuck's wrong with you?

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:42.670
Breathe, man!

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:45.630
[Otis] Come on. Give it to him.

01:06:46.833 --> 01:06:48.173
Go ahead, give it to him.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.170
Take it. I'm through with it.

01:06:55.291 --> 01:06:56.171
Here.

01:06:57.916 --> 01:06:58.746
Happy?

01:07:04.958 --> 01:07:06.918
[Otis] Man, we're walking
right on top of it.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.250
[Melvin] You said that on the last hill.
Perspective's totally different.

01:07:10.333 --> 01:07:11.883
[Otis] No, it's gotta be here.

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:14.918
[Eddie] God damn! We're fucking lost!

01:07:15.708 --> 01:07:18.378
-[Paul] Otis and Eddie think they slick.
-[Otis] What?

01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:21.708
[Paul] Marching us around and around
in circles so we give up and go home.

01:07:22.208 --> 01:07:24.748
You come back,
you collect it all for yourself, huh?

01:07:24.833 --> 01:07:27.883
Then why'd I follow your sorry ass
out here in the first place?

01:07:27.958 --> 01:07:30.538
'Cause you couldn't afford
the airfare, the gear, hotel.

01:07:31.416 --> 01:07:34.456
[chuckles] You needed
Banker Drysdale right there. Uh-huh.

01:07:34.541 --> 01:07:35.381
Shut up!

01:07:37.458 --> 01:07:39.128
You and Tiên are up to something.

01:07:40.333 --> 01:07:42.673
Let me tell you something, Otis,
all y'all.

01:07:44.666 --> 01:07:49.376
I don't need this shit. You got me?
I'm here for Norm.

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:54.583
I'm here for Norm.
I ain't going for no okey-doke bullshit.

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:58.960
Dope fiend double-cross, hell no.
Fuck that.

01:08:01.833 --> 01:08:03.423
Where you going, boy?

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.710
I'mma go down to the bank
and make a deposit.

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:09.128
-Go on, son. Handle your business.
-[Otis] Let me see that GPS.

01:08:13.333 --> 01:08:14.833
This don't make no damn sense.

01:08:18.582 --> 01:08:20.042
Shit, man. Come on.

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:48.831
[metallic clinking]

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:59.332
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:09:00.291 --> 01:09:03.041
-Hey, Dad! Hey, guys!
-[Otis] What?

01:09:03.125 --> 01:09:04.785
I think I found something!

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:06.415
-Gold! Gold!
-[overlapping] Oh, shit.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.670
[David] Quick, bring a shovel!

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:12.290
I think I found the gold!
Gold! Dad! Dad, I found it!

01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:14.415
-[Otis] I hope he really found that shit.
-[David] Gold!

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:15.710
[Paul] Where you at, son?

01:09:15.791 --> 01:09:16.631
Watch your step.

01:09:16.707 --> 01:09:18.167
[David] Shit, get your shovels!

01:09:18.832 --> 01:09:24.502
Bring your shovels! Bring the shovels!
I found it! I found it! I found it!

01:09:25.832 --> 01:09:27.212
[exclaims]

01:09:27.957 --> 01:09:29.747
-[Paul] Watch your step over there.
-[Otis] Right.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.042
[David yells]

01:09:35.166 --> 01:09:36.626
Holy shit!

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.750
-[David] That's it, ain't it?
-That's it.

01:09:42.582 --> 01:09:43.423
Holy...

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.630
-God damn! Oh, man!
-[all laughing]

01:09:49.707 --> 01:09:51.207
-[Eddie] Let me see.
-Yeah, that's it.

01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:53.041
Oh, shit. [laughing]

01:09:59.958 --> 01:10:00.878
Damn!

01:10:01.916 --> 01:10:03.076
[David exclaims]

01:10:04.541 --> 01:10:06.921
Check your map. Check your map.
Check your map.

01:10:08.708 --> 01:10:10.288
We're in the right coordinates.

01:10:13.291 --> 01:10:15.331
-Yeah. Yeah.
-[Eddie] Hey, y'all.

01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:19.581
Hallowed ground, Bloods. Holy ground.

01:10:19.666 --> 01:10:21.576
[laughing]

01:10:21.666 --> 01:10:24.416
[David] Yeah, that's it, right?
That's it. [exclaims]

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:25.540
Yeah, that's it.

01:10:25.625 --> 01:10:26.785
-[Otis] Oh, Lord.
-Yeah, that's it.

01:10:26.875 --> 01:10:28.745
-[Otis] Thank you, Lord.
-Yeah, that's it!

01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:31.253
-[all laughing]
-[Otis] Yeah! Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!

01:10:31.333 --> 01:10:32.963
Yeah, it is, Bloods!

01:10:33.041 --> 01:10:34.171
[all cheering]

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.210
-Let me get a picture.
-[exclaiming]

01:10:37.291 --> 01:10:39.251
No! No evidence, man. No evidence.

01:10:39.333 --> 01:10:41.003
-[Melvin] Put that camera down.
-My bad.

01:10:41.083 --> 01:10:42.173
[Paul] Hold that, man.

01:10:44.916 --> 01:10:46.126
[all grunting rhythmically]

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:47.078

-Come on!
-[David] Whoo!

01:11:00.083 --> 01:11:01.633
Oh, yeah. Come on, man.

-Come on, now!
-Come on, man, get it.

01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:05.495
[metal detector beeping rapidly]

01:11:05.583 --> 01:11:10.003
Guys! Guys! I got something!
I got something right here! Right here.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.000
I'm getting a hit right there.

01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:15.325
-Right here?
-[Paul] Yeah.

01:11:15.416 --> 01:11:16.246
[Eddie] Okay.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
-Yeah, that's something there.
-[Eddie] You in? Oh, shit!

01:11:22.083 --> 01:11:23.333
[Paul] That's it right there.

01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:26.080
[Eddie] This the spot, right here?

01:11:26.583 --> 01:11:28.883
-Wait, I see something here.
-[Paul] Watch your fingers.

01:11:28.958 --> 01:11:31.878
-Otis, it's right there.
-[Otis] Mind your hand. Look out.

01:11:31.958 --> 01:11:32.958
Look out for your hands.

01:11:36.208 --> 01:11:38.538
-Let's go. That's a lid!
-[David] I got a handle.

01:11:40.083 --> 01:11:41.463
-Shit!
-[Eddie] What, it just come off?

01:11:41.541 --> 01:11:43.751
-[David] Damn handle broke.
-[Otis] Shit. It rusted.

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:45.583
[Paul] Don't put the dirt back
where I dug it out!

01:11:45.666 --> 01:11:47.786
-[Melvin] Move it out the damn way!
-It's all right.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.540
[Paul] Here, let's just grab it.
Grab it. It looks like...

01:11:51.625 --> 01:11:53.705
[Eddie] Yeah. Ready? Bring it up!

01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:54.791
[all grunting]

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:03.173
-Shit.
-Wait, where is it? Where is it?

01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:05.673
-Come on!
-[Paul] You gotta be kidding me.

01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:07.040
Let me tip it.

01:12:08.166 --> 01:12:10.626
Ah! Fuckin' fool's gold.

01:12:10.708 --> 01:12:12.168
[Otis laughing]

01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:14.630
-[metal detector beeping]
-[Otis] Whoo!

01:12:14.708 --> 01:12:16.578
We are some gold-plated fools, y'all.

01:12:17.208 --> 01:12:19.878
We're some gold-plated
motherfucking fools.

01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:22.788
Hey, guys, guys, I got another one!
I got something right here.

01:12:22.875 --> 01:12:23.785
[Otis] Where?

01:12:23.875 --> 01:12:25.075
-Right here.
-I got it!

01:12:25.166 --> 01:12:27.536
-[Melvin] Right there!
-[Otis] I got it! I got it! I got it!

01:12:27.625 --> 01:12:28.535
-[Eddie] Got that one?
-[Otis] Yeah.

01:12:28.625 --> 01:12:29.535
[Eddie] All right, go.

01:12:30.166 --> 01:12:31.456
[metal detector beeping rapidly]

01:12:31.541 --> 01:12:32.881
-I got another one!
-[Eddie] I got it!

01:12:32.958 --> 01:12:34.668
-I got another one right here.
-I'm coming!

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.000
-Right there.
-All right.

01:12:36.083 --> 01:12:37.583
-You good?
-[Paul] I'm good.

01:12:40.541 --> 01:12:42.041
[Otis exclaiming]

01:12:42.166 --> 01:12:44.456
[screaming, laughter]

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:48.960
[all exclaiming]

01:12:49.041 --> 01:12:50.001
-I got a hit!
-[Eddie] Oh, shit!

01:12:50.083 --> 01:12:51.503
[Melvin]
I'm getting hits everywhere!

01:12:51.583 --> 01:12:53.003
[metal detector continues beeping]

01:12:53.083 --> 01:12:55.293
-Right there. Right there.
-[David] All right. Come on.

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:01.003
-I'm getting hits all over the damn place.
-[Otis] Oh, shit!

01:13:01.083 --> 01:13:02.133
[Otis laughs]

01:13:03.666 --> 01:13:06.626
[David] All right. Put it in your pocket.
Put it in your pocket.

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:11.790
-All right, I got three right here.
-[Paul] I got one here.

01:13:13.625 --> 01:13:15.625
[David] Keep digging. Keep digging.

01:13:19.166 --> 01:13:21.916
I'm getting hits all over the mountain!
All over the mountain!

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.210
[all laughing]

01:13:23.291 --> 01:13:25.041
[Paul and David exclaiming rhythmically]

01:13:28.958 --> 01:13:30.128
[Paul] Come on, give me some.

01:13:30.208 --> 01:13:31.378
[both exclaim]

01:13:32.083 --> 01:13:34.383
Come on, baby. [yells]

01:13:34.458 --> 01:13:36.958
Hey, I got one here. I got one here.

01:13:37.041 --> 01:13:39.131
They must've fallen in the mudslide.

01:13:39.208 --> 01:13:41.918
Hey, I got something to tell y'all.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.040
-What?
-What?

01:13:43.875 --> 01:13:48.625
Holy motherfucking, motherfucking,
mother of gold!

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:51.995
-Mother of gold, motherfucker!
-[Melvin] Get your ass over here!

01:13:52.083 --> 01:13:53.883
[Eddie] Why don't you start digging,
roody-poo?

01:13:53.958 --> 01:13:57.578
Motherfucker, I don't dig for the gold!
I find the motherfucking gold!

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:58.876
-Fuck you!
-Silly-ass.

01:13:58.958 --> 01:14:01.918
-[Paul] Watch your fingers.
-[David] Come on! Keep digging!

01:14:04.125 --> 01:14:08.495
Forty-five thousand per bar.
Seventeen million all in.

01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:10.665
[Eddie laughs] Yeah.

01:14:11.416 --> 01:14:13.416
But I'm not leaving here without Norman.

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:16.746
[Melvin] You think Norman cares
whether you find his remains or not?

01:14:17.333 --> 01:14:20.793
You remember what Norman said.
"That gold should go to our people."

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:24.883
Whoa, what you trying to say, man?

01:14:25.541 --> 01:14:27.751
That gold should go
towards black liberation.

01:14:27.833 --> 01:14:31.133
[scoffs] Yeah, our black liberation.
You do for self.

01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:34.130
I'm talking about black reparations, man.

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:35.538
[Melvin] I got mine's.

01:14:36.333 --> 01:14:37.543
What about our people?

01:14:37.625 --> 01:14:39.075
What about my people?

01:14:39.583 --> 01:14:42.963
You do what you want with your share,
and we'll each decide for ourselves.

01:14:43.041 --> 01:14:46.251
-That's what Norman said now.
-Now, see? See? Otis knows.

01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:49.710
Norman wanted that gold
to go towards the cause.

01:14:49.791 --> 01:14:53.921
Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Eddie.
You rich. Money don't mean shit to you.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.080
-I am not rich.
-Yeah, right. Whatever.

01:14:57.166 --> 01:14:59.286
-I'm not rich!
-[chuckles] Okay.

01:14:59.375 --> 01:15:02.825
-I'm broke, man.
-How the fuck are you broke, Eddie? Huh?

01:15:06.666 --> 01:15:09.496
-I lost it all.
-Oh, he bullshittin'.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.170
I wish I was, man.

01:15:13.166 --> 01:15:14.286
Spill it.

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.540
Come on, man. Fess up.

01:15:22.416 --> 01:15:27.376
Ex-wives, bad investments, back taxes,

01:15:27.458 --> 01:15:30.958
livin' large, drinking, being stupid.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.210
-You fuckin' name it, I spent money on it.
-But you paid for all of this shit.

01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:39.331
Yeah, yeah, I paid for all this shit
on a black card that's already overdrawn.

01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:43.753
What about all them car dealerships
with your name on 'em?

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:45.830
I don't own 'em.

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:48.955
I mean, my name is good
in the business and all, and...

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.290
dealers choose to use 'em, but...

01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:54.285
they'll pull that shit as soon
as it stops working for 'em.

01:15:54.875 --> 01:15:56.875
I'm telling you,
I ain't got a pot to piss in

01:15:56.958 --> 01:15:59.918
or a window to throw it out of.
And that's facts!

01:16:04.416 --> 01:16:05.376
God damn.

01:16:07.708 --> 01:16:08.708
Sorry, bro.

01:16:11.375 --> 01:16:12.875
Can we just go find Norm?

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:17.500
Stormin' Norm's been waiting.

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:27.705
Damn.

01:16:29.375 --> 01:16:30.825
Ain't that some doo-doo.

01:16:42.166 --> 01:16:43.626
[beeping]

01:16:56.166 --> 01:16:57.416
[camera shutter clicking]

01:17:04.208 --> 01:17:05.248
[beeping rapidly]

01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:10.080
Hey, Bloods, I got something!
Right here I got... I'm getting a big hit.

01:17:10.875 --> 01:17:13.125
-I'm getting a big hit, right here.
-Are you sure?

01:17:13.208 --> 01:17:17.128
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all over,
right in here. Right in this whole area.

01:17:19.166 --> 01:17:20.416
[Paul grunting]

01:17:23.666 --> 01:17:25.626
[Melvin] It's a big hit.
Right here. Right here.

01:17:26.958 --> 01:17:28.458
Right in here, baby. Right in there.

01:17:53.916 --> 01:17:55.536
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.540
That's...

01:18:07.375 --> 01:18:08.535
Shit.

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:16.828
It's Norm.

01:18:19.208 --> 01:18:20.578
Oh, brother.

01:18:29.666 --> 01:18:30.876
[Paul panting]

01:18:54.333 --> 01:18:55.383
[Otis] It's Norm?

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.920
-Yeah, it's Norm.
-[Otis] Oh, shit.

01:19:00.458 --> 01:19:02.578
[Eddie panting and grunting]

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:15.376
[Otis] Okay. Okay.

01:19:15.916 --> 01:19:17.826
[Eddie] Holy shit. Come on. [voice breaks]

01:19:21.291 --> 01:19:23.331
Shit. Shit.

01:19:29.125 --> 01:19:29.955
Shit.

01:19:32.666 --> 01:19:33.746
[Paul] Hey, Norm.

01:19:35.541 --> 01:19:36.631
We all here, man.

01:19:38.333 --> 01:19:41.173
Otis, Melvin, Eddie.

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:47.670
I got my son, David. Right here.

01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:53.788
Took us a little longer
than we thought, but...

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:57.580
we came back like we said we would.

01:20:01.166 --> 01:20:04.536
But this time when we get on that plane,
that Freedom Bird,

01:20:05.125 --> 01:20:06.665
going back to the world,

01:20:08.375 --> 01:20:11.955
you are coming with us, brother.
You coming with us, brother.

01:20:15.083 --> 01:20:17.253
Now, both of your parents have passed,

01:20:17.333 --> 01:20:23.673
I guess you know that, but your sisters,
Janet and Kim, will be waiting for us...

01:20:28.166 --> 01:20:29.956
when we land, brother.

01:20:34.875 --> 01:20:37.285
You goin' home, Blood.

01:20:41.291 --> 01:20:42.671
You're goin' home, Blood.

01:20:49.083 --> 01:20:50.423
Come on, now.

01:21:10.208 --> 01:21:11.418
Blessed holy God.

01:21:14.125 --> 01:21:16.455
We come around
your mighty throne of grace...

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.500
to thank you for this day.

01:21:23.416 --> 01:21:28.746
We thank you for the reunion
of family... and friendship...

01:21:30.541 --> 01:21:31.751
and the brotherhood.

01:21:34.958 --> 01:21:39.628
Continuing in prayer, Lord,
we ask you for traveling grace...

01:21:40.708 --> 01:21:42.038
and the mending of hearts.

01:21:43.791 --> 01:21:46.211
In your son's righteous
and holy name, we pray.

01:21:47.083 --> 01:21:48.883
-Amen.
-[all]  Amen.

01:21:48.958 --> 01:21:50.288
[cicadas chirping loudly]

01:21:51.208 --> 01:21:52.788
Damn! What is that sound?

01:21:54.333 --> 01:21:56.333
Uh, cicadas.

01:21:57.791 --> 01:21:59.791
-Cicadas?
-Yeah.

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:02.713
They don't sound like that back home.

01:22:04.291 --> 01:22:05.631
We ain't home, son.

01:22:08.166 --> 01:22:09.166
We ain't home.

01:22:11.208 --> 01:22:12.378
[gold bars clinking]

01:22:35.208 --> 01:22:36.038
[grunts]

01:22:39.416 --> 01:22:42.376
-[David] You all right?
-[Paul] Yeah, yeah, yeah. [pants]

01:22:51.875 --> 01:22:54.245
[Paul] Hey, son, get this off of me, man.

01:22:56.416 --> 01:22:57.416
[Otis grunting]

01:23:01.125 --> 01:23:02.125
-[Paul] All right.
-[David] I got it.

01:23:02.208 --> 01:23:04.248
-[Paul] Just let it drop.
-[David] Let it go. [grunts]

01:23:06.541 --> 01:23:07.831
Hand me my water, man.

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:11.080
[David] Hydrate.

01:23:11.166 --> 01:23:12.576
-[Melvin] Lord have mercy.
-My man.

01:23:14.708 --> 01:23:17.128
Hey, I can manage another 30, 40 pounds.

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:19.205
-Yeah.
-That be just great, bud.

01:23:19.291 --> 01:23:22.791
My son play the pack mule,
my son gets a fair share.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.040
-It's fine, Dad. It's fine.
-No, the hell it is.

01:23:27.666 --> 01:23:30.376
When did you turn into a grade-A,
first-rate, certified,

01:23:30.458 --> 01:23:32.328
old, tired and crazy motherfucker?

01:23:32.416 --> 01:23:33.626
Ah, fuck you, man.

01:23:35.708 --> 01:23:38.038
When you've been cheated in life
as much as I have,

01:23:38.541 --> 01:23:42.421
you learn to spot the sign of all them
dirty rat bastards out there.

01:23:42.958 --> 01:23:45.378
-How much you need, huh? [grunts]
-[Paul] Huh?

01:23:47.333 --> 01:23:49.253
That enough? You want more?

01:23:49.333 --> 01:23:51.753
-Man, get that out of my fucking face.
-Huh?

01:23:53.333 --> 01:23:54.423
Do you remember?

01:23:56.458 --> 01:23:58.498
You remember what Norm said about money?

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.420
I don't remember that.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:10.328
No, no, no. I am sick and tired

01:24:10.916 --> 01:24:13.826
of trying to get you fools
to love one another.

01:24:13.916 --> 01:24:18.126
Go ahead! You wanna
tear each other apart, go on. Go on!

01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:20.630
Here I thought...

01:24:20.708 --> 01:24:24.168
I hoped that we could be Bloods
one more time.

01:24:24.666 --> 01:24:27.456
But, no, that ain't gonna never
happen again because of this.

01:24:28.666 --> 01:24:33.246
Traded brotherhood for this shit.
Right, Paul?

01:24:33.333 --> 01:24:35.503
That motherfucker
walks backward pigeon-toed.

01:24:35.583 --> 01:24:39.503
"Eddie, you black as a damn crow
Ain't white like snow

01:24:39.583 --> 01:24:40.833
And if you didn't know

01:24:40.916 --> 01:24:43.246
If you ain't got no dough
Then you don't go

01:24:43.333 --> 01:24:44.883
And that's for damn sure"

01:24:45.916 --> 01:24:48.956
-Yeah, well, my mama told me...
-[Paul laughing]

01:24:49.708 --> 01:24:53.458
...that money is the root of all--

01:24:54.583 --> 01:24:56.083
-[Melvin] Oh, shit!
-[Paul groans]

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:58.171
-Oh, my God!
-What the fuck?

01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:59.920
[Eddie screaming]

01:25:02.416 --> 01:25:03.246
Eddie.

01:25:03.333 --> 01:25:05.213
-[Melvin] Fuck.
-Oh! What?

01:25:05.291 --> 01:25:07.291
-Otis, don't move! It's a minefield!
-[Otis] Eddie!

01:25:07.375 --> 01:25:08.455
It's a minefield!

01:25:08.541 --> 01:25:10.961
-[Eddie screaming]
-[Melvin] Don't move, Otis.

01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:20.380
-Okay, okay, okay. Shh.
-[groaning]

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.630
[Otis] I got you. I got you. I got you.

01:25:24.708 --> 01:25:27.168
-I got you. I got you.
-[whimpers]

01:25:31.791 --> 01:25:34.081
-I got you.
-Bloods.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.040
[click]

01:25:48.583 --> 01:25:49.753
[David] Jesus!

01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:54.211
-Jesus!
-What?

01:25:54.291 --> 01:25:56.631
Jesus! Dad! Dad!
I think I stepped on something.

01:25:56.708 --> 01:25:59.668
-[Paul] Whoa! Stay right there.
-[David] Motherfucker!

01:25:59.750 --> 01:26:01.420
David, don't move. Don't move.

01:26:05.291 --> 01:26:07.171
-[Hedy] David!
-[Paul] Hey!

01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:08.710
-[Hedy] Everybody freeze!
-[Simon] Everybody okay?

01:26:08.791 --> 01:26:09.631
Hey!

01:26:09.708 --> 01:26:13.418
Dad, no, no! Put it down!
Put it down! They can help!

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:17.290
-We were just walking back to our camp.
-[Otis] He stepped on something.

01:26:17.375 --> 01:26:20.575
-Is it a pressure plate?
-Well, if it was, he would be dead.

01:26:20.666 --> 01:26:24.246
Uh, maybe it's a dud. Or maybe it's not.

01:26:24.333 --> 01:26:27.083
-We can help you. Look! Look! He can help.
-[device beeps]

01:26:30.875 --> 01:26:32.075
Okay, come on.

01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:41.083
And, David... don't move.

01:26:42.416 --> 01:26:43.916
What are we gonna do about my son?

01:26:44.458 --> 01:26:48.328
Well, all he can do is lift up his foot
and pray to God it doesn't explode.

01:26:49.958 --> 01:26:52.078
There's gotta be something else we can do.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.500
Well, if there is, I don't know it.

01:26:54.583 --> 01:26:57.883
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:27:01.125 --> 01:27:02.075
Jethro Bodine.

01:27:02.666 --> 01:27:04.286
-What?
-Who?

01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:07.171
Remember that big ol' hillbilly kid
from Oklahoma?

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:09.290
He stepped on a toe popper. Remember?

01:27:09.375 --> 01:27:11.825
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:27:11.916 --> 01:27:13.666
Okay, we're gonna spring my son...

01:27:14.208 --> 01:27:16.918
the same way we sprung
that hillbilly kid, you got me?

01:27:17.458 --> 01:27:18.878
[Otis] Yeah, that'll work. That'll work.

01:27:19.666 --> 01:27:20.576
Give me that rope.

01:27:26.166 --> 01:27:28.206
Where am I walking? Where am I walking?

01:27:28.708 --> 01:27:30.788
Straight to me, I swept it. You're good.
You're good.

01:27:33.333 --> 01:27:37.883
Do us both a favor.
Don't fucking shift your weight, okay?

01:27:38.541 --> 01:27:39.831
Stay right where you are.

01:27:39.916 --> 01:27:43.416
David, I want you to take this rope.

01:27:44.583 --> 01:27:49.633
I want you to wrap this rope
around your body. Two times.

01:27:49.708 --> 01:27:53.208
Go ahead. Twice around your body.

01:27:53.916 --> 01:27:57.286
Go on, like that. There you go.

01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:03.790
High as you can, man.
High as you can. Right.

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:17.673
[David grunts]

01:28:29.208 --> 01:28:33.538
David look at me.
Where did you go to college?

01:28:36.541 --> 01:28:38.461
-The House.
-The House.

01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:40.580
Who went to The House?

01:28:42.958 --> 01:28:45.918
-Come on.
-Edwin Moses. The class of '78.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.040
-Come on. What he'd do?
-Won two Olympic gold medals.

01:28:49.125 --> 01:28:51.035
-Yeah.
-Four hundred meter hurdles.

01:28:51.125 --> 01:28:55.245
He took 13 steps between each hurdle.
Everybody else took 15.

01:28:57.125 --> 01:29:01.075
David, that man could fly.

01:29:02.791 --> 01:29:04.131
What you gonna do?

01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:07.420
-What you gonna do, David?
-Fly.

01:29:08.125 --> 01:29:09.955
-Like?
-Fly like Moses.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.500
I want everybody
to take a piece of this rope.

01:29:18.583 --> 01:29:22.043
Back on up. Otis, back on up.

01:29:23.041 --> 01:29:26.631
Back it on up, man.
You, too, Mel. Back it on up.

01:29:26.708 --> 01:29:27.538
All right.

01:29:34.833 --> 01:29:36.793
-Here, take this.
-[Paul] That's good, big man.

01:29:36.875 --> 01:29:38.705
-That's good, big man! Right there.
-Yeah.

01:29:38.791 --> 01:29:40.001
Fuck. Fuck.

01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:42.383
-[Melvin] Get that slack!
-[Paul] Tighten up!

01:29:45.791 --> 01:29:49.211
Now, everybody...

01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:53.460
you get an armful and a handful of rope.

01:29:56.333 --> 01:29:57.963
-We good?
-We good.

01:29:58.041 --> 01:29:59.131
[Simon] I hear you.

01:29:59.208 --> 01:30:03.538
On count of three,
you pull harder than a motherfucker!

01:30:03.625 --> 01:30:04.455
[Otis] Yeah, baby.

01:30:05.458 --> 01:30:06.288
You got me?

01:30:06.375 --> 01:30:07.825
-[Otis] We got you, Blood.
-[Melvin] Got you.

01:30:08.208 --> 01:30:09.168
All right.

01:30:12.916 --> 01:30:14.076
One...

01:30:15.541 --> 01:30:16.581
two...

01:30:18.041 --> 01:30:18.881
three!

01:30:19.083 --> 01:30:20.333
[David screams]

01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:22.210
-Come on, man.
-[whimpers]

01:30:22.291 --> 01:30:23.921
[screaming]

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.880
-[Otis] God is great.
-[grunting]

01:30:30.458 --> 01:30:31.378
[Paul] Okay.

01:30:38.416 --> 01:30:39.876
All right. Now...

01:30:41.166 --> 01:30:43.326
-[Melvin] What the fuck?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:30:43.416 --> 01:30:46.706
Get on your knees. If you get...
Get on your fucking knees.

01:30:46.791 --> 01:30:49.461
-Dad.
-Put that damn gun down now!

01:30:49.541 --> 01:30:50.881
We're compromised, Melvin.

01:30:51.458 --> 01:30:54.378
Okay, okay, okay. Just take it easy now.

01:30:54.458 --> 01:30:57.828
Whatever you're doing,
it's none of our business. We can just go.

01:30:57.916 --> 01:31:01.496
Otis, the sound of those blasts
traveled, man.

01:31:02.125 --> 01:31:04.035
Somebody is on their way here right now.

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:06.535
-We gotta get the gold and get outta here.
-[Melvin] You serious?

01:31:06.625 --> 01:31:08.455
-We gotta get somebody for Eddie, Dad.
-Hey, man.

01:31:08.541 --> 01:31:10.001
American Embassy. Somebody.

01:31:10.083 --> 01:31:13.793
-We can't tell nobody nothing.
-Just slow the fuck down, man.

01:31:13.875 --> 01:31:15.165
We have to bury Eddie.

01:31:15.250 --> 01:31:18.080
Are you deaf, man?
Are you deaf? Are you deaf?

01:31:18.166 --> 01:31:19.746
We gotta get out of here, Otis!

01:31:19.833 --> 01:31:22.293
-I'm not leaving Eddie like that!
-I can be helpful to you.

01:31:22.791 --> 01:31:25.921
You can be helpful? Okay.

01:31:27.541 --> 01:31:30.211
Can you bring back the dead? Huh?

01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:34.210
-Get the rope, tie 'em up.
-[David] Not doing it.

01:31:34.291 --> 01:31:35.671
Let's just talk about it.

01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:38.920
Otis, you ain't giving the orders, man.
I'm running shit now.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.830
[Paul grunting]

01:31:42.416 --> 01:31:44.126
Dad! Dad!

01:31:44.208 --> 01:31:47.828
Dad nothing. Dad nothing. Dad nothing!

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.420
[panting]

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:55.580
Boy, I've killed far better men than you,

01:31:55.666 --> 01:31:59.916
and I will not hesitate
to plug a hole in you right now.

01:32:01.541 --> 01:32:04.211
David, tie 'em up.

01:32:06.208 --> 01:32:07.208
[coughing]

01:32:07.958 --> 01:32:11.788
You want your share? Tie 'em up.

01:32:13.083 --> 01:32:14.673
You wanna remain my son?

01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:20.580
Get at it. Get at it.

01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:28.165
Come here, son. Come here. Come here.

01:32:29.458 --> 01:32:31.288
-All right.
-[David] Give me your hand.

01:32:35.083 --> 01:32:36.333
You had me fooled.

01:32:44.875 --> 01:32:50.245
You got something to say?
You say it to me. Not my son.

01:32:58.416 --> 01:32:59.826
Let me tell y'all something.

01:33:00.416 --> 01:33:01.786
I'm the motherfucker.

01:33:03.291 --> 01:33:05.921
I... am the motherfucker.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.210
I'm the motherfucker.
I'm the motherfucker.

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.131
So long, Blood.

01:33:19.625 --> 01:33:20.955
Rest in power.

01:33:23.583 --> 01:33:24.423
Amen.

01:33:25.375 --> 01:33:26.375
-Amen.
-Amen.

01:33:30.416 --> 01:33:32.536
We should give Eddie's share
to his family.

01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:36.325
It's the right thing to do, y'all.

01:33:39.666 --> 01:33:40.666
And David?

01:33:43.791 --> 01:33:46.041
That's my boy. He deserves a fair share.

01:33:50.083 --> 01:33:50.923
Deal?

01:33:53.208 --> 01:33:54.828
-[together] Deal.
-All right.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.130
[Seppo] I can't believe I was actually...
jealous of you, back at that bar.

01:34:30.958 --> 01:34:34.708
Yeah. You seemed
so fuckin' sure of yourself.

01:34:35.541 --> 01:34:40.501
Should've known you're actually
just a spineless fucking rat.

01:34:41.166 --> 01:34:45.746
Hedy, you can't still want this guy.
Look at him, his father's gonna kill us.

01:34:45.833 --> 01:34:47.083
Seppo, shut up.

01:34:47.708 --> 01:34:50.288
Well, your father scares me
more than landmines.

01:34:50.833 --> 01:34:52.463
[Paul] Shut the hell up, up there.

01:34:57.041 --> 01:34:58.581
-Yeah, over here.
-Here?

01:34:58.666 --> 01:34:59.706
[Otis] Mmm-hmm.

01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:03.250
Take us about a day, and we get to...

01:35:09.583 --> 01:35:13.173
You be careful with this OxyContin shit.
It can be addictive.

01:35:14.791 --> 01:35:15.831
[chuckles]

01:35:20.375 --> 01:35:23.165
-Where were we?
-What about right here?

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:25.960
-But I think that Vinh should--
-Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

01:35:26.625 --> 01:35:29.575
Vinh is out. He in cahoots with Charlie.

01:35:32.125 --> 01:35:33.455
Ain't that right, traitor?

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
If you don't trust me by now...

01:35:40.583 --> 01:35:44.383
just shoot me... when you kill them.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
What the hell is that?

01:35:55.916 --> 01:36:00.536
Night vision, baby. Night vision.
Let's see what's shaking.

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:06.080
I need to urinate.

01:36:07.333 --> 01:36:10.543
-She needs to pee.
-Yeah, I heard her. I'm not deaf.

01:36:11.250 --> 01:36:13.880
Yeah, I know the Geneva Convention's
off the table,

01:36:13.958 --> 01:36:15.578
but maybe just let her take a piss.

01:36:16.458 --> 01:36:19.998
Well, could you untie my hands? Please.

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:21.880
You gotta go, you gotta go.

01:36:25.541 --> 01:36:26.581
Fast, all right?

01:36:32.791 --> 01:36:33.881
[in French]

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.580
-[in English] To the tree.
-[speaking French]

01:36:40.666 --> 01:36:45.076
[in English] David, don't you want
the first time I unzip and remove my pants

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:47.036
to be under better circumstances?

01:36:48.541 --> 01:36:49.791
[urinating]

01:36:49.875 --> 01:36:50.915
[Hedy exclaims]

01:36:52.458 --> 01:36:53.958
[Hedy sighs in relief]

01:36:54.041 --> 01:36:58.711
Were you flirting with me the other night
because you were looking for an easy fuck

01:36:58.791 --> 01:37:01.331
or because you were
actually interested in me?

01:37:01.875 --> 01:37:05.035
-Actually, I'm interested.
-Uh-huh?

01:37:08.875 --> 01:37:14.745
Yeah. You left your wealthy family behind
to do something good, help people, kids.

01:37:17.541 --> 01:37:20.331
And you're fine, too. I ain't gonna lie.

01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:24.170
Wow. Then let me go. [chuckles]

01:37:26.041 --> 01:37:30.251
Give me a ten-minute head start.
All I ask, please?

01:37:32.541 --> 01:37:33.381
Hmm?

01:37:34.166 --> 01:37:38.416
You know, I hate to cockblock.
She cute, though.

01:37:40.583 --> 01:37:42.173
Mel, take her back to the tree.

01:37:43.291 --> 01:37:45.381
You better listen to your pop, son.

01:37:45.458 --> 01:37:49.328
You're a worthless fuck. Just so you know,
I was only trying to escape.

01:37:49.416 --> 01:37:51.576
I wouldn't fuck you
for all the gold in the world.

01:37:51.666 --> 01:37:52.826
[in French]

01:37:55.875 --> 01:37:56.875
[Paul laughing]

01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:17.580
Just what I thought. Just what I thought.

01:38:25.625 --> 01:38:28.125
Mel, you make sure that rope is tight.

01:38:28.208 --> 01:38:29.998
-[Melvin] Oh, yeah.
-[David] Hey, Dad.

01:38:30.666 --> 01:38:31.786
Okay. Okay.

01:38:32.416 --> 01:38:33.706
-[Paul groans] God damn!
-[David] Get the gun!

01:38:33.791 --> 01:38:35.421
-[Paul] God damn!
-[Otis] I got the gun.

01:38:35.500 --> 01:38:37.880
Drag his ass over there.
Drag his ass over there.

01:38:37.958 --> 01:38:39.708
-Seppo's loose! Give me the gun!
-[Paul] Get him.

01:38:39.791 --> 01:38:42.081
-[Otis] I'll crack your head open!
-[Seppo panting]

01:38:43.458 --> 01:38:46.708
[Paul groans] I knew it! I knew it!

01:38:46.791 --> 01:38:51.711
[laughs] Another motherfucking
dope fiend double-cross.

01:38:52.833 --> 01:38:55.583
David, you don't see what Otis is doing?

01:38:56.166 --> 01:38:59.246
You're playin' into his fuckin' hands!

01:39:00.375 --> 01:39:03.325
Your dear mother would be ashamed of you!

01:39:04.708 --> 01:39:08.208
Yeah, you ain't no fuckin' son of mine!

01:39:09.250 --> 01:39:10.880
You're dead to me. You hear me?

01:39:10.958 --> 01:39:13.078
-[Otis] Get the rope.
-[Paul] Gone! Buried!

01:39:13.166 --> 01:39:15.166
-[Otis] Get the rope.
-[Paul] You're a fucking coward.

01:39:15.250 --> 01:39:17.540
-Fucking disgrace!
-Get the rope! Get the rope, David.

01:39:17.625 --> 01:39:20.665
Don't get shit. You stay your ass
right the fuck there.

01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:23.960
You stay your ass right the fuck there!
[growls]

01:39:48.458 --> 01:39:50.288
You've had quite an adventure.

01:39:51.833 --> 01:39:53.583
-My friend, let me help.
-Oh, no.

01:39:53.666 --> 01:39:55.996
I got it, I got it. Thank you.
Thank you, I got it.

01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:57.380
Hey.

01:39:58.791 --> 01:39:59.921
[panting]

01:40:04.958 --> 01:40:06.038
[David grunts]

01:40:08.125 --> 01:40:10.125
-Get this off of me.
-Where's Eddie?

01:40:11.875 --> 01:40:15.745
[panting] Broke his ankle.
We left him with food and water.

01:40:20.083 --> 01:40:21.543
He insisted.

01:40:23.166 --> 01:40:25.246
That boy is stubborn as an old mule.

01:40:29.958 --> 01:40:31.918
-[Vinh] Sounds very bad.
-[Otis] Yeah.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.920
I knew you should not have gone alone.

01:40:35.083 --> 01:40:37.923
I have a friend in the district.
He'll send a rescue group.

01:40:38.458 --> 01:40:41.958
How would you like to earn more money
than you ever earned in your whole life?

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:49.580
Eddie didn't break an ankle, did he?

01:40:51.625 --> 01:40:53.205
No. Help me.

01:40:55.375 --> 01:40:56.245
You kill him?

01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:58.290
Oh, God, no.

01:41:00.416 --> 01:41:01.416
Minefield.

01:41:02.125 --> 01:41:03.245
Otis!

01:41:03.333 --> 01:41:04.793
-Huh?
-Here come your partners.

01:41:09.916 --> 01:41:11.206
[Otis] Ain't no partners of mine.

01:41:11.791 --> 01:41:12.671
[Seppo] Hedy!

01:41:13.583 --> 01:41:15.333
-Hedy!
-[Hedy] Seppo!

01:41:15.416 --> 01:41:16.746
[Simon] Seppo! Seppo!

01:41:16.916 --> 01:41:19.786
[man grunts, speaks in Vietnamese]

01:41:20.583 --> 01:41:24.043
[in Vietnamese]

01:41:25.166 --> 01:41:27.326
-[in English] He said you have his gold.
-[Paul speaking Vietnamese]

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000
[in English] Forget that.

01:41:30.416 --> 01:41:32.746
[in English] We trade
your friend for gold.

01:41:32.833 --> 01:41:33.833
He ain't our friend!

01:41:33.916 --> 01:41:35.536
-What?
-You heard me.

01:41:35.625 --> 01:41:38.495
Hedy, for God's sakes, help me.

01:41:38.583 --> 01:41:40.213
[Hedy] David, you've got to help him.

01:41:41.208 --> 01:41:42.288
Otis?

01:41:43.583 --> 01:41:44.543
Please.

01:41:49.291 --> 01:41:50.671
We want him alive.

01:42:03.541 --> 01:42:05.001
-Fuck!
-Fuck.

01:42:07.916 --> 01:42:08.956
[Otis] We can share.

01:42:09.041 --> 01:42:10.501
[men speaking Vietnamese]

01:42:10.583 --> 01:42:12.423
There's enough for everybody.

01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:14.330
[in Vietnamese]

01:42:17.791 --> 01:42:18.751
What's he saying?

01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:20.920
[in English] I like you.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.630
Black Uncle Sam. We share.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.960
-This for you, rest for us.
-[David] Hey!

01:42:30.041 --> 01:42:31.541
Look, man, we're Americans, all right?

01:42:31.625 --> 01:42:35.625
You kill us or hurt him, you got
an international fiasco on your hands.

01:42:35.708 --> 01:42:39.038
We're not gonna kill anyone... yet.

01:42:40.333 --> 01:42:41.293
[Otis] You heard him.

01:42:41.791 --> 01:42:43.881
Nobody gets nothing. Nothing!

01:42:44.375 --> 01:42:49.745
Black Uncle Sam, this is belong
to Vietnamese people.

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:51.710
We take what is ours.

01:42:51.791 --> 01:42:53.711
Hey, boy, you ain't taking what's ours.

01:42:53.791 --> 01:42:58.001
You look on that gold bar right there,
it says USA, my friend.

01:42:58.083 --> 01:43:00.003
You, USA?

01:43:00.083 --> 01:43:01.083
Damn skippy.

01:43:02.166 --> 01:43:05.326
-It say USA, but I don't think so.
-Well, you better believe it.

01:43:06.333 --> 01:43:07.883
Who the fuck are you, man?

01:43:08.791 --> 01:43:10.581
-[man] We?
-Uh-huh. You.

01:43:10.666 --> 01:43:11.746
Vietnam officer.

01:43:11.833 --> 01:43:14.383
Oh, yeah? Where are your official badges?

01:43:16.166 --> 01:43:18.876
We don't need no stinkin' official badges.

01:43:20.708 --> 01:43:22.628
Do you know Calley, brother?

01:43:24.916 --> 01:43:27.786
Yeah. And first of all,
you ain't my brother,

01:43:28.458 --> 01:43:30.458
and I know California, yeah.

01:43:31.041 --> 01:43:32.631
You imbecile.

01:43:33.125 --> 01:43:34.625
It's not a state.

01:43:35.250 --> 01:43:38.920
Lt. Calley. Ever heard of My Lai?

01:43:40.166 --> 01:43:41.956
I know all about My Lai.

01:43:42.041 --> 01:43:44.921
And you, GI murder,

01:43:45.416 --> 01:43:48.996
killer of innocent children and babies.

01:43:49.083 --> 01:43:50.963
[Paul]  There were atrocities
on both sides.

01:43:51.041 --> 01:43:53.381
So why don't you go chew on
some motherfucking chopsticks?

01:43:53.458 --> 01:43:55.038
-Chill, chill, chill.
-No, no, fuck him!

01:43:57.625 --> 01:43:58.535
[Paul grunts]

01:44:01.625 --> 01:44:05.665
"Make America great again."
I show you something!

01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:06.830
[both grunting]

01:44:08.916 --> 01:44:10.496
[fighting grunts]

01:44:13.791 --> 01:44:15.501
[shouting]

01:44:17.416 --> 01:44:19.626
-[Hedy screams] Simon!
-Oh, fuck!

01:44:19.708 --> 01:44:21.128
[screaming]

01:44:22.791 --> 01:44:24.001
[yelling]

01:44:25.375 --> 01:44:27.995
-Chavy! Chavy!
-[man screaming]

01:44:28.083 --> 01:44:29.753
-[Hedy] Simon! [screams]
-[David] Stay down!

01:44:29.833 --> 01:44:31.463
Come on! Come on!

01:44:32.208 --> 01:44:34.668
[indistinct shouts in Vietnamese]

01:44:35.375 --> 01:44:36.745
[man yelling]

01:44:40.708 --> 01:44:41.628
[man] Chavy!

01:44:54.666 --> 01:44:56.626
[rapid gunfire echoing]

01:44:56.708 --> 01:44:58.708
[gunshots continue]

01:44:59.083 --> 01:45:00.833
[Paul grunting and panting]

01:45:04.666 --> 01:45:05.666
Where's Norm?

01:45:06.208 --> 01:45:08.378
-He's gone, man. KIA.
-Oh!

01:45:09.375 --> 01:45:11.205
Đi đi mau!  Let's move.

01:45:11.291 --> 01:45:12.881
-Go ahead. Go ahead!
-Đi đi mau!

01:45:12.958 --> 01:45:14.498
Go ahead. I got this.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.080
[David groans]

01:45:19.958 --> 01:45:21.248
[Otis] Okay. All right, okay.

01:45:21.833 --> 01:45:23.083
-Mel!
-[Melvin] Yeah, man.

01:45:23.166 --> 01:45:24.416
-Bring a first aid kit.
-[Melvin] Yeah.

01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:27.000
-And a satellite phone.
-[Hedy speaking indistinctly]

01:45:28.250 --> 01:45:29.580
[Hedy] He's just gone!

01:45:29.666 --> 01:45:32.706
-[groaning] Otis.
-[Otis] All right. Roll over. Roll over.

01:45:32.791 --> 01:45:36.631
Turn... I know, turn over. Turn over.
Clean through and through.

01:45:36.708 --> 01:45:37.918
[sobbing]

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:41.710
-[Otis] Press this on. Press it down.
-[Hedy] Seppo.

01:45:41.791 --> 01:45:45.791
I know, boy. I know.
There you go. All right.

01:45:45.875 --> 01:45:47.165
Just keep the pressure on.

01:45:48.583 --> 01:45:50.543
Breathe through it.
Just breathe through it. Keep on going.

01:45:50.625 --> 01:45:51.575
[liquid trickling]

01:45:51.666 --> 01:45:55.286
Keep on. All right. Press this.
Press this on.

01:45:55.375 --> 01:45:58.495
Here we go. Press it on. Press it on!

01:45:58.583 --> 01:46:01.833
Press it. Press it tight.
All right, I know. I know. I know.

01:46:01.916 --> 01:46:04.166
I know, come on. All right, you got this.

01:46:04.916 --> 01:46:08.036
-Move your hand! I know.
-[David panting and groaning]

01:46:08.125 --> 01:46:10.495
[Otis] There you go.
Man, it's gotta be tight.

01:46:15.583 --> 01:46:16.673
Clean through and through.

01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:19.170
[David continues groaning]

01:46:20.333 --> 01:46:21.793
-[Otis] There you go. Hold on.
-Hey!

01:46:21.875 --> 01:46:24.375
Straighten up! Straighten up!

01:46:25.083 --> 01:46:26.253
[David groaning]

01:46:27.250 --> 01:46:30.330
[Otis] All right. All right, hold on.
It's all right.

01:46:30.416 --> 01:46:31.456
How he doin'?

01:46:31.541 --> 01:46:34.581
-[Otis] You'll survive. You'll survive.
-How's he doing, man?

01:46:34.666 --> 01:46:35.786
[groans]

01:46:35.875 --> 01:46:37.705
[Otis] That's nothing but a mosquito bite.

01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:40.131
-[Paul] Don't fuck it up, man.
-[Otis] Come on. Come on.

01:46:40.208 --> 01:46:41.748
[screaming]

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.330
[Otis] Man the hell up.

01:46:45.083 --> 01:46:47.883
-All right. All right. All right.
-Okay, look...

01:46:49.458 --> 01:46:52.878
First thing that gook's gonna do
when he gets back to town,

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:58.170
he gonna round up
all the local muscle he can. Now look.

01:46:59.750 --> 01:47:00.710
Who you callin'?

01:47:01.208 --> 01:47:03.958
I'm calling Tiên.
She can get us out of here.

01:47:04.041 --> 01:47:05.171
[phone beeping]

01:47:05.583 --> 01:47:07.753
-What the fuck you do that for?
-[Otis] What the fuck...

01:47:07.833 --> 01:47:10.463
-I should shoot your crazy ass dead.
-[Paul] Do it.

01:47:14.208 --> 01:47:16.328
Ain't nothing to it but to do it, Blood.

01:47:17.083 --> 01:47:18.713
Don't tempt me, motherfucker.

01:47:18.791 --> 01:47:21.251
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

01:47:22.416 --> 01:47:23.416
[Vinh] Brother.

01:47:27.458 --> 01:47:29.288
We have very little gas left.

01:47:29.833 --> 01:47:33.133
Perhaps enough gas
to get to the temple ruin.

01:47:33.208 --> 01:47:35.628
-A few miles from here.
-[Otis] What do we achieve by that, huh?

01:47:36.916 --> 01:47:39.916
If you wanna choose to fight these men,
you need some defenses.

01:47:40.708 --> 01:47:45.918
Otis, try doing the math, huh?
Tiên is with the V.C.

01:47:46.541 --> 01:47:49.331
Otis, that's how they knew
about the gold, man.

01:47:49.416 --> 01:47:54.326
That's how this whole fucking ambush
was a setup! Mel?

01:47:54.416 --> 01:47:55.536
[Melvin] You know Tiên?

01:47:56.458 --> 01:47:57.628
No, I do not.

01:47:57.708 --> 01:47:59.538
And you expect him to tell the truth.

01:48:00.833 --> 01:48:04.253
Okay, look here. Look here, man. Okay.

01:48:05.041 --> 01:48:07.501
We gonna cut through the jungle
to a river.

01:48:08.583 --> 01:48:12.923
To a village, Hng Ng.
Right there, Hng Ng.

01:48:13.708 --> 01:48:16.288
Wait till nightfall.
We gonna rip off a boat,

01:48:16.375 --> 01:48:18.455
and then we skirt past Tân Châu.

01:48:18.541 --> 01:48:20.041
-[Simon] Hey, guys! No!
-Tân Châu.

01:48:20.916 --> 01:48:23.666
We can't go there.
That's 20 miles away from here.

01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:27.580
So what? You scared of
a little bit of exercise, fat boy? Huh?

01:48:27.666 --> 01:48:29.576
[Otis] David's leg won't handle that.

01:48:29.666 --> 01:48:33.036
[voice breaks]
David ain't my problem... anymore.

01:48:33.125 --> 01:48:34.495
Man, David is your son.

01:48:35.166 --> 01:48:36.166
My son...

01:48:41.125 --> 01:48:42.325
is a backstabber.

01:48:51.666 --> 01:48:52.956
Are you with us or not?

01:48:55.208 --> 01:48:58.918
My share is my share. You do what you want
with his share. Hear me?

01:49:01.083 --> 01:49:03.083
Listen, you crazy fuck!

01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:07.920
-Norman wouldn't want us to split up.
-That's right. He wouldn't.

01:49:09.458 --> 01:49:13.998
And that's my problem. Ah.
That's my problem, Otis.

01:49:14.875 --> 01:49:19.535
Stormin' Norm ain't with the living.
You feel me?

01:49:21.916 --> 01:49:22.956
My problem.

01:49:29.375 --> 01:49:30.535
Peace out!

01:49:33.958 --> 01:49:34.918
[grunts]

01:49:38.125 --> 01:49:39.035
[exclaims]

01:49:41.333 --> 01:49:44.133
[sobbing and yelling]

01:49:48.958 --> 01:49:50.418
[screaming]

01:49:54.083 --> 01:49:56.793
[screams continue]

01:49:58.625 --> 01:50:02.075
[Paul] "The Lord is my shepherd!
I shall not want!

01:50:02.166 --> 01:50:05.246
He maketh me lie down in green pastures!

01:50:05.333 --> 01:50:10.293
He leadeth me beside the still waters!
He restoreth my soul!

01:50:10.375 --> 01:50:16.535
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for His name's sake!

01:50:16.625 --> 01:50:20.245
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

01:50:20.333 --> 01:50:24.003
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.

01:50:24.083 --> 01:50:29.083
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me!"

01:50:29.166 --> 01:50:30.576
[Paul continues crying in distance]
