WEBVTT

00:04.271 --> 00:05.504
Here.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.739
You give to me your phone?

00:06.741 --> 00:08.073
Yeah, I got an upgrade.

00:08.075 --> 00:09.808
I already have a phone.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.243
This is a smartphone.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.780
Hmm. And this is a smartbelt.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.350
Phone, radio, pager.
Everything I need.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.085
How can you
still need a pager?

00:20.087 --> 00:21.447
That's how umma
find me when I out.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.222
But wouldn't it be cool

00:23.224 --> 00:24.423
To check Jays scores
on your phone?

00:24.425 --> 00:25.591
That's what the radio is for.

00:25.593 --> 00:26.625
We could FaceTime.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.627
I don't need to see you face
when you not working in store.

00:28.629 --> 00:32.698
And can a smartphone keep
a pants from falling down?

00:32.700 --> 00:35.267
No, but it can do this.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.703
When did South Korea
become a country?

00:37.705 --> 00:39.204
Smart phone voice:
<i>The Republic of Korea</i>

00:39.206 --> 00:41.507
<i>Celebrated its first
National Day of Independence</i>

00:41.509 --> 00:43.742
<i>On august 15th, 1945.</i>

00:43.744 --> 00:45.077
Okay, give to me your phone.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.846
Hmm. Thank you
for old smartphone.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.582
And for you, old smartbelt.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.217
Hmm? Retro cool.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.719
Maybe add a few notch, huh?

00:56.490 --> 00:57.823
Who invent Korea alphabet?

00:57.825 --> 00:59.224
Hello?

01:20.114 --> 01:21.180
Oh.

01:21.315 --> 01:23.315
Remember to get Pokemon-gx.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.217
- It's "gx" not "dx."
- yeah.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.319
Use voice memo
in new phone or you forget.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.555
I don't need voice memo.
I remember.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.223
Then how come
you don't remember

01:31.225 --> 01:32.324
How to use a voice memo?

01:32.326 --> 01:34.426
I know how to
use a voice memo.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.462
I just choose brain
over technology.

01:36.730 --> 01:40.466
One day, when robot take over,
you thank me.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.334
After you thank robot.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.362
Oh!

02:10.531 --> 02:12.364
I thought you was raccoon.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.500
Out. Out. Out. Out.

02:16.203 --> 02:17.269
Out!

02:17.538 --> 02:18.604
No, out.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.305
Out. Out.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.517
Is that your dog?

02:31.919 --> 02:33.218
Nope.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.462
We should go to
The Golden Rabbit tonight.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.663
I don't like dim sum.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.964
The women with
the carts there,

02:45.966 --> 02:47.232
They always make me feel like

02:47.234 --> 02:48.433
I don't know
what I'm ordering.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.269
Also, I don't know
what I'm ordering.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.004
Plus, everyone from
school goes there.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.805
Fine, then we can do pizza.

02:55.743 --> 02:56.242
See, I can't.

02:56.243 --> 02:56.742
- I'm going to Dree's gallery opening.
- Why?

02:56.744 --> 02:57.809
We're friends.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.251
We have a couple
of classes together.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.513
I'm in those classes, too.
Why wasn't I invited?

03:01.515 --> 03:02.714
You don't even like her.

03:02.716 --> 03:03.782
You always say
she's pretentious.

03:03.784 --> 03:04.850
Thank you so much.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.451
Wait. Maybe I was invited.

03:06.453 --> 03:07.786
New phone.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.388
Sometimes it takes a few days

03:09.390 --> 03:11.223
For it to get all sorted with
the networks and data.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.291
Phone jet lag.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.293
I can just ask her.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.794
- Hey, Dree!
- No, don't.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.496
Oh. I'll see you later.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.431
Hey, G. You should
come early tonight.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.499
I think it's gonna be busy.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.800
I'm super stoked.

03:21.802 --> 03:22.734
Congratulations.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.536
It's super cool that
you have a solo show.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.571
You're so young.

03:25.573 --> 03:26.705
I guess.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.940
Annie Leibovitz was 23

03:29.009 --> 03:31.054
When she was the chief
photographer at <i>Rolling Stone.</i>

03:31.078 --> 03:32.644
And that was a different time.
The '70s.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.479
But you know, the '70s
were a different time.

03:34.481 --> 03:35.781
The past.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.250
Cool. Um, do you go to OCAD?

03:38.485 --> 03:40.819
Yeah,
I was just in class with you.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.621
She's my roommate.

03:42.623 --> 03:43.755
And good friend.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.625
Friend roommate sort of thing.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.428
I'm Janet.
Just hanging tonight.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.931
- Go where the wind takes me.
- Sweet.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.900
Uh, I gotta get going.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.034
You know,
I wanna get a big chill-in

03:56.036 --> 03:57.369
Before I have to
be on all night.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.737
Introvert problems,
am I right?

03:58.739 --> 03:59.972
Exactly.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.206
Totally.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.342
- Uh, okay, I'll see you.
- See you.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.644
Well, I tried.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.715
Yeah, maybe try less
next time. A little less.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.617
Dude, my mouth
still tastes like lychee.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.719
Oh. My mouth still
tastes like lady danger.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.988
It's that lipstick
that girl Sabrina was wearing.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.889
- How do you know?
- I always ask.

04:18.425 --> 04:19.524
There it is.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.760
Cinderella story.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.829
Except, at midnight
my willpower tanked.

04:23.831 --> 04:26.365
Dude, you fail as my
late-night binge sponsor.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.033
It is too dangerous

04:28.035 --> 04:31.336
Getting in-between
drunk Jung and the samosas.

04:31.538 --> 04:32.738
Those were tasty.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.039
That was a good call from...

04:34.041 --> 04:35.841
What's-her-name,
the bass player.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.743
- Oh, super hot bass player?
- Yeah.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.279
- You should totally call her.
- Definitely.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.080
Definitely.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.348
You didn't get her number?

04:43.350 --> 04:44.583
I gave her my number.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.051
And then, that guy
fell off the speaker,

04:46.053 --> 04:47.352
And then, I had to go, and...

04:47.721 --> 04:49.087
The next thing was samosas.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.623
That's too bad. She was cool.

04:52.726 --> 04:53.992
And hot!

04:53.994 --> 04:54.860
She'll call.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.728
Why are you always
so sure of yourself?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.498
That's why.

05:00.034 --> 05:01.300
It's Janet.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.035
Yup.

05:03.037 --> 05:04.536
What's up?

05:06.740 --> 05:07.573
Wanna do dim sum tonight?

05:07.574 --> 05:08.407
Uh, Kimchee and I are watching
Pirates of the Caribbean.

05:08.409 --> 05:09.775
You've planned to do that?

05:09.777 --> 05:10.942
Isn't it something
that just happens?

05:10.944 --> 05:12.477
<i>You can come over if you want.</i>

05:12.780 --> 05:13.912
Ugh. I hate those movies.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.480
Another time then.

05:16.350 --> 05:17.616
I'll bring snacks.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.950
Didn't you just say
you hated those movies?

05:18.952 --> 05:21.119
I do, but I can hate-watch.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.455
Love sarcastic comments
all the way through a movie.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.523
That's the spirit.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.734
Smart phone voice:
<i>The annexation of Korea</i>

05:29.430 --> 05:31.797
<i>By Japan was set up in the
Japan-Korea treaty of 1910.</i>

05:31.799 --> 05:33.699
No! They attack Korea.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.801
<i>Looking up
taquerias in your area.</i>

05:35.803 --> 05:37.703
No, I talking Japan.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.439
<i>Mi Casa Taqueria,
5850 Bloor Street West.</i>

05:40.441 --> 05:41.506
Stop.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.708
<i>Taco Taco, 829 Carlton street.</i>

05:44.678 --> 05:45.744
Stop.

05:45.745 --> 05:46.811
That blasted taqueria.
It's taken away my business.

05:46.814 --> 05:47.946
And with what?

05:47.948 --> 05:50.382
Bits of fish
wrapped in corn paper,

05:52.319 --> 05:53.218
Drowned in mayonnaise.

05:53.219 --> 05:54.764
Argh. Now I'm on the podcast.
What's a podcast?

05:54.788 --> 05:56.488
- New phone?
- New old phone.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.756
Give to me your number.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.991
That's a little forward,
but okay.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.061
Finally, a smartphone.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.696
I have so many gifs
to send you.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.932
I already see Kermit
drinking tea.

06:07.735 --> 06:08.934
Your son's number is in here.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.669
What?

06:12.439 --> 06:13.505
Hmm.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.341
Yeah, must be from, uh, Janet.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.512
Yeah,
I clean up contact later.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.713
Hmm.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.117
Street creature. Kill it.

06:25.119 --> 06:26.752
It's just a stinky dog.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.487
- My instruction stands.
- Yeah.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.788
I thought you get rid of.

06:29.790 --> 06:30.822
I try.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.859
I don't understand this
north American pet obsession.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.161
Dogs should remain outside
where they can run wild,

06:36.163 --> 06:37.629
Eat garbage,

06:37.631 --> 06:39.498
And copulate behind
my restaurant, apparently.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.634
Other day, I see
a dog in a baby stroller

06:42.636 --> 06:43.902
And the baby on a leash.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.972
Don't give me
your puppy-dog eye.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.073
It not work.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.442
Yeah, it's true.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.852
Happy birthday!

07:00.854 --> 07:01.853
Not my birthday.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.156
Late present.
You want dog when you was 10.

07:04.158 --> 07:06.425
- Hi, Mrs. Kim.
- Oh, hi, Ms. Shannon.

07:06.427 --> 07:07.659
Whose dog is this?

07:07.661 --> 07:08.860
Sorry, my umma
just brought it in.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.996
Well, this is no place
for a dog,

07:10.998 --> 07:14.800
Because I am going to gobble
this little love monster up.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.035
Aw! What's his or her name?

07:17.571 --> 07:18.837
Uh, Carol.

07:18.839 --> 07:19.938
Oh, is she a rescue?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.873
I don't know.
I just find in store.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.809
Now Jung take
and I go wholesale.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.010
Uh, no, umma, no way.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.746
Then what I do? So busy today.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.080
Oh, who's a good girl

07:29.082 --> 07:30.749
Who needs cuddles
to feel better about herself?

07:30.751 --> 07:32.150
And who's gonna
give me those cuddles?

07:32.152 --> 07:33.418
You can take her
to the shelter,

07:34.421 --> 07:35.732
But if she doesn't get adopted
in the first few days,

07:35.756 --> 07:36.756
They'll take care of her.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.898
Can't you just, uh,
take care of her?

07:39.493 --> 07:41.827
No, "take care"
means put down.

07:41.829 --> 07:42.829
Okay.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.197
- Like, to sleep.
- Okay.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.599
- Like, forever.
- Yeah, I know
what "take care" is.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.000
Well, I'm not
"taking care" of her.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.268
- Well, I'll take care of her.
- Yeah?

07:50.270 --> 07:51.837
Well, I mean,
the cats won't be happy,

07:51.839 --> 07:52.971
But, you know,
par for the course

07:52.973 --> 07:54.093
For those two little grumps.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.141
Okay, so you take care.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.676
Okay, bye.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.111
Who's gonna get
their own Instagram account?

08:00.113 --> 08:00.946
I am.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.914
And Carol will be
heavily featured.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.149
Won't you, Carol?

08:06.954 --> 08:08.954
- It's gotta be her.
- Yeah.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.489
Looks like
- a hot girl's number.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.656
Lot of eights.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.791
Back on track.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.092
Whoa!

08:14.094 --> 08:15.827
She made the first move.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.530
She called, didn't text,
didn't leave a voicemail.

08:18.532 --> 08:19.532
She's a pro.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.166
How you respond
sets up the whole dynamic.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.467
I'm calling her.

08:23.437 --> 08:24.202
You know who calls girls
in the middle of the day?

08:24.204 --> 08:28.139
Sweatpants guy
eating a pop-tart, untoasted.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.241
Don't be that guy.

08:29.243 --> 08:31.042
Yeah, but she called me.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.978
Trust me. Just text her.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.747
E-communication is my forte.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.283
One question,
one neutral statement,

08:38.285 --> 08:40.552
And one panda
emoticon equals date.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.955
How are you?

08:45.259 --> 08:48.093
Just at work.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.129
- Panda emoticon.
- All right. Send.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.371
You gotta wait
at least an hour.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.832
Fine.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.314
Okay, I can't guarantee
results if you don't listen.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.271
Dude,
I know how to talk to girls.

08:59.273 --> 09:02.674
You didn't get her name,
number, or lipstick color.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.943
The problem is, these cyclists
have too much power.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.746
You can't touch them.
Not even a nudge.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.115
I do enjoy
watching the cyclists

09:10.117 --> 09:11.249
On the Olympics, though.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.985
The legs on those athletes
is astounding.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.187
Enormous meat pistons.

09:17.090 --> 09:20.292
If someone text send you
a panda message,

09:20.294 --> 09:21.726
What's that mean?

09:21.728 --> 09:23.161
Who sent you a panda?

09:23.163 --> 09:24.163
Uh, nobody.

09:25.032 --> 09:28.033
Just thinking about
sending one to Mrs. Kim.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.067
Sounds fun.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.903
Send one from me
if it's not inappropriate.

09:31.905 --> 09:32.938
Yeah.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.943
Hey, she said, "good."

09:38.812 --> 09:40.879
"good"? Who says just "good"?

09:40.881 --> 09:42.647
Cool bass players
playing it cool.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.049
You gotta be careful here.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.650
She called,
you didn't pick up...

09:45.652 --> 09:46.985
"I'm glad you're good."

09:46.987 --> 09:48.620
She's trying to
maintain power.

09:48.622 --> 09:49.654
No!

09:50.757 --> 09:52.591
Look like she have
fun last night.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.226
Huh. Have trouble
getting to work this morning.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.728
- Why?
- I don't know.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.031
"Why?"

10:00.267 --> 10:01.333
Uh...

10:02.202 --> 10:06.304
- "probably the boilermakers."
- that's good.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.708
What's a bowling maker?

10:09.710 --> 10:10.976
What?

10:10.978 --> 10:12.322
- Uh, boiling marker?
- Let me see.

10:12.346 --> 10:13.878
- Uh... No.
- Jung?

10:14.615 --> 10:15.947
You're texting with Jung.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.751
A boilermaker is a drink.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.720
A shot glass of whiskey
plunged into a beer.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.155
Delicious and
quite debilitating.

10:24.424 --> 10:27.726
Like poktan-ju, in Korea.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.127
Hey.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.696
What's a poktan-ju?

10:32.265 --> 10:34.866
She wants to poke
your tanned juju, dude.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.868
Yeah, or bad auto-correct.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.137
Can I...

10:39.139 --> 10:40.372
"...See you tonight?"

10:41.208 --> 10:42.774
I'm gobsmacked.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.478
"How about we meet
back at the exodus?"

10:46.480 --> 10:48.446
Sounds like a club.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.781
A club for what?

10:49.783 --> 10:52.083
For dancing and
reconciliation.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.686
Say yes.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.024
Okay.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.426
Okay.

11:02.996 --> 11:07.999
Um... Can I pay for this now?
Or are you still texting?

11:16.076 --> 11:19.344
Oh, hi, there. Um...
Have you... Can I...

11:19.346 --> 11:20.445
Are you okay?

11:20.447 --> 11:21.946
I've lost my Zuri.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.748
What is Zuri?

11:23.750 --> 11:25.150
My baby. My dog.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.217
You lose both?

11:26.219 --> 11:27.219
Just my dog.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.921
He's my furry angel.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.256
He's my best friend.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.825
Dog is dog. All the same.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.493
Maybe you find,
maybe you don't.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.228
Just get new one.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.030
I can't replace my Zuri.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.433
- Carol.
- What?

11:41.435 --> 11:44.836
- You pay $500 for that?
- He's worth every penny.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.071
Will you put a poster up?

11:46.073 --> 11:48.773
Don't worry.
I think we find your dog.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.875
- I hope so.
- Oh, I know so.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.383
<i>Yeobo.</i> I'm going out now.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.385
Yeah. No problem.

11:59.753 --> 12:00.985
With Mr. Mehta.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.387
Okay, go.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.659
Ms. Shannon?

12:07.660 --> 12:09.420
Uh... You still have carol?
How is she doing?

12:12.899 --> 12:14.833
I couldn't decide
between salty

12:14.835 --> 12:16.501
And extra salty,
so I brought both.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.221
- Cool.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:19.222 --> 12:20.105
- Where are you going?
- I've got a date.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.239
You're bailing on me?

12:21.241 --> 12:23.241
Not just on you.
On Kimchee, too.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.843
- Later, dude.
- Bye, buddy!

12:28.381 --> 12:30.248
Janet Kim, with the snacks.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.051
Kimchee, with the DVD?

12:33.053 --> 12:34.085
Blu-ray.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.632
Dubbed in three languages
if you want to hear

12:36.656 --> 12:37.656
french jack sparrow.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.858
I'm sensing a hard no.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.159
Don't even
want to watch that movie.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.427
Then why did you
come over to watch it?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.509
I had nothing better to do.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.530
You sure know how to make
a guy feel cool.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.966
That's not what I meant.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.400
Gerald was invited
to this art party,

12:49.402 --> 12:50.935
And I wasn't.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.105
Oh. The old case of the fomos.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.307
Fear of missing out.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.976
Yeah, I got that, blu-ray.

12:57.978 --> 13:01.379
Blu-ray?
I'm gonna rock that nickname.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.414
So what's so special
about this art party?

13:04.351 --> 13:07.018
It's this girl from
school's first solo show.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.253
Lame.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.155
There's free wine
and hors d'oeuvres.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.890
Did you really want
to get all dressed up

13:11.892 --> 13:14.092
So you could look at art
and sip wine and cheese?

13:14.895 --> 13:16.427
You can't sip cheese.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.163
You've obviously
never tried Velveeta.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.149
That's a sippin' cheese.

13:21.150 --> 13:22.545
Wanna not watch the movie
and get dim sum?

13:22.569 --> 13:25.403
Wait here,
I'll get my eating pants on.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.215
Whoa, whoa. Easy.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.550
I'm here to see my son.

13:38.552 --> 13:39.918
That's nice. Back of the line.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.152
His name is Jung.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.887
That's nice.
Back of the line, please.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.351
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.173
- Rose?
- No, thanks.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.542
This is exactly
what I wanted to do tonight.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.910
Liar.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.846
You wanted to mingle
with emo artists.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.181
Ooh, excuse me, ma'am,

14:10.183 --> 14:13.251
Would you say
you are more artsy or fartsy?

14:13.253 --> 14:15.920
Sixty-forty split
in favor of artsy.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.558
But seriously,
I woke up craving dim sum.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.626
Then I guess

14:23.496 --> 14:24.312
It all worked out
on planet Janet.

14:24.313 --> 14:25.341
You haven't called me
that since I was a kid.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.165
When you had
a planet-sized crush on me?

14:27.300 --> 14:28.499
Oh, so we're still on that?

14:29.469 --> 14:31.236
When were we off it?
Maybe I should buy you a rose.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.503
I was 10.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.239
Was it my earring
that did it for you?

14:34.241 --> 14:35.440
Or maybe the axe body spray.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.308
Or the fact that you
let me out of cupboards

14:37.310 --> 14:38.943
That Jung locked me into.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.311
What can I say?

14:40.313 --> 14:41.646
I'm a nice guy.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.282
And that's where your umma
hid the good cookies.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.517
Yeah.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.662
How do I get to second floor?

14:57.664 --> 14:58.963
What?

14:58.965 --> 15:00.298
Second floor!

15:00.433 --> 15:01.433
Oh.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.034
Can you get me up there?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.369
Where?

15:04.371 --> 15:05.371
Second floor.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.038
I don't know.

15:07.874 --> 15:10.508
Would this help me out?

15:10.510 --> 15:12.644
Yeah, okay, it's that way.

15:12.646 --> 15:13.878
Cool. Thanks.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.115
Appa?

15:17.984 --> 15:19.050
Jung.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.960
What took you so long?

15:28.962 --> 15:30.128
Oh, it was so hard

15:30.130 --> 15:31.429
Getting this little girl
out of the house.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.630
I forgot her treats,

15:32.632 --> 15:34.699
Then I realized
I forgot the poo bags,

15:34.701 --> 15:35.967
Then I had a quick cry.

15:35.969 --> 15:38.002
Okay, well, I call you later

15:38.004 --> 15:40.004
And tell you
all about big reunion.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.039
Oh, I can wait.

15:43.376 --> 15:43.958
My cats are fed and
completely traumatized,

15:43.959 --> 15:45.319
So they'll be sleeping
for a while.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.046
Owner is coming later.
Tonight is work night, no?

15:49.149 --> 15:50.581
I guess I do
have an early start.

15:51.017 --> 15:53.151
Maybe it's best to
say goodbye this way.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.285
Less drama.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.720
Yeah, much better.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.155
Zuri!

16:00.226 --> 16:02.293
Where did you find him?

16:02.295 --> 16:04.429
Him? Oh, dear.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.397
Okay, Ms. Shannon.
See you later.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.232
Oh, oh, oh.
I have something for you both.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.568
Gosh, I'm so grateful.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.570
Oh, that is
totally unnecessary.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.172
The reward was spending time

16:14.174 --> 16:15.173
With this little
ball of fluff.

16:15.175 --> 16:19.577
But the work was finding
and calling you for return.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.212
We're just happy
you have your dog back.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.448
Dog owner:
Oh, well, if you're sure.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.083
100% sure.

16:25.251 --> 16:28.519
Okay, great!
All right. Thank you again.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.254
Come on. Come on.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.556
Oh!

16:32.492 --> 16:34.192
So good, right?

16:34.194 --> 16:36.561
Yeah. So good.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.266
Just go over and say hi.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.468
Why would I do that?

16:43.470 --> 16:44.670
Because then
I don't have to be

16:45.772 --> 16:47.238
Sitting across from someone
who is completely distracted.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.639
Sorry. I'll stop looking.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.375
Isn't the art world
about networking?

16:50.377 --> 16:52.477
Yeah, but I'm not big
on small talk.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.779
You just have to ask people
about themselves.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.647
"Hey, how was the show?"

16:56.649 --> 16:59.117
"Where'd you get the dumb hat?
Do you have any siblings?"

16:59.319 --> 17:00.551
I think she's an only child.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.020
Does she know you know that?

17:02.322 --> 17:04.322
- I hope not.
- Just go.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.290
- Yeah?
- You got this.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.362
You see all that
negative perspective.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.765
It's like it's
creeping in on...

17:13.767 --> 17:15.066
Hey, Dree.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.101
Oh, G's friend.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.636
Janet, yeah.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.638
Just wanted to see
how the opening went.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.341
Oh, cool.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.279
So, um, how did it go?

17:28.281 --> 17:30.281
It was pretty sweet.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.251
Great. Well, congrats again.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.452
Thanks! Uh...

17:35.088 --> 17:36.487
Do you and your date
want to join us

17:36.489 --> 17:37.622
For a drink or something?

17:38.158 --> 17:40.324
Oh, no, that's not a date.
At all.

17:40.326 --> 17:41.759
He's just my brother's friend.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.728
Oh, um, is he an artist?

17:44.097 --> 17:45.463
No.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.598
Don't even think
he knows what art is.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.434
Like I say,
he's my brother's roommate.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.202
Kind of single,
wanted shumai...

17:51.838 --> 17:53.337
Cool.

17:54.474 --> 17:58.176
I better, like,
get back to that guy.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.243
Bon appetit.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.184
- Gerald.
- Oh, hey.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.351
I made it after all.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.487
So you're okay with this place
when Dree is here,

18:09.489 --> 18:10.588
But not when I ask.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.123
Kind of two-faced.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.791
I'm probably not
going to eat that much.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.426
I'm out. We're all paid up.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.261
Oh, you didn't
have to pay for me.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.629
Right. Because I'm your
brother's friend.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.164
Kind of single, desperate.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.532
Oh, Kimchee, I...

18:21.534 --> 18:22.533
You know what,
it's totally cool.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.102
I'm just gonna go home
and try to learn what art is.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.303
Well,
it's kind of subjective...

18:25.305 --> 18:26.704
I know. It was a stupid...

18:26.706 --> 18:29.440
Hey, when you take a picture,
do you just press the button,

18:30.443 --> 18:32.483
Or is there like a bunch of
elves inside the camera?

18:34.481 --> 18:36.447
Oh, I guess that was pointed.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.149
I don't even know what art is!

18:40.620 --> 18:42.420
Sure you don't
want to sit with us?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.723
I have to go.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.425
No. I don't...

18:48.228 --> 18:49.293
Oh.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.330
Sorry.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.601
So, nice place.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.436
Uh... Yeah,
but what are you doing...

18:58.438 --> 18:59.638
What can I get you?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.205
Oh, two poktan-ju.

19:01.207 --> 19:02.207
What?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.075
Oh. uh...

19:04.277 --> 19:06.477
Boilermaker. Two please.

19:07.213 --> 19:09.313
- Poktan-ju.
- What?

19:09.315 --> 19:13.284
I just didn't know that it was
something you'd be into.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.320
You tell me
you drink boilermaker.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.722
Yeah. Sometimes.

19:17.724 --> 19:18.789
Okay.

19:25.832 --> 19:30.368
This isn't poktan-ju.
It's good, but not poktan-ju.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.713
So the Jays, huh?
Not the best season.

19:42.715 --> 19:43.748
Yeah.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.717
They can't make playoff
when so many pitcher get hurt.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.554
Yeah. Definitely
a rebuild in the off-season.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.189
Yeah. Definitely.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.527
Excuse me, do you have soju
for a soju bomb?

19:56.529 --> 19:58.462
- Yeah.
- -Can I get two, please?

19:58.464 --> 19:59.797
You got it.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.233
Appa, I got it.

20:02.235 --> 20:05.269
It's okay.
I have lots of money.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.505
$64.50.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.841
Yeah. This is just tip.
My son pay for this.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.543
Thanks.

20:16.516 --> 20:17.682
Uh...

20:18.484 --> 20:19.550
<i>Geonbae.</i>

20:20.553 --> 20:21.619
<i>Geonbae.</i>

20:27.360 --> 20:28.492
Hey.

20:28.494 --> 20:29.594
If you're here
for your snacks,

20:29.596 --> 20:30.828
I already ate them all.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.663
How? You were
one streetcar ahead of me.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.466
Now you're going to criticize
how quickly I eat snacks?

20:35.468 --> 20:39.003
No, I just...
I was a huge jerk tonight.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.005
Agreed.

20:41.307 --> 20:42.640
I'm sorry.

20:43.376 --> 20:46.010
Will you accept
this buddy rose?

20:46.779 --> 20:48.479
So you're asking me
to be your friend?

20:48.481 --> 20:53.050
Yeah, kind of a new phase
for planet Janet and blu-ray.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.286
Sure.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.055
There's bugs in it.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.857
It was the best one he had.

20:59.859 --> 21:00.925
Yo.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.361
Tell me you at least
got her lipstick color.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.595
I don't want to know
what that means.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.696
You going to see her again?

21:06.666 --> 21:09.367
Yeah. I think I will.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.636
All right,
<i>Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

21:11.638 --> 21:13.804
Director's cut,
with commentary,

21:13.806 --> 21:14.905
And alternate endings.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.147
Didn't you just
watch the movie?

21:16.409 --> 21:18.376
- I wish.
- I'm in.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.644
Sorry, I'm not
that good of a friend.

21:19.646 --> 21:20.646
Have fun.
