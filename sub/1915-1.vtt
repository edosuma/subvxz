02:11.173 --> 02:13.091
Yes, of course.

02:13.175 --> 02:16.261
As you know, our blockade
is perfectly legal,

I have a bad feeling
about this.

- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

03:10.649 --> 03:14.569
It's something...
elsewhere, elusive.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.072
Don't center on
your anxieties, Obi-Wan.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.325
Keep your concentration
here and now, where it belongs.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.286
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.414
But not at the expense
of the moment.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.502
Yes, Master.

How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

03:36.466 --> 03:38.593
These Federation types
are cowards.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.555
The negotiations
will be short.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.975

What did you say?

03:45.058 --> 03:48.061
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.877
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

04:12.002 --> 04:16.548
No. I sense an unusual amount of fear
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.394
What is it?

04:29.519 --> 04:32.189
This scheme of yours
has failed, Lord Sidious.

We dare not go against these Jedi.

this stunted slime in my sight again.

And the Jedi?

04:57.672 --> 05:02.093

them into this. Kill them immediately.

- It's an invasion army.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.460
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.713
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

07:43.797 --> 07:48.718
Let's split up. Stow aboard separate
ships and meet down on the planet.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.721
You were right
about one thing, Master.

07:51.805 --> 07:55.350
The negotiations
were short.

07:55.517 --> 07:58.895
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

08:11.324 --> 08:15.078
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.747
I was not aware
of such failure.

I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

to reach settlement.

of any ambassadors.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.299
You must be mistaken.

Beware, Viceroy.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.221
The Federation
has gone too far this time.

08:33.346 --> 08:37.392
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.019
You assume too much.

- It's too late now.

- I don't know.

08:50.363 --> 08:54.701
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

08:59.581 --> 09:04.002

because the ambassadors aren't there?

09:04.085 --> 09:06.254
How could that be true?

09:06.379 --> 09:10.717

09:19.476 --> 09:21.352

09:21.478 --> 09:26.357
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.777
The Federation would not
dare go that far.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.697
The senate would revoke their
trade franchise, and they'd be finished.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.700
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.037

We've lost all communications.

that will lead us to war.

of the Jedi.

They will have no choice but to accept
your control of the system.

The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

will not be difficult.

How will you explain
this invasion to the senate?

21:38.380 --> 21:42.593
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.846
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

21:45.971 --> 21:49.433
- I will not cooperate. - Now, now, Your Highness.

our point of view.

We're ambassadors

Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.225
The negotiations
never took place.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.728
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

- They've knocked out
all our communications.
- Do you have transports?

- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

23:29.533 --> 23:33.120
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.332
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.126
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

23:39.251 --> 23:43.005
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.
They can't afford to kill her.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.215
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.301
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.386
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.889
Our only hope is for
the senate to side with us.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.475
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

23:54.558 --> 23:58.562
Either choice presents
great danger... to us all.

We are brave,

If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

24:06.612 --> 24:09.365
Be careful, Governor.

We'll need to free
those pilots.

to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

to refuel and repair the ship.

by the Hutts.

by the Federation,

for her, which gives us the advantage.

has she signed the treaty?

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:09.276
in the common good.

01:23:09.359 --> 01:23:11.612
I must be frank,
Your Majesty.

01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:14.615
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

01:23:14.698 --> 01:23:17.618
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:21.788
If I may say so, Your Majesty,
the chancellor has little real power.

01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:25.792
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:29.630
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:33.300
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

01:23:33.425 --> 01:23:35.302
of a stronger
supreme chancellor,

01:23:35.427 --> 01:23:37.930
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:39.890
and give us justice.

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:44.269
You could call for
a vote of no confidence...

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:46.271
in Chancellor Valorum.

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:48.899
He has been
our strongest supporter.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:54.238
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:57.658
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

01:23:57.783 --> 01:24:00.661
Our people are dying,
Senator.

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:04.498
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:07.251
To be realistic,
Your Majesty,

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:12.339
I think we're going to have to accept
Federation control for the time being.

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:16.176
That is something
I cannot do.

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:26.144
He was trained
in the Jedi arts.

01:24:26.228 --> 01:24:30.190
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:34.486
Impossible. The Sith have been
extinct for a millennium.

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:38.782
I do not believe the Sith
could have returned without us knowing.

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:41.994
Ah, hard to see,
the dark side is.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:44.997
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.125
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.127
May the Force
be with you.

01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:55.632
[ Yoda ]
Master Qui-Gon.

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:58.135
More to say have you?

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:02.306
With your permission,
my master,

01:25:03.807 --> 01:25:06.852
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:09.980
A vergence, you say?

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:12.232
Located around a person?

01:25:12.316 --> 01:25:14.234
A boy.

01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:18.155
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians
I have seen in a life-form.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.158
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:25.203
You refer
to the prophecy...

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:27.706
of the one who will bring
balance to the Force.

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:29.666
You believe
it's this boy?

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:32.377
- I don't presume to--
-[Yoda]But you do.

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:35.088
Revealed your opinion is.

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:37.215
I request the boy
be tested, Master.

01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:42.596
Oh? Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:45.432
Finding him
was the will of the Force.

01:25:45.557 --> 01:25:47.434
I have no doubt of that.

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:53.565
[ Sighs ]

01:25:53.648 --> 01:25:56.193
Bring him before us, then.

01:26:06.286 --> 01:26:09.164
- [ Beeps ]
- The boy's here to see Padme.

01:26:09.289 --> 01:26:11.166
[ Woman ]
Let him in.

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:17.964
I'm sorry, Ani,
but Padme's not here right now.

01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:20.425
Who is it?

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:23.553
Anakin Skywalker to see Padme,
Your Highness.

01:26:23.678 --> 01:26:25.555
I've sent Padme
on an errand.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:30.560
I'm on my way to the Jedi temple
to start my training, I hope.

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:34.481
I may never see her again,
so I came to say good-bye.

01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:36.483
We will tell her for you.

01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:39.236
We are sure
her heart goes with you.

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:41.405
Thank you, Your Highness.

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:59.506

from the sovereign system of Naboo.

[ Senators Murmuring ]

01:27:06.263 --> 01:27:10.684
[ Palpatine ] Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate,

01:27:10.767 --> 01:27:13.186
a tragedy has occurred...

01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:16.815
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:19.943
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:22.028
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:24.364
This is outrageous!

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:27.033
I object to
the senator's statements.

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:31.204
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:35.208
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala,

01:27:35.333 --> 01:27:37.335
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo,

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:39.337
who speaks
on our behalf.

01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:41.339
[ Murmuring Continues ]

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:48.054
Honorable representatives
of the Republic,

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:51.308
I come to you under
the gravest of circumstances.

01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:54.394
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade--

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:57.981
I object!
There is no proof!.

01:27:58.106 --> 01:27:59.983
This is incredible.

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:04.154
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:06.490
The Congress of Malastare concurs...

01:28:06.615 --> 01:28:09.409
with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

01:28:09.493 --> 01:28:11.912
- A commission must be appointed.
- The point--

01:28:11.995 --> 01:28:15.165
- Excuse me, Chancellor.
-[Palpatine]Enter the bureaucrat.

The true rulers
of the Republic.

01:28:18.043 --> 01:28:22.214
And on the payroll of
the Trade Federation, I might add.

01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:26.551
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:30.430
[Valorum]
The point is conceded.

01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:33.433
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:36.061
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

01:28:36.186 --> 01:28:38.104
I will not defer.

01:28:38.188 --> 01:28:41.733
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:44.861
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

in a committee.

If this body
is not capable of action,

is needed.

test, Master. He's too old.

I understand your concern,

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:37.093
I've decided
to go back to Naboo.

01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:39.179
Go back?
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.

01:32:39.262 --> 01:32:41.181
They'll force you
to sign the treaty.

01:32:41.264 --> 01:32:43.683
I will sign no treaty,
Senator.

01:32:43.767 --> 01:32:46.311
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

Please, Your Majesty,

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:57.363
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

01:32:57.489 --> 01:33:01.826
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

01:33:12.003 --> 01:33:14.589

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:21.137
No, he will not
be trained.

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:22.889
No?

01:33:24.933 --> 01:33:27.018
He is too old.

01:33:27.101 --> 01:33:30.897
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:35.652
Mmm. Clouded
this boy's future is.

01:33:37.862 --> 01:33:39.697
I will train him, then.

01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:46.871

as my Padawan learner.

01:33:50.041 --> 01:33:52.418
Impossible
to take on a second.

The code forbids it.

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:57.715
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

01:33:57.799 --> 01:34:01.427
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

01:34:01.553 --> 01:34:03.429
He is headstrong,

01:34:03.555 --> 01:34:06.933
and he has much to learn of
the living Force, but he is capable.

01:34:07.016 --> 01:34:10.270
There is little more
he can learn from me.

01:34:11.646 --> 01:34:13.523
Young Skywalker's fate...

01:34:13.648 --> 01:34:15.441
will be decided later.

01:34:15.567 --> 01:34:18.111
Now is not the time
for this.

01:34:18.236 --> 01:34:20.905
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor,

01:34:20.989 --> 01:34:23.700
and Queen Amidala
is returning home,

01:34:23.825 --> 01:34:27.036
which will put pressure
on the Federation and could
widen the confrontation.

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:29.455
And draw out
the queen's attacker.

01:34:29.539 --> 01:34:33.960
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

01:34:35.211 --> 01:34:37.130
This is the clue we need...

01:34:37.213 --> 01:34:39.465
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:42.427
May the Force
be with you.

01:34:55.607 --> 01:34:58.484
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:00.486
From your point of view.

01:35:00.612 --> 01:35:03.990
