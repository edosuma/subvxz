Wow, it's a small boat.

02:58.093 --> 02:59.846
What's he doing here?

03:00.930 --> 03:02.137
Cosmo.

03:02.139 --> 03:02.971
Cosmo.

03:02.973 --> 03:04.806
Look here, Cosmo.

03:04.808 --> 03:06.851
May I join you for a boat ride?

03:06.853 --> 03:07.768
Pretty please?

03:07.770 --> 03:09.477
Yeah, yeah.

03:09.479 --> 03:10.606
Okay, yeah.

03:14.068 --> 03:14.902
Huh?

03:15.944 --> 03:18.613
Well, I guess I'll
just sit there.

03:20.949 --> 03:22.324
Hmmph, it's my boat.

03:22.326 --> 03:23.576
Goin' to sleep.

03:23.578 --> 03:24.493
Oh, Cosmo.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.661
I really want to
take a boat ride.

03:26.663 --> 03:28.121
Hey, hey.

03:28.123 --> 03:29.290
Please.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.292
Oh, you.

03:32.294 --> 03:33.168
You're annoying.

03:33.170 --> 03:34.377
You really want a boat?

03:34.379 --> 03:35.963
Why don't you go and
make your own?

03:35.965 --> 03:36.881
Hmmph.

03:36.883 --> 03:37.840
Fine then.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.550
I won't share my nectar
with you ever again.

03:55.693 --> 03:56.694
What a life.

03:59.822 --> 04:02.656
Huh? Oh man, what is
that noise there?

04:02.658 --> 04:04.282
Huh?

04:12.710 --> 04:15.710
I finally found a curved
leaf big enough to be my boat.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.179
That ain't even a boat.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.391
Say what?

04:27.266 --> 04:30.269
Cosmo, you know
nothing about boats.

04:31.853 --> 04:34.690
Anyway, I think my
boat is lovely.

04:49.538 --> 04:51.579
What's wrong?

04:51.581 --> 04:53.039
A little sea sick there?

04:53.041 --> 04:56.334
Cosmo, please stop
shaking my boat.

04:56.336 --> 04:58.714
Why should I listen to you?

05:00.216 --> 05:02.466
I'll shake it if I want to.

05:06.805 --> 05:08.848
Get your hands off my boat.

05:08.850 --> 05:09.684
Cosmo.

05:11.894 --> 05:12.728
Let go.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.353
Cosmo please.

05:15.355 --> 05:17.358
So. You're not letting go?

05:22.237 --> 05:25.197
That should teach
ya to mess with me.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.367
Stop it you.

05:28.452 --> 05:30.577
Get away from me, get away.

05:30.579 --> 05:32.913
You can't do anything
now, you silly butterfly.

05:32.915 --> 05:34.414
You'll be sorry.

05:34.416 --> 05:36.249
Take this.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.586
I'm not afraid of you.

05:41.132 --> 05:41.966
Let go.

05:44.052 --> 05:44.886
Stop it.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.262
It's mine.

05:48.264 --> 05:49.098
Let go.

05:53.435 --> 05:55.310
Why you, pesky bug.

05:55.312 --> 05:56.812
Give that back to me.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.399
You can dream on.

06:01.276 --> 06:02.277
Butterfly.

06:33.475 --> 06:36.687
Huh, no one takes
from Cosmo, no one.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.649
Now you're just asking for it.

06:45.697 --> 06:46.945
You.

06:46.947 --> 06:49.156
You had it coming Cosmo.

06:49.158 --> 06:50.158
Butterfly.

06:58.166 --> 06:59.001
Butterfly?

07:03.923 --> 07:05.923
Pretty good shot, huh?

07:09.177 --> 07:12.014
I'll make sure you
can't run away.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.230
I've got it.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.402
Ha ha, now you've got
nowhere to run.

07:27.404 --> 07:29.279
Maybe I don't need to.

07:29.281 --> 07:30.115
Take this.

07:35.370 --> 07:38.163
You want your slimy picks in?

07:52.012 --> 07:52.846
I got ya.

07:54.598 --> 07:55.432
My boat.

08:01.396 --> 08:03.774
I'm the best, I'm the best.

08:23.127 --> 08:26.211
Butterfly, I'm really
really sorry.

08:26.213 --> 08:29.798
I will forgive you,
but only if you build me

08:29.800 --> 08:31.216
a new boat.

08:31.218 --> 08:32.260
Yeah, sure.

08:34.554 --> 08:35.931
Let's get rowing.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.330
It always feels like I can
never get enough sleep in.

09:14.678 --> 09:15.846
My head hurts.

09:17.472 --> 09:20.142
I need something to cheer me up.

09:29.985 --> 09:30.819
A monster.

09:35.158 --> 09:38.658
Yeah, it's just an
ugly duckling.

09:38.660 --> 09:45.291
I wonder what it's
doing around here?

09:45.293 --> 09:46.501
Hey, whatcha doing?

09:46.836 --> 09:48.835
You can't just float around
Joe Croaker's domain, ya hear?

09:48.837 --> 09:51.421
Now get out of here now.

09:51.423 --> 09:52.964
I don't want trouble.

09:52.966 --> 09:55.133
Hey I told you ducky.

09:55.135 --> 10:02.184
You just get out of here!

10:07.440 --> 10:08.608
That'll do it.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.316
Mess with me.

10:12.736 --> 10:14.072
You'll be sorry.

10:14.947 --> 10:15.781
Yeah.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.553
Yah.

10:40.889 --> 10:42.891
You, what are you doing?

10:46.729 --> 10:48.605
Hey, you say something.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.088
I'll show you, you ugly
duckling.

11:17.092 --> 11:20.344
Your stubby little wings are
no match for Joe Croaker.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.432
Wee-ya, prepare yourself.

11:26.644 --> 11:30.896
Well then little ducky, I
see that you're quite fond

11:30.898 --> 11:33.107
of Joe Croaker's little marsh.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.941
Now then, there
isn't room enough

11:34.943 --> 11:38.653
for both you and I so I
challenge ya to a duel.

11:38.655 --> 11:39.656
Let's do it.

11:41.366 --> 11:43.658
Ooh, you're a tough guy.

11:43.660 --> 11:47.329
Waiting for it, the opportunity
to attack.

11:47.331 --> 11:49.290
Aren't you rubber ducky?

11:49.292 --> 11:51.836
Bring it, I'm a kung fu master.

11:53.296 --> 11:56.254
Can't keep up with
my fancy moves, huh?

11:56.256 --> 11:57.506
Oh yeah.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.257
Okay big boy.

11:59.259 --> 12:01.969
You don't stand a chance.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.679
Now let's play.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.104
Now you're done for.

12:13.106 --> 12:14.942
I will crush you down.

12:22.115 --> 12:24.241
I'll put you down.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.745
Against the ropes.

12:32.626 --> 12:33.669
Don't mess with this frog,
you got that?

12:36.172 --> 12:37.421
Take this and this.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.174
Don't you forget
it, little ducky.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.050
Take this and this and this too.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.219
Stop Joe Croaker.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.470
You leave him alone, okay?

12:45.472 --> 12:47.098
Stay out of it.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.766
No, you leave him alone.

12:48.768 --> 12:52.103
Listen little duckling,
get out of here.

12:52.105 --> 12:57.192
Pardon me, this is
between me and the duckling.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.484
I won't let you
bully the weak, Joe.

12:59.486 --> 13:00.612
You asked for it.

13:02.532 --> 13:06.536
Hear this, I'm gonna catch
ya, then I'll smash ya.

13:08.453 --> 13:11.747
Don't worry buddy,
I'll protect you.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.373
Listen up, I'm glad

13:13.375 --> 13:16.086

13:19.881 --> 13:21.757
I'll get you.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.387
I'm coming to you.

13:27.389 --> 13:30.181
Joe Croaker, you get
off of me.

13:30.183 --> 13:31.309
I'm gonna squash ya.

13:40.068 --> 13:42.237
Ah, little duckling run.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.575
Now where are ya?

13:47.576 --> 13:48.993

13:56.919 --> 13:58.921
Come out and show
yourself you silly bee.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.004
Where is he?

14:01.006 --> 14:01.840
This way.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.059
What's the matter with you?

14:13.061 --> 14:14.310
You couldn't even
shake a tail feather.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.355
Don't just nod, talk to me.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.108
You're hopeless.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.153
Don't worry.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.323
It looks like Joe is gone.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.034
Let's get out of here.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.374
Looking for me?

14:37.835 --> 14:39.334
Going nowhere.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.172
Come on buddy, move.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.131
Move it.

14:46.469 --> 14:47.676
I've really got ya
now, big guy.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.136
Come on.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.137
What to do?

14:50.139 --> 14:51.597
Let's go.

14:51.599 --> 14:54.307
Pull on him more, you got it.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.522
That was sore.

15:00.524 --> 15:03.441
Hey ya, it serves you right.

15:03.443 --> 15:05.529
Now you, you're mine.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.991
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.035
Let him go.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.724
What is this thing?

15:35.726 --> 15:36.894
Joe Croaker.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.608
Tell me, what have you
done with ducky?

15:43.610 --> 15:46.569
How should I know,
how should I know what

15:46.571 --> 15:47.862
happened to the duckling?

15:47.864 --> 15:49.195
Are you kidding me?

15:49.197 --> 15:52.032
Tell me what you've done or
you're in trouble, got it?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.702
You're blaming me?

15:55.580 --> 15:57.579
Hey Joe.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.375
Let that duckling go.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.545
Unhand him Joe Croaker.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.846
There's nothing better
than lazing around.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.140
Oh yeah.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.405
What's that, I'd better
go check it out.

16:37.245 --> 16:38.454
What is that thing?

16:38.456 --> 16:39.289
Ahh.

16:45.587 --> 16:49.422
A mutant, a horrible mutant
monster.

16:49.424 --> 16:50.968
This is creepy, I'm outta here.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.906
Stop right there, don't
come any closer.

17:16.411 --> 17:17.828
Please, so scary.

17:40.143 --> 17:40.977
Whoa.

17:49.902 --> 17:50.737
Scary.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.531
This is so weird.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.285
No response.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.623
Now I wonder, could this
be a prank?

18:10.088 --> 18:11.590
I'm gonna get you.

18:12.967 --> 18:13.801
Oh wee.

18:19.891 --> 18:20.725
Hey.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.688
Finally got ya big guy.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.195
My head hurts.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.948
You big blue monster.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.873
You monster.

18:56.551 --> 18:59.719
Oh no, my sweet, sweet honey.

18:59.721 --> 19:00.847
Who did this?

19:04.227 --> 19:05.101
Who hit my honey jar
with a stone?

19:05.103 --> 19:06.854
You'd better show yourself.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.065
Just show yourself already.

19:10.732 --> 19:11.731
Joe Croaker?

19:11.733 --> 19:13.734
Hey Joe, have you seen
anyone throwing stones

19:13.736 --> 19:14.986
around here?

19:14.988 --> 19:17.738
No, maybe you should
try over there.

19:17.740 --> 19:18.615
Oh, thank you.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.456
Stop smiling at me.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.628
What are you laughing at?

19:32.630 --> 19:33.921
Yah.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.008
It was him.

19:36.884 --> 19:37.884
Joe Croaker.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.933
You deserved that.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.769
Now I'm really mad.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.105
Why is that rope
attached to his belly

19:52.107 --> 19:52.983
and the grass?

19:57.654 --> 19:58.947
I have an idea.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.166
This is tough rope.

20:12.252 --> 20:15.255
Oh yeah, I'll just pull
out the grass.

20:23.306 --> 20:24.140
Okay.

20:29.938 --> 20:32.273
You try to escape, are we?

20:35.401 --> 20:37.403
I've got you now smiley face.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.866
What's going on?

20:45.327 --> 20:46.869
It's so high.

20:46.871 --> 20:49.540
Somebody help me, somebody help.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.672
Joe Croaker, oh my.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.549
I can't stop, please help.

21:01.844 --> 21:04.010
Hey Joe, look out ahead.

21:04.012 --> 21:05.222
What's ahead?

21:06.348 --> 21:07.266
Oh my word.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.027
What's going on?

21:20.570 --> 21:21.405
Help me.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.157
Hey Joe, are you okay?

21:25.159 --> 21:26.700
No Bartle Bee,
help me get down.

21:26.702 --> 21:27.910
Listen Joe,
don't cry, it's okay.

21:27.912 --> 21:30.537
I'll go get some
help right away.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.207
Help, don't leave me alone.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.381
I can't wait anymore.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.262
Cosmo, Joe's right over there.

21:49.683 --> 21:52.559
I hate you smiley face,
you scare me.

21:52.561 --> 21:53.478
Let's go.

21:56.316 --> 21:59.485
Isn't that just a
balloon dinosaur?

22:03.030 --> 22:06.075
Hey Joe Croaker,
leave that balloon alone.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.161
Oh a balloon,
I don't care what it is.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.079
I'm gonna get him.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.792
Hey there Joe, watch out.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.048
Help me.

22:22.549 --> 22:23.467
Help, help.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.929
Don't worry Joe,
we'll help ya.

22:27.931 --> 22:29.015
Help, help.

22:32.268 --> 22:34.062
I'm scared.

22:35.229 --> 22:39.190
Stop bumping against
it you two up there.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.526
I'm exhausted.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.990
Would you
please help me out?

22:47.075 --> 22:49.574
Bartle Bee, hurry,
let's remove this cork

22:49.576 --> 22:50.534
from the balloon.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.870
Then Joe will float right back
down.

22:52.872 --> 22:53.706
Hurry.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.633
Try harder.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.645
Bye, bye, bye.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.989
So nice.

23:28.991 --> 23:31.786
This is going to be
my lunch today.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.081
Now then, I'll need a drink.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.211
Oh boy, look
at this mini buffet.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.256
Nobody's around, I guess
it's all mine then.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.634
Wahoo, I hit the jackpot today.

23:54.726 --> 23:56.726
Get back here you thief.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.062
I'm sorry Joe.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.607
I didn't know.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.573
That must have hurt.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.159
Come and get me.

24:13.161 --> 24:14.287
Oh yeah, you can't fly.

24:16.788 --> 24:19.873
Just look at you, a loser
without wings.

24:19.875 --> 24:20.999
You'll never catch up with me

24:21.001 --> 24:22.419
you stinking amphibian.

24:23.253 --> 24:24.253
What?

24:24.255 --> 24:25.757
You'll be sorry when I get ya.

24:27.258 --> 24:28.882
Pathetic, I'm gonna
hang out with someone

24:28.884 --> 24:31.009
who can actually fly.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.013
You fly, I'll get you.

24:39.269 --> 24:40.395
What is this?

24:44.232 --> 24:45.067
Oh.

24:48.488 --> 24:51.404
That's it, I'll catch that
stinky fly.

24:51.406 --> 24:54.240
I'm gonna soar through the sky.

25:37.452 --> 25:38.745
It's done, yeah.

25:51.134 --> 25:51.968
Oh.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.636
Worked like magic.

26:09.777 --> 26:11.651
I'm gonna be the first
frog in the sky.

26:11.653 --> 26:15.115
I'm a genius froggy.
Oh yeah yeah.

26:18.327 --> 26:20.538
Wait, hold on.

26:26.169 --> 26:28.755
I'm flying, I'm flying.

26:30.339 --> 26:33.757
Goodbye ground and
hello to the sky.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.886
I can see my house from up here.

26:39.390 --> 26:41.893
Wow, it smells unbelievable.

26:53.613 --> 26:55.323
What's that thing there?

26:56.156 --> 26:58.116
Hey, Cosmo I'm flying.

26:59.410 --> 27:00.954
There ain't nothing I can't do.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.375
Lovely, delicious this is.

27:10.546 --> 27:13.298
I have to admit,
you've got guts Cosmo.

27:14.634 --> 27:15.468
Now then.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.310
You can't get away from me.

27:26.561 --> 27:27.769
I'm coming to get ya.

27:27.771 --> 27:28.938
I'm sorry Joe.

27:28.940 --> 27:30.730
Here I come.

27:30.732 --> 27:32.107
Full speed ahead.

27:32.109 --> 27:33.694
Hey, just give up already.

27:34.695 --> 27:35.529
Hey Cosmo.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.157
I'll get ya.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.452
I've been going easy on you.

27:44.454 --> 27:47.163
Now it's time to finish
this once and for all.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.748
Come back here.

27:48.750 --> 27:49.586
You heard me fly.

27:52.797 --> 27:55.799
Come on Joe,
show me what you got.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.217
I'll show ya.

27:58.219 --> 27:59.053
Take this.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.101
You'll never catch me.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.187
I'll catch you.

28:13.276 --> 28:14.736
You stinking fly, hey.

28:15.944 --> 28:16.778
Come on.

28:20.991 --> 28:21.826
Darn it.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.204
How do I catch him?

28:27.457 --> 28:29.500
I'm not fast enough.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.463
I gotta think of something.

28:35.673 --> 28:38.798
Stinking frog must
have thrown in the towel.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.968
Oh, oh my heart.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.969
The pain, the pain.

28:42.971 --> 28:44.807
It hurts so bad,
the pain, the pain.

28:46.308 --> 28:48.769
What's his deal?

28:51.689 --> 28:52.523
What the?

28:54.232 --> 28:55.067
Joe?

29:00.530 --> 29:03.407
Come on Joe, you gotta quit
acting a fool.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.203
Can't trick me just
by laying there.

29:07.038 --> 29:07.870
What if he ain't acting?

29:07.872 --> 29:08.996
Joe, Joe?

29:08.998 --> 29:11.334
Joe, this ain't funny,
I'm leaving.

29:12.585 --> 29:15.004
Do you really think he could
bamboozle me?

29:17.006 --> 29:18.881
He's still lying there.

29:18.883 --> 29:20.343
Maybe I should check on him.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.014
Yeah, oh Joe.

29:26.766 --> 29:27.597
Joe, wake up.

29:27.599 --> 29:31.059
Come on Joe, Joe, come on.

29:31.061 --> 29:32.561
Wake up.

29:32.563 --> 29:36.442
Oh Joe, Joe stop playing, come
on buddy.

29:37.317 --> 29:38.528
Snap out of it.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.531
What are you doing?

29:45.242 --> 29:47.242
You're not going nowhere.

29:47.244 --> 29:49.579
Joe, you sunk too low,
put me down.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.123
What do you want?

29:52.125 --> 29:52.959
Let go of me.

29:57.422 --> 29:58.754
How do you like that Cosmo.

29:58.756 --> 30:02.091
If you mess with me
you're gonna get flicked.

30:06.513 --> 30:07.514
Why are we stopping?

30:08.724 --> 30:10.976
Oh no, we are so going down.

30:26.075 --> 30:27.533
That wasn't cool.

30:27.535 --> 30:28.745
Where's Cosmo?

30:29.912 --> 30:30.747
Stinking fly.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.915
I'm right here Joe Croaker.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.667
I'm gonna get you fly.

30:36.669 --> 30:38.922
Yeah,
we'll see about that.

30:45.929 --> 30:47.721
Temperature today
is just perfect.

30:48.932 --> 30:51.097
The air is so refreshing

30:51.099 --> 30:54.144
and now another
beautiful day begins.

30:58.732 --> 31:01.485
My name is Joe and
I'm king of the pond.

31:09.868 --> 31:10.702
Candy.

31:12.997 --> 31:13.996
This is just great.

31:13.998 --> 31:14.874
Come here.

31:25.759 --> 31:27.259
My arms are too short.

31:27.261 --> 31:29.888
Okay, I'm gonna bring out the
old muscles.

31:45.363 --> 31:46.197
Got ya.

31:55.080 --> 31:55.998
Oh my head.

32:01.128 --> 32:01.962
Oh, scary face.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.380
What is that thing?

32:04.382 --> 32:05.216
Scary.

32:06.634 --> 32:07.468
Who is that guy?

32:09.136 --> 32:12.138
Hey you, you can't just stand
there

32:12.140 --> 32:13.807
staring at me like that.

32:23.067 --> 32:24.190
Who do you think you are?

32:24.192 --> 32:26.613
No one messes with the
number one frog in the marsh.

32:28.948 --> 32:32.493
Apologize right now, to my face.

32:36.998 --> 32:39.457
Well clearly you're not familiar

32:39.459 --> 32:41.459
with who I really am are ya?

32:41.461 --> 32:44.629
Now listen up buddy, I am
king of all that you see,

32:44.631 --> 32:45.546
Joe Croaker.

32:45.548 --> 32:47.882
Check it, my arms are like
really strong

32:47.884 --> 32:52.889
and these hind legs are
able to jump really high.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.724
So now you...

32:58.227 --> 32:59.519
Now intimidated yet?

33:00.813 --> 33:03.689
Hey you, wipe that smile off.

33:03.691 --> 33:05.565
You're supposed to
bow down to me.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.526
Worship my amphibian beauty.

33:07.528 --> 33:09.069
Now wipe that grin off your face

33:09.071 --> 33:11.238
or I'm gonna have
to wipe it off for ya.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.616
Do you hear me, do ya?

33:22.835 --> 33:23.793
Now I'm fuming mister.

33:23.795 --> 33:25.880
You have no idea how
intolerant I really am.

33:26.964 --> 33:28.131
You still mock me.

33:29.259 --> 33:30.801
I'm gonna mock you.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.762
Now are you
feeling really dizzy?

33:37.432 --> 33:42.438
Stop laughing.

33:44.941 --> 33:46.315
Huh?

33:49.903 --> 33:50.738
Ouchie.

33:58.288 --> 33:59.622
Surprise attack.

34:03.459 --> 34:04.419
Where is he?

34:14.012 --> 34:15.135
No fair.

34:15.137 --> 34:16.346
I wasn't ready for that.

34:17.306 --> 34:20.974
But now I know all your moves.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.353
You don't stand a chance
against me mister.

34:25.398 --> 34:26.231
I'll defeat ya.

34:28.735 --> 34:29.568
En guard.

34:30.777 --> 34:31.985
I'm pretty talented with
the old stick,

34:31.987 --> 34:32.821
aren't I mister?

34:38.827 --> 34:43.166
You won't be able to fight
back when you're all tied up.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.545
You should call it a day buddy.

34:49.547 --> 34:50.547
Yeah, I win.

34:52.967 --> 34:55.592
I made it,
I made it.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.971
I wonder what he's doing.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.356
That's great.

35:09.358 --> 35:11.568
McBroom, hey McBroom.

35:13.320 --> 35:16.988
Hey, say there,
you seem excitable.

35:16.990 --> 35:19.201
Are you feeling
the thrill of victory?

35:20.161 --> 35:21.702
Did you beat an enemy?

35:21.704 --> 35:23.454
No Joe Croaker.

35:23.456 --> 35:25.373
I do not have
any enemies around.

35:25.375 --> 35:29.084
Actually I'm busy making
a dung ball mountain.

35:29.086 --> 35:31.795
I spent the entire day
on this bony pyramid

35:31.797 --> 35:33.590
of my special dung balls.

35:34.550 --> 35:37.008
Look, it's beautiful.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.846
If you say so.

35:39.889 --> 35:40.845
You're a worry.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.807
You and your poop McBroom.

35:42.809 --> 35:44.266
Back to me.

35:44.268 --> 35:46.601
I just defeated the most
gruesome villain

35:46.603 --> 35:48.271
I've ever seen.

35:48.273 --> 35:50.066
Where is he now then?

35:51.150 --> 35:52.775
He's right over there.

35:52.777 --> 35:54.735
I've got him all tied up.

35:54.737 --> 35:56.195
Mighty Joe Croaker.

35:56.197 --> 35:58.363
I do not see anyone.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.115
You're all talk Joe.

36:00.117 --> 36:00.951
Say what?

36:04.746 --> 36:07.081
Joe, it's a monster coming
this way.

36:15.465 --> 36:16.884
My dung ball pyramid.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.885
Why you?

36:19.887 --> 36:21.055
Don't, stop.

36:23.056 --> 36:24.391
Why I'm gonna.

36:26.768 --> 36:28.226
I think not.

36:28.228 --> 36:29.605
I cannot knock him down.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.108
You can't?

36:51.628 --> 36:52.459
Got it.

36:52.461 --> 36:54.961
McBroom, you're an inspiration.

36:58.342 --> 37:00.177
Come on, you can help.

37:02.472 --> 37:05.472
Hey, hey Joe Croaker, you
really think

37:05.474 --> 37:07.182
that this will work?

37:07.184 --> 37:08.099
Totally.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.309
If he's not able to stand up
straight,

37:09.311 --> 37:11.605
he'll no longer be a
problem for me or anyone.

37:12.481 --> 37:16.150
Now then, on the count of three.

37:16.152 --> 37:19.197
One, two, three.

37:29.206 --> 37:30.164
Did ya see that?

37:30.166 --> 37:32.583
Did ya see the look that was on
his face?

37:32.585 --> 37:37.170
Smiley, not grinning so much
now are ya?

37:38.757 --> 37:41.425
Now he knows who's the
boss and that would be me,

37:41.427 --> 37:42.550
isn't that right?

37:42.552 --> 37:45.845
Hi there, let's have a
celebratory meal.

37:45.847 --> 37:48.307
Thank you, but I'll
think I'll be all right.

37:48.309 --> 37:49.684
You sure?

37:49.686 --> 37:51.476
I'm gonna make another
dung ball pyramid.

37:51.478 --> 37:53.061
A much bigger one
this time around.

37:53.063 --> 37:54.273
I could use your help.

37:55.817 --> 37:57.485
I think I'll pass.

38:43.322 --> 38:44.949
Oh boy.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.668
I wish I had an extra pair
of hands to help me out.

39:08.764 --> 39:13.934
McBroom?

39:13.936 --> 39:15.936
McBroom, what's going on?

39:15.938 --> 39:17.354
Hi Bartle Bee.

39:17.356 --> 39:20.106
It's nothing, it's just
that I'm getting swamped

39:20.108 --> 39:23.653
with these dung balls
and I cannot do it alone.

39:23.655 --> 39:24.781
I see.

39:25.782 --> 39:28.660
Ah, McBroom, why don't
you hire someone to help?

39:30.411 --> 39:31.244
Hire?

39:36.251 --> 39:38.041
Okay guys attention.

39:38.043 --> 39:41.211
Hey, McBroom's looking for
an assistant to help him.

39:41.213 --> 39:43.463
Anyone interested in
the dung ball business?

39:43.465 --> 39:44.717
You know you want to.

39:45.717 --> 39:48.010
Sounds so cool, I'm in.

39:48.012 --> 39:50.720
Oh wow, and the best part
is I'd always be around

39:50.722 --> 39:52.639
the dung balls.

39:56.396 --> 39:57.936
Ew, I'll pass.

39:57.938 --> 39:59.231
It's not a job for a lady.

40:00.148 --> 40:02.316
Okay, those of you who
would like to apply for

40:02.318 --> 40:03.778
the job, smile.

40:05.989 --> 40:07.030
Where'd everybody go?

40:11.159 --> 40:13.619
All right, I'm sure Bartle
Bee has already told you

40:13.621 --> 40:14.744
what this job is all about.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.371
Now here's what
you're going to do.

40:16.373 --> 40:18.291
Push the dung ball
up to the flag line.

40:18.293 --> 40:20.166
The first to get it
there wins the job

40:20.168 --> 40:21.503
and mind those pets.

40:22.422 --> 40:23.505
Everybody clear?

40:24.340 --> 40:25.842
May the best lobby win.

40:28.802 --> 40:31.345
No one steals my job.

40:32.724 --> 40:34.057
For the tasty dung balls.

40:35.018 --> 40:37.267
Ready, and go.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.360
What a bad start.

40:47.070 --> 40:47.904
Oh boy.

40:50.407 --> 40:53.659
They're way ahead of me,
they must be cheating.

40:53.661 --> 40:54.912
Hey guys, wait for me.

40:59.708 --> 41:02.210
And I thought we were friends.

41:08.384 --> 41:12.260
McBroom, who do you
think is gonna be your man?

41:12.262 --> 41:14.972
Well I don't quite know.

41:14.974 --> 41:16.724
It ain't only about muscle.

41:16.726 --> 41:20.561
You gotta have passion and
of course you cannot forget

41:20.563 --> 41:22.065
about the element of surprise.

41:35.911 --> 41:36.913
Here I go.

41:47.465 --> 41:49.507
Hey bro, can you
spot check me?

41:49.509 --> 41:51.842
Keep it up, almost there.

41:58.559 --> 42:00.228
It looks like it was a draw.

42:10.697 --> 42:11.614
What the?

42:12.949 --> 42:16.617
Well it looks like we've got a
tie here.

42:16.619 --> 42:17.452
Now what?

42:18.371 --> 42:21.539
I guess we'll have to have
another run.

42:21.541 --> 42:25.003
This contest is rigged
and I'm going home.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.590
This next challenge
is going to be

42:31.592 --> 42:33.383
a wee bit tougher all right?

42:33.385 --> 42:36.137
The mission for this run
is you need to carry these

42:36.139 --> 42:38.224
dung balls all the
way across the river

42:39.224 --> 42:40.432
and don't get them wet.

42:40.434 --> 42:43.103
And also, take care
not to fall in the river.

42:44.063 --> 42:46.063
Sounds a bit intense.

43:16.679 --> 43:19.057
McBroom, perhaps we
should lower our standard?

43:20.807 --> 43:23.184
This job demands not
only physical strength

43:23.186 --> 43:26.186
but smarts as well and that's
exactly what I'll be testing

43:26.188 --> 43:27.271
in this round.

43:27.273 --> 43:29.356
Oh, it never occurred
to me that there's so much

43:29.358 --> 43:31.233
to learn just to
roll a dung ball.

43:31.235 --> 43:33.110
You're a master.

43:33.112 --> 43:34.947
Thank you Bartle Bee.

43:46.041 --> 43:48.083
I wonder what he's
trying to do over there.

43:48.085 --> 43:49.503
All right, all set.

44:05.436 --> 44:06.396
I made it.

44:09.898 --> 44:12.900
Wow, bravo,
nicely done mister.

44:12.902 --> 44:16.778
Good job, that was really
innovative and thoughtful.

44:16.780 --> 44:17.614
Thank you.

44:18.532 --> 44:19.741
Yeah, I did it.

44:20.617 --> 44:22.827
Congratulations McBroom,
you found yourself

44:22.829 --> 44:24.580
a really good helper in the sky.

44:29.418 --> 44:30.295
Oh yeah.

44:31.211 --> 44:32.043
What?

44:32.045 --> 44:33.588
I barely finished my
first day here.

44:33.590 --> 44:36.257
You just can't give
me the sack bro.

44:36.259 --> 44:37.425
Well that's fine by me.

44:37.427 --> 44:40.760
Good luck rolling your
own dung balls bro.

44:40.762 --> 44:42.014
Huh, McBroom?

44:43.432 --> 44:44.347
What happened?

44:44.349 --> 44:45.932
Why'd you fire him?

44:45.934 --> 44:50.940
Well I think I made a
mistake in hiring the guy.

44:51.273 --> 44:52.523
In what way?

44:52.525 --> 44:54.608
It turns out he's
just a big eater

44:54.610 --> 44:56.860
and a good for nothing lazy guy.

44:56.862 --> 44:59.447
All he ever did was
eat all my tasty food

44:59.449 --> 45:02.782
and goof around
doing absolutely nothing.

45:02.784 --> 45:05.577
Oh that's not on, he
took complete advantage.

45:05.579 --> 45:09.581
Ah Bartle Bee, I need to
hire someone hardworking,

45:09.583 --> 45:11.293
reliable, and honest.

45:12.711 --> 45:14.130
Why don't you work for me?

45:25.557 --> 45:27.559
Almost got this thing.

45:37.612 --> 45:38.528
That hurts.

45:40.280 --> 45:42.447
Huh, I tried everything
but I still can't

45:42.449 --> 45:43.826
get my hands on that fruit.

45:45.994 --> 45:48.246
Oh well, I'm going home
now for some cake.

45:53.168 --> 45:54.670
Cake, lovely cake.

45:55.672 --> 45:57.420
I love cake.

45:57.422 --> 45:59.965
Oh yeah, cake, cake,
lovely cake.

45:59.967 --> 46:00.969
I love cake.

46:02.427 --> 46:03.262
What was that?

46:05.139 --> 46:06.182
Must be my tummy.

46:08.518 --> 46:10.936
Hey cake, you're my favorite.

46:12.605 --> 46:14.771
Cake, cake, cake, cake.

46:14.773 --> 46:15.607
Hey, hey.

46:17.360 --> 46:18.358
Who's out there, show yourself.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.360
Don't make me angry.

46:20.362 --> 46:22.112
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

46:22.114 --> 46:23.782
Are my eyes playing
tricks on me?

46:24.992 --> 46:26.994
Well I really should get going.

46:29.706 --> 46:32.125
There is something out there.

46:37.463 --> 46:39.132
It's getting closer.

46:40.632 --> 46:41.466
It's a dead end.

46:43.927 --> 46:44.886
What to do?

46:55.856 --> 46:56.858
Who's there?

47:11.246 --> 47:13.081
It's just a ball.

47:15.043 --> 47:16.210
Nothing to worry about.

47:17.795 --> 47:19.130
It's just so pretty.

47:21.507 --> 47:22.925
And loads of fun.

47:24.217 --> 47:25.927
It sure is bouncy.

47:25.929 --> 47:27.972
Let's see how high it'll go.

47:31.768 --> 47:32.601
Ouchie.

47:37.648 --> 47:39.107
Oh, how dare you.

47:40.652 --> 47:41.485
Stupid ball.

47:43.695 --> 47:45.153
Oh, time for a snack then.

47:45.155 --> 47:46.988
I'm gonna take you home and see
what else

47:46.990 --> 47:47.822
you can do.

47:47.824 --> 47:49.117
I'm the man with the plan Stan.

47:50.452 --> 47:53.664
I'm a frog with a
big bouncy ball.

47:54.498 --> 47:57.417
I'm handsome and
that smells good.

47:58.293 --> 47:59.670
Yeah, cupcakes.

48:02.923 --> 48:07.804
Yummy.

48:09.429 --> 48:10.722
Take these outside.

48:12.599 --> 48:13.768
Whoa, help me.

48:23.152 --> 48:24.195
Oh, you, you.

48:32.911 --> 48:33.745
Stop it.

49:14.202 --> 49:15.704
Oh that's hurting.

49:26.340 --> 49:27.298
Life is just grand.

49:27.300 --> 49:29.052
I live for rolling dung
from dusk til dawn.

49:30.427 --> 49:32.470
Out of my way McBroom,
out of my way.

49:32.472 --> 49:34.679
Almost made it.

49:34.681 --> 49:35.724
Just a wee further.

49:59.081 --> 50:00.165
Disgusting.

50:03.628 --> 50:04.461
My ball.

50:06.547 --> 50:10.423
Once this is done, I
will have plenty of food.

50:10.425 --> 50:11.927
Hey McBroom, that's mine.

50:13.429 --> 50:17.889
Yah.

50:17.891 --> 50:20.435
My dung ball, what
happened to it?

50:21.353 --> 50:23.021
Well I've got my hands on you.

50:25.108 --> 50:27.986
Ugh, how did it
get a dent in it?

50:32.824 --> 50:35.782
I've got bruises all over
cause of you.

50:35.784 --> 50:36.952
You, I'm gonna get ya.

50:40.748 --> 50:42.498
You asked for it.

50:50.300 --> 50:51.467
Where'd it go?

50:56.722 --> 50:57.724
No way ball.

52:23.684 --> 52:24.978
That was close.

52:27.063 --> 52:28.648
Nothing could go wrong now.

52:32.610 --> 52:33.443
Ow.

52:35.070 --> 52:40.240
I'm the pond king frog
and the pond king snob.

52:40.242 --> 52:41.575
I really love that song.

52:41.577 --> 52:44.744
Yes siree that's the best
song I've ever heard.

52:44.746 --> 52:46.998
I'd bet there's not a better
song in the entire world.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.960
Oh yeah, oh you betcha.

52:51.420 --> 52:52.922
What's that thing?

52:54.047 --> 52:56.550
I'll go and have a look at it.

53:01.097 --> 53:04.100
Ah, it looks like a big old
swing thing.

53:08.688 --> 53:11.733
When I was young it was
fun, but now, not so.

53:13.025 --> 53:13.942
Maybe, hey.

53:17.280 --> 53:19.198
Oh yeah, this is great.

53:20.949 --> 53:24.244
Oh yeah, this is the funnest
thing ever.

53:25.954 --> 53:27.581
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:33.838 --> 53:34.672
Ow.

53:46.893 --> 53:49.311
What else can I use this for?

53:52.523 --> 53:53.358
I got it.

54:10.541 --> 54:12.001
Awesome, awesome.

54:13.585 --> 54:14.753
It's time to reload.

54:22.427 --> 54:24.552
Oh no, my dung
balls are getting away.

54:24.554 --> 54:27.099
Who in the world would
do such a thing?

54:29.351 --> 54:31.184
I'm such a marksmen, yeah.

54:31.186 --> 54:33.188
I haven't had this much
fun in like forever.

54:34.065 --> 54:35.858
So what should
be my next target?

54:37.693 --> 54:38.695
I got it.

54:56.545 --> 54:58.130
Excellent, reload.

55:08.099 --> 55:09.100
My last one.

55:10.226 --> 55:13.019
Hey Joe, check
out what I found.

55:13.021 --> 55:14.689
A delicious, red fruit.

55:16.356 --> 55:17.398
Huh, what are these?

55:17.400 --> 55:18.943
Ready, aim, fire.

55:26.617 --> 55:29.119
That's what I call modern art.

55:32.873 --> 55:36.418
Hey Cosmo, look, checkout
what I did over there.

55:38.420 --> 55:39.586
Guess what Joe?

55:39.588 --> 55:42.088
I found a fruit tree not far
from here.

55:42.090 --> 55:45.467
And the deliciousness
is all ours.

55:45.469 --> 55:46.927
Ooh, yum.

55:46.929 --> 55:48.306
I could picture that, yummy.

55:50.974 --> 55:52.641
I could taste it.

55:52.643 --> 55:54.392
So what are you waiting for?

55:54.394 --> 55:56.313
Come with me, hurry up.

56:07.951 --> 56:11.494
Hey Joe, there's the
tree I was talking about.

56:11.496 --> 56:13.289
Take a look, up there.

56:14.791 --> 56:17.083
There sure is a lot of
fruit on that tree there.

56:17.085 --> 56:18.668
I'm gonna get me one.

56:18.670 --> 56:19.796
Come on fruit.

56:28.679 --> 56:30.972
Just watch and
learn there, Cosmo.

56:30.974 --> 56:34.143
Take note of my expert fruit
picking technique here.

56:36.478 --> 56:38.646
I should warm up a little bit.

56:38.648 --> 56:40.313
One, two, three, four.

56:40.315 --> 56:41.315
Two, two, three, four.

56:41.317 --> 56:42.983
Three, three, three, four.

56:42.985 --> 56:45.237
All righty, here I come fruit.

56:46.280 --> 56:48.115
I'm gonna get ya.

56:56.456 --> 56:58.039
Oh shoot.

56:58.041 --> 56:59.168
They're much too high.

57:01.128 --> 57:02.130
I know what I'll do.

57:11.014 --> 57:12.012
Right, everything's set.

57:12.014 --> 57:12.931
Now watch this.

57:21.398 --> 57:22.481
Oh.

57:22.483 --> 57:23.318
You missed it.

57:26.820 --> 57:28.862
You missed it again.

57:28.864 --> 57:30.365
What's going on?

57:33.286 --> 57:35.869
Joe Croaker,
you're a lousy shot.

57:35.871 --> 57:37.623
You can't hit nothing.

57:39.166 --> 57:41.627
Keep quiet, just
watch this one, fire.

57:49.677 --> 57:52.555
Joe Croaker, that was close.

57:53.472 --> 57:55.555
Not even one fruit.

57:55.557 --> 57:57.182
I knew you were lying.

57:57.184 --> 57:59.894
I shouldn't have told
you about the tree.

57:59.896 --> 58:01.519
You're useless.

58:01.521 --> 58:05.108
What are you talking
about fly, sit down.

58:06.068 --> 58:07.485
What are you gonna do with me?

58:07.487 --> 58:08.735
Just relax.

58:08.737 --> 58:12.990
You'll find out, soon enough.

58:12.992 --> 58:14.827
Put me down Joe, no.

58:19.748 --> 58:20.832
I gotta stop.

58:25.922 --> 58:28.338
Joe Croaker, are you crazy?

58:28.340 --> 58:30.298
You trying to squash me?

58:30.300 --> 58:32.302
How dare you, take that back.

58:33.262 --> 58:38.226
Well, I was able to
shoot Cosmo up there.

58:38.851 --> 58:40.726
Hey, maybe it'll work for me.

58:40.728 --> 58:42.771
By gum, I'll get as
much as I want.

58:44.231 --> 58:45.606
I'm such a genius.

58:45.608 --> 58:47.151
Now let's get ready to fire.

58:48.902 --> 58:49.736
Adjusting.

59:11.134 --> 59:12.635
I think I made it.

59:25.981 --> 59:26.815
My back.

59:28.150 --> 59:28.984
Ah.

59:29.985 --> 59:31.401
The fruit.

59:42.498 --> 59:47.503
Don't mind if I do.

01:00:06.563 --> 01:00:07.397
Hey Joe.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:10.900
What?

01:00:10.902 --> 01:00:11.858
Hey Joe, guess what Joe?

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.695
I just saw a train over there.

01:00:15.197 --> 01:00:17.365
Chuga chuga chuga
chuga choo choo.

01:00:17.367 --> 01:00:19.702
It's very long, like a
centipede.

01:00:21.663 --> 01:00:23.204
I've seen plenty of things
longer than

01:00:23.206 --> 01:00:24.871
that trainy thing.

01:00:24.873 --> 01:00:26.331
Oh yeah?

01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:28.291
I highly suspect you
made that up.

01:00:28.293 --> 01:00:32.505
Oh Joe, it must be really
tough being a landlocked frog

01:00:32.507 --> 01:00:33.715
who can't fly and all.

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:38.680
I don't have to fly in order
to see the rest of the world.

01:00:41.766 --> 01:00:42.599
A train?

01:00:45.728 --> 01:00:47.355
I gotta see what it looks like.

01:00:50.775 --> 01:00:52.110
Yeah, that's it.

01:00:53.485 --> 01:00:55.904
I can get a better view
from the top of the tree.

01:00:58.949 --> 01:00:59.783
No.

01:01:02.327 --> 01:01:03.161
Ow.

01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:14.170
Hey there Joe.

01:01:14.172 --> 01:01:16.340
What are you doing?

01:01:16.342 --> 01:01:17.885
I know, you wanna see the train.

01:01:23.432 --> 01:01:25.391
Ah ha, I know.

01:01:25.393 --> 01:01:26.769
Just give me a minute Joe.

01:01:34.568 --> 01:01:35.445
Watch out Joe.

01:01:38.614 --> 01:01:41.033
Look, I got you this double
sided tape.

01:01:41.909 --> 01:01:43.700
Stick it on your hands
and feet and then

01:01:43.702 --> 01:01:45.121
you can climb up like this.

01:01:48.123 --> 01:01:50.125
That's not a bad idea.

01:01:55.715 --> 01:01:58.965
Hey.

01:01:58.967 --> 01:02:00.635
Check it, it really worked.

01:02:00.637 --> 01:02:02.138
Just as I foresaw.

01:02:03.556 --> 01:02:05.932
Hey look, my hands
are good and stuck now.

01:02:05.934 --> 01:02:07.557
Hey, help me with my foot?

01:02:07.559 --> 01:02:08.436
You got it.

01:02:13.273 --> 01:02:14.898
I'm all set now Cosmo.

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.316
Yeah, good job.

01:02:16.318 --> 01:02:18.028
Now just head for
the top, come on.

01:02:18.905 --> 01:02:21.324
You just wait, I'll be
the best tree frog ever.

01:02:29.498 --> 01:02:32.833
What's happening Cosmo, I
can't unstuck myself at all.

01:02:32.835 --> 01:02:34.168
Let me see.

01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:36.836
Joe, maybe I shouldn't
have grabbed that mega

01:02:36.838 --> 01:02:39.507
ultra sticky tape.

01:02:39.509 --> 01:02:40.510
So I'm stuck?

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:44.346
Well you know Joe,
I gotta go, later.

01:02:46.306 --> 01:02:48.391
Cosmo, get back here.

01:02:48.393 --> 01:02:50.226
You gotta get me
off of this tree.

01:02:50.228 --> 01:02:51.061
Come on.

01:02:52.813 --> 01:02:55.649
You gotta get me
off of this tree.

01:03:06.119 --> 01:03:07.870
Must be a better way.

01:03:09.706 --> 01:03:11.374
Joe, look at this.

01:03:16.713 --> 01:03:19.045
Cosmo, what'd you bring
me this rope thingy for?

01:03:19.047 --> 01:03:22.717
It's the answer to your
problems, check it out.

01:03:22.719 --> 01:03:25.760
We just hook this onto
the tree and then you can

01:03:25.762 --> 01:03:27.014
climb up to the top.

01:03:31.768 --> 01:03:32.851
Are you sure this is gonna
work?

01:03:32.853 --> 01:03:34.813
You can always trust old
Cosmo.

01:03:37.233 --> 01:03:38.735
Okay, you're on.

01:03:52.706 --> 01:03:54.041
Come on Joe, come on.

01:04:13.478 --> 01:04:16.436
Hey, it's working.

01:04:16.438 --> 01:04:19.356
Hey there little buddy,
this is working great.

01:04:26.239 --> 01:04:29.240
Are you all right Joe,
wake up, wake up, come on.

01:04:29.242 --> 01:04:30.242
Will you stop that?

01:04:30.244 --> 01:04:32.662
I shouldn't have trusted
you in the first place.

01:04:32.664 --> 01:04:35.039
Now go away, do you hear me?

01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:39.629
I'm sorry Joe, I
was just trying to help you.

01:04:45.635 --> 01:04:46.469
Whoa.

01:04:48.721 --> 01:04:49.554
Whoa.

01:04:52.474 --> 01:04:55.141
Hi ya.

01:04:55.143 --> 01:04:57.811
Why do you look so sad?

01:04:57.813 --> 01:04:59.315
Anything I can do?

01:05:02.318 --> 01:05:04.570
And that's what happened.

01:05:05.697 --> 01:05:09.534
So Joe Croaker wants
to climb up a tree huh?

01:05:11.952 --> 01:05:13.538
I've got an idea.

01:05:16.666 --> 01:05:18.001
Hey Joe, come here.

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:24.255
Hey Joe, Joe Croaker, listen.

01:05:24.257 --> 01:05:26.134
Guess what, we got a plan.

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:28.800
Get off.

01:05:28.802 --> 01:05:30.845
Cosmo, I don't trust you
anymore.

01:05:30.847 --> 01:05:31.889
Take it easy Joe.

01:05:33.766 --> 01:05:37.767
Just give me one last chance
and if it fails this time

01:05:37.769 --> 01:05:39.021
you can hate me.

01:05:41.523 --> 01:05:43.192
Look, follow me Joe.

01:05:45.695 --> 01:05:49.988
It's a stapler, also
known as a ladder maker.

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:51.199
Ladder maker?

01:06:03.545 --> 01:06:07.048
Come on Joe,
come on Joe, you can do it,

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:08.048
you're the best.

01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:10.177
Come on Joe, come on Joe.

01:06:17.893 --> 01:06:19.436
Yeah, you did it Joe.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.485
Gorgeous, yeah.

01:06:26.485 --> 01:06:30.320
Hey Joe,
it's getting dark, let's go.

01:06:30.322 --> 01:06:32.197
I worked so hard
to get up here

01:06:32.199 --> 01:06:34.992
I plan to spend the
entire evening right here.

01:06:34.994 --> 01:06:37.452
All right then,
see ya tomorrow.

01:06:37.454 --> 01:06:40.248
Good night little buddy.

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:44.251
I just knew I'd make it
to the top eventually.

01:06:44.253 --> 01:06:46.753
I just didn't get
to see the train.

01:06:46.755 --> 01:06:49.632
At least I proved I could do it.

01:06:49.634 --> 01:06:51.885
Now I gotta see how
many staples it took.

01:06:58.184 --> 01:06:59.641
That's a long way.

01:06:59.643 --> 01:07:01.851
If I fell I'd be done for.

01:07:01.853 --> 01:07:03.313
How do I get down from here?

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:08.987
Cosmo, Cosmo, help.
