00:04.879 --> 00:06.339
My name is Bridget.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.008
I witnessed a murder.

00:08.049 --> 00:10.427
Just get up on the stand
and tell the judge
what you saw,

00:10.468 --> 00:12.303
-and we'll protect you.
-You don't get it.

00:12.345 --> 00:15.515
Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:15.557 --> 00:19.102
BRIDGET: I ran to my sister,
Siobhan, for help.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.854
Siobhan? Siobhan!

00:20.895 --> 00:23.898
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.316
It was so easy.

00:25.358 --> 00:28.028
I saw a way out, and I took it.

00:28.069 --> 00:29.112
They all think that I'm her.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.447
Her husband...

00:30.488 --> 00:31.948
I'm falling in love
with Andrew.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.033
Her stepdaughter.

00:33.074 --> 00:34.159
He forced himself
on me!

00:34.200 --> 00:36.453
You had sex
with Mr. Carpenter?

00:36.494 --> 00:37.579
Her lover.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.039
Tell me what you did
to my wife!

00:39.080 --> 00:40.081
Her best friend.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.083
Why are you doing
this to me?!

00:42.125 --> 00:45.920
Don't blame me.
Blame Siobhan.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.422
I told you not
to kill Gemma.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.174
You're not a killer,
Siobhan.

it has been forever!

02:14.509 --> 02:15.718
Hey.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.761
Jeff, good to see you.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.013
Oh, these are for you.

02:19.055 --> 02:22.809
Thank you.
They're beautiful.

02:22.851 --> 02:27.147
-Are they peonies?
-Mm-hmm.

02:27.188 --> 02:29.274
That's Charlie's
handwriting.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.984
What's "Pivoine"?

02:35.989 --> 02:37.782
What a lovely gesture.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.122
What, you don't like
the flowers?

02:44.164 --> 02:47.542
That's funny, I thought
peonies were your favorite.

02:47.584 --> 02:51.212
No, they're-they're
stunning. Thank you.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.006
Aren't peonies
out of season?

02:53.047 --> 02:54.090
You must have
gone to

02:54.132 --> 02:55.633
a lot of trouble
to get these.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.595
Oh, anything for you.

02:58.636 --> 03:01.598
You really want to
do this now?

03:01.639 --> 03:02.932
JEFFREY: What do
you think, ladies?

03:02.974 --> 03:04.767
A bottle of Rothschild
for the table?

03:04.809 --> 03:06.269
Uh, actually,
I'll pass.

03:06.311 --> 03:09.939
I'm just gonna have
water, thank you.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.150
You know what, actually,
I think I'll pass, also.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.610
Really?

03:13.651 --> 03:14.944
What's up with you two?

03:14.986 --> 03:16.613
What is this, a cleanse
or something?

03:16.654 --> 03:17.989
I thought carbs
were trendy again.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.324
[chuckles]

03:19.365 --> 03:21.910
Our daughter would
rather drink poison

03:21.951 --> 03:23.203
than touch pasta.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.288
Oh, speaking of which,
how's Juliet?

03:25.330 --> 03:27.081
Is she still going
to Eastlake Prep?

03:27.123 --> 03:29.667
No, she's
at Zachary Secor High.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.794
-The public school?
-Really?

03:31.836 --> 03:33.129
GREER: Wow!

03:33.171 --> 03:34.756
My foundation is hosting

03:34.797 --> 03:37.133
a charity auction event
for Zachary later this week.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.968
-That's your foundation?
-Yeah.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.345
Well, somebody called this week
about making a donation.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.388
I didn't realize
you were involved.

03:42.430 --> 03:43.556
Greer's pet project.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.308
GREER: It's such
a great cause.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.768
It's my passion.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.478
I mean, public schools
are so underfunded,

03:48.519 --> 03:49.979
and with the current
budget situation...

03:50.021 --> 03:51.648
Okay, I won't you bore you
with the details.

03:51.689 --> 03:54.234
But we are hosting a series
of events to raise money

03:54.275 --> 03:57.570
for public schools,
and Zachary is the next event.

03:57.612 --> 03:58.988
I think
that's great.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.823
I'm a big advocate
for public schools.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.659
And it's been great
for Juliet

04:02.700 --> 04:04.702
just to meet all
different kinds of kids

04:04.744 --> 04:07.121
and see that the world
doesn't revolve
around money.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.502
What?

04:12.543 --> 04:15.505
Nothing. Just...
going to bat for
public schools,

04:15.546 --> 04:17.799
it's so not like you.

04:17.840 --> 04:21.010
You know, I would
love to help you
with your auction.

04:21.052 --> 04:25.556
It'll give us
a chance to spend
some time together.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.975
Really?

04:27.016 --> 04:28.184
Yeah.

04:33.398 --> 04:37.068
I-I, uh, I really appreciate
you coming, Agent Machado.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.403
No, no, I'm sorry I didn't
get back to you sooner.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.196
I was, uh, in Wyoming
wrapping something up.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.323
-Have a seat if you want.
-Thank you.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.117
But I'm
a-a little confused.

04:44.158 --> 04:47.453
If this is about Gemma's case,
NYPD's handling that.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.038
Yeah, uh, they barely
talk to me anymore.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.748
They make me feel
like I'm crazy.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.500
And they're acting
like the case is closed

04:52.542 --> 04:53.626
and they shouldn't be.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.004
Well, what have
they told you?

04:56.045 --> 04:57.422
They told me Charlie Young,
or John Delario,

04:57.463 --> 04:59.132
or whatever the hell
he's calling himself,

04:59.173 --> 05:02.176
uh, that he shot
and killed my wife

05:02.218 --> 05:03.845
and then he shot himself.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.638
But that's not everything.
There's more evidence.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.098
They found Bridget's
fingerprints,

05:07.140 --> 05:09.600
the gun that was used
to kill Gemma

05:09.642 --> 05:11.144
was traced back
to Bridget.

05:11.185 --> 05:13.521
So why aren't they
looking for her?

05:13.563 --> 05:16.441
Believe me, Mr. Butler,
I-I share your frustrations.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.276
It's a complicated situation--

05:18.318 --> 05:19.861
I can't get
into the details--

05:19.902 --> 05:22.405
but trust me when I tell you
I haven't given up.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.657
I'm doing everything
I can to find Bridget.

05:24.699 --> 05:28.911
It doesn't make
any sense.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.164
Gemma didn't
know Bridget.

05:31.205 --> 05:34.250
She didn't know Charlie,
so what do they
want with her?

05:34.292 --> 05:36.002
Maybe a crime of opportunity.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.587
Bridget needed money.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.756
Kidnapping her sister's
wealthy friend

05:39.797 --> 05:42.675
for a ransom may have seemed
like an easy score.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.011
Siobhan...

05:45.053 --> 05:47.263
Of course.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.515
It all comes back
to her.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.100
ANDREW:
So...

05:51.142 --> 05:55.521
you and Greer working on
a fund-raiser together.

05:55.563 --> 05:58.775
That's the last thing
I expected.

05:58.816 --> 06:01.069
I was just pleased
you agreed to dinner.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.278
You were?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.405
You usually avoid her
like the plague.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.366
Makes it difficult
to see Jeff.

06:06.407 --> 06:09.786
Maybe there's something
I could do.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.621
You know, maybe I could
apologize to her.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.623
Do you have something
to apologize for?

06:13.664 --> 06:15.958
I never told you
what happened?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.668
No.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.670
Do you want to talk
about it?

06:19.712 --> 06:20.922
Nah.

06:20.963 --> 06:22.298
Let me just leave
the past in the past.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.968
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask you.

06:26.010 --> 06:29.889
Do you think something's
off with Juliet?

06:29.931 --> 06:32.141
She's been so...
quiet.

06:32.183 --> 06:35.311
I don't know.
Less...combative.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.897
Isn't that
a good thing?

06:37.939 --> 06:40.858
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.527
She had a tough year.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.278
It'll be good for her--
new year, back to school.

06:46.030 --> 06:48.991
[sighs]
I'm so tired.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.339
You know,
if you don't like the ring,

07:03.381 --> 07:05.591
we can
always trade it in.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.677
Something smaller,
perhaps?

07:07.718 --> 07:10.513
The only thing that I want
smaller is the band.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.849
It keeps falling off.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.518
I should probably
take it to get resized.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.646
Then the fit will be
as perfect as
the rest of it.

07:18.688 --> 07:19.981
Mm!

07:27.905 --> 07:30.158
[phone ringing]

07:32.201 --> 07:34.454

07:34.495 --> 07:36.038

07:36.080 --> 07:37.707

to get in touch with you.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.081
Are you there?

08:19.123 --> 08:21.000
Yeah, I'm here.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.711
I've been meaning to call you.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.421
I thought you'd be back
in Paris by now.

Oh, Mrs. Martin,
you scared me!

08:33.137 --> 08:37.099
Claudine, I'm so sorry.

08:37.141 --> 08:38.518
Oh, no, it's okay.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.852
I just wasn't
expecting you.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.354
It's so early.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.481
It's early for you, too.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.649
Olivia still
cracking the whip?

08:44.690 --> 08:46.776
No, Ms. Charles is
still in London.

08:46.817 --> 08:49.320
I just like to get
a jump on the day.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.863
Can I help you
with something?

08:50.905 --> 08:53.533
You know, maybe you can.

08:53.574 --> 08:54.617
Well, if you can
keep a secret.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.410
Mm-hmm.

08:56.452 --> 08:57.870
I want to throw my husband
a surprise party,

08:57.912 --> 09:00.831
but I can't seem to get
into his address book.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.458
Any chance you have
his password?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.460
Mmm. No.
Sorry, I don't.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.212
Can I help
with anything else?

09:06.254 --> 09:08.881
No, that's it,
a-and do me a favor.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.591
Let's just keep this
between each other.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.677
I wouldn't want
to ruin the surprise.

Fine.

Oh, damn it!

09:29.277 --> 09:31.904
Oh, sorry--got a
presentation today,

09:31.946 --> 09:33.656
and the computer
guy's just canceled.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.825
Come on, I'll
drop you at school.

09:35.866 --> 09:37.868
Actually, I'm not
feeling so great.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.162
I think I'm getting
that stomach thing

09:40.204 --> 09:42.290
that's going around.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.125
You weren't sick
yesterday.

09:44.166 --> 09:47.670
I started feeling badly
when you and Siobhan
were at dinner.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.463
You ordered a pizza.
You're fine.
Come on, Juliet.

09:49.505 --> 09:50.715
I don't have time
for this today.

09:50.756 --> 09:52.967
Car leaves in five.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.511
BRIDGET:
Have a good day.

09:55.553 --> 09:59.390
It sucks going back
after two weeks, huh?

09:59.432 --> 10:03.519
[elevator bell dings,
phone ringing]

10:03.561 --> 10:04.937
You know, maybe I
could talk to your dad

10:04.979 --> 10:07.023
and see if I can get
him to lighten up.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.274
Whatever.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.651
Just pick up your phone.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.949
[sighs]

10:18.075 --> 10:19.201
Hello?

10:19.243 --> 10:20.536
It's me.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.038
I can't make group today.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.831
You should go
without me.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.709
Oh, actually,
I can't make it, either.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.211
You've been missing a lot
of meetings lately, Bridge.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.339
I'll be at the next one,
I promise.

10:31.380 --> 10:34.842
Good. I hate going alone.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.177
Everyone's asking
about Charlie.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.054
Like they think
I can explain what he did.

10:38.095 --> 10:41.515
I wish I could
explain it.

10:41.557 --> 10:42.892
I gotta go.

10:42.933 --> 10:44.602

10:44.644 --> 10:48.105
If I don't find
something soon,

I may have to move on.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.401
You know, Andrew
mentioned something

10:52.443 --> 10:54.195
about needing
a computer guy.

10:54.236 --> 10:55.571
Maybe you could
do that.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.281
Computer guy?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.575
I'm computer science prof,
not a tech.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.202
It's one afternoon.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.662
I'll text you
his number.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.498
[whistle blows]

11:05.539 --> 11:07.667
[school bell rings]

11:07.708 --> 11:09.126
What the hell
are you doing here?

11:09.168 --> 11:11.837
Receiving a sub-par
education, same as you.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.006
[sighs]

11:14.048 --> 11:15.800
-Oh, my God.
-What?

11:15.841 --> 11:18.469
You still haven't
told your parents
about Mr. Carpenter.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.263
Juliet, he made you
have sex with him.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.848
Okay, you have
to tell them.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.350
Would you keep
the volume down?

11:24.392 --> 11:26.060
Look I get it--
I understand

11:26.102 --> 11:27.395
that you're embarrassed
or whatever,

11:27.436 --> 11:29.021
but it's not your fault.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.356
You need help.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.608
No, I don't.

11:34.235 --> 11:37.863
I just want to forget
it happened and move on.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.034
Okay?

11:42.076 --> 11:44.537
MR. CARPENTER:
I think, uh, you
and I should talk.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.372
All right.
Thanks, Mr. C.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.757
SIOBHAN:
Hey. Sorry about hanging up

11:56.799 --> 11:58.676
on you earlier.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.053
Everything okay?

12:01.095 --> 12:03.723
Yeah. I just have to take care
of one thing.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.808
Tyler, I know
you don't trust me,

12:05.850 --> 12:07.184
but I'm trying to get back.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.228
Well, it's a little hard
to trust you

12:09.270 --> 12:12.314
when you were using me
to get back at your husband.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.985
So this thing that you
have to take care of--

12:16.026 --> 12:19.155
does it involve Andrew?

12:19.196 --> 12:20.614
Have you seen him?

12:20.656 --> 12:22.992
I don't want him
to know that I'm here.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.579
Look, Martin/Charles
just released

12:26.620 --> 12:27.997
their year-end statements.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.915
I'm just trying to get
my hands on a copy.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.375
Tell me why.

12:31.417 --> 12:35.296
You know, since we're
trusting each other.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.757
Am I talking to Tyler Barrett,
loyal employee,

12:37.798 --> 12:40.676
or Tyler Barrett...

12:40.718 --> 12:42.762
the father of my baby?

12:42.803 --> 12:44.764
How about a guy who's got

12:44.805 --> 12:46.140
a high-level job
at Martin/Charles?

12:46.182 --> 12:48.017
If Andrew's doing
something illegal,

12:48.058 --> 12:50.269
I'd like to get out
before you expose him.

12:52.354 --> 12:53.856
Okay.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.275
Look, I believe
that Andrew issues

12:56.317 --> 12:57.610
one set of statements
to his investors,

12:57.651 --> 12:59.612
but I think he keeps
the real ones hidden.

12:59.653 --> 13:02.490
Uh, I want to get my hands
on one so I have some proof,

13:02.531 --> 13:05.701
but his office security
is just too tight.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.870
Can you get
into your apartment

13:07.912 --> 13:09.538
without Andrew knowing
you were there?

13:09.580 --> 13:11.248
Uh, I would imagine so.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.792
Why?

13:12.833 --> 13:14.627
Because home security
tends to be

13:14.668 --> 13:16.128
more lax than
office security,

13:16.170 --> 13:18.464
even though we have
information in both places.

13:18.506 --> 13:21.967
If you want to hack Andrew,
home is the place.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.303
Thank you.

13:24.345 --> 13:27.139
Oh, uh, Tyler,
I-I have to run.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.308
I-I...I will call you.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.228
[door bell jingling]

13:32.269 --> 13:33.479
Henry!

13:38.192 --> 13:40.236
God, it's so good
to see you.

13:40.277 --> 13:43.405
What are you...
what are you
doing here, Siobhan?

13:43.447 --> 13:45.157
Well, I...I know you
always come this way

13:45.199 --> 13:49.829
after you drop
the boys at school,
and I needed to see you.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.498
I miss you.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.666
You know who I miss?

13:53.707 --> 13:55.334
My wife.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.630
You brought Bridget Kelly
into our lives.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.049
And if it wasn't
for you...

14:02.091 --> 14:04.134
Gemma would be
here today.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.720
Wait. Please don't go.

14:06.762 --> 14:08.764
Henry, I can
explain this.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.349
Sit down with me.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.103
I-I can explain
everything. I swear.

14:18.148 --> 14:20.693
You, uh, you have something
you want to say to me...

14:20.734 --> 14:21.819
you say it right now.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.280
I-I can't right
on the street.

14:24.321 --> 14:26.448
I mean, just...
give me five minutes.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.950
Please, I'll
explain everything.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.201
I'm busy.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.536
I'm swamped with
publisher meetings.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.871
For your book?

14:31.912 --> 14:33.497
Henry, that's great.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.875
Since when do you care
about my book?

14:37.501 --> 14:39.086
No matter what happened,

14:39.128 --> 14:41.422
I think you're
an amazing writer.

14:41.463 --> 14:42.506
You know that.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.052
Save it, Siobhan.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.429
I'm late.

14:48.470 --> 14:49.555
Taxi!

15:01.609 --> 15:03.485
Siobhan, are
you okay?

15:06.822 --> 15:08.908
Yeah.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.869
It's just been
a rough couple days.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.413
[sighs]

15:14.455 --> 15:15.664
Uh, you know what?

15:15.706 --> 15:17.583
Maybe I can, uh...
I don't know,

15:17.625 --> 15:18.918
maybe I can move
some stuff around.

15:18.959 --> 15:20.252
You want to meet
on Friday?

15:20.294 --> 15:21.837
10:00 a.m.?

15:21.879 --> 15:24.840
Okay.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.259
Usual place?

15:27.301 --> 15:29.303
No, we don't have
a usual place anymore.

15:31.513 --> 15:32.723
How about the loft?

15:32.765 --> 15:35.059
I'll see you there.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.612
Bridget Kelly's a ghost.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.948
I...I can't even prove
that she was in New York

15:48.989 --> 15:50.282
when Gemma Butler
was murdered.

15:50.324 --> 15:53.202
Forensics on the gun
seem pretty conclusive.

15:53.243 --> 15:56.455
Charlie Young, aka John Delario,
was the shooter.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.706
Yeah, I don't doubt
he killed Gemma Butler.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.124
I doubt he killed himself.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.168
You think someone
staged the scene?

16:01.210 --> 16:03.003
Angle of
the gun was off.

16:03.045 --> 16:05.297
And Delario's hands
tested positive
for powder residue,

16:05.339 --> 16:06.966
but trace amounts.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.801
Which point to him
having fired the gun
hours before,

16:08.842 --> 16:10.761
and yet he died
instantaneously.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.846
NYPD seem to
believe otherwise.

16:12.888 --> 16:14.306
Yeah, because Delario
is one of their own.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.100
They want this
whole thing to
go away quickly.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.894
And bringing
Bridget Kelly into it
only complicates things.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.397
Why would Kelly
kill Delario?

16:21.438 --> 16:24.024
Hell if I know.
I...heh.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.901
The Bridget Kelly
I knew in Wyoming

16:25.943 --> 16:27.736
was not a kidnapper
or a killer.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.947
Okay, let's
just focus

16:29.989 --> 16:31.198
on what's
in front of us.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.825
Let's try to figure
out how and why

16:32.866 --> 16:34.410
Bridget and Charlie
became a team.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.745
I mean, seriously,
how does a stripper
from Wyoming

16:36.787 --> 16:39.081
hook up with a retired
cop from Brooklyn?

16:39.123 --> 16:40.916
Did a little digging
into your guy.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.585
Traffic cam shows him
blowing through a red light

16:43.627 --> 16:47.172
on September 8,
driving down Montauk Highway.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.924
John Delario
was driving

16:48.966 --> 16:51.593
on the main road into
the Hamptons, September 8?

16:51.635 --> 16:53.721
The same weekend
Bridget Kelly was there.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.514
Could be just
a coincidence.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.976
Or it could be where
this whole thing started.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.395
Our new high-frequency program

17:01.437 --> 17:03.897
employs computerized algorithms
that operate

17:03.939 --> 17:07.609
at a speed unmatched
by traditional trading methods.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.945
Since its implementation,

17:09.987 --> 17:13.741
returns here at Martin/Charles
have been up over 30%.

17:13.782 --> 17:15.200
MAN: Wow.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.953
Now, as you can see,

17:17.995 --> 17:20.748
our one-, three- and five-year
growth projections

17:20.789 --> 17:23.625
in HFT are quite impressive.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.794
What about the
ten-year projection?

17:25.836 --> 17:27.463
Can you hold that
rate of growth?

17:27.504 --> 17:28.672
Oh, I believe that we can.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.215
Unfortunately,

17:30.257 --> 17:32.968
our software designer
isn't here with us today,

17:33.010 --> 17:35.554
so I'll have to get back to you
with specific numbers.

17:35.596 --> 17:36.930
MALCOLM:
Actually, Andrew,

17:36.972 --> 17:38.515
all the data for
those projections
is here.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.726
If you'd like,
I can run
a quick program,

17:40.768 --> 17:43.145
figure out those
numbers for you.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.855
Oh. Wonderful.
Thank you, Malcolm.

17:44.897 --> 17:48.067
If you wouldn't
all mind bearing with us.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.193
MAN:
Not at all.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.195
[typing]

17:56.700 --> 18:01.872
Well, as you can see,
we can hold that rate of growth.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.752
BRIDGET: Okay, this should be
the last of it.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.004
All right, I know
this seems daunting,

18:09.046 --> 18:11.924
but, uh, most of the auction
items are already labeled.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.718
We just have to come up
with minimum bids

18:14.760 --> 18:15.761
and sort
through everything.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.137
Oh, and we got
to figure out

18:17.179 --> 18:18.639
a layout for the, uh,
night of the party.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.683
Okay, that sounds
like a lot.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.936
I'm happy to help.

18:26.271 --> 18:29.066
I know it
must seem weird,
my offering to help.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.027
I...I realize things
have been...

18:32.069 --> 18:34.029
strained between us.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.865
To be honest,
I was shocked

18:36.907 --> 18:38.408
that you actually
followed through.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.494
I thought you
were just putting on

18:40.536 --> 18:42.121
a good face
for our husbands.

18:42.162 --> 18:45.833
I really want things to
be better between us.

18:45.874 --> 18:49.837
I mean, we were
friends once, right?

18:49.878 --> 18:51.588
I thought we were.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.632
Until that weekend.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.928
You know, maybe if we
talked about it...

18:57.970 --> 18:59.513
You know what?
We did enough talking.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.806
Or at least you did.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.850
You practically
threatened me.

19:02.891 --> 19:04.810
I never said anything
about what I saw,

19:04.852 --> 19:06.812
so I just would like that
to be the end of it.

19:09.189 --> 19:12.234
Greer, I'm not the person
that I used to be, and...

19:12.276 --> 19:16.196
I'm definitely not the
person I was that weekend.

19:16.238 --> 19:19.074
I-I hope you'll give me
the chance to prove it.

19:19.116 --> 19:22.035
[elevator bell dings,
doors slide open]

19:22.077 --> 19:23.078
JULIET:
Hey.

19:24.371 --> 19:26.498
Didn't realize
you had company.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.084
Juliet, you remember
Mrs. Sheridan?

19:29.126 --> 19:30.586
She's in charge
of your school benefit.

19:30.627 --> 19:31.879
Hi, Juliet.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.422
-It's good to see you again.
-Hi.

19:33.463 --> 19:35.340
You know what?
I really should get going.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.134
Are you okay
with everything here?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.970
-Not a problem.
-Great.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.306
And, uh, Greer,
I-I would love to revisit this,

19:42.347 --> 19:45.267
you know, sometime,
if you're willing to...

19:45.309 --> 19:46.310
[elevator bell dings]

19:46.351 --> 19:47.853
Hey, so this,
uh, thing

19:47.895 --> 19:49.354
you're doing
tomorrow night,

19:49.396 --> 19:52.691
you're not going
to make me go, are you?

19:52.733 --> 19:55.194
Well, considering it's 20 feet
from your bedroom,

19:55.235 --> 19:57.696
I was hoping you would at least
put in an appearance.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.698
-What?
-I offered up the apartment.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.367
They wanted
an intimate setting.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.036
It's not that big a deal.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.287
I mean, it's just some
board members and their guests

20:05.329 --> 20:08.040
and a few people
from your school.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.541
You mean, like,
teachers?

20:11.293 --> 20:15.631
Please tell me
you didn't invite
Mr. Carpenter.

20:15.672 --> 20:16.882
I thought he was
your favorite.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.050
No.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.551
No. There's no way.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.512
I-I'm not going
to your stupid
fund-raiser.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.514
-Juliet, what's wrong?
-Nothing.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.144
It's just...

20:29.186 --> 20:33.273
I have to see
my stupid teachers
every day at school,

20:33.315 --> 20:36.902
and now I have to deal
with them in my own house?

20:36.944 --> 20:38.195
You were
a great help today.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.864
Never seen anyone
write code so quickly.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.824
Claudine will
give you a call

20:42.866 --> 20:45.118
when she cuts
your check.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.080
You know, if you
ever feel like
changing fields,

20:48.121 --> 20:49.915
give me a call.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.584
We could use
someone like you.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.087
Wow. I'm flattered.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.050
[distant siren wailing]

21:00.092 --> 21:02.261
[helicopter passing overhead]

21:18.610 --> 21:20.237
Ah, thank you,
Jessie.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.822
JESSIE:
You're welcome, sir.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.991
[indistinct
conversation]

21:24.032 --> 21:25.325
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, see you later.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.410
Thank you, sir.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.375
Hey, Henry, it's me.

21:33.417 --> 21:36.420
I-I might be a few minutes late,
but I'm coming, so...

21:36.461 --> 21:39.006
wait for me, please.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.050
[bell dings]

22:30.724 --> 22:31.850
[typing]

22:34.686 --> 22:35.854
[beeping]

22:40.567 --> 22:41.526
[beeping]

22:49.951 --> 22:51.286
[sighs softly]

23:14.643 --> 23:15.811
[elevator bell dings]

23:15.852 --> 23:17.020
[gasps]

23:33.954 --> 23:36.832
[cell phone ringing]

23:36.873 --> 23:39.209
Andrew Martin.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.878
Olivia.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.131
Yeah. Hang on.
Y-You're breaking up.

23:45.549 --> 23:48.260
Mm-hmm. Go ahead.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.971
Look, could you
talk slower?

23:51.012 --> 23:53.265
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.394
Look, we should make sure
we get a better line

23:57.436 --> 24:00.647
if you're gonna
patch him through.

24:00.689 --> 24:01.940
Mm.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.066
Actually, it's
better now, really.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.360
John, how are you?

24:05.402 --> 24:06.361
Good.

24:17.122 --> 24:20.041
Screw you, Siobhan.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.501
Right.

24:21.543 --> 24:23.587
I'll check when I'm back
in the office.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.046
Excellent.
So you're happy?

24:25.088 --> 24:26.965
Wonderful, wonderful.
That's great news.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.133
[elevator bell dings]

24:28.175 --> 24:29.176
Okay, thanks.
Talk to you soon.

24:29.217 --> 24:30.385
Bye.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.928
I didn't expect
you to be here.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.597
ANDREW: I forgot
my briefcase.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.515
BRIDGET: I'm gonna get that
thing chained to your wrist.

24:35.557 --> 24:36.808
[Andrew chuckles]

24:36.850 --> 24:38.226
Did you get a chance
to talk to Juliet?

24:38.268 --> 24:40.479
I did. And
she swore that
everything was fine.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.397
Even promised to
make an appearance
at the party tonight.

24:42.439 --> 24:43.398
BRIDGET: Really?

24:43.440 --> 24:45.442
I guess I overreacted.

24:45.484 --> 24:49.029
She was just acting so funny
when I mentioned that teacher.

24:49.070 --> 24:51.114
Maybe he gave
her a bad grade.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.867
You buy a new
dress yet?

24:53.909 --> 24:55.535
BRIDGET: I've narrowed
IT down to three.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.997
But I can't decide if I want
to go big or understated

24:59.039 --> 25:00.457
to show off the amazing ring

25:00.499 --> 25:03.001
that my impossibly handsome
husband gave me.

25:06.129 --> 25:07.839
Doesn't matter what
dress you choose,

25:07.881 --> 25:10.258
I'll only be thinking
about how I can
tear it off.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.177
Hmm, I like
the way you think.

25:16.473 --> 25:17.641
Oh, you
should go to work.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.851
I have a million
things I have to do.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.603
To be continued?

25:21.645 --> 25:23.146
Most definitely.

25:27.275 --> 25:28.276
[elevator bell dings]

25:47.754 --> 25:49.673
[sighs]

25:49.714 --> 25:51.174
[shower running]

27:04.497 --> 27:05.540
[sighs]

27:05.582 --> 27:07.000
[line ringing]

27:07.042 --> 27:09.294
Come on, Henry, pick up.
Pick up.

27:09.336 --> 27:10.420
HENRY: Hey, you've reached
Henry Butler.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.463
Please leave a message
at the tone.

27:11.504 --> 27:12.797
Damn it.

27:26.603 --> 27:27.562
[gasps]

27:29.856 --> 27:31.983
[phone ringing]

27:34.486 --> 27:36.154
Hello.

27:36.196 --> 27:39.658
The caterers are here already?

27:39.699 --> 27:40.950
Uh, yeah, you can send them up.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.285
Could you also do me a favor?

27:42.327 --> 27:44.954
Can you see if you could
find me a plumber?

27:44.996 --> 27:48.166
Thank you.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.377
Really fun.

27:50.418 --> 27:51.544
ANDREW: Thank you so
much for coming.

27:51.586 --> 27:52.587
I really
appreciate it.

27:52.629 --> 27:53.797
Thanks for
your support.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.341
[music playing]

28:05.308 --> 28:07.310
GREER: I'm gonna
go mingle.

28:12.941 --> 28:15.819
You look amazing.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.863
You don't look
too shabby yourself.

28:18.905 --> 28:20.573
Where's your ring?

28:20.615 --> 28:22.867
Um, I...

28:22.909 --> 28:24.452
I took it to get resized.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.998
It fell off again today.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.418
Um, I really should have
taken it yesterday.

28:31.459 --> 28:34.421
Well, you'll just
have to show it off
at the next party.

28:34.462 --> 28:36.214
Any sign of Juliet?

28:36.256 --> 28:37.549
Not yet.

28:37.590 --> 28:39.426
Hmm.

28:39.467 --> 28:41.469
Can you see him?

28:42.971 --> 28:45.473
Mm, he seems
kind of bored.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.559
Maybe he'll leave.

28:49.811 --> 28:53.398
I still don't understand why
you won't talk to your parents.

28:55.608 --> 29:00.280
'Cause I don't want
to screw things up.

29:00.321 --> 29:03.992
I've done a lot
of crappy stuff.

29:04.033 --> 29:05.994
My stepmom used
to hate me.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.498
Sometimes I think
my dad did, too.

29:13.668 --> 29:16.629
But lately,
things are, like,

29:16.671 --> 29:19.924
not awful between us.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.760
It just got normal.

29:21.801 --> 29:24.053
And I kind of want
it to stay that way.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.727
Juliet,
you're not dressed yet?

29:30.769 --> 29:31.936
Do I have to
remind you how hard

29:31.978 --> 29:33.271
Siobhan has worked
on this party?

29:33.313 --> 29:35.774
I got it, Dad.

29:35.815 --> 29:37.317
Really, I do.

29:37.358 --> 29:41.279
I-I just, I can't get
dressed till you leave.

29:41.321 --> 29:44.449
Well, quick as you can, please.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.751
MAN: Quite simple,
actually.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.170
Okay, I think we've
shown enough school
spirit for one night.

29:57.212 --> 29:58.755
So let's just
congratulate
your stepmom

29:58.797 --> 30:00.715
and get the hell
out of here.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.133
Now's not a great time.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.595
WOMAN:
It's such a great party...

30:14.521 --> 30:16.523
-What are you...
-Don't judge. Support.

30:16.564 --> 30:18.691
It's the only way
I'll get through tonight.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.568
[chuckles]

30:20.610 --> 30:21.986
Okay.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.825
-You have to.
-Hey.

30:26.866 --> 30:29.202
Hey. I didn't expect
to see you.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.829
Really?

30:30.870 --> 30:32.622
Because you couldn't
stop calling me.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.959
I didn't call you.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.836
Did someone call you
from my number?

30:37.877 --> 30:40.296
No, the number
was blocked, but I...

30:40.338 --> 30:43.132
Are you seriously gonna
do this to me again?

30:43.174 --> 30:44.592
Wait, doing what to you?

30:44.634 --> 30:46.761
I had a meeting
at "The New Yorker" today,

30:46.803 --> 30:48.555
and I missed it because
of you, Siobhan.

30:48.596 --> 30:49.764
Wait, Henry, calm down...

30:49.806 --> 30:51.599
I'm done.
I am done with you.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.268
I do not want to see you,
I don't want to think about you,

30:53.309 --> 30:54.644
I don't even want
to talk to you again.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.770
You stay out of my life.

31:10.493 --> 31:12.161
Here.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.371
Thank you.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.290
Mm-hmm.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.631
Hey.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.216
You okay?

31:26.843 --> 31:28.344
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:31.264 --> 31:34.225
Henry seemed pretty upset.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.062
Yeah, he's not
doing so well.

31:38.104 --> 31:40.106
But you can't
really blame him.

31:41.357 --> 31:43.109
You guys still together?

31:45.737 --> 31:49.908
Um, no, I...
I ended it.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.453
Did Andrew find out?

31:53.494 --> 31:55.580
No.

31:55.622 --> 31:59.918
Greer, I-I know I
have no right to ask
you this, but...

31:59.959 --> 32:01.586
If I didn't say anything
after that weekend,

32:01.628 --> 32:02.921
I'm not going to now.

32:02.962 --> 32:07.300
That weekend where
we stopped speaking was

32:07.342 --> 32:11.220
because you found out
about the affair.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.431
It didn't just
destroy our friendship.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.683
It ruined my relationship
with Gemma.

32:15.725 --> 32:20.146
You know, I couldn't look her
in the eye after that.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.148
I hated you for that.

32:23.816 --> 32:25.777
I don't blame you.

32:25.818 --> 32:28.404
And I'm sorry.

32:28.446 --> 32:31.866
More sorry than I know
how to put into words.

32:35.828 --> 32:37.455
You know,
I have to admit,

32:37.497 --> 32:39.707
it's been really great
working with you this week.

32:39.749 --> 32:42.961
I've had
a good time, too.

32:43.002 --> 32:46.214
I just have to ask--

32:46.255 --> 32:50.301
the flowers you
brought to dinner
the other night...

32:50.343 --> 32:52.387
I was just being a bitch.

32:52.428 --> 32:55.181
I couldn't believe that
you actually said
yes to dinner,

32:55.223 --> 32:57.600
and I wanted to throw you
off your game.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.477
I'm sorry.

32:59.519 --> 33:00.645
It's okay.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.522
[sighs]

33:02.563 --> 33:05.108
Who would've
thought flowers
could mean so much?

33:05.149 --> 33:06.526
Yeah, well, I can't

33:06.567 --> 33:09.278
see peonies without
thinking about that weekend.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.614
They were all over
the hotel, remember?

33:11.656 --> 33:13.116
Hotel Pivoine.

33:16.577 --> 33:18.204
You know, I go to Boston
all the time,

33:18.246 --> 33:20.915
and I don't go anywhere near
that hotel anymore.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.837
[talking, laughing]

33:28.297 --> 33:30.550
You sure she's
young enough for you?

33:30.591 --> 33:32.510
'Cause...

33:32.552 --> 33:34.679
I know your type.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.514
And she's not it.

33:39.726 --> 33:42.562
Excuse me.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.731
Juliet.

33:44.772 --> 33:46.649
I think, uh,
you and I should talk...

33:46.691 --> 33:48.526
Don't touch me!

33:48.568 --> 33:50.486
I got it.

33:50.528 --> 33:51.821
I'm fine.

33:51.863 --> 33:55.408
You, young lady,
are drunk.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.659
You're boring.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.953
And so are all
your stupid friends.

33:58.995 --> 34:01.748
Andrea, it's time
for you to go home.

34:01.789 --> 34:02.999
Juliet's turning in
for the night.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.792
Right now.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.005
[knocking on door]

34:10.923 --> 34:11.966
Hey.

34:15.344 --> 34:17.513
Your dad told me
what happened.

34:17.555 --> 34:21.350
I know I ruined
your party.

34:21.392 --> 34:24.771
I get it, I'm
a total screw-up.

34:24.812 --> 34:26.564
Juliet, I don't care
about the party.

34:26.606 --> 34:29.358
[sniffles]

34:29.400 --> 34:31.110
You know, I've ruined
my fair share of parties

34:31.152 --> 34:32.945
drinking too much.

34:32.987 --> 34:35.573
True story.

34:35.615 --> 34:38.785
But usually when I did it,
there was a reason.

34:38.826 --> 34:42.997
Juliet, I know
something's going on.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.916
Please, try
and talk to me.

34:48.544 --> 34:50.755
The other day...

34:50.797 --> 34:52.590
when I mentioned
Mr. Carpenter...

35:00.139 --> 35:03.518
Did something happen
between you two?

35:09.482 --> 35:11.150
[talking indistinctly]

35:14.612 --> 35:16.697
Carpenter.

35:16.739 --> 35:18.825
[grunts]

35:23.788 --> 35:25.540
What the hell is your problem?

35:25.581 --> 35:27.708
-Get out of my house.
-What's going on?

35:27.750 --> 35:30.503
If you come near my
stepdaughter again,
I will kill you!

35:30.545 --> 35:33.047
Juliet, what is
she talking about?

35:33.089 --> 35:36.342
Get out, now!

35:36.384 --> 35:37.552
WOMAN: What?

35:37.593 --> 35:40.012
[guests murmuring]

35:42.098 --> 35:43.808
What the hell's going on?

36:02.702 --> 36:05.121
Oh, God.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.666
I don't want to talk
about it.

36:08.708 --> 36:09.709
Juliet...

36:09.750 --> 36:10.835
Don't even.

36:15.673 --> 36:21.053
Why did you do that
in front of all
those people?

36:21.095 --> 36:22.638
All I wanted

36:22.680 --> 36:24.515
was to forget
about what happened,

36:24.557 --> 36:27.101
and now the whole
world knows.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.520
I am so sorry.

36:29.562 --> 36:31.105
I wasn't thinking.

36:31.147 --> 36:32.648
I was just so angry
I couldn't see straight.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.941
No kidding.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.361
Just get out.

36:47.705 --> 36:50.458
Daddy, please.

36:50.499 --> 36:51.667
Leave me alone.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.653

37:18.694 --> 37:20.988

37:23.491 --> 37:24.700

37:24.742 --> 37:26.285
Uh, no, actually.

37:26.327 --> 37:29.288
I just wanted to
ask you a couple questions.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.123
Great.
I love questions.

37:31.165 --> 37:33.751
Way more than tips.

37:33.793 --> 37:36.212
I'm investigating
this man--John Delario.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.755
He also goes
by Charlie Young.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.924
I know he was in
the area in September,

37:39.966 --> 37:42.009
but what I need to know
is if anyone saw him with her.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.719
Name's Bridget Kelly.

37:45.471 --> 37:47.056
They were in here once.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.350
But not
in September. May.

37:49.392 --> 37:52.645
That can't be right.
Bridget was in Wyoming in May.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.605
Okay, then.

37:54.647 --> 37:55.856
You sure it was May?

37:55.898 --> 37:57.441
I'm positive.
It was on my birthday.

37:57.483 --> 38:00.278
I was trying to
get out early,
but she was a bitch.

38:00.319 --> 38:01.612
Waved me down every
two seconds

38:01.654 --> 38:03.781
and then stiffed me
on the tip.

38:03.823 --> 38:04.865
Remember anything else?

38:04.907 --> 38:06.242
What they talked
about, maybe?

38:06.284 --> 38:07.410
The guy said
her name once,

38:07.451 --> 38:08.744
and she shut him
down quick.

38:08.786 --> 38:10.162
He called her
something weird.

38:10.204 --> 38:11.289
I never heard it before.

38:13.624 --> 38:14.750
He call her Siobhan?

38:14.792 --> 38:16.335
That's it.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.586
What kind of a name
is that?

38:17.628 --> 38:18.713
MAN:
Excuse me, miss?

38:23.342 --> 38:25.970
John Delario...

38:26.012 --> 38:28.264
what the hell were you doing
with Siobhan Martin?

38:32.226 --> 38:34.145
[typing]

38:49.160 --> 38:50.703
[elevator dings]

38:56.876 --> 38:58.544
How'd it go
at the police station?

38:58.586 --> 39:01.380
Can I talk about it later?

39:01.422 --> 39:03.758
I need to speak
with Juliet.

39:03.799 --> 39:06.218
She's still
in her room.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.304
She won't come out.

39:08.346 --> 39:12.391
But I was able to slip her
a tray of food, so...

39:12.433 --> 39:14.185
that was a start.

39:16.437 --> 39:18.314
Andrew...

39:18.356 --> 39:22.276
I'm really sorry about
decking Carpenter.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.861
I just...

39:23.903 --> 39:26.447
felt this need
to protect Juliet.

39:26.489 --> 39:29.408
Like a mother would.

39:29.450 --> 39:32.536
I'm not angry
at you, Siobhan.

39:32.578 --> 39:34.789
I'm the one who failed her.

39:34.830 --> 39:36.082
I should've seen
what was going on.

39:36.123 --> 39:38.626
Wait, no, she did
everything she could

39:38.667 --> 39:40.378
to keep you
from finding out.

39:40.419 --> 39:41.462
But you knew.

39:41.504 --> 39:42.713
And you tried to tell me.

39:42.755 --> 39:45.049
I knew that
something was off,

39:45.091 --> 39:46.509
that was it.

39:46.550 --> 39:47.885
It didn't stop me
from telling everyone

39:47.927 --> 39:49.804
how great she was doing
at her new school.

39:49.845 --> 39:53.516
We can't sit here
and beat ourselves up.

39:53.557 --> 39:55.559
I have done too much
of that in my life.

39:55.601 --> 39:58.813
It doesn't get you
anywhere.

39:58.854 --> 40:00.689
We'll get through this

40:00.731 --> 40:03.234
as a family.

40:03.275 --> 40:04.985
I promise.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.833
What are you doing here?

40:18.874 --> 40:21.168
Annafried let me in.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.379
She took the boys
out for dessert.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.089
Yeah, I know that.

40:25.131 --> 40:29.427
I-I know you're
angry at me.

40:29.468 --> 40:31.595
I-I've been acting
like a different person,

40:31.637 --> 40:32.888
and it doesn't
make sense.

40:32.930 --> 40:35.015
Get out.

40:35.057 --> 40:37.726
No.
Please, hear me out.

40:41.814 --> 40:44.442
I'm sorry
for yesterday.

40:44.483 --> 40:50.239
And the day before
and the last few months.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.616
And Gemma.

40:52.658 --> 40:56.412
Henry, if I could
change any of it,
take it back, I would.

40:56.454 --> 41:00.374
I miss you so much.

41:00.416 --> 41:02.001
That's funny.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.753
Because yesterday you wanted
nothing to do with me.

41:04.795 --> 41:07.298
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

41:07.339 --> 41:10.176
But I'm going to
fix it, I promise.

41:10.217 --> 41:11.510
Fix what, Siobhan?

41:11.552 --> 41:13.471
You are in charge.

41:13.512 --> 41:15.139
You want me? Here I am.

41:15.181 --> 41:17.183
You want to just live happily
ever after with Andrew,

41:17.224 --> 41:18.476
walk away.

41:18.517 --> 41:20.311
I can't!

41:20.352 --> 41:21.437
Henry, I love you.

41:21.479 --> 41:24.148
All right, fine, fine.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.816
Let's say that
that's the truth.

41:25.858 --> 41:28.527
All right?
That you really love me.

41:28.569 --> 41:31.030
Then I want to know
one thing:

41:31.071 --> 41:33.032
who was the person
at the party yesterday?

41:33.073 --> 41:34.742
Because it's not
the same person

41:34.783 --> 41:37.786
who's standing here
in front of me right now.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.538
Tell me.

41:39.580 --> 41:42.208
Who the hell are you?
