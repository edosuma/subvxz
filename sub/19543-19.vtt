00:02.544 --> 00:05.627
Benefiting from Mister Popo's advice,

00:05.714 --> 00:09.798
the gang obtains Kami-sama's spaceship.

00:09.885 --> 00:13.969
Believing that there must surely
be Dragon Balls out there...

00:16.015 --> 00:19.429
...Bulma, Kuririn, and Gohan

00:19.520 --> 00:23.889
have blasted off into space for Planet Namek.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.898
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

00:30.989 --> 00:34.072
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

00:34.159 --> 00:38.198
The Genki Dama bursts away

00:38.288 --> 00:41.621
Go Go Let's do it

00:42.835 --> 00:48.626
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

00:48.716 --> 00:54.586
I won't hold back, just you watch

00:54.680 --> 01:00.550
l'll protect you with my life

01:00.644 --> 01:06.731
Turn your courage to love into strength

01:06.817 --> 01:12.733
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

01:12.823 --> 01:19.991
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

01:21.331 --> 01:24.198
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:24.293 --> 01:27.501
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

01:27.588 --> 01:33.128
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

01:33.218 --> 01:36.085
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:36.180 --> 01:39.343
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

01:39.433 --> 01:46.475
Your soul already knows the answer

01:46.565 --> 01:50.183
Dragon Soul!

01:52.821 --> 01:59.067
"A Powerful New Foe!
The Emperor of the Universe, Freeza. "

02:23.060 --> 02:25.972
Ugh, I am bored to death.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.189
Good grief, this is only the seventh day.

02:32.861 --> 02:34.647
There are still twenty-some more days to go.

02:34.738 --> 02:38.276
I should have built a
hibernation device or something.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.865
Are you guys doing your image training again?

02:43.956 --> 02:46.743
That's nice for you. You can pass the time.

03:38.343 --> 03:42.302
Whew, not bad! You sure are strong.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.722
After all, you've inherited Goku's blood,
and had Piccolo train you.

03:45.809 --> 03:49.301
Still, I'm surprised at how many
techniques you have, Kuririn-san.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.897
Say...

03:50.981 --> 03:53.893
...it's up to you whether
you train inside your heads,

03:53.984 --> 03:55.849
but the room is starting to get pretty messy,

03:55.944 --> 03:57.855
so would you mind tidying it up?

03:57.946 --> 03:59.607
There is a lady present.

03:59.698 --> 04:02.565
But Bulma-san, you're the
one who made that mess.

04:02.659 --> 04:06.243
We've cleaned up our own stuff.

04:06.330 --> 04:10.539
I am busy. I have a lot of things
I have to think about, too.

04:10.626 --> 04:14.414
You guys are just riding along,
so that's fine for you.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.041
A moment ago, you said you were bored.

04:17.132 --> 04:21.922
You hush. | wish you could
be nicer to a delicate lady.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.759
Ah, I'm so busy, I'm so busy...

04:26.850 --> 04:30.342
If she's such a lady, I wish she wouldn't
parade around in her underwear.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.933
Say...

04:38.028 --> 04:40.986
So anyway, I've been
wondering about this for a while,

04:41.073 --> 04:45.362
but when that Saiyan Vegeta fled,
where did he flee to?

04:46.745 --> 04:47.985
Where, you ask?

04:48.080 --> 04:52.949
I mean, the Saiyan's world has
been gone for a long time, right?

04:53.043 --> 04:57.082
Oh, yeah. In any event, he had
taken some serious damage,

04:57.172 --> 04:59.379
so I'd think it would be
somewhere with a civilization.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.627
Do you suppose there's anyplace like that?

05:03.178 --> 05:07.012
That brother of Son-kun's said
something earlier, remember?

05:07.099 --> 05:09.431
"We exterminate the people who live on planets

05:09.518 --> 05:14.012
that have good environments,
and then sell them to aliens."

05:14.106 --> 05:16.142
I wonder if Vegeta went to
one of those alien folks,

05:16.233 --> 05:18.474
and is having them treat him.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.105
If so, then whenever he comes to Earth again

05:21.196 --> 05:24.233
would depend on where that planet is.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.236
If it's far away, that will buy us some time.

05:28.537 --> 05:29.617
I have to say,

05:29.705 --> 05:33.573
Earth has attracted the attention
of one heck of a bad guy.

05:43.051 --> 05:46.009
T-To think that something like this would happen...

05:48.473 --> 05:53.433
It has been 18 days since Vegeta left Earth.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.934
All right, here!

06:04.448 --> 06:06.234
Something's coming!

06:06.324 --> 06:07.359
Is it Freeza-sama?

06:07.451 --> 06:10.614
It couldn't be. He just barely departed.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.491
It's a round pod. That's a combatant.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.494
The signal belongs to Vegeta-sama!

06:16.585 --> 06:19.418
That's strange. We've received
no word that he was returning.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.880
Could something have happened?

06:20.964 --> 06:22.829
Hey this is the flight control room!

06:22.924 --> 06:26.087
Vegeta-sama is about to arrive!
Fall out to greet him at once!

06:30.891 --> 06:31.971
He's here!

06:32.059 --> 06:35.096
It's just one craft, all right! Where is Nappa-san?

06:46.573 --> 06:49.565
|-|s something the matter? He's not coming out.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.241
Hey, his life sign readings are awfully low.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.910
What?

06:55.624 --> 06:57.740
He's using his life support equipment!

06:57.834 --> 07:00.871
This is bad! Hurry and carry
him to the treatment room!

07:20.148 --> 07:21.684
There.

07:32.744 --> 07:36.362
You are healed. You may open your eyes.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.633
Unfortunately, I was unable to regrow your tail.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.462
No matter. It will grow back in due time.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.189
Vegeta-sama, as mighty as you are,

08:12.284 --> 08:14.400
you were put to quite a bit
of trouble, weren't you?

08:14.494 --> 08:18.078
If this superstrong rubber
protector was left in tatters,

08:18.165 --> 08:21.032
you were lucky to return to us in one piece.

08:21.126 --> 08:24.334
It would take quite a bit
for this to end up like this.

08:24.421 --> 08:28.664
What in the world happened
on this planet Earth?

08:36.808 --> 08:38.469
ls Freeza-sama around?

08:38.559 --> 08:41.142
N-No, he has departed.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.561
He's already tired of this planet, is he?

08:43.648 --> 08:46.264
U-Um, Kewie-sama said that...

08:46.359 --> 08:49.226
...once your treatment was completed,
he needed to speak to you,

08:49.321 --> 08:51.562
and to report to the Training Room.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.363
Hmph, you tell him that I said, unfortunately,

08:54.451 --> 08:56.988
I don't have anything to talk to him about.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.569
B-But...

09:03.585 --> 09:07.453
Vegeta-sama, um, you forgot your Scouter.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.880
I don't need it. You can have it.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.509
I'll head for Earth first thing in the morning.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.592
This time, I'll blow them to smithereens for sure.

09:21.686 --> 09:25.554
No, before that, I'll go to Planet Namek...

09:25.649 --> 09:30.894
Yo, Vegeta! Word is you got your butt kicked.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.989
I hear Raditz and Nappa are dead, too.

09:36.076 --> 09:40.536
Who was it that caused the supposedly
invincible Saiyans such agony?

09:40.622 --> 09:45.161
Get lost, Kewie. I don't have time
to listen to your worthless drivel.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.867
Now, just listen.

09:46.962 --> 09:52.798
Freeza-sama is upset with you,
going off by yourselves like that.

09:52.884 --> 09:55.500
If he's not here, he can't gripe about it.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.344
Now,

09:58.431 --> 10:01.468
remove that filthy hand of yours.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.726
Still, Freeza-sama is a magnanimous person.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.429
He seems willing to forgive you,

10:07.524 --> 10:10.607
since you discovered
something quite sensational.

10:10.694 --> 10:11.604
What?

10:11.695 --> 10:16.064
He was thrilled that he might be
able to gain eternal life and youth.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.900
Say what?! Then, you mean
Freeza-sama departed for...

10:19.995 --> 10:22.236
Hmph, Planet Namek.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.743
Damn! He was listening in to what
we were saying on the Scouters?!

10:25.834 --> 10:29.418
I have to beat him to it, or I'll be
that bastard's puppet forever!

10:29.504 --> 10:34.498
You apparently wanted to use
the Dragon Balls to get eternal life,

10:34.592 --> 10:36.093
but you'll have to give up on that now.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.758
Once Freeza-sama has his wish granted,

10:37.846 --> 10:42.180
he plans to exterminate the Namekians.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.757
That bastard!

10:43.852 --> 10:45.763
Hey, Vegeta!

10:47.814 --> 10:50.055
V-Vegeta-sama!

10:50.150 --> 10:51.606
Give me that!

10:51.693 --> 10:54.309
I'm going to need it after all!

10:59.200 --> 11:01.111
Vegeta!

11:04.581 --> 11:08.073
I won't let you do it! They belong to me!

11:29.564 --> 11:31.429
Not again.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.319
Four more.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.943
Geez, Son-san, you can't do this.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.821
Miss Nurse, I'm all right now.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.494
Goku, you see, is immortal.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.708
Oh, did I just do something?

11:51.795 --> 11:54.582
It must be my age. Lately,
my mind has been slipping...

11:54.672 --> 11:56.708
Oh, for the love of...

11:56.800 --> 11:59.542
These sponge cakes are delicious.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.768
Ahem!

12:10.855 --> 12:12.561
Doctor!

12:12.649 --> 12:15.766
How many times must I tell you?

12:17.237 --> 12:20.525
If you keep this up, you'll never be discharged.

12:20.615 --> 12:23.357
But as you can see, I'm...

12:23.451 --> 12:28.445
I'm sure that hurts. You have been
quite seriously injured, after all.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.121
Now get back to bed.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.290
S-Sorry.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.868
Come on, Grandpa Glad-hands, help him up.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.295
G-Grandpa Glad-hands?

12:37.382 --> 12:39.543
Grandpa Glad-hands, am I?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.796
My word...

12:45.515 --> 12:47.847
"Grandpa Glad-hands."

12:49.394 --> 12:51.976
Where is his wife, who was looking after him?

12:52.063 --> 12:56.397
Oh, she must have gone up to the
roof again, to look up into the sky.

13:06.369 --> 13:09.782
I wonder if Gohan-chan is doin' okay.

13:09.873 --> 13:13.115
And after all my insistin' that
he send me a letter every day,

13:13.209 --> 13:16.292
I haven't gotten a single one.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.337
Come back to me soon, safe and sound.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.299
34 days after leaving Earth,

13:26.389 --> 13:32.180
Bulma and the others at last reach
their destination of Planet Namek.

13:32.270 --> 13:35.353
We made it! There it is!

13:35.440 --> 13:37.522
Wow! It sure is pretty!

13:37.609 --> 13:40.271
That world is Planet Namek, huh?

13:40.361 --> 13:41.487
No doubt about it!

13:41.571 --> 13:45.189
The computer vouches that this
is the bona fide Planet Namek!

13:45.283 --> 13:47.649
We got here just about right
on schedule, didn't we?

13:47.744 --> 13:50.531
That's Kami-sama's spaceship for you!

13:50.622 --> 13:52.658
That was smooth sailing, all right!

13:52.749 --> 13:56.708
Sure was! Now, sit down and fasten
your seatbelts so we can land.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.409
There's going to be a pretty hard jolt.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.961
Right!

14:03.301 --> 14:06.509
Begin landing procedures
for any suitable location.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.870
We made it! We landed on Planet Namek!

14:37.961 --> 14:39.952
We're here!

14:43.925 --> 14:46.667
Hang on. I'm going to check the
atmospheric components now.

14:46.761 --> 14:50.424
I made sure to install some
sensors. Aren't I prepared?

14:50.515 --> 14:53.302
We'll be lucky if there's a
certain amount of oxygen.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.179
I did prepare some atmospheric masks,

14:55.270 --> 14:58.603
but our time would be limited,
and I don't know how much help--

15:07.365 --> 15:13.201
This is a lot like the place
where Piccolo-san trained me.

15:15.039 --> 15:18.782
Yeah, that place where we
fought the Saiyans first, right?

15:18.876 --> 15:22.915
I guess he'd instinctively feel more
at ease in a place like his home.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.961
Piccolo-san...

15:27.051 --> 15:30.589
You guys don't have the least bit
of common sense, do you?!

15:30.680 --> 15:33.672
How can you just stroll on out here?!

15:33.766 --> 15:36.178
You're as scary as ever...

15:36.269 --> 15:40.603
For crying out loud. Well, as long
as there are Dragon Balls here...

15:40.690 --> 15:42.226
Please!

15:43.484 --> 15:45.816
Look! I'm reading them!

15:48.448 --> 15:51.656
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

15:51.743 --> 15:55.986
K-Kuririn-san, I feel some strong Ki over there.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.410
Ki?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.411
You're right.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.538
I'm feeling a lot of them.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.417
Yeah. And what's more,
they're all really powerful Ki.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.043
W-What does that mean?

16:08.134 --> 16:09.920
Oh, you guys. What are you talking about?

16:10.011 --> 16:11.842
Those are Namekians.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.011
As strong as Kami-sama and Piccolo were,

16:14.098 --> 16:16.214
it's not at all surprising
that the Namekians at home

16:16.309 --> 16:18.015
would have powerful Ki, too.

16:18.102 --> 16:21.060
——But...
--These Ki feel a little bit evil, don't they?

16:21.147 --> 16:22.762
It's all right, I tell you.

16:22.857 --> 16:27.647
Kaio-sama said that Namekians
are peaceful by nature, didn't he?

16:27.737 --> 16:29.602
Over in that direction,

16:29.697 --> 16:31.983
there are four Dragon Balls gathered together.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.691
Now, let's go and meet the Namekians!

16:34.786 --> 16:40.201
Yeah... You're right. They must be Namekians!

16:40.291 --> 16:42.498
I feel silly for being scared.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.844
Haven't we seen that before somewhere?

16:57.183 --> 16:59.094
It's a Saiyan spaceship!

16:59.185 --> 17:01.096
I knew it!

17:07.068 --> 17:10.481
--It can't be!
--Oh, no, for real? Why?!

17:10.570 --> 17:13.061
Gohan, mask your presence! We'll be detected!

17:13.156 --> 17:14.693
R-Right!

17:14.784 --> 17:18.242
I-It's Vegeta. It couldn't be anyone else.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.569
D-Damn it!

17:20.665 --> 17:23.247
He's already recovered from his injuries?

17:24.585 --> 17:28.578
Come to think of it, he knows
about the Dragon Balls, too.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.003
W-What do we do? It's hopeless now!

17:33.094 --> 17:37.212
All we can do is go back to Earth, right?
Am I right? Let's hurry back!

17:37.306 --> 17:40.924
If that guy gets his hands on
the Dragon Balls, it's all over.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.725
Bulma-san, please contact Earth,
tell them about this,

17:43.813 --> 17:45.804
and then return there by yourself.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.311
Gohan and I will stay here,
and try to collect the Dragon Balls.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.357
But...

17:50.445 --> 17:54.438
It's all right. We'll have the Dragon Radar.

17:54.532 --> 17:56.693
--Right, Gohan?
--Right!

17:56.784 --> 17:58.069
Okay.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.321
Once I get back to Earth,

17:59.412 --> 18:02.074
I'll bring Son-kun aboard, and come right back.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.872
The round trip will take a little over two months.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.496
Sit tight, okay?

18:07.587 --> 18:10.420
It'll be fine! Two months will go by like that!

18:10.506 --> 18:13.122
It's just 60 days! That's only 1,440 hours,

18:13.217 --> 18:16.459
86,400 minutes, or 5,184,000 seconds!

18:16.554 --> 18:18.419
Right?

18:18.514 --> 18:22.006
Right, a little over two months.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.237
Freeza, you bastard.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.990
You're trying to grab them away
from me, but I won't let you.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.119
I should be able to handle
everyone besides Freeza,

18:47.210 --> 18:50.122
but I don't stand a chance fighting him head-on.

18:50.213 --> 18:53.751
I have to steal the Dragon Balls
and gain eternal life, no matter what.

18:53.841 --> 18:57.425
Tch! To think that I would wind
up using a Scouter again...

19:01.891 --> 19:03.506
This way, huh?

19:06.938 --> 19:10.226
He brought Zarbon and Dodoria with him.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.981
W-What did you say?!

19:16.072 --> 19:18.028
A-And then?

19:19.826 --> 19:22.693
Yeah. So tell Son-kun and the others.

19:22.787 --> 19:26.905
Do you hear me? Just don't
tell Chichi-san. Got it?

19:26.999 --> 19:30.992
Yeah... Yeah... Like I said...

19:32.088 --> 19:35.706
No! It's not like that! Sheesh!

19:35.800 --> 19:39.543
Right! You got it? I'm counting on you. Bye, now.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.673
For Pete's sake...

19:41.764 --> 19:44.130
What's the matter, you two?

19:49.480 --> 19:51.812
Huh? What?

19:59.198 --> 20:03.362
W-W-Why is that thing coming here again?!

20:03.452 --> 20:07.365
T-That's what I'd like to know.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.683
I found it, Freeza-sama.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.267
Oh, good, good.

20:37.361 --> 20:40.945
Now there are three of them left.

20:54.879 --> 20:59.498
At last, the evil mastermind Freeza appears.

21:01.177 --> 21:06.843
Vegeta is also back in action,
and burning with ambition.

21:06.933 --> 21:11.427
The trio unexpectedly find themselves in a crisis.

21:14.065 --> 21:18.308
This is bad. This is definitely bad.

21:18.402 --> 21:23.066
Will Gohan and the others be
able to gather the Dragon Balls

21:23.157 --> 21:26.866
without any mishap?

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Fly away into the boundless skies

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
and zip away to wherever we want

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Being a daredevil is the best

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
You were born

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Go at it full power

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Hope is my weapon,

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
so believe in the future

22:34.437 --> 22:36.177
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:36.272 --> 22:38.228
Someone stronger than Vegeta?

22:38.315 --> 22:40.772
Not even I have a chance of beating Freeza.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.146
First, I'll take care of the minnows!

22:43.237 --> 22:46.104
I have to train like crazy, and get much stronger

22:46.198 --> 22:47.574
before I arrive at Planet Namek.

22:47.658 --> 22:50.866
Hmph, I won't let anyone have the Dragon Balls!

22:50.953 --> 22:52.693
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:52.788 --> 22:56.030
"Rebellion Against Freeza!
Vegeta's Burning Ambition. ”

22:56.125 --> 22:59.709
The home-grown Dragon Balls sure are big, huh?

23:00.305 --> 23:06.544
