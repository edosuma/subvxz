00:50.043 --> 00:51.751
On your marks,

00:51.835 --> 00:52.918
get set,

00:53.626 --> 00:54.668
go!

00:57.876 --> 01:00.001
Come on! Faster!

01:00.085 --> 01:04.209
Faster! Wolf Gang, you can do it.
Come on!

01:24.335 --> 01:25.251
<i>Wolf Gang!</i>

01:25.335 --> 01:28.126
Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang!
Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang!

01:37.043 --> 01:41.001
Oh, he face-planted the floor!

01:41.418 --> 01:44.251
- Get Femi. Get him.
- No, stop!

01:47.293 --> 01:48.376
Get him.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.835
- Push him.
- Get down!

01:58.376 --> 02:00.501
Three, two, one...

02:06.585 --> 02:09.001
<i>Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang!</i>

02:09.085 --> 02:10.918
<i>One, two, three!</i>

02:11.001 --> 02:12.001
Wolf Gang!

03:03.960 --> 03:07.168
You're not gonna get any chocolate
until you eat your greens.

03:10.210 --> 03:12.085
I spoke to your mum today.

03:15.418 --> 03:17.751
She's definitely
coming to visit tomorrow.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.001
Why?

03:24.335 --> 03:26.335
To see you, obviously.

03:31.168 --> 03:34.585
I know it's been a while,
but she's super excited.

03:39.751 --> 03:41.335
Can I go to my room?

03:41.418 --> 03:42.626
Come here.

03:47.751 --> 03:50.585
She's not coming to take you away.

03:53.126 --> 03:54.668
Do you promise?

04:01.043 --> 04:02.543
Here you are.

04:04.793 --> 04:07.126
And tomorrow,
you eat all your greens, right?

05:06.501 --> 05:07.751
Go on, Nathan.

05:07.835 --> 05:09.918
Go on, Nathan. Go on, Nathan!

05:10.126 --> 05:11.460
- Hold him there, Nathan.
- Go on, Femi.

05:11.543 --> 05:14.251
Femi, wriggle out of it.
You've got to wriggle out of it.

05:14.418 --> 05:16.626
Nathan, get out of there, Nathan.

05:16.835 --> 05:18.335
- Get out of there, Nathan.
- Get off!

05:18.418 --> 05:20.751
- Come on, Femi, hold him! One!
- Pull him off!

05:20.835 --> 05:22.793
- Come on, Nathan. Get out of it.
- Two!

05:22.876 --> 05:25.251
- Get out of it, Nathan.
- Three!

05:25.335 --> 05:26.585
He's gone.

05:46.751 --> 05:50.876
My boy, hm? Come <i>.</i>

05:50.960 --> 05:53.876
Ah! It's been too long.

05:57.626 --> 05:59.460
You've grown, huh?

05:59.543 --> 06:04.043
I think he probably just needs to get
cleaned up and have some food.

06:04.126 --> 06:05.543
Yeah.

06:05.668 --> 06:06.960
OK.

06:09.960 --> 06:13.001
You've nothing to blame yourself over.
He's a good boy.

06:13.543 --> 06:15.710
Well, you've done a good job.

06:17.668 --> 06:19.501
I want to take him back.

06:26.918 --> 06:30.668
- Are you gonna tell him that?
- We both will.

06:31.710 --> 06:33.043
No.

06:33.668 --> 06:36.626
I'll tell him. I just...

06:38.626 --> 06:42.501
- Just give me some time <i>.</i>
- OK.

07:17.501 --> 07:18.918
Can I be excused?

07:20.126 --> 07:22.001
Finish your food first.

08:20.085 --> 08:21.293
Go on, then!

08:24.751 --> 08:26.626
Go on. Come at me, then.
Come at it, Rick.

08:26.710 --> 08:30.168
- Go on, boys!
- Oh, no. This is not good.

08:30.251 --> 08:32.376
- Come on, now!
- Come on!

08:32.460 --> 08:34.001
Oh, come on.

08:36.501 --> 08:38.960
- Yes!
- What a goal!

08:52.335 --> 08:53.626
<i>You know I love you.</i>

08:56.418 --> 08:58.418
- Hmm-hm.
- Hmm-hm.

08:59.543 --> 09:01.543
Your mother loves you too.

09:04.751 --> 09:06.293
Do you know that?

09:12.793 --> 09:16.168
She's been trying to sort a place
for the both of you.

09:19.543 --> 09:21.335
She's ready now.

09:23.626 --> 09:25.501
She's ready to take you back.

09:28.376 --> 09:30.460
Are you just gonna let her take me?

09:32.543 --> 09:34.043
I know it's hard.

09:36.251 --> 09:38.210
You promised.

09:39.626 --> 09:40.960
She's your mother.

09:41.043 --> 09:42.085
No.

09:42.168 --> 09:44.710
Femi. Femi!

11:47.835 --> 11:49.835
Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang!

11:49.918 --> 11:52.876
Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang!

11:52.960 --> 11:54.335
Wolf Gang!

11:59.543 --> 12:01.126
Olufemi.

12:04.835 --> 12:07.751
Oh. This is my friend, Bimpe.

12:07.835 --> 12:10.793
She has been a real blessing
in helping me get set up in London.

12:11.001 --> 12:13.585
- Good afternoon.
- This is Mary.

12:13.668 --> 12:17.626
And my boy, Olufemi.
Remember Auntie Bimpe?

12:21.126 --> 12:24.376
- Fine boy.
- Ah, let me help you with this.

12:25.876 --> 12:27.668
I think that's everything.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.085
We'll wait in the car.

12:42.085 --> 12:44.876
You remember how proud I am of you.

12:47.126 --> 12:48.960
And I'm always here.

12:49.460 --> 12:50.418
Hmm-hm?

13:05.001 --> 13:06.543
All in?

13:57.793 --> 13:59.085
We're almost there.

14:31.626 --> 14:34.126
Olufemi, come on, take your bag.

14:59.668 --> 15:01.876
Careful. There's pee there.

15:06.418 --> 15:08.168
Welcome home.

15:09.085 --> 15:11.085
That one is yours.

15:14.085 --> 15:17.710
There's so much we can do here
now that you're home.

15:17.793 --> 15:22.710
We can paint it or...
or even get wallpaper.

15:24.751 --> 15:26.418
Are you hungry?

15:26.918 --> 15:29.335
I made stew this morning
and we have rice.

15:29.418 --> 15:31.210
Or even a little plantain.

15:36.085 --> 15:40.126
You must be tired.
I'll leave you to get ready for bed.

15:42.210 --> 15:44.626
My room is just downstairs,
if you need anything.

15:44.710 --> 15:47.293
And so is the bathroom.

15:48.376 --> 15:52.126
Goodnight... Olufemi.

17:27.292 --> 17:28.585
Here.

17:36.251 --> 17:37.668
But you've had this before.

17:37.751 --> 17:40.710
I made it for you that time
when I visited and you liked it.

17:42.293 --> 17:44.960
- Do you have any cereal?
- No.

17:45.835 --> 17:48.335
OK. So I'll finish work at 5pm

17:48.418 --> 17:50.918
and then I start
another cleaning job straight after.

17:51.001 --> 17:54.710
<i>So you'll be here by yourself
most of the time before you start school.</i>

17:54.793 --> 17:58.001
<i>But that doesn't mean you should just
be sitting here watching television.</i>

17:58.085 --> 18:00.876
<i>You're not a lazy boy. So I expect you</i>

18:00.960 --> 18:02.710
<i>to take care of the house.</i>

18:02.793 --> 18:06.585
<i>I need you to sweep,
wash your clothes, wash the plates</i>

18:06.668 --> 18:09.626
<i>and please make up your bed.</i>

18:16.085 --> 18:20.043
What are you...? No, you're just...
you're just putting dust everywhere.

18:20.126 --> 18:22.751
You do it in the direction outside,
towards outside.

18:23.918 --> 18:26.043
And you use these muscles
in your arms here,

18:26.126 --> 18:29.626
otherwise you won't move anything.
Here. Go.

18:32.335 --> 18:36.751
Please, please. Don't go out anywhere
until I can show you around, OK?

19:18.793 --> 19:21.418
This pepper is very hot.

19:31.668 --> 19:33.085
Olufemi.

19:36.126 --> 19:37.626
Olufemi.

19:41.335 --> 19:42.793
What are you doing?

19:46.960 --> 19:50.751
Look at this place. I told you what to do.
You haven't done anything.

19:50.960 --> 19:54.001
- I said I'll do it later.
- I did not raise you to be rude.

19:54.376 --> 19:55.751
You didn't raise me.

19:58.126 --> 20:02.001
Are you... Are you crazy?
Who are you talking to like that?

20:03.210 --> 20:07.168
Never in your life talk
to me like that again!

20:08.543 --> 20:09.918
Stand up!

20:13.751 --> 20:17.251
- Nan.
<i>- How are you, love?</i>

20:19.668 --> 20:21.168
I miss you.

20:21.251 --> 20:23.793
Hold your ears with your hands,
like this.

20:23.876 --> 20:26.585
Bend and straight.

20:26.668 --> 20:31.585
And bend and straight.
Keep doing that. Quick.

20:32.001 --> 20:34.043
If you move from that place
before I tell you,

20:34.126 --> 20:36.501
I will come back here
and I will beat you again.

20:37.418 --> 20:39.460
- Thank you.
- No worries.

20:41.335 --> 20:44.585
There you go. Have a nice day.

20:45.335 --> 20:47.751
<i>I miss you too.
How are you finding everything?</i>

20:50.335 --> 20:51.751
I'm OK.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.668
<i>- Are you sure, love?</i>
- Yeah.

21:11.001 --> 21:14.418
<i>- Are you settling in OK?
- Yeah.</i>

21:19.793 --> 21:21.335
I love you, Nan.

21:39.710 --> 21:41.710
Are you sure you don't
want me to take you?

21:42.751 --> 21:44.210
I'm sure.

21:47.585 --> 21:50.668
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

21:50.751 --> 21:53.460
I want to pray so your first day
is a success.

22:00.210 --> 22:03.376
Bless Femi as he embarks
on his first day at school.

22:03.460 --> 22:05.626
Send angels to encamp around him.

22:05.710 --> 22:08.751
Teach him to be the head
and not the tail.

22:08.835 --> 22:13.793
So that he may have success
all the days of his life.

22:13.876 --> 22:17.085
In Jesus's name we have prayed.

22:18.501 --> 22:20.835
- Amen.
- Amen.

22:23.585 --> 22:24.835
Mary's a Christian.

22:24.918 --> 22:27.876
Did she not teach you how to pray
or take you to church?

22:31.085 --> 22:33.168
There's so much I want to show you.

22:33.460 --> 22:35.710
One of these days,
I'm going to take you back home.

22:35.793 --> 22:38.001
We're a very spiritual family.

22:38.085 --> 22:42.960
Your name Olufemi means "God loves me",
so you can't be godless.

22:43.043 --> 22:44.501
And this isn't just about church.

22:44.585 --> 22:47.626
We have our own religion,
practised by our family for generations.

22:47.710 --> 22:49.960
So it's important that...

22:51.876 --> 22:52.835
What?

22:57.585 --> 22:59.710
But that's a story for another time.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.918
Be good.

23:47.335 --> 23:49.960
Cedric, sit down, please.

23:51.710 --> 23:54.460
Calm down. Thank you.

23:55.876 --> 24:00.376
OK. We have a new student
that I'd like to introduce you to.

24:00.460 --> 24:02.335
This is Olufemi.

24:02.418 --> 24:04.251
Femi.

24:04.335 --> 24:06.418
- Sorry?
- Femi.

24:06.876 --> 24:08.918
- In the register it says...
- Just Femi.

24:09.001 --> 24:10.960
- Femi.
- OK, thank you.

24:11.043 --> 24:12.460
- "Olufemi."
- Dean.

24:12.543 --> 24:15.043
I'm sure you'll all make him
feel welcome.

24:15.376 --> 24:17.501
Femi!

24:17.585 --> 24:19.710
Dean. That's somebody's name.

24:19.793 --> 24:22.251
How would you feel about somebody
making fun of your name?

24:22.335 --> 24:24.793
My name's not Olufemi. I'm all right.

24:24.876 --> 24:26.960
Yes, thank you, Dean.

24:28.501 --> 24:31.251
I want you all to introduce yourselves
throughout the day.

24:31.335 --> 24:35.293
OK? So find a moment to go over
and make sure that he knows your name

24:35.376 --> 24:37.460
and welcome him to the school.

24:53.668 --> 24:55.251
Nesrine.

24:56.585 --> 24:59.043
- Nesrine.
- Here, sir.

25:00.960 --> 25:03.293
- Tina.
- Here, sir.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.085
Leila.

25:05.710 --> 25:07.210
Lebechi.

25:07.876 --> 25:09.585
Has anyone seen Lebechi?

25:10.418 --> 25:13.376
And a new student today,
Olufemi Oluwale.

25:13.835 --> 25:14.918
Olufemi.

25:15.001 --> 25:17.376
- Just Femi.
- It says Olufemi on my register.

25:17.460 --> 25:20.710
- Just Femi.
- Sir, just Olufemi.

25:20.793 --> 25:23.668
- Quiet, Dean. Day?
- Here, sir.

25:23.751 --> 25:25.210
And Tess.

25:25.293 --> 25:27.751
Olufemi, what's going on with your trim?

25:28.251 --> 25:30.085
And what's going on
with your shoes as well?

25:30.168 --> 25:32.251
What's going on?

25:32.335 --> 25:35.001
Your hairline's looking kind of bent
as well, man.

25:35.085 --> 25:37.835
- Do you wanna get sent out?
- What you gonna do?

25:40.043 --> 25:42.793
Hey! That's enough.
Out the way! Out the way!

25:42.876 --> 25:45.626
- Fight! Fight!
- That's enough.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.251
That's enough. Out. Out.

25:48.335 --> 25:50.668
That's enough. Calm down.

26:06.210 --> 26:09.835
Do you know they want to suspend you?

26:11.085 --> 26:12.751
On your first day.

26:14.460 --> 26:16.543
What are you thinking, Femi?

26:17.251 --> 26:19.543
- He started it.
- I'm talking, you are talking.

26:19.626 --> 26:22.960
But he did though.

26:23.043 --> 26:26.501
I had to leave work to come and get you.
Do you pay my bills?

26:26.585 --> 26:29.085
Do you pay any bills in this house, eh?

26:29.168 --> 26:31.168
Do you pay any bills?

26:31.251 --> 26:32.626
Olufemi!

27:05.751 --> 27:08.168
Yeah, look, look.
It's in. It's in.

27:11.043 --> 27:12.460
Go on!

27:12.543 --> 27:15.293
What a goal! Come on.

27:17.460 --> 27:19.293
Free ball. Free ball.

27:19.626 --> 27:21.293
Ooh! And again!

27:21.668 --> 27:23.710
- Unlucky.
- Get me the ball.

27:25.210 --> 27:26.793
- Yes, to him?
- To him.

27:27.293 --> 27:28.418
Yes, to me!

27:31.293 --> 27:34.085
- Oh!
- Ooh, nice goal. Nice.

27:47.293 --> 27:49.501
- Nice to see you, yeah.
- Nice to see you, Femi.

27:50.293 --> 27:52.501
- See you later.
- Yeah.

30:08.293 --> 30:10.418
Hurry up! Hurry up! Quick.

30:13.293 --> 30:15.418
Dickhead <i>.</i>

30:24.460 --> 30:27.543
See the boss man's face?

30:30.376 --> 30:34.668
- What did you get?
- Man hit the jackpot. We've got...

30:35.043 --> 30:37.376
- Wine gums.
- Wine gums and that.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.293
Next thing, some liquorice.

30:39.376 --> 30:41.876
Look at this next flavour though.
Classic cheeseburger.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.418
- Them things are batty.
- Is it?

30:43.501 --> 30:46.710
Look. You think you've hit big,
but I've hit the jackpot so...

30:46.793 --> 30:48.085
- Yeah?
- Swear down?

30:48.168 --> 30:51.751
- Swear.
- What you saying? Come on then.

30:51.835 --> 30:53.793
Ooh... ah!

30:55.126 --> 30:56.543
Yo, is that it?

30:57.210 --> 31:00.543
- What, you don't care about dental hygiene?
- Oh, my days. Tayo, man.

31:00.626 --> 31:03.585
I can tell you man don't care about
dental hygiene but some of us do.

31:03.668 --> 31:05.835
Look at you, bruv. Look at your mouth!

31:05.918 --> 31:07.960
- Shut up.
- This is why I bought this. For you.

31:08.043 --> 31:09.668
What's this? A toothpick?

31:09.751 --> 31:12.793
- Yeah, it's a toothpick.
- Nah, cuz. You're an idiot.

31:12.876 --> 31:14.918
- Tayo, you're wack, bro.
- Hey, you too, bro.

31:15.001 --> 31:16.335
Fam, shut up, man.

31:19.168 --> 31:22.251
- Waste man, what's he on?
- It's both of you, fam.

31:22.376 --> 31:24.585
Chill. Are you going to Tamara's ting?

31:24.668 --> 31:29.043
- Yeah, bro. You man going?
- Nah.

31:29.668 --> 31:31.918
- Bring me, mang.
- No plus-ones, my brother.

31:32.001 --> 31:34.085
- She's ugly anyway, man.
- What do you mean, "no"?

31:34.168 --> 31:36.793
Yo, that's Mace.
Let's just keep walking. Chill.

31:43.085 --> 31:45.085
Oi, oi, Mace.

31:47.001 --> 31:48.460
Oi, come here.

31:49.210 --> 31:50.960
I said come here.

31:54.626 --> 31:59.543
Ooh, man like Fems, what you saying?
I like this little yout, you know.

31:59.626 --> 32:02.043
He was running tings in the school
with his little crew.

32:03.126 --> 32:05.626
- Yeah, something like that.
- Cool.

32:05.710 --> 32:07.751
Well, this little prick here's a snitch.

32:07.835 --> 32:10.501
And he's gonna squeal for us
like a pig on all fours, aren't you?

32:10.585 --> 32:15.085
And if you don't, my boy Femi is gonna
make sure the job gets done, aren't you?

32:15.835 --> 32:18.335
Yeah. Well, he's not squealing.

32:19.668 --> 32:21.210
Handle that.

32:31.376 --> 32:32.668
Do it.

32:34.210 --> 32:36.251
Get on all fours and squeal.

32:40.793 --> 32:42.251
Do it, Billy.

32:52.501 --> 32:54.585
Squeal.

32:56.293 --> 32:58.668
I wanna hear proper snorting.

33:12.043 --> 33:14.501
Louder.

33:17.168 --> 33:21.793
All right.
Get the fuck out of here. Hurry up.

33:27.293 --> 33:30.501
Oi, Femi. You got a phone?

33:45.876 --> 33:47.168
Here.

33:49.085 --> 33:51.543
You can't be a boss without a phone, innit?

33:53.751 --> 33:55.585
A'ight, see you later.

33:57.585 --> 34:00.168
- Cool. You lot get out of here then.
- Hurry up, bruv.

34:00.251 --> 34:01.751
Nah, maybe later.

34:02.585 --> 34:03.960
Man, just shut up.

34:04.335 --> 34:06.251
See you around, Femi.

35:27.001 --> 35:28.043
Hey, Femi.

35:30.335 --> 35:34.168
- How was school?
- Fine.

35:40.960 --> 35:45.418
Auntie Bimpe's having a small gathering
at her place tonight.

35:45.501 --> 35:46.543
Do you want to follow me?

35:47.043 --> 35:48.960
I already told you I'm busy.

35:49.043 --> 35:51.293
- Doing what?
- Stuff.

35:52.293 --> 35:56.168
What stuff is more important than
just spending some time together?

36:01.501 --> 36:04.293
Mary called. Again.

36:06.293 --> 36:08.376
I thought you said you was
going to call her back.

36:08.460 --> 36:09.710
- I will.
- When?

36:09.793 --> 36:11.418
Whenever I'm less busy, innit?

36:11.501 --> 36:15.001
You are here to focus
on your exams, huh?

36:15.210 --> 36:17.793
I don't want you running around
like all these other boys.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.626
Yes.

36:20.626 --> 36:21.793
Excuse me.

37:09.210 --> 37:10.960
Yo. What you listening to?

37:11.043 --> 37:13.543
Er... Tupac <i>. Hit 'Em Up.</i>

37:15.543 --> 37:17.376
Have you heard
the new Wiley ting, though?

37:17.460 --> 37:20.126
Yeah. It's not too bad.
They played it at that thing last night.

37:20.210 --> 37:23.251
- Look at this guy, man.
- Yo. What you guys saying?

37:23.335 --> 37:25.585
Chill. You're always jumping round, man.

37:25.668 --> 37:26.710
Why you so hyper?

37:26.793 --> 37:28.751
I dunno.
Man's got ADHD or something, innit?

37:29.335 --> 37:31.293
We're trying to get
respect out here.

37:31.376 --> 37:35.043
- You can't be acting like that.
- Smelly Tope. What you saying?

37:36.210 --> 37:39.876
Yo, yo, yo, yo. I'm talking to you.
Don't ignore me.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.126
Come here.

37:41.210 --> 37:43.376
Let me see this shit. What's this?

37:44.335 --> 37:48.251
- Blue horseshit.
- Tope. Don't let him do that.

37:48.335 --> 37:51.585
What's she gonna do?
What you gonna do, blick shit, huh?

37:51.668 --> 37:54.168
Yo, he said you a blick <i>.</i>

37:54.251 --> 37:56.168
What's blacker,
her shoes or her forehead?

37:56.251 --> 37:58.918
Oh, yo. What you thinking?

37:59.001 --> 38:01.751
Definitely her forehead, innit?

38:02.668 --> 38:04.626
- What, you gonna cry?
- Hold on, man. That's enough.

38:04.710 --> 38:07.001
No, hold on. Cry.
Just let the tears fall out.

38:07.085 --> 38:08.501
Femi!

38:09.501 --> 38:11.293
Next time, innit?

38:28.876 --> 38:30.376
Femi.

38:30.835 --> 38:32.293
Are you there?

38:33.543 --> 38:34.918
Yeah.

38:36.585 --> 38:40.460
Femi.
Why is it so dark in here?

38:42.793 --> 38:45.085
Just saving electricity, innit?

38:45.835 --> 38:49.126
- You're always complaining about it.
- What's wrong?

38:49.751 --> 38:51.251
Nothing.

38:54.626 --> 38:57.043
You never want to talk to me
about anything.

39:01.918 --> 39:06.751
OK. Well, at least you're home.
We can have dinner together for once.

39:07.418 --> 39:08.835
I have to go out.

39:10.126 --> 39:11.751
Where?

39:12.001 --> 39:13.710
- Study group.
- What study group?

39:13.793 --> 39:15.376
With my friends.

39:16.168 --> 39:19.835
I don't feel like we're living
in the same house. I come, you go...

39:19.918 --> 39:23.335
Look, I'm sorry you're lonely,
but it ain't my fault he's not here.

39:23.418 --> 39:24.835
Who?

39:26.085 --> 39:27.460
Whoever my dad is.

39:28.001 --> 39:30.543
- You don't know anything.
- I know he left.

39:31.793 --> 39:33.418
That's all I have to know.

39:34.918 --> 39:37.626
And one day, I'll leave too.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.293
Yo.

41:46.376 --> 41:50.293
Hey. Where you been?
What took you so long, bruv?

41:50.626 --> 41:53.751
Hurry up. Mace is waiting for you.

41:55.668 --> 41:57.501
In there, bruv. Go.

42:18.668 --> 42:21.460
My lieutenant. Come over here.

42:23.626 --> 42:25.043
Sit down.

42:35.668 --> 42:38.668
You see, when you're the boss,
you gotta look after the bottom line.

42:39.460 --> 42:41.335
Keep your mind focussed.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.626
Is your mind focussed right now?

42:48.085 --> 42:50.001
Is it focussed right now?

42:54.210 --> 42:55.543
Yeah.

42:55.626 --> 42:58.126
Then tell me,
what's a man without respect?

43:01.376 --> 43:02.751
Nothing.

43:04.960 --> 43:09.918
You see, school's good, man.
School is good.

43:12.001 --> 43:13.876
But what are you gonna do after?

43:16.335 --> 43:19.710
Sure you can work for
one of them white companies.

43:21.293 --> 43:23.168
Let them pimp out your life.

43:25.710 --> 43:27.168
Or...

43:29.043 --> 43:32.501
you can work for yourself and be free.

43:35.585 --> 43:37.335
You wanna be free?

43:41.418 --> 43:42.793
I'm down.

43:45.626 --> 43:46.918
A'ight.

43:49.668 --> 43:51.085
Here y'are.

43:59.126 --> 44:00.501
Hold it in.

44:07.126 --> 44:08.751
Ah...

44:09.335 --> 44:10.710
Fuck.

44:15.543 --> 44:17.335
My lieutenant.

44:35.626 --> 44:37.335
So here we are again.

44:39.543 --> 44:42.085
I'm sure you've heard a few things
this evening

44:42.168 --> 44:44.335
that you didn't really want to hear.

44:44.418 --> 44:48.168
They are only saying the truth,
since he wants to destroy his life.

44:49.210 --> 44:52.251
Moving forward,
I want to see how we can work into

44:52.335 --> 44:54.335
getting him through these exams.

44:54.418 --> 44:57.918
Clearly we cannot move anywhere
because he refuses to listen.

45:00.626 --> 45:03.460
- Femi?
- What?

45:03.543 --> 45:05.751
"What"? Who are you "what"-ing?

45:05.835 --> 45:08.460
Is that how I taught you
to speak to an elder?

45:09.335 --> 45:11.460
- It's OK.
- No, it's not OK.

45:11.543 --> 45:15.210
There is nothing OK
about his rotten attitude.

45:15.418 --> 45:19.293
Do you know how embarrassing it is
to come here over and over again

45:19.376 --> 45:21.168
- and hear the same thing?
- Hmm.

45:21.251 --> 45:24.210
No improvement.
And tonight was the worst.

45:24.293 --> 45:27.085
You are not failing me,
you are failing yourself.

45:47.460 --> 45:50.335
- Hey.
- What do you want?

45:51.293 --> 45:52.376
Nothing.

45:53.626 --> 45:55.001
What you doing out here?

45:55.835 --> 45:58.210
Just waiting for Mum and Dad to finish.

46:01.085 --> 46:02.085
I should go...

46:02.168 --> 46:03.876
- No, wait.
- Why?

46:05.126 --> 46:06.751
What you listening to?

46:06.835 --> 46:09.835
Um... just some weird stuff.
I don't really know.

46:10.001 --> 46:13.001
- Mind if I listen?
- Why?

46:13.418 --> 46:15.460
Why not, innit?

46:33.418 --> 46:36.960
<i>♪ Crying for the death of your heart</i>

46:38.126 --> 46:41.668
<i>♪ You were stone white, so delicate</i>

46:41.751 --> 46:43.793
<i>♪ Lost in the cold</i>

46:43.876 --> 46:48.126
<i>♪ You were always so lost in the dark</i>

46:49.668 --> 46:52.168
<i>♪ Remembering you</i>

46:52.251 --> 46:55.210
<i>♪ How you used to be</i>

46:55.293 --> 46:58.043

46:58.126 --> 47:01.418
<i>♪ So much more than everything</i>

47:01.501 --> 47:06.751

47:08.960 --> 47:12.335
<i>♪ But I never see anything</i>

47:12.418 --> 47:16.293
<i>♪ If only I'd thought
of the right words...</i>

47:19.043 --> 47:21.376
I told you it was weird.

47:22.085 --> 47:23.543
No.

47:25.126 --> 47:26.751
No, it's cool.

47:29.751 --> 47:31.501
Why are you being nice to me?

47:31.585 --> 47:37.043
You know the whole light skin,
dark skin thing is a joke, right?

47:39.501 --> 47:42.418
You're the prettiest girl in school.
You shouldn't let it get to you.

47:42.501 --> 47:43.793
You shouldn't encourage it.

47:43.876 --> 47:46.668
- I didn't encourage it. I stopped him.
- After he had his fun.

47:47.960 --> 47:49.960
What are you doing right now?

47:50.043 --> 47:52.126
I came out here, saw you,
thought we could have a chat.

47:52.210 --> 47:56.460
Femi, we don't talk. We're not friends.
I'm not friends with your friends.

47:57.585 --> 47:59.293
I don't know what you're playing at
right now.

47:59.376 --> 48:02.751
My mum's right in there, you know.
She knows who you are.

48:03.168 --> 48:05.085
I told her about you lot.

48:07.168 --> 48:10.668
I don't know if you're trying to be
nice to me but you're a bit late, man.

48:10.751 --> 48:13.085
You should have been nice last week.

48:13.168 --> 48:15.710
You should've stopped him
the week before that.

48:15.793 --> 48:16.960
Or the week before that.

48:17.043 --> 48:20.710
I ain't trying to do nothing.
I just wanted to chat to you, innit?

48:20.793 --> 48:25.918
Talk to me about what?
What, how black I am? How blick I am?

48:26.126 --> 48:30.210
Prettiest girl in the fucking school.
Say that when your fucking friends are there.

48:30.293 --> 48:32.626
What do you want me to say, like?
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?

48:32.710 --> 48:34.835
I don't want you to
say sorry, I just...

48:36.376 --> 48:38.501
I just want you to get it.

48:39.210 --> 48:40.710
Just get it.

48:50.251 --> 48:52.126
I should go.

48:52.210 --> 48:53.668
Bye.

49:19.001 --> 49:20.876
Living room. Now.

49:36.501 --> 49:37.835
Is that it?

49:39.210 --> 49:40.710
No stick?

49:43.501 --> 49:45.335
I hate you.

50:05.543 --> 50:08.918
I got pulled over by this
idiot police officer last week.

50:09.001 --> 50:11.876
He said it was one of them
routine checks, you know?

50:12.335 --> 50:15.293
I asked him, "What's the difference
between me and the prime minister?"

50:16.751 --> 50:21.251
I know in his mind he was thinking,
"A lot of things, you fucking nigger."

50:22.876 --> 50:25.418
He has the legal right to kill, steal,

50:25.501 --> 50:29.043
do whatever he has to do
to protect what's his. But me?

50:31.376 --> 50:34.210
If I do all those things,
I get sent to jail.

50:35.918 --> 50:39.043
The prime minister's the biggest
fucking nigger on road.

50:53.876 --> 50:55.293
Go check.

51:07.376 --> 51:09.335
How's the phone? Is it good?

51:12.126 --> 51:15.585
I'll get you an upgrade soon.
I'll sort that, yeah?

51:16.751 --> 51:18.501
Nah, it's OK.

51:19.126 --> 51:22.793
OK? Nah, you should
never settle for OK, man.

51:22.876 --> 51:25.126
Let that be a life lesson, yeah?

51:31.210 --> 51:34.710
You scared?

51:34.793 --> 51:36.168
No.

51:47.376 --> 51:51.251
Yo, don't move. If you hear anything,
shout us but do not move.

52:57.543 --> 52:59.793
What happened?

53:04.043 --> 53:05.585
What happened back there?

53:09.251 --> 53:11.085
Yo, what happened back there?

53:31.168 --> 53:35.876
Gonna be your turn next time.
I'ma call on you tomorrow, yeah?

53:40.043 --> 53:42.293
Ain't got no blood on it. Take it.

53:48.835 --> 53:50.543
A'ight, cool.

54:09.001 --> 54:10.960
- Where have you been?
- What's going on?

54:11.001 --> 54:11.876
What's he doing here?

54:11.960 --> 54:17.126
You told me you had football practice
with the school team. There wasn't any.

54:18.001 --> 54:21.751
Sit down!

54:26.251 --> 54:28.626
If I knew you was coming,
I would have told a better lie.

54:29.001 --> 54:32.168
- That doesn't help.
- Look, this isn't your classroom.

54:32.251 --> 54:33.918
And you ain't my dad, so you can't...

54:34.001 --> 54:37.210
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh...
- Femi, believe it or not,

54:37.710 --> 54:42.210
I grew up around here and a lot
of the boys I went to school with

54:43.126 --> 54:45.085
are in jail as we speak.

54:46.376 --> 54:47.710
And I was close to joining them.

54:49.835 --> 54:54.043
Now, I know to you, I'm just
a boring teacher who's old as fuck.

54:55.918 --> 54:58.585
But I haven't always been this preppy.

55:03.251 --> 55:07.085
Now, your mum and I had a chat
at parents' evening,

55:08.001 --> 55:11.126
and I think you can really
pull through these exams.

55:12.168 --> 55:14.501
You've got to let me help you.

55:22.293 --> 55:24.376
Your wife's pregnant, right?

55:25.668 --> 55:27.043
That's what you said in class
the other day.

55:29.835 --> 55:31.543
Yeah, she is.

55:32.543 --> 55:34.335
First child?

55:34.918 --> 55:36.376
Yeah.

55:41.626 --> 55:44.585
You're gonna be there for the kid, right?

55:47.418 --> 55:52.335
Yeah, I have to be,
but what's your point?

55:58.626 --> 55:59.918
Nothing.

56:00.668 --> 56:04.335
I'm gonna get some sleep.
Got class tomorrow.

56:05.876 --> 56:07.585
See you there, sir.

56:08.251 --> 56:09.668
Femi.

56:21.835 --> 56:25.751
I appreciate what you did last night.
Seriously, man.

56:25.835 --> 56:30.418
Trust is the biggest thing in this game,
and you showed guts.

56:30.501 --> 56:31.626
If you are smart enough,

56:31.710 --> 56:34.460
you can get to a position
where you are making decisions,

56:34.543 --> 56:36.626
you're not taking orders
from anyone else.

56:36.710 --> 56:38.793
You can go places.

56:42.960 --> 56:44.668
What is it you want me to do?

56:46.710 --> 56:49.460
Patience, big man.

56:50.251 --> 56:52.126
All in due time.

56:52.210 --> 56:55.335
Do me a favour, get me some water
and chewing gum in the shop, please.

56:55.418 --> 56:58.043
Get yourself what you want, innit,
keep the change.

56:58.626 --> 56:59.960
Cool.

57:49.543 --> 57:51.710
- Mace, that's enough!
- Get the fuck off me!

57:51.793 --> 57:53.043
Let's go.

58:05.501 --> 58:07.668
- Yo, what happened?
- Where the fuck were you, man?

58:07.751 --> 58:11.126
- You told me to stay in the car.
- Just drive.

58:28.585 --> 58:31.460
Go inside and sit down.
Where you going?

58:31.543 --> 58:32.835
Can I go?

58:36.668 --> 58:38.501
- How much we got?
- Who's that?

58:38.585 --> 58:40.251
He's cool.

59:17.001 --> 59:18.501
Shauna.

59:19.085 --> 59:20.543
Come here.

59:24.501 --> 59:26.001
Hello.

59:28.001 --> 59:31.960
All right? How you doing?

59:54.168 --> 59:56.668
<i>You know you and Dwayne are the
only ones that know about this.</i>

59:59.126 --> 01:00:01.085
I've got a lot of enemies.

01:00:08.418 --> 01:00:11.626
Man's got to do what he can
to protect his family.

01:00:18.543 --> 01:00:20.335
We're brothers now.

01:00:25.751 --> 01:00:27.376
I have to get back to class.

01:00:28.043 --> 01:00:29.460
A'ight.

01:02:10.918 --> 01:02:12.710
What the fuck, man?

01:02:12.793 --> 01:02:16.876
- Let's go, man. Dickhead.
- You're bugging, bruv. What the fuck?

01:02:21.626 --> 01:02:23.085
Femi...

01:02:23.793 --> 01:02:25.543
Are you all right?

01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:36.418
Do you want me to call someone?

01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:40.668
Femi, what's wrong?

01:02:47.168 --> 01:02:48.501
Femi!

01:02:51.751 --> 01:02:55.293
<i>You missed my class today. Again.</i>

01:02:55.376 --> 01:02:58.460
<i>- I'm not in the mood today, sir.
- I'm not in the mood either.</i>

01:02:58.543 --> 01:03:03.126
<i>You come in here stinking of weed,
you've got specks of blood all down you.</i>

01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:06.335
<i>I told your mum you wouldn't fail,
not on my watch.</i>

01:03:06.418 --> 01:03:08.543
<i>That's where you fucked up.</i>

01:03:10.293 --> 01:03:11.751
What do you want from me?

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.668
Always the tough guy.

01:03:15.376 --> 01:03:18.876
<i>Your mum told me
about your foster care.</i>

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:21.043
<i>I can't imagine what that
must've been like.</i>

01:03:21.126 --> 01:03:24.126
<i>- That ain't your business.
- Confusion.</i>

01:03:24.793 --> 01:03:26.460
Yeah, and what?

01:03:27.501 --> 01:03:31.001
<i>You don't know shit about it,
so stop right there.</i>

01:03:31.085 --> 01:03:32.626
Or what?

01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:40.168
- Shit.
- No, no. No, no, no.

01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:42.960
- I've not finished talking.
- Get the fuck out of my way!

01:03:43.043 --> 01:03:44.793
<i>You think I'm playing with you?</i>

01:03:45.626 --> 01:03:47.960
I call my boys and you're fucked.
You hear me?

01:03:48.043 --> 01:03:49.418
Call them.

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:52.710
You really think those boys
are your friends?

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.585
You've got every right to be angry.

01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:00.126
"My parents leave me because they
don't care enough about me to raise me."

01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:01.376
Don't fuck with me, man.

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:03.751
"Send me off to the country
to people that aren't even my own."

01:04:03.835 --> 01:04:05.376
- I mean it.
- I would be angry.

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.585
- They left you, Femi.
- Don't fuck with me.

01:04:08.668 --> 01:04:11.418
- They didn't care enough to raise you.
- Don't fuck with me, man!

01:04:12.585 --> 01:04:15.710
I said don't fuck with me. You hear me?
I said don't fuck with me!

01:04:15.793 --> 01:04:18.335
Don't fuck with me!
Don't fuck with me!

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:24.793
Aren't you going to say hello?
This is our guest, remember?

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:26.751
Hello.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:28.793
Hey.

01:06:30.418 --> 01:06:33.376
Don't forget to eat your peas.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.626
When I was here...

01:07:00.293 --> 01:07:03.585
you shouldn't have said yes when
I asked you if I could stay for good.

01:07:07.835 --> 01:07:11.126
I mean, I know why you did it.

01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:15.626
But I believed you.

01:07:17.335 --> 01:07:19.251
Messed me up for a while.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:28.251
I should never have said it.

01:07:32.126 --> 01:07:33.960
I was too attached.

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:37.835
How are you two?

01:07:42.293 --> 01:07:44.126
Struggling.

01:07:58.543 --> 01:08:02.210
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hm-hmm.

01:08:05.126 --> 01:08:06.668
Why do you do it?

01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:13.001
I mean, what's in it for you?
Is it the money?

01:08:15.918 --> 01:08:17.335
Because...

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:22.210
I don't know.

01:08:24.251 --> 01:08:30.501
I wouldn't change being part of you
or Ola or any of you for all the world.

01:08:32.167 --> 01:08:34.376
I'm proud of all of you.

01:08:35.667 --> 01:08:37.542
That's what's in it for me.

01:08:40.085 --> 01:08:42.210
In a way, you're all my boys.

01:08:46.376 --> 01:08:47.917
But we're not.

01:09:40.501 --> 01:09:41.585
You're a joker!

01:09:41.667 --> 01:09:43.876
All right, one more time.
I'm gonna jump...

01:09:49.292 --> 01:09:51.542
Oh, my God. You're too strong.

01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:05.126
<i>- Turbo.
- Turbo. Oh, my God.</i>

01:10:07.085 --> 01:10:08.585
<i>Whoa!</i>

01:10:11.543 --> 01:10:15.085
<i>All right, you have to carry me
on your back now. You ready?</i>

01:10:15.168 --> 01:10:16.710
<i>Three, two...</i>

01:10:19.210 --> 01:10:21.168
<i>You've got to be
stronger than that.</i>

01:10:28.168 --> 01:10:30.126
<i>We're going too fast. Slow down.</i>

01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:32.126
<i>Slow down.</i>

01:10:40.876 --> 01:10:43.585
I hope you come and see us again soon.

01:10:44.335 --> 01:10:45.876
Let me know how it goes.

01:10:50.376 --> 01:10:51.376
Bye.

01:11:00.251 --> 01:11:01.626
See you.

01:11:25.918 --> 01:11:27.168
Come in.

01:11:35.168 --> 01:11:36.835
So how was Mary?

01:11:40.335 --> 01:11:41.751
It was OK.

01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:46.835
And how are you?

01:11:49.501 --> 01:11:50.835
I'm OK.

01:11:53.585 --> 01:11:55.126
OK.

01:11:56.876 --> 01:11:58.293
Erm...

01:11:58.376 --> 01:12:02.085
I'll leave you to do your work.
There's jollof in the pot.

01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:52.210
Bro, there's, like, five people
speaking in the class.

01:12:52.293 --> 01:12:55.668
I say two words to my friend, "Yo,
give me the sharpener," or something,

01:12:55.751 --> 01:12:56.793
and she gets onto me.

01:12:56.876 --> 01:12:59.418
- Yo, you know what she's like.
- Why is she like that, man?

01:12:59.501 --> 01:13:00.835
Why is she hating on me?

01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:02.876
You saw the way she was
at parents' evening.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.835
- Yeah? So it's not just me, yeah?
- It's not just you, my G.

01:13:05.918 --> 01:13:08.210
It's a black thing.

01:13:08.293 --> 01:13:12.210
Maybe. Yo, don't turn around.
Just keep walking.

01:13:19.001 --> 01:13:21.085
If anything happens, you keep walking.

01:13:22.626 --> 01:13:24.668
Is something wrong with your phone?

01:13:27.835 --> 01:13:28.960
Yeah.

01:13:29.043 --> 01:13:31.751
Why didn't you tell me?
You know I would've got you a new one.

01:13:31.835 --> 01:13:33.418
Mace, man. Come on.

01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:37.751
- Come on, bro.
- Big boy, innit?

01:13:37.835 --> 01:13:40.043
- Touching people and that.
- I know you're...

01:13:40.126 --> 01:13:42.001
Don't ever fucking touch me in your life,
yeah?

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:44.460
- Don't you ever fucking touch me.
- Get off me, brother!

01:13:44.543 --> 01:13:46.876
Don't say my name as well.
Get the fuck out of here, man.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.126
Are you dumb? What!

01:13:54.043 --> 01:13:56.085
Got a big mouth, innit?

01:13:58.126 --> 01:14:00.085
- Hey, get in the car please.
- What?

01:14:00.168 --> 01:14:01.585
I said get in the car!

01:14:13.668 --> 01:14:16.543
I thought we had an understanding.
I thought we were brothers.

01:14:19.793 --> 01:14:21.251
I guess not.

01:14:22.668 --> 01:14:25.751
You know what has to happen if you don't
do this. I don't want that to happen, bruv.

01:14:25.835 --> 01:14:28.543
- Nothing has to happen.
- Yes, something has to happen.

01:14:37.585 --> 01:14:38.960
All right.

01:14:59.668 --> 01:15:01.376
You ain't got to do this, man.

01:15:04.251 --> 01:15:06.710
Get up!

01:15:06.793 --> 01:15:08.543
Hmm?

01:15:08.626 --> 01:15:11.085
Fuck.

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:17.876
I didn't bring you here for this.

01:18:23.001 --> 01:18:25.210
I'm sorry.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.710
I'm so sorry.

01:18:30.168 --> 01:18:31.585
It's OK.

01:18:31.668 --> 01:18:35.043
No. I know how you look at me.

01:18:35.793 --> 01:18:40.001
I... I just wanted
what was best for you.

01:18:40.085 --> 01:18:43.668
I... I wanted you
to have the best opportunities,

01:18:43.751 --> 01:18:48.543
things I couldn't have,
and I don't know what I could have done.

01:18:48.626 --> 01:18:54.293
I didn't have anybody.
I didn't have anything. And I just...

01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:00.751
I always loved you.

01:19:01.626 --> 01:19:04.168
I will always love you.

01:19:07.501 --> 01:19:10.626
Even... even if you hate me.

01:19:16.876 --> 01:19:18.626
I don't... I don't hate you.

01:20:48.168 --> 01:20:49.668
You coming in?

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:58.043
Get up then.

01:23:05.751 --> 01:23:09.085
Welcome, ma'am. Welcome, sir.
Can I help you with that?

01:23:17.918 --> 01:23:19.751
Where is he? Why are we waiting here?

01:23:19.835 --> 01:23:22.501
Your father's wife
wants to meet you first.

01:23:43.543 --> 01:23:44.043
Hello.

01:23:48.376 --> 01:23:50.960
- This is my son, Olufemi.
- Hello, ma'am.

01:23:51.043 --> 01:23:53.335
- Femi, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

01:23:55.835 --> 01:23:59.335
Hmm. Erm, OK <i>...</i>

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:02.710
I'm just going to go.

01:25:54.168 --> 01:25:56.376
Do you want some water, sir?

01:25:57.168 --> 01:25:58.710
No, thank you.

01:25:59.835 --> 01:26:01.293
Tea, sir?

01:26:02.126 --> 01:26:04.168
No. I'm good.

01:26:05.085 --> 01:26:08.876
- Juice, sir?
- No, I'm all right. Thanks.

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:13.001
- Food, sir?
- No, I'm... I'm fine.

01:26:14.751 --> 01:26:18.626
- You don't want anything at all, sir?
- No, I'm absolutely fine. Thank you.

01:26:20.210 --> 01:26:21.918
Thank you, sir.

01:26:35.085 --> 01:26:38.793
- You OK?
- Hm-hmm. He's waiting for you.

01:26:40.168 --> 01:26:41.626
It's OK.

01:27:07.918 --> 01:27:10.043
<i>You must have questions.</i>

01:27:11.543 --> 01:27:13.460
<i>Why is my mum upset?</i>

01:27:15.126 --> 01:27:17.043
<i>Do you know what I do?</i>

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:19.626
<i>You're a pastor.</i>

01:27:20.543 --> 01:27:23.043
<i>Your mum says you
are not religious.</i>

01:27:23.126 --> 01:27:26.668
<i>I'm not even surprised.
She's always been a wildflower.</i>

01:27:28.335 --> 01:27:31.543
You know she wasn't raised
by her own mother and father.

01:27:32.251 --> 01:27:33.585
What?

01:27:34.210 --> 01:27:37.960
Yes.
She has no understanding of authority.

01:27:38.251 --> 01:27:42.501
She didn't know how to submit
the way a wife should.

01:27:42.585 --> 01:27:46.543
That woman still believes
in the old spiritual nonsense.

01:27:48.168 --> 01:27:49.501
Anyway, you are home now.

01:27:49.585 --> 01:27:52.501
If you really cared about that,
then why have you waited so long?

01:27:52.585 --> 01:27:54.918
It wasn't my choice for you
to be raised by Oyinbo.

01:27:55.001 --> 01:27:56.668
She had no support.

01:27:58.918 --> 01:28:00.376
Where were you?

01:28:02.126 --> 01:28:03.960
Why didn't you invite me
to come and live with you?

01:28:04.001 --> 01:28:05.960
I mean, you've got plenty of space.

01:28:08.793 --> 01:28:10.168
- Wale.
- Sir?

01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:11.501
Come here.

01:28:13.876 --> 01:28:16.835
All right, sir.

01:28:32.376 --> 01:28:36.501
Ade, Sade, meet Femi, your brother.

01:28:58.043 --> 01:28:59.501
How did it go?

01:29:04.501 --> 01:29:06.126
What did he say?

01:29:10.001 --> 01:29:11.501
Nothing important.

01:29:12.918 --> 01:29:14.335
Let's go.

01:29:46.918 --> 01:29:49.710
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

01:29:53.376 --> 01:29:54.793
Yeah, I want some.

01:29:56.876 --> 01:29:59.335
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Thank you.

01:29:59.876 --> 01:30:02.126
OK, let me...

01:30:03.876 --> 01:30:06.085
Oh! That was nice.

01:30:06.168 --> 01:30:08.543
Come, come, come. Play. Right, right.

01:30:09.043 --> 01:30:10.835
Oh, in the middle.

01:30:11.710 --> 01:30:13.793
Come on. You've gotta come try it.

01:33:16.168 --> 01:33:17.710
Whoo!
