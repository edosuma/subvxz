WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.039
PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...

00:08.039 --> 00:09.080
PRINCIPAL TANG, DID YOU
TALK TO THE SCHOOL BOARD?

00:09.080 --> 00:10.781
YES, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

00:10.781 --> 00:12.743
MARK, I SAID
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

00:12.743 --> 00:14.415
I'VE MISSED YOU TOO,
MRS. PORTER.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.317
OH NO, I WENT BACK
TO MY MAIDEN NAME
A FEW YEARS AGO

00:16.317 --> 00:17.688
AFTER THE DIVORCE
WAS FINALIZED.

00:17.688 --> 00:18.649
REGINA NEVER TALKED ABOUT

00:18.649 --> 00:20.151
ANYONE WHO WOULD
SEND SOMETHING LIKE THIS;

00:20.151 --> 00:21.492
CERTAINLY NO ONE

00:21.492 --> 00:23.554
FROM A RANDOM APARTMENT
BUILDING IN CONNECTICUT.

00:23.554 --> 00:25.156
Danny: HAVE YOU
EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
HOW REGINA CRANE

00:25.156 --> 00:27.027
GOT AHOLD OF THAT NECKLACE?

00:27.027 --> 00:28.699
DID DAD KNOW HER? REGINA?
DID THEY EVER MEET?

00:28.699 --> 00:30.461
WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING
IS DISGUSTING.

00:30.461 --> 00:31.632
THIS WITNESS

00:31.632 --> 00:33.404
SAW YOU WALK OUT ONTO THE DOCK

00:33.404 --> 00:35.206
AND THROW SOMETHING
INTO THE POND.

00:35.206 --> 00:37.268
WE SEARCHED THE POND
AND FOUND THIS.

00:37.268 --> 00:39.640
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU'RE
RISKING BEING WITH ME.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.572
IT'S WORTH THE RISK.

00:43.314 --> 00:44.645
Kyle: THEN WHAT IS THE TRUTH?

00:44.645 --> 00:47.318
I KILLED REGINA CRANE.

01:00.831 --> 01:02.493
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

01:03.694 --> 01:08.439
MY MOTHER JUST CONFESSED
TO THE MURDER OF
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

01:08.439 --> 01:10.841
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
WHAT TO THINK RIGHT NOW.

01:10.841 --> 01:13.204
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
HOW'RE YOU DOING?

01:16.677 --> 01:18.149
WE'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS, OKAY?

01:24.215 --> 01:25.716
HEY.
I GOT YOUR TEXT.

01:25.716 --> 01:27.188
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:27.188 --> 01:29.490
Karen: HOW MANY TIMES DO
WE HAVE TO GO OVER THIS?

01:29.490 --> 01:32.223
AS MANY TIMES AS IT TAKES
FOR YOU TO TELL ME THE TRUTH.

01:32.223 --> 01:33.664
I KILLED HER, KYLE.

01:33.664 --> 01:35.326
I WISH I HADN'T,
BUT I DID.

01:35.326 --> 01:36.667
FINE.
START AT THE BEGINNING.

01:36.667 --> 01:39.770
I'D GONE INTO
SCHOOL THAT DAY

01:39.770 --> 01:41.732
FOR A MEETING WITH
DANNY AND THE PRINCIPAL.

01:41.732 --> 01:44.135
I PASSED REGINA
IN THE HALL

01:44.135 --> 01:46.337
WEARING THAT NECKLACE.

01:46.337 --> 01:48.679
I KNEW RIGHT AWAY
IT WAS TARA'S.

01:48.679 --> 01:51.712
I KNEW VIK MUST HAVE
GIVEN TO HER.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.145
DID YOU KNOW VIK HAD BEEN
CHEATING ON YOU WITH SOMEONE?

01:54.145 --> 01:55.416
I HAD MY SUSPICIONS.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.388
I TRIED TO FORGET ABOUT IT,
BUT I COULDN'T.

01:57.388 --> 01:59.150
SO LATER THAT NIGHT,

01:59.150 --> 02:00.691
I WENT TO CONFRONT HER.

02:00.691 --> 02:02.193
AND SHE TOLD ME
THAT SHE AND VIK

02:02.193 --> 02:04.225
WERE IN LOVE
BEFORE HIS ACCIDENT.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.656
SHE SAID SHE WAS
STILL IN LOVE WITH HIM

02:05.656 --> 02:07.458
AND THAT SHE WOULD
ALWAYS LOVE HIM.

02:07.458 --> 02:09.630
AND I JUST--

02:09.630 --> 02:10.831
I SNAPPED.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.504
I GRABBED SOMETHING AND
HIT HER OVER THE HEAD WITH IT.

02:13.504 --> 02:14.835
BUT YOU CAN'T
REMEMBER WHAT?

02:14.835 --> 02:16.567
I WAS IN SHOCK.

02:16.567 --> 02:19.340
WE NEVER FOUND
THE MURDER WEAPON.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.711
WELL, MAYBE YOU DIDN'T
LOOK HARD ENOUGH.

02:20.711 --> 02:22.713
AND YOUR FINGERPRINTS
ARE NOWHERE AT THE CRIME SCENE.

02:22.713 --> 02:24.345
I WAS CAREFUL.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.776
YOU JUST SAID
YOU WERE IN SHOCK.

02:25.776 --> 02:28.279
( scoffs )
WHY WOULD I LIE ABOUT THIS?

02:28.279 --> 02:29.780
YOU AND I
BOTH KNOW WHY.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.652
ARE YOU GOING TO
CHARGE ME OR NOT?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.684
I HAVE 48 HOURS

02:33.684 --> 02:35.756
UNTIL I'M LEGALLY REQUIRED
TO CALL THE D.A.,

02:35.756 --> 02:37.788
TWO DAYS TO
CONFIRM YOUR STORY.

02:37.788 --> 02:40.561
IF YOU RELEASE ME,
I'LL JUST GO TO THE PRESS.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.862
HOW'S THAT GONNA
MAKE YOU LOOK?

02:41.862 --> 02:43.734
WELL, THAT'S A CHANCE
I'LL JUST HAVE TO TAKE

02:43.734 --> 02:45.696
'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA
ARREST YOU UNTIL I'M SURE.

02:45.696 --> 02:48.699
I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO MY SON NOW.

02:53.404 --> 02:54.645
( camera beeps )

02:56.877 --> 02:58.409
( sighs )

03:01.952 --> 03:03.254
DANNY TEXTED ME.

03:04.615 --> 03:05.816
DAD, DID SHE SAY
WHY SHE--

03:05.816 --> 03:07.288
YOU THINK I'M
GONNA ANSWER THAT?

03:09.590 --> 03:10.761
SHE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

03:14.265 --> 03:15.366
YOU OKAY?

03:15.366 --> 03:17.728
YEAH, I'M JUST
A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.

03:18.769 --> 03:20.771
IT'S LATE.

03:20.771 --> 03:22.633
I'LL HAVE AN OFFICER DRIVE
YOU AND LACEY HOME.

03:22.633 --> 03:23.934
I'M NOT LEAVING.

03:23.934 --> 03:25.706
ME NEITHER.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.940
LEAD THE WAY, CHIEF MASTERSON.

03:38.989 --> 03:41.952
MRS. DESAI?
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

03:44.255 --> 03:45.356
DO YOU REALLY THINK
SHE'S CAPABLE

03:45.356 --> 03:46.697
OF DOING SOMETHING
LIKE THIS?

03:46.697 --> 03:48.859
WHO WOULD CONFESS TO MURDERING
SOMEONE IF THEY DIDN'T?

03:48.859 --> 03:52.002
I GUESS THIS CONFIRMS
VIKRAM AND REGINA WERE
HAVING AN AFFAIR.

03:52.002 --> 03:55.005
DO YOU THINK MRS. DESAI
SENT THAT CASH AND NOTE?

03:55.005 --> 03:57.668
WHO KNOWS?
HONESTLY, I'M TOO TIRED

03:57.668 --> 03:58.869
TO THINK ABOUT IT
RIGHT NOW.

03:58.869 --> 04:01.272
GOD, I WAS ALREADY
DREADING THIS WEEKEND.

04:01.272 --> 04:02.773
AND NOW ALL THIS.

04:02.773 --> 04:04.415
WHAT'S THIS WEEKEND?

04:04.415 --> 04:06.277
MY SISTER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

04:06.277 --> 04:07.718
MY DAD'S FLYING IN
FROM SEATTLE.

04:07.718 --> 04:09.850
OH, WOW.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.982
I HAVEN'T SEEN
YOUR DAD IN FOREVER.

04:13.624 --> 04:15.025
HOW IS EVERYTHING...

04:15.025 --> 04:17.027
WITH YOU AND YOUR DAD?
IS IT STILL--

04:17.027 --> 04:18.459
IT'S FINE, JO.
WE'RE FINE.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.693
I WONDER WHAT
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

04:26.537 --> 04:28.769
YOU STILL THINK I KILLED HER.
DON'T YOU?

04:30.801 --> 04:32.272
I DIDN'T DO IT.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.044
I KNOW. I DID.

04:34.044 --> 04:36.707
I COULDN'T WATCH YOU
BEING ATTACKED

04:36.707 --> 04:38.278
FOR A CRIME
I COMMITTED.

04:39.810 --> 04:41.652
I COULDN'T LIVE
WITH THE GUILT.

04:41.652 --> 04:45.456
SO WHAT?
YOU KILLED REGINA?

04:46.717 --> 04:48.489
YOU TOOK HER NECKLACE...

04:48.489 --> 04:49.860
AND YOU PLANTED IT
IN MY LOCKER? WHY?

04:49.860 --> 04:50.691
WHY WOULD YOU DO ALL THAT?

04:50.691 --> 04:52.323
WHO SAYS IT WAS
IN YOUR LOCKER?

04:54.395 --> 04:57.428
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE
TO KEEP THINKING ABOUT
THIS ANYMORE.

04:58.829 --> 05:00.331
GO BE A TEENAGER.

05:00.331 --> 05:02.503
GO TO SCHOOL.
HAVE FUN.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.704
BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

05:03.704 --> 05:06.737
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.884
( theme music playing )

05:18.789 --> 05:20.591
OKAY, HAVE YOU CONSIDERED

05:20.591 --> 05:22.322
THAT MAYBE SHE'S
TELLING THE TRUTH?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.824
OF COURSE, BUT WHY CONFESS NOW?

05:23.824 --> 05:25.356
'CAUSE WE HAVE PROOF

05:25.356 --> 05:26.797
- THAT SHE DISPOSED OF EVIDENCE.
- DISPOSED OF EVIDENCE,

05:26.797 --> 05:28.959
OBSTRUCTED OUR CASE,
BUT NOT COMMITTED MURDER.

05:28.959 --> 05:30.961
OKAY, WELL, SHE TOSSED THAT
NECKLACE AFTER THAT RAID.

05:30.961 --> 05:32.963
IT'S POSSIBLE SHE WAS
COVERING HER OWN TRACKS.

05:32.963 --> 05:34.835
MAYBE. BUT HER STORY'S WEAK.

05:34.835 --> 05:35.836
I MEAN, SHE REMEMBERS
HER FIGHT WITH REGINA,

05:35.836 --> 05:37.337
BUT NOT WHAT SHE
USED TO HIT HER?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.840
SHE WAS SPECIFIC ABOUT
WHERE THAT BODY WAS FOUND.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.011
SO WAS THE GREEN GROVE GAZETTE.

05:41.011 --> 05:42.843
ANYONE WHO READ THE NEWSPAPER
WOULD KNOW THAT.

05:42.843 --> 05:43.974
IT'S THE TEXT.

05:43.974 --> 05:45.476
IF KAREN REALLY DID THIS,

05:45.476 --> 05:47.618
WHY DID REGINA TEXT DANNY
RIGHT BEFORE SHE DIED?

05:47.618 --> 05:49.550
- IS THAT JUST A COINCIDENCE?
- I DON'T KNOW, CHIEF.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.653
BUT IF REGINA AND VIKRAM
WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR,

05:52.653 --> 05:54.785
KAREN HAD SOMETHING THAT
WE CAN'T PROVE HER SON HAD.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.127
A MOTIVE.

05:57.127 --> 05:58.729
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
THAT VIKRAM AND REGINA

05:58.729 --> 06:00.060
EVER KNEW EACH OTHER.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.692
YOU REALLY BELIEVE SHE'S
COVERING FOR THE KID?

06:01.692 --> 06:04.965
BECAUSE I THINK, IF HE HAS
EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CONSCIENCE,

06:04.965 --> 06:07.097
HE WON'T LET HIS OWN MOTHER
TAKE THE FALL.

06:07.097 --> 06:10.100
Lacey: DID YOU EVER ASK HER
ABOUT REGINA AND YOUR DAD?

06:10.100 --> 06:12.573
YEAH, SHE DENIED THAT ANYTHING
WAS GOING ON BETWEEN THEM,

06:12.573 --> 06:13.804
BUT...

06:13.804 --> 06:14.805
BUT WHAT?

06:14.805 --> 06:16.747
SHE GOT UPSET,
DEFENSIVE.

06:16.747 --> 06:20.380
IT SEEMED LIKE SHE
KIND OF KNEW ABOUT IT.

06:22.012 --> 06:24.054
- ( door opens )
- ALL RIGHT, DANNY.

06:24.054 --> 06:26.557
WE'RE HOLDING YOUR MOM
FOR 48 HOURS.

06:26.557 --> 06:28.419
OKAY.
THEN WHAT?

06:28.419 --> 06:29.660
AND THEN WE HAVE TO DECIDE

06:29.660 --> 06:30.761
IF WE'RE GONNA FORMALLY
CHARGE HER OR NOT.

06:30.761 --> 06:32.092
SO YOU THINK SHE WAS LYING?

06:34.164 --> 06:35.866
ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER

06:35.866 --> 06:36.867
AND REGINA CRANE, DANNY?

06:36.867 --> 06:38.499
ANYTHING AT ALL?

06:38.499 --> 06:40.431
NO, NOTHING.

06:42.833 --> 06:44.805
OKAY. WELL, JUST
THINK ABOUT IT.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.437
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU'LL STAY WITH US.

06:48.439 --> 06:49.440
YOU'D LET DANNY
STAY WITH US?

06:49.440 --> 06:50.711
AT OUR HOUSE?

06:50.711 --> 06:52.713
OF COURSE.
HE'S A MINOR.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.715
HE CAN'T GO HOME
WITHOUT A LEGAL GUARDIAN.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.888
THANK YOU, CHIEF MASTERSON.

06:57.888 --> 06:59.790
YOU'RE WELCOME, DANNY.

06:59.790 --> 07:01.191
Lacey: CHIEF MASTERSON
ISN'T A BAD GUY.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.824
I DIDN'T SAY HE WAS,
BUT I'VE BEEN

07:03.824 --> 07:05.696
HIS PRIME SUSPECT
FOR WEEKS NOW.

07:05.696 --> 07:06.757
YOU THINK THAT'S
GONNA CHANGE?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.931
WHAT IF WE TOLD HIM
ABOUT EVERYTHING:

07:10.931 --> 07:13.734
THE CASH, THE NOTE,
THE APARTMENT IN CONNECTICUT?

07:13.734 --> 07:16.567
YOUR MOM'S THE MOST
LIKELY PERSON TO KNOW
ABOUT THAT APARTMENT.

07:16.567 --> 07:18.809
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE MY MOM
WOULD HURT SOMEBODY.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.443
ME EITHER.

07:26.817 --> 07:28.879
BUT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER
THAT SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH

07:28.879 --> 07:32.753
ESPECIALLY IF CHIEF MASTERSON
STILL THINKS YOU'RE GUILTY.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.024
( laughs )

07:34.024 --> 07:35.586
GOD, I'M GONNA BE
LIVING WITH A COP

07:35.586 --> 07:36.957
WHO THINKS I'M
A PSYCHOPATHIC MURDERER.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.629
IT'S LIKE THE SETUP
FOR A REALLY,

07:38.629 --> 07:40.791
REALLY DISTURBING SITCOM.

07:40.791 --> 07:42.092
IT'S CERTAINLY GONNA
MAKE IT HARDER

07:42.092 --> 07:43.894
TO KEEP US
A SECRET FROM JO.

07:43.894 --> 07:45.465
WE COULD JUST TELL HER,
YOU KNOW?

07:48.499 --> 07:50.040
WHAT?

07:50.040 --> 07:52.002
YOU DON'T FEEL
A LITTLE BIT GUILTY
KEEPING THIS FROM HER?

07:52.002 --> 07:54.505
WHY SHOULD I FEEL GUILTY?

07:54.505 --> 07:55.946
I DO.

07:55.946 --> 07:57.247
JO'S MY BEST FRIEND.

07:57.247 --> 07:58.879
AND YOU GUYS ARE
DOING PRETTY WELL.

07:58.879 --> 08:03.213
I KNOW, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE SUDDENLY B.F.F.s AGAIN.

08:03.213 --> 08:05.255
WHAT?

08:05.255 --> 08:07.257
I'M SURE THERE'S THINGS
SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME.

08:07.257 --> 08:08.719
I GUESS.

08:08.719 --> 08:10.891
IT JUST SUCKS.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.763
WE CAN'T EVEN ACT
LIKE WE'RE TOGETHER,

08:12.763 --> 08:13.794
EVEN IN FRONT OF JO.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.826
AND IT IS

08:15.826 --> 08:18.228
A CONSTANT CHALLENGE FOR ME
TO KEEP MY HANDS OFF YOU.

08:18.228 --> 08:20.901
THANKS,

08:20.901 --> 08:23.774
BUT I'M SURE
YOU CAN MANAGE.

08:23.774 --> 08:24.835
I DON'T KNOW.

08:26.176 --> 08:27.507
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.612
YOU READY?

08:31.612 --> 08:33.083
YOU HAVEN'T
ANSWERED MY QUESTION.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.845
ARE WE GOING TO
TELL CHIEF MASTERSON?

08:36.917 --> 08:41.191
YEAH, I THINK IT'S TIME WE
PUT ALL OUR CARDS ON THE TABLE.

08:43.754 --> 08:45.195
( dog barks )

08:46.897 --> 08:48.258
SO THIS WAS POSTMARKED--

08:48.258 --> 08:49.900
TWO DAYS BEFORE
REGINA DIED, YEAH.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.632
I DON'T BELIEVE KAREN
WOULD DO ALL THIS.

08:51.632 --> 08:54.034
SEND REGINA THREATENING LETTERS,
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.237
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT
MY MOTHER DID ANY OF THIS.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.538
BUT SOMEONE DID.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.540
SOMEONE OTHER THAN DANNY.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.112
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS
KEPT ALL THIS FROM ME.

09:02.112 --> 09:03.614
Lacey: THAT'S MY FAULT,
CHIEF MASTERSON.

09:03.614 --> 09:05.015
DANNY AND JO
WANTED TO TELL YOU,

09:05.015 --> 09:06.546
BUT I WAS WORRIED

09:06.546 --> 09:09.720
IF PEOPLE FOUND OUT--
IF REGINA'S MOTHER FOUND OUT,

09:09.720 --> 09:10.821
ABOUT IT--

09:10.821 --> 09:12.783
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

09:12.783 --> 09:13.784
CUT LACEY A BREAK, DAD.

09:13.784 --> 09:15.586
I'M NOT HAPPY WITH YOU EITHER.

09:15.586 --> 09:16.957
FINE, THEN BE MAD AT ME,

09:16.957 --> 09:19.259
BUT LACEY WAS JUST
TRYING TO BE A GOOD FRIEND.

09:20.731 --> 09:22.893
LOOK, YOU TOLD ME TO TELL YOU
EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW.

09:23.764 --> 09:24.795
WELL, THIS IS EVERYTHING.

09:26.667 --> 09:27.968
OKAY.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.971
I'LL SET UP THE AIR MATTRESS
IN THE SUNROOM.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.003
- SOUND OKAY?
- YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

09:33.003 --> 09:34.945
THANK YOU, MRS. MASTERSON.
THANK YOU BOTH

09:34.945 --> 09:36.246
FOR LETTING ME
STAY HERE.

09:36.246 --> 09:38.779
YOU REALIZE THIS IS ONLY
TEMPORARY. RIGHT, DANNY?

09:40.250 --> 09:41.982
BUT IF YOU CHARGE MRS. DESAI,

09:41.982 --> 09:43.754
DANNY WILL HAVE TO STAY
HERE LONGER, RIGHT?

09:43.754 --> 09:45.315
WHERE ELSE CAN HE GO?

09:45.315 --> 09:47.788
LEGALLY, HE HAS TO GO
LIVE WITH HIS NEXT OF KIN.

09:47.788 --> 09:48.919
WHAT NEXT OF KIN?

09:50.921 --> 09:52.623
WAIT, YOU MEAN
MY GRANDMOTHER...

09:53.664 --> 09:55.595
IN ARIZONA.

10:06.176 --> 10:09.009
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
ME TO BE HAPPY, RIGHT?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.681
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA BE HAPPY

10:10.681 --> 10:12.913
IF I HAVE TO MOVE TO ARIZONA
AND LEAVE JO

10:12.913 --> 10:15.145
AND-- LOOK, LACEY AND I,

10:15.145 --> 10:17.147
IT'S BECOMING
A LITTLE BIT MORE...

10:18.618 --> 10:20.921
ARIZONA'S BETTER THAN PRISON.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.122
MOTHER, JUST STOP IT.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.725
I DIDN'T KILL REGINA
AND NEITHER DID YOU.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.096
YES, I DID.

10:26.096 --> 10:27.958
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY.

10:27.958 --> 10:30.130
CHIEF MASTERSON THINKS
I'M COVERING FOR YOU

10:30.130 --> 10:31.762
AND HE'S JUST GONNA
COME AFTER YOU.

10:31.762 --> 10:33.133
NO, HE'S NOT.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.236
OKAY, HE HAS NEW INFORMATION
ABOUT THE CASE.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.708
WHAT NEW INFORMATION?

10:37.708 --> 10:38.969
( door opens )

10:38.969 --> 10:41.371
SORRY, AM I INTERRUPTING

10:41.371 --> 10:43.844
A LITTLE MOTHER-SON MOMENT?

10:43.844 --> 10:45.415
NO, I WAS JUST LEAVING.

11:00.190 --> 11:01.932
AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?

11:01.932 --> 11:03.363
I GUESS NOT.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.696
IT TURNS OUT
YOU WERE RIGHT.

11:05.696 --> 11:07.998
VIKRAM AND REGINA
DID HAVE A CONNECTION.

11:07.998 --> 11:10.741
THIS WAS SENT TO REGINA
TWO DAYS BEFORE SHE DIED

11:10.741 --> 11:12.242
FROM AN APARTMENT
IN BRISTOL, CONNECTICUT--

11:12.242 --> 11:14.775
AN APARTMENT
IN VIKRAM'S NAME.

11:16.346 --> 11:18.208
VIKRAM NEVER
WENT TO CONNECTICUT.

11:18.208 --> 11:19.679
WELL, APPARENTLY HE DID.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.681
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHO SENT THIS,

11:21.681 --> 11:22.853
BUT I REALLY DON'T
THINK IT WAS YOU.

11:22.853 --> 11:24.384
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO SENT IT.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.716
I STILL KILLED HER.

11:25.716 --> 11:27.017
KAREN, PLEASE.

11:27.017 --> 11:28.819
I WANT TO SOLVE THIS CASE,
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT

11:28.819 --> 11:30.320
IF YOU DON'T RETRACT
YOUR CONFESSION.

11:45.035 --> 11:46.937
POOR DANNY.

11:46.937 --> 11:48.809
I MEAN, HE'S
BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH

11:48.809 --> 11:51.241
AND NOW HE MIGHT HAVE
TO MOVE AGAIN TO ARIZONA.

11:51.241 --> 11:52.843
LIKE...

11:52.843 --> 11:54.284
MAYBE IT'LL BE EASIER
IF HE LEAVES.

11:55.445 --> 11:57.818
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WITH YOUR FEELINGS FOR HIM

11:57.818 --> 11:58.989
AND THEN HIM CALLING YOU
HIS SIBLING,

11:58.989 --> 12:00.390
IT'S BEEN ROUGH FOR YOU.

12:00.390 --> 12:02.452
I STILL DON'T
WANT TO LOSE HIM.

12:02.452 --> 12:04.224
GOSH!

12:04.224 --> 12:05.756
MRS. DESAI?
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

12:05.756 --> 12:06.927
I COULD HAVE SWORE
SHE WAS COVERING FOR DANNY

12:06.927 --> 12:08.728
WHEN I SAW HER THROW
THAT NECKLACE INTO THE POND.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.001
WAIT, WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:11.001 --> 12:12.933
UH...
( laughs )

12:14.434 --> 12:16.166
( laughs )
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU--

12:16.166 --> 12:18.208
UH, NO, NO--
WH-- SOR--

12:18.208 --> 12:20.440
WHAT I MEANT--
WHAT I MEANT WAS NOT THAT.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.372
IT WAS--
IT WAS DARK.

12:22.372 --> 12:23.513
I SAW ANOTHER--
THERE WAS A NECKLACE.

12:23.513 --> 12:24.815
RICO.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.248
OKAY, LOOK, AFTER FALL FEST,

12:28.248 --> 12:29.519
I WALKED HOME
THROUGH MCNALLY PARK

12:29.519 --> 12:31.151
AND I SAW MRS. DESAI THROW
SOMETHING INTO A POND

12:31.151 --> 12:33.283
THAT LOOKED LIKE A NECKLACE
SO I TOLD YOUR DAD.

12:33.283 --> 12:35.385
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ANY OF THIS?

12:35.385 --> 12:36.386
I DON'T KNOW. I'M SORRY.

12:36.386 --> 12:37.427
I WAS TRYING TO BE
A GOOD FRIEND.

12:37.427 --> 12:38.388
AND I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU CARE ABOUT DANNY.

12:38.388 --> 12:39.389
AND I DIDN'T WANT
YOU TO GET HURT.

12:39.389 --> 12:40.791
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME!

12:40.791 --> 12:42.092
I KNOW
AND I'M SORRY.

12:43.994 --> 12:45.796
FORGIVE ME?

12:45.796 --> 12:49.139
IT'S FINE-- JUST
NO MORE SECRETS OKAY?

12:50.841 --> 12:54.544
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

12:54.544 --> 12:56.506
IF THE POLICE CHARGE
MRS. DESAI FOR MURDER,

12:56.506 --> 12:57.447
THEN DANNY HAS TO SHIP OUT?

13:02.813 --> 13:04.254
IT'LL BE OKAY.
YOU HAVE ME.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.519
PLUS, YOU AND LACEY ARE
ALL BUDDY-BUDDY AGAIN, RIGHT?

13:09.519 --> 13:13.793
IT'S NOT WHAT IT WAS
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.265
IF DANNY LEAVES,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW

13:15.265 --> 13:16.326
IF WE'LL STAY THAT CLOSE.

13:16.326 --> 13:17.968
MAYBE YOU JUST NEED
TO TRY A LITTLE HARDER.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.536
( sighs )

13:28.538 --> 13:31.041
DAD, HI.
YOU GOT IN EARLY.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.582
HELLO, LACEY.
YEAH.

13:32.582 --> 13:34.384
I WAS ABLE TO JUMP ONTO
AN EARLIER FLIGHT.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.248
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT, HONEY?
DID YOU HAVE FUN AT PHOEBE'S?

13:38.248 --> 13:40.020
UH-HUH. YEAH, SURE.
WHERE'S CLARA?

13:40.020 --> 13:42.322
HANGING OUT WITH HER
GYMNASTICS TEAM, APPARENTLY.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.593
GYMNASTICS IS HER LIFE,
SAMUEL.

13:43.593 --> 13:46.296
YEAH, I KNOW. AND THAT
OVER-PRICED COACH IS STILL

13:46.296 --> 13:47.397
COSTING AN ARM AND A LEG.

13:47.397 --> 13:48.428
MITCH IS WORTH
EVERY PENNY.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.860
JUDY, I'M NOT
ARGUING WITH YOU.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.201
I JUST WOULD'VE HOPED
SHE'D COME HOME

13:51.201 --> 13:53.003
TO SEE HER OWN FATHER,
WHO FLEW ACROSS COUNTRY

13:53.003 --> 13:54.404
- FOR HER BIRTHDAY.
- WELL, WE CAN'T ALL
DROP EVERYTHING

13:54.404 --> 13:55.966
WHEN YOU DECIDE TO SHOW UP.

13:55.966 --> 13:57.868
YOU'LL SEE HER TOMORROW
AT THE PARTY.

13:57.868 --> 13:59.239
JUST LET IT BE.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.443
SO CATCH ME UP
ON YOU, LACEY.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.575
I KNOW IT'S BEEN A HARD MONTH
WITH ALL THAT HAPPENED.

14:05.575 --> 14:07.017
I'M OKAY, DAD.
THANKS.

14:07.017 --> 14:08.578
OKAY.

14:08.578 --> 14:10.420
GOOD.

14:10.420 --> 14:11.521
SO WHAT ABOUT
DANNY DESAI?

14:11.521 --> 14:12.582
OH, PLEASE DON'T START.

14:12.582 --> 14:15.155
DAD, TRUST ME.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.087
- DANNY WON'T BE AN ISSUE.
- Judy: EXACTLY.

14:17.087 --> 14:19.329
SHE'S KEEPING HER
DISTANCE FROM HIM.

14:19.329 --> 14:22.562
PLEASE DO NOT SHOW UP
AND TELL ME HOW TO PARENT.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.134
JUDY, DON'T GET
SO DEFENSIVE.

14:24.134 --> 14:25.595
- I AM NOT BEING DEFENSIVE.
- I AM ONLY MAKING SUGGESTIONS.

14:25.595 --> 14:26.897
- YOU ARE GETTING DEFENSIVE!
- YOU WALKED IN THE DOOR

14:26.897 --> 14:28.298
WHEN NOBODY WAS EXPECTING YOU--

14:28.298 --> 14:30.100
Sam: THEY WERE EXPECTING ME.
I AM THEIR FATHER.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.201
Judy: SAMUEL,
I WILL NOT LET YOU DO IT.

14:31.201 --> 14:32.542
I WENT BACK
THROUGH THE RECORDS

14:32.542 --> 14:34.104
OF VIKRAM DESAI'S ESTATE.

14:34.104 --> 14:35.946
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT
AN APARTMENT IN BRISTOL,
CONNECTICUT.

14:35.946 --> 14:37.107
WHICH MEANS WE CAN'T
CONFIRM OR DENY

14:37.107 --> 14:38.308
THAT KAREN KNEW ABOUT IT.

14:38.308 --> 14:39.509
COME ON, WHO ELSE
COULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT?

14:39.509 --> 14:40.880
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.152
AND WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

14:42.152 --> 14:43.513
YOU WANT ME TO DIG
MORE INTO ALL THIS?

14:43.513 --> 14:44.454
YES. GO TO BRISTOL.

14:44.454 --> 14:46.116
SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND OUT
ABOUT THAT APARTMENT,

14:46.116 --> 14:47.988
WHAT VIKRAM WAS DOING THERE,
AND WHO VISITED HIM.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.089
AND WHAT ABOUT KAREN?

14:49.089 --> 14:51.561
ARE YOU PREPARED TO CALL
THE D.A. TOMORROW?

14:51.561 --> 14:52.562
I WANT AS MANY FACTS
AS POSSIBLE

14:52.562 --> 14:54.394
BEFORE I CROSS THAT BRIDGE,
OKAY?

14:54.394 --> 14:56.066
GOT IT.

15:01.171 --> 15:03.073
Lacey: RICO'S SURE
IT WAS THAT NECKLACE?

15:03.073 --> 15:04.434
SURE ENOUGH
TO TELL MY DAD.

15:04.434 --> 15:07.107
DANNY, IF YOUR MOM REALLY
DID HAVE THE NECKLACE, THEN--

15:07.107 --> 15:08.478
HER CONFESSION'S LEGIT.

15:08.478 --> 15:11.541
I JUST...

15:11.541 --> 15:13.043
THE IDEA
OF LEAVING YOU TWO,

15:13.043 --> 15:14.484
IT'S NOT FAIR.

15:19.149 --> 15:20.590
I NEED TO WALK AROUND
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

15:20.590 --> 15:22.422
YOU WANT COMPANY?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.624
I THINK I JUST NEED TO BE ALONE.
THANK YOU.

15:26.296 --> 15:28.528
JO, I WILL SEE YOU
AT HOME.

15:34.264 --> 15:36.466
I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING
WE COULD DO FOR HIM.

15:36.466 --> 15:38.238
I GUESS IT'S UP
TO YOUR DAD NOW.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.510
HOW'D IT GO WITH
YOUR DAD TODAY?

15:42.572 --> 15:44.614
OKAY.

15:44.614 --> 15:45.675
GOD, THE LAST THING
I WANT TO DO

15:45.675 --> 15:47.417
IS STAND AROUND LISTENING
TO MY PARENTS ARGUE

15:47.417 --> 15:49.179
AT A 13-YEAR-OLD'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

15:49.179 --> 15:51.321
SO THEY STILL ARGUE A LOT?

15:52.482 --> 15:54.024
SORRY, I DON'T MEAN TO PRY.

15:54.024 --> 15:57.127
IT'S OKAY, YEAH.
THEY STILL ARGUE LIKE ALWAYS

15:57.127 --> 16:00.060
OVER ME AND CLARA--

16:00.060 --> 16:01.591
OUR LIVES, OUR CHOICES.

16:01.591 --> 16:03.963
WELL, I COULD COME...

16:04.964 --> 16:06.636
TO THE PARTY TOMORROW...

16:06.636 --> 16:08.598
IF YOU WANTED,
FOR LIKE MORAL SUPPORT.

16:08.598 --> 16:10.270
I HAVEN'T SEEN CLARA
IN FOREVER

16:10.270 --> 16:12.102
AND YOUR DAD
DID ALWAYS LIKE ME.

16:13.703 --> 16:15.445
LET ME DO THIS FOR YOU.

16:15.445 --> 16:16.476
OKAY?

16:18.108 --> 16:19.609
OKAY, THANK YOU.

16:21.611 --> 16:23.153
GOOD MORNING.
YOU'RE UP EARLY, SIR.

16:23.153 --> 16:25.715
A LOT TO DO TODAY, DANNY.

16:25.715 --> 16:28.188
RIGHT.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.491
YOU FIND ANYTHING OUT ABOUT
THE CASH IN THE APARTMENT?

16:31.491 --> 16:34.164
NOT YET.

16:34.164 --> 16:35.765
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

16:35.765 --> 16:40.670
SO RICO SAW MY MOTHER
TOSS AWAY THE NECKLACE, HUH?

16:42.432 --> 16:44.034
HE TOLD JO YESTERDAY.

16:44.034 --> 16:47.607
WE FOUND THE NECKLACE
NEAR WHERE RICO SAW HER.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.579
SHE CLAIMED SHE
TOOK IT FROM REGINA.

16:49.579 --> 16:51.581
SHE'S LYING.

16:51.581 --> 16:52.742
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

16:54.744 --> 16:57.217
BECAUSE...

16:58.618 --> 16:59.749
SHE TOOK IT FROM ME.

17:00.790 --> 17:02.752
I HAD THE NECKLACE.

17:11.101 --> 17:12.302
Danny:
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

17:14.664 --> 17:16.766
THAT DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT
I DECIDE TO BELIEVE YOU.

17:16.766 --> 17:20.340
SOMEONE LEFT THE NECKLACE
IN YOUR LOCKER. WHY?

17:20.340 --> 17:22.272
PROBABLY TO SET ME UP.

17:23.473 --> 17:25.075
I'M JUST TELLING
YOU THE TRUTH.

17:25.075 --> 17:26.176
I HOPE SO.

17:26.176 --> 17:28.778
SIR, YOU KNOW
I DIDN'T DO THIS.

17:28.778 --> 17:31.050
I DIDN'T SEND
THAT CASH AND NOTE.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.452
SOMEONE ELSE
HAS TO BE INVOLVED.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.723
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU WAITED THIS LONG

17:33.723 --> 17:35.525
TO TELL ME
ABOUT THE NECKLACE?

17:35.525 --> 17:37.587
BECAUSE YOU THINK
THAT CASH AND NOTE

17:37.587 --> 17:38.658
LETS YOU OFF THE HOOK?

17:38.658 --> 17:41.631
NO, BUT I THINK IT HELPS.

17:41.631 --> 17:43.533
MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T
WANT TO MOVE TO ARIZONA.

17:45.635 --> 17:48.268
YOU WERE GONNA LET YOUR MOM
TAKE THE FALL, WEREN'T YOU?

17:52.372 --> 17:53.703
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

17:53.703 --> 17:55.745
SHE MOST LIKELY WILL ANYWAY.

17:55.745 --> 17:58.278
UNLESS WE CAN PROVE

17:58.278 --> 17:59.679
THAT SHE COULDN'T
HAVE KILLED REGINA.

18:02.852 --> 18:04.214
SHE TOLD ME A WHILE BACK

18:04.214 --> 18:06.286
THAT SHE WAS IN BED
ASLEEP THAT NIGHT.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.618
IF I CAN PROVE
SHE WASN'T ASLEEP...

18:08.618 --> 18:11.461
WE WOULD NEED
TANGIBLE EVIDENCE

18:11.461 --> 18:13.863
THAT SHE WAS HOME
WHEN REGINA WAS KILLED,

18:13.863 --> 18:16.726
PROOF THAT SHE WAS ON
A LANDLINE OR A COMPUTER.

18:16.726 --> 18:18.298
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES

18:18.298 --> 18:19.869
SHE LIKES TO STAY UP LATE
AND SHOP ONLINE.

18:19.869 --> 18:22.632
IF WE CAN PROVE SHE WAS
ONLINE THAT NIGHT AT HOME,

18:22.632 --> 18:23.673
THEN SHE'S IN THE CLEAR.

18:24.674 --> 18:26.176
CAN YOU GET ON
TO HER COMPUTER?

18:34.544 --> 18:37.217
I HAD TO COME TALK TO YOU.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.588
I DIDN'T SLEEP AT ALL
LAST NIGHT.

18:38.588 --> 18:40.620
WELL, THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.653
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE, TESS.

18:45.495 --> 18:47.827
I CHECKED.
IT'S FINE.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.462
KYLE TOLD ME YOU
HAVEN'T BEEN

18:52.462 --> 18:53.663
OFFICIALLY CHARGED
WITH ANYTHING.

18:53.663 --> 18:55.665
NOT YET.

18:55.665 --> 18:58.738
( laughs )
COME ON.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.571
KAREN, WE BOTH KNOW
YOU'RE NOT A KILLER.

19:01.571 --> 19:04.844
YEAH, WELL, YOU DON'T
KNOW ME THAT WELL.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.516
YES, I DO.

19:06.516 --> 19:08.718
I KNOW YOU'RE A MOTHER
WHO LOVES HER SON.

19:08.718 --> 19:10.280
AND DANNY KNOWS THAT TOO.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.751
I DON'T THINK SO.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.683
DANNY HASN'T KNOWN THAT
FOR A LONG TIME.

19:13.683 --> 19:15.485
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:15.485 --> 19:16.756
( laughing )

19:16.756 --> 19:18.488
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE DOLL JO MADE.

19:18.488 --> 19:21.531
IT HAD ITS HAIR UP IN
THIS POUFY '80s HAIRSTYLE.

19:21.531 --> 19:22.732
AWW, THAT'S ADORABLE.

19:22.732 --> 19:25.635
MOTHER, CAN JO AND I
HAVE SOME POPSICLES?

19:25.635 --> 19:27.467
YES, ONE EACH THOUGH.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.670
HEY, DANNY, JO TOLD
ME ABOUT THE ROCKET
YOU AND YOUR DAD MADE.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.542
OH, YEAH.
IT'S AN ESTES SCREAMING EAGLE

19:32.542 --> 19:33.743
WITH A B4-4 ENGINE.

19:33.743 --> 19:35.805
THERE'S A LAUNCH CONTEST
TOMORROW AT MCNALLY PARK.

19:35.805 --> 19:37.747
SOUNDS COOL.

19:37.747 --> 19:38.648
HEY, KAREN, ARE YOU GOING?

19:38.648 --> 19:41.451
GOD, NO. VIKRAM IS.

19:42.752 --> 19:44.454
I WISH I HAD A DAUGHTER, TESS.

19:44.454 --> 19:46.456
I MEAN, GIRL STUFF IS JUST
SO MUCH MORE FUN.

19:46.456 --> 19:48.588
ROCKETS AND ENGINES--
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

19:48.588 --> 19:50.189
ABOUT THAT STUFF.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.691
IT'S FATHER-SON STUFF.
AND I DON'T GET IT.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.268
"I WISH I HAD A DAUGHTER"?

19:58.268 --> 19:59.629
- ( door closes )
- ( laughs )

19:59.629 --> 20:00.770
HE KNOWS I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.305
THAT WAS SIX YEARS AGO.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.736
AND I WAS WRONG.

20:06.736 --> 20:09.609
I'M SURE DANNY BARELY NOTICED
THAT YOU SAID THAT.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.742
TRUST ME.
HE NOTICED.

20:12.742 --> 20:16.646
YOU HUNGRY?

20:16.646 --> 20:19.419
YOU WANT SOME FOOD?

20:19.419 --> 20:22.252
I'M GONNA GO
GET YOU SOME FOOD.

20:24.794 --> 20:28.728
( door opens, closes )

20:29.729 --> 20:31.961
( rock music playing )

20:33.002 --> 20:34.964
- HEY.
- HEY.

20:34.964 --> 20:36.706
HOW'S DANNY?

20:36.706 --> 20:38.508
I DON'T KNOW.
HE WAS GONE WHEN I WOKE UP.

20:38.508 --> 20:40.810
HE TEXTED TO SAY HE WAS
GOING TO VISIT HIS MOM.

20:40.810 --> 20:43.513
HOW IS EVERYTHING HERE?

20:43.513 --> 20:44.814
GREAT.

20:44.814 --> 20:46.576
MY PARENTS ONLY
HAD TWO ARGUMENTS

20:46.576 --> 20:48.247
BEFORE BREAKFAST.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.779
EXCUSE ME.
JO!

20:49.779 --> 20:51.421
I WAS SO EXCITED
WHEN LACEY

20:51.421 --> 20:52.422
TOLD ME YOU WERE COMING.

20:52.422 --> 20:54.253
YEAH, I JUST WANTED TO COME

20:54.253 --> 20:55.455
AND WISH CLARA
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.457
THAT'S SWEET.
DO YOU REMEMBER MITCH,

20:57.457 --> 20:58.828
CLARA'S GYMNASTICS COACH?

20:58.828 --> 21:01.591
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN YEARS.

21:01.591 --> 21:02.932
YOU AND LACEY USED
TO BE INSEPARABLE.

21:02.932 --> 21:05.635
Sam: IS THAT JO MASTERSON
I SEE?

21:05.635 --> 21:07.637
MR. PORTER, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

21:07.637 --> 21:08.898
- YOU TOO.
- HI.

21:08.898 --> 21:10.039
YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP.

21:10.039 --> 21:11.671
HELLO, MITCH.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.003
OVERCHARGING MY EX-WIFE
FOR GYMNASTICS LESSONS

21:14.003 --> 21:16.446
AND EATING THE FREE FOOD--
WELL PLAYED.

21:16.446 --> 21:18.878
CHARMING AS EVER, SAMUEL.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.710
NICE OF YOU TO
MAKE THE TRIP.

21:23.012 --> 21:24.514
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST SAID THAT.

21:24.514 --> 21:26.586
COME ON, STOP IT.
I WAS JUST JOKING AROUND.

21:26.586 --> 21:27.717
CAN WE PLEASE
NOT DO THIS NOW?

21:29.719 --> 21:31.991
MR. PORTER, DO YOU REMEMBER

21:31.991 --> 21:34.524
THAT EASTER-EGG HUNT
YOU GUYS THREW YEARS AGO?

21:34.524 --> 21:36.065
WELL, WHICH ONE?
WE HOSTED A FEW.

21:36.065 --> 21:38.398
OH, YOU KNOW THE ONE.
UM...

21:38.398 --> 21:40.370
YOU DRESSED UP AS
THE EASTER BUNNY.

21:40.370 --> 21:42.372
AND I THINK HALFWAY
THROUGH YOU--

21:42.372 --> 21:45.505
WAIT, DAD, DIDN'T YOU PASS OUT
FROM HEAT EXHAUSTION?

21:45.505 --> 21:47.477
IT'S BECAUSE THE COSTUME
WASN'T VENTILATED.

21:47.477 --> 21:49.078
THE KIDS WERE TERRIFIED.

21:49.078 --> 21:51.080
THEY THOUGHT THAT
THE EASTER BUNNY WAS DEAD.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.582
( all laugh )

21:52.582 --> 21:53.743
EXCUSE US.

21:56.746 --> 21:58.087
WOW.

21:58.087 --> 22:00.490
- YOU'RE GOOD.
- OH, I KNOW.

22:00.490 --> 22:02.592
NOW WHERE IS
THE BIRTHDAY GIRL?

22:02.592 --> 22:04.624
SOMEWHERE OVER THERE
I THINK.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.496
I'M GONNA CALL DANNY,
CHECK UP ON HIM.

22:06.496 --> 22:07.627
GOOD IDEA.

22:13.603 --> 22:15.805
( buzzing )

22:19.338 --> 22:21.471
OKAY, SO YOU WANT
TO DO THE HONORS?

22:21.471 --> 22:23.373
I THINK YOU'D BETTER.

22:23.373 --> 22:24.514
CHECK THE BROWSER HISTORY.

22:24.514 --> 22:25.945
ANY ACTIVITY BETWEEN
2:00 AND 3:00 AM

22:25.945 --> 22:27.076
THE NIGHT REGINA DIED?

22:30.780 --> 22:32.452
( laughs )

22:32.452 --> 22:35.084
UH, IT'S MORBID, HUH?

22:35.084 --> 22:37.356
MY MOTHER HAS
TROUBLE LETTING GO.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.058
I CAN SEE THAT.

22:39.058 --> 22:41.360
I NOTICED SHE STILL
WEARS HER WEDDING RING.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.732
YEAH.

22:42.732 --> 22:44.063
I THINK THERE'S A PART OF HER

22:44.063 --> 22:47.637
THAT HOPES THAT
HE'S ON SOME ISLAND SOMEWHERE

22:47.637 --> 22:48.868
SIPPING MAI TAIS.

22:52.602 --> 22:54.103
Kyle: MUST BE HARD NOT
HAVING YOUR DAD AROUND.

22:55.605 --> 22:57.947
YOU AND YOUR MOM ALWAYS
HAVE A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP?

22:57.947 --> 22:59.749
( typing )

22:59.749 --> 23:02.752
WELL, WHAT SHE'S DOING NOW,
AS A PARENT, I GET IT.

23:02.752 --> 23:03.813
YEAH, WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE

23:03.813 --> 23:05.384
YOU HAVE A COUPLE
THINGS IN COMMON.

23:06.586 --> 23:07.787
YOU BOTH THINK I'M GUILTY.

23:07.787 --> 23:10.620
( typing )

23:10.620 --> 23:11.861
Danny: NO ACTIVITY.

23:11.861 --> 23:13.793
CHECK THE TRASH BIN.

23:31.611 --> 23:32.812
Jo: YOU TALK TO DANNY?

23:32.812 --> 23:34.183
NO, HE DIDN'T PICK UP.

23:34.183 --> 23:35.845
HE'S PROBABLY JUST
BUSY WITH HIS MOM.

23:37.817 --> 23:40.890
LACEY, IF DANNY
DOES END UP LEAVING,

23:40.890 --> 23:42.822
I HOPE THAT YOU AND I
CAN STAY FRIENDS.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.423
YOU KNOW?

23:44.423 --> 23:45.825
YEAH, I'D LIKE THAT.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.459
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS OUT.
CAN YOU GRAB MORE NAPKINS?

23:49.459 --> 23:50.800
THEY'RE IN THE PANTRY.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.843
( gasps )

24:20.930 --> 24:23.032
Sam: MITCH, MAY I HAVE A MOMENT
ALONE WITH JO, PLEASE?

24:25.094 --> 24:27.136
( door opens )

24:27.136 --> 24:28.197
( door closes )

24:28.197 --> 24:30.099
I'M SORRY YOU HAD
TO WITNESS THAT.

24:30.099 --> 24:33.102
MITCH AND I--

24:33.102 --> 24:35.805
WELL, IT'S
FAIRLY COMPLICATED.

24:35.805 --> 24:39.208
WAIT, SO WERE
YOU AND MITCH--

24:39.208 --> 24:41.581
WAS THAT
GOING ON BEFORE...

24:41.581 --> 24:43.082
WHEN YOU WERE STILL
MARRIED TO MRS. PORTER?

24:43.082 --> 24:45.585
JO, PLEASE,
THIS IS MY PRIVATE LIFE.

24:45.585 --> 24:47.987
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME
THAT IT STAY PRIVATE.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.088
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

24:49.088 --> 24:51.020
OKAY, SO MRS. PORTER
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW

24:51.020 --> 24:52.992
THAT YOU'RE GAY.
DOES LACEY?

24:55.595 --> 24:58.067
I HAVE MY LIFE IN SEATTLE.
AND I HAVE MY FAMILY HERE.

24:58.067 --> 25:01.000
TRUST ME.
IT'S MUCH EASIER THAT WAY.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.532
MAYBE FOR YOU.

25:02.532 --> 25:04.874
BUT LACEY--

25:04.874 --> 25:07.106
SHE ALWAYS FELT LIKE
THE DIVORCE WAS BECAUSE OF HER.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.278
YOU KNOW?

25:09.278 --> 25:12.081
LACEY LOVES YOU.

25:12.081 --> 25:16.986
SHE WOULD LOVE YOU
NO MATTER WHAT.

25:16.986 --> 25:18.017
SHOULDN'T YOU
BE HONEST WITH HER?

25:20.289 --> 25:22.992
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T
TELL LACEY ANY OF THIS.

25:22.992 --> 25:25.094
OKAY?

25:31.861 --> 25:33.132
SO YOU HAD NO CLUE?

25:33.132 --> 25:35.805
WHAT, THAT MY MOTHER
AND PRINCIPAL TANG

25:35.805 --> 25:37.036
WERE, UH...

25:37.036 --> 25:38.608
INTIMATE?
NO, I DID NOT.

25:38.608 --> 25:40.640
YOU KNOW THOSE PHOTOS
DON'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT--

25:40.640 --> 25:42.141
MAYBE LET'S JUST
NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.542
OKAY?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.014
YEAH, OKAY.
FAIR ENOUGH.

25:45.014 --> 25:46.315
YOU'RE GONNA FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT, RIGHT?

25:46.315 --> 25:48.818
A WAY OF STOPPING MY MOTHER
FROM DOING THIS?

25:48.818 --> 25:50.950
I HOPE SO.

25:58.628 --> 26:00.159
( sighs )

26:07.597 --> 26:09.939
Karen: HEY, DANNY.
WHAT ARE YOU PLAYING?

26:09.939 --> 26:12.071
A GAME.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.073
I CAN SEE THAT.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.746
CAN YOU PUT IT DOWN
FOR A SECOND, PLEASE?

26:22.912 --> 26:24.283
HONEY, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID EARLIER

26:24.283 --> 26:25.815
WHEN TESS AND JO
WERE HERE

26:25.815 --> 26:27.657
ABOUT WISHING
I HAD A DAUGHTER?

26:28.958 --> 26:30.760
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T MEAN THAT,
RIGHT?

26:33.122 --> 26:35.124
WELL, I'M SORRY
IF I HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

26:35.124 --> 26:36.796
OKAY?

26:41.170 --> 26:42.171
YOU MEANT IT.

26:42.171 --> 26:44.774
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

26:47.907 --> 26:49.979
YOU MEANT IT.

26:49.979 --> 26:51.811
YOU DON'T WANT ME.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.213
YOU NEVER HAVE WANTED ME.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.215
WHAT A HORRIBLE THING
TO SAY TO YOUR MOTHER.

26:56.215 --> 26:59.048
OF COURSE I WANT YOU.
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.

26:59.048 --> 27:01.190
NO, YOU DON'T.

27:01.190 --> 27:02.722
YOU NEVER HAVE.

27:02.722 --> 27:05.094
ALL YOU LOVE
IS YOURSELF,

27:05.094 --> 27:08.758
AND YOUR FRIENDS
AND YOUR PARTIES--

27:08.758 --> 27:10.830
STOP IT, DANNY.
STOP IT!

27:10.830 --> 27:13.032
YOU'RE AN UNGRATEFUL
LITTLE BRAT.

27:15.104 --> 27:18.167
- ( door opens )
- Tess: KAREN?

27:18.167 --> 27:20.239
KAREN.

27:20.239 --> 27:23.142
HEY, I BROUGHT
YOU SOME FOOD.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.643
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.175
COME ON, KAREN.
YOU HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING.

27:28.377 --> 27:31.080
I'D LIKE YOU TO LEAVE NOW,
PLEASE.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.052
NO, I'M NOT LEAVING
UNTIL YOU TELL ME--

27:33.052 --> 27:34.123
I'M NOT CHANGING MY MIND.

27:49.298 --> 27:52.001
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN
TO SEE ME, PRINCIPAL TANG.

27:52.001 --> 27:53.072
OF COURSE.

27:53.072 --> 27:54.844
I GET A CALL TO MEET
ON A WEEKEND,

27:54.844 --> 27:56.675
I KNOW IT MUST BE URGENT.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.078
SO WHAT'S UP, DANNY?

28:00.780 --> 28:03.853
OH, THIS IS AN ADORABLE FAMILY
YOU GOT THERE, PRINCIPAL TANG.

28:03.853 --> 28:05.114
THANK YOU.

28:05.114 --> 28:07.116
YEAH, IT WOULD SUCK

28:07.116 --> 28:09.388
IF THEY FOUND OUT HOW MUCH OF
A PERVERT YOU REALLY ARE, HUH?

28:09.388 --> 28:12.722
EXCUSE ME, DANNY, BUT--

28:12.722 --> 28:14.463
I FOUND THE PHOTOS
YOU SENT MY MOTHER...

28:14.463 --> 28:16.025
ON HER COMPUTER.

28:16.025 --> 28:17.196
KAREN SAVED THEM?

28:17.196 --> 28:18.367
THEY'RE IN THE TRASH CAN.

28:19.328 --> 28:20.900
OH.

28:20.900 --> 28:24.033
WHERE WERE YOU THE NIGHT
REGINA CRANE WAS KILLED?

28:24.033 --> 28:27.006
I WAS HOME WITH MY FAMILY
ASLEEP.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.178
DANNY, PLEASE.
I LOVE MY WIFE.

28:29.178 --> 28:30.910
AND THIS COMING OUT PUBLICLY,

28:30.910 --> 28:32.882
WELL, IT WOULD HURT
MY FAMILY A LOT.

28:32.882 --> 28:34.143
I WON'T TELL ANYONE, SIR.

28:34.143 --> 28:36.085
BUT...

28:36.085 --> 28:38.087
I NEED YOU TO TELL THE POLICE

28:38.087 --> 28:39.718
THAT YOU WERE WITH
MY MOTHER THAT NIGHT.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.191
WHY, DANNY?

28:42.191 --> 28:43.152
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

28:47.026 --> 28:49.258
DID KAREN EVER SAY

28:49.258 --> 28:53.162
HOW YOU GOT INTO
GREEN GROVE HIGH?

28:53.162 --> 28:55.104
NO, SHE WASN'T SPECIFIC.

28:55.104 --> 28:57.036
THE SCHOOL BOARD
WAS UNEASY,

28:57.036 --> 29:01.240
BUT I WORKED VERY HARD
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN FOR HER.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.742
AND AFTER THAT FIGHT
WITH ARCHIE YATES,

29:03.742 --> 29:05.945
DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU WEREN'T
EXPELLED IMMEDIATELY?

29:05.945 --> 29:08.918
SO YOU TWO HAD
AN ARRANGEMENT?

29:08.918 --> 29:12.221
I LIKE TO THINK OF IT
MORE AS AN UNDERSTANDING.

29:12.221 --> 29:14.423
YOUR MOM IS A VERY

29:14.423 --> 29:18.127
EXCITING, BEAUTIFUL WOMAN...

29:19.088 --> 29:20.459
WITH EXCEPTIONAL HAIR.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.832
WE ENDED IT
A FEW WEEKS AGO...

29:22.832 --> 29:24.133
MUTUALLY.

29:24.133 --> 29:25.764
BUT I STILL CARE FOR HER.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.496
AND SINCE I KNOW
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR HER,

29:27.496 --> 29:30.269
I'M TRYING TO KEEP YOU HERE.
BUT IT ISN'T EASY.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.101
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

29:32.101 --> 29:34.173
THERE ARE RUMORS FLOATING AROUND

29:34.173 --> 29:35.544
THAT YOU LEFT THE SOCCER TEAM

29:35.544 --> 29:37.146
BECAUSE YOU POISONED
ANOTHER PLAYER.

29:37.146 --> 29:39.378
NOPE.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.851
I JUST LEFT BECAUSE...

29:41.851 --> 29:43.252
PERSONAL REASONS.

29:43.252 --> 29:45.384
THAT'S WHAT I KEEP
SAYING TO PEOPLE.

29:46.555 --> 29:48.057
AND I'LL KEEP SAYING IT

29:48.057 --> 29:50.319
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
YOUR MOUTH SHUT

29:50.319 --> 29:51.861
ABOUT THOSE PHOTOS.

29:52.862 --> 29:54.123
GOT IT?

30:00.970 --> 30:03.002
( chattering )

30:07.006 --> 30:09.208
HEY.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.910
HAVING FUN?

30:10.910 --> 30:12.942
UH-HUH.

30:12.942 --> 30:14.143
HOW IS EVERYTHING GOING?

30:14.143 --> 30:16.815
HONESTLY, STRANGELY AMAZING.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.817
I WAS JUST WITH MY PARENTS.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.250
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN MY DAD
ACT THIS SWEET TOWARD MY MOM

30:21.250 --> 30:23.452
IN LIKE... FOREVER.

30:23.452 --> 30:25.154
EVEN CLARA NOTICED.

30:25.154 --> 30:29.098
YOU WORK SOME SORT OF CRAZY,
VOODOO, HAPPINESS MAGIC.

30:29.098 --> 30:30.860
NO, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

30:30.860 --> 30:32.261
YOU KIND OF DID, JO.

30:33.863 --> 30:36.105
IT REALLY MEANS A LOT
TO ME THAT YOU CAME TODAY.

30:36.105 --> 30:39.238
PHOEBE AND SARITA, THEY DON'T
GET MY FAMILY LIKE YOU DO.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.839
I MEAN, I JUST--

30:40.839 --> 30:42.571
THANK YOU, OKAY?

30:42.571 --> 30:44.874
OKAY.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.580
JO, I SHOULD
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

30:51.580 --> 30:55.925
IT'S ABOUT DANNY AND--

30:55.925 --> 30:57.126
YOUR DAD IS GAY.

30:57.126 --> 30:59.058
( laughs )

31:01.530 --> 31:03.132
MY DAD'S WHAT?

31:05.394 --> 31:07.897
I SAW HIM IN THE PANTRY

31:07.897 --> 31:09.068
WITH THE GYMNASTICS COACH.

31:10.339 --> 31:11.600
UM...

31:11.600 --> 31:13.642
MITCH-- HE WAS MITCHING--

31:13.642 --> 31:15.244
( chuckles nervously )

31:15.244 --> 31:17.346
HE'S KISSING MITCH...

31:18.577 --> 31:20.579
WITH HIS MOUTH...

31:20.579 --> 31:22.081
ON HIS MOUTH.

31:23.112 --> 31:24.453
WH--

31:24.453 --> 31:26.015
I'M SORRY TO BLURT
ALL THIS OUT AT YOU, LACEY.

31:26.015 --> 31:27.957
I JUST THOUGHT THAT MAYBE...

31:27.957 --> 31:29.919
YOU NEEDED TO KNOW.

31:29.919 --> 31:32.161
ARE YOU OKAY?

31:37.166 --> 31:39.068
( sighs )

31:43.072 --> 31:45.104
HUH, DANNY?

31:45.104 --> 31:47.476
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING AT SCHOOL ON A SUNDAY?

31:47.476 --> 31:49.238
I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

31:49.238 --> 31:50.639
UH, MATHLETE PRACTICE.

31:52.581 --> 31:53.983
HEY, I KNOW YOU MUST BE
GOING THROUGH A LOT

31:53.983 --> 31:55.684
WITH YOUR MOM
AND HER CONFESSION,

31:57.046 --> 31:58.047
AND, LIKE, ARIZONA.

32:00.289 --> 32:02.121
ARIZONA'S NOT
SO BAD THOUGH.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.592
RIGHT? I MEAN,
THEY HAVE LIKE--

32:06.495 --> 32:07.526
UM...

32:07.526 --> 32:09.228
UH, CACTI.

32:09.228 --> 32:11.460
I MEAN, THEY'RE COOL.
YOU KNOW,

32:11.460 --> 32:13.963
SHARP AND POINTY
AND THEY HAVE WATER IN THEM.

32:13.963 --> 32:15.504
I GUESS THAT'S TRUE.

32:19.038 --> 32:21.070
JO TOLD ME THAT
YOU SAW MY MOTHER

32:21.070 --> 32:22.111
THROW AWAY THAT NECKLACE.

32:23.172 --> 32:24.343
IS THAT WHY YOU'VE
BEEN ACTING

32:24.343 --> 32:25.474
SO WEIRD
TOWARDS ME LATELY?

32:28.447 --> 32:29.979
HUH.

32:29.979 --> 32:30.980
IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

32:30.980 --> 32:32.481
JO'S SORT OF MAD AT ME

32:32.481 --> 32:33.682
FOR THE WHOLE
NOT-TELLING-HER THING.

32:33.682 --> 32:36.625
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

32:36.625 --> 32:37.726
SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH
YOU CARE ABOUT HER.

32:39.428 --> 32:42.191
I GUESS SHE KINDA DOES.

32:42.191 --> 32:44.733
OKAY, PLEASE

32:44.733 --> 32:47.336
DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT
WHAT I TOLD YOU THE OTHER NIGHT.

32:47.336 --> 32:48.637
I WAS WASTED.

32:48.637 --> 32:49.598
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
LANGUAGE I WAS SPEAKING.

32:49.598 --> 32:52.371
YOU SEEMED PRETTY LUCID,
BUT I WON'T TELL HER.

32:52.371 --> 32:54.073
I PROMISE.

32:56.275 --> 32:57.576
YOU KNOW WHAT
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS

32:57.576 --> 32:58.707
WHEN I SAW YOUR MOM
THROW THAT?

32:58.707 --> 33:00.149
"HOLY CRAP."

33:00.149 --> 33:02.581
OKAY, UH, THE SECOND THING.

33:02.581 --> 33:05.354
SHE MUST LOVE YOU A LOT

33:05.354 --> 33:06.985
TO BREAK THE LAW.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.618
I WONDER IF MY MOM
WOULD DO THE SAME FOR ME.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.695
( guests chattering )

33:19.668 --> 33:23.332
LET ME GUESS.
STRAWBERRY, RIGHT?

33:23.332 --> 33:25.574
CLARA IS NOTHING
IF NOT CONSISTENT.

33:25.574 --> 33:27.636
ARE YOU GAY?

33:29.578 --> 33:31.740
JO SAID SHE SAW
YOU WITH MITCH.

33:31.740 --> 33:34.213
WELL, JO HAS A VERY
ACTIVE IMAGINATION.

33:34.213 --> 33:35.614
SO SHE'S LYING?

33:35.614 --> 33:38.147
LACEY, I WAS MARRIED
TO YOUR MOTHER

33:38.147 --> 33:39.388
FOR 14 YEARS.

33:41.390 --> 33:42.491
( footsteps approaching )

33:42.491 --> 33:45.294
CAKE, LACE.
PEOPLE WANT CAKE.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.498
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

33:52.401 --> 33:53.562
JUDY, WE NEED TO TALK.

33:53.562 --> 33:55.664
I'VE GOT 40 GUESTS OUTSIDE.

33:55.664 --> 33:57.166
MOM, JUST GO
TALK TO HIM, OKAY?

34:07.446 --> 34:09.748
LACEY, ARE YOU--

34:09.748 --> 34:11.480
I'M FINE.
I JUST NEED TO DO THE CAKE.

34:16.185 --> 34:17.756
Eddie: THE APARTMENT WAS
IN VIKRAM DESAI'S NAME,

34:17.756 --> 34:20.459
BUT THE RENT WAS BEING PAID
OUT OF A LOCAL BANK ACCOUNT,

34:20.459 --> 34:21.530
WHICH IS WHY
NO ONE KNEW ABOUT IT.

34:21.530 --> 34:22.831
SO VIKRAM HAD A SEPARATE,
SECRET ACCOUNT

34:22.831 --> 34:24.133
IN BRISTOL, CONNECTICUT.

34:24.133 --> 34:25.464
IT WASN'T A PERSONAL ACCOUNT.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.296
IT WAS A BUSINESS ACCOUNT
FOR A COMPANY CALLED

34:27.296 --> 34:28.697
MARNA, INC.

34:28.697 --> 34:30.139
MARNA?

34:30.139 --> 34:31.170
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE STRANGEST PART?

34:31.170 --> 34:32.671
- YOU GOT STRANGER?
- TWO DAYS

34:32.671 --> 34:34.173
BEFORE REGINA CRANE
WAS MURDERED,

34:34.173 --> 34:36.745
$2,000 WAS WITHDRAWN
FROM THAT ACCOUNT.

34:36.745 --> 34:39.708
THE EXACT AMOUNT THAT
WAS SENT TO REGINA.

34:39.708 --> 34:41.610
WELL WELL, LOOK AT THAT.

34:41.610 --> 34:43.352
CHIEF, YOU THINK
KAREN MIGHT HAVE--

34:43.352 --> 34:44.353
I DON'T THINK SO.

34:44.353 --> 34:45.854
I MEAN IF SHE HAD BEEN
CONNECTED TO THIS,

34:45.854 --> 34:48.357
WHY NOT JUST TELL US
WHEN SHE FIRST CONFESSED?

34:48.357 --> 34:49.688
WELL, SOMEONE HAD TO KNOW
ABOUT THAT ACCOUNT.

34:49.688 --> 34:52.161
SOMEONE ELSE MUST HAVE
HAD ACCESS TO IT.

34:52.161 --> 34:53.722
UNLESS VIKRAM SENT
THE MONEY HIMSELF.

34:55.164 --> 34:56.295
WE NEVER FOUND THE BODY.

35:00.399 --> 35:01.630
WE NEED TIME TO
GO THROUGH ALL THIS.

35:01.630 --> 35:03.101
WELL, WE'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE ANYMORE TIME.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.733
IF WE CHARGE KAREN
TOMORROW MORNING,

35:04.733 --> 35:06.205
THE CASE WILL BE OVER.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.507
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I TELL HER.

35:08.507 --> 35:09.508
SHE WON'T TRUST ME.

35:09.508 --> 35:10.779
NOTHING I SAY WILL
MAKE HER BACK DOWN.

35:10.779 --> 35:11.840
Danny: LET ME TRY AGAIN.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.182
PLEASE.

35:14.543 --> 35:17.186
Danny: YOU NEED TO RETRACT
YOUR CONFESSION NOW.

35:17.186 --> 35:20.719
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
YOU DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

35:26.195 --> 35:27.726
I, UH...

35:29.828 --> 35:31.530
I TALKED TO PRINCIPAL TANG.

35:33.162 --> 35:35.404
I KNOW, MOTHER.

35:35.404 --> 35:37.636
I KNOW EVERYTHING
YOU DID TO HELP ME.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.269
HOW YOU GOT ME
INTO THAT SCHOOL,

35:40.269 --> 35:41.610
HOW YOU KEPT ME FROM
GETTING EXPELLED.

35:43.812 --> 35:46.175
DANNY, IT--

35:46.175 --> 35:47.376
THAT'S DISTURBING?

35:47.376 --> 35:49.618
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.

35:53.782 --> 35:55.654
CHIEF MASTERSON'S CASE,

35:55.654 --> 35:58.757
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT ME
ANYMORE.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.659
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.831
YOU CAN'T KNOW
THAT FOR SURE.

36:02.831 --> 36:05.294
IS THAT A GOOD ENOUGH REASON
FOR YOU TO GO TO JAIL?

36:07.165 --> 36:08.667
I'M YOUR MOTHER.

36:11.600 --> 36:15.904
I HAVE TO BE
A GOOD MOTHER THIS TIME.

36:15.904 --> 36:19.408
( voice breaking )
YOU HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN A GOOD MOTHER.

36:19.408 --> 36:21.880
AND I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE ME.

36:25.384 --> 36:28.287
AND I NEED THAT
WITH ME.

36:28.287 --> 36:31.390
SO PLEASE. DON'T GO.

36:31.390 --> 36:32.391
I NEED MY MOM.

36:34.223 --> 36:35.264
OKAY?

36:35.264 --> 36:36.925
DON'T LEAVE ME.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.419
HEY, HOW IS SHE?

37:00.419 --> 37:01.920
SHE'S FINE.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.592
PRETTY EXHAUSTED.

37:03.592 --> 37:05.994
WELL, CONFESSING TO A MURDER
AND THEN RETRACTING

37:05.994 --> 37:08.457
ALL IN A TWO-DAY PERIOD,
IS A BIT OF A BUSY WEEKEND.

37:08.457 --> 37:10.529
YEAH.
TESS PICKED HER UP.

37:10.529 --> 37:11.560
SHE'S TAKING HER HOME.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.463
SO WHAT'S NEXT?

37:14.463 --> 37:16.535
I SOLVE THIS CASE?

37:16.535 --> 37:19.007
YEAH, BUT AM I
STILL A SUSPECT?

37:19.007 --> 37:21.570
BECAUSE I KIND OF PROMISED
MY MOTHER I WOULDN'T BE.

37:21.570 --> 37:23.872
ONE OF THE CONDITIONS
OF HER RETRACTING.

37:23.872 --> 37:25.614
I'M GONNA FIGURE OUT
WHO KILLED REGINA

37:25.614 --> 37:27.376
NO MATTER WHO IT IS.

37:27.376 --> 37:29.418
BUT YOU BETTER START
BEING HONEST WITH ME.

37:29.418 --> 37:31.680
WITHHOLDING EVIDENCE
IS A CRIME.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.382
I COULD CALL YOUR
PROBATION OFFICER

37:33.382 --> 37:35.324
AND SEND YOU BACK
TO JUVIE RIGHT NOW.

37:38.927 --> 37:41.259
WHEN MY MOTHER
FIRST TOLD ME THAT

37:41.259 --> 37:43.462
I'D BE MOVING BACK TO
GREEN GROVE AFTER JUVIE,

37:43.462 --> 37:47.396
I WASN'T EXACTLY
THRILLED WITH THAT IDEA.

37:47.396 --> 37:48.967
YOU KNOW?
BUT, UM...

37:51.570 --> 37:54.743
BUT NOW THE THOUGHT
OF NOT LIVING HERE,

37:54.743 --> 37:56.505
IT'S UNBEARABLE.

37:56.505 --> 37:57.576
THAT'S BECAUSE
OF YOUR DAUGHTER, SIR.

37:58.807 --> 38:00.449
AND LACEY.

38:00.449 --> 38:02.811
IT'S A NICE SPEECH, DANNY.

38:02.811 --> 38:04.513
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN NICER

38:04.513 --> 38:06.415
IF YOU HAD ACTUALLY
TOLD THEM THE TRUTH.

38:06.415 --> 38:09.658
IF I HAD TOLD THEM
THAT I HAD THE NECKLACE,

38:09.658 --> 38:11.990
I'D--

38:11.990 --> 38:13.892
I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE THEM.

38:13.892 --> 38:17.295
JO STUCK BY YOU
THROUGH A LOT.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.528
SO HAS LACEY.

38:19.528 --> 38:21.770
GIVE THEM BOTH A CHANCE.

38:21.770 --> 38:23.702
BE HONEST WITH THEM.

38:23.702 --> 38:25.634
YOU OWE THEM THAT.

38:32.441 --> 38:33.982
( sighs )

38:33.982 --> 38:38.517
CAN YOU IMAGINE FINDING OUT
YOUR 14-YEAR MARRIAGE WAS A LIE?

38:40.689 --> 38:42.621
YOU REALLY THINK
SHE HAD NO IDEA?

38:45.053 --> 38:47.526
BASED ON THE YELLING
HAPPENING UPSTAIRS RIGHT NOW,

38:47.526 --> 38:48.797
I'M GONNA GO WITH NO.

38:51.430 --> 38:54.002
GUESS IF YOU'RE WITH SOMEONE
YOU CARE ABOUT,

38:54.002 --> 38:56.435
YOU JUST--

38:56.435 --> 38:58.467
YOU SEE THE PERSON
YOU WANT TO SEE.

39:01.510 --> 39:02.971
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

39:05.374 --> 39:07.045
YOU WISH I'D
KEPT MY MOUTH SHUT?

39:08.817 --> 39:11.049
NO.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.522
I MEAN, IT'S WEIRD.

39:13.522 --> 39:18.587
IT'S LIKE I DON'T
KNOW HIM NOW OR SOMETHING.

39:18.587 --> 39:20.589
BUT I JUST REALLY
WANT HIM TO BE HAPPY.

39:23.662 --> 39:24.993
WHO KNOWS?

39:24.993 --> 39:27.436
NOW THAT HE'S NOT HIDING
A GAY DOUBLE-LIFE IN SEATTLE,

39:27.436 --> 39:30.939
MAYBE HE'LL VISIT US
MORE THAN TWICE A YEAR.

39:30.939 --> 39:33.402
THANKS...

39:33.402 --> 39:35.474
FOR TELLING ME.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.546
NO PROBLEM.

39:37.546 --> 39:40.008
FRIENDS DON'T
KEEP SECRETS, RIGHT?

39:44.483 --> 39:46.485
( cellphones vibrate )

39:48.717 --> 39:50.559
IT'S FROM DANNY.

39:50.559 --> 39:51.720
SAME.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.592
WHY WOULD HE NEED
TO MEET US RIGHT AWAY?

39:53.592 --> 39:55.163
SOMETHING ABOUT HIS MOM?

39:58.066 --> 40:00.569
( typing )

40:28.597 --> 40:30.799
- ( door opens )
- Karen: OH, MY GOD.

40:30.799 --> 40:33.131
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE
SO HAPPY TO SEE THIS HOUSE.

40:33.131 --> 40:35.203
I'M SURE.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.737
WANT ME TO MAKE YOU
SOME TEA OR SOMETHING?

40:38.737 --> 40:41.540
TEA?
HOW ABOUT A VODKA?

40:41.540 --> 40:43.672
( laughs )
FAIR ENOUGH.

40:49.217 --> 40:50.979
( door opens )

40:52.581 --> 40:54.653
UH-OH.

40:54.653 --> 40:55.954
VODKA NIGHT, IS IT?

40:55.954 --> 40:58.226
OH YEAH.

40:58.226 --> 40:59.958
KAREN, WHAT'S WRONG?

41:01.590 --> 41:03.592
I'M SENSING SOMETHING
DANNY-RELATED.

41:03.592 --> 41:04.633
AM I WARM?

41:04.633 --> 41:06.495
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

41:09.998 --> 41:11.540
HONEY, HE'S TEN.

41:11.540 --> 41:12.701
HE'S GOING THROUGH
A PHASE, THAT'S ALL.

41:12.701 --> 41:14.643
THIS ISN'T A PHASE.
IT'S JUST US.

41:14.643 --> 41:15.704
IT'S ME AND DANNY.

41:15.704 --> 41:17.045
YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO HIM?

41:17.045 --> 41:18.577
IT WON'T MATTER.

41:26.054 --> 41:27.516
( clears throat )
OH, BY THE WAY,

41:27.516 --> 41:29.858
I'VE GOT TO BE IN CONNECTICUT
THE NEXT COUPLE OF NIGHTS.

41:29.858 --> 41:31.520
REMEMBER, IF ANYONE ASKS,
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE--

41:31.520 --> 41:32.561
I KNOW THE DRILL, VIK.

41:32.561 --> 41:35.163
IF ANYONE ASKS, YOU'RE
IN MANHATTAN ON BUSINESS.

41:35.163 --> 41:37.195
THAT'S MY LOVING WIFE.

41:51.540 --> 41:53.712
Jo: DANNY.

41:54.943 --> 41:56.014
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

41:56.014 --> 41:58.687
YEAH, YEAH.
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

41:58.687 --> 41:59.848
HOW'S EVERYTHING
WITH YOUR MOM?

41:59.848 --> 42:01.750
SHE RETRACTED
HER CONFESSION.

42:01.750 --> 42:05.594
WOW, SO THEY'RE
JUST GONNA LET HER GO?

42:05.594 --> 42:07.255
YEAH, THERE WASN'T
ENOUGH ACTUAL EVIDENCE

42:07.255 --> 42:09.257
TO HOLD HER NOW.

42:09.257 --> 42:10.629
WHICH MEANS--

42:10.629 --> 42:12.601
IT MEANS YOU DON'T
HAVE TO MOVE TO ARIZONA.

42:12.601 --> 42:14.903
- Lacey: DANNY, THAT'S--
- Danny: IT'S GREAT.

42:14.903 --> 42:16.234
IT IS.
IT IS GREAT.

42:16.234 --> 42:17.265
UM, BUT--

42:17.265 --> 42:18.567
THE NECKLACE.

42:20.709 --> 42:21.970
IF SHE DIDN'T KILL REGINA,

42:21.970 --> 42:23.942
THEN HOW DID SHE GET IT?

42:23.942 --> 42:26.314
FROM ME.

42:28.617 --> 42:29.748
SHE GOT THE NECKLACE
FROM ME.

42:29.748 --> 42:30.949
WHA--

42:30.949 --> 42:32.721
I KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS
ARE THINKING, OKAY.

42:32.721 --> 42:33.982
BUT I DID NOT
TAKE THAT NECKLACE

42:33.982 --> 42:35.253
FROM REGINA, I SWEAR.

42:35.253 --> 42:37.125
THE DAY AFTER SHE DIED,
I JUST FOUND IT.

42:37.125 --> 42:38.156
IT WAS IN MY LOCKER--

42:38.156 --> 42:40.058
YOUR LOCKER?!
SERIOUSLY?!

42:40.058 --> 42:41.630
LACEY, I'M TELLING
YOU THE TRUTH.

42:41.630 --> 42:43.091
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE THAT?!

42:43.091 --> 42:46.294
YOU'VE LIED TO US OVER
AND OVER AGAIN, DANNY!

42:46.294 --> 42:47.836
GOD!

42:47.836 --> 42:49.838
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT!
I CAN'T BELIEVE I LET YOU--

42:55.003 --> 42:56.174
WE'RE DONE.

42:57.646 --> 42:59.608
LACEY.
LACEY!

43:01.149 --> 43:02.911
JO,
JUST LISTEN TO ME.

43:02.911 --> 43:05.283
OKAY, JUST-- CAN YOU JUST
LISTEN TO ME, PLEASE?

43:05.283 --> 43:07.315
CAN YOU LISTEN TO ME?!

43:11.589 --> 43:13.892
( chattering )

43:17.626 --> 43:19.327
( computer beeps )
