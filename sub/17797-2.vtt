00:07.231 --> 00:09.033
<i>Previously on The Affair...</i>

00:09.035 --> 00:11.438
Hey. Do I know you?

00:11.440 --> 00:12.540
I operated on your son.

00:12.542 --> 00:14.745
God. Dr. Ullah.

00:14.747 --> 00:16.247
<i>You're not going to,
like, ask me out on a date</i>

00:16.248 --> 00:17.550
<i>or anything, are you?</i>

00:17.552 --> 00:19.288
<i>I was thinking about it.</i>

00:21.961 --> 00:24.698
<i>Luisa, I promise
I will be faithful to you</i>

00:24.700 --> 00:26.935
<i>with my body and with my heart.</i>

00:26.937 --> 00:28.773
<i>She can't have kids.</i>

00:28.775 --> 00:29.808
I think I always thought I was going to get

00:29.810 --> 00:31.244
to be a father again.

00:31.246 --> 00:33.081
<i>I had a son. He drowned.</i>

00:33.083 --> 00:34.785
<i>- How old was he?
- Four.</i>

00:34.787 --> 00:36.789
God.

00:36.791 --> 00:38.659
This wasn't your fault.

00:38.661 --> 00:40.997
There's no way you could have known.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.469
<i>But if I had
taken him to the hospital,</i>

00:43.471 --> 00:46.107
<i>would he be alive now?</i>

00:46.109 --> 00:48.579
<i>Is that your first?</i>

00:48.581 --> 00:50.283
No.

00:50.285 --> 00:51.117
Is this your daughter?

00:51.119 --> 00:52.253
This is Joanie.

00:52.255 --> 00:53.522
<i>Did you tell Cole yet?</i>

00:53.524 --> 00:56.094
Someone is going to tell him, Ali,

00:56.096 --> 00:58.432
and it's either you or me.

00:58.434 --> 01:01.705
Joanie's not your daughter.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.149
Fuck.

01:07.151 --> 01:08.452
Fuck you!

01:08.454 --> 01:10.155
Jesus, fuck!

01:11.059 --> 01:12.427
Don't! Noah!

01:12.429 --> 01:14.464
<i>Just forget this ever happened.</i>

01:14.466 --> 01:16.134
I don't want you involved.

01:16.136 --> 01:17.604
I love you.

01:17.606 --> 01:19.307
I'm guilty. I killed Scott Lockhart.

01:19.309 --> 01:21.912
- What the hell are you doing?
- We need to talk.

01:21.914 --> 01:25.118
- About what?
- About us.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.755
What about us?

01:26.757 --> 01:28.191
Excuse me.

03:03.818 --> 03:06.722
- I'm gonna come.
- No, not yet.

03:06.724 --> 03:10.396
Not allowed..

03:10.398 --> 03:11.898
Shit.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.604
- But... Helen.
- No, no.

03:14.606 --> 03:16.944
Don't.

03:21.185 --> 03:24.524
Jesus.

03:41.894 --> 03:44.898
You know it's 6:56.

03:44.900 --> 03:46.303
What?

03:47.572 --> 03:50.976
Fuck. Fuck.

03:50.978 --> 03:53.782
Okay, fuck.

03:53.784 --> 03:57.189
I will, thank you.

04:19.235 --> 04:20.336
I got to go.

04:24.145 --> 04:25.980
Why'd you let us hump so long?

04:29.956 --> 04:33.595
"Hump." That's really the worst.

04:33.597 --> 04:36.603
I like it. I want to revive it.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.613
That's new.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.553
Yeah, that's Rex, my new roommate.

04:45.555 --> 04:47.189
He's great.

04:47.191 --> 04:48.994
A little prickly, but...

04:53.236 --> 04:55.406
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:55.408 --> 04:56.875
You want me to get you an Uber?

04:56.877 --> 04:58.881
No. I can walk.

05:07.966 --> 05:10.001
Six minutes, I'm out of here.

05:10.003 --> 05:13.009
- You'd better be ready.
- I'm eating.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.316
Tech rehearsal starts Wednesday

05:17.318 --> 05:19.287
and the whole cabana set's collapsing.

05:19.289 --> 05:21.691
I'm meeting Atticus early
and Stacey won't move her ass.

05:21.693 --> 05:22.793
Good morning.

05:22.795 --> 05:24.364
Are you still buttering?

05:24.366 --> 05:26.868
How's that possible?
It's not humanly possible.

05:26.870 --> 05:28.672
Trevor, why don't you just go
and get your stuff together?

05:28.674 --> 05:30.174
Look at her.

05:30.176 --> 05:31.010
She's purposely trying to make me late.

05:31.012 --> 05:32.014
Go.

05:36.490 --> 05:38.190
You know I can walk myself.

05:38.192 --> 05:40.496
Well, we've discussed
this, and no, you can't.

05:40.498 --> 05:41.564
I can actually.

05:41.566 --> 05:43.435
Mia walks herself.

05:43.437 --> 05:44.737
And Eve.

05:44.739 --> 05:46.508
Well, Eve lives across the street.

05:46.510 --> 05:48.177
And Beatrice. Beatrice goes alone

05:48.179 --> 05:50.048
and she's, like, 15 blocks away.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.620
<i>Well, Beatrice also has a mom
that let her watch Shameless</i>

05:52.622 --> 05:54.757
in second grade and a dickhead banker dad

05:54.759 --> 05:55.926
that voted for Trump.

05:55.928 --> 05:57.296
Which dad is worse?

05:57.298 --> 05:59.968
Dickhead banker... or convicted felon?

05:59.970 --> 06:02.005
- Mom!
- Just go brush your teeth,

06:02.007 --> 06:03.009
okay, Stace?

06:04.913 --> 06:06.514
Your chem test is tomorrow, right?

06:06.516 --> 06:07.683
Been studying?

06:07.685 --> 06:10.422
No, I thought I'd just wing it.

06:10.424 --> 06:12.158
- Yeah, I'm studying.
- 20... 19...

06:12.160 --> 06:14.897
Yes, well, you know,
Vik majored in chemistry.

06:14.899 --> 06:16.501
- I'm sure he could help.
- 17...

06:16.503 --> 06:17.703
Yeah, you said that.

06:17.705 --> 06:20.074
16... 15...

06:20.076 --> 06:21.911
- 14.
- Okay then.

06:21.913 --> 06:23.348
Mozzarella?

06:23.350 --> 06:24.884
Yes. And salami.

06:24.886 --> 06:25.919
What's the problem?

06:25.921 --> 06:27.723
Good morning, Sollamanders.

06:27.725 --> 06:30.128
I'll buy a bagel.

06:30.130 --> 06:32.867
Five, four, three.

06:32.869 --> 06:35.238
- I'm coming! Wait!
- For fuck's sake.

06:38.580 --> 06:40.616
Hello?

06:40.618 --> 06:42.286
Hey, you. How's it going?

06:42.288 --> 06:44.089
- Later, Stacey.
- Wait!

06:44.091 --> 06:46.095
Yeah, right.

06:48.634 --> 06:50.269
- Here you go, sweetheart.
- Thanks, Mom.

06:50.271 --> 06:52.138
Hey, listen. Promise me something.

06:52.140 --> 06:55.279
- What?
- Don't go full teenage on me.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.850
Tween I can handle.

06:57.852 --> 06:58.785
Okay, go catch up to him. Go ahead.

06:58.787 --> 07:00.522
Thanks.

07:00.524 --> 07:04.029
Hey, Stace, did you finish
that card you were working on?

07:04.031 --> 07:05.566
Are you going today?

07:05.568 --> 07:07.436
Gonna try to.

07:07.438 --> 07:08.805
It's on my desk.

07:08.807 --> 07:10.411
- Okay, bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

07:12.615 --> 07:16.421
Wait! Wait! Dickhead!

07:18.727 --> 07:19.894
No, no, no.

07:19.896 --> 07:21.431
It's okay, it's fine.

07:21.433 --> 07:25.305
Okay, let's check in later
then. That might work.

07:25.307 --> 07:28.345
Now I'm scared.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.816
No, no, me too.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.319
See you soon.

07:33.790 --> 07:35.459
- Who's that?
- No one.

07:35.461 --> 07:37.263
Work thing.

07:40.804 --> 07:42.606
All good?

07:44.546 --> 07:46.514
You have many,

07:46.516 --> 07:48.050
many offspring.

07:50.056 --> 07:51.691
Why is that?

07:54.866 --> 07:57.035
I should get going, too.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.317
What about that?

08:05.854 --> 08:07.121
Trevor's sandwich?

08:07.123 --> 08:08.325
I got back-to-back surgeries.

08:08.327 --> 08:10.996
It might makes sense to bring lunch.

08:10.998 --> 08:12.766
There you go, dear.

08:12.768 --> 08:14.937
You're the best.

08:14.939 --> 08:17.376
And we're having dinner with
Whitney tonight, don't forget.

08:17.378 --> 08:19.680
There's another one?

08:21.118 --> 08:24.022
How many is that, 11?

08:51.846 --> 08:53.748
Do you want me to be honest?

08:53.750 --> 08:56.287
Yes, please.

08:56.289 --> 08:57.589
You're never going to sell this place

08:57.591 --> 08:59.059
unless we go ahead and stage it.

08:59.061 --> 09:00.862
Not at the number you're looking for.

09:00.864 --> 09:02.499
Astrid, stop. Don't... don't do that.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.370
- People, they want orderly.
- Please, Mommy.

09:04.372 --> 09:06.674
They want sleek. Everything
in their life isn't.

09:06.676 --> 09:08.210
You don't think the paint job helped?

09:08.212 --> 09:10.181
I think if you shove all
this stuff in storage,

09:10.183 --> 09:12.586
we can transform this place
completely in two days.

09:12.588 --> 09:14.757
Make that 24 hours.

09:14.759 --> 09:17.863
I mean, look at the stats. You can see.

09:17.865 --> 09:21.169
Long Island City, Greenpoint, Williamsburg.

09:21.171 --> 09:24.443
Staged apartments sold on
average 12% above asking.

09:24.445 --> 09:25.846
And when Trish is the one that's doing it,

09:25.848 --> 09:27.583
that jumps to almost 20%.

09:27.585 --> 09:30.591
I'm gonna go take some
measurements in the restroom.

09:35.768 --> 09:38.304
Let me tell you something.

09:38.306 --> 09:40.442
Trish's husband left in August.

09:40.444 --> 09:42.579
He had an affair with the dog walker.

09:42.581 --> 09:44.617
She has chronic insomnia.

09:44.619 --> 09:46.954
She's also the sole
caretaker of her mother,

09:46.956 --> 09:49.760
who has Alzheimer's, and her son, Jedediah,

09:49.762 --> 09:52.131
who's six.

09:52.133 --> 09:53.804
And autistic.

09:55.674 --> 09:57.074
And so...?

09:57.076 --> 10:00.247
So the woman is a master of illusion.

10:00.249 --> 10:02.619
I mean, she's hanging by a thread,

10:02.621 --> 10:04.356
but you don't see that
when you look at her.

10:04.358 --> 10:06.994
When you look at her, you see calm.

10:06.996 --> 10:08.631
You see sophistication. You see...

10:08.633 --> 10:09.934
- Sleek?
- Yes.

10:09.936 --> 10:12.339
And this place is aching for that.

10:12.341 --> 10:14.844
I love the penny tiles.

10:14.846 --> 10:17.852
So what are we thinking?
Are we gonna do this?

10:23.396 --> 10:25.632
They'll be back in an hour.

10:25.634 --> 10:27.001
Poor Ma.

10:27.003 --> 10:29.005
Might have to put her in a home soon.

10:30.878 --> 10:32.546
Nice touch with the son.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.416
Jedediah.

10:34.418 --> 10:36.152
Like I'd ever name a kid that.

10:36.154 --> 10:37.856
Stop. I feel bad now.

10:37.858 --> 10:39.326
Don't you ever feel bad?

10:39.328 --> 10:40.328
No.

10:40.330 --> 10:42.399
Not when it gets me the job.

10:42.401 --> 10:44.102
Look at this view.

10:44.104 --> 10:46.374
I want this view.

10:47.912 --> 10:50.515
I tell you about that job
I did for Jocelyn last week?

10:50.517 --> 10:52.686
Windsor Terrace ground floor apartment.

10:52.688 --> 10:55.458
They did an open house on Sunday.

10:57.464 --> 10:59.869
Wow. Crap.

11:01.104 --> 11:02.873
I need to triple Vik's rent.

11:02.875 --> 11:05.077
Well, you could do that. Or you could...

11:05.079 --> 11:06.547
get him to move in with you

11:06.549 --> 11:08.651
and find someone else to pay full freight.

11:08.653 --> 11:11.158
That is not happening.

11:13.028 --> 11:14.897
What?

11:14.899 --> 11:18.236
What? I'm just wondering where
this relationship is going.

11:18.238 --> 11:20.074
Well, it's not going
anywhere if I can help it.

11:20.076 --> 11:22.178
I think it's kind of
perfect right where it is.

11:22.180 --> 11:24.383
He has his space, I have my space.

11:24.385 --> 11:26.052
Great sex one flight away.

11:26.054 --> 11:28.958
No headache, no strings.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.062
I don't know why I ever got
married in the first place.

11:31.064 --> 11:33.701
I should have been doing
this from the very beginning.

11:33.703 --> 11:35.405
- So you're happy?
- Yes, I am.

11:35.407 --> 11:36.909
I've never been happier.

12:17.324 --> 12:19.426
- You're alone again?
- Hi.

12:19.428 --> 12:22.666
Jesus Christ, what is that?

12:22.668 --> 12:24.770
- What, this?
- Yes. My God.

12:24.772 --> 12:26.139
Can you even see?

12:26.141 --> 12:27.141
I can see.

12:27.143 --> 12:29.279
I slipped in the lunch line.

12:29.281 --> 12:30.749
- Bullshit.
- No, I did.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.151
- Some idiot spilled the juice.
- That's it.

12:32.153 --> 12:33.488
I'm getting you moved.

12:33.490 --> 12:34.790
You tried that. It didn't work.

12:34.792 --> 12:35.992
Well, it's going to now.

12:35.994 --> 12:38.297
I mean, this is just outrageous.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.468
Your wrist three weeks ago
and then before that your hand...

12:40.470 --> 12:41.670
- Keep your voice down.
- Why?

12:41.672 --> 12:43.508
So fatty over there won't hear me?

12:43.510 --> 12:45.712
He's letting this happen to
you if he's not doing it to you.

12:45.714 --> 12:47.718
I mean it. Shut your mouth.

12:54.498 --> 12:57.302
I don't want your help,
Helen. I told you that.

12:57.304 --> 13:00.508
I've got nine months left
here. I can make it nine months.

13:00.510 --> 13:02.579
Yes, but I read an article in some journal.

13:02.581 --> 13:04.616
People can actually sue prisons.

13:04.618 --> 13:05.985
I can't, but you can.

13:05.987 --> 13:07.656
And there's this guy in Delaware, I think.

13:07.658 --> 13:09.426
I don't know what he's in
for. Drugs maybe, but...

13:09.428 --> 13:11.029
You found the earrings.

13:11.031 --> 13:13.701
- What?
- Didn't we buy those in Mexico?

13:13.703 --> 13:15.473
I thought you lost them.

13:16.976 --> 13:18.511
Yeah, well, I...

13:18.513 --> 13:21.216
I found them.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.988
Lo and behold.

13:27.364 --> 13:28.965
Look, I'm sorry, Noah.

13:28.967 --> 13:30.200
It's just I can't stand
to see you like this.

13:30.202 --> 13:31.973
Where are the kids?

13:34.043 --> 13:36.145
It's Tuesday. They're in school.

13:36.147 --> 13:37.549
Last time was Saturday.

13:37.551 --> 13:38.751
You didn't bring them then either.

13:38.753 --> 13:40.989
Well, I don't... was it a Saturday?

13:40.991 --> 13:42.859
I don't... I don't know.

13:42.861 --> 13:44.997
It's just that the kids,
they have these lives

13:44.999 --> 13:46.333
all of a sudden.

13:46.335 --> 13:48.236
Trevor's in a play. Did I tell you that?

13:48.238 --> 13:51.410
<i>They're doing The
Tempest set in Cuba,</i>

13:51.412 --> 13:53.881
so it's half in Spanish with samba music.

13:53.883 --> 13:55.083
Can you imagine sitting through that?

13:55.085 --> 13:57.089
You're lucky you're in here.

13:59.695 --> 14:01.363
I'm sorry.

14:01.365 --> 14:02.632
I don't know why I said that.

14:02.634 --> 14:05.838
I'm very nervous. I don't...

14:05.840 --> 14:07.575
I don't know why. I'm...

14:07.577 --> 14:08.813
um...

14:10.049 --> 14:12.153
I'm going to see Whitney tonight.

14:14.892 --> 14:16.493
Meet the boyfriend.

14:16.495 --> 14:17.996
She really hasn't said anything about him

14:17.998 --> 14:20.868
except for, um, he's some sort of artist.

14:20.870 --> 14:23.574
And he has a loft in, Greenpoint,

14:23.576 --> 14:25.411
which I don't know how he affords that,

14:25.413 --> 14:28.419
- except maybe his parents...
- I need to see my kids, Helen.

14:30.122 --> 14:32.792
Look around you. Look...
look at all these kids.

14:32.794 --> 14:35.698
Over there and over there.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.402
A lot of them come twice a week.

14:37.404 --> 14:39.439
- I know that, Noah.
- They drive for hours.

14:39.441 --> 14:41.276
- The mothers get them here.
- I know.

14:41.278 --> 14:43.914
- It's not that difficult.
- They hate coming here.

14:43.916 --> 14:47.622
They saw the bruises and your wrist.

14:47.624 --> 14:49.292
- It's upsetting.
- They told you this?

14:49.294 --> 14:50.661
They... they're refusing to come?

14:50.663 --> 14:52.332
What do you think I've been talking about?

14:52.334 --> 14:54.770
We have to fucking do
something. You can't stay here.

14:54.772 --> 14:56.306
Jesus Christ.

14:56.308 --> 14:58.677
I mean, you want them to
see you like this right now?

14:58.679 --> 15:01.316
You're beaten and angry.
I-I don't know how to fix it.

15:01.318 --> 15:03.589
I don't want you coming back here.

15:05.860 --> 15:07.796
- What?
- I don't want to be moved.

15:07.798 --> 15:10.435
I don't need you to "fix" things.

15:17.918 --> 15:19.286
You don't want me to come and see you?

15:19.288 --> 15:21.222
I don't understand.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.892
I never understood why you were
coming here in the first place.

15:22.894 --> 15:24.161
I never asked you to come.

15:24.163 --> 15:25.598
I only let you come for the kids,

15:25.600 --> 15:27.635
and the kids aren't coming.

15:31.745 --> 15:35.351
That's what I want, Helen.
I want you to leave me alone.

15:38.359 --> 15:39.826
Is that too much to ask?

15:39.828 --> 15:41.348
I mean, haven't I fucking done enough?

15:43.302 --> 15:46.306
No, I'm very aware of
what you've done for me.

15:51.318 --> 15:54.155
I thought you did it for...

16:01.405 --> 16:03.941
for the kids, I guess.

16:03.943 --> 16:05.945
And for...

16:10.757 --> 16:13.761
I don't know why I think you did it.

16:16.368 --> 16:17.835
I'm out of time.

16:19.541 --> 16:20.841
You get back safe.

16:20.843 --> 16:23.847
Wait, I have, um, wait. Stacey made this.

16:23.849 --> 16:26.553
Can I give this to him?

18:58.459 --> 19:00.828
You okay?

19:00.830 --> 19:02.999
- You made it. Hi.
- Hi.

19:03.001 --> 19:05.571
You smell so good. We're super excited.

19:05.573 --> 19:07.007
- Vikram.
- Hello.

19:08.312 --> 19:10.781
- Wine.
- Thank you, sir.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.620
Please tell me you didn't
get stuck in the elevator.

19:13.622 --> 19:17.093
What is this place? An airplane hangar?

19:20.603 --> 19:22.939
Um...

19:22.941 --> 19:25.109
This place is amazing.

19:26.615 --> 19:28.049
Furkat took all of them.

19:28.051 --> 19:29.986
Let me...

19:29.988 --> 19:32.157
Mom, Vik, this is Furkat.

19:32.159 --> 19:34.862
Furkat, this is my mother, Helen,

19:34.864 --> 19:37.067
and Vik, the stomach surgeon.

19:37.069 --> 19:39.806
Welcome. Glad you found us okay.

19:39.808 --> 19:41.008
Shake his hand, Mom.

19:41.010 --> 19:42.812
Hi.

19:42.814 --> 19:46.486
Say your name again.
Is that F-U-R- "cat"?

19:46.488 --> 19:49.157
- Like the animal?
- Like the pet, just with a "K."

19:50.696 --> 19:53.934
Is that Turkish or Russian or...

19:53.936 --> 19:56.238
I'm sorry, Whitney didn't
really tell us much.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.042
No, none of the above.

19:58.044 --> 19:59.244
He made it up.

19:59.246 --> 20:01.683
Twenty-five years ago.

20:01.685 --> 20:05.089
Youthful pretension. Then it stuck.

20:05.091 --> 20:07.060
Whatever. I think it's hot.

20:07.062 --> 20:09.131
<i>Come, I made hors d'oeuvres.</i>

20:13.409 --> 20:15.778
May I have some of that?

20:15.780 --> 20:17.481
It's Patagonian toothfish

20:17.483 --> 20:19.552
with caramelized shallots and kumquats.

20:19.554 --> 20:23.994
Also known as Chilean sea bass
with little tiny bitter oranges.

20:23.996 --> 20:26.566
I didn't know you knew how to cook fish.

20:26.568 --> 20:28.303
Or to cook.

20:28.305 --> 20:30.441
Well, it's one of my many new skills.

20:30.443 --> 20:32.678
Part of... what did Sven
call it the other day?

20:32.680 --> 20:35.517
- My Furkat learning curve.
- Um, yeah, yeah, right.

20:37.122 --> 20:40.193
So, these are all for sale?

20:40.195 --> 20:42.298
The ladies over there, yeah.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.969
The ones on this wall go to Germany.

20:44.971 --> 20:46.840
We have a Berlin show in February.

20:46.842 --> 20:49.144
And then Munich in June.

20:49.146 --> 20:50.447
Which you're going to?

20:50.449 --> 20:51.983
<i>Ja, naturlich.</i>

20:51.985 --> 20:54.822
Martin's graduation is June 23rd.

20:54.824 --> 20:56.326
That's if he graduates.

20:56.328 --> 20:57.964
Hold on, I'll find you a price list.

20:59.834 --> 21:01.770
She was just saying I needed artwork.

21:01.772 --> 21:03.440
You're buying one?

21:03.442 --> 21:04.842
I might.

21:04.844 --> 21:06.846
It'll liven up the place.

21:06.848 --> 21:08.750
Here you go. Just a ballpark.

21:08.752 --> 21:10.854
You'd get a discount, of
course. Friends and family.

21:10.856 --> 21:13.460
Look how she put that
together. Organized, beautiful.

21:13.462 --> 21:15.297
Okay, I feel like I need to ask a question.

21:15.299 --> 21:16.301
Um...

21:17.503 --> 21:19.338
Are you two working together?

21:19.340 --> 21:21.175
I'm his assistant.

21:24.149 --> 21:25.984
Okay, so...

21:30.128 --> 21:31.529
Are any of these...

21:31.531 --> 21:33.300
Me? No.

21:36.374 --> 21:38.376
I mean, I might model eventually.

21:38.378 --> 21:39.846
- Sure.
- But right now,

21:39.848 --> 21:41.382
Furkat needs me on this side of the camera.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.918
I do his schedule, his books...

21:42.920 --> 21:45.022
And you still have
time to go to school?

21:46.361 --> 21:48.162
Don't tell me you stopped going, Whitney.

21:48.164 --> 21:50.834
- I just paid your tuition.
- You're concerned, Helen.

21:50.836 --> 21:52.003
I get that.

21:52.005 --> 21:55.009
But try to think

21:55.011 --> 21:57.348
of what Whitney's doing as
a sort of apprenticeship.

21:57.350 --> 22:00.186
She'll learn more in six months with me

22:00.188 --> 22:01.623
than she would in three years

22:01.625 --> 22:04.160
at the Fashion Institute of Total Bullshit.

22:04.162 --> 22:07.166
For example, I got my last girlfriend a job

22:07.168 --> 22:09.906
<i>at das Neue Galerie, so...</i>

22:11.711 --> 22:13.580
Can we talk alone?

22:13.582 --> 22:15.216
Fine.

22:15.218 --> 22:17.821
But maybe first you can
tell me how what you're doing

22:17.823 --> 22:18.723
is any different.

22:18.725 --> 22:19.926
How what I'm doing?

22:19.928 --> 22:21.194
You know, Vik living in your basement,

22:21.196 --> 22:23.232
paying you rent, while also fucking you.

22:23.234 --> 22:24.936
- Ahem.
- Ha! Is that true?

22:24.938 --> 22:26.606
Yes. It's totally insane.

22:26.608 --> 22:28.443
But whatever. I'm not the one judging.

22:28.445 --> 22:30.414
First of all, Vik is my
tenant. He doesn't work for me.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.284
Second of all, we are grown-ups

22:32.286 --> 22:35.022
that made a grown-up decision
to protect your three siblings.

22:35.024 --> 22:36.426
- Really? For my siblings?
- Yes.

22:36.428 --> 22:37.962
They have been through a lot.

22:37.964 --> 22:39.799
Honestly, you'd have to
bring your own waterboard

22:39.801 --> 22:41.101
to fuck them up more than my dad did.

22:41.103 --> 22:42.538
Stop. That's it.

22:42.540 --> 22:44.140
I can't sit here and listen to that.

22:44.142 --> 22:46.746
I thought... I was hoping
maybe you'd grown up.

22:46.748 --> 22:48.550
I know you think you have, but I...

22:48.552 --> 22:49.952
- Helen.
- I can't...

22:49.954 --> 22:51.923
how long have we been here? A half hour?

22:51.925 --> 22:53.626
That's how long it takes you
to start attacking your father?

22:53.628 --> 22:56.332
- I wasn't attacking him.
- Your level of hate is insane.

22:56.334 --> 22:57.501
He... he made some mistakes.

22:57.503 --> 22:59.438
Some mistakes? He's a murderer.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.676
Just because he was convicted
doesn't mean he's guilty.

23:01.678 --> 23:04.281
Mom, for God sakes, the
only person who doesn't think

23:04.283 --> 23:05.953
he did it is you.

23:07.957 --> 23:09.959
He treated you like shit.

23:09.961 --> 23:11.729
He cheated and he lied...

23:11.731 --> 23:13.568
Someone's hurting him.

23:15.305 --> 23:17.875
I saw him today. His eye's swollen shut.

23:17.877 --> 23:21.114
He has a gash on his cheek. He...

23:21.116 --> 23:25.056
I'm confused. You were
up at the prison today?

23:25.058 --> 23:26.392
Why are you still visiting him?

23:26.394 --> 23:27.795
Because he's your father.

23:27.797 --> 23:29.298
Because he'll always be your father.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.834
Because you can't just
erase him from your life.

23:30.836 --> 23:32.471
No, sure she can.

23:32.473 --> 23:34.174
I haven't spoken to my
father since I was 14,

23:34.176 --> 23:35.410
and look how well I turned out.

23:35.412 --> 23:36.579
Shut up.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.148
I know you think you know everything,

23:38.150 --> 23:39.985
but you don't. You don't.

23:39.987 --> 23:41.355
There are things that
happened that night...

23:41.357 --> 23:42.793
That night?

23:44.597 --> 23:47.603
What happened that night
that I don't know about?

23:52.546 --> 23:54.782
He was drinking.

23:54.784 --> 23:56.819
<i>Quelle surprise.</i>

23:56.821 --> 23:58.490
He offered to drive me home.

23:58.492 --> 24:00.694
He did?

24:00.696 --> 24:03.132
I thought you took a cab.

24:03.134 --> 24:04.804
I said no.

24:07.810 --> 24:10.081
But then I let him drive away.

24:13.154 --> 24:14.688
So?

24:14.690 --> 24:17.794
So, I should have stopped him.

24:17.796 --> 24:20.467
Don't do that. Do not roll your eyes.

24:20.469 --> 24:23.205
Somebody died because I let him drive away.

24:23.207 --> 24:24.675
How would you have stopped him?

24:24.677 --> 24:26.044
I don't know, I don't know,

24:26.046 --> 24:27.447
but I know I could have prevented it.

24:27.449 --> 24:30.054
If you want to hate
someone, Whitney, hate me.

24:33.461 --> 24:38.371
Mom, what happened to Scotty
was in no way your fault.

24:44.584 --> 24:47.220
I ca... I have a really bad headache.

24:47.222 --> 24:48.723
I have to go.

24:48.725 --> 24:49.892
Wait, what?

24:49.894 --> 24:51.996
Helen, I think you should stay.

24:51.998 --> 24:55.202
I can't. I ha... um,
nice to meet you, Furkat.

24:55.204 --> 24:56.941
Um...

24:58.945 --> 25:00.882
how much for that one?

25:23.361 --> 25:26.367
Helen, can you hold this for a sec?

25:32.178 --> 25:33.446
- Thank you.
- Okay, then.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.583
You two have a good night.

25:35.585 --> 25:37.554
What are you mad about, Helen?

25:37.556 --> 25:39.123
That I bought the dumb photograph?

25:39.125 --> 25:41.595
- How was your sandwich?
- What?

25:41.597 --> 25:43.231
Trevor's sandwich. You
took it to work today.

25:43.233 --> 25:44.968
- I don't... what...
- And then you texted me,

25:44.970 --> 25:48.041
"Loved our lunch, be in touch
soon," with a smiley face.

25:48.043 --> 25:50.212
- I sent that to you?
- Was that not meant for me?

25:50.214 --> 25:51.384
Oops.

25:53.421 --> 25:56.427
I mean, please just tell me who she is.

25:59.333 --> 26:01.602
Who did you have lunch with, Vik?

26:01.604 --> 26:04.375
She's the daughter of a friend of mine.

26:04.377 --> 26:05.677
She's a med student.

26:05.679 --> 26:08.215
I fucking knew it.

26:08.217 --> 26:09.918
She's applying for a residency,

26:09.920 --> 26:11.589
and he asked if I would meet with her.

26:11.591 --> 26:13.359
We were supposed to have coffee.

26:13.361 --> 26:15.563
My schedule shifted, we had lunch instead.

26:15.565 --> 26:16.732
And...?

26:16.734 --> 26:18.936
And we're running off together.

26:18.938 --> 26:21.742
We had a quick bite at Panera
and now we're eloping to Tahiti.

26:21.744 --> 26:24.080
- Did I not mention that?
- I'm going up.

26:24.082 --> 26:25.417
I don't want to fuck her, Helen,

26:25.419 --> 26:27.254
if that's what you're worried about.

26:27.256 --> 26:28.491
Hold it.

26:29.593 --> 26:31.127
Hold on.

26:31.129 --> 26:33.833
We need to talk about this, Helen.

26:33.835 --> 26:36.272
I don't mention one lunch
and that's a problem?

26:36.274 --> 26:37.941
Some big betrayal?

26:37.943 --> 26:39.411
What about you driving two hours

26:39.413 --> 26:40.613
to see your ex without telling me?

26:40.615 --> 26:42.517
Yeah, I never should have told you.

26:42.519 --> 26:45.356
Fine, but don't come after me
like I'm the one sneaking around

26:45.358 --> 26:47.026
like I'm the one who's lying.

26:47.028 --> 26:48.463
You're the one hiding things.

26:48.465 --> 26:50.300
We both are.

26:50.302 --> 26:52.604
What are we doing? This
isn't a relationship.

26:52.606 --> 26:55.376
This is an arrangement. We
don't even trust each other.

26:55.378 --> 26:56.812
I don't know if I'd call it...

26:56.814 --> 26:58.483
You live in a fucking
basement, and you come up

26:58.485 --> 27:00.286
when you feel like it, you
stay down when you feel like it.

27:00.288 --> 27:01.956
- And so do you.
- Yes, that's my point.

27:01.958 --> 27:03.259
We live completely separate lives.

27:03.261 --> 27:05.797
My place, your place, my bed, your bed,

27:05.799 --> 27:09.404
my kids, your... your... your cactus.

27:13.781 --> 27:16.117
You know, it's not normal, Vik.

27:16.119 --> 27:18.356
I know.

27:18.358 --> 27:20.994
But it's what you said you wanted.

27:20.996 --> 27:22.931
- You did say that, Helen.
- Yes, because I thought

27:22.933 --> 27:24.200
that's what you wanted.

27:24.202 --> 27:26.372
Okay, that's not fair.

27:26.374 --> 27:28.943
You never asked what I wanted.

27:28.945 --> 27:31.180
I took my cues from you.

27:31.182 --> 27:32.617
Now, you had been hurt,

27:32.619 --> 27:34.555
which you made pretty fucking clear,

27:34.557 --> 27:38.629
and I understood that... mostly.

27:38.631 --> 27:41.335
Look, I'm sorry, I don't
remember what I said before.

27:41.337 --> 27:44.508
I just... I know I can't...

27:44.510 --> 27:47.914
I can't...

27:47.916 --> 27:49.251
live like this anymore.

27:49.253 --> 27:52.056
I-I can't...

27:52.058 --> 27:54.361
do this anymore.

28:01.877 --> 28:04.817
Wait, that's it? You're going?

29:05.438 --> 29:07.676
Home sweet home.

29:21.069 --> 29:24.075
All right, he can live over here.

29:33.059 --> 29:34.895
- I do have one request.
- I know.

29:34.897 --> 29:36.899
You don't have to say it.
I'm done with him, really.

29:36.901 --> 29:38.903
Look.

29:38.905 --> 29:40.172
I understand.

29:40.174 --> 29:43.646
He is the father of your children.

29:43.648 --> 29:46.652
But I'd like if you could ease up.

29:47.856 --> 29:49.257
A little less lying.

29:49.259 --> 29:53.198
I get it, Vik. Really.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.603
I promise, no more. I mean it.

29:58.377 --> 30:01.047
Okay.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.051
I believe you.

30:06.360 --> 30:09.364
- Good night, Helen.
- Good night.

32:23.934 --> 32:25.938
Thank you.

32:39.231 --> 32:41.568
This is it. A bunch of
stuff came this week.

32:41.570 --> 32:44.039
Mom said to pile it here.

32:44.041 --> 32:46.043
Wow, it's brighter than it looked.

32:46.045 --> 32:47.480
Microwave's busted.

32:47.482 --> 32:49.484
I think she ordered a new one.

32:49.486 --> 32:51.388
Apart from that, you got your living room,

32:51.390 --> 32:54.527
kitchen, bedrooms and
bathroom down the hall.

32:54.529 --> 32:56.163
You need groceries or whatever,

32:56.165 --> 32:57.500
the IGA's on the highway.

32:57.502 --> 32:59.169
Just go down the hill, turn left.

32:59.171 --> 33:01.040
- Keep going, you'll hit town.
- Right.

33:01.042 --> 33:03.478
Pharmacy, hardware, post office,

33:03.480 --> 33:05.215
pretty much everything's
right there. Bagels.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.154
Those, those are my keys?

33:09.158 --> 33:11.126
- Top and bottom.
- Okay.

33:11.128 --> 33:12.997
And here.

33:12.999 --> 33:15.736
Coupon for Lockhart's Lobster Roll.

33:15.738 --> 33:18.709
Their cherry pie kicks ass.

33:18.711 --> 33:20.846
Thanks.

33:20.848 --> 33:23.150
- You need anything else or...
- No, no.

33:23.152 --> 33:25.856
No, I-I think I'm all set.

33:25.858 --> 33:28.864
All right. Welcome to Montauk.

34:54.201 --> 34:55.936
Joanie!

34:57.642 --> 34:59.009
Hey!

34:59.011 --> 35:00.479
Hey...!

35:00.481 --> 35:01.714
Man, you're getting big.

35:01.716 --> 35:03.285
Daddy!

35:06.827 --> 35:08.829
You good? Got the boots?

35:11.837 --> 35:12.837
Yep.

35:26.466 --> 35:28.133
<i>I couldn't do it.</i>

35:28.135 --> 35:31.039
No, I-I saw her just
now with Cole, and I...

35:31.041 --> 35:33.177
I didn't... I-I couldn't speak to him.

35:33.179 --> 35:36.183
I just... I froze and I...

35:36.185 --> 35:37.820
I-I don't know why.

35:37.822 --> 35:41.294
Or... or I do. I just... I...

35:42.465 --> 35:44.834
Yes.

35:44.836 --> 35:46.404
Yeah, okay.

35:46.406 --> 35:47.842
No.

35:49.244 --> 35:50.681
Just...

35:55.591 --> 35:57.595
I'm her mother.

35:59.766 --> 36:01.770
I made a mistake.

36:03.840 --> 36:05.844
But I'm still her mother.

36:09.552 --> 36:11.153
Okay.

36:11.155 --> 36:12.558
Yes.

36:14.729 --> 36:16.731
Thank you.

37:04.829 --> 37:06.833
Well, look who it is.

37:08.370 --> 37:10.374
Can I talk to you?

37:16.686 --> 37:18.690
Not here.

37:24.268 --> 37:26.437
Six fucking months.

37:26.439 --> 37:28.975
No explanation, no warning.

37:28.977 --> 37:31.146
You couldn't pick up a phone?
You couldn't write a letter?

37:31.148 --> 37:33.050
Did you ever stop to think
how that would feel to her?

37:33.052 --> 37:35.756
Yes. I... I have a lot to explain.

37:35.758 --> 37:37.292
And I will.

37:37.294 --> 37:38.828
Or I'll try to.

37:38.830 --> 37:41.066
- I just need to see Joanie.
- No fucking way.

37:41.068 --> 37:43.304
Are you kidding, Alison? You ju...

37:43.306 --> 37:45.308
you can't just come and go from her life.

37:45.310 --> 37:47.479
No, that's not what I'm doing.
I was sick, I-I had to go...

37:47.481 --> 37:50.117
She's four. There's no excuse.

37:50.119 --> 37:52.956
I know.

37:52.958 --> 37:55.027
I'm better now.

37:55.029 --> 37:58.635
And I'm back, and I'm not
going to leave her again.

37:58.637 --> 38:00.438
Look, please, Cole, let me see her

38:00.440 --> 38:02.778
or let me just hug her.

38:04.482 --> 38:06.284
I'm still her mother.

38:06.286 --> 38:08.288
She needs me.

38:23.954 --> 38:26.490
She'll be home at 5:00.
You can come by then.

38:26.492 --> 38:28.928
Thank... thank you.

38:41.356 --> 38:43.658
Alison Bailey.

38:43.660 --> 38:46.062
Am I seeing things?

38:46.064 --> 38:48.000
- Hi, Linda.
- Hey.

38:48.002 --> 38:50.137
Well, no one I'd rather have march in here.

38:50.139 --> 38:53.478
How you doing, sweetheart?

38:53.480 --> 38:55.849
- Did you get some rest?
- Yeah, tons.

38:55.851 --> 38:58.153
I... I'm a new woman.

38:58.155 --> 38:59.823
Well, that's more than I can claim.

39:01.362 --> 39:03.631
- How's Hank?
- Same grouchy self.

39:05.637 --> 39:07.104
- You here for your mail?
- Yeah.

39:07.106 --> 39:09.108
I-I-I don't know if
there's much, but...

39:09.110 --> 39:11.114
I'll go and grab it.

39:20.734 --> 39:23.504
Here you go.

39:23.506 --> 39:26.142
That's what you got.

39:26.144 --> 39:29.550
They come in

39:29.552 --> 39:32.558
one, two times a week.

39:38.235 --> 39:40.104
- I gotta go, Linda.
- Okay.

39:40.106 --> 39:41.507
Say hi to Hank for me, will you?

39:41.509 --> 39:43.176
- Okay, Alison.
- Okay, bye.

39:43.178 --> 39:44.382
Bye-bye.

40:31.976 --> 40:33.379
Hi.

40:44.234 --> 40:46.236
Wow, the place looks great.

40:46.238 --> 40:47.506
You did some work.

40:47.508 --> 40:48.908
Yeah, we painted a little bit.

40:48.910 --> 40:51.012
It's just temporary, though.

40:51.014 --> 40:52.716
We've got a lot over in Hither Hills.

40:52.718 --> 40:54.653
We're going to build a house.

40:54.655 --> 40:58.093
- We start in April.
- Wow, you must be doing well.

40:58.095 --> 41:01.032
Yeah, the Roll's busy. We're making money.

41:01.034 --> 41:03.203
And Caleb and Hal and I started
up a little contracting company.

41:03.205 --> 41:06.211
Where's Joanie? Is she here?

41:09.351 --> 41:12.789
Why don't you take a seat, Alison?

41:12.791 --> 41:14.628
She's at Cherry's.

41:16.198 --> 41:19.202
I know Cole told you you
could see her, but, um,

41:19.204 --> 41:23.477
he and I talked, and that can't happen.

41:23.479 --> 41:24.846
Wait, what?

41:24.848 --> 41:27.252
She's four. We can't do that to her.

41:27.254 --> 41:30.260
Not after everything she's been through.

41:32.731 --> 41:34.933
No, I...

41:34.935 --> 41:38.006
I need to see her, Luisa.

41:38.008 --> 41:39.509
Yeah, I-I know I hurt her,

41:39.511 --> 41:41.079
and I told Cole I'll explain everything.

41:41.081 --> 41:42.916
She asked for you every night.

41:42.918 --> 41:45.588
She cried for hours. For months.

41:45.590 --> 41:48.794
Look... you have to understand.

41:48.796 --> 41:50.932
I-I didn't have a choice.

41:50.934 --> 41:54.205
- What?
- Look, I...

41:54.207 --> 41:57.412
I needed to go. I
was... so worried about her.

41:57.414 --> 41:59.248
- About her?
- And I knew that she'd be safe

41:59.250 --> 42:01.420
with you. That you'd take care of her.

42:01.422 --> 42:04.828
- Which we did.
- I know, and I am so grateful.

42:08.201 --> 42:11.607
And I'm... I'm so sorry.

42:11.609 --> 42:15.581
Listen, Alison, I've tried
to be patient with you.

42:15.583 --> 42:17.886
When you suddenly
announced he was the father,

42:17.888 --> 42:20.458
after two years of
keeping that to yourself,

42:20.460 --> 42:21.794
I said okay.

42:21.796 --> 42:24.533
You want him in her life? Fine.

42:24.535 --> 42:27.439
You want to share custody of her? Fine.

42:27.441 --> 42:30.278
We'll share the Lobster
Roll. We'll share the child.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.582
We'll do whatever the hell you want.

42:32.584 --> 42:35.153
And then you just fucking disappear.

42:36.792 --> 42:41.266
To put your own child through that.

42:41.268 --> 42:44.740
There's something deeply wrong with you.

42:44.742 --> 42:47.679
Look,
she's... she's my daughter.

42:47.681 --> 42:50.318
You... you can't keep her from me.

42:50.320 --> 42:52.522
We can, actually.

42:55.129 --> 42:58.334
Wait... no.

43:00.139 --> 43:02.141
No, that's not fair.

43:02.143 --> 43:03.744
You signed the paperwork, Alison.

43:03.746 --> 43:06.950
That wasn't fair. I-I
wasn't in my right mind.

43:06.952 --> 43:08.052
I knew she was going to say that.

43:08.054 --> 43:09.656
We searched for you for months.

43:09.658 --> 43:11.326
We gave you the opportunity to come back.

43:11.328 --> 43:12.996
I wasn't well. You don't understand.

43:12.998 --> 43:14.800
- I-I couldn't...
- There was a lawyer present.

43:14.802 --> 43:16.169
Nobody forced you

43:16.171 --> 43:17.605
to sign anything.

43:20.346 --> 43:22.282
Look, I don't like doing this.

43:22.284 --> 43:24.319
I'm... I'm only asking to see her.

43:24.321 --> 43:26.857
I-I-I saw this dress.
It's... it's purple.

43:26.859 --> 43:28.126
It's her favorite.

43:28.128 --> 43:30.331
Joanie likes yellow now.

43:31.769 --> 43:33.203
Hey, Cole, please.

43:33.205 --> 43:35.675
She is doing so much better now, Alison.

43:35.677 --> 43:38.012
She's having less nightmares.
She's throwing less tantrums.

43:38.014 --> 43:40.217
Luisa's got her on a schedule.
She's going to school.

43:40.219 --> 43:42.989
She's got her friends, so... I'm sorry,

43:42.991 --> 43:45.661
but the answer's no.

43:45.663 --> 43:47.465
Please.

43:47.467 --> 43:50.203
Don't do this.

43:50.205 --> 43:52.207
You can't do this.

43:55.316 --> 43:56.583
We'll give that to her if you want.

43:56.585 --> 43:57.852
No.

44:19.998 --> 44:23.036
Alison Bailey.

44:23.038 --> 44:25.474
It's really you. Look at that.

44:25.476 --> 44:27.480
I thought you were dead.

44:29.885 --> 44:31.486
"It's nice to see you too, Oscar."

44:31.488 --> 44:34.191
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, come on, come on.

44:34.193 --> 44:37.265
- Can I give you a hug?
- No.

44:37.267 --> 44:39.269
- Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
- No, look, I...

44:39.271 --> 44:42.408
Why not? You got some place you gotta be?

44:42.410 --> 44:45.281
Why are you so happy?

44:45.283 --> 44:47.719
Jenny's pregnant.

44:47.721 --> 44:49.589
- My God.
- Yeah.

44:49.591 --> 44:52.261
- Congratulations... wow.
- Yeah.

44:52.263 --> 44:54.933
So come on, take me out to celebrate.

44:58.409 --> 44:59.809
Bailey?

44:59.811 --> 45:01.413
Clay, hey.

45:01.415 --> 45:03.350
My God. Sight for sore eyes.

45:03.352 --> 45:05.186
- How are you?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

45:05.188 --> 45:07.325
I'm happy to be home.

45:07.327 --> 45:09.896
Well, I'm happy too. What can I get you?

45:09.898 --> 45:10.998
Two screwdrivers.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.502
No, just an orange juice for me.

45:12.504 --> 45:13.771
Come on.

45:13.773 --> 45:14.939
What, you're gonna make me drink alone?

45:14.941 --> 45:16.576
You don't have to drink either.

45:16.578 --> 45:18.447
Yeah, okay.

45:18.449 --> 45:20.083
Fine. One screwdriver,

45:20.085 --> 45:21.853
one orange juice.

45:21.855 --> 45:23.859
Coming up.

45:34.281 --> 45:36.082
- So what the fuck happened?
- Nothing.

45:36.084 --> 45:39.956
Nothing? You disappeared for six months.

45:39.958 --> 45:42.060
- Did you join ISIS?
- No.

45:42.062 --> 45:43.464
I didn't think so, but you should know,

45:43.466 --> 45:46.403
that theory was circling
around here for a while.

45:46.405 --> 45:48.807
- Did you get kidnapped?
- No.

45:48.809 --> 45:50.745
Did you fall in love with a sailor?

45:50.747 --> 45:52.415
- Oscar.
- Did you have amnesia?

45:52.417 --> 45:55.421
Can you even remember what happened?

45:55.423 --> 45:59.194
Bailey, I was worried about you.

45:59.196 --> 46:01.800
The whole town was worried about you.

46:01.802 --> 46:04.405
You got a lot of people who love you here.

46:04.407 --> 46:06.411
Yeah, it's true.

46:11.087 --> 46:13.089
I just had to go away for a while.

46:13.091 --> 46:15.294
Yeah, that part I know.

46:15.296 --> 46:17.232
The question is why?

46:18.803 --> 46:22.742
Does it have anything to
do with Joanie turning four?

46:24.314 --> 46:27.320
I know you think I'm an
idiot, but I pay attention.

46:28.956 --> 46:31.526
Yeah.

46:31.528 --> 46:33.530
Yeah, it did have
something to do with that.

46:37.674 --> 46:40.477
I-I really don't know if I
should be talking about this.

46:40.479 --> 46:41.780
Why not?

46:41.782 --> 46:43.350
I don't know if Cole would want me to.

46:43.352 --> 46:44.886
If Cole would want you to?

46:44.888 --> 46:47.894
Did he say anything
about me while I was gone?

46:49.898 --> 46:52.337
He said you lost your mind.

46:54.173 --> 46:57.912
Screwdriver for the gentleman,
and a virgin for the lady.

46:57.914 --> 46:59.751
Thanks, Clay.

47:02.323 --> 47:04.692
He says I can't see her now.

47:04.694 --> 47:08.267
That I'm not fit to be alone with her.

47:08.269 --> 47:11.640
- Okay, well, he can't do that.
- No, he can.

47:11.642 --> 47:13.343
I signed these papers.

47:13.345 --> 47:15.614
- What papers?
- At the institute.

47:15.616 --> 47:16.883
What institute? What are you talking about?

47:16.885 --> 47:18.322
I...

47:22.864 --> 47:27.203
You remember last winter and
it just never stopped snowing?

47:27.205 --> 47:29.542
- Yeah, I was here.
- Yeah.

47:29.544 --> 47:32.915
When Joanie got that bad
flu that was going around,

47:32.917 --> 47:37.358
and she got really sick
and I was alone with her.

47:37.360 --> 47:39.996
You know, Cole and I were
technically splitting time,

47:39.998 --> 47:42.067
but he had this big job

47:42.069 --> 47:45.674
and I just didn't want to hassle him.

47:45.676 --> 47:48.682
And Luisa hates me, so, you know.

47:52.256 --> 47:55.260
I... I should have called him.

47:55.262 --> 47:56.863
Why? What happened?

47:56.865 --> 47:58.300
Joanie wasn't getting better.

47:58.302 --> 48:02.541
She had this terrible fever for a week.

48:02.543 --> 48:04.213
Maybe more.

48:06.017 --> 48:10.557
And... I freaked.

48:10.559 --> 48:13.162
I freaked out, Oscar.

48:16.003 --> 48:19.442
I thought... I must be
doing something wrong.

48:19.444 --> 48:22.448
It must be me, um.

48:22.450 --> 48:24.719
And I know it sounds ridiculous,

48:24.721 --> 48:27.425
when I tried to explain,
you know, she's a kid.

48:27.427 --> 48:31.031
They get sick. They get very sick.

48:31.033 --> 48:33.570
But like you said, she
was the same age as Gabriel

48:33.572 --> 48:35.407
when he, um...

48:38.415 --> 48:41.151
And I started to see these...

48:43.392 --> 48:45.794
I... I don't know

48:45.796 --> 48:48.165
quite how to describe it,

48:48.167 --> 48:51.606
but I...

48:51.608 --> 48:54.010
started seeing flashes

48:54.012 --> 48:56.282
of things that could happen to her.

48:58.288 --> 49:00.457
Like things that weren't real.

49:00.459 --> 49:02.628
Yeah, that sounds bad.

49:02.630 --> 49:05.801
Yeah, it was.

49:05.803 --> 49:10.410
And one night, she'd been
sick for ten days maybe.

49:10.412 --> 49:12.748
She wouldn't eat.

49:12.750 --> 49:15.821
She would barely drink.

49:15.823 --> 49:19.562
And I knew that it was my fault.

49:19.564 --> 49:23.135
I was convinced that if she stayed with me,

49:23.137 --> 49:24.839
she would die.

49:26.578 --> 49:29.782
And so I bundled her up and I...

49:29.784 --> 49:31.753
I took her to Cole in
the middle of the night

49:31.755 --> 49:34.625
and I told him

49:34.627 --> 49:37.965
that I would be back in a few days.

49:37.967 --> 49:40.437
Then you went to that institute?

49:42.810 --> 49:44.445
Yeah.

49:44.447 --> 49:46.883
I took all the money that
I had from Lobster Roll

49:46.885 --> 49:48.720
and I asked them to help me.

49:48.722 --> 49:51.292
- Did they?
- Yeah.

49:54.233 --> 49:56.469
Yeah. It was kind of a miracle.

49:56.471 --> 49:57.805
They did.

50:00.312 --> 50:02.915
So now, what happened with Cole?

50:09.196 --> 50:12.534
I gave him custody of her.

50:12.536 --> 50:14.538
- Why?
- I don't know.

50:14.540 --> 50:18.178
It was so stupid, but I was
in such a bad way, Oscar.

50:18.180 --> 50:20.584
You know, I was afraid that
I was... it wasn't gonna end.

50:20.586 --> 50:22.788
I was afraid that I would
be in that place forever,

50:22.790 --> 50:26.028
and I just... I...

50:26.030 --> 50:27.631
I was worried about

50:27.633 --> 50:29.302
what would happen to
Joanie if that was the case,

50:29.304 --> 50:32.474
and so I... God, it was only
supposed to be temporary.

50:32.476 --> 50:35.647
Just until I got out.

50:35.649 --> 50:37.451
I never thought in a million years

50:37.453 --> 50:40.624
that he would try and keep her from me.

50:45.402 --> 50:48.238
Okay, look.

50:52.450 --> 50:54.117
I've known you both for a long time.

50:54.119 --> 50:55.420
You're both good people.

50:55.422 --> 50:58.192
But you're both stubborn as fuck.

50:58.194 --> 51:00.162
And you both kicked the shit
out of me, at different times,

51:00.164 --> 51:01.432
in different ways.

51:01.434 --> 51:03.636
So, I'm telling you this as a friend,

51:03.638 --> 51:05.407
someone who cares about you,

51:05.409 --> 51:07.945
and who is also a little afraid of you,

51:07.947 --> 51:10.953
and very afraid of your ex-husband.

51:13.558 --> 51:16.429
All you need...

51:16.431 --> 51:19.268
is a good lawyer.

51:21.741 --> 51:23.743
Right?

51:25.315 --> 51:26.749
Yeah.

51:30.959 --> 51:32.795
Cheers.

51:32.797 --> 51:34.097
I gonna have that one actually.

53:08.087 --> 53:10.189
My God, sweetheart.

53:11.894 --> 53:14.230
God.

53:14.232 --> 53:17.203
I've missed you so much.

53:19.209 --> 53:20.577
Hey.

53:22.716 --> 53:25.687
I'm sorry I've been gone so long.

53:28.428 --> 53:30.296
- Do you want to see your room?
- Is it this way?

53:30.298 --> 53:32.300
Yeah, go.

53:36.043 --> 53:37.245
Thank you.

53:38.247 --> 53:40.249
Thank you.

53:40.251 --> 53:44.057
I'm not doing this for
you. I'm doing it for her.

53:44.059 --> 53:45.827
You got one hour.
