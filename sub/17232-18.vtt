WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:03.489
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:03.523 --> 00:05.048
I would like to toast Scarlett O'Connor,

00:05.056 --> 00:06.949
the first artist to sign to Rayna's label.

00:07.254 --> 00:08.685
- Hey.
- Travel day.

00:08.716 --> 00:10.413
And you missed me.

00:10.533 --> 00:11.933
Daddy, I just feel

00:11.954 --> 00:13.385
like we missed our life together,

00:13.400 --> 00:15.051
and I don't blame you for that.

00:15.171 --> 00:17.373
Scarlett may have had
enough fun for one night,

00:17.405 --> 00:18.773
but you have not.

00:18.818 --> 00:20.402
I'm not interested in chasing skirts.

00:20.436 --> 00:21.736
That's not what I had in mind.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.905
The band's not thrilled
about adding the new songs.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.740
Too bad. You're the boss.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.308
- What's this?
- Phone records.

00:27.326 --> 00:30.879
Peggy Kenter, your girlfriend...
she was the leak, Teddy.

00:37.635 --> 00:39.538
All right, we're wheels up in an hour.

00:39.589 --> 00:42.958
Sayonara, Cincinnati.
Bienvenidos, Nashville.

00:42.992 --> 00:44.833
You know that's two
different languages, right?

00:44.844 --> 00:48.630
So Emily said that I have
to move out of the house.

00:48.664 --> 00:49.998
Guess the owners are coming back.

00:50.016 --> 00:51.266
Why are you still renting?

00:51.300 --> 00:52.801
I don't know.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.469
I just thought that
when I bought something,

00:54.503 --> 00:57.772
I'd have somebody to share it with.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.808
I know it's silly. It's stupid.

01:00.008 --> 01:01.942
Not at all.

01:01.977 --> 01:05.880
I get wanting to share a
big moment with someone.

01:07.983 --> 01:10.117
You wanna go house huntin'?

01:10.152 --> 01:12.403
Is that a proposition?

01:12.454 --> 01:14.572
Maybe.

01:17.459 --> 01:19.026
Then maybe yes.

01:20.088 --> 01:21.708
I have some friends in real estate.

01:21.828 --> 01:24.298
Put some feelers out.
Check some places out.

01:24.999 --> 01:26.834
Turn that shower back on.

01:26.868 --> 01:28.748
I thought you said we
were wheels up in an hour.

01:28.866 --> 01:30.471
Well, it's my plane.

01:30.505 --> 01:32.401
We're wheels up when I say we are.

01:37.087 --> 01:38.233
What are you reading?

01:38.276 --> 01:39.603
My brother's journal.

01:39.638 --> 01:41.255
Found it in his bag.

01:41.273 --> 01:43.691
It's got a bunch of lyrics and, uh,

01:43.725 --> 01:45.845
stuff like that.

01:46.778 --> 01:48.395
Feels good to have it, though.

01:53.768 --> 01:55.455
Dude!

01:58.006 --> 01:59.938
- Got my first gig!
- Yeah?

01:59.960 --> 02:01.424
Some bar down on Lower Broad.

02:01.443 --> 02:02.512
- Yeah?
- 11:30 tomorrow.

02:02.531 --> 02:04.662
- Ah. A.M.?
- Yeah.

02:04.713 --> 02:06.380
- Yeah.
- What...

02:06.431 --> 02:07.431
Where's your truck?

02:07.742 --> 02:10.351
Oh, I traded it in for this.

02:12.316 --> 02:13.317
Wanna take it for a spin?

02:13.335 --> 02:15.243
Hell, yes, I do.

02:15.363 --> 02:16.857
Don't forget your songs for Jeanne.

02:16.892 --> 02:18.071
Yeah, I'll get around to that.

02:18.077 --> 02:19.407
Be careful.

02:19.735 --> 02:21.428
- Dude, this is awesome.
- Yep.

02:21.462 --> 02:22.895
That's unbelievable.

02:22.902 --> 02:24.663
She didn't say a word
to us the whole flight.

02:24.916 --> 02:26.962
Oh! You're just not used to it.

02:26.987 --> 02:28.758
She treats the rest of
us like that regularly.

02:28.764 --> 02:31.179
Yeah. At least we had a chance
to catch up, though, huh?

02:31.299 --> 02:32.949
Yeah, we did. It was fun this week.

02:32.956 --> 02:35.004
Yeah, it was. It was, yeah.

02:35.398 --> 02:37.071
See you later. Have a good one.

02:37.794 --> 02:39.953
So the show's not till the
day after tomorrow... - Hey, darlin'.

02:39.978 --> 02:41.177
- And then, uh, and then we
got a couple days off... - Hi.

02:41.178 --> 02:43.350
Give
everybody a chance to breathe.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.252
I didn't know if you wanted
me to book you up solid...

02:45.372 --> 02:46.753
Hi. I missed you.
Or keep your schedule clear.

02:46.873 --> 02:49.425
Well, you know, I don't
have the girls this week,

02:49.432 --> 02:50.376
and...

02:50.702 --> 02:52.454
shoot. We got days off in Nashville.

02:52.472 --> 02:54.018
Let's finally get together with Scarlett.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.004
Right. Let's call Liam,
see if he's available.

02:56.026 --> 02:58.010
Even tonight, we could try
to get that album knocked out.

02:58.066 --> 03:01.544
Oh, man, I love it when you
talk that way. Oh, I know you do.

03:05.361 --> 03:06.850
Hi, baby. Welcome home.

03:06.881 --> 03:09.069
Hi, mama. What are you doing here?

03:09.070 --> 03:10.840
Well, Emily said that you were coming home,

03:10.841 --> 03:12.521
so I certainly wanna be here to greet you.

03:12.542 --> 03:13.143
Thanks.

03:13.180 --> 03:15.076
Uh, how's your new place? I love it.

03:15.132 --> 03:17.066
It's great, but if I could, um, talk to you

03:17.084 --> 03:18.942
for just a minute. I really...

03:18.992 --> 03:20.669
Oh, we already discussed
why that's not an option.

03:20.694 --> 03:21.739
I mean, you're supposed to be working

03:21.777 --> 03:22.734
with your new sober companion.

03:22.771 --> 03:24.780
Yeah, but I don't like her.
I'd rather work with you.

03:24.786 --> 03:26.932
You know, mama, this
isn't respecting boundaries

03:26.933 --> 03:27.970
like we talked about.

03:28.090 --> 03:30.305
Okay? You gotta go to your apartment.

03:30.324 --> 03:32.100
Dante and I have an appointment.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.043
Okay? Mm-hmm.

03:39.896 --> 03:42.017
Between this spread and the stadium,

03:42.035 --> 03:44.213
we are so excited to be
partnering with Subway

03:44.219 --> 03:44.974
on this deal.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.578
I'll tell you, it feels
like the perfect marriage.

03:46.647 --> 03:47.742
Well, we are excited

03:47.761 --> 03:50.263
about moving forward with subway field.

03:50.270 --> 03:52.034
You know, athletes who work with us

03:52.053 --> 03:54.130
have a legacy of winning
world championships.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.062
That's what I hear.

03:55.087 --> 03:57.566
Hopefully, the same will
happen for this team.

03:57.601 --> 03:59.610
We'll keep you apprised of our progress.

03:59.667 --> 04:02.201
Great. Nice to meet you. Thanks so much.

04:03.997 --> 04:06.137
Well, that went well. Sure did.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.164
It's just too bad that Lamar's company

04:08.170 --> 04:11.211
will still get some of the
work from their Metro contracts.

04:11.223 --> 04:13.099
There's no way around that.

04:13.895 --> 04:15.847
Excuse me, Mr. mayor. Do you have a minute?

04:15.879 --> 04:18.257
Oh, look, I'll, uh, see
you in the council meeting.

04:19.620 --> 04:21.089
Thanks, Cole. Sure.

04:28.217 --> 04:28.731
Hi.

04:29.587 --> 04:32.459
Hey. Hey, hey. We, uh, we
need to keep it discreet.

04:32.503 --> 04:34.923
Oh, come on. I haven't seen you all week.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.000
Well, I've been busy.

04:37.627 --> 04:39.297
Well, can we at least have dinner?

04:40.067 --> 04:40.860
A drink?

04:40.980 --> 04:42.638
I have your lawyer on line two.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.559
Look, I have the girls, so, um...

04:45.986 --> 04:47.793
I'll try and call you later.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.507
Okay.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.010
Teddy Conrad.

04:56.413 --> 04:57.847
Yeah, I can meet you.

04:57.882 --> 04:59.943
Can I do something? I...

04:59.987 --> 05:02.014
You should sit, sit. I can't believe...

05:02.186 --> 05:03.891
I can't believe you didn't
let me bring anything.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.479
Please, all she did was dial a phone.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.532
Hey, why cook if the world delivers, right?

05:07.732 --> 05:10.022
I've seen him eat cold
spaghetti straight from a can.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.526
You don't have to tell
her all my secrets.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.126
Where's Gunnar?

05:14.665 --> 05:15.503
On his way.

05:15.623 --> 05:17.437
Oh, well, he should hurry up

05:17.474 --> 05:20.822
before I eat his egg rolls. Oh, plates.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.134
Everything all right between you two?

05:23.944 --> 05:26.121
Oh...  I think

05:26.428 --> 05:29.250
me seeing Rayna on my own turned
things upside down a little bit,

05:29.287 --> 05:30.582
but it'll be fine.

05:30.758 --> 05:31.984
You ought to talk to Rayna about it.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.180
There's something you
want, you gotta ask for it.

05:34.374 --> 05:35.081
Well...

05:35.150 --> 05:37.652
Okay, y'all just keep visiting.
I will get that. All right.

05:37.709 --> 05:39.491
Didn't that sound a little
Southern when I said that?

05:40.392 --> 05:41.462
Okay, can you keep her?

05:41.493 --> 05:43.883
'Cause you're happy,
and she's lovely. Yeah.

05:43.914 --> 05:44.659
Hi. You must be
Stacey.  Hi. I am.

05:44.665 --> 05:45.753
She's a good girl.

05:52.217 --> 05:54.369
Thank you for showing
up last minute tonight.

05:56.315 --> 05:59.575
Sure. I'll take time with
you whenever I can get it.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.922
In that case, why don't you play the
Nashville show with me?

06:03.116 --> 06:05.116
You miss being out onstage with me?

06:06.594 --> 06:07.694
I will admit,

06:07.814 --> 06:10.066
it is very fun being onstage with you.

06:10.186 --> 06:12.512
We have a great time. Good.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.158
Yeah.

06:14.195 --> 06:15.915
I'm happy to see you're
doing so much better

06:15.916 --> 06:17.296
than the last time I saw you.

06:17.737 --> 06:19.115
Wow.

06:19.150 --> 06:20.840
Wouldn't be hard to improve on that,

06:21.047 --> 06:23.870
since I was sobbing all
over a bathroom floor.

06:24.487 --> 06:25.355
True.

06:25.389 --> 06:27.365
Ugh. Yeah, nothing like having your father

06:27.371 --> 06:28.654
almost drop dead of a heart attack

06:28.666 --> 06:30.844
to kind of give you some
perspective on things.

06:30.878 --> 06:32.162
Mm.

06:32.715 --> 06:35.686
I just wanna live in the moment.

06:37.288 --> 06:39.334
I feel freer than I ever have, really.

06:40.341 --> 06:41.630

Oh, hey.

06:59.592 --> 07:01.025
Hey. Hey.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.809
How's... how's everything going in there?

07:02.843 --> 07:03.843
Good. Good.

07:04.866 --> 07:06.312
Awesome.

08:18.479 --> 08:20.450
Don't forget to tip your band.

08:23.460 --> 08:24.666
How y'all doin'? Hey.

08:24.735 --> 08:25.793
What's up?  Dude, that was awesome.

08:25.811 --> 08:27.595
Thanks for comin'. Excuse me.

08:27.651 --> 08:29.034
Can I have your autograph?

08:29.096 --> 08:31.498
Well, why don't you give me
your phone number instead?

08:34.871 --> 08:36.879
Thank you. Thank you.

08:36.999 --> 08:38.198
Don't know how you do it, man.

08:38.249 --> 08:39.932
I got a system. Oh, yeah?

08:39.995 --> 08:42.979
She entered on the phone, uh,
her actual name, which is Kelly.

08:43.099 --> 08:44.643
I'm gonna change it to, uh,

08:44.763 --> 08:46.707
"Kelly, fake blonde, smallish boobs."

08:46.739 --> 08:47.621
So I'll remember her.

08:47.677 --> 08:50.030
That's impressive in a
kind of messed up way,

08:50.063 --> 08:51.181
but I'm not talking about the girls, man.

08:51.212 --> 08:53.283
I'm talking about the stage. You killed it.

08:53.340 --> 08:55.760
I mean, I must have
performed a million times,

08:55.986 --> 08:59.314
but never with that
much...  swagger.

08:59.434 --> 09:01.616
Just can't do it. Sure, you can.

09:01.659 --> 09:02.610
No.

09:02.730 --> 09:04.656
Grab yourself a beer, man.

09:04.725 --> 09:06.089
I'm gonna get you told.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.955
Let's just be careful of this step.

09:09.075 --> 09:11.871
I know where the damn step is.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.236
Been walking over it my entire life. Okay.

09:14.492 --> 09:16.094
All right, well, we've
got you set up down here

09:16.119 --> 09:17.826
so that you don't have
to deal with the stairs.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.442
And I don't want you
to worry about anything at work,

09:20.498 --> 09:22.082
because I've got everything
handled at the company.

09:22.202 --> 09:24.703
You know last I checked,
it was my company.

09:25.823 --> 09:28.995
I am neither dead nor doddering.

09:29.627 --> 09:31.630
Stop acting like I am.

09:33.851 --> 09:35.978
Well, hello, darlin'. What is your name?

09:36.322 --> 09:39.200
I just love that you're staying with me.

09:39.457 --> 09:41.453
It feels like when we were little kids.

09:41.484 --> 09:43.906
I know. We can drink
wine and not get grounded.

09:43.962 --> 09:44.919
Mm-hmm.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.133
So... I kissed Liam.

09:49.354 --> 09:50.724
What? I know.

09:50.781 --> 09:52.983
Ex... wait. Ex... hang
on there now.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.848
I'm gonna need some
more details about this.

09:54.891 --> 09:57.263
It just kinda happened. We made out.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.684
Well, do you want it to
just kinda happen again?

10:00.483 --> 10:01.642
I don't know.

10:01.762 --> 10:02.950
Oh, my gosh.

10:02.981 --> 10:03.970
He is really hot.

10:03.995 --> 10:05.440
So just have a little fling.

10:06.339 --> 10:07.861
Right. What's the problem?

10:07.924 --> 10:09.062
No, no problem.

10:09.131 --> 10:11.352
It's fantastic. It's fun.
It's also really scary.

10:11.384 --> 10:13.592
I mean, I'm making all the
choices for the first time.

10:14.462 --> 10:15.996
We went to second base.

10:16.689 --> 10:18.522
Does that make me slutty?

10:22.289 --> 10:23.577
Juliette?

10:23.578 --> 10:25.205
Look what I found for you.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.606
For us.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.164
For us.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.532
- No pool, but...
- And how many square feet?

10:33.533 --> 10:35.334
Looks like 6,500. 6,500.

10:35.341 --> 10:36.123
Yeah. That's big.

10:36.154 --> 10:37.205
- That's...
- That's really big.

10:37.230 --> 10:38.682
Excuse me. Good size.

10:39.145 --> 10:41.003
I was hoping maybe we could
go through "undermine."

10:41.028 --> 10:42.308
Why don't you guys just do it...

10:42.368 --> 10:44.288
run through it one more time by yourselves?

10:44.307 --> 10:46.053
Look, these people have lives

10:46.090 --> 10:48.606
and families they haven't
seen in a long time, so...

10:48.662 --> 10:50.326
Okay, and is that my fault?

10:50.351 --> 10:52.078
Of course not. I mean,
everybody's happy to work.

10:52.091 --> 10:54.546
It's just... doesn't seem
like you want to today.

10:54.581 --> 10:56.843
- I work harder than anybody here.
- Well, I don't know about...

10:56.844 --> 10:57.876
Why don't you stop complaining

10:57.915 --> 10:59.236
and get back to leading the band?

10:59.239 --> 11:00.449
You wanna try that?

11:01.625 --> 11:03.402
Can I talk to you a second?

11:03.927 --> 11:05.561
We're talkin'.

11:07.447 --> 11:09.465
Look, you're not listening to me,

11:09.471 --> 11:10.922
and I'm sure as hell
not gonna listen to him,

11:10.941 --> 11:13.219
- so, uh...
- So what? What?

11:15.652 --> 11:17.385
Maybe I just need to be done here.

11:18.606 --> 11:20.452
I'll finish off this
leg of the tour, but...

11:21.484 --> 11:23.517
you should probably get
yourself a new bandleader.

11:23.830 --> 11:25.915
It's fine. You're replaceable.

11:32.075 --> 11:33.977
All right, that's it,
guys. We're done today.

11:34.265 --> 11:35.705
Head on home. Good seeing everybody.

11:35.910 --> 11:37.968
- I'm sorry it took a whole week. It's...
- No.

11:37.993 --> 11:39.270
I wanted to be thorough. It's all right.

11:39.278 --> 11:40.542
Well, I appreciate you doing this.

11:40.565 --> 11:42.391
Ah, you've been a client
and a friend forever.

11:42.431 --> 11:45.563
I don't mind putting the firm's
resources at your disposal.

11:46.313 --> 11:47.768
The phone records are real.

11:47.802 --> 11:50.079
Nothing forged or questionable.

11:50.199 --> 11:52.144
P.I. talked to the reporter.

11:52.519 --> 11:54.070
Guy wouldn't give up his source.

11:54.102 --> 11:57.017
But he did say it was
someone "close to the mayor."

12:00.383 --> 12:02.116
It's gotta be a mistake.

12:02.529 --> 12:04.485
Peggy was the leak.

12:08.417 --> 12:11.176
I'm just so
excited to finally be here.

12:11.358 --> 12:14.967
I'm excited just to go through
your music and... and, uh,

12:15.324 --> 12:17.099
figure out what we're gonna
use for your first single.

12:17.132 --> 12:19.433
And I think we should start
talking about setting up a tour.

12:19.468 --> 12:21.266
Wow. Okay. Yeah.

12:21.303 --> 12:22.561
Um...

12:23.005 --> 12:24.933
there was one thing that I really
wanted to talk to you about,

12:24.945 --> 12:26.340
and I don't...

12:26.460 --> 12:28.824
I don't wanna seem out of line.

12:29.788 --> 12:31.438
Gunnar didn't turn up to the audition

12:31.439 --> 12:33.786
because he had a death in
the family the day before.

12:33.824 --> 12:35.676
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.874
What made me think about it
was something that you said

12:38.172 --> 12:40.593
at Deacon's party... that
there would be no Rayna Jaymes

12:40.618 --> 12:42.057
without Deacon Claybourne.

12:42.908 --> 12:44.722
There would be no me without Gunnar.

12:47.150 --> 12:50.216
Owning a room is all about
your connection with the ladies.

12:50.397 --> 12:52.293
Okay? They want a little bit less,

12:52.336 --> 12:54.688
uh, "guy who used to
crush on me in algebra,"

12:54.689 --> 12:55.783
- a little bit more...
- Hey, hey.

12:55.815 --> 12:58.317
Bad boy who they wanted hook
up with under the bleachers,

12:58.349 --> 12:59.137
you know?

12:59.175 --> 13:00.575
Check it out. Come here.

13:01.921 --> 13:03.023
We're onstage,

13:03.060 --> 13:04.189
and this is the house, okay?

13:04.223 --> 13:06.933
You gotta section off the
room into different sections,

13:06.952 --> 13:09.185
and you find the prettiest
girl in each one. Boom.

13:09.229 --> 13:09.980
Right there.

13:10.100 --> 13:13.096
That girl has gotta think
you are singing just to her.

13:13.108 --> 13:14.829
She's gotta think you're
gonna walk off the stage

13:14.860 --> 13:16.168
and run away with her after the show.

13:16.211 --> 13:18.508
All right, well, how about
next time I play an arena,

13:18.628 --> 13:19.590
I give it a try?

13:19.710 --> 13:21.139
Screw arenas, man.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.225
Open mic night tonight at Tootsies.

13:23.513 --> 13:25.263
Oh, no. I...

13:25.383 --> 13:27.529
They are gonna love you.

13:28.948 --> 13:31.171
Juliette, I need to
talk to you for a minute.

13:31.291 --> 13:33.683
What... what are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

13:33.684 --> 13:36.300
I need to talk to you, and
I'm sure that he knows why.

13:36.420 --> 13:39.197
I saw you kissing another woman.

13:47.268 --> 13:49.139
What makes you think it's okay for you

13:49.145 --> 13:51.748
to come in here and make
these crazy accusations?

13:51.868 --> 13:54.288
I saw him making out with
a woman on lower broad.

13:54.307 --> 13:56.165
He... he was not on lower broad...

13:56.184 --> 13:57.441
No, no, actually I was.

13:57.510 --> 13:59.049
I met a friend, Esme, down there

13:59.093 --> 14:00.445
who I sponsored a few years back.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.028
She's a realtor, okay? She
helped me find that house

14:03.054 --> 14:04.367
I wanted to show you.

14:04.487 --> 14:06.439
The thing that most
concerns me is the fact that

14:06.470 --> 14:08.159
apparently you've been following me?

14:09.173 --> 14:09.736
Well...

14:09.856 --> 14:11.217
- You're stalking him.
- No.

14:11.337 --> 14:12.112
Yes, you are.

14:12.113 --> 14:13.421
No, I just wanted to get him alone

14:13.428 --> 14:14.909
so that I could talk to him.

14:14.910 --> 14:16.208
Wanted to get me alone. Are you so obsessed

14:16.224 --> 14:17.757
that you think it's a
good idea to come in here

14:17.782 --> 14:19.280
and tell me this fake story?

14:19.298 --> 14:20.848
That's not what this is about.

14:20.892 --> 14:22.548
- I came here to...
- You get out.

14:22.668 --> 14:25.336
And if you don't, I'll have you thrown out.

14:29.276 --> 14:31.997
Hey, Sarah. Been a long time.

14:31.998 --> 14:33.643
Got the sheet for open mic night?

14:33.674 --> 14:35.795
Sorry, we're full up.
Gotta get here earlier.

14:35.915 --> 14:36.665

I got you something.

16:09.575 --> 16:10.451
You did?

16:10.488 --> 16:13.273
Yeah. Well, us. Reservations.

16:13.295 --> 16:15.343
Ooh. What restaurant?

16:15.463 --> 16:17.024
Well, they... they probably have food,

16:17.065 --> 16:18.432
but it's not a restaurant.

16:20.004 --> 16:21.599
It's first class to St. Lucia.

16:21.656 --> 16:23.883
You got us plane tickets to the Caribbean?

16:23.889 --> 16:25.097
No, I got reservations.

16:25.122 --> 16:27.775
But you say yes, I'll buy the tickets.

16:27.895 --> 16:31.504
Sugar beach, black sand,
blue ocean. It's hot.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.306
I can't... When? I can't just...

16:33.812 --> 16:36.151
- take off with you to St. Lucia.
- Why not?

16:36.182 --> 16:38.016
You're getting a divorce. It's official.

16:38.072 --> 16:41.701
But I have kids, and my dad
just got out of the hospital.

16:41.720 --> 16:42.427
Uh-huh.

16:42.483 --> 16:44.097
And we're on tour.

16:44.098 --> 16:46.819
You got a couple days off
from the tour after this show.

16:46.838 --> 16:47.670
Mm-hmm.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.071
And don't tell me you don't have someone

16:49.191 --> 16:50.905
you can trust with your kids.

16:53.314 --> 16:55.414
I thought you said you
wanted to live in the moment.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.849
I do... would you just
stop throwing my words

16:57.881 --> 16:59.445
- back in my face?
-  Okay.

16:59.502 --> 17:01.940
I'm thinking about it. All right.

17:02.521 --> 17:03.691
Just say "yes."

17:03.741 --> 17:05.186
Ohh.

17:10.598 --> 17:11.662
Hey. Mm?

17:11.699 --> 17:13.607
Perfectly acceptable dinner.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.385
Yes, you spoil me.

17:15.419 --> 17:16.892
A girl could get used to that.

17:16.904 --> 17:18.525
Well, maybe you'd better,

17:18.538 --> 17:20.877
'cause I told Juliette
that I am done with the tour

17:20.877 --> 17:21.799
at the end of this leg.

17:21.867 --> 17:23.130
What? Why?

17:23.167 --> 17:23.756
You know what?

17:23.773 --> 17:26.246
I have had enough crazy for two lifetimes.

17:26.258 --> 17:27.134
I think it's time

17:27.165 --> 17:29.604
I lived in the real
world for a little while.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.207
Is that okay?

17:38.088 --> 17:40.453
Thank you. Get back to work.

17:42.537 --> 17:45.052
All the furniture's for sale, too.

17:45.608 --> 17:48.323
So... do you love it?

17:49.224 --> 17:50.358
I do.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.441
What's wrong?

17:54.396 --> 17:56.156
You're worried about
your mother, aren't you?

17:56.220 --> 17:58.382
That was just very bizarre behavior.

17:59.253 --> 18:03.414
Yeah, it was. We just
gotta keep an eye on her,

18:03.476 --> 18:05.806
make sure she doesn't
relapse if she hasn't already.

18:06.817 --> 18:09.038
Uh, I gotta take this.

18:09.082 --> 18:11.190
The lying worries me, though.

18:11.942 --> 18:13.243
Hello?

18:14.313 --> 18:16.334
Em, what do you think of this mirror?

18:17.223 --> 18:19.112
I think she likes it. Yeah.

18:19.613 --> 18:20.407
It's nice.

18:20.439 --> 18:23.060
- Uh, I'm not sure about the furniture.
-  It's heinous.

18:23.180 --> 18:25.431
But that's not why I called you over here.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.746
How many square feet was the, uh, master?

18:27.771 --> 18:28.590
She... she had asked me...

18:28.640 --> 18:30.693
I would like to talk to this Esme.

18:31.181 --> 18:33.251
Can we get her passes
to tomorrow night's show?

18:33.708 --> 18:34.665
Yeah, of course.

18:36.743 --> 18:38.964
That's good. That is good. Man! Whoo!

18:39.327 --> 18:40.384
Oh, man.

18:45.294 --> 18:47.409
Here's my number.

18:47.672 --> 18:49.148
Call me.

18:52.672 --> 18:54.773
What just happened?

18:54.817 --> 18:58.195
I wish... I wish you could
see your face right now.

18:58.315 --> 19:01.161
Wow.  Man.

19:01.186 --> 19:03.864
Excuse me. Hey, I'm Jack Nelson.

19:03.984 --> 19:04.732
Hey.

19:04.733 --> 19:06.491
You're the Jack Nelson who
worked with Lindi Ortega.

19:06.611 --> 19:08.668
Will Lexington. How you doin'?

19:08.788 --> 19:10.938
Listen, that performance tonight was great.

19:10.963 --> 19:12.963
Thank you. That song was
amazing. Did you write it?

19:13.048 --> 19:14.417
Uh, y-yeah, I did.

19:14.442 --> 19:16.319
I'd love to lay it down as a demo.

19:16.439 --> 19:17.714
Why don't you call me tomorrow?

19:17.758 --> 19:18.690
I'll set it up.

19:18.752 --> 19:20.886
Yeah, all right.

19:21.006 --> 19:22.913
You know who that was?

19:22.945 --> 19:24.571
Oh, man. Oh, my God.

19:24.609 --> 19:25.986
Oh, man.

19:26.424 --> 19:27.707
Wow.

19:28.495 --> 19:30.426
Damn. Hey, are you gonna use this?

19:30.709 --> 19:31.941
What do you think? No.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.092
All right. That's what I figured.

19:33.111 --> 19:35.932
Yeah, you go knock yourself out.

19:37.985 --> 19:40.486
That was an incredible song.

19:41.338 --> 19:42.928
Thanks, man.

19:46.960 --> 19:49.445
Listen, I'm... I'm sorry about
what happened at the house.

19:49.783 --> 19:52.667
I was... I was out of line

19:52.674 --> 19:53.950
with you and Scarlett.

19:54.070 --> 19:56.521
We weren't together then,
but we are now, so...

19:57.785 --> 20:01.170
You hear she got a
record deal with Edgehill?

20:01.290 --> 20:03.266
No. I hadn't.

20:04.624 --> 20:07.029
Well... good luck with that song.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.551
Daddy?

20:13.221 --> 20:14.629
Yeah, I'm in here.

20:15.754 --> 20:17.194
What happened here?

20:17.638 --> 20:20.941
Oh, I was just... I'm just taking stock.

20:23.875 --> 20:26.603
Gosh. What is all this?

20:26.935 --> 20:31.183
Well, I didn't...
always approve of your choices,

20:31.245 --> 20:32.966
but...

20:33.441 --> 20:35.393
I still followed your career.

20:36.914 --> 20:38.359
I didn't know that.

20:44.947 --> 20:47.055
Watty told me about...

20:47.343 --> 20:49.151
all that stuff with mom.

20:50.039 --> 20:51.365
You know I had no idea

20:51.378 --> 20:53.007
how difficult all that was for you.

20:53.041 --> 20:54.809
Don't.

20:57.008 --> 21:00.074
I had a lot of time to
think, laid up in that bed.

21:00.662 --> 21:04.550
And now I... I see all this.

21:06.424 --> 21:08.439
I wanna start all over with you.

21:11.591 --> 21:13.995
Do you think we could do that?

21:15.045 --> 21:16.591
I think that'd be nice.

21:20.388 --> 21:21.952
Look at this.

21:26.264 --> 21:28.278
Look at Tandy in that one.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.210
I'm so happy you wanted to see me.

21:36.781 --> 21:37.813
You okay?

21:37.970 --> 21:40.516
You know, I thought we were,
uh, building something together.

21:41.455 --> 21:42.581
We are.

21:45.196 --> 21:47.686
Then why did you tell the
tabloids about my divorce?

21:50.016 --> 21:52.303
You gonna deny it? I didn't mean to.

21:52.847 --> 21:55.481
A reporter tricked me
into confirming the story.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.109
I felt awful about it, and so I...

21:57.112 --> 21:59.352
I didn't say anything about it.

22:01.135 --> 22:02.586
Well, how do you think
he got the story, then?

22:02.617 --> 22:03.850
I don't know.

22:04.951 --> 22:07.178
I don't know. He...

22:07.485 --> 22:09.055
You gotta believe me.

22:09.175 --> 22:10.838
It felt wrong to hide it from you,

22:10.882 --> 22:12.139
and then Lamar shows up and...

22:12.146 --> 22:14.667
Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean, Lamar?

22:15.530 --> 22:17.870
Isn't he the one who told you?

22:18.415 --> 22:20.048
No.

22:20.168 --> 22:23.138
What did he do?

22:26.109 --> 22:27.686
Lamar told me that if I...

22:27.736 --> 22:29.801
didn't talk you into
picking his stadium site,

22:29.845 --> 22:33.899
that he would... he'd
tell you what I'd done.

22:33.949 --> 22:36.213
And you weren't gonna tell me
about that either?

22:36.251 --> 22:37.497
I didn't wanna hurt you.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.899
Yeah, well, you did, and
you hurt my children, too.

22:40.019 --> 22:41.932
Please.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.109
I love you.

22:45.291 --> 22:46.593
And you love me.

22:46.943 --> 22:49.127
Yeah, well, it's not enough.

22:50.447 --> 22:51.692
Please leave.

22:51.893 --> 22:53.432
Please.

22:54.195 --> 22:55.490
Leave.

22:55.860 --> 22:57.105
Now.

23:11.343 --> 23:12.445
Mornin'.

23:12.470 --> 23:14.741
Hi. I missed you in bed last night.

23:14.948 --> 23:16.987
Oh. Man, I got in so late.

23:17.016 --> 23:18.583
I didn't want to wake you up.

23:19.026 --> 23:21.754
So how'd the meeting with Rayna go?

23:23.337 --> 23:26.615
Well, actually, I spoke to her, and...

23:27.116 --> 23:29.024
she wants to give you another shot.

23:29.144 --> 23:30.262
And I...

23:32.758 --> 23:34.850
I didn't ask you to do that.

23:35.930 --> 23:37.475
You didn't have to ask me to do that.

23:37.482 --> 23:39.447
I love you, and I thought
it would be something

23:39.567 --> 23:41.593
that you'd be excited about.

23:41.975 --> 23:43.138
But, um...

23:43.457 --> 23:45.547
I-I went and talked to
Rayna, and she said yes,

23:45.593 --> 23:47.049
and I thought that was what we both wanted.

23:47.068 --> 23:48.895
So do you wanna tell me what's going on?

23:48.914 --> 23:51.291
Look, there was a time you'd
have asked me to do that,

23:51.304 --> 23:54.131
and I'd have done it in a second
just to be onstage with you.

23:54.888 --> 23:56.427
You know who you are as an artist,

23:56.440 --> 23:57.771
you... your music,

23:57.822 --> 23:59.750
the way you are onstage... you just know.

23:59.788 --> 24:02.609
Me? I'm just figuring that out. But...

24:03.035 --> 24:05.318
last night, I got up
onstage at Tootsies, right?

24:05.438 --> 24:08.033
And I get up and I play,
and, hell, I loved it.

24:08.153 --> 24:10.129
It just felt raw and... and real.

24:10.936 --> 24:13.445
I've got some music I wanna be playing.

24:14.690 --> 24:16.239
And that's...

24:16.830 --> 24:18.795
not something we can be
doing together right now.

24:21.142 --> 24:22.775
I just want you to be happy.

24:23.438 --> 24:25.299
I am happy.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.518
Of course I am.

24:28.838 --> 24:30.253
Come here.

24:38.642 --> 24:40.218
I think it looks good on you.

24:40.287 --> 24:41.224
You do?  Yeah.

24:41.225 --> 24:42.370
Deacon!

24:42.490 --> 24:43.834
Hey, man. Good to see ya. Hey!

24:43.884 --> 24:46.430
Yeah, wow. I thought you got fired.

24:46.550 --> 24:49.085
Yeah, but we made up in Atlanta.

24:49.108 --> 24:49.659
That's right. Yeah.

24:49.671 --> 24:50.634
How... how about you?

24:50.635 --> 24:53.124
You still enjoying bubblegum
glitter time with, uh, Juliette?

24:53.193 --> 24:54.213
Oh, every night's a joy.

24:54.276 --> 24:55.965
This is my girlfriend Stacey.

24:56.085 --> 24:56.997
Hi. Hi.

24:57.060 --> 24:59.425
- This is, uh, Liam...
- Liam McGuinnis. Yeah, I know who he is.

24:59.469 --> 25:01.429
What? I just said I don't
listen to country music.

25:01.432 --> 25:03.703
Oh, I'm, uh, I'm sure
he doesn't deserve you.

25:03.823 --> 25:04.955
It's a pleasure.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.638
Nice. Thank you.

25:06.758 --> 25:07.639
Hi. Hey.

25:07.759 --> 25:09.205
Hey. Oh, hi. It's nice to see you.

25:09.222 --> 25:10.035
Hi. Hi.

25:10.054 --> 25:12.419
Nice to see you, too. How are ya? Good.

25:12.607 --> 25:13.983
Wanna go see the stage? Yeah.

25:13.996 --> 25:15.172
Okay, great. Let's go. Bye.

25:15.203 --> 25:16.637
Bye. To the stage.
See y'all in a little bit.

25:16.649 --> 25:17.982
Bye. Nice to meet you. Bye.

25:20.436 --> 25:21.128
Hi.

25:21.178 --> 25:23.572
So? What about St. Lucia?

25:23.606 --> 25:26.024
Well, I get my girls back on Tuesday.

25:26.059 --> 25:28.618
Okay. But I figure if we leave tomorrow,

25:28.643 --> 25:31.478
we could have a nice,
long weekend in St. Lucia.

25:32.649 --> 25:34.116
No, no, no.

25:34.150 --> 25:36.038
This is my
place of work.  Okay.

25:36.044 --> 25:37.108
Gotta be professional.

25:37.139 --> 25:38.570
Until tomorrow.

25:41.658 --> 25:42.758
Hey, Juliette?

25:43.489 --> 25:45.923
Hi. I'm Esme.

25:48.601 --> 25:52.149
So, um, d-do you have any
questions about the house

25:52.174 --> 25:54.219
or financing or...

25:54.339 --> 25:57.460
Uh, actually, I had some questions

25:57.473 --> 26:00.270
about your relationship with my boyfriend.

26:01.990 --> 26:03.517
Well, he, um,

26:03.779 --> 26:05.756
he basically saved my life.

26:05.876 --> 26:06.670
Really?

26:06.845 --> 26:09.147
I was at the end of the line, and he...

26:09.642 --> 26:12.020
- He pulled me back.
- Oh...

26:13.465 --> 26:14.640
'Kay.

26:16.656 --> 26:18.139
Oh, wait. Are you...

26:18.259 --> 26:20.754
Are you asking
if he and I were involved?

26:20.954 --> 26:22.900
No. No, no. God, no.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.177
He... he just helped me
out for a little while,

26:25.183 --> 26:26.678
while I was at Riverside. That's it.

26:26.741 --> 26:28.912
We're just friends, really.

26:28.981 --> 26:30.451
He's totally not my type.

26:30.501 --> 26:32.534
Not... dorky enough for me.

26:32.596 --> 26:33.559
Yeah.

26:33.560 --> 26:34.536
Hey.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.169
What are you doing here?

26:36.857 --> 26:37.520
Oh, hey.

26:37.552 --> 26:40.761
I, um, I got an invitation
from your girlfriend.

26:41.193 --> 26:43.757
Well, if you had questions about
the house, I can handle that.

26:43.826 --> 26:45.966
I think I got the answers
that I was looking for.

26:46.210 --> 26:47.692
And you know what?

26:47.886 --> 26:49.131
I will take the house.

26:49.832 --> 26:51.833
Hell, furniture and all.

26:52.728 --> 26:54.391
I'll have the check sent right over.

26:54.705 --> 26:57.207
I'll... get ya the keys.

27:01.675 --> 27:03.451
15 minute warning.

27:03.714 --> 27:05.573
15 minutes till places, please.

27:08.006 --> 27:09.301
Avery.

27:09.858 --> 27:11.873
What are you doing here?

27:12.277 --> 27:13.627
Uh...

27:13.661 --> 27:14.711
workin'.

27:15.701 --> 27:16.865
Needed a job.

27:16.898 --> 27:18.629
Got this one.

27:20.436 --> 27:22.088
Heard about all your success.

27:22.545 --> 27:24.415
I'm really happy for you.

27:24.766 --> 27:26.380
Thank you.  Barkley!

27:27.050 --> 27:28.639
Get back to work!

27:32.096 --> 27:33.669
Enjoy the show.

27:37.236 --> 27:38.476
What's going on here?

27:38.550 --> 27:41.459
I canceled all of Lamar
Wyatt's city contracts.

27:41.649 --> 27:42.911
Everything?

27:43.117 --> 27:44.800
Yeah. Every last one of them.

27:44.835 --> 27:46.182
He is not gonna get a single dime

27:46.207 --> 27:47.928
off of that stadium or
any other Metro money.

27:47.959 --> 27:49.911
Wait. Some of those contracts
were set up as a favor to me.

27:49.940 --> 27:52.332
I know. I am aware of that. They're
servicing underprivileged areas.

27:52.370 --> 27:53.590
They're... they're reduced rates.

27:53.602 --> 27:55.654
And we can always negotiate those deals

27:55.673 --> 27:56.699
with whoever takes over.

27:56.756 --> 27:58.358
You're being impulsive here.

27:58.401 --> 28:00.403
Cole, we're gonna figure it out, okay?

28:00.523 --> 28:01.935
Now if you'll excuse me.

28:07.636 --> 28:09.932
You know, she can't just
summon me and hold me here

28:09.976 --> 28:11.052
like I'm a prisoner.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.693
She just wants you to meet someone.

28:13.411 --> 28:14.500
Hey, mama.

28:15.138 --> 28:17.215
That's the woman that I
saw him kissing downtown.

28:17.239 --> 28:18.453
That's the woman I was telling you about.

28:18.466 --> 28:19.923
Mama, I know who she is, okay?

28:19.930 --> 28:21.125
And I'm not concerned about her.

28:21.143 --> 28:23.357
It's you I'm worried about. Me?

28:23.807 --> 28:25.784
Yeah. Why are
you concerned with me?

28:25.841 --> 28:27.980
I think you should go now. Yeah.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.095
I saw him kissing her downtown.

28:30.527 --> 28:33.349
Jolene, have you been using?

28:33.605 --> 28:35.920
I mean, what... no. Excuse me?

28:36.158 --> 28:37.089
Lies and manipulation.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.811
I feel like you're on the edge
here. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

28:38.836 --> 28:40.168
I don't need an intervention here.

28:40.187 --> 28:42.940
I'm not the one who's using anyone here.

28:42.978 --> 28:43.810
- I'm not...
- Mom. Mom.

28:43.829 --> 28:45.124
Get out of my stuff! This is how you act

28:45.161 --> 28:46.400
right before you're about
to fall off the wagon.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.827
Get out of my stuff! Or
when you already have.

28:50.704 --> 28:52.205
Those are not mine.  Really?

28:52.236 --> 28:54.507
I don't know where they came from,
but they are not mine. Really?

28:54.520 --> 28:56.147
After all that we've been through?

28:56.153 --> 28:57.986
After all we've been through?
I haven't done anything, honey!

28:58.018 --> 28:59.213
Those are not mine!

28:59.231 --> 29:01.346
Are you kidding me? I-I-I think
we gotta get her back to Riverside.

29:01.383 --> 29:03.454
Why do you think I'm lying to you?
Jolene, you have to go back to Riverside.

29:03.574 --> 29:05.206
Stop lying. They're not mine!

29:05.243 --> 29:07.590
This is... this... you have to do this, okay?
For once in your life, stop lying!

29:10.793 --> 29:13.045
Thank you, Nashville!

29:13.165 --> 29:15.960
I would like to just
give a big ol' shout out

29:15.961 --> 29:19.270
to my producer and my lead guitar player,

29:19.332 --> 29:20.796
Mr. Liam McGuinnis.

29:22.774 --> 29:25.044
"Postcards from Mexico"!

29:25.164 --> 29:28.304
That's an old one. Liam doesn't
know many of the old ones.

29:32.276 --> 29:33.540
I know the cool ones!

29:33.571 --> 29:34.854
I guess he does.

29:34.879 --> 29:36.481
Nashville loves you!

29:38.953 --> 29:41.586
Is this one of the
songs you wrote together?

29:41.649 --> 29:42.819
Yeah.

Daddy? It's late.

30:55.927 --> 30:57.980
You're supposed to be recovering,

30:58.014 --> 30:59.275
not working.

30:59.482 --> 31:00.883
I spoke with Albert.

31:00.917 --> 31:03.674
Teddy's canceled all our Metro contracts,

31:04.154 --> 31:07.940
because you told him I had
Peggy Kenter on the line.

31:07.991 --> 31:11.100
Teddy's been a part of
our family for 13 years.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.472
I was showing him a little respect.

31:13.503 --> 31:15.424
This is my company. It's not yours.

31:15.899 --> 31:18.483
After everything
that's happened, I can't believe

31:19.146 --> 31:21.073
that it was Rayna who was there for me.

31:21.417 --> 31:22.354
What?

31:22.674 --> 31:24.395
She's the one

31:25.677 --> 31:28.380
who was holding my hand
when I woke up from surgery.

31:28.405 --> 31:29.838
And she's the one...

31:31.058 --> 31:33.829
who's not
acting like I've lost my edge.

31:37.864 --> 31:40.367
Good night.

31:47.624 --> 31:48.913
Um...

31:49.345 --> 31:50.533
Hey.

31:51.867 --> 31:53.167
What was that all about?

31:53.185 --> 31:54.352
What?

31:54.386 --> 31:56.058
You never came back.

31:57.340 --> 31:59.574
Not gonna watch her whole
damn show.

32:01.808 --> 32:03.515
You know when, um...

32:03.878 --> 32:05.947
when you came to see me last week,

32:05.981 --> 32:08.827
were you actually here to
see Rayna and her father

32:08.859 --> 32:10.104
in the hospital?

32:10.329 --> 32:12.770
I mean, I read the paper. I
know he had a heart attack.

32:14.746 --> 32:16.073
I was there to see you.

32:16.091 --> 32:19.093
I just stopped by to
see her on my way home.

32:19.940 --> 32:21.604
I'm sorry. I should've told you that.

32:26.647 --> 32:28.574
Do you still have feelings for her?

32:30.555 --> 32:31.495
Yeah.

32:34.892 --> 32:37.076
I told you we got this long
history, and I'm just...

32:38.296 --> 32:39.602
I don't know if it's out of my blood.

32:39.603 --> 32:41.424
I'm just... I'm trying,
though. I'm trying.

32:41.443 --> 32:43.570
Yeah, well, I don't really
know what to do with that.

32:43.690 --> 32:46.599
I mean, is it... are you
just wishing that she were here

32:46.630 --> 32:47.681
instead of me?

32:47.801 --> 32:48.964
It's not that. I'm here.

32:48.976 --> 32:51.466
I'm here. I'm with you.
That's where I wanna be.

32:51.492 --> 32:53.381
And I'm just trying to be
honest about it. I'm just...

32:53.431 --> 32:56.459
Oh, yeah. That's good.
Now you're gonna be honest.

32:57.804 --> 32:58.955
I'm just trying to make it work.

32:58.961 --> 33:00.050
Isn't that enough for right now?

33:00.063 --> 33:01.877
I don't know. I don't
really know.

33:01.908 --> 33:02.991
Hey.

33:03.335 --> 33:04.111
Hey. Hey. Hey.

33:04.142 --> 33:04.880
Hey, come on.

33:04.905 --> 33:06.075
Um... hey.

33:06.119 --> 33:07.327
Can you...
Hey, come on.

33:07.364 --> 33:09.041
No, can you just, like...
uh, can you just stop?

33:09.104 --> 33:10.912
I just need a little...

33:11.245 --> 33:12.908
time. Okay?

33:16.917 --> 33:18.876
Just... great.

33:21.022 --> 33:22.273
Hey.

33:25.314 --> 33:26.926
Everything okay?

33:27.385 --> 33:29.062
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

33:31.231 --> 33:33.115
No. No.

33:34.635 --> 33:35.885
Come here.

33:43.727 --> 33:45.034
What's the matter?

33:46.073 --> 33:47.196
You.

33:50.972 --> 33:53.599
I been trying forever to fight
this thing between you and me,

33:53.606 --> 33:54.771
and, uh...

33:55.295 --> 33:58.024
just when I think I get there...

34:03.213 --> 34:04.480
You ready?

34:08.333 --> 34:10.667
We're going to St. Lucia together, so...

34:11.911 --> 34:14.308
you need to call Stacey and make it right.

34:14.527 --> 34:15.716
Mm-hmm.

34:21.527 --> 34:22.498
See you.

34:28.704 --> 34:31.826
So... what are we doing here?

34:33.889 --> 34:36.161
Daddy's recovering from his heart attacks,

34:36.850 --> 34:39.864
but there are some changes
coming to the company.

34:39.985 --> 34:41.405
Oh. So you, uh...

34:41.842 --> 34:43.638
came to tell me he's retiring, huh?

34:43.656 --> 34:45.184
No, of course not.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.400
But I think that we both know

34:48.406 --> 34:50.344
it's time for him to
take a step or two back.

34:52.697 --> 34:54.215
And for you to take a...

34:54.250 --> 34:56.501
a step forward, huh?

34:56.833 --> 34:59.717
I would like to propose a new alliance...

35:00.462 --> 35:03.208
one that's truly for the
betterment of Nashville.

35:03.242 --> 35:06.525
The two us. Like old times.

35:07.995 --> 35:13.038
Now we both know that Teddy is
the wrong person for this city.

35:13.069 --> 35:15.708
- Oh. Tandy...
- And I think...

35:16.803 --> 35:19.062
that if
you were to take a look

35:19.080 --> 35:20.676
into his past...

35:22.378 --> 35:23.742
you would think so, too.

35:24.048 --> 35:25.568
And it might just help you,

35:25.688 --> 35:27.839
if you ever need a little ammunition.

35:28.177 --> 35:30.373
And what in particular
should I be looking at?

35:30.786 --> 35:32.500
Maybe the Cumberland deal.

35:38.695 --> 35:41.385
Bo got your mom back to her place.

35:41.979 --> 35:44.839
The counselor's gonna stay
with her till tomorrow.

35:45.325 --> 35:47.704
I really thought she was gonna
make it through this time.

35:48.311 --> 35:49.687
I'm so sorry.

35:50.246 --> 35:51.621
I don't know.

35:55.950 --> 35:57.783
Hmm. What's the matter?

35:57.834 --> 36:00.242
This is hydromorphone.

36:00.643 --> 36:02.063
This...

36:02.676 --> 36:04.822
- This can't be hers.
- How do you know?

36:04.866 --> 36:07.249
Because she would stop
breathing if she took it.

36:08.463 --> 36:09.733
She's allergic.

36:09.933 --> 36:11.979
I learned the hard way when I was 10.

36:12.752 --> 36:13.900
Where's Dante?

36:14.020 --> 36:15.601
Uh...

36:16.089 --> 36:17.239
Where is he?

36:17.273 --> 36:18.941
Call him.

36:20.950 --> 36:23.329
Sam? Have you seen Dante?

36:23.363 --> 36:24.441
He picked up the walk-around money

36:24.460 --> 36:26.701
about a half an hour ago,
said he was gonna pay the crew.

36:26.838 --> 36:28.884
His phone is going straight to voice mail.

36:29.497 --> 36:31.230
Call him again.

36:49.506 --> 36:51.283
Are you miserable?

36:51.658 --> 36:52.984
No.

36:53.310 --> 36:55.681
This is a-a great opportunity.

36:55.693 --> 36:56.716
I'm just...

36:56.751 --> 36:58.435
making the best of it.

36:58.465 --> 37:00.680
It's kinda nice to see
this version of you again.

37:02.206 --> 37:03.295
Which version is that?

37:03.415 --> 37:05.008
The boy I met at school.

37:05.979 --> 37:07.310
I liked him.

37:12.329 --> 37:13.987
I'm trying to get back to him.

37:17.428 --> 37:18.992
What are you still doing here, anyway?

37:19.837 --> 37:21.882
Wasn't quite ready to leave yet.

37:23.134 --> 37:25.755
It's not every day I get
to be backstage at an arena.

37:30.473 --> 37:31.887
You wanna be onstage?

37:44.230 --> 37:45.426
Kinda cool, right?

37:45.958 --> 37:46.665
Yep.

37:54.997 --> 37:56.936
Hey. Hey.

37:57.756 --> 37:59.114
Are you by yourself?

37:59.865 --> 38:01.444
What's going on, Ray?

38:01.479 --> 38:03.096
I was at home,

38:03.130 --> 38:05.014
packing for St. Lucia,

38:05.134 --> 38:06.666
and it just didn't feel right.

38:07.554 --> 38:10.136
And I know you're trying
to move on with your life.

38:12.541 --> 38:14.681
And I'm trying to move on with my life.

38:17.027 --> 38:18.303
But...

38:22.439 --> 38:23.703
I love you.

38:24.278 --> 38:26.230
That's just never not been true.

38:26.706 --> 38:28.981
Are you trying to kill
me? What are you doing?

38:28.982 --> 38:30.622
Are you... two hours ago,

38:31.423 --> 38:32.837
you were getting on an airplane with Liam.

38:32.862 --> 38:34.601
You told me to get back
with Stacey. Yeah, I know.

38:34.639 --> 38:36.046
Now you are standing right
here on my porch... yeah.

38:36.059 --> 38:37.660
And you're telling me this now?

38:37.780 --> 38:40.382
I love you. That is the truth.

38:40.720 --> 38:42.509
And you can do with that what you will.

38:42.828 --> 38:44.431
But I needed to let you know,

38:44.551 --> 38:46.339
and so I did.

38:50.254 --> 38:51.404
Hey.

39:03.034 --> 39:05.747
Apart from tonight's walking around money,

39:06.004 --> 39:10.123
there's another $475,000 missing
from your corporate account.

39:11.110 --> 39:12.947
I think we should call the police.

39:13.067 --> 39:13.687
No.

39:15.292 --> 39:17.591
No, I don't want anybody
to know about this.

39:17.711 --> 39:19.349
Will you call my mom

39:19.932 --> 39:20.850
and just let her know

39:20.970 --> 39:22.960
that she doesn't have to go back to rehab?

39:25.112 --> 39:27.323
I don't... think I can do it.

39:28.522 --> 39:30.168
What about this place?

39:30.437 --> 39:31.463
What do you want to do?

39:32.602 --> 39:34.046
I'm buying it.

39:35.135 --> 39:36.643
Y-you don't have to.

39:36.674 --> 39:37.925
I'm sure you can get out of it.

39:38.240 --> 39:40.624
No, it'll be a good reminder

39:41.043 --> 39:43.127
to never trust anybody.

39:49.403 --> 39:52.249
What about that song
you played at Tootsies?

39:52.671 --> 39:54.382
I never heard those lyrics before.

39:54.601 --> 39:57.192
Mm.

39:57.536 --> 39:59.594
My brother wrote 'em.

40:01.208 --> 40:03.281
Found 'em in his journal, man.

40:05.188 --> 40:07.068
He was the talent in the family.

40:07.102 --> 40:12.054
And yet you told Jack
Nelson that song was yours.

40:13.609 --> 40:15.911
Yeah. I did.

40:16.345 --> 40:17.982
I don't know, man.

40:18.670 --> 40:20.303
Ahh.

40:20.883 --> 40:22.150
You know, I guess I...

40:22.324 --> 40:24.719
I...  I wanted to do it as a...

40:24.753 --> 40:26.829
as a tribute?

40:27.273 --> 40:30.565
And I just didn't know how to explain
that to Jack...

40:30.685 --> 40:32.836
without gettin' dark.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.864
Don't sweat it, man.

40:37.659 --> 40:39.874
Scarlett pissed you
decided to stay in with me

40:39.880 --> 40:41.275
instead of go out with her?

40:43.446 --> 40:45.530
Probably. 'Cause we're being so productive.

40:49.624 --> 40:50.991
Oh.

40:51.010 --> 40:54.107
Well, you know, man?

40:54.227 --> 40:57.498
Things have been gettin' pretty weird.

40:57.867 --> 40:59.368
And I don't...

40:59.488 --> 41:02.115
I-I don't know how to fix it.

41:02.784 --> 41:04.780
I keep thinking maybe...

41:05.562 --> 41:07.589
I just been kidding myself

41:07.658 --> 41:09.140
thinking it was gonna last forever.

41:10.636 --> 41:13.889
Does that sound... stupid to you?

41:14.415 --> 41:15.973
No.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.674
Good.

41:21.090 --> 41:23.036
What the hell are you doing?

41:23.156 --> 41:24.950
I just...

41:25.144 --> 41:27.059
You need to... to get out, man.

41:27.077 --> 41:28.910
Oh. I-I-I
didn't mean it.

41:28.948 --> 41:30.337
Please, just get out. I-I didn't...

41:30.338 --> 41:31.551
Whoa.

41:31.671 --> 41:32.958
Just go. Just get out.

41:32.971 --> 41:34.741
I'm sorry. Just go.

41:35.053 --> 41:36.437
