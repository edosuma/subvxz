00:02.370 --> 00:03.971
- * Hey, here comes Sunny
keeping it fun *

00:04.072 --> 00:05.439
* Never says never,
never gives up *

00:05.539 --> 00:08.342
* It's Sunny,
yeah, she's Sunny *

00:08.442 --> 00:09.877
* Hey

00:09.977 --> 00:11.512
* Gear up and go
in the Glam Van *

00:11.612 --> 00:13.314
* Hair styling
with her best friends *

00:13.414 --> 00:15.816
* It's Sunny,
yeah, she's Sunny *

00:15.916 --> 00:18.686
* Oh, it's a Sunny Day

00:18.786 --> 00:21.389
* She'll put a smile
on your face *

00:21.489 --> 00:22.990
- Whoo-hoo!

00:23.091 --> 00:27.561
- * Sunny is shining
all the way *

00:27.661 --> 00:30.831
* Yeah, she's Sunny,
yeah, she's Sunny *

00:30.931 --> 00:33.367
* Having a sunny, sunny day

00:33.467 --> 00:34.468
- Hoo-hoo!

00:38.272 --> 00:41.008
- "The Forever Home."

00:41.109 --> 00:42.710
- [giggles]

00:42.810 --> 00:44.078
- Hey, watch out!

00:44.178 --> 00:45.946
- Oops.
Sorry, Blair.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.482
I was just helping Scratch
put up this ba--

00:48.582 --> 00:49.917
a....

00:50.017 --> 00:51.018
Achoo!

00:51.119 --> 00:53.087
- Oh, whoa!

00:53.187 --> 00:54.788
- Oh, I've got this.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.290
- Whoa!

00:56.390 --> 00:57.891
[sighs]
- Here you go.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.093
Gesundheit.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.395
- Thanks.
That keeps happening.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.697
I just can't seem
to stop sneezing today.

01:03.797 --> 01:04.865
Achoo!

01:04.965 --> 01:06.600
Ah!
Whoa!

01:06.700 --> 01:07.735
Oof!

01:07.835 --> 01:09.537
- [gasps]
My vegetable patch!

01:09.637 --> 01:11.572
- Oh. [laughs]
Oh!

01:11.672 --> 01:14.608
- Oh, not the carrots!

01:14.708 --> 01:16.110
- Sorry, Scratch.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.511
- Here you go, Timmy.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.680
- Oh, thanks, Blair.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.081
- What's the banner for?

01:21.182 --> 01:22.250
- To let everyone know

01:22.350 --> 01:24.318
about the pound's adoption day.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.187
- So all the pups in the pound

01:26.287 --> 01:27.821
can find a forever home.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.089
Achoo!

01:29.190 --> 01:31.225
- That's a great idea!

01:31.325 --> 01:33.861
But you sound like
you have a bad cold, Timmy.

01:33.961 --> 01:35.563
Maybe you should get some rest.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.565
- Oh, no.
I'm fine!

01:37.665 --> 01:38.932
Achoo!

01:39.032 --> 01:40.801
I can't let the dogs down.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.771
[sneezes repeatedly]

01:43.871 --> 01:45.139
- Nuh-uh-uh.

01:45.239 --> 01:47.175
You need to get better.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.376
I'll help Scratch.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.678
- What do you know
about dogs?

01:50.778 --> 01:52.280
- Only that I love them!

01:52.380 --> 01:53.714
I'll go get Sunny and Rox.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.749
I'm sure they'd love to help.

01:55.849 --> 01:56.984
- Well, it looks like

01:57.084 --> 01:58.386
you won't be
needing me anymore.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.788
I'm gonna head back to the--
[sneezes]

02:00.888 --> 02:02.190
apple orchard.

02:02.290 --> 02:05.293
I sure hope adoption day goes--
[sneezes]

02:05.393 --> 02:09.230
Well.
[sneezes violently]

02:09.330 --> 02:11.999
- Ah!
Not again.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.967
- [sneezes]
Oh!

02:14.067 --> 02:16.837
[sneezing]

02:16.937 --> 02:18.239
- Okay, doggies.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.141
Today's the day
we find your forever home.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.676
[dogs exclaim]

02:22.776 --> 02:24.144
[upbeat music]

02:24.245 --> 02:25.846
- And so Timmy needed to rest

02:25.946 --> 02:27.348
and Scratch really needs
our help--

02:27.448 --> 02:29.149
well, the dogs
really need our help.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.851
Scratch wasn't so sure.
[gasps]

02:30.951 --> 02:32.420
Did I mention the dogs?

02:32.520 --> 02:35.556
- [laughs]
Once or twice, Blair.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.891
- Sunny?

02:37.991 --> 02:38.992
- [gasps]
Oops.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.028
Sorry about that.

02:41.128 --> 02:44.398
- Now that I can see it,
I love it!

02:44.498 --> 02:46.934
- Thanks.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.736
- And have a sunny day.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.771
- Speaking of sunny days,

02:50.871 --> 02:52.673
we could make every day sunny

02:52.773 --> 02:53.741
for those poor puppies

02:53.841 --> 02:55.142
if we found them homes.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.944
- Okay.
Good idea.

02:57.044 --> 02:59.179
- I mean, Doodle found you.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.615
- I sure did.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.050
- And Violet has Rox.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.318
[both giggle]

03:04.418 --> 03:06.320
- [laughs]
I said okay, Blair.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.390
- Imagine how amazing it'd be
if w--wait, what?

03:09.490 --> 03:11.058
- Let's do it!
- Really?

03:11.158 --> 03:12.693
Oh, yay!

03:12.793 --> 03:13.827
Okay, then we'd better go.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.596
Scratch is waiting.
Ready?

03:15.696 --> 03:16.964
- Ready.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.299
Set.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.601
all: Gear up and go!

03:20.701 --> 03:23.604
[upbeat music]

03:23.704 --> 03:30.778
*

03:36.584 --> 03:37.951
- Come on.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.087
Uh--whoa!

03:40.187 --> 03:42.623
- Hi, Scratch.
Are you okay?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.091
- Um, yes?

03:44.191 --> 03:45.359
[strains, grunts]
- Salon squad

03:45.459 --> 03:46.660
reporting for duty.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.263
Let's find forever homes
for those pups.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.399
- Thanks, but you know,

03:51.499 --> 03:54.134
finding forever homes
is tricky business.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.505
You need to find
the right owners for each dog,

03:57.605 --> 04:01.275
and to do that,
you've got to get to know them.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.511
- Yes, yes!
Let's meet the doggies!

04:03.611 --> 04:05.212
- Well, then...
[blows whistle]

04:05.313 --> 04:07.415
Allow me to introduce...

04:07.515 --> 04:10.451
[anticipatory music]

04:10.551 --> 04:13.621
- Bertie.
Pleased to meet you.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.289
- Ah, he's so cute!

04:15.389 --> 04:18.058
- Bertie's the best
tracking dog there is.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.594
- If I can sniff it...
[sniffs]

04:20.694 --> 04:22.162
I can find it.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.898
- Here, Bertie.
Give this a sniff.

04:24.998 --> 04:28.268
Now go find it.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.571
Yep, Bertie's got
a lot of talent,

04:30.671 --> 04:33.206
though he wasn't built
for speed.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.042
Oop!
Whoa!

04:35.142 --> 04:38.011
[plodding music]

04:38.111 --> 04:39.347
*

04:39.447 --> 04:42.182
- Slow and steady
wins the race.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.084
- You go, Bertie!

04:44.184 --> 04:46.687
- Ah, yes.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.821
Well...

04:47.921 --> 04:49.723
And this is Queenie.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.392
[fanfare]

04:51.492 --> 04:53.226
I don't think
she's a real queen,

04:53.327 --> 04:55.529
but she won't answer
to anything else.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.965
- Pleased to meet you,
Your Highness.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.667
- Charmed.

04:59.767 --> 05:03.103
- [yips]

05:03.203 --> 05:04.372
- And who's that?

05:04.472 --> 05:06.306
- That's Rosie.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.275
She doesn't say much.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.210
- [whimpers]

05:10.310 --> 05:13.246
- Aww.
She's just a little shy.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.482
- [whimpers]

05:14.582 --> 05:17.017
- [laughs]
Not just a little shy.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.452
She's a lot shy.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.320
She hides
whenever we have visitors

05:20.421 --> 05:22.255
at the pound.

05:22.356 --> 05:23.824
- [whimpers]

05:23.924 --> 05:28.028
- Oh, Rosie's been here
longer than any of us.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.664
- Poor Rosie.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.300
We need to help her
find a forever home.

05:33.401 --> 05:37.671
- [whines]

05:37.771 --> 05:39.139
- Don't you worry.

05:39.239 --> 05:40.908
We're going to make sure
all the dogs

05:41.008 --> 05:42.275
find their forever homes,

05:42.376 --> 05:44.144
and that includes Rosie.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.779
[sprightly music]

05:45.879 --> 05:47.415
- Oh, I hope so, Sunny.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.249
I'll try talking to her.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.751
- Great idea, Blair.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.420
Okay, so what's first?

05:52.520 --> 05:53.987
We're here, we're ready,
we're--

05:54.087 --> 05:56.223
- Eating my carrots!

05:56.323 --> 05:58.959
- [strains]

05:59.059 --> 06:01.529
- Sorry.
Violet loves carrots.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.296
- No one's here to eat.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.265
We have work to do.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.600
How about we make these dogs

06:06.700 --> 06:09.169
look their best
for their new owners?

06:09.269 --> 06:10.971
- That, we can do.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.974
[upbeat music]

06:14.074 --> 06:21.348
*

06:22.115 --> 06:23.784
- Step into our salon.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.786
- [gasps]
- Oh!

06:25.886 --> 06:27.120
- Great.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.056
You guys get in there
and get styled,

06:29.156 --> 06:32.826
and I will wait out here
and... wait.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.762
- Rosie?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.263
- [whimpering]

06:36.363 --> 06:38.065
- [gasps]
There you are!

06:38.165 --> 06:39.132
- [whimpers]

06:39.232 --> 06:40.634
- Don't be scared.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.269
[gasps]
I've got a doggie biscuit

06:42.369 --> 06:43.871
for you.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.873
Mm.
Tasty.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.274
- [whimpers]

06:47.374 --> 06:49.342
- Don't like doggie biscuits,
huh?

06:49.443 --> 06:52.012
Well, I don't have
any other treats.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.347
Well, apart from this apple.

06:54.448 --> 06:57.885
- [pants]

06:57.985 --> 06:59.352
- [gasps]
[laughs]

06:59.453 --> 07:01.989
I guess we found
your favorite treat.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.090
Apples!

07:03.190 --> 07:04.925
They're my favorite, too.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.194
Wanna know something else
we have in common?

07:07.294 --> 07:09.029
I'm shy, too,

07:09.129 --> 07:11.231
and sometimes,
new things scare me,

07:11.331 --> 07:14.101
but I'd like
to be your friend,

07:14.201 --> 07:15.636
if you'd let me.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.870
- [chirps]

07:16.970 --> 07:18.706
- And walk, walk, walk,

07:18.806 --> 07:20.641
and stop.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.477
- [chirps]

07:23.577 --> 07:26.680
[upbeat music]

07:26.780 --> 07:28.649
*

07:28.749 --> 07:30.818
- Go, Rosie!

07:30.918 --> 07:32.352
- Whoa-oa-oa-oa!

07:32.452 --> 07:34.655
*

07:34.755 --> 07:35.656
[barks]

07:35.756 --> 07:37.558
*

07:37.658 --> 07:40.260
- Great job.
Say cheese!

07:40.360 --> 07:42.563
Or... apples!

07:42.663 --> 07:44.798
- [whines]
- Hm...

07:44.898 --> 07:47.868
You know, the world
might look a lot less scary

07:47.968 --> 07:50.738
if you could see it
from under all that hair.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.973
[gasps]
Maybe Sunny could do

07:53.073 --> 07:54.241
something about it.

07:54.341 --> 07:55.743
- [inquiring whine]

07:55.843 --> 07:58.145
*

07:58.245 --> 08:01.081
Okay, this is good.
What a good boy.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.616
*

08:02.716 --> 08:04.251
Mm.
A little over here...

08:04.351 --> 08:05.452
Perfect.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.954
All done, Bertie.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.556
- Pretty handsome,

08:08.656 --> 08:10.924
if I do say so myself.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.393
*

08:13.493 --> 08:15.796
- You're done too, Queenie.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.931
- Looking marvelous,
Your Highness.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.767
- [gasps]
I love it!

08:19.867 --> 08:20.834
Thank you.

08:20.934 --> 08:24.437
- Rosie needs some styling too,
Sunny.

08:24.538 --> 08:25.873
- Welcome, Rosie.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.140
Please have a seat.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.110
*

08:30.210 --> 08:32.112
- Sunny's the best.
You'll see.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.081
- Time to find
the real Rosie

08:34.181 --> 08:35.448
under all that hair.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.017
- [whimpers]

08:37.117 --> 08:39.186
- It's okay.
I'm right here.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.754
- It's okay, Rosie.

08:40.854 --> 08:45.926
Let me just brush this back
and... Wow!

08:46.026 --> 08:47.728
There you are!

08:47.828 --> 08:48.962
Hi, Rosie.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.130
Nice to meet you.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.765
- [chirps]

08:51.865 --> 08:54.868
- Now, a hair elastic, and...

08:54.968 --> 08:55.869
- Ta-da!

08:55.969 --> 08:57.738
Rosie's new topknot.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.172
- I love it!

08:59.272 --> 09:01.441
Do you like it, Rosie?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.476
- Mm.
[chirps]

09:03.577 --> 09:05.478
- [giggles]

09:05.579 --> 09:08.248
- [laughs]
I guess that's a yes.

09:08.348 --> 09:12.953
*

09:13.053 --> 09:15.122
- Hm...

09:15.222 --> 09:19.059
Looks like everyone's ready
for their forever homes.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.328
[laughter]
- All right.

09:21.428 --> 09:24.097
- But it says here
in my rulebook,

09:24.197 --> 09:26.466
page six, paragraph two,

09:26.566 --> 09:29.770
that in a forever home,
responsibility is key.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.039
- Well, I'm very responsible.

09:32.139 --> 09:35.843
I always wipe my paws,
and I don't chew the furniture,

09:35.943 --> 09:39.246
and I don't slurp
from my water bowl.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.314
- I think Scratch means

09:41.414 --> 09:44.084
your new owners
needs to be responsible.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.986
- Also says, owner and dog

09:46.086 --> 09:47.487
should be compatible.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.189
- What's compa--

09:49.289 --> 09:50.523
um, compa...

09:50.624 --> 09:51.859
- Compatible.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.361
It means how things work
or go together.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.664
- Aha!
Like Sunny and me!

09:56.764 --> 09:58.231
We're very compaba--

09:58.331 --> 09:59.499
Compababa--

09:59.599 --> 10:00.533
- Compatible.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.135
- Exactly.
- [laughs]

10:02.235 --> 10:03.536
- In that case,

10:03.637 --> 10:05.438
I'd be compatible with an owner

10:05.538 --> 10:07.775
who takes things nice and slow.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.577
- You'll make someone
a great new best friend.

10:10.678 --> 10:11.945
- And what about you, Queenie?

10:12.045 --> 10:13.647
Who would you
be compatible with?

10:13.747 --> 10:16.583
- How about someone
who lives in a big castle

10:16.684 --> 10:19.486
with lots of crowns
for me to wear,

10:19.586 --> 10:23.323
or someone who's just
really kind

10:23.423 --> 10:25.959
and likes playing
with my long hair?

10:26.059 --> 10:29.229
- Okay, time to find
forever homes.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.798
- Great.
So, uh,

10:30.898 --> 10:33.400
where are all these owners
with forever homes?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.335
- Oh, they could be anywhere,
Rox.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.404
[sighs]
Yep.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.740
Out there, somewhere,

10:39.840 --> 10:42.776
just waiting
for their forever dogs.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.012
- That means we have
to go out and find them,

10:45.112 --> 10:48.548
and I think I've got
the perfect way to do that.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.518
Rox, can you stay here
and help Scratch set up?

10:51.618 --> 10:53.353
- I'm on it!

10:53.453 --> 10:54.621
- [over speaker]
Hey, everyone.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.056
Something really special

10:56.156 --> 10:58.625
is going on in Friendly Falls
today.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.894
* If you're looking
for a companion *

11:00.994 --> 11:03.831
- * A furry friend
who loves to play *

11:03.931 --> 11:07.667
- * Who can put
a smile upon your face *

11:07.768 --> 11:09.737
both: * On a chilly day

11:09.837 --> 11:13.774
- * You're gonna see
how good your life can get *

11:13.874 --> 11:16.676
- * 'Cause you've got
another friend *

11:16.777 --> 11:19.446
both: * You just don't
know it yet *

11:19.546 --> 11:21.681
both: * Take me home

11:21.782 --> 11:24.617
- * Where I can hear
the sound of laughter *

11:24.718 --> 11:27.420
both: * Take me home

11:27.520 --> 11:30.758
- * To my warm and happy
ever after *

11:30.858 --> 11:33.293
both: * And I will never roam

11:33.393 --> 11:36.429
* If you just take me home

11:36.529 --> 11:38.732
* Home

11:38.832 --> 11:41.568
* Where family
is all around me *

11:41.668 --> 11:44.137
all: * Home

11:44.237 --> 11:47.307
* You're gonna be
so glad you found me *

11:47.407 --> 11:49.642
* And I will never roam

11:49.743 --> 11:54.114
* If you just take me home

11:54.214 --> 11:57.150
* Take me home

11:57.250 --> 12:03.056
* Take me home

12:04.191 --> 12:07.060
[upbeat music]

12:07.160 --> 12:10.063
- What is that?

12:10.163 --> 12:12.599
- This?
This is my rubber stamp.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.567
Every dog gets a certificate

12:14.667 --> 12:16.770
when they're adopted
into a forever home,

12:16.870 --> 12:21.408
but it's not official,
not until I stamp it.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.076
- So we've got a stamp,

12:23.176 --> 12:24.878
we've got dogs...

12:24.978 --> 12:29.082
- And now we've got
some possible owners, too.

12:29.182 --> 12:32.719
- This is going to be the best
dog adoption day ever.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.622
[upbeat banjo music]

12:35.722 --> 12:37.825
- Oh, aren't you so cute?

12:37.925 --> 12:39.960
- I want that one!

12:40.060 --> 12:42.695
- Ooh, look at that!
- This one!

12:42.796 --> 12:44.697
- We need a system,
and fast!

12:44.798 --> 12:46.533
- It's like Scratch said.

12:46.633 --> 12:47.968
We need to work out which dog

12:48.068 --> 12:49.702
would be right
for which owner.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.304
- Compatibility.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.572
- It's just hard
when they're all

12:52.672 --> 12:54.374
moving around so fast.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.210
- Whoa!
- I want this one!

12:57.310 --> 12:59.980
- But I already have a home.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.614
- All right.

13:01.714 --> 13:02.983
- [sighs]

13:03.083 --> 13:03.817
- [gasps]

13:03.917 --> 13:05.418
I think I've got an idea

13:05.518 --> 13:07.254
how to get things organized.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.789
[upbeat music]

13:09.890 --> 13:11.992
We'll showcase the dogs
one by one

13:12.092 --> 13:13.861
so people will get
to know them.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.562
- Great idea, Blair.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.865
Scratch can tell everyone
all about them

13:17.965 --> 13:21.034
while they walk the catwalk.
- Hey!

13:21.134 --> 13:25.138
[straining] Give me
that radish!

13:25.238 --> 13:26.406
Ah.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.841
- What can I say?

13:27.941 --> 13:30.177
She loves vegetables.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.379
- Aww.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.914
- Hi, everyone!

13:34.014 --> 13:36.816
Welcome to the pound's
dog adoption day.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.386
We've got some awesome dogs
for you to meet,

13:39.486 --> 13:41.889
so take it away, Scratch.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.925
- Um.
Let's see.

13:45.025 --> 13:48.661
[hesitantly] Caring for a dog
is a big responsibility.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.663
There's all the, um, walks,

13:50.763 --> 13:52.765
and also, there's dinnertimes,

13:52.866 --> 13:56.203
and... throwing sticks?
Um...

13:56.303 --> 13:58.538
- Maybe you could
tell everyone something

13:58.638 --> 13:59.873
about the dogs.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.942
- Oh, right.
Yes.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.244
This is Bertie.
He has ears,

14:04.344 --> 14:06.179
and a tail.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.647
- Hm?

14:07.747 --> 14:09.883
- Um...

14:09.983 --> 14:11.584
- I'll handle this, Scratch.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.422
It calls for a bit
of razzle-dazzle.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.957
[airily] Meet Bertie.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.791
He's slow and steady,

14:18.892 --> 14:21.628
and likes long walks
on short beaches.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.663
He's looking for a new owner

14:23.763 --> 14:25.832
who likes those same things,

14:25.933 --> 14:28.635
someone who has lots
of doggie biscuits

14:28.735 --> 14:31.204
and lots of love.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.407
- This is the one!
I found him!

14:34.507 --> 14:36.209
- [laughs]
- Peter?

14:36.309 --> 14:38.478
I didn't know
you wanted a dog.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.680
- I always have.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.916
I do like long walks,

14:43.016 --> 14:44.451
and short beaches.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.420
I'd love to be
your new best friend, Bertie.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.521
Ah!
[laughs]

14:48.621 --> 14:50.423
- I guess that's a match.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.791
- Compatible.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.526
- Yeah!
- Yay!

14:53.626 --> 14:55.963
- [barks excitedly]

14:56.063 --> 14:59.366
- I can't wait to show you
my flower shop, Bertie.

14:59.466 --> 15:00.633
- Next up,

15:00.733 --> 15:03.603
Queenie here tells me
her hobbies include

15:03.703 --> 15:05.605
nap time, ear tickles,

15:05.705 --> 15:07.607
and fine doggie dining.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.977
- Oh, I love fine dining,

15:10.077 --> 15:11.411
and I love your hair.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.413
It's long, just like mine!

15:13.513 --> 15:17.884
- I do like my hair brushed
100 times a day.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.653
- [gasps]
Me too!

15:20.753 --> 15:23.856
Oh, oh, uh,
can Queenie be mine?

15:23.957 --> 15:25.792
- Compatible.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.761
*

15:28.861 --> 15:31.098
- Just Rosie to go.

15:31.198 --> 15:34.667
- It sure has been great
getting to know you.

15:34.767 --> 15:39.172
You're gonna make someone
so very happy.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.673
Come on.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.643
It's time to find you
your forever home.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.945
You don't need to be shy.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.114
[crowd gasping]

15:47.214 --> 15:48.715
[variously] Aww.
Cute!

15:48.815 --> 15:51.851
- Rosie here is cuteness
on a leash.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.187
If you've got lots of love
to give--

15:54.287 --> 15:55.188
and apples--

15:55.288 --> 15:58.191
she'll be the perfect dog
for you.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.660
She's a little scared
of new people,

16:00.760 --> 16:03.563
so let's give her
a big hand.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.398
[applause]

16:05.498 --> 16:06.799
- Oh, she's so tiny!

16:06.899 --> 16:09.802
- Hey!
- [whimpers]

16:09.902 --> 16:11.404
- Hey.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.505
- [gasps] Oh, no.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.374
Rosie?
Come back!

16:14.474 --> 16:16.876
Rosie!

16:17.810 --> 16:19.446
[downbeat music]

16:19.546 --> 16:20.980
- Poor Rosie.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.415
How are we gonna find her?

16:22.515 --> 16:24.151
She could be anywhere.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.519
- Don't worry.
I'll go look for her.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.655
Finding dogs
is what I do.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.423
- Take this picture
to show people,

16:30.523 --> 16:31.891
in case anyone's seen her.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.993
- Thanks, Blair,
and never fear.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.196
No dog is too big
or too small

16:36.296 --> 16:39.932
to get past my eagle eyes!
Whoa!

16:40.033 --> 16:41.701
- I am more
of a medium dog.

16:41.801 --> 16:42.735
- Yum.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.304
- No, Violet!

16:44.404 --> 16:45.738
Not my lettuce!

16:45.838 --> 16:48.408
Oh, I give up.
Enjoy.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.009
- Cheer up, Blair.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.644
Scratch will find Rosie.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.580
- Yeah.
Come on, Blair.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.548
It'll be okay.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.617

- Hey, where'd Blair go?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.254
[car horn honks]
- Come on!

17:01.354 --> 17:03.456
I think I know
where Rosie could be.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.857
Rosie loves apples,

17:04.957 --> 17:06.493
and where are there
a lot of apples?

17:06.593 --> 17:08.061
Timmy's orchard!

17:08.161 --> 17:09.729
- Good thinking, Blair.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.998
[easygoing music]

17:12.099 --> 17:15.235
- Just the final apple to...

17:15.335 --> 17:17.737
[sneezes] go...

17:17.837 --> 17:19.206
What's that noise?

17:19.306 --> 17:20.607
[rumbling]

17:20.707 --> 17:21.674
Whoa!

17:21.774 --> 17:23.443
[crunching sound]
Huh?

17:23.543 --> 17:24.544
Rosie?

17:24.644 --> 17:26.746
What are you doing here?

17:26.846 --> 17:28.748
Ah...

17:28.848 --> 17:30.016
Choo!

17:30.117 --> 17:33.019

17:33.120 --> 17:34.521
Rosie!

17:37.324 --> 17:38.625
Uh-oh.

*

17:44.331 --> 17:45.565
- Timmy!

17:45.665 --> 17:47.234
- Hi, Timmy.
I don't suppose

17:47.334 --> 17:48.768
you've seen Rosie, have you?

17:48.868 --> 17:50.103
- Well, yes.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.272
As a matter of fact,
I have.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.540
- [whimpering]

17:53.640 --> 17:54.807
- [gasps] Rosie!

17:54.907 --> 17:57.144
- What's she doing
in a tree?

17:57.244 --> 17:59.112
- The one minute,
she was on the ground,

17:59.212 --> 18:00.680
and then--[sneezes]

18:00.780 --> 18:02.382
She was up in a tree.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.683
- Rosie,

18:03.783 --> 18:04.817
come on down!

18:04.917 --> 18:06.119
- [whimpers]

18:06.219 --> 18:07.954
- I think Rosie's too scared

18:08.054 --> 18:09.222
to come down on her own.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.657
- We'll have to go up
and get her.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.091
- But how?

18:12.192 --> 18:13.693
The ladder's too short,

18:13.793 --> 18:15.595
and Rosie's too high.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.063
We'll never get her down.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.299
- Never say never.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.467
Hm...

18:20.567 --> 18:23.002
That ladder might be too short
down here,

18:23.102 --> 18:25.238
but it won't be from up there!

18:25.338 --> 18:27.140
*

18:27.240 --> 18:28.408
Perfect.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.976
*

18:30.076 --> 18:32.312
This ribbon should keep
the ladder in place.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.913
Nice and sturdy.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.915
Now, we just need a harness.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.250
Let's see.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.153
My stretchiest hair elastics.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.754
And I just need
to tie them

18:41.854 --> 18:42.989
with these hair grips

18:43.089 --> 18:45.692
to my toughest hair nets

18:45.792 --> 18:47.894
and... ta-da!

18:47.994 --> 18:49.028
A harness!

18:49.128 --> 18:51.931
Now, my strongest ribbon.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.766
*

18:53.866 --> 18:55.868
There.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.670
Don't worry, Rosie.

18:57.770 --> 18:58.871
Here I come.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.441
- [whimpers]

19:01.541 --> 19:03.210
[all gasp]

19:03.310 --> 19:05.878
- I'll go, Sunny.
Rosie and I are friends.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.447
She trusts me.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.448
Right, Rosie?

19:08.548 --> 19:11.017
- [chirps]

19:11.117 --> 19:12.619
- Don't worry, Rosie.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.321
I'm coming to get you.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.022
- [whimpers]

19:16.122 --> 19:17.657
- Just hold on tight,

19:17.757 --> 19:19.526
and I'll make sure
you're okay.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.760
- [barks cheerfully]

19:20.860 --> 19:22.495
- Go, Blair!
- You got this.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.030
- [breathes deeply]

19:24.130 --> 19:25.498
I can do this.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.634
[suspenseful music]

19:27.734 --> 19:29.302
Yes!
Whoa.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.403
[all gasp]

19:30.503 --> 19:32.038
*

19:32.138 --> 19:33.840
Come on, Rosie.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.475
Climb aboard.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.544
- [whimpers]

19:37.644 --> 19:39.479
- We'll do this together.

19:39.579 --> 19:40.947
Gotcha!

19:41.047 --> 19:43.750
[upbeat music]

19:43.850 --> 19:45.818
- Good job, Blair.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.854
- Whew!
- [laughs]

19:47.954 --> 19:48.821
You did it!

19:48.921 --> 19:50.122
- There you go, Rosie.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.525
- Here, you can have an apple

19:52.625 --> 19:54.227
for being so brave.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.996
- Thanks, Timmy.
Apple, Rosie?

19:57.096 --> 19:59.699
- Well, I guess
we better get Rosie

19:59.799 --> 20:00.800
back to the pound.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.503
- I guess.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.939
I'm sure gonna miss you.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.541
- You know, Blair,

20:08.641 --> 20:09.976
I think Rosie

20:10.076 --> 20:12.078
may have found
her forever home after all.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.414
- Really?
With who?

20:14.514 --> 20:16.449
- With you.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.850
- Me?

20:17.950 --> 20:20.287
- You and Rosie
really love one another.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.422
- And it was you
who knew where she was

20:22.522 --> 20:23.423
when she ran off.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.292
- And you who saved her
from a tree.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.727
- And you both love apples!

20:27.827 --> 20:29.329
[sneezes]

20:29.429 --> 20:30.430
Oh!

20:30.530 --> 20:32.031
all: Gesundheit!

20:32.131 --> 20:34.901
- Remember what Scratch said?
Compatibility.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.670
I'd say you and Rosie
are meant to be.

20:37.770 --> 20:42.409
- Wow, I'd love to give Rosie
a forever home,

20:42.509 --> 20:45.211
if that's what she wants, too.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.979
- [chirps]
Blair.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.548
Forever home.

20:48.648 --> 20:49.816
- Aww.

20:49.916 --> 20:50.983
[triumphant music]

20:51.083 --> 20:52.084
- Compatible!

20:52.184 --> 20:53.620
- Awesome!
- Whoo-hoo!

20:53.720 --> 20:55.422
- Congratulations, Rosie.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.123
Welcome to your new
forever home.

20:57.223 --> 20:59.392
I'll leave you
to settle in.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.893
Then we'd better start planning

21:00.993 --> 21:03.029
for next year's
dog adoption day.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.397
- [whines affectionately]

21:04.497 --> 21:06.866
- Whew.
That was a big day.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.167
- And a good day.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.136
- And a "I'm so happy

21:10.236 --> 21:12.739
Rosie and I
found each other" day.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.307
- You'll make an awesome team,

21:14.407 --> 21:16.008
just like Sunny and me.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.477
- And Violet and me!

21:17.577 --> 21:20.747
[sighs] I love a happy
forever ending.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.350
- Mm...
Although..

21:23.450 --> 21:27.954
I think Rosie could use
one last touch.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.221
- Aww.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.057
- [gasps]
Perfect.

21:31.157 --> 21:32.859
- [barks happily]

21:32.959 --> 21:34.861
- [giggles]

21:34.961 --> 21:36.496
- Smile!

21:36.596 --> 21:40.833
Another one
for the Style Files.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.035
- Hi.
It's me, Sunny,

21:43.135 --> 21:45.104
with another look
inside the Style Files.

21:45.204 --> 21:48.608
What an amazing Doodle style.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.909
Wow!

21:50.009 --> 21:51.744
For this hairstyle and more,

21:51.844 --> 21:53.446
check out Sunny's style files

21:53.546 --> 21:54.847
at nickjr.com

21:54.947 --> 21:56.315
and the Nick Jr. app.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.951
Keep smiling.
Keep styling.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.353
[laughs]

22:04.557 --> 22:07.427
[upbeat music]
