To Dad. For being
the leader we need.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.400
Good boy.
Alfonso offered me a deal.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.480
When I asked you to marry me,
Cind, I meant it.

00:29.480 --> 00:32.440
Through thick and thin,
til death do us part, as they say.

00:32.440 --> 00:34.440
That family have done more
for me in a few weeks

00:34.440 --> 00:37.440
than you ever have done.
It's not safe for you here.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.480
Love... while we are alive,

And if we want to build
anything on that land...

00:56.920 --> 00:59.240
We gotta keep them sweet.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.720
The only reason
I'm here is because of you.

01:01.720 --> 01:05.240
You think I wanted this? I can't
stand back and watch you do this.

01:05.240 --> 01:07.920
She always comes running
back in the end.

01:09.360 --> 01:14.120
We received an anonymous tip-off.
The call came from your villa.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.320
Next time you come looking
for revenge,

01:16.320 --> 01:18.680

08:55.880 --> 08:57.760
Why shouldn't I?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.680
You put me here.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.760
Your corrupt system made me.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.080
They took my freedom
and left me to rot

09:08.080 --> 09:11.160
in a cell for a crime
I didn't commit.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.240
I know you've suffered,

09:19.240 --> 09:23.240
but killing me it's not gonna make
that pain go away.

09:23.240 --> 09:26.320
The same system that fucked you,
it's fucked me too,

09:26.320 --> 09:28.120
and now I'm just
an out of work copper

09:28.120 --> 09:29.840
trying to get justice for my friend.

09:33.280 --> 09:37.960
They took everything from me!

09:37.960 --> 09:39.960
EVERYTHING!

09:43.840 --> 09:45.800
One day we were a family...

09:46.680 --> 09:49.440
...and the next
Clarence was fucking gone.

09:50.720 --> 09:55.160
They took my child,
and they put me away...

09:57.000 --> 10:00.600
...I didn't mean to kill
your partner, I swear...

10:03.440 --> 10:06.640
...but I did mean to kill
the Lords for what they did to us.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.720
I can't do it anymore.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.440
I can't do it!

10:37.280 --> 10:38.960
I can't fucking do it!

10:38.960 --> 10:40.680
OK.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.400
Listen to me.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.200
Get on a plane with me.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.440
I'll see that you only do five
years for Russo,

10:49.440 --> 10:51.320
you'll serve two,

10:51.320 --> 10:54.120
and when you get out, you get
to live your life as a free woman.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.040
But I swear to you...

10:57.840 --> 11:00.880
...if you don't come with me
and face justice for what you did...

11:02.440 --> 11:05.120
...then I will tell the Lords
the truth about who you are...

11:05.960 --> 11:08.880
...and they will rip you to pieces
like a pack of wolves.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.680
It's your choice, kid.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.400
What about my son?

11:22.640 --> 11:25.120
I'm not going anywhere
without him.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.360
You've gotta roll the sleeves up?

11:35.720 --> 11:37.600
Looks a bit common.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.320
It's the Miami Vice look, Alb.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.640
Are you sure about this?

11:44.640 --> 11:46.520
Gotta have my General looking reem.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.160
I don't know what to say.
Don't say nothing.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.960
It's just good to see you smile.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.320
Eddie...

11:57.320 --> 12:00.400
my boys... my own boys...

12:01.520 --> 12:03.360
I was hard on them.

12:04.280 --> 12:07.120
They were just so slight.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.800
I wanted them
to be more than they were.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.520
But if I had the chance...

12:19.280 --> 12:21.120
...you know...

12:22.240 --> 12:24.120
...I might've done things different.

12:25.720 --> 12:27.720
They're gone now...

12:27.720 --> 12:29.440
but you...

12:30.600 --> 12:32.400
...there's still time.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.200
Don't let me...

12:40.800 --> 12:42.480
'Let you' what?

12:45.720 --> 12:48.320
Nothing. It doesn't matter.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.360
Look at you... Perfect.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.800
Save that for Ron.
Ron?

12:58.680 --> 13:01.520

13:04.840 --> 13:06.680
So, you go fetch your boy...

13:07.600 --> 13:11.240
...tomorrow night you meet me
at the Sunshine Motel in Alabasas.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.560
You will never have to look over
your shoulder again. I promise.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.160
You mind if I keep hold of the...

13:20.920 --> 13:24.480
You wouldn't walk into a bear pit
armed with a stick, would you?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.880
You've got one
hell of a dig you know.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.080
Sunshine Hotel, Mercy...

13:36.960 --> 13:38.640

13:40.720 --> 13:42.920
Hi. It's me...

13:43.800 --> 13:46.040
There's a diner
on the road to Alabasas.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.280
Meet me there.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.200

14:12.120 --> 14:14.520
You'll always be my... General.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.240
That's right.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.480
I... There's something
I wanted to tell you.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.840
It's about the Gitanos...
I think it...

14:31.120 --> 14:32.720
I think it might help...

14:32.720 --> 14:35.160
Well, I could do with all
the help I can get at the moment.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.040
I messed up, Dad.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.240
I really messed up.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.080

14:49.880 --> 14:52.040

14:53.280 --> 14:57.040
Manuela... The gypsy girl she, er...
What have you done, boy?

14:57.040 --> 14:59.240
The gavvers were coming...

14:59.240 --> 15:01.120
and she... she screamed...

15:01.120 --> 15:03.120
and I tried to shut her...
shut her up...

15:03.120 --> 15:05.600
because I didn't wanna blow the operation,

15:05.600 --> 15:08.400
you know, I didn't wanna...
I didn't wanna upset you.

15:09.560 --> 15:10.880
And I just put my...

15:10.880 --> 15:13.120
put my hand over her mouth...

15:13.120 --> 15:14.440
She was...

15:14.440 --> 15:18.360
She was so kind to me, Dad.
She was so fucking kind.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.080
And I just...

15:22.520 --> 15:25.480
I swear I never meant to hurt her,
you know I didn't.

15:25.480 --> 15:27.680
Come here...
I didn't.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.640
Sorry, Dad. Sorry

15:39.800 --> 15:41.480
Who else know about this?

15:45.040 --> 15:46.760
Just Ma...

15:50.120 --> 15:54.040
She helped me with the, erm...
She helped me bury her.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.800

but something tells me
you're at it.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.080
Just taking my boy for a spin.

18:42.080 --> 18:45.000
Last time you did that,
he still pissed the bed.

18:46.080 --> 18:49.360
Kelly. Tell Ma.
He told me what happened.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.240
How you covered it up
and lied to me.

18:52.360 --> 18:54.320
I was protecting my child.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.640
Well, now he wants
to absolve himself, don't ya?

18:57.640 --> 19:00.440
No.
That's what he wants.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.760
I said n-
Ma, fuck sake, please.

19:03.760 --> 19:07.040
Let the boy act for himself. Ugh.

19:07.040 --> 19:11.120
You will not allow
your own son to hand himself in!

19:11.960 --> 19:15.160
Shame on you, hideous man!

19:15.160 --> 19:17.360
Can't you see
what's happening, Kell?

19:17.360 --> 19:19.520
I won't allow it!

19:19.520 --> 19:21.600
Just because this full time cunt

19:21.600 --> 19:23.760
wants to get
his fucking hotel built!

19:24.840 --> 19:27.000
No!
Well you covered up his mess,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
so you fucking well
get him out of it.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.840
FUCK!

19:59.640 --> 20:02.040
You working behind that bar
the night we met,

20:02.040 --> 20:03.840
weren't just chance, was it?

20:03.840 --> 20:05.760
You knew I'd be in there.

20:06.920 --> 20:10.880
And you coming to the scrapyard,
killing that policeman.

20:13.520 --> 20:17.000
I couldn't afford to lose you.
I needed you.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.720
And there was me thinking,
you'd do anything for me.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.400
Do you know
what hurts the most, Cindy?

20:22.400 --> 20:24.480
Is that you fucking saw me
as weak.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.400
The obvious target, an easy mark.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.280
At first, yeah, maybe. But...

20:32.160 --> 20:33.600
...things changed.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.880
Everything's different now.
I love you.

20:35.880 --> 20:37.800
Do me a fucking favour.

20:39.040 --> 20:42.240
You don't even know the meaning
of the word, not even as a mother.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.320
I'm not looking
for your forgiveness, Gene.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.080
I just want you to understand me.

20:50.080 --> 20:53.360
You killed my uncle! My nephew!

20:53.360 --> 20:55.280
What exactly do you want me
to understand?

20:55.280 --> 20:57.560
What they took from me!

20:57.560 --> 21:00.120
Your family, your father!

21:00.120 --> 21:03.440
He took everything from me!
Clarence. Eddie.

21:03.440 --> 21:06.000
My whole fucking life!

21:15.880 --> 21:17.720
If you don't love me...

21:19.040 --> 21:21.040
...just kill me.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.160
Do us a cup of tea, will you, Carl.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.120
Did you not hear what I said?
I said, "Do us a cup of tea."

21:33.120 --> 21:37.840
You want tea?
Do it yourself... cunt.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.120
Carly, baby.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.160
You've got one role
in this family...

21:44.280 --> 21:47.280
...and that's to shut up
and look half presentable.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.720
You don't even know me!

22:08.720 --> 22:12.920
You've never asked me a single
question in 20 fucking years!

22:13.800 --> 22:17.920
All you do
is order me around and brass me off,

22:17.920 --> 22:19.840
like you're doing with Leonard.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.920
What happens
between me and Leonard

22:21.920 --> 22:23.960
is none of your business.

22:25.560 --> 22:27.600
He's my boy,

22:27.600 --> 22:29.800
and you will never get between us...

22:30.920 --> 22:32.720
...because you're not smart enough.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.480
He's my husband.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.200
Really?

22:43.640 --> 22:47.160
Do you know what he does
when your back's turned?

22:48.720 --> 22:51.680
He hunts
for what you can't give him.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.800
He sneaks around in the shadows.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.360
Looking for love.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.920
Looking for cock.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.440
And that's something
you'll never be able to give him.

23:10.120 --> 23:12.000
You think I don't know my husband?

23:12.000 --> 23:15.840
I've been with him
more than half my life.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.120
Of course I know what he does,

23:19.120 --> 23:21.560
and it doesn't change
the way I feel about him...

23:22.480 --> 23:24.080
...because he's my best friend,

23:24.080 --> 23:26.360
and nothing will ever
come between us.

23:26.360 --> 23:30.520
So, when you send him off
to do your dirty work,

23:31.440 --> 23:34.080
you're hurting me as well as him...

23:35.280 --> 23:40.240
...and behind your back,
when you can't bully him...

23:43.000 --> 23:45.560
...he fucking hates you.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.400
Why are you telling me
this now, Cindy?

23:58.400 --> 24:02.640
Lindsey, that police officer.
She offered me a deal.

24:04.120 --> 24:07.640
I... I do a couple of years
in prison for Russo,

24:07.640 --> 24:10.000
and me and Eddie get
to live out our lives out in peace.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.600
Then you don't want
my understanding!

24:11.600 --> 24:13.560
You're only telling me
cos you've got no choice!

24:13.560 --> 24:15.800
No! No!

24:16.720 --> 24:18.880
I'm telling you, cos...

24:18.880 --> 24:20.840
cos you could come
with me and Eddie.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.440
Just get outta this place,

24:24.440 --> 24:26.880
you had the right idea from the off,

24:26.880 --> 24:29.320
stay away from your father.
He's poisoning you.

24:29.320 --> 24:31.640
And what makes you
any different from him?

24:32.520 --> 24:37.400
My own Dad grassed on us
and killed the operation dead. Why?

24:38.400 --> 24:41.240
Because he couldn't
handle the fact

24:41.240 --> 24:44.200
that we were doing better
without him.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.960
But at least with him
I know what I'm dealing with.

24:50.880 --> 24:53.160
The difference between us...

24:54.120 --> 24:56.520
...is that I never
enjoyed seeing you suffer.

24:57.640 --> 24:59.320
Never!

25:19.840 --> 25:21.800
Take your fucking deal.

25:21.800 --> 25:24.560
And get as far away from here
as possible before anyone else

25:24.560 --> 25:26.280

25:27.240 --> 25:29.880

35:20.160 --> 35:22.640
...you're my brothers, right?

35:24.560 --> 35:26.240
And I love you.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.920
I'm not gonna sit here
and watch him destroy us any longer.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.320
If I do this, I need you both
to stand with me,

35:34.320 --> 35:35.680
shoulder to shoulder...

35:47.080 --> 35:49.920
Tony kept this smudge of him and Alb
from when they were kids.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.720
It's too late for regret, Mum.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.600
I always knew it would be you.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.880
You're the only one
with true resolve.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.320
The real "gantse macher."

36:20.480 --> 36:22.120
I didn't want it...

36:25.200 --> 36:26.880
...it's me now.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.160
You can take the boy
out of South London,

36:31.160 --> 36:33.600
but you can't take
South London out of the boy.

36:40.920 --> 36:42.840
Look at you...

36:46.400 --> 36:48.520
...Lord by name...

36:48.520 --> 36:50.440
...Lord by nature.

37:27.960 --> 37:30.200
You seem to get on well
with my son, mush.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.640
Buenos dias, Senor Lord.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.440
Albert, please.

37:34.440 --> 37:37.320
It's true,
I do get on well with your son.

37:38.280 --> 37:41.320
So much so, that after you sent him
to my house to threaten me,

37:42.360 --> 37:43.920
he couldn't go through with it.

37:43.920 --> 37:46.800
I've never hidden who
I am from anybody.

37:49.880 --> 37:52.280
So, if you think
you can blackmail me,

37:52.280 --> 37:53.520
you are wrong.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.760
What do you take me for? Eh?

37:55.760 --> 37:59.600
You think that I'd out you as a puff
to the good people of Alabasas?

37:59.600 --> 38:02.600
Look, if you're an iron,
you crack on. I don't give a fuck.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.240
It's just you're doing land
deals with your boyfriend,

38:05.240 --> 38:07.400
who's a criminal.
And that makes you,

38:07.400 --> 38:09.560
if I'm not mistaken, corrupt.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.080
And your whole reputation here
is based on

38:13.080 --> 38:17.000
that man of integrity bullshit
that you peddle around the Island.

38:19.080 --> 38:22.080
You're in, mukka, deep in.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.920
You signed a deal,
and you'll fucking stick to it.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.400
Buenos Dias.

38:47.560 --> 38:49.240
Thanks, babe.

38:51.680 --> 38:54.600
How did it go with Cesar?

38:55.480 --> 38:57.080
It didn't.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.560
Like him, don't you?

39:05.280 --> 39:06.800
I can tell.

39:07.640 --> 39:10.280
He's not just some fella
you met down the Dilly, is he?

39:13.520 --> 39:15.360
Whatever it was...

39:17.800 --> 39:20.000
...I've fucked it.

39:21.880 --> 39:26.040
You know, despite everything
your father's done to you,

39:26.040 --> 39:28.520
and everything you've
had to do to survive...

39:29.400 --> 39:32.840
...when I look in your eyes,

39:32.840 --> 39:35.000
I still see such goodness.

39:40.960 --> 39:44.720
Please, don't...
don't leave me, Len.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.600
I couldn't bear to lose you.

39:50.280 --> 39:54.080
Carl, I'd never leave you.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.480
You're my best friend.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.600
And you're a Lord.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.320
Am I?

40:03.320 --> 40:05.320
For better or for worse.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.080
Do anything for you, you know that.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.960
Then give me another baby.

40:22.880 --> 40:27.120
Put another child in me, Leonard.
That is all I want.
