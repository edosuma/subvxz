If you wanna know the secret
to a woman's heart, this is it.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.853
Men that dance always get lucky.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.470
Always push off
from the middle off your right.

05:45.553 --> 05:47.430
Push hard. Push.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.891
Right, are you patting my ass,
or are you making me move?

05:51.225 --> 05:52.060
You see?

06:18.378 --> 06:20.338
Wow! Y'all freaking me out.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.938
The Western Swing, kinda.
You know, it's a two-step.

06:37.021 --> 06:38.773
-We're gonna go like this.
-Oh, my!

06:38.856 --> 06:41.192
-That happened when I was five.
- Slow. There you go.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.194
-Quick, quick, slow.
-Whoo!

06:43.277 --> 06:44.112
-Whoa!
-Glide.

06:44.195 --> 06:47.115
-She's leading, Tan.
-Quick, quick, slow. There you go.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.408
Now just repeat.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.451
Now, you're not a baby.
Don't look at your feet.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.706
Guys, listen, the secret
to this is to slide your feet.

06:55.790 --> 06:59.001
Don't break your foot. You're too slow.

06:59.085 --> 06:59.919
-Slow.
-Too quick.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.796
Again too slow.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.467
Daddy long legs! Shoot! I'm like, "Whoa!"

07:08.344 --> 07:11.556
Look at his great shirt, man.
He's got a horse on him.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.057
Take the horse and ride.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.603
-Okay.
-Y'all are beautiful, man.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.820
Before we leave,
we're gonna do the "Cotton-Eyed Joe."

07:25.903 --> 07:28.156
What you sayin'? Bullshit.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.241
-Bullshit!
-Thank you, Kyle.

07:30.324 --> 07:33.578
One, two, tap, travel, and…

07:33.661 --> 07:38.166
One, two, three, four, five…

07:39.959 --> 07:41.335
Six!

07:41.419 --> 07:42.795
-Round again.
-One, two!

07:42.879 --> 07:44.046
One, two!

07:44.130 --> 07:45.298
Bullshit!

07:45.381 --> 07:46.424
Circle to the left.

07:46.507 --> 07:47.383
Bullshit!

07:53.639 --> 07:55.057
Good luck. Wish me luck.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.937
I'm scared. I'm scared.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.851
-I wonder what it looks like over here.
-Hello! Look at my ceiling.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.637
Is it a wig?

21:29.871 --> 21:33.667
I'm just protective of me, 'cause if I
don't shine my buttons, nobody else does.

23:31.034 --> 23:33.870
Like to get me out,
you're gonna have to have a potato peeler.

34:59.222 --> 35:02.266
I don't want any unveiling, you know.

38:04.198 --> 38:05.866
-Ain't you sweet.
-Right. Oh!
