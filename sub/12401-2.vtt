03:28.142 --> 03:31.543

     Why are you laughin'?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.229
       This isn't a joke.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.298
    Church is not optional.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.035
     This is the only thing

03:57.037 --> 03:59.504
     that will fortify us...

03:59.506 --> 04:01.406
          sustain us...

04:02.509 --> 04:04.610
     inoculate us
     against the darkness.

04:10.517 --> 04:14.686
        Ezekiel urges us
        to be prepared.

04:14.688 --> 04:18.423
              Be... prepared.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.262

04:26.267 --> 04:28.367
     <i> But there is one thing</i>

04:28.369 --> 04:30.035
      <i> that should never</i>

04:30.037 --> 04:33.038
  <i> because we know it is there,</i>
  <i> always lurkin',</i>

04:33.040 --> 04:35.974
  ready to seize us
  in our moments of weakness.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.411
       Five mornings ago,

04:39.413 --> 04:43.215
  when I awoke, I was prepared
  for nothing more than...

04:43.217 --> 04:46.752
      another glorious day
      in God's creation.

04:46.754 --> 04:47.819
          (crinkling)

04:49.456 --> 04:52.391
        But by day's end...

04:52.393 --> 04:55.627
       I was doing battle
       with a servant
       of Satan himself.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.230
        Evil incarnate.

04:58.232 --> 05:01.366
   Evil wearing a face
   that no one would expect.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.970
        A child's face.

05:09.943 --> 05:15.147
   <i> A face contorted, twisted.</i>

05:17.084 --> 05:19.217
   <i> Sweet innocence corrupted.</i>

05:20.754 --> 05:22.087
   <i> Vomiting a foul blackness</i>

05:22.089 --> 05:23.622
    <i> that could only had come</i>
    <i> from the deepest,</i>

05:23.624 --> 05:24.656
     <i> darkest pits of hell.</i>

05:24.658 --> 05:27.592
   <i> I was furious with myself,</i>

05:27.594 --> 05:29.127
       because I had
       not been vigilant.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.529
      I was not prepared.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.333
      I let my guard down...

05:35.302 --> 05:37.135
      and evil slipped in.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.004
     Well, that's not gonna
     happen again,

05:39.006 --> 05:43.475
     because it is my job
     to prepare each of us

05:43.477 --> 05:46.278
  to recognize the dark forces,

05:46.280 --> 05:50.415
   and that means more butts
   in these pews...

05:52.286 --> 05:54.519
 because the battle is comin'!

05:54.521 --> 05:56.621
  <i> And unless we're prepared,</i>

05:56.623 --> 06:00.192
 <i> that darkness will spew forth</i>
 <i> with the reek of a sewer...</i>

06:01.195 --> 06:04.696
       drowning us
       in its corruption.

06:05.632 --> 06:09.634
      We will choke on it,
      gag on it,

06:09.636 --> 06:12.537
   <i> and then the black pit</i>
   <i> of hell will await us all.</i>

06:14.174 --> 06:16.308
       I appreciate
       your comin' today.

06:16.310 --> 06:19.044
WOMAN:
I could've done without
some of that saucy language.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.313
Puttin' people's
backsides in seats.

06:21.315 --> 06:23.181
     Maybe it's a minor blessin'

06:23.183 --> 06:25.350
  there weren't more people here
  to hear me workin' "blue."

06:25.352 --> 06:27.886
   Well, I like when you put

06:27.888 --> 06:30.489
   a little pepper
   on your pitches, Reverend.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.392
              Why, Mildred,
              you make me blush.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.327
         Enjoy the rest
         of your Sunday, ladies.

06:35.329 --> 06:36.995
       Bye-bye now.
              May God bless you
              and keep you.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.730
You too, Reverend.
          Bye-bye.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.998
           Bye-bye.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.268
      Okay, enjoy the rest
      of your Sunday.

06:49.343 --> 06:50.442
                   Stop it.

06:51.678 --> 06:54.346
    She was staring at me
    like she saw a ghost.

06:54.348 --> 06:57.249
           You were gone a while
           and now you're back.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.785
            That makes you
            mysterious, I guess.

07:01.522 --> 07:05.223
(door closes)
Did you tell them about
what happened with Joshua?

07:05.225 --> 07:07.192
            How could I not?

07:07.194 --> 07:10.295
         Boy was sitting there
         like he'd been through
         a meat grinder.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.598
            I didn't say
            anything about you,

07:13.600 --> 07:15.734
            but they need
            to know the story.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.102
It's not just a story.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.238
 It's true.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.007
             Hell, yes, it is.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.378
People will tell ya

07:26.380 --> 07:28.447
        this is full of stories.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.118
   But what good are they
   if people don't believe them?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.886
You sure it's over?

07:34.888 --> 07:37.556
   Joshua's... okay?

07:37.558 --> 07:39.458
               You jokin'?

07:40.394 --> 07:41.893
    You saw the demon leave him.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.995
You know, that day
with my mother, when she...

07:47.100 --> 07:49.734
I don't remember it happening
like that with her.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.470
       I'll tell you what I saw.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.539
            I saw a kind
            and gentle woman...

07:55.576 --> 07:57.509
             transformed
             into a monster...

07:58.812 --> 08:01.880
       finally freed of the evil
       pulling her strings.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.749
         You freed her, Kyle.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.451
Is that what I did?

08:06.453 --> 08:07.652
              Absolutely.

08:23.337 --> 08:26.271
Well, what have we got here?

08:26.273 --> 08:27.939
         Where's Caleb?

08:27.941 --> 08:30.275
   He had to go over to Wheeling
   to see his sister.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.811
Mm-hmm...
           So, I'm being handy.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.279
        (laughs)

08:34.280 --> 08:36.181
  I thought you were
  gonna leave that.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.783
"Turn the other cheek."
                     Honestly...

08:38.784 --> 08:40.952
         I don't mind...

08:40.953 --> 08:43.288
       folks having a bit of fun
       at my expense.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.123
        Goes with the territory.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.858
        But things have changed.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.328
       Maybe it's time to start
       sweatin' the small stuff.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.464
                   Hey...

08:52.466 --> 08:55.834
      ever wonder it's a chicken
      and egg scenario?

08:55.836 --> 08:58.670
         The more you preach
         hellfire and brimstone,

08:58.672 --> 09:00.639
               the more riled up
               people get.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.341
If you'd seen what I'd seen,
you'd know that people need
to be riled up.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.476
           Now, I got your back.

09:04.478 --> 09:06.645
      Whether it cost me or not,
      you know that.

09:06.647 --> 09:10.815
      But that boy you picked up
      as a partner...

09:10.817 --> 09:14.319
  just showin' his face
  around here got folks talkin'.

09:14.321 --> 09:18.323
  He has a talent.
           Well, that's one way
           to put it.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.659
      Look, I know it ain't been
      easy for that boy,

09:20.661 --> 09:22.360
                but Kyle Barnes
                has been trouble

09:22.362 --> 09:24.329
     since he was ten years old.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.565
Like you and I,
we didn't raise Cain

09:26.567 --> 09:27.832
in our day, you know?

09:27.834 --> 09:30.268
              We were young,
              drunk, and stupid.
         Oh, yeah.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.505
              Yes, we were.

09:33.507 --> 09:37.576
         But that boy comes from
         a much darker place.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.411
        Folks say he should have
        been locked up,

09:39.413 --> 09:41.913
      and current events
      don't change that opinion.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.417
              Hope you know
              what you're doin'.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.586
           Thank you.
           (humphs)

10:06.073 --> 10:07.439
LOWELL:
I need to talk to Chief.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.074
          What the hell
          you got there, Lowell?

10:09.076 --> 10:10.775
I need to talk to Chief.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.044
       Well, the chief's out.
          GILES: Chief's back.

10:13.046 --> 10:16.047
               What in the hell
               is going on here?

10:16.049 --> 10:18.883
  Last time I called this in,
  ain't nobody come out
  and do anything.

10:18.885 --> 10:20.251
      This time, I figured
      I come down there

10:20.253 --> 10:21.953
  and light a fire
  under your department's ass.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.623
      Well, you might've put it
      in a bag that didn't leak.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.224
                    Oh...

10:26.226 --> 10:29.260
     That looks like clean cuts.
  Well, it ain't roadkill,

10:29.262 --> 10:30.428
      if that's what
      you're getting at.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.896
Critter right there
was killed with a blade

10:31.898 --> 10:33.098
     fancy-like and nailed up.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.399
               "Nailed up"?

10:34.401 --> 10:36.067
   All of them out there
   like some kind of display.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.569
    Sent my dogs wild crazy.

10:37.571 --> 10:39.070
           You see anything else
           out there?

10:39.072 --> 10:41.139
          Spray paint? Graffiti?

10:41.141 --> 10:42.907
This ain't the Crips, Chief.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.076
       You see any kids
       roaming around out there?

10:45.078 --> 10:46.778
              Aaron McCready?
              Any of that bunch?

10:46.780 --> 10:49.414
    No. My dogs keep
    most everybody away.
Mm-hmm.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.749
                 You said "all."
            Mm-hmm.

10:50.751 --> 10:51.750
                   There's more?
          Yeah.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.451
Six of them by my count.
              Six?

10:53.453 --> 10:55.153
   Cut like that
   and then nailed like that.

10:58.425 --> 10:59.658
        (piano playing)

11:02.162 --> 11:04.162

11:30.824 --> 11:32.090
Hello, Mom.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.727
Somethin' happened
a couple of days ago.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.197
  I think, uh...

11:42.169 --> 11:44.536
I think I might have helped
save a little boy.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.911
Reverend says that
I saved you, too.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.581
All I know is
I put you here.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.551
I made you like this.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.060
After what you did to me...

12:11.865 --> 12:14.299
I told myself I'd never
lose a minute of sleep.

12:23.877 --> 12:27.245
You remember when
you used to read to me?

12:30.183 --> 12:32.150
   Outside in that
   big ol' hammock?

25:06.272 --> 25:08.072
            Just try to keep up.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.042
         (scoffs)

25:19.352 --> 25:20.551
KYLE:
Shit.

25:22.522 --> 25:23.921
Come on, Mom.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.357
    It's good. Check it out.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.372
                  (coughs)

25:47.179 --> 25:48.412
        (sighs)

26:10.336 --> 26:11.368
             SARAH:
             Kyle?

26:11.370 --> 26:12.503
         (door rattles)

26:12.505 --> 26:13.938
Are you out there?

26:15.174 --> 26:16.774
It's so dark.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.610
(grunts)

26:20.546 --> 26:23.080
Kyle. Honey...

26:23.082 --> 26:25.249
 you have to
 let me out of here.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.452
Honey, I'm scared.

26:30.590 --> 26:33.123
       Please, baby.
       Just let me out.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.995
       I know I hurt you.

26:39.599 --> 26:42.433
              And I am so sorry.

26:42.435 --> 26:45.369
             I love you so much.

26:45.371 --> 26:48.706
               I promise you
               it won't happen
               ever again, okay?

26:48.708 --> 26:50.541
                      I promise.

26:50.543 --> 26:51.942
                           Kyle?

26:51.944 --> 26:53.777
                           Baby?

26:57.116 --> 26:58.315

27:04.957 --> 27:06.023
   Thank you.

27:07.093 --> 27:09.393
    She still having
    a hard time with the...

27:09.395 --> 27:10.561
    arrangement?

27:10.563 --> 27:11.929
           For the first
           couple of months,

27:11.931 --> 27:13.764
          she'd set three places
          at supper.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.232
  It was easier just to let her.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.301
                Beat the sobbing
                and screaming.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.269
         She was locking herself
         in the closet.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.738
         But it's been
         a little better lately.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.306
             She's not having
             as many outbursts.

27:22.308 --> 27:25.109
         The ones she does have
         tend to be aimed at me.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.277
      She can't understand
      why Kyle has to stay away,

27:27.279 --> 27:29.046
      but it's clearly my fault.

27:30.583 --> 27:31.915
                Um...

27:31.917 --> 27:33.817
    you know, mostly,
    we just don't talk about it.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.953
Avoidance isn't healthy,

27:35.955 --> 27:37.988
 not for a seven-year-old.

27:40.826 --> 27:42.259

  Oh, no. Not at all.

27:42.261 --> 27:43.594
             I'll be right back.

27:43.596 --> 27:45.929

28:18.831 --> 28:20.464
  Thanks for, uh...

28:20.466 --> 28:23.133
    helping me with
    Operation Butts in Pews.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.334
                      (chuckles)

28:24.336 --> 28:26.170
             Well, it is my duty
             as a recruit

28:26.172 --> 28:28.138
             to Anderson's army,

28:28.140 --> 28:30.641
   but I-- I think you're gonna
   have to find a better name.

28:30.643 --> 28:32.543
  You see?
  You're helping me already.

28:32.545 --> 28:34.511
                Come in, please.

28:34.513 --> 28:35.612
           Thank you.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.682
        Is your son here?
        I mean, I--

28:38.684 --> 28:40.317
Oh, no. Aaron's out
with friends,

28:40.319 --> 28:43.721
so he won't be home
'til late, if at all.

28:43.723 --> 28:44.788
        Oh.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.659
              And, uh...

28:48.661 --> 28:50.194
        I made a blackberry pie.

28:50.196 --> 28:51.829
       Oh, wow.

28:51.831 --> 28:52.996
        Mmm.
        (sniffs)

28:52.998 --> 28:55.666
You really are the temptress.
                    (chuckles)

28:55.668 --> 28:58.836
How can I resist?
  (phone beeps)

28:58.838 --> 29:00.070
Oh, excuse me.

29:02.675 --> 29:03.907
Hi, this is Reverend Anderson.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.476
  It really is a glorious day.

29:06.512 --> 29:07.778
           Yes, I am.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.080
             When?

29:11.684 --> 29:12.950
    You tried calling him back?

29:14.220 --> 29:15.753
             Um...

29:16.889 --> 29:18.422
      Yeah, I imagine so.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.358
          Yes, I will.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.426
           Thank you.

29:28.734 --> 29:30.701
           I'm really sorry.

29:30.703 --> 29:33.270
Church business?
             Indirectly, yes.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.105
      Well, I hope that,
      uh, I can get a rain check

29:35.107 --> 29:36.440
        on dinner sometime soon.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.376
   Sure.
                   Great. Okay.

29:39.378 --> 29:40.878
         Okay.
                         Bye.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.112
           Bye.

29:46.719 --> 29:48.619
     MARK:
     If this is the deer trail
     we've been following,

29:48.621 --> 29:51.922
                  and this is
                  the fire road,
                  then we're--

29:51.924 --> 29:53.190
          We're here.

29:54.727 --> 29:57.227
    What?

29:57.229 --> 30:00.564
  Well, he said it was just past
  a shagbark hickory.

30:00.566 --> 30:03.367
  The man draws a shitty map,
  but he knows his trees.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.471
   Oh, shit, Chief.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.140
            Come here.
            Take a look at this.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.083
    My Lord.

30:20.085 --> 30:21.652
      I never.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.061
                   Look at that.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.473
                   All looking
                   the same way.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.742
Some crazy ass trail.

31:02.127 --> 31:04.127
             What have you done?
   Are you alone?

31:04.129 --> 31:05.729
She's here, isn't she?

31:10.135 --> 31:11.668
           Wait! How did you--

31:11.670 --> 31:14.638
   I'm listed as your mother's
   emergency contact.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.807
      The Director of Facilities
      called me personally.

31:16.809 --> 31:17.875
         He was not happy.

31:17.877 --> 31:19.543
         What were you thinkin'?

31:19.545 --> 31:21.879
    Look, you should see the way
    they're taking care of her
    in there.

31:21.881 --> 31:25.182
   I mean, that place is awful--
  Jesus Christ, Kyle!

31:25.184 --> 31:27.851
Sarah's barely getting by
with a nurse's care.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.386
The staff and nurses
are around the clock,

31:29.388 --> 31:31.822
and you're gonna
do it all by yourself?

31:31.824 --> 31:34.157
How about feeding her?
You tried that yet?

31:34.159 --> 31:35.993
  What if you have to
  go somewhere?

31:35.995 --> 31:37.995
 You can't leave her alone.
 What if something
 happens to you?

31:37.997 --> 31:41.164
  Come on, Kyle!
            What if things could
            be like they were?

31:41.166 --> 31:43.033
        Do you know what I mean?
        I mean, Joshua, he--

31:43.035 --> 31:44.735
           He's-- He's whatever
           you want to call it--

31:44.737 --> 31:47.738
     cleansed, free.
The demon left that boy.

31:47.740 --> 31:50.173
You saw it yourself.
       Yeah, it wasn't like that
       with my mother!

31:50.175 --> 31:52.409
  If I drove it out of her too,
  then why is she lying in there

31:52.411 --> 31:55.579
              like a fucking--
              like that?

31:57.716 --> 31:59.049
    You know, exorcisms,

31:59.051 --> 32:02.185
they're different
as the souls they taint.

32:02.187 --> 32:03.487
     Now, it's gone.

32:04.857 --> 32:08.425
And when it went away...

32:08.427 --> 32:10.527
that thing, it took
part of Sarah with it.

32:10.529 --> 32:11.528
    Yeah, but what if it didn't?

32:11.530 --> 32:13.163
         What if it's still
         inside of her?

32:14.366 --> 32:16.366
         Kyle...
          We could drive it out.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.101
   I mean, we could wake her up.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.137
       (sighs)

32:35.387 --> 32:38.622
Oh-ho, what we got here?

32:49.468 --> 32:50.534
                  Police.

33:00.245 --> 33:01.478
          It's clear.

33:09.755 --> 33:10.854
                 Huh.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.326
              It's just animals.

33:22.935 --> 33:24.034
             Maybe.

33:35.614 --> 33:40.050
 Lord, in Your name
 and the name of your son...

33:42.855 --> 33:45.722
    we ask You to look down
    on this troubled soul.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.460
      By your divine power

33:50.462 --> 33:51.862
      and the power
      of the Holy Gospel...

33:54.666 --> 33:57.300
       release this woman
       from her torment

33:57.302 --> 33:59.002
      at the hands
      of the beast within.

33:59.004 --> 34:00.470
                    (grunts)
              (groans)

34:00.472 --> 34:01.538
             (growls)

34:02.508 --> 34:05.008
         The destroyer,
         the deceiver,

34:05.010 --> 34:09.679
 the unclean, the unholy shall
 wither and be washed away...

34:09.681 --> 34:11.148
          (sizzling)
           (screams)

34:11.150 --> 34:13.050
  by the purity and the light
  of Your love.

34:13.052 --> 34:14.150
     (grunts)

34:14.152 --> 34:16.152
    In the name of Your son,

34:16.155 --> 34:17.654
   our savior, Jesus Christ,

34:17.656 --> 34:19.656
       I demand this evil
       to be cast out.

34:19.658 --> 34:22.159
We stand as instruments
of your righteous power!

34:22.161 --> 34:23.827
        It's not doing anything.
        That's just words.

34:23.829 --> 34:24.895
          We gotta do something.

34:24.897 --> 34:27.831
In the name of God,
I command you begone!

34:27.833 --> 34:28.931
           That's not working!
         Kyle!

34:32.170 --> 34:33.670
I'm sorry, son.
           No.

34:33.672 --> 34:35.739
She's already free.
             No.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.239
Kyle.
          Dammit, no!

34:38.877 --> 34:40.409
  There's somethin' else.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.315
            (grunts)

34:51.223 --> 34:52.255
             Kyle!
                  No!

34:52.257 --> 34:54.024
    Stop it! Stop!
              (grunts)

34:54.025 --> 34:55.425
        Let go! Let go!

34:57.863 --> 34:59.096
            (groans)

35:05.370 --> 35:06.736
            No!
             Come on! Stop this!

35:06.738 --> 35:08.038
                  Come on.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.673
             (grunts)
            Aah!

35:11.777 --> 35:12.976
              No.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.624
It worked on Joshua.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.126
It worked before.

35:30.129 --> 35:31.695
      It worked on Sarah.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.498
    That was a long time ago.

35:37.402 --> 35:38.535
       (breathes heavily)

35:43.242 --> 35:44.808
  ALLISON:
  Who's that one from, honey?

35:48.914 --> 35:50.814
       Emo.
                         "Emo"?

35:50.816 --> 35:53.016
Amber, no one you invited
