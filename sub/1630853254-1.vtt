00:02.000 --> 00:08.040
This programme contains scenes
which some viewers may find upsetting
from the start

00:38.760 --> 00:41.720
If I can come back again,
I'd be a baker.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.080
Why a baker? I love cake.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.800
I'd make constant cakes.

00:50.800 --> 00:54.520
You could be a baker now,
after the war.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.560
Come back, be a baker.

00:57.880 --> 01:01.920
If you die, what's the plan for
the next life?

01:01.920 --> 01:04.560
I can be anything I want?
Anything you want.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.960
Can I be a man?
Absolutely. Be a man.

01:08.680 --> 01:10.480
What sort of man?

01:10.480 --> 01:11.760
I don't know.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.320
Maybe I'll want to come back as me.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.520
But I'd do things better.

01:19.520 --> 01:22.160
If you came back, would you want
the same family?

01:23.560 --> 01:25.680
Me as your brother? Definitely.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.120
Pamela? Jimmy? Mm-hm.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.720
Mum and Dad? Mm-hm. Maurice?

01:31.360 --> 01:32.520
Enh.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.720
THEY LAUGH

01:36.200 --> 01:42.240
What if we could come back
and live it all over again

01:42.240 --> 01:44.480
and again and again?

01:47.480 --> 01:49.200
Wouldn't that be fantastic?

01:53.120 --> 01:55.280
They're the two best words
in the English language,

01:55.280 --> 01:58.320
when you put them together,
aren't they?

02:00.720 --> 02:02.200
What if?

02:33.760 --> 02:36.960
SHE GROANS

02:36.960 --> 02:39.960
Dr Fellows should be here.
Why isn't he here? Where is he?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.160
Your man will be stuck
in the snow, I bet.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.360
Oh, sure dreadful wild out there.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.720
The road will be closed.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.200
Come here.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.320
SHE GROANS

02:51.880 --> 02:53.520
The other end.

03:07.480 --> 03:11.560
GROANS INTENSIFY

03:15.520 --> 03:18.640
Oh, ma'am, she's white,
like a ghost.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.560
A girl? The cord's wrapped around
her neck.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.840
Oh, Mary, mother of God,
she's been strangled.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.000
The poor wee thing. Let me see.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.920
We have to do something.
What can we do?

03:28.920 --> 03:32.440
She's gone, dead before she had
a chance to love.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.240
I'm awful, awful sorry.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.520
She'll be a little cherub in heaven
now for sure.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.360
I wish Mr Todd were here.

03:42.360 --> 03:43.800
I'm awful sorry.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.640
Shall I wake Mrs Glover?

03:49.680 --> 03:54.120
SHE SOBS

04:03.840 --> 04:06.240
It was snowing when Ursula died.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.920
It was snowing when Ursula was born.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.440
SHE GROANS

04:12.440 --> 04:14.680
And one more push, please, Mrs Todd.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.840
GROANS INTENSIFY

04:26.160 --> 04:27.880
Scissors.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.840
Scissors! Sewing scissors?

04:35.240 --> 04:37.320
BABY CRIES
Boy or girl?

04:38.800 --> 04:41.800
A bonny, bouncing baby girl.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.200
Sylvie thought Dr Fellows
might be over egging it

04:44.200 --> 04:45.480
with the alliteration.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.360
You were lucky I got here in time.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.320
Before the snow closed the roads,

04:49.320 --> 04:51.240
I called for Mrs Haddock,
the midwife,

04:51.240 --> 04:54.960
but I believe she's stuck somewhere
outside of Chalfont Saint Peter.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.080
Mrs Haddock?

04:57.080 --> 05:00.400
Yes, Mrs Haddock.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.160
Is that funny?

05:02.160 --> 05:04.160
No.

05:04.160 --> 05:07.280
So I thought I'd better
fight the elements.

05:07.280 --> 05:08.560
Lucky I did.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.360
She would have died from the cord
around her neck.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.240
Hello, little one.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.080
For God's sake, girl,
fetch some water and towels.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.880
Do you know nothing?
Were you raised in a field?

05:45.920 --> 05:48.760
Baby Ursula doesn't know
this is her second life...

05:50.280 --> 05:52.520
..but already she has an instinct.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.720
The world is a dangerous place.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.680
Oh, for goodness' sake.

06:04.680 --> 06:07.680
A farmer has been trampled
by a bull.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.760
His life hangs in the balance.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.040
You hold it in your hands.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.600
And they call it horsepower.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.840
Put your backs into it.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.640
That's what comes from relying
on new-fangled machines.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.080
There he is.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.320
My son, George, will take you.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.800
He'll get you there.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.160
You're not serious.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.160
Come on, sir.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.840
You, help me up.

06:40.840 --> 06:44.000
One, two, three.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.400
DOOR OPENS

06:49.400 --> 06:51.080
Here you are.

06:51.080 --> 06:54.000
Maurice, Pamela, come and say hello
to your new sister.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.520
Another girl.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.680
Name? I shall call her Ursula.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.360
It means little she-bear.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.240
I wish she was a bear.

07:08.560 --> 07:09.680
Uh!

07:11.360 --> 07:13.160
I hear the baby nearly died.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.360
When will Mr Todd be back?

07:18.360 --> 07:20.240
Oh, a snowdrop.

07:20.240 --> 07:24.240
The first flower to raise
its poor head above the ground.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.800
How brave it is.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.240
Sorry.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.840
Poppa's home!

08:17.840 --> 08:19.840
What's this sister of yours like,
any good?

08:19.840 --> 08:21.800
No. No?

08:21.800 --> 08:23.240
No?

08:26.560 --> 08:29.560
Well, well, well, how is everybody?

08:33.920 --> 08:36.640
Sorry I couldn't be here last night.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.080
Snow.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.400
Hello.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.520
Will you take Ursula to Bridget
for her bath? I'm going to rest.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.440
Ursula?

08:50.440 --> 08:51.840
Ursula.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.880
Ursula, hmm?

08:57.880 --> 08:59.440
Ursula Todd.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.720
Everything went all right?
Fingers and toes all correct?

09:17.720 --> 09:19.560
Mother and child doing well?

09:19.560 --> 09:22.040
You know she was born with
the cord wrapped around her neck?

09:23.800 --> 09:25.200
I didn't know.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.280
How are you, Mrs Glover?

09:33.280 --> 09:36.040
There's devilled kidneys
left over from breakfast.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.880
Can I tempt you?

09:37.880 --> 09:39.200
You cannot.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.160
BRIDGET COOS OVER URSULA

09:50.160 --> 09:52.080
God surely wanted you back.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.880
URSULA GARBLES
Uh-huh. He wanted you back.

09:56.480 --> 10:01.120
Ursula would learn the universe
was chaos and destruction.

10:01.120 --> 10:03.400
And she would love it anyway.

10:03.400 --> 10:07.760
There was something reassuring
about the way it repeated itself,

10:07.760 --> 10:11.040
something delicious
about her father's smell.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.960
She learned rabbits
were also delicious.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.360
The sun and spiders were gifts.

10:27.800 --> 10:28.960
Afternoon, ladies.

10:28.960 --> 10:32.800
Horses were immense and strange
and wonderful.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.440
Mrs Glover loved her son.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.640
Follow me!

10:40.640 --> 10:43.240
People her own size could be fun.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.920
Goo-goo-goo, stupid baby.

10:47.960 --> 10:52.240
And Maurice himself was chaos
and destruction.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.000
Maurice!
LOUD SLAP

11:05.000 --> 11:06.200
Ow!

11:16.040 --> 11:18.800
Like a hedgehog in hibernation.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.360
Poor old thing.

11:24.280 --> 11:29.280
Ursula entered her fifth summer
without further mishap.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.200
Ursula! Get away from that window.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.640
Come on,
let's go jump over the waves.

11:43.640 --> 11:47.240
It's not ours.
Come on, let's go paddle.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.320
SHE GASPS

12:10.040 --> 12:11.240
What?

12:11.240 --> 12:12.480
He's been burnt in a fire.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.520
Mr Rochester's been burnt in a fire.

12:14.520 --> 12:15.960
Can you believe it?

12:30.720 --> 12:32.080
Hold on.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.480
BABY CRIES

12:42.040 --> 12:43.920
Dear God, dear God!

12:45.800 --> 12:47.160
Getting hungry?

12:59.160 --> 13:00.800
Bridget, I'm going to feed Teddy,

13:00.800 --> 13:05.600
and then I should probably telephone
Hugh and see what time his train...

13:15.400 --> 13:17.280
BABY CRIES

13:26.840 --> 13:29.360
And so Ursula died.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.680
Scissors. Give me the scissors.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.560
Sewing scissors? What's happened?

13:37.680 --> 13:42.880
And yet she seems to have been given
the chance to live again.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.920
BABY CRIES

13:45.920 --> 13:49.560
The cord was wrapped around
her neck. She'll be all right.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.480
A bonny, bouncing baby girl.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.880
Come on, let's go paddle.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.040
Oh, dear!

15:02.040 --> 15:03.840
They went out a bit too far.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.360
But they'll be fine.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.680
Pammy, you were supposed
to be watching her. I was.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.560
What in the name of heaven's
gone on?

15:10.560 --> 15:11.920
Er, they went out a bit too far.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.440
Give me Teddy, take Ursula home
and get her dry.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.560
Don't cling so, Ursula,
you're all right.

15:16.560 --> 15:17.600
BABY BABBLES

15:18.640 --> 15:21.200
Come on. Why is there a wet man?

15:21.200 --> 15:23.320
Ursula nearly drowned.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.280
Idiot.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.960
How can we ever thank you?

15:26.960 --> 15:30.280
You must let us take you to tea
at some point.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.240
Ursula had heard Bridget
retell the harrowing story

15:40.240 --> 15:43.040
of her birth several times.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.080
"God had wanted her back",

15:45.080 --> 15:47.120
the Irish maid had told her.

15:49.960 --> 15:52.280
Come on, now.
You're too old for that.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.440
Daddy!

16:16.440 --> 16:18.320
Oh, hello, Little Bear.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.360
Did you have fun?

16:21.320 --> 16:23.720
There's a surprise
for you at home, guess.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.080
Better not be a dog.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.160
A dog. A dog! A puppy?

16:27.160 --> 16:28.600
We'll see. Let's go.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.000
Go, go, go, go, go.

16:31.680 --> 16:32.880
Glad to be back?

16:32.880 --> 16:34.280
Glad to have us back?

16:35.760 --> 16:37.040
WHISTLE

16:38.440 --> 16:39.960
Are we all ready?

16:39.960 --> 16:41.440
What does it do?

16:41.440 --> 16:43.160
Let there be...

16:44.240 --> 16:46.200
..light!

16:46.200 --> 16:47.960
You'll blow us all up!

16:47.960 --> 16:49.760
I don't like this at all.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.640
Who wants to try next?

16:54.880 --> 16:56.600
Yes, come on, Little Bear.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.200
I hear you survived
some very big waves,

16:59.200 --> 17:00.320
you're brave enough.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.480
She'll blow up.

17:02.640 --> 17:03.680
Oh!

17:03.680 --> 17:04.720
Wow!

17:07.920 --> 17:09.760
A dog would have been more useful.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.280
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.200
BABY GURGLES

17:21.920 --> 17:23.080
Shh, shh, shh.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.160
Best one yet.

17:28.160 --> 17:31.000
Yes. I think we should keep him.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.040
Hmm!

17:34.280 --> 17:38.920
Your holiday was jolly
and everything?

17:38.920 --> 17:40.760
Ursula should take swimming lessons.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.120
Clearly, she's not a natural.

17:42.120 --> 17:44.960
And she gets so anxious
about everything.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.760
I worry about her.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.000
She's fine.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.120
BONES CLICK

17:51.120 --> 17:52.480
SYLVIE SIGHS HEAVILY

17:52.480 --> 17:53.520
HUGH EXHALES

17:57.400 --> 17:58.920
This is marriage.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.760
Yes, this is marriage.

18:18.600 --> 18:19.720
DOOR CLOSES

19:02.280 --> 19:04.280
What's wrong?

19:04.280 --> 19:06.240
I keep dreaming that I'm drowning...

19:06.240 --> 19:07.320
Mm?

19:07.320 --> 19:08.440
..and I'm dead.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.960
You're not dead.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.160
It's a beautiful, sunny day.

19:14.160 --> 19:15.920
Go and run around outside.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.440
What if I fall and hit my head?

19:18.440 --> 19:19.680
What if I die?

19:22.480 --> 19:23.840
Ursula,

19:23.840 --> 19:27.720
you must avoid dark thoughts
at all costs, do you understand?

19:27.720 --> 19:29.920
When you think them, just...

19:29.920 --> 19:30.960
..shake your head.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.480
Hmm.

19:34.480 --> 19:37.200
Now, get some fresh air
and run around. Now.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.200
It was only in dreams
that life was frightening.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.640
The days were perfectly lovely.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.280
Some were more than that.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.200
Some were beautiful.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.640
Ursula resolved to enjoy life.

20:02.120 --> 20:05.400
There was so much life to enjoy.

20:05.400 --> 20:09.280
With the exception of Mrs Glover's
sandwiches, obviously.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.480
HORSE NEIGHS

20:48.080 --> 20:49.560
BRIDGET SCREAMS

20:49.560 --> 20:51.120
What's the matter with you, Bridget?

20:51.120 --> 20:52.400
A frog!

20:52.400 --> 20:53.680
MAURICE LAUGHS

20:53.680 --> 20:55.480
Maurice!

20:55.480 --> 20:56.960
What?!

20:56.960 --> 20:58.840
I'm going to feed the baby.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.200
BABY GURGLES

21:03.440 --> 21:04.480
EXHALES DEEPLY

21:10.040 --> 21:12.280
HORSE APPROACHES

21:13.320 --> 21:14.800
CROW CAWS

21:26.640 --> 21:29.720
SYLVIE SIGHS DEEPLY

21:31.760 --> 21:34.200
GASPING AND MOANING

21:47.080 --> 21:49.200
HUGH SIGHS HAPPILY

21:58.120 --> 22:00.560
You're very...

22:03.960 --> 22:05.360
..lively.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.520
Must be all that fresh air.

22:24.400 --> 22:27.040
Oh, it's going to be
a tremendous storm.

22:28.520 --> 22:30.280
I can feel it.

22:33.640 --> 22:35.280
THUNDER

22:41.040 --> 22:42.800
Doesn't he look handsome?

22:45.560 --> 22:47.040
Very.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.040
He was one of the first to sign up.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.520
War?!

23:06.520 --> 23:08.320
You're going to war?!

23:08.320 --> 23:11.920
I don't want to look back years
from now and know that I missed it,

23:11.920 --> 23:14.520
and I don't want to look back
and know that others

23:14.520 --> 23:17.720
stepped forward for their
country's honour and I did not.

23:20.120 --> 23:23.200
It's the only adventure
I might ever have.

23:23.200 --> 23:27.400
Adventure? And what about your
children? What about your wife?!

23:27.400 --> 23:29.280
It's for you that I'm doing this.

23:29.280 --> 23:33.240
To protect hearth and home -
to defend everything I believe in.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.520
And yet I heard the word adventure.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.880
DOOR SLAMS

23:40.880 --> 23:44.040
He's quite right, you know.
Shut up, Maurice!

23:48.040 --> 23:51.040
Her father seldom raised his voice.

23:51.040 --> 23:53.680
Something terrible
must have happened.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.040
But the night before he left,

23:56.040 --> 23:59.520
her father seemed to have made
everything all right again...

23:59.520 --> 24:01.280
Dance under the stars.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.040
..as he always did.

24:05.040 --> 24:08.520
Mm-hm-hm, hm-mm.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.280
What would it be like without him?

24:11.280 --> 24:13.520
Mm-hm-hm, hm-mm.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.040
Thank you.

24:16.520 --> 24:20.040
Mm-hm-hm, hm-mm, hm-mm.

24:22.240 --> 24:24.520
MAURICE IMITATES GUNSHOTS

24:33.200 --> 24:34.760
Maurice, stop!

24:38.040 --> 24:40.520
All right, stop walking,
stop walking.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.040
What a fine family I have.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.040
Fine, fine family.

25:08.760 --> 25:11.160
Don't be frightened. Not now.

25:26.280 --> 25:28.120
But he was frightened.

25:33.040 --> 25:36.640
Everyone spent an inordinate
amount of time knitting.

25:37.640 --> 25:40.040
It was the coldest winter on record

25:40.040 --> 25:43.280
and the soldiers on the front
were freezing.

25:49.320 --> 25:52.280
Sylvie hadn't heard from Hugh
in months.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.280
She didn't tell the children.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.360
She spent more money than usual
at Christmas.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.040
Merry Christmas.

26:17.520 --> 26:21.160
She told Ursula that the doll
was a present from Daddy.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.760
Let's see.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.840
Shall we be friends?

26:42.520 --> 26:44.760
Gertrude, come back!

26:44.760 --> 26:48.520
Just as Sylvie had hoped,
the creation of Chicken Corner

26:48.520 --> 26:51.040
was an excellent way
to distract her children

26:51.040 --> 26:53.040
from the newspaper headlines.

26:56.160 --> 27:00.360
Ursula wrote to Hugh,
describing the wonder of warm eggs.

27:02.040 --> 27:04.120
He didn't write back.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.280
But Sylvie explained,

27:07.280 --> 27:09.720
he was awfully busy.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.240
It's snowing!

27:15.040 --> 27:16.720
THEY LAUGH

27:29.280 --> 27:31.040
Get out of our room!

27:31.040 --> 27:32.840
"Get out of our room!"

27:32.840 --> 27:36.520
Maurice was home from boarding
school, recovering from chickenpox

27:36.520 --> 27:39.280
and making everyone's life
miserable.

27:39.280 --> 27:40.760
Get out!

27:42.760 --> 27:46.520
I'm going to your room now, and
there I shall destroy something!

27:51.960 --> 27:53.960
Neeeaaaow!

27:57.520 --> 28:00.760
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

28:27.520 --> 28:30.520
She would never have reached
for that odd little doll

28:30.520 --> 28:34.400
if Sylvie hadn't lied and told her
it was from her daddy.

29:02.680 --> 29:04.760
I hear the baby nearly died.

29:04.760 --> 29:08.160
And I must stay the rest of
the night on account of the snow.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.440
Neeeaaaow!

29:27.000 --> 29:28.320
Dsssssh!

29:32.120 --> 29:34.160
Come and get your tea!

29:34.160 --> 29:37.440
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

29:38.760 --> 29:42.040
Get back from that window, Ursula,
for the love of God!

29:42.040 --> 29:45.520
As for you, Maurice,
you're little more than a savage.

29:45.520 --> 29:48.040
I am a savage. I'm an Apache.

29:51.280 --> 29:55.080
This time around,
she trusted her instincts.

29:57.520 --> 30:01.040
She avoided water and windows...

30:01.040 --> 30:02.680
..and Maurice.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.280
..two, three, four.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.520
She missed her father.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.040
He'd been gone for so long.

30:21.040 --> 30:23.040
CHICKEN SQUAWKS

30:49.920 --> 30:52.040
EXPLOSIONS

30:57.040 --> 30:59.360
Ursula.
SHE GASPS

30:59.360 --> 31:01.760
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

31:10.760 --> 31:13.000
This isn't one
of our chickens, is it?

31:14.760 --> 31:16.520
No, darling, it isn't.

31:17.760 --> 31:19.840
Your father sends his love.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.520
How's the war?

31:22.520 --> 31:26.160
I have no idea. Your father
just talks about the weather.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.720
I miss Daddy.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.760
Me, too.

31:30.760 --> 31:32.760
Now eat your chicken.

31:33.760 --> 31:36.520
This is one of our chickens,
isn't it?

31:36.520 --> 31:38.040
It's Henrietta.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.520
Wishbone.

31:39.520 --> 31:43.360
Come on, let's make your dreams
come true. Not my dreams.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.760
I can't cut it. Here, silly.

31:49.760 --> 31:54.520
Baby Teddy was his mother's
favourite, but nobody minded.

31:54.520 --> 31:56.520
Everybody loved him.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.320
Even Maurice.

32:00.040 --> 32:03.040
On the morning of Teddy's
fourth birthday,

32:03.040 --> 32:06.040
the war to end all wars ended.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.280
I'm going to be a pilot. Neeeeaow!

32:11.280 --> 32:14.160
The family was crackling
with excitement.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.280
When would Hugh be home?

32:19.040 --> 32:22.520
Mrs Glover was delighted
to have her son home.

32:24.760 --> 32:28.680
Sadly, he'd lost the use of his legs
and his mind...

32:29.680 --> 32:34.760
..during a sneak attack on a German
trench 30 days before the ceasefire.

32:44.040 --> 32:48.040
Bridget had bought a new hat
to celebrate a new world.

32:53.920 --> 32:57.520
Her fiance, Clarence,
had also survived.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.760
He had written to her
from a field hospital

33:01.760 --> 33:05.040
to say she was under no obligation
to stick with him.

33:05.040 --> 33:08.280
She'd written back to say
she wasn't the sort

33:08.280 --> 33:10.520
to renege on a promise.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.080
Train's leaving soon.
Let's not miss it.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.520
Sure now you don't want to come
with us, Mrs Glover?

33:19.520 --> 33:21.600
I bet there'll be some
high jinks to be had.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.120
I'm avoiding crowds.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.760
My nephew dropped dead
of the influenza in the street.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.040
Not even in his own bed,
in the street.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.760
You mustn't be scared of
the influenza, Bridget.

33:30.760 --> 33:34.280
Four years of war, I think the
peace deserves a trip to London

33:34.280 --> 33:37.520
and a bit of a knees-up. He was
perfectly healthy at breakfast.

33:37.520 --> 33:40.120
Dead by noon. Who was? Her nephew.

33:40.120 --> 33:43.680
Life must go on.
Have a wonderful time, Bridget.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.520
Hasn't there been enough suffering?
Let's go.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.280
DOOR CLOSES

34:07.760 --> 34:09.760
Hi. We saw the King!

34:09.760 --> 34:11.760
No! Stop. The King.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.760
Right in front of us.

34:15.760 --> 34:17.520
She saw the King.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.520
There was a sea of people,

34:26.520 --> 34:29.320
everyone shouting themselves hoarse
for the King.

34:29.320 --> 34:32.760
"We want the King!
We want the King!"

34:32.760 --> 34:35.680
Who wants cocoa? Me. Me.
I got swept up.

34:35.680 --> 34:37.520
I lost my hat. Goodness.

34:37.520 --> 34:40.040
I think I'll say good night.
So soon?

34:40.040 --> 34:42.040
A bit of a headache.

34:43.760 --> 34:46.040
Goodnight. Bye. Bye.

34:47.280 --> 34:50.520
Come on, then, tell us everything.
Well...

35:00.200 --> 35:01.720
Thank you for coming.

35:01.720 --> 35:05.280
You suspect the influenza?
She was down in London yesterday?

35:05.280 --> 35:08.280
Yes, for the Armistice Day
celebrations. Crowds everywhere.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.520
Perfect conditions for the virus
to spread.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.120
Who feels unwell?

35:12.120 --> 35:14.280
Bridget and now Ursula.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.760
Get out, Pamela.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.040
Sh.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.040
ETHEREAL MUSIC

37:04.520 --> 37:06.280
DOOR CLOSES

37:18.040 --> 37:20.920
Did you have a nice time?
There was a sea of people.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.440
They were everywhere.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.360
Everybody was shouting, "We want
the King! We want the King!"

37:25.360 --> 37:28.280
Ursula was very curious to learn
whether or not Bridget

37:28.280 --> 37:30.280
had actually met the King.

37:32.040 --> 37:35.040
But instinct took her back to bed.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.760
Where's Bridget?
She says she feels ill.

38:00.760 --> 38:05.040
Hardly surprising. I dread to think
what time she staggered in.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.920
I really don't think Bridget is
well, Mrs Glover. Too much drink.

38:09.920 --> 38:12.520
I think we should call
Dr Fellows out. For Bridget?

38:12.520 --> 38:15.360
The girl's as healthy as a horse.
Dr Fellows will give you

38:15.360 --> 38:17.760
short shrift when he smells
the alcohol on her.

38:17.760 --> 38:20.720
Mrs Glover, I really do think
Bridget is ill.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.960
Can you see to the children?
I will telephone the doctor.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.440
Aren't the children going to school?

38:29.440 --> 38:31.360
Oh, yes, of course they are.

38:31.360 --> 38:33.280
Though perhaps not.

38:33.280 --> 38:35.280
No... Yes, they are.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.040
Or should they?

38:38.680 --> 38:42.040
I think keep them home for today.
Crowded school rooms and so on.

38:42.040 --> 38:44.280
But keep them down here just now.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.760
Handwriting, sums.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.200
Where's Teddy?

39:28.520 --> 39:30.120
Teddy?

39:45.040 --> 39:47.040
There's cake downstairs.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.280
Teddy!

40:13.280 --> 40:16.040
I thought I might make
Bridget feel better.

40:17.040 --> 40:20.040
I think Bridget is asleep
but her eyes are open.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.520
Get off the bed, Teddy.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.160
Dear God!

40:36.760 --> 40:38.520
Go to your room.

40:38.520 --> 40:41.040
No, go to Teddy's room.

40:41.040 --> 40:44.040
No, both of you go to my room.
Go now!

40:47.920 --> 40:49.760
Did you say cake?

41:08.240 --> 41:10.920
Teddy's skin is the same colour
as Bridget's.

41:10.920 --> 41:13.520
Heliotrope cyanosis.

41:13.520 --> 41:16.280
See those mahogany spots
on his cheeks?

41:17.760 --> 41:20.400
This is the more virulent strain,
I'm afraid.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.280
Stop it. Please, stop.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.520
Do not lecture me like a medical
student. I am their mother.

41:32.520 --> 41:33.960
And again.

41:38.760 --> 41:41.400
There must be something I can do.

41:41.400 --> 41:43.040
You can pray.

41:43.040 --> 41:44.520
Pray?

41:52.280 --> 41:56.280
Was there more Ursula could have
done to save him, she wondered?

42:00.960 --> 42:03.040
Sylvie did not believe in God

42:03.040 --> 42:06.560
but she prayed that night
with desperate conviction.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.280
And no faith.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.040
Teddy was gone by nightfall.

42:15.520 --> 42:18.040
Ursula knew the moment he had died.

42:19.760 --> 42:21.600
She felt it inside her.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.040
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

43:40.280 --> 43:43.040
There was a silly note
left on the door last night.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.920
Bridget was locked out.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.560
You know, it looks just like
your handwriting, Ursula.

43:48.560 --> 43:51.040
I don't suppose you can
explain that?

43:51.040 --> 43:53.040
No, I can't.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.520
I've sent Pamela
to fetch Bridget home.

43:58.520 --> 44:00.280
You sent Pamela?

44:00.280 --> 44:01.760
Yes, Pamela.

44:02.760 --> 44:04.840
Pamela's with Bridget?

44:04.840 --> 44:07.520
Yes. What's the matter with you?

44:12.760 --> 44:15.520
Ursula, you really are
such an anxious child.

44:15.520 --> 44:18.520
I'm starting to wonder if we
should take you to a doctor.

45:23.520 --> 45:25.040
Argh!

45:27.280 --> 45:29.040
Aargh.

45:31.280 --> 45:33.040
Aaaargh!

45:39.040 --> 45:42.520
All Ursula knew
was that she had to do it.

45:43.520 --> 45:46.040
She felt a surge of victory.

45:47.320 --> 45:48.840
I'm coming!

45:48.840 --> 45:50.520
Caught you.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.040
Got you.

45:54.040 --> 45:57.040
The world was indeed
a dangerous place.

45:57.040 --> 45:59.160
LAUGHTER

46:00.160 --> 46:03.040
But she was not powerless.

46:06.320 --> 46:08.440
Quite the opposite.

46:08.440 --> 46:11.040
Children, get in here now!

46:27.600 --> 46:29.160
Someone pushed me.

46:29.160 --> 46:30.720
Who?

46:35.760 --> 46:37.280
Teddy?

46:38.280 --> 46:40.040
Pamela? Me?

46:55.520 --> 46:59.040
It was beyond doubt, thought Sylvie.

47:01.040 --> 47:03.760
There was something wrong
with Ursula.

47:06.520 --> 47:08.520
SHE PANTS

47:21.840 --> 47:23.760
Hello, Little Bear.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.520
Teddy.

48:13.520 --> 48:15.760
Teddy, it's all right.

48:15.760 --> 48:17.880
It's Daddy.

48:17.880 --> 48:20.200
This is Daddy.

48:22.040 --> 48:24.400
Hello... Hello, little man.

48:32.760 --> 48:34.800
Can I give you a hug?

48:46.640 --> 48:49.040
We have chickens.
THEY LAUGH

48:56.280 --> 48:58.760
Teddy was her mother's favourite.

48:58.760 --> 49:01.040
But she was her father's.

49:01.040 --> 49:03.280
She'd forgotten that.

49:04.520 --> 49:07.520
She had also forgotten
the smell of him

49:07.520 --> 49:10.280
and the way she felt in his arms.

49:11.760 --> 49:15.040
This was love, thought Ursula.

49:16.520 --> 49:19.040
It would be worth dying for.

49:21.040 --> 49:24.280
Don't you wonder sometimes,
if just one small thing

49:24.280 --> 49:28.200
had been changed in the past,
surely things would be different.

49:28.200 --> 49:31.040
I keep thinking I'll wake up
and it was all a dream.

49:31.040 --> 49:33.760
That we're not trapped
in this endless nightmare.

49:33.760 --> 49:37.000
Oh, chin up. It won't last forever.
Nothing does.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.960
I wish I could go instead of you.

49:40.960 --> 49:43.280
I really do. It isn't fair.

50:08.760 --> 50:11.720
This is me.
You should leave me here.

50:23.760 --> 50:25.760
Be as safe as you can.

50:27.520 --> 50:29.040
Will do.

50:30.280 --> 50:32.120
Fly very carefully.

50:34.040 --> 50:35.840
Try not to die.

50:35.840 --> 50:37.520
Do my best.

50:48.520 --> 50:50.040
Teddy!

50:54.040 --> 50:57.120
# Oooo-ooooh

50:57.120 --> 51:02.520
# Again
Ooooo-ooooh

51:02.520 --> 51:10.040
# This couldn't happen again
Ooo-ooh, ooo-oh, ooooh

51:10.040 --> 51:17.040
# This is that once in a lifetime

51:18.040 --> 51:23.040
# This is the thrill divine

51:23.040 --> 51:28.520
# Ooo-ooh, ooo-oh, ooo-oooh

51:28.520 --> 51:33.040
# What's more

51:34.040 --> 51:39.040
# This never happened before... #
