[Park Tae-seo disguised himself
as an abscess specialist?]

00:34.700 --> 00:35.900
Are you sure?

00:37.670 --> 00:40.940
The abscess specialist I saw that night
had a scar on his wrist.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.140
That same scar...

00:44.170 --> 00:46.070
was on Park Tae-seo's wrist.

00:52.750 --> 00:55.820
So it is true that Park Seung was involved

00:56.790 --> 00:58.420
in the death of the Crown Prince.

00:59.720 --> 01:00.960
But why?

01:03.090 --> 01:05.960
Why on earth
would he do such a horrible thing?

01:13.600 --> 01:16.000
Park Tae-seo had this Pharmacy Journal
in his possession.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.640
It contains records of everything

01:18.770 --> 01:20.310
that happened in the Medicines Department.

01:20.539 --> 01:24.450
However, this is merely a written record.

01:24.780 --> 01:27.620
Nothing in this
directly mentions Park Seung.

01:28.750 --> 01:32.289
We cannot prove that he killed
the Crown Prince with this alone.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.729
Especially now that
the abscess specialist is dead.

01:41.430 --> 01:44.330
If this was a mere Pharmacy Journal,

01:44.900 --> 01:47.700
why do you think Park Tae-seo
went all the way to Jinin Temple

01:47.970 --> 01:50.110
and tried to get his hands on this
while on the run?

01:53.340 --> 01:54.640

01:55.410 --> 01:57.780
Park Seung used his illegitimate son,
Park Tae-seo,

01:58.110 --> 02:00.120
to steal tax grains
from Chungcheong Province.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.920
On top of that, he colluded
with government officials there

02:02.980 --> 02:04.850
to gain illegal profit.

02:05.490 --> 02:08.460
He murdered the secret royal inspectors
sent to the province without hesitation

02:09.190 --> 02:11.960
and seized or blocked
all reports from the region.

02:12.730 --> 02:15.830
This could not have been possible without
help from someone within the Palace.

02:19.630 --> 02:22.600
In return
for assassinating the Crown Prince,

02:24.270 --> 02:25.440
Park Seung received

02:26.440 --> 02:27.980
Chungcheong Province from someone.

02:30.510 --> 02:32.980

03:13.590 --> 03:16.960
I am certain that there is something
in this Pharmacy Journal.

03:17.860 --> 03:20.130
We must prove that
Park Seung is connected to all of this

03:20.500 --> 03:22.500
during the interrogation.

03:23.030 --> 03:25.200
Your speculation is certainly reasonable.

03:26.030 --> 03:28.440
But this is a grave issue,
so we cannot act solely based on that.

03:29.740 --> 03:31.570
If we make a mistake,

03:31.910 --> 03:33.610
we could get hurt.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.280
We must investigate properly.

03:35.810 --> 03:37.150
It is too dangerous.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.280
Especially if the person
we are thinking of

is behind Park Seung.

we shall not bring up the Crown Prince

03:49.590 --> 03:51.790
I understand that you wish
to get to the root of this promptly.

03:51.860 --> 03:55.460
However, we must focus
on getting Park Seung first.

03:55.530 --> 03:58.400
We must strip him of his power first.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.440
Then we shall move on to the next step.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.400
That is our only chance.

the most realistic option that we have.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.150
With all due respect,

04:48.550 --> 04:50.450
this will be the last time I accept this.

04:52.150 --> 04:53.420
What do you mean?

04:53.990 --> 04:57.030
The donor has no intention
of stopping the donations.

04:57.530 --> 04:58.690
I am aware.

04:58.760 --> 05:01.100
If the amount is not enough,

05:01.600 --> 05:03.300
I can let the donor know.

05:04.270 --> 05:06.330
Thanks to the generous donations,

05:06.730 --> 05:10.410
we could settle on Tail Island
when we had nowhere to go.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.640
Thanks to the support we received,

05:12.710 --> 05:15.110
we found the courage to survive.

05:15.180 --> 05:16.980
And now,

05:17.050 --> 05:18.610
we raise crops and cattle on our own.

05:19.010 --> 05:21.220
We earn enough money to be independent,

05:21.680 --> 05:23.420
but that is not the problem.

05:28.360 --> 05:31.260
Most of us here were either banished,
have no parents,

05:31.430 --> 05:33.030
or are fugitives.

05:33.090 --> 05:36.360
Hence, we are not acknowledged
as citizens of Joseon.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.600
Our names are not on the family register,

05:39.670 --> 05:41.900
so even when we fall ill
and visit a physician,

05:41.970 --> 05:44.040
we get turned away most of the time.

05:45.370 --> 05:47.540
Even if we offer to pay a lot more
than the normal price,

05:47.810 --> 05:50.140
it is very difficult
for us to purchase medicine.

05:51.110 --> 05:54.880
But most importantly,
the officials could raid us

05:55.380 --> 05:57.420
and disband the village at any time,

05:58.350 --> 06:01.090
so we are living in fear,

06:04.160 --> 06:07.530
which is why we are preparing to leave.

06:07.860 --> 06:08.930
You plan to leave?

06:09.000 --> 06:13.200
I heard there are many other countries
in this world.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.240
I have seen ships from foreign countries

06:16.300 --> 06:18.510
dock in Ganghwa Island.

06:19.870 --> 06:23.040
As soon as we have enough money
to board one of those foreign ships,

06:23.380 --> 06:25.280
I will take the women and children

06:25.650 --> 06:27.450
and leave Joseon.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.580
Must you do that?

06:29.780 --> 06:31.290
Now with that said,

before I leave.

06:42.030 --> 06:43.800

and people in the guild.

08:52.530 --> 08:54.260

08:54.330 --> 08:56.230

08:56.300 --> 08:58.830
and trade goods
that Kang Han-ki had obtained illegally.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.300
However,

09:03.770 --> 09:06.840
they seemed to know nothing
about the weapons or gunpowder.

that mentions us.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.870
-Of course. Get me the doenjang.
-Yes, sir.

15:14.110 --> 15:15.940
But who are you to order me around?

15:17.110 --> 15:18.350
-Salt.
-Yes, sir.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.980
Tell me, who are you to give me orders?

15:26.750 --> 15:28.520
-Is it seasoned?
-Who on earth are you...

15:33.490 --> 15:35.300
It is salty. Salty, you hear me?

15:35.360 --> 15:37.230
No, it is not!

15:39.570 --> 15:40.670
It is!

15:41.370 --> 15:42.500
What do I do?

15:42.700 --> 15:44.140
I added all the meat in.

15:44.870 --> 15:46.710
But our lord loathes salty food.

15:46.840 --> 15:47.880
You little!

15:54.050 --> 15:55.720
Then let us eat it.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.050
Let us do that.

15:57.150 --> 15:59.020
-I usually eat my food salty.
-Me too.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.860
-Salty food is the best.
-And you get to eat lots of rice.

16:08.030 --> 16:09.430
You really know how to eat.

16:23.580 --> 16:24.780
We are not buying.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.780
Go try next door.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.220
You are right.
Our next-door neighbor is much richer.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.590
-Our lord is very stingy.
-Right.

16:32.650 --> 16:33.790
Turn back and go.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.060
I see.

16:38.090 --> 16:40.390
Is your lord that stingy?

16:40.960 --> 16:43.500
Is that why you are having
meat as a side dish?

16:46.800 --> 16:48.570
My lord, when did you come back home?

16:48.640 --> 16:51.570
Some earn money, and others spend it.

16:51.740 --> 16:56.240
You see, we were making food
for our hard-working lord,

16:56.440 --> 16:58.350
but the seasoning turned out too salty.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.080
How is your work going?

17:01.350 --> 17:04.619
Well, it is obvious he must be doing
an excellent job. Do you not agree?

17:04.690 --> 17:07.760
He even put Park Tae-seo behind bars.
Does that not say it all?

17:07.819 --> 17:08.890
It does.

17:08.960 --> 17:12.490
Anyway, hand me the gunpowder sales ledger
you received at the hideout place.

17:12.829 --> 17:15.329
Should you not
have given it to me right away?

17:15.560 --> 17:16.660
I did not receive anything.

17:18.099 --> 17:19.200
What do you mean?

17:19.670 --> 17:21.640
It is the gunpowder sales ledger
from the hideout place.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.670
My lord, Jo-yi has it.

17:26.069 --> 17:27.940
She still has it?

17:28.740 --> 17:29.780
Yes.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.420
Did you say she was at Ojang-dong?

17:37.020 --> 17:38.190
Are you going to visit?

17:38.590 --> 17:40.190
But Gwang-soon is there too.

17:40.390 --> 17:41.960
You are not going
to go empty-handed, right?

17:42.060 --> 17:44.120
We do not have time. Now lead the way.

17:50.860 --> 17:51.930
There she is.

17:57.770 --> 17:58.870
My lord.

18:02.210 --> 18:03.910
Why do you look so pale?

18:05.950 --> 18:08.850
My lord, I am sorry.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.250
[Gunpowder Sales]

18:10.080 --> 18:11.750
I should have given it to you earlier,

18:12.220 --> 18:13.950
but I made the wrong decision.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.860
Though I cannot tell you the reason,

18:17.090 --> 18:18.990
I tried to burn this ledger.

18:19.130 --> 18:21.030
I am really sorry.

18:23.700 --> 18:24.870
Do not be.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.740
It is the perfect timing if I take it now.
So do not worry.

18:31.940 --> 18:32.940
My lord.

18:34.110 --> 18:35.480
Whatever the truth may be,

18:37.610 --> 18:39.380
please investigate it thoroughly.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.450
I want to know the absolute answer.

18:43.980 --> 18:46.590
All right, I will try my best.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.800
Have you had lunch?

18:59.200 --> 19:00.400
Do not mind me.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.270
I need to use those up.

19:11.180 --> 19:13.280
Yuk-chil, Goo-pal.

19:13.350 --> 19:14.480
-Yes?
-Get them ready.

19:14.550 --> 19:15.650
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

19:17.580 --> 19:19.820
-Have you found it?
-Not yet.

19:46.610 --> 19:48.250
What is it?

20:09.400 --> 20:11.100
What...

20:11.770 --> 20:13.770
That you should not do.

20:33.760 --> 20:34.800
Lord Yi-eon.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.260
Silly you.

20:44.470 --> 20:46.170
No, wait!

20:47.070 --> 20:49.840
You once said you wanted to try
the jjaggeuli served at Bo-ri's.

20:51.010 --> 20:53.880
-That I did.
-It turns out that I am the one

20:53.950 --> 20:56.080
who taught her the recipe.

20:57.480 --> 20:58.550
Is that true?

20:59.390 --> 21:01.760
Do you perhaps have a mortar at home?

21:04.730 --> 21:06.760
This is supposed to be a man's job.

21:06.930 --> 21:08.000
Allow me to do it.

21:10.530 --> 21:13.200
Do you not remember who saved us

21:13.630 --> 21:14.940
from the bandits?

21:20.740 --> 21:23.210
Please sit and wait.
It will not take long.

21:29.950 --> 21:30.950
Ta-da.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.450
This is the seasoning
that makes Bo-ri's jjaggeuli so special.

21:34.520 --> 21:35.620
In just 50 ri from here,

21:35.690 --> 21:36.620
there is Chungcheong Province's
most famous diner,

21:36.690 --> 21:37.720
Bo-ri's Jjaggeuli.

21:37.790 --> 21:39.790
I heard they use a special seasoning
made with dried chili powder

21:39.860 --> 21:41.460
to make their famous broth.
Do you not want to taste it?

21:41.530 --> 21:43.160
Being able to have
Bo-ri's jjaggeuli in Hanyang?

21:43.230 --> 21:44.770
How spectacular.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.770
Are you that excited about it?

21:47.770 --> 21:50.440
I would like to learn the recipe.

21:52.840 --> 21:53.910
No!

21:58.610 --> 22:01.550
I may want to open up
a jjaggeuli diner down the road.

22:07.490 --> 22:08.560
Please teach me the recipe.

22:12.060 --> 22:15.460
You cannot expect to learn
a trade secret by just asking.

22:15.630 --> 22:16.830
No way.

22:18.100 --> 22:19.570
If the recipe must be kept a secret,

22:20.270 --> 22:23.240
then you will have to come by every day
and make it for me.

22:27.640 --> 22:28.710
Pardon?

22:28.780 --> 22:30.540
I would love nothing more
than to be greeted by you

22:30.610 --> 22:31.910
when I come home from work.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.620
Such unique flavors.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.030
The combination is something
I have never had before,

23:19.390 --> 23:23.230
but you cannot help but crave more
after the first bite.

23:24.260 --> 23:27.200
How did you come by such recipes?

23:30.240 --> 23:31.300
I had a friend

23:32.140 --> 23:34.840
who had the pickiest palate.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.240
He was picky to the point

23:37.580 --> 23:39.710
where even 12 side dishes weren't enough.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.020
You should go ahead as well.

23:46.620 --> 23:47.720
Sure.

24:03.770 --> 24:07.070
The flavors are clean, light,
but also quite rich.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.110
How did you think of such a unique recipe?

24:13.580 --> 24:16.950
It is the dish my mother used to
often make in my childhood years.

24:18.390 --> 24:20.790
She had the fairest hands.

24:21.820 --> 24:22.820
But then...

24:37.740 --> 24:40.210
Please enjoy it
by mixing rice into the broth.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.780
One needs to be on a full stomach
to do great things.

24:44.180 --> 24:46.350
Of course. You should eat up as well.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.250
An empty stomach
will make you feel empty inside.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.950
Enjoying a meal is a way to be happy.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.810
Store the gunpowder
at the shed in the woods

25:13.640 --> 25:15.480
and bury the rifles at the beach.

25:15.540 --> 25:18.110
Only keep the essential ledgers
and burn the rest.

25:18.180 --> 25:19.180
Yes, ma'am.

25:34.130 --> 25:36.700
What if they raid our place as well?

25:36.830 --> 25:38.170
What do we do?

25:38.230 --> 25:39.870
Enough with the hasty remarks.

25:40.230 --> 25:43.200
Cook food with the other ladies
and act like everything is normal.

25:43.440 --> 25:47.110
I will do what I can
to secure Tail Island no matter what.

26:15.870 --> 26:18.540
Repeat what you told me earlier.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.610
I will help you get on a boat
bound for the West.

26:18.970 --> 26:22.740
[Yiyangseon: a boat or ferry
headed to a western country]

26:21.580 --> 26:25.110
You will need to pay more than the fare
to get on one.

26:38.590 --> 26:39.630
Gosh.

26:40.330 --> 26:43.360
Lord Yi-eon, over there
in the western sky,

26:43.800 --> 26:45.500
do you see the Seven Sisters?

26:45.930 --> 26:49.370
Right, the Seven Sisters.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.470
Are you referring to those?

26:53.010 --> 26:56.540
What you are pointing at
is the northern sky

26:56.740 --> 26:57.910
and that is the Little Dipper.

26:59.510 --> 27:01.280
So that way is north.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.980
Over there.

27:06.420 --> 27:08.360
Right, those stars over there.

27:09.090 --> 27:10.960
No, that is the Cassiopeia.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.730
The Cassiopeia? I see.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.160
Over there.

27:18.900 --> 27:21.430
Oh, I see. It is that one.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.700
Goodness, that is Venus!

27:24.970 --> 27:27.710
Venus?

27:29.740 --> 27:32.050
Were you referring
to that star over there?

27:32.110 --> 27:33.780
Which one?

27:33.910 --> 27:36.420
The one next to Venus.

27:37.250 --> 27:39.350
Which star are you talking about?

27:39.420 --> 27:40.550
Can you not see it?

27:40.620 --> 27:43.090
That is the moon, Lord Yi-eon.

27:44.560 --> 27:47.560
Tie the offenders to the rack
and interrogate them.

27:52.470 --> 27:55.070
Please call for the Chief State Councilor.

27:55.170 --> 27:57.340
I am his one and only son.

27:57.900 --> 28:00.770
Let me talk to him at least.

28:01.410 --> 28:03.680
Please let me talk to
the Chief State Councilor.

28:03.740 --> 28:05.150
Remove the sack from their heads.

28:12.920 --> 28:15.360
Please call for the Chief State Councilor.

28:19.260 --> 28:22.400
-It is him.
-Your Majesty!

28:22.460 --> 28:24.630
Your Majesty!

28:24.900 --> 28:26.500
Your Majesty!

28:27.470 --> 28:30.200
Such insolence!
How dare you lift your chin up.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.780
Where is Park Seung?

28:40.680 --> 28:43.120
-Director.
-Yes, Your Majesty?

28:43.180 --> 28:45.690
Should there not be a female offender?

28:48.190 --> 28:49.660
My apologies, Your Majesty.

28:50.160 --> 28:53.690
Gokdu Guild on Ganghwa Island
was thoroughly searched,

28:54.490 --> 28:56.800
but Kang Han-ki was nowhere to be found.

28:57.130 --> 29:00.470
So a setback occurred because
you were not able to arrest a woman?

29:03.200 --> 29:04.500
Begin the interrogation.

29:15.150 --> 29:19.190
Park Tae-seo, Cha Mal-jong,
Ji Maeng-soo, and Park Do-soo.

29:19.890 --> 29:21.550
Larceny and robbery by assault,

kidnapping and human trafficking,

29:23.420 --> 29:25.460
stealing from the palace
by plundering offerings

29:25.530 --> 29:27.190
as well as tax grain.

29:27.260 --> 29:28.760
They violated moral principles

29:28.830 --> 29:30.660
and even committed murder in the process.

29:30.730 --> 29:32.900
I humbly announce their arrest.

29:31.200 --> 29:34.030
[Jeongbeom: perpetrators]

29:36.570 --> 29:39.070

[Gongcho: making a statement
about the crime one committed]

29:51.380 --> 29:53.420

tortured and interrogated first.

29:52.450 --> 29:56.020
[Hyeongmun:
Interrogation accompanied by torture]

My lord.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.230
Your Majesty, I did not...

30:06.670 --> 30:08.900
-Beat him 30 times.
-Yes, sir.

30:10.670 --> 30:11.910
I am truly sorry!

30:11.970 --> 30:15.240
I am sorry! Please forgive me!

30:15.310 --> 30:17.280
Please spare me.

30:17.540 --> 30:19.050
What did you do wrong?

30:19.410 --> 30:21.450
You had better confess in detail.

30:21.850 --> 30:26.150
Well, I... I stole precious tributes
meant for His Majesty the King.

30:26.820 --> 30:29.890
I committed high treason.

30:30.290 --> 30:33.130
By "high treason", do you mean
that you bribed Chungcheong officials

30:33.290 --> 30:35.060
as the head of Soyang Guild,

30:35.260 --> 30:38.330
abducted and abused commoners
to turn them into slaves,

30:38.870 --> 30:41.070
murdered the secret royal inspectors
sent to the province,

30:42.770 --> 30:45.770
illegally mined silver with Park Tae-seo,

30:45.870 --> 30:47.640
and hired bandits to steal things?

30:48.640 --> 30:50.210
Are you confessing to such grave crimes?

30:50.310 --> 30:51.310
Pardon?

30:51.540 --> 30:53.550
No! That is not true!

30:53.610 --> 30:57.550
I know nothing about such things.

30:57.880 --> 31:01.990
All I did was covet wealth
and spend lavishly.

31:02.090 --> 31:04.890
How dare you lie
when there is clear proof?

31:05.630 --> 31:06.690
Beat him.

31:07.730 --> 31:08.730
No...

31:09.330 --> 31:10.400
Stay still!

31:12.600 --> 31:15.640
Please spare me!

31:19.470 --> 31:22.610
I was born into a so-called noble family
that had nothing.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.080
They called themselves nobles,

31:25.610 --> 31:28.480
and I was banished
for being an illegitimate son.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.550
Then I met and befriended people
in a similar situation

31:31.620 --> 31:33.390
and tried to make a living

31:33.920 --> 31:36.960
by doing such misdeeds.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.590
Beat him!

31:42.460 --> 31:44.560
But everything I did...

31:48.170 --> 31:49.400
Tae-seo...

31:51.270 --> 31:53.240
He made me do it!

31:59.680 --> 32:02.520
And that scoundrel, Park Do-soo,

32:03.820 --> 32:06.890
killed Hong Seok-ki,
the chief clerk of marine transportation!

32:10.460 --> 32:11.790
How dare you!

32:12.590 --> 32:15.460
How dare you slander me, you lowborn fool!

32:16.560 --> 32:18.430
Your Majesty!

32:18.600 --> 32:19.800
It is not true.

32:19.970 --> 32:22.000
I met these scoundrels
for the first time today.

32:22.070 --> 32:24.970
And I only now realized
that they committed

32:25.240 --> 32:26.540
such grave crimes!

32:26.610 --> 32:27.810
Silence!

32:27.870 --> 32:30.740
I wish to speak
to the Chief State Councilor!

Your Majesty!

32:34.450 --> 32:37.780
I swear, I am innocent!

32:41.150 --> 32:42.360
Park Do-soo.

32:42.860 --> 32:46.030
Is it true that
you killed Chief Clerk Hong Seok-ki?

32:47.330 --> 32:48.930
No, I did not.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.030
I did not kill him.

32:52.770 --> 32:54.130
Bring in the witness!

Park Do-soo kill the chief clerk

33:18.590 --> 33:19.830
of marine transportation.

33:21.260 --> 33:24.000
No! She is lying!

33:24.560 --> 33:26.830
Also, he abducted me,
held me against my will,

33:26.900 --> 33:29.140
and took me to Park Tae-seo's hideout.

33:29.270 --> 33:32.940
So he and Park Tae-seo were in contact?

33:33.540 --> 33:36.310
Your Majesty! Do not believe her.

33:36.580 --> 33:39.780
It is true that Tae-seo is
my father's child born out of wedlock,

33:39.850 --> 33:41.150
but he ran away from home at age 15,

33:41.210 --> 33:43.950
and I did not even know
whether or not he was alive.

33:44.680 --> 33:48.760
Please believe me!
I was not in contact with Tae-seo.

33:50.420 --> 33:53.530
The day I saw them,
Park Do-soo, Park Tae-seo,

33:53.590 --> 33:55.290
and Cha Mal-jong were together.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.730
And when I was a slave in Soyang Guild,

33:57.860 --> 34:00.270
I saw Park Tae-seo and Ji Maeng-soo
visiting the guild

34:00.500 --> 34:01.700
many times.

34:05.170 --> 34:06.610
There you go. That is the truth,

-Lads!
-Prepare the knee compressor.

34:14.480 --> 34:18.150
No! I will confess.
I will tell you everything.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.030

to see Tae-seo.

the mastermind behind everything.

It is not right to release him like this.

And to make him the presiding judge?

35:36.630 --> 35:38.300
Does any of the evidence you have gathered

35:39.070 --> 35:41.370
mention his name?

Although his name is not mentioned,

35:47.940 --> 35:49.910
I am certain
that we can prove his involvement

35:50.010 --> 35:51.980
if we go through
and compare all the ledgers.

35:52.380 --> 35:54.250
So there is no solid proof,

and punish the Chief State Councilor?

with all the details.

51:03.790 --> 51:06.460
[Left Chungcheong Province]

51:08.560 --> 51:10.930
[Left Chungcheong Province]

51:14.200 --> 51:18.370
[Left Chungcheong Province]

51:22.540 --> 51:25.840
From the very beginning,
I knew what would happen.

51:26.750 --> 51:28.310
So here is an idea.

51:30.580 --> 51:34.050
How about you
take the blame for everything

51:34.490 --> 51:37.820
and let the secret royal inspector
wipe you off the face of this earth?

51:48.570 --> 51:49.700
I knew...

51:51.170 --> 51:53.870
that you would act as predicted.

52:06.320 --> 52:09.290
Losers always blame the stone
that they trip over.

52:10.860 --> 52:12.060
[Dad!]

52:13.790 --> 52:16.630
Do-soo, your dad is right here.

52:22.270 --> 52:24.440
Goodness, Do-soo.

53:00.470 --> 53:04.480
[Are you making me answer for the crimes
you believe to be true?]

53:06.310 --> 53:09.080
[I did not run away or go into hiding.]

53:10.550 --> 53:12.380
[I am right here before your very eyes.]

53:17.890 --> 53:19.520
[Back then and even now,]

53:19.590 --> 53:22.690
you are the one
who was not able to arrest or stop me.

53:40.310 --> 53:43.780
They are the perpetrators.

53:47.950 --> 53:52.160
It goes by the law to execute by beheading
only after the first trial.

53:52.460 --> 53:54.730
But due to the heinous nature
of their crimes

53:55.090 --> 53:56.460
and them being a flight risk,

53:56.900 --> 53:59.330
they have been sentenced
to an immediate beheading.

54:01.770 --> 54:05.370
It is time for some fun!

54:16.980 --> 54:18.250
[They hereby answer
for their heinous crimes.]

54:42.570 --> 54:44.040
Guard the perimeter!

54:53.990 --> 54:55.220
Order them to step back.

54:56.020 --> 54:57.520
Whether you kill me or not
changes nothing.

54:57.990 --> 54:59.790
The death penalty
will still hang over your head.

55:01.230 --> 55:03.330
There is no scenario
in which you make it out alive.

55:04.500 --> 55:06.900
Tae-seo, kill him.

55:17.180 --> 55:19.180
[They hereby answer
for their heinous crimes.]

55:21.510 --> 55:22.580
Enough.

55:26.320 --> 55:27.790
Put them down.

55:27.990 --> 55:29.790
They must not escape from here.

55:33.390 --> 55:34.530
What are you waiting for?

55:35.060 --> 55:38.030
You are not to disobey
an execution order from His Majesty.

55:44.400 --> 55:46.040
[They hereby answer
for their heinous crimes.]

55:46.100 --> 55:47.010
[They hereby answer
for their heinous crimes.]

55:51.840 --> 55:53.480
My lord, are you all right?

55:54.710 --> 55:55.980
Do not let them live.

55:57.950 --> 55:59.320
Do not let them live!

55:59.380 --> 56:01.050
Go after them!

58:02.310 --> 58:04.440
[We thank Jo Kwan-woo
for his special appearance.]

58:04.640 --> 58:07.250
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

58:08.050 --> 58:09.780
[So what if it fails?]

58:09.980 --> 58:11.950
[So what if things take a wrong turn?]

58:12.220 --> 58:13.520
[Whatever.]

58:14.220 --> 58:16.620
[Dad, I am terrified.]

58:16.790 --> 58:20.330
[They will first suspect that Leader Kang
orchestrated the prisoner escape.]

58:20.490 --> 58:21.560
Mother...

58:21.760 --> 58:23.090
What is the meaning of this?

58:23.430 --> 58:24.730
Bow down to me!

58:25.000 --> 58:26.630
[One makes the stew]

58:26.830 --> 58:28.770
[while the other enjoys it.]

58:29.000 --> 58:31.500
[I am sure you will get back
on your feet.]

58:31.600 --> 58:35.110
[Jo-yi, to not disappoint you,
I will get back on my feet.]
