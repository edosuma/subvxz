ANNOUNCER:
 <i>Last week on</i> Taxi:

01:13.133 --> 01:14.801
Yeah, you might
say that, Louie.

01:14.834 --> 01:17.567
You know, the cabs, they been
falling apart lately,

01:17.601 --> 01:20.067
and Tony's brakes--
they just went out on him.

01:20.100 --> 01:22.400
I mean, every time
we go out of here,
our lives are in danger,

01:22.434 --> 01:24.501
and we think
it's about time you
do something about it.

01:24.534 --> 01:26.467
Go blow-dry your face.

01:26.501 --> 01:28.000
What are you...?

01:28.033 --> 01:28.968
Hey! Hey!

01:32.634 --> 01:35.334
Nardo's your new
shop steward, huh?

01:35.367 --> 01:37.000
Wise choice.

01:37.033 --> 01:38.467
( <i>snickering</i> )

01:38.501 --> 01:40.901
And I also said
that we're on strike.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.501
( <i>chanting</i> ):
Shut it down! Shut it down!

01:44.534 --> 01:45.968
Shut it down!

01:46.000 --> 01:47.634
Shut it down!

01:47.667 --> 01:50.334
One date to save
cabbies' lives.

01:52.834 --> 01:55.634
You'd give in
to all of our demands...

01:55.667 --> 01:58.100
if I go on one date with you?

01:58.133 --> 02:01.534
You're taking advantage
of something that's
really decent in me

02:01.567 --> 02:03.834
to satisfy some
indecent needs
of your own.

02:03.868 --> 02:05.367
How does that
make you feel?

02:05.400 --> 02:08.467
Horny as all get-out.

02:12.501 --> 02:15.100
( <i>whistling</i> )

02:21.100 --> 02:22.367
Well, welcome back, boys.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.934
Don't get your
hopes up, Louie.

02:23.968 --> 02:25.501
These negotiations
fall through

02:25.534 --> 02:26.701
between you and Elaine,

02:26.734 --> 02:28.834
we're going right back
to the picket line.

02:28.868 --> 02:31.667
Oh, they're not going to
fall through, Wheeler. Uh-uh.

02:31.701 --> 02:33.767
By the way, what
concessions
did you make?

02:33.801 --> 02:37.767
I'm not allowed to discuss that
until after the negotiations.

02:37.801 --> 02:40.834
Haven't you ever heard
of the Taft-Hartley Act?

02:40.868 --> 02:45.167
Hey, I used to see them
on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

02:45.200 --> 02:47.767
Taft was the goofy one,
right?

02:51.100 --> 02:54.133
( <i>humming</i> )

02:56.000 --> 02:57.834
* That's why the lady 

02:57.868 --> 02:59.634
* That's why the lady 

02:59.667 --> 03:00.868
* That's why the lady 

03:00.901 --> 03:02.834
* Is a tramp,
tramp, tramp, tramp... *

03:02.868 --> 03:05.234
You know,
there's something weird here?

03:05.267 --> 03:06.767
Yesterday, we were

03:06.801 --> 03:08.300
at a total impasse.

03:08.334 --> 03:10.067
Today, everything's fine.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.834
Hey, Alex, listen. Elaine
says everything's going fine,

03:12.868 --> 03:14.367
and we just have
to trust her.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.801
By the way,
where <i>is</i> Elaine tonight?

03:16.834 --> 03:19.067
She sad she was going
to take the night
off to rest.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.601
Yeah. You know,
I think the pressure
of being shop steward

03:21.634 --> 03:22.901
is finally
getting to Elaine.

03:22.934 --> 03:25.133
Why do you say that?

03:25.167 --> 03:27.267
You know how, like,
when she gets nervous,

03:27.300 --> 03:28.801
she starts
biting fingernails?

03:28.834 --> 03:30.601
Well, today,
she started in on mine.

03:30.634 --> 03:32.000
Hey, uh... guys.

03:32.033 --> 03:35.501
I need your opinion here
on which is the best aftershave.

03:35.534 --> 03:37.234
Oh, Louie.

03:37.267 --> 03:39.601
Okeydoke.

03:41.634 --> 03:43.367
The best-smelling.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.834
Jeesh!

03:44.868 --> 03:47.033
Rieger, I think
your honker

03:47.067 --> 03:49.467
is most suited
for this task.

03:50.934 --> 03:52.400
I mean, uh...

03:56.367 --> 03:57.667
I mean,

03:57.701 --> 04:00.400
you could smell these things
from home.

04:02.734 --> 04:04.200
Go on.

04:04.234 --> 04:05.901
( <i>sniffs</i> )

04:09.167 --> 04:10.934
That one seems ideal.

04:10.968 --> 04:13.133
My choice, too.

04:13.167 --> 04:15.334
"Cruel Cavalier."

04:15.367 --> 04:19.267
Won't be a mosquito
near him all night.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.767
Boy, Elaine sure turned out
to be a good shop steward.

04:22.801 --> 04:26.400
I'm hoping she turns out
to be a great one.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.601
There's something
strange going on.

04:28.634 --> 04:31.968
What did you say
Elaine was doing tonight?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.968
I told you.
She was going
to take a night off--

04:35.000 --> 04:37.567
get her mind off work.

04:37.601 --> 04:39.200
Boy.

04:39.234 --> 04:43.000
I don't know why they put so
many pins in these new shirts.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.300
Takes you an hour
to get them off.

04:45.334 --> 04:47.534
Hey, Lou, just what
is it exactly

04:47.567 --> 04:50.000
you're getting
prepared for tonight?

04:50.033 --> 04:52.567
Oh, I got a little
social engagement.

04:52.601 --> 04:53.968
( <i>chuckling</i> )

04:54.000 --> 04:56.968
I don't even know
why I'm putting this shirt on.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.834
In a couple of hours, it's
going to be ripped from my body.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.334
Hey, if you guys will excuse me,

05:02.367 --> 05:04.300
I'm going to go over
to Elaine's apartment

05:04.334 --> 05:05.467
and see how she's doing.

05:05.501 --> 05:06.601
All right.

05:06.634 --> 05:07.968
Okay. Say hi.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.300
Hey, Rieger.

05:09.334 --> 05:11.434
You got a clean handkerchief
on you?

05:13.501 --> 05:15.501
Thanks.

05:21.701 --> 05:24.200
Welcome back, Rieger.

05:24.234 --> 05:25.834
Hey, Lou, you missed
one of the pins.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.334
Where?
Here.

05:27.367 --> 05:28.467
Ow!

05:28.501 --> 05:29.901
Nice to be back, Lou.

05:43.701 --> 05:45.367
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

05:45.400 --> 05:48.734
You're early,
and she doesn't live here,

05:48.767 --> 05:50.934
and I have
a headache!

05:50.968 --> 05:52.634
Oh, God. It's true.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.567
Oh, Alex, what
are you doing here?

05:54.601 --> 05:56.367
Who were you expecting, Elaine?

05:56.400 --> 05:58.868
My date.
Uh... somebody you don't know.

05:58.901 --> 06:01.033
Oh? Tell me about him.

06:01.067 --> 06:05.067
Oh, well, uh, his name is Joe,
and he's a tall blond doctor,

06:05.100 --> 06:08.167
and he likes
me very much,
and won't hurt me.

06:10.701 --> 06:12.434
Elaine, I know all about it.

06:12.467 --> 06:14.434
I just left Louie at the garage

06:14.467 --> 06:15.968
in mid-drool.

06:17.467 --> 06:19.734
I'm absolutely terrified
about this whole thing.

06:19.767 --> 06:22.567
I mean, it's the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

06:22.601 --> 06:24.367
Elaine, you don't
have to do this.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.601
The duties
of a shop steward

06:26.634 --> 06:30.100
do not entail mixing
business with terror.

06:30.133 --> 06:32.200
It's not part
of a shop steward's duties

06:32.234 --> 06:33.534
to date Louie, you know.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.701
Stubby Detmuller
never did it.

06:35.734 --> 06:37.334
There <i>was</i> that one time

06:37.367 --> 06:40.767
when he went out dancing
with Louie on New Year's Eve.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.200
I'm just trying
to cheer you up.

06:42.234 --> 06:43.934
I don't need cheering up.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.501
I need <i>tanking</i> up.

06:45.534 --> 06:46.934
( <i>knock at door</i> )

06:46.968 --> 06:49.033
Hide me!

06:49.067 --> 06:50.567
 <i>Open the door</i>

06:50.601 --> 06:54.267
 <i>and feast your eyes</i>
 <i>on a 150 pounds of hickey bait!</i>

06:59.267 --> 07:01.734
Alex, if I ask
you real nice,

07:01.767 --> 07:05.000
will you take
this bottle and
beat me senseless?

07:05.033 --> 07:07.234
Elaine, want me
to talk to him--

07:07.267 --> 07:09.434
tell him
the whole thing's off?

07:09.467 --> 07:11.434
No. No, no.
It can't be off.

07:11.467 --> 07:12.767
Oh...

07:12.801 --> 07:15.100
Oh, I got to go
through with this.

07:15.133 --> 07:16.767
I mean,
it's the only way

07:16.801 --> 07:19.033
we're going to
settle the strike.

07:19.067 --> 07:22.000
Would you watch him
while I get ready?

07:22.033 --> 07:23.434
( <i>knocking</i> )

07:23.467 --> 07:24.868
 <i>Please open the door!</i>

07:24.901 --> 07:27.067
 <i>You don't know how long</i>

07:27.100 --> 07:30.634
 <i>I've waited to feast my eyes</i>
 <i>on your loveliness.</i>

07:45.601 --> 07:48.033
What are you
doing here, Rieger?

07:48.067 --> 07:49.634
Elaine was called away.

07:49.667 --> 07:52.534
I'm the deputy shop steward,
and I'm taking over.

07:52.567 --> 07:55.033
Drinky-poo?

07:55.067 --> 07:56.601
Cut the jokes, Rieger.

07:56.634 --> 07:57.834
Where's Nardo?

07:57.868 --> 07:59.834
Ah! My little girl
is getting ready.

07:59.868 --> 08:01.834
Well, this gives
me an opportunity

08:01.868 --> 08:04.400
to get to know
the man she's dating.

08:04.434 --> 08:06.100
Sit down, young man.

08:06.133 --> 08:07.501
And tell me...

08:07.534 --> 08:09.901
what is it you do
for a living?

08:09.934 --> 08:12.968
What are you talking about,
Rieger?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.734
You know I'm a dispatcher.

08:15.767 --> 08:17.367
Oh, a dispatcher.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.133
I thought you were
much more than that.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.834
You seem like vermin.

08:23.267 --> 08:27.300
You're getting in the way
of my good time, Rieger.

08:27.334 --> 08:29.934
Now, why don't
you take a powder?

08:29.968 --> 08:32.133
Ah, the impatience
of youth.

08:32.167 --> 08:33.701
Tell me, young man,

08:33.734 --> 08:35.833
are your intentions
honorable here?

08:35.868 --> 08:38.433
My intentions, Rieger,

08:38.467 --> 08:41.000
are to take a trip
around the moon.

08:41.033 --> 08:42.667
Now, where is she?

08:42.701 --> 08:44.234
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

08:44.267 --> 08:45.701
Just take it easy.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.100
Just take it easy.

08:47.133 --> 08:48.934
I'll see if she's ready.

08:48.968 --> 08:51.267
Elaine, your
young snake is here.

08:51.300 --> 08:53.868
What are you talking about,

08:53.901 --> 08:55.767
Rieger?

08:55.801 --> 08:57.868
Nardo is going
to have the time

08:57.901 --> 09:00.167
of her life tonight.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.400
I got this
whole evening programmed.

09:02.434 --> 09:04.601
There's not a man,
woman, or child

09:04.634 --> 09:06.601
that we're going
to bump into tonight

09:06.634 --> 09:07.968
who isn't on my payroll.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.434
I been out all morning
greasing palms.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.701
I'll bet.

09:11.734 --> 09:14.067
( <i>chuckling</i> )

09:14.100 --> 09:16.701
Come on out,
my little vision!

09:26.501 --> 09:29.200
What the hell is this?

09:29.234 --> 09:30.901
Now, now.
The little lady's wise.

09:30.934 --> 09:33.267
There's a lot of flu
going around these days.

09:33.300 --> 09:35.801
You know how easy it is
to pick up a little bug.

09:35.834 --> 09:37.133
I found out.

09:39.167 --> 09:43.067
Nardo, you look like
Nanook of the North.

09:43.100 --> 09:45.033
There was nothing
in our agreement

09:45.067 --> 09:46.501
about how I had to dress.

09:46.534 --> 09:48.801
Well, it's getting late.
I've got to go.

09:48.834 --> 09:50.868
I'll leave you two kids
to your fun.

09:50.901 --> 09:53.067
Uh, Louie, don't you think
it would be nice

09:53.100 --> 09:54.434
if Alex came with us?

09:54.467 --> 09:56.734
Now, now, now, Elaine,
come on, you gave your word.

09:56.767 --> 09:58.167
You got to go
through with this.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.534
You got to go through
with it.

09:59.567 --> 10:00.601
Elaine, please. Elaine.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.167
Now listen, Louie.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.300
Incidentally,
all kidding aside,

10:04.334 --> 10:06.400
if you try anything
with Elaine...

10:06.434 --> 10:07.834
and I'll kill you.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.434
It will take
the coroner a week

10:10.467 --> 10:12.734
to pry the grin
off my face.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.334
Besides, you'll
have to catch me.

10:19.367 --> 10:20.834
I'll catch you.

10:20.868 --> 10:23.000
I'll just send
the hounds out

10:23.033 --> 10:26.167
after the scent
of "Cruel Cavalier." Whoo!

10:38.801 --> 10:42.000
Now don't be afraid,
my little one.

10:42.033 --> 10:43.634
Are you ready to take

10:43.667 --> 10:45.701
your magic carpet
ride with me?

10:45.734 --> 10:47.133
( <i>sighs</i> )

10:47.167 --> 10:48.801
One last request?

10:48.834 --> 10:52.567
Could I call my children
at the baby-sitter's?

10:52.601 --> 10:54.400
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:54.434 --> 10:55.834
Call the tots.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.901
Tell them hi from Uncle Lou.

11:05.133 --> 11:06.534
Hi, Mrs. Williams.

11:06.567 --> 11:09.601
Yes, I'd like to speak
to my children, please,

11:09.634 --> 11:12.133
uh, both of them,
so could you put

11:12.167 --> 11:14.968
their little ears
to the receiver?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.334
Hi, babies.

11:16.367 --> 11:17.934
( <i>sobbing</i> )

11:17.968 --> 11:21.601
I want you to remember
that no matter what happens...

11:21.634 --> 11:24.300
no matter what you hear
about tonight

11:24.334 --> 11:27.100
I want you to always
remember your mother

11:27.133 --> 11:29.934
the way she was
the last time you saw her--

11:29.968 --> 11:33.334
young and fresh

11:33.367 --> 11:35.667
and happy.

11:35.701 --> 11:37.734
And I love you
very much.

11:37.767 --> 11:39.067
Okay.

11:39.100 --> 11:40.501
( <i>sobbing</i> ):
Okay, good-bye.

11:40.534 --> 11:41.501
( <i>smacking lips</i> )
Good-bye.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.567
( <i>smacking lips</i> )
Good-bye.

11:42.601 --> 11:43.567
Good-bye.

11:43.601 --> 11:45.000
 Good-bye.
 <i>Good-bye.</i>

11:47.667 --> 11:49.734
Nardo, I don't think
you're going into this

11:49.767 --> 11:51.000
with the right attitude.

11:54.167 --> 11:56.667
Let's just get
this over with.

11:59.267 --> 12:00.834
Allow me.

12:08.133 --> 12:09.667
The ice is broken.

12:19.934 --> 12:23.567
( <i>Hawaiian music plays</i> )

12:23.601 --> 12:24.901
Okay, come on.

12:24.934 --> 12:27.434
Sit right down there.

12:27.467 --> 12:30.434
May I get you one
of our exotic cocktails?

12:30.467 --> 12:31.801
Oh, yes, Fritz.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.067
I'd like two
monsoons, please.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.267
Yes. Very good,
Mr. De Palma.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.300
( <i>chuckles</i> )

12:45.400 --> 12:48.467
You're going to love this drink.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.801
I kind of thought,
Nardo, that we'd have

12:50.834 --> 12:53.734
a little trouble with the
conversation department,

12:53.767 --> 12:57.334
so I took the liberty to
write up some notes here.

12:57.367 --> 12:58.801
I mean, you know,

12:58.834 --> 13:01.534
it's things that
you would say to me

13:01.567 --> 13:03.534
and my answers
back to you.

13:03.567 --> 13:05.701
Here's your copy.

13:05.734 --> 13:09.067
You've written
our entire conversation?

13:09.100 --> 13:12.067
Well, not the whole thing,
but just to get us rolling here.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.234
You have the first line.

13:19.267 --> 13:22.701
"I guess you know
I have two children."

13:22.734 --> 13:24.167
"Ah, children.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.000
"Reminds me of the old phrase:

13:28.634 --> 13:31.834
"'Better is a poor
and wise child

13:31.868 --> 13:35.434
than an old and foolish king.'"

13:35.467 --> 13:36.801
That's interesting.

13:36.834 --> 13:38.801
Read.

13:38.834 --> 13:41.133
"That's interesting."

13:42.934 --> 13:45.701
"It must be hard,
raising two kids

13:45.734 --> 13:48.167
and holding down two jobs."

13:48.200 --> 13:50.734
"Well, I don't complain."

13:54.234 --> 13:56.834
"Should we order dinner now?"

13:56.868 --> 13:59.701
"No, I think we should order
another drink.

13:59.734 --> 14:02.434
I'm really enjoying
our conversation."

14:04.334 --> 14:06.267
Ah.

14:06.300 --> 14:07.734
Here you go.

14:07.767 --> 14:09.701
There you go, sir.

14:09.734 --> 14:11.367
Thank you, Edmundo.

14:13.901 --> 14:15.000
Oh!

14:15.033 --> 14:16.667
Ooh!

14:16.701 --> 14:19.767
( <i>guttural chuckling</i> )

14:19.801 --> 14:22.501
Oh, well, maybe we
better skip down there

14:22.534 --> 14:24.901
because my timing's
a little off here.

14:24.934 --> 14:27.434
That's not my line.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.200
Yeah. Yeah, that's
your line right there.

14:30.234 --> 14:33.400
"You have beautiful eyes."

14:34.701 --> 14:36.367
"Thank you."

14:36.400 --> 14:39.200
"Now, let's tear up
this piece of paper

14:39.234 --> 14:40.701
and dance, stallion."

14:42.367 --> 14:44.934
I'm not going
to dance, Louie.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.267
Nardo, it's not a date
unless you dance with me.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.267
You want to call
the whole thing off?

14:49.300 --> 14:50.601
Do you even know how to dance?

14:50.634 --> 14:51.701
I mean, I like dancing.

14:51.734 --> 14:53.901
I don't want to get out there
and embarrass myself.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.234
Are you kidding?

14:55.267 --> 14:57.701
I do a great tango.

14:57.734 --> 14:59.734
Tango at the Tide Pool?

14:59.767 --> 15:02.501
Yeah. I spent all morning
taking lessons

15:02.534 --> 15:04.334
from a gay Spanish guy.

15:04.367 --> 15:05.767
Louie, look at that band.

15:05.801 --> 15:08.467
They don't even look like
they'd know a tango.

15:10.467 --> 15:11.601
Play, savages!

15:11.634 --> 15:13.267
( <i>drum roll</i> )

15:23.701 --> 15:25.701
( <i>tango playing</i> )

15:41.534 --> 15:43.234
Kick!

15:43.267 --> 15:44.467
Kick!

15:44.501 --> 15:46.033
Kick!

15:47.634 --> 15:50.601
And in and out

15:50.634 --> 15:51.968
and out

15:52.000 --> 15:54.234
and up, and slide, and...

16:03.801 --> 16:05.300
Come on, Fritz!

16:05.334 --> 16:06.834
Get 'em up!

16:28.200 --> 16:29.834
LOUIE:
 <i>So the guy says</i>

16:29.868 --> 16:32.033
the guy says to the farmer

16:32.067 --> 16:34.801
"Just give me
what the rooster gets."

16:34.834 --> 16:36.834
( <i>laughing</i> )

16:46.033 --> 16:47.267
Oh, well.

16:47.300 --> 16:51.934
Oh, well, home again,
home again jiggedy-jog.

16:51.968 --> 16:54.234
Home? Is it over?

16:57.534 --> 17:00.067
Well, Elaine,
wasn't that Tide Pool

17:00.100 --> 17:03.200
everything I told you
it was going to be?

17:03.234 --> 17:06.467
I mean, I'll bet
you never been to a place

17:06.501 --> 17:09.968
where the waiter prepares
your food at the table.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.901
Pork chops?

17:12.934 --> 17:15.032
Aw, boy.
You know something?

17:15.067 --> 17:17.968
I never knew that you
were such a drinker.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.567
I mean, you put away
six monsoons,

17:20.601 --> 17:23.434
and that's gotta be
a Tide Pool record.

17:23.467 --> 17:26.400
You don't even look
the least bit sloshed.

17:26.434 --> 17:28.501
And that's not even counting

17:28.534 --> 17:31.801
the three drinks I had
before you arrived.

17:31.834 --> 17:34.834
You had three drinks
before I got here?

17:34.868 --> 17:37.234
To wash down the Valium.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.868
Geez. I thought
something like that

17:39.901 --> 17:41.567
would kill a person.

17:41.601 --> 17:43.701
So did I.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.367
Good night, Louie.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.634
What are you...?!

17:49.667 --> 17:52.467
Whoa! What do you mean--
good night?

17:52.501 --> 17:53.801
Evening's young!

17:53.834 --> 17:55.000
Come on, Nardo.

17:55.033 --> 17:57.133
We got leftover
garlic bread

17:57.167 --> 17:58.334
and shrimp puffs.

17:58.367 --> 17:59.434
Come on!

17:59.467 --> 18:02.267
I thought maybe
you'd invite me in

18:02.300 --> 18:04.767
for a little
midnight snack.

18:04.801 --> 18:06.200
Good night, Louie.

18:06.234 --> 18:08.267
The deal's over.

18:08.300 --> 18:10.901
Deal? You're still
talking deal?

18:10.934 --> 18:12.167
Come on, Nardo.

18:12.200 --> 18:15.067
That deal was made when
we were rational people,

18:15.100 --> 18:17.334
not pagans.

18:18.734 --> 18:20.934
Aw, don't blow
that thing again.

18:20.968 --> 18:23.300
Just don't
come near me.

18:23.334 --> 18:25.400
Come on, Louie, it's late.

18:25.434 --> 18:29.300
I just want to go in
and shower and burn my clothes.

18:29.334 --> 18:30.400
Wait, wait.

18:30.434 --> 18:32.400
Hold on, here, Nardo.

18:32.434 --> 18:34.734
I had just about enough of this.

18:34.767 --> 18:37.767
You know, I shelled out
some good money on you tonight.

18:37.801 --> 18:39.901
The least you
could have done

18:39.934 --> 18:42.033
was strip down
to your dress.

18:42.067 --> 18:44.501
I know you're in there
somewhere.

18:44.534 --> 18:47.133
Louie, please, it's been
a long day for both of us.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.200
Now, come on, let's
just say good night.

18:49.234 --> 18:52.834
Okay. Oh, okay, you're right.

18:52.868 --> 18:55.501
Okay, I'm going to go.

18:55.534 --> 18:58.334
But you know something, Elaine?

18:58.367 --> 19:00.167
I mean, if you'd have just...

19:00.200 --> 19:02.267
just relaxed
a little bit tonight,

19:02.300 --> 19:04.601
you might have had a good time.

19:04.634 --> 19:08.701
But, no, no, you won't allow
yourself to have fun with me.

19:08.734 --> 19:10.334
( <i>sighs</i> )

19:10.367 --> 19:13.968
I was looking forward
to it all day.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.701
I mean, I get dressed up
real swell.

19:19.734 --> 19:24.501
Take a beautiful woman
out on the town...

19:24.534 --> 19:28.634
I guess I'm just not
as sophisticated as you.

19:31.767 --> 19:33.601
No "Wait, Louie"?

19:36.434 --> 19:38.701
Okay, so maybe I'm...

19:38.734 --> 19:42.934
I'm a little rough
around the edges, all right?

19:42.968 --> 19:46.601
All I wanted was to have
one classy evening in my life

19:46.634 --> 19:49.934
but most of all, I wanted you
to have a good time,

19:49.968 --> 19:54.300
maybe change
your opinion of me.

19:58.367 --> 19:59.868
Nothing.

20:08.868 --> 20:12.200
If it will make you feel
any better, Elaine,

20:12.234 --> 20:14.434
I didn't have any fun either.

20:16.734 --> 20:21.100
And if you think
that it's impossible

20:21.133 --> 20:24.901
to hurt my feelings,
well, you're wrong.

20:30.334 --> 20:32.367
Just a second, Louie.

20:37.501 --> 20:42.067
If it will make <i>you</i> feel
any better...

20:42.100 --> 20:44.767
the evening wasn't
totally rotten.

20:48.734 --> 20:52.968
Actually, uh...
I <i>almost</i> enjoyed the dancing.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.501
You know?

20:54.534 --> 20:57.901
Especially when everybody
got around in a big circle

20:57.934 --> 20:59.934
you know, and started clapping.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.901
( <i>laughing</i> )

21:05.567 --> 21:07.234
( <i>chuckling</i> )

21:07.267 --> 21:11.133
Enthusiasm like that
doesn't come cheap.

21:11.167 --> 21:13.701
( <i>humming</i> )

21:16.467 --> 21:17.834
Ha-ha!

21:17.868 --> 21:19.167
Ah!

21:19.200 --> 21:20.901
Oh!

21:20.934 --> 21:22.667
Oh, Nardo.

21:22.701 --> 21:24.033
Ah, Louie.

21:26.901 --> 21:28.367
Thank you, Louie.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.567
Yeah?

21:29.601 --> 21:31.000
Yeah. It was okay.

21:31.033 --> 21:32.667
You really mean that?

21:32.701 --> 21:34.934
Yeah, I do.

21:34.968 --> 21:36.067
I knew it.

21:36.100 --> 21:38.367
I knew you
were starting to have fun.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.467
Oh, a little bit.

21:39.501 --> 21:40.868
Just a little?
A little bit.

21:40.901 --> 21:43.100
Aw, Nardo. You know what, Nardo?

21:43.133 --> 21:45.968
You know what would round
this evening out?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.467
A good night kiss.

21:47.501 --> 21:49.100
Oh, come on.
All right, that's it.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.501
Now, come on, come on!

21:50.534 --> 21:52.734
Oh, come on, <i>come on!</i>

21:52.767 --> 21:55.100
Just a little kiss,
come on.

21:57.968 --> 22:01.234
It would mean a lot to me.

22:01.267 --> 22:02.667
Come on.

22:02.701 --> 22:04.834
All right, come on, just
a little peck on my...!

22:04.868 --> 22:05.868
Peck.

22:06.934 --> 22:09.133
Come on!

22:09.167 --> 22:10.734
Come on, just show me

22:10.767 --> 22:13.234
that, like, you know,
this evening wasn't
a total disaster,

22:13.267 --> 22:15.634
you don't think
any less of me.

22:17.534 --> 22:19.167
All right, all right.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.434
Here. There.

22:20.467 --> 22:22.834
I'll put the shrimp puffs down.

22:22.868 --> 22:26.133
Okay, I put the garlic bread
there, all right?

22:26.167 --> 22:27.601
Okay? All right.

22:27.634 --> 22:29.267
I'll stand over here.

22:29.300 --> 22:31.667
I'll put my hands
at my sides.

22:31.701 --> 22:32.767
I won't move.

22:32.801 --> 22:34.534
And you can kiss me.

22:34.567 --> 22:36.801
Go ahead. I'll
close my eyes.

22:36.834 --> 22:37.934
Come on.

22:37.968 --> 22:39.300
Come on.
