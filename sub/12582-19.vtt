<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:32.381 --> 00:36.318
And after he bagged her,
he bagged Marilyn Monroe.

00:36.352 --> 00:39.651
Okay, that's Kennedy
number five.

00:39.689 --> 00:41.247
Anyone have
something different?

00:41.291 --> 00:42.781
Oh, good.

00:42.826 --> 00:43.952
Go ahead, Bobby.

00:45.395 --> 00:46.919
I have chosen the smartest

00:46.963 --> 00:49.591
and most photogenic of
all the presidents...

00:49.632 --> 00:51.623
Mr. Martin Sheen.

00:51.668 --> 00:53.067
President Sheen
is a Nobel Prize

00:53.103 --> 00:55.037
winner in economics,

00:55.071 --> 00:56.766
yet he loves poetry.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.967
And despite round-
the-clock meetings,

00:59.008 --> 01:02.500
death threats and MS,
he still finds time

01:02.545 --> 01:05.241
for playful banter
with his senior staff.

01:05.281 --> 01:06.509
Bobby, your assignment

01:06.549 --> 01:08.540
was to research
an actual president.

01:08.585 --> 01:09.984
Martin Sheen is an actor.

01:10.019 --> 01:11.145
Oh, yeah?

01:11.187 --> 01:13.018
Tell that to the 50
million people

01:13.056 --> 01:14.853
he helped with his
poverty bill.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.251
Hey, Steve-O, I'm going to drive

01:18.294 --> 01:20.057
this golf cart with my butt.

01:22.232 --> 01:25.065
Hey, my hummingbird feeder just
got its first customer.

01:25.101 --> 01:26.625
Bobby, come take a look.

01:26.669 --> 01:27.795
Bobby?

01:27.837 --> 01:28.861
Huh?

01:28.905 --> 01:29.894
Oh, I've seen them.

01:29.939 --> 01:31.873
Animal Planet did hummingbirds

01:31.908 --> 01:33.876
in their "Wings of Fury" week.

01:33.910 --> 01:35.673
But you don't even
have to stand up.

01:35.712 --> 01:37.339
Just cock your head
a little bit.

01:37.380 --> 01:38.608
Bobby?

01:38.648 --> 01:41.173
Yeah, Johnny, I'm going
to drive it into a wall.

01:41.217 --> 01:42.343
What?

01:42.385 --> 01:43.977
Ah, never mind.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.009
Bobby, what are you

01:45.054 --> 01:46.487
doing watching TV?

01:46.523 --> 01:48.616
You have an oral
report to redo.

01:48.658 --> 01:49.750
Your son thought

01:49.793 --> 01:51.488
Martin Sheen was a president.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.052
No, I didn't.

01:53.096 --> 01:54.791
But his character's based

01:54.831 --> 01:57.391
on the real
President Bartlett, right?

01:57.433 --> 01:58.525
No.

01:58.568 --> 02:00.160
See, this is exactly
what happens

02:00.203 --> 02:02.034
when you watch
too much television.

02:02.071 --> 02:03.163
Bobby, turn that off.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.935
I'm freaking driving
this over...

02:06.976 --> 02:08.341
All the way off.

02:12.015 --> 02:14.074
You can't keep
coming home after school

02:14.117 --> 02:16.085
and plopping down
in front of the TV.

02:16.119 --> 02:17.347
Mm-hmm.
He's right.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.412
It is not good for
you or the couch.

02:19.455 --> 02:21.548
Starting tomorrow,
you're getting yourself

02:21.591 --> 02:23.616
an extracurricular activity,

02:23.660 --> 02:24.957
something to keep you busy

02:24.994 --> 02:27.394
before your mother and I
come home from work.

02:27.430 --> 02:28.226
But, Dad...

02:28.264 --> 02:29.390
No "buts."

02:29.432 --> 02:30.956
Now go start that report.

02:33.603 --> 02:35.195
But which president
should I...

02:37.907 --> 02:40.637
Ronald Reagan.

02:42.378 --> 02:43.402
Hey, Bobby.

02:43.446 --> 02:44.572
What are you doing?

02:44.614 --> 02:45.706
Nothing.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.545
I'm supposed to be
in chess club,

02:47.584 --> 02:48.949
but they kicked me out.

02:48.985 --> 02:50.976
If they don't want you
to double jump,

02:51.020 --> 02:53.352
they shouldn't play it
on a checkers board.

02:53.389 --> 02:55.414
Sorry I can't stay and
listen to you vent,

02:55.458 --> 02:57.187
but our Quiz Bowl
team keeps losing,

02:57.227 --> 02:59.195
and now Coach Grandy
is making us

02:59.229 --> 03:00.992
do mind sprints after school.

03:01.030 --> 03:02.520
How could you ever lose?

03:02.565 --> 03:04.658
You're the smartest
person I know.

03:04.701 --> 03:07.602
It's those stupid pop
culture questions.

03:07.637 --> 03:09.901
How are we supposed to know
what <i>Out of Sight</i> actor

03:09.939 --> 03:11.338
got his start
on <i>The Facts of</i>...

03:11.374 --> 03:13.842
George Clooney.
Everybody knows that.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.873
Osmosis, mitosis, meiosis.

03:18.915 --> 03:20.507
Osmosis, mitosis, meiosis.

03:20.550 --> 03:22.108
No, base ten!

03:22.151 --> 03:24.051
Base ten! Idiot!

03:26.422 --> 03:27.480
Hello, Connie.

03:27.523 --> 03:28.683
Uh, I'm sorry, Bobby.

03:28.725 --> 03:30.352
When you want change
for the vending machine

03:30.393 --> 03:33.157
you're going to have to start
going to someone else.

03:33.196 --> 03:35.187
No, Bobby wants
to join the team.

03:35.231 --> 03:37.631
Why would we want Booby Hill?

03:37.667 --> 03:40.192
So the other teams
feel sorry for us?

03:40.236 --> 03:41.897
They already feel sorry for us

03:41.938 --> 03:45.169
because you can't remember
the atomic weight of lithium.

03:46.442 --> 03:48.808
Bobby's going to be
our secret weapon.

03:48.845 --> 03:50.142
He's not a math guy, is he?

03:50.179 --> 03:51.669
Because I'm
the math guy, right?

03:51.714 --> 03:52.840
Right?

03:52.882 --> 03:55.282
No, Bobby's a pop
culture expert.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.717
Oh, really?

03:56.753 --> 03:58.983
Ernie, ask him that one
you didn't know.

03:59.022 --> 04:00.512
You didn't know it either.

04:00.556 --> 04:03.616
"What actor gave Peter Parker
a new face in 2002?"

04:04.727 --> 04:06.126
Tobey Maguire.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.186
Is he right?

04:08.798 --> 04:09.765
He's right.

04:09.799 --> 04:11.096
Bravo, Bobby.

04:11.134 --> 04:13.068
Welcome to the team.

04:13.102 --> 04:15.036
Dawn, American Lit.

04:15.071 --> 04:17.266
Just so you know, you
should bring your own pen.

04:17.307 --> 04:18.603
We have a thing about pens.

04:21.744 --> 04:23.234
You guys hear that?

04:23.279 --> 04:26.806
That's the sweet sound
of Bobby not watching TV.

04:26.849 --> 04:29.374
I made him join an
after-school activity.

04:29.419 --> 04:31.319
How do you know
he's not watching TV

04:31.354 --> 04:32.787
at someone else's house?

04:32.822 --> 04:36.189
Or hiding in the bushes
with one of those mini-TVs?

04:36.225 --> 04:39.058
They keep making TVs
smaller and smaller,

04:39.095 --> 04:40.687
and bigger and bigger.

04:40.730 --> 04:42.061
Soon the medium TV

04:42.098 --> 04:43.861
is going to be
a thing of the past.

04:43.900 --> 04:45.162
Hey, Dad,

04:45.201 --> 04:46.168
guess what?

04:46.202 --> 04:47.931
I joined the academic team!

04:47.971 --> 04:49.836
Academic team?

04:49.872 --> 04:51.396
Is that a fancy way of saying

04:51.441 --> 04:52.999
you need to go to study hall?

04:53.042 --> 04:55.203
No, I'm the pop culture guy.

04:55.244 --> 04:55.972
The what?

04:56.012 --> 04:56.979
Come on. Test me.

04:57.013 --> 04:57.980
Give me a name.

04:58.014 --> 04:59.606
Michael... Douglas.

04:59.649 --> 05:01.082
No, Michael Keaton!

05:01.117 --> 05:03.449
<i>Mr. Mom, Gung-Ho, Beetle juice</i>
with Winona Ryder,

05:03.486 --> 05:04.783
<i>Batman, Batman Returns,</i>

05:04.821 --> 05:06.721
and the place
it all started...

05:06.756 --> 05:08.451
<i>Mr. Rogers'
Neighborhood.</i>

05:08.491 --> 05:10.391
Impressive.
I love <i>Mr. Rogers</i>.

05:10.426 --> 05:11.723
Wow, Hank.

05:11.761 --> 05:14.594
How's it feel to be
the father of a genius?

05:14.630 --> 05:17.190
Bobby's a good kid,
but he's no genius.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.463
We have the report cards
to prove it.

05:19.502 --> 05:21.629
And since when
is popular culture

05:21.671 --> 05:23.070
considered "academic"?

05:23.106 --> 05:25.233
It's serious business, Hank.

05:25.274 --> 05:27.708
You can't be a respected
university these days

05:27.744 --> 05:30.178
without offering a major
in commercial jingles

05:30.213 --> 05:33.239
or the films of
M. Night Shalamalaman.

05:33.282 --> 05:35.307
Yeah, man, talkin' 'bout
dem dang ol' Oberlin, man,

05:35.351 --> 05:37.319
you gotta ol' Phi Beta Kappa
on dem Muppets, yo.

05:37.353 --> 05:38.911
Well, that's asinine.

05:38.955 --> 05:42.516
What kind of job can you get
with a degree in pop culture?

05:42.558 --> 05:44.082
You can be a professor.

05:44.127 --> 05:45.526
Of pop culture.

05:45.561 --> 05:48.689
Wow, Bobby the Professor.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.769
Hey, Connie, this is so cool!

06:00.810 --> 06:02.107
Where should I sit?

06:02.145 --> 06:03.908
I didn't know
everybody got a buzzer.

06:03.946 --> 06:05.641
Quiz Bowl is so cool!

06:05.681 --> 06:07.239
I can't talk now, Bobby.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.444
I'm having trouble with
my German composers.

06:09.485 --> 06:11.009
Pachelbel!

06:11.054 --> 06:12.214
Hey, Jeremy,

06:12.255 --> 06:14.052
you ready to kick
some Denton brain?

06:14.090 --> 06:15.557
Can't you see I'm
trying to remember

06:15.591 --> 06:17.024
the Quadratic Formula?

06:17.060 --> 06:18.357
I mean equation.

06:18.394 --> 06:19.759
Oh, crap, which is it?!

06:19.796 --> 06:20.888
Sorry.

06:20.930 --> 06:23.160
Now, this is Bobby's
first match,

06:23.199 --> 06:25.224
so which is more
appropriate...

06:25.268 --> 06:26.963
air horn or thunder sticks?

06:27.003 --> 06:28.527
Because I have both.

06:28.571 --> 06:29.765
What?
Bobby on team?

06:29.806 --> 06:31.706
Quiz Bowl
for top of food chain,

06:31.741 --> 06:33.971
not C-student plankton.

06:37.513 --> 06:39.208
Welcome, <i>wilkommen,</i>

06:39.248 --> 06:40.613
<i>bienvenue</i>.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.915
Today's match features
Denton versus Tom Landry.

06:43.953 --> 06:45.545
Please test your buzzers.

06:47.690 --> 06:49.555
Category: Chemistry.

06:49.592 --> 06:53.119
Question: Negative 273 degrees
Kelvin

06:53.162 --> 06:54.789
is also known as what?

06:54.831 --> 06:56.196
Wassanasong,

06:56.232 --> 06:57.221
Tom Landry.

06:57.266 --> 06:58.893
Absolute zero.

06:58.935 --> 06:59.765
Correct.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.635
Category: Television.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.073
Who of the following is not
a Starfleet captain...

07:06.109 --> 07:08.202
Picard, Janeway or Data.

07:09.245 --> 07:10.644
Data!
Correct.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.011
But a warning,

07:12.048 --> 07:15.211
please wait to be recognized
by the Quizmaster.

07:16.853 --> 07:17.945
Hill, Tom Landry.

07:17.987 --> 07:20.148
Alvin, Simon and Theodore!

07:20.189 --> 07:21.349
Correct.

07:21.390 --> 07:22.516
And time expires.

07:22.558 --> 07:24.549
Winner: Tom Landry.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.229
Super.
Just super.

07:29.265 --> 07:30.926
With proper training,

07:30.967 --> 07:33.435
Bobby could lead the team
to the championship.

07:33.469 --> 07:35.460
They could be ♪1.

07:35.505 --> 07:38.497
Just think, if I hadn't sat him
in front of the TV

07:38.541 --> 07:41.408
to keep him from crying,
we would not be here today.

07:43.646 --> 07:45.443
Yep.

07:45.481 --> 07:48.348
Four parts water,
one part sugar.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.749
Got any leftovers?

07:49.785 --> 07:51.082
Hey, Dad,

07:51.120 --> 07:52.052
we won!

07:52.088 --> 07:53.419
You should've seen it.

07:53.456 --> 07:57.119
We came out strong...
math, spelling, geography.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.457
Then we hit the wall...

07:58.494 --> 08:00.860
two art histories
and a physics.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.057
Oh, no.

08:02.098 --> 08:03.861
How did you ever
recover, Professor?

08:03.900 --> 08:04.889
The lightning round.

08:04.934 --> 08:06.333
It was TV theme songs.

08:06.369 --> 08:07.563
I cleaned house.

08:10.439 --> 08:12.100
You know,
I wanted Bobby to become

08:12.141 --> 08:14.268
the kind of kid
who did stuff after school,

08:14.310 --> 08:15.800
but the stuff after school

08:15.845 --> 08:17.779
is just becoming
more like Bobby.

08:17.813 --> 08:20.748
You must be very proud.

08:20.783 --> 08:23.081
You were on fire
yesterday, Bobby!

08:23.119 --> 08:25.314
I can't believe you
made that kid cry.

08:25.354 --> 08:27.254
I'd cry, too, if I didn't
know what movies

08:27.290 --> 08:29.451
Denzel got his Oscars for.

08:29.492 --> 08:30.959
<i>Glory, Training Day</i>.

08:30.993 --> 08:32.255
Okay, people,

08:32.294 --> 08:33.557
cheeks in the chairs.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.063
We did great yesterday,

08:35.097 --> 08:37.657
but we still made
too many mistakes.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.099
I'm not going
to point fingers,

08:39.135 --> 08:41.365
but people who should have
a finger pointed at them

08:41.404 --> 08:42.631
know who they are.

08:42.672 --> 08:44.936
Chane, books on Copernicus.

08:44.974 --> 08:47.465
Dawn, the complete
works of Faulkner.

08:47.510 --> 08:50.570
Connie, memorize
the Goldberg Variations.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.342
And Bobby, here is

08:52.381 --> 08:54.781
<i>People, Us</i> and
<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>.

08:54.817 --> 08:57.115
Is this great or what?

08:57.153 --> 08:58.450
Hey, did you guys know that...

08:58.487 --> 08:59.977
Shh!

09:00.022 --> 09:02.582
You better start reading or
watching or whatever you do,

09:02.625 --> 09:04.820
because we're counting on you.

09:04.860 --> 09:06.384
Counting on me?

09:06.429 --> 09:08.989
Nobody's ever counted
on me before.

09:09.031 --> 09:11.261
I won't let you down.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.767
Shh!

09:22.712 --> 09:23.872
Bobby, breakfast.

09:23.913 --> 09:26.006
I am blanketing the pigs.

09:26.048 --> 09:28.516
I can't right now.
<i>TRL</i> is pop-up!

09:29.819 --> 09:31.218
Oh, dang it.

09:31.254 --> 09:33.085
I can't believe
you're serving him

09:33.122 --> 09:34.111
breakfast in bed.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.987
Breakfast was
the only motivation

09:36.025 --> 09:37.458
he had to leave his room.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.291
Hank, we are the parents
of a gifted child now.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.991
It is our responsibility
to nurture him.

09:43.032 --> 09:46.001
But the whole point was to get
him out of the house.

09:46.035 --> 09:47.798
If you were Einstein's father,

09:47.837 --> 09:49.464
we would not have the Bomb.

09:49.505 --> 09:52.235
Call our cable operator!

09:52.275 --> 09:54.675
There's a new MTV channel.

09:54.710 --> 09:57.304
I'm so glad
you're on the team now, Bobby.

09:57.346 --> 09:58.745
I really like winning.

09:58.781 --> 10:00.305
Here he is now,

10:00.349 --> 10:02.817
the brightest of all
my shining stars.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.820
I was just telling
Principal Moss

10:04.854 --> 10:06.822
about our team's
winning streak.

10:06.856 --> 10:07.948
To tell you the truth,

10:07.990 --> 10:09.821
I thought we cut
Quiz Bowl last year.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.292
Guess we got rid
of something else.

10:11.327 --> 10:12.692
Well, the budget
likes a winner,

10:12.728 --> 10:13.695
so keep it up.

10:13.729 --> 10:14.923
Oh, man.

10:14.964 --> 10:16.090
Look, we all know

10:16.132 --> 10:18.259
drama and band are
hanging by a thread.

10:18.301 --> 10:19.825
Quiz Bowl is all I have.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.463
Bobby, I'm counting on you
to lead us to victory.

10:22.505 --> 10:23.802
I'm trying.

10:23.839 --> 10:25.329
Remember, there's trying

10:25.374 --> 10:27.035
and there's trying harder.

10:27.076 --> 10:28.703
Try harder, Bobby.

10:28.744 --> 10:30.405
See you in class.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.708
I know this one.
I know I know it.

10:36.752 --> 10:37.844
Sine?

10:37.887 --> 10:39.752
No, cosine.

10:39.789 --> 10:41.416
Dang it! Dang it!

10:41.457 --> 10:43.584
Quiet down!
Next question:

10:43.626 --> 10:46.322
"This actor picked Cameron Diaz
over Julia Roberts

10:46.362 --> 10:47.954
in <i>My Best Friend's Wedding</i>.

10:47.997 --> 10:49.089
Come on, Coach.

10:49.131 --> 10:50.962
Give me a hard one.
Dylan McDermott.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.901
No. Dermot Mulroney.

10:53.936 --> 10:58.771
Oh... yeah, I always
get those guys mixed up.

10:58.808 --> 11:01.606
Someone needs a name change,
am I right?

11:04.647 --> 11:07.309
Let's take a break.
Who has the Tums?

11:07.350 --> 11:09.341
Hey, what's your problem?

11:09.385 --> 11:11.319
I'm trying!
I just goofed!

11:11.354 --> 11:13.379
Look, "Booby," I have a plan:

11:13.422 --> 11:15.549
The Chane Train
starts with Quiz Bowl

11:15.591 --> 11:17.149
and ends at a Stanford frat

11:17.193 --> 11:19.627
with all the ladies
I can handle.

11:19.662 --> 11:21.357
You're not gonna
blow it for me.

11:21.397 --> 11:23.058
You can't make
mistakes, Bobby.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.691
You just can't!

11:29.338 --> 11:31.966
Bobby gets so dang
many magazines.

11:32.007 --> 11:33.497
Couldn't at least one of them

11:33.542 --> 11:35.976
have a picture of a car
or a fish on it?

11:36.011 --> 11:38.502
Does sweeps start
this week or next?

11:38.547 --> 11:40.777
I don't know what that means.

11:40.816 --> 11:43.046
Man! Quiz Bowl
is getting tough.

11:43.085 --> 11:46.145
Yeah, it's real hard
sitting around watching TV.

11:46.188 --> 11:48.349
I know!

11:48.391 --> 11:49.722
They broke up?

11:49.759 --> 11:53.092
I haven't even read the one
where they got together!

11:58.167 --> 11:59.896
Bobby Hill!

11:59.935 --> 12:01.334
Come on down!

12:01.370 --> 12:02.428
How much you pay
for fabulous mini-fridge

12:02.471 --> 12:05.201
stocked with Red Bull
and Mountain Dew?

12:05.241 --> 12:06.538
Nothing!

12:06.575 --> 12:07.837
Free for you!

12:07.877 --> 12:09.139
But... why?

12:09.178 --> 12:11.169
Because you're the key
to getting Chane

12:11.213 --> 12:14.307
into the school
of his choice: Stanford.

12:14.350 --> 12:16.910
Connie choose Harvard.
And you pave the way.

12:16.952 --> 12:20.012
With new fridge,
you never have to leave your room.

12:20.055 --> 12:21.955
Everything on your shoulders!

12:27.963 --> 12:29.487
McMaynerbury.

12:29.532 --> 12:32.023
Ursa... Minor.

12:32.067 --> 12:33.193
Correct.

12:33.235 --> 12:34.315
McMaynerbury ties the game.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.998
And time expires.

12:37.039 --> 12:38.267
How delightful.

12:38.307 --> 12:39.672
We have a tie-breaker.

12:39.708 --> 12:42.541
The winner will face Durndle
in the district finals.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.481
Category: The Grammys.

12:47.883 --> 12:51.046
"Question: Who is Dana
Owens better known as?"

12:51.086 --> 12:52.485
Hill.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.647
Tom Landry.

12:57.660 --> 12:59.252
Five seconds.

13:04.467 --> 13:06.526
Queen Latifah?

13:09.104 --> 13:10.162
Correct.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.003
Winner: Tom Landry.

13:19.114 --> 13:20.479
When I directed this scene,

13:20.516 --> 13:22.074
the sky wasn't sad enough.

13:22.117 --> 13:24.085
Read about how we fixed it
in post

13:24.119 --> 13:25.586
in the companion book.

13:25.621 --> 13:27.452
Oh! Companion book!

13:29.558 --> 13:30.718
Your mother and I are headed

13:30.759 --> 13:32.158
to the Mega Lo Mart.

13:32.194 --> 13:34.526
It's the last day
of Super Savings.

13:34.563 --> 13:35.962
Wait! I'm coming with you!

13:36.932 --> 13:38.365
I got to get this one book,

13:38.400 --> 13:39.594
and <i>Sim City 4,</i>

13:39.635 --> 13:42.433
and I think J. Io's new CD
drops today.

13:42.471 --> 13:44.905
Grab my shoes!
I'll be in the car!

13:48.010 --> 13:50.035
Meet us by the wood glue

13:50.079 --> 13:51.137
in 20 minutes!

13:51.180 --> 13:52.875
I never noticed these before.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.145
I guess they're
trying to make shopping fun.

13:55.184 --> 13:56.981
It's working!

14:18.207 --> 14:19.799
I'm Kelly Clarkson.

14:19.842 --> 14:22.174
I won <i>American Idol</i> and my
debut album went to number one.

14:22.211 --> 14:24.702
One song on the album,
I wrote with Christina Aguilera.

14:24.747 --> 14:26.027
She was in the Mickey Mouse Club

14:26.048 --> 14:28.175
with Britney Spears
and Justin Timberlake.

14:28.217 --> 14:29.809
Justin is a member of N'Sync.

14:29.852 --> 14:31.376
They sing on the soundtrack
for <i>The Grinch,</i>

14:31.420 --> 14:32.785
starring Jim Carrey.

14:32.821 --> 14:34.083
Jim Carrey was in a movie
with Renee Zellweger,

14:34.123 --> 14:35.556
who's worked
with Catherine Zeta-Jones,

14:35.591 --> 14:36.956
who's acted with John Cusack,

14:36.992 --> 14:38.550
who has a house in Malibu
near Pamela Anderson,

14:38.594 --> 14:39.754
who dated Scott Baio,

14:39.795 --> 14:41.057
who was on <i>Happy Days</i>
with Ron Howard,

14:41.096 --> 14:43.064
who directed <i>Apollo 13,</i>
starring Tom Hanks,

14:43.098 --> 14:44.895
who's married to Rita Wilson,
who was in...

15:00.182 --> 15:01.672
Oh...

15:01.717 --> 15:03.014
What happened?

15:03.052 --> 15:04.542
Bobby! Are you okay?

15:04.587 --> 15:07.078
Follow the tip of my nose
with your eyes.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.481
Peggy, give him some air.

15:10.526 --> 15:12.153
Now, Bobby, you just fainted.

15:12.194 --> 15:12.956
How do you feel?

15:12.995 --> 15:14.155
I don't know.

15:14.196 --> 15:15.356
It was weird.

15:15.397 --> 15:18.366
It was like my heart
was on fast-forward,

15:18.400 --> 15:19.992
but my brain was on pause,

15:20.035 --> 15:21.764
then, nothing.

15:21.804 --> 15:23.931
Well, he <i>was</i> running
pretty fast,

15:23.973 --> 15:26.203
and it's a quarter-mile
to Electronics.

15:26.241 --> 15:28.402
His body isn't used
to that level of activity.

15:28.444 --> 15:30.503
Actually, Mr. Hill,
it sounds to me

15:30.546 --> 15:32.241
like your son
had a panic attack.

15:32.281 --> 15:34.010
A panic attack?!

15:34.049 --> 15:36.609
Uh, maybe we should
take him to a doctor.

15:36.652 --> 15:38.279
Sir, Mega Lo Mart trains us

15:38.320 --> 15:40.584
to take care of all
medical situations.

15:40.623 --> 15:42.386
Attention, shoppers.

15:42.424 --> 15:43.948
If there is a doctor
in the store,

15:43.993 --> 15:46.291
please report
to the Mega Lo clinic.

15:47.630 --> 15:48.858
Mr. And Mrs. Hill,

15:48.897 --> 15:51.058
it looks like Bobby
had a panic attack.

15:51.100 --> 15:52.124
Mm-hmm.

15:52.167 --> 15:53.896
Doctor, he's in middle school.

15:53.936 --> 15:55.563
What does he have
to panic about?

15:55.604 --> 15:58.072
Well, if I had to choose between
performing heart surgery

15:58.107 --> 16:00.439
or going to the seventh-grade
dance right now,

16:00.476 --> 16:02.410
Well, scalpel, please.

16:02.444 --> 16:03.775
So the boy's too tense?

16:03.812 --> 16:05.143
Well, what do you recommend?

16:05.180 --> 16:07.114
Icy Hot?
The Ben Gay?

16:07.149 --> 16:10.243
No, you can't just
put ointment on this, Mr. Hill.

16:10.285 --> 16:12.344
Teen stress
is a very serious problem

16:12.388 --> 16:16.051
that can lead to ulcers
and many other health concerns.

16:17.126 --> 16:18.320
Well, what should I do?

16:18.360 --> 16:19.952
Should I give him a hug?
Or does he need space?

16:19.995 --> 16:21.656
Well, there's a book
I can recommend...

16:21.697 --> 16:23.460
Oh, thank God.
There's a book.

16:24.967 --> 16:26.901
Well, I just checked on Bobby.

16:26.935 --> 16:28.766
He stopped
muttering to himself.

16:28.804 --> 16:30.533
You find anything in there?

16:30.572 --> 16:32.631
It says here that
what Bobby needs

16:32.675 --> 16:34.905
is a lifestyle <i>change</i>.

16:34.943 --> 16:36.774
Their words, my emphasis.

16:36.812 --> 16:40.145
Now, first, we have to
create a stress-free environment,

16:40.182 --> 16:42.343
or "a safe zone."

16:42.384 --> 16:43.646
If you need me
to build something,

16:43.686 --> 16:46.519
I've still got those
old tree house designs.

16:46.555 --> 16:47.886
Mm, no.

16:47.923 --> 16:51.086
It involves things like scented
candles, hot teas,

16:51.126 --> 16:53.253
positive affirmation...
Hank!

16:53.295 --> 16:55.263
Go make Bobby feel
good about himself.

16:55.297 --> 16:56.286
Compliment him.

16:56.331 --> 16:57.491
Okay.

16:57.533 --> 16:59.091
Uh... for what?

16:59.134 --> 17:01.193
Whatever!
Tell him he has good hair.

17:02.371 --> 17:04.167
What? He does!

17:05.307 --> 17:06.705
So, uh...

17:06.742 --> 17:09.142
your TV watching got you
under the weather, did it?

17:09.178 --> 17:11.042
Oh, yeah, I guess so.

17:11.079 --> 17:13.070
Wait a second.
What time is it?

17:13.115 --> 17:15.140
Did you hear
the weekly Top 40?

17:15.184 --> 17:16.173
What was number one?

17:16.218 --> 17:17.445
Did anything have a bullet?

17:17.486 --> 17:19.181
Don't worry about that
now, Bobby,

17:19.221 --> 17:20.347
just get some rest.

17:20.388 --> 17:21.788
But the countdown...

17:21.824 --> 17:24.156
Nielsen ratings...
super-size it.

17:24.193 --> 17:26.661
Uh, your mother likes your hair.

17:26.694 --> 17:29.357
<i>Hair,</i> directed
by Milos Forman!

17:39.208 --> 17:42.109
Oh, it's so dark
with this thing on.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.076
What are you doing?

17:43.112 --> 17:45.273
Shh. It's okay, Bobby.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.181
Everything is very safe.

17:48.217 --> 17:49.650
We're going
to take... Ow!

17:49.685 --> 17:51.585
Oh, okay...

17:51.620 --> 17:53.554
I just burned myself.

17:53.589 --> 17:57.047
But you are very, very safe.

17:58.227 --> 18:00.092
I got to get
some ice... here.

18:01.930 --> 18:03.625
Okay, Bobby,

18:03.665 --> 18:06.463
we're going to take
your mind on a journey.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.333
You're lying on the beach

18:08.370 --> 18:10.770
on a warm sunny day.

18:10.806 --> 18:12.899
Your legs feel like spaghetti.

18:12.941 --> 18:14.374
What kind of spaghetti?

18:14.409 --> 18:15.706
Fettuccine?
Angel Hair?

18:15.744 --> 18:17.109
Calm down, Bobby.

18:17.146 --> 18:20.809
How about some,
uh... tea?

18:20.849 --> 18:22.646
So how's the professor doing?

18:22.684 --> 18:24.311
He's really got himself
worked up,

18:24.353 --> 18:25.581
I tell you what.

18:25.621 --> 18:27.953
I just don't understand
where it's coming from.

18:27.990 --> 18:30.652
Well, it's tough being
a kid these days, Hank.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.922
All we had to worry
about was Vietnam,

18:32.961 --> 18:35.020
Charles Manson, swine flu.

18:35.063 --> 18:36.553
Is it that bad now?

18:36.598 --> 18:38.031
Heck, a hundred years ago,

18:38.066 --> 18:40.864
kids were working in pork
factories and coal mines.

18:40.903 --> 18:43.098
You can't tell me <i>that</i>
wasn't stressful.

18:43.138 --> 18:44.127
Hank's right.

18:44.173 --> 18:46.038
Back when Disneyland
first started,

18:46.074 --> 18:48.702
it was completely powered
by orphan children

18:48.744 --> 18:51.736
running on treadmills
in underground tunnels.

18:51.780 --> 18:55.841
And today, those kids
are the New York Yankees.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.546
Well, I better go flip over

18:58.587 --> 19:00.384
his "calming sounds" tape.

19:03.158 --> 19:05.558
Who wants to thumb wrestle?

19:07.129 --> 19:09.791
All this rain is making me
think of drowning.

19:09.832 --> 19:11.732
Oh! This is pointless.

19:11.767 --> 19:13.894
It's going to be okay, son.

19:13.936 --> 19:15.016
We'll get you through this.

19:15.037 --> 19:16.629
But I'm never going to relax.

19:16.672 --> 19:18.867
I keep thinking about movies
and music and Quiz Bowl

19:18.907 --> 19:21.068
and if I screw up,
nobody goes to college

19:21.109 --> 19:22.736
and Chane never gets
his trust fund.

19:22.778 --> 19:23.904
I need to quit!

19:24.947 --> 19:25.971
Whew!

19:26.014 --> 19:27.413
I feel better already.

19:27.449 --> 19:29.280
I quit.

19:29.318 --> 19:30.307
I quit.

19:30.352 --> 19:31.717
I quit!

19:31.753 --> 19:33.243
This is a miracle!

19:33.288 --> 19:35.722
Nobody ever
has to count on me again.

19:35.757 --> 19:38.453
Hey!
My stomach just unknotted!

19:38.493 --> 19:40.620
Bobby, I don't think
you should quit.

19:40.662 --> 19:42.425
What?! But <i>you</i> said

19:42.464 --> 19:44.728
this pop culture stuff
was stupid.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.234
Well, it is, but you
made a commitment to your team,

19:47.269 --> 19:48.566
and you should honor it.

19:48.604 --> 19:49.901
But the stress, Dad!

19:49.938 --> 19:51.530
What about the stress?

19:51.573 --> 19:53.541
Well, you might not
believe this, Bobby,

19:53.575 --> 19:55.406
but I get stressed
all the time.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.469
You?!
Yep.

19:57.512 --> 19:58.501
But I don't give up.

19:58.547 --> 20:00.242
I face my problems.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.045
Stress isn't bad, Bobby.

20:02.084 --> 20:05.076
Heck, if we weren't stressed about
the Nazis taking over Europe,

20:05.120 --> 20:07.247
we wouldn't have
fought World War II.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.587
What's bad is letting stress
make your life miserable.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.953
The big match is tomorrow.

20:13.996 --> 20:16.965
I don't know if I can get into
game shape by then.

20:16.999 --> 20:18.364
You can handle this, Bobby.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.367
And I'll help you.

20:26.241 --> 20:27.572
Well, hey, there,
Mr. Drysdale.

20:27.609 --> 20:30.407
I love <i>The Beverly</i>
<i>Hillbillies</i>.

20:30.445 --> 20:32.936
I talked Jethro into
staying to work for you.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.846
Show him your cipherin', boy!

20:34.883 --> 20:36.441
Naught times naught is naught.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.816
Naught times one is naught.

20:37.853 --> 20:39.753
Naught times two is naught.

20:39.788 --> 20:41.153
Whoo-doggy!

20:41.189 --> 20:43.282
That's what you get from
a sixth-grade education!

20:44.726 --> 20:47.024
You know, the guy who
played Jed Clampett

20:47.062 --> 20:48.757
also played <i>Barnaby Jones,</i>

20:48.797 --> 20:51.163
the milk-drinking
elderly private eye.

20:51.199 --> 20:52.632
Wow! Cool!

20:52.668 --> 20:53.999
And Jethro's dad,

20:54.036 --> 20:56.834
Max Baer Sr., was a
heavyweight boxing champ.

20:56.872 --> 20:58.669
He fought Joe Louis.

20:58.707 --> 21:01.369
Hey, Dad, why is Jethro
dressed so funny?

21:01.410 --> 21:03.810
He's trying to be
a double-naught spy.

21:05.113 --> 21:07.343
Look, he's putting on
his lead spy hat.

21:08.717 --> 21:10.378
Whoo-doggy!

21:10.419 --> 21:11.818
<i>Oh, Dad!</i>

21:13.488 --> 21:19.649
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

21:52.427 --> 21:55.021

Who has the Tums?</i>
