WEBVTT

00:01.275 --> 00:03.253
And here's me looking elated.

00:04.046 --> 00:05.874
And here's me looking serene.

00:05.999 --> 00:08.794
And here's me getting real.

00:08.919 --> 00:10.469
I was thinking about the middle east.

00:10.635 --> 00:12.614
It's intractable.

00:12.739 --> 00:15.223
It's cool, right, McKenna?

00:15.389 --> 00:16.391
She's a little shy.

00:16.557 --> 00:18.520
Oh, me too.

00:18.645 --> 00:20.622
So this is gonna be fun today.

00:20.747 --> 00:22.524
Should we check out
the nerve center of the show

00:22.649 --> 00:23.565
where all the magic happens?

00:23.731 --> 00:24.650
Whatever.

00:24.816 --> 00:28.278
"Whatever." You go, girl.

00:28.444 --> 00:31.698
Oh, my God.

00:31.864 --> 00:32.767
Hey, hi.

00:32.892 --> 00:33.950
Pipes burst upstairs.

00:34.116 --> 00:35.952
- I smell feces.
- It's not feces, honey.

00:36.118 --> 00:37.329
- I smell feces.
- It's not feces.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.998
- McKenna, wait out...
- But our offices are destroyed.

00:40.164 --> 00:41.166
Someone needs to shut off
the water main.

00:41.332 --> 00:43.712
"Water main." He's such a man.

00:43.837 --> 00:45.113
The other day at my home
he used the words,

00:45.238 --> 00:46.838
- "load-bearing wall."
- Amazing.

00:47.004 --> 00:47.923
Don't worry, Ava.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.841
- I'm saving your stuff.
- Great.

00:50.007 --> 00:51.837
And don't forget to grab
my gong, Missy.

00:51.962 --> 00:53.261
Blessed by Steven Seagal.

00:53.427 --> 00:55.347
Why is this happening?

00:55.513 --> 00:57.057
This is gonna kill the entire day.

00:57.223 --> 00:57.974
This is gonna kill about a week.

00:58.140 --> 00:59.101
- What?
- You need to replace

00:59.267 --> 01:01.062
- all the ceiling tiles...
- Ceiling tiles.

01:01.187 --> 01:02.697
- The drywall.
- Mm. Dry.

01:02.822 --> 01:04.299
The electrical system's
probably shot to hell.

01:04.424 --> 01:05.901
- Hell.
- Why does this stuff

01:06.026 --> 01:07.135
always happen to our show?

01:07.260 --> 01:08.854
I mean, do Ellen's pipes burst?

01:08.979 --> 01:10.779
No, they do not.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.640
You know what, Ellen did this.

01:12.765 --> 01:14.449
Oh, well played, Ellen.

01:14.615 --> 01:15.450
- Reagan, Reagan.
- What?

01:15.616 --> 01:17.035
You are too wound up.

01:17.201 --> 01:19.788
Go home, light
your outdoor pool candelabras,

01:19.954 --> 01:21.289
put on your best rose gold jewelry,

01:21.455 --> 01:23.417
and take a two-hour nude swim.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.253
- Okay.
- Hey, all.

01:25.378 --> 01:27.003
We're gonna take
the next few days off

01:27.169 --> 01:29.589
and run <i>the best of Ava</i>
while some big strong men

01:29.755 --> 01:31.326
come in and fix things.

01:31.451 --> 01:32.926
I got your...

01:36.189 --> 01:37.931
That's the wrong gong, isn't it?

01:38.097 --> 01:38.765
Yeah.

01:57.116 --> 01:59.454
This flood is the best thing

01:59.579 --> 02:00.789
that has ever happened to me, honey.

02:00.914 --> 02:02.040
- Yeah.
- I mean, look at us.

02:02.165 --> 02:05.193
We're on a weekday,
and I'm strolling, man.

02:05.318 --> 02:07.695
- Well...
- Look at all those suckers

02:07.820 --> 02:08.997
off to the rat race.

02:09.122 --> 02:10.756
Not me.
I jumped that ship.

02:10.922 --> 02:11.967
Hey, so you're still cool

02:12.092 --> 02:13.251
with me grabbing lunch
with Dave today?

02:13.376 --> 02:15.036
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
You go see Dave.

02:15.161 --> 02:17.345
You guys talk law
and bust corporations.

02:17.511 --> 02:19.207
Hashtag occupy, you know.

02:19.332 --> 02:21.476
Yeah, don't left-wing tweet
at me, please.

02:21.601 --> 02:23.711
No, I'm kid...
I mean, in fact I was thinking

02:23.836 --> 02:25.395
of taking Amy to the park anyway.

02:25.561 --> 02:27.148
Oh, that's a great idea.
Although, you know,

02:27.273 --> 02:28.482
she needs her nap
in, like, 20 minutes.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.385
She can be off-schedule
for one day, come on.

02:30.510 --> 02:32.103
Yeah, if you want
to have a beelzi-baby.

02:32.228 --> 02:33.278
A devil babe.

02:33.444 --> 02:36.072
Oh, God.
What's with the weeds?

02:36.238 --> 02:39.743
- Sweet old Len.
- Is sweet old Len a ghost?

02:39.909 --> 02:41.830
Is that the house that sweet
old Len murdered his family in?

02:41.955 --> 02:43.163
Len's an old man.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.066
He likes his yard
the way he likes it.

02:45.191 --> 02:46.835
Yeah, I don't... it's doing
that thing where they're looking

02:46.960 --> 02:47.836
like baby trees, honey.

02:47.961 --> 02:48.837
I hate that.

02:48.962 --> 02:50.605
Yeah, but he served in Korea,

02:50.730 --> 02:51.840
so you might just want to let it go.

02:51.965 --> 02:54.132
Well, it bugs me.
Okay, whatever.

02:55.769 --> 02:57.594
Ooh.
Honey, I like you

02:57.760 --> 02:59.471
in a black blazer and a nice Jean.

02:59.637 --> 03:01.850
Come on, babe,
don't say Jean in the singular.

03:01.975 --> 03:03.141
I hate that.

03:03.307 --> 03:04.970
It's the first time I hung out

03:05.095 --> 03:06.394
with anyone from work since I left,

03:06.560 --> 03:08.188
so I want them to know
that I'm still one of the guys.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.481
Can you roll my back?

03:09.647 --> 03:12.526
Yeah.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.262
So...

03:14.387 --> 03:16.530
This is feeling pretty gratuitous.

03:16.696 --> 03:17.697
Want me to do the front?

03:17.863 --> 03:18.865
Kind of... no.

03:19.031 --> 03:20.826
Come on.

03:23.830 --> 03:25.240
Ooh, that junk drawer's
a problem, honey.

03:25.365 --> 03:26.581
You want me to clean it up
while you're gone today?

03:26.747 --> 03:28.416
No, it's fine.

03:28.582 --> 03:30.001
Yeah, you can't even close it.

03:30.167 --> 03:32.330
You can if you force it a little bit.

03:32.455 --> 03:34.464
And, plus, it's got
all the stuff I need.

03:34.630 --> 03:39.888
You need soy sauce packets,
loose batteries,

03:40.013 --> 03:42.222
and Dracula teeth.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.891
Don't worry about it.
Just take the day off.

03:45.057 --> 03:46.601
I really don't mind.

03:46.767 --> 03:48.854
- I'll go to the container store...
- I like it.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.098
Okay.

03:50.223 --> 03:51.132
All right?

03:51.257 --> 03:52.607
Plus, I need these for later.

03:52.773 --> 03:54.526
'Cause I'm doing...

03:54.692 --> 03:56.071
Okay... aagh!
Okay.

03:56.196 --> 03:58.488
Have a good lunch, honey.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.820
I'm just gonna clean it up
just a little bit.

04:11.945 --> 04:13.588
A little bit.

04:13.713 --> 04:15.755
All right.

04:17.083 --> 04:20.594
Oh, Chris t. Brink's truck,
back it up.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.761
Here he is.

04:21.927 --> 04:22.762
- Come on.
- I would just like

04:22.928 --> 04:24.265
a normal handshake.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.349
- I'm not really good at...
- You did great.

04:26.515 --> 04:27.936
Oh.

04:28.061 --> 04:30.186
Bartender, may we have
two scotches here?

04:30.352 --> 04:31.973
Wow, all right, mid-day scotches.

04:32.098 --> 04:33.899
I like it.
It's been a while.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.734
Dude, what's going on?
How's the firm?

04:35.900 --> 04:36.945
She's a bitch,

04:37.070 --> 04:38.278
but she knows I like it rough.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.237
- Yeah.
- Oh, you know what,

04:39.403 --> 04:40.482
we are back in court

04:40.607 --> 04:41.573
with your old Nemesis.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.783
Gypsum textiles.

04:43.949 --> 04:45.987
Those guys
cannot stop dumping

04:46.112 --> 04:47.037
In the Colorado river, huh?

04:47.203 --> 04:48.997
It's like they hate nature.

04:49.163 --> 04:50.665
Yeah, I got depositions
all afternoon.

04:50.831 --> 04:53.161
Oh. Wow.

04:53.286 --> 04:55.697
Man, I do not... do not miss those.

04:55.822 --> 04:57.505
Really?
You were always so good at it.

04:57.671 --> 04:58.967
Oh, here we go.
Thank you.

04:59.092 --> 05:00.258
Cheers.

05:03.763 --> 05:04.973
- You mind if I take a quick...
- Oh, no.

05:05.098 --> 05:06.014
Yeah.

05:08.601 --> 05:09.894
How's your day going?

05:10.019 --> 05:11.045
Oh, hey, honey.

05:11.170 --> 05:12.764
Oh, you are going
to be so proud of me.

05:12.889 --> 05:13.813
Check this out.

05:13.979 --> 05:15.023
Check. This. Out.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.316
Okay, look at this junk drawer.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.068
It's kind of a misnomer now,
isn't it?

05:18.234 --> 05:19.819
Because there's
absolutely no junk in there.

05:19.985 --> 05:21.780
I mean, now we just call it drawer.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.692
- Yup.
- Reagan, are you in need

05:23.817 --> 05:25.110
of some sort of medical attention?

05:25.235 --> 05:26.995
No, I'm just excited
about being domesticated

05:27.120 --> 05:28.036
and stuff.
Check this out.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.165
Look at this new system I have

05:30.290 --> 05:31.623
for folding Amy's laundry.

05:31.789 --> 05:32.874
And, wow, that's a lot of wine

05:33.040 --> 05:34.167
you're pouring there, honey.

05:34.333 --> 05:35.293
Are you okay?

05:35.459 --> 05:37.337
I just left Kevin and that daughter.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.257
I couldn't make a connection.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.575
I hate saying this
about a little girl,

05:40.700 --> 05:42.425
but she's a real butt.

05:42.591 --> 05:44.219
- Ava.
- With two ts.

05:44.385 --> 05:45.512
McKenna is a butt.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.806
Honey, this has got
to be very difficult for her.

05:47.972 --> 05:50.018
You are the new woman
in her father's life.

05:50.143 --> 05:51.226
It's very threatening.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.471
It's true.
I'm a quadruple threat.

05:53.596 --> 05:56.064
I sing, I act,
I dance, I replace mothers.

05:56.230 --> 05:57.357
She's actually very sweet.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.810
You know her.

05:58.935 --> 06:00.612
Maybe you can help make
a breakthrough.

06:00.737 --> 06:02.070
We have a lunch date tomorrow.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.154
You want me and Chris to come?

06:03.320 --> 06:05.448
- Thank you.
- Okay.

06:05.614 --> 06:07.102
I like Kevin so much.
He's so real,

06:07.227 --> 06:10.787
and the calluses
on his hands are so rough.

06:10.953 --> 06:13.742
When he touches me, I feel
as though I'm being sandblasted.

06:13.867 --> 06:15.376
We're coming.
We're coming.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.328
- Okay?
- Hey, what's up, ladies?

06:17.453 --> 06:18.962
- Hi.
- So...

06:19.128 --> 06:21.089
- Hi, honey.
- How's the relaxing time going?

06:21.255 --> 06:23.008
A-mazing.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.952
You, my darling, are going
to be so proud

06:25.077 --> 06:27.639
of how I started to rock this house.

06:27.764 --> 06:29.639
It's so much better.

06:29.805 --> 06:32.177
Oh, yeah.
Was it bad before?

06:32.302 --> 06:33.595
No.
No, it wasn't bad.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.479
It's just not as good as it is now.

06:36.645 --> 06:41.359
May I present to you
Amy's laundry 2.0.

06:41.525 --> 06:43.319
- You gap-folded everything.
- Yeah.

06:43.485 --> 06:45.697
The way you were folding it
was, like, leaving a crease.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.475
At first I thought it was OCD.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.742
You know, like Howie Mandel.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.495
Right. So you folded
all of Amy's socks too?

06:52.661 --> 06:54.982
Yeah, I mean,
I like your balling method,

06:55.107 --> 06:56.701
but it's just kind of messy.

06:56.826 --> 06:57.876
So I just think folding's nicer.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.587
Oh, is it nicer?

06:59.712 --> 07:01.539
Okay, well, you know, I ball 'em up

07:01.664 --> 07:03.124
like that so they stay together,

07:03.249 --> 07:04.466
and, that way, they match too.

07:04.632 --> 07:05.717
Okay.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.093
Show him the new junk drawer.

07:07.259 --> 07:09.596
Oh, did you touch the junk drawer?

07:09.762 --> 07:11.666
'Cause I distinctly remember
saying something

07:11.791 --> 07:15.103
along the lines of "leave it alone."

07:15.228 --> 07:17.228
Yup. "I like it that way."
Remember that?

07:17.394 --> 07:18.773
- It's better.
- Wow.

07:18.898 --> 07:20.375
You keep using the word "better".

07:20.500 --> 07:22.859
And it's not really a big deal...

07:23.025 --> 07:24.652
It's a drawer and some laundry.

07:24.818 --> 07:25.730
- Okay?
- Right.

07:25.855 --> 07:27.699
See, thing is
about your revolutionary

07:27.824 --> 07:30.652
folding method is that,
just the slightest shake-up

07:30.777 --> 07:32.704
or slip, and, oh, no, we are left

07:32.829 --> 07:34.287
with a tedious hellscape
of unmatched socks.

07:34.453 --> 07:35.690
But when you ball them up,

07:35.815 --> 07:37.392
they stay together like this.

07:37.517 --> 07:40.335
You get to do fun things like this.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.464
Oh, that is fun.
It is fun.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.590
But if you fold it,

07:45.756 --> 07:49.469
then you can do stuff like this.

07:49.635 --> 07:50.970
Hmm?

07:52.263 --> 07:53.139
That's true.

07:53.305 --> 07:54.642
But then again

07:54.767 --> 07:57.595
you get to do things like this.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.687
Oh.
Unfolding them.

07:59.853 --> 08:01.149
Well, those are falling flat.

08:01.274 --> 08:03.191
You can't get any air.
But I can just keep doing that.

08:03.357 --> 08:05.987
No, see... oh, my God.

08:06.112 --> 08:07.529
These don't match.
But now they do.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.489
- Rapid-fire.
- That feels good.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.225
That's like a little massage
of baby socks.

08:11.350 --> 08:12.617
I have way more... many more socks

08:12.783 --> 08:13.827
because they're not in balls.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.662
Never gonna stop.

08:15.828 --> 08:19.290
You two, your lovemaking
must be so playful.

08:19.456 --> 08:21.903
That feels good.
That actually feels really good.

08:22.028 --> 08:24.478
- You see what I can do there?
- Yeah.

08:26.408 --> 08:27.616
So, McKenna.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.586
How do you like your new doll?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.303
My doll died.

08:32.469 --> 08:34.514
Now, honey, are you sure
she's not just sleeping?

08:34.679 --> 08:36.192
No.
It's dead.

08:36.317 --> 08:37.643
They sell everything else here,

08:37.768 --> 08:39.645
maybe they sell
baby doll coffins too.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.563
- No?
- McKenna, come on.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.065
I'm sorry.
She's not usually like this.

08:44.231 --> 08:45.400
Help me.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.937
How about the three of us girls

08:48.062 --> 08:49.195
go over to the candy section

08:49.361 --> 08:52.115
and we just eat hot tamales
until we freak out?

08:52.281 --> 08:53.810
- What do you say? Yeah?
- Yay.

08:53.935 --> 08:55.812
- Sounds fun!
- Come on, let's go.

08:55.937 --> 08:57.245
- Fun!
- Okay.

09:00.205 --> 09:02.250
So, uh, this is nice,
right, you guys?

09:02.416 --> 09:04.587
Yeah, you know, I mean, Ava, she's...

09:04.712 --> 09:05.753
Well, she's amazing.

09:05.919 --> 09:07.547
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.507
McKenna's not really making it
easy, though.

09:09.673 --> 09:12.028
It's tough.

09:12.153 --> 09:15.164
It is tough.

09:15.289 --> 09:16.681
What's... what's with the low voice?

09:16.847 --> 09:18.433
I don't know. Just feeling
kind of competitive.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.226
- What, with me vocally?
- Yeah.

09:20.392 --> 09:22.478
Yeah. I get it.
It's very hypnotic.

09:22.644 --> 09:24.607
It is hypnotic.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.009
Uh-oh.
Looks like somebody made a mess.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.011
I'm gonna get you cleaned up.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.445
Oh, no.

09:30.611 --> 09:32.155
Oh, my God.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.950
Oh, Reagan got to my diaper bag.

09:34.075 --> 09:35.518
I keep the wipes in the main part

09:35.643 --> 09:37.153
'cause, if you try
to jam 'em in the front,

09:37.278 --> 09:39.288
then they just... the lid pops open,

09:39.413 --> 09:41.289
- and then what do you got?
- Dry wipes.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.416
These things are not supposed
to be exposed to air, you know.

09:43.582 --> 09:44.792
Diaper time's tough enough

09:44.958 --> 09:46.169
without somebody jacking up
your wipes.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.914
Reagan's going back
to work in three days.

09:48.039 --> 09:50.673
I just got to keep it together
till then.

09:50.839 --> 09:53.402
You know what,
you're doing good, bro.

09:53.527 --> 09:55.053
Just stay strong.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.179
You're doing the voice thing again.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.264
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

09:58.430 --> 10:00.309
You know what always amazes me?

10:00.434 --> 10:03.262
Is how many gummi objects
that they have.

10:03.387 --> 10:06.231
The Germans pronounce it goomee.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.900
Hey, McKenna, what's your
favorite subject in school?

10:09.066 --> 10:10.526
Uh, science.

10:10.692 --> 10:11.569
Really?

10:11.735 --> 10:14.280
And I also like music, I guess.

10:14.446 --> 10:15.990
Did you know that Ava's a musician?

10:16.156 --> 10:17.927
Well, I had a couple of R&B hits.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.328
And one crossover.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.265
It was a country duet
with Kenny Rogers.

10:22.390 --> 10:23.866
I'm really big in the red states.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.292
Whenever I go to Branson,
I need a huge security detail.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.338
I have to sing at this recital
at my school.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.339
I don't want to do it.

10:30.464 --> 10:33.342
Oh.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.044
What?

10:35.169 --> 10:36.579
You don't have to sing.

10:36.704 --> 10:37.929
I'll go to your school,
and I'll sing for you.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.973
No, what I was thinking,

10:40.139 --> 10:42.225
Ava, is that you could mentor
McKenna.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.394
You know, give her some tips, huh?

10:44.560 --> 10:47.063
Yes.
McKenna, I would love

10:47.229 --> 10:49.816
to help you if you want.

10:49.982 --> 10:52.395
You could spend the afternoon
in my music room.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.153
That could be fun.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.366
Okay.

10:57.491 --> 11:00.535
Yes.
Thank you.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.104
Okay, hon, you were sampling before.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.079
Now you're just stealing.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.507
Oh, my God, I don't think

11:04.632 --> 11:07.000
the whole [Bleep] Doll store
just heard you.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.209
What are those?

11:08.375 --> 11:09.669
Those are my gold records.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.337
They're like Olympic medals?

11:11.503 --> 11:13.683
Better.
Because I won them for things

11:13.808 --> 11:16.592
people really care about...
Music and sales.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.185
Can we just get real for a sec here?

11:21.847 --> 11:24.193
I really like your dad,

11:24.318 --> 11:27.520
and I want to help you
so that he'll like me back.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.565
I know you like him,
'cause, when you're around him,

11:29.690 --> 11:30.857
you get a sweat mustache.

11:32.733 --> 11:33.735
Yeah.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.361
Well, come on.

11:35.527 --> 11:37.697
Let me hear your song.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.692
All right.

11:39.817 --> 11:41.534
Stand over here.
Okay.

11:43.738 --> 11:46.039
♪ Oh, when the saints,
oh, when the saints ♪

11:46.205 --> 11:48.541
♪ go marching in,
go marching in ♪

11:48.707 --> 11:51.252
♪ oh, when the saints
go marching in ♪

11:52.711 --> 11:54.922
Horrible, right?

11:55.088 --> 11:56.158
No, no.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.925
There's little things we can do.

11:58.091 --> 11:59.562
I stink.

11:59.687 --> 12:00.997
I'm gonna make a fool of myself.

12:01.122 --> 12:02.221
You wouldn't understand.

12:02.387 --> 12:05.034
Oh, no?

12:05.159 --> 12:06.969
I'd like to show you something.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.396
Please escort me
to my apple home computer.

12:26.537 --> 12:27.872
Oh!

12:39.383 --> 12:41.053
Dude, I mean, not to be rude,

12:41.178 --> 12:42.672
but where did you get
your law degree?

12:42.797 --> 12:44.263
Dillweed university?

12:44.429 --> 12:46.442
Hey, ever since you took
your permanent vacation,

12:46.567 --> 12:47.725
I've been carrying
twice the workload.

12:47.891 --> 12:49.445
Yes, I know.
Which is why I went

12:49.570 --> 12:51.646
to my home office
and I whipped you up this.

12:51.812 --> 12:52.882
- You wrote me a brief?
- Yeah.

12:53.007 --> 12:54.016
- And it's really good.
- Oh.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.191
I could kiss you on the lips.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.901
I don't think
you have the guts to do it.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.270
You better think about it now

12:58.395 --> 12:59.488
'cause here comes that kiss.

12:59.613 --> 13:00.905
- You ready for it?
- Do it.

13:01.071 --> 13:01.924
- It's gonna happen.
- Do it.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.893
Dude, come back to the firm.

13:04.018 --> 13:06.369
We need you.

13:06.535 --> 13:07.896
I know.
I know.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.498
I know. I know.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.167
I know.
I know.

13:11.292 --> 13:13.736
All right.
All righty.

13:13.861 --> 13:16.238
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.340
It's gonna be so much better.

13:17.465 --> 13:19.966
Yes.
Oh, hey, hi.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.101
'Sup?

13:24.177 --> 13:25.346
Hey!

13:25.973 --> 13:27.249
What are you doing there?

13:27.374 --> 13:28.683
I'm just cleaning up a little bit,

13:28.849 --> 13:31.394
'cause your weeds
were getting a little crazy.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.187
I can take care of my own lawn.

13:33.353 --> 13:36.441
Oh, I know you can, but you don't.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.777
- So...
- I need you

13:37.902 --> 13:39.068
to get off my property.

13:39.234 --> 13:40.236
I'm actually in the street, sir.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.487
Go on.
Get out of here.

13:41.653 --> 13:42.481
If you're saying, "go on.

13:42.606 --> 13:43.948
Get out of here," to these weeds,

13:44.114 --> 13:45.151
then that is
what is gonna happen to them,

13:45.276 --> 13:46.619
because you got to trust me
on this, okay?

13:46.744 --> 13:48.270
I have a vision.
This is so much better.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.412
Okay, okay.

13:49.578 --> 13:50.539
You don't need to wave that at me.

13:50.664 --> 13:51.774
All right.
Okay. Okay.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.293
I'm out.
I'm out.

13:54.418 --> 13:55.918
Buh-bye now.

13:56.084 --> 13:57.211
Buh-bye.

13:57.377 --> 13:59.505
No harm in taking a few of these.

14:01.965 --> 14:03.335
All right.
Buh-bye now.

14:03.460 --> 14:04.744
Okay.

14:09.095 --> 14:10.475
No.

14:15.919 --> 14:17.398
Hey, honey.

14:17.564 --> 14:20.193
Just got back from a nice walk
with Amy.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.083
Why is Brendan Shanahan
in the garbage?

14:22.208 --> 14:23.384
Because Brendan Shanahan

14:23.509 --> 14:24.803
was blocking
an air-conditioning vent.

14:24.928 --> 14:26.521
- So...
- We just saw Len.

14:26.646 --> 14:28.690
We thought he was having
another heart attack.

14:28.815 --> 14:29.994
Reagan, what did you do to Len?

14:30.160 --> 14:32.126
I didn't do anything to Len.

14:32.251 --> 14:35.029
Oh, my God, you cut Len's weeds.

14:35.154 --> 14:36.664
Why is it such a big deal?

14:36.789 --> 14:39.295
Come on, guys.
So I cut a crazy guy's weeds.

14:39.461 --> 14:42.003
He lost a toe at war.

14:42.128 --> 14:44.717
If it wasn't for him, we'd all
be speaking Korean right now.

14:44.883 --> 14:46.219
Oh, give me a break, Terry.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.744
I'm gene.

14:49.869 --> 14:53.601
Oh...

14:53.767 --> 14:56.201
Although, babe, I did ask you
to drop the Len thing.

14:56.326 --> 14:58.147
I don't know why you just...
You won't let things go.

14:58.313 --> 14:59.273
Amen, brother.

14:59.439 --> 15:02.568
Finally.
She's a bossy pants.

15:02.734 --> 15:05.093
Yeah. Yeah.

15:05.218 --> 15:06.594
Babe, did you see
what just happened there?

15:06.719 --> 15:08.741
I almost high-fived gene.

15:08.907 --> 15:11.099
This is my worst nightmare
come true on stage.

15:11.224 --> 15:13.025
I've never even watched it.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.771
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- I was performing

15:16.896 --> 15:18.209
at a fundraiser in front of

15:18.375 --> 15:19.961
the President of the United States.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.004
Mr. President.

15:22.170 --> 15:24.195
I had performed live
hundreds of times,

15:24.320 --> 15:26.698
but never in front
of so many statesmen

15:26.823 --> 15:28.469
and stars of stage and screen.

Oh, God, Antonio Banderas.

15:56.455 --> 15:57.612
There's nothing more painful
than scorn

15:57.737 --> 15:58.833
from a golden globe nominee.

16:02.669 --> 16:04.338
You know, you're being
a real butt right now.

16:04.504 --> 16:06.632
I'm sorry.

16:06.798 --> 16:08.940
That was the most embarrassing thing

16:09.065 --> 16:11.459
that's ever happened to anyone,
and I'm still standing here

16:11.584 --> 16:14.348
in what I'm told is a Hollywood
regency-style drawing room.

16:14.514 --> 16:17.832
You see, performing is only
a little bit about talent.

16:17.957 --> 16:20.187
It's all about facing your fear.

16:20.353 --> 16:22.356
If you don't want to perform,
then don't.

16:22.522 --> 16:24.906
But if you want to do it,

16:25.031 --> 16:27.820
then please don't back out
because you're afraid.

16:30.103 --> 16:31.379
- I want to do it.
- Great.

16:31.504 --> 16:35.870
I was hoping you would say that
after that wonderful speech.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.747
It's all so different.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.540
You don't sit there.
You're always there.

16:39.706 --> 16:42.001
And what... what were you gonna do
with this box of Amy's things?

16:42.167 --> 16:43.424
You would just get rid of it
like you did

16:43.549 --> 16:46.380
with Brendan Shanahan?
I mean, babe, Shanny?

16:46.546 --> 16:47.715
I'm just trying to help.

16:47.881 --> 16:48.947
I came home to get changed,

16:49.072 --> 16:51.052
and my closet is unrecognizable.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.554
My pants are where
my cas shirts used to be.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.137
And what gives you the right
to go to my side of the closet

16:56.262 --> 16:58.851
and install a tie robot
that I can't even work?

16:59.017 --> 17:00.311
Push the button three times.

17:00.477 --> 17:04.190
Oh, my God, did you rearrange
the power strips?

17:04.356 --> 17:06.317
That was about to burst into flames.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.950
In my mind.
But honestly I really don't know

17:09.075 --> 17:10.029
what the big deal is.

17:10.194 --> 17:13.074
It's all cause of this.

17:14.547 --> 17:15.826
Am I being subpoenaed?

17:15.992 --> 17:18.291
Oh, God, I should have known.

17:18.416 --> 17:19.894
I was helping Dave with his case,

17:20.019 --> 17:23.131
and it was terrific,
and I just....

17:23.256 --> 17:24.669
Babe, I'm a really good lawyer.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.001
What are you saying, Chris?

17:27.126 --> 17:28.836
You want to go back to work?

17:28.961 --> 17:31.906
No.
But not because I couldn't

17:32.031 --> 17:34.909
or that they don't want me to,
but because...

17:35.034 --> 17:36.344
I do this now.

17:36.469 --> 17:37.578
And I love this.

17:37.703 --> 17:40.748
And this is my identity.

17:40.873 --> 17:43.354
And you got to let me have this.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.523
And I'm not perfect,

17:45.689 --> 17:47.956
and the garden that is all of
this is gonna have some flowers

17:48.081 --> 17:49.490
and it's gonna have
some weeds, and I know

17:49.615 --> 17:51.559
that it's gonna drive you crazy
sometimes, babe,

17:51.684 --> 17:54.495
but you got to let me have my weeds.

17:54.620 --> 17:56.075
Okay?

17:56.241 --> 17:59.203
I'm so sorry, honey.

17:59.369 --> 18:02.170
You are doing such a great job.

18:02.295 --> 18:04.875
- Am I?
- No, you are amazing.

18:05.041 --> 18:07.275
And that metaphor with the garden,

18:07.400 --> 18:09.677
- that's really...
- I knew there was something

18:09.802 --> 18:12.547
in there with Len
and the weeds and stuff...

18:12.672 --> 18:14.218
No, I got that.
It was good.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.717
Really good.

18:15.842 --> 18:19.353
The way you came over there
and just dropped the documents

18:19.478 --> 18:24.478
down on the table, it was
just very Atticus Finch, honey.

18:26.652 --> 18:27.762
I'm not kidding when I say

18:27.887 --> 18:29.567
that is the greatest thing
you can say to a lawyer.

18:32.944 --> 18:35.197
- Where are you going?
- Going over here.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.670
Thank you.

18:49.836 --> 18:51.672
You're welcome.

18:52.912 --> 18:54.439
I'm so nervous.

18:54.564 --> 18:57.325
That's because you're
about to do something great.

18:57.450 --> 18:59.460

for your lawn and especially
for what you and your brethren

did on that cold Korean peninsula

Chris, he's dead.
I've killed him.

21:12.062 --> 21:14.398
I was just resting my eyes.

21:14.564 --> 21:16.506
I'm sorry.
