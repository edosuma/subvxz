00:01.437 --> 00:05.205
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

00:05.207 --> 00:07.841
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

00:07.843 --> 00:10.877
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

00:10.879 --> 00:12.345
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

00:12.347 --> 00:14.781
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

00:14.783 --> 00:17.818
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

00:17.820 --> 00:20.220
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

00:20.222 --> 00:22.054
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

00:22.056 --> 00:25.758
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

00:27.161 --> 00:31.130
<i>Previously
on "Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

00:31.132 --> 00:33.032
<i>The flashes
I've been having...</i>

00:33.034 --> 00:34.601
<i>they're of Carter.</i>

00:34.603 --> 00:36.102
It must be really weird

00:36.104 --> 00:37.937
feeling like you're
cheating on me with him.

00:37.939 --> 00:39.205
No, Ray,

00:39.207 --> 00:41.841
I feel like I'm cheating on him

00:41.843 --> 00:44.343
with you.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.846
We need to move swiftly
to locate Vandal Savage.

00:46.848 --> 00:50.216
There is one place in time
that we know Savage to be.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.917
2166.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.720
We have, quite literally,
run out of time.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.196 --> 01:04.629
Oh!
We're gonna need to find

01:04.632 --> 01:06.531
a safe place to set down,
Gideon.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.933
<i>I don't believe there are
any safe places, Captain.</i>

01:08.935 --> 01:10.802
Are we over London yet?

01:10.804 --> 01:13.371
- What's left of it.
- Why's London shooting at us?

01:13.373 --> 01:15.539
It's Savage's forces
that are doing the shooting.

01:15.541 --> 01:18.309
Here in 2166, they've subjugated
most of the globe.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.715
Maybe picking up here
wasn't the brightest idea.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.417
Unfortunately,
we no longer have the luxury

01:26.419 --> 01:28.653
of blindly searching
for Savage throughout history.

01:28.655 --> 01:30.554
Indeed;
we have to target Savage

01:30.556 --> 01:33.391
at the time and place that we're
certain he will be, which is...

01:33.393 --> 01:36.527
Right before
he wastes your family.

01:36.529 --> 01:37.961
What?

01:37.963 --> 01:40.331
Yes, Mr. Rory,
Savage will kill my wife and son

01:40.333 --> 01:43.967
in three days' time, but we can
save them and the world

01:43.969 --> 01:46.003
by stopping Savage now.

01:50.375 --> 01:53.143
<i>Captain, I've managed to slip
beneath their artillery fire.</i>

01:53.145 --> 01:55.345
Set us down on the outskirts
of the city, Gideon,

01:55.347 --> 01:58.348
near the encampment of the
remaining resistance forces.

01:58.350 --> 02:00.350
We are going to need
to proceed swiftly.

02:00.352 --> 02:01.851
I realize your family
is in jeopardy,

02:01.853 --> 02:03.186
but perhaps some deliberation...

02:03.188 --> 02:05.488
We really don't have the time,
Martin.

02:05.490 --> 02:07.056
According to Gideon,
Savage is going to be

02:07.058 --> 02:10.126
out in the open tonight...
vulnerable.

02:10.127 --> 02:12.295
Now, in order to capture him,

02:12.297 --> 02:13.697
I require the services of...

02:13.699 --> 02:15.865
A killer, klepto, and pyro?

02:15.867 --> 02:17.666
Bingo.

02:17.668 --> 02:22.104
Here we stand
at the edge of history.

02:22.106 --> 02:24.006
But as tempting as it might be

02:24.008 --> 02:27.877
to celebrate
our previous victories,

02:27.879 --> 02:31.147
it is only for the next
and final battle

02:31.149 --> 02:33.281
that you will be remembered.

02:33.283 --> 02:35.217
There's no way
we can grab him here.

02:35.219 --> 02:37.419
Not with an army
standing between us.

02:37.421 --> 02:40.422
Shh, I'm trying
to listen to this guy.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.958
He gives a hell of a speech.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.293
Onward to victory!

02:47.064 --> 02:50.065
Onward to immortality!

02:53.270 --> 02:55.270
Present arms!

02:55.272 --> 02:56.504
Quick time. Move!

02:56.506 --> 02:58.373
<i>All set on our end.</i>

02:58.375 --> 03:01.109
Jax is in the Jumpship,
ready to extract you guys.

03:01.111 --> 03:03.879
Especially if...
and by if, I mean when...

03:03.881 --> 03:05.780
this thing goes south.

03:12.856 --> 03:15.890
Savage's lady friend
just made us.

03:15.892 --> 03:17.358
Have faith, Mr. Snart.

03:24.267 --> 03:27.167
Gideon, push in on the woman.

03:30.839 --> 03:32.672
That bracelet she's wearing...

03:32.674 --> 03:34.508
can you get a clearer image?

03:43.151 --> 03:44.484
Oh, my God.

03:48.990 --> 03:51.425
If we don't move real soon,
we could get ourselves killed.

03:51.427 --> 03:53.493
How about we play this
like Chicago?

03:53.495 --> 03:54.661
Could work.

03:56.531 --> 03:57.830
Ugh!

03:57.832 --> 04:00.266
What the hell
did you do that for?

04:05.706 --> 04:08.474
We'll take Savage.
You tie up the guards.

04:37.404 --> 04:39.871
Sara,
the woman you're fighting...

04:39.873 --> 04:41.573
<i>you need to take her bracelet.</i>

04:43.010 --> 04:45.209
Are you seriously
jewelry shopping right now?

04:49.282 --> 04:51.783
We're outnumbered.

04:51.785 --> 04:53.317
Fall back!

04:56.089 --> 04:57.355
Mr. Jackson,

04:57.357 --> 04:59.390
now would be a good time
to pick us up.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.574
What exactly do you think
you were doing back there?

05:17.576 --> 05:19.643
Distracting Savage's pals,

05:19.645 --> 05:21.211
which worked, by the way.

05:21.213 --> 05:22.445
Yes, well,
I could've been killed.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.180
Never said
it worked perfectly.

05:24.182 --> 05:25.516
At least it wasn't
a complete bust.

05:25.518 --> 05:28.785
We found out
about Kendra's bracelet.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.153
What bracelet?

05:31.891 --> 05:35.158
My bracelet... I was wearing it
the night of my first death.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.893
That's great.

05:36.895 --> 05:39.262
Not the death part.
That's terrible.

05:39.264 --> 05:40.563
But you told us
that objects

05:40.565 --> 05:41.831
present on the night
of your death

05:41.833 --> 05:43.466
can be used to kill Savage.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.068
You're my fiancÃ©e.
I listen to you.

05:45.070 --> 05:46.436
And that's sweet,

05:46.438 --> 05:48.371
but there's still
one small problem.

05:48.373 --> 05:51.106
It's a bracelet; how are you
supposed to kill Savage with it?

05:51.108 --> 05:53.375
A question we will answer
the moment we have obtained it.

05:53.377 --> 05:55.244
We need our resident
kleptomaniacs

05:55.246 --> 05:56.679
to steal that bracelet.

05:56.681 --> 05:58.681
<i>Captain,
I've detected movement</i>

05:58.683 --> 06:02.084
<i>300 meters southwest
of our position and closing.</i>

06:02.086 --> 06:03.553
- Savage's army?
- <i>Negative.</i>

06:03.555 --> 06:04.987
<i>I believe they are
all that remains</i>

06:04.989 --> 06:06.488
<i>of the resistance forces.</i>

06:06.490 --> 06:07.789
I'm going to make contact
with them.

06:07.791 --> 06:09.558
They might have
information on Savage

06:09.560 --> 06:11.226
that we can use
to our advantage.

06:11.228 --> 06:14.363
In the meantime, Ms. Lance,
get Ms. Saunders ready.

06:14.365 --> 06:16.031
Ray.

06:16.033 --> 06:17.566
How am I supposed
to teach someone to fight

06:17.568 --> 06:18.667
with a piece of jewelry?

06:18.669 --> 06:19.868
Good question.

06:19.870 --> 06:21.636
It wasn't rhetorical.

06:26.877 --> 06:28.476
Thank you, gentlemen,

06:28.478 --> 06:30.579
for accompanying me
on this excursion.

06:30.581 --> 06:32.313
Oh, no problem.

06:32.315 --> 06:33.715
I just love hiking
through the woods

06:33.717 --> 06:35.083
in the middle
of World War III.

06:35.085 --> 06:36.217
What if,
instead of encountering

06:36.219 --> 06:37.652
these resistance fighters,

06:37.654 --> 06:40.055
we meet up with more
of Savage's forces?

06:40.057 --> 06:41.556
Why else do you think
I brought along

06:41.558 --> 06:43.224
Firestorm and The Atom?

06:47.097 --> 06:48.563
Give me one good reason
why we shouldn't

06:48.565 --> 06:49.997
blow you straight to hell.

06:49.999 --> 06:53.134
Better yet, give her
several good reasons.

06:53.136 --> 06:57.071
My wife and son
live in Whitechapel.

06:57.073 --> 06:59.640
- It was hit hard.
- I know.

06:59.642 --> 07:03.510
The same fate will befall you
if you don't accept our help.

07:03.512 --> 07:05.512
How do we know
you're not with Savage?

07:05.514 --> 07:08.148
Because if we were,
you'd be dead right now.

07:08.150 --> 07:10.918
Look, feel free to shoot us,
but from the looks of it,

07:10.920 --> 07:13.587
you could use all the allies
you can get.

07:17.626 --> 07:20.327
Whitechapel fell 11 days ago.

07:20.329 --> 07:22.295
We have a lot of refugees.

07:22.297 --> 07:24.697
You think your wife and son
are among them?

07:24.699 --> 07:27.501
Sadly, I'm confident
that they're not.

07:27.503 --> 07:30.469
Still, we would like to help
in whatever way we can.

07:30.471 --> 07:32.605
Very well;
get yourselves acclimated,

07:32.607 --> 07:34.140
and I'll rejoin you shortly.

07:42.450 --> 07:43.950
Hey.

07:52.893 --> 07:55.961
Uh, I would've brought more,
but...

07:59.467 --> 08:01.033
Jefferson.

08:01.035 --> 08:02.468
Jefferson, let's...

08:02.470 --> 08:04.269
let's return to the ship,

08:04.271 --> 08:07.806
and we'll bring back
those additional provisions.

08:07.808 --> 08:09.407
Don't worry.

08:09.409 --> 08:12.944
There's plenty more
where that came from.

08:12.946 --> 08:14.445
We'll be back.

08:15.549 --> 08:18.817
So what did you mean
back there,

08:18.819 --> 08:19.984
about your family?

08:19.986 --> 08:21.586
I'd rather not
discuss it.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.588
Yeah, I picked up on that.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.657
I also picked up on the fact
that we're in London

08:25.659 --> 08:28.993
just a few days before Savage
tries to kill your wife and son,

08:28.995 --> 08:32.297
and you're not trying
to get them to safety.

08:34.267 --> 08:36.767
After my first attempt
on Savage in Ancient Egypt,

08:36.769 --> 08:41.172
my very next stop
was here in 2166.

08:41.174 --> 08:43.273
I found Miranda and Jonas
exactly where I'd left them,

08:43.275 --> 08:46.643
and we... we raced
towards the Waverider,

08:46.645 --> 08:54.017
but we had a run-in
with Savage's shocktroopers.

08:54.019 --> 08:56.453
Miranda and Jonas
were cut down.

09:00.792 --> 09:04.595
So I jumped even further back,

09:04.597 --> 09:08.732
and the outcome
was exactly the same.

09:10.635 --> 09:13.903
I watched my family die
countless times

09:13.905 --> 09:16.339
at the hands of Savage
and his forces

09:16.341 --> 09:20.643
before I realized that...

09:20.645 --> 09:22.879
Time wants to happen.

09:25.950 --> 09:28.150
Funny feeling knowing
that the universe itself

09:28.152 --> 09:32.054
doesn't want you
to save your family.

09:32.056 --> 09:34.056
All right,
what are you all playing at?

09:34.058 --> 09:35.658
I retina-scanned
the four of you.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.059
There's no record of you
anywhere,

09:37.061 --> 09:40.129
and you and your friends
disappeared 150 years ago.

09:40.131 --> 09:41.830
Believe me
when I tell you

09:41.832 --> 09:43.065
it would take
about that much time

09:43.067 --> 09:44.233
for us to tell the whole story.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.834
But the most important thing

09:45.836 --> 09:47.736
is that we get as close
to Vandal Savage as possible.

09:47.738 --> 09:50.372
No one gets close to Savage,
especially not now.

09:50.374 --> 09:53.575
Some idiots made an attempt
on his life earlier tonight.

09:53.577 --> 09:55.277
He's gone to ground
in the citadel's bunker

09:55.279 --> 09:56.945
and he's holed up
good and tight.

09:56.947 --> 09:59.347
<i>Delta Camp is under attack.
Taking heavy fire.</i>

09:59.349 --> 10:00.749
<i>We need air support.</i>

10:00.751 --> 10:02.417
Where's Delta Camp?

10:05.455 --> 10:07.322
Establish a perimeter!

10:07.324 --> 10:10.892
Once it's secure,
we'll search for survivors.

10:10.894 --> 10:13.461
Last week, Savage's forces
laid waste to Tokyo.

10:13.463 --> 10:16.363
London is the last patch
of free ground on the planet.

10:16.365 --> 10:17.965
Savage's armies have cut down

10:17.967 --> 10:20.902
the most formidable militaries
in the world.

10:20.904 --> 10:23.805
What do you men think you can do
against an evil like this?

10:40.662 --> 10:42.285
There were no survivors
from the attack.

10:42.287 --> 10:44.142
No, whatever weapon
Savage used against the rebels

10:44.144 --> 10:46.628
was quite effective.

10:46.630 --> 10:48.562
Maybe Professor Stein and I
should survey the wreckage,

10:48.564 --> 10:49.964
analyze some soil samples,

10:49.966 --> 10:52.199
determine what kind of weaponry
Savage is using.

10:52.201 --> 10:54.101
Until we figure out a way
to thwart his firepower,

10:54.103 --> 10:55.336
the rebels are
as good as dead.

10:55.338 --> 10:56.570
But remember
why we're here:

10:56.572 --> 10:59.140
to stop Savage,
not to slow him down.

10:59.142 --> 11:01.809
Do we have a plan
for stealing this bracelet?

11:01.811 --> 11:02.977
We're on it.

11:02.979 --> 11:04.245
Please don't tell me
the plan

11:04.247 --> 11:05.646
is to walk
into Savage's citadel

11:05.648 --> 11:06.947
and steal it off her wrist.

11:06.949 --> 11:09.783
All right,
I won't tell you that.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.286
All right,
well, we still have the issue

11:13.288 --> 11:16.122
of how to turn a piece
of jewelry into a lethal weapon.

11:16.124 --> 11:18.158
Perhaps there is reference
to the bracelet

11:18.160 --> 11:20.861
in Professor Boardman's diary.

11:20.863 --> 11:22.662
I doubt it.

11:22.664 --> 11:25.898
I've read through my son's
research a thousand times.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.668
Savage has
devastating weapon

11:28.670 --> 11:32.805
at his command, and here now,
at the eleventh hour,

11:32.807 --> 11:36.509
we could sorely use
a weapon of our own.

11:36.511 --> 11:38.310
I'll look into it.

11:40.181 --> 11:42.247
This is such a waste of time.

11:42.249 --> 11:44.416
I've already looked through
every single page

11:44.418 --> 11:46.118
of Aldus' notebooks.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.954
If he had written something
specific about the bracelet

11:47.956 --> 11:50.523
and killing Savage,
I would have known it already.

11:53.728 --> 11:54.994
Here it is.

12:00.034 --> 12:01.867
You ever think about him?

12:01.869 --> 12:05.337
Carter?

12:05.339 --> 12:07.039
I try not to.

12:07.041 --> 12:09.641
It's not like
I'll ever see him again.

12:09.643 --> 12:12.544
Not in this lifetime, anyway.

12:12.546 --> 12:15.981
Besides, Carter is my past.

12:15.983 --> 12:18.149
Ray is my future.

12:18.151 --> 12:21.386
Still,
4,000-year-long relationship...

12:21.388 --> 12:23.321
seems like it'd be
hard to get over.

12:23.323 --> 12:25.657
Yeah.

12:25.659 --> 12:28.926
Maybe once Savage is gone,
I can finally start to.

12:43.543 --> 12:44.708
Wow.

12:45.611 --> 12:47.778
What's the occasion?

12:47.780 --> 12:52.416
- I'll give you one guess.
- Our anniversary?

12:52.418 --> 12:53.884
Look, I'm sorry,
but in my defense,

12:53.886 --> 12:55.252
there's quite a few of them
to remember.

12:55.254 --> 12:59.623
We were only married in...
eight lifetimes.

12:59.625 --> 13:01.358
That's a lot.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.527
But I do remember

13:03.529 --> 13:05.162
your Victorian England
incarnation

13:05.164 --> 13:07.931
being particularly tough
to be pinned down.

13:11.636 --> 13:13.403
Why are you
handing this to me?

13:13.405 --> 13:14.871
Well,
it's an anniversary gift.

13:14.873 --> 13:16.406
Oh.

13:16.408 --> 13:18.775
You have got to stop giving me
weapons as presents.

13:18.777 --> 13:21.744
I think it's time
you learn how to use it.

13:21.746 --> 13:23.212
But it's your weapon.

13:23.214 --> 13:24.881
Savage has murdered us
countless times,

13:24.883 --> 13:27.016
and we aren't always
lucky enough to die together.

13:27.018 --> 13:29.619
This is awfully depressing
talk for our anniversary,

13:29.621 --> 13:30.587
don't you think?

13:30.589 --> 13:33.122
Kendra, this is important.

13:33.124 --> 13:35.023
I need to know
that if I go first,

13:35.025 --> 13:36.925
you have everything you need
to face him.

13:36.927 --> 13:39.761
I don't want to think
about facing Savage...

13:39.763 --> 13:42.565
or life... without you.

13:50.574 --> 13:52.273
You'll never be without me,

13:52.275 --> 13:53.541
no matter what.

13:53.543 --> 13:55.210
I'll always be near.

13:55.212 --> 13:58.246
Just give it a try.

14:02.786 --> 14:04.119
Who's to say
I'll ever be strong enough

14:04.121 --> 14:06.588
to kill Savage by myself?

14:06.590 --> 14:08.923
Just trust me.

14:08.925 --> 14:10.992
You have everything you need.

14:19.603 --> 14:21.302
What is it?

14:21.304 --> 14:24.005
I think I know what we can use
to kill Savage.

14:43.992 --> 14:45.325
Savage has warned you all

14:45.327 --> 14:47.861
about the radicals
who oppose us.

14:47.863 --> 14:51.165
They will not show you the mercy
I just did.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.066
Dismissed.

14:58.273 --> 15:02.208
I said you're dismissed.

15:06.481 --> 15:09.182
Oh, we thought you said
"missed."

15:09.184 --> 15:11.450
Whoever you are,
you're certainly persistent.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.952
Not really.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.055
We just like
bright, sparkly objects,

15:16.057 --> 15:19.192
like that bracelet.

15:19.194 --> 15:21.527
You'd risk dying
for a bauble?

15:21.529 --> 15:24.997
It works with my outfit.

15:29.503 --> 15:32.171
What now, Mr. Snart?

15:32.173 --> 15:34.106
How do you know my name?

15:40.480 --> 15:42.715
There I was, thinking
we could go a whole week

15:42.717 --> 15:44.349
without kidnapping anyone.

15:44.351 --> 15:45.917
I think you'll find
it would have been better

15:45.919 --> 15:47.151
to simply kill me.

15:47.153 --> 15:48.687
I agree.

15:48.689 --> 15:50.255
It's a little more complicated
than that.

15:50.257 --> 15:52.224
She knew who I was.

15:52.226 --> 15:55.026
I know who all of you are.

15:55.028 --> 15:57.596
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Gareeb.

15:59.032 --> 16:02.734
I see Savage has been rather
chatty with his lieutenants.

16:02.736 --> 16:06.337
If you think I am
merely Savage's soldier,

16:06.339 --> 16:08.606
you're more idiotic
than he claimed.

16:10.443 --> 16:12.910
I'm not his lieutenant.

16:14.313 --> 16:16.114
I'm his daughter.

16:29.648 --> 16:31.515
Vandal Savage
has a daughter?

16:31.517 --> 16:33.884
Apparently it's true.
There's a lid for every pot.

16:33.886 --> 16:36.653
And this lid is gonna be
very upset when he finds out

16:36.655 --> 16:37.987
that we took his pot.

16:39.425 --> 16:40.724
You know what I mean.

16:40.726 --> 16:42.626
So what's the problem?

16:42.628 --> 16:44.728
It's not like we're on Savage's
Christmas card list.

16:44.730 --> 16:46.396
And we snagged the bracelet.

16:46.398 --> 16:47.964
You're welcome, by the way.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.899
We need to weaponize
that thing before Savage knows

16:49.901 --> 16:51.468
that it and his daughter
are missing.

16:51.470 --> 16:54.137
Actually, I think
I've got that figured out.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.539
But I'm gonna need you
to burn something for me.

16:56.541 --> 16:57.740
About time.

16:57.742 --> 16:59.209
We also need to figure out

16:59.211 --> 17:01.077
what we're going to do
with our new guest.

17:01.079 --> 17:02.712
She's seen us and the ship.

17:02.714 --> 17:04.680
If she runs back to Savage,
we're giving him

17:04.682 --> 17:06.015
a huge advantage.

17:06.017 --> 17:07.782
So we make her our advantage.

17:07.785 --> 17:09.886
We send Papa Savage a finger.

17:09.887 --> 17:11.753
And we keep sending them

17:11.756 --> 17:13.989
till he puts his own head
on the chopping block.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.191
That is a positively lurid
idea.

17:16.193 --> 17:17.560
I know we're in the midst
of a war,

17:17.561 --> 17:18.926
but can't we maintain our honor?

17:18.929 --> 17:21.464
I'd rather maintain my life,
Professor.

17:21.465 --> 17:23.866
If she is Savage's daughter,
then she would know

17:23.867 --> 17:25.468
the details of his defenses.

17:25.470 --> 17:26.868
Yes, well, how exactly
are we going to get

17:26.871 --> 17:28.971
those details out of her?

17:28.973 --> 17:30.138
I'm on it.

17:35.545 --> 17:38.680
Hello, Cassie.
May I call you Cassie?

17:38.682 --> 17:41.116
Here's the deal.
You have information.

17:41.118 --> 17:42.384
I want it.

17:42.386 --> 17:44.252
The question is,

17:44.254 --> 17:46.254
how am I gonna get it?

17:49.058 --> 17:51.693
I'm the daughter
of Vandal Savage,

17:51.695 --> 17:54.529
the immortal ruler
of the world.

17:54.531 --> 17:57.866
Do you think he hasn't
prepared me for this?

17:57.868 --> 17:59.534
Do you think I haven't
already been taught

17:59.536 --> 18:01.802
to endure the
most extreme suffering?

18:01.804 --> 18:05.606
You know, your father
sounds a lot like mine.

18:05.608 --> 18:08.409
Could never really say,
"I love you,"

18:08.411 --> 18:10.577
except with his fists.

18:10.579 --> 18:13.547
Our fathers
are nothing alike,

18:13.549 --> 18:15.816
Mr. Snart.

18:17.119 --> 18:21.722
14 years ago, the world
was ruled by a madman,

18:21.724 --> 18:23.457
Per Degaton.

18:23.459 --> 18:25.659
He unleashed
the Armageddon Virus

18:25.661 --> 18:27.728
in order to conquer the globe.

18:27.730 --> 18:30.997
It tore through the world
like a fire.

18:30.999 --> 18:34.667
Millions died,
including my mother.

18:34.669 --> 18:39.639
There wee riots, wars.
Hell on Earth.

18:39.641 --> 18:42.742
No one dared to stand up
to Degaton,

18:42.744 --> 18:46.246
except for my father.

18:46.248 --> 18:48.415
He may not be a kind man,

18:48.417 --> 18:49.849
but he is
the only one capable

18:49.851 --> 18:53.453
of putting this world
back together.

18:53.455 --> 18:57.590
So you can torture me
if you like.

18:57.592 --> 19:00.993
My suffering's
a small price to pay.

19:01.930 --> 19:04.831
Who said anything
about torture?

19:11.973 --> 19:14.340
You sure you can do this?

19:14.342 --> 19:17.709
Bash Savage's skull
with Carter's mace?

19:17.711 --> 19:19.211
You got a better plan?

19:19.213 --> 19:21.180
It's not the weapon
I'm worried about.

19:21.182 --> 19:23.815
Thousands of years
of reincarnation,

19:23.817 --> 19:26.985
and I'm guessing you've killed
a grand total of nobody.

19:26.987 --> 19:30.822
Yet here you are, entering
into the Olympics of murder.

19:30.824 --> 19:31.990
What's your point?

19:31.992 --> 19:34.726
You sure you can
look Savage in the eye

19:34.728 --> 19:38.429
and kill him?

19:38.431 --> 19:42.100
- I'm sure.
- Well, you better be.

19:42.102 --> 19:44.235
Otherwise, you're gonna end up
like the last guy

19:44.237 --> 19:46.670
who swung that thing.

19:57.349 --> 20:00.183
Savage's superweapon
isn't an explosive.

20:00.185 --> 20:02.319
The exact conclusion
I've just come to

20:02.321 --> 20:04.722
after examining soil samples
from the attack site.

20:04.724 --> 20:06.056
How did you determine it?

20:06.058 --> 20:09.126
Gideon... she found
a defunct spy satellite.

20:09.128 --> 20:12.029
Look at the photos here.
This is the camp.

20:12.031 --> 20:13.430
And here is the camp,
destroyed.

20:15.100 --> 20:17.800
Look at the impact craters.
Sort of squint your eyes.

20:17.802 --> 20:19.236
What do they look like?

20:19.238 --> 20:23.073
What am I supposed
to be seeing?

20:23.075 --> 20:25.208
Oh, my God.

20:25.210 --> 20:27.511
Those are not
impact craters.

20:30.582 --> 20:31.714
They're footprints.

20:44.629 --> 20:46.728
Sir, we've located
the rebels responsible

20:46.730 --> 20:48.230
for your daughter's abduction.

20:48.232 --> 20:51.100
The Leviathan is two clicks
from their encampment.

20:51.102 --> 20:53.735
Find my daughter.

20:53.737 --> 20:56.572
And burn them all.

20:58.776 --> 21:00.976
He's coming for me.

21:00.978 --> 21:04.613
Yeah, you and a bunch
of innocent refugees.

21:04.615 --> 21:06.181
If they were innocent,

21:06.183 --> 21:09.150
they wouldn't have rebelled
against my father.

21:11.354 --> 21:13.154
Whatever it is,
it's getting closer.

21:13.156 --> 21:15.523
Well, we're a little short
on weapons.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.793
Look, if we can't outrun it,
we'll just have to fight it.

21:17.795 --> 21:19.094
Well, I mean, we can...

21:22.966 --> 21:24.799
But what about them?

21:31.575 --> 21:33.108
This way.
Move along.

21:33.110 --> 21:35.476
Everything's all right.
Move along.

21:35.478 --> 21:37.812
Everything's fine.

21:37.814 --> 21:39.914
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

21:39.916 --> 21:41.582
Saving a township,
by the looks of it.

21:41.584 --> 21:43.484
Since when did my vessel
become a life raft?

21:43.486 --> 21:44.785
Since I decided we can't

21:44.787 --> 21:46.320
leave these people here
to be slaughtered.

21:46.322 --> 21:47.989
You recruited us
to save the world.

21:47.991 --> 21:50.157
That includes everyone here.

21:50.159 --> 21:52.192
Gideon, power the engines
and get us into the air

21:52.194 --> 21:54.128
the moment the last refugee
is aboard.

21:55.297 --> 21:57.831
And get the weapons system
online.

21:57.833 --> 21:59.433
What's happening?

21:59.435 --> 22:01.301
It would seem Savage has
come back for his baby girl.

22:01.303 --> 22:03.103
<i>The last of the refugees
are aboard, Captain.</i>

22:03.105 --> 22:04.438
Strap yourself in.

22:04.440 --> 22:07.007
Gideon, external floodlights
to maximum.

22:18.786 --> 22:20.686
- That's...
- Incredible.

22:29.563 --> 22:31.296
Ugh! Fire! Now!

22:34.635 --> 22:36.935
Hold on to something!

22:47.881 --> 22:50.982
Fire, Gideon! Fire everything!

22:54.288 --> 22:56.488
Now might be a good time
to start praying.

23:19.929 --> 23:23.297
- Gideon, what's our status?
- I'm gonna go with "lousy."

23:23.299 --> 23:25.533
Shut down all essential
systems so Savage's robot...

23:25.535 --> 23:27.602
<i>Too late, Captain;
apparently, it has determined</i>

23:27.604 --> 23:29.170
<i>you are still alive,
because it is closing in</i>

23:29.172 --> 23:30.271
<i>on our location.</i>

23:30.273 --> 23:32.006
What happened?

23:32.008 --> 23:33.407
We seem to have encountered
Savage's megaweapon.

23:33.409 --> 23:34.575
And he kicked our ass.

23:34.577 --> 23:35.843
Gideon, how much time
do we have?

23:35.845 --> 23:37.311
<i>I estimate the robot</i>

23:37.313 --> 23:39.247
<i>should reach our location
within the hour.</i>

23:39.249 --> 23:41.349
<i>Our propulsion engine was
severely damaged in the crash</i>

23:41.351 --> 23:42.549
<i>and is no longer functioning.</i>

23:42.551 --> 23:44.085
So where does that leave us?

23:44.087 --> 23:46.254
All right, our only option
is to take the Jumpship

23:46.256 --> 23:47.388
and try and outrun it.

23:47.390 --> 23:48.822
The Jumpship seats seven.

23:48.824 --> 23:50.391
The cargo bay's filled
with refugees.

23:50.393 --> 23:51.859
I'm well aware.

23:51.861 --> 23:53.761
Well, we can't
just leave them there; we...

23:57.266 --> 23:59.366
Martin!

23:59.368 --> 24:02.836
Professor, you are gonna be
just fine.

24:02.838 --> 24:03.837
I promise you.

24:03.839 --> 24:06.106
Grey, what happened?

24:06.108 --> 24:07.807
You have to take care
of them.

24:07.809 --> 24:08.975
Don't worry.
We got the team's back.

24:08.977 --> 24:11.577
No. The people.
Those children.

24:11.579 --> 24:13.613
You can't leave them here.

24:13.615 --> 24:15.681
You can't... you can't...

24:17.319 --> 24:19.019
<i>I've administered
a mild sedative.</i>

24:19.021 --> 24:20.586
<i>He should be comfortable.</i>

24:20.588 --> 24:22.922
Which is more than can be said
for the rest of us.

24:26.928 --> 24:29.796
I was wrong.
Your dad's a gem.

24:29.798 --> 24:32.264
He's just doing what he must
to save his daughter.

24:32.266 --> 24:34.066
Whatever you say.
Now, where was I?

24:34.068 --> 24:36.636
Oh, right.
Convincing you to help us.

24:36.638 --> 24:39.871
What a charming euphemism
for interrogation.

24:39.873 --> 24:42.341
I know what you're thinking:
"My dad may not be perfect,

24:42.343 --> 24:45.911
but deep down,
he's not a bad guy."

24:48.983 --> 24:50.349
What are you doing?

24:50.351 --> 24:54.486
Showing you that when it comes
to crap fathers,

24:54.488 --> 24:56.955
there is no "deep down."

24:56.957 --> 24:58.824
After yo

25:11.037 --> 25:12.670
These are the ones
we could save.

25:12.672 --> 25:14.538
The rest are ash,

25:14.540 --> 25:16.374
much like Delta Camp.

25:16.376 --> 25:18.242
You don't know
my father at all

25:18.244 --> 25:20.945
if you think his daughter
could be so easily manipulated.

25:20.947 --> 25:22.480
Just trying to show you
the truth.

25:22.482 --> 25:25.016
The truth is, my father
was trying to save me.

25:25.018 --> 25:28.719
From what, untrained civilians
with barely any weapons?

25:28.721 --> 25:30.721
Your father sent
a 200-foot robot

25:30.723 --> 25:32.356
to level a bunch of tents.

25:32.358 --> 25:35.726
The people in that camp
were rebels, dangerous radicals.

25:35.728 --> 25:36.994
Please.

25:36.996 --> 25:38.762
Do these people look
like radicals to you?

25:38.764 --> 25:42.766
They're nobodies...
everyday folk hoping to survive

25:42.768 --> 25:45.168
your father's reign of terror.

25:45.170 --> 25:49.706
Look, took me a long time to
accept my old man was a monster.

25:49.708 --> 25:52.642
I'm betting you're smarter
than I am.

25:52.644 --> 25:53.910
At last,

25:53.912 --> 25:55.678
something we agree on.

25:57.716 --> 26:01.518
Oh, Per Degaton didn't release
the Armageddon Virus.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.853
That was your father.

26:03.855 --> 26:05.522
Impossible.

26:05.524 --> 26:07.557
He was only
Per Degaton's tutor.

26:07.559 --> 26:10.159
One, Per Degaton was
only a teenager at the time.

26:10.161 --> 26:13.262
Two, he was hardly
a criminal mastermind.

26:13.264 --> 26:15.331
Your father, however...

26:15.333 --> 26:17.734
What makes you think I'd
believe anything you tell me?

26:17.736 --> 26:19.768
Because seeing is believing.

26:19.770 --> 26:23.172
Gideon, show her the footage.

26:23.174 --> 26:27.276
Kasnia, November 3, 2147.

26:27.278 --> 26:30.312
<i>The world's population
is unsustainable</i>

26:30.314 --> 26:32.648
<i>at current levels.</i>

26:32.650 --> 26:34.883
<i>The herd must be thinned.</i>

26:34.885 --> 26:36.317
This isn't true.

26:39.156 --> 26:40.388
You're a liar.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.891
Correct.
But not about this.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.893
And you know it...

26:44.895 --> 26:47.095
deep down.

27:00.710 --> 27:03.445
How are repairs coming?

27:03.447 --> 27:05.246
Are repairs coming?

27:05.248 --> 27:06.647
Not in 30 minutes,

27:06.649 --> 27:08.816
which is about
as much time as we have.

27:08.818 --> 27:10.484
We brought all those people
on board,

27:10.486 --> 27:12.352
and all we've bought them
is an extra few minutes

27:12.354 --> 27:14.354
to live in fear.

27:14.356 --> 27:15.890
Well, I guess the question is,

27:15.892 --> 27:17.024
what do we do
with those minutes?

27:17.026 --> 27:19.460
The ship is crippled!

27:19.462 --> 27:22.429
Everyone aboard
is as dead as my...

27:22.431 --> 27:24.598
Family?

27:24.600 --> 27:29.136
Look, I know that you think
the universe wants them dead,

27:29.138 --> 27:31.771
but I don't;
I don't believe in fate.

27:31.773 --> 27:34.608
I believe in choices.

27:34.610 --> 27:38.278
And we can choose...
we can choose to fight,

27:38.280 --> 27:41.247
even if the fight
may be futile.

27:41.249 --> 27:43.083
We can save your family, Rip.

27:43.085 --> 27:46.019
It's not impossible.
All we have to do...

27:46.021 --> 27:47.420
Is kill Vandal Savage...

27:47.422 --> 27:50.957
the chances of which
appear to be fading.

27:50.959 --> 27:52.325
Not anymore.

27:52.327 --> 27:53.827
I figured out how to do it.

27:53.829 --> 27:58.164
And my new bestie and I
can get us in.

27:58.166 --> 28:00.133
And I think I've got a way
to stop the giant robot

28:00.135 --> 28:01.667
that's coming to kill us.

28:07.275 --> 28:09.642
Now, you may not believe
in fate, Raymond,

28:09.644 --> 28:12.645
but I certainly do.

28:12.647 --> 28:15.180
And perhaps it was fate
that compelled me

28:15.182 --> 28:16.782
to bring you seven together

28:16.784 --> 28:19.118
so we can change this future

28:19.120 --> 28:21.787
once and for all.

28:26.627 --> 28:29.261
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:29.263 --> 28:31.463
So I'm going to take on
an immortal madman,

28:31.465 --> 28:33.998
and you are fighting
a giant robot.

28:35.435 --> 28:37.902
I can't believe
this is our life.

28:37.904 --> 28:41.239
Well, take him out,
and it won't be.

28:43.177 --> 28:44.609
You can do this.

28:46.513 --> 28:50.148
- Ray, if anything...
- No, no.

28:50.150 --> 28:52.383
Save it for after
you destroy Savage.

29:10.169 --> 29:11.568
Sounds like
it's getting closer.

29:11.570 --> 29:12.836
How's it going back there?

29:12.838 --> 29:15.172
You tell me.
This is your nutso idea.

29:15.174 --> 29:16.707
It's not that nutso
when you consider

29:16.709 --> 29:18.709
the theoretical possibility
that siphoning power

29:18.711 --> 29:21.344
from the auxiliary time drive
should provide enough power

29:21.346 --> 29:23.446
to reverse the polarity
of the dwarf star matrix.

29:23.448 --> 29:27.617
Sorry, Ray, I'm falling asleep
back here, man.

29:27.619 --> 29:29.785
Okay. I think we're done.

29:29.787 --> 29:31.153
All right.

29:31.155 --> 29:32.622
You know,
if this doesn't work...

29:32.624 --> 29:34.757
I'll turn every cell
in my body inside out?

29:34.759 --> 29:38.127
I was gonna go with "die,"
but yeah.

29:38.129 --> 29:40.263
You know, we could've escaped
on the Jumpship,

29:40.265 --> 29:41.964
but we're doing this
to save everybody

29:41.966 --> 29:44.166
that we brought
on the Waverider.

29:44.168 --> 29:46.301
You're the real hero here, Ray.

29:46.303 --> 29:47.636
All right.

29:47.638 --> 29:49.205
Stand back.

29:52.710 --> 29:54.844
No. Like, way back.

29:59.850 --> 30:01.750
All right.

30:01.752 --> 30:03.151
Here we go.

30:16.066 --> 30:18.299
It worked. I'm not dead.

30:23.406 --> 30:24.639
Yet.

30:24.641 --> 30:26.641
Okay, let's do this.

30:55.252 --> 30:56.351
Okay. Come on.

30:56.353 --> 30:58.086
Ray, you got this.

31:08.531 --> 31:10.832
The Leviathan
is encountering resistance.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.633
Impossible.

31:15.572 --> 31:17.572
Dr. Palmer.

31:17.574 --> 31:18.706
Clever.

31:18.708 --> 31:20.107
Sir?

31:20.109 --> 31:21.476
What?

31:29.151 --> 31:31.552
I've been so worried.

31:33.723 --> 31:34.956
How did you...

31:34.958 --> 31:37.958
I am your daughter.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.527
Did you really think some
rabble could hold me captive?

31:40.529 --> 31:42.296
Rabble?

31:42.298 --> 31:45.499
These are the time travelers
I warned you of.

31:48.137 --> 31:49.336
Father?

31:52.508 --> 31:55.341
Your bracelet.

31:55.343 --> 31:57.343
It's gone.

31:57.345 --> 32:01.280
I-I must have lost it
in my escape.

32:01.282 --> 32:03.249
Ah.

32:03.251 --> 32:06.653
As the person who tutored you
in the art of deceit,

32:06.655 --> 32:09.455
you cannot fool me,
Cassandra.

32:09.457 --> 32:12.025
Like you fooled me?

32:12.027 --> 32:14.593
You told me my mother died
from the Armageddon Virus.

32:14.595 --> 32:16.662
But you were the one
who released it.

32:16.664 --> 32:18.864
Tell me it isn't true.

32:18.866 --> 32:21.734
I might even pretend
to believe you.

32:38.953 --> 32:41.820
Let me go.

32:41.822 --> 32:44.189
Call them.

32:44.191 --> 32:46.824
Call the ones
that you no doubt helped

32:46.826 --> 32:48.593
gain access to my bunker.

32:48.595 --> 32:51.029
No need to trouble yourself,
Miss Savage.

32:51.031 --> 32:54.132
We're already here.

32:54.134 --> 32:58.303
Oh, I admire your command
of irony, Gareeb...

32:59.372 --> 33:02.774
Using my own child against me.

33:02.776 --> 33:05.242
Sorry to say
it didn't take much.

33:05.244 --> 33:06.978
None at all, you ass.

33:06.980 --> 33:09.213
They showed me the truth
of what you've done.

33:09.215 --> 33:10.448
The innocent...

33:10.450 --> 33:12.650
Do not speak
as if you know anything

33:12.652 --> 33:15.652
about ruling a people.

33:15.654 --> 33:19.523
Do you really want
to align your fate

33:19.525 --> 33:22.726
with these... pretenders?

33:22.728 --> 33:24.695
They're nothing
but grains of sand

33:24.697 --> 33:26.730
in the desert of time.

33:26.732 --> 33:29.567
You are a monster.

33:44.750 --> 33:46.149
<i>Don't just wrestle with him.</i>

33:46.151 --> 33:48.151
Remember,
you got laser blasters.

33:48.153 --> 33:50.086
Actually,
they're compressed light beams.

33:50.088 --> 33:52.222
Well, whatever they're called,
just hit him with them.

33:54.392 --> 33:55.525
Oh, come on!

33:55.527 --> 33:56.726
Yeah!

34:01.099 --> 34:03.566
She's here.

34:03.568 --> 34:06.769
I can sense her.

34:06.771 --> 34:10.940
You do realize
that she can do me no harm?

34:10.942 --> 34:13.242
Clearly,
you didn't get the memo.

34:17.782 --> 34:19.148
Aah!

34:45.574 --> 34:47.908
Aah!

34:47.909 --> 34:49.777
Agh!

35:05.527 --> 35:07.728
Ha! I could
really get used to this.

35:07.730 --> 35:10.263
Stay on him, Ray.
Stay on him.

35:23.011 --> 35:24.444
Agh!

35:35.190 --> 35:36.723
I had it covered.

35:36.725 --> 35:37.890
Sure, you did.

35:47.668 --> 35:49.001
<i>Get up, Ray!</i>

35:49.003 --> 35:50.369
Ray, get up!

35:55.476 --> 35:57.209
This is for Carter.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.497
Unh!

36:34.993 --> 36:37.994
Your love...

36:37.996 --> 36:40.663
Reincarnated.

36:42.233 --> 36:45.101
He doesn't even remember
who he was...

36:45.103 --> 36:47.269
and he never will.

36:47.271 --> 36:48.404
What?

36:48.406 --> 36:51.373
When I first discovered him,

36:51.375 --> 36:55.577
when I found out that he had
no idea about his real identity,

36:55.579 --> 36:57.780
I took my precautions

36:57.782 --> 37:00.716
and I locked his mind away.

37:00.718 --> 37:02.918
You brainwashed him!

37:02.920 --> 37:04.552
Come on!

37:05.755 --> 37:07.588
Strike me down.

37:07.590 --> 37:08.924
Kill me.

37:08.926 --> 37:11.860
But do so knowing
that I am the only one

37:11.862 --> 37:14.595
holding the key to his mind.

37:21.538 --> 37:24.171
<i>Get up, Ray.
Get up.</i>

37:24.173 --> 37:26.674
Rip said you told him
you don't believe in fate...

37:26.676 --> 37:28.275
just choices.

37:28.277 --> 37:30.945
<i>Well, you got
a choice to make right now.</i>

37:30.947 --> 37:33.715
You got to choose
to get up and fight.

37:33.717 --> 37:36.750
<i>You got to choose to live.</i>

37:58.006 --> 37:59.439
Whoo! Come on!

38:06.948 --> 38:08.815
That's what I'm talking about,
baby!

38:14.155 --> 38:15.755
Ha-ha!

38:15.757 --> 38:17.823
Kendra,
what are you waiting for?

38:17.825 --> 38:19.025
Finish him!

38:19.027 --> 38:21.761
Destroy me,
and you doom him.

38:21.763 --> 38:25.564
It's Carter.

38:25.566 --> 38:27.666
The reinforcements
are coming!

38:28.736 --> 38:29.835
Whatever you plan on doing,

38:29.837 --> 38:31.036
Kendra, do it!

38:33.173 --> 38:37.142
If I kill Savage,
his mind will be lost.

38:37.144 --> 38:42.480
And if you don't,
I will lose my wife and son.

38:42.482 --> 38:46.451
Well, my love,
what's it gonna be, huh?

38:46.453 --> 38:49.121
Come on!

38:49.123 --> 38:50.322
Ugh!

38:53.227 --> 38:55.928
I can't.

38:55.930 --> 38:58.630
I'm so sorry, Rip. I can't.

39:02.969 --> 39:05.470
We need to get them
back to the ship.

39:05.472 --> 39:06.471
Both of them.

39:12.145 --> 39:15.879
You! What's to keep me from
killing you where you stand?

39:15.881 --> 39:19.150
Because she's an asset
to the cause.

39:19.152 --> 39:21.552
My father may be
incapacitated,

39:21.554 --> 39:23.921
but his forces
are still strong.

39:23.923 --> 39:27.491
I know their tactics,
their weaknesses.

39:28.995 --> 39:31.862
Why the change of heart?

39:31.864 --> 39:33.363
Ask him.

39:41.907 --> 39:45.041
Hey. I saw Sara.

39:45.043 --> 39:46.577
She said you brought Savage
back onto the ship,

39:46.579 --> 39:48.611
but she was a little stingy
on the details.

39:50.582 --> 39:51.781
Is everything okay?

39:56.088 --> 39:59.022
Ray,

39:59.024 --> 40:00.723
we need to talk.

40:11.736 --> 40:12.935
Welcome back.

40:12.937 --> 40:14.604
Ah.

40:14.606 --> 40:17.072
Well, the team managed
to capture Savage,

40:17.074 --> 40:20.342
battle his army
and a giant robot...

40:20.344 --> 40:23.212
and you managed to sleep
through all of it.

40:23.214 --> 40:25.447
Hmm.

40:25.449 --> 40:26.615
The refugees...

40:26.617 --> 40:28.583
They're safe.

40:28.585 --> 40:30.852
Every one of them
is alive and well.

40:30.854 --> 40:33.322
But for how long?

40:33.324 --> 40:36.791
Apparently,
time wants to happen.

40:36.793 --> 40:39.794
Oh, I think you'll find
that time...

40:39.796 --> 40:41.763
for once...

40:41.765 --> 40:44.065
is on our side.

40:45.969 --> 40:47.702
Now,

40:47.704 --> 40:49.738
if you'll excuse me,

40:49.740 --> 40:52.641
I have to pay a visit
to an old friend.

40:57.380 --> 41:00.281
Well, you seem quite happy
for a man behind bars.

41:00.283 --> 41:02.283
Why shouldn't I be happy?

41:02.285 --> 41:05.420
It seems that you once again
have failed to kill me.

41:05.422 --> 41:07.855
A momentary setback,
I assure you.

41:07.857 --> 41:10.024
Assure yourself.

41:10.026 --> 41:11.559
Providence has allowed me

41:11.561 --> 41:17.064
to place Chay-Ara
in an impossible situation:

41:17.066 --> 41:21.301
a choice between
her own soul mate, Carter...

41:21.303 --> 41:22.402
and yours.

41:24.306 --> 41:26.406
You know, a friend recently
suggested to me

41:26.408 --> 41:31.144
that there is no such thing
as fate.

41:31.146 --> 41:35.549
Destiny is nothing more
than the sum of our own choices.

41:35.551 --> 41:38.017
I see.

41:38.019 --> 41:40.787
So you still think
there's hope, then...

41:40.789 --> 41:42.489
for your family.

41:44.993 --> 41:47.493
Time will tell, Captain.

41:50.699 --> 41:52.231
Time will tell.
