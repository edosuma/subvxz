AMY: Previously on "Heartland."

00:04.421 --> 00:07.340
 Well, I know how much
you love this place.

00:07.465 --> 00:08.550
 I do.

00:08.675 --> 00:11.219
That view is incredible.

00:11.344 --> 00:15.098
 Well, it's yours.

00:15.223 --> 00:16.265
 What's he doing?

00:16.391 --> 00:17.434
 Oh.

00:17.559 --> 00:18.351
He likes to record
a lot of the runs

00:18.476 --> 00:19.477
so he can study them later.

00:25.859 --> 00:26.901
 It's a strain.

00:27.027 --> 00:27.902
 How bad is it?

00:28.028 --> 00:28.987
 It's hard to say.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.405
There's a lot of inflammation.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.741
 Thanks for helping out,
but it's getting late.

00:32.866 --> 00:33.658
You don't have to stay.

00:33.783 --> 00:38.455
[music playing]

00:38.580 --> 00:40.165
 Yeah, I was just calling
to make sure that you

00:40.290 --> 00:41.416
hadn't got on the gossip site.

00:41.541 --> 00:42.375
 No, I haven't.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.126
 Good.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.878
So don't.

WOMAN (VOICEOVER): --yokel
is totally out of her league.

00:47.672 --> 00:49.049
Georgie's the worst.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.759
She'd even hurt
her horse to win.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.360
TY: What a beautiful
piece of land.

01:08.485 --> 01:12.739
AMY: I still can't believe
it's actually ours.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.200
TY: You know, I can
already picture it.

01:15.325 --> 01:18.328
Big yard for Lyndy to play in.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.246
Nice front porch where we
can sit out in the morning

01:20.372 --> 01:22.374
and drink our coffee.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.376
 It really sounds amazing.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.794
 Well, we'll have
to do our research,

01:25.919 --> 01:31.466
obviously, figure a few
things out, but come on.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.968
We've go to do something
with this property.

01:34.094 --> 01:34.928
Just look at it.

01:35.053 --> 01:39.724
[music playing]

01:43.061 --> 01:44.312
 It had to be Dylan.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.980
 No way.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.649
 You said he records all of
his competitors on his phone,

01:47.774 --> 01:49.484
right?

01:49.609 --> 01:50.735
 Yeah, but there's no way he
would do something like this.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.445
 Why?

01:52.570 --> 01:54.572
He's no different from all
those other stuck-up rich kids.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.534
If you're not part of their
club, you're their enemy.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.328
 Well, if that's the case,
then he really fooled me.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.081
 Yeah, well, he didn't fool me.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.124
I had his number
from the beginning.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.709
That guy's bad news.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.502
 OK, I need to get
back to the barn.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.003
I have to get
ready for my shift.

[music playing]

02:18.138 --> 02:19.639
 Hey.

02:19.764 --> 02:20.890
 I got to go into Maggie's
to do some paperwork.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.392
Do you want to head in together?
- Yeah, sure.

02:22.517 --> 02:23.393
I'll meet you downstairs.

02:23.518 --> 02:24.352

Georgie is the worst

02:53.173 --> 02:55.216
That horse has no business
being in the jumping ring.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.594
No wonder this happened.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.220
Somebody should get
on Georgie's back

02:59.346 --> 03:00.722
and jump her into the ground.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.351
 Guys!
Guys!

03:04.476 --> 03:05.310
I have got news!

03:05.435 --> 03:06.853
I've got amazing news.

03:06.978 --> 03:07.729
This is huge.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.356
OK, so I'm at Maggie's.

03:09.481 --> 03:10.398
I'm having breakfast.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.900
 Amazing news, Mitch.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.360
 Just let the man talk.

03:13.485 --> 03:14.361
 I'm sitting beside this guy.

03:14.486 --> 03:15.779
He's having steak and eggs.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.405
And he's going on about
how great the steak is.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.033
So I casually tell him that
all the beef on the menu

03:20.158 --> 03:21.618
comes from Heartland Ranch.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.037
So then he introduces
himself to me,

03:24.162 --> 03:29.709
and this guy is none
other than Fred Garland.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.086
 Fred Garland?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.504
Is that Garland Foods?

03:32.629 --> 03:33.797
 Yeah.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.423
 You had breakfast with
the owner of the biggest

03:35.548 --> 03:36.549
grocery store chain in Calgary?

03:36.675 --> 03:37.300
 Yes.

03:37.425 --> 03:39.052
Yes, I did.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.137
This guy is all about selling
local farm-fresh products.

03:41.262 --> 03:44.683
And he wants to do a partnership
with Heartland Ranch.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.894
He wants to meet tomorrow
to talk about a deal.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.312
 I like it.

03:49.437 --> 03:52.941
Selling directly to a
big player like Garland?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.401
Yeah.

03:54.526 --> 03:55.402
OK, I'll clear my schedule.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.862
I'll be at the meeting.

03:57.987 --> 03:58.780
 Thanks, Tim, but I've--

03:58.905 --> 03:59.739
I've got this one.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.032
 No.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.659
 I made first contact.

04:02.784 --> 04:03.993
I should be the
face of this deal.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.329
 No, you're not going
to go to that meeting

04:06.454 --> 04:07.622
without one of us
going with you.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.832
 Why?

04:08.957 --> 04:10.583
 All right, let's
not be too hasty.

04:10.709 --> 04:13.253
Mitch is the one
who met the man.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.671
They already have
a relationship.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.964
A good start by
the sounds of it.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.800
I say we let Mitch handle it.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.385
TIM: Seriously?

04:20.510 --> 04:23.596
 Equal partner, remember?

04:23.722 --> 04:26.891
Besides, don't you have enough
on your plate these days?

04:27.017 --> 04:28.601
 I feel great.

04:28.727 --> 04:32.981
 I'm just saying, you might
have a little more focus on.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.698
 Thank you.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.199

05:03.136 --> 05:04.804
No wonder this happened.

05:04.929 --> 05:05.930
That's what happens when you
turn a cow pony into a jumper.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.349
Somebody should get
on Georgie's back

05:07.474 --> 05:08.725

05:31.831 --> 05:33.041
Not even a horse
like Phoenix deserves

05:33.166 --> 05:35.669
to be treated like that.

05:35.794 --> 05:39.130
Somebody should save
that poor horse.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.220
 I am so sorry.

I can't believe I just did that.

05:46.262 --> 05:47.055
 It's OK.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.223
It's OK.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.641
It happens to the best of us.

 You know the accident
wasn't your fault, right?

Those comments are just lies.

did something wrong.

It's so humiliating.

just jealous people

them get to you.

it never even happened.

that simple, OK?

the fall finale rolls around,

everyone will have
forgotten all about this.

we build a house on the

08:53.283 --> 08:55.076
 Yeah, does he
know how you feel?

spoke, you didn't seem

08:57.037 --> 08:59.205
to want to go down that road.

 Well, he was--

09:00.373 --> 09:01.624
he was really excited.

rain on his parade.

knew where to live.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.904
 Yeah, I think so.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.572
 Well, you got to remember
that a guy like Garland

09:32.697 --> 09:36.618
doesn't have a big grocery
empire because he caves easily.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.078
A guy like that can be ruthless.

09:38.203 --> 09:41.664
He can smell weakness
from a mile away.

video down, or you

10:08.108 --> 10:09.693
 OK, what is it?

10:09.818 --> 10:11.945
 Well, I'm meeting with
the CEO of Garland Foods

10:12.070 --> 10:14.656
tomorrow to figure out a
price for Heartland's beef.

10:14.781 --> 10:15.949
 Wow, impressive.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.951
 Yeah, well, I figured
because you have

10:18.076 --> 10:19.494
some experience
with negotiations,

10:19.619 --> 10:22.497
you might have
some advice for me.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.498
 Yes, I would--

10:23.623 --> 10:24.374
I'd love to help you out.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.834
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.168
 Great.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.753
 OK, well, there's a
lot of ground to cover.

10:28.878 --> 10:29.838
You might want to sit down.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.134
So basically, there
are five rules

10:34.259 --> 10:36.970
to follow if you want to
successfully negotiate a deal.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.180
Rule number one, personalize.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.849
You want to start with
a little small talk

10:40.974 --> 10:43.268
before you ease into
the business at hand.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.146
You should probably
be writing this down.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.480
Here you go.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.191
Rule number two, know
your walk-away price.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.610
You want to set your price,
and never go below it.

10:52.736 --> 10:55.030
Rule number three,
make the first ask.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.489
Don't wait for them
to lowball you.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.366
You'll have to figure out
the price on your own,

10:58.491 --> 11:00.326
but I suggest you start high.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.580
Buyers equate higher
prices with higher quality.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.291
Rule number four,
power position.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.376
They need you more
than you need them.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.794
They want your product.

11:09.919 --> 11:10.712
You don't have to sell it.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.298
It sells itself.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.591
TY: Well, why didn't
you say anything?

11:14.716 --> 11:15.633
 I'm sorry.

11:15.759 --> 11:18.053
I-- I know I should have.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.512
And we're definitely
outgrowing this space.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.264
I get that.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.391
But part of me thinks we
should consider other options.

11:26.770 --> 11:27.979
 OK.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.106
Like what?

11:30.231 --> 11:34.778
 I don't know, maybe we could
move into the ranch house.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.696
 The ranch house?

11:36.821 --> 11:39.532
 I know it's not
ideal, but it would

11:39.657 --> 11:45.038
give us some time to save money
and think about our next move.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.165
Grandpa grew up in that
house, and so did my mom,

11:47.290 --> 11:50.251
and so did Lou and I. And
I guess maybe part of me

11:50.377 --> 11:52.087
wanted Lyndy to
grow up there, too.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.092
 I-- I get what
you're saying, Amy.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.010
I do.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.136
You've got a lot of
family traditions

12:00.261 --> 12:01.304
that have happened
in that house.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.681
And-- and you want
them to continue.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.516
That makes sense.

12:04.641 --> 12:10.063
I-- I just think that--

12:10.188 --> 12:11.648
I think that we need to
start our own traditions,

12:11.773 --> 12:16.111
you know, build our own
house, and start fresh for us.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.696
Don't you think?

12:17.821 --> 12:19.114
 Yeah.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.115
 Yeah.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.411
 We don't need to decide
on this right now, right?

12:29.874 --> 12:32.836
 Of course not.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.296
I'm going to get
Lyndy's bath running.

12:35.422 --> 12:40.260
[music playing]

12:52.022 --> 12:53.898
 What are you doing here?

12:54.024 --> 12:55.442
 What do you mean?

12:55.567 --> 12:56.401
 I own half the place.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.777
I come and go.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.446
 Garland is going to
be here any minute.

12:59.571 --> 13:00.989
 Wow, relax.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.490
I'm just here to have a coffee.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.833
 Hey, Phoenix.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.585
How you doing?

13:13.710 --> 13:14.502
Huh, bud?

13:19.257 --> 13:20.133
 Hey.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.891
I texted.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.017
I left you messages.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.356
Why are you ghosting me?

13:37.108 --> 13:40.487
 Was it you who
posted the video?

13:45.742 --> 13:48.536
 All right, I took the video.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.954
 Why would you?

13:50.080 --> 13:52.165
 But I didn't post it
on that gossip site.

13:52.290 --> 13:56.336
I know how bad this
sounds, but it's the truth.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.337
I swear.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.549
 Hey.

14:01.675 --> 14:02.634
You OK?

14:02.759 --> 14:04.886
 Yeah.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.262
 What are you doing here?

14:06.388 --> 14:08.473
 I just wanted to see
how Georgie was doing.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.849
 Oh, yeah?

14:09.974 --> 14:11.267
Not so good, thanks to you.

14:11.393 --> 14:14.312
 Yeah, I took the video,
but I didn't post it.

14:14.437 --> 14:15.855
And I would never do
anything like that.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.065
 That's such a
load of crap, dude.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.358
That's--
- No, Wyatt.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.734
 You don't actually
believe him, do you?

14:19.859 --> 14:23.113
 I can prove it.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.198
All the videos on
the gossip site

14:25.323 --> 14:28.868
have a timestamp indicating
when it was posted.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.830
The timestamp is
2:30 in the morning.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.623
 So what?

14:33.748 --> 14:35.208
 So I couldn't have posted it
because at 2:30 in the morning,

14:35.333 --> 14:36.584
I was right here with Georgie.

14:36.710 --> 14:41.673
[music playing]

14:41.798 --> 14:43.425
 What were you doing
with my girlfriend at 2:30

14:43.550 --> 14:44.884
in the morning?

14:45.010 --> 14:47.345
 He was helping me with
Phoenix after the accident.

14:47.470 --> 14:48.263
 All night?

14:55.979 --> 14:57.188
Since you guys are
obviously so close,

14:57.313 --> 15:00.525
I want to leave you alone.

15:00.650 --> 15:01.568
 No, Wyatt, wait.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.445
 You know, it's
funny that I walked

15:03.570 --> 15:06.072
in here thinking that he was
the third wheel, but it's me.

15:06.197 --> 15:11.578
[music playing]

15:16.332 --> 15:17.792
 Thanks for coming, Jack.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.880
 Well, there's nothing more
I'd like to see than you

15:22.005 --> 15:24.132
and Amy building on this land.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.385
So if you think this
little project of yours

15:27.510 --> 15:29.679
is going to tip the
scale in that direction,

15:29.804 --> 15:31.598
I'm more than happy to help.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.725
 Well, I just hope it works.

15:33.850 --> 15:34.934
 It's worth a shot.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.395
Look at that nice
swing you made.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.480
 Oh, you like it?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.440
 I do.

15:40.565 --> 15:42.609
 Yeah.

15:42.734 --> 15:43.610
 No.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.825
 He's over an hour late.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.951
I'm not surprised.

15:52.077 --> 15:53.203
Common tactic.

15:53.328 --> 15:56.831
Puts Garland in a
position of power.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.708
 You know, I find it
just a little interesting

15:58.833 --> 16:01.336
that you're still here
after saying you just

16:01.461 --> 16:04.756
stopped in for a cup of coffee.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.966
 I'm not in a rush.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.176
 Of course.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.974
 Hey, sorry I'm late.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.476
I ran into some traffic--
- No worries.

16:16.601 --> 16:17.811
- --as I was leaving the city.
- It's all right.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.938
It's good to see you, Fred.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.982
Why don't you take a seat?

16:23.108 --> 16:25.819
So I think I read somewhere
that you're a fly fisherman.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.405
 Now and then, but I can't
say I'm very good at it.

16:28.530 --> 16:29.781
 You ever drop a
line in the Highwood?

16:29.906 --> 16:30.782
It's a great spot.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.450
You know, once, I caught--

16:32.575 --> 16:33.827
 Tim Fleming.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.704
I'm one of the partners
in this cattle operation.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.667
I don't think Fred came here
to talk about fly fishing.

16:40.792 --> 16:42.210
I think he came here
to talk about business.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.378
So let's do business.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.383
 I like your no
bull attitude, Tim.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.386
But before we start
talking numbers,

16:51.511 --> 16:54.889
I'd like to tell you both
a bit about Garland Foods.

16:55.015 --> 16:58.018
When my dad started this
company 30 years ago,

16:58.143 --> 17:01.479
we were a small,
family-run grocery store.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.231
Now, I can't say we're
very small anymore,

17:03.356 --> 17:06.568
but I like to think we're
still like a family.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.569
 Great.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.366
 These are all the jars
I could find in the loft.

17:13.491 --> 17:14.409
 Thank you.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.367
 Where's Lyndy?

17:15.492 --> 17:16.869
 Oh, she's playing with Katie.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.579
 That's good.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.165
Lou, I got to ask.

17:20.290 --> 17:23.585
What's with the
sudden urge to can?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.045
 No matter who I
talk to, I can't get

17:25.170 --> 17:26.921
that stupid video taken down.

17:27.047 --> 17:30.467
So my daughter is in turmoil,
and I am powerless to help her.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.178
But at least we'll have enough
pickled carrots to last us

17:33.303 --> 17:34.137
through the apocalypse.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.388
 Yes, that is true.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.806
Well, let me help at least.

17:36.931 --> 17:38.641
 Thank you.

17:38.767 --> 17:42.312
So Grandpa tells me Ty's
talking about building a house.

17:42.437 --> 17:44.898
 We haven't totally
decided on that yet.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.149
You know, we're
not really seeing

17:46.274 --> 17:47.275
eye-to-eye at the moment.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.693
 Hmm.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.904
Been there, done that,
got the scars to prove it.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.614
 Any advice?

17:52.739 --> 17:54.491
 Amy, I once bought
a house at an auction

17:54.616 --> 17:56.368
without talking to
my husband first.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.827
You don't want my advice.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.746
 Actually, I would love it.

17:59.871 --> 18:04.084
 OK, well, try and
keep an open mind.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.670
I mean, maybe you guys aren't
as far apart as you think.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.546
You both want the
same thing, right?

18:08.672 --> 18:10.799
A safe and happy home for Lyndy.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.055
 Hey, Wyatt.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.599
It's me again.

18:19.724 --> 18:20.642
Please call me back.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.234
 I'm so sorry, Georgie.

18:29.359 --> 18:32.612
I didn't know me being here
the other night was a secret.

18:32.737 --> 18:33.780
 It wasn't.

18:33.905 --> 18:36.908
I just hadn't got
around to telling Wyatt.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.159
 Why not?

18:38.284 --> 18:39.661
It's not like we
did anything wrong.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.333
 Why did it feel so wrong?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.674
You should go.

18:52.799 --> 18:58.013
 OK, but one last thing.

18:58.138 --> 19:01.099
I've been thinking a lot
lately about how that video

19:01.224 --> 19:03.727
ended up on the internet.

19:03.852 --> 19:08.481
My phone is password protected,
but my computer at home isn't.

19:08.606 --> 19:09.816
 So?

19:09.941 --> 19:12.152
 The videos I take on
my phone automatically

19:12.277 --> 19:14.529
sync to my computer.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.157
Peyton saw me taking
that video in the arena.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.492
It wouldn't have been hard
for her to go into my room

19:19.617 --> 19:21.453
and post that video during
the night I was here.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.043
 I don't understand.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.377
Why would she do that?

19:29.502 --> 19:32.505
 I wouldn't put
anything past Peyton.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.840
I just wish I had the proof.

19:36.634 --> 19:40.055
 You know, at Garland
Foods, we live by the three

19:40.180 --> 19:43.933
Fs, friendly, fresh, and family.

19:44.059 --> 19:46.436
 Well, I can say that
we, at Heartland Ranch,

19:46.561 --> 19:50.440
look forward to becoming
part of Garland's family.

19:50.565 --> 19:55.320
This is our price per pound.

19:55.445 --> 19:58.198
 Can I talk to
you for a second?

19:58.323 --> 19:59.908
Would you excuse
us just one moment?

20:02.660 --> 20:06.748
 Just-- just a quick second.

20:09.167 --> 20:09.918
 What are you doing?

20:10.043 --> 20:10.877
 What am I doing?

20:11.002 --> 20:12.462
What are you doing?

20:12.587 --> 20:13.797
I knew you were going to
ruin this whole thing for me.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.590
 Oh, no, you're doing
that all on your own.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.468
Everybody knows you let the
other guy make the first offer.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.428
 I set our price
as high to show

20:20.553 --> 20:21.846
that we had a quality product.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.265
 Where did you get
that lamebrain idea?

20:24.391 --> 20:25.517
 Lou told me.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.227
 Lou's not in the
cattle business.

20:27.352 --> 20:28.395
You shut your mouth.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.729
You let me make the deal.
- Why?

20:29.854 --> 20:31.064
So you get all the credit?
- No.

20:31.189 --> 20:32.399
 This is what you want.

20:32.524 --> 20:33.858
You want to be the
big man all the time.

20:33.983 --> 20:34.734
- That's not what I'm doing.
- That's a big man.

20:34.859 --> 20:35.276
 I'm not doing that.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.236
 That's what--

20:36.361 --> 20:37.404
 Excuse me?

20:37.529 --> 20:39.406
I can see I've
come on a bad day.

20:39.531 --> 20:41.032
Why don't we do
this another time?

20:41.157 --> 20:42.117
 No, we're-- no, we're fine.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.451
This is-- no, we're good.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.577
 Well, you and
your son don't seem

20:44.703 --> 20:45.370
like you're on the same page.

20:45.495 --> 20:46.329
 He's not my dad.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.664
 He's not my son.

20:47.789 --> 20:48.790
 Oh.

20:48.915 --> 20:49.916
Well, I'm sorry.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.543
I-- I was under the
impression that this

20:51.668 --> 20:53.378
was a family-run operation.

20:53.503 --> 20:54.629
I mean, that's a big
part of the reason I

20:54.754 --> 20:56.214
wanted to do business with you.

20:56.339 --> 20:58.383
 Well, he's not
my biological son,

20:58.508 --> 21:01.594
but he is like a son to me.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.805
And I'm probably a
father figure to him.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.974
Right, Mitch?

21:06.099 --> 21:07.267
 Yeah, he's a real role model.

21:07.392 --> 21:08.768
 Look, I tend to
make my decisions

21:08.893 --> 21:10.437
based on what my gut tells me.

21:10.562 --> 21:12.147
And right now, my gut is
telling me that this just

21:12.272 --> 21:14.107
isn't going to be a good fit.

21:14.232 --> 21:16.609
I'm sorry I've wasted your time.

21:16.735 --> 21:17.902
 Well, wait, hold on.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.822
We-- we--

21:20.947 --> 21:25.785
[music playing]

21:25.910 --> 21:30.665
 So what would building a
house on this spot mean to you?

21:30.790 --> 21:35.545
 Well, a lot of
things, I guess.

21:35.670 --> 21:38.506
I never had a real home
when I was growing up,

21:38.631 --> 21:40.091
and I want to give Lyndy that.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.968
 You know, it's funny.

21:42.093 --> 21:45.430
If you would have said to me 50
years ago that today I'd still

21:45.555 --> 21:47.265
be living in the
house I grew up in,

21:47.390 --> 21:48.808
I would have said you're crazy.

21:48.933 --> 21:49.976
 Oh, really?

21:50.101 --> 21:51.644
 Well, a much younger
version of myself

21:51.770 --> 21:54.105
figured I might
live in Nashville.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.690
 Nashville?

21:55.815 --> 21:58.193
 Well, Lyndy was chasing
a music career at the time,

21:58.318 --> 22:00.028
so it made sense.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.154
 Well, what happened?

22:01.279 --> 22:02.864
 Oh, you know what they say.

22:02.989 --> 22:07.327
Life is what happens when
you're making other plans.

22:07.452 --> 22:10.038
 You know, building a house
for your daughter to grow up

22:10.163 --> 22:11.331
in, that's a noble thing, Ty.

22:11.456 --> 22:13.166
I hope it works out for you.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.669
I really do.

22:15.794 --> 22:21.007
But as long as you and Amy
and Lyndy are together,

22:21.132 --> 22:24.052
you're home, whether
that's in the loft,

22:24.177 --> 22:27.972
or down at the ranch house, or
right here in a fancy new home.

22:28.098 --> 22:29.766
 Hey, it's not going
to be that fancy.

22:29.891 --> 22:32.727
 I think you're
missing the point here.

22:32.852 --> 22:33.895
 No, I--

22:34.020 --> 22:37.649
I-- I hear what
you're saying, Jack.

22:37.774 --> 22:40.151
I'm a lucky man to
have Amy and Lyndy,

22:40.276 --> 22:42.028
and I have a beautiful life.

22:42.153 --> 22:45.782
And building my own home would
be like icing on the cake.

22:45.907 --> 22:50.245
But cake tastes a whole
lot better with icing.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.413
Don't you think?

22:54.290 --> 22:55.083
Works good.

22:58.294 --> 22:59.713
PEYTON: That's ridiculous.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.089
GEORGIE: Dylan was
sure it was you.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.757
 And you actually believe him?

23:02.882 --> 23:04.050
 I don't know.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.927
 Look, I get that
you're confused and hurt,

23:06.052 --> 23:08.638
but I'm your friend, Georgie,
or at least I thought I was.

23:08.763 --> 23:11.057
 I just don't know
who to trust anymore.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.851
 Maybe you should
stop trying to figure

23:12.976 --> 23:14.853
out who posted the video and
start worrying about why.

23:14.978 --> 23:15.729
 OK.

23:15.854 --> 23:16.771
Why?

23:19.441 --> 23:23.737
 Look, I would never
say this, but some people

23:23.862 --> 23:25.655
think that you're better off
trick riding in some circus

23:25.780 --> 23:27.615
or rounding up cows
rather than wasting

23:27.741 --> 23:29.701
your time in the jumping ring.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.036
They say that you're
way out of your league,

23:31.161 --> 23:34.748
and this video was
just a wake-up call.

23:34.873 --> 23:36.207
Listen, if I were
you, I would just take

23:36.332 --> 23:37.834
a little break from jumping.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.586
I'm worried that if you
enter in the fall finale

23:39.711 --> 23:41.046
now that people in the
stands will start booing,

23:41.171 --> 23:44.549
and it's just not
worth the risk.

23:44.674 --> 23:46.926
Think about it, OK?

23:47.052 --> 23:48.345
I got to go.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.763
I want to go to schooling
session in before dinner.

23:49.888 --> 23:50.472
Bye.

23:50.597 --> 23:55.060
[music playing]

23:57.437 --> 23:59.147
 Hey.

23:59.272 --> 24:02.150
I got your text.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.568
What is going on here?

24:07.489 --> 24:10.658
 Here, take a seat.

24:10.784 --> 24:14.996
When I saw these trees, I knew
they were perfect for a swing.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.499
You can basically see
everything from here.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.668
It's an incredible view.

24:19.793 --> 24:20.794
 Yeah.

24:20.919 --> 24:23.171
 And look, there's
our front door

24:23.296 --> 24:25.298
that Lyndy comes racing out of
every morning with her backpack

24:25.423 --> 24:27.050
on to catch the bus.

24:27.175 --> 24:28.009
She's late.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.010
She takes after her mom.

24:29.135 --> 24:29.969
 Hey.

24:30.095 --> 24:31.471
Very funny.

24:31.596 --> 24:35.266
 And it's the
same beautiful door

24:35.392 --> 24:38.019
that we're going to bring
our Christmas tree through.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.688
It's going to be way
too big for the house.

24:39.813 --> 24:42.357
We're going have to
shove it through the door

24:42.482 --> 24:45.026
and stand it up.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.195
It's going to fill the
entire living room.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.030
It's going to be huge.

24:49.155 --> 24:54.202
And at night, when we
turn the lights on,

24:54.327 --> 24:56.037
it's the most magical thing
that you've ever seen.

24:58.665 --> 24:59.833
 You're right.

24:59.958 --> 25:03.420
This is a pretty
incredible view.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.922
 It's a view of
the future, Amy,

25:06.047 --> 25:09.759
but only if we're
on the same page.

25:09.884 --> 25:12.887
 You've thought about
this a lot, haven't you?

25:13.013 --> 25:15.181
 I have.

25:15.306 --> 25:18.601
I think this could be
the next big step for us.

25:18.727 --> 25:21.688
 Maybe you're right.

25:21.813 --> 25:23.648
Maybe we should build
a home of our own,

25:23.773 --> 25:25.859
start our own traditions.

25:25.984 --> 25:28.278
 Yes.

25:28.403 --> 25:30.488
 I'm still worried
we can't afford it.

25:30.613 --> 25:32.407
 We'll make it work, Amy.

25:32.532 --> 25:34.701
I know we can.

25:34.826 --> 25:35.910
 OK.

25:36.036 --> 25:37.829
I guess we're building a house.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.247
 OK.

25:39.372 --> 25:44.252
[music playing]

25:52.552 --> 25:54.929
 I believe you.

25:55.055 --> 25:56.848
 What?

 I believe you when
you say that nothing

25:58.683 --> 26:01.186
happened with Dylan.

26:01.311 --> 26:05.940
What I need to know is why
didn't you tell me that you

26:06.066 --> 26:08.276
were with him that night.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.278
 I don't know.

26:10.403 --> 26:11.571
I should have said something.

26:11.696 --> 26:14.407
I should have been
honest with you.

26:14.532 --> 26:17.077
I messed up.

26:17.202 --> 26:20.622
 Is it because you like
him as more than a friend?

26:27.379 --> 26:29.756
OK.

26:29.881 --> 26:32.425
I'll take that as a yes.

this easy for you, OK?

I'm going to walk away,
and if you stop me

26:55.031 --> 26:57.575
before I get to my
car, I'll come back,

and maybe we can work this out.

26:59.285 --> 27:04.749
[music playing]

28:05.143 --> 28:07.020
 I knew building a
house would be expensive,

28:07.145 --> 28:09.189
but I didn't think it
would be this much.

28:09.314 --> 28:11.316
TY: Well, a pre-fabricated
home is only one option.

28:11.441 --> 28:13.068
 Yeah, but it's probably
our cheapest option,

28:13.193 --> 28:15.070
and we can't even
afford half of this.

28:15.195 --> 28:15.987
TY: Yes, we can.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.530
 How?

28:17.655 --> 28:24.287

there's got to be a way, OK?

it out, all right?

 I'm going to call
Peyton's mother right now.

28:34.047 --> 28:35.674
 She's just going to
deny posting the video.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.050
There's no point.

28:37.175 --> 28:38.051
 The point is, I'm
not going to let Peyton

28:38.176 --> 28:39.928
hurt my daughter like this.

28:40.053 --> 28:41.179

New York with you?

28:52.190 --> 28:54.442
Not just to visit but to live.

 Are you sure
that's what you want?

 I need a change, and I--

29:03.576 --> 29:05.161
I miss you and Katie.

 Honey, I would love for you
to come to New York with me.

29:12.919 --> 29:18.633
Nothing would make me
happier, but you'd be leaving

29:18.758 --> 29:22.637
so many things unfinished here.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.931

stay here anymore.

 I'm not so sure
about that, either.

Look at this number.

That's way too high.

the number we discussed?

get the best of me.

been misinformed.
