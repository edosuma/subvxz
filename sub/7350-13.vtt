WEBVTT

00:26.660 --> 00:28.496
Really?

00:28.529 --> 00:29.797
Ugh.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.232
What the hell?

00:31.265 --> 00:33.067
You were half a block
behind me on Dumaine.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.069
Which is why I cut
through Armstrong Park.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.470
Looks like I win.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.738
Looks like
you cheated.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.340
All in how you look at it.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.343
We said last one
to the steps buys breakfast.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.745
I'm thinking--
Toast on Laurel Street.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.414
Later.

00:46.447 --> 00:49.417
Training for distance,
stamina-- not speed.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.784
It's about bacon
at the moment.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.620
I'm going another
five miles.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.455
Double or nothing,
no cheating.

00:54.488 --> 00:57.358
I will outlast you to Audubon
Park if it doesn't kill us both.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.430
Hey.

01:02.463 --> 01:03.531
You okay?

01:08.769 --> 01:10.371
I just need to...

01:18.412 --> 01:19.547
Gabriel.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.748
Hey, you all right?

01:20.781 --> 01:21.782
Gabe.

01:24.518 --> 01:27.721
Yes, I need an ambulance
at the steps at Jackson Square.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.524
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:30.558 --> 01:33.127
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:33.161 --> 01:35.429
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:35.463 --> 01:36.730
* How, how, how, how

01:36.764 --> 01:39.300
* Hey, hey

01:44.905 --> 01:46.507
* You gotta come on.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.543
MAN: Telling
you, Lasalle.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.545
Jumping out of a plane--
you got to try it.

01:51.579 --> 01:54.548
12,500 feet,
nothing but air.

01:54.582 --> 01:55.549
Oh, it's tempting.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.385
Wait, skydiving?

01:57.418 --> 01:59.387
Mike and Kieran are going
with some SEAL buddies.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.421
Let us know, Lasalle.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.689
You got it, fellas.

02:01.722 --> 02:02.790
I'm surprised
you've never been.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.758
I just never got
around to it.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.560
Plus, I got this vague
fear of heights.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.396
Well, it's not the height
you should be afraid of,

02:08.429 --> 02:09.397
it's the ground.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.764
Well, that's
my point.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.767
Skydiving sounds fun,
but sky-crashing-- not so much.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.303
Who's going
skydiving?

02:15.336 --> 02:17.905
Lasalle has
height issues.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.208
I said vague height issues.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.074
Must do, Christopher.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.876
Seeing the world
from up there gives you

02:22.910 --> 02:24.378
a whole nother perspective.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.280
GABRIEL: Besides,
whatever doesn't kill you

02:26.314 --> 02:27.415
makes you stronger.

02:27.448 --> 02:28.882
Lieutenant Commander Lin.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.718
Dwayne.
PRIDE: Thank you, Roy.

02:30.751 --> 02:33.254
I hope that you don't mind me
showing up unannounced.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.688
Of course not.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.590
Agent Brody,
Lieutenant Commander Lin.

02:36.624 --> 02:37.558
Nice to meet you.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.759
Chief naval therapist

02:38.792 --> 02:40.294
out of the facility
at Belle Chasse.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.296
So, what's with the gray
hair, old friend?

02:42.330 --> 02:43.297
What gray hair?

02:44.465 --> 02:45.566
How you doing?

02:45.599 --> 02:47.301
Could we talk
in private?

02:47.335 --> 02:48.336
Yeah, sure, come on.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.605
Uh, you still running?

02:51.639 --> 02:54.242
Oh, I get in a couple of miles
every other day or so. You?

02:54.275 --> 02:56.244
Good, good. Uh,
55 miles a week.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.578
Come on.
Yeah.

02:57.611 --> 03:01.349
I was gonna run the
Rouge-Orleans Ultra,

03:01.382 --> 03:04.252
but, uh, I collapsed
11 days ago.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.487
Nothing like that ever
happened to me before.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.389
I was rushed to the hospital,

03:08.422 --> 03:09.857
they did all
these tests,

03:09.890 --> 03:11.392
they couldn't figure
out what was going on.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.394
And then, uh,
they discover

03:13.427 --> 03:17.698
that I have unusually high
levels of radiation in my body.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.202
Polonium-210.

03:23.271 --> 03:26.240
Wait, is-isn't
that...

03:26.274 --> 03:29.310
that what was used to kill
Alexander Litvinenko?

03:29.343 --> 03:31.312
Yeah, the ex-KGB spy.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.347
And, if you believe it,
Yasser Arafat.

03:35.349 --> 03:39.620
250,000 times more toxic
than hydrogen cyanide.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.523
So...

03:43.757 --> 03:45.393
There's no cure.

03:48.329 --> 03:51.599
Dwayne, I think
I've been poisoned.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.903
So I'm here today to
ask you for a favor.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.806
Find your killer
before it's too late.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.387
We are so sorry.

04:13.421 --> 04:16.790
Well, I appreciate that, ma'am,
but I don't need sympathy.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.792
I need answers.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.795
And the first thing I should
say is I'm not contagious.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.798
The only way you can get
sick is to ingest it.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.034
Which means,
if you were actually poisoned,

04:27.067 --> 04:29.837
whoever did this had
direct access to you.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.505
Uh, yeah, so
I made a list.

04:33.874 --> 04:37.077
Of patients, current and former.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.513
A colleague whose
thesis I ripped apart

04:39.547 --> 04:40.748
during my peer
review days.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.350
LASALLE: As for
your personal life,

04:42.383 --> 04:43.884
is there anyone
we should be looking at?

04:43.917 --> 04:45.886
Well, that suggests
that I have a personal life.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.922
I've got office hours 9:00
to 7:00, seminars at night.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.526
Writing a book.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.562
You need to give us everything.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.564
Any suspicion.
Yeah.

04:56.597 --> 05:00.568
The wider the net, the more
likely we can hit upon a lead.

05:00.601 --> 05:01.602
Sure.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.742
Do you know what scares me?

05:10.911 --> 05:14.882
I consider myself to be a
really good judge of character.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.917
That's what I do.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.922
But nobody I can think of
is capable of...

05:24.925 --> 05:26.927
...this.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.937
Okay, we're on it.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.372
Start with the list, huh?

05:38.406 --> 05:39.907
We'll run down
the names.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.875
See if we can find anyone
who has access to polonium.

05:41.909 --> 05:42.876
Appreciate it.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.645
Thank you both.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.079
As for the first part,

05:46.113 --> 05:48.549
the access part,

05:48.582 --> 05:51.552
see if we can't
figure out the where

05:51.585 --> 05:53.621
and when this
happened.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.623
As for the where,
well...

05:55.656 --> 05:58.626
you need to give us a record
of everywhere you frequently go.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.827
Okay.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.730
And as for the when,

06:02.763 --> 06:03.797
let's go see an
old friend.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.937
What we're doing is testing
your organ functions.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.940
By comparing them
with the decay

06:12.973 --> 06:17.110
typically associated
with polonium exposure,

06:17.144 --> 06:20.147
we'll be able to determine
when the poisoning occurred.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.654
Can release
your hand now.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.055
So what is this process?

06:28.088 --> 06:29.990
What is this process?

06:30.023 --> 06:32.125
Yeah, does it
have a name?

06:32.159 --> 06:34.662
Oh, would you
hold still, please?

06:34.695 --> 06:38.031
Stall by answering my question
with a question.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.001
Avoid eye contact, try
to change the subject

06:41.034 --> 06:43.504
by refocusing
on the examination.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.539
What is it you don't
want to tell me?

06:47.575 --> 06:51.712
What we are performing here
is called a live autopsy.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.851
Yes, I can see why
that would be uncomfortable.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.089
This might be
a little cold.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.999
Let me ask you
something.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.603
How does this illness progress?

07:15.636 --> 07:18.706
Your doctors haven't told you?

07:18.739 --> 07:21.208
I really didn't ask.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.778
The, uh, first few days
were such a whirlwind

07:24.812 --> 07:26.780
that there was so much
information being spit at me.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.816
Radiation levels,
mortality rates.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.520
I didn't hear much
of what was said.

07:32.553 --> 07:36.524
And then when it finally
started to sink in, I...

07:36.557 --> 07:39.527
I really didn't want to know.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.961
Denial.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.162
It's good for the patients.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.064
It's great
for the therapist, too.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.901
So you want to know now?

07:47.935 --> 07:49.937
No, I don't want to know now.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.374
But I think I should.

07:58.245 --> 08:02.215
There will be migraines,
nausea, extreme pain.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.218
In about a week, you will
start to lose your hair.

08:05.252 --> 08:08.789
And over the course
of the next week or so,

08:08.822 --> 08:12.960
all your major organs
will begin to shut down.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.629
And then I die?

08:22.670 --> 08:25.673
I liked it better
when I was in denial.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.946
You have anyone
who can help you out?

08:32.980 --> 08:34.948
Take care of you?

08:34.982 --> 08:37.150
I've got
some good friends.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.152
And you got a
brother, yes?

08:39.186 --> 08:41.154
An older brother,
Cam.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.156
We haven't been
close recently.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.159
Um, you know, we're
kind of at odds.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.762
Dad died
a few months back.

08:48.796 --> 08:49.963
Cancer.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.799
Sorry, I didn't...

08:51.832 --> 08:54.334
Cam took care of him when
I was stationed in Afghanistan.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.336
And he thinks I didn't
do enough to help.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.972
We haven't talked
in two months.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.942
Uh, and I have to
ask then, if...

09:01.975 --> 09:05.679
Should your brother have been
on that list that you gave us?

09:05.713 --> 09:06.947
No, no, Cam didn't
do this.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.216
Remember what
you told me?

09:09.249 --> 09:10.851
Years ago.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.185
About what you discovered
about your father.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.887
I've said a lot of things.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.956
You said knowing the truth
about your family

09:15.989 --> 09:18.792
and knowing what to do with that
truth are two different things.

09:18.826 --> 09:21.194
My brother can be
a very difficult man,

09:21.228 --> 09:23.631
but he is not
a killer.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.666
That I know.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.370
Some people have
a bucket list,

09:30.403 --> 09:32.005
I have
a bucket binder.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.243
You mean, literally,
a binder.

09:36.276 --> 09:39.246
Yeah, 983 different activities.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.248
Let's see...

09:41.281 --> 09:43.817
Journey past
the Pinwheel Galaxy,

09:43.851 --> 09:46.820
solve the Pollock octahedral
numbers conjecture,

09:46.854 --> 09:48.822
and, of course, beat Contra
without the up-up-down-down,

09:48.856 --> 09:51.659
left-right-left-right-
B-A-start cheat code.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.093
Which might be
the toughest thing on here.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.227
"Visit Utah"?

09:54.261 --> 09:55.262
Yeah, you know,
it's just...

09:55.295 --> 09:56.997
it's so square,

09:57.030 --> 09:58.231
but then there's this tiny
extra rectangle piece

09:58.265 --> 09:59.399
right at the top.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.734
What's the deal
with that thing?

10:00.768 --> 10:02.269
Polonium

10:02.302 --> 10:04.672
Polonium-210,
yes, great point.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.307
So, it's made
by nuclear reactors,

10:07.340 --> 10:09.810
but it has numerous
industrial capabilities.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.112
And even though it's been used
in government assassinations,

10:12.145 --> 10:14.114
it's not just available
to Big Brother.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.750
Which is why
I have this...

10:16.784 --> 10:18.852
home-brewed po-po.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.053
How did you...?

10:20.087 --> 10:21.989
Oh, well, this
anti-static fan,

10:22.022 --> 10:24.692
it's, uh, designed to reduce
imbalanced electrical charges.

10:24.725 --> 10:28.862
It uses 31,500 microcuries
of polonium

10:28.896 --> 10:30.197
as a power source.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.699
That's ten lethal doses.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.266
With proper lab experience,

10:33.300 --> 10:35.002
you can purchase a fan
like this online

10:35.035 --> 10:36.169
and extract the
polonium yourself.
Oh!

10:36.203 --> 10:37.270
I got it! I got it!

10:37.304 --> 10:40.207
Oh, you seriously need
supervision.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.775
Okay, now we know
what polonium is.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.443
How do we find out
where Dr. Lin was poisoned?

10:43.476 --> 10:46.179
A Geiger counter.

10:46.213 --> 10:49.116
This puppy will clickety-clack
whenever it's near the stuff.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.884
Look at this.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.319
LASALLE:
How long is it detectable?

10:52.352 --> 10:53.921
Well, polonium's not
the kind of thing

10:53.954 --> 10:55.188
you just wash off
with Ajax and bleach.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.890
It hangs around.
Okay.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.792
We'll get this back to you
before the Utah trip.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.160
All right. Mm-hmm.
Thanks, Sebastian.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.229
Provo or bust!

11:11.204 --> 11:12.940
Agent Brody.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.075
Dr. Wilkins.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.209
You're in New Orleans?

11:16.243 --> 11:18.278
I got reassigned
from South Carolina.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.814
Been seeing patients out
of this office for three weeks,

11:20.848 --> 11:23.250
and then, well,
what happened with Dr. Lin.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.219
I've had to cancel
all my clients.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.922
Is it safe?

11:28.956 --> 11:30.257
No signs of polonium.

11:30.290 --> 11:31.959
Crazy.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.827
I haven't even gotten settled,

11:33.861 --> 11:35.996
and one of my colleagues
is being poisoned.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.297
Hey, uh,

11:37.330 --> 11:38.766
I was thinking
of calling you.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.935
I would love to pick the brain

11:41.969 --> 11:43.804
of another recent transplant.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.807
Okay, sure.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.308
Great.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.743
Agent Lasalle.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.278
How you doing, Doc?

11:51.311 --> 11:52.212
Good, thank you.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.181
Well,

11:54.214 --> 11:56.784
uh, back to the salt mines,
I guess.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.955
The room is clear.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.994
Why are you so smiley?

12:07.027 --> 12:08.929
I'm not smiling.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.331
Oh, yeah, you're smiley.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.268
That's just my face, Lasalle.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.537
Well, you might have
a medical condition, Brody.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.906
I'll get it checked out.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.875
Found this in Lin's files.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.945
Dominick Cole,
former patient of Gabriel's.

12:24.978 --> 12:27.547
Dominick was a gunner's
mate for the coast guard.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.282
Chemicals and
weapons specialist

12:29.316 --> 12:31.885
who broke bad after
two tours in Afghanistan

12:31.919 --> 12:33.420
and went full Unabomber.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.356
Brilliant but unstable.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.791
Paranoid and anti-government.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.860
His C.O. sends him in
for a psych eval.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.862
Where he meets Dr. Lin,
who's navy?

12:41.895 --> 12:44.364
Yeah, the coast guard
doesn't have its own psych team,

12:44.397 --> 12:46.099
so they bogart the navy's.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.567
According to the file,

12:47.600 --> 12:50.237
Dr. Lin recommended
his discharge.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.306
Didn't sit too well
with Dominick.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.475
Polonium connection.

12:55.508 --> 12:59.112
About a month ago, he got
himself on a watch list

12:59.146 --> 13:02.149
after he purchased polonium-
making materials online.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.583
Got an address?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.185
Guy's off the gridsy.

13:05.218 --> 13:08.288
Wait, this guy was
coast guard, right?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.958
Yep.

13:10.991 --> 13:13.326
Admit it, you guys got
a little teary when I left.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.263
Made up this whole polonium case
just so you could have me back.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.331
We have been crying
ourselves to sleep.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.900
Didn't know what
to do without you.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.334
Good to see you again,
Agent Borin.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.003
You got something for us?

13:23.036 --> 13:25.172
Yeah, like I told Agent Brody,

13:25.205 --> 13:27.074
we've been monitoring
Dominick Cole

13:27.107 --> 13:28.275
since he left the coast guard.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.143
Now, here, his last
known whereabouts

13:30.177 --> 13:32.479
are near the Industrial Canal

13:32.512 --> 13:33.914
east of the Lower Nine.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.482
Let's pay him a visit.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.284
I know you didn't fly
all the way down here

13:37.317 --> 13:38.886
just to give us an address.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.620
No, I flew all the way
back down here

13:40.653 --> 13:42.222
because we've been waiting
for Dominick to screw up

13:42.255 --> 13:43.857
so we could get
our hands on him.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.458
Our case, our hands.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.994
You just watch.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.596
I like to watch.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.010
PRIDE:
Easy, everybody.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.112
On my lead.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.321
There he is. Christopher,

14:14.354 --> 14:16.623
side door. Borin, with me.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.330
Dominick Cole, NCIS.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.465
Open up.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.105
He's running!

14:32.139 --> 14:33.340
Guys, get out!

14:33.373 --> 14:35.342
Bomb!
Go, go, go!

14:58.065 --> 15:01.134
Damn it!

15:01.168 --> 15:02.269
Brody, we'll take his tail.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.470
You cut him off.

15:03.503 --> 15:04.404
Let's go.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.645
LASALLE:
We're right behind him.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.590
Brody, where are you?
BRODY: On the south side.
We're coming around.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.269
It's a dead end
around that corner.

15:39.772 --> 15:40.673
Stay on him.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.515
We got him.

15:48.548 --> 15:49.482
Federal agents!

15:53.253 --> 15:54.087
Here we go again.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.055
Go, go!

16:05.398 --> 16:07.534
BRODY:
Where's he going?

16:07.567 --> 16:09.502
PRIDE: Back of the plant.
On our way!

16:12.305 --> 16:13.673
Go left.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.992
Stay down! Don't move!

16:35.728 --> 16:37.097
Hands where we can see.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.098
Easy.
Get against the car.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.132
Turn around.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.571
Hey, Dominick.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.074
Pleasure to finally meet you.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.109
I don't think
the feeling's mutual.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.057
BORIN:
Dominick.

17:04.091 --> 17:05.392
Buddy.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.294
What do you have to say

17:07.327 --> 17:09.329
for yourself?
And might I suggest

17:09.362 --> 17:11.364
you start
with the word "polonium."

17:11.398 --> 17:13.066
Mm.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.204
Whistling "Dixie." Cute.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.838
But you realize the phrase
"whistling 'Dixie'"

17:18.871 --> 17:22.142
actually means to engage
in unrealistic fantasies.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.776
Like the fantasy

17:23.810 --> 17:25.212
that you're
not gonna spend

17:25.245 --> 17:27.614
the rest of your life
in a six-by-eight cell.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.216
Dominick.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.718
We found traces of polonium

17:31.751 --> 17:33.320
on your property.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.155
You laced your barbed wire fence
with that stuff.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.323
That's pretty nasty.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.625
You mix up another batch
of that?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.727
Use it to poison Dr. Lin?

17:43.463 --> 17:47.400
* Crazy for feeling so lonely.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.602
Good whistling.
I think

17:49.636 --> 17:51.338
a more appropriate choice

17:51.371 --> 17:52.639
would be...

17:53.740 --> 17:55.642
* The law won

17:55.675 --> 17:56.776
* I fought the law

17:56.809 --> 17:58.711
* And the law won.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.480
Ow!
Enough!

18:00.513 --> 18:02.315
I'm sorry, did you want
to say something?

18:02.349 --> 18:05.452
Dr. Lin was supposed
to make me better.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.155
Instead, he took away my job.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.322
My livelihood.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.890
I'm glad he's dying,

18:10.923 --> 18:12.292
but if I'd done it,

18:12.325 --> 18:15.262
he'd be
in a million crappy pieces.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.233
Dominick Cole may be
angry as all hell,

18:20.267 --> 18:21.401
but he's not
behind the polonium.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.202
Are you sure?

18:22.235 --> 18:24.371
Put your trust
in the periodic table.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.406
Polonium has isotopic impurities

18:26.439 --> 18:28.475
which gives each sample

18:28.508 --> 18:30.577
its own uniquely
identifiable fingerprint.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.379
And the polonium you found
at Dominick's

18:32.412 --> 18:34.381
has a completely different
isotopic structure

18:34.414 --> 18:36.316
than the samples
from Gabriel's body.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.418
They don't match.
That said,

18:38.451 --> 18:40.853
I've completed my diagnostics

18:40.887 --> 18:43.190
on Gabriel's
organ functions,

18:43.223 --> 18:45.825
and I've determined
when the poisoning occurred--

18:45.858 --> 18:47.427
approximately 15 days ago.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.728
The 27th.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.197
Which means...

18:50.230 --> 18:51.731
Find out where he was that day,

18:51.764 --> 18:53.500
and we'll know
where he was poisoned.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.805
Uh, Dwayne, something else.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.773
I made an additional finding.

19:00.807 --> 19:04.644
With Gabriel's kidneys and liver
deteriorating at these rates,

19:04.677 --> 19:07.280
I'm able to approximate
when his body

19:07.314 --> 19:10.283
will succumb to the poison.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.352
The day he'll die.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.721
If it were me, I'd like to know.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.970
So, did you look at it?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.373
Not my place.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.675
You know, the analytical
part of me wants to know.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.610
It's the first
step of coping.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.646
But...

19:40.980 --> 19:42.715
Knowing the date...

19:43.883 --> 19:46.353
Makes it real.

19:48.555 --> 19:51.258
So, how's the investigation?

19:51.291 --> 19:53.860
We've determined
you were poisoned

19:53.893 --> 19:55.928
on the 27th of last month.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.232
That was a Tuesday.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.433
Thanks.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.668
Where were you?

20:01.701 --> 20:02.602
Uh...

20:06.406 --> 20:09.376
Uh, well, I was at
my father's loft in the Quarter.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.677
We haven't sold it yet.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.645
Had dinner in the area,

20:12.679 --> 20:14.981
and I had a few drinks,
so I didn't want to drive home.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.484
I'm gonna need the address.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.718
And the restaurant, too.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.920
The loft is on Decatur, 600.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.290
And the restaurant is Irene's
on St. Philip.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.358
Who were you with?

20:25.392 --> 20:27.460
It was just myself.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.629
Okay.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.332
Dwayne.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.868
Just look at it.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.370
Why?

20:37.404 --> 20:38.538
So you can know the deadline

20:38.571 --> 20:40.239
to find out who did this to me.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.530
14 days is how long Dr. Lin has.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.964
Say it's you.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.300
You got two weeks.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.469
336 hours.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.804
A little over 20,000 minutes.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.974
Look at you, Rain Man.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.977
Seriously, though,
what would you do?

21:18.010 --> 21:19.779
Gather my family.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.948
Mom, brother and sister.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.816
Watch a Bama game.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.418
Spend as much time
with them as I could.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.653
Yeah, that's it?

21:26.686 --> 21:29.021
No last great adventure?

21:29.055 --> 21:30.823
If I want to do

21:30.857 --> 21:32.525
something, I do it.

21:32.559 --> 21:36.363
Spend every day
like you got two weeks left.

21:36.396 --> 21:39.566
How about you?
I'm doing it.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.334
Searching for polonium?

21:41.368 --> 21:42.602
No, spending time
with good people

21:42.635 --> 21:44.537
in a gorgeous New Orleans loft.

21:44.571 --> 21:47.607
And yeah, searching for

21:47.640 --> 21:49.876
deadly nuclear material.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.411
What can I say, Lasalle?

21:51.444 --> 21:54.447
Catching baddies,
it curls my toes.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.349
BRODY:
Guys.

21:56.383 --> 21:58.485
Got something.

22:03.690 --> 22:04.791
SEBASTIAN:
Killer injects

22:04.824 --> 22:06.426
polonium into the tube.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.627
Gabriel brushes his teeth

22:07.660 --> 22:08.961
sometime that Tuesday.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.663
Then... Wango Tango.

22:10.697 --> 22:11.898
How do you normally respond

22:11.931 --> 22:12.932
when he says stuff like that?

22:12.965 --> 22:14.901
Smile and nod.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.470
That's not entirely true.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.506
Sometimes you just look
at me like I'm an alien.

22:19.539 --> 22:22.475
Which I guess I don't
completely rule out.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.677
Anyway, uh, what's
cool is, by taking

22:24.711 --> 22:26.979
the polonium from Gabriel's
tissues and the sample

22:27.013 --> 22:29.115
from the toothpaste, I've been
able to draw some conclusions.

22:29.148 --> 22:32.084
The first-- neither one came
from an anti-static fan,

22:32.118 --> 22:34.587
but rather straight
from the source.

22:34.621 --> 22:37.023
A nuclear reactor?
Yeah, I can't tell you
exactly which one just yet.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.391
We have less than
a hundred microcuries.

22:38.425 --> 22:39.626
That's not enough

22:39.659 --> 22:41.828
to pinpoint its origin...
"Microcuries"?

22:41.861 --> 22:43.696
It's a measurement of
radioactivity. But I contacted

22:43.730 --> 22:45.398
a physicist friend of mine,

22:45.432 --> 22:47.700
and, uh, given its
chemical signature,

22:47.734 --> 22:49.402
it could only come
from a facility that has, uh,

22:49.436 --> 22:50.570
radiopharmaceutical
capabilities.

22:50.603 --> 22:51.771
There's only a few of those

22:51.804 --> 22:53.673
in the whole United States.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.409
I don't care what planet you're
from. I'm totally into it.

22:56.443 --> 22:59.145
Don't encourage him.
Let's go.
Thank you.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.623
I'm sorry! I thought
I'd be here sooner.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.792
But my mile time's

23:12.825 --> 23:14.627
40 seconds slower.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.062
It's okay.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.666
You have something?

23:21.668 --> 23:24.637
Why didn't you tell me
you and your brother Cam

23:24.671 --> 23:26.639
were involved in a land dispute?

23:29.642 --> 23:32.679
Your father's land in Taiwan?

23:32.712 --> 23:34.614
Cam's suing you for it?

23:34.647 --> 23:35.915
It's sentimental.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.116
It's not worth anything.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.752
Sure about that?

23:39.786 --> 23:42.088
Couple of things.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.723
When you told me
about your brother,

23:43.756 --> 23:46.025
sorry, but I had my
people look into him.

23:46.058 --> 23:49.161
We found the lawsuit...

23:49.195 --> 23:52.499
and interest from a company--
Omnicore Development.

23:52.532 --> 23:53.700
And your father's
property sits

23:53.733 --> 23:55.502
smack-dab in the
middle of an area

23:55.535 --> 23:56.803
that they're developing.

23:56.836 --> 24:00.239
Land value has
increased exponentially.

24:00.272 --> 24:01.808
Well, I did not know that.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.075
I'm betting your brother did.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.712
Also...

24:05.745 --> 24:08.748
we've narrowed down where the
polonium was manufactured.

24:08.781 --> 24:09.816
Yeah.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.751
One of the reactors

24:11.784 --> 24:14.220
has contracts with
an oil company.

24:14.253 --> 24:17.223
Polonium powers their drills.

24:17.256 --> 24:18.758
USP Oil?

24:18.791 --> 24:21.794
Where Cam works.

24:21.828 --> 24:24.831
What are you saying?

24:24.864 --> 24:27.700
I'm saying

24:27.734 --> 24:29.836
we need to pay a visit
to your brother.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.285
Poisoned?

24:46.318 --> 24:49.556
Is this some kind of scam
because of the land thing?!

24:49.589 --> 24:51.257
You've known me my whole life.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.893
Do you think that I would
make up that I was dying?

24:53.926 --> 24:56.262
You don't look sick to me.
WOMAN:
Honey, please.

24:56.295 --> 24:58.998
A few things need
to be cleared up.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.934
First... where were
you on the 27th?

25:01.968 --> 25:03.235
It was a Tuesday.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.304
Tuesday. I was...

25:05.337 --> 25:07.640
at the office,
in and out of meetings.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.676
Can anyone verify
your whereabouts?

25:09.709 --> 25:10.910
The whole day?!

25:10.943 --> 25:12.812
This is absurd.
No...

25:12.845 --> 25:14.647
what is absurd is you not
telling me that there was

25:14.681 --> 25:16.315
a developer interested
in Dad's land

25:16.348 --> 25:18.951
because the property value's
gone way up!

25:18.985 --> 25:21.287
I didn't know, Gabe!
You expect me to believe that?!

25:21.320 --> 25:23.823
You are brothers! Stop this!
Stay out of it, Dawn!

25:23.856 --> 25:25.157
This isn't coming
out of the blue.

25:25.191 --> 25:28.828
You have a key
to your father's loft.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.096
You have access to polonium.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.163
This is beneath you.

25:31.197 --> 25:33.132
You really want Dad's land?

25:33.165 --> 25:35.702
Maybe you should've been there
as he was lying in bed dying!

25:35.735 --> 25:37.036
I was halfway
around the world...

25:37.069 --> 25:39.338
:
...serving my country.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.173
Geez!
DAWN:
Oh, God.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.309
Can you give me something
for under his head?
Yeah.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.778
Come on. That's it.

25:45.812 --> 25:48.681
Thank you. Okay.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.117
You all right?

25:51.150 --> 25:53.085
Gabe.
Hey, hey, just breathe.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.087
I was, I'm just a little dizzy.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.595
He's really dying?

26:02.629 --> 26:03.863
Yes, he is.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.031
BRODY:
We'll need to search

26:05.064 --> 26:07.199
your house for polonium.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.168
Based on what?

26:09.201 --> 26:11.203
I haven't been anywhere
near my brother

26:11.237 --> 26:12.271
or my father's loft

26:12.304 --> 26:13.339
since my dad died.

26:13.372 --> 26:14.741
We checked your financials.

26:14.774 --> 26:15.975
You're cash-strapped.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.944
You lost $600,000

26:17.977 --> 26:19.879
in the stock market last year.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.280
That is a really big hit.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.783
BRODY:
Price of the land
in White Sand Bay

26:23.816 --> 26:25.818
has increased by 700%
in the last six months.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.086
I'm telling you

26:27.119 --> 26:28.287
I had no idea.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.057
I never talked to this Omnicore.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.825
Well, with your brother dead,

26:32.859 --> 26:34.994
that land is yours outright.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.296
And if I did poison him,
wouldn't it be pretty stupid

26:37.329 --> 26:39.365
to do it when we're
in the middle of a lawsuit?

26:39.398 --> 26:41.033
Or you count on us
thinking just that,

26:41.067 --> 26:43.602
and hope we can't trace
the poison to you.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.212
My brother...

26:53.245 --> 26:56.816
he thinks I did this?

26:56.849 --> 26:59.686
It's not important
what he believes.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.821
It is to me.

27:01.854 --> 27:04.190
You want access to my house,

27:04.223 --> 27:06.225
get a warrant.

27:06.258 --> 27:09.361
And tell my brother if he thinks
I'm capable of this,

27:09.395 --> 27:12.098
he doesn't have a clue
who I really am.

27:22.441 --> 27:25.845
You know, he was the runner
when we were younger.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.747
I used to wake up

27:27.780 --> 27:29.248
at 5:00 a.m.
and wait outside his door,

27:29.281 --> 27:33.119
and beg him to take me
to train with him.

27:33.152 --> 27:36.388
And then in high school
I kept going and he stopped.

27:39.391 --> 27:41.260
When was the last time

27:41.293 --> 27:43.830
you ran together?

27:45.998 --> 27:47.433
I can't remember.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.205
Do you believe him?

27:53.239 --> 27:56.208
Do you?

27:56.242 --> 27:58.978
I don't know what I believe

27:59.011 --> 28:01.380
about anything anymore.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.152
What do we got?

28:06.185 --> 28:07.887
Brody and Borin are
working on getting

28:07.920 --> 28:09.221
a warrant for Cam's house.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.323
In the meantime, I found out

28:11.357 --> 28:13.860
the Omnicore
development project?

28:13.893 --> 28:15.728
It's worth $300 million.

28:15.762 --> 28:17.429
That's a chunk of change.

28:17.463 --> 28:20.332
Omnicore is building
condos on two miles

28:20.366 --> 28:23.202
of pristine
beachfront property.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.436
And the Lin's family's land?

28:24.470 --> 28:26.305
It's right smack-dab
in the middle.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.507
So, without the Lin's property?

28:28.540 --> 28:31.010
Project goes nowhere.

28:31.043 --> 28:34.413
Can we tie Omnicore to Cam?

28:34.446 --> 28:37.516
They've got offices in the
Central Business District.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.485
Got to believe they've
reached out at some point.

28:39.518 --> 28:42.955
I'll drive.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.390
MAN:
Cam Lin?

28:44.423 --> 28:45.391
Never heard of him.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.493
Sure about that,
Mr. Zarate?

28:47.526 --> 28:50.262
He and his brother Gabriel
have property in Taiwan

28:50.296 --> 28:52.298
that appears to be very
important to your company.

28:52.331 --> 28:53.532
I wouldn't know.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.401
Development is below
my pay grade.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.770
I'm more of a big picture guy.

28:57.804 --> 28:59.071
Then how about
putting us in touch

28:59.105 --> 29:01.073
with the little picture guys

29:01.107 --> 29:03.843
who can tell us if your company
and Mr. Lin have had contact.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.544
I'm not inclined nor compelled

29:05.577 --> 29:07.279
to discuss current projects.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.748
Even if it involves
a murder investigation?

29:11.818 --> 29:13.786
We were cleared of that.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.455
Local officials in Sochi
who were shot?

29:16.488 --> 29:17.924
Nothing more
than trumped up charges

29:17.957 --> 29:19.525
by the Russian government out

29:19.558 --> 29:21.994
to make an American company
look ruthless.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.334
That's... that's not
what you're here about?

29:28.367 --> 29:30.903
It is now.

29:32.204 --> 29:34.406
My lawyers will
take it from here.

29:43.549 --> 29:44.817
Agent Brody?

29:44.851 --> 29:46.819
Hey. What's going on?

29:46.853 --> 29:48.220
Uh, I spoke to Dr. Lin.

29:48.254 --> 29:51.223
He said you were looking
into his brother Cam?

29:51.257 --> 29:53.025
I saw him.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.360
A couple weeks ago.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.328
I was leaving the building
and Cam was

29:56.362 --> 29:57.897
just parked outside our office.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.999
I didn't know
if that was important.

30:00.032 --> 30:02.234
It is. Thank you.

30:02.268 --> 30:05.537
You could've just
called with that.

30:05.571 --> 30:08.074
Yeah, but then wouldn't
have had the opportunity

30:08.107 --> 30:10.576
to follow up
on that coffee idea.

30:10.609 --> 30:13.245
Well, you-you've got
my number

30:13.279 --> 30:15.081
from the Neville case.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.348
You let me know?

30:16.382 --> 30:19.251
Yeah. Sure.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.887
Good.
Just spoke with Cam's supervisor

30:20.920 --> 30:23.522
at USP.

30:24.556 --> 30:26.058
Sorry, am I interrupting?

30:26.092 --> 30:28.961
No.
I was just leaving.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.332
Cam supervises maintenance
of the drills.

30:33.365 --> 30:35.501
That gives him
direct access to polonium.

30:35.534 --> 30:38.637
And he lied about not being
anywhere near Dr. Lin.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.606
Should be pretty easy
to get a warrant now.

30:40.639 --> 30:42.541
I'll double back with the judge.
You call Pride.

30:42.574 --> 30:43.876
You got it.

30:48.447 --> 30:49.982
That guy was cute.

30:50.016 --> 30:52.251
I guess.

30:52.284 --> 30:55.187
Is he your boyfriend?

30:57.489 --> 30:59.291
Is he gay?

30:59.325 --> 31:00.326
I don't think so.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.493
Okay, so...

31:01.527 --> 31:04.130
what's the problem?

31:04.163 --> 31:06.432
I don't date.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.600
Neither do I,
but that shouldn't stop you

31:08.634 --> 31:10.602
from having a little fun.

31:12.338 --> 31:15.174
Okay, let's just say
I have, um...

31:15.207 --> 31:16.608
relationship issues.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.277
Don't we all.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.379
Okay, then you get it.
Sometimes you just...

31:20.412 --> 31:22.448
you know, you need to...

31:22.481 --> 31:24.316
keep your distance.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.587
Yeah, until...

31:28.620 --> 31:31.357
one day someone doses you
with polonium

31:31.390 --> 31:34.193
and you're wondering what
the hell you were running from.

31:38.965 --> 31:41.067
It's just funny how
you didn't mention

31:41.100 --> 31:42.935
you went to your
brother's office.

31:42.969 --> 31:44.603
I never went inside.

31:44.636 --> 31:47.239
Never saw him.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.474
So why'd you go there?

31:48.507 --> 31:50.609
Talk about
the lawsuit.

31:50.642 --> 31:53.479
I thought we could
maybe work it out.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.948
But I had second
thoughts, so I left.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.385
How long is this all
gonna take, anyway?

31:59.418 --> 32:00.586
Long as it takes.

32:00.619 --> 32:03.522
Nothing upstairs.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.658
There's a garage out back.
I'll check that.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.967
BORIN:
DeGeorge, huh?
DAWN:
Oh.

32:15.001 --> 32:17.603
Yeah, my father.
He owns a plastics company.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.105
He sends me these things.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.507
Wants me to know
the products.

32:21.540 --> 32:22.708
That sounds exciting.

32:22.741 --> 32:25.311
Yeah, you know that line
from The Graduate?

32:25.344 --> 32:27.413
"Plastics"?

32:27.446 --> 32:28.747
My life.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.482
Um...
Ms. Lin, I...

32:30.516 --> 32:32.284
Do you really think

32:32.318 --> 32:34.686
my husband
could do this?

32:36.622 --> 32:39.225
I'm gonna need you to
go back in the house.

33:01.413 --> 33:02.981
Where you going?

33:04.050 --> 33:05.751
Get a drink of water.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.386
That a problem?

33:20.599 --> 33:21.633
Wait!

33:24.136 --> 33:25.437
What's going on?

33:29.275 --> 33:31.677
Bingo.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.669
God, if I had one sip...

33:57.703 --> 33:59.671
If either of us had a sip...

33:59.705 --> 34:01.840
Um, how is it...
how is it possible

34:01.873 --> 34:04.776
for someone to gain
access to our water?

34:04.810 --> 34:06.212
Where's it kept?

34:06.245 --> 34:07.779
When's it delivered?

34:07.813 --> 34:09.215
They're delivered
every two weeks.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.482
They sit outside the house.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.318
King.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.353
I need you outside.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.388
Stay here, please.

34:16.422 --> 34:17.556
DAWN:
Oh, God.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.825
It's gonna be okay.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.362
Neighbor's security camera

34:23.395 --> 34:24.596
caught a piece
of the Lin's driveway.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.432
There. See that car?

34:26.465 --> 34:28.267
Got the license plate,
but not a driver.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.668
Already ran it.

34:29.701 --> 34:30.836
Belongs to an employee
of Omnicore Development.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.771
Omnicore's been to the house.

34:33.872 --> 34:35.674
Sebastian.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.343
All right, get a 20 on Zarate.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.345
Call the judge,
get more warrants.

34:39.378 --> 34:42.148
See if we can't tie
polonium to Omnicore.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.449
You got it.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.753
Everything all right, Sebastian?

34:47.786 --> 34:49.521
Things are more than all right,
Agent Pride.

34:49.555 --> 34:51.523
Things are actually
very exciting.

34:51.557 --> 34:53.359
I had to take a moment
and calm myself

34:53.392 --> 34:54.760
until we could speak.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.862
Well, I'm here now,
so speak.

34:56.895 --> 34:58.330
Okay.

34:58.364 --> 35:00.732
This is the polonium

35:00.766 --> 35:02.468
that I extracted
from the toothpaste,

35:02.501 --> 35:04.270
and this is
the polonium

35:04.303 --> 35:05.771
from the water bottle
that you had sent over.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.573
There's significantly more.

35:07.606 --> 35:12.378
Which allowed me to isolate
its distinct energy signature.

35:12.411 --> 35:13.779
It was produced by

35:13.812 --> 35:15.447
the South River Nuclear
Generating Station,

35:15.481 --> 35:17.749
and they only have one
polonium-210 client.

35:17.783 --> 35:20.552
Omnicore.
Incorrect.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.455
Then who?

35:37.403 --> 35:39.505
Ms. Lin. How we doing?

35:39.538 --> 35:41.173
Fine.

35:41.207 --> 35:42.674
Got a Prius
registered in your name.

35:42.708 --> 35:44.176
Is this a rental?

35:44.210 --> 35:46.278
Yeah, mine's having issues.

35:46.312 --> 35:47.546
Issues like what?

35:47.579 --> 35:49.448
It's not discreet enough

35:49.481 --> 35:51.417
to transport
radioactive material?

35:51.450 --> 35:53.185
Mind if we
take a look?
Sure, but...

35:53.219 --> 35:54.586
Step aside, please.
I don't... I don't know...

35:54.620 --> 35:56.388
What we're talking about?

35:56.422 --> 35:58.257
We hear that a lot.

36:01.593 --> 36:02.828
PRIDE:
Ms. Lin...

36:02.861 --> 36:06.398
as it turns out,
the polonium

36:06.432 --> 36:10.369
we found at your house
was only sold to one company:

36:10.402 --> 36:13.439
DeGeorge Plastics.

36:13.472 --> 36:15.707
Plastics.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.281
Got her.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.454
Omnicore came by your house.

36:28.487 --> 36:31.290
Offered you a big
payday for the land.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.459
Chance to change your life.

36:33.492 --> 36:34.760
LASALLE:
Poisoned your brother-in-law

36:34.793 --> 36:37.296
so you wouldn't have
to split the sale.

36:37.329 --> 36:39.365
Once we started
looking at Cam,

36:39.398 --> 36:40.866
you realized
he'd contact Omnicore,

36:40.899 --> 36:42.501
figure out
you were behind it.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.836
Two birds,
one radioactive stone.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.311
I thought marrying Cam
would mean

36:52.344 --> 36:54.980
I wouldn't have to live at
the beck and call of my father,

36:55.013 --> 37:01.387
and then Cam makes all these
crappy investments, and...

37:01.420 --> 37:04.256
right back to where I started.

37:04.290 --> 37:06.625
I think you've dropped
a few rungs.

37:13.532 --> 37:15.000
My kind of coffee.

37:15.033 --> 37:17.603
Kind of tastes
like mud.

37:17.636 --> 37:20.639
Not if you add
a little bourbon to it.

37:22.508 --> 37:24.576
Off to Virginia?

37:24.610 --> 37:27.413
For now.

37:27.446 --> 37:31.750
I've been thinking about
your friend, the, uh, doctor.

37:31.783 --> 37:34.052
Really makes one wonder.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.622
About?

37:36.655 --> 37:39.725
Professional roads
not taken.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.893
I love

37:41.927 --> 37:43.462
the United States Coast Guard,

37:43.495 --> 37:44.996
and I love being out
on the high seas,

37:45.030 --> 37:46.665
but every
now and again,

37:46.698 --> 37:49.435
I think...

37:49.468 --> 37:51.670
what if I did
something different?

37:52.971 --> 37:54.573
Like what?

37:54.606 --> 37:57.509
I'm told that
with eight weeks' training

37:57.543 --> 38:00.679
I could transfer
from CGIS to NCIS.

38:00.712 --> 38:03.014
In Washington

38:03.048 --> 38:06.585
More like anywhere I can get
a crappy cup of coffee

38:06.618 --> 38:08.420
I can spike with bourbon.

38:09.721 --> 38:12.358
Till next time, okay?

38:19.731 --> 38:21.400
KIERAN:
You ready for this, Lasalle?

38:21.433 --> 38:23.369
LASALLE:
It's on like Donkey Kong.

38:23.402 --> 38:25.771
Skydiving.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.106
I'll meet you guys out there.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.708
You're really going for it.
Yeah.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.543
You know, why put off
till tomorrow

38:31.577 --> 38:32.844
what you can do today?

38:32.878 --> 38:34.045
Ain't that the truth.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.614
Wish me luck.

38:35.647 --> 38:36.848
Don't hit the ground, Lasalle.

38:36.882 --> 38:39.585
I'll do my best not to.

38:44.055 --> 38:46.057
*

38:51.663 --> 38:52.964
WILKINS : You've
reached Dr. Samuel Wilkins.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.566
Leave a message and
I'll get back to you.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.634
So...

38:57.969 --> 38:59.571
About that coffee.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.607
* Heart on the run

39:01.640 --> 39:03.775
* Keeps a hand on a gun

39:03.809 --> 39:06.612
* Can't trust anyone

39:09.548 --> 39:11.950
* I was so sure

39:11.983 --> 39:13.919
* What I needed was more...

39:13.952 --> 39:15.554
How you doing?

39:17.656 --> 39:19.525
That my wife could do this...

39:21.026 --> 39:22.628
How do you...

39:22.661 --> 39:25.764
does someone even process
something like that?

39:25.797 --> 39:28.634
Well, at least you got
a good therapist in the family.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.636
Why, thank you very much.

39:30.669 --> 39:32.638
You are more than welcome.

39:32.671 --> 39:35.941
It's beautiful here, isn't it?

39:35.974 --> 39:39.144
It's my favorite place
to run in the city, right here.

39:39.177 --> 39:40.946
It reminds me
of Dad's land,

39:40.979 --> 39:42.714
in Taiwan.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.616
It's...

39:44.650 --> 39:47.185
this beautiful
stretch of beach.

39:47.218 --> 39:49.120
Water crystal clear.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.156
Feels like...

39:51.189 --> 39:54.493
warm silk on your skin.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.665
Wish we had the time
to go there.

40:05.136 --> 40:07.506
So I guess this is good-bye.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.911
Go.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.015
Run.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.153
* Cover me up

40:22.187 --> 40:25.557
* And know you're enough...
