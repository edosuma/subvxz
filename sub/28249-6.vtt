WEBVTT

00:04.352 --> 00:06.571
Previously on "The Village".

00:06.615 --> 00:07.896
- You're pregnant?
- I was gonna tell you.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.270
Three lies in three minutes.

00:09.313 --> 00:10.508
Ron has a right
to know his granddaughter.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.229
Olivia is not his. She's mine.

00:12.273 --> 00:14.164
- Have you tried the cannoli?
- I make 'em better.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.885
Wait! I didn't get your name!

00:15.928 --> 00:17.123
What do you say we compromise?

00:17.147 --> 00:19.628
- First name only.
- Gwendolina.

00:19.671 --> 00:20.846
Sophia.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.346
Do you know that half
the files on my desk

00:22.370 --> 00:24.087
are people that
your father's firm has bullied

00:24.111 --> 00:25.286
onto the street?

00:25.329 --> 00:26.678
I want you to move in with me.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.419
- Rule is...
- Don't tell your teammates

00:28.463 --> 00:30.030
you're dating your
dead friend's wife?

00:30.073 --> 00:32.162
I want to tell them.
We should tell Katie tonight.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.817
I just need a little more
time, get my head straight.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.253
Dads don't have to be strong.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.081
Dads just have to love.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.909
And I know you can love.

02:11.479 --> 02:14.525
I've always wondered how
an ankle bracelet would feel.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.614
You'll have to let me know.

02:23.447 --> 02:26.885
I was just stargazing for class.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.845
Ooh, I love astronomy.

02:29.888 --> 02:32.978
What's the assignment?

02:33.022 --> 02:35.851
Tracking all of the things.

02:35.894 --> 02:39.071
Divulge, felon.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.725
I'm going to paint something.

02:40.769 --> 02:43.206
Ooh, fun.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.468
I'll meet you downstairs.

02:44.512 --> 02:45.991
What? No!

02:46.035 --> 02:47.123
No, no, no, no!

02:52.737 --> 02:54.913
Something about
this city at night.

02:54.957 --> 02:58.482
Electric,
memories thick in the air.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.223
I think that's pee.

03:00.267 --> 03:03.313
- Don't harsh my mellow, girl.
- Sorry.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.402
Evolution really let
pregnant women down

03:05.446 --> 03:06.838
with this whole smell thing.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.014
It's like your own body's
turned against you.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.930
I know the feeling.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.497
How are you?

03:14.411 --> 03:16.587
Scared. A little sick.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.894
Worried about what's
growing inside me.

03:18.937 --> 03:21.157
You?

03:21.201 --> 03:23.899
Scared. A little sick.

03:23.942 --> 03:26.206
Worried about what's growing
inside of me.

03:26.249 --> 03:29.600
Birds of a feather, you and me.

03:29.644 --> 03:31.820
I knew that the moment
you walked into the building

03:31.863 --> 03:33.082
with your mom.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.867
Five years old,
soaking wet from the rain.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.522
I said, "Can I help you?"

03:38.566 --> 03:40.220
And before she could
say anything,

03:40.263 --> 03:43.310
you looked up and you said,
"My mother needs a home."

03:45.399 --> 03:47.705
I knew we'd be tight.

03:47.749 --> 03:50.665
And here we are
all those years later.

03:50.708 --> 03:54.364
I can't think of anyone
I'd rather do hard time with.

03:54.408 --> 03:55.931
Where's the spray paint?

03:55.974 --> 03:57.715
That stuff is toxic.

03:57.759 --> 04:00.196
But this is pregnant
lady friendly

04:00.240 --> 04:01.520
and doesn't cause
global warming.

04:01.545 --> 04:02.938
Rebel with a cause.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.374
Here, cover your face.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.898
- For what?
- That security camera.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.075
What?

04:25.874 --> 04:27.789
Hey, Patricia!

04:27.832 --> 04:29.486
Wake up, baby.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.401
It's a beautiful day.

04:31.445 --> 04:34.186
- What time is it?
- It's time to celebrate.

04:34.230 --> 04:38.190
Look at this.
Get that out of my face, Ron.

04:38.234 --> 04:40.628
No, it's Olivia. She's coming.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.370
She's coming
and she's bringing friends.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.721
The first gospel Sunday
at Smalls is a go.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.636
And look at this.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.378
Followers. All kinds of them.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.075
I'm gonna tweet.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.598
I will do the tweeting.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.470
You get champagne and juice

04:56.513 --> 04:58.776
for which we will
charge real money.

04:58.820 --> 05:02.476
Okay.
Baby, when did you get dressed?

05:04.391 --> 05:07.872
I must have sleep walked
in the night.

05:07.916 --> 05:08.873
Go buy booze, man.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.006
We got a granddaughter
to impress.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.983
- Good morning, sunshine.
- Good morning.

05:32.027 --> 05:33.637
Painting in your sleep?

05:33.681 --> 05:36.336
Your hands.

05:36.379 --> 05:39.164
Yeah, dreamt about a rainbow.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.383
Must have been real.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.906
Spit.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.821
But I'm still brushing my teeth.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.911
Prepare to translate.

05:56.443 --> 05:59.663
- Hey.
- Hey back.

05:59.707 --> 06:03.188
Hey. What are you doing?

06:03.232 --> 06:06.104
I was just gonna ask
Sarah if she'd mind

06:06.148 --> 06:07.671
walking Jedi.

06:07.715 --> 06:10.631
I overslept and I told Ron
I'd work his gospel thing.

06:10.674 --> 06:12.807
I actually volunteered
to help, too.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.591
Apparently he got
swamped yesterday.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.378
Nick, can I talk to you?

06:18.421 --> 06:20.031
Yeah.

06:27.082 --> 06:30.302
You were supposed
to come over last night.

06:30.346 --> 06:31.913
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

06:31.956 --> 06:34.785
I texted. And I called.

06:34.829 --> 06:36.831
I fell asleep
with the ringer off.

06:36.874 --> 06:40.443
Perfect storm.
Nick, I was worried.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.534
I'm okay.

06:45.622 --> 06:47.232
How'd it go with Katie?

06:47.276 --> 06:49.278
We didn't tell her.

06:49.321 --> 06:51.628
Did you see Deacon?

06:51.672 --> 06:53.587
No, he wasn't at group.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.720
Amy, I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.330
I justl really gotta
get down there.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.423
Kiss me.

07:10.952 --> 07:13.476
Make it up to me now.
Kate, I can't.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.086
I can't.

07:21.310 --> 07:24.444
I'll swing by later.
Gonna run some errands.

07:24.487 --> 07:25.967
Go.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.417
- You're busted.
- I should have stayed.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.419
Half of everything is fate,
Sami.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.726
But, yeah, that was a bad call.

07:45.769 --> 07:47.205
What's fate?

07:47.249 --> 07:49.556
When the universe
hands you something.

07:49.599 --> 07:50.861
Like a toy?

07:50.905 --> 07:55.431
Like a beautiful woman
named Gwendolina

07:55.475 --> 07:58.173
sitting down with you
for a cannoli.

07:58.216 --> 08:01.524
- Yuck.
- Well, give it 80 years.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.309
Is she your girlfriend?

08:04.353 --> 08:07.312
She would be if I
had gotten her full name.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.272
I lost her.

08:10.315 --> 08:13.493
Ben's a policeman. He can help.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.018
You're a genius, kid.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.716
You're a terrible gambler,
but you're a genius.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.157
Knock, knock.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.204
In the living room.

08:31.815 --> 08:35.515
- Is Sami with Enzo?
- How did you know?

08:36.645 --> 08:38.474
Might have arranged it.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.259
I was hoping for
a chance to talk.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.394
Can I sit?

08:46.003 --> 08:47.483
Sure.

08:54.621 --> 08:58.146
You didn't give me much of
a chance to explain last night.

08:58.886 --> 09:01.192
What's there to explain?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.631
I don't like the idea
of sleeping with a married man.

09:04.674 --> 09:07.285
Ava, I haven't seen her
for two years.

09:07.329 --> 09:08.896
We made a clean break.

09:08.939 --> 09:11.202
Just not an official one.

09:11.986 --> 09:14.031
After we lost Derek,
neither one of us

09:14.075 --> 09:16.512
had any energy for lawyers,
proceedings.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.035
And now?

09:18.732 --> 09:20.429
I pay the health benefits.

09:20.472 --> 09:23.737
I send her some money because
it didn't get done officially.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.523
Are you still attached?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.177
Only on paper.

09:30.613 --> 09:33.529
I've moved on.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.922
To you.

09:40.754 --> 09:43.321
Ava, I love you.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.944
I love you, too.

10:08.259 --> 10:11.088
It's a self portrait.

10:11.132 --> 10:14.091
You said to reveal something.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.180
Your spirit animal?

10:16.224 --> 10:18.356
I think it's actually a sparrow.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.620
But I've been feeling
pretty bunny lately.

10:24.754 --> 10:27.757
I should have told you
I was pregnant sooner.

10:27.801 --> 10:31.674
Just felt good to have someone
look at me for me.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.545
Is there a father?

10:33.589 --> 10:35.983
Not one who wants to be one.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.901
I'd been considering adoption,
but it's weird.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.903
All these couples make brochures

10:42.946 --> 10:44.513
advertising themselves but...

10:44.556 --> 10:47.211
You can't tell
who they really are.

10:51.476 --> 10:55.176
Liam, I get that
no one wants to hook up

10:55.219 --> 10:56.873
with a pregnant
high school girl.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.197
But I could really use a friend.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.615
You're in high school?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.965
You're less than
two years older.

11:02.009 --> 11:04.446
It's not your age.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.274
It's that you lied.

11:06.317 --> 11:07.754
About everything.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.799
Not about liking you.

11:14.238 --> 11:15.718
Maybe I'll see you around.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.073
How about in a couple hours?

11:25.510 --> 11:27.774
There's something I'd like
to show you.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.782
This is called a river.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.220
Got it.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.920
I thought we were email only.

11:43.964 --> 11:47.141
We're whatever I decide
we are at any given moment.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.317
Right now I'm deciding
to come in.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.930
If you decide to swear,
keep it down.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.410
There's a kid.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.761
- Enzo Napo...
- Maybe not with the last name.

11:58.805 --> 12:01.633
- Nice to meet you.
- Nicer to meet you.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.505
His last girlfriend
was mean as a snake.

12:03.548 --> 12:05.550
I'm not his girlfriend.

12:05.594 --> 12:07.944
Well, if you were,
I'd have a type.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.729
Let's go, kid. Vamoose.

12:10.904 --> 12:12.644
Alexa, play romantic music.

12:12.688 --> 12:14.472
Okay.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.344
Alexa, stop. He can't get enough

12:16.387 --> 12:17.693
- of that thing.
- Me, neither.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.608
Alexa, define privilege.
As a noun,

12:19.651 --> 12:22.002
privilege is usually defined...
Alexa, off.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.917
I'm not privileged.
See that couch?

12:23.960 --> 12:25.982
That's my bed because I gave
my grandfather my room.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.027
Which, by the way, doesn't have
a view of Central Park

12:28.051 --> 12:29.531
out the window.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.751
I'd show you my bank statement,
but it's a lot faster

12:31.794 --> 12:34.492
just to draw a zero.
Privilege isn't just money.

12:34.536 --> 12:37.017
- It's access.
- That's debatable.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.975
Let's hope not.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.674
Ava needs a favor.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.807
And it's from your father.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.385
Anybody home?

12:59.256 --> 13:01.432
Hello?

13:02.912 --> 13:04.392
Hello?

13:04.435 --> 13:07.830
This is a terrible hiding place.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.572
I don't know. I kind of like it.

13:10.615 --> 13:12.400
Door's locked, right?

13:14.097 --> 13:16.404
We're not home.

13:20.712 --> 13:23.150
Sarah?

13:23.193 --> 13:25.543
Hey. Grab a towel.

13:25.587 --> 13:27.371
There's a ton to do.

13:27.415 --> 13:29.983
Didn't realize mixing booze
was on your list of talents.

13:30.026 --> 13:32.246
I used to bartend
to make ends meet.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.814
We need to talk
about last night.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.251
Sarah...
Champagne flutes are dusty.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.166
Maybe you can start
with washing them?

13:39.209 --> 13:41.081
I know this is messy.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.261
Look at me.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.923
Stop. Stop.

13:56.966 --> 14:01.318
You have a girlfriend.
A beautiful girlfriend.

14:01.362 --> 14:03.451
Who loves you
and who lost a husband

14:03.494 --> 14:05.409
and who doesn't deserve
any more pain.

14:05.453 --> 14:07.281
Hurting Amy is
the last thing I want to do.

14:07.324 --> 14:10.719
Then go back to her. Be happy.

14:10.762 --> 14:13.417
What kind of man would I be
if I stayed with her

14:13.461 --> 14:14.897
and I just kept
thinking about you?

14:14.941 --> 14:17.552
It's an old crush.
Last night was inevitable.

14:17.595 --> 14:18.901
- No.
- Two stupid kids,

14:18.945 --> 14:20.468
haven't seen each other
in 17 years,

14:20.511 --> 14:22.078
getting something out
of their system.

14:22.122 --> 14:25.386
- You don't believe that.
- I brought you here for Katie.

14:25.429 --> 14:27.867
And you told me you weren't
quite ready for that.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.304
But you can handle
being with me?

14:30.347 --> 14:33.133
With all our baggage?

14:33.176 --> 14:35.091
What happens if we break up?

14:35.135 --> 14:36.876
Maybe we don't.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.616
Get right for my daughter, Nick.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.489
And forget me
like you did before.

14:41.532 --> 14:44.753
When did you give up?

14:44.796 --> 14:47.712
On having something
for yourself?

14:50.150 --> 14:54.328
Alone in a delivery room.
A long time ago.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.010
Whoo!

15:29.363 --> 15:32.453
I cannot believe
she's really here.

15:32.496 --> 15:35.325
Yes!

15:37.719 --> 15:41.114
A one-to-one ratio?
What is this, grade school?

15:41.157 --> 15:44.334
I'm not sure the gospel crowd
has your tolerance.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.858
Well, they should.
They preach it nonstop.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.819
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

15:52.777 --> 15:54.692
- What was that?
- What was what?

15:54.736 --> 15:56.346
You two.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.348
I'm an expert in human business.

16:06.487 --> 16:09.620
Do we know her?
I think I've seen her before.

16:09.664 --> 16:12.319
Not that I know of,
but that woman can sing.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.892
- Hello.
- Ava.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.416
Hey.

16:22.459 --> 16:23.895
Thank you.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.462
Good news.

16:25.506 --> 16:28.030
So, called a friend
down at the station.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.901
There's only one Gwendolina
in Brooklyn.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.077
Same age as yours.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.295
Did you get the address?

16:32.339 --> 16:34.254
Not if my supervisor asks.

16:36.778 --> 16:39.781
Holy cannoli. Fate delivers.

16:39.824 --> 16:42.044
You drive.
Wewe'll use the siren.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.829
It's my day off.
We're taking the bus.

16:47.397 --> 16:48.397
Good luck.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.238
Thank you.
We're gonna take a quick break.

17:02.282 --> 17:03.282
Stay put.

17:04.893 --> 17:07.026
Y'all are incredible!

17:07.069 --> 17:09.723
Breathing life into
this old place.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.987
This is Wendy.

17:14.555 --> 17:17.036
Wendy Parker?

17:17.079 --> 17:18.906
- I saw you perform.
- No!

17:18.950 --> 17:20.647
I used to bartend at the Alto.

17:20.691 --> 17:25.305
I think we even spoke.
Must have been 30 years ago.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.959
Well, what do you know.
My last living fan.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.920
Now, how about I trade you
a few stories about your bar

17:31.963 --> 17:33.313
for one of those mimosas?

17:33.356 --> 17:36.359
You got a deal. Follow me.

17:36.403 --> 17:39.145
- Patricia?
- I'm fine.

17:45.629 --> 17:48.110
- Sorry about the doorman.
- It's okay.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.112
I obviously look
super threatening.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.767
Yeah, it could be
anything under there.

17:54.812 --> 17:57.989
This is insane.

17:58.033 --> 17:59.817
Welcome to my survival job.

17:59.861 --> 18:02.037
Robbing rich people apartments?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.865
Terrace gardening.

18:03.908 --> 18:05.997
But I brought you here
for the art.

18:07.956 --> 18:10.480
- Who lives here?
- Nice couple.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.526
Husband owns that gallery
my show was at.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.180
Wife's an artist.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.965
Reminds me of you a little.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.619
In what way?

18:18.662 --> 18:21.796
Long ears, cotton tail.

18:24.015 --> 18:26.322
I have to work.
You should explore.

18:26.366 --> 18:27.758
What if they come home?

18:27.802 --> 18:30.979
It's fine.
I asked if I could bring you.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.633
They're cool.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.156
Thank you.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.940
That's what friends
are for, right?

18:49.954 --> 18:51.478
You can stop being nervous.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.480
You're not gonna get robbed
in this neighborhood.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.308
I'm surprised you stuck
to law when comedy

18:55.351 --> 18:57.875
is clearly your calling.
Game face, Gabe.

18:57.919 --> 19:00.182
This one ask could help keep
a woman and her child

19:00.226 --> 19:02.358
in this country.
I'm aware of the stakes.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.665
Well, your palpable
reluctance is nauseating.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.188
I'm not reluctant
to ask for help.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.668
I'd do anything for them.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.365
I just wish it didn't
involve my father.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.715
Please, you're the oldest
Italian son.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.848
The one who looks like
the wife he betrayed.

19:15.545 --> 19:18.505
He'd disappear for weeks.
I'd stay with my grandparents.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.856
Is that why you live with
your grandfather now?

19:21.899 --> 19:24.075
I live with my grandfather
because I love him,

19:24.119 --> 19:26.295
and he needs me.

19:27.862 --> 19:30.212
I'll let you know how it goes.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.612
You need to let last night go.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.266
Yeah, you made
that pretty clear.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.746
Amy's here.
I don't want a scene.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.490
That might be impossible.

19:47.534 --> 19:50.928
Guy she's with is a member
of my team.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.321
Is that bad?

19:52.365 --> 19:54.105
Well, if he finds out
I've been sleeping

19:54.149 --> 19:56.369
with my dead
teammate's wife, yeah.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.719
What are you gonna do?

19:59.981 --> 20:01.504
Prepare for friendly fire.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.365
My mother used to sing me that.

21:19.408 --> 21:21.845
- II am so sorry.
- Don't be.

21:21.889 --> 21:24.587
Liam told me you were up here.
I'm Claire.

21:24.631 --> 21:27.895
Katie.
And I'm wearing your coat.

21:27.938 --> 21:29.157
Not anymore.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.768
It was a giveaway pile,
so it's yours.

21:31.812 --> 21:34.641
II'm a fan
of everything you own.

21:34.684 --> 21:37.513
Well, I am a fan of your heart.

21:37.557 --> 21:40.342
The yarn bomb was really cool.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.388
If he had asked me first,
I would have told Liam

21:42.431 --> 21:45.086
not to set it on fire.
You and me both.

21:45.129 --> 21:46.217
Come on.

21:46.261 --> 21:47.369
I'll show you around
if you want.

21:47.393 --> 21:48.872
I definitely want.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.458
So you guys just,
run into each other?

22:09.502 --> 22:11.678
Yeah, Deacon called,
checking in.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.244
I told him I was headed over.

22:13.288 --> 22:15.421
Thought you could use
some family love.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.074
Yeah, I appreciate it, pal.

22:17.118 --> 22:19.947
Table just opened up.
I'll grab it.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.122
Do they let you sit?

22:21.165 --> 22:23.124
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.605
Ames, can I talk to you
for a second?

22:25.648 --> 22:27.258
Of course.

22:33.395 --> 22:34.918
Why would you bring him here?

22:34.962 --> 22:37.399
You said you were gonna
tell him before we moved in.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.096
I figured we could
do it together.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.446
What, between sets?

22:40.489 --> 22:42.578
Whenever you want.
However you want.

22:42.622 --> 22:45.581
II just figured it'd
be better if I was part

22:45.625 --> 22:47.409
of the conversation.
You figured wrong.

22:47.453 --> 22:48.778
If you don't wanna
look suspicious,

22:48.802 --> 22:50.499
holing up with me
in a stock room

22:50.543 --> 22:52.936
probably isn't a good idea.
And he just called you?

22:52.980 --> 22:54.895
Out of the blue?

22:54.938 --> 22:56.113
Yeah.

22:56.984 --> 23:00.117
Said he was worried
after group yesterday.

23:00.161 --> 23:02.816
You know, the one you told me
he wasn't at?

23:05.253 --> 23:08.691
Let me know when you wanna tell
me what the hell's going on.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.613
I never thought it would happen,

23:17.657 --> 23:19.310
starting over at my age.

23:19.354 --> 23:24.446
Well, you know what they say.
87 is the new 30.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.579
This is it. You ready?

23:26.622 --> 23:28.755
Try and stop me.

23:36.458 --> 23:40.680
- Yeah?
- Delivery for Gwendolina.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.029
Be right down.

23:42.072 --> 23:45.119
All right, let me see you.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.776
She won't stand a chance.

23:53.301 --> 23:54.650
I'm Gwendolina.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.435
Damn, Enzo.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.263
What have you done with my love?

23:59.307 --> 24:01.396
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.965
According to police records,
you're 80 years old.

24:06.096 --> 24:08.185
Well, I've got a badge,
if that helps.

24:09.099 --> 24:12.407
- She's dead.
- My God.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.278
I'm too late?

24:14.322 --> 24:18.065
- When?
- Like, four years ago.

24:21.155 --> 24:23.723
What sort of bum uses their
grandparent's identity

24:23.766 --> 24:24.898
to keep an apartment?

24:24.941 --> 24:27.814
Isn't that what Gabe was doing?

24:28.989 --> 24:31.208
You didn't even arrest her.

24:31.252 --> 24:33.341
Jails are full. Rent is high.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.038
Hey, but chin up.

24:35.082 --> 24:37.345
Your Gwendolina
is out there somewhere.

24:37.388 --> 24:41.001
I'm done. Screwed by fate.

24:41.044 --> 24:43.786
This is what I get
for stepping out on Rosemary.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.484
Aww. Come on.

24:48.399 --> 24:49.836
Is everything okay?

24:51.098 --> 24:52.708
Not really.

24:52.752 --> 24:55.624
I thought I could leave
the past in the past.

24:55.668 --> 24:57.626
Turns out it's not that easy.

24:59.062 --> 25:01.412
I screwed up.

25:01.456 --> 25:02.979
You and Nick.

25:04.764 --> 25:07.331
Drink and spill. I'm all ears.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.555
You know, once you shared a bed,

25:13.599 --> 25:16.819
it can be easy
to fall back into it.

25:16.863 --> 25:19.692
We weren't technically in a bed.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.998
It was a chair.

25:23.696 --> 25:25.654
Wow.

25:25.698 --> 25:28.527
Wow. Or not wow?

25:28.570 --> 25:30.920
Pretty wow.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.574
I am a terrible person.

25:32.618 --> 25:35.272
I'm sorry.

25:35.316 --> 25:38.362
It's just such a relief to hear
that we're in the same boat.

25:38.406 --> 25:40.016
I think cheating on a war widow

25:40.060 --> 25:43.803
with the disappeared secret
father of my pregnant teen

25:43.846 --> 25:45.761
is a boat of its own.

25:45.805 --> 25:48.547
You win.

25:52.420 --> 25:55.902
Most of what we collect
is modern, but that one

25:55.945 --> 25:58.687
we got in Florence
on our honeymoon.

25:58.731 --> 26:02.386
It was from a little gallery
right near the Ponte Vecchio.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.825
Every time I look at it,
I can feel the cobblestones.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.957
My mom's always wanted
to go to Italy.

26:08.001 --> 26:09.872
She should. It's beautiful.

26:11.352 --> 26:14.137
She's, umshe's got a lot
of responsibility.

26:14.181 --> 26:17.184
- Well, someday.
- Yeah.

26:18.620 --> 26:20.143
How old is your baby?

26:20.187 --> 26:22.232
That nursery is amazing.

26:23.103 --> 26:26.280
And a little premature.

26:26.323 --> 26:29.805
I had a late term loss.

26:29.849 --> 26:33.026
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

26:33.069 --> 26:35.898
It was a year ago,
so just haven't had it in me

26:35.942 --> 26:38.118
to take it all down.

26:38.161 --> 26:40.163
The garden is tended.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.078
I'm tempted to have
you start over.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.079
I like your friend.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.733
I thought you might.

26:44.777 --> 26:46.474
You ready?

26:46.517 --> 26:49.303
Yeah.
Um, thank you for the coat.

26:49.346 --> 26:51.348
And the tour. Andand the tea.

26:51.392 --> 26:54.090
Thank you for putting art
into the world.

26:54.134 --> 26:55.831
You keep it up, yeah?

26:55.875 --> 26:58.181
Yeah.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.444
See ya.

27:06.233 --> 27:08.167
I'm gonna spare you
my opinion of your taking on

27:08.191 --> 27:09.540
more responsibility, Gabriel.

27:09.584 --> 27:11.717
She lives in my building.
I couldn't say no.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.284
Your grandfather,
this charity case...

27:14.328 --> 27:16.132
You're gonna have to learn
the word at some point.

27:16.156 --> 27:17.853
These cases are so subjective.

27:17.897 --> 27:21.944
The judge who was just assigned
is a former colleague of yours.

27:21.988 --> 27:25.121
A letter from you on her behalf
could literally keep this woman

27:25.165 --> 27:26.949
with her son. One letter.

27:26.993 --> 27:30.126
Okay, here's the problem.

27:30.170 --> 27:31.780
I don't know her.

27:31.824 --> 27:34.522
To sign a letter saying I do,
it's no less than perjury

27:34.565 --> 27:36.369
than these letters that were
forged to keep her here

27:36.393 --> 27:38.439
in the first place.
I'm not asking for that.

27:38.482 --> 27:42.051
I'm asking for you to tell them
that your son vouches for her

27:42.095 --> 27:45.664
and that you believe
in your son.

27:47.361 --> 27:50.277
It's not perjury
if it's the truth.

27:51.757 --> 27:53.367
Who's the lawyer of record?

27:54.716 --> 27:56.762
I justl found her
a legal aid lawyer.

27:56.805 --> 27:58.372
Named?

28:00.853 --> 28:02.593
Sofia Lopez.

28:05.205 --> 28:08.121
The same Sofia Lopez
who's suing me?

28:10.471 --> 28:12.125
Maybe.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.265
Can I get you something?

28:22.309 --> 28:24.964
How about the truth?

28:25.007 --> 28:26.487
I'm sorry?

28:27.575 --> 28:30.143
I found this earring
on Nick's floor.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.058
Is it yours?

28:33.407 --> 28:36.932
Yeah. It must have fallen off.

28:36.976 --> 28:39.282
I guess you were
walking the dog.

28:41.371 --> 28:44.592
I'm actuallyl'm gonna need
an answer to that.

28:46.072 --> 28:49.075
Were you just walking the dog?

28:57.910 --> 29:00.216
How long?

29:00.260 --> 29:01.696
It was one time.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.785
I swear I'm telling
you the truth.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.744
It will not happen again.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.748
Are you in love with him?

29:11.619 --> 29:14.274
You just swore
to tell me the truth.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.722
She knows.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.815
Amy.

29:34.990 --> 29:36.644
Amy!

29:43.869 --> 29:44.957
Amy!

29:46.654 --> 29:48.482
I don't need your pity.

29:48.525 --> 29:50.963
I handled losing a husband.
Boyfriend's no big deal.

29:51.006 --> 29:52.965
We're more than that, Ame.

29:55.228 --> 29:56.795
We're family.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.407
We're not family.

30:01.016 --> 30:04.411
You're just the person
who got my husband killed.

30:15.596 --> 30:17.554
Is she okay?

30:19.339 --> 30:21.907
I've been sleeping with her.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.437
I'm sorry to hear that.

30:36.922 --> 30:39.359
I'm sorry her husband
wasn't there.

30:39.402 --> 30:40.839
Max is incredible.

30:40.882 --> 30:44.103
He runs this charity called
Art for Amity.

30:44.146 --> 30:46.366
What did you tell her?

30:46.409 --> 30:48.020
That you were cool.

30:48.063 --> 30:50.892
- And looking to offload a kid?
- No.

30:54.113 --> 30:56.245
Katie, I didn't tell her
you were pregnant.

30:56.289 --> 30:58.160
But that was the idea, right?

30:58.204 --> 31:01.903
Meet, chat about Florence,
hand over my unborn child.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.731
You said you couldn't see
adoptive parents

31:03.774 --> 31:05.037
for who they really were.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.908
I didn't ask you
to play matchmaker.

31:06.952 --> 31:07.996
She doesn't know.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.912
Because I happened
to put a coat on.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.045
I think you're upset
because you liked her.

31:16.178 --> 31:18.093
I have to go.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.095
Wait.

31:20.139 --> 31:21.401
Katie!

31:23.969 --> 31:26.319
I haven't shown you
what I painted last night.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.494
Gordon.

32:54.537 --> 32:56.800
It's good to see you, son.

32:56.844 --> 32:58.498
I didn't come here
to shake your hand.

32:58.541 --> 32:59.981
I came here to take
my daughter home.

33:01.892 --> 33:05.505
We understood that
she had your permission.

33:05.548 --> 33:06.854
You understood wrong.

33:06.897 --> 33:09.161
- Dad...
- Get upstairs.

33:11.424 --> 33:12.860
Olivia.

33:16.385 --> 33:18.039
She's 19 years old, Gordon.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.563
And she still lives
under my roof.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.523
You think she wants to meet you?

33:23.566 --> 33:26.178
Yeah, could have
done it any time.

33:26.221 --> 33:27.918
Girl's pissed off,
and it's the best way

33:27.962 --> 33:29.224
she can figure to punish me.

33:29.268 --> 33:33.054
You can't keep her
away from me forever.

33:33.098 --> 33:34.403
No?

33:34.447 --> 33:35.796
How about 27 years?

33:38.233 --> 33:40.801
That's how long I've had
to live without a mother

33:40.844 --> 33:42.629
because of you.

33:44.805 --> 33:46.546
You stay the hell away from her.

34:04.738 --> 34:05.913
Katie, hi.

34:05.956 --> 34:07.915
Can we talk some more?

34:07.958 --> 34:09.786
Yeah, sure. About what?

34:12.572 --> 34:13.964
This.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.362
CCome on in.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.549
Ron?

34:36.161 --> 34:39.467
You should not have gone to him.

34:39.512 --> 34:43.646
Baby, change is never easy.

34:43.690 --> 34:48.216
Now who's the one
comforting with platitudes?

34:48.260 --> 34:50.349
She wants to be in your life,

34:50.391 --> 34:53.047
and Gordon is just gonna have
to let her go.

34:53.091 --> 34:56.311
Just because you think
you're dying,

34:56.355 --> 34:59.836
it doesn't give you the right
to mess with my life.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.144
I didn't ask you to do this.

35:04.885 --> 35:07.148
He's my son.

35:07.192 --> 35:10.499
And it is too hard.

35:12.675 --> 35:14.112
Do you understand?

35:17.854 --> 35:19.465
Stop.

35:32.652 --> 35:33.653
Hello?

35:35.742 --> 35:37.874
Hello, can you hear me?

35:40.355 --> 35:42.270
This building's falling
to pieces.

35:55.762 --> 35:57.851
Gotta be kidding me.

36:15.434 --> 36:18.350
"Dear Enzo,
don't know how you were

36:18.393 --> 36:20.743
"supposed to try these without
getting my name.

36:20.787 --> 36:23.268
"Thank goodness for old phone
books and gentlemen

36:23.311 --> 36:25.226
"who introduce
themselves properly.

36:25.270 --> 36:27.924
Enjoy, Gwendolina Ferrari."

36:30.536 --> 36:34.409
I got the digits.
I got the digits.

36:34.453 --> 36:35.628
Yes!

36:50.773 --> 36:53.472
You filed suit
against my dad's firm?

36:54.473 --> 36:56.605
After he blew me off with
interns who knew nothing

36:56.649 --> 36:58.564
about my complaint, yeah.

36:58.607 --> 37:00.653
I represent the interests
of my clients.

37:00.696 --> 37:01.697
Ava's your client.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.438
Her interest was
getting that letter.

37:03.482 --> 37:05.527
Instead I got an ultimatum.

37:05.571 --> 37:09.009
Me or the internship?
That's typical.

37:09.052 --> 37:10.576
How fast did you answer?

37:10.619 --> 37:11.925
I haven't.

37:15.363 --> 37:18.540
Look, Ava's case is a long shot.

37:18.584 --> 37:20.673
It'll be over in a month.

37:20.716 --> 37:22.718
And she's got me.

37:22.762 --> 37:25.895
So, keep the internship.

37:47.047 --> 37:48.483
Come on, buddy.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.391
- Mom?
- Yeah?

38:26.434 --> 38:28.349
Making dinner.

38:31.570 --> 38:32.832
Katie?

38:32.875 --> 38:34.181
What is it?

38:34.224 --> 38:37.576
I think I met a woman
I can give my baby to.

38:39.621 --> 38:42.885
She's nice and she has money
and she loves art

38:42.929 --> 38:45.540
and she really wants a baby
because she lost hers.

38:45.584 --> 38:48.151
Hey, hey. It's okay.

38:49.631 --> 38:52.025
Then why do I feel bad?

38:54.419 --> 38:56.464
Because being a mom is hard.

39:21.184 --> 39:22.925
Do your worst, pal.

39:32.457 --> 39:33.457
Nick.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.530
- Get Ben.
- Don't!

40:02.574 --> 40:03.792
Don't. I asked for it.

40:03.836 --> 40:05.359
Grab some ice.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.362
Katie!

40:08.406 --> 40:09.885
You were a firefighter?

40:11.887 --> 40:14.107
A long time ago for a minute.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.894
Yes or no?

40:23.246 --> 40:26.119
You said my dad
was a firefighter on 9/11.

40:26.162 --> 40:27.947
Yes or no?

40:31.341 --> 40:33.431
Yes or no, Mom?

40:35.215 --> 40:37.522
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

40:38.479 --> 40:39.741
Yes.

40:49.185 --> 40:51.492
Katie. Katie!

40:55.888 --> 40:59.065
Katie. Katie, please!

40:59.108 --> 41:01.110
Katie, please!

41:02.590 --> 41:03.741
Katie, please, please, please.

41:03.765 --> 41:05.071
- Let me ex...
- Don't touch me!

41:05.114 --> 41:06.376
I get that you're angry.

41:06.420 --> 41:08.509
You said my dad was a mistake.

41:08.553 --> 41:10.511
I know. I know I did.

41:10.555 --> 41:12.382
You knew where he was
this whole time?

41:12.426 --> 41:14.080
17 years?
Just come upstairs with me.

41:14.123 --> 41:16.604
I'll tell you everything.
Why did you do this?

41:16.648 --> 41:18.258
Please, please, please, please.

41:18.301 --> 41:20.086
II never meant to hurt you.

41:20.129 --> 41:21.435
Get out of my way.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.698
- No, no, no.
- Get out of my...

41:23.742 --> 41:25.265
Please, Katie. Please don't go.

41:25.308 --> 41:26.701
Please, I love you so much.

41:26.745 --> 41:28.442
Let me go or I swear to God

41:28.486 --> 41:30.313
I will never speak to you again!
