WEBVTT

00:07.925 --> 00:09.510
Oh, thank God, you're here.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.762
Please, I wouldn't make you
face Mrs. Moyers alone.

00:11.762 --> 00:14.765
She's so blonde and smiley
and dark-sided.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.392
The woman needs to
be double-teamed.

00:16.392 --> 00:17.977
Remember that time she
threatened detention

00:17.977 --> 00:19.395
and we couldn't tell
if it was for us or Ethan?

00:19.395 --> 00:20.771
It was for us.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.273
Oh, and did I tell you
about the cupcake incident?

00:22.273 --> 00:23.399
No, spill.

00:23.399 --> 00:25.609
A couple months ago,
I had the audacity

00:25.609 --> 00:27.778
to bring pink-frosted
cupcakes to the bake sale

00:27.778 --> 00:29.363
when Totie Nussbaum
had already staked that turf.

00:33.993 --> 00:36.036
The fabric cutters
are upstairs.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.539
One of them's been here longer
than Pop's owned the place.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.291
And these are our seamstresses.

00:40.291 --> 00:43.544
Hello, ladies.
Oh, this fabric. I want.

00:43.544 --> 00:47.339
It's from Istanbul. Pop's got
suppliers all over the world.

00:47.339 --> 00:49.383
This is Letty, our senior
button sewer.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.926
Letty, this is my
girlfriend Midge.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.011
Hello, Letty.

00:52.011 --> 00:53.763
What happened to Talia?

00:53.763 --> 00:55.514
Happy sewing, ladies.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.224
What did happen to Talia, Joel?

00:57.224 --> 00:59.518
Talia got the boot the moment
you agreed to go out with me.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.604
Talia didn't stand a chance.

01:01.604 --> 01:04.940
- Joely!
- There they are. Ma, Pop.

01:04.940 --> 01:07.067
I want to introduce you
to Miriam Weissman.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.486
Moishe Maisel. A real pleasure.

01:08.486 --> 01:09.612
The pleasure is mine.

01:09.612 --> 01:11.071
This is Joel's mother Shirley.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.156
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Maisel.

01:12.156 --> 01:14.158
My God, the grandchildren
I'm going to have.

01:14.158 --> 01:15.743
- Ma, you're crushing her.
- Now, they're just dating.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.328
How you doing for tap pants?

01:17.328 --> 01:18.370
I think I'm tapped out.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.790
- We just got some in. Come see.
- Oh.

01:20.790 --> 01:23.834
I'll need her back
at some point, Ma.

01:23.834 --> 01:27.463
- Well?
- This, my son, is a girl
you do not let go of.

01:27.463 --> 01:29.381
This, Pop... is forever.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.050
What size are you?
You're tiny.

01:31.050 --> 01:32.802
She kept saying it.

01:32.802 --> 01:34.845
"Nut bars. You signed up
to make nut bars.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.055
Where are the nut bars?"

01:36.055 --> 01:38.307
In the meantime, all my cupcakes
sold like hotcakes

01:38.307 --> 01:41.602
and Totie Nussbaum's entire
tray got the go-by. Ha!

01:41.602 --> 01:42.978
Is that her?

01:42.978 --> 01:45.689
Sit up.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.149
False alarm.

01:47.149 --> 01:50.027
Let me tell you, the dads here
are as bad as the moms.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.737
They tried to get me
to coach a team.

01:51.737 --> 01:52.988
How'd you get out of it?

01:52.988 --> 01:55.324
- Faked a war injury.
- You didn't.

01:55.324 --> 01:56.659
These guys know nothing
of my background,

01:56.659 --> 01:58.202
so I took advantage of that.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.162
No one is going to
question a war hero.

02:02.331 --> 02:03.749
<i>I gave you
the sign to leave.</i>

02:03.749 --> 02:04.792
Over an hour ago.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.794
It's only 9:30, Grandpa.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.379
Well, one of us works.

02:08.379 --> 02:11.173
I'm sorry, I was entertaining
your old street hockey friends

02:11.173 --> 02:12.424
because I thought
that's what you wanted.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.510
Well, you thought wrong.

02:14.510 --> 02:15.928
- Pull over.
- What?

02:15.928 --> 02:16.887
- Here?
- No.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.431
- Stop the car.
- Midge!

02:19.431 --> 02:22.560
So dramatic, I'm married
to Barbara Stanwyck here.

02:24.103 --> 02:25.521
It's a buck-forty, pal!

02:25.521 --> 02:26.856
Just hold on.

02:26.856 --> 02:28.315
Midge, what are you doing?

02:28.315 --> 02:30.025
Walking home.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.111
We're in Brooklyn.
You'll be home around dawn.

02:32.111 --> 02:34.196
No problem, I don't
have work tomorrow.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.990
Wait, did I pronounce
that right? "Work"?

02:35.990 --> 02:37.992
I've only read the word
in my magazines.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.159
You're not even going
the right direction.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.369
The bridge is that way.

02:40.369 --> 02:41.662
The bridge is this way.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.830
I grew up here, Midge.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.248
I can see the lights.

02:44.248 --> 02:46.417
Are you and Barbara getting
back in the car or what?

02:46.417 --> 02:47.668
Just follow us.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.461
With the meter running?
Are you crazy?

02:49.461 --> 02:51.297
There may not be another
cab when we're done.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.716
Well, how long do you think
this fight is gonna last?

02:53.716 --> 02:55.009
Hopefully not too long.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.677
I've only got three bucks
in my wallet.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.096
Well, if you are walking,
miss, then keep going.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.514
The bridge is that way.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.642
No, it's not.
Yes, it is, goddamn it.

03:03.642 --> 03:06.061
I don't know my own neighborhood.

03:06.061 --> 03:09.023
The bridge may have been down
there when you were a kid.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.566
Things change.

03:10.566 --> 03:13.277
And my friends,
they are horrible.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.737
All that burping and slurping.

03:14.737 --> 03:17.323
Tony blew his nose
into a cocktail napkin

03:17.323 --> 03:18.824
and kept using it.

03:18.824 --> 03:21.410
I won't inflict them
on you again. I promise.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.205
But they're your friends.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.750
I just need you. That's all.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.835
Took you a while
to figure that out.

03:31.253 --> 03:35.174
Hey. Our song.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.508
Come here, Barbara.

03:36.508 --> 03:42.056
<i>♪ See the pyramids
along the Nile ♪</i>

03:42.056 --> 03:44.808
<i>♪ Watch the sun rise ♪</i>

03:44.808 --> 03:46.977
<i>♪ From a tropic isle...</i>

03:46.977 --> 03:50.230
This dance is going to put
another 80 cents on the meter.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.066
Let's make it an even buck.

03:52.066 --> 03:55.611
<i>♪ All the while ♪</i>

03:55.611 --> 03:57.905
<i>♪ You belong to me ♪</i>

03:57.905 --> 03:59.156
<i>Only problem is,</i>

03:59.156 --> 04:00.866
the dads also have
a veteran's group,

04:00.866 --> 04:02.701
and now I have to go
to those meetings.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.702
Still better than coaching.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.245
Good morning.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.497
I'm sorry, did I scare you?

04:06.497 --> 04:07.748
Always.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.042
- I sometimes do that.
- Hello, Mrs. Moyers.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.086
Yes, hello, Mrs. Moyers.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.922
Thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.216
So, why are we here today?

04:18.467 --> 04:20.177
- It was rhetorical.
- Got it.

04:20.177 --> 04:23.555
We have a problem.
He's been rude. Disrespectful.

04:23.555 --> 04:26.058
Incredibly disruptive.
Throwing tantrums.

04:26.058 --> 04:27.059
Oh, boy...

04:27.059 --> 04:28.727
And then there's
the pipe smoking.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.771
- Ethan's smoking a pipe?
- Not Ethan.

04:30.771 --> 04:31.897
Your father.

04:31.897 --> 04:34.692
- Abe?
- He's been back several times

04:34.692 --> 04:36.860
since the incident
with the aptitude test.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.321
Talking about your daughter's
future enrollment here.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.949
Whether the curriculum's
up to her standards.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.993
Wanting to interview teachers,
vet textbooks...

04:43.993 --> 04:46.704
I'm sorry, this is not funny.

04:46.704 --> 04:48.872
No, I'm sorry.
This is quite funny.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.458
Yeah, you know science
and stuff. We know funny.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.044
This is funny.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.380
We would like him not to return
for the foreseeable future.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.173
Not till he adjusts
his attitude.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.676
We've never banned
a grandparent before.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.678
Even the Happy Group
seems dismayed...

05:09.184 --> 05:12.104
Penny. I didn't know
you were still here.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.232
Just trying to figure out
this new-fangled thing.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.608
So, you have a 10:00

05:16.608 --> 05:18.235
with the production team
tomorrow morning,

05:18.235 --> 05:19.570
and lunch with Nadler at 1:00.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.030
That you'll cancel
first thing tomorrow.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.990
- I always do.
- What would I do without you?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.241
I would hate to think.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.618
- Good night.
- Good night.

05:32.082 --> 05:35.002
Hey. You feel like
getting a drink?

05:35.002 --> 05:36.628
Sure.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.173
<i>Obviously,
we would like my father</i>

05:39.173 --> 05:41.675
to be able to see
our son graduate.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.094
When he appears in school plays.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.597
As long as we keep him
on a tight leash?

05:46.597 --> 05:47.723
A leash would help.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.433
I don't mean a physical leash.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.602
Well, I hear you
and I will take this up

05:51.602 --> 05:53.187
with the faculty, I promise.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.605
That's all we ask. Thank you.

05:54.605 --> 05:55.814
Yes, thank you.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.441
Thank you.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.528
Can we go...?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.947
You may go.

06:06.492 --> 06:08.160
So what's your day today?

06:08.160 --> 06:11.121
Today, I am hopping
a train to Bryn Mawr.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.956
You're kidding. For what?

06:12.956 --> 06:15.584
It's a luncheon for the ladies
of the Class of '53.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.628
Oh, so it'll be
Petra, Daniella...

06:17.628 --> 06:19.213
Tammy, Kiki, all the girls.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.214
Who hate me.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.465
They don't hate you.

06:21.465 --> 06:22.549
- Detest me?
- Eh.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.801
- Despise me?
- Eh.

06:23.801 --> 06:25.135
Pick the word. "Abhor" is good.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.096
I will defend you. To a point.

06:27.096 --> 06:28.931
I will take "to a point."

06:28.931 --> 06:31.600
Have fun. And send them
all my love,

06:31.600 --> 06:32.893
if only to confuse them.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.436
I will.

06:34.436 --> 06:37.189
Mrs. Maisel, will I see you at
the next library fundraiser?

06:37.189 --> 06:38.774
I'm gonna try, Barbara.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.317
You missed last year.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.318
I know, I'm sorry.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.987
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.031
Can we get a drink sometime?

06:46.031 --> 06:49.118
Catch up? Talk about something
other than the kids?

06:49.118 --> 06:52.454
Sure. I would like that.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.665
Me, too. I'll call you.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.309
Fascinating. Hmm.

07:14.309 --> 07:17.312
Utterly fascinating.

07:19.064 --> 07:23.235
Woo-hoo. Especially this page.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.781
Well... time for a snack.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.636
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.597
I'm watching Esther.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.182
Watching her play?

07:53.182 --> 07:54.808
Watching to see what she'll do.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.811
Clearly, she has some
kind of freak talent.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.354
In music, at least.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.858
And now I want to ascertain
the breadth of her abilities.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.611
For instance, does it
extend to literature?

08:05.611 --> 08:07.696
So, I left my book there

08:07.696 --> 08:10.616
and I want to see
if she goes over to my book.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.618
Okay...

08:12.618 --> 08:14.369
Is there candy in the book?

08:14.369 --> 08:16.705
No, there's no candy
in the book.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.624
Why would there be candy
in the book?

08:18.624 --> 08:20.709
Well, if you're waiting for her
to go over to that book,

08:20.709 --> 08:22.461
I assumed you put
some candy in the book.

08:22.461 --> 08:23.921
Hard candy,
that's what she likes.

08:23.921 --> 08:26.757
I don't want to
feed her hard candy, Rose,

08:26.757 --> 08:30.219
I want to see if she'll
go over to the book

08:30.219 --> 08:32.679
and not because she thinks
there's candy.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.348
What's the book?

08:34.348 --> 08:38.143
It's <i>Being and Nothingness</i>
by Sartre.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.519
Are there pictures?

08:39.519 --> 08:43.232
In <i>Being and Nothingness?</i>
No, there's no pictures.

08:43.232 --> 08:45.234
Then you should probably
put some candy in the book.

08:45.234 --> 08:47.361
Even one piece could
make a difference.

08:47.361 --> 08:50.572
Rose, I just want
to see if she's curious

08:50.572 --> 08:53.450
about the text in the book.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.494
I have to see
if my granddaughter

08:55.494 --> 08:58.413
is the grandson
I've been waiting for.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.540
She's not going to know what
<i>Being and Nothingness</i> is,

09:00.540 --> 09:02.292
even if she's curious
about the text.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.503
No one knows what
<i>Being and Nothingness</i> is,

09:04.503 --> 09:06.755
Sartre doesn't even know.

09:06.755 --> 09:09.174
Even I'm just pretending
to read it.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.425
Pretending?

09:10.425 --> 09:11.885
For the experiment.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.054
But if she suspects that you're
pretending to read it,

09:14.054 --> 09:15.806
she may think this
is some sort of trick

09:15.806 --> 09:17.849
and will purposely
ignore the book.

09:17.849 --> 09:21.353
Which would indicate an aptitude

09:21.353 --> 09:24.523
for cognitive reasoning
far beyond her age.

09:24.523 --> 09:26.483
So going to the book

09:26.483 --> 09:29.695
would indicate advanced
mental faculties

09:29.695 --> 09:32.197
and not going to the book

09:32.197 --> 09:35.826
would also indicate
advanced mental faculties.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.289
I'd still go with candy.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.293
Oh, dumb doll.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.336
Mm-hmm. I know what
you're saying, James,

09:46.336 --> 09:47.504
I know what it must
have sounded like,

09:47.504 --> 09:50.090
but I think it was just
a miscommunication.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.634
She may have been high,
yeah, smoking tea, sure,

09:52.634 --> 09:54.219
we all need to unwind at times.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.638
No, because she wants
to apologize in person.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.849
She's coming out there now,
she's coming to Baltimore.

09:58.849 --> 10:00.225
Yeah, she wants
to see you on the set

10:00.225 --> 10:02.060
and take you for soft shell
crabs at Haussner's.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.603
I'm booking
the train ticket now.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.773
Okay, well, enjoy the fruit
basket with the wine pairing,

10:06.773 --> 10:08.275
the robe, the tennis racket
and the bicycle.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.777
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.321
I'm allergic to crabs.

10:12.321 --> 10:13.864
"It's not your turn"?
Did you really say that?

10:13.864 --> 10:15.240
Yes.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.492
- Want to give me some context?
- Not now, Dinah.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.161
Then when?
After James fires you?

10:19.161 --> 10:20.662
Is he gonna fire me?

10:20.662 --> 10:22.581
He's on the brink. I turned
it around with those gifts.

10:22.581 --> 10:25.000
You should've checked
with me about those gifts.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.585
Those gifts saved
your ass, Susie,

10:26.585 --> 10:27.794
pardon my French.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.588
Now pack a bag,
you're going to Baltimore.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.131
Look, I know you mean well,

10:31.131 --> 10:33.091
but you are missing
the complexities here.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.218
I understand the goddamn complexities.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.763
You're gonna let James walk away
'cause you can't break Midge.

10:37.763 --> 10:39.806
Fuck you, I'm gonna break Midge.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.975
It's not one or the other.
Midge is my girl, too.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.935
But Midge isn't getting it
handed to her like James.

10:43.935 --> 10:46.521
Really? You want to try
being Black for a day?

10:47.731 --> 10:50.025
No one's handed James anything,
he's earned what he has.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.234
I know.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.611
So don't let him walk away.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.571
Because if you do,
then I may walk away.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.323
And you really can't
live without me.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.075
How much was the bike?

10:59.368 --> 11:00.285
Book the ticket.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.037
While you book James on Paar.

11:10.921 --> 11:12.172
Hello, ladies!

11:15.050 --> 11:16.843
God, Midge, what
are you wearing?

11:16.843 --> 11:18.512
- I love it.
- Oh, this old thing?

11:18.512 --> 11:20.305
Old? It's straight out
of this month's <i>Vogue.</i>

11:20.305 --> 11:22.099
What about you? Fashion model.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.517
She did model.

11:23.517 --> 11:24.935
Get a load!
I brought an old friend!

11:24.935 --> 11:26.436
- Oh, my God.
- The flask.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.688
My daddy's, remember?
From his days in the cavalry.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.857
Right, and when
a party got boring, we'd...

11:30.857 --> 11:32.567
Call for the cavalry!

11:34.319 --> 11:36.446
Let's get moving, ladies,
we can't miss the auction.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.906
Or lunch, I'm famished.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.117
You got a new one, Kiki.
Don't be selfish.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.868
- Let me see a picture.
- Oh, I don't carry pictures.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.161
What?

11:43.161 --> 11:44.704
Here they are, the whole gang.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.790
- Four? You have four here?
- Everything's butter.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.792
- How is Tom?
- Buttery. Very buttery.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.961
What's buttery? Tom?

11:50.961 --> 11:54.506
What's with the teeny, tiny
petite-y, patootie sandwiches?

11:54.506 --> 11:57.384
They want us to stay teeny-tiny
petite-y patootie ladies.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.885
That ship's sailed.

11:58.885 --> 11:59.928
This is just sprouts between

11:59.928 --> 12:01.263
two tiny slices of bread.
And no crust.

12:01.263 --> 12:04.266
Another cucumber.
Every other one is cucumber.

12:04.266 --> 12:05.934
This is a half strawberry
on top of cream cheese.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.186
- Cream cheese? I'll take that.
- Be my guest.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.982
Ugh, it's not cream cheese.
It's like a whipped salmon.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.608
Why would anyone want
to whip salmon?

12:13.608 --> 12:15.360
- Napkin.
- All ready for you.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.280
Why the fuck can't they just
give us turkey and ham on rye?

12:18.280 --> 12:20.407
- Petra...
- I need something to soak up

12:20.407 --> 12:22.617
this booze. I mean,
the lawn is spinning.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.619
Not me. Cavalry! Pass it!

12:24.619 --> 12:27.456
Tammy, what is this
you bid on? Weapons?

12:27.456 --> 12:29.458
Lawn darts.
My boys will love them.

12:29.458 --> 12:30.792
They look dangerous.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.210
They wouldn't sell them
if they were dangerous.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.546
I'm very happy with my owl.
I'm naming him Charlie.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.465
I'd swear its eyes
are following me.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.091
Midge did the best of all of us.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.052
You got to bid fast and furious
to score a Hoover Lark.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.095
What a beaut.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.181
It's the lightest vacuum
on the market.

12:44.181 --> 12:46.766
It's not even on the market yet.
I'm green with envy.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.268
Oh, there's Mr. Dee,
from Sociology?

12:48.268 --> 12:51.396
Connie, hello, long time no see.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.231
How did he get more handsome?

12:53.231 --> 12:54.441
That's not fair.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.151
What was his full name?
It's not just Dee.

12:56.151 --> 12:57.944
I always thought it was
short for Dee-licious.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.779
I almost didn't recognize
him with the...

12:59.779 --> 13:03.200
He just kissed Sandra
Gutenberg smack on the lips.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.409
He sure did.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.328
Doesn't he know where
that mouth has been?

13:06.328 --> 13:08.079
I sure hope so. They're married.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.706
- Married?
- Eight years now.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.541
Which makes her Sandra Dee?
Really?

13:11.541 --> 13:15.003
She swears they weren't a
couple when she was a student.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.796
- Oh, please.
- Said they ran into each other
at a Piggly Wiggly

13:16.796 --> 13:19.174
right after graduation
and sparks flew.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.718
Yeah, well, rumor has it,
she was wiggling his piggly

13:21.718 --> 13:23.470
every afternoon
behind Dalton Hall.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.932
Hi, Sandra.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.017
- Hi, ladies.
- Nice to see you.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.894
So, Midge...

13:30.894 --> 13:32.395
So, Daniella...

13:32.395 --> 13:33.522
Elephant in the room?

13:33.522 --> 13:34.648
I told you not to bring it up.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.733
It's okay.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.027
Yes, I'm converting
to Christianity.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.654
- What? No.
- Are you?

13:40.654 --> 13:42.072
Midge...

13:42.072 --> 13:45.659
Things are fine with Joel.
We're friends.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.369
Palmer Witherspoon is
still brokenhearted.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.454
And available.
He and Tuffy just divorced.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.790
Palmer Witherspoon had the
personality of a shoehorn.

13:51.790 --> 13:53.458
He's a lead accountant
at Deloitte now.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.584
As I was saying...

13:54.584 --> 13:56.253
You and Joel moved so fast.

13:56.253 --> 13:58.838
Palmer was gone one day
and bam, you two were a thing.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.007
Or were you two a thing,
then bam, Palmer was gone?

14:01.007 --> 14:04.469
He was very persistent.
But I controlled the pace,

14:04.469 --> 14:06.680
because I was a proper,
chaste young lady...

14:06.680 --> 14:07.889
Until we were married.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.307
Until you were engaged.

14:09.307 --> 14:10.725
Yeah, who you fooling?

14:10.725 --> 14:12.519
We saw you two up
against that tree.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.812
Kiki!

14:13.812 --> 14:14.896
You almost uprooted the thing.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.940
Definitely rubbed some bark off.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.776
I knew those binoculars weren't
just for bird-watching.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.571
I did warn you about him,
you remember that, right?

14:22.571 --> 14:25.115
Yes, Petra.
You were very protective.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.992
And now you're a single
working girl.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.326
Working for Gordon Ford.

14:28.326 --> 14:29.744
Is it so much fun?

14:29.744 --> 14:30.996
Do you laugh all day?

14:30.996 --> 14:33.290
It's a bit of a grind.
But there are laughs.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.875
And you perform. Onstage.
I can't picture that.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.920
You can't? She gave the toast
at her wedding. Stole the show.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.755
I meant I can't picture me
doing that.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.592
You're not scared standing
onstage in front of people?

14:43.592 --> 14:45.927
Well, let's see...

14:45.927 --> 14:48.013
If there was anything else
in the entire world

14:48.013 --> 14:50.640
that I could possibly do to earn
a living, I would. Anything.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.726
I'm talking dry cleaners
to the Klan,

14:52.726 --> 14:55.312
crippled-kid portrait painter,
slaughterhouse attendant...

14:55.312 --> 14:57.564
I don't think those
are the only options.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.524
Just something a friend
told me once.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.901
No. Not scared onstage.

15:01.901 --> 15:05.322
Offstage, though, in the club
bathrooms, that's terrifying.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.574
Why do you do it?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.659
Because I love it.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.495
People listen to you.
Plus, you get free drinks.

15:12.495 --> 15:16.333
You said on the phone that you
were going to be on Jack Paar.

15:16.333 --> 15:19.544
That was just an audition
to be on his show.

15:19.544 --> 15:22.339
They haven't made
a decision yet. We'll see.

15:22.339 --> 15:23.465
Oh, there's Corky Fleming.

15:23.465 --> 15:24.841
Always hated her. Hi, Corky!

15:24.841 --> 15:26.718
- Hi, Corky.
- Hi, girls.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.678
Corky used to fool
around with Mr. Dee, too.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.555
This all happen during
my semester in Prague?

15:30.555 --> 15:32.098
Everyone had
a thing for Mr. Dee.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.600
Not me. He gave me a C.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.019
Calvary, please!

15:37.729 --> 15:39.648
Is this allowed?
We don't have passes.

15:39.648 --> 15:41.358
We don't need
no stinking passes!

15:41.358 --> 15:42.859
We're esteemed alumnae.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.904
Come on, ladies.
Fortune favors the brave!

15:45.904 --> 15:47.280
Do you dream about the dorms?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.865
I still have dreams
about the dorms.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.664
Do I smell food?

15:55.664 --> 15:57.082
Are they allowing
hot plates now?

15:57.082 --> 15:58.166
Don't approve.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.876
They have a TV in their room!

15:59.876 --> 16:01.169
So spoiled.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.755
Aw.

16:03.755 --> 16:07.842
Hi. Sounds good,
the rock and roll.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.177
Yup.

16:09.177 --> 16:11.846
Petra and I played
"Toolie Oolie Doolie" nonstop

16:11.846 --> 16:13.765
for two months
in this very room.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.141
<i>♪ The things we've done...</i>

16:15.141 --> 16:16.351
The Andrews Sisters?

16:16.351 --> 16:19.312
Right. My mother has
one of their records.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.439
What's she up to tonight?

16:21.439 --> 16:23.024
You looking for your kid?

16:23.024 --> 16:24.442
- My kid?
- We're 30, peewee.
- Come on.

16:24.442 --> 16:25.443
Geez.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.237
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.239
This is okay with you?

16:29.239 --> 16:30.532
What?

16:30.532 --> 16:33.410
What. She says "What?"

16:33.410 --> 16:35.078
What?

16:37.372 --> 16:38.373
What did we miss?

16:38.373 --> 16:40.333
This carpet was unforgivable.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.044
- Not anymore. The Lark's really
suctioning up the dirt.
- Feet.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.754
The Lark is the lightest-weight
vacuum on the market.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.798
And easy to store.

16:46.798 --> 16:50.260
Something to keep
in mind, Sherry. Barb.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.511
- Sure.
- Okay.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.013
Three of us slept
in here? Really?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.849
How did we ever fit
all our stuff?

16:55.849 --> 16:57.559
Why is the world getting
so much smaller?

16:57.559 --> 17:00.311
Hey, come on. We want to see
if they're still there.

17:00.311 --> 17:02.021
- If what's still where?
- Come on!

17:03.022 --> 17:04.023
Bye.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.024
Bye, girls.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.109
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.612
Cleanliness is
next to godliness.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.699
Holy shit, what am I, 80?

17:17.328 --> 17:18.455
Ew, spiderwebs!

17:18.455 --> 17:19.873
You wanted to go first.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.292
- Smells like Tut's tomb
in here.
- Oh...

17:22.292 --> 17:24.335
Somebody get a stick
and wave it in front of us.

17:24.335 --> 17:25.545
Take the cobwebs down.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.005
Keep moving, Kiki.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.757
Oh, that stick's
not long enough.

17:28.757 --> 17:30.091
Midge, use your vacuum.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.426
The Lark is not a toy.

17:31.426 --> 17:34.429
Oy, girls. Come on,
time's a-wasting.

17:34.429 --> 17:35.597
- Oh! Aah!
- Aah!

17:35.597 --> 17:38.391
I hate spiders
more than anything.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.435
This is smaller, too.

17:40.435 --> 17:41.853
Everything's shrinking.

17:41.853 --> 17:44.147
Our cigarette butts
are still on the ground.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.065
Good. That means they
still might be here.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.109
And they are.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.153
Oh, we attached
ribbons and flowers.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.362
We were so cute.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.489
Whose color was this?
Anyone remember?

17:52.489 --> 17:53.490
Was I yellow?

17:53.490 --> 17:54.783
No, I was yellow,
you were purple.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.493
The blue and purple
are looking a lot alike.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.786
Hold them up to the light.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.871
I was definitely green.
Gimme, gimme.

17:59.871 --> 18:00.872
- Blue.
- Oh.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.582
- Pink.
- Ah.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.959
Whose idea was it to write
notes to our future selves?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.503
- Yours.
- No.

18:06.503 --> 18:08.630
It was definitely yours, Midge.
You always thought ahead.

18:08.630 --> 18:09.756
Our fearless leader.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.299
All right, gang, here's mine.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.425
Read, read.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.135
"Love as if your
life depends on it."

18:14.135 --> 18:15.470
Really?

18:15.470 --> 18:17.597
You went through that whole
Kahlil Gibran phase.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.224
I gave that book away
with my jump ropes.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.142
- And do you?
- Do I what?

18:21.142 --> 18:23.144
Love as if your life
depends on it?

18:23.144 --> 18:27.190
I'll say yes. Not always,
I should try harder, but yes.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.274
Good.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.401
- I'm next. Little Miss Blue.
- Mm.

18:30.401 --> 18:32.403
"Be thoughtful. Be thin."

18:32.403 --> 18:34.030
Oh, young Petra, you bitch.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.740
Keep reading.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.659
"Cherish your parents,
cherish your children,

18:37.659 --> 18:40.203
cherish your friends,
and please be happy." Aw.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.329
- That's sweet.
- Yeah.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.873
Sorry, young me.
You weren't a bitch.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.083
Here's me.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.837
"Read <i>Don Quixote</i>
in the original Spanish"?

18:48.837 --> 18:50.380
Oh, God, I never
even learned Spanish.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.006
What else?

18:52.006 --> 18:53.341
Just a long, obnoxious list

18:53.341 --> 18:55.760
of other books to read
in various languages.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.389
And I end with "Most Sincerely,
Your Younger You."

18:59.389 --> 19:00.598
- Mm.
- Kiki?

19:00.598 --> 19:02.392
Okay. "Work
for seven years,

19:02.392 --> 19:03.977
save money, travel
for six months,

19:03.977 --> 19:06.062
then get married
and have some kids."

19:06.062 --> 19:07.605
Okay, I did not do that.

19:07.605 --> 19:08.982
- You had some kids.
- And then some.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.942
And that's where the story ends.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.026
Midge?

19:12.026 --> 19:14.612
All right, here I go.

19:14.612 --> 19:17.240
What's it say?

19:17.240 --> 19:18.324
"Don't."

19:18.324 --> 19:19.534
- Don't?
- Don't what?

19:19.534 --> 19:21.786
That's it. Just "Don't."

19:21.786 --> 19:23.288
Did you not finish the sentence?

19:23.288 --> 19:25.331
No, I added an exclamation
point and underlined it twice.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.835
Let me see that. "Don't." Weird.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.044
What did you mean?

19:30.044 --> 19:31.880
- No clue.
- Do you remember writing this?

19:31.880 --> 19:33.590
- Nope.
- Maybe it was
"Don't hurt anyone."

19:33.590 --> 19:34.591
Something like that.

19:34.591 --> 19:35.800
Then why didn't I write that?

19:35.800 --> 19:37.176
I know what
it was, Midge.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.720
You were going to wear
that purple dress

19:38.720 --> 19:40.847
to the senior formal but
you knew deep down not to.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.682
"Don't." And you didn't.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.975
I don't think that was it.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.935
I think it was something
like "Don't miss out."

19:45.935 --> 19:47.395
Don't miss out on living life.

19:47.395 --> 19:48.813
- And, my God, you haven't.
- That's so true.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.190
All the amazing things
you've gotten to do, Midge?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.192
- You've done
more than any of us.
- Combined.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.611
And just think of all
the stories you'll have

19:54.611 --> 19:56.029
to tell your children
when they grow up.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.280
And your grandchildren.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.657
Once you're settled,
remarried, happy,

19:59.657 --> 20:01.951
you'll always be able to look
back on this amazing chapter

20:01.951 --> 20:04.329
and say "I did that."

20:04.329 --> 20:08.541
Yeah. It's been
an amazing chapter.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.127
Oh, wait, there's more on mine.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.212
"Swing by the Piggly Wiggly
after graduation."

20:13.212 --> 20:15.506
Goddamn it, I could
have been Mrs. Dee.

20:20.678 --> 20:21.804
Whoops!

20:21.804 --> 20:23.598
Tammy, creepers, you
almost put my eye out.

20:23.598 --> 20:26.267
- Sorry.
- You're supposed
to throw 'em underhand.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.269
And you're not supposed
to try to catch them, Petra.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.146
I'm not playing anymore.

20:30.146 --> 20:33.066
- I've got to go.
- Me, too.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.401
So, let's pledge
it won't be ten years

20:35.401 --> 20:37.362
- before our next game
of drunken lawn darts?
- Yes.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.072
- Absolutely.
- Bye.

20:40.657 --> 20:42.867
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:44.243 --> 20:48.247
<i>♪ When the Swiss boy
goes calling ♪</i>

20:48.247 --> 20:51.376
<i>♪ On a Swiss miss in June ♪</i>

20:51.376 --> 20:52.919
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:52.919 --> 20:57.048
<i>♪ Toolie oolie doolie doo ♪</i>

20:57.048 --> 21:01.302
<i>♪ And make your dreams

21:06.432 --> 21:09.602
And it's confirmed.
Doubly. Triply.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.770
100%.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.563
- Through my wife? Through Hedy?
- Through Hedy.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.816
- Is she still here?
- Saw her downstairs
a minute ago.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.694
Hedy!

21:20.196 --> 21:22.031
Hedy, you stop right there!

21:22.031 --> 21:23.741
Yes, sir.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.620
- What the hell?
- This can't be good.

21:29.664 --> 21:31.374
Goddamn it, Hedy.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.919
Goddamn it.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.006
- Aw.
- Whoo!

21:38.006 --> 21:39.173
I stand corrected.

21:39.173 --> 21:40.925
I do not understand
their marriage.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.468
Okay, listen up, guys.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.845
You all know
that a certain member

21:43.845 --> 21:45.138
of the British Royal family

21:45.138 --> 21:47.056
has been on an extended tour
of North America.

21:47.056 --> 21:49.809
And you also know that
every major media outlet

21:49.809 --> 21:51.269
from San Diego to Newfoundland's

21:51.269 --> 21:53.021
been trying to book
an interview.

21:53.021 --> 21:54.689
Well, we just got
the fucking interview.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.649
Tonight, Princess Margaret

21:56.649 --> 21:59.027
will be on our show
for the full hour.

22:02.655 --> 22:06.200
This woman, this woman here,
pulled strings,

22:06.200 --> 22:08.911
flattered egos, called in
chits, and sweet-talked

22:08.911 --> 22:11.164
the supercilious ponces
that surround the princess

22:11.164 --> 22:15.126
and pulled off a miracle on the
order of loaves and fishes.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.419
Applaud for her now.

22:18.171 --> 22:21.466
He graciously left out all
the dirty things I did.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.343
Now, it's all hands
on deck, people.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.344
A lot's coming down
the pike really quick,

22:25.344 --> 22:26.804
starting with British security,

22:26.804 --> 22:28.973
so if you've stashed any muskets
or tea in your offices,

22:28.973 --> 22:30.224
remove 'em now.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.101
Mike, a lot of this is
landing on you, partner.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.102
- You ready to run?
- Hell yeah.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.353
I need the research team
to supply me

22:34.353 --> 22:36.105
with all things Margaret
and get me as much about

22:36.105 --> 22:37.815
- what she's done on this
tour so I'm caught up.
- All right.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.859
I'll run point on this, guys.
Get stuff to me by 2:00.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.402
Alvin, guys, her team
says she wants

22:41.402 --> 22:43.237
to do some sort
of comedy skit with me.

22:43.237 --> 22:45.364
- You're kidding.
- They say she doesn't want
to come off stiff,

22:45.364 --> 22:47.533
so go to town, come up with
as many pitches as you can

22:47.533 --> 22:49.911
to make her funny and bring
'em up to Mike and me ASAP.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.954
- You got it.
- And tailor the
monologue to the Royal Family.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.498
Make it funny but treat
them with respect.

22:53.498 --> 22:56.834
Ah, but poke fun at 'em, too.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.044
You know, keep it edgy.
Keep it Ford.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.129
But not too edgy.
But it's got to be funny.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.256
But not funny in a mean way.

23:02.256 --> 23:03.299
Gordon, please,
you'll pull something.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.592
Let 'em do their thing.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.302
Funny but not mean.
We got it, boss.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.054
All right.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.598
And now my morning
just got even better.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.975
Jane Jacobs, what an absolute
thrill to meet you.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.393
Hello, Gordon.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.187
Guys, this is the woman
who single-handedly

23:16.187 --> 23:18.189
stopped Robert Moses from
running a goddamn road

23:18.189 --> 23:19.982
through the middle
of Washington Square Park.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.234
Jane, my first time in New York,

23:21.234 --> 23:22.902
my parents took me to that park.

23:22.902 --> 23:26.906
My God, there were jugglers,
musicians, that fountain,

23:26.906 --> 23:29.117
a bunch of weirdos,
it was magical.

23:29.117 --> 23:31.911
I knew then I had
to live here, work here.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.496
Jane, you didn't
just save a park,

23:33.496 --> 23:35.331
you saved a memory.

23:35.331 --> 23:36.749
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:36.749 --> 23:37.917
Got to bump you tonight.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.127
I'll call you when
we got a hole to fill.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.503
Let's do this, Mike.

23:40.503 --> 23:41.879
Okay.

23:41.879 --> 23:44.507
So that was
the mysterious Hedy, huh?

23:44.507 --> 23:45.883
She pops up every now and then.

23:45.883 --> 23:47.176
The <i>Brigadoon</i> wife.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.262
Okay, so who, like me,
knows absolutely

23:49.262 --> 23:50.596
nothing about Princess Margaret?

23:50.596 --> 23:52.473
- She's the queen's sister.
- I know that much.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.142
- She's had affairs.
- We can't do affairs.

23:54.142 --> 23:56.018
- She drinks tea?
- She calls soccer "football"?

23:56.018 --> 23:57.895
She talks
like this.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.147
So we're fucked, is that
what you're telling me?

23:59.147 --> 24:00.439
The show's in seven hours.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.899
Uh, excuse me, fellas.

24:01.899 --> 24:03.860
You happen to have
a resident expert here.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.862
Really? Midge to the rescue.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.864
I love her. She's brassy.

24:07.864 --> 24:10.116
Unencumbered by the crown.
Kind of sexy.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.659
Sounds a little like
Ralph's impression.

24:11.659 --> 24:12.910
- Can she be funny?
- In a skit?

24:12.910 --> 24:14.412
I've got a couple ideas.

24:14.412 --> 24:16.372
I'll work on those while you
guys do the monologue. Deal?

24:16.372 --> 24:18.749
- Deal.
- Okay, guys, 20 in one.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.793
Shit.

24:20.793 --> 24:21.794
Sorry, Alvin.

24:21.794 --> 24:25.006
Okay, guys. 20 in one.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.217
That was funny.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.638
Tip-top and cheerio.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.765
It's <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

24:37.101 --> 24:38.728
Tonight's very special guest,

24:38.728 --> 24:41.480
for the full hour,
Her Royal Highness,

24:41.480 --> 24:43.149
the Countess of Snowden,

24:43.149 --> 24:45.651
Princess Margaret of Britain!

24:45.651 --> 24:47.195
Princess Margaret?

24:47.195 --> 24:48.529
What a score!

24:51.741 --> 24:53.826
Hey, guys.
Here again, huh?

24:53.826 --> 24:55.828
One of the writers said
we were such good laughers,

24:55.828 --> 24:57.413
he gave us an open invite
to the show.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.123
So we plan to be here
every night.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.334
Terrific. Which writer?

25:01.334 --> 25:03.252
I don't know that you two
would have ever crossed paths.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.129
- But could you point him out?
- Oh, shh-shh... shh.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.756
Good evening, everybody.

25:06.756 --> 25:08.633
You heard right,
we have real, living

25:08.633 --> 25:10.301
and breathing royalty
on the show tonight.

25:10.301 --> 25:12.720
Yes, Princess Margaret.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.889
Now, you may see some

25:14.889 --> 25:17.767
sinister-looking men in suits
around the studio today.

25:17.767 --> 25:20.519
Some of them are Princess
Margaret's security detail

25:20.519 --> 25:22.480
and some of them are my agents.

25:22.480 --> 25:25.066
Hey, you get chummy
with my in-laws?

25:25.066 --> 25:26.317
This sounds accusatory.

25:26.317 --> 25:28.027
George Bernard Shaw said
that Britain and America

25:28.027 --> 25:31.239
are two countries separated
by a common language.

25:31.239 --> 25:33.491
I observe we're
also separated by an ocean.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.034
Why do I never get the
accolades that Shaw gets?

25:36.285 --> 25:37.411
Unfair.

25:37.411 --> 25:38.913
And you know they
have different words

25:38.913 --> 25:40.414
for everything in the UK.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.124
They call an elevator a lift.

25:42.124 --> 25:44.085
They call an apartment a flat.

25:44.085 --> 25:46.629
And today I learned
they actually call me

25:46.629 --> 25:48.881
"I'm sorry, I don't believe
I've ever heard of you before."

26:04.647 --> 26:07.358
Hey, everybody, we're back
with Princess Margaret.

26:07.358 --> 26:09.402
So, Your Royal Highness,
we're always fascinated

26:09.402 --> 26:11.570
by the domestic routine
of the Royal Family.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.738
Now, you're a newlywed.

26:14.282 --> 26:16.826
I'm wondering,
what's dinner for you?

26:16.826 --> 26:18.160
Do you cook?

26:18.160 --> 26:19.745
Oh, yes, I do cook,
I'm a fabulous cook,

26:19.745 --> 26:20.997
I cook every day.

26:20.997 --> 26:22.957
It's one of two things
I'm most skilled at.

26:22.957 --> 26:24.834
- What's the other?
- Lying.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.129
So you have cooks.

26:28.129 --> 26:29.922
I believe our cooks have cooks.

26:31.299 --> 26:32.675
Now, I would
imagine that as a member

26:32.675 --> 26:34.510
of the Royal Family,
there isn't much

26:34.510 --> 26:35.803
that you haven't
been able to do.

26:35.803 --> 26:37.471
- Is that true?
- No, Gordon,
it's not.

26:37.471 --> 26:38.848
I've always had this dream

26:38.848 --> 26:41.058
that has, up till now,
gone unfulfilled.

26:41.058 --> 26:42.476
Interesting.
What is it?

26:42.476 --> 26:44.687
I've always wanted to do
a live weather report

26:44.687 --> 26:45.896
on American television.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.817
As luck would have it,
it's time for

26:49.817 --> 26:53.404
<i>The Gordon Ford Show</i>
nightly weather report.

26:53.404 --> 26:55.072
Funny coincidence, that.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.824
Now, would you like
to do it in my stead,

26:56.824 --> 26:58.367
maybe fulfill
that dream of yours?

26:58.367 --> 26:59.493
I'd be delighted.

26:59.493 --> 27:00.494
Please.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.045
All right, you're all set,
Your Royal Highness.

27:09.045 --> 27:10.254
Thank you.

27:10.254 --> 27:11.505
Good evening, America.

27:11.505 --> 27:14.008
This is Gordon Ford
with tonight's forecast.

27:14.008 --> 27:16.635
That card is wrong,
I am not Gordon Ford.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.263
Well, this was all
so spontaneous and impulsive,

27:19.263 --> 27:20.890
we had no time
to change the cue cards.

27:20.890 --> 27:22.975
Well, we are not amused.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.393
Well, we are
very sorry.

27:24.393 --> 27:27.688
On Tuesday, there will be lots
and lots of sunshine.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.231
What is that? "Sunshine"?

27:29.231 --> 27:31.859
Oh, well, it's where the sun
is out all day,

27:31.859 --> 27:33.152
unimpeded by clouds.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.112
I still have no idea
what you're talking about.

27:36.489 --> 27:39.367
Out in the Rockaways, surf
conditions will be epic.

27:39.367 --> 27:43.079
All you Gidgets and kooks should
expect some gnarly slides

27:43.079 --> 27:46.957
as you hang ten and snake
those Jersey shoobies.

27:48.626 --> 27:49.919
It's almost like you
and your writers

27:49.919 --> 27:51.670
just wanted to hear me
say those words.

27:52.797 --> 27:54.298
Well, that's impossible,
because we had no idea

27:54.298 --> 27:55.841
you were going
to do the forecast.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.802
Excuse me, what are
you doing there?

27:57.802 --> 28:00.554
Just marking which states
our army should reinvade first.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.058
Oh, not Massachusetts.
I have family there.

28:04.058 --> 28:07.520
Oh, so do I, and they still
owe taxes on their tea.

28:08.646 --> 28:10.648
Fine, take Massachusetts.

28:13.109 --> 28:14.485
- Salud.
- Salud.

28:14.485 --> 28:15.861
To a great night, team.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.947
God, she killed.
I mean, the princess killed.

28:17.947 --> 28:19.657
Damn, I'd love to see
the look on Paar's face

28:19.657 --> 28:21.075
when he sees all
the press tomorrow.

28:21.075 --> 28:22.618
Did you hear who
he had on against us?

28:22.618 --> 28:24.245
Kukla, Fran and Ollie.

28:24.245 --> 28:26.330
Puppets. He had puppets.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.249
And I heard you could see
the goddamn puppeteer's arm

28:28.249 --> 28:29.417
sticking out of Kukla's ass.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.001
Poor Kukla.

28:31.001 --> 28:33.212
Oh, this is our Emmy, guys.
I can feel it.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.839
This had the weight,
this had the edge.

28:34.839 --> 28:36.132
We got to get the network
into a campaign.

28:36.132 --> 28:37.216
First thing tomorrow.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.592
You know
the news department called?

28:38.592 --> 28:40.219
They are gobsmacked
that we got her.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.971
Huntley and Brinkley
are humiliated.

28:41.971 --> 28:43.597
Oh, God, that makes me so happy.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.641
Eddie, drinks for
the whole house.

28:45.641 --> 28:46.934
Every person in here.

28:48.686 --> 28:49.979
We did it.

28:49.979 --> 28:52.731
Got to spend a penny.
Maybe a nickel.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.191
Keep the change, please.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.736
Hello.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.780
Oh. Hello.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.657
- I'm Hedy Ford.
- I know.

29:01.657 --> 29:02.992
It's nice to officially
meet you.

29:02.992 --> 29:04.493
- Midge Maisel.
- I know.

29:04.493 --> 29:07.371
I've been wanting to meet you
for quite some time.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.957
Gordon's first lady writer.

29:09.957 --> 29:11.250
First of many, perhaps.

29:12.460 --> 29:15.754
Oh, sure, things will be
completely different now.

29:20.134 --> 29:21.510
The princess was
extremely pleased

29:21.510 --> 29:22.636
with how it went tonight.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.638
"Chuffed" was the word she used.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.599
She killed. We were just saying.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.350
She's not sure her sister's
going to be too thrilled,

29:28.350 --> 29:30.144
which seemed to amuse
Margaret even more.

29:30.144 --> 29:31.770
What would it have all been for

29:31.770 --> 29:33.606
if we didn't ruffle
the queen's feathers?

29:33.606 --> 29:35.608
I understand you wrote
the weather report bit.

29:35.608 --> 29:38.027
I came up with the concept.
The boys helped make it funny.

29:38.027 --> 29:39.862
- Don't.
- What?

29:39.862 --> 29:41.322
Don't.

29:41.322 --> 29:42.865
- Okay.
- If the credit's yours,

29:42.865 --> 29:45.451
take it. If it's not, take it.
That's what the boys do.

29:46.744 --> 29:49.413
Okay. Well, yeah.

29:49.413 --> 29:50.456
The bit was mine.

29:50.456 --> 29:53.167
Good. I'll be seeing you.

29:53.167 --> 29:57.129
Oh, hey, how long have you
been working with Susan?

29:57.129 --> 29:58.339
Susan?

29:58.339 --> 30:00.674
Myerson. She's your
manager, isn't she?

30:00.674 --> 30:05.095
Ah, Susie. Uh, going on
three years now.

30:05.095 --> 30:06.597
I was her first client.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.265
I bet she's done well by you.

30:08.265 --> 30:09.600
She's always been tenacious.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.143
A real fighter.

30:11.143 --> 30:14.313
I know, I've had to hold
her back from a few.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.899
I-I'm still catching up here.
H-How do you know her?

30:16.899 --> 30:18.901
Pembroke, class of '48.
We were roommates.

30:18.901 --> 30:20.736
She never mentioned that.

30:20.736 --> 30:23.739
Well... you know Susan.

30:23.739 --> 30:27.535
- Yes. I know Susan.
- Hedy!

30:27.535 --> 30:32.581
Coming. He worries when I talk
to writers. And architects.

30:32.581 --> 30:34.458
Keep up the good work.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.418
And with Susan in your corner,

30:36.418 --> 30:38.295
I'd say you're going
places, cutie.

30:38.295 --> 30:42.049
- See you.
- Yes. See you.

30:45.553 --> 30:46.762
- There she is.
- Hey.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.430
- Miss me?
- No.

31:02.194 --> 31:06.365
Hey, what the hell
are you doing here?

31:06.365 --> 31:09.410
Dinah gave me your train info.
You were in Baltimore?

31:09.410 --> 31:10.995
Had to hold James's hand a bit.

31:10.995 --> 31:12.997
We had a little miscommunication.

31:12.997 --> 31:14.290
- What are you--
- You know Hedy Ford?

31:14.290 --> 31:16.208
What are you talking about?

31:16.208 --> 31:19.295
You knew her when she
was Hedy... Not-Ford.

31:19.295 --> 31:21.297
- You met Hedy?
- She came up to me at the bar,

31:21.297 --> 31:23.048
told me you were
friends in college.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.133
We weren't friends.

31:24.133 --> 31:25.718
She says you were roommates.

31:25.718 --> 31:26.885
Maybe.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.179
Maybe you were roommates?
You didn't notice?

31:29.179 --> 31:30.472
There were like ten,
20 to a room.

31:30.472 --> 31:33.142
- Susie.
- College is big, okay?

31:33.142 --> 31:35.060
You can't know everyone
you went to college with.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.604
She calls you Susan.

31:36.604 --> 31:38.188
No one calls you Susan.

31:38.188 --> 31:41.317
What is this, an ambush?

31:41.317 --> 31:42.985
I'm tired.
Can we talk in the morning?

31:42.985 --> 31:44.403
Why didn't you tell me?

31:44.403 --> 31:46.739
I don't tell you about
everybody I've met in my life.

31:46.739 --> 31:47.823
Stop it.

31:51.035 --> 31:53.245
I knew her a little, okay?

31:53.245 --> 31:55.164
And you didn't think it
was worth maybe mentioning

31:55.164 --> 31:57.708
that you knew my boss's
very influential wife,

31:57.708 --> 31:59.084
even a little?

31:59.084 --> 32:01.211
Hey, don't believe anything
she said to you, okay?

32:01.211 --> 32:02.588
Was she bad-mouthing me?

32:02.588 --> 32:04.506
She said you were tenacious.

32:04.506 --> 32:06.634
Well, she's getting her money's
worth on that English degree.

32:06.634 --> 32:08.093
And that you were a fighter.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.720
Anyone who's ever walked
into the Gaslight knows that.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.473
So fight for me, Susie.

32:12.473 --> 32:13.724
Talk to her.

32:13.724 --> 32:15.809
- Wait a minute.
- She has sway with Gordon.

32:15.809 --> 32:17.770
More than anyone,
more than Mike Carr,

32:17.770 --> 32:19.730
- she's our way in.
- No.

32:19.730 --> 32:22.066
Tell her to tell Gordon
to book me.

32:22.066 --> 32:24.943
We don't need her, okay?
I got this.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.320
How have you "got" this?

32:26.320 --> 32:27.613
I got this.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.948
That's how I got this.
We are making progress.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.533
Toward what, another brick wall?

32:31.533 --> 32:32.701
That is not fair.

32:32.701 --> 32:33.744
It's not.

32:33.744 --> 32:35.621
You've worked
your ass off, Susie,

32:35.621 --> 32:37.081
and I've done
everything you said.

32:37.081 --> 32:39.833
I-I've stayed sharp.
I've been a good soldier,

32:39.833 --> 32:43.003
I bat a thousand at work
every day, and he notices.

32:43.003 --> 32:45.631
It would make so much sense
for him to give me a shot,

32:45.631 --> 32:47.549
but he will not be moved.

32:47.549 --> 32:49.885
That fucking brick wall
keeps hitting us both

32:49.885 --> 32:51.011
smack in the face.

32:51.011 --> 32:52.137
It's two steps forward,

32:52.137 --> 32:54.890
three steps back,
and I'm tired of it.

32:54.890 --> 32:56.642
So am I.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.268
But what do you do
about the Gordons

32:58.268 --> 33:00.187
and the Petes
and all the fucking men

33:00.187 --> 33:01.730
that run the fucking world?

33:01.730 --> 33:03.482
You go around them.

33:03.482 --> 33:06.777
You use whatever you can
and you stop at nothing.

33:06.777 --> 33:09.196
Guess who taught me that.

33:09.196 --> 33:13.492
This is not enough,
do you understand?

33:13.492 --> 33:15.661
Call me selfish,
but I want more.

33:15.661 --> 33:18.664
This, what we're doing,

33:18.664 --> 33:20.165
what these last three years
have been,

33:20.165 --> 33:22.584
this is not a story
to tell my grandchildren.

33:22.584 --> 33:23.794
This is not just a chapter.

33:23.794 --> 33:25.963
Who said it was just a chapter?

33:25.963 --> 33:27.381
You stormed into a bathhouse

33:27.381 --> 33:30.050
- and hopped over dicks
to get James that movie.
- Yeah?

33:30.050 --> 33:32.803
Well, I want you to hop
over dicks for me.

33:32.803 --> 33:35.639
Oh, I have hopped over plenty
of dicks for you, Missy.

33:35.639 --> 33:37.891
For three years, I've done
nothing but hop over dicks.

33:37.891 --> 33:39.601
Well, you got one more
dick to hop over.

33:39.601 --> 33:40.894
Talk to Hedy.

33:40.894 --> 33:43.021
- No.
- Why?

33:43.021 --> 33:45.941
Just stop and think, okay?

33:45.941 --> 33:48.110
Do you really want to make it
by having me call in

33:48.110 --> 33:49.903
a favor to some chick
I went to college with?

33:49.903 --> 33:52.906
Yes. Of course.
Have you not been listening?

33:52.906 --> 33:54.241
After all the hard work
you've done?

33:54.241 --> 33:55.659
This is how you want
to get your break?

33:55.659 --> 33:56.910
Oh, my God, yes.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.537
Who cares how it happens?

33:58.537 --> 34:00.164
Look, picture yourself
in ten years.

34:00.164 --> 34:02.499
You are a big star,
you're on a talk show,

34:02.499 --> 34:04.877
and the guy asks you
how you got your start.

34:04.877 --> 34:06.545
You don't want to say
you had to call in

34:06.545 --> 34:08.005
a favor from your manager.

34:08.005 --> 34:10.799
I'm not going to be on that
show if you don't do this.

34:12.301 --> 34:14.344
This is it, Susie.

34:14.344 --> 34:16.638
Talk to her.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.226
If you don't, I'll always
know there's something

34:21.226 --> 34:22.936
you could've done
and you didn't.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.938
And honestly?

34:25.939 --> 34:28.692
I don't know where
we go from there.

34:42.790 --> 34:44.708
Thank you.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.256
Arthur, you're gonna have
some wine, aren't you?

34:51.256 --> 34:52.841
Of course I'm going to.
If you pour it, I'll--

34:52.841 --> 34:55.093
- Gabe.
- Abe.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.220
- You know Arthur?
- Hi, Abe.

34:56.220 --> 34:57.221
- Arthur.
- This is Henry.

34:57.221 --> 34:58.680
- Pleasure.
- Henry.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.516
We've been debating what to
drink for ten minutes now.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.684
You're debating, I'm drinking.

35:02.684 --> 35:04.019
Doesn't count if
you brought it from home.

35:04.019 --> 35:05.938
Ha ha. I didn't.

35:05.938 --> 35:07.940
- I figured as much.
- Can you
recommend a red wine

35:07.940 --> 35:11.026
without using the words
"tannic" or "fruit-forward"?

35:11.026 --> 35:12.736
Henry, don't torture
the young man.

35:12.736 --> 35:14.238
Abe, are you in for some red?

35:14.238 --> 35:16.323
I think I'll skip. I have
a lot of work to do tomorrow.

35:16.323 --> 35:19.159
Abe, the <i>Village Voice</i> does not
encourage employee sobriety.

35:19.159 --> 35:21.745
In fact, it thrives on
its employee's crapulence.

35:21.745 --> 35:23.705
Now drink, damn it,
or you are fired.

35:23.705 --> 35:26.750
An underused word,
"crapulence." For a reason.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.127
There's a hostile mood
at this table tonight.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.171
Wine is good. Wine is fine.

35:31.171 --> 35:32.256
We'll have
this Bordeaux here,

35:32.256 --> 35:33.632
the '56 Château Margaux.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.592
Very good, sir.
That's an acidic wine,

35:35.592 --> 35:37.010
a bit angular for some.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.679
Are you trying to kill me?

35:38.679 --> 35:40.305
Bring the wine
and I will muzzle Henry.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.807
Stop it, Henry.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.226
- What?
- Really, I'll have
you removed.

35:44.226 --> 35:45.602
I sold my place in the Hamptons.

35:45.602 --> 35:46.937
The Montauk spread? When?

35:46.937 --> 35:48.564
Last year. I was tired
of the upkeep,

35:48.564 --> 35:49.982
and the property values
out there,

35:49.982 --> 35:51.275
they're not going up
anytime soon.

35:51.275 --> 35:52.943
Or ever. There's nothing
out there.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.570
- Exactly.
- Hey, did you
see Princess Margaret

35:54.570 --> 35:56.572
on <i>Gordon Ford?</i>
She was hysterical.

35:56.572 --> 35:58.740
- You're kidding.
- Queen Victoria
was supposedly a hoot.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.158
I never knew that.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.119
I saw that movie,
it was delightful.

36:02.119 --> 36:03.287
<i>The Absent-Minded
Professor</i> ?

36:03.287 --> 36:04.705
With the flying car?
That movie?

36:04.705 --> 36:07.499
At Radio City. I'm a huge
Fred MacMurray fan.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.959
Tell me you were
with a grandchild.

36:08.959 --> 36:12.462
It seems like pablum,
but Fred MacMurray elevates it.

36:12.462 --> 36:14.214
I don't even think
Fred MacMurray's family

36:14.214 --> 36:15.757
is that into Fred MacMurray.

36:15.757 --> 36:18.093
I ignore them now.
Birthdays. No point.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.553
Have you forgotten
the little boy in you, Henry?

36:19.553 --> 36:21.597
Gifts are the point.

36:21.597 --> 36:24.516
I can't remember the
last time I got a gift I liked.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.519
So, Abe, before you
got here, I was raving

36:27.519 --> 36:29.813
about your conversational
skills to Arthur and Henry.

36:29.813 --> 36:33.108
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I've been such a drip.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.985
Was it because Gabe
said "crapulence"?

36:34.985 --> 36:36.445
Yes, that was upsetting.

36:36.445 --> 36:39.031
No, I'm...

36:40.240 --> 36:41.325
Abe?

36:42.618 --> 36:45.454
It's just the whole
goddamn world. You know?

36:45.454 --> 36:48.332
- Only that?
- Ah, I'm getting maudlin.

36:48.332 --> 36:50.250
What about the world, Abe?

36:51.543 --> 36:53.003
I've just turned 64.

36:53.003 --> 36:58.050
And at a time when I should
be comfortable, settled

36:58.050 --> 37:01.053
in body, in mind... I'm not.

37:01.053 --> 37:05.349
At all. I suddenly find
myself at a crossroads.

37:05.349 --> 37:08.060
And everything
feels upside down.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.270
That's because
everything is changing

37:10.270 --> 37:13.023
at such an ungodly pace, Abe.

37:13.023 --> 37:14.900
Especially for men our age.

37:14.900 --> 37:18.153
- Men our age...
- We were born
in the 1800s.

37:18.153 --> 37:19.488
A different century.

37:19.488 --> 37:21.573
Before phones, before radio.

37:21.573 --> 37:25.035
My parents' house had
no electricity till I was seven.

37:25.035 --> 37:26.536
One can't keep up.

37:26.536 --> 37:30.499
Yes, and it's physiological
as much it is psychological.

37:30.499 --> 37:33.377
Homo sapiens crawled along,
playing the same roles

37:33.377 --> 37:35.796
for tens and tens
of thousands of years,

37:35.796 --> 37:37.839
and now, suddenly,
we're forced to adapt

37:37.839 --> 37:39.424
to this rapid-fire change.

37:39.424 --> 37:42.594
More change in a year
than our predecessors

37:42.594 --> 37:44.388
experienced in a lifetime,
in a millennium.

37:44.388 --> 37:45.389
Think about it.

37:45.389 --> 37:47.557
Change, to our predecessors,

37:47.557 --> 37:49.351
were sudden exogenous events:

37:49.351 --> 37:51.687
earthquakes, floods, an eclipse,

37:51.687 --> 37:54.564
a saber-toothed tiger
lunging at you out of nowhere.

37:54.564 --> 37:56.984
They were things to be
dealt with, in the moment.

37:56.984 --> 38:00.028
Then things naturally
reverted back to the norm.

38:00.028 --> 38:01.571
But now...

38:01.571 --> 38:02.698
change happens over you.

38:02.698 --> 38:03.740
Change itself is the flood,

38:03.740 --> 38:05.659
change itself is
the saber-toothed.

38:05.659 --> 38:07.202
Change itself is the norm.

38:07.202 --> 38:10.956
My fear, though, is that
the world is as it always was,

38:10.956 --> 38:13.208
and I just didn't see it.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.211
That a lot of us didn't
see it. Us men.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.171
I had a feeling
we'd get gender-specific.

38:18.171 --> 38:21.800
I'm serious. We can't blame
exogenous events.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.010
It's too easy.

38:23.010 --> 38:26.972
Our collective blindness
has caused a lot of harm.

38:26.972 --> 38:30.809
We controlled so much,
meddled so much,

38:30.809 --> 38:32.519
and to what end?

38:32.519 --> 38:33.979
- That's one man's perception.
- Exactly.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.105
And perception is tricky.

38:35.105 --> 38:37.607
We all interpret through
the lens of ourselves.

38:37.607 --> 38:39.735
Man and woman. That's natural.

38:39.735 --> 38:42.404
That we must have shared
with the hunter-gatherers.

38:42.404 --> 38:43.947
Menus, gentlemen.

38:43.947 --> 38:49.036
The fish tonight is a Dover
sole prepared one of two ways:

38:49.036 --> 38:53.707
traditional meunière
or a citrus beurre blanc sauce.

38:53.707 --> 38:55.417
Thank you. I've had
the Dover sole before.

38:55.417 --> 38:56.960
It's terrific.

38:56.960 --> 39:00.630
You know, I had
a moment the other day.

39:00.630 --> 39:03.258
I-I live in this big
old apartment on Amsterdam.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.802
Bought it decades ago,
everyone thought I was crazy,

39:05.802 --> 39:08.555
all that money,
now I look like a genius.

39:08.555 --> 39:11.850
And my wife and I,
she-she's passed,

39:11.850 --> 39:16.146
we-we spent countless hours
outfitting it, decorating it.

39:16.146 --> 39:19.191
We took such pride,
everything in the right place.

39:19.191 --> 39:24.154
And one day, not that long ago,

39:24.154 --> 39:27.199
I stood in the living room
and looked around,

39:27.199 --> 39:32.079
and all I saw... was stuff.

39:32.079 --> 39:36.583
Just stuff.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.752
It was the strangest feeling.

39:38.752 --> 39:42.005
As if I'd never seen
any of it before.

39:42.005 --> 39:45.425
And so much of it was tied
to the memory of my wife.

39:45.425 --> 39:49.429
We were together 40 years,
but it didn't matter.

39:49.429 --> 39:51.014
All I could picture
was my children

39:51.014 --> 39:52.557
picking through it all,

39:52.557 --> 39:56.853
choosing what to keep,
what to sell, what to...

39:56.853 --> 40:00.357
throw in the trash heap.

40:00.357 --> 40:03.652
My life.

40:03.652 --> 40:05.904
My wife.

40:05.904 --> 40:08.365
In piles.

40:08.365 --> 40:14.830
It was a warm day,
but I suddenly felt very cold.

40:14.830 --> 40:16.331
Look, I believe
in free will.

40:16.331 --> 40:19.209
We are not robots.
We can change. For the better.

40:19.209 --> 40:21.086
We do adapt.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.880
And sometimes what others
perceive as meddling, Abe,

40:23.880 --> 40:26.007
is actually teaching.

40:26.007 --> 40:28.051
You were a teacher
most of your life.

40:28.051 --> 40:29.719
We pass along our knowledge.
That's natural.

40:29.719 --> 40:31.138
My son. Bright boy.

40:31.138 --> 40:34.683
Warned me again and again
that I was smothering him.

40:34.683 --> 40:36.810
I thought I was guiding him.

40:36.810 --> 40:39.187
Then he moved out,
he stopped calling.

40:39.187 --> 40:40.730
He stopped...

40:43.191 --> 40:46.611
We teach, yes, but we foist.

40:46.611 --> 40:48.446
I certainly do.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.907
I think I emerged from my
mother's womb giving advice

40:50.907 --> 40:54.828
on how to deal with
the umbilical cord.

40:54.828 --> 40:57.789
I'm having one
of your moments, Arthur.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.333
I'm seeing the piles of my life,

41:00.333 --> 41:02.377
and they're foreign to me.

41:02.377 --> 41:04.379
This is about
your family, right?

41:04.379 --> 41:06.298
You tried to help.
You tried to guide.

41:06.298 --> 41:08.133
Mistakes were made.
Everybody makes mistakes.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.427
- I don't like this wine.
- Everything I thought

41:10.427 --> 41:12.721
about the roles of men and women

41:12.721 --> 41:15.432
I think is completely wrong.

41:15.432 --> 41:18.059
I have done exactly
the wrong thing

41:18.059 --> 41:19.477
for both my children.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.104
No, Abe. Not true.

41:21.104 --> 41:22.189
You know...

41:22.189 --> 41:25.066
my daughter owns the
apartment I'm living in?

41:25.066 --> 41:26.818
I thought you bought it.
Didn't you say that?

41:26.818 --> 41:29.571
My wife came up with that,
our cover story.

41:29.571 --> 41:32.240
No, my daughter bought it.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.700
My daughter...

41:33.700 --> 41:37.412
My daughter was dumped
by her husband, out of nowhere.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.748
That was her saber-toothed.

41:39.748 --> 41:42.500
Instead of collapsing
from the weight,

41:42.500 --> 41:45.962
she emerged stronger.

41:45.962 --> 41:49.716
A new person, so I thought.

41:49.716 --> 41:51.885
But now I think...

41:51.885 --> 41:55.222
perhaps that was who
she was all along.

41:57.140 --> 42:00.101
I never really took
her seriously.

42:00.101 --> 42:02.812
My son Noah I took seriously.

42:02.812 --> 42:06.399
I would take him to Columbia
with me every week

42:06.399 --> 42:10.820
so he could dream
of what he could be.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.950
I don't remember
if I ever did that for Miriam.

42:14.950 --> 42:16.952
I don't think
it ever occurred to me.

42:16.952 --> 42:21.998
And as unfathomable as this
career choice of hers is,

42:21.998 --> 42:25.293
she's doing it on her own.

42:25.293 --> 42:29.214
With no help from me
or her mother.

42:29.214 --> 42:31.466
Where did this come from?

42:31.466 --> 42:37.347
This strength,
this fearlessness that...

42:37.347 --> 42:39.641
that I never had.

42:39.641 --> 42:43.687
That my poor son never had.

42:45.230 --> 42:48.817
What could she have been
if I had helped her

42:48.817 --> 42:53.947
and not ignored her,
ignored who she really is?

42:56.533 --> 42:59.661
My daughter is
a remarkable person,

42:59.661 --> 43:02.747
and I don't think
I've ever said that to her.

43:06.501 --> 43:07.711
We should probably order.

43:07.711 --> 43:10.714
Excuse me, I think we're ready.

43:10.714 --> 43:13.508
H-How is your
chicken prepared?

43:13.508 --> 43:15.760
It is lightly
seasoned, sage-rubbed,

43:15.760 --> 43:18.013
and stuffed with
the finest foie gras

43:18.013 --> 43:19.389
from the Dordogne Valley.

43:19.389 --> 43:21.182
He had to ask.

43:21.182 --> 43:23.393
It's been what, two years?
Are you trying to avoid us?

43:23.393 --> 43:25.186
John's been on the road
since Christmas.

43:25.186 --> 43:26.730
All work and no play, Johnny.

43:26.730 --> 43:28.189
- How's the gallery?
- Hopping.

43:28.189 --> 43:29.899
You should drop in.
Lots of new stuff.

43:29.899 --> 43:30.942
What time do you open?

43:30.942 --> 43:33.820
We, um...

43:33.820 --> 43:36.781
We open at 10:00, but I
usually swing in around noon.

43:36.781 --> 43:40.035
Come then. Uh, I have a piece
by Helen Frankenthaler

43:40.035 --> 43:41.578
that I think you
are going to love.

43:41.578 --> 43:43.038
- We'll see you then.
- Bye, Hedy.

43:43.038 --> 43:44.664
Ciao, you two.

43:49.919 --> 43:54.007
Well... I must say
I'm surprised to see you.

43:54.007 --> 43:55.550
Well, I'm full of surprises.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.302
- I'm happy that you're--
- I got business

43:57.302 --> 43:58.928
for Mrs. Gordon Ford.

43:58.928 --> 44:00.680
That's me.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.599
Get my girl on the show.

44:02.599 --> 44:03.641
I'm sorry, what?

44:03.641 --> 44:05.727
Midge Maisel. She's a comedian.

44:05.727 --> 44:07.854
And she needs a break.
And she needs it now.

44:07.854 --> 44:10.482
And you want me
to talk to Gordon?

44:10.482 --> 44:13.568
Yes. As a favor to me,

44:13.568 --> 44:14.861
I would like you
to talk to Gordon.

44:14.861 --> 44:16.112
Hmm.

44:16.112 --> 44:18.698
She's a good writer.
Is she a good comedian?

44:18.698 --> 44:20.075
She's ready.

44:20.075 --> 44:22.202
- You really believe
in this girl.
- I do.

44:22.202 --> 44:24.245
Is it more than that?

44:26.915 --> 44:28.625
Look, Gordon doesn't do
everything I ask of him.

44:28.625 --> 44:31.252

He's out tonight. And I may
not see him till morning.

44:34.798 --> 44:36.883
Hmm. Quite the fairy tale,

44:40.929 --> 44:42.097

I have a request.

45:32.313 --> 45:33.314
Did my mother get to you?

45:33.314 --> 45:34.482
No. Why?

45:34.482 --> 45:35.817
She wants us
at Thanksgiving this year.

45:35.817 --> 45:37.026
Oh, she says that every year

45:37.026 --> 45:38.153
after she gets drunk and cries

45:38.153 --> 45:39.737
that no one complimented
her turkey.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.448
We avoided it for three years.
Pretty good run.

45:41.448 --> 45:42.740
Having notice helps.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.325
So, what's up?

45:45.785 --> 45:47.579
You know, occasionally
I swan in here

45:47.579 --> 45:50.039
in a fabulous new necklace
and suggest a thing or two

45:50.039 --> 45:52.208
I think you should do.

45:52.208 --> 45:53.376
Occasionally, yes.

45:53.376 --> 45:54.669
And I often take
those suggestions

45:54.669 --> 45:55.837
and compliment the necklace.

45:55.837 --> 45:58.548
I want you to book
Midge Maisel on the show.

45:58.548 --> 46:00.550
Midge? No.

46:00.550 --> 46:01.676
Yes.

46:01.676 --> 46:03.553
Hedy, come on.
You know we have a rule.

46:03.553 --> 46:06.264
That was George's rule, Gordon,
then it became your rule.

46:06.264 --> 46:09.058
Good God, you have no idea
why you have this rule.

46:09.058 --> 46:11.519
You read "The Lottery,"
you see what happens when

46:11.519 --> 46:14.355
there are traditions for
no reason, people get stoned.

46:14.355 --> 46:15.815
Drop the damn rule.

46:15.815 --> 46:17.150
Okay, why the screed?

46:17.150 --> 46:18.735
That wasn't a screed. Book her.

46:18.735 --> 46:19.986
What am I missing here?

46:21.154 --> 46:23.573
She's easy on
the eyes, isn't she?

46:25.742 --> 46:27.368
You have eyes.

46:27.368 --> 46:28.786
Okay, what's the angle here?

46:28.786 --> 46:30.330
Angle is, I'm asking
you to do this.

46:30.330 --> 46:31.664
Telling me, you mean.

46:31.664 --> 46:34.501
Strongly asking you to do this.

46:34.501 --> 46:37.086
Why? Why should I do this?

46:39.297 --> 46:41.674
Because you owe me.

46:43.426 --> 46:44.802
This is how you're
gonna play this?

46:44.802 --> 46:47.972
