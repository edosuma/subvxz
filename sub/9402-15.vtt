I'm Chase,
your new Big Brother.

00:03.271 --> 00:04.688
<i>Chuck!</i>

00:04.772 --> 00:05.838
Thanks for hanging out
with me.

00:05.890 --> 00:08.858
Hey, I know you.
You're my bartender.

00:08.943 --> 00:10.226
Bar <i>manager.</i>

00:10.311 --> 00:12.228
People cannot be trusted.

00:12.313 --> 00:16.116
Contracts, on the other hand,
<i>can</i> be trusted.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.867
Seems Mr. Scott
disagrees with me.

00:17.952 --> 00:19.352
But the guy
is a nightmare.

00:19.403 --> 00:21.204
He gets off
on humiliating everyone.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.073
Didn't you take this guy's class
'cause it was tough?

00:23.157 --> 00:24.691
I don't have a problem
with him being tough.

00:24.742 --> 00:26.242
I have a problem
with him being a bully.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.695
I want you to move in tomorrow
or even tonight, if you can.

00:30.081 --> 00:32.048
Or is that too fast?

00:36.036 --> 00:39.005
They didn't
just tell me that...

00:39.056 --> 00:42.041
That I wasn't pregnant.

00:42.093 --> 00:43.876
They said
I'm never gonna be.

00:43.928 --> 00:46.212
You can't have children?
They told you that?

I'm sure he has something
really nice planned for you.

09:13.223 --> 09:14.891
Shower.

09:20.064 --> 09:21.948
I thought we'd just go
to Tric.

09:22.015 --> 09:24.534
Ooh, after a romantic dinner
somewhere fancy?

09:24.618 --> 09:26.018
Here's something
you don't know about me --

09:26.070 --> 09:27.186
not such a fan
of the Valentine's day.

09:27.237 --> 09:28.905
But you said it was hot.

09:28.989 --> 09:30.957
Oh, yeah, but that was after
you let me touch your butt.

09:31.024 --> 09:33.359
But I think it's
a completely bogus holiday.

09:33.410 --> 09:35.745
Well,
I think it's romantic.

09:35.829 --> 09:36.829
Amateur romantic.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.364
It's a bunch of dudes
with no game

09:38.415 --> 09:39.966
scrambling for flowers
and jewelry.

09:40.033 --> 09:41.918
I like flowers
and jewelry.

09:42.002 --> 09:43.553
All women like flowers
and jewelry.

09:43.637 --> 09:45.588
And that's why they invented
Valentine's day --

09:45.672 --> 09:47.390
so they could leverage
every boyfriend, fiancé,

09:47.474 --> 09:49.058
and husband in America.

09:49.143 --> 09:50.426
Really? Leverage?

09:50.511 --> 09:52.478
Leverage. Yeah, Valentine's day
should be ashamed

09:52.546 --> 09:53.896
to even call itself
a holiday.

09:53.981 --> 09:56.599
You know, if I'm Christmas
or Easter or the fourth of July,

09:56.683 --> 09:58.651
there's no way
I'm letting Valentine's day

09:58.718 --> 09:59.902
sit at the lunch table.

09:59.987 --> 10:01.437
It's like,
"go on, February 14th.

10:01.522 --> 10:03.940
Go sit on the steps near
shop class with Cinco de Mayo."

10:04.024 --> 10:06.492
What's wrong
with Cinco de Mayo?

10:06.560 --> 10:08.894
Okay,

11:15.429 --> 11:17.313
No, I'm sticking
with shoelaces.

11:17.397 --> 11:19.182

"I like you,"

isn't too mushy.

we're gonna find that one here.

What if I told you that
there was a college prospect

12:16.540 --> 12:17.823
right here in Tree Hill

12:17.875 --> 12:20.076
who threw 98 miles an hour
accurately,

12:20.160 --> 12:22.545
was on the radar
of every major league team,

12:22.629 --> 12:24.029
and didn't have an Agent?

12:24.081 --> 12:25.298
Would you sign him?

12:25.365 --> 12:27.166
No, because
if he's really that good,

12:27.217 --> 12:29.669
then there must be a reason
he doesn't have an Agent.

12:29.720 --> 12:32.538
Okay.
Let me try this.

12:32.589 --> 12:35.057

his name was Kellerman?

12:35.142 --> 12:36.875

Professor Kellerman?

12:36.927 --> 12:39.979

Millicent,
you've had quite a journey.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.353
You started out as an assistant
at Clothes Over Bros,

13:24.421 --> 13:26.388
rose to the very top
of the company,

13:26.456 --> 13:28.390
and even became the face
of the brand

13:28.458 --> 13:29.925

on the outside looking in.

13:32.629 --> 13:35.180

these days?

13:35.248 --> 13:37.449

I'm unemployed,

13:37.517 --> 13:40.152

being fake-interviewed

13:40.236 --> 13:41.904

17:25.962 --> 17:27.546

17:32.168 --> 17:35.671

17:45.315 --> 17:46.348

18:05.168 --> 18:08.253
Well, I saw the tiger escape

18:53.792 --> 18:55.876
I thought Clay said
the concert was sold out.

18:55.943 --> 18:58.078
I thought that Nathan said
he didn't get you anything.

18:58.129 --> 19:00.080
You make a good point.

19:00.131 --> 19:01.632
You know what?

19:01.716 --> 19:03.834
I bet they're not even meeting
with a player.

19:03.918 --> 19:05.219
They're probably both out

19:12.227 --> 19:14.261
No, I don't think so.
You?

19:14.312 --> 19:16.180
Not really.

19:19.434 --> 19:21.635
We shouldn't
sign Kellerman.

19:21.686 --> 19:25.639
No, we walk away from talent
if the athlete's a jackass.

19:25.707 --> 19:27.741
This guy's a jackass.

19:27.809 --> 19:29.126
I don't disagree,

19:29.194 --> 19:31.779
but do you know any other
young athletes who were a mess

19:31.846 --> 19:33.781
and then eventually
found their way?

19:33.832 --> 19:36.166
You mean you?
I do.

19:36.251 --> 19:38.519
The kid's got
a difficult father,

19:38.586 --> 19:40.754
and he feels like
the world owes him something.

19:40.822 --> 19:42.406
I've been there.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.925
Just let me talk to him again
before we move on.

19:44.992 --> 19:48.796
You want to help Ian Kellerman
or just screw with his father?

19:48.847 --> 19:50.664
I don't know.

19:50.715 --> 19:52.483
Maybe both.

20:03.361 --> 20:07.981
Ahh. Yep, another
Valentine's day alone.

20:08.049 --> 20:09.516

20:09.567 --> 20:11.518
Well, more for you.

20:11.569 --> 20:12.736

20:16.074 --> 20:17.624

20:19.928 --> 20:21.695

20:21.746 --> 20:23.363
Yeah, nothing says nice
like a punch in the gut

20:23.414 --> 20:25.999
and some kid yelling,
"Chuck!"

20:26.050 --> 20:28.201
I'm making this Valentine
for my mom.

20:32.039 --> 20:33.791
That's a start.

20:33.858 --> 20:35.676
All I'm saying is,

20:35.727 --> 20:37.544
people are gonna like you
for who you are.

20:37.595 --> 20:40.597
Like, what are your hobbies?
What do you like to do?

20:40.682 --> 20:43.433
Well, there is this one thing
that I like

20:43.518 --> 20:45.185
that I never told anyone.

20:45.253 --> 20:46.937
Yeah?

20:47.021 --> 20:49.406
Uh-huh.
Show tunes.

20:49.491 --> 20:52.493
Didn't see that one
coming.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.861
Okay.

20:53.912 --> 20:55.696
So, you listen
to show tunes.

20:55.747 --> 20:57.898
Not just listen to them.
I write my own.

20:57.949 --> 21:00.050
Right.

21:00.118 --> 21:01.952
Um, you know, that "punch
in the stomach" thing

21:02.036 --> 21:03.003
is kind of cool,
actually.

21:03.070 --> 21:04.204
