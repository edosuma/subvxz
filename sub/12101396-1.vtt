WEBVTT

01:03.413 --> 01:05.615
This is where she did it.

01:05.649 --> 01:08.385
Right here in this room.

01:08.418 --> 01:09.754
The dorms were different
back then,

01:09.787 --> 01:13.323
but the showers
have always been the same.

01:13.356 --> 01:15.993
She ran a tap over her wrist,

01:16.027 --> 01:19.797
and then sliced it open
with a razor.

01:19.831 --> 01:25.703
Then she lay her head back
and drowned in her blood.

01:25.737 --> 01:26.804
They say her heart
stopped beating

01:26.838 --> 01:29.774
at exactly 3:13 a.m.

01:29.807 --> 01:32.542
Yvonne, what time is it?

01:32.576 --> 01:36.379
3:12, one minute till.

01:36.413 --> 01:40.383
I don't believe any of this.
Nothing's gonna happen.

01:40.417 --> 01:43.654
Well, Kerrie, we'll know
soon enough, won't we?

01:43.688 --> 01:46.891
It's exactly 3:13...

01:46.924 --> 01:49.493
now.

01:49.526 --> 01:52.596
Are you ready?

01:52.629 --> 01:55.332
Edelvine ghost,
rise up to us.

01:55.365 --> 02:00.604
Edelvine ghost, rise up to us.
Edelvine ghost, rise up to us.

02:00.637 --> 02:02.673
Aw, what's the matter, Kerrie?

02:02.707 --> 02:05.009
Forget the words?

02:05.042 --> 02:06.744
It doesn't matter anyway.

02:06.778 --> 02:09.513
It should still work
for you all.

02:09.546 --> 02:11.548
She's supposed to appear
behind you.

02:11.581 --> 02:14.551
Do you see anyone else
in the mirror?

02:17.655 --> 02:21.491
See? Told you it wasn't real.
It's just...

02:24.461 --> 02:26.396
Did you guys hear that?

02:31.969 --> 02:33.671
Hey.

02:33.704 --> 02:35.740
Is somebody there?

02:35.773 --> 02:38.508
Alice? Don't.

02:38.542 --> 02:41.444
Now let's get out of here,
please.

02:54.457 --> 02:56.093
Funny.

02:56.127 --> 02:58.062
Which one of you guys did this?

03:23.020 --> 03:26.791
Oh, my God!
You guys fell for it completely.

03:26.824 --> 03:28.860
You guys are fucking assholes.

03:28.893 --> 03:31.662
Oh, come on, Ros, even you can
admit that was a good one.

03:31.696 --> 03:33.030
Oh, it was totally worth it.

03:33.064 --> 03:34.732
You were in on this, too,
Bethany?

03:34.765 --> 03:36.466
It was Bethany's whole idea.

03:36.499 --> 03:38.169
Well, I mean, Alice came up with
all the good parts.

03:38.202 --> 03:40.071
Well, partially I did, at least.

03:40.104 --> 03:42.673
Hey, so, where did
Kerrie go anyway?

03:59.489 --> 04:01.424
Who's there?

04:41.265 --> 04:44.534
What now, Alice?
Another dumb prank?

04:44.567 --> 04:46.603
No, that wasn't us.

04:46.636 --> 04:49.874
Right. I'm going to bed.

04:49.907 --> 04:53.110
You know what?
I bet you're half right.

04:53.144 --> 04:54.679
Kerrie's screwing with us.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.013
She figured it out,

04:56.047 --> 04:58.481
and now she's just trying
to get back at us.

04:58.515 --> 05:00.084
Come on.

05:04.722 --> 05:07.792
Kerrie? Are you okay in there?

05:16.834 --> 05:18.936
- Oh, my God.
- What?

05:21.706 --> 05:24.507
Oh, my God.
Call... Call an ambulance.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.735
Camille Meadows.

06:26.837 --> 06:30.708
I see you've been at the top
of our wait list for some time.

06:30.741 --> 06:32.276
You'll face a challenge

06:32.309 --> 06:35.346
since our classes
are already underway.

06:35.379 --> 06:37.715
As one of the higher-ranked
academies in the country,

06:37.748 --> 06:39.616
our climate can be
quite competitive,

06:39.649 --> 06:43.154
especially among seniors
like yourself.

06:43.187 --> 06:45.956
Even girls who entered
as freshmen can sometimes

06:45.990 --> 06:49.060
find the stress of their
last semester to be too much.

06:49.093 --> 06:50.294
I've worked very hard to be

06:50.327 --> 06:52.196
where I am right now,
Mrs. Landry.

06:52.229 --> 06:53.931
That's good to hear.

06:53.964 --> 06:55.933
It's fortunate that a space
has opened up for you

06:55.966 --> 06:57.301
here at Edelvine.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.370
Yes.

06:59.403 --> 07:01.772
May I ask what happened?

07:01.806 --> 07:05.776
A girl here died?

07:05.810 --> 07:07.845
That's correct, I'm afraid.

07:07.878 --> 07:09.914
A terrible accident.

07:09.947 --> 07:12.783
Uh, one of our students slipped
and fell from her window.

07:12.817 --> 07:15.086
The poor thing. Tragic.

07:16.954 --> 07:19.156
Well, then, I'll have Helina,
our student aide,

07:19.190 --> 07:20.958
show you to your room.

07:22.927 --> 07:25.229
You sure you don't need
any help?

07:25.262 --> 07:26.797
I got it.

07:26.831 --> 07:28.866
Supper's in the dining hall
at 7:00.

07:28.899 --> 07:30.801
You're gonna want to be on time.

07:30.835 --> 07:32.336
The tables can be
a bit cliquish,

07:32.369 --> 07:34.839
but I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

07:36.140 --> 07:37.408
Curfew's every night by 10:00,

07:37.441 --> 07:38.843
so make sure you're back
in your room,

07:38.876 --> 07:40.411
in case Mrs. Landry
decides to check.

07:40.444 --> 07:42.146
All that's in your
orientation pocket,

07:42.179 --> 07:45.015
but it can be a lot to digest,
especially considering

07:45.049 --> 07:47.852
I'm sure you already have a ton
of catch-up work to do.

07:50.421 --> 07:52.323
This is your room.

08:06.170 --> 08:08.272
The girl who died...

08:10.941 --> 08:12.877
...this was her room?

08:14.345 --> 08:17.882
Yeah. Kerrie Riley.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.683
She lived here.

08:21.719 --> 08:23.387
All the other rooms are full.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.323
But, um, hey, why don't you
come find me

08:26.357 --> 08:29.126
in the study lounge
once you've finished unpacking?

08:29.160 --> 08:31.862
We could go over your
class schedule together.

08:31.896 --> 08:33.998
I'd really appreciate that.

09:00.925 --> 09:02.693
Perfect.

09:47.304 --> 09:50.040
Hey, this is our table.

09:50.074 --> 09:51.475
Scram.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.377
- Your table?
- Uh, yeah.

09:53.410 --> 09:57.147
This is where we sit every day,
not you, whoever you are.

09:57.181 --> 09:59.149
My name's Camille Meadows.
I'm new here.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.819
I didn't ask,
because I don't care.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.321
This is our table,
and everybody knows that.

10:04.355 --> 10:06.924
Move.

10:06.957 --> 10:10.527
- No, I'm good here.
- You're really not.

10:10.561 --> 10:13.230
Look, um, I get that
you're new here,

10:13.264 --> 10:14.865
so you don't know us yet,

10:14.898 --> 10:17.268
but you really don't want
to get on our bad side.

10:17.301 --> 10:18.969
Why's that?

10:19.003 --> 10:20.504
You guys seem so nice.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.940
Um, Camille.

10:22.973 --> 10:24.308
Let's go sit somewhere else.

10:24.341 --> 10:26.343
Oh, Helina's already
made friends

10:26.377 --> 10:28.178
with the retarded new girl.

10:28.212 --> 10:29.913
Why am I not surprised?

10:29.947 --> 10:31.448
Shut up, Yvonne. I'm just...

10:31.482 --> 10:35.119
Hey. What's going on here?

10:35.152 --> 10:37.354
The new girl wants
to sit at our table.

10:37.388 --> 10:38.922
It's true.

10:38.956 --> 10:40.324
It's good conversation.

10:40.357 --> 10:41.992
Sure.

10:42.026 --> 10:44.328
I mean, we do have
an extra chair now, don't we?

10:44.361 --> 10:46.196
And you already took
Kerrie's spot in school,

10:46.230 --> 10:48.532
so you might as well take
her study lounge seat, too.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.267
Thanks, Alice, but it's fine.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.468
We'll just go sit
somewhere else.

10:51.502 --> 10:53.337
So...

10:53.370 --> 10:55.406
What's your name?

10:55.439 --> 10:56.974
Camille.

10:57.007 --> 10:58.442
Well, I'm Alice.

10:58.475 --> 11:01.145
And you've already
met Lenora and Yvonne.

11:01.178 --> 11:03.213
This is Bethany.
And over here...

11:06.950 --> 11:09.186
Oops. Oh, my God.

11:09.219 --> 11:11.322
I am so sorry.

11:11.355 --> 11:14.625
Looks like you're gonna
have to go get changed.

11:14.659 --> 11:17.227
Go on, get the fuck out of here.

11:29.006 --> 11:30.941
Stop!

11:35.045 --> 11:36.547
Stop that immediately!

11:36.580 --> 11:38.349
Ugh!

11:38.382 --> 11:41.518
All of you to my office.
This instant.

11:53.530 --> 11:55.566
Are you certain
you don't want to tell me

11:55.599 --> 11:58.335
who started this fight?

11:58.369 --> 12:02.106
It was just
a little misunderstanding.

12:02.139 --> 12:05.342
I can't say you're off to the
best start here, Ms. Meadows.

12:05.376 --> 12:09.313
I hope you don't make me regret
our decision to enroll you.

12:09.346 --> 12:12.416
Now, unless one of you girls

12:12.449 --> 12:15.352
tells me who was responsible
for this altercation,

12:15.386 --> 12:18.989
I'm afraid I will have no choice
but to punish you all.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.929
Fine, then. You're dismissed.

13:04.702 --> 13:07.971
Tomorrow's a new day.

13:10.407 --> 13:12.677
You fucking joking?

14:14.505 --> 14:17.474
Hi. I got a maintenance
request for this room.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.610
- Just one moment, please.
- That's okay. I'll, uh...

14:29.787 --> 14:31.154
Sorry about that.

14:31.188 --> 14:32.523
No problem.

14:32.556 --> 14:35.793
So, you're the guy around here
who fixes stuff?

14:35.827 --> 14:39.196
Yeah, I guess that's me.

14:39.229 --> 14:43.100
Janitor, handyman, et cetera.

14:43.133 --> 14:46.370
Uh, really just those two.

14:46.403 --> 14:49.473
So, you put a request
in the maintenance box.

14:49.506 --> 14:53.377
Yeah, that light
keeps flickering.

14:53.410 --> 14:56.413
Or at least it was last night.

14:56.446 --> 14:57.682
I'm new here.

14:57.715 --> 14:59.149
Yeah, I heard.

14:59.182 --> 15:01.118
Uh, nice to meet you.
My name's Trevor.

15:01.151 --> 15:02.319
Camille.

15:05.790 --> 15:07.324
Oh.

15:07.357 --> 15:09.727
It must be the ghost again.

15:09.761 --> 15:12.764
No, this building's supposed
to be haunted, you know?

15:12.797 --> 15:15.867
Isn't every old school building
supposed to be haunted?

15:15.900 --> 15:18.635
Yeah, each school probably does
have its own stories,

15:18.670 --> 15:21.438
but this one especially

15:21.471 --> 15:23.675
used to freak me out
when I was a kid.

15:23.708 --> 15:25.442
You grew up around here?

15:25.475 --> 15:28.612
I did. You've undoubtedly met
my mother, Mrs. Landry.

15:28.645 --> 15:30.380
Your mom's the head mistress?

15:30.414 --> 15:32.115
Mm-hmm.

15:32.149 --> 15:35.118
Yeah, she moved here to start
teaching when I was 5.

15:35.152 --> 15:36.620
All my babysitters growing up
were students,

15:36.654 --> 15:40.357
so I know all the best
Edelvine ghost stories.

15:40.390 --> 15:41.893
I, um...

15:41.926 --> 15:44.294
I've got to go to class.

15:44.328 --> 15:46.898
So I'll just let you...

15:46.931 --> 15:49.166
Yeah, no problem.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.301
Is everything else okay?

15:51.335 --> 15:53.705
Um, I think the window
might be loose.

15:53.738 --> 15:56.239
I kind of felt a little draft
last night.

15:56.273 --> 15:58.308
Okay. I'll take a look at it.

15:58.342 --> 16:00.644
Uh, I meant...

16:00.678 --> 16:02.312
Oh, that's just...

16:03.881 --> 16:05.817
- It's just an accident.
- Well, be careful out there.

16:05.850 --> 16:08.151
Let me know if you need
anything else.

16:11.656 --> 16:14.358
In the Noh drama style,
women were barred

16:14.391 --> 16:16.259
from participation onstage.

16:16.293 --> 16:19.162
Their lead roles were acted out
by male performers

16:19.196 --> 16:22.599
wearing masks,
not entirely unlike those

16:22.633 --> 16:25.435
that you each designed
for yourselves.

16:27.504 --> 16:30.574
Camille, I was hoping
you could tell us the name

16:30.607 --> 16:35.345
of the first acknowledged female
performer in English theater.

16:35.379 --> 16:37.147
I'm not sure.

16:40.250 --> 16:45.657
Margaret Hughes, who took
the stage on December 8, 1660.

16:45.690 --> 16:47.557
This was in your reading.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.961
I understand it will take
some time for you to catch up

16:49.994 --> 16:52.429
with the rest of the class,
but it might help

16:52.462 --> 16:56.233
to keep your eyes forward
while I am speaking.

16:56.266 --> 17:00.337
Now, before we finish today,
as you recall, last semester,

17:00.370 --> 17:05.308
you each submitted essays to the
Ivy Gate Fellowship competition.

17:05.342 --> 17:08.746
I am very proud to announce
that one of our own students,

17:08.780 --> 17:11.348
Bethany, has won first place,

17:11.381 --> 17:15.720
with a prize of a $250,000
college scholarship.

17:15.753 --> 17:17.955
- You didn't tell me that.
- Her winning essay will be

17:17.989 --> 17:21.258
featured in the next issue
of the <i>Edelvine Gazette.</i>

17:21.291 --> 17:25.228
And I suggest you all read it
to learn from her example.

17:28.733 --> 17:30.267
Class is dismissed.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.803
As for those of you
with detention,

17:31.836 --> 17:35.372
Mrs. Landry has asked that you
meet her in the library.

17:36.841 --> 17:39.877
In order to make our entire
storage collection

17:39.911 --> 17:43.246
searchable online, a good deal
of archiving and scanning

17:43.280 --> 17:44.882
will have to be done.

17:44.916 --> 17:48.552
And I have decided that you
will all have detention

17:48.585 --> 17:52.023
each and every day until
this project is completed

17:52.056 --> 17:53.925
to my satisfaction.

17:53.958 --> 17:56.393
I know you girls are dealing
with a lot right now,

17:56.426 --> 17:57.929
but we do not tolerate

17:57.962 --> 18:01.431
any physical altercations
here at Edelvine.

18:01.465 --> 18:04.367
If you can all manage
to work together as a team,

18:04.401 --> 18:06.838
I'm sure you'll get through
this quickly.

18:12.677 --> 18:14.779
This is gonna take forever.

18:14.812 --> 18:17.581
- Thanks a bunch, new girl.
- Her name is Camille.

18:17.614 --> 18:19.649
And also, how is
any of this her fault?

18:19.684 --> 18:22.285
- You and Alice started it.
- I shouldn't even be here.

18:22.319 --> 18:24.354
- I didn't do anything.
- Shut up, Bethany.

18:24.387 --> 18:25.957
You just got a quarter-million-
dollar scholarship,

18:25.990 --> 18:28.059
so you can stop freaking out
about your transcript.

18:28.092 --> 18:29.861
Whereas I have
a recital next week

18:29.894 --> 18:31.929
- I should be practicing for.
- Okay, well, you know what?

18:31.963 --> 18:33.664
I think we all should've gotten
a pass this semester

18:33.698 --> 18:35.365
'cause of Kerrie.

18:35.398 --> 18:36.901
Okay, I don't mean to be harsh,

18:36.934 --> 18:38.903
but aren't you supposed
to get an automatic 4.0

18:38.936 --> 18:40.637
if your friend dives
out a window?

18:40.671 --> 18:42.539
I think that's
only if you're roommates.

18:42.572 --> 18:44.809
As much as I'd love
to spend my last semester

18:44.842 --> 18:47.611
listening to our complain,
I suggest we put all our

18:47.644 --> 18:50.014
differences aside for now,

18:50.047 --> 18:53.383
and like Mrs. Landry said,
get to work.

18:53.416 --> 18:55.820
Agreed?

18:55.853 --> 18:59.090
I can start looking
for those books in storage.

18:59.123 --> 19:00.825
If someone shows me
where that is.

19:00.858 --> 19:02.960
Yeah, I'll come with you.

19:04.929 --> 19:09.801
Um, okay, next one is 115.25.

19:15.072 --> 19:17.340
Okay, I'm gonna go
take these up front.

19:17.374 --> 19:19.010
Um, you happy to start
on the next shelf?

19:19.043 --> 19:20.477
Yeah.

19:56.479 --> 19:57.715
Helina?

20:53.871 --> 20:55.206
Wow.

20:55.239 --> 20:57.641
Well, if you can't have fun
in detention,

20:57.675 --> 20:59.542
when can you have fun?

20:59.576 --> 21:00.811
Hilarious.

21:00.845 --> 21:02.113
Yeah, you like?

21:02.146 --> 21:04.181
We made masks of our faces
in theater tech.

21:04.215 --> 21:07.785
I did such a good job.

21:07.818 --> 21:10.154
Can you even tell
I'm wearing it?

21:10.187 --> 21:12.757
Oh.

21:12.790 --> 21:14.659
Oh, hi, Helina.

21:14.692 --> 21:17.460
We were just having fun
with your new girlfriend.

21:17.494 --> 21:19.130
You know, one of these days,
you two are gonna mess

21:19.163 --> 21:21.032
with the wrong person.

21:21.065 --> 21:23.901
Maybe.
Not today, though.

21:23.935 --> 21:27.805
Oh, no.
Are you mad at us, Helina?

21:27.838 --> 21:29.740
Oh! Boo-hoo!

21:37.815 --> 21:39.649
Sorry about them.

21:39.684 --> 21:41.551
I'd say they're better
once you get to know them,

21:41.584 --> 21:43.688
but they're not really.

21:45.756 --> 21:50.493
If anything, they've gotten
worse since, um...

21:50.527 --> 21:52.730
since Kerrie died.

21:52.763 --> 21:55.565
Did you know her well?

21:55.598 --> 21:58.135
Yeah, we used to be close.

21:58.169 --> 22:01.638
My first year here, but, um...

22:01.672 --> 22:04.108
we... we grew apart.

22:04.141 --> 22:06.243
Kerrie started hanging out
with Alice and the others,

22:06.277 --> 22:08.679
and then she just didn't have
time for me anymore.

22:08.713 --> 22:10.114
I'm sorry.

22:10.147 --> 22:12.883
Not your fault.

22:12.917 --> 22:15.119
What happened, exactly?

22:15.152 --> 22:17.188
I'm sorry. No one's told me.

22:17.221 --> 22:20.057
Some people think
it was an accident.

22:20.091 --> 22:21.993
I heard a rumor that
her parents want to reopen

22:22.026 --> 22:24.228
the police investigation.

22:24.261 --> 22:26.596
What do you think?

22:26.629 --> 22:28.666
I think it's easier to believe
almost anything

22:28.699 --> 22:30.201
other than that someone
we were close to

22:30.234 --> 22:32.535
was in pain
and we didn't notice.

22:35.106 --> 22:36.907
So, I-I don't know.

22:38.876 --> 22:42.246
Guess we'll never
really know for sure.

22:42.279 --> 22:45.515
What if I told you
there's a way we can find out?

22:47.151 --> 22:49.687
What are you talking about?

22:49.720 --> 22:52.156
Come, I'll show you.

22:55.826 --> 22:57.094
So, we've been talking
about doing

22:57.128 --> 22:58.996
something like this anyway,

22:59.030 --> 23:02.266
and then Bethany found
this ritual online.

23:02.299 --> 23:03.834
It's in Latin.

23:03.868 --> 23:06.070
So, you're gonna do a seance.

23:06.103 --> 23:07.604
In here.

23:07.637 --> 23:09.140
To contact your friend.

23:09.173 --> 23:11.909
This is really fucked up.

23:11.942 --> 23:13.944
What is your problem, Helina?

23:13.978 --> 23:16.013
If it doesn't work,
it doesn't work.

23:16.047 --> 23:18.816
Worst-case scenario,
nothing happens, right?

23:18.849 --> 23:20.351
And I mean,
don't you want to know

23:20.384 --> 23:22.953
why Kerrie did what she did?

23:22.987 --> 23:24.321
I'm in.

23:24.355 --> 23:26.757
Why not? Sounds weird.

23:26.791 --> 23:30.728
Besides, I'm not working in here
while you all take a break.

23:30.761 --> 23:35.032
Okay, fine. I guess if you're
all really doing this...

23:35.066 --> 23:38.035
Grab a chair, then.

23:38.069 --> 23:42.139
Where's, uh... what's her name?

23:42.173 --> 23:45.276
Oh, Lenora said
she wasn't feeling great,

23:45.309 --> 23:47.912
so we shouldn't wait for her.

23:49.380 --> 23:51.949
There's someone
hiding in that corner.

23:51.982 --> 23:54.718
- How... How did you...
- They're trying to scare us.

23:54.752 --> 23:56.687
Just play it cool.

24:11.802 --> 24:14.004
So, is this what you all do
for fun here?

24:14.038 --> 24:16.807
To be fair,
we don't have a ton of options.

24:16.841 --> 24:20.077
Okay, then. Fine.

24:20.111 --> 24:21.946
How does it work?

24:21.979 --> 24:23.814
Well, first,
you need a planchette,

24:23.848 --> 24:25.015
like a writing tool.

24:25.049 --> 24:27.685
Alice had a great idea for that.

24:30.721 --> 24:32.389
Neat, huh?

24:32.423 --> 24:37.194
Okay, so, we've got to
concentrate our energy

24:37.228 --> 24:41.332
and maintain contact
with the, um, planchette here.

24:41.365 --> 24:43.134
You guys ready?

25:06.924 --> 25:09.059
Is that it?

25:11.195 --> 25:14.832
So, what happens now?

25:14.865 --> 25:17.234
Wait, I guess.

25:17.268 --> 25:18.936
- For how long?
- Wait.

25:18.969 --> 25:21.238
Okay, I...

25:25.276 --> 25:27.011
Who's doing that?

25:31.248 --> 25:33.884
"Me."

25:33.918 --> 25:38.789
Okay. Spirit, is there anything
you want to tell us?

25:44.228 --> 25:45.229
Hold on. This is...

25:45.262 --> 25:47.431
Shh! Ros.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.268
"Ghost is real."

25:51.302 --> 25:53.504
What... What
is it talking about?

25:53.537 --> 25:55.306
Oh, come on.

25:55.339 --> 25:58.742
You didn't seriously think
this would scare us, did you?

25:58.776 --> 26:00.844
Quiet, Helina.
We're not doing this.

26:00.878 --> 26:02.179
This is too weird.

26:02.213 --> 26:05.249
No, wait.
We shouldn't break contact.

26:05.282 --> 26:07.284
Seriously?

26:07.318 --> 26:09.153
Yeah.

26:09.186 --> 26:11.121
We should keep going, right?

26:13.490 --> 26:17.261
Spirit, with whom am I speaking?

26:26.837 --> 26:28.505
Kerrie.

26:28.539 --> 26:30.274
Is it actually her?

26:30.307 --> 26:33.310
- You all really are sick.
- What the fuck is going on?

26:33.344 --> 26:36.847
I can't believe that even you
would sink this low for a joke.

26:44.555 --> 26:47.391
Okay, what... what's
that supposed to mean?

26:47.424 --> 26:50.227
W-Who is going to kill us?

26:53.497 --> 26:55.199
"She is."

26:55.232 --> 26:58.569
W-Who is she, Kerrie?
Who do you mean?

26:58.602 --> 27:01.171
- "Her?"
- She's talking in circles.

27:01.205 --> 27:05.242
Maybe being a ghost
is confusing.

27:05.276 --> 27:07.444
"She is here."

27:28.365 --> 27:30.134
I...

27:37.207 --> 27:39.243
So, what was that in there?

27:39.276 --> 27:41.245
It seems like <i>you</i>
should tell <i>us.</i>

27:41.278 --> 27:43.180
It was supposed to be a joke.

27:43.213 --> 27:44.948
We were gonna move
the planchette around,

27:44.982 --> 27:46.383
draw a pentagram
with the lipstick,

27:46.417 --> 27:48.385
and then Lenora was gonna
jump out and scare you.

27:48.419 --> 27:50.487
Would have been really funny.

27:50.521 --> 27:52.389
Yeah, it would have.

27:52.423 --> 27:54.591
But that wasn't us.

27:54.625 --> 27:56.260
I honestly figured it was
one of you two

27:56.293 --> 27:57.528
who was doing it at first.

27:57.561 --> 27:59.096
What, you really expect me
to believe

27:59.129 --> 28:01.298
that we just talked
to Kerrie's spirit?

28:01.332 --> 28:02.499
I don't know.

28:02.533 --> 28:04.902
I really did read
that incantation.

28:04.935 --> 28:07.271
On the site where I got
the ritual, it said that

28:07.304 --> 28:09.173
you could only contact
the spirits of people

28:09.206 --> 28:10.574
who died somewhere nearby.

28:10.607 --> 28:13.077
We really did
the summoning, too.

28:15.612 --> 28:19.083
The Edelvine ghost,
that night with Kerrie...

28:19.116 --> 28:21.552
we said the words
at the right time.

28:23.420 --> 28:25.923
The Edelvine ghost?

28:25.956 --> 28:27.991
It's just an old legend.

28:28.025 --> 28:31.462
Some girl supposedly killed
herself in the dorms years ago.

28:31.495 --> 28:34.398
Story goes, if you call to her,
she appears, and then...

28:34.431 --> 28:36.600
- Then you die.
- Yeah, but it's not real.

28:36.633 --> 28:40.037
And, I mean, no one's stupid
enough to actually try it.

28:42.306 --> 28:43.540
Oh.

28:46.176 --> 28:50.013
The night Kerrie died, it really
was supposed to be a joke.

28:51.115 --> 28:52.616
Then she ran to her room,

28:52.649 --> 28:55.986
and that was the last time
any of us saw her alive.

28:58.288 --> 29:01.492
Hey, so, I honestly couldn't
hear or see anything

29:01.525 --> 29:02.926
from over in the corner.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.962
Can somebody tell me
what happened?

29:11.368 --> 29:12.670
Are you okay?

29:12.704 --> 29:15.072
I guess.

29:15.105 --> 29:18.676
I mean, that had to just be
an awful fucking joke, right?

29:18.710 --> 29:20.344
Maybe.

29:20.377 --> 29:22.079
They seemed pretty sincere.

29:22.112 --> 29:24.682
Yeah, they're good at that.

29:24.716 --> 29:27.651
It's the same joke they played
the night that Kerrie died?

29:29.754 --> 29:32.556
I just know I don't
trust any of them.

29:38.730 --> 29:41.098
No idea how I meet these guys.

29:41.131 --> 29:43.500
Last guy who messaged me just
wanted pictures of my feet.

29:43.534 --> 29:46.203
Uh, I'll just
catch up with you guys in a bit.

29:46.236 --> 29:47.571
- Okay?
- Are you sure?

29:47.604 --> 29:49.373
Yeah, it's cool.

30:29.179 --> 30:30.748
What the...?

30:33.183 --> 30:35.118
Is somebody there?

30:36.788 --> 30:38.656
Okay, come on, if this is
somebody playing a joke,

30:38.690 --> 30:40.624
it's really not funny.

30:42.459 --> 30:43.728
Fuck...

32:14.251 --> 32:16.186
Camille?

32:18.322 --> 32:21.124
Um, yeah? Come in.

32:24.595 --> 32:27.164
Hey, um, I printed

32:27.197 --> 32:28.866
those Renaissance notes
I was telling you about.

32:28.900 --> 32:31.468
Oh, thank you.

32:31.501 --> 32:34.471
That's really...

32:34.504 --> 32:36.874
super helpful.

32:36.908 --> 32:38.776
Thanks.

32:38.810 --> 32:40.410
Helina?

32:42.412 --> 32:43.915
Do you mind me asking,

32:43.948 --> 32:47.317
the girl who lived here,
Kerrie...

32:47.351 --> 32:49.386
what was she like?

32:49.419 --> 32:51.789
Are you worried your room
is haunted now?

32:51.823 --> 32:54.224
I don't know.

32:55.693 --> 32:58.595
My grandmother used to say
that if someone dies

32:58.629 --> 33:05.235
in a really horrible,
like, bad way,

33:05.268 --> 33:08.171
the energy imprints
on the surroundings.

33:08.205 --> 33:10.574
And if you're sensitive,
you can pick up on it,

33:10.607 --> 33:13.678
like playing back a recording.

33:13.711 --> 33:18.750
Look, even if Kerrie was here
in some way, she...

33:23.286 --> 33:25.222
Kerrie was a good person.

33:26.691 --> 33:27.925
Okay.

33:30.260 --> 33:31.663
Thanks.

33:41.739 --> 33:44.241
And a tendu, close.

33:44.274 --> 33:46.343
Shape the arm, and in.

33:46.376 --> 33:50.715
Dégagé, dégagé, piqué,
and close.

33:50.748 --> 33:52.950
Pas de cheval, and in.

33:52.984 --> 33:55.318
And side, and in.

33:55.352 --> 33:57.521
And back, and in.

33:57.554 --> 33:59.757
And seven, and eight.

33:59.791 --> 34:01.926
And a-one, and a-two.

34:01.959 --> 34:03.728
Balancé, and four.

34:04.962 --> 34:08.398
And five and six,
and developpé.

34:08.432 --> 34:10.802
Chassé, grand jeté.

34:10.835 --> 34:13.570
Yes?

34:13.603 --> 34:16.339
What?

34:16.373 --> 34:18.575
No.

34:18.608 --> 34:21.244
No, she isn't.

34:21.278 --> 34:22.512
Hm.

34:25.817 --> 34:29.319
That's all for today.
Good work, everyone.

34:29.352 --> 34:32.757
Alice, Bethany, Yvonne,
Rosalind, Camille...

34:32.790 --> 34:36.894
after you've changed,
please come see me in my office.

34:36.928 --> 34:39.897
Camille, just one moment,
please.

34:43.835 --> 34:46.671
Your transcripts say you
undertook ballet at Brighton.

34:46.704 --> 34:48.039
Is that accurate?

34:48.072 --> 34:49.606
Of course.

34:49.639 --> 34:51.341
Huh.

34:51.374 --> 34:56.047
I'm sorry. I... I didn't sleep
very well last night.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.315
And I have cramps.

34:58.348 --> 35:00.383
Ah.

35:00.417 --> 35:02.854
I truly hope to see some
improvement from you shortly.

35:02.887 --> 35:04.756
Now go get dressed
with your friends.

35:04.789 --> 35:07.257
They're not my friends.

35:15.465 --> 35:19.503
So, you're telling me that none
of you have seen or heard

35:19.536 --> 35:21.906
from Lenora since supper
last evening?

35:21.939 --> 35:24.608
No, she wasn't at lunch
or in class.

35:24.641 --> 35:26.343
And she didn't say anything
about perhaps

35:26.376 --> 35:28.478
traveling somewhere,
anything like that?

35:28.512 --> 35:31.916
I've been texting her all day,
but I think her phone is off.

35:31.949 --> 35:33.483
And I went to her room
before lunch,

35:33.517 --> 35:35.352
but her door's locked.

35:35.385 --> 35:37.722
Yes, a staff member checked
Lenora's room this morning

35:37.755 --> 35:39.957
when she wasn't in class.

35:39.991 --> 35:43.493
Almost all of her personal items
are missing.

35:43.527 --> 35:45.629
We've spoken with her parents.

35:45.663 --> 35:47.364
They're trying to locate
a young man

35:47.397 --> 35:49.599
she's become acquainted with
online.

35:49.633 --> 35:53.037
Wait, you think
Lenora ran away from school?

35:53.070 --> 35:54.939
She would never do that,
Mrs. Landry.

35:54.972 --> 35:57.775
I mean, definitely not
without telling us.

35:57.809 --> 36:01.545
Which is exactly why
I've invited you all here.

36:01.578 --> 36:04.514
I can assure you that
any information given to me

36:04.548 --> 36:07.084
will be passed along
in confidence.

36:07.118 --> 36:09.754
Her parents just want
to know she's okay.

36:09.787 --> 36:12.056
- So do we.
- Yeah. This doesn't even...

36:12.089 --> 36:15.726
Mrs. Landry, we honestly
don't know anything.

36:15.760 --> 36:18.830
But I don't think Lenora
would just take off like that.

36:18.863 --> 36:21.766
I can see that
we're getting nowhere.

36:21.799 --> 36:25.468
But please, if any of you girls
should suddenly recall

36:25.502 --> 36:28.039
anything at all
regarding this matter,

36:28.072 --> 36:30.074
please let me know.

36:30.107 --> 36:31.876
You're dismissed.

36:38.582 --> 36:40.785
Why are old people so stupid?

36:40.818 --> 36:42.653
Your brain cells die
after you turn 30.

36:42.687 --> 36:43.921
I read that.

36:43.955 --> 36:45.823
There's no way
Lenora just bailed on us.

36:45.857 --> 36:47.758
Mrs. Landry said all her stuff
was packed and gone.

36:47.792 --> 36:49.994
That's just not possible.

36:50.027 --> 36:52.163
Mrs. Landry's son, Trevor,

36:52.196 --> 36:54.832
he's like the handyman
around here, right?

36:54.866 --> 36:56.901
Would he have a key to her room?

36:56.934 --> 36:58.703
I guess so.

37:01.005 --> 37:02.539
What are you doing?

37:02.572 --> 37:03.975
Texting him.

37:04.008 --> 37:06.010
How do you have his number?

37:06.043 --> 37:08.946
- He gave it to me.
- Well, that's just impossible.

37:08.980 --> 37:12.449
Because he doesn't talk
to us students, like, ever.

37:13.684 --> 37:15.019
Great.

37:15.052 --> 37:17.454
He's gonna meet me in the dorm.

37:17.487 --> 37:18.990
What's got you playing
detective?

37:19.023 --> 37:20.523
You don't even know Lenora.

37:20.557 --> 37:22.126
Why do you care
what's happened to her?

37:22.159 --> 37:26.563
I don't. But whatever it is,
I don't want it to happen to me.

37:26.596 --> 37:29.633
Come with us. Or don't.
Up to you.

37:51.923 --> 37:53.691
So, when you said
you wanted me to meet you here,

37:53.724 --> 37:56.794
that was kind of like
a plural "you," huh?

37:56.827 --> 37:59.664
Sorry. It's important.

37:59.697 --> 38:01.198
Well, it better be.

38:01.232 --> 38:02.934
Could get in trouble for this,
you know?

38:02.967 --> 38:06.804
We won't tell anyone.
We just want to see in her room.

38:25.022 --> 38:28.125
Her suitcase is gone.

38:28.159 --> 38:31.561
Yeah, I assume that's the kind
of clue they'd look for.

38:31.594 --> 38:33.030
Seems like she packed
in a hurry.

38:33.064 --> 38:34.865
Her room's always
kind of like this.

38:34.899 --> 38:36.934
There's a hidden space
behind the top drawer,

38:36.968 --> 38:38.501
in case you get a room search.

38:38.535 --> 38:39.870
You didn't see this.

38:39.904 --> 38:41.571
I'm not even here.

38:41.604 --> 38:44.675
I don't think she would leave
without this, would she?

38:44.709 --> 38:46.811
Can I see that?

38:49.680 --> 38:51.182
Well, we should probably
get out of here,

38:51.215 --> 38:54.285
so if you're all finished...

38:54.318 --> 38:56.087
Yeah, I guess.

39:00.291 --> 39:02.760
Lenora made her bed?

39:11.202 --> 39:13.237
The police are on their way.

39:13.270 --> 39:15.139
They've told me that
they'll have the substance

39:15.172 --> 39:17.274
on Lenora's bed analyzed
to determine if there's

39:17.308 --> 39:18.943
any cause for real concern.

39:18.976 --> 39:20.177
Cause for real concern?

39:20.211 --> 39:22.113
Mrs. Landry,
our friend's disappeared,

39:22.146 --> 39:24.315
and there's a cross
drawn in blood on her bed.

39:24.348 --> 39:27.051
As I said, Bethany,
the police are on their way,

39:27.084 --> 39:30.154
and I'm sure they'll take this
quite seriously.

39:30.187 --> 39:33.290
I, for one, just hope this isn't
a waste of their time.

39:33.324 --> 39:35.893
To me, this appears to be
exactly the sort of prank

39:35.926 --> 39:37.560
Lenora and you girls
love to play.

39:37.594 --> 39:39.864
- We wouldn't...
- We shall see.

39:41.966 --> 39:45.202
As for you, Trevor,
we'll discuss this matter later.

39:45.236 --> 39:47.171
Wait for me at home.

39:49.940 --> 39:51.942
Whatever's going on here,

39:51.976 --> 39:53.978
I'm sure there's no need
to impress upon you

39:54.011 --> 39:57.081
how bad it would be
for rumors to circulate.

39:57.114 --> 39:59.350
If I hear any gossip
regarding this matter,

39:59.383 --> 40:01.952
I will know its source.

40:01.986 --> 40:03.586
The police will be here shortly,

40:03.620 --> 40:05.122
and I will apprise
you of their findings,

40:05.156 --> 40:09.360
but if this turns out to be
one of your jokes...

40:09.393 --> 40:13.230
To that point, shouldn't you all
currently be in detention?

40:24.275 --> 40:25.976
This is it.

40:26.010 --> 40:27.945
I think I found her.

40:29.947 --> 40:32.883
Alicia Kane, daughter of
Noah and Ethel Kane.

40:32.917 --> 40:36.253
Born February 24, 1982,
Gridley, Illinois.

40:36.287 --> 40:40.758
Died October 13, 1998,
at Edelvine Girls Academy.

40:40.791 --> 40:42.827
Funeral service will be held...

40:42.860 --> 40:44.195
Is that it?

40:44.228 --> 40:46.097
They won't say suicide
in obituaries.

40:46.130 --> 40:48.699
I wouldn't expect
any more details.

40:48.732 --> 40:50.234
How do we know it's her?

40:50.267 --> 40:51.769
We don't.

40:51.802 --> 40:53.671
But, um, I did
an obituary search online,

40:53.704 --> 40:55.206
and this was the only listing
I could find

40:55.239 --> 40:57.808
for a student who died here
at Edelvine.

40:57.842 --> 41:01.245
I mean, aside from Kerrie.

41:04.148 --> 41:05.950
1998, right?

41:16.760 --> 41:22.666
- So, that's the Edelvine ghost?
- Wait, look at her necklace.

41:23.701 --> 41:26.403
It's the same cross.

41:26.437 --> 41:30.640
That's her, but...
now what do we do?

41:45.723 --> 41:48.692
Better hurry, Ros. Past 10:00.

42:56.327 --> 42:58.963
Hey, someone's still in here!

43:02.132 --> 43:04.068
Assholes.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.569
Shit.

45:50.702 --> 45:55.172
Excuse me, please, everyone.

45:55.205 --> 46:00.611
As some of you may have heard,
I have tragic news.

46:00.644 --> 46:03.681
One of your classmates,
Rosalind Carlisle,

46:03.715 --> 46:06.283
passed away tonight.

46:06.316 --> 46:09.319
I've just spoken to the coroner,
and it would seem

46:09.353 --> 46:12.956
that she somehow fell
in the shower.

46:12.990 --> 46:17.161
For now, I'll ask you all
to please return to your rooms.

46:46.223 --> 46:49.026
Hey, Camille,
are you in there?

46:54.766 --> 46:59.069
Hey, um, I-I just heard
the awful news about Rosalind,

46:59.102 --> 47:01.472
and I wanted to, um...

47:01.505 --> 47:03.540
j-just check and make sure
you're okay.

47:03.574 --> 47:05.609
Thanks.

47:05.642 --> 47:07.511
Yeah, I'll be fine.

47:07.544 --> 47:09.747
Are you sure?

47:09.781 --> 47:14.084
I... I have some Xanax,
if you need anything.

47:14.117 --> 47:17.054
I-I've just been taking them
to sleep since...

47:17.087 --> 47:19.623
Lately.

47:19.657 --> 47:22.259
No. Thanks.

47:22.292 --> 47:25.663
Okay. Um...

47:25.697 --> 47:27.732
Good night, then.

47:27.765 --> 47:32.469
Hey, um, do you want
to hang out here for a while?

47:52.724 --> 47:54.659
Rosalind.

47:57.394 --> 48:00.798
It doesn't make any sense.

48:00.832 --> 48:03.500
How so?

48:03.534 --> 48:06.637
For her to fall in the shower.

48:06.671 --> 48:08.539
I mean, I know
stuff like that happens,

48:08.572 --> 48:13.277
but, like, only
to really old people, right?

48:23.153 --> 48:25.757
Maybe I do believe in ghosts.

48:28.191 --> 48:32.262
There have been times in here
when I felt like someone

48:32.296 --> 48:35.532
was watching me,
but there was no one there.

48:35.566 --> 48:37.501
You know?

48:38.836 --> 48:41.104
You're kind of freaking me out.

48:41.138 --> 48:44.709
Sorry.

48:44.742 --> 48:46.510
Me too.

48:47.845 --> 48:50.147
I think I'm pretty high.

48:54.251 --> 48:56.186
Hang on.

48:58.455 --> 49:02.225
I want to give you something.

49:02.259 --> 49:04.561
Camille, you didn't have to.

49:08.833 --> 49:12.169
Okay. What is it?

49:19.576 --> 49:21.511
Keep it.

49:22.714 --> 49:27.584
If anything scares you,
hit it in the skull.

49:27.618 --> 49:30.454
Don't you need it?

49:30.487 --> 49:32.589
No, I've got other stuff.

49:34.859 --> 49:36.627
Okay. Um...

49:41.598 --> 49:43.701
Thank you, Camille.

49:51.809 --> 49:54.211
No, Mom, I'm fine.

49:54.244 --> 49:55.947
I'm just...

49:55.980 --> 49:58.615
We're all just really upset.

49:59.884 --> 50:01.919
Ros was...

50:01.953 --> 50:05.255
No, no, I don't... I don't
need you and Dad to come here.

50:05.288 --> 50:07.792
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

50:07.825 --> 50:10.227
No, it won't affect my grades.

50:11.628 --> 50:14.598
I'll study, Mom, I promise.
Yes.

50:18.635 --> 50:21.773
I need to go to bed now, okay?
I'm really tired.

50:23.473 --> 50:25.242
You too.

50:25.275 --> 50:27.712
Okay, good night, Mom.

50:31.783 --> 50:33.885
Good night, Mr. Bear.

50:52.302 --> 50:54.237
Wait, what?

50:57.742 --> 51:00.210
She was in my room.

51:02.412 --> 51:04.281
Check the closet.

51:04.314 --> 51:06.583
O-Okay.

51:18.328 --> 51:20.698
What's going on in here?

51:20.732 --> 51:23.500
We don't know.
We just got here.

51:23.533 --> 51:25.402
She... She was right over there.

51:25.435 --> 51:27.905
Tell me exactly
what happened, Bethany.

51:27.939 --> 51:31.008
I... I heard a voice in my room,

51:31.042 --> 51:34.411
and it was the Edelvine ghost
looking right at me.

51:34.444 --> 51:35.847
And I threw my lamp at her...

51:35.880 --> 51:38.816
The Edelvine ghost.
Not that nonsense again.

51:38.850 --> 51:41.418
Think logically, Bethany.

51:41.451 --> 51:43.755
Where were you
when you saw this ghost?

51:43.788 --> 51:45.489
You were asleep in bed.

51:45.522 --> 51:47.658
I wasn't asleep.
I'd just turned out the light.

51:47.692 --> 51:52.395
Bethany, you've had a bad dream.

51:52.429 --> 51:55.666
It's entirely understandable
under the circumstances.

51:55.700 --> 51:57.869
I-I was wide awake. I swear.

51:57.902 --> 51:59.636
Everyone return to your rooms.

51:59.670 --> 52:01.304
I know this has been
a terrible evening,

52:01.338 --> 52:02.673
but you need to get some rest.

52:02.707 --> 52:05.442
You can stay in my room tonight,
Bethany.

52:05.475 --> 52:07.477
That's okay, right, Mrs. Landry?

52:07.511 --> 52:10.681
Yes, fine. Just for tonight.

52:10.715 --> 52:14.484
Helina, what are you doing
on this hall after curfew?

52:14.518 --> 52:17.822
I-I was just making sure
that Camille was okay.

52:17.855 --> 52:19.957
What are <i>you</i> doing here,
Mrs. Landry?

52:19.991 --> 52:23.928
Rosalind's mother asked me
to pack up some of her things.

52:23.961 --> 52:25.663
Her family will be here
tomorrow,

52:25.696 --> 52:27.765
and I've offered to help.

52:27.799 --> 52:30.001
Now, all of you,
back to your rooms.

52:30.034 --> 52:32.837
I just need to pack a bag,
Yvonne.

52:43.613 --> 52:45.817
I really think we need to tell
someone what's going on.

52:45.850 --> 52:49.954
Tell them what? That we conjured
a ghost and now it's killing us?

52:49.987 --> 52:51.689
No one will believe it.

52:51.722 --> 52:53.758
Well, I'm not sure <i>I</i> believe it.

52:53.791 --> 52:56.526
Whatever was in Bethany's room,
she scared it off.

52:56.560 --> 53:00.497
I just... don't understand that.

53:00.530 --> 53:04.367
I guess it's difficult to say
why ghosts do what they do.

53:06.838 --> 53:08.940
Are you two high?

53:11.809 --> 53:15.412
Where's Alice?
I haven't seen her tonight.

53:15.445 --> 53:19.016
I don't know. I guess
she slept through everything.

53:19.050 --> 53:21.752
Um, we shouldn't
wake her up now.

53:21.786 --> 53:23.486
I'll tell her in the morning.

53:23.520 --> 53:25.522
Okay.

53:25.555 --> 53:27.591
Be careful.

53:27.624 --> 53:29.727
You too, I guess.

54:05.129 --> 54:07.798
Great, you're finally here.

54:09.599 --> 54:11.802
We're gonna try
and contact Rosalind.

54:11.836 --> 54:13.536
What, right now?

54:13.570 --> 54:16.207
We should do it when
her spirit might be near.

54:16.240 --> 54:19.110
She could have a message for us.

54:19.143 --> 54:21.779
If you don't want to, fine.

54:33.490 --> 54:37.995
Okay, so should we should all
focus our thoughts on Rosalind.

54:49.774 --> 54:52.043
Fuck off.

55:16.100 --> 55:19.070
Rosalind? Is that you?

55:27.178 --> 55:29.646
Do you have a question for her?

55:34.551 --> 55:37.054
Rosalind, hey.

55:38.689 --> 55:40.891
We miss you.

55:40.925 --> 55:43.728
Rosalind, how did you die?

55:43.761 --> 55:45.863
What happened?

55:51.302 --> 55:53.070
"Murder."

55:57.074 --> 56:00.177
Did the Edelvine ghost kill you?

56:05.750 --> 56:07.685
What does she mean?

56:09.687 --> 56:12.757
Rosalind, who killed you?

56:12.790 --> 56:14.291
Was it...

56:20.931 --> 56:23.300
Camille?

56:23.334 --> 56:25.568
What the fuck?

56:25.602 --> 56:28.272
This is fucking bullshit.

56:28.305 --> 56:31.709
One of you is doing
something to...

56:33.811 --> 56:35.246
Camille!

56:35.279 --> 56:38.716
Wait. Wait! Maybe Ros was saying
something else!

56:38.749 --> 56:41.819
Seemed pretty fucking clear.

56:41.852 --> 56:43.721
Are you fucking nuts?

56:43.754 --> 56:46.791
Stay away from me.
Get the fuck away from us.

56:46.824 --> 56:48.926
- We should tell someone.
- Tell them what?

56:48.959 --> 56:50.661
Look, I'm sorry, Camille.

56:50.694 --> 56:51.929
I admit, I don't know
what's going on here.

56:51.962 --> 56:53.664
And if I'm wrong,
then I'll apologize.

56:53.697 --> 56:55.332
But in the meantime,
I'm texting my friend back home

56:55.366 --> 56:57.600
and I'm telling her that
if anything bad happens to me,

56:57.634 --> 56:58.903
Camille Meadows did it.

56:58.936 --> 57:01.038
Yeah, good idea.
I'm gonna text my brother.

57:01.072 --> 57:04.842
Text the FBI for all I care.
I didn't touch Rosalind.

57:04.875 --> 57:06.043
Why would I kill her?

57:06.077 --> 57:07.610
You got into a fight with her.

57:07.644 --> 57:09.914
I got into a fight with <i>you.</i>

57:09.947 --> 57:11.682
Is that a threat?

57:16.887 --> 57:19.256
You should text someone,
too, Yvonne.

57:19.290 --> 57:22.026
Maybe we should call the police,
leave an anonymous tip.

57:22.059 --> 57:25.129
That way, we don't have to
explain, just in case.

57:25.162 --> 57:27.965
Yeah, that's a good idea.

57:29.400 --> 57:31.335
W-Where are you going?

57:31.368 --> 57:33.938
- I need to go to practice.
- Right now?

57:33.971 --> 57:38.275
Yeah, I-I just want to think
about some things.

57:38.309 --> 57:40.610
I'll catch up
with you guys later.

59:36.493 --> 59:38.262
Who's in here?

1:00:16.433 --> 1:00:18.902
You?

1:00:19.169 --> 1:00:21.505
Go away.

1:00:22.840 --> 1:00:25.809
You're not supposed to be
here anymore.

1:00:27.044 --> 1:00:29.947
You're not alive.

1:00:44.528 --> 1:00:47.498
You're not supposed to be here.

1:00:56.907 --> 1:00:58.575
My room is definitely haunted.

1:00:58.609 --> 1:01:01.178
Can I sleep with you tonight?

1:01:01.211 --> 1:01:03.314
Um, yeah, sure.

1:01:17.494 --> 1:01:18.862
Thanks.

1:01:18.896 --> 1:01:22.066
Yeah. No problem.

1:01:22.099 --> 1:01:25.602
I took a couple pills, so I'm
probably gonna pass out soon.

1:01:25.636 --> 1:01:27.404
Cool?

1:02:31.568 --> 1:02:34.204
What?
What the fuck, Yvonne?

1:04:22.079 --> 1:04:23.647
Yvonne?

1:04:25.349 --> 1:04:27.785
Where the hell are you?

1:04:33.223 --> 1:04:35.158
Lenora?

1:04:46.503 --> 1:04:48.272
What the...?

1:05:04.454 --> 1:05:06.557
Yvonne, what the fuck?

1:06:52.629 --> 1:06:54.732
She'll scream.

1:06:57.334 --> 1:06:59.871
No one can hear us
back here.

1:07:01.605 --> 1:07:03.373
Scream all you want.

1:07:07.444 --> 1:07:09.546
Fine. Suit yourself.

1:07:11.983 --> 1:07:15.585
There's not much need
for masks anymore.

1:07:15.619 --> 1:07:17.354
I like wearing it.

1:07:17.387 --> 1:07:19.556
You two...

1:07:19.589 --> 1:07:21.959
killed Kerrie?

1:07:21.993 --> 1:07:24.327
Kerrie?

1:07:24.361 --> 1:07:26.263
Yeah.

1:07:26.296 --> 1:07:28.432
Yeah, and Rosalind.

1:07:30.367 --> 1:07:32.269
And Yvonne.

1:07:32.302 --> 1:07:33.403
And Lenora.

1:07:33.437 --> 1:07:34.604
Fuck this.

1:07:40.644 --> 1:07:42.579
Oh, yeah. She's dead, too.

1:07:42.612 --> 1:07:44.982
Technically, uh,
I killed them.

1:07:45.016 --> 1:07:46.884
I-It's true.

1:07:46.918 --> 1:07:50.454
Kerrie?
Are you okay in there?

1:07:50.487 --> 1:07:53.725
Trevor knows how to make
crawl spaces in these buildings.

1:07:54.992 --> 1:07:57.829
He's been at it for years.

1:07:57.862 --> 1:07:59.797
Oh, my God.

1:08:05.402 --> 1:08:09.006
Oh, my God.
Call an... call an ambulance!

1:08:14.011 --> 1:08:16.313
Why?

1:08:18.548 --> 1:08:21.052
Did you hate them all that much?

1:08:21.085 --> 1:08:23.855
Yes, I did.

1:08:23.888 --> 1:08:28.693
But no, I only did it
because I had to.

1:08:28.726 --> 1:08:31.863
I honestly never expected
that scholarship essay to win.

1:08:31.896 --> 1:08:34.766
I didn't have time
to write my own,

1:08:34.799 --> 1:08:38.401
so I just copied one of Kerrie's
depressing stories,

1:08:38.435 --> 1:08:40.772
just retyped it.

1:08:40.805 --> 1:08:44.374
When I found out it actually
won, I thought I was fucked.

1:08:44.407 --> 1:08:46.677
Not only would I lose
the scholarship,

1:08:46.711 --> 1:08:49.479
but I'd be expelled
for plagiarism.

1:08:49.513 --> 1:08:51.883
My whole life gone.

1:08:51.916 --> 1:08:53.684
Unless...

1:08:55.953 --> 1:08:58.856
The problem was,
once Kerrie was dead,

1:08:58.890 --> 1:09:00.792
I realized I had to kill
the others, too,

1:09:00.825 --> 1:09:02.994
because if they
actually bothered to read it

1:09:03.027 --> 1:09:06.429
once it was published,
they'd know it was Kerrie's.

1:09:06.463 --> 1:09:08.398
They could put it all together.

1:09:08.431 --> 1:09:10.802
So I just had to keep them
distracted.

1:09:10.835 --> 1:09:13.738
Enter the Edelvine ghost.

1:09:13.771 --> 1:09:16.339
The funny thing about
those pranks we used to play

1:09:16.373 --> 1:09:19.110
is that the girls were actually
very superstitious.

1:09:19.143 --> 1:09:20.912
So I moved the planchette.

1:09:20.945 --> 1:09:24.048
I put a magnet in my phone case
for the big stuff.

1:09:24.081 --> 1:09:27.584
And if I had been caught,
I would have laughed it off.

1:09:27.617 --> 1:09:29.352
But no one did.

1:09:29.386 --> 1:09:32.056
And after that, no one was
thinking clearly about anything.

1:09:32.089 --> 1:09:35.092
Trevor had already helped me
there before we even met.

1:09:35.126 --> 1:09:38.129
Didn't you, babe?

1:09:38.162 --> 1:09:40.131
Alicia Kane.

1:09:40.164 --> 1:09:42.900
She used to babysit me
when I was a kid.

1:09:42.934 --> 1:09:45.670
She was a real bitch.

1:09:45.703 --> 1:09:50.540
When I was 12, I snuck
into her room just to scare her.

1:09:50.574 --> 1:09:54.011
She really freaked out.

1:09:54.045 --> 1:09:56.948
So I hit her with my hammer.

1:09:56.981 --> 1:09:59.784
Then it wasn't too hard
to drag her to the bathroom,

1:09:59.817 --> 1:10:02.119
cut her wrists.

1:10:02.153 --> 1:10:06.057
I think my mom might've guessed.

1:10:06.090 --> 1:10:09.160
I've been more careful
since then.

1:10:33.050 --> 1:10:34.986
It was just a dream.

1:10:53.704 --> 1:10:55.206
When we found that
picture of her wearing

1:10:55.239 --> 1:10:57.975
that necklace,
Trevor had the idea

1:10:58.009 --> 1:11:00.577
to put the blood
on Lenora's bed.

1:11:00.610 --> 1:11:03.214
Not many girls would appreciate

1:11:03.247 --> 1:11:06.717
someone with a unique mentality
like Trevor.

1:11:08.252 --> 1:11:12.056
We've had to keep our love
secret since my freshman year.

1:11:12.089 --> 1:11:14.591
But not much longer.

1:11:14.624 --> 1:11:17.695
Freshman year?

1:11:17.728 --> 1:11:19.730
So you were 14.

1:11:19.764 --> 1:11:20.932
Gross.

1:11:20.965 --> 1:11:22.499
Can I kill her now?

1:11:22.532 --> 1:11:24.467
Not just yet.

1:11:42.753 --> 1:11:45.555
It's for the medical examiner.

1:11:45.588 --> 1:11:48.726
While I'm here,
I might as well take this.

1:11:54.265 --> 1:11:57.702
Do you think I didn't see
your shoulders moving?

1:11:57.735 --> 1:12:01.538
Come on, it's amateur hour.

1:12:01.571 --> 1:12:04.709
Use this to kill Alice.
More evidence.

1:12:08.946 --> 1:12:11.849
God must truly be on my side.

1:12:11.882 --> 1:12:13.650
Right when I was trying
to figure out how I was gonna

1:12:13.684 --> 1:12:16.053
pull this off,
the weird new girl shows up,

1:12:16.087 --> 1:12:18.990
picks a fight publicly
with all the victims.

1:12:19.023 --> 1:12:21.859
With Alice and Yvonne's
text messages about you,

1:12:21.892 --> 1:12:24.261
plus the evidence
we'll plant in your room,

1:12:24.295 --> 1:12:26.030
I don't think the police
are gonna look

1:12:26.063 --> 1:12:28.565
too closely at this.

1:12:28.598 --> 1:12:31.869
I mean, Helina might not buy it.

1:12:31.902 --> 1:12:34.105
But when she commits suicide
in a day or two,

1:12:34.138 --> 1:12:35.740
everyone will understand.

1:12:35.773 --> 1:12:37.274
It's just more tragedy.

1:12:37.308 --> 1:12:39.176
If you touch Helina...

1:12:39.210 --> 1:12:40.945
You'll what?

1:12:40.978 --> 1:12:42.747
Be dead?

1:12:45.683 --> 1:12:47.550
This has been
tremendously satisfying,

1:12:47.584 --> 1:12:49.552
but it's time to wrap it up.

1:12:49.586 --> 1:12:52.189
Go ahead, babe. Alice first.

1:13:01.065 --> 1:13:02.233
What?

1:13:02.266 --> 1:13:04.835
Oh, you're so fucked.

1:13:04.869 --> 1:13:07.637
Hey, since you decided to frame
me for a series of murders,

1:13:07.671 --> 1:13:10.174
did you bother
to look me up at all?

1:13:10.207 --> 1:13:11.809
I did.

1:13:11.842 --> 1:13:14.011
And you're not on social media,
which is weird...

1:13:14.045 --> 1:13:17.948
But I bet you did find a
Camille Meadows, though, right?

1:13:17.982 --> 1:13:20.351
Lives in Florida,
gets good grades.

1:13:20.384 --> 1:13:23.054
Went to Brighton for ballet.

1:13:23.087 --> 1:13:25.990
You're not you.

1:13:26.023 --> 1:13:28.225
Hey, I'm a little lost here.
Can somebody loop me in?

1:13:28.259 --> 1:13:32.263
I don't get it. Why?

1:13:32.296 --> 1:13:35.733
I came to this school...

1:13:35.766 --> 1:13:38.302
to pay off a debt.

1:13:38.335 --> 1:13:39.970
And how's that going?

1:13:43.374 --> 1:13:45.843
Could be worse.

1:13:45.876 --> 1:13:47.044
Where's the breaker?

1:13:47.078 --> 1:13:48.679
By the back door.

1:13:48.712 --> 1:13:50.114
Stay here.

1:13:57.421 --> 1:13:59.356
Hey, Trevor.

1:14:00.958 --> 1:14:03.994
Last chance.

1:14:04.028 --> 1:14:07.965
Untie me, and maybe you can go
to hospital instead of prison.

1:14:07.998 --> 1:14:11.669
Yeah, you know, my mother
sent me to therapy a few times.

1:14:11.702 --> 1:14:13.671
I always got along fine
with the therapists.

1:14:13.704 --> 1:14:16.006
Good listeners.

1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:17.842
No, thanks.

1:14:17.875 --> 1:14:21.812
I like it out here.

1:14:21.846 --> 1:14:24.715
I'm supposed to kill her first.

1:14:24.748 --> 1:14:28.219
Some forensics thing
Bethany's got figured out.

1:14:29.086 --> 1:14:31.255
But...

1:14:31.288 --> 1:14:34.425
you know, I bet
if I cut you now,

1:14:34.458 --> 1:14:36.694
she'd make it work.

1:14:36.727 --> 1:14:37.895
She always does.

1:14:37.928 --> 1:14:39.230
Hold on.

1:14:39.263 --> 1:14:41.298
Please don't do this.

1:14:50.407 --> 1:14:52.343
Hit him again.

1:15:00.317 --> 1:15:01.852
Good.

1:15:01.886 --> 1:15:03.954
Untie me.

1:15:05.189 --> 1:15:07.758
Are you okay?

1:15:07.791 --> 1:15:09.727
I am now.

1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:11.262
How'd you find us?

1:15:11.295 --> 1:15:13.397
I-I'll tell you later.

1:15:15.199 --> 1:15:17.201
You're hurt.

1:15:17.234 --> 1:15:19.103
I'm fine.

1:15:19.136 --> 1:15:20.838
Did you call the police?

1:15:20.871 --> 1:15:22.373
No, I left my phone in my room.

1:15:28.045 --> 1:15:29.880
Is she... Is she dead?

1:15:29.914 --> 1:15:32.850
No, she's just knocked out.

1:15:32.883 --> 1:15:34.451
Help me untie her.

1:15:36.921 --> 1:15:38.255
Okay.

1:15:38.289 --> 1:15:39.990
We're gonna have to carry her.

1:15:40.024 --> 1:15:42.393
Through the library.

1:15:52.069 --> 1:15:53.437
Hey, wait.

1:15:53.470 --> 1:15:56.173
Where you girls going?

1:16:00.144 --> 1:16:02.846
Fucking useless.

1:16:57.868 --> 1:17:00.137
You can't run from me.

1:18:26.023 --> 1:18:29.259
You shouldn't have killed
my friend.

1:18:29.293 --> 1:18:31.929
Kerrie.

1:19:11.969 --> 1:19:14.071
Hi, Alice.

1:19:19.176 --> 1:19:21.211
What happened?

1:19:21.245 --> 1:19:24.515
Bethany and Trevor
killed everyone.

1:19:24.548 --> 1:19:27.518
So, there...
there wasn't a ghost?

1:19:29.153 --> 1:19:32.055
No, I think there is a ghost.

1:19:32.089 --> 1:19:35.225
The ghost just didn't kill
your friends.

1:19:45.335 --> 1:19:47.171
You're... You're alive?

1:19:47.204 --> 1:19:49.573
Careful.

1:19:49.606 --> 1:19:51.475
You have a concussion.

1:19:51.508 --> 1:19:53.544
You know, I think we all do.

1:19:53.577 --> 1:19:56.213
But can you walk?

1:20:02.286 --> 1:20:04.521
Is... Is Bethany...

1:20:04.555 --> 1:20:06.724
She's dead.

1:20:06.758 --> 1:20:08.459
I'm gonna need you both
to go back to the dorm

1:20:08.492 --> 1:20:10.027
and call the police.

1:20:10.060 --> 1:20:11.562
Wait, you're not coming with us?

1:20:11.595 --> 1:20:13.530
Trevor's still back there.

1:20:13.564 --> 1:20:17.434
I'll tie him up and wait here
for the cops to come.

1:20:17.468 --> 1:20:20.204
I'll see you
when they get here, okay?

1:21:19.664 --> 1:21:22.834
You had to kill Bethany, huh?

1:21:22.867 --> 1:21:25.670
Literally the only girl
I ever got along with.

1:21:29.774 --> 1:21:32.242
There's nowhere to escape to.

1:21:34.645 --> 1:21:37.581
I already locked the back door.

1:21:37.614 --> 1:21:40.584
Doesn't matter
if your friends bring help.

1:21:42.887 --> 1:21:45.188
No one will get here...

1:21:47.224 --> 1:21:49.159
...in time.

1:21:58.803 --> 1:22:01.271
Hey. You under there?

1:22:11.481 --> 1:22:13.317
Aah! Aah!

1:22:22.326 --> 1:22:24.762
My leg. It's broken.

1:22:29.734 --> 1:22:32.402
Should've killed you earlier.

1:22:34.739 --> 1:22:38.375
Guess I'll be going
to that loony bin, after all.

1:22:38.408 --> 1:22:40.611
Maybe my mom can pull
a few strings,

1:22:40.644 --> 1:22:42.646
get me out in a couple years.

1:22:45.449 --> 1:22:49.553
How many friends did you have
growing up, Trevor?

1:22:49.586 --> 1:22:51.455
I don't know.

1:22:51.488 --> 1:22:53.858
I just had one.

1:22:53.891 --> 1:22:55.158
Whoa!

1:24:37.594 --> 1:24:40.230
I thought you might try
something like this.

1:24:51.408 --> 1:24:54.779
You killed him, didn't you?

1:24:54.812 --> 1:24:56.748
Of course.

1:24:59.717 --> 1:25:02.519
Alice told me what she heard.

1:25:04.354 --> 1:25:07.759
You... You did this
all for Kerrie.

1:25:07.792 --> 1:25:10.427
Kerrie and I grew up together.

1:25:12.529 --> 1:25:14.766
I owed her a lot.

1:25:18.602 --> 1:25:20.570
She killed herself.

1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:25.843
I wanted to know why.

1:25:26.110 --> 1:25:28.813
I called the police.

1:25:28.846 --> 1:25:30.380
They're gonna want
to talk to you.

1:25:30.413 --> 1:25:33.617
Well, I might be hard to find.

1:25:33.650 --> 1:25:36.788
I'm not Camille Meadows, Helina.

1:25:36.821 --> 1:25:39.957
I just used that name
to get in here.

1:25:39.991 --> 1:25:43.027
Now I'm done.

1:25:43.060 --> 1:25:45.863
Gonna find another name
for a while.

1:25:47.698 --> 1:25:50.067
So, I'm sorry, but...

1:25:50.101 --> 1:25:53.671
I'm afraid you'll have to
explain things for me.

1:25:53.704 --> 1:25:55.706
What, so that's just it?

1:25:55.740 --> 1:25:58.075
You're leaving?

1:25:58.109 --> 1:26:01.712
I mean, w-what am I supposed
to tell everyone?

1:26:01.746 --> 1:26:05.515
Tell them whatever
you want, Helina.

1:26:05.549 --> 1:26:07.484
I don't care.

1:26:10.054 --> 1:26:13.825
Then how will I be able
to reach you?

1:26:13.858 --> 1:26:16.694
I mean...

1:26:16.727 --> 1:26:18.830
if I wanted to.

1:26:41.018 --> 1:26:43.486
I'll find you.

1:26:50.995 --> 1:26:53.798
But I really have to go now.
