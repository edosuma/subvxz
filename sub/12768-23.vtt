00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:07.583 --> 00:11.083
OKAY, ARE YOU READY
TO ROLL, MR. HAGEN?

00:11.125 --> 00:13.542
I THINK GOD'S KIND OF
PISSED OFF AT ME.

00:13.583 --> 00:16.625
I CRASHED THE CAR.
WELL, LET'S NOT WORRY
ABOUT THE CAR.

00:16.667 --> 00:19.291
LET'S JUST WORRY ABOUT
GETTING YOU PUT BACK TOGETHER

00:19.333 --> 00:22.333
IN ONE PIECE.
YEAH, BUT... IT'S NOT
JUST THE CAR.

00:22.375 --> 00:24.667
I... I SCREWED UP.

00:24.709 --> 00:26.667
WELL, EVERYBODY SCREWS UP.
GOD KNOWS THAT.

00:26.709 --> 00:29.959
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE. HE PUT YOU
ON MY TABLE, DIDN'T HE?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.375
HE MUST HAVE SOME IDEA
WHAT HE'S DOING.

00:32.417 --> 00:35.041

00:35.083 --> 00:37.250

00:37.291 --> 00:40.000
(siren wails)
THEY PAGE YOU A LOT?

00:40.041 --> 00:42.375
THEY PAGE ME WHEN A HELICOPTER
LANDS AT MY HOSPITAL.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.375
YEAH, BUT IF A HELICOPTER
HADN'T LANDED AT YOUR HOSPITAL,

00:45.417 --> 00:47.375
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE FOUND
SOME OTHER REASON

00:47.417 --> 00:50.375
TO CALL IT A NIGHT,
YOU KNOW?
YOU THINK I FAKED
A HELICOPTER LANDING

00:50.417 --> 00:52.375
TO BAIL ON OUR DATE?
NO, NO, BUT--

00:52.417 --> 00:55.041
YOU WANT TO BAIL ON A DATE,
YOU FAKE A HEADACHE

00:55.083 --> 00:57.208
NOT A 2-TON FLYING MACHINE
THAT CAN BE SEEN

00:57.250 --> 01:00.375
FROM MILES AWAY.
RIGHT, RIGHT.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.

01:00.417 --> 01:02.041
SHELDON,
THE INSECURITY THING?

01:02.083 --> 01:04.166
YOU WANT ME TO STOP
THINKING ABOUT COOPER,

01:04.208 --> 01:07.041
STOP ACTING LIKE HIM.
I'LL WAIT.

01:07.083 --> 01:09.917
MAYBE YOU'LL BE DONE IN
A FEW MINUTES AND, UH... OKAY.

01:09.959 --> 01:12.166
I NEED HAND AND WRIST FILM,
PLEASE.

01:12.208 --> 01:14.917
WHAT HAVE WE GOT? MAYA?

01:14.959 --> 01:18.208
AND DELL. M.V.A.
SHE'S IN LABOR. UH,
WE WERE ON OUR WAY HERE,

01:18.250 --> 01:20.375
AND SOME GUY BLEW THROUGH
A RED LIGHT.
GOOD LORD.

01:20.417 --> 01:22.375
HER CONTRACTIONS
ARE TWO MINUTES APART,

01:22.417 --> 01:24.375
PAIN AT A SEVEN,
MAYBE EIGHT.
SIR, YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.375
I'M FINE, OKAY? MAYA'S--OW.
SIT DOWN. HE OKAY?

01:26.417 --> 01:28.959
SO FAR, SOME LACERATIONS,
PROBABLY A FRACTURED WRIST.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.041
WE NEED A FETAL DOPPLER,
AND WHERE IS RADIOLOGY?
HOW YOU FEELING, SWEETHEART?

01:32.083 --> 01:35.417
I'M OKAY. THE CONTRACTIONS
WERE PRETTY BAD,

01:35.458 --> 01:38.041
BUT IT'S MUCH BETTER NOW
WITH THE EPIDURAL.

01:38.083 --> 01:41.041
WHAT EPIDURAL? DELL?

01:41.083 --> 01:44.875
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

01:46.542 --> 01:50.041
MAYA... HOW'S THAT FEEL?

01:50.083 --> 01:52.041
WHAT?

01:52.083 --> 01:54.250
I'LL PAGE NEURO SURG.

01:54.291 --> 01:57.041
CALL AMELIA.
SHE DOESN'T WORK HERE.

01:57.083 --> 02:00.041
CALL AMELIA. SAM'S IN THE O.R.
NAI'S ON HER WAY.

02:00.083 --> 02:02.583
SHE KNOWS ABOUT THE LABOR,
BUT NOTHING ELSE.
ADDISON, DID SHE BREAK--

02:02.625 --> 02:05.875
DELL, SIT DOWN. I NEED A C.T.
OF HER SPINE. NOW, PLEASE.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.792
HEY.

02:16.041 --> 02:18.000
(Charlotte)
WE DON'T HAVE FILMS YET.

02:18.041 --> 02:20.000
BUT SHE'S GOT
SOME DISTAL SENSORY LOSS.
WHAT?

02:20.041 --> 02:22.000
SHE CAN'T FEEL HER LEGS.
SHE FRACTURED HER SPINE?

02:22.041 --> 02:24.375
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS YET.
IT MEANS
SHE FRACTURED HER SPINE.

02:24.417 --> 02:27.458
PETE--
CHARLOTTE, YOU ARE SWEATING
AND YOU ARE NOT A SWEATY GIRL.

02:27.500 --> 02:30.667
IS MAYA GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?
NAOMI'S GONNA BLOW IN
ANY MINUTE

02:30.709 --> 02:33.041
EXPECTING CONTRACTIONS AND HEAVY
BREATHING. CAN WE FOCUS ON THAT?

02:33.083 --> 02:35.417
NOW GO. SAM'S GOT A BODY OPEN
IN O.R. TWO.

02:35.458 --> 02:38.291
I GOT ANOTHER CARDIAC SURGEON ON
HIS WAY, BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE HIM

02:38.333 --> 02:40.792
ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR
TO GET HERE.
I GOT IT.

02:40.834 --> 02:42.709
HI.
NOT NOW.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.917
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NOT NOW"?
I CALLED YOU, I TEXTED YOU.

02:44.959 --> 02:46.917
I TRACKED YOU DOWN.
JAN IN RECEPTION SAID

02:46.959 --> 02:49.500
THERE WAS A HELICOPTER HERE,
WHICH I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED.

02:49.542 --> 02:51.917
BUT I JUST NEED A MOMENT
OF YOUR TIME.

02:51.959 --> 02:53.917
I THINK WE SHOULD
HAVE DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT--
UH, NO.

02:53.959 --> 02:55.291
SHELDON.
EXCUSE ME.

02:55.333 --> 02:57.792
COOPER--CAN YOU JUST TELL HIM
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:57.834 --> 03:00.041
I'D RATHER NOT, FRANKLY.
WHAT THE HELL?

03:00.083 --> 03:02.041
HEY, NAI, NAOMI.
HEY. MAYA'S IN LABOR.

03:02.083 --> 03:04.041
YEAH.
OH, SHE'S IN LABOR.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.625
OH, AND I'M--
I'M HYPERVENTILATING.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.750
I THINK I'M A LITTLE BIT
OF A HYPOCRITE,

03:07.792 --> 03:09.750
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AGAINST THIS
FROM THE GET-GO,

03:09.792 --> 03:11.750
BUT NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I AM JUST SIEGED

03:11.792 --> 03:13.750
WITH THE URGE TO JUST, LIKE,
KNIT BOOTIES AND COO.

03:13.792 --> 03:15.750
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNIT.
SO MAYBE I'M MORE SIEGED

03:15.792 --> 03:18.750
WITH THE URGE TO JUST GO OUT
AND BY A BUNCH OF BOOTIES.
NAI, NAOMI--

03:18.792 --> 03:20.750
I THINK THE UNIVERSE
IS ACTUALLY GIVING ME

03:20.792 --> 03:22.750
A LITTLE BIT OF
A-A BREAK TODAY.

03:22.792 --> 03:24.750
YOU KNOW, GABRIEL IS GIVING
WILLIAM THE A.L.S. TREATMENT.

03:24.792 --> 03:26.750
WILLIAM IS TAKING
THE A.L.S. TREATMENT.

03:26.792 --> 03:28.750
I J--I JUST FEEL LIKE
IT'S MY DAY.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.750
THE UNIVERSE IS GONNA TOLERATE
JUST A LITTLE BIT OF HYPOCRISY

03:31.792 --> 03:35.166
FROM ME AND LET ME--
NAOMI, NAOMI.
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO MAYA.

03:37.667 --> 03:39.041
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

03:39.083 --> 03:40.583
(whispers) OH, MY GOD.

03:40.625 --> 03:42.583
SHE'S GOT
PERIPHERAL ANESTHESIA,

03:42.625 --> 03:44.792
POSSIBLE FRACTURE
AT L-2 OR 3.

03:44.834 --> 03:47.166
OKAY. WELL,
IS THE CORD TRANSECTED?
I DON'T KNOW.

03:47.208 --> 03:50.208
WHAT ABOUT THE BABY?
I'M GONNA DO A C-SECTION.
WE'RE GOING IN NOW.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.250
THE O.R.'s READY.
NAOMI, I AM SO SORRY.

03:52.291 --> 03:55.000
DELL, YOU DIDN'T DO THIS.

03:55.041 --> 03:57.375
MOM, I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

03:57.417 --> 03:59.375
MOMMY'S HERE.
WHERE'S DADDY?

03:59.417 --> 04:02.166
HANG IN THERE, MAYA, OKAY? WE'RE
GONNA GO HAVE YOUR BABY NOW.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.792
LET'S GO. NOW.
LET'S GO.

04:04.834 --> 04:07.834
(man speaks indistinctly)

04:07.875 --> 04:10.500
(instruments scraping)

04:10.542 --> 04:13.208
(suction gurgling)
(woman speaks indistinctly)

04:13.250 --> 04:16.875
HEY. YOU GOT NOTHING BETTER
TO DO ON A FRIDAY NIGHT?

04:16.917 --> 04:19.875
I NEED YOU FOR A QUICK CONSULT.
CAN YOU STEP OUT FOR A SEC?
IT COULD BE A WHILE.

04:19.917 --> 04:21.875
THIS GUY AVULSED
HIS PULMONARY ARTERY,

04:21.917 --> 04:25.208
SMASHED HIS BEEMER,
SMASHED HIS RIB CAGE.

04:25.250 --> 04:28.041
HE THINKS
GOD'S PISSED OFF AT HIM.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.834
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

04:32.667 --> 04:34.625
THAT'S THE GUY
THAT HIT MAYA AND DELL--

04:34.667 --> 04:37.917
ON SAM'S TABLE
UNDER SAM'S KNIFE.
I KNOW THAT.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.917
DOES SAM?
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

04:39.959 --> 04:41.917
WE CAN'T DUCT TAPE
THE GUY CLOSED.

04:41.959 --> 04:44.083
SAM'S GOTTA KEEP OPERATING
TILL MASON GETS HERE.

04:44.125 --> 04:46.959
WELL, YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?

04:52.125 --> 04:55.041
C-SECTIONS ARE BAD.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.041
I WANTED TO HAVE HIM
THE REGULAR WAY.

04:57.083 --> 04:59.041
OH, C-SECTIONS
ARE NOT BAD.

04:59.083 --> 05:01.041
THEY ARE FAST
AND THEY'RE SAFE.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.041
ADDISON HAS DONE
A GAJILLION OF THESE.

05:03.083 --> 05:05.083
SHE COULD DO THIS
IN HER SLEEP.
YOU JUST FOCUS ON THE FACT

05:05.125 --> 05:07.667
THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE
YOUR BABY, MAYA.

05:07.709 --> 05:11.458
OKAY. THERE WE GO.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.500
YOU GOT
A NICE-LOOKING UTERUS, KID.

05:13.542 --> 05:16.041
EW.
ALL RIGHT. LAP PAD.

05:16.083 --> 05:20.500
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

05:20.542 --> 05:22.417
(monitor beeping erratically)

05:22.458 --> 05:24.750
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:24.792 --> 05:27.083
HER PRESSURE'S DROPPING.
OPEN UP HER I.V.

05:27.125 --> 05:30.709
WH-WHY IS
HER PRESSURE DROPPING?
I DON'T KNOW.
RUN THE FLUIDS WIDE OPEN.

05:30.750 --> 05:33.417
MAYA. MAYA!
B.P.'S DOWN
TO 80 OVER 30.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.333
WHAT--WHAT-- WHAT DID YOU?
I TILTED HER UTERUS. I WAS
CHECKING THE BABY'S POSITION.

05:36.375 --> 05:39.291
WELL, IS SHE BLEEDING OUT?
I DON'T KN--NAOMI,
YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.041
DELL, GET HER OUT OF HERE.
NAOMI--

05:41.083 --> 05:43.291
DO NOT TOUCH ME.
UTERUS MUST HAVE BEEN
TAMPONADING

05:43.333 --> 05:46.041
THE RADICULAR ARTERY.
I CAN'T MOVE THE BABY

05:46.083 --> 05:48.917
OR SHE'LL BOTTOM OUT.
ADDISON, HER PRESSURE
IS DROPPING. YOU'RE LOSING HER.

05:48.959 --> 05:51.500
NAOMI, YOU NEED TO GET OUT
OF HERE OR YOU SHUT UP.

05:51.542 --> 05:54.333
THE BABY STAYS IN.
WE NEED TO PACK THE WOUND.
(Dell) TACHY AT 140. WE'RE
NOT PICKING UP HER PRESSURE.

05:54.375 --> 05:57.041
OKAY, FULL PRESSORS.
PULL THE CRASH CART.
MAYA, STAY WITH ME.

05:57.083 --> 05:58.417
BABY, STAY WITH ME. OKAY?
YOU STAY WITH ME.

06:05.291 --> 06:08.667
HOW LONG CAN THE BABY
STAY IN ONCE--
NOT VERY LONG.

06:10.083 --> 06:14.000
LET'S JUST WAIT AND SEE
WHAT AMELIA HAS TO SAY, OKAY?

06:16.375 --> 06:18.125
I ALMOST LOST HER.

06:18.166 --> 06:19.625
I KNOW.

06:19.667 --> 06:23.125
I'M HERE.
I'M LATE. I'M LATE. I'M SORRY.

06:23.166 --> 06:27.500
BUT I GOT THE CAMERA,
SO SHE CAN START PUSHING.

06:27.542 --> 06:29.667
WHAT?
WAS IT A FALSE ALARM?

06:29.709 --> 06:31.875
WHAT?

06:37.542 --> 06:40.041
I WAS JUST
GONNA COME FIND YOU.

06:40.083 --> 06:42.667
I, UH, SET UP THE DRIP
IN PETE'S OFFICE.

06:42.709 --> 06:45.291
YOU CAN LIE THERE AND STARE
AT ALL THOSE JARS,

06:45.333 --> 06:48.500
WONDER WHAT THE HELL
HE DOES WITH 'EM.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO
THE TREATMENT.

06:48.542 --> 06:52.583
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO THE HOSPITAL,
AND I'M GOING TO SUN VALLEY.

06:52.625 --> 06:54.583
NAOMI'S DAUGHTER
WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

06:54.625 --> 06:57.500
SHE MAY HAVE BROKEN
HER BACK.
WHAT?

06:57.542 --> 06:59.500
YOU MOCKED ME
FOR HAVING THREE ASSISTANTS,

06:59.542 --> 07:01.667
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE
THREE ASSISTANTS,

07:01.709 --> 07:03.625
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

07:03.667 --> 07:06.041
VALERIE'S THE BEST ONE
OF THE LOT.

07:06.083 --> 07:09.041
YOU SHOULD USE HER
WHEN I'M GONE.
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:09.083 --> 07:11.750
THE TREATMENT WON'T WORK.
YOU KNOW THAT.

07:11.792 --> 07:14.041
IT'S TOO LATE.

07:14.083 --> 07:17.709
YOU COULDN'T TELL THAT
TO NAOMI?

07:17.750 --> 07:20.625
SHE NEEDED SOMETHING
TO HOPE FOR.

07:20.667 --> 07:22.500
WHAT'S IN SUN VALLEY?

07:22.542 --> 07:26.041
A DAUGHTER
WHO DOESN'T LIKE ME

07:26.083 --> 07:29.417
AND WHO I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

07:29.458 --> 07:32.333
AND WHAT, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA GO THERE TO DIE?

07:36.083 --> 07:40.083
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
GONNA SAY GOOD-BYE TO HER?

07:40.125 --> 07:43.125
TELL HER THE--THE DRUGS
ARE HELPING.

07:43.166 --> 07:46.583
TELL HER I'M RESTING,
THAT SHE SHOULDN'T BOTHER ME.

07:46.625 --> 07:49.166
AND WHEN MAYA'S
OUT OF THE WOODS,

07:49.208 --> 07:51.917
TELL HER I LEFT...

07:51.959 --> 07:53.792
AND I LOVE HER.

08:02.083 --> 08:04.333
YOU LOVE HER, TOO,
DON'T YOU?

08:10.083 --> 08:13.125
BE A BETTER MAN
THAN YOU HAVE BEEN.

08:24.959 --> 08:26.917
(Sheldon)
IT'S GONNA BE A LONG NIGHT.

08:26.959 --> 08:29.500
I COULD STOP BY YOUR HOUSE
AND PICK UP SOME CLOTHES.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.500
NAH, I GOT SOME CLOTHES
BACK IN MY OFFICE.

08:31.542 --> 08:34.083
I JUST HAVEN'T HAD A SECOND
TO PUT 'EM ON YET.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.792
THANKS, THOUGH. YOU'RE SWEET.
I'M NOT.

08:36.834 --> 08:40.500
BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
I'M WILLING TO FAKE IT.

08:40.542 --> 08:43.000
I GOTTA--
YEAH.

08:44.709 --> 08:46.834
HI, GUYS.
HEY.

08:46.875 --> 08:48.041
HEY.

08:48.083 --> 08:50.333
HEY, UH, LUCAS
IS WITH DANIELLE,

08:50.375 --> 08:53.125
THE SITTER FROM UP THE STREET
I TOLD YOU ABOUT WITH THE HAIR.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.750
ANYWAY, SHE'S AT THE HOUSE.

08:54.792 --> 08:56.750
SHE KNOWS IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG NIGHT.
OKAY.

08:56.792 --> 08:59.041
I WOULD'VE TOLD YOU EARLIER,
BUT WITH ALL THE CONFUSION--

08:59.083 --> 09:01.667
I'M SORRY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
ANYTHING TO ME, PETE.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.041
I KINDA DO.

09:04.083 --> 09:05.667
IT'S CO-PARENTING.

09:05.709 --> 09:09.041
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.
I TELL YOU WHERE THE KID IS.

09:09.083 --> 09:11.625
IT'S NOT A HARDSHIP.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.208
WELL, THANK YOU.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.917
I'M GONNA GO WAIT FOR SAM.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.792
SEE RIGHT THERE?
FRACTURE AT L-2

09:20.834 --> 09:23.375
AND THEN ANOTHER CHARD OF BONE
HERE AT L-3.

09:23.417 --> 09:25.375
THE BABY WAS STABILIZING
THE WHOLE AREA,

09:25.417 --> 09:29.375
SO WHEN YOU SHIFTED THE UTERUS,
ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE.
SO WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS?

09:29.417 --> 09:31.875
WELL, NAI, HOW ABOUT
YOU GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE,

09:31.917 --> 09:35.041
AND WE CAN TALK
ABOUT IT A LITTLE--
JUST ANSWER THE QUESTION.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.709
NAI, I THINK THAT AMELIA
WANTS TO BRAINSTORM A LITTLE.

09:37.750 --> 09:40.709
SO IT'S--IT'S EASIER WHEN
THE MOTHER'S NOT HERE--
WELL, I-I'M SORRY
IF THIS IS DIFFICULT FOR HER.

09:40.750 --> 09:43.041
JUST STOP MANAGING ME.
SPIT IT OUT.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.041
OKAY.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.333
IF WE TAKE OUT THE BABY,
THE CORD STROKES OUT.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.500
SHE'S PARALYZED FROM

09:59.583 --> 10:01.959

A PREFERENCE?

10:09.542 --> 10:12.500

10:12.542 --> 10:14.500
THANK YOU.
WALK WITH ME.

10:14.542 --> 10:16.500
FIVE MINUTES WHILE THEY
PUT HIM ON THE PUMP,

10:16.542 --> 10:19.041

TO GET OUT OF HERE,

10:19.083 --> 10:21.667

PROGRESSING.
COME ON. JUST WALK.

10:21.709 --> 10:23.667
OKAY. THANK YOU.
DRINK THIS.

10:23.709 --> 10:26.041
I'M GOOD. YOU KNOW THERE'S
TOO MUCH SUGAR IN THAT STUFF.

10:26.083 --> 10:29.041

YOU'VE BEEN OPERATING, JUST--
WHAT IS THIS?
YOU SOUND LIKE MY AUNT.

10:29.083 --> 10:32.709
JUST DRINK
THE CRAPPY DRINK, SAM.
OKAY, I'M GONNA DRINK IT.
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO WEIRD?

10:32.750 --> 10:35.083
MAYA AND DELL
WERE IN A CAR ACCIDENT

10:35.125 --> 10:37.083
ON THEIR WAY
TO THE HOSPITAL.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.083
MAYA BROKE HER L-2,
POSSIBLY L-3.

10:39.125 --> 10:42.125

10:42.166 --> 10:43.792

10:51.375 --> 10:53.458
(Sam) HYPOTHERMIA?
YOU LOWER THE BODY TEMPERATURE,
YOU DECREASE METABOLIC DEMANDS

10:53.500 --> 10:55.500
AND YOU LIMIT DAMAGE
TO THE SPINAL CORD.

10:55.542 --> 10:58.041
GIVES DR. SHEPHERD
A LOT MORE TIME TO WORK

10:58.083 --> 11:01.917
AND MAYBE SHE'S GOT A SHOT
AT AVOIDING PARALYSIS.
YEAH, BUT THERE'S A BABY
INSIDE OF HER. HYPOTHERMIA?

11:01.959 --> 11:04.417
IT WOULD KILL THE BABY.
IT MAY KILL THE BABY.

11:04.458 --> 11:07.583
IT'LL SAVE THE SPINAL CORD.
IT MAY
SAVE THE SPINAL CORD.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.834
SO--SO IF--
IF WE SAVE HER CHILD,

11:09.875 --> 11:12.417
THEN WE ENSURE THAT--
THAT SHE'S PARALYZED FOR LIFE,

11:12.458 --> 11:15.417
BUT IF WE KILL THE BABY,
THEN--THEN SHE WILL WALK AGAIN?

11:15.458 --> 11:18.208
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SAYING?

11:18.250 --> 11:20.041
IS THAT
WHAT WE'RE SAYING?

11:20.083 --> 11:23.041
LOOK, I'M NOT USUALLY THE GLASS-
HALF-FULL GUY IN THE ROOM,

11:23.083 --> 11:24.417
BUT SHE'S NOT GONNA DIE.

11:24.458 --> 11:26.583
I UNDERSTAND THAT'S PROGRESS
FROM THE INITIAL DIAGNOSIS.

11:26.625 --> 11:29.625
BUT SHE MAY NEVER WALK AGAIN.
(Gabriel) A CHAIR
IS NOT A DEATH SENTENCE.

11:29.667 --> 11:33.041
I MEAN, PEOPLE TOLD ME THAT
EVERY DAY, AND AS MUCH AS IT

11:33.083 --> 11:36.375
MADE ME WANT TO SMACK 'EM
IN THE FACE, THEY WERE RIGHT.
SAVE HER LEGS.
I-I WANT HER TO WALK AGAIN.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.750

WHAT ABOUT THE BABY?

11:38.792 --> 11:41.208

THAT SHE'S CARRYING.
I'M AWARE OF THAT.

11:41.250 --> 11:44.542

I-I AM AWARE OF THAT, SAM.

11:46.250 --> 11:48.333

11:48.375 --> 11:51.041

IN THIS BED!

WHAT'S THE DEAL, NAOMI?

11:51.083 --> 11:54.041

20:16.000 --> 20:17.875
YOU'RE ABOUT TO OPERATE
ON MY BABY.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.250
YOU HAVE TO LET ME DO THIS.

20:20.291 --> 20:22.291
(voice breaking)
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.709
I FORGIVE YOU.

20:24.750 --> 20:27.375
GOD, THERE'S NOTHING
TO FORGIVE.

20:27.417 --> 20:29.000
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

20:29.041 --> 20:31.041
YOU DIDN'T
SLEEP WITH MY HUSBAND.

20:31.083 --> 20:32.375
HE'S NOT MY HUSBAND...

20:32.417 --> 20:35.667
AND YOU DIDN'T SLEEP
WITH HIM.

20:35.709 --> 20:37.709
YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT ME

20:37.750 --> 20:40.083
AND YOU WERE TRYING
TO PROTECT ME.

20:40.125 --> 20:42.083
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I COULDN'T SEE THAT.

20:42.125 --> 20:45.041
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL I WAS DOING.
NAI--

20:45.083 --> 20:47.083
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.
I DO.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.083
DO YOU HEAR ME?

20:49.125 --> 20:51.667
I DO.
OKAY.

20:51.709 --> 20:54.583
I LOVE YOU
AND I LOVE YOUR DAUGHTER.

20:54.625 --> 20:56.333
I DELIVERED THAT KID.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.333
I WAS THERE WHEN SHE CUT
HER FIRST TOOTH.

20:58.375 --> 21:01.041
I RECORDED HER SINGING
"WUDOLPH THE WED-NOSE WEINDEER"

21:01.083 --> 21:02.959
BEFORE SHE COULD PRONOUNCE
HER R's...
(laughs)

21:03.000 --> 21:04.875
AND I LISTENED TO IT
ON MY TAPE DECK

21:04.917 --> 21:06.333
EVERY NIGHT FOR A MONTH.

21:06.375 --> 21:10.333

22:57.583 --> 22:59.000
THANKS.

23:04.250 --> 23:07.959
ARE WE ALL JUST WAITING FOR ME
TO HAVE A P.T.S.D. FREAK-OUT?
(chuckles) NO.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.500
(Cooper) WHAT?
OF COURSE NOT.
WHY WOULD...

23:12.625 --> 23:14.583
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

23:14.625 --> 23:17.041
I AM FREAKING OUT.

23:17.083 --> 23:19.083
WE SHOULD ALL
BE FREAKING OUT.

23:19.125 --> 23:22.166
I MEAN, A YEAR AGO...
A YEAR AGO, I WAS DYING.

23:22.208 --> 23:25.250
AND WE GOT THROUGH THAT. WE GOT
ANOTHER YEAR UNDER OUR BELTS.

23:25.291 --> 23:27.250
AND... ONCE AGAIN,
HERE WE ARE

23:27.291 --> 23:31.458
IN THE SAME PLACE...
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE...

23:31.500 --> 23:35.041
I JUST WANT TO SCREAM
TO WHOEVER KEEPS DOING THIS

23:35.083 --> 23:36.500
TO JUST STOP...

23:36.542 --> 23:40.875
STOP BRINGING US HERE WITH
ANOTHER ONE OF OUR OWN DYING.

23:40.917 --> 23:42.875
SHE'S NOT DYING.

23:42.917 --> 23:45.166
SHE'S NOT.

23:51.542 --> 23:53.500
ALMOST WORSE BEING THE ONES
OUT HERE

23:53.542 --> 23:55.041
WAITING FOR THE NEWS,
RIGHT?

23:58.583 --> 24:00.625
YOU KNOW,
I-I-I GOTTA BE HONEST.

24:00.667 --> 24:03.041
IT'S ACTUALLY WORSE
BEING THE ONE SLICED OPEN

24:03.083 --> 24:04.500
AND BLEEDING ON THE TABLE.

24:04.542 --> 24:06.083
IT'S--
(laughs)

24:06.125 --> 24:08.333
(laughs)

24:08.375 --> 24:11.041
(Pete chuckles)
(laughs)

24:11.083 --> 24:14.750
I'M SORRY. I KNOW IT WAS
A BAD DAY FOR YOU, TOO.

24:16.500 --> 24:20.000
IT WAS A REALLY BAD DAY.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.500
ANYWAY, UH...

24:27.542 --> 24:30.125
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT
ANYTHING SO MORBID.

24:30.166 --> 24:32.041
OKAY? I-I HAVE SOMETHING.

24:32.083 --> 24:35.000
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE...
FOR, UH...

24:35.041 --> 24:36.375
LUCAS' BIRTHDAY,

24:36.417 --> 24:38.542
BECAUSE I-I WANTED
TO DO SOMETHING...

24:38.583 --> 24:41.542
OF COURSE, YEAH.
OKAY, WELL, THIS MIGHT BE
BLOWING THE SURPRISE,

24:41.583 --> 24:45.542
BUT, UM... I WANTED TO GET
A PICTURE OF YOU AND LUCAS.

24:45.583 --> 24:49.041
SO I SWIPED YOUR CAMERA BECAUSE
I WAS GONNA DOWNLOAD ONE.

24:49.083 --> 24:50.750
BUT YOU'RE A SINGLE DAD,

24:50.792 --> 24:52.750
SO ALL THE PICTURES
ARE JUST OF LUCAS.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.750
THERE'S NONE
OF YOU TWO TOGETHER.

24:54.792 --> 24:58.166
SO I LOOKED
AT ALL YOUR PHONES,

24:58.208 --> 25:01.375
AND EVERYBODY HAS AT LEAST
ONE PICTURE OF PETE AND LUCAS.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.583
BUT...
(paper rustles)

25:03.625 --> 25:05.583
IF THIS ISN'T
THE CRAPPIEST COLLECTION

25:05.625 --> 25:08.166
OF OUT-OF-FOCUS
CELL PHONE PICTURES.

25:08.208 --> 25:10.083
I MEAN, LOOK.

25:10.125 --> 25:12.000
LOOK AT THIS.
OH, WOW.

25:12.041 --> 25:13.625
RIGHT?
YEAH, THAT'S BAD.

25:13.667 --> 25:16.041
I MEAN, I CAN'T PUT
ANY OF THESE IN A FRAME.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.917
IT'S JUST EMBARRASSING.

25:17.959 --> 25:19.750
OH, WOW.
YOU'RE GOOD-LOOKING,

25:19.792 --> 25:22.125
BUT YOU
DO NOT PHOTOGRAPH WELL.

25:22.166 --> 25:24.875
OH, I TOOK THIS ONE.
IT'S NOT BAD.

25:24.917 --> 25:28.375
IT'S LUCAS
AND MY NOSTRILS.
YEAH, WELL, IT'S IN FOCUS.

25:28.417 --> 25:30.458
I KINDA LIKE THIS ONE.

25:30.500 --> 25:33.750
IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GONNA EAT YOUR FACE.
OR SWAB ME.

25:33.792 --> 25:36.834
THAT KID CAN DROOL.
I'M TELLING YOU. LOOK AT THAT.
(laughs)

25:36.875 --> 25:39.333
(speaks indistinctly)
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

25:39.375 --> 25:41.041
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

25:41.083 --> 25:43.417
MAYA'S TEMP IS DOWN.
HER PRESSURE'S HOLDING.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.417
BABY LOOKS GOOD
ON THE MONITOR.

25:45.458 --> 25:47.792
AMELIA'S ABOUT TO GET STARTED,
SO, UH...

25:47.834 --> 25:50.333
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

25:50.375 --> 25:52.709
THANK YOU.

25:56.959 --> 25:59.458
(speaks indistinctly)

26:08.083 --> 26:10.709
(inhales deeply)
WELL, IF WE'RE LOOKING

26:10.750 --> 26:12.917
FOR A CHEERIER TOPIC
OF CONVERSATION...

26:12.959 --> 26:15.041
YES. YES, WE ARE.

26:15.083 --> 26:16.500
I'M, UM...

26:16.542 --> 26:18.500
GETTING MARRIED.

26:18.542 --> 26:19.834
WHAT?

26:19.875 --> 26:21.417
TO WHOM?

26:21.458 --> 26:23.083
TO CHARLOTTE.
WHAT?

26:23.125 --> 26:25.041
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YEAH, GOT A RING,
POPPED THE QUESTION.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.208
YOU GOT A RING?
YEAH, YOU SAID,
"GO GET YOUR GIRL."

26:27.250 --> 26:29.208
I WENT RING SHOPPING.
YOU SAID
"GO GET YOUR GIRL"?

26:29.250 --> 26:31.542
WELL, I-I MEANT TAKE HER OUT
TO DINNER, NOT MARRY HER.

26:31.583 --> 26:33.959
I WAS TAKING HER TO DINNER.
WELL, I-I--
I'M SORRY, SHELDON.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.125
BUT THEY ARE SORT OF
MADE FOR EACH OTHER

26:36.166 --> 26:39.125
IN A TWISTED KIND OF WAY,
BUT--BUT FOR DATING--
YOU ARE NOT MARRYING HER.

26:39.166 --> 26:41.333
I KIND OF AM.
COOPER--

26:41.375 --> 26:44.250
I THINK "CONGRATULATIONS" IS
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY, RIGHT?

26:44.291 --> 26:46.250
CONGRATULATIONS?
(Naomi)
IT'S FANTASTIC, COOPER.

26:46.291 --> 26:48.041
(Sam) CONGRATULATIONS.
(Violet) WOW. WOW.

26:48.083 --> 26:50.041
JUST SAY IT. SAY THE WORD.
CONGRATULATIONS.

26:50.083 --> 26:52.750
DELL. SHELDON. EVEN YOU, MAN.
COME ON. SORRY.

26:52.792 --> 26:54.333
JUST...

26:57.166 --> 26:59.083
(Violet whispers) PETE.

26:59.125 --> 27:01.417
OKAY. MAYBE THAT WAS
A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO ASK.

27:01.458 --> 27:03.375
DELL, COME ON.
GIVE THE MAN A HUG.

27:03.417 --> 27:05.375
HE'S GETTING HITCHED
TO A... DIFFICULT WOMAN.

27:05.417 --> 27:06.792
HEY.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.458
(Naomi) DELL.

27:09.500 --> 27:10.959
DELL?

27:11.000 --> 27:13.542
DELL, WAKE UP, SWEETIE.
WAKE UP.
(taps leg)

27:13.583 --> 27:16.041
(Pete) DELL. DELL.
(Naomi) DELL?
GUYS, HE'S UNRESPONSIVE.

27:16.083 --> 27:17.458
(Pete speaks indistinctly)

27:17.500 --> 27:20.041
WE HAVE A PATIENT DOWN
IN THE O.R. WAITING ROOM.

27:20.083 --> 27:21.458
SEND A CRASH CART.

27:21.500 --> 27:24.041
WE ARE NOT CATCHING
A BREAK TODAY.

27:24.083 --> 27:26.583
HEY, GIVE ME SOME MANNITOL.
HE'S BRADYING DOWN.
HE'S GOT A BLEED IN HIS HEAD.

27:26.625 --> 27:28.166
THINK HE'S HERNIATING?
YEP. GET ME A TWIST DRILL.

27:28.208 --> 27:30.166
BURR HOLES?
I NEED TO RELIEVE
THE PRESSURE.

27:30.208 --> 27:32.000
UM, IS HE GOOD?
WHO ARE YOU?

27:32.041 --> 27:34.542
I'M MARCEL, HIS LIFE PARTNER.
IS HE GOOD?

27:34.583 --> 27:38.417
HE'S DONE THIS
PLENTY OF TIMES.
MAYBE WE CALL OVER TO THE O.R.,
S-SEE IF AMELIA CAN STEP OUT?

27:38.458 --> 27:41.709
(Naomi) NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO. NO STEPPING OUT. NO.
HIS BRAIN IS EXPLODING.

27:41.750 --> 27:44.709
YEAH, AND MAYA'S SPINE
IS FLAPPING IN THE BREEZE.
COULD WE GET THE BACKSEAT
DRIVERS OUT OF THE ROOM?

27:44.750 --> 27:48.083
Y'ALL, SHUT UP OR GET OUT.
(drill whirring)

27:50.417 --> 27:52.041
NOBODY TOOK A PICTURE?
NO.

27:52.083 --> 27:55.375
COME ON. THERE WAS A GUY
DRILLING A HOLE IN MY HEAD

27:55.417 --> 27:58.500
WITH SIX OF YOU WATCHING.
NOBODY PULLED OUT A CELL PHONE?
YOU GONNA MAKE ME SEDATE YOU?

27:58.542 --> 28:01.041
GET SOME SLEEP.
HEY.

28:01.083 --> 28:03.417
(lowered voice)
COOPER PROPOSED TO CHARLOTTE.

28:03.458 --> 28:05.542
(whispers) THAT'S CRAZY.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.583
(whispers) I KNOW.
(normal voice) O-OH.

28:07.625 --> 28:10.083
OW.
WHAT "OW"?

28:10.125 --> 28:12.041
NOTHING,
JUST A KILLER HEADACHE.

28:12.083 --> 28:14.333
WELL, THEY DRILLED
A HOLE IN YOUR HEAD.

28:14.375 --> 28:17.041
HANDS UP...
OKAY.

28:17.083 --> 28:20.000
LIKE THIS. DON'T MOVE.
OKAY.

28:20.041 --> 28:22.000
(groans)

28:24.250 --> 28:27.000
OH, DAMN IT.
WHAT?

28:29.041 --> 28:31.375
IT'S DR. KING. I NEED
A VENTRICULOSTOMY SETUP

28:31.417 --> 28:33.375
AND A HEAD C.T.

28:33.417 --> 28:35.417
NO, RIGHT NOW.

28:35.458 --> 28:37.333
(receiver clatters)
CHARLOTTE?

28:37.375 --> 28:40.041
Yeah, there's a bleed
on the contralateral side.

28:40.083 --> 28:42.041
The epidural pressure
was holding it back.

28:42.083 --> 28:44.291
NOW IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE.
What does that mean?

28:44.333 --> 28:47.041
It means you gotta crack
your patient open.

28:47.083 --> 28:49.041
How much longer
you got in here?

28:49.083 --> 28:52.041
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE AN HOUR.
Think you can do it after?

28:52.083 --> 28:54.458
She's had a long night,
Charlotte. Page Steiner.

28:54.500 --> 28:58.000
Steiner's out of town. James
is covering. James missed it.
(Amelia) WELL,
IT'S AN HONEST MISTAKE.

28:58.041 --> 29:00.709
I MEAN,
WITH A BLEED LIKE THAT--
It's Dell.

29:00.750 --> 29:03.000
THE PATIENT'S DELL.

29:03.041 --> 29:04.792
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:04.834 --> 29:07.041
I'LL BE OUT
AS SOON AS I CAN.

29:07.083 --> 29:09.667
(beeping continues)

29:09.709 --> 29:12.208
THIS IS A CRAP DAY.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.250
(beeping continues)

29:14.291 --> 29:16.250
(Charlotte)
IT'S ANOTHER BLEED.

29:16.291 --> 29:18.667
AND IT'S EXPANDING.
BUT WE CAN GET IT.

29:18.709 --> 29:21.041
JUST MEANS WE NEED TO DO
SOME MORE DAMAGE TO YOUR SKULL.

29:21.083 --> 29:22.834
AND AMELIA'S
ALMOST DONE WITH MAYA,

29:22.875 --> 29:24.500
SO SHE CAN DO THE PROCEDURE.

29:24.542 --> 29:27.291
SAYS SHE'LL GET A KICK
OUT OF SEEING YOUR BRAIN.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.834
MEANWHILE, I'M GONNA GET
THE MOST ATTRACTIVE

29:29.875 --> 29:31.834
OF OUR NURSES
TO COME AND SHAVE YOUR HEAD.

29:31.875 --> 29:33.834
AND YOU CAN WORK THAT BUZZ CUT

29:33.875 --> 29:37.417
FOR A FEW WEEKS
UNTIL THAT MOP GROWS BACK.

29:37.458 --> 29:40.041
UM...

29:40.083 --> 29:43.083
BETSEY'S AT HOME
WITH A SITTER NAMED ANDREA.

29:43.125 --> 29:45.083
I WANT YOU
TO BRING HER HERE.

29:45.125 --> 29:47.834
COME ON, DELL--
VIOLET.

29:47.875 --> 29:50.083
IT'S THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.
(Charlotte) VIOLET...

29:50.125 --> 29:52.041
GET BETSEY.
