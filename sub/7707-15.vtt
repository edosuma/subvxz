WEBVTT

00:02.136 --> 00:04.603
Hey, hey, did you know that
if you looked really carefully

00:04.605 --> 00:09.942
you could see Elvis in one
of the crowd scenes in Gandhi?

00:09.944 --> 00:12.745
Do you believe
everything you read?

00:12.747 --> 00:17.049
Yeah...except for stuff
marked unbreakable.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.118
Where'd you get that book
anyway?

00:19.120 --> 00:21.787
I joined the legend
of the month club.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.922
Next month,
they're doing Steve Allen.

00:23.924 --> 00:26.225
[sighs]
Sorry, I asked.

00:26.227 --> 00:29.595
ALF, Elvis Presley died
more than ten years ago.

00:29.597 --> 00:30.796
Oh, yeah?

00:30.798 --> 00:31.864
Then how do you explain

00:31.866 --> 00:33.665
this shocking photograph

00:33.667 --> 00:38.604
of Elvis standing in line
for Pirates Of The Caribbean?

00:38.606 --> 00:43.208
- I was on that ride.
- Then we have an eyewitness.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.944
ALF, if Elvis were alive, do you
think he'd be out in public

00:45.946 --> 00:48.747
where people could take shocking
photographs of him?

00:48.749 --> 00:51.450
Well, here's something
that should convince even you

00:51.452 --> 00:54.086
doubting Tanner.

00:54.088 --> 00:56.989
A picture of Elvis
at a swap meet.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.561
What's he buying?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.530
A hubcap?

01:04.532 --> 01:06.398
That's a belt buckle.

01:09.336 --> 01:11.336
[theme music]

01:40.634 --> 01:42.634
[music continues]

02:10.898 --> 02:12.231
[instrumental music]

02:14.635 --> 02:17.369
[grunts]
Oh!

02:17.371 --> 02:19.771
'Oh!'

02:19.773 --> 02:21.874
Oh!

02:21.876 --> 02:23.976
Oh!

02:23.978 --> 02:26.278
- What is he doing?
- 'Oh.'

02:26.280 --> 02:28.647
- 'Oh.'
- Facial exercises.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.882
Oh!

02:29.884 --> 02:32.484
This one tightens up
a double chin.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.253
Oh!

02:34.255 --> 02:35.687
Oh!

02:35.689 --> 02:38.624
This one prevents sagging ears.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.292
Oh!

02:40.294 --> 02:41.994
Oh!

02:41.996 --> 02:43.795
Oh!

02:43.797 --> 02:45.564
[gasps]

02:45.566 --> 02:46.698
What's that one?

02:46.700 --> 02:49.635
That one means Raquel's
coming up the back walk.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.070
Hi-ho, Silver! Away!

02:52.072 --> 02:54.406
(Raquel)
'Yoo-hoo!'

02:54.408 --> 02:57.676
- Hello, Willie.
- Oh, hi, Raquel. Come on in.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.044
Kate,
I brought your magazine back.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.412
Oh, thanks, Raquel.

03:00.414 --> 03:01.813
How'd you like
Sylvester Stallone's

03:01.815 --> 03:03.982
pot roast recipe?

03:03.984 --> 03:05.484
It was a real disappointment.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.352
I had to pound on that beef
for two hours

03:07.354 --> 03:09.922
and Trevor still said
it was tough.

03:09.924 --> 03:12.558
First "Rambo III," now this.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.994
Let's face it,
Sly's in a slump.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.096
Oh, point of interest.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.698
Have you met the man
who has rented

03:19.700 --> 03:21.300
the Phennamen's old house?

03:21.302 --> 03:24.636
Oh, somebody rented
the Phennamen's old house?

03:24.638 --> 03:28.040
Well, wake up and wipe the crud
from your eyes, Willie.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.842
The man has been here
six whole days.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.612
- What's he like, Raquel?
- His name is Aaron King.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.582
Let's see,
he's in his early 50s.

03:36.584 --> 03:39.084
He has a Southern accent
and he sings in the shower.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.286
Other than that,
I know nothing.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.023
Well, we all have
our little secrets.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.758
Oh, really?

03:46.760 --> 03:48.961
Like what?

03:48.963 --> 03:51.063
Uh..

03:51.065 --> 03:53.365
I sing in the shower too.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.901
Why do you think
the Phennamen's moved out?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.569
Well, ta.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.277
We've found him.
We've found Elvis.

04:05.279 --> 04:10.482
Oh, good. I was getting tired
of looking for him.

04:10.484 --> 04:15.420
I'm serious, Willie.
The king lives two doors down.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.123
ALF, you don't really
believe that.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.826
Willie, I thought
Paul McCartney was dead.

04:20.828 --> 04:25.230
I thought Bobby Ewing was dead,
and I thought Chrysler was dead.

04:25.232 --> 04:27.132
I won't be fooled again.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.236
Oh, come on.

04:31.238 --> 04:34.539
Well, look, Raquel said
this guy's in his 50s

04:34.541 --> 04:38.644
he has a Southern accent,
and he likes to sing.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.812
Who else could it be?

04:40.814 --> 04:44.283
Willie Nelson,
Jerry Lee Lewis

04:44.285 --> 04:47.052
Huckleberry Hound.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.820
No, no, no.

04:48.822 --> 04:53.292
Those guys would never live
next to the Ochmonek's.

04:53.294 --> 04:56.495
ALF, this book does not have
one shred of evidence

04:56.497 --> 04:59.631
that would convince
any rational thinking.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.733
[grunts]
Oh!

05:01.735 --> 05:03.869
Oh!

05:03.871 --> 05:05.771
- Oh!
- I give up.

05:05.773 --> 05:09.408
Wait, wait, wait. I can be
logical if I have to.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.010
The man's name is Aaron King.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.479
Elvis' middle name was Aaron

05:14.481 --> 05:18.216
and he was king
of rock and roll.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.918
I am not convinced.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.087
Okay. How about this?

05:22.089 --> 05:25.524
Hank Aaron is baseball's
home run king

05:25.526 --> 05:29.861
and Elvis loved baseball.

05:29.863 --> 05:33.465
ALF, you're grasping at straws.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.534
Okay. Listen to this.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.603
Aaron Burr wanted
to be king of America

05:38.605 --> 05:42.174
and he was from the South,
just like Elvis.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.515
Well..

05:50.517 --> 05:52.584
...at least I got his watch.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.987
[instrumental music]

05:55.989 --> 05:58.357
[Willie screaming]

05:59.860 --> 06:02.227
Dad, what happened?

06:02.229 --> 06:05.497
I slipped on a banana peel.

06:05.499 --> 06:10.068
I don't know why people
find that so amusing.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.971
[laughs]
Let me help you.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.373
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.842
I was just thinking
of a joke I heard

06:16.844 --> 06:19.144
on a different world.

06:19.146 --> 06:22.080
No, really, there was one.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.315
[chuckles]

06:23.317 --> 06:25.884
Three loaves of bread.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.886
At least he's cutting down.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.925
How did he get peanut butter
on the smoke detector?

06:37.097 --> 06:39.464
I'll clean this up.

06:39.466 --> 06:42.667
I'll go have a word
with hurricane Skippy.

06:49.943 --> 06:54.212
ALF, there are peanut butter
handprints all over the kitchen.

06:54.214 --> 06:57.349
Each of them has four fingers.

06:57.351 --> 06:58.884
Your comment?

06:58.886 --> 07:02.821
I have no recollection
of that event.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.991
Look, Willie, I've been thinking
about this Aaron King thing.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.359
And you're right.

07:07.361 --> 07:10.061
I can't go around saying
he's Elvis without proof.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.764
- Good.
- So I got proof.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.466
Listen to this.

07:16.003 --> 07:19.704
(man on tape)
'Huh? It's the middle
of the night, man.'

07:19.706 --> 07:22.541
'Who is this?'

07:22.543 --> 07:25.677
That doesn't sound anything
like Elvis Presley.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.615
But wait till
I play it backwards.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.719
[gibberish]

07:37.057 --> 07:39.891
- See?
- See what?

07:39.893 --> 07:44.029
That's exactly what
Elvis sounded like backwards..

07:44.031 --> 07:45.964
...in his later years.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.401
And when did you call Mr. King

07:49.403 --> 07:51.837
to get this
overwhelming evidence?

07:51.839 --> 07:55.340
- 3:00 a.m.
- You woke him up?

07:55.342 --> 07:56.741
Exhibit number two

07:56.743 --> 08:00.078
fresh from Aaron King's
trash can.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.548
Elvis' blue suede shoes.

08:05.519 --> 08:08.620
Those are red corduroy slippers.

08:08.622 --> 08:12.624
He changed the color and fabric
to protect himself

08:12.626 --> 08:15.594
from garbage-scavenging fans.

08:17.130 --> 08:20.398
- Like you?
- Exactly.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.667
Exhibit number three..

08:23.871 --> 08:25.971
...Elvis' lyrics.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.206
Listen to this hidden message.

08:28.208 --> 08:33.712
"Since my baby left me,
I found a new place to dwell."

08:33.714 --> 08:35.380
That's "Down At The End
Of Lonely Street"

08:35.382 --> 08:37.649
not next door to the Ochmonek's.

08:39.253 --> 08:41.953
Okay. But here's the clincher.

08:41.955 --> 08:47.459
If you re-arrange the letters
in Elvis Aaron Presley

08:47.461 --> 08:51.329
they spell..

08:51.331 --> 08:55.400
...Presley Lives Nora.

08:58.038 --> 09:02.574
Now, all we have to do
is find this Nora chick.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.075
You've convinced me, ALF.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.343
We are living two doors down

09:05.345 --> 09:06.878
the street from Elvis Presley

09:06.880 --> 09:11.883
and Raquel is Janis Joplin
and Trevor is Buddy Holly.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.419
That'll be the day.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.354
Look, Willie,
just wait till he gets here.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.290
Then you'll find out for sure.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.457
Wait till who gets here?

09:19.459 --> 09:21.893
Oh, uh, did I forget to mention

09:21.895 --> 09:26.798
when I called Mr. King, I said
we had a fruit basket for him?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.600
Yes.

09:28.602 --> 09:32.137
And, uh,
did I also forget to mention

09:32.139 --> 09:36.308
he'll be here
any minute to pick it up?

09:36.310 --> 09:38.376
Yes.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.045
I'm so forgetful.

09:40.047 --> 09:43.315
I should've tied a string
around my finger.

09:43.317 --> 09:45.784
Oh, I did.

09:45.786 --> 09:49.654
Gee, forgot all about that.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.389
What am I supposed to do
when Mr. King

09:51.391 --> 09:53.892
asks for his fruit basket?

09:53.894 --> 09:55.160
No problem.

09:55.162 --> 09:59.164
I ordered one over the phone.

09:59.166 --> 10:02.400
Dad, we have a visitor.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.936
Send him in.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.706
Now, look, Willie,
when this guy gets here

10:07.708 --> 10:12.210
monitor him
for Elvis-like behavior.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.579
What would you have me do?

10:14.581 --> 10:18.416
See if these make him salivate.

10:18.418 --> 10:19.651
What are they?

10:19.653 --> 10:21.586
These are deep-fried
peanut butter

10:21.588 --> 10:23.154
and banana sandwiches.

10:23.156 --> 10:28.326
Elvis loved them.
He could eat 20 a day.

10:28.328 --> 10:31.062
And you think he's still alive?

10:31.064 --> 10:32.564
(Lynn)
'Dad.'

10:40.540 --> 10:42.841
- Dad, this is Mr. King.
- Morning.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.376
Morning, I'm-I'm Willie Tanner.

10:44.378 --> 10:48.213
Uh, Mr. King says we have
a basket of fruit for him.

10:48.215 --> 10:51.383
Yes, it's something we do
for all our new neighbors now.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.485
You call them at 3:00 a.m. too?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.688
I'm terribly sorry. I..

10:56.690 --> 10:59.124
I guess I'm still
on daylight savings time.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.625
From Melbourne.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.362
Please, take these.

11:04.364 --> 11:08.566
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- That's mighty nice of you.

11:08.568 --> 11:10.568
Well, somebody took a bite
out of this apple.

11:12.806 --> 11:17.876
Pesky Mediterranean fruit flies,
bigger every year.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.178
We can get you another
basket of fruit.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.813
Oh, no, that's alright.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.748
But these wouldn't
happen to be peanut butter

11:23.750 --> 11:25.617
and banana sandwiches,
would they?

11:27.988 --> 11:31.256
Uh, yes, yes. Yes, they are.
Help-help yourself.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.924
Well, if you don't want 'em.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.627
Believe me,
I don't want them.

11:35.629 --> 11:37.896
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

11:42.202 --> 11:46.337
I used to have a pair
of slippers like these.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.807
Threw mine away though.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.241
See you.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.843
Uh, yeah. Nice to meet you.

11:51.845 --> 11:52.877
Bye bye.

11:55.382 --> 11:59.384
Elvis has left the building!

11:59.386 --> 12:03.655
- That was not Elvis Presley.
- Are you kidding?

12:03.657 --> 12:07.692
He was on that sandwich
like red beans on rice.

12:07.694 --> 12:11.696
ALF, he didn't seem like
Elvis to me either.

12:11.698 --> 12:14.099
Elvis was a brilliant actor.

12:14.101 --> 12:17.368
He could play anything
from a singing race car driver

12:17.370 --> 12:19.971
to a singing deep sea diver.

12:21.641 --> 12:24.342
Even if this man were
Elvis Presley

12:24.344 --> 12:28.847
and I assure you he's not,
he'd never admit it.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.049
I bet I can get it out of him.

12:32.686 --> 12:35.587
Leave the man alone!

12:35.589 --> 12:38.490
Leave him alone!

12:38.492 --> 12:40.792
So what are you saying,
leave the man alone?

12:50.203 --> 12:53.271
I won't rest till I prove
this man is Elvis Presley.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.875
[yawning]

12:56.877 --> 12:59.010
But first,
I think I'll take a nap.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.281
[instrumental music]

13:32.412 --> 13:34.612
[music continues]

13:45.358 --> 13:49.828
Either he's Elvis, or Priscilla
had a heck of a lawn sale.

13:53.567 --> 13:54.899
[instrumental music]

14:10.617 --> 14:12.817

14:36.276 --> 14:38.710
What the heck are you?

14:38.712 --> 14:41.012
I ain't nothin'
but a hound dog.

14:43.850 --> 14:46.751
Hound dogs don't talk.

14:46.753 --> 14:49.187
Neither do dead singers.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.889
Say what?

14:50.891 --> 14:53.725
You're Elvis Presley.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.561
I knew it! I knew it!

14:56.563 --> 14:58.596
I'm not Elvis Presley.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.900
Right and I'm not an alien.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.902
Wait a minute.
I remember you.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.204
You're that talkin' monkey
I saw in Vegas.

15:06.206 --> 15:10.642
Vegas? You've been to Vegas?
That proves it!

15:10.644 --> 15:14.779
- Proves what?
- That you're Elvis.

15:14.781 --> 15:18.216
Wait a minute.
Let's get back to who you are.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.918
Or what you are.

15:19.920 --> 15:23.421
Hey, I'll have you know
that I'm a superior being

15:23.423 --> 15:25.657
from the Planet Melmac.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.692
There's no Planet Melmac.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.360
Well, not anymore.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.896
That's why I'm here.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.431
Can I pet you?

15:35.802 --> 15:37.769
Only above the waist.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.878
Man!

15:46.880 --> 15:49.180
Are you trying to tell me
you're from outer space?

15:49.182 --> 15:52.617
Yeah, yeah,
but now I live down the block.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.519
My friends call me ALF.

15:57.190 --> 16:01.326
Boy, "The Enquirer" would sure
love a photo of this.

16:01.328 --> 16:05.330
Elvis Meets Creature
From Space.

16:05.332 --> 16:10.401
But don't let all this stuff
fool you. I'm not Elvis.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.337
I'm just a collector.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.438
I understand.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.740
Hey, we're both
in the same boat.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.076
We're fugitives from fame.

16:18.078 --> 16:21.412
You, me and Debbie Allen.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.816
I can't be Elvis. I'm alive.
He's dead.

16:24.818 --> 16:29.020
Hey, look, I didn't expect you
to admit that you're alive.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.621
Come on, be reasonable.

16:30.623 --> 16:34.158
Why would somebody like Elvis
wanna pretend he was dead?

16:34.160 --> 16:38.563
I figure you want to be an
average Joe in an average town

16:38.565 --> 16:43.001
with an average fleet
of pink Cadillac's.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.736
But your fans wouldn't let you.

16:44.738 --> 16:48.706
So you booked that big gig
into rock and roll heaven.

16:48.708 --> 16:52.944
What do you aliens do all day?
Look for dead celebrities?

16:52.946 --> 16:55.480
I'm so tired of that stereotype.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.450
Aliens have many interests.

16:59.452 --> 17:05.056
We sit around the house.
We eat. We watch TV.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.625
You sound more like Elvis
than I do.

17:07.627 --> 17:10.528
Hey, hey, why don't you
ring up Ann-Margret

17:10.530 --> 17:11.729
and get her over here?

17:11.731 --> 17:13.931
Oh, sure, I'll just hop over
to Graceland

17:13.933 --> 17:15.266
and pick up my Rolodex.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.801
[knock on door]
Whoever that is

17:16.803 --> 17:18.369
don't tell 'em I'm here.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.805
Uh, unless it's somebody
who knows me.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.774
But you'd have no way
of knowing that

17:22.776 --> 17:24.442
unless we work out a code.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.477
How about I just
don't let 'em in?

17:27.680 --> 17:29.080
Good thinking.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.719
- Howdy, ma'am.
- Hello.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.187
Uh, we haven't officially met.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.689
I'm Raquel Ochmonek.
I live next door.

17:38.691 --> 17:43.528
Oh, right. I didn't recognize
without the binoculars.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.563
I, uh, brought you
some pot roast.

17:45.565 --> 17:49.033
It's Sylvester Stallone's
favorite.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.668
That's mighty neighborly of you.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.638
If you'd like, I could,
uh, heat it up for you.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.206
It'd only take a minute.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.541
Oh, don't trouble yourself,
ma'am.

17:56.543 --> 17:59.977
- I've already had my dinner.
- I know.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.779
So, uh, why don't you
just let me

18:01.781 --> 18:04.182
put it in the freezer for you?

18:04.184 --> 18:06.017
Well, to tell you the truth,
ma'am, I'm..

18:06.019 --> 18:08.386
You caught me in kind
of a compromising position.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.021
What do you mean?

18:10.023 --> 18:12.757
Well, I'm not exactly alone.
If you get my drift.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.726
[gasps]
Really?

18:15.728 --> 18:20.031
I didn't observe any second
parties entering the premises.

18:20.033 --> 18:23.000
So you won't think I'm rude
if I don't invite you in?

18:23.002 --> 18:24.969
Oh, of course not.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.071
Just keep playing
those Elvis records.

18:27.073 --> 18:31.075
- No girl can resist that voice.
- I know.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.019
Man,
that Raquel is one nosy gal.

18:42.021 --> 18:45.656
I can't even sneeze without her
handing me a Kleenex.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.091
That proves it!

18:47.093 --> 18:48.593
Elvis couldn't sneeze without

18:48.595 --> 18:51.896
somebody handing him a Kleenex.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.298
ALF, I've had it
with this Elvis thing.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.067
Look, I'll prove it to you.

19:06.713 --> 19:09.413
¶ It's down at the end
of lonely street ¶

19:09.415 --> 19:11.716
¶ It's heartbreak hotel.. ¶¶

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

19:12.986 --> 19:15.586
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

19:15.588 --> 19:19.423
No wonder your baby left you if
you've been singing like that.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.058
Stinkaroni!

19:22.529 --> 19:25.296
Now, are you convinced
I'm not Elvis?

19:25.298 --> 19:27.832
You just need
a little more practice.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.734
You've been dead for a while.

19:31.804 --> 19:35.273
Look, I wish I was Elvis, buddy

19:35.275 --> 19:37.842
but I'm just a truck driver
from Tupelo.

19:37.844 --> 19:42.113
And that's as close as I'll ever
get to being the king.

19:42.115 --> 19:44.215
In fact..

19:44.217 --> 19:47.185
...Aaron King
isn't even my real name.

19:47.187 --> 19:51.722
I changed it
from Clarence Williams III.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.559
A truck driver? Right.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.161
Clarence? Come on.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.664
They could put bamboo shoots
under my toenails

19:59.666 --> 20:03.000
and I'll still say you're
Clarence, the truck driver.

20:03.002 --> 20:07.104
But in my heart,
I'll always know you are Elvis.

20:07.106 --> 20:10.074
[instrumental music]
You are Elvis.

20:10.076 --> 20:13.511
You are Elvis.

20:13.513 --> 20:17.782
You...are...Elvis.

Oh. Oh.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.621
Huh?

20:23.623 --> 20:25.022
Oh!

20:25.024 --> 20:26.591
Where's the king?

20:26.593 --> 20:30.127
We don't have a king.
This is America.

20:30.129 --> 20:34.599
I mean Elvis.
I was just talking to him.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.767
You were sleeping.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.737
Oh, you mean, I was just
dreaming that Elvis was alive?

20:39.739 --> 20:44.842
No, he was alive, but that
was before he was dead.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.311
Don't mess with a groggy alien.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.880
Come on, ALF,
mom's got lunch ready.

20:49.882 --> 20:53.251
Great. A hunk of burnin' food.

[instrumental music]

20:56.589 --> 20:59.590
[instrumental music]

20:59.592 --> 21:01.759
But you know what he said
that convinced me

21:01.761 --> 21:05.363
even more than ever
that he's Elvis?

21:05.365 --> 21:06.797
What?

21:06.799 --> 21:11.102
He said, "I'm not Elvis."

21:11.104 --> 21:13.471
Who else,
but Elvis would say that?

21:14.974 --> 21:17.508
Almost anyone.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.310
I can't wait any longer, Kate.

21:19.312 --> 21:23.547
I've got to go over there
and get conclusive proof.

21:23.549 --> 21:25.283
ALF..

21:25.285 --> 21:28.619
...let's assume for a moment
and just a moment..

21:28.621 --> 21:31.589
that Aaron King
is Elvis Presley.

21:31.591 --> 21:34.959
What do you think
he'd want you to do?

21:34.961 --> 21:38.162
He'd want me to track him down,
hound him and force him

21:38.164 --> 21:40.598
to hang out with me.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.699
Guess again.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.537
He'd want me
to leave him alone.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.372
That's right.

21:48.374 --> 21:50.875
- Give him his privacy.
- That's right!

21:50.877 --> 21:55.579
And order the complete set
of Elvis memorial shoe trees.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.214
That's wrong.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.383
(Raquel)
'Yoo-hoo! Kate!'

21:59.385 --> 22:00.584
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:00.586 --> 22:04.121
[knock on door]
Hi, Raquel. Come on in.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.290
Kate, you'll never guess
what happened.

22:06.292 --> 22:08.392
Aaron King moved out
in the middle of the night.

22:08.394 --> 22:10.928
- Oh, isn't that strange?
- That's not all that's strange.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.864
I don't think that man
was who he claimed to be.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.800
Oh, not you too.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.468
- What?
- I mean, what?

22:17.470 --> 22:20.604
Well, he always kept
the blinds drawn.

22:20.606 --> 22:22.973
He always wore sunglasses
when it wasn't even sunny

22:22.975 --> 22:26.243
and I saw him loading two
or three guitars into his car.

22:26.245 --> 22:30.114
[scoffs]
Raquel,
I know what you're thinking

22:30.116 --> 22:33.818
and he's been dead a long time.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.953
I thought that too at first.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.488
But you mark my words, Kate

22:37.490 --> 22:40.758
that man who lived next door
to us was Buddy Holly.

22:46.099 --> 22:48.099
Boy, is she gullible.

22:48.101 --> 22:49.667
Everybody knows
that Buddy Holly

22:49.669 --> 22:52.670
runs a bait and tackle shop
