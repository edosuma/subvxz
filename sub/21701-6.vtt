WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:08.267 --> 00:09.767
Ding-dong!

00:09.833 --> 00:12.200
We are back!
(cheering)

00:12.267 --> 00:16.200
This time things
are gonna be pure crazy!

00:19.867 --> 00:21.467
Let's get fucking mortal.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.833
Yay!

00:25.900 --> 00:27.267
Fuck off.
Fucking Divvy.

00:28.133 --> 00:29.200
Yes!

00:29.267 --> 00:31.567
(glass smashes, moaning)

00:31.633 --> 00:34.667
We're gonna be the radgiest
we've ever been.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.567
(cheering)

00:37.633 --> 00:38.700
What the hell?

00:42.200 --> 00:44.633
Ah, fucking yessa!

00:44.700 --> 00:47.333
Aaron!
Fucking mug!

00:47.400 --> 00:49.967
It's gonna be the maddest
of mad tings.

00:50.033 --> 00:51.900
Fucking God!

00:53.633 --> 00:54.867
Oh, my God.

00:56.367 --> 00:58.167
This is amazing.

00:59.300 --> 01:02.400
One big fucked-up family.

01:02.467 --> 01:03.733
Cheers!

01:03.800 --> 01:05.633
(laughter)

01:07.067 --> 01:09.800
Scotty and Marty won't be
returning
to the house.

01:09.867 --> 01:12.767
Scotty and Marty aren't coming
back?
What the fuck?

01:12.833 --> 01:15.233
I'm sending you to Rome!

01:15.300 --> 01:16.600
(cheering)

01:16.667 --> 01:18.733
I can't fucking wait.

01:19.933 --> 01:22.233
Abbie is looking pretty fit.

01:22.300 --> 01:24.433
Oh, my God, hi!

01:24.500 --> 01:27.233
I'm back!
What happened to Abbie, Gary?

01:31.867 --> 01:34.833
It's Mission: Cockblock Gary.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.833
What the fuck is going on?

01:36.900 --> 01:39.933
What would they do if I pulled
Abbie?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.433
(shouting)

01:44.200 --> 01:47.233
I want it to stay like this
and not overcomplicate things.

01:47.300 --> 01:50.400
What would you say is actually
going on? I would say dating.

01:53.467 --> 01:55.633
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.367
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:58.433 --> 02:00.633
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:00.700 --> 02:03.800
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

02:03.867 --> 02:05.900
I'm preened to perfection.

02:05.967 --> 02:08.300
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:08.366 --> 02:11.133
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:11.200 --> 02:14.133
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.167
My quiff's pure lethal
and my banter is pure naughty.

02:17.233 --> 02:19.233
(all) Geordie Shore, wey-aye!

02:26.000 --> 02:27.700
(groaning)

02:30.133 --> 02:35.000
I've woke up this morning
with a mouth like a badger's
arse.

02:35.067 --> 02:38.500
Last night was crazy. What was
all that cockblocking about?

02:38.567 --> 02:40.400
Morning, everybody.
Morning.

02:40.467 --> 02:43.200
Mission: Cockblock Gary was
complete.

02:43.267 --> 02:45.433
I'm so glad the plan worked.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.267
I've managed to keep Gary
away from Elettra

02:48.333 --> 02:50.133
and even got a cheeky neck-on.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.933
Listen, my boy Gary played you.
He played you.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.733
These girls don't know
what they're talking about.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.467
Gary knew what they were up to
and he played them.

03:11.767 --> 03:14.333
Don't make Abbie
feel like she's being used.

03:14.400 --> 03:18.767
Nathan thinks Gary is the
winner,
but I actually don't know who
wins.

03:18.833 --> 03:21.733
I don't know who the winner is.
I'm confused myself.

03:26.567 --> 03:27.933
This is nice, isn't it?

03:28.000 --> 03:31.167
Things are great with me and
Marnie
and we had a wicked night,

03:31.233 --> 03:33.233
but I don't think
we're the only ones.

03:34.533 --> 03:39.433
Chloe and Abbie were playing
games,
so I went to bed by myself.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.000
Of course I necked on with Abbie
but howay man,

03:42.067 --> 03:45.300
I don't want Elettra to find out
cos there could be a chance.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.400
Did you kiss Abbie last night?
No.

03:47.467 --> 03:48.867
Swear down?
Swear down.

03:48.933 --> 03:52.267
Gary Beadle, you are full of
shit.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.567
There's no way that you didn't
neck on. Everyone seen it.

03:55.633 --> 03:58.067
I didn't realise
that you were such a bad liar.

03:59.233 --> 04:01.633
We did kiss, fuck it.
We had one kiss.

04:02.633 --> 04:06.167
If it was a normal night,
I would have been with Elettra.

04:06.233 --> 04:08.433
I'm so scared about chlamydia,

04:08.500 --> 04:11.567
I don't want to sleep with
someone
that kiss another girl.

04:11.633 --> 04:13.600
I want to do something wicked.

04:13.667 --> 04:16.267
Onion rings.
Onion rings? What?

04:16.333 --> 04:17.733
(laughs)

04:17.800 --> 04:21.666
Howay, Gaz. I think Elettra's
hungry.
Let's get some scran on the go.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.733
Gary, you were fucking smashed.
Was I?

04:25.800 --> 04:28.167
Showing off in front of Abbie.
(phone rings)

04:28.233 --> 04:30.600
Phone!
Oh, no!

04:30.667 --> 04:33.300
Shit, I always forget
we are here to work.

04:33.367 --> 04:35.667
I know exactly
who this is going to be.

04:38.533 --> 04:40.833
Oh, we're having a pure belter
time.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.567
Yay!

04:49.533 --> 04:50.800
Costumes? Ooh.

04:50.867 --> 04:54.267
We've got work tonight. I'm just
happy that Elettra is here.

04:54.333 --> 04:57.567
None of those Italians are going
to understand a word we say.

04:57.633 --> 04:58.700
"Ciao, Chloe."

04:58.767 --> 05:00.333
Ciao!
What'd she say?

05:00.400 --> 05:02.900
Tonight we've got an event,

05:02.967 --> 05:05.400
showing the Romans
how to party Geordie style.

05:05.467 --> 05:07.133
I'm so hungover this morning,

05:07.200 --> 05:09.800
fucking hell,
I just want to go to bed.

05:09.867 --> 05:12.667
I'm excited cos all the Roman
lads
are so fucking fit.

05:12.733 --> 05:14.967
You can't neck on
with the clients, Chloe.

05:15.033 --> 05:18.067
I'm necking on tonight at work
and Anna can fuck off.

05:18.133 --> 05:21.467
Rome, lock up your sons because
Chloe Ferry is coming for you.

05:21.533 --> 05:24.633
We've only got one day left.
We should do something wicked,

05:24.700 --> 05:27.833
but nice and chilled,
so I've organised a boat tour.

05:27.900 --> 05:30.833
Yeah!
It goes through Rome. We can
chill.

05:30.900 --> 05:33.700
Gaz has organised a tour of Rome
down the river.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.267
With work tonight,
it sounds fucking amazing.

05:36.333 --> 05:37.867
Today will be good, I promise!

05:38.900 --> 05:41.500
Let's go! Come on, everybody.

05:45.267 --> 05:48.033
I am so buzzing for this yacht.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.600
I cannot wait to just chill out
and get a nice tan

05:50.667 --> 05:52.367
and even have a cocktail.

05:52.433 --> 05:56.000
Maybe the river is like the
River
Tyne, like our river in
Newcastle.

05:56.067 --> 05:58.333
Oh, my God, that is so fucking
cool.

06:01.467 --> 06:04.567
Gary, what is that? That's a
dinghy.
No, it's a raft.

06:04.633 --> 06:08.200
Is he having a laugh? I thought
we were going on a fucking
yacht.

06:08.267 --> 06:10.067
You said we were going on a
boat!

06:10.133 --> 06:12.767
Oh, my God,
and we're swimming in the sewer.

06:12.833 --> 06:15.533
We are swimming
in the fucking sewers.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.400
It's biodegradable.
Everyone is super hungover.

06:18.467 --> 06:22.067
This is the worst idea you've
ever
had in your entire life, Gary.

06:25.300 --> 06:28.400
This river is full of fucking
shite.

06:28.467 --> 06:31.100
We're in Rome
so why the hell were we boat
rafting

06:31.167 --> 06:33.167
when there's plenty
more things to do?

06:36.367 --> 06:37.367
This is shit.

06:37.433 --> 06:41.167
The last thing I want to do is
row
a boat that goes two miles an
hour.

06:41.233 --> 06:42.533
The fuck?

06:43.733 --> 06:45.700
What are you doing?
Sunbathing.

06:45.767 --> 06:48.300
Gary, this was a fucking shit
idea.

06:48.367 --> 06:51.067
Heave! Heave! Heave!

06:51.133 --> 06:54.733
My arms are fucked.
Get me off here now.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.467
There's my fucking sites.
You can see things

06:57.533 --> 06:59.467
now we're getting to Rome.

06:59.533 --> 07:02.567
That red building there.
Can we just get a taxi?

07:02.633 --> 07:05.867
I try to give
these little fuckers a day out

07:05.933 --> 07:09.033
and all they do is moan.

07:09.100 --> 07:12.167
Let's fucking get out of here.
I'm fucking bored shitless.

07:12.233 --> 07:14.333
Absolute fucking shite.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.000
Another five minutes of paddling
and we would be going through
Rome,

07:18.067 --> 07:20.300
but do you know what?
Let's get off early.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.833
I'm so fucking glad we're off,
you know?

07:26.900 --> 07:29.933
I didn't think it was going to
be
like a little boat.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.967
It was literally a dinghy.

07:32.033 --> 07:35.567
Has Gary been flirting with
Elettra?
I haven't been keeping an eye.

07:35.633 --> 07:38.133
Do you know what,
he's done it to both of you.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.333
I've seen him looking at you.
Abbie, I think he fancies you.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.033
Do yous?

07:43.100 --> 07:44.967
I do think Gary is good looking,

07:45.033 --> 07:48.933
but whether he fancies me or
not,
I do think he's playing a game.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.933
I know Gary. I've knew him for
years. He's 100% attracted to
you.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.167
If Gary seen you in a club
in Newcastle, he'd pull you.

07:56.233 --> 07:59.667
I know Gary started with Abbie
as a game to begin with,

07:59.733 --> 08:01.567
but the more the girls explain
it,

08:01.633 --> 08:04.967
I can't help but think that
he might actually like the girl.

08:05.033 --> 08:07.100
Did you kiss him last night?
Yeah.

08:07.167 --> 08:08.500
Did you enjoy it?
Yeah.

08:08.567 --> 08:13.133
I do believe that Abbie is
getting
that little bit of feeling for
Gary

08:13.200 --> 08:16.333
and I'm just scared in case
it turns into something bigger.

08:17.933 --> 08:19.900
Have you spoken to Abbie today?
Nah.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.667
You enjoy a flirt.
I was building her confidence.

08:22.733 --> 08:24.967
Gaz.
I didn't think she'd take it
serious.

08:25.033 --> 08:26.133
Why all the games?

08:26.200 --> 08:29.533
At least Abbie's got an excuse.
She's only bloody 19.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.667
Come on, Gary, sort it out.

08:31.733 --> 08:34.667
Does she know last night
was taking the piss out of her?

08:34.732 --> 08:36.799
You were playing her
at her own game.

08:36.866 --> 08:40.500
Exactly, if they want to try and
play
with me, I'll play with them.

08:40.567 --> 08:42.767
The cockblocking
was funny at the start,

08:42.832 --> 08:45.933
but now it's just getting
annoying.
It has to stop!

08:46.000 --> 08:48.200
If it happens again,
someone has to say.

08:48.267 --> 08:49.833
I'll be like, "Give it a rest."

08:49.900 --> 08:53.467
I think we should get Nathan
drunk
and be like, "Tell her, Nathan."

08:53.533 --> 08:56.733
It's past the point of funny.
We've got work tonight as well.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.500
Elettra tonight, work,
you, all the talking.

09:00.567 --> 09:02.133
No.
Yeah, cos you're Italian.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.567
You're Italian.
We play the games, you just
talk.

09:05.633 --> 09:06.933
What is the game?

09:07.000 --> 09:10.800
I swear, trying to talk to this
girl
is like getting blood out of a
stone.

09:10.867 --> 09:12.667
But what is not to love?

09:12.733 --> 09:15.100
Come on, Letti.
Letti, Lessi.

09:15.167 --> 09:18.700
I am so fucking tired after
that.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.267
I've had enough.
My arms are killing,

09:21.333 --> 09:24.233
my sunburn's killing.
I need to get back to the villa.

09:24.300 --> 09:27.933
Howay, let wuh gan then, you
freaks.
Let's start getting ready!

09:31.700 --> 09:35.000
It's been wicked. I think the
clubs
have been really good here.

09:35.067 --> 09:38.700
It's our last night, I think
we should all just get fucked.

09:40.133 --> 09:42.033
I'm buzzing for tonight.

09:45.167 --> 09:49.400
We get back and the costumes
for tonight are here already.

09:49.467 --> 09:51.067
I need a fucking hairdryer.

09:51.133 --> 09:55.167
Normally Anna's costumes are
shit,
but these are actually wicked!

09:57.733 --> 09:58.767
Oh!

10:01.600 --> 10:04.367
I think the outfits
look so good on the boys.

10:04.433 --> 10:06.833
Who do you think looks best?
I think Nathan!

10:06.900 --> 10:09.800
Eh? What? Marnie,
no sex for you tonight.

10:09.867 --> 10:12.033
Because he's built like a Roman.

10:12.100 --> 10:15.433
I'm the best in the fancy dress,
and obviously I am.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.667
I look fucking good in anything.

10:17.733 --> 10:19.667
Are you going to pull at work?

10:19.733 --> 10:22.967
There will be fit birds.
It's Geordie Tours, there always
is.

10:23.033 --> 10:26.233
My plan is, go to work. If
there's
any fit birds I'll crack on.

10:26.300 --> 10:29.633
If not, my fall-back plan
is Abbie and Elettra.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.367
What could possibly go wrong?

10:31.433 --> 10:33.567
If a lad came in
and Chloe was cracking on,

10:33.633 --> 10:35.367
I'd joke for about ten minutes.

10:35.433 --> 10:38.300
I wouldn't drag it out
for the whole time we're in
Rome.

10:38.367 --> 10:41.967
So, I think if she does it again
and she keeps doing it for
attention,

10:42.033 --> 10:44.033
I think someone has to say
something.

10:44.100 --> 10:46.333
Nath, that's where you come in.
Erm...

10:46.400 --> 10:47.467
(laughter)

10:47.533 --> 10:50.533
Everyone is pissed off
with Chloe playing stupid games

10:50.600 --> 10:53.200
and getting involved
in everyone's business.

10:53.267 --> 10:55.967
Tonight me and Marnie
will have to say something.

10:56.033 --> 10:58.800
If it does continue,
we will speak to her as friends

10:58.867 --> 11:00.900
and just say, "Look, just stop
now."

11:00.967 --> 11:04.467
Obviously I love Chloe to bits.
She's still one of my best
friends,

11:04.533 --> 11:07.900
but if I have to talk to her I
will,
cos I know she would do the
same.

11:10.233 --> 11:13.933
What are Italian boys like?
We heard they have little willy.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.233
Yeah.
Yeah?

11:15.300 --> 11:18.667
If you want a big man boo,
Italian boy, uh-uh-uh-uh.

11:18.733 --> 11:20.133
Really?

11:20.200 --> 11:22.400
There's nothing worse
than a small willy.

11:22.467 --> 11:25.067
I will stick
to my fucking vibrator, thank
you.

11:25.133 --> 11:27.067
What about Italian men kiss?

11:27.133 --> 11:29.967
Not very good, are they?
She's not selling it to us.

11:30.033 --> 11:33.700
So, all Italian men have small
dicks
and they're shit kissers?

11:33.767 --> 11:34.800
Yeah.

11:34.867 --> 11:36.900
We're in for a treat, aren't we?

11:36.967 --> 11:39.100
Fuck me, Elettra is picky.

11:39.167 --> 11:41.300
The Italians are mint

11:41.367 --> 11:45.233
and I've seen some proper
fitties,
so I am going to crack on
tonight.

11:45.300 --> 11:46.400
Are we ready?

11:46.467 --> 11:47.500
Yeah!
Last night!

11:47.567 --> 11:49.233
(cheering)
Come on!

11:50.633 --> 11:53.267
Let's get to work
and fucking smash it.

11:56.333 --> 11:57.700
Hello, everybody!

11:57.767 --> 11:59.467
Let's fucking have it.

11:59.533 --> 12:03.167
I'm deep throating, I'm choking!
Hello!

12:07.167 --> 12:09.033
Sophie is making me fucking
sick.

12:09.100 --> 12:11.067
(retches)
Oh, my God!

12:11.133 --> 12:13.133
(all) Geordie Shore, wey-aye!

12:16.000 --> 12:16.200
.

12:18.700 --> 12:18.900
.

12:27.133 --> 12:29.267
Hello, everybody!

12:29.333 --> 12:33.067
Tonight is our last night in
Rome
and we're going to smash work

12:33.133 --> 12:35.433
and go out
with a fucking massive bang.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.833
All right?
Nice to meet you.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.467
I'm going to dive
straight in there, say hello.

12:40.533 --> 12:41.833
Let's fucking have it.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.600
Mwah. Mwah.

12:43.667 --> 12:46.500
We're going to show all yous
how to party.

12:46.567 --> 12:49.333
Get in two lines.
Comprende? Understand?

12:49.400 --> 12:50.533
Two lines.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.000
Fucking hell,
this is really hard work.

12:53.067 --> 12:56.933
If we can get two fucking lines.
We need two lines, yeah?
Right...

12:57.000 --> 12:58.867
I fucking knew this would
happen.

12:58.933 --> 13:02.767
Let's take a different approach.
We'll just do it ourselves.

13:02.833 --> 13:05.500
One line. Two lines.

13:05.567 --> 13:08.233
Two lines, come on.
Line, line, line, line.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.467
Boy, girl, boy, girl.

13:09.533 --> 13:11.300
Face me. One line.

13:11.367 --> 13:15.067
It's going to be a race, OK?
Like this, bang. Yeah?

13:15.133 --> 13:18.333
No hands.
Big, fat dick.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.667
Italian men are famous
for having little sausages,

13:21.733 --> 13:24.000
so we're going to make them
feel a lot better

13:24.067 --> 13:27.100
by passing this big,
humungous sausage.

13:27.167 --> 13:28.667
Dinosaur!

13:30.067 --> 13:32.933
Eh! No hands!

13:33.000 --> 13:34.833
Go on!

13:34.900 --> 13:37.000
(cheering, shouting)

13:39.100 --> 13:41.800
The first game was me
against Sophie and I win. Yes!

13:41.867 --> 13:45.300
The next game, suck the
spaghetti.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.667
(shouting, cheering)

13:51.800 --> 13:54.633
This spaghetti is way too
floppy.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.600
I need something a lot harder
in my mouth.

13:57.667 --> 14:00.400
Come on, Abbie, you can do it!
Spit it out!

14:00.467 --> 14:02.500
I'm deep throating, I'm choking.

14:02.567 --> 14:04.533
Next one.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.767
(cheering)

14:06.833 --> 14:09.000
This is going fucking fantastic.

14:09.067 --> 14:11.800
It's time for the last game.
Dance-off.

14:11.867 --> 14:14.967
It's a dance-off.
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

14:15.033 --> 14:16.800
You and you.

14:16.867 --> 14:19.400
(cheering, clapping)

14:27.833 --> 14:29.700
The Italians love us.

14:29.767 --> 14:33.500
Now Toon Tours in Rome
has been a success!

14:33.567 --> 14:35.233
(cheering)

14:36.633 --> 14:40.233
(chanting) Geordie Tours!
Geordie Tours! Geordie Tours!

14:40.300 --> 14:43.700
Howay, job done. I want to get
out
of these kegs and get to the
club.

14:45.167 --> 14:46.867
That was our best work ever.

14:46.933 --> 14:50.933
How did that go so well?
Let's get to the club!

14:56.500 --> 14:57.567
Yeah!

14:59.167 --> 15:01.733
The club is absolutely amazing.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.000
It's huge.
There's lights going off.

15:04.067 --> 15:06.200
It's like being in Ibiza.

15:09.233 --> 15:11.533
(cheering)

15:15.533 --> 15:18.900
It's our last night in Rome
and I need to neck on with a
Roman,

15:18.967 --> 15:22.067
cos so far I've only
necked on with Gary.

15:22.133 --> 15:24.867
I'm young and I'm single
and I'm on holiday.

15:39.033 --> 15:42.900
I'm talking to Gary about the
kiss. I'm so glad it's not
awkward.

15:42.967 --> 15:46.633
We're both on the same page and
we can both have a laugh about
it.

15:51.633 --> 15:54.233
This is fun. I'm not Scott.
We're having a laugh.

15:54.300 --> 15:57.167
When we get back it might
continue,
it might not.

15:57.233 --> 15:58.667
Just enjoy yourself.

16:00.300 --> 16:05.500
Do you know what? These two are
cute. I think that I'm Team
Gabbie.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.567
I thought Abbie was out here
to pull a Roman.

16:15.633 --> 16:18.033
She is just more bothered about
Gary.

16:23.867 --> 16:27.033
I know I said I wanted to neck
on
with a Roman,

16:27.100 --> 16:30.233
but it's good to know
I've got Gary as a backup plan.

16:36.567 --> 16:39.533
Me, Elettra and Abbie
are scouring the club for boys

16:39.600 --> 16:43.400
and I see someone
who looks like Chris Brown.
Hello!

16:46.667 --> 16:51.233
Finally! One of the girls
has necked on with a real Roman!

16:55.433 --> 16:59.000
I've had a neck-on with a Roman,
but he's not coming to the VIP
like.

16:59.067 --> 17:01.433
He needs to be
a very important person!

17:07.500 --> 17:10.067
Marnie and Aaron
are getting along so well.

17:10.133 --> 17:12.133
I'm glad to see
they're in a good place.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.867
I just hope it continues
cos I love seeing them together.

17:25.532 --> 17:27.733
Chloe's happy
now that she's necked on.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.467
So maybe now is a good time
to have that chat.

17:38.133 --> 17:40.600
What the fuck
is Nathan banging on about?

17:40.667 --> 17:43.400
Why is he so bothered?
It was just a laugh.

17:43.467 --> 17:45.300
It was Gary we were
cockblocking!

17:50.967 --> 17:54.200
Chloe's now changed the subject
to arguing about me and her.

17:54.267 --> 17:56.533
This is why me and Chloe argue.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.533
She shouts like a dickhead
rather than listening to me.

18:07.567 --> 18:09.500
I'm worried about Nathan and
Chloe.

18:09.567 --> 18:13.367
They've been best friends. All
they
do now is argue. What's going
on?

18:21.567 --> 18:24.133
Sorry, Chloe,
you're on your own on this one.

18:32.267 --> 18:35.333
If you want to get personal,
I fucking will too.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.167
Everyone thinks you're
an attention-seeking twat.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.867
How the hell am I better
than anyone else?

18:45.933 --> 18:48.900
That has upset us
cos that is not true.

18:52.367 --> 18:56.200
Fucking hell, this is not
about cockblocking any more.

18:56.267 --> 18:59.900
Nathan and Chloe have clearly
got
some issues they need to sort
out.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.800
I'm so fuming about
what Nathan's just said.

19:05.867 --> 19:08.267
I'm going to find out
what everyone thinks.

19:15.900 --> 19:19.333
Nathan is a bit of a shit bag
and
he's hoyed everyone under the
bus.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.767
If I've got something to say to
Chloe, it will come from my
mouth.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.533
I hope everyone's opinion of me
doesn't change

19:37.600 --> 19:40.367
because I told Chloe the truth.
Someone had to do it,

19:40.433 --> 19:43.700
and, sadly, that was me
because I know Chloe the best.

19:48.967 --> 19:51.033
I totally get him
and I understand him.

19:51.100 --> 19:54.233
But, please, Nathan,
tonight isn't the night.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.100
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

19:58.967 --> 20:01.633
Chloe and Nathan might have
kicked off, but haway,

20:01.700 --> 20:04.433
that's not going to stop us
enjoying our last night.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.200
These clubs are getting
better and better.

20:09.267 --> 20:13.800
Even Aaron is dancing
and that never happens!

20:24.967 --> 20:27.867
We are all absolutely mortal

20:27.933 --> 20:31.067
and I'm worrying in case
we miss our flight tomorrow.

20:31.133 --> 20:33.200
Let's get home
and make sure we catch it.

20:37.733 --> 20:40.133
We went out and we had
a fucking amazing time.

20:40.200 --> 20:44.633
I'm sad that me and Chloe had
an argument, but these things
happen.

20:47.433 --> 20:49.433
I didn't think tonight
could get worse

20:49.500 --> 20:52.967
but now Marnie has thrown
up in the taxi, it fucking
stinks!

20:53.967 --> 20:58.333
What is going on with us?
Everyone is on a fucking whitey!

20:58.400 --> 21:00.567
(retching)

21:04.333 --> 21:06.300
Oh, my God!

21:06.367 --> 21:08.967
Watching Sophie be sick
is making me be sick

21:09.033 --> 21:11.067
and she's being sick
cos I'm being sick

21:11.133 --> 21:13.900
and this whole situation
is making me fucking sick.

21:13.967 --> 21:16.000
(coughing, retching)

21:24.100 --> 21:25.767
(retches)

21:35.700 --> 21:37.200
Ah, you daft cunt.

21:39.567 --> 21:42.767
Rome has done something bad to
me.

21:42.833 --> 21:47.400
We get back to the villa
and Rome has absolutely ruined
us.

21:47.467 --> 21:50.967
We've got an early flight, so
unfortunately it's straight to
bed.

21:51.033 --> 21:54.200
And unsurprisingly,
I'm going to bed alone again.

21:59.533 --> 22:00.900
Bye, Rome!

22:05.133 --> 22:08.733
We have been away for that long,
these ducks have been laying
eggs.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.067
Have you spoke?
Nah.

22:10.133 --> 22:11.500
I don't even know who he is.

22:11.567 --> 22:15.200
I feel like he hates us,
but I've done nothing wrong.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.267
(all) Geordie shore, wey-aye!

22:19.467 --> 22:19.667
.

22:22.200 --> 22:22.400
.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.667
What the fuck happened last
night?

22:41.733 --> 22:44.000
Sophie sounds like Marge
Simpson.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.733
The only thing that's changed
about me is I've grew up a bit,

22:57.800 --> 22:59.867
but I am still the same
person inside.

22:59.933 --> 23:01.567
My personality is the same.

23:01.633 --> 23:04.700
He's completely changed.
I don't think it's like that.

23:04.767 --> 23:08.433
Chloe and Nathan have got too
much
of a good friendship to throw
away

23:08.500 --> 23:10.833
over a stupid argument.

23:10.900 --> 23:14.000
Hopefully when we get back home
everything can get sorted,

23:14.067 --> 23:17.400
but for now I need to fucking
pack.

23:22.833 --> 23:24.933
I have no clothes on!

23:25.000 --> 23:26.533
You can sit next to me though.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.533
God, it is so early.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.800
The whole fucking Chloe thing.

23:30.867 --> 23:32.867
Someone had to say something.

23:32.933 --> 23:35.067
If it wasn't you
it would be someone else.

23:35.133 --> 23:36.933
She attacked me. She was like,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.400
"Everyone thinks
you talk to them like shit."

23:39.467 --> 23:41.233
"Everyone thinks this and that."

23:41.300 --> 23:44.100
"Bitch, you want to say
everyone thinks about me?"

23:44.167 --> 23:47.467
"I will tell you
what everyone thinks about you."

23:47.533 --> 23:49.100
You can tell Nathan hit a nerve

23:49.167 --> 23:52.567
because Chloe went round asking
every person what they said.

23:52.633 --> 23:55.667
They are best friends.
They need to sort their shit
out.

23:55.733 --> 23:59.200
I'm not arguing on a fucking
plane
while I am trapped in the air.

23:59.267 --> 24:02.633
I'd rather just wait
until I get back. Good God.

24:02.700 --> 24:05.867
Last night, I knew I was right
cos Chloe got defensive.

24:05.933 --> 24:07.367
As far as I'm concerned,

24:07.433 --> 24:10.000
I'm not speaking to that girl
until we get back.

24:10.067 --> 24:12.100
It's been an absolute pleasure.

24:12.167 --> 24:14.800
Aww.
I've really enjoyed your
company.

24:14.867 --> 24:17.800
I don't know what
I'm more happy about, going
back,

24:17.867 --> 24:22.200
or the fact I haven't got to try
and
have a conversation with
Elettra.

24:22.267 --> 24:26.900
Right, you need to move cos I'm
naked
as fuck and I need to pack. Come
on.

24:29.467 --> 24:31.367
Ah, your breath is ill.
(laughs)

24:31.433 --> 24:34.833
I'm sad to be going home cos me
and Marnie have had a mint time.

24:34.900 --> 24:37.333
I'm excited to carry
that back on in the Toon.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.833
How early is it?

24:38.900 --> 24:41.200
Bye, Elettra.
(all) Bye!

24:41.267 --> 24:43.867
Bye. Bye, bye.

24:43.933 --> 24:47.667
I'm going to miss these
bastards,
so, bye, motherfucker!

24:51.333 --> 24:54.467
Bye, Rome! Get me fucking home!

24:54.533 --> 24:57.667
Rome has been amazing,
but I have really missed
Newcastle.

24:57.733 --> 24:59.833
Get me home
and get me a fucking kebab.

25:00.767 --> 25:03.300
(car horn honks)
Fuck off!

25:03.367 --> 25:05.400
(all) Yay!

25:06.500 --> 25:08.900
We're back in the Toon!

25:08.967 --> 25:10.600
Oh, my God!

25:13.200 --> 25:15.733
Yous, that was a fucking good
trip,
wasn't it?

25:15.800 --> 25:19.500
I loved Rome. Mostly cos me and
Aaron enjoyed each other's
company.

25:19.567 --> 25:22.567
I hope it all stays the same
when we're back in Newcastle.

25:22.633 --> 25:25.267
What about you and Abbie
and the holiday romance?

25:31.000 --> 25:34.367
It was never awkward before,
but thanks, Sophie. It is now.

25:41.633 --> 25:43.700
(cheering)

25:45.067 --> 25:47.567
Hi, dining table! Hi, rhino!

25:47.633 --> 25:49.833
It feels good to be back.

25:49.900 --> 25:52.633
Straight upstairs, guys!
I love my home!

25:52.700 --> 25:54.800
Anna's been looking after the
ducks.

25:54.867 --> 25:57.100
I can't wait to see
how they've been doing.

25:57.167 --> 25:58.733
They're scared of us.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.433
Whoa!
Fucking eggs!

26:00.500 --> 26:02.200
How the fuck did they lay 25
eggs

26:02.267 --> 26:05.100
in a few days
while we've been in Rome?!

26:05.167 --> 26:07.167
Whoa, it did it itself!
Oh, my God!

26:08.100 --> 26:09.867
We've been away for that long,

26:09.933 --> 26:13.867
these ducks have laid eggs for
fun.
What are we gonna do with them?

26:15.900 --> 26:17.200
Have you spoke?

26:17.267 --> 26:20.833
Nah, didn't speak the whole way,
didn't speak once on the flight.

26:20.900 --> 26:22.933
The stand-off continues.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.433
I haven't spoke to Chloe
since last night.

26:25.500 --> 26:28.433
I was trying to do her a favour
and she fucking lost it.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.900
You'll have to move back
in the boys' room.

26:30.967 --> 26:33.300
Fuck that!
That was a bit rude! It wasn't!

26:33.367 --> 26:36.100
If you said, "Can I go
to the boys' room? I missed ya."

26:36.167 --> 26:38.900
No, he has an argument
with Chloe he's like...

26:38.967 --> 26:41.667
There's no way
I'm leaving the girls' bedroom.

26:41.733 --> 26:46.400
Chloe made it personal,
so if anyone's leaving, it's
her.

26:46.467 --> 26:49.367
I'm staying.
I'm being stubborn on this one.

26:51.267 --> 26:54.200
What's the matter, babe?
It's me and Nathan.

26:54.267 --> 26:57.367
Ah, is that what it...
Ah, bless you, man.

26:57.433 --> 27:00.867
We're out checking the ducks
and suddenly, Chloe starts
crying.

27:00.933 --> 27:02.833
I do feel really bad for her

27:02.900 --> 27:05.233
that she hasn't spoken
to Nathan since Rome.

27:05.300 --> 27:08.867
I can't be bothered.
Me and Nathan have always been
close

27:08.933 --> 27:12.700
and now it's just totally
changed.
I feel he talks to us like shit.

27:12.767 --> 27:14.533
I don't know who is any more,
like.

27:14.600 --> 27:17.800
Everything I do I feel like
he's got to complain about it.

27:17.867 --> 27:19.600
You need to talk to him about
it.

27:19.667 --> 27:22.700
If that was my best friend,
I'd straight up say,

27:22.767 --> 27:25.800
"You treat me like this,
we're supposed to be mates."

27:25.867 --> 27:29.267
I don't have him
and I don't have Marty any more.

27:31.500 --> 27:33.367
I feel like I've got no-one.

27:33.433 --> 27:36.800
You should talk to him properly.
Sober and not in the club...

27:36.867 --> 27:39.867
Chloe, you never get upset,
and it's affected you.

27:39.933 --> 27:42.733
I feel like he hates us,
but I've done nothing wrong

27:42.800 --> 27:46.367
And my friendship with him means
more to me than anything

27:46.433 --> 27:49.367
and I'm scared in case
I can't get it back.

27:49.433 --> 27:52.167
And I've got snot on my nose.

27:52.233 --> 27:53.933
I've wiped it off now though.

27:54.000 --> 27:57.433
Do you think we should go inside
and show all the eggs they laid?

27:57.500 --> 27:59.467
You're all right now, yeah?
Yeah.

28:00.833 --> 28:03.167
Eggs, anybody?

28:03.233 --> 28:04.667
All them from the ducks?

28:04.733 --> 28:08.033
Have any hatched?
This is full-on protein.

28:08.100 --> 28:11.567
You know what's in sperm
is in the same as an egg?

28:11.633 --> 28:13.100
Taurine?
A lot of protein.

28:13.167 --> 28:16.933
Eh? Sophie your lad might have
eggy sperm, but I fucking don't!

28:17.000 --> 28:20.167
Right since we came back
and it's still sunny,

28:20.233 --> 28:24.933
before we go out, I reckon
me and lads, we go get a
barbecue.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.800
Yay! Right, we'll make it.
We got all the food.

28:27.867 --> 28:29.900
The weather has followed us home

28:29.967 --> 28:32.600
and I am sick of eating pizza
and pasta.

28:32.667 --> 28:35.067
I want some fucking meat!

28:35.133 --> 28:37.267
Yous can do the drinks,
we'll do the food.

28:37.333 --> 28:39.233
Leave the cooking to us!
Bye, girls.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.567
Ah, it's raining.

28:40.633 --> 28:43.267
They do realise
the sun's actually not out?

28:43.333 --> 28:45.700
We're in Newcastle.
I went along with it.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.900
People will barbecue in the
snow.

28:47.967 --> 28:49.800
Let's get ready for the
barbecue.

28:49.867 --> 28:52.100
A good old barbecue is what we
need.

28:52.167 --> 28:56.400
We need some proper English,
Aberdeen Angus fucking steak.

28:58.367 --> 29:00.933
We're back with food and
barbecues!

29:01.000 --> 29:02.100
Ah, you fucker.

29:02.167 --> 29:04.233
Where you gonna put it?
In the corner.

29:04.300 --> 29:06.333
Not near ducks.
Don't set them on fire.

29:06.400 --> 29:09.533
I've done the shopping with the
boys,
so that's me done.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.933
What?
Yous can this!

29:11.000 --> 29:14.300
Well, don't expect any food.
It's my job to toss the salad!

29:14.367 --> 29:17.567
Go make salad.
Go and be awkward with Chloe.

29:17.633 --> 29:20.267
Babe, I love awkward situations.

29:20.333 --> 29:21.867
I hope Chloe slaps you!

29:21.933 --> 29:25.133
Nathan, you know what it is,
we can just do this ourselves!

29:25.200 --> 29:26.300
Are these legs?

29:27.900 --> 29:29.767
Where's the instructions?

29:31.200 --> 29:32.967
There's no screws!
What?!

29:33.033 --> 29:34.700
OK, maybe not!

29:34.767 --> 29:36.967
That just goes in there.

29:37.033 --> 29:39.267
There we gan.
Oh, yeah.

29:39.333 --> 29:40.367
Fucking flying!

29:40.433 --> 29:42.000
Howay, man, piece of piss.

29:42.067 --> 29:44.000
I was thinking
when I first got here,

29:44.067 --> 29:47.233
I was like, "It's the first time
we've been single for ages."

29:47.300 --> 29:50.300
Then I realised,
you were single for about an
hour.

29:50.367 --> 29:53.533
I'm not sure what is going on
between Aaron and Marnie.

29:53.600 --> 29:57.700
All I know is I want my best
friend on the pull tonight.

29:57.767 --> 29:59.767
Let's just be naughty,
live the dream.

29:59.833 --> 30:02.867
Mate, are you fucking mad? Mate.

30:02.933 --> 30:06.300
But howay, it was our only
chance
to be single together.

30:06.367 --> 30:07.500
I feel like it's gone!

30:07.567 --> 30:10.433
Sorry, Gaz, things are going
well
with me and Marns.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.600
And I want to see
where it's going to go.

30:12.667 --> 30:16.033
Just because you're single,
doesn't mean I'm going on the
pull.

30:16.100 --> 30:19.433
I don't know what to do about
Abbie. Loving being single.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.600
I haven't been happy in a long
time.

30:21.667 --> 30:25.400
Me and Abbie had some fun in
Rome,
but that is where it has stayed.

30:25.467 --> 30:27.633
She's a good girl,
but I'm back home,

30:27.700 --> 30:30.200
I'm single
and I am on the pull tonight.

30:30.267 --> 30:32.767
(laughs)

30:32.833 --> 30:34.400
Boom!
Done. Howay then.

30:37.433 --> 30:38.833
Cheese grater, please.

30:38.900 --> 30:41.400
Barbecue's built.
It's time to prep the meat.

30:41.467 --> 30:44.833
Ah!
Barbecue party, bitches!

30:44.900 --> 30:46.367
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

30:46.433 --> 30:48.567
I didn't know
you were good at cooking!

30:48.633 --> 30:52.900
It's cute how the boys have put
so much effort into this
barbecue.

30:52.967 --> 30:54.867
I can't wait to get a burger.

30:54.933 --> 30:57.033
I'm glad the boys
are doing something,

30:57.100 --> 30:59.333
cos I feel like
women do a lot for men.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.433
Not being nasty, but what do you
do?

31:01.500 --> 31:04.067
Thank you, Nathan,
I'm glad you said that!

31:04.133 --> 31:07.833
What the fuck are they
talking about? They do fuck all!

31:07.900 --> 31:11.367
Specifically, what have you done
for them two lads in this house?

31:11.433 --> 31:13.933
We always lend them our make-up!
Exactly!

31:14.000 --> 31:16.833
(laughter)
Nah, I use Nathan's!

31:16.900 --> 31:18.000
(laughter)

31:18.067 --> 31:21.167
It's great to see that the
family
are cracking on again.

31:21.233 --> 31:22.633
I need to cheer Chloe up.

31:22.700 --> 31:25.167
You know how you had to do
that Geordie Tours job

31:25.233 --> 31:27.033
in that funny outfit?

31:28.367 --> 31:31.267
I want you to go out tonight,
wear that outfit,

31:31.333 --> 31:34.233
and the only way you can take it
off
is if you neck on.

31:34.300 --> 31:36.900
Deal? How am I going to neck on
with that on?

31:36.967 --> 31:40.167
Dressing up as the Angel of the
North on a night out in the
Toon,

31:40.233 --> 31:42.100
it better be fucking worth it.

31:42.167 --> 31:45.300
You know what I'll give you
in return? 40 chicken nuggets.

31:45.367 --> 31:48.767
Right, OK, deal.
Chicken nuggets every time.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.200
It's our first night out
back on the town

31:59.267 --> 32:03.200
and we are all looking mint, and
of
course we're going to get
mortal.

32:03.267 --> 32:07.100
I've got to wear that costume.
I can't believe I agreed to
that.

32:07.167 --> 32:09.633
If you neck on with someone
you can take it off.

32:09.700 --> 32:11.067
I have got no idea

32:11.133 --> 32:13.933
how I'm gonna pull in this
Angel of the North costume.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.767
I'm definitely
gonna give it a go.

32:15.833 --> 32:19.000
You look like a brown condom
with wings. Fucking condom?

32:19.067 --> 32:22.233
Why would you say that?
Oh, you are stunning!

32:22.300 --> 32:24.433
Oh, you're going to pull
all the cock!

32:24.500 --> 32:29.067
Who is going to want to pull a
girl
who looks like this?

32:29.133 --> 32:31.533
Listen, you'd be surprised
in Newcastle.

32:31.600 --> 32:35.300
I've got to say if Chloe manages
to pull in that fucking outfit,

32:35.367 --> 32:37.267
what a legend.

32:39.733 --> 32:42.833
I've got a new beard trimmer.
Every time, wrong setting.

32:42.900 --> 32:46.233
That is baldy face, that.
You look like a different
person.

32:46.300 --> 32:49.667
Nathan looks like a fucking
baby.

32:49.733 --> 32:52.000
What are you doing now?
Contours your skin.

32:52.067 --> 32:53.833
You look young forever.

32:55.700 --> 32:56.800
Boys, don't laugh!

32:56.867 --> 32:59.533
Nathan, this is why
you're not in the boys' room.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.633
What are you putting on your
face?

33:01.700 --> 33:04.367
In Rome, I noticed on nights
out,

33:04.433 --> 33:06.433
I'm a bit of a lone ranger
at the minute.

33:06.500 --> 33:10.900
Tonight, I want like a lads'
night.
I want the boys with me on the
pull.

33:10.967 --> 33:13.233
So, tonight they can wingman me.

33:13.300 --> 33:16.933
Right, well I'll make it my
mission
tonight to stay by your side a
lot.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.833
I mean, you haven't
got to stay by my side.

33:19.900 --> 33:23.200
Oh, no, wherever you go,
I'm gonna come too!

33:23.267 --> 33:26.767
The only reason Gary is asking
me
and Aaron to help him go on the
pull

33:26.833 --> 33:29.000
is cos he's lost touch
of how to do it.

33:29.067 --> 33:31.000
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

33:31.067 --> 33:33.533
Put red on so we're all wearing
red and black.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.800
I'll see what I can do.
Red and black.

33:39.700 --> 33:41.667
Girls, come on!

33:41.733 --> 33:43.733
Come on, Chlo... (laughs)

33:45.300 --> 33:48.500
Tonight, there's no way Chloe
is going to pull in that outfit.

33:48.567 --> 33:51.233
If she does, I'd hate
to see the state of him.

33:51.300 --> 33:53.100
Are yous wing-wommanning Chloe?

33:53.167 --> 33:55.567
We're wing-manning Gaz.
Are you on the pull?

33:55.633 --> 33:58.200
You look like you're in a boy
band
from Westlife!

33:58.267 --> 34:01.800
You're in no position
to criticise my outfit.

34:01.867 --> 34:03.333
Right, are we ready then?

34:03.400 --> 34:04.567
(cheering)

34:04.633 --> 34:05.967
(screams)

34:06.033 --> 34:08.033
Tonight is going to be a belter!

34:11.833 --> 34:13.500
The mission is to get Gary a
bird.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.266
I don't know if we'll go back
to how we used to be.

34:24.933 --> 34:28.433
I'm going to go to the shag pad,
but only for a bit of necking
on.

34:29.933 --> 34:31.933
(all) Geordie Shore, wey-aye!

34:34.967 --> 34:35.167
.

34:37.699 --> 34:37.867
.

34:53.567 --> 34:55.867
We're back in Newcastle.
It feels amazing.

34:55.933 --> 34:58.600
We're in Bijou and the mission
is to get Gary a bird.

34:58.667 --> 35:01.567
Nathan, let's not mess about
and go on the lookout.

35:09.767 --> 35:13.067
I see a girl that's fit,
Nathan's like, "I got this."

35:15.500 --> 35:17.733
He talks to the total wrong
girl!

35:21.467 --> 35:23.433
Gary, if I'm doing such a shit
job,

35:23.500 --> 35:26.700
why don't you go over there
and do it yourself?

35:30.733 --> 35:33.533
This operation is more difficult
than I thought.

35:33.600 --> 35:36.767
Gary, for some reason,
has turned very fucking picky!

35:40.067 --> 35:42.733
Look, yous two,
it's really not that hard.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.767
I'll be back in a minute.

35:56.300 --> 36:01.067
I know exactly what Gary Beadle
is playing and that's fine.

36:01.133 --> 36:04.800
Two can play that game. I don't
mind
having some fun with him,

36:04.867 --> 36:06.167
and I do fancy him.

36:13.067 --> 36:16.133
If Abbie says she's only
going to give him a kiss,

36:16.200 --> 36:19.867
that's fine, as long as it's not
a kiss on the penis.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.367
The way things are going with
Marnie
I would love to give it a go.

36:39.433 --> 36:41.233
I hope that she feels the same.

36:47.633 --> 36:51.133
Obviously I want Aaron to be
happy
and I hope Marnie feels the
same,

36:51.200 --> 36:54.433
but I can't help but think
history
is going to repeat itself.

37:02.133 --> 37:05.933
By the looks of Chloe, I would
say
she's actually enjoying that
outfit.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.100
She's dancing like a fucking
maniac.

37:13.133 --> 37:16.600
I can't believe that Nathan
still isn't speaking to us.

37:16.667 --> 37:20.167
This is the longest we haven't
spoken. We need to sort this
out.

37:23.667 --> 37:27.467
Fuck this, I'm having a full-on
heat wave in this costume.

37:27.533 --> 37:29.500
This is coming off before I die!

37:49.567 --> 37:52.733
Marnie and Aaron are getting on
the best I've ever seen them.

37:52.800 --> 37:56.700
Why don't they just give it a
go?
What is holding them back?

38:06.733 --> 38:10.033
Rome was great. It was so
romantic,
but being back in Newcastle

38:10.100 --> 38:12.467
is reminding us
of mine and Aaron's past.

38:12.533 --> 38:14.867
I just want to have fun,
nothing too serious.

38:14.933 --> 38:16.533
I hope he feels the same.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.600
It seems like
Marnie's more interested

38:23.667 --> 38:27.167
in talking about her arsehole
than her and Aaron.

38:27.233 --> 38:29.433
He's going to be so
disappointed.

38:32.900 --> 38:34.667
(both laugh)

38:42.667 --> 38:44.900
I can't bear
not talking to my best friend!

38:44.967 --> 38:48.167
We haven't spoken since Rome.
We need to sort this out.

39:02.900 --> 39:06.167
Chloe is absolutely mortal
and a nightclub is no place

39:06.233 --> 39:07.800
for me and you to resolve this.

39:07.867 --> 39:11.000
We both know what happens
when you're drunk on a night
out.

39:11.067 --> 39:13.567
We end up kicking off.
I'm not doing it again.

39:21.067 --> 39:23.500
I really miss Nathan.
He's my best friend

39:23.567 --> 39:25.467
I feel like
he doesn't feel the same.

39:25.533 --> 39:27.633
A lot of things
have happened between us

39:27.700 --> 39:31.033
and I don't know if we'll
go back to how we used to be.

39:35.367 --> 39:37.233
I see a girl
who I'm trying to pull,

39:37.300 --> 39:39.633
but I turn around,
see Abbie and she's fitter

39:39.700 --> 39:43.067
than the girls I've been looking
at.
Why don't I just pull Abbie?

39:58.967 --> 40:01.633
As I predicted,
Gary is trying to crack on to me

40:01.700 --> 40:04.133
and he wants us
to stay in the same bed tonight.

40:11.300 --> 40:15.200
Gary promises nothing will
happen.
Well, I never break a promise.

40:17.400 --> 40:19.467
Come on, the pinkie promise
trick.

40:19.533 --> 40:22.167
A pinkie promise
I won't try anything on tonight.

40:22.233 --> 40:23.967
Of course you're gonna try.

40:29.900 --> 40:31.867
We've all had a cracking night.

40:31.933 --> 40:34.833
Let's get back to the house
and get some scran.

40:44.233 --> 40:45.633
Have a health kick.

40:45.700 --> 40:47.667
Shall we have a sesh in the
garden.

40:47.733 --> 40:49.833
Come on, let's have a sesh
in the garden.

40:49.900 --> 40:52.067
It does feel good to be
back in Newcastle.

40:52.133 --> 40:54.767
Back to having dirty kebabs
in this dirty house

40:54.833 --> 40:56.433
with all these dirty people.

40:56.500 --> 41:00.100
We started the day and ended it
the
same way, outside with food
again.

41:00.167 --> 41:01.333
Yep.

41:01.400 --> 41:03.067
We're fucking greedy, us.

41:03.133 --> 41:04.533
All we do is eat and drink.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.900
Tonight has been a little
bit of a weird one.

41:07.967 --> 41:10.500
I think it's wise
Nathan didn't speak to me.

41:10.567 --> 41:13.633
Everyone knows when I'm pissed
I don't know what I'm doing.

41:13.700 --> 41:16.233
I need to go to bed
and sort it out in the morning.

41:16.300 --> 41:18.900
This is better than Italian
food,
I'll say that.

41:18.967 --> 41:22.600
Italian food is better not in
Italy!

41:22.667 --> 41:24.067
(laughs) Yeah!

41:24.133 --> 41:29.000
We started in Rome, but now
we're back home, it's time for
bed.

41:29.067 --> 41:30.367
Let's go to bed.

41:30.433 --> 41:32.367
Go to bed then, Gary.

41:35.667 --> 41:36.733
Come on, Abs.

41:41.033 --> 41:43.400
If I'm sleeping
in the same bed as Gary,

41:43.467 --> 41:45.300
I'm gonna wear my best nightie.

41:45.367 --> 41:49.167
It would be rude not to
and I know I look hot in it.

41:49.233 --> 41:50.800
Oh, hello.
Hello.

41:52.200 --> 41:55.667
Me and Aaron head up to the
boys'
room and then Gaz and Abbie walk
in,

41:55.733 --> 41:58.000
as if they're going to
get this bed from us.

41:58.067 --> 42:00.300
No chance, guys. Move on.

42:05.067 --> 42:07.400
Go to the shag pad
cos it's all yours.

42:07.467 --> 42:10.400
Me and Marnie are staying
in this double bed to get it on!

42:17.667 --> 42:21.333
I'm in the shag pad,
but only for a bit of necking
on.

42:21.400 --> 42:23.233
Well, maybe.

42:24.400 --> 42:28.000
Me and Abbie start kissing
and then intensely start
kissing.

42:28.067 --> 42:30.867
I think that pinkie promise
might be getting broken.

42:33.067 --> 42:36.067
Things are getting heated.
I think it's my cue to leave.

42:36.133 --> 42:39.467
Sorry, Gary, I never break
my pinkie promises.

42:40.900 --> 42:42.900
Cheers for that!

42:42.967 --> 42:44.400
(groans)

42:50.200 --> 42:53.833
(Marnie) Oh, my God! Jesus!

42:53.900 --> 42:56.000
Oh, God.

42:56.067 --> 42:59.067
(Aaron) Squeaky's back!
Squeaky's back!

43:05.100 --> 43:08.400
She let us come. She doesn't
normally! Yeah, he finally come!

43:08.467 --> 43:10.567
His balls must be
bigger than my melons!

43:10.633 --> 43:13.700
Ah, Marnie!
(mimics gunshot)

43:15.900 --> 43:17.600
See my balls.

43:17.667 --> 43:19.833
Move over, Kim K.

43:19.900 --> 43:21.133
It's fucking not on.

43:23.067 --> 43:24.900
The horny bitch!

43:24.967 --> 43:26.800
Could Gary be falling for Abbie?

43:26.867 --> 43:28.367
(cheering)

43:29.467 --> 43:31.233
He's got the fingers of a
pianist!

43:32.200 --> 43:33.667
(cheering)

43:33.733 --> 43:36.667
Aaron! Is this what he's like
when I'm not around?

43:37.633 --> 43:39.200
What a fucking idiot.

44:06.900 --> 44:07.100
.
