* I see the crystal
raindrops fall *

00:04.338 --> 00:06.640

CHRIS ROCK:
When I was a kid,
I never had a chance

00:08.676 --> 00:10.344
to hang out with my dad much,

00:10.378 --> 00:13.614
because all it seemed like
he did was work and sleep.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.283
I tried working with him.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.650
Come on, Chris, we got
to pick up the pace.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.452
We only got five minutes
at this spot. Here we go.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.189
I tried sleeping with him.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.324
* Just the two of us

00:23.357 --> 00:25.659
* We can make it if we try

00:25.693 --> 00:26.827
* Just the two of us...

00:26.860 --> 00:28.296
But the one thing we loved

00:28.329 --> 00:30.098
doing together
was watching baseball.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.200
* Just the two of us

00:35.203 --> 00:37.338
* ...in the sky,
just the two of us *

00:37.371 --> 00:39.173
Oh, I'll get it.
* You and I

00:39.207 --> 00:41.209
Nothing could spoil
family time like

00:41.242 --> 00:42.843
a visit from my Uncle Michael.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.478
Big man!

00:44.512 --> 00:45.679
What's going on, Michael?

00:45.713 --> 00:47.748
Besides Mama being mad
at me for eating all

00:47.781 --> 00:49.750
the Captain Crunch, nothing.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.389
Who's up?

00:55.423 --> 00:57.425
Mets by one.
Mmm.

00:58.592 --> 00:59.793
Hey, big man,

00:59.827 --> 01:02.496
you want to see the Dodgers
and the Mets play on Saturday?

01:02.530 --> 01:03.197
You got Mets tickets?

01:03.231 --> 01:04.865
Where'd you get 'em?
My man.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.500
He used to work
in the box office.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.735
He got 'em from his girl.

01:07.768 --> 01:10.171
Michael, I can't
afford those tickets.

01:10.204 --> 01:11.439
I'm not selling them.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.541
We're family.
You can have them.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.676
What's the catch?
No catch.

01:15.709 --> 01:19.380
My father would accept
free tickets to a funeral.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.183
Box seats, huh?

01:22.216 --> 01:24.518
Big man, can I borrow $40?

01:24.552 --> 01:26.887
Michael, if you needed $40

01:26.920 --> 01:29.390
why didn't you just sell me
the tickets for $40?

01:29.423 --> 01:30.591
That's against the law.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.526
My uncle was a lazy bum,

01:32.560 --> 01:34.495
but he was honest.
What you need $40 for?

01:34.528 --> 01:35.863
I need it for a date.

01:35.896 --> 01:38.599
I want to pay so I can make
a good first impression.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.501
Especially if your second
impression is

01:40.534 --> 01:42.203
"can I borrow $20?"

01:42.236 --> 01:43.437
So who you going out with?

01:43.471 --> 01:44.738
Mm-mmm, I ain't saying.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.274
I've been in a slump lately

01:46.307 --> 01:47.508
and I don't want to jinx

01:47.541 --> 01:49.177
this one.
Why don't you
get a job?

01:49.210 --> 01:50.811
And move out
of your mother's house.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.680
So can we go, Dad?

01:52.713 --> 01:54.415
Yeah, Gooden's pitching.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.350
All right.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.552
Cool, y'all 'bout
to see a good game.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.688
Y'all 'bout to see
Gooden and Strawberry.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.724
A few years later, you'd have
to go to prison to do that.

CHRIS ROCK:
While I was planning
on the game,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.329
Vanessa was about
to get played.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.796
Girl, guess who
asked me out?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.632
Who?
Michael.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.534
Mailman Michael?
No.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.569
Garbage man Michael?
No.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.471
Her man Michael?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.373
She went out
with him last week.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.641
Your brother Michael.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.476
What? Vanessa,

02:55.509 --> 02:57.645
stop playing.
Girl, I'm serious.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.647
He wants to take me
to dinner and everything.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.816
Everything means nothing
but dinner.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.252
Well, what would make him think

03:04.285 --> 03:05.519
that you would want
go out with him?

03:05.553 --> 03:07.255
Because I said "yes."

03:07.288 --> 03:09.290
And you know I never
turn down a free meal.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.824
And I think he's kinda sweet.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.626
Just like diabetes.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.727
And besides, you never know

03:13.761 --> 03:15.829
where you might find love.
In the arms of a bum.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.698
Mm!

03:17.731 --> 03:19.433
What do you mean, "Mm!"?

03:19.467 --> 03:20.901
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.570
That's all.
Mm-mm.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.872
It's just dinner. You act like
the man is moving in.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.307
Keep an eye on your keys.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.575
I'm just saying,

03:27.608 --> 03:29.277
every time you go on a bad date,

03:29.310 --> 03:30.878
I end up with a bad perm.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.647
Don't worry, your hair's going
to be just fine.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.518
After six months on the block,

03:37.551 --> 03:39.387
Tasha had me confused.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.555
She was a cute girl
who didn't hate me.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.359
So I'll see you guys
at the theater.
Bye, Tasha.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.894
Bye.
Hey, Tasha.

03:46.927 --> 03:47.928
Hi, Chris.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.497
So, what's going on?

03:49.530 --> 03:50.731
We're going to the movies
Saturday.

03:50.764 --> 03:51.932
You want to come?

03:51.965 --> 03:54.268
What are you gonna go see?
What are you,

03:54.302 --> 03:56.404
Siskel and Stupid?
Just say you want to go.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.038
Back to the Future.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.508
Well, let me just
get one thing clear.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.577
You want me to go with you
to the movies on Saturday?

04:03.611 --> 04:05.313
Yeah. It'll be cool.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.880
Yeah, it'll be real cool.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.583
Like, cool is the
word, too, so...

04:09.617 --> 04:11.652
Man, shut up before I build
a time machine

04:11.685 --> 04:13.821
and come back to smack you
upside the head.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.689
So, I'll see you Saturday?

04:15.723 --> 04:17.391
Yep, you'll see me Saturday.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.626
Okay.
If I don't have

04:18.659 --> 04:20.694
a heart attack by Friday.

04:20.728 --> 04:24.064
Tonya loved Billy Ocean,
so naturally, she

04:24.097 --> 04:25.566
joined the Billy Ocean fan club

04:25.599 --> 04:27.568
and sent off
for an autographed picture.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.802
But it wasn't the first

04:28.836 --> 04:30.438
fan club she joined.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.905
There was the DeBarge fan club.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.710
The Shalamar fan club.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.682
Even the Terence Trent D'Arby
fan club.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.918
Too bad they were bought out
by the Al B. Sure fan club

04:44.952 --> 04:46.454
TONYA:
Is that it?

04:46.487 --> 04:47.921
No.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.757
Is that it?
No.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.626
Is that it?
No. I got the light bill,

04:52.660 --> 04:54.495
the gas bill,
and the telephone bill.

04:54.528 --> 04:55.829
There's nothing here
from Billy Ocean.

04:55.863 --> 04:58.699
Not unless his picture's
on one of these bills.
But you mailed it

04:58.732 --> 05:00.033
almost a month ago.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.770
A month ago?
Baby, it's been barely

05:02.803 --> 05:03.737
four weeks.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.973
Relax, you'll get your picture.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.845
Hey, Mom, can I have
a piece of gum?
Sure.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.086
Uh-oh.
No gum?

05:19.119 --> 05:21.655
Yeah, I got it-- here.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.860
That look means "Damn!"

05:26.894 --> 05:28.462
Damn!
See?

05:28.496 --> 05:30.531
My mother had lost more stuff

05:30.564 --> 05:32.666
in her purse than
the Bermuda Triangle.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.968
She lost little things.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.671
There's my lipstick.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.674
She lost big things.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.710
There's that skillet.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.145
She lost great big things.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.381
There's that gallon of milk.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.019
And things she didn't know
how she lost.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.155
There's my purse.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.890
They might have found
Biggie's killer

05:56.924 --> 05:58.826
if they looked inside
my mother's purse.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.764
What's that?

06:03.797 --> 06:05.165
Tonya's waiting on a picture

06:05.198 --> 06:06.767
from the Billy
Ocean Fan Club,

06:06.800 --> 06:08.502
but I forgot to
mail the letter.

06:08.536 --> 06:10.170
Now I don't know
what to tell her.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.973
How about "I forgot to mail
your letter to Billy Ocean"?

06:13.006 --> 06:14.475
Are you crazy?

06:14.508 --> 06:16.444
I can't just
tell her I forgot.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.178
What are you going to do?

06:18.211 --> 06:20.581
I'm going to get her
a picture of Billy Ocean.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.819
Monk was always on guard.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.187
Is that your brother?

06:27.220 --> 06:29.790
Yeah.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.692
Just checking.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.561
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.463
Okay.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.064
Hey, man, was that Tasha?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.732
Yeah, she just invited me

06:38.766 --> 06:39.967
to go see
Back to the Future.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.835
Oh, for real? That's cool.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.671
Yeah, I didn't know
she liked me that much.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.806
No, I was talking about
Back to the Future.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.541
Oh.
So it's just you and her?

06:47.575 --> 06:48.876
No, some other people are going.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.010
Oh, cool.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.812
So you gonna sit next to her?

06:51.845 --> 06:54.548
I hope so.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.650
So when you going?
Uh, Saturday.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.185
What Saturday?

06:58.218 --> 06:59.553
This Saturday.

06:59.587 --> 07:00.788
How are you going to see

07:00.821 --> 07:01.889
Back To The Future with Tasha

07:01.922 --> 07:03.924
and we're supposed to be
going to the game with Dad?

07:04.925 --> 07:06.760
Shoot, I forgot about that.

07:06.794 --> 07:07.761
I thought about one girl

07:07.795 --> 07:10.564
so much when I was 16,
I forgot I was 30.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.767
Well, maybe Dad won't mind
if I don't go to the game.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.969
I think he's probably
gonna be crushed.

07:16.003 --> 07:18.138
I mean, plus he got
those tickets for free.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.741
It's a Saturday
and he got a day off work.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.743
I mean, who knows when
that's gonna happen again.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.078
This was gonna be one
of the best days of his life.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.914
Now it's ruined.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.249
I'm glad some girl didn't
ask me to go to the movies.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.085
I'm glad I'm not you.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.954
Oh, well. See you later.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.959
Where's a flux capacitor
when you need one?

07:43.030 --> 07:44.532
Tuna on the top,

07:44.565 --> 07:46.266
sardines, then the cat food.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.503
CHRIS ROCK:
For working people,
broke people and old people.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.805
So your daddy's got box seats
to the Mets game, huh?

07:51.839 --> 07:52.940
And you're not going?

07:52.973 --> 07:54.675
I haven't decided yet.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.109
Well, what's to decide?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.578
Is she cute?

07:57.611 --> 07:58.879
It's Tasha.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.081
Tasha!

08:01.114 --> 08:03.917
That was the code name to my
first field exercise in Qatar.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.953
Man, forget that game.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.221
They play 180 games
a year, every year.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.957
That girl asked you out once.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.125
Now don't expect her
to do it twice.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.961
Anyway... I couldn't imagine

08:13.994 --> 08:15.295
going to a baseball game
with my father.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.864
Why not?
Because they didn't

08:16.897 --> 08:18.799
have baseball games
in the Quang Ngai Province.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.834
Was your dad in Vietnam?
Nope.

08:20.868 --> 08:21.802
Queens.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.571
I don't know, he disappeared
when I was two.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.705
I haven't seen him since.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.908
20 years later, Monk found
his father on MySpace.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.844
Profile name:
Military Mike-tastic.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.080
Look, you ain't gotta take
my word for it.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.082
I'm not.
But ask anybody,
they'll tell you.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.217
You can always hang out
with your daddy.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.719
Go to the movie.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.220
Go to the game, man.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.855
You know if my father
wasn't in jail,

08:41.889 --> 08:43.190
that's what I'd do.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.759
Yeah, go to the game,
but whatever you do,

08:45.793 --> 08:47.260
don't sit behind home plate.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.097
My father was killed
by a line drive

08:50.130 --> 08:53.166
to the the medulla
oblongata.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.234
Tragic.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.836
Go to the game.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.305
My father never took me
'cause I was a test tube baby.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.007
Want some peanuts?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.909
Why don't you and the girl
go see a movie

09:01.942 --> 09:04.211
about the game that
your father's going to.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.279
Hurrah...

09:06.313 --> 09:08.949
sowah...

09:08.982 --> 09:09.950
I don't know, man.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.585
That's a tough one.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.921
Game-girl,
girl-game. Well...

09:13.954 --> 09:15.322
if you pick the girl,

09:15.355 --> 09:16.824
there's a good chance
you're gonna hurt

09:16.857 --> 09:18.158
your dad's feelings, but..

09:18.191 --> 09:21.662
it is his job to love you
unconditionally.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.896
Now, if you pick the game,

09:22.930 --> 09:25.032
you might hurt
Tasha's feelings...

09:25.065 --> 09:26.734
not to mention

09:26.767 --> 09:28.035
you'll miss
Back To The Future,

09:28.068 --> 09:29.703
which is supposed
to be one of the best

09:29.737 --> 09:31.805
movies out
this year, but...

09:31.839 --> 09:33.206
it will be a pretty
good game,

09:33.240 --> 09:35.308
so I'd have to say girl.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.010
No, game.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.045
Girl.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.347
Wait, no-- game!

09:40.380 --> 09:42.916
Girl!

09:42.950 --> 09:44.785
Game!

09:51.058 --> 09:52.159
Get your butt over here.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.394
Rochelle?!
What are you doing out here

09:54.427 --> 09:55.863
sneaking up on people?

09:55.896 --> 09:57.330
You could've caused me
to have a heart attack.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.066
Michael should've
died years ago,

09:59.099 --> 10:01.068
but his heart was way too lazy

10:01.101 --> 10:02.903
to attack him.
What do you think you're doing?

10:02.936 --> 10:03.904
What?

10:03.937 --> 10:06.874
Why did you ask Vanessa
to go out with you?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.208
Because she cute,

10:08.241 --> 10:10.177
she got a good job,
she need a man,

10:10.210 --> 10:11.912
Mama said I need a woman,

10:11.945 --> 10:14.247
plus, I hear she
co-signs on loans.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.784
Well, you need to ask
somebody else out.

10:16.817 --> 10:19.019
You don't see me
going around asking
your friends out.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.954
What're you saying,
I'm not good enough

10:20.988 --> 10:22.956
for your friend?
No, Michael, I'm saying

10:22.990 --> 10:24.892
that if you go out with
her and have a good time,

10:24.925 --> 10:26.393
she's going to expect
you to call her back.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.161
You ain't got no money,

10:28.195 --> 10:29.763
you ain't got no phone,

10:29.797 --> 10:31.231
and if she hasn't
heard from you,

10:31.264 --> 10:33.867
she's gonna be distracted.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.202
And if I end up with
a bald patch in my head

10:35.235 --> 10:36.837
'cause she left the
perm in too long--

10:36.870 --> 10:38.138
oh, you and me...

10:39.172 --> 10:40.273
...we gonna have problems!

10:40.307 --> 10:41.374
Well, I'm sorry, sis.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.943
She already said yes.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.412
I can't cancel right now.
What would I look like?

10:45.445 --> 10:46.379
Like a bald patch.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.716
Don't you walk away
from me! Don't you walk...

10:48.749 --> 10:49.950
I'm gonna get my woman.
Michael!

10:49.983 --> 10:51.351
Back at home,

10:51.384 --> 10:54.187
I was about to call
the game on a technicality.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.289
Mm! The Dodgers are
on a three-game run.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.791
They're going
to stomp the Mets.

10:57.825 --> 10:58.692
This game is
gonna be good.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.728
I thought we wanted
the Dodgers to lose.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.696
Usually.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.698
But the Dodgers
are the only team

11:04.732 --> 11:06.366
that weren't mean
to Jackie Robinson.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.902
You hire the only black guy
playing, I'm on your side.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.771
I feel the same way
about midgets.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.306
Baby, I haven't seen
you this excited

11:13.340 --> 11:15.175
since you found that
book of food stamps.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.243
She should have seen him

11:16.276 --> 11:18.378
when he found a meter
with time left on it!

11:18.411 --> 11:20.480
Look, we got great seats,
free tickets,

11:20.513 --> 11:22.482
I got the day off, and I get
to hang with my boys.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.017
If you threw in a nap,

11:24.051 --> 11:25.085
he would die and go to heaven.

11:25.118 --> 11:28.221
If you threw in a nap,
I'd die and go to heaven.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.222
See?

11:29.256 --> 11:31.358
Tonya, you want some cornbread?

11:31.391 --> 11:34.394
No, I'm not really
all that hungry.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.296
Baby, you got to eat.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.998
You don't want
to die of starvation

11:38.031 --> 11:39.032
before your picture gets here.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.368
Oh, okay.

11:41.401 --> 11:44.104
DREW:
Hey, Dad?

11:44.137 --> 11:45.939
Can we eat whatever
we want at the game?

11:45.973 --> 11:47.140
Yeah.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.743
As long as it costs
less than $2.00.

11:49.777 --> 11:52.212
I'm going to get two hot dogs,
cotton candy, and peanuts...

11:52.245 --> 11:53.413
Chris, what you gonna eat?

11:53.446 --> 11:55.849
My words?

11:55.883 --> 11:56.950
Nothing.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.451
Because I'm not
going to the game.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.221
What do you mean?

12:01.254 --> 12:04.457
Well, Tasha asked me if I wanted
to go to the movies on Saturday,

12:04.491 --> 12:05.492
and I said "yes."

12:05.525 --> 12:08.862
My father never
really showed his feelings,

12:08.896 --> 12:12.532
but when he was hurt,
he'd always say the same thing.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.067
Cool.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.536
Cool.

12:16.569 --> 12:20.007
That's not cool, that's cold.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.644
CHRIS ROCK:
After giving it some thought,

12:24.677 --> 12:27.047
Vanessa decided to give my mom
a piece of her mind.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.081
Rochelle.

12:28.115 --> 12:32.052
Ah, hey, Vanessa,
what's up?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.021
Well, you tell me-- why don't
you think I'm good enough

12:34.054 --> 12:35.022
to go out with your brother?

12:35.055 --> 12:36.456
I never said that.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.258
I tell you what,
Miss High and Mighty,

12:38.291 --> 12:39.526
when you figure out
what you are trying to say,

12:39.559 --> 12:40.527
you call me at home

12:40.560 --> 12:42.195
and then say it.

12:42.229 --> 12:45.498
Until then, find somebody else
to wax your mustache.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.368
What about the soul patch?

12:52.172 --> 12:53.807
My mother went from
making a snap judgment

12:53.841 --> 12:55.542
to looking for a snapshot.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.045
Oh, Risky, Risky, Risky.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.579
Oh, hey, Rochelle, what do you
need

12:59.612 --> 13:02.582
Do you still have those
celebrity autograph pictures?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.317
I might have a few.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.585
You got Billy Ocean?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.921
What you want with a
picture of Billy Ocean?

13:07.955 --> 13:08.922
It's for Tonya.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.859
All right, Tonya.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.561
All right, let's see here.

13:14.594 --> 13:20.167
Okay, uh, Billie Jean King,
Wild Bill Hickok, uh...

13:20.200 --> 13:21.068
Billy Joel...

13:21.101 --> 13:22.836
What do you do with
these pictures anyway?

13:22.870 --> 13:24.304
Oh, I sell 'em to
soul food restaurants.

13:26.006 --> 13:30.844
Okay, Arctic Ocean,
uh, Atlantic Ocean,

13:30.878 --> 13:32.545
Pacific Ocean...
Billy Ocean!

13:32.579 --> 13:34.014
Ah! Yes!
Billy Ocean!

13:34.047 --> 13:35.048
Yes! Thank you.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.284
Two dollars.
Okay, here you go.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.285
All right.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.286
You got a bagel?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.353
Oh, sure, sure.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.223
Oat, uh, honey...
Thanks.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.558
Out of all the people
I talked to

13:45.592 --> 13:47.294
the only one who
didn't tell me what to do

13:47.327 --> 13:51.498
was the one who
it mattered to most.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.499
Hey, Dad.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.267
Yeah?

13:54.301 --> 13:55.335
I'm going to work.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.636
I'll be back
in a little bit.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.871
Okay.

14:01.008 --> 14:01.975
Dad?

14:02.009 --> 14:03.243
Yeah?

14:03.276 --> 14:05.512
Can I go to the Mets game
with you and Drew?

14:05.545 --> 14:07.881
What happened to your movie?

14:07.915 --> 14:10.083
Nothing.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.085
(baseball game playing
on TV)

14:12.119 --> 14:13.220
I'd just rather
go to the game.

14:13.253 --> 14:18.125
Okay... Cool.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.493
Cool.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.263
For the first time, "cool"
actually meant "cool."

14:23.296 --> 14:25.132
ANNOUNCER:
It's Mets against the Dodgers

14:25.165 --> 14:27.267
this Saturday, from Shea,
on Mets Network...

14:27.300 --> 14:29.069
Ain't you supposed
to be going to work?

14:29.102 --> 14:30.971
Yeah.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.548
Letting my father down
was hard,

14:41.581 --> 14:45.185
but bailing out on Tasha
was going to be worse.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.353
Hey, Chris.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.655
Hey, Tasha.

14:48.688 --> 14:49.923
Um, I've got
some bad news.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.258
What?

14:51.291 --> 14:53.093
I can't go to the movies
with you on Saturday.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.494
Why not?

14:54.527 --> 14:56.296
I've got to go to this
baseball game with my dad.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.330
That's okay.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.433
Hey, Eric.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.002
Want to go to the movies
Saturday?

15:02.035 --> 15:03.336
Sure.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.105
See you Saturday.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.406
Okay.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.108
If Tasha were here
to do her voice-over,

15:08.141 --> 15:09.409
she would admit that
she's heartbroken.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.178
ADULT TASHA:
No, I wouldn't.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.347
I wasn't heartbroken, I don't
even remember this happening.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.349
So I'll see you later?

15:16.383 --> 15:18.685
Um, yeah.
Okay.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.653
CHRIS ROCK:
While Tasha silently
suffered in Brooklyn...

15:20.687 --> 15:22.222
TASHA:
I wasn't suffering then

15:22.255 --> 15:23.623
and I'm not suffering now--
I don't care.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.159
CHRIS ROCK:
Be quiet.The next day,
outside of Shea Stadium...

15:26.193 --> 15:27.127
Man, I can't wait.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.728
Hey, Dad, during the
seventh-inning stretch,

15:28.761 --> 15:29.829
can we get some
caramel corn?

15:29.862 --> 15:33.967
Yeah, but let's not eat so much
we get sick-- Come on.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.203
I would've enjoyed
Back to the Future with Tasha,

15:36.236 --> 15:39.539
but it wasn't better than a day
in the present with my father.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.541
Here you go.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.978
Hold on--
you can't use these.

15:45.012 --> 15:45.478
Why not?

15:45.512 --> 15:46.646
Why not?

15:46.679 --> 15:47.647
What do you think,
I can't read?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.082
What are you talking about?

15:49.116 --> 15:51.985
These are from
last year's game.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.054
Let me see those.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.722
April, 1984?

15:55.755 --> 15:57.490
Otherwise known as last year.

15:57.524 --> 16:02.162
I'm going to kill your uncle.

16:02.195 --> 16:03.730
Do you mind?

16:03.763 --> 16:05.532
Uh, where's the ticket booth?

16:05.565 --> 16:07.734
Maybe we can buy some
bleacher seats.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.003
I don't think so.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.071
The game's sold out.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.505
Did I ask you that?

16:12.539 --> 16:14.174
Fine, go to
the ticket booth.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.076
They're going to
tell you the same thing.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.512
Down and to the left.

16:19.546 --> 16:23.550
Let me know how that
works out for you.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.657
CHRIS:
So, did they have anything?

16:30.690 --> 16:32.359
Nope.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.426
Bleachers?

16:33.460 --> 16:34.494
Sold out.

16:34.527 --> 16:35.495
Nosebleeds?

16:35.528 --> 16:37.330
All full.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.331
I'm sorry, Chris.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.433
It's okay, Dad.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.669
Too bad you didn't get
to see Back to the Future.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.371
You probably could have
sat right next to Tasha.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.805
I know.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.040
And afterwards,

16:47.074 --> 16:48.108
you could have
gone to the park,

16:48.141 --> 16:49.142
got some ice cream...

16:49.176 --> 16:50.643
Yeah.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.046
Probably chocolate, 'cause
I know you like chocolate.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.747
Yeah, I know.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.049
It would've been one of
the best days of your life,

16:56.083 --> 16:57.784
and now it's ruined.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.120
I'm sure glad I didn't miss
the movie to see this game.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.321
Okay!
Okay!

17:02.622 --> 17:03.590
JULIUS:
You know what?

17:03.623 --> 17:06.726
I told you guys we were
going to see this game

17:06.759 --> 17:08.095
and we're going
to see this game.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.662
Come on.

17:18.171 --> 17:22.242
Tonya! I have a big
envelope for you!

17:22.275 --> 17:24.177
Is it my picture?

17:24.211 --> 17:27.580
Oh, I don't know, but...
smells Caribbean to me!

17:27.614 --> 17:29.649
Maybe he wrote
your name.

17:29.682 --> 17:34.421
He probably said
something special!

17:34.454 --> 17:36.823
Ma, this is not Billy Ocean.

17:36.856 --> 17:40.093
This is Billy Dee Williams.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.461
What?

17:41.494 --> 17:43.730
Let's see that.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.832
Damn it, Risky.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.406
Baby, I'm sorry.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.175
Why

17:55.208 --> 17:57.810
Well, you gave me your
letter for Billy Ocean,

17:57.844 --> 18:01.748
and I lost it in my purse,
and I never mailed it.

18:01.781 --> 18:04.251
So I'm not getting
my Billy Ocean picture.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.619
No, I'm sorry, baby.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.488
Do you still have the letter?

18:08.521 --> 18:09.756
Yeah, why?

18:09.789 --> 18:11.124
Can I have it?

18:11.158 --> 18:13.826
Oh... here.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.762
Thanks.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.397
W-wait, wait, wait
where you going?

18:17.430 --> 18:18.765
I'm going to go mail this letter

18:18.798 --> 18:21.268
so I can get my picture
of Billy Ocean.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.304
My mother always did the
best for us that she could,

18:24.337 --> 18:25.338
even if it didn't
make a bit of sense.

18:28.275 --> 18:33.413
Me and Drew had never been
inside Earl's bar.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.482
It was a place where men
got together to act like men.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.285
Hitter's got a full count.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.852
That don't mean nothing.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.421
I'll tell you what it means.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.422
It's going to be tragic.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.157
Tragic?

18:44.191 --> 18:45.592
Want to hear about
something tragic?

18:45.625 --> 18:46.826
You ever been lost in the
Peruvian Jungle

18:46.859 --> 18:47.794
with a mine
stuck to your butt?

18:47.827 --> 18:50.463
Man, will you be quiet
and watch the game?

18:50.497 --> 18:51.864
When I was a kid,

18:51.898 --> 18:53.200
I never got to hang out
with my dad that much.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.202
But not going to
a baseball game

18:55.235 --> 18:57.204
turned out to be one
of the best days ever.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.338
You okay?

18:58.371 --> 18:59.339
Yeah.
Yeah.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.540
You need anything?

19:00.573 --> 19:01.608
Can I have a beer?

19:01.641 --> 19:02.409
No.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.177
Can I have a beer?

19:04.211 --> 19:05.445
No.

19:11.251 --> 19:14.387
My mother lost friends
over money, and over men,

19:14.421 --> 19:16.356
but she wasn't about
to let anybody

19:16.389 --> 19:17.957
get in the way of a good perm.

19:17.990 --> 19:18.958
Hey, girl.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.460
Hey.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.262
I'm sorry.

19:22.295 --> 19:25.932
I shouldn't tell you who
you can and can't go out with.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.767
I know you was just
looking out for me.

19:27.800 --> 19:29.236
So how was it?

19:29.269 --> 19:30.237
Awful.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.971
I never been with a man
that cheap in my life.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.274
He's not cheap, he's broke.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.742
Trust me, there's
a big difference.

19:35.775 --> 19:36.743
Well, then why
did you let me

19:36.776 --> 19:37.744
go out with him?

19:37.777 --> 19:38.911
I tried to talk you out of it!

19:38.945 --> 19:39.979
No, you didn't.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.482
You said, "I don't think
this is such a good idea."

19:42.515 --> 19:43.950
Well, what was
I supposed to say?

19:43.983 --> 19:45.585
You supposed to say,
"He broke, don't
go out with him."

19:45.618 --> 19:46.819
And that would
make a difference?

19:46.853 --> 19:47.820
Not to Britney Spears.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.223
Yeah, well, when I'm doing
something stupid,

19:50.257 --> 19:51.224
you're supposed to stop me.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.959
Don't blame me, heifer,
you're a grown woman.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.762
Believe it or not,
that's how they made up.

19:55.795 --> 19:56.929
You still got me on the books
for Tuesday?

19:56.963 --> 19:59.732
Does Diana Ross wear a wig?

20:01.934 --> 20:03.936
Oh, that game was great.

20:03.970 --> 20:04.937
Yeah, thanks, Dad.

20:04.971 --> 20:05.972
Yeah.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.009
Whoa, cool.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.845
Yeah, if you want a car that
looks like a belt buckle.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.914
Kill Moves, where'd
you get this car?

20:14.947 --> 20:16.015
I went to see
Back to the Future

20:16.048 --> 20:17.884
and they were giving them away.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.352
That explains the car.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.254
What about the white lady?

20:21.288 --> 20:22.955
