I call 'em arm-rings.

You mean bracelets?

00:50.842 --> 00:54.137
Nope.
So different than bracelets.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.974
Okay. We gotta go now
so we can find the best spot
to watch the parade.

00:58.057 --> 01:01.311
Or you could be
riding on a float.

-No way!

01:02.979 --> 01:04.814
Hold up.
What are you holding up?

01:04.898 --> 01:09.402
The Kazoo Krewe is giving away
four golden tickets

01:09.486 --> 01:12.989
to ride as parade royalty
on their biggest float.

01:13.072 --> 01:14.908
They're the most
amazing crew in town!

01:14.991 --> 01:17.535
They're floats toss out
the shiniest beads.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.579
And have
the fiercest decorations.

01:19.662 --> 01:23.166

is the most musical.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.250

01:24.334 --> 01:27.003
But to win the golden tickets,

01:27.086 --> 01:30.006
you gotta go
on a scavenger hunt.

01:30.089 --> 01:31.966
Yes.
What's a scavenger hunt?

01:32.050 --> 01:35.303
You've got to run around
and collect a bunch of things
to win a prize.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.305
It's not going to be easy.

01:37.388 --> 01:40.350
The Kazoo Krewe
is all about mischief.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.644
Yes! What's mischief?

01:42.727 --> 01:45.522
Pranks, tricks
and surprises.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.440

-Exactly like that.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.779
Gramsy, do you think
the Maiden of Mischief
will show up?

01:52.862 --> 01:57.992
Rumor has it she's been spotted
stirring up trouble already.

01:58.076 --> 02:01.037
The Maiden comes on Mardi Gras
and plays the best tricks.

02:01.120 --> 02:04.123
She'll be the only one
standing between us
and those golden tickets.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.917
All right, you scavengers,

02:06.000 --> 02:08.419
I'll meet you
at the start of the parade.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.046
Good luck.

02:10.129 --> 02:13.174
And remember,
watch out for
The Maiden of Mischief.

02:15.134 --> 02:16.845
What are we scavengering for?

02:16.928 --> 02:18.012
Three things.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.056
A purple and green
Mardi Gras mask,

02:20.139 --> 02:22.892
a golden kazoo and the treasure
from a king cake.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.563
That's all we need
to win those tickets
and ride on that float.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.565
[Freckle] There are
so many shops.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.693
But I'll bet that one has
the mask we're looking for.

02:41.286 --> 02:45.748
Um, any chance
there's a green and purple mask
in here somewhere?

02:45.832 --> 02:48.376
-With radiant ribbons--
-Fluffy feathers--

02:48.459 --> 02:49.919
And shiny sequins.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.214
That's very specific,
but you're in luck.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.800
I have one left like that.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.802
I just don't know where it is.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.178

Help me look,
and we'll find it in no time.

-There are so many. Hey, hey!
-Nice choice, Freckle.

03:05.852 --> 03:09.856
Did you know that purple
is one of the three traditional
colors of Mardi Gras?

03:09.939 --> 03:11.983
Purple is for justice.

03:12.066 --> 03:16.029
-Green is for faith.
-And for fashion, obvi.

03:16.112 --> 03:19.240
-What's the third color?
-Gold. Gold is for power.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.285
I feel so powerful.

03:22.368 --> 03:25.496
Look! The green and purple
with ribbons, feathers
and sequins mask!

03:25.580 --> 03:27.332
I knew it was here somewhere.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.959
Why are masks
such an important part
of Mardi Gras, anyway?

03:30.043 --> 03:33.630
Wearing a mask lets you be
whoever you want to be.

03:33.713 --> 03:37.050
-Like a superhero
-Or a supervillain.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.177

-It has to be
in here somewhere.

Don't worry. I got this.

04:21.052 --> 04:24.889

do you always carry around
glue and swatches of fabric?

05:02.552 --> 05:04.846
from a famous
New Orleans street musician.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.931
It's so we can win
four golden tickets

05:07.015 --> 05:09.892
and ride on the Kazoo Krewe's
biggest parade float.

05:09.976 --> 05:14.355
I might just happen to be
in possession
of a golden kazoo.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.065
But if this is for the tickets,

05:16.149 --> 05:19.110
you gotta learn how to play
the Kazoo Krewe's Parade Song.

05:19.193 --> 05:21.195
Music is such a big part
of Mardi Gras

05:21.279 --> 05:23.906
and always adds a little magic.

The treasure from a king cake!

06:24.550 --> 06:27.845
And everyone knows
the treasure inside a king cake
is a porcelain baby doll.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.263
I didn't know that.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.015

07:06.926 --> 07:09.178
Can this tradition
get any cuter?

07:09.262 --> 07:13.474
A baby doll gets baked
into every king cake.
Then you slice up the cake--

07:13.558 --> 07:18.020
And whoever finds
the baby doll in their slice
gets crowned king for the day.
