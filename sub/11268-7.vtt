 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:04.604 --> 00:07.506
Hey, Miss Howe, I was over      
at the magic shop today,        

00:07.574 --> 00:09.608
and look what I got             
for Halloween. Aah!             

00:13.113 --> 00:14.680
It's the old                    
bloody thumb!                   

00:14.781 --> 00:15.948
                    Yuck!       

00:16.082 --> 00:17.316
  You just hide it somewhere,   

00:17.384 --> 00:19.284
and then get ready for the fun. 

00:20.720 --> 00:23.856
This was a Halloween night      
tradition around our house.     

00:23.957 --> 00:26.859
        Woody, please don't tell
        me how that got started.

00:26.926 --> 00:29.395
I thought we could use it       
tonight to scare the guys       

00:29.462 --> 00:30.562
from Gary's                     
Old Towne Tavern.               

00:30.630 --> 00:33.165
                 Woody, it's not
              scary, just gross.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.534
         That's 'cause          
 you haven't seen it in action. 

00:36.970 --> 00:38.971
I'll try it out                 
on Mr. Peterson.                

00:39.105 --> 00:41.073
                     Wood, can I
                  have a refill?

00:41.174 --> 00:42.541
Sure thing,                     
Mr. P.                          

00:42.609 --> 00:44.410
        Way ahead               
            of you.             
                      All right.

00:44.511 --> 00:46.412
             Yuck.              

00:50.717 --> 00:52.584
     What the hell is that?     

00:52.652 --> 00:55.320
     The old bloody thumb.      

00:55.388 --> 00:56.922
Didn't it scare you?            

00:56.990 --> 01:00.392
No, actually, Wood, it's really 
 more gross than anything else. 

01:00.460 --> 01:01.694
                    Told you.   

01:01.761 --> 01:02.895
Here's another beer, Norm.      

01:02.962 --> 01:05.164
                      Thank you,
                        Rebecca.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.366

All clear in the back, Sammy.   
SAM:                            
Yup.                            

02:24.210 --> 02:25.944
    Same in the office          
    and the basement.           

02:26.012 --> 02:28.480
All right, everybody, let's try 
    and stay ready for 'em.     

02:28.548 --> 02:29.782
                Ten-four, Sammy.

02:29.849 --> 02:30.949
     Listen to you people.      

02:31.017 --> 02:32.951
        Every Halloween,        
you go on this ridiculous alert,

02:33.019 --> 02:35.187
        waiting for Gary        
 and the deadbeats from his bar 

02:35.255 --> 02:36.922
to come over here and scare you.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.724
I mean,                         
you're tense all day,           

02:38.792 --> 02:39.925
        you're checking         
    under the tables,           

02:39.993 --> 02:41.493
    you're even afraid          
     to go to the bathroom.     

02:41.561 --> 02:43.062
      Well, we go upstairs      
         to Melville's.         

02:44.164 --> 02:47.166
          Hey, it's once a year.

02:47.233 --> 02:49.501
 Well, I think you guys should  
just call it off; I mean,       

02:49.569 --> 02:50.803
                    I think it's
                really childish.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.137
Excuse me? Childish?            

02:52.238 --> 02:53.739
Sweetheart, this is             

02:53.807 --> 02:55.441
bar versus bar.                 

02:55.508 --> 02:58.210
We will use any weapon          
available to us.                

02:58.278 --> 03:01.013
        Water balloons, stink   
         bombs, whoopee cushions

03:01.081 --> 03:02.514
and fake vomit.                 

03:02.582 --> 03:04.516
                Yes, fake vomit.

03:05.885 --> 03:09.588
Now, how childish is it?        

03:09.656 --> 03:11.690
          Remember last year, we
          sent Cliffy over there

03:11.758 --> 03:13.525
             wearing nothing but
              a pair of Speedos?

03:13.593 --> 03:14.727
         (all laughing,         
          snickering)           

03:16.262 --> 03:18.330
Those people were               
screaming like banshees.        

03:18.398 --> 03:19.999
(laughs)                        
             Yeah.              

03:20.066 --> 03:22.368
    Well, I was making          
         a scary face.          

03:25.872 --> 03:26.872
      Hey, Sam, I'm back.       

03:26.940 --> 03:27.973
                          CARLA:
                    Oh, look,   

03:28.041 --> 03:29.641
a bumpkin with a pumpkin.       

03:29.709 --> 03:32.478
Yeah, it's from                 
my building's roof garden.      

03:32.545 --> 03:34.880
     I entered this contest     
the local merchants are throwing

03:34.948 --> 03:36.548
 for the best jack-o'-lantern.  

03:36.616 --> 03:38.050
                  First prize is

03:38.118 --> 03:40.953
        a cruise around         
         Boston Harbor.         

03:41.021 --> 03:43.055
They say it's three hours       
      you'll never forget.      

03:43.123 --> 03:45.891
  Especially if it's low tide.  

03:45.959 --> 03:47.226
LILITH:                         
Woody,                          

03:47.293 --> 03:48.594
 it's hard to believe you grew  

03:48.661 --> 03:50.195
     such a hardy specimen      
          in the city.          

03:50.296 --> 03:53.198
Well, yeah, the trick           
is to give it lots of care.     

03:53.266 --> 03:54.500
                I took a seed   

03:54.567 --> 03:56.702
from last year's pumpkin,       
planted it,                     

03:56.770 --> 03:58.671
and watched over it             
like a daddy.                   

03:58.738 --> 04:00.973
I'd even lie in bed             
at night thinking,              

04:01.041 --> 04:02.908
"I wonder how                   
the pumpkin's doing."           

04:04.477 --> 04:07.980
Pruned it, weeded it,           
checked the soil.               

04:08.048 --> 04:10.416
I even talked to it.            

04:10.483 --> 04:12.518
    I think they like that.     

04:13.553 --> 04:15.054
        Aah!                    

04:16.488 --> 04:18.423
Farm boys love their Halloween! 

04:23.496 --> 04:24.863
I always hated this night.      

04:24.931 --> 04:26.865
                            Why?
Well, when I was a kid,         

04:26.933 --> 04:28.467
my folks used                   
to move around so much          

04:28.535 --> 04:30.269
that they never really got      
to know the neighbors,          

04:30.337 --> 04:31.704
so they didn't trust them.      

04:31.771 --> 04:34.006
So when all the other little    
kids had their costumes on,     

04:34.074 --> 04:35.240
and they were                   
trick-or-treating,              

04:35.308 --> 04:37.543
all I was allowed to do         
was stand at our front door     

04:37.610 --> 04:38.711
and pass out candies.           

04:38.778 --> 04:40.779
I could hardly wait             
till I was an adult,            

04:40.847 --> 04:42.314
so I could enjoy Halloween,     

04:42.382 --> 04:46.218
you know, and not spend all     
my time serving everybody else. 

04:46.286 --> 04:48.454
             Ah. That's too bad.

04:48.521 --> 04:50.456
            Could you pass those
            pretzels, please?   

04:51.758 --> 04:53.692
        (moaning):              
             Darn!              

04:58.198 --> 05:00.132
          I sympathize          
    with Rebecca's parents.     

05:00.200 --> 05:02.267
I, for one, will not            
allow my child                  

05:02.335 --> 05:05.404
to go trick-or-treating through 
the dangerous city streets.     

05:05.472 --> 05:06.739
        What luck!              

05:06.806 --> 05:09.008
I got the last Spider-Man       
     costume for Frederick!     

05:10.143 --> 05:12.077
                And look what he
            can use for webs.   

05:18.551 --> 05:20.419
Frasier, we need                
to have a discussion.           

05:22.222 --> 05:24.623
        Oh. no, don't tell me   

05:24.691 --> 05:27.593
                you have a thing
         against Halloween, too.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.396
I don't have a thing            
against Halloween.              

05:30.463 --> 05:31.964
I just don't                    
want my child                   

05:32.065 --> 05:33.932
panhandling door-to-door        

05:34.034 --> 05:35.834
accepting non-nutritious snacks 

05:35.902 --> 05:38.337
from strangers,                 
dressed in a silly costume.     

05:38.405 --> 05:41.173
                But, darling,   
              that <i>is</i> Halloween.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.042
    Oh.                         

05:43.109 --> 05:46.245
Well, then I guess              
I do have a thing against it.   

05:46.312 --> 05:47.579
         I got an idea.         

05:47.647 --> 05:49.214
      Why don't you bring       
  the little fella by the bar?  

05:49.282 --> 05:50.816
    We can, you know,           
  set up candy here and stuff.  

05:50.884 --> 05:52.017
    It'll be fun.               

05:52.085 --> 05:54.787
Well, I suppose                 

05:54.854 --> 05:57.456
if it's an environment          
which we know and trust,        

05:57.524 --> 05:58.991
that would be all right.        

05:59.059 --> 06:01.026
                I am not serving
        the little punk, Sam.   

06:01.094 --> 06:02.695
        I know.                 

06:02.762 --> 06:03.962
It's all right.                 

06:04.030 --> 06:05.297
Do me a favor.                  

06:05.365 --> 06:06.799
Will you take this over         
to Table Ten?                   

06:06.866 --> 06:08.801
                  Sure...       

06:09.869 --> 06:11.603
              All righty.       

06:11.671 --> 06:13.972
        (coins clinking)        

06:14.040 --> 06:15.874
     (jukebox plays jaunty      
        pop-rock intro)         

06:15.942 --> 06:17.376
        ¶ Let's do              
     the vampire twist... ¶     

06:17.444 --> 06:20.512
 Hey, that's not "Funky Town"!  

06:20.613 --> 06:23.148
        ¶ Do it ¶               

06:23.216 --> 06:25.117
          ¶ Yeah... ¶           

06:25.185 --> 06:27.486
          (shouting):           
    Turn it down, will you?

Oh... Oh, that's it, man.

     You know, this is just     
      the beginning, too.       

07:29.215 --> 07:30.616

                     Absolutely.
        Something               
          so horrible           

07:38.692 --> 07:40.426
that he'll never set foot

        Whatever the damages,   
            just write it in.

09:07.013 --> 09:08.647
             to call off all the
             pranks for tonight.

09:08.748 --> 09:09.882
What's going on here?           

09:09.949 --> 09:11.684
                 Well, I went to
                my doctor today.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.786
    He says I have abnormally   
            high blood pressure.

09:13.853 --> 09:15.354
                I'm 225 over 90.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.623
              Yeah, he also said
                if I don't start
                  taking it easy

09:17.691 --> 09:20.526
            soon, I could end up
        a lot worse, so you see,

09:20.627 --> 09:22.661
that's why we got to call off   
         everything for tonight.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.963
So this is not one              
of your pranks?                 

09:25.031 --> 09:27.032
    No, no, no, no-- Sam, I'm   
        on the level here, okay?

09:27.133 --> 09:28.367
        I'm really sorry        
    about everything, guys.     

09:28.435 --> 09:30.069
        A round of beers        
          on me, okay?          

09:30.136 --> 09:32.171
              Just add it to the
          check, Sam, all right?

      a lot more important

Wow, you're really              
a great guy, Sam.

Look, I got to go.              

09:43.283 --> 09:45.317
My wife's waiting               
in the car for me.

              after him tonight!

(laughing)                      

09:57.564 --> 10:00.232
            Sam, he just told   
                  you he's sick.

Honey, don't you see what       
he's trying to do?              

10:09.175 --> 10:10.242
He's getting me                 
to lower my guard.              

10:10.310 --> 10:11.477
Oh, this is good,               
this is good.                   

10:11.578 --> 10:13.245
All we got to figure out now is,

10:13.313 --> 10:14.780
  is something that'll really   
    spook him tonight.

                        Yeah.   

10:17.250 --> 10:19.551
      Well, Sam, how about using
        the old bloody thumb?   

10:19.619 --> 10:20.953
            That's pretty scary.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.055
Come on, man,                   
forget the old bloody thumb.    

10:23.123 --> 10:24.556
    No chump would              
    fall for that.              

10:24.624 --> 10:26.925
            (register rings)    
Oh, gee!                        

10:26.993 --> 10:29.294
              Helps to have     
             the right chump.   

10:30.964 --> 10:32.031
             Maybe you gentlemen
              should be thinking

10:32.098 --> 10:33.165
                 along the lines
                of high-tech.   

10:33.233 --> 10:34.233
    What do you mean?           

10:34.334 --> 10:35.934
            Well, a hologram.   

10:36.002 --> 10:37.269
You project                     
a three-dimensional             

10:37.370 --> 10:39.238
            translucent image of
        some ghoulish apparition

10:39.339 --> 10:41.273
              right into Gary's,

10:41.341 --> 10:43.108
             thereby scaring the
            bejeezus out of 'em.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.176
                     Where'd you
                  get that idea?

10:44.310 --> 10:45.644
                 Well, actually,

10:45.712 --> 10:47.913
  Lilith and her physics friends
      pulled it on me last year.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.749
        Geez, I must have pulled
      out five fistfuls of hair.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.151
Hee, hee, hee...                

10:53.420 --> 10:55.587

    guys, a hologram?

        everyone.               

11:09.235 --> 11:10.936
            Well, rather than   
                 let Freddy have

11:11.037 --> 11:13.472
         all the fun, we decided
         to get dressed up, too.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.207
                Who are you guys
                 supposed to be?

11:15.275 --> 11:17.209
See, Frasier, I told you        
they wouldn't know.             

11:19.079 --> 11:22.448
                 Well, I'm Dante
            Gabriel Rossetti!   

11:24.117 --> 11:26.618
And I'm his sister,             
Christina.                      

11:28.455 --> 11:30.422
The Rossettis are               
our favorite figures            

11:30.490 --> 11:32.358
from the Pre-Raphaelite         
Brotherhood.                    

11:32.425 --> 11:33.659
             CLIFF:             
        Oh, yeah.               

11:33.760 --> 11:35.594
The Pre-Raphaelites.            
                         Yeah?  

11:35.662 --> 11:38.697
Yeah, a group of 19th century   
artists and writers             

11:38.765 --> 11:42.401
who held an almost-childlike    
submission to nature.           

11:42.469 --> 11:43.502
That's very good, Cliff.        

11:43.570 --> 11:45.137
How would you ever              
come to know that?              

11:45.238 --> 11:47.439
Ah, I came across it            
at the library.                 

11:47.507 --> 11:49.041
                     Yeah, going
            through art books   

11:49.109 --> 11:52.244
        looking for paintings   
            of naked babes, huh?

11:52.312 --> 11:54.413
Really liked 'em                
fat back then, didn't they?     

11:56.449 --> 11:58.050
        Freddy is, of course,   

11:58.118 --> 12:00.419
            bedecked in the garb
      of superhero crime fighter

12:00.487 --> 12:02.421
          Spider-Man.           

12:04.090 --> 12:05.791
            LILITH:             
         Interestingly,         

12:05.859 --> 12:08.594
Spider-Man acquired             
his supernatural powers         

12:08.661 --> 12:10.696
from the bite                   
of a radioactive spider.        

12:10.797 --> 12:11.964
I tried to explain              

12:12.032 --> 12:13.332
to Frederick what would         
happen if one were              

12:13.533 --> 12:15.501
really bitten                   
by a radioactive spider,        

12:15.568 --> 12:16.835
but he just cried.              

12:18.672 --> 12:20.272
                Okay, Fred, time
             for trick or treat.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.340
        Trick or treat, lady.   

12:21.441 --> 12:22.675
          Here we go.           

12:22.742 --> 12:25.277
Oh, thank you.                  
Thank you.                      

12:25.345 --> 12:27.546
  Hey, mister, trick or treat.  

12:27.614 --> 12:29.014
Thank you very much.            

12:29.082 --> 12:30.883
Oh, look.                       

12:30.984 --> 12:32.951
            I'd like to tell you
        something, young man.   

12:33.019 --> 12:35.320
I don't know if you realize how 
lucky you are that your parents 

12:35.388 --> 12:37.423
 let you partake in the better  
      things of childhood.      

12:37.490 --> 12:39.892
        You know, I never got   
              to trick or treat.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.627
          I always had          
     to hand out the candy.     

12:41.695 --> 12:43.796
 Nobody ever gave me any candy. 

12:48.335 --> 12:50.803
          Look at that...       

12:50.870 --> 12:52.071
    Good boy, Freddy.           

12:52.172 --> 12:54.039
                  Thank you.    

12:54.107 --> 12:56.675
That's the first time anybody   
          ever gave me anything.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.711
        Thank you, Frederick.   

13:00.613 --> 13:02.314
                 The kid's got a
             bagful of Snickers,

13:02.382 --> 13:04.149
                 and he gives me
                  a Tootsie Pop.

13:06.252 --> 13:08.587
             Oh, boy, do we have
            a surprise for Gary.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.322
SAM:                            
Those physics guys              

13:10.390 --> 13:12.491
set up the whole thing;         
the hologram's incredible.      

13:12.559 --> 13:14.560
      What macabre specter      
    will they be projecting?    

13:14.627 --> 13:18.564
    Carla's disembodied head    
     floating over the bar.     

13:18.665 --> 13:20.265
      (muttering approval)      

13:20.333 --> 13:21.767
    Scary, huh, Norm?           
                        Yeah.   

13:21.835 --> 13:24.169
What would you do if you saw    
Carla's disembodied head        

13:24.237 --> 13:25.437
floating over the bar?          

13:25.505 --> 13:26.538
            What I always do.   

13:26.606 --> 13:28.007
         Call a cab and go home.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.385
          Oh, my Lord!          

13:39.452 --> 13:42.421
                        FRASIER:
        That would scare even   
        the most heartiest soul.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.360
    Oh...                       

13:48.428 --> 13:50.796
It's like being in              
a haunted house, isn't it?      

13:50.897 --> 13:53.399
A haunted house with free taps. 

13:54.934 --> 13:56.969
          I can't wait          
     for Gary to see this.      

13:57.037 --> 13:58.604
         He's gonna             
     really freak out.          

13:58.672 --> 14:00.873
        (chuckles)              

14:00.940 --> 14:02.474
Oh, here he is now.             

14:03.209 --> 14:04.643
                 Wow!           

14:04.711 --> 14:06.645
                He was so scared
                  he passed out.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.981
    Gee, I wonder what          
         we should do.          

14:09.082 --> 14:10.616
 Well, I think the responsible  
      thing to do would be      

14:10.684 --> 14:12.484
        to bring him to         
    and then, uh, run.          

14:12.552 --> 14:13.752
          (all laugh)           

14:14.988 --> 14:16.388
                      Hey, guys,

14:16.456 --> 14:18.657
            what if the blood   
        pressure stuff was true?

14:18.725 --> 14:20.092
              I mean, that could
                be dangerous.   

14:20.160 --> 14:21.427
Oh, come on,                    
give me a break.                

14:21.494 --> 14:22.628
He was faking.                  

14:22.696 --> 14:23.762
He's probably faking now.       

14:23.830 --> 14:25.431
Come on,                        
Gary, get up.                   

14:25.498 --> 14:26.699
I don't think he can, Sam.      

14:26.766 --> 14:28.500
     I don't feel a pulse.      

14:28.568 --> 14:30.602
      Oh, come on, you got      
         to be kidding.         

14:30.704 --> 14:32.338
            No, Sam.            

14:32.405 --> 14:33.706
          Gary's dead.          

14:43.583 --> 14:44.883
                Good morning!   

14:45.051 --> 14:46.151
                          CLIFF:
                Morning, Sam.   

14:46.219 --> 14:47.953
    It's a dark day.            

14:48.088 --> 14:49.588
          Oh, come on.          

14:49.656 --> 14:52.024
 You don't really believe that  
      Gary's dead, do you?      

14:52.092 --> 14:53.726
     (gasps):                   
     Do you?                    

14:55.061 --> 14:57.396
FRASIER:                        
I beg your pardon.              

14:57.464 --> 14:58.430
You were there.                 

14:58.498 --> 14:59.999
You saw with your own           
eyes what happened.             

15:00.066 --> 15:02.134
              This is Gary we're
                  talking about.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.369
            You can't trust him.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.636
                 Ever.          

15:04.704 --> 15:05.971
He's pulling a stunt.           

15:06.039 --> 15:07.139
             CARLA:             
         But the police         

15:07.207 --> 15:09.408
        and the coroner         
    confirmed it, Sam.          

15:09.476 --> 15:10.843
            Oh, no.             

15:10.910 --> 15:13.145
    No, he-he could've          
    hired them to trick us.     

15:13.279 --> 15:15.514
FRASIER:                        
Sam, I realize that             

15:15.615 --> 15:17.750
        Gary's death is         
     very traumatic for you     

15:17.817 --> 15:19.284
  and you're-you're obviously   
        in denial.              

15:19.352 --> 15:21.620
                No, I am not.   

15:23.156 --> 15:25.157
I can't believe you guys.       

15:25.225 --> 15:26.358
      I'll tell you what.       

15:26.426 --> 15:27.693
     I'll believe he's dead     

15:27.761 --> 15:29.028
as soon as they bury him.       

15:29.129 --> 15:32.097
        Gary's funeral's        
    at 2:00 this afternoon.     

15:33.566 --> 15:36.001
      This is a good one.       
      This is a good one.       

15:36.102 --> 15:38.137
              Life is so unfair.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.440
Yes, Woody, very often          
we feel that way                

15:41.508 --> 15:44.510
when someone close              
to us passes on.                

15:46.613 --> 15:49.181
        I'm talking about the   
        pumpkin carving contest.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.184
                  I mean, it had
                    to be fixed.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.519
                You should've   
                seen the winner.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.054
                     Teeth going
                every which way,

15:55.155 --> 15:58.023
    uneven eyes, stupid nose.   

15:58.091 --> 15:59.958
            You should have seen
             this kid's pumpkin.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.563
            Sam?                

16:04.664 --> 16:06.365
MATT:                           
Good morning.                   

16:06.466 --> 16:10.069
    I'm Matt, the bartender     
      from over at Gary's.      

16:10.136 --> 16:12.538
             Yeah?              

16:12.605 --> 16:14.540
  We're all kind of in shock,   
     but I thought I should     

16:14.607 --> 16:15.974
      come by and give you      
      something from Gary.      

16:16.042 --> 16:18.544
         This is good.          
        Watch this one.         

16:18.611 --> 16:21.480
         Oh, the bowling trophy.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.015
    Gary's prized possession.   

16:23.083 --> 16:25.017
MATT:                           
Gary came back                  

16:25.085 --> 16:27.119
from seeing you yesterday, Sam, 
and all he could talk about     

16:27.187 --> 16:28.787
was how concerned you were      
over his condition.             

16:28.855 --> 16:30.122
He was pretty                   
touched that                    

16:30.223 --> 16:31.957
after all this time             
of being rivals,                

16:32.025 --> 16:34.660
when it counted most,           
you really cared about him.     

16:42.836 --> 16:46.872
  That is so sweet and so sad.  

16:46.940 --> 16:49.375
          Oh, come on!          
        Give me a break!        

16:49.442 --> 16:52.177
The guy is probably hanging out 
     around here someplace.     

16:52.245 --> 16:53.812
      Hey, what're you up       
      at Melville's, Gary?      

16:53.880 --> 16:55.014
         Come on down!          

16:55.081 --> 16:56.281
        (chuckles)              

16:56.349 --> 16:58.951
Wow, you are                    
cold, man.                      

17:00.053 --> 17:01.653
      I was gonna ask you       
        for a job,              

17:01.721 --> 17:03.689
but pfft!-- forget it now.      

17:06.259 --> 17:07.358
        Now, he's good.         

17:07.426 --> 17:08.694
    He is really good.          

17:10.096 --> 17:11.696
                        REBECCA:
                Sam, stop it.   

17:11.765 --> 17:12.964
            The game is over.   

17:13.032 --> 17:14.733
         A man is dead.         

17:14.800 --> 17:17.036
     You know, it's getting     
a little bit embarrassing.      

17:17.103 --> 17:19.972
    It's time for you to face   
     the fact that Gary is dead.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.607
             That you had a hand
                in his death.   

17:21.675 --> 17:22.741
                     We all did.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.108
        That's the end of it.   

17:24.176 --> 17:26.145
Yeah, maybe you're right.       

17:26.212 --> 17:28.480
     All right, I admit it.     

17:28.548 --> 17:30.082
     Waah-waah, he's dead.      

17:30.150 --> 17:31.083
      (laughs)                  

17:31.151 --> 17:32.551
Come on, you guys.              

17:32.619 --> 17:34.420
Lookit, he's bluffing.          

17:34.487 --> 17:36.955
  I wonder how far he's really  
going to take this thing.       

17:38.291 --> 17:39.825
I'll be he's not even in there. 

17:43.630 --> 17:45.564
    Okay, so he's in there.     

17:50.570 --> 17:51.837
                I still think   
                it's a trick.   

17:51.905 --> 17:53.806
      If he wants to stay       
    in there and suffocate,     

17:53.873 --> 17:55.474
              it's fine with me;
            it's his funeral.   

17:55.542 --> 17:57.009
             Oh...              

17:57.110 --> 17:59.345
    Sam, we'd like you          
      to be a pallbearer.       

17:59.446 --> 18:01.313
         Well, why me?          

18:01.381 --> 18:02.781
          I mean, Gary hated me.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.050
It's a shame you never knew how 
  much he thought of you, Sam.  

18:05.118 --> 18:07.653
                He thrived on   
            your competition.   

18:07.721 --> 18:09.888
        You brought him life.   

18:09.956 --> 18:11.890
Then you took it away.          

18:13.460 --> 18:15.294
         I don't want to be     
        a pallbearer.           

18:15.362 --> 18:16.595
                        FRASIER:
                            Sam,

18:16.663 --> 18:18.997
                  it's the least
                you could do.   

18:24.037 --> 18:25.971
        Oh, I know what         
    he's going to do.           

18:26.039 --> 18:27.406
        All right,              
we're walking along here,       

18:27.474 --> 18:29.108
        all of a sudden,        
      the coffin opens up,      

18:29.175 --> 18:30.642
         he reaches out         
    and grabs my hand.          

18:30.710 --> 18:33.645
          Yeah, right.          
Ooh-ooh, I'm scared, yeah.      

18:33.713 --> 18:35.647
Come on, Gare, I got you.       
    Come on, open up.           

18:35.715 --> 18:37.483
    (knocks on coffin)          
Hello? Come on out, Gary.       

18:38.952 --> 18:40.953
(owl hooting in distance)       

18:54.234 --> 18:56.335
         Come on, Gary.         
        Enough's enough.        

18:56.403 --> 18:58.504
 It's getting chilly out here.  

18:58.571 --> 19:00.506
                          CLIFF:
                          Sammy?
              Hmm?              

19:00.573 --> 19:02.207
          Come on, the funeral's
            been over for hours.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.276
 No, no, you don't understand.  
  See, that's the whole thing   

19:04.344 --> 19:05.644
     about practical jokes,     
          it's timing.          

19:05.712 --> 19:07.646
  I know this; I've done this   
    a thousand times before.    

19:07.714 --> 19:09.448
        Matter of fact,         
if I don't miss my guess,       

19:09.516 --> 19:11.016
     he'll be coming out...     

19:11.084 --> 19:13.619
      right about... now.       

19:14.921 --> 19:16.121
        Right about now.        

19:17.323 --> 19:18.657
            Come on,            
    you're milking it, Gary!    

19:18.825 --> 19:20.092
    Get out of there!           

19:20.193 --> 19:22.361
                        FRASIER:
              I don't think he's
                coming out, Sam.

19:22.429 --> 19:24.630
    Yeah? Well, then I'm...     
      I'm digging him out.      

19:24.698 --> 19:26.765
         Come on, Gary.         
            Come on.            

19:26.833 --> 19:28.434
No, you don't understand.       
        This is a stunt.        

19:28.535 --> 19:29.835
      No, come on, you can      
    hear him laughing.          

19:29.903 --> 19:30.803
        He's laughing--         
          I hear you!           

19:30.870 --> 19:31.804
        You're laughing,        
          I know that!          

19:40.280 --> 19:42.247
     Okay, Gary, I'm back.      

19:42.315 --> 19:43.782
        You can come out        
    and scare me now.           

19:43.850 --> 19:46.185
        Shh-shh! Watch.         

19:46.252 --> 19:49.088
    Oh, Sam, he's not here.     

19:51.958 --> 19:53.892
            Oh, my God...       

19:56.262 --> 19:58.397
    What if he's really dead?   

19:58.465 --> 20:01.266
The thought has                 
occurred to me, Sam.            

20:05.372 --> 20:07.272
                 He's gone.     

20:07.340 --> 20:08.907
            He's really gone.   

20:08.975 --> 20:11.810
Gary had to go out              
of his way to prove it to you,  

20:11.878 --> 20:14.279
but, yes, Sam,                  
he's gone.                      

20:14.347 --> 20:18.150
     I feel like I've lost      
        my best friend.         

20:18.251 --> 20:19.985
             CARLA:             
    Having Gary around          

20:20.086 --> 20:22.121
              was, like, the one
            thing that always   

20:22.188 --> 20:24.923
            seemed to pull us   
            together as a group.

20:24.991 --> 20:28.327
Yeah. Gary really brought out   
the best in us, huh?            

20:28.428 --> 20:30.996
  No, Cliffie, he brought out   
        the worst in us.        

20:31.064 --> 20:32.464
    He will be missed.          

20:34.000 --> 20:36.001
      Boy, I'll tell you,       
I've done a lot of things       

20:36.069 --> 20:39.204
 that I regret, but I'll never  
be able to make up for this one.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.973
                    You know,   
            maybe it's time I   

20:41.107 --> 20:43.142
         stopped acting         
    like an overgrown child.    

20:43.209 --> 20:46.645
 I mean, a man is dead because  
  I did not have the maturity   

20:46.713 --> 20:47.846
     to know when to stop.      

20:47.947 --> 20:50.015
Never thought                   
I'd say this, but...            

20:50.083 --> 20:51.116
          I miss Gary.          

20:51.184 --> 20:53.118
 He's a... he's a true friend.  

20:54.354 --> 20:55.988
      That would have made      
      a better eulogy than      

20:56.056 --> 20:58.290
"Get out of there, Gary."       

21:04.631 --> 21:06.865
        I feel so empty.        

21:06.966 --> 21:08.834
            (crying)            

21:10.670 --> 21:12.504
                          WOODY:
                      Excuse me.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.306
    (continues crying)          

21:14.374 --> 21:15.974
SAM:                            
Woody, come,                    
come back here.                 

21:17.210 --> 21:19.178
      Oh, come on, Woody.       

21:19.245 --> 21:20.579
    God, it's all my fault.     

21:20.647 --> 21:22.581
    (Woody sobs loudly          
          in distance)          

21:24.084 --> 21:26.352
Hey, Woody, come on, man.       

21:26.453 --> 21:29.188
      You, you don't want to cry
        by yourself in there.   

21:29.289 --> 21:31.690
     Come on, come on, man.     

21:31.758 --> 21:33.759
Come on, listen,                
hey, hey, listen to me.         

21:33.827 --> 21:34.860
  Listen to me.                 

21:34.928 --> 21:36.362
We all feel bad.                

21:36.429 --> 21:37.396
    (crying continues)          

21:37.464 --> 21:38.530
                 Do you, Malone?

21:38.598 --> 21:40.432
                  Do you really?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.467
            (laughs)            

21:45.905 --> 21:47.406
        Trick or treat!         

21:51.177 --> 21:54.013
        You... you were         
     all in this together?      

21:54.080 --> 21:57.516
 Hey, the whole city of Boston  
    was in on this one, Sam.    

21:57.584 --> 22:00.419
    Come on, you're supposed    
    to be on my side.           

22:00.520 --> 22:03.022
    It was really funny, Sam.   

22:04.124 --> 22:05.190
        Yeah, but you're        

22:05.258 --> 22:06.759
my pal, man.                    
Come on!                        

22:06.826 --> 22:09.561
  It was really, really funny!  

22:09.629 --> 22:12.431
Sammy, I told you.              
I told you we wanted to be      

22:12.499 --> 22:14.566
on the winning end              
of a great scam.                

22:14.634 --> 22:15.701
That was a clue.                

22:15.769 --> 22:17.069
      Yeah, but you never       
          really gave           

22:17.137 --> 22:20.072
    that Chinese food thing     
        a chance.               

22:22.308 --> 22:24.710
     Hey, too bad you can't     
    get back at me, Malone,     

22:24.778 --> 22:26.345
but you're a big boy now.       

22:26.413 --> 22:30.182
 You don't want to play pretend 
 'cause people could get hurt.  

22:30.250 --> 22:32.351
            Whoops!             
This, I believe, is mine.       

22:32.419 --> 22:33.419
                            SAM:
                Oh, no, wait!   

22:33.520 --> 22:35.421
         Hey, the game          
    is not over, Gary!          

22:35.488 --> 22:36.955
     Hey, listen, I'm going     
    to find something           

22:37.057 --> 22:38.457
                to scare you.   
            I swear to God I am!

22:38.525 --> 22:40.192
            Here, use this, Sam.
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.          

22:40.260 --> 22:42.594
         Bloody thumb!          
         Bloody thumb!          

22:42.662 --> 22:45.064
          Whoo! Whoo!
