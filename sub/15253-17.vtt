<i>. I'm Chuck. Here are a few ings
you might need to know:</i>

00:02.949 --> 00:03.932
I have nothing to do with

00:03.933 --> 00:05.534
<i>. I'm exei Volkoff--e a few I
haven't seen him in years.:</i>

00:05.535 --> 00:08.304
Then why does he pay r the manor that
you live in? Because I'm his daughter.

00:08.371 --> 00:09.872
<i>. I'm My fatheroff--e a few I
hanever gave me any key.s.:</i>

00:09.939 --> 00:11.340
Yes, sweetheart, he did.

a token of his affection.</i>

01:02.491 --> 01:04.525
I give up.

01:04.593 --> 01:06.027
Strange reaction.

01:06.094 --> 01:09.430
Most people show a bit more enthusiasm

01:09.498 --> 01:13.835
when they receive a gift.

01:13.902 --> 01:16.204
Sorry. Who are you?

01:16.271 --> 01:17.572
My name is Riley.

01:17.639 --> 01:19.974
I'm your father's lawyer.

01:20.042 --> 01:22.810
You father

01:22.878 --> 01:26.130
left a letter for you.

01:30.335 --> 01:32.687
"My dearest daughter Vivian,

01:32.754 --> 01:34.956
"as you know,

01:35.023 --> 01:37.291
"I've met an untimely demise...

01:37.359 --> 01:39.293
Sorry. "I..."

01:39.361 --> 01:40.995
What are you doing?

01:41.063 --> 01:44.065
He specified that I read
the letter in his voice.

01:44.132 --> 01:47.668
He thought it would make
you feel comfortable.

01:47.736 --> 01:48.870
Please stop.

01:48.937 --> 01:52.874
I spent several weeks perfecting this.

01:52.941 --> 01:54.842
But fine.

01:54.910 --> 01:56.744
Uh...

01:56.812 --> 02:00.314
"I'm sorry I was never much of a father.

02:00.382 --> 02:03.317
"If I could do it over again,

02:03.385 --> 02:07.021
"I would trade my entire empire
for another moment with you..."

02:10.392 --> 02:11.993
"but we can't relive the past,

02:12.060 --> 02:14.762
"which is why I have
groomed you for the future.

02:14.830 --> 02:18.332
"That card in my safe

02:18.400 --> 02:21.719
will help you rebuild Volkoff Industries..."

02:21.803 --> 02:24.338
Mr. Riley, I'm well aware that my father

02:24.406 --> 02:28.743
now wants me to take over
his evil corporation.

02:28.810 --> 02:30.778
So how can I say no?

02:30.846 --> 02:32.280
Hmm.

02:32.347 --> 02:34.732
No.

02:34.816 --> 02:36.584
Nobody ever said no to your father.

02:36.652 --> 02:39.720
Than I'll be the first to do it.

02:39.788 --> 02:40.788
I'm sorry.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.657
I can't allow that.

02:44.409 --> 02:46.994
Now perhaps you'd like
to rethink your answer.

03:05.948 --> 03:08.582
Okay, roses or orchids?

03:08.634 --> 03:10.952
Uh, I don't know.

03:11.019 --> 03:12.386
Uh, roses?

03:12.437 --> 03:13.771
What do you think?

03:13.855 --> 03:17.692
I think that flowers can really
set the tone of a wedding.

03:17.759 --> 03:19.493
you know, roses are-- are beautiful,

03:19.561 --> 03:21.228
they're classic, they're passionate.

03:21.296 --> 03:22.964
Not very whimsical.

03:23.031 --> 03:24.899
And that's good?

03:24.967 --> 03:26.734
If it's what you want.

03:26.802 --> 03:28.703
Uh, okay.

03:28.770 --> 03:31.772
Uh, well... Orchids?

03:31.823 --> 03:34.775
Sorry. Sarah...

03:34.826 --> 03:36.410
I'm sorry. I-I just--

03:36.461 --> 03:38.112
I don't have a strong feeling either way.

03:38.180 --> 03:40.348
I just don't think that
maybe I'm cut out for this.

03:40.415 --> 03:41.749
What if you just make the choices?

03:41.817 --> 03:43.918
Okay, you know what?

03:43.986 --> 03:45.303
Maybe-- maybe this girly stuff

03:45.387 --> 03:48.339
is a little outside your comfort zone.

03:48.423 --> 03:50.157
I will tell you that, at some point,

03:50.225 --> 03:52.627
every bride feels a little
overwhelmed with this stuff.

03:52.694 --> 03:54.428
I totally did.

03:54.496 --> 03:56.864
But there was a moment
where that all changed.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.500
I remember I had gone to
pick up our wedding bands

03:59.568 --> 04:02.003
and I finally held them in my hands.

04:02.070 --> 04:03.938
And it all just became so real.

04:04.006 --> 04:05.139
I was getting married

04:05.207 --> 04:10.311
to the man that I love,
for the rest of my life.

04:10.379 --> 04:13.214
And then I just broke down crying,

04:13.281 --> 04:15.216
which sounds ridiculous right now.

04:15.283 --> 04:16.483
Yeah, a little.

04:16.551 --> 04:18.019
A lot.

04:18.086 --> 04:19.887
But it was a turning point, you know.

04:19.954 --> 04:24.158
From that moment on,
everything became magical.

04:24.226 --> 04:26.927
It was my wedding.

04:26.995 --> 04:29.463
I don't know when and I
don't know where, Sarah,

04:29.531 --> 04:33.000
but I promise you,
it's going to happen to you.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.174
You know what?

04:40.242 --> 04:42.309
New apartment,
I'm going to go no television.

04:42.377 --> 04:44.045
It will be very liberating.

04:47.416 --> 04:49.283
Kidding. I'm totally kidding.

04:49.351 --> 04:51.018
72 inches, dude. Bam.

04:51.069 --> 04:54.588
I was honestly about to smack you right now.

04:54.656 --> 04:57.708
So how is the apartment
hunting going, anyway?

04:57.793 --> 05:00.928
It's uh... Oh, man,
it couldn't be going better.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.830
I found a place. A little pricey.

05:02.898 --> 05:05.399
So I'm looking for a roommate right now.

05:05.467 --> 05:07.034
Well, that shouldn't be a problem,
right? I hope not.

05:07.085 --> 05:08.602
And you know what, in the meantime,

05:08.670 --> 05:10.370
it's kind of nice being at my mom's.

05:10.422 --> 05:13.224
Buddy, I gotta say, I'm, uh,
I'm a little relieved.

05:13.308 --> 05:15.142
Chuck, this is needed on my part, okay?

05:15.210 --> 05:19.313
I am growing mentally and
emotionally, physically--

05:19.381 --> 05:20.815
not so much physically.

05:20.882 --> 05:23.417
But some people are saying
that I'm acting taller.

05:25.437 --> 05:27.238
Uh,I gotta get down to Castle.

05:27.322 --> 05:30.057
Buddy, I'm so glad that
everything's going so well.

05:30.125 --> 05:31.358
You're killing it.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.395
Have a great day.

05:34.463 --> 05:36.113
Talk to you soon.

05:38.366 --> 05:39.450
Hey, son.

05:39.534 --> 05:40.618
Sleep okay last night?

05:40.702 --> 05:43.120
No. No, I did not.

05:43.205 --> 05:46.290
Those cats outside the
window are just so loud.

05:46.374 --> 05:47.374
They gave me nightmares.

05:47.442 --> 05:49.810
Yeah, cats.

05:49.878 --> 05:51.879
Just a heads up-- Mm-hmm.

05:51.947 --> 05:54.582
those cats are having a
romantic dinner tonight.

05:54.649 --> 05:56.751
And there might be more cat fighting

05:56.818 --> 05:59.220
after dinner ends.

05:59.287 --> 06:00.771
Unless your mom eats too much.

06:00.856 --> 06:04.258
Listen, I don't want to think
about you and my mom doing...

06:04.309 --> 06:07.461
making a... slipping and...

06:07.529 --> 06:09.230
Son, when you move into the forest,

06:09.281 --> 06:11.899
you can't complain that the
wildlife is making too much noise.

06:11.967 --> 06:13.834
It's only natural.

06:13.902 --> 06:14.869
And beautiful.

06:15.637 --> 06:16.570
And frequent.

06:16.621 --> 06:18.105
I need my own place. Yes, you do.

06:19.875 --> 06:21.876
So then you went to Volkoff's headquarters

06:21.943 --> 06:24.645
and you were attacked? Yes.

06:24.713 --> 06:25.963
I shouldn't have gone to Moscow.

06:26.047 --> 06:27.465
I don't know what I was thinking.

06:27.549 --> 06:29.150
It's okay. You're safe here.

06:29.217 --> 06:30.468
Now, this man Riley--

06:30.552 --> 06:32.419
he wants you to rebuild
your father's empire?

06:32.487 --> 06:33.487
Yes.

06:33.555 --> 06:34.922
But I told him I don't want

06:34.990 --> 06:36.590
to have anything to do with my father.

06:36.658 --> 06:39.360
Did he happen to say what his
plan for rebuilding Volkoff was?

06:39.427 --> 06:42.263
I think this may have
something to do with it.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.675
We need to talk to Beckman.

06:54.743 --> 06:58.212
in the First Bank of Macau.
So Volkoff has all of his money

06:58.280 --> 06:59.547
We need to freeze those funds.

06:59.614 --> 07:00.848
We do.

07:00.916 --> 07:03.784
is no easy target.
But the First Bank of Macau

07:03.852 --> 07:06.153
Guan Yi Crime Syndicate.
it's really operated by the

07:06.221 --> 07:09.039
The guards are mercenaries.

07:09.124 --> 07:12.293
inside of there before. We've lost agents

07:12.344 --> 07:14.995
holder working with us.
But we've never had an account

07:15.063 --> 07:17.531
the perfect asset. That makes Vivian

07:17.599 --> 07:19.433
we'll be able to get through With her help,

07:19.501 --> 07:20.568
the bank's security

07:20.635 --> 07:23.137
and access her father's account.
Um, General,

07:23.205 --> 07:28.542
I'm not so sure that Vivian is really built

07:28.610 --> 07:31.245
for this sort of mission, you know.

07:31.313 --> 07:33.513
Not to mention the fact
that she was pretty clear

07:33.565 --> 07:35.983
about never wanting to see her father again.

07:36.051 --> 07:37.985
to change all that. Well, it's your job

07:38.053 --> 07:39.987
You're a spy, she's an asset.

07:40.055 --> 07:41.722
going to work, If this mission is

07:41.790 --> 07:44.708
you need to turn that girl into a Volkoff.

seeks roommate ASAP.

08:34.225 --> 08:37.360
No, Morgan, don't lead with the beard, okay?

08:37.412 --> 08:39.111
Let it be a pleasant surprise.

08:39.197 --> 08:40.563
Morgan.

08:40.615 --> 08:42.749
Hey buddy. You look sharp.

08:42.833 --> 08:45.419
Listen, um, you're
obviously a worldly fellow.

08:45.503 --> 08:48.238
I was wondering if you could
settle a little debate

08:48.289 --> 08:49.289
betwixt us.

08:49.373 --> 08:50.507
Where do you think

08:50.575 --> 08:52.776
would be the best place to meet ladies--

08:52.844 --> 08:56.613
a Renaissance Fair--
right? Or a methadone clinic?

08:57.982 --> 08:59.649
It's okay if the ladies are really ugly.

08:59.717 --> 09:01.584
Really? I don't... I don't...
a Renaissance Fair.

09:01.636 --> 09:02.886
Okay, interesting.

09:02.937 --> 09:04.654
Next question-- can we have two weeks off

09:04.722 --> 09:06.089
to to go a Renaissance Fair?

09:06.157 --> 09:07.090
Not a chance.

09:07.141 --> 09:08.425
See?

09:08.493 --> 09:09.693
Look, I don't have time to discuss it.

09:09.760 --> 09:10.994
I'm in the middle of a housing crisis

09:11.062 --> 09:12.696
and I need to find a place now.

09:12.763 --> 09:14.464
Really? Dude, dude.

09:14.532 --> 09:17.267
We have an extra room in
our apartment-slash-van.

09:17.335 --> 09:18.869
So how about this?

09:18.936 --> 09:22.772
A place to statay in exchange f,
say, one week off.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.608
Hmm.

09:24.675 --> 09:27.043
Huh? No.

09:27.111 --> 09:30.046
Manager to register seven, please.

09:30.114 --> 09:31.364
Okay, I'm not... I'm done here.

09:31.449 --> 09:32.816
Thank you for the offer,

09:32.884 --> 09:33.884
but no thank you.

09:33.951 --> 09:35.485
"Slash-van."

09:35.553 --> 09:37.654
See yourselves out, please.

09:37.705 --> 09:40.457
He's a heartbreaker; a soul crusher.

09:40.508 --> 09:44.994
I'm going to pin that guy
down and shave his beard.

09:46.347 --> 09:47.797
Hmm.

09:47.865 --> 09:50.734
It looks like Morgan's potential
roommates are meeting him here.

09:50.801 --> 09:53.687
Morgan won't let us go
to the Renaissance Fair,

09:53.771 --> 09:58.175
we'll bring the Renaissance Fair to us.

09:59.610 --> 10:02.145
I have no idea what you're doing right now.

10:02.213 --> 10:04.931
So you want me to help you
break into my father's bank.

10:04.999 --> 10:06.583
Absolutely not.

10:06.651 --> 10:09.352
I've had way too many guns
pointed at me recently.

10:09.420 --> 10:12.322
We'll be there to protect
you the entire time.

10:12.390 --> 10:14.824
Look, most years I saw my father maybe once.

10:14.892 --> 10:17.694
The longest conversation we've
ever had is ten minutes.

10:17.762 --> 10:18.762
I get that, I do.

10:18.829 --> 10:20.764
Believe me, I understand.

10:20.831 --> 10:22.716
So your father was a criminal mastermind

10:22.800 --> 10:24.334
who forgot your last five birthdays, too?

10:24.402 --> 10:26.002
No, um...

10:26.070 --> 10:29.206
but he did leave me when I was 13 years old.

10:29.273 --> 10:31.174
I'm sorry.

10:31.242 --> 10:32.375
It's okay.

10:32.443 --> 10:34.344
You know, for the longest time,

10:34.412 --> 10:36.780
all I ever wanted to do was
ask him the same questions

10:36.847 --> 10:39.015
that I know are swirling
around in your head right now.

10:39.083 --> 10:40.383
Why'd you leave?

10:40.451 --> 10:43.620
Why didn't you ever even make
an attempt to contact me?

10:43.688 --> 10:46.690
You ever get to ask him?

10:46.757 --> 10:48.225
Yeah.

10:48.292 --> 10:51.828
And I learned that even though
my father wasn't around,

10:51.896 --> 10:54.698
it didn't mean he wasn't thinking about me.

10:54.765 --> 10:58.134
Look, I don't know what you'll find out,

10:58.202 --> 11:00.237
but I can guarantee you that if you help us,

11:00.304 --> 11:02.706
we can help you find at
least some of the answers

11:02.773 --> 11:05.108
that you're looking for.

11:06.811 --> 11:07.978
<i>When the thugs</i>

11:08.045 --> 11:10.964
running the bank meet Volkoff's daughter,

11:11.048 --> 11:12.716
they're gonna be expecting
someone intimidating.

11:12.767 --> 11:16.770
And your current outfit doesn't
really scream "bad guy."

11:16.854 --> 11:19.356
I wasn't exactly planning
on infiltrating a bank

11:19.423 --> 11:20.890
when I got dressed this morning.

11:20.942 --> 11:22.759
Well, we can fix that. Smile.

11:25.696 --> 11:27.364
It's kind of like J. Crew for spies.

11:34.205 --> 11:37.941
- Wow.
- Yeah.

11:38.009 --> 11:39.409
It's also got some really cool

11:39.477 --> 11:41.845
makeover features that are built in,
in case you want

11:41.912 --> 11:43.413
to do a full... Not that I've ever...

11:43.481 --> 11:45.615
Anyway...

11:50.554 --> 11:51.955
Go ahead, try it on.

11:55.860 --> 11:57.861
So, meet me in the armory when she's done.

11:57.928 --> 12:00.647
Yeah. One sec, though.
I want to show you something.

12:02.833 --> 12:04.334
What do you think?

12:04.402 --> 12:06.136
It's a little formal for a bank job.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.705
You know what? You're right,
it is formal for a bank job.

12:08.773 --> 12:11.207
What do you think of it,
I don't know, for our wedding?

12:11.275 --> 12:12.742
Oh! Oh, the wedding!

12:12.810 --> 12:14.995
Yeah! Yeah, you'll look great in that.

12:15.079 --> 12:16.913
Very, very handsome.

12:16.981 --> 12:18.348
What's going on?

12:18.416 --> 12:20.050
What's wrong? Something's wrong with you.

12:20.117 --> 12:21.785
'Cause you love me in a black tie.

12:21.852 --> 12:24.487
It's just that this is not really my thing,

12:24.538 --> 12:26.856
and I feel like I'm letting you guys down.

12:26.924 --> 12:28.158
You're not letting anybody down.

12:30.428 --> 12:31.528
Was that Casey?

12:31.595 --> 12:32.629
Yeah.

12:34.215 --> 12:36.165
Casey! Hey! Casey!

12:36.217 --> 12:37.667
Yo, what's going on?

12:37.718 --> 12:38.935
Nothing.

12:39.002 --> 12:40.553
Just getting a Hot Pocket.

12:40.638 --> 12:42.505
Oh. Love me some Fiesta Chicken, huh?

12:42.573 --> 12:44.474
The way the cheese and the chicken...?

12:44.525 --> 12:47.344
What I meant was we haven't
seen you for a while.

12:47.411 --> 12:49.245
You okay? I'm fine. Let's hook up later.

12:49.313 --> 12:50.413
We'll get facials and chat.

12:50.481 --> 12:51.981
Where are you going? We're shipping out

12:52.033 --> 12:54.317
in a few hours. Don't you need to get ready?

12:54.368 --> 12:58.388
Actually, Beckman has me
working on a mission of my own.

12:58.456 --> 13:00.457
What mission would that be exactly?

13:00.524 --> 13:01.958
Can't really talk about it. Sorry.

13:02.009 --> 13:06.162
But I hear you guys are hitting
the First Bank of Macau.

13:06.213 --> 13:08.348
Be careful.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.559
I'm here to heed your call for a roommate!

13:19.643 --> 13:21.378
I know, it's intimidating

13:21.445 --> 13:24.047
to be in the presence of a king.

13:24.115 --> 13:27.033
You'll get used to it. Oh, also,

13:27.118 --> 13:28.368
I do dishes.

13:28.452 --> 13:29.753
Is there anything else left

13:29.820 --> 13:31.371
you'd like to tell me about yourself?

13:31.455 --> 13:34.324
Well, my parents died in the plague.

13:34.392 --> 13:37.711
Okay. Um, do you have any pets?

13:37.795 --> 13:40.263
No, no pets.

13:40.331 --> 13:42.098
I'm not a big pet guy.

13:42.166 --> 13:42.932
Good to know.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.334
I like to work in leather.

13:44.402 --> 13:47.337
You are gonna go down on the top of the...

13:47.388 --> 13:49.038
You may kiss the ring.

13:49.090 --> 13:50.890
Okay.

13:52.410 --> 13:54.778
Okay.

13:54.845 --> 13:56.246
How...?

13:56.313 --> 13:59.983
Look, I think there's been
some sort of misunderstanding.

14:00.050 --> 14:03.570
I don't believe you're here for
the same ad that I put out.

14:03.654 --> 14:05.889
I don't know what the hell
ad you're talking about,

14:05.956 --> 14:07.607
but the Buy More is a delicate cover.

14:07.691 --> 14:09.592
You need to shut down this now!

14:09.660 --> 14:11.444
Casey, I have no idea what happened, okay?

14:11.529 --> 14:13.062
Look, I put out a simple ad

14:13.130 --> 14:15.331
to find a roommate, and all
these weirdoes start showing up.

14:15.399 --> 14:16.399
Chug, chug, chug...

14:16.450 --> 14:20.086
Go, go! Go, weirdo, go!

14:22.239 --> 14:23.406
Got it.

14:23.457 --> 14:25.742
Those idiots messed with my post.

14:25.810 --> 14:28.928
I'll have good luck getting
a roommate now. Perfect.

14:29.013 --> 14:32.081
Wait a minute. I got it.

14:32.149 --> 14:33.783
Casey, you have an extra room.

14:33.851 --> 14:35.218
No, not even worth saying.

14:35.286 --> 14:37.587
Yeah, but think about the possi...
Think about the...

14:45.646 --> 14:47.797
Okay, Vivian, remember,
this place is highly dangerous.

14:47.865 --> 14:50.667
You need to act like-- well, your father.

14:50.734 --> 14:52.469
Chuck will pose as your bodyguard.

14:52.536 --> 14:54.337
I'll be like your very own Kevin Costner.

14:54.405 --> 14:55.939
You'll present your account card

14:56.006 --> 14:57.507
to the bank manager, Guillermo Chan.

14:57.575 --> 14:59.442
He will lead you both up to the vaults.

14:59.493 --> 15:00.810
Remember, the vault is highly restricted.

15:00.878 --> 15:03.913
Once we're in the vault,
you're gonna have to pass

15:03.964 --> 15:05.281
a pretty rigid verification process.

15:05.332 --> 15:07.283
I'm not good with tests.

15:07.351 --> 15:08.951
What happens if I don't pass it?

15:09.003 --> 15:10.587
Just, you know... pass.

15:10.654 --> 15:12.088
You'll be fine.

15:12.139 --> 15:14.491
If you're ever at a loss, just look to me

15:14.558 --> 15:15.642
and I'll be right there.

15:15.726 --> 15:17.927
Stay close.

15:26.487 --> 15:28.137
Can I help you?

15:28.189 --> 15:30.406
I'm sorry, we aren't
accepting any new accounts.

15:30.474 --> 15:32.942
Miss Volkoff is already an account holder.

15:34.111 --> 15:35.645
Miss Volkoff?

15:37.248 --> 15:38.581
I wasn't aware

15:38.649 --> 15:40.116
this account had changed hands.

15:44.154 --> 15:45.288
Please come with me.

15:51.629 --> 15:54.180
Account holders only.

15:54.265 --> 15:56.566
I am her Kevin Cost... bodyguard!

15:56.634 --> 15:58.268
I am her bodyguard!

15:58.335 --> 15:59.552
It's okay.

16:02.806 --> 16:05.174
We'll find another way
to freeze the account.

16:05.226 --> 16:06.676
I'm getting you out of here.

16:06.727 --> 16:08.978
Chuck, you said this might be my only way

16:09.029 --> 16:10.346
to learn about my dad.

16:10.397 --> 16:12.115
Yeah. Then I'm doing it.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.504
from following Vivian. Security stopped me

16:33.589 --> 16:35.056
Okay, which way did they take her?

16:35.123 --> 16:37.191
Main staircase.

16:37.259 --> 16:40.127
Okay, there are emergency
stairs across the lobby,

16:40.195 --> 16:41.729
east wall. That should take you

16:41.797 --> 16:43.097
up to the vault level.

16:44.399 --> 16:46.133
I'm gonna need a key card.

16:48.337 --> 16:50.071
Time to be a spy.

16:51.239 --> 16:52.173
Hey, big fella.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.808
Sorry about that earlier.

16:54.860 --> 16:55.876
Little security faux-pas.

16:55.944 --> 16:57.862
the biz. I know because we're both in

16:57.946 --> 16:59.063
You know, the "security biz."

17:00.532 --> 17:03.250
My real concern is just
for Miss Volkoff's safety.

17:03.318 --> 17:05.752
I mean, how do we know she's
gonna be properly protected

17:05.820 --> 17:07.204
up there in that vault? She's safe.

17:07.289 --> 17:10.358
So you say. And I want to
believe you, I really do.

17:10.425 --> 17:12.593
But what if someone were to break in?

17:12.661 --> 17:15.546
Perhaps, oh, I don't know, a Kung Fu master?

17:15.631 --> 17:16.597
A little of this

17:16.665 --> 17:18.499
or one of these?

17:18.567 --> 17:20.184
How about swooping it and pushing it?

17:21.269 --> 17:22.369
Okay!

17:22.436 --> 17:23.671
I believe ya!

17:23.739 --> 17:27.191
I get it... Point taken. Point taken.

17:27.275 --> 17:28.842
Chuck, what are you doing?

17:28.894 --> 17:29.877
I'm a believer.

17:33.315 --> 17:35.866
Sarah, I'm in.

17:35.951 --> 17:37.401
Oh, good. Okay.

17:37.486 --> 17:39.987
Where are we?

17:40.055 --> 17:42.690
The vault level, Miss Volkoff.

17:42.741 --> 17:44.692
Follow me.

17:54.002 --> 17:55.002
What's going on?

17:55.070 --> 17:58.539
Standard security procedure.

17:58.607 --> 18:01.442
Place your hand there, on the table.

18:02.561 --> 18:03.611
Ow!

18:03.612 --> 18:05.964
Sorry. Please step back.

18:07.666 --> 18:09.084
We needed a DNA sample

18:09.135 --> 18:11.636
to make sure you are who you say you are.

18:11.720 --> 18:12.854
There should be no problem

18:12.922 --> 18:14.956
as long as you're telling us the truth

18:15.024 --> 18:17.158
and no one has removed you
from your father's account.

18:33.109 --> 18:35.009
Sarah, I'm on the vault level.

18:35.077 --> 18:36.177
No sign of Vivian.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.645
Copy.

18:37.713 --> 18:40.365
There should be a junction
in the hallway to your east.

18:40.449 --> 18:42.534
Copy. Moving east.

18:42.618 --> 18:44.552
Oh, no!

18:44.620 --> 18:45.653
What? Stepping back. What?

18:45.704 --> 18:46.671
No, no, no, no,

18:46.755 --> 18:48.189
it's not you. You're fine.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.592
I just a text from your sister.
She wants to go cake-tasting.

18:50.659 --> 18:52.393
Cake-tasting. How awful.

18:52.461 --> 18:56.548
Okay, you should see two
doors up ahead of you.

18:56.632 --> 19:00.735
Yep. Heading toward them now,
but don't change the subject.

19:00.803 --> 19:05.306
Look, I know that this
wedding stuff is supposed

19:05.357 --> 19:09.310
to be really fun, but I-I just find it

19:10.779 --> 19:14.232
you know, the cake and the flowers,
the venue and...

19:14.316 --> 19:16.701
Well, maybe it would be a
little less overwhelming

19:16.785 --> 19:18.820
if you would, you know, just pick one thing

19:18.871 --> 19:20.955
to get excited about; ease your way in.

19:42.511 --> 19:43.978
Sarah, hey, I just flashed.

19:44.046 --> 19:45.613
They have servers down here,

19:45.681 --> 19:47.115
a year ago. stolen from the Chinese Army

19:47.183 --> 19:48.683
What do you think they're using them for?

19:48.751 --> 19:49.884
I have no idea.

19:49.952 --> 19:51.986
But a bank wouldn't use military-grade tech

19:52.054 --> 19:53.988
unless they were up to something serious...

20:02.298 --> 20:04.966
Please state your name. COMPUTER VOICE:

20:05.034 --> 20:07.869
Vivian McArthur Volkoff.

20:09.538 --> 20:11.673
you like to transact? What business would

20:11.740 --> 20:14.959
I would like to access my father's account.

20:16.679 --> 20:20.114
a law enforcement agency?
Are you working with

20:25.387 --> 20:27.088
No.

20:35.864 --> 20:38.466
Vivian Volkoff...

20:38.534 --> 20:40.101
You...

20:40.169 --> 20:41.970
have...

20:42.037 --> 20:43.938
passed our test.

20:44.006 --> 20:46.107
The account is yours.

20:46.175 --> 20:47.875
Sorry for all of our extreme measures.

20:47.943 --> 20:51.412
You'll find subsequent visits to
be significantly less invasive.

20:51.463 --> 20:52.747
Here.

20:52.798 --> 20:56.050
Your father's safe-deposit box.

20:56.118 --> 20:58.620
This was all he kept at this bank?

20:59.722 --> 21:01.656
Your father once told me this contained

21:01.724 --> 21:02.890
his most prized possessions.

21:22.144 --> 21:24.245
What are you doing down here?

21:24.313 --> 21:28.349
You guys sure hide the ATMs
around here, don't you?

21:28.417 --> 21:29.500
Chuck, is everything okay?

21:29.585 --> 21:30.818
Nothing I can't handle.

21:30.886 --> 21:32.320
Okay, I spoke too soon!

21:32.371 --> 21:35.056
I can't handle it! I need help!

21:35.124 --> 21:36.291
I'm on my way.

21:46.302 --> 21:47.735
I'm afraid there's been a small problem.

21:47.803 --> 21:50.672
Your bodyguard was found in a secure area.

21:50.739 --> 21:55.677
I am... so sorry, Miss Volkoff.

22:03.218 --> 22:05.153
Were you trying to steal?

22:10.025 --> 22:11.909
I trusted you.

22:11.994 --> 22:13.461
This is what you do to me?

22:13.529 --> 22:15.029
To my reputation?

22:15.097 --> 22:16.247
Please, Miss Volkoff.

22:16.332 --> 22:17.765
This isn't necessary.

22:17.833 --> 22:18.933
This isn't your concern.

22:19.001 --> 22:21.069
You haven't been lied to like I have.

22:22.705 --> 22:24.238
What I mean is...

22:24.306 --> 22:27.742
there is no need to do
this on bank property. Yes?

22:40.823 --> 22:42.657
I'll take it from here.

22:42.724 --> 22:44.125
Thank you.

22:44.193 --> 22:47.562
You can hand him over
to my head of security.

22:53.502 --> 22:56.504
Vivian's getting pretty
good at this, isn't she?

22:56.571 --> 22:58.506
Miss Volkoff.

22:58.573 --> 23:01.976
I'll admit I didn't see the
family resemblance at first.

23:02.044 --> 23:04.579
But now...

23:04.646 --> 23:07.081
I see your father in you.

23:14.006 --> 23:16.874
a clue to where your
father hid his funds? No.

23:16.941 --> 23:19.193
I mean, these are just... pictures.

23:19.277 --> 23:20.711
Of me.

23:20.779 --> 23:22.780
So. Nothing on Volkoff's money.

23:22.847 --> 23:24.348
Looks like we hit a dead end.

23:24.416 --> 23:25.883
Unless Langley uncovers something about

23:25.950 --> 23:27.117
those servers that you saw.

23:31.456 --> 23:32.690
Excuse me.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.577
It's crazy.

23:36.661 --> 23:38.629
I mean... I barely ever knew my father,

23:38.697 --> 23:40.080
and now I discover that he's been

23:40.165 --> 23:41.548
watching me this whole time.

23:41.633 --> 23:43.367
I feel like I deserve some answers.

23:43.435 --> 23:44.702
You do.

23:44.769 --> 23:46.470
At least you got to talk to your father.

23:46.538 --> 23:48.238
I'm never going to be able to do that.

23:50.208 --> 23:52.142
Maybe you will. What do you mean?

23:52.210 --> 23:53.911
I thought the CIA had
him locked up somewhere.

23:53.978 --> 23:56.380
Yeah. But I am the CIA.

23:56.448 --> 23:58.849
I can ask around,
see if we can set up a meeting.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.284
Are you serious?

24:00.351 --> 24:02.953
Yeah. Look, I know what
you're going through. I, I do.

24:03.021 --> 24:05.022
And if you really want
to talk to your father,

24:05.090 --> 24:06.389
I can do everything that I--

24:08.777 --> 24:11.061
Thank you.

24:11.129 --> 24:13.163
You're welcome.

24:13.231 --> 24:16.900
Hey. So what's the "wedding epiphany"?

24:16.951 --> 24:18.585
I just realized we have been going about

24:18.670 --> 24:19.953
this wedding planning all wrong.

24:20.038 --> 24:21.772
We have?

24:21.840 --> 24:23.240
Yes! You don't build a wedding

24:23.291 --> 24:25.008
around flowers or the cake or the food.

24:25.076 --> 24:26.927
What do you build the wedding around?

24:26.995 --> 24:28.545
Um...

24:28.596 --> 24:30.013
The weather?

24:30.081 --> 24:31.632
The dress, Sarah.

24:31.716 --> 24:34.451
You build the wedding around thedress.

24:34.519 --> 24:36.386
a typical wedding-dress girl,
And I know you're not, like,

24:36.454 --> 24:38.756
but I just thought that...
It seems like it could be fun.

24:38.823 --> 24:40.290
Really?

24:40.358 --> 24:42.926
Yeah. Yeah, I've been looking
for a way to ease into this,

24:42.977 --> 24:44.945
and I think this might be it.

24:45.029 --> 24:47.264
In fact, I'm going to go
do some research right now.

24:47.332 --> 24:49.166
Okay.

24:58.243 --> 25:00.844
Oh, God.

25:02.614 --> 25:04.548
No.

25:09.087 --> 25:12.356
Maybe.

26:10.748 --> 26:13.317
Oh, my God.

26:13.384 --> 26:15.552
It's perfect.

26:26.397 --> 26:29.333
We're getting married.

26:30.501 --> 26:33.203
Oh my God.

26:33.271 --> 26:34.872
We're getting married?

26:38.977 --> 26:42.012
Pretty dress.

26:42.063 --> 26:43.080
I know.

26:46.751 --> 26:48.752
Uh... might want to get a new one, though.

26:48.820 --> 26:50.754
Looks like this one's been on a mission.

26:54.025 --> 26:55.826
Oh.

26:59.664 --> 27:01.915
Hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.935
I know what you two did to my ad.

27:05.003 --> 27:06.570
And guess what?

27:06.638 --> 27:07.604
You owe me.

27:07.672 --> 27:09.606
We owe you?

27:09.674 --> 27:11.258
You owe us.

27:11.342 --> 27:12.960
You would be nothing

27:13.044 --> 27:14.878
without us. You get that? Look.

27:14.946 --> 27:17.014
Look, I just need a place
to stay for tonight.

27:17.081 --> 27:18.548
And you said you had the room.

27:18.616 --> 27:20.117
Sorry, friend-o.

27:20.184 --> 27:21.551
Vacancy's been filled.

27:21.619 --> 27:23.220
Really?

27:23.288 --> 27:26.756
Come! Let us adjourn to our castle!

27:28.059 --> 27:31.561
Can you believe we get to live with a king?

27:31.629 --> 27:35.599
This is going to score
us some serious Ren-tang.

27:45.710 --> 27:47.311
from Langley. We've just heard back -

27:47.378 --> 27:48.912
Using the stolen servers,

27:48.980 --> 27:50.948
turning itself into the bank is basically

27:51.015 --> 27:52.616
a black market stock exchange,

27:52.684 --> 27:56.186
terrorists, and rogue nations.
laundering money for criminals,

27:56.254 --> 27:57.721
So if we could access those servers,

27:57.789 --> 27:59.256
that intelligence would be priceless.

27:59.324 --> 28:00.824
Exactly, Agent Walker.

28:00.892 --> 28:02.693
need Miss Volkoff. Which is why we still

28:02.760 --> 28:04.328
As an account holder,

28:04.395 --> 28:05.996
and manually upload she can enter the bank,

28:06.064 --> 28:07.531
a digital tag to their network.

28:07.598 --> 28:08.932
Bartowski--

28:09.000 --> 28:11.101
the asset to do that?
do you think you can get

28:11.169 --> 28:14.271
Uh, yes, yes, I think I can,

28:14.339 --> 28:16.907
but we might have to give
her something in return.

28:16.975 --> 28:20.243
She would like a meeting with her father.

28:20.311 --> 28:22.245
A meeting?

28:22.313 --> 28:23.814
With Alexei Volkoff?

28:23.881 --> 28:25.849
After all she's been through,

28:25.917 --> 28:28.018
don't you think we owe her that much?

28:29.454 --> 28:30.820
Fine.

28:30.872 --> 28:32.122
I'll set it up.

28:32.190 --> 28:33.190
Thank you, General.

28:33.257 --> 28:35.325
Oh, and there is one more thing.

28:35.376 --> 28:36.593
In order to keep the bank

28:36.661 --> 28:38.362
from realizing what Miss Volkoff is doing,

28:38.429 --> 28:39.363
we'll need a diversion.

28:39.430 --> 28:40.897
What did you have in mind?

28:40.965 --> 28:43.900
Gear up. You two are going to rob a bank.

28:55.652 --> 28:58.287
So it comes down to this.

29:14.104 --> 29:16.305
Buy More?

29:16.356 --> 29:18.023
Why would there be a
facility at the Buy More?

29:18.108 --> 29:20.943
MAN 2: They've got facilities
like you wouldn't believe.

29:20.994 --> 29:23.495
I've seen everything,
and nothing surprises me.

29:27.117 --> 29:30.369
MAN 1: The only other TR476 I'd
installed before was in Langley.

29:30.453 --> 29:31.820
So why here in Burbank?

29:31.888 --> 29:34.690
If it's above my clearance,
I don't ask questions.

29:34.758 --> 29:35.824
Neither should you, Todd.

29:35.892 --> 29:36.925
Just making conversation.

29:36.993 --> 29:37.926
Don't.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.168
No, it's just, uh,

30:19.219 --> 30:22.137
maintenance, I believe,
over here in Sector 7G.

30:22.205 --> 30:24.139
Sir.

30:32.399 --> 30:33.899
Hi.

30:33.983 --> 30:35.317
Casey.

30:35.385 --> 30:36.719
What are you doing here, Grimes?

30:36.786 --> 30:38.771
Nothing. Nothing. I was, uh...

30:38.855 --> 30:41.607
I needed a place to stay, as you know.

30:41.691 --> 30:44.593
Uh, so I thought I could
just crash here for tonight.

30:44.661 --> 30:46.261
What did you see?

30:46.329 --> 30:48.163
Are you k... I don't
have very good eyesight.

30:48.231 --> 30:50.366
You know? I thought they
were installing some...

30:50.433 --> 30:51.633
maybe DirecTV or something.

30:51.701 --> 30:52.785
Or 'cause they were... You know.

30:52.869 --> 30:53.786
There was some... Nothing.

30:53.870 --> 30:55.087
Hey, but I should go.

30:55.171 --> 30:56.405
I'll-I'll go sleep under
my desk at the Buy More.

30:56.456 --> 30:57.906
You know, it's probably more comfortable.

30:57.974 --> 30:59.108
If you could just kind of point
me in the right direction,

30:59.175 --> 31:00.275
though, 'cause again, I don't, uh...

31:00.343 --> 31:01.510
John! Yeah, okay, you're still there.

31:01.577 --> 31:03.512
Okay, whoo. Okay.

31:08.084 --> 31:10.819
We are delighted to see
you again, Miss Volkoff.

31:10.887 --> 31:13.021
Thank you so much.

31:13.089 --> 31:14.440
I'm glad you were able to accommodate me

31:14.524 --> 31:15.441
at such a late hour.

31:15.525 --> 31:16.475
Our clientele

31:16.559 --> 31:18.026
demands constant access.

31:18.094 --> 31:19.194
Okay, she's in.

31:19.262 --> 31:21.196
You ready to do this?

31:23.433 --> 31:26.502
What are you doing? What?

31:26.569 --> 31:28.337
We're robbing a bank, right?
You packed them, so I thought...

31:28.405 --> 31:30.605
Yeah, I packed them in case we
had the chance to go out later.

31:30.657 --> 31:31.940
Take them off. You'll wreck them.

31:32.008 --> 31:34.042
Sorry.

31:34.110 --> 31:35.144
That's better.

31:40.250 --> 31:41.183
Now...

31:41.251 --> 31:43.852
Let's go rob a bank.

31:49.225 --> 31:51.727
Take as much time as you need.

31:54.764 --> 31:56.765
Just let him know when you want to leave.

32:31.384 --> 32:33.635
Ma'am, wait here, please.

33:15.712 --> 33:16.745
Drop it now!

33:16.813 --> 33:17.980
This is a robbery!

33:18.047 --> 33:19.648
Everybody stay down!

33:32.779 --> 33:36.265
Miss Volkoff, may I come in?

33:38.067 --> 33:40.786
The CIA is not on your side, you know.

33:40.854 --> 33:45.107
You're simply an asset to them;
they've been using you.

33:45.174 --> 33:46.258
No, it's not true.

33:46.342 --> 33:49.211
Did one of them seem to understand you,

33:49.279 --> 33:51.413
you know, what you're going through?

33:51.481 --> 33:53.515
And did he use that connection

33:53.583 --> 33:56.084
to get you to help him?

33:56.152 --> 33:59.922
And was it this one?

34:04.060 --> 34:05.777
Yeah, this is Charles Carmichael.

34:05.862 --> 34:08.463
He's the agent responsible for
putting your father in jail.

34:10.400 --> 34:15.404
Keep filling those bags,
people! Let's go, let's go, let's go!

34:15.455 --> 34:16.371
Having fun?

34:16.438 --> 34:17.739
A little. Kinda takes you

34:17.790 --> 34:19.641
mind off the whole wedding thing,
doesn't it?

34:19.708 --> 34:21.109
Actually, it hasn't been so bad.

34:21.177 --> 34:23.277
You know, I took you up on your advice,
and I found a dress.

34:23.329 --> 34:25.112
Hey! Ellie was right. When I put it on,

34:25.181 --> 34:26.614
it felt like magic.

34:26.666 --> 34:28.283
Get down on the ground

34:28.333 --> 34:29.751
before I blow your freakin' head off!

34:29.802 --> 34:31.136
I'm so glad you found a dress.

34:31.219 --> 34:33.422
That's awesome. And I bet
you look gorgeous in it.

34:33.473 --> 34:35.924
Don't be a hero, my friend!
I will break your face!

34:35.992 --> 34:37.259
Well, it's actually really pretty.

34:37.310 --> 34:38.927
And you know, I never
thought I would say this,

34:38.995 --> 34:41.429
but I felt like a princess.

34:42.931 --> 34:45.766
Mr. Riley, my father is a criminal.

34:45.835 --> 34:47.235
That's what they call him.

34:47.303 --> 34:52.991
You saw what your father left
for you here at the bank.

34:53.076 --> 34:56.478
He loves you, you know?

34:56.545 --> 34:58.847
The CIA has used you.

34:58.915 --> 35:01.183
You know that, right?

35:01.250 --> 35:04.353
Chuck promised me that I
would get to meet my father.

35:04.420 --> 35:05.537
No...

35:05.622 --> 35:08.690
you're not gonna get to see your father

35:08.758 --> 35:10.826
because they don't want you to.

35:10.893 --> 35:12.494
And there's only one way

35:12.562 --> 35:16.298
that you can truly learn about your father.

35:16.366 --> 35:19.901
When you're ready...

35:19.969 --> 35:21.336
you let me know.

35:27.977 --> 35:29.544
Oh...

35:31.114 --> 35:35.183
You left this in your father's office.

35:37.820 --> 35:40.021
Thought you might like to have it.

35:53.069 --> 35:54.252
Get down here!

35:55.972 --> 35:58.674
Come on, come on!
It's about that time, honey bunny.

35:58.725 --> 35:59.841
Nobody follow! We have a hostage!

35:59.892 --> 36:00.892
Keep walking.

36:00.977 --> 36:03.812
No one shoot! She's a Volkoff!

36:05.231 --> 36:07.215
Thank you, Bank of Macau.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.751
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.673
Mission accomplished.

36:37.180 --> 36:39.181
Hey, you did great in there.

36:39.248 --> 36:40.615
Thanks.

36:42.518 --> 36:44.619
Everything all right?

36:44.687 --> 36:46.254
Yeah.

36:46.322 --> 36:47.522
Everything's fine.

36:49.179 --> 36:51.075
Ok.

37:01.035 --> 37:02.502
in the First Bank
of Macau's servers

37:02.570 --> 37:04.804
and made the break-in look
like a legitimate robbery.

37:04.872 --> 37:06.740
The digital tag is already leading us

37:06.807 --> 37:08.542
to terrorist organizations

37:08.609 --> 37:10.877
all around the globe. Good work, team.

37:11.595 --> 37:13.346
Uh, General, sorry.

37:13.413 --> 37:15.231
About the deal that we made with Vivian.

37:15.299 --> 37:16.832
When does she get to see Volkoff?

37:16.900 --> 37:18.801
Ah, yes.

37:18.869 --> 37:20.369
After some consideration,

37:20.437 --> 37:22.972
we have decided the security
risks are too great.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.941
I'm sorry. No, no! No!

37:25.008 --> 37:27.944
Uh, I promised her that she'd
be able to see her father.

37:28.011 --> 37:29.879
What am I supposed to tell her now?

37:29.947 --> 37:31.514
Agent Bartowski,

37:31.582 --> 37:33.983
you told your asset what she needed to hear.

37:34.034 --> 37:35.501
That's what a spy does.

37:35.586 --> 37:36.586
Well done.

37:38.689 --> 37:42.008
Do you need my help telling her?

37:43.126 --> 37:45.061
No.

37:45.128 --> 37:47.046
Thanks, though.

37:47.130 --> 37:48.631
She trusted me.

37:48.682 --> 37:50.633
I'll do it.

37:54.304 --> 37:56.239
Vivian, I'm sorry,

37:56.306 --> 37:59.041
but they're not going to
let you see your father.

37:59.109 --> 38:01.043
What?

38:01.111 --> 38:03.312
What do you mean?

38:03.363 --> 38:05.314
They went back on their word.

38:05.382 --> 38:07.316
They? The CIA?

38:07.384 --> 38:09.385
But I thought youwere the CIA.

38:09.453 --> 38:10.720
I am.

38:10.787 --> 38:13.239
It-It's just... It's...

38:13.323 --> 38:15.591
It's complicated.

38:15.659 --> 38:17.360
I'm-I'm... I'm not giving up.

38:17.427 --> 38:20.196
I promise, I will find a
way for you to see him.

38:20.264 --> 38:22.331
It just might take a
little while, that's all.

38:22.399 --> 38:25.201
Look, I know this is a
lot to handle right now.

38:25.269 --> 38:26.402
Are you okay?

38:27.504 --> 38:29.438
I'm fine.

38:30.574 --> 38:32.508
Thank you for being honest with me.

38:36.747 --> 38:40.182
<i> Okay, you told me that I had to
choose between the roses</i>

38:40.233 --> 38:41.984
and the orchids, but that was before

38:42.052 --> 38:43.552
you showed me the Casablanca Lilies!

38:43.604 --> 38:44.770
I need a hundred dozen.

38:44.855 --> 38:45.988
A hundred dozen? More?

38:46.056 --> 38:48.324
I'm sorry. So what did
you think about the cake?

38:48.391 --> 38:50.893
Did you like the hazelnut cream,
or...? I really liked it.

38:50.944 --> 38:52.995
It reminded me of this
amazing patisserie in Paris,

38:53.063 --> 38:55.498
and I think that maybe we
should fly the cake in.

38:55.565 --> 38:57.450
In fact, definitely we
should fly the cake in.

38:57.534 --> 38:58.784
Oh, that sounds really expensive,

38:58.869 --> 39:00.469
especially after that
dress that you picked out.

39:00.537 --> 39:01.971
Well, you only get married once, right?

39:02.039 --> 39:03.706
And this is meant to be really special,

39:03.757 --> 39:05.240
and plus, it'll make Chuck really happy.

39:05.292 --> 39:07.109
I should look into booking a private island

39:07.177 --> 39:08.778
for the ceremony.

39:08.845 --> 39:10.379
Yes.

39:10.430 --> 39:12.381
Oh, my God.

39:14.635 --> 39:16.052
Oh.

39:16.119 --> 39:17.303
Ellie.

39:17.387 --> 39:19.889
What the heck was that?

39:19.956 --> 39:22.391
I think I created a monster.

39:22.442 --> 39:24.143
Yeah. Well...

39:24.227 --> 39:26.996
'Cause I work... I work...
I work at the Buy More,

39:27.064 --> 39:29.465
and that stuff sounds kind of pricey.

39:29.533 --> 39:33.202
Maybe you could just pick
up a few extra shifts.

39:34.788 --> 39:36.405
Or rob a bank.

39:36.456 --> 39:38.474
Ha. You...

39:41.244 --> 39:43.245
Oh, what's going on there, Case Logic?

39:43.296 --> 39:44.246
Huh?

39:44.314 --> 39:45.447
Case Logic?

39:45.499 --> 39:47.583
Mid-nineties, held your CDs?

39:47.634 --> 39:49.685
All right, you're clearly
not a nickname guy.

39:49.753 --> 39:50.920
Oh, God.

39:50.971 --> 39:52.922
And well, look, I just wanted to apologize

39:52.989 --> 39:54.840
about, uh, you know, snooping around, man.

39:54.925 --> 39:58.460
I just... I want you to know I
just needed a place to sleep.

39:58.512 --> 40:00.479
But, uh, between you and I, what was

40:00.564 --> 40:02.732
exactly going down there in Castle?
I mean... Nothing.

40:04.267 --> 40:06.402
Not very nice.

40:06.469 --> 40:08.371
Well...

40:08.438 --> 40:10.606
Ugh. then that wasn't, uh,

40:10.674 --> 40:14.143
some weird, mysterious door
that I saw you walking out of?

40:15.862 --> 40:17.146
Look, you're right.

40:17.197 --> 40:19.498
I have no idea what I'm even talking about.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.350
There's obviously some rational reason

40:21.418 --> 40:23.386
you would have a TR-476

40:23.453 --> 40:24.870
in some weird, strange room.

40:24.955 --> 40:26.288
And I'm just overtired.

40:26.356 --> 40:27.873
I haven't slept, I haven't eaten.

40:27.958 --> 40:29.709
And I just really want a place to stay.

40:29.793 --> 40:31.010
Grimes? Yeah.

40:31.094 --> 40:32.995
Are you leveraging me
to stay in my apartment?

40:33.046 --> 40:34.330
I don't, uh...

40:34.398 --> 40:36.498
Am I?

40:37.634 --> 40:39.602
Let's say I was.

40:39.669 --> 40:41.721
Is it working?

40:41.805 --> 40:43.973
Okay.

40:44.024 --> 40:46.375
You can stay at my place
as long as you keep quiet,

40:46.443 --> 40:49.178
don't tell anyone-- especially Bartowski.

40:49.246 --> 40:51.680
God, Casey, you have no idea
how much this means to me.

40:51.732 --> 40:52.848
Come here. Don't...

40:52.899 --> 40:54.016
Don't get too excited.

40:54.067 --> 40:55.184
Just keeping you close,

40:55.235 --> 40:56.569
make sure you keep your mouth shut.

40:56.653 --> 40:58.387
'Cause if you don't...

40:58.455 --> 41:01.157
I know where you live.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.708
Right. 'Cause I'll...

41:05.712 --> 41:07.546
Scram. Thank you, sir.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.498
Thank you.

41:35.091 --> 41:39.028
Vivian, it's, uh... it's Chuck and, um...

41:39.095 --> 41:42.264
Look, I know that you must be feeling...

41:45.902 --> 41:48.504
Just give me a call when
you get a chance, uh...

41:48.572 --> 41:49.939
if you could, that'd be great.

41:50.006 --> 41:50.973
Thanks. Bye.

42:06.056 --> 42:07.756
I'm ready to learn the
truth about my father.
