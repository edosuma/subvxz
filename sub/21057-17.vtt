00:36.509 --> 00:40.350
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:42.310 --> 00:45.119
I'm not going to wake up.

00:45.549 --> 00:49.390
Let's keep this as a secret between us.

00:49.689 --> 00:52.320
You should have died. Why are you still alive?

00:52.560 --> 00:55.189
Didn't you think I'd prepare for this?

00:55.530 --> 00:56.729
On behalf of my father-in-law,

00:56.729 --> 00:58.359
I'm going to sue you to retrieve our shares.

00:58.500 --> 01:02.500
I think Mr. Han got his information from this woman until now.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.500
How do you expect me to prepare one million dollars?

01:04.500 --> 01:07.739
You can use Chairman Ahn's cash or real estate property...

01:07.769 --> 01:09.239
as a collateral and take a loan out from a bank.

01:09.409 --> 01:12.909
Who do you think will inherit the money if that woman dies?

01:13.010 --> 01:16.049
Father will get it all back. We must do it if it's the only way.

01:16.310 --> 01:19.420
I'm here to end you.

01:19.620 --> 01:21.489
An attacker has entered Chairwoman Park's suite.

01:21.689 --> 01:23.560
I just received a call from Bang Soon.

01:23.560 --> 01:25.590
Apparently, Jae Gu can't be reached.

01:26.790 --> 01:28.629
I think maybe...

01:30.060 --> 01:31.829
you will end up dead.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.180
She forced me to do it.

01:45.680 --> 01:49.349
I gave Bok Ja information about Chairman Ahn.

01:51.180 --> 01:53.719
The goal was to seduce Chairman Ahn and get something for ourselves.

01:59.590 --> 02:00.659
But...

02:01.890 --> 02:03.359
she knew about you.

02:04.829 --> 02:06.900
Even before I told her about you,

02:08.500 --> 02:10.199
she knew your name.

02:22.780 --> 02:25.449
You can never make it to the upper class.

02:26.219 --> 02:28.219
Even though you have a lot of money,

02:28.490 --> 02:30.759
you're nothing more than a caregiver for the sick.

03:01.889 --> 03:04.560
- Hello? - I am looking for a caregiver.

03:06.889 --> 03:10.229
Just help him become more happy

03:10.330 --> 03:11.759
and healthy.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.530
I will pay you more for that.

03:16.199 --> 03:18.969
This is your opportunity to repent your sins.

03:19.539 --> 03:21.310
Make everything right.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.580
But ma'am.

03:28.879 --> 03:30.449
Hiring a person is a big deal.

03:31.849 --> 03:34.449
You shouldn't be hiring people so easily.

03:37.689 --> 03:39.289
There must be some qualifications.

03:41.659 --> 03:45.360
A person who likes Matisse and Kandinsky would be nice.

04:11.789 --> 04:13.430
Who does she think I am?

04:17.800 --> 04:19.230
Who does she think I am?

04:35.579 --> 04:36.610
What?

04:36.720 --> 04:38.649
Hey, come home.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.319
Which one?

04:40.649 --> 04:42.920
The one you used to live in, you punk.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.110
Hey, Jin Hee. Is Ji Hu sleeping?

05:09.050 --> 05:10.949
I'm going to drop by early tomorrow morning.

05:12.149 --> 05:13.449
Yes, and Jin Hee,

05:13.620 --> 05:16.790
do you want to come by the gallery tomorrow and have lunch with me?

05:18.220 --> 05:19.889
Okay, see you tomorrow.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.379
Partner, what are you doing?

05:41.709 --> 05:43.079
I'm reading a book of poetry.

05:44.350 --> 05:45.519
I miss you.

05:56.759 --> 05:58.000
Were you taken aback?

06:02.300 --> 06:03.370
No way.

06:16.180 --> 06:19.050
- Hello? - What's with your responses?

06:20.189 --> 06:21.350
Have you eaten?

06:22.089 --> 06:24.689
We never progress past talking about food.

06:24.790 --> 06:26.220
Don't you have anything else to say to me...

06:26.220 --> 06:27.790
besides asking me if I've eaten?

06:28.459 --> 06:32.129
I'll arrive in front of your house in 30 minutes,

06:32.300 --> 06:33.430
so come out for a moment.

06:34.029 --> 06:35.199
Why so late at night?

06:35.829 --> 06:38.500
Why else? Because I miss you.

06:38.839 --> 06:40.870
I have to see you at your office tomorrow anyway.

06:41.670 --> 06:43.110
That's tomorrow.

06:44.079 --> 06:47.910
I really need to see you today. Come out, okay? I'm hanging up!

06:57.459 --> 07:00.290
So, are you asking me for extra pay...

07:00.329 --> 07:01.560
for how much you worked?

07:01.930 --> 07:03.189
That's right.

07:03.529 --> 07:06.360
Your brother made us work and then ditched.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.470
Hey, but our brother can't be reached.

07:10.170 --> 07:11.769
We're not asking for all of it.

07:11.870 --> 07:14.410
It's not even that much. Why are you giving them a discount, you punk?

07:14.610 --> 07:16.540
Why are you asking me for that money?

07:16.779 --> 07:18.480
If Jae Gu made you work, you should get it from him!

07:18.639 --> 07:21.149
That's because I can't reach him!

07:21.310 --> 07:23.379
If I told you to pay off...

07:23.379 --> 07:25.319
your brother's debt, would you do it?

07:25.550 --> 07:27.550
That's totally absurd!

07:27.790 --> 07:28.819
In any case, I can't do it.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.490
Then we'll eat and sleep here...

07:31.620 --> 07:33.660
until Jae Gu gets back.

07:33.790 --> 07:35.329
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.

07:35.660 --> 07:37.100
Get out right now!

07:37.199 --> 07:38.230
No way.

07:39.199 --> 07:41.029
How much money are you asking for?

07:42.730 --> 07:44.540
10,000 dollars for me and 5,000 dollars for him.

07:45.069 --> 07:47.269
What are you saying? It's 7,000 dollars!

07:47.670 --> 07:49.709
Hey, you blockhead, he owes you 5,000 dollars.

07:49.709 --> 07:51.680
In that case, he owes you 8,000 dollars.

07:51.910 --> 07:53.709
Gosh, I might actually go crazy.

07:53.850 --> 07:55.180
But Jae Hui, I heard...

07:55.250 --> 07:57.420
you go crazy on the phone about a way to save the company.

07:57.519 --> 07:58.550
What was that about?

07:58.550 --> 08:00.350
Forget it. It's none of your business.

08:00.620 --> 08:03.620
Gosh. I don't know. I'm going home.

08:03.660 --> 08:05.990
Hey, give me some money first.

08:05.990 --> 08:08.189
And pay these people and make them leave.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.329
You have a company account! That's what Mr. Oh said.

08:11.930 --> 08:15.199
He said Father didn't cancel your company card or your monthly pay.

08:15.670 --> 08:17.800
I have to support my family.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.500
And I don't have money to give these punks!

08:19.500 --> 08:21.410
At least give me 10,000 dollars!

08:21.470 --> 08:23.709
Jae Hui, have you even visited Father at the hospital?

08:23.910 --> 08:27.350
Why would I go there? I would have kicked him if he wasn't my dad.

08:27.779 --> 08:30.120
The old man is unconscious.

08:30.120 --> 08:33.950
Don't think about spending money and pray that Father wakes up first.

08:33.950 --> 08:35.049
Darn it!

08:35.049 --> 08:37.419
I have to catch that wench and torture her.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.620
Where's that lady right now?

08:38.690 --> 08:41.860
Where else? She's in her Saint Palace suite room.

08:43.259 --> 08:45.000
Why is she there of all places?

08:45.360 --> 08:49.100
That's where I had my wedding anniversary.

08:49.269 --> 08:51.740
How can you say things like that in this situation?

08:52.100 --> 08:54.710
In that sense, you're a very sensitive person.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.980
I'm lonelier than I've ever been.

08:57.539 --> 09:00.779
I don't have any earthling friends to interchange feelings with.

09:00.779 --> 09:03.450
Good for you. Leave Earth and go to Mars.

09:03.450 --> 09:06.049
I'd actually be willing if there's a pretty woman there.

09:06.049 --> 09:07.149
You're crazy.

09:07.850 --> 09:10.019
But where did Jae Gu go?

09:17.960 --> 09:19.059
I am looking for a caregiver.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.929
A person who likes Matisse and Kandinsky would be nice.

09:30.909 --> 09:32.840
(New message, Woo A Jin)

09:32.940 --> 09:35.580
I'm no longer a caregiver...

09:35.580 --> 09:38.120
of your house.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.179
(New message, Mr. Ahn)

10:13.690 --> 10:15.649
Mr. Oh just went into the room.

10:21.460 --> 10:24.200
Is the company running properly without any problems?

10:24.200 --> 10:28.029
Our sales are steadily on the rise, and the factory is running well.

10:30.740 --> 10:32.370
The factory is running well?

10:33.070 --> 10:35.970
Are you saying the factory hasn't been shaken up...

10:36.840 --> 10:38.610
even though I sold the company and disappeared?

10:38.779 --> 10:41.210
Mr. Han is very sly.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.320
He's calling himself a management specialist

10:44.620 --> 10:46.279
and gaining their trust.

10:47.049 --> 10:48.720
He's already built his own camp of supporters.

10:49.590 --> 10:51.019
I don't think he started this...

10:51.019 --> 10:52.490
because he's interested in the company.

10:52.519 --> 10:55.590
That can't be true. He's managing it with a lot of enthusiasm.

10:58.259 --> 11:02.100
He's just a hunting dog with a good sense of smell for money.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.269
He already has people on his side within the company.

11:05.340 --> 11:06.370
His side?

11:06.370 --> 11:08.570
I think he's been meeting with Chairman Ahn's daughter quite often.

11:08.970 --> 11:11.509
It seems like Mr. Han has a hidden agenda.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.679
I think we should look into it further.

11:13.710 --> 11:16.980
I've never met a single person who doesn't have a hidden agenda.

11:17.750 --> 11:20.250
That must be the only way to avoid falling. No,

11:20.419 --> 11:21.720
that must be why they don't fall.

11:24.220 --> 11:27.230
A Jin got a medical note claiming Chairman Ahn has dementia.

11:29.129 --> 11:31.399
She must be trying to nullify the stock transfer.

11:31.460 --> 11:32.759
I'm aware of that already.

11:33.970 --> 11:35.629
Did you meet with A Jin?

11:35.830 --> 11:39.139
Yes, if she files the lawsuit, it will be a huge legal battle.

11:39.240 --> 11:43.139
Mr. Kim and I can prove Chairman Ahn doesn't have dementia.

11:43.240 --> 11:47.210
No, A Jin isn't that stupid.

11:48.210 --> 11:51.419
Mr. Ahn didn't go to work while he was under treatment,

11:51.419 --> 11:54.389
so your testimonies won't be very effective.

11:55.220 --> 11:56.960
It's a different story with Mr. Kim.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.700
Don't call me out at this hour from now on.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.509
I'm really busy these days.

12:14.669 --> 12:15.970
Then when should I call you out?

12:16.440 --> 12:18.080
I'll call you out instead.

12:18.509 --> 12:22.149
Really? Then I'll patiently wait.

12:23.379 --> 12:24.549
Is work going well these days?

12:24.649 --> 12:26.620
I heard your blog really took off.

12:26.889 --> 12:29.389
- Have you seen it? - Of course.

12:29.649 --> 12:30.889
You're a cool woman, A Jin.

12:31.860 --> 12:33.990
- I'll cheer you on. - Thank you.

12:35.429 --> 12:37.460
- Where are we going? - I'm not sure.

13:21.139 --> 13:24.679
I will sue for violation of portrait rights and defamation of character.

13:25.610 --> 13:28.779
Of course, you should. We want that as well.

13:29.250 --> 13:32.149
That way, our apartment's image will be firmly promoted.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.090
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

13:35.289 --> 13:38.059
If the apartment's residents publicize the news...

13:38.059 --> 13:40.590
that we're campaigning to recover our proper living space...

13:40.629 --> 13:43.629
for the sake of our apartment's high-quality image,

13:43.830 --> 13:47.370
we'd be really thankful for your efforts.

13:48.529 --> 13:51.169
If we are charged, we'll get an immediate court decision...

13:51.200 --> 13:53.269
of a 500 dollar-fine.

13:53.669 --> 13:55.639
You see, my husband is a lawyer.

13:56.470 --> 13:58.409
That's how I looked into it in such detail.

14:00.309 --> 14:03.149
Oh, gosh, your boyfriend is here to pick you up.

14:04.149 --> 14:06.019
Then we'll get going first.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.919
I wish you luck in preparing for the lawsuit.

14:20.370 --> 14:21.429
Where did A Jin go?

14:21.529 --> 14:23.840
I will never give up on this house.

14:24.570 --> 14:27.009
I've lost way too much because of you.

14:27.039 --> 14:29.210
- I asked where A Jin went. - I don't know!

14:31.539 --> 14:35.110
Gosh, those two aren't on good terms.

14:35.450 --> 14:37.850
- Oh, no. His ex is coming! - Oh, my goodness.

14:37.850 --> 14:39.320
A man is with her!

14:40.120 --> 14:41.789
Oh, no. The husband saw.

14:41.789 --> 14:43.120
You scumbag!

14:46.559 --> 14:47.629
What was that?

14:47.789 --> 14:50.960
It's shameful and vulgar, but this is a new turn.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.700
- Let's go, Gi Ho. - What? "Gi Ho"?

14:53.929 --> 14:56.000
Gosh, do you address each other by first name?

14:56.100 --> 14:58.269
- Let's go, A Jin. - Hey! You two!

14:58.370 --> 14:59.700
Let's just see each other in court.

14:59.700 --> 15:00.769
There's no need.

15:00.769 --> 15:03.480
I'm going to give that house to my wife!

15:05.740 --> 15:07.879
I said I'm going to give that house to my wife!

15:08.049 --> 15:11.049
I had her sign a name trust agreement before.

15:11.419 --> 15:14.090
- What are you saying? - That house is to be occupied...

15:14.090 --> 15:16.019
by me, Woo A Jin, and Ahn Ji Hu.

15:16.019 --> 15:19.860
And I will confidently change the ownership to Woo A Jin.

15:20.659 --> 15:24.129
Let's sue him. Are you crazy? Why would I live with you?

15:24.429 --> 15:27.570
A Jin, you've become really rough after seeing this guy.

15:27.870 --> 15:31.539
If you say one more thing, I'll hit you.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.600
A Jin.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.049
A Jin, how could you...

15:48.049 --> 15:49.289
- Mom. - Yes?

15:49.590 --> 15:50.919
I want to see Dad.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.059
Okay, then. You can see him after school.

15:54.259 --> 15:55.629
- Really? - Yes.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.870
Eat a lot, my love.

16:32.929 --> 16:34.399
Aren't you going to Pung Suk's Kitchen?

16:34.629 --> 16:37.600
Chairman Ahn isn't home, and the house is empty,

16:38.139 --> 16:39.639
so it's been a long time...

16:41.610 --> 16:43.980
I really liked food from Pung Suk's Kitchen.

16:44.580 --> 16:46.379
Especially the chonggak kimchi.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.610
It was delicious, wasn't it?

16:47.649 --> 16:50.320
I want to eat it. Pick some up today.

16:50.580 --> 16:51.679
Sure, ma'am.

16:53.950 --> 16:55.919
Why aren't you on that woman's side?

17:00.629 --> 17:04.059
It's really hard to know what you're thinking, Ms. Jo.

17:20.848 --> 17:21.880
Welcome.

17:23.309 --> 17:24.549
Aren't you making kimchi?

17:24.549 --> 17:26.250
We're not making kimchi today,

17:26.250 --> 17:27.750
but we just finished the marinated crab.

17:29.319 --> 17:30.819
I guess they're starting to come.

17:35.359 --> 17:36.700
Who are you?

17:41.029 --> 17:43.299
We're from Seoul's national tax service, bureau of investigation.

17:44.170 --> 17:45.900
A citizen made a report,

17:46.470 --> 17:48.740
saying you illegally produce, distribute,

17:48.740 --> 17:50.309
and sell products and evade taxes.

18:01.049 --> 18:02.089
My goodness.

18:04.190 --> 18:05.190
Hello?

18:05.690 --> 18:07.759
Oh, my, Mr. Park.

18:08.089 --> 18:09.130
Yes.

18:09.559 --> 18:11.430
You did a good job.

18:11.559 --> 18:14.099
I'll buy you a drink some time.

18:14.869 --> 18:16.900
Okay, talk to you later.

18:18.269 --> 18:19.299
Take this away.

18:20.670 --> 18:21.869
Gosh, darn it.

18:22.009 --> 18:26.009
Who does she think I am? Does she want to die?

18:26.980 --> 18:29.980
She needs to lose everything to come to her senses.

18:30.180 --> 18:31.319
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:33.279 --> 18:37.160
By the way, about that branch manager, Mr. Park.

18:37.720 --> 18:39.960
I couldn't find him when I searched him online.

18:40.690 --> 18:42.230
Oh, he's in the black market.

18:42.660 --> 18:45.930
It's not a bank that gives out ordinary loans,

18:46.130 --> 18:47.730
so he can become a target if exposes himself.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.200
The black market is what moves our economy.

18:51.539 --> 18:53.240
Oh, I see.

18:54.170 --> 18:56.980
Your bank loan will be approved at 3pm this afternoon,

18:57.380 --> 18:58.609
and it'll be deposited right away.

18:58.910 --> 18:59.980
Great.

19:01.309 --> 19:04.880
But the power of attorney that I forged...

19:05.079 --> 19:07.750
is a secret between the two of us, okay?

19:08.119 --> 19:09.250
Don't worry.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.319
Even if Chairman Ahn was awake,

19:11.319 --> 19:12.990
he would have made the same decision anyway.

19:14.329 --> 19:17.200
But did you get the consent of your siblings?

19:17.460 --> 19:18.460
No.

19:18.960 --> 19:22.269
I haven't been able to contact Jae Gu for a few days now,

19:22.569 --> 19:24.869
and Jae Seok is worried about his own affairs,

19:24.869 --> 19:26.670
so he's not interested in the company.

19:29.109 --> 19:30.839
But what should I do about Park Bok Ja?

19:31.539 --> 19:33.109
I have to get that money back.

19:33.450 --> 19:36.680
When Park Bok Ja kicked you out of the house,

19:36.849 --> 19:38.250
you shouldn't have left.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.420
You should have guarded your father until the end.

19:43.619 --> 19:45.960
But you know about our family matters so well.

19:46.559 --> 19:48.730
I'm very interested in you, Jae Hui.

19:49.089 --> 19:50.559
I probably know everything about you.

19:52.299 --> 19:53.930
I heard you mix cola with your rice.

19:55.329 --> 19:57.299
Did Park Bok Ja Park tell you about that too?

20:01.970 --> 20:04.809
Please explain it to the chairman well, ma'am.

20:05.109 --> 20:08.680
At this rate, it'll be hard for us to stay in business here.

20:10.019 --> 20:13.019
They took the computer hard drive containing our list of clients.

20:13.619 --> 20:17.460
One works for tax services, and the other is a newspaper reporter.

20:18.559 --> 20:20.660
Yes, ma'am. Please do that.

20:21.930 --> 20:26.299
Kimchi? We're all out so we have to make a fresh batch,

20:26.430 --> 20:28.200
but we are unable to operate at the moment.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.009
Do we have any more kimchi?

20:42.910 --> 20:44.880
Sir, the thing is...

20:45.750 --> 20:48.650
Pung Suk's Kitchen is being investigated.

20:49.049 --> 20:50.990
It sounds like someone targeted them.

20:52.059 --> 20:54.789
They said they might have to close down the business.

20:55.589 --> 20:58.099
They can't do that! They can't!

20:58.359 --> 20:59.960
I need my kimchi!

21:04.700 --> 21:06.400
Neither one wants to settle.

21:06.470 --> 21:09.009
Please convince both parties to come to an agreement.

21:09.170 --> 21:12.039
If they do, your husband will only have to pay a fine,

21:12.380 --> 21:14.210
and that hospital director must sign an agreement...

21:14.210 --> 21:16.250
for the charge to be dropped.

21:16.380 --> 21:19.220
I understand. I'll talk to both of them.

21:19.619 --> 21:20.619
Okay.

21:26.359 --> 21:28.160
Whose side is that woman on?

21:28.630 --> 21:30.700
They need to make adultery illegal again.

21:33.670 --> 21:35.170
Hello, this is Division 2.

21:36.529 --> 21:39.539
Pardon? They won't proceed with it?

21:41.039 --> 21:42.970
Okay, I understand.

21:49.279 --> 21:51.450
(Notice)

22:23.279 --> 22:24.480
Have you been well?

22:24.519 --> 22:25.519
What is this?

22:26.349 --> 22:28.690
Why do you want to meet at places like this these days?

22:34.190 --> 22:35.230
Take this.

22:39.460 --> 22:42.369
You said this looked cool when you saw it on TV.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.299
You said you wanted to wear it.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.869
Thank you. I love it.

22:50.809 --> 22:52.180
Is your girlfriend doing well?

22:54.049 --> 22:55.049
Gi Seok.

22:56.579 --> 22:57.920
You're a cool kid.

22:58.119 --> 22:59.680
So value your life.

22:59.950 --> 23:02.589
And don't sleep with women you don't love...

23:02.589 --> 23:03.819
Are you going to church these days?

23:04.089 --> 23:05.460
Why are you giving me a sermon?

23:07.029 --> 23:08.059
I was...

23:10.299 --> 23:11.799
thankful to you all this time.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.599
I was happy thanks to you.

23:17.839 --> 23:20.839
Take it. This is what our relationship came down to.

23:24.210 --> 23:27.950
Hyo Ju, you're right. I didn't love you.

23:28.150 --> 23:29.880
But I don't want to live without you either.

23:30.150 --> 23:31.180
Money?

23:31.180 --> 23:33.349
You don't have to give it to me, so just keep seeing me.

23:37.490 --> 23:38.759
Thanks, Gi Seok.

23:40.130 --> 23:43.960
You saying that makes me feel less miserable.

23:46.730 --> 23:47.869
Let's have some tea.

23:49.029 --> 23:51.039
You like hot chocolate with whipped cream, right?

23:51.400 --> 23:53.440
- Yes. - That's your taste.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.640
You have to add a lot of cinnamon in your coffee too.

23:57.380 --> 24:00.549
Do you know what I usually drink...

24:00.549 --> 24:02.109
at cafes?

24:03.549 --> 24:05.319
You don't know what I like, do you?

24:06.480 --> 24:07.519
We...

24:10.920 --> 24:13.690
had different expectations for this relationship.

24:14.259 --> 24:16.289
It's my fault. I...

24:18.930 --> 24:20.470
fell in too deep all by myself.

24:23.640 --> 24:24.769
I'll bring the drinks.

24:33.779 --> 24:34.779
I'm...

24:36.079 --> 24:37.079
getting a divorce.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.650
I'm seeing someone.

24:41.890 --> 24:43.150
It's not...

24:43.390 --> 24:46.289
Don't worry. It's not Dr. Jang.

24:47.029 --> 24:50.730
Then who is it? Did you find another man already?

24:51.299 --> 24:54.799
Dr. Jang never loved me.

24:55.230 --> 24:56.670
I never loved him either.

24:57.369 --> 24:59.769
- We're just... - Stop it. It's dirty.

25:00.910 --> 25:05.180
I just want all of this to end.

25:06.480 --> 25:10.049
I want everyone to forget about what happened.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.789
Is this something that can be forgotten?

25:14.789 --> 25:16.890
It's not like I can wash it off with detergent...

25:16.890 --> 25:18.460
as if it's a washroom floor.

25:19.220 --> 25:20.259
I know.

25:20.630 --> 25:24.329
Hey, you sure live an easy life.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.829
I feel weird.

25:27.569 --> 25:30.569
So are you saying you were dating someone else...

25:31.200 --> 25:32.839
while you were seeing my husband?

25:33.470 --> 25:35.740
No, it wasn't like that. It was just...

25:35.769 --> 25:36.779
Just what?

25:39.410 --> 25:40.509
It was fate.

25:44.779 --> 25:46.019
- It's nice to meet you! - It's nice to meet you!

26:09.509 --> 26:10.539
Gosh!

26:10.539 --> 26:11.910
What do we do?

26:11.910 --> 26:13.509
(It's so pretty, that I'm ordering it right away.)

26:13.579 --> 26:15.109
(I'm sad that it sold out last week.)

26:17.720 --> 26:19.079
A Jin!

26:21.589 --> 26:23.920
Does this mean I have to look into a new factory?

26:24.160 --> 26:25.890
How am I going to fill all these orders?

26:26.119 --> 26:28.890
I know, right? You might have to hire more employees too.

26:29.059 --> 26:31.029
I'll manage the work of many by myself.

26:32.430 --> 26:35.299
Jin Hee, then go to the boutique to place these orders...

26:35.369 --> 26:36.670
and visit the factory, okay?

26:36.970 --> 26:38.170
Who's going to pick up Ji Hu?

26:39.640 --> 26:42.210
Her father who lost his job has been picking her up these days.

26:42.210 --> 26:43.210
Don't worry.

26:45.309 --> 26:48.210
The phone is currently turned off, so please leave a message...

26:48.309 --> 26:49.410
(Jae Gu)

26:57.589 --> 27:00.390
It's me. Where's my husband?

27:02.829 --> 27:05.000
You're asking me all sorts of questions now.

27:05.599 --> 27:07.329
How am I supposed to know that?

27:07.599 --> 27:09.099
If you don't, who does?

27:09.099 --> 27:11.039
Call the police and report him missing.

27:11.039 --> 27:14.240
That's the easiest way. Why are you asking me?

27:15.869 --> 27:16.940
I'm hanging up.

27:19.539 --> 27:23.309
You kept Ahn Jae Gu alive, right?

27:29.720 --> 27:32.359
Are you saying you want to hold a group exhibit...

27:32.359 --> 27:35.589
of 42 rookie artists at the New York Artpolitan Gallery?

27:35.990 --> 27:38.460
The New York Artpolitan Gallery and the France Dobi Gallery...

27:38.460 --> 27:39.500
are cosponsors.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.170
And our gallery has always supported it.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.099
Shouldn't we send an artist to represent our gallery as well?

27:45.099 --> 27:48.569
Of course. We should send our most promising painter.

27:49.970 --> 27:51.180
How about Yun Seong Hui?

27:55.980 --> 27:57.180
Why is everyone surprised?

28:06.519 --> 28:08.789
Hello, I'm Park Ji Yeong.

28:17.200 --> 28:20.240
I came to answer your question from last time, A Jin.

28:22.369 --> 28:25.410
My answer is no.

28:27.250 --> 28:29.079
- Is that so? - And...

28:30.349 --> 28:32.819
regarding Mr. Chairman's dementia diagnosis,

28:33.220 --> 28:35.619
the verification of its authenticity is important too,

28:35.750 --> 28:38.319
but Mr. Kim said Chairman Ahn...

28:38.359 --> 28:41.960
was in a very normal state of mind.

28:42.859 --> 28:43.859
Of course.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.930
He needs to say that to cover up his faults.

28:48.299 --> 28:51.099
If he knew that a feeble-minded chairman of a company...

28:51.099 --> 28:52.970
made the wrong decision,

28:53.509 --> 28:56.069
but went along with it as his lawyer,

28:56.240 --> 28:57.910
that would have been a professional mistake.

28:58.380 --> 29:00.579
If people find out, he'll get in trouble as well.

29:01.450 --> 29:02.980
I will file the lawsuit right away.

29:04.119 --> 29:06.250
I advise that you appoint an attorney too.

29:07.450 --> 29:10.490
You approached our father on purpose, right?

29:12.059 --> 29:14.859
You purposely got a job at that fitness club as a janitor,

29:15.059 --> 29:18.259
locked in our father as your target, and crept toward him.

29:19.259 --> 29:21.599
This lawsuit will start from there.

29:25.670 --> 29:28.369
Everything you did was planned.

29:29.410 --> 29:32.210
The uphill climb was easier than you thought, wasn't it?

29:32.380 --> 29:35.450
Your climb back down will be even easier. Look forward to it.

29:36.549 --> 29:39.720
You divorced him. You're no longer a part of the household.

29:41.119 --> 29:43.359
Why are you doing all of this?

29:45.920 --> 29:47.930
Let's just say I'm restoring social justice.

29:48.259 --> 29:50.400
I'm the one who brought you into that house.

29:50.930 --> 29:53.200
I should take responsibility for what I've done.

29:53.529 --> 29:56.700
And I was the one who introduced Ahn Jae Seok...

29:56.700 --> 29:58.500
to the woman he had an affair with.

29:59.470 --> 30:02.269
So I took responsibility for that as well.

30:02.910 --> 30:03.910
Through a divorce.

30:05.910 --> 30:06.910
I...

30:08.349 --> 30:10.849
will never have it taken away from me.

30:12.450 --> 30:15.619
You can't have it taken away if it was never yours, to begin with.

30:16.619 --> 30:17.990
What you did...

30:19.089 --> 30:20.230
was theft.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.700
Oh, gosh, ma'am. You look so elegant.

30:27.630 --> 30:29.329
I look like an actress now, don't I?

30:30.099 --> 30:32.640
- I love your style. - Thank you.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.400
Who...

30:59.829 --> 31:02.400
is it? Gosh, I don't know.

31:04.599 --> 31:07.140
Gosh, this is so bothersome.

31:32.160 --> 31:35.400
Gosh. Who wrapped this...

31:43.269 --> 31:44.740
What on earth...

31:46.509 --> 31:47.950
Gosh, seriously.

31:53.490 --> 31:55.450
I had a great experience thanks to you.

31:55.549 --> 31:57.819
I made salted hairtail today,

31:57.859 --> 32:00.059
so I sent you the leftover heads.

32:00.690 --> 32:02.329
They say the heads taste the best.

32:06.730 --> 32:08.470
How did she know I was here?

32:15.569 --> 32:17.180
Mr. Han.

32:19.279 --> 32:20.309
Darn it!

32:24.349 --> 32:26.950
It'd be better if Gu Bong Cheol can testify.

32:27.450 --> 32:28.589
He said he will.

32:30.420 --> 32:32.920
By the way, what are you going to do about your house?

32:33.319 --> 32:34.559
What about the property partition claim?

32:34.589 --> 32:37.259
I simply want to claim my property rights

32:37.259 --> 32:40.769
to the house where Ji Hu and I can live.

32:41.599 --> 32:42.700
I don't want anything more.

32:43.200 --> 32:46.369
Ahn Jae Seok appealed to the divorce ruling.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.009
He's a funny person.

32:59.420 --> 33:00.750
I don't know anything about this.

33:02.019 --> 33:05.420
She dared to send me something like this.

33:08.029 --> 33:10.930
I already know that she provided you with information...

33:11.000 --> 33:12.430
about me.

33:12.630 --> 33:13.869
It still doesn't matter.

33:14.700 --> 33:16.569
I heard you reported them to the national tax service.

33:16.799 --> 33:18.069
You informed the reporters too.

33:19.369 --> 33:21.710
Pung Suk's Kitchen is a funny place.

33:21.970 --> 33:24.380
I listen to stories about them every night...

33:24.710 --> 33:25.980
to relieve my stress.

33:27.150 --> 33:29.579
It's more realistic than any soap opera.

33:30.150 --> 33:32.220
- What are you saying? - That's right.

33:33.150 --> 33:36.589
All conversations in Pung Suk's Kitchen are recorded...

33:37.289 --> 33:40.089
and given to me by Pung Suk's Kitchen's boss.

33:40.859 --> 33:42.789
I pay her for them.

33:43.089 --> 33:46.700
Those recordings contain unbelievable information.

33:48.799 --> 33:49.869
Is that how...

33:54.509 --> 33:58.440
Are you saying you intentionally approached me?

33:58.579 --> 33:59.609
Of course.

34:00.009 --> 34:02.250
I heard that you'd enroll in Global Management Graduate School,

34:02.680 --> 34:06.519
and I even heard when you would start the program.

34:09.219 --> 34:13.090
Then why did you tell me to sell the company?

34:13.260 --> 34:15.730
Daesung Pulp is worth so much right now!

34:15.789 --> 34:17.730
7.5 million dollars is a steal!

34:18.059 --> 34:20.530
Oh, that's right. I received another one million dollars.

34:21.230 --> 34:24.869
From Ahn Jae Hui. She forged Chairman Ahn's power of attorney...

34:24.869 --> 34:26.539
to borrow one million dollars with his real estate as collateral,

34:26.539 --> 34:28.139
and she gave it to me as the deposit.

34:28.170 --> 34:29.739
She says she's going to take back the company.

34:30.980 --> 34:33.239
But the investment bank can't give her the intermediate payment.

34:33.510 --> 34:35.280
Because the investment won't be approved.

34:36.010 --> 34:38.050
It's possible if the board of directors approves it,

34:38.449 --> 34:39.650
but that won't happen either.

34:40.150 --> 34:44.320
So the deposit she borrowed will be out the window.

34:45.190 --> 34:47.829
In the end, I took over the company for 6.5 million dollars.

34:47.929 --> 34:51.030
I could get anything from that family without any effort.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.429
- You... - You're right.

34:55.900 --> 34:59.039
I prefer people from the lower class who are full of desires...

35:00.340 --> 35:01.570
just like you.

35:10.079 --> 35:13.250
What are you doing? Do you think I'm a joke?

35:13.250 --> 35:16.019
I do. Very much so.

35:16.590 --> 35:19.619
You're not suited for this world. You're too emotional.

35:20.929 --> 35:23.429
Do you know why lower-class citizens can't move up to the upper class?

35:23.730 --> 35:25.429
Because of sentimentalism.

35:25.829 --> 35:28.170
They probably call it humanity.

35:28.329 --> 35:30.099
But that's not true. It's defeatism.

35:30.469 --> 35:32.469
It's a game they can't win, so they drop out.

35:32.739 --> 35:36.110
And they stay in the lower class and bluff about how they're living...

35:36.210 --> 35:37.309
according to their means.

35:37.679 --> 35:39.639
You're a piece of trash.

35:41.849 --> 35:43.050
Did you call me trash?

35:44.349 --> 35:45.349
Then what are you?

35:47.019 --> 35:51.119
Park Bok Ja! Make up your mind! Go all the way!

35:51.119 --> 35:53.989
If you drove over the center line, just keep driving that way!

35:54.059 --> 35:56.800
Get into a head-on collision with an oncoming car,

35:56.929 --> 35:58.659
and crush that car completely!

36:02.929 --> 36:04.469
Why are you slowing down now?

36:04.869 --> 36:06.139
Did you actually like...

36:07.170 --> 36:08.539
that old man?

36:08.539 --> 36:09.769
Shut your mouth.

36:13.449 --> 36:14.449
Don't...

36:17.849 --> 36:19.550
Don't lay a finger on that house.

36:20.119 --> 36:21.250
It's already too late.

36:22.650 --> 36:24.159
They probably received the notice by now.

36:27.929 --> 36:31.130
Everyone was tangled up with one another...

36:31.130 --> 36:33.130
like a ball of yarn.

36:33.300 --> 36:36.429
I'm sorry. You weren't approved for the loan,

36:36.630 --> 36:38.300
so an additional loan can't be given.

36:38.639 --> 36:40.670
Wait, how can that be?

36:41.139 --> 36:43.539
I just did what Mr. Han told me to do!

36:43.679 --> 36:47.349
I mean, I even used my brother's stocks as collateral.

36:47.449 --> 36:49.909
- And the sale credit... - That was all considered...

36:49.909 --> 36:51.349
when the deposit of one million dollars...

36:51.420 --> 36:53.349
of one million dollars was loaned to you.

36:53.389 --> 36:56.550
No. If I don't deposit another one million dollars by the 12th,

36:56.860 --> 36:58.389
the contract will be canceled!

36:58.389 --> 37:00.559
You should talk to MK Capital about that.

37:00.659 --> 37:03.360
I've clearly explained our position. I should go.

37:03.730 --> 37:04.760
Mr. Park.

37:05.099 --> 37:06.199
Mr. Park!

37:06.460 --> 37:07.800
What do I do now?

37:08.469 --> 37:11.070
This is driving me crazy! What time is it?

37:13.469 --> 37:16.469
Hello? Mr. Han!

37:16.679 --> 37:20.150
Oh, no. You weren't approved for a loan, were you?

37:21.150 --> 37:22.650
That happens sometimes.

37:24.420 --> 37:27.550
- That's too bad. - You can't say that!

37:27.820 --> 37:29.920
I did this because you told me to!

37:31.019 --> 37:33.590
Hello?

37:35.389 --> 37:38.059
What do I do? What to do?

37:38.059 --> 37:40.070
That's when the misunderstandings began.

37:41.300 --> 37:45.300
Because we all thought this was a part of Park Bok Ja's scheme.

38:19.940 --> 38:21.510
- Is it good? - Yes.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.889
What on earth are you doing?

38:43.059 --> 38:46.429
Do you know how expensive this cosmetic product is?

38:48.170 --> 38:50.539
If you're going to run a business in Gangnam,

38:50.570 --> 38:53.340
you should use high-quality ingredients, don't you think?

38:57.110 --> 39:00.480
- Oh, my! - Gosh! What are you doing?

39:06.719 --> 39:08.250
Don't mess with me.

39:08.489 --> 39:12.420
If you mess with me one more time, I'll grind you up...

39:12.820 --> 39:15.659
and use you for salted seafood with kimchi.

39:22.070 --> 39:23.539
Darn it.

39:29.469 --> 39:31.210
How dare you send me the hairtail heads?

39:32.409 --> 39:35.050
You must have lost your mind.

40:31.269 --> 40:33.840
A Jin, I think we should open a shop!

40:33.840 --> 40:35.269
We should!

40:35.269 --> 40:38.239
But we can accept her generosity for now.

40:38.239 --> 40:39.280
My goodness.

40:40.250 --> 40:42.710
She lent me 20,000 dollars when I opened this shop...

40:42.710 --> 40:44.880
and told me to pay her back when I succeed.

40:45.119 --> 40:47.449
I still haven't paid you back yet,

40:47.449 --> 40:48.820
so I'll just deduct it from your rent.

41:06.539 --> 41:08.769
Why is she still so confident...

41:08.940 --> 41:10.780
even though she lost everything?

41:13.710 --> 41:16.980
And why aren't I confident at all...

41:17.920 --> 41:20.889
even though I have everything? Why?

41:25.460 --> 41:27.289
What do I have to do...

41:27.889 --> 41:29.559
to be just like her?

41:31.099 --> 41:35.130
Why is it that I can't smile like her?

41:36.500 --> 41:37.500
Why?

41:47.550 --> 41:48.710
Hi, Hyo Ju.

41:48.780 --> 41:51.179
I got a call from the portal manager today.

41:51.820 --> 41:55.650
A Jin, this is totally epic!

41:57.119 --> 41:58.260
What do you mean?

42:07.599 --> 42:09.199
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Woo.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.000
As I told you over the phone,

42:12.000 --> 42:14.269
our company would like to create a special line...

42:14.369 --> 42:16.170
for the upcoming season...

42:16.510 --> 42:18.639
with your products which I saw on the blog.

42:19.809 --> 42:21.650
I will support you wholeheartedly...

42:21.650 --> 42:23.480
and hold a fashion show for you as well.

42:23.579 --> 42:24.719
What do you think?

42:25.719 --> 42:27.050
I'll think about it.

42:27.090 --> 42:28.389
As you should.

42:28.920 --> 42:31.760
Then I'll propose our conditions first.

42:54.750 --> 42:55.880
What happened?

42:56.820 --> 42:59.550
You clearly told me there would be no problems with the loan.

42:59.719 --> 43:02.050
I heard about it from Mr. Park.

43:03.760 --> 43:05.519
I guess you weren't approved for the investment.

43:05.960 --> 43:06.960
Then...

43:07.960 --> 43:10.929
is our contract canceled?

43:11.059 --> 43:12.429
If you give me the intermediate payment...

43:12.429 --> 43:13.570
of one million dollars by tomorrow,

43:13.769 --> 43:14.929
there won't be a reason to cancel it.

43:14.929 --> 43:15.969
Gosh, seriously.

43:16.699 --> 43:20.670
Then let's just pretend like we never made this deal.

43:21.010 --> 43:24.409
I see. Well, if that's what you want.

43:26.239 --> 43:29.110
Are you going to refund me the one million dollars?

43:29.309 --> 43:32.019
- Pardon? - I mean, if it turned out this way,

43:32.019 --> 43:33.820
you should give me back my deposit.

43:33.949 --> 43:37.090
I mean, I have to give it back to the bank.

43:38.860 --> 43:41.090
This is why I like you, Jae Hui.

43:41.530 --> 43:44.030
You're really pure and naive for your age.

43:44.460 --> 43:46.699
I've never met anyone from a rich household who is so naive...

43:51.840 --> 43:53.070
in my life.

43:55.539 --> 43:56.780
Then what are you saying?

43:57.340 --> 44:00.250
Are you saying you won't give me my money back?

44:05.179 --> 44:07.489
Is this your first time negotiating...

44:08.090 --> 44:09.150
and signing a contract?

44:11.360 --> 44:13.730
Give me back my money! Give it back!

44:13.730 --> 44:15.360
I don't find crying women attractive.

44:16.460 --> 44:17.829
Give me back my money!

44:18.329 --> 44:21.329
Give the money back! I have to give it back to the bank.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.139
If I don't, we'll all die! All of us!

44:26.670 --> 44:27.739
Please!

44:28.309 --> 44:31.079
You just have to pretend like we never signed the contract.

44:49.590 --> 44:50.630
Hello?

44:51.860 --> 44:55.130
A Jin! I'm in trouble!

44:56.570 --> 44:58.469
I've been scammed!

45:08.250 --> 45:10.849
That gun incident. And the assault of his step-mother.

45:10.849 --> 45:14.050
My husband has gone missing. I'm unable to reach him.

45:14.090 --> 45:17.159
He's probably got drunk and slept at a sauna.

45:17.159 --> 45:18.260
I don't think that's the case.

45:20.090 --> 45:21.090
I think...

45:22.860 --> 45:24.699
someone kidnapped my husband,

45:25.829 --> 45:27.230
hurt him,

45:29.570 --> 45:31.139
or killed him.

45:32.539 --> 45:33.840
Why do you think that?

45:34.170 --> 45:36.070
Because my hunches have never been wrong.

45:38.139 --> 45:39.579
So please find him.

45:45.949 --> 45:47.590
- Name? - I know the suspect.

45:55.860 --> 45:58.929
I want to check something on the computer.

45:58.960 --> 46:00.670
Sure, ma'am. How can I help you?

46:01.500 --> 46:04.000
Can I take a look at a certified copy of the register?

46:04.170 --> 46:06.469
- A certified copy of the register? - Yes.

46:06.670 --> 46:08.469
(Division Registration, Obliteration data included)

46:11.179 --> 46:13.909
(House address, Building details, Other details)

46:15.949 --> 46:17.420
(Debtor: Ahn Tae Dong)

46:17.420 --> 46:22.090
The collateral security bank is CJS Bank.

46:24.159 --> 46:26.559
I'm Choi Ja Sil.

46:26.659 --> 46:28.630
She's the representative of CJS Investment Bank.

46:28.929 --> 46:30.230
Let's just say she is a big influence...

46:30.230 --> 46:31.599
in the black economy of our country.

46:42.809 --> 46:44.179
What on earth happened?

46:46.710 --> 46:48.010
Explain it to me slowly.

46:48.449 --> 46:50.420
We're in trouble, A Jin.

46:50.550 --> 46:52.519
It looks like we might end up penniless.

46:52.719 --> 46:53.719
We're...

46:54.849 --> 46:57.019
going to lose that house!

46:58.559 --> 47:00.159
- Pardon? - I was tricked, A Jin.

47:00.159 --> 47:01.489
What do I do?

47:01.730 --> 47:04.960
I might go crazy! I fell into a trap!

47:05.099 --> 47:07.170
I told you to explain slowly.

47:08.030 --> 47:11.000
I got a loan using our house as collateral.

47:11.269 --> 47:14.170
How did you get a loan without a certificate of Father's seal?

47:14.469 --> 47:18.110
I just did what Han Min Gi told me to do.

47:18.110 --> 47:19.840
But that bastard turned out to be...

47:20.409 --> 47:22.510
a con artist!

47:23.150 --> 47:24.380
Does Jae Seok know?

47:24.820 --> 47:26.650
What do I do now, A Jin?

47:26.949 --> 47:29.219
You're the only one in our family who can resolve this.

47:29.250 --> 47:30.989
I can't reach Jae Gu either.

47:33.489 --> 47:34.860
Gosh, seriously.

47:39.429 --> 47:42.829
Ji Hu, aren't you happy that I've been picking you up these days?

47:43.070 --> 47:44.139
Yes, I am.

47:45.099 --> 47:47.269
- You should eat too. - Okay.

47:51.110 --> 47:52.679
- Ji Hu. - Yes?

47:52.739 --> 47:54.380
You're the happiest when all three of us...

47:54.380 --> 47:55.579
are living together, aren't you?

47:55.750 --> 47:56.980
I am, but what's the use?

47:57.250 --> 47:58.380
We can do that again.

47:59.280 --> 48:01.119
Then say this to your mom.

48:01.690 --> 48:04.190
Tell her that you really want to live happily ever after...

48:04.219 --> 48:05.619
with your mom and dad.

48:05.889 --> 48:07.960
- So just... - Should I cry or something?

48:09.590 --> 48:13.900
I'm just saying, you have to do that to change your mom's thoughts.

48:14.670 --> 48:17.570
Dad, have you read "Snow White"?

48:18.070 --> 48:20.739
I haven't. There are seven dwarves in that story.

48:20.769 --> 48:22.610
I don't like books with lots of guys.

48:26.280 --> 48:27.809
I'm just kidding.

48:32.079 --> 48:34.590
- I've read it. - Don't make jokes like that.

48:34.750 --> 48:36.719
Is that the kind of joke a dad should make to his daughter?

48:37.590 --> 48:40.429
In that story, the queen keeps making the same mistake.

48:40.829 --> 48:44.000
At first, she tries to kill Snow White with a hunter,

48:44.099 --> 48:46.130
and then she tries to kill her with a poisoned apple.

48:46.130 --> 48:49.199
She did. Just because her mirror told her that Snow White...

48:49.230 --> 48:50.539
is prettier than her.

48:50.599 --> 48:52.099
That woman's hopeless.

48:52.199 --> 48:54.440
I noticed that people repeat the same mistakes.

48:54.440 --> 48:57.110
- That's right. They do. - And Mom knows that.

48:58.679 --> 49:00.909
Mom won't trust you from now on...

49:01.050 --> 49:03.179
because you made a really big mistake.

49:03.579 --> 49:05.079
Ji Hu, you can't do this to me.

49:05.079 --> 49:07.820
Dad, I'm in a difficult position.

49:08.190 --> 49:10.389
I can't just think of myself in this situation.

49:11.159 --> 49:13.730
If I think about Mom's life,

49:14.489 --> 49:15.829
I can't accept your request.

49:16.460 --> 49:19.599
Who's the one person that your mom and dad cherish the most?

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
- It's you. - If you knew that,

49:22.000 --> 49:23.099
why did you do it?

49:25.000 --> 49:28.139
Give it a rest. Mom gave you a chance.

49:28.269 --> 49:29.940
She didn't completely cut you off.

49:32.110 --> 49:33.909
Dad, you need to grow up some more.

49:34.150 --> 49:36.150
You're still too immature.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.320
Hurry up and eat.

49:41.289 --> 49:42.519
I don't have an appetite.

49:50.030 --> 49:53.800
I've been watching over him because A Jin asked me to.

49:53.829 --> 49:56.769
You can go. I'll watch over Father.

49:57.300 --> 49:59.340
- Can I do that? - Yes.

50:22.030 --> 50:23.460
Gosh, you scared me!

50:23.730 --> 50:24.900
You scared me!

50:25.000 --> 50:28.570
I've been waiting for you. Your man and my daughter are at home.

50:28.800 --> 50:30.300
Give them some more time together.

50:30.869 --> 50:32.500
Let's take this opportunity to talk.

50:40.809 --> 50:42.179
Let's just talk here.

50:42.480 --> 50:46.079
If we go to a nearby cafe, we'll become a spectacle.

50:47.250 --> 50:50.420
And we're not friendly enough to drive somewhere far together.

50:54.329 --> 50:56.860
You know you'll lose even if you sue me, right?

50:57.730 --> 51:01.000
You won't just lose, but you might have to compensate me too.

51:07.039 --> 51:09.969
I guess everyone can be foolish sometimes.

51:10.980 --> 51:12.610
I was foolish...

51:12.980 --> 51:15.909
for introducing a pretty artist like you to my husband without a worry.

51:16.849 --> 51:19.219
And you were foolish for signing an agreement without reading it.

51:20.489 --> 51:22.119
So get out of the house as soon as possible.

51:23.460 --> 51:26.190
You're too embarrassed to live in this apartment anyway.

51:26.320 --> 51:29.489
It's not fair. What did I do that was so wrong?

51:32.159 --> 51:36.230
You really don't seem to know what you did wrong.

51:37.469 --> 51:40.769
You're so clueless, but at least the almighty...

51:40.769 --> 51:42.139
gave you artistic talents.

51:45.179 --> 51:46.179
Let's make a deal.

51:48.210 --> 51:49.880
I'll send you to a New York art exhibit...

51:49.880 --> 51:51.550
as the artist representing our gallery.

51:53.550 --> 51:55.190
Your stance as an artist will change...

51:55.190 --> 51:57.360
as soon as you show your paintings there.

51:57.420 --> 51:59.559
The prices of your paintings will significantly increase too.

52:01.989 --> 52:03.090
So when do you want to move out?

52:03.599 --> 52:05.630
I'd like you to move out as you leave for New York.

52:10.869 --> 52:12.670
And what are you going to do about Ahn Jae Seok?

52:14.039 --> 52:15.210
I'll give him back to you.

52:16.039 --> 52:17.809
Are you returning him? Hey.

52:19.510 --> 52:21.179
All sales are final, ma'am.

52:21.179 --> 52:23.480
You can have Ahn Jae Seok back,

52:23.480 --> 52:26.019
but please give me back my painting.

52:26.119 --> 52:27.250
You better shut it.

52:27.420 --> 52:31.059
Please give me back my painting. That was one of my early works.

52:31.119 --> 52:33.059
Ahn Jae Seok was one of my early works too!

52:33.960 --> 52:36.429
Ma'am, I made a mistake.

52:36.429 --> 52:37.730
Don't you want to go to New York?

52:43.699 --> 52:44.800
Get out.

52:45.500 --> 52:46.940
Buy yourself a cup ramen at a convenience store...

52:46.940 --> 52:47.940
before you go inside.

52:48.039 --> 52:49.239
Then you'll be right on time.

52:53.039 --> 52:54.280
Aren't you getting out?

53:11.860 --> 53:15.329
Seoul is infested with people. Gosh.

53:18.769 --> 53:20.739
People of Seoul.

53:22.239 --> 53:24.079
I have a lot of money.

53:25.110 --> 53:26.340
I'm rich.

53:28.280 --> 53:29.280
But...

53:30.449 --> 53:32.579
I'm not happy at all.

53:36.489 --> 53:39.590
What can I do to become happy?

53:41.159 --> 53:43.159
What do I have to do to become happy?

53:47.269 --> 53:50.800
What am I supposed to do to become happy?

53:53.570 --> 53:57.440
I'm not happy at all.

54:09.849 --> 54:12.989
I'm not happy at all.

54:23.840 --> 54:27.969
Mom, Dad said he'll drop me off at Grandma's, so I'm leaving first.

54:28.409 --> 54:30.179
See you tomorrow. I love you.

54:32.780 --> 54:34.550
I managed to get this house back,

54:35.849 --> 54:37.480
but what will I do about their house?

55:05.079 --> 55:08.250
What do you think you're doing? You thief.

55:08.409 --> 55:11.280
Wait! Wait a minute! Listen to me carefully.

55:11.449 --> 55:14.519
This family is over. This household is done for.

55:14.719 --> 55:16.920
- So you should wake up too. - What?

55:17.760 --> 55:19.519
Ahn Jae Hui, that crazy wench...

55:19.519 --> 55:21.360
gave this house to the bank as collateral!

55:21.389 --> 55:22.429
It's over!

55:23.090 --> 55:25.829
- Where are you going? - Gosh.

56:03.369 --> 56:05.099
You wench!

56:09.940 --> 56:11.809
Your habit of slapping people hasn't changed.

56:12.079 --> 56:13.079
Give it back.

56:15.179 --> 56:17.320
You just tried to kill Chairman Ahn, didn't you?

56:17.349 --> 56:19.219
- No, I didn't! - What do you mean you didn't?

56:19.650 --> 56:20.719
I saw it all.

56:21.219 --> 56:22.389
I wanted to check.

56:23.289 --> 56:25.119
To see if Father actually collapsed.

56:31.300 --> 56:33.800
- Ju Mi, you should go home. - You can go.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.130
I have nothing to do with your household anymore.

56:36.130 --> 56:37.369
That's why you should leave.

56:38.739 --> 56:40.239
The house has been seized.

56:41.039 --> 56:43.579
- What did you say? - You need to hurry home.

56:52.679 --> 56:53.750
Park Bok Ja.

56:56.150 --> 56:58.190
Are you back for good?

57:02.489 --> 57:05.659
Okay. I'll come back.

57:06.869 --> 57:10.099
But I have one condition.

57:12.500 --> 57:13.539
I...

57:17.909 --> 57:21.579
need you to make me just like you.

57:23.309 --> 57:24.349
I...

57:25.780 --> 57:26.820
I...

57:29.150 --> 57:31.119
want you to make me just like you.

57:31.889 --> 57:35.460
Woo A Jin, make me just like you.

57:38.599 --> 57:39.630
Then...

57:41.769 --> 57:42.829
I'll...

57:43.940 --> 57:45.670
help you save Chairman Ahn.

57:50.840 --> 57:52.210
I'll do that.

58:13.159 --> 58:15.130
(The Lady in Dignity)

58:15.800 --> 58:17.340
Can you do as I say?

58:17.599 --> 58:19.570
Help Father wake up.

58:19.570 --> 58:23.210
She'll probably leave me if I wake up, right?

58:23.210 --> 58:26.039
Do you want to get your money back? Or...

58:26.210 --> 58:29.010
is it her heart that you want back?

58:29.050 --> 58:31.119
You'll have to see me in court.

58:31.119 --> 58:33.449
Aren't you colluding with Mr. Han Min Gi?

58:33.449 --> 58:35.320
I must take all the money she has.

58:35.320 --> 58:37.190
I cannot let a woman like her enter the upper class...

58:37.190 --> 58:39.219
without shedding a drop of blood.

58:39.219 --> 58:41.389
I couldn't stand her even the moment I first saw her.

58:41.530 --> 58:43.130
I'll do my best.

58:45.030 --> 58:46.329
I'm going crazy!

58:46.329 --> 58:49.170
Sue that con man and focus on getting the money back.

58:49.170 --> 58:52.070
Please make sure Ms. Woo won't have to worry about your family anymore.

58:52.070 --> 58:54.440
She looks exhausted these days because she's been working so much.

58:54.440 --> 58:56.369
Is there any word from Jae Gu?

58:56.369 --> 58:57.840
I think he's dead.

58:58.239 --> 59:00.150
I don't want to live with human trash...

59:00.150 --> 59:02.309
like you people in the same house.

59:02.309 --> 59:04.949
That house is mine now.

59:06.019 --> 59:07.719
I thought it was strange that she came back.

59:07.719 --> 59:09.519
That wench tried to kill Dad!

59:09.519 --> 59:12.420
Dad lost consciousness after eating blowfish porridge she gave him!
