WEBVTT

00:40.289 --> 00:41.958
Ah!

00:54.637 --> 00:56.430
- There you are, Tod.
- Shh!

00:56.514 --> 00:58.641
I found one.

00:58.724 --> 01:02.770
No way!
Look at the size of that thing.

01:02.812 --> 01:05.982
- Sure is ugly.
- It's a monster!

01:06.065 --> 01:10.236
I can smell its evil breath from here.

01:10.319 --> 01:13.573
No, uh, that's me.
I had socks for lunch.

01:13.656 --> 01:15.825
Ugh!

01:15.908 --> 01:17.743
Uh, how about you take this one?

01:17.827 --> 01:21.497
- Come on. We're a team, right?
- Wanna shake on it?

01:21.581 --> 01:23.875
Shake on it.

01:26.085 --> 01:30.006
- Ready... set...
- Go!

01:31.007 --> 01:34.302
Come on, Copper!

01:34.385 --> 01:36.470
Whoa!

01:36.554 --> 01:39.015
Come on, keep up!

01:39.098 --> 01:40.600
Wait for me!

01:44.854 --> 01:48.482
Huh?

02:02.371 --> 02:07.210
Whoa!

02:28.397 --> 02:30.358
We got him now!

02:50.253 --> 02:54.507
Ha-ha-ha! We chasing crickets,
or are we just hanging out?

02:54.590 --> 02:57.051
I messed up again.

03:01.097 --> 03:06.018
- I can't do nothing right.
- Hey, that's not true.

03:06.102 --> 03:10.147
You're... you're...
You're housetrained, ain't ya?

03:10.231 --> 03:12.900
Oh, Copper.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.198
Race ya!

03:20.241 --> 03:23.244
Wow! The trucks for the fair.

03:23.327 --> 03:26.080
I've never seen so much stuff in my life.

03:27.665 --> 03:30.793
Oh, boy! I can't wait.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.712
- Are you goin'?
- I'm-a goin'.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.714
- You goin'?
- I'm-a goin'.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.300
Chief says you
can win a ribbon there.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.303
- Really? For what?
- Just for being a good dog.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.556
Whoa!
That's a pretty good pumpkin.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.726
That one's even bigger.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.438
And noisier.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.654
Hey, Tod, do you hear that?

04:00.656 --> 04:02.783
Whoa! Oh!

04:02.867 --> 04:04.076
Oh!

04:18.007 --> 04:21.135
- You OK?
- Tripped over my own ears.

04:21.219 --> 04:26.307
See? I told ya.
I'm just a bad dog.

04:26.390 --> 04:28.559
Ah, don't be like that.

04:28.643 --> 04:32.355
- Copper!
- Uh-oh. Time for my hunting lesson.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.483
Hey, maybe I'll be good at hunting.

04:35.566 --> 04:39.445
Yeah! I'm gonna be
the huntingest puppy ever.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.114
Now you're talkin'.

04:52.208 --> 04:55.127
Let's see now.

04:56.212 --> 04:57.588
Copper!

04:57.672 --> 05:02.927
Copper! Oh, where did
that pup gone off to?

05:03.010 --> 05:04.929
Mm. Hmph!

05:09.141 --> 05:10.852
Hi, Chief.
Ready for my lesson.

05:10.893 --> 05:15.064
Oh, darn my hide.
Playing nursemaid to a pup

05:15.147 --> 05:18.025
when I should be a-practicin'
for the contest.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.611
Aw, you don't need to practice.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.030
You're the best hunting dog
in the whole county.

05:23.072 --> 05:26.951
Well, I reckon it's true.
I mean, they don't give

05:27.034 --> 05:30.037
those fourth-place prizes
to just anybody.

05:30.079 --> 05:34.792
Oh, there you are, Copper.
We'll make a hunting dog out of you yet.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.461
Here, here. Snuff this up.

05:37.545 --> 05:42.049
Now, when this rabbit takes off,
you follow his scent.

05:42.133 --> 05:47.722
Then when you have him, let loose with
a big ol' hound-dog howl!

05:50.266 --> 05:53.519
I must be going deaf.
I said howl!

05:59.442 --> 06:03.237
You're gonna lose your head
one of these days, Amos Slade.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.490
<i>It's my head, woman!</i>

06:06.574 --> 06:09.035
Good boy. Heh-heh.

06:09.118 --> 06:13.039
OK, Chief. Get goin'!

06:14.081 --> 06:17.835
- What are you waiting for? Go get him!
- Go, Copper!

06:26.552 --> 06:28.971
Attaboy, Copper!

06:31.224 --> 06:35.478
Ahh! Pup's as useful
as a milk bucket under a bull.

06:41.067 --> 06:44.612
Tod!
Oh, I'm getting all turned around.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.739
I don't know what I'm doing.

06:46.822 --> 06:49.992
It's easy.
You just sniff him out.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.287
When you smell him,
lift up your head and howl.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.164
Like this?

06:57.124 --> 06:59.126
No, not me!

07:02.505 --> 07:04.632
- Uh-oh.
- Gotta go!

07:11.430 --> 07:13.850
Ow! Ding-dang it all!

07:16.352 --> 07:19.480
Ha! I've got ya now.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.862
Come back here, you little varmint!

07:25.945 --> 07:27.780
Excuse me. Coming through.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.201
Uh-oh.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.744
Uh-oh.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.665
- My milk!
- Oh, no!

07:39.917 --> 07:43.796
Abigail, wait!
Amos Slade!

07:49.594 --> 07:51.846
I've gotcha now!

08:10.489 --> 08:12.033
Uh-oh.

08:15.494 --> 08:19.999
Amos Slade, I told you to keep
your beast away from my Tod!

08:20.082 --> 08:24.086
That mangy hound of yours
just cost me a bucket of milk!

08:26.005 --> 08:30.927
Your fox was after my chickens, Tweed!
What do I care about your milk?

08:31.010 --> 08:34.222
Well, as long as you're wasting my milk,

08:34.305 --> 08:37.099
you may as well have some pie
to go along with it.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.393
What the dickens are you...

08:46.776 --> 08:48.903
Bad dog, Copper!

08:48.986 --> 08:52.740
You are a very bad dog!

08:56.827 --> 09:00.498
Well, you can just forget
about the fair, Copper.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.250
Oh, dagnabit.

09:02.291 --> 09:06.337
You couldn't find a rabbit
at a petting zoo on Easter Sunday.

09:06.921 --> 09:10.383
There. That oughta keep
you out of trouble.

09:10.466 --> 09:13.052
Let's go, Chief.
Fair's a-waitin'.

09:21.978 --> 09:25.064
Aw, you'll get it one day, boy.

09:25.147 --> 09:28.276
You just gotta grow up a little, is all.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.261
He got you over a barrel, huh?

09:55.344 --> 09:58.347
Well, say something.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.475
There's nothing to say.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.687
It's just what I'm good for - nothing.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.815
You're real good at getting into trouble.

10:15.198 --> 10:17.408
'Course you're good at
something, Copper.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.494
We just gotta figure out what.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.665
You know what you need?
A little fun.

10:24.707 --> 10:28.503
I wonder if there's
a county fair around here.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.464
Come to think of it, there is!

10:31.547 --> 10:34.967
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a little tied up right now.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.179
Nothing a fox can't fix.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.684
Whoo-hoo!

10:57.490 --> 11:00.409
- What do you wanna do first?
- Everything.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.454
Mom! Fireworks, fireworks!

11:03.538 --> 11:07.041
Balloons! Ice cream!
Come on!

11:07.124 --> 11:09.794
- Fireworks.
- Oh, yeah.

11:09.877 --> 11:13.047
- We've gotta see 'em.
- Smack at sundown.

11:13.089 --> 11:16.759
Shake on it!

11:16.843 --> 11:20.054
There's that sound again.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.101
Sounds pretty good.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.729
Sounds like somebody got
their tail stuck in a door.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.705
Voice like an angel...
with looks to match.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.248
Oh, please.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.796
- Aah!
- Oh!

11:53.880 --> 11:56.465
Oh, my poor...

11:56.549 --> 11:59.594
Darn this one-horse,
two-bit, free-timing fair!

11:59.635 --> 12:03.931
Now, Dixie, it ain't like it smacked your
singing. Can we get back to rehearsing?

12:04.015 --> 12:06.767
I refuse to work under these conditions.

12:06.809 --> 12:10.021
- Uh-oh. Here we go.
- Well, I'll tell you what, Dixie.

12:10.104 --> 12:14.609
You rehearse, and afterwards I'll give
that piece of wood a good old talking-to.

12:14.650 --> 12:17.361
- I got two bones on Dixie.
- I'll cover that.

12:17.445 --> 12:21.699
It just so happens I am a professional,
and my standards...

12:21.782 --> 12:23.868
Oh, now, Dixie, darling,

12:23.951 --> 12:28.122
you put on that same old record every day.
Ain't it just about wore out by now?

12:28.164 --> 12:30.291
You have some nerve talking
to me that way.

12:30.374 --> 12:33.461
If your ear were any more tin,
they could can beans with it.

12:33.503 --> 12:37.882
Well, you listen to me, Miss Fancy Tail.
In a couple of days, we will be

12:37.965 --> 12:41.677
in front of that talent scout
from the Grand Old Opry.

12:41.761 --> 12:47.600
I get possibly maimed for life, and all you
can talk about is the Grand Old Opry?

12:47.683 --> 12:49.644
- Now, Dixie...
- I'll be in my trailer.

12:49.727 --> 12:54.690
Darling, we got a show to do.
You can't just walk...

12:54.774 --> 12:56.400
...away.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.531
Sometimes I dislike that woman.

13:01.614 --> 13:05.368
If they disliked each other any more,
they'd have to get hitched.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.121
- We're o...
- Ooh!

13:09.205 --> 13:11.165
Sorry, fellas.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.919
Oh, I can tell right now, this is gonna be
the worst show of all time!

13:15.002 --> 13:18.548
It's gonna be the worst!

13:18.631 --> 13:21.551
OK, let's have fun out there!

13:23.803 --> 13:26.681
- Cash, who will sing Dixie's part?
- Just give me a second.

13:26.722 --> 13:30.101
- I do a pretty good Dixie.
- Waylon, I don't picture you doing Di...

13:34.397 --> 13:36.858
Sit!

13:36.899 --> 13:40.444
OK. Here's the good news.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.698
Granny Rose, you are
singing Dixie's part.

13:43.739 --> 13:47.535
- Me?
- Oh, she's gonna love this one.

13:47.618 --> 13:50.454
We have a real treat for you now.

13:50.538 --> 13:54.333
Lyle Snotgrass and The Singin' Strays.

14:13.519 --> 14:17.607
You could almost swear
them dogs are really singing.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.857
Come on, kid. Sing with us.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.921
What?

15:37.228 --> 15:40.523
Yeah!

15:43.776 --> 15:46.195
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.991
Hot dog! Listen to 'em, Cash.
They love that number.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.827
Yeah, and if a cow had wheels,
it'd be a milk truck.

15:52.869 --> 15:56.497
That song is hokey.
They're clapping for this little puppy.

15:56.581 --> 15:59.458
Well, the kid's cute, all right.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.797
Ha-ha-ha!
Kid, I'll tell you what.

16:04.881 --> 16:07.550
You can sing!
You got pipes of gold.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.178
You sure do!

16:10.261 --> 16:12.430
- Hey, kid, what's your name?
- Copper.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.932
Copper, thanks for getting us
out of a tight spot.

16:15.016 --> 16:18.686
- It was fun!
- You got a future in show business, kid.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.272
You come back and see us
in a couple of years, you hear?

16:21.355 --> 16:26.444
- Yep, in a couple of years.
- 'Cause being in a band takes maturity.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.988
What?

16:29.071 --> 16:31.157
What?

16:33.075 --> 16:36.037
- What just happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.

16:36.078 --> 16:40.041
You're good at something,
and I mean good!

16:40.082 --> 16:41.667
Whoo-hoo!

16:44.879 --> 16:48.299
- Just what do you think you're doing?
- A little audience participation.

16:48.382 --> 16:51.385
- That kid wowed 'em.
- Kid? What kid?

16:51.427 --> 16:55.181
- Bye, Mr. Cash.
- That kid.

16:55.264 --> 16:59.435
- Little critter was heaven-sent.
- That sang my lead?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.729
Oh, no.
He didn't just sing it.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.023
<i>He sang it.</i>

17:04.106 --> 17:07.068
You don't mean to tell me
that wet-behind-the-ears puppy

17:07.109 --> 17:09.195
could ever take my place in a band.

17:09.278 --> 17:15.117
I didn't say that. Although he does have
that refreshing, blooming youth about him.

17:15.201 --> 17:19.288
- Just what exactly are you saying?
- What do you think I'm saying?

17:19.372 --> 17:22.875
- You're saying what I think you're saying.
- I think you know what I think I'm saying.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.962
You'd better know that what you're saying
isn't what I think you're saying.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.338
Why do you always...

17:27.421 --> 17:29.715
- Only 'cause you never...
- What if I said to you...

17:29.799 --> 17:32.468
Ooh! You know, this is just
like the time when you...

17:32.552 --> 17:36.097
You better not bring that up.

17:37.390 --> 17:42.645
Hmph! Well, I think we've both
been perfectly clear.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.481
Ohh, perfectly.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.483
- I quit!
- Huh?

17:50.820 --> 17:53.614
- Cash, what are we gonna do?
- She's gone with the wind.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.076
Sit!

17:57.160 --> 18:02.915
I'll take care of this. I'd better.
That talent scout will be here any minute.

18:12.717 --> 18:16.304
- Hi, there.
- Well, who are you?

18:16.345 --> 18:19.807
Olivia Farmer, designated chaperone
to Winchell P. Bickerstaff,

18:19.891 --> 18:23.186
talent scout
from the Grand Old Opry. That's you.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.979
Ahem. Chaperone, huh?

18:25.021 --> 18:28.024
I'm working to get
my community service merit badge.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.693
Well, that's quite admirable,
little lady.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.362
Then I'll have more
than Sally Ann Merrybaum.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.448
Thinks she's so great.

18:35.531 --> 18:40.328
Well, lead on, Miss Farmer.
I'm a-lookin' for some talent.

18:48.878 --> 18:53.925
Oh, Dixie, you ain't mad
over a little joshing, are ya?

18:55.968 --> 18:59.597
I was only teasing you.
You know how I feel about you.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.433
Yeah, you have a lousy way
of showing it.

19:05.686 --> 19:08.856
I am trying to kiss
and make up here.

19:08.940 --> 19:12.151
Now, won't you please
accept my apology?

19:13.152 --> 19:15.238
Blow it out your ear.

19:15.321 --> 19:19.033
All right, you diva dog,
but I'm in charge of this band,

19:19.116 --> 19:21.410
and ain't no one's indispensable.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.372
You're in charge?

19:24.413 --> 19:28.709
- Which one of us is in the driver's seat?
- Now, listen, you...

19:29.585 --> 19:32.088
Now you got me riled.

19:38.386 --> 19:39.762
All right!

19:41.347 --> 19:45.059
Yee-haw!
Ride 'em, cowboy, away!

19:45.101 --> 19:49.522
Whoo-hoo!
Yee-haw!

19:49.605 --> 19:52.400
All right!
This is the most fun ever!

19:52.483 --> 19:55.945
- Second-most fun ever.
- Mr. Cash.

19:55.987 --> 19:58.573
Kid, I saw how blissful
you looked singing.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.033
That had to be
the best time you ever had.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.119
Oh, for sure.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.955
Well, now, we can't let nothing
in the way of that.

20:13.045 --> 20:17.383
Like I was saying,
how'd you like to join the band?

20:17.466 --> 20:19.302
- Really? Huh?
- Yes, sir.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.305
Genuine Singin' Stray.
What do you say?

20:22.388 --> 20:23.681
Yeah!

20:23.764 --> 20:26.601
Copper, we were gonna
have some more fun.

20:26.642 --> 20:30.104
Well, Tod can be
in the band, too, right?

20:30.146 --> 20:32.773
- Well, uh...
- He's my best friend.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.358
Can you sing, kid?

20:34.442 --> 20:38.279
- Uh...
- 'Course he can sing. Show him, Tod.

20:44.619 --> 20:45.870
Whoa!

20:48.498 --> 20:51.209
Hoo-hoo!
Here's the good news:

20:51.292 --> 20:54.212
You're gonna be part
of the entourage-y.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.255
- What's that?
- That's French.

20:56.339 --> 20:59.175
Means you get to hang out with
our star here, keep him happy.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.801
He does that already.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.971
You know, fetch water, clean dog bowls -
fun stuff like that.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.974
- That's fun?
- Does Granny have fleas?

21:07.016 --> 21:09.393
Aw, come on, Todd.
It's gonna be great!

21:09.477 --> 21:12.063
Well... OK.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.357
All right, then.
Let's get moving.

21:16.275 --> 21:20.988
Wasn't he amazing, the way
he ate fire, Mr. Bickerstaff?

21:21.072 --> 21:23.324
Maybe you shouldn't
have stood so close.

21:23.366 --> 21:27.078
Now you tell me.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.333
- OK.
- Hey, Dixie.

21:32.375 --> 21:37.588
- You come crawling back.
- Oh, by the way, you can't quit.

21:37.672 --> 21:41.676
- You're fired.
- Oh! What? You can't fire me!

21:41.717 --> 21:45.429
I already quit!
Cash, you... Oh!

21:46.013 --> 21:48.933
Now you've got me riled.

21:49.559 --> 21:52.854
Ohh!

21:55.189 --> 21:58.651
Ah, don't get your collar
in a bunch, Dixie. Pitch a fur ball.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.946
The nerve of that Cash!
Where's he get off firing me?

22:02.029 --> 22:04.448
Oh, I thought you quit.

22:04.532 --> 22:08.870
I'm that man's heart and soul!
It's plain as a pig on a sofa.

22:10.913 --> 22:16.002
That Cash can talk a dog off a meat truck.
He talked me into getting sweet on him,

22:16.085 --> 22:20.214
and now he tosses me away
like yesterday's cornbread!

22:20.256 --> 22:22.884
Honey, I don't blame you
for feeling hurt.

22:22.925 --> 22:26.929
Hurt? What do you mean by that?
You think Cash could hurt me?

22:35.188 --> 22:37.148
Mangy mutt.

22:40.943 --> 22:44.280
Oh, you'll howl real good
today, fellas.

22:44.363 --> 22:48.868
Oh, well, there's more
than one way to skin a cat.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.953
- Ahem.
- No offense.

22:51.037 --> 22:55.458
Soup's on!
That's a good boy right there!

22:55.541 --> 22:58.211
All right, fellas, all right.
Calling out the team.

23:01.547 --> 23:06.010
You know, if I could just play the banjo
better, y'all would be eating steaks.

23:06.093 --> 23:09.138
Hey! I guess I'd better go practice.

23:09.222 --> 23:12.391
Welcome to the band, kid.
Let me do some introductions.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.852
That there is Waylon and Floyd.

23:16.312 --> 23:19.774
They're the, uh, brains of the outfit.

23:19.857 --> 23:24.320
Oh, why I put up with this
low-class crew of mutts is beyond me.

23:25.488 --> 23:29.283
Uh, and that delicate flower
is Granny Rose.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.953
Textbook version of growing old gracefully.

23:32.036 --> 23:33.496
I got me an itch.

23:33.579 --> 23:38.960
Yep. You'll never harmonize
with a finer group of singing strays and...

23:39.001 --> 23:42.588
Uh, you are a stray, right, boy?

23:45.341 --> 23:48.135
- Uh...
- 'Course he's a stray.

23:48.219 --> 23:50.263
You don't see a collar
around him, do ya?

23:50.346 --> 23:52.181
- Well, that's true.
- I don't see one.

23:52.265 --> 23:54.767
No collar, no home.

23:54.851 --> 23:59.272
Whoo! Good.
Only strays allowed in this dog band.

23:59.355 --> 24:03.150
- Tod, I'm not a stray.
- Shh!

24:03.192 --> 24:05.278
It'll be our secret.

24:08.531 --> 24:12.034
Ha-ha. Just wait till Copper sees this.

24:12.118 --> 24:15.121
Another fourth-place ribbon.
Ha-ha.

24:15.204 --> 24:18.166
Next year, we're going for the three-peat.

24:18.249 --> 24:20.334
- Oh!
- What the...

24:20.376 --> 24:22.545
- Widow Tweed.
- Hmm?

24:22.628 --> 24:26.090
Oh! Do you make a career
out of getting in my way?

24:26.174 --> 24:29.802
Step aside, woman.
I got a prize-winner coming through.

24:29.886 --> 24:32.138
- Well, so do I.
- What?

24:32.221 --> 24:35.725
This here's a hunting dog.
What could you do with a pie?

24:37.977 --> 24:40.062
Uh... Oh, yeah. Oh.

24:41.689 --> 24:46.777
Woman's got spunk.
I'll give her that. Hmph!

24:56.204 --> 25:00.666
OK, fellas, ten minutes till curtain.
Let's round 'em up and move 'em out.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.335
Move 'em, round 'em.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.337
I'm movin'.

25:04.420 --> 25:07.381
- That means you, Copper.
- Huh?

25:07.465 --> 25:09.050
Whoa!

25:17.266 --> 25:20.019
- Good luck, Copper.
- Thanks, entourage-y.

25:20.102 --> 25:23.731
Say, Tod, while we're on, why don't you
spiff up those bowls a little bit?

25:23.773 --> 25:27.818
The bowls? OK, Cash.

25:29.779 --> 25:33.407
Don't forget - fireworks.
Smack at sundown.

25:33.449 --> 25:35.535
It's a promise.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.749
Psst! Little darling.

25:41.791 --> 25:45.294
Come on in.
Dixie wants to talk to ya.

25:47.255 --> 25:50.925
- But I'm supposed to sing now.
- Oh, I know, I know.

25:51.008 --> 25:54.220
I just wanted to pass along
my secret of success.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.764
Really? Thanks, Miss Dixie.

25:56.806 --> 26:01.519
Before every show,
take a big ol' helping of that.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.189
Peanut butter?

26:05.273 --> 26:08.234
All right, let's get
to growling and howling.

26:08.317 --> 26:11.153
Now... Granny Rose,
go fetch Copper, will you?

26:11.237 --> 26:15.324
Ah, uh... Hang on.
Ooh, ah. Oh, that's good.

26:18.411 --> 26:23.249
Uh-oh. Bad news in a rhinestone collar.

26:23.332 --> 26:27.003
Oh, why, Cash, you look as
nervous as a long-tailed cat

26:27.086 --> 26:28.838
in a room full of rocking chairs.

26:28.921 --> 26:32.091
'Cause I'm busy as a farmer with
one hoe and two rattlesnakes.

26:32.175 --> 26:36.846
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm as... as...
Oh, I got nothing.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.806
- What is it, Dixie?
- Oh...

26:38.848 --> 26:41.809
I just thought you could
use a lead singer.

26:53.863 --> 26:57.992
Peanut butter?
But, Copper, you have to sing!

26:58.075 --> 27:02.413
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

27:08.711 --> 27:11.797
Oh, hold on, Copper.
I'll be right back.

27:20.223 --> 27:24.352
The winner of the milking
contest is the Widow Tweed

27:24.393 --> 27:26.812
and her fine cow Abigail!

27:28.064 --> 27:29.398
Ohh!

27:29.482 --> 27:30.983
What?

27:40.576 --> 27:42.829
Copper! Come on out!

27:42.912 --> 27:44.956
Perfect! Just like that!

27:50.419 --> 27:51.671
All right!

27:51.754 --> 27:53.965
- Moo!
- Ha-ha-ha!

27:54.048 --> 27:58.386
- You know darn well that Copper is...
- Copper? You mean that little pup?

27:58.427 --> 28:00.680
Why, he ran off
with that fox friend of his

28:00.763 --> 28:02.890
like a bank robber on roller skates.

28:03.474 --> 28:05.476
- You're kidding.
- Hey, if I'm lying,

28:05.560 --> 28:08.020
may my fur lose its natural luster.

28:08.104 --> 28:10.064
That did it! I can sing!

28:10.106 --> 28:12.441
Great. When you get out
there, don't forget to...

28:12.525 --> 28:17.446
O-O-OK.
See you at the fireworks, right?

28:17.488 --> 28:20.908
Get used to it... entourage.

28:23.452 --> 28:27.290
- This is how it's gonna be from now on.
- What do you mean?

28:27.373 --> 28:33.671
While he's off having fun and getting
the glory, he'll stick you with the chores.

28:33.754 --> 28:36.007
No, Copper isn't like that.

28:36.090 --> 28:40.052
Yeah.
Well, we'll see, won't we?

28:41.721 --> 28:43.723
Here I am!
Ohh!

28:45.725 --> 28:48.561
Huh. Ran off, huh?

28:48.644 --> 28:50.146
Sorry, Dix.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.566
Peanut butter?

28:53.649 --> 28:56.777
Oh, Dixie.
You are through.

28:56.819 --> 29:00.823
Well, getting rid of me
ain't gonna be so easy, Cash.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.200
Whoa!

29:04.160 --> 29:05.661
That looked easy.

29:05.745 --> 29:08.581
Remind me to give that piece
of wood a bonus.

29:11.167 --> 29:15.004
Look, Miss Farmer, this ain't the kind of
talent I'm a-looking for.

29:15.087 --> 29:20.968
Yeah, you're right.
That flea circus was totally amateur hour.

29:21.093 --> 29:24.263
Waylon, give me a back beat.

29:24.347 --> 29:26.807
We are headed for the big time,

29:26.849 --> 29:30.978
and I got a big-time song to take us there.

29:31.020 --> 29:34.190
Follow my lead, kid.

30:27.535 --> 30:30.288
Oh, he's just so darn cute.

30:33.457 --> 30:36.502
Oh, Cash, I'm supposed
to meet Tod soon for the...

30:36.586 --> 30:39.172
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We can't let nobody hold us back.

30:39.255 --> 30:43.176
We're hound dudes, remember?

31:11.412 --> 31:14.707
Wow. Awesome.

31:32.892 --> 31:36.145
I've never been so high up in my life.

31:36.229 --> 31:38.940
I think I was higher
than the fireworks.

31:38.981 --> 31:41.359
Yeah, and how about
those free hot dogs?

31:41.442 --> 31:45.279
You looked happier than a hog
at Sunday potluck.

31:45.321 --> 31:47.490
All right.
Meet you backstage, kid.

31:47.573 --> 31:51.118
- We got a lot of work to do.
- You got it, Cash.

31:51.160 --> 31:55.665
- Oh, sorry, Tod.
- Hey, Copper, how's the Ferris wheel?

31:55.748 --> 32:00.127
The fireworks!
Oh, gosh, I forgot.

32:00.169 --> 32:03.714
Cash and I were busier
than two mice in a cheese shop.

32:03.798 --> 32:07.718
- Too busy for your best friend?
- It's not like that, Tod.

32:07.802 --> 32:09.720
Cash said I had
to let everyone see me.

32:09.804 --> 32:12.014
Cash said it's good
for the band. Cash said...

32:12.098 --> 32:17.395
"Cash said, Cash said."
Who cares about Cash?

32:17.478 --> 32:21.774
Tod, what's wrong? Are you jealous?

32:21.858 --> 32:23.818
'Course not, you dumb dog.

32:23.901 --> 32:26.863
- Then what's eating you?
- I don't know.

32:26.904 --> 32:29.740
It's like, you're not around anymore.

32:35.204 --> 32:39.709
Well, I'm around now. Let's do something.

32:39.792 --> 32:42.378
I mean, if you wanna.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.005
Now?

32:44.088 --> 32:47.049
- Shake on it?
- Shake on it.

32:47.091 --> 32:52.513
Kid, I swear you're slow as an iron toad.
Come on, you're holding us up. Let's go.

32:52.555 --> 32:56.184
Waylon, would you get up? We got more
ground to cover than the Pony Express.

32:56.267 --> 32:58.394
Now, let's get to work, hounds!

33:01.772 --> 33:06.235
- I guess I gotta go.
- But... but, Copper...

33:06.319 --> 33:09.405
I'll see you later, OK?

33:17.747 --> 33:21.626
Yeah? Well, maybe you will
and maybe you won't!

33:36.682 --> 33:41.020
Why eat 'em, Dix? Might as well
just slap 'em right on your hips.

33:42.647 --> 33:45.149
Come on, Zelda. I need a drink.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.745
Give me one straight.

34:01.123 --> 34:03.084
Give me that.

34:09.632 --> 34:13.094
Oh, darling. You look like
something the cat dragged in.

34:13.177 --> 34:15.888
- Ahem.
- Oh, no offense.

34:17.807 --> 34:21.227
- What do you care?
- Oh, come on, Tod.

34:21.310 --> 34:24.981
We're both
in the same old briar patch now.

34:25.064 --> 34:29.235
Cast off by the one we care about the most.

34:30.695 --> 34:33.531
Guess you know how that feels now.

34:33.614 --> 34:36.576
- Copper's forgotten all about me.
- Yeah.

34:36.659 --> 34:40.454
- I heard that. Hurts worse than anything.
- Yeah.

34:40.496 --> 34:43.291
I remember this one tom cat
named Leroy...

34:43.374 --> 34:46.043
I'm talking to the fox.

34:56.637 --> 35:01.601
You see, Tod, relationships
and show business, they just don't mix.

35:01.684 --> 35:04.478
Oh, it starts out nice and friendly.

35:04.520 --> 35:09.400
Then they get that first taste of fame,
and it's "look out for number one."

36:04.330 --> 36:07.041
All right, let's get to crooning.

36:25.935 --> 36:27.353
Cold noses.

37:44.347 --> 37:47.934
Not even a little-bitty bone.

37:58.861 --> 38:02.782
Now, that's a good little doggie.

38:02.865 --> 38:06.619
And you know what?
He wouldn't even be in that dumb old band

38:06.702 --> 38:09.121
if I hadn't lied for him.

38:09.205 --> 38:13.334
- Come again?
- I got Cash to think he was a stray.

38:13.376 --> 38:17.463
Copper's no stray.
He lives just down the road apiece.

38:17.547 --> 38:20.967
Well, darling, all our troubles are over.

38:21.050 --> 38:23.928
How'd you like
to get your best friend back?

38:24.011 --> 38:26.222
- But how?
- Heh-heh-heh.

38:26.305 --> 38:30.184
Just listen close to old Dixie here.

38:45.783 --> 38:49.495
Whoa, whoa. That last note was flatter
than a duck's footprint.

38:49.579 --> 38:51.831
Take it from the top, please.

38:51.914 --> 38:55.334
Oh, but, Cash, we've been at it all night.

38:55.418 --> 38:58.421
And we'll be at it all day
if that's what it takes.

38:58.504 --> 39:01.090
This ain't just another show.

39:01.174 --> 39:05.094
The scout from the Grand Old Opry
is gonna be watching.

39:06.179 --> 39:08.181
Take it from the top.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.977
Copper. Just what are you doing?

39:13.060 --> 39:16.981
Well, it's a cricket. Me and Tod used to...

39:17.064 --> 39:20.193
What is the matter with you, kid?
Don't you wanna be a star?

39:20.276 --> 39:22.904
- Well... sure.
- Well, then, why don't you...

39:22.987 --> 39:25.490
Cash. He's just a pup.

39:27.950 --> 39:32.705
Copper's just having a little fun.
You do remember fun, don't you?

39:34.916 --> 39:37.335
OK. All right.

39:37.418 --> 39:40.755
Just take five, everyone.

39:41.422 --> 39:44.091
Sweetie pie, don't take it to heart.

39:44.133 --> 39:46.677
Cash's bark is worse than his bite.

39:46.761 --> 39:50.973
And if he growls at us again,
I'm gonna muzzle him myself.

40:05.696 --> 40:07.240
Tod?

40:10.827 --> 40:13.079
Tod.

40:14.497 --> 40:16.791
You in there?

40:28.594 --> 40:31.556
Cash, you have seen Tod?

40:31.639 --> 40:35.017
Nope. Dixie ain't around neither.

40:35.935 --> 40:38.855
You were looking for her?

40:38.938 --> 40:40.481
No.

40:43.025 --> 40:44.193
Well...

40:45.862 --> 40:48.156
I remember when I first met her.

40:48.239 --> 40:52.201
I was just a little old stray like you,
all paws and ears,

40:52.285 --> 40:54.453
and felt like a real good-for-nothing.

40:54.537 --> 40:56.330
- You?
- Yeah.

40:56.414 --> 41:01.669
And then one night, we went a-howling
at the moon, and I found out we could sing.

41:01.711 --> 41:08.050
I said, "Dixie, this is our ticket to success.
We are gonna be stars."

41:09.886 --> 41:15.808
I guess I'd be stretching it
if I said I didn't want her around sometimes.

41:15.892 --> 41:18.352
But we're a couple of hound dudes now,
remember?

41:18.394 --> 41:22.523
We can't let old friends get
in the way of that, right?

41:22.607 --> 41:26.360
- I guess not.
- Oh, come on. You're having fun, ain't ya?

41:26.444 --> 41:28.654
Ha! Are you kidding?

41:28.738 --> 41:33.409
Well, you just wait till we're on top.
We are so close, I can smell it.

41:33.493 --> 41:36.871
The Grand Old Opry.

41:36.913 --> 41:40.041
All we gotta do is ace that audition.

41:40.082 --> 41:42.835
- Right?
- Heh-heh-heh. Right.

41:46.506 --> 41:50.426
- Come on. Let's go rehearse some more.
- Attaboy.

41:53.471 --> 41:55.473
Copper!

41:56.599 --> 41:58.434
Copper!

41:58.518 --> 42:02.522
Oh, where could that pup
have gotten off to?

42:03.105 --> 42:05.483
Copper!

42:12.281 --> 42:14.909
Tod! Oh, Tod!

42:14.951 --> 42:17.662
Widow, what are you doing up
this time of night?

42:17.745 --> 42:23.167
Oh, I can't find my Tod anywhere.
That pup of yours probably chased him off.

42:23.251 --> 42:26.337
I wouldn't know. I can't find him.

42:26.420 --> 42:28.589
Oh...

42:28.631 --> 42:33.761
Well, if I see a sign of your puppy,
I'll give you a holler.

42:33.803 --> 42:41.102
I'm obliged. If I see hide or hair
of that fox of yours, well...

42:43.271 --> 42:45.773
Thank you, Amos.

42:46.899 --> 42:48.276
Tod!

42:48.776 --> 42:50.403
Tod!

42:50.486 --> 42:52.697
Oh, Tod.

42:52.780 --> 42:54.699
Copper!

42:54.782 --> 42:56.576
Tod!

43:06.127 --> 43:08.212
Oh, my hair.

43:08.921 --> 43:10.423
Hmph!

43:13.176 --> 43:14.135
Ugh.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.762
Broke a nail...

43:18.848 --> 43:23.352
- That's where Copper lives.
- Nice spread. Could use woman's touch.

43:24.103 --> 43:26.606
You sure this is a good idea?

43:26.689 --> 43:32.403
It's the only way. When Clem Clod-kicker
over there gets to the fair and sees Copper,

43:32.487 --> 43:36.240
he'll bring him home for sure.
You two will get to be friends again,

43:36.324 --> 43:39.911
and I will reclaim my rightful place
in the spotlight.

43:39.994 --> 43:44.165
Hmm. We just gotta figure out
how to get them to follow us.

43:44.207 --> 43:45.208
Heh-heh.

43:45.291 --> 43:48.794
That's the easy part.
See, old Chief there hates me,

43:48.878 --> 43:54.342
but he couldn't catch a cold in winter,
and wherever Chief goes, Slade follows.

43:54.467 --> 43:57.386
Well, let's see your stuff there, cowboy.

44:04.727 --> 44:07.021
Psst! Chief!

44:10.274 --> 44:11.984
Chief!

44:22.495 --> 44:24.497
Oh, that tickles.

44:28.626 --> 44:30.670
Huh?

44:34.715 --> 44:35.758
Wha...

44:35.842 --> 44:38.177
- Oh!
- Ooh, ooh.

44:38.261 --> 44:42.306
Snuggly-wuggly little pookie-pooh.

44:43.766 --> 44:45.685
Yow!

44:51.274 --> 44:53.860
Chief, what the devil...

45:02.702 --> 45:04.912
- Tod!
- Eh!

45:04.954 --> 45:07.540
It's that darn critter of yours!

45:07.623 --> 45:10.793
My critter? It's your hunt...
Oh, my! Oh, dear!

45:10.877 --> 45:13.379
When I get my hands on you...

45:16.090 --> 45:18.134
Tod, I'm coming!

45:22.638 --> 45:25.183
I gotcha in my sight!

45:26.309 --> 45:28.728
You can't get away from me!

45:28.811 --> 45:32.565
I'm a fourth-place winner two times over.

45:32.648 --> 45:35.067
Why, you! Come back here!

45:35.151 --> 45:37.945
Ah, Chief, come back!

45:45.495 --> 45:47.622
Testing. Testing.

45:47.663 --> 45:52.043
Why, Cash, look at you.
You're nervous as a flea on dip day.

45:52.126 --> 45:57.048
- I haven't seen you like this in a long time.
- You ain't never seen me like this, Granny.

45:57.131 --> 46:00.468
I just hope that talent scout fella's
in a good mood.

46:01.010 --> 46:06.265
You know, that snake charmer could use
a little more practice. Don't you think?

46:06.349 --> 46:08.017
Aah!

46:23.324 --> 46:26.035
Oh! Hey! Hey! Aah!

46:35.711 --> 46:38.339
Get the lead out of them boots,
Mr. Bickerstaff.

46:38.381 --> 46:40.842
The talent show's just about to start.

46:40.925 --> 46:43.511
Aah!

46:43.594 --> 46:45.930
I know. I'm excited too.

46:46.597 --> 46:50.351
Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Ugh! Ugh!

47:12.707 --> 47:16.169
- Mm! Blueberries.
- Oink!

47:30.516 --> 47:31.767
Aah!

47:33.519 --> 47:35.605
Aah!

47:38.524 --> 47:42.028
Here we are, Mr. Bickerstaff.
Just in time.

47:42.111 --> 47:46.240
Ladies and gentlemen, The Singin' Strays!

47:50.703 --> 47:53.581
Coming through! Excuse me! Pardon me!

47:55.291 --> 47:56.417
- Tod?
- Copper?

47:56.501 --> 47:57.960
- Chief!
- Tod!

47:58.044 --> 48:00.213
Copper! That's my dog!

48:00.296 --> 48:03.257
You ain't a stray?

48:03.841 --> 48:04.842
Aah!

48:06.135 --> 48:07.512
Aah!

48:07.595 --> 48:09.555
What in tarnation?

48:20.149 --> 48:22.652
Dixie, what have you done?

48:23.277 --> 48:27.949
Where they going? Wait. We can't let'em
leave. We got a show to do. Wait!

48:34.997 --> 48:38.793
That's it! I can't take anymore.

48:38.835 --> 48:41.629
I don't book no circuses!

48:58.688 --> 49:01.149
Why, thank you, little lady.

49:02.942 --> 49:05.945
- You've been so kind.
- Drive careful.

49:08.531 --> 49:11.951
Bye, Mr. Bickerstaff. See ya next year!

49:12.034 --> 49:13.995
Ohh!

49:17.540 --> 49:19.750
What are we gonna do now, Cash?

49:19.834 --> 49:22.295
You're gonna go home.

49:22.378 --> 49:25.464
- But the band...
- Don't you get it?

49:25.548 --> 49:27.675
You're fired!

49:32.972 --> 49:37.768
You know what? You used to be
a lot more fun to be around.

49:37.852 --> 49:40.771
Oh, now, come on. Where are you going?

49:40.855 --> 49:43.065
Hey!

49:43.149 --> 49:47.278
Oh, yeah? Fine! We don't need you, either.
Right, boys?

49:49.197 --> 49:54.368
- Sorry, Cash.
- It just ain't no fun anymore.

49:55.870 --> 49:59.665
Why does it always rain
when things go wrong?

49:59.749 --> 50:02.668
I don't know, Floyd.

50:10.593 --> 50:12.595
Happy now?

50:19.602 --> 50:23.272
Copper, I'm sorry. I just wanted to...

50:23.356 --> 50:26.234
You ruined everything!

50:27.109 --> 50:29.111
Copper!

50:33.241 --> 50:35.243
Attaboy.

50:37.036 --> 50:39.497
Let's get outta here.

50:44.794 --> 50:48.589
Oh, Tod. There, there, now.

51:26.002 --> 51:27.461
Oh! Oh!

52:30.316 --> 52:32.735
Copper?

52:32.819 --> 52:34.570
Dixie?

52:34.654 --> 52:37.240
What are you doing here?

52:39.408 --> 52:44.121
I just thought you should know
that blowing your cover was my idea.

52:44.205 --> 52:46.791
Not Tod's.

52:46.874 --> 52:51.587
I guess I just lost sight
of what's really important.

52:51.671 --> 52:54.841
And, darling, I'm awful sorry.

52:54.924 --> 52:58.344
He never wanted to hurt you.

52:58.427 --> 53:01.264
He just wanted you to be his friend again.

53:04.642 --> 53:08.563
Well, that's what I came to say.

53:35.214 --> 53:36.340
Copper?

53:38.634 --> 53:41.179
- Hi.
- Hi.

53:41.846 --> 53:46.392
- Are we still friends?
- I don't know. Aren't you all mad?

53:46.976 --> 53:49.812
Well, I've been thinking,

53:49.896 --> 53:52.482
I've been kind of a cabbage head.

53:52.565 --> 53:56.319
If that ain't right, grits ain't groceries.

53:56.402 --> 54:00.907
Well, anyway, I sure am sorry.

54:00.990 --> 54:04.660
Yeah, and I'm sorry too.

54:04.744 --> 54:08.247
Hey! I just got a great idea. Hang on.

54:08.331 --> 54:10.750
Got something for you.

54:10.833 --> 54:14.086
Thanks, but I didn't get you anything.

54:14.128 --> 54:19.800
No, no. It belongs to the talent scout.
I figure you could use it to find him.

54:19.884 --> 54:23.262
You know, if you still want that audition.

54:23.346 --> 54:26.557
- How?
- You're a real hunting dog, aren't you?

54:26.641 --> 54:29.143
And this here hat is his address.

54:32.522 --> 54:35.441
Yeah, that's it. Get a good whiff.

54:36.859 --> 54:40.863
OK, you get the scout,
and I'll go get the band.

54:44.367 --> 54:47.286
Lyle, you fool. There's your problem.

54:47.370 --> 54:50.414
The doohickey is coming out
of the whatchamacallit

54:50.498 --> 54:52.542
and leaking all over the hoozanozzle.

54:52.625 --> 54:55.294
Cash! Cash!

54:55.378 --> 54:57.797
- Dixie's in trouble!
- What's happened?

54:57.880 --> 55:00.883
What's wrong?

55:00.967 --> 55:02.969
Sit!

55:03.636 --> 55:05.972
- Where is she?
- Follow me.

55:07.390 --> 55:11.978
All right, that'll do it.
All right, fellas. We are off to...

55:12.061 --> 55:13.187
Uh...

55:13.271 --> 55:15.314
fellas?

55:15.398 --> 55:17.483
Waylon? Cash?

55:18.943 --> 55:20.111
Anybody?

55:25.867 --> 55:26.951
Huh?

55:35.918 --> 55:37.795
Doh!

55:44.427 --> 55:45.720
Huh? Huh?

55:48.431 --> 55:51.309
- Well, where is she?
- Uh...

55:51.392 --> 55:52.685
Um...

55:52.768 --> 55:54.520
Huh?

55:57.565 --> 55:59.025
Thataway!

55:59.108 --> 56:01.319
Come on, everyone! Follow me!

56:17.251 --> 56:19.212
Copper, where's Dixie?

56:19.295 --> 56:21.422
She'll be along.

56:21.506 --> 56:23.549
Cash!

56:23.633 --> 56:25.593
Way to go, Copper!

56:25.676 --> 56:28.554
- Cash, are you all right?
- No, no, are you all right? I'm...

56:28.638 --> 56:30.598
I'm fine.

56:30.681 --> 56:34.727
What in tarnation...
I thought you were in trouble.

56:38.564 --> 56:42.276
Just exactly why did you get us
all together?

56:43.277 --> 56:46.113
'Cause... 'cause...

56:46.197 --> 56:48.825
'Cause that's how it oughta be.

56:48.908 --> 56:50.910
Like the words in the song.

56:50.993 --> 56:56.791
Like the sun and blue skies. Um...

56:56.874 --> 57:00.545
Like summer nights. And fireflies.

57:01.170 --> 57:04.882
- Like an itch.
- And a scratch.

57:07.051 --> 57:10.847
Well, ain't somebody gonna sing?

58:16.412 --> 58:18.498
Gosh, I missed you.

58:50.404 --> 58:55.243
Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

58:56.410 --> 58:57.620
Whoo-hoo!

58:57.703 --> 59:02.792
Well, bravo! I finally found my act!

59:02.875 --> 59:04.377
Yahoo!

59:04.418 --> 59:07.463
You all gonna be stars!

59:11.050 --> 59:13.052
Whoo-whoo!

59:16.013 --> 59:18.015
There you fellas are!

59:18.099 --> 59:22.270
- Are these here talented canines yours?
- Yes, yes, sir.

59:22.353 --> 59:24.981
We've got to talk.
Come over here, son.

59:25.064 --> 59:29.152
Well, there you go, Cash.
You just got what you always wanted.

59:29.235 --> 59:32.196
Well, maybe I had it all along.

59:32.280 --> 59:35.825
- Well, what are you saying?
- Well, what do you think I'm saying?

59:35.908 --> 59:39.620
Well, you'd better be saying
what I think you're saying.

59:39.704 --> 59:42.999
I think you know what I'm saying is
what you think I'm saying.

59:43.082 --> 59:47.670
Well, I thought you'd never ask.

59:49.005 --> 59:52.008
Now, there's the good news.

59:52.091 --> 59:54.635
Somebody smack me.
I must be dreaming.

59:54.719 --> 59:58.139
We got a little old barn called the Grand
Old Opry I'd kinda like to show you.

59:58.181 --> 1:00:03.269
Yes, yes, sir. That sounds great.
That would be fantastic.

1:00:06.355 --> 1:00:08.274
Tod!

1:00:12.737 --> 1:00:14.530
- Tod!
- Huh?

1:00:14.614 --> 1:00:16.449
Tod!

1:00:18.117 --> 1:00:20.244
Copper?

1:00:20.328 --> 1:00:23.539
But the band... Aren't you doing with them?

1:00:23.623 --> 1:00:27.793
Can't.
You and me... we got crickets to chase.

1:00:29.587 --> 1:00:34.842
And if I ever forget that again,
you just kick me in my walkin'-awayin'.

1:00:34.884 --> 1:00:38.095
- Shake on it?
- Shake on it.

1:01:18.636 --> 1:01:19.887
Hey!

1:01:54.046 --> 1:01:56.174
Aah!

1:01:59.635 --> 1:02:01.262
Huh?

1:02:02.638 --> 1:02:05.600
- Oh!
- Wait for me!
