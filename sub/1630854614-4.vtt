01:23.879 --> 01:26.040
Welcome to the loony bin.

01:29.719 --> 01:32.439
What do you think it means,
this nightmare?

01:32.959 --> 01:34.480
I thought that was your job.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.079
No, it's pretty obvious, isn't it?

01:40.519 --> 01:41.799
I'm being held underground,

01:41.879 --> 01:44.079
tortured by the only person
who knows the truth.

01:44.879 --> 01:46.719
How did you feel down there?

01:48.319 --> 01:49.560
Wronged.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.000
Abandoned. Banished.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.120
How the hell do you think I felt?

01:57.359 --> 01:59.680
Not even my daughter
has replied to my letters.

02:00.040 --> 02:03.040
Your dream reminds me of a short story.

02:03.719 --> 02:06.359
It's about a city where everyone's happy.

02:06.439 --> 02:08.639
No one is hungry, no one is violent.

02:08.719 --> 02:10.879
They have achieved a perfect balance.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.199
But there's a catch.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.960
The system depends
on the suffering of a child,

02:15.039 --> 02:18.199
who's kept and tortured underground.
That's the pact.

02:19.039 --> 02:22.840
You remove that one child,
the entire utopia collapses.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.520
You thought
you would bring light upon the world,

02:27.039 --> 02:29.919
but you became a pariah, not a savior.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.560
Listen, doctor,

02:32.479 --> 02:35.759
I know that my pain
isn't the center of the bloody universe.

02:35.840 --> 02:39.759
But you tried to take your life.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.280
Yes, but I'm not
the one in real danger, am I?

02:42.719 --> 02:45.319
The planet is. And do you know what?

02:45.400 --> 02:46.719
I could do something about it.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.919
But they arrested me,
and then they put me in a cell.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.039
And then they stuck me
on bloody suicide watch.

02:53.639 --> 02:54.719
You know what?

02:54.800 --> 02:56.120
You can piss off!

02:56.960 --> 02:58.400
Piss off, the lot of you!

03:10.280 --> 03:11.360
You have a visitor.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.840
And who might you be?

03:28.759 --> 03:29.759
A friend.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.599
I don't do friends.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.319
An admirer.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.840
If you're one of those crackpots
that hang around

03:40.919 --> 03:43.280
looking for tortured souls to redeem,

03:43.360 --> 03:45.479
then you're in the wrong place,
sweetheart.

03:45.560 --> 03:46.919
I'm innocent.

03:49.159 --> 03:53.520
I'm not interested in whatever it is
you have done in the past, Doctor Wilde.

03:57.639 --> 04:01.560
What's ahead of us,
that's what I'm here for.

05:53.759 --> 05:55.480
Captain, do you read me? Over.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.920
Captain, do you read me? Over.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.920
It's been what? About an hour?

06:04.040 --> 06:05.399
The storm is closing in.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.800
Northerly gale 8, becoming very rough.

06:08.959 --> 06:10.040
Keep on trying!

06:11.360 --> 06:13.120
Captain, do you read me? Over.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.120
<i>Renaud, come in.</i>

06:26.519 --> 06:28.680
<i>Captain, do you read me? Over.</i>

06:32.560 --> 06:36.000
<i>Renaud, come in? Renaud--</i>

06:43.639 --> 06:44.959
Forget about them.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.600
- He's got them.
- What,

06:47.680 --> 06:49.839
- you think he killed his own brother?
- What?

06:50.480 --> 06:51.959
Do you want to go down and check?

06:56.120 --> 06:57.199
Go ahead.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.199
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

07:04.279 --> 07:06.800
This is Alexandria, Eco,
Charlie, Lima, Alpha.

07:06.879 --> 07:08.079
Mayday. Position,

07:08.160 --> 07:11.240
latitude: four-five degrees,
two-one minutes south.

07:11.319 --> 07:14.800
Longitude: one-zero-five degrees,
one-nine minutes west.

07:14.879 --> 07:16.040
I have lost my engine.

07:16.480 --> 07:19.040
I have five casualties,
including the Captain.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.000
I request immediate assistance. Mayday.

07:24.480 --> 07:25.920
Welcome to Point Nemo.

07:27.920 --> 07:31.480
<i>Mayday, Alexandria, Eco,</i>
<i>Charlie, Lima, Alpha.</i>

07:31.560 --> 07:32.879
<i>This is Nahashi Maru.</i>

07:33.519 --> 07:34.680
<i>- Received.</i>
- Thank God.

07:34.759 --> 07:37.560
<i>This is a fishing vessel.</i>
<i>We will need 18 hours to get there.</i>

07:37.879 --> 07:39.040
<i>Over.</i>

07:39.120 --> 07:41.000
Roger. We will keep our radio open.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.879
Thank you, Captain. <i>Arigato</i>.

07:42.959 --> 07:44.920
We don't have 18 hours.

07:45.439 --> 07:47.199
My samples will be dead in two!

07:47.279 --> 07:49.079
Why is there no power at the PBR room?

07:49.160 --> 07:50.120
We have power here.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.079
When the engine dies,
the emergency generator kicks in.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.959
We're in SOS mode now.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.839
Anything that's not essential
has automatically gone dark.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.839
- We need to fix it.
- Good luck with that.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.000
- I'm not sending anyone below deck.
- Listen to me!

08:02.079 --> 08:03.519
No, you listen to me.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.480
I'm the commanding officer of this ship.

08:05.560 --> 08:09.079
My duty is to the crew and the vessel,
not to your research.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.319
Do you have any idea what's at stake here?

08:13.240 --> 08:14.800
Do what you want with your lot.

08:15.199 --> 08:17.040
But my crew is staying put.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.839
And that's an order.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.759
Alright.

08:25.519 --> 08:26.639
Come on.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.279
Come on.

08:31.759 --> 08:33.480
You finally got what you wanted, huh?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.320
What are you talking about?

08:37.440 --> 08:38.559
The ship is yours.

08:39.039 --> 08:40.240
You're in charge now.

08:41.440 --> 08:42.639
Congratulations.

08:52.679 --> 08:55.360
Well, so the ship is a 145 meters long.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.360
Can anyone find the goddamn generator?

08:57.440 --> 08:58.799
Hold on. Let me have a look.

08:59.519 --> 09:00.639
Let's turn it round.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.240
That's it.

09:03.519 --> 09:05.519
- It must be here.
- Let me see.

09:06.759 --> 09:08.799
Yeah, that's it. Emergency generator.

09:08.879 --> 09:11.200
That's all the way down the prow,
level three.

09:11.279 --> 09:13.960
I'm sorry, but what's the plan?
Say we manage to get there.

09:14.639 --> 09:16.639
Can we reconfigure
the generator somehow?

09:16.720 --> 09:18.519
Well, we rewire it manually.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.720
Are you crazy? That's too far.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.240
I don't think
we even have enough wire for that.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.399
We do.

09:25.559 --> 09:27.000
What did you say?

09:27.080 --> 09:29.840
- We're talking about 120 meters, right?
- Yeah.

09:29.919 --> 09:32.440
We have enough cables.
I can show you where we keep them.

09:32.759 --> 09:33.759
Thank you.

09:34.799 --> 09:36.159
I'm gonna need someone with me.

09:38.639 --> 09:41.080
- Well, what about Charlie?
- Charlie doesn't have a gun.

09:42.279 --> 09:44.279
I'm sorry, I'm not risking my life.

09:46.159 --> 09:47.320
I'm just the cook.

09:48.279 --> 09:50.039
- How much?
- What?

09:50.120 --> 09:52.039
- You. How much?
- What do you mean?

09:52.399 --> 09:54.919
How much? Hundred thousand dollars?
Two hundred thousand?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.559
- I'm on your side, but I'm not going
down. - Come on, how much?

09:57.639 --> 09:59.080
- Arthur, stop.
- Half a million.

10:01.159 --> 10:02.440
Take it or leave it.

10:09.320 --> 10:10.320
Half a million.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.320
US dollars.

10:14.519 --> 10:15.720
You have my word.

10:17.240 --> 10:18.320
Come on.

10:35.399 --> 10:37.399
Oxygen is at 68%.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.919
It's decaying much faster
than you anticipated.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.759
Well, at least, the air compressors
will help give us a bit more time.

10:42.840 --> 10:43.919
Yeah, but not much.

10:50.039 --> 10:52.279
- You better come back in one piece, okay?
- Yeah.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.559
We'll be listening.

10:57.960 --> 10:58.960
Great.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.320
- This is totally useless now.
- Is it though?

11:19.320 --> 11:20.320
It certainly is.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.320
I mean, I don't know.

11:22.399 --> 11:23.960
The compressor still looks intact.

11:24.879 --> 11:25.960
Unless...

11:27.080 --> 11:28.080
What?

11:28.759 --> 11:31.279
Maybe we could salvage some of the parts

11:31.960 --> 11:34.080
and construct something
that we could carry with us

11:34.159 --> 11:35.399
when the Japs come.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.039
Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.

11:38.919 --> 11:40.799
Get Yuto and Gloria to help you.

11:41.759 --> 11:42.879
Arthur, look,

11:42.960 --> 11:45.279
Oscar couldn't have tried
to steal our research on his own.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.120
Are you sure
you want more people involved?

11:49.039 --> 11:51.679
And how the hell am I going to keep
an eye on you, sweetheart,

11:52.000 --> 11:54.279
if I don't have other people involved?

12:00.720 --> 12:01.840
Are you ready, Wan?

12:05.200 --> 12:06.279
Alright.

12:07.559 --> 12:08.879
Now or never, right?

14:00.480 --> 14:01.559
Excuse me?

14:03.919 --> 14:06.120
I'm sorry. Are you alright?

14:07.320 --> 14:08.600
Can I help you?

14:09.679 --> 14:10.840
I don't think you can.

14:12.159 --> 14:14.519
You're hurt. What happened?

14:16.799 --> 14:17.799
I...

14:18.759 --> 14:20.039
My boyfriend, he...

14:20.679 --> 14:21.720
Fuck.

14:25.399 --> 14:26.759
Do you know a Rachel Russo?

14:26.840 --> 14:28.600
She lives in this building and...

14:29.320 --> 14:31.440
And she's the only family
I've got in Dublin, so...

14:31.519 --> 14:34.000
You're family with Rachel?
I'm... I'm her flatmate.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.440
- You're Liam?
- Yeah.

14:37.759 --> 14:40.399
I'm Anna, her cousin from London.

14:41.559 --> 14:43.840
I'm sorry.
I don't think she's ever mentioned you.

14:43.919 --> 14:45.120
Great.

14:47.159 --> 14:49.360
Well, my battery is dead
from trying to call her,

14:49.440 --> 14:51.440
it's like she's on another planet
or something.

14:51.519 --> 14:53.480
She's on a business trip.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.120
Okay, fuck.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.240
No, wait.

14:59.919 --> 15:01.559
Come inside.
Let me have a look at that.

15:01.879 --> 15:03.600
- You sure?
- Of course.

15:05.759 --> 15:06.759
Thank you.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.559
- Since when do we have a second PBR?
- Good question.

15:11.639 --> 15:13.799
Can you make
a smaller one out of it or not?

15:14.679 --> 15:16.960
- I don't even know what this is.
- You?

15:18.399 --> 15:21.799
Maybe I can,
but I'm gonna need your 3D printer.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.679
I hate to break it to you,

15:50.519 --> 15:53.440
but if you think you can retire
with half a million in the piggy,

15:53.960 --> 15:56.799
- you can't.
- Retire? No.

15:56.879 --> 15:58.840
With that money,
I'll buy my own restaurant.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.679
I'll become a chef.

16:01.399 --> 16:03.000
Top crew, top produce.

16:03.519 --> 16:05.320
Is that what you're risking your neck for?

16:05.399 --> 16:06.480
I love to cook.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.440
What I hate is this ship.

16:09.159 --> 16:11.639
20 years of this hell is enough.

16:13.159 --> 16:14.519
Come on.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.120
Third cable in. Halfway there.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.919
You were right,
someone is trying to steal the research.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.080
- It has to be one of the scientists.
- How?

16:26.480 --> 16:28.440
Since when do we have access
to the containers?

16:29.399 --> 16:31.159
You know what really bugs me?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.639
- What?
- The killings only began

16:32.720 --> 16:33.919
after the breakthrough.

16:34.600 --> 16:38.639
First Kowalski, then Zach, then Rachel...
It's like they got what they wanted,

16:39.080 --> 16:41.320
now they're just getting rid
of all the witnesses. Us.

16:41.399 --> 16:43.200
You think
they had it planned from the start?

16:43.559 --> 16:45.519
I don't know. I mean, think about it:

16:45.600 --> 16:48.320
no communications,
all the secrecy to come on board.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.120
Nobody knows we're here!

16:57.639 --> 17:00.360
-If you're the killer...
- What? I'm not the killer!

17:00.440 --> 17:02.519
- What is...?
- Yuto, please.

17:03.039 --> 17:04.160
Just let me speak, okay?

17:04.960 --> 17:07.920
If you're the killer,
could you just, please, do it fast?

17:08.279 --> 17:10.160
Like, shoot me in the head kind of thing.

17:10.519 --> 17:12.200
Because honestly,
death doesn't scare me,

17:12.279 --> 17:14.400
but I just don't wanna suffer,
could you do that?

17:16.480 --> 17:19.079
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.839
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.559
Is that Kowalski's laptop?

17:28.920 --> 17:30.279
It worked!

18:32.680 --> 18:33.799
We're there.

18:36.839 --> 18:38.400
Oh, shit!

18:38.480 --> 18:39.480
Wan!

18:42.880 --> 18:44.319
Wan!

18:50.240 --> 18:51.279
Charlie!

19:03.880 --> 19:04.880
Charlie!

19:05.759 --> 19:06.920
No!

19:10.519 --> 19:12.039
Charlie! No!

19:12.119 --> 19:13.319
Stop!

19:18.480 --> 19:20.079
Help, help!

19:20.160 --> 19:21.839
<i>He got Alec! Charlie got Alec!</i>

19:21.920 --> 19:22.839
Wan, what was that?

19:23.759 --> 19:26.319
Wan, what did you say?
Charlie got Alec, is that what you heard?

19:26.400 --> 19:27.359
- Wan?
- Shit!

19:28.480 --> 19:32.680
Alec, Alec, do you copy? Alec?

19:39.720 --> 19:40.759
Fuck.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.400
Put him down.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.440
I said put him down!

20:06.039 --> 20:07.400
Sorry.

20:12.119 --> 20:13.319
Mister Wan.

20:14.720 --> 20:15.920
Yes. It's me, mister Wan.

20:20.279 --> 20:21.519
Mister Wan.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.720
No, Char--

20:59.960 --> 21:00.960
<i>Alec, are you ok?</i>

21:01.960 --> 21:03.160
<i>Alec, talk to me!</i>

21:13.799 --> 21:15.960
You! Send him down! Now!

21:16.440 --> 21:17.640
What the hell is going on?

21:17.720 --> 21:20.079
Alec and Wan
are trying to reach the generators,

21:20.160 --> 21:22.920
but Charlie has got in their way.
I need you down there!

21:23.000 --> 21:24.240
- Now!
- Wait, what the hell

21:24.319 --> 21:26.440
- was Wan doing down there?
- He agreed to go.

21:27.799 --> 21:29.119
For a compensation.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.440
- You fucking bastard.
- How much?

21:31.519 --> 21:33.480
- Don't you dare.
- A hundred grand.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.640
Enough! This is not happening!

21:37.519 --> 21:38.920
It's now or never, son.

21:41.759 --> 21:42.880
Wil.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.440
Don't.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.240
Okay. I'll do it.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.759
- Fuck!
- But I want your gun.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.160
What gun?

22:03.519 --> 22:04.640
<i>I'm coming down.</i>

22:06.400 --> 22:07.559
<i>Alec.</i>

22:10.119 --> 22:11.200
<i>Come through.</i>

22:12.680 --> 22:14.599
I'm on level 2, I'm following the cables.

22:21.480 --> 22:22.599
Alec, do you copy?

22:23.319 --> 22:26.519
Rachel, get your ass up here now!

22:28.680 --> 22:30.519
<i>No! Someone needs to go to the generator</i>

22:30.599 --> 22:33.119
<i>and my life is worth just as much</i>
<i>as anyone else's on the ship.</i>

22:33.200 --> 22:34.720
Rachel, please, no!

22:39.200 --> 22:41.240
<i>We have to save the research.</i>

22:42.200 --> 22:44.240
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but you're right.

22:44.720 --> 22:45.960
This is bigger than us.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.279
<i>It's not worth it, Rachel.</i>

22:48.880 --> 22:51.920
Dad, how can you say that
after everything you've been through?

22:53.079 --> 22:55.799
Rachel, Rachel, please, no.

22:58.119 --> 22:59.599
You said that you trusted me.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.759
I do.

23:09.200 --> 23:10.720
<i>Then let me do this.</i>

23:51.920 --> 23:54.559
No, no, no. Fuck.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.400
Kowalski was working on this.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.160
Wait.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.599
That's not the same molecule
that Arthur is working with?

24:04.680 --> 24:08.160
But look, the file was created
the same day he was killed.

24:09.319 --> 24:11.960
He must have been working on this
while we were celebrating.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.640
This could be the reason he was killed.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.200
I'll go find Arthur. He needs to know.

24:18.279 --> 24:19.599
- Hey.
- Yeah?

24:20.680 --> 24:23.000
- Be careful.
- Sure.

25:05.680 --> 25:06.640
Alec!

25:07.160 --> 25:08.359
Hey!

25:08.880 --> 25:10.519
Alec! Alec!

25:43.640 --> 25:46.519
- Do you want a coffee or something?
- I... Yeah. That'd be nice.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.440
So, what's going on with Rachel?

25:50.519 --> 25:52.400
I was hoping you could answer that.

25:53.279 --> 25:54.400
I don't know much.

25:54.480 --> 25:57.079
Last I saw her was like three months ago.

25:58.720 --> 25:59.839
She was in the Philippines,

25:59.920 --> 26:02.480
doing her thing
with the sea stars and free diving.

26:02.559 --> 26:03.799
- Right.
- But...

26:03.880 --> 26:05.720
Well, she said she'd be back by now.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.880
Yeah, I mean,
the whole thing is a bit weird.

26:09.599 --> 26:11.880
The Philippines was her passion project

26:12.400 --> 26:15.920
and she just dropped it like a hot brick.

26:16.640 --> 26:17.759
Did she say why?

26:17.839 --> 26:19.559
She said
she couldn't go into any details.

26:19.640 --> 26:20.680
But then...

26:21.799 --> 26:23.839
I mean,
you know about her father, right?

26:26.119 --> 26:27.480
Yeah, that was something.

26:29.079 --> 26:30.119
Yeah.

26:31.319 --> 26:34.839
She never spoke about him.
Like, never.

26:36.599 --> 26:38.599
Did you ever meet him?

26:39.640 --> 26:40.759
Arthur?

26:41.640 --> 26:43.079
Yeah. Once. A long time ago.

26:43.839 --> 26:45.200
Do you think she's with him?

26:47.559 --> 26:49.039
You tell me.

26:49.119 --> 26:50.759
I'm starting to worry, it's...

26:52.079 --> 26:53.839
It's not like her to be impulsive.

26:57.279 --> 26:58.640
Look.

26:59.759 --> 27:01.640
There's something I haven't told anyone.

27:02.400 --> 27:07.240
But the last text that she sent
was just her saying goodbye,

27:07.319 --> 27:11.680
and then a selfie on a port,

27:12.759 --> 27:14.240
by a massive ship.

27:15.839 --> 27:18.240
- That's a Chilean flag, isn't it?
- Chile?

27:18.319 --> 27:20.119
What the fuck is she doing in Chile?

27:26.279 --> 27:28.200
You know what?
Maybe we shouldn't speculate.

27:29.200 --> 27:32.039
I'm sorry. I have work to do.

27:32.359 --> 27:34.240
It's okay. I'll go.

27:35.799 --> 27:38.160
Could I just use your bathroom quickly?

27:38.240 --> 27:41.480
- Yeah, it's second on the right.
- Okay.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.160
Arthur? It's me.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.960
<i>Can anyone tell me if it's working?</i>

29:50.519 --> 29:52.519
No. It's nothing, Rachel, nothing.

29:58.880 --> 29:59.880
<i>Try again.</i>

30:00.519 --> 30:03.240
Rachel, I'm standing beside it,
it's not working.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.640
<i>Okay, let's try something else.</i>

30:16.039 --> 30:18.960
Wait, the power's back, Rachel.
The power's back.

30:19.039 --> 30:21.640
You hear me? The power's back, well done.
Come back now!

30:22.279 --> 30:23.440
Okay.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.519
Oxygen levels are rising.

30:34.039 --> 30:35.119
It's coming back up.

30:48.039 --> 30:49.319
Hey, Charlie.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.640
What are you doing here?

30:57.519 --> 30:58.759
It doesn't matter.

31:03.319 --> 31:05.319
Okay, I need to rewire the generator.

31:08.319 --> 31:09.559
- Why?
- To...

31:09.640 --> 31:12.160
To get the PBR machine running again.

31:13.839 --> 31:15.920
- PBR?
- Yeah, it's a tank.

31:16.720 --> 31:18.319
With a light. Do...

31:18.400 --> 31:21.839
Do you remember when we were in the lab,
with the...? With the light. It...

31:22.599 --> 31:25.079
- Yeah.
- It's that, it grows algae.

31:25.519 --> 31:29.079
- Algae?
- It's really, really important.

31:29.160 --> 31:32.039
We could save...
Save millions of lives with it.

31:36.839 --> 31:39.200
- Saving lives with algae?
- Yeah.

31:40.519 --> 31:42.759
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- No, no.

31:42.839 --> 31:44.440
No, it's what we're trying to do.

31:44.519 --> 31:46.720
- You've heard about Climate Change...
- You're lying.

31:46.799 --> 31:50.160
- I'm... I'm not.
- Why are you lying to me?

31:50.799 --> 31:53.359
- I'm not lying.
- You are so!

31:53.440 --> 31:55.559
I know... I know where Blanda is.

31:59.359 --> 32:01.039
- Where is she?
- She's safe.

32:01.519 --> 32:03.319
- Where is she?
- She's... She's safe.

32:04.880 --> 32:05.839
She's safe.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.079
She's safe.

32:09.039 --> 32:10.839
She's my only friend now.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.519
- No, Charlie.
- I don't have friends.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.279
No. No, I'm...

32:16.920 --> 32:19.480
-I'm your friend.
- Are you?

32:19.559 --> 32:20.920
I'm your friend too.

32:21.359 --> 32:23.920
A friend who wants to lock me up.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.559
No, Charlie...

32:35.480 --> 32:37.480
Charlie. Let her go.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.440
Alec, don't.

32:45.039 --> 32:46.799
Alec, please, don't kill him.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.119
Run!

32:54.319 --> 32:55.880
- Let's go.
- Are you okay?

32:57.799 --> 32:59.240
<i>Someone open the door.</i>

33:00.319 --> 33:01.640
Come on. Come on!

33:01.960 --> 33:03.319
Quick! Quick!

33:08.119 --> 33:09.160
Seal it!

33:13.720 --> 33:14.680
Let's go.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.440
There's many other ways for him
to come out of there.

33:32.519 --> 33:34.119
I thought I was going to lose you.

35:06.360 --> 35:07.440
<i>"Dear Rachel.</i>

35:08.199 --> 35:10.880
<i>Once again, I write to you,</i>
<i>in the hope that you'll reply,</i>

35:11.599 --> 35:14.119
<i>even if it is to tell me</i>
<i>never to write you again.</i>

35:15.320 --> 35:16.320
<i>I'm done.</i>

35:16.880 --> 35:18.920
<i>Done with power wielded for nothing.</i>

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
<i>Done with inertia and stupidity.</i>

35:22.840 --> 35:25.840
<i>I'm done with waiting</i>
<i>when there's so much work to do.</i>

35:26.320 --> 35:29.039
<i>I have gotten in touch</i>
<i>with the dark parts of me,</i>

35:29.119 --> 35:31.199
<i>parts that have been long dormant.</i>

35:31.880 --> 35:34.840
<i>I've found a way</i>
<i>to turn everything on its head.</i>

35:35.400 --> 35:37.639
<i>I mean everything."</i>

35:49.920 --> 35:51.559
I knew I'd seen your face somewhere.

35:54.440 --> 35:56.039
Don't try anything.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.639
The Garda are on their way.

36:00.199 --> 36:02.000
I swear to God.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.119
Don't swear to God.

36:06.039 --> 36:07.719
God has nothing to do with this.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.320
What the hell are you doing here?

36:16.800 --> 36:17.840
What's this?

36:21.920 --> 36:23.039
Just a molecule.

36:25.719 --> 36:26.840
What molecule?

36:30.079 --> 36:31.159
A molecule.

36:34.440 --> 36:35.639
You don't wanna do this.

36:37.559 --> 36:39.079
You don't have it in you.

36:41.639 --> 36:43.840
You see, pulling the trigger,
that's the easy part.

36:47.360 --> 36:50.000
But the people you kill,
they stay with you forever.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.800
And that's the hard part.

36:54.960 --> 36:59.000
So you've got to have a really good reason
for taking someone's life.

37:00.119 --> 37:01.480
And you just don't,

37:03.559 --> 37:04.679
do you?

37:13.719 --> 37:15.119
The photo. I want to see it.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.679
- What?
- The one Rachel sent you.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.440
What do you want with Rachel?

37:48.800 --> 37:49.880
It was you.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.480
You killed Kowalski!

37:55.079 --> 37:56.239
No.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.639
No, wait, Gloria, no, wait, I can explain.

38:04.039 --> 38:05.719
Wait, I can explain.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.639
No, wait. Wait, Gloria.

38:07.719 --> 38:11.079
No. No, wait! Wait!
Let me explain, Gloria!

38:13.119 --> 38:15.280
Gloria, this is infantile.

38:15.360 --> 38:16.480
Infantile!

38:18.000 --> 38:19.440
Gloria.

38:19.519 --> 38:21.639
Come on,
you're smarter than this, Gloria.

38:22.920 --> 38:24.000
Come on, Gloria.

38:25.320 --> 38:26.639
Open the door!

38:27.719 --> 38:30.039
Gloria, come out and we'll discuss it.

38:31.159 --> 38:33.840
Come on, Gloria. Come on.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.719
- Help!
- Open the door!

38:37.039 --> 38:38.880
Help!

39:25.400 --> 39:26.719
<i>We've got her.</i>

39:26.800 --> 39:27.880
Good.

39:29.920 --> 39:31.039
Bring her here.
