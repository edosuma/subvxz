00:01.535 --> 00:04.903
How was yoga?
You have good stretch?

00:04.905 --> 00:06.472
Yoga's more than
just stretching.

00:06.474 --> 00:09.441
It's lengthening,
opening, extending...

00:09.443 --> 00:11.944
Hmm. Sounds like you just
stretching what I say.

00:11.946 --> 00:13.612
(both chuckle)

00:13.614 --> 00:14.747
<i>Namaste,</i> Mr. Kim.

00:14.749 --> 00:17.049
- You have a <i>namaste,</i> too.
- (chuckles)

00:17.051 --> 00:18.584
Oh! Don't forget
your water bottle.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.119
Thanks.

00:22.790 --> 00:23.989
I don't get that.

00:23.991 --> 00:25.457
I thought your people
invented yoga.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.293
Not yoga, though I am
surprisingly supple.

00:28.295 --> 00:29.928
I mean the ridiculous
water bottles.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.363
Yah, I know.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.199
Everybody sip water
like their life depend on.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.601
When I was growing up,

00:35.603 --> 00:37.636
We certainly didn't drink
from sterile canisters

00:37.638 --> 00:38.704
Crafted by hippies.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.205
Yah. I had to go to well.

00:40.207 --> 00:44.143
We drank from anywhere.
Streams, ponds, puddles.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.811
For me, only well.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.046
Sure, some died,

00:47.048 --> 00:48.914
But those who didn't
grew stronger.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.716
But kids are different
now, huh.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.684
All they do is look at phone
and go to washroom.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.788
All because of stupid,
beautiful water bottles.

00:55.790 --> 00:57.523
My god, these are salty!

00:57.525 --> 00:59.625
- I can't feel my tongue.
- Huh.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.894
I think there's
a puddle outside.

01:01.896 --> 01:04.029
I'll take an Evian.

01:04.031 --> 01:06.298
(theme music playing)

01:26.020 --> 01:27.386
And everything was
okay with the van?

01:27.388 --> 01:28.554
Oh, yah.

01:28.556 --> 01:32.491
Also it smell like cigarette
before we get.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.726
(chuckles) well,
I'm glad the choir had fun.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.728
I'll go get Jung
and he can finish up.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.497
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.933
(sighs)

01:40.935 --> 01:42.367
- Shannon: Hey there, mom.
- (gasps)

01:42.369 --> 01:43.602
What?

01:43.604 --> 01:46.305
Shannon: Heard the church
field trip was amazing.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.107
Ms. Shannon, what you doing?

01:48.109 --> 01:50.075
Shannon: Shannon's
not here right now.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.578
It's just me, your son, Jung.

01:52.580 --> 01:55.080
Looks just like him.

01:55.082 --> 01:56.515
Isn't it great? (chuckles)

01:56.517 --> 01:59.318
Handy used Jung as a model
for its hiring campaign.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.887
We're hoping to reach
all different kinds of people.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.155
Oh. Different how?

02:03.157 --> 02:05.090
Oh, well, not different,
just diverse.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.459
A wide range
of backgrounds, culturally.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.895
- Too many white people?
- Essentially, yes.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.396
Mmm.

02:11.398 --> 02:13.065
Oh!

02:13.067 --> 02:16.168
Jung.
Not in front of your mother.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.036
(chuckles nervously) uh...

02:18.038 --> 02:19.171
Just joking.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.606
- Ah...
- (chuckles)

02:22.009 --> 02:23.642
Yeah, you hit the floor
every time.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.843
You know what?

02:24.845 --> 02:27.112
I've thrown a lot of rags
on a lot of hooks.

02:27.114 --> 02:28.480
So what time's
NaYoung getting in?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.149
We're picking her up
after this.

02:31.085 --> 02:32.918
Ready?

02:32.920 --> 02:34.786
Uh, not ready for that.

02:34.788 --> 02:35.988
They don't have wallet-size?

02:35.990 --> 02:37.122
Isn't it hilarious?

02:37.124 --> 02:38.790
It's so nice a picture of you.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.092
Yeah, it's okay.

02:40.094 --> 02:41.493
Bit of double chin.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.462
It's a shadow.

02:43.464 --> 02:46.331
Uh, Janet.
I go put Jung in minivan.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.169
I hope you find someone

02:50.171 --> 02:51.436
Who loves you
as much as you love you.

02:51.438 --> 02:53.372
- Ha-ha.
- I call him perfect Jung.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.174
Because he doesn't talk
or take off his shirt?

02:55.176 --> 02:56.909
He doesn't take three hours
in the bathroom.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.477
Your hate just makes me
more beautiful.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.045
I can't believe you didn't
keep one for yourself.

03:00.047 --> 03:01.580
Are you kidding?
We've got five at our place.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.881
- (car horn honking)
- one's a spare.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.183
<i>Oppa,</i> I want one.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.450
What are you going to do

03:05.452 --> 03:06.852
With a life-size
cardboard cutout of me?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.153
But when I ask
you that question,

03:08.155 --> 03:09.521
- I'm "picking a fight"?
- (car horn honks)

03:09.523 --> 03:11.023
Okay!

03:11.025 --> 03:13.225
Please keep this going.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.164
(sighs)

03:25.539 --> 03:26.605
(gasps)

03:29.877 --> 03:31.510
What is that?

03:36.684 --> 03:38.217
(both speaking Korean)

03:39.486 --> 03:40.786
What's this?

03:40.788 --> 03:42.154
Oh, that's Jung.

03:42.156 --> 03:44.957
They have at handy,
for diversity hiring.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.225
Hmm?

03:46.227 --> 03:48.727
If you don't like,
we can throw out.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.529
No.

03:50.531 --> 03:53.799
- If you like we can keep.
- Yah?

03:53.801 --> 03:55.067
Hmm.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.035
Jung really this tall?

03:57.037 --> 03:59.571
Yah. Is life-size.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.874
Hmm. Maybe he wearing shoes
with a big heel.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.243
Okay, I'm going to wholesale.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.511
- Back soon.
- Okay. See you.

04:09.283 --> 04:12.484
Just a picture of a man.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.423
(scoffs)

04:18.959 --> 04:20.459
(inhales deeply)

04:33.440 --> 04:34.506
(sighs)

04:40.914 --> 04:42.180
(sighs)

04:46.453 --> 04:47.719
Be right back.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.935
<i>Eonni,</i> you apartment is so...

05:03.937 --> 05:05.003
I know, nice, huh?

05:05.005 --> 05:06.905
- I mean so...
- Funky?

05:06.907 --> 05:09.541
More different.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.709
It's nice though, right?

05:11.245 --> 05:12.411
No.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.547
Oh!

05:15.549 --> 05:17.416
I almost forget!

05:18.786 --> 05:19.951
Present for you.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.086
Oh, paper.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.254
- Yay!
- No, letters.

05:22.256 --> 05:24.389
You write to me
when we is little.

05:24.391 --> 05:26.058
I can't believe
you kept these.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.193
It's how I practice
my English.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.995
Hey, NaYoung.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.463
Oh, Gerald-ah!

05:32.132 --> 05:33.198
(chuckles)

05:33.200 --> 05:34.800
Uh, how's Waterloo?

05:34.802 --> 05:36.435
Oh, so much work.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.671
I like you shirt. It's new?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.006
Oh. Uh...

05:41.008 --> 05:42.441
No. I work at
the bulk boutique tonight.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.543
So, I mean,
if either of you ladies

05:44.545 --> 05:46.611
Are in the market
for some cardamom pods...

05:46.613 --> 05:47.813
- We're not.
- Okay.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.281
Well, let me know
where you're going later.

05:49.283 --> 05:50.849
- Maybe I can join?
- (gasps)

05:50.851 --> 05:53.085
(stammers) I can join.
I can definitely join.

05:53.087 --> 05:55.454
Yes! So fun!

05:55.456 --> 05:57.422
Oh, and Gerald said
you could use his room.

05:57.424 --> 05:58.790
Yeah, I even topped up
the waterbed

05:58.792 --> 06:00.959
So it's, uh, ready for
your snooze cruise.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.260
Okay, thanks "Gerald-ah."

06:02.262 --> 06:03.528
Yeah, your only ports of call

06:03.530 --> 06:06.565
Will be dreamville
and slumber city.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.635
Um... Uh, bon voyage.

06:13.207 --> 06:16.575
So, what we doing tonight?

06:16.577 --> 06:18.443
Um, Jung and Kimchee
are coming over for drinks

06:18.445 --> 06:20.612
And then I thought
we could hit a club.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.614
The night is "NaYoung."

06:22.616 --> 06:24.049
(laughing)

06:24.051 --> 06:26.017
Kimchee's coming, too?

06:26.019 --> 06:28.086
Yeah, you remember Kimchee?

06:28.088 --> 06:31.656
<i>Eonni</i> have to read!
Oh, is so funny.

06:33.794 --> 06:38.330
"I think maybe my boob
is getting smaller."

06:38.332 --> 06:40.665
Covered a lot of
ground back then.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.601
(gasps) here it is!

06:42.603 --> 06:46.238
"Today Kimchee gave me
such a big smile.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.574
"I thought my whole heart
was going to melt."

06:49.576 --> 06:53.044
- What?
- "he is so tall and gorgeous.

06:53.046 --> 06:56.248
"And he has
the cutest little earlobes."

06:56.250 --> 06:57.783
Uh, can I see that?

06:57.785 --> 07:02.154
Look, you draw picture
of you and Kimchee kissing.

07:02.156 --> 07:03.789
Wow. We're really going at it.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.591
It's true love.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.727
I had a crush on
a lot of Jung's friends.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.162
Don't be embarrass.

07:10.164 --> 07:12.597
Kimchee very sweet.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.266
You could do worse.

07:14.268 --> 07:17.135
And maybe not better?

07:20.007 --> 07:21.273
(door opens)

07:21.942 --> 07:23.275
Excuse me,

07:23.277 --> 07:26.011
My son has something
he'd like to say to you.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.146
Hmm. What is?
You looking for job?

07:28.148 --> 07:30.682
Uh, not quite. Ephram.

07:32.419 --> 07:34.753
I took this from your store.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.755
Hmm. Hmm.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.056
Steal, hmm?

07:39.026 --> 07:40.692
Very serious.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.564
I'm sorry.

07:46.834 --> 07:50.735
It's easy to steal,
but very hard to say sorry.

07:50.737 --> 07:51.970
I forgive you,

07:51.972 --> 07:55.040
- But don't steal again, hmm?
- Okay.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.742
Obviously, you've got kids.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.110
Yah. Two.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.313
See, you got lucky
this time, buddy.

08:01.315 --> 08:04.115
- Anything else?
- Can we get some candy?

08:04.117 --> 08:07.219
What? No. Let's go.
Thanks so much.

08:07.221 --> 08:08.587
But I did the right thing.

08:08.589 --> 08:11.022
Yeah, because I made you.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.230
(exclaims in disgust)

08:22.736 --> 08:24.002
Yeesh.

08:27.774 --> 08:30.442
- Hi.
- Hmm. Hi.

08:31.345 --> 08:34.045
- So, he's still here.
- Yah.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.881
He not grow leg and walk away.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.082
He has leg.

08:37.084 --> 08:40.018
He still not walk,
and no one move.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.121
I not move, you not move,
so no problem.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.023
Okay.

08:45.526 --> 08:46.725
Okay.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.762
Jung look short.
You cut down his shoes?

08:50.764 --> 08:52.964
No, it's life-size.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.232
Oh.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.272
He is rock star.

09:00.274 --> 09:02.374
- Uh, Bono!
- Uh, like a rolling stone.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.242
- The rolling stones.
- No, but one guy.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.978
- A Nobel prize winner.
- Albert Einstein!

09:06.980 --> 09:08.013
(chuckling)

09:08.015 --> 09:09.114
Uh...

09:09.116 --> 09:10.615
Janet loves you!

09:10.617 --> 09:11.716
No, I don't.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.184
- Yes, you do.
- No.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.687
- What, you love bob Dylan.
- Bob Dylan!

09:15.689 --> 09:17.255
- Yes!
- Yeah!

09:17.257 --> 09:20.992
Yes, I used to like bob Dylan.
A long, long time ago.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.261
Okay.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.930
Who wants more drink?

09:24.932 --> 09:27.032
- Bob Dylan.
- I'll help.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.236
What's this?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.304
Huh.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.739
That's Janet's handwriting.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.477
(whispers) oh, snap.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.413
David Ko tried to
kiss her at church

09:41.415 --> 09:43.048
And she kicked him
in the nuts.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.550
I remember that. He was on the
floor for, like, 20 minutes.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.252
(laughs) she brought
him an ice pack

09:47.254 --> 09:48.987
And he tried
to kiss her again.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.589
(both laughing)

09:50.591 --> 09:52.023
My boy doesn't learn.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.161
- Janet. Those are hilarious.
- Oh, no.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.462
Kimchee: Uh,
I admire your passion,

09:57.464 --> 09:59.030
But there's
gotta be a better way

09:59.032 --> 10:00.398
For you to tell
a guy how you feel.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.067
(chuckles nervously)
it was just a crush.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.668
This is why
I didn't want you to know.

10:03.670 --> 10:06.371
I knew you'd make
a big deal of it.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.806
What are you talking about?

10:07.808 --> 10:10.275
Hmm? I don't know.
What are you talking about?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.477
David Ko, you kicked him
in the nuts at church.

10:12.813 --> 10:13.912
Oh!

10:13.914 --> 10:15.947
Right. I did.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.049
Okay, so who's next?

10:18.051 --> 10:20.919
Back up. Why would
I make a deal out of it?

10:20.921 --> 10:22.287
Someone got a crush on me?

10:23.056 --> 10:25.824
Okay, it's... NaYoung.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.025
I knew it.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.393
Really?

10:28.395 --> 10:29.961
Why you gotta
say it like that?

10:29.963 --> 10:33.765
I got the hair, the shoes,
sophistication up the butt.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.033
It's so not a big deal.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.601
She's probably
over it already, and...

10:36.603 --> 10:38.069
(whispers) I promised
not to say anything,

10:38.071 --> 10:39.638
So just let it go, okay?

10:39.640 --> 10:41.706
Yeah, you don't want to end up
like David Ko.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.942
Why? I heard he
just bought a cottage.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.343
Sweet.

10:47.447 --> 10:51.916
He look so good,
I almost forget Jung is fake.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.585
Superficial maybe,
but not fake.

10:53.587 --> 10:56.087
No. Cardboard Jung,
downstairs.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.789
Oh, right.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.290
Appa is take care now.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.093
Always dusting him,
like real son.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.595
I never dusted my son.

11:03.597 --> 11:05.630
I think this help.

11:05.632 --> 11:08.033
Baby step.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.068
How long has it
been since he left?

11:10.904 --> 11:12.804
Almost nine year now.

11:12.806 --> 11:15.473
When Jung was little,
Appa love him so much.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.475
Used to take him to playground
all the time.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.978
Well, Jung is the first fruit
of his loins.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.580
Yeah, but then
the teenage year.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.349
Jung always
getting in trouble.

11:24.351 --> 11:28.219
One day,
police bring Jung home.

11:28.221 --> 11:31.022
After that, Jung and Appa
have a big fight.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.091
Jung run away.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.093
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.929
Mr. Mehta doesn't talk
to Shibani, our daughter.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.597
Men can be so prideful.

11:39.599 --> 11:42.600
Maybe you should get
cutout of your daughter.

11:42.602 --> 11:45.403
Maybe I get cutout
of Mr. Mehta.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.611
Hey.

11:53.613 --> 11:54.846
(yawning) how was it?

11:54.848 --> 11:57.816
Uh, a little crazy but fun.

11:57.818 --> 12:00.085
Oh, sorry. I didn't see
your text till after.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.653
It's okay.
I wasn't feeling great.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.321
(cell phone chimes)

12:03.323 --> 12:05.423
Two pounds of yogurt pretzels
is a lot to eat in one shift.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.825
Mmm.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.961
Oh, crap. We're supposed to be
at brunch in half an hour.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.763
You're welcome to come.

12:11.765 --> 12:15.433
Sure, I could eat.
Just not yogurt pretzels.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.835
Hey, it's 11:30.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.703
Brunch is at noon.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.705
NaYoung?

12:26.646 --> 12:28.246
She's not here.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.949
You mean,
I slept out here for nothing?

12:30.951 --> 12:32.083
(sighs)

12:32.085 --> 12:33.585
(cell phone ringing)

12:37.524 --> 12:38.790
(sighs)

12:38.792 --> 12:39.991
What?

12:39.993 --> 12:41.025
NaYoung didn't
come home last night.

12:41.027 --> 12:42.460
I thought she left with you.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.562
Oh, I met someone
and we were kind of vibin'.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.297
So you don't know
what happened to her?

12:46.299 --> 12:48.466
She was with Kimchee.
I'm sure it's fine.

12:48.468 --> 12:51.069
<i>- I'm just worried.</i>
- (sighs)

12:51.071 --> 12:53.138
All right, I'll ask.

12:54.608 --> 12:55.907
<i>It's NaYoung.</i>

12:55.909 --> 12:59.310
She's probably just out
taking selfies with strangers.

12:59.846 --> 13:00.879
(knocks)

13:00.881 --> 13:03.281
Hey, Kimch. Have you seen...

13:03.283 --> 13:04.716
Whoa.

13:04.718 --> 13:06.551
Did you see her?

13:06.553 --> 13:09.687
Little bit of her,
a whole lot of Kimchee.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.097
I'm just saying it's weird.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.932
I would've never
pictured them together.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.501
I can't stop
picturing them together.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.537
- It's unnerving.
- And weird.

13:25.539 --> 13:28.006
Kimchee just doesn't seem
like NaYoung's type, you know?

13:28.008 --> 13:29.174
And I slept on the couch

13:29.176 --> 13:30.575
So she could
have the waterbed.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.043
And not even a text?

13:32.045 --> 13:33.812
I'll say it.
It's inconsiderate.

13:33.814 --> 13:34.946
Who am I to judge?

13:34.948 --> 13:37.215
Two consenting adults.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.050
They can do what they want.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.687
- But weird, right?
- Totally.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.189
Hair of the dog?

13:44.191 --> 13:45.356
I bet they drank too much

13:45.358 --> 13:47.192
And can't even remember
what happened.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.394
They're probably
so embarrassed right now.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.662
Maybe.

13:50.664 --> 13:53.264
I might get the big scrambler
with extra cheese.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.933
She can't even
make a clean getaway.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.301
Eat away the pain.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.236
She's got to sit through
brunch with everyone.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.438
She must be kicking herself.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.676
I'm an attractive guy, right?

14:05.645 --> 14:07.679
Sure.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.714
Don't you think this
whole thing is just a bit...

14:09.716 --> 14:12.016
- Weird?
- Thank you. You get it.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.523
<i>Yeobo,</i> I can't find Jung.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.325
Come. I make tea.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.994
Oh, no time. Store is still...

14:23.630 --> 14:25.430
What's happen?

14:25.432 --> 14:28.733
Oh, I bring him upstairs,
so we can have snack together.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.102
What? No. We have work to do.

14:31.104 --> 14:34.205
<i>Yeobo,</i> it's just one
cup of tea. We talk.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.108
Jung is for selling,
not talking.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.613
Your<i> eomma</i> is going crazy.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.381
(sighs)

14:47.254 --> 14:49.354
Kimchee: Whatever you do,
don't cross this line.

14:49.356 --> 14:53.358
Which line?
This line? Or this line?

14:53.360 --> 14:54.826
Watch it, Korea,
that's an act of war.

14:54.828 --> 14:56.327
Don't you think this is weird?

14:56.329 --> 14:58.930
Eh, it's a little weird,
but they also seem happy.

14:58.932 --> 15:00.031
(NaYoung giggling)

15:00.033 --> 15:01.065
Get a room, you two.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.767
- Too late.
- Oh! (giggles)

15:02.769 --> 15:05.870
Okay, is it just me
or is the food taking forever?

15:05.872 --> 15:07.639
We just ordered.

15:07.641 --> 15:08.907
Everything okay?

15:08.909 --> 15:10.341
Well, actually, no.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.744
You didn't come home
last night, I was worried

15:12.746 --> 15:14.279
And no one seems to care.

15:14.281 --> 15:17.248
I don't mean
to make you ugly mad, <i>eonni.</i>

15:17.250 --> 15:18.750
It's okay.
Everything worked out.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.318
Gerald: Yeah, I mean,
who would've thought

15:20.320 --> 15:22.687
You would've ended up
with Kimchee, right?

15:22.689 --> 15:26.591
And not anyone else here that,
like, you're not related to?

15:26.593 --> 15:30.194
I couldn't help
Kimchee cute earlobe.

15:30.196 --> 15:31.663
Right, <i>eonni?</i>

15:32.499 --> 15:34.032
Jung: What?

15:34.034 --> 15:35.433
I... I don't know what
she's talking about.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.169
- Yah, from...
- Just drop it!

15:38.171 --> 15:42.707
I mean, yeah,
that is a funny story.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.242
Did I not tell you guys?

15:44.244 --> 15:45.476
Oh. (chuckles nervously)

15:45.478 --> 15:47.278
NaYoung found something
in the letters

15:47.280 --> 15:49.013
I wrote as a kid.

15:49.015 --> 15:51.616
You still have
a crush on Kimchee.

15:51.618 --> 15:52.684
No!

15:54.254 --> 15:57.221
Mine was a long time ago.
I was a stupid kid.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.690
You used to be tall.

15:58.692 --> 15:59.991
How did I not know this?

15:59.993 --> 16:01.960
- I was tall for my age.
- No, the crush.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.061
(sighs)

16:03.063 --> 16:05.530
(sobbing) I'm so sorry, <i>eonni!</i>

16:07.600 --> 16:08.866
Kimchee: It's okay.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.936
Maybe we should stop having
"together-fun time."

16:11.938 --> 16:13.237
For Janet.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.007
I'm fine with your
"together-fun time."

16:16.009 --> 16:17.208
Maybe not at the table...

16:17.210 --> 16:18.643
And if we're
voicing our concerns...

16:18.645 --> 16:20.078
We're not.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.981
I'm sorry I said anything.
Maybe I should just go.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.682
Have brunch, enjoy yourselves.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.985
I will see you
back at the apartment.

16:32.692 --> 16:33.758
Mmm.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.859
Hello, ms. Michelle.

16:34.861 --> 16:36.294
- Hey, Mr. Kim.
- Hmm.

16:36.296 --> 16:39.030
Good price, huh?
My son tell you about this?

16:39.032 --> 16:42.000
- Who?
- My son, Jung. Outside.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.471
No, I didn't speak
to anyone outside.

16:46.473 --> 16:50.341
Cardboard cutout. Hmm?
Advertise big sale.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.744
Oh.

16:52.746 --> 16:54.846
Right. Nice.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.681
Okay, see you.

17:01.454 --> 17:02.954
(muffled thuds)

17:04.457 --> 17:05.523
Stop!

17:06.993 --> 17:08.259
(exclaims)

17:08.261 --> 17:09.660
Stop!

17:09.662 --> 17:10.795
That's my son!

17:10.797 --> 17:12.430
Give to me back my son!

17:12.999 --> 17:14.365
Shit.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.401
Leave it.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.404
Yah, you better run!

17:19.406 --> 17:21.506
I see you near
my store again...

17:22.575 --> 17:23.641
(sighs)

17:24.344 --> 17:25.576
Oh, Jung.

17:27.614 --> 17:28.679
(grunts)

17:28.681 --> 17:30.014
Okay.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.451
Take you back to home.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.055
This is not a good sign.

17:40.026 --> 17:42.293
Someone should go get Janet.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.895
Yeah, Gerald,
you're her roommate, you go.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.763
I was thinking she could use
some family right now, hmm?

17:45.765 --> 17:46.931
Or the guy she has a crush on.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.433
Had.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.068
I go.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.570
Hey. I forgot my bag.

17:52.572 --> 17:56.441
And I see the food is here,
so I'm just going to sit down.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.379
Have my food, I don't deserve.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.915
No, it's fine.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.117
Everybody, just eat.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.757
Okay, go ahead, make fun.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.992
What? You were a kid.

18:14.994 --> 18:17.161
I was your brother's friend.
No big deal.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.797
Definitely.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.567
Kind of cute that you saw me
that way, though.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.435
I did. But I don't.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.970
You don't know
what you're missing.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.605
I know how to show
a girl a good time.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.474
She knows how to show herself
a good time.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.541
(giggling)

18:31.611 --> 18:32.610
Ugh. You want my bacon?

18:32.612 --> 18:34.412
Now you're just
throwing yourself at me.

18:35.515 --> 18:38.616
Dude, if you want bacon,
order bacon!

18:38.618 --> 18:40.618
Nah, I'm good.

18:44.524 --> 18:45.590
(sighs)

18:47.794 --> 18:49.260
What happened?

18:49.262 --> 18:51.596
Jung get in fight
selling peach.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.898
How he get in fight?
He is just cardboard.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.601
Teenage kid pick
on him, punch him,

18:56.603 --> 18:58.569
Try to drag him away.

18:58.571 --> 19:02.607
I try to save, but, uh,
I run out of duct tape.

19:03.176 --> 19:05.843
You do your best.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.979
But I don't want
Frankenstein Jung.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.616
I want real Jung.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.253
I know.

19:15.255 --> 19:18.589
And, uh, maybe
you are not ready...

19:20.760 --> 19:22.426
But I am.

19:27.433 --> 19:30.334
Okay. Okay.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.304
But this one is... Throw out.

19:44.384 --> 19:47.385
This hurt me
more than it hurt you.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.297
Okay, maybe not more.

20:05.338 --> 20:09.941
Thank you, Janet.
This weekend is so fun time.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.075
Yeah, it was pretty fun.

20:11.077 --> 20:13.578
Hmm. I thought
it was just okay.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.845
(knocking on door)

20:14.847 --> 20:16.214
Oh. You expecting anyone?

20:16.216 --> 20:18.382
Is my friend, Thomas.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.054
(gasps and exclaims)

20:29.462 --> 20:30.561
Hi.

20:32.332 --> 20:37.335
Oh, Janet, this Thomas.
Thomas, this Gerald.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.704
I'll take this
down to the car?

20:39.706 --> 20:41.772
Yes, please.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.107
(NaYoung giggles)

20:46.679 --> 20:47.745
So, what's going on?

20:47.747 --> 20:52.083
Thomas is, how you say,
Waterloo friend.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.819
And Kimchee...

20:54.821 --> 20:55.953
Toronto friend?

20:55.955 --> 20:57.421
You understand!

20:57.423 --> 20:59.690
Is it possible you might have
too many friends?

20:59.692 --> 21:00.725
No.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.394
Okay, bye!

21:04.030 --> 21:05.596
See you!

21:05.598 --> 21:07.231
Bye, NaYoung.

21:12.205 --> 21:13.504
Well, there you go.

21:13.506 --> 21:14.839
What?

21:14.841 --> 21:16.140
You kidding me?

21:16.142 --> 21:17.642
Guy looks just like me.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.776
Okay.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.681
