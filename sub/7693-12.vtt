WEBVTT

00:08.138 --> 00:09.310
ALL RIGHT, ADAM.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.482
I BORROWED BIG D'S
HYDROGEN-POWERED GOLF CART

00:11.482 --> 00:13.144
TO HELP YOU PRACTICE
FOR YOUR DRIVING TEST.

00:13.144 --> 00:15.516
FIRST STEP, SEAT BELTS.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.189
OKAY... FOCUS.

00:20.651 --> 00:21.622
( grunts )

00:21.622 --> 00:23.354
( seatbelt clicks )
 YES!

00:23.354 --> 00:26.657
ZERO TO BUCKLE
IN UNDER FIVE SECONDS.

00:28.559 --> 00:30.131
( chuckles )

00:30.131 --> 00:33.464
OH, LOOK,
A DUMMY DRIVING A DUMMY.

00:33.464 --> 00:35.336
OOH, WHAT'S THIS BUTTON DO?

00:35.336 --> 00:36.537
NO!

00:36.537 --> 00:37.668
AAH!

00:37.668 --> 00:39.170
BRAKE!

00:39.170 --> 00:40.211
( brakes screech,
Chase continues screaming )

00:40.211 --> 00:41.672
( grunts )

00:42.813 --> 00:45.646
WISH ALL BUTTONS DID THAT.

00:47.648 --> 00:50.681
THE WORLD'S FIRST BIONIC
SUPER-HUMANS.

00:50.681 --> 00:54.585
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
FASTER, SMARTER.

00:54.585 --> 00:57.328
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

00:57.328 --> 00:59.290
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

00:59.290 --> 01:00.291
♪♪

01:02.193 --> 01:03.794
♪ LAB RATS ♪

01:05.636 --> 01:07.538
♪ LAB RATS ♪

01:16.477 --> 01:18.078
♪ LAB RATS ♪

01:20.111 --> 01:21.712
♪ LAB RATS ♪

01:28.519 --> 01:30.491
♪ LAB RATS ♪

01:39.200 --> 01:41.872
I CAN'T BELIEVE ADAM'S
NOT BACK FROM HIS DRIVING TEST.

01:41.872 --> 01:43.504
WHAT'S TAKING HIM SO LONG?

01:43.504 --> 01:46.407
TWO WORDS: ADAM. TEST.

01:46.407 --> 01:50.181
MAN, IF HE PASSES,
IT'S GOOD NEWS FOR US

01:50.181 --> 01:52.343
AND BAD NEWS
FOR EVERYONE ON THE ROAD.

01:52.343 --> 01:53.284
( chuckles )

01:53.284 --> 01:54.845
OR THE SIDEWALK.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.348
WELL, HE HAS TO PASS.

01:57.348 --> 01:59.119
I NEED HIM TO DRIVE ME
TO THAT PARTY ON SATURDAY.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.291
WHAT PARTY?

02:00.291 --> 02:01.492
( chuckles )

02:01.492 --> 02:03.194
THE ONE YOU WEREN'T INVITED TO.

02:03.194 --> 02:05.596
YOU GOT INVITED

02:05.596 --> 02:08.359
TO CAROLINE DAVIS' PARTY
AND I DIDN'T?

02:08.359 --> 02:09.759
NEITHER DID I!

02:09.759 --> 02:11.162
WELL, NO SURPRISE THERE.

02:11.162 --> 02:14.165
BUT WHY WERE YOU INVITED?

02:14.165 --> 02:16.837
OH, BREE, I'M CLIMBING
THE SOCIAL LADDER.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.439
THERE ARE NOW
THREE OR FOUR LADIES

02:18.439 --> 02:20.711
WHO MAKE EYE CONTACT
WITH ME IN THE HALLWAY.

02:22.313 --> 02:24.345
OKAY, IT'S TWO!
BUT I'M GOING TO THE PARTY.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.376
( door opening )

02:25.376 --> 02:26.377
HE'S HOME!

02:26.377 --> 02:28.219
( all groan )

02:28.219 --> 02:29.550
IT'S JUST YOU.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.283
NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO.

02:32.283 --> 02:33.684
SORRY, MOM.
HOW'S IT GOING?

02:33.684 --> 02:36.187
GREAT. I'VE HAD THE BEST DAY.
IT ALL STARTED WHEN--

02:36.187 --> 02:37.928
SAVE IT FOR LATER, WOMAN!
ADAM'S HERE!

02:40.291 --> 02:42.393
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I GIVE YOU

02:42.393 --> 02:47.498
MISSION CREEK'S
NEWEST FULLY LICENSED DRIVER!

02:51.242 --> 02:52.243
ADAM, THAT'S YOU.

02:52.243 --> 02:53.844
Adam: OH, RIGHT.

02:53.844 --> 02:55.276
WOO-HOO, I PASSED!

02:55.276 --> 02:57.308
( all cheering )

02:57.308 --> 02:58.309
HE REALLY IMPRESSED ME.

02:58.309 --> 03:00.351
HE GOT A 96 ON THE TEST.

03:00.351 --> 03:02.653
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW SCORES
WENT UP THAT HIGH!

03:03.654 --> 03:05.356
OH, AND GET THIS,
MR. DAVENPORT SAID

03:05.356 --> 03:07.358
IF I PASSED,
HE'D BUY ME A CAR.

03:08.319 --> 03:09.460
WHAT?!

03:09.460 --> 03:11.322
WELL, IN MY DEFENSE,

03:11.322 --> 03:13.564
I NEVER THOUGHT
HE WOULD PASS.

03:13.564 --> 03:16.767
YEAH, NONE OF US DID.

03:16.767 --> 03:19.800
PREACHIN' TO THE CHOIR,
PEOPLE.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.503
DONALD, ARE YOU SURE
HE'S READY FOR A CAR?

03:22.503 --> 03:24.635
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU BOUGHT HIM A BIKE?

03:30.681 --> 03:32.343
THE BELL STILL WORKS.

03:32.343 --> 03:33.384
( dings bell )

03:36.247 --> 03:37.848
UM... TO BE FAIR, HONEY,

03:37.848 --> 03:39.950
ADAM IS A LOT MORE
RESPONSIBLE NOW.

03:39.950 --> 03:41.552
HE WORKED VERY HARD
TO GET HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE,

03:41.552 --> 03:43.624
AND I THINK HE
SHOULD BE REWARDED.

03:43.624 --> 03:47.928
( imitates driving noises,
brakes screeching, explosion )

03:47.928 --> 03:52.763
I DON'T KNOW.

03:52.763 --> 03:55.406
DON'T WORRY,
I PROMISE I WILL GET ADAM

03:55.406 --> 03:57.408
THE SAFEST CAR AVAILABLE.

03:57.408 --> 04:00.611
THE SAFEST CAR IS THE ONE
HE ISN'T DRIVING.

04:00.611 --> 04:03.274
NOT TRUE.

04:03.274 --> 04:05.946
I'VE CAUSED MANY WRECKS
AS A PEDESTRIAN.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.278
OKAY, LET'S GO.

04:07.278 --> 04:08.749
I DON'T CARE WHAT CAR IT IS,

04:08.749 --> 04:11.352
AS LONG AS YOU GIVE ME A RIDE
TO CAROLINE DAVIS' PARTY.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.653
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD...

04:12.653 --> 04:14.355
I WAS INVITED.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.427
ENOUGH!

04:21.632 --> 04:25.436
TAKE CARE, LADIES.
SEE YOU AT THE PARTY.

04:25.436 --> 04:28.799
OH, DID I TELL YOU
I WAS INVITED TO THE PAR--

04:28.799 --> 04:30.270
Both: YES!

04:32.543 --> 04:34.405
THERE'S MY LITTLE BOY!

04:35.606 --> 04:36.607
MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

04:43.013 --> 04:46.016
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, TASHA?

04:46.016 --> 04:50.421
I'M HERE BECAUSE I DECIDED
TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE PTA!

04:50.421 --> 04:51.962
OH, THAT'S NICE.

04:51.962 --> 04:54.525
WHAT SCHOOL?!
'CAUSE I KNOW IT'S NOT THIS ONE!

04:55.966 --> 04:58.298
WITH ADAM GETTING HIS LICENSE

04:58.298 --> 04:59.900
AND YOU GOING TO PARTIES,

04:59.900 --> 05:02.403
IT MADE ME REALIZE
THAT YOU'RE ALL GROWING UP.

05:02.403 --> 05:06.677
SO I'M GOING TO GET A LOT MORE
INVOLVED IN YOUR SCHOOL LIVES.

05:06.677 --> 05:09.380
WELL, LEO COULD
DEFINITELY USE

05:09.380 --> 05:10.941
A CHAPERONE FOR
THE PARTY THIS WEEKEND.

05:10.941 --> 05:13.644
NO!
NO, NO, NO!

05:13.644 --> 05:15.346
MOM, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!

05:15.346 --> 05:16.487
WHAT IS MISSING IN YOUR LIFE?

05:16.487 --> 05:18.519
I CAN PAY FOR ART CLASSES!

05:18.519 --> 05:21.692
OH, LEO, THIS WILL BE FUN!

05:21.692 --> 05:25.396
IF I GET ELECTED
I WILL BE HERE ALL THE TIME!

05:25.396 --> 05:27.528
WE'LL EAT LUNCH, GOSSIP,

05:27.528 --> 05:29.600
I CAN TALK YOU UP TO THE GALS.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.562
THE GALS?

05:31.562 --> 05:33.764
GET HER OUT!
GET HER OUT!

05:35.065 --> 05:36.937
DON'T WORRY.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.510
ONCE THE LADIES SEE
HOW MOM ROCKS IT,

05:39.510 --> 05:42.473
OOO!
YOU ARE GOING TO BE SO POPULAR.

05:42.473 --> 05:44.074
Both: YOU REALLY ARE.

05:45.716 --> 05:48.549
HI, I'M LEO'S MOM.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.751
I'M RUNNING
FOR PRESIDENT OF THE PTA,

05:50.751 --> 05:53.924
WHICH IS "PRETTY TOTALLY
AWESOME," RIGHT?

05:53.924 --> 05:56.427
NO!

05:56.427 --> 05:59.760
BE SURE TO TELL YOUR PARENTS
TO VOTE FOR ME: TASHA DAVENPORT!

05:59.760 --> 06:01.762
T-DAV TO YOU KIDS.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.395
HOLLER!

06:06.066 --> 06:08.399
MOMS...

06:08.399 --> 06:11.472
WE ALL GOT 'EM, AM I RIGHT?

06:18.549 --> 06:20.981
THE 2006 FIREFLY
IS A GREAT CHOICE.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.513
IT'S SAFE ENOUGH FOR GRANDMA,

06:22.513 --> 06:24.384
YET FLASHY ENOUGH FOR...

06:24.384 --> 06:25.516
GRANDMA.

06:27.057 --> 06:28.058
SWEET.

06:28.058 --> 06:29.860
AND I KNOW WE
GOT A GREAT DEAL

06:29.860 --> 06:32.392
BECAUSE I AM A
MASTER NEGOTIATOR!

06:32.392 --> 06:34.124
OH, THAT'S ONE THING
I'D CALL YOU.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.828
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

06:37.828 --> 06:39.029
( phone ringing )

06:39.029 --> 06:40.130
EXCUSE ME.

06:40.130 --> 06:42.072
THIS IS WORK.

06:42.072 --> 06:43.534
HELLO?

06:43.534 --> 06:45.035
WHAT?!

06:45.035 --> 06:48.078
WELL, WOULD THEY BE
THROWING A SURPRISE PARTY

06:48.078 --> 06:50.010
INSIDE A NUCLEAR REACTOR?

06:52.082 --> 06:53.143
WE GOTTA GO.

06:53.143 --> 06:56.116
AHH, JUST WHEN I STARTED
TO LIKE YOU.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.448
EVERYBODY LIKES ME.

06:57.448 --> 06:58.719
WE'LL FINISH THIS TOMORROW.

06:58.719 --> 07:02.152
NO PROBLEM,
BUT THE FIREFLY WILL BE GONE.

07:02.152 --> 07:04.925
I PLAN ON SELLING IT TO SOMEONE
I CAN ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY ON.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.428
YOU'RE GONNA SELL MY CAR?!

07:08.428 --> 07:10.130
THAT'S JUST A SALES TACTIC,
ADAM. COME ON, WE GOTTA GO.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.832
OH, BUT, NO,
WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.634
CAN'T I JUST
FINISH UP WITHOUT YOU?

07:13.634 --> 07:14.965
( laughs )
NO!

07:14.965 --> 07:16.106
( sighs )
COME ON!

07:16.106 --> 07:17.137
YOU SAID YOURSELF

07:17.137 --> 07:19.039
I'M ACTING MORE
RESPONSIBLE THAN EVER.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.971
PLUS, I REALLY
WANT THAT CAR.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.615
FINE, I'LL SEE YOU
BACK AT THE HOUSE.

07:24.615 --> 07:26.477
SALLY, SALLY, SALLY!

07:26.477 --> 07:28.448
STOP SINGING HAPPY BIRTHDAY

07:28.448 --> 07:30.521
AND PUT ON YOUR HAZMAT SUIT,
I'LL BE RIGHT--

07:32.723 --> 07:35.055
SO, HERE WE ARE,

07:35.055 --> 07:38.659
TWO ADULTS, FINISHING UP
AN AUTOMOTIVE TRANSACTION.

07:38.659 --> 07:42.162
WHERE SHALL I PUT
MY JOHN PEACOCK?

07:42.162 --> 07:44.865
JUST SIGN RIGHT HERE.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.497
UH-HUH.

07:46.497 --> 07:48.038
YOU KNOW...

07:48.038 --> 07:49.199
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

07:49.199 --> 07:52.072
THERE'S ONE MORE VEHICLE
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.845
OKAY, I'LL LOOK AT IT.

07:54.845 --> 07:57.077
BUT UNLESS IT'S SHAPED
LIKE A GIANT HOT DOG,

07:57.077 --> 07:58.949
I'M PROBABLY NOT INTERESTED.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.586
GUYS, GET THIS.

08:05.586 --> 08:08.188
I AM THE ONLY CANDIDATE
FOR PTA PRESIDENT.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.590
I'M GONNA WIN!

08:09.590 --> 08:11.892
CAR WASHES, BAKE SALES,
FUND RAISERS.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.494
I'LL BE HERE ALL THE TIME.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.166
THAT IS GREAT NEWS.

08:16.166 --> 08:18.098
LEO'S GONNA BE SO HAPPY.

08:22.172 --> 08:23.534
AHEM.

08:28.138 --> 08:29.940
WE HAVE TO STOP HER.

08:29.940 --> 08:30.941
UH, WE?

08:30.941 --> 08:32.212
WHAT'S IN IT FOR US?

08:32.212 --> 08:34.715
OH, COME ON!
I'M DESPERATE!

08:34.715 --> 08:39.549
WELL, YOU COULD GET US
INTO YOUR COOL PARTY.

08:39.549 --> 08:42.052
OH, BREE. THAT'S CUTE.

08:43.594 --> 08:44.595
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

08:44.595 --> 08:46.126
I AM WHO I AM AND YOU ARE WHO--

08:46.126 --> 08:48.058
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET YOU
IN THE PARTY!

08:49.860 --> 08:52.132
JUST TELL ME HOW WE'RE
GET RID OF MY MOM.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.133
EASY.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.264
WE JUST HAVE TO FIND SOMEONE

08:54.264 --> 08:56.106
TO RUN AGAINST HER AND WIN.

08:56.106 --> 08:59.670
RIGHT, SOMEONE WHO'S
POWER HUNGRY AND RUTHLESS

08:59.670 --> 09:02.673
AND ENJOYS CRUSHING
OTHER PEOPLE'S DREAMS.

09:02.673 --> 09:03.814
GO HOME, MAGGOTS!

09:03.814 --> 09:06.076
IT'S 3:30
AND I WANNA CHAIN UP!

09:14.024 --> 09:15.856
AND, JUST LIKE I PROMISED,

09:15.856 --> 09:20.030
I GOT ADAM A VERY SAFE
AND PRACTICAL CAR.

09:20.030 --> 09:22.292
LOOK, I KNOW EQUATIONS.

09:22.292 --> 09:26.036
ADAM PLUS SAFE
DOESN'T EXACTLY WORK.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.700
SO, WHERE IS HE?

09:29.700 --> 09:31.942
MAYBE HE FORGOT HOW TO GET HOME.

09:31.942 --> 09:32.943
AGAIN.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.748
COME ON, FOUR TIMES IN ONE WEEK?

09:37.748 --> 09:38.809
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

09:40.210 --> 09:41.281
YOU GUYS GET THE STAPLER.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.283
I'LL GO GET
THE "LOST ADAM" FLYERS.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.618
Adam: GUYS!
CHECK OUT MY NEW RIDE!

09:47.618 --> 09:48.789
HE'S HERE!

09:48.789 --> 09:51.121
Bree: LET'S GO.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.327
ISN'T IT AWESOME?

09:57.327 --> 10:00.831
AND I ONLY HAD TO FILL THE TANK
TWICE ON THE WAY HOME.

10:09.179 --> 10:10.310
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:10.310 --> 10:12.743
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BUY THE FIREFLY!

10:12.743 --> 10:14.715
WELL, YEAH,
BUT THE TRUCK IS WAYS SAFER

10:14.715 --> 10:16.346
THAN THAT DINKY LITTLE CAR.

10:16.346 --> 10:17.748
WHEN I DROVE OFF THE LOT,

10:17.748 --> 10:19.720
I CRUSHED THAT THING
LIKE A TIN CAN.

10:21.351 --> 10:23.994
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE LEFT
YOU ALONE TO CLOSE THE DEAL.

10:23.994 --> 10:26.196
YOU LEFT HIM ALONE?

10:26.196 --> 10:28.098
WITH HIS CHECKBOOK!

10:29.860 --> 10:32.032
SEE, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

10:32.032 --> 10:34.404
WHEN PARENTS AREN'T INVOLVED
IN THEIR KIDS' LIVES.

10:34.404 --> 10:36.006
I'M INVOLVED IN THEIR LIVES.

10:36.006 --> 10:37.768
WE GO ON MISSIONS ALL THE TIME.

10:37.768 --> 10:39.770
THEIR REAL LIVES.

10:39.770 --> 10:43.013
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SHOWED UP AT SCHOOL?

10:43.013 --> 10:44.214
OH, HE WAS JUST
THERE LAST WEEK.

10:44.214 --> 10:45.215
THANK YOU.

10:45.215 --> 10:46.216
YEAH, HE PULLED US
OUT OF CLASS

10:46.216 --> 10:47.778
SO WE COULD ALL PLAY
LASER TAG TOGETHER.

10:49.780 --> 10:52.823
YOU'VE SEEN HIS GRADES.
WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE?

10:52.823 --> 10:54.885
LOOK, WE'LL TAKE
THE TRUCK BACK TOMORROW.

10:54.885 --> 10:55.986
FINE!

10:55.986 --> 10:57.087
AND WHILE WE'RE THERE,

10:57.087 --> 10:59.329
WE SHOULD PROBABLY PICK UP
YOUR CHECKBOOK.

11:05.235 --> 11:07.437
GUYS, GUESS WHAT?

11:07.437 --> 11:09.940
WHAT?

11:12.843 --> 11:13.974
LEO!

11:13.974 --> 11:15.706
NO.

11:15.706 --> 11:18.108
I'M THE NEW CHEMISTRY TEACHER,
MR. TATE.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.012
( high-pitched scream )

11:25.716 --> 11:26.857
SO, GET THIS.

11:26.857 --> 11:28.989
I CHECKED THE PTA ELECTION RULES

11:28.989 --> 11:31.862
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
A PARENT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

11:31.862 --> 11:34.094
PRINCIPAL PERRY
IS TOTALLY ELIGIBLE.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.726
WELL, THAT'S GREAT!

11:35.726 --> 11:36.997
AND YOU KNOW THAT IF SHE RUNS,

11:36.997 --> 11:38.929
SHE'S GONNA CHEAT
AND MAKE SURE SHE WINS.

11:38.929 --> 11:41.872
YOU CAN ALWAYS
COUNT ON THAT WOMAN

11:41.872 --> 11:44.104
TO DO THE WRONG THING.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.236
BUT HOW DO WE
CONVINCE HER TO RUN?

11:46.236 --> 11:48.208
THE ONLY THINGS
THAT MOTIVATE THAT WOMAN

11:48.208 --> 11:52.282
ARE REVENGE, RAGE,
AND KITTY CALENDARS.

11:52.282 --> 11:54.745
WELL, THEN WE JUST
HAVE TO FIND A WAY

11:54.745 --> 11:56.086
TO MAKE HER MAD AT TASHA

11:56.086 --> 11:57.487
AND THEN TRICK HER
INTO DOING IT.

11:57.487 --> 11:58.919
HOW?

11:58.919 --> 12:03.723
MAYBE A LITTLE BIONIC VOCAL
MANIPULATION IS IN ORDER.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.896
( in Tasha's voice )
THERE'S MY LITTLE BUG-A-BOO.

12:05.896 --> 12:08.298
COME GIVE MOMMY SOME SUGAR!

12:10.330 --> 12:12.863
OKAY, THAT NEVER
STOPS BEING WEIRD.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.969
OKAY, CHASE
IS GETTING PERRY.

12:18.969 --> 12:20.470
YOU GO HANDLE YOUR MOM.

12:20.470 --> 12:21.471
GOT IT.

12:21.471 --> 12:23.743
MOM!

12:23.743 --> 12:26.877
HEY, I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

12:26.877 --> 12:28.148
IT IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN

12:28.148 --> 12:29.820
HAVING YOU AROUND HERE EVERYDAY.

12:29.820 --> 12:33.053
( squeals, giggles )

12:33.053 --> 12:34.985
I KNEW YOU WOULD
COME AROUND.

12:34.985 --> 12:36.426
HEY, LOVE ME,
DON'T BREAK ME.

12:38.188 --> 12:40.260
SO, TO BE AN EFFECTIVE
PTA PRESIDENT

12:40.260 --> 12:42.532
YOU NEED TO BE IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR STUDENTS,

12:42.532 --> 12:44.895
KNOW WHAT THEY LIKE,
LISTEN TO THEIR MUSIC.

12:44.895 --> 12:46.436
DON'T WORRY, LEO.

12:46.436 --> 12:49.539
I'M PICKING UP WHAT
YOU'RE PUTTING DOWN.

12:49.539 --> 12:53.243
( chuckling )
YOU'RE TRYING TOO HARD.

12:56.446 --> 12:58.849
THIS BETTER BE IMPORTANT,
SHRUB HEAD.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.251
QUICK!
PUT THESE ON.

13:01.251 --> 13:05.485
OOH, THESE JAMS
ARE PUMPED UP!

13:07.257 --> 13:10.821
I JUST THOUGHT THAT
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR

13:10.821 --> 13:12.192
WHAT OUR FUTURE PTA PRESIDENT

13:12.192 --> 13:13.523
IS BEEN SAYING
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

13:13.523 --> 13:14.895
( scoffs )

13:14.895 --> 13:16.466
( Bree in Tasha's voice )
I AM SHOCKED

13:16.466 --> 13:18.568
AT THE LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM
AROUND THIS SCHOOL.

13:18.568 --> 13:22.132
AND IT ALL STARTS WITH
THAT TYRANT PRINCIPAL PERRY.

13:22.132 --> 13:24.534
WELL, THAT'S OBVIOUS.

13:24.534 --> 13:26.136
WHEN I'M PRESIDENT

13:26.136 --> 13:29.809
I'M GONNA MAKE IT MY MISSION
TO GET HER FIRED!

13:29.809 --> 13:30.941
FIRED?!

13:30.941 --> 13:32.242
SHE CAN'T DO THAT!

13:32.242 --> 13:35.045
TECHNICALLY,
AS PTA PRESIDENT, SHE CAN.

13:35.045 --> 13:36.046
IT'S RIGHT HERE
IN THE RULE BOOK.

13:36.046 --> 13:37.387
LET ME SEE THAT!

13:37.387 --> 13:38.989
OH, ONE MORE THING,

13:38.989 --> 13:40.550
I HATE CATS.

13:40.550 --> 13:43.593
( gasps )
THE CLAWS ARE OUT NOW!

13:43.593 --> 13:47.898
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD RUN AGAINST HER.

13:47.898 --> 13:48.859
AGAINST HER?

13:48.859 --> 13:50.530
I'M GONNA RUN OVER HER!

13:50.530 --> 13:52.232
HEY!

13:52.232 --> 13:54.564
OH, HI,
PRINCIPAL PERRY!

13:54.564 --> 13:55.835
DID YOU HEAR?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.407
NO ONE IS RUNNING AGAINST ME.

13:57.407 --> 14:00.110
I'M GOING TO BE PTA PRESIDENT.

14:00.110 --> 14:02.612
NOT IN THIS LIFETIME,
MITZY VON MINIVAN.

14:03.613 --> 14:05.946
I'M IN THE RACE NOW,
AND AROUND HERE,

14:05.946 --> 14:07.617
THE ONLY THING
PTA STANDS FOR

14:07.617 --> 14:10.420
IS PUTTING TANYA AWAY.

14:11.451 --> 14:12.883
MY NAME IS TASHA.

14:12.883 --> 14:14.354
STILL STARTS WITH A "T"!

14:16.326 --> 14:17.527
( gasps )

14:20.230 --> 14:22.332
ADAM, I REALLY STUCK
MY NECK OUT FOR YOU,

14:22.332 --> 14:24.364
AND YOU MADE US BOTH
LOOK IRRESPONSIBLE.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.896
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:25.896 --> 14:27.537
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

14:29.539 --> 14:30.540
WOW.

14:30.540 --> 14:32.302
LOOK HOW HIGH I AM.

14:32.302 --> 14:34.004
THAT'S WHAT I SAID!

14:34.004 --> 14:37.978
THAT PICKUP TRUCK LOOKS
LIKE A TEENY TINY TOY.

14:37.978 --> 14:41.611
THAT'S WHAT I SAID!

14:41.611 --> 14:45.115
YOU KNOW, BEFORE I
TAKE THIS THING BACK,

14:45.115 --> 14:48.058
THERE'S SOMETHING
I REALLY NEED TO DO.

14:48.058 --> 14:50.991
WOO-HOO!
 OH, YEAH!

14:50.991 --> 14:52.122
( screaming )

14:57.427 --> 14:58.999
( screaming continues )

14:58.999 --> 15:01.401
WOO! THIS IS AWESOME!

15:01.401 --> 15:03.573
THAT'S WHAT I SAID!

15:03.573 --> 15:05.075
( both screaming )

15:07.107 --> 15:08.538
WHOA!

15:15.615 --> 15:18.618
( both screaming )

15:23.593 --> 15:25.255
LET'S DO THIS ALREADY!

15:25.255 --> 15:28.959
I'M LATE FOR MY SHIFT
AT THE GAS-N-GO.

15:28.959 --> 15:30.100
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

15:33.003 --> 15:34.104
HEY, MOM?

15:34.104 --> 15:36.266
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS?

15:36.266 --> 15:39.639
PRINCIPAL PERRY IS MERCILESS
AND WILL DO ANYTHING TO WIN.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.641
SHE HAS THE BATTLE SCARS
TO PROVE IT.

15:43.573 --> 15:45.575
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH
IN YOUR MOM.

15:45.575 --> 15:48.318
OH, I HAVE LOTS OF FAITH.

15:48.318 --> 15:51.621
THAT PRINCIPAL PERRY
IS GOING TO DESTROY YOU.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.288
SO I GUESS WE'RE
KEEPING THIS THING, HUH?

15:58.288 --> 16:03.133
YEAH, I FINALLY FOUND A CAR
THAT MATCHES MY EGO.

16:03.133 --> 16:04.364
( laughs )

16:04.364 --> 16:05.395
IT'S NOT THAT BIG.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.138
( thump )
 OOH, WHAT WAS THAT?

16:08.138 --> 16:09.569
TRASH CAN.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.471
I'LL PAY FOR THAT!

16:12.642 --> 16:14.404
SO, HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING.

16:14.404 --> 16:15.645
WE'LL BUY YOU A DIFFERENT CAR,

16:15.645 --> 16:18.108
AND WE'LL KEEP THIS BAD BOY
TO PLAY WITH ON WEEKENDS.

16:18.108 --> 16:19.479
AWESOME!

16:19.479 --> 16:20.580
BUT WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO HIDE IT.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.652
'CAUSE IF TASHA
FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS THING,

16:22.652 --> 16:24.684
WE'RE BOTH GONNA
END UP LIVING IN IT.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.116
( gasps )
PROMISE?!

16:26.116 --> 16:28.218
( thumping )

16:28.218 --> 16:29.259
OH! TRASH CAN?

16:29.259 --> 16:30.360
MAIL BOX.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.592
I'LL PAY FOR THAT, TOO!

16:34.364 --> 16:35.695
OH! CAN WE MAKE A QUICK STOP?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.467
I FORGOT MY BACKPACK AT SCHOOL.

16:37.467 --> 16:39.199
NO PROBLEM. WE CAN STOP BY
AND PICK IT UP.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.670
( loud metal clanging )

16:40.670 --> 16:41.701
MAIL BOX?

16:41.701 --> 16:43.503
MAIL TRUCK.

16:49.439 --> 16:50.440
( microphone feedback )

16:50.440 --> 16:52.042
( clears throat, choking )

16:54.584 --> 16:55.745
VOTE FOR ME,

16:55.745 --> 16:57.617
I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.

17:01.491 --> 17:03.553
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT,
MOM JEANS.

17:03.553 --> 17:05.555
THIS ELECTION'S MINE.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.661
BEFORE I LAY OUT MY PLATFORM,

17:11.661 --> 17:13.663
I SPENT SOME TIME GOING THROUGH

17:13.663 --> 17:15.665
THE SCHOOL'S ACCOUNTING
RECORDS--

17:15.665 --> 17:17.036
( Perry clearing throat )

17:17.036 --> 17:18.068
I WITHDRAW!

17:21.741 --> 17:22.712
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:22.712 --> 17:25.744
SAVING A FORTUNE IN LEGAL FEES!

17:25.744 --> 17:26.816
WAIT, HOLD ON!

17:26.816 --> 17:28.518
ACCORDING TO THE RULES,

17:28.518 --> 17:30.420
IT IS PAST THE DEADLINE
TO WITHDRAWALS.

17:30.420 --> 17:31.581
HE'S RIGHT!

17:31.581 --> 17:33.383
SO WE STILL NEED TO
HEAR FINAL SPEECHES

17:33.383 --> 17:34.384
AND THEN VOTE.

17:35.625 --> 17:37.587
NO SPEECH.
I VOTE TASHA.

17:37.587 --> 17:38.728
( chanting )
TASHA!

17:38.728 --> 17:40.730
TASHA! TASHA!

17:40.730 --> 17:42.392
DON'T MAKE ME
DO ALL THE WORK.

17:42.392 --> 17:44.664
TASHA! TASHA!

17:48.698 --> 17:49.669
WELL, LOOK AT THAT,

17:49.669 --> 17:52.472
GOT A PARKING SPACE
RIGHT NEXT TO THE GYM.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.503
WELL, THREE SPACES.

17:53.503 --> 17:54.674
SORRY, MA'AM. I'LL PAY FOR THAT.

17:56.746 --> 17:58.608
OKAY JUST GIVE ME A SECOND
TO GET MY BACKPACK.

17:58.608 --> 18:01.581
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.
THERE'S NOTHING IN IT.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.652
WAIT!

18:02.652 --> 18:04.254
IS THAT TASHA'S CAR?

18:04.254 --> 18:06.656
YEAH, SHE'S GIVING HER
BIG PTA SPEECH TONIGHT.

18:06.656 --> 18:08.558
( screams )
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT!

18:08.558 --> 18:10.190
SHE CAN'T SEE US IN THIS THING.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.122
WELL, IF SHE CAN'T,
THEN SHE NEEDS GLASSES.

18:12.122 --> 18:13.663
THIS THING IS HUGE.

18:13.663 --> 18:16.366
NO, I MEAN, WE GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE!

18:16.366 --> 18:17.797
WELL, THEN GO ALREADY!

18:17.797 --> 18:19.869
WELL, I'M TRYING,
BUT THE GEAR SHIFT IS STUCK!

18:19.869 --> 18:21.571
WHY DON'T YOU TRY HARDER?

18:22.872 --> 18:24.204
OKAY, I GOT IT!

18:24.204 --> 18:25.635
( screaming )

18:25.635 --> 18:27.477
AND ONCE I'M PRESIDENT,

18:27.477 --> 18:29.309
MISSION CREEK
WILL RUN AS SMOOTHLY

18:29.309 --> 18:32.182
AS MY VERY OWN HAPPY FAMILY.

18:35.185 --> 18:37.387
( screaming )

18:42.222 --> 18:43.453
( both coughing )

18:45.795 --> 18:48.198
QUICK!
BACK UP BEFORE SHE SEES US!

18:49.899 --> 18:51.701
DONALD!

18:51.701 --> 18:53.733
VOTE FOR TASHA.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.764
( honks )

18:56.336 --> 18:58.338
( continues honking )

19:00.740 --> 19:03.343
WELL, THANKS TO YOU
I TOTALLY LOST THE ELECTION!

19:03.343 --> 19:05.315
NOT ONE PERSON VOTED FOR ME!

19:05.315 --> 19:06.516
YES!

19:08.218 --> 19:09.719
YOU WILL GET 'EM
NEXT YEAR, MOM.

19:09.719 --> 19:12.582
BECAUSE OF YOU PERRY WON!

19:12.582 --> 19:14.184
DON'T BE MAD
AT MR. DAVENPORT.

19:14.184 --> 19:15.185
I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

19:15.185 --> 19:16.556
THANK YOU.

19:16.556 --> 19:17.627
IT ALL STARTED
WHEN HE DECIDED

19:17.627 --> 19:19.359
TO KEEP THIS TRUCK
AND HIDE IT FROM YOU.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.460
WHAT?!

19:20.460 --> 19:22.892
Perry: GET ME OUT OF HERE!

19:22.892 --> 19:24.264
IS THAT PRINCIPAL PERRY?

19:24.264 --> 19:26.336
Perry: NO, IT'S TAYLOR SWIFT.

19:27.337 --> 19:29.439
SHE'S UNDER THERE!

19:38.578 --> 19:40.480
ARE YOU OKAY?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.882
I'M FINE,
BUT MY CUPCAKE ISN'T.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.715
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S
FIBERGLASS OR SPRINKLES.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.858
EH, IT'S ALL GOING
TO THE SAME PLACE.

20:00.870 --> 20:01.971
SO...

20:01.971 --> 20:04.374
THIS WAS FUN...

20:06.806 --> 20:10.740
ALL RIGHT, DO YOU
PREFER BIG BILLS OR, UH...

20:10.740 --> 20:12.642
NICE TRY, RICHIE RICH.

20:12.642 --> 20:14.314
YOU CAN'T BUY ME OFF
THAT EASILY.

20:14.314 --> 20:18.318
ALTHOUGH THERE IS
ONE THING I WANT.

20:20.890 --> 20:23.493
( honking )

20:23.493 --> 20:26.696
LET'S GO CRUSH SOME DOGHOUSES,
VICE PRINCIPAL WHISKERS!

20:26.696 --> 20:28.328
( chuckling )
 ( meowing )

20:32.402 --> 20:33.763
( laughing )

20:33.763 --> 20:34.964
WOO-HOO!
