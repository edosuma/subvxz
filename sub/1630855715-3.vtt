FREEMAN: Captain's log,
Stardate 58759.1.

01:37.765 --> 01:41.134
The Cerritos is visiting
the Federation world Corazonia,

01:41.169 --> 01:45.273
an artificial megastructure
in a bespoke star system

01:45.306 --> 01:49.076
designed by a long-extinct
alien species.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.279
The ring has been home
to the Corazonians,

01:51.312 --> 01:54.582
who enjoy perfect climate
and surface conditions

01:54.615 --> 01:57.485
thanks to Vexilon,
the environmental computer

01:57.518 --> 02:00.754
installed by the ring's
original designers.

02:00.788 --> 02:03.624
Fortunately,
Vexilon is a benevolent ally

02:03.657 --> 02:05.859
with no interest
in world domination.

02:05.893 --> 02:10.264
The Corazonians share a deep
bond with their caretaker.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.665
CORAZONIAN:
Thank you for making the trip

02:11.699 --> 02:13.267
on short notice, Captain.

02:13.301 --> 02:15.269
We're very concerned
about Vexilon.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.538
Well, he's not trying
to subjugate anyone, is he?

02:17.571 --> 02:19.573
I thought
he was a friendly computer.

02:19.607 --> 02:22.743
He is, but his hardware
is ancient, wearing down.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.745
Vexilon has been operating
with less accuracy

02:24.778 --> 02:26.380
than we are accustomed.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.316
Your world computer's lagging?

02:28.349 --> 02:30.351
The weather
has become unpredictable.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.886
One minute it's blue skies,
the next it's blizzards.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.756
His geographic processes
are faltering, too.

02:35.789 --> 02:39.159
Just yesterday, one
of our rivers reversed its flow

02:39.192 --> 02:41.795
and flooded a mountain.

02:41.829 --> 02:45.766
We're all artists and poets,
but I've been so stressed.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.536
Just look at the terrible
statues I made last week.

02:48.569 --> 02:51.639
Yeesh. Yeah, that's a pretty
clumsy expression of form.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.641
Those are our finest works.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.776
We're talking
about those over there.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.846
Well, why don't we just go check
on Vexilon,

02:58.879 --> 03:02.416
and afterward you can tell us
all about your creative process?

03:02.450 --> 03:05.219
Just an amateur lack of focus
and balance.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.288
FREEMAN:
Ransom!

03:13.327 --> 03:15.629
VEXILON:
Welcome to Corazonia, Captain.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.498
We appreciate Starfleet's help.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.334
Please enjoy some iced tea.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.338
-Aah! That's hot.
-Damn it! I'm so stupid!

03:24.372 --> 03:27.541
It's totally normal
for a planetary operating system

03:27.575 --> 03:29.610
to need some maintenance
every once in a while.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.279
No one's judging you.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.880
Ah. Thank you.
It's just embarrassing.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.882
I've been fine for a millennia,

03:34.915 --> 03:37.351
but now I can't even control
my monsoon seasons.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.353
Why don't I just pop
your control panel

03:39.387 --> 03:41.454
and take a look
at your circuits?

03:43.357 --> 03:46.293
I'm sure we can have you
up and running in no time.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.296
Captain, we have engineers

03:48.329 --> 03:49.930
-who could...
-Stand down, Jack.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.500
I minored in archaic technology
back at the Academy.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.435
I think I've got this.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.204
Thank you, Captain.
I don't deserve this treatment.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.573
I hope this isn't taking you
away from more important work.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.342
No. (scoffs) Not at all.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.744
We needed to stop in
and retrofit the power relay

04:03.777 --> 04:06.547
Starfleet installed
during first contact anyway.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.916
I've got one of my lieutenants
on that now.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.420
BOIMLER:
Ooh, this is it.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.754
Your first away mission
as a commander.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.523
No big deal. You've got this.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.658
You are boss Boimler,
and you're gonna nail...

04:17.690 --> 04:19.726
-Lieutenant Boimler.
-What?! I mean, hi.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.928
-I mean, uh... yes, T'Lyn?
-Your team is waiting.

04:21.962 --> 04:25.299
Have you completed
your confidence-boosting ritual?

04:25.332 --> 04:26.834
Oh, that's not what I was doing.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.437
I was just, uh, running
a last-minute check of supplies.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.271
Has everyone tested their comms?

04:31.305 --> 04:32.673
-(feedback squeals)
-(echoing): Boimler to T'Lyn.
Yah!

04:32.706 --> 04:34.241
All equipment is
in adequate condition

04:34.274 --> 04:35.943
to accomplish our errand.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.645
It's not an errand,
it's a mission.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.780
My first mission as commander.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.915
It's pretty cool, right?

04:41.949 --> 04:44.518
-Perhaps we should proceed.
-(clears throat)

04:44.552 --> 04:45.953
Ensigns, at attention.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.389
This is a cut-and-dry
power terminal upgrade.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.758
If you have any questions,
don't hesitate to come to me

04:50.791 --> 04:52.693
or Provisional Lieutenant
Junior Grade T'Lyn,

04:52.726 --> 04:54.995
who's on site in case
any science stuff happens.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.731
Everything that has ever
occurred is science stuff.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.633
Oh. Uh, right.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.502
That went pretty well, I'd say.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.303
I do not know
to what you are referring.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.572
We have not started the repair.

05:04.605 --> 05:05.906
I mean, talking to my team.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.608
I've had good bosses
and bad ones.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.410
I just don't want
to repeat their mistakes.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.744
Your caution is warranted.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.546
Statistically, ensigns serving

05:12.580 --> 05:14.014
under recently promoted
commanders are more likely

05:14.047 --> 05:16.316
to experience death
and/or dismemberment.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.786
-Death?!
-Yes. And/or dismemberment.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.821
Well, luckily,
this mission's pretty tame.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.490
It's just
swapping out some terminals.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.425
The component pieces
are unstable

05:24.457 --> 05:25.959
-and could detonate
at any moment.
-(shrieks)

05:25.993 --> 05:28.462
The retrofit must be conducted
in precise order,

05:28.496 --> 05:30.464
or the terminal will explode.

05:30.498 --> 05:31.865
BOIMLER:
It's like disarming

05:31.899 --> 05:33.667
a building-sized bomb?

05:33.701 --> 05:35.703
The similarity
is not inaccurate.

05:35.736 --> 05:39.106
All right, gang.
Who's ready to be careful?

05:40.340 --> 05:41.942
TENDI:
I wonder
how Boimler's doing down there

05:41.975 --> 05:43.644
-on his mission.
-Oh, he's either doing great

05:43.677 --> 05:45.446
or super overthinking it
and getting sweaty.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.448
I don't know why.
Being a lieutenant junior grade

05:47.481 --> 05:49.683
doesn't seem too different
from being an ensign to me.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.419
Oh, okay. It's the same, huh?

05:51.452 --> 05:54.388
Well, what if I told you
we now have access to this?

05:54.422 --> 05:57.090
(gasps)
The anomaly storage room?

05:57.124 --> 06:01.161
Yup! Anything
that requires further study

06:01.194 --> 06:03.363
or might need to be returned
to its previous entity

06:03.397 --> 06:04.865
is kept right here.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.834
That's the hat that turned
Billups into a church tower.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.569
I wouldn't even
authorize myself for this.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.538
-A lot of it is dangerous.
-Aah! Don't touch that!

06:10.571 --> 06:12.573
Do you want your head
to fall off and skitter away?

06:12.606 --> 06:14.542
-Greetings and salutations!
-(Rutherford gasps)

06:14.575 --> 06:17.344
(groans) A Betazoid gift box.
Things creep me out.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.681
(gibbering)

06:20.714 --> 06:21.782
Why?

06:21.815 --> 06:23.684
This is a message
for Rutherford.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.086
I don't want to be in this roo.
I want to live in your quarter.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.088
Oh, uh, no, thank you.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.023
Is this guy sentient?

06:30.057 --> 06:32.392
No, they-they just tend to
pick up phrases they overhear.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.728
Eat a bag of Borg,
(bleep) mother(bleep).

06:34.762 --> 06:36.063
I didn't know
that Dr. T'Ana came in here.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.899
Oh, no way.
It's the Wadi Chula game.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.133
The one that traps you inside

06:40.167 --> 06:41.802
until you solve
its annoying challenges.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.003
Oh, hell yeah. The one with,
like, the pastel triangles

06:43.036 --> 06:44.772
and the little girl
doing hopscotch,

06:44.805 --> 06:47.541
and everybody's like...
* Allamalay lemon meringue. *

06:47.575 --> 06:49.009
DIRK:
Lieutenants Tendi, Mariner
and Rutherford,

06:49.042 --> 06:51.011
report to the isolinear
chip junction immediately.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.713
On the way.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.615
Ugh. I thought we had
the afternoon to ourselves.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.717
I told you it didn't feel too
different from being an ensign.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.118
At least this'll be
something interesting.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.221
No more mindless,
repetitive tasks for us.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.791
Took you long enough.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.392
I need you three
to scan each and every one

07:05.425 --> 07:07.394
of these isolinear chips
by hand.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.096
What?! But there are
thousands of them.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.565
Yeah, and there's
a .015% deviation

07:11.599 --> 07:13.166
in the fault sensor,
which is why

07:13.200 --> 07:14.935
it needs to be done by hand.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.837
Can't it just wait
until we repair the sensor?

07:16.870 --> 07:18.171
Wow. Why didn't I think of that?

07:18.205 --> 07:19.940
Oh, right, I did.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.109
But the sensor detected
a single malfunctioning chip

07:22.142 --> 07:23.644
before it went down.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.112
You three need to find it.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.047
This isn't so bad.
Ooh, maybe we can sing a song...

07:27.080 --> 07:29.683
Once an hour, the room fills
with nitrogen coolant,

07:29.717 --> 07:31.418
so keep your breathers handy.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.687
The chips can get scalding hot,
so watch out for that.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.756
Oh, and Billups' ferret
got out this morning

07:35.789 --> 07:37.791
so report to him
if it bites you.

07:37.825 --> 07:40.159
-Lancelot's in here?!
Ah! (whimpering)
-(Lancelot squeaks)

07:40.193 --> 07:43.463
Okay, you were right.
This is feeling pretty ensign-y.

07:43.497 --> 07:44.898
Huh. It doesn't make any sense.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.900
This is ensign work.

07:46.933 --> 07:48.702
(gasps)
Maybe even cadet.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.771
On Orion, older pirates
would haze new recruits

07:50.804 --> 07:52.506
by making them
do worthless tasks,

07:52.540 --> 07:54.508
like clean the door panels
with their tongues.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.143
-You think Dirk's hazing us?
-What's hazing?

07:56.176 --> 07:57.845
It's a prank dressed up
as team-building

07:57.878 --> 07:59.580
that nobody really likes.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.248
Well, that doesn't sound
very Starfleet.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.016
Yeah, I got to agree
with Ruthie on this one.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.753
There is no way senior officers
would haze a lieutenant.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.888
You're right.
They have too much character.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.890
(scoffs)
What? No, no.
They're not cool enough.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.726
This is just an annoying job
given to us by an annoying guy.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.529
(laughs)
Yeah, I'm probably overreacting.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.599
FREEMAN:
Hmm.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.967
Well, nothing seems to be wrong

08:20.000 --> 08:21.535
with your hardware.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.970
Do you mind if I take a look
at your terminal?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.672
Of course.
Feel free to dig around.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.574
(beeping)

08:26.607 --> 08:28.942
Ah, I think I see the problem.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.911
Your operating system's
out of date.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.511
That would explain it.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.213
There was that weekend
where my designers evolved

08:34.246 --> 08:36.750
into fifth-dimensional energy
beings and left me on my own.

08:36.784 --> 08:37.918
When was my last update?

08:37.951 --> 08:40.087
Six million and seven years ago.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.621
Ah, that was a good year.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.155
Really good harvest season.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.093
Huh. Hang tight, I'll get you
caught up with this update,

08:46.126 --> 08:48.228
and it should clear things
right up.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.631
Thank you, Captain.
You've saved us.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.700
It'll be nice to get back
to my old, helpful self

08:52.733 --> 08:55.703
af-af-after...
after, after, after, after,

08:55.736 --> 08:57.938
-(high-pitched):
After, after, after, after...
-Vexilon?

08:57.971 --> 09:00.641
(rapid, high-pitched): After,
after, after, after, after...

09:00.674 --> 09:02.242
-(rumbling)
-RANSOM: Uh, Captain?

09:02.275 --> 09:04.678
Did that update require
a shutdown?

09:04.712 --> 09:06.714
It wasn't supposed to.

09:08.315 --> 09:11.151
(clinking)

09:11.184 --> 09:13.286
(yelling)

09:15.656 --> 09:16.657
(thunder crashing)

09:24.765 --> 09:26.166
-(wind whistling)
-All right, gang.

09:26.199 --> 09:29.169
Just remember,
the name of the game is safety.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.838
-(crashing)
-(Boimler gasps)

09:30.871 --> 09:32.740
Okay, also, hurry.
Safety and speed.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.107
Lieutenant,
these power cylinders

09:34.141 --> 09:35.676
are extremely volatile.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.711
Are you certain
speed is necessary?

09:37.745 --> 09:38.846
Something's going on
with the weather,

09:38.879 --> 09:40.547
and these guys are pros.
They'll be...

09:40.580 --> 09:43.083
-Taylor, what are you doing?
-Um, reaching for
the first clamp?

09:43.116 --> 09:45.052
Love the initiative,
but your angle is all off.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.621
I need 90 degrees, not 80.
But no worries.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.757
I probably did
a bad job explaining

09:49.790 --> 09:51.792
how deadly these bomb tubes are.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.894
-Okay.
-Stop! Stop! Stop.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.629
You know what? Why-why don't I
show you how to do one?

09:55.663 --> 09:56.964
Then you guys can do the rest.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.899
But doesn't each one take
three people, sir?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.600
Oh, no, no, no, you don't have

10:00.634 --> 10:02.636
to do that whole "sir" thing
with me. I'm chill.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.805
Call me Bradward or Boims
or something.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.607
Doesn't this take
three people, Bradward?

10:07.641 --> 10:09.276
Technically, yes,
but I think I should show you

10:09.309 --> 10:11.044
how to do it right,
just on this first one.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.680
So you have four subsponders
in the corners

10:12.713 --> 10:14.581
that interface with
the ion generator in the center,

10:14.614 --> 10:16.583
which self-stabilizes
the reaction.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.786
If broken in the wrong order,
the container will explode,

10:18.819 --> 10:20.821
so you have to be careful
as you remove each one...

10:20.854 --> 10:22.155
-(grunts) Got it.
-(clanks)

10:22.189 --> 10:23.691
Then repeat that three times.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.793
-(grunting)
-(clanking)

10:25.826 --> 10:27.260
Then you rotate the old cylinder

10:27.294 --> 10:29.029
until you feel
the latch disengage,

10:29.062 --> 10:30.964
-at which point
you carefully remove it.
-(rolling thunder)

10:30.998 --> 10:32.766
Now it's very important
to keep it upright

10:32.800 --> 10:34.234
and lift with your knees,
not your back, because

10:34.267 --> 10:35.803
you really don't want
back pain, and that's...

10:35.836 --> 10:37.838
-(wind whistling)
-(rolling thunder)

10:37.871 --> 10:39.740
...why you put it in the taupe
bin and not the magenta bin.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.141
Got it?

10:41.174 --> 10:44.044
-I don't think we did.
-Maybe we could try it?

10:44.077 --> 10:45.312
Okay, not a big deal.
Let me just

10:45.345 --> 10:47.280
pop another quick demo for you.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.782
-(groans)
-(Boimler grunting)

10:48.816 --> 10:50.150
When are we going to get
to do some of the mission?

10:50.183 --> 10:51.752
-(clinking)
-BOIMLER: Whoa.

10:51.785 --> 10:55.622
-(beeping)
-RUTHERFORD: Mm, mm, mm, mm, m.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.090
(Rutherford gasps,
Lancelot squeaks)

10:57.124 --> 11:00.393
Lancelot!
(whimpering)

11:00.427 --> 11:03.096
Ow! Hot! Aah!

11:03.130 --> 11:04.798
How many more
of these things are there?

11:04.832 --> 11:06.767
Ugh. Rutherford's got
the last couple.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.136
You ever notice that it's always
the last chip you test?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.238
Just scan it.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.773
-No, that's not right.
-(Tendi grunts)

11:12.806 --> 11:14.775
-(growls)
-But we tested every chip.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.644
-Rutherford, make it make sense.
-I can't. It has to be this one.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.912
How's it going in here,
Lieutenants?

11:18.946 --> 11:20.247
Wow. You all look beat.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.949
Oh, didn't know
scanning could be so taxing.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.752
-Ugh!
-Uh, sir, look,
we've scanned every chip.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.119
They're all fine.

11:26.153 --> 11:30.023
Hmm. Every chip?
Even the second layer?

11:33.460 --> 11:35.362
Why didn't you tell us
about all these?!

11:35.395 --> 11:37.164
I don't know. The hidden button
seemed obvious.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.733
Anyway, these are twice as hot,
so you'll want to use tongs,

11:39.767 --> 11:41.068
which makes it twice as hard.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.870
-(squeaks)
-Aah! Lancelot!

11:42.903 --> 11:44.337
Leave me alone!
I don't have any meat!

11:44.371 --> 11:47.174
Billups,
I've got eyes on Lancelot.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.744
-(alarm blaring)
-"The hidden button
seemed obvious."

11:50.778 --> 11:52.746
Oh, this is definitely hazing.
So much for character.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.748
Ouch!
Yeah, I think you're right.

11:54.782 --> 11:57.751
Hey, how'd you deal with this
kind of thing back on Orion?

11:57.785 --> 11:59.152
Blindfolded saber fight.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.720
Okay, I want
to hear more about that,

12:00.754 --> 12:02.790
but I think
I have a less stabby solution.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.162
(squeaking)

12:13.767 --> 12:15.735
Okay, okay, no big deal.

12:15.769 --> 12:18.238
Just a frozen progress bar

12:18.271 --> 12:20.440
and some crazy day-night stuff.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.910
Now I think the ancient manual
is saying

12:22.943 --> 12:25.412
to press this?

12:25.445 --> 12:28.148
-(whirring)
-Oh, yeah.
-Ha-ha!

12:28.181 --> 12:30.017
-(low beep)
-Oh.
-Oh.

12:30.050 --> 12:33.020
(grunts) Freeman to Billups.
Beam down here immediately.

12:35.823 --> 12:38.391
Ugh. Sorry, Captain. I'm-I'm
having a hard time today.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.293
Lancelot got out when I was
cleaning his snuggle tower,

12:40.327 --> 12:43.864
and I just... Wow!
This is a classic setup.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.066
Is it a Unotronic? (laughs)

12:46.099 --> 12:47.868
That-that kills in engineering.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.904
Billups, this isn't the time
for your computer comedy.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.040
And we're sure
we want to turn it back on?

12:53.073 --> 12:54.808
It's not, like, crushing the
will of the locals or anything?

12:54.842 --> 12:57.811
-(gasps) We love Vexilon.
-FREEMAN: No.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.947
It's a nice one. We're fine.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.949
Is it safe
to jiggle his power source?

13:01.982 --> 13:03.283
-I mean, you'd be surprised...
-"Safe."

13:03.316 --> 13:04.918
Excellent thinking, Commander.

13:04.952 --> 13:08.521
Aha! A lot
of these ancient computers had

13:08.555 --> 13:10.390
a safe mode for debugging.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.459
Now, if I can just
activate it...

13:12.492 --> 13:14.061
(grunts)
There.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.428
-(whirring)
-(Freeman laughs)

13:15.462 --> 13:17.430
That got rid
of the stalled update.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.833
-(explosive rumble)
-Yeah.
-Captain,

13:19.867 --> 13:22.435
are you sure this is safe mode
and not a full reboot?

13:22.469 --> 13:23.503
Uh...

13:23.536 --> 13:25.138
-I am Vexilon.
-Oh!

13:25.172 --> 13:26.806
Welcome to your new world.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.441
I will now re-genesis
installation

13:28.475 --> 13:30.010
to default settings.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.879
Initiating fjords.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.981
-Distributing miasma.
-(thunder cracks)

13:34.014 --> 13:37.017
Stirring primordial ooze.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.189
(panting)

13:42.222 --> 13:43.823
(gasps)

13:46.593 --> 13:47.995
(high-pitched whimpering)

13:48.028 --> 13:49.329
Doing one more myself
should really

13:49.362 --> 13:50.898
teach you guys how to do this.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.266
-There's only one left.
-Shouldn't we help?

13:53.300 --> 13:54.935
It's getting
really crazy out there.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.336
Just keep doing
what you're doing!

13:56.369 --> 13:58.405
-(grunting)
-We're not doing anything.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.974
Lieutenant Boimler,
your ensigns have a point.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.343
Leading by example has proven
to be inefficient.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.812
I only have one left, and we all
get out of here alive.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.580
-(grunting)
-Freeman to Lieutenant Boimler.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.883
(clears throat)
Go ahead, Captain.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.084
Has your team finished
the retrofit?

14:11.118 --> 14:12.352
We're almost finished here, si.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.322
Don't. I need you
to put it back the way it was.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.090
But, Captain, it's getting
pretty apocalyptic out here.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.491
I know.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.394
According to this scroll we
found in an ancient junk drawer,

14:21.428 --> 14:23.563
Vexilon can force a restart

14:23.596 --> 14:26.900
if we reroute its primary power
to your station.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.936
-But the station's outdated.
-We have to get this done

14:28.969 --> 14:31.138
before the anaerobic bacteria
is dispersed.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.506
No problem. Just gonna quickly
undo all the work I just did.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.976
-Another learning experience
for you.
-(grunting)

14:37.010 --> 14:38.578
Fascinating.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.348
A mountain or possibly a volcano
has appeared.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.118
Ah. It is a volcano.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.653
(panting)

14:52.993 --> 14:54.928
RUTHERFORD:
Are you sure we shouldn't just
ask him to stop hazing us?

14:54.962 --> 14:56.563
No, Mariner's right.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.299
-Hazers only respect hazing.
-That's why we trap him

14:59.332 --> 15:01.501
in the Wadi game and let him
marinate in there for a bit

15:01.534 --> 15:03.903
-while the Betazoid gift box
screams at him.
-(laughs)

15:03.937 --> 15:05.438
I guess he'll have
to respect us after this.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.374
I know I would,
and I already did.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.076
Quick, let's get out of here.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.244
-(laughter)
-Whoa.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.545
-(gasps)
-(laughter)

15:14.147 --> 15:15.382
(grunts, gasps)

15:15.415 --> 15:17.150
Oh, hey. Done already?

15:17.184 --> 15:18.551
Ha. Totally, my man.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.653
No error'ed chips.
All good to go.

15:20.687 --> 15:24.424
Oh, thank God. I can't tell you
how glad I am to hear that.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.959
Oh, really? Why?

15:25.993 --> 15:28.061
Those isolinear chips run some

15:28.095 --> 15:29.963
of the most important systems
on the ship.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.898
If one fails, it could be fatal.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.500
Yeah, but, not...
like, not really?

15:33.533 --> 15:34.667
Yes, really.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.970
Even one going down
could be catastrophic.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.438
Thank you so much
for taking that on.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.574
-I really appreciate it.
-Come on. If it was important,

15:41.608 --> 15:43.276
why wouldn't you have done it
yourself?

15:43.310 --> 15:45.445
I would have. I...

15:45.478 --> 15:48.615
Dr. Migleemo says acceptance
is the road to healing.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.351
How familiar are you
with the Wadi Chula game?

15:51.384 --> 15:52.952
We put one in...

15:52.986 --> 15:54.354
-I-I mean, uh, the what now?
-It's a game

15:54.387 --> 15:56.656
that traps a user
in a little (bleep) dimension

15:56.689 --> 15:58.658
until they can complete
its challenges.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.428
When I was a kid, I got trapped
in one for a month.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.964
I was...
too dumb to work my way out.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.666
-(sniffles)
-Oh, no, you weren't dumb.

16:06.699 --> 16:10.603
That experience,
that torture colored my life.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.673
I can't go near the anomaly room
without having a panic attack

16:13.706 --> 16:15.942
because one of those games is
on the ship.

16:15.975 --> 16:20.380
I should have helped you today,
but all those glowing chips...

16:20.413 --> 16:24.051
remind me too much
of the... game.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.153
-Oh, God.
-Oh, yes.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.687
Oh, thank you for sharing,
so much,

16:27.720 --> 16:29.956
and I am glad to be a part
of your journey.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.524
You know, maybe, oh,
would it cheer you up to talk

16:31.558 --> 16:33.726
about that music
that you like so much?

16:33.760 --> 16:35.562
Tellarite slop jazz?

16:35.595 --> 16:37.464
Yes! Oh, yes, that's it.
Okay, you've rambled

16:37.497 --> 16:39.299
about that at length before.
Go fix it.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.534
Oh, I could go on
about slop jazz forever.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.104
You know, everybody thinks the
slops is about how much spit

16:44.137 --> 16:45.572
-you can get to drip out
of the nozzle...
-Uh-huh, uh-huh.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.107
...but it's really
about the brizzles flarps.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.076
Yeah, you know, it sounds wet,
and that is what I like.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.410
Please continue.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.647
-(beeping)
-(whimpering)

16:54.681 --> 16:58.751
-Sir, please let us help.
-Stay away from the blast zone.

16:58.785 --> 17:01.221
Just five or six more trips.
Oh. Oh, no!

17:02.189 --> 17:03.723
This is quite enough,
Lieutenant.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.458
You will allow the ensigns
to assist you.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.560
-(groaning)
-But I don't, uh...

17:07.594 --> 17:10.396
(yelling)

17:10.430 --> 17:12.232
-Whoa!
-It is admirable

17:12.265 --> 17:14.032
that you care
for the safety of your team,

17:14.067 --> 17:16.636
but danger is an accepted risk
of Starfleet duty.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.070
No, I know. It's not that.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.073
If you have not been acting
in their defense,

17:20.107 --> 17:22.642
then what has caused
your unpredictable behavior?

17:22.675 --> 17:24.344
(sighs)

17:24.377 --> 17:26.346
Last week
I was an ensign with them,

17:26.378 --> 17:29.382
and now, randomly, I'm supposed
to tell them what to do?

17:29.416 --> 17:31.551
What gives me the right
to put my peers

17:31.584 --> 17:33.353
in a position
where they could die?

17:33.386 --> 17:35.188
Your promotion was not random.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.723
I studied your records
and mission logs

17:36.756 --> 17:38.325
before our departure.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.493
The commander was correct
to promote you.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.195
Your work is exemplary.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.663
Look at your team.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.798
-(grunting)
-They deserve your trust,

17:45.832 --> 17:48.668
just as Commander Ransom
trusted you.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.470
They could all have greatness
in them.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.039
That remains to be seen,
but if you do not order them

17:53.072 --> 17:55.442
to aid in the unloading
of these power cylinders,

17:55.475 --> 17:57.310
we will all perish.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.546
The files really said I'm great?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.848
They thoroughly describe
your strengths and shortcomings.

18:01.881 --> 18:05.252
You're right. I have
to let them do their jobs.

18:05.285 --> 18:08.788
T'Lyn says I got to put you guys
in danger, so let's do this.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.323
-(panting)
-That is not how

18:10.357 --> 18:12.159
I would have communicated
the lesson.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.793
Everybody up.
We've worked together for years.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.362
I trust you.
Big Merp, you're with me.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.796
We're unloading the transport.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.465
Taylor and Meredith,
claim a terminal

18:18.498 --> 18:19.799
and get those power cylinders
reattached.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.501
Nobody's exploding today.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.635
-On it, sir.
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.643
-(grunting)
-(beeping)

18:33.513 --> 18:34.747
(whimpers)

18:34.781 --> 18:36.816
Aah! Oh, no. Oh.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.252
-(exclaims)
-Fiddle-de-dah!

18:39.286 --> 18:42.222
(grunts, gasps)
No, no, no, no, no!

18:42.255 --> 18:44.624
Oh, man, am I in the game?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.493
Move along home.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.595
-Allamaraine, count to four.
-(grunts)

18:48.628 --> 18:50.730
But flizz bop is really
more of a bastardization

18:50.763 --> 18:53.200
of modal skuzz.
Uh, this isn't boring, is it?

18:53.233 --> 18:55.435
Boring? What? How could
a musical lecture be boring?

18:55.468 --> 18:57.136
Okay, so...

18:57.170 --> 18:58.805
BOTH:
Allamaraine, then three more.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.440
-Allamaraine, if you can see.
-Allamaraine, then three more.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.908
Faster, mother(bleep).

19:01.941 --> 19:02.842
-Allamaraine.
-Allamaraine,
you'll come with me.

19:02.875 --> 19:03.843
Later, little girl.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.746
(grunting)

19:06.779 --> 19:09.115
Best of them was probably
Fats B'zirtak,

19:09.148 --> 19:10.883
but he overdosed
on Ketracel-white.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.752
Yeah, that (bleep)
will mess you up.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.423
-You have progressed to...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, shap four.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.857
Open the door, come on.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.659
(sighing):
Oh.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.296
(beeping)

19:23.330 --> 19:24.631
-Ha!
-(beep)

19:24.664 --> 19:25.765
Got your ass!

19:27.334 --> 19:29.502
DIRK:
Which takes us up

19:29.536 --> 19:31.438
-to 2380...
-Yeah. Yes.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.206
-Well, I should probably
get back to my room.
-What?

19:33.240 --> 19:34.541
Migleemo's coming over
to help me

19:34.574 --> 19:35.742
-sort through my trust issues.
-Oh. Wait!

19:35.775 --> 19:37.810
Don't you want
to list some more stuff at me?

19:37.844 --> 19:39.512
We can meet up after.
This has been fun.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.913
(groans)

19:40.947 --> 19:43.316
This looks dangerous.
Don't fall, Rutherford.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.818
We got to! (screams)

19:46.853 --> 19:49.256
(yells)
Whoa! Wha...?!

19:49.289 --> 19:52.292
-(grunts)
-What? Where am I?

19:52.325 --> 19:54.193
Was that an entire
simulated life?

19:54.227 --> 19:55.528
Sorry about that.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.464
(crying):
I miss my wife.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.631
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

19:58.665 --> 19:59.966
Who are your top three
sizzle horn players?

20:01.934 --> 20:03.270
Stop if you like music!

20:04.704 --> 20:06.539
-Ugh! Dirk, wait!
-Huh?

20:06.573 --> 20:07.940
Someone told me there's no
difference between slop jazz

20:07.974 --> 20:10.277
-and skuzz blues!
-What?!

20:10.310 --> 20:12.211
Whoever told you that
is a fool.

20:12.245 --> 20:15.348
Oh, crap. I forgot. I'm meeting
Migleemo in his office.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.784
Ha! I had no reason
to come back here for hours.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.589
-(groans)
-(sighs)

20:24.223 --> 20:25.392
-(groans)
-Where are we at
with those cylinders?

20:25.425 --> 20:26.459
-Complete!
-Complete!

20:26.493 --> 20:27.694
Securing my final clamp!

20:27.727 --> 20:30.330
Taylor, Merp,
assume the rotational stance.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.231
-(rumbling)
-(gasps, yells)

20:32.265 --> 20:34.000
-(grunts) I got this.
-(panting)

20:36.369 --> 20:38.338
Rotate... now!

20:39.706 --> 20:41.808
-Captain, power's up!
-Keep the engine running

20:41.841 --> 20:44.744
-while I hack
this megastructure.
-VEXILON: What happened?

20:44.777 --> 20:47.380
Oh, no, did I shut down?
Oh, I'm a terrible host.

20:47.414 --> 20:50.617
Vexilon, focus. I need you
to stop the planetary re-genesis

20:50.650 --> 20:52.285
before we all get killed.

20:52.319 --> 20:54.621
Yes, of course. I'm so sorry.
This is so embarrassing.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.889
Hey, give me a sec.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.460
BOIMLER:
Great work, team.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.629
Now let's get
on the shuttle before...

21:02.662 --> 21:04.797
-(alarm sounding)
-Aah, the turbine's overheating!

21:04.831 --> 21:06.466
Uh, Captain,
we've got a problem.

21:06.499 --> 21:07.800
FREEMAN: We're almost done.
I need more time.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.436
-Everyone out of here.
-No! We can help.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.938
Ensign, the lieutenant
gave you an order.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.981
Okay, almost... there.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.617
Re-genesis is deactivating.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.353
Lieutenant Boimler,
shut it down.

21:26.386 --> 21:27.620
On it, Captain.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.429
(gasping)

21:36.463 --> 21:38.565
-Bradward, no!
-(crying)
-(vomiting)

21:38.598 --> 21:40.367
The lieutenant junior grade

21:40.400 --> 21:44.003
first mission mortality rate...
appears to be accurate.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.075
(gasps)

21:51.911 --> 21:54.547
(thunder cracking)

21:58.785 --> 22:00.887
Uh... hi?

22:00.920 --> 22:03.456
(speaking Koala)

22:05.425 --> 22:08.327
Aah! Get it off! Get it off me!
(coughing)

22:08.361 --> 22:11.464
Holy (bleep),
I can't believe that worked.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.999
Did we complete the mission?

22:13.032 --> 22:15.001
Yes, you were the only fatality.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.003
(groans)
Yup, feels like it.

22:17.036 --> 22:19.372
The captain believes
the updated operating system

22:19.406 --> 22:21.708
will keep the population safe
for over a thousand years.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.643
Your mission was a success.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.011
Well done, Mr. Boimler.

22:25.044 --> 22:26.746
You never forget
your first death.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.015
Only more and more dangerous
missions from here on out.

22:29.048 --> 22:31.050
(laughs)

22:31.083 --> 22:34.587
Oh, come on, I just revived him.
Everybody out!

22:34.621 --> 22:37.890
Give me 30cc's of whatever just
worked a (bleep) minute ago.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.960
TENDI:
I am so glad we didn't get Dirk
sucked into the game.

22:40.993 --> 22:43.530
-The guy seems traumatized.
-He's working on it, though.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.097
Under that grouchy exterior
is a guy just trying

22:45.131 --> 22:47.600
-to find some peace.
-I wish he could find it

22:47.634 --> 22:49.335
-without sending me
all these jazz albums.
-(jazz playing)

22:49.368 --> 22:51.938
I like them, and it's bugging
me. I am not a jazz person.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.506
Ugh. I feel silly,

22:53.540 --> 22:55.708
thinking a Starfleet officer
would ever haze someone.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.777
Hmm. Sorry I ever brought it up.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.078
Next time,
we assume the best in people.

22:59.111 --> 23:00.480
Hear! Hear!

23:00.513 --> 23:03.483
They bought
the Wadi game story, huh?

23:03.516 --> 23:05.552
Oh, yeah. Told them I was stuck
in there for a month.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.086
(laughs)

23:07.119 --> 23:09.088
(quietly):
Hey, little guy.
Go get Rutherford.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.023
Aah! Lancelot! (whimpering)

23:11.057 --> 23:13.426
Oh, new lieutenants
give me life.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.595
RUTHERFORD:
Good weasel. Nice weasel.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.664
