WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.073 --> 00:09.042
Newcastle done.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.177
Cancun done.

00:11.244 --> 00:13.079
Australia, you're getting done.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.983
The Geordies are going Down Under.
To Australia!

00:17.050 --> 00:19.986
And deep into the bush.
(all scream)

00:21.921 --> 00:24.324
Throw another shrimp on the barbie.

00:25.725 --> 00:27.527
This one's gonna be the best yet.

00:29.562 --> 00:32.265
This is a fucking war!

00:32.332 --> 00:34.100
Vicky's tashing on too much.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.469
She's taking herself
away from the group.

00:44.411 --> 00:47.814
Finally, we can have
sexual intercourse.

00:49.682 --> 00:50.984
(laughs)

00:51.050 --> 00:53.853
I had a chance to move on
and be happy with someone,

00:53.920 --> 00:57.724
but instead I came to Australia
to live with someone who I hate.

00:58.992 --> 01:00.727
So we're drunk and we're in bed,

01:00.794 --> 01:03.663
and Scott's cock accidentally
falls into my mouth.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.364
Then I'm sucking on it. Fuck.

01:05.432 --> 01:07.600
How's Cock-a-tron?!

01:08.668 --> 01:10.003
(both laugh)

01:11.771 --> 01:13.940
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.975
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:16.042 --> 01:18.344
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.380
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:20.447 --> 01:22.382
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

01:22.449 --> 01:24.918
I'm fake, flirty and I've got FFs.

01:24.984 --> 01:27.120
The hardest graft I've done
is my hair.

01:27.187 --> 01:29.789
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:44.571 --> 01:48.608
Last night, everyone was having a go
at Vicky cos she's pulling too much.

01:48.675 --> 01:50.910
Vicky,
welcome to Gaz's fucking world.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.947
I hope that Holly's back tonight.

01:54.013 --> 01:57.116
Not bothered about Scott,
and I hope they haven't banged.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.821
Oh, my God, Gary!
Stop trying to touch her.

02:01.888 --> 02:04.691
Gary's scared that he's lost us
to another boy.

02:04.757 --> 02:06.693
cos I haven't went near him once.

02:18.204 --> 02:19.806
(groans)

02:25.144 --> 02:27.847
I had a dream that, like,
I sucked Scotty T off.

02:27.914 --> 02:30.016
No, that was reality.
I sucked him off.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.419
I don't know.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.788
It's canny awkward
between me and Holly,

02:35.855 --> 02:37.657
but she did not suck me off.

02:37.724 --> 02:42.896
Some people's talents are, like,
art or science or history.

02:42.962 --> 02:45.164
Mine just happens to be blow jobs.

02:45.231 --> 02:46.866
(groans)

02:46.933 --> 02:50.103
We've been messed around for days
by sheep-shagging Steve,

02:50.169 --> 02:53.306
but I'm buzzed he's letting me
go home, the fucking ball bag.

02:58.945 --> 03:03.016
Let's go on a road trip!

03:03.082 --> 03:05.785
We're going to see dolphins.
This is amazing!

03:05.852 --> 03:07.487
This is the best day of my life.

03:07.554 --> 03:11.024
Better than the day I got my period
and I felt like a woman.

03:15.929 --> 03:17.697
Everyone loves dolphins,

03:17.764 --> 03:20.166
cos dolphins have got
a massive blow hole.

03:20.233 --> 03:22.001
Just like women's vaginas.

03:24.170 --> 03:26.739
(shrieks)
Whoa!

03:26.806 --> 03:30.944
I know dolphins are the only other
animals that have sex for pleasure.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.112
Me and the dolphins are gonna get on.

03:39.319 --> 03:40.820
She's got Mitch now at home

03:40.887 --> 03:44.824
so she doesn't want anything to ever
look like she's befriending him.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.093
You can understand, though.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.129
Well, yeah, yeah.

03:50.196 --> 03:52.498
Obviously I miss him,
but not just that.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.668
Like, cos now it's...
cos it's been a while.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.437
I've been away for a while.

03:57.503 --> 04:02.308
And I feel like when, if I go back,
will things be the same?

04:02.375 --> 04:06.279
It doesn't feel weird telling him
how I was upset over another boy.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.520
I still care about Charlotte,

04:14.587 --> 04:17.557
and any advice she wants about lads,
I will help her.

04:22.895 --> 04:26.366
This is one of the nicest moments
me and Gary's ever shared.

04:26.432 --> 04:30.536
Thanks for the advice.
Hey, any time.

04:30.603 --> 04:34.040
Don't get me wrong, I'd love
me and Charlotte back in funny mode

04:34.107 --> 04:37.477
and be flirting while watching
these dolphins, but we're not.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.045
I'm treading on eggshells.

04:47.353 --> 04:50.123
Wonder what happened with everyone
last night.

04:52.225 --> 04:56.129
Maybe Gary's got
his pulling numbers up now.

04:57.964 --> 05:01.300
You gave him a chance, didn't you?
Yeah. Needs to.

05:01.367 --> 05:03.803
I've had enough now. I'm so bored.

05:03.870 --> 05:07.974
I'm hung-over, I'm tired, I'm filthy,
and I'm bored of being with Scott.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.275
I just want to get back.

05:10.309 --> 05:12.011
Come on then, let's go home.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.083
I can't remember.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.253
I was kinda pissed like.
I sort of remember, like...

05:25.591 --> 05:26.626
(laughs)

05:26.693 --> 05:28.161
Holly could be making it up.

05:28.227 --> 05:31.931
Normally after giving me a blow job,
she'd have a jaw like a crocodile.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.573
I'm getting very forgetful
these days with all the alcohol,

05:40.640 --> 05:43.609
so I'm not certain
that any blow job took place.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.011
(screams)

05:50.016 --> 05:52.051
Yay!

05:52.118 --> 05:53.252
Oh, my God!

05:53.319 --> 05:56.956
So we get back from the dolphins
and Scotty and Holly are back.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.526
(indistinct chatter)

06:00.593 --> 06:02.061
Scott's being so nice,

06:02.128 --> 06:05.765
which is making us feel really
guilty for being so nasty about him.

06:05.832 --> 06:10.269
But even when he has his nice times,
he still has his really bad ones,

06:10.336 --> 06:11.504
so I don't care.

06:14.607 --> 06:17.610
I've never been so relieved
to see this bunch of losers

06:17.677 --> 06:19.278
in my entire life.

06:19.345 --> 06:22.548
We want to ask the question
what's on everyone's mind.

06:22.615 --> 06:24.050
Did they bang or not?

06:25.952 --> 06:27.019
No.

06:27.086 --> 06:30.056
No, I didn't bang Holly.
And she didn't suck us off.

06:32.992 --> 06:34.093
Did ya?

06:34.160 --> 06:38.731
Scott's denying it all so badly, so
I hope they haven't done anything.

06:38.798 --> 06:41.801
If they had,
Holly looks like an absolute mug.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.803
(laughs)

06:52.311 --> 06:53.746
(laughs)

06:59.085 --> 07:00.386
(both laugh)

07:06.726 --> 07:07.727
(both laugh)

07:07.794 --> 07:11.564
Scott says he's done nothing with
Holly. He wouldn't tell us anyway.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.404
(both laugh)

07:22.775 --> 07:25.278
I'm so happy to be back,
be out with the family.

07:25.344 --> 07:28.981
I can't wait to get to Trademark
and go on a fucking piping mission

07:29.048 --> 07:31.083
and pipe everything in sight. Pipe!

07:36.856 --> 07:38.157
Buzzing for it tonight.

07:38.224 --> 07:41.360
We're all out and we're
hitting Trademark. Why-aye.

07:50.870 --> 07:53.739
I can't wait to get pissed
and rock the dance floor.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.542
The minute we walk in there,
everyone's buzzing,

07:56.609 --> 07:59.011
and wouldn't you know,
it's fucking dead.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.750
I'm thinking, "At least we're
the best looking people in here."

08:06.519 --> 08:08.888
There is literally
fucking no-one there.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.157
Not even a two out of ten. Nothing.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.594
What the fuck?
What's wrong with the club?

08:16.696 --> 08:18.197
When Scotty T dances,

08:18.264 --> 08:21.067
he reminds us of Mr Whippy
having a shit on a cone.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.768
What the fuck are these moves,

08:22.835 --> 08:25.671
and how on Earth
does he ever manage to pull?

08:27.640 --> 08:30.843
Scott's making much more of
an effort with us tonight.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.346
It's just such a shame
Gaz can't do the same.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.717
Gary is sitting by himself.

08:37.783 --> 08:41.187
What's his fucking problem?
Just cos there's no birds, Gaz,

08:41.254 --> 08:43.756
doesn't mean you can't have a laugh,
you tit.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.802
He cannot handle the fact
that tonight,

08:56.869 --> 09:00.039
we are all having a good time
with Scott. He's jealous.

09:26.799 --> 09:29.869
For some reason,
Australia brings out the worst in me.

09:37.176 --> 09:38.811
I knew this was coming.

09:38.878 --> 09:42.748
Holly had been sucking Scott off,
and now he's pulling other girls.

09:42.815 --> 09:46.585
She's getting jealous,
and this is where it all begins.

09:48.387 --> 09:51.490
The minute there's the opportunity
of something else,

09:51.557 --> 09:54.026
he's paying her
absolutely zero attention.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.329
This is like a red rag to a bull
for Holly.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.677
Holly's kicking off.

10:11.744 --> 10:15.047
As long as it's not about me,
I don't give a shit.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.821
All the girls
are putting out weird bribes,

10:21.887 --> 10:23.789
so we've decided not to pull.

10:23.856 --> 10:26.359
I'm just gonna go home
and bake a fucking cake.

10:26.425 --> 10:29.428
Scott has just got back
and he's pissed off the girls.

10:29.495 --> 10:31.998
Everything you do pisses them off.

10:34.266 --> 10:37.536
(all shouting)

10:37.603 --> 10:40.573
He fails to recognise
a genuine offer for a tasty snack.

10:42.875 --> 10:43.943
What a fucking tit.

10:44.010 --> 10:48.280
And it has been hard not trying to
speak to you, but I am your friend.

10:48.347 --> 10:51.450
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

10:53.119 --> 10:53.319
.

10:55.855 --> 10:56.055
.

11:09.568 --> 11:12.605
I've woke up this morning
and I feel like the anger stems

11:12.671 --> 11:16.108
from the fact that I was sent
on this stupid trip for no reason.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.578
I shouldn't have had
to go through that. No-one should.

11:19.645 --> 11:21.047
Just isn't fair.

11:23.649 --> 11:25.184
I knew this was coming.

11:25.251 --> 11:28.988
Holly had been sucking Scott off,
and now he's pulling other girls.

11:29.055 --> 11:32.691
She's getting jealous,
and this is where it all begins.

11:34.093 --> 11:37.029
Last night,
even Scotty T was getting involved.

11:37.096 --> 11:41.100
But Gaz had a face like a smacked
arse cos there was no birds to pull.

11:41.167 --> 11:44.070
Who the fuck needs birds
when you've got your family?

11:49.108 --> 11:50.176
Whoo!

11:50.242 --> 11:52.945
This is actually
the first time in Australia

11:53.012 --> 11:56.015
that we've all sat round
and had breakfast as a family.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.684
I feel like everything's
just too nice.

12:01.520 --> 12:05.491
I'm about to tell everyone my plan
for tonight. They're gonna love it.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.360
I'm gonna say one sentence
and it'll wind us all up.

12:08.427 --> 12:12.598
We're going to Oxford Art Factory,
which means a big fuck-off warehouse,

12:12.665 --> 12:15.868
for a fancy dress, Egyptian,
house music event.

12:15.935 --> 12:20.172
(all exclaim)

12:20.239 --> 12:23.576
We're going out in fancy dress
and it's all Egyptian themed.

12:23.642 --> 12:24.643
I cannot wait.

12:24.710 --> 12:28.481
We gotta dress up.
I love fancy dress!

12:28.547 --> 12:32.384
The first thing that you think of
when you think of Egypt? Romans.

12:32.451 --> 12:35.421
Is Aladdin Egyptian? Aladdin?

12:35.488 --> 12:37.389
(laughs)

12:43.729 --> 12:47.333
On a scale of one to ten,
what's your feelings?

12:47.399 --> 12:49.668
Are you nervous or excited?
Bit of both.

12:49.735 --> 12:51.971
This afternoon,
I've got my date with Dan

12:52.037 --> 12:54.340
and I'm feeling
a little bit anxious.

12:54.406 --> 12:58.611
Daytime dates are so much
more pressure than night-time ones.

12:58.677 --> 13:02.047
In broad daylight, you can see
everyone's imperfections.

13:02.114 --> 13:05.217
The whole no sex thing
is not for anyone else's benefit.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.920
It's for mine.
It just complicates everything.

13:07.987 --> 13:11.357
Once you start having sex, everyone
in this house is having sex.

13:11.423 --> 13:13.025
I am traditional.

13:13.092 --> 13:17.496
I'd like to date a person,
to get to know them. Maybes...

13:17.563 --> 13:21.400
have more than one encounter with
them before I just suck them off.

13:21.467 --> 13:26.205
Charlotte and Gary just having sex.
James and Holly just having sex.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.174
It's never just sex.

13:28.240 --> 13:32.144
I do understand Vicky when she says
that sex complicates everything.

13:32.211 --> 13:33.345
But look at me.

13:33.412 --> 13:36.248
I had sex on the first date
and I'm still with my lad.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.551
I'm not ready for anything serious.

13:39.785 --> 13:43.756
He's just really good to look at,
though, isn't he? Yeah.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.066
Hi.
Hello, sweetheart.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.001
You all right?
What's happening?

13:56.068 --> 13:58.971
I walk into the restaurant
and the minute I see Dan,

13:59.038 --> 14:02.308
I kind of get
this light feeling inside.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.777
I know that I do like him.

14:04.843 --> 14:08.414
Are you newly single or what?
Yeah, very new.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.884
Very, very new? Yeah.
How new is new?

14:11.951 --> 14:16.121
You're probably, like,
only the second person I've kissed.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.757
The conversation
quickly turns quite serious

14:18.824 --> 14:21.827
and Dan starts asking me
about my relationship history.

14:24.863 --> 14:26.665
Erm, yeah.

14:26.732 --> 14:29.134
Something about
his easy-going demeanour

14:29.201 --> 14:32.037
and his calming voice
just makes us want to open up.

14:32.104 --> 14:34.240
I was nervous
but you put us at ease.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.609
You're a really nice lad.
You too.

14:40.312 --> 14:44.583
When I first got to Australia, the
mere sight of a man made me nervous.

14:44.650 --> 14:47.653
The first time I tashed on,
I burst into fucking tears.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.721
And now look at us.

14:51.223 --> 14:54.927
'If that isn't me progressing and
moving on, I don't know what is.'

15:05.204 --> 15:07.940
I get Vicky upstairs
where no-one else can see her

15:08.007 --> 15:11.043
and drop the bombshell
that I'm taking the singles away

15:11.110 --> 15:14.013
on the best trip ever.
I just hope she keeps it a secret.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.190
Near the Gold Coast.

15:29.361 --> 15:31.864
I'm buzzing.
It's Australian Paradise.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.238
It might ruffle a few feathers

15:39.305 --> 15:42.741
for those people who are in
a relationship and aren't coming.

15:42.808 --> 15:44.209
So I'm keeping it a secret

15:44.276 --> 15:46.812
cos Holly can't keep a secret
to save her life.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.284
The way Vicky pulls,

15:52.351 --> 15:55.287
she's practically one of
the dream team anyway.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.625
(laughs)

16:06.632 --> 16:10.336
So tonight is fancy dress,
and that only means one thing.

16:10.402 --> 16:12.638
Everything has to be
ten times better.

16:12.705 --> 16:16.942
Bigger hair, bigger lashes,
more tan and more make-up.

16:17.009 --> 16:20.813
Everyone's in a good mood, seems
to be getting on so much better.

16:20.879 --> 16:23.482
I can't wait to get out,
it's gonna be massive.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.703
Everyone looks pinging'.
It's gonna be a mint night.

16:47.306 --> 16:50.175
Oh, my God, it's absolutely amazing!

16:58.584 --> 17:01.920
I've been here five minutes
and I can already see signs

17:01.987 --> 17:05.457
of the competition between
Scott and Gaz erupting again.

17:05.523 --> 17:06.959
I've got to talk to Scott.

17:10.194 --> 17:13.332
Scott has got to be careful.
If he keeps leading Holly on,

17:13.398 --> 17:16.167
it's gonna end up
like the way she was with James.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.575
Gary lately has been edging
closer and closer

17:23.642 --> 17:27.445
to try to playfully flirt with us,
and it's making us feel sick.

17:28.947 --> 17:31.183
Me and Charlotte
are on the right track.

17:31.250 --> 17:35.621
It was always gonna be difficult. But
we're taking it one step at a time

17:35.687 --> 17:37.389
and I do think we can be friends.

17:38.524 --> 17:41.260
Gary, fuck off, don't touch me.

17:41.326 --> 17:43.328
You had your chance, you blew it.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.664
Why don't you just
go play with yourself?

18:13.725 --> 18:15.527
Scott just doesn't get it.

18:15.594 --> 18:19.198
He can't get it through
his stupid, blonde, highlighted head

18:19.264 --> 18:21.733
that he's in the wrong. Thick!

18:33.512 --> 18:35.647
I don't know what them two
are on about,

18:35.714 --> 18:39.718
but I wouldn't live in this fucking
house if I didn't care about them.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.557
Everyone's had a mint night.

18:45.624 --> 18:49.428
It's been a class party, but I think
it's time we got out of Egypt.

18:50.562 --> 18:53.532
It's the end of the night,
I'm pissed as fuck.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.701
I'm hungry, I want a pie.

18:55.767 --> 18:58.770
But I also want to talk to Gary
about our trip tomorrow.

18:58.837 --> 19:01.173
So I suggest that me and him
go to a pie shop.

19:04.843 --> 19:07.179
Fuck off.
I don't want to go to a pie shop.

19:07.246 --> 19:09.948
To me, going to a pie shop
at the end of the night

19:10.015 --> 19:12.184
is just referring to I've been pied.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.886
Why do I want to go to a pie shop?

19:13.952 --> 19:17.122
I don't want to be put
in that category. I'm not going.

19:17.189 --> 19:20.325
(all shouting)

19:20.392 --> 19:23.028
Is Gary becoming
so obsessed with himself

19:23.095 --> 19:25.564
that he fails to recognise
a genuine offer

19:25.631 --> 19:27.933
for a tasty snack
at the end of the night?

19:33.605 --> 19:35.340
It all kicks off with Vicky,

19:35.407 --> 19:39.144
but then James dives in playing
the "protector of the girls" role.

19:39.211 --> 19:41.446
Fuck off,
this is between me and Vicky.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.882
Come and sit down!
Come and sit down!

19:43.949 --> 19:45.183
Gaz gets into the car,

19:45.250 --> 19:48.987
mouthing off about how he's gonna
get Vicky kicked out of the house.

19:49.054 --> 19:51.089
Who the fuck are you to say that?

19:51.156 --> 19:54.126
This whole argument
is about Gaz being too scared

19:54.192 --> 19:57.095
to go to a pie shop.
What a fucking tit.

19:57.162 --> 20:00.566
What's happened? What's he said?

20:00.632 --> 20:04.303
We'll probably just make up
in an hour and everything'll be fine.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.072
He's just using this as an excuse
to have a go at me.

20:14.112 --> 20:17.449
How dare he insinuate he's got
the power to get me kicked out?

20:17.516 --> 20:18.750
Who is he?

20:20.352 --> 20:21.820
I wanna confront Gaz.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.957
No-one should think they're better
than anyone else.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.729
This is an argument
that's been brewing for so long.

20:30.796 --> 20:33.498
Gary slagged James off,
James slagged Gary off.

20:33.565 --> 20:34.600
Get it over with!

20:40.472 --> 20:43.742
That was a sick night.
I've had the best night of my life.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.477
It just finished so badly.

20:45.544 --> 20:48.413
It was one of the best nights,
until we got in the car.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.683
If Gaz thinks he's bigger
than everyone in the house,

20:51.750 --> 20:53.852
he's got another thing coming.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.189
I think you two
need to fucking have it out, man.

20:57.255 --> 21:00.859
Trouble's brewing and it's not
in my bum-hole for once.

21:00.926 --> 21:04.129
I would rather have a conversation
with this apple juice.

21:04.196 --> 21:07.065
It would have a better crack.
Hi, how are you doing?

21:07.132 --> 21:10.302
Want to talk about birds?
Oh, no, you're all right.

21:10.369 --> 21:11.637
You have a good day.

21:11.703 --> 21:16.241
It's so pathetic and it just shows
how much Gary over thinks everything.

21:16.308 --> 21:20.579
It turns into a massive argument
over a bloody pie!

21:20.646 --> 21:21.847
Poor pies.

21:25.317 --> 21:27.519
What's the crack? What's happening?

21:30.122 --> 21:33.625
I get back to the house and I see
that James is in no way sedated.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.961
He is still furious
about what happened.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.864
He's going on about
how he can get you kicked out.

21:38.930 --> 21:42.467
I said, "Who are you to get
anyone kicked out of the house?"

21:42.534 --> 21:45.537
It's not just about Gary's eruption
and temper at me.

21:45.604 --> 21:48.407
It's about
a deep-seated horrible rivalry

21:48.473 --> 21:50.409
that's been going on for years.

21:50.475 --> 21:54.379
When you were going, "I'm fucking
standing up for you." I know you are.

21:54.446 --> 21:57.983
And he's told me in the car that
he was sorry and he didn't mean it.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.519
Now I just...
End of the day, I will sit down

22:00.585 --> 22:04.256
and I'll have a full-on conversation
with him about everything.

22:04.322 --> 22:08.126
Gaz has took it far too far this
time and everyone's pissed off.

22:08.193 --> 22:11.363
I hope you're listening,
cos I will tell you to your face.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.846
I couldn't really care
if I talk to James again or not.

22:27.913 --> 22:30.148
It wouldn't affect me
in the slightest.

22:30.215 --> 22:32.217
I'd go about my business with Scott.

22:32.284 --> 22:35.053
He can have his period conversations
with the girls

22:35.120 --> 22:38.290
and it wouldn't matter.
I'd still enjoy myself. Bothered.

22:38.356 --> 22:42.327
I'm not taking anyone's side.
I'm not taking anyone's side.

22:42.394 --> 22:44.863
No, I would never...
Why do you think I'm...

22:44.930 --> 22:48.734
I'm the only one sitting and talking
to you, you stupid fucking dick.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.469
No matter how much I hate him,

22:50.535 --> 22:52.804
no matter how nasty
I've been about him,

22:52.871 --> 22:56.174
no matter how much I agree
with everything James is saying,

22:56.241 --> 22:58.543
I can't let him sit up there
by himself.

22:58.610 --> 22:59.978
I am your friend, Gary.

23:00.045 --> 23:03.448
Even though I won't act like
I'm your friend, I am your friend.

23:03.515 --> 23:05.183
Actually, I am your friend.

23:05.250 --> 23:08.053
And I'll be here for you
no matter what.

23:08.120 --> 23:12.824
And it has been hard not trying to
speak to you, but I am your friend.

23:12.891 --> 23:15.093
(sobs)

23:16.795 --> 23:19.331
I'm a fantastic driver.
Is anyone hurt?

23:19.397 --> 23:21.566
We're going to Australian Paradise.

23:21.633 --> 23:23.301
(both) Oh, my God!

23:23.368 --> 23:24.636
(both argue)

23:26.304 --> 23:28.440
I'm tired of bullshit.

23:28.507 --> 23:30.542
We're having a good time. Hooray!

23:30.609 --> 23:33.078
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

23:34.946 --> 23:35.147
.

23:37.682 --> 23:37.883
.

23:51.463 --> 23:54.533
Last time Gary and James argued,
nothing was resolved.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.669
All the issues that made them
kick off are still there.

23:58.970 --> 24:00.705
I don't fucking know.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.176
If anyone's got to say anything
it needs to be said face to face.

24:04.242 --> 24:07.045
I'm in my room
and James is outside slagging us off.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.582
No way in holy hell I'm giving him
the satisfaction of a fight.

24:10.649 --> 24:14.786
It's kicked off tonight because he
thinks he's better than anyone else.

24:14.853 --> 24:16.721
James isn't gonna let this drop.

24:16.788 --> 24:19.825
He's saying that he can get Vicky
kicked out the house.

24:19.891 --> 24:21.993
What authority
has he got to do that?

24:22.994 --> 24:25.664
I don't understand
what James doesn't get.

24:28.533 --> 24:31.770
The only way this is heading
is to an angry confrontation.

24:31.837 --> 24:35.607
I can see it, Charlotte can see it,
James knows it, Gary must know it.

24:35.674 --> 24:38.210
This is going to fucking kick off.

24:38.276 --> 24:40.579
I'll talk to him now,
it's over now like.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.648
If an argument's happened,
it needs to be sorted.

24:43.715 --> 24:46.051
I want to talk to him now about it.

24:46.117 --> 24:48.720
What the fuck
has happened to this house?

24:49.855 --> 24:53.124
What's your crack? Come on.
James, don't...

24:53.191 --> 24:55.760
No-one's gonna fight,
don't worry about it.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.063
But I wanna hear
what you've got to say.

24:58.129 --> 25:00.131
I don't know who the kid
thinks he is,

25:00.198 --> 25:02.467
but he can't go on like this
in this house.

25:02.534 --> 25:04.269
Come on. Come on.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.973
Come on, little boy.
Come on, let's turn the lights on.

25:08.039 --> 25:09.040
What's the crack?

25:09.107 --> 25:12.377
Why do you think you've got
any power over anyone else here?

25:12.444 --> 25:15.447
Why do you think that you can say
about anyone else

25:15.513 --> 25:17.449
that you have the power over them?

25:17.515 --> 25:20.218
Why did you say that
you can get Vicky kicked out?

25:20.285 --> 25:22.320
It was only the house.
You said that.

25:22.387 --> 25:24.923
I can tell by his stance,
the look in his eye,

25:24.990 --> 25:27.259
the way he's talking,
he wants a fight.

25:27.325 --> 25:30.762
What gives you any right to
bad-mouth anyone else in the house?

25:30.829 --> 25:32.797
Everyone bad-mouths people.

25:32.864 --> 25:35.667
Who bad-mouths anyone?
Everyone in this house.

25:35.734 --> 25:39.504
(both arguing)

25:39.571 --> 25:41.706
I don't think I'm better than anyone.

25:41.773 --> 25:44.743
I can't believe this.
I'm trying to keep my calm.

25:44.809 --> 25:46.611
I've apologised to her already.

25:46.678 --> 25:49.014
I said I've said something,
blah, blah...

25:49.080 --> 25:51.816
(shouting, screaming)

25:51.883 --> 25:55.854
As soon as he clenched his fist,
I ducked, "Fuck off, mate. I'm off."

26:01.693 --> 26:03.295
I'm gutted it got this far,

26:03.361 --> 26:05.997
but all I was doing
was sticking up for my family.

26:06.064 --> 26:09.501
Gaz wouldn't understand cos
he's never tried to be part of it.

26:09.567 --> 26:11.136
He's calm, he's calm.

26:11.202 --> 26:12.604
James has gone for Gary,

26:12.671 --> 26:16.775
and I hope that this is one thing
Gary's not gonna get away with.

26:16.841 --> 26:20.011
He's such a fucking prick,
but why did I lose it?

26:20.078 --> 26:22.013
I'm gonna be in so much trouble now.

26:30.989 --> 26:32.857
I cannot have any more fights

26:32.924 --> 26:35.827
or I could lose my place
in this house permanently.

26:35.894 --> 26:37.896
And believe me, a fight with James

26:37.963 --> 26:40.999
is not worth losing
what I love more than anything.

26:48.606 --> 26:51.576
Their kick off better not ruin
my trip away, the mugs.

26:54.612 --> 26:56.648
I still think Gary's a knob.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.984
I can't help
but be worried about James.

26:59.050 --> 27:01.286
He stood up for me
and that's all I can see.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.488
And I hope he doesn't have
to pay for it.

27:19.571 --> 27:21.606
One thing I know about Geordie Shore

27:21.673 --> 27:24.642
is if you raise your hands
to anybody else, you're out.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.583
Today we're off
to the Whitsunday Islands.

27:31.649 --> 27:33.685
I'm getting out of this shithole.

27:43.128 --> 27:47.065
It's the morning after the night
before and this house feels awful.

27:47.132 --> 27:48.733
It all kicked off last night.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.336
The boys were arguing,
girls were involved.

27:51.403 --> 27:55.206
Gary and James don't get along,
Scott doesn't get along with anyone.

27:55.273 --> 27:58.676
What the fuck, man? We came
to Australia for everyone to bond,

27:58.743 --> 28:01.279
but instead,
everyone constantly argues.

28:01.346 --> 28:05.483
I just feel so, like, disrespectful
towards James and disloyal.

28:05.550 --> 28:07.786
Once again, King Gary has prevailed.

28:07.852 --> 28:11.289
He's pushed and manipulated people
into doing what he wanted.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.591
James has gone and he's still here.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.666
Yes, me and Vicky
did have a bit of beef.

28:21.733 --> 28:23.368
We argued. I was a bit of a dick.

28:23.435 --> 28:26.171
But me and Vicky
have known each other a long time.

28:26.237 --> 28:30.041
I'll apologise, we'll have a little
bit of banter and laugh it off.

28:33.878 --> 28:37.482
I still think Gary is a knob, but
I'm not gonna let him ruin my trip.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.617
We're going to Australian Paradise,

28:39.684 --> 28:42.287
we're gonna smash it
and have a brilliant time.

28:46.357 --> 28:48.893
Gary says that we're going
to Whitsundays.

28:48.960 --> 28:53.131
I'm like, "Eh, but it's not Sunday.
I don't understand."

28:53.198 --> 28:56.468
Basically, Holly, we are going
to Australian Paradise.

28:56.534 --> 28:58.036
(both) Whoo!

29:03.174 --> 29:06.144
There's just me, Sophie and Joel
left in the house.

29:06.211 --> 29:07.412
What the fuck?

29:07.479 --> 29:09.647
What the hell happened last night?

29:20.525 --> 29:22.527
I don't see how James and Gary

29:22.594 --> 29:25.130
can ever be friends again
after last night.

29:25.196 --> 29:27.398
I was saying to Gary,

29:27.465 --> 29:33.037
"Both of yous are in the wrong
and in the right in so many ways."

29:33.104 --> 29:36.908
So it's not that he's in the wrong
or you're in the wrong.

29:36.975 --> 29:41.012
You both have your reasons,
and you just need to resolve them.

29:41.079 --> 29:43.781
I hope the others aren't having fun,

29:43.848 --> 29:46.584
because Gary
was in the wrong as well,

29:46.651 --> 29:49.287
and why should he get treated
for his behaviour

29:49.354 --> 29:50.889
while James gets punished?

29:50.955 --> 29:53.291
We're the only ones
with positive energy?

29:53.358 --> 29:54.726
We can bring this back.

30:11.576 --> 30:14.345
I can't express enough
how nice this place is.

30:14.412 --> 30:16.614
It is like paradise.

30:19.250 --> 30:21.085
This place is absolute paradise.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.454
I'm so glad I'm here
and not stuck at home

30:23.521 --> 30:25.557
listening to Charlotte have a shit.

30:29.928 --> 30:30.929
Beach time!

30:30.995 --> 30:35.500
It's a nice day, so we're going
to the beach like proper Aussies.

30:35.567 --> 30:39.137
Oh, not that fucking car, man!

30:39.204 --> 30:41.940
It looks like if you kicked it,
it would cave in.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.808
Oh, for fuck's sake!

30:48.646 --> 30:49.948
I hate the ute!

30:50.014 --> 30:53.651
The day the ute dies and goes to
heaven will be the day I celebrate.

30:54.752 --> 30:57.455
Tree! Fuck! Fuck!

30:57.522 --> 30:59.757
Oh, my God!
This is the best day ever!

30:59.824 --> 31:01.926
Is everyone all right?
Is anyone hurt?

31:01.993 --> 31:04.028
No, I'm shaking like a leaf, though.

31:04.095 --> 31:07.332
I've hurt my knee when I got out
the car, not when we crashed.

31:07.398 --> 31:09.334
(laughter)

31:09.400 --> 31:10.868
I've got whiplash!

31:16.874 --> 31:18.576
Gary, for the sake of the trip,

31:18.643 --> 31:22.580
I've decided to put all the things
that happened last night behind us.

31:22.647 --> 31:25.883
Even after all the shit
that happened between me and Vicky,

31:25.950 --> 31:27.785
we're actually getting on well.

31:27.852 --> 31:30.855
Morale is high and we're having
a good time. Hooray!

31:32.557 --> 31:36.294
I feel like Gary is genuinely
contrite over what he said about me.

31:36.361 --> 31:38.596
For what happened
between him and James,

31:38.663 --> 31:40.598
he's not sorry in the slightest.

31:40.665 --> 31:43.401
Feels no remorse
because he wanted it to happen,

31:43.468 --> 31:46.571
and I feel deep down,
he's a little bit pleased.

31:46.638 --> 31:49.774
We're gonna do something first now
which will be wicked.

31:49.841 --> 31:51.876
You've crammed us with activities.

31:51.943 --> 31:54.245
You'll be nervous
but you'll be excited.

31:54.312 --> 31:57.615
We're off to do a crocodile safari
in the middle of nowhere.

31:57.682 --> 31:59.117
It's gonna be unreal.

32:00.551 --> 32:02.587
I actually quite like crocodiles.

32:02.654 --> 32:05.923
It's better than seeing something
like... birds.

32:07.358 --> 32:08.960
(all) Bye!

32:18.569 --> 32:21.706
Everyone's buzzing.
I have actually planned something

32:21.773 --> 32:25.410
that everyone enjoys and we're gonna
have a good time. Box ticked.

32:25.476 --> 32:28.746
There!
(both) Oh, my God!

32:28.813 --> 32:31.816
If I could be any animal,
I'd be a crocodile. Croc life!

32:31.883 --> 32:33.418
He's just chilling!

32:33.484 --> 32:35.920
Seeing crocodiles
in their natural habitat

32:35.987 --> 32:38.823
isn't exactly making me think
there's more to life

32:38.890 --> 32:40.525
than Jagerbombs and fake tan.

32:40.591 --> 32:43.227
But it is providing
a different perspective.

32:44.562 --> 32:47.932
That was worth seeing that one,
wasn't it? That was massive!

32:47.999 --> 32:49.934
The others will be well jealous.

32:50.001 --> 32:52.704
I bet they're sat at home
fingering the koi carp.

33:04.515 --> 33:07.652
I want to have a good time today,
so we're going to the beach.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.587
We are trying an Aussie tradition.

33:10.922 --> 33:12.957
Boomerang.
What the fuck?

33:13.024 --> 33:15.960
Stop it! Joel!

33:16.027 --> 33:17.061
What is that?

33:17.128 --> 33:20.298
Did you and Gary have a
bit of an argument last night?

33:20.365 --> 33:22.200
No, no, it wasn't an argument.

33:22.266 --> 33:26.003
I went up to see him cos
I kinda felt like he was on his own.

33:26.070 --> 33:29.707
Even though I was trying to prove
to everyone that I was over him,

33:29.774 --> 33:32.610
the only person I wanted
to prove to really was Gary.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.580
I would never want
to lose Mitch, ever. Never.

33:35.646 --> 33:37.215
Not even Gary is worth that.

33:37.281 --> 33:39.717
I feel as though
it's mission accomplished.

33:39.784 --> 33:42.520
Now I can think about
a friendship with Gary.

33:44.489 --> 33:46.924
I know. I know, exactly.

33:46.991 --> 33:49.527
I'm so proud of Charlotte
for coming this far

33:49.594 --> 33:52.063
and not being able
to go anywhere next to him.

33:52.130 --> 33:55.366
I'm starting to believe now
that they are totally over.

33:55.433 --> 33:56.601
Go on, Joel!

33:57.568 --> 33:58.603
(both) Nah.

34:03.808 --> 34:05.610
I'm off to see the boss, Steve,

34:05.676 --> 34:08.612
and I just hope he forgives us
and lets us back in.

34:15.085 --> 34:18.322
Hey, big fella.
How are you, mate?

34:18.389 --> 34:19.757
I deserve a bollocking,

34:19.824 --> 34:23.094
but I just hope that Steve
will let us back in that house.

34:23.161 --> 34:26.364
Been up to a bit of bloody mischief
again. Aye, little bit.

34:26.431 --> 34:30.268
Fucking violence doesn't solve
anything. It really doesn't.

34:30.333 --> 34:33.137
Use your fucking noggin.
I know.

34:33.204 --> 34:35.039
It's just total bullshit.

34:35.106 --> 34:38.643
I've learnt my lesson
and I really regret losing my cool.

34:38.708 --> 34:42.880
I'm not gonna let you back in
just yet. That's as simple as that.

34:42.947 --> 34:46.284
You want to pet my cocky?
(laughs)

34:48.052 --> 34:51.656
Gary and Scott are competing
for the same lass. Never goes well.

34:51.722 --> 34:54.725
This singles trip
was not meant to be like this.

34:56.159 --> 34:57.595
(screams)

35:00.731 --> 35:03.801
Do we give a fuck?
No, we fucking don't.

35:05.269 --> 35:08.172
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

35:10.041 --> 35:10.241
.

35:12.743 --> 35:12.944
.

35:22.119 --> 35:23.654
All about the love.

35:24.655 --> 35:26.657
So, tonight is hippy night.

35:26.724 --> 35:29.560
Me, Charlotte and Joel
are gonna bite the bullet,

35:29.627 --> 35:31.696
have a good time
and enjoy ourselves.

35:31.762 --> 35:34.499
This is the wig that's going on.
Is it Vicky's wig?

35:34.565 --> 35:35.733
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.069
Don't worry about it.
She'll never know.

35:38.135 --> 35:40.771
I hope that the other guys
are getting punished,

35:40.838 --> 35:42.907
because they are all troublemakers.

35:42.974 --> 35:46.077
Holly constantly kicks off,
Gaz kicks off all the time,

35:46.143 --> 35:49.280
Scott punches walls
and Vicky kisses everyone in sight.

35:49.347 --> 35:51.582
Oh, my God.
(laughs)

35:51.649 --> 35:53.284
Let's hit the club, man.

35:53.351 --> 35:56.754
Let's do it!
I wanna get so fucked up, man!

36:02.393 --> 36:04.295
Tonight, for the first time ever,

36:04.362 --> 36:07.365
it's just single people out
having fun, pulling.

36:07.431 --> 36:09.967
No hassle and no-one shouting.
I can't wait.

36:13.871 --> 36:15.740
We're going to a backpacker bar

36:15.806 --> 36:19.210
where I'm gonna give them
something to put in their backpack.

36:19.277 --> 36:21.879
We'll have a right laugh.
Yeah, a right laugh.

36:26.384 --> 36:28.719
Scott and Gaz
definitely are here to pull.

36:28.786 --> 36:30.187
It's their singles trip.

36:30.254 --> 36:33.157
A million and ten percent,
they are out to pull tonight.

36:33.224 --> 36:34.959
Singles night!
Oggy oggy!

36:35.026 --> 36:36.761
(all) Whoo!

36:46.771 --> 36:50.007
I'm not surprised at what people
are wearing at Mama Africa.

36:50.074 --> 36:52.376
There's not a fucking stiletto
in sight.

36:52.443 --> 36:54.679
But do I give a fuck? No.
Cos I'm a Geordie.

36:54.745 --> 36:57.882
That's not gonna change
just cos I'm in the Whitsundays.

37:00.885 --> 37:04.255
I do have a backpack. If somebody
told me, I could have wore it.

37:09.794 --> 37:12.029
The majority of the birds
in this bar

37:12.096 --> 37:13.998
look like squirrels on super nuts.

37:24.241 --> 37:26.410
This trip was an amazing idea.

37:26.477 --> 37:30.014
Hopefully when we get back, we can
just rebuild the family again.

37:39.991 --> 37:43.427
Hippies would not have alcohol
because they're high on peace

37:43.494 --> 37:46.964
and the euphoric feeling of
love and sex and orgasms.

37:47.031 --> 37:49.066
But we're gonna get fucked,

37:49.133 --> 37:53.237
cos we're meat-eating mortal
hippies who just love to shag.

38:13.424 --> 38:15.693
Hippies make the best of
a bad situation.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.663
They don't need material things
to have a good time.

38:18.729 --> 38:21.532
They don't need anything.
They just use love.

38:21.599 --> 38:24.802
All the angry people have gone
to be angry with each other.

38:24.869 --> 38:26.671
It's left with the peacemakers.

38:36.347 --> 38:37.782
I am so mortal.

38:37.848 --> 38:40.785
I'm the mortallest I've ever been
in Australia yet.

38:40.851 --> 38:42.853
And I'm dressed as a hippy.

38:55.766 --> 38:59.637
Me and Holly are about to reveal
the fact that we're massive bitches.

38:59.704 --> 39:03.441
We're having the best time, but we
have been slagging them off a bit.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.376
I'm shitting myself to tell them.

39:12.850 --> 39:15.853
So the lasses have been
slagging me off behind my back.

39:15.920 --> 39:18.456
Bothered?
Go and write in your fucking diary.

39:22.126 --> 39:24.562
Everyone in the house
slags me and Scott off.

39:24.628 --> 39:27.865
It's no skin off my nose,
and I'll still have a mint time.

39:36.574 --> 39:38.576
The lads totally take it
on the chin.

39:38.642 --> 39:40.478
All smiles, not even bothered.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.213
Might slag them off more then!

39:46.117 --> 39:47.852
Cheers!

39:49.720 --> 39:54.125
If me and Scott pull, one's
in the bedroom, one's on the sofa.

39:57.394 --> 40:01.165
Gary and Scott are competing for
the same lass. This never goes well.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.934
And the trip was going swimmingly
up until now.

40:08.272 --> 40:10.808
I'm not intentionally
trying to cock block,

40:10.875 --> 40:13.611
but for some reason
she's interested in my boobs.

40:13.677 --> 40:17.081
They are attention seekers.
They want to come out sometimes.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.719
Shnezzin' hell!
This girl knows what's up.

40:21.786 --> 40:23.587
So go on, Gaz, you can bang her.

40:32.229 --> 40:35.966
I need to get back to the apartment,
get in the double bed before Scott,

40:36.033 --> 40:37.535
cos fuck going on that sofa.

40:43.607 --> 40:45.643
Charlotte is fucked!

40:45.709 --> 40:49.914
How did Charlotte get in that state?
What's happened to her? She's gone!

40:52.082 --> 40:53.250
Come on.

40:53.317 --> 40:57.188
I feel like going out as hippies
doesn't make a bloody difference.

40:57.254 --> 41:00.357
You've got to get to bed,
then we're gonna put this on you,

41:00.424 --> 41:02.226
and then you'll be sick.

41:02.293 --> 41:05.496
Me, Sophie and Joel are making
the best of a bad situation.

41:05.563 --> 41:09.133
The others fucked off and left us
and James has been kicked out.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.603
But do we give a fuck?
No, we fucking don't.

41:23.147 --> 41:25.549
We had so much fun,
it was just such a laugh.

41:25.616 --> 41:28.319
It was good for once
not to watch boys pulling,

41:28.385 --> 41:30.120
not to watch people arguing,

41:30.187 --> 41:32.623
not watch people
get jealous over people.

41:32.690 --> 41:34.525
I don't want anyone to come back.

41:34.592 --> 41:36.894
I can't be arsed
for any more arguing.

41:36.961 --> 41:39.730
All I want is peace,
for fuck's sake.

41:47.771 --> 41:50.241
I don't even know
where the anger stems from.

41:50.307 --> 41:52.009
It just comes from nowhere.

41:52.076 --> 41:54.778
One minute I'm so happy
and the next I'm a psycho.

41:54.845 --> 41:57.181
(screams)

41:57.248 --> 41:59.383
Can I come in, please?
(indistinct)

41:59.450 --> 42:00.618
Ow!

42:00.684 --> 42:03.520
We've got to hang around
and wait for the lads

42:03.587 --> 42:04.989
and that irritates her.

42:05.055 --> 42:07.625
Why should they think
they're better than us?

42:07.691 --> 42:09.627
Why should we have to wait for them?

42:09.693 --> 42:12.162
That was horrible.
That was horrible.

42:12.229 --> 42:13.697
Fucking pathetic.
Gary!

42:13.764 --> 42:16.333
(indistinct)
We love you, too!

42:16.400 --> 42:19.136
All that graft Gaz put in
and his bird's ran away.

42:19.203 --> 42:20.704
I wonder what he said to her.

42:21.972 --> 42:23.073
Get Scott.

42:24.441 --> 42:27.645
The girls got off
cos the lads were acting like twats.

42:33.550 --> 42:36.987
(indistinct) I'm gonna pick you up
and we're going back home.

42:37.054 --> 42:41.625
No, we're not. Go and fucking jump
in that fence, you fucking idiot.

42:41.692 --> 42:44.361
I would love to tell you
what's wrong with Holly,

42:44.428 --> 42:48.465
to pinpoint exactly what it is
that makes her so irate at times.

42:48.532 --> 42:52.269
But I can't, because I'm not
a licensed medical professional.

42:52.336 --> 42:53.837
No! (screams)

42:53.904 --> 42:56.307
Let me go!
OK.

42:56.373 --> 43:00.210
I'm gonna be sick! I'm gonna be
sick! I'm gonna be sick! (screams)

43:00.277 --> 43:03.881
Now our whole night is dedicated
to getting Holly home and in bed.

43:03.948 --> 43:06.784
This singles trip
was not meant to be like this.

43:06.850 --> 43:11.722
I don't care. I honestly
couldn't give a fuck. Fine.

43:13.357 --> 43:15.893
If I can show Steve
that I can be good at one job.

43:15.960 --> 43:16.994
(screams)

43:17.895 --> 43:20.998
Scott's got four girls round him
like he's Hugh Hefner.

43:21.932 --> 43:23.867
Whoa, there's a shark! Oh my God!

43:23.934 --> 43:26.804
Steve's telling me
that I'm getting kicked out.

43:26.870 --> 43:28.806
Fuck off.
Fucking Gaz rocks up.

43:28.872 --> 43:31.508
I've been sent here as well.
Awkward.

43:32.376 --> 43:35.846
The closest I came to having sex
with him was fondling his ear.

43:35.913 --> 43:36.947
(snores)

43:37.014 --> 43:39.516
I'm making him put
all his thoughts on paper.

43:40.384 --> 43:43.087
Nothing Gary can say now
could change anything.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.757
It will still always be
Gary and Charlotte.

44:13.384 --> 44:13.584
.
