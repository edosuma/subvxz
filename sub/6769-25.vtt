{\an5}SCHIPPER:
<i>Do you feel faint</i>
<i>or lightheaded?</i>

00:05.797 --> 00:08.258
Are there any scrapes or
abrasions you haven't mentioned?

00:09.634 --> 00:10.093
Are you dizzy
or nauseous?

00:10.176 --> 00:12.429
(elevator bell dings)

00:12.512 --> 00:13.722
{\an3}Kelly?

00:13.805 --> 00:16.391
Um, he... hit me
in the ribs and stomach.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.560
{\an1}Are you sure there's
no one you want to call?

00:18.643 --> 00:20.228
{\an1}A family member
or a friend, anyone?

00:20.311 --> 00:21.229
No.

00:21.312 --> 00:22.313
Can you describe him at all?

00:22.397 --> 00:23.314
Scars, tattoo,

00:23.398 --> 00:24.774
jewelry, anything?

00:24.858 --> 00:25.775
I heard him coming.

00:25.859 --> 00:26.776
I should have run.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.486
Kelly, this is not your fault.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.071
We're going to get
you through this.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.072
Sgt. Cohen's handled

00:31.156 --> 00:32.323
hundreds of rape cases.

00:32.406 --> 00:33.450
One of them was mine.

00:33.533 --> 00:37.287
{\an1}But this next part-- the
rape kit-- it's not something

00:37.370 --> 00:38.496
any victim is ever prepared for.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.956
Victim?

00:40.039 --> 00:42.167
It involves your personal
history, physical exams,

00:42.250 --> 00:43.460
swabs, specimens.

00:43.543 --> 00:44.711
{\an1}What Nurse Schipper
is trying to

00:44.794 --> 00:46.296
say is, if you don't
want to continue...

00:46.379 --> 00:49.507
{\an3}It's your call.
You don't have to.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.508
Yeah.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.634
Okay.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.308

00:58.391 --> 00:59.309
Yes.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.019

Open up. It's me.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.229
(knocking)

01:06.524 --> 01:08.151
{\an1}Uh, hi.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.653
Um, I'm looking for Kelly.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.322
WhatGina...rise.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.823
It's 4:00 in the
morning, Dylan.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.492
{\an1}Look, I know
what time it is.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.160
{\an1}Here's the deal:
we were supposed to meet,

01:17.243 --> 01:18.536
and she did not show up
and she did not call me,

01:18.620 --> 01:20.079
so I am worried about her.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.998
WellNo, she's not with Matt.tt.

01:22.081 --> 01:23.833
I went by and her car
isn't there, okay?

01:23.917 --> 01:24.834
I'm worried, Gina.

01:24.918 --> 01:25.835
I don't care.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.670
{\an1}If she shows up here,
you tell her to call me.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.297
Yeah, I don't want you
to worry about Kelly.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.423
{\an1}Will you tell her
to call me?

01:30.507 --> 01:32.342
Is this some kind of nightmare,
you coming over here...

01:32.425 --> 01:34.511
No, I'm not gonna
Jutell her, all right?!e!

01:34.594 --> 01:35.845
{\an3}I'm not gonna tell
her anything for you.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.514
{\an3}Do you have any idea
how insensitive you are?

01:37.597 --> 01:38.515
{\an3}Just leave!

01:38.598 --> 01:40.642
JJust leave!r.

SCHIPPER:
<i>Your last menstrual period?</i>

01:51.569 --> 01:54.322
A week ago.

01:54.405 --> 01:57.534
Any recent surgeries,
diagnostic procedures,

01:57.617 --> 01:58.368
genital injuries?

01:58.451 --> 01:59.744
No.

01:59.828 --> 02:00.703
Last time you had intercourse?

02:00.787 --> 02:02.539
Did he burn you?

02:02.622 --> 02:04.207
No.

{\an1}No.e you?

02:06.626 --> 02:08.461
He said if I went to the police

02:08.544 --> 02:09.503
that he would kill me.

02:09.586 --> 02:12.215
Do you consent to
a physical exam,

02:12.298 --> 02:14.384
{\an3}including GC
and STD cultures?

02:14.467 --> 02:15.426
Yes.

hair or scalp?

02:22.433 --> 02:23.226
Yes.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.561
Do you consent
to being photographed?

02:24.644 --> 02:27.021
Did I say "pitch black?"

02:27.105 --> 02:28.523
Because I-I remember

02:28.606 --> 02:31.401
there was a light on.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.444
And this-- a streetlight.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.572
(sniffles)

02:35.655 --> 02:38.199
No, I-I don't, I don't want
to be photographed.

{\an1}Mmm.

Remember the house

Yeah.

Well, I couldn't figure out

And all of a sudden,
it hits me.

A test.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.178
{\an1}Yeah, to see how serious,
how committed I am.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.849
So I kind of took it upon
myself... and got us the house.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.643
{\an1}And I really negotiated
this thing.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.937
Noah, I don't want us
to move in together.

05:15.314 --> 05:17.233
Because I read this study
on couples that live together,

05:17.316 --> 05:18.651
and they were

05:18.735 --> 05:21.988
46% more likely to divorce
than couples

05:22.071 --> 05:23.698
who never lived together
before they got married.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.199
You're telling me you don't
want to move in right now,

05:25.283 --> 05:26.200
because you're afraid
we're gonna get divorced.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.368
Mm-hmm, exactly.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.870
Come on, what's the real reason?

05:31.456 --> 05:33.374
That I feel
we're moving too fast.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.375
(chuckles)

05:34.459 --> 05:35.418
After a year and a half?

05:35.501 --> 05:37.253
I'm sorry, that's how I feel.

05:37.336 --> 05:38.254
{\an1}Really?

05:38.337 --> 05:39.756
This is how I feel, okay?

05:39.839 --> 05:42.967

or we should call it quits.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.469

{\an1}Oh, hey.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.440
Do you want to hear this?

05:57.523 --> 05:58.608
It's so ridiculous.

05:58.691 --> 05:59.776
I mean, I started this whole

05:59.859 --> 06:00.985
{\an1}stupid flirtation thing
with Wayne.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.738
Then Noah asks me to move in
with him, and next thing I know,

06:03.821 --> 06:06.240
{\an1}I'm throwing my whole life
with Noah away.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.493
Oh, what happened to you?

06:08.576 --> 06:09.744
{\an3}Oh, this.

06:09.827 --> 06:13.331
{\an3}I, um, slipped on
one of Erin's toys.

06:13.414 --> 06:14.332
Oh.

06:14.415 --> 06:15.625
Anyway, I just feel like

06:15.708 --> 06:17.293
I can't really deal
with work right now.

06:17.376 --> 06:18.753
{\an1}Do you think you can
cover for me?

06:18.836 --> 06:21.589
I just need some time

10:18.951 --> 10:20.828
I was raped.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.548
{\an3}Did you go
to a doctor?

10:32.631 --> 10:35.384
Yeah.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.887
{\an3}Did-did you describe
him to the police?

10:37.970 --> 10:39.555
Mm-hmm.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.266
(sniffles)

10:42.350 --> 10:44.226
{\an3}We're gonna get
through this.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.395
{\an3}You're gonna
be fine.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.731
I don't know.

10:48.814 --> 10:53.444
{\an3}Whatever it takes, that's
what we're gonna do.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.363
{\an3}I promise, you're
gonna be fine.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.872
{\an5}MATT:
<i>It's just a breaking</i>
<i>and entering this time.</i>

11:04.955 --> 11:05.706
They trailed him three blocks

11:05.790 --> 11:07.249
{\an1}from broken store
window to crash pad.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.210
{\an3}And I take it you had
a search warrant.

11:09.293 --> 11:11.003
Exigent circumstances, pal.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.130
{\an1}They saw the suspect
carrying said stolen item

11:13.214 --> 11:15.091
{\an1}into his apartment.
Case closed.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.717
{\an1}Me, I'd keep
my fingers away

11:16.801 --> 11:17.968
{\an1}from the judge's gavel
on this one.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.387
Oh, there's our
slime bag now.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.596
{\an3}Hey, Joe,

11:20.679 --> 11:22.348
{\an3}I'll be getting
you out soon.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.076
{\an1}You didn't see
anything there, okay?

11:42.159 --> 11:44.412
Of course not.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.497
(teakettle whistling)

11:51.752 --> 11:53.254
I wanted to talk to you
about me and Gina.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.798
You and Gina.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.591
I just want to make sure
you're cool with it?

11:57.675 --> 11:59.760
With it?

11:59.844 --> 12:01.011
Yeah, it.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.932
Apparently,
you've moved on, so...

12:05.015 --> 12:06.934
Not that you saw

12:07.017 --> 12:08.936
anything, right?

12:13.065 --> 12:16.694
{\an3}I would, uh, suggest
that you wait--

12:16.777 --> 12:17.987
{\an3}on Gina.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.032
You're suggesting
that as a friend?

12:22.116 --> 12:24.493
Yeah.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.663
It's for Gina's sake.

12:27.746 --> 12:30.875
Are you cool with it or not?

12:30.958 --> 12:36.505
David, you do whatever
you want to do, okay?

12:51.103 --> 12:52.730
Thank you.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.528
{\an1}You know, I keep
thinking that if I--

12:59.612 --> 13:02.364
I never asked you
to come meet me

13:02.448 --> 13:03.741
that this wouldn't
have happened.

13:03.824 --> 13:06.660
It's no one's fault.

13:06.744 --> 13:07.745
That's what
they keep telling me.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.958
You're so sweet.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.751
{\an3}You're a little blind,
but you're definitely sweet.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.044
Get out of here.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.712
Go on, that was a
beautiful salchow

13:58.796 --> 14:01.674
and I-- you know, I've seen
a lot of salchows in my day.

14:01.757 --> 14:02.716
That one was nice.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.136
{\an3}That was actually
a double sal.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.846
{\an4}You see I
shortchanged
you then.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.390
I should go for a six.

14:09.473 --> 14:10.724
{\an1}You looked really
good out there.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.226
Yeah?

14:12.309 --> 14:14.353
I don't think you'll have
any problem making the cut

14:14.436 --> 14:16.730
on this whole
ice-skating tour.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.482
Thanks.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.109
(chuckles)

14:20.192 --> 14:21.944
What?

14:22.027 --> 14:24.321
{\an1}I just-- I feel like
such an idiot you know,

14:24.405 --> 14:26.448
{\an1}'cause I know absolutely
nothing about ice-skating.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.617
{\an1}Zero.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.452
I don't know, you know,
maybe, maybe we should,

14:30.536 --> 14:32.329
{\an1}like, go have dinner so
you can explain it all to me

14:32.413 --> 14:36.292
{\an1}so I'm not such a...
ice-skating idiot.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.169
Are you asking me out?

14:39.253 --> 14:41.088
What do you mean,
like, on a date?

14:42.548 --> 14:43.841
No, no.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.635
Come on, get out of here.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.637
{\an1}We don't have
time for a date.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.514
{\an1}We got, we got
Soul Coughing tonight,

14:50.598 --> 14:52.099
you know, front row, center.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.475
Yes, I can't wait
for Soul Coughing.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.811
Neither can I.

14:55.894 --> 15:00.482
Um, I'd love to have dinner.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.318
It's just that...

15:02.401 --> 15:05.446
I don't really know if I'm
ready for that, you know?

15:05.529 --> 15:06.989
If this has anything
to do with Dylan,

15:07.072 --> 15:11.493
I had a conversation with
him about this whole thing

15:11.577 --> 15:13.537
and uh, he said
he was fine with it.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.830
You had a conversation
with Dylan

15:14.913 --> 15:16.332
about going to dinner with me?

15:16.415 --> 15:18.167
No, not about specifically
taking you out to dinner,

15:18.250 --> 15:19.501
just, you know, the whole thing

15:19.585 --> 15:22.504
{\an1}in general, and I mean
He said it was cool?

15:22.588 --> 15:23.631
That's what he said.

15:25.424 --> 15:29.595
You know what, David, I'd love
to have dinner with you.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.474
{\an1}For you.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.142
Thank you.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.858
Kel.

15:42.941 --> 15:44.360
Hey.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.320
Is everything okay with us?

15:46.403 --> 15:48.697
Oh, about the mix-up
at the store yesterday?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.240
Yeah, it's fine.
Forget about it.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.241
Good. Just checking.

15:51.325 --> 15:55.537
Um, I kind of need your advice
about something.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.374
Okay.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.542
Exactly how many guys
have you slept with?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.753
Donna.

16:02.836 --> 16:05.422
{\an3}Well, what--
Dylan, Brandon,

16:05.506 --> 16:06.674
Colin, Matt.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.258
Is there a point to this?

16:08.342 --> 16:11.553
Wayne-- I think I want
to have sex with him.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.514
So have it.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.057
Yeah, but every guy
you've been with,

16:15.140 --> 16:17.267
it's been something serious,
and same with me.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.852
And what, you don't
take Wayne seriously?

16:18.936 --> 16:20.020
I don't know.

16:20.104 --> 16:21.522
He's a beach volleyball player.

16:21.605 --> 16:24.858
He's fly-by-night,
but he's so cute.

16:24.942 --> 16:28.862
I'm, uh, I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.864
I'm asking about casual sex.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.032
Is it wrong?

16:32.116 --> 16:35.452
There is no such thing
as casual sex.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.871
{\an1}DYLAN:
We're late.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.545
Listen, I'm having
the locks changed.

16:44.628 --> 16:45.546
Why?

16:45.629 --> 16:47.548
My purse was stolen.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.967
We have to meet that guy.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.093
What guy?

16:51.176 --> 16:52.803
The lock guy.

16:53.887 --> 16:55.305
Bye.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.433
You know, Kel, at some point

16:57.516 --> 17:00.602
{\an1}you're gonna have to tell
your friends what happened.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.020
I'm just not ready.

17:02.104 --> 17:05.523
The police, yes, but
everybody else, no.

17:11.029 --> 17:12.823
So run the details by me again.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.657
Okay. I buy 15 rocks a day,

17:14.742 --> 17:17.618
but I only sell ten in order
to keep up my own habit.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.829
You with me so far?

17:18.912 --> 17:20.622
Your crack habit,Right.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.500
So around 2:00 a.m.,
I'm about to sell out my quota.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.335
This one guy,
he's all strung out.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.962
Plus, you know,
he's shy the cash.

17:27.045 --> 17:29.214
So he shows you his boom box.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.507
I mean, CD, tape deck,

17:30.591 --> 17:31.592
equalizer, subwoofer.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.343
Tells me it's his brother's.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.679
Look, I know you got
me down for low-rent.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.806
But I am telling you,
this guy was sick.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.683
{\an1}So you trade the crack
for the stereo.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.311
That's real humanitarian.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.980
Look, I never said
I was an angel.

17:45.063 --> 17:46.690
But on this deal, I am innocent.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.485
Where did the police
make the bust?

17:49.568 --> 17:51.028
In my apartment. Why?

17:55.240 --> 17:56.658
So I can use a pseudonym?

17:56.742 --> 17:58.327
{\an3}We'll protect you
as much as possible.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.661
Yeah, and when
he's caught?

17:59.745 --> 18:02.331
{\an3}At the trial, you
will have to see him.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.457
Why?

18:03.540 --> 18:05.667
{\an3}He has the right
to face his accuser.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.294
I can't believe
he has any rights

18:07.377 --> 18:08.796
after what he did.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.673
{\an3}Look, this is a book
of sex offenders.

18:11.757 --> 18:15.677
{\an3}Take it in the back room,
have a seat, take your time.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.971
I'll get you some coffee.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.349
You don't have any
leads yet, do you?

18:20.432 --> 18:22.142
Not yet, no.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.650
Steve, it's filthy down there.

18:29.733 --> 18:32.528
Well, I'm capturing
the dirty underbelly of L.A.

18:32.611 --> 18:33.862
And your metaphor's the sewer?

18:33.946 --> 18:35.322
(chuckles)

18:35.405 --> 18:37.699
Caufield said he wanted
to see more of my work.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.660
This is where I create it.

18:39.743 --> 18:43.205
Um, you said you did this
all the way through college?

18:43.288 --> 18:45.541
{\an3}I remember reading an article
about Jackson Pollack.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.835
{\an1}Oh, uh, from the '50s?
Action painting.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.753
{\an3}He said his style was
influences by road trips

18:49.837 --> 18:51.755
{\an3}his family would take
when he was a kid.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.215
His father would stop

18:53.298 --> 18:54.758
along the roadside
to relieve himself

18:54.842 --> 18:57.386
and spatter rocks.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.012
And that's how modern art
was changed forever.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.056
Well, you gotta have
a muse right?

19:01.139 --> 19:02.516
I got mine.

19:02.599 --> 19:03.851
(chuckles)

19:03.934 --> 19:07.062
Check that out.

19:07.145 --> 19:09.439
Steve, if your eye's focused

19:09.523 --> 19:11.024
through the lens, won't you...?

19:11.108 --> 19:13.610
Fall? A photographer's
got to make sacrifices.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.409
Oh!

19:25.247 --> 19:26.915
(laughing)

19:28.542 --> 19:30.127
DAVID:
Gina, just wait out here, okay.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.588
{\an1}I'm gonna run in and get
the tickets and we'll be gone.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.132
No. You said that Soul Coughing
doesn't start for another hour.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.925
{\an1}I know, but I like
getting there early,

19:37.009 --> 19:38.927
and warming up my seat

19:39.011 --> 19:41.471
and, you know, preparing
mWhat're you doing?.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.224
{\an1}Did we not have a
good time at dinner tonight?

19:44.308 --> 19:48.604
I actually had a great
time at dinner tonight.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.480
Ha, there you go.

19:50.564 --> 19:51.648
Wait here.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.864
{\an3}Well, um, ten seconds--
don't go anywhere.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.115
Hurry.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.494
Now's not really a good time.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.330
Not a good time for what?

20:06.413 --> 20:07.664
{\an3}What'd you bring home
another one-night wonder?

20:07.748 --> 20:08.790
{\an3}Got 'em.

20:08.874 --> 20:09.833
{\an3}Dylan, always
a pleasure.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.126
Let's go.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.171
Oh, what a surprise.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.672
{\an3}DYLAN:
I think you guys

20:15.756 --> 20:16.798
should just go now.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.508
Yeah, we should
definitely go.

20:18.592 --> 20:19.927
You two deserve each other.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.141
I'm sorry about that.
You didn't need that.

20:26.224 --> 20:29.478
Um, I think I'm gonna go home.

20:29.561 --> 20:30.479
Kelly...

20:30.562 --> 20:32.314
Dylan, just take me home, okay?

20:32.397 --> 20:34.650
Okay.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.485
DONNA:
<i>I went on a trip</i>

20:36.568 --> 20:38.487
and on this trip in my suitcase

20:38.570 --> 20:41.490
I packed a hairbrush,
a pogo stick,

20:41.573 --> 20:43.158
sunblock,

20:43.241 --> 20:44.660
an elephant...

20:44.743 --> 20:45.953
An Indian elephant.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.037
Are you writing this down?

20:47.120 --> 20:48.830
Not a word.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.499
'Cause this is a memory game,
so if you're cheating.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.167
A butterfly necklace.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.003
Was that on the list?

20:55.087 --> 20:56.672
No, but you were wearing it
the day we met.

20:56.755 --> 20:57.673
(beep)

20:57.756 --> 21:00.300
Is thIt's me.r me?

21:00.384 --> 21:01.677
You want to get it?

21:01.760 --> 21:04.513
No. So tell me what else
do you remember?

21:04.596 --> 21:09.851
(phone ringing)

21:09.935 --> 21:12.604
(sighs)

21:20.612 --> 21:22.864
(doorknob rattling)

21:22.948 --> 21:24.449
Donna.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.412
{\an3}DONNA:
What?

21:28.495 --> 21:29.913
Never mind.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.210
(clearing throat)

21:35.293 --> 21:38.797
{\an1}Hey.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.215
My, uh, my key.

21:40.298 --> 21:41.842
{\an1}Oh, yeah.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.051
We had the locks changed.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.845
I'll get you a new one.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.388
{\an3}You lost your
keys, too?

21:46.471 --> 21:48.432
I thought you said you
only lost your wallet.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.350
Um, no, my purse.

21:50.434 --> 21:51.852
{\an1}I said they
took my purse.

21:51.935 --> 21:54.730
My keys, everything.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.064
Which you left at the Peach Pit.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.191
Yeah I left it
under the table,

21:58.275 --> 22:00.527
and they just took it.
I didn't even know.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.571
{\an3}I'm sorry
that happened.

22:02.654 --> 22:03.864
(sighs):
Yeah.

22:03.947 --> 22:06.033
{\an3}So... hey,

22:06.116 --> 22:08.577
{\an3}what happened to
your lip? Hmm?

22:08.660 --> 22:11.038
Uh... mm, I-I just cut it.

22:11.121 --> 22:13.415
Uh, Erin hit me.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.792
{\an3}SheYeah.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.419
{\an3}What's wrong, baby?
You're shaking.

22:17.502 --> 22:18.545
Mm.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.922
I'm just Yeah?

22:21.006 --> 22:22.883
Well, I could take care of that.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.096
Matt?

22:28.180 --> 22:29.306
{\an3}Yeah?

22:29.389 --> 22:31.475
I'm-I'm just not
in a very good mood.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.810
What's going on, Kelly?

22:35.687 --> 22:37.355
It's not... it's not us.

22:37.439 --> 22:40.317
It's, uh, it's not you.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.860
{\an3}(laughs)

22:41.943 --> 22:43.320
It's... oh, it's...

22:43.403 --> 22:44.488
That's... that's comforting.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.156
That's-that's great.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.327
Don't do this, okay?

22:50.410 --> 22:52.329
Do what? Ask where
you were last night

22:52.412 --> 22:53.663
{\an3}when your wallet--
no, wait--

22:53.747 --> 22:55.457
your purse was left--
I'm sorry-- stolen

22:55.540 --> 22:57.626
at the Peach Pit before you
baby-sat for Erin

22:57.709 --> 22:58.627
at yourMatt...

22:58.710 --> 22:59.961
No, l-look,
I don't want

23:00.045 --> 23:02.631
to ask this--
you are making me ask you this.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.800
Were you with Dylan last night?
Yes or no?

23:07.427 --> 23:09.596
I think that you should go.

23:09.679 --> 23:12.682
Happy to.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.062
(door opens)

23:17.145 --> 23:19.147
(door slams)

23:35.372 --> 23:37.290
Door was unlocked.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.626
{\an3}So, you got a Southern
Cal Electric bill,

23:39.709 --> 23:42.838
{\an3}a gas bill and a low, low,
low offer for a platinum card.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.548
Confidentiality.

23:44.631 --> 23:46.007
I thought you lawyers

23:46.091 --> 23:47.634
were into that
sort of thing.

23:47.717 --> 23:48.510
I want to know

23:48.593 --> 23:50.053
what's going on
between you and Kelly.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.264
Nothing.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.474
I asked her if you two

23:54.558 --> 23:56.143
were togeth(sighs)other night.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.644
We weren't.

23:57.727 --> 24:00.147
Not in the way
that you think, anyway.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.314
But you were together.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.483
I'm telling you, don't go there.

24:03.567 --> 24:04.693
Don't go there?
Where, Mexico?

24:04.776 --> 24:06.027
{\an1}Huh? What's
my alternative, Dylan?

24:06.111 --> 24:07.737
To give you
the benefit of the doubt?

24:07.821 --> 24:08.572
I don't think so.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.366
You remember
my little snort fetish?

24:11.449 --> 24:14.327
I was getting ready
to do heroin again.

24:14.411 --> 24:15.495
And Kelly talked you out of it.

24:15.579 --> 24:16.872
She's a good friend.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.915
She's a good person.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.751
Don't take advantage of that.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.837
I'll try to remember that.

24:31.136 --> 24:34.723
{\an5}(sighs):
I'm not gonna
make the cut.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.224
Stop. You're
doing great.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.726
No. I feel like
a zombie today.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.394
{\an3}That's only 'cause Soul
Coughing went on so late.

24:39.477 --> 24:43.356
{\an5}Yeah, I shouldn't have stayed
out till 2:00 in the morning
the night before an audition.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.192
{\an1}I just,
I just, uh...

24:45.275 --> 24:47.360
I need a little sugar rush.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.904
You know what?
It's my fault.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.739
{\an3}I mean, if
I hadn't've

24:50.822 --> 24:51.740
left the tickets at home,

24:51.823 --> 24:52.908
you wouldn't have run
into Dylan and Kelly.

24:52.991 --> 24:55.869
You know, that's what this
whole thing's about, right?

24:55.952 --> 24:57.245
DI hate to lose.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.371
What?

24:59.998 --> 25:01.750
I-I hate to lose.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.376
What do you mean,
you hate to lose?

25:03.460 --> 25:05.212
What does that...
what does that mean?

25:05.295 --> 25:06.421
David, what part
don't you understand?

25:06.504 --> 25:07.380
I'm saying I hate to lose.

25:07.464 --> 25:08.924
Is this something like about me?

25:09.007 --> 25:10.592
{\an3}A little guidance
here would be nice.

25:10.675 --> 25:13.428
I was trying to give you
some guidance and...

25:13.511 --> 25:16.097
You know what,
I-I can't have this conversation

25:16.181 --> 25:18.308
with you right now, okay?

25:22.354 --> 25:24.147
(sighs)

25:42.749 --> 25:44.626
You know what, um...

25:44.709 --> 25:47.462
{\an1}we are actually
closing right now.

25:47.545 --> 25:48.672
What?

25:48.755 --> 25:50.590
It's barely 1Yeah.

25:50.674 --> 25:53.510
We're about to start
our annual inventory.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.670
(line rings)

26:28.753 --> 26:30.672
WOMAN:
RAINN Rape Crisis Center.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.966
Hi. Um, I was given your name

26:33.049 --> 26:36.011
by one of the nurses
at L.A. Memorial.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.388
Are you somewhere you feel safe?

26:38.471 --> 26:41.016
(laughs)
Safe.

26:41.099 --> 26:44.019
Uh, I... yeah, I think so.

26:44.102 --> 26:47.022
Okay, look,
you're not alone now.

26:47.105 --> 26:48.148
I'm with you.

26:48.231 --> 26:50.317
Can you tell me what happened?

26:50.400 --> 26:52.193
(sighs)

26:52.277 --> 26:54.988
MATT:
<i>My client Joe Patch lives here.</i>

26:55.071 --> 26:57.407
{\an6}The cops chase him
three blocks, and
they enter here.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.826
He's carrying
a boom box, then...

26:59.909 --> 27:01.828
Steve, what are you doing?

27:01.911 --> 27:03.455
This lobby's pure
Raymond Chandler.

27:03.538 --> 27:06.166
I figured I'd tag
tThat's great,g.

27:06.249 --> 27:09.169
{\an3}but it helps if you
take off the lens cap.

27:09.252 --> 27:10.086
Right. I know.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.756
{\an3}Janet told me you knew
what you were doing.

27:12.839 --> 27:15.175
{\an1}Well, I maybe misled
her a little bit.

27:15.258 --> 27:16.926
{\an3}She said you
were an artist.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.845
{\an1}Okay, so I flat-out
lied to her.

27:18.928 --> 27:21.473
{\an4}Give me a break--
she's so highbrow,
it's tough keeping up.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.141
{\an3}Steve, I asked you
to come along

27:23.224 --> 27:24.851
{\an3}because I need pictures
of the crime scene.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.728
{\an1}Well, how hard
can that be?

27:26.811 --> 27:30.607
{\an6}Well, if you don't
know your f-stop from
your shutter speed, very.

27:30.690 --> 27:34.652
{\an5}Here, just keep it on
auto focus and shoot
where I point, okay?

27:34.736 --> 27:36.279
Right there.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.114
Matt Durning, private eye.

27:38.198 --> 27:39.574
{\an3}Be serious
for a minute.

27:39.657 --> 27:41.451
{\an3}I just need proof
that the police

27:41.534 --> 27:42.577
{\an3}didn't have exigent
circumstances.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.579
{\an1}And exigent circumstances
means what?

27:44.662 --> 27:46.331
Well, that the police

27:46.414 --> 27:48.083
{\an3}had cause to
follow my client,

27:48.166 --> 27:49.626
and then, spotting
the stolen goods,

27:49.709 --> 27:52.796
search his apartment
without a court order.

27:52.879 --> 27:55.090
All right. Good.
Take one right here.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.136
Okay, good. Now, I just
want a reenactment shot.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.930
{\an3}One of me, like,
entering the lobby.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.264
Why don't you just
use the video camera?

28:03.348 --> 28:03.973
Video camera?

28:04.057 --> 28:06.393
That video camera.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.104
That video camera.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.939
Steve, you are a true genius.

28:11.022 --> 28:13.066
If you say so.
(chuckles)

28:14.025 --> 28:16.945
WAYNE:
<i>She comes over to my place...</i>

28:17.028 --> 28:18.780
stays for dinner.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.490
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:20.573 --> 28:22.951
I give you
the new Donna Martin.

28:23.034 --> 28:26.287
{\an3}Well, not entirely
new or improved.

28:26.371 --> 28:29.499
Well, no improvement necessary.

28:38.550 --> 28:40.635
People do this, right?

28:40.718 --> 28:43.430
They, um...

28:43.513 --> 28:45.807
hook up, no promises, no ties?

28:45.890 --> 28:47.809
Some do.
But if you don't want to...

28:47.892 --> 28:49.269
No, I...

28:49.352 --> 28:50.478
I do.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.480
It's just kind of new to me.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.357
New's good.

29:06.828 --> 29:07.829
(exhales)

29:07.912 --> 29:08.913
{\an3}Sorry.

29:08.997 --> 29:11.833
Maybe I just...

29:11.916 --> 29:14.127
{\an3}I just I need a
little more time.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.171
I'm leaving
for Acapulco next week.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.131
What? Um, for how long?

29:18.214 --> 29:19.883
{\an1}Well, it's just
a tournament.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.217
First in a series.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.887
How long is the series?

29:23.970 --> 29:24.762
No, Donna, Donna,

29:24.846 --> 29:26.890
I'm asking you
to come along with me.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.017
Acapulco is amazing.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.769
I don't think I can get away.

29:31.853 --> 29:32.729
It'd mean a lot to me.

29:32.812 --> 29:36.900
{\an1}I know this beautiful place,
built for privacy.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.818
{\an1}It's cut into this
hillside, right?

29:38.902 --> 29:42.071
And every room in it
has a balcony and a pool.

29:42.155 --> 29:44.449
(laughs softly)

29:44.532 --> 29:47.494
How many girls
have you taken there?

29:47.577 --> 29:49.871
Look, if you don't want to do
this, I understand completely.

29:49.954 --> 29:52.916
No, I'd...
I'd like to go-- it's...

29:52.999 --> 29:54.250
(sighs)

29:54.334 --> 29:56.169
You are not one

29:56.252 --> 29:57.378
in a line of women.

29:59.506 --> 30:01.257
I don't know.

30:01.341 --> 30:02.884
(sighs)
I'm sorry,

30:02.967 --> 30:05.011
{\an3}I just...

30:05.094 --> 30:06.888
I think I should go home.

30:06.971 --> 30:09.015
{\an1}It's okay.

30:09.098 --> 30:10.642
I'll take you home.

30:10.725 --> 30:12.227
Thanks.

30:14.854 --> 30:17.690
(sighs)

30:20.693 --> 30:22.946
{\an3}Hey, oh, I'm not done
with that yet.

30:23.029 --> 30:24.948
{\an1}(laughs): A little
girl like you.

30:25.031 --> 30:27.242
WhereI don't know.t all?

30:27.325 --> 30:28.743
Oh...

30:29.702 --> 30:31.329
Hey, Nat.

30:32.497 --> 30:35.083
{\an1}I saw your car
in the parking lot.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.919
{\an3}Nat, could I get my check
right away, please?

30:38.002 --> 30:39.712
{\an1}Sure, hon.

30:41.881 --> 30:44.133
So, how's the competition?

30:45.343 --> 30:46.970
I don't know.

30:47.053 --> 30:49.806
I've been skating.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.599
Why don't you ask Kelly?

30:51.683 --> 30:53.935
We've beenShe hasn'that, Gina.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.228
been home for
the last three nights,

30:55.311 --> 30:59.232
so I just figured that you two
were, you know, hanging out...

31:00.692 --> 31:02.443
No, actually, kids.

31:02.527 --> 31:05.613
I was... I've been
doing you a favor.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.115
Thanks.

31:07.198 --> 31:08.908
You don't want to be with me.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.285
(chuckles)

31:10.368 --> 31:12.287
I'm poison.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.289
People around me die.

31:14.372 --> 31:15.957
That's such an old story, Dylan.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.042
There's always a new twist.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.419
Will you do me a favor?

31:20.712 --> 31:23.923
Will you stop breaking up
with me?

31:24.007 --> 31:26.009
It just makes me feel worse.

31:55.913 --> 31:58.916
(gagging, vomiting)

32:06.924 --> 32:08.676
Kel?

32:08.760 --> 32:10.678
Gina?

32:10.762 --> 32:12.764
Anybody?

32:17.602 --> 32:20.021
Oh, good you're home.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.398
{\an1}What's up?

32:24.400 --> 32:26.569
Kel, what's wrong?

32:30.448 --> 32:33.201
Give me a reason to kill you
and I will.

32:33.284 --> 32:34.827
(echoing): <i> I will.</i>

32:34.911 --> 32:37.830
I was meeting Dylan for coffee.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.917
He wanted to talk.

32:42.085 --> 32:44.003
And this guy...

32:44.087 --> 32:45.838
(Kelly screaming)

32:45.922 --> 32:48.007
...he pushed me.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.384
What do you mean he pushed you?

32:49.467 --> 32:52.011
From behind.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.931
He had a knife.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.685
Someone attacked you?

33:02.146 --> 33:03.606
(shirt rips)

33:04.857 --> 33:06.818
My God.

33:06.901 --> 33:08.611
(sobbing continues)

33:12.156 --> 33:14.617
He said
that he would kill me...

33:14.701 --> 33:15.827
...and I will.

33:15.910 --> 33:16.911
and I guess, in a way, he did.

33:31.342 --> 33:35.221
{\an1}Donna!
Oh, wow. Look,

33:35.304 --> 33:36.139
{\an1}I was hoping
to run into you.

33:36.222 --> 33:39.767
{\an3}Uh, I want to apologize
for last night.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.228
No, you don't,
you don't have to.

33:42.311 --> 33:44.439
I mean, I'm the one
who's sending mixed signals.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.607
No, no, I think,
I think maybe I pushed it

33:46.691 --> 33:48.025
just a little too far,

33:48.109 --> 33:49.277
and I'm sorry.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.947
I'm just in a really weird place
right now.

33:53.030 --> 33:54.282
Which is why I'm here.

33:54.365 --> 33:57.910
If there's anything
I can do to help.

33:57.994 --> 33:59.954
Yeah, there is.

34:00.037 --> 34:02.206
You can give me
a little more time.

34:14.385 --> 34:16.094
MATT:
<i>Derek, I have proof</i>

34:16.179 --> 34:17.429
the police didn't have
exigent circumstances

34:17.513 --> 34:18.848
{\an1}when they arrested
Joe Patch.

34:18.931 --> 34:22.310
{\an6}Look, I'm up to my ass
in some call-girl ring.
Another time, okay?

34:22.393 --> 34:24.020
{\an1}Don't believe me?
Come here.

34:25.855 --> 34:28.274
{\an1}Come on, Durning,
grow up.

34:28.357 --> 34:30.525
I want you to release
my client or face me

34:30.610 --> 34:31.860
{\an3}in court on obstruction
of justice.

34:31.944 --> 34:33.780
{\an3}Fine.

34:33.862 --> 34:35.782
See it and weep.

34:44.331 --> 34:45.666
{\an3}Yeah? So?

34:45.750 --> 34:47.043
Blow me away.

34:48.418 --> 34:49.879
Okay.

34:51.547 --> 34:54.967
What's Joe carrying?
It's a plastic bag.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.803
It's not a stolen stereo.
It's a plastic bag.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.638
The police filed
a false report.

34:58.721 --> 35:00.640
They never saw the stereo.
It was covered.

35:00.723 --> 35:02.975
Therefore, they had no legal
right to enter Joe's apartment.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.561
{\an3}They just wanted
to lock him away, Derek.

35:05.645 --> 35:07.980
They probably could have, too,
if they only followed the law.

35:08.064 --> 35:10.817
{\an3}I have something
for you.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.820
I have a bill of release.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.613
{\an3}You'll get me
next time, counselor.

35:17.406 --> 35:19.367
(frustrated grunt)

35:21.327 --> 35:23.412
(upbeat '50s rock playing)

35:23.496 --> 35:26.582
{\an1}Remember the glasses
you wanted?

35:26.666 --> 35:27.625
From the store on Melrose?

35:27.708 --> 35:28.960
Yep, here they are.

35:29.043 --> 35:30.753
I got 'em for you.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.922
You know how much I hate
shopping.

35:33.005 --> 35:36.926
Yeah, I know.

35:37.009 --> 35:40.555
Here we go, two quarts of
chicken soup. Somebody sick?

35:40.638 --> 35:44.225
{\an3}Yeah, Kelly has the flu.
Thank you so much.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.435
Okay, honey.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.230
Change your mind
about the house?

35:49.313 --> 35:51.732
I can't talk now.

35:51.816 --> 35:52.650
'Cause Kelly has the flu?

35:52.733 --> 35:56.070
Is it okay if I pick up
the glasses later?

35:56.153 --> 35:57.738
(scoffs)
It's a yes-or-no question.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.740
But you know that it's not.

35:59.824 --> 36:00.700
No, I don't.

36:00.783 --> 36:04.745
Can you please just call me
at home later

36:04.829 --> 36:05.913
and we'll talk, okay?

36:05.997 --> 36:08.791
Just trust me.
Call me at home.

36:08.875 --> 36:09.876
Okay.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.800
I was innocent.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.594
Drop it, okay?

36:19.677 --> 36:20.636
You swiped the stereo.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.598
Just like you swiped
the silver pen off my desk

36:23.681 --> 36:25.433
not three minutes ago.

36:27.184 --> 36:28.769
You think stealing's amusing?

36:28.853 --> 36:30.771
It's a living.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.231
{\an1}Well, there's
some extra hours

36:32.315 --> 36:33.274
the court
won't reimburse me for,

36:33.357 --> 36:34.942
so I expect you
to pay me in full.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.152
And get your feet off my desk.

36:36.235 --> 36:40.239
How about an in-kind payment?
I got this gorgeous stereo.

36:40.323 --> 36:41.949
How about getting out of here,
okay?

36:42.033 --> 36:44.368
{\an1}I got a lot
of work to do.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.999
Oh, uh, counselor, hmm?

36:51.042 --> 36:51.959
It was on your desk.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.921
Was hoping for a Rolex.
Think about the stereo.

36:55.004 --> 36:57.131
It'll definitely cover
your costs.

37:01.260 --> 37:03.179
KELLY:
They haven't found him?

37:03.262 --> 37:09.185
No. The sergeant says your
description keeps changing.

37:09.268 --> 37:10.811
So he's still out there.

37:10.895 --> 37:13.606
But maybe in a few days,
his face will come back to you.

37:13.689 --> 37:14.565
That's just it, Dylan.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.109
I don't want his face
to come back to me.

37:19.612 --> 37:20.905
Kelly?

37:23.866 --> 37:24.784
{\an3}I, uh,

37:24.867 --> 37:26.118
I just want to say I'm sorry

37:26.202 --> 37:28.371
for doubting you guys.

37:28.454 --> 37:31.374
The secrets and stuff-- I know
we're, we're past all that.

37:31.457 --> 37:32.959
Forget about it.

37:33.042 --> 37:36.420
And, Dylan, if you need any
help, just let me know.

37:36.504 --> 37:39.423
Okay. I'll see ya.

37:42.885 --> 37:44.136
{\an3}(sighs)

37:44.220 --> 37:45.179
So then, we're okay,

37:45.262 --> 37:47.181
{\an3}right?

37:53.354 --> 37:54.897
{\an3}And this?

37:54.981 --> 37:57.650
{\an3}This is a comment
on LA's underbelly.

38:01.654 --> 38:02.905
{\an1}And this?

38:02.989 --> 38:03.906
{\an3}This I call

38:03.990 --> 38:06.200
"Overexposed."

38:09.662 --> 38:10.746
What about this?

38:10.830 --> 38:12.206
Oh, this, this,

38:12.289 --> 38:14.583
{\an3}I, uh, I framed
the wall.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.752
I ran out of pictures.

38:16.836 --> 38:17.920
{\an3}(laughs)

38:18.004 --> 38:19.839
FrameYeah. wall?

38:19.922 --> 38:24.760
Okay. My opinion?

38:24.844 --> 38:27.722
Keep the day job.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.473
Hey, hey, what about the picture
you liked?

38:29.557 --> 38:30.850
You're still gonna publish
that, aren't ya?

38:30.933 --> 38:31.851
(door shuts)

38:31.934 --> 38:35.229
{\an3}You know, a lot
of people

38:35.312 --> 38:37.898
didn't understand
Pollack at first.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.233
{\an1}That's because
he was a genius.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.903
{\an3}I think that your
pictures are, are very...

38:42.987 --> 38:43.904
Bad?

38:43.988 --> 38:45.239
No, they're rudimentary.

38:45.322 --> 38:48.075
{\an6}I mean, people say
that Picasso spent
his entire life trying

38:48.159 --> 38:50.244
{\an3}to see through
the eyes of a child.

38:50.327 --> 38:53.247
{\an3}And, Steve, you
already have that.

38:53.330 --> 38:57.251
It was a compliment.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.795
{\an1}You know that picture
of the porn star?

38:59.879 --> 39:01.922
I tripped over a bellhop
chasing her.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.924
The camera fell out of my hand,
hit the ground,

39:04.008 --> 39:05.342
and took the picture by itself.

39:08.846 --> 39:11.432
What was that for?

39:11.515 --> 39:12.767
For caring about me enough

39:12.850 --> 39:14.393
to try and be something
that you're not.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.272
You could do a lot better
than me, Janet.

39:18.355 --> 39:20.941
You know
Jack's award-winning play?

39:21.025 --> 39:24.570
It's about sheep.

39:24.653 --> 39:27.782
(chuckles)
All right, what about sheep?

39:27.865 --> 39:29.617
You know, what they think about

39:29.700 --> 39:32.119
{\an3}while they're waiting
in line to be slaughtered.

39:33.579 --> 39:35.539
I think I'm doing all right.

39:36.624 --> 39:37.625
Hmm.

39:37.708 --> 39:38.918
Not that one.

39:39.001 --> 39:39.877
I like that one.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.504
{\an1}I thought you didn't like
being photographed?

39:41.587 --> 39:44.131
{\an3}I don't. But the guy
who took this picture,

39:44.215 --> 39:46.801
he brings out the best in me.

39:48.010 --> 39:50.679
Oh! Mmm...

40:06.695 --> 40:07.822
{\an3}Hey, what are you
doing here?

40:07.905 --> 40:09.657
I'm here to see Gina.

40:09.740 --> 40:13.619
{\an3}For, like, moral support?
Show her you're in her corner?

40:13.702 --> 40:15.454
Yeah, basically.

40:15.538 --> 40:18.374
That's nice.

40:21.710 --> 40:26.298
{\an1}You know, Dave, I'm sensing
a little hostility here.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.345
Are we friends?

40:31.428 --> 40:32.972
Yes, we are.

40:33.055 --> 40:36.851
If I ask you to do something
as a friend, would you do it?

40:36.934 --> 40:38.644
That depends.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.900
I want you to leave.

40:44.984 --> 40:47.403
We're supposed to be here
to support Gina.

40:47.486 --> 40:48.904
I am.

40:55.202 --> 40:56.912
{\an1}All right.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.043
(applause)

41:03.127 --> 41:05.796
{\an5}ANNOUNCER:
Tasha, thank you for showing us
the routine.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.883
Okay, next up to audition
is Gina Kincaid.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.054
Gina Kincaid.

41:18.851 --> 41:19.768
Gina Kincaid.

41:19.852 --> 41:21.562
{\an1}Gina!

41:21.645 --> 41:24.231
{\an6}Please help!
A girl just threw up
and fainted in there!

41:24.315 --> 41:27.401
Gina? Call a doctor.
Get a doctor, please!

41:27.484 --> 41:32.573
Gina, hey, Gina, Gina.

41:32.656 --> 41:34.366
Gina?

41:38.829 --> 41:40.915
I just...
I can't see you tonight.

41:40.998 --> 41:41.916
Why not?

41:41.999 --> 41:43.250
Because I just can't.

41:43.334 --> 41:44.919
What kind of answer is that?

41:45.002 --> 41:46.754
It's the only one
I can give you.

41:46.837 --> 41:48.505
No, it's not even close.

41:57.514 --> 42:02.937
{\an1}He took my wallet;
he knows where we live.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.772
Which is why
the police have assigned

42:04.855 --> 42:06.440
extra patrols to the area.

42:06.523 --> 42:08.234
Besides, they said

42:08.317 --> 42:09.944
it was probably
a random attack, right?

42:10.027 --> 42:12.529
Meaning what?
It was nothing personal?

42:13.864 --> 42:15.616
{\an3}Look, Kel, I know
what happened

42:15.699 --> 42:16.784
to you is unimaginable,

42:16.867 --> 42:18.953
and I'm not trying to take away
from that,

42:19.036 --> 42:21.121
but you weren't stalked.

42:21.205 --> 42:24.291
So, most likely, your attacker
won't target you again.

42:24.375 --> 42:27.795
Did you know that if a crime
isn't solved within 48 hours,

42:27.878 --> 42:29.046
it usually never is.

42:30.547 --> 42:32.800
It's been 116, Donna,

42:32.883 --> 42:34.301
and a half.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.470
You haven't slept at all
since then, have you?

42:36.553 --> 42:37.930
(knocking)

42:38.013 --> 42:40.557
I got it.

42:42.893 --> 42:43.811
{\an3}Who is it?

42:43.894 --> 42:45.688
It's Dylan. Open up.

42:45.771 --> 42:47.690
{\an1}DONNA:
Hey.

42:47.773 --> 42:49.775
{\an1}Hi. Um,
how's she doing?

42:49.858 --> 42:51.110
She needs sleep.

42:51.193 --> 42:52.278
Did you get it?

42:52.361 --> 42:53.279
{\an1}Yep.

42:53.362 --> 42:54.697
{\an3}Get what?

43:01.620 --> 43:02.955
Kel, you don't need that.

43:03.038 --> 43:03.664
Be careful. It's loaded.

43:03.747 --> 43:05.791
Do you know what random means?

43:05.874 --> 43:07.501
No pattern or purpose.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.128
No meaning.

43:09.211 --> 43:11.463
{\an1}What happened to her
could happen to anybody.

43:11.547 --> 43:12.881
Just because it happened once

43:12.965 --> 43:14.466
doesn't mean
it won't happen again.

43:14.550 --> 43:15.551
This time, I will be ready.
