What are you
talking about?

00:06.173 --> 00:08.132
JASPER:
You accidentally
ran over my uncle.

00:08.175 --> 00:10.051
I didn't know Joe myself.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.470

We're a band. All for one

00:16.517 --> 00:17.476
Laurel Cooper.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.560
You're a music producer?

00:18.602 --> 00:19.979
And I'm interested
in signing you.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.272
Oh, my God. I can't
wait to tell the band.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.149
I'm not interested
in signing the band.

I'm with Dixon now.

You're obviously
not really dating.

Mr. Cannon.
You can't do this.

01:07.693 --> 01:08.777
This doesn't concern you.
Yes, it does.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.029
The only reason
Liam did this

01:10.070 --> 01:11.030
is because...

01:11.071 --> 01:13.114
because Mr. Cannon
sexually harassed me.

10:34.926 --> 10:37.178
I may not look like a bruiser,
but I can bruise if need be.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.513
How did you hear
about what happened?

10:38.555 --> 10:40.557
People were talking about
it in history class.

10:40.599 --> 10:42.225
What?!
GIRL:
Naomi?

10:42.267 --> 10:43.560
You're doing the right thing.

10:43.602 --> 10:44.894
Cannon is a jerk.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.813
I hope he never teaches again.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.408
Hey.

10:59.951 --> 11:00.743
You okay?

11:00.785 --> 11:03.246
Not really.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.582
I don't want to talk about it.

11:05.624 --> 11:08.335
Oh, Ade, come on.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.253
It's me here.
What's going on?

11:12.213 --> 11:15.383
Okay, don't say
anything to anybody yet,

11:15.425 --> 11:17.093
You know
that record producer Laurel?

11:17.135 --> 11:18.094
Yeah.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.887
She wants to make
an album with me.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.431
So a huge record
producer wants

11:21.473 --> 11:22.932
to make all your
dreams come true?

11:22.974 --> 11:26.269
Oh, okay, now I get
the whole glum thing.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.480
It means ditching the band.

11:28.522 --> 11:32.442
Yeah, they'll probably
be really upset.

11:32.484 --> 11:35.320
But the thing is

11:35.362 --> 11:37.780
I think any one of them
would jump on this

11:37.822 --> 11:39.282
if they were in your shoes.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.492
Yeah?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.619
Maybe.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.621
But it's not just that.

11:44.663 --> 11:45.955
What is it then?

11:45.997 --> 11:47.207
Navid, come on.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.750
You of all people should know.

11:49.792 --> 11:50.835
I mean,
you didn't think

11:50.877 --> 11:53.171
I was ready to get back
into the acting thing.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.964
And as scary as that world is,

11:55.006 --> 11:58.801
the music industry is
a hundred times worse.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.762
I don't know if I can handle it.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.097
You can.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.641
I mean, would
the old Adrianna

12:04.683 --> 12:06.017
have taken this
decision so seriously?

12:07.519 --> 12:08.853
Probably not.
Exactly.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.522
Just the fact that you're
thinking about it so hard,

12:10.564 --> 12:11.772
it's proof that you changed.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.484
Thanks.
Yeah.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.819
Do you mind not mentioning
this to anybody yet?

12:16.861 --> 12:19.489
I kinda want to break it
to the band myself.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.074
Sure, of course.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.369

12:24.411 --> 12:27.830
Yo, the Blaze is gonna be way
less lame with your intro music.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.874
Seriously,
it sounds dope.

12:29.916 --> 12:30.917
Oh, well, thank you.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.835
Deejaying is
a passion of mine.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.004
Okay, so show me
how you do this.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.924
Okay. Well, uh,
deejaying is

12:37.965 --> 12:39.175
a very, very
important job.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.301
Is that true?

12:40.343 --> 12:43.304
Yeah. Now say you're
doing a party, right?

12:43.346 --> 12:44.472
Mm-hmm.

12:44.514 --> 12:48.351
And there's a couple,
and they're dancing.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.811

by the minute.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.146

12:55.483 --> 12:56.859
Uh-oh.
Yeah.

12:56.901 --> 13:01.030
Now, if you play
the wrong song...

you were one of the hottest
new deejays in town

21:46.139 --> 21:48.474
what better way to say thank you
than to break up?

21:48.515 --> 21:49.767
Huh?

34:04.626 --> 34:08.505
after everything that's
happened with Naomi,

34:08.547 --> 34:12.384
but... nope.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.177
That was a mistake.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.722
He basically told me
it was never gonna happen.

34:16.763 --> 34:19.139
Well, then he's an idiot.

34:19.181 --> 34:21.893
'Cause you're amazing, Ivy.

34:21.935 --> 34:23.228
You don't have to say that.

34:23.268 --> 34:24.563
I know I don't.

34:24.603 --> 34:25.856
But, on a brighter note,

34:25.898 --> 34:28.358
now I can
actually move on

34:28.400 --> 34:31.194
'cause I am totally
over that guy.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.946
(both laughing)

34:32.987 --> 34:34.406
Well, I'm happy
to hear that.

34:34.447 --> 34:35.574
Thank you.

34:35.614 --> 34:38.994
No. I'm really
happy to hear that.

34:41.286 --> 34:43.831
'Cause I like you, Ivy.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.337
So, uh...

34:49.379 --> 34:52.090
Any chance you'll let
your fake ex-boyfriend

34:52.130 --> 34:53.967
take you out on a real date?

34:54.009 --> 34:57.429
(laughing)

34:57.470 --> 35:00.265
Yes. Yes.

35:00.306 --> 35:03.268
I mean, why not?
Right?

35:03.309 --> 35:05.478
Cool.

35:05.520 --> 35:08.440
Cool.

35:08.481 --> 35:11.568
Hi. Uh, can I get
a chai latte, please?

35:11.610 --> 35:12.694
Thanks.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.079
Uh, excuse me.
Shouldn't you be

35:22.120 --> 35:24.664
sharing shopping tips
with Lady Gaga right now?

35:24.706 --> 35:26.583
I left the party early.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.085
I'm just writing a song.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.963
Yeah? Oh.
What's it about?

35:31.004 --> 35:34.049
It's...

35:34.091 --> 35:36.551
It's kind of
about being cheated on.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.889
I just caught Gia
with her ex.

35:43.433 --> 35:44.726
Ah.

35:50.107 --> 35:51.441
I'm really sorry.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.151
It happens.

35:53.192 --> 35:55.988
It sucks, but you survive.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.990
You did, right?

35:59.950 --> 36:02.243
Yeah.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.162
Yeah, you survive.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.833
What?

36:07.874 --> 36:09.459
(chuckles)

36:09.501 --> 36:12.337
Now, can I just say,
though, that...

36:12.378 --> 36:14.006
I'm really proud
of you, Ade.

36:14.047 --> 36:16.716
Just seeing you here alone,
I mean, drinking your coffee,

36:16.758 --> 36:18.176
writing your songs...

36:18.217 --> 36:20.386
Seems like such an undramatic
way to handle all this.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.430
Which does prove
my earlier point.

36:22.472 --> 36:23.598
You are different.

36:25.017 --> 36:27.060
Nah, you can handle all this.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.561
Easy.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.480
(chuckles)

36:30.522 --> 36:32.565
Do you want to sit
and have some coffee with me?

36:32.607 --> 36:35.485
Or on you on your way to see
the president or something?

36:35.527 --> 36:37.821
(laughing)

36:37.863 --> 36:39.489
Uh, no. Obama can wait.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.573
(laughs)

36:40.615 --> 36:42.117
Can I see
what you're writing?

36:43.618 --> 36:46.371
No judgments, though.
It's early. Okay?

36:46.412 --> 36:48.289
Okay. No judgments.
Promise.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.878
What's the title?

36:52.919 --> 36:54.379
Cool.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.802
You're still here?

37:00.844 --> 37:03.055
(laughs)

37:03.096 --> 37:06.683
Couldn't exactly drive
home in my condition.

37:06.725 --> 37:10.062
Hell, I couldn't even
find my car.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.980
(laughs)

37:15.108 --> 37:17.276
(sighs)

37:17.318 --> 37:20.072
Look...

37:20.113 --> 37:22.074
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you in advance

37:22.115 --> 37:24.826
about Dixon and Adrianna
coming to the party.

37:24.868 --> 37:26.369
To be honest,
I didn't--

37:26.411 --> 37:28.621
I didn't even
think about it.

37:28.663 --> 37:31.541
You need to understand
I'm not exactly

37:31.583 --> 37:34.502
a consequences oriented
kind of woman.

37:34.544 --> 37:35.587
Hmm.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.714
Never have been.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.507
And if you don't want
to hang out with me

37:39.549 --> 37:41.760
because of that, I get it.

37:41.801 --> 37:45.097
Yeah. Well...

37:45.138 --> 37:47.265
I'm a big boy.

37:47.306 --> 37:50.309
And I don't need a babysitter.

37:50.351 --> 37:53.271
Good. 'Cause I've never been
any good at that, either.

37:53.312 --> 37:55.190
(laughs)

37:56.942 --> 37:58.193
Can I have some of that?

38:00.112 --> 38:02.321
We salute you.

38:02.363 --> 38:03.531
(laughs)

38:14.793 --> 38:16.044
Dad?

38:19.965 --> 38:22.508
Whe... When did you get out?

38:22.550 --> 38:25.762
Not that long ago.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.473
Between you and me,

38:28.514 --> 38:31.977
prison's not all
it's cracked up to be.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.352
As soon as I heard
you were in California,

38:33.394 --> 38:35.897
I took the first bus out here.

38:40.359 --> 38:41.486
I missed you, kid.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.332
Well, look at you.

38:54.373 --> 38:56.626
(laughs)

38:56.668 --> 38:58.253
What? What are you doing--

39:02.507 --> 39:04.383
(yawns)

39:20.566 --> 39:22.443
(panting)

39:33.163 --> 39:35.040
(panting)

39:58.813 --> 40:00.690
(sighs)

40:13.953 --> 40:15.955
(students whispering)

40:38.270 --> 40:40.063
Hey.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.487
I'm a terrible person.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.698
You're not.

40:50.740 --> 40:52.909
I am.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.287
I don't even know
how this happened.

40:55.328 --> 40:59.082
I said one thing.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.959
And it...

41:01.000 --> 41:03.795
spiraled completely
out of control.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.214
And then...

41:06.256 --> 41:08.007
before you could
say anything,

41:08.049 --> 41:10.302
or come forward,

41:10.343 --> 41:13.805
the secret just took
on a life of its own.

41:13.846 --> 41:16.766
And-And became
this nightmare

41:16.808 --> 41:18.726
that you couldn't
wake up from.

41:20.853 --> 41:24.732
Trust me, I get it.
