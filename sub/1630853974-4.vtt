21:56.732 --> 21:57.775
- Shh.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.193
[whispering]
Don't tell nobody.

21:59.193 --> 22:00.528
Got a Nintendo?

22:00.528 --> 22:02.363
Want one?
- Yes!

22:02.363 --> 22:04.114
- I'll see what I can do,
come on.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.617
- Oh, you're--you're
Mike Tyson!

22:06.617 --> 22:08.160
- Yeah.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.828
- Yo, can I get
a autograph, man?

22:09.828 --> 22:11.455
- That depends.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.415
How many these Nintendos
do you guys got here?

22:13.415 --> 22:14.834
- Oh--

22:14.834 --> 22:17.545
TYSON: I'll take all of them.
And, uh, throw a copy

22:17.545 --> 22:19.755
of Mike Tyson's Punch Out
in there too.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.006
- Oh...

22:21.006 --> 22:22.967
you don't know?

22:22.967 --> 22:25.177
- Don't know what?

22:33.102 --> 22:35.437
They took me off the cover,

22:35.437 --> 22:38.774
replaced me with some
white guy named Mr. Dream.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.862
But the truth is, the name
Mike Tyson didn't mean shit

22:42.862 --> 22:44.947
till I started
beating people.

22:44.947 --> 22:47.950
I whoop somebody's ass,
they pay me for it.

22:47.950 --> 22:50.619
I fuck my life up
and turn it to a Broadway show,

22:50.619 --> 22:51.912
you guys pay me for it.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.414
[laughter]

22:53.414 --> 22:55.416
Every car, every house,

22:55.416 --> 22:58.335
video game with my face on it.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.546
I thought it meant I had power.

23:00.546 --> 23:04.800
That I mattered,
that a Black man mattered.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.760
But then I lost my belt.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.179
Mr. fuckin' Dream
took everything away.

23:12.933 --> 23:14.894
11 days later,
I lost my sister.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.896
- Aw!
- Yeah.

23:17.896 --> 23:20.024
Never got to see Nisey again.

23:20.024 --> 23:22.401
Tell her I love her.

23:22.401 --> 23:26.947
If I wasn't the champ,
who the fuck was I?

23:26.947 --> 23:28.949
I thought I hit rock bottom.

23:28.949 --> 23:31.035
But little did I know,

23:31.035 --> 23:34.204
shit was about to get worse.
