WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:02.333
-An assault.
-Yes.

00:02.400 --> 00:05.433
He just came up and totally
punched me, in my face.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.667
He choked me first.

00:07.734 --> 00:08.967
Let me tell you
something, sir.

00:09.033 --> 00:10.834
The way he's laughing
at me over here, come on.

00:10.900 --> 00:13.266
This-- it's made to make me
look like a bad guy.

00:13.333 --> 00:15.667
You're making yourself
look like a bad guy.

00:15.734 --> 00:18.166
[narrator]
<i>This is </i>Judy Justice.

00:18.233 --> 00:20.433
[upbeat music]

00:35.333 --> 00:38.100
[narrator] <i>Previously</i>
<i>on </i>Judy Justice...

00:38.166 --> 00:40.100
He'd chase my cats away
from their food.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.133
When they were trying to eat,

00:41.200 --> 00:42.834
he'd open his door
and he'd run out

00:42.900 --> 00:44.700
and he'd yell at 'em
and scream at 'em,

00:44.767 --> 00:46.467
and they'd have to run away
and wouldn't be able to eat.

00:46.533 --> 00:47.467
-[Judy] Okay.
-I've got a video

00:47.533 --> 00:49.166
-that shows it.
-Just, just a second.

00:49.233 --> 00:50.500
What I'm asking you is,

00:50.567 --> 00:52.767
if you've got a video
to show that,

00:52.834 --> 00:53.767
-Mr. Schulze--
-Yes, ma'am.

00:53.834 --> 00:54.867
[raises voice]
why didn't you

00:54.934 --> 00:56.433
just bring the food inside?

00:56.500 --> 00:57.567
I didn't bring the food inside

00:57.633 --> 01:00.667
because the two cats
couldn't come in at that time,

01:00.734 --> 01:02.166
so I had to feed 'em outside!

01:02.233 --> 01:04.500
What do you mean, they couldn't
come in at that time?

01:04.567 --> 01:05.967
-When we started--
-That's what I mean!

01:06.033 --> 01:07.800
They couldn't come in
at that time.

01:07.867 --> 01:10.367
Kevin, would you have a
conversation with the plaintiff

01:10.433 --> 01:11.834
and tell him
that there's only one person

01:11.900 --> 01:13.166
that raises their voice here?

01:13.233 --> 01:14.233
[Varlin] Thank you.

01:15.266 --> 01:16.867
[whispers] You don't wanna
raise your voice at the judge.

01:16.934 --> 01:17.934
Okay.

01:18.934 --> 01:20.000
And I just
wanna let you know

01:20.066 --> 01:22.734
-that when you display a temper--
-I'm already the bad guy here.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.700
[Judy] When you display--

01:24.767 --> 01:27.533
just a second, when you
display a temper in here--

01:27.600 --> 01:28.633
[Don scoffs]

01:28.700 --> 01:30.467
I'm trying to help you, sir.

01:30.533 --> 01:32.166
-[Don] All right.
-When you display

01:32.233 --> 01:33.934
a temper in here,

01:34.000 --> 01:35.967
that does not sit well
with the person

01:36.033 --> 01:37.800
-who has to adjudicate--
-[Don] I agree.

01:37.867 --> 01:38.700
Just feels like

01:38.767 --> 01:40.233
I'm already being made out
to be the bad guy here.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.066
Just a second.
I haven't even gotten to--

01:42.133 --> 01:43.867
to his side of the story yet.

01:43.934 --> 01:44.934
[scoffs] All right.

01:46.533 --> 01:48.800
[narrator]
<i>And now, the conclusion.</i>

01:48.867 --> 01:52.934
<i>Don Schulze is suing</i>
<i>his neighbor Varlin Davoudi</i>

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
<i>for assault,</i>
<i>extortion, and harassment.</i>

01:56.066 --> 02:00.433
Now, what I'm telling you is,
this is a social situation

02:00.500 --> 02:04.166
and what you've been doing
for 15 years with your cats,

02:04.233 --> 02:06.934
I don't give
a rat's behind about.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.900
You had a neighbor,
and clearly,

02:08.967 --> 02:10.900
you were used to doing things
a certain way.

02:10.967 --> 02:15.233
I have no idea whether
the prior tenants in that place,

02:15.300 --> 02:18.667
well, he says he has
a prior tenant sitting here.

02:18.734 --> 02:21.400
Were you there prior to
the Davoudis moving in?

02:21.467 --> 02:22.734
-[Gricelda] Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Okay.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.100
So, she's gonna testify
on behalf of the defendant.

02:26.166 --> 02:28.266
So I don't know whether
you've had problems

02:28.333 --> 02:30.600
with other people
who live there,

02:30.667 --> 02:33.700
with your semi-feral cats.

02:33.767 --> 02:35.667
I don't know, but if you have,

02:35.734 --> 02:38.100
and if you live in
such close proximity,

02:38.166 --> 02:40.467
that's selfish,
and not being a good neighbor.

02:40.533 --> 02:41.567
-[Varlin] Mm-mm.
-I agree.

02:41.633 --> 02:43.100
[Judy] And if you had
prior warning about it,

02:43.166 --> 02:45.433
and evidently, I don't think
she came here for nothing

02:45.500 --> 02:47.633
to tell me what a terrific
neighbor you are.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.500
Otherwise, she'd be sitting
on that side.

02:49.567 --> 02:51.400
So you've had this problem before.

02:51.467 --> 02:54.000
-Mm-mm.
-[Judy] The Davoudis moved in

02:54.066 --> 02:57.200
subsequent to this neighbor,
and they were older people.

02:57.266 --> 02:59.066
And they were
older sick people

02:59.133 --> 03:01.000
because his father passed away.

03:01.066 --> 03:03.834
His mother is clearly,
based upon what he told me--

03:03.900 --> 03:05.200
-That's right.
-[Judy] --not well.

03:05.266 --> 03:07.066
You clearly had a
father situation

03:07.133 --> 03:08.066
that you were dealing with,

03:08.133 --> 03:09.800
and should have been
more sensitive,

03:09.867 --> 03:12.867
but he told you
that there was an odor

03:12.934 --> 03:16.367
created by your cats
that you clearly got used to.

03:16.433 --> 03:17.867
-[Varlin] Mm-mm.
-And it didn't bother you,

03:17.934 --> 03:20.166
but it bothered your neighbors,
not only this neighbor.

03:20.233 --> 03:23.367
So was he being unreasonable?
I don't know. I don't know.

03:23.433 --> 03:26.133
I think that when you put food
out for animals,

03:26.200 --> 03:28.433
that encourages them
on a regular basis,

03:28.500 --> 03:30.567
once or twice a day,
to come to your house,

03:30.633 --> 03:33.000
and you don't have a litter box
outside for them,

03:33.066 --> 03:34.633
and you live in close proximity,

03:34.700 --> 03:36.433
they're going to
urinate and defecate,

03:36.500 --> 03:39.166
and they're not always gonna
pick your side of the house.

03:39.233 --> 03:41.433
So all you have to do is,
if you love the cats,

03:41.500 --> 03:42.734
then you either
bring 'em inside

03:42.800 --> 03:45.066
and provide
a place for them to eat

03:45.133 --> 03:47.200
so they'll wanna
come in there and eat,

03:47.266 --> 03:48.667
and they'll get used to
the litter box,

03:48.734 --> 03:51.233
or you rehome them.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.867
And that's not
a legal interpretation, sir.

03:53.934 --> 03:56.233
-that's a social situation.
-[Don] Yes, ma'am.

03:56.300 --> 04:00.300
We live in a community
where we have certainly

04:00.367 --> 04:03.033
forgotten about
a certain amount of civility

04:03.100 --> 04:07.066
that doesn't necessarily
always require a legal judgment.

04:07.133 --> 04:10.467
If my neighbor--
stand up, please.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.100
And your last name is?

04:12.166 --> 04:13.233
Carillo.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.967
How long did you live
as Mr. Schulze's neighbor?

04:16.033 --> 04:19.033
I moved in September 2013,

04:19.100 --> 04:22.700
and I moved out December 2017.

04:22.767 --> 04:25.266
[Judy] Did you ever have
any issues surrounding his cats?

04:25.333 --> 04:26.266
Yes, I did.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.667
[Judy] Tell me about it.

04:27.734 --> 04:28.667
The same.

04:28.734 --> 04:30.633
Did you discuss it
with Mr. Schulze?

04:30.700 --> 04:33.700
[Gricelda] We sure did.
We exchanged messages.

04:33.767 --> 04:35.400
We exchanged emails.

04:35.467 --> 04:36.600
[Judy] I'd like to
take a look at them.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.033
And you moved out in--

04:38.100 --> 04:40.467
-December, 2017.
-[Gricelda] December '17.

04:40.533 --> 04:42.767
[Judy] I'd like to see
the emails, please.

04:53.600 --> 04:57.900
Okay. So this was
February 20th of 2015

04:57.967 --> 05:00.133
when she first wrote to you,
'cause evidently

05:00.200 --> 05:03.000
you were complaining that
her dog pooped in the backyard.

05:03.066 --> 05:06.767
And she says, "My dog does not
relieve itself in the backyard.

05:06.834 --> 05:07.934
Any poop that you're seeing

05:08.000 --> 05:10.633
is from your three
or four cats that you feed.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.934
I'm sure they also go
in the back and poop.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.900
I have also seen poop
in the front lawn,

05:14.967 --> 05:17.166
and I thought it was
very inconsiderate of you

05:17.233 --> 05:19.266
to have put the poop
under the bench.

05:19.333 --> 05:21.300
I assume that that's
what happened."

05:21.367 --> 05:23.834
You found some sort of poop
under a bench?

05:23.900 --> 05:25.500
-Yes.
-"I'm sure that since

05:25.567 --> 05:26.500
you have been living here

05:26.567 --> 05:29.500
for so long, you have
come across this poop issue.

05:29.567 --> 05:31.467
Therefore the poop
you've seen in the backyard

05:31.533 --> 05:34.400
is cat poop, so if you continue
to see poop in the backyard,

05:34.467 --> 05:37.000
keep in mind
that it belongs to the cats."

05:37.066 --> 05:39.867
What her statement is
is a simple one.

05:39.934 --> 05:42.500
You've been aware that
having semi-feral cats

05:42.567 --> 05:45.233
has caused problems for
your neighbors for a long time.

05:45.300 --> 05:48.934
And, sit down. Okay.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.567
It's just an issue
that I wanted to clarify.

05:52.633 --> 05:54.967
Now, Mr. Schulze,
Mr. Davoudi has told me

05:55.033 --> 05:56.734
what his version
of what happened

05:56.800 --> 05:58.834
-on the 29th of November.
-Correct.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.467
Now understanding
that there was some

06:00.533 --> 06:02.233
negative history
between the two of you,

06:02.300 --> 06:04.266
I want you to tell me
your version of what happened.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.367
He started
with my family first,

06:06.433 --> 06:08.800
and when I was not here,
he was constantly harassing

06:08.867 --> 06:10.066
-my mom and my sister--
-[Judy] Shh.

06:10.133 --> 06:11.467
[Varlin] --sending texts to me.

06:11.533 --> 06:15.300
Shh. I understand
that there was friction

06:15.367 --> 06:16.967
-between the two of you.
-Mm-mm.

06:17.033 --> 06:19.433
[Judy] And the friction
between the two of you

06:19.500 --> 06:21.367
surrounded the cats.

06:21.433 --> 06:23.000
With my mom, mostly.

06:23.066 --> 06:25.000
[Judy] Well, the texts
were not with your mom.

06:25.066 --> 06:27.767
Well, before me, it was
my sister and my mom, yes.

06:27.834 --> 06:29.734
-Then I could go--
-I'm talking about just you.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.100
-Correct.
-Your mom and your sister

06:31.166 --> 06:33.000
-aren't here.
-[Varlin] Correct.

06:33.066 --> 06:34.100
This incident involved
the two of you.

06:34.166 --> 06:36.867
I want you just to tell me
what happened the day

06:36.934 --> 06:40.667
that you saw the plaintiff
working in his garage.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.867
Right. Actually,
he was working.

06:41.934 --> 06:43.600
He had blocked--
I have pictures of it.

06:43.667 --> 06:45.000
He had blocked our garage.

06:45.066 --> 06:46.867
That was when I was,
came in with the car.

06:46.934 --> 06:48.734
So I couldn't park in.
So I backed up.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.734
I parked on the street, which
he usually blocks or driving--

06:52.800 --> 06:53.834
[Judy] Not usually.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.133
So that day, he was working
in the garage--

06:56.200 --> 06:57.934
-Mm-mm.
-[Judy] So where was his stuff

06:58.000 --> 06:59.834
that you couldn't pull
into your garage?

06:59.900 --> 07:01.667
[Varlin] On our side
of the garage, his garbage,

07:01.734 --> 07:03.467
and he had a ladder
working on it,

07:03.533 --> 07:04.467
so I couldn't park in.

07:04.533 --> 07:06.400
So I said, "Okay, whatever."
I didn't ask him to move.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.700
So I just backed up,
went on the, on the--

07:08.767 --> 07:10.200
parked on the street.

07:10.266 --> 07:12.500
So, now you're walking
up the garage--

07:12.567 --> 07:16.133
And I was walking by to
our back house where I sleep--

07:16.200 --> 07:18.166
-[Judy] Be very, very careful.
-Mm-mm.

07:18.233 --> 07:22.266
'Cause if I had had these
negative text messages with him,

07:22.333 --> 07:24.033
I wouldn't have been happy
with him.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.700
Especially since
I had to pull out

07:25.767 --> 07:27.767
and find a parking place
on the street.

07:27.834 --> 07:29.367
-So, let's understand--
-Which I don't mind.

07:29.433 --> 07:31.900
Let's understand,
you're not a saint.

07:31.967 --> 07:34.700
[dramatic music]

07:34.767 --> 07:36.633
A moment ago,
you said possibly--

07:36.700 --> 07:38.300
Parking Enforcement
thought it was--

07:38.367 --> 07:40.934
Just a sec,
but that's just nasty.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Only a nasty person
calls Parking Enforcement

07:44.066 --> 07:47.200
to have a tow, to have
a neighbor's car towed.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.467
If you could have gotten out-

07:48.533 --> 07:50.333
[dramatic music]

07:56.133 --> 07:58.800
[dramatic music]

08:00.166 --> 08:03.133
[narrator] <i>Don Schulze says</i>
<i>his neighbor Varlin Davoudi</i>

08:03.200 --> 08:04.967
<i>owes him for an assault.</i>

08:05.033 --> 08:06.567
<i>Varlin is countersuing</i>

08:06.633 --> 08:09.867
<i>for the same assault</i>
<i>and wrongfully towing his car.</i>

08:09.934 --> 08:11.767
So what happened
as you were walking in?

08:11.834 --> 08:14.000
He started ranting.
I don't know what--

08:14.066 --> 08:15.467
[Judy] You don't know
what he said,

08:15.533 --> 08:16.467
or you couldn't hear
what he said?

08:16.533 --> 08:17.533
I couldn't hear
what he was saying.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.367
He was just screaming
like he was now.

08:19.433 --> 08:20.266
He always does that.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.567
[Judy] Okay.
And then what happened?

08:21.633 --> 08:22.567
And then he just came up

08:22.633 --> 08:25.300
and totally punched me
right in front of the--

08:25.367 --> 08:27.834
when I was walking in toward--
towards my gate.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.100
Punched you where?

08:29.166 --> 08:30.033
In my face.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.800
[Judy] What had
precipitated that?

08:31.867 --> 08:33.600
[blows raspberry]
Ask him. I wouldn't know.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.600
That's why I actually texted.
I asked him three times.

08:35.667 --> 08:37.867
-Why did you do that?
-I'd like to see that.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.867
And he says he was
in a very bad state of mind.

08:40.934 --> 08:42.367
Okay. I'd like to see that.

08:42.433 --> 08:43.433
Right away.
He punched me--

08:43.500 --> 08:44.834
-[Judy] Just a second.
-That's where he starts.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.367
-[Judy] Okay.
-And I think one--

08:46.433 --> 08:48.367
and one continuation.

08:48.433 --> 08:50.266
Those are his text messages

08:51.767 --> 08:53.100
why he hit me.

08:59.367 --> 09:01.333
[Judy] Well, the first thing
that you say to him,

09:01.400 --> 09:03.500
Mr. Schulze, is,
"I'm really sorry

09:03.567 --> 09:04.734
that happened, Varlin."

09:04.800 --> 09:05.834
Yes, ma'am.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.367
He goes on, he said,
"I took the high road.

09:07.433 --> 09:10.333
I didn't file charges yet,
because again, I'm not a mean,

09:10.400 --> 09:13.600
deceiving violent person
and full of anger like you are.

09:13.667 --> 09:16.133
Could've hit you back so good,
for self-defense,

09:16.200 --> 09:17.867
knock you out,
and you know the rest.

09:17.934 --> 09:20.400
You act like a little
tattletale child.

09:20.467 --> 09:22.467
It's embarrassing
for a grown person.

09:22.533 --> 09:25.367
Choose your actions
and words wisely next time

09:25.433 --> 09:26.767
and how you treat people.

09:26.834 --> 09:30.033
Okay. I'm on the line right now
with my factor."

09:30.100 --> 09:33.333
And then you write back
a little while later, you say,

09:33.400 --> 09:35.500
"Tim, okay, you're right.

09:35.567 --> 09:38.934
I've been defensive, but
you have to realize, Varlin,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.400
three landlords have been
trying to get me out of here

09:41.467 --> 09:43.800
for the last 20 years.

09:43.867 --> 09:45.400
Then when your
parents moved in,

09:45.467 --> 09:47.400
I did everything
I could to help them.

09:47.467 --> 09:49.900
Then on top of the
stress of the landlord

09:49.967 --> 09:50.900
wanting me to leave,

09:50.967 --> 09:53.233
as nice of a guy
as he has been,

09:53.300 --> 09:55.333
I still knew
he wanted me to leave.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.567
That's when we had
issue of the cats

09:57.633 --> 10:00.000
and the cameras,
and the stress tripled.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.500
So when I started
texting the landlord,

10:02.567 --> 10:04.533
like a little tattletale kid,"

10:04.600 --> 10:07.734
oh, that was about the
stuff in the backyard,

10:07.800 --> 10:11.333
"I was really just not myself.
Everything was a blur.

10:11.400 --> 10:15.000
I was on autopilot,
stressed to the ultimate max.

10:15.066 --> 10:17.900
I just reacted to everything
the best I could,

10:17.967 --> 10:21.367
now thinking you're
something and everything else

10:21.433 --> 10:25.400
wanted me gone from
my home of forty years.

10:25.467 --> 10:26.567
So if you try to see things

10:26.633 --> 10:28.867
from my point of view
and the stress levels,

10:28.934 --> 10:32.433
maybe you can see why I may be
acting a little defensive.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.567
I'm sorry for this.
I didn't want it to be like this."

10:35.633 --> 10:36.533
And then you say to him,

10:36.600 --> 10:38.400
"I just don't know how
to shake the feeling

10:38.467 --> 10:41.800
that I'm not wanted and
that's a really powerful emotion

10:41.867 --> 10:44.567
that's not very nice and
not at all comfortable.

10:44.633 --> 10:47.667
Going to bed and waking up
every day with that feeling

10:47.734 --> 10:50.867
is like living each
waking moment in a kind of hell.

10:50.934 --> 10:53.066
So that's why
I've been defensive.

10:53.133 --> 10:57.233
Maybe you can try to understand that
and sympathize somewhat."

10:57.300 --> 10:59.133
"One last chance
to work this out.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.667
Otherwise, I will guarantee

11:00.734 --> 11:04.433
you will cost you way more
than my glasses."

11:04.500 --> 11:05.500
That's him talking to me.

11:05.567 --> 11:06.500
[Judy] Yeah.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.367
"See, after all this
and what you did,

11:08.433 --> 11:11.834
still being bigger man here
and being neighborly

11:11.900 --> 11:13.633
and trying to work it out."

11:13.700 --> 11:17.200
So when you punched him, did you
break his glasses, Mr. Schulze?

11:17.266 --> 11:18.333
I believe so, yes.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.800
[Judy] And then you paid him
for the glasses that you broke?

11:21.867 --> 11:23.066
He demanded that I pay him, yes.

11:23.133 --> 11:25.367
[Judy] And that's after
you apologized to him,

11:25.433 --> 11:26.367
right after the event.

11:26.433 --> 11:28.100
-Yeah, I apologized to him.
-You apologized to him,

11:28.166 --> 11:29.300
I'm sorry for what happened.

11:29.367 --> 11:32.367
And what you're explaining
to him in these emails

11:32.433 --> 11:35.734
is that you were under
a whole bunch of stress

11:35.800 --> 11:38.433
because the landlord is trying
to take your home away.

11:38.500 --> 11:43.200
And [shushes] and Mr. Davoudi
was complicit with the landlord

11:43.266 --> 11:45.233
in trying to
take your home away

11:45.300 --> 11:48.200
by reporting all this
vermin and flies-

11:48.266 --> 11:49.734
-[Don] Right.
-and stuff with the cats.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.800
And I assume that since
this has been going on

11:52.867 --> 11:57.200
for at least six or seven years,
because the defendant's witness

11:57.266 --> 12:00.800
testified that she had told you
about the disgusting filth

12:00.867 --> 12:04.667
that your semi-feral cats
were bringing around the house,

12:04.734 --> 12:06.800
you'd been knowing
this was going on.

12:06.867 --> 12:09.967
So that you'd been
in that stress for a long time.

12:10.033 --> 12:12.900
Now, you say
that when you walked up,

12:12.967 --> 12:14.166
he punched you in the face.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.233
-Correct.
-[Judy] How many times

12:15.300 --> 12:17.133
-did he punch you?
-Uh, once.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.333
[Judy] And then he went back
into his house.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.066
Right. He ran away.
He ran back.

12:21.133 --> 12:22.600
-[Judy] You called the police.
-[Varlin] I did.

12:22.667 --> 12:25.166
And I assume the police
came to you first.

12:25.233 --> 12:27.900
Yes. Because right away,
when I called, he came in

12:27.967 --> 12:29.367
and as I was gonna call
and said,

12:29.433 --> 12:30.767
"Well, I called,
I just canceled.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.600
Let's work this out."
That was his--

12:32.667 --> 12:35.000
So, Mr. Schulze,
based upon what I've heard

12:35.066 --> 12:37.700
and putting all the pieces together
and the texts together,

12:37.767 --> 12:40.266
I'm gonna address each thing
that was here.

12:40.333 --> 12:44.133
One, your complaint is for
3,500 dollars,

12:44.200 --> 12:46.800
money owed for filing
a false TRO.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.700
I don't believe that Mr. Davoudi
filed a false TRO.

12:49.767 --> 12:51.166
I believe that you punched him.

12:51.233 --> 12:52.600
And I don't believe
that he choked you.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.100
I believe that you punched him.

12:54.166 --> 12:56.166
And that's why
you apologized to him.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.867
So I'm dismissing
that part of your complaint.

12:58.934 --> 13:01.000
I'm dismissing
the part of your complaint

13:01.066 --> 13:02.400
that claims an assault.

13:02.467 --> 13:04.834
I believe that on that day,
because of the stress

13:04.900 --> 13:07.266
you were under,
for which you apologized,

13:07.333 --> 13:09.333
that you were the aggressor
in the assault.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.800
The next part of your complaint
talks about extortion.

13:12.867 --> 13:15.800
And that extortion is that
unless you pay for his glasses,

13:15.867 --> 13:17.667
he's going to go to the police.

13:17.734 --> 13:20.100
Well, since I believe
that you punched him first

13:20.166 --> 13:21.200
and broke his glasses--

13:21.266 --> 13:22.867
I have a picture
that shows my neck.

13:22.934 --> 13:24.834
[Judy] Just a second.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.100
So, you don't wanna see it?

13:26.166 --> 13:31.133
Sir, I don't wanna see it
'cause I don't believe it.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.266
Just a sec. I don't wanna see it
'cause I don't believe it.

13:35.333 --> 13:36.834
All right.

13:37.533 --> 13:40.433
Do you see what I mean?
I don't believe it.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.767
I don't believe that there were
marks on your neck

13:43.834 --> 13:44.734
that he caused.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.200
-Mm-mm.
-[Judy] I don't believe it.

13:46.266 --> 13:47.200
-[Varlin] Thank you.
-Well, the police thought--

13:47.266 --> 13:48.900
[Judy] So I'm eliminating--

13:48.967 --> 13:50.900
I believe that there were marks
on your neck.

13:50.967 --> 13:52.467
I just don't believe he did it.

13:52.533 --> 13:53.467
-[Varlin] Mm-mm.
-[chuckles]

13:53.533 --> 13:55.166
-That's what I-- that's what--
-Where are you drawing that conclusion?

13:55.233 --> 13:56.166
[Judy] Just a second--

13:56.233 --> 13:58.433
-He choked me first.
-[Judy] Just a second.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.867
He choked me first, ma'am.

13:59.934 --> 14:01.100
[Judy] Let me tell you
something, sir.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.867
You can say it
as many times as you like.

14:03.934 --> 14:05.633
-I wouldn't--
-[Judy] I don't believe it.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.400
-Why would I do--?
-[Judy] Beacuse it-- Why?

14:07.467 --> 14:09.000
I wouldn't just hit him.

14:09.066 --> 14:11.266
You are, sir,
your own worst enemy.

14:11.333 --> 14:12.400
[Don] All right.

14:12.467 --> 14:16.133
Because knowing who you are
based upon what I see here--

14:16.200 --> 14:18.767
-[Don] I understand.
-based upon what I see here--

14:18.834 --> 14:20.467
Yeah. Well, that whole thing
was trumped up

14:20.533 --> 14:21.734
-to make me angry.
-[Judy] Just a sec--

14:21.800 --> 14:23.867
-And get my-- get me riled up.
-[Judy] Not to me.

14:23.934 --> 14:24.867
The questions
that are being asked

14:24.934 --> 14:27.533
and the way he's laughing
at me over here, come on.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.667
It's made to make me look like
a bad guy and it's and it's--

14:30.734 --> 14:32.934
You're making yourself
look like a bad guy.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.600
-[Don] Yeah, but it's made--
-Mr. Schulze, Mr. Schulze,

14:35.667 --> 14:37.333
you're making yourself
look like a bad guy.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.100
I got a picture, I got-- I have a picture.
You said, "I don't wanna see it."

14:39.166 --> 14:40.200
[Judy] Just a sec, because--

14:40.266 --> 14:41.600
I got a video
that shows him aggressive,

14:41.667 --> 14:42.800
-being aggressive.
-[Judy] Now, just a sec--

14:42.867 --> 14:43.934
-Just a sec--
-You don't wanna

14:44.000 --> 14:45.200
-see that either.
-I would love to see

14:45.266 --> 14:47.333
a video of him choking you.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.333
-I have it.
-[Judy] You have it?

14:48.400 --> 14:50.367
No, I don't have
a video of him choking me.

14:50.433 --> 14:51.900
My DVR was new.

14:51.967 --> 14:54.033
-[Varlin laughs]
-[Judy] Just--

14:54.100 --> 14:57.700
just stop it.
I'm finishing my ruling.

14:57.767 --> 15:01.000
Kevin, tell him that we're quiet
now that I'm ruling.

15:03.066 --> 15:04.633
We're going to do
our ruling now.

15:04.700 --> 15:08.266
[dramatic music]

15:08.333 --> 15:12.200
Defendant's car
is probably about two feet

15:12.266 --> 15:15.800
over the cut in the street,
but there looks like

15:15.867 --> 15:18.367
more than sufficient room
to back out of a driveway.

15:18.433 --> 15:19.367
-[Don] Okay.
-Five feet.

15:19.433 --> 15:21.800
Shh. I didn't need any help.

15:21.867 --> 15:23.133
Does it look like I need help?

15:23.200 --> 15:24.700
No.

15:28.266 --> 15:30.934
[upbeat music]

15:35.367 --> 15:36.834
[narrator]
<i>Defendant Varlin Davoudi</i>

15:36.900 --> 15:39.300
<i>is countersuing his neighbor,</i>
<i>Don Schulze</i>

15:39.367 --> 15:41.934
<i>for an assault</i>
<i>and towing charges.</i>

15:42.000 --> 15:44.967
<i>Don claims he was the one</i>
<i>assaulted by Varlin.</i>

15:45.033 --> 15:46.433
Now, you paid
for the glasses

15:46.500 --> 15:47.934
'cause you broke the glasses.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.200
Now he filed a false
restraining order against you.

15:51.266 --> 15:53.333
-[Don] Mm-mm.
-[Judy] I'm dismissing that.

15:53.400 --> 15:57.633
And assault, I am granting you
a judgment on the assault.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.567
How much
were your attorney's fees?

15:59.633 --> 16:01.400
-Twenty-five hundred.
-[Judy sighs]

16:01.467 --> 16:03.734
[Judy] Did you seek medical
attention for the punch?

16:03.800 --> 16:04.734
[Varlin] No, I didn't.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.100
But actually,
up to this right now,

16:06.166 --> 16:08.066
my nose is still hurting,
to be honest.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.433
I want you to tell me
about the illegal tow.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.200
Do you have any proof
that the plaintiff

16:12.266 --> 16:13.834
caused your mother's car
to be illegally towed,

16:13.900 --> 16:15.133
and when did this happen?

16:15.200 --> 16:17.367
Yes, actually,
he admits he did it.

16:17.433 --> 16:18.567
In what year?

16:18.633 --> 16:20.266
[Varlin] Oh, uh, June 10th of this year.

16:20.333 --> 16:21.934
-Of this year?
-[Varlin] Just now. Yeah.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.166
Oh. I'd like to see
the text unless, Mr. Schulze,

16:25.233 --> 16:29.000
did at any time you cause
his mother's car to be towed?

16:29.066 --> 16:30.867
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] On what date?

16:30.934 --> 16:31.834
June 10th.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.033
Why?

16:33.100 --> 16:34.967
Because he blocked the driveway
with his mother's car.

16:35.033 --> 16:37.533
I couldn't get out,
had a doctor's appointment.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.467
Couldn't get to it.

16:38.533 --> 16:41.233
So I called the,
the Parking Enforcement.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.367
[Judy] Okay. Okay.
So, at what time of the day

16:44.433 --> 16:45.734
did his mother's car
block your driveway?

16:45.800 --> 16:47.233
I think it was around noon.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.600
Do you remember
that date, sir?

16:48.667 --> 16:51.400
Yes. Well,
he was parked from to the,

16:51.467 --> 16:52.667
the night before.

16:52.734 --> 16:54.033
-[Judy] Okay.
-[Varlin] He called the cops

16:54.100 --> 16:55.333
-twice that day.
-[Judy] Okay.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.533
Which is here.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.934
[Judy] I'm just gonna
ask you a question.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.834
The tow company
would not have towed the car

17:00.900 --> 17:03.433
unless the car
was blocking his car.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.233
I have pictures of it
from the tow company.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.533
I'd like to see it, please.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.934
[Varlin] It was. And they only
said the only reason he said--

17:09.000 --> 17:11.333
-Shh. Don't tell me what they said.
-He forced them.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.500
No, he forced them to do it.

17:12.567 --> 17:14.900
No. Did you understand
what I just said?

17:14.967 --> 17:16.066
-[Varlin] Yes.
-I said, don't tell me

17:16.133 --> 17:17.233
what they said to you.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.767
-Oh, okay.
-[Judy] Is this a picture

17:18.834 --> 17:20.633
that the tow company took?

17:20.700 --> 17:22.767
No, the--
the Parking Enforcement.

17:25.567 --> 17:27.000
Is this your mother's car?

17:27.066 --> 17:28.500
[Varlin] No. The one
that's right there.

17:28.567 --> 17:30.433
That's the one he's saying
was blocking the driveway,

17:30.500 --> 17:32.133
which is behind the wall,
if you see.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.667
[Judy] Mr. Schulze,
I'm gonna show this to you.

17:34.734 --> 17:35.734
I have a picture also.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.133
Yeah, and I'd like to see that.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.700
Could you get
Mr. Schulze's picture?

17:39.767 --> 17:40.800
[Don] Both of those.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.266
[Judy] I see it's from
a different angle.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.400
This is my question to you, sir.

17:51.467 --> 17:54.900
I see where the cut is
in the driveway.

17:54.967 --> 17:57.500
So when you said
he was blocking your car,

17:57.567 --> 18:00.266
it's this wall to his car.

18:00.333 --> 18:03.800
And I see
that the defendant's car

18:03.867 --> 18:08.033
is probably about two feet
over the cut

18:08.100 --> 18:09.967
-in the street.
-Three.

18:10.033 --> 18:12.033
But there looks like
more than sufficient room

18:12.100 --> 18:13.400
to back out of a driveway.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.300
-Okay.
-Five feet.

18:14.367 --> 18:17.133
Shh. I didn't need any help.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.333
Does it look like I need help?

18:18.400 --> 18:19.400
No.

18:19.467 --> 18:21.834
[Judy] It looks to a lay person

18:21.900 --> 18:27.200
that there's enough room here
to back out this car.

18:27.266 --> 18:29.900
Okay. My, my car's
on the other side.

18:29.967 --> 18:32.133
That's his car, straight ahead.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.433
I have to turn at an angle
to get my car out.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.200
Okay. So his car--

18:36.266 --> 18:38.100
-[Don] My car's to the right.
-This is his mother's car?

18:38.166 --> 18:39.867
-[Don] Right.
-So is what you're telling me,

18:39.934 --> 18:42.633
his car was blocking your car,
so you couldn't pull out?

18:42.700 --> 18:44.700
No, my car's on
the right of his car.

18:44.767 --> 18:47.967
So you could get out to here.

18:48.033 --> 18:49.066
[Don] Possibly, yes.

18:49.133 --> 18:50.600
Not possibly.
You could get out to here,

18:50.667 --> 18:52.133
so he wasn't blocking you.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.967
Your problem was
with his mother's car,

18:55.033 --> 18:57.033
who was two to three feet in.

18:57.100 --> 18:58.800
And what I'm saying to you is,

18:58.867 --> 19:02.333
based on your picture
that you gave me...

19:02.400 --> 19:03.367
[Don] Right.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.100
[Judy] ...based on your picture
that you gave me,

19:05.166 --> 19:09.500
you could have negotiated
yourself out of your garage

19:09.567 --> 19:11.800
and exited and made
your doctor's appointment.

19:11.867 --> 19:12.867
No, I could not.

19:12.934 --> 19:15.233
Well, a moment ago,
you said possibly.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.266
Well-- [scoffs]

19:16.333 --> 19:18.100
A moment ago,
you said possibly.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.033
The Parking Enforcement
thought it was--

19:20.100 --> 19:23.633
Just a sec--
but that's just nasty.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.767
You see,
if you could have gotten out,

19:25.834 --> 19:29.800
if you could have gotten out,
only a nasty person

19:29.867 --> 19:32.266
calls Parking Enforcement
to have it towed.

19:32.333 --> 19:34.166
-All right, okay, all right. All right.
-To have a neighbor's car towed,

19:34.233 --> 19:35.400
if you could've gotten out.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.500
Yes, ma'am.

19:36.567 --> 19:37.834
If you could've gotten out.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.300
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am. I'm done.

19:40.367 --> 19:41.467
-You are done.
-[Don] Yes, ma'am.

19:41.533 --> 19:43.600
Judgment for the defendant
on the counterclaim

19:43.667 --> 19:44.967
in the amount of 5,000 dollars.

19:45.033 --> 19:47.200
Your claim is dismissed.
We're done here.

19:47.266 --> 19:48.300
[Kevin] Court adjourned.

19:48.367 --> 19:49.834
[dramatic music]

19:49.900 --> 19:50.834
[Don sighs]

19:50.900 --> 19:55.233
Oh, I love Judge Judy.
She saw all the lies.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.533
Well, they make me look
like a bad guy.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.734
I've been there 42 years.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.633
And I'm obviously
the old grouchy neighbor.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.767
From beginning
till the end,

20:01.834 --> 20:02.767
everything she caught him.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.700
I didn't have to prove anything
because luckily,

20:05.767 --> 20:09.166
she's a smart judge
and caught him in all these lies.

20:09.233 --> 20:10.800
He thinks he can do
anything he wants.

20:10.867 --> 20:12.100
And that's just not the case.

20:12.166 --> 20:13.266
Well, as you saw,
he got violent

20:13.333 --> 20:14.300
with the judge also,
with him and the judge,

20:14.367 --> 20:15.500
and the judge just--

20:15.567 --> 20:17.033
Because the
defendant choked me.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.467
Quieted him down three times.

20:18.533 --> 20:19.967
And I had to punch him
to get him off me.

20:20.033 --> 20:20.967
Of course not.

20:21.033 --> 20:22.734
That's why I asked the judge
to show the pictures

20:22.800 --> 20:24.133
because he lied.
There's two marks here.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.867
He put the marks on himself
before the cops came.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.133
Well, there's no charges filed

20:28.200 --> 20:30.834
because he had broken glasses
and a mark on his face.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.100
And I had a mark on my neck.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.000
So we both would've gone to jail,

20:34.066 --> 20:35.100
and I didn't wanna go to jail,

20:35.166 --> 20:36.567
so neither one of us
pressed charges.

20:36.633 --> 20:39.767
Because he's made
a very insanitable

20:39.834 --> 20:41.367
living situation
for my parents,

20:41.433 --> 20:43.066
for myself, and my family.

20:43.133 --> 20:46.300
And he's just not doing what
a neighbor is supposed to do.

20:47.834 --> 20:49.800
That plaintiff
had quite the temper.

20:49.867 --> 20:51.367
He did. [laughs]

20:51.433 --> 20:53.834
That's just a prime example of,

20:53.900 --> 20:59.300
if you have a short fuse
and if you come to court,

20:59.367 --> 21:03.900
it's absolutely
the worst possible strategy

21:03.967 --> 21:08.367
not to chill out,
not to ensure that you display

21:08.433 --> 21:11.800
that kind of a temper
and that agitation

21:11.867 --> 21:13.500
to the person who's gonna be
trying your case.

21:13.567 --> 21:16.066
It's a good lesson for anybody
that goes to court.

21:16.133 --> 21:18.400
The sad thing about this case

21:18.467 --> 21:21.433
is that these people
are going to be neighbors.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.967
Plaintiff is definitely
not moving because

21:24.033 --> 21:27.066
you're not gonna move out of
a rent-controlled apartment

21:27.133 --> 21:28.266
like he enjoys.

21:28.333 --> 21:30.834
The defendant, I'm sure,
is hesitant to move his mother.

21:30.900 --> 21:32.433
How are these two people
gonna coexist?

21:32.500 --> 21:35.100
It's just so stressful
to have to live that way.

21:35.166 --> 21:36.967
And life is stressful enough, you know,

21:37.033 --> 21:39.800
without living that way.
It was sad. I was...

21:39.867 --> 21:41.834
I thought I could be
a peacemaker.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.900
Unfortunately, I could not.

21:43.967 --> 21:45.133
-Can't save 'em all.
-I tried.
