00:47.841 --> 00:50.435
<i>His name was J.B. Books,</i>

00:50.510 --> 00:53.104
<i>and he had
a matched pair of. 45s</i>

00:53.180 --> 00:54.613
<i>with antique ivory grips</i>

00:54.681 --> 00:56.581
<i>that were something
to behold...</i>

00:58.352 --> 01:00.286
<i>but he wasn't
an outlaw.</i>

01:00.354 --> 01:02.015
<i>Fact is,
for a while,</i>

01:02.089 --> 01:03.386
<i>he was a lawman.</i>

01:06.760 --> 01:10.355
<i>Long before I met Mr. Books,
he was a famous man.</i>

01:10.430 --> 01:13.831
<i>I guess his fame was
why somebody or other</i>

01:13.900 --> 01:15.390
<i>was always after him.</i>

01:18.205 --> 01:22.164
<i>The wild country
had taught him to survive.</i>

01:26.613 --> 01:28.308
Hyah!

01:28.382 --> 01:30.907
<i>He lived his life
and herded by himself.</i>

01:33.086 --> 01:35.418
<i>He had a credo
that went...</i>

01:35.489 --> 01:38.424
<i>I won't be
wronged. I won't be insulted.</i>

01:38.492 --> 01:40.926
<i>I won't be
laid a hand on.</i>

01:40.994 --> 01:43.428
<i>I don't do these things
to other people.</i>

01:43.497 --> 01:45.727
<i>I require
the same from them.</i>

03:07.447 --> 03:10.780
You hold it right there.

03:10.851 --> 03:12.409
Give me your wallet.

03:14.721 --> 03:17.952
Take it a little easy
with that cannon, mister.

03:20.460 --> 03:22.621
Just throw me
your wallet.

03:22.696 --> 03:23.720
Yes, sir,

03:23.797 --> 03:25.628
and a little
something extra.

03:30.470 --> 03:32.700
You done murdered me.

03:32.773 --> 03:34.206
No, but you're
going to have

03:34.274 --> 03:36.401
a long winter bellyache,
you boob.

03:36.476 --> 03:37.966
Give me that wallet.

03:44.050 --> 03:45.449
Just the wallet.

03:45.519 --> 03:47.578
I can hardly move.

03:47.654 --> 03:50.714
You done shot a hole
in my stomach.

03:53.693 --> 03:55.126
I appreciate that.

03:55.195 --> 03:57.186
You ain't going
to leave me here.

03:57.264 --> 03:58.697
Well, it's quite obvious

03:58.765 --> 04:01.165
that's what you were
going to do to me.

04:01.234 --> 04:04.499
Get out of the way.

04:04.571 --> 04:07.369
Mister, you better find
yourself another line of work.

04:07.441 --> 04:10.638
This one sure don't
fit your pistol.

04:53.385 --> 04:55.785
Hey, mister,
want a paper?

04:55.854 --> 04:58.322
Yeah, I will, son.

04:58.390 --> 04:59.880
Queen Victoria's dead.

05:03.829 --> 05:05.262
There you are.

05:05.330 --> 05:06.558
Thank you.

05:18.911 --> 05:20.503
Whoa.

05:20.579 --> 05:21.910
Hey!

05:21.980 --> 05:23.880
Hey, you!

05:23.949 --> 05:25.883
Hey, Methuselah,

05:25.951 --> 05:28.283
move that cack
out of the way.

05:28.353 --> 05:30.844
Are you
talking to me?

05:30.923 --> 05:33.016
Yeah, you dumb bastard.

05:33.092 --> 05:35.060
Move it, or I'll
deliver you something

05:35.127 --> 05:36.287
to remember me by.

05:36.361 --> 05:39.524
Well, now, pardon me
all to hell.

05:39.598 --> 05:40.690
Giddyup!

05:41.867 --> 05:43.300
Buster.

05:43.368 --> 05:44.300
Whoa.

05:44.369 --> 05:45.529
Try it.

05:49.274 --> 05:52.402
Come on, Jay, the old man
ain't worth the bullet.

05:52.478 --> 05:54.469
He looks
all tuckered out.

05:56.482 --> 05:58.279
Giddyup.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.811
You're right there, son.

06:48.500 --> 06:51.333
Doc Hostetler.

06:51.403 --> 06:53.803
John Bernard Books.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.134
You remembered.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.801
The newspapers
occasionally remind me.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.310
Wh-What was it,
15 years ago?

07:00.379 --> 07:02.745
The only time
I was ever hit...

07:02.814 --> 07:04.975
Right here
at the Acme Saloon.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.483
You killed two men.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.986
I'm damn lucky
you were around.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.420
That second one
nearly did me in,

07:11.490 --> 07:14.254
coming out of nowhere
like that.

07:14.326 --> 07:17.955
You must have the
constitution of an ox.

07:18.030 --> 07:19.895
Well, we'll see.

07:19.965 --> 07:21.899
That's what
I'm here for.

07:21.967 --> 07:23.025
Oh?

07:26.838 --> 07:30.535
About 10 days ago
in Creede, Colorado,

07:30.609 --> 07:32.941
I hadn't been feeling
up to snuff,

07:33.011 --> 07:35.775
so I went to see
a sawbones there.

07:35.847 --> 07:36.939
He, uh...

07:37.015 --> 07:39.779
Well, the next day
I got on my horse

07:39.851 --> 07:42.081
and took off
to find you.

07:42.154 --> 07:46.147
And what did my
colleague in Creede say?

07:46.225 --> 07:48.716
Examine me,
and I'll tell you.

07:48.794 --> 07:50.421
You don't trust me.

07:50.495 --> 07:52.793
Oh, Doc,
you saved my life.

07:52.864 --> 07:54.593
You don't trust
my profession.

07:54.666 --> 07:57.396
In my profession,
you trust too much,

07:57.469 --> 08:00.700
you don't celebrate
many birthdays.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.899
I kind of like it
around here.

08:05.377 --> 08:07.311
All right,
I'll examine you.

08:07.379 --> 08:10.940
Take your clothes off
down to your long johns.

08:13.418 --> 08:14.851
Now, I, uh...

08:14.920 --> 08:17.855
if I'm to know
what to look for,

08:17.923 --> 08:21.359
you'll have to tell me
what's ailing you.

08:21.426 --> 08:23.018
Well, I hurt, Doc,

08:23.095 --> 08:26.064
way down deep
in my back.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.564
Not all the time,

08:27.633 --> 08:29.999
but now and then
suddenly.

08:30.068 --> 08:32.866
Pain in the lumbar
vertebrae?

08:32.938 --> 08:34.496
Like sin.

08:34.573 --> 08:37.371
All right, whenever
you get ready,

08:37.442 --> 08:41.378
just... bend over
the table there,

08:41.446 --> 08:42.936
trapdoor down.

09:10.409 --> 09:11.501
Well?

09:13.845 --> 09:15.836
Books, every few days

09:15.914 --> 09:17.848
I have to tell a man
or a woman

09:17.916 --> 09:19.850
something
I don't want to.

09:19.918 --> 09:22.352
I've been practicing
medicine for 29 years,

09:22.421 --> 09:25.857
and I still don't know
how to do it well.

09:25.924 --> 09:28.916
Why don't you just
say it flat out?

09:28.994 --> 09:31.588
All right.

09:31.663 --> 09:33.563
You have a cancer...

09:33.632 --> 09:35.600
advanced.

09:43.108 --> 09:47.204
Is that what that fella
up at Creede told you?

09:47.279 --> 09:48.576
Yeah.

09:48.647 --> 09:51.445
And you didn't
believe him.

09:51.516 --> 09:53.882
No.

09:53.952 --> 09:55.886
Do you believe me?

09:55.954 --> 09:58.388
Can't you
cut it out, Doc?

09:59.958 --> 10:02.893
I'd have to gut you
like a fish.

10:04.429 --> 10:07.364
Well, what can you do?

10:09.968 --> 10:12.903
There's...
just, uh...

10:12.971 --> 10:15.496
very little
I can do.

10:17.776 --> 10:20.574
Uh, if... when
the pain gets too bad,

10:20.645 --> 10:22.510
I can give you
something.

10:24.783 --> 10:27.183
What you're trying
to tell me

10:27.252 --> 10:28.742
is that I...

10:28.820 --> 10:30.811
Yeah.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.092
Damn.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.720
I'm sorry, Books.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.397
You told me I was
strong as an ox.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.938
Well, even an ox dies.

10:51.343 --> 10:53.868
How much time
do I have?

10:55.013 --> 10:59.279
Two months...
six weeks... less.

10:59.351 --> 11:01.216
There's no way
to tell.

11:02.888 --> 11:05.550
Well, what can I...

11:05.624 --> 11:08.286
What will I
be able to do?

11:08.360 --> 11:11.386
Oh, anything
you want at first.

11:11.463 --> 11:14.557
Then, later on,
you won't want to.

11:16.802 --> 11:18.394
How much later?

11:18.470 --> 11:19.903
You'll know when.

11:19.971 --> 11:22.269
You'll have to
get off your feet

11:22.340 --> 11:23.661
and get some rest.

11:23.794 --> 11:26.592
Have you made any kind of
arrangements for a room?

11:26.664 --> 11:29.360
No. I just
got in town.

11:29.433 --> 11:31.867
You might try
the widow Rogers.

11:31.936 --> 11:34.803
She's got a place down
the street a fair piece.

11:34.872 --> 11:36.305
She takes in lodgers.

11:36.374 --> 11:37.807
She's a nice woman.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.274
She needs the help.

11:39.343 --> 11:41.277
I'll give it a try.

11:41.345 --> 11:42.778
Do me a favor.

11:42.847 --> 11:45.179
Don't tell anybody
I'm in town.

11:45.249 --> 11:48.810
Oh, no, but if I wanted
to go unnoticed,

11:48.886 --> 11:52.219
I don't think I'd walk
around with this thing.

11:55.159 --> 11:57.992
Stole it from
a whorehouse in Creede.

11:58.062 --> 11:58.994
Did you?

12:17.114 --> 12:19.582
Hello.

12:19.650 --> 12:22.312
This the Rogers place?

12:22.386 --> 12:25.287
Yeah.

12:25.356 --> 12:26.448
Ma!

12:27.691 --> 12:29.625
You can tell
your mother

12:29.693 --> 12:32.958
that a tuckered-out
old man needs a room.

12:37.868 --> 12:38.926
Good afternoon, sir.

12:39.003 --> 12:40.834
Afternoon.

12:40.905 --> 12:45.604
Doc Hostetler says you
might be able to help me.

12:45.676 --> 12:47.109
How kind of him.

12:47.178 --> 12:49.408
Yes, sir, I have
one room available.

12:49.480 --> 12:50.708
Good.

12:55.386 --> 12:56.819
Downstairs
in the rear.

12:56.887 --> 12:58.286
$8.00 by the week.

12:58.355 --> 13:00.755
$2.00 per day if
you're not permanent.

13:00.825 --> 13:02.759
Well, I'm not
permanent, ma'am.

13:02.827 --> 13:06.263
Oh, boy, get my gear and
the saddlebags off that horse

13:06.330 --> 13:08.696
and bring them
into the house.

13:10.234 --> 13:13.897
Gillom will be happy
to do that.

13:24.181 --> 13:26.615
The parlor
is yours to use

13:26.684 --> 13:28.117
and the telephone.

13:28.185 --> 13:30.278
My other lodgers
have rooms upstairs.

13:30.354 --> 13:32.618
Two railroad men
and a schoolteacher.

13:32.690 --> 13:35.784
I'll introduce them
at supper.

13:35.860 --> 13:37.452
My kitchen.

13:40.030 --> 13:41.793
And the bathroom.

13:41.866 --> 13:44.300
I thought
that's what it was.

13:44.368 --> 13:46.802
We do have
running water,

13:46.871 --> 13:49.806
also in the washbowl
in here.

13:51.108 --> 13:52.473
Nice-looking brass bed.

13:52.543 --> 13:54.977
I hope it hasn't
got any, uh...

13:55.045 --> 13:56.808
It isn't ticky, is it?

13:56.881 --> 13:59.816
It certainly is not.

13:59.884 --> 14:01.249
This is very comfortable.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.582
I'll take my meals
right here.

14:03.654 --> 14:05.747
I serve
in the dining room.

14:05.823 --> 14:07.381
I'll pay you extra.

14:07.458 --> 14:10.894
Very well, since
you're not permanent.

14:10.961 --> 14:14.397
This suit's got a lot
of countryside on it.

14:14.465 --> 14:17.229
I'd like to have it
brushed before morning.

14:18.502 --> 14:21.767
I'll take
those saddlebags.

14:21.839 --> 14:24.273
That bedroll you can
leave outside.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.775
I have my things
wrapped in it.

14:26.844 --> 14:28.778
They'll need
soap and water.

14:28.846 --> 14:30.279
Have you a barn?

14:30.347 --> 14:31.780
No, we don't.

14:31.849 --> 14:33.942
Boy, take my horse over...

14:34.018 --> 14:36.384
My name's Gillom.
It's not "boy. "

14:36.453 --> 14:37.886
It's Gillom Rogers,

14:37.955 --> 14:41.049
and I don't like
being ordered around.

14:44.261 --> 14:47.788
Well, that's fair enough,
Gillom Rogers.

14:47.865 --> 14:51.631
Would you be so kind
as to take Old Dollar

14:51.702 --> 14:53.294
over to
the livery stable

14:53.370 --> 14:56.806
and see that he gets
a double order of oats?

14:58.709 --> 14:59.801
O.K.

15:05.950 --> 15:07.918
You seem to be a man

15:07.985 --> 15:09.748
accustomed
to giving orders.

15:09.820 --> 15:12.220
I guess it is
a bad habit of mine.

15:12.289 --> 15:14.086
I didn't
get your name.

15:14.158 --> 15:16.251
I didn't give it.

15:16.327 --> 15:17.988
Is it so important?

15:18.062 --> 15:20.997
For anyone living under
my roof, it is.

15:21.065 --> 15:22.498
Well, all right.

15:22.566 --> 15:25.763
It's, uh... Hickok,

15:25.836 --> 15:27.770
William Hickok.

15:27.838 --> 15:30.773
Where do you hail from,
Mr. Hickok?

15:30.841 --> 15:32.274
Abilene, Kansas.

15:32.343 --> 15:34.777
And what
do you do there?

15:34.845 --> 15:37.109
I'm a U.S. Marshal.

15:37.181 --> 15:38.614
Oh, that's nice.

15:38.682 --> 15:40.274
No, it isn't.

15:40.351 --> 15:43.286
I'm glad you're not
staying long, Mr. Hickok.

15:43.354 --> 15:45.618
I'm not sure
I like you.

15:45.689 --> 15:47.657
Not many do,
Mrs. Rogers.

16:00.371 --> 16:04.239
Moses, where did you hide
the whiskey this time?

16:04.308 --> 16:06.902
Third drawer from
the left, Gilly boy.

16:20.824 --> 16:23.156
Gilly, fetch me
my spectacles.

16:38.842 --> 16:40.776
What the hell
are you doing?

16:40.844 --> 16:42.869
You watch
your language, boy.

17:00.497 --> 17:05.366
J.B. Books is
in my house.

17:05.435 --> 17:06.903
Hey.

17:06.970 --> 17:09.768
My name is Books.

17:09.839 --> 17:11.272
Y'all get that?

17:12.343 --> 17:20.548
Bang!

17:20.617 --> 17:21.878
Boom!

17:21.952 --> 17:24.146
He's in my house.

17:29.159 --> 17:31.354
Ma!

17:31.428 --> 17:33.760
Ma, I got to
tell you something.

17:33.831 --> 17:35.264
Shh. Close the door.

17:35.332 --> 17:36.424
What's happened?

17:38.502 --> 17:39.935
Who do you think...

17:40.003 --> 17:42.437
Oh, Gillom, you've
been drinking again.

17:42.506 --> 17:44.770
Do you know
who he is?

17:44.842 --> 17:46.002
William Hickok...

17:46.076 --> 17:49.307
United States Marshal
in Abilene, Kansas.

17:49.380 --> 17:51.280
Ma,
Wild Bill Hickok

17:51.348 --> 17:54.283
was shot
before I was born.

17:55.719 --> 17:58.381
We got
J.B. Books here.

17:58.455 --> 18:00.582
He's killed 30 men.

18:02.459 --> 18:04.256
Gillom, go to your room.

18:04.328 --> 18:07.729
Go on. Go to bed before
you wake the house.

18:07.798 --> 18:09.231
Good night, Ma.

18:10.801 --> 18:12.063
Whoo.

18:18.709 --> 18:19.971
Come in.

18:21.645 --> 18:22.737
Mr. Books?

18:22.813 --> 18:24.246
Oh, my clothes.

18:24.314 --> 18:26.805
Thank you, m...

18:26.884 --> 18:29.444
You are J.B. Books.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.886
That's right.

18:33.824 --> 18:36.588
May I ask
how you found out?

18:36.660 --> 18:37.592
My son.

18:37.661 --> 18:39.595
I've been up all night
because of you.

18:39.663 --> 18:42.257
I demand that you
pack and leave.

18:42.332 --> 18:44.766
That is not possible.

18:44.835 --> 18:46.325
And why not?

18:47.838 --> 18:50.466
I don't
propose to say.

18:50.541 --> 18:52.008
So you won't go.

18:52.075 --> 18:53.474
No.

18:53.544 --> 18:55.179
And that's
your last word?

18:55.312 --> 18:57.644
Mrs. Rogers,
you have a fine color

18:57.715 --> 19:00.707
when you're
on the scrap.

19:12.663 --> 19:16.099
Central, give me
the city marshal's office.

19:16.166 --> 19:18.191
Thank you.

19:30.014 --> 19:31.777
Come in, Marshal.

19:40.190 --> 19:41.919
My name's Thibido,

19:41.992 --> 19:43.619
Marshal
Walter Thibido.

19:43.694 --> 19:47.425
I'm told...
you are J.B. Books.

19:47.498 --> 19:48.965
You were told right.

19:49.033 --> 19:50.466
Have a seat.

19:50.534 --> 19:51.933
Don't think I will.

19:52.002 --> 19:54.436
Breathe easy, Marshal.

19:54.505 --> 19:57.440
You're closer to your gun
than I am to mine.

19:57.508 --> 20:00.636
Books, Carson City's
full of hard cases...

20:00.711 --> 20:02.474
Is your head cold?

20:02.546 --> 20:03.638
Huh?

20:03.714 --> 20:04.806
Oh.

20:04.882 --> 20:07.316
Books, Carson City's
full of hard cases

20:07.384 --> 20:10.319
who'd sell their souls to
put your name on the wall.

20:10.387 --> 20:13.788
You'll draw trouble like
an outhouse draws flies.

20:13.857 --> 20:16.155
I checked my bulletins
before I come over

20:16.226 --> 20:18.956
and didn't find nothing
I can hold you for,

20:19.029 --> 20:21.156
but I want you
out of town...

20:21.231 --> 20:22.664
directly, today.

20:22.733 --> 20:25.167
Maybe I'm not
so inclined.

20:25.235 --> 20:27.931
Then, by God,
I will incline you.

20:28.005 --> 20:30.997
I can badge
as many men as I need.

20:31.075 --> 20:34.010
We'll smoke you out or
carry you out feet first,

20:34.078 --> 20:36.672
so you say which,
Mr. Gunman.

20:36.747 --> 20:38.681
It's your funeral.

20:38.749 --> 20:39.943
Soon, yes.

20:40.017 --> 20:41.177
Huh?

20:41.251 --> 20:42.684
I can't go.

20:42.753 --> 20:43.947
Can't?

20:44.021 --> 20:47.218
I'm going to die
right here in this room.

20:48.759 --> 20:51.626
Ha! That's too thin.

20:51.695 --> 20:53.686
I wish you were right.

20:53.764 --> 20:56.198
Would you believe
Doc Hostetler?

20:56.266 --> 20:57.824
That's his verdict.

21:01.205 --> 21:02.638
You don't say?

21:02.706 --> 21:04.901
You don't sa...
goddamn!

21:04.975 --> 21:06.101
Whoo!

21:06.176 --> 21:08.007
Whooee!

21:08.078 --> 21:09.909
I tell you
the truth...

21:09.980 --> 21:13.143
Coming through that door,
I was scared.

21:13.217 --> 21:16.812
I know what a man
like you is capable of.

21:16.887 --> 21:19.151
I wondered
who'd get my job,

21:19.223 --> 21:22.158
if the council would give
my wife a pension,

21:22.226 --> 21:25.161
and if it would snow
the day they put me under.

21:25.229 --> 21:28.357
Excuse me if I don't
pull a long face.

21:28.432 --> 21:29.660
You talk too much.

21:29.733 --> 21:31.667
Much as I damn please.

21:31.735 --> 21:34.169
How long does
Hostetler give you?

21:34.238 --> 21:36.206
He doesn't know.
Do me a favor.

21:36.273 --> 21:38.503
I owe you one...
or Hostetler.

21:38.575 --> 21:41.669
My being here...
maybe that's news,

21:41.745 --> 21:44.179
but dying
is my own business.

21:44.248 --> 21:47.183
Keep it under your hat,
will you?

21:47.251 --> 21:50.448
Just don't take
too long to die.

21:50.521 --> 21:53.456
Be a gent and
convenience everybody

21:53.524 --> 21:55.424
and do it soon.

21:58.162 --> 22:00.027
You've worn out
your welcome.

22:00.097 --> 22:01.029
Scat.

22:06.203 --> 22:08.467
The day they
lay you away,

22:08.539 --> 22:10.803
what I'll do
on your grave

22:10.874 --> 22:12.307
won't pass
for flowers.

22:31.528 --> 22:32.961
You damn little sneak.

22:33.030 --> 22:35.260
How long
were you there?

22:35.332 --> 22:37.266
I was just
passing by.

22:37.334 --> 22:38.801
You spy on me,

22:38.869 --> 22:41.167
and I'll nail you
to a tree.

22:41.238 --> 22:42.671
You've told your mother.

22:42.740 --> 22:44.674
Who else have you
blabbed to?

22:44.742 --> 22:46.073
Jay Cobb.

22:46.143 --> 22:48.338
Are you all right,
Mr. Books?

22:48.412 --> 22:50.175
I can't abide
a skulker.

22:50.247 --> 22:52.772
You want to see me,

22:52.850 --> 22:55.785
knock on my door
like a man.

22:55.853 --> 22:57.184
Sure you're all right?

22:57.254 --> 22:58.551
If there's anything

22:58.622 --> 23:00.249
I can do for you,
just let me know.

23:00.324 --> 23:03.122
It's an honor to have you
in this house.

23:03.193 --> 23:04.626
Your mother
doesn't agree.

23:04.695 --> 23:07.755
She doesn't know
how a man feels.

23:07.831 --> 23:10.629
You're the most famous person
ever in this town.

23:10.701 --> 23:12.635
When I was a boy,

23:12.703 --> 23:15.638
I heard about your shootout
at the Acme Saloon.

23:15.706 --> 23:17.970
I never thought
I'd meet you.

23:18.041 --> 23:20.305
There's more
to being a man

23:20.377 --> 23:21.810
than handling a gun.

23:21.879 --> 23:24.541
Don't you have
something to do?

23:24.615 --> 23:28.551
I was just headed over to
Cobb's Creamery right now.

23:28.619 --> 23:31.053
I help Jay with
deliveries sometimes.

23:31.121 --> 23:33.055
That was
the nice gentleman

23:33.123 --> 23:34.556
you were with
yesterday.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.058
Where's your mother?

23:36.126 --> 23:38.560
She's in the kitchen,
I think.

23:38.629 --> 23:40.153
Well, goodbye, sir.

23:40.230 --> 23:42.664
It was real nice
meeting you.

23:42.733 --> 23:43.825
Good-bye.

24:02.152 --> 24:06.486
Mrs. Rogers, I, uh...
hope you'll forgive me

24:06.557 --> 24:09.117
for taking Hickok's name.

24:09.193 --> 24:12.629
I thought it was
pretty funny at the time,

24:12.696 --> 24:16.496
but after reflection...

24:16.567 --> 24:19.627
it wasn't such a joke,
and I apologize.

24:19.703 --> 24:20.795
You should.

24:20.871 --> 24:23.635
The only way you can
show your repentance

24:23.707 --> 24:25.140
is to leave.

24:25.209 --> 24:28.042
Well, that
I cannot do.

24:28.111 --> 24:31.547
Mr. Books, you are
a notorious individual

24:31.615 --> 24:34.049
utterly lacking
in character or decency.

24:34.117 --> 24:35.550
You're an assassin.

24:35.619 --> 24:38.554
That's according to which end
of the gun you're on.

24:38.622 --> 24:41.056
You lied to me,
made a fool of me.

24:41.124 --> 24:43.058
This house
is all I have.

24:43.126 --> 24:45.060
If my lodgers
find out who you are,

24:45.128 --> 24:46.152
they'll leave.

24:46.230 --> 24:47.663
I have a cancer.

24:50.734 --> 24:52.326
I'm dying of it.

24:56.740 --> 24:59.174
I know what
you'll be thinking...

24:59.243 --> 25:02.110
That I'll be
a lot of trouble.

25:02.179 --> 25:03.612
Well, I won't.

25:03.680 --> 25:06.114
You just
bring me my meals,

25:06.183 --> 25:09.118
and I'll see
to the other needs.

25:09.186 --> 25:12.087
I promise you
I won't be a burden.

25:15.926 --> 25:19.362
Mrs. Rogers, I'm
in a kind of a tight...

25:19.429 --> 25:21.624
I'll make it
worth your while.

25:21.698 --> 25:24.758
I can pay $4.00 a day
for the room.

26:01.171 --> 26:02.263
Oh, Mr. Books.

26:02.339 --> 26:05.103
Most pleased to meet you,
sir, and honored.

26:05.175 --> 26:08.110
What did you want
to see me about?

26:08.178 --> 26:09.611
The name is Dan Dobkins.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.614
<i>I'm with
The Morning Appeal.</i>

26:11.682 --> 26:13.115
Mr. Dobkins,
sit down.

26:13.183 --> 26:14.115
Thank you.

26:14.184 --> 26:15.116
Um...

26:15.185 --> 26:17.119
we ran the story
this morning

26:17.187 --> 26:19.621
that you were here
at Mrs. Rogers'

26:19.690 --> 26:21.624
and enjoying our
salubrious winter climate

26:21.692 --> 26:23.626
and so on and so forth.

26:23.694 --> 26:24.786
Have you seen it?

26:24.861 --> 26:26.660
No.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.021
It's page one,
I assure you.

26:28.095 --> 26:30.529
I bought your paper
when I arrived.

26:30.597 --> 26:32.929
Still reading about
Queen Victoria dying.

26:33.000 --> 26:33.932
Oh.

26:34.001 --> 26:36.435
What can I do for you?

26:36.503 --> 26:38.266
That's what
I came to discuss.

26:38.338 --> 26:39.896
Well, that's
what I figured.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.270
You must
appreciate, sir,

26:41.341 --> 26:44.310
that you are the most
celebrated shootist extant.

26:44.378 --> 26:45.868
Extant?

26:45.946 --> 26:48.039
Uh, still existing,

26:48.115 --> 26:49.173
alive.

26:49.249 --> 26:50.216
Thank you.

26:50.283 --> 26:52.547
Yes, and your reputation
is nationwide.

26:52.619 --> 26:55.554
My story went out over
the wires this morning.

26:55.622 --> 26:58.056
Every daily of consequence
will run it,

26:58.125 --> 26:59.217
but they'll want more,

26:59.292 --> 27:01.487
the papers in
the East, in particular.

27:01.561 --> 27:02.994
Between us, Mr. Books,

27:03.063 --> 27:07.124
we can really put
Carson City on the map.

27:07.200 --> 27:10.931
Mr. Dobkins, you're going
the long way around the barn.

27:11.004 --> 27:11.993
Yes, sir.

27:12.072 --> 27:13.505
I would
like tremendously

27:13.573 --> 27:15.632
to do a series
of stories on you.

27:15.709 --> 27:16.641
A series?

27:16.710 --> 27:19.736
Yes. Uh, how long
will you be with us?

27:19.813 --> 27:23.647
Not as long
as I'd like to be.

27:23.717 --> 27:26.652
Oh, well, we could
start today, right now,

27:26.720 --> 27:28.551
then get together
again tomorrow.

27:28.622 --> 27:29.714
You see,

27:29.790 --> 27:32.350
there's been so much
cheap fiction about gunmen.

27:32.426 --> 27:35.520
I want to get down to
the true story for once,

27:35.595 --> 27:37.062
while you're available,

27:37.130 --> 27:39.826
before anything
happens to you.

27:39.900 --> 27:41.925
I mean,
I hope nothing does.

27:42.002 --> 27:43.299
Go on.

27:43.370 --> 27:46.828
I want to cover
your career factually.

27:46.907 --> 27:48.932
The statistics,
you might say.

27:49.009 --> 27:51.534
Then I'd delve into the
psychological aspects...

27:51.611 --> 27:55.047
What turned you to violence
in the first place?

27:55.115 --> 27:58.084
Are you by nature
bloodthirsty?

27:58.151 --> 28:02.019
Uh, do you, uh, brood
after the deed is done,

28:02.089 --> 28:04.489
or have you lived
so long with death

28:04.558 --> 28:07.493
that you're used to it?
The death of others?

28:07.561 --> 28:09.495
The prospect
of your own?

28:09.563 --> 28:11.497
Make like
that's a nipple.

28:11.565 --> 28:12.998
One fit or fidget

28:13.066 --> 28:16.502
and Mrs. Rogers is going
to be scrubbing your brains

28:16.570 --> 28:18.003
off the wallpaper.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.504
On your feet.

28:19.573 --> 28:20.505
Back up.

28:20.574 --> 28:23.509
Now, we're heading
for the front door.

28:23.577 --> 28:26.512
Now, don't you shake,
shiver, or sneeze.

28:26.580 --> 28:29.515
Mr. Books, what in heaven's
name are you doing?

28:29.583 --> 28:32.017
Ma'am, we have
a touchy situation here.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.177
Out.

28:37.591 --> 28:38.523
Turn around.

28:38.592 --> 28:39.524
Mmm.

28:39.593 --> 28:40.525
Turn around.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.027
Bend over.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.187
Yes, sir.

28:43.263 --> 28:47.029
Dobkins, you are a prying,
pipsqueaking ass,

28:47.100 --> 28:51.400
and if you ever come
dandying around here again...

28:58.879 --> 29:01.370
That was
a savage thing to do.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.380
Maybe...

29:05.852 --> 29:06.841
Mr. Books?

29:08.321 --> 29:10.721
I'll tend myself.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.493
First things first, Doc.

29:16.563 --> 29:18.497
I almost forgot
to ask you.

29:18.565 --> 29:20.999
How much do I owe you?

29:21.067 --> 29:24.002
You're a man after
my own heart, Books.

29:24.070 --> 29:27.506
Most of them ask
that last, if at all.

29:27.574 --> 29:29.007
Well, let's see.

29:29.075 --> 29:32.010
We'll make it $4.00
for the two visits

29:32.078 --> 29:35.013
plus $ 1.00 for that.

29:35.081 --> 29:36.514
What's that?

29:36.583 --> 29:38.016
They call that laudanum,

29:38.084 --> 29:42.521
a solution of opium
and alcohol.

29:42.589 --> 29:45.888
Opium, that can
get to be a habit.

29:45.959 --> 29:48.553
Why, absolutely,
an addiction.

29:48.628 --> 29:51.119
How does it taste?

29:51.198 --> 29:53.598
Just... just awful,
terrible,

29:53.667 --> 29:57.626
but it's the most potent
painkiller we've got.

29:57.704 --> 30:00.605
How much of it
do I take?

30:00.674 --> 30:04.542
Well, as much as you need
when you need it.

30:04.611 --> 30:06.044
I think a spoonful

30:06.112 --> 30:08.546
would be all right
to start with.

30:08.615 --> 30:09.604
Later?

30:09.683 --> 30:10.877
I don't know,

30:10.951 --> 30:12.543
but I... I
think one morning

30:12.619 --> 30:15.554
you're just going
to wake up and say,

30:15.622 --> 30:20.559
"Here I am in this bed,
and here I'm going to stay. "

30:22.128 --> 30:24.426
Hostetler,
I want to know.

30:24.497 --> 30:26.556
Well, unless you insist,

30:26.633 --> 30:29.124
I'd rather not talk
about it.

30:30.637 --> 30:34.403
Well, I want to know.

30:34.474 --> 30:35.566
All right.

30:35.642 --> 30:37.075
There'll be an increase

30:37.143 --> 30:39.577
in the severity
of the pain

30:39.646 --> 30:44.174
in your lower spine,
your hips, your groin.

30:44.251 --> 30:45.582
You...

30:45.652 --> 30:49.315
Do you... Do you
want me to go on?

30:52.158 --> 30:54.592
The pain will
become unbearable.

30:54.661 --> 30:57.152
Uh, no drug
will moderate it.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.825
If you're lucky,
you'll lose consciousness,

31:00.900 --> 31:02.834
and until then,
you'll scream.

31:11.778 --> 31:13.541
L- I... I'm sorry.

31:13.613 --> 31:17.049
L... I didn't mean
to be specific like this.

31:17.117 --> 31:19.551
The next time,
I'll go to Mrs. Rogers.

31:19.619 --> 31:21.553
You... You...
You just telephone.

31:21.621 --> 31:23.384
You just telephone.

31:24.624 --> 31:28.856
There... There's
one more thing I'd say.

31:30.130 --> 31:34.567
Both of us have had
a lot to do with death.

31:34.634 --> 31:38.001
I'm not a brave man,
but you must be.

31:38.071 --> 31:39.060
Ah.

31:39.139 --> 31:42.074
Now-now-now,
this is not advice.

31:42.142 --> 31:44.076
It's not
even a suggestion.

31:44.144 --> 31:46.874
It's just something
for you to reflect on

31:46.946 --> 31:49.073
while your mind's
still clear.

31:49.149 --> 31:50.480
What?

31:50.550 --> 31:55.180
I would not die a death
like I just described.

31:55.255 --> 31:56.722
No?

31:56.790 --> 31:59.850
Not if I
had your courage.

31:59.926 --> 32:01.484
Oh.

32:05.098 --> 32:06.463
Thanks.

32:29.647 --> 32:31.774
Come in, Mrs. Rogers.

32:32.983 --> 32:34.075
Oh, Mr. Books, I...

32:34.151 --> 32:36.415
I'm beginning
to know your knock.

32:36.487 --> 32:38.614
I was reading
about old Queen Vic.

32:38.689 --> 32:42.455
Well, maybe she
outlived her time.

32:42.526 --> 32:44.960
Maybe she was
a museum piece,

32:45.029 --> 32:47.463
but she never
lost her dignity

32:47.531 --> 32:49.123
nor sold her guns.

32:49.200 --> 32:53.432
She hung on to her pride
and went out in style.

32:53.504 --> 32:56.905
That's the kind of
an old gal I'd like to meet.

32:56.974 --> 32:59.465
Mrs. Rogers,
are you afraid of me?

32:59.543 --> 33:02.376
Well, to be frank, yes.

33:02.446 --> 33:03.504
Why?

33:03.581 --> 33:07.347
All these guns and
the kind of man you are.

33:07.418 --> 33:10.353
Maybe you're afraid
of too many things.

33:10.421 --> 33:11.718
Sometimes widows are,

33:11.789 --> 33:15.486
but I'm sure there's plenty
of starch in your corset.

33:15.559 --> 33:19.825
Mr. Books, I came here
to see what you can eat,

33:19.897 --> 33:21.990
if you can have
what I'm serving.

33:22.066 --> 33:23.260
No, you didn't.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.802
I wish you'd stop
contradicting me.

33:25.870 --> 33:27.929
I wish you'd say
what you mean.

33:29.473 --> 33:31.737
Very well.

33:31.809 --> 33:34.607
I apologize for
the unchristian things

33:34.678 --> 33:36.305
I've said and done.

33:36.380 --> 33:40.316
I'm sorry, and I'll do
whatever I can for you.

33:41.485 --> 33:43.350
Well, thank you. I...

33:44.989 --> 33:47.924
All my life,
I've been too proud

33:47.992 --> 33:50.426
to take help
from anyone.

33:50.494 --> 33:52.485
Guess I'll
have to learn.

33:52.563 --> 33:54.588
Would you, uh...

33:54.665 --> 33:57.429
sit down for a moment?

33:57.501 --> 33:58.559
Please do.

34:03.941 --> 34:05.033
What's that?

34:05.109 --> 34:06.906
Laudanum.

34:09.947 --> 34:11.641
Doc Hostetler's remedy.

34:11.715 --> 34:13.376
That's habit-forming,
isn't it?

34:17.254 --> 34:19.882
Mrs. Rogers, would
you go for a drive

34:19.956 --> 34:22.391
in the country
with me tomorrow?

34:22.458 --> 34:24.824
Oh, I... I couldn't,
but thank you.

34:24.895 --> 34:26.226
I wish you'd reconsider.

34:26.297 --> 34:29.094
It would only be
for an hour or two.

34:29.166 --> 34:31.396
No. I appreciate
the invitation, but no.

34:31.467 --> 34:34.402
Is it that you don't want
to be alone with me?

34:34.471 --> 34:36.405
It's not that,
I assure you.

34:36.473 --> 34:40.034
It's just that I've only
been a widow for a year.

34:40.110 --> 34:41.042
People would...

34:41.110 --> 34:42.135
People!

34:42.213 --> 34:44.545
If I have to work
on your sympathy, I will.

34:44.614 --> 34:47.413
I want to go out
in the world again

34:47.484 --> 34:50.418
and see trees, lakes,
hills, and the sky.

34:50.487 --> 34:52.920
And I don't fancy
seeing it alone.

34:52.989 --> 34:55.652
I've been full
of alone lately.

34:57.494 --> 34:58.586
I'm sorry.

34:58.662 --> 35:01.927
Besides, there's a threat
of snow in the air.

35:01.999 --> 35:04.866
Since I moved in here,

35:04.935 --> 35:07.369
we've been scratching
at each other

35:07.438 --> 35:09.372
and apologizing.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.273
Well, let's see
if we can't do better.

35:12.343 --> 35:16.712
Damn it. I wish to hell
you'd ride with me.

35:16.780 --> 35:19.874
I apologize
for my language.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.249
I'll go with you.

35:24.321 --> 35:26.050
Good.

35:26.123 --> 35:27.556
Tomorrow at 10:00?

35:29.193 --> 35:31.923
Will you get, please,
Mr. Gillom Rogers

35:31.996 --> 35:33.725
to trot down
to the stable

35:33.797 --> 35:37.893
and get us the best horse
and buggy they have?

35:37.968 --> 35:38.900
I will.

35:38.969 --> 35:41.563
I'm much obliged, ma'am.

36:01.925 --> 36:03.017
Good evening.

36:31.789 --> 36:33.723
Deuce is the dead card.

36:33.791 --> 36:35.224
8 is your winner,

36:35.292 --> 36:38.227
and the lovely queen,
the loser.

36:38.295 --> 36:39.626
Hellfire!

36:39.697 --> 36:41.892
That makes seven
turnovers in a row.

36:41.965 --> 36:44.399
Pulford,J.B. Books
over at Mrs. Rogers.

36:44.468 --> 36:45.730
That was
yesterday's news.

36:45.803 --> 36:47.828
But I just heard
he's dying.

36:48.939 --> 36:49.963
Dying?

36:50.040 --> 36:52.167
Friend of mine got it
from Marshal Thibido.

36:52.242 --> 36:55.143
Old Books is cashing in.

36:56.780 --> 36:58.213
That's hard news.

36:58.282 --> 37:00.910
That's a man
I could have taken.

37:00.984 --> 37:01.916
Ha!

37:01.985 --> 37:03.009
My ass.

37:03.087 --> 37:04.315
You have two ways

37:04.388 --> 37:07.050
of leaving this
establishment, my friend...

37:07.124 --> 37:08.557
Immediately or dead.

37:20.437 --> 37:21.927
Gentlemen, place your bets.

37:22.005 --> 37:24.200
Place your bets,
gentlemen.

37:29.179 --> 37:30.168
Look out!

37:58.475 --> 37:59.407
43...

37:59.476 --> 38:00.340
44...

38:00.411 --> 38:01.343
45...

38:01.412 --> 38:02.344
46...

38:02.413 --> 38:03.345
47... 48.

38:03.414 --> 38:04.847
Clean through
the heart!

38:04.915 --> 38:06.405
Hey, Pulford!

38:06.483 --> 38:08.678
Over 80 feet!

38:08.752 --> 38:10.413
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

38:17.928 --> 38:19.361
Oh, mighty handsome,
ma'am.

38:19.430 --> 38:21.864
Moses had to dust
this buggy off.

38:21.932 --> 38:24.867
He says he don't
rent it too often.

38:24.935 --> 38:26.868
Doesn't.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.427
Except just
for funerals.

38:29.506 --> 38:31.371
Well, thank you, Gillom.

38:31.442 --> 38:32.875
I appreciate this.

38:32.943 --> 38:35.844
I want that wood chopped
by the time we get back.

38:35.913 --> 38:38.381
Oh, Ma, I was
going to go on...

38:38.449 --> 38:39.381
Yes, ma'am.

38:39.450 --> 38:40.382
Hyah.

39:10.414 --> 39:12.848
That is beauty.

39:12.916 --> 39:15.350
It is a little chilly
up here.

39:15.419 --> 39:17.353
Would you like
the top raised?

39:17.421 --> 39:18.683
No, thank you.

39:26.221 --> 39:27.654
You all right?

39:27.722 --> 39:30.088
I will be in a minute.

39:31.226 --> 39:32.659
Can I help you?

39:32.727 --> 39:35.423
I've had plenty
of practice.

39:45.907 --> 39:48.341
Why don't you
get married again?

39:48.410 --> 39:49.843
What?

39:49.911 --> 39:51.845
I think you heard me.

39:51.913 --> 39:53.847
That's none
of your affair.

39:53.915 --> 39:56.850
I haven't time
to be polite, Mrs. Rogers.

39:56.918 --> 39:59.853
Well, for one thing,
I haven't been asked.

39:59.921 --> 40:02.355
For another,
I loved my husband

40:02.424 --> 40:04.016
and still do.

40:04.092 --> 40:05.616
How did he die?

40:05.694 --> 40:06.854
Stroke, they think.

40:06.928 --> 40:09.863
They found him slumped
at his desk.

40:09.931 --> 40:11.364
He was lucky.

40:11.433 --> 40:12.866
He was 41.

40:12.934 --> 40:15.368
Did he have time
to, uh...

40:15.437 --> 40:17.803
Did he leave you
any security?

40:17.873 --> 40:20.364
I have the property
and the house,

40:20.442 --> 40:22.569
which he built
with a bank loan,

40:22.644 --> 40:23.633
and Gillom.

40:23.712 --> 40:25.373
And he worries you.

40:25.447 --> 40:26.880
Yeah, he certainly does,

40:26.948 --> 40:29.883
particularly when he
complains about being bored

40:29.951 --> 40:31.043
and needing excitement.

40:31.119 --> 40:33.883
Well, I wouldn't
be too hard on him.

40:33.955 --> 40:35.889
Every young man
feels the need

40:35.957 --> 40:38.551
to let the badger loose
now and again.

40:38.627 --> 40:40.891
I try to reason
with him. I can't.

40:40.962 --> 40:42.395
I can only
mother him.

40:42.464 --> 40:44.398
That's not
what he wants.

40:44.466 --> 40:46.900
<i>Like I said,
that you can change.</i>

40:46.968 --> 40:49.698
Don't you have enough
worries of your own?

40:49.771 --> 40:51.705
A few, but in general,

40:51.773 --> 40:55.106
I've had a hell
of a good time.

40:56.978 --> 40:58.411
Tell me, um...

40:58.480 --> 41:00.846
what does the J.B.
Stand for?

41:00.916 --> 41:01.848
John Bernard.

41:01.917 --> 41:03.851
And yours?

41:03.919 --> 41:04.943
Bond.

41:05.020 --> 41:08.615
That's a crackerjack
of a name for a woman.

41:08.690 --> 41:10.351
How do you do, Bond?

41:10.425 --> 41:12.859
How do you do,
John Bernard?

41:12.928 --> 41:13.952
Shall we?

41:14.029 --> 41:14.961
Hyah!

41:29.945 --> 41:32.379
Good morning,
Mrs. Rogers!

41:32.447 --> 41:33.880
Mr. Sweeney.

41:33.949 --> 41:36.110
Mike Sweeney?

41:36.184 --> 41:39.210
John Bernard Books,

41:39.287 --> 41:42.085
now, I'm flattered
that you remembered me.

41:42.157 --> 41:43.556
You live around here now?

41:43.625 --> 41:46.116
My spread's in
the foothills to the west.

41:46.194 --> 41:49.891
Well, you look just like
I remember the Sweeneys...

41:49.965 --> 41:51.728
mean and ugly.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.735
Well, I heard
that you were in town

41:54.803 --> 41:58.000
for a very short time.

41:58.073 --> 41:59.734
That's true.

41:59.808 --> 42:01.002
Drop by.

42:01.076 --> 42:03.010
We'll talk about old times.

42:03.078 --> 42:04.511
The good old times.

42:04.579 --> 42:06.171
Ha ha ha!

42:07.415 --> 42:10.009
You can bring
your fancy pillow,

42:10.085 --> 42:12.610
and your landlady
is welcome, too.

42:12.687 --> 42:13.745
Now, my problem is

42:13.822 --> 42:16.347
that she never
accepts my invitation,

42:16.424 --> 42:20.417
and to you two,
I say good-bye.

42:24.766 --> 42:27.701
I'm surprised
at the company you keep.

42:27.769 --> 42:30.704
That man is no friend.
Quite the reverse.

42:30.772 --> 42:32.364
How do you know him?

42:32.440 --> 42:34.874
I don't.
I had some dealings

42:34.943 --> 42:36.877
with his
brother Albert once.

42:36.945 --> 42:37.877
What happened?

42:38.947 --> 42:39.914
Oh.

42:39.981 --> 42:42.381
That's what worries me,
John Bernard...

42:42.450 --> 42:44.714
the thought
of your victims.

42:44.786 --> 42:47.687
What worried me
was survival.

42:47.756 --> 42:50.884
Bond, I don't believe
I ever killed a man

42:50.959 --> 42:52.392
that didn't deserve it.

42:52.460 --> 42:55.452
Surely, only the Lord
can judge that.

44:22.417 --> 44:23.349
Mr. Books!

44:24.586 --> 44:25.712
Mr. Books?

44:42.937 --> 44:44.370
Sir?

44:44.439 --> 44:45.804
Are you hurt?

44:45.874 --> 44:47.068
No.

44:48.343 --> 44:49.776
But they are.

44:50.945 --> 44:52.776
Call the marshal.

44:58.219 --> 44:59.709
He got both of them.

44:59.788 --> 45:02.313
They came in through
the windows... guns blazing.

45:02.390 --> 45:03.482
Close your robe.

45:03.558 --> 45:06.322
He's so damn fast,
he killed them both.

45:06.394 --> 45:09.329
John Bernard Books
in a shootout right here.

45:09.397 --> 45:10.830
Son of a bitch!

45:10.899 --> 45:13.834
I will not have that
language in my house.

45:13.902 --> 45:16.496
Sorry, but this
is a great day.

45:16.571 --> 45:18.698
Our house is
a part of history.

45:18.773 --> 45:20.138
You've got
to know that.

45:20.208 --> 45:22.039
That's nothing
to be proud of.

45:22.110 --> 45:23.839
I love that old man.

45:23.912 --> 45:25.277
Gillom! All right!

45:25.346 --> 45:27.337
It's time you knew.

45:27.415 --> 45:28.507
He's dying.

45:31.419 --> 45:32.681
Who?

45:32.754 --> 45:33.846
Mr. Books.

45:35.924 --> 45:37.391
I don't believe it.

45:39.260 --> 45:40.693
He has a cancer.

45:42.263 --> 45:43.355
You're lying.

45:43.431 --> 45:45.456
He would have told me.

45:45.533 --> 45:46.966
But he didn't tell you!

45:47.035 --> 45:48.400
He told me.

45:50.572 --> 45:52.301
He's dying.

46:01.883 --> 46:02.907
Ma.

46:07.388 --> 46:08.446
Ma.

46:13.210 --> 46:14.541
You do understand?

46:14.612 --> 46:16.546
That's the last of it.

46:16.614 --> 46:18.707
Thank you,
Mr. Hutchins.

46:18.783 --> 46:20.717
My position
as a teacher,

46:20.785 --> 46:22.218
as a maiden lady,

46:22.286 --> 46:25.221
I'm obliged to move
to another place.

46:25.289 --> 46:26.722
Of course.
I apologize.

46:26.791 --> 46:28.224
We're ready to go!

46:29.293 --> 46:30.260
Bye.

46:47.812 --> 46:48.744
Some coffee?

46:48.813 --> 46:50.747
Don't mind if I do.

46:50.815 --> 46:52.749
Did you know those two?

46:52.817 --> 46:53.749
Nope.

46:53.818 --> 46:55.251
They sure knew you.

46:55.319 --> 46:56.411
Who were they?

46:56.487 --> 46:58.751
Ben Shoup,
the one you killed

46:58.823 --> 47:00.188
trying to get out
the window.

47:00.257 --> 47:01.349
The other
named Norton...

47:01.425 --> 47:03.859
Two no-goods, not
from around here.

47:03.928 --> 47:05.691
I've never heard
of them.

47:05.763 --> 47:06.855
Quite a night.

47:06.931 --> 47:09.195
Your bedroom looks like
a slaughterhouse.

47:09.266 --> 47:10.358
Oh, Mrs. Rogers.

47:10.434 --> 47:12.664
I'll post a man
outside nights.

47:12.736 --> 47:15.170
That'll cost the taxpayers
$3.00 a night

47:15.239 --> 47:17.833
and $ 10 apiece to
plant two corpses.

47:17.908 --> 47:19.705
Death and taxes,
Books.

47:19.777 --> 47:21.711
Keeping you alive
to die natural

47:21.779 --> 47:23.679
is costing us
a pretty penny.

47:23.747 --> 47:26.215
There's no need
of any man outside.

47:26.283 --> 47:27.545
I'd appreciate that,
Marshal.

47:27.618 --> 47:28.550
Thank you.

47:29.787 --> 47:33.223
L... I can't tell you
how sorry I am

47:33.290 --> 47:35.224
about what happened
last night.

47:35.292 --> 47:36.725
That won't help.

47:36.794 --> 47:38.227
Two men are dead.

47:39.797 --> 47:42.027
I was defending myself.

47:47.805 --> 47:49.238
How are you feeling,

47:49.306 --> 47:51.240
a little more poorly
every day?

47:51.308 --> 47:54.243
You've got a streak of
kindness a mile wide.

47:54.311 --> 47:56.245
That I do.
Tell you what...

47:56.313 --> 47:59.248
Maybe I can help
speed things along.

47:59.316 --> 48:03.184
Did you read about the shooting
the night before last?

48:03.254 --> 48:04.186
No.

48:04.255 --> 48:06.189
Whooee! That
was some shooting.

48:06.257 --> 48:08.191
Pulford, he's
the faro dealer,

48:08.259 --> 48:10.193
got off one round
under fire,

48:10.261 --> 48:11.694
straight
through the heart,

48:11.762 --> 48:13.195
and it measured 84'3".

48:13.264 --> 48:15.698
Maybe I'll just
send him here,

48:15.766 --> 48:18.701
let him deal you
a little faro.

48:18.769 --> 48:19.861
You do that,
Marshal.

48:19.937 --> 48:21.199
This is 19-aught-1.

48:21.272 --> 48:24.207
The old days are gone.
You don't know it.

48:24.275 --> 48:26.209
We've got waterworks,
telephones, lights.

48:26.277 --> 48:29.212
We'll have our streetcar
electrified by next year,

48:29.280 --> 48:31.714
and we've started
to pave the streets.

48:31.782 --> 48:34.216
We've still got
some weeding to do.

48:34.285 --> 48:37.220
Once we're rid
of people like you,

48:37.288 --> 48:39.722
we'll have a goddamn
Garden of Eden here.

48:39.790 --> 48:41.724
To put it in a nutshell,

48:41.792 --> 48:43.953
you've plain plumb
outlived your time.

48:44.028 --> 48:47.395
You couldn't put it in
a barrel without a bottom.

48:47.464 --> 48:50.228
You're the longest-winded
bastard I ever listened to.

48:50.301 --> 48:52.735
I may be windy,
but I ain't ornery.

48:52.803 --> 48:54.532
When my time comes
to die,

48:54.605 --> 48:57.403
I won't drag it out.
I'll just do it.

48:57.474 --> 48:58.566
Why don't you?

48:58.642 --> 48:59.609
Thibido...

49:02.746 --> 49:04.577
I don't scare anymore.

49:04.648 --> 49:06.673
Neither did Shoup
or Norton.

49:06.750 --> 49:10.117
You wouldn't gun down
a police officer.

49:10.187 --> 49:13.987
What'd stop me,
fear of dying?

49:56.533 --> 49:58.467
#John Bernard Books #

49:58.535 --> 50:01.470
# Lies amolderin'
in his grave #

50:01.538 --> 50:03.472
#John Bernard Books #

50:03.540 --> 50:06.236
# Lies amolderin'
in his grave #

50:06.310 --> 50:08.175
#John Bernard Books #

50:08.245 --> 50:10.645
# Lies amolderin'
in his grave #

50:10.714 --> 50:12.511
# But his horse keeps #

50:12.583 --> 50:14.710
# Gallopin' on ##

50:14.785 --> 50:16.252
Moses?

50:16.320 --> 50:18.311
Would you care
to do business

50:18.389 --> 50:20.289
with a voice
from the grave?

50:20.357 --> 50:21.881
Mr. Books!

50:21.959 --> 50:23.790
It's pure pleasure
to groom your horse!

50:23.861 --> 50:25.795
And even
a greater pleasure

50:25.863 --> 50:27.296
to do business
with you!

50:27.364 --> 50:29.229
Would you kindly
step into my office?

50:29.299 --> 50:31.494
Lt'll be a pleasure.

50:31.568 --> 50:33.035
Right this way, please.

50:35.906 --> 50:37.066
Yes, sir.

50:38.442 --> 50:39.875
Now, let me see

50:39.943 --> 50:41.877
where I put
my spectacles

50:41.945 --> 50:45.244
because I wouldn't
want to make no, uh...

50:45.315 --> 50:46.942
financial mistake.

50:48.986 --> 50:50.476
Yes, sir.

50:51.755 --> 50:53.689
Here they are, Mr. Books.

50:53.757 --> 50:55.691
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

50:55.759 --> 50:57.454
$ 100.

50:57.528 --> 50:59.962
That's a lot
of money, Moses.

51:00.030 --> 51:02.965
Who do I have...
What's this for?

51:03.033 --> 51:05.365
What's it for?
For your horse.

51:05.436 --> 51:07.870
My horse? I want
to sell my horse,

51:07.938 --> 51:09.872
but this wouldn't
buy my saddle.

51:09.940 --> 51:12.374
But, Mr. Books,
you done agreed.

51:12.443 --> 51:13.467
When?

51:13.544 --> 51:14.977
When you sent Gilly...

51:15.045 --> 51:17.479
I mean, when Mr. Rogers
said this morning

51:17.548 --> 51:19.982
$ 100 would be
just fine with you.

51:20.050 --> 51:22.484
I'll have to have a talk
with Mr. Rogers.

51:22.553 --> 51:24.885
As far as
the horse goes, it's 3.

51:24.955 --> 51:26.820
300?

51:26.890 --> 51:28.380
300.

51:28.459 --> 51:32.190
I might maybe
can go 200.

51:32.262 --> 51:34.696
You might maybe
go more than that

51:34.765 --> 51:37.199
'cause you'll get more than
that 'cause it's mine.

51:37.267 --> 51:38.461
3.

51:38.535 --> 51:40.298
250.

51:40.370 --> 51:43.362
3, and I'll throw
the saddle in for cash.

51:43.440 --> 51:44.873
What about my bill?

51:44.942 --> 51:46.807
You throw that in.

51:46.877 --> 51:48.845
I ain't made of money.

51:48.912 --> 51:52.177
Are we going to stand
here and haggle all day?

51:54.985 --> 51:59.854
Mr. Books, you the most
famous man I ever seen

51:59.923 --> 52:01.356
and the second-best
haggler.

52:01.425 --> 52:02.892
Who's the best?

52:02.960 --> 52:04.587
Here I stand.

52:04.661 --> 52:06.424
Well, let's get
to haggling.

52:06.497 --> 52:09.091
Let's get to haggling.
All right.

52:09.166 --> 52:12.033
Let's get to haggling.

52:12.102 --> 52:14.093
1, 2, 3, 4.

52:14.171 --> 52:16.833
That's 200. 200.

52:19.309 --> 52:21.038
200 there.

52:21.111 --> 52:27.243
20, 40, 60,
80, 90, 295.

52:27.317 --> 52:28.409
No.

52:31.088 --> 52:32.521
296?

52:32.589 --> 52:33.783
No.

52:33.857 --> 52:36.257
97?

52:37.761 --> 52:39.285
98?

52:39.363 --> 52:40.387
Sold.

52:40.464 --> 52:43.092
You mean I did it?

52:43.167 --> 52:47.035
Mr. Books, that makes me
the best haggler!

52:47.104 --> 52:49.538
The best
in the world, Moses.

52:49.606 --> 52:50.846
Yes, sir.

52:52.581 --> 52:53.513
Gillom!

52:57.452 --> 52:58.510
Gillom!

52:59.955 --> 53:00.887
Where's Gillom?

53:00.956 --> 53:02.389
In the woodshed.

53:02.457 --> 53:04.220
That's appropriate.

53:04.293 --> 53:05.624
Why?

53:05.694 --> 53:07.628
You stay out of this.

53:15.904 --> 53:16.962
Gillom!

53:17.039 --> 53:18.472
I'm in here.

53:18.540 --> 53:21.373
You'll account to me.

53:21.443 --> 53:22.375
Sir?

53:24.980 --> 53:27.414
You were trying
to cheat me,

53:27.482 --> 53:30.349
and Moses was trying
to cheat you.

53:31.920 --> 53:32.852
I'm sorry.

53:32.921 --> 53:35.856
I'm glad of that,
but it doesn't...

53:37.759 --> 53:40.193
it doesn't tell me
very much.

53:42.998 --> 53:44.090
She, uh...

53:46.268 --> 53:49.203
She cried on my shoulder
this morning

53:49.271 --> 53:50.704
on account of you.

53:52.874 --> 53:54.808
I had to comfort her.

53:56.411 --> 53:58.845
And then the lodgers
moved out.

53:58.914 --> 54:00.848
Your room is a mess...

54:00.916 --> 54:04.443
and now Ma's worried
about losing the house.

54:05.954 --> 54:07.888
Well, I just thought
that...

54:07.956 --> 54:10.390
that maybe you might
want to do something

54:10.459 --> 54:12.893
to try and make it up
to her.

54:12.961 --> 54:14.895
I thought you might
be interested

54:14.963 --> 54:17.397
in selling your horse
since you're...

54:17.466 --> 54:19.195
Since I'm what?

54:22.237 --> 54:24.068
You're dying.

54:26.475 --> 54:29.035
How did you
find that out?

54:29.111 --> 54:31.705
Ma told me.

54:33.315 --> 54:37.376
Guess I'm the last one
in town to know about it.

54:37.452 --> 54:39.886
Don't you think you
should have talked to me

54:39.955 --> 54:42.389
before you tried
to sell my horse?

54:42.457 --> 54:44.254
Yes, sir.

54:44.326 --> 54:45.793
I suppose.

54:45.861 --> 54:48.796
But I just wanted
to see first

54:48.864 --> 54:51.799
if Moses would buy it,
that's all.

54:51.867 --> 54:53.835
I'm not a horse thief.

55:01.710 --> 55:04.076
A man's emotions can...

55:04.146 --> 55:07.172
tangle him all up
sometimes.

55:07.249 --> 55:11.743
I've been operating on
the raw edge lately, Gillom.

55:11.820 --> 55:16.723
Guess I just jumped
too far too fast.

55:16.792 --> 55:22.424
But, son, I never thought
you were a horse thief.

55:22.497 --> 55:24.931
And I hope I can
hang around long enough

55:25.000 --> 55:26.968
to make it up to you.

55:29.838 --> 55:30.770
Sir...

55:30.839 --> 55:32.739
do you think...

55:32.808 --> 55:36.471
Would you give me
a shooting lesson?

55:36.545 --> 55:37.978
A shooting lesson?

55:38.046 --> 55:42.107
Well, a man should know
how to handle a gun,

55:42.184 --> 55:44.311
use it with discretion.

55:44.386 --> 55:45.978
But, uh...

55:46.054 --> 55:48.614
you going to tell
your mother?

55:49.825 --> 55:51.793
Well... do I have to?

55:51.860 --> 55:55.296
Come on, I'll get us
something to shoot with.

56:03.605 --> 56:04.697
It's beautiful.

56:06.742 --> 56:10.178
See that tree
on the left

56:10.245 --> 56:11.678
with the divided trunk?

56:11.747 --> 56:13.180
You take the right side.

56:13.248 --> 56:15.682
Aim well and put
five slugs in it.

56:15.751 --> 56:17.184
Why not six?

56:17.252 --> 56:20.119
You keep your hammer on
an empty chamber for safety.

56:20.188 --> 56:23.123
And if you're going out
to face somebody?

56:23.191 --> 56:26.126
Load six if your insides
tells you to.

56:26.194 --> 56:27.855
Now, take your time.

56:46.415 --> 56:48.349
That's good shooting,
Gillom.

57:13.208 --> 57:14.675
Hey, Mr. Books,

57:14.743 --> 57:16.938
my spread's not much
bigger than yours.

57:17.012 --> 57:19.173
You did well.

57:19.247 --> 57:20.373
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

57:20.449 --> 57:23.612
Jay Cobb lets me practice
with him by the lake...

57:23.685 --> 57:25.619
when he's not in jail.

57:25.687 --> 57:29.282
Day before yesterday, he
smashed some salesman's jaw.

57:29.357 --> 57:31.416
Nice employer
you have.

57:31.493 --> 57:33.825
Well, it's just
temporary...

57:33.895 --> 57:37.126
till I find
whatever's right for me.

57:37.199 --> 57:38.131
Yeah.

57:38.200 --> 57:39.633
Wouldn't I like to see

57:39.701 --> 57:42.135
him and Jack Pulford
go at it.

57:42.204 --> 57:44.638
Did you hear about
what Pulford did?

57:44.706 --> 57:45.638
I did.

57:45.707 --> 57:46.833
Mr. Books.

57:46.908 --> 57:48.000
Yeah?

57:48.076 --> 57:50.510
How did you ever kill
so many men?

57:50.579 --> 57:54.515
I lived most of my life
in the wild country,

57:54.583 --> 57:58.019
and you set a code
of laws to live by.

57:58.086 --> 57:59.348
What laws?

57:59.421 --> 58:02.356
I won't be wronged,
I won't be insulted,

58:02.424 --> 58:04.858
I won't be laid
a hand on.

58:04.926 --> 58:07.360
I don't do these things
to other people,

58:07.429 --> 58:10.125
and I require
the same from them.

58:10.198 --> 58:12.632
But how could you get
into so many fights

58:12.701 --> 58:14.635
and always come out
on top?

58:14.703 --> 58:16.136
I nearly tied you
shooting.

58:16.204 --> 58:19.605
There's nobody up there
shooting back at you.

58:19.674 --> 58:21.608
It isn't always
being fast

58:21.676 --> 58:23.610
or even accurate
that counts.

58:23.678 --> 58:25.407
It's being willing.

58:25.480 --> 58:28.745
I found out early
that most men,

58:28.817 --> 58:30.682
regardless of cause
or need,

58:30.752 --> 58:31.684
aren't willing.

58:31.753 --> 58:34.688
They blink an eye
or draw a breath

58:34.756 --> 58:36.690
before they pull
the trigger.

58:36.758 --> 58:37.986
I won't.

58:38.059 --> 58:39.526
Bat Masterson told Cobb...

58:39.594 --> 58:41.255
Bat Masterson?

58:41.329 --> 58:42.591
Yeah.

58:42.664 --> 58:45.599
He says that a man
has to have, uh...

58:45.667 --> 58:50.161
guts, deliberation, and
a proficiency with firearms.

58:50.238 --> 58:52.934
Did he mention that
third eye you better have?

58:53.008 --> 58:54.305
Third eye?

58:54.376 --> 58:56.537
For that dumb-ass
amateur.

58:56.611 --> 58:59.102
It's usually some
six-fingered bustard

58:59.180 --> 59:01.580
that couldn't hit
a cow in the tit

59:01.650 --> 59:02.844
with a tin cup

59:02.918 --> 59:05.011
that does you in.

59:05.086 --> 59:06.519
But then,
Bat Masterson

59:06.588 --> 59:09.022
always was
full of sheep dip.

59:09.090 --> 59:12.150
Whoa. I hope you're
smart enough to know

59:12.227 --> 59:15.594
that that who hit John
don't go with guns.

59:15.664 --> 59:18.861
Oh, sure. Yes, sir.

59:18.934 --> 59:21.869
Well, now that we got
that cleared up...

59:21.937 --> 59:24.064
as my Mexican friend
said,

59:24.139 --> 59:26.334
"To the pure life. "

59:41.285 --> 59:42.217
Johnny?

59:43.754 --> 59:44.686
Yes?

59:44.755 --> 59:46.848
May I come in?

59:55.566 --> 59:58.467
Don't... Don't you
remember me?

59:58.535 --> 01:00:01.129
Serepta?

01:00:03.173 --> 01:00:04.606
Oh.

01:00:04.675 --> 01:00:09.908
Sera, I can't tell you
how happy I am you're here.

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.414
I came
the minute I heard.

01:00:22.726 --> 01:00:24.853
Have I changed
so much?

01:00:26.497 --> 01:00:29.989
No, it's... just been
a long time.

01:00:32.903 --> 01:00:34.962
It isn't true,
is it?

01:00:35.038 --> 01:00:37.006
God, how I loved you.

01:00:37.074 --> 01:00:39.565
And I loved you.

01:00:41.011 --> 01:00:42.535
Is it true?

01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:46.782
Oh, no.

01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:48.818
Aw, don't cry, Sera.

01:00:48.886 --> 01:00:51.218
We all have our time.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.494
I must look a sight.

01:01:00.564 --> 01:01:02.293
For sore eyes.

01:01:08.238 --> 01:01:09.865
You still with Pardee?

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:13.967
No. He treated me
the way I did you.

01:01:14.044 --> 01:01:15.978
He just
up and skipped.

01:01:18.949 --> 01:01:20.382
We should have married.

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:22.577
Spilt milk.

01:01:23.754 --> 01:01:25.187
You never did, huh?

01:01:25.255 --> 01:01:26.847
No.

01:01:26.924 --> 01:01:30.655
Now you're alone.
I'm so glad I'm here.

01:01:30.727 --> 01:01:32.160
So am I.

01:01:35.832 --> 01:01:37.697
Would you still
like to?

01:01:39.903 --> 01:01:44.237
We could get a minister
and just say I do.

01:01:44.308 --> 01:01:46.742
That way, I'd have
the certificate.

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:49.244
I'd have something
to go on.

01:01:49.313 --> 01:01:50.245
Not much.

01:01:50.314 --> 01:01:51.747
I'd have your name.

01:01:51.815 --> 01:01:54.249
How far would that
take you?

01:01:54.318 --> 01:01:56.786
Long ways, maybe.

01:01:58.188 --> 01:01:59.280
How?

01:02:01.158 --> 01:02:04.218
Johnny, you're too
modest, you know?

01:02:04.294 --> 01:02:06.854
Everybody knows
who you are.

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:09.364
I'd be
Mrs. J.B. Books.

01:02:09.433 --> 01:02:10.957
I'd be somebody.

01:02:11.034 --> 01:02:13.764
That wouldn't buy you
any bacon.

01:02:15.105 --> 01:02:17.596
Well, it might.

01:02:17.674 --> 01:02:21.110
See, that's how come
I knew that you had...

01:02:23.347 --> 01:02:25.781
that-that you was
ailing bad.

01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:28.943
This newspaper reporter
here tracked me down.

01:02:29.019 --> 01:02:31.453
He wants to put out
a book on you.

01:02:31.521 --> 01:02:34.684
He'll write it
and use my name.

01:02:34.758 --> 01:02:36.123
<i>The Shootist...</i>

01:02:36.193 --> 01:02:38.525
<i>The Life and Bloody
Times ofJ.B. Books</i>

01:02:38.595 --> 01:02:41.359
by Serepta Books,
his wife.

01:02:41.431 --> 01:02:42.864
He said
in the East

01:02:42.933 --> 01:02:44.867
that it would sell
like hot cakes

01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:47.529
and he'd split it
with me.

01:02:47.604 --> 01:02:49.799
And his name is Dobkins.

01:02:49.873 --> 01:02:51.534
Right. How did you know?

01:02:51.608 --> 01:02:55.305
I kicked him out of here
for the same reason.

01:02:56.947 --> 01:02:58.881
Johnny,
what harm is there

01:02:58.949 --> 01:03:01.611
in a marriage certificate,
a piece of paper?

01:03:01.685 --> 01:03:04.210
I don't object to that.
It's the book.

01:03:04.287 --> 01:03:05.481
Why?

01:03:05.555 --> 01:03:06.954
What does he know
about my life?

01:03:07.024 --> 01:03:08.651
What do you know?

01:03:08.725 --> 01:03:13.162
He says what he doesn't
know, he'll make up,

01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:15.198
and, you know,
gory things,

01:03:15.265 --> 01:03:17.290
shoot-'em-ups
and midnight rides

01:03:17.367 --> 01:03:19.301
and women tearing
out their hair.

01:03:19.369 --> 01:03:21.997
It will be a corker,
I promise you.

01:03:22.072 --> 01:03:24.233
<i>Woman, I still have
some pride.</i>

01:03:25.809 --> 01:03:29.336
A man should be allowed
his human dignity.

01:03:36.953 --> 01:03:39.888
I spent $3.00
on the train here.

01:03:39.956 --> 01:03:41.446
One-way.

01:03:45.295 --> 01:03:50.232
You and Dobkins are two sides
of a counterfeit coin.

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.427
I'll pay you back.

01:03:52.502 --> 01:03:54.936
I'll pay you both ways.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.974
What's wrong
about a book?

01:03:59.042 --> 01:04:02.478
I'll not be remembered
for a pack of lies.

01:04:02.546 --> 01:04:06.243
'Cause you're too damn
mule mean, that's why.

01:04:06.316 --> 01:04:08.011
You always was.

01:04:08.085 --> 01:04:11.020
Why should you care what's
happening? You're dying.

01:04:11.088 --> 01:04:13.022
I have
to go on living,

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:16.025
and you don't give a hoot
in hell what happens!

01:04:16.093 --> 01:04:19.028
Why should you?
You won't be here!

01:04:19.096 --> 01:04:21.394
God. And I loved you once.

01:04:22.799 --> 01:04:24.926
You bastard.

01:04:25.001 --> 01:04:27.799
May you rot to death!

01:04:46.456 --> 01:04:49.254
# 'Twas blighted
affection #

01:04:49.326 --> 01:04:51.817
# That made him exclaim #

01:04:51.895 --> 01:04:54.523
# Oh, willow
tit-willow #

01:04:54.598 --> 01:04:57.328
# Tit-willow #

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.595
# And if you remain
callous #

01:04:59.669 --> 01:05:02.297
# And obdurate, I #

01:05:02.372 --> 01:05:04.567
# Shall perish
as he did #

01:05:04.641 --> 01:05:08.338
# And you will
know why #

01:05:08.411 --> 01:05:12.404
# Though I probably
shall not exclaim #

01:05:12.482 --> 01:05:14.609
# As I die #

01:05:14.684 --> 01:05:16.174
# Oh, willow #

01:05:16.253 --> 01:05:17.880
# Tit-willow #

01:05:17.954 --> 01:05:20.422
# Tit-willow
says I ##

01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:22.424
You seem
in fine fettle today.

01:05:22.492 --> 01:05:25.427
I should be.
I'm full of laudanum.

01:05:25.495 --> 01:05:26.928
I'll get
your breakfast.

01:05:26.997 --> 01:05:28.430
Good. Thank you.

01:05:28.498 --> 01:05:31.797
I didn't mean
to break up the recital.

01:05:31.868 --> 01:05:33.301
Oh, that's all right.

01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:34.803
It was just something

01:05:34.871 --> 01:05:36.304
for the Sunday School
class

01:05:36.373 --> 01:05:37.738
for the church social.

01:05:37.808 --> 01:05:41.505
Bond, uh, I've driven off
all your other lodgers.

01:05:41.578 --> 01:05:45.207
Is it all right if I
have breakfast out here?

01:05:45.282 --> 01:05:46.715
Of course it is.

01:05:48.819 --> 01:05:53.347
I was delighted to see you
had a lady caller yesterday.

01:05:53.423 --> 01:05:56.358
She asked me
not to announce her.

01:05:56.426 --> 01:06:00.226
She said she wanted
to surprise you.

01:06:00.297 --> 01:06:02.026
Were you surprised?

01:06:02.098 --> 01:06:04.191
That I was.

01:06:04.267 --> 01:06:06.064
Oh, these clothes,
uh...

01:06:06.136 --> 01:06:08.627
they're my
Sunday-go-to-meetings.

01:06:08.705 --> 01:06:11.139
I wish you'd give them
a good brushing.

01:06:11.208 --> 01:06:12.140
Certainly.

01:06:13.743 --> 01:06:16.303
They're getting
pretty roady.

01:06:16.379 --> 01:06:19.314
Nine days on the back
of a saddle

01:06:19.382 --> 01:06:20.815
in a bedroll.

01:06:20.884 --> 01:06:23.182
Wouldn't you rather
have them cleaned?

01:06:23.253 --> 01:06:25.187
That's the general idea.

01:06:25.255 --> 01:06:27.189
I mean there's
a new method

01:06:27.257 --> 01:06:28.690
called dry-process
cleaning.

01:06:28.758 --> 01:06:30.191
It's very good.

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:31.693
How long does it take?

01:06:31.761 --> 01:06:33.194
They advertise
next-day service,

01:06:33.263 --> 01:06:34.696
but tomorrow's
Sunday.

01:06:34.764 --> 01:06:37.130
I'm afraid I'll have
to settle for the brushing

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.634
'cause I'll need them
first thing Monday morning.

01:06:39.703 --> 01:06:42.137
I'll ask. If I can't
get them by then,

01:06:42.205 --> 01:06:43.638
I'll brush them.

01:06:43.707 --> 01:06:46.141
I'll get
your ham and eggs.

01:06:46.209 --> 01:06:48.370
Just biscuits will do.

01:06:48.445 --> 01:06:50.845
My stomach's
kind of feeble today.

01:06:50.914 --> 01:06:53.678
Oh. You sure

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.615
you won't want these
for church tomorrow?

01:06:55.685 --> 01:06:58.848
I don't think so.

01:06:58.922 --> 01:07:02.240
You're most welcome to
accompany Gillom and me.

01:07:02.307 --> 01:07:04.241
Maybe your church
won't welcome me.

01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:06.573
That's a terrible thing
to say.

01:07:06.645 --> 01:07:09.580
Doors of the church
are open to everyone.

01:07:09.648 --> 01:07:12.981
Well, my church has been
the mountains and solitude.

01:07:13.051 --> 01:07:14.484
No doors at all.

01:07:14.553 --> 01:07:17.954
That's hardly
the same thing.

01:07:18.023 --> 01:07:20.457
We all need a minister
to guide us.

01:07:20.525 --> 01:07:22.823
Well, if you think of it,

01:07:22.894 --> 01:07:25.328
give a thought
to my soul tomorrow.

01:07:25.397 --> 01:07:27.831
I will. I have been
praying for you.

01:07:27.899 --> 01:07:29.833
I think Gillom has, too.

01:07:29.901 --> 01:07:31.960
Thank you.
Thank you both.

01:07:33.238 --> 01:07:34.671
Tell me, um...

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:38.107
what did he do yesterday
that made you so angry?

01:07:38.176 --> 01:07:40.007
It isn't what he did.

01:07:40.078 --> 01:07:41.841
It's what he didn't do.

01:07:41.913 --> 01:07:43.346
We have that
straightened out.

01:07:43.415 --> 01:07:45.849
You should be proud
of Gillom.

01:07:45.917 --> 01:07:48.351
He has the making
of something special.

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:49.853
I hope so.

01:07:49.921 --> 01:07:52.082
I'm going to send
Reverend Saunders

01:07:52.157 --> 01:07:53.124
to see you tomorrow.

01:07:53.191 --> 01:07:55.182
No, thank you.

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:57.694
Maybe it'll make it
easier for you.

01:07:57.763 --> 01:07:58.695
No.

01:07:58.764 --> 01:08:00.857
Just for a few minutes.

01:08:00.932 --> 01:08:03.366
Bond, I'm tired of people
pawing over my death

01:08:03.435 --> 01:08:06.302
for this reason or that
or for any reason.

01:08:06.371 --> 01:08:08.965
A man's death is about
the most private thing

01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:10.474
in his life.

01:08:10.542 --> 01:08:13.136
It doesn't belong to Dobkins
or Reverend Saunders

01:08:13.211 --> 01:08:14.644
or Thibido or you.

01:08:14.713 --> 01:08:15.805
It's mine.

01:08:15.881 --> 01:08:18.349
I suppose that's true
of your soul, too.

01:08:18.417 --> 01:08:20.850
My soul is what
I've already made of it.

01:08:20.919 --> 01:08:23.854
You reprimand me
for making judgments

01:08:23.921 --> 01:08:26.356
with a gun barrel
poked in my face,

01:08:26.425 --> 01:08:29.883
but it's all right for you
to judge me on hearsay.

01:08:29.961 --> 01:08:31.154
But the hearsay fits.

01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:33.662
Maybe I'm better than
you've already decided.

01:08:33.732 --> 01:08:37.667
Maybe I'm no worse
than that good reverend.

01:08:37.736 --> 01:08:39.670
Maybe you like
being a gunman.

01:08:39.738 --> 01:08:41.706
You probably prefer
the word shootist.

01:08:41.773 --> 01:08:44.435
I don't think
of myself as either.

01:08:44.509 --> 01:08:46.443
Oh, no. You're some
godlike creature

01:08:46.511 --> 01:08:48.103
of infinite knowledge,
aren't you?

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:51.308
I'm a dying man
scared of the dark.

01:08:52.684 --> 01:08:56.120
Damn you! Damn you for
the pain you've brought

01:08:56.188 --> 01:08:57.746
into this house.

01:10:08.493 --> 01:10:09.926
There we are, sir.

01:10:16.468 --> 01:10:17.628
Mr. Books.

01:10:17.702 --> 01:10:18.964
Yes, sir?

01:10:19.037 --> 01:10:21.471
I'm Hezekiah Beckum,
the undertaker, sir.

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:22.973
How do you do?

01:10:23.041 --> 01:10:26.010
I hope you don't think
my stopping by

01:10:26.077 --> 01:10:27.510
is untimely, sir.

01:10:27.579 --> 01:10:31.606
No, I admire a man
with get-up-and-go.

01:10:31.683 --> 01:10:34.618
As the saying goes
in our profession,

01:10:34.686 --> 01:10:37.655
the early worm
gets the bird.

01:10:39.057 --> 01:10:42.993
I, uh, admit to having heard
some unfortunate things.

01:10:43.061 --> 01:10:45.996
I'd like to express
my heartfelt regret.

01:10:46.064 --> 01:10:48.123
All right.
What's your proposition?

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.634
I'm prepared to offer
you embalming

01:10:50.702 --> 01:10:53.466
by the most, uh,
scientific methods,

01:10:53.538 --> 01:10:56.735
a bronze coffin guaranteed
good for a century

01:10:56.808 --> 01:10:58.241
regardless
of the climatic

01:10:58.310 --> 01:11:00.244
or geological
conditions,

01:11:00.312 --> 01:11:01.745
my best hearse,

01:11:01.813 --> 01:11:04.247
uh, the minister
of your choice,

01:11:04.316 --> 01:11:08.047
and the presence of at
least, uh, two mourners...

01:11:08.119 --> 01:11:11.418
a headstone of the finest
Carrera marble...

01:11:11.489 --> 01:11:13.923
and a plot in size
and location

01:11:13.992 --> 01:11:15.550
befitting
your status, sir...

01:11:15.627 --> 01:11:18.061
and perpetual care
of the grounds.

01:11:18.129 --> 01:11:20.029
For how much?

01:11:20.098 --> 01:11:22.828
Why, nothing, sir.
For the privilege.

01:11:22.901 --> 01:11:26.701
No, I mean how much will
you make on the deal?

01:11:26.771 --> 01:11:29.205
Oh, Beckum,
you're going to do to me

01:11:29.274 --> 01:11:31.708
what they did
to John Wesley Hardin.

01:11:31.776 --> 01:11:33.710
You're going
to lay me out,

01:11:33.778 --> 01:11:37.145
let the public gawp at me
for 50 cents a head,

01:11:37.215 --> 01:11:39.149
10 cents
for the children.

01:11:39.217 --> 01:11:40.650
When the curiosity
peters out,

01:11:40.719 --> 01:11:42.584
you'll stick me
in a hole

01:11:42.654 --> 01:11:45.088
while you hurry to
the bank with your loot.

01:11:45.156 --> 01:11:46.885
I assure you...

01:11:46.958 --> 01:11:49.392
Give me a scrap
of paper and a pencil.

01:11:49.461 --> 01:11:51.452
What good's
your assurance

01:11:51.529 --> 01:11:54.794
when my veins are filled
with your damn juice?

01:11:54.866 --> 01:11:57.801
No. Here's what
you're going to do.

01:11:59.204 --> 01:12:02.139
First you're going
to give me $50 cash.

01:12:02.207 --> 01:12:03.640
Then early
Monday morning,

01:12:03.708 --> 01:12:05.972
you'll bring me
a headstone.

01:12:06.044 --> 01:12:09.480
I want a small headstone
with this written on it.

01:12:09.547 --> 01:12:10.878
Nothing else.

01:12:10.949 --> 01:12:13.383
No jabbery, no angels.
You got that?

01:12:13.451 --> 01:12:16.318
Mr. Books,
you're a hard man.

01:12:16.388 --> 01:12:17.912
I'm alive.

01:12:17.989 --> 01:12:20.423
Ah, very well.

01:12:20.492 --> 01:12:22.426
I'll set
my stonecutter

01:12:22.494 --> 01:12:24.928
to work on the inscription
immediately.

01:12:24.996 --> 01:12:27.055
Mr. Beckum.

01:12:27.132 --> 01:12:29.157
The $50.

01:12:29.234 --> 01:12:30.758
Oh. Hmm.

01:12:38.043 --> 01:12:40.068
Thank you, sir.

01:12:47.852 --> 01:12:49.843
Early worm,
early worm.

01:12:49.921 --> 01:12:53.357
That Beckum is just
what you say he is.

01:12:53.425 --> 01:12:57.327
Well... now,
how much do I owe you?

01:12:57.395 --> 01:12:59.329
Not one bitty penny,
Mr. Books.

01:12:59.397 --> 01:13:01.831
Why, to watch that
performance you done give,

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.835
I'd have paid $ 10
in a theater.

01:13:04.903 --> 01:13:08.168
Well, I may just accept
your generosity.

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:14.544
Besides, I may
just see if Beckum

01:13:14.612 --> 01:13:17.046
would like to buy some
of J.B. Books' hair.

01:13:17.115 --> 01:13:18.639
With
your permission.

01:13:18.717 --> 01:13:19.649
Permission granted.

01:13:19.718 --> 01:13:22.652
Good day, sir.

01:13:39.304 --> 01:13:40.737
What the hell?

01:13:46.077 --> 01:13:49.171
And the third man's
name is...

01:13:51.316 --> 01:13:53.750
Mike Sweeney.
Do you know him?

01:13:53.818 --> 01:13:56.753
Sure, I do. He's got one of
those horseless carriages.

01:13:56.821 --> 01:13:59.756
And now for the favor
I'm going to ask you.

01:13:59.824 --> 01:14:02.258
You just tell me, sir.
Anything at all.

01:14:02.327 --> 01:14:05.763
Don't dive in till
you know how deep it is.

01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:07.764
Today's the 27th,
isn't it?

01:14:07.832 --> 01:14:09.265
Yes, sir.

01:14:09.334 --> 01:14:14.431
Now, that's Jack Pulford,
Jay Cobb, and Mike Sweeney.

01:14:14.506 --> 01:14:16.770
Tomorrow morning early,

01:14:16.841 --> 01:14:19.776
I want you to go to each one
of them and tell them

01:14:19.844 --> 01:14:20.833
that I'll be at the
Metropole

01:14:20.912 --> 01:14:23.779
at 11 A.M.
On Monday the 29th,

01:14:23.848 --> 01:14:28.285
and don't tell any of them
that you've told the others.

01:14:28.353 --> 01:14:30.287
Cobb's still in jail.

01:14:30.355 --> 01:14:32.289
Yeah, well,
tell him anyway.

01:14:32.357 --> 01:14:35.292
Think you can
do that for me?

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.225
Well, I know I can,

01:14:37.295 --> 01:14:40.230
but, uh, Ma's going
to have conniptions

01:14:40.298 --> 01:14:43.734
if I don't go to
church in the morning.

01:14:43.802 --> 01:14:45.497
You can go
to church first.

01:14:45.570 --> 01:14:46.935
I telephoned Moses.

01:14:47.005 --> 01:14:50.406
You can ride Old Dollar
out to the Sweeney spread.

01:14:50.475 --> 01:14:51.601
Yes, sir.

01:14:51.676 --> 01:14:54.577
Thank you and...

01:14:54.646 --> 01:14:56.671
and good night.

01:14:59.818 --> 01:15:01.547
Son of a bitch.

01:15:05.323 --> 01:15:06.722
Don't cuss.

01:15:09.828 --> 01:15:11.295
Yes, sir.

01:15:26.436 --> 01:15:29.769
You know that kind of
music gets on my nerves,

01:15:29.839 --> 01:15:30.863
especially on Sunday.

01:15:30.941 --> 01:15:32.374
Sorry.

01:15:32.442 --> 01:15:34.876
Ma, are you angry
at Mr. Books?

01:15:34.945 --> 01:15:36.378
Why? What did he say?

01:15:36.446 --> 01:15:37.811
Nothing. It's just...

01:15:38.882 --> 01:15:40.315
Ma, I'm sorry.

01:15:40.383 --> 01:15:43.318
I got to go run some
errands for Mr. Books.

01:15:43.386 --> 01:15:44.819
I promised him.

01:15:44.888 --> 01:15:45.912
Gillom.

01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:48.322
Gillom.

01:15:48.391 --> 01:15:51.121
I'll be back soon.
Soon as I can.

01:16:01.104 --> 01:16:03.334
Oh! Oh!

01:16:03.406 --> 01:16:05.840
What happened?
Are you all right?

01:16:05.909 --> 01:16:07.342
I slipped in the tub.

01:16:07.410 --> 01:16:08.843
Let me help you.

01:16:08.912 --> 01:16:09.879
Hell.

01:16:09.946 --> 01:16:12.847
Come on, now.
Hang on to me. That's it.

01:16:12.916 --> 01:16:15.350
Now sit on the edge
of the tub.

01:16:15.418 --> 01:16:16.851
I'll get you another towel.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:17.852
Damn!

01:16:17.921 --> 01:16:19.855
John Bernard,
you swear too much.

01:16:19.923 --> 01:16:21.356
The hell I do.

01:16:21.424 --> 01:16:22.857
Put your arm
around my shoulder.

01:16:22.926 --> 01:16:25.520
Why didn't you
ask me to help you

01:16:25.595 --> 01:16:26.857
in the first place?

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:27.862
I couldn't.

01:16:27.931 --> 01:16:28.863
Why not?

01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:30.866
I promised you
I wouldn't be a burden.

01:16:30.934 --> 01:16:33.869
But you are, so let's
just forget about that.

01:16:33.937 --> 01:16:35.871
I sure as hell am.

01:16:35.939 --> 01:16:37.804
Oh, let me sit down.

01:16:37.874 --> 01:16:42.311
Oh, sit down for a minute
while I catch my breath.

01:16:42.379 --> 01:16:43.539
Oh...

01:16:44.881 --> 01:16:49.284
well, we finally made it
through a full day

01:16:49.352 --> 01:16:50.785
without having a fight.

01:16:50.854 --> 01:16:53.789
Well, we haven't seen
each other all day.

01:16:53.857 --> 01:16:55.290
You're right there.

01:16:55.358 --> 01:16:57.349
You know, Bond,

01:16:57.427 --> 01:16:59.827
you're such a real
lady on the outside.

01:16:59.896 --> 01:17:03.332
You're full of vim and
vinegar on the inside.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.335
I just never met
anybody like you.

01:17:06.403 --> 01:17:07.836
You're running low.

01:17:07.904 --> 01:17:11.340
I better call Dr. Hostetler
and order some more.

01:17:11.408 --> 01:17:12.841
No. This'll do.

01:17:12.909 --> 01:17:14.035
Oh.

01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:16.840
<i>That Morning Appeal.</i>

01:17:19.382 --> 01:17:21.509
I've skimmed newspapers
all my life.

01:17:21.584 --> 01:17:24.018
Never got the whole
good out of one.

01:17:24.087 --> 01:17:27.454
I bought this
the day I arrived,

01:17:27.524 --> 01:17:28.855
and I said to myself,

01:17:28.925 --> 01:17:32.861
"I'm going to read every
word, and when I'm done,

01:17:32.929 --> 01:17:36.558
"I'll know for a fact
exactly what happened

01:17:36.633 --> 01:17:39.796
on January 22nd
in the year 1901."

01:17:39.869 --> 01:17:42.804
It was an important day
in my life,

01:17:42.872 --> 01:17:44.305
and now I know.

01:17:45.375 --> 01:17:48.310
Would you do me a favor

01:17:48.378 --> 01:17:51.870
and give this honorable
incineration in my stove?

01:17:55.218 --> 01:17:58.153
You're getting ready
to do something.

01:17:58.221 --> 01:18:00.155
What makes you say that?

01:18:02.892 --> 01:18:03.824
This...

01:18:04.894 --> 01:18:06.020
dry cleaning...

01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:09.223
laudanum...

01:18:09.299 --> 01:18:10.288
haircut.

01:18:10.366 --> 01:18:13.529
I want you
to promise me something.

01:18:13.603 --> 01:18:18.802
Tomorrow when you see me in all
my dry-cleaning splendor

01:18:18.875 --> 01:18:21.469
and my Sunday-go-to-meeting
clothes,

01:18:21.544 --> 01:18:24.604
I want you to promise
there'll be no questions...

01:18:26.416 --> 01:18:29.908
no surmises,
no woman's intuition.

01:18:29.986 --> 01:18:34.218
All curiosity stops
right here and now.

01:18:34.290 --> 01:18:35.518
Promise me?

01:18:39.863 --> 01:18:42.195
And no tears, Bond.

01:18:42.265 --> 01:18:45.029
Mr. Books!

01:18:45.101 --> 01:18:47.433
In here, Gillom.

01:18:47.504 --> 01:18:50.302
Oh, so I see.

01:18:50.373 --> 01:18:51.806
No, you don't see.

01:18:51.875 --> 01:18:54.275
I was helping Mr. Books
out of the bathtub.

01:18:54.344 --> 01:18:55.276
What?

01:18:55.345 --> 01:18:57.905
You must be hungry.

01:18:57.981 --> 01:19:00.040
No, Ma. I'm fine.

01:19:07.123 --> 01:19:08.317
I promise.

01:19:09.392 --> 01:19:11.383
Thank you.

01:19:25.909 --> 01:19:28.343
Well, sir,
I got it done.

01:19:28.411 --> 01:19:30.845
Good. How'd you get
along with Old Dollar?

01:19:30.914 --> 01:19:32.347
Oh, he's a great horse.

01:19:32.415 --> 01:19:34.849
You should've seen the look
on Marshal Thibido's face

01:19:34.918 --> 01:19:37.352
when I rode up
to the jail.

01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:40.856
He must've thought I was you
coming to bust Cobb out.

01:19:40.924 --> 01:19:41.856
Hardly me.

01:19:41.925 --> 01:19:43.859
Which is just about
what I did do

01:19:43.927 --> 01:19:45.656
'cause Thibido's
going to let Cobb out

01:19:45.728 --> 01:19:47.923
long enough to meet you.

01:19:47.997 --> 01:19:48.929
Good.

01:19:48.998 --> 01:19:51.967
You'll never guess
how Cobb took that.

01:19:52.035 --> 01:19:53.764
I bet he jumped with joy.

01:19:53.837 --> 01:19:58.240
He got all white,
scared to death.

01:19:58.308 --> 01:19:59.240
Oh?

01:20:00.944 --> 01:20:02.377
Now, Pulford was happy.

01:20:02.445 --> 01:20:04.845
He really respects you.
He told me so.

01:20:04.914 --> 01:20:08.145
And he sure was polite.
He said, uh,

01:20:08.218 --> 01:20:11.381
"I eagerly await the
honor... and the privilege

01:20:11.454 --> 01:20:15.015
of having him try his
luck at my faro table. "

01:20:15.091 --> 01:20:18.026
We'll have
to give it a try.

01:20:18.094 --> 01:20:22.758
Now, how about
the other fella... Sweeney?

01:20:24.467 --> 01:20:27.402
You watch out
for him, Mr. Books.

01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:30.405
That man is mean,
and he hates you.

01:20:30.473 --> 01:20:33.909
Well, we'll see if we can't
clear that up tomorrow.

01:20:33.977 --> 01:20:35.911
Sir, what's...

01:20:35.979 --> 01:20:38.846
Thank you. We both
ought to get some sleep.

01:20:38.915 --> 01:20:40.576
Can I ask you something?

01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:43.050
I'm tuckered out.
We'll talk tomorrow.

01:20:43.119 --> 01:20:46.555
But I have to be out
before sunup,

01:20:46.623 --> 01:20:49.217
do the milk deliveries
while Cobb's in jail.

01:20:49.292 --> 01:20:51.783
Then we'll both
have a busy morning.

01:20:55.431 --> 01:20:57.865
Before you go...

01:20:57.934 --> 01:21:00.869
there's something
I want to give you.

01:21:00.937 --> 01:21:03.929
No, sir. No.
I won't take pay.

01:21:04.007 --> 01:21:05.872
And I wouldn't offer it,
Gillom.

01:21:05.942 --> 01:21:08.433
But you like Old Dollar,
don't you?

01:21:08.511 --> 01:21:10.945
Best horse I ever rode.

01:21:11.014 --> 01:21:13.949
Well, he's yours.
I bought him back.

01:21:14.017 --> 01:21:15.348
Here's the bill of sale.

01:21:15.418 --> 01:21:17.579
Now let me get
some sleep.

01:21:26.329 --> 01:21:27.421
Sir?

01:21:27.497 --> 01:21:28.521
Yeah?

01:21:29.599 --> 01:21:32.261
When you asked me
to do this,

01:21:32.335 --> 01:21:34.200
I- I didn't realize...

01:21:35.471 --> 01:21:37.735
and... and I just hope
that nothing...

01:21:37.807 --> 01:21:40.708
Just take good care
of Old Dollar.

01:21:46.249 --> 01:21:47.739
Good night, sir.

01:22:17.947 --> 01:22:18.879
Come in.

01:22:19.949 --> 01:22:22.383
We got the headstone.
Mr. Beckum...

01:22:22.452 --> 01:22:25.387
Good. Just put it there
on the bed.

01:22:25.455 --> 01:22:28.891
Beckum said as how he done
the best he could,

01:22:28.958 --> 01:22:30.892
but there weren't
much time.

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.894
Yeah, well,
that'll be all right.

01:22:32.962 --> 01:22:34.395
Well, I'll be goldarned,

01:22:34.464 --> 01:22:37.331
if they ain't gone
and left the date off.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.833
That'll be all right.

01:22:38.901 --> 01:22:39.833
Yes, sir.

01:22:39.902 --> 01:22:40.834
Thank you.

01:23:17.940 --> 01:23:19.874
Early for you,
ain't it?

01:23:19.942 --> 01:23:22.274
Yeah, well,
I'm expecting somebody.

01:23:24.907 --> 01:23:28.172
Bring me a cup of coffee,
will you, Murray?

01:23:28.244 --> 01:23:29.176
Sure.

01:24:46.822 --> 01:24:48.187
John Bernard?

01:24:49.292 --> 01:24:50.281
Oh.

01:24:54.330 --> 01:24:56.389
How grand you look.

01:24:56.465 --> 01:24:58.763
Thank you, Bond.

01:24:58.834 --> 01:25:02.770
That dry-process cleaning
is very good, isn't it?

01:25:02.838 --> 01:25:05.272
Yeah, but it's kind
of smelly.

01:25:05.341 --> 01:25:06.774
Well, that's the naphtha.

01:25:06.842 --> 01:25:08.639
Oh, this is my birthday.

01:25:08.711 --> 01:25:13.614
I, uh, haven't been to
a saloon for a long time,

01:25:13.683 --> 01:25:16.481
and I thought I'd get
a drink and celebrate.

01:25:16.552 --> 01:25:18.816
Happy birthday.

01:25:18.888 --> 01:25:21.049
Thank you.

01:25:23.359 --> 01:25:26.590
You have
a beautiful day for it.

01:25:26.662 --> 01:25:28.755
It's what we call
false spring.

01:25:36.539 --> 01:25:38.905
Good-bye, Mrs. Rogers.

01:25:40.309 --> 01:25:42.300
Good-bye, Mr. Books.

01:26:09.338 --> 01:26:11.602
Well, boy,
here's your big chance.

01:26:11.674 --> 01:26:13.266
Fame and fortune awaits.

01:26:13.342 --> 01:26:16.800
After I put that old man
out of his misery,

01:26:16.879 --> 01:26:18.471
I'm going to get you.

01:26:18.547 --> 01:26:19.980
Sure, you will.

01:26:21.917 --> 01:26:23.475
Don't wet your pants.

01:26:24.854 --> 01:26:28.790
Marshal Thibido!
May I see you for a moment?

01:26:34.630 --> 01:26:36.063
What's going on?

01:26:36.132 --> 01:26:38.066
Shh! Dobkins,
this is law business,

01:26:38.134 --> 01:26:40.227
not newspaper business.

01:26:40.303 --> 01:26:43.739
<i>Adolph S. Ochs is the publisher
of the New York Times.</i>

01:26:43.806 --> 01:26:45.740
He's asked me
for an article

01:26:45.808 --> 01:26:47.742
on how city officials
are reacting

01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:50.244
to the presence
of our famous shootist.

01:26:50.313 --> 01:26:54.249
I was thinking of doing
a series of stories on you.

01:26:54.317 --> 01:26:56.751
Whooee. Let's get
the hell off the street.

01:26:56.819 --> 01:26:59.913
You tell them that's
Thibido with an "H."

01:27:02.825 --> 01:27:04.087
Good morning.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.593
Good morning,
Mr. Books.

01:27:16.072 --> 01:27:20.270
You don't give a fella
very long to board this thing.

01:27:20.343 --> 01:27:23.005
Got a schedule to keep.

01:27:23.079 --> 01:27:25.445
Good morning.

01:27:25.514 --> 01:27:26.947
Good morning, sir.

01:27:27.016 --> 01:27:29.177
Isn't it
a beautiful day?

01:27:30.686 --> 01:27:32.278
It sure is.

01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:37.216
It's what we call
a false spring.

01:28:36.185 --> 01:28:37.152
Yes, sir?

01:28:42.591 --> 01:28:43.922
Glass.

01:28:45.494 --> 01:28:47.223
Mr. Sweeney...

01:28:47.296 --> 01:28:49.127
care to try your luck?

01:28:51.434 --> 01:28:52.366
Hmm.

01:29:24.266 --> 01:29:26.234
Hmm.

01:30:07.125 --> 01:30:09.184
Whoa!

01:30:10.762 --> 01:30:13.856
Friend... for you.

01:30:13.931 --> 01:30:15.125
What?

01:30:15.199 --> 01:30:17.997
Make you a little
more comfortable.

01:30:18.069 --> 01:30:22.028
Well, sir, these old bones
surely thank you.

01:30:25.309 --> 01:30:28.244
I sure hope the right
fella comes along.

01:31:03.281 --> 01:31:04.873
Good morning, sir.

01:31:04.949 --> 01:31:05.881
Good morning.

01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:08.350
This is my birthday.

01:31:08.419 --> 01:31:11.354
Give me the best
in the house.

01:31:11.422 --> 01:31:12.354
Yes, sir.

01:31:22.233 --> 01:31:23.723
Thank you, sir.

01:32:49.553 --> 01:32:53.512
And I'll tell you
that was for Albert!

01:34:46.804 --> 01:34:47.736
Look out!
