03:04.142 --> 03:06.602
Move, move it!
Come on, come on. Let's go!

03:18.781 --> 03:20.449
Jesus Christ!

03:29.876 --> 03:31.210
Loomis!

05:21.612 --> 05:27.242
I need you to come with me.
Just a minute.

05:27.410 --> 05:32.539
- Sophie thinks I have a mistress.
- Are you worried about that?

05:32.707 --> 05:38.378
If you lived with Sophie, you'd
understand. I miss our army days.

05:38.546 --> 05:43.633
We were happy then.
Well, I was happy, but you...

05:45.345 --> 05:47.888
Have you ever been happy?

05:48.056 --> 05:51.308
It's not Sophie that worries me.

05:53.102 --> 05:54.853
Then what?

06:04.447 --> 06:07.699
- Who is he?
- I thought he was you.

06:10.203 --> 06:14.456
We couldn't find you.
Then one of my men told me...

06:14.624 --> 06:20.128
...that you were at Major Lescourt's
funeral. I thought it was a joke.

06:24.425 --> 06:29.221
- But who is he?
- A good question.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.515
Come on.

06:31.682 --> 06:37.896
He was being chased, and there is
evidence he was recently tortured.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.483
His death was not an easy one.

06:43.277 --> 06:46.154
This was found in his pocket.

06:46.823 --> 06:51.243
Matches from the Hotel Chevre d'Or.
Our men are there now.

06:51.452 --> 06:57.040
- Let's go.
- Alain, I don't want you involved.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.002
I am involved.
Did you see his face?

07:03.297 --> 07:05.549
Are you coming or what?

07:20.440 --> 07:24.526
Monsieur Suverov, thank God!

07:24.694 --> 07:31.199
This man told me you were killed.
You only had your hair cut.

07:31.367 --> 07:35.537
- Suverov?
- Mikhail Suverov.

07:35.705 --> 07:41.126
If you want access to his room,
you can now ask M. Suverov.

07:41.294 --> 07:47.048
- May we search your room, sir?
- But of course.

07:48.718 --> 07:54.389
- Was the map I drew you correct?
- It was, thank you.

07:56.225 --> 08:02.314
- Did I get any messages?
- Yes, a telephone message.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.233
Alex Bohemia.

08:05.401 --> 08:08.737
- Did he leave a number?
- No, monsieur.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.530
Thank you.

08:13.576 --> 08:18.163
You heard that woman.
Suverov must've been looking for me.

08:22.251 --> 08:27.923
A stranger with your exact face
and exact birth date.

08:28.090 --> 08:34.554
He asks for directions to the street
where you live. A mystery, yes?

08:35.765 --> 08:39.601
An airline ticket
from Nice to New York.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.979
A New York driver's licence.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.441
U.S. cash.

08:55.159 --> 08:59.454
He was born five minutes after you.

08:59.622 --> 09:03.542
I kept both of you for three months.

09:03.709 --> 09:09.464
But I was sick.
I couldn't even nurse one of you.

09:11.592 --> 09:16.888
I needed the money.
I had to do it.

09:18.849 --> 09:25.313
- Why did you choose me?
- I didn't.

09:25.481 --> 09:29.484
I didn't have the courage.
Somebody else did it for me.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.819
Somebody else?

09:30.987 --> 09:37.993
A lawyer from Paris. He picked
your brother because you were crying.

09:38.452 --> 09:44.332
He saw that I needed money.
He said it was a good family.

09:46.210 --> 09:51.089
Oh, God. What have I done?

10:02.184 --> 10:06.396
You survived. Made a home for me.

10:10.026 --> 10:14.696
You did what you had to do.
I don't blame you.

10:17.992 --> 10:22.787
- You should've told me.
- I know.

10:23.456 --> 10:29.127
- What was the lawyer's name?
- Why?

10:29.629 --> 10:32.380
Somebody killed him, Mother.

10:32.548 --> 10:38.928
He was trying to come home
and they killed him.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.890
Alain, please...

10:45.269 --> 10:48.271
Can you remember his name?

10:48.439 --> 10:54.736
Etienne St. Denis. He had an office
in Place Pigalle in Paris.

10:55.863 --> 10:59.741
Express for Paris is now boarding
on platform two.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.747
Parents lie to their children...

11:05.915 --> 11:09.125
...to prepare them for the way they'll
be treated by the government.

11:09.293 --> 11:11.252
Maybe I'm wasting my time.

11:11.420 --> 11:15.799
If I don't go now, I'll regret it
for the rest of my life.

11:15.966 --> 11:21.012
You'll only open old wounds.
The lawyer can't bring him back.

11:21.222 --> 11:28.144
My brother was adopted. Through
his family I can get to know him.

11:50.292 --> 11:53.002
The lawyer is on the sixth floor.

11:53.504 --> 11:57.298
Remember, I'll do the talking.
And then seafood.

11:57.466 --> 12:00.760
I promise,
seafood before we go home.

12:50.102 --> 12:53.354
Get out! Go! Go!

12:55.191 --> 12:57.525
It was the man in the elevator.

12:58.819 --> 13:02.864
Help! Please, help!

13:27.389 --> 13:29.098
Help me!

13:51.455 --> 13:53.623
Don't hurt me.

13:54.625 --> 13:58.336
The adoption papers are here.
My boss made me hide them.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.255
He would not give them to anybody.

14:01.757 --> 14:05.510
Stay with me. You'll be safe.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.767
- No!
- Come on, let's go.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.488
Let's go.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.162
Come on.

16:22.064 --> 16:26.818
They've checked the entire floor.
There's no body.

16:27.903 --> 16:32.949
The secretary said a Russian guy
was questioning her boss.

16:33.117 --> 16:38.579
He locked her in her room.
Suddenly the place was on fire.

16:38.747 --> 16:43.751
- Have you gone through everything?
- We'Il keep looking.

16:44.920 --> 16:48.506
He was adopted by a Russian family.

16:48.674 --> 16:54.929
The father was a Soviet diplomat.
He emigrated to America in 1968.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.307
- When's the flight?
- What flight?

16:58.475 --> 17:02.812
Mikhail's flight to New York.
I want his passport.

17:02.980 --> 17:07.608
No, that's evidence. It was
no coincidence that guy was Russian.

17:07.776 --> 17:10.194
Who knows what Mikhail
was involved in.

17:10.570 --> 17:15.450
Sebastien, what happened to
my brother could've happened to me.

17:15.617 --> 17:20.329
32 years ago it was only luck
that kept me in France.

17:20.497 --> 17:27.127
He made a sacrifice
and never knew it. I've got to go.

17:28.130 --> 17:32.467
They don't know Mikhail is dead.
If you go to New York-

17:33.969 --> 17:36.137
Maybe he isn't.

17:49.651 --> 17:55.823
- A vodka nightcap, M. Suverov?
- No, thank you.

18:21.266 --> 18:25.853
- This is called gridlock.
- Next exit.

18:26.021 --> 18:30.900
I'm writing a novel on the job.
Literary kind of stuff.

18:32.528 --> 18:37.573
I see evertyhing. That's what
it's all about, observation.

18:37.741 --> 18:42.703
Take you, for instance,
that accent of yours.

18:42.871 --> 18:48.042
Is that European?
I bet you've got a story to tell.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.878
This is Davis Hartley here.
I'm not trying to rip you off.

18:55.926 --> 19:00.388
I'd have to be stupid
with a guy all bruised up like you.

19:00.556 --> 19:05.393
- You want to talk about it?
- No.

19:09.398 --> 19:15.319
I'm not trying to rip off your
experiences to put them in my novel.

19:15.487 --> 19:20.074
- I'm not some moral cretin.
- Not precisely.

19:20.242 --> 19:23.161
I'm trying to make a point here.

19:23.328 --> 19:30.084
I'm a professional cab driver.
That means I can find anything.

19:30.252 --> 19:33.713
I could find a penguin in a sandstorm.
I don't now what a penguin would be-

19:33.881 --> 19:40.219
Stop talking. Please, stop talking.
Hello! Stop talking. You want to help?

19:40.387 --> 19:42.930
After I stop, I'll be busy for a while.

19:43.849 --> 19:48.227
Find a guy named Alex Bohemia.

19:50.606 --> 19:57.111
How the hell am I supposed to find
an Alex Bohemia in New York City?

19:57.279 --> 20:01.282
Kind of like finding
a penguin in a sandstorm.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.003
Are you sure
you've got the right address?

20:27.309 --> 20:32.813
This ain't Atlantic City. Pick up
your milk money and get inside!

20:33.982 --> 20:37.360
I'm looking for...

20:38.654 --> 20:41.239
You're in the wrong neighbourhood!

20:42.324 --> 20:45.493
I'm looking for a family.
Maybe you can...

20:45.661 --> 20:50.498
Wack accent. You're way out
of your hood, white boy.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.375
You crazy or what?

20:53.043 --> 20:58.381
- Or are you a cop?
- Hey! Lay off, you little shits!

20:58.548 --> 21:00.925
Come on, old man. He's the chump.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.389
Thank you.

21:10.018 --> 21:14.105
They're not scared of you.
They don't know who you are.

21:14.314 --> 21:19.568
- Are they supposed to be scared?
- Everybody's scared of you.

21:19.736 --> 21:26.117
A big time gangster like you.
I thought you'd forgotten about us.

21:26.910 --> 21:29.912
I haven't seen you here
in a long time.

21:31.331 --> 21:33.040
I'm not who you think I am.

21:36.086 --> 21:41.424
When his family disappeared,
there was a lot of rumours.

21:42.551 --> 21:49.098
Some said they were back in Russia.
They had a store in Little Odessa.

21:49.266 --> 21:55.146
The Russian mob controls that place.
Maybe that's why he joined them.

21:57.399 --> 22:01.777
- How old was he?
-16. Forced to live on the street.

22:01.945 --> 22:05.323
This is a tough neighbourhood.

22:05.490 --> 22:10.244
- Did he ever mention me?
- No.

22:23.800 --> 22:28.471
Your brother's.
He kept it here all these years.

22:32.392 --> 22:33.934
Was he happy?

22:34.102 --> 22:40.608
Yeah, the last I saw of him.
He had matured. Real serious.

22:42.778 --> 22:47.865
- But he had choices.
- What choices? He was alone.

22:48.033 --> 22:52.703
I'd have taken him in.
He was a strange boy.

22:52.913 --> 22:57.792
Go back to France.
What you find here could be ugly.

23:01.129 --> 23:07.134
- Did he mention an Alex Bohemia?
- No.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.971
But there's a nightclub
in Little Odessa called the Bohemia.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.738
Your vodka, Mr. Suverov.

24:11.867 --> 24:16.537
- Excuse me-
- Mr. Suverov, you have a phone call.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.956
Follow me.

24:32.012 --> 24:34.221
Mikhail...

24:41.271 --> 24:45.399
Are you crazy? What are
you thinking, coming in here?

24:53.575 --> 24:58.245
The key wasn't in the mailbox
because I had to cover for Darlene.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.253
Take it.

25:06.421 --> 25:12.927
You shouldn't have come in here.
What's the matter? Are you okay?

25:14.179 --> 25:17.306
- Excuse me.
- Alex...

25:23.146 --> 25:29.610
Half those butt-nosed guys out there
will be having a heart attack.

25:30.153 --> 25:32.571
You'd better get out of here.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.450
I'll see you as soon as I get off.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.787
Don't go to sleep.
We've got some catching up to do.

25:40.288 --> 25:43.332
Is evertyhing okay?

25:46.336 --> 25:48.504
Get out of here.

26:19.244 --> 26:24.665
Mikhail, go back inside.
Ivan wants to talk to you.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.876
We were family. You betrayed us.

26:55.697 --> 26:56.905
Enough, Mikhail.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.370
Enough!

27:09.377 --> 27:10.878
This is your lucky day.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.721
Get in!

27:32.233 --> 27:34.777
Dynamite!

27:35.695 --> 27:37.905
- Was that Alex Bohemia?
- No.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.075
Good, it would've been
structural letdown.

27:41.242 --> 27:45.829
- Do you know this place?
- Yeah, it's a fleabag hotel.

27:45.997 --> 27:51.293
They say that Bret Easton Ellis
threw up in a fig tree.

27:51.461 --> 27:57.758
- Now the thing won't stop growing.
- Just relax.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.678
Thanks.

28:18.279 --> 28:21.949
- I'll wait here for you.
- Thank you for your help.

28:22.117 --> 28:27.705
Wait, we're not done yet. Find Alex.
My first chapter hangs on that.

28:27.872 --> 28:33.127
Go home and use your imagination
for chapter one.

28:51.479 --> 28:58.193
Last time I was here
I stayed in room 323.

28:58.361 --> 29:01.321
Is it available?

29:01.489 --> 29:07.494
- No. I've got 305 across the hall.
- That's fine.

29:25.430 --> 29:31.685
- Good evening, Mr. Dzasokhov.
- You're a very pretty girl, Alex.

29:32.395 --> 29:38.066
- The band is too loud.
- It's a birthday party.

29:39.235 --> 29:40.903
The band is too loud.

29:51.456 --> 29:56.126
Ten minutes, Yuri.
Ten minutes.

29:56.336 --> 30:01.840
All I asked was
that you hold Mikhail 10 minutes.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.092
Is that a long time?

30:07.555 --> 30:10.557
No, that is a very short time.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.147
How long can you hold your breath?

30:24.906 --> 30:31.453
A man I knew in Odessa could hold
his breath 5 minutes, 33 seconds.

30:34.582 --> 30:38.669
Did Mikhail talk to anyone
while he was here?

30:38.878 --> 30:42.130
Nicholas, please,
the man is trying to speak.

30:55.770 --> 30:59.857
He was talking...

31:00.024 --> 31:02.609
...to her.

31:10.618 --> 31:14.329
So what did you and Mikhail
talk about?

31:15.498 --> 31:18.917
I told him he had a phone call.

31:19.460 --> 31:24.172
- The caviar is fresh tonight.
- Did I tell you how pretty you are?

31:27.302 --> 31:33.724
Do you have any idea what will
happen to you if you lie to me?

31:35.184 --> 31:41.315
- I will never lie to you.
- If you lie to me, pretty girl...

31:41.482 --> 31:46.194
...you won't be pretty any more.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.369
Get back to work.

31:59.876 --> 32:02.711
What she needs is a good...

32:25.026 --> 32:27.194
What are you doing over there?

32:31.741 --> 32:34.034
I've missed you.

32:41.876 --> 32:47.047
You're so tense.
I'll help loosen you up.

32:54.764 --> 32:57.557
What's this?

32:57.725 --> 33:00.394
Are you playing hard to get?

33:05.066 --> 33:07.401
Is this a game?

33:08.820 --> 33:12.406
All right, have it your way.

33:13.366 --> 33:15.742
But no handcuffs this time.

33:25.336 --> 33:28.255
You've got a lot harder
since you went away.

33:37.765 --> 33:41.393
Ivan was all over me
after you left tonight.

33:41.769 --> 33:44.479
He kept asking me stuff.

33:44.647 --> 33:48.275
Did I talk to you?
What did I say?

33:49.110 --> 33:52.904
He's like something
that crawls out of an old pipe.

33:57.452 --> 34:01.038
In a few days,
this will all be behind us.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.257
I can't do it.

34:14.635 --> 34:18.221
I'm not Mikhail. He's dead.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.110
Come here.

34:55.842 --> 35:03.767
- The girl went up to 323.
- The room's empty. Did she leave?

35:08.856 --> 35:11.900
Do you recognise this man?

35:12.068 --> 35:18.782
- Yeah! He's in room 305.
- Room 305. Good, let's go!

35:34.882 --> 35:39.719
- I found this.
- Where did he go?

35:39.887 --> 35:44.057
Where did he go? Tell me!

35:58.948 --> 36:00.574
I want them dead.

37:08.267 --> 37:09.768
Hold it!

37:53.854 --> 37:57.023
Get in! Get in! Get in!

38:03.864 --> 38:06.032
Go!

38:57.585 --> 38:59.627
Keep moving.

39:10.681 --> 39:14.100
What's wrong? Are you okay?

39:37.291 --> 39:39.959
You were supposed to go home
and write.

39:41.587 --> 39:44.589
Who needs home?
I'm always working, anyway.

39:46.717 --> 39:50.470
I guess we got chapter one finished.

39:52.640 --> 39:57.977
- My God!
- Is this Alex Bohemia?

40:00.231 --> 40:07.153
Great. An unexpected development.
The whole thing's so scary.

40:18.833 --> 40:22.585
We've got to go. Come on.

40:32.513 --> 40:34.556
Come on.

40:44.900 --> 40:50.029
In the Zanzibar Club an unidentified
man and woman were being pursued...

40:51.699 --> 40:53.950
He was in trouble.

40:54.910 --> 40:57.454
He wouldn't admit it, though.

40:58.038 --> 41:01.291
He always said
he had everything under control.

41:02.418 --> 41:07.255
He had a lot of money put away.
Enough for a lifetime.

41:09.258 --> 41:15.138
He had a plan to get out of the mob.
I guess he was wrong.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.558
They found him.

41:20.519 --> 41:22.395
What did my brother mean to you?

41:27.568 --> 41:29.903
Everything.

41:30.613 --> 41:33.948
Take me to his place.
I want to get to know him.

41:34.116 --> 41:38.453
His place? Are you crazy?

41:38.621 --> 41:43.958
You almost got us killed. You don't
know who you're dealing with.

41:44.126 --> 41:49.088
If you want to kill yourself, okay,
but you're not risking my life.

41:49.632 --> 41:55.261
I can't go home or to work.
You've painted a target on my back.

41:56.931 --> 41:59.015
Where's the cheque?

42:25.459 --> 42:29.420
Mikhail used to say we can
never stay in one place too long.

42:29.755 --> 42:32.966
We have to move all the time.

42:33.133 --> 42:36.511
It's time for us to move.
They'll find us.

42:36.679 --> 42:39.973
The cabby didn't have to die,
you know.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.979
This is just the beginning.

42:46.146 --> 42:50.108
I've seen it before.
They won't stop until you're dead too.

42:59.368 --> 43:05.164
You can't go to the police.
You can't hide, they're relentless.

43:08.168 --> 43:12.672
All right, I'Il bring you
to your brother's home.

43:29.732 --> 43:33.359
This explains why Mikhail
picked a bank in Nice.

43:33.527 --> 43:37.697
It looks like
we've got another chance.

43:37.865 --> 43:41.618
How did he hide
a twin brother from us?

43:41.785 --> 43:47.040
Mikhail never contacted him.
We'd have known about it.

43:48.792 --> 43:55.548
In 56 hours the Nice bank opens
and we all make the headlines.

43:56.050 --> 43:57.884
And if that happens...

43:58.052 --> 44:01.763
...we'll be spending the rest of our
lives wondering how we screwed up.

44:02.473 --> 44:06.893
Washington doesn't like federal
agents working for the Russian mob.

44:07.061 --> 44:09.354
Our names are on that list.

44:12.316 --> 44:17.028
Get the brother. Convince him
to work with us in Nice.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.572
We don't have any options.

44:20.949 --> 44:22.450
We'll get him.

44:24.036 --> 44:29.582
Guys, keep this one alive.
I doubt if they were triplets.

44:32.503 --> 44:34.253
Triplets...

44:54.441 --> 44:56.818
Hey, Alex, what are you doing?

46:04.094 --> 46:05.261
Look at this mess.

46:53.769 --> 46:57.563
Tell me what you're looking for.
I'll help find it.

46:57.731 --> 47:00.066
I wouldn't know what to tell you.
I'm just looking.

47:09.368 --> 47:13.412
- What did you find?
- He knew about me.

47:20.170 --> 47:22.129
What did you do in the war?

47:22.422 --> 47:24.006
Sniper.

47:34.810 --> 47:38.229
Why wait five years to find me?

47:39.815 --> 47:43.276
Jimmy! You in there?

47:44.319 --> 47:48.656
Open up, you shithead!
This stuff's hot.

48:02.462 --> 48:04.797
This is not your lucky day.

48:10.679 --> 48:13.180
Tell your boss
to leave me the fuck alone!

49:16.703 --> 49:22.041
Ivan!
You look like your parrot died.

49:26.046 --> 49:30.383
- Mikhail's back.
- Bring him to me.

49:34.888 --> 49:38.557
How can I when I've got my hands
tied behind my back.

49:40.894 --> 49:43.437
Let me deal with him.

49:43.605 --> 49:47.608
This is not a democracy.
You do what I say, understand?

49:52.114 --> 49:55.282
Mikhail has caused no trouble.

49:55.450 --> 50:00.913
If the FBI had the list,
we'd be at war with the Italians.

50:01.081 --> 50:05.584
If he is here,
the list is still in France.

50:05.752 --> 50:12.091
Mikhail will take the proper
course of action. Bring him to me.

50:12.592 --> 50:16.762
I meant no disrespect.
I'm just worried.

50:16.930 --> 50:23.811
Remember when Goradni talked
to the FBI? And Pietro? And Andrea?

50:23.979 --> 50:30.276
I took care of them for you,
but Mikhail is different.

50:30.444 --> 50:34.947
I know you feel like he's your son.

50:40.370 --> 50:43.497
Yes, Dimitri.

50:44.124 --> 50:45.666
Is this also Mikhail's place?

50:45.834 --> 50:50.129
No, my friend's. Mikhail and I
used to come here to escape.

50:51.590 --> 50:55.509
You looked comfortable
handling that gun today.

50:55.969 --> 51:01.140
But you scared me when you
tried to drown him in the jacuzzi.

51:02.976 --> 51:06.312
I lost it. Sorry.

51:06.980 --> 51:12.359
- Have you been at the Bohemia long?
- About a year.

51:12.527 --> 51:15.988
I used to dance. Nightclubs.

51:16.490 --> 51:19.617
I make less money now,
but it's a little more respectable.

51:30.545 --> 51:33.172
I doubt you'll find anything here
of your brother's.

51:36.426 --> 51:38.761
It's worth trying.

51:41.348 --> 51:43.849
What did he do to make
all these people want to kill him?

51:49.606 --> 51:54.360
He talked about an insurance policy
that would keep him alive.

51:54.778 --> 52:00.741
The FBI was pressuring him
to turn evidence on Kirov.

52:02.035 --> 52:04.495
You think those aren't
enough reasons to kill him?

52:20.804 --> 52:23.889
The only time my brother
and I connected...

52:25.142 --> 52:27.560
...was when he died.

52:30.772 --> 52:33.440
We both lost something.

52:47.581 --> 52:50.416
Rise and shine, boys and girls.

52:54.713 --> 52:58.424
Agents Pellman and Loomis. FBI.

52:59.259 --> 53:00.926
How are you?

53:01.428 --> 53:04.513
Alex Bartlett and Alain Moreau.

53:05.765 --> 53:08.642
I believe we share mutual concerns.

53:09.603 --> 53:13.772
We know you're not Mikhail.
You're not part of the Russian mob.

53:14.357 --> 53:17.610
That's a first. What do you want?

53:19.613 --> 53:23.699
- The men who are trying to get you.
- And?

53:23.867 --> 53:28.370
Mikhail kept a detailed list.

53:28.538 --> 53:34.543
People, places, events.
The entire Russian mob operation.

53:34.920 --> 53:39.965
Mikhail was helping us with our
investigation of the Russian mob.

53:43.345 --> 53:47.973
He wanted to set things right.
He wanted to help us.

53:48.141 --> 53:52.394
He was going to give us the list
before he was killed.

53:53.521 --> 53:56.273
The list is in a safe deposite box
in a bank in Nice.

53:56.441 --> 54:01.862
In Nice we want you to pretend...

54:02.030 --> 54:08.327
- That I'm Mikhail.
- Exactly. We knew you'd help.

54:25.637 --> 54:30.599
But I don't. Can you protect her
from being killed?

54:30.767 --> 54:34.895
Can you protect me?
You sure didn't protect my brother.

54:35.939 --> 54:39.817
Hey, pal, we're your only hope.

54:41.194 --> 54:43.529
I'll take my chances.

54:45.573 --> 54:48.450
Why don't we try another approach?
Come here!

55:35.999 --> 55:42.004
- The FBI are supposed to help us.
- At gunpoint it's not called help.

55:42.172 --> 55:46.425
Who isn't trying to kill us
at this point?

55:46.593 --> 55:51.847
Did you believe the FBI when they
said Mikhail was working with them?

55:52.015 --> 55:58.604
- No way! He would've told me.
- They lied. They knew he was dead.

55:58.772 --> 56:06.028
The Russians didn't know that. They
weren't surprised to see me alive.

56:06.196 --> 56:10.991
- If they didn't kill him...
- Who else cares about the list?

56:12.911 --> 56:16.622
- The FBI.
- The FBI, yeah.

56:23.254 --> 56:26.340
- Where are you going?
- To see Kirov.

56:26.508 --> 56:28.384
Don't leave me. I'm coming with you.

56:32.889 --> 56:34.515
It's too dangerous.

56:35.975 --> 56:40.020
Can't believe this is happening again.
First Mikhail, now you.

56:41.314 --> 56:46.402
You've got to let me come with you.
We're in this together, right?

56:49.322 --> 56:55.285
Alex, I promise you
I'll come back for you.

56:57.914 --> 57:00.124
I promise.

57:16.266 --> 57:18.809
Take me to Kirov.

57:18.977 --> 57:20.519
Now.

57:39.456 --> 57:41.373
Sit down.

57:44.711 --> 57:47.045
Kirov asked me to bring him in.

58:02.854 --> 58:04.730
I'm so sorry, Kirov.

58:10.403 --> 58:12.738
Don't do it.

58:12.906 --> 58:14.907
Back off!

58:20.205 --> 58:24.583
I came to talk to Kirov.

58:25.877 --> 58:28.754
Mikhail?

58:28.922 --> 58:33.800
- You're not Mikhail. Who are you?
- I'm his brother.

58:34.010 --> 58:40.098
- Where is Mikhail?
- He's dead.

58:47.941 --> 58:52.402
- I see I got your attention.
- How did he die?

58:52.570 --> 58:57.074
- You tell me.
- I had nothing to do with it.

58:57.242 --> 58:59.785
You don't need your gun.
Your safe here.

58:59.953 --> 59:02.621
Your people tried to kill me.
They thought I was Mikhail.

59:02.789 --> 59:07.125
Impossbile. I wanted to speak to him,
not kill him.

59:07.293 --> 59:10.629
To speak? In what language?

59:10.797 --> 59:14.174
They tried to kill me
and almost succeeded.

59:25.728 --> 59:28.689
- Dimitri-
- Get out.

59:28.856 --> 59:32.651
- I just wanted-
- Get out!

59:45.957 --> 59:47.374
Go look after Ivan.

59:55.675 --> 59:57.426
Mikhail...

59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.846
I'm sorry. What is your name?

01:00:02.682 --> 01:00:07.853
- Alain.
- Alain. Come. We need to talk.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:52.898
Ivan and Mikhail,
they were like sons to me.

01:01:09.707 --> 01:01:12.042
I need a favour.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.088
I want to go back to Nice.

01:01:17.423 --> 01:01:19.174
Back home.

01:01:33.606 --> 01:01:37.442
Yes, I can help you.

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:41.571
Mikhail had a list
in a bank in Nice.

01:01:42.573 --> 01:01:46.618
Get it for me. We help each other.

01:02:53.519 --> 01:02:55.187
Go.

01:02:59.358 --> 01:03:01.526
Call an ambulance.

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:13.825
The other side! Get him!

01:06:16.722 --> 01:06:19.891
- Don't move!
- Okay, Peter Pan.

01:06:32.363 --> 01:06:34.406
Get in the car.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:18.742
I have a contract out on him. If you
stop protecting him, he'll be dead.

01:07:18.909 --> 01:07:24.622
Your problem is you don't think.
You kill. You're not Kirov.

01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:26.791
What did you say?

01:07:30.337 --> 01:07:35.633
- We need him to get the list.
- Why will he get you the list?

01:07:35.801 --> 01:07:41.514
Because you'll persuade him
to be a good boy in Nice.

01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:47.353
- And after?
- Give us 24 hours, then he's yours.

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:55.695
Ivan, we know you have an alibi,
but we know you had Kirov killed.

01:07:55.863 --> 01:07:58.823
So no more trouble, okay?

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:02.994
Listen! I'm running things now.

01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:07.332
That girl knows too much.
She's mine now.

01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:19.219
You have visitors.

01:08:44.411 --> 01:08:48.872
So I'm hoping a good night's sleep
is all you needed to see the light.

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:13.064
You win.

01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:36.462
In a few hours we go banking.
So try and get some rest.

01:09:50.227 --> 01:09:53.979
Don't worry, I've checked it out.
Everything's copacetic.

01:10:09.705 --> 01:10:11.831
What's the plan?

01:10:11.999 --> 01:10:14.250
We've got to get out of here.

01:10:15.836 --> 01:10:17.378
No plan.

01:10:18.505 --> 01:10:20.340
Nothing.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:27.388
Alain, about tomorrow...

01:10:27.556 --> 01:10:32.143
Tomorrow I really find out
who my brother was.

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:42.654
They're not gonna let us go
even when they get the list.

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:21.270
Monsieur Suverov, welcome again.
Is there anything I can do for you?

01:13:21.438 --> 01:13:27.318
- We'd just like to go in.
- The vault is for customers only.

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:32.156
- My colleague and I-
- I'm sorry, bank policy.

01:13:32.324 --> 01:13:35.827
Please, Monsieur Suverov,
come with me.

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:51.426
Please make yourself comfortable
and stay as long as you desire.

01:13:55.222 --> 01:14:00.852
Unfortunately we must go through
the identity protocol again.

01:14:01.019 --> 01:14:04.689
- Please, identify yourself.
- Mikhail Suverov.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:09.485
- The second name?
- Alain Moreau.

01:14:09.653 --> 01:14:12.697
- Your mother's Christian given name.
- Chantal Moreau.

01:14:14.032 --> 01:14:16.784
Clean and quiet.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.794
Here, monsieur.

01:14:28.088 --> 01:14:30.715
- Do you smoke?
- No.

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:33.551
- Can I get a cigarette?
- Of course.

01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:38.556
- And some gum.
- Certainly.

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:15.384
- I need to open my security box.
- May I see your ID?

01:15:16.553 --> 01:15:20.765
This is the one
under the name Alain Moreau.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:04.517
Only you could access this box...

01:16:04.685 --> 01:16:07.478
...therefore one of two things
ha s happened:

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:11.524
We are together again, a family...

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:16.028
...or I am dead,
and you shouldn't trust anyone.

01:16:16.196 --> 01:16:21.826
I know you are a great marksman,
so here is a gift. Your favourite.

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:27.290
One of the boxes contains evidence
against the FBI and the Russian mob.

01:16:27.457 --> 01:16:30.167
Hand it over to the U.S. Embassy.

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:41.220
When I found out about you,
it was luck. A newspaper.

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:45.975
The moment I saw the picture,
I knew I had a brother.

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:52.356
You reminded me I had a chance,
and I decided to quit the mob.

01:16:52.524 --> 01:16:57.862
I didn't contact you because
everything in my world is poison.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:03.200
I wanted to leave that life behind.
To reunite us.

01:17:03.368 --> 01:17:10.041
I'm sorry if that never happens.
Forgive me. Tell our mother...

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:15.880
...that I don't blame her for what she
did. The life I lived has taught me this.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:20.051
I only hope we are
listening to this tape together.

01:17:20.218 --> 01:17:27.183
The money is for you and our mother.
You are my only friend. God bless.

01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:06.639
Everything in the small box,
turn it over to the American Embassy.

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:09.975
- Understand?
- Perfectly, sir.

01:19:15.959 --> 01:19:17.835
Sit down. Just sit.

01:19:34.352 --> 01:19:35.811
Get the fuck out of here!

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:11.073
- We're clearing the building.
- We're not leaving without our guy.

01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:14.535
You can meet him outside.
Everyone is being cleared to the street.

01:21:17.163 --> 01:21:22.084
- Don't shoot. I'm a cop.
- We'Il see about that.

01:21:25.797 --> 01:21:27.756
Let's go.

01:22:20.518 --> 01:22:22.311
Sorry, sir.

01:22:24.814 --> 01:22:26.732
Let's go.

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:47.962
Put your hands where we can see
them and step out of the van.

01:22:50.715 --> 01:22:55.094
Keep your hands where we can see
them and step out of the van.

01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:58.889
Back it up!

01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:52.026
Get out!

01:23:56.489 --> 01:23:59.074
If you move, you die.

01:24:42.452 --> 01:24:45.329
Sebastien!

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:04.848
Sebastien. Come on.

01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:13.357
Me first. Get me out!

01:25:31.543 --> 01:25:33.919
Take a number.

01:25:41.886 --> 01:25:46.056
Don't leave me, please. I beg you.

01:25:47.892 --> 01:25:49.935
Help me!

01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:09.913
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, thank you.

01:26:16.087 --> 01:26:21.258
Two men took the girl with them,
that way.

01:26:43.072 --> 01:26:45.073
- Don't shoot.
- Where did they go?

01:26:45.241 --> 01:26:47.075
Down there.

01:27:15.021 --> 01:27:18.815
I need the car. Sorry.

01:27:29.327 --> 01:27:32.329
He's coming up.

01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:46.570
Try that again and you're dead!
You hear me?

01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:36.695
Come on.

01:30:54.365 --> 01:30:55.699
Alain!

01:30:58.202 --> 01:31:02.539
Listen! I know you don't have the list.

01:31:02.707 --> 01:31:04.958
But that doesn't matter now.

01:31:06.919 --> 01:31:08.545
I want the money.

01:31:09.881 --> 01:31:14.176
I know you have Mikhail's money
and I want it.

01:31:14.343 --> 01:31:18.555
Why don't you give it to me?
Then you walk.

01:31:19.765 --> 01:31:22.225
Do we have a deal?

01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:31.735
Do we have a deal? I will kill her!
Do you understand me?

01:32:58.698 --> 01:33:02.325
The Americans are ecstatic over
Mikhail's evidence.

01:33:02.493 --> 01:33:05.161
They've made dozens of arrests.

01:33:05.329 --> 01:33:08.498
And thanks to his money,
you can afford to eat here.

01:33:10.876 --> 01:33:14.963
Hello, Alain? Are you nervous
Alex meeting your mother?

01:33:17.133 --> 01:33:18.842
I'm not nervous.

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:24.014
Okay, I'm nervous.

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:29.894
Well, it's too late now.

01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:39.195
Wish me luck, okay?

01:33:47.371 --> 01:33:52.876
Do you feel okay?
It's no reason to be nervous.

01:33:53.044 --> 01:33:57.172
- I'm not nervous.
- Good.

01:33:59.925 --> 01:34:04.012
Let's take a walk. It's nearby.

01:34:05.514 --> 01:34:10.727
- It's relaxing.
- Good. One of us needs to relax.

01:34:12.605 --> 01:34:15.523
Do you know what you will say?

01:34:16.734 --> 01:34:19.069
I'm not asking you to lie.

01:34:19.403 --> 01:34:24.741
I don't need to lie. I'll tell
your mother the truth about Mikhail.

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:31.081
That he was kind and generous.

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:33.249
Honest.

01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:39.923
Just like his brother.

01:34:43.427 --> 01:34:44.886
Thank you.
