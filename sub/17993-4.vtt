Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

00:05.205 --> 00:08.108
{\an7}I've literally been
in the house for two years.

00:08.173 --> 00:09.275
{\an8}You can come out with me.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.745
{\an8}(Ray J) What are you doing?

00:09.342 --> 00:11.745
{\an9}Going out.

00:11.811 --> 00:14.214
{\an7}If she-- she don't
get in line and understand

00:14.280 --> 00:17.217
{\an8}that it's supposed to be me and
her, then it is what it is, man.

00:17.283 --> 00:18.885
{\an8}I had a conversation
with Miles.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.220
{\an8}And I'm like,
you know what?

00:20.286 --> 00:22.489
{\an7}Now you all of a sudden
have all these reservations.

00:22.555 --> 00:23.656
{\an7}And where is that
coming from?

00:23.723 --> 00:25.825
{\an8}I feel like
he might be cheating.

00:25.892 --> 00:27.394
{\an7}Now you trying to flip it
like it's a cheating thing?

00:27.460 --> 00:29.062
{\an8}Nobody's trying
to flip (bleep).

00:27.460 --> 00:29.062
{\an6}I can't--

00:29.129 --> 00:31.264
{\an7}I'm not doing this (bleep).
(bleep) it.

00:31.331 --> 00:32.932
{\an7}I'm still, like,
playing the field.

00:32.999 --> 00:35.034
{\an7}So if you want to sit here
and date me

00:35.101 --> 00:37.537
{\an7}while I'm dating around,
then that's up to you.

00:37.604 --> 00:40.373
{\an8}What are you doing?

00:37.604 --> 00:40.373
{\an8}Getting reading to hit the stu'.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.909
{\an8}Which means probably
gonna be girls around.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.779
{\an7}I'm feeling uneasy,
but I'm not about to be sleeping

00:45.845 --> 00:47.680
{\an7}one more night not knowing
what the (bleep) is going on.

01:32.091 --> 01:36.896
{\an8}My husband looking at

{\an1}Go back and smile

Hey.

{\an1}Oh, you didn't know?
You didn't know he was married.

01:55.415 --> 01:57.717
You wanna know why you didn't
know he was (bleep) married?

01:57.784 --> 01:59.419
{\an5}You wanna know why?

01:57.784 --> 01:59.419
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

{\an5}Brandi, these are my friends!

01:59.486 --> 02:02.789
{\an1}I don't give a (bleep)

02:02.856 --> 02:05.124
{\an1}Brother, family,
whatever the (bleep)!

02:05.191 --> 02:07.694
{\an1}This is why the bitch doesn't
know you (bleep) married!

02:07.760 --> 02:09.729
{\an1}Why don't you wear your ring
when you're going to the stu'--

02:09.795 --> 02:11.798
Brandi, you too strong
to be this little.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.500
{\an8}Don't let little
Brandi's size fool you.

02:13.566 --> 02:15.101
{\an8}She looks like
a sweet little thing,

02:15.168 --> 02:16.803
but under all of that
little sweetness

02:16.870 --> 02:18.605
is a linebacker
trying to get out.

02:18.671 --> 02:20.106
You're too strong to be
this little, Brandi.

02:20.173 --> 02:21.741

02:20.173 --> 02:21.741
Wait, wait, wait...

02:21.808 --> 02:23.977
All I know is nobody's getting
out this mother(bleep) room!

02:24.043 --> 02:25.912
That's what I do know!

02:25.979 --> 02:28.581
My husband and Ray
can call me crazy all day.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.049
Guess what?

02:30.116 --> 02:32.385
I knew what the hell
I was talking about.

02:32.452 --> 02:34.787
This is exactly why

02:34.854 --> 02:37.423
I launch
all of my missions.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.560
I will not be leaving here
until I get some answers

02:40.627 --> 02:43.796
about what the hell
is going on.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.231
You gonna bust up in
a (bleep) session, y'all?

02:45.298 --> 02:47.100
{\an1}I didn't have to bust up
on anything!

02:47.166 --> 02:50.870
{\an1}I seen my husband's ring
at home on--

02:50.937 --> 02:53.473
{\an1}Not on your finger,
but on the floor at home

02:53.540 --> 02:56.509
{\an5}for the fourth time.

02:53.540 --> 02:56.509
{\an1}So you gonna run up in this
mother(bleep) like Tupac?

02:56.576 --> 02:57.911
{\an1}Are you about to flip
this (bleep)?

02:57.977 --> 03:00.079
{\an1}That bitch arm was just on
your (bleep) shoulder

03:00.146 --> 03:01.514
and you have no ring on!

03:01.581 --> 03:03.716
I didn't even see her arm
on my shoulder, bro.

03:03.783 --> 03:05.118
Like, you're tripping.

03:05.184 --> 03:06.886
{\an5}(Max)
Brandi's going
over the top again.

03:06.953 --> 03:09.689
{\an8}At the end of the day, I'm just
working in my studio session

03:09.756 --> 03:11.391
{\an8}and she busting in
like the Feds.

03:11.457 --> 03:13.560
This ain't the first time
this has happened,

03:13.626 --> 03:16.129
but it needs to be
the last time.

03:16.195 --> 03:18.064
{\an5}What the (bleep)
is your problem?

03:16.195 --> 03:18.064
Well, let me ask you a question.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.832
Are you gonna feel like
I'm not (bleep) nobody

03:19.899 --> 03:21.501
{\an1}when I walk out the house
without my ring on?

03:21.568 --> 03:23.269
{\an5}Listen.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.269
How you gonna feel?

03:23.336 --> 03:25.104
{\an5}Listen, listen...

03:23.336 --> 03:25.104
I asked--
I'm not listening!

03:25.171 --> 03:26.472
You answer the question!

03:26.539 --> 03:28.207
{\an5}All right, listen.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.207
Just answer it!

03:28.274 --> 03:30.410
{\an4}I just want you to answer
my question one time.

03:28.274 --> 03:30.410
You're going crazy.

03:30.476 --> 03:32.345
{\an1}Like, you (bleep) up business,
you (bleep) up money.

03:32.412 --> 03:33.680
{\an5}That (bleep) ain't cool.

03:32.412 --> 03:33.680
{\an1}I'm don't give a (bleep)
about business.

03:33.746 --> 03:37.016
{\an5}That (bleep) ain't cool, bro.

03:33.746 --> 03:37.016
You know what?

03:37.083 --> 03:38.117
{\an1}You keep-- Get your ass
back in the studio

03:38.184 --> 03:39.485
{\an1}and answer the mother(bleep)
question.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.088
{\an1}How would you feel if you
walked (bleep) in my session

03:42.155 --> 03:44.691
and I got a (bleep)
and his arm on me

03:44.757 --> 03:46.526

my (bleep) ring on?

03:44.757 --> 03:46.526
Listen, listen...

03:46.593 --> 03:48.194
{\an7}I don't know what the (bleep)
you talking about, dude.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.194

You went Max Lux on that

Okay.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.959
When I need to vent,

04:20.026 --> 04:22.795
no doubt in my mind to hit up
my good friend Jason Lee.

04:22.862 --> 04:25.098
He's a blogger who knows
all the gossip in the town

04:25.164 --> 04:26.733
and he always gives me
the best advice.

04:26.799 --> 04:28.001

But today, I'm catching up with
one of my close friends, Kamiah,

04:57.463 --> 04:58.931
because in this town,

04:58.998 --> 05:01.701
true friends are
far and few between.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.970
{\an5}What's been going on with you?

05:01.768 --> 05:03.970
{\an3}Nothing.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.772
{\an1}How've you been?
How's the love life?

05:05.838 --> 05:09.175
{\an1}Um, love life is nonexistent,
but I've been good.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.510
{\an1}So you're not
with Fizz anymore?

05:10.576 --> 05:12.945
It went from,
like, fast pace,

05:13.012 --> 05:15.415
{\an1}spending every day together,
having so much fun,

05:15.481 --> 05:17.917
and it, like, just
out of nowhere went left.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.053
And he felt I was,
like, forcing things

05:20.119 --> 05:21.454
or I was trying
to move fast.

05:21.521 --> 05:22.989
And I'm sitting here
thinking to myself,

05:23.056 --> 05:25.692
"Okay, I don't have a child
that I'm having you watch.

05:25.758 --> 05:27.427
I didn't give myself
a key to your house,

05:27.493 --> 05:29.028
so how exactly
am I moving fast?"

05:29.095 --> 05:31.631
And compared me to
an appetizer.

05:31.698 --> 05:33.733
{\an5}Just some bull(bleep).

05:31.698 --> 05:33.733
Called you an appetizer?

05:33.800 --> 05:35.301
It's like, I'm just one
of his many appetizers.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.603
{\an1}Like, he was sampling
appetizers is what he said.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.472
{\an1}And I'm just looking at him
like, (bleep), what?

05:39.539 --> 05:41.674
Calling my girl Kamiah
an appetizer?

05:41.741 --> 05:43.943
Lil' Fizz might have
a big ego.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.513
{\an5}My girl Kamiah
has ballers 10 times bigger
than Fizz chasing her.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.615
{\an5}How was the sex?

05:47.580 --> 05:49.615
(laughs)

05:49.682 --> 05:51.551
Well, um...

05:51.617 --> 05:53.853
{\an1}when he was able to get it up,
it was-- it was decent.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.956
{\an5}(laughs)
He couldn't seem
to get stimulated,

05:57.023 --> 05:59.058
{\an5}I guess you could say.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.058
Even with you?

05:59.125 --> 06:01.427
{\an1}I thought maybe, okay,
you know, he's about to be 30.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.229
{\an5}Like, I don't know.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.229
I'm in my 30s.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.164
{\an1}I'm good.
It's not an issue.

06:05.231 --> 06:08.401
{\an4}Well, he might want to check
into the little blue pill
or something.

As one of the only
bloggers in Hollywood,

06:10.570 --> 06:12.839

07:10.830 --> 07:12.665

between us two.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.779
{\an5}Whoo.

07:25.011 --> 07:26.779
I like that take,
I like that take.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.381
{\an5}All right, all right.

07:26.846 --> 07:28.381
Ooh, that's hot.

07:28.447 --> 07:30.883
{\an1}What's up, man? You good?
Yeah, hanging in there, man.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.819
It's hot.

07:32.885 --> 07:33.820
Hi, Miles.

07:33.886 --> 07:35.021
{\an1}What's up, baby?
How you doing?

07:35.087 --> 07:36.856
{\an5}I'm good, how are you?

07:35.087 --> 07:36.856
That track is hot.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.324
{\an5}You like it?

07:36.923 --> 07:38.324
{\an1}Whoo!

07:38.391 --> 07:39.659
{\an5}That's the (bleep).

07:38.391 --> 07:39.659
Ain't no (bleep) chill.

07:39.725 --> 07:41.661
{\an5}Ain't got no chill, right?

07:39.725 --> 07:41.661
{\an3}Yeah.

07:41.727 --> 07:43.629
All right, I'm gonna go smoke me
a square real quick.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.498
{\an5}What's going on?

07:43.696 --> 07:45.498
{\an1}What's up?

07:45.565 --> 07:49.402
Thank you for letting me drop
in, you know, on your session.

07:49.468 --> 07:51.904
{\an5}Ooh! You recording
that new hit, huh?

07:49.468 --> 07:51.904
{\an1}You know.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.340
{\an5}That new-- that new--
that new summer hit?

07:51.971 --> 07:54.340
You know what I'm saying.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.242
{\an4}It's all about the grind
and hustle.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.242
Exactly.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.643
{\an1}Basically.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.812
{\an5}What's going on?

07:57.710 --> 07:59.812
{\an3}(sighs)

07:59.879 --> 08:03.382
Your best friend, um...

08:03.449 --> 08:06.185
{\an1}we just don't see eye to eye
on a lot of situations,

08:06.252 --> 08:08.020
you know, that we have
going on right now.

08:08.087 --> 08:11.891
And, um, I feel like
he doesn't understand me

08:11.958 --> 08:13.860
and my side of things

08:13.926 --> 08:16.762
{\an1}and where I'm coming from
when I deal with this (bleep).

08:16.829 --> 08:19.498
{\an4}And I struggle with this (bleep)
being a rapper in the game,
you know what I'm saying?

08:19.565 --> 08:21.701
{\an4}Yeah.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.701
Being judged on
who I lay with

08:21.767 --> 08:24.270
{\an5}rather than my talent
in jumping in the booth,
you know what I'm saying?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.838
{\an5}Being a rapper.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.838
{\an1}Yeah.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.607
I just want him
to understand, like,

08:27.673 --> 08:29.942
who I am, what I am,
what I stand for.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.477
This has been instilled.

08:32.544 --> 08:33.880
It's my way of living.

08:33.946 --> 08:35.548
It's my family.
It's my religion.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.316
{\an1}Right, but his heart
is involved, Miles, like...

08:37.383 --> 08:39.452
{\an5}I understand, but, look--

08:37.383 --> 08:39.452
Like, he doesn't know,
like, what's going on.

08:39.518 --> 08:42.488
{\an4}He even thinks that
you possibly, might,
like, be cheating on him.

08:42.554 --> 08:44.790
{\an1}And, I mean, you could,
like, keep it 100.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.426
{\an1}Like, are you
cheating on him?

08:47.493 --> 08:48.928
{\an5}Like, you got somebody--

08:47.493 --> 08:48.928
Am I cheating on him?

08:48.995 --> 08:50.329
Come on.
Come on, Haze.

08:50.396 --> 08:52.198
Cheating on him?
It's only been me and him.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.367
(Hazel-E)
It's good to hear face-to-face

08:54.433 --> 08:56.702
that Miles is not actually
cheating on Milan.

08:56.769 --> 09:00.106
And on that front, sitting here
looking into Miles' eyes,

09:00.172 --> 09:01.908
I actually feel for him.

09:01.974 --> 09:04.143
{\an1}In the beginning,
I wanted to believe for myself

09:04.210 --> 09:05.912
{\an5}that it was just sexual.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.912
{\an1}Okay.

09:05.978 --> 09:08.214
Like, I really never
imagined myself, like,

09:08.281 --> 09:10.316
{\an5}being in a relationship
with another man, you know
what I'm saying?

09:10.383 --> 09:11.951
Like, actually, like...

09:12.018 --> 09:13.819
{\an1}And you were clear with him
up front about this?

09:13.886 --> 09:15.321
He knew about this
from day one.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.390
{\an1}He knows about my religion.
He knows about my family.

09:17.456 --> 09:19.592
He knows I've been
raised in a church.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.127
I was the youth pastor.

09:21.193 --> 09:23.129
I led these youth
at my church.

09:23.195 --> 09:26.098
{\an1}How they gonna look at me
now I'm laying with another man?

09:26.165 --> 09:27.800
{\an5}How my pastor...

09:26.165 --> 09:27.800
{\an1}But you gotta be
a representation for...

09:27.867 --> 09:29.468
{\an4}you gotta--
you know what I'm saying?

09:27.867 --> 09:29.468
But at the end of the day--

09:29.535 --> 09:31.337
{\an1}Your talent is your talent,
your look is your look,

09:31.404 --> 09:34.941
{\an5}who you are is who you are,
who you lay with shouldn't
make a difference, period.

09:35.007 --> 09:38.110
{\an4}What do you do?
How do you still have respect
and be out in this game?

09:38.177 --> 09:39.979
(Hazel-E)
I really feel for Miles.

09:40.046 --> 09:43.950
I mean, hell, being a rapper
in this industry and being gay?

09:44.016 --> 09:45.484
It's an issue.

09:45.551 --> 09:48.587
The hip-hop industry
is still very homophobic.

09:48.654 --> 09:51.324
There's kinda this
unspoken code

09:51.390 --> 09:53.526
for zero tolerance for gays.

09:53.592 --> 09:56.128
And it's about time
that (bleep) ends.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.230
{\an5}I know it's not easy, like...

09:56.195 --> 09:58.230
Of course it's not--

09:58.297 --> 10:00.733
{\an5}I know it's not,
I know it's not.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.733
It's not easy, it's not.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.002
{\an5}It's easier said than done
and I don't know when
I'm gonna get over it.

10:03.069 --> 10:04.637
And I just need him
to understand that

10:04.704 --> 10:07.239
{\an5}just because it's easier
for him, it's not gonna
be easier for me.

10:07.306 --> 10:09.775
Like this (bleep)--
this (bleep) eats me up.

10:12.078 --> 10:14.914
{\an5}I don't think
anybody understands what
I'm going through right now.

10:14.981 --> 10:16.415
No matter who I love,

10:16.482 --> 10:19.552
I gotta be true to my own self
and move in my own pace.

10:19.618 --> 10:22.455
But the one thing that I know in
my heart is that I love Milan.

10:22.521 --> 10:25.758
And he all I got
through this whole situation.

10:25.825 --> 10:28.194
I'm just not where he's at
and he has to respect that.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.929
If he loves me,
if he's in love with me,

10:29.996 --> 10:31.931
I'm just not where he is.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.700
All I can do
is try to show him

10:34.767 --> 10:36.302
that I love him
and I do want this.

10:36.369 --> 10:39.105
And I'm willing to do
something now, today.

10:39.171 --> 10:41.607
{\an1}He ain't talking to me, he ain't
answering none of my texts.

10:41.674 --> 10:44.744
{\an1}I'll do something today
to show him that I want this.

10:44.810 --> 10:48.247
{\an4}If you feel the way you do about
him and you want him around,
you know what I'm saying?

10:48.314 --> 10:50.850
You need to do some,
like, grand mafioso.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.019
Like, I'm gonna need some, like,
Richard Gere in "Pretty Woman."

10:53.085 --> 10:55.588
Like, you know, like,
some lights in the--

10:55.654 --> 10:57.256
{\an1}my name in the Goodyear Blimp
or something.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.225
{\an5}Like, I need something like...

10:57.323 --> 10:59.225
{\an3}(laughing)

10:59.291 --> 11:01.427
{\an1}...like, extravagant
to show me that--

11:01.494 --> 11:02.728
{\an1}why I should still
deal with you.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.864
{\an4}'Cause he's a fly dude,
like...

11:02.795 --> 11:04.864
{\an3}Right.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.632
I definitely
want to show him.

11:06.699 --> 11:08.167
{\an5}I definitely want
to let him know.

11:06.699 --> 11:08.167
If you don't want to lose him.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.635
No. No, I'm not
gonna lose him.

11:09.702 --> 11:11.404
{\an5}I'm not gonna lose him.

11:09.702 --> 11:11.404
{\an1}Okay.

11:11.470 --> 11:13.806
So I definitely
need to show him

11:13.873 --> 11:15.374
that I'm here
for the long run.

11:15.441 --> 11:18.110
{\an1}Well, then I-- the next phone
call I should get from him,

11:18.177 --> 11:21.313
I need him to be sounding like
a giddy high school girl, okay?

11:21.380 --> 11:22.915
{\an3}Okay.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.918
{\an1}Need him to be happy Miles again
'cause I'm here for you guys.

11:25.985 --> 11:28.821
{\an4}And if you ever need
anybody to vent to,
you know what I'm saying?

11:28.888 --> 11:32.758
{\an4}I might be here, there,
whatever, but it's just,
hey, I'm a phone call away.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.760
{\an5}Thank you, thank you, thank you.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.760
Give me a hug.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.629
I love you for that.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.297
{\an7}Why are you not
wearing your ring?

11:38.364 --> 11:39.899
{\an8}Why would I wear a ring

11:39.965 --> 11:41.934
{\an8}to represent a crazy
person like you...

11:42.001 --> 11:43.269
{\an7}Really?

11:42.001 --> 11:43.269
{\an8}...who doesn't respect my space?

11:43.335 --> 11:44.537
{\an8}A crazy person like me?

11:43.335 --> 11:44.537
{\an9}Yeah.

11:44.603 --> 11:45.638
{\an8}Let me tell you something.

11:45.704 --> 11:46.672
{\an7}Since you care about
this ring so much?

11:46.739 --> 11:48.307
{\an9}Mm-hmm.

11:46.739 --> 11:48.307
{\an8}You can have it.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.443
{\an7}Nikki, you damn sure not
gonna talk to me like that

11:50.509 --> 11:52.144
{\an8}'cause I'll beat your ass.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.144
{\an9}Please do.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.312
{\an8}So don't do that (bleep).

11:52.211 --> 11:53.312
{\an9}Please do.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.647
{\an8}No, you need to go.

12:00.753 --> 12:04.990
♪ We gonna step up

12:05.057 --> 12:08.394
{\an8}♪ We gotta do it our way ♪

12:21.340 --> 12:23.008
{\an8}So now that
I set Kamiah straight,

12:23.075 --> 12:24.944
{\an8}I figured I'd take me
a night off,

12:25.010 --> 12:28.013
{\an8}go to the club, see what other
tasty things is on the menu.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.349
And of course,
I bump into Nikki.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.385
{\an5}And being that
that's the sweetest thing
I tasted in a minute,

12:33.452 --> 12:35.721
I figured
I'll order that again.

12:35.788 --> 12:38.924
...way too much, Nia.

12:45.564 --> 12:47.133
{\an1}Can I borrow you
for a second?

12:47.199 --> 12:49.935
You can borrow me
for two seconds.

12:50.002 --> 12:52.238
{\an5}Two? That's it?

12:50.002 --> 12:52.238
That's it. Or three.

12:52.304 --> 12:55.007
Me and Nikki saw each other
for a little bit last year,

12:55.074 --> 12:56.909
but to be honest,
it never really seemed like

12:56.976 --> 12:59.378
she let go of the baggage
from her last relationship.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.380
But your boy
don't give up that easy,

13:01.447 --> 13:03.849
especially when a body
like that is involved.

13:03.916 --> 13:06.619
{\an5}You-You single now?

13:03.916 --> 13:06.619
I am single.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.687
{\an4}I heard.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.687
What have you been doing?

13:08.754 --> 13:10.089
I was dating.

13:10.156 --> 13:11.757
You (bleep) with them
little weak bitches.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.325
{\an5}Oh.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.325
{\an3}That's why.

13:13.392 --> 13:14.894
The shade is real.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.128
{\an5}(Nikki)
I heard that Fizz
is messing around

13:16.195 --> 13:18.030
with some basic chick
named Kamiah.

13:18.097 --> 13:21.200
{\an8}What I really don't like
is that she's on social media
calling me plastic.

13:21.267 --> 13:24.003
Everybody knows you don't mess
around with Miss Nikki Baby.

13:24.069 --> 13:27.006
{\an5}So is that out the picture?

13:24.069 --> 13:27.006
That's completely
out the picture.

13:27.072 --> 13:28.807
So were you guys
even a couple or what?

13:28.874 --> 13:31.477
{\an1}Right now, I don't have
no main courses, you know?

13:31.544 --> 13:33.846
So what do you have
right now?

13:33.913 --> 13:35.481
Appetizers.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.849
What's an appetizer?

13:36.916 --> 13:38.684
Not you.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.452
Of course not.
You know what I am?

13:40.519 --> 13:43.689
{\an1}I'm an appetizer,
a main course, and a dessert

13:43.756 --> 13:46.625
{\an1}with sprinkles and chocolate
and a cherry, all that, on top.

13:46.692 --> 13:48.360
{\an5}Word?

13:46.692 --> 13:48.360
Yes, that's what I am.

13:48.427 --> 13:49.995
{\an1}So you gonna let me
take you out?

13:50.062 --> 13:51.964
{\an1}You gonna let me
do what I need to do?

13:52.031 --> 13:54.166
{\an1}If I think you're worth it,
I'll let you.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.669
{\an1}You funny.
You are so funny.

it's my good old friend Apryl

it's the journalist in me

{\an8}that wants to get
the other side of the story,

21:47.906 --> 21:49.374

I just want to know

why he did my girl
Kamiah like that.

{\an4}Why?

21:55.313 --> 21:58.050
I know, he just,
like, invited himself.

21:58.116 --> 22:00.552

I'm just--

come and say hello.

she told me a little bit about

22:11.496 --> 22:14.232
{\an5}what's going on with you two.

22:11.496 --> 22:14.232
Yeah, and what was that?

{\an1}She said that she thought
you were together.

22:16.535 --> 22:17.736

22:16.535 --> 22:17.736
They were never together.

22:17.803 --> 22:19.471
We were dating.

22:19.538 --> 22:21.473

you feel like it's a wrap?

22:21.540 --> 22:23.241
It's been a wrap.
I told her that.

something else?

wouldn't even get out of bed,

And although she seemed
totally sincere about it,

28:42.887 --> 28:46.191
I'm starting to wonder if
Teairra is the one who told him.

28:46.257 --> 28:48.293
{\an5}So what's been going on?

28:46.257 --> 28:48.293
So much has been going on.

28:48.359 --> 28:50.395
Oh, Lord.
What?

28:50.462 --> 28:52.197
You know, I've been
hanging out with Teairra.

28:52.263 --> 28:54.099
{\an5}That's good.

28:52.263 --> 28:54.099
I've been hanging out
with Teairra.

28:54.165 --> 28:57.135
Yeah, it's good.
She invited me to a party.

28:57.202 --> 28:58.603
{\an5}Okay.

28:57.202 --> 28:58.603
{\an3}With Drake.

28:58.670 --> 29:01.005
And she told me
not to tell anybody.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.274
Next thing you know,
Ray is asking me,

29:03.341 --> 29:05.343
{\an1}what am I doing at
Drake's house with Teairra?

29:05.410 --> 29:07.445
{\an1}Well, how the hell he find
that -- out, Princess?

29:07.512 --> 29:09.948
{\an5}How do you think he found out?

29:07.512 --> 29:09.948
So basically, you saying
that you think Teairra--

29:10.014 --> 29:12.450
{\an5}I feel like I got set up.

29:10.014 --> 29:12.450
{\an1}But they don't--
they don't talk no more.

29:12.517 --> 29:14.185
I got set up.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.888
{\an8}It's hard for me to believe
that Teairra is spilling
secrets to Ray.

29:16.955 --> 29:19.324
{\an8}Especially after
I've spoken to her on my own

29:19.390 --> 29:21.860
{\an8}and she's told me
she's completely over him.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.395
So I'm gonna try to remain
as neutral as I possibly can

29:24.462 --> 29:27.332
and hoping that there's
no funny business going on.

29:27.398 --> 29:29.801
What do you think her purpose
would be to do that, though?

29:29.868 --> 29:33.571
{\an5}Think about it.

29:29.868 --> 29:33.571
To put a bug in his ear
so that he won't trust me.

29:33.638 --> 29:36.241
What benefit does she have
by being my friend?

29:36.307 --> 29:38.676
{\an1}If she set your ass up,
like, that's -- up.

29:38.743 --> 29:40.845
{\an4}Teairra need to get
slapped for that.
She know better.

29:40.912 --> 29:42.881
{\an1}I ain't gonna slap her,
but I'm gonna test her ass.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.582
{\an5}Why don't you just ask her?
Why don't you just be like--

29:42.947 --> 29:44.582
{\an3}No.

29:44.649 --> 29:46.017
I'm gonna test her,
because if I ask her,

29:46.084 --> 29:48.052
{\an5}she's not gonna tell me.

29:46.084 --> 29:48.052
Okay, what you gonna do?

29:48.119 --> 29:50.622
Set her up like I feel
like she set me up.

29:50.688 --> 29:52.624
What I'm gonna do is...

29:52.690 --> 29:55.226
{\an5}What you 'bout to do?

29:52.690 --> 29:55.226
...the rat trap.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.495
{\an5}You about to text her?

29:55.293 --> 29:57.495
I am going to see

29:57.562 --> 30:00.865
{\an1}if she wants to come to Vegas
for a girls' weekend.

30:00.932 --> 30:03.868
Now, of course,
I'm not really going to Vegas,

30:03.935 --> 30:07.138
{\an5}but if Ray finds out
about this little invitation
that I gave to Teairra,

30:07.205 --> 30:09.440
then I know that girl
is playing games.

30:09.507 --> 30:13.545
"Hey, girl.
Wanna come to Vegas?"

30:13.611 --> 30:15.079
So we'll see.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.081
If it gets back to Ray...

30:17.148 --> 30:20.318
{\an5}Then you know this time.

30:17.148 --> 30:20.318
...then I know. Yeah.

30:20.385 --> 30:22.720
If she don't fall for it,
then we cool.

30:24.455 --> 30:26.991
{\an8}Hazel, Hazel!

30:24.455 --> 30:26.991
{\an8}Mad because you've never
escalated to a media--

30:27.058 --> 30:29.394
{\an8}(bleep) or a high-end blog
that people--

30:27.058 --> 30:29.394
{\an4}Hazel!

30:29.460 --> 30:30.828
{\an8}Eat that, bitch.

30:36.968 --> 30:39.103
♪♪

30:44.909 --> 30:47.111
{\an8}(Nikki)
Even though Fizz
warned me about Jason Lee,

30:47.178 --> 30:49.480
I want to start generating
some buzz for my fashion line

30:49.547 --> 30:50.848
and I heard he's the best.

30:50.915 --> 30:52.784
At the end of the day,
business is business,

30:52.850 --> 30:55.987
so I'm gonna hear what he can do
for me and take it from there.

30:56.054 --> 30:57.255
I have a lingerie line
I'm working on

30:57.322 --> 30:58.856
{\an5}called Nude By Nikki.

30:57.322 --> 30:58.856
Okay.

30:58.923 --> 31:00.391
{\an1}That's why I wanted to sit down
with you and ask you, like,

31:00.458 --> 31:03.027
{\an1}okay, you're good at blogging,
you're good at marketing.

31:03.094 --> 31:05.930
{\an4}I can help you with,
you know, different bloggers,
different relationships.

31:05.997 --> 31:07.565
{\an1}I can help you
really push it out.

31:07.632 --> 31:09.100
{\an5}I would really
appreciate that.

31:07.632 --> 31:09.100
{\an1}Yeah.

31:09.167 --> 31:10.535
{\an1}I'm excited,
I want to help you.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.670
{\an7}Also, I was actually thinking
about hiring your--

31:12.737 --> 31:15.373
{\an7}Or just having-- working with
Hazel, because she used to be--

31:15.440 --> 31:18.543
{\an5}Hazel-- Hazel-E?

31:15.440 --> 31:18.543
{\an3}Yes.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.078
You know, she used to be
a publicist, so...

31:20.144 --> 31:21.879
No, she didn't.

31:21.946 --> 31:24.682
Hazel-E, AKA Erica, was,
you know, like an intern,

31:24.749 --> 31:26.985
{\an4}somebody you find off
the Internet that doesn't
have much to do,

31:27.051 --> 31:29.153
{\an1}so you get them to come
and work for you for free

31:29.220 --> 31:30.722
{\an1}in order to get
"experience"?

31:30.788 --> 31:33.124
{\an1}She took that and ran with it,
but she's not a publicist.

31:33.191 --> 31:35.827
{\an8}I know all the celebrities,
bloggers, influencers,

31:35.893 --> 31:37.929
{\an8}agents, managers,
promoters in Hollywood,

31:37.996 --> 31:39.197
{\an8}and Hazel is not one of them.

31:39.264 --> 31:40.932
{\an8}She's a non-mother(bleep)
factor.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.835
She might have everybody fooled
thinking that she's important,

31:43.901 --> 31:46.004
but all the people
that I run with

31:46.070 --> 31:47.472
know that Hazel
is a fraud.

31:47.538 --> 31:50.108
Birds of a feather flock
together and ducks cluck.

31:50.174 --> 31:53.344
{\an1}I'm just saying,
who you roll with matters.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.947
{\an4}You know, with that being said,
I actually did invite Hazel
over here--

31:56.014 --> 31:58.416
{\an4}Here?

31:56.014 --> 31:58.416
Yeah.

31:58.483 --> 32:02.186
{\an5}For what?

31:58.483 --> 32:02.186
{\an1}Because I wanted to discuss
with her some branding ideas.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.590
I had no idea that Jason
and Hazel had any issues,

32:05.657 --> 32:08.326
or else I would have never put
them in the same room together.

32:08.393 --> 32:10.361
I just thought he could
help my business in the blog,

32:10.428 --> 32:12.497
Hazel can help me
with the PR stuff,

32:12.563 --> 32:13.998
and then we could
all work together.

32:14.065 --> 32:17.735
{\an6}Hey.

32:14.065 --> 32:17.735
Haze. Hey, boo.

32:17.802 --> 32:20.538
I wanted to get
you guys' both input,

32:20.605 --> 32:23.708
but I don't want there
to be animosity because...

32:23.775 --> 32:26.577
{\an5}one of you or both of you
want to feel a certain way
towards each other.

32:26.644 --> 32:30.281
{\an5}(Hazel-E)
I didn't know Jason Lee's
low-key messy ass would be here.

32:30.348 --> 32:33.284
{\an8}I've bumped into Jason Lee
a few times around town,

32:33.351 --> 32:36.220
{\an8}but I'd be lying if I said
it was a pleasant experience.

32:36.287 --> 32:39.157
He's someone that I was warned
never to get close to.

32:39.223 --> 32:41.159
He's done so much
backstabbing

32:41.225 --> 32:42.827
to people that I know
in this industry,

32:42.894 --> 32:46.464
he gives a new name
to Hollywood fake.

32:46.531 --> 32:49.133
{\an1}She said you were a publicist.
I didn't recall that.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.535
I think I made
a lot of people famous.

32:50.601 --> 32:52.170
{\an5}I don't-- Who?

32:50.601 --> 32:52.170
I think that my track record--

32:52.236 --> 32:55.206
{\an4}Who?

32:52.236 --> 32:55.206
{\an1}Actually, I know my first
kingpin was Gnarls Barkley.

32:55.273 --> 32:58.576
{\an1}We have the-- the photos, the
backstage, the Grammy awards...

32:58.643 --> 33:01.346
{\an4}I mean, I can take a photo
with Lauryn Hill, but that
doesn't make me a Fugee.

33:01.412 --> 33:04.515
I'm just saying, I know all
the publicists in Hollywood.

33:04.582 --> 33:05.850
I didn't know you
to be a publicist.

33:05.917 --> 33:07.919
{\an1}I knew you to be
an aspiring artist.

33:07.985 --> 33:09.954
Don't get mad 'cause
I live now, shorty.

33:10.021 --> 33:11.489
{\an5}Just because I used to be a PR--

33:10.021 --> 33:11.489
It's not about living.

33:11.556 --> 33:13.991
{\an5}And I put myself on.

33:11.556 --> 33:13.991
But you were homeless, too.

33:14.058 --> 33:15.393
{\an5}That's the thing.

33:14.058 --> 33:15.393
But you were homeless.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.862
{\an5}I've never been homeless.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.862
You wanna talk about that?

33:17.929 --> 33:19.597
{\an5}Yes, I would.

33:17.929 --> 33:19.597
Dr. Nicki's house.

33:19.664 --> 33:22.166
{\an5}You're mad 'cause
you've never escalated--

33:19.664 --> 33:22.166
We can go through my inbox.

33:22.233 --> 33:25.703
{\an5}Hazel, Hazel!

33:22.233 --> 33:25.703
{\an1}...media takeout or
a high-end blog that people--

33:25.770 --> 33:27.105
{\an1}Now.

33:28.239 --> 33:30.208
Eat that, bitch.

33:30.274 --> 33:32.410
{\an5}(Nikki)
Are you (bleep) serious
right now?

33:32.477 --> 33:33.778
I don't care,
bad blood or not,

33:33.845 --> 33:35.780
what type of man throws
a drink in a woman's face.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.181
Are you (bleep) joking?

33:37.248 --> 33:38.950
My eyes are burning.

33:39.016 --> 33:42.420
And when I can
(bleep) open them again,

33:42.487 --> 33:44.756
I don't even need nobody
to (bleep) him up.

33:44.822 --> 33:46.591
I'm gonna do it.

33:53.164 --> 33:56.067
{\an8}(Amber)
I haven't seen Miles since he
popped up at the dance studio

33:56.134 --> 33:58.069
{\an8}to see my daughter
Zoey rehearse.

33:58.136 --> 33:59.570
{\an8}I love being around him,

33:59.637 --> 34:03.341
{\an8}but then he disappears
for days and weeks.

34:03.408 --> 34:05.243
How are you?

34:05.309 --> 34:07.178
{\an4}I'm good, how are you,
sweet face?

34:05.309 --> 34:07.178
Good.

34:07.245 --> 34:10.081
{\an5}(Amber)
So I called Teairra
and Moniece for a little lunch

34:10.148 --> 34:12.382
to vent because I had enough.

34:12.449 --> 34:15.353
{\an5}Cheers.

34:12.449 --> 34:15.353
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.688
{\an7}What's going on,
Miss Amber.

34:17.755 --> 34:21.092
{\an7}(singsongy)
You know we have to know
what the tea is.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.326
{\an8}I mean, I don't know.

34:22.393 --> 34:25.062
I just want this man
to act right.

34:25.129 --> 34:26.563
Is that too much?

34:26.630 --> 34:28.331
{\an3}He's like,
"Oh, well,

34:28.399 --> 34:30.534
if you be patient,
we'll get more results."

34:30.601 --> 34:32.003
But hold on.

34:32.069 --> 34:35.172
How 'bout
you at strip clubs,

34:35.239 --> 34:36.440
you're partying.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.042
What about
me and you time?

34:38.109 --> 34:40.210
{\an1}Like, how long before
you feel like...

34:40.277 --> 34:41.813
(Teairra)
Enough is enough.

34:41.879 --> 34:44.315
{\an1}I mean, like, is it
gonna be 15 years? 20 years?

34:44.382 --> 34:46.384
{\an1}The next time I see him, you
know, I want to talk with him.

34:46.451 --> 34:49.187
One more chance
to tell me what it is.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.656
{\an1}If not, I'm not gonna
accept none of his (bleep).

34:51.722 --> 34:53.391
I don't want to hear
(bleep) else he has to say

34:53.458 --> 34:55.226
unless I see us
moving forward.

34:55.293 --> 34:57.628
I've been waiting,
waiting, and waiting

34:57.695 --> 34:59.564
for Miles' ass
to get in gear.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.666
I'm at a point to where
I just gotta know--

35:01.732 --> 35:03.901
do we have
a future together or not?

35:03.968 --> 35:06.471
If not, I can keep
my fabulous ass moving.

35:06.537 --> 35:07.805
'Cause this (bleep)
ain't working.

35:07.872 --> 35:10.041
But enough about me
and this man.

35:10.107 --> 35:11.175
What's up with you?

35:11.242 --> 35:14.812
{\an8}I talked to my new BFF.

35:14.879 --> 35:17.114
{\an8}Princess.

35:14.879 --> 35:17.114
{\an9}(gasps)

35:17.181 --> 35:18.316
Who-cess?

35:18.382 --> 35:21.519
So listen, she texts me
to go to Vegas.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.121
Yeah.

35:24.188 --> 35:25.957
{\an1}You don't think she's up to
something by reaching out to you

35:26.023 --> 35:27.725
{\an5}and just pouring
her heart out to you?

35:26.023 --> 35:27.725
That's what I was gonna say.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.827
{\an1}I think she could be
trying to use Teairra.

35:29.894 --> 35:31.162
{\an5}Remember, think about that.

35:29.894 --> 35:31.162
Use me for what, though?

35:31.229 --> 35:33.130
{\an5}To get under Ray's skin.

35:31.229 --> 35:33.130
Trust me.

35:33.197 --> 35:35.733
{\an4}She's probably thinking the
same (bleep) you're thinking.

35:33.197 --> 35:35.733
Oh, well, that's good.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.401
{\an4}But you have to be
the smarter bitch...

35:35.800 --> 35:37.401
That's good.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.470
{\an5}...and beat her
at her own game.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.470
What I am gonna do

35:39.537 --> 35:42.807
is send the text message to Ray
and (bleep) with his head.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.809
{\an5}You are so evil right now.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.809
No, I'm not.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.611
{\an1}Your eyes lit up and
everything when you said that.

35:46.677 --> 35:47.879
Karma's a bitch.

there's one little issue

{\an5}Today, Kamiah
is supposed to pick up
her stuff from Fizz' house.

36:41.299 --> 36:43.434
So I figure I'll stick around
for some moral support,

36:43.501 --> 36:46.337

piece of my mind myself.
