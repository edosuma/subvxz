10:55.455 --> 10:56.890
That's unbelievable.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.291
Ckk, ckk, ckk, ckk, ckk.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.693
Chh, chh!

10:59.727 --> 11:01.094
Chh!
I don't give
a shit.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.295
She's 14 years old.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.864
In 10 years,
she'll be 24 years old,

11:03.897 --> 11:05.298
and this idea could be worth
a billion dollars.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.734
We're not giving her
the money.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.268
Okay? We can come up
with another idea

11:08.301 --> 11:09.970
or a trust fund or something,
but we're not giving a her --

11:10.003 --> 11:11.304
Yes,
that sounds great.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.306
Yeah, we'll put $20,000
in a trust fund.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.808
[Door opens, blinds clatter]

11:18.879 --> 11:20.814
We talked.

11:20.848 --> 11:24.718
And we think
that $5,000 --

11:24.752 --> 11:26.053
I don't want money.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.454
I want to work on it.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.022
Deal.
What? Wh--

11:29.056 --> 11:30.457
I want to be able
to come here and work on it

11:30.490 --> 11:32.392
instead of going to school
for one period.

11:32.425 --> 11:33.927
Well,
we could --

11:33.961 --> 11:35.295
It can be
my independent study.
Mm.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.030
No problem.
We'll wire that up right away.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.166
Now, I understand
you have to get back to English,

11:39.199 --> 11:41.769
so we're gonna
talk about this after school.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.804
Gordon, we'll meet
at your place?

11:45.272 --> 11:47.174
Sure.

11:47.207 --> 11:51.211
[Indistinct conversations]

11:55.448 --> 11:58.218
Is their firewall
as strong as it sounds?

11:58.251 --> 12:00.854
Donna: Third-generation,
application layer.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.089
They're very talented.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.091
Put on
a good show, too.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.459
Speaking of
putting on a show...

12:06.493 --> 12:09.029
Look at him.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.932
For all his quirks,
it's good he's a partner.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.867
He brings in deals.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.369
He's trying to outflank me
on the browser front.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.305
Few weeks ago,
he shits all over Millennium.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.873
Now he's cozying up
to Spyglass?

12:19.907 --> 12:22.910
Well, he didn't mention
anything to me.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.312
Maybe he just wants
to work with you.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.114
Oh,
there's Nina Klein.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.515
I should
go say hi.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.450
You go ahead.
I'm gonna...

12:30.483 --> 12:32.886
Man: Hey, Donna,
well-done.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.421
Really good.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.098
Grab a seat?
Yeah, we should.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.271
Well, uh, [Chuckles]
Joe Lieberman can blow me.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.506
Hey, Doom is just
the tip of the iceberg, okay?

12:53.540 --> 12:55.175
That's the future,
full stop.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.410
No. Sorry.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.813
I'm not sure
I totally agree.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.014
Look,
I haven't played Doom,

13:01.048 --> 13:03.550
but it's not because
it's so violent,

13:03.583 --> 13:05.585
because to me,
it seems boring.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.987
[Scoffs]

13:07.020 --> 13:08.388
You kidding me?
It's addictive.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.589
Yeah,
it's a Skinner box --

13:09.622 --> 13:11.291
a lot
of these games are.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.026
They're slot machines,
so they'll keep you coming back,

13:13.060 --> 13:14.862
but they're not gonna
fulfill you in any way.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.063
Look,
all I'm saying is,

13:16.096 --> 13:17.364
I think there's room
in the future

13:17.397 --> 13:19.900
for more than just gory,
first-person shooters.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.102
I think we have another --
another question.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.837
Woman:
This question's for Cameron.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.305
Hi.
I was wondering

13:25.338 --> 13:27.440
if you could talk about
your new game, Pilgrim.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.576
I saw the release date
was changed.

13:29.609 --> 13:33.280
Yeah, Atari has been
a really supportive partner

13:33.313 --> 13:35.048
in collaborating
on this game,

13:35.082 --> 13:37.951
and they are just taking
a bit of extra time

13:37.985 --> 13:39.586
to figure out
the best strategy.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.155
But, um,
it's coming.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.524
I'm excited
about it.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.994
I think
you will be, too.

13:47.027 --> 13:50.063
Do you have, like, a ballpark
time when it'll be done?

13:52.132 --> 13:55.002
It's done now.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.970
[Audience murmuring]
In terms of release,

13:57.004 --> 14:00.307
that would be
a question for Atari.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.475
Cool thing
about games you download,

14:02.509 --> 14:05.145
in terms of release,
there's less overhead,

14:05.178 --> 14:09.016
which means less interference,
meaning more blood.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.484
[Cheers and applause]

14:11.518 --> 14:14.254
Eugene: Do we have
any other questions --

14:14.287 --> 14:15.522
Yeah, I mean...

14:15.555 --> 14:17.624
Yeah, anytime you can
cut out a middle man,

14:17.657 --> 14:19.326
it's a good thing,
right?

14:19.359 --> 14:21.594
Like I said, I have
a great relationship with Atari,

14:21.628 --> 14:22.996
a lot
of mutual respect,

14:23.030 --> 14:25.999
but there have been times
in my career

14:26.033 --> 14:28.635
where my choices
were not as respected.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.503
W-- Okay.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.505
If there aren't, uh,
any more questions,

14:32.539 --> 14:34.541
I think
that about does it for us.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.376
Uh, thank you all
for coming.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.644
[Applause]
Um, thanks to our guests,
Tommy and --

14:37.677 --> 14:41.381
I have a question
for Ms. Howe.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.283
Hello, Donna.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.518
I was hoping
you could talk a bit about

14:45.552 --> 14:49.022
the relationship between
a creator, such as yourself,

14:49.056 --> 14:51.191
and the business side
of gaming.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.592
You seemed
to indicate earlier

14:52.625 --> 14:54.427
that there was some difficulty
for you there,

14:54.461 --> 14:55.662
and I was wondering
if you felt

14:55.695 --> 14:58.298
you had any culpability
in that.

14:58.331 --> 15:02.135
Well, it's inherently
a fraught relationship, right?

15:02.169 --> 15:04.537
Huh. How so?

15:04.571 --> 15:06.206
Well, in that
we have the ability

15:06.239 --> 15:07.941
to create something
out of nothing,

15:07.975 --> 15:10.377
and that can be threatening
to people on the business side

15:10.410 --> 15:12.479
because...
they can't.

15:12.512 --> 15:16.049
Well, in my experience --
and, granted,

15:16.083 --> 15:17.550
I'm not the one
up there onstage

15:17.584 --> 15:21.321
at the Menlo Internet
Strategy Conference...

15:21.354 --> 15:22.722
[Laughs]

15:22.755 --> 15:24.491
...but in my experience,
someone on the business side

15:24.524 --> 15:28.095
could help shepherd a project
that's meandering or...

15:28.128 --> 15:29.496
headed off a cliff.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.398
Could be an ally,
no?

15:31.431 --> 15:34.534
Seems like that relationship
should be symbiotic.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.969
[Man coughs]

15:37.037 --> 15:38.972
I would say
it's parasitic.

15:39.006 --> 15:42.209
There's little regard
for the wellbeing of the host

15:42.242 --> 15:45.078
because a parasite
can always scuttle away,

15:45.112 --> 15:46.980
on to
the next warm body.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.182
[Audience murmuring]

15:49.216 --> 15:51.184
**

15:51.218 --> 15:53.320
[Clears throat]
Ok-Okay.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.455
I think that does it. We are,
uh -- We're out of time.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.723
Thank you all
for coming.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.491
Thank you
for your questions,

15:58.525 --> 16:00.193
and I hope we get a chance
to meet some of you outside.

16:00.227 --> 16:05.298
[Applause]

16:05.332 --> 16:09.569
**

16:14.541 --> 16:15.342
Well, yes,
I'm going to make the monthly.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.279
I-I'm at the mercy
of the pay schedule here.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.713
It's a consultant position.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.750
Tanya:
How was --
Donna: Fine.
It was fine.

16:23.783 --> 16:26.253
Yes.
Do we have
an update?

16:26.286 --> 16:28.621
The algorithm is continuing
to pick up new pages.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.490
It's effectively
charting the web.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.059
Okay.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.760
We're only searching URLs
and page headings but --

16:33.793 --> 16:36.163
Why can't we search
the body of the page?

16:36.196 --> 16:38.065
Elliot: That's the
ultimate goal, of course.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.532
We're just
not quite there yet.
It's too much data.

16:39.566 --> 16:40.767
W-With --
With current bandwidth,

16:40.800 --> 16:42.402
everything just
grinds to a halt.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.105
How effectively
can we search titles?

16:45.138 --> 16:46.739
Vera:
Very effectively,

16:46.773 --> 16:48.775
but the title
doesn't always correspond

16:48.808 --> 16:50.643
with, um,
what's on the site,

16:50.677 --> 16:52.645
so the results are...

16:52.679 --> 16:55.648
You keep giving me bad news
with a smile on your face.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.417
Do you know
that you're doing that?

16:57.450 --> 16:59.519
[Scoffs]

16:59.552 --> 17:01.788
You guys are invested
in this, right?

17:01.821 --> 17:04.691
Well, they have been
up all night working on it.

17:04.724 --> 17:08.195
And what do you have
to show for it?

17:14.234 --> 17:17.504
Let's search
"president."

17:17.537 --> 17:20.707
[Keyboard clacking]

17:21.774 --> 17:23.343
No Clinton.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.677
Well --

17:24.711 --> 17:27.380
What I see
are generic president results.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.516
My guess is that somewhere
buried among them

17:29.549 --> 17:32.485
are results about the current
leader of the free world,

17:32.519 --> 17:35.088
which is what I assume
people are looking for

17:35.122 --> 17:36.756
when they type in
"president."

17:36.789 --> 17:41.528
What we need is a sophisticated
rules engine in place.

17:41.561 --> 17:45.298
What I see is
no rules engine at all.

17:45.332 --> 17:49.169
You do know I used to be
an engineer, right?

17:49.202 --> 17:52.572
They don't know
what's expected of them

17:52.605 --> 17:54.307
unless you tell them.

17:54.341 --> 17:57.310
I am counting on you
to make it clear

17:57.344 --> 17:59.812
just how little time they have
to get this right.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.315
Okay?

18:02.349 --> 18:04.717
Okay.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.254
[Door slams]

18:07.287 --> 18:08.588
[Mouse clicks]

18:10.257 --> 18:11.724
Oh, yeah.
Cool.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.161
Okay. Pull it up,
let's take a look.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.362
[Door closes]

18:15.395 --> 18:17.197
I changed
the header.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.232
Oh, yeah. I like that.
It's Comet.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.433
It sounds like vomit.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.734
Don't listen
to her.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.371
It conveys speed,
a sense of wonder.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.539
What is this?
It's --
Joe and Haley

18:26.573 --> 18:28.708
are working on
Haley's website project.

18:28.741 --> 18:31.211
It's replacing
my independent-study credit.
[Refrigerator door closes]

18:31.244 --> 18:33.580
What? She gets
to miss school for this?

18:33.613 --> 18:34.881
I want
to miss school.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.283
You do miss school,

18:36.316 --> 18:37.550
you just don't
tell anyone about it.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.386
Hardy-har-har.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.887
Hey, you know,
I think it would be helpful

18:40.920 --> 18:43.723
if, like, we started out
with a bunch of categories,

18:43.756 --> 18:45.325
and then --

18:45.358 --> 18:46.826
But we don't want to make it
seem dry, you know?

18:46.859 --> 18:48.261
We don't want
to make it feel like

18:48.295 --> 18:50.230
anyone could have
organized this.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.865
Right.
Yeah, it's a dumb idea.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.634
No, no, what's so great
about what you've done

18:54.667 --> 18:56.269
is its
personal touch,

18:56.303 --> 18:58.905
the feeling that there is
a person on the other side,

18:58.938 --> 19:01.274
creating this experience
for you.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.376
Haley: Yeah.
That's what I meant...
Mom know about this?

19:03.410 --> 19:05.578
No, she does not yet,
but I will be the one

19:05.612 --> 19:08.381
to give her that information,
thank you very much.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.649
...like education
or something.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.218
Can I watch?
[Chuckles]

19:11.251 --> 19:12.552
...like
informational sites...

19:12.585 --> 19:13.920
Why don't we go,
uh,

19:13.953 --> 19:15.722
caving in upstate New York,
you know, spelunking?

19:15.755 --> 19:18.291
You're literally
shouting nonsense.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.460
I got all this stuff,
you know,

19:20.493 --> 19:21.861
and -- and I've
got time now.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.863
We should go
on an adventure.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.832
I don't want
to go to a cave.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.234
Well, look,
Haley...

19:27.267 --> 19:28.435
Um...

19:28.468 --> 19:29.902
...spelunking?

19:29.936 --> 19:31.404
You remember that project
you did about stalactites?

19:31.438 --> 19:36.576
I'm cool with
whatever you want, Dad.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.745
Oh,
that T-shirt.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.280
That's wild,

19:40.313 --> 19:41.781
I was listening to Ritual
on the way over here.

19:41.814 --> 19:42.982
Mm.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.651
Please don't try.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.753
Wh-What about fly-fishing
in Jackson Hole?

a new link to put in our index.

It's, um,
Smuth-ut.

19:51.858 --> 19:55.662
You know, Joanie, we could
actually use your input here.

19:55.695 --> 20:01.334
What would make a website seem,
you know, cool to you?

20:01.368 --> 20:02.569
Well,
I think it's pretty cool

20:02.602 --> 20:03.970

Home Videos"

20:04.003 --> 20:05.572

Sorry.
I'm taking it down!

I'm sorry.

His summer
vacation plans.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.599
Oh, well,
that must have been riveting.

I don't want
to talk about Trip anymore.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.305
Okay.

21:12.339 --> 21:14.874
He is an asset and a partner
in this firm, Donna.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.943
Yeah,
I understand that.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.912
I guess I was just
trying to make sure

21:19.946 --> 21:21.681
that someone
had my back.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.416
You know this office
is a boys' club.

It is a boys' club,

without anyone holding my hand.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.723
Does he have an advantage?
Of course he does.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.492
But that has nothing to do
with you.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.927
Your success here
is based on results,

21:34.961 --> 21:38.030
and I don't think you kicking
the crap out of your team

21:38.064 --> 21:39.632
is the way
to get 'em.

21:39.666 --> 21:40.933
I came in here
to tell you

21:40.967 --> 21:43.436
that your girl
from the Rover team --

21:43.470 --> 21:45.538
she was crying
in the stairwell just now.

a lighter touch.

how this happened,

in its current form

isn't a viable strategy
at this point.

will be dealt with.

And we should spread awareness
on the message boards.

worth a look down the road.

the president problem...

with a fix.

A temporary solution.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.949
Uh, Vera implemented
basic inference rules

30:16.983 --> 30:18.450
that complement
the Boolean logic,

30:18.484 --> 30:21.253
so when you type "president"
without "Clinton,"

30:21.287 --> 30:22.989
you get
relevant results.

"Rock" will give you
climbing and music,

Parmesan.

our first computer,

that my boss would find out.

32:25.211 --> 32:27.079

completely fooled,

and then one day, he leans over
to me very casually,

32:41.127 --> 32:42.494
and he says,

"Before you know it,

41:35.226 --> 41:36.662
The finished product --

41:36.695 --> 41:38.964
I'm just curious
how you're seeing that.

41:38.997 --> 41:42.067
It's the first site you visit
every time you're online.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.235
It's the page that gets you
where you wanna go --

41:44.269 --> 41:46.905
[Whispering indistinctly]
I'm sorry,
is there a problem?

41:46.938 --> 41:50.642
No, sorry, I just wanted
to flag something for you,

41:50.676 --> 41:52.310
but we can circle back
to that later.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.045
I'll swing by
your office.

41:54.079 --> 41:57.215
Oh, no. If you have something
to share, be my guest.

41:58.884 --> 42:01.653
Benji sent me
a link to a site

42:01.687 --> 42:03.822
that feels like
it might be operating

42:03.855 --> 42:05.090
in a similar space.

42:05.123 --> 42:07.626
Just wanted
to make sure you were aware.

42:07.659 --> 42:10.295
Benji, do me a favor
and see who's behind Comet.

42:10.328 --> 42:11.863
Maybe there's a play
to be made there.

42:11.897 --> 42:13.098
Benji: Sure.

42:18.604 --> 42:20.238
[Indistinct conversations]

42:20.271 --> 42:21.707
Thank you so much.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.609
Oh, no.
I can get that.

42:23.642 --> 42:25.043
Okay.

42:25.076 --> 42:26.612
Uh, I actually
had one thing

42:26.645 --> 42:27.813
I wanted to talk to you about
real quick.

42:27.846 --> 42:29.014
Oh, good.

42:29.047 --> 42:31.182
Uh, me, too,
but you go first.

42:31.216 --> 42:34.953
Someone at work showed me
the comet list or Comet?

42:34.986 --> 42:37.255
Yeah. Yeah.
What do you think?

42:37.288 --> 42:38.990
It's good.
Yeah?

42:39.024 --> 42:41.292
It's really good,
I just --

42:41.326 --> 42:44.763
we have something,
a play that looks like

42:44.796 --> 42:46.732
it could be part
of the competitive landscape,

42:46.765 --> 42:49.267
and I wanted to make sure
you knew.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.937
Part of
the competitive landscape?

42:51.970 --> 42:53.705
It's a search algorithm,

42:53.739 --> 42:56.775
basically indexing the web,
making it searchable.

42:56.808 --> 42:59.344
It started
as a medical indexing software,

42:59.377 --> 43:01.079
and they shifted
into web.

43:01.112 --> 43:04.049
Oh.
They shifted.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.651
When?

43:05.684 --> 43:06.918
A little while ago.

43:06.952 --> 43:08.219
Mm.

43:08.253 --> 43:09.888
Look, it's the idea
the team came to.

43:09.921 --> 43:11.857
I wanted to tell you
as a courtesy.

43:11.890 --> 43:13.959
Well, why didn't you tell me
as a courtesy

43:13.992 --> 43:16.628
when I mentioned our
indexing project the first time?

43:16.662 --> 43:19.364
Well, you told me that Joe
was writing down websites.

43:19.397 --> 43:21.933
You didn't tell me you were
building a company out of it.

43:21.967 --> 43:23.234
So you're competing
with us?

43:23.268 --> 43:24.970
Well,
we don't have to be.

43:25.003 --> 43:27.906
I'm sure I can talk the partners
into buying you out.

43:27.939 --> 43:29.240
Buy us?

43:29.274 --> 43:31.342
Why don't we buy you?

43:31.376 --> 43:33.378
Oh, well, Gordon,
you can't compete with us.

43:33.411 --> 43:35.814
You're not capitalized
the way we are.

43:35.847 --> 43:38.316
You don't have
the staying power, believe me.

43:38.349 --> 43:40.318
It's Haley's website.

43:40.351 --> 43:43.254
Uh, wait.
What?

43:43.288 --> 43:46.091
Haley's Comet --
she made the thing.

43:46.124 --> 43:48.126
We're building it
together.

43:49.795 --> 43:52.230
When were you gonna
tell me this?

43:52.263 --> 43:55.300
Right now.
Oh,
over second dessert?

43:55.333 --> 43:56.768
Oh, yeah,
like you weren't holding out

43:56.802 --> 43:58.369
on the news
that you stole our idea.

43:58.403 --> 44:00.205
Oh, please,
I didn't steal anything.

44:00.238 --> 44:02.407
You know everyone's
getting into this right now.

44:02.440 --> 44:05.110
You can't keep things from me
about our daughter.

44:05.143 --> 44:07.212
This just happened.

44:07.245 --> 44:09.180
It just happened.

44:09.214 --> 44:11.116
I'm telling you now. That's what
these dinners are for.

44:11.149 --> 44:13.018
You want to have dinner with me
every night?

44:13.051 --> 44:15.053
Well, no, not really.
I tried that for 15 years,

44:15.086 --> 44:16.788
didn't exactly get all
the information then, either.

44:16.822 --> 44:18.323
Oh, God. Yeah, we're really
playin' all the hits, aren't we?

44:18.356 --> 44:20.425
This is not the kind of decision
you get to make on your own.

44:20.458 --> 44:23.795
Listen to me --
Haley built it, okay?

44:23.829 --> 44:25.797
And we're helping her
make it into something more,

44:25.831 --> 44:27.198
and she loves it,
okay?

44:27.232 --> 44:28.967
You want to crush that,
go ahead.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.736
But when you
break the news to her,

44:30.769 --> 44:32.270
make sure you to tell her why --
that Mommy's knock-off company

44:32.303 --> 44:33.939
couldn't compete
with the one that she built.

44:33.972 --> 44:36.441
Gordon, this is a bad idea,
I'm telling you.

44:36.474 --> 44:38.476
Rover has the full weight
of the firm behind it,

44:38.509 --> 44:39.978
it's got momentum,

44:40.011 --> 44:42.113
and I couldn't stop it now
if I tried.

44:42.147 --> 44:44.015
Listen.
We're building the site.

44:44.049 --> 44:46.017
You do
whatever you think is right.
