00:02.544 --> 00:05.255
- Previously, on
"The Real Housewives
of Atlanta"...

00:05.296 --> 00:07.007
- Are you serious?

00:07.048 --> 00:08.008
My heart is beating
so fast.

00:08.049 --> 00:09.884
I just got so hot,
right now.

00:09.926 --> 00:12.012
Let's kill it.
Let's do it.

00:12.053 --> 00:14.848
* I'm gonna love me *

00:14.889 --> 00:16.766
* I'm gonna love me *

00:16.808 --> 00:18.435
- Yeah!

00:18.476 --> 00:20.311
- You couldn't make
Heath's party.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.855
- So, did you
come with a boo?

00:21.896 --> 00:23.023
- I had a companion.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.524
Monyetta is best friends

00:24.566 --> 00:28.820
with this super bachelor
named Roi.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.405
- Is being my assistant
harder than you thought?

00:30.447 --> 00:32.157
- You always
trying somethin'.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.825
- You don't respect
boundaries.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.204
- We can't.
- We're not talking about that.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.664
- 'Cause it's
a legal situation.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.249
- We don't know when we go
to Old Lady Gang

00:41.291 --> 00:43.960
if we're going to get
biscuits or bullets.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.420
- There was, like,
an incident.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.047
- You talking about the shooting
that happened at Blaze?

00:47.088 --> 00:48.590
Drew was tryin' to act
like she lost people

00:48.631 --> 00:49.674
to gun violence,

00:49.716 --> 00:50.925
and she can't say
the word "shooting."

00:50.967 --> 00:52.635
Why didn't you say,
"Shooting?"

00:52.677 --> 00:55.972
But I lost someone
who was close to me, as well.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.391
- Girl--
- My nephew is dead, bitch!

00:58.433 --> 00:59.726
(BLEEP)!

01:02.687 --> 01:05.440
- My roots are in Atlanta,
but my branches are worldwide.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.570
- Forget the gaslight,
I'm taking the spotlight.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.866
- My past may be checkered...

01:14.908 --> 01:15.617
But my future is solid gold.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.622
- I just don't do it
for the culture.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.665
Honey, I am the culture.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.084
- She by Sheree.

01:24.125 --> 01:27.253
More like
She broke the internet.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.255
- If you can't keep the pace,

01:29.297 --> 01:31.591
stay out of my race.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.685
* I am beautiful
I am beautiful *

01:41.726 --> 01:44.604
* So few say it *

01:44.646 --> 01:46.690
* Challenging my old views
I am beautiful *

01:46.731 --> 01:47.982
- I'm gonna have a cape.

01:48.024 --> 01:50.193
And then... Mmmm...
- Yeah.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.570
[humming]

01:52.612 --> 01:55.156
- That, and then, no,
go down first.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.449
- You know how
the-the dancers

01:56.491 --> 01:58.535
on the HBCUs, girl, the band.
- Yeah.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.495
- They come out.
They're flipping.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.871
- Everything, the hair.
- They're-- the hair

02:01.913 --> 02:03.873
is going everywhere.
They're givin' you legs. Yeah.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.667
- I think you just need to
go ahead and do it.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.461
I'll follow you.
This is your Magic Classic.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.921
- Monyetta and I
are rehearsing today

02:09.963 --> 02:13.174
because I will be performing
during the halftime show

02:13.216 --> 02:16.052
during the Magic City Classic
football game

02:16.094 --> 02:18.847
sponsored by
Kenya Moore Hair Care--

02:18.888 --> 02:21.182
* Kenya Moore Hair Care *

02:21.224 --> 02:22.642
Damn, we gotta practice
with the band, though.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.686
It's gonna be odd not to.
- It's gonna be so hard.

02:24.728 --> 02:27.480
Yeah, they have no time
when I was talk--

02:27.522 --> 02:29.315
oh, you got your water.
- They gotta have some time.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.608
- Gonna have to
figure it out.

02:30.650 --> 02:31.943
- Wherever I go,

02:31.985 --> 02:36.448
people love the Kenya Moore
Hair Care drumline,

02:36.489 --> 02:37.949
so I had
this brilliant idea

02:37.991 --> 02:41.286
to do a collaboration
with the University's band.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.913
So, it's sold out.
- Yeah. I'm so excited for you.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.457
- They will play our song,

02:45.498 --> 02:47.459
and I will dance
with the dance team.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.919
This could be
the viral moment

02:49.961 --> 02:53.340
that will send Kenya Moore
Hair Care over the edge.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.717
I'm a little nervous
because for BravoCon,

02:55.759 --> 02:58.136
when I came out,
that was a nightmare.

02:58.178 --> 03:02.349
* You say I'm old
I say I'm fabulous *

03:02.390 --> 03:04.184
All I know is, I was like,
"Oh, I'm on the floor.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.727
"I must've dropped."

03:05.769 --> 03:09.439
I was trying to give
legendary ball,

03:09.481 --> 03:12.776
but instead I gave you
rookie at the Apollo.

03:15.278 --> 03:19.074
[laughing]
I didn't nail it.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.076
So, for the costume--
- Purple or--

03:21.117 --> 03:22.994
- I think just
white and purple.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.204
- Yeah.
- And then just glitter,

03:24.245 --> 03:26.790
maybe some fringe,

03:26.831 --> 03:28.375
you know, so when
you're doin' all this,

03:28.416 --> 03:29.751
you can really, like--
- Mm-hmm.

03:29.793 --> 03:30.794
Everything with the hands--
you gotta have fringe.

03:30.835 --> 03:32.128
- Yeah, everything
with the hands.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.381
Monyetta is an amazing
choreographer.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.549
- I used to have
a dance troupe.

03:36.591 --> 03:40.470
Opened up for various artists.
Ginuwine, Joe...

03:40.512 --> 03:42.681
I danced on the stage
with Prince. Rest in peace.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.724
- So, I think
that using her

03:44.766 --> 03:47.519
will just definitely bring out
the best dancer in me.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.312
[phone ringing]
I gotta figure out all that.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.355
So, the--
- Hold on.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.941
- Wait, who?
- Well, hello!

03:52.982 --> 03:54.234
Look who this is.
- Uh-uh.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.945
[laughing]

03:58.697 --> 04:01.408
- It's gettin' pretty sexy
over here.

04:01.449 --> 04:03.910
There's a lot of hip rolls
and hair tossing.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.537
[laughing]

04:05.578 --> 04:07.539
You look sexy.
You make me miss you.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.415
- Hold the phone,
hold the phone.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.958
- No, stop.
[laughing]

04:13.461 --> 04:14.838
- The reviews
came back positive.

04:14.879 --> 04:17.048
Yelp was 9.6.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.758
He's actually very good
in bed.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.301
Your screen is dirty.
Hold on one second.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.970
- Oh, gosh, of course,
clean it.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.930
- Yes.
- All up in the sweat.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.852
- Okay, this is getting
X-rated.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.228
At the time that we met,

04:30.270 --> 04:32.272
I was still going through
a divorce.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.607
I've been separated
since 2019,

04:34.649 --> 04:37.485
waiting years for a divorce.
I'm not waiting anymore.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.696
Marc just won't
sign the divorce papers

04:39.738 --> 04:43.616
and walk away,
but I need to move on.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.702
Could that partner be Roi?

04:45.744 --> 04:47.871
He definitely has
my attention.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.291
- We'll talk to you later.
- Bye.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.710
- Bye, ladies.
- Bye.

04:53.752 --> 04:54.919
- I just love y'all together,
though, you know, but--

04:54.961 --> 04:58.298
- I know.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.175
Girl, I'm just happy
to be here

05:00.216 --> 05:01.468
and just get
a little breather.

05:01.509 --> 05:02.719
- Oh, girl.
- I mean, last night,

05:02.761 --> 05:04.929
they-they almost, like,
had me suffocating.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.891
I'm like, do I wanna bring
these heifers down there?

05:07.932 --> 05:09.100
- Where are we going?

05:09.142 --> 05:12.479
- Magic City Classic
that's in Birmingham,

05:12.520 --> 05:14.856
HBCU.
So, I'm doing some stuff.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.316
- Are you-- why are you
gonna be there?

05:16.358 --> 05:17.859
- To do, like,
the homecoming stuff,

05:17.901 --> 05:19.027
like being on the parade
and stuff like that.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.820
- Are you gonna dance?
- Oh, that's dope.

05:20.862 --> 05:21.738
- Yeah.

05:21.780 --> 05:24.324
The halftime show
is a secret,

05:24.366 --> 05:25.658
so I don't want to tell
the girls.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.868
- Wow.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.162
- I gagged them
the first time I showed up

05:29.204 --> 05:30.955
with my marching band.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.916
* Kenya Moore Hair Care *

05:32.957 --> 05:34.501
- What the hell is this?

05:34.542 --> 05:36.503
- And now,
I get to gag them again

05:36.544 --> 05:38.588
with another marching band.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.382
Who doesn't love
surprises?

05:40.423 --> 05:44.594
- Let's get to it.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.680
Kenya Moore Hair Care!

05:46.721 --> 05:52.644
**

05:52.686 --> 05:54.437
- I know I have that
podcast today.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.773
- Oh, at 4 o'clock,
and you have nails at 3.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.566
- Nails at 3,
podcast at 4.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.651
Let me just call Rizz
real quick

05:59.693 --> 06:02.696
'cause he's been running
around crazy.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.156
[phone ringing]
Rizzy-Rizz.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.199
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.034
How is it going?
- Okay.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.869
- I know that you're out
doing some returns and stuff,

06:09.911 --> 06:11.371
so are you almost
done with that?

06:11.413 --> 06:12.914
- I got one more stop.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.290
- Okay, perfect.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.875
We gotta send off
the additional two pieces

06:15.917 --> 06:18.169
that Bambini needed
to send for Deucey.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.295
- Okay.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.714
- We also have
some content stuff

06:20.755 --> 06:22.674
that I need to get done
for NBC.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.050
When you get back,
we gotta send them

06:24.092 --> 06:25.301
the new updated schedule,

06:25.343 --> 06:26.845
so we can get hair
and makeup completed.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.305
My brother-in-law
is now my assistant,

06:29.347 --> 06:31.683
which is a tougher job
than I thought

06:31.725 --> 06:34.102
because there's always
blurred lines

06:34.144 --> 06:35.729
between family and work.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.731
For Tyrell, some of the things
that he has to do

06:37.772 --> 06:39.899
might make him a little bit
uncomfortable,

06:39.941 --> 06:42.068
but who are they
gonna complain to?

06:42.110 --> 06:43.903
I am HR.
[laughing]

06:43.945 --> 06:45.071
I'm seeing a whole lot
of sh-- on here

06:45.113 --> 06:46.531
with no checkmarks,

06:46.573 --> 06:48.950
so we still got a lot to do.
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.494
- All right, bye.
- All right, bye.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.288
- Mommy Nation brunch
is up next.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.789
- Oh, yeah. Oh, God.

06:54.831 --> 06:58.168
So, aside from Mommy Nation,
I am an NBC sports analyst

06:58.209 --> 06:59.627
covering track meets.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.880
You might have seen me
on the Kentucky Derby.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.591
So, I have a lot of things
going on.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.092
I want our family
to see it through.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.219
I want us to do what we said
we were gonna do together

07:08.261 --> 07:09.763
before we all branch off,
again.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.640
Shez, I wanted to tell you
that Ross was saying,

07:12.682 --> 07:16.102
like, you know, he's ready
for us to just be us, again.

07:16.144 --> 07:19.898
- Oh.
- Just the Rosses.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.484
- I'm ready to-to have
a Ross house.

07:24.319 --> 07:25.820
- So, he's like,
"We said a year."

07:25.862 --> 07:27.906
- Wasn't it a year or two?

07:27.947 --> 07:29.866
- I always thought it was
a year or two.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.786
- But things could just
never be the same.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.079
- No, but you didn't hear
what I said, though.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.748
- Ross is ready for y'all
to be just y'all, again.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.500
- Yeah, but he said
it has nothing to do

07:38.541 --> 07:39.793
with you guys.

07:39.834 --> 07:44.005
- Us all living together
allows Sanya and Ross

07:44.047 --> 07:46.466
to move pretty freely

07:46.508 --> 07:48.635
and not have to worry
about Deuce.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.261
She's not selfish.
She's self-centered.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.596
- Yeah, I agree.
- Well said.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.473
[laughing]

07:53.515 --> 07:56.476
- Let me rally up
my troops

07:56.518 --> 07:57.894
and get on outta here, girl.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.354
- Please. No, Shez, listen.
- Listen.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.939
- I-I want y'all to stay.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.399
- It's not--
don't take it personal.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.983
It's not--

08:04.025 --> 08:05.610
- Chile, I don't want it
to hurt your feelings.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.821
- Good for y'all.
- Oh, no.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.580
* Every American dream *

08:17.622 --> 08:20.250
* running into danger
with a head full of steam *

08:20.291 --> 08:23.086
* the best to ever do it
yes we reign supreme *

08:23.128 --> 08:24.713
* My team *

08:26.715 --> 08:29.551
- Oh, Michael.
[laughing]

08:29.592 --> 08:31.511
My nephew is gonna need
blood on his face.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.013
He's a vampire.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.265
My little sister
is coming by, too.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.850
Now, how is she late?

08:36.891 --> 08:38.059
Oh, you know what,
Michael?

08:38.101 --> 08:39.269
Auntie Crystal can be
your makeup artist.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.688
[laughing]
- Hey.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.774
- Oh, Crystal! We were
just talking about you,

08:44.816 --> 08:46.067
and you walked in.
- What'd she say?

08:46.109 --> 08:48.278
- I told 'em you can put
the blood on his face,

08:48.319 --> 08:49.487
the fake blood.
Crystal, now you know you--

08:49.529 --> 08:50.864
- Yeah, I'll do it for you.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.198
- Go on and get it,
Michael.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.243
Today, I'm doing my annual
Halloween shoot

08:55.285 --> 08:56.369
with Michael and William.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.787
Since Sharon
has been around,

08:57.829 --> 09:01.416
it feels amazing to build
new traditions with family,

09:01.458 --> 09:02.667
and at Mauntie Marlo's,

09:02.709 --> 09:04.669
there always something
to celebrate.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.004
Oh, so, I have good news.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.965
Over 20-something years ago,
I got in trouble,

09:09.007 --> 09:12.052
and, you know, my rights
to, uh, bear arms were taken.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.596
So, what I'm trying to do now,
is get it expunged.

09:14.637 --> 09:15.847
Since the break-in
and everything

09:15.889 --> 09:17.515
that happened at the house,

09:17.557 --> 09:20.060
I don't feel safe
without having a gun.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.770
I need to get
my record expunged

09:21.811 --> 09:24.230
because that's an old chapter
in my life.

09:24.272 --> 09:27.442
I'm so tired of these ladies
always using my past against me,

09:27.484 --> 09:29.319
you convict, you felon,

09:29.361 --> 09:30.695
and how I don't sleep
at night

09:30.737 --> 09:33.740
due to four armed gunmen
kicking my door in,

09:33.782 --> 09:36.076
and I just wanna be able
to protect the boys and myself.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.328
I just met this young lady
named Courtney.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.163
She's like, "Oh, hold on.
I'm gonna give you the number.

09:40.205 --> 09:40.955
I'm gonna call the guy."

09:49.964 --> 09:51.716
- That's good.
- I'm so excited.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.385
So, say a prayer.
- You need one.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.511
- I want you to meet her,
as well.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.845
She's supposed
to come by today.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.555
Just her vibe
and her energy,

09:57.597 --> 09:59.516
like I always tell you,
get good friends.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.059
I've been with this group
of girls, Kandi,

10:01.101 --> 10:03.269
who says she's worldwide,
and she helps the world.

10:03.311 --> 10:06.648
You've never helped me
get my charges expunged.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.235
- Oh, my God!
I'm looking like, wait.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.611
You whisper like a ghost.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.238
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi, baby.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.656
This is Courtney.
I just said your name.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.116
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. How are you?

10:16.157 --> 10:17.701
- This is my little
sister, Crystal.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.743
- Courtney-- nice to meet you.
- I was just bragging about you.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.245
- Were you?
What were you saying?

10:20.286 --> 10:21.621
- Courtney, you have no idea,
and even though I told you

10:21.663 --> 10:24.290
thank you the other night,
it means the world to me,

10:24.332 --> 10:25.709
seriously.
- Aww.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.752
- For you to just say,
"Hey, I know some people,

10:27.794 --> 10:29.337
and I'm gonna try and see
if they can help you."

10:29.379 --> 10:31.006
I'm just so thankful.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.591
- I can be
a real life Olivia Pope

10:33.633 --> 10:35.552
as a crisis manager.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.804
Everyone deserves
a fresh start.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.807
Marlo made a mistake
20 years ago,

10:40.849 --> 10:43.476
and if there's anything
I can do to help her,

10:43.518 --> 10:44.811
I certainly will.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.646
- So, I'm just getting
into telling my sister

10:46.688 --> 10:47.647
about everything.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.024
- Oh.
- I was gonna--

10:49.065 --> 10:50.400
girl, we have not seen
each other since that night.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.402
- A lot that happened
that night, too, sister.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.195
- Why didn't you say,
"Shoot?"

10:54.237 --> 10:56.072
We are a family.
- It was on the news.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.992
Girl--
- My nephew is dead, bitch!

10:59.034 --> 11:01.077
The shooting and Kandi's
restaurant, Old Lady Gang,

11:01.119 --> 11:02.120
is hitting home.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.621
My nephew was shot
by someone he met

11:03.663 --> 11:04.789
at Old Lady Gang, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

11:04.831 --> 11:05.957
- And that was his roommate.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.500
- Yeah, with Quentin.
- Yes.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.793
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.171
- When we had Quentin's
funeral, I text Kandi.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.548
I said, "Hey, do you know
Quentin St. Clair?"

11:13.590 --> 11:15.300
She says, "He don't work
there no more.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.843
Sorry to hear that."

11:16.885 --> 11:19.095
On his obituary,
he has on a chef outfit,

11:19.137 --> 11:20.638
and that's at Old Lady Gang,

11:20.680 --> 11:22.182
in the kitchen, cooking.
- Oh, wow.

11:22.223 --> 11:25.060
- Quentin was so excited he
was working for Old Lady Gang.

11:25.101 --> 11:28.396
So, at the funeral, to see
flowers were not delivered,

11:28.438 --> 11:31.358
not to send a card,
it's just bothered me

11:31.399 --> 11:32.859
for years since his passing,

11:32.901 --> 11:34.778
is that she never
acknowledged it.

11:34.819 --> 11:35.945
What would you have said?

11:35.987 --> 11:37.781
- I'm sorry.
What can I do?

11:37.822 --> 11:39.240
How can I help the family?

11:41.076 --> 11:42.369
- So, I'm like,
"Drew, I'm just saying

11:42.410 --> 11:43.578
hold her accountable,

11:43.620 --> 11:45.163
what's going on
at Old Lady Gang,

11:45.205 --> 11:46.247
what happened."

11:46.289 --> 11:48.208
Why does Kandi
keep having shootings?

11:58.593 --> 11:59.594
- Why does Kandi
keeping having shootings?

12:00.762 --> 12:02.347
No one is asking
questions.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.598
Maybe is it security?

12:03.640 --> 12:04.724
Maybe she needs to--

12:04.766 --> 12:06.226
- Maybe it's the culture
that she creates.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.811
I'm so sorry.
- So-so, that hit home.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.771
- The thing that's
sentimental, right now.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.898
- Sweetie, don't cry.
She was raised with him.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.109
- Oh, wow, I'm so sorry.
- When my mother had her,

12:14.150 --> 12:15.944
his mother went in and got her
from the hospital,

12:15.985 --> 12:17.445
so she grew up
with Quentin.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.156
My family is still sour with
the taste of Kandi's name.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.492
We just want her to
acknowledge Quentin's passing,

12:22.534 --> 12:24.911
and, damn it, I was
frustrated with my family

12:24.953 --> 12:26.830
bugging me about Kandi.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.666
Like, she doesn't care.
She's selfish to me.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.043
So, Kandi, we were trying
to ask her about the shooting.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.587
She's like, "Yeah, let's talk
about the girl you stabbed."

12:34.629 --> 12:35.964
- Twenty years ago, again.
- Yes.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.549
It's something I regret.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.300
- It's something you have
to live with every day.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.885
You get what I'm saying?
- Every day of my life,

12:40.927 --> 12:43.013
I'm waking up, I'm dreaming,
I'm hurt,

12:43.054 --> 12:45.682
and she passed years
after our incident.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.809
- Sounds like there's some
empathy missing there somehow.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.477
- It is.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.729
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.855
- That's horrible.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.231
- Well, we're gonna get
this look done

12:53.273 --> 12:54.858
real quick in this wig,
so you can at least see me

12:54.899 --> 12:56.109
with this outfit on.
- Yes, I need to see y'all.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.528
- I'm gonna get me some food.
- Yes. We ready?

12:58.570 --> 13:00.030
Let's hit it.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.036
* Nice black Porsche no
top leather seats *

13:06.077 --> 13:08.413
* put the pedal to the metal
vroom vroom beep beep *

13:11.416 --> 13:13.251
- Hello.
- How are you, Miss Whitfield?

13:13.293 --> 13:15.712
- How are you?
- Come on in.

13:15.754 --> 13:16.921
Just have a seat
in the chair.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.715
You don't need to get
undressed just yet.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.258
All righty.
I'm gonna go get her.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.719
She'll be right in.
Have a seat, okay?

13:22.761 --> 13:25.138
[knocking]
- Come in.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.223
- Good to see ya, honey.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.308
- You, too.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.560
- All right, so, tell me
why you're here.

13:30.602 --> 13:31.895
What's-what's concerning you?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.271
- Well, I still-- I wanna
talk about the fibroid.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.147
- Okay.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.607
- Cycle has been crazy.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.983
- Is it heavy at all?

13:37.025 --> 13:38.401
- Sometimes. Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.903
What about any pain?

13:39.944 --> 13:41.029
- Mm-hmm.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.072
I'm gettin' older.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.365
You know, you're thinking,
you know,

13:43.406 --> 13:44.866
with you're getting menopause,
and eventually,

13:44.908 --> 13:47.118
the bleeding should stop,
at some point,

13:47.160 --> 13:49.746
but these fibroids
are awful.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.373
There's excessive bleeding.

13:51.414 --> 13:54.918
It's ----ing up my love life
'cause have you seen my man?

13:54.959 --> 13:56.711
He does have
big dick energy.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.005
[moaning]

13:59.047 --> 14:01.675
- The good thing is that
there's so many options.

14:01.716 --> 14:03.218
Like, uh,
back in the days,

14:03.259 --> 14:05.887
they was snatching
everybody's stuff out, chile,

14:05.929 --> 14:08.640
but now we can
shrink them.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.392
If we're doin'
the shrinkage,

14:10.433 --> 14:11.810
you're back to work
in a week,

14:11.851 --> 14:13.812
back to exercise and sex
in, like, two to three weeks,

14:13.853 --> 14:14.896
just depending
on how you feel.

14:14.938 --> 14:15.855
- Oh, that's what I need,
right there.

14:15.897 --> 14:16.981
- Right.
I'm trying to tell you.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.817
- It goes from here to just--
- Yeah.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.652
We can remove
just the fibroids

14:20.694 --> 14:22.487
and then, of course,
yes, some women will choose

14:22.529 --> 14:24.155
to remove the fibroids
and the uterus

14:24.197 --> 14:26.908
'cause they don't want
that risk of it coming back.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.910
And it is very finite,

14:28.952 --> 14:31.037
and you need to sit down
somewhere for six weeks,

14:31.079 --> 14:32.455
so that's not always easy.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.499
- So, six weeks
no exercise, no sex.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.583
- Mm-hmm.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.918
- Yeah, I don't know
about that one.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.253
No sex? No exercise?

14:38.294 --> 14:40.005
Those are
my two favorite things.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.089
- I'm gonna put you
back first.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.924
- Boom, bam.
- Bam.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.217
- That's some angle,
right there.

14:44.259 --> 14:45.885
I need one of these chairs
at home.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.971
- Ooh, Lord.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.765
- What?
- You been trying?

14:50.807 --> 14:53.393
- Trying for what?
[laughing]

14:53.435 --> 14:54.978
- I'm just messing
wit' you.

14:55.020 --> 14:55.895
I ain't trying to give you
a heart attack.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.147
- Oh, Lord. Oh, my God.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.607
- You're like my blood pressure
already up.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.736
So, that's the uterus there.
Fibroid is back here.

15:02.777 --> 15:03.987
- What you see?

15:04.029 --> 15:06.614
- You have a couple of
lemon-size fibroids.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.199
- Mm-hmm.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.119
I don't really wanna
have a major surgery.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.537
I got so much going on.
I really need to,

15:12.579 --> 15:14.164
you know, really
focus on She by Sheree

15:14.205 --> 15:15.665
and growing the business.

15:15.707 --> 15:20.003
I don't really have time
to be down for eight weeks.

15:20.045 --> 15:22.505
I'm thinking I need to
explore more options.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.799
- Okay, baby, I'm gonna step out
and let you get dressed,

15:24.841 --> 15:26.009
and I'll get you
your Advil.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.386
[laughing]

15:28.428 --> 15:31.639
- Let me look at my stash.
[laughing]

15:31.681 --> 15:34.851
**

15:34.893 --> 15:37.187
* pow you got it
I want it *

15:37.228 --> 15:39.147
* I need it like now *

15:39.189 --> 15:40.565
* baby like *

15:40.607 --> 15:42.192
- Hey, so how are you?

15:42.233 --> 15:43.735
Sherie, I need you
to make me look like

15:43.777 --> 15:45.236
a princess today.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.531
So, Shez was supposed to
be here to do my hair,

15:48.573 --> 15:50.617
but she's not feeling
so hot today.

15:50.658 --> 15:51.951
- Oh, no.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.453
- But we did this,
so the crown could go on top.

15:53.495 --> 15:54.829
- Okay, cute.

15:54.871 --> 15:57.832
- My sister is sick.
Bullsh--.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.125
She might be sick of me,

15:59.167 --> 16:01.044
and I'm about sick
of her ass

16:01.086 --> 16:02.504
for not coming to
this photo shoot, too.

16:02.545 --> 16:03.797
So, I don't know
if it's just me

16:03.838 --> 16:05.173
or if you guys
feel the same way,

16:05.215 --> 16:06.466
but I feel like ever since
we had the conversation

16:06.508 --> 16:08.343
where, you know, Ross
is kinda ready for us

16:08.385 --> 16:10.178
to, like set, like,
a hard timeline,

16:10.220 --> 16:11.554
I feel like, since then,

16:11.596 --> 16:13.390
Shez has this big ol' reaction
to that everything,

16:13.431 --> 16:15.308
and, like, I-I-I don't know
if I didn't handle it

16:15.350 --> 16:18.061
with enough care
because Tyrell quit.

16:18.103 --> 16:20.522
- Say what?

16:20.563 --> 16:22.565
How comes he never
said anything to me?

16:22.607 --> 16:23.733
Did I do somethin'?

16:23.775 --> 16:26.111
- He did say that being
around me and you

16:26.152 --> 16:28.613
with this girl energy,
and, like, it's becoming

16:28.655 --> 16:31.241
too overwhelming with us
living together

16:31.282 --> 16:32.617
and working together.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.911
- I just noticed that he
wasn't responding to emails

16:34.953 --> 16:37.789
in a timely fashion anymore.

16:37.831 --> 16:41.126
- Tyrell quitting is tough
because I know my sister

16:41.167 --> 16:43.211
feels like he gets
taken advantage of.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.338
I thought him being
my assistant would be great,

16:45.380 --> 16:48.216
but now it's putting
a huge strain

16:48.258 --> 16:50.051
on my relationship,
not with him

16:50.093 --> 16:52.220
but with my sister.

16:52.262 --> 16:55.181
I've always felt,
as somebody who in the family

16:55.223 --> 16:57.142
is always so blessed,
I like, I always want

16:57.183 --> 16:59.436
to try to extent that
to everybody else.

16:59.477 --> 17:02.063
So, to me, it's like
I asked y'all to come here,

17:02.105 --> 17:03.398
to come to Atlanta,

17:03.440 --> 17:06.401
because I thought we could
really grow together,

17:06.443 --> 17:08.653
and I really wanted
to see us

17:08.695 --> 17:10.238
see that through.
- Growing that, yeah.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.240
Almost like you're
not appreciated.

17:12.282 --> 17:13.324
- I don't know where we go
from here.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.076
I just-- I think
I have a lot of, uh,

17:15.118 --> 17:16.578
feelings about the situation.

17:22.584 --> 17:25.045
- Dad, you can't
send a damn email.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.172
You can't add nothin'
to my calendar.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.215
I'm tired of working
with family, chile.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.676
- I feel like the same about you
as you feel about me.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.511
- Oh!

17:33.553 --> 17:36.222
[laughing]

17:36.264 --> 17:37.974
- Coming up...

17:38.016 --> 17:38.892
- Summer!
Summer gone, bitch!

17:46.483 --> 17:47.067
* All day we slay *

17:48.443 --> 17:51.029
* all day we slay
that's right *

17:51.071 --> 17:53.073
- Caitlyn,
can you come in here?

17:53.114 --> 17:54.324
Hurry up.
- Yes, ma'am.

17:54.366 --> 17:55.742
- We're going to Birmingham,

17:55.784 --> 17:57.410
and mommy is gonna be
in a parade.

17:57.452 --> 17:58.703
You're gonna come down,
and you're gonna be

17:58.745 --> 18:00.914
in the parade with
mommy, okay?

18:00.955 --> 18:03.041
Caitlyn, you come later.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.334
- Yes, ma'am.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.960
- Mommy is gonna be doing
things with her friends.

18:06.002 --> 18:09.047
And you also have to share
your location with me

18:09.089 --> 18:11.174
at all times.

18:11.216 --> 18:15.261
* Slay girl slay yeah *

18:15.303 --> 18:16.638
- Hi, girl.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.849
- Hey, girl, I'm over here
packing for Birmingham.

18:21.309 --> 18:22.394
- Oh, no, you're asking
the wrong person.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.770
I have no idea.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.108
- He has his kids
this weekend. So...

18:28.149 --> 18:29.567
* Where are all the girls *

18:29.609 --> 18:32.112
* where are all the girls at *

18:32.153 --> 18:34.614
* we run the world
we run it *

18:34.656 --> 18:36.908
- Hey, Sharon.
Too sexy, you think?

18:36.950 --> 18:39.119
- I don't know if you can be
too sexy with those ladies.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.620
- Ha!

18:40.662 --> 18:41.830
Let me go get
the rest of the stuff.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.207
- I could rock
some of these pieces.

18:44.249 --> 18:47.752
This is cute.
She would kill me.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.714
* Show up and slay girl slay *

18:50.755 --> 18:55.093
* yeah oh yeah
we don't play *

18:55.135 --> 18:56.469
* we just slay *

18:56.511 --> 18:59.764
- Can we be wheels up at 10:15?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.808
I don't want anyone
coming down my driveway.

19:01.850 --> 19:04.227
My driveway is vicious.
[laughing]

19:04.269 --> 19:05.687
- Ooh, hold on.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.188
This is a mother----ing
roller coaster, right here.

19:07.230 --> 19:10.483
- It's just easier and safer
to meet at Sheree's house,

19:10.525 --> 19:12.152
which is not even
a block away.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.778
[coughing]

19:13.820 --> 19:16.740
**

19:16.781 --> 19:20.326
- Well, hello. Hey.
- Hey.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.121
- How are you?
- Hey.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.914
- Hi.
Good morning, ladies.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.667
- We got a beautiful--

19:27.709 --> 19:30.128
**

19:30.170 --> 19:34.799
- Morning.
- Good morning.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.301
- Hey, Monyetta.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.552
Okay, we gotta go, guys.

19:37.594 --> 19:38.511
- I know Marlo is on her way,
right now.

19:38.553 --> 19:39.804
- We gotta go.

19:39.846 --> 19:40.722
- Where is Drew?

19:41.890 --> 19:43.516
- She texted you.
Y'all-- oh, that's right.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.685
You guys are cousins.
- We are.

19:45.727 --> 19:46.853
- How many cousins,
like second, third, fourth?

19:46.895 --> 19:48.605
- I don't know.
I don't know.

19:48.646 --> 19:49.981
- Well, you're claiming folks.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.734
You need to find out
how you were related to them.

19:52.776 --> 19:53.902
[laughing]

19:53.943 --> 19:59.074
- So, we're two men down,
Kandi and Drew.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.825
* Hey hey *

20:00.867 --> 20:02.035
[clears throat]

20:02.077 --> 20:04.245
- I have the flu,

20:04.287 --> 20:07.999
influenza type B to be exact.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.001
Too much sickness going around.
I got the kids.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.544
It's me. It's Ralph.
It's the nanny.

20:11.586 --> 20:13.380
It's like, yeah,
we just need a cleansing,

20:13.421 --> 20:15.965
at this point.
[coughing]

20:16.007 --> 20:17.258
- Door is closing.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.135
- Marlo is literally here,
Kenya.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.012
- Like I said, get on the bus.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.931
I don't like that
I'm hosting a trip,

20:22.972 --> 20:25.058
and two of my closest friends
aren't here.

20:25.100 --> 20:29.854
Kandi had a prior commitment to
the Ebony Power 100.

20:29.896 --> 20:30.855
Kandi is my girl.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.732
She's my right hand man,
right now,

20:32.774 --> 20:35.402
and the fact that
I don't have her on this trip,

20:35.443 --> 20:36.986
it feels kinda sad.

20:37.028 --> 20:38.738
- Oh, my bag is heavy.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.699
- We on the bus.
- We on the bus. Hey, hey.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.409
- We on the bus.
Get on up.

20:42.450 --> 20:44.577
- Let's go!
- Get on the bus.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.913
- Or we're leaving!
- Not yet.

20:46.955 --> 20:51.626
[cheering]

20:53.044 --> 20:56.881
- All aboard the express bus
to Birmingham.

20:56.923 --> 21:00.218
In first class,
I'm accompanied by Monyetta,

21:00.260 --> 21:01.970
Sheree, and Sanya.

21:02.012 --> 21:06.474
And in the luggage department,
is Courtney and mumbles Marlo.

21:06.516 --> 21:08.143
- What are we in for
in Alabama, chile?

21:08.184 --> 21:11.146
- It's homecoming weekend
and one of the biggest

21:11.187 --> 21:13.481
college games ever,
Alabama.

21:13.523 --> 21:16.401
[cheering]

21:16.443 --> 21:18.778
It's so much fun.
- It's gonna be so lit.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.947
- They actually asked me
to come and participate

21:20.989 --> 21:23.950
in the parade.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:23.992 --> 21:25.702
So, do you know what time
the game is tomorrow?

21:25.744 --> 21:27.454
- Around 3.
- Oh, perfect,

21:27.495 --> 21:28.872
'cause I do have to pop
out in the morning.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.582
I have an appearance with NBC.
I've been--

21:30.623 --> 21:31.791
it's been booked
for a long time.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.085
- Oh, yes, you have to go back.
- Yeah.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.629
Your girl is booked and busy,
but I made it a point

21:36.671 --> 21:38.131
to be here to
support Kenya.

21:38.173 --> 21:40.216
So, I'm gonna head back
to Atlanta in the morning,

21:40.258 --> 21:42.052
do a little reporting for NBC,

21:42.093 --> 21:44.137
and then get back
on the road to Alabama.

21:44.179 --> 21:45.972
That is being a good friend.
But I'll be back.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.098
I'll be back around 1:00.
- Okay.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.310
Anyway, we are going to
a dance class.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.311
You're gonna learn.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.520
- Right now, straightaway?
- Yes.

21:52.562 --> 21:53.563
- Oh.
- Yeah, because, you know,

21:53.605 --> 21:54.939
it's early,
so you know the hotels

21:54.981 --> 21:55.982
don't really let you check in
until, like, 3.

21:56.024 --> 21:56.900
- Like, check in.

21:56.941 --> 21:58.151
- So, we're gonna get a lesson?

21:58.193 --> 21:59.569
- You're gonna get a lesson,
so have some fun.

21:59.611 --> 22:00.987
- Okay.

22:01.029 --> 22:02.280
- So, then we're gonna
just grab something cute to eat.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.365
[coughing]

22:03.406 --> 22:06.201
Go back--
go back to the hotel.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.167
- Oh, it's a fundraiser.
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.543
- That's nice.

22:15.585 --> 22:16.920
- I'm excited about
the Magic City football game,

22:16.961 --> 22:19.839
but Kenya the stunt queen
is always up to somethin'.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.716
I'm a little worried about
what other surprises

22:21.758 --> 22:23.259
Kenya may have for us
this trip.

22:23.301 --> 22:25.845
- Oh, my God, I don't know
if I got any charity clothes.

22:25.887 --> 22:28.515
Leave it to Kenya
to surprise us with some sh--,

22:28.556 --> 22:29.641
but it's okay.

22:29.683 --> 22:31.351
I'm not worried about
the dress code.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.602
It's Birmingham.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.646
- Yeah, you can just wear
a cute dress.

22:34.688 --> 22:37.482
- I thought this was
girls trip in Alabama.

22:37.524 --> 22:41.945
I didn't know classy girls trip.
[coughing]

22:41.986 --> 22:43.363
- It feels like
we're at a hospital.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.323
[coughing]

22:45.365 --> 22:47.867
- I don't know what's worse--
getting coughed on by Kenya

22:47.909 --> 22:51.162
or sitting in front of Marlo
hacking on me.

22:51.204 --> 22:53.915
- I'm just gonna do this.

22:53.957 --> 22:56.084
- Now, it's a lot of
single men in Alabama,

22:56.126 --> 22:57.836
and they will--
are you single?

22:57.877 --> 22:58.837
- It's complicated.

22:58.878 --> 23:04.217
- Oh.
- Ohhh, sh--!

23:04.259 --> 23:05.635
- This weekend, I--
this weekend, I am, actually.

23:05.677 --> 23:06.553
- Oh, none of us have rings
on our fing--

23:06.594 --> 23:07.804
I mean, you know.

23:07.846 --> 23:09.639
- Quick question, girl talk--
did y'all see

23:09.681 --> 23:11.641
one of Future's baby mamas?

23:11.683 --> 23:12.726
She was like...

23:15.937 --> 23:17.272
- Wait.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.732
- It was good when I was what?
- Eating your booty.

23:18.773 --> 23:20.984
- I've never eaten a booty.
[laughing]

23:21.026 --> 23:23.153
- Sheree--
- So, have you eaten booty?

23:23.194 --> 23:25.655
- If my husband were to
toot his ass in my face--

23:25.697 --> 23:26.906
[laughing]

23:26.948 --> 23:28.908
- I wouldn't even know
what to do down there.

23:28.950 --> 23:30.493
Kenya, what did you do
when you did it?

23:30.535 --> 23:32.412
[screaming]

23:32.454 --> 23:33.913
- Wait, wait,
hold the phone!

23:33.955 --> 23:40.420
Hold the-- wait.
Kenya, you've done this before?

23:40.462 --> 23:42.047
- Coming up next...

23:42.088 --> 23:45.091
- Oh!

23:45.133 --> 23:46.634
[laughing]

23:54.309 --> 23:54.559
**

23:56.770 --> 23:58.188
- Kenya, what did you do
when you did it?

23:58.229 --> 24:00.023
[screaming]

24:00.065 --> 24:02.442
- Kenya,
you've done this before?

24:02.484 --> 24:06.071
- It was in my 20's.
- Miss USA was eating ass?

24:07.655 --> 24:09.824
- That's what I said!
[laughing]

24:09.866 --> 24:12.994
- Sheree,
that's between us girls.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.829
So, I was like, well,
if you didn't like the head,

24:14.871 --> 24:17.123
maybe you'll like the ass.
[laughing]

24:17.165 --> 24:20.877
- Toss my salad, bitch.
- A whole lotta mercy.

24:20.919 --> 24:23.588
I don't even want nobody
eating my booty.

24:23.630 --> 24:24.547
- I'm on the receiving end.

24:24.589 --> 24:26.007
I can--
I can receive.

24:28.718 --> 24:31.221
[laughing]

24:31.262 --> 24:33.973
- The Dance Foundation, okay.
- The Dance Foundation.

24:34.015 --> 24:37.852
- Thank you so much.
- Whoo-hoo!

24:37.894 --> 24:40.730
- Hey, ladies, what's up?
I'm Coach Nile.

24:40.772 --> 24:42.232
- All right.

24:42.273 --> 24:44.192
- I'll be teaching, um, today,
you guys, a bucking class.

24:44.234 --> 24:46.236
You guys are gonna get changed
and head to the studio.

24:46.277 --> 24:49.197
**

24:49.239 --> 24:50.907
So, we're gonna be doing
majorette today.

24:50.949 --> 24:53.868
Bucking is an aspect
or a part of majorette.

24:53.910 --> 24:56.287
A majorette is a style
that comes from different HBCUs,

24:56.329 --> 24:57.205
so different teams.

24:57.247 --> 24:58.707
Like Alabama A&M,
they may be

24:58.748 --> 25:01.626
a little bit more milky
while the JState is just, like,

25:01.668 --> 25:04.087
more bucking, more hard-hitting,
so we're gonna do both.

25:04.129 --> 25:06.131
So, you're gonna do four rolls.

25:06.172 --> 25:09.300
So, Marlo, I want booty,
more of your hips.

25:09.342 --> 25:10.802
Yes, exactly that.

25:10.844 --> 25:13.221
- Hey!
- Whoa!

25:13.263 --> 25:15.056
- I don't know how to buck.
I know how to drop.

25:15.098 --> 25:19.602
I know I got them good ol'
Megan Stallion knees.

25:19.644 --> 25:21.521
- Here we go.
And one.

25:21.563 --> 25:24.232
* So this about to bounce
bounce bounce bounce *

25:24.274 --> 25:29.154
Up, six, seven, eight, yes,
and then you do three.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.740
One, two, three.
Bow, bow, bow.

25:31.781 --> 25:33.241
- Bucking is a lot of fun.

25:33.283 --> 25:36.036
I mean, I don't think
I have all the assets

25:36.077 --> 25:38.913
that you need to make it work,
but little booties matter,

25:38.955 --> 25:40.457
and something is happening
back there.

25:40.498 --> 25:42.000
- That's a workout.

25:42.042 --> 25:44.836
- Now, you guys, I'm gonna
add on something to this.

25:44.878 --> 25:49.424
So, Monyetta and I
are going to judge a buck off.

25:49.466 --> 25:51.426
- What-what?

25:51.468 --> 25:54.554
- Okay, so, the winner
is going to receive a prize.

25:54.596 --> 25:57.432
So, guys, we're gonna give you
some minutes to rehearse.

25:57.474 --> 25:58.808
- Okay.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.018
- When we come back,
it's going to be the buck off.

26:00.060 --> 26:02.395
- Okay.
- Come on, ladies.

26:02.437 --> 26:05.148
- Look, I thought this was
supposed to be a group activity.

26:05.190 --> 26:07.359
Now, Kenya and her
emotional support companion,

26:07.400 --> 26:09.736
Monyetta, is running off.

26:09.778 --> 26:11.488
Something is going on here.

26:11.529 --> 26:12.697
- Let's do this.

26:12.739 --> 26:13.948
- You know we can't practice
a long time

26:13.990 --> 26:14.783
'cause then they're gonna--
- Of course, yes.

26:14.824 --> 26:15.909
- All right.
Here we go.

26:15.950 --> 26:19.704
This is one, two,
yes, three, to the left.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.831
- Wait, my shoe came loose.

26:21.873 --> 26:24.167
- Yes, twirl.
You better twirl, girl!

26:24.209 --> 26:27.796
- My upcoming halftime show,
it will be an arena

26:27.837 --> 26:32.300
with 15,000 people,
but it's also televised.

26:32.342 --> 26:36.262
So, I have to bring it,
or I will never live it down.

26:36.304 --> 26:39.557
- Eight, yes, one, two, three,

26:39.599 --> 26:43.603
four, five, six, yes.
[coughs]

26:43.645 --> 26:45.188
We are ready
for the buck down.

26:45.230 --> 26:46.648
- Where are the judges?
Judges!

26:46.690 --> 26:48.066
- We need the judges.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.318
- Ooh, hold on, okay, wait.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.945
- Can you please do
a low angle?

26:51.986 --> 26:54.114
- Like this?

26:54.155 --> 26:55.365
- Sheree, come on.
Let's look for them.

26:55.407 --> 26:56.533
I don't know.

26:56.574 --> 27:01.121
- Let me do it from this way.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.831
- Looks cute in the mirror.

27:02.872 --> 27:05.500
- Oh, look.
- Girl, look, oh, my God.

27:05.542 --> 27:08.336
- Just turn. Arch your back.
- What are y'all doing?

27:08.378 --> 27:09.796
[laughing]
- Y'all ready-ready?

27:09.838 --> 27:11.506
- We've been ready.
- Okay, let's go.

27:11.548 --> 27:12.841
- We gotta go back and practice.
- Practice, yes.

27:12.882 --> 27:15.343
[laughing]

27:15.385 --> 27:16.678
- This is gonna be
very interesting.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.054
- It really is.

27:18.096 --> 27:20.682
- Welcome to the first ever
Kenya Moore buck off.

27:20.724 --> 27:22.475
Ready?

27:22.517 --> 27:24.644
Let the show begin.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.730
* My style like
a million *

27:26.771 --> 27:29.232
* I shine so bright
to brilliant *

27:29.274 --> 27:31.401
[laughing]

27:31.443 --> 27:34.571
* Yeah I get all the likes
all the likes *

27:34.612 --> 27:36.406
* My style like
a million *

27:36.448 --> 27:38.783
* I shine so bright
too brilliant *

27:38.825 --> 27:41.327
- Oh!

27:41.369 --> 27:42.704
Shake it, shake it,
shake it!

27:42.746 --> 27:44.330
* All the likes
all the likes *

27:44.372 --> 27:46.207
[laughing]

27:52.464 --> 27:55.258
- Okay, I'm not sure if I would
call that dancing but...

27:55.300 --> 27:57.594
[laughing]
- HBCU, bitch.

28:01.556 --> 28:05.685
- Okay, ladies,
we loved the moves.

28:05.727 --> 28:09.147
But in my hand...
- Oh, gosh.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.108
- The winner is...

28:17.572 --> 28:19.491
Sheree.
[screaming]

28:19.532 --> 28:22.118
- What?

28:24.579 --> 28:26.122
- I want a recount.

28:26.164 --> 28:27.665
Sheree had two left feet.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.751
I thought we were gonna be
judging off the moves,

28:29.793 --> 28:31.378
and baby girl got it.

28:31.419 --> 28:34.005
- So, you will also get
the bigger room.

28:34.047 --> 28:35.382
[laughing]

28:39.928 --> 28:41.137
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

28:41.179 --> 28:41.971
So nice meeting you.
- That was so much fun.

28:42.013 --> 28:43.515
- No problem.
Thank you.

28:43.556 --> 28:44.474
**

28:44.516 --> 28:45.767
- I don't know
about you guys,

28:45.809 --> 28:46.976
but I have worked up
an appetite.

28:47.018 --> 28:49.229
- Me, too, starving.
- Gotta eat.

28:49.270 --> 28:50.480
- Everybody looked great.

28:50.522 --> 28:53.566
Every single one of you
did a great job.

28:55.777 --> 28:56.945
We have arrived.

28:56.986 --> 28:57.862
- Can I show y'all
to your table?

28:57.904 --> 29:00.240
- Yes, please.
- You got it.

29:02.033 --> 29:03.952
- That was so fun.
- That was fun.

29:03.993 --> 29:05.495
- It was fabulous.

29:05.537 --> 29:07.247
- Can I get y'all anything other
than water started to drink

29:07.288 --> 29:09.624
while y'all are here?
- Do you have a-a mojito?

29:09.666 --> 29:11.126
- Blueberry, as well?
- Can I have one, too, please?

29:11.167 --> 29:12.544
- We wanted to put in
our food order.

29:12.585 --> 29:13.670
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

29:13.712 --> 29:15.588
- Thank you. The, uh, gumbo.
- Perfect.

29:15.630 --> 29:17.632
- Um, I'll have
the ancho Caesar with shrimp.

29:17.674 --> 29:19.092
- Yes, ma'am.

29:19.134 --> 29:20.552
- I'm gonna have the rack
of lamb, medium well, please.

29:20.593 --> 29:21.594
- Yes, ma'am.

29:21.636 --> 29:22.512
- And I'll do
the grilled salmon.

29:22.554 --> 29:24.597
- Yes. Thank you.
- Thank you.

29:24.639 --> 29:26.141
[phone ringing]

29:26.182 --> 29:28.476
- What's up?
What you doing?

29:29.644 --> 29:30.812
- Huh?

29:30.854 --> 29:32.188
We're in Birmingham.

29:32.230 --> 29:34.190
So, I'll hit you and let you
know when I get back.

29:35.025 --> 29:36.568
- All right.
- Thank you.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.403
- Is this your daughter's dad?
- Father.

29:38.445 --> 29:39.320
- Okay.

29:39.362 --> 29:40.989
- Is his name Bryce?
- Mm-hmm.

29:41.031 --> 29:42.824
- Do you guys have--
- I only know one Bryce,

29:42.866 --> 29:44.576
and he was the music guy.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.286
- That's-that's probably him.
He's in music.

29:46.327 --> 29:47.620
- He was in
a three-person group.

29:47.662 --> 29:48.747
- Groove Theory.
- Yes.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.081
- That's him.
- No!

29:50.123 --> 29:51.374
- That's the--
that's the father of your kid?

29:51.416 --> 29:52.709
- So, we did a movie together.
We did a movie.

29:52.751 --> 29:54.085
- Did you?
- "Trois."

29:54.127 --> 29:56.338
We had scenes together.

29:56.379 --> 29:59.257
He was stunningly beautiful.

29:59.299 --> 30:02.552
I have not seen a picture
of this man in 30 years.

30:02.594 --> 30:03.803
- Hey.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.680
- Bryce, we have someone
here we want you to see.

30:05.722 --> 30:07.849
[laughing]
- Ta-da!

30:07.891 --> 30:11.019
- Oh, hi.
[laughing]

30:11.061 --> 30:12.854
- Hilarious.
- What's up?

30:12.896 --> 30:14.147
I can't hear him.
- Yeah.

30:16.316 --> 30:20.278
- No shade, he was
a beautiful man in the '90s.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.238
I'll leave it there.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.698
- I can't hear it.
- Yeah. Your volume is trash.

30:23.740 --> 30:26.576
- Does anybody have a--
- We'll call those guys later.

30:26.618 --> 30:27.994
- Oh, my gosh.

30:28.036 --> 30:29.371
- So, was everybody
gettin' along great

30:29.412 --> 30:33.124
other than Kandi and Courtney
at the concert?

30:33.166 --> 30:35.585
- There was one other big,
you know...

30:38.838 --> 30:40.632
- Who are you
talking about?

30:40.674 --> 30:42.425
- I have no idea.

30:42.467 --> 30:44.678
- Somebody was saying
that it was a fight

30:44.719 --> 30:47.514
between Drew and Marlo.

30:47.555 --> 30:49.474
- You see Marlo going off
on me?

30:49.516 --> 30:51.559
- Oh, he mentioned.
- No.

30:54.187 --> 30:57.232
- She was just very upset
with Drew.

30:57.273 --> 30:58.233
- You weren't even
there with me.

30:58.274 --> 30:59.401
So, what happened
with me and Drew?

30:59.442 --> 31:00.318
- Hold on, Marlo.
You're talking over me.

31:00.360 --> 31:03.029
- I can talk over you.

31:03.071 --> 31:05.323
Who are you to not-not
talk over?

31:05.365 --> 31:06.908
- Because it's rude.

31:06.950 --> 31:08.118
- What did you say?
Because what?

31:10.036 --> 31:11.496
You're worried about rude?

31:11.538 --> 31:13.707
- I have not been
not nice to you.

31:13.748 --> 31:15.792
I have been very pleasant.
- So, let's not be not nice now.

31:15.834 --> 31:19.671
**

31:28.221 --> 31:29.848
- I can talk over you.
- It's rude.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.516
- You're worried about rude?

31:31.558 --> 31:32.517
- See, this is what
I'm talking about.

31:32.559 --> 31:33.476
- We don't have
to talk about it.

31:33.518 --> 31:35.061
- I have not been
not nice to you.

31:35.103 --> 31:36.855
I have been very pleasant.
- So, let's not be not nice now.

31:36.896 --> 31:38.940
- But I'm just talking to you.
I'm not not being nice.

31:38.982 --> 31:40.025
I was just pointing the facts.
- Okay, well,

31:40.066 --> 31:41.359
tell the truth then.

31:41.401 --> 31:42.277
If you don't know what
happened with me and Drew,

31:42.318 --> 31:44.487
you don't know
what happened.

31:44.529 --> 31:46.531
- Well, I did speak
to Drew,

31:46.573 --> 31:48.867
and there are tons
of people with camera phones

31:48.908 --> 31:50.326
and everything around.

31:50.368 --> 31:54.539
Drew basically was saying
that Marlo was attacking her.

31:54.581 --> 31:56.249
She was standing over her,

31:56.291 --> 31:58.293
and she was being
very aggressive.

31:58.335 --> 31:59.878
- No, I was not.

31:59.919 --> 32:01.713
- No disrespect to any of
your of your family.

32:01.755 --> 32:03.340
I've had--
I've lost a lot family.

32:03.381 --> 32:04.841
I'm from Chicago.

32:04.883 --> 32:07.010
- I was upset with Drew.

32:07.052 --> 32:10.513
I was not standing over her,
and I was not aggressive to her.

32:10.555 --> 32:13.058
Kenya was not even there
for the argument.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.226
Why are you even
discussing this?

32:15.268 --> 32:16.978
Was not.
- That's not the truth.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.813
- There was something that
triggered you, right?

32:18.855 --> 32:20.231
- I mean, you know what it was,
and you know.

32:20.273 --> 32:21.775
So, if you wanna speak on
my behalf...

32:24.194 --> 32:26.780
- You can leave.
We don't need you here.

32:26.821 --> 32:28.156
- You like to boss
people around.

32:28.198 --> 32:29.949
You got in charge issues.
- M'kay.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.242
Well, we're talking about
my issues with you.

32:31.284 --> 32:32.535
- And we're talking
about you now, though.

32:32.577 --> 32:33.703
Talking about how you try
and run everything.

32:33.745 --> 32:35.205
- But what does that have
to do with you?

32:35.246 --> 32:36.414
What are we talking about,
right now?

32:36.456 --> 32:37.749
- Whatever I just said.
It don't have to--

32:37.791 --> 32:38.958
it don't matter.
- So, you're just
talking to talk,

32:39.000 --> 32:40.293
to hear yourself.
- I can just talk to talk,

32:40.335 --> 32:41.127
and you keep responding.
- Okay, that's what it is.

32:41.169 --> 32:42.379
- So, you're just as silly.

32:42.420 --> 32:43.963
- 'Cause when a clown
invites you to a circus,

32:44.005 --> 32:46.966
and you play around,
then everybody is a clown

32:47.008 --> 32:49.260
talking to that clown.

32:49.302 --> 32:51.096
- I need another cocktail.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.639
- Our circus be lit.

32:52.681 --> 32:56.101
- Marlo struggles with
what personality she wants

32:56.142 --> 32:57.185
to present to the world,

32:57.227 --> 32:59.604
and she often
presents the fake one.

32:59.646 --> 33:03.566
You can put lipstick on a pig,
but it's still Marlo Hampton.

33:03.608 --> 33:05.485
- Can we just go back?

33:05.527 --> 33:07.612
[laughing]
No, seriously, I'm drunk.

33:07.654 --> 33:10.907
- She threw, t-h-r-e-w.

33:10.949 --> 33:13.118
- Threw.
[laughing]

33:13.159 --> 33:14.828
- Oh, I don't know either.

33:14.869 --> 33:17.664
She doesn't know sh--.
- It's t-h-r-o-u-g-h.

33:17.706 --> 33:20.291
[laughing]

33:20.333 --> 33:21.793
- Well, tonight should be fun.

33:21.835 --> 33:23.336
You know, it's just
a cocktail thing.

33:24.879 --> 33:25.839
[laughing]

33:25.880 --> 33:27.298
They'll be like
we-we invite her.

33:27.340 --> 33:28.925
She's like, "Hey,
can I have five more?"

33:28.967 --> 33:31.261
- No, they're gonna
accommodate me.

33:31.302 --> 33:32.887
Come on. You know.

33:32.929 --> 33:34.597
- What time do we
have to be downstairs?

33:34.639 --> 33:36.349
- I'm gonna
give you until 7.

33:36.391 --> 33:38.393
- We gotta go now.
- It's 5:30.

33:38.435 --> 33:40.228
- I gotta go upstairs
and wash my butt.

33:40.270 --> 33:42.564
- All right. Let's go.
- Okay, vamanos.

33:42.605 --> 33:44.607
- Lordy have mercy.
- Thank you.

33:44.649 --> 33:51.156
**

33:51.197 --> 33:53.158
Checking in for Moore.

33:53.199 --> 33:55.368
- Ready to get
in my suite.

33:56.369 --> 33:58.913
- 1303.

33:58.955 --> 34:00.665
All right, this is it.

34:00.707 --> 34:03.418
- Oh, this is so cute.
I love the view.

34:09.007 --> 34:12.719
- This is not no damn suite.
Is there another?

34:12.761 --> 34:15.597
What the (BLEEP), Kenya?
Hostess with the least.

34:15.638 --> 34:17.557
This is not a suite.

34:17.599 --> 34:18.725
I've been played!

34:18.767 --> 34:21.519
[echoing]

34:21.561 --> 34:24.564
- Oh, no, this is
the kicker for me.

34:24.606 --> 34:25.940
- Oh, okay.
- Bitch gave
miniature champagne.

34:25.982 --> 34:27.692
Bitch, you couldn't
get a bottle?

34:27.734 --> 34:30.653
Last year, on my trip to
Blue Ridge, I had concierge,

34:30.695 --> 34:33.698
24-hour chefs,
cheese boards, cocktails.

34:33.740 --> 34:36.868
You're giving us
mini champagne bottles?

34:36.910 --> 34:38.495
Are you serious?

34:38.536 --> 34:39.788
Kenya is so tacky.

34:39.829 --> 34:41.873
Like, where is my gift,
Kenya?

34:41.915 --> 34:43.792
I'm gonna need a manager
when you get a moment

34:43.833 --> 34:46.127
and if they could just
send me up a cocktail

34:46.169 --> 34:47.087
'cause I don't know
what kind of wine that is.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.589
- Okay.
[coughs]

34:57.263 --> 34:59.224
Brooklyn-Brooklyn, stop.

34:59.265 --> 35:00.392
Brooklyn.

35:00.433 --> 35:02.519
It's really hard
to leave Brooklyn.

35:02.560 --> 35:03.770
Like, she just got here.

35:03.812 --> 35:05.230
I wanna spend time
with her,

35:05.271 --> 35:06.398
but it will all pay off

35:06.439 --> 35:08.024
when we can be at
the parade tomorrow

35:08.066 --> 35:10.819
and when she can see
mommy on the field.

35:18.910 --> 35:21.579
Monyetta, we're going to
a nice charity event.

35:21.621 --> 35:22.789
We're not going
to a strip club.

35:24.541 --> 35:26.084
We gotta go.

35:26.126 --> 35:28.420
Your move somethin' jumpsuit is
not appropriate here, girl.

35:28.461 --> 35:31.423
Go back upstairs
and change.

35:31.464 --> 35:32.590
Whoo!

35:34.509 --> 35:36.720
**

35:36.761 --> 35:38.805
Thank you for
being on time.

35:40.765 --> 35:41.891
I thought everybody
looked nice.

35:41.933 --> 35:45.145
All they had to do was
just, like-- yeah.

35:45.186 --> 35:47.397
- Shower and-- shower took
the longest part.

35:47.439 --> 35:50.567
- Yeah.
[phone ringing]

35:50.608 --> 35:52.652
Hey, Monyetta.

35:52.694 --> 35:53.903
- Can you hear me?

35:53.945 --> 35:55.780
I just remembered
I got a little black dress.

35:55.822 --> 35:57.615
- Monyetta, you gotta
meet us there. I'm sorry.

35:57.657 --> 35:59.034
I gotta be there
by 8:15.

35:59.075 --> 36:00.660
All right. See you later.
- Okay, all right.

36:00.702 --> 36:03.038
- Okay, bye.
Okay, let's go, guys.

36:03.079 --> 36:04.372
We're so late.

36:04.414 --> 36:07.292
Tonight is a special event
to raise funds

36:07.334 --> 36:09.794
for both of the HBCUs.

36:09.836 --> 36:12.213
As a participant, I agreed
to be at this party

36:12.255 --> 36:14.674
at a certain time,
and I am not going to be late

36:14.716 --> 36:16.968
because these girls
are inconsiderate.

36:17.010 --> 36:19.304
I cannot wait and wait
and wait and wait

36:19.346 --> 36:21.473
on other ladies.
- Right.

36:21.514 --> 36:23.308
[sighs]

36:23.350 --> 36:25.143
- This is the stuff
I can't stand.

36:25.185 --> 36:26.603
Coming up next...

36:26.644 --> 36:28.438
We can't stay.
We gotta go.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.106
- We gotta go?
- We're getting kicked out?

36:30.148 --> 36:31.483
- Yeah.
Sorry, guys.

36:31.524 --> 36:32.942
**

36:37.739 --> 36:40.992
- Monyetta, okay, well,
you'll probably see the van.

36:41.034 --> 36:42.494
Okay, bye.

36:42.535 --> 36:44.537
You should always pack
a little black dress

36:44.579 --> 36:45.872
no matter where you go.

36:45.914 --> 36:52.671
* I can't deny it
I can't deny it *

36:52.712 --> 36:55.674
Yes, okay conservative.
That was a big change.

36:55.715 --> 36:57.384
- Takes me no time
to change,

36:57.425 --> 36:58.885
and then I arrive
at the same time.

36:58.927 --> 37:01.554
So, y'all could've waited.
Y'all are petty as hell.

37:01.596 --> 37:04.641
Ooh, party.

37:04.683 --> 37:07.185
- So, the dress code
for this event

37:07.227 --> 37:09.479
is fashion forward.

37:09.521 --> 37:11.523
It's cocktail.

37:11.564 --> 37:14.526
It's bring your best.

37:14.567 --> 37:16.236
Hi. How are you?

37:16.277 --> 37:19.322
Hi. Hello. Hi.

37:19.364 --> 37:20.407
I like those pants.
- Hi.

37:20.448 --> 37:22.701
- Cute.

37:22.742 --> 37:25.745
- Girl, listen.

37:25.787 --> 37:27.831
How you doin'? Hi.
- Good to see you.

37:27.872 --> 37:29.833
- Yeah, nice to see you.

37:29.874 --> 37:31.418
- Wait. Where are we going?
What are we doing?

37:31.459 --> 37:32.585
- I don't know.

37:32.627 --> 37:34.754
- Let me get a little selfie
with y'all.

37:34.796 --> 37:36.256
- Okay, just give me
one second.

37:36.297 --> 37:39.509
**

37:39.551 --> 37:41.261
- This is my-- this is
my son. So...

37:41.302 --> 37:43.221
- Were we dropped off
at the wrong address

37:43.263 --> 37:46.516
because this is definitely
not the upscale event

37:46.558 --> 37:48.226
Kenya had been
raving about.

37:48.268 --> 37:50.020
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

37:50.061 --> 37:50.937
- Yes.

37:50.979 --> 37:52.647
**

38:03.199 --> 38:04.367
- Let it go.

38:04.409 --> 38:06.619
- Hi. How you doin'?
- It's good. What up?

38:06.661 --> 38:08.121
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

38:08.163 --> 38:10.290
- Can you stop filming,
ma'am? Sorry.

38:11.750 --> 38:14.961
- Okay, let's sit at the table.
- Yeah.

38:15.003 --> 38:16.588
- Girl, it's not
a sit-down situation?

38:16.629 --> 38:17.797
- Thank you.

38:17.839 --> 38:19.674
- This is truly
a cocktail moment.

38:22.010 --> 38:24.054
- Hey, how are you?
- Good. How are you?

38:24.095 --> 38:26.639
- Hi. I'm a big fan.
- Oh, thank you.

38:26.681 --> 38:28.641
- Are you the manager?

38:28.683 --> 38:30.560
- So, the other girls
left us.

38:30.602 --> 38:33.563
Can you let us know how we can
get a bottle and sparkles

38:33.605 --> 38:34.981
to let them know
we have arrived?

38:35.023 --> 38:37.150
All right. Do you need a card?
How much?

38:37.192 --> 38:38.193
- Is that Sanya?

38:38.234 --> 38:39.819
- Oh, and that's Marlo
next to her.

38:39.861 --> 38:41.363
- Sanya!
[overlapping voices]

38:41.404 --> 38:43.073
- You left me for real.

38:43.114 --> 38:45.784
- I gave y'all
an extra 40 minutes.

38:45.825 --> 38:46.826
- No, you didn't give us--
- No one text me.

38:46.868 --> 38:47.827
- 40 minutes.
- Oh, 40 minutes.

38:47.869 --> 38:49.162
- Did you text me, Kenya?

38:49.204 --> 38:51.664
- I wouldn't-- I wouldn't
do you like that.

38:51.706 --> 38:53.792
All this hoopla
for this?

38:53.833 --> 38:55.210
The way Kenya
laid it out,

38:55.251 --> 38:58.380
I thought we were showing up
to the Met Gala, honey.

38:58.421 --> 38:59.589
What's going on?

38:59.631 --> 39:02.384
- At 7:40, you were
not downstairs.

39:02.425 --> 39:06.513
- Yeah.
[cheering]

39:06.554 --> 39:07.972
- Oh, that looks so nice,
Kenya.

39:08.014 --> 39:10.100
- Who sent it?
Marlo and Sanya?

39:10.141 --> 39:11.476
- Yes.

39:11.518 --> 39:14.396
- This cocktail party is
definitely lame like Kenya,

39:14.437 --> 39:17.357
who is looking like
a low rent Carrie Bradshaw.

39:19.567 --> 39:21.069
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:21.111 --> 39:22.779
We're showing you how a party
is supposed to be,

39:22.821 --> 39:24.531
not plastic cups.

39:24.572 --> 39:25.949
- Let's go upstairs

39:25.990 --> 39:27.784
'cause it's
a really cute view here.

39:27.826 --> 39:28.827
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:28.868 --> 39:30.995
- Y'all can bring
y'all's champagne.

39:31.037 --> 39:32.706
- Hurry up, all.
It's closing.

39:32.747 --> 39:35.709
- Wherever you wanna sit.

39:35.750 --> 39:37.377
It's a really beautiful
view up here.

39:37.419 --> 39:38.837
- It's so nice.

39:39.754 --> 39:40.880
- Yeah.

39:45.593 --> 39:46.344
- Wow.

39:49.764 --> 39:52.267
- Yeah.

39:52.308 --> 39:53.393
- Okay.

39:53.435 --> 39:55.270
Basically, production
got kicked out.

39:55.311 --> 39:56.730
I didn't get kicked out.

39:56.771 --> 39:58.064
And that's not my fault.

39:58.106 --> 40:00.567
Either way, my name
is attached to it,

40:00.608 --> 40:02.027
so it's embarrassing.

40:02.068 --> 40:04.029
- Well, what are we doin' now?

40:04.070 --> 40:05.864
[vocalizing]
- Here we go.

40:05.905 --> 40:09.743
Up, down, roll, roll.
- I got a better idea.

40:09.784 --> 40:13.997
Let's do it in the hotel,

40:14.039 --> 40:15.915
'cause I gotta go.

40:15.957 --> 40:17.542
- So, it's time to go?
- I came to Alabama

40:17.584 --> 40:18.752
for a good time!

40:18.793 --> 40:20.086
- We can't stay.
We gotta go.

40:20.128 --> 40:21.755
- We gotta go?
We're getting kicked out?

40:21.796 --> 40:23.840
- Yeah.
Sorry, guys.

40:23.882 --> 40:25.717
- Well, I'm gonna
finish my bottle.

40:25.759 --> 40:28.595
This ain't nothin' but karma
for Kenya ass.

40:28.636 --> 40:30.972
She's tried to control us
all day.

40:31.014 --> 40:32.432
- Sorry, guys.
- Who is kicking us out?

40:32.474 --> 40:33.641
- Let's go.

40:33.683 --> 40:35.352
- But I am enjoying
Miss Karma do her thing.

40:35.393 --> 40:36.811
Do it, Miss Karma.

40:36.853 --> 40:39.022
But we gotta leave already.
[indistinct chatter]

40:40.815 --> 40:42.150
- Yes, yeah.
[laughing]

40:43.943 --> 40:45.111
Kenya, did you not
let them know

40:45.153 --> 40:47.113
that we were coming
in all our fabulousness?

40:47.155 --> 40:48.656
I'm a little
embarrassed, though,

40:48.698 --> 40:49.866
to be getting kicked out
of the space.

40:49.908 --> 40:53.203
I ain't gonna lie.

40:53.244 --> 40:55.121
- Let me duck and hide
for cover, chile.

40:55.163 --> 40:58.291
They don't got to know
SRR was there, too.

40:58.333 --> 41:00.335
It's early.
The trip started off so fun,

41:00.377 --> 41:01.836
but it's like wh--
like, her leaving early,

41:01.878 --> 41:03.338
it just felt very strange.

41:03.380 --> 41:04.964
It just feels like
something is happening,

41:05.006 --> 41:06.925
and we're being left out.

41:06.966 --> 41:08.677
- It was like, bitch,
we didn't even approve this.

41:08.718 --> 41:10.303
Get your ass out,
Kenya Moore.

41:10.345 --> 41:13.139
This ho ain't new to this.
She's true to this.

41:13.181 --> 41:15.934
She done snuck off on us
before in South Carolina.

41:15.975 --> 41:17.060
- Kenya Moore?

41:17.102 --> 41:19.396
- I'm not coming down.

41:19.437 --> 41:20.605
- Are you serious?

41:20.647 --> 41:21.648
- And Blue Ridge.

41:21.690 --> 41:22.607
- I have a house.

41:22.649 --> 41:23.858
- So, you're not
staying with us?

41:23.900 --> 41:26.569
- Summer is over, bitch.
Winter is comin'.

41:26.611 --> 41:28.279
- Let's go to her room.

41:28.321 --> 41:29.364
- Let's go ask her.
- Let's go.

41:29.406 --> 41:30.448
- The charity event,

41:30.490 --> 41:31.908
I would have wore
something different.

41:34.244 --> 41:37.038
[knocking]

41:37.080 --> 41:38.915
- She might be asleep.

41:38.957 --> 41:41.042
- Hey, I can call and get
a key to the room.

41:43.878 --> 41:45.672
[kicking door]
- Oh, sh--.

41:45.714 --> 41:49.676
- Exactly.
[laughing]

41:49.718 --> 41:52.429
[knocking]
- Kenya?

41:54.556 --> 41:57.183
- Who the (BLEEP) is banging
on my goddamn door?

41:57.225 --> 41:58.309
- Summer!

41:58.351 --> 41:59.519
- What the (BLEEP) is
wrong with you?

41:59.561 --> 42:01.396
- Summer! Summer--
- My child is sleeping!

42:01.438 --> 42:02.897
- Summer!
- Get the (BLEEP) out of-- stop!

42:05.900 --> 42:07.861
- No, but, no,
that's bullsh--.

42:07.902 --> 42:09.154
Get your ass out here.

42:09.195 --> 42:10.780
- And put Brooklyn
in another room!

42:10.822 --> 42:13.158
It's about being disrespectful
wit' your broke ass!

42:14.868 --> 42:18.038
- Summer!

42:18.079 --> 42:21.166
- Next time, on "The Real
Housewives of Atlanta"...

42:21.207 --> 42:22.542
- I'm going to go
eat some steak.

42:28.131 --> 42:30.050
- She tried to close the door
on somebody's face.

42:30.091 --> 42:32.010
Does she wanna
go back to jail?

42:39.976 --> 42:41.186
- Don't come back?
- Yeah, but, Kenya--

42:41.227 --> 42:43.355
- All right, well--
- Bitch, you are crazy.

42:43.396 --> 42:45.106
- Someone shared with me
that you said,

42:45.148 --> 42:47.734
"Everything that Sheree gave us
at the reunion...

42:47.776 --> 42:48.902
- Mm-hmm.
- She took back."

42:48.943 --> 42:50.445
- Mm-hmm. I was like,

42:50.487 --> 42:52.822
I almost got my hands
on some She by Sheree.

42:52.864 --> 42:54.949
Like, I was this--
like, it was--

42:54.991 --> 42:56.576
- I need an ambulance,
please.

42:56.618 --> 42:59.913
I'm dizzy and having
a hard time breathing.

42:59.954 --> 43:02.415
[radio chatter
and sirens]

43:02.457 --> 43:04.918
- Just make sure she's okay.
Bring her back strong.

43:04.959 --> 43:06.628
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.
