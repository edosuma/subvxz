01:57.480 --> 02:01.883
For a camel, you
make a triangle like this.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.845
That's the hump.

02:05.920 --> 02:09.561
It's so easy. See?

02:10.000 --> 02:13.721
Then some lines for legs here.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.491
Teacher taught me
how to do this.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.881
He showed me
elephants and cats, too.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.327
But I told him you like camels.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.446
That's the neck.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.288
You're not watching.

02:31.080 --> 02:35.051
Then on top, I put another
triangle for a head.

02:35.120 --> 02:39.808
They have big round eyes
and a skinny tail here.

02:57.400 --> 03:00.131
Little baby, playing with girls?

03:10.720 --> 03:13.246
Get off! Get off him!

03:27.920 --> 03:29.126
Stop!

03:32.800 --> 03:34.564
Don't touch her!

04:15.720 --> 04:17.005
He's dead.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.323
Eleazer's dead!

04:26.960 --> 04:30.362
Over there. He did it.

04:35.800 --> 04:39.043
You! You killed him!

04:39.880 --> 04:41.689
That man told you to say that.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.685
What man?

04:48.840 --> 04:51.650
The apple! Eleazer
tripped on the apple.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.209
You killed him. We all saw it.

05:01.560 --> 05:05.201
He did it. He killed him.
He killed him.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.930
Eleazer!

05:32.320 --> 05:33.321
Eleazer...

05:33.920 --> 05:36.810
You killed Eleazer.
We all saw it.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.962
Mama. Come.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.171
There was a man. He told
them that I... Shh.

05:48.560 --> 05:49.561
Go.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.928
Go home. Go.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.450
James, close the door.

06:10.640 --> 06:11.687
Sit.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.491
Show me your face.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.843
What's happened?
Jesus killed Eleazer!

06:35.160 --> 06:37.049
Don't say that!
He's your cousin.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.849
He couldn't.
There's no evil in him.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.441
But he did! He cursed him,
and Eleazer fell dead.

06:44.680 --> 06:48.480
Don't you threaten me.
Never! Not my nephew!

06:49.800 --> 06:51.643
Joseph, they're all out there.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.166
Jonathan bar Zakkai
and his brothers.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.163
They're saying
he killed that boy.

06:59.560 --> 07:03.201
How could that be? Eleazer's twice
as big and a bully to boot.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.403
It's envy, that's what it is.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.720
We've got the jobs they wanted.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.001
Enough!

07:09.560 --> 07:10.561
Is the boy dead?

07:10.640 --> 07:12.324
Our son is not a murderer.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.807
Is he dead or does he live?
Can anyone tell me?

07:15.880 --> 07:17.609
Is the boy dead?

07:17.680 --> 07:19.330
He was not moving.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.849
You saved me.

07:32.360 --> 07:33.725
I didn't hurt him.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.770
Just do what you did before.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.365
Like the dead bird.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.605
Go on.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.770
I won't tell.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.890
Wake up.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.682
Wake up now.

10:30.640 --> 10:31.800
You!

10:33.040 --> 10:34.610
How dare you come here!

10:34.680 --> 10:36.808
Get out! Get out,
you vile little...

10:40.720 --> 10:41.767
Vile...

10:46.240 --> 10:48.242
Son of David! Son of David!

10:49.840 --> 10:51.251
Come! Come! Quickly, help!

10:58.560 --> 10:59.721
Go!

11:32.720 --> 11:36.167
Where did you learn medicine?
From cavemen in Britain?

11:36.320 --> 11:38.163
The boy was dead,
I'm telling you.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.444
How could that boy be dead?
Look at him!

11:41.600 --> 11:42.931
He was dead.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.840
Because of him.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.929
Well, he's not dead now.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.286
He's possessed.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.566
He killed my boy and then
brought him back again.

11:53.640 --> 11:54.687
Only Satan can do that.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.968
So you're complaining
he's alive?

11:57.120 --> 11:58.645
Why don't
you go back to Galilee?

11:58.960 --> 12:00.371
Take your tools and your women

12:00.440 --> 12:02.160
and your bewitched children,
and just leave.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.171
Seven years is too long.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.322
We're done with you.
We don't want you here.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.209
Eleazer is alive.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.483
For which we thank God.

12:25.480 --> 12:29.280
As it happens, we're going
back to Galilee anyway.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.410
What, because of a
little hubbub in the street?

12:32.720 --> 12:33.846
No.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.845
Because Herod is dead.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.371
We can return now.

12:49.800 --> 12:50.961
Is that true?

12:51.080 --> 12:52.684
Is it all my fault? Yes!

12:53.280 --> 12:55.203
He's just a little boy!

13:04.880 --> 13:06.245
Wait for me here.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.000
Nobody else can do what you did.
You know that?

13:21.200 --> 13:23.407
How can I? Tell me.

13:28.520 --> 13:29.646
Please?

13:29.720 --> 13:31.210
They won't let me.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.083
They're saying
that with a touch,

13:40.920 --> 13:43.491
a simple touch, he raised
him from the dead.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.763
It's confirmed, isn't it?

13:49.040 --> 13:50.849
Did you ever doubt it?

13:50.920 --> 13:53.048
No. No. It's just...

13:54.760 --> 13:56.603
It's just so soon.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.288
How do you know
that Herod's dead?

14:05.240 --> 14:06.810
I had a dream today.

14:10.640 --> 14:11.971
Before all of this.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.570
That he's dead?
Or that we have to go back?

14:18.640 --> 14:19.926
Both.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.171
It was a dream that I had that
brought us here, remember?

14:25.600 --> 14:27.489
And it turned out to be true.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.287
Had we not left Bethlehem that
night, our son would be dead.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.807
This was the same kind of dream.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.490
So we're destined to wander.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.445
Like all Jews.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.688
Not wandering, going home.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.891
Nazareth, not Bethlehem.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.170
Never Bethlehem.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.522
What do we tell
our frightened little boy?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.646
How do we explain
what happened today?

15:21.560 --> 15:23.642
How do we explain God
to his own son?

15:25.320 --> 15:27.163
I can't. Can you?

15:39.840 --> 15:44.528
You're a child that
needs a meal and a nap.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.927
What is it? JESUS: Him!

15:56.840 --> 15:59.207
Him! Don't you see him?

15:59.360 --> 16:01.567
Who? JESUS: Him!

16:05.200 --> 16:07.009
Who? Him!

16:09.680 --> 16:11.409
Come, child,
you need to rest.

16:52.840 --> 16:55.571
This sea air's enough
to kill an elephant.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.000
You're the one who said you
didn't want to die in the desert.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.763
Who's dying? MAN: All of us.

17:04.319 --> 17:05.970
But it'll probably be in Jericho

17:06.760 --> 17:09.444
or Bethlehem
or some other snake pit.

17:09.839 --> 17:11.569
I was born in Bethlehem.

17:11.720 --> 17:12.960
Were you, boy?

17:14.880 --> 17:16.006
How old are you?

17:16.079 --> 17:17.888
Too young to talk to strangers.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.406
We live up north.
Nazareth.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.568
No boys his age
in Bethlehem anyway.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.449
Why not?

17:38.880 --> 17:40.041
Herod took care of that.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.482
Come over here, little one.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.885
You going through Jerusalem?

17:48.960 --> 17:50.530
Greatest city in the world!

17:52.040 --> 17:53.610
Avoid it.

17:53.680 --> 17:57.526
Pilgrims seeking answers in the temples
find only riots and violence there.

17:58.920 --> 18:01.207
Bandits, rebels, soldiers
taking what and who they want.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.002
Herod's soldiers are protected...
What is it?

18:08.960 --> 18:10.849
It's the best camel
I've ever seen!

18:14.000 --> 18:15.001
Here.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.608
It's a gift for
the boy from Bethlehem.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.329
For your travels.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.851
Thank you.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.964
It won't be long before
we have a kitchen again.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.246
You'd like that.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.365
Stop!

19:17.440 --> 19:18.521
Come, daughter.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.888
Husband, who are you talking to?

19:26.080 --> 19:27.081
God.

19:28.920 --> 19:31.002
He's talking to God.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.127
Ah...

19:32.200 --> 19:34.521
Tell Joseph.

19:35.560 --> 19:36.607
Cleopas.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.487
Uncle Cleopas
is coughing again.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.524
We'll rest for a few minutes.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.167
I'm not tired. Can I go ahead?

19:53.280 --> 19:55.681
All right, but not far.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.042
Just up to the pass,
and then wait for us.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.206
James, go with him.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.770
He'll be fine.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.646
Whoa.

20:42.720 --> 20:43.801
Psst.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.323
Go! Get on! Get out!

22:06.400 --> 22:07.526
Stay!

22:43.360 --> 22:44.521
Boy!

22:58.000 --> 22:59.968
Son, come here!

23:05.560 --> 23:07.642
We had nothing to do
with this, Centurion.

23:08.280 --> 23:10.362
We are not rebels.
We're travelers.

23:23.240 --> 23:25.368
Next time
there will be no mercy.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.161
Go!

23:57.680 --> 23:59.091
Come with me.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.521
<i>Fill it.</i>

24:14.480 --> 24:15.766
Go.

24:36.680 --> 24:39.650
<i>There's a boy
who can perform miracles.</i>

24:41.000 --> 24:45.688
And in Alexandria,
he raised a boy from the dead.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.407
That's the rumor.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.481
Rumor?

24:49.200 --> 24:51.362
You call them the mob, Severus.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.723
We call them the Rejected.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.680
Listen to them, to the street,

24:57.760 --> 24:59.330
and you'll know what's going on.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.607
Sounds like
the Jewish madness.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.120
There's a messiah behind every
tree, under every rock.

25:04.160 --> 25:07.562
I'm Jewish.
Do I have the madness?

25:11.800 --> 25:13.325
You served my father.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.404
How long have you been in Judea?

25:18.520 --> 25:19.601
Eight years.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.920
Were you in Bethlehem?

25:24.800 --> 25:26.529
Yes, I was.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.250
Then you understand.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.529
You've done it before.

25:33.280 --> 25:34.281
Oh...

25:46.800 --> 25:48.245
Damn serpents!

25:58.480 --> 26:00.642
I can't send my troops.

26:01.760 --> 26:06.163
Jews won't do it again.
Not a child. Not the...

26:09.560 --> 26:11.244
Not the Messiah.

26:13.920 --> 26:14.921
Get out!

26:15.160 --> 26:19.802
I've had enough of you, witches
and lizard-eaters. Go! Go!

26:32.200 --> 26:34.202
I know what they said
about my father.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.886
They won't say it about me.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.206
You have your assignment,

27:00.080 --> 27:01.969
Centurion.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.768
I saw him! That man who died.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.929
You were sleeping.
It was just a dream.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.411
It was so real.

27:57.720 --> 28:00.803
You have to watch out
for those dreams, nephew.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.370
It runs in the family.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.566
Well, they do.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.407
In fact, we have dreams
to thank for being here.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.165
Come to think of it,

28:10.240 --> 28:12.242
every big decision
this family has made

28:12.320 --> 28:15.005
in the last eight years
is because of dreams.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.685
Hush.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.002
What do you mean?
You're not to ask.

28:19.160 --> 28:22.926
Why not? Teacher always
answered my questions.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.645
So did the rabbi.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.161
Uncle?

28:28.840 --> 28:30.842
You've got to tell him sometime.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.604
I'll get water. Joseph!

28:39.840 --> 28:43.401
Cure him! Cure him!
I know you can.

28:43.480 --> 28:46.370
I can't! They told me not to.

28:47.240 --> 28:50.801
I don't understand.
Don't you love him?

29:24.520 --> 29:27.330
You know what they say about
Herod the Dead, don't you?

29:27.400 --> 29:28.686
Do you mean Herod the Great?

29:35.520 --> 29:38.729
They say he choked to death
on the blood of children.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.720
You've killed children before.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.370
So have you.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.843
No doubt I'll kill more.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.244
You didn't tell the men.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.165
A few officers know.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.006
They'll keep watch
for him and so will we.

30:03.320 --> 30:04.924
I don't want to start
a general panic.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.640
No.

30:06.720 --> 30:10.725
And when we come across him,
we'll do our duty.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.525
It's a small task.

30:19.720 --> 30:22.166
It's a small boy.

30:26.240 --> 30:29.403
I do as ordered.
The boy must die.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.605
<i>Praise to the Lord!</i>

30:40.080 --> 30:44.085
I will sing praises to God!

30:44.560 --> 30:47.086
But no,
not to so-called princes,

30:48.080 --> 30:53.120
kings, tax-mongers,
bandits, mercenaries!

30:57.840 --> 30:59.569
He's scaring everyone.
I'm going to get him.

30:59.720 --> 31:03.566
Leave him. If he's to die,
let him die as he wants.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.689
By the River Jordan,

31:07.200 --> 31:11.285
raving over king and taxes
and shouting at the Lord.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.445
O Lord of Zion,

31:13.960 --> 31:16.042
you shall reign forever

31:16.200 --> 31:18.965
as you wash me
in your living waters!

31:19.040 --> 31:20.201
Father?

31:22.040 --> 31:23.280
Father?

31:23.960 --> 31:27.521
Oh, Lord, everyone yet
to be born will hear me,

31:28.120 --> 31:29.963
praise your faithfulness!

31:30.960 --> 31:32.610
Happy am I,

31:35.080 --> 31:37.651
brother to the
prophesized virgin,

31:38.240 --> 31:42.325
uncle to the promised.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.848
Lord Father, let us keep him.

31:56.800 --> 32:00.247
God, I ask this.
Is this too much?

32:01.440 --> 32:05.968
Let us keep him, please,
for as long as you will.

33:04.480 --> 33:07.404
Did you see that? He's a healer.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.324
That little boy,
I saw him do it.

33:11.200 --> 33:15.330
That man was sick and now he's
well, and the boy did it.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.331
Maybe it's the Devil. Nonsense.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.280
- Give him to me.
- We should rejoice!

33:23.600 --> 33:25.807
He's fine! How do you know?

33:26.080 --> 33:27.923
Because of who he is.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.806
This is dangerous.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.530
It's a miracle!

33:32.280 --> 33:33.611
There are witnesses.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.442
They're charlatans
using our faith against us.

33:38.520 --> 33:40.124
Rabbi, praises!

33:40.280 --> 33:41.361
We saw.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.441
They'll hurt us
all, don't you see?

33:42.600 --> 33:45.080
Bless the Lord!

33:45.280 --> 33:46.361
Son...

33:50.120 --> 33:51.485
Where's the food?

34:01.560 --> 34:02.800
Drink.

34:13.639 --> 34:15.324
He's all better.

34:17.400 --> 34:18.764
Are you mad at me?

34:19.960 --> 34:22.770
How could we be mad at you?
We love him, too.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.370
We just have to be careful.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.161
Am I dangerous?

34:27.239 --> 34:29.719
No, but others are.

34:30.159 --> 34:31.844
And we need
to keep away from them.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.126
Because of me?

34:35.560 --> 34:37.880
Because I can do things
nobody else can?

34:43.679 --> 34:45.330
There were angels at the river.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.571
I couldn't see them,
but they were there.

34:50.639 --> 34:52.483
How do I know that?

34:54.520 --> 34:56.090
You have to stop
asking these questions.

34:56.679 --> 34:57.841
Why won't you tell me?

34:57.920 --> 34:59.200
Because you're
too young to know.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.762
When will I be old enough?

35:02.240 --> 35:04.163
When your father
decides you are.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.161
Mother?

35:13.680 --> 35:15.682
I prayed for my big
brother to get better.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.205
And he did.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.722
Let that be enough for today.

35:48.240 --> 35:51.562
We're done. Go. Leave!

35:56.680 --> 35:57.681
Well?

35:58.000 --> 35:59.843
They claimed to have seen a boy

35:59.920 --> 36:01.126
heal a sick man
at the Jordan River.

36:01.240 --> 36:02.287
A miracle.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.486
What happened to the boy?

36:03.560 --> 36:04.641
They don't know.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.765
Anything else? Names?

36:11.240 --> 36:13.083
Other people
traveling with them?

36:13.760 --> 36:17.082
Something distinctive?

36:17.440 --> 36:19.681
No. Just Jews.

36:19.760 --> 36:21.091
Same story again.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.965
Yes. It's a popular one.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.442
They all love their miracles.

36:25.600 --> 36:29.446
There's only one miracle.
That's Roman steel.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.441
Mother?

36:49.760 --> 36:50.921
Come.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.602
Joseph!
Come on, come on, come on!

37:23.920 --> 37:25.922
Stay away! Stay away! Shh.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.248
It's all right.
I won't hurt you.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.323
- Stay away! Stay away!
- Shh.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.767
Stay away! Stay away... Shh.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.001
I won't hurt you.

38:14.560 --> 38:18.042
Are you... What? Unclean?

38:18.440 --> 38:20.169
That's not what I meant.

38:21.680 --> 38:24.684
I just wondered if he...

38:24.840 --> 38:28.481
Yes, he did.
And he'd do it to you, too.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.368
He killed my master and his
wife, then burned the house.

38:40.720 --> 38:42.006
I hid in the tunnels.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.286
Tunnels?

38:45.840 --> 38:47.046
Under the house.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.530
But he found me.

38:53.920 --> 38:58.164
Bandits. They're like locusts,
destroying everything in their path.

38:59.560 --> 39:01.722
He was taking me
to Sepphoris to sell.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.610
I was born in Sepphoris.

39:04.320 --> 39:05.924
It's not far from here,
near Nazareth.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.967
You're good Jews.
Don't go there.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.489
It's a world on fire.

39:33.680 --> 39:37.685
Here. You'll need these
to walk to Nazareth with us.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.802
Am I going to Nazareth with you?

40:04.560 --> 40:06.050
Joseph will decide.

40:12.080 --> 40:15.004
We're safe. All of us.

40:19.880 --> 40:23.885
He's buried.
No one will find him.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.885
Father, can she come with us?

40:30.680 --> 40:32.250
As a sister?

40:34.040 --> 40:35.326
Yes.

40:47.280 --> 40:48.884
Smells like Egypt.

41:11.640 --> 41:14.530
Nephew. Nephew.

41:18.360 --> 41:22.251
It was a killing,
but it wasn't murder.

41:22.640 --> 41:26.406
The wrong was his.
Not hers, not ours.

41:27.280 --> 41:28.725
The water...

41:29.560 --> 41:31.244
The purification ritual...

41:31.320 --> 41:34.881
God himself gave it
to the Jews on Sinai.

41:35.080 --> 41:37.003
Yes. But now I know why.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.241
This is good.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.331
Hand me the tunic.

41:43.880 --> 41:47.043
You should be with your mother.
Go now. Go on.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.563
- What are you doing?
- Listening to him.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.290
You might consider
doing it yourself.

41:59.640 --> 42:02.371
Can't you see he's
bursting with questions?

42:03.640 --> 42:07.611
He's seen a lot for a little boy.
For that matter, we all have.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.925
What are you implying?

42:12.120 --> 42:15.966
I don't imply. If I have
something to say, I say it.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.967
Then say it! He needs answers!

42:21.040 --> 42:22.326
We need answers.

42:22.400 --> 42:23.640
I don't have them!

42:23.960 --> 42:27.806
He has them! Must I remind you
that we are men of faith.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.764
He's just a child.

42:37.800 --> 42:39.006
No.

42:40.080 --> 42:42.526
I was just a child,
and so were you.

42:44.680 --> 42:45.681
But, he...

42:47.120 --> 42:49.248
He is not just a child.

43:13.040 --> 43:14.405
Come with me, boy.

43:22.520 --> 43:25.842
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

43:26.280 --> 43:28.851
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.361
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

43:31.520 --> 43:33.170
He restoreth my soul.

43:34.600 --> 43:38.207
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

43:38.560 --> 43:41.131
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

43:41.200 --> 43:43.965
I will fear no evil
for thou art with me.

43:44.120 --> 43:47.169
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

43:47.600 --> 43:49.409
Thou preparest a table before me

43:49.520 --> 43:51.249
in the presence of mine enemies.

43:51.320 --> 43:55.120
Thou anointeth my head with
oil, my cup runneth over.

43:55.840 --> 43:58.366
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow...

43:58.440 --> 43:59.885
...all the days of my life.

44:00.040 --> 44:02.566
And I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.

44:13.680 --> 44:15.284
Keep on, son. Keep walking.

44:17.560 --> 44:18.925
Keep walking.

44:52.480 --> 44:57.361
Eyes down. Do as I say.
Do as I say. Eyes down.

46:02.680 --> 46:06.321
Nazareth.
Right where we left it.

46:44.440 --> 46:46.169
Mother,
are we almost there?

46:46.680 --> 46:48.682
Yes, it's just ahead.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.331
Jews!

47:22.000 --> 47:23.126
Stay where you are.

47:27.760 --> 47:29.125
Look at you.

47:33.280 --> 47:37.171
All the Nazarenes that are
left gathered here together

47:37.920 --> 47:39.524
in one courtyard.

47:43.080 --> 47:44.320
Let's crucify them.

47:45.640 --> 47:47.085
We're not guilty of anything.

47:47.240 --> 47:51.325
Not one single rebel among you?
Not one escaped slave?

47:53.080 --> 47:54.764
We can't go back
without someone.

47:55.440 --> 47:58.410
I'll go. Take me. No!

47:58.600 --> 48:01.649
I was saved at the river for this.
To die for the family.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.844
No. If someone must go,

48:07.040 --> 48:08.087
it'll be me.

48:14.320 --> 48:16.084
State my crime. It should be me.

48:19.520 --> 48:20.760
You all know why.

48:20.840 --> 48:22.080
I like her idea.

48:22.760 --> 48:24.888
My lords!

48:27.080 --> 48:29.651
Quiet! An old lady speaks.

48:29.920 --> 48:32.321
My lords!

48:33.000 --> 48:36.402
I would bow, my lords,
but I'm too old for that.

48:37.320 --> 48:39.607
And you are young men.

48:40.360 --> 48:43.523
I offer you sweetcakes

48:43.920 --> 48:46.207
and the best wine

48:46.640 --> 48:48.927
from the vineyards
of our kindred.

48:52.520 --> 48:55.603
You'd feed an army that's
crucifying your own people?

48:56.360 --> 48:59.762
I'd offer you ambrosia
from the gods of Mount Olympus

48:59.920 --> 49:03.811
and conjure up dancing
girls and woodland nymphs

49:04.800 --> 49:08.327
if you would spare these
children of my father's house.

49:08.680 --> 49:13.402
If you tell me these men
are not bandits and thieves,

49:14.440 --> 49:15.521
I'll believe you.

49:15.760 --> 49:19.082
They've been in
Alexandria seven years.

49:19.360 --> 49:21.044
They're craftsmen.

49:21.200 --> 49:25.091
I received a letter
only a month ago

49:25.520 --> 49:28.524
that tells of their
plan to come here.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.529
You know we have to
put down this rebellion.

49:44.600 --> 49:48.400
It's good wine.
It's very good wine.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.530
For the life of my family,
would I give you bad wine?

49:54.320 --> 49:55.401
Take it.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.081
Take it with you.

50:01.200 --> 50:03.771
It's a hard thing
you have to do.

50:05.480 --> 50:06.641
Yes.

50:11.440 --> 50:12.680
We leave this village as it is.

50:17.080 --> 50:18.844
I thank you, grandmother.

50:20.680 --> 50:23.445
The Lord bless you and keep you.

50:25.440 --> 50:29.650
The Lord make his face to shine
upon you and be gracious unto you.

50:30.040 --> 50:33.806
The Lord lift up
his countenance upon you!

50:35.880 --> 50:38.611
And give you peace.

50:40.880 --> 50:43.121
What would you know
about woodland nymphs

50:43.280 --> 50:45.567
and gods who eat ambrosia?

50:45.720 --> 50:50.328
Well, look in the boxes
of scrolls, o curious one.

50:50.720 --> 50:54.008
Do you think my father had no room
in there for Homer and Plato?

50:54.160 --> 50:56.162
Where are the rest of
the people, Old Sarah?

50:56.360 --> 50:59.921
They're hiding in the hills
in the caves, child.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.562
Or in the tunnels.
But I'm too old

51:02.640 --> 51:04.642
to go crawling through tunnels.

51:04.760 --> 51:07.286
And besides,
the Romans fear the young.

51:10.240 --> 51:12.641
Let us pray
they don't come back.

51:12.840 --> 51:15.650
They're Romans.
They're everywhere,

51:15.760 --> 51:17.444
protecting a corrupt
Jewish king.

51:17.600 --> 51:19.250
How can we pray
they don't come back?

51:19.680 --> 51:22.763
Because a messiah is born
who will save us.

51:24.400 --> 51:26.289
His star has been seen.

51:26.760 --> 51:30.048
He lives. He will deliver us.

51:36.840 --> 51:39.002
Amen!

51:39.440 --> 51:40.885
Ooh. Mmm.

51:41.360 --> 51:44.045
Son! Are you here?

51:49.640 --> 51:53.326
There you are. You're all alone.

51:53.920 --> 51:56.446
I was praying- And playing-

51:56.600 --> 51:59.888
I'm sorry. I was
supposed to help James.

52:00.600 --> 52:02.728
I think he's climbing
a tree somewhere.

52:04.680 --> 52:05.886
Sit.

52:14.160 --> 52:17.209
I know this isn't Alexandria.
Do you miss it?

52:17.600 --> 52:19.648
No. Do you?

52:19.920 --> 52:21.365
I don't think of it like that.

52:22.440 --> 52:24.807
But it was the only home
that you ever knew.

52:25.960 --> 52:28.327
And this is
so quiet and isolated.

52:29.240 --> 52:32.403
We're safe here. No one
knows what I've done.

52:34.240 --> 52:36.083
And you must never tell anyone.

52:37.480 --> 52:39.642
I know you have many questions.

52:40.240 --> 52:43.084
But you need to let them
sleep in your heart for now.

52:43.960 --> 52:45.291
Why?

52:48.400 --> 52:52.803
Because your questions
are the questions of a child.

52:53.600 --> 52:55.329
But the answers

52:56.280 --> 52:57.770
are the answers for a man.

53:08.400 --> 53:10.528
That is one bridge
I cannot build.

53:12.080 --> 53:13.161
I don't know how.

53:16.600 --> 53:19.001
But God can,
and we must trust him.

53:19.360 --> 53:21.761
I do. I trust him
for everything.

53:33.200 --> 53:34.440
My boy.

54:22.760 --> 54:23.841
Sit.

54:25.760 --> 54:27.569
Yes, my king.

54:39.440 --> 54:42.330
I give you your mission,
and where are you?

54:42.720 --> 54:46.361
Out crucifying rebels
like some common Roman.

54:47.200 --> 54:48.964
- I am vulnerable!

54:51.400 --> 54:53.004
Do you not see that?

54:53.080 --> 54:54.605
Yes, my Lord, I understand.

54:57.360 --> 54:58.600
It's difficult.

54:59.160 --> 55:00.650
Where's the boy?

55:04.960 --> 55:06.724
Where's the boy?

55:10.200 --> 55:12.362
I can't question
every 7-year-old in Israel.

55:13.200 --> 55:15.202
Ahhh! I don't want
every 7-year-old!

55:17.160 --> 55:18.446
I want one 7-year-old.

55:21.480 --> 55:22.925
One.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.445
A man came to me today

55:27.520 --> 55:30.205
with the story of a boy
that age born in Bethlehem.

55:32.960 --> 55:34.610
He heard a rumor
we were looking for one.

55:35.480 --> 55:36.561
Where is he?

55:38.360 --> 55:39.930
I had him crucified.

55:48.240 --> 55:49.685
Seleni...

55:50.600 --> 55:51.601
Oh...

55:52.480 --> 55:54.289
Come with me. Come.

55:54.880 --> 55:56.370
He's down the road.

55:58.280 --> 56:00.089
He's probably still alive.

56:02.520 --> 56:03.601
Come.

56:15.440 --> 56:18.967
This boy,
where was his family heading?

56:19.800 --> 56:21.484
He's just like his father.

56:21.720 --> 56:23.131
Who? The boy?

56:23.200 --> 56:24.850
Herod.

56:27.040 --> 56:29.327
I'll give you water.
Give him water!

56:30.840 --> 56:33.161
So I can suffer longer?

56:34.160 --> 56:35.730
What then?

56:42.960 --> 56:43.961
Uh-huh.

56:45.360 --> 56:48.728
North. That's all I remember.

56:49.840 --> 56:51.842
Some little town.

56:54.720 --> 56:55.881
Near Galilee?

56:55.960 --> 56:57.041
Aye.

56:58.640 --> 57:01.689
I gave the boy a toy camel.

57:07.160 --> 57:09.049
Why did you go to Herod?

57:09.120 --> 57:11.691
Reward. Blood money.

57:16.560 --> 57:18.244
Don't make me wait.

57:55.400 --> 57:58.324
Brother, you won't mind if I teach
him a thing or two myself, will you?

57:58.400 --> 58:00.528
Since I was almost a scribe.

58:00.680 --> 58:03.286
Your uncle has always
been very imaginative.

58:07.800 --> 58:11.282
These are our sons, Rabbi. It's
time to resume their education.

58:14.560 --> 58:19.441
I know James, your cousin
whom you adopted, but

58:19.960 --> 58:23.248
who is this? Jesus bar Joseph.
He's my son.

58:23.920 --> 58:27.606
Everyone here
remembers your betrothal.

58:29.080 --> 58:32.448
There are other things
we also remember.

58:33.280 --> 58:37.444
The morning your betrothed, young
Mary, came out of the house,

58:37.920 --> 58:41.970
crying about an angel,
upsetting the village.

58:44.400 --> 58:48.610
Rabbi, is it not for his father
to tell him these things in time?

58:49.560 --> 58:50.925
Where was he born?

58:51.000 --> 58:52.331
Bethlehem.

58:52.720 --> 58:54.449
The City of David.

58:54.960 --> 58:58.089
And then you went
to Egypt, I understand.

58:58.240 --> 59:00.402
They have good
rabbis there, too.

59:09.160 --> 59:11.481
Same old Cleopas.

59:16.920 --> 59:19.969
Look at me, Jesus bar Joseph.

59:21.360 --> 59:24.921
Why did the Phoenicians
cut the hair of Samson?

59:25.120 --> 59:28.408
Forgive me, Rabbi, but it
was not the Phoenicians.

59:28.960 --> 59:33.284
It was the Philistines, and they
cut his hair to make him weak.

59:33.600 --> 59:37.685
Where is Elisha who was
taken up in the chariot?

59:37.880 --> 59:40.167
It was Elijah who was taken up.

59:40.480 --> 59:42.323
Elijah's with the Lord.

59:42.480 --> 59:44.528
Who resides in
the Garden of Eden?

59:44.840 --> 59:47.844
No one. There is no one in Eden.

59:51.440 --> 59:53.841
There is no one
in Eden writing this

59:53.920 --> 59:56.526
and all the deeds
of the world down?

59:56.640 --> 59:59.644
Men say it is Enoch,
but Eden is empty,

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.203
until the Lord says all the
world will be Eden again.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.962
Why did the Lord break his
covenant with King David?

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:10.482
The Lord does not break his covenants.
The throne is there.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.483
Where is the King? He will come.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.244
And his house will last forever.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.042
Will a carpenter build it?

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.211
Yes. There's always a carpenter.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.086
Even the Lord himself
is a carpenter sometimes.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.369
How is the Lord a carpenter?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.001
Tell me.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:34.966
Didn't the Lord himself tell
Noah how to build the ark?

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:38.450
What kind of wood to use,
and how it should be pitched?

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.290
And wasn't it the Lord

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.445
who granted the vision of the
new Temple to Prophet Ezekiel

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.890
with the dimensions of the
galleries, the gates, the altar?

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.563
Yes, it was.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.571
And when the Lord
made the world,

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.166
wasn't wisdom there
like a master craftsman?

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.090
If wisdom is not the Lord,
what is wisdom?

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.402
And when Cyrus
the Persian decreed

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.443
that we could
return to our Holy Land,

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.371
the carpenters came home
to build the Temple

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.846
as the Lord said
it should be built.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.967
And how...

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.847
This is a good child.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:20.971
I like this child.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.205
School tomorrow morning.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.601
Ah...

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.011
<i>Let me edify you.</i>

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.727
Whilst Mary was
weaving the veils

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.450
for the Holy of Holies
in Jerusalem,

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:50.924
I studied with the Pharisees.
Some of the best ones, too.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.330
And some maybe not so good.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:54.845
Like some of the students.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.170
Sometimes I amaze myself
at what I might have done...

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.241
Son?

01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.926
...had I not
gone off to Egypt.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.126
Son, are you all right?

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.484
Your hand, it's very warm.
Son! Son!

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:09.645
I think I could've been a prophet.
Joseph, what do you...

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.084
It's the fever. Riba,
get more water and rags.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.760
Dear God,
heal my child, I beg you.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.529
May your love and compassion
shine upon your blessed child

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.682
and spare him from suffering.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.731
Please forgive the sins
for we have this day.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.607
Send a word
from his righteous path...

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.570
You are no child.

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.160
Who are you?

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.885
Why don't you dwell

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.730
in the house of
the Lord in Jerusalem?

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.089
Answer me!

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.602
You don't know the answers.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.406
You don't know what's
going to happen, do you?

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.447
You don't know
how it's going to end.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.400
Who are you?

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.285
I demand you tell me!
Don't touch me!

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.124
Never, ever lay
your hands on me.

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:16.410
Or what, angel child?

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.929
I'll drop dead?

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.006
Let me show you
your precious Jerusalem

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.920
last Passover.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.445
ls that it?

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.603
Is that all you can do?

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:59.370
I'm watching you, angel boy.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.804
So, go on, walk like a child,

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.841
talk like a Child,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.642
play like a child
when I'm watching.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:18.001
I may not know the future,
but I know this.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:24.325
Your mother's a whore.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:29.410
Your father's a liar.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:36.240
And the floors of
your house are dirt.

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.041
Your cause is lost.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:48.281
Every day and every hour
it's lost, and you know it.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:53.650
Your little miracles can't
save these foolish people.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:57.888
I tell you, chaos rules!

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.804
And I am its prince!

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.646
What are you doing out of bed?

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.881
I'm all better.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.686
You have to rest.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.250
No.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.885
I want to go to
Jerusalem for Passover.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.090
It's dangerous.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.564
Herod, the Romans,

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.442
Jerusalem, the Temple.

01:06:57.720 --> 01:06:59.768
It's been purified.
It's calm for now.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:02.567
There's no time.
We haven't prepared.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.965
We can manage it.

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:17.249
That's not all I mean.
I'm not prepared.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:25.523
This path that he's on,
I don't know where it leads,

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.127
except that his enemies
will be there.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.963
Such fierce enemies.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.203
Why did God choose me?

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.842
What if I'm not strong enough?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.048
You're the brave
and shining girl

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.088
who protected her
infant son from an army

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.322
that was dedicated
to murdering him.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.290
It is they who should fear you.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.688
You've taken on so much.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:29.010
That you married me and took Jesus
as your son truly is a miracle.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.167
One that only
God will ever know.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:37.885
Not really,

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.850
except for me.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:52.563
I thank God
for choosing me every day.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.720
Every day.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.845
We're going, Sarah. We're going
to Jerusalem for Passover.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.567
Yes, yes, as you must.

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:36.482
Thank you. Come on, brother!

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:40.087
Let's go! Before my naptime.

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:10.122
Was there a boy about seven
or eight years old with them?

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.651
Yes, there was.

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:12.960
When was this?

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.971
Just after the uprising
in Sepphoris. We were

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.126
establishing order.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.763
It's a bloody business,

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.044
- establishing order.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.964
And what of this family?
Did you establish order?

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.000
They appeared innocent.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.325
We left them untouched.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.561
Was that before or after
they gave you the wine?

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.921
Hmm?

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.050
Your own men
won't even lie for you.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.684
We're going. Move!

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.089
Back for more cakes and wine?

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.760
We're looking for the family
recently arrived from Egypt.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.889
Gone to Jerusalem for Passover.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.405
Is the boy with them?

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:36.444
We have many boys in our family.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.169
The boy born in Bethlehem.
The boy who's seven.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.450
If my memory serves,

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.326
all the boys that age
born in Bethlehem

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:52.006
were slaughtered
by Herod's soldiers.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:56.571
Or perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps
they were Roman soldiers.

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.241
Perhaps they seek a boy
because they ran out of girls.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:05.241
There are plenty of girls.
Plenty.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.328
And children die easily.
What's the name?

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.921
What's the boy's name?

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.245
Jesus bar Joseph.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:29.131
Jesus bar Joseph of Nazareth.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.770
What have I done?

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.169
Who is this child?

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.320
Tell me, who is he?

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.123
I asked Father about going
to Jerusalem for Passover, too.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.646
Then you ask,
and suddenly we all go.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.849
I didn't know that.

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.524
There's plenty you don't know.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.167
You're the only one
who really matters.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.767
That's not true.
Everybody loves you.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.849
I'm mean. You're not mean to me.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.920
Yes I am! I hated you
when you were born.

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.722
I hated you
before you were born.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.169
Everything changed.

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.842
There were angels and three nobles.
The ones in Bethlehem.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.726
<i>These three noblemen from
the east arrived to see you.</i>

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.243
<i>Everyone in Bethlehem
saw them come.</i>

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:01.366
<i>They believed in magic.
They read stars.</i>

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:05.003
<i>And they advised the kings of
Persia what they should do.</i>

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.730
<i>They said they followed
a great star in the heavens</i>

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.482
<i>to that house
where we were staying.</i>

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:16.165
<i>They called you king, and their
servants laid gifts in front of you.</i>

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:21.040
<i>Gold and other things.
I don't remember.</i>

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.801
Looks like you two found
something to talk about.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.367
Here. Have some water.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.202
A little shower would
be nice to cool off.

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.049
Come on, on your feet now.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.641
So why did we have
to leave Bethlehem?

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.010
Don't ask me anymore.

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.650
Thanks for talking to me.

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:20.850
Don't make it rain.
I know you can.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:28.681
I told you not to!

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.331
I didn't. I didn't!

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:32.926
Come on!

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:55.127
Father!

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.527
I found a cave.

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.801
Travelers!

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.483
We seek a family from
Nazareth, with a boy of seven

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.490
named Jesus bar Joseph.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.164
If you know such a family,
and you know this child,

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:30.966
then tell us

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.207
and Rome will reward you.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.840
They know who we are and where
we're from. They're offering money.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.928
- We have to turn around.
- But we can't go home.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.207
If they don't find us in
Jerusalem, they'll go to Nazareth.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.645
We'll live in caves.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.165
I hate living in caves! Shh.

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.722
She's right. We can't go.

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.407
She's just a woman.

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.686
And she's right!

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:29.408
Tomorrow we go back.
The Essenes will help us.

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.245
We can find a way.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.082
Not the Essenes.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:38.245
At least the Romans are rational, you
can deal with them, but the Essenes?

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:43.247
They live in the wilderness
with hyenas and crazy people.

01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:47.206
Maybe it's the water or too much
sun on their hairy heads, but...

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.166
Lord Father in heaven,
guide me on this path.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:11.968
Watch over my family
and calm their hearts.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:16.006
When I enter your temple,
please take my questions

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.687
that I might
receive your answers.

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.688
Your will be done. Amen.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.521
Well?

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.451
He's gone. Gone?

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.004
Could someone have taken him?

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.206
That's impossible.

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.206
We were here.

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.609
I could've told you he'd go!

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.571
Because you decided
to turn back!

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:17.122
He wants answers,
and you won't give him any!

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:25.249
That's why he wants
to go for Passover.

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:47.487
We have to find him.
Mary and I will go ahead.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.562
The rest of you
follow with the pack animals.

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:40.680
You there with the donkey.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.807
Name. Eli.

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:47.327
Where are you from?

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:48.401
Jericho.

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.005
Your name.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.047
Name!

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.246
He can't speak.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.410
He's been that way since birth.

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:10.323
Go. Go to your temple.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.207
You are alone?

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.050
It's all I can give you.

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:42.321
God be with you
and watch over you.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.611
Thank you.

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.766
This bird is no good.
I tell you, no good!

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.649
The priest won't accept it.
It's flawed.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.326
I don't have any more money.
Please, I need to exchange it.

01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:40.760
Come on,
get away from here.

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.286
How can you cheat me
in the Temple in front of God?

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:45.124
I have to have a sacrifice!

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:49.763
Little boy, do you want a bird?
A flawed bird!

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:51.281
Huh?

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.442
Do you want it? Yes.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.521
Anything else?

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.481
It's no good, you know.

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:21.964
It can fly. Tell it to a rabbi.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.481
Where are they?

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.007
Over there,
in Solomon's Portico.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.122
This time I want one that
is unblemished. Do you hear me?

01:24:58.520 --> 01:24:59.681
He's here.

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.205
He's in the Temple.

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:03.767
The Spirit of
the Lord will be with him

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:09.600
to give him understanding,
wisdom and insight.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.607
He will be powerful.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.685
And he will know
and honor the Lord.

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.206
His greatest joy
will be to obey the Lord.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.443
Yes! We have
a real student here.

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:27.604
Now, isn't that wonderful!
Come. Sit.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.001
Ah...

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:39.602
Tell me, what does
a boy want with me?

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:41.921
Mmm?

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.602
Rabbi, about seven years ago...
Mmm-hmm.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:51.009
...a boy was born
in a stable in Bethlehem.

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.201
Three magi came from the east
and gave him gifts.

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.125
Yes, I know this tale well.

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.642
What happened to
the boy after that?

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.450
No one talks about it.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.568
Why do you want to know?
It's all I can think of.

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.210
It's why I've come
from Nazareth.

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.811
It's as you said.

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:21.848
Those three magi
visited Old Herod,

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.161
the one they called
Herod the Great.

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.051
He told those three kings

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:29.646
to return once they had
found the child.

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:32.720
The magi
never returned to Herod.

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.251
However,

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.682
<i>when Herod found out
that he had been deceived</i>

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.442
<i>and that they had found the
child, he went into a rage.</i>

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.925
<i>Such a rage, beyond hell.</i>

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.283
He sent his soldiers in the night...

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.244
...to kill every child
under two.

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:06.211
<i>Not one survived. Not one.</i>

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:12.164
<i>Think of it, an army of men
to slaughter infants.</i>

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.725
Son, it's over.

01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.487
It's a long time ago.

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:27.886
I should never have told you. I forgot
you're such a little boy with a heart.

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.041
Here, son, take it.

01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.648
He's here. Where?

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.442
What did you say? Nothing.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:54.809
The boy, he's here.

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.291
He's yours.

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:04.005
By the blind rabbi. Look.

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:07.921
Go!

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.769
Thank you, Rabbi.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:29.961
I'll remember you.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:33.602
Here? Outside.

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.644
We'll do it quietly.

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:14.401
A miracle! It's a miracle.
I can see!

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:15.960
What's the matter?

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.605
I can see!

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.205
Praise God!

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:22.203
God, I can see!

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.761
The boy...

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.841
Where's the boy? Where is he?

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:32.766
Is it you? And you?

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:38.846
Out.

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:57.047
He was here!
He was here beside me.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:02.043
Please, help me find the boy.
The boy was here!

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.441
Did you do that?

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.130
Yes.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:07.966
Who are you?

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:10.688
You saved me once before.

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:18.091
It was you.

01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:21.049
You were also at Bethlehem.

01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.083
How could you know that?

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.764
Is that him? Ls that the boy?

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.401
No, no, no, no. It's not him.
Keep looking, keep looking.

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:34.570
On your way!
Go on, it's not him.

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:36.570
Severus! Severus!

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.922
Back! Back! Back!

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.200
Go on! Go on! Away!

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:41.241
It's not him!

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.482
Keep looking!
On your way. Go! Go!

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.324
Son! Son! That's my son!

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:04.166
Son!

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:17.609
I've come to take him home.

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:22.806
Let us out!
Let us out of the Temple!

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:26.885
Romans,
leave our temple! Leave us!

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.645
Romans,
out of our temple!

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:39.201
Go.

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:42.566
All of you.

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:49.721
Go.

01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:43.160
<i>He's dead.</i>

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:45.410
I killed him.

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:46.891
You killed him?

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:50.688
I wanted to meet
this miracle worker.

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.762
The Son of Man, the...

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.251
The Wonder-Counselor,
the Prince of Peace.

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:04.129
The little boy who can make the
dead breathe and the blind see.

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.288
Why did you kill him, Centurion?

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:08.921
Your orders.

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.125
Your orders.

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:16.489
You said it was like...

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:18.446
Like Bethlehem.

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:24.685
How did you do it?

01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:31.967
Strangling?
Knife under the ribs?

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:33.930
Head against a rock?

01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:37.804
Did the thunder come?

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:41.683
Did the heavens weep?

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.445
Did you hear that?

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.331
What, sir? That.

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:52.485
That. Can't you hear that?

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:55.369
Hear what? That hissing!

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:58.530
It's a serpent or a snake!

01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:00.490
There's no snake. There is!

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:15.402
There is. Of course there is.
I need useful men around me!

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:27.362
I was just 14
when you were born.

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.090
A girl really.

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:32.369
Tell me about the angel.

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.331
Of course.
I knew you'd ask that.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.163
But listen well, because I'm only
going to tell this story once.

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.570
I was a good girl,

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:58.405
strictly raised
and betrothed to Joseph.

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:06.089
When one morning
my room filled with light.

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:12.204
It was white light

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:16.926
like the sun,
but with no heat or pain.

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:21.964
It was pure

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:27.084
like the air itself was glowing.

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.969
I saw a figure

01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.366
larger than a man, but like
a man, inside the light.

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.842
And it spoke to me. It said,

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.607
"Hail, Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee."

01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:57.720
I had found favor with the Lord,
and I was blessed among women.

01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:02.766
It said that from my womb
would come a son.

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:09.806
You.

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.325
Named Jesus.

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:26.970
This is nice.

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:31.964
You're getting so big we won't
be able to do this much longer.

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.122
Go on with the story.

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:39.401
Oh...

01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:43.326
I said I had
never been with a man.

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:48.807
So the angel said that the Holy
Spirit would come over me,

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.686
and that I would give
birth to a Holy Child.

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:57.486
I answered,
"I am a servant of the Lord."

01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.964
"Let it be done."

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.566
What did Joseph say?

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:07.050
Yes, that was a worry.

01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:11.209
But an angel also came to him
and told him everything.

01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:15.727
Then, is the angel...

01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:19.683
No. No.

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.042
The angel is not your father.

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.765
God is.

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:35.409
God is your father.

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.407
But we're all children of God.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.049
Yes. Yes, we are.

01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.011
<i>But you...</i>

01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.249
You are begotten of God.

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:56.686
That is why you can
make dead birds fly,

01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:01.446
the sick well, the blind see,

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:05.605
and why you were able
to make Eleazer live again.

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:15.365
He's made you a child
to grow in wisdom

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.442
as well as in all other things.

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:25.206
Keep your power inside you,

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:28.727
until your father in heaven
shows you the time to use it.

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.562
He did not give you to a scribe

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.048
a rabbi or a king.

01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:42.804
He gave you to Joseph bar
Jacob, the carpenter,

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.009
and me, his betrothed,

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:49.481
to raise you until that time.

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:11.161
<i>I've learned so much
since leaving Egypt.</i>

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:14.486
<i>I know everything
I can for today.</i>

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.048
<i>I even know I'm going to die.</i>

01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.850
<i>I used to wonder
if angels would come to me,</i>

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:26.849
<i>if they would sing to me,</i>

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:30.042
<i>if they would fill my dreams.</i>

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:34.009
<i>There is still so
much that I don't know,</i>

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.688
<i>but I do know this.</i>

01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:42.651
<i>I don't think I'm here to see
angels or to hear them sing.</i>

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:45.970
<i>And I don't think I'm here</i>

01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:50.489
<i>to make it rainy or sunny
or anything like that.</i>

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:54.929
<i>I think I'm here
just to be alive.</i>

01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:00.649
<i>To see it, hear it, feel it,</i>

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:03.041
<i>all of it.</i>

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:07.885
<i>Even when it hurts.</i>

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:12.330
<i>Someday you will tell me
why else I'm here.</i>

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.004
<i>I don't know when, but you will.</i>

01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:20.046
<i>I know that.</i>

01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.765
<i>Because, Father,</i>

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.450
<i>I am your child.</i>
