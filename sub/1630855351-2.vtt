00:10.907 --> 00:13.367
You're using the new bread when
we haven't finished the old bread?

00:13.367 --> 00:17.872
- I want fresh.
- We'll throw the old bread away then.

00:19.207 --> 00:22.792
Bye, money.
Mr. Fancy likes his fresh.

00:23.168 --> 00:25.838
What are you even doing home?
Shouldn't you be at church?

00:26.254 --> 00:29.257
- Don't you have like a job to go to?
- They didn't need me to come in today.

00:29.257 --> 00:33.261
But you stayed home yesterday too.
Something going on at work, huh?

00:33.261 --> 00:39.935
- 'Cause this, this is unusual.
- No. Yes. I got fired, okay?

00:40.436 --> 00:44.439
- Well, not fired. Let go.
- What? Why did they fire you?

00:44.857 --> 00:48.527
- They didn't fire me. I was let go.
- Why were you let you go?

00:48.527 --> 00:50.863
No reasons. Just cutbacks.

00:51.948 --> 00:55.116
You're doing cocaine again,
aren't you, Stephen? Don't lie to me.

00:55.116 --> 00:57.953
- Always find a way to bring that up.
- Oh, my God! You are!

00:57.953 --> 01:02.333
- You are going back to rehab!
- No! I'm never going back there!

01:02.333 --> 01:04.876
I should have seen the signs.
Your weird behavior.

01:04.876 --> 01:07.713
Now, you're fired from church. Then
you said that mean thing about my hair.

01:07.713 --> 01:12.260
Oh, my God. Again, with the hair.
We already fought about the hair.

01:12.260 --> 01:18.724
I'm sorry I don't like your haircut.
It looks fucking stupid. Get over it!

01:18.724 --> 01:24.564
My hair is age appropriate. Unlike you,
trying to look young with frosted tips.

01:24.564 --> 01:26.231
You look old and desperate.

01:26.231 --> 01:30.026
You're thinking you're some hot
rock star doing coke. It's sad.

01:30.986 --> 01:32.363
Fuck you.

01:32.363 --> 01:36.283
Telling your wife fuck you
under your breath. Pathetic.

01:36.283 --> 01:39.244
An unemployed, cokehead
piece of shit who sulks all day.

01:39.244 --> 01:42.831
Can't even support his kids. But don't
worry! He still wears ripped jeans

01:42.831 --> 01:46.586
and spends all day learning Kings
From Leon like a goddamn teenage idiol.

01:46.586 --> 01:48.671
You want to push my buttons? Fine.

01:48.671 --> 01:54.135
Let me tell it to you loud and clear so
you can hear me. Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:57.930 --> 02:02.477
- Daddy!
- I'm okay. I'm okay, honey.

02:05.146 --> 02:06.313
Fuck!

02:34.466 --> 02:37.053
Ooh, cha-cha-cha. Busted.

02:39.430 --> 02:43.768
Gideon, when did you even start this
nasty habit? Not in this house, I pray.

02:43.768 --> 02:46.812
No. You're in the clear, Mommy.
I picked it up on set.

02:46.812 --> 02:48.480
I'm not happy you got hurt,

02:48.480 --> 02:51.149
but I am glad that you are no longer
hanging out with these types of people.

02:51.149 --> 02:54.277
Quit smoking. And your sarcasm
needs to go right along with it.

02:54.277 --> 02:58.323
- Calling me mommy. No, sir.
- Sorry. I don't know why I did that.

02:58.323 --> 03:01.284
Buddy, we need a favor from you.
You need to start pitching in,

03:01.284 --> 03:04.372
especially since you're sitting on your
ass all day not doing movies anymore.

03:04.372 --> 03:07.707
- Dad, I don't wanna preach.
- Well, I'm not asking you to preach.

03:08.583 --> 03:10.586
I need you
to fill in for my daddy's driver.

03:10.586 --> 03:13.089
I'm sick and tired of seeing you
moping around the house all day,

03:13.089 --> 03:15.590
pretending like you're fucking born
on the Fourth of July or something.

03:15.590 --> 03:18.593
I'm sitting around
'cause I've been seriously injured.

03:18.593 --> 03:23.724
And I am moping. I can't do anything.
I can't ride bikes, do my martial arts.

03:23.724 --> 03:29.896
- I may never do stunts again.
- You're never gonna do stunts again.

03:29.896 --> 03:33.483
- Never gonna do stunts again?
- We're not trying to belittle you.

03:33.483 --> 03:36.028
But this might be what you need.
Get out in the world.

03:36.028 --> 03:39.698
Run your granddaddy around to get
his meds, get his prostate checked.

03:39.698 --> 03:42.534
- It could take your mind off of shit.
- How often does he check his prostate?

03:42.534 --> 03:44.494
- Bunches.
- Lot of times. It gets bigger.

03:44.494 --> 03:47.957
You're doing it,
so don't be a little bitch about it.

04:09.186 --> 04:12.398
- Daytime friends and nighttime lovers.
- Turn it off.

04:12.982 --> 04:16.234
Hoping no one else discovers
where they go.

04:16.234 --> 04:19.238
Stop grabbing my hand
and turn it the fuck off.

04:19.238 --> 04:21.199
Just don't act like
you don't love hearing our song.

04:21.199 --> 04:24.327
Shut up. This ain't our song.
We don't have a song.

04:25.327 --> 04:29.415
- What's up with your face?
- My wife laid these colors down.

04:29.415 --> 04:33.293
- God dang. What happened?
- I told her I got fired.

04:33.293 --> 04:36.631
But I couldn't tell her why.
She thinks I'm back on coke.

04:36.964 --> 04:38.800
That's great news.

04:39.132 --> 04:43.012
She's demanding I go back to rehab.
It's all fucked!

04:43.970 --> 04:49.309
Earth to Stephen. Come back
from outer space and calm down.

04:49.811 --> 04:53.021
Don't you think I've thought
about all this? I have.

04:53.856 --> 04:58.402
That's why I'm prepared
to give you $10,000.

04:58.402 --> 05:03.241
That's mostly in small bills. I figured
you'd wanna buy gas station snack.

05:03.241 --> 05:07.035
- So this is fuck off money?
- A little bit may, kinda.

05:07.035 --> 05:09.955
I'm not giving up that easy
and letting the other guy win.

05:09.955 --> 05:12.416
- What other guy?
- Your husband.

05:12.416 --> 05:16.921
- I'm willing to fight for you.
- You don't sound like a tattoo man.

05:16.921 --> 05:20.091
Stephen, you have a wife.
You have kids.

05:20.091 --> 05:23.761
We haven't even shit
in front of each other.

05:23.761 --> 05:26.180
- But I want to.
- Don't.

05:26.180 --> 05:30.935
I'd leave my family in a second
if I can have you. I'd murder them.

05:31.476 --> 05:33.479
I believe you, okay?

05:33.479 --> 05:37.817
I have long known that I can drive
men wild with the power of this pussy

05:37.817 --> 05:40.778
or even just the promise
of this pussy.

05:40.778 --> 05:46.199
But marriage-ruining shit, home-wrecker
shit, that's a hell no from me, dawg.

05:46.199 --> 05:50.370
Me and you?
I don't want to see you no mo.

05:50.997 --> 05:56.877
Judy. Wait. Don't, don't do this.

06:09.182 --> 06:11.517
All right, Gideon,
go on and keep that speed steady.

06:11.517 --> 06:14.520
Daddy don't like it too fast.
He's doing good, ain't he, Daddy?

06:14.520 --> 06:18.190
- Fine. Thank you, Gideon.
- Happy to help, Granddad.

06:24.238 --> 06:27.867
Why is the injured person doing the
driving? He can't even turn his head.

06:27.867 --> 06:30.911
Maybe help him out instead
of being a damn dick about it.

06:31.244 --> 06:32.746
- You're clear.
- All good?

06:32.746 --> 06:35.207
Yeah. You're good.
Put your signal on.

06:35.207 --> 06:38.961
I don't even know why we came all the
way out here. We hate Montgomerys.

06:38.961 --> 06:41.588
Here we are, doing a damn
wellness check for our sworn enemies.

06:41.588 --> 06:45.300
Momma wouldn't like it.
She'd say fuck these inbred weirdoes.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.386
Your mom will never say
anything like that about your cousins.

06:48.386 --> 06:50.597
I always found them
to be kind of dumb and strange.

06:50.597 --> 06:52.682
That's why I'm surprised you
weren't butt buddies with them.

06:52.682 --> 06:55.436
- Oh, yeah, Judy?
- You wanna talk butt buddies?

06:55.810 --> 06:59.232
Why don't you go back on tour then?
Get some kisses.

06:59.232 --> 07:01.274
- Stop.
- Work on a new love song.

07:01.274 --> 07:04.611
- What are you all talking about?
- Nothing, Daddy. Nothing. Stop it!

07:04.611 --> 07:07.824
- Gideon, turn left here.
- Yeah.

07:32.180 --> 07:34.934
They're waiting for you down
at the mess hall. Stay to the left.

07:34.934 --> 07:37.060
Do not veer off the road.

07:40.356 --> 07:43.359
They got damn Meal Team Six
guarding this joint.

07:43.359 --> 07:46.820
- What the hell is this place, Daddy?
- It's some straight up militia shit.

07:46.820 --> 07:50.740
These folks are what you call preppers.
They believe the end is near.

07:50.740 --> 07:54.077
They wanna make sure
they don't run out of toilet paper.

08:02.628 --> 08:04.589
Let's go! Move, move, move!

08:26.694 --> 08:29.155
- Gideon, what are you doing?
- Oh, honestly, I have no idea.

08:29.155 --> 08:32.324
- Do I go with you or stay in the car?
- You're his driver. What do you think?

08:32.324 --> 08:36.953
- Right. So it's stay with the car then?
- Bingo. Stay with the car.

08:36.953 --> 08:39.332
Daddy, you make sure he does
the stuff a driver is supposed to do.

08:39.332 --> 08:41.417
Don't give him any shortcuts
just 'cause he's family.

08:41.417 --> 08:43.084
He's fine, Jesse.

08:44.503 --> 08:45.838
All right.

08:52.178 --> 08:56.473
Uncle. Cousins. Welcome.

09:07.735 --> 09:10.654
- What are you doing here, Uncle?
- Your mother is worried about you.

09:11.239 --> 09:13.950
Wanna make sure
you all are staying out of trouble.

09:13.950 --> 09:17.160
Momma don't know shit.
She hadn't in a long time.

09:17.160 --> 09:22.208
I can't argue with that, but looking
around I say she may be getting warmer.

09:22.583 --> 09:24.293
Who are these men
you're out here with?

09:24.293 --> 09:26.586
These are the Brothers
of Tomorrow's Fires.

09:26.586 --> 09:31.091
- This is a militia.
- It was a bad idea to come out here.

09:31.091 --> 09:33.343
I ain't trying to get Ruby Ridged
up in this motherfucker.

09:33.343 --> 09:37.264
Feds come rushing in and we get fucking
Waco'd while sitting here. No, sir.

09:37.264 --> 09:39.975
- What are you all up to?
- There's a war coming.

09:39.975 --> 09:42.395
The Lord has picked
how He'll use each of us.

09:42.395 --> 09:46.523
I know my assignment. Do you
know how He intends to use you?

09:46.523 --> 09:48.316
- Yeah. Singing.
- Yeah. Doing preaching.

09:48.316 --> 09:50.361
Youth of ministry probably.

09:53.739 --> 09:56.950
If it ain't the world-famous
Gemstone family.

09:58.743 --> 10:01.121
- Hello, Peter.
- Eli...

10:01.121 --> 10:04.292
- And little old Karl.
- Hi, Uncle Eli.

10:05.417 --> 10:09.337
I mean, good afternoon, sir. Cousins.

10:10.088 --> 10:13.926
Got the whole family here.
To what do we owe the pleasure?

10:13.926 --> 10:18.180
I don't suppose my lovely, forgiving
wife had anything to do with the visit?

10:18.180 --> 10:21.893
She may have asked me to check up on
the boys, see how you all are doing.

10:21.893 --> 10:24.395
I'd say we're doing just fine.

10:24.896 --> 10:26.814
- Doing fine, Karl?
- Yes, sir.

10:26.814 --> 10:28.941
There you go. There you have it.

10:28.941 --> 10:33.320
We're making up for lost time now
that pa is back on the outside again.

10:33.320 --> 10:37.699
Don't mean to be rude but we are
congregating for our afternoon service.

10:37.699 --> 10:42.079
Service? Are you all doing church?
Why don't you let us pray with you?

10:42.079 --> 10:45.290
- It's what we do.
- I got a good sermon in the chamber.

10:45.290 --> 10:48.168
Pop it off and lighten the mood
with these sour boys.

10:48.168 --> 10:50.671
Maybe throw a little song over to Judy.
She can do a ditty.

10:50.671 --> 10:54.925
I'm happy to. Karl's gonna have
to run security detail for me though.

10:54.925 --> 10:56.803
These boys look
like they're trying to eat me.

10:56.803 --> 11:01.015
If there's any little ones, I could do
a presentation on feats of strength.

11:01.015 --> 11:05.186
- Tie it in with Jesus.
- You're all so sure of yourselves.

11:05.186 --> 11:08.480
We do it a little differently here.

11:10.358 --> 11:12.651
Eyes to the front!

11:13.568 --> 11:17.907
Men, this here is
the world-famous Gemstone family.

11:19.075 --> 11:24.038
Eli got a magnificent ministry.
It's as big as a castle.

11:24.997 --> 11:29.794
He had a wife, beautiful wife,
with a voice of an angel.

11:29.794 --> 11:34.507
- Yes, she did.
- She just loved to share that gift.

11:37.093 --> 11:43.766
She would share it on every street
corner if she could. Just give it away.

11:47.060 --> 11:50.689
Eli here, he just had to sell it!

11:51.983 --> 11:56.487
These people, they're not here
to offer you a gift.

11:57.321 --> 12:03.703
They are here to sell you something.
I know because I bought it once!

12:06.121 --> 12:09.374
These are not people of God!

12:10.500 --> 12:15.589
They're entertainers!
Performers! Charlatans!

12:16.381 --> 12:19.594
When the end times come,
are we to believe

12:19.594 --> 12:24.055
that these phony fakers will be
called to the Kingdom of Heaven?

12:24.472 --> 12:26.601
No, sir. No.

12:28.686 --> 12:33.149
Then get the hell out of here!

12:47.412 --> 12:51.000
I can't believe we're blood with those
boys. Couldn't be kin more different.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.376
Tell me about it. They're crazy.

12:53.376 --> 12:56.922
Super relig. Love their guns.
Live in a compound together.

12:56.922 --> 12:59.884
To be honest with you, I'm embarrassed
we're even related to them.

12:59.884 --> 13:03.930
Me too. Supes embarrassed. Is this
the color we're going with here?

13:03.930 --> 13:05.473
Judy picked it.

13:05.473 --> 13:08.434
Well, since she's not here,
maybe we do a veto?

13:08.434 --> 13:11.269
Percy, if this is gonna be
our executive boardroom,

13:11.269 --> 13:14.147
I feel like I'd like my chair on
a platform or raised or something,

13:14.147 --> 13:16.567
just so I sit taller
than those around me.

13:16.567 --> 13:19.695
Jesse, that's a really good idea.
But my chair too though

13:19.695 --> 13:23.406
Okay. Percy, can you make
our chairs taller than the rest?

13:23.406 --> 13:26.243
What we're going for here is that
when people come in to meet,

13:26.243 --> 13:27.745
that they feel less.

13:27.745 --> 13:30.081
- Are you writing this down'
- Yes, boys.

13:30.081 --> 13:35.837
Jesse and Kelvin. Sorry
to interrupt. Remodeling, are we?

13:35.837 --> 13:39.422
Yes, Martin. Very important
church leaders executive stuff.

13:39.422 --> 13:44.511
Martin, your penis is 22.82
feet away from me right now.

13:45.011 --> 13:47.056
- Okay...
- Martin, what you need?

13:47.056 --> 13:51.268
The ministers from the church
have reached out.

13:51.268 --> 13:53.146
The ministers?

13:53.813 --> 13:58.651
- Percy, get the fuck out of here. Go.
- Bye, Percy.

13:58.651 --> 14:00.402
Thanks.

14:00.819 --> 14:02.737
- Which ministers?
- All of them.

14:02.737 --> 14:05.073
They want to have a meeting
with the three of you.

14:05.073 --> 14:08.703
Okay. That could be normal, right?

14:08.703 --> 14:12.748
They want to make sure that the church
is headed in the right direction.

14:12.748 --> 14:15.125
And we're supposed
to convince them of that?

14:15.125 --> 14:18.920
As the leaders of the church,
yes, that is expected.

14:18.920 --> 14:22.216
- Sick. Sick.
- Cool. Very good. No doubt.

14:22.216 --> 14:26.012
- Sick.
- It is sick. It is also bad news.

14:32.143 --> 14:36.981
- What's up, Daddy? You get any bites?
- Daddy be straight up relaxing.

14:36.981 --> 14:41.652
I am trying to relax,
but people keep bothering me.

14:41.652 --> 14:45.448
We understand you're trying to get
your chill on, catch fishes.

14:45.448 --> 14:50.076
We're not here to ask you to do
extra work and to do any hand-holding.

14:51.037 --> 14:54.957
It's just that the ministers from the
church, they'd like to have a sit-down.

14:54.957 --> 14:58.293
- What now?
- Martin says they're disgruntled.

14:58.293 --> 15:00.754
Apparently, they liked it better
when you ran the church

15:00.754 --> 15:04.549
Daddy, maybe like you could
just talk to them or something.

15:04.549 --> 15:07.178
- I'm supposed to be retired.
- Well, we understand that.

15:07.178 --> 15:10.805
I hope you know we are trying hard
not to ruin this whole entire thing.

15:10.805 --> 15:13.517
Truth be told, I don't know
how much help I can be.

15:13.517 --> 15:16.770
World's a more cynical place
than when we were coming up.

15:16.770 --> 15:20.190
People are ready to hate.
Excited to even.

15:20.190 --> 15:25.278
But the importartant thing is
that you all work this out together.

15:26.489 --> 15:30.368
- I'm not always gonna be here.
- But you're alive.

15:30.700 --> 15:34.831
You ain't drooling yet. You ain't
even squirting piss against your will.

15:35.163 --> 15:40.377
Come on, Daddy. Pretty please,
with sugar sprinkles on top.

16:12.118 --> 16:13.661
Holy shit!

16:20.042 --> 16:22.253
Oh, my God! What the...

16:25.088 --> 16:27.174
They shot him. They shot him.

16:44.025 --> 16:47.486
- What the heck happened?
- - We're being raided.
- Get to the safe...

16:49.238 --> 16:51.948
- Go, go, go!
- Oh, boy! What did he say?

16:51.948 --> 16:54.534
- Get to the safe house!
- To the safe house?

16:54.994 --> 16:58.455
That was fun. We haven't been to a
movie in I can't remember how long.

16:59.498 --> 17:03.418
It was cool having popcorn. Throwing
it at people's heads like we used to.

17:03.418 --> 17:07.547
I feel like, lately, we haven't been on
the same page, but now we're back.

17:08.007 --> 17:10.175
You think
we haven't been on the same page?

17:10.175 --> 17:13.929
No. I'm just saying like,
at various points in our relationship,

17:13.929 --> 17:17.308
we haven't been on the same page
but we're good now.

17:17.308 --> 17:20.185
- When were we not on the same page?
- God, BJ.

17:20.185 --> 17:24.898
When I was on tour, I would call you
and stuff, and you barely picked up

17:24.898 --> 17:27.526
'cause you were always at the
Salvation Center trying to kiss ass.

17:27.526 --> 17:31.696
Lollipop, the time zones were hard
to navigate while you were on tour.

17:31.696 --> 17:33.657
And I'm not kissing ass
at the Salvation Center.

17:33.657 --> 17:35.951
I'm helping out at a time
when we need it,

17:35.951 --> 17:38.328
becoming a more dope me
in the process.

17:38.328 --> 17:41.124
Fuck, BJ. I'm not trying
to play the blame game.

17:41.124 --> 17:46.044
I'm stating that we took a break and
now it's nice to spend time together.

17:47.171 --> 17:49.673
You being on tour
and me helping out at the church

17:49.673 --> 17:52.551
is not taking a break
in our relationship.

17:52.551 --> 17:57.974
God. Semantics police. Please
do not start spiraling over words.

17:58.975 --> 18:01.352
I said it weird. It's no bigz.

18:01.352 --> 18:04.439
You made it sound like we went
through a rocky patch or something.

18:04.439 --> 18:07.567
I didn't say that. You're the one over
here talking about rocky patch.

18:07.567 --> 18:10.235
I literally said I was away
and then I came back.

18:10.235 --> 18:14.574
I said two locations. That's all.
The rest is in your twisted mind.

18:14.574 --> 18:18.536
- Don't gaslight me, Judy.
- You gaslight yourself by being crazy.

18:23.166 --> 18:28.295
It's called a joke, hot stuff.
Come on, dude Lighten up.

18:29.629 --> 18:35.178
- I love you. You know that. Come on.
- Okay.

18:35.678 --> 18:37.429
- Okay?
- Sorry.

18:48.024 --> 18:49.858
Pa make it?

19:03.664 --> 19:08.795
- We made it.
- I see that. A lot of fellas didn't.

19:09.252 --> 19:11.755
- Why'd the feds come, Pa?
- I don't know.

19:11.755 --> 19:16.009
We were talking and thinking
maybe you two could tell us.

19:16.009 --> 19:19.596
Why are you asking like that? We
didn't have nothing to do with nothing.

19:19.596 --> 19:24.936
Yeah, but you invited
the Gemstones out for a visit.

19:24.936 --> 19:27.355
No, sir, we didn't.
Momma sent them.

19:27.355 --> 19:31.692
How would she even know where you
were unless you were talking to her?

19:35.154 --> 19:40.450
- What did we discuss?
- That she is a liar? Can't be trusted.

19:40.450 --> 19:42.954
Right. And did you listen?

19:44.288 --> 19:48.250
I said did you listen to me
and talk to her?

19:50.710 --> 19:53.004
Ignore me again.

19:56.008 --> 20:00.262
All right. We're gonna try this
a different way. Jacob get over here.

20:00.262 --> 20:03.139
- Why?
- Because I said so, Jacob.

20:05.059 --> 20:09.564
- Don't look at me. Don't. Get him.
- Get off! Get off me!

20:12.650 --> 20:14.819
Now, we're gonna try this again.

20:16.028 --> 20:20.115
If you lie to me, Jacob here is gonna
lose the tippy top of his ear.

20:20.115 --> 20:22.200
What? Stop!

20:22.659 --> 20:27.832
Now, did you or did you not tell
the feds where we were?

20:27.832 --> 20:31.711
- No, Pa. Honest. We didn't.
- Pa, we ain't lying. Please.

20:32.127 --> 20:34.421
Yeah, I don't believe you.

20:35.463 --> 20:38.884
- There you go! Did you see that?
- Oh, shit!

20:38.884 --> 20:43.181
You see that? That is your fault.
You caused that. Got another one.

20:43.973 --> 20:46.933
- No!
- Quiet! We're gonna do this again.

20:46.933 --> 20:50.730
Don't lie to me, boys, okay?
Jacob, I am really sorry about that.

20:50.730 --> 20:54.859
- No! You don't gotta do this!
- Stop! Stop! Don't!

20:56.486 --> 21:00.030
You are dumber than I thought
you stepping to me like that.

21:00.030 --> 21:05.119
I will not be disrespected.
You let go of me! Fuck! That hurt.

21:05.452 --> 21:07.455
Get that son of a bitch!

21:14.836 --> 21:17.340
Come back here right now! Come back!

21:17.340 --> 21:19.675
Don't stand there! Go get them!

21:31.520 --> 21:33.313
Hey, Granddad. Ready to roll?

21:33.313 --> 21:37.067
I ain't looking for Speed Racer here.
I ain't in one of your action movies.

21:37.067 --> 21:40.904
No, sir. No, of course, not.
No action movies today.

21:44.992 --> 21:48.830
Dear Lord, have you been smoking?
It reeks of cigarettes in here.

21:48.830 --> 21:51.415
Have I? Gosh, no.

21:51.415 --> 21:54.459
Honestly, off the top of my head,
the only explanation I could think is

21:54.459 --> 21:58.964
that I wore these clothes to the store
recently and another person...

21:59.549 --> 22:03.177
You don't need to lie. I can smell it.
Your grandma used to smoke.

22:03.177 --> 22:05.971
- Turn on the air.
- Sorry, Granddad. Yeah.

22:12.270 --> 22:14.855
- You're clear.
- All clear? Thanks.

22:17.983 --> 22:21.404
So how's your day going so far?

22:21.779 --> 22:26.159
I'm gonna collect my thoughts before
going to meet with these ministers.

22:26.159 --> 22:28.160
As you should. Yup.

22:33.623 --> 22:35.876
What? Where are you?

22:45.260 --> 22:47.387
Daddy ain't here yet.

22:47.387 --> 22:50.391
He was never too late for stuff
like this when he was in charge.

22:50.391 --> 22:53.351
- He's doing this on purpose.
- It's only five till.

22:53.978 --> 22:57.190
- Technically, he's not late yet.
- No. He's late.

23:02.653 --> 23:05.071
Just keep the truck running.

23:13.623 --> 23:15.832
Here. Come on, Eli. Quick!

23:17.375 --> 23:20.171
- My God. What happened?
- We got raided.

23:20.171 --> 23:23.882
Pa thinks you all are responsible.
He blamed us. Madder than a wet hen.

23:23.882 --> 23:27.552
Peter is dangerous, Eli. He's already
sent his goons to question me.

23:27.552 --> 23:31.599
They followed me here as I was
checking in. They're parked outside.

23:43.151 --> 23:44.403
Everything okay?

23:44.403 --> 23:47.906
Boy, we got friends a couple
of spaces over from you.

23:47.906 --> 23:51.119
I want you to leave the parking lot.
Drive right by them.

23:51.119 --> 23:54.539
Go around the block. There's
an alley back behind the motel.

23:54.539 --> 23:55.956
Got it.

24:00.961 --> 24:04.548
Well, if you all aren't gonna speak,
is it okay if we do then?

24:04.966 --> 24:08.302
Daddy ain't coming.
It's time. We're on our own.

24:08.803 --> 24:12.473
- Jesse, what are you doing?
- Let's fuck these pastors up.

24:12.473 --> 24:16.601
How's it going, everyone? Wonderful to
see you, brother and sister pastors.

24:16.601 --> 24:18.395
Thanks for coming out.

24:18.395 --> 24:23.234
We understand that some of you are
nervous about the change in leadership.

24:23.234 --> 24:26.444
We just wanna assure you that
we don't take that personally.

24:26.444 --> 24:30.700
We're not insulted by that. It doesn't
make us wanna physically hurt you.

24:30.700 --> 24:33.911
We just want you all to really know

24:33.911 --> 24:38.498
that we are just as capable of running
this church as our momma and daddy.

24:38.498 --> 24:40.626
And because you believed
in our parents,

24:40.626 --> 24:44.005
it is now time
to believe in their three children

24:44.005 --> 24:48.842
Being a part of Gemstone church
used to be joyous, felt like a family.

24:48.842 --> 24:50.887
But now, that spark is gone.

24:50.887 --> 24:53.639
You gotta give the people in this room
something to believe in.

24:53.639 --> 24:57.810
Inspire us. Let us know
that you feel confident in the future.

24:57.810 --> 24:59.645
All right. Easy. Cinch.

24:59.645 --> 25:03.482
- Judy.
- Oh, I'm up? Okay.

25:04.442 --> 25:06.527
I'm so ready to inspire you all,

25:06.527 --> 25:10.907
but I'm gonna be generous right now,
throw it to my, my little bro, Kelvin.

25:11.449 --> 25:14.035
- I had to be the one to inspire?
- Fucking do it.

25:14.035 --> 25:18.664
You all wanna be inspired?
Peep this.

25:19.540 --> 25:24.794
To turn this church around, it's gonna
take more than just the three of us.

25:25.879 --> 25:31.885
It's gonna take everybody in here.
We, the three, and you.

25:32.512 --> 25:38.642
Okay. What? I just stumbled
upon a new church chant motto.

25:41.019 --> 25:46.067
We, the three, and you.
Come on. We, the three, and you.

25:46.400 --> 25:49.402
- Tag along. Come on, everybody.
- We, the three, and you.

25:49.402 --> 25:52.697
- Let me hear you all.
- We, the three, and you. Come on.

25:53.699 --> 25:56.536
- This is what you got for us?
- What's that?

25:57.578 --> 26:00.288
Half the church is thinking
about jumping ship

26:00.288 --> 26:02.874
and you wanna clap hands
and rhyme?

26:02.874 --> 26:04.877
You're making us look like fools.

26:04.877 --> 26:09.590
Your hairstyle and your flavor saver
make you look like a fool, homes.

26:09.590 --> 26:12.759
- For real though.
- Very well then.

26:12.759 --> 26:18.349
After 22 years of service to this
church the Lord tells me my time is up.

26:18.891 --> 26:21.769
The Lord is telling me
you're a little baby bitch!

26:21.769 --> 26:23.812
You just sit your ass
back down right now!

26:23.812 --> 26:26.898
- Jesse, don't swear at them.
- No. No. Let him walk.

26:26.898 --> 26:31.027
- They fucking suck anyway!
- Judy! No! Come on!

26:31.027 --> 26:34.866
Please! Guys, come back.
Come back. Please. Please come back!

26:34.866 --> 26:39.077
No! Everyone just calm down.
Calm down!

26:39.077 --> 26:42.747
You tell that to them, Martin.
This is embarrassing.

26:42.747 --> 26:44.624
If their mother was still alive,

26:44.624 --> 26:48.337
she would be appalled by what's
happening in this church right now.

26:48.337 --> 26:50.630
Shut the fuck up about my momma,
you asshole!

26:51.423 --> 26:53.508
You wanna do that? All right.

26:57.095 --> 26:59.849
- I was on your side.
- Fuck this!

27:05.729 --> 27:07.772
Quit! Quit it!

27:11.151 --> 27:12.570
Come on!

27:13.446 --> 27:14.863
Hold on!

27:14.863 --> 27:17.699
- Fuck you!
- We, the three, and you!

27:20.076 --> 27:24.289
- Shit! They're going everywhere.
- Choke on this, Linda!

27:28.168 --> 27:30.046
Fuck you! Fuck off!

27:32.715 --> 27:34.550
Suck it! Fuck you!

27:43.558 --> 27:46.521
Come on, boys!
Hustle! Hustle in!

27:49.231 --> 27:50.774
Go, go!

27:52.485 --> 27:54.070
Hit it, Gideon!

28:06.498 --> 28:08.750
Oh, Lord! They spotted us.

28:09.502 --> 28:12.338
- Granddad, I'm gonna need your eyes.
- You got them.

28:12.338 --> 28:14.005
Holy shit!

28:19.095 --> 28:21.139
Clear on the right side.

28:31.649 --> 28:33.151
Hold on!

28:38.406 --> 28:40.115
Coming up fast!

28:43.286 --> 28:45.871
Oh, shit! Son of a bitch!

28:57.007 --> 28:58.509
I pooped a little.

29:06.141 --> 29:08.144
We got two of them now.

29:10.438 --> 29:13.190
- The field on your right clear?
- Clear!

29:23.701 --> 29:25.494
They're still on us.

30:03.198 --> 30:04.825
Right side.

30:06.536 --> 30:08.453
Leftside.

30:25.847 --> 30:28.182
If you got a move in you...

30:54.750 --> 30:58.461
You're a hell of a wheel man, Gideon.
Old Walker couldn't have stuck that.

30:58.461 --> 31:00.214
You can keep the gig.

31:13.770 --> 31:15.437
THE RIGHTEOUS GEMSTOMES
