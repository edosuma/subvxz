[squirrels chittering]

00:11.583 --> 00:14.250
One chance, Ghost Spider.

00:14.250 --> 00:16.250
You tell us
what really happened,

00:16.250 --> 00:18.542
and if we believe you,
we'll let you go.

00:18.542 --> 00:22.166
If we don't,
we're taking you in
for what you did to that kid.

00:22.166 --> 00:25.291
And if you have an ounce
of responsibility in--

00:25.291 --> 00:27.792
[grunts]
Can the responsibility lecture.

00:27.792 --> 00:30.917
I'm out here
trying to catch the woman
who's actually responsible.

00:30.917 --> 00:34.250
And I won't let you
or that kid from S.H.I.E.L.D.
stop me.

00:34.250 --> 00:37.709
Not yet.
If you're not the one
who hurt that boy,

00:37.709 --> 00:39.709
you need to tell us
who did.

00:39.709 --> 00:42.000
[sighs]
First off,

00:42.000 --> 00:45.291
Kevin wasn't just some boy,
he was my best friend.

00:45.291 --> 00:48.917
<i>We've been inseparable</i>
<i>since second-grade summer camp.</i>

00:48.917 --> 00:50.792
Look up, doofus.
[chuckling]

00:50.792 --> 00:52.792
Gotcha!
[laughing]

00:52.792 --> 00:55.667
<i>He was the only one</i>
<i>that knew my secret identity.</i>

00:55.667 --> 00:59.917
<i>And he was... an Inhuman.</i>

00:59.917 --> 01:02.041
<i>We found that out</i>
<i>when the Terrigen Wave hit.</i>

01:02.041 --> 01:05.041
<i>It passed over us,</i>
<i>and I thought he'd be fine.</i>

01:05.041 --> 01:07.417
<i>I was fine, but he wasn't.</i>

01:07.417 --> 01:10.375
Gwen, what's happen--

01:15.125 --> 01:19.625
<i>He had his own powers,</i>
<i>and he wanted to use them</i>
<i>for good, like me.</i>

01:21.041 --> 01:22.166
[grunting]

01:23.542 --> 01:25.291
[chuckles]
Missed again.

01:25.291 --> 01:27.333
No fair.
You keep flipping around.

01:27.333 --> 01:30.125
Fine, Hawkeye.
Hit this.

01:32.375 --> 01:34.041
No. No.

01:34.041 --> 01:36.041
No. Kevin, are you even
looking right now?

01:36.041 --> 01:38.291
[chuckles]
Try this.

01:43.291 --> 01:44.583
[panting]

01:44.583 --> 01:46.625
[grunting]
Whoa.

01:46.625 --> 01:48.750
Impressive.
[laughing]

01:48.750 --> 01:50.750
Take the apple.

01:50.750 --> 01:52.959
Better. Better... ish.

01:52.959 --> 01:55.250
Just hold still.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.709
Duh.

01:56.709 --> 01:58.709
You can't ask a villain
to stay put.

01:58.709 --> 02:00.125
Ya gotta-- Oh!

02:00.125 --> 02:01.542
Got it.
[chuckles]

02:01.542 --> 02:03.458
Nice.
[laughs]

02:06.458 --> 02:09.542
But on the night
of our first patrol,
he didn't show up.

02:12.750 --> 02:15.083
<i>I tracked his phone,</i>
<i>but I was too late. </i>
[beeping]

02:22.166 --> 02:24.291
Kev, are you here?

02:25.333 --> 02:26.792
Kevin!

02:26.792 --> 02:27.959
[gasps]

02:27.959 --> 02:30.083
<i>I didn't even notice her.</i>

02:31.208 --> 02:32.542
Huh?
[yells]

02:33.583 --> 02:35.709
Why? Why him?

02:35.709 --> 02:38.083
Who are you?

02:42.333 --> 02:44.291
[cries out]

02:45.959 --> 02:48.333
[groaning]

02:48.333 --> 02:51.417
<i>I can't explain it,</i>
<i>but when that woman cut me--</i>

02:51.417 --> 02:53.208
<i>barely cut me--</i>

02:53.208 --> 02:57.208
<i>it's like she sucked</i>
<i>the life right out of me.</i>

02:57.208 --> 02:59.875
I only just escaped,
and because she didn't
leave any marks,

02:59.875 --> 03:02.208
it looked the like the two of us
had been alone.

03:02.208 --> 03:05.083
The cops blamed me
for his death.

03:05.083 --> 03:07.667
I mean,
it could be true.

03:07.667 --> 03:10.375
I have heard of Inhumans
with weirder powers.

03:10.375 --> 03:13.917
Or she's just making it up,
and Kevin wasn't her bestie,

03:13.917 --> 03:17.125
he was just an enemy
or some kid in the way.

03:17.125 --> 03:19.667
How do you prove
someone was your best friend?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.458
[chuckles]
Huh?

03:21.458 --> 03:24.250
Never thought that this
would be anything
but an embarrassment,

03:24.250 --> 03:26.333
but for what it's worth...

03:26.333 --> 03:28.041
Well...

03:28.041 --> 03:30.041
Yeah, that's pretty convincing.
I'm in.

03:30.041 --> 03:33.417
Yeah. We'll help you find
the woman in the warehouse.

03:33.417 --> 03:36.083
No, you can't.
You're both still heroes,

03:36.083 --> 03:39.041
and if anyone thinks
that you're with me,
you'll be hunted too.

03:39.041 --> 03:41.959
Do you really want
the cops after you?
S.H.I.E.L.D.?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.500
It's the right thing to do.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.166
There are lots
of right things to do.

03:47.166 --> 03:51.041
I have to find this woman,
avenge my friend,
and clear my name.

03:51.041 --> 03:54.542
Until then, I can't help
the people of this city
the way that I should.

03:54.542 --> 03:56.333
But you can.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.166
[squirrel screeches]
[both gasp]

04:00.166 --> 04:01.583
[squirrels chittering]

04:05.041 --> 04:07.208
You better get outta here.
Tippy's friends say
someone's coming.

04:07.208 --> 04:09.208
Thank you. And, hey,

04:09.208 --> 04:12.208
it's okay if you leave
a couple muggers for me.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.750
[web shooter deploying]

04:14.750 --> 04:16.917
With the two of us together?
[chuckles]

04:16.917 --> 04:18.417
Not a chance.
[laughing]
