"Find saban khasanovic

00:06.600 --> 00:08.200
or I will pipe
another tune."

00:08.280 --> 00:09.520
That's like
the pied Piper.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.920
Marco khasanovic
was killed

00:11.000 --> 00:13.760
in a sniper attack
in August 1994.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.680
Whoever wants us to find
saban, it's not his father.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.960
Well, we haven't found his
mother amongst the dead yet.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.080
Man: I love you.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.800
Karl: If you want
to Rob someone,

00:23.880 --> 00:26.200
you just blow a bit of
scopolamine around in the air,

00:26.280 --> 00:28.561
and the tourists run to the atm
and hand over their money.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.120
It's an urban myth.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.360
I don't know.

03:52.440 --> 03:56.200
Listen, I need you to come
and pick me up right away.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.360
You can, and you will.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.200
Cold.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.520
Morning.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.000
I got up at 3:30
to use the bathroom

04:44.080 --> 04:45.360
and you still weren't home.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.560
What time did you get in?

04:46.640 --> 04:48.600
Just after 4:00, I think.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.840
You want me to make breakfast
so you can get a lie-in?

04:50.920 --> 04:52.240
No, no, I've done it.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.720
I don't know how
you function.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.200
It's incredible.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.280
I know.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.600
Me and Maggie Thatcher, eh?

04:58.680 --> 05:00.400
Two peas in a pod.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.960
Karl: Maya!

05:06.040 --> 05:07.400
Breakfast.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.800
Maya?

05:11.880 --> 05:13.480
Hello. Maya's dad.

05:13.560 --> 05:15.280
Dad, this is
my friend Kayla.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.760
Hello, Kayla.
It's, um, breakfast time.

05:17.801 --> 05:20.121
Are you two not gonna see each
other in about half an hour?

05:20.145 --> 05:20.480
Dad.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.320
Hey, Mr. R.,
me and Maya were

05:22.400 --> 05:24.080
thinking about going
to the cinema tonight.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.560
You're cool with that,
right?

05:25.640 --> 05:27.160
She'll be home by 9:00.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.600
Um, yeah. Ok. Yeah.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.040
Breakfast.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.200
Oh.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.200
Good morning. Can I see
your hanger, please?

06:29.840 --> 06:31.120
Thank you very much.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.040
Lovely.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.680
Winnie:
So what have we got?

07:37.760 --> 07:39.880
Karl: We've got people
trawling through birth records,

07:39.904 --> 07:42.800
looking for any khasanovic
link to saban and Marco.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.800
The mother seems like
the best bet,

07:44.880 --> 07:47.680
but if she's illegal,
she's gonna be hard to find.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.560
Elise: We're looking at
how the rat monger man

07:50.640 --> 07:52.320
or the guy who nearly
killed us with a boat

07:52.344 --> 07:53.520
can be connected
to her.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.000
Winnie: Well, bet you
a bag of bonbons

07:57.080 --> 07:58.720
they're in it together.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.080
Aah!

08:00.160 --> 08:01.640
Get it out.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.160
Jesus! Winnie: Get out!

08:16.000 --> 08:17.600
It's saban khasanovic.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.560
It's the photo that was
used for the calais-gram.

08:19.584 --> 08:20.840
Bb: What's going on?

08:20.920 --> 08:22.360
Winnie: Right.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.440
I want a team here
to deal with it right now.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.960
I want to know how the fuck
it got through security.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.321
Whoever we're dealing with
is a certified fucking lunatic.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.240
Karl:
What does it say?

08:31.320 --> 08:33.640
"This will escalate.
No trifling."

08:33.720 --> 08:35.400
And there's coordinates.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.559
Why would she help us?

08:42.840 --> 08:44.280
Man: Where do I go
to report a crime?

08:44.320 --> 08:45.760
You can't park
there, sir?

08:45.840 --> 08:47.080
I didn't ask
where I could park.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.600
I asked where I could
report a crime.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.840
Just through
those doors.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.240
Ask for the concierge.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.080
Is this staying?

09:03.120 --> 09:04.800
What?
This.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.040
Yes. Stop.

09:10.360 --> 09:13.080
It's an anti-theft device.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.360
Generates compassion.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.800
Well, if you find
a new partner,

09:16.880 --> 09:18.600
she won't be aroused
by this.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.800
Not everyone's
relationships

09:22.880 --> 09:24.680
are quite as binary
as yours, Elise.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.160
You know, it's actually
quite complicated.

09:27.240 --> 09:30.880
Just, you know, taking
a bit of space.

09:30.960 --> 09:32.400
This is it.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.720
This should be
the exact spot.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.760
Well, there's
nothing here.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.760
Maybe they weren't
coordinates.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.560
Karl.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.880
Karl: What is
this place?

10:44.120 --> 10:46.720
Elise: What is it?

10:46.800 --> 10:49.600
Karl: King of something,
judging by the crown.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.040
Recognize him?

10:51.120 --> 10:52.560
No.

10:54.640 --> 10:59.760
What's that?
Sword, longbow. Soldier?

11:04.800 --> 11:07.080
Elise: What is that
supposed to be, a bishop?

11:07.160 --> 11:09.560
Karl: It's a pope.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.880
And look, skeletons.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.560
I think I know
what this is.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.560
It's danse macabre.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.760
Danse macabre?

11:19.840 --> 11:21.400
It's a medieval thing.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.200
They represent
all walks of life.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.160
The king's authority.
The pope's religion.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.480
A child.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.600
Saban.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.440
They're dancing
to their graves.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.040
It's a reminder of
the fragility of life

11:42.120 --> 11:44.600
and the inevitability
of a gruesome death.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.440
Some versions of
the pied Piper see him

11:46.520 --> 11:48.440
as a figure of death.

11:52.120 --> 11:55.160
The laborer.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.240
I know him.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.840
Who is that?

11:59.920 --> 12:02.240
It's the guy you were
rude to in the car park.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.800
This one is missing
a mug shot.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.040
"Gary green.
Dance to my tune."

12:21.120 --> 12:23.200
Rats.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.920
Karl: Shit.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.240
He wasn't killed here.

13:29.480 --> 13:32.080
"The deadliest poison
is one without sickness."

13:34.200 --> 13:36.120
"Find saban."

13:38.360 --> 13:40.880
Jesus Christ.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.360
So where's
the rest of him?

13:55.720 --> 13:57.000
Karl: "It had been
a long day,

13:57.080 --> 13:58.960
"so I had a few pints

13:59.040 --> 14:01.280
at the horse and groom
pub on the high street."

14:01.360 --> 14:04.160
But you didn't,
did you, Wesley?

14:04.240 --> 14:05.760
Look, like I said,
my drink was spiked,

14:05.800 --> 14:07.400
so I don't
remember anything.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.680
You know, the problem with
living in a surveillance state

14:09.704 --> 14:12.184
is it's a real bugger
to try and tell a good lie.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.880
Do you mind leaving us
alone for a moment?

14:37.120 --> 14:39.840
I need you to find out
who did this to me.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.040
In 1284, the German
town of hamelin

14:42.120 --> 14:44.400
suffered a massive
rat infestation.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.000
I'm sorry, what?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.880
Does the name khasanovic
mean anything to you?

14:47.960 --> 14:50.040
Do you have any idea
how many illegal immigrants

14:50.120 --> 14:51.760
walk through that door?

14:56.240 --> 14:59.040
Who are these men?

14:59.120 --> 15:01.120
Never seen any of them
before in my life.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.680
Your photo was found
in a rogues' gallery

15:03.760 --> 15:05.640
within spitting distance

15:05.720 --> 15:07.600
of where a man
was hacked to pieces.

15:07.680 --> 15:08.960
I've told you all
that I can.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.640
I don't know if
it's a good thing

15:31.720 --> 15:35.240
or a bad thing
we met each other.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.360
Winnie: Wesley pollinger.

15:44.440 --> 15:45.840
Why is he the laborer?

15:45.920 --> 15:47.560
Sarcasm, I'm guessing.

15:47.640 --> 15:50.080
Let's get him tested
for scopolamine.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.280
Bb: There are 562
Gary Greens in britain.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.120
Great.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.600
Yeah, I'm working on it.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.880
That's an address
for our victim.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.400
Lawrence Taylor,
the doughnut nut.

16:01.480 --> 16:04.880
He was a viral sensation
for a day or two

16:04.960 --> 16:06.640
before being vilified
as a troll.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.520
Oh, stand by your beds.
Here comes trouble.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.080
Bonjour, tout le monde.

16:11.160 --> 16:12.920
Karl: For fuck's sake.
Let's get out of here.

16:12.944 --> 16:14.720
Astor. Heh.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.200
I heard about
the rat.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.720
I didn't tell him.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.680
Oh, they heard
the scream in calais.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.200
As they say in the movies,
shit just got real.

16:31.680 --> 16:33.320
Half this stuff
he never even used.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.120
Total waste of money, just
like I said it would be.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.120
Golf clubs.
Give me fucking strength.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.320
This trolling you're
talking about

16:41.400 --> 16:43.120
is not the man I knew.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.720
He would never abuse
someone like that.

16:44.744 --> 16:45.680
Elise: Mrs. Taylor...

16:45.760 --> 16:47.320
Leave it. Leave it.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.040
Shall we just
have a cup of tea?

16:58.480 --> 16:59.960
Hello.

17:03.280 --> 17:04.960
I'm gonna
need your phone.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.280
My kids are the same.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.760
The millennial's panacea.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.920
It'll help your
social development.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.240
Wait.

17:21.319 --> 17:22.359
Karl.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.736
Elise: Millennials are
those who reached adulthood

17:43.760 --> 17:45.160
at the turn of
the century.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.440
That kid
was post-millennial,

17:46.520 --> 17:48.000
generation "z."

17:49.800 --> 17:51.440
Karl: How would I cope
without you?

17:53.400 --> 17:54.880
Um, ahem.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.760
Supervisor:
Thanks for coming.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.400
So I double checked,

17:58.480 --> 18:00.080
and they definitely
didn't take anything.

18:00.104 --> 18:02.880
You're here about
the break-in, yeah?

18:02.960 --> 18:04.200
You're Gary green.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.760
What break-in?

18:05.840 --> 18:08.760
Sorry. Some fucker
chopped through the chain

18:08.840 --> 18:10.480
on the front gate.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.360
Does the name khasanovic
mean anything to you?

18:12.384 --> 18:17.840
Um, there was
a Lana khasanovic

18:17.920 --> 18:20.880
here for a few months
last year.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.440
Karl: How old is she?

18:23.520 --> 18:27.120
Um, late thirties,
early forties.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.520
What did she look like?

18:28.600 --> 18:29.600
Height, build.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.840
Hair color, eye color.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.920
Dark hair, dark eyes,
I think.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.640
I'm sorry. It was
a long time ago.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.440
We need contact details.
Address, number,

18:37.520 --> 18:39.440
the name of the agency
that supplied her.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.440
Well, some of the workers,
they're, um,

18:41.520 --> 18:43.080
they're cash in hand.
It's just the way.

18:43.104 --> 18:43.760
Yeah.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.560
But I'll go
and check in my office.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.240
What were you doing
last night, Gary?

18:47.320 --> 18:49.040
I was at home. Why?

18:51.600 --> 18:53.880
We found this near a man
who had been butchered alive.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.080
Any ideas?
You sure you were at home?

18:56.160 --> 18:58.800
I swear.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.600
You should have a look
at this, though.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.080
Uh.

19:05.800 --> 19:09.680
This arrived a couple
of days ago.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.640
Can we see
your backside?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.400
What the fuck are you
talking about?

19:15.480 --> 19:16.640
If you didn't go through
that,

19:16.680 --> 19:18.000
you won't have
any branding marks.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.600
You need to stop
production immediately.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.440
The deadliest poison
is one without sickness.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.520
Karl: We think they're
trying to tighten the screws

19:33.560 --> 19:36.000
on us finding saban by putting
human meat into the food chain.

19:36.024 --> 19:37.560
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.800
Fuck!

19:40.880 --> 19:43.760
Right.
Call the lab.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.480
Get the pies tested
for human DNA.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.080
This takes priority
over everything.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.040
I need Gary green's
factory shut down.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.360
I need to be sure there are
no links to the media.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.600
And I need a full list
of his customers.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.360
Does he supply
to France?

19:58.440 --> 19:59.440
Yes.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.160
Shit.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.200
Hey.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.560
It's not harmful.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.280
Cannibalism is
an irrational taboo.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.560
Are you actually insane?

20:21.640 --> 20:22.960
Can you spare some
of your team?

20:23.040 --> 20:24.920
Bb: Yes, brilliant.
Thank you.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.840
You were right about
Wesley pollinger.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.920
The scopolamine tests
came back positive.

20:28.959 --> 20:31.240
Karl: Is this the stuff from
Lawrence Taylor's hard drive?

20:31.264 --> 20:33.520
Yeah. We're talking hundreds
of trolling victims.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.160
Lana khasanovic?

20:35.240 --> 20:36.720
No, there's no trace
of her anywhere.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.320
It doesn't mean
she's not there.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.976
But if she is, she's
concealed her identity.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.440
Karl: Someone
Lawrence Taylor trolled

20:41.464 --> 20:42.640
hated him enough
to kill him.

20:42.720 --> 20:43.840
It's not
Lana khasanovic.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.480
It's the rat man.

20:45.560 --> 20:46.760
Keep looking.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.960
Bb: Hang on.
In better news,

20:49.040 --> 20:51.360
we think we found
the pope.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.800
Good.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.840
Oh, Christ.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.800
Madame. Monsieur.

25:06.440 --> 25:07.720
This is where you went,
isn't it?

25:07.744 --> 25:09.880
I don't remember
where I went.

25:09.960 --> 25:11.800
It certainly
wasn't there.

25:11.880 --> 25:14.440
We just need
your help.

25:14.520 --> 25:17.000
Our other lead
just hanged himself.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.440
Karl: Tell us what
you do remember.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.360
Whoever did this is
capable of much worse.

25:29.040 --> 25:32.520
I have a vague
recollection

25:32.600 --> 25:34.280
of leaving the office,

25:34.360 --> 25:37.040
and then I woke up
on the beach.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.480
Whatever happened
to me,

25:38.560 --> 25:40.760
it literally wiped
my memory.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.360
Do you have any idea

25:42.440 --> 25:43.800
how fucking terrifying
that is?

25:43.880 --> 25:46.640
Yeah.

25:46.720 --> 25:48.760
Pollinger: Please.
I'm telling the truth.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.560
I swear.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.520
I might be gone for
a couple of nights.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.920
Why are you being
so cagey?

26:09.000 --> 26:10.920
Come on.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.280
You know nothing gets
past my twin-tuition.

26:20.480 --> 26:22.320
Has Blake told you
where he was last night?

26:22.400 --> 26:26.320
Oh, he was out
with his mates.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.720
Why are you asking me?

26:28.800 --> 26:31.400
Can't trust him, kiki.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.080
What's going on?

26:45.160 --> 26:46.680
I'm going out.

26:46.760 --> 26:49.000
Bye, sis. Love you.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.880
Kiki: Love you, too.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.600
You don't think
he's acting weird?

27:05.640 --> 27:07.920
Hey.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.960
Hey. It's ok.

27:11.040 --> 27:13.360
It's not what he said.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.560
Something's happened
to him,

27:15.640 --> 27:17.560
and I don't know what.

27:21.320 --> 27:23.960
Woman on TV: The old pairs of
shoes they found in... shop

27:24.040 --> 27:25.256
and you could only have
one, what would you pick?

27:25.280 --> 27:26.680
Louboutins,
definitely.

27:26.760 --> 27:27.760
Yeah, I like...

27:30.360 --> 27:32.560
I thought you were
going to the movies.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.440
She went with Leo instead.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.080
It's fine.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.720
You're hating this,
aren't you?

27:43.800 --> 27:45.840
No, no, it's...

27:48.120 --> 27:49.200
Yeah.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.560
Let's
watch a film instead.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.080
Your choice.

27:55.160 --> 27:57.680
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.400
Celeste?

27:59.480 --> 28:02.560
This is gonna be long,
slow, and subtitled.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.640
You better get me
a top up.

28:04.720 --> 28:07.480
There's always
a consolation.

28:08.880 --> 28:13.160
Hmm. Whoa.
This fridge is spotless.

28:13.240 --> 28:15.640
Did you see Joanna today?
Is she on speed?

28:15.720 --> 28:18.160
Celeste: I fired her.You did what?

28:18.240 --> 28:20.680
It's a waste of money
when I can do a better job.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.480
And I don't trust them.

28:22.560 --> 28:23.760
Who's "them"?

28:23.840 --> 28:25.080
They're all on
the take, Karl.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.680
It's Elise.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.440
Ciao.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.520
Bonjour. Bonsoir.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.560
What, now?

28:51.200 --> 28:52.680
What's up?

28:55.640 --> 28:59.400
Scopolamine's easy to find.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.120
Wesley's our only lead.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.600
And I've read
everything I can find.

29:02.680 --> 29:04.080
There's no consensus.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.736
Some people say
it creates complete amnesia.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.440
Some say partial.
I think he's lying to us.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.920
So this is the only
way to find out.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.520
No.

29:10.600 --> 29:12.080
You do that,
you're on your own.

29:12.160 --> 29:15.360
Well, it's too late.
I've already taken some.

29:15.440 --> 29:16.680
I knew you'd try
and stop me.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.016
I took some the minute
you buzzed up.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.440
You dragged me away
from my daughter

29:19.520 --> 29:21.040
so you can experiment
with scopolamine.

29:21.064 --> 29:23.520
You're the only person
I trust.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.320
No.

29:33.400 --> 29:35.800
Fuck you.

29:44.440 --> 29:48.080
That should do it.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.720
Oh, I'm not scared
of spiders.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.640
Yeah, that doesn't
matter, does it?

29:52.720 --> 29:55.840
Just matters whether you
remember it in the morning. No?

29:58.040 --> 30:01.760
Ok. Uh.

30:01.840 --> 30:08.120
Can you please sing
"happy birthday"?

30:08.200 --> 30:10.760
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.240
Happy birthday, dear Karl.

30:13.320 --> 30:15.280
Happy birthday to you.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.200
It's not today, is it?

30:21.280 --> 30:23.960
No. I just thought
I'd take advantage of it

30:24.040 --> 30:26.440
while I could.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.560
Don't think that's
gonna happen again.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.720
Why are you doing so
much on this Moreau case

30:33.800 --> 30:35.720
when you're not
supposed to go near it?

30:46.320 --> 30:49.280
Elise? Hello?

30:49.360 --> 30:51.600
I'm not like everyone
else. I know that.

30:55.080 --> 30:58.000
I know that.
I fuck up relationships.

30:58.080 --> 31:01.120
I hurt people.
But I don't fuck up at work.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.520
No.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.800
There's a flaw
in that case,

31:03.880 --> 31:05.680
and I have to find it.

31:05.760 --> 31:07.000
Elise, you've got
to understand.

31:07.040 --> 31:12.160
The work we have, Karl,

31:12.240 --> 31:14.560
it's all I've got.

31:19.320 --> 31:22.160
If I can't fix it...

31:26.640 --> 31:29.000
What's left for me?
Nothing.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.800
Everybody makes
mistakes, Elise.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.240
He's living in squalor,
Jacques Moreau.

31:52.320 --> 31:55.360
He's got shit
all over his wall.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.680
So I asked him to come
stay with me,

31:59.760 --> 32:01.440
and he said no.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.600
Of course he said no because
what am I doing for him?

32:03.640 --> 32:05.400
Elise, you don't
have to atone...

32:05.480 --> 32:08.720
No, I can rationalize
every failure.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.640
Not what I did
to that family.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.520
All I'm saying is it's
not your responsibility

32:13.544 --> 32:14.600
to take care of him.

32:14.680 --> 32:15.720
Why shouldn't I?

32:15.800 --> 32:18.520
You look after me
all the time.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.320
Pfft.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.120
I'm gonna get you
some water.

33:25.800 --> 33:28.080
It's all right.
You all right?

33:28.160 --> 33:31.240
Elise?

33:31.320 --> 33:33.720
Do you think this is all?

33:38.640 --> 33:40.440
Infinity can't be...

33:42.720 --> 33:44.560
Destroyed, only transferred.

33:44.640 --> 33:47.320
Then where does it go?

33:51.960 --> 33:53.560
'Cause Lawrence Taylor,
he was alive,

33:53.640 --> 33:55.160
and then he was dead.

33:57.680 --> 34:01.040
Here. Have some water.

34:01.120 --> 34:02.680
I didn't know that
affected you so much.

34:02.704 --> 34:04.760
You should have said.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.640
You know me better
than that.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.360
Drink.

34:10.800 --> 34:13.880
Do you want
the music on?

34:13.960 --> 34:15.880
Do you want
the lights on?

34:15.960 --> 34:18.040
You cold?

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
Ohh.

34:51.239 --> 34:52.320
Eat.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.960
Why?

34:56.239 --> 34:57.920
'Cause it'll make you
feel better.

35:00.120 --> 35:01.640
Right, let's get
this over with,

35:01.720 --> 35:05.800
and then you can tell me the
French for "I told you so."

35:05.880 --> 35:07.440
How did you feel

35:07.520 --> 35:09.640
when we discovered
Lawrence Taylor's body?

35:09.720 --> 35:12.040
I don't know.
It's part of the job.

35:12.120 --> 35:14.560
Mm-hmm.

35:14.640 --> 35:16.400
Do you remember talking
about him last night?

35:16.424 --> 35:18.264
No.

35:23.320 --> 35:25.840
Did I shout at you?

35:28.640 --> 35:31.400
I did.

35:31.480 --> 35:34.200
What about the song? Do
you remember singing a song?

35:34.280 --> 35:36.400
Um...

35:37.840 --> 35:40.280
Uh, yeah, I sang a song.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.680
Don't remember
what song.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.120
What about the video?

35:50.400 --> 35:52.000
Spiders.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.240
Spider. A spider.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.360
And then it's
all distorted,

35:59.440 --> 36:00.760
like in a dream.

36:00.840 --> 36:02.400
I do remember bits,

36:02.480 --> 36:04.680
before and after
I took it.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.960
So it's not
a retro amnesia.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.040
Pardon?

36:11.120 --> 36:13.360
That's French for
"I told you so."

36:13.440 --> 36:15.000
Heh!

36:27.000 --> 36:29.120
And you think
one of these 5 men

36:29.200 --> 36:30.960
might be the other half
of the pied Piper?

36:31.040 --> 36:33.240
They're all
within our zone.

36:33.296 --> 36:35.696
They've all got good reason to
want to kill the doughnut nut.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.640
Reading some of
his trolling,

36:37.720 --> 36:39.320
I might have
done it meself.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.600
Better be nice
to you, then.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.600
And don't you
forget it.

36:46.040 --> 36:48.080
All right.
Shall we do this?

36:48.160 --> 36:50.000
Yeah.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.600
Sorry if I said things
I shouldn't have.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.560
How much further
down here?

37:10.440 --> 37:11.440
I don't know.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.520
Come on.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.520
A mile or so.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.360
I know I was a dick
to you yesterday.

37:24.440 --> 37:25.720
Huh.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.360
I was just scared.

37:29.240 --> 37:31.360
I thought maybe if I could
get a crime number...

37:31.440 --> 37:33.200
What's this,
confession?

37:48.920 --> 37:53.800
Soon as I logged on,
a chat window opened up.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.440
And she knew stuff
about me.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.360
Karl: Mm-hmm.

37:57.440 --> 37:59.520
Intimate stuff.

37:59.600 --> 38:00.800
And then you got here?

38:00.880 --> 38:03.440
Yes. There was fire...

38:03.520 --> 38:05.200
And music.

38:06.680 --> 38:09.160
I don't remember
any more.

38:09.240 --> 38:11.400
Why did she
choose me?

38:11.480 --> 38:13.720
Karl: We think you may have
refused her legal advice

38:13.800 --> 38:15.320
at some point.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.720
What did she
look like?

38:17.800 --> 38:20.200
Elise: Karl.

38:23.880 --> 38:26.400
Oh, Jesus Christ.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.360
Karl: What happened
here, Wesley?

38:28.440 --> 38:30.280
We need a description.

38:34.240 --> 38:36.320
She was white.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.080
Average height.

38:39.160 --> 38:42.400
Dark hair, I think.

38:44.480 --> 38:47.200
She was wearing
a gas mask.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.120
Can you tell us everything
that happened here

38:51.200 --> 38:52.960
from the beginning?

39:04.000 --> 39:08.880
There was
some kind of dust

39:08.960 --> 39:13.720
that came down
from the ceiling.

39:13.800 --> 39:17.720
Then she told us to
take our clothes off.

39:17.800 --> 39:20.240
And for some reason,
we did.

39:26.520 --> 39:29.120
Ohh.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.320
And she made us watch.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.400
Oh, Jesus.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.880
Did she cut him up?

39:36.960 --> 39:40.960
Did Lana khasanovic
butcher a man alive?

39:41.040 --> 39:44.240
She didn't do
the cutting herself.

39:44.320 --> 39:45.600
A man did it.

39:50.240 --> 39:53.880
Man: ♪ what ever happened
to the heroes ♪

39:55.000 --> 39:56.360
Louise: Thank god
for that.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.120
Bb: You don't like
my taste in music?

39:58.200 --> 39:59.920
Well, that's a shame.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.520
You might have several
more hours of it yet.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.720
Are there any songs

40:04.800 --> 40:07.240
that you don't know
the words to?

40:07.320 --> 40:09.160
Tell you what,

40:09.240 --> 40:10.480
I'll buy a copy of
"Joe le taxi"

40:10.504 --> 40:12.040
at the next
service station.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.760
Or the best
of Edith piaf, maybe.

40:14.840 --> 40:17.960
Oh, you're really up to date
with your French music, huh?

40:18.040 --> 40:20.440
So which one is this?

40:20.520 --> 40:22.160
The doughnut nut
tricked him

40:22.200 --> 40:24.080
into thinking his long
lost mum was still alive.

40:24.104 --> 40:25.480
Stand him up
like a kipper.

40:26.840 --> 40:29.240
Kipper?

40:32.120 --> 40:33.480
You Anton Stokes?

40:33.560 --> 40:34.800
No. He's not here.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.320
What's your name?

40:36.400 --> 40:37.760
What?

40:37.840 --> 40:40.240
Your name.

40:40.320 --> 40:41.800
And could you tell
me where you were

40:41.880 --> 40:43.160
last night?

40:45.960 --> 40:49.240
They must really hate you
if they made you the king.

40:49.320 --> 40:52.080
I bet you've got a big red
branded on your ass and all.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.920
Nothing out
the back.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.560
Where's Wesley?

40:56.640 --> 40:59.000
He went outside
to vomit.

40:59.080 --> 41:01.640
Don't look too good
yourself.

41:01.720 --> 41:05.120
So she drugs the punters
with scopolamine,

41:05.200 --> 41:06.440
then, whoosh, drops
the curtain

41:06.520 --> 41:07.720
to reveal sweeney Todd.

41:09.720 --> 41:11.280
I'm guess that's used
to hold them still

41:11.304 --> 41:13.384
while she brands
their asses.

41:15.520 --> 41:16.800
What's that?

41:16.880 --> 41:19.160
Don't know. But there's
another one here.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.360
Some sort of
restraining thing?

41:21.440 --> 41:23.320
Did they restrain
Lawrence Taylor with it?

41:23.400 --> 41:24.920
Yeah, but what is it
usually for?

41:25.000 --> 41:26.760
Good question.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.840
Do you know someone
called Lana khasanovic?

41:32.920 --> 41:34.280
Know where she lives?

41:34.360 --> 41:35.800
No.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.800
This was at the flesh show.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.240
Do you know what it is?

41:45.320 --> 41:47.000
No.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.840
Bb: That looks like
a caravan tether.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.840
Yeah, my uncle's
got one.

41:51.920 --> 41:53.480
Specific to caravans?

41:53.520 --> 41:55.640
Yeah. You use it to anchor
your caravan to the ground.

41:55.664 --> 41:57.424
It stops it
blowing over.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.760
Karl: Bb.

42:04.840 --> 42:07.120
Right. Um...

42:07.200 --> 42:11.080
So there's
4, 5 sites.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.880
But between
the cattle barn

42:12.960 --> 42:15.080
and the caves,
there's only two.

42:15.160 --> 42:17.480
Right. We'll take
the one below the railway.

42:17.560 --> 42:18.920
You take the other one.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.120
Ok.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.000
Good afternoon.

42:44.080 --> 42:46.760
You got a license
for that lot? Soldier.

42:46.840 --> 42:49.640
Man: Shall I fish
the paperwork for you?

42:49.720 --> 42:52.240
We're looking for someone
called Lana khasanovic.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.640
I think you might know her.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.520
Of course.

42:57.920 --> 43:00.240
Follow me.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.920
It's that one there.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.720
All right.
You wait there.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.520
We'll take it
from here.

43:07.120 --> 43:08.480
Boss, get yourself
down here quick.

43:08.560 --> 43:09.920
We found her.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.520
I'll go to the back.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.440
Bb!

44:31.120 --> 44:33.920
You go around, see
if you can cut her off.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.280
Did you find him?

45:17.360 --> 45:19.000
Did you find
my boy?

45:21.000 --> 45:22.280
Put the gun down.

45:22.360 --> 45:23.840
You didn't, did you?

45:23.920 --> 45:26.240
Just put the gun down.
And we...

45:35.000 --> 45:37.600
Bugger.

45:42.840 --> 45:45.040
Please, please.
