00:02.236 --> 00:03.571
- Are you ready, kids?

00:03.637 --> 00:05.206
kids:
Aye, aye, Captain!

00:05.273 --> 00:06.740
- I can't hear you.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.842
kids:
Aye, aye, Captain!

00:08.909 --> 00:11.812
- * Ohh... *

00:11.879 --> 00:13.814
* Who lives in a pineapple
under the sea? *

00:13.881 --> 00:15.883
kids:
SpongeBob SquarePants!

00:15.949 --> 00:17.751
- * Absorbent and yellow
and porous is he *

00:17.818 --> 00:19.687
kids:
SpongeBob SquarePants!

00:19.753 --> 00:21.855
- * If nautical nonsense
be something you wish *

00:21.922 --> 00:23.957
kids:
SpongeBob SquarePants!

00:24.024 --> 00:25.859
- * Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish *

00:25.926 --> 00:27.828
kids: SpongeBob SquarePants!
- Ready?

00:27.895 --> 00:29.663
all:
SpongeBob SquarePants!

00:29.730 --> 00:31.999
SpongeBob SquarePants!

00:32.066 --> 00:33.867
SpongeBob SquarePants!

00:33.934 --> 00:35.236
- SpongeBob

00:35.303 --> 00:37.105
SquarePants!

00:37.171 --> 00:39.840
[laughing]

00:39.907 --> 00:42.110
* *

00:42.176 --> 00:43.711
[waves crashing]

00:49.717 --> 00:54.255
* *

00:54.322 --> 00:57.325
- You are traveling through
an aquatic dimension.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.194
A dimension not only
of laughs and giggles,

01:00.261 --> 01:04.265
but of uncontrollable
nose milk.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.467
When things start
to get coocoo,

01:06.534 --> 01:08.702
there's a pretty good
chance you may have

01:08.769 --> 01:13.941
just entered "The Tidal Zone!"

01:14.007 --> 01:15.876
- And we're back!

01:15.943 --> 01:17.111
[together]
Yay!

01:17.178 --> 01:19.280
- Our next guest
on "The Patrick Show"

01:19.347 --> 01:25.486
are the wonderfully
talented Captain Quaaa...

01:25.553 --> 01:28.389
Quaaa...

01:28.456 --> 01:30.390
[growling]

01:30.458 --> 01:32.993
Ahh!

01:33.060 --> 01:36.930
- Captain Quasar and Pat-Tron!

01:36.997 --> 01:39.098
[cheers and applause]

01:39.167 --> 01:40.934
[spaceship beeping]

01:41.001 --> 01:44.205
all: Ahh!

01:47.175 --> 01:49.610
- Welcome to the show, fellas.

01:49.676 --> 01:52.446
Cool spaceship.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.548
Where are you guys from?

01:54.615 --> 01:57.884
- Um, outer space.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.588
- Out her face?

02:00.654 --> 02:03.191
- No.
Just outer space.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.759
- Well, better out than in!

02:05.826 --> 02:08.728
[laughter]

02:08.795 --> 02:10.431
- [zapping]

02:10.497 --> 02:12.366
- Oh! Ooh!

02:12.433 --> 02:15.669
- Pat-Tron, I told you to
turn off your laugh track.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.672
It always strips his gears.

02:18.739 --> 02:19.873
- Don't worry, folks.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.177
I can fix it.

02:23.244 --> 02:26.347
- Ha-ha-ha-ha,
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

02:26.414 --> 02:29.583
- [grunting]

02:29.650 --> 02:30.884
I can't fix it!

02:30.951 --> 02:32.286
Let me out!

02:32.353 --> 02:36.290
- Evacuating robo-bowels.

02:36.357 --> 02:39.760
- Ooh, I got something
stuck to my melon.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.262
- That's my shrink ray.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.897
I thought I lost that.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.499
- Ooh!

02:45.566 --> 02:48.769
- Ahh!
It's making my head all spicy!

02:48.836 --> 02:50.037
Ahh!

02:50.103 --> 02:51.472
- Stop!
Give me back my shrink ray!

02:51.539 --> 02:53.106
- Ahh!

02:53.173 --> 02:56.009
- Hola, my little
chatty show hosts.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.411
- Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

02:57.478 --> 02:59.480
- Who wants to order a pizza?

02:59.547 --> 03:01.048
- Ahh-- Ooh.

03:01.114 --> 03:04.518
I'll take a large with
pineapple and potpourri.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.620
both: Ohhh!

03:06.687 --> 03:09.156
- Here you go.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.759
- [squeaking]

03:11.825 --> 03:13.227
[all gasping]

03:13.294 --> 03:16.063
- Um, fear not,
studio audience.

03:16.129 --> 03:22.670
I will unshrink them with the
growth ray I have in my ship.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.908
- Woo...hoo?

03:27.975 --> 03:29.142
- Wow.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.913
Our house is gigantic now!

03:32.980 --> 03:36.317
Oh, here's my gum!

03:36.384 --> 03:38.819
- And so cinematic.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.888
- It's cine-gigantic!

03:40.954 --> 03:42.890
Is that even a word?

03:42.956 --> 03:45.926
- Ha, don't be retupulous,
Bunny, of course not.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.596
Being small is gonna
be fun-gigantic!

03:48.662 --> 03:52.099
Last one to the big, stinky
sock is a rotten fish egg!

03:52.165 --> 03:53.401
- Hey, good one, Dad!

03:53.466 --> 03:57.471
- [laughs]
Shall we?

03:57.538 --> 04:00.841
both: * Small, small, small,
small, small, small, small *

04:00.908 --> 04:03.076
* *

04:03.143 --> 04:04.378
- Diminutive.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.547
- [laughs]
Yee-haw!

04:06.614 --> 04:08.716
Whoo-hoo!

04:08.782 --> 04:10.918
- Tiny.

04:10.984 --> 04:11.985
- Puny.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.987
- [laughs]
Whoa!

04:14.054 --> 04:15.188
- Itty-bitty.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.123
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

04:16.189 --> 04:17.791
- Teensy-weensy.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.427
- Small.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.394
- Ahh.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.095
Lovely.
- [barking]

04:22.162 --> 04:23.764
[together]
Ahh!

04:23.831 --> 04:27.067
Not now, Tinkle!

04:27.134 --> 04:30.538
[laughter]

04:30.604 --> 04:33.741
- I wish GrandPat
were here to enjoy this.

04:33.807 --> 04:36.043
- Hee-hee! Ahh!

04:36.109 --> 04:37.077
- Hello!
- Ahh!

04:37.144 --> 04:40.981
[electronic beeping]

04:41.048 --> 04:42.883
- [laughs]
Ooh!

04:42.950 --> 04:45.085
Ha-ha-ha!

04:45.152 --> 04:46.887
Oh!

04:46.954 --> 04:51.091
Can't an old man play violent
video games in peace anymore?

04:51.158 --> 04:52.125
Grr!

04:52.192 --> 04:54.127
Water?

04:54.194 --> 04:56.163
[grumbling]

04:56.229 --> 04:59.900
[laughter]

04:59.967 --> 05:01.935
- We got shrunk.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.103
- Hey, GrandPat!

05:03.170 --> 05:05.873
- Can you get us
some tiny towels?

05:05.939 --> 05:07.541
- Vermin?

05:07.608 --> 05:10.811
I'll get you with
my bug spray breath!

05:10.878 --> 05:12.045
[munching]

05:12.112 --> 05:14.782
[exhales]

05:14.848 --> 05:19.086
- GrandPat! No!

05:19.152 --> 05:22.656
- Hey!
Where'd they go?

05:22.723 --> 05:25.092
[all shouting]

05:25.158 --> 05:27.695
- You'll be safe in here,
Stars.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.297
- Whew.
That was a close shave.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.899
Thank you for saving us.

05:31.965 --> 05:32.966
- Yeah.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.135
We apologize for GrandPat.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.937
He thinks we're vermin.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.906
- Yeah.
Like you.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.374
- No worries.

05:40.441 --> 05:43.777
We were just sitting down
to eat our roasted peppermint.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.781
- It's not much, but we're
willing to share it with you.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.883
- Share what?

05:49.950 --> 05:51.919
- Patrick!
Manners!

05:51.985 --> 05:53.654
- Minty.
[doorbell ringing]

05:53.721 --> 05:54.722
- I'll get it!

05:54.788 --> 05:57.791
Ooh, I do hope
it's more guests.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.859
Boop.

05:58.926 --> 05:59.927
both: Ooh!

05:59.993 --> 06:00.961
Ahh!

06:01.028 --> 06:02.095
- I see you!

06:02.162 --> 06:03.664
- GrandPat?

06:03.731 --> 06:07.000
- To survive in the wild,
we find it best to stay

06:07.067 --> 06:08.869
out of family squabbles.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.203
Dartfishes, scatter!

06:10.270 --> 06:11.338
Ahh!

06:11.405 --> 06:13.874
- Ahh...
- Grr!

06:13.941 --> 06:16.844
- Ooh, take that!
- Ahh!

06:16.910 --> 06:20.380
- GrandPat scared
our new friends away.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.616
This time he's gone too far.

06:22.683 --> 06:26.053
- Then I guess his
beloved family is gonna

06:26.119 --> 06:27.421
have to teach him a lesson.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.823
- That's us, right?

06:29.890 --> 06:31.224
What?

06:31.291 --> 06:35.729
- Ooh, all this pest-huntin'
is making me hangry.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.197
Let's see here.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.532
[mumbling]

06:38.599 --> 06:41.669
both: Cake molds away!

06:41.735 --> 06:47.207
- Huh?

06:47.274 --> 06:48.709
Why you--

06:48.776 --> 06:51.812
Gah! Ahh! Achoo!

06:51.879 --> 06:53.246
Ahh!

06:53.313 --> 06:55.082
Why those little--

06:55.148 --> 06:57.017
Ahh!

06:57.084 --> 07:00.153
Grr. Ahh!

07:00.220 --> 07:02.623
Revenge of the vermin, eh?

07:02.690 --> 07:04.625
Ahh.

07:04.692 --> 07:07.260
Ohh!

07:07.327 --> 07:09.697
You! Ahh!

07:09.763 --> 07:11.298
Ohh! Ohh!

07:11.364 --> 07:13.467
Oh! Oh! Ahh! Ahh!

07:13.534 --> 07:16.870
- Whoa-ho-ho! Ahh! Ahh! Augh!

07:16.937 --> 07:22.142
Ohh, these insects
are smarter than my family.

07:22.209 --> 07:25.445
That's it!
No more Mr. Nice Geezer!

07:25.513 --> 07:27.414
Dentures, go get 'em!

07:27.481 --> 07:32.486
[together]
Ahh!

07:35.689 --> 07:36.890
- Hi.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.826
I am Rube-dor.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.328
I shrunk you down
with my futuristic

07:41.394 --> 07:44.231
shrink suckers
to save you from harm.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.866
- Thanks, Rube-dor.

07:45.933 --> 07:50.103
- And to introduce you to
the shimmering, shiny city

07:50.170 --> 07:51.872
of Shmandor.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.341
[together]
Ooh.

07:54.407 --> 07:57.010
- Shmandor is the place to be.

07:57.077 --> 08:01.081
Shmandor has fine dining,

08:01.148 --> 08:02.349
spacious homes,

08:02.415 --> 08:05.385
a state-of-the-art
transit system,

08:05.452 --> 08:07.655
shopping centers.

08:07.721 --> 08:11.759
And conveniently located
under the sea,

08:11.825 --> 08:17.364
Shmandor is entirely made
of hand-blown glass.

08:17.430 --> 08:20.400
[together]
Amazing.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.369
- Oh, boy, can we live here?

08:22.435 --> 08:24.337
- Sure, we can, kids.

08:24.404 --> 08:28.976
Shmandor is so beautiful,
it makes me feel like...

08:29.042 --> 08:30.711
* Singing *

08:30.778 --> 08:32.011
- Hold on!

08:32.078 --> 08:36.383
There's no singing
allowed in Shmandor!

08:36.448 --> 08:38.852
And that's why!

08:38.919 --> 08:40.287
- Yuck.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.123
Who wants to live in a
place where you can't sing?

08:43.190 --> 08:46.794
* That was a close one *

08:46.860 --> 08:50.063
- * And here comes
a closer one *

08:51.498 --> 08:54.234
[together]
Ahh!

08:54.301 --> 08:55.468
- We're too small
to be run over.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.505
- Whew.
- Ha-ha.

08:58.572 --> 09:02.710
- Now, where would I hide
if I was a filthy flea?

09:02.776 --> 09:08.749
- I think it's time to
resume GrandPat's lesson.

09:08.816 --> 09:12.519
- I picked this one
up inside Pat-tron.

09:12.586 --> 09:16.256
- Whoa! Guh! Ohh!

09:16.323 --> 09:19.860
My scooter is haunted!

09:19.927 --> 09:21.394
Ahh!

09:21.461 --> 09:23.363
[panting]

09:23.430 --> 09:26.033
Ha!

09:26.099 --> 09:28.101
Ahh!

09:28.168 --> 09:31.504
Ohh! Ahh!

09:36.710 --> 09:38.211
Aha!

09:38.278 --> 09:43.851
Quit spookin' my wheels
or I'll roast you ghosts!

09:43.917 --> 09:46.486
Ahh!

09:46.553 --> 09:49.456
Egypt?
I love Egypt!

09:49.522 --> 09:51.391
Ohh! Ahh!

09:51.458 --> 09:53.493
Ugh!

09:53.560 --> 09:56.163
But I hate mummies!

09:56.229 --> 09:57.998
I gotta get home!

09:58.065 --> 10:00.067
- [giggles] That was fun,
but what if we're

10:00.133 --> 10:03.203
too small for the
audience to see us?

10:03.270 --> 10:05.272
- Hey, guys, look what I found.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.841
Jumbo Grow plant food!

10:07.908 --> 10:14.447
- Be careful!
- It's time to grow up!

10:14.514 --> 10:17.450
- Now I can see
the fine print, Patrick.

10:17.517 --> 10:21.454
It grows plants,
but it shrinks people.

10:21.521 --> 10:24.324
You shrunk us down
to the sub-atomic

10:24.391 --> 10:26.559
teensy-weensy level.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.430
- Ohh, now I'll never
finish tonight's show.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.532
- Stay together, Stars.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.334
I think there's
a way out of here!

10:34.401 --> 10:36.536
[all shouting]

10:36.603 --> 10:38.706
- Look, we're home.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.174
Everything's back to normal.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.242
Right?

10:42.309 --> 10:43.576
[together]
Right!

10:43.643 --> 10:46.479
- Ahh! Except the Moon
is a big eyeball now.

10:46.546 --> 10:50.450
all: Ahh!

10:50.517 --> 10:52.753

[roars]

22:04.256 --> 22:05.758
[spooky music]

22:05.825 --> 22:08.395
- Robots can never
replace us, you say?

22:08.461 --> 22:11.931
Well, anything can
happen in a cartoon,

22:11.998 --> 22:15.802
especially if that cartoon
is from "The Tidal Zone."

22:15.868 --> 22:17.537

"The Tidal Zone."

22:17.604 --> 22:19.372

23:08.888 --> 23:10.189
Oh, is that my hat?

- [French accent]
Lightning berries

23:15.828 --> 23:18.130
and Karen's
computer circuitry.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.732
A potent combination

23:19.799 --> 23:22.802
which results in
a shocking mind switch.

23:22.869 --> 23:25.037
A common occurrence here in...

23:26.706 --> 23:27.940

and Harvey goes "yeah."

23:40.286 --> 23:43.155
And then Kevin said "yeah."
[laughs]

23:43.222 --> 23:44.757
Everybody was saying yeah.

23:44.824 --> 23:47.527
- Enough!
Why are you talking to me?

23:47.594 --> 23:50.463
- I'm making memories.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.732

And where are those lightning
berries I asked you for?

24:03.142 --> 24:04.443
- [Patrick's voice]
I ate them.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.078
- What are you talking about?

24:06.145 --> 24:08.047
You know you don't eat.

Now take me home.

My mind must've switched
with Patrick's mind

24:47.486 --> 24:49.756
from the lightning berries.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.424
Flesh and blood and guts.

[gasps]
I've gone analog.

24:57.129 --> 24:59.298

Whoa, whoa.

25:04.203 --> 25:08.340
A living body isn't
so hard to control.

25:10.276 --> 25:14.146
[vocalizes]

25:14.213 --> 25:16.248
- All ready to play.

25:16.315 --> 25:19.719
- This here's the toughest
board game I ever invented.

25:19.786 --> 25:22.421
In order to win,
you need to know math,

25:22.488 --> 25:24.957
science, literature,
and history.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.425

- Well, being in Patrick's body

27:49.201 --> 27:53.773
has opened up senses
that I never had like taste.

Ah, summer camp,

in their own individual way.

32:58.444 --> 32:59.811
[laughter]

32:59.878 --> 33:01.347
Except for this one time

33:01.413 --> 33:05.284
in Kamp Koral
and this one place.

Tonight, for your

[metallic clinking]
Hmm?

33:43.555 --> 33:46.492
Ooh, a quarter!

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

Whew, come back here, you!

Welcome to my
Emporium of Wonders.

Can I interest you
in a traditional

34:40.646 --> 34:43.449
Klopnodian Spladunker?

34:43.514 --> 34:46.185
Or perhaps a lightly
used Flooner?

34:46.252 --> 34:47.585
- No thanks, old timer.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.255
I just want me quarter.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.989
It seems to have hopped
into your pay phone here.

34:52.056 --> 34:53.592
- Oh, I see.

34:53.659 --> 34:55.927
Well I have no power
to retrieve your coin,

34:55.994 --> 34:58.264
but I can let you
have the payphone

34:58.330 --> 35:01.333

I'll take it!

[thunder booms]
[woman screams]

35:09.908 --> 35:12.043
- Really?
How much does the curse cost?

35:12.110 --> 35:14.480
- What?
No, the curse is free.

35:14.546 --> 35:15.714
It comes with the phone.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.115
- Well then!

35:17.183 --> 35:18.684
I'll take the curse, too!

35:21.453 --> 35:24.356
Beware the call of the porch!

35:24.423 --> 35:26.225
Beware!

Ah, forget it.

35:30.028 --> 35:31.563
- [grunting]

35:31.630 --> 35:33.599
Listen up, happy Krustomers!

For the low price of
a quarter, now you, too,

35:36.502 --> 35:38.003
can make that important call

35:38.069 --> 35:40.472
while you're eating
a Krabby Patty!

Ahoy, there. Krusty Krab.

Give them all away!

35:53.952 --> 35:57.256
- [gasps] What kind of obscene
phone call is this?

35:57.323 --> 36:00.058
When I find out who you are,
I'm gonna--

Hey!

No money.

Patties free!

36:14.340 --> 36:15.807
- Free patties?

36:15.874 --> 36:17.609
Oh, Mr. Krabs!

36:17.676 --> 36:20.346
You finally found
your inner generosity.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.909
Oh, boy! A quarter!

36:50.976 --> 36:52.578
I knew this thing

37:06.425 --> 37:09.027
[all clamoring]
Have you gone insane?

37:09.094 --> 37:10.762
Get back in the kitchen
and stitch

37:10.829 --> 37:12.398
these patty halves
back together

37:12.464 --> 37:14.132

38:13.492 --> 38:15.561
- Well, I thought you
told me to, Mr. Krabs.

seem right here.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.760
But like Granny Plankton
always says,

- Um--this town ain't big
enough for the both of us.

42:49.167 --> 42:50.201
[gong splash]

42:50.268 --> 42:52.337
[both yelling]

43:01.647 --> 43:04.282
- Now that's
a good looking baby!

43:06.785 --> 43:08.887
- [neighs]

43:08.954 --> 43:10.956
- Well, this is my stop.

43:11.022 --> 43:12.958
See y'all later!

43:13.024 --> 43:14.893
Hyep!
Giddy-up, now!

43:14.960 --> 43:18.830
- [neighs]
- Yahoo!

43:18.897 --> 43:20.431
- Happy trails!

43:20.498 --> 43:22.768
[electricity zapping]
Ahh!

43:23.501 --> 43:24.469
Ohh!

43:24.535 --> 43:25.971
[crashing]

43:26.037 --> 43:27.673
[groaning]

43:27.739 --> 43:29.307
Uh! Yah!

43:29.374 --> 43:32.510
[playing Polka music]

43:32.577 --> 43:35.480
[groans]

43:35.546 --> 43:36.547
- Bonjour.

43:36.614 --> 43:37.816
- [sighs]

43:37.883 --> 43:40.919
It's good to be back home
where it's normal.

43:40.986 --> 43:42.287
- Hi, Grandpat--
- Huh?

43:42.353 --> 43:44.089
- What you watching?

43:44.155 --> 43:45.390
- [screams]

43:46.925 --> 43:48.727
Ehh, close enough.

43:50.128 --> 43:53.098
- And so we leave things
a little bit weird,

43:53.164 --> 43:57.135
but that's how we like it
here in "The Tidal Zone."

43:57.202 --> 43:58.536
Au revoir.

43:58.603 --> 44:01.172
[static buzzing]
- Hey, I was watching that!
