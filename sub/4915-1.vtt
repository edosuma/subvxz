00:22.590 --> 00:25.190
Ain't but one kind of blues.

00:26.490 --> 00:29.690
And that consisted between

00:30.290 --> 00:33.390
male and female that's in love.

00:34.390 --> 00:38.390
In love, just like
I sung one of them songs a while ago

00:38.590 --> 00:42.690
and I put a verse in there
saying that love hide all fault

00:42.790 --> 00:45.490
and make you do things
you don't wanna do.

00:45.590 --> 00:49.090
Love sometimes
will leave you feeling sad and blue.

00:49.190 --> 00:52.490
I'm talking about the blues!
I ain't talking about monkey junk.

00:52.590 --> 00:56.690
And it consisted
between male and female.

00:56.790 --> 01:02.290
And that means two people,
supposed to be in love

01:02.390 --> 01:04.989
when one or the other

01:05.890 --> 01:10.090
deceives the other through their love.

02:17.190 --> 02:18.290
Ronnie?

02:22.890 --> 02:24.990
Are you okay? Baby?

02:28.090 --> 02:29.790
Baby. Baby.

02:29.890 --> 02:32.190
It's okay. It's okay.

02:32.290 --> 02:35.890
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

02:36.790 --> 02:37.790
It's okay.

02:40.990 --> 02:43.790
I never laid a hand on her in anger.

02:44.490 --> 02:48.190
Not one time, R.L.
Not even when I was drinking.

02:48.290 --> 02:49.790
But this here business
got me wondering

02:49.990 --> 02:51.890
what a good shake and slap
would do for her.

02:52.090 --> 02:53.990
We gonna keep that talk
between us now.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.790
Don't you go in there
with that shit on your tongue.

02:55.890 --> 02:57.790
I ain't start this shit, R.L.

03:00.990 --> 03:03.490
You wanna pray with me
before you go in, Laz?

03:08.190 --> 03:11.990
Heavenly Father, we do not question
your divine plan for us,

03:12.090 --> 03:15.590
but in these times,
when our spirit lies in shadow,

03:15.690 --> 03:18.690
when we are lost,
we ask for your strength.

03:18.790 --> 03:22.390
We ask for strength
to surpass all understanding.

03:22.490 --> 03:25.890
In your name we pray. Amen.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.590
Can't remember the last time
I saw you in that suit.

03:38.690 --> 03:40.490
At your mamma's funeral.

03:41.390 --> 03:42.990
I was a pallbearer, remember?

03:43.090 --> 03:45.590
How about I get you folks some coffee
before I take your order?

03:45.690 --> 03:48.390
We won't be staying long.
Coffee will be fine.

03:51.790 --> 03:54.990
We leaving this weekend.
Deke got a friend in Mobile...

03:55.090 --> 03:56.790
You gonna talk about that motherfucker,

03:56.890 --> 03:58.490
I'm just gonna get up
and leave you sitting here

03:58.590 --> 03:59.890

03:59.990 --> 04:01.990
I thought we was gonna be friendly
about this.

04:02.090 --> 04:03.590
You sneaking around behind my back,

04:03.690 --> 04:06.490
got everybody in town
looking at me like I'm a fool.

04:06.590 --> 04:08.690
What's friendly about that?

04:09.390 --> 04:11.890
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz.

04:11.990 --> 04:15.690
Living with you, I feel it.
Like I'm one foot in the dirt.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.690
Saw what happened to my mamma,
and that's not gonna happen to me.

04:19.790 --> 04:21.290
I got living to do.

04:21.390 --> 04:24.090
And you gonna do that living with him.

04:25.690 --> 04:26.990
Look, Rose,

04:28.290 --> 04:30.990

they do what they can

04:31.090 --> 04:32.990
to get on the mend, get well.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.290
Our marriage, it just done got sick.

04:36.390 --> 04:38.190
Don't talk to me about sick!

04:38.390 --> 04:41.090
I ain't been right
since I moved into that drafty house.

04:41.190 --> 04:42.390
Keeps the heat on.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.290
That damn, rusty radiator
about burned the skin off my legs.

04:45.390 --> 04:48.090
- Kept us warm for 12 years.
- Laz, you can't say nothing that's...

04:48.190 --> 04:50.490
Look, look, look.
Look, maybe we can do like R.L. said,

04:50.590 --> 04:52.690
come down to the church
and get with one of them counselors.

04:52.790 --> 04:54.490
I don't love you no more.

04:59.990 --> 05:01.790
I'm sorry you hurting.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.990
I said my piece.

05:07.590 --> 05:09.090
God forgive you
for what you done to me.

05:09.190 --> 05:10.190
Let me go.

05:10.390 --> 05:12.790
My daddy told me
a younger woman would bleed me dry,

05:12.890 --> 05:13.990
and that's what you've done.

05:14.090 --> 05:16.990
- Laz, I said let...
- You better pray, gal.

05:17.090 --> 05:19.890
You hear me? You best pray.

05:19.990 --> 05:22.090
Don't you lay a curse on me!

05:23.590 --> 05:25.390
Yeah, go on, look.

05:25.490 --> 05:28.390
See if I give a shit
about any of you people!

05:46.690 --> 05:49.090
- You still want a lift?
- Yeah.

05:50.190 --> 05:51.990
Transmission's shot.

06:03.190 --> 06:04.190
Hey.

06:05.690 --> 06:08.290
Make sure you go see my Aunt Lori.
You gotta get rid of that cough.

06:08.390 --> 06:09.990
This ain't gonna work.

06:10.590 --> 06:11.790
- Rae...
- I don't see why we gotta

06:11.990 --> 06:13.990
pretend about it when you and I
both know it ain't gonna work.

06:14.090 --> 06:16.090
- Rae, please don't do this, okay?
- It's stupid!

06:16.290 --> 06:18.390
- Rae. Rae!
- It's so fucking stupid!

06:22.990 --> 06:26.090
Look it. I got something for us, okay?

06:26.190 --> 06:27.790
Give me your hand.

06:29.090 --> 06:30.690
Give me your hand.

06:32.790 --> 06:33.890
Look.

06:40.290 --> 06:41.290
See?

06:41.890 --> 06:45.990
Both these watches are gonna beep
at the same time, every night.

06:46.190 --> 06:50.390
So no matter how far away we are,
we'll be thinking about each other.

06:51.190 --> 06:52.690
Hey, look at me.

06:53.690 --> 06:55.090
Look at me.

06:57.190 --> 07:00.990
I gotta believe we can do this,
or I ain't gonna make it.

07:02.890 --> 07:03.890
Okay.

07:05.190 --> 07:06.790
God, I love you.

07:33.790 --> 07:35.390
Ronnie, wait!

07:37.790 --> 07:38.990
Ronnie!

08:21.990 --> 08:23.090
Fuck.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.090
No, no.

08:58.590 --> 09:00.690
Hey, you got any money?

09:00.790 --> 09:02.590
Thought you had a man for that.

09:02.690 --> 09:04.590
I said we weren't gonna talk about him.

09:04.690 --> 09:06.790
How many times

09:06.890 --> 09:08.490
Look, I ain't calling you
no ho or nothing,

09:08.590 --> 09:10.590
but I ain't gonna let you
play me like no trick, neither.

09:10.690 --> 09:13.990
- Remember, you called me.
- Save it.

09:14.090 --> 09:16.890
Save it for those dumb fuckers
you sell crack to.

09:19.090 --> 09:20.890
How much money you need, ho?

09:20.990 --> 09:22.490
The hell you call me?

09:25.690 --> 09:29.090
You wanna get rough, huh?
Is that what you doing?

09:30.090 --> 09:32.590
Tehronne. Tehronne, let me go.
Let me go!

09:44.990 --> 09:45.990
Bye.

10:30.690 --> 10:31.690
It's already noon, Rae.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.290
You think them shorts
should still be on?

10:33.390 --> 10:37.090
Well, if they weren't, you could
kiss my rebel cootch, you faggot.

10:41.790 --> 10:43.590
Cough drops or condoms?

10:46.390 --> 10:48.490
I didn't know you was working here.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.890
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

10:54.990 --> 10:58.190
I just love getting dressed up
in these goddamn blue vests.

11:02.590 --> 11:05.290
Your meal ticket get shipped out today?

11:09.690 --> 11:12.390
Just let me know
if I can be of any assistance.

11:16.690 --> 11:19.290
Here you go, Linc.
Keep the change on that.

11:20.290 --> 11:21.590
Thanks, Mr. Laz.

11:21.690 --> 11:24.090
But if you wanna tip me,
best do it in butter beans.

11:24.190 --> 11:25.790
Mamma wants a bag of yours.

11:25.890 --> 11:28.190
"None of that store-bought junk."
That's what she said.

11:28.290 --> 11:30.190
All right, you keep the change anyhow.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.390
Come on out to the house,
I'll load you up.

11:32.490 --> 11:33.790
Yes, sir.

12:39.190 --> 12:42.190
Why y'all stop having dances
on Saturday night?

12:42.290 --> 12:45.290
You used to have live bands
and all kind of shit.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.090
Feels like a wake up in here now.

12:47.190 --> 12:51.190
Folks can dance if they want.
I didn't buy that mirror ball for nothing.

12:51.290 --> 12:53.790
Y'all seen my snakeskin shoes?

12:53.890 --> 12:56.290
- They from New York.
- Yeah.

12:56.390 --> 12:58.590
My niece,
she gets them on the computer.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.590
- Is that right?
- They got blue snakes up north?

13:03.390 --> 13:06.090
No. They got blue dye, though.

13:06.190 --> 13:09.390
You think them boots on your feet
come from a black cow?

13:09.490 --> 13:12.190
You wanna get on somebody
about live music?

13:12.290 --> 13:13.990
Get on old Laz there.

13:14.090 --> 13:17.090
He the one who got this joint shaking
back in the day.

13:17.190 --> 13:19.190
You ain't gotta tell me.

13:19.290 --> 13:20.890
Me and my girlfriends,

13:20.990 --> 13:24.090
we used to talk about
how hard his fingertips get

13:24.190 --> 13:26.490
just picking that guitar.

13:26.590 --> 13:29.190
They hard from picking peas,
not strings.

13:29.290 --> 13:30.990
And they still hard.

13:32.490 --> 13:37.190
Mayella, it ain't never happened.
It damn sure ain't gonna happen tonight.

13:37.290 --> 13:39.390
Oh, Laz, I know you hurting.

13:39.490 --> 13:41.390
But you should know more than me,

13:41.490 --> 13:45.390
ain't no better cure for the blues
than some good pussy.

13:54.990 --> 13:57.490
Now that's a whole lot of woman
right there.

13:57.590 --> 13:58.690
Yeah.

13:58.790 --> 14:01.190
She sure do like to spread it around.

14:04.890 --> 14:06.090
Hey, Laz.

14:06.890 --> 14:08.790
Me and you friends and all,

14:08.890 --> 14:12.290
but promise me
you'll keep your cool in my joint.

14:18.890 --> 14:21.690
- I'm gonna finish my beer.
- All right then.

14:25.590 --> 14:27.090
Mind if I sit?

14:34.590 --> 14:38.690
Rose said that
it didn't go too well this afternoon.

14:39.490 --> 14:41.690
See, I told her. I said, "Rose,

14:41.790 --> 14:44.590
"we ain't leaving
till we make peace with Laz."

14:44.690 --> 14:47.390
And that's the God's truth. I laid it down.

14:47.490 --> 14:49.690
- You laid it down?
- I did.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.690
That's funny.

14:52.490 --> 14:54.990
You laying it down for my wife.

14:55.090 --> 14:57.390
You think I wanna hurt you, Laz?

14:57.990 --> 15:00.790
- Man, I'd take a bullet for you!
- Would you now?

15:00.890 --> 15:03.190
We can put that to the test.

15:03.390 --> 15:07.590
Say, Bo, would you still got that
little.22 over behind the bar?

15:07.690 --> 15:09.690
My little brother here say
he'd take a bullet for me.

15:09.790 --> 15:12.190
All right now, slow your roll now.

15:14.890 --> 15:17.490
You come in here
to ease your heart, huh?

15:18.190 --> 15:20.590
Well, I ain't gonna help you do that.

15:20.690 --> 15:22.690
You took her into your bed,

15:24.390 --> 15:26.390
now you got to lay in it.

15:32.990 --> 15:34.990
I'll always love you, Laz.

15:35.590 --> 15:37.390
Till the end of my days.

15:39.690 --> 15:42.190
- Laz, what you doing, man?
- Laz, God damn it!

15:42.290 --> 15:44.390
Cain slew Abel.

15:44.490 --> 15:46.390
Slew him out of envy.

15:46.490 --> 15:49.390
God put his mark on Cain for his sins.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.590
Is that what you want, Deke?
Huh? Is that what you come here for?

15:52.690 --> 15:56.690
I'll do it for you.
All you got to do is say it again.

15:57.490 --> 15:58.990
Say you love me.

15:59.990 --> 16:01.890
Say you love me, nigger!

16:28.090 --> 16:30.390
- Ronnie ship out this morning?
- Yeah. He's so stupid.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.390
Why do you think he's stupid?

16:31.590 --> 16:34.190
He told me he don't want nothing to do
with no military career.

16:34.290 --> 16:38.190
He wants to go up in Knoxville,
start an auto body shop with his uncle.

16:38.290 --> 16:41.490
- I said, "Let's go! Let's do it now!"
- Really?

16:41.590 --> 16:44.990
Shit, Ronnie knows cars.
Fixed that Buick for my Uncle Dale.

16:45.090 --> 16:48.890
Then he starts talking all this shit
about honor and duty. I swear.

16:48.990 --> 16:50.890
If he gets hurt up there,
I'm gonna kill him.

16:50.990 --> 16:52.990
It's not like you're married.
He ain't even proposed.

16:53.090 --> 16:54.390
He don't give a shit about me.

16:54.490 --> 16:57.090
I begged him not to go.
I fucking begged him.

16:57.190 --> 16:58.690
Oh, my God!

17:08.290 --> 17:10.290
Hey, you all right?

17:10.390 --> 17:12.690
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- You wanna go home?

17:12.790 --> 17:16.290
No, it just gets worse there,
leaving me to my own head.

17:25.790 --> 17:27.890
- Better?
- Yeah.

17:27.990 --> 17:30.590
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey, Batson.

17:30.690 --> 17:32.690
You Robotripping tonight?

17:32.790 --> 17:34.990
No, but I will smoke that joint.

17:35.090 --> 17:38.290
Well, check this out.
I got eight packs of DXM.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.590
I got OxyContin.

17:39.690 --> 17:43.390
I got a whole shitload of Coricidin
if you wanna get out-of-body and all.

17:43.490 --> 17:46.290
Coricidin? You're just trying to get me
out of my clothes.

17:46.390 --> 17:48.690
- I'll be right back, okay?
- All right.

17:51.790 --> 17:54.790
- Hey.
- What you want?

17:56.490 --> 17:58.990
Ain't no reason I can't go out
and have fun with my friends.

17:59.090 --> 18:01.590
What, you think
I'm Ronnie's spy or something?

18:02.590 --> 18:05.190
Come tomorrow, his dumb ass
gonna be halfway around the world

18:05.290 --> 18:07.890
trying to keep his head
on his shoulders.

18:08.390 --> 18:10.990
You think
he's gonna be thinking about you?

18:12.590 --> 18:14.090
You go to hell.

18:17.290 --> 18:19.890
Hey, how many to get me fucked up?

19:58.090 --> 20:01.390
Just like a bird without a feather

20:06.390 --> 20:09.690
You know I'm lost without your love

20:14.790 --> 20:18.090
Just like a bird without a feather

20:22.790 --> 20:25.690
You know I'm lost without your love

20:30.490 --> 20:33.090
You know I need your lovin'

20:34.690 --> 20:37.990
Just like the angels need heaven above

20:46.090 --> 20:48.190
Well, I done shot that woman

20:51.490 --> 20:54.690
Shot her 'cause she done me wrong

21:02.490 --> 21:05.790
Yeah, I love that woman

21:07.390 --> 21:10.690
Says she ain't love no one but me

21:18.790 --> 21:21.990
Yeah, but I caught that woman cheatin'

21:24.490 --> 21:27.690
Now our home ain't where it used to be

21:42.890 --> 21:43.890
Jess!

21:47.390 --> 21:50.190
Jess! Jess!

21:57.190 --> 21:58.190
Stop!

22:00.190 --> 22:01.690
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop what?

22:01.790 --> 22:04.790
Stop. I'm spinning. Don't.

22:09.590 --> 22:12.090
Oh, God, that feels so much better.

22:27.290 --> 22:29.090
Come on, I'll take you home.

22:43.090 --> 22:45.490
Thought you had
some shorts on earlier.

22:46.690 --> 22:48.190
I got others.

22:50.090 --> 22:51.490
This thing you got...

22:57.090 --> 23:00.990
I've heard people say you'd fuck a tree
if it was handy. I can see that.

23:02.390 --> 23:05.490
But that nigger, Tehronne?

23:10.190 --> 23:11.890
He thinks he's some player

23:11.990 --> 23:15.090
'cause he hustles dope
and stolen hubcaps, I mean,

23:15.190 --> 23:17.690
I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?

23:18.290 --> 23:20.190
I begged him not to go.

23:21.890 --> 23:23.090
But he went.

23:23.190 --> 23:24.890
I begged him.

23:24.990 --> 23:26.790
I bet you did.

23:26.890 --> 23:29.490
Just had to get
that black cock up in you.

23:38.490 --> 23:39.890
That's not...

23:42.890 --> 23:44.990
What the fuck you laughing at?

23:45.090 --> 23:47.890
You ain't got a half
of what Tehronne got.

23:50.590 --> 23:52.090
Not a half.

23:59.890 --> 24:01.090
Get up!

24:02.090 --> 24:03.690
I ain't playing!

24:05.790 --> 24:08.590
You gotta open your goddamn eyes!
God damn it!

24:19.590 --> 24:20.990
Jesus Christ.

24:44.890 --> 24:46.590
Hey, man, wake up.

25:15.690 --> 25:17.690
- Lazarus.
- Bojo called.

25:18.390 --> 25:22.990
Said you got to see your brother
at the long end of a broken bottle.

25:23.690 --> 25:27.190
What, you call to preach me
about turning the other cheek now?

25:27.290 --> 25:30.890
I think you did all right by God,
under the circumstances.

25:32.790 --> 25:36.190
Your people are here for you, Laz.
This is your home.

25:36.290 --> 25:38.790
Ain't no shame
in showing your face around here.

25:38.890 --> 25:40.390
Yeah, all right.

25:42.590 --> 25:43.690
Shit.

27:24.890 --> 27:26.090
Oh, shit!

27:45.390 --> 27:46.690
Little lady?

27:47.790 --> 27:49.690
Little lady, listen to me. Miss.

27:49.790 --> 27:53.090
Miss, now, I need you to open
your eyes for me, all right?

27:53.290 --> 27:56.090
Come on now. Open your eyes.
Now, you can do that for me, can't you?

27:56.190 --> 27:58.190
Come on. Come on.

27:58.290 --> 28:00.190
There you go. Just like that.

28:00.290 --> 28:01.390
That's good.

28:01.490 --> 28:03.090
- Tehronne.
- Huh?

28:03.190 --> 28:05.790
- Tehronne.
- Tehronne?

28:06.790 --> 28:09.190
He did... He did... He didn't do this to...

28:12.090 --> 28:13.490
It's all right.

28:15.790 --> 28:19.690
I'm fixing to go to town and get
some medicines so I can fix you up.

28:20.790 --> 28:22.790
You just rest, all right?

28:23.890 --> 28:25.990
Just try to get some sleep.

28:26.890 --> 28:28.890
Take that chill off of you.

28:30.990 --> 28:32.190
God damn.

29:06.390 --> 29:09.790
- Lazarus?
- Miss Angie. You gave me a start.

29:09.890 --> 29:13.290
I'm sorry, it's these soft shoes
I wear for my back.

29:13.390 --> 29:15.690
- You hurt your back?
- No, no, I'm standing most of my day.

29:15.790 --> 29:17.690
They're just for support.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.790
Didn't see you in church this morning.

29:19.890 --> 29:23.590
Oh, I'm real busy with the crops.

29:23.690 --> 29:27.390
And if I don't work on Sunday,
then I have to hire some extra hands.

29:27.490 --> 29:30.090
Well, it's good to see you.

29:31.090 --> 29:32.590
Look here, Miss Angela,

29:33.490 --> 29:37.090
my little niece,
she got a real bad cough.

29:37.290 --> 29:39.990
- You take her to a doctor?
- No.

29:40.090 --> 29:42.990
She can't go...
Well, ain't no money for a doctor.

29:43.090 --> 29:46.590
Her daddy off work
and he asked me to take care of her.

29:47.990 --> 29:50.290
I don't... I don't know what to do.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.790
You wait right here.

31:24.890 --> 31:27.690
Is your niece older than 12?

31:27.790 --> 31:30.890
Okay. My sister got a bad cough
with her pneumonia

31:30.990 --> 31:32.490
so I just copied her prescription.

31:32.590 --> 31:35.490
You don t need to pay anything.
Just take it.

31:35.590 --> 31:38.390
And if she gets worse,
you give me a call.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.490
I put my number on the bottle.

31:44.290 --> 31:46.190
You ain't gonna get into no trouble
about this, is you?

31:46.290 --> 31:48.090
Not if no one finds out.

32:05.490 --> 32:08.190
Hey, Laz.
You know we closed on Sunday, man.

32:08.290 --> 32:10.390
I need to talk to Tehronne.

32:10.790 --> 32:12.190
Yo, T!

32:13.690 --> 32:15.790
Laz wanna holla at you, man.

32:16.190 --> 32:17.890
Come on back, Cuz.

32:19.690 --> 32:23.490
You call it a game
when one man wins each time?

32:25.090 --> 32:27.490
I call it a motherfucking shame.

32:28.890 --> 32:31.290
- What you want?
- Can I get a word?

32:33.390 --> 32:34.590
Come on.

32:43.090 --> 32:46.590
- You want some weed?
- No, man, I don't mess with that stuff.

32:47.990 --> 32:50.490
You know a white girl about yay high,

32:50.690 --> 32:53.290
dirty blonde hair
split down the middle like?

32:53.490 --> 32:55.390
That ain't up to me to hook you up, pop.

32:55.590 --> 32:57.490
- She on her own, you know?
- Huh?

32:57.590 --> 32:59.690
I don't pimp that.

32:59.790 --> 33:01.990
But if you talking about
who I think you talking about,

33:02.090 --> 33:04.790
you talking about Rae. Rae Doole.

33:05.590 --> 33:07.890
Sexy little split tail, like you say.

33:08.490 --> 33:11.990
Can't hook you up with that.
But I do got two ho.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.790
One of them ain't in town

33:13.890 --> 33:16.790
and the other one pregnant,
so you on your own.

33:17.490 --> 33:20.190
Well, this Rae, you get with her?

33:20.290 --> 33:23.090
- Shit, man, who ain't fucked her?
- What you mean?

33:23.190 --> 33:26.590
Man, she got a spare minute,
she snatch up anybody.

33:26.690 --> 33:30.090
Sometime she needs the real deal,
so she calls me up.

33:30.790 --> 33:33.790
Girl got a itch, you know?
What's a nigger to do?

33:35.890 --> 33:39.390
Now this girl, Rae, she like it rough?

33:39.490 --> 33:40.990
You know, like beating on her
or whatnot?

33:41.090 --> 33:42.290
That ain't my scene.

33:42.390 --> 33:44.090
- That something you into?
- No.

33:44.190 --> 33:47.090
See, look, nigger, that girl's in my favor.

33:47.190 --> 33:49.390
You fuck with her rough,
you got me to fuck with.

33:49.490 --> 33:52.290
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Collar that dog, boy.

33:52.390 --> 33:55.390
I don't wanna mess with her.
I just wanna know who she is, that's all.

33:55.490 --> 33:59.390
Like I say, you wanna hook up with that,
I ain't in your way.

33:59.490 --> 34:02.390
That switch of hers
been all over town anyway.

34:02.490 --> 34:05.390
- She got that sickness, you know?
- What sickness?

34:06.290 --> 34:10.790
What I'm saying is,
she gotta get dick or she goes crazy.

34:12.889 --> 34:14.889
Get my money ready, nigger.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.290
Miss?

34:21.590 --> 34:22.889
Miss Rae?

34:24.690 --> 34:26.590
Hey! Hey, you hear me?

34:29.590 --> 34:31.389
Come here. Come on.

34:37.590 --> 34:41.090
Hey, listen to me.
Look me in the eye now. Come on.

34:41.190 --> 34:42.690
Look at me.

34:42.790 --> 34:45.590
See, ain't no harm here. Ain't no harm.

34:45.690 --> 34:47.690
All I wanna do is get you well.

34:48.489 --> 34:51.790
My name is Lazarus. Lazarus Redd.

34:51.889 --> 34:54.690
- Lazarus.
- That's right. My name is Lazarus.

34:54.790 --> 34:56.290

34:56.389 --> 34:59.590
And I'm gonna take good care of you,
all right? Okay?

35:06.990 --> 35:09.690
Lazarus! Lazarus!

35:10.590 --> 35:11.790
Lazarus!

35:12.290 --> 35:14.590
Get off me! Get off me!

35:17.990 --> 35:20.890
See if I give a shit

35:43.090 --> 35:46.390
Lazarus! Lazarus!

35:47.090 --> 35:49.090
Lazarus!

36:33.590 --> 36:36.190
I know. I know it hurts. I know it hurts!

36:36.290 --> 36:37.790
We gotta break that fever!

36:37.890 --> 36:39.690
I ain't gonna let you die!

36:39.790 --> 36:42.390
I ain't letting you die!

36:42.490 --> 36:43.990
Now breathe.

36:44.490 --> 36:47.290
Come on. Breathe now. Calm down.

36:49.790 --> 36:52.390
There you go. You cooling off already.

36:52.890 --> 36:56.590
Girl, you put the fear of the devil in me.

36:57.190 --> 37:00.890
I was scared as a kid
on Halloween night in the graveyard.

37:23.990 --> 37:25.090
Ronnie?

37:32.390 --> 37:33.490
Ronnie?

37:36.290 --> 37:38.790
Ronnie, where did you go?
Where did you go?

37:39.990 --> 37:41.390
Where did you go?

37:42.190 --> 37:45.190
Where did you go, Ronnie?
Where did you go?

37:47.190 --> 37:48.290
Ronnie?

37:49.190 --> 37:50.390
Ronnie?

37:52.590 --> 37:55.090
Ronnie!

37:57.890 --> 37:59.590
Ronnie!

37:59.690 --> 38:01.290
Say, gal...

38:01.390 --> 38:02.490
Hey.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.690
Is you hearing the sound of my voice?

38:06.590 --> 38:08.490
You traveling now, girl.

38:09.490 --> 38:12.190
Why don't you come on back
in the house with me now?

38:12.290 --> 38:13.890
Come on now.

38:13.990 --> 38:15.090
Come on!

38:15.190 --> 38:17.690
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, you all right?

38:17.790 --> 38:21.890
Whoa, whoa, whoa now.
Come on. Hey, hey.

38:27.090 --> 38:29.690
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

38:29.890 --> 38:31.890
Come on. Come on.

38:34.690 --> 38:36.790
You all right. You all right.

38:45.090 --> 38:48.090
It's all right now. It's okay.
Just rest, all right.

38:51.490 --> 38:52.790
It's okay.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.890
It's okay.

38:55.990 --> 38:57.790
- Oh, no, no, no.
- It's okay.

38:58.590 --> 39:01.590
Hey. Hey.
We ain't gonna do that, all right?

39:03.290 --> 39:06.090
Here you go, Rae. You're safe now.

39:07.390 --> 39:09.490
Listen. Listen. Listen here.

39:10.190 --> 39:12.090
I went

39:13.690 --> 39:16.190
Down to the church house

39:17.990 --> 39:19.990
I heard a voice

39:20.990 --> 39:23.190
Tell me to pray

39:24.090 --> 39:27.090
I got down on my knees

39:27.990 --> 39:30.790
But I had no words to say

39:32.190 --> 39:34.290
No words to say

39:35.890 --> 39:37.990
You know I could not pray

40:42.390 --> 40:45.490
If I, I was a catfish

40:46.490 --> 40:49.390
Swimming, Lord, in the deep blue sea

40:50.190 --> 40:53.590
I'd have all you big leg women

40:53.690 --> 40:55.790
Fishing after me

40:55.890 --> 40:57.490
Fishing after me

41:01.790 --> 41:05.490
Well, there's two, two trains runnin'

41:06.190 --> 41:08.890
They run, they run my way

41:09.490 --> 41:11.790
You know one run 'round midnight

41:11.990 --> 41:14.490
The other run just 'fore day,
just 'fore day

41:15.290 --> 41:18.190
That train, Lord, took my baby away

41:18.890 --> 41:20.790
Took my baby away

42:17.090 --> 42:18.890
Whoa, whoa, whoa, now.

42:19.990 --> 42:22.190
Just take it easy. Don't go too fast.

42:22.890 --> 42:24.790
How long I been out?

42:24.890 --> 42:27.990
You been in and out, I don't know,
I guess two days.

42:28.990 --> 42:30.090
Two days?

42:30.190 --> 42:32.790
Well, you wake up in spells, you know.

42:32.890 --> 42:35.790
Just long enough to get
some of this medicine in you.

42:36.890 --> 42:38.890
Can you turn that shit off?

42:39.690 --> 42:40.990
Oh, yeah.

42:47.690 --> 42:50.090
Found you out by the side of the road.

42:50.190 --> 42:53.490
Looked like somebody
took to beating on you pretty bad.

42:53.590 --> 42:55.990
You know who done that to you?

42:56.090 --> 42:58.590
- Where's Ronnie?
- I don't know who that is.

42:58.790 --> 43:01.190
No, wait, wait. He left.

43:06.090 --> 43:09.890
I don't got any money or anything,
you know, for fixing me up.

43:09.990 --> 43:11.890
I don't need none.

43:11.990 --> 43:14.190
I guess I best be on my way.

43:14.290 --> 43:17.490
- I think we need to talk some.
- No, sir.

43:17.590 --> 43:18.690
I gotta be on my way.

43:18.790 --> 43:21.290
Best to get your wits about you before...

43:24.890 --> 43:26.890
I wanted to tell you about that.

43:27.990 --> 43:29.890
Why you got me chained?

43:39.590 --> 43:41.190
What the fuck you been doing to me?

43:41.290 --> 43:43.690
I ain't laid a hand on you,
except to break your fever.

43:43.790 --> 43:46.090
- Like I said...
- Get this goddamn chain off me!

43:46.190 --> 43:48.790
Look, girl, you been running wild on me!

43:48.890 --> 43:51.390
Between them fits
and them fever dreams you having,

43:51.490 --> 43:53.390
I been chasing you
all over this place at night.

43:53.490 --> 43:55.890
Well, I'm woke now.
You can take this off.

43:58.490 --> 44:01.190
No. You ain't right yet.

44:01.290 --> 44:04.090
I'm right enough
to stand on my own two feet.

44:04.190 --> 44:06.590
Now get this goddamn chain off me!

44:07.990 --> 44:10.590
Why you let them mens
treat you like that?

44:11.890 --> 44:12.890
What?

44:12.990 --> 44:16.490
All them mens you up under,
why you let them do you like that?

44:19.390 --> 44:21.390
What the hell you know about me?

44:22.590 --> 44:24.590
You ain't got no right
to talk to me about that shit!

44:24.690 --> 44:27.090
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- I saved your life, girl!

44:27.190 --> 44:29.990
I can do or say whatever the fuck I want!

44:31.690 --> 44:34.690
Now, I done give you enough chain
so you can get around the house here.

44:34.790 --> 44:37.790
You can get to the kitchen.
Bathroom, back yonder.

44:37.890 --> 44:39.590
You got enough food around here.

44:39.690 --> 44:42.690
A few more swallows left
in that medicine over there.

44:42.790 --> 44:47.590
Whatever you want, you know,
if you wanna have me, you can take me.

44:47.690 --> 44:52.390
I'll do whatever you like.
Just, when you're done, I gotta go.

44:52.490 --> 44:55.990
You know?
'Cause I can't stay here with you.

44:56.090 --> 44:59.390
God seen fit to put you in my path.

45:00.490 --> 45:03.690
And I aim to cure you
of your wickedness.

45:07.590 --> 45:10.590
- You some kind of pervert?
- No, ma'am.

45:10.690 --> 45:13.090
Some crazy Jesus freak,
gonna fuck the spirit into me?

45:13.190 --> 45:15.390
You watch your tongue in my house!

45:15.490 --> 45:17.290
- Look it, mister...
- Now, you sick!

45:17.390 --> 45:19.690
- You got a sickness!
- Look it, mister...

45:19.790 --> 45:21.890
- We done broke the fever.
- I will do whatever you want.

45:21.990 --> 45:24.190
Now, we gonna break the hold
the devil got on you!

45:24.290 --> 45:26.590
I can't stay here! I can't stay here!

45:29.190 --> 45:30.290
Help!

45:39.590 --> 45:41.490
Somebody help me!

46:00.190 --> 46:02.190
We ain't gonna be moved.

46:08.990 --> 46:10.790
Listen here, gal.

46:11.590 --> 46:13.890
I ain't gonna be moved on this.

46:16.890 --> 46:18.090
Help!

46:21.390 --> 46:22.990
Let me go!

46:23.090 --> 46:26.390
You can holler all you want.
Ain't nobody gonna hear you.

46:26.490 --> 46:28.590
Ain't gonna bend my will, neither.

46:29.190 --> 46:30.490
Right or wrong,

46:32.490 --> 46:33.890
you gonna mind me.

46:33.990 --> 46:37.090
Like Jesus says, I'm gonna suffer you.

46:37.190 --> 46:38.790
I'm gonna suffer you!

46:39.890 --> 46:42.090
Get your ass back in my house!

46:46.390 --> 46:47.590
Or what?

46:49.790 --> 46:50.990
Or what?

47:16.690 --> 47:19.890
- Quit it! It hurts!
- Now, whose doing is that?

47:30.290 --> 47:32.390
God damn it! Okay!

47:42.590 --> 47:43.990
You hungry?

47:56.290 --> 47:59.090
I put a lot of backache
into growing them greens.

48:00.190 --> 48:02.490
Some love into cooking the rest of it.

48:03.290 --> 48:05.890
If you slow down,
you might taste some of it.

48:24.890 --> 48:26.390
Oh, you like this?

48:26.590 --> 48:28.990
Walking me through this field all day
like I was your mule?

48:29.090 --> 48:31.190
Can't lay around on the sofa all day.

48:31.390 --> 48:33.190
Gotta get your legs strong.

48:33.290 --> 48:35.990
If I break one, you gonna shoot me?

48:55.790 --> 48:58.590
My daddy was one of the first mens
in these parts

48:58.690 --> 49:01.390
to start a soil conservation group.

49:01.490 --> 49:05.790
They got a group of farmers together,
every year they rotate the crops.

49:06.790 --> 49:08.690
Know why they do that?

49:09.690 --> 49:11.590
Keep the soil healthy.

49:12.890 --> 49:15.190
- That sting?
- Itches.

49:15.290 --> 49:17.190
That mean it's healing.

49:19.890 --> 49:24.890
Now, I done seen it in nature
and I done seen it in men.

49:26.190 --> 49:29.690
You gots to change, rotate the crop.

49:29.790 --> 49:32.690
Gotta have change,
else that seed won't take.

49:32.790 --> 49:34.990
Hell, girl, you gotta cut that shit out.

49:35.090 --> 49:37.190
Laying up under all them fools,

49:37.390 --> 49:39.590
rutting on you
like you some bitch in heat,

49:39.690 --> 49:41.290
like you somebody's dog.

49:41.390 --> 49:46.390
A man or woman
that enters into union with Almighty God

49:46.490 --> 49:48.090
in the sanctity of marriage,

49:48.190 --> 49:51.890
should not demean theyselves
by bending to another's will.

49:51.990 --> 49:53.790
Hell, girl, is you crazy?

49:53.890 --> 49:56.990
I ain't no saint. I ain't saying I ain't weak.

49:57.090 --> 50:00.590
I mean, playing guitar
in them blood-bucket jukes all your life,

50:00.690 --> 50:01.990
a nigger learn how to sin.

50:02.090 --> 50:05.190
And I do got sin in me.
I ain't gonna lie about that.

50:05.290 --> 50:06.990
But I got respect!

50:07.090 --> 50:09.790
And all you got in you is bile!
Just bile!

50:09.890 --> 50:12.790
Running around behind my back,
whoring with my brother!

50:12.890 --> 50:14.890
- Killing my baby!
- Get off!

50:32.790 --> 50:35.190
I didn't mean to go off like that.

50:37.690 --> 50:40.490
Why you old men gotta talk so much?

50:40.590 --> 50:43.190
You gotta talk yourself into fucking me?

50:43.390 --> 50:44.890
Like little boys.

50:46.390 --> 50:49.390
It's okay. I'm grown. I know.

50:50.490 --> 50:51.990
We can go slow.

50:54.890 --> 50:57.190
You gonna give me another bath?

52:58.190 --> 53:01.090
Well, Archie, there goes our fortune.

53:01.190 --> 53:04.190
Laz, we've been doing good
since you been away.

53:07.090 --> 53:09.290
What time Ella Mae's open up?

53:09.390 --> 53:11.790
You needing to buy some pantyhose?

53:12.790 --> 53:14.890
Couple of dresses, actually.

53:35.090 --> 53:38.390
- May I help you, sir?
- Yessum.

53:38.490 --> 53:42.090
I'm looking to get some things
for a woman.

53:42.190 --> 53:46.690
You know, some dresses and such
and maybe some shoes.

53:46.790 --> 53:50.990
But they gotta be nice things,
you know, proper things for a woman.

53:51.090 --> 53:54.290
You know, things that make a woman
feel like a woman

53:54.390 --> 53:57.690
and not look like a hussy or a floozy.

53:59.290 --> 54:01.690
Well, that makes it easier.

54:18.190 --> 54:19.490
Hello?

54:21.090 --> 54:22.190
Hey!

54:24.290 --> 54:25.590
Asshole.

55:00.490 --> 55:03.090
I just wanted to bring something
to show my appreciation.

55:03.190 --> 55:06.090
Some squash, tomatoes,
corn, butter beans.

55:06.190 --> 55:07.790
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

55:07.990 --> 55:10.690
Well, my niece is all better now,
thanks to you.

55:10.790 --> 55:12.890
That's good. I'm happy to hear it.

55:12.990 --> 55:16.090
Oh, and I put something special in here.

55:16.890 --> 55:19.590
This whipped body cream.
Got a scent to it.

55:22.890 --> 55:25.190
That there is ginger soufflÃ©.

55:25.290 --> 55:29.890
Say, you put it on
after a hot bath or shower,

55:29.990 --> 55:33.090
it'll make you soft, smell good.

55:33.190 --> 55:35.190
That's real sweet of you.

55:35.290 --> 55:37.790
Just hope you enjoy it.

55:37.890 --> 55:39.290
Thank you.

55:50.090 --> 55:51.190
Mr. Lazarus!

55:54.590 --> 55:55.890
Hey, Mr. Laz!

56:00.390 --> 56:02.490
I come for the butter beans!

56:11.790 --> 56:12.990
Mr. Laz?

56:43.290 --> 56:44.890
Mr. Laz, you in there?

57:46.890 --> 57:48.090
Mr. Laz!

57:49.390 --> 57:51.090
I'm coming inside!

58:27.290 --> 58:28.990
There now! Hush up!

58:38.590 --> 58:41.990
God damn! Girl, I can't leave you alone
for a minute!

58:42.090 --> 58:44.490
Get your ass away from around here!

58:47.790 --> 58:49.690
Lincoln. Lincoln!

58:59.190 --> 59:01.790
Was that Lincoln James
I seen running off?

59:04.390 --> 59:06.190
Why his britches down
around his knees?

59:07.590 --> 59:09.090
R.L., you gonna have to get on.

59:10.590 --> 59:12.790
Can't have nobody around my place.

59:12.890 --> 59:14.790
You get a call from Rose?

59:14.890 --> 59:16.390
This ain't got nothing to do
with that woman.

59:16.490 --> 59:18.690
I just don't wanna be bothered
with nobody right now.

59:18.790 --> 59:22.590
Something wrong with your phone?
I been trying to call you for a few days.

59:22.690 --> 59:24.290
Going dove hunting?

59:24.390 --> 59:27.990
R.L., now I done told you to get on.
I ain't playing.

59:33.990 --> 59:36.790
You saying that gun is for me if I don't.

59:36.890 --> 59:40.090
I ain't letting you
talk me out of shit no more, R.L.

59:40.190 --> 59:43.390
I done made up my mind on this,
I ain't gonna be moved.

59:44.390 --> 59:45.490
"Ain't gonna be moved."

59:45.590 --> 59:47.890
There ain't no room
for preaching around here no more!

59:47.990 --> 59:49.590
Now, I done told you to get on!

59:49.690 --> 59:51.290
- Or what?
- Go on now!

59:53.390 --> 59:55.390
Go on. Shoot me.

59:56.090 --> 59:57.590
Shoot me, killer.

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:03.890
I ought to stomp your ass,
pointing this thing at me.

01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:08.490
Damn it, Laz.

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.090
I know we ain't blood,
but we was raised like brothers,

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:13.690
since the very first day
we was slapped on the ass.

01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:15.990
Now you gonna go point a gun at me?

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:25.290
If you were in some kind of trouble,
then we gonna figure something out.

01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:26.890
You and me.

01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:33.390
Here. Go on, wipe your face off.

01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:42.690
This got something to do with Rose?

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:46.390
Then what?

01:00:57.290 --> 01:00:58.990
I didn't wanna do it.

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:10.490
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:11.790
Man in your line of work

01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:14.590
ought to not use the Lord's name in vain
like you just did.

01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:16.690
A half-naked white woman
chained up in your house!

01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:20.790
Now look here, I found that girl beat on
and left for dead out on the road!

01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:22.390
I just brung her home!

01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:24.190
Laz, I know that girl!

01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:28.290
She had a whole mess of crabs
and STDs! What you thinking?

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:31.990
I swear on my mamma's grave, R.L.,
I ain't touched that girl.

01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:33.690
My wick dry on this.

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:43.290
You say she was beat on.
You call the Sheriff on this?

01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:47.190
R.L., now put yourself in my place.

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:49.890
You out here by yourself with,
as you say,

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:53.190
a half-naked white woman
who love to fuck.

01:01:53.290 --> 01:01:56.190
Now, I done been toe to toe
with the law in this town a heap of times

01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:58.290
just for being black and nearby.

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:03.590
- What's that chain around her waist for?
- Go on in there and ask her.

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:08.090
Now this girl been rut on
and beat on all her days.

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:11.390
She need to talk to somebody
with some sense and some reasoning.

01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:12.690
That's you.

01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:15.790
Just go in there and talk to her.

01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:18.990
Please.

01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:26.790
And I'm fixing steaks for supper.

01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:29.790
I expect you to stay.

01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:33.890
You expect me to sit down and eat with
that woman chained up the way she is?

01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:36.590
R.L., you watch yourself in there.

01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:39.890
That gal be on your dick
like stank on shit.

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:48.790
Lincoln.

01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:51.590
Come here, boy. Come on.

01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:56.090
- I ain't hurt you none, did I?
- No, sir.

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:58.290
Look here.

01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:03.290
What happened up yonder at the house,
that wasn't your fault.

01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:05.790
Ain't a young man alive
could've kept his pants on

01:03:05.890 --> 01:03:08.290
with that girl in heat like she is.

01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:10.190
Why she got a chain on her?

01:03:10.290 --> 01:03:13.790
Well, now, that's between me and her,
that's private.

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:16.490
So,

01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:21.090
- that your first time?
- Yes, sir.

01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:24.890
Shit! I remember my first time

01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:27.890
was out behind my uncle's barn
with my second cousin.

01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:33.590
Man, that girl must've weighed two tons
if she weighed a pound.

01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:36.290
Could've done a lot better for myself.

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:38.990
Hell, look like you sure enough did.

01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:44.190
- You want a cigarette?
- No, sir.

01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:46.890
That's usually what you do
when you get through, you know.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.290
You either smoke
or leave them smoking.

01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:57.590
- You a preacher?
- That's right.

01:03:59.390 --> 01:04:01.090
Can I ask you a question?

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:07.090
You know how people are always
saying, you gotta get right with Jesus

01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:08.990
if you want not to go to hell, you know.

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:13.190
Gotta say you're sorry
and Jesus will let you into heaven.

01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:16.590
You can put it that way.

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:18.790
That's so fucking stupid.

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:21.890
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to curse. I just...

01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:24.990
No, no, no. What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?

01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:29.890
You can't go around hurting people
and then just

01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:32.690
say you're sorry
and it all gets washed away.

01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:36.190
Why would heaven
want people like that?

01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:44.290
I'm gonna tell you something,

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:47.490
and it's just gonna be
between you and me.

01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:50.790
I think folks
carry on about heaven too much.

01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:54.890
Like it's some kind of
all-you-can-eat buffet up in the clouds,

01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:57.090
and folks just do as they're told

01:04:57.190 --> 01:05:00.290
so they can eat what they want
behind some pearly gates.

01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:09.190
There's sin in my heart.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:13.090
There's evil in the world.

01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:17.190
But when I got no one, I talk to God.

01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:21.090
I ask for strength.

01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:23.190
I ask for forgiveness.

01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:26.590
Not peace at the end of my days
when I got no more life to live

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:29.190
or no more good to do, but today.

01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:31.890
Right now.

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:38.690
What's your heaven?

01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:45.590
Ronnie.

01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:20.290
Holy shit.

01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:30.290
Hey, Jim, let's get Ronnie set up here.

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:34.290
Thank you.

01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:37.890
Hey, Herman.

01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:41.590
Hey, Ronnie.
They buy you that Big Chicken Dinner?

01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:45.590
The what?

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:48.590
They got different names
for things in the Corps

01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:50.590
when they trying to get rid of you.

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:52.490
I don't know what it's like in the Guard,

01:06:52.590 --> 01:06:57.390
but there's a thing called the
Bad Conduct Discharge, a BCD.

01:06:57.490 --> 01:07:00.390
It's not the same as the brig,
but it'll sure fuck you up for life

01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:03.290
if you ever wanna work
for the government.

01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:05.490
How do you get one of them deals?

01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:08.090
Well, blowing boys in the head...

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.790
Whoa, whoa, whoa, son!

01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:11.990
I ain't saying shit about you.
I'm just talking.

01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:14.590
You don't know what you're
talking about, so shut the fuck up!

01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:16.590
All right, man. All right! It's all right!

01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:19.890
Hey, Herman. Come on, man.
He just got back. Shit.

01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:22.490
To get back
he had to have gone somewhere.

01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:24.190
- Fuck you!
- All right, man.

01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:28.890
- Come on, sit down.
- God damn it.

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:41.890
So what happened?

01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:48.390
They been keeping a folder on me
'cause of my stomach.

01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:52.590
Like how I used to get before games
back in school.

01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:56.490
I can't shoot.

01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:59.590
I mean, target practice, I'm a pro.

01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:02.190
I can tag
right between the numbers, but...

01:08:06.090 --> 01:08:09.790
Something happens
when I get around loud noises.

01:08:10.690 --> 01:08:14.490
I get shaky and start to lose my breath.

01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:18.890
They called it anxiety.

01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:21.090
Severe anxiety.

01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:26.090
Anyway, they sent me home.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:34.090
I guess it could be worse.
Could be coming back in a body bag.

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:37.090
Hey, I can't get Rae on the phone.

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:40.689
I mean, I called, she's not at home.

01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:42.590
None of her friends
seem to know where she is.

01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:43.689
She's around.

01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:44.890
Always is.

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:47.090
I don't know. I just feel like
something bad's happened.

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:49.990
You'd tell me
if you knew something, right?

01:08:57.290 --> 01:09:00.790
Now that's sharp. That is sharp.

01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:02.990
You ain't had no trouble with that chain,
did you?

01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:04.090
No.

01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:10.790
Well, steaks is on.

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:13.689
Potatoes is boiling.

01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:16.490
R.L. and Lincoln are out there
grilling the corn.

01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:19.290
I'm about to throw these biscuits
in the oven.

01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:22.590
- What you know how to fix?
- I don't fucking cook.

01:09:22.689 --> 01:09:26.790
You know, Rae, I known a whole bunch
of hard-cussing people in my day...

01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:30.490
All right, all right. Now, look.
I put the goddamn dress on, okay?

01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:33.090
I think I'm handling myself
with a little bit of fucking restraint,

01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:35.689
how you got me chained up here
like I'm some kind of dog!

01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:36.990
Rae. Rae!

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:39.990
I ain't arguing with you.

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:43.990
All I'm saying is
I know you got more in you than filth.

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:49.689
- You saying you can't cook nothing?
- No.

01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:55.890
- Can you boil water?
- I think I can handle that.

01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:58.790
All right. Get to handling it.

01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:09.090
- We gonna eat with her?
- That's what I'm told.

01:10:12.490 --> 01:10:16.190
- She still gonna have that chain on?
- Well, I'm working on that.

01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:20.490
We ask you to bless this meal
put before us.

01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:22.490
May this food nourish our bodies

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:24.690
and may the fellowship
nourish our spirit.

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:27.090
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:28.490
Amen.

01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:32.190
Y'all let me know
if these steaks is too dry, all right?

01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:35.390
And don't be shy now.
Got plenty over here.

01:10:35.490 --> 01:10:38.690
- This all looks wonderful.
- I skipped lunch today.

01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:45.790
These eggs got a little kick to them.
What you put in this?

01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:48.890
I expect you need to ask the chef here.

01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:50.490
Cayenne pepper.

01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:07.490
Rae?

01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:10.790
Rae?

01:11:24.090 --> 01:11:25.790
Kitchen looks just like I left it.

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:28.290
She ever tell you
she was thinking of taking off?

01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:31.190
You know how she gets!
With her history...

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:33.590
God damn!

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:40.590
I guess I could see
how she could get scared.

01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:48.390
All right. All right, man.

01:11:49.190 --> 01:11:50.490
Sit down.

01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:04.390
Her mamma works down
at the grocery down on the square.

01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:06.790
- Hell, maybe she's seen her.
- Ronnie.

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:09.490
You can't see it
'cause you're too close to it.

01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:13.990
Anxiety spells you get,
you never had that shit back in school.

01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:16.290
- That's not true...
- You joined up in that monkey troop

01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:18.390
'cause you had a plan for yourself!

01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:21.190
Army's gonna pay for school.
Gonna get yourself a degree.

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:23.190
Maybe something in business
or agriculture.

01:12:23.290 --> 01:12:24.790
You were gonna
make something of yourself.

01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:28.390
Then you had to go and fall in love
with the school slut.

01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:31.090
Hey, I know about how she was like.

01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:34.490
Hey, I was the only one
she talked to about it.

01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:36.290
How she was abused.

01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:39.990
- Terrible things, Gill.
- Bullshit.

01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:41.990
Terrible things. Things you
don't even wanna know about.

01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:43.590
You had a plan!

01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:46.990
You had a goddamn life
and she just fucked the guts out of you!

01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:49.490
She had to take care of me
the whole time!

01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:54.290
Shit, I'd start throwing up, choking!

01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:59.990
And I got better. You know?

01:13:01.690 --> 01:13:05.390
And since we been together
she put all that junk behind her.

01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:08.290
She been faithful.

01:13:21.290 --> 01:13:22.990
First weekend away,

01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:26.990
when you was off playing soldier
on Saturdays,

01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:30.590
I come over, drop off spare keys
like you want me to.

01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:33.990
You weren't gone two hours

01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:38.990
and she was aching
to get me inside of her.

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:43.490
I mean, every time you leave town,
that pussy's up for grabs.

01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:45.090
You're a liar.

01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:48.690
Is that right?

01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:53.690
Don't you think it's funny how I know
where everything in your house is?

01:13:57.190 --> 01:14:00.290
I don't care if that hurts you or not.
I really don't.

01:14:04.090 --> 01:14:05.190
Truth is

01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:09.890
I don't even know who you are anymore.

01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:14.390
So fuck it.

01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:59.390
- You gonna steal my truck now?
- Make yourself at home.

01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:01.990
You've done it already.

01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:20.490
- You take it straight?
- Sure.

01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:33.190
Jesus!

01:15:36.090 --> 01:15:38.190
- You want another one?
- Sure.

01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:41.390
We drinking buddies now?

01:15:45.090 --> 01:15:46.590
To

01:15:52.290 --> 01:15:53.490
freedom.

01:15:54.690 --> 01:15:56.390
Still making jokes.

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:01.990
This ain't no joke.

01:16:03.690 --> 01:16:05.090
Come here.

01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:14.790
It ain't on me to change your life
or nobody else's.

01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:20.990
Shit. People gonna do
what the hell they wanna do anyway.

01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:29.490
You ain't got but one life.

01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:33.190
You ought to live it the way you want.

01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:47.290
I can take you back to town now
if you want.

01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:52.390
Laz,

01:16:54.190 --> 01:16:56.390
will you do something for me?

01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:01.790
Whatever you want.

01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:37.490
I ain't played for nobody in years.

01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:49.090
I wanted me some kids,
a whole mess of them.

01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:54.590
But for Rose, my wife,
kids is for another time.

01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:01.390
Then one spring,

01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:06.290
I seened a change in her.

01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:09.690
Her breasts started swelling up.

01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:14.390
Couple of mornings,
I hear her in the bathroom throwing up.

01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:19.290
I done seen it in other women before,
so I knew.

01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:24.890
Then one day,

01:18:25.890 --> 01:18:29.390
Rose said she had to go to Jackson,
visit her folks,

01:18:29.490 --> 01:18:33.090
and she ain't wanted me to go,
so I stayed here.

01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:40.390
You know how they talk about a woman
having that glow?

01:18:43.190 --> 01:18:45.290
She didn't have it no more.

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:49.490
She done cut it out.

01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:52.290
Got rid of it.

01:18:58.290 --> 01:19:00.190
That voice in my head,

01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:05.390
every time I think it's gone,
it comes howling back.

01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:10.090
Calls me when I'm ailing,

01:19:10.890 --> 01:19:13.590
when I can't find my way home.

01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:15.990
Lost in the pines.

01:19:17.690 --> 01:19:20.290
I calls it the Black Snake Moan.

01:19:26.890 --> 01:19:30.890
Black snake all in my room

01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:46.690
Black snake all in my room

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:57.890
Some pretty mamma

01:19:58.190 --> 01:20:02.390
Better get this black snake soon

01:20:10.690 --> 01:20:13.490
Sing, Laz. Please keep singing.

01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:23.890
Black snake is evil

01:20:25.190 --> 01:20:28.990
Black snake is all I see

01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:38.890
Black snake is evil

01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:43.890
Black snake is all I see

01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:53.690
Woke up this morning

01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:59.590
Black snake moved in on me

01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:46.990
- Where you gonna be?
- I'm gonna be right here.

01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:48.890
- Be here all afternoon.
- Okay.

01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:54.690
Hey.

01:21:56.290 --> 01:21:58.390
You sure you ready for this?

01:22:00.190 --> 01:22:03.490
Yeah. Yeah, no big deal.
I'm just gonna get some girlie stuff.

01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:05.790
You know, like some makeup and stuff.

01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:08.690
All right.

01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:23.890
Hey.

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:27.090
You know,
this town ain't going nowhere.

01:22:27.190 --> 01:22:29.290
Take all the time you need.

01:22:29.890 --> 01:22:31.190
All right.

01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:54.590
She a friend of mine.

01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:15.590
I bet you got a lot of loyal customers.

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.590
- Hey, Miss Angie.
- Hey.

01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:20.290
Like what I brung you, huh?

01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:23.190
I've been eating like a princess all week.

01:23:24.190 --> 01:23:26.590
I even got enough for us to take lunch.

01:23:26.690 --> 01:23:28.090
That'd be nice.

01:23:28.190 --> 01:23:31.190
And I got that lotion on you gave me.

01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:34.590
Can you smell it?

01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:40.390
Now that's nice, too.

01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:01.590
Hey.

01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:05.590
What happened to your face?

01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:08.290
I got in a little accident.

01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:13.990
I was thinking,
since you're working on the square now,

01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:18.090
if you wanted to, we could get coffee
or something some morning.

01:24:18.190 --> 01:24:20.990
- You need money again?
- No.

01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:22.290
No, I...

01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:25.590
Why we always gotta do this?

01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:28.390
You and me been at each other
as far back as I can remember.

01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:29.990
I'm your daughter.

01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:35.190
- I'm the only family you got.
- You never needed nobody, Rae.

01:24:35.290 --> 01:24:37.390
You always made that
perfectly clear to me.

01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:38.890
I know I did.

01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:44.490
But I'm trying to be different, you know.
I'm trying to get some peace.

01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:49.390
Yeah, well, I'm working here now.
Can't you see that?

01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:55.390
I just wanted some makeup.

01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:57.490
All that shit's on aisle five.

01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:08.490
I just think you should've
kept him off me, that's all.

01:25:15.690 --> 01:25:19.390
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Now don't do that, Mamma.

01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:22.090
I will go along
with all the crap you talk about me,

01:25:22.190 --> 01:25:24.390
but you can't pretend no more on that.

01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:25.990
'Cause I was just a kid.

01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:28.490
I didn't know
about all that shit he was doing to me.

01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:30.490
And you let him do it.

01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:33.790
Some big nobody in your life and you
let him do whatever the fuck he wanted!

01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:37.190
No. Okay. All right. I'm sorry, Mamma.
I didn't mean to shout.

01:25:37.290 --> 01:25:38.790
Sorry, I didn't mean to get upset.
I just...

01:25:38.890 --> 01:25:40.690
All my life I've been
putting out your fires

01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:43.590
while you been giving out your snatch
to every wagging dick in this town!

01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:44.890
And now you're gonna
put the blame at my feet?

01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:46.090
Mamma, if we can just talk about it.

01:25:46.190 --> 01:25:47.790
If you could just tell me,
we could be eye to eye on this.

01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:49.090
I'm just not gonna take your shit.
No, I'm not.

01:25:49.190 --> 01:25:52.390
You don't have to say you're sorry!
Just tell me how you knew!

01:25:52.490 --> 01:25:54.590
The only thing I'm sorry for

01:25:54.690 --> 01:25:57.090
is for ever listening to my parents
and having you

01:25:57.190 --> 01:25:59.390
and not doing what I should've done.

01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:13.590
Tell me you didn't know,
you goddamn liar! Tell me!

01:26:14.290 --> 01:26:16.990
You fucking liar!

01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:18.590
Fuck you!

01:26:18.690 --> 01:26:22.290
You were in the next goddamn room,
you bitch!

01:26:24.090 --> 01:26:27.090
What you be doing with yourself
when you ain't working?

01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:31.090
I was thinking about singing in the choir.

01:26:31.190 --> 01:26:32.690
Up at the church?

01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:35.890
- Why don't you sing me something?
- When? Now?

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:37.090
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

01:26:37.190 --> 01:26:41.390
Come on now, don't be shy.
Just go ahead and let it out.

01:26:44.890 --> 01:26:46.590
All right. Let's see.

01:26:49.090 --> 01:26:55.290
There is a balm in Gilead

01:26:56.990 --> 01:27:02.190
To make the wounded whole

01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:09.890
There is a balm in Gilead

01:27:10.890 --> 01:27:15.990
To heal the sin sick soul

01:27:16.890 --> 01:27:19.190
What? What is it?

01:27:21.190 --> 01:27:22.490
Get off!

01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:25.390
My God!

01:27:27.690 --> 01:27:30.490
Turn her loose!
Turn her loose, God damn it!

01:27:36.190 --> 01:27:38.290
Do you hear the sound of my voice?

01:27:43.190 --> 01:27:45.590
Y'all get on out the way now.
Move, man!

01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:51.790
This your niece?

01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:26.390
You took care of your wife
like you do me?

01:28:29.090 --> 01:28:30.190
I tried.

01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:29.690
Ain't no use in us fighting this shit.

01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:31.990
You and me, we night owls.

01:29:33.090 --> 01:29:34.390
Get dressed.

01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:54.490
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:04.490
All right, see if you can find yourself
a seat over there

01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:06.590
in the corner on that bench.

01:30:06.690 --> 01:30:09.190
Go on.
Ain't nobody gonna fuck with you.

01:30:10.090 --> 01:30:11.490
Who the hell's all this?

01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:14.890
What? I called Bojo, like you said.
Called the fellas in the band.

01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:16.590
Where the fuck
all these people come from?

01:30:16.690 --> 01:30:18.390
I been drinking
in this shithole all my life,

01:30:18.490 --> 01:30:20.590
I ain't never seen
this many people in here at once.

01:30:20.690 --> 01:30:22.590
Shithole? Kiss my ass, Laz.

01:30:22.690 --> 01:30:24.090
Back at you, motherfucker.

01:30:24.190 --> 01:30:27.390
I bet both of y'all called all these people,
didn't you?

01:30:27.490 --> 01:30:30.890
That's right, preacher, get me drunk
so I don't stick my foot up your ass.

01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:32.990
I just know how you get.

01:30:33.090 --> 01:30:36.190
Good to know
you still got some butterflies in your gut.

01:30:37.290 --> 01:30:39.090
All right, here we go.

01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:41.290
Hey, y'all.

01:30:42.190 --> 01:30:43.190
All right.

01:30:51.790 --> 01:30:55.290
Ced. Ken. Thank y'all for coming.

01:30:57.090 --> 01:30:59.590
All y'all, hush up. Shut up.

01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:03.990
All right now.
Y'all ready for some shit?

01:31:05.290 --> 01:31:07.290
Is you ready for some shit?

01:31:09.290 --> 01:31:10.590
Alice Mae.

01:31:20.190 --> 01:31:22.990
If you see my baby

01:31:23.090 --> 01:31:26.290
They call her Alice Mae

01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:28.490
Yeah! You home now, old man!

01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:30.890
You just walked through the door!
Yeah!

01:31:30.990 --> 01:31:33.590
If you see my baby

01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:37.290
They call her Alice Mae

01:31:37.390 --> 01:31:39.190
You wanna cut it up, baby?

01:31:42.090 --> 01:31:44.690
Tell all them fellas

01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:47.790
They'd better stay away

01:31:52.190 --> 01:31:54.790
Tell all them fellas

01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:58.090
In this here neighborhood

01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:05.290
Tell all them fellas

01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:08.590
In this here neighborhood

01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:15.890
This here's my woman

01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:21.090
That chacha will do you no good

01:32:30.090 --> 01:32:32.490
Whoa! Yeah!

01:32:44.690 --> 01:32:48.290
This here a song from back in the day

01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:51.390
Nineteen hundred and sixty-two

01:32:53.090 --> 01:32:56.590
My woman put my black ass
out in the cold

01:32:56.690 --> 01:32:58.690
I said, "Baby, why you leaving?"

01:32:58.790 --> 01:33:01.190
She said, "Our love done gone cold"

01:33:01.290 --> 01:33:05.390
Well, I waded through water
and I waded through mud

01:33:05.490 --> 01:33:09.890
Till I come to this place
they call the Bucket of Blood

01:33:19.690 --> 01:33:22.790
You know, that bartender
give me a dirty look and a dirty glass

01:33:22.890 --> 01:33:27.190
I said, "Say, motherfucker!
Do you know who I am?"

01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:31.690
He said, "Hell no, nigger!
I don't give a goddamn!"

01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:45.190
I reached down in my pocket
and pulled out my shiny.44

01:33:45.290 --> 01:33:47.390
Shot that motherfucker twice!

01:33:47.490 --> 01:33:49.090
He hit the goddamn floor

01:33:54.190 --> 01:33:57.890
'Bout that time
you could've heard the drop of a pin

01:33:57.990 --> 01:34:02.390
That's when that bad motherfucker
Billy Lyons walked in

01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:15.790
'Bout that time a pimp eased up
and turned out the lights

01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:19.590
That's when I had old Billy Lyons
dead in my sights

01:34:19.690 --> 01:34:23.290
When the lights come back on
old Billy gone to rest

01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:27.690
I pumped nine of my bullets
in his motherfucking chest!

01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:08.990
Sometime, that kind of blues

01:35:09.690 --> 01:35:13.590
will make you even kill one another

01:35:13.690 --> 01:35:17.190
or do anything that kind of low.

01:35:17.890 --> 01:35:21.090
It goes here, on this side.

01:35:22.690 --> 01:35:24.490
That's where the blues started.

01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:26.890
It ain't on this side. It's over here.

01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:34.790
This little light of mine

01:35:34.890 --> 01:35:38.190
I'm gonna let it shine

01:35:38.290 --> 01:35:41.190
This little light of mine

01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:46.590
This little light of mine

01:35:50.490 --> 01:35:53.590
This little light of mine

01:35:53.690 --> 01:35:56.690
I'm gonna let it shine

01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:59.190
This little light of...

01:36:00.490 --> 01:36:01.890
This little light of mine

01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:04.090
Look like somebody know a song.

01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:09.090
No. I got the words in my head
but, you know...

01:36:09.190 --> 01:36:12.090
I don't know where I learned it.
But I can't play.

01:36:13.090 --> 01:36:14.690
How you feeling?

01:36:16.190 --> 01:36:19.190
You know how you feel
when you come out of a bad hangover?

01:36:19.290 --> 01:36:21.990
You know, like you could
open your eyes a little more?

01:36:22.090 --> 01:36:24.190
Yeah. Yeah, I'm there.

01:36:25.390 --> 01:36:28.690
I got up real early this morning.
You know, the sun was shining.

01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:31.590
And I thought
maybe I'd see if I could play this, but...

01:36:31.690 --> 01:36:33.690
- You can.
- No, I can't.

01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:36.290
Yeah, you can.
Right here. Right here, see?

01:36:38.890 --> 01:36:42.190
- I tell you what. You sing.
- All right.

01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:45.190
- I'll see if I can pick it out for you.
- Okay.

01:36:47.190 --> 01:36:48.690
All right, now.

01:36:49.290 --> 01:36:54.790
Just close your eyes
and think on what you love.

01:36:56.590 --> 01:36:59.390
- Get a real good picture of it.
- What I love.

01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:07.190
This little light of mine

01:37:07.290 --> 01:37:10.490
I'm gonna let it shine

01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:13.590
This little light of mine

01:37:13.690 --> 01:37:16.790
I'm gonna let it shine

01:37:16.890 --> 01:37:19.890
This little light of mine

01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:22.190
I'm gonna let it shine

01:37:22.290 --> 01:37:27.990
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

01:37:29.290 --> 01:37:31.390
Hide it under a bushel

01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:35.190
No, I'm gonna let it shine

01:37:35.290 --> 01:37:37.390
Hide it under a bushel

01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:41.490
No, I'm gonna let it shine

01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:43.690
Hide it under a bushel

01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:46.590
No, I'm gonna let it shine

01:37:46.690 --> 01:37:52.590
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

01:37:53.890 --> 01:37:56.490
This little light of mine

01:37:56.690 --> 01:37:59.590
I'm gonna let it shine

01:37:59.690 --> 01:38:02.590
This little light of mine

01:38:02.690 --> 01:38:05.690
I'm gonna let it shine

01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:08.890
This little light of mine

01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:11.390
I'm gonna let it shine

01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:16.490
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

01:38:18.290 --> 01:38:19.490
Ronnie!

01:38:20.090 --> 01:38:21.190
No!

01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:27.590
It ain't been but a week
and you already some nigger's whore.

01:38:29.290 --> 01:38:31.690
Oh, did you think I wouldn't find out?

01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:35.390
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

01:38:35.490 --> 01:38:39.890
Gill told me how you and him...
How you and everybody...

01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:42.090
Did you have fun with her, huh?

01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:45.590
Sweet as a peach, I bet! Huh?

01:38:45.690 --> 01:38:47.990
- No!
- Shut up, bitch! Shut the fuck up!

01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:50.790
Be careful where you aim that gun, boy.

01:38:52.090 --> 01:38:54.590
Or what? Huh?

01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:56.790
Or what?

01:38:56.890 --> 01:38:59.190
You come to talk, boy,
or you come to kill somebody?

01:38:59.290 --> 01:39:02.090
You ain't gonna be calling me boy
when I blow your fucking face off!

01:39:02.190 --> 01:39:06.590
Boy, you so green
you couldn't stomp a baby duck.

01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:09.490
Are you testing me? Huh?

01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:12.090
Just what kind of test
would that be, huh?

01:39:13.090 --> 01:39:14.690
Test if you're a man?

01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:17.290
If you're a killer?

01:39:18.190 --> 01:39:20.690
Hell, that ain't hard to find out, is it?

01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:23.490
All you gotta do is pull that trigger back.

01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:25.290
Go on.

01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:27.290
Go ahead.

01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:32.690
- Okay, Ronnie...
- God damn it, Rae!

01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:35.190
Keep that gun trained on me, boy.

01:39:35.290 --> 01:39:38.590
Now, you wanna kill a man,
and all you need's a reason, right?

01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:41.190
Well, you know
she been out here with me.

01:39:42.590 --> 01:39:46.590
Been all over town giving up that switch
you thought was yours.

01:39:46.690 --> 01:39:49.890
- Shut up!
- Give all your love to one woman

01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:52.390
and she give it to another man.

01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:55.090
Now that's a reason to kill a man there.

01:39:55.190 --> 01:39:58.890
Then won't be no questions.
She'll know you a man!

01:39:58.990 --> 01:40:01.190
- A real killer!
- Don't say that to me!

01:40:01.290 --> 01:40:03.990
I'm too old to play house or cowboys.

01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:08.590
You gonna do it or get out of my face.

01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:12.190
Go on.

01:40:13.090 --> 01:40:14.190
Do it!

01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:17.190
Ronnie. Ronnie.

01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:22.790
Ronnie, baby, look at me.
Ronnie, look at me. Look at me.

01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:24.390
Come on, look at me.

01:40:24.490 --> 01:40:28.590
Baby, it's all right. I got you. I got you.

01:40:28.690 --> 01:40:31.690
Come on. Come on.

01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:38.590
Hold on. Hold on, baby.

01:40:40.590 --> 01:40:42.290
- Hey, it's me.
- It's okay.

01:40:42.490 --> 01:40:44.590
I need you to get over here.

01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:46.890
Yeah, right now!

01:40:57.490 --> 01:41:00.090
We did a lot of dreaming, me and Rae.

01:41:02.490 --> 01:41:04.490
Made big plans to get out.

01:41:09.690 --> 01:41:13.690
I'd go do my tour and move out of here.

01:41:16.690 --> 01:41:18.490
Maybe go to Knoxville.

01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:29.390
But when Rae

01:41:30.290 --> 01:41:32.390
gets like she does

01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:36.690
and does the things

01:41:38.590 --> 01:41:40.190
that she does...

01:41:45.090 --> 01:41:47.090
Go on, Ronnie. Go on.

01:41:47.190 --> 01:41:50.990
- This is fucking stupid.
- Go on.

01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:55.490
What Rae did for me,

01:41:59.790 --> 01:42:01.290
she fixed me.

01:42:08.090 --> 01:42:09.790
But I can't fix her.

01:42:14.490 --> 01:42:15.490
Rae,

01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:20.190
we don't wanna fix you or judge you.

01:42:21.490 --> 01:42:23.790
Only you and the good Lord can do that.

01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:27.990
But I want you to tell me
about these spells you get.

01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:33.990
Well,

01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:38.890
I get these thoughts in my head,
you know.

01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:44.990
Like shit I done
or shit that's been done to me,

01:42:45.090 --> 01:42:47.690
and I can't get them out.

01:42:48.290 --> 01:42:51.090
And it burns, you know, it hurts.

01:42:51.190 --> 01:42:55.090
It starts in my head
and moves down to my hands,

01:42:55.190 --> 01:42:59.290
and my stomach, and then lower, and...

01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:06.890
You know, sometimes I can stop them
but mostly I can't.

01:43:07.890 --> 01:43:10.090
The only thing that ever
made that feel better was Ronnie

01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:11.890
'cause I love him so much.

01:43:13.690 --> 01:43:17.790
Why don't you look at Ronnie
and tell him how you feel?

01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:36.190
I think... I think we're fucked up.

01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:40.090
Both of us. I mean, I know I am.

01:43:42.490 --> 01:43:46.290
But that don't mean
that what I feel isn't real,

01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:48.890
that I can't love somebody.

01:43:51.190 --> 01:43:56.890
And I know how I've been
and what I've done is real, real bad.

01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:59.190
But...

01:44:08.490 --> 01:44:11.190
So if you wanna quit on me,
I understand.

01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:14.390
But please don't.

01:44:18.690 --> 01:44:19.790
So,

01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:24.190
what you two gonna do about this?

01:44:40.190 --> 01:44:41.790
Hi, Miss Angie.

01:44:41.890 --> 01:44:46.390
You wasn't at your work
so I just figured I'd drop by.

01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:47.990
What you need?

01:44:49.290 --> 01:44:51.090
I need your help again.

01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:53.490
More cough syrup?

01:44:55.590 --> 01:44:56.890
Come on.

01:45:01.890 --> 01:45:03.090
Shit.

01:45:05.290 --> 01:45:06.690
You Ronnie?

01:45:08.590 --> 01:45:09.590
Yeah.

01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:12.390
I'm Lincoln.
I'm gonna be your best man.

01:45:13.590 --> 01:45:14.590
Okay.

01:45:15.190 --> 01:45:18.590
You having trouble with that tie?
'Cause I'm pretty good at it.

01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:28.590
Gotta do it like this
or I'll get all turned around.

01:45:33.790 --> 01:45:36.590
Laz, she's ready.

01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:43.990
Ain't she pretty?

01:45:44.590 --> 01:45:46.990
I'll give y'all some time together.

01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:55.390
Now that is sharp!

01:45:56.090 --> 01:45:58.590
Girl, you sharp as a tack.

01:45:58.690 --> 01:46:00.690
Old Miss Ella Mae done you right,
didn't she?

01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:02.490
- Yeah.
- You like it?

01:46:02.590 --> 01:46:04.090
I've had nice things before

01:46:04.190 --> 01:46:06.390
but, you know,
I always seem to ruin them somehow.

01:46:06.490 --> 01:46:09.990
This here one yours.
I know you gonna take care of it.

01:46:10.090 --> 01:46:13.590
- I'm gonna try. But, Laz...
- Hey, hey.

01:46:13.690 --> 01:46:17.290
We ain't gonna have
no talk like that today, all right?

01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:21.290
You and me, we gonna get through this.
We gonna be just fine.

01:46:22.590 --> 01:46:25.090
You go on and live your life.

01:46:25.190 --> 01:46:28.890
Get your shit together and live your life.

01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.990
Okay.

01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:39.390
I don't want you to let go of me.

01:46:40.590 --> 01:46:41.890
You and me,

01:46:43.390 --> 01:46:45.790
we always gonna have hope
to each other.

01:46:53.090 --> 01:46:57.490
When I was a child, I talked like a child,

01:46:57.690 --> 01:47:02.290
I thought like a child,
I reasoned like a child.

01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:08.190
When I became a man,
I put aside my childish ways.

01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:11.990
All right. You got her now.

01:47:13.790 --> 01:47:15.890
And now these three remain,

01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:22.390
faith, hope and love.

01:47:22.890 --> 01:47:25.890
But the greatest of these is love.

01:48:49.890 --> 01:48:51.090
Ronnie?

01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:54.090
I gotta pull over.

01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:36.090
Okay.

01:49:37.590 --> 01:49:38.590
Okay.

01:49:39.890 --> 01:49:40.890
Okay.

01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:45.190
This little light of mine

01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:48.190
I'm gonna let it shine

01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:50.790
This little light of mine

01:49:50.890 --> 01:49:53.190
I'm gonna let it shine

01:49:53.290 --> 01:49:56.090
This little light of mine

01:49:56.190 --> 01:49:59.190
I'm gonna let it shine

01:49:59.290 --> 01:50:03.690
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

01:50:08.190 --> 01:50:09.490
Baby.

01:50:11.590 --> 01:50:12.590
See?

01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:14.890
See? We're okay.

01:50:15.590 --> 01:50:16.990
We're okay.
