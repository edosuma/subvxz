10:32.099 --> 10:34.134
Who may have left
a fingerprint,

10:34.267 --> 10:36.904
a clue that could lead you
to her identity.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.572
In the world I'm living in,
nothing is more important.

10:39.707 --> 10:42.442
I'll see
what can I do.

10:42.575 --> 10:47.114
"Under the greenwood tree,
who loves to lie with me,

10:47.247 --> 10:52.485
"and turn his merry note
unto the sweet bird's throat."

10:53.553 --> 10:54.788
Nice rhyme.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.089
Shakespeare thought so.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.759
Okay.

11:02.730 --> 11:05.098
♪**♪

11:11.204 --> 11:12.706
You said the robber
had staked out the bank,

11:12.840 --> 11:15.608
so I pulled a list of people
with safety deposit boxes.

11:15.743 --> 11:16.910
Thought I'd catch Park
up to speed

11:17.044 --> 11:18.645
on The Freelancer's
handiwork.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.014
Collapsed buildings,
overturned ferries,
all to kill one person?

11:21.148 --> 11:22.615
Yeah,
he was a real peach,

11:22.750 --> 11:24.517
who may walk free unless
Liz shows up in court.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.519
We have to find her.

11:26.653 --> 11:29.322
The only way to do that
is to find the thief
on this list.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.891
Well, we better hope
that Cooper

11:31.024 --> 11:33.093
can stall the judge
until we do.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.627
To be clear, Mr. Rovenpor,

11:34.762 --> 11:37.164
your client pleaded guilty
to one count of murder,

11:37.297 --> 11:41.168
namely the murder of a woman
named Floriana Campo.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.336
A notorious human trafficker,
Your Honor.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.872
At the time,
Mr. Veseli's attorney

11:45.005 --> 11:47.307
moved that the government
be ordered to disclose

11:47.440 --> 11:49.777
the identity of
the confidential informant

11:49.910 --> 11:52.512
who supplied most
of the information
that led to his arrest.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.882
A motion I denied.
Yes, Your Honor,

11:55.015 --> 11:57.050
and in light of your ruling,
and only because of it,

11:57.184 --> 11:59.652
my client felt that it
was in his best interest
to enter a plea.

11:59.787 --> 12:02.222
Many cases are founded
on intel supplied

12:02.355 --> 12:04.324
by confidential sources,
Your Honor.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.193
You weighed the variables
at the time

12:06.326 --> 12:07.861
and made a perfectly
reasonable ruling.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.930
I agree.
You agree?

12:10.063 --> 12:13.133
It was reasonable
based on the information...

12:13.266 --> 12:14.667
You made available
at the time,

12:14.802 --> 12:16.770
but since that time,
new information
has come to light.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.372
For starters, we now know
that Agent Elizabeth Keen

12:19.506 --> 12:21.208
has made a number
of high-profile cases

12:21.341 --> 12:23.043
based on intel
from confidential sources.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.744
A shocking number.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.815
More, in fact, than any
other major case agent.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.682
We'd have to review
those numbers.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.519
The vast majority,
if not all,
of those cases

12:32.652 --> 12:35.355
were based on intel
supplied by the same
individual.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.290
You believe that
based on what?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.226
I've read
the defendant's papers.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.728
All these cases...
Ms. Navarro,
can you assure me

12:41.862 --> 12:43.196
there were
multiple sources?

12:43.330 --> 12:44.731
We are not able
to answer that.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.066
Because if she did,

12:46.199 --> 12:47.801
you'd wonder if there was
any informant at all,

12:47.935 --> 12:50.370
since one person
couldn't possibly have

12:50.503 --> 12:53.406
such a wide variety
of criminal knowledge.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.944
Maybe Agent Keen fabricated
her quote-unquote "source"

12:57.077 --> 12:59.546
as a way to get defendants
to cop a plea.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.381
There has been
no fabrication,
Your Honor,

13:01.514 --> 13:03.083
and there is no evidence
to show that there has been.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.218
Not yet, but that's why
you're here,

13:05.352 --> 13:07.087
because I'm not prepared
to take your word on that.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.256
I want to hear
from Agent Keen.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.325
Your Honor, I am
Assistant Director
Harold Cooper of the FBI.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.862
I'm Agent Keen's
immediate supervisor.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.763
Unfortunately,
she's on assignment

13:16.897 --> 13:18.265
and unable
to be here today.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.233
Her assignment
was to show up
in my courtroom.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.734
I'm afraid that
won't be possible.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.071
How convenient.
Your Honor,
this is intentional.

13:24.204 --> 13:28.375
Until when? How long before
she can answer my questions,
in person and under oath?

13:28.508 --> 13:29.943
I honestly don't know,
Your Honor.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.079
Well, that's not
gonna cut it,
Mr. Cooper.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.114
Have Keen here
by 4:00 p.m. today.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.582
I can't guarantee that,
Your Honor.

13:35.715 --> 13:36.649
I can guarantee this.

13:36.783 --> 13:37.951
If she's not here,

13:38.085 --> 13:39.419
I will grant
the defendant's motion

13:39.552 --> 13:42.322
and Mr. Veseli
may very well be released.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.258
♪**♪

13:49.296 --> 13:50.297
He's here.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.499
Ah.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.872
Red, you should know,
Keen approached me
last week.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.307
She said you were dying.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.776
That she's the heir apparent

14:03.911 --> 14:05.612
and I should
throw in with her.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.080
Did you find anything?

14:07.214 --> 14:08.481
No prints or DNA.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.985
But you said the note
was left by a bank robber,

14:12.119 --> 14:14.121
so I checked it
against a database

14:14.254 --> 14:18.258
of information on robberies,
other notes, documents,

14:18.391 --> 14:22.695
and found a handwriting match
to a previous robbery.

14:22.829 --> 14:26.900
Thank you, Cvetko,
for your work
and your loyalty.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.605
The Bell Tower heist
in '94?

14:32.739 --> 14:33.941
You know it?

14:34.074 --> 14:36.309
I do,
and the man who did it.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.713
Three pills,
half a glass of water.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.515
Nothing else
until I come back.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.122
She's rather
charmless.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.926
We both know
you didn't come here

14:53.060 --> 14:54.894
for a skip
down memory lane.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.532
Two nights ago,
I was robbed.

14:59.666 --> 15:00.900
Thief left a note.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.636
The writing matches a note
you gave a teller

15:03.770 --> 15:06.239
during the Bell Tower job.

15:06.373 --> 15:09.042
You think I robbed you?

15:09.176 --> 15:12.345
I take two steps,
I gotta rest for an hour.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.847
I can't even steal my wallet
out of my own pocket.

15:17.817 --> 15:18.851
Sorry.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.089
Anything?

15:22.222 --> 15:24.624
We went through
the names of everyone
with a safe deposit box.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.094
Two weeks ago,
Terese Krissoff
opened one.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.929
Only the real Ms. Krissoff
died three months ago.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.298
The impostor
opened an account

15:31.431 --> 15:32.932
with a fake
Social Security number

15:33.066 --> 15:34.367
so she can
case the room.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.169
The robbers
avoided surveillance

15:36.303 --> 15:37.470
when they broke into
your box.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.106
<i>But we pulled a photo</i>
<i>of Krissoff</i>

15:39.239 --> 15:40.873
from a week ago
when she was prepping the job.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.575
We just sent you
a copy of the image.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.212
<i>We can't make</i>
<i>a positive ID. Can you?</i>

15:49.016 --> 15:51.084
No, but I may know
someone who can.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.890
I was once held captive
by the Shining Path.

15:58.025 --> 16:01.928
Three months of unrelenting
heat and humidity

16:02.062 --> 16:04.297
in the Peruvian jungle,

16:04.431 --> 16:07.300
mixed with the occasional
round of electroshock.

16:07.434 --> 16:10.403
All in all, it was a rather
unpleasant experience

16:10.537 --> 16:12.205
but for my cellmate,

16:12.339 --> 16:16.743
a delightfully monkish,
bookish Polish aid worker

16:16.876 --> 16:19.012
who was also,
inexplicably,

16:19.146 --> 16:21.614
something of
a handwriting expert.

16:21.748 --> 16:26.253
While fending off
the daily onslaught
of rhinoceros beetles,

16:26.386 --> 16:30.057
he would hold forth
on why a child's handwriting

16:30.190 --> 16:33.826
is often nearly identical
to that of at least one,

16:33.960 --> 16:39.466
if not a little of both,
of his or her parents'
handwriting.

16:39.599 --> 16:43.370
Apparently, the similarity
isn't genetic at all,

16:43.503 --> 16:46.639
just subconscious
imitation.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.512
I didn't know
you had a daughter.

16:54.214 --> 16:57.450
I did once.
But not anymore.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.055
I owe you an apology.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.124
It's not your handwriting
on the note.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.259
It's hers.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.795
You didn't rob me. She did.

17:08.928 --> 17:13.032
No. That's impossible.
I need you to tell me
where she is.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.471
Where is she?

17:19.672 --> 17:23.876
Jennifer and I
are estranged.

17:24.010 --> 17:27.580
Now, I-I got those photos
from her mother.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.483
She and I agreed that Jen
should live with her

17:30.617 --> 17:34.287
s-so she could have a life,
a good life.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.723
An honest life.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.492
Where is she, Abe?

17:41.194 --> 17:43.396
I'm not gonna
ask you again.

17:43.530 --> 17:47.200
I can't tell you
because I don't know.

17:48.668 --> 17:53.406
But if you're right
that my baby's a thief,
go ahead.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.675
You may as well
kill me now,

17:55.808 --> 17:58.211
'cause I ain't got nothing
to live for.

18:05.518 --> 18:06.853
The photo Aram sent you...

18:06.986 --> 18:09.055
Were you able to ID
the woman in it?

18:09.189 --> 18:10.890
Yes. The lead bore fruit.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.325
So you know who robbed you,

18:12.459 --> 18:13.893
who Elizabeth hired
to rob you.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.229
I do. We're looking
for her now.

18:16.363 --> 18:17.364
We need to look together.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.931
After all these years,
Harold,

18:19.065 --> 18:21.434
I would think you'd know
I don't do halfsies.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.736
If we don't find Elizabeth
by 4:00 p.m. today,

18:23.870 --> 18:26.606
the case we made against
Alban Veseli will fall apart.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.741
Alban.
The Freelancer.
<i>Yes.</i>

18:28.875 --> 18:29.942
And he has a new attorney

18:30.076 --> 18:31.878
who claims we violated
his civil rights

18:32.011 --> 18:34.247
by not disclosing
that you were our source.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.616
<i>If Elizabeth doesn't appear</i>
<i>in court to defend the case,</i>

18:36.749 --> 18:38.518
<i>the judge</i>
<i>may let him walk.</i>

18:38.651 --> 18:40.787
So are we doing
halfsies or what?

18:43.490 --> 18:44.757
The woman
we're looking for,

18:44.891 --> 18:46.959
her name is
Jennifer Anne Moores.

18:47.093 --> 18:49.596
According to Reddington,
she's the daughter
of Abraham Moores.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.964
Reddington claims Moores
is a retired bank robber.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.966
Like father
like daughter.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.603
Moores was arrested in '98,
did nine years and retired.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.239
Or maybe passed on
the family business
to his daughter.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.107
Reddington
doesn't think so.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.809
He says the last thing
the father wanted

19:02.942 --> 19:04.644
was for his daughter
to follow in his footsteps.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.913
He told her that.
They became estranged.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.981
Reddington doesn't think he
knows where the daughter is.

19:09.115 --> 19:12.885
The DMV database shows
637 Jennifer Anne Moores.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.755
But once I cross-check that

19:15.888 --> 19:17.857
against the photo
we got from the bank...

19:17.990 --> 19:19.992
We got her address.

19:20.126 --> 19:22.462
And her occupation...
Well, alleged occupation

19:22.595 --> 19:25.632
since I doubt she's gonna list
"bank robber" on her
mortgage application.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.133
I want teams
at her home and work.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.001
Should we bring her in?
No, I want her followed.

19:29.135 --> 19:31.037
Hopefully to Elizabeth Keen.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.015
Aram, what's up
with your audio?
I don't know.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.752
I'm getting some nasty
frequency interference.
Hang on.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.556
That's the second call
she's had in five minutes.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.358
What's she up to?

19:51.491 --> 19:54.193
The whole thing's sort of
a double-edged sword,
isn't it?

19:54.327 --> 19:55.428
What whole thing?

19:55.562 --> 19:57.029
This business with Keen.

19:57.163 --> 19:58.765
And The Freelancer.
Him getting out.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.268
The guy derailed a train,
killed 60 innocents

20:01.401 --> 20:02.969
in an attempt
to hide one murder.
He's not getting out.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.070
He may if Keen doesn't show.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.572
He could walk.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.407
On the other hand,
if she does show,

20:07.540 --> 20:10.710
the killer stays in prison,
but we're forced
to arrest Keen.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.211
Double-edged sword.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.381
Well, at this point,
all we have are bad options,

20:14.514 --> 20:17.417
so arresting her may be
the best bad one we've got.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.851
<i>We haven't</i>
<i>been able to yet.</i>

20:18.985 --> 20:20.152
Yeah, but with the way
things are going,

20:20.287 --> 20:22.989
that might be the only way
to keep her safe.

20:23.122 --> 20:24.857
Now, who's this here?

20:24.991 --> 20:26.526
Think he's part
of her crew?

20:26.659 --> 20:28.194
Aram, where's that audio?

20:28.328 --> 20:30.229
Nasty frequency interference.
Hang on.

♪**♪

20:33.566 --> 20:35.001
Oop. Hang on.

30:49.615 --> 30:51.683
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:51.817 --> 30:53.285
How can I be a co-conspirator
if I don't know the woman?

30:53.419 --> 30:55.021
She sure knows you.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.956
At least, she seemed to when
we recorded the three of you

30:57.089 --> 30:58.290
meeting at True Cafe.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.492
I'm done talking.

31:00.626 --> 31:01.961
Raf's not.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.562
Raf's got plenty to say.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.830
About you.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.432
Jennifer.

31:06.565 --> 31:07.633
How you met
through her father.

31:07.766 --> 31:08.800
That's a lie.

31:08.935 --> 31:10.302
No, it's the truth.

31:10.436 --> 31:11.837
Silvina spent every day
with him.

31:11.971 --> 31:13.205
She's his live-in nurse.

31:13.339 --> 31:14.373
How could they not
know each other?

31:14.506 --> 31:15.574
Did Silvina say that?

31:15.707 --> 31:17.143
You leave
my father out of this.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.511
Your father
is a legendary thief
and a safe-cracker,

31:19.645 --> 31:22.014
and you don't expect us
to overlook that, did you?

31:22.148 --> 31:24.016
He went to prison
when I was seven.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.817
Okay. Enough already.

31:25.952 --> 31:27.319
She's your daughter.

31:27.453 --> 31:29.321
I never wanted
this life for her.

31:29.455 --> 31:31.690
She's the first thing
you think of every morning.

31:31.823 --> 31:34.426
Which is why
I thought it best
to stay away from her,

31:34.560 --> 31:36.228
even after
I got out of prison.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.230
I cut ties.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.832
You can't imagine
how hard that is.

31:40.967 --> 31:42.301
For the purposes
of this conversation,

31:42.434 --> 31:44.170
let's assume I can.

31:44.303 --> 31:46.705
I hated the man.
He walked out of my life.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.040
He abandoned me.

31:48.174 --> 31:50.542
Until one day,
I walked back in.

31:50.676 --> 31:54.680
Not to be with her,
you know, not to talk.

31:54.813 --> 31:56.148
Just...

31:56.282 --> 31:57.883
Just to see her.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.685
And what did you see?

31:59.818 --> 32:02.921
I saw my kid crack
the Vaultsafe 200

32:03.055 --> 32:07.526
of a two-bit meth dealer
in under four minutes.

32:07.659 --> 32:11.063
She was unrefined,
a little rushed, but...

32:11.197 --> 32:13.165
God, she had the touch.

32:13.299 --> 32:16.702
Even if I knew
where he was,
I wouldn't talk.

32:16.835 --> 32:18.570
He's an old man.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.473
I should have
called the police
right then and there.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.275
But she was your child.

32:23.409 --> 32:25.544
I figured I had something
to teach her.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.213
To share with her.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.547
A reason
to be in her life.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.950
Is that what he told you?
Well, he's lying.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.553
I think
he's still very much
involved in your life.

32:34.686 --> 32:37.889
In fact, Raf says he's the one
who selects the targets.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.391
<i>Of course I did.</i>

32:39.525 --> 32:42.128
She needed marks who
wouldn't report the crime,

32:42.261 --> 32:43.595
and I knew
where to find them.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.397
You certainly found me.

32:45.531 --> 32:48.800
Now, wait... I told her
that you were off-limits.

32:49.401 --> 32:50.736
I did, Raymond.

32:50.869 --> 32:52.671
But she wouldn't listen
because of the money.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.073
It was a lot of money.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.607
The job was a contract.

32:55.741 --> 32:56.875
Yes. A woman.

32:57.009 --> 32:59.111
Uh, some American.

32:59.245 --> 33:00.212
Tell me about her.

33:00.346 --> 33:01.913
Only
on one condition.

33:02.048 --> 33:03.782
You leave my father
out of this.

33:03.915 --> 33:05.184
Tell me about the woman.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.618
They met through
an acquaintance.

33:06.752 --> 33:09.255
Jennifer said she was
laying low after a job.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.956
Cape Town. Didn't have
anywhere to go.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.991
But Jen found
this safe house.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.660
Part of a network.

33:14.793 --> 33:17.629
Sanctuaries for criminals
on every continent.

33:17.763 --> 33:20.766
Anyway, the woman who runs it,
her name's Vee.

33:20.899 --> 33:22.368
She's the one
who approached me.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.770
She said she had a client
at another safe house

33:24.903 --> 33:26.138
who needed a job done.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.240
Said she was raiding
a safe deposit box

33:28.374 --> 33:29.575
and it had to
be done quickly,

33:29.708 --> 33:31.677
so she and Jennifer
met in D.C.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.046
Talked about the job.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.381
She said it was personal.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.483
That she was targeting
Raymond Reddington.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.518
She said that you
were more vulnerable

33:39.651 --> 33:41.453
than anyone might believe

33:41.587 --> 33:43.689
and that she was
building an alliance.

33:43.822 --> 33:46.858
And that when this was over,
when Reddington was dead,

33:46.992 --> 33:48.026
that she'd be in my debt.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.795
<i>I told her not to do it.</i>

33:49.928 --> 33:54.866
But this woman,
whoever she is,
she had on blinders.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.204
She had money,
and she was persuasive.

33:58.337 --> 33:59.471
When they met.

34:00.972 --> 34:02.474
Where the woman
was laying low.

34:03.609 --> 34:04.876
Do you know
where that was?

34:05.010 --> 34:08.046
Of course I do.
And I can tell you.

34:08.180 --> 34:10.182
But again,
I want assurances.

34:10.316 --> 34:12.518
You keep my father
out of this.

34:12.651 --> 34:16.455
Raymond, lay this at my feet,
not at Jennifer's.

34:16.588 --> 34:18.590
She's just a kid.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.159
My girl.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.161
Your girl.

34:22.994 --> 34:24.496

34:29.368 --> 34:31.270

She's really gone,
isn't she?

41:41.567 --> 41:42.701
Agent Keen?

41:45.170 --> 41:46.872
I, uh...

41:47.005 --> 41:49.340
I was up all night
thinking about it.

41:49.474 --> 41:51.509
I mean...

41:51.643 --> 41:53.311
I mean,
I know she's gone,

41:53.444 --> 41:57.115
but then I find myself
hoping she isn't, you know?

42:02.087 --> 42:03.521
You think we'll ever
hear from her?

42:03.655 --> 42:05.090
I'm fairly confident

42:05.223 --> 42:07.959
we haven't heard the last
of Agent Keen.
