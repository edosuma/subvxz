have been one real mother–

18:29.441 --> 18:30.359
-[screams]
-[gasps]

18:30.442 --> 18:32.319
-[students groaning]
-[Shrimp grunts]

18:32.402 --> 18:33.862
You kissed somebody already?

18:33.946 --> 18:36.657
[Devi and boy groaning]

18:40.369 --> 18:42.037
Well, well, well.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.997
Hello, KTLA Live at 5.

18:44.081 --> 18:47.084
We are submitting some hard hitting
footage for your Scambusters segment.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.336
What is going on? What…
What are you doing here?

18:49.419 --> 18:50.879
-Kamala, is he in focus?
-Yes.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.714
And not in slow motion
like when we practiced.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.591
Great. This man behind me has left

18:54.675 --> 18:57.928
a multi-generational household of women
stairless for nearly a week.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.806
Please, there's no reason
to send anything to Scambusters.

19:00.889 --> 19:03.100
-Can… Can we just talk about this?
-Fine.

19:03.183 --> 19:04.768
Camera's gonna be still rolling.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.979
Uh, did you just think
you could take advantage of me

19:07.062 --> 19:09.648
because I'm some lowly widow
who can't stand up for herself?

19:09.731 --> 19:11.400
I didn't know you were a widow.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.485
I assumed you were divorced
because of your…

19:14.278 --> 19:15.112
personality.

19:16.822 --> 19:17.656
That's very rude.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.951
-I was planning on coming back next week.
-Ne-- Next week?

19:21.034 --> 19:23.370
We are three women
who are now sharing one bathroom.

19:23.453 --> 19:26.165
Everything is clogged, Andres. Everything.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.458
Listen, I'm not unprofessional, okay?

19:28.542 --> 19:30.002
I just happen to be a little…

19:31.420 --> 19:32.421
spiteful.

19:33.338 --> 19:36.133
I guess I'm still a little mad
about what went down between our girls.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.969
Margot is a sensitive kid,
and I'm raising her on my own.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.596
You're raising her on your own?

19:41.221 --> 19:42.931
My wife ran off in the middle of the night

19:43.015 --> 19:45.642
to open an erotic toy store in Las Vegas
with her new boyfriend.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.311
My story's a little different than yours.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.021
Hey, I'm going to stop filming now.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.064
I think it's starting to feel
a little invasive.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.817
I'm sorry, uh, that
that happened to you, Andres,

19:53.901 --> 19:57.321
and I am sorry about the way
Devi treated your daughter.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.990
But I really do need those stairs.

20:00.824 --> 20:04.036
Yeah. I promise I'll be there
first thing tomorrow.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.996
[gentle music playing]

20:13.420 --> 20:14.379
[sighs]

20:15.422 --> 20:17.174
-You can have him.
-What?

20:17.758 --> 20:19.218
Ethan, he's yours.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.928
I don't even really like him.

20:21.011 --> 20:24.181
I think I just missed Trent
and wanted a distraction.

20:24.264 --> 20:28.518
Aw. El, I'm so sorry.
Why don't you tell Trent how you feel?

20:28.602 --> 20:30.938
I can't. You should have seen
the way he looked today

20:31.021 --> 20:32.856
after he heard that I kissed Ethan.

20:32.940 --> 20:36.235
I haven't seen him look that hurt
since he fell off the Hollywood sign.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.737
I bet he misses you
just as much as you miss him.

20:38.820 --> 20:42.074
I do think about him a lot,
especially at night.

20:42.574 --> 20:47.120
Like, sometimes, I wonder if we're
both looking at the moon at the same time.

20:48.413 --> 20:51.708
Anyway, uh, I'm sorry
things have been tough for you.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.002
That stuff with Ben really sucks.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.588
Yeah, it's not great.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.507
You deserve to have some fun.

20:58.590 --> 21:01.218
And I feel like Ethan knows
how to have some fun.

21:01.301 --> 21:04.346
Like, sexually.
I don't think he's a hobby guy.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.014
-Yeah. Yeah.
-[both chuckle]

21:06.598 --> 21:10.727
-Are you sure you're really cool with it?
-[chuckles] You have my official blessing.

21:10.811 --> 21:11.770
[smacks lips]

21:12.354 --> 21:14.481
Thanks, El. You're a really good friend.
You know that?

21:14.564 --> 21:18.485
Well, one day you can give me
one of your lovers, and we'll be even.

21:18.568 --> 21:19.736
Mmm. [chuckles]

21:19.820 --> 21:20.904
It's a deal.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.364
-All right.
-[chuckles]

21:23.448 --> 21:25.534
How could she move on so fast?

21:25.617 --> 21:27.911
Has she completely forgotten about me?

21:28.662 --> 21:31.456
What about the time
we Lady and the Tramp'ed that Sour Straw?

21:31.540 --> 21:32.916
Did that mean nothing to her?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.626
Dude, I'm so sorry.

21:34.710 --> 21:38.505
Looks like I'm not only a super senior,
but also a mega-cuck.

21:38.588 --> 21:40.090
Hey, come on, man.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.509
Look, you're not gonna feel
like this forever.

21:42.592 --> 21:43.677
I promise you, bro.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.179
All right, I'm gonna grab my bag.
I'll be right back.

21:46.805 --> 21:49.433
[Shrimp] Did you guys see that Paxton
was here for the weekend?

21:49.516 --> 21:52.477
But it turns out he's actually working
at the school now.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.063
It's, like--
It's, like, freaking pathetic. [chuckles]

21:55.147 --> 21:56.356
[boys laugh]

21:56.440 --> 21:58.442
[indistinct chatter]

22:03.739 --> 22:04.740
[Ethan] Hey.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.700
You good? I saw you got bonked by Shrimp.

22:06.783 --> 22:09.494
Ah. Yeah, no,
it wasn't that big of a deal.

22:09.578 --> 22:12.706
Kids said you flew through the air,
and they thought you were dead.

22:12.789 --> 22:14.916
Is there a reason
why you're waiting by my car or--

22:15.000 --> 22:17.878
Oh, yeah, I just, you know,
want to make sure you're okay.

22:19.087 --> 22:21.590
And see if you… [sighs]

22:21.673 --> 22:23.216
…maybe wanted to hang out?

22:24.259 --> 22:25.427
Okay.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.679
Only if you don't kiss my friends though.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.848
And girls who aren't my friends.

22:29.931 --> 22:32.851
I would just prefer
being the only person you're kissing.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.187
-Okay, tough, but fair.
-[chuckles]

22:35.270 --> 22:38.357
I don't know if you noticed,
I grew like a foot over the summer.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.734
[McEnroe] Yeah, dude, she noticed.

22:40.817 --> 22:43.820
And I guess girls are into me now,
or whatever,

22:43.904 --> 22:46.573
so… I got a little greedy.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.242
But I like you.

22:49.826 --> 22:50.869
I like you too.

22:51.453 --> 22:54.539
So yeah, I can chill out
on all the kissing stuff.

22:55.624 --> 22:56.875
Except for…

22:56.958 --> 22:58.960
[upbeat song playing]

22:59.044 --> 22:59.920
…you.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.382
[song continues]

23:59.563 --> 24:01.273
[song ends]
