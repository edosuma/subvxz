00:03.703 --> 00:06.339
Hey, Mom.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.275
Ooh.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.516
Still a couple of guys
gettin' it right.

00:17.917 --> 00:20.687
Hey, flower-gettin' lady,

00:20.721 --> 00:22.722
want me to pick
Dawn up from school?

00:24.557 --> 00:26.993
Mom?

00:27.027 --> 00:28.861
What are you doin'?

00:33.567 --> 00:35.435
Mom?

00:37.537 --> 00:39.406
Mom?

00:42.310 --> 00:44.712
Mommy?

00:46.314 --> 00:47.948
(theme music playing)

01:39.932 --> 01:42.102
I think we're just
about ready for pie.

01:42.135 --> 01:44.604
Then I'll be pretty much
ready for barf.
Xander!

01:44.638 --> 01:47.740
Gross.
No, no,
barf from the eating,

01:47.775 --> 01:49.676
'cause all was good,
and too much goodness--

01:49.710 --> 01:51.478
I'm taking it
as a compliment.

01:51.512 --> 01:54.114
Yes, everything
was delicious.
Yes.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.683
I'm going to barf, too.
Everyone's so sweet.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.355
How you doing there, Wil?
Are you in the vomit club, too?

02:01.388 --> 02:03.022
I had too much nog.

02:03.055 --> 02:05.692
Oh, baby. Want me
to rub your tummy?
She likes it when I--

02:05.725 --> 02:09.362
Uh, s-stop
explaining things.

02:09.395 --> 02:11.931
My nog tastes funny.
I think I got one
with rum in it.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.203
-That's bad.
-Yeah, now Santa's gonna
pass you right by,

02:15.235 --> 02:17.670
naughty booze hound.
(both chuckling)

02:17.704 --> 02:20.707
Santa always passes me by.
Something puts him off.

02:20.740 --> 02:23.977
-Could be the big-honk menorah.
-Did you write him a letter?

02:24.010 --> 02:27.448
-What'd you ask for?
-Um, guys, hello. Puberty?

02:27.480 --> 02:29.349
Sort of figured out
the whole no-Santa thing.

02:29.383 --> 02:32.485
-That's a myth.
-Yeah.

02:32.520 --> 02:36.122
No, I mean, it's a myth
that it's a myth.
There is a Santa Claus.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.293
The advantage of having
a 1,000-year-old girlfriend.
Inside scoop.

02:39.326 --> 02:43.230
-There's a Santa Claus?
-Mm-hmm. Been around
since, like, the 1500s.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.865
But he wasn't
always called Santa.
But, you know,

02:45.899 --> 02:49.537
Christmas night,
flying reindeer, coming
down the chimney-- all true.

02:49.569 --> 02:52.340
All true?

02:52.372 --> 02:55.209
Well, he doesn't traditionally
bring presents

02:55.242 --> 02:57.677
so much as, you know,
disembowel children.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.548
But otherwise--
The reindeer part
was nice.

03:02.115 --> 03:06.019
Damn it.
I hate this oven.
It burnt.

03:06.052 --> 03:09.389
No, it's just blackened.
You know, it's Cajun pie.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.526
Shall I open another?
Do you think we dare?

03:12.560 --> 03:14.427
As long as you two stay away
from the band candy,

03:14.461 --> 03:16.430
I'm cool with anything.

03:16.463 --> 03:19.032
(clears throat)

03:19.066 --> 03:21.200
You are
a demon child.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.437
I live to torment you.
Is that so wrong?

03:23.471 --> 03:25.538
A daughter's duty,
I suppose.

03:25.573 --> 03:28.140
All we have to do is cut off
a little bit of the burnt--
(both gasp)

03:31.545 --> 03:34.081
Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom.

03:34.114 --> 03:36.949
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,
Mom, Mom.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.618
Mom!

03:38.651 --> 03:41.489
(gasping)

03:54.067 --> 03:56.370
WOMAN: 911 emergency.
Hello?

03:56.403 --> 03:58.872
Do you have--
It's my-- my mom.
She-- She's not breathing.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.474
Is she conscious?
No. I-I-I-I can't--

04:01.508 --> 04:04.578
She-- She's not breathing.
 Okay. I need you to give me
 your address.

04:04.611 --> 04:06.879
What?
 I'm gonna send
 an ambulance over.

04:06.913 --> 04:11.251
1630 Revello.
I-I-It's a house.

04:11.284 --> 04:14.587
Revello, near Hadley.
 I'm sending a unit
 right away.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.757
Are you alone
 in the house?
Yes.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.992
And did you see what happened?
 Did she fall?

04:19.026 --> 04:23.129
No. No.
I-I came home and sh--
Wh-What should I do?

04:23.163 --> 04:25.766
Do you know how
 to administer CPR?

04:25.798 --> 04:29.002
No. I don't remember.
 Okay, it's very simple.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.572
You want to tilt
 your mother's head back,

04:31.605 --> 04:34.942
cover her mouth with yours,
 and breathe into her mouth.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.610
I-I know this.
I know this.
 (continues, indistinct)

04:37.644 --> 04:40.314
God. I can do this.

04:40.348 --> 04:43.850
I can do this.
(muttering)

04:43.884 --> 04:46.653
Okay. Okay. There.

04:50.223 --> 04:53.494
One, two, three, four, five,

04:53.526 --> 04:56.663
six, seven, eight--

04:59.667 --> 05:02.101
One, two--
(bones cracking)

05:02.134 --> 05:05.105
Oh! Oh, god.

05:05.137 --> 05:09.108
I-- Are you there?
I-I broke s-something.

05:09.141 --> 05:11.177
Hello?
It cracked.

05:11.211 --> 05:13.279
Is she breathing?
No.

05:13.312 --> 05:15.314
Paramedics should
 be there in a moment.

05:15.348 --> 05:17.817
You might have cracked a rib.
 It's not important.

05:17.850 --> 05:20.620
She's cold.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.790
The body is cold?
No, my mom!

05:23.824 --> 05:26.526
Should-- Should I
make her warm?

05:26.560 --> 05:29.463
No. If she's not responding
 to the CPR,

05:29.497 --> 05:31.899
best thing is to wait
 for the paramedics, okay?

05:31.932 --> 05:34.901
When will they be here?
 They're very nearby.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.137
(vehicle approaching)

05:37.170 --> 05:39.372
You just--
(vehicle passes by)

05:41.274 --> 05:45.345
Stay calm.
 When the paramedics arrive--

05:46.913 --> 05:49.716
(operator continues,
 indistinct)

05:55.723 --> 05:58.057
(calmly)
I have to make a call.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.293
(sniffles)

06:08.701 --> 06:10.737
(automatic dialing)

06:10.771 --> 06:13.574
(line ringing)

06:16.944 --> 06:20.747
GILES: Hello?
Giles, you have to come.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.382
Buffy?

06:22.415 --> 06:25.018
She's at the house.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.819
(phone beeps off)

06:28.422 --> 06:31.759
(siren approaching)

06:39.500 --> 06:41.735
(brakes screech)

06:41.769 --> 06:44.737
(car door opens)

06:45.973 --> 06:47.740
(car door closes)

06:57.350 --> 06:59.519
(footsteps approaching)

07:01.988 --> 07:03.355
She's in here.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.937
-I'm getting no pulse.
-Let's lay her out.

07:22.810 --> 07:27.615
-How long's she been like this?
-I found her-- A few minutes.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.016
-Was she conscious?
-No.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.252
I'm baggin' her.
What?

07:32.284 --> 07:35.288
We're gonna intubate. Just
trying to get her to breathe.
All right? This your mother?

07:35.322 --> 07:37.456
Yes.
She have any serious
physical health problems?

07:37.490 --> 07:39.959
-Any history
of heart disease or--
-No.

07:39.992 --> 07:43.997
I mean, there-there was a tumor,
a-a brain tumor.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.165
But-But she had an operation,
and she's fine now.

07:46.199 --> 07:49.002
She's-- She's been fine.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.504
(air whooshing)

07:57.343 --> 08:00.146
-(coughing)
-We got her!
My god, we got her!

08:00.180 --> 08:02.449
Let's get her
on the truck now.
Call it in ahead.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.350
-I never brought one back
this late.
-Buffy.

08:04.384 --> 08:08.120
-I'm here.
-(siren wailing)

08:08.154 --> 08:11.458
It's a miracle.
That's what it is,
a beautiful miracle.

08:11.490 --> 08:14.661
Good as new.
Buffy, thank god
you found me in time.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.678
She's cold, man.

08:35.414 --> 08:36.850
Call it.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.365
I'm sorry.
Wh-What do we do now?

08:53.399 --> 08:55.903
I'm sorry, but I have
to tell you that...

08:55.936 --> 08:58.871
your mother's dead.

08:58.905 --> 09:02.009
It looks like
she did die a good while
before you found her.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.277
There's... nothing
you could have done.

09:07.615 --> 09:11.250
What--
I'm guessing it must've been
an aneurysm or some clotting.

09:11.283 --> 09:14.187
Some complication
from surgery.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.423
She probably felt...

09:16.456 --> 09:19.392
very little pain.

09:19.426 --> 09:22.195
I'm gonna call it in.
The coroner's office will
come by and take her in,

09:22.229 --> 09:24.764
and they'll determine
the cause of death
conclusively.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.033
MAN ON RADIO:
 Dispatch seven,
 we have a 2-0-6.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.937
What's your status?
We're moving.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.605
Location is Beaumont and 9th.
 Your vic is on the street.

09:32.639 --> 09:34.407
Go now.
Okay. We gotta fly.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.943
All right. I'm gonna
call this right away.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.912
Now, the coroner's office
may take a while.

09:38.946 --> 09:41.380
In the meanwhile,
I think you should sit,

09:41.413 --> 09:44.584
have a glass of water
and try not to disturb the body.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.822
Do you need anything?
Is there someone you can call?

09:48.855 --> 09:52.759
Someone's coming.
Let's go.

09:57.965 --> 10:01.033
I'm very sorry
for your loss.
Thank you.

10:05.437 --> 10:07.841
(sniffling)

10:11.778 --> 10:13.346
Good luck.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.484
(car doors closing)

10:19.119 --> 10:20.653
(engine starts)

10:23.023 --> 10:25.826
(vehicle departing)

10:30.062 --> 10:32.832
(siren, distant)

10:38.971 --> 10:39.972
(puts phone down)

10:48.816 --> 10:52.519
(vomiting)
(wind chimes ringing)

11:04.865 --> 11:07.600
(chimes continue ringing)

11:13.206 --> 11:16.043
(children playing)

11:47.941 --> 11:50.543
(chimes continue ringing)

12:01.120 --> 12:04.591
Buffy! What is it?
Is it Glory?

12:06.058 --> 12:09.129
I'm waiting.
The-- The coroner's coming.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.767
-What?
-I have to tell Dawn.

12:13.801 --> 12:17.570
Sh-She's at school.
I'll go there.

12:17.604 --> 12:20.874
I'm not sure-- Oh, god.
No. No.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.409
-Don't. No. No, it's too late.
-Joyce?

12:23.442 --> 12:26.613
-They're coming for her.
No. No, we're--
-Joyce!

12:26.645 --> 12:28.681
We're not supposed
to move the body!

12:34.187 --> 12:36.523
(crying softly)

12:56.143 --> 12:57.777
(zippering continues)

12:57.811 --> 13:01.214
(gasps)
Oh, god.

13:02.514 --> 13:04.484
I can't believe it.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.953
GIRL: It's not that bad.

13:06.986 --> 13:09.255
How can you say
it's not that bad?

13:09.288 --> 13:12.524
I just don't think
it's that big a deal.
(toilet flushing)

13:12.558 --> 13:16.163
Kevin Berman called me a freak
in front of everybody.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.365
No, that's no big deal.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.869
He didn't say
you were a freak.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.205
Forget it.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.307
He just said
you were freaky,

13:27.340 --> 13:30.809
which, you know,
freaky can be
sort of cool.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.513
Yeah. Real cool.

13:33.546 --> 13:37.517
I'm a suicidal head case.
You know it was Kirstie.

13:37.549 --> 13:39.552
She was telling people
how you were into
cutting yourself and--

13:39.586 --> 13:41.488
That's such a lie!

13:41.520 --> 13:44.557
I got cut,
by accident, one time.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.125
Now Kevin thinks I'm--

13:46.158 --> 13:49.296
Well, that was when you were
wigging out about your family.

13:49.328 --> 13:54.000
And, of course, Kirstie's gotta
turn everything into a story.
(sighs)

13:54.033 --> 13:56.836
She was telling people
that you were adopted.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.806
What a prima biatch.

13:59.838 --> 14:02.174
I swear, if I could
make her head explode

14:02.208 --> 14:04.677
using only
the power of my mind,

14:04.711 --> 14:06.778
that's what I'd be doing
right about now.

14:08.847 --> 14:12.585
Great. Now I look
like a wet rat.

14:12.619 --> 14:15.022
Yeah. You know
you can't go out there
looking all cry-face.

14:15.054 --> 14:17.856
That'll just give
Kirstie more ammo.
(bell ringing)

14:17.890 --> 14:21.727
You know, my big sister
could really beat
the crap out of her.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.730
I mean, really, really.

14:26.732 --> 14:29.269
What do you think?

14:29.302 --> 14:31.038
Can I show my face?

14:31.071 --> 14:33.740
You're good to go.
We're gonna be late anyway.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.414
Kirstie alert.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.518
-Hey, Dawn.
-Hey.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.620
How you doing?
You okay?
Good. Thanks for asking.

14:49.956 --> 14:52.658
(quietly)
Biatch.
(bell rings)

14:58.431 --> 15:00.700
TEACHER: Okay, remember,

15:00.732 --> 15:03.937
we're not drawing the object.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.738
We're drawing...

15:05.772 --> 15:09.808
the negative space
around the object.

15:09.841 --> 15:12.312
We just draw the edges.
Hi.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.148
Oh. Hey, Kevin.
And then give me a sense

15:15.182 --> 15:17.750
of the spaces around,

15:17.783 --> 15:20.653
the space in between.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.389
What's going on?

15:23.423 --> 15:26.658
Um, negative space.

15:26.692 --> 15:29.495
Yeah.
What's that all about?

15:29.528 --> 15:32.899
Yeah.
(scoffs)

15:32.932 --> 15:36.003
That's pretty good.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.638
Thanks.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.110
(gasps quietly)

15:45.677 --> 15:48.014
So I heard you, like,
had a freak-out
and cut yourself.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.783
No. Not even.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.951
It was a whole--
It was so not--

15:52.985 --> 15:54.653
I felt like that before.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.325
Things get so crazed,
you know?

15:58.357 --> 16:01.927
You just feel like you want
to do something... extreme.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.096
Yeah.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.932
I just had a lot of
intense stuff going on.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.302
A lot of people
don't understand that...

16:10.336 --> 16:12.139
pain.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.807
Yeah.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.177
Then Kirstie's gotta
blab it everywhere
'cause she's--

16:17.210 --> 16:19.879
Kirstie, man.
It's like she thinks,

16:19.912 --> 16:22.548
"I'm so hot,
everybody should just
bow down before me."

16:22.581 --> 16:25.418
And I'm, like, "Whatever."

16:26.818 --> 16:28.620
She's so superficial.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.124
Everything's always
about clothes
or who likes who,

16:31.158 --> 16:34.461
and there's just
way more important
stuff going on.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.163
There's a lot of crucial,

16:37.197 --> 16:39.298
you know, stuff.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.168
Yeah.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.570
This one time
in history,

16:43.602 --> 16:45.672
she had this book called
 Annals of History,

16:45.705 --> 16:48.740
and she didn't know how
to say the word "annals,"

16:48.774 --> 16:50.177
so she kept saying--
Dawn.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.517
I have to talk to you.

17:02.754 --> 17:05.458
Um, what?

17:07.193 --> 17:09.996
Can it wait?
I'm in the middle of class.

17:10.028 --> 17:14.031
I know.
Please come with me.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.246
I thought Mom
was picking me up.

17:30.650 --> 17:34.086
What's going on?
Something's going on.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.556
Let's go outside--
No. Tell me
what's going on.

17:37.923 --> 17:40.926
It's... bad... news.

17:42.261 --> 17:45.064
Well, what is it?
What happened?

17:46.665 --> 17:50.136
-It's bad. Please, can we--
-Where's Mom?

17:53.839 --> 17:55.907
Mom h-had an accident.

17:57.109 --> 17:58.877
Or, um,

17:58.911 --> 18:02.615
something went wrong
from the tumor.

18:03.849 --> 18:06.051
Is she okay?

18:06.085 --> 18:09.155
Is she--
But she's okay?

18:09.189 --> 18:12.659
But it's--
it's serious-- but--

18:12.692 --> 18:14.661
Dawn.

18:22.934 --> 18:25.637
(muted)
No!
(sobbing)

18:32.479 --> 18:35.748
No! No, it's not true!

18:35.781 --> 18:38.218
You're a liar!
She's fine!

18:42.054 --> 18:44.923
(muted)
Please, it's not true.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.026
She's fine.
Oh, no!

18:47.058 --> 18:49.796
No! No!
(sobbing)

18:49.828 --> 18:51.798
No!

19:10.416 --> 19:13.353
(cutting continues)

19:39.378 --> 19:41.548
I think they're here.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.425
Do you wanna come up?

19:55.927 --> 19:57.730
You're double-parked.

20:00.098 --> 20:02.101
Let them
give me a ticket.

20:02.134 --> 20:05.538
What do you think?
The purple, right?

20:05.571 --> 20:07.574
'Cause-- 'Cause it's somber?

20:08.807 --> 20:12.178
No. No,
it's too depressing.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.013
It's like I'm a funeral guy.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.518
Well, this is--
this is cheerier.

20:18.550 --> 20:22.954
Maybe I wanna be cheery, like--
like everything is normal.

20:22.989 --> 20:26.292
No, that's-- that's rude.
That's-- It's disrespectful.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.595
* La la la
I don't care.

20:28.627 --> 20:32.699
(grunts)
If I had that blue one--

20:32.731 --> 20:35.233
Joy-- Joyce really liked
the blue one.

20:35.268 --> 20:38.871
She told me one time.
You sure it's not
in your room?

20:38.904 --> 20:41.641
I-I-I can look again.

20:41.673 --> 20:45.877
No. No. I-I should--
I should wear the purple.

20:45.912 --> 20:49.248
The purple.
I-I think the-- the purple.

20:49.281 --> 20:53.251
I-It's just that it's so--
I don't know.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.622
It doesn't mean something bad?

20:55.654 --> 20:58.458
I think it's, um, royal.

20:58.490 --> 21:01.760
Purple means... royalty.

21:01.794 --> 21:05.632
Well, I can't see Buffy
at the morgue and be all royal.

21:05.664 --> 21:09.469
"Oh, I'm the king of everything.
I'm better than you."

21:09.501 --> 21:13.339
I have to be supportive.
Buffy needs me to be
supportive. I need--

21:13.373 --> 21:15.508
(crying, breathing heavily)

21:15.541 --> 21:20.380
Oh, god. Why do
all of my shirts have to have
stupid things on them?

21:21.614 --> 21:24.451
Why can't I just
dress like a grownup?

21:24.483 --> 21:27.118
Can't I be a grownup?

21:27.153 --> 21:29.955
Shh.
Tara.

21:29.989 --> 21:33.692
Shh, darling.
I can't do this.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.471
We can do this.

21:45.505 --> 21:48.708
Okay. We can be there
for Buffy.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.344
And Dawn.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.980
Little Dawn.

21:56.048 --> 22:00.118
We can be strong.
Strong like an amazon?

22:00.152 --> 22:01.988
Strong like an amazon,
right.

22:03.221 --> 22:04.656
Okay.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.894
I wish I had the blue.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.866
So, what do we do?

22:14.901 --> 22:16.836
I'm not sure.

22:16.868 --> 22:18.938
Willow talked
to Giles.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.517
But what will we do?

22:30.549 --> 22:32.919
What will we
be expected to do?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.595
(knocks)

22:45.698 --> 22:47.467
Hey.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.144
How you doing?

23:00.547 --> 23:03.415
I know the feeling.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.952
I'm afraid I'm gonna
start to cry again.

23:09.154 --> 23:11.423
Xander cried
at the apartment.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.358
It was weird.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.828
Yeah, it-it's a--
it's a thing we do.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.345
What's going to happen?

23:34.580 --> 23:36.982
Well, I-- I-I guess

23:37.016 --> 23:39.919
we're gonna meet them
at the morgue.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.655
That's where they
were taking her.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.759
Um, Giles said that he
was gonna go with Joyce,

23:46.792 --> 23:51.329
and Buffy was gonna go to...
the school to tell Dawn.

23:53.365 --> 23:55.233
God.

23:55.267 --> 23:58.738
Do you know how to--
how to get--
XANDER: Yeah.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.907
It's at the hospital.
It's a wing.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.976
We do morgue time
in the Scooby Gang.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.781
I have to change.

24:13.486 --> 24:17.155
-What else did Giles say?
-Not a lot.

24:17.189 --> 24:21.093
Are they sure this was...
natural? I mean, Glory--

24:21.126 --> 24:23.762
Giles is pretty sure that
it wasn't-- it wasn't her.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.298
But she said she was gonna
come after Buffy's family.

24:26.332 --> 24:27.834
I don't think--
We should be going after her.

24:27.866 --> 24:31.202
I mean, she could have done it
and-- and covered her tracks.

24:31.237 --> 24:34.807
Wh-Why would she?
She'd want us to know.

24:37.576 --> 24:39.811
I'll tell you what it is.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.780
It's the frickin' doctors.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.182
I mean, they just let her out,
you know? Clean bill of health.

24:44.215 --> 24:46.952
Dig a hole in your skull.
Here's a Band-Aid. Next!

24:46.986 --> 24:48.988
WILLOW: Xander.
They should have
checked her over.

24:49.020 --> 24:51.123
They should have
had her in.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.525
We don't we have enough
monsters in this town

24:52.558 --> 24:54.226
that doctors
gotta help them out?

24:54.259 --> 24:56.596
WILLOW: Xander, I--
I don't think it was...
anyone--

24:58.897 --> 25:00.365
It just happened.

25:02.268 --> 25:04.470
Things don't happen!

25:04.502 --> 25:07.773
I mean,
they don't just happen.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.176
Somebody's--

25:11.210 --> 25:14.012
I mean, somebody's got--

25:15.413 --> 25:17.549
Okay.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.518
Let's go.

25:19.551 --> 25:21.487
Come on. You and me.

25:21.519 --> 25:23.422
Come on.

25:36.067 --> 25:38.904
You know I can't take you.

25:38.938 --> 25:41.807
Damn straight.

25:43.576 --> 25:46.211
-Are we gonna see the body?
-What?

25:48.914 --> 25:52.218
Are we gonna
be in the room...
with the dead body?

25:53.720 --> 25:57.056
I don't know. No.

25:57.088 --> 26:00.226
But I guess we should
take over patrolling
and all that.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.193
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.963
-For however long.
-XANDER: You know it.

26:06.498 --> 26:08.567
I can't wear this.

26:10.636 --> 26:13.305
I-I really should
have the other.

26:14.973 --> 26:16.608
Joyce liked it so.

26:16.643 --> 26:18.611
Do you think
you could have left it
in the laundry room?

26:21.113 --> 26:23.950
-Maybe.
-I'll go check.

26:23.982 --> 26:26.952
-I'll just be one minute.
-We're cool.

26:31.958 --> 26:35.260
-Are they gonna
cut the body open?
-Oh, my god!

26:35.294 --> 26:40.132
Would you just stop talking?
Just shut your mouth, please!

26:40.165 --> 26:42.902
-What am I doing?
-How can you act like that?

26:42.934 --> 26:45.771
Am I supposed to be
changing my clothes a lot?

26:45.805 --> 26:47.605
Is that the helpful thing
to do?
Guys--

26:47.640 --> 26:50.142
-The way you behave--
-Nobody will tell me.

26:50.175 --> 26:53.179
Because it's not okay for you
to be asking these things!

26:53.211 --> 26:57.750
But I don't understand!
I don't understand

26:57.784 --> 27:00.618
how this all happens,
how we go through this.

27:00.653 --> 27:03.189
I mean, I knew her,
and then she's--

27:03.221 --> 27:05.958
There's just a body,
and I don't understand

27:05.991 --> 27:10.128
why she just
can't get back in it
and not be dead anymore.

27:10.162 --> 27:13.632
It's stupid.
It's mortal and stupid.

27:13.665 --> 27:16.102
And-- And Xander's crying
and not talking.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.805
And I was having fruit punch,
and I thought,

27:18.837 --> 27:22.273
"Joyce will never have
any more fruit punch, ever,

27:22.307 --> 27:26.846
and she'll never have eggs
or yawn or brush her hair,
not ever."

27:26.878 --> 27:30.182
And no one
will explain to me why.

27:48.034 --> 27:50.903
We don't know...

27:50.936 --> 27:53.972
how it works.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.008
Why.

28:29.808 --> 28:32.845
(crash)
XANDER: Sorry.

28:32.878 --> 28:36.048
Sorry. Some...

28:36.082 --> 28:38.450
pent-up--
Xander.

28:40.920 --> 28:44.022
-Where did your hand go?
-As I was saying,
some frustration,

28:44.056 --> 28:47.526
and now, um,
I appear to be stuck.

28:47.558 --> 28:49.228
Oh, my god.

28:50.461 --> 28:53.031
Is your hand okay?

28:53.065 --> 28:55.401
Pretty much.
I'm really sorry.

28:57.169 --> 29:01.140
You could have hit
an electrical... thing!

29:01.173 --> 29:03.509
And once again
with the sorry.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.577
Did it make you
feel better?

29:06.612 --> 29:08.747
For a second there.

29:08.780 --> 29:10.782
A whole second?

29:10.817 --> 29:13.085
In my defense,
some crappy wallmanship.

29:13.118 --> 29:16.823
Yeah, you can hear
everything next door.

29:16.855 --> 29:20.926
Who did the drywall
in this place?
I always forget to ask.

29:20.960 --> 29:24.063
Did I miss something?
Xander decided that
he blames the wall.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.498
Can you turn your wrist?

29:26.531 --> 29:30.169
Hold on.
(grunting)

29:30.201 --> 29:33.239
Oh!
Ooh! Oh.

29:33.271 --> 29:35.374
It's okay.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.212
It hurts.

29:44.182 --> 29:46.617
WILLOW: Here, wash it off.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.489
Band-Aids?
Underneath.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.894
I couldn't find it.
It doesn't matter.

29:57.128 --> 30:00.298
We should get there.
Yes.

30:00.332 --> 30:03.434
I wanna be there for Buffy.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.104
XANDER: You're right.

30:05.136 --> 30:08.440
The avengers gotta get
with the assembly.

30:08.473 --> 30:12.377
We'll go. We'll deal.
We'll help.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.145
That's what we do.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.981
We help Buffy.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.651
How are we going to help?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.102
(door closes)

31:32.991 --> 31:35.760
(woman on PA, indistinct)

31:39.730 --> 31:41.133
Is there
anything we can do?

31:42.667 --> 31:44.470
Glad you're here.

31:50.342 --> 31:53.045
Love you so much.
I know.

31:53.078 --> 31:54.779
They're not
telling us anything.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.419
(sniffling)

32:04.855 --> 32:06.758
Doctor?

32:21.339 --> 32:23.474
Okay, I've examined
your mother's body.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.310
Can we see her?

32:25.344 --> 32:28.079
Dawn, not now.

32:28.114 --> 32:31.817
The on-site report seems
more or less accurate.

32:31.849 --> 32:34.319
Your mother did have
what looks like
an aneurysm--

32:34.353 --> 32:39.525
a sudden hemorrhaging
from a ruptured arterial
vessel near the, uh--

32:39.557 --> 32:41.359
where the tumor
was removed.

32:41.393 --> 32:46.464
Shouldn't we have
known about that--
that was a danger?

32:46.498 --> 32:50.769
Sometimes these things
are detectable,
and sometimes they're not.

32:50.801 --> 32:53.372
Joyce was aware of the
possibility of a rupture,

32:53.404 --> 32:55.641
and the effects.

32:55.673 --> 32:59.478
She didn't even
get on the phone, so,
clearly, this was very sudden.

33:01.212 --> 33:03.615
She, uh, may have
felt a little nausea,

33:03.648 --> 33:06.718
and probably passed out
as it happened.

33:06.751 --> 33:09.555
I doubt there was much pain.

33:09.587 --> 33:12.023
And even if someone
had been by her side--

33:12.057 --> 33:13.825
My head.
Mom!

33:13.858 --> 33:16.362
It's doubtful that
 this could have been
 dealt with in time.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.836
Uh, thank you, Doctor.

33:25.871 --> 33:30.209
Are you sure...
that there wasn't a lot of pain?

33:30.241 --> 33:32.478
Absolutely.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.346
DOCTOR'S VOICE: I have to lie
 to make you feel better.

33:36.882 --> 33:40.251
What, uh, needs
to be done now?

33:40.286 --> 33:42.921
Well, there, uh--
there'll be some forms

33:42.953 --> 33:45.391
and some decisions
you'll need to make.

33:45.423 --> 33:49.560
Uh, Buffy, why don't you let me
handle this as much as I can?
Please.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.230
We will need you
to sign a couple
of release forms.

33:52.263 --> 33:54.665
Yes, thank you, Doctor.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.635
I'll figure out which ones
you need to see.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.073
We'll be here.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.444
What did the doctor say?

34:06.478 --> 34:08.579
Nothing.
That it's, you know--

34:08.614 --> 34:10.782
it's what we thought--
a tumor.

34:12.117 --> 34:14.286
Why don't we sit down?

34:19.958 --> 34:23.762
Giles says he's gonna
go over the paperwork.

34:23.795 --> 34:26.431
Man, if there's one day
they should not
give you homework--

34:27.833 --> 34:29.668
Dawnie, do you wanna sit?

34:31.436 --> 34:33.639
I don't think we're gonna
have to be here very long.

34:34.639 --> 34:38.844
-What about--
-What about what?

34:40.478 --> 34:43.114
Nothing. I have to pee.

34:43.148 --> 34:45.251
Do you want someone
to go with you?

34:45.284 --> 34:48.454
No. I still remember
how to pee.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.755
Do you know
where it is?
Yeah.

34:54.293 --> 34:57.429
I think maybe she's
mad at me or something.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.065
'Cause you were
the one that told her?

35:01.099 --> 35:03.768
How'd she take it?

35:03.802 --> 35:05.704
Meltdown.

35:06.838 --> 35:09.840
She just wouldn't believe me.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.842
I still don't think she does.

35:13.179 --> 35:14.813
I wish that
Joyce didn't die...

35:18.884 --> 35:20.318
because she was nice.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.855
And now we all hurt.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.827
Anya, ever the wordsmith.

35:30.862 --> 35:33.498
Thank you.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.603
Do you want anything?

35:37.635 --> 35:40.771
Something to eat
or a soda?

35:40.806 --> 35:44.041
Honestly,
I-I couldn't tell.

35:44.074 --> 35:47.545
Well, I think you should
try to eat something.

35:47.579 --> 35:50.782
Yeah, maybe Dawn
could use a snack.

35:50.815 --> 35:54.385
I'll find something.
Xander, do you have any money?

35:54.420 --> 35:56.288
We'll come with.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.088
We'll be right quick.

36:08.266 --> 36:11.436
I'm sorry... you have to
go through all of this.

36:13.204 --> 36:15.039
You don't have to
worry about me.

36:18.108 --> 36:20.177
Everybody wants to help.

36:22.213 --> 36:25.951
I don't even know
if I'm... here.

36:27.418 --> 36:29.454
I don't know
what's going on.

36:31.789 --> 36:33.592
I've never done this.

36:35.059 --> 36:38.396
That's just an amazingly
dumb thing to say.

36:38.429 --> 36:41.932
Obviously, I've never
done this before.

36:47.137 --> 36:49.875
I have.

36:49.907 --> 36:52.311
My mother died
when I was 17.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.215
I didn't know.

36:58.250 --> 36:59.885
I'm sorry.

36:59.918 --> 37:02.119
No, no,
I didn't mean to--

37:03.755 --> 37:06.358
I'm only telling you
this because--

37:06.391 --> 37:08.960
I know it's not
m-my place, but...

37:10.561 --> 37:12.331
there's things--

37:13.599 --> 37:16.268
thoughts and reactions
I had that I couldn't...

37:17.635 --> 37:19.704
understand...

37:19.737 --> 37:23.074
or even try to explain
to anyone else.

37:24.443 --> 37:28.614
Thoughts that made me feel
like I was losing it,

37:28.646 --> 37:32.016
or like I was some kind
of h-horrible person.

37:34.820 --> 37:37.121
I know it's
different for you,

37:39.157 --> 37:40.958
because it's
always different, but...

37:41.960 --> 37:43.795
if you ever need--

37:58.175 --> 38:00.746
Was it sudden?

38:00.778 --> 38:03.815
What?
Your mother.

38:05.182 --> 38:07.117
No.

38:08.719 --> 38:10.989
And yes.

38:13.157 --> 38:15.360
It's always sudden.

38:23.369 --> 38:24.635
(no audible dialogue)

40:36.101 --> 40:39.471
-We panicked.
-Uh-huh.

40:39.505 --> 40:41.672
Have anything
you want.

40:41.706 --> 40:43.775
The sandwiches
are meat.

40:44.643 --> 40:47.445
I'm just not hungry.

40:47.478 --> 40:50.414
What about Dawnie?

40:50.447 --> 40:53.985
-Is she still in the bathroom?
-I guess.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.188
You guys wait here.

41:31.922 --> 41:33.490
(Dawn screaming, muted)

41:39.030 --> 41:40.766
-(screaming continues)
-(Buffy shouting)

41:43.068 --> 41:45.070
(growling)

42:07.458 --> 42:10.728
(fighting continues)

42:27.277 --> 42:29.047
(bones cracking)
(groans)

42:41.760 --> 42:43.594
Dawn?

43:07.418 --> 43:09.487
Is she cold?

43:11.822 --> 43:13.659
It's not her.

43:16.094 --> 43:17.795
It's not her.

43:18.829 --> 43:20.666
She's gone.

43:24.101 --> 43:25.936
Where'd she go?

44:18.523 --> 44:20.925
Grr! Arrgh!
