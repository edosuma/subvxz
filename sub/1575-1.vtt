I've raised this tree
since it was a young sapling.

00:58.333 --> 01:00.125
It's like the child I never had.

01:00.208 --> 01:01.667
Aw.

01:01.750 --> 01:03.500
Now that Santa is dead,
we can finally

01:03.583 --> 01:04.834
celebrate Christmas again.

01:04.917 --> 01:07.000
This is going to be
the best Christmas ever.

01:07.083 --> 01:08.875
Guys, guys, guys,
guy, guy, guys.

01:08.959 --> 01:10.667
I just came up with
an awesome new dance.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.375
You got to see it.

01:12.458 --> 01:13.875
Guys?

01:15.125 --> 01:17.667
Guys! You got see me
rock this dance.

01:17.750 --> 01:19.959
It's half twerking,
half motorboating,

01:20.041 --> 01:23.125
100% sexuality.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.417
Hey,
what are you doing?

01:25.500 --> 01:27.041
I'm sewing
Christmas stockings

01:27.125 --> 01:29.083
that actually fit
everyone's feet.

01:29.166 --> 01:31.000
I came up
with the idea myself.

01:31.083 --> 01:32.125
Can you believe it?

01:32.208 --> 01:33.792
I can. Ich!

01:33.875 --> 01:35.667
It's always about
Christmas in this house.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.208
I'm sick of it.
I'm going to find someone

01:37.291 --> 01:40.041
who will appreciate me
and my dance.

01:40.125 --> 01:42.291
And zippity-zappity-zoo.

01:44.917 --> 01:46.917
Thank you.
Thank you, Snot.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.083
I ju-- I just knew
you'd love it.

01:49.166 --> 01:53.500
Uh-huh.
So, you're Steve's uncle?

01:53.583 --> 01:55.125
That's right.
I'm Uncle Roger.

01:55.208 --> 01:57.500
Are you
Mr. Smith's brother?

01:57.583 --> 02:00.542
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No. I'm not related
to Stan or Francine.

02:00.625 --> 02:02.500
I'm Steve's direct uncle.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.250
I only came over
because the whole family

02:04.333 --> 02:06.125
is obsessed
with Christmas.

02:06.208 --> 02:08.125
I-I just don't get it.
You ever feel that way?

02:08.208 --> 02:11.750
Well, yeah. I'm Jewish,
so I celebrate Hanukkah.

02:11.834 --> 02:14.291
What's that?
It's an 8-day celebration

02:14.375 --> 02:15.917
called
the Festival of Lights.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.542
And tonight's
the first night.

02:17.625 --> 02:20.166
On each night, we light
a candle to symbolize

02:20.250 --> 02:23.542
how one night's supply
of oil lasted eight nights.

02:23.625 --> 02:27.041
Sometimes we play
dreidel or eat latkes,

02:27.125 --> 02:29.750
and sometimes we don't
and just go to bed.

02:29.834 --> 02:31.959
It's kind of boring.

02:32.041 --> 02:33.917
But it's cool that you
have your own thing.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.208
Not really.

02:35.291 --> 02:37.959
Hanukkah has always been
second fiddle to Christmas.

02:38.041 --> 02:41.959
We don't have any catchy songs
or Santa or anything.

02:42.041 --> 02:44.333
This is a tough time
of the year for us.

02:44.417 --> 02:46.125
Are there, or have
there ever been,

02:46.208 --> 02:48.208
other tough times
for Jewish people?

02:49.709 --> 02:51.291
Yes.

02:51.375 --> 02:53.625
Hey, you know what?
As Christmas outsiders,

02:53.709 --> 02:55.208
the two of us
should stick together.

02:55.291 --> 02:57.291
Neither of us should
suffer alone in this,

02:57.375 --> 02:58.583
the toughest of times.

02:58.667 --> 03:00.792
I'm going to celebrate
Hanukkah with you.

03:00.875 --> 03:04.041
So, how do I become Jewish?
Do I just -- Do I just kiss you?

03:04.125 --> 03:05.667
Let's start
with some reading.

03:05.750 --> 03:09.083
The Book of Creation.
That sounds juicy.

03:09.166 --> 03:11.333
That's too advanced
for you.

03:11.417 --> 03:15.625
If you want to become Jewish,
you must first study the Torah.

03:15.709 --> 03:19.500
In the beginning, God
created heaven and Earth.

03:19.583 --> 03:21.417
Hey, they lifted
that line from the Bible.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.834
This is going to be fun.

works at Home Depot?

I'ma show everyone.

Yep. That's what
I'm going to do.

06:40.875 --> 06:42.125
Don't drink my drink

06:44.834 --> 06:46.750
Hey. Where --
Where are you all going?

06:46.834 --> 06:48.709
I told you Santa was dead.

06:48.792 --> 06:51.000
Don't you want to see
his dead body?

06:51.083 --> 06:53.542
Whoa!
There really is a Santa.

06:53.625 --> 06:54.750
Not anymore.

06:54.834 --> 06:58.458
Santa's so dumb. Look at --
Look at his dumb suit.

06:58.542 --> 07:00.041
Seems warm, though.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.375
I could use
something like this.

07:01.458 --> 07:04.083
I'm literally always cold.
I'm like a woman.

07:04.166 --> 07:06.542
Hot take, Roger, hot take.

07:06.625 --> 07:07.750
What the hell,
I'm going to try it on.

07:12.208 --> 07:14.375
Was that the sesame chicken
I had earlier?

Let's see if...

♪♪

07:19.959 --> 07:21.834

turns whoever is
wearing it into Santa.

07:24.291 --> 07:26.208
But how can I be Santa?

07:26.291 --> 07:28.625
I'm Jewish.

07:28.709 --> 07:33.417
Could I be Jewish Santa
with Santa powers?

07:36.834 --> 07:38.542
Awesome!
Hey!

07:38.625 --> 07:40.125
What the hell
are you doing?!

07:42.208 --> 07:43.583
Shut up, key man!

07:43.667 --> 07:45.875
There's a new
Santa Claus in town,

07:45.959 --> 07:48.834
and his name's...
Shmanta.

07:48.917 --> 07:51.000
Challah at Jew-boy!

07:55.834 --> 07:57.500
Hey, y'all.
It's me, Greg.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.375
I'm here at
the Langley Falls Galleria

07:59.458 --> 08:02.208
with breaking news so urgent
that I got called away from

08:02.291 --> 08:05.041
a daytime rager
at my friend's new townhouse.

08:05.125 --> 08:07.875
Santa Claus, yes,
the Santa Claus,

08:07.959 --> 08:10.250
is slated to make
an historic announcement.

08:10.333 --> 08:12.583
Speaking of announcements,
I kissed a woman earlier,

08:12.667 --> 08:14.041
and it wasn't weird.

08:14.125 --> 08:15.542
I thought
Santa was dead.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.583
It's probably just
a crazy impostor,

08:17.667 --> 08:19.417
but can you believe
the news about Greg?

08:19.500 --> 08:22.333
Why would it feel weird?
We were just having fun.

08:22.417 --> 08:23.709
It was a rager.

08:23.792 --> 08:25.458
He needs to relax.

08:25.542 --> 08:27.458
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the moment

08:27.542 --> 08:29.250
you've all been waiting for.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.917
Santa Claus is real!

08:32.000 --> 08:34.959
And he's Jewish!

08:36.166 --> 08:37.625
Of course.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.083
What are you doing?

08:42.166 --> 08:44.250
All Hanukkah needs
is a Santa.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.583
I'm putting us
on the map.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.250
So, you're Santa?

08:47.333 --> 08:49.959
I go by Shmanta because
I celebrate Hanukkah now.

08:50.041 --> 08:51.458
Why, you might ask?
I didn't.

08:51.542 --> 08:53.458
During Hanukkah,
you get eight days

08:53.542 --> 08:54.959
of presents
instead of one.

08:55.041 --> 08:56.959
That's eight times
better than Christmas,

put out lox and bagels.

Christmas present?

20:32.375 --> 20:33.625
How'd you have time
to shop?

20:33.709 --> 20:35.917
This is a gift I was
born with...

20:36.000 --> 20:37.792
my dance!

20:37.875 --> 20:39.250
Pbhhhhht!

20:39.333 --> 20:41.750
Unh-eh-eh-eh.
Whoa.

20:41.834 --> 20:43.709
Unh-eh-eh-eh.

20:43.792 --> 20:44.959
Unh-eh-eh-eh.

20:45.041 --> 20:48.166
So, you want to get Chinese
food and watch a movie?

20:48.250 --> 20:50.750
Of course, mom.
It's tradition.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.208
Unh! Unh!
Oh, yeah.

20:52.291 --> 20:53.333
Unh-eh.

20:53.417 --> 20:56.375
Now, here's a little move
I call the Hatchimal.

20:56.458 --> 20:57.750
Whoo!

20:58.875 --> 21:01.166
Oh, grow up, everyone.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.166
Bye!
Have a great time!

21:05.250 --> 21:07.000
