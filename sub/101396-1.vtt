WEBVTT

00:26.018 --> 00:29.019
Never in Grit's history
have we asked a player to leave

00:29.021 --> 00:31.021
without a tribunal vote.

00:31.023 --> 00:32.756
But there will be no vote today

00:32.758 --> 00:35.759
out of respect
for the pygmy tarsier.

00:38.864 --> 00:41.298
Decades ago, these
large-eyed mammals traveled

00:41.300 --> 00:42.766
in monogamous pairs,

00:42.768 --> 00:44.768
happily leaping
from branch to branch

00:44.770 --> 00:47.704
around this beautiful,
unspoiled island.

00:49.675 --> 00:53.443
Then suddenly they disappeared,
thought to be extinct,

00:53.445 --> 00:56.446
until last year, when
a teeny-weeny pair was found

00:56.448 --> 00:58.415
by scientists.

00:58.417 --> 01:01.018
But now, sadly,
just one remains

01:01.020 --> 01:06.056
one single pygmy tarsier
is all alone in this world.

01:06.058 --> 01:08.992
Because you,
Madi Cooke of Connecticut,

01:08.994 --> 01:11.061
killed the only other
in existence.

01:20.739 --> 01:23.674
I thought it was a hairy spider.
You are gritless.

01:23.676 --> 01:25.876
It was dark. I felt something
crawl on me.

01:25.878 --> 01:28.612
Be gone, Madi Cooke. Be gone.

01:28.614 --> 01:31.014
Okay, just...

01:31.016 --> 01:34.384
Yes, put out the tarsier's
teeny-tiny torch

01:34.386 --> 01:35.886
and be gone.

01:35.888 --> 01:38.488
It's just a birthday candle.
Be gone, Madi Cooke.

01:38.490 --> 01:40.524
Okay.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.960
<i>Gritless, gritless...</i>

01:43.962 --> 01:47.030
Be gone, Madi Cooke. Be gone.

01:47.032 --> 01:51.435
<i>Gritless, gritless, gritless,
gritless, gritless, gritless...</i>

02:03.449 --> 02:05.582
<i>Tomorrow,
a new challenge awaits.</i>

02:05.584 --> 02:08.585
<i>Okay.</i>

02:11.724 --> 02:15.559
<i>Madi, are you there?
Are you there?</i>

02:15.561 --> 02:17.761
<i>She's not answering.</i>

02:19.965 --> 02:23.867
<i>Madi, are you there?
We saw you on the television.</i>

02:23.869 --> 02:25.736
<i>You looked thin.</i>

02:25.738 --> 02:28.071
<i>Why was he mean to you?
You killed something?</i>

02:28.073 --> 02:30.073
<i>Professional!</i>

02:30.075 --> 02:32.776
<i>Your father wants to know
if that was part of the game.</i>

02:32.778 --> 02:35.412
<i>Sold! Sold! Sold!</i>

02:35.414 --> 02:40.150
<i>I'm Bobbi Mason, and I always
beat the competition.</i>

02:41.687 --> 02:44.154
<i>Winner!</i>

02:44.156 --> 02:45.889
<i>Buyers and sellers,
call Mason Agents,</i>

02:45.891 --> 02:47.124
<i>where everyone's a winner.</i>

02:47.126 --> 02:48.959
<i>Madi, are you there?</i>

02:48.961 --> 02:51.828
<i>Well, how should I know
where she goes?</i>

03:01.874 --> 03:04.007
<i>Gritless, gritless, gritless...</i>

03:05.077 --> 03:07.043
Oh, shit.

03:18.624 --> 03:20.624
<i>No Place Like Home,
this is Dorothy speaking.</i>

03:20.626 --> 03:23.860
Alex, I can see you.
<i>Nuh-uh. This is Dorothy.</i>

03:23.862 --> 03:26.797
<i>No one named Alex works here
or knows Madi Cooke.</i>

03:26.799 --> 03:28.799
Please tell Risa
I'm gonna be late.

03:28.801 --> 03:31.902
<i>No. You're a murderer. She
doesn't wanna hear from you.</i>

03:31.904 --> 03:34.571
I'm not a murderer, Alex.
<i>You are.</i>

03:34.573 --> 03:37.908
<i>You're an ecoterrorist.</i>
Tell Risa I'm gonna be late.

03:37.910 --> 03:40.844
You have no idea
what's going on here.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.712
<i>You should see
what's going on here.</i>

03:42.714 --> 03:44.481
<i>There's a news van out front.</i>
What?

03:44.483 --> 03:46.216
<i>Risa said you're not
welcome here.</i>

03:46.218 --> 03:48.118
<i>Except she said it all mean</i>

03:48.120 --> 03:51.121
<i>and with lots of curse words.</i>
No, she can't fire me.

03:51.123 --> 03:53.457
It was an accident.

03:53.459 --> 03:56.159
Tell her I have six listings.
<i>No, you don't.</i>

03:56.161 --> 03:58.495
No, I have a showing
coming up later today.

03:58.497 --> 04:02.232
I am coming in.
<i>I got a showing today too.</i>

04:02.234 --> 04:06.069
<i>Gritless!
Gritless! Gritless! Gritless!</i>

04:09.575 --> 04:11.508
- <i>Gritless! Gritless!</i>
- There she is!

04:11.510 --> 04:13.243
Madi, hi...

04:13.245 --> 04:17.214
Please leave. Sorry. I'm really
sorry about everything.

04:17.216 --> 04:20.050
I promise you, I really
thought it was a spider.

04:20.052 --> 04:22.017
You would have done it too.

04:22.019 --> 04:25.655
It's not as cute in person.
It's really scary. Okay.

04:25.657 --> 04:26.923
Madi?

04:32.264 --> 04:34.030
<i>Kylie Jenner speaking.</i>

04:34.032 --> 04:36.500
Alex! Alex! Please tell Risa

04:36.502 --> 04:38.702
she needs to cover
my showing, okay?

04:38.704 --> 04:40.904
I can't move my car.

04:40.906 --> 04:45.909
Uh, this is the cops, okay?
I'm calling the cops.

04:47.846 --> 04:53.717
Listen, I will not hesitate
to use this if I have to!

04:53.719 --> 04:55.952
It was an accident, I told you.

05:05.564 --> 05:06.897
Whoa!

05:06.899 --> 05:08.865
Oh, shit!

05:08.867 --> 05:12.068
Are you okay?
You're so mean.

05:12.070 --> 05:15.572
No, I'm not.
Yes. Everyone says so.

05:15.574 --> 05:19.042
Who are you supposed to be,
a pygmy tarsier?

05:19.044 --> 05:20.810
You gonna hit me with
that racquet?

05:20.812 --> 05:22.612
No. Okay?

05:22.614 --> 05:25.715
Anyway, you look more like
that creature from that movie.

05:25.717 --> 05:27.951
<i>Gremlins!</i>
My boss loves that movie.

05:27.953 --> 05:30.153
He makes me wear this
when I hand out fliers.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.622
Where do you work?
I work for wise Mr. Lee

05:32.624 --> 05:34.991
at the New Vintage Antiques
and Candy Shop,

05:34.993 --> 05:36.726
but please don't call him.

05:36.728 --> 05:38.194
Ugh, it's very expensive.

05:38.196 --> 05:40.730
I'm not supposed
to get it dirty. My eye!

05:40.732 --> 05:43.667
Ugh! My eye!
I think...

05:43.669 --> 05:47.003
I think I may be able
to get it fixed for you.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.950
Can you just...?

05:59.952 --> 06:02.619
Why is nobody
answering their phone?

06:09.227 --> 06:10.794
Come on, come on, come on.

06:10.796 --> 06:12.596
How's it going?
You didn't text me.

06:12.598 --> 06:13.830
I couldn't.
My phone's out there.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.632
Mine is too.
Sorry, Kelly.

06:15.634 --> 06:16.967
They're at deuce now.

06:16.969 --> 06:18.835
Okay.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.770
Oh!
Never mind. It's ad out.

06:20.772 --> 06:23.673
Bobbi and Rosey are
about to win.

06:31.149 --> 06:32.749
Sorry.

06:32.751 --> 06:34.384
She's trying
to get in Bobbi's head.

06:34.386 --> 06:36.319
Nothing can get in there.

06:41.293 --> 06:42.692
Agh! Bounce it!

06:42.694 --> 06:44.060
- Out!
- What?

06:44.062 --> 06:45.996
She's calling it out?

06:45.998 --> 06:50.333
How? That clearly hit the line.
I saw it from here.

06:50.335 --> 06:53.136
We all did. Right, ladies?

06:53.138 --> 06:54.738
We win. Oh--

06:54.740 --> 06:56.206
Goddamn it, Rosey!

06:56.208 --> 06:58.174
I'm telling you, Emily.
It was in.

06:58.176 --> 07:02.045
It's out. It's my call.
I'm right here. You're not.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.813
Deuce.
No deuce.

07:03.815 --> 07:07.217
That was perfect play. We won!
You want some proof?

07:07.219 --> 07:10.153
Let's check the phones.
That is not a thing.

07:10.155 --> 07:12.389
You're not supposed to have
phones out here.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.057
Oh, shush, Sheila.

07:15.694 --> 07:17.394
Check it!

07:17.396 --> 07:18.395
That's you.
Oh, it's mine!

07:18.397 --> 07:20.430
Go! Go!
Check it!

07:33.011 --> 07:35.078
Hi. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.213
I am the gremlin.

07:59.037 --> 08:00.370
Sorry. Can we--? can we go?

08:00.372 --> 08:02.872
I really need
to get to my office.

08:02.874 --> 08:04.374
I know who you are.

08:04.376 --> 08:07.143
You're the killer
of that cute little rodent.

08:07.145 --> 08:11.214
My daughter likes tiny things.
She cried all night.

08:11.216 --> 08:14.918
Get out of my car, miss.
Get out!

08:14.920 --> 08:18.855
Can we please...?
I said get out.

08:21.393 --> 08:22.992
Fine!

08:22.994 --> 08:24.494
Goddamn it!

08:28.900 --> 08:33.870
You're gritless! That's what
they called you, gritless.

08:42.179 --> 08:45.081
Oh, Philip, hey!
God, you look good.

08:45.083 --> 08:47.250
How you doing, Bobbi?
Well, I've been better.

08:47.252 --> 08:50.186
The thing is, Philip, you gotta
invest in an Eagle Eye.

08:50.188 --> 08:52.388
Why? Did you lose?

08:52.390 --> 08:55.191
Did I lose?
No, you Ding Dong.

08:55.193 --> 08:57.227
The only player
who can beat me is me.

08:57.229 --> 08:59.195
I'm still looking
for my perfect match.

08:59.197 --> 09:02.165
Heh. Hey, did you
set up those phones?

09:02.167 --> 09:04.134
I'm getting complaints
from other teams.

09:04.136 --> 09:07.103
Well, I have no other choice.
They're cheating, so...

09:07.105 --> 09:10.473
But, oh, if we had an Eagle Eye,
then they couldn't cheat,

09:10.475 --> 09:12.509
and no one would have
reason to complain.

09:12.511 --> 09:16.446
Yeah. The thing is, Bobbi,
uh, this isn't Wimbledon.

09:16.448 --> 09:18.348
Well...
You really don't need it

09:18.350 --> 09:20.450
for the Dick Duncan Tournament.
Okay.

09:20.452 --> 09:23.386
Let's not diss Dick Duncan.
I cherish it. You know that.

09:23.388 --> 09:25.855
The Eagle Eye
is cost prohibitive, Bobbi.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.524
Okay.
Because to do it right,

09:27.526 --> 09:29.492
you need eight cameras

09:29.494 --> 09:31.528
strategically placed
around the courts,

09:31.530 --> 09:34.464
and all those cameras are linked
to a computer system

09:34.466 --> 09:36.800
that reads
all those camera views

09:36.802 --> 09:38.468
and spits out
the path of the ball.

09:38.470 --> 09:41.337
And that's just one court.
And we've got 20-something.

09:41.339 --> 09:44.574
Mm-hm.
So you've thought about it.

09:44.576 --> 09:46.876
No.
Yes, you have.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.211
Ha, don't lie to me.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.146
And it doesn't
have to be every court.

09:50.148 --> 09:53.249
Just my court, court number one.

09:53.251 --> 09:55.051
You're a smart guy, P.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.420
I don't have to remind you
that Mason Agent sponsors,

09:57.422 --> 09:59.856
gosh, what is it now,
is it six leagues here?

09:59.858 --> 10:01.257
Six. It's six.

10:01.259 --> 10:03.359
Not to mention
all the new residents

10:03.361 --> 10:06.095
that I send skipping your way.

10:06.097 --> 10:08.865
So you promise me an Eagle Eye,

10:08.867 --> 10:10.533
and maybe I'll stop
with the phones.

10:14.105 --> 10:18.041
Good to see you, Bobbi.
Oh, always just the best.

10:18.043 --> 10:19.976
The best of the best.

10:19.978 --> 10:22.145
You are.
No, you are.

10:22.147 --> 10:24.948
Ha, I know!

10:24.950 --> 10:27.116
Ciao! Ciao!
Have fun out there.

10:27.118 --> 10:29.419
Fuck my life.

11:04.489 --> 11:07.257
Hey, lady,
why are you dressed like that?

11:07.259 --> 11:10.260
Were you at a party
or something?

11:10.262 --> 11:11.361
No.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.433
Hey, lady, why does
your face look like that?

11:19.304 --> 11:21.571
Why aren't you in school
learning your manners?

11:21.573 --> 11:23.206
Why aren't you at work?

11:23.208 --> 11:24.908
Why are you a stupid dummy?

11:24.910 --> 11:27.110
Why are you a stupid bitch?

11:27.112 --> 11:29.345
Mikey!

11:29.347 --> 11:32.448
Oh, Baby Mikey,
your mommy's calling.

11:32.450 --> 11:35.151
It's time for you to go home
and take a little nappy.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.153
That's not my mom.
That's Delphine.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.622
And she's like 19
and hotter than you.

11:39.624 --> 11:41.524
I feel sorry for your mother.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.660
I feel sorry for <i> your</i> mother

11:43.662 --> 11:46.696
and your stupid
<i>Gremlin</i> babies.

11:46.698 --> 11:48.164
Mikey!

11:51.436 --> 11:55.571
Well, ha!
'Cause I don't have any babies!

11:55.573 --> 11:59.275
In fact, I don't really have
any responsibilities!

11:59.277 --> 12:02.011
I don't even have a job anymore!

12:03.581 --> 12:06.716
You're gonna have a ton
of responsibilities one day,

12:06.718 --> 12:11.187
and I feel so sorry for you
because it sucks!

12:45.557 --> 12:47.056
Mom?

12:48.460 --> 12:51.060
Could you do
something to my hair?

12:53.565 --> 12:57.133
Thanks.
And can you also pick me up?

12:57.135 --> 12:59.369
Not too short.

12:59.371 --> 13:01.537
I used to cut your bangs.
Remember?

13:01.539 --> 13:04.040
You hated it
when I combed your wet hair.

13:04.042 --> 13:06.743
Yeah. Because it used to hurt.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.278
It does right now. Ow! Mom!

13:09.280 --> 13:12.181
I'm sorry. You're so sensitive.
Ow!

13:17.255 --> 13:19.155
Where's Dad?

13:19.157 --> 13:21.057
Oh, he's... He's in the car.

13:21.059 --> 13:25.161
Now, he's not gonna leave with
all those protesters out there.

13:25.163 --> 13:27.296
So sorry.
Don't be.

13:27.298 --> 13:29.399
Your father will talk to them.

13:32.804 --> 13:35.204
And I'm worried, Madi.

13:36.741 --> 13:40.076
You know, they have
medicine for depression.

13:40.078 --> 13:41.778
Mom, no.
Everyone's on it.

13:41.780 --> 13:45.114
No. No. I am the most hated
woman on the planet right now,

13:45.116 --> 13:48.284
I lost my job, and I'm
a prisoner in my own home.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.253
I don't think
a pill can fix that.

13:50.255 --> 13:52.588
And you haven't had
a boyfriend since Steven.

13:52.590 --> 13:54.490
Oh, God.
You went on that show

13:54.492 --> 13:57.427
to build confidence.
Instead, look what happened.

13:57.429 --> 14:00.329
Hand me the round brush, okay?

14:01.533 --> 14:03.466
Ugh, you call this a brush?
Mom!

14:07.138 --> 14:09.338
Anyway, I'm thinking
of calling Ollie.

14:09.340 --> 14:10.773
She could always cheer you.

14:10.775 --> 14:13.376
No. What?

14:13.378 --> 14:16.245
What, nothing.

14:16.247 --> 14:20.750
Mom, No.
You are not calling Ollie. No.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.722
Now, I'm not finished.
But look how nice.

14:26.724 --> 14:29.192
I always loved you
with shorter hair.

14:29.194 --> 14:31.094
It gives you a lift.

14:32.530 --> 14:34.597
And so blond.

14:34.599 --> 14:37.767
Madi, you look
just like Doris Day.

15:00.458 --> 15:02.425
You're looking at my picture?

15:05.563 --> 15:06.829
It's me.
Oh.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.500
I was a very famous ball boy.

15:10.502 --> 15:11.767
Oh.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.238
The most famous ball boy
in the world.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.839
Oh, wow.

15:18.643 --> 15:22.378
But, you know,
the boy becomes the man,

15:22.380 --> 15:23.713
and balls don't follow.

15:25.850 --> 15:28.451
I'm sorry. What are you
here for? The interview?

15:28.453 --> 15:31.521
Yeah, yeah. Oh, this...

15:31.523 --> 15:33.589
This is
the real-estate office, right?

15:33.591 --> 15:37.760
Oh, boy.
You're gonna do just great.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.795
Just sign in right there.

15:39.797 --> 15:41.364
Oh, sure.

15:41.366 --> 15:45.368
Oh, heh-heh, funny.

15:45.370 --> 15:47.637
I mean, some people dedicate
their lives to it,

15:47.639 --> 15:50.473
but, sure, funny.

15:50.475 --> 15:55.311
Sure. Sorry. Of course. Just...

15:57.615 --> 15:59.382
You can just sit-- Sit there.

15:59.384 --> 16:00.850
Okay.

16:04.889 --> 16:06.689
I'll just...

16:10.428 --> 16:13.729
Mason Agents,
where everyone's a winner.

16:13.731 --> 16:15.865
That doesn't make any
sense, Rosey.

16:15.867 --> 16:19.936
Practice doesn't make perfect.
Perfect practice makes perfect.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.506
How are we, Ken?
Oh, well--

16:23.508 --> 16:26.709
Oh, ladies.
Thank you for coming in.

16:26.711 --> 16:30.446
If you've been here longer than
20 minutes, please do leave.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.748
You've lost the job
with your mind.

16:32.750 --> 16:36.252
You see, as the great
Dick Duncan once said

16:36.254 --> 16:38.321
to me in person, heh,

16:38.323 --> 16:40.423
your time is as important
as anyone else's,

16:40.425 --> 16:41.757
and you should know that.

16:45.230 --> 16:47.463
Good luck out there.
I appreciate you.

16:55.440 --> 17:00.443
I'm not leaving.
Um, they called me, so...

17:00.445 --> 17:03.946
Heh, well, I've only been here
for five minutes.

17:03.948 --> 17:06.015
Quiet, please. Quiet, please.

17:06.017 --> 17:08.951
Sorry.

17:15.627 --> 17:16.925
Get away from the car.

17:16.928 --> 17:18.661
Nym, that's no protester.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.530
That's Ollie.
I can't be sure.

17:21.531 --> 17:23.799
Look at her, for God's sakes.
It's Ollie. Let her in.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.434
I'm gonna get in.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.338
Hi.
Hi. You made it.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.340
Yes.
So glad to see you.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.376
You too.
Now I remember.

17:33.378 --> 17:35.278
You're the funny kid.
Mm.

17:35.280 --> 17:38.014
What happened to you?
You don't listen.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.516
She moved
to Los Angeles for work

17:40.518 --> 17:43.552
and for that boy Albert,

17:43.554 --> 17:46.289
and she's been there ever
since college. Right, Ollie?

17:46.291 --> 17:49.759
Mm-hm. Uh, this whole setup
feels very covert.

17:49.761 --> 17:51.460
What exactly are we doing?

17:51.462 --> 17:54.363
Well, I don't know
why we're still in the car.

17:54.365 --> 17:57.066
There's no more protesters, Nym.
Mm.

17:57.068 --> 17:59.935
This is very exciting.
Where is Madi?

17:59.937 --> 18:02.738
She's not even home.
Oh.

18:02.740 --> 18:06.375
Oh, how are your parents?
They are thriving

18:06.377 --> 18:08.978
at an active older adult
community in North Carolina.

18:08.980 --> 18:10.546
Oh.
Thank you.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.082
And that boy, Albert?

18:14.752 --> 18:18.421
He is horrible and disgusting.

18:18.423 --> 18:20.589
Stupid fucker!

18:21.993 --> 18:23.793
Kind of weird to be
in the back seat

18:23.795 --> 18:26.462
of my best friend's
parents' car

18:26.464 --> 18:29.632
20 years after high school.
Hm.

18:29.634 --> 18:31.567
New car,
but it still smells the same.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.470
Good job, Mr. Cooke.
Thank you.

18:34.472 --> 18:37.673
Rosey, are we all set?
Yes.

18:37.675 --> 18:39.375
Me don't think so.

18:39.377 --> 18:41.377
The chair, Rosey. The chair.

18:41.379 --> 18:43.112
Sorry. Sorry.
Your favorite power play.

18:43.114 --> 18:44.880
Yes. Every time.

18:44.882 --> 18:48.551
She's coming. Quick, quick!
Hurry! Come on! Move!

18:48.553 --> 18:50.986
Oh, ha! Oh, would you look
at that,

18:50.988 --> 18:52.922
I just sold the Martin house.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.957
Stop! Stop!

18:54.959 --> 18:57.360
But that was quick,
even for me.

18:57.362 --> 18:58.861
Hi. Résumé?

18:58.863 --> 19:00.596
Yeah. Of course. Yeah.

19:00.598 --> 19:04.066
Well, median prices are
finally inching up.

19:04.068 --> 19:05.868
Median prices?

19:05.870 --> 19:08.571
Okay. You can sit.

19:10.007 --> 19:12.508
Heh, Rosey,
why doesn't anyone

19:12.510 --> 19:14.777
ever just grab the damn chair?

19:14.779 --> 19:16.946
I don't know, Bobbi.
Put it front of my desk,

19:16.948 --> 19:19.014
and take control
of the situation.

19:19.016 --> 19:21.751
It's okay. You're dismissed.
No!

19:21.753 --> 19:25.454
No, I was about to.
I was just...

19:25.456 --> 19:27.857
mesmerized by your trophies.

19:27.859 --> 19:29.992
Oh, what these?
My Double Ds? Yeah.

19:29.994 --> 19:32.962
They're impossible to ignore.
Do you play?

19:32.964 --> 19:35.398
Do I play?
That's what I just asked, yeah.

19:35.400 --> 19:39.969
Well, let's just say it's how
I prepared for this interview.

19:39.971 --> 19:46.108
Hm. That's almost interesting.
Expand.

19:46.110 --> 19:49.645
Well, uh... I'm a bit nervous.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.447
But in a good way.

19:51.449 --> 19:54.750
Like, um, ahem,
when you're playing

19:54.752 --> 19:56.519
and suddenly
you're at match point

19:56.521 --> 20:00.022
and you can just feel the win.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.624
Mm.

20:01.626 --> 20:04.727
But you don't wanna
get ahead of yourself.

20:04.729 --> 20:08.998
Rosey, get the chair
for Madi, um...

20:09.000 --> 20:10.599
Whoops.

20:10.601 --> 20:12.968
You forgot to put your last name
on your résumé.

20:12.970 --> 20:14.637
Oh, ha!

20:14.639 --> 20:16.939
I never put my last name

20:16.941 --> 20:20.643
on my résumé
for security reasons.

20:20.645 --> 20:23.712
The dark web?
Shh. Say no more. I get it.

20:23.714 --> 20:26.048
But I'll need your last name
if you wanna work for me.

20:26.050 --> 20:29.752
Sure. Yeah.
It's Sharapova...

20:29.754 --> 20:32.721
klavacki.

20:32.723 --> 20:35.558
Sharapovaklavacki.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.093
Sharapovaklavacki.

20:38.095 --> 20:40.229
With a C and a K?
Yeah.

20:40.231 --> 20:42.231
Huh. That's beautiful.

20:43.935 --> 20:46.001
Yeah. I got it. I got it.
Thanks.

20:46.003 --> 20:49.104
All right,
Madi Sharapovaklavacki,

20:49.106 --> 20:50.973
continue with your story.

20:50.975 --> 20:54.477
I'm at match point,
and I'm about to win. Go.

20:54.479 --> 20:56.812
Oh, sure. So, uh, okay.
You're about to serve.

20:56.814 --> 21:00.182
Mm.
Um, but you take a beat.

21:00.184 --> 21:02.051
Maybe you look at your strings.

21:02.053 --> 21:03.819
Yeah. Maybe I do.

21:03.821 --> 21:08.724
Breathe in. Breathe out.

21:08.726 --> 21:11.827
Breathe in. Breathe out.

21:11.829 --> 21:13.729
Breathe in...

21:13.731 --> 21:15.764
And then I'm ready.

21:15.766 --> 21:19.235
Ooh, I've done this
a million times.

21:19.237 --> 21:21.170
Ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum.

21:21.172 --> 21:23.038
That's the ball.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.040
My toss is perfect.
Heh, what's new?

21:25.042 --> 21:27.910
I feel the strength ripple
through my legs into my core.

21:27.912 --> 21:30.012
And Boom! Woof!
Daddy, it's in my arms!

21:30.014 --> 21:31.647
And then what happens?

21:31.649 --> 21:33.148
Come on, Madi Sharapovaklavacki!

21:33.150 --> 21:35.217
Uh, but, oh, no! Oh, no!
It's your second serve.

21:35.219 --> 21:37.119
I should play it carefully.
Why chance it?

21:37.121 --> 21:38.721
I don't know.
But then...

21:38.723 --> 21:40.055
something comes over you.

21:40.057 --> 21:41.790
Yeah, it does,

21:41.792 --> 21:43.893
and I smack it hard. Smack!

21:43.895 --> 21:45.694
But the bitch gets to it!
Fuck!

21:45.696 --> 21:47.830
But it's a wimpy,
off-balance overhead.

21:47.832 --> 21:51.100
Ha-ha-ha-ha! It's the shot
I've been fucking waiting for!

21:51.102 --> 21:53.802
I'm gonna come down on it
like it's a menacing big...

21:53.804 --> 21:54.970
Spider.
Spider.

21:54.972 --> 21:56.705
Penis! Spider penis.

21:56.707 --> 21:58.040
What?
What?

21:58.042 --> 21:59.942
Rosey?
Oh, the baby's coming.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.044
No! No! Stop! Stop it!

22:02.046 --> 22:04.179
I thought I could hold it.
I'm so sorry.

22:04.181 --> 22:06.015
I thought I could hold it in--
Don't be sorry.

22:06.017 --> 22:08.083
We're just gonna
take a deep breath

22:08.085 --> 22:10.052
and wait until
the tournament is over.

22:10.054 --> 22:12.054
You're my partner.
You're gonna have to.

22:12.056 --> 22:14.189
I can't do it.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I love it.

22:14.191 --> 22:17.293
Thank you so much for
being my sidekick. I love it.

22:17.295 --> 22:19.094
Maybe she can be your partner.
Hm?

22:19.096 --> 22:21.664
Look at her. She's not
even a little pregnant.

22:21.666 --> 22:23.198
Yeah, I'm-- I'm not.
Okay. Shush!

22:23.200 --> 22:25.067
Let me-- Let me think. Whoo.

22:27.204 --> 22:30.606
Eye of the tiger.

22:30.608 --> 22:32.041
Okay. Sure.

22:32.043 --> 22:34.977
Saturday, 12:30 doubles.
We play at Elite.

22:37.014 --> 22:39.281
Does that mean I get the job?

22:39.283 --> 22:43.786
Well, that depends, Madi.
If we win, maybe.

22:43.788 --> 22:46.622
If we lose, no way, Jose.

22:46.624 --> 22:48.724
Thank you for coming in.

22:48.726 --> 22:53.729
Um, should we call someone?
Oh, great idea.

22:53.731 --> 22:58.033
Rosey, can you make sure that
we reserve a court? Thank you.

22:58.035 --> 23:01.170
Uh, what time?
She's so stupid.

23:01.172 --> 23:04.707
12:30, like every Saturday.

23:04.709 --> 23:08.911
Okay. The door is that way, Madi
Sharapovaklavacki. Thank you.

23:08.913 --> 23:10.346
Congratulations.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.348
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

23:36.774 --> 23:39.942
Hi. I'd like to take a lesson.

23:39.944 --> 23:41.777
So?
What?

23:41.779 --> 23:44.246
Pro?

23:44.248 --> 23:46.015
Oh. Heh.

23:47.818 --> 23:50.853
Um, yeah, I'm pretty good.

23:50.855 --> 23:52.955
Actually, I haven't played
in a long time.

23:52.957 --> 23:55.691
I-- I'd love to practice.

23:55.693 --> 23:57.760
I'm sure I don't know
anyone here anymore.

23:57.762 --> 24:00.329
Name?
It's been for a long time. Madi.

24:00.331 --> 24:02.097
My name is Madi.

24:02.099 --> 24:05.768
Uh, is anyone available
maybe for a private or...?

24:05.770 --> 24:07.102
No.

24:07.104 --> 24:09.672
We run clinics today.
Oh.

24:09.674 --> 24:12.841
Fernando, any room
in your clinic for Madi?

24:15.946 --> 24:18.247
He says it's fine.

24:18.249 --> 24:21.116
You can play with him today
and see how it goes.

24:21.118 --> 24:24.086
That'll be $45.00.
Oh, okay.

24:24.088 --> 24:25.721
Cash.

24:26.791 --> 24:30.225
I'm sorry?
Cash. Shh...

24:30.227 --> 24:31.960
Oh.

24:33.064 --> 24:35.130
Shh, okay.

24:40.004 --> 24:42.204
Shh.

24:42.206 --> 24:44.473
How you doing?
Uh, come with me. We'll...

24:44.475 --> 24:47.076
We'll heat ourselves up
without them.

24:48.779 --> 24:50.879
Court six. The last one.

24:53.451 --> 24:56.018
Serena Williams, totally.

24:56.020 --> 24:58.821
You don't understand
the question.

24:58.823 --> 25:00.089
How about del Potro?

25:00.091 --> 25:02.291
Ooh! He looks like
a very good lover.

25:02.293 --> 25:03.792
Mm-hm.
A Latin lover.

25:03.794 --> 25:04.860
Oh!

25:04.862 --> 25:06.261
Novak.
Mm, too boring.

25:07.298 --> 25:08.964
He's not boring.
Hm.

25:08.966 --> 25:10.466
He's a quiet genius.

25:10.468 --> 25:14.036
He's methodical, professional
and secretly funny.

25:14.038 --> 25:15.904
I bet Serena could
kick his ass.

25:15.906 --> 25:17.005
Mm-hm.

25:23.214 --> 25:25.481
Ha! Ha! Ha!

25:25.483 --> 25:27.182
No, that was good.

25:27.184 --> 25:30.352
No, that was...
Um, that was pretty good.

25:30.354 --> 25:32.321
Who's that?
Thirty-love.

25:32.323 --> 25:35.324
She's beating Fernando
30-l'oeuf.

25:35.326 --> 25:38.794
No. That's okay. It's okay.
It's enough. That's enough.

25:38.796 --> 25:42.965
Hey. Hey. Hi, girls.
I want you to meet Madi.

25:42.967 --> 25:48.137
She's going to be joining
the clinic for today, because...

25:48.139 --> 25:51.907
Because she needs practice.
Okay. Baseline.

25:51.909 --> 25:53.976
Ah! It's a brand-new day.

25:55.513 --> 25:59.281
Good. Okay. You keep your eyes
on the balls, CeeCee.

26:00.918 --> 26:04.453
Don't worry about it.
Get it again. Get it again.

26:04.455 --> 26:06.922
I know! I know!

26:06.924 --> 26:09.258
- I had book club last night.
- Here we go.

26:13.798 --> 26:15.097
<i>Vamos,</i> very good.

26:15.099 --> 26:17.266
Valentina Gasolina.

26:17.268 --> 26:20.169
Bam, motherfucker! Ha!

26:20.171 --> 26:22.171
Good. Valentina, Madi,
go to the net.

26:22.173 --> 26:25.340
Two volleys each. Okay.
<i>Vamos.</i> Here we go.

26:25.342 --> 26:27.576
Wap! Good. Good.

26:27.578 --> 26:29.378
Wap! Good!

26:29.380 --> 26:31.880
Follow through
powerful to the net.

26:35.052 --> 26:37.119
Good. Very aggressive. Next?

26:37.121 --> 26:39.855
Okay. Okay. CeeCee.
<i>Vamos.</i> Loosen.

26:39.857 --> 26:42.291
Okay. Here we go.
Move your feet, CeeCee.

26:42.293 --> 26:44.593
Pop! Move your feet, CeeCee.
Move your feet.

26:44.595 --> 26:47.496
Wap! Change your grip, CeeCee.

26:47.498 --> 26:49.898
No. Come to the net,
<i>mi amor.</i> Come to the net.

26:49.900 --> 26:53.435
Let me see you grip.
Show me your grip.

26:55.406 --> 26:59.308
Hammer. Hammer grip.
Okay? Hammer. Hammer.

26:59.310 --> 27:02.477
Where are you?
At Acme Indoor Tennis.

27:03.948 --> 27:06.181
Where are you?

27:06.183 --> 27:08.383
Next to Preeti.
You're at the net.

27:08.385 --> 27:10.285
So show me your grip.

27:10.287 --> 27:13.088
No! No, baby.
That's not right still.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.157
In volley, elbow to the front.
Okay?

27:15.159 --> 27:16.425
You step, wap!

27:16.427 --> 27:19.061
Stop picking on me.
I can't focus.

27:19.063 --> 27:20.629
There's so many things
to remember,

27:20.631 --> 27:23.465
and the ball comes so fast.
Okay. I'm ready.

27:27.972 --> 27:30.138
Sorry. Excuse me, sir.
Thank you.

27:34.545 --> 27:36.511
Looking good. Feeling good.

27:36.513 --> 27:38.313
Call Philip.

27:38.315 --> 27:40.883
Philip. Hi.
Just checking in.

27:40.885 --> 27:43.485
Where do we stand
on installing that Eagle Eye?

27:43.487 --> 27:46.321
I'm very excited.
No. I hate those.

27:46.323 --> 27:48.557
But this is the last style
we have in stock.

27:48.559 --> 27:51.260
You could go to the website.
Uh... Philip, hold on.

27:51.262 --> 27:54.029
I'm so sorry. Wait one second.
I have a situation.

27:54.031 --> 27:57.332
Excuse me?
You think I have time

27:57.334 --> 28:00.535
to wait for tennis sneakers to
arrive in the mail, try them on

28:00.537 --> 28:02.437
and send them back
over and over again

28:02.439 --> 28:05.374
until I find
the right exact pair?

28:05.376 --> 28:07.442
No, I don't think you do.

28:07.444 --> 28:09.044
What?
No.

28:09.046 --> 28:12.180
No. That's right.
I don't, Derek.

28:12.182 --> 28:14.583
So let's find
the right pair right now.

28:14.585 --> 28:16.285
Shall we?
Okay.

28:16.287 --> 28:19.421
Great. Let's go.

28:19.423 --> 28:21.657
Philip, I'm back. I'm so sorry.

28:21.659 --> 28:25.227
No, no. Listen, I will help with
the financing. Just get it done.

28:25.229 --> 28:28.430
Call me when you get this
message. It's Bobbi. Thanks.

28:38.943 --> 28:41.043
Wait. Did you leave?

28:56.994 --> 28:58.427
I hate tennis.

28:58.429 --> 28:59.528
What's the matter
with you today?

28:59.530 --> 29:01.396
I never get better. I hate it.

29:01.398 --> 29:02.965
We all have our off days.

29:02.967 --> 29:06.034
No. It's not that.
I can't focus.

29:06.036 --> 29:08.236
Too much on your mind.
I have nothing on my mind.

29:08.238 --> 29:09.638
This morning, I searched

29:09.640 --> 29:11.673
how to clean calcium
off of shower heads.

29:11.675 --> 29:13.375
Then suddenly I'm looking at

29:13.377 --> 29:15.610
top 10 celebrity
plastic surgeries gone wrong,

29:15.612 --> 29:18.313
which led to child TV stars
then and now.

29:18.315 --> 29:20.215
And, yes, there is crossover.

29:20.217 --> 29:22.017
And I still don't know
the best way

29:22.019 --> 29:23.752
to clean calcium
off shower heads.

29:23.754 --> 29:25.354
Here, take one.

29:25.356 --> 29:27.356
What is it?
It's vinegar.

29:27.358 --> 29:29.691
It's always vinegar.
It'll help you focus.

29:29.693 --> 29:31.493
Try it next time.
Valentina, tell me

29:31.495 --> 29:33.362
you are not stealing
your son's medication.

29:33.364 --> 29:36.164
Like I'm the first parent
to take their kid's ADD meds.

29:36.166 --> 29:37.332
Don't take it.

29:37.334 --> 29:40.535
Hey, you guys, sorry.

29:40.537 --> 29:44.172
Would you mind
if I joined your clinic...

29:44.174 --> 29:46.074
more permanently?

29:48.012 --> 29:50.445
I guess we could use a blond.

29:50.447 --> 29:52.781
A real blond.

29:52.783 --> 29:56.284
Wait. What the hell
were we just talking about?

30:38.762 --> 30:41.096
<i>If we win, maybe.</i>

30:41.098 --> 30:44.232
<i>But if we lose,
no way, Jose.</i>

30:48.439 --> 30:51.173
Sweet Jesus. What is this?

30:51.175 --> 30:53.108
- What's what?
- This.

30:53.110 --> 30:56.745
If you're gonna play like a pro,
you need to dress like a pro.

30:56.747 --> 31:00.382
See this? Soak it in.

31:00.384 --> 31:03.585
Stand up. You're making me
uncomfortable.

31:03.587 --> 31:06.354
Oh, uh, ahem, I...
I can move in this.

31:06.356 --> 31:08.423
Okay.

31:08.425 --> 31:10.325
Ugh, no. Ew! I hated that.

31:10.327 --> 31:12.294
Hey!
Hated. Hi!

31:12.296 --> 31:15.130
Oh, I'm so excited
to play with you guys today.

31:15.132 --> 31:18.100
You both look great. See?

31:18.102 --> 31:20.836
Oh, Mary Beth, L-O-V-E the bag.

31:20.838 --> 31:22.637
Oh, thank you.

31:22.639 --> 31:25.640
I love your tennies.
They're so cute.

31:25.642 --> 31:29.211
They are.
Is that racquet vintage?

31:29.213 --> 31:32.114
Oh, yeah, yeah. Ha.
I've had it since high school.

31:33.484 --> 31:35.517
This is Madi.
She's subbing for Rosey

31:35.519 --> 31:37.385
and playing for a shot
at being part

31:37.387 --> 31:39.287
of the Mason Agent family.

31:39.289 --> 31:41.790
This is Mary Beth and Grace,
two of my finest agents.

31:41.792 --> 31:43.492
Nice to meet you.

31:45.295 --> 31:46.895
Oh, a curtsy.

31:46.897 --> 31:49.664
Okay. So, ladies,
this is the first time

31:49.666 --> 31:51.900
Madi and I are
playing together, so...

31:51.902 --> 31:54.803
Oh, I haven't played
in like five days, so just--

31:54.805 --> 31:57.506
Well, I haven't played
in like six days.

31:57.508 --> 31:59.641
Super. So it's just gonna be
a fun one, then.

31:59.643 --> 32:02.611
Yeah. It'll just be fun.
Um, up or down?

32:02.613 --> 32:04.546
Oh, doesn't matter. Up.

32:06.483 --> 32:08.617
Down.

32:08.619 --> 32:10.285
I guess we'll serve first.
Mm-hm.

32:10.287 --> 32:11.786
First one in?
Love!

32:11.788 --> 32:13.788
Great.
Okay. Have fun out there.

32:13.790 --> 32:15.390
Thanks!

32:16.927 --> 32:18.627
First one in is for pussies.

32:18.629 --> 32:20.862
Now, listen up.
Grace is a slut for the alley.

32:20.864 --> 32:23.465
You need to cover it.
And Mary Beth loves to poach,

32:23.467 --> 32:25.767
so you gotta smack that ball
right at her face.

32:25.769 --> 32:26.902
Understood?
Yeah.

32:26.904 --> 32:28.637
Okay. Oh, forehand or backhand?

32:28.639 --> 32:32.574
Nah, never mind.
My forehand is freaky strong.

32:40.484 --> 32:42.250
Come on, Grace!

32:42.252 --> 32:43.919
Come on, Grace.

32:43.921 --> 32:46.354
Come on! Come on! And...

32:46.356 --> 32:48.423
- Dang!
- Not bad.

32:48.425 --> 32:50.492
But, uh, remember your alley.

32:59.369 --> 33:00.869
Mine.

33:14.851 --> 33:17.452
That was yours.
That was yours.

33:17.454 --> 33:19.287
That was your ball.
It was so yours.

33:20.824 --> 33:22.557
You seem to play well.

33:22.559 --> 33:24.626
Usually it takes a game
or two to warm up.

33:24.628 --> 33:25.927
That could be the difference

33:25.929 --> 33:28.263
between winning
and losing, couldn't it?

33:28.265 --> 33:30.932
Anything over here is yours.
Don't--

33:30.934 --> 33:34.269
Do you hear her meowing?

33:34.271 --> 33:35.403
Hm?

33:39.710 --> 33:40.942
Didn't hear the score.

33:40.944 --> 33:43.578
Oh, shit!
Grace, what's the score?

33:43.580 --> 33:47.415
I don't know. Say 30-40.

33:47.417 --> 33:49.251
Uh, 30-40.

33:49.253 --> 33:51.953
Can't be, Mary Beth.
Look where you're standing.

33:53.390 --> 33:56.391
Fifteen-40?
Okay. Heh.

33:56.393 --> 33:57.959
Ding-a-lings.
We've almost got 'em.

33:57.961 --> 33:59.027
Remember your alley.

34:02.666 --> 34:03.898
Mine!

34:05.602 --> 34:06.801
Alley, Madi!

34:08.871 --> 34:10.871
Grace, that was yours.
So yours.

34:10.873 --> 34:13.440
No, that was clearly yours.
Yours.

34:13.443 --> 34:14.976
- Yes!
- Nice match.

34:14.978 --> 34:17.445
Not too bad. But we could've
beaten them worse.

34:17.447 --> 34:20.348
Never let enough be good enough.
Are you serious?

34:20.350 --> 34:22.550
Eighty percent of balls
are hit to the center,

34:22.552 --> 34:24.619
so our odds were better
to play the middle

34:24.621 --> 34:26.288
even if we missed
a couple down the alley.

34:26.290 --> 34:28.523
If you missed a couple.
But potato "potato."

34:28.525 --> 34:30.391
I like your initiative.

34:30.393 --> 34:32.327
I need to get you
into a real match.

34:32.329 --> 34:34.663
And lucky for you, I will.

34:34.665 --> 34:36.398
Since Rosey still can't play.

34:36.400 --> 34:40.335
Yeah, but she...
She gave birth three days ago.

34:40.337 --> 34:42.337
Ugh, dude.
Don't even get me started.

34:42.339 --> 34:44.438
Of course I support
the Family Leave Act,

34:44.440 --> 34:46.308
but this is getting ridiculous.

34:46.310 --> 34:48.009
No matter. I have insisted

34:48.011 --> 34:50.612
that she comes
to the office to train you.

34:50.614 --> 34:52.981
That's right.
Welcome to the team.

34:52.983 --> 34:55.050
I'm gonna start you off
on the leads desk,

34:55.052 --> 34:56.885
and I want you to make me proud.

34:56.887 --> 35:00.322
As a wise man once told me...
Dick Duncan, in person.

35:00.324 --> 35:04.592
...winning is a habit,
success is a choice.

35:04.594 --> 35:06.394
You're welcome.

35:24.915 --> 35:27.549
Mason Agents.

35:27.551 --> 35:28.983
Where everyone's a winner!

35:30.420 --> 35:33.855
Yes. Mary Beth is here.
Please hold.

35:36.393 --> 35:38.026
Oh.

35:38.028 --> 35:40.495
Mason Agents,
where everyone's winner.

35:41.998 --> 35:44.599
Ashalee will be right with you.
Please hold.

35:44.601 --> 35:46.935
Oh, my gosh! Rosey, you didn't
have to come in.

35:46.937 --> 35:48.970
I'm doing so well.

35:48.972 --> 35:51.840
But, whoa! Let me see!

35:51.842 --> 35:55.110
Beautiful!
Did you choose a name yet?

35:55.112 --> 35:57.078
I name the baby.

35:57.080 --> 36:00.014
That was the deal. Right, Rosey?

36:00.016 --> 36:02.884
You give birth before
the Dick Duncan Tournament,

36:02.886 --> 36:05.720
and I get to name the baby.

36:05.722 --> 36:08.857
So I'm gonna. Um, ahem, ladies.

36:08.859 --> 36:11.493
Ladies, an announcement
to make.

36:11.495 --> 36:17.532
It is my great honor
and privilege to legally...

36:17.534 --> 36:20.835
Not legally, no.
...name this child...

36:20.837 --> 36:23.471
Bjِrn Borg.

36:23.473 --> 36:24.839
Hello.

36:24.841 --> 36:26.975
May he be...

36:26.977 --> 36:31.813
big, bold and brave,

36:31.815 --> 36:33.882
just like his mommy's boss.

36:33.884 --> 36:37.519
It's distinctive.
Yeah, well, he's a she, so...

36:37.521 --> 36:39.421
You don't need
a megaphone yet, Rosey.

36:39.423 --> 36:46.161
He can't talk. He can only stare
with his big, spooky eyes.

36:46.163 --> 36:48.463
I don't like him.
I really don't like him.

36:48.465 --> 36:50.098
Okay.
I hate it. Take him away.

36:50.100 --> 36:51.766
Take him away.
Yeah, here we go.

36:51.768 --> 36:54.436
How do I take him away?
Quick, quick.

36:54.438 --> 36:56.471
'Cause we also need
to get back to work.

36:56.473 --> 36:59.174
So you've had enough
days off, haven't you?

36:59.176 --> 37:00.975
And I have a closing to go to.

37:00.977 --> 37:03.945
Stop! Stop!
Thank you. Thank you.

37:03.947 --> 37:07.048
Now, ladies, as you know,
Dick Duncan is fast approaching.

37:07.050 --> 37:09.584
And, yes, we made
the playoffs quite easily.

37:09.586 --> 37:11.953
But there's always room
for improvement.

37:11.955 --> 37:14.823
Except for you, Rosey,
since you still can't play yet.

37:14.825 --> 37:17.926
No. My new partner is
going to be...

37:19.229 --> 37:20.895
Madi.

37:22.933 --> 37:25.600
Now is time to arouse our me--

37:27.237 --> 37:29.771
Are you good?

37:29.773 --> 37:33.842
Ahem, it's time to arouse
our mental toughness, ladies.

37:33.844 --> 37:36.845
- Losers are not welcome here.
- No!

37:36.847 --> 37:39.180
- I didn't hear you!
- No!

37:39.182 --> 37:42.484
- I still didn't hear you!
- No!

37:42.486 --> 37:45.019
- We must act like winners...
- Now!

37:45.021 --> 37:47.522
We cannot play tennis
without confidence.

37:47.524 --> 37:50.225
We cannot play tennis
without balls.

37:50.227 --> 37:53.228
We cannot play tennis
without grit.

37:53.230 --> 37:56.698
And remember,
there's no "me" in team.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.533
Thanks.

38:01.805 --> 38:03.905
Ladies! Yes!

38:03.907 --> 38:07.675
Yes, I have
important, important news.

38:07.677 --> 38:12.580
Okay. The Dick Duncan Tournament
needs another 3.0 team to play,

38:12.582 --> 38:15.850
so it's come down to us
and the Cost Cup Country Club.

38:15.852 --> 38:17.252
Can you repeat that?

38:17.254 --> 38:20.221
We have been
consistently average,

38:20.223 --> 38:22.957
but we still need
to practice very hard. Why?

38:22.959 --> 38:26.794
Because we can take this.
This clinic can take this.

38:26.796 --> 38:28.696
If we beat the Cost Cup,

38:28.698 --> 38:30.298
then we're going to play
the champs,

38:30.300 --> 38:34.736
the Mason Agents, at Elite
at the Dick Duncan Tournament.

38:34.738 --> 38:36.104
No, no, no, no. I can't.

38:36.106 --> 38:38.206
Of course you can.
No, I really can't.

38:38.208 --> 38:40.608
Of course you can.
We'll work on your footwork.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.977
Valentina, you're up first.
I can't play the Mason Agents.

38:42.979 --> 38:45.313
Try to catch me!
I don't like it either.

38:45.315 --> 38:47.148
Who's this Dick Duncan, anyway?

38:47.150 --> 38:48.883
Dick Duncan only saved tennis.

38:48.885 --> 38:51.553
Try to catch me!
It was Dick Duncan

38:51.555 --> 38:53.955
who predicted aluminum racquets
would ruin the game.

38:53.957 --> 38:56.758
He stopped the production
of aluminum tennis racquets?

38:56.760 --> 38:59.060
I don't think so.
He just talked a lot about it.

38:59.062 --> 39:00.995
And then he became
a local legend

39:00.997 --> 39:03.898
who underwrote the tournament
that beared his name.

39:03.900 --> 39:06.167
But we're just a clinic,
Fernando. We're not even a team.

39:06.169 --> 39:10.905
Are we even 3.0?
Ha! You are now.

39:10.907 --> 39:14.809
3.0 just means that you're
a little bit better than sucky.

39:14.811 --> 39:17.612
Valentina and Madi,
you're gonna play first doubles.

39:17.614 --> 39:20.915
Jane, you and CeeCee,
second doubles.

39:20.917 --> 39:23.751
And, Preeti, singles. Okay?

39:23.753 --> 39:26.921
Madi, try and catch me, okay?

39:30.827 --> 39:33.628
I gave up playing matches
'cause they make me sick.

39:33.630 --> 39:35.363
I can't sleep
the night before a match.

39:35.365 --> 39:38.232
I'm nauseous until the match,
and then I suck. I hate it.

39:38.234 --> 39:40.101
Reverse!
That's why I only take a clinic.

39:40.103 --> 39:41.736
Maybe you should try
coconut water.

39:41.738 --> 39:43.805
It's not that simple.
It gives you energy,

39:43.807 --> 39:45.873
lowers blood pressure,
keeps you hydrated.

39:45.875 --> 39:49.844
You should try it.
Coconut oil is a good lubricant.

39:49.846 --> 39:52.146
Stop. Stop.

39:53.216 --> 39:55.683
Guys, I come in here,

39:55.685 --> 39:57.685
and I tell you
that you have a chance

39:57.687 --> 39:59.787
to be in
a <i> torneo de</i> Dick Duncan,

39:59.789 --> 40:02.156
and you're over here
talking coconuts?

40:08.798 --> 40:12.233
Ladies, we can do this,

40:12.235 --> 40:14.802
but we have to practice.

40:14.804 --> 40:17.972
And we have
to get rid of some bad habits.

40:17.974 --> 40:19.874
Valentina,<i> mi amor,</i>
I need you to stop

40:19.876 --> 40:22.410
saying "bad motherfucker"
every time you hit the ball.

40:22.412 --> 40:25.313
They'll frown upon that. Preeti,
you have to stop laughing

40:25.315 --> 40:27.015
every time
you get into a long rally.

40:27.017 --> 40:30.885
Jane, if you could
stop saying "louf"

40:30.887 --> 40:34.255
instead of "love,"
because that annoys everyone.

40:34.257 --> 40:36.891
It's <i> l'oeuf,</i> actually.

40:36.893 --> 40:39.427
The term comes from
the French.

40:39.429 --> 40:41.262
<i>L'oeuf</i> means "the egg"...
Right.

40:41.264 --> 40:43.665
...which is round,
like a zero.

40:43.667 --> 40:46.434
Eggs aren't exactly round.
They are French eggs.

40:46.436 --> 40:50.271
Okay. Okay.
CeeCee, whatever you must do,

40:50.273 --> 40:52.073
just get rid of your demons.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.841
Well, what about Madi?

40:54.978 --> 40:57.378
I don't have any grit.

40:57.380 --> 40:59.914
Boom! Madi lacks grit.

40:59.916 --> 41:02.150
Good. Satisfied? Okay.

41:02.152 --> 41:04.786
Let's work on your feet.

41:04.788 --> 41:06.721
Why are you looking at me?

41:10.694 --> 41:12.727
Mason Agents,
where everyone's a winner.

41:12.729 --> 41:14.028
Again.

41:15.298 --> 41:17.331
Mason Agents,
where everyone's a winner.

41:17.333 --> 41:18.833
Again.

41:18.835 --> 41:20.702
Mason Agents,
where everyone's winner.

41:20.704 --> 41:23.404
Yes. Ashalee is here.
Please hold. Thank you.

41:23.406 --> 41:26.007
Madi, Madi.
You can't be "as good as."

41:26.009 --> 41:27.842
You have to be "better than."

41:27.844 --> 41:29.977
Have you even had
a whiff of a new lead yet?

41:29.979 --> 41:31.412
Actually, I was just...

41:31.414 --> 41:33.948
Mason Agents,
where everyone's a winner!

41:33.950 --> 41:35.950
Of course you may speak with me.

41:35.952 --> 41:38.453
Please hold
for 10 seconds or less.

41:40.256 --> 41:43.324
You see?
That is how it's done.

41:43.326 --> 41:45.293
Believe and achieve, Madi.

41:45.295 --> 41:48.963
B-A-A... A.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.508
Mason Agents,
where everyone's a winner.

42:00.510 --> 42:04.779
Is there a specific agent
you'd like to speak with?

42:04.781 --> 42:07.281
Sure. Sure. Yeah. Yeah.
I'd be happy to help.

42:07.283 --> 42:09.050
Uh, what's the address?

42:09.052 --> 42:12.253
Mm-hm. Sorry, you said Bay Lane?

42:13.823 --> 42:15.790
Okay, ow! What?
Got it.

42:20.463 --> 42:24.932
And, um, you... You haven't
worked with an agent yet?

42:26.770 --> 42:30.838
Yeah, sure. Yeah. I can meet.
Uh, when would you...?

42:30.840 --> 42:33.508
Sure. Yeah.

42:33.510 --> 42:36.778
Sure. Yeah. Okay.
See you soon. Bye.

42:38.047 --> 42:41.115
Dick Duncan's mansion
is on Bay.

42:41.117 --> 42:42.817
Hey, who was that?

42:42.819 --> 42:44.552
Oh. Oh, just, uh, nobody.

42:44.554 --> 42:47.221
Random-- Random--
Random lead. Heh, yeah.

42:47.223 --> 42:48.890
Wait! Where are you going?

42:48.892 --> 42:51.025
Oh, just, uh,
to believe and achieve.

42:51.027 --> 42:53.127
Your job is to generate
new sales leads.

42:53.129 --> 42:56.164
Yeah. And believe and achieve!
No! Ugh!

42:56.166 --> 42:57.298
Mary Beth!
What?

42:57.300 --> 42:59.433
Dick Duncan is dead.

42:59.435 --> 43:01.502
Duh! He died in December.

43:01.504 --> 43:03.504
But that could have
been his son.

43:03.506 --> 43:05.840
Little Dick.

43:05.842 --> 43:08.142
Ugh, they call him Jackson.
Let's go.

43:10.213 --> 43:12.280
Hurry up!
I'm coming.

43:16.352 --> 43:18.920
Has Grace ever sold a house?

43:18.922 --> 43:20.555
No.

43:20.557 --> 43:22.490
She has an incredible backhand.

43:40.109 --> 43:42.176
Hey. I'm Madi.
Jackson.

43:42.178 --> 43:44.312
Come on in.
Thanks.

43:50.486 --> 43:53.321
Huh.
Yeah, it's, uh...

43:53.323 --> 43:55.590
It's odd, right?

43:55.592 --> 44:00.194
Yeah. I've never seen
cherubs playing tennis before.

44:00.196 --> 44:03.564
No, those are butterfly nets.

44:03.566 --> 44:06.334
No, I think they're racquets.
You see the grips?

44:06.336 --> 44:08.069
Oh, yeah, there's a tennis ball.

44:08.071 --> 44:10.338
It's being lobbed
over that guy's head.

44:10.340 --> 44:13.941
Huh, I never noticed.

44:13.943 --> 44:17.612
But I'm not surprised. My father
had a deviant sense of humor.

44:17.614 --> 44:20.381
And he loved tennis.

44:20.383 --> 44:24.252
Anyway, the house,
uh, was built in 1918.

44:24.254 --> 44:27.021
Come on. I'll show you around.

44:27.023 --> 44:29.657
You okay in those shoes?
Yeah.

44:29.659 --> 44:32.260
Oh, your floors.
I'll just take 'em off.

44:32.262 --> 44:34.896
No, no, no. It's just,
it's a lot of walking.

44:34.898 --> 44:37.231
There's 13 bedrooms and parlors.

44:37.233 --> 44:40.401
I'm pretty sure
there's 14 baths.

44:40.403 --> 44:44.071
Library. Chef's kitchen
through those double doors.

44:46.209 --> 44:48.376
What do you think's
happening in there?

44:48.378 --> 44:50.978
She's having an orgasm.

44:50.980 --> 44:53.047
Oh.

44:53.049 --> 44:55.049
It's the listing of a lifetime.

44:55.051 --> 44:59.086
Selling Dick's house
means more to Bobbi than...

44:59.088 --> 45:01.322
Than what? Than what?

45:01.324 --> 45:04.692
Than the Dick Duncan trophy
itself.

45:04.694 --> 45:06.994
Now you're lying.
That is for real.

45:06.996 --> 45:08.930
No.
We ought to go tell her.

45:08.932 --> 45:10.364
She's gonna kill us.

45:10.366 --> 45:12.466
Can we get a milkshake?

45:12.468 --> 45:13.467
If we have time.

45:16.539 --> 45:18.339
How long have you lived here?

45:18.341 --> 45:20.541
Well, I live in Brooklyn.
Oh.

45:20.543 --> 45:22.510
My son and I
and sometimes his nanny

45:22.512 --> 45:26.213
spend weekends
and school breaks here.

45:26.215 --> 45:29.550
I never actually lived here.
I lived with my mom.

45:29.552 --> 45:31.552
And we'd visit my father
in the summers.

45:33.623 --> 45:35.389
And this isn't my life.

45:35.391 --> 45:38.726
It's my father's, and I wasn't
really a part of that.

45:38.728 --> 45:42.463
Plus, this is no place
to raise a child.

45:42.465 --> 45:46.000
Yeah. Mansions can be
really tough on kids.

45:46.002 --> 45:49.203
Don't get me wrong.
It's a nice place to visit.

45:49.205 --> 45:53.374
But I'm worried
that he'll feel lonely.

45:53.376 --> 45:57.578
To be honest,
sometimes it's kind of creepy.

45:57.580 --> 45:59.547
Like, I mean,
have you seen <i> The Shining?</i>

46:01.050 --> 46:03.317
"Red rum" spelled backwards.

46:03.319 --> 46:06.721
Always thought that kid
was saying "red room."

46:06.723 --> 46:09.724
That would be "moorder."

46:09.726 --> 46:13.160
"Moorder."

46:13.162 --> 46:15.062
The point is, I...

46:15.064 --> 46:19.633
I want something homier,
but nearby.

46:19.635 --> 46:24.205
I think it's time
to get away from Brooklyn.

46:24.207 --> 46:28.009
I might actually know a property
not too far from here.

46:28.011 --> 46:29.710
Well, I'd love to take a look,

46:29.712 --> 46:32.513
but we're leaving
early tomorrow.

46:32.515 --> 46:34.615
Let me make a phone call.

46:42.025 --> 46:43.524
<i>There's No Place Like Home.</i>

46:43.526 --> 46:46.027
<i>Melania Trump speaking.</i>
Alex. Alex, it's Madi.

46:47.630 --> 46:49.697
Do you remember
that craftsman I listed

46:49.699 --> 46:52.733
right before I left?
<i>Before you were fired.</i>

46:52.735 --> 46:54.435
Who'd it go to?

46:55.538 --> 46:57.238
<i>A new agent. We all like her.</i>

46:57.240 --> 46:59.740
I was just wondering if she--
Oh, shit!

47:01.144 --> 47:02.510
<i>What? What'd you just say?</i>

47:02.512 --> 47:03.511
Nothing.

47:07.650 --> 47:11.519
Um, do you think
she could show it for me?

47:11.521 --> 47:13.387
<i>Look, I don't think
she can do it.</i>

47:13.389 --> 47:15.423
Okay. She has to.
I'm in <i> The Shining</i>

47:15.425 --> 47:20.461
and I'm bleeding.
<i>Okay. Don't be so dramatic.</i>

47:38.815 --> 47:40.147
Hello?

47:53.729 --> 47:55.296
Hello?

47:56.699 --> 47:59.166
I'm Mr. Lee.

48:07.443 --> 48:09.610
I brought back the costume.

48:09.612 --> 48:11.879
The <i> Gremlin</i> costume.

48:11.881 --> 48:15.783
I got it cleaned and fixed.
Sorry it took so long.

48:15.785 --> 48:18.285
The kid who works here,
it wasn't his fault.

48:18.287 --> 48:22.123
You leave it here.
Sure. Thanks.

48:22.125 --> 48:25.326
Gum ball?
No, no, no. I'm okay.

48:25.328 --> 48:28.262
Oh, God! Oh! Sorry.

48:29.499 --> 48:30.831
You should be.

48:30.833 --> 48:33.501
That belonged
to U.S. tennis pro Anne White

48:33.503 --> 48:35.402
who wore it
in Wimbledon, 1985.

48:35.404 --> 48:36.871
Wow!

48:36.873 --> 48:38.272
Oh.

48:40.309 --> 48:42.176
Would you take 50 bucks for it?

48:42.178 --> 48:44.512
With that outfit comes
great responsibility.

48:44.514 --> 48:46.747
I will not sell at any price.

48:48.551 --> 48:49.617
Hundred bucks?

48:49.619 --> 48:51.318
Okay.

48:56.526 --> 48:59.293
You look
like a colossal sperm.

49:00.296 --> 49:02.696
Ridiculous. Come on.

49:12.175 --> 49:17.311
Dr. Cohen, Dr. Kaplan,
Dr. Kline and Jeff,

49:17.313 --> 49:19.847
please meet me
on Court 11 today.

49:51.581 --> 49:54.815
<i>Madi? Madi?</i>

49:54.817 --> 49:57.618
<i>What the hell
are you wearing, Madi?</i>

49:59.455 --> 50:01.622
<i>Madi? Madi?</i>

50:01.624 --> 50:04.558
<i>Madi, who is not
returning my texts. Madi?</i>

50:04.560 --> 50:06.460
Sorry.
Who is that?

50:07.730 --> 50:09.330
No idea.
<i>Okay, Madi.</i>

50:09.332 --> 50:10.731
<i>So I called your office,</i>

50:10.733 --> 50:12.466
<i>and, uh, Judy Garland
answered.</i>

50:12.468 --> 50:14.368
<i>Said you haven't worked
there in a while.</i>

50:14.370 --> 50:16.003
<i>Something about</i>
<i>a</i> Grit <i> episode.</i>

50:16.005 --> 50:19.240
Okay. There's no Judy Garland
at Mason Agents.

50:19.242 --> 50:21.408
Is there?
<i>I know you can hear me, Madi.</i>

50:21.410 --> 50:24.578
<i>Madi Cooke, will you at least
keep your elbow in front?</i>

50:24.580 --> 50:26.680
<i>Did you learn nothing
from me in high school?</i>

50:26.682 --> 50:28.916
Ha, it's so weird.

50:28.918 --> 50:31.852
Madi Sharapovaklavacki?
Hm?

50:31.854 --> 50:33.587
Could I talk to you?

50:33.589 --> 50:36.590
Security is very lax
in this place.

50:36.592 --> 50:38.459
Okay. I feel
a little responsible

50:38.461 --> 50:40.894
for that loss just now.
You saw the <i> Grit</i> episode.

50:40.896 --> 50:43.364
What <i> Grit</i> episode?
Shut the fuck up.

50:43.366 --> 50:45.966
No, seriously.
Like, I don't watch <i> Grit.</i>

50:47.570 --> 50:49.036
I mean not since that bitch

50:49.038 --> 50:50.938
squashed the pygmy tarsier.
Get out!

50:50.940 --> 50:51.972
No.

50:54.744 --> 50:56.744
How are you
still acting like this?

50:56.746 --> 50:58.679
Didn't you grow out of this?
Like what?

50:58.681 --> 51:02.016
Like you're so superior
and better than everyone.

51:02.018 --> 51:04.618
Um, well, probably
because I could have beaten

51:04.620 --> 51:07.621
the housewives of Connecticut
a few minutes ago.

51:07.623 --> 51:09.023
But, honestly, off the court,

51:09.025 --> 51:11.725
I'm really just barely
holding it together.

51:11.727 --> 51:14.728
I am wondering why
my best friend hasn't said,

51:14.730 --> 51:17.631
"Hey, Ollie. How's it going?
What are you doing here?

51:17.633 --> 51:19.433
I haven't
heard from you in months.

51:19.435 --> 51:21.602
Are you okay?"
I know what you're doing here.

51:21.604 --> 51:24.672
You're here because
my mother asked you to come.

51:24.674 --> 51:28.309
That might be part
of the equation, yeah. Okay.

51:28.311 --> 51:30.944
I hate your boyfriend.
I hate him.

51:30.946 --> 51:34.982
Okay? I hate him.
He's the worst.

51:34.984 --> 51:38.786
He's a vlogger.
Who's a vlogger anymore?

51:38.788 --> 51:40.788
And he wears open-toed shoes.

51:40.790 --> 51:42.456
Lay off.
His feet need to breathe.

51:42.458 --> 51:44.325
Ew! Ugh!
You know what? It's--

51:44.327 --> 51:46.060
It's suffocating
sometimes in socks.

51:46.062 --> 51:47.961
Ugh! I hate that.

51:47.963 --> 51:50.964
I hate that his feet need
to breathe, and I hate--

51:50.966 --> 51:53.067
I hate that he's mean to you.

51:53.069 --> 51:55.002
'Cause you know
that he's mean to you.

51:55.004 --> 51:56.770
And you know what?
Guess what else?

51:56.772 --> 51:59.340
He was a real dick to me.

51:59.342 --> 52:02.076
You know he was. And you
just, like, let it happen.

52:06.048 --> 52:09.683
This is a really nice car.
Is that a backup camera?

52:09.685 --> 52:14.521
Yes. I have a backup camera,
all sorts of features.

52:14.523 --> 52:16.990
Okay. So he did
actually get a real job

52:16.992 --> 52:19.360
in an office and everything,
so lay off that.

52:19.362 --> 52:21.362
Whoa, cool.

52:21.364 --> 52:25.666
You know, I really needed you
when Steven and I broke up.

52:25.668 --> 52:28.936
I came all the way
out to L.A. to be with you,

52:28.938 --> 52:31.705
and, like, suddenly
you're not allowed out.

52:31.707 --> 52:34.742
I was allowed out.
It wasn't a prison situation.

52:34.744 --> 52:36.577
Oh, right. Oh, I'm sorry.

52:36.579 --> 52:40.614
The-- The three of us had
that one 20-minute lunch.

52:40.616 --> 52:42.416
And by the way,
like I really wanted

52:42.418 --> 52:45.119
to fuckin' hang out with Albert.
It's "Albert."

52:45.121 --> 52:47.388
I'm not gonna
say "Albert," okay?

52:47.390 --> 52:49.857
I mean, it's his name.
No, it's not really his name.

52:49.859 --> 52:52.393
His name is Albert.
You know, I did just tell you

52:52.395 --> 52:53.927
that he got a real job.

52:53.929 --> 52:56.697
He doesn't have it anymore,
but that's beside the point

52:56.699 --> 52:58.632
because he's also
no longer in my life.

52:58.634 --> 53:01.602
I'm pretty hungry.
Can we get some food?

53:01.604 --> 53:05.506
There is no one in the world
named Madi Sharapovaklavacki

53:05.508 --> 53:08.642
except in Hungary, where
there are hundreds of them.

53:08.644 --> 53:10.878
Did you try Madeline?

53:10.880 --> 53:13.147
You're overfeeding Bjِrn Borg.

53:13.149 --> 53:15.849
Fine.

53:15.851 --> 53:19.086
Nope.
Okay, try "Madi from <i> Grit."</i>

53:19.088 --> 53:20.487
Stupid.

53:23.125 --> 53:26.059
Oh, shit!
Is that her?

53:26.061 --> 53:28.128
Yeah. I'd recognize
that racquet anywhere.

53:28.130 --> 53:30.798
Oh, my God.
Okay. Give me some room.

53:30.800 --> 53:32.533
God. Fuck.

53:32.535 --> 53:34.034
All we need to know is,

53:34.036 --> 53:36.804
does she have
any listings with us?

53:36.806 --> 53:39.506
She may have a very big one.

53:39.508 --> 53:44.044
Okay. Okay. Okay. Hit me.

53:44.046 --> 53:45.679
Dick Duncan.

53:45.681 --> 53:47.614
No!

53:47.616 --> 53:50.617
No! No!

53:50.619 --> 53:51.885
Okay. Cool.

53:51.887 --> 53:53.620
It's okay. You're fine.
You're fine.

53:53.622 --> 53:56.223
Yeah. But it's gonna be
a really good sale.

53:56.225 --> 53:57.958
That is a big one.
Yeah.

53:57.960 --> 53:59.092
God for her.
Yeah.

53:59.094 --> 54:01.662
Wow!
Okay. I'm gonna wait

54:01.664 --> 54:04.731
until she signs the listing
as a Mason Agent.

54:04.733 --> 54:06.467
Yes.

54:06.469 --> 54:09.169
Yes. And then I'm going
to fire her ass.

54:09.171 --> 54:10.604
Pow.
Yes!

54:10.606 --> 54:13.740
And the house will be mine.
Bitch!

54:13.742 --> 54:15.642
Mwah-ha-ha-ha!

54:15.644 --> 54:18.545
I... I shouldn't do that.
I want you to leave the room.

54:23.185 --> 54:25.085
Happy Town?

54:25.087 --> 54:27.020
What? You lost a lot of weight.

54:27.022 --> 54:29.690
- Whoa! What do you mean a lot?
- <i>Welcome to Happy Town.</i>

54:29.692 --> 54:31.225
<i>Can I take your order, please?</i>

54:31.227 --> 54:33.026
Are you saying I was fat?

54:33.028 --> 54:34.928
<i>Ma'am?</i>
Well, she means you.

54:34.930 --> 54:36.797
No.

54:36.799 --> 54:39.566
I'll have an oxburger
cheesy patty, no lettuce,

54:39.568 --> 54:42.035
and a sparkly water, please.
"Sparkling."

54:42.037 --> 54:43.937
That's what I said. Sparkly.
No.

54:43.939 --> 54:46.273
Sparkly water is not a thing.

54:46.275 --> 54:48.175
So, what are you saying?

54:48.177 --> 54:50.043
- <i>Me?</i>
- No.

54:50.045 --> 54:53.046
Could I please have
some Happy Town Brick Bricks

54:53.048 --> 54:56.517
and a side of curly nae-naes,
large diet.

54:59.154 --> 55:01.688
I'm really sorry
he broke up with you,

55:01.690 --> 55:03.824
even though he's an asshole.

55:03.826 --> 55:05.559
<i>What did he do to you?</i>

55:05.561 --> 55:09.830
The slimy bastard had an affair
on his desk at work.

55:09.832 --> 55:11.265
And it's on YouTube.

55:11.267 --> 55:13.867
<i>Oh, well.
At least you caught him.</i>

55:13.869 --> 55:16.303
<i>Imagine if you never knew
they were fucking.</i>

55:16.305 --> 55:18.105
<i>Please drive up.</i>

55:18.107 --> 55:19.740
She was nice.

55:26.048 --> 55:29.850
His affair is on YouTube?
How's that even possible?

55:29.852 --> 55:33.120
Yeah.

55:33.122 --> 55:35.188
You look much better blond.

55:35.190 --> 55:38.091
You kind of look like, um...
Doris Day.

55:38.093 --> 55:42.062
No. Kind of like Ryan Gosling.

55:43.866 --> 55:45.265
It wasn't the whole affair.

55:45.267 --> 55:48.201
It was just the one time
caught on surveillance.

55:48.203 --> 55:50.737
It was taken down
really quickly,

55:50.739 --> 55:53.307
but I threw up for
like three days straight.

56:13.062 --> 56:16.330
I'm sorry. I haven't been
a very good friend, Ollie.

56:16.332 --> 56:19.833
No. No, I should have been there
for you after Stephan.

56:19.835 --> 56:21.201
Steven.

56:23.939 --> 56:27.674
I really miss you.
I really miss you too.

56:27.676 --> 56:30.043
I know you had your whole
perfect Connecticut life

56:30.045 --> 56:31.378
like all mapped out.

56:31.380 --> 56:34.147
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it sucked.

56:34.149 --> 56:37.050
I immersed myself in work,
and you know what, it turns out

56:37.052 --> 56:39.853
I'm a damn good realtor.
Yeah.

56:39.855 --> 56:42.723
Then this whole <i> Grit</i> thing
happens. It's a total joke.

56:42.725 --> 56:45.726
I never dreamed
I'd be called in.

56:45.728 --> 56:47.961
And then, like, I thought
maybe it'd help me

56:47.963 --> 56:52.065
build back my confidence
or whatever,

56:52.067 --> 56:53.834
and now look what happened.

56:53.836 --> 56:56.837
No, 'cause you are still
a damn good tennis player.

56:56.839 --> 56:58.772
I am?

57:00.242 --> 57:02.809
You think so?

57:06.949 --> 57:09.149
When was the last time
you smacked some balls?

57:11.253 --> 57:14.087
Seriously?
You're asking me that?

57:14.089 --> 57:15.756
Mm-hm.

57:18.260 --> 57:21.228
You really look
like Ryan Gosling.

57:21.230 --> 57:22.696
It's freaking me out.

57:24.833 --> 57:27.067
Hey, girl.
It's him. It's him.

57:38.380 --> 57:40.447
We're not staying.

57:40.449 --> 57:41.915
I made you apple cake.

57:41.917 --> 57:43.684
What's going on?
Ollie Twittered me.

57:43.686 --> 57:45.752
She said the two of you
are playing tennis.

57:45.754 --> 57:46.987
I already told you that.

57:46.989 --> 57:48.722
She joined my clinic
two weeks ago.

57:48.724 --> 57:50.390
She's been beating you
in the drills.

57:50.392 --> 57:52.192
She was always better,
I think.

57:52.194 --> 57:54.161
- Ma!
- Tell her the other thing.

57:54.163 --> 57:56.730
Ollie said
you met a boy from Brooklyn.

57:56.732 --> 57:58.832
He's a client. And barely.

57:58.834 --> 58:01.101
We haven't even signed
a listing agreement yet.

58:01.103 --> 58:03.870
He's in a messy divorce.
It's a complicated sale.

58:03.872 --> 58:07.140
You know the story of how
I met your father in Brooklyn.

58:07.142 --> 58:09.443
Jackson's not
from Flatbush, okay?

58:09.445 --> 58:14.181
He's from the new Brooklyn,
and it's not what you think.

58:17.052 --> 58:18.885
<i>Your daily reminder:</i>

58:18.887 --> 58:22.089
<i>Don't flush girly things
down the toilet.</i>

58:22.091 --> 58:23.824
<i>We're having issues.</i>

58:23.826 --> 58:25.192
CeeCee,
you have to calm down.

58:25.194 --> 58:27.227
I'm trying. I even searched

58:27.229 --> 58:29.262
how to calm nerves
before a tennis match.

58:29.264 --> 58:31.131
And out of nowhere,
the top 10 things

58:31.133 --> 58:32.933
never to say to your children
popped up.

58:32.935 --> 58:35.368
Uh-oh.
Yes, I said them all.

58:35.370 --> 58:38.071
Stop. Do you know
that there are 40 ways

58:38.073 --> 58:40.107
your body changes after 40?

58:40.109 --> 58:41.441
Of course I know that.

58:41.443 --> 58:44.277
Okay. Well, I'm at least 50,

58:44.279 --> 58:47.013
so all of it must have
already happened, right?

58:47.015 --> 58:51.785
But you don't see me giving up.
Nice racquet.

58:51.787 --> 58:55.355
Wait. You're 50?
At least.

58:55.357 --> 58:57.157
Does Fernando know?

58:57.159 --> 58:58.892
Dick Duncan is 35 and over.

58:58.894 --> 59:01.027
Technically, 50 is over 35.

59:01.029 --> 59:02.996
There's a separate team
for 50 and over.

59:02.998 --> 59:05.532
If the other team finds out,
we could be disqualified.

59:05.534 --> 59:08.168
Okay. Well, that's ageism.
No. Those are the rules.

59:08.170 --> 59:09.770
Oh, are there rules

59:09.772 --> 59:11.505
about doping?
Mi-mi-mi-mi.

59:11.507 --> 59:13.874
<i>The other team has arrived.</i>

59:13.876 --> 59:16.143
Come on, you guys.

59:16.145 --> 59:18.245
It's time.
<i>They look coordinated.</i>

59:18.247 --> 59:20.380
I gotta pee again.
Oh, my God.

59:20.382 --> 59:22.249
Are they coming?

59:22.251 --> 59:24.151
Yeah, they're just
in the locker room.

59:24.153 --> 59:26.052
Oh, that place has not changed.

59:26.054 --> 59:27.988
Do you remember
your old locker number?

59:27.990 --> 59:30.524
I feel like such a liar, Ollie.

59:30.526 --> 59:33.226
You do or you don't?
Seriously.

59:33.228 --> 59:35.495
I haven't told them
about Mason Agents.

59:35.497 --> 59:37.063
Well, today is not the day.

59:37.065 --> 59:38.865
We're probably gonna
lose this game.

59:38.867 --> 59:40.567
Yeah, but what if we win?

59:40.569 --> 59:43.170
How much longer are you
planning on working there,

59:43.172 --> 59:45.438
Madi Sharapovaklavacki?

59:45.440 --> 59:47.140
It's true.

59:49.211 --> 59:51.845
This hallway.
I know, ha!

59:51.847 --> 59:54.514
Someone needs to buy this place
and give it a facelift.

59:54.516 --> 59:56.550
You should buy it.
No, you should buy it.

59:56.552 --> 59:58.919
No, you should buy it.
No, you should buy it.

59:58.921 --> 01:00:01.488
You are not faster than me.
What are you talking about?

01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:03.323
You'll never be faster than me!

01:00:09.565 --> 01:00:13.099
You guys, seriously,
I might throw up.

01:00:13.101 --> 01:00:14.868
Now I'm getting nervous too.

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:17.103
Do you need
pharmaceutical help?

01:00:17.105 --> 01:00:18.205
Hey, stop.

01:00:18.207 --> 01:00:20.907
CeeCee, if you need to relax,

01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:22.909
you take a deep breath in
through your nose,

01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:25.445
hold it, and let it out
through your mouth. Okay?

01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:30.350
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:30.352 --> 01:00:33.086
If you're under pressure,
take a couple short breaths,

01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:36.256
hold it, and then let it out
through your mouth like...

01:00:41.597 --> 01:00:43.997
Yeah. Okay.

01:00:43.999 --> 01:00:46.366
And don't worry
about winning or losing.

01:00:46.368 --> 01:00:48.435
Every point is
just the first point.

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:51.171
The most important thing to do
is to focus on a strategy.

01:00:51.173 --> 01:00:55.275
Focus on a strategy. F-O-S, FOS.

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:57.344
Think about
where you want the ball to go.

01:00:57.346 --> 01:01:01.081
You see it in your mind,
and it goes there. I promise.

01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:10.390
We should get uniforms.

01:01:10.392 --> 01:01:12.592
They're wearing
tennis-ball yellow.

01:01:12.594 --> 01:01:15.528
On purpose. Tennis whores!

01:01:19.368 --> 01:01:23.336
Focus. Focus. Okay.
The rules are simple.

01:01:23.338 --> 01:01:26.106
Everyone's gonna play two sets.
Six games each. Okay?

01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:28.308
In case of a tie break,

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:29.509
seven-point game.

01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:30.977
When the buzzer sounds,

01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:33.146
they're gonna tally up
all the games.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:35.315
The team
with the most winning games

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:37.250
is gonna go on
to play the Mason Agents

01:01:37.252 --> 01:01:39.152
for the <i> torneo de</i> Dick Duncan.

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:41.221
There's three fresh balls
on each court.

01:01:41.223 --> 01:01:46.593
Ollie, my superstar, you stay
warm and ready. Okay?

01:01:54.603 --> 01:01:58.605
Have fun, ladies. Have fun.

01:02:01.977 --> 01:02:03.643
He's just gonna leave us here?

01:02:05.714 --> 01:02:08.581
Okay. Tell me.
No, don't tell me.

01:02:09.685 --> 01:02:11.484
Is CeeCee serving?

01:02:11.486 --> 01:02:13.954
Yeah, I can't see CeeCee.

01:02:19.594 --> 01:02:21.661
Hit the damn ball already.

01:02:23.565 --> 01:02:24.998
I hate this!

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.667
CeeCee, remember to breathe.
Okay.

01:02:27.669 --> 01:02:29.602
<i>Breathe in through your nose.</i>

01:02:29.604 --> 01:02:33.206
<i>Hold it, then let it out
through your mouth.</i>

01:02:39.681 --> 01:02:41.314
What's happening?

01:02:41.316 --> 01:02:44.617
CeeCee's nostrils are
flaring like crazy.

01:02:44.619 --> 01:02:46.086
Oh, no.

01:02:46.088 --> 01:02:48.488
What? What? No! No!
Don't tell me.

01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:51.091
There's a dimply butt
fully hanging out

01:02:51.093 --> 01:02:53.093
of a yellow skirt
on court four.

01:02:53.095 --> 01:02:56.329
Is it terrible?
Just dimply.

01:02:56.331 --> 01:02:59.666
But these binoculars
are, like, really strong.

01:02:59.668 --> 01:03:01.768
Are we losing?

01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:03.570
I don't know.

01:03:03.572 --> 01:03:05.205
Ugh, I can't.

01:03:08.043 --> 01:03:09.576
Got it.

01:03:16.785 --> 01:03:19.252
Yeah!

01:03:21.423 --> 01:03:23.156
Bam, motherfucker!

01:03:29.398 --> 01:03:31.731
Mary Beth! Mary Beth!

01:03:31.733 --> 01:03:34.034
Apparently Acme doesn't
answer their phone,

01:03:34.036 --> 01:03:36.269
so I need you
to call your friend

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:37.771
and find out
if there's a winner.

01:03:37.773 --> 01:03:40.407
Also, find out the name
of Madi's partner pronto.

01:03:40.409 --> 01:03:43.043
Already did.
Valentina Maria Goldfarb.

01:03:43.045 --> 01:03:44.644
No winner yet.
Okay. Good.

01:03:44.646 --> 01:03:46.479
Goldfarb. I need her Instagram,

01:03:46.481 --> 01:03:48.281
Twitter, Snapchat,
all that shit.

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:50.116
I'm gonna destroy her too, yeah.

01:03:50.118 --> 01:03:51.584
Great. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:03:51.586 --> 01:03:55.121
Grace! Grace? Grace, good.

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:57.824
Find the cutest picture
of one of those pygmy things,

01:03:57.826 --> 01:03:59.359
the ones that Madi murdered?

01:03:59.361 --> 01:04:01.261
I'm gonna use it
to get into her head.

01:04:01.263 --> 01:04:03.463
I wanna bait her with it.
I'm the master at that.

01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:05.398
Yes, ma'am.
You are the master baiter.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.101
I know.

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:12.172
Ow.

01:04:22.818 --> 01:04:25.118
- Five serving two.
- Come on, CeeCee.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.787
I know you have
enough grit for this.

01:04:27.789 --> 01:04:29.355
You are gritless.

01:04:29.357 --> 01:04:31.758
The killer of that cute
little rodent.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.494
You're a murderer.
A murderer.

01:04:34.496 --> 01:04:37.163
You look like a colossal sperm.

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:38.798
<i>Ryan Gosling.</i>

01:04:48.276 --> 01:04:49.742
Second serve.

01:04:49.744 --> 01:04:51.644
Be gone, Madi Cooke.

01:04:51.646 --> 01:04:54.614
Be gone.
Losers are not welcome here.

01:04:54.616 --> 01:04:55.682
<i>No!</i>

01:04:55.684 --> 01:04:57.784
Why are you a stupid bitch?

01:04:57.786 --> 01:05:00.854
We cannot play tennis
without grit.

01:05:04.726 --> 01:05:06.693
Sorry, Valentina,
I'm losing focus.

01:05:06.695 --> 01:05:11.164
Don't be sorry. Everyone
double faults sometimes. I do.

01:05:11.166 --> 01:05:13.299
And I'm always fuckin' focused!

01:05:15.403 --> 01:05:16.703
See you seeing me, bitches.

01:05:24.146 --> 01:05:25.812
Love-15.

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:36.189
Switch! Go, Madi, go!

01:05:38.193 --> 01:05:39.859
Yeah! Shit!

01:05:47.869 --> 01:05:49.669
Okay.

01:05:49.671 --> 01:05:52.839
Sorry. Focus on strategy.
F-O-S. F-O-S.

01:05:52.841 --> 01:05:55.375
Check your grip, CeeCee,
and move your feet.

01:05:55.377 --> 01:05:56.442
Don't get in my head.

01:05:56.444 --> 01:05:58.444
Get mad at them, CeeCee.

01:05:58.446 --> 01:06:02.782
Hey, hey, hey!
Ginger sub, no coaching.

01:06:02.784 --> 01:06:04.918
<i>Get mad.</i>

01:06:06.888 --> 01:06:09.355
<i>Heh. Ha!</i>

01:06:11.193 --> 01:06:13.960
<i>It is kind of silly.
Heh-heh-heh!</i>

01:06:16.231 --> 01:06:18.498
<i>Lobbing is not at all funny.</i>

01:06:20.769 --> 01:06:23.937
<i>Stop it!
Stop it with the lobbing!</i>

01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:24.971
<i>Ugh!</i>

01:06:29.978 --> 01:06:33.313
Use your anger, CeeCee. Get mad!

01:06:33.315 --> 01:06:36.549
Really mad!
Hit her in the Botox!

01:06:36.551 --> 01:06:38.351
She doesn't even have
an open stance.

01:06:38.353 --> 01:06:40.587
What?
That bitch is talking again.

01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:43.256
- Ah!
- <i>See it in your mind,</i>

01:06:43.258 --> 01:06:44.991
<i>and you hit it there.</i>

01:06:44.993 --> 01:06:47.260
Use your anger!

01:06:47.262 --> 01:06:49.429
Hit the damn ball already.

01:06:49.431 --> 01:06:50.830
Spaz.

01:06:50.832 --> 01:06:52.599
<i>Hammer! Hammer!</i>

01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:56.569
<i>Hammer!</i>

01:06:57.872 --> 01:06:59.939
I said Botox, not buttocks.

01:06:59.941 --> 01:07:01.841
It wasn't her buttocks,
but it was pretty close.

01:07:01.843 --> 01:07:03.443
Who says "buttocks" anyway?

01:07:03.445 --> 01:07:05.678
I thought you were
just being proper.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.680
Just serve, Jane.
Look, she's fine.

01:07:07.682 --> 01:07:09.482
I need a ball.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:12.418
Where's the third?
I don't see it anywhere.

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:13.720
Do you have the third?

01:07:16.024 --> 01:07:17.857
Oh, shit. Is it in her?

01:07:17.859 --> 01:07:19.592
Don't be ridiculous.
That can't happen.

01:07:19.594 --> 01:07:20.927
But did we win?

01:07:20.929 --> 01:07:23.496
She's not moving.
Does that mean we won?

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:26.432
Thank you.

01:07:29.371 --> 01:07:30.837
Oh, you're amazing!

01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:32.805
I made so many
unforced errors.

01:07:32.807 --> 01:07:35.008
You were so focused.

01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:36.409
Always, always.

01:07:36.411 --> 01:07:39.946
We won 35 to 21 games.

01:07:39.948 --> 01:07:43.883
Everyone played great. And
now we face the Mason Agents.

01:07:43.885 --> 01:07:46.653
For the Dick Duncan trophy,

01:07:46.655 --> 01:07:49.722
which they have won,
what, like five, six times?

01:07:49.724 --> 01:07:51.658
I have to say,
we all look really nice

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.059
in our normal clothes.

01:07:53.061 --> 01:07:55.061
I thought you guys
were all good friends.

01:07:55.063 --> 01:07:56.896
We've had our clinic
every Tuesday

01:07:56.898 --> 01:07:58.531
for three and a half years.

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:00.466
Yeah. We know some things
about each other

01:08:00.468 --> 01:08:03.069
but it's mostly small talk
between the balls.

01:08:03.071 --> 01:08:04.871
Valentina has twin boys,

01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:08.308
but she also creates websites
for local businesses.

01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:10.610
And Preeti here
is a super genius,

01:08:10.612 --> 01:08:12.312
but she likes
our clinic anyway.

01:08:12.314 --> 01:08:14.614
I'm not a super genius.

01:08:14.616 --> 01:08:16.616
You're a scientist. Say.

01:08:16.618 --> 01:08:19.652
And, Jane, well, we don't
know much about Jane.

01:08:19.654 --> 01:08:21.787
Those guys wanna dance with you.

01:08:21.790 --> 01:08:23.055
Oh.

01:08:25.093 --> 01:08:26.993
- Okay.
- Well, ladies,

01:08:26.995 --> 01:08:29.828
with age comes wisdom.

01:08:29.831 --> 01:08:32.031
Good one! Thank you!

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:39.005
So good! So good!
Ooh!

01:08:39.006 --> 01:08:40.907
Okay. We should
go over and say hello.

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:43.076
But we're still getting nachos?
Yeah.

01:08:43.078 --> 01:08:44.644
I'll get the next round.
Okay.

01:08:44.645 --> 01:08:47.714
We should get the guacamole.

01:08:47.716 --> 01:08:51.384
Madi, they are so nice.
I know. They're so nice.

01:08:51.386 --> 01:08:54.754
It's a shame the Tuesday clinic
has to end.

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:56.589
What?
Yeah. Front Desk Debbie said

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:59.058
management is having trouble
keeping the doors open.

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:02.362
With the rent and electric bill,
it's like $4000 a month.

01:09:02.363 --> 01:09:04.063
I thought management
owned Acme.

01:09:04.064 --> 01:09:05.430
Mm, mm-mm.

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:06.933
Who owns it?

01:09:06.935 --> 01:09:09.402
Like, some dead guy.
And that's a direct quote.

01:09:09.404 --> 01:09:10.803
I mean, you have to admit,

01:09:10.805 --> 01:09:12.738
it has turned into
a bit of a shithole.

01:09:12.741 --> 01:09:15.774
What do you mean? The white
lines are the same everywhere.

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:19.145
We used to love Acme as kids.
Yeah, 'cause we were kids.

01:09:19.147 --> 01:09:22.615
Well, all it needs
is a deep clean

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:24.617
and some better lighting.

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:27.386
What?
It needs better everything.

01:09:27.389 --> 01:09:30.857
Don't you remember how happy
tennis used to make you?

01:09:30.859 --> 01:09:32.925
This could be your chance
to own that place.

01:09:32.926 --> 01:09:35.094
You already know
your way around real estate.

01:09:35.095 --> 01:09:37.162
What?
Mm-hm.

01:09:43.505 --> 01:09:47.506
All I wanted was a nice
glass of wine to celebrate.

01:09:50.178 --> 01:09:53.011
Fernando is really bouncy today.

01:09:53.014 --> 01:09:54.781
I play better hungover.

01:09:54.783 --> 01:09:57.984
I didn't realize they still
made Alabama Slammers.

01:09:57.986 --> 01:10:01.120
You had too many shots
last night.

01:10:01.122 --> 01:10:02.989
I couldn't have had
too many shots.

01:10:02.991 --> 01:10:06.058
The bartender's literally still
walking to our table with them.

01:10:10.665 --> 01:10:13.566
You kept talking
about buying this place.

01:10:15.003 --> 01:10:16.869
I was serious about that.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.207
You kept talking
about quitting Mason Agents.

01:10:21.209 --> 01:10:24.076
Were you serious about that?

01:10:24.078 --> 01:10:27.079
Hey. I'm very proud
of my Tuesday clinic,

01:10:27.081 --> 01:10:28.981
because now we're going
to play the finals

01:10:28.983 --> 01:10:30.950
against the Mason Agents.
Like, come on,

01:10:30.952 --> 01:10:33.953
whoever thought something like
this could happen? You know, I--

01:10:33.955 --> 01:10:36.856
I-- I-- I never win nothing.

01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:37.990
Oh, shit, really?

01:10:47.836 --> 01:10:49.569
Okay.

01:10:49.571 --> 01:10:51.871
Now we have work to do.
Why you looking at me?

01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:54.040
Some people are hitting
the ball late, okay?

01:10:54.042 --> 01:10:56.108
Remember that
the contact point is in front,

01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:58.077
so eyes to the front, okay?

01:10:58.079 --> 01:10:59.912
If you are to the side,

01:10:59.914 --> 01:11:03.082
you're gonna be hitting
the ball late. Okay, so...

01:11:05.019 --> 01:11:06.853
That's what
we shouldn't do, right?

01:11:06.855 --> 01:11:09.255
Just do the first one.
Okay. Baselines.

01:11:12.627 --> 01:11:14.694
To think... Wow!

01:11:15.763 --> 01:11:18.498
Wow! Champions! Ha!

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.867
Look at my team of winners, ha!

01:11:20.869 --> 01:11:23.035
Champions of the world!

01:11:23.037 --> 01:11:26.973
I'm very proud of you guys,
just so you know.

01:11:26.975 --> 01:11:28.774
Okay. So remember, CeeCee,

01:11:28.776 --> 01:11:31.077
you have to
hit the ball to front.

01:11:31.079 --> 01:11:33.980
Maybe... Maybe try to say it
out loud, okay?

01:11:33.982 --> 01:11:36.782
Contact point, ha!
Contact point, ha!

01:11:36.784 --> 01:11:39.051
Contact point!
You try. You try. Okay?

01:11:39.053 --> 01:11:40.553
Okay.

01:11:40.555 --> 01:11:42.555
Contact point.
Good!

01:11:42.557 --> 01:11:43.990
Again.

01:11:43.992 --> 01:11:46.125
Contact point!

01:11:48.062 --> 01:11:50.263
Contact point works!
Good job, CeeCee!

01:11:50.265 --> 01:11:52.732
Gracias!
Wow! Very good, CeeCee.

01:11:52.734 --> 01:11:53.933
Okay. Next?

01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:06.245
Madi, I hear
congratulations are in order.

01:12:06.247 --> 01:12:08.114
Somehow you made it

01:12:08.116 --> 01:12:11.584
into the Dick D Tournament
without <i> moi.</i>

01:12:11.586 --> 01:12:13.686
How did that happen?

01:12:13.688 --> 01:12:16.188
One minute we're partners,
and the next,

01:12:16.190 --> 01:12:19.759
I'm getting jazzed
to smash the shit out of you.

01:12:19.761 --> 01:12:21.727
Take a seat. Okay.

01:12:21.729 --> 01:12:23.195
I quit.

01:12:23.197 --> 01:12:25.064
Great. Love it.

01:12:25.066 --> 01:12:27.233
But before you leave, Madi,

01:12:27.235 --> 01:12:30.870
I just wanna say
a big, fat thank you.

01:12:30.872 --> 01:12:37.243
You see, I've been pursuing Dick
a long, long time.

01:12:37.245 --> 01:12:41.681
Mm-hm. I've been desperate
to get my hands on his house.

01:12:41.683 --> 01:12:44.717
And now, thanks to you, I do.

01:12:44.719 --> 01:12:47.019
You know, since you signed
the listing agreement

01:12:47.021 --> 01:12:48.654
as my employee.

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:51.691
Oh, but, ahem,
I haven't signed

01:12:51.693 --> 01:12:54.760
a listing agreement yet, so...

01:12:54.762 --> 01:12:57.163
you don't get Dick.

01:12:59.767 --> 01:13:01.968
Well played, ha.
That is a bummer.

01:13:03.237 --> 01:13:05.972
But lucky for me,

01:13:05.974 --> 01:13:10.910
you're not the only smart
cookie in the house, Madi Cooke.

01:13:10.912 --> 01:13:13.145
Yeah, that's right.
I know who you really are.

01:13:13.147 --> 01:13:14.981
But, um, ooh, question.

01:13:14.983 --> 01:13:17.850
Does Jackson know
that you're a gritless murderer

01:13:17.852 --> 01:13:19.051
of pygmy things?

01:13:19.053 --> 01:13:20.686
No, he doesn't, does he?

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:22.121
Tsk. Oh, dear.

01:13:22.123 --> 01:13:24.023
And does your, um...

01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:26.659
Does your team know
that you're a liar

01:13:26.661 --> 01:13:28.995
and a fraud and a loser?

01:13:28.997 --> 01:13:33.366
Ugh. I'm sorry.
This sucks...

01:13:33.368 --> 01:13:34.934
for you.

01:13:34.936 --> 01:13:36.068
Oh, Madi.

01:13:37.805 --> 01:13:39.872
But you know what?

01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:43.342
I actually know how you feel.

01:13:43.344 --> 01:13:45.311
Yeah. Believe it or not...

01:13:46.748 --> 01:13:48.214
...I used to be--

01:13:48.216 --> 01:13:50.116
God, a mess.

01:13:50.118 --> 01:13:53.953
I was just a walking, talking
bag of unforced errors.

01:13:53.955 --> 01:13:58.157
I was a loser,
a nightmare, a mess.

01:13:58.159 --> 01:14:01.260
I was just like you.
And now look at me.

01:14:01.262 --> 01:14:04.830
Pssh, God, winning's
so easy these days.

01:14:04.832 --> 01:14:08.067
It's almost boring
at this point.

01:14:08.069 --> 01:14:11.404
Which is why
I'm gonna give you a chance.

01:14:11.406 --> 01:14:13.372
I'm gonna
spice things up a little.

01:14:13.374 --> 01:14:15.307
Oh, yeah, this'll be fun.
Okay. Okay.

01:14:15.309 --> 01:14:17.276
So how about this?

01:14:17.278 --> 01:14:19.679
If you win the tournament,
which you won't,

01:14:19.681 --> 01:14:21.013
I'll keep your secret secret

01:14:21.015 --> 01:14:22.715
and you can sell Dick's mansion.

01:14:22.717 --> 01:14:24.050
But if I win, which I will,

01:14:24.052 --> 01:14:26.252
I get the listing
clean and simple.

01:14:26.254 --> 01:14:28.387
Ooh! Good one, Bobbi.

01:14:28.389 --> 01:14:31.057
Do we have a deal?

01:14:31.059 --> 01:14:33.693
Oh, and that clapping,
that's for me. Heh.

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:38.364
Okay. So we're gonna do a--

01:14:38.366 --> 01:14:40.066
A different type
of lesson today.

01:14:40.068 --> 01:14:41.934
We're gonna do
a lesson in positivity.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:45.004
Why you looking at me?
Okay, ask yourself

01:14:45.006 --> 01:14:49.875
why you play tennis.
Why do I play tennis?

01:14:49.877 --> 01:14:51.343
You or me?
You.

01:14:51.345 --> 01:14:53.479
'Cause you said both.
It's fun.

01:14:53.481 --> 01:14:55.147
Good. It's fun.
Why? Preeti?

01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:57.450
It's fun to belong to something.

01:14:57.452 --> 01:14:59.285
It's fun
to have someplace to go.

01:14:59.287 --> 01:15:01.854
It's kind of the same thing.
It's fun to hit something.

01:15:01.856 --> 01:15:03.956
It's fun not to go
to the gym instead.

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:05.791
It's fun being asked to play.

01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:07.960
But then, you know,
I'm never really playing,

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:10.763
'cause I'm just a sub.
Right. Madi?

01:15:10.765 --> 01:15:12.998
I should've quit weeks ago.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.435
Madi, no.
We can't win without you.

01:15:16.437 --> 01:15:18.337
If we don't win,
I lose everything.

01:15:18.339 --> 01:15:22.174
Yeah.
That's generally what happens,

01:15:22.176 --> 01:15:25.511
but we're gonna lose
together as a team.

01:15:26.948 --> 01:15:28.147
A team.

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:31.917
A team.

01:15:31.919 --> 01:15:33.452
A team, motherfucker.

01:15:33.454 --> 01:15:35.154
A team.

01:15:47.201 --> 01:15:48.400
A team.

01:15:50.538 --> 01:15:52.505
Okay.

01:15:52.507 --> 01:15:55.074
Let's rally. Okay?

01:15:55.076 --> 01:15:57.843
Um, Valentina, you and Madi.

01:15:57.845 --> 01:16:00.312
CeeCee and Preeti.
Ollie, you rotating,

01:16:00.314 --> 01:16:03.015
and, Jane, I have to give you
a word. Come on. Hands.

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:04.450
Oh, thank you.
Hands. Hands.

01:16:04.452 --> 01:16:05.918
Thanks, Fernando.
Good job.

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.386
Am I still saying <i> l'oeuf?</i>

01:16:07.388 --> 01:16:09.822
Fernando, I tell you,
I don't even realize this.

01:16:09.824 --> 01:16:12.858
Jane, I am sorry. Um...

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:16.428
It's kind of hard for me to say.

01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:18.531
You know you just...
"Lou," right?

01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:21.000
The name Lou,
and you put an F at the end.

01:16:21.002 --> 01:16:23.235
<i>L'oeuf. L'oeuf</i> actually. Ha-ha!

01:16:23.237 --> 01:16:26.972
It's-- So, Jane,
it's 35 years and older

01:16:26.974 --> 01:16:30.109
and up to 50 to play in
the tournament of Dick Duncan.

01:16:30.111 --> 01:16:32.344
I double-checked the rule book.

01:16:32.346 --> 01:16:34.980
The Mason Agents,
they're not gonna let you play.

01:16:34.982 --> 01:16:36.315
Have you told CeeCee?

01:16:36.317 --> 01:16:38.217
I'm gonna put
Valentina with CeeCee

01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:40.820
and Ollie with Madi
since they used to be partners.

01:16:40.822 --> 01:16:42.588
Yeah, but, I mean,
have you told CeeCee?

01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:45.157
Because, you know,
she gets all up in her head.

01:16:45.159 --> 01:16:46.458
I think that's gonna be

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:48.360
the second most
difficult conversation

01:16:48.362 --> 01:16:50.129
I'm gonna have today.

01:16:51.299 --> 01:16:52.565
I'm so sorry, Jane.

01:16:52.567 --> 01:16:54.433
But-- Hey, but there's no rules

01:16:54.435 --> 01:16:57.369
against having you as a sub,
and we're required to have one.

01:16:57.371 --> 01:17:00.039
You know, Fernando,
I've been playing tennis

01:17:00.041 --> 01:17:03.542
for over 30 years, and I may
have slowed down a bit,

01:17:03.544 --> 01:17:06.111
but I plan on playing
for another 30,

01:17:06.113 --> 01:17:11.317
so I guess this one
really won't matter, will it?

01:17:11.319 --> 01:17:13.886
That's very mature of you, Jane.
Really?!

01:17:13.888 --> 01:17:17.056
Are you trying to be funny?

01:17:30.504 --> 01:17:32.872
We couldn't have made it
into the tournament

01:17:32.874 --> 01:17:35.140
without you, Jane.

01:17:35.142 --> 01:17:37.343
You're my best player.

01:17:40.014 --> 01:17:41.480
Team.

01:17:41.482 --> 01:17:43.048
Team.

01:17:52.326 --> 01:17:53.359
Mr. Lee?

01:17:54.595 --> 01:17:56.095
Mr. Lee?

01:17:56.097 --> 01:17:57.329
Oh, God!

01:17:57.331 --> 01:18:00.165
Dude! What is up with that?

01:18:00.167 --> 01:18:02.167
That is not
a good customer experience.

01:18:02.169 --> 01:18:03.936
No returns.
Oh, no.

01:18:03.938 --> 01:18:06.171
I'm not here
to return the unitard.

01:18:06.173 --> 01:18:08.574
No, no. It's--
It's distinctive. I dig it.

01:18:08.576 --> 01:18:10.910
Actually, I'm here
to look for some uniforms

01:18:10.912 --> 01:18:12.144
for my tennis team.

01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:15.314
We need to look professional...

01:18:15.316 --> 01:18:17.116
but intimidating.

01:18:17.118 --> 01:18:18.918
You know what I mean?
That mask is--

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.520
What is that mask?
It's a baby.

01:18:21.522 --> 01:18:23.088
It's horrifying.

01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:24.456
Everybody loves babies.

01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:26.926
Oh, no. No, not everyone.

01:18:28.095 --> 01:18:30.462
Actually, how much is it?

01:18:30.464 --> 01:18:32.264
I cannot sell at any price.

01:18:32.266 --> 01:18:34.233
What about borrowing it?

01:18:34.235 --> 01:18:35.634
Hm.

01:18:42.276 --> 01:18:44.443
I'm nervous.

01:18:44.445 --> 01:18:49.381
I remember playing here as kids,
but it just seems fancier today.

01:18:49.383 --> 01:18:52.284
We never played here as kids.

01:18:52.286 --> 01:18:56.522
I know.
Just checking you for dementia.

01:18:58.526 --> 01:18:59.992
Ready?

01:18:59.994 --> 01:19:02.494
Please don't say,
"Let's do this."

01:19:02.496 --> 01:19:05.230
Okay. You ready?

01:19:07.335 --> 01:19:08.334
Yeah.

01:19:09.603 --> 01:19:11.236
Let's do this.

01:19:26.454 --> 01:19:28.754
Their tops are really cute.
Mm-hm.

01:19:28.756 --> 01:19:31.323
Ladies, team talk.

01:19:31.325 --> 01:19:32.992
I want you to play every game

01:19:32.994 --> 01:19:35.294
like your lives and jobs
depend on it.

01:19:35.296 --> 01:19:37.029
We can hear you.

01:19:37.031 --> 01:19:38.731
Like, this doesn't do anything.

01:19:38.733 --> 01:19:40.065
I gotta pee.

01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:42.067
I already did at home.

01:20:10.664 --> 01:20:12.564
My God!

01:20:14.035 --> 01:20:15.567
Oh, my God, Valentina!

01:20:15.569 --> 01:20:17.603
She Tonya Harding-ed herself.

01:20:17.605 --> 01:20:20.372
She Tonya Harding-ed herself.

01:20:20.374 --> 01:20:22.241
She's really hurt!
Oh, God!

01:20:22.243 --> 01:20:23.609
Hope she can still play.

01:20:23.611 --> 01:20:27.446
Somebody call a sub!
Bring me a sub!

01:20:30.418 --> 01:20:31.483
Mine!

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.787
Got it!

01:20:34.789 --> 01:20:36.522
Move it, Rosey!

01:20:37.758 --> 01:20:41.093
Oops. That was out, sweetheart.

01:20:41.095 --> 01:20:43.829
I'm sorry.
Don't start that "sorry" shit.

01:20:43.831 --> 01:20:47.099
Take a second. Look at
your strings. Remember?

01:20:47.101 --> 01:20:49.368
Controlled aggression.

01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:52.271
Get your racquet back sooner.
Just like high school.

01:20:52.273 --> 01:20:53.739
Yeah, but we won
in high school.

01:20:53.741 --> 01:20:55.441
"We won in high school."

01:20:55.443 --> 01:20:58.177
<i>Contact point. Contact point.</i>

01:20:58.179 --> 01:21:00.746
- Stop it!
- <i>Contact point!</i>

01:21:00.748 --> 01:21:03.549
<i>Contact point!</i>
Valentina, tell them to stop it

01:21:03.551 --> 01:21:06.452
Stop saying "contact point"
out loud, CeeCee!

01:21:06.454 --> 01:21:08.554
They're trying
to get in your head.

01:21:14.395 --> 01:21:16.829
Bam, motherfucker.
There's your contact point!

01:21:18.799 --> 01:21:21.300
Excuse me, ma'am.
They must've heard you curse.

01:21:21.302 --> 01:21:24.670
Oh, what's going on?
Oh, my gosh!

01:21:24.672 --> 01:21:26.805
We have reason
to believe these are yours.

01:21:26.807 --> 01:21:28.774
Wait. Where did you find those?

01:21:28.776 --> 01:21:30.209
This is bullshit.

01:21:30.211 --> 01:21:32.478
There's no doping
in tennis. Ever.

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.612
We're not animals.

01:21:33.614 --> 01:21:35.581
Slowly put down the racquet

01:21:35.583 --> 01:21:37.749
and come with us, Scary Spice.

01:21:39.153 --> 01:21:41.353
This has to be a joke.

01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:42.688
We never kid about drugs,

01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:47.259
especially our children's
drugs, Goldfarb.

01:21:47.261 --> 01:21:49.495
What? How do you know my name?
Keep moving.

01:21:49.497 --> 01:21:52.798
Jane, attack
the blond one's backhand,

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.134
and keep this bitch away.
Will you move?

01:21:55.136 --> 01:21:56.802
Yeah, yeah, I heard you.

01:21:56.804 --> 01:21:59.605
Drugs are bad.

01:21:59.607 --> 01:22:02.741
I guess subs aren't allowed
first one in, huh?

01:22:02.743 --> 01:22:05.410
No, mom, they're not.

01:22:05.412 --> 01:22:08.881
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I call you mom?

01:22:08.883 --> 01:22:12.251
You look just like my mother.
Oh...

01:22:12.253 --> 01:22:14.186
What's that score, CeeCee?

01:22:14.188 --> 01:22:15.687
Thirty-love.

01:22:18.459 --> 01:22:20.225
Thirty-l'oeuf!

01:22:28.869 --> 01:22:31.937
Forty-l'oeuf!

01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:38.310
Grace, what are you doing?

01:22:38.312 --> 01:22:39.578
You're sucking!
I'm sorry.

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.713
Okay. Just keep your eye
on the ball.

01:22:41.715 --> 01:22:44.249
Follow through and hit
inside out if you have to.

01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:45.918
There wasn't time
for inside out.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.619
Let's go!

01:22:51.425 --> 01:22:53.492
Out! That was out!

01:22:54.695 --> 01:22:55.761
It's too tight.

01:22:57.331 --> 01:22:58.897
Stop it!

01:22:58.899 --> 01:23:01.433
I'm sorry. I shouldn't laugh.
I'm trying not to.

01:23:09.710 --> 01:23:11.710
Stop it! It's not funny!

01:23:11.712 --> 01:23:14.213
I'm sorry. You're right.
I will not do it again.

01:23:14.215 --> 01:23:15.847
It is not funny.

01:23:17.251 --> 01:23:18.984
The advantage is in.

01:23:22.723 --> 01:23:25.290
<i>I study successful
people, Madi.</i>

01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:28.727
<i>You're not a successful person.</i>

01:23:28.729 --> 01:23:30.762
<i>Winning isn't everything.</i>

01:23:30.764 --> 01:23:35.701
<i>No. No, for you, Madi,
losing is everything.</i>

01:23:38.405 --> 01:23:40.405
Take that, bitch.

01:23:40.407 --> 01:23:41.640
And that.

01:23:43.644 --> 01:23:45.844
Oops! That's out! That's out!

01:23:45.846 --> 01:23:48.013
What the hell?
Sorry.

01:23:48.015 --> 01:23:50.682
No. The screaming.

01:23:50.684 --> 01:23:53.485
Who never had kids?
Who never had kids?

01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:57.289
I didn't. I didn't.
I didn't have kids.

01:23:57.291 --> 01:24:00.025
Rosey, have you brought
Bjِrn Borg to the grand finale?

01:24:00.027 --> 01:24:01.793
Have you lost your mind?

01:24:01.795 --> 01:24:03.996
You know I can't stand babies,
especially crying ones.

01:24:03.998 --> 01:24:05.764
Philip's holding her
in the stands.

01:24:05.766 --> 01:24:07.799
I wasn't allowed to cry
when I was a kid.

01:24:07.801 --> 01:24:10.035
That sound is triggering.
I need you to shut it down.

01:24:10.037 --> 01:24:12.037
She's hungry.
I'm gonna go feed her.

01:24:12.039 --> 01:24:14.573
I'm sick to death
of your breastfeeding excuses.

01:24:14.575 --> 01:24:16.408
How long with this madness, huh?

01:24:16.410 --> 01:24:17.943
What? Another two, three weeks?

01:24:17.945 --> 01:24:19.811
Nothing about that
in the rule book.

01:24:22.283 --> 01:24:24.549
Remember what I said
about hitting inside out.

01:24:24.551 --> 01:24:27.686
They are so obviously hammering
your weakling backhand.

01:24:27.688 --> 01:24:29.788
It couldn't be more obvious.

01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:32.924
Oh.
And stop meowing!

01:24:38.432 --> 01:24:41.633
<i>L'oeuf...</i> I mean 5-40.

01:24:44.038 --> 01:24:45.604
Psst!

01:24:45.606 --> 01:24:47.372
I can't hit it if I don't meow.

01:24:47.374 --> 01:24:49.308
Come on, Grace!

01:24:52.713 --> 01:24:54.313
Run, Jane, run!

01:24:57.751 --> 01:24:59.351
We won!
Whoo!

01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:02.754
Your spot! Your spot!

01:25:02.756 --> 01:25:04.356
That's your ball!
You suck!

01:25:04.358 --> 01:25:06.058
Oh, you suck. I hate you!
You're mean.

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:08.093
You suck. You're mean.
You made us lose.

01:25:08.095 --> 01:25:09.728
Oh, blegh! I can do that too.

01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:15.901
Hey! Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:25:17.805 --> 01:25:20.839
We won 20 games! They have 21!

01:25:22.443 --> 01:25:24.710
Holy shit!

01:25:24.712 --> 01:25:27.946
Plus our games, we can
pull off a big upset, Madi.

01:25:27.948 --> 01:25:30.382
We could kick ass
just like the old days.

01:25:30.384 --> 01:25:33.919
I suck. I'm making
so many unforced errors.

01:25:33.921 --> 01:25:36.621
What is wrong with me?

01:25:36.623 --> 01:25:39.458
Your racquet's open, and
you're getting under the ball.

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:42.060
Worse than that, where the hell
is your confidence?

01:25:42.062 --> 01:25:43.895
I was being rhetorical.

01:25:45.566 --> 01:25:47.432
Have you forgotten
what we called you

01:25:47.434 --> 01:25:50.502
in high school? Mad Madi?

01:25:50.504 --> 01:25:52.938
You were fierce on the court.

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:55.040
Don't you remember?

01:25:55.042 --> 01:25:57.142
Oh, um, I remembered something.

01:25:57.144 --> 01:25:58.810
As a sponsor of the local news,

01:25:58.812 --> 01:26:00.712
I insisted they cover
the tournament.

01:26:00.714 --> 01:26:04.049
So just a heads up,
everyone's gonna see you lose.

01:26:06.086 --> 01:26:07.919
I hate her.

01:26:07.921 --> 01:26:10.122
That should piss you off.

01:26:10.124 --> 01:26:11.890
Come on.

01:26:11.892 --> 01:26:14.025
It's you and me like old times.

01:26:16.096 --> 01:26:19.598
Back when grit was just the shit
that got in your eyes.

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:22.467
And when you lost confidence,
what would you do?

01:26:25.172 --> 01:26:27.572
Take hers.

01:26:27.574 --> 01:26:29.775
So, what are you waiting for?

01:26:35.949 --> 01:26:37.048
Chin up, Madi.

01:26:37.050 --> 01:26:38.917
This will all be over soon,

01:26:38.919 --> 01:26:41.887
and then you can go back
to being nothing.

01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:45.991
Rosey, open your eyes.

01:26:47.795 --> 01:26:49.694
Take hers.

01:26:53.734 --> 01:26:55.667
Take your time.

01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:08.980
Rosey, Bjِrn Borg is
crying again.

01:27:08.982 --> 01:27:11.183
That's not Bjorn Borg.
What?

01:27:15.722 --> 01:27:18.056
Okay. Nothing. It's a man.

01:27:18.058 --> 01:27:21.126
Nothing. No, it's...

01:27:21.128 --> 01:27:25.897
Okay. Serve. Serve. Serve!

01:27:25.899 --> 01:27:28.066
Each team's winning games
have been tallied.

01:27:28.068 --> 01:27:31.169
And, yes, it's come down
to an unlikely tie.

01:27:31.171 --> 01:27:34.739
A brutal seven-point tiebreaker
is now underway.

01:27:34.741 --> 01:27:37.476
And the clock is still ticking.

01:27:37.478 --> 01:27:39.978
I was told all play must stop
with the buzzer.

01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:41.613
And the team
with the most points

01:27:41.615 --> 01:27:43.582
wins the deciding game.
Got it! Die!

01:27:43.584 --> 01:27:45.951
It is a pressure cooker...
Die again! Fuck!

01:27:45.953 --> 01:27:48.186
...like no other.

01:27:57.965 --> 01:28:00.599
Aah! Out! Out!

01:28:00.601 --> 01:28:02.567
It was... It was out!

01:28:04.505 --> 01:28:06.638
- That wasn't out, was it?
- Oh, my God!

01:28:08.175 --> 01:28:09.674
Oh, my God.

01:28:09.676 --> 01:28:13.011
I won! I won! I won!

01:28:13.013 --> 01:28:15.947
Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry, Madi.

01:28:15.949 --> 01:28:18.817
I hope you weren't counting
on that trophy

01:28:18.819 --> 01:28:21.019
or a big Dick Duncan commission,

01:28:21.021 --> 01:28:23.221
because guess what?

01:28:23.223 --> 01:28:24.856
I got it.

01:28:24.858 --> 01:28:28.793
I got it. I won. I got it.

01:28:28.795 --> 01:28:33.298
Proved all those doubters wrong.
I fucking got it!

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:36.835
We won! We won, Rosey. We did.

01:28:36.837 --> 01:28:39.170
Why do you look so sad?

01:28:39.172 --> 01:28:42.841
Okay. Sure. Fuck, yeah.

01:28:42.843 --> 01:28:47.779
Hey! Hey! I won! I-- I just won.

01:28:47.781 --> 01:28:50.115
Hello? I won.

01:28:50.117 --> 01:28:51.683
What the fuck?

01:28:55.956 --> 01:28:59.124
Rosey! What? No.

01:28:59.126 --> 01:29:01.593
No, no, no, no, no.
I-- I was--

01:29:01.595 --> 01:29:03.962
I was a foot away from the ball.
I saw the ball.

01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:05.764
It-- It was out.

01:29:05.766 --> 01:29:07.666
It looks like
the Acme Spice Girls

01:29:07.668 --> 01:29:09.167
are challenging the call.

01:29:09.169 --> 01:29:11.636
What is going on?
I'm proud to announce

01:29:11.638 --> 01:29:13.805
that Elite is
the only private club

01:29:13.807 --> 01:29:15.707
in the beautiful
state of Connecticut

01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:17.943
to offer the Eagle Eye
line-calling system.

01:29:17.945 --> 01:29:19.244
When you play at Elite,

01:29:19.246 --> 01:29:20.845
it's like
you're playing at Wimbledon.

01:29:20.847 --> 01:29:23.081
We-- We won!

01:29:24.585 --> 01:29:26.117
But check it. I'm cool.

01:29:26.119 --> 01:29:28.153
Let's check it. Fine.

01:29:34.861 --> 01:29:36.061
<i>In.</i>

01:29:39.733 --> 01:29:42.300
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:29:42.302 --> 01:29:44.069
Yeah! Yeah!

01:29:48.241 --> 01:29:51.009
That's what I'm talking about!
That's what I'm talking about!

01:29:51.011 --> 01:29:53.812
That's what I say!
That's what I say!

01:29:53.814 --> 01:29:55.146
That's what I say!

01:29:55.148 --> 01:29:59.618
<i>Acme! Acme! Acme!</i>

01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:02.253
You need to do it again.

01:30:02.255 --> 01:30:04.022
You need to do it again!

01:30:04.024 --> 01:30:06.625
Do it again. Do it again!

01:30:06.627 --> 01:30:10.061
No! This is mine!
This is my trophy!

01:30:10.063 --> 01:30:12.998
Come here! Rosey, help me!

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.099
Give me that trophy!

01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:32.651
I was hoping I'd see you
before I locked up.

01:30:32.653 --> 01:30:34.686
This is the last of it.

01:30:34.688 --> 01:30:35.987
Nice.

01:30:38.425 --> 01:30:40.191
Congratulations again.

01:30:42.663 --> 01:30:45.063
Congratulations to you,
Madi Cooke.

01:30:45.065 --> 01:30:46.798
It's true
I didn't know my father,

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.700
but I have a feeling
he would've liked you.

01:30:48.702 --> 01:30:52.137
Hm, why is that?
He would've said you have grit.

01:30:52.139 --> 01:30:55.240
Ha-ha-ha, I'm just kidding.

01:31:03.984 --> 01:31:08.420
Ta-da!
We are the proud new owners

01:31:08.422 --> 01:31:11.756
of Acme Indoor Tennis.

01:31:11.758 --> 01:31:13.391
Remember the hours
we used to spend

01:31:13.393 --> 01:31:16.895
hitting against this wall?
Yeah. Crazy, right?

01:31:16.897 --> 01:31:20.065
We're really doing this?
No,<i> we</i> are not doing this.

01:31:20.067 --> 01:31:22.167
You are.
I'm a silent partner, remember?

01:31:22.169 --> 01:31:24.969
I'm barely settled back into
There's No Place Like Home,

01:31:24.971 --> 01:31:28.139
and already I have
like nine new listings.

01:31:28.141 --> 01:31:31.710
I can't believe Dick Duncan
owned this place.

01:31:33.747 --> 01:31:35.113
Thank you...

01:31:36.316 --> 01:31:38.149
silent partner.

01:31:38.151 --> 01:31:40.485
Thank you...

01:31:40.487 --> 01:31:42.053
non-silent partner.

01:31:44.257 --> 01:31:46.891
Should we change the name?

01:31:46.893 --> 01:31:49.994
No, I kind of like Acme.

01:31:49.996 --> 01:31:54.165
It means the pinnacle,
the highest point.

01:31:54.167 --> 01:31:57.302
Hm. Kind of makes me think
of the Road Runner cartoon.

01:31:57.304 --> 01:31:59.037
No. No.
No?

01:32:21.528 --> 01:32:23.762
You suck at this game.

01:32:23.764 --> 01:32:26.397
Hey, you only live once.

01:32:26.399 --> 01:32:28.032
But you get to serve twice.

01:32:28.034 --> 01:32:30.001
Oh, gross. Gross.

01:32:35.175 --> 01:32:37.909
What are you doing? I thought
you were good at tennis.

01:32:37.911 --> 01:32:39.344
Hm.

01:32:39.346 --> 01:32:41.346
Whoo!

01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:44.783
Hey!

01:32:46.453 --> 01:32:48.953
Whoo!

01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:57.128
<i>Is fear of not winning
anymore keeping you from your game?</i>

01:32:57.130 --> 01:32:59.397
<i>If you suffer from
fear of not winning anymore,</i>

01:32:59.399 --> 01:33:03.535
<i>commonly known as FONWA,
now there's a choice.</i>

01:33:03.537 --> 01:33:05.503
<i>Proform-X is clinically proven</i>

01:33:05.505 --> 01:33:07.372
<i>to significantly improve
wins over losses</i>

01:33:07.374 --> 01:33:09.507
<i>in some people in all sports.</i>

01:33:09.509 --> 01:33:12.877
Not long ago, I learned
that I suffer from FONWA,

01:33:12.879 --> 01:33:14.813
making it difficult
to form sentences

01:33:14.815 --> 01:33:16.881
when I lose tennis match.

01:33:16.883 --> 01:33:21.085
But, ooh, golly, does
Proform-X make me feel jolly.

01:33:27.561 --> 01:33:30.295
<i>Pregnant or nursing women
should never take Proform-X,</i>

01:33:30.297 --> 01:33:33.231
<i>as it can lead
to gastronomy and babies.</i>

01:33:33.233 --> 01:33:35.266
<i>Do not take Proform-X
with any other medications,</i>

01:33:35.268 --> 01:33:37.869
<i>as this may bring on
rare but serious side effects,</i>

01:33:37.871 --> 01:33:39.437
<i>like spontaneous jumping.</i>

01:33:39.439 --> 01:33:41.472
<i>Proform-X is not
a substitute for practice.</i>

01:33:41.474 --> 01:33:43.007
<i>May cause death or eye pain.</i>

01:33:43.009 --> 01:33:45.343
I've been on Proform-X
