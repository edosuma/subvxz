She (bleep) splashed
that (bleep) in my face,

07:49.402 --> 07:50.770
and I'm the only mother(bleep)

07:50.837 --> 07:54.106
{\an1}that ever cared about her
in this house.

07:54.173 --> 07:55.708
{\an8}Surprise, mother(bleep)!

07:55.775 --> 07:59.212
{\an8}I am the only one that has
their sanity right now.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.480
(Codi sobbing)

08:01.547 --> 08:04.183
{\an1}(Kirk)
Oh, pan fried rice.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.751
What's good,<i> Dirk?</i>

08:05.818 --> 08:07.153
(clears throat)

08:07.220 --> 08:08.254
First off,
you're not leaving.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.689
{\an4}Yes, I am.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.689
Let me be real with you.

08:09.755 --> 08:11.057
It was all my fault.

08:11.123 --> 08:12.825
On everything,
even at Tootsie's.

08:12.892 --> 08:15.094
I think there's
a misunderstanding.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.029
{\an1}It might be
a misunderstanding,

08:17.096 --> 08:18.130
{\an1}but you wanna know
something?

08:18.197 --> 08:20.333
{\an1}Gus and Jeremiah
took no effort

08:20.399 --> 08:21.801
{\an1}to understand
where I was coming from.

08:21.868 --> 08:23.970
But my thing is that
I'm trying to make sure

08:24.036 --> 08:25.071
you all right.

08:25.137 --> 08:26.606
{\an1}No, I feel you,
and I appreciate that,

08:26.672 --> 08:27.974
and when it comes to me,

08:28.040 --> 08:30.276
I already know you got me
and I love you for that.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.410
{\an6}So...

08:30.343 --> 08:32.410
{\an1}But like I say,
I'm, I'm down here

08:32.477 --> 08:34.746
{\an1}to talk
about those other two.

08:34.813 --> 08:36.482
I can listen
to Jeremiah explain

08:36.549 --> 08:37.683
before I'll listen to Gus.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.485
{\an1}Then why don't you and him
talk, at least?

08:39.552 --> 08:40.852
I don't know how--

08:40.919 --> 08:42.455
I don't know if I can
talk to Gus after this.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.658
{\an5}Screw today!

08:42.520 --> 08:45.658
(door slams)

08:45.725 --> 08:49.595
Oh, God, did stuff happen
with them too?

08:49.662 --> 08:51.731
{\an5}(Candace)
What happened?

08:49.662 --> 08:51.731
{\an1}Someone's gonna get
their ass kicked.

08:51.797 --> 08:52.899
But what happened?

08:52.965 --> 08:54.467
{\an1}Nilsa threw a drink
in his face.

08:54.533 --> 08:55.868
{\an5}Why?

08:54.533 --> 08:55.868
{\an3}Why?

08:55.935 --> 08:57.837
{\an8}(sighs)

08:57.904 --> 08:59.472
(Kirk)
Don't cry about it.

08:59.538 --> 09:02.041
I'm not, I'm not... I don't,
I don't wanna cry about it.

09:02.108 --> 09:04.744
{\an5}(Kirk)
That's why you're
(bleep) crying? Really?

09:04.810 --> 09:06.379
Do you realize the night I had?

09:06.445 --> 09:07.914
{\an5}(Candace)
You don't know why
she threw a drink at you?

09:07.980 --> 09:10.116
{\an4}No, I really don't.
I don't (bleep) know,
I don't remember.

09:10.182 --> 09:12.485
{\an5}(Candace)
This night just keep getting
worse and worse.

09:12.551 --> 09:13.719
{\an8}Does this ever end?

09:13.786 --> 09:14.887
{\an8}Oh, my God.

09:14.954 --> 09:16.355
Where is Nilsa now?

09:16.422 --> 09:18.925
(Aimee)
Gotta go. We have to go.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.393
{\an5}I'm gonna push you.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.393
I gotta pee.

09:20.459 --> 09:22.194
No, no, no, Nilsa,
it's time to go.

09:22.261 --> 09:24.997
Oh...

09:25.064 --> 09:27.066
I mean, please let me out
that side. I gotta pee.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.467
Don't, you're drunk.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.569
Oh, God, I'm gonna have
to pee in this... hold this.

09:30.636 --> 09:33.906
{\an5}Sorry, Nilsa.

09:30.636 --> 09:33.906
Oh, God...

09:33.973 --> 09:35.241
(Nilsa urinating)

09:35.308 --> 09:37.476
{\an1}Oh, my God
What the (bleep)?

09:37.543 --> 09:38.911
Aw...

09:38.978 --> 09:40.179
(Aimee)
Nilsa is so drunk,

09:40.246 --> 09:43.683
she's pissing in
the middle console of the taxi.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.819
{\an8}What the (bleep)?

09:46.886 --> 09:49.588
Oh... (chuckling).

09:49.655 --> 09:51.958

Oh, sn...

09:55.895 --> 09:57.863

09:57.930 --> 10:00.066
{\an8}Oops.

10:00.132 --> 10:03.202

situation going on.

10:08.574 --> 10:11.811
Oh, dear God.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.813

10:11.877 --> 10:13.813
Oh, Lord, help me.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.614

10:13.879 --> 10:15.614
Come here.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.183
{\an5}So, explain.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.183
I don't know.

10:17.249 --> 10:19.085
{\an4}Explain why she threw
a drink at him.

10:17.249 --> 10:19.085
He says he doesn't know.

10:19.151 --> 10:20.286
Why is he sitting on my bed?

10:20.353 --> 10:22.421
{\an5}Oh, I forgot.
Oh, (bleep).

10:20.353 --> 10:22.421
{\an3}Why?

10:22.488 --> 10:23.856
{\an5}Come here, sit--

10:22.488 --> 10:23.856
I'm not worried about...

10:23.923 --> 10:25.458
{\an1}I'm gonna address what I was--
what we were talking about.

10:25.524 --> 10:27.093
{\an1}But she was saying--
No, hold, hold up.

10:27.159 --> 10:29.295
{\an4}Stop.

10:27.159 --> 10:29.295
{\an3}Can I go?

10:29.362 --> 10:30.663
{\an5}No, stop, listen.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.663
Can I go?

10:30.730 --> 10:32.098
{\an5}Are you serious?
Are you serious?

10:30.730 --> 10:32.098
{\an3}Can I go?

10:32.164 --> 10:33.866
{\an4}No--

10:32.164 --> 10:33.866
I'm dead serious.
I wanna go.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.468
All I got to--
I don't--

10:35.534 --> 10:36.802
I respect everybody
in letting them talk,

10:36.869 --> 10:37.937
and then I can't even talk.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.105
Because at the end of the day,

10:39.171 --> 10:41.340
he didn't even listen,
hear me out.

10:41.407 --> 10:43.476
{\an5}So I have nothing to say to him.

10:41.407 --> 10:43.476
{\an1}No, no, that's why I--
no, that's what I mean--

10:43.542 --> 10:44.777
{\an1}(Candace)
No, it doesn't matter.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.178
{\an5}You kept pulling me away--

10:44.844 --> 10:46.178
Okay, y'all talk it out.

10:46.245 --> 10:48.748
{\an1}--without letting me
explain myself.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.117
{\an1}I got upset
because in my eyes,

10:51.183 --> 10:52.685
{\an1}it looks like
you're siding with the cops

10:52.752 --> 10:54.220
without hearing my side.

10:54.286 --> 10:56.222
{\an5}He, he did throw something.

10:54.286 --> 10:56.222
I know he did.

10:56.288 --> 10:57.823
{\an1}But they threw stuff
at us too.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.492
{\an5}It's fine,
it's not a big deal.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.492
And for you to agree with that

10:59.558 --> 11:00.760
{\an5}is bull(bleep).

10:59.558 --> 11:00.760
No, it's not.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.161
You didn't even give a...

11:02.228 --> 11:04.330
{\an1}You didn't even give me a chance
to let me explain to you

11:04.397 --> 11:05.998
{\an1}why I felt
the way that I felt.

11:06.065 --> 11:08.200
{\an1}But when the police officer
grabs me personally

11:08.267 --> 11:10.236
{\an1}and says, "We don't want
anything popping off in here,

11:10.302 --> 11:13.139
so will you please grab your
roommates and let them go?"

11:13.205 --> 11:15.641
Candace knows that my whole
family is police officers,

11:15.708 --> 11:17.910
so when you see your roommate

11:19.378 --> 11:21.347

24:52.757 --> 24:54.092
What's wrong?

24:54.159 --> 24:57.095
{\an1}Literally, I said,
"Can y'all please stop talking

24:57.162 --> 24:58.864
or go downstairs
while I'm on the phone?"

24:58.930 --> 25:00.999
{\an5}And I said, "Dude."
I'm like, literally,
"Logan is asking you."

25:01.066 --> 25:02.334
He doesn't get to talk to me.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.835
Just like how
you and (bleep) Gator

25:03.902 --> 25:05.737
{\an1}get to talk on the phone
whenever the (bleep) you want.

25:05.804 --> 25:07.939
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

25:05.804 --> 25:07.939
How come there
can't be respect?

25:08.006 --> 25:10.308
If it's not respecting me,
at least respect him

25:10.375 --> 25:11.610
that he's working

25:11.676 --> 25:13.979
and he's trying to talk
to his girlfriend.

25:14.045 --> 25:17.048
My roommates have never
been around me

25:17.115 --> 25:20.285
while I've been in a
relationship long-term, so...

25:20.352 --> 25:22.888
I don't think they're
taking it seriously.

25:22.954 --> 25:26.391
But if it's pissing off Logan,
it's pissing off me,

25:26.458 --> 25:29.194
because do I wanna deal with
Logan when he's pissed off? No.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.529
That's the one (bleep) person
that I wanna (bleep) talk to

25:31.596 --> 25:33.965
that keeps me (bleep) sane.

25:34.032 --> 25:36.501
Gator keeps me sane too.

25:36.568 --> 25:38.403
I understand
how Kortni feels.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.338
You know, it's hard

{\an1}Trust me, I know.
