WEBVTT

00:15.497 --> 00:16.521
Agents in position.

00:16.698 --> 00:17.790
You have the green light.

00:17.966 --> 00:19.092
Breach on my command.

00:19.267 --> 00:22.965
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:28.743 --> 00:29.938
I'm hit! I'm hit!

00:30.111 --> 00:31.601
- Cover me!
- Cover him!

00:44.726 --> 00:46.455
Man down!

00:53.868 --> 00:55.336
- I'm down!
- Push past.

00:55.503 --> 00:57.267
Code WIA, agents are down.

00:57.438 --> 00:59.998
- Agent Jenkins, status.
- Need a medic to transport.

01:00.175 --> 01:02.143
- Agent Jenkins?
- To the rooms!

01:02.310 --> 01:04.334
Check their weapons.

01:04.512 --> 01:06.981
Agent Jenkins, what
the hell just happened over there?

01:07.148 --> 01:08.411
What just happened, sir,

01:08.583 --> 01:11.450
is that you sent me
into a damn ambush.

01:43.885 --> 01:45.819
I just don't get kids these days.

01:45.987 --> 01:49.514
Deeks, you're not walking
on a treadmill at your desk.

01:49.691 --> 01:52.683
The nom préféré
is a walking workstation, thank you.

01:52.860 --> 01:54.851
- Don't call it that.
- How slow is that thing?

01:55.029 --> 01:56.895
It's humming along
at one mile per hour.

01:57.065 --> 01:59.193
So that way
I can still type and read,

01:59.367 --> 02:01.665
and even sip
my morning hazelnut latte.

02:01.836 --> 02:03.516
It's gonna take you an hour
to go one mile?

02:04.539 --> 02:06.439
- What's the point?
- The point, Mr. Callen,

02:06.608 --> 02:08.768
is that innocent-looking chair
sitting behind your desk

02:08.910 --> 02:10.435
is actually a silent killer.

02:10.612 --> 02:12.205
Is your hippie-dippy aunt
back in town?

02:12.380 --> 02:15.247
Aunt Barbara is actually not back
in town, but she did send an article.

02:15.416 --> 02:17.942
Did you guys know
that your muscles rot while you sit,

02:18.119 --> 02:20.247
and your good cholesterol
completely abandons you?

02:20.421 --> 02:21.752
Like your dignity right now?

02:21.923 --> 02:23.482
We get plenty of exercise
in the field.

02:23.658 --> 02:27.288
Uh-huh. But exercise does not reverse
chair-inflicted damage to your body.

02:27.462 --> 02:28.896
Are you hearing yourself?

02:29.063 --> 02:31.143
And studies have shown
that walking reduces your risk

02:31.299 --> 02:32.892
of heart disease
by 31 percent, and...

02:33.067 --> 02:35.798
And reduces the risk of death
by 32 percent.

02:36.304 --> 02:38.398
My protégé has arrived.

02:38.573 --> 02:39.938
"My protégé,” my ass.

02:40.108 --> 02:42.941
You said you'd shut up about all this
when you got that thingamaijig.

02:43.111 --> 02:44.943
This thingamajig
is gonna save all your lives,

02:45.113 --> 02:46.233
so you should just thank me.

02:46.381 --> 02:48.543
Save us from death by chair?

02:48.716 --> 02:50.946
- Suicide by sitting?
- Homicide by Herman Miller?

02:51.119 --> 02:53.554
Chairs, the silent killers.

02:53.721 --> 02:55.689
Okay, Kensilina,
you of all people should know

02:55.857 --> 02:58.918
that, uh, chairdom is especially
lethal for women.

02:59.093 --> 03:01.118
And Hetty actually agreed to this?

03:01.296 --> 03:03.890
"Agreed" is a strong word, Ms. Blye.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.365
Hetty, will you please
tell these, uh, nihilists

03:08.536 --> 03:10.300
that you support
my walking workstation?

03:11.005 --> 03:13.167
I'd rather you call it something else.

03:14.008 --> 03:15.476
Yeah, but you said I could have one.

03:15.643 --> 03:19.739
Yes, as long as it doesn't interfere
with everyone's work.

03:19.914 --> 03:22.781
It's not interfering with their work.

03:22.950 --> 03:26.079
They're just excited. They're
like untrained puppies with big paws.

03:26.254 --> 03:28.313
I know he didn't just call us dogs.

03:28.489 --> 03:29.923
No, it was worse. Puppies.

03:30.725 --> 03:32.659
Wanna take it for a spin?
Named her Madeleine.

03:35.129 --> 03:36.927
She is a Madeleine, indeed.

03:37.098 --> 03:39.829
What happened? Secretary Albright
lose one of your brooches again?

03:40.735 --> 03:43.170
It's much too upsetting to talk about.

03:43.338 --> 03:44.806
Fair enough.

03:44.972 --> 03:46.633
Now, everyone up to Ops.

03:46.808 --> 03:48.776
We have a case.

03:48.943 --> 03:52.811
And either the new SECNAV
is exceptionally paranoid,

03:52.980 --> 03:58.885
or this one could affect the entire
national-security infrastructure.

04:06.994 --> 04:08.257
Who are they?

04:08.429 --> 04:12.388
Well, the good guys are CIA,
FBI and NCIS.

04:12.567 --> 04:14.626
It was a counterterrorism
joint task force.

04:14.802 --> 04:16.394
- And the target?
- The Molina Cartel

04:16.571 --> 04:18.699
and their friends in al Qaeda.

04:18.873 --> 04:21.308
According to intelligence,
the Molina Cartel was planning

04:21.476 --> 04:23.672
to make another investment
in the terrorist group.

04:23.845 --> 04:26.212
This time, in exchange
for Afghan opium.

04:26.381 --> 04:28.816
A meet was supposed to
have taken place at this house.

04:29.350 --> 04:30.374
But let me guess.

04:30.551 --> 04:33.885
There was no opium
and no one there from al Qaeda.

04:34.055 --> 04:35.955
Just a bunch of cartel guys
with their guns.

04:36.124 --> 04:39.287
- Bad intel?
- That or somebody tipped them off.

04:39.460 --> 04:41.485
The new SECNAV
thinks there's a mole.

04:41.996 --> 04:43.828
Where? FBI? CIA?

04:43.998 --> 04:48.026
Could be there,
or it could be closer to home.

04:48.736 --> 04:49.760
NCIS?

04:51.773 --> 04:54.538
And we can't execute another
operation until the leak is plugged.

04:54.709 --> 04:55.938
Can't afford to.

04:56.110 --> 04:58.511
Hetty said SECNAV requested
this team specifically.

04:58.679 --> 05:01.671
Hmm. Where are the guys
who coordinated the operation?

05:01.849 --> 05:03.044
On their way to the boatshed.

05:03.217 --> 05:05.257
Have you started analyzing
their phones and laptops?

05:05.653 --> 05:08.281
- Already on it.
- Kensi, Deeks, talk to the agents.

05:08.456 --> 05:10.891
And don't let on that SECNAV
thinks there's a mole.

05:11.058 --> 05:12.082
Of course.

05:12.693 --> 05:13.785
How many didn't make it?

05:14.228 --> 05:15.354
Two, so far.

05:15.530 --> 05:17.794
There's another in the ICU
at St. John's.

05:34.081 --> 05:37.813
Think the neighbors had any idea
they were living next to a drug cartel?

05:37.985 --> 05:40.420
Like your neighbors have any idea
who they're living next to.

05:40.588 --> 05:41.783
Of course, they do.

05:41.956 --> 05:43.321
A handsome bachelor.

05:43.491 --> 05:46.290
Heh.
A quiet man who keeps to himself?

05:46.461 --> 05:48.429
Classic description of a serial killer.

05:48.596 --> 05:50.997
I happen to value my privacy,
and my neighbors respect that.

05:51.165 --> 05:53.133
Even the ones that write about you
in their blogs?

05:56.103 --> 05:59.038
Oh, yeah. "My Mysterious Stranger."

05:59.207 --> 06:02.268
- How did you...?
- I'm a special agent.

06:02.677 --> 06:04.304
They were supposed to
take that down.

06:04.479 --> 06:07.938
I can see Deeks getting himself
into something like this, but you?

06:08.115 --> 06:09.981
Look, her name is llyse,
and she's harmless.

06:10.151 --> 06:12.449
And I've...
I'm dealing with the situation.

06:12.620 --> 06:14.019
Oh, it's a situation?

06:14.188 --> 06:16.850
- I've got it under control.
- Not according to her blog.

06:17.024 --> 06:18.287
So stop reading her blog.

06:18.459 --> 06:20.339
You know she rescued an animal
she was afraid of

06:20.495 --> 06:22.224
just so she could impress you?

06:22.797 --> 06:24.026
Eric and Nell showed you.

06:24.198 --> 06:26.462
I'm just a sucker
for unrequited love stories.

06:26.634 --> 06:27.760
Don't judge.

06:27.935 --> 06:32.202
You know, you are big and strong
with striking blue eyes.

06:44.619 --> 06:46.781
That look like a barricade to you?

06:46.954 --> 06:48.012
Yeah.

06:48.189 --> 06:51.090
Looks like the Molina Cartel knew
our boys were coming.

06:51.392 --> 06:53.759
And they knew
when we were coming.

06:56.230 --> 06:58.790
They even knew the exact door
we were coming through.

06:59.534 --> 07:01.161
You're right.

07:01.602 --> 07:03.195
No barricade for the other entrance.

07:07.642 --> 07:09.872
G., SECNAV may be right.

07:10.044 --> 07:12.240
There may really be a mole.

07:16.517 --> 07:19.817
FBI Agent Jenkins,
FBI Agent Ambrose,

07:19.987 --> 07:24.720
CIA Agent Lowell,
and NCIS Agent Carter.

07:24.892 --> 07:27.259
Good to see you again.
Nose looks great.

07:27.428 --> 07:30.022
Oh, this is the agent you elbowed
in the face for the KO?

07:30.197 --> 07:32.689
- He was holding me against my will.
- Granger ordered me to.

07:32.867 --> 07:34.130
I was perfectly justified.

07:34.302 --> 07:37.272
I developed sleep apnea
thanks to Agent Blye.

07:37.438 --> 07:38.735
Damn deviated septum.

07:40.274 --> 07:42.436
So you geniuses
behind this morning's fiasco,

07:42.610 --> 07:44.237
who, uh, would like to go first?

07:44.412 --> 07:47.279
All right, look, I got the call
from Agent Ambrose

07:47.448 --> 07:50.713
with the operation details
three hours before my team went in.

07:50.885 --> 07:53.752
He gave me the green light,
and now two of them are dead

07:53.921 --> 07:55.446
and another one's in ICU.

07:56.190 --> 07:58.591
Agent Ambrose,
you gave the go-ahead?

07:58.759 --> 08:03.788
I'd just like to state for the record
that I followed protocol toa T.

08:04.465 --> 08:06.593
Oh, Agent Ambrose,
now I remember you.

08:06.767 --> 08:09.202
Why don't you give me a little taste?
Give me page 37,

08:09.370 --> 08:11.202
second paragraph from the bottom.

08:11.372 --> 08:13.534
Do not mock the FBI handbook.

08:13.708 --> 08:18.305
Ambrose, if you did follow protocol,
what went wrong?

08:18.479 --> 08:21.608
I don't appreciate your tone
or your implication.

08:21.782 --> 08:24.911
What you do or do not appreciate
is of no concern to me.

08:25.086 --> 08:28.317
I did everything I was supposed to do.
This is not on me, do you understand?

08:28.489 --> 08:32.119
And, Agent Jenkins, I will
have your ass for insubordination.

08:33.760 --> 08:34.990
Agent Lowell, any thoughts?

08:35.162 --> 08:38.222
I honestly have no idea
what happened.

08:38.399 --> 08:41.390
It was a smart, clean operation,
by the book, like Ambrose said.

08:42.770 --> 08:44.530
We had no reason to think
it was compromised.

08:45.006 --> 08:46.064
Eric, what is it?

08:46.240 --> 08:48.470
Kensi, SECNAV
may have been wrong.

08:48.643 --> 08:50.805
There's not a mole
at one of the agencies.

08:51.946 --> 08:52.970
Is it worse?

08:53.648 --> 08:55.446
Much worse.

08:55.616 --> 08:59.075
The CIA and the FBI
have been hacked.

09:13.333 --> 09:16.268
What makes you think
the CIA and FBI were hacked?

09:16.436 --> 09:17.870
Agent Lowell's cell phone.

09:19.105 --> 09:22.370
Whoever's responsible did a decent job
of covering up their tracks,

09:22.542 --> 09:24.032
but, come on, people,
let's be honest.

09:24.210 --> 09:28.511
You can run, but you cannot hide
from the E to the B to the T to the O.

09:28.681 --> 09:30.149
The E to the B-T-O?

09:31.317 --> 09:32.842
Eric Beale, Tech Operator.

09:33.019 --> 09:34.919
- Yep.
- Well, let's get to the point, E-bot.

09:35.088 --> 09:38.581
Right. Uh, I discovered
the hacker's malware program.

09:38.758 --> 09:42.922
- I'm sorry. What?
- Basically software created for evil.

09:43.930 --> 09:46.365
I found the same malware
on Agent Ambrose's phone.

09:47.333 --> 09:49.700
And this malware's what?
A virus? A worm?

09:49.869 --> 09:53.601
No, it's a program that converts
phone calls to text in real time,

09:53.773 --> 09:56.367
- totally undetected, super cool.
- Yeah.

09:56.542 --> 09:59.375
Except for the hacking
federal agencies part, obviously.

09:59.545 --> 10:02.014
What about the agents' computers?
Have they been compromised?

10:02.181 --> 10:04.081
I need time to be certain,
but they look clean.

10:04.617 --> 10:08.076
Things are gonna get uglier if the FBI
and CIA networks have been hacked.

10:08.254 --> 10:10.882
Right, so just to clarify,
the malware on the agents' phone

10:11.057 --> 10:14.254
enabled the Molina Cartel to intercept
details about this morning's raid?

10:14.427 --> 10:15.519
That's what it looks like.

10:15.695 --> 10:17.789
Okay, but if the agents
followed protocol,

10:17.964 --> 10:20.164
how did the cartel hack their phones
in the first place?

10:20.300 --> 10:23.361
Look, you have to understand that
no networked device is safe anymore.

10:23.536 --> 10:25.265
That's where we come in.

10:25.438 --> 10:28.567
Look, the truth is,
I don't know how they did it.

10:28.741 --> 10:31.142
Our best bet is if the hacker
used a cryptography key.

10:33.613 --> 10:35.513
- It's a digital signature.
- Thank you.

10:35.682 --> 10:38.947
Look, I can try to track down
his location, if he's online.

10:39.118 --> 10:40.838
He could be in the Ukraine,
for all we know.

10:40.987 --> 10:42.148
Figure it out.

10:42.322 --> 10:43.842
Let's take a closer look at these two.

10:43.990 --> 10:46.322
It's way too much of a coincidence
they were both hacked.

10:46.492 --> 10:48.688
I wouldn't mind tailing
Agent Ambrose for a bit.

10:48.861 --> 10:50.625
Dude was cagier
than a loaded weasel.

10:52.165 --> 10:53.963
What? They can get super cagey.

10:54.133 --> 10:56.261
- I never leave my weasel loaded.
- I bet you don't.

10:57.170 --> 10:58.370
Do I have to separate you two?

10:58.538 --> 11:00.438
Just keep an eye
on what Agent Ambrose is up to.

11:00.606 --> 11:02.246
- We'll look after Agent Lowell.
- Got it.

11:05.278 --> 11:08.111
What? Uh, no, you're welcome.
It was no sweat.

11:08.281 --> 11:10.841
I'm sure anyone could have identified
the malware this quickly.

11:11.017 --> 11:13.349
We still hear you talking, E-bot.

11:20.059 --> 11:21.151
I don't get it.

11:21.327 --> 11:22.692
What, the handlebar mustache?

11:22.862 --> 11:24.455
- Yeah.
- It's supposed to be ironic.

11:24.630 --> 11:26.962
Well, then he doesn't know
what "ironic" means.

11:27.133 --> 11:29.363
Personally I blame Alanis Morissette.

11:31.571 --> 11:34.165
- What?
- I gotta use the loo.

11:35.375 --> 11:36.536
Are you serious?

11:36.709 --> 11:38.429
I told you not to have
that third green tea.

11:38.578 --> 11:40.618
I needed the antioxidants.
I also need the caffeine.

11:40.747 --> 11:42.078
Wanna know why
I needed caffeine?

11:42.248 --> 11:44.342
Because I'm bored.
I'm bored, bored, bored.

11:44.517 --> 11:47.214
Because stakeouts are supposed
to promise scandal and intrigue.

11:47.387 --> 11:48.587
This guy doesn't even jaywalk.

11:48.755 --> 11:50.985
We've only been following him
for a couple hours.

11:51.157 --> 11:52.716
So why don't you be patient,
and quiet?

11:53.459 --> 11:54.483
Thank you.

11:54.660 --> 11:57.288
I can't believe he braved the elements
to eat lunch outside.

11:57.463 --> 11:59.423
Can't believe that barista
hasn't shaved that off.

11:59.565 --> 12:02.728
Okay, so then just to clarify,
the facial hair, not a turn-on for you?

12:02.902 --> 12:04.370
No, hardly ever.

12:04.537 --> 12:06.164
Which means sometimes maybe?

12:06.339 --> 12:07.738
Which means
maybe George Clooney.

12:07.907 --> 12:09.875
George Clooney? Really?

12:10.043 --> 12:11.602
Yeah, I like him. He's got a...

12:11.778 --> 12:13.337
His eyes sparkle.

12:13.513 --> 12:15.277
God, never been happier
to see you two.

12:15.448 --> 12:17.644
What's wrong?
Ambrose make you?

12:17.817 --> 12:20.946
Of course not. But the Vietnamese
nail salon across the street

12:21.120 --> 12:23.020
is practicing gender discrimination.

12:23.189 --> 12:25.419
Lady said the bathrooms
are women-only.

12:25.591 --> 12:27.525
Deeks needs to pee.

12:27.794 --> 12:29.023
Anything on Agent Lowell?

12:29.195 --> 12:31.357
In the office all day.
What about Ambrose?

12:31.531 --> 12:33.590
Went to work,
spent the morning at the office,

12:33.766 --> 12:36.531
and then drove down here
to eat his sad lunch alone.

12:37.336 --> 12:39.168
Oh, maybe not.

12:39.338 --> 12:40.601
We've got a woman.

12:40.773 --> 12:43.174
Actually, make that underage girl
approaching Ambrose.

12:44.077 --> 12:46.637
He's too young and she's too old
for that to be his daughter.

12:46.813 --> 12:49.282
And he is too old and she is too young
for anything else.

12:49.449 --> 12:53.579
Personally, I think the, uh, whole
schoolgirl uniform is a little bit cliché,

12:53.753 --> 12:56.415
but, you know, who am I to judge?

12:58.091 --> 12:59.252
Confirmed.

12:59.425 --> 13:02.451
Agent Ambrose does not
have a daughter or a stepdaughter,

13:02.628 --> 13:06.064
or a much, much younger sister.

13:06.232 --> 13:09.964
Straightest arrows always have
the most crooked kinks.

13:10.403 --> 13:12.770
- So who's the girl, Eric?
- Give me a minute.

13:14.707 --> 13:16.937
- Does the network seem slow to you?
- Nope.

13:17.110 --> 13:19.030
You don't think
there's, like, a drag wind on it?

13:19.178 --> 13:21.647
No, Goldilocks,
the network seems just right to me.

13:27.386 --> 13:30.287
- There you are.
- You found her?

13:30.456 --> 13:32.424
Guys, forget about the girl.

13:32.992 --> 13:35.120
The hacker just went online. Wait.

13:35.294 --> 13:37.922
That's crazy.
He's like two minutes away from you.

13:38.097 --> 13:39.565
Just head north.

13:39.732 --> 13:41.393
We're on our way.

13:50.810 --> 13:53.336
Okay, now turn left onto Rosewood.

13:53.513 --> 13:55.038
Keep going.

13:55.515 --> 13:57.176
Okay, guys, right there.
Stop, stop, stop.

14:06.259 --> 14:08.353
- Where is he?
- See the building in front of you?

14:08.528 --> 14:10.168
He's in the alley
on the other side of it.

14:10.296 --> 14:12.321
He hasn't moved since going online.

14:12.965 --> 14:15.285
- We can cut him off.
- Kensi, Deeks, we'll meet you there.

14:15.835 --> 14:17.269
Got it.

14:20.940 --> 14:22.430
Keep going.

14:32.685 --> 14:34.153
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.685
Eric, you sure you got this right?

14:35.855 --> 14:38.552
I told you, this schoolgirl uniform
thing's just become clich... Ow!

14:39.525 --> 14:41.391
- Whoa, stay here. Back.
- What are you doing?

14:41.561 --> 14:43.393
I have an AP English test
in ten minutes.

14:43.563 --> 14:45.053
You just assaulted a federal agent.

14:45.231 --> 14:47.427
Him? I thought he was a pervert.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.568
Yeah? Well, that too.

14:49.735 --> 14:50.896
Not a pervert.

14:51.070 --> 14:54.199
Well, at least not today.

14:54.807 --> 14:56.366
This is actually...

14:56.542 --> 14:57.566
It's worse than it looks.

14:59.178 --> 15:00.703
Field goal between the legs.

15:01.681 --> 15:04.207
She's, uh, surprisingly fast and agile.

15:04.784 --> 15:06.582
Impeccable, ugh...

15:07.186 --> 15:08.517
- aim.
- You locate him?

15:08.688 --> 15:10.747
Yeah. Yeah, we found him.

15:10.923 --> 15:12.721
And he beat up Deeks.

15:12.892 --> 15:14.257
It's not funny.

15:14.794 --> 15:18.196
I'm pretty sure
I'm missing something.

15:18.364 --> 15:19.559
I'm gonna go look for it.

15:21.934 --> 15:24.835
So this is the face of cyberterrorism.

15:39.383 --> 15:41.442
Let's start with your name.

15:44.288 --> 15:45.585
My name is Cindy Chang.

15:46.056 --> 15:48.388
I'm 15 years old.

15:48.959 --> 15:50.449
Capricorn.

15:50.627 --> 15:53.324
And now very late
for my AP English test.

15:53.497 --> 15:55.056
- You're gonna miss that test.
- Yeah.

15:55.232 --> 15:58.827
And the prom, college,
your adulthood,

15:59.002 --> 16:00.800
chance to find true love.

16:00.971 --> 16:03.599
- Oh, you can find true love in prison.
- Oh, that's a good point.

16:03.774 --> 16:06.072
All right, so there's
still some hope for true love,

16:06.243 --> 16:07.904
but everything else,
you can kiss goodbye.

16:08.078 --> 16:09.773
- Did you say prison?
- Yeah.

16:10.314 --> 16:12.282
It's standard punishment
for terrorism,

16:12.449 --> 16:14.747
murder, attempted murder,
obstruction of justice.

16:14.918 --> 16:16.750
Just for kicking blondie
in the gonads?

16:18.021 --> 16:22.288
- That was self-defense.
- Cindy, it's over.

16:22.693 --> 16:25.958
Your parents are on their way
with your lawyer.

16:26.897 --> 16:28.763
They know I'm here?

16:28.932 --> 16:31.560
- I'm dead.
- They're the least of your problems.

16:32.736 --> 16:34.431
Easy for you to say.

16:34.605 --> 16:36.073
You weren't raised by a tiger mom.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.106
In the meantime,
we're allowed to question you

16:38.275 --> 16:40.209
because we found
your cryptography key,

16:40.377 --> 16:43.540
which put national security information
into enemy hands.

16:48.452 --> 16:49.647
How did you find it?

16:49.820 --> 16:52.050
Because we're smarter than you.

16:53.156 --> 16:54.555
At least one of us is.

16:54.725 --> 16:56.887
Do not tell Eric I said that.

16:57.995 --> 16:59.963
What do you know
about the Molina Cartel?

17:01.532 --> 17:02.897
Is that a band?

17:05.202 --> 17:08.694
Your cryptography key was linked
to malware this drug cartel used

17:08.872 --> 17:11.000
to kill two federal agents
this morning.

17:17.047 --> 17:20.142
Okay, I admit, I've got some game.

17:22.819 --> 17:25.685
And I've hacked into
one or two networks for fun.

17:26.857 --> 17:30.122
But I swear, I have never done
anything to physically hurt anyone.

17:30.294 --> 17:34.424
Unfortunately, it still counts if you help
someone else kill a federal agent.

17:34.598 --> 17:36.566
But I didn't.

17:36.733 --> 17:39.862
The only people I've ever hacked
are the cliquey mean girls at school.

17:41.638 --> 17:44.664
And trust me,
Jessica Walker and her drones

17:44.841 --> 17:48.709
are so dumb and worried about
maintaining their gelicures,

17:48.879 --> 17:51.974
they probably don't even know
what cartels do.

17:52.482 --> 17:53.506
Why them?

17:58.255 --> 18:00.883
So I could see
what they were saying about me.

18:05.929 --> 18:07.624
They're the worst spellers ever.

18:08.665 --> 18:11.566
Did you hack their cell phones
or their computers?

18:11.735 --> 18:13.703
It doesn't matter.

18:13.870 --> 18:16.532
If they have Wi-Fi,
you only need one to get to the other.

18:22.312 --> 18:25.407
Names of all the girls you hacked.

18:29.286 --> 18:31.618
- How's it hanging?
- That's funny.

18:31.788 --> 18:34.428
No, seriously, Deeks, if you're injured,
you don't need to be here.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.491
Go back to your desk, walk it off.

18:39.229 --> 18:40.697
Nell, tell them what you found.

18:41.098 --> 18:44.090
Our hacker, Cindy Chang,
is a sophomore at Eastgate Prep,

18:44.267 --> 18:46.258
one of LAs
most sought-after private schools.

18:46.436 --> 18:47.904
Yeah, it's a feeder to the lvies.

18:48.071 --> 18:50.836
And a breeder for the city's
worst D-bags and princesses.

18:51.008 --> 18:53.128
Just because they didn't wanna
date you in high school

18:53.276 --> 18:54.869
does not make them princesses.

18:55.045 --> 18:58.015
No, the fact that they all had
personal trainers in high school

18:58.181 --> 18:59.706
is what makes them princesses.

18:59.883 --> 19:02.580
And every girl Cindy hacked
is also a student at Eastgate,

19:02.753 --> 19:05.347
just like she said,
but here's what's interesting.

19:05.856 --> 19:10.919
The girls' parents are basically
a who's who of CEOs, celebrities,

19:11.094 --> 19:12.357
foreign dignitaries.

19:12.529 --> 19:14.429
Do Lowell and Ambrose have kids
at Eastgate?

19:14.598 --> 19:18.000
Yup, you stole my headline.
Lowell's daughter is a junior,

19:18.168 --> 19:21.138
and Ambrose's niece, Emily,
is a sophomore.

19:21.838 --> 19:23.738
And Cindy hacked
both their phones?

19:24.241 --> 19:25.367
That's the link.

19:25.542 --> 19:28.034
Once the girls synched
their infected cell phones

19:28.211 --> 19:30.236
to Lowell and Ambrose's
home Wi-Fi,

19:30.414 --> 19:32.542
the secure agency phones
became compromised.

19:33.884 --> 19:35.875
There were seven other names
on Cindy's list.

19:36.053 --> 19:38.886
Yes, and each one's mom or dad
is more impressive than the next.

19:39.289 --> 19:40.654
Thanks, Nell.

19:40.824 --> 19:43.850
So is Cindy doing this unwittingly,
or is somebody else pulling the strings?

19:44.027 --> 19:47.292
I don't know, but this seems to go well
beyond infiltrating CIA and FBI.

19:47.831 --> 19:49.890
There's a lot of soft targets
at that school.

19:50.067 --> 19:52.627
These kids could be kidnapped,
used as leverage.

19:52.803 --> 19:54.100
They're gonna need protection.

19:54.504 --> 19:56.836
Somebody's going back
to high school.

19:59.209 --> 20:00.643
I nominate Kensi.

20:00.811 --> 20:02.677
- I don't wanna be nominated.
- I second.

20:02.846 --> 20:05.338
No, you don't, because you don't
understand how bad this is.

20:05.515 --> 20:08.416
Kensi as a substitute teacher.
Little eyeglasses, sweater set.

20:08.585 --> 20:11.213
No, that's a fantastic idea.
Possibilities are endless.

20:11.388 --> 20:15.586
- Any objections?
- Yes, I vehemently object.

20:15.759 --> 20:18.751
Vehemently? That is an excellent
SAT vocabulary word.

20:18.929 --> 20:20.419
You know what that means?
Kensi it is.

20:25.068 --> 20:26.126
No.

20:32.509 --> 20:33.908
Those heels are working for you.

20:34.077 --> 20:35.101
Stop it.

20:45.722 --> 20:48.157
- Kens, where are you going?
- Kensi?

20:50.293 --> 20:52.057
Kens, what's up?

20:52.229 --> 20:53.993
- Sorry, I can't do this.
- Why not?

20:54.164 --> 20:56.030
I told you. I tried telling you.

20:56.199 --> 20:57.826
It was bad. I am not kidding.

20:58.001 --> 21:01.733
We arranged a substitute teacher for
Cindy's class. They're expecting you.

21:01.905 --> 21:04.806
- They're expecting someone, not me.
- You're a professional.

21:04.975 --> 21:08.639
You went undercover in college before.
What's the difference?

21:08.812 --> 21:11.213
The difference is that college
doesn't have 15-year-olds.

21:11.381 --> 21:13.008
You can handle going back
to high school.

21:13.483 --> 21:16.180
- It was a dark place, guys.
- I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

21:16.353 --> 21:18.685
- Besides, you're an adult now.
- You didn't have boobs.

21:18.855 --> 21:21.483
You have no idea
how torturous high school can be.

21:22.459 --> 21:23.483
Deeks, get in there.

21:23.660 --> 21:26.322
No way. I was, like, the Ferris Bueller
of my high school.

21:26.496 --> 21:28.828
- Left on top, swore I'd never go back.
- Yeah.

21:28.999 --> 21:30.558
Probably not the best idea
to let Deeks

21:30.734 --> 21:32.759
be around so many
impressionable coeds.

21:33.537 --> 21:35.198
She's right.

21:36.573 --> 21:39.338
- And what's your excuse?
- I don't need one.

21:39.509 --> 21:41.204
It's your turn.

21:41.378 --> 21:44.404
I did the bar association
conference last week.

21:44.781 --> 21:49.378
- In fact, the next three are your turn.
- Really? Heh.

21:49.553 --> 21:52.488
So this is our most challenging
undercover assignment yet?

21:52.656 --> 21:54.181
Okay.

22:01.631 --> 22:03.827
I know, at you, seriously.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.298
- That's so funny. Ha-ha-ha.
- Great.

22:08.538 --> 22:11.064
Class. Ladies and gentlemen.

22:11.241 --> 22:13.869
Can I have your attention, please?

22:14.044 --> 22:15.068
Yo!

22:16.246 --> 22:19.682
As you may have heard, Mrs. Shoop
went home sick with the stomach flu.

22:19.850 --> 22:22.581
Mr. Bellridge
is your substitute teacher.

22:22.752 --> 22:24.151
He's new to this school,

22:24.321 --> 22:28.121
so I'm sure that you're going to give
him your warmest Eastgate welcome.

22:30.493 --> 22:34.555
Godspeed.
They're savage beasts at this age.

22:38.134 --> 22:40.660
- Really?
- 1am so tired.

22:40.837 --> 22:44.432
Hey, I bet this guy doesn't
even know what he's talking about.

22:44.608 --> 22:46.372
And I can probably pass out here...

22:54.517 --> 22:57.851
Hey, listen,
I'm pretty sure this guy's...

22:58.021 --> 22:59.853
Do you have something
you need to say?

23:00.423 --> 23:04.587
Yeah, um, Mr. Bellridge, I happened to
see a paper in the front office.

23:04.761 --> 23:07.560
But, um, is your first name
really Valerie?

23:10.734 --> 23:13.169
Yeah, it is.

23:14.204 --> 23:15.535
That is so cool.

23:19.309 --> 23:22.870
I understand you guys are studying
the Industrial Revolution, huh?

23:27.751 --> 23:29.583
Chapter seven?

23:31.655 --> 23:33.055
Let's take a look at chapter seven.

23:36.826 --> 23:38.555
Now...

23:40.230 --> 23:41.720
What?

23:45.302 --> 23:48.431
All right, that's a bit
of an oversimplification.

23:51.274 --> 23:52.673
We're not reading chapter seven.

23:53.777 --> 23:56.712
Let's open your books to chapter eight.
Start reading.

24:02.852 --> 24:05.480
- Yeah?
- Are you gonna sit down?

24:07.257 --> 24:09.225
I prefer to stand.

24:10.727 --> 24:12.058
You know, sitting can kill you.

24:13.263 --> 24:16.824
So why don't you all just
stay seated and start reading?

24:22.105 --> 24:23.504
Don't anybody move.

24:24.407 --> 24:27.866
- Oh, my God.
- Are you all right?

24:29.412 --> 24:30.971
What happened?

24:31.681 --> 24:34.207
- Teachers' lounge.
- Where did it come from?

24:34.384 --> 24:37.354
- Mr. Blackman.
- Everyone stay here.

24:38.922 --> 24:41.414
- What happened?
- Are you all right?

25:06.315 --> 25:09.012
Looks like one of
the school staff members,

25:09.184 --> 25:11.915
a Mr. Stanley Blackman, just hanged
himself less than an hour ago.

25:12.521 --> 25:13.579
I see.

25:14.623 --> 25:16.022
You don't sound very surprised.

25:16.758 --> 25:19.250
Mr. Blackman was the track coach
at the school.

25:19.428 --> 25:23.661
It seems he'd become a little
too friendly with his star hurdler.

25:24.666 --> 25:25.690
How do you know that?

25:25.867 --> 25:30.930
Because the star hurdler was one
of the girls Cindy Chang had hacked.

25:33.275 --> 25:34.470
The coach was blackmailed.

25:37.879 --> 25:40.712
Thought wearing a belt as a necklace
was an easier way out, huh?

25:40.882 --> 25:42.407
Hetty, I've confirmed the rest.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.451
All the girls Cindy hacked, their VIP
parents have been hacked too.

25:45.621 --> 25:48.056
This means privileged
dignitary correspondence,

25:48.223 --> 25:51.625
corporate strategies,
unpublished scientific research...

25:51.793 --> 25:55.024
Not to mention
CIA and FBI communications.

25:55.464 --> 25:58.058
The Molina Cartel
may be just a small part of this.

25:58.233 --> 26:01.362
Nell's right. I mean, whoever is
behind this has access to everything.

26:01.536 --> 26:03.436
The hacker's profiting
ten different ways.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.403
We have no idea
where this is gonna end.

26:05.574 --> 26:07.542
Oh, yes, we do, Mr. Callen.

26:07.709 --> 26:09.074
With us.

26:23.325 --> 26:25.157
No, see, I was... I was just...

26:25.327 --> 26:28.888
I stopped... I just...
I stopped to have a drink of water.

26:29.064 --> 26:31.345
- I got a text. I was answering the text.
- We don't care.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.730
I can't emphasize enough
how much we don't care.

26:33.902 --> 26:35.199
Did you just slow that down?

26:35.737 --> 26:37.762
- No.
- No?

26:37.939 --> 26:41.739
I will have you know, sir,
that walking is an Olympic sport.

26:41.910 --> 26:44.402
Speed-walking.
You forgot the "speed" part.

26:44.579 --> 26:46.206
- Still don't care.
- Hey, guys.

26:47.849 --> 26:49.442
What did you find?

26:49.618 --> 26:51.882
Um, we combed through the, um...

26:52.054 --> 26:53.385
- Deeks.
- Sorry.

26:55.991 --> 26:58.016
We combed through
the Facebook pages of Cindy Chang

26:58.193 --> 26:59.393
and the nine girls she hacked.

26:59.961 --> 27:01.725
They have a lot of friends.

27:01.897 --> 27:03.922
I'm not so sure
they're all actually friends.

27:04.099 --> 27:07.069
I found a bunch of birthday wishes
that felt pretty forced.

27:07.235 --> 27:08.532
What else did you find?

27:08.704 --> 27:12.834
We were able to confirm the identities
of all their, quote, "friends,"

27:13.008 --> 27:15.602
except for someone named
Matt Kirkley.

27:15.777 --> 27:17.370
He's a junior at Samohi.

27:17.546 --> 27:19.014
So tell us about Matt Kirkley.

27:19.181 --> 27:21.206
Matt Kirkley doesn't exist.

27:21.383 --> 27:22.612
The profile is a fake.

27:22.784 --> 27:25.412
So who is this guy connected to
at Eastgate Prep?

27:25.587 --> 27:26.918
Just one person.

27:27.089 --> 27:30.252
We'll give you three guesses.

27:34.363 --> 27:35.728
Matt?

27:35.897 --> 27:37.865
He's a soccer player at Samo.

27:38.033 --> 27:39.967
I've known him
a couple months. Why?

27:40.135 --> 27:42.331
And you two have hung out?

27:42.504 --> 27:45.565
Not on, like, a date, but, yeah.

27:47.142 --> 27:48.769
How did you two meet?

27:48.944 --> 27:50.708
Matt's a...

27:51.646 --> 27:53.444
colleague of mine.

27:56.718 --> 27:59.380
We met in a hacker chat room.

27:59.554 --> 28:01.283
Turned out we both live in L.A.

28:04.693 --> 28:06.684
What was that look for?

28:07.229 --> 28:08.253
Matt's not Matt.

28:08.997 --> 28:10.761
He doesn't go to Samo.

28:10.932 --> 28:12.593
And I doubt
he's a good soccer player.

28:13.368 --> 28:16.599
That's ridiculous. We've hung out.

28:16.772 --> 28:18.171
He knows the Samo fight song.

28:18.340 --> 28:20.180
And I'm sure you're
a great judge of character.

28:20.342 --> 28:23.505
You ever met any of his friends?
Anyone you know ever heard of him?

28:25.647 --> 28:28.139
Can you at least tell us
what he looks like?

28:29.117 --> 28:30.482
He's white.

28:30.652 --> 28:32.780
And he likes to wear baseball hats.

28:33.822 --> 28:35.620
What does this have to do
with why I'm here?

28:35.791 --> 28:36.917
Matt may be the reason

28:37.092 --> 28:38.890
why you're caught up
with the Molina Cartel,

28:39.060 --> 28:40.994
and nine other security violations.

28:41.163 --> 28:42.688
And one more death.

28:43.198 --> 28:44.529
A teacher at your school.

28:44.699 --> 28:46.690
Mr. Blackman.

28:47.969 --> 28:50.063
- What are you talking about?
- If you're lucky,

28:50.605 --> 28:53.302
we'll be able to prove
that Matt Kirkley, whoever he is,

28:53.475 --> 28:55.534
piggybacked on your hack
of the other students.

28:55.710 --> 28:58.839
And has been committing felonies
using your encryption key ever since.

29:00.449 --> 29:02.247
How?

29:02.617 --> 29:06.485
I know how vulnerable networks are,
and I'm super careful.

29:22.404 --> 29:25.396
Aah! What did I tell you
about sneaking up on people?

29:25.907 --> 29:28.188
I know, dying of fright is a real thing.
Blah, blah, blah.

29:30.111 --> 29:32.637
It is, okay? And it's called
stress cardiomyopathy.

29:32.814 --> 29:35.442
I'll forward you the link. Again.

29:35.851 --> 29:38.479
So, what are you doing down here?

29:38.653 --> 29:40.678
You, uh, sweating?

29:40.856 --> 29:44.087
Trying to figure out how Matt Kirkley
hacked Cindy's computer.

29:44.259 --> 29:46.819
She's too clever
to keep herself unguarded.

29:46.995 --> 29:49.054
And OneRepublic
gets your brain pumping?

29:49.998 --> 29:52.399
No judgment on your study habits.

29:52.567 --> 29:54.797
All right, so we know that
Cindy's hack led

29:54.970 --> 29:58.372
to everyone's phones and computers
through their home Wi-Fi routers.

29:58.540 --> 30:00.260
But not Agent Lowell
or Ambrose's computers,

30:00.408 --> 30:03.867
because they were signed on
to the secured network at the office.

30:04.045 --> 30:06.912
- Thank you, protocol.
- Picking up this pretty quickly.

30:07.082 --> 30:09.210
- My IQ crushes yours.
- Oh, I beg to differ.

30:11.319 --> 30:12.878
Okay.

30:13.255 --> 30:15.417
Now help me figure out
how Matt got to Cindy.

30:18.159 --> 30:21.094
- Maybe the exact same way.
- What way is that?

30:21.263 --> 30:22.788
Right under her nose.

30:33.108 --> 30:36.669
Do I need to find a little pair of khakis
for you, Mr. Beale?

30:36.845 --> 30:40.645
I am so sorry, Hetty. I'm dressed
this way for the sake of the case.

30:42.984 --> 30:46.648
You know, we have a very
lax dress code,

30:46.821 --> 30:50.689
and yet you still seem
to be violating it.

30:52.060 --> 30:56.156
I'm so close to cracking this,
if only my computer would hurry up.

30:56.331 --> 31:01.098
Not to speak of a few basic
codes of hygiene.

31:05.740 --> 31:07.333
That's it. I found it.

31:08.610 --> 31:10.078
No.

31:16.985 --> 31:18.316
What do you have, Eric?

31:18.486 --> 31:21.421
I know when Matt Kirkley
hacked into Cindy's computer.

31:21.590 --> 31:24.025
- Find out what she did last Saturday.
- Just a second.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.450
Where were you last Saturday?

31:26.628 --> 31:29.393
- I went Rollerblading at the beach.
- And then?

31:31.566 --> 31:32.829
Oh, I saw Matt.

31:34.869 --> 31:36.803
Next time you could lead with that.

31:37.606 --> 31:40.234
- What did you guys do?
- We went bowling.

31:40.909 --> 31:42.399
She went bowling with Matt.

31:45.480 --> 31:47.539
- Did he drive her?
- He drive you?

31:48.383 --> 31:50.852
No, my mom dropped me off.

31:51.219 --> 31:53.051
But Matt took me
to frozen yogurt after.

31:53.755 --> 31:55.120
I hate high school.

31:55.290 --> 31:57.258
Matt drove her to frozen yogurt
after bowling.

31:59.494 --> 32:01.326
In a new car with Wi-Fi, I bet.

32:01.496 --> 32:04.693
And he probably asked her to watch
a hilarious video on the way there.

32:04.866 --> 32:07.028
- Did he ask you to watch...?
- That rat.

32:07.202 --> 32:08.931
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

32:09.104 --> 32:13.166
He drives a 2014 black Scion.

32:13.341 --> 32:15.332
With Wi-Fi.

32:15.510 --> 32:18.639
Hacked my cell
when I was watching that video.

32:18.813 --> 32:20.110
And it wasn't even that funny.

32:20.281 --> 32:24.411
- Which bowling alley was that?
- The vintage one on Honolulu Street.

32:24.586 --> 32:26.350
Then we went
to the Yogurtland in Burbank.

32:27.522 --> 32:29.217
Did you get that, Eric?

32:30.025 --> 32:32.392
Searching traffic cam footage
from last Saturday.

32:32.827 --> 32:34.226
Who are you talking to, anyway?

32:35.430 --> 32:37.421
- Who figured it out?
- No one.

32:37.599 --> 32:39.693
Oh, is it that guy you said
is smarter than you?

32:40.702 --> 32:41.726
What was that?

32:42.303 --> 32:45.068
Sorry, uh, could you...?
Could you repeat that last part?

32:46.541 --> 32:47.565
Eric, what do you have?

32:48.243 --> 32:51.873
Well, I found Cindy.

32:52.313 --> 32:54.111
And our first picture of the hacker.

32:54.282 --> 32:56.444
Sending to you now.

32:58.953 --> 33:00.387
Okay, this is him.

33:01.189 --> 33:02.213
It's our guy.

33:04.159 --> 33:07.561
Great. Now all we have to do
is find a ghost.

33:20.374 --> 33:22.468
- Where are we?
- Using facial recognition,

33:22.643 --> 33:25.112
we believe the hacker's
Ethan Blume, 22 years old.

33:25.279 --> 33:27.805
He has a clean record, but
recently came into some serious bank.

33:27.981 --> 33:30.061
Selling information he accessed
from Cindy's network.

33:30.217 --> 33:32.117
Yeah, corporate strategies,
CIA intelligence...

33:32.286 --> 33:34.118
To any interested party
willing to pay.

33:34.288 --> 33:35.687
Competing software companies,

33:35.856 --> 33:39.383
high-school track coaches,
drug cartels.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.958
This guy must be making a killing.

33:41.128 --> 33:43.187
Except there is a teeny tiny problem.

33:43.363 --> 33:46.560
Ethan has no known address.
No cable bill, cell phone, credit cards.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.895
And the Scion he used
to hack Cindy was stolen.

33:49.069 --> 33:51.060
He contacted potential buyers
with burn phones

33:51.238 --> 33:53.730
that he purchased with cash
from locations throughout the city.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.267
He doesn't use a cryptography key.

33:55.409 --> 33:57.810
Eric can't find him by hacking back
through Cindy's computer.

33:57.978 --> 33:59.378
I mean, this guy could be anywhere.

33:59.513 --> 34:01.572
Except he's not. He's here.

34:02.449 --> 34:05.009
And we have something he likes.

34:07.454 --> 34:09.513
Energy drinks. You guys want some?
Those are free.

34:09.690 --> 34:11.886
Courtesy of America.
Have fun with that. See you later.

34:12.659 --> 34:15.094
- Are you guys sure this will work?
- Yes.

34:15.262 --> 34:17.889
Don't worry, we're not gonna
let anything happen to you.

34:18.065 --> 34:19.692
Oh, I'll be fine.

34:19.866 --> 34:22.164
But is it okay if I strangle Matt
when we find him?

34:23.337 --> 34:25.697
Strangling actually takes
a lot more stamina than you think.

34:25.839 --> 34:28.199
And you can't really improve
on your "kick to the nuts" act.

34:28.342 --> 34:30.400
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

34:30.577 --> 34:33.137
Yeah, no, it's all good.
Didn't really want kids anyway.

34:35.047 --> 34:36.607
Heads up, Kensi. He's on your six.

34:44.524 --> 34:46.117
I see him.

34:47.793 --> 34:50.456
Cindy, play it cool.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.766
Hey, Cindy. What's so urgent?

34:56.937 --> 34:59.065
You lowlife. Little piece of...

35:02.442 --> 35:03.876
- We got a runner.
- No.

35:05.912 --> 35:06.970
Watch it, jerk!

35:10.684 --> 35:12.379
Oh, crap.

35:15.856 --> 35:17.620
Nope. Nope.

35:24.865 --> 35:26.856
How did you know
he was gonna jump?

35:27.034 --> 35:30.595
- Staircase to nowhere.
- Door's obviously locked.

35:30.771 --> 35:32.398
I didn't feel like taking the stairs.

35:33.707 --> 35:36.938
- You guys are cops?
- Yeah. No more questions.

35:46.753 --> 35:49.188
Thank you so much for coming.

35:50.257 --> 35:54.694
Mom, Dad,
this is Agent Sam Hanna.

35:54.861 --> 35:58.661
Mr. And Mrs. Chang,
you have quite a daughter.

36:01.134 --> 36:03.831
Just give me one second
to talk to him.

36:08.241 --> 36:09.766
I just needed to tell you,

36:12.212 --> 36:15.512
I'm so sorry for everything
that happened.

36:17.050 --> 36:19.417
All the people that got hurt.

36:21.288 --> 36:22.312
I really messed up.

36:24.191 --> 36:26.683
You're right. You did.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.052
I know.

36:30.630 --> 36:32.962
But you also helped us in a big way.

36:35.769 --> 36:38.067
I don't think we could have
caught Ethan without you.

36:39.506 --> 36:41.873
I would do anything
to make things right.

36:43.710 --> 36:45.804
Sam, people died because of me.

36:47.481 --> 36:49.745
What you're feeling right now,

36:50.350 --> 36:52.512
it's called responsibility.

36:55.789 --> 36:57.780
Well, it blows.

36:57.958 --> 36:59.357
That may be true,

37:00.127 --> 37:02.152
but hold on to it.

37:03.396 --> 37:06.195
Most people your age can't handle it.

37:07.234 --> 37:08.429
But you can.

37:09.803 --> 37:11.032
Okay.

37:16.143 --> 37:18.111
Take care, Cindy.

37:20.180 --> 37:21.739
I will.

37:23.650 --> 37:25.118
Eric.

37:26.019 --> 37:28.283
Nice job with this.

37:28.688 --> 37:29.780
Oh, no sweat.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.788
"No sweat."

37:37.764 --> 37:39.732
Hello, I'm Eric Beale.

37:39.900 --> 37:44.861
I'm here on official NCIS duty
to return this to you, ma'am.

37:45.505 --> 37:48.065
- Thanks.
- Yeah, I'm not an agent.

37:48.241 --> 37:51.302
I work in more
of a technical capacity.

37:51.478 --> 37:53.640
No one here really
understands what I do.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.406
Oh, you're the smart one.

37:56.850 --> 37:58.614
The smart... Sorry, what's that?

37:59.886 --> 38:03.914
- Well, um, thanks for this.
- Yeah.

38:05.458 --> 38:06.789
Am I allowed to go home now?

38:08.628 --> 38:10.062
Yeah.

38:16.403 --> 38:17.427
Hey, Cindy.

38:20.106 --> 38:22.131
You got skills. I can tell.

38:24.177 --> 38:27.147
But you have to figure out a way
to use them for good,

38:27.314 --> 38:30.807
or it's just a waste
of natural resources.

38:36.189 --> 38:37.679
Can I...?

38:41.661 --> 38:43.493
Am I allowed to see you again?

38:44.598 --> 38:47.124
Yeah, sure.

38:47.634 --> 38:49.568
Five or six years.

38:52.772 --> 38:56.174
Okay, then it's a date.

39:13.660 --> 39:15.890
- Good night, Hetty.
- Oh, Mr. Callen,

39:16.062 --> 39:20.056
SECNAV called to say,
"Job well done.”

39:20.233 --> 39:21.793
We were able to destroy
all the malware?

39:21.968 --> 39:22.992
All of it.

39:23.169 --> 39:25.399
And the Molina Cartel's
opium exchange with al Qaeda?

39:25.572 --> 39:28.701
We have a new task force,
already assembled.

39:28.875 --> 39:29.899
They'll find them.

39:30.477 --> 39:32.002
I have no doubt.

39:32.545 --> 39:34.240
See you tomorrow.

39:36.182 --> 39:37.741
What?

39:37.917 --> 39:40.511
No, no, no. Okay.

39:41.488 --> 39:44.924
Okay. Callen, what did you do
with my treadmill?

39:45.659 --> 39:47.593
I am offended
that you would ask me first.

39:48.962 --> 39:50.987
Kensi, this isn't funny.

39:51.164 --> 39:52.393
I completely disagree.

39:53.900 --> 39:56.369
- Sam?
- I still don't care.

40:00.640 --> 40:03.109
You can blame me, Mr. Deeks.

40:03.576 --> 40:06.637
You? Hetty, but why...?

40:06.813 --> 40:10.272
The treadmill was drawing
just enough power

40:10.450 --> 40:12.350
to cause a delay in our network.

40:12.519 --> 40:14.886
Delay in the network?
And you expect me to believe that?

40:15.055 --> 40:19.253
This is a very old building,
if you haven't noticed.

40:19.426 --> 40:22.691
What about my heightened risk of
heart disease? Huh? What about that?

40:22.862 --> 40:25.888
All right, listen, we in the walking
workstation community,

40:26.066 --> 40:27.864
we will not be silenced, all right?

40:28.034 --> 40:29.968
Our motors will run loud,

40:30.136 --> 40:32.002
and they will run proud, okay?

40:32.172 --> 40:34.197
So hear us tread!

40:34.374 --> 40:36.274
I'm gonna stage a walk-in!

40:36.743 --> 40:40.111
What a drama queen.
