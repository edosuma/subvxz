WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:03.628
Previously, on "Below
Deck Mediterranean"...

00:05.714 --> 00:06.840
Cheers to that.

00:06.881 --> 00:08.341
We're gonna dance.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.844
Ray was literally doing
cartwheels on the floor.

00:10.885 --> 00:12.595
Raygan, Raygan, Storm?

00:14.556 --> 00:15.682
I think just you and
I are gonna do, eh?

00:15.724 --> 00:16.683
Yeah.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.101
[vomits]

00:20.687 --> 00:24.065
I don't care who I share with.

00:29.738 --> 00:33.491
On our last boat, me and
Tash, we got together.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.368
We just had
so much fun together.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.539
I'm Natalya, nice to meet you.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.291
I'm so excited.

00:41.332 --> 00:43.418
Is this, like, my sister,
or is this my twin?

00:43.460 --> 00:45.503
We're like twins, almost, yeah.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.631
We think you're a couple.

00:48.673 --> 00:49.799
You're in a cabin together
and you work together,

00:49.841 --> 00:51.301
and we think you are.

00:51.343 --> 00:53.428
Tash asked me to keep it secret,

00:53.470 --> 00:57.223
because she was still
with her boyfriend.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.269
I'm struggling with
keeping it a secret.

01:05.940 --> 01:08.610
I don't want people to know.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.406
Cheating is not
something that I'm proud of.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.582
I wish for a boyfriend!

01:22.624 --> 01:25.627
I've never had a relationship
longer than a couple months.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.796
I get lost in her
----ing Goddamn eyes.

01:27.837 --> 01:28.880
I've got a thing
for Australians, man.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.256
Storm is super fit.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.508
I'm into it.

01:31.549 --> 01:33.927
Do you wanna go down...
no, I'm kidding.

01:33.968 --> 01:34.928
Let's go.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.596
Charter number two...

01:36.638 --> 01:37.764
Emily Butler works for
her family's business,

01:37.806 --> 01:39.182
Butler and Associates.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.475
Cheers to the beginning
of the end.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.477
-Yay!
-Yeah.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.562
I'm a service queen
from the get-go.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.147
I'm gonna go find
a husband somewhere.

01:47.691 --> 01:50.610
I'm gay as hell, babe.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.279
Where's your schedule?
I need that.

01:53.321 --> 01:54.322
Is that 1:00 a.m.
to 2:00 a.m.?

01:54.364 --> 01:55.323
One to 2:00 in the afternoon.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.283
Oh, that's tomorrow.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.285
Raygan's schedule kinda
just looks like a math problem

01:59.327 --> 02:02.622
that just doesn't
have a solution.

02:02.664 --> 02:05.250
Raygan, where's the inflatables?
Start blowing them up.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.918
I am doing everything I can.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.255
She just has to take
the ball and succeed.

02:10.296 --> 02:11.673
I'm figuring out
everyone's weaknesses

02:11.715 --> 02:13.258
and where I need to be more.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.467
You need to figure out
your own weaknesses,

02:14.509 --> 02:15.802
that's where you're struggling.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.637
Yes, on other boats
you had these positions.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.514
-Yeah.
-But it wasn't this busy.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.974
So...

02:21.016 --> 02:22.600
Everyone works differently,
so if you want...

02:22.642 --> 02:24.227
No, no, no. Super yachts
don't work like that.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.312
Show me you can do this job.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.676
Coffee.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.225
I need to be able to have
a bosun I can trust

03:04.267 --> 03:07.771
and a bosun that
has guest priority.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.272
You know what I mean?

03:11.649 --> 03:12.609
And I'll prove myself to you.

03:12.650 --> 03:13.777
Okay, awesome, thank you.

03:13.818 --> 03:14.778
-Thank you.
-I appreciate it.

03:14.819 --> 03:15.987
Thank you for the...

03:16.029 --> 03:17.697
like, the way you helped me out
as well.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.366
Yeah, sometimes it
could be harsh,

03:19.407 --> 03:20.867
but it's because
I don't wanna be learning

03:20.909 --> 03:22.577
-in front of the guests.
-Yeah, yeah.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.371
You know what I mean?
We should already be there.

03:24.412 --> 03:25.789
-All right, good.
-Yeah, thank you.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.457
Awesome, thank you.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.259
It's really hot today.

03:48.436 --> 03:49.813
I'm ready to live my best life.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.357
Maybe I'll go to Monaco
and find an 80-year-old

03:52.399 --> 03:54.275
who's about to cark it.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.069
Do it, man.

03:56.111 --> 03:59.823
Get him wasted, get him to sign
over the paperwork to the yacht,

03:59.864 --> 04:01.908
accidentally have a tragic death
where he falls off a cliff.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.451
Sounds like a dream, that.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.620
On that note, I have
to go set the table.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.957
Goodbye.

04:08.998 --> 04:09.958
How you doing?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.001
We're finished here.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.340
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.050
What I think would be
most important is, like,

04:19.092 --> 04:21.344
if we just throw everything
in the water.

04:21.386 --> 04:22.637
-Yeah.
-Like, jet-skis, tenders, toys.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.888
Yeah.

04:25.598 --> 04:26.933
-Sure.
-Before we get changed.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.435
Happy to have a meeting.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.519
Like, on the aft, yeah.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.438
Good morning.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.485
The weather is
gonna be terrible.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.327
Morning, how are you?

04:52.167 --> 04:54.794
Deck, deck, can you come
the platform, please?

04:54.836 --> 04:56.087
<i>Copy, on my way.</i>

05:01.634 --> 05:03.428
I'm not being grumpy.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.890
Do you wanna know how my
day started this morning?

05:06.931 --> 05:09.768
I woke up, I come out my cabin,
and I kicked coffee everywhere.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.689
What?

05:17.192 --> 05:18.526
Why are you being weird?

05:18.568 --> 05:20.487
-How am I being weird?
-You are.

05:20.528 --> 05:23.698
Even though things seem
like they're in a good space

05:23.740 --> 05:26.826
right now, deep down
I'm really struggling

05:26.868 --> 05:29.037
with this
whole situation with Dave.

05:31.081 --> 05:34.542
I broke up with my ex right
before stepping onto the boat,

05:34.584 --> 05:37.837
but ever since I
cheated on him with Dave,

05:37.879 --> 05:39.714
I couldn't forgive myself.

05:39.756 --> 05:42.676
I just felt constant guilt.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.761
Like, I'm so regretful.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.722
I guess I'm just trying
to avoid Dave

05:47.764 --> 05:49.974
from telling the rest
of the crew,

05:50.016 --> 05:52.560
because a lot of
people have

05:52.602 --> 05:56.690
different perceptions
of cheating.

05:56.731 --> 06:00.026
Some people think you're, like,
the worst person in the world,

06:00.068 --> 06:03.697
and I don't know how the crew

06:03.738 --> 06:07.158
are gonna react towards the
situation of what's happened.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.079
Okay, guys.

06:26.594 --> 06:30.056
And you know how
to do the tender?

06:30.098 --> 06:31.850
Yeah, so, I'm
good on the tender.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.810
-Yeah?
-I can drive it.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.812
-All right.
-Okay.

06:40.942 --> 06:45.113
And it's just, like, I do feel
like my job is on the line.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.239
Cheers.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.741
This looks amazing.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.868
Cheers to the
breakfast table.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.745
I actually haven't
enjoyed these guests.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.747
God, I hate hangovers.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.457
Why does it have to be a
consequence for drinking?

06:55.498 --> 06:57.042
That's such bullsh--.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.918
Noah is from an
extremely wealthy family.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.754
He owns his own private jet
and helicopter.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.964
Noah states, "Why drive
when a helicopter

07:03.006 --> 07:04.674
can get you there faster?"

07:04.716 --> 07:07.552
They probably had 15 drinks,
at least, yesterday...

07:07.594 --> 07:08.970
at least.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.096
Oh, yeah, I mean, think of
all the wine at dinner.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.806
Tommy!

07:11.848 --> 07:12.974
Oh!

07:13.016 --> 07:14.684
This is where you
make the magic.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.144
Ah!

07:16.186 --> 07:17.270
I've seen you way worse.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.689
[laughing]

07:22.233 --> 07:25.653
The special...
scrambled eggs with bacon.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.489
Perfect.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.744
They go above and
beyond on their food.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.162
Mm-hmm.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.291
Let's go swim,
that'll wake us up.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.627
Swimming does help hangovers,
washes it away.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.087
How many guests are up?

07:42.128 --> 07:43.838
All of them,
they're all sat at the tables.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.799
Are they hanging balls, babe?

07:45.840 --> 07:49.719
We're giving them heaps of
juice, coffees and everything.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.639
Oh, well, you gotta do what
you gotta do sometimes in life.

07:52.681 --> 07:53.807
Period.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.558
The lunch,
should we aim for 3:00?

07:55.600 --> 07:56.601
-Perfect.
-Okay.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.144
-Yeah?
-Sure.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.729
And also, we can go over to,
like, caves for a little,

07:59.771 --> 08:01.773
like, morning swim or a
dip as well.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.982
Okay.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.943
All crew, all crew, that
is going to be

08:04.984 --> 08:08.154
an 11:30 cave swim
with all guests.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.823
Copy that.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.116
All right, so we're gonna
do waters, beers.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.992
I'm just gonna get some ice,

08:13.034 --> 08:14.661
because I'm gonna start packing
the tender for the guests.

08:14.703 --> 08:15.870
Okay.

08:15.912 --> 08:16.871
Your face is gorgeous
today, babe.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.707
Oh my...

08:18.748 --> 08:20.083
It's because I haven't put
my contacts in, but...

08:20.125 --> 08:22.168
-Are... ha!
-[laughing]

08:24.129 --> 08:25.839
Is this glass
fine for rose?

08:25.880 --> 08:27.173
My lovely wife needs to
give me confirmation

08:27.215 --> 08:28.174
if that's the right one.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.926
-Oh, you.
-Yes.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.136
Yeah, it'll do.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.679
No, no, of course.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.014
Why don't you come
on the boat today?

08:34.055 --> 08:35.181
I'm gonna clean
all the cabins now.

08:35.223 --> 08:36.349
You just wanted to get me alone.

08:36.391 --> 08:38.018
Yeah, pretty much.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.060
Jay?

08:39.102 --> 08:41.021
What are we doing, bro?

08:41.062 --> 08:43.064
So, we're ready to go pretty
much to the cave and go dive.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.860
-No, Mzi's coming with me.
-Okay.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.945
What I'm used to
is smaller motor boats

08:48.987 --> 08:51.698
and smaller sailboats.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.366
And as a skipper,
I'm totally comfortable

08:53.408 --> 08:55.035
in taking guests out,

08:55.076 --> 08:57.912
going on little day
adventures in a small tender.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.706
It's literally
what I love to do.

08:59.748 --> 09:02.959
But instead, I'm just inflating
and deflating things.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.837
I think I definitely
could be used a little more

09:05.879 --> 09:07.630
in the tender role especially,

09:07.672 --> 09:11.176
but I'm just gonna keep working
hard until it's my time.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.179
So, then after they leave,
I'll start packing stuff up?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.597
-Yeah.
-Okay.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.141
The lunch menu...

09:19.642 --> 09:21.311
this is the old one, right?

09:21.353 --> 09:25.023
And then so we can do
Mexican theme after all.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.150
-Yeah.
-Okay.

09:29.027 --> 09:32.238
I'm just really struggling with
the whole Natasha situation,

09:32.280 --> 09:35.909
because the night before
we joined Motor Yacht Home,

09:35.950 --> 09:37.786
Tash and I made an agreement.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.830
When we get to a week,
we can slowly,

09:40.872 --> 09:42.832
like, adapt this, and
then let everyone know.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.709
This was our whole plan.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.795
Otherwise I wouldn't have
even shared a cabin with her.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.964
I don't care who I share with.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.386
We're roomies?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.888
And now I feel like
she's avoiding me.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.266
I just can't handle
this pressure anymore.

10:03.687 --> 10:04.854
Coming up...

10:04.896 --> 10:06.106
Three meters, holding.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.774
Three meters, dude?

10:07.816 --> 10:09.442
One meter...
she's gonna hit it, man.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.194
We're gonna hit, we're gonna hit

10:11.236 --> 10:12.237
[crashing]

10:21.746 --> 10:22.163
Ready, Freddie?

10:23.289 --> 10:24.374
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.167
Let's go to the VIP cabin first.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.752
No master?

10:27.794 --> 10:29.170
No, just to pull up
the bed, at least.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.922
I got you.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.215
I think it's this one that
had the Mexican stuff.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.383
Yeah.

10:34.509 --> 10:35.885
Oh my God!

10:38.304 --> 10:40.056
What can I get you guys?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.355
-Is that a taco?
-It's a taco.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.898
Oh, my God, that is so dirty.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.150
It's a taco hat, isn't it?

10:53.903 --> 10:55.822
All right, this is your cave

10:55.864 --> 10:57.323
that you guys can jump in and
go and explore, if you'd like.

10:57.365 --> 11:00.035
-Woo!
-Cannonball!

11:00.076 --> 11:01.369
All right, everyone's in.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.871
That's the way to go.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.039
Can you believe
we're here right now?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.040
No.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.332
I feel so spoiled.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.542
Yeah, this is beautiful.

11:07.584 --> 11:08.543
Yeah.

11:08.585 --> 11:09.878
That's beautiful, eh?

11:09.919 --> 11:12.339
Yeah.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.965
Um... I guess I'll just
tie these down...

11:14.007 --> 11:15.550
-Yeah.
-Secure all the stuff.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.093
Yeah, that'd be great.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.470
It's all around, but that.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.013
I don't trust it.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.895
Raygan, Raygan, Storm.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.105
-Tender incoming.
-Copy that.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.445
-Let's do a monkey brain.
-Yeah.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.824
It's coming early,
swells building.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.454
It's all right, it's a rope.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.081
Okay, you're gonna put
your foot on there,

11:46.122 --> 11:47.916
and then you're gonna
give me your hand.

11:47.957 --> 11:48.958
There you go, well done.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.168
Ah!

11:50.210 --> 11:53.004
Oh, that's so nice!

11:53.046 --> 11:55.256
You're just so on top of it.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.800
Hey, will you guys
sit down for a photo?

11:56.841 --> 11:59.052
This is perfect,
you're all together!

11:59.094 --> 12:00.261
Come on in!

12:00.303 --> 12:01.262
Sandy, do you wanna
get in with us?

12:01.304 --> 12:02.430
Yeah!

12:02.472 --> 12:03.556
I would totally
love that, but...

12:03.598 --> 12:04.557
-Let's do it.
-See that?

12:04.599 --> 12:06.142
The weather?

12:06.184 --> 12:08.061
Yeah, we're gonna go
back to the dock.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.312
It's gonna be, like,
30 knots of wind.

12:09.354 --> 12:10.897
Whoa.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.107
And there are gonna be,
like, four-meter seas,

12:12.148 --> 12:13.441
which is, like, massive.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.442
Tonight, we're going
to the dock?

12:14.484 --> 12:15.443
Yeah.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.444
Oh!

12:16.486 --> 12:18.279
I feel really bad.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.448
I never wanna go back to
the dock when I'm on charter.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.909
I'm here to show
these guests a good time.

12:22.951 --> 12:27.122
It's all about safety for me,
and it's my responsibility.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.916
So, I have to get
back to the dock.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.292
I wasn't expecting that.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.086
Honestly, I'm just shocked.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.130
Nothing a tequila
shot can't fix.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.464
We're going back to the dock.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.550
Can I do one of those
Corona sunrises?

12:38.591 --> 12:41.177
Yeah, how many?

12:41.219 --> 12:43.638
Just... well...

12:43.680 --> 12:45.974
All crew, all crew,
we are going back to the dock,

12:46.016 --> 12:48.059
we are going back to the dock.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.563
Oh, my God,
Heaven help me.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.273
-Mzi?
-Yeah?

12:53.314 --> 12:56.526
We need to deflate all of
this sh--, dude.

12:56.568 --> 12:57.652
We gotta hustle, people.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.070
The wind's, like, picking up.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.325
Floating taupe.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.036
Natalya, Natalya, Tasha.

13:08.955 --> 13:09.956
Go ahead.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.207
Do you wanna get drinks order?

13:11.249 --> 13:12.542
Copy, I'll go down there now.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.377
Thanks, hon.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.172
I know, that's so sh--ty.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.340
Yeah.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.008
All right, we are good to go.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.217
Yeah.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.433
Okay, sure.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.560
I'll take one of those.

13:30.602 --> 13:31.644
-Okay, sure, easy
-Thank you.

13:31.686 --> 13:32.979
I'll bring a whole tray.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.317
<i>Raygan, Raygan, to the bridge.</i>

13:37.359 --> 13:38.610
Raygan, to the bridge.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.199
What do you need?

13:44.240 --> 13:47.118
First I'm gonna make this
Corona drink, she's just here.

13:47.160 --> 13:51.206
And then I've gotta make a
whole tray of six spicy...

13:51.247 --> 13:52.707
Probably eight margaritas.

13:52.749 --> 13:53.958
-Do you want me to do them?
-Can you, actually?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.293
Yeah.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.544
Kyle, you need to smile
more in your photos.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.046
Can you jump into the laundry?

13:58.088 --> 13:59.464
Yeah, on my way.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.384
So, before this you worked
on other boats, yes?

14:02.425 --> 14:05.929
Yeah, I'm actually a
captain on smaller boats.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.222
Oh, really?

14:07.263 --> 14:08.682
On sailboats that's,
like, 60-foot.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.184
Before that, I was in
corporate America.

14:11.226 --> 14:15.105
America's a sh--show, so I
don't think I wanna go back.

14:16.690 --> 14:17.941
-Hey.
-Hi.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.110
So, we're gonna go side two.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.407
I want you to be the stern

14:25.448 --> 14:27.450
and let me know when
I'm clear to swing

14:27.492 --> 14:29.619
from the dolphin so
I can turn the boat.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.162
-Yeah, no problem.
-Okay.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.414
You know, going
into this docking,

14:32.455 --> 14:33.707
there's so many variables.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.625
A lot of wind,
there's a current,

14:35.667 --> 14:37.585
there's too many dolphins
all over the place,

14:37.627 --> 14:39.254
so I have to zigzag in.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.047
It makes it more difficult.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.008
<i>Deck, deck, can I have you</i>
<i>on the bow, please?</i>

14:43.049 --> 14:44.134
Copy that.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.306
Yeah.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.646
Uh-uh, my asshole burns.

14:56.688 --> 14:59.190
My asshole's, like...

14:59.232 --> 15:01.317
[laughing]

15:07.240 --> 15:09.284
I love Tash.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.287
I get on with females
like a house on fire.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.622
So, we go one-on-one...

15:14.664 --> 15:16.624
or is it oil on
a house on fire?

15:20.670 --> 15:23.465
Tasha's gonna drive me insane
for all the right reasons,

15:23.506 --> 15:25.592
and keep me smiling
and bubbling inside.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.179
Need to know how...

15:29.220 --> 15:31.264
Jeez, how many shots
have you had so far?

15:31.306 --> 15:33.600
Can I start making
a few cocktails?

15:33.641 --> 15:35.310
[bleep] me!

15:35.352 --> 15:37.687
Our plan for docking is
I'm gonna be on the stern,

15:37.729 --> 15:39.147
so I'll have you on the bow,

15:39.189 --> 15:40.148
because you know
what you're doing.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.399
Yeah.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.609
And obviously,
I need someone up here.

15:42.650 --> 15:43.610
Then maybe you can
be in the mid.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.611
-Cool.
-Yeah?

15:44.652 --> 15:46.488
Who ordered margaritas?

15:46.529 --> 15:47.489
I don't know, but I'll take
one if there's an extra.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.199
Yeah, sure.

15:49.240 --> 15:52.327
<i>Deck crew, deck crew,</i>
<i>we are ready to depart.</i>

15:53.370 --> 15:55.705
[laughing]

15:55.747 --> 15:57.248
Whoops!

15:59.876 --> 16:01.044
Great, thank you.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.420
Start hauling the anchor.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.386
Anchor is at home,
anchor is at home.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.264
<i>We're headed back to the dock.</i>

16:13.306 --> 16:16.559
Can you get, Jason, three lines
ready on the stern, please?

16:16.601 --> 16:17.852
Yep.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.230
And I'm just gonna
eat something.

16:20.271 --> 16:21.523
-I haven't eaten all day.
-Yeah, no go ahead.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.525
Oh, that looks sexy,
is that for lunch?

16:23.566 --> 16:26.194
-Yeah.
-Hot.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.488
Mzi, we need to start
flaking our lines out, please,

16:28.530 --> 16:29.698
as quick as possible.

16:29.739 --> 16:30.824
Where's Raygan?

16:33.118 --> 16:34.744
Raygan, Raygan, Storm.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.708
What the [bleep] are you doing?

16:39.749 --> 16:41.376
I mean, this is ----ing
bullsh--, dude.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.131
[bleep]'s sake, mate.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.132
Coming up...

16:50.135 --> 16:53.722
I'd like to think that Dave
respects my wishes

16:53.763 --> 16:56.558
in terms of not telling
the crew about us.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.478
But I kind
of do feel like

17:11.698 --> 17:12.699
Are we really going
back to the dock?

17:13.908 --> 17:15.910
The storm's coming in, they say.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.793
Let's just sort this
----ing mess out.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.515
Let's move these
NautiBuoys, please.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.477
So, naturally, if nobody's
sort of taking that position,

17:40.518 --> 17:41.895
he will always step up.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.315
-Raygan, you all right?
-Yeah.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.692
What's up?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.194
Okay.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.490
-Nat?
-Yes?

17:53.531 --> 17:55.533
What is it?

17:58.536 --> 17:59.537
Port... oh!

18:05.877 --> 18:07.879
Are you okay?

18:07.921 --> 18:09.422
I actually hate my life.

18:09.464 --> 18:12.258
Like, this is the lowest
point in my life.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.011
Kyle, I have to clean
this area, I cannot work.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.721
Can I help you?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.390
No, I've got it.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.603
I'm gonna go pee, and then
I'm gonna start on round two.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.403
Hey, when's lunch?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.571
Well, we're gonna be docked
in approximately 30 minutes.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.281
So, we should probably
wait till we dock?

18:35.323 --> 18:36.783
That's ultimately your call.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.868
Emily, just wait till
you get to the dock.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.870
-Okay, I'm gonna wait.
-Fab.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.790
I'm sending Noah home
to his mother.

18:43.832 --> 18:44.791
I'm sending him home.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.376
-Chef?
-Yeah?

18:46.418 --> 18:48.503
Lunch at 4:00 p.m. on the dot.

18:49.838 --> 18:52.257
[sighs]

18:52.298 --> 18:53.550
The struggle is real today.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.635
If you delay lunch,
it's the worst,

18:55.677 --> 18:58.638
because then you've got the
potential of food drying out.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.974
Then if they want dinner later,

19:01.016 --> 19:03.309
it just carries on
through the same nightmare.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.937
But, I mean, it's my job,
I've gotta be flexible.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.439
Ugh.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.946
Is there any more cocktails?

19:14.988 --> 19:16.573
Can you surprise me with
your favorite drink?

19:16.614 --> 19:18.908
Okay, you can let go.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.285
A lot of wind, man.

19:22.037 --> 19:23.788
Nice jacket.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.623
Thank you, it
matches the deckhand.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.791
That's why I put it on.

19:31.463 --> 19:34.924
Why is my boobies
itchy right now?

19:40.805 --> 19:42.474
Oh, thank you.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.315
When the laundry's out of
control, I feel out of control.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.987
Rum or...

19:56.029 --> 19:57.739
[chattering]

20:00.617 --> 20:02.035
What's in between
lunch and dinner?

20:02.077 --> 20:03.453
So, what time would
you like dinner?

20:03.495 --> 20:04.704
What are we gonna do?

20:04.746 --> 20:05.789
No, but, like,
what are we gonna do?

20:07.832 --> 20:09.376
Are we just hanging out?

20:09.417 --> 20:11.753
Maybe get a male stripper.

20:11.795 --> 20:15.465
-I say no.
-No!

20:18.510 --> 20:20.345
I don't understand it.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.890
Does that mean "let's jump off
the side of the boat?"

20:26.851 --> 20:28.687
Do you guys wanna go sit inside?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.605
Sure, it's a little bit windy.

20:30.647 --> 20:33.566
So, when you come in on
stern two,

20:33.608 --> 20:35.402
what are the lines that you
lock off when she says,

20:35.443 --> 20:36.528
"Stop the boat?"

20:38.154 --> 20:39.489
Cool, and then once
that's done...

20:39.531 --> 20:41.074
Then we move on to
the next line.

20:41.116 --> 20:42.826
Kyle!

20:42.867 --> 20:44.494
We don't have... Why do...
Kyle keeps running away.

20:44.536 --> 20:45.537
Thirty minutes.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.163
I need to get your hot sauce.

20:47.205 --> 20:48.873
If you guys don't order drinks,
then I'll sit here.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.710
But when you order drinks,
I'm gonna run around.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.753
Well, like, could you do this,
this, this, this,

20:53.795 --> 20:55.505
and also do nothing and
come hang out with us?

20:55.547 --> 20:58.883
Deck crew, deck crew
are you guys ready?

21:00.552 --> 21:03.763
Thank you.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.682
We're gonna take it
on the port lane,

21:05.724 --> 21:06.850
because I can't see anything.

21:06.891 --> 21:07.892
Copy.

21:13.815 --> 21:16.568
So beautiful, driving
into a place like this.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.532
I'm very comfortable
when it comes to docking.

21:22.574 --> 21:25.660
Like, all my life,
I've done so many dockings,

21:25.702 --> 21:27.620
because obviously,
me being a captain

21:27.662 --> 21:30.415
and being able to dock
a boat myself anyway.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.208
So yeah, I've got a
chance to actually

21:32.250 --> 21:34.878
prove to Sandy that
I know what I'm doing.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.838
Just see if you can help.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.049
Holy sh--.

21:39.090 --> 21:40.884
How do you even know
which one to pull?

21:40.925 --> 21:43.094
There's that, there's that one,
there's the buoys.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.889
We throw that out first,
which is tied to the big line.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.974
God, you guys are studs.

21:48.016 --> 21:49.559
Where'd you guys come in from?

21:49.601 --> 21:50.727
Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

21:50.769 --> 21:52.020
-Where are you from?
-Indiana.

21:52.062 --> 21:53.772
You know Idaho, then.

21:56.691 --> 21:58.109
I'm keeping clear, yes.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.819
And you're not allowed
to speak to each other,

21:59.861 --> 22:01.154
because he's gotta
concentrate on me.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.114
I won't distract.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.699
Would you like us to
start bringing food up?

22:04.741 --> 22:05.992
Yes.

22:06.034 --> 22:09.579
All right, we'll see
you out there.

22:09.621 --> 22:12.165
I'm gonna go through
seven and eight.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.042
Jesus Christ,
that's ----ing tight.

22:14.084 --> 22:15.043
And we've got a wind on us.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.127
Yeah.

22:20.048 --> 22:22.926
Let me know when it's
clear to drive through.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.636
We are all clear, all clear.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.891
Dolphin, three meters
on starboard.

22:29.933 --> 22:33.269
Starboard!

22:33.311 --> 22:34.854
That is so impressive.

22:34.896 --> 22:38.108
Like, this size of boat,
Sandy's got us.

22:38.149 --> 22:41.486
Twenty meters to
the dock, starboard side.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.697
Five meters on starboard side?

22:43.738 --> 22:46.491
I'm clear?

22:46.533 --> 22:48.576
Four meters, getting closer
to dolphin on starboard side.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.745
Three meters, holding.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.747
Three meters, dude?

22:52.789 --> 22:55.834
Three meters,
dolphin coming astern.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.961
That's not three meters,
that is one meter.

22:58.003 --> 22:59.796
One meter, getting closer,
one meter.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.756
One meter, one meter...
she's gonna hit it, man.

23:01.798 --> 23:04.175
We're gonna hit, we're gonna
hit, kick ahead, kick ahead.

23:04.217 --> 23:06.845
Uh-oh...
oh sh--.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.810
You hit it!

23:20.775 --> 23:21.735
Three meters,
dolphin coming astern.

23:23.611 --> 23:24.863
That's not three meters.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.823
One meter...
she's gonna hit it, man.

23:26.865 --> 23:28.825
We're gonna hit, we're gonna
hit, kick ahead, kick ahead.

23:28.867 --> 23:31.161
Uh-oh... oh sh--.

23:40.170 --> 23:41.713
You hit it!

23:41.755 --> 23:43.131
Jesus Christ.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.804
No captain wants
to hit anything,

23:49.846 --> 23:51.723
and this is the first
time in my career

23:51.765 --> 23:53.099
I've ever touched anything.

23:53.141 --> 23:55.727
Not okay.

23:55.769 --> 23:57.354
This heaving line
is put up in between this.

23:57.395 --> 23:58.897
Nice.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.732
-Mzi!
-Mzi, go to.

24:00.774 --> 24:02.609
To the stern.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.069
Make sure I got fenders out.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.237
They did so much work,
how wonderful it is.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.322
How cute!

24:07.364 --> 24:09.616
Salads, salads.

24:09.657 --> 24:11.326
All good with the fenders.

24:13.036 --> 24:15.413
This one?

24:15.455 --> 24:16.831
Am I clear of those buoys?

24:16.873 --> 24:17.999
Yeah, you're clear, all clear.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.043
Fenders are all out.

24:20.085 --> 24:21.127
Rosé, white wine?

24:21.169 --> 24:24.422
I'm doing seltzer.

24:24.464 --> 24:25.715
Throw your lines ashore.

24:29.928 --> 24:31.179
Bow spring's on.

24:31.221 --> 24:32.972
<i>Stern, get your lines in.</i>

24:33.014 --> 24:34.307
Wow!

24:34.349 --> 24:35.350
Can you get this one ashore?

24:37.310 --> 24:38.978
Tie that down, lock it down.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.106
Throw your lines ashore,
I don't wanna touch the dock

24:41.147 --> 24:44.359
until you have your
lines ashore.

24:44.401 --> 24:46.277
Okay now put this one.

24:46.319 --> 24:47.904
Hurry, throw it.

24:51.908 --> 24:53.702
There's urgency, yeah?

24:53.743 --> 24:55.161
It's a bit of a sh--show.

24:55.203 --> 24:56.830
I think the issue with the
deck team at the moment

24:56.871 --> 24:58.373
is that there's no leadership.

24:58.415 --> 24:59.916
It's just so frustrating,

24:59.958 --> 25:02.127
because this environment
makes it quite difficult

25:02.168 --> 25:04.838
to make progress.

25:04.879 --> 25:05.839
Yeah.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.298
Woohoo, crispy yum-yum!

25:07.340 --> 25:10.343
Get the line out of the water,
pull it in fast.

25:12.887 --> 25:14.139
Get that line out of the water.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.307
And now pull it in,
now tie it up.

25:16.349 --> 25:17.767
Thank you.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.394
When you approach a dock,

25:19.436 --> 25:21.813
you expect the bosun to have
everything in order...

25:21.855 --> 25:23.815
all the lines in order,
the fenders down,

25:23.857 --> 25:26.026
everything ready
to proceed to the dock.

25:26.067 --> 25:30.280
But this was mismanaged,
lines were everywhere.

25:30.321 --> 25:32.991
Raygan doesn't know her job.

25:33.033 --> 25:36.411
I'm all set, you can
just work your lines.

25:36.453 --> 25:37.746
Thank you.

25:37.787 --> 25:39.789
It is so hot in here.

25:39.831 --> 25:40.999
I'm cold.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.042
No, you must be nuts, babe.

25:42.083 --> 25:43.293
I'd lose it as a chef, then.

25:43.335 --> 25:45.045
I have lost it.

25:45.086 --> 25:46.796
Lost what?

25:57.390 --> 26:01.144
I'd like to think that Dave
respects my wishes

26:01.186 --> 26:04.230
in terms of not telling
the crew about us.

26:04.272 --> 26:06.358
I can tell just by
looking at Dave

26:06.399 --> 26:09.069
that it's eating
him away inside,

26:09.110 --> 26:10.779
and that's not what I want.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.238
I don't wanna hurt him.

26:17.327 --> 26:18.787
It's not!

26:18.828 --> 26:20.080
But I kind of
do feel like

26:20.121 --> 26:21.748
I'm treading on
eggshells around him.

26:24.459 --> 26:29.339
So, we have a blackened
cod tacos, gluten-free.

26:29.381 --> 26:32.050
-Ooh, fish tacos!
-Yes.

26:32.092 --> 26:33.802
Nice job, Storm.

26:33.843 --> 26:36.388
I just wanna get...
look at the boat.

26:36.429 --> 26:38.848
Obviously there is
a few things

26:38.890 --> 26:41.267
that could have
been a bit better.

26:41.309 --> 26:42.268
Did I hit the dolphin?

26:42.310 --> 26:43.478
We only slightly touched,

26:43.520 --> 26:45.438
and there was no damage,
so it was okay.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.815
-Okay.
-It was okay.

26:46.856 --> 26:49.234
Yeah, that's not
happening again.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.860
We docked safe,
so that's the main thing.

26:54.989 --> 26:57.492
Oh sh--, look at those ribs.

26:57.534 --> 27:02.831
Oh, my God,
these tacos are unreal.

27:02.872 --> 27:04.916
Food is my love language,
and this is love.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.001
Oh!

27:06.042 --> 27:08.253
Guys, are you feeling creative?

27:13.299 --> 27:14.801
[gasps]

27:14.843 --> 27:16.511
Ooh!

27:16.553 --> 27:17.929
That table.

27:21.850 --> 27:23.226
Babe, that's 'cause
you work there.

27:27.564 --> 27:30.316
Do you guys dip your
pizza in ranch?

27:30.358 --> 27:32.902
Let me return back
to the Hobbit hole.

27:32.944 --> 27:34.863
He makes so much food,
which is lovely.

27:38.950 --> 27:41.953
Just gonna knock out these...

27:41.995 --> 27:43.413
Hey, guess what,
I have good news.

27:43.455 --> 27:46.124
I just got permission to take
the tender down.

27:46.166 --> 27:47.542
Yeehaw!

27:47.584 --> 27:49.294
That'd be awesome.

27:49.336 --> 27:50.295
Yeah, that's good.

27:50.337 --> 27:52.130
Yeah.

27:52.172 --> 27:54.132
Deck, deck, we are going to
get the tender into the water.

27:54.174 --> 27:55.967
Copy that.

27:56.009 --> 27:57.969
What drinks can I get you guys
for the cooler that you want?

27:58.011 --> 27:59.471
Yeah, that's all I care about.

27:59.512 --> 28:00.555
-Let's get some Strongbow.
-Okay.

28:00.597 --> 28:02.265
Let's take some, like, cider.

28:02.307 --> 28:04.476
How were the raspberry ones,
any good, or no?

28:04.517 --> 28:06.519
Could you just pack a
cooler box, please?

28:06.561 --> 28:08.355
That's... I'm literally, like,
talking about it right now...

28:08.396 --> 28:09.981
I need you to do it right now.

28:10.023 --> 28:10.982
about what you guys
would like in the cooler.

28:11.024 --> 28:12.150
Oh, my God.

28:12.192 --> 28:14.027
There's structure that's needed.

28:14.069 --> 28:15.570
Because I think on a new team,
on a new boat, in a new area,

28:15.612 --> 28:17.322
there's so many different
things

28:17.364 --> 28:18.573
that can be happening
at the same time.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.283
I didn't pack this,
I was literally

28:20.325 --> 28:22.869
coming down to redo it,
so I got you.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.913
There's a pace at which you
need to do things,

28:24.954 --> 28:27.415
so Jason coming from
his experience on his boat

28:27.457 --> 28:31.002
to this boat, like, things
need to happen quite fast.

28:31.044 --> 28:33.546
He's ----ing sucking his
thumb and doing...

28:33.588 --> 28:35.423
he's packing the cooler box,

28:35.465 --> 28:38.343
but, like, what should take
two minutes

28:38.385 --> 28:40.261
is taking 25 ----ing minutes.

28:40.303 --> 28:42.013
It's like I'm gonna pass out.

28:42.055 --> 28:43.473
Just do it, just go to bed.

28:43.515 --> 28:46.017
Just actually go to bed,
and just see what happens.

28:46.059 --> 28:48.937
We can rotate every 30 minutes.

28:48.978 --> 28:50.313
I just farted.

28:50.355 --> 28:52.691
Kyle, how does it just
slip out like that?

28:52.732 --> 28:54.359
It's one of the things
I grew up with.

28:54.401 --> 28:56.194
Every time I laugh, I fart.

28:56.236 --> 28:57.529
I think because the two holes
are clenching at the same time,

28:57.570 --> 28:58.988
I don't know.

28:59.030 --> 29:01.157
Your butthole literally
needs a plug.

29:01.199 --> 29:02.575
-[farts]
-Kyle!

29:02.617 --> 29:05.036
-We happy?
-Yeah, you are happy.

29:10.667 --> 29:13.378
Oh, yeah.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.130
Mzi, I'm telling you,
if you don't follow the rules,

29:15.171 --> 29:17.090
life gets a lot better.

29:18.466 --> 29:19.551
Food.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.636
Raygan, Raygan, Jason.

29:21.678 --> 29:23.596
<i>What should I do?</i>

29:26.141 --> 29:28.393
Well, you make that call, bosun.

29:28.435 --> 29:30.103
That's your job.

29:30.145 --> 29:31.563
The docking was a mess,

29:31.604 --> 29:34.399
and that starts with
the bosun, the leadership.

29:34.441 --> 29:37.444
You have to be able
to lead your team.

29:37.485 --> 29:40.030
Where's your schedule?
I need that.

29:40.071 --> 29:42.449
Do they know to put
the toys out yet?

29:42.490 --> 29:44.325
We're just ready to be
in the water now.

29:44.367 --> 29:54.377
This docking was the straw
that broke the camel's back.

30:07.766 --> 30:09.601
This is beautiful.

30:12.729 --> 30:14.606
-Is it cute?
-It is very cute.

30:14.647 --> 30:17.025
Look at that city over
there, actually, though.

30:17.067 --> 30:18.985
-I know, it's gorgeous.
-That is gorgeous.

30:19.027 --> 30:20.153
It's so pretty.

30:21.571 --> 30:22.906
What can I help with, guys?

30:22.947 --> 30:25.784
The Moroccan stools,
all the buffet things,

30:25.825 --> 30:27.869
and we need to start
setting for dinner.

30:27.911 --> 30:29.454
Raygan, Raygan, Storm.

30:29.496 --> 30:30.997
Tender incoming.

30:31.039 --> 30:32.540
Just take, like, all the
fairy lights we've got up there,

30:32.582 --> 30:35.418
all the candles, lanterns.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.545
And I'll do the cabin turn-down.

30:37.587 --> 30:38.713
What's gone here?

30:41.800 --> 30:43.760
I need to get changed.

30:48.765 --> 30:50.475
Woo!

30:53.186 --> 30:54.729
All right, guys,
let me give you a hand.

30:54.771 --> 30:57.774
-Vodka, lychee, raspberry.
-Is this...

30:57.816 --> 31:00.985
Shot, shot, shots!

31:01.027 --> 31:03.071
Oh!
You scared me.

31:03.113 --> 31:04.989
Sorry.

31:05.031 --> 31:05.990
Do you want me
to put that in laundry?

31:06.032 --> 31:08.034
Yeah, okay.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.501
My underwear.

31:23.008 --> 31:24.467
Dude, I need a shower.

31:28.138 --> 31:30.098
My life's just
literally doing laps.

31:32.684 --> 31:34.060
Are these going up or down?

31:34.102 --> 31:35.562
They're going up, please.

31:35.603 --> 31:38.064
Gotcha.

31:38.106 --> 31:39.941
The guests were,
like, we want Moroccan.

31:39.983 --> 31:41.568
I'm like, sick.

31:41.609 --> 31:43.653
I've spent a little bit
of time in Morocco,

31:43.695 --> 31:45.572
and I did a lot of outside
cooking there.

31:45.613 --> 31:47.991
If I could do it properly,
I'd dig a hole in some mud

31:48.033 --> 31:50.118
and chuck some charcoals
in there, you know?

31:50.160 --> 31:51.745
But obviously I can't do that
because I'm on a yacht,

31:51.786 --> 31:54.748
so I'm just gonna braise it down
in a big pot

31:54.789 --> 31:57.208
and add the spices with the
fruit and some fresh herbs.

31:57.250 --> 31:58.877
That's it... tagine.

32:00.837 --> 32:02.881
Is my wife still down here?

32:02.922 --> 32:04.799
Honey, I'm home.

32:04.841 --> 32:06.801
I've been ----ing cooking and
cleaning and doing everything...

32:06.843 --> 32:07.802
What are...
where have you been?

32:07.844 --> 32:08.887
I've missed you.

32:08.928 --> 32:10.722
You're just too distracting.

32:11.765 --> 32:13.641
[laughing]

32:13.683 --> 32:15.643
I'm not on a hunt for anyone,
but if someone, like, pops up,

32:15.685 --> 32:17.520
I'm not gonna
say, "Oh, God, no."

32:17.562 --> 32:19.606
But also, like, there's a whole
lot of things that come into it.

32:19.647 --> 32:20.982
They've gotta be, like,
really cool,

32:21.024 --> 32:22.776
they've also gotta
have a good family,

32:22.817 --> 32:24.652
they've gotta have a really
good friendship group.

32:24.694 --> 32:26.571
There's a whole thing to it.

32:26.613 --> 32:28.156
Also, I've only just
broken up with my ex,

32:28.198 --> 32:31.743
so I'm not really rushing
to get in with anyone.

32:31.785 --> 32:35.747
I'm just happy to ride the
train, see where I'm going.

32:35.789 --> 32:37.207
Don't leave!

32:40.251 --> 32:41.753
My hair's a disaster.

32:41.795 --> 32:43.254
Okay, let's rumble.

32:43.296 --> 32:46.174
-Go time.
-Wow!

32:46.216 --> 32:48.843
Who designs all of this?

32:48.885 --> 32:50.136
My ass so fat.

32:55.225 --> 32:57.894
Sorry, real quick, sorry.

32:57.936 --> 33:00.146
Ah! [bleep]

33:00.188 --> 33:01.231
Where is it?

33:01.272 --> 33:02.232
Cheers.

33:02.273 --> 33:04.776
The sh-- is not here.

33:04.818 --> 33:07.237
----ing wow.

33:07.278 --> 33:09.322
She's pretty much completely
different at this point.

33:09.364 --> 33:11.783
When we were on our
previous boat together,

33:11.825 --> 33:13.368
she was, like, always
coming to find me,

33:13.410 --> 33:15.328
we were always together,
you know.

33:19.374 --> 33:21.251
You know my hand was in the door
there, when you slammed it?

33:21.292 --> 33:23.128
Oh, sorry, I didn't know.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.921
I'm afraid she's
regretting everything

33:24.963 --> 33:26.840
that's happened between us,

33:26.881 --> 33:29.092
because she's making me feel,
like, absolutely worthless.

33:29.134 --> 33:31.594
I've fallen in love with
someone and all I wanna do

33:31.636 --> 33:36.307
is talk to her about it,
but I can't.

33:36.349 --> 33:38.059
You guys wanna sit down?

33:38.101 --> 33:40.395
I am going to die.

33:40.437 --> 33:42.272
Wow, look at that.

33:42.313 --> 33:45.650
Look at all the different colors
of everything, and the plating.

33:45.692 --> 33:46.985
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, Dave.

33:47.027 --> 33:48.069
This is the man!

33:48.111 --> 33:49.654
-How you doing?
-Thank you.

33:49.696 --> 33:50.655
The myth.

33:50.697 --> 33:51.698
It looks amazing.

33:51.740 --> 33:53.783
We've got a prawn tagine,

33:53.825 --> 33:55.994
and then we've got some grilled
aubergine with some feta.

33:56.036 --> 33:58.621
Then we've got
slow-roast lamb rack,

33:58.663 --> 34:00.040
and then a nice, light couscous.

34:00.081 --> 34:01.166
-You're amazing, thank you.
-You really are.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.667
Thank you.

34:02.709 --> 34:05.086
All right, enjoy, guys.
Thank you so much.

34:05.128 --> 34:06.838
I've never had lamb,
it's so good.

34:06.880 --> 34:07.964
Holy cow.

34:08.006 --> 34:09.341
You're trying so
many new things.

34:09.382 --> 34:10.842
Yeah, you guys, my mind's blown.

34:10.884 --> 34:12.844
[silverware clatters]

34:12.886 --> 34:14.929
I can't do anything right.

34:14.971 --> 34:16.181
You did last night.

34:16.222 --> 34:19.726
Yee-haw!

34:19.768 --> 34:24.272
Like, these panties, oh,
my gosh, they're actually, ugh.

34:24.314 --> 34:26.274
Are we happy penis,
everything fine?

34:26.316 --> 34:28.109
Did you just say "happy penis?"

34:28.151 --> 34:29.194
-What did you just say?
-No, "happiness."

34:29.235 --> 34:31.029
-Oh.
-Oh!

34:31.071 --> 34:32.072
Kyle!

34:32.113 --> 34:33.865
Your ears are playing with you.

34:33.907 --> 34:36.159
Obviously, I am a service queen,

34:36.201 --> 34:40.288
but on the interior, we all have
these excellent strengths.

34:40.330 --> 34:42.791
Tash has great
cocktail-making skills,

34:42.832 --> 34:46.127
Nat is excellent at laundry,
excellent at housekeeping.

34:46.169 --> 34:47.962
I'm all for supporting the team,

34:48.004 --> 34:51.925
but if the tip is whopping,
it will be because of us.

34:51.966 --> 34:53.051
Goddamn, Kyle.

34:53.093 --> 34:54.344
[laughing]

34:55.887 --> 34:57.222
Happy days.

34:57.263 --> 34:58.431
Can we eat dessert upstairs?

34:58.473 --> 35:00.100
Yeah, I'll bring it outside.

35:00.141 --> 35:01.476
Thank you.

35:01.518 --> 35:03.144
Housekeeping!

35:03.186 --> 35:05.063
Okay, come on, guys.

35:05.105 --> 35:06.356
Oh, hi, babe,
we're ready for desserts.

35:06.398 --> 35:08.316
Okay.

35:08.358 --> 35:09.734
They'd like to eat it on the
sundeck, so what should we do?

35:09.776 --> 35:11.319
-Take it up to present it...
-Yeah.

35:11.361 --> 35:14.781
-And then serve it up there?
-Sure.

35:14.823 --> 35:16.408
This is exactly what I wanted.

35:19.869 --> 35:21.746
What's this,
some more hippie sh--?

35:21.788 --> 35:22.747
Yeah, sit down.

35:22.789 --> 35:23.790
That's so pretty.

35:23.832 --> 35:25.333
Yeah, look at this!

35:25.375 --> 35:28.878
So, we've got white chocolate,
lime, and ginger.

35:28.920 --> 35:31.423
And then the top

35:31.464 --> 35:32.882
is, like, basically
a double mirror glaze.

35:32.924 --> 35:34.968
-Do we dive in?
-Tuck in!

35:36.177 --> 35:37.846
Wow.

35:37.887 --> 35:39.264
That just rocked my world.

35:41.224 --> 35:43.476
Thank you, Dave.

35:43.518 --> 35:44.769
Good night, everyone.

35:44.811 --> 35:46.438
See you.

35:46.479 --> 35:48.398
I think we're all
a little pooped.

35:49.482 --> 35:51.067
Em, where are you going?

35:51.109 --> 35:53.028
Fine, we'll go to my room.

35:53.069 --> 35:54.863
Toodle-oo.

35:56.531 --> 35:58.366
Oh, all that type
of stuff, okay.

35:58.408 --> 36:00.785
Today was actually
a terrible day.

36:00.827 --> 36:02.912
I lost a day of charter.

36:04.873 --> 36:06.374
And she's still rich.

36:06.416 --> 36:08.501
I wanna take this pillow,
I wanna hit you so hard

36:08.543 --> 36:10.795
across the face right now, and
hope that you go

36:10.837 --> 36:13.506
flying there onto the pole.

36:19.554 --> 36:29.731
This is my guy?

36:29.773 --> 36:39.824
This is my guy?

36:39.824 --> 36:49.751
This is my guy?

36:49.793 --> 36:59.844
This is my guy?

36:59.844 --> 37:09.771
This is my guy?

37:09.813 --> 37:19.864
This is my guy?

37:19.864 --> 37:29.791
This is my guy?

37:29.833 --> 37:39.884
This is my guy?

37:39.884 --> 37:49.811
This is my guy?

37:49.853 --> 37:59.904
This is my guy?

37:59.904 --> 38:09.831
This is my guy?

38:09.873 --> 38:19.924
This is my guy?

38:19.924 --> 38:30.894
This is my guy?

38:36.649 --> 38:38.943
Honestly, what's going on
with my fork situation?

38:42.238 --> 38:46.034
Hello, good morning, darling
heart of love and light.

38:46.076 --> 38:47.535
Table looks great.

38:47.577 --> 38:48.953
You look great.

38:55.168 --> 38:56.378
Thanks.

39:19.234 --> 39:20.193
Good morning.

39:20.235 --> 39:21.569
Hello, how are you?

39:21.611 --> 39:23.113
Is there any way
I could get a coffee?

39:23.154 --> 39:24.406
What kind of coffee
would you like?

39:24.447 --> 39:25.490
Just black.

39:27.158 --> 39:29.160
-Oh, my gosh, it's so cute.
-Yeah.

39:32.288 --> 39:33.623
Yeah.

39:33.665 --> 39:37.127
Storm, Storm, can you
meet me on the bridge?

39:37.168 --> 39:38.294
<i>Copy, Captain.</i>

39:38.336 --> 39:39.379
Have we got a soft one?

39:39.421 --> 39:40.797
-Yeah, right here.
-Okay.

39:40.839 --> 39:43.299
And just one more
scrambled and salmon.

39:47.721 --> 39:48.680
Good morning, Captain.

39:48.722 --> 39:50.557
I just wanna have a quick chat.

39:50.598 --> 39:53.560
That's actually the perfect way
to do it, thank you so much.

39:53.601 --> 39:55.103
-Thank you, I appreciate it.
-Oh, you're welcome.

39:55.145 --> 39:57.147
When I was coming in,

39:57.188 --> 39:59.649
I touched the dolphins on
the starboard side.

39:59.691 --> 40:01.151
Okay.

40:01.192 --> 40:02.235
Could you see down that
side of the boat?

40:02.277 --> 40:03.445
-No.
-Okay.

40:03.486 --> 40:04.821
So, when we cleared,
we had at least

40:04.863 --> 40:06.281
five meters before
we'd past the buoy .

40:06.322 --> 40:08.033
Okay.

40:08.074 --> 40:09.075
But as far as when I was
talking to you...

40:09.117 --> 40:10.285
-Yeah.
-We were clear.

40:10.326 --> 40:12.162
Yeah, and I love how
you took charge.

40:12.203 --> 40:15.040
From what I've seen, you
understand how critical it is

40:15.081 --> 40:17.667
-to get lines ashore.
-Yes.

40:17.709 --> 40:19.252
Yeah, I just wanted
to acknowledge that.

40:19.294 --> 40:20.337
Anytime, Sandy.

40:20.378 --> 40:21.588
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

40:21.629 --> 40:23.173
All right.

40:24.758 --> 40:29.596
He makes this toast... mm.

40:29.637 --> 40:32.140
Is there something that you
asked for that you didn't get?

40:32.182 --> 40:33.350
No.

40:35.268 --> 40:38.396
Like, I leave
clothes out everywhere...

40:43.777 --> 40:45.195
So, are you excited to leave us?

40:45.236 --> 40:46.613
No! I'm so sad.

40:46.654 --> 40:48.448
This one's that end.

40:48.490 --> 40:51.576
This one's murder to try and
find which way's which.

40:54.329 --> 40:56.122
All right, we did it!

40:56.164 --> 40:58.583
Change quick, because I think
they're leaving shortly.

41:04.547 --> 41:06.341
Has anyone started
sweeping the cabins yet?

41:06.383 --> 41:08.134
Every single cabin's done,
the master's packed,

41:08.176 --> 41:09.427
all the guests are packed,

41:09.469 --> 41:11.262
all the towels have been
taken, everything.

41:11.304 --> 41:14.683
All crew, all crew, meet on
the dock for guest departure.

41:14.724 --> 41:17.769
I haven't had shoes on in,
like, three days.

41:17.811 --> 41:21.398
At the end of every
charter it's just, like, woohoo.

41:21.439 --> 41:23.733
This charter's been fairly
intense for the deck crew,

41:23.775 --> 41:26.736
so definitely keen to sink
a couple tonight.

41:26.778 --> 41:28.613
-It's been real!
-You are a stud.

41:28.655 --> 41:30.407
-Thanks, man.
-Thank you so much.

41:30.448 --> 41:33.326
Honestly, it was
an unreal experience,

41:33.368 --> 41:35.745
and you guys are all so amazing.

41:35.787 --> 41:37.914
The only complaint
would probably be

41:37.956 --> 41:39.624
keeping people waiting.

41:39.666 --> 41:42.293
Before you get in,
let us get a ladder down.

41:42.335 --> 41:44.212
They're literally
waiting around.

41:44.254 --> 41:46.131
-Thank you, I appreciate it.
-Thank you so much, yes.

41:46.172 --> 41:47.424
-And this is for you...
-It was a pleasure.

41:47.465 --> 41:48.466
-Or for the crew.
-Yeah, thank you.

41:48.508 --> 41:49.759
You're welcome.

41:49.801 --> 41:53.138
-All right, bye!
-Bye, we'll miss you.

41:53.179 --> 41:55.640
-Well done, team.
-You're welcome.

41:58.518 --> 42:01.396
Ah, okay.

42:01.438 --> 42:03.398
Ten seconds.

42:03.440 --> 42:04.816
Are you excited for your
drinky-wink tonight?

42:06.943 --> 42:10.405
All crew, all crew,
let's meet in the main salon

42:10.447 --> 42:12.323
for our tip meeting.

42:12.365 --> 42:14.617
So, charter number two down.

42:14.659 --> 42:17.537
Deck, you guys
are finding your way.

42:17.579 --> 42:19.706
I appreciate the amount of
work that you're putting in.

42:19.748 --> 42:22.459
There's some things
we're still gonna work on.

42:22.500 --> 42:24.919
This was a very
difficult docking.

42:24.961 --> 42:27.505
It took the lines a really
long time to get across,

42:27.547 --> 42:29.841
I know the lines went
in the water.

42:29.883 --> 42:33.219
I actually touched
the mooring buoys.

42:33.261 --> 42:34.596
That can never happen.

42:37.015 --> 42:39.309
Interior, as always,

42:39.351 --> 42:42.187
you guys did an amazing job,
so thank you.

42:42.228 --> 42:44.981
Chef Dave, I haven't
had a chef like you

42:45.023 --> 42:47.609
in a very, very long time.

42:47.650 --> 42:48.610
Thank you.

42:48.651 --> 42:50.278
Great job overall.

42:50.320 --> 42:51.654
I gotta tell you, like,
this was a great charter.

42:51.696 --> 42:55.617
So, with that,
this tip is $19,000...

42:55.658 --> 42:59.371
$1,727 per person.

42:59.412 --> 43:00.455
Cool!

43:00.497 --> 43:01.748
That's a great tip, right?

43:01.790 --> 43:04.751
-So, cheers, everybody.
-Cheers!

43:04.793 --> 43:05.752
Captain.

43:05.794 --> 43:09.673
Cheers.

43:09.714 --> 43:13.843
Anyway, thank you very much, and
you know, enjoy your night out.

43:13.885 --> 43:17.764
-Thanks, Cap.
-Thank you!

43:17.806 --> 43:18.807
All right, let's break.

43:21.559 --> 43:22.686
What's up, homie?

43:22.727 --> 43:24.020
We're going to tag team this.

43:24.062 --> 43:25.522
Yeah.

43:28.733 --> 43:31.528
Raygan, Raygan, can you
please come to the bridge?

43:31.569 --> 43:32.737
Raygan to the bridge.
