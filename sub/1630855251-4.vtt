WEBVTT

00:06.480 --> 00:08.800
Deadloch is in mourning!

00:08.800 --> 00:11.440
Two kings of this town are dead.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.840
[screams]

00:12.840 --> 00:14.640
[Sven] The lake body
has been identified.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.520
- Is it Sam O'Dwyer?
- It is.

00:16.520 --> 00:20.000
The tongue is missing, Detective.
They are all connected.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.680
Five years ago Deadloch's mayor,
Rod Dixon,

00:22.680 --> 00:25.000
washed up dead on the same beach
as Trent Latham.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.640
His tongue was also missing.

00:26.640 --> 00:29.560
- Who's working the case?
- [Dulcie] At the moment, me.

00:29.560 --> 00:30.840
Dulce, you promised.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.759
It is just until
the lead detective arrives.

00:32.759 --> 00:35.920
He... He...
The detective, comes tomorrow.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.040
Oh, OK.

00:37.040 --> 00:40.520
Anyway, I've just about chewed
your fucking ear off, haven't I,

00:40.520 --> 00:41.880
all night?

00:41.880 --> 00:43.880
I fucking killed my partner!

00:43.880 --> 00:46.520
Bushy.
[tearfully] He got eaten by a croc.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.800
I was supposed to be with him
when it happened.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.840
[Dulcie] Deadloch has a serial killer.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.520
I need an outsider's perspective.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.480
I need a partner.

00:55.480 --> 00:59.400
Trent, Gavin and Rod
have pentobarbital in their system.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.160
That's a tranquiliser.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.240
Men don't poison.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.000
We're looking for a woman.

01:07.640 --> 01:12.200
[Claire] Dulcie, you say that your work
is very stressful at the moment.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.920
Why is that?

01:13.920 --> 01:17.280
Because I'm working
a murder investigation, Claire.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.560
Mmm! A murder investigation.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.560
Alright, let's talk about that.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.320
I can't talk about it, Claire.

01:25.320 --> 01:28.280
Why not? What's the block there
for you, Dulcie?

01:28.280 --> 01:30.120
The law's the block, Claire.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.520
[Claire] But communication
is key in a relationship, isn't it?

01:33.520 --> 01:36.800
Exactly. She didn't even tell me
our friend's dad was dead.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.680
Well, it's... it's not procedure, so...

01:40.680 --> 01:42.800
Mmm.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.280
I'm moving back to the shack.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.560
I'm confronting my fears.

01:51.680 --> 01:53.600
Like someone eating a hot chicken roll

01:53.600 --> 01:55.600
after a bout of gastro

01:55.600 --> 01:57.720
from the hot chicken roll.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.360
You know?

01:59.360 --> 02:01.200
I have to open the shop up.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.600
Oh.

02:04.840 --> 02:06.440
Alright.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.320
Sprog.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.520
See ya round, Bushy.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.160
♪ ♪

02:40.600 --> 02:43.440
♪ ♪

02:59.880 --> 03:02.360
I've been ordered by Mayorette Rahme

03:02.360 --> 03:05.080
to put the footy club memorial
of my mates in the bin.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.360
Oh, Mr McGangus,
I'm so sorry about that.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.880
That woman has no respect, OK?

03:09.880 --> 03:11.640
We are in mourning.

03:11.640 --> 03:14.680
Not that you would know,
with this festival of tit art going on.

03:14.680 --> 03:15.920
Good men are dead,

03:15.920 --> 03:18.560
yet our mayorette wants us to
go and see a show

03:18.560 --> 03:20.840
that teaches people how to...

03:20.840 --> 03:23.600
wank off a carrot.
It just begs belief.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.040
I can tell you now the late mayor,
Rod Dixon,

03:26.040 --> 03:28.400
if he could see how his wife
and his successor

03:28.400 --> 03:31.320
are using his money to destroy this town

03:31.320 --> 03:34.040
he would be rolling
in his pauper's grave.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.040
His pauper's grave?

03:36.040 --> 03:38.920
Yes. Like, his pauper's grave.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.520
Thank you. Thanks, that was...
No, paup...

03:40.520 --> 03:43.160
That was good. Thank you.
I meant in a way... MEE-gan!

03:43.160 --> 03:44.320
Hey!

03:46.280 --> 03:48.200
Cath, let's turn to you.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.560
You say that you're concerned
about how this lack of communication

03:51.560 --> 03:54.160
is impacting on Dulcie's health.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.640
Claire, the case is confidential.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.880
Still a choice, Dulcie.

03:57.880 --> 03:58.920
Tch.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.480
[inhales]

04:02.600 --> 04:04.600
Is that all it is for you, Cath?

04:04.600 --> 04:08.320
No, well, also I feel very triggered.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.880
It reminds me of how her behaviour
in Sydney made me feel.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.960
Would you agree, though,
that your life here in Deadloch

04:14.960 --> 04:17.000
is different from your life in Sydney?

04:17.000 --> 04:20.760
- Very different.
- So here's your homework, Cath.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.320
How about you try to see
this murder investigation

04:24.320 --> 04:26.160
as unusual circumstances

04:26.160 --> 04:28.880
that need to be approached in a new way?

04:28.880 --> 04:34.080
Dulcie, carve out some time
in that double murder investigation

04:34.080 --> 04:38.520
to really reconnect with Cath.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.480
What's something that
brings you both together?

04:41.480 --> 04:43.720
- Hikes.
- Fucking.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.320
[Megan] Detective? Detective.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.240
Detective, Jeremy Hodge, the Bugle.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.440
Are there any updates
on the Latham case, Detective?

04:51.440 --> 04:53.040
What? Ah, no, Jeremy.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.200
Uh, but everything's cool.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.720
- We're onto it, so...
- Well, how, exactly...

04:55.720 --> 04:57.720
Detective, what do you have to say
to this morning's article?

04:57.720 --> 04:59.120
Ah, what... what article?

04:59.120 --> 05:00.920
In the Tribune, written by me.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.880
It suggests that you're not fit
to run this investigation,

05:02.880 --> 05:04.520
after you went on the record
with a journalist

05:04.520 --> 05:07.200
and badmouthed this beautiful town
and its hardworking residents.

05:07.200 --> 05:10.560
And then you accused your colleagues
of gross incompetence and bad hair.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.600
When the fuck did I say all that?

05:12.600 --> 05:14.520
Last night. To me.

05:14.520 --> 05:15.520
Who the fuck are you?

05:15.520 --> 05:18.920
- Detective, what measures...
- Megan Lang, I wrote the article.
If you remember, we also talked about...

05:18.920 --> 05:20.920
Ah no, no, I will not be taking
any questions at this time!

05:20.920 --> 05:23.200
- [both clamour]
- Alright, no more questions.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.480
Thank you. All done.

05:24.480 --> 05:26.520
Thank you. Have a lovely day.

05:26.520 --> 05:28.280
- Cheers. Bye, MEE-gan.
- [Megan] It's MEG-an!

05:28.280 --> 05:30.160
- Fucking...
- [Sven] Bye!

05:30.160 --> 05:31.760
- Fuck! Fuck.
- [Sven] Thanks.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.600
[exhales]

05:56.680 --> 05:58.840
There were journos
in that front bit before.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.640
Yeah, good morning
to you too, Detective.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.400
Don't worry, I didn't answer
any of their questions.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.600
I was out of there
quicker than an airport fuck.

06:05.680 --> 06:06.680
You look different.

06:06.680 --> 06:08.640
Yeah, you look...
you look different also.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.240
- Oh, yeah, I got clothes.
- Mm-hm.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.400
- A full-length pant, if you will.
- Mm-hm.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.560
Feel like a cheese toastie.
Oh, punch my tit.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.480
- No. I'm not punching...
- No, come on. Come on. Punch my...

06:16.480 --> 06:18.480
- I'm not going to do that.
- Come on. Go on.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.720
Did you do it? I don't know.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.440
- I didn't feel a thing.
- I did it. OK, good.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.280
Well, I'm glad to be of service.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.520
Did you speak to Commissioner Hastings?

06:25.520 --> 06:29.360
Oh, yeah, that dildo wants me to
apologise to fucking McGangus.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.680
Yeah, I spoke to the Commissioner too.

06:30.680 --> 06:33.000
- I tried to tell him about this...
- Oh, the old... [imitates choking]

06:33.000 --> 06:36.040
Yeah, no, that's the one,
and he told me that I was hysterical

06:36.040 --> 06:38.360
and ruled by the moon
and then he hung up on me.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.360
So, that's really nice to know,
that he's in our corner.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.920
Oh, my gosh, my mouth tastes
like a set of keys.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.360
Yeah, nah, that's just adrenaline.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.120
- You'll be OK, Collins.
- Mmm.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.960
Right, let's get this thing started,
shall we?

06:49.960 --> 06:51.520
I've started calling you Collins,
by the way.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.760
It's just a little nickname.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.920
OK. Alright.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.480
Is there anything that
you want me to call you?

06:57.480 --> 07:00.240
I can't nominate my own nickname.
I'm not Batman.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.600
Big Eyes! Sven!
Come on, get in here.

07:07.640 --> 07:09.440
- Yeah, so, look...
- So, what I'm about to say

07:09.440 --> 07:11.120
cannot leave...

07:11.120 --> 07:12.960
- Ah no, no, lesbians first.
- No, no, no, please.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.320
- After you. No, you go.
- [Eddie] OK.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.480
So, this morning a newspaper article
was published

07:17.480 --> 07:19.720
in which I was quoted
as saying some stuff.

07:19.720 --> 07:20.840
Yeah, we know.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.160
Yes, you referred to me
as "Sergeant Horsehair".

07:24.160 --> 07:25.760
- Oh, did I?
- Then you said that Abby looked like

07:25.760 --> 07:27.120
a traumatised bush baby

07:27.120 --> 07:29.560
and you called Sven "Sveg", so...

07:29.560 --> 07:31.880
OK, well in light of this new info,

07:31.880 --> 07:34.080
looks like last night
wasn't my best work.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.200
Full disclosure, I have been known

07:36.200 --> 07:39.800
to be a bit fiery
and impulsive sometimes.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.960
But, you know, look, that's all
water under the bridge.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.480
We're all OK.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.000
Right. You're up, sunshine.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.920
Right, thanks. So...

07:47.920 --> 07:50.200
It is very possible that

07:50.200 --> 07:52.920
the murders of
Trent Latham, Gavin Latham,

07:52.920 --> 07:55.120
Rod Dixon and Sam O'Dwyer

07:55.120 --> 07:57.880
are the actions of
a female serial killer

07:57.880 --> 08:00.440
who uses pentobarbital
to sedate her victims

08:00.440 --> 08:03.480
before she cuts out their tongues
and strangles them.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.960
- Oooh.
- [giggles excitedly]

08:04.960 --> 08:06.320
Yeah, so I think we can all agree that

08:06.320 --> 08:08.560
that's a fairly significant development
in the case.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.840
[Sven] It's enormous!

08:09.840 --> 08:12.160
Ma'ams, if you need anything,
Sven and I will be here for you.

08:12.160 --> 08:13.520
- Well, no, not anything.
- Day and night.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.880
- Not day or night, no.
- 24 hours.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.000
- We will sleep here in the office.
- I've got my own life going on.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.720
- On the couch, in shifts.
- My back's a little bit...
This is a job for me, so...

08:19.720 --> 08:21.240
[Dulcie] OK. Alright, good to know.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.160
Now, as far as the public are concerned,

08:24.160 --> 08:27.760
there are only two victims,
Trent and Gavin Latham

08:27.760 --> 08:32.200
And because my partner here referred to
the "Dead-C-word drug ring"

08:32.200 --> 08:34.760
quite a lot in her press interview

08:34.760 --> 08:37.760
everyone thinks that
the Latham murders are drug-related.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.200
Now, I have no memory of that,
but you're welcome.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.640
Right. So, luckily, no-one
has made the connection

08:42.640 --> 08:44.240
between the Latham murders

08:44.240 --> 08:47.120
and the historical murders of
Dixon and O'Dwyer.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.880
But if a connection is made

08:49.880 --> 08:55.240
it is a very short trip
from four victims to serial killer.

08:55.240 --> 08:59.240
And once that gets out there,
there is no going back.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.640
[Eddie] That's right.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.520
It's like trying to shove a fart
back up a bum.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.240
It's nigh-on impossible.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.400
The town will go bananas,
and the press will go bananas,

09:07.400 --> 09:09.520
not to mention the killer.

09:09.520 --> 09:13.440
Who knows what that sort of attention
will embolden her to do?

09:13.440 --> 09:16.200
I reckon she'll probably do
some more murders.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.640
Yep. Yep, that is... That's...

09:18.640 --> 09:20.840
That is also my instinct,
what I was implying.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.440
- Just off the top of my dome, there.
- Right.

09:22.440 --> 09:26.320
So... So no mention to anyone
outside of this room of serial killers.

09:26.320 --> 09:30.280
And no using she/ her pronouns
when discussing the killer.

09:30.280 --> 09:32.040
Yeah, you got that? Just use he/ him.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.280
No, use they/ them.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.440
That makes more sense.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.200
It always does.

09:36.200 --> 09:42.520
OK, our lady is most likely
white, over 25.

09:42.520 --> 09:46.880
Her access to pentobarbital suggests
she is or was a medical professional.

09:46.880 --> 09:49.880
Now for women,
murder is a means to an end

09:49.880 --> 09:52.520
to improve their situation
or the situation of others.

09:52.520 --> 09:55.440
And, as a rule, women,
even serial killers,

09:55.440 --> 09:56.840
target people they know.

09:56.840 --> 10:00.480
So here are some of the women
connected to our victims.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.600
Sharelle Muir, Vanessa Latham

10:03.600 --> 10:07.760
Victoria O'Dwyer, Skye O'Dwyer

10:07.760 --> 10:09.600
and Margaret Carruthers.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.880
Alright, how do we cut
this bint-list down?

10:12.880 --> 10:16.200
[Dulcie] Well, let's start with
her first kill.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.080
It will be her most personal.

10:19.080 --> 10:23.760
It will be formative in creating
her victim profile

10:23.760 --> 10:25.360
and her methodology.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.080
- So, what I was thinking was that...
- OK!

10:28.080 --> 10:30.640
So, first victim is Rod Dixon.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.040
So it was probably his missus.

10:32.040 --> 10:35.000
Which one of these
lovely, evil women is she?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.040
Ah, well, she is the one
holding the flan, Detective.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.200
But, yes, this is a good start point.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.440
Margaret could potentially lead us
to more viable suspects

10:43.440 --> 10:44.840
connected to Rod Dixon,

10:44.840 --> 10:46.480
like her staff, or colleagues.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.720
Ah, no. [scoffs] Excuse me.

10:47.720 --> 10:51.840
She is a white,
clearly over-25-year-old woman.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.520
Yeah, with a line of
gourmet seed crackers, so...

10:54.520 --> 10:56.600
[laughs] No, look, come on.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.000
You need to start seeing your lady
friends in a different light, Collins.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.360
- That's why you begged me to stay,
remember?
- Ah, that wasn't the reason.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.000
How is this Margaret
connected to the victims?

11:03.000 --> 11:06.040
Oh, Gavin and Trent used to work
at her husband's sawmill

11:06.040 --> 11:08.080
and Rod ran the football club with Sam.

11:08.080 --> 11:10.440
[Sven] She has an amazing recipe
for roast chicken.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.160
It's the best I've ever had.
You brine it with a syringe...

11:13.160 --> 11:14.320
No, OK. Not related.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.320
Look, Collins,

11:16.320 --> 11:18.880
let's go and give this linen witch
a razz. Come on.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.760
Come on.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.040
It's razzle dazzle time!

11:23.040 --> 11:24.600
Sven, why are you here?

11:24.600 --> 11:26.720
I don't know, I just kinda
got caught up in the energy.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.560
- Ma'am?
- Yeah?

11:28.560 --> 11:30.600
Sam O'Dwyer's toxicology reports
came through.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.560
OK, well note the level of
pentobarbital in Sam's file.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.280
We need to know where the killer's
accessing these kinds of dosages.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.120
Ma'am, he didn't have
any pentobarbital in his system.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.840
- He didn't?
- No ma'am.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.360
- That's...
- Odd?

11:43.360 --> 11:45.840
No, not odd. That's interesting.

11:45.840 --> 11:49.360
- Razzle dazzle!
- Yes, thank you. I heard you.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.800
Ah, talk to Aleyna and Cath.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.840
Get a list of anyone
they've prescribed pentobarbital to.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.680
- I'm on it, ma'am.
- No, Abby, you can't.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.480
You've got your
wedding makeup trial redo.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.160
- Oh, no! Why?
- Because you're getting married.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.800
Is it with Michelle again?
'Cause, like, clear the afternoon.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.520
- It's OK
- I'm sorry, ma'am

12:03.520 --> 12:04.960
- Razzle dazzle, come on!
- I've failed you!

12:04.960 --> 12:06.040
Yes! Yes!

12:06.040 --> 12:08.400
Detective, have you forgotten
there is that little apology

12:08.400 --> 12:10.280
you need to do first?

12:10.280 --> 12:12.960
Shove over. Get in your own seat!

12:30.040 --> 12:32.480
OK, Margaret can see us at 10.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.920
Go. Come on,
just get it over and done with.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.880
[phone rings]

12:42.200 --> 12:43.440
[Eddie] McGangus!

12:43.440 --> 12:45.120
[Woman] Preyard Pathology,
Dr King's extension.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.840
Yes, hello. It's Detective
Dulcie Collins, Deadloch Police.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.560
Hi, Detective, I'm Kate.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.400
I'm covering for James while
he's doing his TEDx talk in Perth.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.840
Ah, right. OK.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.440
Yeah, he let me know
from the airport at 6am.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.960
Anyway, I assume you're calling
about Sam O'Dwyer's toxology results?

12:59.960 --> 13:02.400
Yes, I am,
but if you're too busy, I can...

13:02.400 --> 13:06.200
No, have the tox report
here in front of me. Um...

13:06.200 --> 13:08.280
There's definitely no pentobarbital.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.280
Very high levels of alcohol, though.

13:10.280 --> 13:14.360
OK. Enough to
severely incapacitate him?

13:14.360 --> 13:18.640
No, but at the rear of the skull
there is a head wound.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.440
It's not dwelled on in the notes,
so I took another look at it.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.720
- You did?
- Yeah, of course.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.320
- Ah, I love you.
- Sorry?

13:26.320 --> 13:28.280
Sorry, nothing. No, yep.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.240
Well, I wondered if it was sustained

13:30.240 --> 13:31.880
when the body was dislodged
from the lake,

13:31.880 --> 13:34.120
but there's no damage
from that process at all,

13:34.120 --> 13:36.880
which I thought was remarkable.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.760
The injury is definitely sustained
before death.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.920
OK, so you think he was hit from behind.

13:42.920 --> 13:45.760
Yeah. And it was a decent whack, too.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.080
I think it would have
knocked him out cold.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.440
Um, ah, look, thanks, Kate.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.920
That is more helpful than
James has ever been.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.760
No probs. Have a good one.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.720
In conclusion,
I am very sorry for any offence

13:56.720 --> 13:59.680
I may have caused you
or your boat. Blah-blah.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.080
See? That wasn't that bad,
was it, cupcake?

14:02.080 --> 14:03.440
- Oh, fuck up, cunt.
- OK, alright.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.600
Off we pop. Thank you, Phil.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.960
Tell me, are you part of the order
to remove our memorial there, Sergeant?

14:07.960 --> 14:09.400
I'm not, Phil, no.

14:09.400 --> 14:12.400
But the tuna mornay containers
that people are leaving for Trent

14:12.400 --> 14:14.280
are starting to attract rats.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.800
Mike keeps running over them
with his ride-on mower.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.560
Fucking Margaret!

14:18.560 --> 14:22.200
Sitting high on her hill there, pulling
the strings of her little mayorette.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.440
Not a fan of Marg's, are you, Phil?

14:24.440 --> 14:27.160
Rod Dixon was like a father to me, OK?

14:27.160 --> 14:29.600
But Margie and me,
we've never seen eye-to-eye.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.760
Well, that makes sense. She's a fair bit
fucking taller than you, isn't she?

14:32.760 --> 14:35.440
- Oh, OK. Right.
- [Vanessa] Phil?

14:35.440 --> 14:38.760
Oh, yeah, just two seconds, Ness.
Stay there.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.360
Um, excuse me, ladies.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.680
Trent Latham's widow needs me

14:42.680 --> 14:45.840
and unlike you lot,
I care about what's going on here.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.560
[Vanessa] My bank account's
got no money in it.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.800
I'm sorry Phil, I can't pay rent.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.200
Trent's business cards keep declining.
I don't know what's happening.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.240
- I'm definitely using
the right PIN code.
- Oh, I can't watch.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.600
It's 020572,

14:57.600 --> 15:00.120
- 'cause it's the Rock's birthday.
- [Phil] Rock's birthday.
I know, I know.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.480
Hey! Detective!

15:04.480 --> 15:05.880
- Yes?
- Your mate?

15:05.880 --> 15:07.480
- [Dulcie] Oh, hi.
- Gidday Dulce, how's it going?

15:07.480 --> 15:08.920
What you said
about my good mate last night

15:08.920 --> 15:11.240
- is absolute bullshit, Detective.
- Hey, what the f...?

15:11.240 --> 15:13.000
You need to apologise to her.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.400
It's OK. It's alright, Skye.
The detective has apologised.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.400
- Yeah.
- What are you all doing here?

15:18.400 --> 15:21.600
Well, we heard some of the locals came
and laid tributes to Sam here, love,

15:21.600 --> 15:24.840
and Nadiyah suggested
we come and pay our respects too.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.680
Yeah, I've been trying to get them
to process their feelings.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.080
So far, no dice.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.080
The memorial's lovely, isn't it?

15:31.080 --> 15:34.760
It's nice to know that so many people
in Deadloch loved our Sam.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.920
[Eddie] But not more than
they love tuna mornay.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.840
It's like a two-to-one ratio,
photos of Sam and...

15:38.840 --> 15:41.040
- Alright.
- A lot of mornay.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.280
[Hunter] Hey, fucking O'Dwyer!

15:56.160 --> 15:58.200
Your grandpa was my under-10s coach.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.520
Taught me how to fucking kick and shit.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.800
He was a fucking dude, eh?

16:04.800 --> 16:07.600
Yeah. He was a fucking dude.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.040
Taught me everything I know
about footy, too.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.960
Hey, we're having
some fucking beers later.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.720
We're gonna try and kick down
a tree and shit.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.720
You can fucking come if you want.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.920
Yeah, I'll come.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.280
Fucking thanks.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.560
[squeaking]

16:23.560 --> 16:25.720
[Hunter] What the fuck? That's a rat!

16:25.720 --> 16:27.440
[squeaking]

16:27.440 --> 16:31.240
[Margaret] There's several
acceleration programs.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.120
It's got a wet lab,

16:33.120 --> 16:37.000
which I was very disappointed
to discover is not a dog. [chuckles]

16:37.000 --> 16:38.680
There's a wellness centre

16:38.680 --> 16:41.960
and the Margaret Carruthers
culinary kitchen.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.040
They just named it after me
so I'd buy them new hockey sticks.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.280
[both chuckle]

16:45.280 --> 16:46.640
Please, Fay, just have a seat.

16:46.640 --> 16:48.520
No, I'm good.

16:48.520 --> 16:52.000
Look, Aunty, there's a fencing pissed.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.280
Piste.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.280
[bang]

16:55.280 --> 16:56.880
Fuck!

16:56.880 --> 16:58.160
Sorry, my bad!

16:58.160 --> 17:00.600
[Margaret laughs]
Don't worry, darling!

17:00.600 --> 17:03.240
These old houses - indestructible!

17:03.240 --> 17:04.599
[laughs]

17:06.079 --> 17:08.040
Look, I'm not saying this

17:08.040 --> 17:10.680
just because they set of stoves
after me, Miranda.

17:10.680 --> 17:14.880
A Circle of Mercy education
is a golden ticket

17:14.880 --> 17:17.079
to do whatever you want
when you leave school.

17:17.079 --> 17:20.520
Come on, Fay,
help me twist your niece's arm.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.319
My girls make
their own decisions, Margaret.

17:23.319 --> 17:24.560
Quite right.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.000
Oh, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
that's my 10am arriving.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.640
I'm so sorry, ladies,
but I'm going to have to run.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.640
No, no, no, no, no,
sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.320
Take your time, hmm?

17:35.320 --> 17:37.880
Thank you so much, Mrs Carruthers.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.160
No, thank you, Miranda.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.640
You are such a special girl.

17:42.640 --> 17:47.160
I am giddy at the prospect of
helping you shape your future.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.480
We'll speak soon.

17:48.480 --> 17:51.280
Oh, I love your earrings.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.400
Who made those?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.880
Oh, they're by
this Aboriginal designer...

17:53.880 --> 17:56.720
Bring a card next time, hmm?

17:56.720 --> 17:58.320
Lovely to see you again, Fay.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.080
Give my regards to William.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.560
Your brother's still in Ubud,
isn't he?

18:02.560 --> 18:04.080
Mmm.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.160
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

18:09.160 --> 18:13.320
I know her family hasn't
been great to our mob, Aunty.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.560
But I reckon Mrs Carruthers
might be a good one.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.040
Hmm...

18:19.040 --> 18:20.800
- Did you just growl?
- No.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.040
I just find it interesting that

18:24.040 --> 18:26.680
Sam O'Dwyer didn't have
pentobarbital in his system.

18:26.680 --> 18:29.040
The killer didn't need to drug him.
She knocked him out.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.960
I don't know, donking him on the head
and hoping for the best?

18:31.960 --> 18:34.320
Seems very uncontrolled and unplanned.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.480
Yeah, 100%.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.560
- Right, what's our vibe in there?
- Our vibe?

18:38.560 --> 18:40.320
Yeah. We're proper partners now,

18:40.320 --> 18:42.800
so we need to firm up
our interview strategy, our flavour.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.800
You know, do we good cop/ bad cop her?

18:44.800 --> 18:46.440
- No, I don't...
- What about the old reach-around?

18:46.440 --> 18:47.760
That always worked for me up in Darwin.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.320
So you take the front bum,
I take the back bum...

18:49.320 --> 18:51.160
- No, stop, stop! I don't...
- Bit of a verbal double-P...

18:51.160 --> 18:52.800
- Stop! That...
- We get her with a phone book

18:52.800 --> 18:55.560
That is not an image that
I ever wanted to have in my head.

18:55.560 --> 18:59.960
I think that if we are seriously
considering Margaret as a suspect,

18:59.960 --> 19:04.200
then we need to understand
what she stood to gain by killing Rod.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.160
It's pretty fucking obvious.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.000
Look at this joint. This lady's loaded.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.240
She probably queefs gold.

19:10.240 --> 19:13.080
This is all old money.
Her family founded the town.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.800
Huh. Founded?

19:14.800 --> 19:17.640
I think the term you're looking for
is "colonised", Collins.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.640
[Dulcie] Yeah, good point.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.560
[Eddie] Alright, let's get in there,
see your mate.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.480
[Dulcie] No, she's not my mate!

19:26.440 --> 19:29.080
So, Dulce, you got any birthday plans
for tomorrow?

19:29.080 --> 19:34.320
Oh, just working,
then, uh, getting into my bed.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.280
Oh, sounds heaven. And how are
you going with the Haddick farm?

19:37.280 --> 19:39.800
Cath said they had a buyer drop out
because of the Latham murders.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.800
Ah, yeah, Marg,
that's a good segue, actually.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.320
Gavin and Trent. Shall we
talk about them for a little bit?

19:45.320 --> 19:47.560
Ah, OK, sorry.

19:47.560 --> 19:52.040
So, they both worked
at the sawmill until it closed.

19:52.040 --> 19:54.760
Why'd you shut it down?
Not a fan of wood?

19:54.760 --> 19:58.400
I love wood,
just prefer when it's a tree.

19:58.400 --> 20:03.040
Deadloch was founded by
my great, great-grandfather in 1865,

20:03.040 --> 20:07.040
and the Carruthers family has been
investing in its future ever since.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.520
My Rod's death made me think
about my own legacy.

20:10.520 --> 20:13.480
I decided to invest differently.

20:13.480 --> 20:19.800
My legacy will be the improved
future of the women here, Detective.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.680
They will finally shine.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.880
[snorts softly]

20:24.520 --> 20:25.800
Fuck. [chuckles]

20:25.800 --> 20:28.000
Pretty good stump speech.
Word-perfect, too.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.320
Yeah, well,
I have cheat notes in my bra.

20:30.320 --> 20:33.280
[all laugh]

20:33.280 --> 20:36.720
And what did the blokes in town think
of your new plan for Deadloch, then?

20:36.720 --> 20:39.400
Yeah, well, I mean,
the first year of the Feastival,

20:39.400 --> 20:41.080
some local men had a tantrum

20:41.080 --> 20:45.880
and decided to dump a pile of roadkill
in front of Town Hall in protest.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.760
Mercifully, the patrons just thought
the whole thing was art.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.080
Even the smell.

20:50.080 --> 20:54.240
And were Trent and Gavin Latham
a part of that protest?

20:55.240 --> 20:57.200
They were.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.000
God rest their ridiculous souls.

21:01.080 --> 21:05.960
All of those men had a...
better relationship with Rod.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.800
- Really?
- Mmm.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.800
- Men gravitated to Rod.
- Mm-hm.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.880
They admired him.
They respected him.

21:16.080 --> 21:19.080
I've never seen an equal to my Rod.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.440
Oh, Margaret, do you need some...

21:21.440 --> 21:23.760
- I might have a tissue somewhere
- God. No, I...

21:23.760 --> 21:24.920
[Dulcie speaks indistinctly]

21:24.920 --> 21:27.480
I know it's been five years,
but I just... I...

21:27.480 --> 21:28.760
[Dulcie] Of course.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.560
- [Margaret] Still love him.
- [Dulcie] Yeah, Of course.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.080
Always will.

21:32.080 --> 21:35.240
If you loved him so much, why is he
buried in the local cemetery, then?

21:36.240 --> 21:37.560
Sorry?

21:37.560 --> 21:41.080
Well, according to this
big, fucking weighty fuck-off book,

21:41.080 --> 21:45.760
four generations of Carruthers
are buried at this here private island.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.400
So why is your Rod
buried in the local cemetery?

21:49.400 --> 21:50.400
[bang]

21:51.400 --> 21:54.120
It's tiger snake cocktail hour
all year round out there

21:54.120 --> 21:56.320
and I don't my Rod would want me
mainlining antivenom

21:56.320 --> 21:57.920
every time I visited.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.320
[Aleyna] Margaret!

22:00.320 --> 22:03.360
Bloody Phil is on the warpath
about this Latham memorial.

22:03.360 --> 22:06.440
Well, thank fuck.
Are you here to see me?

22:09.240 --> 22:10.960
You know what Mikey told me?

22:10.960 --> 22:12.520
Your marriage celebrant, Robin,

22:12.520 --> 22:15.040
only marries couples
she reckons will last.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.360
- Cool.
- [giggles]

22:16.360 --> 22:18.520
You're so lucky to have
found someone, Abs.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.760
You know 90% of the men that
I've slept with are married?

22:20.760 --> 22:22.520
Seriously. I did a spreadsheet.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.520
90%, Abby! [chuckles]

22:24.520 --> 22:26.440
- What is wrong with me?
- I don't know. Hey, Michelle...

22:26.440 --> 22:29.440
Oh, my goodness,
did you hear about Sam O'Dwyer?

22:29.440 --> 22:31.680
- He was such a nice guy.
- Mm-hm.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.240
I'd hate to drown.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.480
Not as much as I'd hate to be on fire.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.920
Hey, Michelle, what's that
certificate on your wall?

22:37.920 --> 22:40.280
Oh, that's my Carruthers
Women in Business certificate.

22:40.280 --> 22:41.760
That's how I opened my salon.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.440
Margaret has given so many women
a leg-up with that grant.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.440
I mean, there's Trish
at the bell tents,

22:46.440 --> 22:47.960
Tania from the fromagerie, me.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.600
It just goes to show that
you can have all the money in the world

22:50.600 --> 22:54.160
and still have absolutely
shocking taste in men. [laughs]

22:54.160 --> 22:57.000
Because Rod Dixon was awful,
wasn't he?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.440
He was?

22:58.440 --> 23:00.280
He was, wasn't he?

23:00.280 --> 23:02.320
Total bully misogynist.

23:03.480 --> 23:06.480
What do you think, hon?
Are we getting close?

23:07.480 --> 23:09.200
I think so, Michelle.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.400
Do you reckon I could try on
a few pairs of lashes?

23:11.400 --> 23:13.280
[gasps] Yes!

23:13.280 --> 23:14.560
But it could take a while, though.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.520
That's OK. I'm happy to chat.

23:16.520 --> 23:20.000
Ooh! [giggles]

23:20.000 --> 23:21.760
What about these ones? [indistinct]

23:21.760 --> 23:23.880
Too much. Too much, Michelle. Too much.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.880
What do you mean
you can't tell me anything?

23:25.880 --> 23:28.720
Aleyna, it is not procedure
to comment on an active case.

23:28.720 --> 23:32.120
Well, your procedure is
making me shit blood, Dulcie.

23:32.120 --> 23:35.040
It's making people think that
I don't care about the Latham murders,

23:35.040 --> 23:36.800
which I actually do, a bit.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.360
And Phil is using that. You watch.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.600
He's going to announce that
he's running for mayor soon.

23:41.600 --> 23:44.120
That man is creeping up on me
like a disembodied scrotum.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.560
Aleyna, did Margaret help you
with your mayoral campaign?

23:46.560 --> 23:48.680
What? Yes. Why?

23:48.680 --> 23:51.280
So you weren't a part of
Rod's succession plan?

23:51.280 --> 23:54.800
Fuck no! Phil was part of
Rod's succession plan.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.600
If Rod hadn't died and Margaret
hadn't put her money behind me

23:57.600 --> 24:00.560
this little brown girl wouldn't have
stood a chance in Deadloch.

24:00.560 --> 24:03.680
But here I am, the first female mayor.

24:03.680 --> 24:06.200
And this town is only getting better.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.560
- It is a total paradise.
- [ding]

24:09.800 --> 24:13.600
Fuck! Phil's just released
a statement condemning the murders.

24:13.600 --> 24:16.560
He says "They're bad."
Well, of course they're bad, Phil.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.960
They're murders, Phil!
Fuck me dead!

24:18.960 --> 24:22.520
Um, Aleyna, can I get a list of anyone
you've prescribed pentobarbital to

24:22.520 --> 24:23.800
- in the last five years?
- [ding]

24:23.800 --> 24:25.000
Ugh, we've got that interview.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.760
That little turtleneck fucker Megan
is already three minutes late.

24:27.760 --> 24:30.040
OK, Aleyna, pentobarbital, please.

24:30.040 --> 24:31.200
Oh, fine, Dulce.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.840
But if you want it to help you sleep,

24:32.840 --> 24:34.480
you'd be better off
getting gummies off Joan.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.240
- I don't want it, Aleyna.
- Margaret!

24:36.240 --> 24:39.240
That Food, Wine and Crime writer
is running late again,

24:39.240 --> 24:41.480
so don't give her a free cookbook.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.800
She can pay 89.95 like everyone else.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.800
[Margaret] OK, darling.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.320
Jesus!

24:47.320 --> 24:49.360
A baby could walk out of
that woman's surgery

24:49.360 --> 24:50.800
with a sippy cup of morphine

24:50.800 --> 24:53.240
and that doctor mayor
would not know.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.520
The killer's using pentobarbital,
isn't he?

24:56.520 --> 24:58.320
Ah, that's
confidential information, Aleyna.

24:58.320 --> 25:02.040
Oh, my God. I cannot believe you're
not talking to me about this, Dulcie!

25:02.040 --> 25:03.320
You're dead to me.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.360
And happy birthday for tomorrow,
by the way.

25:09.120 --> 25:11.840
[Eddie] Your doctor mayor mate
knows too fucking much.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.320
Aleyna's a professional.
She won't blab, trust me.

25:14.320 --> 25:17.840
Yeah, well just don't spill too much
when we talk with your wife.

25:17.840 --> 25:18.840
Fine.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.440
[Eddie] What's wrong with that sheep?

25:29.440 --> 25:31.040
It's a goat.

25:32.200 --> 25:35.560
Uh, hey, Cath, can we ask you
a few questions about pentobarbital?

25:35.560 --> 25:36.960
Why?

25:36.960 --> 25:38.840
It's relevant to the case, love.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.800
OK, sexy. What do you need to know?

25:41.800 --> 25:44.920
Well, have you prescribed pentobarbital
to any of your clients?

25:44.920 --> 25:48.280
Well, I don't normally prescribe it.
I usually administer it myself.

25:48.280 --> 25:49.600
- Ah-huh.
- Mmm.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.760
But you have doled it out before, then?

25:51.760 --> 25:55.960
Sorry, excuse me, I don't just dole out
potentially lethal sedatives, Detective.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.960
My supply's under lock and key.
I keep fastidious records.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.560
- They're watertight. Ask Dulce.
- Mm-hm.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.280
You could use them as a dental dam.

26:04.680 --> 26:07.960
Point is, I actually take my job
seriously, Detective Redcliffe.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.320
Oh, good-o. So, ah...

26:09.320 --> 26:11.960
So the Lathams get stuck with a needle?

26:11.960 --> 26:16.480
That bit is confidential
case information, so I...

26:16.480 --> 26:17.880
[Eddie] Fucking hell!

26:17.880 --> 26:21.360
I'm sorry, love. Will you just
excuse us for one second?

26:21.360 --> 26:24.440
[whispers] Hey, I just think that
I'm better off doing this on my own.

26:24.440 --> 26:26.240
Yeah, yeah. I agree. Get it done.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.400
- Just get the fucking list.
- Yeah.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.160
Oh, gosh, it's getting cold.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.720
[clears throat]

26:36.280 --> 26:38.600
Oh. Um...

26:39.720 --> 26:43.320
So, I was talking to Margaret earlier,

26:43.320 --> 26:46.640
about that hobby farm
still being on the market.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.720
And I was just thinking that
maybe we could...

26:49.720 --> 26:51.400
have a little think about

26:51.400 --> 26:54.720
talking about
thinking of putting in an offer.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.720
Really?

26:57.720 --> 26:59.640
- Really?
- Well...

26:59.640 --> 27:03.560
I was literally just thinking
we could grow opium poppies there!

27:03.560 --> 27:05.040
How illegal is that, though?

27:05.040 --> 27:06.240
Oh, it's pretty illegal.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.760
[laughs]

27:07.760 --> 27:09.840
- I love you!
- Oh, OK...

27:09.840 --> 27:13.120
- Oh, it's dripping on my back!
- [laughs]

27:13.120 --> 27:15.800
OK. Mm-hm Yeah.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.400
[laughs]

27:17.400 --> 27:19.360
Um, OK. Alright, great.

27:19.360 --> 27:23.680
Well, ah, could I get a list of
your pentobarbital records?

27:23.680 --> 27:25.160
Yeah, yeah, sure.

27:25.160 --> 27:27.960
I've just got to finish inseminating
Felicia. I'll email them to you.

27:27.960 --> 27:29.600
Of course.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.360
Alright, OK, I've got to go.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.440
- OK. I love you.
- I love you.

27:33.440 --> 27:37.400
Oh, hey, love, um, have you
ever prescribed pentobarbital

27:37.400 --> 27:40.160
to any of the farm staff
at the Carruthers Estate?

27:40.160 --> 27:42.440
- Nuh.
- OK.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.640
Oh, just Margaret.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.840
I just gave it straight to her
'cause she's an ex-nurse.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.440
She knows exactly what she's doing.

27:53.520 --> 27:56.240
[Eddie] I don't care if Margaret says
she uses it on her horses.

27:56.240 --> 27:59.440
She also used it on her husband,
who is not a horse.

27:59.440 --> 28:00.640
We don't know that.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.040
Yeah, I'm pretty fucking sure
we do know.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.080
I've seen photos. He doesn't look
much like a horse to me.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.680
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Collins, Collins.

28:05.680 --> 28:07.160
- Look at the facts.
- Don't be a smarty pants.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.880
Marg is a nurse, who,
thanks to your missus

28:08.880 --> 28:11.520
has enough penis-orbital...

28:11.520 --> 28:13.800
- [mutters] Pentobarbital.
- ...to fucking
put down a football team.

28:13.800 --> 28:18.000
And she is turning this town
into a man-free leztopia.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.880
In conclusion,

28:19.880 --> 28:22.640
Mrs Chutney Fucker is a psycho.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.120
- OK, well, that...
- Ma'ams?

28:24.120 --> 28:26.000
[Eddie] Big Eye... Oh.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.920
Jesus Christ. What happened to you?

28:27.920 --> 28:30.360
Michelle gave me lashes
and then I rubbed them.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.560
Why? Does it look bad?

28:32.560 --> 28:34.040
- Yes.
- Yeah.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.280
So, Michelle talked at me for hours.

28:36.280 --> 28:39.040
- I have so much goss...
- Shh, shh, shh!

28:39.040 --> 28:42.400
Lydia, Claudia, Lydia.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.200
[indistinct police radio chatter]

28:45.360 --> 28:46.920
Yeah.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.560
OK, apparently Margaret and Rod
were estranged.

28:49.560 --> 28:52.040
She spent, like,
six months a year overseas,

28:52.040 --> 28:53.880
trying to get away from him.

28:53.880 --> 28:57.320
Top line is,
Margaret hated her husband's guts.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.480
Oh, did she?

28:59.480 --> 29:02.560
Also, Michelle said that
Rod was a total misogynist bully

29:02.560 --> 29:03.760
to the council women.

29:03.760 --> 29:05.680
He even sniffed Aleyna's chair once.

29:05.680 --> 29:08.320
OK, well, that is abhorrent but...

29:08.320 --> 29:10.040
- Mate, mate, mate, mate.
- It's still not enough.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.040
Mate!

29:11.040 --> 29:14.400
You said that ladies kill
the person closest to them,

29:14.400 --> 29:17.360
and then that first murder
informs the rest.

29:17.360 --> 29:20.640
So I think she has bumped off
her husband.

29:20.640 --> 29:21.920
She's got a taste of freedom.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.360
Now she's passing on the benefits
to the other women in town.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.840
I'm just... I'm struggling to
see her as a murderer.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.160
- Sexy, you're too close.
- That is really inappropriate.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.360
- Open your eyes.
- Can you not ever do that again?

29:31.360 --> 29:34.920
Mate, she has the drugs.
Her husband was the first victim.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.480
What if I'm right
and she kills again, hey?

29:38.880 --> 29:40.520
OK, alright.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.280
- Alright, we go.
- OK. Come on, Big Eyes, let's go.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.720
- Yes, ma'am.
- I know where we can find her.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.720
- Ahh
- Oh!

29:46.720 --> 29:49.440
Constable, that eye
looks like a haemorrhoid.

29:49.440 --> 29:50.800
- Mm-hm?
- Go and sort it out.

29:50.800 --> 29:51.960
OK.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.400
[indistinct shouting]

30:02.960 --> 30:05.080
[shouting continues]

30:07.560 --> 30:09.960
Oi! Move your hooves. Come on!

30:09.960 --> 30:12.320
Clippety-clop! Clippety-clop!
Hurry up!

30:12.320 --> 30:13.760
[shouting continues]

30:15.680 --> 30:19.520
So, years ago,
I was out at Carruthers Island.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.480
It's our private island.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.400
It's a beautiful spot,
just off the coast.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.680
- And I spot this little sea sprite...
- [Eddie whispers] Get in there.

30:25.680 --> 30:29.040
- [Dulcie whispers] Don't push!
- ...emerging from the water
in diving gear.

30:29.040 --> 30:31.520
- This girl, she's all of 13, 14.
- [Eddie whispers] Mate, come on!

30:31.520 --> 30:33.200
- Let's go get her.
- I assumed she was meeting a boy.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.200
Just wait!

30:34.200 --> 30:35.680
But when I asked her
what she was doing,

30:35.680 --> 30:38.360
she replied in this flat little accent,

30:38.360 --> 30:40.240
"Diving for abalone."

30:40.240 --> 30:42.560
And then I said, "Well, darling,

30:42.560 --> 30:45.400
"if you're stealing abalone
from my island,

30:45.400 --> 30:48.320
"the least you can do
is cook it up for me."

30:48.320 --> 30:49.440
[laughter]

30:49.440 --> 30:51.160
And that was the first meal that

30:51.160 --> 30:55.320
Feastival Culinary Director Skye O'Dwyer
ever cooked for me.

30:55.320 --> 30:58.160
- And now you can make it too, mm?
- [applause]

30:59.600 --> 31:00.760
Alright, let's fucking go!

31:00.760 --> 31:04.360
[man] Margaret, beautiful stories
accompany your recipes.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.400
One in particular resonated with me,

31:06.400 --> 31:09.960
the story behind
your limoncello drizzle cake.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.240
And it was on tour in Italy,

31:12.240 --> 31:14.440
whilst you were eating
a slice of this cake,

31:14.440 --> 31:19.160
as you were "overlooking
the azure waters of the Ligurian Sea"

31:19.160 --> 31:23.000
that you received word that
your husband, Rod, had died.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.040
That's right. I was in Riomaggiore.

31:27.040 --> 31:30.040
Beautiful place. Terrible situation.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.280
Sorry.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.200
You were fucking where
when your husband died?

31:35.200 --> 31:38.960
In Riomaggiore. In Italy.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.360
Tom's not answering his phone, eh.

31:42.360 --> 31:45.360
His grandpa just died five years ago,
so I want to do something nice for him.

31:45.360 --> 31:48.440
You know, teach him how to kick,
or he can watch me kick.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.360
- Oh, yeah, that'll cheer him up.
- I know.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.000
Speaking of me, Adele,

31:52.000 --> 31:53.840
because Miranda's abandoning us,

31:53.840 --> 31:56.320
the Pademelons footy team
is just us two now.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.880
So, let's talking titles.

31:57.880 --> 32:00.640
First things first, which one of us
is going to be captain?

32:02.480 --> 32:04.360
You should be captain.

32:04.360 --> 32:07.320
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Good instinct, Adele.

32:07.320 --> 32:11.160
Cunt! How the fuck is that woman
not a fucking psychopath?

32:22.040 --> 32:23.920
- [rustling]
- Look, I don't know what to say.

32:23.920 --> 32:26.200
Margaret wasn't in the country
when her husband died.

32:26.200 --> 32:29.120
Yeah, well she probably outsourced it
like she did everything else.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.920
So what do we fucking do now?

32:30.920 --> 32:32.200
[zip pulls]

32:33.200 --> 32:36.800
Oh! Dulcie, hon,
I am so sorry to bother you

32:36.800 --> 32:39.760
but I've got to
get something off my chest.

32:39.760 --> 32:41.760
It's about Sam O'Dwyer.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.360
So I was lying in my floatation tank.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.800
I swear by it,
it's like being back in the womb.

32:47.800 --> 32:51.040
I was lying there so relaxed,
when, bang, it hit me,

32:51.040 --> 32:52.760
and I realised, I have got to
tell Dulcie this

32:52.760 --> 32:55.240
otherwise I am not going to
sleep a wink tonight.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.320
Uh, Michelle, we're in the middle of
a murder investigation

32:57.320 --> 32:58.480
at the moment so...

32:58.480 --> 33:00.200
Oh, absolutely, hon.

33:00.200 --> 33:02.720
The thing is, Abby came in today
to get her makeup redone,

33:02.720 --> 33:05.600
and we got to talking about Sam O'Dwyer.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.360
Did you ever meet Sam, Dulce,
or was he before your time?

33:08.360 --> 33:09.440
Ah...

33:09.440 --> 33:12.920
Anyway, I remembered how
I'd hired the footy club from Sam

33:12.920 --> 33:15.600
for my brother Leo's 40th
Gangsters and Molls party.

33:15.600 --> 33:16.840
Here's the thing.

33:16.840 --> 33:20.280
I'd arranged to meet him at the club
on the day to decorate,

33:20.280 --> 33:22.320
'cause I knew him quite well,

33:22.320 --> 33:24.000
but he never showed up.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.760
- Leo?
- No, Sam!

33:26.760 --> 33:30.400
So here I was, stuck outside
with two hundred helium balloons

33:30.400 --> 33:33.840
and six bags of plastic
cigarette holders from Shiploads,

33:33.840 --> 33:35.840
because it was a really big do.

33:35.840 --> 33:38.200
I'd hired a flapper dress
and everything.

33:38.200 --> 33:42.200
In the end, I ended up having to
get Mike to relocate the party

33:42.200 --> 33:43.960
to Geoff Haddick's wool shed.

33:43.960 --> 33:47.200
Oh, are you and Cath still maybe
making an offer on that, Dulce?

33:47.200 --> 33:49.720
Ah, yeah, we're thinking about
talking about putting in an offer.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.720
Great!

33:50.720 --> 33:52.960
- OK, thanks for that, Rochelle.
- Michelle.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.880
So over the next few days I kept
calling Sam to get the deposit back,

33:55.880 --> 33:59.600
because $75 is $75.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.000
But I couldn't get a hold of him.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.960
So after a week I thought, "Stuff it.

34:02.960 --> 34:06.000
"I will get that miserable man,
Rod Dixon, to refund the deposit,"

34:06.000 --> 34:08.719
because he was
president of the footy club at the time,

34:08.719 --> 34:10.639
but he'd only refund me half.

34:10.639 --> 34:11.639
What?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.360
What date was Leo's party, Michelle?

34:15.360 --> 34:17.639
13th of June, 2017.

34:20.080 --> 34:25.080
Anyway, all this talk about Sam
made me realise in the flotation tank,

34:25.080 --> 34:30.159
oh, my God, I didn't return
the flapper dress to the costume store.

34:30.159 --> 34:32.040
I stole it!

34:32.040 --> 34:34.159
So that's why I've turned myself in.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.440
- Oh...
- Do you need to cuff me?

34:38.679 --> 34:42.679
[Eddie] Sam disappeared
before Rod Dixon was killed.

34:42.679 --> 34:45.440
- He was our first victim.
- [Dulcie] He was.

34:46.639 --> 34:48.120
We fucked the timeline.

34:49.159 --> 34:51.920
It explains why she
stored his body so carefully.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.159
He was special to her.

34:54.320 --> 34:55.800
Also explains the head wound

34:55.800 --> 34:58.560
and why there was no pentobarbital
in his system.

34:58.560 --> 35:01.080
His death wasn't planned.
It was emotional.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.400
He wasn't part of her MO.
He created it.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.480
So we have to start again?

35:12.040 --> 35:13.080
We do.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.280
Fuck!

35:27.440 --> 35:29.320
Who ordered the pud?

35:29.320 --> 35:30.840
Mmm.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.480
Cheers, hey!

35:34.640 --> 35:38.080
- Are you Ted with the excavator?
- Why?

35:39.200 --> 35:41.320
You trying to dig something up?

35:41.320 --> 35:42.760
You could say that.

35:51.160 --> 35:54.640
Good morning, you're listening to
Pink Flag Radio. This is Hamish.

35:54.640 --> 35:57.200
I'm joined now by Mayor Aleyna Rahme.

35:57.200 --> 36:00.480
Mayor Rahme, do you have any updates
on the Deadloch murders?

36:00.480 --> 36:04.360
[Aleyna] Well, I'm here to do
the Feastival Daily Diary, Hamish.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.040
[Hamish] But you're very close
to Senior Sergeant Collins.

36:07.040 --> 36:10.160
Has she given you any indication
of who they think is doing this?

36:10.160 --> 36:12.560
[Aleyna] Um...
Well, what I can tell you is...

36:12.560 --> 36:14.640
Actually, no, um...

36:14.640 --> 36:19.160
Tomorrow we are having
a dog parade, Hamish. That'll be nice.

36:19.160 --> 36:22.160
- Collins!
- Good morning, Redcliff.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.280
- No. That didn't feel...
- No, I don't...

36:24.280 --> 36:25.280
- Yeah.
- OK.

36:25.280 --> 36:29.520
Um, so, had a little poke
around the shack again last night.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.440
Only thing I discovered was that

36:31.440 --> 36:34.160
Sam O'Dwyer has
a lot of Shane Warne books.

36:34.160 --> 36:35.760
Do with that what you will.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.640
[Sven] Here she is!

36:37.640 --> 36:40.440
Haaa...

36:40.440 --> 36:42.640
...ow good is that outfit, Eddie?

36:42.640 --> 36:44.640
Th... That's really good.
That's, um... What colour is that?

36:44.640 --> 36:47.080
Hot orange,
so I don't get shot by poachers.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.880
- Oh, fun!
- OK, so turns out we were wrong.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.640
Sam O'Dwyer is our first victim.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.440
- Oh, bummer.
- Yeah, it is.

36:54.440 --> 36:56.200
- Thanks, Sven, it is a bummer.
- Bummer.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.320
So, victim profile.

36:57.320 --> 37:00.440
Sam O'Dwyer was
a former football coach and publican.

37:00.440 --> 37:03.040
- [ding]
- And...

37:03.040 --> 37:05.880
unlike the other victims,

37:05.880 --> 37:09.320
who've proven to be
a veritable urine trough

37:09.320 --> 37:13.480
of violent, abusive, misogynist bullies

37:13.480 --> 37:16.800
Sam's family, friends
and everyone in town

37:16.800 --> 37:20.920
- describe him as
kind, generous, caring.
- [ding]

37:20.920 --> 37:24.440
And that... Which makes the, er, the...

37:24.440 --> 37:31.080
killer's motivation for...
for, um, killing Sam less clear.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.040
Well, he's still a man,

37:33.040 --> 37:35.360
so there's got to be
something wrong with him.

37:35.360 --> 37:36.640
So binary.

37:36.640 --> 37:37.640
What?

37:37.640 --> 37:40.520
Gender's made up, is all. It's made up.
It's like the stock market.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.560
Ugh... Alright, alright.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.160
Let's talk suspects.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.120
Who are the women in Sam's sphere?

37:46.120 --> 37:48.680
What about Vic O'Dwyer?
She's ripped.

37:48.680 --> 37:50.640
Ah, well, what about her hips?

37:50.640 --> 37:52.920
Well, I don't know if she's got
cum gutters. We're not that close.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.520
- Ugh...
- OK, sorry, who are you talking about?

37:54.520 --> 37:57.200
Victoria O'Dwyer,
Sam O'Dwyer's daughter.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.760
That's Skye O'Dwyer!

37:58.760 --> 38:00.680
She wasn't even in Deadloch
when Sam died.

38:00.680 --> 38:04.000
Victoria is Sam's 70-year-old wife
with a steel hip.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.040
Who else are you mixing up, Detective?

38:06.040 --> 38:08.120
Hey, fair cop, mate!
It's a lot of names!

38:08.120 --> 38:09.680
Alright, let's park Viv
for the moment...

38:09.680 --> 38:12.360
- Vic! Vic!
- Vic, Vic, Vic.

38:12.360 --> 38:14.080
What about, um, other women?

38:14.080 --> 38:17.080
Any more of this lot up here
connected to Sam?

38:17.080 --> 38:19.280
Not closely, no. I've already checked.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.160
We're going to have to
cast the net a little wider.

38:21.160 --> 38:22.640
Sven, what have you got?

38:22.640 --> 38:25.680
Honestly, just, like, so much admiration
for both of you.

38:25.680 --> 38:27.360
Like, you're both so incredible.

38:27.360 --> 38:30.160
You're persevering with this case
even though it's not going very well.

38:30.160 --> 38:32.160
So good.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.600
[stammers]
I meant women with criminal records.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.480
[laughs] Oh, sorry. Brain fart.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.160
These are all local women
with criminal records.

38:41.160 --> 38:43.320
None of them have priors
for multiple murders, though,

38:43.320 --> 38:44.400
I'm afraid.

38:44.400 --> 38:49.680
The only one with a violent charge
was this lady, Wendy Taylor,

38:49.680 --> 38:53.480
former Carruthers Estate cleaner
charged with assault.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.160
Who'd she whack?

38:55.160 --> 38:57.840
Where's Wendy's file?

38:57.840 --> 39:00.120
Wendy Taylor assaulted Sam O'Dwyer.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.160
Oh! That's the guy.

39:03.160 --> 39:05.960
Alright! Let's bring her in, then!

39:05.960 --> 39:07.080
Hmm...

39:07.080 --> 39:09.480
- That's going to be hard.
- What?

39:09.480 --> 39:10.840
Wendy's in jail.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.920
But I do know who we can talk to.

39:15.560 --> 39:18.600
Why did your mum assault
Sam O'Dwyer, Sharelle?

39:19.680 --> 39:21.160
I don't recall.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.040
Well, did she know Sam very well?

39:23.040 --> 39:25.080
I know she also used to be the cleaner

39:25.080 --> 39:27.760
at the footy club and the pub,
didn't she?

39:27.760 --> 39:29.280
I don't recall that, either.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.800
She knocked his teeth out,

39:30.800 --> 39:33.040
so he must have done something
to piss her off.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.680
I don't recall.

39:34.680 --> 39:36.800
OK, well, is there anybody else
you can think of

39:36.800 --> 39:38.680
that might have had a problem with him?

39:38.680 --> 39:41.440
Cannot think of a single person.

39:41.440 --> 39:43.160
Think you're lying to us, Sharelle.

39:43.160 --> 39:44.640
I think I'm not.

39:46.640 --> 39:49.080

50:48.000 --> 50:49.560
You have no respect.

50:51.440 --> 50:52.760
Go get a park. Fuck!

50:53.800 --> 50:55.040
Yeah.

50:56.080 --> 50:58.200
Hey, um, I'll get out here too, Ray.

50:58.200 --> 50:59.960
- Yes. OK.
- Thanks.

51:02.440 --> 51:04.200
[Aleyna] Tonight, it is my honour

51:04.200 --> 51:07.400
to announce that the public outdoor gym

51:07.400 --> 51:11.840
will be renamed the Trent Latham
Memorial Outdoor Gym

51:11.840 --> 51:14.200
and the toilet block next to it

51:14.200 --> 51:17.920
will be named
the Gavin Latham Memorial Toilets.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.520
Mayor, um, do you have any actual
updates on the Latham murders?

51:24.520 --> 51:28.000
Well, that's a confidential police
investigation, Jeremy, so...

51:28.000 --> 51:29.360
So the police aren't talking to you.

51:29.360 --> 51:31.000
Do they not have faith
in you either, Mayor?

51:31.000 --> 51:34.200
No, Megan, we are in
the constant contact with the police.

51:34.200 --> 51:36.280
So, what can you tell us
about the case then, Mayor?

51:36.280 --> 51:38.960
What have police told you?
What do you know?

51:38.960 --> 51:41.120
Well, something that I do now
is that the police believe that...

51:41.120 --> 51:42.800
[Eddie] Hi everyone! Sorry I'm late.

51:42.800 --> 51:45.080
Thanks for that, Doctor Mayor.
You can shut the fuck up now.

51:45.080 --> 51:46.640
Right, um... Yeah.

51:46.640 --> 51:49.320
So now just a little update on the case,

51:49.320 --> 51:53.840
and that update is there is no update
at this time, alright?

51:53.840 --> 51:55.600
[journalists] Detective! Detective!

51:55.600 --> 51:59.160
Jimmy, I'm gonna slice your dick up
like a roast, true God, I will!

51:59.160 --> 52:01.280
I need to tell Vanessa something
about something!

52:01.280 --> 52:03.040
No, you fucking don't!
She's grieving!

52:03.040 --> 52:04.400
- Leave her alone!
- Hey, calm down!

52:04.400 --> 52:06.840
Calm down, alright? Hey, Jimmy,
come on. Come for a walk, alright?

52:06.840 --> 52:08.440
I don't like walking, Mike!

52:08.440 --> 52:10.680
- Fuck off, ya little prick!
- Moll bitch!

52:10.680 --> 52:12.280
Sharelle!

52:12.280 --> 52:13.840
Oh, what do you want?

52:13.840 --> 52:16.280
I need to talk to you about Sam O'Dwyer.

52:16.280 --> 52:18.840
Detective, do you have
any info on the killer?

52:18.840 --> 52:22.040
I just said, I can't fucking
tell you anything, so...

52:22.040 --> 52:24.640
I can't say anything about...

52:24.640 --> 52:26.800
them at this time.

52:26.800 --> 52:28.800
Is this because
you don't know anything about him?

52:28.800 --> 52:32.240
No, because it wouldn't be
in the interests of the investigation

52:32.240 --> 52:34.800
to reveal anything about... them.

52:34.800 --> 52:37.280
Why do you keep saying "them"?
Is there more than one killer?

52:37.280 --> 52:41.760
No, I keep saying "them"
because gender is made up.

52:41.760 --> 52:43.040
Isn't that right, Sven?

52:43.040 --> 52:44.640
Yep. Yes. Yep.

52:44.640 --> 52:47.040
It's rooted in
white supremacy and colonialism

52:47.040 --> 52:50.760
- and it's actually a spectrum,
like a rainbow.
- [phone buzzes]

52:50.760 --> 52:53.720
And everyone deserves to be liberated
from the gender binary.

52:53.720 --> 52:58.400
Detective, four days ago Ted
from Ted's Excavation and Septic Tanks

52:58.400 --> 53:00.080
exhumed a body from Deadloch Cemetery.

53:00.080 --> 53:02.440
Was that at the request
of Deadloch Police?

53:03.600 --> 53:06.160
Right, so it's not
Vic O'Dwyer's pubic hair?

53:06.160 --> 53:08.280
- [Abby] Sharelle!
- [Kate] No, it's not
matching her sample.

53:08.280 --> 53:09.720
Sorry, Detective.

53:09.720 --> 53:11.720
- OK. Thanks, Kate.
- [Abby] Just hear me out.

53:13.080 --> 53:14.320
[Sharelle] Fuck, Abby!

53:14.320 --> 53:16.320
Can you confirm or deny that
the exhumed body

53:16.320 --> 53:18.440
was that of former mayor, Rod Dixon?

53:18.440 --> 53:19.800
Ah...

53:19.800 --> 53:21.280
[stammers]

53:21.280 --> 53:23.760
[Megan] Mayor Dixon's body was found
five years ago on Deadloch Beach,

53:23.760 --> 53:27.160
- exactly the same location as
recent victims Trent and Gavin Latham.
- [whispers] Get me a beer!

53:27.160 --> 53:28.600
Is that correct?

53:28.600 --> 53:32.280
Ah, I will not be taking
any questions at this time.

53:32.280 --> 53:34.880
Fuck, Abby! You know why Mum decked him.

53:34.880 --> 53:36.320
You remember what he was like!

53:36.320 --> 53:38.760
Sharelle, I know Sam cracked onto you.

53:38.760 --> 53:41.120
I just need to know
who else he tried it with.

53:41.120 --> 53:43.880
I'm never telling you
anything ever again, Abby.

53:43.880 --> 53:45.440
You're a cop now.

53:45.440 --> 53:47.840
[Megan] The body of beloved local,
Sam O'Dwyer,

53:47.840 --> 53:49.840
was recently recovered
from Deadloch Lake.

53:49.840 --> 53:54.240
According to forensic pathologist
James King's recent TEDx Perth talk,

53:54.240 --> 53:57.120
Sam likely died
only days before Rod Dixon died.

53:57.120 --> 54:01.120
King also said O'Dwyer's death is
being treated by police as suspicious.

54:01.120 --> 54:03.080
Suspicious means a murder, doesn't it?

54:03.080 --> 54:04.400
Ah...

54:04.400 --> 54:08.600
Um, I will not be, uh...
taking questions at this time.

54:08.600 --> 54:10.880
Are the murder of Trent Latham,
Gavin Latham,

54:10.880 --> 54:13.560
Rod Dixon and Sam O'Dwyer
connected?

54:14.920 --> 54:18.280
Detective, a serial killer is defined as
someone who commits four murders

54:18.280 --> 54:19.760
in a period of over a month

54:19.760 --> 54:22.440
with cooling down time
between those murders.

54:22.440 --> 54:25.360
Are these Deadloch murders
the work of a serial killer?

54:25.360 --> 54:27.120
- Ah...
- [crowd exclaims]

54:29.040 --> 54:30.480
Sharelle...

54:30.480 --> 54:32.440
I can't sit on this information.

54:32.440 --> 54:33.800
The police think that Sam O'Dwyer

54:33.800 --> 54:36.200
was with someone else
the night he went missing.

54:36.200 --> 54:38.160
So if you know who that was,
you have to tell us.

54:38.160 --> 54:40.320
Mate, Sam O'Dwyer's dick
was like a ferret

54:40.320 --> 54:42.280
constantly searching for any hole.

54:42.280 --> 54:44.360
It could have been any number
of women that night.

54:46.040 --> 54:47.600
[Dulcie] What did you just say?
