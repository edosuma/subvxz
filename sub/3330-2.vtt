00:04.771 --> 00:06.505
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:10.776
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.778 --> 00:12.644
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.646 --> 00:15.247
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.249 --> 00:17.783
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.785 --> 00:20.152
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.154 --> 00:21.520
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:23.122
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:23.124 --> 00:24.690
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:24.692 --> 00:26.558
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.094
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:29.096 --> 00:31.263
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.265 --> 00:32.264
<i>And paige?</i>

00:32.266 --> 00:33.432
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.434 --> 00:34.533
<i>She's normal</i>

00:34.535 --> 00:35.801
And translates the world for us

00:35.803 --> 00:37.236
<i>While we help her understand</i>

00:37.238 --> 00:38.504
<i>Her genius son.</i>

00:38.506 --> 00:40.439
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:41.808 --> 00:44.276
Man:
<i>Of the six</i>

00:44.278 --> 00:45.577
Three-digit integers

00:45.579 --> 00:47.179
On the board,

00:47.181 --> 00:49.148
Which are divisible by four?

00:49.150 --> 00:50.682
O'brien!
All of them.

00:50.684 --> 00:54.386
Not even in the outer
reaches of pluto,

00:54.388 --> 00:56.822
Where you
generally reside,

00:56.824 --> 00:59.391
Is 703 divisible by four.

00:59.393 --> 01:04.296
703 divided by four is 175.75.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.532
They can all be
divided by four,

01:06.534 --> 01:08.233
Just with the remainders.

01:09.369 --> 01:11.170
You didn't define your terms.

01:12.539 --> 01:14.540
(school bell ringing)

01:14.542 --> 01:16.375
(indistinct chatter)

01:16.377 --> 01:17.376
O'brien!

01:17.378 --> 01:19.445
Stay.

01:25.452 --> 01:28.253
You show a growing
disdain for authority.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.788
It's concerning.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.557
Hands on the desk.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.461
Hands on the desk.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.365
(fire alarm ringing)

01:40.367 --> 01:42.101
There's no drill scheduled.

01:42.103 --> 01:43.535
Move out,
o'brien.

01:51.211 --> 01:52.711
Walter.
Let's go.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.650
You could get arrested for
pulling the fire alarm.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.385
He should get arrested
for daring to strike you.

02:00.387 --> 02:01.620
He'll just call dad.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.222
I'll take care
of that, too.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.257
Megan, someday
I'll pay you back.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.425
I'll take a
lamborghini,

02:06.427 --> 02:07.893
Bright yellow.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.161
Race ya!

02:26.779 --> 02:29.248
(door closes)

02:29.250 --> 02:30.249
Paige:
Sorry I'm late.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.850
Uh, ralph's sick again.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.752
That's two days in
a row, huh, pal?

02:33.754 --> 02:35.254
Yeah, his fever won't break.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.655
I'm gonna take him
to the doctor at 10:00

02:36.657 --> 02:37.756
And then my neighbor
can watch him.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.359
If that's okay?
Mm-hmm.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.894
Are you okay?
You don't look so...

02:41.896 --> 02:43.195
Never been healthier.

02:44.397 --> 02:46.231
So... Mail arrived.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.700
Menus and...
Paychecks.

02:50.370 --> 02:51.537
Mo' money.
Mo' problems.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.905
Or so I've heard
in the rapper song.

02:52.907 --> 02:55.541
Well, rappers may have
99 or so problems

02:55.543 --> 02:57.843
But misplacing paychecks
is not one of them.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.678
Lax cleared
our debt.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.913
This is our first fresh cash.

03:00.915 --> 03:03.415
Toby, are you gonna
be okay with this?

03:03.417 --> 03:06.618
High stress levels triggers
my gambling addictions.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.854
If my levels go up...

03:08.856 --> 03:10.322
(donkey braying)

03:10.324 --> 03:13.292
See, it reminds me
I'm being a jackass.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.459
Hell, I could do that for you.

03:15.695 --> 03:16.762
I'll be upstairs.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.430
Hey, seriously,
what's wrong?

03:18.432 --> 03:19.431
I'm fine.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.266
Clearly.

03:23.903 --> 03:27.239
So is ralph.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.941
Yep.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.576
He hacked
the thermometer.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.578
Recalibrated
the digital display.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.746
He did what?
Ralph?

03:34.748 --> 03:36.381
Walter:
He hates school.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.849
We all did.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.686
Especially those of us
with math proficiency.

03:41.754 --> 03:43.956
You know, to get
through the day,

03:43.958 --> 03:45.591
I would look
at the clock

03:45.593 --> 03:46.858
And I'd create
formulas

03:46.860 --> 03:48.493
Expressing
trigonomic functions

03:48.495 --> 03:49.861
Based on the
clock hands.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.397
My sister suggested that to me
a long time ago.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.765
Oh, I didn't know
you had a sister.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.467
Is she...

03:55.469 --> 03:56.602
Enabled, too?

03:56.604 --> 03:57.769
Not like us.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.671
But in her own way.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.809
(phone ringing)

04:03.811 --> 04:05.811
Ralph... Backpack.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.514
What's his
story today?

04:09.516 --> 04:10.849
Sylvester:
Don't know.
But that is only

04:10.851 --> 04:12.718
The second time he's ever
mentioned his sister.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.390
Still stalking
your ex-wife?

04:18.392 --> 04:20.259
Ex-fiancÃ©e.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.393
And I am not
"stalking."

04:21.395 --> 04:22.394
I'm keeping current.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.762
Uh-huh.
Walter:
Cabe called.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.731
We're all going to meet
the governor of california.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.266
Toby:
My back-tax status

04:27.268 --> 04:28.367
With the state isn't exactly

04:28.369 --> 04:29.434
What you'd call good.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.702
What's
this about?

04:30.704 --> 04:32.037
He said hurry,
all right?
So let's hurry.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.639
Paige,

04:33.641 --> 04:34.640
Ralph's school is on the way,

04:34.642 --> 04:35.774
So we'll drop him off.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.842
Come on, guys!

04:43.850 --> 04:45.684
The new car
rides nice.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.586
Steady paycheck equals
safe car for my kid.

04:47.588 --> 04:48.787
Toby:
Heavy security.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.888
Way more than
you'd expect

04:49.890 --> 04:51.423
For the governor.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.691
Walter, why is there a van

04:52.693 --> 04:54.326
From the center for
disease control here?

04:54.328 --> 04:55.327
Walter:
I don't know.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.428
We'll find out pretty soon.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.562
Uh, they handle
diseases that

04:57.564 --> 04:58.964
Wipe out
civilizations.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.565
Diseases that
have no cure.

05:00.567 --> 05:01.633
And they're,
they're here.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.035
It's gonna be
fine, come on.

05:03.037 --> 05:05.304
Good, you're here.
Follow me.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.506
Wait, why are you wearing a
surgical mask around your neck?

05:07.508 --> 05:08.874
What exactly are you
protecting yourself from?

05:08.876 --> 05:09.875
Cabe:
Relax.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.410
They put up
a quarantine tent.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.845
A quarantine tent?

05:13.847 --> 05:15.047
I will be in the car.

05:15.049 --> 05:17.349
Uh, mr. Gallo, sir?

05:17.351 --> 05:19.551
Possibly communicable disease
in this home?

05:19.553 --> 05:20.886
(donkey braying)

05:20.888 --> 05:23.989
Stress levels are
a tad elevated right now.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.725
Weird, phone's off but
I still hear a donkey.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.694
Cabe:
Today's not the day
to be screwing off.

05:28.696 --> 05:29.761
You two go wait with sylvester.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.442
There's a computer
I need you to look at.

05:45.978 --> 05:47.579
That poor little girl.

06:03.396 --> 06:04.396
Who's that kid?

06:04.398 --> 06:05.764
That's a need-to-know.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.866
You know, what I need to know

06:07.868 --> 06:09.368
Is exactly what's going on.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.569
Otherwise, I can't help.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.605
Cabe:
Guys, this is
governor lane.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.407
This is the man
who can help my daughter?

06:15.409 --> 06:16.541
I'm gonna need to know

06:16.543 --> 06:17.609
Everything that's
happening here.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.044
So governmental
habits

06:19.046 --> 06:21.146
Of proprietary knowledge
and "need to know..."

06:21.148 --> 06:22.547
Jettison that nonsense

06:22.549 --> 06:24.483
Or my efforts to
help your child

06:24.485 --> 06:27.419
Cabe:
You have to forgive
mr. O'brien.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.154
He's brilliant but impolitic.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.889
Don't care what he is,

06:30.891 --> 06:32.157
Long as he helps.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.625
In here...

06:33.627 --> 06:36.027
We're really not trying
to hamper anyone,

06:36.029 --> 06:38.163
But if the public hears
"unknown virus,"

06:38.165 --> 06:39.631
It could
cause panic.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.933
Especially if there's
a political motivation.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.969
What kind
of virus?

06:43.971 --> 06:45.437
She tested
negative for hanta,

06:45.439 --> 06:46.938
Rift valley,
ebola...

06:46.940 --> 06:49.074
Eastern equine encephalitis?
Also negative.

06:49.076 --> 06:53.044
She's only positive
for the common cold.

06:53.046 --> 06:56.448
Of the rarest infective agents
in the world.

06:56.450 --> 06:57.649
They're searching.

06:57.651 --> 07:00.952
Helena's kidneys, liver, lungs:
All shutting down.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.587
Her fever's
cli...

07:04.891 --> 07:06.057
How long?

07:07.460 --> 07:08.960
Cabe:
Doctors said she has

07:08.962 --> 07:10.896
Less than 24 hours.
Walter:
This is a medical problem.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.597
Why am I here?
First of all,

07:12.599 --> 07:15.634
Governor, we're so sorry
this is happening to you.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.869
I have a child, too,

07:17.871 --> 07:19.838
And I can't imagine
how you feel.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.573
All we want to do is help.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.876
Thank you.

07:24.878 --> 07:25.944
Come with me.

07:33.753 --> 07:35.020
Lane:
We found this virus

07:35.022 --> 07:36.922
On helena's laptop
a few hours ago.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.857
Based on this, we're
working on the assumption

07:38.859 --> 07:41.059
That someone made helena
sick intentionally.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.561
Targeting you,
no doubt.

07:42.563 --> 07:43.628
Any idea why?

07:43.630 --> 07:45.497
Immigration reform?
Three strikes?

07:45.499 --> 07:47.098
Those are my
hot-button issues,

07:47.100 --> 07:49.701
But would they prompt this kind
of hostility against my kid?

07:49.703 --> 07:51.770
We're compiling all
threats, past and present.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.238
The fbi, nsa,

07:53.240 --> 07:55.574
Homeland, all the
top computer guys

07:55.576 --> 07:57.576
Been trying to
trace the sender.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.911
The source bounced around
to 15 countries.

07:59.913 --> 08:00.879
We hit a wall.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.247
Agent gallo said that you

08:02.249 --> 08:03.548
And your team were brilliant.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.484
That you could find
out who sent it.

08:05.486 --> 08:09.621
All of your devices are
on the same home network?

08:09.623 --> 08:10.622
Yeah.

08:10.624 --> 08:11.857
Any other computer

08:11.859 --> 08:12.858
Have this virus?

08:12.860 --> 08:13.992
No.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.127
Okay, so he directed the virus

08:16.129 --> 08:18.163
To just helena's
computer.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.664
Anybody else in the house sick?

08:19.666 --> 08:21.166
No.
Walter:
So...

08:21.168 --> 08:23.168
You, your wife and your staff--

08:23.170 --> 08:24.636
They've all been
in her proximity?

08:24.638 --> 08:25.770
Yes.
What are you getting at?

08:25.772 --> 08:26.872
Well, he could have taken out

08:26.874 --> 08:28.540
The whole home network,

08:28.542 --> 08:31.776
But he directed the computer
virus at just your child.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.245
I don't think
it's a coincidence

08:33.247 --> 08:34.880
That no one else
but helena is ill.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.282
Wait, wait.
What does this mean?

08:37.284 --> 08:39.651
Give the girl some cool air.
She's hot enough.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.019
What are
you doing?

08:41.021 --> 08:42.554
No!

08:43.656 --> 08:44.756
You can't catch it.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.091
None of us can.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.659
The virus he placed
on the computer

08:47.661 --> 08:49.027
Is custom-built.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.595
He did the same
with your daughter,

08:50.597 --> 08:52.664
Or why is no
one else ill?
Cabe:
You're saying

08:52.666 --> 08:54.065
He custom-built
a virus

08:54.067 --> 08:56.301
That would make just
this child sick?

08:56.303 --> 08:57.636
Yeah. There's computer hacking,

08:57.638 --> 08:58.904
And more recently,
there's biohacking.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.272
Now, whoever infected

09:00.274 --> 09:02.807
The computer also
infected your daughter.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.543
Until we find
that person

09:04.545 --> 09:07.045
And know exactly what
biological agent he used,

09:07.047 --> 09:08.847
There's not gonna be
any hope for a cure.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.215
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.651
You can't just drop a theory
like that and leave.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.052
Governor, the
helplessness you feel

09:14.054 --> 09:15.887
Will incline you to
irrational behavior.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.656
So please,

09:17.658 --> 09:20.158
Resist the temptation
to do anything stupid,

09:20.160 --> 09:21.660
Like standing
in my way.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.828
Let me do my job.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.113
Sylvester:
I checked the avg scanner,

09:42.115 --> 09:43.582
Came up with nothing.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.750
If we can find a signature

09:45.752 --> 09:46.851
In the viral code,

09:46.853 --> 09:47.953
It'll tell us
who sent it.

09:47.955 --> 09:48.954
Meaning we have nothing.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.589
So far, walt.

09:50.591 --> 09:51.690
Keep your shorts on.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.291
Cabe:
Governor's had

09:53.293 --> 09:55.293
Ten distinct threats
since he took the office.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.728
Four of the perps
are locked up,

09:56.730 --> 09:58.263
Thus leaving six.
Guillermo flacos?

09:58.265 --> 10:01.066
This is way too subtle
for a mexican drug lord.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.367
Oh, announcing your
intent via e-mail?

10:02.369 --> 10:03.635
That's too subtle?

10:03.637 --> 10:05.070
Personally,
I would keep digging.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.071
Walter:
Any on the list

10:06.073 --> 10:07.305
Have computer proficiency

10:07.307 --> 10:09.140
<i>And</i> a knowledge of biophysics?

10:09.142 --> 10:10.609
Well, that'll probably narrow
our list down to zero,

10:10.611 --> 10:11.610
But we'll keep digging.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.144
What I want to
understand is

10:13.146 --> 10:15.313
How you hack into a human being.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.915
I get your dna from anywhere--
a coffee cup,

10:16.917 --> 10:18.149
A piece of gum--

10:18.151 --> 10:19.651
And then I study your genetics

10:19.653 --> 10:22.053
For a deficiency--
say, uh, lung disease--

10:22.055 --> 10:23.622
And then I harness
that genetic sequence

10:23.624 --> 10:25.824
Onto a cold virus
and I blow it in your face.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.359
Or into the air
around you.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.361
I traced the computer
virus' code--

10:29.363 --> 10:32.297
It's no wonder the
government couldn't crack it.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.932
It uses none of the
known building blocks.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.100
That's where you leave it, huh?

10:35.102 --> 10:36.301
With a young girl dying.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.073
All right, trace the ip header.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.375
Study it for patterns.

10:43.377 --> 10:45.343
Maybe that'll get us somewhere.

10:54.787 --> 10:55.987
Don't say "I'm fine."

10:55.989 --> 10:58.089
I was gonna say "I'll live."

10:58.091 --> 10:59.224
What's eating you?

10:59.226 --> 11:00.959
You're acting...
I'm...

11:00.961 --> 11:03.328
I'm tempted to use
the word "emotional."

11:03.330 --> 11:06.731
Particularly challenging
problems create...

11:06.733 --> 11:08.733
Impatience.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.969
But you were already off
this morning when you came in.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.303
You only became "impatient"

11:12.305 --> 11:14.239
When you saw that little girl
in her bed.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.307
Yeah, she reminded me
of a problem I couldn't solve.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.677
You realize the more evasive you
are, the more I'll press.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.011
All right.

11:20.013 --> 11:24.916
As a child my, uh,
sister got sick.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.151
She survived.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.285
She's fine.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.188
Like you, all day.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.824
All right, you know what?
I couldn't help her.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.259
It felt like she
was being beaten,

11:34.261 --> 11:35.994
And I was handcuffed.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.429
I couldn't solve her problem.

11:37.431 --> 11:40.965
And that's how you felt,
seeing that girl today?

11:40.967 --> 11:42.867
Sylvester:
Walter!

11:42.869 --> 11:44.769
We've got
something!
Thank you for
the bandage.

11:44.771 --> 11:47.005
All right,
hide the mugs,

11:47.007 --> 11:49.074
I'm coming down!

12:11.330 --> 12:13.798
Okay, so we've successfully
mirrored the infected laptop.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.734
The good news is--
we traced the e-mail.

12:15.736 --> 12:16.968
The bad news--
it doesn't just bounce off

12:16.970 --> 12:18.069
A few servers
around the world.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.738
It's caught
in an endless loop.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.439
That is a dirty one,
it's a good one.

12:21.441 --> 12:24.809
They're using a round-robin
on an ip address,

12:24.811 --> 12:27.378
But it's too clever by half.
It narrows the source.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.782
There's a pattern in the routing
data. You see that prefix?

12:30.784 --> 12:33.785
I know the place
that uses this trick

12:33.787 --> 12:35.420
To mask their
e-mail origins.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.755
Let's go.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.534
Walter: The sophistication
of the e-mail sent

12:49.536 --> 12:51.836
To the governor's daughter
stamps of this place.

12:51.838 --> 12:53.938
It's a known
hacker petri dish.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.940
Toby: One guy makes an
advancement in deception,

12:55.942 --> 12:57.375
Passes it on
to another guy.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.111
It's how silk road
stayed online for so long.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.180
You know that how?

13:04.316 --> 13:06.918
I think we both take
the fifth on that.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.792
Hey! Kill the music!

13:13.794 --> 13:15.193
Homeland security!

13:16.462 --> 13:18.163
I'm looking
for the scumbag that sent

13:18.165 --> 13:20.865
The e-mail virus
to the governor's daughter.

13:22.401 --> 13:24.102
That greaseball
right there.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.171
His wide eyes
and twitching hands

13:26.173 --> 13:28.306
Go beyond the standard
for ten cans of mountain dew.

13:29.909 --> 13:32.143
You. Don't move.

13:40.119 --> 13:42.587
Since when does
walter get physical?

13:42.589 --> 13:44.455
Um...

13:44.457 --> 13:47.192
Never.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.893
Got the job
on craigslist.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.461
I never even
met the client.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.496
(groans)

13:51.498 --> 13:53.498
I think he broke some ribs.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.266
Mm-hmm.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.303
Refocus, or I'll break
the rest of them.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.537
How were you paid?

13:59.539 --> 14:01.573
Cash, to my
p.O. Box.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.474
Great. Untraceable.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.276
I didn't know
about any sick kid.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.178
I just sent
a few anonymous e-mails,

14:07.180 --> 14:08.379
And I pocketed three grand.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.314
Sorry,
<i>e-mails?</i>

14:09.316 --> 14:10.381
More than one?

14:10.383 --> 14:12.283
I sent four total.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.919
All the same--
"it's your fault she's sick."

14:14.921 --> 14:16.621
So, there <i>are</i>
<i>more victims?</i>

14:18.424 --> 14:20.191
Sir, we identified
the three other victims.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.593
They're all children.

14:21.595 --> 14:22.961
My god.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.162
They're all as sick
as your daughter.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.397
Sons and daughters
of dwight carrington,

14:26.399 --> 14:28.900
Victoria cooper,
and john tuttle.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.501
Wait, I know them.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.504
You were all employees of
vlaxco pharmaceuticals in 2008.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.139
That's before I went
into politics.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.341
I only worked there for a year
in risk management.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.209
There's a drug called trexicane.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.345
You all worked
on its development.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.447
Trexicane had promise
as a cure for sma--

14:42.449 --> 14:43.882
It's spinal
muscular atrophy.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.317
It causes your
muscles to waste away

14:46.319 --> 14:49.153
The clinical trial
was going really well

14:49.155 --> 14:51.055
Until vlaxco pulled the plug.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.024
Yeah, it also worked well
on asthma.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.592
It was redeveloped solely
for asthma.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.094
Way more profit, huh?

14:56.096 --> 14:58.062
Left all the sma sufferers
out in the cold.

15:00.499 --> 15:02.233
I spent months fielding
their angry phone calls.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.601
I hated the job.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.905
But how it this related
to helena?

15:06.907 --> 15:08.606
We think that whoever attacked
helena and these other children

15:08.608 --> 15:10.475
Must be someone
who suffered from sma.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.176
And they're trying
to make us suffer, too?

15:12.178 --> 15:13.511
What kind of mind
thinks this way?

15:13.513 --> 15:15.046
Well, the kind that sends
taunting e-mails

15:15.048 --> 15:16.648
Alongside his deadly disease.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.517
So, someone in enough
psychological pain to not care

15:19.519 --> 15:21.920
About how stupid that is
from a criminal standpoint.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.389
Okay, is this headed
towards ransom?

15:24.391 --> 15:25.690
More likely, like his experience
with trexicane,

15:25.692 --> 15:28.059
He's saying there is
a cure out there,

15:28.061 --> 15:29.394
You just can't have it.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.562
This person would need
high scientific aptitude

15:31.564 --> 15:34.299
And access to cutting-edge
genetic sequencers.

15:34.301 --> 15:39.170
I got thousands of complaints
after the trial ended.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.139
Our best bet at finding
someone that angry enough

15:41.141 --> 15:43.274
To infect your daughter
and three other children

15:43.276 --> 15:46.644
None of the other families work
at vlaxco anymore.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.679
You're the governor.

15:47.681 --> 15:50.014
Convince vlaxco
to hand them over.

15:50.016 --> 15:52.283
I'll beg if I have to.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.186
(sighs)
where are cabe and sylvester?

15:55.188 --> 15:58.289
If you don't take care
of yourself,

15:58.291 --> 15:59.557
Then you can't
help anyone else.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.359
Are you barking
at me now?

16:01.361 --> 16:03.261
I'm here to
help you guys.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.697
They're here.

16:09.234 --> 16:10.702
Hey, when are we getting
the vlaxco records?

16:10.704 --> 16:12.370
Vlaxco says they're not gonna
give them to us, yet.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.639
They want to help, but
their lawyers are complaining

16:14.641 --> 16:16.174
About breaking
patient confidentiality

16:16.176 --> 16:20.244
They say it'll take 12 hours
to get us access.

16:20.246 --> 16:24.048
Walter, I saw
the governor's daughter,

16:24.050 --> 16:25.483
She doesn't have 12 hours.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.552
Kid's dying,
and they're stonewalling.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.120
Bastards
won't budge.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.189
What about
a court order?

16:31.191 --> 16:33.024
24 hours, at least.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.292
How hard did you
push them, cabe?

16:35.995 --> 16:38.363
You know me.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.531
I tried as hard
as I could.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.203
I've been trying to
hack vlaxco's records,

16:45.205 --> 16:46.671
But all confidential
drug trials

16:46.673 --> 16:48.673
Are kept on an
air-gapped system.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.508
That means not connected
to the web.

16:50.510 --> 16:55.046
If I had another coffee cup in
my hand right now, I'd smash it.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.280
I don't think
I'd blame you.

17:03.455 --> 17:04.322
Cabe.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.257
Hmm.
Call the governor.

17:06.259 --> 17:09.227
Ask if vlaxco keeps hard copies
of the study files.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.628
Why am I asking?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.163
We're gonna break in.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.805
I understand that we need
to get all the patients

17:20.807 --> 17:23.408
For the vlaxco drug trial.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.144
I get that that is where
we're going to find the person

17:26.146 --> 17:31.716
But I think <i>I</i> would be better
suited for an advisory role.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.451
Walter: Sylvester,
if cabe gets caught,

17:33.453 --> 17:35.153
It's federal time.
If paige gets caught,

17:35.155 --> 17:38.122
She loses ralph. Happy and toby
are the distraction.

17:39.692 --> 17:43.327
N-n-no, you need to memorize the
files. No one else can do that.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.163
It's over a
hundred pages long.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.431
I'm gonna be
reading the layout

17:46.433 --> 17:48.099
And guiding you
through the building, okay?

17:48.101 --> 17:49.367
Okay.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.169
I'm still not clear
on what this has to do

17:51.171 --> 17:52.837
With earl's sub shop
across the street.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.473
Well, vlaxco has
a brutal security firewall

17:55.475 --> 17:57.775
That would take hours to hack.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.078
But they also have hundreds of
employees. So, statistically,

18:00.080 --> 18:02.413
One of them is gonna order
from earl's today.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.248
Now, I've hacked
into the sub shop's server

18:04.250 --> 18:08.453
And I've placed a trojan shell
on their pdf menu.

18:08.455 --> 18:12.090
Your trojan horse is a
two-for-one sub coupon.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.392
That's a really good deal.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.128
Earl knows his way
around a hoagie.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.530
Now, as soon as someone
clicks on the pdf menu

18:19.532 --> 18:20.765
And downloads the coupon,

18:20.767 --> 18:23.167
We're past the vlaxco firewall.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.836
It's lunchtime, so it
shouldn't take long.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.807
(laughs)
I'm in.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.743
All right,
just going through hr.

18:32.745 --> 18:36.280
Just looking through
the employee security badges.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.283
All right, look for someone
in middle management.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.886
A guy driving
a low-level luxury sedan,

18:41.888 --> 18:43.521
Trying to keep up with the vps.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.889
That's someone that can
really get angry.

18:44.891 --> 18:45.823
Mmm.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.658
Jed hausler.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.327
Just copying his data.

18:49.329 --> 18:52.597
Should have a bogus
security badge in a few seconds.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.665
I'm heading
over to happy.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.733
Good luck, sly.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.268
Cabe:
Governor.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.203
We may have some good news
for you here in a while.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.772
It's an involved
operation,

19:01.774 --> 19:04.809
I'll run it down for you later.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.411
My thoughts and prayers are
with you, governor.

19:07.413 --> 19:08.746
How is she?

19:08.748 --> 19:10.481
She's holding on
as best she can.

19:12.217 --> 19:13.885
Walter lied to me earlier
about his sister.

19:13.887 --> 19:16.487
Said she'd gotten over
a childhood illness,

19:16.489 --> 19:18.422
But I saw a letter that said

19:18.424 --> 19:20.725
She's in a care facility
battling ms.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.661
He doesn't talk about her much.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.429
I know, but when
he's reminded of her,

19:25.431 --> 19:26.898
He smashes things
and tackles people

19:26.900 --> 19:31.669
I'm just trying to give him
as much space as I can.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.509
Toby:
Third message.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.945
Just want to reiterate,
I am making real money now.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.947
Can start to re-pay you.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.415
Even if you're seeing someone.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.516
It's totally immaterial.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.485
(car honks)

19:47.487 --> 19:49.687
You can call me back anytime.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.393
(monitor makes donkey noise)

19:57.529 --> 20:00.198
She's not getting
back with you.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.600
Look, people only
let you down.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.835
Sooner you realize
that, the better.

20:04.837 --> 20:08.472
When I was two my dad took me
saint luke's

20:08.474 --> 20:11.242
Handed me to a nurse and said
find her a good home

20:11.244 --> 20:14.812
Based on how my brain works, I
remember every moment of it

20:14.814 --> 20:16.280
So 25 years later

20:16.282 --> 20:17.415
I'm not cynical.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.416
I'm smart.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.650
You put a
quarter-inch wrench

20:19.652 --> 20:20.651
On a quarter-inch bolt,

20:20.653 --> 20:21.652
It works.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.687
Tools don't
let you down.

20:22.689 --> 20:26.591
Spending your life scared
to connect to anyone

20:26.593 --> 20:27.792
Isn't any way to live.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.294
(computer beeps)

20:31.563 --> 20:34.565
Software just picked up
jed hausler's license plate.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.700
Let's go find his car.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.569
The laboratories have
disease samples, walter.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.705
Like the plague.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.773
They have
the actual plague.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.775
Sylvester, you're not going
near the biohazard lab.

20:44.777 --> 20:47.245
I'm gonna be talking you
through the whole way.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.846
Okay, you
guys ready?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.649
Looking for
jed hausler's car.

20:53.685 --> 20:55.720
There!
Punch it, sister!

20:58.557 --> 20:59.991
(car alarm whooping)

21:03.695 --> 21:05.529
Toby:
Excuse me.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.431
My wife is
the world's worst driver.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.933
Could you find out
who owns this car?

21:12.604 --> 21:13.704
You can do this.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.273
You just walk in,

21:15.275 --> 21:16.707
Look at the files,

21:16.709 --> 21:18.609
You walk out.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.412
Walk in, look, walk out.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.982
Walter:
That's our guy. Sylvester...

21:24.984 --> 21:28.286
You need to get out of there
before he comes back

21:28.288 --> 21:29.553
And swipes his real id.

21:29.555 --> 21:31.289
Okay.

21:40.866 --> 21:41.866
Toby:
Oh...

21:41.868 --> 21:44.835
What the hell did
you do to my car?

21:44.837 --> 21:46.337
Not me. Him.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.772
Who was driving?

21:47.774 --> 21:49.006
You distracted me.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.708
Oh, talking is a distraction?

21:50.710 --> 21:51.809
Constant complaining
is distraction.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.511
Hausler:
Hey!

21:53.513 --> 21:55.613
Can we please talk about
the damage to my car?

21:55.615 --> 21:56.647
My bad.

21:56.649 --> 21:57.648
Love the 'stache.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.318
Um... $300,
we'll call it a day?

22:00.320 --> 22:02.353
There's thousands
in damage here.

22:02.355 --> 22:03.688
$350.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.957
Just give me your
insurance papers.

22:10.962 --> 22:13.631
Hey, you recently divorced?

22:13.633 --> 22:15.366
There's a tan line where
your wedding ring would be.

22:15.368 --> 22:17.034
I only ask

22:17.036 --> 22:21.005
'cause... I think I'm about
to pull that trigger myself.

22:24.509 --> 22:25.810
Walter:
All right.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.878
You're looking for 2008,
January to August.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.880
Trexicane trial program.

22:31.383 --> 22:33.050
Okay.
I hope this is it.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.953
Okay, get the name of every
patient in the trial.

22:46.631 --> 22:48.099
How long is that
going to take?

22:48.101 --> 22:49.567
Accuracy
is bliss.

22:49.569 --> 22:50.935
Do you see this?

22:50.937 --> 22:53.371
Cold as
pennsylvania steel.

22:53.373 --> 22:54.839
Maybe if you knew
how to warm me up...
(phone chimes)

22:54.841 --> 22:56.440
That's my supervisor,

22:56.442 --> 22:57.775
Who's going to kick my ass.

22:57.777 --> 22:58.976
Hold on.
He can wait.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.945
You're the guy just
a step ahead of me:

23:00.947 --> 23:02.446
You're back in
the single scene,

23:02.448 --> 23:04.048
Trading boxers
for briefs,

23:04.050 --> 23:06.016
Hitting the gym,
scoring hair plugs...

23:06.018 --> 23:08.386
Get the hell out of my way
and leave your info at the desk.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.724
Not good.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.659
Yeah, we couldn't hold
our patsy any longer.

23:15.661 --> 23:17.762
He's heading back in.
There he is.

23:24.603 --> 23:26.804
Mr. Hausler, it's saying
you're already in here.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.539
Well, clearly, I'm not.

23:30.041 --> 23:31.942
I don't want you to panic,
but the guards know

23:31.944 --> 23:33.010
You're in the building.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.044
Oh, boy...

23:34.046 --> 23:35.813
Okay...

23:38.483 --> 23:40.518
Walter:
Security's been alerted.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.619
They are coming
toward the file room.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.421
Okay. All done.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.055
Walter:
Now, you can get out
through the doors

23:45.057 --> 23:46.457
In the back.
To your left.

23:49.995 --> 23:51.796
Walter, you said no biohazard.

23:51.798 --> 23:52.897
You have to.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.632
Anthrax!

23:54.634 --> 23:56.634
Last year the cdc exposed 86

23:56.636 --> 23:58.769
Of their own people to anthrax.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.438
Walter, there could be
anthrax back there.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.639
Listen to me,
you have no other way out.

24:01.641 --> 24:02.640
Walter, there's got to be...

24:02.642 --> 24:03.641
(door bangs open)

24:03.643 --> 24:04.708
Walter!

24:10.882 --> 24:13.484
Walter (over comms):
We see you on the security cam.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.518
I am in a dirty room, walter.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.455
Head out the east side door.
Do you see it?

24:17.457 --> 24:18.722
Yes.

24:18.724 --> 24:19.723
Walter:
Now, there's a service hall

24:19.725 --> 24:21.559
On the other side.
Head down there

24:21.561 --> 24:23.761
To the exit, where
we'll be waiting for you.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.863
Sylvester,
pick up the pace, pal.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.532
I don't know if you can push him
too hard here, walter.

24:28.534 --> 24:30.201
This is my worst nightmare.
Literally.

24:30.203 --> 24:32.470
I have had this one.

24:33.572 --> 24:35.005
Oh...

24:35.007 --> 24:37.141
Guards are getting
closer, sylvester.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.642
I can't touch that handle.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.045
One of the cleanest
handles in the world.

24:41.047 --> 24:44.648
I don't touch those either!
Open the damn door,

24:44.650 --> 24:45.816
Because if you think
this lab's dirty,

24:45.818 --> 24:46.917
Wait until
you're in a prison cell,

24:46.919 --> 24:48.152
Which is where
they will take you

24:48.154 --> 24:49.487
If you don't open the door.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.088
No.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.256
Come on, sylvester.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.757
Get the hell out of there, now.

24:53.759 --> 24:55.092
You cannot be impatient
with him. Sylvester...

24:55.094 --> 24:56.494
It's paige.

24:56.496 --> 24:57.795
What if you take
off your sweater

24:57.797 --> 24:58.762
And put it around your hand?

24:58.764 --> 24:59.930
What kind of deterrent

24:59.932 --> 25:00.931
Against a lethal spore

25:00.933 --> 25:02.066
Is a poly-cotton blend?

25:02.068 --> 25:05.503
What are you going
to do with your money?

25:05.505 --> 25:07.671
Get rid of it.
Money makes me nervous.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.106
Okay, then close your eyes
and get rid of it.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.708
Okay.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.243
You need to hand
over the money...

25:12.245 --> 25:13.210
All right.
Oh...

25:13.212 --> 25:14.678
Paige:
Pull down...

25:14.680 --> 25:16.747
And run like hell!

25:22.254 --> 25:23.754
(tires screeching)

25:34.232 --> 25:36.033
(tires squealing)

25:44.910 --> 25:46.110
Her fever's worse.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.611
She's in
decline.

25:47.613 --> 25:49.847
Where are we, folks?

25:49.849 --> 25:52.149
Well, based on the names
sylvester got us,

25:52.151 --> 25:55.019
We're pulling background on the
people from the vlaxco trial.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.687
Now we can look for our suspect.

25:56.689 --> 25:59.256
The last participant
in the trial.

26:00.792 --> 26:02.860
So, we have
50 names here.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.328
One of them is our biohacker.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.597
How do we
narrow it down?

26:06.599 --> 26:08.098
Our bad guy's
gotten kids sick

26:08.100 --> 26:10.067
And made sure the parents knew
it was done intentionally.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.168
That's a real
angry dude.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.269
Take it from someone
who has dropped

26:12.271 --> 26:13.804
A fortune at games of chance:

26:13.806 --> 26:16.106
Nothing makes the psyche
more vindictive than loss.

26:16.108 --> 26:17.207
It's primal;

26:17.209 --> 26:18.943
Through vengeance,
humans wrongly believe

26:18.945 --> 26:20.010
They can be
made whole again.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.579
We need to
find whoever

26:21.581 --> 26:24.081
Lost the most from this drug
not being approved.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.116
So, 20 test subjects showed
no improvement from the drugs.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.618
So they didn't really
lose anything

26:27.620 --> 26:28.652
From being part of the trial.

26:28.654 --> 26:29.753
They entered sick,
they left sick.

26:29.755 --> 26:31.255
We're down
to 30.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.590
Same with those who
got the placebo--

26:32.592 --> 26:34.024
Their situation didn't change.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.626
They might have been
disappointed

26:35.628 --> 26:37.027
They didn't get the real drug,
but that's not loss.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.762
Five died since
the trial ended.

26:38.764 --> 26:39.830
They're all out.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.198
Okay, here's where we get down

26:41.200 --> 26:42.967
To the nitty-gritty.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.835
The guys left have
all suffered loss.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.770
All would have improved
with the trexicane drug.

26:50.041 --> 26:51.075
Benjamin carlisle, maybe?

26:51.077 --> 26:52.643
32 years old,

26:52.645 --> 26:54.979
Entrepreneur making six figures.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.614
When he started
the study,

26:56.616 --> 26:57.815
He was engaged--
world on a string.

26:57.817 --> 27:01.118
Begging for charity
for his treatment,

27:01.120 --> 27:02.920
Blogging
pretty angrily

27:02.922 --> 27:06.123
Regarding his
degenerating condition...

27:06.125 --> 27:07.858
And no longer engaged.

27:07.860 --> 27:10.928
If I lost a fiancÃ©e
to a disease

27:10.930 --> 27:12.997
That could have been cured,
I'd consider revenge.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.999
Cabe:
That's not the guy.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.667
This is.

27:16.669 --> 27:17.768
Robert richter.

27:17.770 --> 27:19.203
Single dad.

27:19.205 --> 27:20.304
According to
this, his child

27:20.306 --> 27:21.805
Responded well to the meds

27:21.807 --> 27:23.641
But died after the drug trial
was scrapped.

27:25.043 --> 27:26.877
He lost more than anyone.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.147
You're basing this
purely on emotion.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.316
There's entire sections
of jurisprudence

27:32.318 --> 27:33.951
Based on crimes of passion.

27:33.953 --> 27:37.421
Emotion is as good
as any of them.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.923
Especially in
a case like this.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.425
Trust me.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.294
Guys?
There's a robert richter

27:44.296 --> 27:47.831
That works at venice
college of science.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.801
And he is
a microbiology professor.

27:58.109 --> 28:00.110
Walter:
There should be some evidence
here in richter's office.

28:02.914 --> 28:04.748
Assistant:
I'm sorry,
mr. Richter

28:04.750 --> 28:05.983
Is gone
for the day.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.052
Um, maybe I should call
campus security first?

28:08.054 --> 28:10.387
Feel free, but my
badge is bigger.

28:10.389 --> 28:13.190
We'll take it
from here.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.925
All I have in here
are exam papers.

28:14.927 --> 28:15.993
Same here.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.194
Oh, oh, oh.
Look what I found.

28:20.165 --> 28:22.766
He was computer modeling
spray patterns.

28:22.768 --> 28:25.069
I bet he loads

28:25.071 --> 28:26.470
A small aerosol device
with the virus;

28:26.472 --> 28:28.138
All he's got to do
is get a few feet

28:28.140 --> 28:29.907
From the victim,
presses a button

28:29.909 --> 28:31.208
And then he infects
them with a gene

28:31.210 --> 28:32.476
That'll kill
only them.

28:33.778 --> 28:35.279
Target never even knows.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.047
That's a pretty sophisticated
murder weapon.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.182
And scary easy to make.

28:38.184 --> 28:42.786
Graphene-based
nanochannel hardware...

28:42.788 --> 28:44.888
Today, genetic engineering
is a hobby;

28:44.890 --> 28:46.190
If you're smart enough,

28:46.192 --> 28:48.192
You can be a modern
typhoid mary.

28:56.768 --> 28:58.202
Uh... What are you doing?

28:58.204 --> 29:00.170
Happy was right.

29:00.172 --> 29:05.476
Richter is a modern typhoid
mary, emphasis on modern.

29:05.478 --> 29:08.779
His daughter died in 2010.

29:08.781 --> 29:11.415
The reason he had to wait
years to retaliate is he had

29:11.417 --> 29:13.350
To wait for
technology to catch up

29:13.352 --> 29:15.119
To his plans.
But now that it has,

29:15.121 --> 29:17.321
The same technology might be
the thing that stops him.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.255
Here.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.790
Saved in the memory

29:19.792 --> 29:21.492
Are the sequences
for the killer genes.

29:21.494 --> 29:23.861
And how does that help us?
(printer whirs)

29:23.863 --> 29:26.063
We send this to cdc,

29:26.065 --> 29:27.397
They can follow the
blueprint backwards

29:27.399 --> 29:30.367
To reverse-engineer
what richter did in two hours.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.269
They can save
the people he infected.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.771
They can make
an antidote.

29:35.039 --> 29:36.473
Before I send this...

29:36.475 --> 29:37.541
I'm positive.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.443
Great work.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.080
(laughs)

29:43.082 --> 29:45.048
Well, considering we
just saved four kids,

29:45.050 --> 29:46.383
Maybe we earned
a celebratory toast.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.252
Sylvester?

29:48.254 --> 29:49.953
Uh, you really think
I'm gonna drink something

29:49.955 --> 29:51.188
Out of a bio lab's fridge?

29:52.223 --> 29:54.291
(toby whoops)

29:54.293 --> 29:56.193
Well... Yeah.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.494
Don't celebrate just yet.

29:58.997 --> 30:00.564
There's another sequence here.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.833
There's a fifth target.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.368
Paige: Fifth target?
Walter: Mm-hmm.

30:04.370 --> 30:07.171
That spam creep said he only
sent four e-mail viruses.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.939
Well, maybe this guy
didn't get an e-mail

30:08.941 --> 30:10.908
'cause he's special
to richter.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.210
Special how?

30:13.212 --> 30:15.078
Walter:
This sequence also appears

30:15.080 --> 30:18.015
In a file in richter's laptop
referring to...

30:24.389 --> 30:25.923
It's the governor.

30:28.561 --> 30:32.129
But the sequence
is different
from the others.

30:32.131 --> 30:34.565
The sequence targets
a potassium channel

30:34.567 --> 30:37.100
In the heart,
killing the person instantly.

30:41.406 --> 30:43.307
He's not at his house.

30:43.309 --> 30:44.975
His wife said
he ditched security,

30:44.977 --> 30:46.510
Went out the back.
They don't know where he went.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.312
The only thing that can keep
a man away from his dying child

30:48.314 --> 30:50.280
Is if he thinks
he can make her better.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.149
Richter called him.

30:52.151 --> 30:54.117
Promised him an antidote

30:54.119 --> 30:56.887
If the governor would meet
with him and just hear him out.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.990
He's not gonna give the
governor an antidote.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.191
He's gonna give him the virus.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.026
It's not just gonna
make him suffer.

31:03.028 --> 31:05.495
It's gonna stop the
governor's heart

31:05.497 --> 31:07.097
Within seconds.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.006
I put an alarm
on the governor's family car.

31:16.008 --> 31:19.543
Why the hell isn't he
answering his cell phone?

31:19.545 --> 31:22.179
It's not on and even if it were,
he wouldn't answer.

31:22.181 --> 31:23.413
Checking gps.

31:23.415 --> 31:26.049
We'll track him soon.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.584
Toby, what about richter?
I'm getting a bead

31:27.586 --> 31:28.886
On his phone, too.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.320
Happy:
I got richter's cell records.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.890
Last call was to governor lane,
15 minutes ago.

31:32.892 --> 31:33.957
Walter:
I warned the governor

31:33.959 --> 31:35.058
About irrational behavior.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.526
I told him not
to do anything stupid.

31:38.162 --> 31:39.463
Got him!
Got the governor.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.965
He's at marina beach plaza.
Toby: Really?

31:41.967 --> 31:43.667
Well, then we got a problem,
'cause so is richter.

31:49.140 --> 31:51.208
(indistinct radio transmission)

31:52.911 --> 31:54.978
Spread out!
We need to find the governor!

31:55.613 --> 31:57.681
I'm heading to the upper level!

32:04.455 --> 32:06.056
I got nothing up here!

32:06.958 --> 32:09.326
Ditto that in the...

32:09.328 --> 32:11.194
Rotunda.

32:11.196 --> 32:12.296
Woman:
Lower level's clear.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.530
Okay, okay.

32:13.532 --> 32:14.631
Think about
how this would go down.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.066
He sees the police and knows

32:16.068 --> 32:18.168
It's got to happen fast
but private.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.938
(indistinct radio transmission)

32:23.074 --> 32:24.207
Toby, anything?

32:24.209 --> 32:25.242
He wouldn't wait in the open.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.510
Not with all the police.

32:26.512 --> 32:28.011
Someplace in here,
but someplace quiet.

32:28.013 --> 32:29.346
Side hallways maybe.

32:34.152 --> 32:35.252
I found richter!

32:35.254 --> 32:37.521
We're on our way.

32:43.728 --> 32:45.228
He's moving towards the target.

32:45.230 --> 32:46.563
I got eyes on him!

32:49.400 --> 32:51.501
Cabe, if he even gets close,
governor lane is dead!

32:51.503 --> 32:54.371
Homeland security! Don't move!

32:54.373 --> 32:57.607
(grunts)

32:57.609 --> 33:00.410
He expelled the virus!

33:00.412 --> 33:02.145
It'll be aerosolized in...
Sylvester:
Ten seconds!

33:02.147 --> 33:03.680
Based on where
the governor is standing,

33:03.682 --> 33:05.148
The interior wind patterns

33:05.150 --> 33:07.150
And s-scattergrams!

33:07.152 --> 33:08.018
Now, you have seven seconds.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.252
Woman:
You can't do that!

33:09.254 --> 33:10.988
What are you doing?
Making it rain.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.689
What?
To take down the virus.

33:14.092 --> 33:15.225
Two seconds, walter!

33:17.295 --> 33:19.196
(crowd gasping, clamoring)

33:22.300 --> 33:24.401
(indistinct radio transmission)

33:29.107 --> 33:30.707
How do we know this worked?

33:30.709 --> 33:33.410
Well, if it didn't,
he'd be dead by now.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.589
He said he had an antidote!
No, sir.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.758
We already sent the antidote
for your daughter.

33:47.760 --> 33:48.759
He was trying to kill you.

33:53.064 --> 33:54.664
Agent gallo,

33:54.666 --> 33:56.199
She's gonna be fine.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.801
So glad to hear it, governor.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.302
I'll tell my team.

34:03.241 --> 34:07.044
The antidote the cdc
synthesized is working.

34:07.046 --> 34:09.613
Helena's fever broke.

34:09.615 --> 34:11.748
We're getting reports of the
same from the other victims.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.817
(intercom beeps)

34:15.119 --> 34:17.254
Richter: You think I care--
getting caught?

34:17.256 --> 34:19.256
Dying in prison?

34:19.258 --> 34:21.391
I died when my daughter did.

34:21.393 --> 34:22.759
I just didn't feel

34:22.761 --> 34:24.428
That I should be the only one

34:24.430 --> 34:25.629
To feel the pain I experienced.

34:25.631 --> 34:27.631
You're not.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.633
I know what it feels like to sit

34:29.635 --> 34:32.502
At your child's bedside.

34:32.504 --> 34:36.139
Watching each breath they take,
praying it won't be their last.

34:36.141 --> 34:39.376
To hold your daughter's hand,

34:39.378 --> 34:42.679
Trying to memorize
what it feels like

34:42.681 --> 34:45.449
So you won't forget.

34:47.819 --> 34:50.620
Your daughter

34:50.622 --> 34:52.522
Too scared to close her eyes,

34:52.524 --> 34:55.492
Even when she's so tired,
because she's worried

34:55.494 --> 34:57.594
She won't be able
to open them again.

34:57.596 --> 35:01.431
Some things you just can't fix.

35:01.433 --> 35:04.434
You got to live with them.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.671
You don't take innocent lives.

35:09.140 --> 35:11.208
We shouldn't be
listening to this.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.781
That man deserved to die.

35:17.783 --> 35:21.418
They all deserved
to feel my pain!

35:21.420 --> 35:24.821
No, they didn't.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.890
No one deserves it.

35:29.527 --> 35:32.195
Hey, I'm going
to get ralph.

35:32.197 --> 35:33.797
I got him a
new telescope.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.299
And I thought we might set
it up on the roof and grill.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.567
Want to join us?

35:37.569 --> 35:39.769
Uh, maybe later, but thanks.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.505
Okay.

35:41.507 --> 35:44.241
Isn't that called
"trying to unring a bell"?

35:44.243 --> 35:46.710
(laughs)

35:46.712 --> 35:48.712
Sometimes it's okay to admit
you don't have all the answers.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.315
You know about my sister,
don't you?

35:52.317 --> 35:54.284
How she's still sick?

35:54.286 --> 35:56.353
It's not really my business.

35:56.355 --> 35:59.623
I was just trying
to help you today.

36:01.492 --> 36:02.759
For me,

36:02.761 --> 36:04.761
My mind...

36:04.763 --> 36:07.531
Every problem has a solution.

36:09.567 --> 36:12.536
There must be
a solution for her.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.409
Hey.

36:21.612 --> 36:22.746
I should never have

36:22.748 --> 36:25.182
Yelled at you earlier.

36:25.184 --> 36:27.217
You're the bravest person
I've ever met.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.885
That girl would've

36:28.887 --> 36:30.754
Died today without you.

36:30.756 --> 36:33.757
Without us.

36:36.761 --> 36:38.495
Cabe:
Federal transpo

36:38.497 --> 36:41.531
Just came around back
and picked up richter.

36:41.533 --> 36:45.602
Ralph and I were gonna barbecue
some burgers up on the roof.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.370
It would really help
if you could keep

36:47.372 --> 36:49.372
An eye on him
while I work the grill.

36:59.650 --> 37:00.884
(school bell rings)

37:00.886 --> 37:03.386
Woman:
<i>Can I help you?</i>

37:03.388 --> 37:04.688
Yes, uh, this is for the kids.

37:04.690 --> 37:08.358
But nothing for the
biology department.

37:08.360 --> 37:11.494
Or a-a lab of any kind.

37:11.496 --> 37:13.563
Something fun?

37:16.367 --> 37:18.468
And safe.

37:36.520 --> 37:37.420
(playful clamoring nearby)

37:42.393 --> 37:44.327
Toby:
<i>Hi. This is</i>
<i>dr. Tobias m. Curtis.</i>

37:44.329 --> 37:45.495
<i>Please leave a message.</i>
<i>(beeps)</i>

37:45.497 --> 37:46.963
Woman:
<i>Hi, toby. It's me.</i>

37:46.965 --> 37:49.499
<i>I'm really glad</i>
<i>things are going well for you.</i>

37:49.501 --> 37:51.268
<i>But I don't care</i>
<i>about the money you owe.</i>

37:51.270 --> 37:53.637
<i>I moved on.</i>

37:53.639 --> 37:55.305
<i>Please do the same.</i>

37:55.307 --> 37:58.675
<i>And don't call again. Bye.</i>

37:58.677 --> 38:00.710
All in.

38:00.712 --> 38:02.312
You didn't even see
your cards yet.

38:02.314 --> 38:03.580
I don't have to.

38:03.582 --> 38:06.383
I see you.

38:14.592 --> 38:15.625
(laughs):
Hey.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.927
Hi, walter.

38:21.932 --> 38:22.966
Your sister

38:22.968 --> 38:24.367
Is the best patient we have.

38:24.369 --> 38:25.502
Never quits.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.837
(laughs)

38:27.839 --> 38:29.739
I got my first paycheck.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.574
Well, I hope you're
gonna do something fun.

38:31.576 --> 38:32.876
You deserve it.

38:32.878 --> 38:35.312
Yeah, I'm gonna do
something for you.

38:35.314 --> 38:36.413
Hey.

38:37.882 --> 38:41.551
Ms is my fight, not yours.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.620
I'm not gonna
let you die, megan.

38:43.622 --> 38:45.989
I'm going to fix you.

38:49.493 --> 38:52.362
Cabe, another medium-well?

38:52.364 --> 38:53.496
"another"?

38:53.498 --> 38:54.698
The last one was raw.

38:56.534 --> 38:57.667
Hi, walter.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.103
Ralph.

39:00.105 --> 39:02.372
There, I think I'm done, ralph.

39:02.374 --> 39:03.973
Come check this out.

39:08.446 --> 39:09.813
See all the stars?

39:09.815 --> 39:12.749
There's millions
of them up there.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.721
You got a notepad?

39:23.394 --> 39:24.828
Thank you.

39:32.536 --> 39:35.839
You know, having a family
can be a hard thing.

39:37.808 --> 39:40.677
Makes you vulnerable.

39:40.679 --> 39:42.746
I know.

39:48.152 --> 39:50.387
It can be a good thing, too.

39:53.023 --> 39:54.624
I know.

39:58.095 --> 40:01.131
Hey.
Hey.

40:06.137 --> 40:09.172
(laughs)

40:09.174 --> 40:11.508
Hey, ralph?
If you look at the curvature

40:11.510 --> 40:15.178
Of the moon's surface,
orion's belt makes

40:15.180 --> 40:17.847
