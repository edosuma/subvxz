WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.253
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.336 --> 00:05.130
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.213 --> 00:06.756
SO IN THE DEBATE,

00:06.840 --> 00:09.092
IF COUNCILMAN POWELL SUGGESTS
YOU'RE TOO OLD FOR CITY COUNCIL,

00:09.175 --> 00:10.552
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

00:10.635 --> 00:14.597
- I'D SAY I FEEL LIKE
AN ENERGETIC 40-YEAR-OLD.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.809
IN FACT,
I COULD GO FOR ONE RIGHT NOW.

00:21.020 --> 00:23.690
POLITICS
IS A DIRTY BUSINESS.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.777
- OKAY, YOU HAVE GOT
TO STOP BINGE-WATCHING

00:27.861 --> 00:28.778
<i>HOUSE OF CARDS.</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:29.612
YOU'RE NOT KEVIN SPACEY.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.906
STOP TALKING
TO AN IMAGINARY CAMERA.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.743
- OKAY, I'LL STOP.
FINE.

00:34.826 --> 00:37.704
OR WILL I?

00:41.583 --> 00:44.127
- ELKA,
YOU CAN'T JUST WING THIS.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.796
THE WINNER OF THIS DEBATE
HAS WON THE LAST FIVE ELECTIONS.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.840
- I COULD CONCENTRATE
A LOT BETTER

00:48.923 --> 00:51.009
IF I HAD A COCKTAIL.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.802
- JUST BECAUSE THE DEBATE
IS AT THE BAR

00:52.886 --> 00:54.637
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN DRINK.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.140
THE ONLY THING ON THE TABLE
WILL BE A PITCHER OF WATER.

00:57.223 --> 01:00.185
- YOU KNOW WHAT LOOKS
A LOT LIKE A PITCHER OF WATER?

01:02.228 --> 01:04.438
A PITCHER OF VODKA.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.650
JUST SAYING.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.652
- WELL, I'M OFF
TO MEET JJ.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.321
- SO IS IT FINALLY
JUST YOU AND HIM TONIGHT?

01:11.404 --> 01:13.239
- OH, GOD, I HOPE SO.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.824
EVERY TIME WE GO OUT,
HE INVITES PEOPLE

01:14.908 --> 01:16.951
FROM THE NEARBY TABLES
TO COME JOIN US.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.870
- WELL, I SUPPOSE TONIGHT

01:18.953 --> 01:21.539
YOU COULD RESERVE ALL THE TABLES
AROUND YOU WITH FAKE NAMES

01:21.623 --> 01:23.666
SO THAT NO ONE ELSE
SHOWS UP,

01:23.750 --> 01:25.835
BUT THAT WOULD BE
SELFISH AND UNETHICAL.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.170
- YES, THAT WOULD BE.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.338
- YOU ALREADY DID IT,
DIDN'T YOU?

01:28.421 --> 01:31.132
- YES, I DID.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.717
I JUST WISH
I UNDERSTOOD WHY

01:32.801 --> 01:35.595
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE ALONE WITH ME.

01:35.678 --> 01:38.556
- A MYSTERY
FOR THE AGES.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.857
- YOU ALWAYS LOOK
SO ELEGANT.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.359
EVERY TIME
WE GO OUT TOGETHER,

01:49.442 --> 01:52.362
I FEEL LIKE LADY AND THE TRAMP
SHARING A BOWL OF SPAGHETTI.

01:52.445 --> 01:56.658
- OH, DON'T BE SILLY, JJ.
I DON'T EAT CARBS.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.662
SO THIS IS NICE,
ISN'T IT?

02:00.745 --> 02:02.372
JUST THE TWO OF US.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.457
- HI, FOLKS.
WELCOME TO STORMI'S.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.167
AND TRULY,
THANKS FOR COMING.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.669
ALL THESE EMPTY TABLES.
NO-SHOWS.

02:08.752 --> 02:11.548
WHO DOES THAT?

02:11.631 --> 02:13.258
ANYWAY, I'M HEADING OUT,

02:13.341 --> 02:15.051
BUT I'LL TAKE YOUR DRINK ORDERS
AND SEND YOUR WAITER.

02:15.134 --> 02:16.761
- TWO VODKA MARTINIS.
- OKAY.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.389
- AND, HEY,
IF YOUR SHIFT IS OVER,

02:19.472 --> 02:21.850
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US?

02:21.933 --> 02:23.226
- NO, I WOULDN'T WANT
TO INTERRUPT

02:23.309 --> 02:24.561
YOUR ROMANTIC DINNER.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.689
BE RIGHT BACK.

02:27.772 --> 02:30.108
- JJ, HAVE I DONE
SOMETHING WRONG?

02:30.191 --> 02:32.902
WHY ARE YOU AFRAID
TO BE ALONE WITH ME?

02:32.986 --> 02:34.904
ARE YOU NOT ATTRACTED TO ME?

02:34.988 --> 02:39.075
- I'M NUTS ABOUT YOU.
- WELL, THEN WHAT IS IT?

02:39.158 --> 02:41.411
- THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.789
SEE, I STARTED DATING MY WIFE
WHEN SHE WAS NINE YEARS OLD.

02:44.873 --> 02:48.334
- OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

02:48.418 --> 02:52.088
- NO, NO,
I WAS NINE YEARS OLD TOO.

02:52.171 --> 02:55.925
WE WERE CHILDHOOD SWEETHEARTS.
WE EVEN WAITED.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.261
WE WERE VIRGINS
ON OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

02:58.344 --> 03:02.599
- OH, THAT IS SO SWEET
AND DEAR AND OLD-FASHIONED

03:02.682 --> 03:05.810
AND SO YOU.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.061
SO JUST THE ONE?

03:07.145 --> 03:11.941
- YEAH, JUST THE ONE WOMAN,
BUT WE DID IT A LOT OF TIMES.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.276
AND SHE HAD A SUBSCRIPTION
TO <i> COSMO,</i>

03:13.359 --> 03:16.112
SO WE TRIED STUFF.

03:16.195 --> 03:19.282
- YOU'RE ANSWERING QUESTIONS
I'M NOT ASKING.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.826
- WELL, I KNOW
YOU'VE HAD MORE THAN ONE.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.495
YOU'VE PROBABLY HAD MORE
LIKE SEVEN OR EIGHT.

03:24.579 --> 03:29.167
- WELL, SEVEN OR EIGHT
ARE IN THE NUMBER.

03:32.211 --> 03:37.300
- AND I'M NOT THE KIND OF GUY
WHO LIKES TO ADMIT HE'S SCARED.

03:37.383 --> 03:40.011
- WELL, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.597
BUT HOW ABOUT FROM NOW ON
WE KEEP OUR DATES

03:42.680 --> 03:45.266
TO JUST THE TWO OF US?

03:45.350 --> 03:47.810
- DONE.
NOBODY ELSE.

03:50.688 --> 03:54.359
- YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT YOUR KIND OFFER,

03:54.442 --> 03:58.154
AND I'VE BEEN MANAGING
THIS RESTAURANT FOR 15 YEARS,

03:58.237 --> 04:00.990
AND NO ONE'S EVER ASKED ME
TO JOIN THEM BEFORE.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.700
THANK YOU.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.662
AND THE ANSWER IS YES.

04:10.416 --> 04:15.046
SO WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

04:15.129 --> 04:17.507
- WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT FEELINGS

04:17.589 --> 04:19.384
AND OUR RELATIONSHIP

04:19.466 --> 04:20.843
AND THE INS AND OUTS

04:20.927 --> 04:23.221
OF THE EMOTIONAL LANDSCAPE
OF OUR FUTURE.

04:23.304 --> 04:27.016
- MM-HMM.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.018
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I FORGOT.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.979
I DO NEED
TO GET HOME TONIGHT.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.693
- AND THAT'S HOW
YOU GET RID OF A MAN

04:36.776 --> 04:39.904
AND MAKE HIM THINK
IT'S HIS IDEA.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.656
- YEAH, ELKA,
I'M AT THE BAR NOW.

04:41.739 --> 04:44.659
POWELL'S PEOPLE WANT TO SET
THE DEBATE UP IN THE MAIN ROOM.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.869
DONALD?

04:46.953 --> 04:48.371
- MELANIE.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.456
- OH, YEAH,
THAT ENGLISH PROFESSOR

04:50.540 --> 04:53.001
I USED TO DATE IS HERE.

04:53.084 --> 04:56.004
YEAH, HE DOES KIND OF LOOK
LIKE BUZZ LIGHTYEAR.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.051
WOW, DONALD, HI.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.220
SO GREAT TO SEE YOU.
HOW LONG'S IT BEEN?

05:04.303 --> 05:06.889
- LIKE, TWO YEARS, MAYBE.
- WOW.

05:06.973 --> 05:10.018
- YOU STILL LOOK
AS RAVISHING AS EVER.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.060
- WELL,
WHEN YOU TALK LIKE THAT,

05:11.144 --> 05:13.563
IT MAKES ME WONDER
WHAT WE EVER BROKE UP ABOUT.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.064
- WELL, IT'S PEDANTIC
TO INSIST,

05:15.148 --> 05:16.607
BUT ONE SHOULDN'T END
ONE'S SENTENCES

05:16.691 --> 05:19.610
WITH PREPOSITIONS.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.864
- NOW I REMEMBER.

05:22.947 --> 05:26.409
STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN OVER
YOUR TERMINAL POMPOUSNESS, HUH?

05:26.492 --> 05:28.494
- YOU MEAN POMPOSITY,

05:28.578 --> 05:31.622
AND ONE DOESN'T GET OVER
TERMINAL THINGS.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.541
- WELL, YOU'RE A TERMINAL PAIN
IN THE ASS,

05:33.624 --> 05:36.878
AND I GOT OVER YOU.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.505
- DID YOU?

05:39.589 --> 05:41.424
- OKAY, JUST TO BE CLEAR,
IT'S BEEN A LONG DROUGHT,

05:41.507 --> 05:43.968
SO THIS IS PURELY PHYSICAL
FOR ME.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.553
- WELL, FOR ME AS WELL.

05:45.636 --> 05:50.433
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GETTING
ANYTHING INTELLECTUAL.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.393
- OH, MY GOD.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:52.477 --> 05:53.478
YOU HAVE TO GO.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.397
IT MAY SURPRISE YOU,
GIVEN YOUR LOW OPINION OF ME,

05:56.481 --> 05:57.273
BUT I AM HELPING ELKA OUT

05:57.356 --> 05:59.108
WITH HER CAMPAIGN
FOR CITY COUNCIL.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.610
- OH, DOESN'T SURPRISE ME
ONE BIT.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.987
IN FACT,
I KNEW THE ENTIRE TIME.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.614
I'M COACHING HER OPPONENT,
COUNCILMAN POWELL,

06:04.697 --> 06:05.907
FOR THE DEBATE.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.284
- WHAT?
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

06:08.367 --> 06:10.203
I WOULDN'T HAVE SLEPT WITH YOU
IF I'D KNOWN THAT.

06:10.286 --> 06:13.122
- I THINK YOU ANSWERED
YOUR OWN QUESTION.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.249
I'M LIKE ANY OTHER GUY
WHEN IT COMES

06:15.333 --> 06:17.460
TO GETTING SOME FLEETING,
BARBARIAN PLEASURE.

06:20.379 --> 06:23.049
- HOW'S THAT
FOR SOME BARBARIAN PLEASURE?

06:27.053 --> 06:29.097
[upbeat music]

06:29.180 --> 06:31.474
- ♪ BA-BA, BA-BA ♪

06:31.557 --> 06:34.477
♪ BA-BA, BA-BA ♪

06:34.560 --> 06:35.853
♪ HEY! ♪

06:35.937 --> 06:37.814
{\an8}- DONALD IS COUNCILMAN POWELL'S
DEBATE COACH.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.649
{\an8}I JUST SLEPT
WITH THE ENEMY.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.484
{\an8}- DID YOU GET
ANY SECRETS OUT OF HIM?

06:41.567 --> 06:44.862
{\an8}- NO, BUT I MAY HAVE
LET ONE OF OURS SLIP.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.490
{\an8}I MAY HAVE MENTIONED
THAT YOU SEEM A LITTLE CRAZY

06:47.573 --> 06:50.368
{\an8}NOW THAT YOU'RE TALKING
TO AN IMAGINARY CAMERA.

06:50.451 --> 06:55.123
{\an8}- YOU TALK ABOUT ELKA
WHILE YOU'RE HAVING SEX?

06:55.206 --> 06:57.834
{\an8}- YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOOD
AT DIRTY TALK.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.836
{\an8}- WELL, I FOUND OUT WHY
JJ'S BEEN NERVOUS

06:59.919 --> 07:01.504
{\an8}ABOUT BEING ALONE
WITH ME.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.131
{\an8}HE'S NEVER BEEN
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN

07:03.214 --> 07:04.632
{\an8}BESIDES HIS WIFE.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.217
{\an8}- REALLY.
ONLY HER?

07:06.300 --> 07:09.345
{\an8}- HE'S A ONE-GIN.
- A ONE-GIN?

07:09.428 --> 07:11.639
{\an8}- IT'S OUR TERM
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S ONE STEP AWAY

07:11.722 --> 07:13.850
{\an8}FROM BEING A VIRGIN.

07:13.933 --> 07:14.725
{\an8}- WE REALLY LIKE EACH OTHER,

07:14.809 --> 07:16.727
{\an8}SO IT'S REALLY JUST
A MATTER OF TIME

07:16.811 --> 07:20.314
{\an8}BEFORE I TAKE
HIS ONE-GINITY.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.692
{\an8}- I'M NOT SURE I COULD TAKE
THAT KIND OF PRESSURE,

07:22.775 --> 07:25.153
{\an8}FOLLOWING SOMEBODY
WHO WAS THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.738
{\an8}- OH, I HADN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.198
{\an8}- AND SHE DIED,

07:29.282 --> 07:30.867
{\an8}SO EVERYTHING ABOUT HER
BECOMES MORE HEIGHTENED

07:30.950 --> 07:33.661
{\an8}AND PERFECT
IN HIS MIND.

07:33.744 --> 07:37.165
{\an8}- THAT'S HOW I FEEL
ABOUT MY NIGHT WITH SINATRA.

07:37.248 --> 07:42.211
{\an8}WAIT, I <i> WANT</i> PEOPLE
TO KNOW ABOUT THAT.

07:42.295 --> 07:47.967
{\an8}THAT'S HOW I FEEL
ABOUT MY NIGHT WITH SINATRA.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.387
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT TO COMPETE
WITH HIS WIFE'S MEMORY.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.806
I JUST NEED TO PUT THAT
OUT OF MY MIND.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.559
- SO IF HE'S A ONE-GIN,

07:56.642 --> 08:01.606
WHAT DOES THAT MAKE YOU,
A 10,000-GIN?

08:01.689 --> 08:05.151
- I WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT
HOW MUCH GIN ONE OF US HAS HAD.

08:07.820 --> 08:11.157
- EVERY NOW AND THEN,
I LIKE TO GIVE HER A VICTORY.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.710
- WOW.

08:22.793 --> 08:27.298
I MEAN--WOW.

08:27.381 --> 08:31.344
GREAT NIGHT.
- LOVELY NIGHT.

08:31.427 --> 08:35.264
- SHOULD WE GO UPSTAIRS?
- WE COULD.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.933
- VICTORIA,
I KNOW THIS IS STRANGE,

08:37.015 --> 08:39.936
BUT I KEEP THINKING
MY LATE WIFE IS GONNA WALK IN

08:40.019 --> 08:41.604
AND CATCH ME
CHEATING ON HER.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.106
- AND I KEEP THINKING ABOUT
HOW MUCH YOU LOVED HER.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.775
AND YOU WROTE
THAT BEAUTIFUL MOVIE ABOUT HER,

08:45.858 --> 08:48.110
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW

08:48.194 --> 08:50.446
IF I COULD EVER BE
AS GOOD AS HER.

08:50.529 --> 08:52.073
- AND I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD EVER BE AS GOOD

08:52.156 --> 08:57.411
AS THOSE SEVEN OR EIGHT GUYS
YOU'VE BEEN WITH.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.205
I'M MORE SCARED NOW
THAN WHEN THEY DROPPED ME

08:59.288 --> 09:01.457
IN A RICE PADDY
IN 'NAM.

09:01.540 --> 09:04.627
- I HOPE THAT'S NOT AN EXAMPLE
OF YOUR PILLOW TALK.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.921
- [laughs]

09:07.004 --> 09:08.214
I SHOULD BE READY FOR THIS.

09:08.297 --> 09:11.259
I WENT TO CHURCH.
I LIT A CANDLE.

09:11.342 --> 09:14.428
- SEXY.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.472
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:16.555 --> 09:19.141
WE'RE BOTH PUTTING
TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON OURSELVES.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.768
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I MEAN, WE'RE ADULTS.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.228
WE CAN WAIT.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.980
WE'LL KNOW
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.399
- MM, AND WHEN THAT TIME COMES,

09:26.482 --> 09:31.612
I KNOW MY WIFE WILL BE
LOOKING DOWN ON US AND SMILING.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.323
- AGAIN, SEXY.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.329
- HOW DOES
THIS KEEP HAPPENING?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.873
I DON'T EVEN LIKE YOU.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.501
WE WERE JUST SUPPOSED TO DISCUSS
THE DEBATE GROUND RULES.

09:45.584 --> 09:46.669
- WELL, WE GET ANGRY
AT EACH OTHER,

09:46.752 --> 09:48.170
AND THE PASSION FLOWS.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.797
IT'S LIKE ACT THREE OF <i> TOSCA</i>

09:49.880 --> 09:51.841
WHERE PUCCINI
SO EXQUISITELY CAPTURES--

09:51.924 --> 09:55.136
- OH, MY GOD.
I DON'T CARE.

09:55.219 --> 09:57.346
CAN WE JUST GET BACK
TO THE DEBATE, OKAY?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.724
WHAT IS SO WRONG WITH USING JOY
AS THE MODERATOR?

09:59.807 --> 10:01.475
- MELANIE, COME ON.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.854
THAT IS SUCH AN OBVIOUS PLOY
IT'S ALMOST BENEATH YOU.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.689
WE NEED SOMEBODY IMPARTIAL

10:06.772 --> 10:10.109
WHO WON'T STEER THE CONVERSATION
TO BENEFIT YOUR CANDIDATE.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.197
- STOP BEING
SO DAMN STUBBORN!

10:15.281 --> 10:18.534
- I'M NOT TAKING CLOTHING ADVICE
FROM A LIMEY BONE BAG

10:18.617 --> 10:23.039
WHO SHOPS
AT SLUTS FIFTH AVENUE.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.876
- SAID THE GERIATRIC BOOZE BAG
WHO SHOPS AT FOREVER 91.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.672
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:31.756 --> 10:34.633
WE'RE FINE WITH JOY
AS THE MODERATOR.

10:34.717 --> 10:35.885
- GOOD EVENING, CLEVELAND.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.179
I'M REJOYLA SCROGGS,
YOUR MODERATOR.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.930
WELCOME
TO THE CITY COUNCIL DEBATE

10:40.014 --> 10:41.974
BETWEEN COUNCILMAN JIM POWELL

10:42.058 --> 10:44.101
AND CHALLENGER
ELKA OSTROVSKY.

10:44.185 --> 10:47.229
[applause]

10:48.606 --> 10:49.732
- WITH YOU HELPING HIM,

10:49.815 --> 10:51.233
HE'S GONNA SOUND LIKE
A POMPOUS WINDBAG.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.027
- WITH YOU HELPING HER,
SHE'S GONNA SOUND

10:53.110 --> 10:54.362
LIKE AN UNINFORMED BUBBLEHEAD.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.864
- I HAVE COLLECTED QUESTIONS
FROM THE AUDIENCE,

10:56.947 --> 10:59.283
AND TO THE GENTLEMAN
WHO ASKED FOR MY NUMBER,

10:59.367 --> 11:00.159
I'M FLATTERED

11:00.242 --> 11:03.579
BUT IN A RELATIONSHIP
AND VERY HAPPY.

11:03.662 --> 11:09.043
- IF YOU WANT HER NUMBER,
CHECK THE MEN'S ROOM WALL.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.920
- AND IF YOU WANT
ELKA'S NUMBER,

11:11.003 --> 11:13.631
CHECK THE WALL
OF KING TUT'S TOMB.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.387
NOW, LET'S START THE DEBATE

11:19.470 --> 11:22.098
WITH COUNCILMAN POWELL'S
OPENING STATEMENT.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.766
- I'M A DISABLED
AFRICAN-AMERICAN

11:23.849 --> 11:25.309
OHIO STATE FOOTBALL HERO,

11:25.393 --> 11:28.896
AND NO OFFENSE,
MY OPPONENT IS NOT.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.816
- YOU CAN'T RUN
ON JUST THAT.

11:31.899 --> 11:32.942
- THE PEOPLE
SEEM TO LIKE IT.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.777
KEPT ME OFFICE
FOR TEN YEARS.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.779
- WELL, THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE.

11:36.862 --> 11:40.783
YOU'RE GOING DOWN, POWELL.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.660
- WELL, THIS IS NICE.

11:42.743 --> 11:45.579
SUCH A RELIEF
NOT TO BE THINKING ABOUT SEX.

11:45.663 --> 11:48.999
- HUGE RELIEF.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.420
- I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING EROTIC
ABOUT A CITY COUNCIL DEBATE.

11:52.503 --> 11:57.508
- I COULDN'T BE LESS TURNED ON.

11:57.591 --> 12:00.302
- NOW, ELKA, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO MAKE YOUR OPENING STATEMENT?

12:00.386 --> 12:03.013
- MORE DOG PARKS.
VOTE ELKA.

12:03.097 --> 12:06.142
[applause]

12:07.893 --> 12:10.896
- SHADES OF WINSTON CHURCHILL.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.315
ON TO THE NEXT QUESTION.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.817
COUNCILMAN POWELL,

12:14.900 --> 12:17.319
STUDIES SHOW
THAT 20% OF LOCAL SEWER LINES

12:17.403 --> 12:19.321
FAIL TO MEET
MUNICIPAL STANDARDS.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.323
- 20% BELOW STANDARDS.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.992
NOW, THAT'S SOMETHING
WE WOULDN'T KNOW

12:23.075 --> 12:27.163
IF WE WERE OFF
HAVING SEX.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.165
- SO TRUE.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.250
THERE'S NO REASON
TO RUSH THINGS.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.505
NOW?
- NOW.

12:36.589 --> 12:40.384
- BUT WE'LL MISS THE DEBATE.
- I HAVE A RADIO IN MY CAR.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.677
- NEXT QUESTION.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.180
PEOPLE LIKE A CANDIDATE
THEY CAN RELATE TO.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.723
WHAT MAKES YOU
THE CANDIDATE

12:45.806 --> 12:47.558
THE PEOPLE WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE A DRINK WITH?

12:47.641 --> 12:52.563
- I WONDER
WHO PUT THAT ONE IN.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.983
- WELL, I'M JUST
AN OHIO STATE FOOTBALL HERO,

12:56.066 --> 12:57.651
AND FOR YOU LISTENERS
OUT THERE,

12:57.735 --> 13:00.738
MY OPPONENT
IS 92 YEARS OLD,

13:00.821 --> 13:02.323
NOT EXACTLY
THE TYPE OF PERSON

13:02.406 --> 13:03.991
YOU WANT TO KNOCK BACK
SOME COLD ONES WITH.

13:04.074 --> 13:07.203
AM I RIGHT?

13:07.286 --> 13:09.580
- I MIGHT TRY A DRINK.

13:09.663 --> 13:12.875
I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO SIP
A LITTLE SHERRY

13:12.958 --> 13:16.128
AT CHRISTMAS.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.089
- OH, NO.
ELKA CAN'T HOLD HER LIQUOR.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.717
SHE'LL GET DRUNK
AND EMBARRASS HERSELF.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.223
- WELL, SINCE THE VOTERS
HAVE SUGGESTED IT,

13:27.306 --> 13:28.724
WHY NOT HAVE A BEER
RIGHT NOW?

13:28.807 --> 13:32.186
- OR VODKA SHOTS.

13:32.269 --> 13:32.978
- SERIOUSLY?

13:33.062 --> 13:35.898
- IF THAT'S WHAT
THE PEOPLE WANT.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.400
[cheers and applause]

13:38.484 --> 13:42.321
- SET 'EM UP.
WE'RE DOING SHOTS.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.698
- IT'S ALMOST TOO EASY.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.745
- WHICH IS WHY I PROMISE

13:49.828 --> 13:52.748
TO FIND MORE MONEY
FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

13:52.831 --> 13:53.916
[chuckles]

13:53.999 --> 13:56.627
[applause]

14:00.673 --> 14:02.633
- COUNCILMAN POWELL,
YOUR REBUTTAL?

14:02.716 --> 14:05.302
- SHE SAID "BUTT."

14:08.347 --> 14:12.601
ACTUALLY MISS OSTROVSKY'S
LUDICROUS ASSERTION--

14:12.685 --> 14:14.603
- THAT SCHOOL VOUCHERS
COULD EVER BE TENABLE

14:14.687 --> 14:16.730
FOR THIS COMMUNITY IS NOTHING
MORE THAN A FLIGHT OF FANCY

14:16.814 --> 14:19.942
DOWN A CARROLLIAN
RABBIT HOLE.

14:20.025 --> 14:24.446
- SOMETHING, SOMETHING,
RABBIT HOLE.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.407
- WHAT THE HELL?

14:26.490 --> 14:30.995
- THANK YOU COUNCILMAN POWELL
FOR THAT ILLUMINATING RESPONSE.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.622
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU
KEEPING TRACK AT HOME,

14:33.706 --> 14:38.252
THAT'S SEVEN SHOTS OF VODKA
FOR BOTH CANDIDATES.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.963
I'D BE VERY SURPRISED
IF THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATERS

14:41.046 --> 14:42.590
ADOPTED THIS FORMAT.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.347
- THAT WAS AMAZING.
- YEAH, IT WAS, WASN'T IT?

14:50.431 --> 14:51.849
- I KIND OF LIKED
HAVING A STICK SHIFT

14:51.932 --> 14:54.184
POKING IN MY RIBS AGAIN.

14:54.268 --> 14:55.477
- YOU KNOW,
WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME

14:55.561 --> 14:57.104
TRYING TO BE ADULT
ABOUT EVERYTHING

14:57.187 --> 15:01.483
WHEN IT TURNS OUT WE JUST HAD
TO BE A COUPLE OF TEENAGERS.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.153
- ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

15:04.236 --> 15:07.489
- YES, LET'S GO BACK
TO MY PLACE

15:07.573 --> 15:10.159
AND ENJOY SOME SILK SHEETS
AND CHAMPAGNE.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.411
NOW WE CAN BE A COUPLE
OF TEENAGERS WITH MONEY.

15:16.915 --> 15:19.501
- ACTUALLY MY RESPONSE
TO YOUR THOUGHT-PROVOKING QUERY

15:19.585 --> 15:21.378
MIGHT JUST SURPRISE YOU.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.505
- THERE YOU ARE, DONALD.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.506
- MELANIE.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.508
- YOU LOOK SO SEXY

15:26.592 --> 15:30.846
I DON'T THINK
I CAN KEEP MY HANDS OFF YOU.

15:30.929 --> 15:33.390
- OH.
THAT FEELS GOOD.

15:33.474 --> 15:36.143
- OH, THAT FEELS GOOD.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.315
DON'T STOP.

15:41.398 --> 15:45.152
WAIT UNTIL I GET YOU HOME,
YOU DIRTY LITTLE GIRL.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.866
- COUNCILMAN POWELL?
COUNCILMAN POWELL?

15:50.949 --> 15:55.204
- I TOLD YOU
HE WAS GOING DOWN.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.538
- UNFORTUNATELY
COUNCILMAN POWELL

15:56.622 --> 15:57.373
HAS FALLEN ILL.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.375
I'M SURE
HE WOULD WANT TO REMIND YOU

15:59.458 --> 16:01.251
THAT HE IS A DISABLED
AFRICAN-AMERICAN

16:01.335 --> 16:05.005
OHIO STATE
FOOTBALL HERO.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.174
- WELL, SEEING AS WE ONLY HAVE
ONE CANDIDATE

16:07.257 --> 16:08.592
WHO IS STILL CONSCIOUS,

16:08.676 --> 16:10.886
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE DEBATE IS OVER,

16:10.969 --> 16:13.097
SO BY DEFAULT--

16:13.180 --> 16:16.892
- NOT SO FAST,
<i>DOWNTON ABBEY.</i>

16:16.975 --> 16:18.686
- WHO ARE YOU?

16:18.769 --> 16:22.064
- I AM COUNCILMAN POWELL'S
AUNT ESTHER JEAN JOHNSON.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.734
I WILL TAKE HIS PLACE.
- SHE CAN'T DO THAT.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.905
- ACTUALLY, SUBCLAUSE 8.3
ALLOWS FOR SUBSTITUTIONS.

16:29.988 --> 16:32.282
I'VE READ THE BYLAWS.

16:32.366 --> 16:36.036
- "I'VE READ THE BYLAWS."

16:37.162 --> 16:39.081
- ALL RIGHT.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.750
COUNCILMAN POWELL,
WHEN YOU WERE ELECTED,

16:41.834 --> 16:45.045
YOU PROMISED TO PUT LIGHTS UP
IN THE PARK BASEBALL FIELDS.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.964
WHY HASN'T THAT HAPPENED?
- WHAT?

16:47.047 --> 16:50.092
I TOLD HIM TO DO THAT.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.386
I ALSO TOLD HIM
TO GO TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY,

16:52.469 --> 16:55.139
BUT HE DIDN'T DO THAT EITHER.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.266
OH, THAT BOY GETS ME RILED.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.767
- RIGHT, NEXT QUESTION.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.437
- YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM
IS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.440
IS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
HARD WORK.

17:04.522 --> 17:07.276
THEY ASK, "HOW MUCH DO I GET
TO MOW THE LAWN?"

17:07.358 --> 17:12.906
AND THEN I ASK, "WELL, WHAT DO
I GET FOR NOT WHUPPING YOU?"

17:12.990 --> 17:15.951
- PREACHING TO THE CHOIR.

17:16.034 --> 17:19.288
- AND DON'T GET ME STARTED
ON YOUNG MEN IN COFFEE SHOPS

17:19.371 --> 17:22.583
ORDERING THEM
NONFAT DECAF SOY LATTES.

17:22.665 --> 17:27.087
COWBOY UP
AND ORDER SOME MILK.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.673
- IS THAT REALLY
A PRESSING PROBLEM?

17:29.757 --> 17:32.217
- WELL, WHO ASKED YOU,
SKINNY-ASS MARY POPPINS?

17:34.261 --> 17:37.639
- THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.142
- AND WHAT ABOUT MEN
WHO SAY THEY'LL CALL YOU

17:40.225 --> 17:41.477
BUT THEY DON'T?

17:41.560 --> 17:45.606
- THEY WILL
IF I'M ELECTED.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.983
- I LIKE YOUR STYLE,
HONEY CHILD.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.527
BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE TO RUN
AGAINST MY NEPHEW?

17:50.611 --> 17:52.154
CAN'T YOU RUN
AGAINST SOMEONE ELSE?

17:52.237 --> 17:55.199
- YOUR NEPHEW WANTS TO CLOSE
ALL THE DOG PARKS.

17:55.282 --> 17:59.912
- WHAT?
OH, HELL NO.

17:59.995 --> 18:03.624
I TAKE MY DOGS TO THE PARK
EVERY DAY.

18:03.707 --> 18:06.001
NOW, WHERE ARE BLING
AND TEDDY PENDERGRASS

18:06.085 --> 18:07.711
SUPPOSED TO DO
THEIR BUSINESS?

18:07.795 --> 18:10.464
- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

18:10.547 --> 18:14.468
- EVERYBODY,
I AM CHANGING MY VOTE.

18:14.551 --> 18:17.805
COUNCILMAN POWELL'S
BEYONCE LOOK-ALIKE AUNT--

18:17.888 --> 18:20.015
- WHAT?
- IT'LL BE ON THE RADIO.

18:20.098 --> 18:21.892
THEY CAN'T SEE.

18:21.975 --> 18:25.854
ANYWAY, I'M SUPPORTING ELKA,
AND YOU SHOULD TOO.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.817
[cheers and applause]

18:29.900 --> 18:32.194
NOW, STAND UP
AND GIVE ME A HUG.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.696
- I AM STANDING UP.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.324
- OH, WELL,
THEN JUST GIVE ME SOME SUGAR.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.951
OUT OF MY WAY,
LONDON BRIDGE.

18:43.121 --> 18:46.667
[applause]

18:46.750 --> 18:49.670
- AND THAT'S
HOW YOU DO POLITICS.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.385
- CONGRATULATIONS, ELKA.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.720
YOU FIRED UP
THE CRANKY OLD LADY VOTE.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.222
THERE'S GONNA BE
A LOT OF CARS

19:00.305 --> 19:04.268
DRIVING VERY SLOWLY
TO THE POLLS.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.061
- I'M NO HERO.

19:06.144 --> 19:11.108
I'M JUST A 92-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
WHO HAD 10 SHOTS OF VODKA.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.235
- AND CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU,
VICTORIA.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.654
YOU AND JJ
FINALLY GOT TOGETHER.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.197
- I'M NO HERO.

19:17.281 --> 19:22.119
I'M JUST A 10-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
WHO HAD 92 SHOTS OF VODKA.

19:28.166 --> 19:31.295
- YOU KNOW, YOU TRY TO BE
SO CAREFUL AND MATURE,

19:31.378 --> 19:32.713
BUT SOMETIMES
YOU JUST HAVE TO DO

19:32.796 --> 19:36.717
WHAT COMES NATURALLY
AND REPEATEDLY.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.218
- YOU REALLY LIKE HIM,
DON'T YOU?

19:38.302 --> 19:39.761
- I DO.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.096
YEAH, I THINK
WE WERE BOTH JUST AFRAID

19:41.179 --> 19:42.598
BECAUSE WE SEE A FUTURE IN THIS,

19:42.681 --> 19:44.725
AND WE DON'T
WANT TO MAKE A MISTAKE.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.602
- WELL, MAYBE I'M SO AFRAID
OF MAKING A MISTAKE

19:46.685 --> 19:49.605
THAT I'M CHOOSING MEN
I HAVE NO FUTURE WITH.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.274
I JUST WANT TO WAKE UP
WITH SOMEONE I CAN STAND.

19:52.357 --> 19:55.736
- I HAVE THAT WITH MITCH.
I'M GONNA CALL HIM.

19:55.819 --> 19:57.446
- YEAH, I'M GONNA CALL JJ.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.448
- I'M GONNA CALL DONALD.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.951
DONALD!
- YES, MILADY.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.954
- HE'S HERE?
- YEAH, HE'S UPSTAIRS.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.833
I'LL CHOOSE A MAN
I HAVE A FUTURE WITH TOMORROW.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.128
- WITH APOLOGIES TO THE BARD,
PRAY BORROW CUPID'S WINGS,

20:13.211 --> 20:15.797
SOAR WITH THEM ABOVE
TO THIS OUR COMMON BED.

20:15.881 --> 20:20.302
- [sighs]
HE'S SUCH A SCHMUCK.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.929
COMING!

20:22.012 --> 20:24.306
- SO SHOULD
WE CALL IT A NIGHT?

20:24.389 --> 20:26.183
- I'M NO HERO.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.477
I'M JUST A 92-YEAR-OLD VODKA

20:28.560 --> 20:32.522
WHO'S HAD 10 SHOTS
OF WOMEN.
