WEBVTT

00:07.883 --> 00:10.255
[blows]

00:11.723 --> 00:13.528
(Ryan)
Yeah, I'm not a temp anymore.

00:13.560 --> 00:15.399
I got Jim's, uh, old job.

00:15.432 --> 00:17.569
Which means, at my ten-year
high school reunion,

00:17.603 --> 00:20.142
it will not say,
"Ryan Howard is a temp."

00:20.174 --> 00:23.215
It will say, "Ryan Howard
is a junior sales associate

00:23.247 --> 00:25.751
at a mid-range
paper supply firm."

00:25.785 --> 00:28.190
That'll show 'em.

00:45.259 --> 00:47.229
You have no idea

00:47.263 --> 00:49.733
how long I've wanted
to do that.

00:49.767 --> 00:51.604
Me too.

00:54.342 --> 00:56.346
I think we're just drunk.

00:56.381 --> 00:57.783
No, I'm not drunk.

00:57.816 --> 00:59.787
Are you drunk?

00:59.820 --> 01:01.724
No.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.133
Jim.

01:08.770 --> 01:10.908
You're really
gonna marry him?

01:13.215 --> 01:15.552
Okay.

01:22.533 --> 01:24.737
[pretending to cry]
Jim is gone.

01:24.770 --> 01:28.444
He's gone.
I miss him so much.

01:28.478 --> 01:31.751
Oh, I cry myself to sleep.
Jim.

01:31.784 --> 01:34.723
False.
I do not miss him.

01:34.757 --> 01:37.729
[upbeat piano music]

01:37.763 --> 01:45.779
*

02:06.920 --> 02:08.758
No, that is the fun
of this place.

02:08.790 --> 02:10.528
I call everybody "faggy."

02:10.562 --> 02:12.064
Why would anyone
find that offensive?

02:12.097 --> 02:13.835
Okay, I think Oscar would
just like if you used "lame"

02:13.867 --> 02:14.837
or something like that.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.307
That's what "faggy" means!

02:16.341 --> 02:18.042
No, not really.
[Michael groans]

02:18.076 --> 02:20.782
Apparently you
called Oscar faggy.

02:20.815 --> 02:22.319
Yeah.

02:22.353 --> 02:23.788
For liking the movie
Shakespeare in Love

02:23.821 --> 02:25.392
more than an action movie.

02:25.424 --> 02:27.596
It wasn't just an action movie,
it was Die Hard.

02:27.628 --> 02:29.699
All right, Michael,
but Oscar's really gay.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.337
Exactly.
I mean for real.

02:31.371 --> 02:32.439
Yeah, I know.

02:32.473 --> 02:34.107
No, he's attracted
to other men.

02:34.140 --> 02:36.981
Okay, little too far.
Crossed the line.

02:37.014 --> 02:41.857
Okay, I am telling you,
Oscar is an actual homosexual.

02:45.162 --> 02:47.568
He told me this morning.

02:47.603 --> 02:50.574
And obviously he hopes he can
count on your discretion.

02:50.609 --> 02:52.812
I would've never called him that
if I knew.

02:52.846 --> 02:53.680
You don't...

02:53.714 --> 02:56.653
you don't call
retarded people retards.

02:56.686 --> 02:58.525
It's bad taste.

02:58.558 --> 03:01.931
You call your friends retards
when they're acting retarded.

03:01.964 --> 03:06.104
And I consider Oscar a friend.

03:06.139 --> 03:08.410
Listen, man,
I am so sorry.

03:08.445 --> 03:09.613
I had no idea.

03:09.646 --> 03:11.650
Oh, it's fine.

03:11.684 --> 03:13.052
It's okay, it's okay.
No, no, it's not.

03:13.085 --> 03:14.656
I just--
I feel terrible about it.

03:14.690 --> 03:15.759
I...

03:15.792 --> 03:18.063
I have been
calling people faggy

03:18.095 --> 03:19.732
since I was in junior high,

03:19.767 --> 03:21.637
and I have never
made this mistake.

03:21.670 --> 03:24.643
If I don't know
how to behave,

03:24.676 --> 03:29.151
it is because I am
just so far the opposite way.

03:29.184 --> 03:30.955
You know?
I'm just--

03:30.989 --> 03:34.061
I-I can't even imagine--
the...thing.

03:34.095 --> 03:37.735
Maybe we could go out
for a beer sometime,

03:37.768 --> 03:39.707
and you could tell me...

03:39.739 --> 03:42.546
how you do that
to another dude.

03:44.550 --> 03:47.523
That sounds like
a great, wonderful idea.

03:47.556 --> 03:48.824
Let's do that.

04:02.918 --> 04:05.924
[giggling]

04:07.328 --> 04:10.067
It explains so much.

04:10.099 --> 04:12.237
No, I'm not gay.

04:12.271 --> 04:13.940
And I don't understand

04:13.975 --> 04:18.984
why anyone would think
that I'm gay if...

04:19.018 --> 04:22.024
[sighs]

04:24.261 --> 04:25.864
Uh...

04:27.735 --> 04:29.170
Yeah, I'm gay.

04:29.205 --> 04:32.044
[giggling]

04:32.077 --> 04:34.717
I can't say whether
Dunder Mifflin paper

04:34.750 --> 04:37.756
is less flammable, sir,
but I can assure you

04:37.788 --> 04:39.627
that it is certainly
not more flammable.

04:39.660 --> 04:41.764
Why did I transfer
to Stamford?

04:41.796 --> 04:44.837
I...think that's
pretty obvious.

04:44.869 --> 04:47.374
I got promoted.

04:47.407 --> 04:49.278
And you can't beat that view.

04:49.311 --> 04:50.380
Right?

04:50.413 --> 04:52.384
Hey, Big Tuna.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.356
You're single, right?

04:54.388 --> 04:56.125
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I am.

04:58.229 --> 05:00.601
Pretty hot, huh?

05:02.806 --> 05:04.743
She's completely crazy.

05:04.776 --> 05:07.749
[small laugh]

05:07.782 --> 05:09.118
Steer clear,
Big Tuna.

05:09.150 --> 05:11.189
Head for open waters.

05:12.223 --> 05:13.760
Okay.

05:13.794 --> 05:15.197
Okay.

05:17.936 --> 05:20.407
(Jim)
I ate a tuna sandwich
on my first day,

05:20.441 --> 05:22.276
so Andy started calling me
Big Tuna.

05:24.849 --> 05:28.156
I don't think any of them
actually know my real name.

05:28.189 --> 05:31.731
Big Tuna is a super ambitious
guy, you know?

05:31.764 --> 05:33.266
Cut-your-throat-to-get-ahead
type of guy.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.805
But, I mean,
I'm not threatened by him.

05:35.839 --> 05:37.908
I went to Cornell.

05:37.943 --> 05:40.247
You ever heard of it?

05:40.280 --> 05:42.385
I graduated in four years,
I never studied once,

05:42.417 --> 05:44.087
I was drunk
the whole time,

05:44.120 --> 05:46.393
and I sang in
the a capella group,

05:46.425 --> 05:49.265
"Here Comes Treble."

05:49.298 --> 05:51.971
So, end of day,
we are going to have

05:52.003 --> 05:54.140
a little diversity
policy freshener,

05:54.174 --> 05:56.847
because of some more problems
at the Scranton branch.

05:56.881 --> 05:59.351
And I have a list
of business startups

05:59.386 --> 06:00.721
I got from the Chamber.

06:00.721 --> 06:01.857
[employees groan]
Yes.

06:01.891 --> 06:04.228
I am going to need someone
to cold call them.

06:04.260 --> 06:05.898
Oh, I can do that.

06:07.301 --> 06:08.904
Jim's nice enough.

06:08.937 --> 06:11.843
I don't--I don't know
how well he's fitting in here.

06:11.876 --> 06:15.985
He's always looking
at the camera like this.

06:17.989 --> 06:19.391
What is that?

06:19.426 --> 06:21.194
Can you tell who's gay
and who's not?

06:21.228 --> 06:22.230
Of course.

06:22.264 --> 06:23.366
What about Oscar?

06:23.399 --> 06:25.137
Absolutely not.

06:25.169 --> 06:27.274
Well, he is.

06:28.977 --> 06:32.151
Well, he's not dressed
in women's clothes, so...

06:32.183 --> 06:33.420
[Michael sighs deeply]

06:33.454 --> 06:34.890
There could be others.

06:34.923 --> 06:36.158
I need to know.

06:36.191 --> 06:38.363
I don't want to offend
anybody else.

06:38.396 --> 06:40.266
You could assume
everyone is,

06:40.300 --> 06:43.073
and not say anything
offensive.

06:43.105 --> 06:44.274
Yeah.

06:44.308 --> 06:45.543
I'm sure everyone
would appreciate

06:45.578 --> 06:47.482
me treating them
like they were gay.

06:50.553 --> 06:52.024
Hey, what about Angela?

06:52.056 --> 06:53.427
She's hard and severe.

06:53.460 --> 06:54.628
She could be
a gay woman.

06:54.661 --> 06:57.133
I really don't think so.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.268
I don't know.

06:58.302 --> 07:00.239
I can imagine her
with another woman.

07:00.272 --> 07:02.011
Can't you?

07:05.450 --> 07:06.652
Do some research.

07:06.686 --> 07:08.288
Find out if there's
a way to tell

07:08.322 --> 07:09.225
by just looking at 'em.

07:09.258 --> 07:12.965
Jim told me you could
buy gaydar online.

07:12.998 --> 07:14.568
That's ridiculous.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.172
Yeah, probably.

07:16.205 --> 07:18.176
He didn't
tell the truth a lot.

07:20.146 --> 07:21.382
Let's call him
and get the website.

07:21.415 --> 07:22.452
Definitely.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.220
What's gaydar?

07:24.255 --> 07:25.657
Oh, oh, gaydar, yes!

07:25.691 --> 07:28.464
No, uh, I think they have it
at Sharper Image.

07:28.497 --> 07:30.701
Oh, you know what?
I can check for you.

07:30.733 --> 07:32.236
No problem.

07:32.271 --> 07:34.476
[bangs keys loudly]

07:36.079 --> 07:37.380
It's sold out.

07:38.617 --> 07:41.321
Yeah, sorry about that.
That's a bummer.

07:41.354 --> 07:43.459
Well, they're sold out.

07:43.494 --> 07:44.596
Damn.

07:44.629 --> 07:46.231
I'll try Brookstone.

07:51.341 --> 07:53.046
I miss that.

07:55.349 --> 07:56.720
[door opens]

08:02.296 --> 08:04.468
Chicken or fish?

08:04.501 --> 08:06.673
Uh...chicken.

08:10.613 --> 08:12.317
So, you, uh,
having a good day?

08:12.351 --> 08:14.187
Excellent.
Thanks.

08:14.221 --> 08:16.592
Good.
I'm glad.

08:18.696 --> 08:20.633
Okay.

08:24.308 --> 08:26.546
(Pam)
Yeah, I didn't go through
with the wedding.

08:26.580 --> 08:29.251
I got cold feet
a few days before,

08:29.284 --> 08:31.389
and...
I can't really explain it.

08:31.421 --> 08:33.794
I just had to get out
of that relationship.

08:33.826 --> 08:36.232
We still had to pay
for all the food.

08:36.264 --> 08:37.735
So we froze it.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.741
But I'm...I'm doing well.

08:40.773 --> 08:42.578
I have my own apartment,

08:42.612 --> 08:44.749
and I'm taking art classes,

08:44.781 --> 08:48.156
and I have lunch
for the next five weeks.

08:48.189 --> 08:51.229
After Pam dumped me,
I, um...

08:51.262 --> 08:54.101
I kinda stopped taking care
of myself for a while there,

08:54.135 --> 08:55.502
and, uh...

08:55.537 --> 08:57.541
I hit bottom when, uh...

08:57.575 --> 08:59.178
I had a drunk driving arrest.

09:01.081 --> 09:03.687
I've been working out,
and, um...

09:03.720 --> 09:06.692
you know, I'm not
gonna take her for granted.

09:11.836 --> 09:15.242
I gotta win her back.

09:15.276 --> 09:16.913
I got them a toaster.

09:16.946 --> 09:20.319
They called off the wedding
and gave the toaster back to me.

09:20.353 --> 09:22.891
I tried to return the toaster
to the store,

09:22.925 --> 09:25.763
and they said they no longer
sold that kind of toaster.

09:25.798 --> 09:29.171
So now my house
has got two toasters.

09:32.977 --> 09:35.950
It is so cool
that you're gay.

09:35.983 --> 09:38.155
I totally underestimated you.

09:39.958 --> 09:42.264
Yes, I am super cool.

09:42.297 --> 09:43.934
I am an accountant

09:43.966 --> 09:46.740
at a failing
paper supply company.

09:46.773 --> 09:48.443
In Scranton.

09:48.475 --> 09:51.915
Much like, uh,
Sir Ian McKellen.

09:55.891 --> 09:58.263
(Angela)
Sure, sometimes I watch
Will & Grace.

09:58.296 --> 09:59.998
And I want to throw up.

10:00.031 --> 10:02.536
It's terribly loud.

10:02.571 --> 10:06.879
I do like it sometimes,
when Harry Connick Jr. is on.

10:06.913 --> 10:09.619
He's so talented.

10:25.550 --> 10:27.386
Okay.

10:27.421 --> 10:29.759
Who put my calculator
in Jell-O?

10:33.466 --> 10:34.769
(Andy)
Good one.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.573
But, uh, seriously.

10:37.606 --> 10:40.347
Guys, who did this?

10:41.950 --> 10:44.620
Seriously, guys.

10:44.655 --> 10:46.624
Who did this?

10:47.761 --> 10:48.997
I need to know

10:49.029 --> 10:51.569
who put my calculator
in Jell-O

10:51.601 --> 10:54.976
or I'm gonna lose
my freakin' mind!

11:03.827 --> 11:07.065
(Jan)
You know, it's amazing to me
that in this day and age,

11:07.100 --> 11:09.739
you could be so...obtuse

11:09.771 --> 11:11.575
about sexual orientation.

11:11.608 --> 11:13.646
I watch The L Word, okay?

11:13.680 --> 11:14.716
Good, good.

11:14.749 --> 11:16.952
I watch Queer as [bleep].

11:16.985 --> 11:18.088
So...
That's not
what it's called.

11:18.121 --> 11:19.490
(Toby)
Okay, Michael,

11:19.525 --> 11:21.094
are you aware
that you outed Oscar today?

11:21.127 --> 11:23.734
What?
What does that even--

11:23.766 --> 11:26.705
Coming out
is a significant moment

11:26.740 --> 11:27.774
for a gay person.

11:27.807 --> 11:28.776
And they should be allowed

11:28.809 --> 11:31.549
to select the timing
and manner of announcing it.

11:31.581 --> 11:33.453
Well, gay pride, right?

11:33.486 --> 11:35.423
Gay pride parade?

11:35.457 --> 11:38.162
It's not like...
Gay Shame Festival.

11:38.194 --> 11:41.903
All right, now Oscar's feeling
discriminated against

11:41.936 --> 11:43.974
by his coworkers,
primarily Angela,

11:44.007 --> 11:45.109
and, um...

11:45.141 --> 11:46.210
That's your fault.

11:46.243 --> 11:48.516
I think Angela
might be gay.

11:48.549 --> 11:49.650
Could Oscar and Angela

11:49.685 --> 11:50.921
be having a gay affair?

11:50.954 --> 11:52.123
(Jan)
No--
Maybe.

11:52.155 --> 11:53.893
Is that what
this is about?
No.

11:53.927 --> 11:54.962
I don't--

11:54.996 --> 11:56.230
No.
It's not possible.

11:56.263 --> 11:58.002
Anything's possible.

11:58.035 --> 12:00.840
Okay, you know, imagine...
you were gay.

12:00.873 --> 12:01.441
[laughs]

12:01.441 --> 12:04.614
Well, I'm not gay, Jan,

12:04.648 --> 12:06.719
and you should know that
better than anybody.

12:06.752 --> 12:07.955
Michael.
Hmm?

12:07.988 --> 12:11.628
Your immaturity
is extremely disappointing

12:11.661 --> 12:13.131
and may even lead
to a lawsuit,

12:13.164 --> 12:15.537
which is the absolute
last thing this company needs

12:15.569 --> 12:16.806
right now,
do you understand?

12:16.840 --> 12:17.807
I know.

12:17.842 --> 12:21.614
The company has made it
my responsibility today

12:21.649 --> 12:24.287
to put an end
to 100,000 years

12:24.319 --> 12:27.293
of being weirded out
by gays.

12:27.325 --> 12:29.665
Am I the first gay man
you ever knew?

12:29.697 --> 12:31.769
Trick question.

12:31.803 --> 12:33.906
Because you can't
always tell,

12:33.939 --> 12:35.677
so how would I know?

12:35.710 --> 12:37.914
Was that the right answer?

12:37.947 --> 12:39.184
[knocking on door]

12:39.217 --> 12:40.920
Yep?
Michael...

12:40.953 --> 12:43.257
Dwight's looking at gay
pornography on his computer.

12:43.292 --> 12:44.796
Uh, Michael knows, Pam.

12:44.828 --> 12:46.832
Okay, he asked me to do this
just for him.

12:46.865 --> 12:48.804
He has his own reasons.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.975
[Michael sighs]

12:52.009 --> 12:54.648
Phew, okay.

12:54.681 --> 12:56.785
Nothing wrong with this stuff.

12:56.820 --> 12:58.824
At all.
This is fine.

12:58.856 --> 12:59.958
You know what?

12:59.991 --> 13:03.065
Gay porn, straight porn,
it's all good.

13:03.097 --> 13:04.936
I don't particularly
get into this,

13:04.968 --> 13:06.772
but, uh...

13:06.805 --> 13:08.007
You know what?

13:08.041 --> 13:09.812
I totally see the merit.

13:09.845 --> 13:11.748
And, actually...

13:11.781 --> 13:13.820
It is quite beautiful.

13:13.853 --> 13:15.824
Oh, damn popups.
What are you doing?

13:15.857 --> 13:17.694
Watching some
of your friends.

13:17.726 --> 13:18.929
This is stupid.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.231
Excuse me.
Don't touch me.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.935
Help! Ow.

13:21.970 --> 13:23.974
[Dwight screams]
Whoa, whoa, whoa--

13:24.006 --> 13:25.409
Whoa, whoa.
Stop it.

13:25.441 --> 13:27.113
All right, everybody
in the conference room.

13:27.146 --> 13:28.282
[shouting]
I don't care

13:28.314 --> 13:32.824
if you are gay or straight
or a lesbian, or overweight.

13:32.858 --> 13:34.861
Just get in here!
Right now!

13:36.198 --> 13:37.300
Did you know that "gay"

13:37.333 --> 13:39.938
used to mean "happy"?

13:39.971 --> 13:42.711
When I was growing up,
it meant "lame."

13:42.744 --> 13:46.184
And now,
it means a man

13:46.218 --> 13:50.827
who makes love
to other men.

13:50.861 --> 13:51.995
We're all homos.

13:52.029 --> 13:53.165
Homo sapiens.

13:53.198 --> 13:55.737
Gays aren't necessarily
who you think they are, people.

13:55.770 --> 13:56.873
What?

13:56.905 --> 13:58.909
I mean, anybody
can be gay.

13:58.944 --> 14:00.312
Businessmen.

14:00.346 --> 14:01.681
Like antique dealers,

14:01.681 --> 14:04.821
or hairdressers,

14:04.855 --> 14:07.292
or...accountants.

14:07.326 --> 14:09.797
Oscar, why don't you

14:09.830 --> 14:12.335
take this opportunity
to officially come out

14:12.369 --> 14:14.139
to everybody here,

14:14.174 --> 14:15.809
however you want to do it.

14:17.245 --> 14:18.848
Go ahead.

14:18.884 --> 14:20.519
Stand up.

14:20.551 --> 14:22.390
I'm doing this for you.

14:25.229 --> 14:26.363
Yes, I'm gay.

14:26.398 --> 14:27.968
And...

14:28.001 --> 14:30.539
I didn't plan on sharing
that part of my life

14:30.571 --> 14:34.247
with you today, so...
whatever.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.516
Can I sit down now?

14:35.548 --> 14:38.388
(Creed)
I am not offended
by homosexuality.

14:38.422 --> 14:42.095
In the '60s, I made love
to many, many women.

14:42.129 --> 14:43.934
Often outdoors.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.070
In the mud and the rain.

14:46.103 --> 14:49.009
And it's possible
a man slipped in.

14:49.044 --> 14:51.048
There would be no way
of knowing.

14:51.080 --> 14:54.956
Who should be
the judges and juries

14:54.989 --> 14:56.058
of our society?

14:56.090 --> 14:57.460
Judges and juries.

14:57.493 --> 15:00.332
Yes, that's a good point.
She has a good point.

15:00.366 --> 15:02.870
Because gay marriage,
currently,

15:02.905 --> 15:05.475
is not legal
under U.S. law.

15:05.509 --> 15:07.346
I bet a lot
of straight men

15:07.380 --> 15:09.416
wish that applied to them.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.022
So they could go out there
and have some

15:12.056 --> 15:13.959
torrid, unabashed,
monkey sex.

15:13.993 --> 15:15.229
As much as they could.

15:15.261 --> 15:17.265
You know,
sounds pretty good, right?

15:17.300 --> 15:18.502
That sounds great.

15:18.534 --> 15:20.339
Yeah, Dwight?

15:20.372 --> 15:22.510
I think all
the other office gays

15:22.542 --> 15:25.181
should identify themselves,
or I will do it for them.

15:25.216 --> 15:26.985
No one else in this office
is gay.

15:27.020 --> 15:27.987
What about Phyllis?

15:28.022 --> 15:30.558
She makes absolutely
no attempt to be feminine.

15:30.592 --> 15:33.032
I'm getting married
to Bob Vance.

15:33.064 --> 15:34.500
(Stanley)
You are?

15:34.534 --> 15:36.103
(all)
Congratulations.

15:36.138 --> 15:37.440
When did you get that?

15:37.473 --> 15:38.375
(Michael)
That's great.

15:38.408 --> 15:40.512
Congratulations, Phyllis.
That is great.

15:40.546 --> 15:42.483
And frankly,
kind of amazing.

15:42.516 --> 15:43.585
[laughs]

15:43.617 --> 15:45.321
See? Everybody has a chance.

15:45.355 --> 15:46.623
Thank you.
But still,

15:46.658 --> 15:48.062
Phyllis...

15:48.095 --> 15:49.597
In college,

15:49.629 --> 15:52.269
did you ever experiment
with other women?

15:52.302 --> 15:53.605
A lot of women do.

15:53.637 --> 15:55.943
No, and you knew me
in high school.

15:55.978 --> 15:58.615
Of course, we all thought
you were gay in high school.

15:58.647 --> 16:01.153
[laughs]
Right.

16:01.188 --> 16:03.324
Ha, ha!

16:05.029 --> 16:07.032
And I take that
as a compliment.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.270
Well, with your ties
and your matching socks--

16:09.304 --> 16:11.408
Well, I just liked
to look good, okay, so--

16:11.441 --> 16:12.642
You sound pretty defensive,
Michael.

16:12.676 --> 16:13.611
No, I am just

16:13.644 --> 16:15.316
coming out myself.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.751
I am coming out hetero.

16:16.784 --> 16:18.622
I think the problem
with this office

16:18.654 --> 16:20.626
is that you
are sending mixed signals

16:20.658 --> 16:21.761
about my being here.

16:21.793 --> 16:23.065
No, no. No.

16:23.097 --> 16:25.101
The only signal
that I am sending is,

16:25.136 --> 16:26.437
"Gay good."

16:26.471 --> 16:29.477
Look, if I was gay,

16:29.510 --> 16:35.189
I would be the most flamboyant
gay you've ever seen.

16:35.221 --> 16:38.128
I would be leading the parade
covered in feathers,

16:38.162 --> 16:39.664
and just...

16:39.697 --> 16:41.400
I'd be waving
that rainbow flag.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.505
[giggling]

16:43.538 --> 16:45.676
I don't think
I can work here any longer.

16:45.709 --> 16:51.221
This has been the worst,
most backwards day of my life.

16:51.253 --> 16:52.455
You misunderstand--okay.
All right.

16:52.489 --> 16:53.658
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bop.

16:53.692 --> 16:55.662
You know what?
Okay. Okay.

16:55.696 --> 16:58.467
I, uh...I'm gonna put my money
where my mouth is.

16:58.501 --> 16:59.804
You ready?

16:59.836 --> 17:01.074
What are you doing?

17:01.108 --> 17:02.042
I am going to embrace Oscar.

17:02.042 --> 17:03.478
You might want
to watch this, Angela,

17:03.512 --> 17:05.348
because you can't
catch anything.

17:05.382 --> 17:06.684
Here we go.
(Oscar)
No.

17:06.717 --> 17:07.719
We are going
to make a statement.

17:07.753 --> 17:10.658
You and I are going
to make a statement together.

17:10.691 --> 17:12.662
Oscar is my friend.
I'd rather not.

17:12.695 --> 17:14.699
And I just don't care
who sees it.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.170
Doesn't bother me.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.573
I really would--would--
I'd really rather not.

17:17.605 --> 17:19.144
Come here, friend.
You're my friend.

17:19.177 --> 17:20.778
[screaming]
No, no!

17:20.812 --> 17:22.482
I don't want to touch you.

17:22.515 --> 17:23.851
Ever considered that?

17:23.885 --> 17:25.822
You're ignorant.

17:25.855 --> 17:27.460
And insulting.
And small.

17:29.197 --> 17:30.766
Okay.

17:35.376 --> 17:37.246
All right.

17:39.849 --> 17:41.288
Um...

17:41.321 --> 17:42.589
I'm sorry, Michael.

17:42.623 --> 17:44.660
Michael.
I'm sorry.

17:46.631 --> 17:48.534
That was a good idea.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.603
Come on.

17:49.637 --> 17:51.341
Come on.

17:51.373 --> 17:53.912
All right.

17:53.944 --> 17:56.851
[crying]
I'm sorry
I called you "faggy."

17:56.883 --> 17:59.456
I know, I know.
I know you are.
You're not faggy.

17:59.489 --> 18:00.926
You're a good guy.
You too.

18:00.958 --> 18:03.931
(Dwight)
Michael appears
to be gay too.

18:03.965 --> 18:07.373
And yet, he is my friend.

18:07.405 --> 18:09.909
I guess I do have
a gay friend.

18:09.944 --> 18:12.815
You know what?
I'm gonna raise the stakes.

18:12.849 --> 18:14.487
You don't...
really don't...

18:14.520 --> 18:15.955
I want you
to watch this.

18:15.989 --> 18:19.764
And I want you to burn this
into your brains.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.904
I don't think we need to--
Because this is an image

18:23.938 --> 18:26.543
that I want you people
to remember.

18:26.578 --> 18:28.882
For a long time to come.

18:28.914 --> 18:30.519
Whenever you come
into the office,

18:30.551 --> 18:32.523
I want you to think
about this.

18:32.555 --> 18:34.494
We don't need to--

18:34.526 --> 18:35.695
Yes, we do.
What?

18:44.947 --> 18:48.254
[employees groaning]

18:51.894 --> 18:53.832
I did it.

18:53.865 --> 18:55.936
Thank you.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.038
Thank you.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.074
See?

18:59.107 --> 19:00.946
I'm still here.

19:00.979 --> 19:03.684
We're all still here.

19:03.718 --> 19:06.723
[Kevin applauding]

19:09.497 --> 19:10.831
Oh, come on, Dwight!

19:10.866 --> 19:11.701
Come on, man!

19:11.733 --> 19:13.837
We are not
in the playground anymore.

19:13.872 --> 19:15.741
There are new rules.

19:15.776 --> 19:21.052
We have to be mature,
but we can't lose the spirit

19:21.085 --> 19:23.957
of childlike wonder.

19:23.992 --> 19:27.566
What is love, anyway?

19:27.599 --> 19:31.441
Maybe it's supposed
to break all the rules.

19:31.473 --> 19:33.445
Like me and Jan.

19:33.477 --> 19:36.518
Or Oscar and some guy.

19:36.551 --> 19:37.853
Life is short.

19:37.886 --> 19:40.526
When two people
find each other,

19:40.559 --> 19:43.532
what should stand
in their way?

19:43.565 --> 19:46.101
(Mr. Brown)
It is very easy for you
to be a hero.

19:46.136 --> 19:49.477
All you need are honesty,
empathy, respect,

19:49.510 --> 19:50.611
and open-mindedness.

19:50.646 --> 19:53.784
I'm glad today spurred
social change.

19:53.817 --> 19:56.022
That's part of my job
as regional manager.

19:56.056 --> 19:58.026
But you know what,
even if it didn't,

19:58.060 --> 20:00.164
at least we put this matter
to bed.

20:00.196 --> 20:02.402
That's what she said.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.939
Or he said.

20:07.546 --> 20:10.919
Oh, there's Gil,
Oscar's roommate.

20:15.861 --> 20:17.465
I wonder if he knows.

20:19.836 --> 20:21.907
I was going to quit,
but Jan offered me

20:21.941 --> 20:25.749
a three-month paid vacation
and a company car.

20:25.781 --> 20:29.524
All I had to do was sign
something saying I won't sue.

20:29.557 --> 20:31.528
Gil and I
are going to Europe.

20:31.561 --> 20:35.901
Kids, sometimes
it pays to be gay.

20:41.146 --> 20:42.616
"I hope this helps.

20:42.650 --> 20:43.985
Jim."

20:51.267 --> 20:52.770
Nice.

20:52.802 --> 20:55.040
What are you doing?
Shh.

20:55.074 --> 20:56.711
Don't be scared.

21:00.017 --> 21:01.721
[machine whines]

21:04.158 --> 21:05.629
