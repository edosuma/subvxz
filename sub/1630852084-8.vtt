00:10.677 --> 00:13.113
My generation,
we don't live like this.

- So you guys want us
to invest in this place?

00:15.516 --> 00:17.518
- We're thinking it's
gonna cost $40,000.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.520
- Cora, you know this place
could probably be a big,

00:19.620 --> 00:20.487
old headache.

00:20.587 --> 00:21.955
- You have to see
the beauty of it.

00:22.055 --> 00:23.524
- This could be
a great investment.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.627

condition: you get a Dana test.

Can't you just send like a
telegram on a horse or something

01:04.206 --> 01:06.842

this place a chance.

store is closed except for one.

01:19.321 --> 01:20.656

At least it's one store open.

01:22.057 --> 01:23.492
Did you find something
nice for school?

01:23.592 --> 01:27.129
- It was a Big,
Old, and Tall store.

01:29.498 --> 01:33.569
Nothing but flannel...
itchy stuff.

01:35.771 --> 01:38.440
And boots.

01:38.540 --> 01:39.675
Nothing fit me.

18:12.617 --> 18:13.785
- Oh, ssh, ssh.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.253
Here he go--here he go.

18:17.622 --> 18:20.959
- Oh, damn, he got that
doom look on his damn face.

18:24.963 --> 18:26.698
- [clears throat]

18:26.798 --> 18:27.999
- So?

18:30.501 --> 18:33.371
- It's bad.
- See? See? I told your ass.

18:33.471 --> 18:34.706
I told--no, I told you.

18:34.806 --> 18:36.841
- How--how bad?

18:36.941 --> 18:39.043
- Well, I mean, if you
gonna redo them bathrooms,

18:39.143 --> 18:41.479
it's gonna cost you $9,000.

18:41.579 --> 18:42.914
- What?

18:43.848 --> 18:45.783
- Get him.

18:45.884 --> 18:47.752
- Boy.
- Grandpa!

18:47.852 --> 18:50.188
- Get--$9,000?

18:50.288 --> 18:52.090
Get your monkey ass out of here.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.094
I'll fix it my damn self.

18:57.328 --> 18:58.396
- Why so much?

18:58.496 --> 19:00.031
- Well, you're gonna
need some new plumbing.

19:00.131 --> 19:02.166
You got the septic
tank, gotta add that.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.167
And you gonna have to--

19:03.268 --> 19:04.502
- Let me tell you
something, boy.

19:04.602 --> 19:07.772
I can't stand y'all clown-ass
people coming up in here,

19:07.839 --> 19:09.807
trying to rip old people off.

19:09.908 --> 19:12.010
Get your ass out of here.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.778
- Grandpa, enough.

19:13.811 --> 19:15.813
- He still here?
Get out of here!

19:15.914 --> 19:17.148
- You know what? Thank you.

19:17.248 --> 19:19.350
We'll--we'll call you.
- Okay.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.320
Well let me know something soon,
'cause it only gonna get worse.

19:24.522 --> 19:26.791
- I wanna kill him.

19:26.824 --> 19:29.661
- Pops.
- No, I want him murdered.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.996
- You are not a gangster.
What are you talking about?

19:32.096 --> 19:35.466
- I was a big time
gangster in Chicago.

19:35.567 --> 19:37.135
- Yep, here we go.

19:37.235 --> 19:39.938
- How the hell you
think this happened?

19:40.038 --> 19:43.408
Look, back in the day, I
would've made a call--

19:43.508 --> 19:47.145
one call--taken
his monkey ass out.

19:47.245 --> 19:50.448
He'd be swimming
with the fishes.

19:50.548 --> 19:53.117
- Grandpa--why your granddaddy
think he's a gangster?

19:53.218 --> 19:56.821
- Don't think I was a
gangster, I was a gangster.

19:56.921 --> 19:58.690
The other one had two hands.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.558
I was hard.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.894
I was ho-o-ood.

20:02.994 --> 20:07.432
And I can fix all this shit in
here myself...if it kills me.

20:07.532 --> 20:09.033
- Yeah.

20:09.133 --> 20:10.168
Hope that's sooner than later.

20:10.268 --> 20:12.503
- VINNY: I heard that.

20:12.604 --> 20:15.306
- Well, we know there ain't
nothing wrong with his hearing!

20:15.406 --> 20:16.674
- VINNY: Nothing wrong
with my foot either!

20:16.774 --> 20:17.976
- Oh!

20:18.076 --> 20:20.111
- VINNY: It'll reach you
to kick you in your ass.

20:20.211 --> 20:22.447
- Okay, that's enough.

20:22.547 --> 20:25.250
Grandpa Capone.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.985
- Kicking somebody ass?
- I don't know.

20:29.621 --> 20:30.788
- What are we gonna do?

20:30.855 --> 20:32.290
- Pray for a miracle.

20:33.224 --> 20:37.095
- Yeah, well, I hope that
miracle is in Mr. Brown.

20:37.195 --> 20:38.997
- That's a colorful miracle.

20:41.799 --> 20:42.700
But we'll see.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.804
Now, until then...

20:46.871 --> 20:49.807
this is a wrench.
