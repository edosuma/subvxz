All right.

06:31.717 --> 06:33.672
South side, near Lincoln.

06:34.852 --> 06:38.315
- Casino.
- You called it.

06:57.202 --> 06:59.117
Four units on their way.

06:59.158 --> 07:02.700
Driver: Male,
Caucasian, late 20s, sandy wavy hair.

07:02.782 --> 07:04.657
- That's him.
- Yeah.

07:04.738 --> 07:06.855
Same goddamn stunt he pulled six weeks ago.

07:08.565 --> 07:10.603
You two wanna tell me
who we're talking about?

07:10.684 --> 07:13.412
Shut up. I want to hear this.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.873
All units in the vicinity...

13:41.953 --> 13:45.447
3849 reports that the police units
pursuing suspects'vehicle...

13:45.530 --> 13:47.195
were involved in a traffic accident...

13:47.275 --> 13:50.161
at Pruitt and 34th Street.

13:50.242 --> 13:52.475
Poker Palace first. You call in.

13:56.255 --> 14:00.359
Ahhh. 1-Y-10, Code 6. 813 North Cleveland.

15:24.300 --> 15:27.181
$23,500.

15:27.222 --> 15:31.243
Are you sure none of those people
got a good look at you?

15:31.285 --> 15:35.222
You see, we wanna keep you healthy
for next time.

15:35.303 --> 15:37.254
There isn't going to be any next time.

15:40.054 --> 15:42.003
You were late.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.171
Well, well, well. Lookee here.

16:59.325 --> 17:02.044
- Cowboy.
- No shit.

17:12.580 --> 17:15.385
Well?

17:15.424 --> 17:17.777
It kind of looks like him to me.

17:17.858 --> 17:20.415
You sure?

17:21.714 --> 17:23.663
Can't say for sure.

17:27.194 --> 17:29.832
What about you?

17:29.914 --> 17:32.997
You know,
I just didn't get that good a look at him.

17:41.230 --> 17:42.851
You?

17:44.639 --> 17:46.747
She saw him better than I did.

17:46.828 --> 17:49.102
- Who?
- She did.

17:49.143 --> 17:51.214
- What do you mean, "she"?
- On the end.

17:53.242 --> 17:55.190
In the black?

18:07.401 --> 18:09.438
Is that him?

18:13.345 --> 18:17.380
You can take your time, because
there's no way he can ever get to you...

18:17.466 --> 18:19.503
absolutely no way.

18:20.904 --> 18:22.899
It wasn't him.

18:22.984 --> 18:25.023
You sure?

18:26.254 --> 18:28.248
Yeah.

18:32.281 --> 18:34.700
You're positive?

18:36.781 --> 18:38.778
It wasn't him.

18:45.441 --> 18:51.515
How about the rest of you?
Guide dogs for everyone, is that it? Huh?

18:56.822 --> 18:59.495
Planning on looking for work soon?

18:59.538 --> 19:02.086
My line of work is kinda hard to come by.

19:03.190 --> 19:05.228
Depends on where you look.

19:07.945 --> 19:10.790
It depends on who you are.

19:12.658 --> 19:14.695
I don't know.

19:22.071 --> 19:24.194
Some of the criminal types these days...

19:24.279 --> 19:27.802
they, uh, think that
they're real cowboys...

19:29.545 --> 19:34.978
think that they can
just, uh, drive around...

19:35.063 --> 19:37.144
do whatever they want to do...

19:38.842 --> 19:41.515
whenever they wanna do it.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.640
Mm.

19:47.205 --> 19:50.433
I respect a man that's
good at what he does.

19:52.385 --> 19:54.465
I'll tell you something else.

19:54.550 --> 19:57.138
I'm very good at what I do.

20:02.916 --> 20:04.868
Now, last night...

20:06.991 --> 20:09.027
Oh, I forgot.

20:10.725 --> 20:12.933
His memory's not too good
about last night.

20:14.463 --> 20:17.095
- I remember everything.
- Alone in your room?

20:17.180 --> 20:19.134
Yeah.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.975
You can do better than that.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.139
I don't have to.

20:37.395 --> 20:40.506
Go ahead throw it!
It'll cost you two years.

20:40.591 --> 20:42.273
Go on.

20:43.409 --> 20:46.775
You wanna throw it?
Go on. Go on.

20:46.857 --> 20:49.254
Go on.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.743
You know what I'm gonna do?

20:54.258 --> 20:57.789
I'm gonna catch the cowboy
that's never been caught.

20:58.971 --> 21:01.827
Cowboy desperado.

21:06.117 --> 21:08.218
Now get out of here.

22:30.943 --> 22:32.848
Open the door!

22:32.889 --> 22:35.277
Can't you open the goddamn door?

22:35.317 --> 22:37.504
You asshole!
Can't you even open the door?

22:41.837 --> 22:44.552
Drive, you son of a bitch! Drive!

22:49.492 --> 22:51.274
Watch it! Watch that damn truck!

22:54.716 --> 22:56.459
Watch it! Jesus!

23:32.400 --> 23:34.344
Well, well, well.

23:34.424 --> 23:36.812
Look what the old van drug in.

23:37.905 --> 23:40.091
What kind of piece did he have?

23:44.056 --> 23:47.090
Wow!45.

23:47.171 --> 23:49.438
Very nice gun.

23:49.519 --> 23:52.919
You know, that supermarket's
gonna cost you 10 years.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.116
I don't know about any supermarket.

23:56.600 --> 24:00.188
Yeah, you do.
Why don'tcha come on inside?

24:10.410 --> 24:13.999
- How about a beer?
- I'd rather not, if that's okay by you.

24:14.082 --> 24:16.669
Well, it's fine by me.

24:18.588 --> 24:22.218
Today's your lucky day.
I'm feeling generous.

24:23.595 --> 24:25.681
I'm gonna give you a choice.

24:26.975 --> 24:29.436
You and your bunch are
gonna do one more job...

24:30.604 --> 24:34.234
a bank, nice big one...

24:34.276 --> 24:37.238
for free.

24:37.280 --> 24:40.284
You're gonna hire a new driver, that's all.

24:40.326 --> 24:42.287
A good one.

24:44.373 --> 24:47.127
I don't work with cops.

24:48.796 --> 24:51.132
Oh, gosh.

24:51.216 --> 24:53.260
I wish you hadn't said that.

24:57.099 --> 25:01.062
Ow! God damn you!

25:02.648 --> 25:04.651
Now, about this bank.

25:04.734 --> 25:08.740
Cash on hand: 200,000.

25:08.823 --> 25:11.702
That's bait for the man you're gonna hire.

25:12.995 --> 25:14.956
He does know banks.

25:16.667 --> 25:18.628
You set it up in a week or you're...

25:18.670 --> 25:20.798
Yeah, I know all about 10 years.

25:20.881 --> 25:23.009
Well, that's the choice.

25:23.092 --> 25:25.471
Do 10 years wearing a number...

25:25.512 --> 25:28.224
or trust me...

25:28.308 --> 25:31.771
and walk away free.

25:35.442 --> 25:39.031
- You're getting in pretty deep on this
one, aren't you? - That's my business.

25:39.114 --> 25:42.911
Setting up bank jobs? I don't remember
that being part of taking the oath.

25:42.994 --> 25:45.206
We're getting the money back, jerk-off.

25:45.289 --> 25:48.377
And we're catching somebody
that's never been caught.

25:48.460 --> 25:50.463
That's a public service.

25:53.133 --> 25:55.386
How many banks in this city...

25:55.470 --> 25:57.389
get hit every month?

25:57.472 --> 25:59.976
Oh, 15, on the average.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.020
How many end up with a collar?

26:02.062 --> 26:05.024
On the average?
About eight or nine.

26:05.066 --> 26:07.361
See there?
We're raising the average.

26:07.403 --> 26:09.864
Brilliant.
Try to sell that downtown.

26:09.906 --> 26:13.536
I sold it to myself, that's enough.
I want the cowboy.

26:13.578 --> 26:17.208
You wanna play this your way?
Fine. You're the boss.

26:17.249 --> 26:19.878
But I'm telling you something:
I'm in this for the win.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.047
You blow this thing then you can
say good-bye to your badge.

26:22.089 --> 26:25.510
You know something? Maybe I oughta
investigate your background, huh?

26:25.594 --> 26:27.722
Did you ever think of that?
Some little item there?

26:27.764 --> 26:30.392
Maybe there's something we should
know about. Maybe you're a fruiter.

26:30.434 --> 26:32.395
- Yeah.
- Or maybe you took a bribe.

26:32.437 --> 26:34.398
- I wonder how much it was.
- Investigate all you want.

26:34.439 --> 26:37.402
- You'd just be disappointed. - I'm not
gonna take your word for it. How's that?

26:37.443 --> 26:40.990
I got a wife and I got a kid and I got
12 years' service toward a pension.

26:41.073 --> 26:44.202
Now, if you think I'm gonna
let you blow that for me, you're crazy.

26:44.286 --> 26:46.956
- Think about it.
- I already have...

26:48.500 --> 26:50.461
asshole.

27:22.620 --> 27:25.085
I didn't think you'd be the one to pay me.

27:27.968 --> 27:30.643
Kind of taking a chance, aren't you?

27:31.813 --> 27:33.776
I'll pay you here if you want.

27:35.490 --> 27:37.453
Come on up.

27:56.214 --> 28:00.226
I've been paid to do a few things before...

28:00.309 --> 28:03.234
but I was never paid to be an alibi.

28:06.326 --> 28:08.833
You're going to ask me why I did it?

28:11.675 --> 28:14.432
I have a friend that pays the rent...

28:14.516 --> 28:16.522
lives out of town...

28:17.608 --> 28:20.157
visits me once or twice a month.

28:24.377 --> 28:26.968
Lately the checks haven't been so regular.

28:31.898 --> 28:33.904
I need the money.

28:39.001 --> 28:41.007
Hello.

28:43.556 --> 28:45.854
No, I don't think...

28:50.032 --> 28:51.954
He's on his way up to see me.

28:56.300 --> 28:58.431
The cop.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.502
Guess that means I can come in.

29:24.256 --> 29:26.300
Nice place.

29:28.427 --> 29:31.222
Terrific view. Ahhh.

29:33.266 --> 29:35.727
You didn't come by to tell me that.

29:42.067 --> 29:44.361
You saw the man who was driving the car.

29:46.405 --> 29:49.074
And you saw the man up
against the brick wall.

29:51.326 --> 29:54.997
And you know it's the same man...

29:55.080 --> 29:57.208
yet you didn't identify him.

29:58.709 --> 30:01.379
Are you afraid of him?

30:01.462 --> 30:03.798
No.

30:03.881 --> 30:05.925
Are you afraid of me?

30:10.096 --> 30:12.057
No.

30:13.099 --> 30:15.060
I just don't like you.

30:16.103 --> 30:18.063
Mm.

30:19.481 --> 30:21.483
You got a reason?

30:25.029 --> 30:28.407
Must be because I'm such a good cop.

30:31.411 --> 30:33.413
How old are you?

30:39.127 --> 30:41.421
Twenty-two.

30:42.547 --> 30:44.549
I did a little checking.

30:48.053 --> 30:50.055
What else did you check?

30:51.181 --> 30:54.101
Well, a young girl like yourself...

30:54.185 --> 30:57.897
you sure have been around the track
a few times, honey.

30:59.732 --> 31:02.485
Led a real active life.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.571
Get out.

31:05.989 --> 31:08.491
No.

31:08.575 --> 31:11.078
We're gonna do a little
business, you and I.

31:19.962 --> 31:22.089
Look at it!

31:25.426 --> 31:27.428
You sure that's not him?

31:31.933 --> 31:34.102
It's not him.

31:35.437 --> 31:37.522
Really?

31:38.648 --> 31:40.776
Maybe you oughta be afraid of me.

31:44.947 --> 31:47.116
I ran a make on you.

31:52.455 --> 31:55.625
You're clean. No problem.

32:00.380 --> 32:02.590
Of course, there was that, uh...

32:02.674 --> 32:04.593
one little scrape.

32:04.676 --> 32:06.595
You remember?

32:06.678 --> 32:09.139
The kinda nasty one.

32:09.222 --> 32:12.184
The one that got swept under the rug.

32:16.397 --> 32:18.941
Now, when your memory improves, honey...

32:19.025 --> 32:21.068
give me a call.

32:47.722 --> 32:49.765
No guarantees.

32:52.060 --> 32:55.438
- Never has been.
- He might still be down there.

33:51.456 --> 33:54.417
- How'd the new girl work out?
- She did her job.

33:55.877 --> 33:58.547
Who did you have pay her off?

33:58.630 --> 34:00.549
I did it myself.

34:02.175 --> 34:04.470
That's not like you.

34:04.511 --> 34:06.347
Why am I here?

34:06.430 --> 34:08.681
Some people wanna meet.

34:08.766 --> 34:11.851
They're from downtown.
They've done a few jobs.

34:11.936 --> 34:14.063
- Shooters.
- Yeah.

34:15.063 --> 34:17.190
I told you I don't like guns.

34:17.275 --> 34:20.152
I know. But they're looking to move up.

34:20.235 --> 34:23.156
They got their eyes set
on something special.

34:23.239 --> 34:25.824
They know my price?

34:25.909 --> 34:28.036
Everybody knows your price.

34:28.120 --> 34:31.123
Even paid me $300 just to get to you.

34:33.250 --> 34:35.502
You did.

35:18.900 --> 35:21.077
How you been?

35:22.083 --> 35:24.091
I'm okay.

35:25.727 --> 35:27.736
You two know each other?

35:27.779 --> 35:30.919
Couple of years ago,
we worked a two-car job.

35:32.049 --> 35:33.975
You already have a driver.

35:34.060 --> 35:36.740
He don't have the balls
for driving anymore.

35:41.055 --> 35:43.064
You work for a piece, right?

35:43.148 --> 35:45.366
$10,000 up front...

35:45.408 --> 35:47.670
against 15%.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.807
How do we know you're that good?

35:51.900 --> 35:53.364
Get in.

36:27.110 --> 36:28.994
All right!
Enough, lunatic. Enough of this shit!

36:56.700 --> 36:57.821
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

36:58.168 --> 37:00.173
We believe you! We believe you!

37:12.607 --> 37:14.238
Enough! Enough! Stop, will you?

37:25.567 --> 37:26.956
I mean, for Christ's sake!

37:36.825 --> 37:37.951
For Christ's sakes!

37:56.705 --> 37:57.334
Jesus!

38:12.900 --> 38:15.216
Easy, easy.

38:17.911 --> 38:20.334
Better get new plates
if you plan on taking it out again.

38:21.998 --> 38:23.335
People might be looking for you.

38:30.408 --> 38:31.214
You're crazy.

38:43.081 --> 38:44.237
We'll make you a deal.

38:48.281 --> 38:50.247
I don't work with people like you.

38:53.604 --> 38:54.512
Or him.

39:09.100 --> 39:11.889
This plan of yours for our friend...

39:15.892 --> 39:17.804
taking a little long to set up, isn't it?

39:17.891 --> 39:20.309
Gotta be patient, pal.

39:20.391 --> 39:22.974
- Ah, I see.
- Every job has its problems.

39:23.058 --> 39:25.392
Couldn't be you just figured it wrong?

39:27.100 --> 39:29.101
You know something?

39:31.308 --> 39:34.060
I think I'm gonna have to help you
with your education.

39:36.228 --> 39:38.642
This is the quiet part of the hunt.

39:38.727 --> 39:42.807
The trap's all set.
Cowboy's out there somewhere.

39:42.892 --> 39:46.143
It wouldn't be any fun
if the cowboy walked into it, would it?

39:46.225 --> 39:49.810
That'd be no fun.
You know the best part of our job is?

39:49.895 --> 39:53.562
It's just a game. It's either them or us.

39:57.062 --> 40:00.143
- Maybe me and you.
- Oh, no way, Jose.

40:00.228 --> 40:02.647
You're not even in my league.

40:02.729 --> 40:06.313
I tell you what, though.
I'm a very generous man.

40:06.396 --> 40:09.853
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna help you be a better cop.

40:09.937 --> 40:11.981
You know how?

40:12.063 --> 40:14.313
You know what you do
first thing every morning?

40:14.397 --> 40:16.650
Read the sports page.

40:16.729 --> 40:18.645
You know why?

40:18.729 --> 40:20.649
Best part of the newspaper.

40:20.729 --> 40:24.144
Winners, losers, how it happened, score.

40:25.982 --> 40:28.980
Now, we've got a better game
than the one they give the players.

40:29.061 --> 40:32.188
They don't retire us after 10 years.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.650
Just one thing.

40:37.066 --> 40:39.312
You gotta be a player...

40:39.400 --> 40:41.480
a real player...

40:41.566 --> 40:43.732
not just filling out a position.

40:45.401 --> 40:48.315
I guess you figure you're a winner.

40:48.401 --> 40:51.065
That's it. And you're a loser.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.942
But I think you'd like to be a winner.

40:55.567 --> 40:58.858
And you're gonna show me the way, huh?

40:58.943 --> 41:02.152
Unless, of course,
you turn into a complete asshole first.

41:04.651 --> 41:06.651
Let's move.

41:23.609 --> 41:26.323
I just wanna talk.

41:28.986 --> 41:33.570
We need you. You're valuable.

41:34.780 --> 41:37.404
I already gave you guys an answer.

41:40.489 --> 41:42.820
We don't like that answer.

41:43.987 --> 41:47.322
Be friendly. Do things our way.

41:51.153 --> 41:53.238
Go ahead and pull the trigger.

42:06.198 --> 42:10.202
You... You do anything else...

42:10.283 --> 42:12.283
I'll come back.

42:13.489 --> 42:15.992
I'll kill you.

42:30.114 --> 42:32.702
I'm just trying to do my job.

42:32.788 --> 42:34.785
So am I.

42:36.786 --> 42:38.785
Go home.

42:40.620 --> 42:42.786
I just wanted to talk.

42:44.619 --> 42:46.623
You did.

43:13.121 --> 43:16.620
- Let's talk, okay?
- Go ahead.

43:16.704 --> 43:19.999
I'm having a very big
problem with your boy.

43:20.041 --> 43:22.374
He's not too thrilled in working with us.

43:24.208 --> 43:26.875
I can understand that.

43:26.957 --> 43:30.460
Look, I don't know what to do.
I'm doing the best I can, you know?

43:32.542 --> 43:35.375
You know what to do.
You just did it.

43:36.873 --> 43:40.960
You came in here
and asked me to save your ass.

43:42.001 --> 43:43.959
That's what I'm gonna do...

43:44.042 --> 43:46.043
save your ass.

44:14.837 --> 44:17.879
Guess I can't leave you alone, can I?

44:24.048 --> 44:26.337
Guess I'm just a real friendly guy.

44:28.339 --> 44:32.380
A friend of yours told me where I could
find you in the middle of the day.

44:32.466 --> 44:34.380
I don't have any friends.

44:34.464 --> 44:36.503
That's right.

44:36.589 --> 44:38.505
No friends.

44:38.589 --> 44:40.673
No steady job.

44:40.756 --> 44:42.799
No girlfriend.

44:42.881 --> 44:44.965
You live real cheap.

44:46.841 --> 44:49.175
You don't ask any questions.

44:49.218 --> 44:52.592
Boy, you got it down real tight.

44:52.672 --> 44:55.508
So tight, there's no
room for anything else.

44:58.341 --> 45:00.425
That's a real sad song.

45:02.094 --> 45:06.343
Only trouble is,
sad songs ain't selling this year.

45:18.344 --> 45:20.425
Maybe I'm your friend.

45:25.097 --> 45:27.758
Present. I brought it for you.

45:29.258 --> 45:32.762
Found it on the floorboard
of some Ford a cowboy boosted.

45:32.845 --> 45:35.718
Go ahead, take it.

45:36.846 --> 45:39.095
Save you the trouble of making another one.

45:51.680 --> 45:54.014
I really like chasing you.

45:58.726 --> 46:01.058
Sounds like you got a problem.

46:03.182 --> 46:05.060
Oh-ho.

46:05.136 --> 46:08.971
I'm much better at this game than you are.

46:09.014 --> 46:11.182
You play against me,
pal, you're gonna lose.

46:13.141 --> 46:15.307
You win, you make some money.

46:15.391 --> 46:19.017
I win, you're gonna do 15 years.

46:22.600 --> 46:24.599
How about it, driver?

46:54.700 --> 46:57.558
My price has doubled.

46:57.640 --> 47:00.872
Come on. Who do you think you're
dealing with? That's 30% of the take.

47:00.955 --> 47:04.724
That's right. Special price because
I'm working with second-raters.

47:07.955 --> 47:10.151
We'll make you a deal.

47:10.233 --> 47:12.718
I want him to say it.

47:12.801 --> 47:15.203
Yeah.

47:15.245 --> 47:17.896
One more thing. You're not coming.

47:21.126 --> 47:23.530
You don't give many choices, do you, pal?

47:23.612 --> 47:25.393
That's right.

47:30.405 --> 47:33.553
It's a two-man job inside.
Uh, you'll get your cut later.

47:36.701 --> 47:38.731
I don't like it.

47:38.813 --> 47:41.009
That's the whole idea.

47:46.643 --> 47:49.293
Boy, it's tough to like
that man, I tell you.

48:09.755 --> 48:13.359
We got him. He's doing the job.

48:13.442 --> 48:15.181
Look, I gotta tell you something.

48:15.223 --> 48:17.295
It's very important for you to get this.

48:17.377 --> 48:20.152
Hold up your end of this deal.

48:20.194 --> 48:24.129
'Cause if I should see any cops at all
in front of that bank, any at all...

48:24.212 --> 48:26.117
there's gonna be a lot
of shooting going on.

48:33.614 --> 48:36.058
Now listen to me!
I don't want any shooting.

48:36.141 --> 48:40.035
- Got that? Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

48:41.609 --> 48:43.680
I just need one thing out of you...

48:43.762 --> 48:45.916
and that's the drop point.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.934
Understand?

48:51.839 --> 48:54.822
That way, I get my man, I get the money...

48:54.905 --> 48:57.887
and the money gets back
to the people it belongs to.

49:01.077 --> 49:04.101
Straighten up your little corduroy jacket.

49:07.456 --> 49:09.816
Now piss off. I'm sick of lookin' at you.

49:09.858 --> 49:13.089
- You really do like to lean, don'tcha?
- It's part of the job, pal.

49:13.172 --> 49:16.237
Yeah? It doesn't make things too easy,
lemme tell you.

49:20.545 --> 49:22.575
The man's afraid of heights.

49:30.113 --> 49:32.267
Goddamn it! You set the alarm off!

49:32.350 --> 49:34.836
Come on! Now move!

49:34.877 --> 49:37.279
Move, move, move, move, move!

49:37.362 --> 49:39.350
Let's go.

49:47.013 --> 49:49.374
- No!
- You triggered the alarm!

49:49.457 --> 49:52.233
You're starting to
scare the shit out of me!

50:11.121 --> 50:13.357
All right, let's move.

50:13.440 --> 50:17.168
I covered him out the back. He's okay.
Let's move, all right?

50:46.600 --> 50:50.741
I never thought I'd be standing around,
waiting for this cowboy to make it.

50:50.824 --> 50:52.810
Well, you are...

50:53.804 --> 50:56.123
and he will.

50:56.205 --> 50:58.938
You don't have any doubts, huh?

50:59.020 --> 51:01.670
About our desperado?

51:01.753 --> 51:03.740
About your badge.

51:08.212 --> 51:11.026
Boy. You are really an
asshole, you know that?

51:48.600 --> 51:51.455
Can't get over the mistake you made.

51:53.233 --> 51:55.262
You've been set up, you know?

51:55.303 --> 51:57.538
By a cop.

51:57.621 --> 52:00.435
That's right.

52:00.477 --> 52:03.704
He's waiting for you right now
at the wrong place.

52:03.746 --> 52:06.146
Me and my friend don't want to show up.

52:07.554 --> 52:10.946
You two hotshots have both been set up,
haven't you?

52:11.029 --> 52:13.885
You know what always amazed me about you?

52:13.968 --> 52:17.320
A guy with your attitude
never carries a gun.

52:18.396 --> 52:22.078
That's stupid. Very stupid.

55:56.600 --> 56:00.238
I want a room. One night, maybe two.

56:00.321 --> 56:02.306
Five bucks a night.

56:05.036 --> 56:06.937
I'm expecting someone.

56:07.019 --> 56:09.088
If she shows, send her right up.

56:11.073 --> 56:13.510
Hey, you want a TV?
It's a dollar extra.

57:01.800 --> 57:04.486
Get on over and keep
your eye our little lady.

57:04.569 --> 57:05.809
Right.

57:05.892 --> 57:08.288
Forget it.
I'll put an A. P. B. Out on all of them.

57:08.329 --> 57:11.140
No, you won't.

57:11.223 --> 57:13.744
What the hell are you talking about?

57:13.785 --> 57:16.265
It's tough doing business with lowlifes.

57:17.341 --> 57:19.530
They're unreliable.

57:19.571 --> 57:22.425
But we got a few moves left.

57:22.507 --> 57:25.813
Just, uh, makes the game
a little more interesting, that's all.

57:25.854 --> 57:28.128
Yeah, well, I've been watching your moves.

57:28.169 --> 57:30.773
I gotta tell you, I'm
not all that impressed.

57:30.815 --> 57:32.797
No shit?

57:32.879 --> 57:35.237
No shit.

57:35.279 --> 57:38.542
We got a mutiny with this man here!

57:38.584 --> 57:40.733
- Shit.
- Wait a second.

57:42.221 --> 57:47.140
Now, you're still on my team,
and I am your manager.

57:47.182 --> 57:50.487
You do exactly what I
tell you to do, got it?

57:51.810 --> 57:53.794
Suit yourself.

57:53.877 --> 57:55.901
Now you're talking.

58:10.655 --> 58:12.558
What about the other two?

58:12.640 --> 58:14.747
I haven't seen them.

58:16.898 --> 58:19.335
You better stay out of sight for a while.

58:19.418 --> 58:22.022
There's a cop trying to put this one on me.

58:22.105 --> 58:25.618
The money's hot. I wanna trade it in.

58:25.699 --> 58:28.014
The exchange rate's 4-to-1 at best.

58:28.097 --> 58:32.438
I'll take it. The train station, 9:00.

58:32.479 --> 58:35.289
That sandwich counter by the lockers.

58:36.600 --> 58:38.540
I don't like it.

58:38.582 --> 58:40.771
I didn't think you would.

58:47.255 --> 58:49.155
I'll set it up...

58:50.393 --> 58:52.541
but they won't do it if you're there.

58:52.624 --> 58:55.556
Tonight you'll be hotter than the cash.

58:55.596 --> 58:57.827
I'll get somebody.

58:59.686 --> 59:02.123
Keep your eye out for those other two.

59:03.692 --> 59:05.923
They'll know I have their money.

59:05.965 --> 59:10.134
I told you, I'm not
gonna get killed for you.

59:35.162 --> 59:37.145
Room 3004.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.504
I don't know where he is.
I haven't seen him.

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:29.512
Just tell me what you want.

01:00:32.692 --> 01:00:36.120
I just set things up.

01:00:37.689 --> 01:00:39.836
It's his business what happens after that.

01:00:42.812 --> 01:00:45.742
If it was jewelry or bonds,
he might come to me.

01:00:45.783 --> 01:00:47.766
But with cash, he doesn't need me.

01:00:54.705 --> 01:00:57.637
I won't see him till the next one.

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.242
In a hotel downtown.

01:01:39.233 --> 01:01:41.257
The Doran.

01:01:45.219 --> 01:01:48.647
The money's in a locker
at the train station.

01:01:48.687 --> 01:01:51.617
9:00 he's trading for smaller bills.

01:01:54.425 --> 01:01:56.406
That's all.

01:02:07.644 --> 01:02:08.556
I warned him.

01:02:11.923 --> 01:02:14.218
I told him I wouldn't get killed for him.

01:02:18.288 --> 01:02:19.202
Sure.

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.844
You don't have to play.
If everything goes all right...

01:03:18.927 --> 01:03:20.989
I'll have your money by tomorrow morning.

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:28.163
I'll see it through.

01:03:31.173 --> 01:03:33.361
I think you're crazy.

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:38.182
Put the key in a safe-deposit box
for six months...

01:03:38.265 --> 01:03:40.285
then go get the money.

01:03:41.605 --> 01:03:44.038
I'm on a streak. I'm gonna play it out.

01:03:44.079 --> 01:03:46.059
I'm gonna get it tonight.

01:03:46.142 --> 01:03:48.656
I know all about streaks.

01:03:48.698 --> 01:03:51.460
Every player says,
"This time is different."

01:03:54.718 --> 01:03:57.233
Maybe we are alike.

01:03:57.274 --> 01:03:58.966
No.

01:03:59.047 --> 01:04:01.934
When I lose, I just go broke.

01:04:02.017 --> 01:04:04.037
You go to jail.

01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:10.758
If it wasn't for that cop,
I'd tell you to go ahead.

01:04:12.323 --> 01:04:14.716
He's the reason I've got the rush on.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.202
You don't care about the money.

01:04:20.283 --> 01:04:22.425
Might even send it to him.

01:04:22.508 --> 01:04:24.571
Sucker's game.

01:04:30.796 --> 01:04:33.393
You think... maybe...

01:04:34.963 --> 01:04:37.148
you could wait for a while?

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.168
Coffee.

01:05:52.903 --> 01:05:54.922
I'll be right back for my change.

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:26.260
Ah, he's about 27, 28 years old.
He's a punk.

01:06:37.707 --> 01:06:41.001
Looks like theyjust switched keys.

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:43.719
Yeah. He's going back
to the lockers right now.

01:06:43.802 --> 01:06:46.355
He's wearing one of those cowboy suits.

01:06:46.438 --> 01:06:48.660
He's got a beard... a real sleaze-O.

01:06:48.743 --> 01:06:51.131
He's exchanging the bag.

01:06:51.213 --> 01:06:53.108
Black attaché case.

01:06:53.191 --> 01:06:55.413
Yeah, dirty money for clean.

01:06:55.496 --> 01:06:57.885
Yeah. He's moving...
headed for the platform.

01:06:57.968 --> 01:07:01.673
He's coming your way.
Right. I'll stick with him.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.131
Shit!

01:08:12.494 --> 01:08:15.539
- Look at your bag, pal? - All right.
There's just some papers in it.

01:08:15.622 --> 01:08:17.841
We'll see.

01:08:24.957 --> 01:08:27.795
- How about you then?
- Yeah. Go ahead. Take a look.

01:09:35.899 --> 01:09:37.828
- Yeah?
- Police.

01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:40.336
- We're checking all the luggage.
- Just a minute.

01:09:40.417 --> 01:09:42.388
Not just a minute. Now!

01:10:07.725 --> 01:10:10.765
Hey. What the hell are you trying to...

01:10:10.846 --> 01:10:13.104
- Is that yours?
- It's not mine.

01:10:13.144 --> 01:10:15.116
Yours?

01:10:16.554 --> 01:10:18.443
- Is that yours?
- Look, man, I'm cool.

01:10:18.526 --> 01:10:20.414
- Is it yours?
- No!

01:10:20.497 --> 01:10:22.385
- Do you have one?
- Yeah. I gotta bag. It's up here.

01:10:22.467 --> 01:10:25.095
- Where? Where?
- It's gone!

01:10:25.178 --> 01:10:27.601
- Was it light brown?
- Yeah, that's right, man.

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.782
You okay, lady?

01:11:45.618 --> 01:11:49.430
A man took my purse. He's got the key.

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:52.378
He ran to the other side of the station.

01:12:13.928 --> 01:12:16.428
There!

01:12:18.026 --> 01:12:20.237
All right. We got trouble. Go!

01:12:20.319 --> 01:12:22.203
Go, go!

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:52.115
Let's get out of here!

01:21:18.995 --> 01:21:20.079
- Look out! Look out!
- Aaah!

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:43.841
Give up.

01:23:11.529 --> 01:23:13.519
I just did the driving.

01:23:13.558 --> 01:23:15.550
I ain't got no part in anything else.

01:23:54.707 --> 01:23:56.429
Go home.

01:24:44.812 --> 01:24:47.439
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:24:49.475 --> 01:24:51.262
I'll see you in a couple of minutes.

01:26:02.535 --> 01:26:03.727
Gotcha.

01:26:17.028 --> 01:26:18.345
What happened?

01:26:20.206 --> 01:26:22.035
Looks like we both got swindled.

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.177
Looks like we both got ripped off...

01:26:25.611 --> 01:26:27.737
by the exchange man.

01:26:29.373 --> 01:26:31.338
Lot of crooks around these days.

01:26:48.974 --> 01:26:50.695
Driver?

01:26:54.054 --> 01:26:57.059
Sure you don't wanna keep this?

01:27:14.003 --> 01:27:16.072
Here.

01:27:16.151 --> 01:27:17.985
Come on.
