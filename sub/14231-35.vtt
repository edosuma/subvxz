[inflating]

01:10.862 --> 01:12.238

Whoa! That'll get

Um, it isn't national yodel day
again, is it, Dad?

01:39.849 --> 01:41.267
Oh, no, son!

01:41.351 --> 01:43.645
You see, I'm adding a whole full dollar

01:43.728 --> 01:45.605
to our monthly mortgage payment.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.569
Now, instead of 35 years,

01:51.653 --> 01:54.322
we'll have this house all paid off

01:54.406 --> 01:58.076
in just 34 years and 364 days!

01:58.159 --> 02:00.453
So, as soon as I can get
this money to the bank...

02:03.123 --> 02:06.376
We're gonna have us a wingding
to end all blowouts!

02:06.418 --> 02:07.877
Ahyuck!

02:07.961 --> 02:12.007

02:13.883 --> 02:17.846
Oops! We'll have party hats, and whistles

02:17.971 --> 02:21.016

02:21.099 --> 02:23.184

02:38.366 --> 02:41.870
That Goof left his lawn ornaments
over here again?

02:41.953 --> 02:43.538
I can't get out of my own bed

02:43.621 --> 02:45.373
without tripping over his trash, and I...

02:45.457 --> 02:47.208
[grunting]

02:48.501 --> 02:51.421
What's he think this is,

-I saw it first!
-You did not! I did.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.391
-Mine!
-Give me it, you...

03:03.475 --> 03:05.018
[Peg] all right, break it up!

03:05.769 --> 03:07.896
What are you two fighting over?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.439
We're not fighting, Mom,

03:09.522 --> 03:12.108
We're negotiating a business transaction.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.902
And I got dibs on this trash!

03:13.985 --> 03:16.571
You're fighting to do chores?

03:16.738 --> 03:19.074
Well, Dad started an incentive program...

03:19.157 --> 03:22.160
And each and every job pays
its own special price!

03:22.243 --> 03:24.746
Yeah, like, taking out the trash
pays 5 cents.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.539
And that nickel's got my name on it!

03:26.623 --> 03:27.749
I saw it first.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.376
-Mine!
-Pistol, it's mine!

03:29.459 --> 03:30.627
-Let go!
-Give it to me, pistol.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.836
-No!
-I swear I'm gonna...

03:31.920 --> 03:36.800
[shrieks] Oh, my beautiful clean floor!

03:36.883 --> 03:38.802
Hey, no problemo, Mom!

03:38.885 --> 03:40.887
'Cause according to the incentive program,

03:40.970 --> 03:43.682
cleaning the kitchen floor pays a dime!

03:43.765 --> 03:48.269
Almost as much as fixing a broken window!

03:48.353 --> 03:49.979
Don't even think about it.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.149
I better have a talk
with that husband of mine.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.528
Hmm, the place looks like a million bucks,

03:56.611 --> 03:58.780
if I don't say so myself.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.115
[doorbell rings]

04:05.203 --> 04:06.788
Hmm, must be autumn,

04:06.871 --> 04:09.040
the flamingos
are returning to Cappuccino.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.503
Hello, neighbor. Just thought I'd drop by

04:13.586 --> 04:15.755
to drop off a few of your things.

04:15.839 --> 04:19.426
And tell you to keep your own junk
in your own house!

04:19.509 --> 04:21.928
Like this for instance,
this, and these, and those.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.138
And that, and don't forget that.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.723
And then there's this stupid thing.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.725
And last and least, this!

04:26.808 --> 04:28.560
Thanks, Pete! But you know,

04:28.643 --> 04:31.312
I don't think this is
my ice cream machine.

04:31.396 --> 04:35.233
Let me test her out. I know just the hum
that mine hums.

04:40.739 --> 04:41.656
[whirring]

04:41.740 --> 04:44.701
Hmm, might be and might not be.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.162
Let me hear it in the speed of G.

04:47.245 --> 04:50.081
[vibrating]
Hey, now watch it there, Goofer,

04:50.165 --> 04:51.875
You don't want to...

04:51.958 --> 04:53.293
Close, but no guitar.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.711
Let me hear her on high.

04:54.794 --> 04:55.879
No!

04:55.962 --> 04:58.340
Nope, it's a nice machine,
all right-y.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.050
-But it's not mine.
-Turn it off!

05:00.133 --> 05:01.301
Turn it off,

05:01.384 --> 05:04.387
A-W-f, off!

05:04.471 --> 05:05.930
[straining]

05:06.014 --> 05:07.474
[crashing]

05:09.100 --> 05:10.852
Now, look what you did.

05:10.935 --> 05:14.522
You went and gave me a Goof twitch!

05:14.606 --> 05:16.441
I just got one thing to say to you!

05:16.649 --> 05:19.652
You better stop leaving
your crud laying around,

05:19.736 --> 05:22.655
or someday you're gonna lose
something important!

05:22.947 --> 05:25.325
Yeah! You're right, Pete! I ought to put

05:25.408 --> 05:27.160
my mortgage money somewhere safe

05:27.243 --> 05:28.620
'til I can get it in the bank.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.082
Well, I'm glad you're finally catching on!

05:36.252 --> 05:38.380
With all the burglar types running around,

05:38.463 --> 05:41.341
I can't be too careless
when it comes to my money.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.094
I got to hide it so good,
i won't know where I put it.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.472
Well, maybe in a loaf of bread
in the bread box.

05:47.555 --> 05:50.016
Or up in the gutters. Or under the cat.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.351
[screeching]

05:51.434 --> 05:52.894
Or maybe in the plumbing pipes
or...

05:54.312 --> 05:55.605
[honks]

05:58.316 --> 06:01.695
I got it! I'll tape it to
Maxie's rolling skate!

06:03.697 --> 06:05.448
Ahyuck! Perfect!

06:05.532 --> 06:08.785
No burglar's gonna be dumb
enough to look there!

06:09.077 --> 06:10.537
[screeching]

06:15.542 --> 06:19.004
Why that half-stepping,
low-ridin', crummfritterin'...

06:20.422 --> 06:21.256
Ow!

06:26.594 --> 06:29.180
Hmm, what have we here?

06:29.889 --> 06:32.684
Why, it must be the Goof's mortgage money!

06:32.767 --> 06:35.020
And after I told him not to go...

06:37.647 --> 06:41.985
Say, maybe I ought to teach that
absentminded lame-o a lesson

06:42.068 --> 06:44.654
about leaving things laying around.

06:44.738 --> 06:48.116
Yeah, I'll just hold onto this a while

06:48.199 --> 06:51.077
and let him squirm. That'll teach him!

06:51.286 --> 06:55.915
[laughing] I'll just hide the cash
in here for safekeeping...

06:56.750 --> 06:59.794
Then sit back and enjoy the show.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.383
Nope, not there.

07:05.467 --> 07:08.553
I know! I bet it's right here
under the carpet.

07:13.183 --> 07:16.102
Of course, I could've dropped it
up here in the chimney.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.147
You never know, Maxie!
It might have fell out of my pocket

07:19.230 --> 07:21.149
while I was taking a bath.

07:21.232 --> 07:22.942
[raucous laughter]

07:23.026 --> 07:25.987
-Would you look at that guy?
-Pete, what are you doing?

07:26.071 --> 07:28.156
Er, oh, just bird watching.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.657
There's a rare cuckoo next door

07:29.741 --> 07:31.993
doing some very amusing things.

07:32.077 --> 07:35.497
Your incentive program has
turned our children into

07:35.580 --> 07:37.749
a couple of greedy little money-grubbers.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.377
Ooh, then it's a success, huh?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.212
You should see what they're...

07:44.255 --> 07:46.132
[Pistol] Dumped the trash,
cleaned up after chainsaw,

07:46.216 --> 07:47.175
-swept the floor!
-Washed the walls,

07:47.258 --> 07:48.635
cleaned up after chainsaw!

07:48.718 --> 07:53.932
That totals $18 and 44,
ah, 45 cents for me.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.184
And $21.12 cents for me.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.353
I rest my case.

07:58.603 --> 08:02.440
Not so fast. First, I got to deduct
your room and board,

08:02.524 --> 08:05.276
and employer tax, sociable insecurity,
disability,

08:05.360 --> 08:07.696
and a dollar for the
presidential campaign fund.

08:07.779 --> 08:11.032
And that leaves 75 cents for you, P.J.,

08:11.116 --> 08:14.119
And 83 for you, sweet pea.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.246
Isn't this illegal or something?

08:16.329 --> 08:20.625
Aw, it's just the cold hard reality
of high finance, pumpkin.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.503
An honest dollar is worth maybe 2 bits...

08:23.586 --> 08:26.172
And a fast buck is worth
its weight in gold.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.591
But when you learn to make
2 bucks for every buck,

08:28.675 --> 08:31.344
you know you're on the right track!

08:31.428 --> 08:33.888
No, no. I'll get that, Mom,
50 cents a load!

08:33.972 --> 08:36.725
I get to sort the socks, 14 cents a pair!

08:36.808 --> 08:40.729
There, you see, Peg, it's just nickel and
dime stuff,

08:40.812 --> 08:42.230
Nothing to get worked up over.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.442
Okay. It's your own piggy bank
you're breaking.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.901
But just remember,

08:47.318 --> 08:49.404
I warned you.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.910
I get to sew the pockets back on!

08:55.994 --> 08:57.996
There's nothing wrong with the pockets.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.377
[laughs] Hey, I like the way you think.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.259
[growling]

09:23.104 --> 09:24.939
[rhythmic knocking]

09:25.023 --> 09:29.277
Don't we get 3 cents
for answering the door?

09:29.361 --> 09:31.613
-[both] I'll get it!
-[P.J.] I want to answer it!

09:31.696 --> 09:33.198
-It's mine!
-No, it isn't, it's mine!

09:33.281 --> 09:35.367
-Me! Get out of the way!
-Let me answer it!

09:35.450 --> 09:39.287
And there you see the result of
your little economic experiment.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.625
Hiya, Peej.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.753
We just came over
to tell you the bad news.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.673
Dad lost the mortgage money.

09:49.756 --> 09:53.468
Oh, he did? Aw, gee, Peg,

09:53.551 --> 09:55.762
ain't that disasterful?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.556
And we'll never be able
to come up with enough

09:58.640 --> 10:00.141
in time to pay.

10:00.225 --> 10:02.477
So it looks like we're gonna be moving.

10:02.644 --> 10:05.480
Yeah, well, I guess these things happen

10:05.563 --> 10:07.399
when you leave stuff laying around and...

10:07.482 --> 10:10.318
-Did you say moving?
-Moving? Moving to where?

10:10.735 --> 10:12.904
Back to the trailer park, I reckon.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.906
Trailer park, eh?

10:14.989 --> 10:17.158
Well, just happened to have
an article on one just

10:17.242 --> 10:18.910
north of downtown Borneo!

10:20.412 --> 10:23.665
Goofy, this is-- This is terrible.

10:23.748 --> 10:27.252
Oh, it won't be so bad.
Why, in a year or two

10:27.335 --> 10:29.963
we might even have enough
money to buy a trailer.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.049
You're not moving to any trailer park.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.050
You'll live here with us.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.677
Yeah, this is all real terrible.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.721
Now, you start off like
you're heading to Saskatchewan,

10:37.804 --> 10:39.556
only you hang a left at the equator...

10:40.974 --> 10:43.935
And what did you say?

10:47.605 --> 10:49.774
I appreciate your offer, Peg,

10:49.858 --> 10:52.610
But me and Maxie wouldn't
want to be a burden.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.112
Well, I don't want you to, either.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.489
Honey, Goofer's got too much character

10:56.573 --> 10:58.575
to mooch off his friends!

10:58.658 --> 11:02.203
He'll only be staying until he gets
back on his feet.

11:02.287 --> 11:05.373
Now, peach pit, we couldn't
impose our hospitality on them like that,

11:05.457 --> 11:08.001
so let me draw him a map to Borneo, and...

11:08.084 --> 11:11.046
Well, Peg, if you insist,

11:11.129 --> 11:14.424
I guess we could stay here a while,
but only a day or two.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.551
Oh, then it's settled.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.553
Kids, go help bring their things over.

11:18.762 --> 11:23.475
[sniffs] I just don't deserve
neighbors like you.

11:23.558 --> 11:26.269
My sentiments presactly.

11:27.062 --> 11:29.481
Oh, I can't have that Goof-monger

11:29.564 --> 11:31.441
polluting the sanity of my own home!

11:31.524 --> 11:34.486
I'll end up feeding him, and clothing him,

11:34.569 --> 11:36.404
and driving him to the orthodontist!

11:36.738 --> 11:40.492
Ew, just the thought of it
gives me Goof bumps.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.120
There's only one way out of this!

11:44.204 --> 11:46.664
I'm gonna have to give him
his own money back!

11:46.748 --> 11:49.793
And just when he was as good as gone.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.587
Gone? The money's gone!

11:52.671 --> 11:54.756
I could've sworn I put it in the...

11:54.839 --> 11:56.383
It's got to be somewhere.

11:56.466 --> 11:57.926
[stammering] Maybe I dropped it

11:58.009 --> 11:59.844
under the carpet, I...

11:59.928 --> 12:02.138
It could've fallen through the cracks,
it could...

12:02.222 --> 12:03.473
Wait a minute!

12:04.683 --> 12:07.185
You're starting to think like the Goof.

12:07.268 --> 12:11.439
[panting] You got to get
a hold of yourself there, Petems.

12:11.523 --> 12:12.982
Stay calm.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.527
[breathing heavily]

12:15.610 --> 12:20.281
Easy, Petey. Oh, no hyperventilizing,
get a grip.

12:20.365 --> 12:24.452
That's it. You got to set
your priorities.

12:24.536 --> 12:28.039
Okay, first thing, you gotta get him
out of the house,

12:28.123 --> 12:29.791
then you find the money,

12:29.874 --> 12:32.168
and then you get him back to his own dump.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.422
Yeah, that's it. Of course, yeah,
that'll work.

12:35.505 --> 12:36.631
That'll work, won't it?

12:36.715 --> 12:39.968
It has to work! It's got to work!
It's got to...

12:51.229 --> 12:55.150
Well, let me help you get
yourself settled in there, Goof-lips.

12:55.233 --> 12:58.069
Your couch is my couch, I always say!

12:58.153 --> 13:01.406
Well, thank you, Petey,
I'm really imbedded to you.

13:01.489 --> 13:04.075
I know you are. Now we'll...

13:04.159 --> 13:06.578
Oh, no! I just remembered!

13:06.661 --> 13:10.040
We had this couch fumigated
not three years ago.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.708
Can't put you there,

13:11.791 --> 13:13.668
might have lingering chemicals on it.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.755
What say we put you
and your kid up in the RV?

13:16.838 --> 13:19.382
It's cramped, stuffy, rank, and dank.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.884
You'll feel right at home.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.053
You're a swell kind of guy, Petey,

13:23.136 --> 13:25.555
going to all this trouble for us.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.556
Yeah, I know.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.100
[laughs] No trouble at all, Goof.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.478
Of course, you can only
stay in there till 3:00.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.397
I'm taking her out to have
the wheels maligned.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.027
Poor Max. If I don't do something,

13:39.110 --> 13:42.238
I could lose the best friend
I ever had.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.116
Well, sort of the only friend
I ever had.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.453
[growling]

13:50.246 --> 13:52.582
Are you gonna resod
the front lawn, or what?

13:52.665 --> 13:54.501
It pays 37 whole cents.

13:54.584 --> 13:58.630
Pistol, how can you think of money
at a time like this?

13:58.713 --> 14:03.051
Pistol, pistol, that's it!
You're a genius.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.719
-Of course, I'm a genius...
-Okay, we'll work

14:04.803 --> 14:06.471
twice as fast and three times as hard,

14:06.554 --> 14:08.973
and we'll make enough
money to pay for Max's house!

14:13.978 --> 14:16.940
Poopsie! You shouldn't bring such

14:17.023 --> 14:19.859
Icky-sticky trash into Mommy's house!

14:29.661 --> 14:31.579
P.J., I got a great idea!

14:31.663 --> 14:34.416
Remember what Dad said about
making 2 bucks on every buck?

14:34.708 --> 14:37.711
-Yeah.
-If we separate the cans and the paper,

14:37.794 --> 14:41.047
We'll get paid for dumping the trash
and recycling it!

14:55.145 --> 14:57.105
All unpacked, Dad.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.774
[Pete] Hello?

14:59.858 --> 15:01.651
Any Goof at home?

15:01.735 --> 15:03.528
Almost 3:00, Goofer.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.156
What say you pack up and let's
move you over to the boat.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.615
You'll like it there,

15:07.699 --> 15:09.367
it's got all the creature comforts,

15:09.451 --> 15:10.952
and a few of the creatures,

15:11.036 --> 15:13.705
and it's a good 10 feet closer
to Borneo.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.540
[screaming]

15:18.168 --> 15:19.794

15:27.510 --> 15:28.720

15:45.862 --> 15:48.156
[gasps] Color me embarrassed,

15:48.239 --> 15:50.033
do I have egg on my face
or what?

15:50.158 --> 15:52.410
Just remembered, I gotta get the old boat

15:52.494 --> 15:55.872
down to the dry-docks
for her biweekly varnishing.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.584
But don't worry, I'll set up a nice
pup tent for you

15:59.668 --> 16:01.252
right over by the fence,

16:01.336 --> 16:04.130
just a stone's throw away from Borneo.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.300
[laughs]

16:07.384 --> 16:10.428
I'm getting this Goof off my property
one inch at a time.

16:13.348 --> 16:14.557
[crashing]

16:16.142 --> 16:17.644
-Sorry, Dad.
-Yeah, excuse us.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.147
Give me that, will you?

16:21.272 --> 16:23.316
I've only read the sports page
twice.

16:23.441 --> 16:24.984
Sure thing, Dad!

16:29.447 --> 16:32.575
[sighs] Energetic little tycoons.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.704
That grimbleframming Goof's

16:35.787 --> 16:38.081
harder to get rid of than head lice!

16:38.206 --> 16:40.583
If only I hadn't lost that dough.

16:47.549 --> 16:51.928
Ooh, the answer to my prayers!

16:57.976 --> 17:00.562
All right, all right,
now pack that junk back up!

17:00.895 --> 17:03.189
You're gonna move us again, Pete?

17:03.314 --> 17:07.360
Yep, right back into
your very own dump house!

17:07.485 --> 17:10.572
On account of I found your mortgage money!

17:10.655 --> 17:13.783
Aw, I know what you're doing,
Pete, and it just won't wash.

17:13.908 --> 17:15.577
[stuttering]

17:15.660 --> 17:17.245
Huh? What're you talking about?

17:17.328 --> 17:18.663
I know you took your own money

17:18.747 --> 17:21.207
And fixed it up to look like mine.

17:21.332 --> 17:22.292
[laughs] Yeah, right.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.170
Look, Goof, trust me, I didn't do that.

17:25.295 --> 17:28.298
You're the best friend
named Pete I ever had.

17:28.423 --> 17:31.676
But I can't take free charity,
no matter how free it is.

17:32.177 --> 17:35.722
We're just gonna stay here
till I get us back off our feet.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.975
[strangling sounds]

17:44.189 --> 17:49.277
Oh, I can't believe I've got to
Goof the Goof into taking his own money.

17:49.944 --> 17:53.782
There, now he'll find the dough,
and it won't be charity.

17:53.865 --> 17:57.327
And I can get him off my property
and out of my hair.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.079
-[Goofy] Pete?
-Ah!

17:59.162 --> 18:02.290
Oh, the Goofmeister, there you are!

18:02.374 --> 18:04.459
Been looking for you, buddy.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.961
I just got hit by a brainstorm,

18:07.045 --> 18:08.046
and I couldn't wait to tell you.

18:08.129 --> 18:09.756
You know, Goof,

18:09.839 --> 18:13.218
A lot of cashola can accumulize
under your couch cushions

18:13.301 --> 18:15.470
Over the decades.
You ought to check it out.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.305
Thanks for the tip,

18:17.347 --> 18:19.933
But I just sold it off for 5 bucks.

18:20.016 --> 18:20.850
You what?

18:23.311 --> 18:24.771
Wanted to pay you back that lunch money

18:24.896 --> 18:26.272
You loaned me in high school.

18:28.149 --> 18:31.194
Stop, stop, come back here,
come back!

18:32.570 --> 18:34.239
[exhausted panting]

18:36.741 --> 18:38.910
Getting that guy back in his house

18:38.993 --> 18:41.162
is gonna get me in traction.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.334
If I don't get that nut out of here,

18:46.376 --> 18:49.045
I'm gonna be a shell of my former self.

18:51.673 --> 18:55.135
P.J., grab those socks!
Darning runs 25 cents a hole!

18:55.218 --> 18:56.803
And get the jacket.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.596
I'll bet you a double scoop of fudge nut

18:58.680 --> 19:01.433
with sliced almonds and jelly bean sauce
I finish before you!

19:01.516 --> 19:04.978
Ice cream. Why didn't I
think of that sooner?

19:05.186 --> 19:08.690
I know how to get the money back to the...

19:10.150 --> 19:13.361
Money, money, money, where's the money?

19:28.877 --> 19:31.087
P.J., give me that coat!

19:33.298 --> 19:35.467
Who made off with my moolah?

19:36.134 --> 19:38.720
I'm gonna lose my mind
if I don't do something!

19:38.803 --> 19:44.184
[gasping] I'll never get rid of him
unless I use my own...

19:44.267 --> 19:46.186
[gasps] Money!

19:46.269 --> 19:47.896
[gasps]

19:59.157 --> 20:02.410
Goof, I know you've had your eye
on my ice cream maker,

20:02.535 --> 20:03.953
so tell you what I'm gonna do,

20:04.037 --> 20:06.748
I'll sell it to you
at twice its retail value,

20:06.873 --> 20:09.125
A mere 400 big ones.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.711
Oh, it's a fine piece of machinery, Pete.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.589
But I'm afraid my cash flow
is at low tide.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.509
No problem. I'll float you a loan,

20:17.592 --> 20:19.844
And you write me out a U-O-me.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.930
Well, okey-doke, Pete.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.560
Fine, here's your 400 simoleons.

20:28.436 --> 20:31.064
And here's 400 for the ice cream maker.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.316
Okay, now we're...

20:34.818 --> 20:37.028
Ooh, ah!

20:38.947 --> 20:40.615
Uh, uh, say, Goof,

20:40.699 --> 20:42.200
Can you break a 10 for me?

20:42.283 --> 20:45.453
Sorry, Pete, only got change
for a three.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.664
That's okay. If you give me three,

20:47.747 --> 20:50.500
I'll give you 10 back,
and you can owe me the rest.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.544
Now I don't have a five,
so let me give you these three twenties.

20:52.627 --> 20:53.753
Now, four is 12 is 129,

20:53.837 --> 20:55.547
you carry that to the fifth dimension,

20:55.630 --> 20:58.133
round it off to the nearest fraction
makes it 270, am I right?

20:58.258 --> 21:01.803
Uh, I never had much
of a head for figures.

21:01.928 --> 21:05.306
I know. What am I thinking?
I still owe you for the seven.

21:05.390 --> 21:08.184
Compounded quarterly, that makes it 375.

21:08.309 --> 21:09.728
And, you know, I'm a little short,

21:09.811 --> 21:11.896
so you better take this 82 as collateral.

21:12.022 --> 21:13.023
And there! We're even!

21:14.024 --> 21:15.150
We are?

21:15.442 --> 21:18.361
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,
we finished all the chores, 15 times each,

21:18.445 --> 21:20.530
and minus room and board
and all the usual taxes,

21:20.655 --> 21:22.449
you owe me 219 big ones!

21:22.574 --> 21:25.160
And 181 for me.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.579
[Peg] that's right, my little mutual fund.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.122
I checked the figures myself.

Well, would you look-y here!

21:43.803 --> 21:48.350
Ahyuck. It's my mortgage money,
all $400!

21:48.433 --> 21:51.519
Ahyuck. Well, maybe you'll need more,

21:51.603 --> 21:53.980
why take chances? Here's another 100.

21:54.105 --> 21:56.483
Oh, don't want to cut it too close,
take an extra 50...

21:56.566 --> 21:58.902
Nah, just take the whole wallet,
and this ring,

21:59.027 --> 22:01.696
and here's my car keys,
and my Italian shoes,

22:01.780 --> 22:03.823
