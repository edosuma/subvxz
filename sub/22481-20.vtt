WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.570
HONDO:
Previously on S.W.A.T...

00:02.636 --> 00:05.906
We're targeting
a huge fentanyl operation
being run out of Koreatown.

00:05.973 --> 00:08.409
DISTORTED VOICE: If you want
your son back alive,
you'll meet us alone.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.079
I knew you'd come.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.846
The real top dog who
kidnapped Walsh's son

00:12.913 --> 00:14.782
isn't even in
custody. Jae Kim.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.917
Officer, there's obviously
some sort of misunderstanding.

00:16.984 --> 00:20.054
You went after
a mother and son
who are like family to me.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.919
WALSH:
He tried to do a full day
back at school last week.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.487
Wasn't ready.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.023
Well, getting kidnapped,
your life threatened,

00:56.090 --> 00:57.991
a knife held to your neck
will mess you up a little bit.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.760
It's just gonna take him
a little time to bounce back.

00:59.827 --> 01:02.363
He's doing fine. I'm the
one that wasn't ready.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.466
Haven't been able to let him
out of my sight since then.

01:05.533 --> 01:06.967
It's not healthy.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.103
I got to let him start
being a kid again,

01:09.170 --> 01:13.274
but Jae Kim turned
our lives inside out.

01:13.341 --> 01:14.442
Okay, listen to me.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.310
We are very close
to taking him down.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.478
We just need that final piece.

01:17.545 --> 01:20.148
We don't have one by now,
maybe we never will.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.849
We are close, K.C.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.551
Kim buttoned up his
fentanyl operation,

01:23.617 --> 01:25.286
but he's gonna have to
dip back in sooner or later.

01:25.353 --> 01:28.356
And when he does,
we're gonna be there.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.324
WALSH: And who's the new guy
he's meeting with?

01:30.391 --> 01:32.560
We don't have a name yet,
but his car is registered
to the county.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.128
He doesn't look like
a big shot.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.997
Maybe it's not about him,
but what he can access.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.432
Either way,
I aim to find out.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.476
You said there were three.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.678
My fault,
I guess there are four.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.112
You need to learn
to keep track.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.014
Kitchen knives need
to stay together.
KAREN: Oh.

01:54.081 --> 01:57.117
I guess I'd better
get rid of the shank
I stashed in the bathroom.

01:58.186 --> 02:00.688
Hey, listen.
You saw for yourself.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.557
My weapons are all secure.
We got the gun safe.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.159
We're following
all the regulations.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.394
We really need
to go over cutlery?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.362
I just... I got
to get to work.

02:08.429 --> 02:11.199
Oh, have your supervisor
sign this while you're there.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.566
STREET: Oh.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.235
I thought I could just
loop 'em in verbally.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.503
Skip the formality.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.371
Uh, nothing about parole's
a formality.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.872
L.A.P.D. needs to know
if there's an officer

02:18.939 --> 02:20.274
residing with
a convicted felon.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.909
Got it.
It's not a problem, ma'am.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.511
It is until I get
that signature.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.446
The judge wanted me
to be perfectly clear.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.181
Don't expect favors
because you're a cop.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.849
I'm sorry.
Were you doing me

02:28.916 --> 02:30.150
some kind of favor
that I missed?

02:30.218 --> 02:32.186
If your mother violates
parole while living...

02:32.253 --> 02:33.921
KAREN:
It's clear.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.756
Perfectly, ma'am.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.562
No alcohol.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.631
Same thing goes
for contraband,
obviously.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.733
And if you're planning
on leaving Los Angeles County,

02:45.799 --> 02:47.201
I need you
to notify me at least...

02:47.268 --> 02:49.002
Well, I know, after 18 years,

02:49.069 --> 02:53.006
I'm sure there's plenty
to do here in this county.

02:53.073 --> 02:56.444
That changes,
notify me through the app
three days prior to travel.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.246
See you next week, Karen.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.014
Okay.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.883
I'm sorry the fridge
is so bare.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.385
I did leave you some cash
by your phone

03:04.452 --> 03:06.554
if you want to get a bite
while you're out job hunting.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.121
My pho... I don't know
where my phone is.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.358
Ma, it's... It's charging
by your bed.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.027
No, Jimmy, it's
your bed. Okay?

03:14.094 --> 03:15.629
I still don't feel
right about this.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.231
I... I'm gonna sleep
on the couch.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.866
I mean, I... I know that
I'm a burden to you.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.200
I can feel it.
Ma.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.970
Ma. Listen.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.306
This is a fresh start
for both of us.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.875
Have a great day, okay?

03:27.941 --> 03:29.577
Hmm.
Okay?

03:29.643 --> 03:31.111
Okay.
Okay.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.758
Here you go, man.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.059
Go ahead.
Thanks.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.731
Health Department?

03:51.532 --> 03:52.733
Property Assessment.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.505
You're, um...

03:57.571 --> 03:59.473
Forgive me, I'm blanking.
Uh, remind me.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.074
Ian Peck.
Ah.

04:01.141 --> 04:02.276
We meet before?

04:02.343 --> 04:04.512
No, no. We have
a mutual friend.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.914
Oh.
Jae Kim.

04:08.716 --> 04:12.152
You're, uh,
in real estate, too?

04:12.219 --> 04:14.154
I have an unfinished
project with Kim.

04:14.221 --> 04:16.123
Sounds much more lucrative
than my line of work.

04:16.189 --> 04:17.625
Public sector.

04:17.691 --> 04:18.759
Me, too.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.862
L.A.P.D.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.833
You want to tell me what
you got cooking with Kim?

04:25.899 --> 04:29.370
He owns property.
I assess its value,
so we've crossed paths.

04:29.437 --> 04:30.971
How often do you meet
with developers on Sundays

04:31.038 --> 04:32.573
in deserted
construction sites?

04:34.207 --> 04:36.744
'Cause that seems pretty
damn suspicious to me.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.846
It was just a simple meeting.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.448
So if I was to dig
into your bank statements,

04:40.514 --> 04:42.983
I wouldn't see
any wire transfers
from Kim to you?

04:43.050 --> 04:44.585
Any unexplained cash
hitting your account?

04:46.920 --> 04:48.689
Loyal till the end, huh?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.458
All right, I get it,
Kim's the money.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.460
I'm a guy you just met
in a men's bathroom.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.227
I mean, what's he doing?

04:54.294 --> 04:56.830
Setting you up with his stable
of a-thousand-dollar-an-hour
lawyers?

04:56.897 --> 04:59.700
I mean, he's got to be.
I mean, why else would you be
headed down this road?

04:59.767 --> 05:01.902
I don't have any lawyers.
You don't?

05:01.969 --> 05:04.338
Do you really think
that some public defender's

05:04.405 --> 05:06.073
gonna keep you
from doing hard time?

05:06.139 --> 05:08.075
Hard time?

05:08.141 --> 05:10.243
If anyone should be doing
hard time, it's...

05:11.679 --> 05:12.846
Listen.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.048
Kim is not just some...

05:15.115 --> 05:18.886
No, no. It is impossible
to tie him to anything.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.220
He's too connected.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.089
Not for me, he's not.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.025
Kim's gonna screw you
the next time he needs to,
and if he doesn't, I will.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.595
So why not screw him first?

05:28.796 --> 05:30.931
His name's plastered
on buildings.

05:30.998 --> 05:34.502
He wins awards.
He... He cuts ribbons.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.370
But no one knows
how bad he really is.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.339
Oh, I do. Trust me, I do.

05:39.407 --> 05:42.075
I just need proof.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.777
WALSH:
So what's Peck handing over?

05:43.844 --> 05:45.979
Forged deeds, permits,
you name it, K.C.

05:46.046 --> 05:49.617
That Pico Corridor project
was just Kim's latest scam,
apparently.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.553
Peck forged documents
to overvalue his property?

05:52.620 --> 05:54.422
Shouldn't it be
the other way around?

05:54.488 --> 05:56.457
Well, my guess is,
when Kim put Pico Corridor
up as collateral,

05:56.524 --> 05:59.727
he needed to make sure
it was enough to secure
a $25 million loan.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.194
He was hard up for cash

06:01.261 --> 06:03.063
after we made that
fentanyl bust, but that loan,

06:03.130 --> 06:04.331
it comes due tomorrow.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.967
So, what do we nail Kim on?
Real estate fraud?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.335
He deserves to go away
for far worse,

06:08.402 --> 06:10.070
but he's been sitting
on the rest of his fentanyl
supply

06:10.137 --> 06:11.539
since that bust.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.840
So this might be
our best chance

06:12.906 --> 06:14.808
to put
that son of a bitch away
for a decade or more.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.444
When do you want
to go public with this?

06:16.510 --> 06:19.680
L.A.P.D. might not
be so thrilled we found
something they couldn't.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.248
Off the books
doesn't mean illegal.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.316
A smoking gun is still
a smoking gun, K.C.,
and trust me,

06:23.383 --> 06:24.818
they'll be happy
to have the bust.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.120
Even if it's uncovered
by a retired DEA agent

06:27.187 --> 06:29.122
and an off
Even then.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.091
Peck says to meet him
at the diner in an hour.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.862
Hondo, are you all right?

06:37.931 --> 06:39.232
Hondo!

07:55.242 --> 07:57.377
CORTEZ: Thank God
you're all right.
You got cut up.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.046
I'm still standing.
Atta boy.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.381
I'm Hondo.
John Burrows, RHD.

08:01.448 --> 08:02.916
You want to run me
through what went down?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.185
A car pulled up over there
by the stoplight.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.588
I could tell something was off
with these three
before they opened fire,

08:07.655 --> 08:10.758
so I punched the gas
and we ended up over there.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.226
I got out and I dropped the
first shooter with two rounds.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.395
The driver took a bullet
to the shoulder,
but he kept his feet

08:15.462 --> 08:17.531
and he fled east
with the second shooter.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.366
Here's the shell casings.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.235
Kimber's on its way
to evidence.
Some kind of road rage thing?

08:22.302 --> 08:24.572
No, this was a planned hit
and I know who was behind it.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.041
Jae Kim.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.778
The mogul developer guy?
That's right.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.880
I've been digging into Kim
on my free time.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.048
We've been doing
surveillance on him.
Who's we?

08:35.115 --> 08:36.650
Me and K.C. Walsh.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.086
Retired DEA Agent Walsh?
HICKS: I told you
three months ago

08:39.152 --> 08:42.155
to leave the investigating
to Narcotics.
And I did.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.257
But when I checked back in,
they hadn't moved the ball
an inch.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.425
What about you, sir?

08:45.492 --> 08:46.994
Did you follow up with them
in any of this?

08:47.060 --> 08:48.528
No, you didn't.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.898
I handed you and Narcotics
Kim on a silver platter

08:50.964 --> 08:53.601
and nobody did nothing,
so I decided to.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.103
And how would
your little hobby look
if we were responding

08:56.169 --> 08:57.571
to an officer
killed call here?

08:57.638 --> 08:59.807
I didn't let that happen.
Okay.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.775
Get cleaned up
and head back to HQ.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.311
HQ? No. You're not pulling me
off this right now, sir.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.580
You're both our victim
and our only witness,

09:06.647 --> 09:08.081
so you're not staying
in the field.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.283
Hondo, you know
the protocol.
Waive it.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.786
So you can keep playing
cowboy? Denied.

09:12.853 --> 09:16.023
Get whatever intel you have
to Burrows and assist from HQ.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.163
Glad you're okay, boss.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.698
Yo, who did this?

09:24.765 --> 09:26.566
Do you remember the guy
behind the kidnapping of
K.C. Walsh's son?

09:26.634 --> 09:28.936
What, Jae Kim? The...
The rich developer dude?

09:29.002 --> 09:30.303
Fentanyl ring went down,
Kim never did.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.739
How do you know he did this?

09:31.805 --> 09:34.041
I kept digging into his
businesses and clearly
I hit a nerve.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.342
He sent his goons after me.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.744
Look, I need your help.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.812
Did you hear anything
on the way over here
that we can use?

09:38.879 --> 09:40.180
Gun and vehicle
are scrubbed.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.649
No ID on the dead shooter.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.751
He got any ink?
Wolf head on
his shoulder blade.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.518
Profetas.
Yeah, definitely
the Profetas.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.854
Are they still
in Boyle Heights?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.388
They got caught
up in a turf war,
moved to South Gate.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.457
Well, wherever they are,
the driver's got a bullet
in his shoulder,

09:50.523 --> 09:51.524
so he ain't getting too far.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.794
All right, look.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.829
Hicks wants me anchored at HQ.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.497
Street, there's a box
in my den at my house.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.366
You take Chris with you,
you get it to Burrows.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.234
He's running point for RHD.
All right.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.671
These Profetas, how do you
want us to go after 'em?

10:03.737 --> 10:06.473
The enemy of your enemy is
never a bad place to start.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.742
MAN: Know what I'm saying? So
it's not considered snitching.
WOMAN: No?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.946
Hey, Roscoe.
I know you?

10:13.013 --> 10:14.782
Busted your brother
last year.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.416
What's that got
to do with me?
New girl?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.452
ROSCOE:
Was about to find out.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.989
I didn't do anything
to deserve this parade, so
why y'all bothering me, dawg?

10:22.055 --> 10:24.725
You know anything about
an attempted hit on a cop
about a mile that way?

10:24.792 --> 10:28.195
Nope. Nope.
I've been here all day, dawg.
You can ask anybody.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.597
Well, we got reason to think
Los Profetas were involved.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.667
Now, do I look like a freaking
Los Profetas to you?
More like a One-Niner.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.869
Profetas have been
moving in on you and
your crew, haven't they?

10:35.936 --> 10:37.404
There's been some
encroachment, yeah.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.206
So it wouldn't be
the worst thing if they
happened to get raided.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.507
Raided?
DEACON: By us.

10:40.573 --> 10:43.043
Today. You tell us
where they might
be posted up,

10:43.110 --> 10:45.846
you give us some good intel
on what we might find that's
good enough for a judge...

10:45.913 --> 10:46.980
And we take 'em down.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.849
Now hold on,
let me get this straight.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.851
Y'all came
all the way down here
just to give me the chance

10:50.918 --> 10:52.519
to make some Los Profetas
miserable?

10:54.321 --> 10:57.290
Hell.
Why didn't y'all just say so?

10:57.357 --> 10:59.059
BURROWS:
Photos, dates.

10:59.126 --> 11:02.095
Sergeant Harrelson documented
a dozen after-hours meetings

11:02.162 --> 11:05.298
Kim had over
the last two months.
It's so thorough.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.466
Hondo doesn't do half-assed.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.635
Is there enough here
to charge Kim?

11:08.702 --> 11:10.203
Well, the time codes
on these wire transfers

11:10.270 --> 11:11.739
match up with most
of Hondo's meeting log,

11:11.805 --> 11:13.606
but there's nothing
we could prosecute for, yet.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.543
And there is no sign
of this Ian Peck
at that diner.

11:19.612 --> 11:22.582
Hey, uh, think Hondo
might've got too deep here?

11:22.649 --> 11:24.151
I think Kim has no clue
who he's messed with.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.288
Something wrong?

11:32.292 --> 11:33.827
Hey.

11:33.894 --> 11:37.430
Eighteen years really
is a long time. This place
is really the future.

11:37.497 --> 11:40.400
All you need is, like,
flying cars.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.469
What are you doing here?
How did you get inside?

11:42.535 --> 11:45.138
Oh, the guy at the front
is a bit of a talker...
So, guess what.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.941
One of the jobs
that I applied for,
they called,

11:48.008 --> 11:50.143
and they want
to meet me, today.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.679
* Your mama is
still employable *

11:52.746 --> 11:53.981
STREET: That is great,

11:54.047 --> 11:55.115
but you can't just
show up here

11:55.182 --> 11:56.416
and scam your way
inside the building,

11:56.483 --> 11:58.585
I mean, I could get
in serious trouble for this.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.821
I... I didn't think
that visiting my son
was a scam.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.890
I... I just wanted
to see where you work.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.058
I mean, I didn't
lie or anything.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.060
You're just out on parole.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.662
It's not really a good look
for me right now, that's all.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.932
Okay.

12:11.999 --> 12:15.102
Well, um...

12:15.168 --> 12:17.470
I brought you this, because
you need to have it signed,

12:17.537 --> 12:20.607
And you know, I mean,
I don't want to cause
any trouble for you.

12:20.673 --> 12:21.975
STREET: Okay,
thank you.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.443
So...

12:23.510 --> 12:25.378
So should I leave that way?
Yeah.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.546
That'd be great.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.826
MAN: I put one of those
stereos in my car, man.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.160
It sounds great.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.662
L.A.P.D.!
Get on the ground now!
L.A.P.D.! S.W.A.T.!

12:42.729 --> 12:44.564
Don't move! Don't move!
TAN: A Code 4 here!

12:44.631 --> 12:45.698
LUCA: Right side clear!

12:45.765 --> 12:46.967
TAN: Give me a two!
LUCA: Two!

12:47.034 --> 12:48.668
DEACON: Looks like stolen
stereo equipment.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.804
LUCA: Ride side clear!
TAN: Got a wounded
suspect in here.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.272
DEACON: I'll get
an R/A rolling.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.007
Let me see those
pearly yellows.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.208
Get that thing out of my face.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.743
Where's the other guy?
Don't know no other guy.

12:56.810 --> 13:00.047
The shooter
that got away, Gabriel.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.915
It's time for you to talk.
GABRIEL: Go to hell.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.683
Hey.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.752
Know the cop that you guys
tried to kill this morning?

13:05.819 --> 13:07.720
The bad news is
he's not dead.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.357
Worse news is,
he just ID'd you
as the getaway driver.

13:10.423 --> 13:13.160
One shooter's dead,
and if you're the only
guy on trial...

13:13.226 --> 13:14.461
I didn't shoot at no cop.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.762
The driver is just
as responsible

13:15.829 --> 13:17.164
as the guys slinging
the bullets,

13:17.230 --> 13:19.699
so unless you know where
the missing shooter is...

13:22.802 --> 13:23.937
Diego Perez.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.740
Big guy, gold teeth.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.742
I picked him
up last night.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.211
He came in from Vegas
to pull the job.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.679
Contract killer?

13:32.745 --> 13:33.881
Kim's trying to keep clean.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.648
Kim

13:37.918 --> 13:39.853
WALSH:
So he tries to kill you,

13:39.920 --> 13:41.721
but we still don't have enough
to make an arrest?

13:41.788 --> 13:43.490
We will, K.C. Listen.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.225
That $25 million dollar loan
Kim took out,

13:45.292 --> 13:47.527
there's something
I can put into motion.
Loan?

13:47.594 --> 13:48.896
We need to find Peck.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.564
He's the one
with the Pico Corridor papers.

13:51.631 --> 13:54.034
That's what's gonna
put Kim away
and keep Calvin safe.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.502
Look, just hang tight,
all right?

13:55.568 --> 13:57.170
I got the rest of my team
working on this,
let us do our thing.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.875
APB's out on Diego Perez,
haven't gotten a hit yet.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.077
He's probably got an alias.
Maybe we can get Rocker

14:04.144 --> 14:06.813
to put some pressure
on our driver once
he's out of surgery.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.882
I grounded you.
Where you going?

14:08.949 --> 14:10.884
CAPO unit needs me to sign
a statement over in Legal.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.352
Ah, right, right, right, okay.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.221
Well, give Marty my best.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.422
Then get back here.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.432
Hey, there he is.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.534
Thanks for coming.
Have a seat.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.004
About that paperwork...

14:32.072 --> 14:33.440
HONDO:
Excuse me, ma'am.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.841
You Carolyn Shaw?
Mmm-hmm.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.643
VP of Corporate Loans?
What's this about, Officer?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.278
It's, uh, Sergeant,
actually.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.948
I just have a question
about your clients, Jae Kim.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.984
If your bank was to
loan him $25 million,

14:44.051 --> 14:45.552
you'd be the one to
sign off on it, right?

14:45.618 --> 14:47.387
Well, I don't discuss
individual clients...

14:47.454 --> 14:49.089
Look, I shouldn't
tell you this,

14:49.156 --> 14:51.324
but before you get
more wrapped up
in the Jae Kim business,

14:51.391 --> 14:53.626
I think you should know
he's under investigation.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.328
Investigation for what?

14:55.395 --> 14:56.663
Money laundering,
drug trafficking,

14:56.729 --> 14:58.665
attempted murder of a police
officer, take your pick.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.568
Now, I'm not supposed to
do this favor for you.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.703
I could really get in a lot of
trouble warning you like this,

15:03.770 --> 15:06.239
but I'd hate to see
his problems drag
your bank down with him.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.441
I can't believe it,
I was just about to approve

15:08.508 --> 15:10.110
an extension
on his loan payment.

15:10.177 --> 15:13.513
Well, I'm no banker,
but I'd think twice
before you do that.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.182
Kim's going down.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.584
You didn't hear
that from me.
Thank you.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.885
Have a nice day.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.256
Yeah, it's me.

15:25.558 --> 15:26.926
You told me...

15:28.128 --> 15:29.997
He looks really pissed.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.699
Yeah, I'm guessing
he's just found out he's gonna
have to pay back that loan

15:32.765 --> 15:34.167
by tomorrow morning.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.435
CHRIS: So what
Hondo's next move?

15:49.216 --> 15:50.550
Roll the back window
down, please.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.056
You remember me?

15:57.991 --> 16:00.227
The officer who dropped in
on one of my meetings
a while back.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.694
Sure, I remember.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.230
I never did get your name.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.399
It's Daniel Harrelson,
S.W.A.T.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.168
Just wondering how your
day is going so far.

16:09.736 --> 16:13.273
You really shouldn't meddle
in another person's
private business.

16:13.340 --> 16:16.109
Yeah, maybe you should've
taken your own advice
four months ago.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.344
I just want you to know,

16:17.410 --> 16:18.645
the next time
we see each other,

16:18.711 --> 16:19.912
you will be wearing cuffs.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.017
I hope you enjoy
the time you have left.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.525
Peck's county car
has a parking pass,

16:32.592 --> 16:34.261
and building's owned
by one of Kim's LLCs.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.595
The guy's on Kim's payroll.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.830
Seems like Sergeant Harrelson
was onto something.

16:41.734 --> 16:42.902
DEACON:
That him?

16:46.139 --> 16:48.208
Ian Peck.
Okay, that's not good.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.343
Somebody's still here.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.449
K.C.?

16:57.617 --> 16:58.651
No.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.721
I... I found him like that.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.390
Against the wall.

17:03.456 --> 17:06.226
I was gonna call it in,
I just hadn't had
a chance to do...

17:06.293 --> 17:07.594
Now.
Wait a second.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.928
What...

17:18.805 --> 17:22.242
Did Peck come after you?
Did you kill him in
self

17:22.309 --> 17:25.278
You were found alone
with the victim,
you didn't call it in.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.579
You were there illegally.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.181
We found you
searching the place.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.649
How do you explain that?

17:29.716 --> 17:31.784
I got his address,
I went there to get the papers

17:31.851 --> 17:35.088
he said would incriminate
Jae Kim and I found him dead.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.489
I was gonna call it in,

17:36.556 --> 17:39.126
but I wanted to see
if the paperwork
was still there first.

17:39.192 --> 17:42.195
I shouldn't have
done it, but...

17:45.165 --> 17:46.766
She didn't kill him.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.968
I understand
why you believe that, but
that's not how it looks.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.204
Kim made sure K.C.
came across Peck's address.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.640
And I don't know how,
but he set her up
to get to me.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.975
If that's true,
traipsing around L.A.

17:56.042 --> 17:59.179
with your moonlighting gal pal
put her in that chair,

17:59.246 --> 18:02.014
and got us no closer
to nailing Kim than
we were in the first place.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.384
You know what
guilty looks like,

18:04.451 --> 18:06.085
and you know
she didn't kill that guy.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.921
I'm homicide. On the
scale of mysteries,
this isn't much of one.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.290
Walsh was in the
room with the body.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.024
Why would
she want to kill Peck?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.860
He was our key
to taking Kim down.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.496
You want to prove it
was someone else?
Prove it was someone else.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.765
I know you think
this real estate guy
is behind all this...

18:18.831 --> 18:21.000
Real estate's his shell, man.

18:21.067 --> 18:24.171
Kim oversees one of
the biggest drug operations
in the city.

18:24.237 --> 18:27.106
Half the civic leaders in town
send Kim Christmas cards.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.942
Need more than your opinion
to take on a guy
that plugged in.

18:30.009 --> 18:32.845
He's right. I've never
gotten calls like I have
in the past few hours.

18:32.912 --> 18:33.946
Me, either.
From who?

18:34.013 --> 18:35.548
People with pull at City Hall.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.651
Oh, come on, that's just Kim
calling in favors,
trying to shut me down.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.520
Or maybe he feels like
you got a vendetta,

18:40.587 --> 18:42.489
and haven't exactly been
following the rules.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.124
If I give Marty
in Legal a call,

18:45.192 --> 18:47.394
is he gonna confirm that you
stopped by his office earlier?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.364
I know when I'm getting
the runaround.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.366
From you and Walsh.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.067
So let me be clear.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.270
You're locked in the building
till we get to the bottom
of this.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.676
I know how close
you are to K.C.,

19:03.743 --> 19:05.712
but she doesn't have
a badge anymore, Hondo.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.180
And that's why I needed
to help her.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.182
Kim being free is messing
with her and her son...

19:09.249 --> 19:10.350
He's my godson.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.018
You sure no lines got crossed?

19:12.084 --> 19:13.753
Nothing Hicks
can get you for?

19:13.820 --> 19:16.189
Are you asking me
if I got my hands dirty?

19:16.256 --> 19:18.225
I think I kept them
clean enough.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.660
I thought we had trust.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.063
Why didn't you tell me
what you were doing?

19:24.130 --> 19:25.898
We do have trust.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.767
Maybe I thought
I was protecting you.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.907
Rocker sure about this?

19:34.974 --> 19:37.410
Well, he said our getaway
driver's amnesia lifted

19:37.477 --> 19:39.011
as soon he woke up
handcuffed to the bed.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.314
And our second
shooter's traveling
under a different name.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.615
But still a big guy
with a goatee?

19:42.682 --> 19:45.084
Big guy, goatee and
a bus ticket to Vegas.

19:49.656 --> 19:50.957
That our guy?

19:54.093 --> 19:55.528
Hey.
DEACON: Hey!

20:07.039 --> 20:08.441
Give me your hands!

20:08.508 --> 20:09.942
Give me your hands.
Puta.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.244
Shut up.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.312
Got him?

20:14.947 --> 20:16.349
How much do you
think is in there?

20:16.416 --> 20:18.117
Got to be 15 large.
20.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.253
What's that, the going rate
for killing cops?

20:22.489 --> 20:23.956
Here you go, kid.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.229
What happened to your face?

20:30.297 --> 20:31.998
I just got in a
little fender bender.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.266
It's nothing.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.134
Why'd the police
come and pick me up?

20:35.201 --> 20:36.536
What's my mom
doing back there?

20:36.603 --> 20:38.104
Well, since your
grandmother's in Colorado,

20:38.170 --> 20:39.972
your mom asked me to send
a couple guys to pick you up

20:40.039 --> 20:41.541
while she answers
a few questions.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.510
Why can't I see her?
As soon as she's
done helping us

20:43.576 --> 20:44.844
with our case, you can.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.779
I thought she was retired.
She is.

20:46.846 --> 20:50.049
But this particular case
is really important to your
mom, and we need her help.

20:54.186 --> 20:56.956
Hey, how about you quit
with the 20 Questions,

20:57.023 --> 20:59.359
you make me look good
and start your grammar.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.960
You know your
mom's-a wring
my neck

21:01.027 --> 21:02.362
if she thinks
I'm letting you slack.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.130
And eat.

21:04.196 --> 21:05.698
Eat.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.936
You're a hell of a godfather.

21:10.903 --> 21:11.938
Kid makes it easy.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.673
Is there anything
we can do for him?

21:13.740 --> 21:16.309
Just keep it a regular day
until we figure out
how to get K.C. out of this.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.277
Speaking of that,
come with me.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.153
Hondo, I heard what happened.
I'm glad you're okay.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.121
I appreciate that,
Commissioner.

21:29.188 --> 21:31.658
A few months ago, Michael
got a call from Jae Kim.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.526
He said a S.W.A.T.
officer showed up

21:33.593 --> 21:36.295
at an investor meeting
and stepped over the line.

21:36.363 --> 21:39.298
Kim said he felt threatened,
asked me to look
into the situation.

21:39.366 --> 21:42.402
I told Kim if he came after
K.C. Walsh or her son again,

21:42.469 --> 21:45.538
I was gonna pay him a visit.
Nothing more to the situation.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.306
Are you sure?

21:47.374 --> 21:48.675
'Cause when I checked
in with Narcotics,

21:48.741 --> 21:50.477
they said you got pretty
heated with them, too.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.811
For not taking Jae Kim down.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.382
So when I spoke
to Kim again, he said...

21:55.448 --> 21:58.851
Wait a minute.
Again

21:58.918 --> 22:01.253
Hold up, are you the
reason Kim knew I was
looking into him

22:01.320 --> 22:03.723
for the past couple of months?
The reason
I got shot at today?

22:03.790 --> 22:05.492
That's not what I intended.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.794
I never would've spoken to Kim
if there was an
actual investigation,

22:07.860 --> 22:09.862
but apparently this was you
and an ex-federal agent

22:09.929 --> 22:11.030
looking into things
on your own?

22:11.097 --> 22:12.164
I didn't know about it.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.166
Why should you?
You sit on an oversight board.

22:14.233 --> 22:15.702
You don't work in the field.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.604
Doesn't mean you get
to walk into a boardroom
and threaten someone.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.338
I didn't threaten him.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.073
I know a some people
who were there. Sounded
like threats to them.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.875
I know you're smart enough
not to break the rules,

22:22.942 --> 22:24.411
but don't tell me
you didn't bend them here.

22:24.477 --> 22:26.813
Jae Kim was behind
the kidnapping
of a ten-year-old boy.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.314
If you could prove that,
he'd be behind bars.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.783
Or maybe he just has
too many friends like you
covering his ass.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.285
Come on,
Commissioner.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.121
Don't even try to play
like you haven't heard
the rumors of Kim being dirty.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.257
We've had a few business
dealings in the past,
but we're hardly friends.

22:38.324 --> 22:39.892
As for rumors,
they're rumors.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.761
You try working
in construction without
dealing with someone

22:41.828 --> 22:44.464
who's a little questionable.
You'd never build anything.

22:44.531 --> 22:47.266
The only thing I'm trying
to build here, sir...
Both of you need to stop.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.403
Michael, Kim tried
to have Hondo killed.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.739
Hondo,
Michael's not the enemy.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.607
We need to get
on the same page.

22:54.674 --> 22:55.842
Yeah, and what page is that?

23:05.151 --> 23:06.553
You recognize him?

23:06.619 --> 23:09.121
Bag of cash came
from somewhere.
Want to tell us who paid you?

23:09.188 --> 23:10.557
Nice profit for
an unfinished job.

23:10.623 --> 23:11.824
Who asked you
to take me out?

23:13.325 --> 23:14.994
I recognize you.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.930
You pulled a SIG P228.

23:17.997 --> 23:21.934
Life gets real bad
when you go at a cop,

23:22.001 --> 23:24.471
but lucky for you, I just want
the guy who hired you.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.441
I don't know him.
Never talked to the guy.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.342
Well, that's not
good enough, Diego.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.879
Looks like you're
gonna do time for
everybody on this. Let's go.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.414
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:35.482 --> 23:36.683
Look, listen, look.
You want the guy?

23:36.749 --> 23:38.084
All right, you got him.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.520
Now you obviously got a name,
so go ahead and tell me

23:40.587 --> 23:42.354
and I'll repeat it
to whoever you want me to.

23:44.757 --> 23:46.358
Whisper a name in my ear.

23:51.664 --> 23:52.965
That's not how
we do things here.

23:57.570 --> 24:00.507
Hey. Heard Diego
wouldn't give Kim up.
Couldn't.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.875
Kim put enough layers between
'em to keep him in the clear.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.176
So why'd this hitman
still get paid?

24:04.243 --> 24:05.812
'Cause he changed his target
to Ian Peck.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.147
If Diego killed Peck,
that means K.C.'s
off the hook, right?

24:08.214 --> 24:10.550
They're getting him on the
record now, but yeah, K.C.
should get released.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.686
Great. Hey,
could we talk
for a sec?

24:13.753 --> 24:14.787
Shoot.

24:17.389 --> 24:19.992
So my mom's staying with me
since she got out,

24:20.059 --> 24:22.695
and everything's great,
but since I'm a cop,

24:22.762 --> 24:24.731
there's this form.
It's kind of a formality.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.232
I just need approval.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.802
To live with a felon.
It's not a formality.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.471
Nice try.

24:32.539 --> 24:33.906
So you're not
gonna sign for me?

24:36.342 --> 24:38.711
Look, like Annie
tells the kids,

24:38.778 --> 24:40.547
don't take three rights
to make a left.

24:41.914 --> 24:44.517
Your superior officer
needs to sign it.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.785
That's Hondo.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.125
Have you heard of
the Chandler Club?

24:53.192 --> 24:55.427
Yeah, that's that
members-only lounge downtown.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.896
Old money
L.A. dinosaurs.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.531
New money, too.
Kim's a member.

24:58.598 --> 25:00.099
He just booked a
room at the club

25:00.166 --> 25:01.768
to pitch some
high-end development

25:01.834 --> 25:03.435
on Alvarado
to investors.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.038
Oh, okay, so that $25 million
loan's due tomorrow,

25:06.105 --> 25:08.140
and he's out shaking the tree
trying to find some cash.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.209
He's desperate.
Maybe we can
turn that into a bust.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.410
How?

25:11.477 --> 25:13.379
Michael Plank
got an invitation.

25:13.445 --> 25:16.515
Plank... No, no. Hell no.
I don't trust him.

25:16.583 --> 25:17.584
Well, I do.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.889
Looks like Kim rotates
the same six properties

25:22.955 --> 25:24.791
among his LLCs
every few years.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.058
I still can't
prove it in court,

25:26.125 --> 25:27.894
but he is laundering
money for a cartel.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.996
The real estate's just a way
of hiding the drug profits.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.231
These cash injections
make no sense otherwise.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.901
Company's built
on sand.
It's built on fentanyl.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.303
Appreciate you
giving me the chance
to show you I can help here.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.338
You can thank Cortez.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.407
Commissioner,
you want to help?

25:41.473 --> 25:42.742
Could come with some
real danger, though.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.877
He went after a kid
last time and me today.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.015
When I got taken hostage
in this armory,

25:49.081 --> 25:50.617
your gut instinct
helped save my life.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.785
If your gut's
right about Kim,

25:52.852 --> 25:56.088
and I can help take him down,
then that's what I want to do.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.389
What do you need me to do?

25:59.659 --> 26:01.160
Without entrapping him,

26:01.227 --> 26:03.462
I need you to get Kim to admit
that this development

26:03.529 --> 26:05.031
is just a sham
for washing dirty money.

26:05.097 --> 26:07.734
I'm a police commissioner.
Why do you think
he'd admit that to me?

26:07.800 --> 26:09.135
He might not,

26:09.201 --> 26:11.771
but he trusted you before
when it came to me.

26:11.838 --> 26:13.472
You're gonna be one
of the richest men
in the room.

26:13.539 --> 26:14.674
Kim needs $25 million quick.

26:16.643 --> 26:17.844
Test the microphone.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.078
One-two.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.682
Wow. I can't even
feel it's there.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.516
Don't touch your tie
like that, it's unnatural.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.953
Unnatural is how
covers get blown.

26:27.019 --> 26:30.122
Kim's gonna be more likely
to say something incriminating
if he's comfortable.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.124
Let him come to you.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.694
Commissioner Plank.
Glad you came.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.462
Missed you in Napa
over New Year's.

26:36.528 --> 26:37.830
Jackson Hole for me.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.632
The holidays just seem wrong
without snow.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.134
Yeah.
Excuse me.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.770
Hey.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.204
CORTEZ: Our team will be
nearby, ready to go

26:45.271 --> 26:47.006
if he slips
or if things go sideways.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.407
Sideways?
It can happen.

26:48.474 --> 26:50.576
So my team's gonna be right
outside in the back alley.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.378
CORTEZ: We'll send Chris
undercover for your
protection.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.980
PLANK:
What if he figures out
I'm wearing a wire?

26:54.046 --> 26:55.547
HONDO: He won't. He's gonna
want to believe you.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.684
Just forget you're wearing one
and you won't screw up.

26:57.750 --> 27:00.486
Excuse me.

27:00.552 --> 27:02.021
He's about to start.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.155
See if you can get closer.

27:03.222 --> 27:05.958
KIM: Excuse me, folks.

27:06.025 --> 27:08.360
Thank you for coming
on short notice.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.897
I can assure you
the property development
on Alvarado

27:10.963 --> 27:12.865
is well worth your time.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.867
For those of you
who haven't heard...
Wine, sir?

27:14.934 --> 27:18.237
...my investor in China
ran into liquidity problems
after a government crackdown.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.972
The result is

27:20.039 --> 27:23.275
I have to replace his
$25 million share by tomorrow.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.678
I realize
it sounds aggressive.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.847
I'll let you in on a secret.

27:27.914 --> 27:30.950
This share
is a $40 million value.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.552
I'm in a delicate situation.

27:33.619 --> 27:37.289
I'm offering
a once-in-a-lifetime deal
to my friends.

27:37.356 --> 27:41.193
So please, have a drink,
check the specs.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.895
I'll circle around.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.632
Hey, good to see you.

27:49.301 --> 27:50.770
Michael.

27:50.837 --> 27:53.305
You know
that police officer
we discussed?

27:53.372 --> 27:55.174
Paid me another
uninvited visit today.

27:55.241 --> 27:58.044
He really does have quite
the wrong impression of me.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.311
I'm friendly
with his commander.

27:59.378 --> 28:00.747
I'll get her to make sure
he leaves you alone.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.381
Focuses on his real job.

28:02.448 --> 28:03.549
KIM: Thank you.

28:03.615 --> 28:04.784
PLANK: I got to be honest.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.653
Buying a stake in Alvarado,
I'm intrigued.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.021
KIM: You should be intrigued.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.389
It's an awful lot
on short notice,

28:10.456 --> 28:13.793
but who wouldn't want
to turn 25 into 40?

28:13.860 --> 28:16.495
Just one thing
I'm not sure about.

28:16.562 --> 28:19.231
I'd have no problem
letting you invest
anonymously, Michael.

28:19.298 --> 28:20.466
PLANK: No,
that's not a problem.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.134
Are we gonna get
this guy or what?

28:22.201 --> 28:24.070
He seems to think
he has Michael on the hook.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.504
If better terms are
what you want...

28:25.571 --> 28:26.973
The terms are fine.

28:28.674 --> 28:30.242
It's your Chinese investor.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.044
Something doesn't quite add up
with that story.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.381
I don't mind taking risks,

28:36.482 --> 28:38.650
but I just need to know
the real deal.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.152
You tell me that,
I can get you the money.

28:46.192 --> 28:47.860
Maybe we wouldn't be
good partners in this.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.163
I really should
make the rounds.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.698
Excuse me, Commissioner.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.067
BURROWS: He had him.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.803
What happened?
He was too direct.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.337
Or he blew it on purpose.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.373
Got a civilian
doing a cop's job,
that's what happened.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.809
We didn't have a choice.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.276
We should get you out of here.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.711
I got to talk to him again.
HONDO: No, Michael.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.980
It's time to go.
Door's right behind you,
Michael.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.348
Just give me one more shot.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.283
HQ wants you out,
Commissioner.

29:11.350 --> 29:12.919
You duck out first.
I'll be right behind you.

29:18.524 --> 29:19.992
Excuse me, everyone.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.393
If I can have your attention?

29:22.228 --> 29:23.429
HONDO:
What is he doing?

29:23.495 --> 29:24.864
Love to offer a toast.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.834
Jae,

29:27.900 --> 29:30.436
you're one of the last
true titans
of L.A. real estate.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.972
You've made millions
in this town.

29:33.039 --> 29:35.574
Some would say
you've given even more back.

29:35.641 --> 29:36.909
They'd be wrong.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.180
You know Alvarado
won't turn a profit.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.481
It can't.

29:42.548 --> 29:44.116
It's worth less than half
of its assessment.

29:44.183 --> 29:47.586
You said this property
fell into your lap last month,

29:47.653 --> 29:49.288
but you failed to mention
who you bought it from.

29:50.389 --> 29:51.423
Yourself.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.192
Really?

29:53.259 --> 29:54.426
You're a con man.

30:00.299 --> 30:02.568
I don't know if you've had
too much to drink...

30:03.936 --> 30:05.872
My track record
speaks for itself.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.874
It's your word
against mine.

30:07.940 --> 30:12.011
Whoever invests with you
is throwing away their money.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.891
Nice pivot, Commissioner.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.192
Thanks.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.559
I knew I blew the sting,

30:27.626 --> 30:28.928
so I figured
the least I could do
was stop Kim

30:28.995 --> 30:30.496
from raising the money
to pay that loan back.

30:30.562 --> 30:33.265
After Kim stopped talking,
I thought it was over.
Yeah, me, too.

30:33.332 --> 30:36.768
I just couldn't let Kim
sweet-talk someone else
into handing him a check.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.505
So, figured I'd poison the
well for everyone there,

30:39.571 --> 30:41.407
cut off any financial
escape route.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.509
Can't bust him,
at least keep him desperate.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.078
Target's on your
back now, too.
Same as Hondo.

30:46.145 --> 30:48.915
Counting on the pros
to prove he's a criminal
before it comes to that.

30:48.981 --> 30:51.617
Well, Kim's gonna fight
to the end. Burrows.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.219
The Profetas
that let our getaway driver

30:53.285 --> 30:56.088
bleed all over their mattress,
where are they now?

30:56.155 --> 30:57.589
So, why'd you bring me
back here?

30:57.656 --> 30:59.758
I told you I had no idea
they shot a cop.

30:59.825 --> 31:01.961
Before you started
lifting stereos...

31:02.028 --> 31:04.596
...Profetas were
the main distributors
for a fentanyl operation.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.966
Only business went south
a few months ago. Am I right?

31:07.799 --> 31:08.901
Supply dried up, man.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.937
Jae Kim's supply.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.672
Right.

31:13.739 --> 31:16.775
I got a funny little feeling
the spigot's
about to open up again,

31:16.842 --> 31:19.678
so I need you to tell me
when and where.

31:19.745 --> 31:21.981
I do that, and I walk
out of here a free man?

31:22.048 --> 31:23.182
Free as a bird.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.956
Might have to make
a few phone calls.

31:30.022 --> 31:32.624
Well, let's get you
a phone, then.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.393
There's a shipping yard
right next to the port.

31:34.460 --> 31:35.661
Something's going down
right now.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.996
Big dealer named Grasso.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.630
Armin Grasso.
Little Armenia.

31:38.697 --> 31:40.232
CORTEZ: That's the one.
I guess he's been trying

31:40.299 --> 31:41.767
to tap into the fentanyl
market for a while.

31:41.833 --> 31:42.969
Just got his chance tonight.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.503
Kim's making his move.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.238
He's unloading
his entire supply
he's been sitting on

31:46.305 --> 31:47.506
the past few months
for fast cash.

31:47.573 --> 31:48.607
That's got to be huge.

31:48.674 --> 31:49.875
Like, $25 million worth
of fentanyl?

31:49.942 --> 31:51.710
Probably more.
And there's no way

31:51.777 --> 31:54.180
Kim won't be there personally
to oversee this exchange.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.381
Let's move.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.316
DEACON: Hey,

31:57.383 --> 31:58.617
you can't come with us.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.486
Like hell I can't.
Hicks has you grounded.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.054
I'll beg for
forgiveness later.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.324
The goal is to bust Kim,
not bust Kim and get you
suspended. Or worse.

32:05.391 --> 32:07.159
I'm gonna be there
when we take Kim down.

32:07.226 --> 32:08.360
He went after my friend.

32:09.828 --> 32:12.531
He went after our
friend, too. You.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.133
Look, we got
this covered.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.501
Let's not risk
prosecution.

32:15.567 --> 32:16.802
Come on, Hondo.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.304
We got him.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.871
We're gonna take Kim down.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.274
All the way.
You'd do the same thing
for any one of us.

32:24.143 --> 32:25.911
Go. Go.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.118
* *

32:40.059 --> 32:41.393
Hear that?

32:48.434 --> 32:49.901
Anything from
the two vehicles?

32:49.968 --> 32:51.837
Not a peep.
What about Kim?
He show his face?

32:51.903 --> 32:53.272
Not yet.
DEACON: He's slippery.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.374
If he doesn't show up to this,
we got nothing on him.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.543
Keep looking. Three guys
in the truck on the right,

32:57.609 --> 32:59.745
two in the car on the left.
We got 'em both covered.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.413
Tan, how we doing
on that line to HQ?

33:01.480 --> 33:02.581
Should be up in a minute.

33:05.551 --> 33:06.552
We got movement.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.298
CHRIS:
Anyone see Jae Kim?

33:19.365 --> 33:20.466
LUCA: Nope.

33:30.776 --> 33:31.977
Got him.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.483
* *

33:46.125 --> 33:47.693
Go ahead. Open it up.

33:56.502 --> 33:57.769
CORTEZ: Remember,
we don't have anything

33:57.836 --> 33:59.705
on Kim until he makes a deal.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.273
HONDO: The second
he gives a nod, we pounce.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.874
This place might explode,
so be ready.

34:02.941 --> 34:04.576
We're all over it, boss.
HONDO: I know you are.

34:04.643 --> 34:05.644
Okay, here we go.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.582
What is this?
They're calling it off?
Luca, you hear anything?

34:10.649 --> 34:12.551
LUCA: No,
whispers are too low,
and they didn't

34:12.618 --> 34:14.220
teach Armenian
at my high school.

34:16.355 --> 34:17.823
These guys are either
about to make a deal,

34:17.889 --> 34:19.158
or this place
is about to go off.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.805
That's $25 million
at least. Here we go.

34:33.872 --> 34:35.341
We can't move in
unless there's a confirmation.

34:35.407 --> 34:36.442
A handshake will do.

34:36.508 --> 34:38.577
So, do we have a deal?

34:41.880 --> 34:43.215
Yeah, we got a deal.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.118
HONDO: Go! Now!
Move in! Move in!

34:46.185 --> 34:48.120
We got him! Go!

34:48.187 --> 34:49.488
DEACON: L.A.P.D.!

34:49.555 --> 34:51.457
Freeze!
STREET: L.A.P.D.!

34:51.523 --> 34:53.159
TAN: Hands up!
MAN: Get to the car!

34:53.225 --> 34:54.493
OFFICER 1: Police!
OFFICER 2: Get on him!

34:54.560 --> 34:55.761
L.A.P.D.!

34:55.827 --> 34:57.296
LUCA: Drop your weapons now!

34:59.631 --> 35:00.832
DEACON: I got Kim!

35:02.268 --> 35:04.035
Out of the car! Now!

35:39.905 --> 35:41.207
I got him, Hondo.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.508
I got him.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.345
Bring his ass in.

35:55.654 --> 35:58.224
(INDISTINCT
RADIO TRANSMISSION)

36:10.536 --> 36:12.438
Hey. What's up, Tanner?

36:14.540 --> 36:15.907
Wait, what's going on?

36:21.079 --> 36:23.815
633, Jackson Street.
Yeah, I know it.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.486
All right, man.
I'll be right there.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.792
* *

36:43.669 --> 36:45.471
Feels nice, doesn't it?

36:45.537 --> 36:46.972
Better than nice.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.243
Don't send his kind
away too often.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.144
When we do, they don't
usually stay there.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.580
I have a feeling
this one will stick.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.956
Hey, man.
Neighbor saw a trespasser.

37:05.023 --> 37:07.426
When I got here,
I saw a figure
climbing out the window.

37:07.493 --> 37:08.660
Found her hiding
in the bushes.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.529
Thanks for calling
me first, man.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.598
We're really supposed
to take anyone we find
around here into the station.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.766
You know this area.
No one's up to any good.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.101
It's not gonna happen again.

37:16.167 --> 37:17.803
We're really not supposed
to cut corners anymore.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.371
Don't let me get burned
for this, man.
You won't.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.640
You won't. I promise.
All right.

37:21.707 --> 37:22.841
Thanks.

37:57.075 --> 37:58.344
Why'd you come
back here, Mom?

38:00.379 --> 38:02.213
I had to get something.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.919
I've seen this before.

38:07.986 --> 38:11.390
Only thing I ever got
from my mother,
except the temper.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.193
When things got bad
with your dad and me,

38:15.260 --> 38:18.229
I just... I thought
it would be smart to
have an exit strategy.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.332
So I hid it under
the floorboards. And...

38:20.399 --> 38:23.201
Just... I couldn't
get back here until today,
so...

38:24.770 --> 38:27.406
I... I'm gonna pawn it,
so that, you know,

38:27.473 --> 38:31.109
you don't have
to cover all my expenses
until I get a job.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.717
A lot of memories in there.

38:38.784 --> 38:41.019
You want to go inside?
No.

38:45.090 --> 38:48.026
I never, ever meant
for you to have to
grow up so fast, Jimmy.

38:48.093 --> 38:50.261
I didn't. I mean,

38:50.328 --> 38:52.898
your father was
no good, but...

38:52.964 --> 38:54.966
Neither was I, sometimes.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.736
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39:02.307 --> 39:04.810
It's okay.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.111
Things are better now.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.580
Hmm?

39:13.952 --> 39:15.554
I answered
every question right,

39:15.621 --> 39:17.623
but they didn't want me
for that job.

39:22.293 --> 39:24.129
I don't know how
I'm gonna make it out here.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.316
Hey, champ.

39:47.018 --> 39:48.386
How you doing?
You good?
Yeah.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.256
Hey, listen.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.124
I want to tell
you something,

39:53.191 --> 39:54.926
and you got to promise
you'll always remember.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.094
Promise.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.395
Okay.

39:57.463 --> 39:58.864
There's a word
that you're gonna hear

39:58.930 --> 40:00.799
that gets thrown around
a lot in life.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.233
"Hero."

40:02.300 --> 40:04.570
Now, it's been watered
down over the years.

40:04.636 --> 40:07.873
It's something we say when
somebody gives a good speech

40:07.939 --> 40:10.408
or when somebody gets shot
in the butt.

40:10.476 --> 40:11.677
But, listen,

40:11.743 --> 40:14.245
when a person sticks
with something for months

40:14.312 --> 40:17.015
and doesn't care if they
never get any credit for it

40:17.082 --> 40:19.217
or isn't afraid
to take the heat

40:19.284 --> 40:21.186
even though it's
not their fault,

40:21.252 --> 40:22.888
that's a real hero.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.993
And that's exactly
what your mom is.

40:28.059 --> 40:29.995
You understand?
Yeah.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.063
Good. Go let her know.

40:37.769 --> 40:38.837
Ride's waiting out front.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.305
The hotel's
all set up.

40:40.371 --> 40:42.808
Double beds, continental
breakfast, the works.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.543
We'll have two officers
posted at your door

40:44.610 --> 40:45.677
until things settle down.

40:45.744 --> 40:46.978
You don't have to do this.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.379
I didn't. Hondo did.

40:58.990 --> 41:01.026
Hey.
Hey.

41:01.092 --> 41:03.328
You good?
Yeah.

41:03.394 --> 41:05.864
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just, uh...

41:05.931 --> 41:08.099
I'm relieved.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.337
You guys did great out there.

41:16.407 --> 41:19.210
Hey, uh...

41:19.277 --> 41:20.979
Can I ask you a favor?

41:27.653 --> 41:28.920
Surprised
you didn't ask Deac.

41:30.589 --> 41:31.723
Oh, he didn't
go for it, did he?

41:32.924 --> 41:36.361
Said not to take three rights
to make a left.

41:36.427 --> 41:37.729
Whatever that means.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.400
So can you sign it?

41:42.467 --> 41:44.202
Are you sure this is
what's best for you?

41:44.269 --> 41:46.504
I'm sure it's
what's best for her.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.582
Thanks.

42:00.686 --> 42:02.253
There they are.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.255
Real quick,
everyone. Um...

42:04.322 --> 42:05.957
I want to say
something.

42:07.492 --> 42:08.794
There's been times in my life

42:08.860 --> 42:11.863
when I didn't feel like
people really had my back.

42:11.930 --> 42:14.199
But what each one of you did
for me out there tonight...

42:16.868 --> 42:19.971
Look, I... I really
don't know what to say
except I'll never forget it.

42:23.174 --> 42:24.542
Thank you.
