Yes, you are!

00:12.366 --> 00:14.584
Well, I wish
I'd never married you!

00:14.669 --> 00:16.085
It was a mistake I did.

is one half
of a bumper-car token.

01:29.577 --> 01:30.827
Where's the other half?

01:30.912 --> 01:32.079
With a girl.

01:32.130 --> 01:33.697
Brooke?
Nope.

01:33.765 --> 01:36.266
When I was around your age,
I went to a county fair,

01:36.334 --> 01:39.786
and I met a girl, and we went
on a bunch of rides together.

01:39.854 --> 01:41.755
Oh, cool.
Which rides?

01:41.806 --> 01:43.890
Doesn't matter.
Old county-fair rides.

01:43.958 --> 01:45.509
Totally irrelevant
to the story.

01:46.894 --> 01:49.980
Okay. One of them
was the Octopus.

01:50.064 --> 01:51.148
I love the Octopus.

01:52.633 --> 01:56.019
Anyway, the point is, it was
the first crush I ever had.

01:56.104 --> 01:59.773
And not a "Chester likes Brooke"
kind of crush -- a real crush.

01:59.824 --> 02:01.608
You ever have
that feeling?

02:01.676 --> 02:04.194
I think Madison's
pretty cool.

02:04.278 --> 02:06.246
Mm-hmm.
Right.

02:06.313 --> 02:08.615
Well, I thought this girl
was pretty cool, too.

02:08.666 --> 02:12.335
And at the end of the night,
we only had one token left.

02:12.420 --> 02:14.755
So we decided
to break it in half.

02:14.822 --> 02:17.507
So, what happened
to the girl?

02:17.592 --> 02:19.543
I don't know.

02:19.627 --> 02:21.528
I don't even remember
her name.

02:21.596 --> 02:23.797
It wasn't really
about the girl.

02:23.848 --> 02:27.784
It was about the idea
of someone out there...for me.

02:27.852 --> 02:31.188
So I kept this half
bumper-car token ever since

02:31.272 --> 02:33.974
as a reminder
that somewhere out there,

02:34.025 --> 02:36.927
if I'm lucky,
is my other half.

02:41.566 --> 02:43.900
Think you can stop me,
punk?

02:43.985 --> 02:45.902
No.
Why am I a punk?

02:45.987 --> 02:47.904
'Cause you're standing
between me and the basket.

02:47.989 --> 02:49.322
Oh, sorry.
Do you want me to move?

02:49.373 --> 02:50.207
No.
You're fine right there.

02:52.359 --> 02:53.827
Ooh. Nice.

02:53.878 --> 02:57.197
So, have you written
your best-man speech yet?

02:57.248 --> 02:58.548
I'm supposed to write a speech?
Yeah.

02:58.633 --> 03:00.417
At the reception, the best man
and the maid of honor,

03:00.501 --> 03:01.751
they always give speeches.

03:01.836 --> 03:03.036
About what?

03:03.087 --> 03:04.588
You just talk about
what Julian means to you

03:04.672 --> 03:06.423
and why he and Brooke
are right for each other.

03:06.507 --> 03:08.091
You know, your mom
probably didn't tell you this

03:08.176 --> 03:10.227
because she wants her speech
to be better than yours.

03:10.311 --> 03:11.895
Of course she did.

03:11.979 --> 03:14.547
Ah, there he is.
We were just talking about you.

03:14.599 --> 03:15.715
You nervous
for the big day?

03:15.766 --> 03:16.933
Why would I be nervous?

Listen up.

07:12.650 --> 07:14.067
It all starts here.

07:14.118 --> 07:15.952
As ushers
at today's wedding,

07:16.037 --> 07:17.787
we've been given
a huge responsibility.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.689
And I'm not gonna lie.
It might be dangerous.

07:19.757 --> 07:21.207
But that's why
we were chosen.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.859

Julian has no guy friends.

Dude, come on.

We're just supposed to seat
the guests

07:30.334 --> 07:32.001
when they show up
and then go get drunk.

07:32.086 --> 07:33.803
There will be no drinking
during today's security detail.

07:33.888 --> 07:36.539
Skills, we're ushers,
not security.

07:36.607 --> 07:38.641

Come on in.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.423
So, I'm --
I'm gonna go find out

08:10.491 --> 08:12.292
what that heavenly mattress
is made of.

08:12.343 --> 08:14.994
What can I do for you?

08:15.045 --> 08:17.330
It's your wedding day.

08:17.381 --> 08:19.432
Mom, that doesn't mean
that you can just show up --

08:19.500 --> 08:22.469
so I thought I'd just stop by
and give you this.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.006
Go ahead.

08:27.057 --> 08:28.525
It's definitely old --

08:28.609 --> 08:30.944
not that I expect or even
allow you to wear it tonight.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.980
But I know
it meant a lot to you.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.120
I can't believe
you kept this.

08:40.187 --> 08:43.072

you found it.

08:43.157 --> 08:45.074
So do I.

08:45.159 --> 08:47.293
You brought it to me
and you said,

08:47.361 --> 08:49.695
"someday, mom,
I'm gonna wear one of these."

08:51.749 --> 08:54.100
And do you remember
what you said to me?

08:54.168 --> 08:56.136
You said,
"don't ever get married, Brooke.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.822
It'll ruin your life."

09:00.424 --> 09:01.891
Yeah.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.843
Well...

09:03.894 --> 09:05.545
I guess it's a good thing,
then,

09:05.596 --> 09:07.931

09:33.974 --> 09:36.409
Well, Chase said they're going
as friends, but who knows?

09:36.477 --> 09:38.928
Either way, it just creates
a really awkward situation.

09:38.996 --> 09:41.914

myself with them.

09:41.966 --> 09:44.334

about Chase and Mia.

22:06.382 --> 22:08.316

22:11.287 --> 22:12.220
Julian.

22:12.287 --> 22:14.005
Thank you.

22:15.474 --> 22:19.344
Brooke, before I met you,

22:19.428 --> 22:23.064
I thought my world had
everything I needed to be happy.

22:23.131 --> 22:25.850
I had nothing else
to compare it to.

22:25.935 --> 22:29.988
Then you walked into my life,
and everything changed.

22:30.072 --> 22:33.908
I realized how empty
my world was without you in it.

22:33.976 --> 22:38.580
And my old life was no longer
capable of making me happy,

22:38.647 --> 22:40.448
not without you.

22:40.499 --> 22:44.836
I love everything about you,
Brooke.

22:44.920 --> 22:48.873
I love the way you challenge me
like no one ever has.

22:48.958 --> 22:51.826
I love the way you look at me
like no one ever has.

22:51.894 --> 22:57.164
And I love the way you love me
like no one ever has.

22:57.216 --> 23:01.519
I can't imagine spending my life
without you.

23:01.587 --> 23:05.773
And if you say yes to me
in a few minutes,

23:05.841 --> 23:07.191
I won't have to.

23:07.276 --> 23:09.777

23:09.845 --> 23:11.813

23:13.699 --> 23:15.266
Brooke.

23:15.334 --> 23:19.053
Julian...

23:19.121 --> 23:22.857
Before I met you, my world
revolved around one thing.

23:22.908 --> 23:24.025
Me.

23:25.227 --> 23:27.578
And I liked it that way,
on my own.

23:27.663 --> 23:30.882
But then I met you,
and you saw through the facade.

23:30.966 --> 23:32.300
You saw me.

23:32.367 --> 23:36.170
You've taught me to trust,
how to let someone in,

23:36.221 --> 23:39.807
and what it truly means
to fall in love.

23:39.875 --> 23:43.678
I can't possibly describe
how much I love you,

23:43.729 --> 23:46.247
so I'll tell you
<i>why</i> I love you.

23:46.315 --> 23:50.852
You see the world in a way
that no one else does,

23:50.903 --> 23:54.155
and you appreciate
everything...

23:54.222 --> 23:55.690

23:55.741 --> 23:58.726

that easy for you.

30:24.412 --> 30:26.113
It's not so bad.

30:26.197 --> 30:29.399
I may want to rip his head off
every time he opens his mouth.

30:29.451 --> 30:32.369
But the truth is,

30:32.454 --> 30:35.906
when I look at him,
I am reminded that he is the guy

30:35.957 --> 30:39.293
who gave me the single greatest
gift in my life.

30:39.377 --> 30:41.912
My Aston Martin.

30:43.048 --> 30:44.348
And you.

30:48.637 --> 30:54.358
♪ When I say this love
will never fade away ♪

30:54.425 --> 30:56.727
♪ oh, because ♪

30:56.778 --> 31:00.481
♪ you are the best thing ♪

31:00.565 --> 31:03.701
So, is that it?

31:03.768 --> 31:05.903
Yep.

31:05.954 --> 31:07.604
Almost that time.

31:07.656 --> 31:08.872
I'm ready.

31:08.940 --> 31:12.493
I guess the question is...
Are you ready?

31:12.577 --> 31:14.778
What if no one likes
my speech?

31:17.215 --> 31:20.217
Sweetie, everybody's
gonna love your speech.

31:20.284 --> 31:23.721
Well, I keep reading it.
It's not very good.

31:23.788 --> 31:25.089
I don't want Julian

31:25.140 --> 31:27.391
to wish he had picked
someone else to be his best man.

31:27.458 --> 31:29.593
Julian chose you
because he loves you

31:29.661 --> 31:31.795
and because
of what you mean to him,

31:31.846 --> 31:34.631
not because of some speech
that you have to give.

31:34.683 --> 31:38.102
Hey,
I'm sure it's great,

31:38.153 --> 31:39.653
but if you don't like
what you wrote,

31:39.738 --> 31:41.638
you can always just tell us
a story about Julian,

31:41.690 --> 31:43.107
something that reminds you
of him.

31:43.158 --> 31:44.808
All right, everyone,
it's time for the best man

31:44.859 --> 31:46.660
to come on up here
and say a few words.

31:49.164 --> 31:51.314
Okay.
Take a deep breath.

31:53.668 --> 31:55.169
Tell us a story.

32:08.700 --> 32:10.467
J.K. Rowling once wrote,

32:10.535 --> 32:15.272
"the consequences of our actions
are so complicated, so diverse

32:15.339 --> 32:18.175
that predicting the future is a
very difficult business indeed."

32:26.951 --> 32:28.902
J.K. Rowling was right.

32:28.987 --> 32:33.407
But what most of you don't know
is Julian was able to do it.

32:33.475 --> 32:36.744
He knew a long time ago
that he would find Brooke.

32:36.828 --> 32:38.912
When Julian was my age,

32:38.997 --> 32:42.666
which was a very, very, very,
<i>very</i> long time ago,

32:42.717 --> 32:45.552
he went to a county fair,
and he met a girl --

32:45.637 --> 32:47.370
not Brooke.

32:47.422 --> 32:50.424
But they went on a bunch
of rides together,

32:50.508 --> 32:52.042
including the Octopus.

32:52.093 --> 32:54.511
Irrelevant to the story.

32:54.562 --> 32:58.982
But that night, Julian felt
a crush for the first time,

32:59.050 --> 33:00.383
a real crush.

33:00.435 --> 33:03.720
Relax, Aunt Brooke.
He was my age.

33:04.856 --> 33:06.490
So at the end of the night,

33:06.557 --> 33:08.926
they decided to break
this bumper-car token in half.

33:08.993 --> 33:11.945
Julian has kept his half
all these years,

33:12.030 --> 33:14.231
not because he missed the girl,

33:14.282 --> 33:18.285
but because he knew somewhere
out there was the other half,

33:18.369 --> 33:20.037
his perfect match.

33:21.589 --> 33:23.240
And he was right.

33:23.291 --> 33:26.510
Today Julian married
my Aunt Brooke.

33:26.577 --> 33:29.263
She's probably
the coolest girl I know

33:29.347 --> 33:31.682
and the girl Julian's
been waiting for

33:31.749 --> 33:34.802
since he broke
this bumper-car token in half

33:34.886 --> 33:38.472
a <i>long</i> time ago
at a county fair.

33:38.540 --> 33:42.392
And today
Julian gave me this token.

33:42.443 --> 33:45.062
He said he didn't need it
anymore

33:45.113 --> 33:46.947
because he found his other half.

33:47.031 --> 33:49.817
Congratulations, Julian.
I think it was worth the wait.

33:49.901 --> 33:51.151
Thanks, buddy.

34:08.514 --> 34:11.033
Well, when  I first met Brooke Davis

34:11.266 --> 34:13.049
she had no idea who I was.

34:13.906 --> 34:15.322
Of course,
everyone knew who she was.

34:15.373 --> 34:17.358
She was the most popular girl
in school.

34:17.409 --> 34:19.159
She was head cheerleader,
annoyingly pretty.

34:19.210 --> 34:20.962
Still is.

34:21.030 --> 34:23.297
And I used to wonder back then,

34:23.364 --> 34:25.967
"what it would be like
to be friends with Brooke?

34:26.034 --> 34:27.719
"Would she make me popular?

34:27.803 --> 34:30.138
Would all the boys
start asking me out?"

34:30.205 --> 34:33.174
And then one night, I got to
hang out with Brooke all night.

34:33.225 --> 34:34.958
And, oh, she didn't like
my name, though,

34:35.027 --> 34:37.512
so she decided she was
gonna give me a name

34:37.563 --> 34:40.214
that she did like,
which ended up being Brooke.

34:41.266 --> 34:43.266
And from that moment,

34:43.351 --> 34:45.820
I knew that I wanted Brooke
to be my friend,

34:45.887 --> 34:48.188
not because she was gonna
make me popular

34:48.257 --> 34:50.541
and not because boys
would start asking me out,

34:50.609 --> 34:54.895
but because I got a glimpse
of the real Brooke,

34:54.947 --> 34:59.534
a girl with the biggest heart
that I have ever known.

34:59.601 --> 35:01.119
And, you know,
when you're in High School,

35:01.203 --> 35:04.238
it's not very easy to let people
see who you really are.

35:04.289 --> 35:06.174
I could see it, though.

35:06.241 --> 35:08.009
It was in the eyes.

35:08.076 --> 35:12.046
So we became friends,
and now she's my best friend.

35:12.097 --> 35:14.716
We've been through so much
together over the years.

35:14.767 --> 35:16.584
And our friendship
is still growing.

35:16.635 --> 35:20.254
So I know that your friendship
and love for Julian

35:20.322 --> 35:23.608
will continue to grow every year
for the rest of your lives.

35:23.692 --> 35:26.778
And I feel so lucky
to be a part of that.

35:26.862 --> 35:29.764
I love you, Brooke Davis.

35:38.991 --> 35:40.625
And now at this time,

35:40.709 --> 35:42.860
I need all the single ladies
to come on up to the front.

35:42.928 --> 35:45.663
Brooke has something
she wants to toss your way.

35:47.332 --> 35:48.966
All right. Get in there.
Make me proud.

35:49.051 --> 35:50.718
Oh, no, it's my responsibility,
you know,

35:50.786 --> 35:52.387
to capture the big moments
at the wedding,

35:52.454 --> 35:53.454
like the bouquet toss.

35:53.505 --> 35:54.922
So I can't really
participate.

35:54.973 --> 35:56.891
Right. Give me the camera.
Just point and click, right?

35:56.958 --> 35:58.393
No. It's more complicated
than that.

35:58.460 --> 35:59.627
I mean,
you have to, like --

35:59.678 --> 36:01.796
go.
I've used a camera before.

36:01.847 --> 36:03.297
Just point and click.
Thanks.

36:03.348 --> 36:05.633
Okay, Brooke.
When you're ready.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.782
You're having fun.

36:20.833 --> 36:22.483
It's nice
to see you like this.

36:22.534 --> 36:25.169
I feel like
we got our lives back.

36:25.254 --> 36:28.256
Yeah.

36:28.323 --> 36:29.990
Clay, I need to
tell you something.

36:30.042 --> 36:32.126
Okay.

36:32.177 --> 36:34.095
It was my fault
that Katie came back.

36:35.764 --> 36:38.132
Don't say that.

36:38.183 --> 36:39.383
It's my fault.

36:39.468 --> 36:40.852
No, it's not, okay?

36:40.936 --> 36:44.722
After I left South Africa,
I didn't come home right away...

36:44.807 --> 36:46.808
Because I found Katie.

36:46.859 --> 36:50.728
And she knew that I found her,
so she came back for me.

36:50.813 --> 36:52.613
It was my fault, Clay.

36:52.681 --> 36:54.198
Why didn't you tell me?

36:54.283 --> 36:55.533
I don't know.

36:55.617 --> 36:58.536
Maybe I was afraid
of what you'd say.

36:58.620 --> 36:59.871
But...

36:59.955 --> 37:02.189
But I wanted you to know.

37:02.241 --> 37:04.492

But I could have lost you
forever, Quinn.

38:21.370 --> 38:23.771

39:09.451 --> 39:10.751
No.
You were right.

39:10.819 --> 39:14.088
This night wasn't about them.
It wasn't about me.

39:14.155 --> 39:15.339
It was about Brooke
and Julian.

39:15.424 --> 39:18.209
And I'm really happy
I was here for them.

39:20.012 --> 39:22.263
You know,
you don't have to try so hard --

39:22.330 --> 39:24.448
with Chase
or with any guy.

39:24.516 --> 39:26.333
Look at you.

39:26.385 --> 39:28.436
You're beautiful
and you're fun,

39:28.503 --> 39:31.188
and any guy would be so lucky
to be with you.

39:31.273 --> 39:32.807
Thanks, Quinn.

39:32.858 --> 39:36.143
You know, I think
I just realized something.

39:36.194 --> 39:39.947
Chase was into Mia,
and then he was into me.

39:40.015 --> 39:42.182
And then he wasn't sure.

39:42.234 --> 39:45.620
And I think I just --
I wanted to win.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.905
So maybe
it wasn't about Chase.

39:47.990 --> 39:49.957
Maybe it was more about
<i>the</i> chase.

39:51.293 --> 39:52.693
Yeah.

39:54.046 --> 39:55.630
Come here.
No more crying.

39:55.697 --> 39:57.665
Thanks, Quinn.

40:01.670 --> 40:04.755
Psst.
Hey, sleepy.

40:08.260 --> 40:10.728

You think it was okay?

40:12.230 --> 40:14.098

40:14.182 --> 40:18.653
Man, I have heard a lot
of best-man speeches in my life,

40:18.720 --> 40:22.189
and yours was by far
the sweetest, the most honest,

40:22.240 --> 40:23.991
and the most memorable.

40:24.059 --> 40:27.979

so proud of you.

40:28.046 --> 40:29.447

40:29.531 --> 40:32.166
Your little sister
would be proud, too.

40:32.233 --> 40:33.918
I'm gonna have
a little sister?

40:34.002 --> 40:35.036
Is that okay?

40:35.087 --> 40:36.420
