- Do what we say, Priscilla will be back.

00:07.480 --> 00:10.598
In the meantime, you will be our
guide, and you won't tell anyone.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.956
- How did you find me?
- You remember Priscilla?

00:13.120 --> 00:14.269
She tracked you.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.273
You're not Monroe!
You said that you weren't Monroe.

00:17.440 --> 00:20.398
Don't be him. Don't we have
enough blood on our hands?

00:20.560 --> 00:21.994
You want to win this thing or not?

00:22.160 --> 00:23.673
You don't care about saving the town.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.036
At least I know
what I'm fighting for.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.952
I'm asking for your help.

-Intel from Truman's office.
- Why are you telling us this?

00:37.840 --> 00:38.989
I want to help you stop him.

Bad things happen, that's life.

02:31.680 --> 02:34.877
You got to do whatever
it takes to win, right?

02:35.040 --> 02:37.350
Austin was a win.

02:37.520 --> 02:40.034
Quit wringing your hands about it.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.870
Finally. Now your head's in the game.

02:45.040 --> 02:49.034
Now all we got to do is
figure out our next move.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.077
We got to shoot Tom Neville.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.429

outside Austin.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.033
We shoot them all down.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.795
Last I checked,
we still wanted Texas on our side.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.156
So if we could stop killing them,
that'd be great.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.352
Pull the wagon over.

03:25.440 --> 03:27.875
- Miles: Everybody off.
- What? Why?

03:28.040 --> 03:29.678
I'm going to lead them
on a goose chase.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.114
Get them so turned around
they can't find us.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.796

But I don't want to kill you.
We're on the same side.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.792
I don't know.
President's kind of irritated with you

trying to shoot him and all.

You're no Mother Teresa.

23:20.360 --> 23:23.352
You're a screwdriver-wielding
psychopath.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.073
Oh...

23:26.360 --> 23:29.000
You know me, and...

23:29.160 --> 23:31.674
you know Miles, you know everybody?

23:31.840 --> 23:33.114
- Damn right.
- Yeah?

23:33.560 --> 23:38.873
'Cause I know you pretty well too,
Bass, you insecure child.

23:39.880 --> 23:42.838
Miles is good man.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.471
His only problem is you.
You're like... poison.

23:48.200 --> 23:52.637
You're like this devil on his back.
And he knows it.

23:52.920 --> 23:56.515
And he hates you for it.
And why?

23:58.160 --> 24:01.357
Because you can't bear to be alone.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.749
You won't be happy

24:02.960 --> 24:05.520
until you drag him down
into the mud next to you.

24:05.680 --> 24:08.593
You are that pathetic.

24:09.120 --> 24:13.990
If I'm that pathetic, Rachel,
and you are so good...

24:16.480 --> 24:19.552
Explain to me that night
in Philadelphia.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.358
I was your prisoner.

24:24.360 --> 24:26.476
Nobody forced you.

(MOANING)

24:43.440 --> 24:46.114
You stay the hell away from me.

25:16.320 --> 25:19.756
- What the hell is this?
- They're probably on a scout.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.833
Jason's with them, they'll be back.

25:31.440 --> 25:36.514
My patience has reached an end.

25:38.680 --> 25:43.675
You are going to take me to Jason,

25:43.800 --> 25:46.269
or you're going to die.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.318
What was that?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.913
- What?
- On your face.

26:02.440 --> 26:05.671
Where is Jason?

26:07.160 --> 26:09.436
I don't know.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.597
You're lying.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.039
Why?

26:19.680 --> 26:22.991
- Is he hurt?
- No, he's fine.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.353
He is hurt.

26:34.120 --> 26:37.829
Is he dead?

26:43.360 --> 26:44.430
No.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.555
That's... not...

26:48.280 --> 26:49.236
No!

26:51.120 --> 26:54.954
(GUNSHOTS)

27:09.160 --> 27:11.310
Was it Monroe? Was it Miles?

27:12.320 --> 27:14.231
Yeah, had to be Miles.

27:14.440 --> 27:15.999
He always had it out for the boy.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.633
This is what is going to happen.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.039
You're bait.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.959
I am going to use you
to draw in Monroe,

27:25.160 --> 27:28.073
Miles, your mother, everyone.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.754
And I am going to work
my way through them

27:31.000 --> 27:33.071
until I figure this out.

27:40.880 --> 27:42.871
It was me.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.394
Please.

27:49.320 --> 27:53.951
Out of all the people who would want
to do this to him, you wouldn't.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.035
Yeah, I didn't think I could either.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.559
The Patriots must've read
that number.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.999
And they turned him
into something that he wasn't.

28:07.640 --> 28:11.315
He was trying to kill me.
I begged him to stop.

28:11.480 --> 28:13.756
Believe me, it was the last thing
that I wanted to do.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.951
But he wouldn't stop.

28:17.920 --> 28:20.639
I cared about him.

28:24.160 --> 28:27.152
I cared about him
and that's what I did to him.

28:27.960 --> 28:30.031
And I hate myself for it.

28:30.200 --> 28:34.319
So if you're going to kill me,
you should just do it.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.517

Rachel: It's his coat.

29:38.200 --> 29:39.759
Miles!

29:51.400 --> 29:54.677
No, that...
That's someone else's blood.

29:54.840 --> 29:58.037
Nope. It's on the inside.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.519
Bass...

30:03.920 --> 30:05.433
...it's too much blood.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.870
Okay. Rachel, look at me.

30:17.280 --> 30:21.194
You know Miles. I've seen him take
a hell of a lot worse than this.

30:21.360 --> 30:25.877
You kick that guy in the teeth,
he jumps straight back up,

30:26.040 --> 30:28.316
and he kicks back twice as hard.

30:31.160 --> 30:34.994
That son of a bitch is
too stubborn to die.

30:35.720 --> 30:38.234
We're going to find him, okay?

30:43.080 --> 30:44.639
Yeah.

30:47.800 --> 30:48.835
Yeah.

30:50.040 --> 30:52.270
Yeah, you're right.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.910
Connor: It's going to be nightfall
in an hour.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.276
You really going back out?

31:09.520 --> 31:11.193
Yeah, I have to.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.755
Look, I'm sorry
for having to say this...

31:17.000 --> 31:19.469
...but... whatever happened to Miles,

31:19.640 --> 31:22.314
if he could've got out by now,
he would've.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.957
You see this?

31:32.680 --> 31:34.956
It's from Neville
shoving his gun in my face

31:35.160 --> 31:38.357
after I asked him to shoot me.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.755
And just as he was pulling
the trigger...

31:48.040 --> 31:49.951
...no going back...

31:51.120 --> 31:53.953
...every single part of my body
started screaming,

31:54.120 --> 31:56.111
"I don't want to die!"

32:00.040 --> 32:01.872
But it was too late.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.956
He pulled the trigger...

32:09.640 --> 32:11.995
...and his gun was empty.

32:16.120 --> 32:19.078
I don't think I deserve it,

32:19.240 --> 32:23.552
but somehow I'm getting
a second chance.

32:23.720 --> 32:29.079
I get to wake up and see tomorrow
And I guess I want to.

32:31.880 --> 32:35.919
So now I need to figure out
what kind of tomorrow I want to see.

32:37.440 --> 32:39.238
And I'll tell you one thing.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.869
Whatever it looks like,

32:42.040 --> 32:45.112
I want Miles to be there.

33:11.280 --> 33:14.238
Aaron: If you want to try pizza,
I will make you a pizza.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.950
I can go out and find some tomatoes.
And I can mill some flour.

33:18.120 --> 33:21.556
And I will milk a damn cow
to make cheese... whatever.

33:22.720 --> 33:23.915
Just find Miles.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.993
How many times
have we been over this? No.

33:28.760 --> 33:32.879
Listen, I got news for you.
Being human isn't this.

33:34.120 --> 33:37.954
It isn't food or music or even sex.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.193
It's about loyalty.

33:42.040 --> 33:43.678
It's about being there for a friend

33:43.840 --> 33:47.993
who has been there for you,
and that's what it means.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.470
I'm still the one who made you,
and if that means anything to you,

33:54.640 --> 33:58.190
I am begging you,
please help us find him.

34:01.040 --> 34:05.477
Yes, you made me,
and I suppose I'll always love you.

34:05.640 --> 34:06.960
But you don't get to make demands.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.554
You don't control me.
It's the other way around.

34:10.760 --> 34:12.751
Now if you bring this up again,

34:12.920 --> 34:15.480
I'll have to kill Priscilla.

34:18.199 --> 34:20.998
Maybe...
the rest of your friends.

34:26.480 --> 34:29.677
I will take that pizza, though.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.998
I'm dreaming.

37:23.840 --> 37:27.435
- Must have passed out.
- What a shocker, you're drunk.

37:29.200 --> 37:33.990
Why don't you just... go home,
screw my wife and sleep it off?

37:37.440 --> 37:39.431
If you'll excuse me,
it's time to wake up.

37:39.600 --> 37:42.956
You must be...
thrilled that I'm finally gone,

37:43.120 --> 37:44.838
out of the way.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.879
You can bang her whenever you want.

37:49.040 --> 37:51.395
How long was it?

37:52.560 --> 37:54.870
You're my brother.

37:55.400 --> 37:59.075
Do you even have the decency
to tell me, to face me?

37:59.800 --> 38:00.710
No.

38:01.760 --> 38:05.879
Of course decency was never
really your strong suit, was it?

38:06.040 --> 38:08.316
- Shut up.
- What are you thinking?

38:08.480 --> 38:10.517
You'll protect Rachel and Charlie?

38:10.920 --> 38:12.911
They count on you.

38:14.160 --> 38:17.676
You're going to fail them...
like you always do,

38:17.840 --> 38:19.638
because we both know
who you really are.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.393
Shut up.

38:22.160 --> 38:26.119
Savage. You're an animal.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.880
And people suffer around you
because of it.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.516
And sooner or later,
they will die.

38:36.240 --> 38:38.754

just leave them.

We both know it.
