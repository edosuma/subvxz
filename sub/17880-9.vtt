WEBVTT

00:05.793 --> 00:08.220
A well-run company is like
an intricate machine.

00:08.345 --> 00:12.625
A lot of moving parts working together
in perfect precision.

00:17.444 --> 00:20.876
You might say Veridian Dynamics
is like a finely tuned watch.

00:20.976 --> 00:24.462
That's Dale. He even has
a big hand and a little hand.

00:24.562 --> 00:27.268
You guys are great.
Ahead of schedule and under budget.

00:27.368 --> 00:28.505
So what is it?

00:28.630 --> 00:31.072
We call it "The voice of God."

00:31.449 --> 00:33.446
No, we don't.
- No, we don't.

00:33.546 --> 00:35.774
Hypersonic sound, or H.S,

00:35.994 --> 00:37.814
projects a narrow beam of sound

00:37.914 --> 00:40.882
which can only be heard
by a specifically targeted person.

00:40.982 --> 00:43.352
Field testing shows
that the subject, or "victim,"

00:43.452 --> 00:46.462
as I like to call people "helped"
by Veridian technology,

00:46.562 --> 00:48.683
can be hundreds of feet away
and will hear the message

00:48.783 --> 00:50.701
as thought it's being whispered
only to them.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.361
It's highly persuasive.

00:52.389 --> 00:54.305
Advertising companies
are very excited

00:54.405 --> 00:56.718
because it will allow them
to burrow even deeper

00:56.818 --> 00:58.318
into the human brain.

00:59.845 --> 01:02.880
Let's zap Rick.
He's always using the copy machine.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.871
We get it.
You need to make a lot of copies.

01:05.971 --> 01:07.951
Just don't set it too high.

01:08.003 --> 01:10.066
At full power,
the sound wave is so intense,

01:10.166 --> 01:11.513
it can cause vomiting.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.164
A machine that causes vomiting.

01:13.264 --> 01:16.101
that could have all kinds
of applications for the military...

01:16.201 --> 01:17.728
And fashion modeling.

01:19.623 --> 01:21.437
It's me... God.

01:23.788 --> 01:26.568
You want me
to stop using the copier?

01:27.485 --> 01:30.385
But why?
I don't make that many copies.

01:32.303 --> 01:34.283
No, I'm not questioning you.

01:35.564 --> 01:39.304
This is what it would be like
if god was insecure.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.097
This place may be
a perfectly tuned machine,

01:45.197 --> 01:46.982
but the thing about
a perfect machine,

01:47.082 --> 01:51.662
it only takes the smallest glitch
to throw the whole thing off.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.966 --> 02:05.536
That's not right.

02:17.102 --> 02:18.466
Really not right.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.556
This is such a circus.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.175
You're a baby, you know that?

02:28.275 --> 02:30.631
A big baby.
- Veronica, it's toxic.

02:30.731 --> 02:32.655
We had to call in
the contamination guys.

02:32.755 --> 02:36.772
Am I allowed to ask what ate my desk?
- All we know is it came from a leak

02:36.872 --> 02:39.193
from Dr. Bhamba's biocomputer
upstairs.

02:39.293 --> 02:42.583
A biocomputer.
It's half machine, half living organism.

02:42.683 --> 02:45.588
If you think that sounds creepy,
you should see it at feeding time.

02:45.688 --> 02:48.768
Speaking of useless,
half-living organisms...

02:49.695 --> 02:52.082
I brought doughnuts...
A festive treat

02:52.182 --> 02:54.408
while we wait out
this little inconvenience.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.086
Don't think you can buy
your way out of this with doughnuts,

02:57.186 --> 02:59.286
Just give me a status report.

02:59.307 --> 03:01.227
Okay, and a buttermilk log.

03:01.635 --> 03:02.832
The biocomputer,

03:02.957 --> 03:05.857
which I have humorously
named "Johnny"...

03:09.162 --> 03:10.970
Has been leaking an acid-like goo,

03:11.070 --> 03:12.593
or "ass-goo," for short.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.937
Anyway, we're stumped.

03:14.037 --> 03:15.993
Johnny has been running nonstop
for three years,

03:16.093 --> 03:18.006
and we've never had a problem
like this before.

03:18.106 --> 03:21.524
Sadly, until we find the reason
for the leak, it will continue.

03:21.624 --> 03:23.955
Is it even safe to work
in the building?

03:24.055 --> 03:25.375
Just get it fixed.

03:25.957 --> 03:28.057
And you need to grow a pair.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.059
<i>Veronica assigned Dr. Bhamba
to room 4-d,</i>

03:32.159 --> 03:35.839
<i>which is known as
"the ridiculously tiny office."</i>

03:39.303 --> 03:41.583
This office is ridiculously tiny.

03:45.059 --> 03:47.773
<i>Other employees were left
to find their own office space.</i>

03:47.873 --> 03:50.075
People, people!
- Please, help us!

03:50.175 --> 03:52.815
I hate seeing you put out like this.

03:53.911 --> 03:57.329
I said, I hate seeing you
put out like this.

04:02.189 --> 04:03.124
Thank you.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.917
Make sure that it...
It's more powdery.

04:07.017 --> 04:09.082
I'm supposed to share
an office with Wallace,

04:09.182 --> 04:11.149
that food-taster guy
in the basement.

04:11.249 --> 04:13.469
Unless anyone else has an idea?

04:14.718 --> 04:17.498
Take the freight elevator?
It's faster.

04:17.793 --> 04:18.632
Thanks.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.880
That's exactly the idea
I was looking for.

04:24.072 --> 04:25.843
I don't know anything about women...

04:25.943 --> 04:29.443
At least, according to my wife...
But I think...

04:29.587 --> 04:33.297
Linda wants to move into your office.
- I know, but it'd be awkward.

04:33.397 --> 04:35.892
Even though she has a boyfriend,
there's always been this...

04:35.992 --> 04:37.492
Attraction between us.

04:37.796 --> 04:39.776
I mean, she is smokin' hot.

04:40.538 --> 04:44.062
Anyway, you're right, but
I just don't think it's a good idea.

04:44.162 --> 04:46.291
So I do know something about women.

04:46.391 --> 04:48.132
I am gonna call my wife

04:48.409 --> 04:50.789
and tell her how hot Linda is.

04:52.096 --> 04:53.143
Oh, wait.

05:00.927 --> 05:03.227
Experimental cracker?
- God. No.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.125
But you keep chewing.

05:11.927 --> 05:12.806
Pretty.

05:17.150 --> 05:21.329
Maybe I wasn't being that clear before.
Can I move in with you?

05:21.429 --> 05:23.857
But what about Wallace
and all his crazy foods?

05:23.957 --> 05:25.397
That's gotta be fun.

05:26.428 --> 05:28.628
He told me he needs
a good woman in his life

05:28.728 --> 05:30.468
cause his mom just died.

05:30.512 --> 05:33.394
Then he coughed up some of
the experimental cracker he's eating

05:33.494 --> 05:34.912
and swal lowed it again.

05:35.012 --> 05:38.080
I mean, sure, every girl dreams
of a romantic moment like that,

05:38.180 --> 05:40.580
but it was all happening so fast.

05:41.288 --> 05:43.560
Well, I'd love to help you, Linda,

05:43.660 --> 05:47.622
but I don't have a big office.
- In here. In here... In here...

05:47.722 --> 05:49.882
And there's that terrible echo.

05:51.583 --> 05:54.425
Of course. I'd be happy
to have you share my office.

05:54.525 --> 05:56.685
Thank you. I'll be right back.

05:57.774 --> 06:01.421
And your pen-holder's gonna be perfect
for my tampons.

06:01.521 --> 06:02.433
I'm kidding.

06:02.558 --> 06:06.178
But seriously,
I'm gonna need a couple of drawers.

06:06.611 --> 06:08.851
I can do this.
It'll be fine.

06:08.878 --> 06:12.978
We'll just have to make sure
we keep things professional.

06:18.138 --> 06:21.998
God, I've been lugging that thing
all over the place.

06:30.695 --> 06:31.699
Oh, boy.

06:35.969 --> 06:36.952
<i>Machines...</i>

06:37.699 --> 06:40.152
<i>When you were little,
you wanted to be one.</i>

06:40.252 --> 06:42.845
<i>Now we're working
to make that happen</i>

06:42.945 --> 06:45.905
<i>by taking the best things
about people</i>

06:45.943 --> 06:48.783
<i>and the best things
about machines...</i>

06:50.548 --> 06:51.905
<i>And combing them</i>

06:52.364 --> 06:53.816
<i>into something strong</i>

06:53.916 --> 06:55.716
<i>and, we hope, loving...</i>

07:06.014 --> 07:10.122
<i>I wasn't the only one being affected
by the goo coming out of Johnny.</i>

07:10.222 --> 07:12.324
<i>All the scientists from
the biocomputer floor</i>

07:12.424 --> 07:14.124
<i>had been reassigned to other labs. </i>

07:14.224 --> 07:16.890
Why don't you go talk to her?
- Talk to her?

07:16.990 --> 07:19.778
Would you talk to a rainbow
or a sunset?

07:19.878 --> 07:22.759
If I wanted to get it on
with refracted light, I would.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.479
If only I was a worm.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.763
I could cut myself in two
and date my lower half.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.660
We all wish we were worms, Lem,

07:28.760 --> 07:32.500
but that's never going to happen.
Now get in there.

07:41.179 --> 07:42.124
I'm Lem.

07:43.077 --> 07:45.857
I'm lucy.
I work upstairs in robotics.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.488
I shouldn't be talking to you.

07:48.588 --> 07:52.508
I just created a robot-boyfriend
who gets very jealous.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.305
Wait. I'm kidding.

07:54.973 --> 07:55.933
We broke up.

07:56.864 --> 07:58.811
That's funny.
You're funny.

07:59.497 --> 08:00.846
I can be funny.

08:01.493 --> 08:04.867
Want to see me throw something
at that guy or touch the ceiling?

08:04.967 --> 08:06.223
That's lame.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.000
But it's cute you're trying
so hard to impress me.

08:11.375 --> 08:13.409
You should meet me
for a drink tonight

08:13.509 --> 08:17.609
after I've dinner with my mom
and pretend to go to bed.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.878
<i>One drip on a desk.</i>

08:18.978 --> 08:21.970
<i>That's all it took
to throw things out of whack.</i>

08:22.070 --> 08:26.710
<i>And when that happens,
it changes the way you look at things.</i>

08:28.690 --> 08:30.670
Are you staring at my butt?

08:32.330 --> 08:34.337
No, your butt
is in my staring place.

08:34.437 --> 08:36.707
So technically, it's staring at me.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.048
Sorry.
It's from a small town.

08:39.142 --> 08:41.787
It's never seen a big businessman
like you before.

08:41.886 --> 08:43.870
Well, tell it to act
more professional.

08:43.970 --> 08:46.370
It's making a spectacle of itself.

08:54.592 --> 08:57.605
I was worried about sharing an office
with someone I'm attracted to,

08:57.705 --> 08:58.836
but the problem

08:58.961 --> 09:01.719
is being stuck with someone
with such annoying work habits.

09:01.819 --> 09:03.958
Mama. Say...

09:08.423 --> 09:12.703
Look, he's trying to say it,
only he pronounces it Maw-maw.

09:14.027 --> 09:14.982
Excuse me.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.333
I need to get some word one.
Maybe you should also.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.715
And I'm sure the fish
has things to do, too,

09:20.815 --> 09:23.046
like protect his treasure
from that diver.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.786
First of all, "the fish" has a name.

09:25.816 --> 09:26.899
He's Macgyver.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.401
That's right...
Macgyver and the diver.

09:29.501 --> 09:31.494
And second of all,
they're gay-married.

09:31.594 --> 09:34.153
And don't you dare judge...
- You do know I need your report

09:34.253 --> 09:37.225
on the hypersonic sound project
in two days?

09:37.325 --> 09:39.485
Look who's all, "get to work."

09:40.864 --> 09:43.321
Macgyver, why do you think
Ted's like that?

09:43.421 --> 09:46.546
Who do you think
he didn't get enough love from?

09:46.646 --> 09:48.566
That's right... His maw-maw.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.000
<i>Are you ready?</i>

09:51.823 --> 09:52.842
<i>I'm ready.</i>

09:53.335 --> 09:54.743
<i>Are you ready?</i>

09:55.655 --> 09:56.687
<i>I'm ready.</i>

09:56.867 --> 09:58.547
<i>Is your report ready?</i>

09:58.862 --> 10:00.422
<i>No, it's not ready.</i>

10:00.517 --> 10:05.097
<i>- I should have your fish do it
- He can only write "mama"</i>

10:06.745 --> 10:08.675
I had a great time last night.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.915
I've never been
to a dance-aoke bar before.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.953
Technically, it's a karaoke bar,

10:14.053 --> 10:16.953
but I like to bring it
when I perform.

10:17.121 --> 10:17.949
Listen,

10:18.119 --> 10:23.059
I had a great time also. I'm just
so sorry about the way it ended.

10:25.512 --> 10:26.652
Good night, Lem.

10:27.474 --> 10:28.502
Good night.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.374
You were allergic to my perfume.

10:38.532 --> 10:40.692
It could've happened to anyone.

10:41.806 --> 10:43.801
I'm not wearing any now.

10:48.061 --> 10:49.194
How you doin'?

10:49.319 --> 10:52.339
I'm Brody.
I was assigned to this office.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.066
With this beautiful, exotic lady.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.381
I'm not exotic.
I'm asian.

10:57.877 --> 11:00.171
There are more of us
than there are of you,

11:00.271 --> 11:02.563
so statistically,
you're the exotic one.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.929
What? Wait... What?

11:05.521 --> 11:08.421
You heard
the statistically average lady.

11:12.951 --> 11:14.943
Is it possible
to overdose on antacid?

11:15.043 --> 11:16.311
I hope the answer's yes.

11:16.411 --> 11:18.406
Here. Let's find out together.

11:18.506 --> 11:20.497
They just yelled at me upstairs.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.862
They're mad because this leak is hurting
productivity in our department.

11:23.962 --> 11:26.071
Someone even suggested making
the cubicle workers

11:26.171 --> 11:28.421
do their jobs in hazmat suits.
- That seems a little...

11:28.521 --> 11:30.428
Save your breath.
They told me no.

11:30.528 --> 11:32.748
I need this leak fixednow, Ted.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.065
I'm not waiting on Bhamba.
He's so stressed,

11:35.165 --> 11:38.776
he spends his day staring out the window
he drew on the wall of his office.

11:38.876 --> 11:40.978
I put Lem and Phil on it.
Believe me,

11:41.078 --> 11:43.838
no one wants this problem solved
more than I do.

11:43.938 --> 11:48.087
Is Ken having trouble with Barbie
in their Malibu dream house?

11:48.187 --> 11:50.903
I must say, the thought of you guys
in there together sickens me.

11:51.003 --> 11:52.085
You're jealous?

11:52.325 --> 11:55.340
Jealous implies I can't have
something I want.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.607
This is more like
if someone borrows my stapler...

11:58.707 --> 12:00.413
Even if I'm not using the thing,

12:00.513 --> 12:05.393
I still don't like the thought
of someone else pounding away on it.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.216
See that?
She's working for ten minutes now.

12:10.316 --> 12:12.417
I'm actually getting some...
- I need a break!

12:12.517 --> 12:14.085
Tell me about your ex-wife.

12:14.185 --> 12:16.433
Lovely woman. Sex was good.
Crazy as hell.

12:16.533 --> 12:17.611
Back to work.

12:17.779 --> 12:21.594
So she was crazy?
I'll bet that's why the sex was good.

12:21.694 --> 12:22.994
Why'd she leave?

12:23.120 --> 12:25.590
Sure, le t's talk about
my wife taking off one day,

12:25.690 --> 12:28.245
abandoning me and our child,
flying off to save the world

12:28.345 --> 12:30.697
while leaving the wreckage behind
of our broken family.

12:30.797 --> 12:32.365
That'll be a fun afternoon.

12:32.465 --> 12:36.011
It's not bad to go
to a sad place sometimes, Ted.

12:36.111 --> 12:38.444
And I hope you've talked
about your wife to someone.

12:38.544 --> 12:40.886
Because it's important to work
through relationship issues

12:40.986 --> 12:42.484
and figure out what went wrong.

12:42.584 --> 12:46.141
Otherwise, you'll just keep making
the same mistakes over and over again.

12:46.241 --> 12:47.801
You know what I mean?

12:50.937 --> 12:54.791
I guess I hit a nerve.
He's got more problems than you,

12:54.891 --> 12:56.811
and you poop in your air.

13:00.199 --> 13:02.776
Now I know why Barbie and Ken
are sold separately.

13:02.876 --> 13:04.616
Can I move in with you?

13:07.231 --> 13:10.107
It was impossibl to get work done
with Linda in my office,

13:10.207 --> 13:12.066
so I moved in with Veronica.

13:12.166 --> 13:16.746
She and I both appreciate a quiet,
professional work environment.

13:20.554 --> 13:25.254
Sorry, I couldn't get any workone
with that hair screaming at me.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.125
The leak has put Veronica
under a little stress, too.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.194
The next day,
the stress intensified,

13:30.294 --> 13:33.554
and so did Veronica's way
of coping with it.

13:40.801 --> 13:43.092
Still, it's easier
than being with Linda.

13:43.192 --> 13:45.245
Besides, Veronica goes
to a lot of meetings,

13:45.345 --> 13:47.505
so I get the place to myself.

13:47.850 --> 13:49.977
They've decided upstairs
to make me the fall guy

13:50.077 --> 13:52.077
for this whole biocomputer thing...

13:52.177 --> 13:53.984
A project that wasn't even mine.

13:54.084 --> 13:57.208
It just dripped on my floor.
- That's a gun.

13:57.308 --> 13:59.072
Blame the bird
that dropped the turd...

13:59.172 --> 14:01.214
You have a gun.
- Not the hat that got the splat.

14:01.314 --> 14:02.802
That's a basic rule of business.

14:02.902 --> 14:06.882
Don't these people know anything?
- What are you doing?

14:10.421 --> 14:11.681
That always works.

14:12.143 --> 14:13.796
Mother...
- You're a guest.

14:13.896 --> 14:18.356
I can't have you flinching
every time I shoot a gun in here.

14:22.154 --> 14:25.414
So it's not really working out
with Veronica.

14:28.347 --> 14:30.520
Have you been able to plug the leak
in the biocomputer?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.731
Because I need it plugged.
I need it plugged bad.

14:32.831 --> 14:35.626
According to my wife,
I'm not good at reading men, either,

14:35.726 --> 14:37.830
but it sounds like...
- I can't go back to my office

14:37.930 --> 14:40.276
because Linda's work habits
drive me crazy.

14:40.376 --> 14:42.824
And I can't say anything because then
we'd just get in a fight,

14:42.924 --> 14:44.664
and I don't want to fight.
I like Linda.

14:44.764 --> 14:46.996
I just need things back
the way they were!

14:47.096 --> 14:49.262
I suppose...
- Just do it.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.993
Are you avoiding me?

14:53.118 --> 14:55.253
It's the opposite.
I've been looking for you.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.463
I've been in your office.
- I know.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.762
I feel like things have gotten weird
since I moved in,

14:59.862 --> 15:03.633
and I think I know why.
Maybe we should talk about it.

15:03.733 --> 15:05.578
I'd like to.
I can't.

15:06.529 --> 15:10.089
I'm in the middle of... Something.
So... Darn it.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.248
Christmas was great

15:17.348 --> 15:19.819
'cause it was a real white Christmas.
It was just awesome.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.989
This polymer should plug the leak,

15:22.089 --> 15:23.570
but it's a temporary fix.

15:23.670 --> 15:25.477
Unless we figure out
why it's leaking,

15:25.577 --> 15:29.857
it's gonna keep happening.
- Look at that gorgeous creature.

15:30.179 --> 15:33.199
I have to stop him
from getting my girl.

15:34.159 --> 15:36.478
God. Lem, you're using science
for no good.

15:36.578 --> 15:39.631
We took an oath
we would try to do that less.

15:39.731 --> 15:43.156
I'm cranking this all the way up.
I'll bet brody is a lot less suave

15:43.256 --> 15:46.876
when he's covered in his own vomit.
I know I am!

15:51.154 --> 15:52.393
That's gross.

15:53.369 --> 15:56.516
Oh, my god, I emptied
the stomach of the woman I love.

15:56.616 --> 15:58.451
Okay, fellas, time's up.

15:58.576 --> 16:00.694
We're gonna go fix the biocomputer.
Follow me.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.613
But the polymer
still needs more testing.

16:02.713 --> 16:05.500
If you come with me now, I won't ask
what you did to that poor woman...

16:05.600 --> 16:07.880
To make her throw up like that.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.259
Fair enough.

16:10.446 --> 16:11.469
My god...

16:12.175 --> 16:13.534
It's beautiful.

16:15.364 --> 16:18.324
Half computer,
half living organic matter.

16:19.243 --> 16:20.743
That looks like barf.

16:21.979 --> 16:23.091
I Miss lucy.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.005
I just want to shoot
this thing full of polymer

16:26.105 --> 16:28.705
and get on with our lives.
- Wait.

16:29.365 --> 16:31.678
Since it hasn't been tested,
there's a 20% chance

16:31.778 --> 16:34.492
that when the polymer interacts
with the corrosive acids,

16:34.592 --> 16:36.754
the entire thing could explode.

16:37.399 --> 16:38.714
Let's see, 20%...

16:39.123 --> 16:42.683
And there's a 100% chance
Linda's still in my office.

16:42.783 --> 16:44.603
Let's do it.
Stand back!

16:50.383 --> 16:52.929
There was a 1-in-5 chance
that this could end badly,

16:53.029 --> 16:58.569
but that was a chance I was willing
to take to get my life back to normal.

16:58.643 --> 16:59.415
Wait!

17:00.336 --> 17:02.013
I know what's causing the problem.

17:02.113 --> 17:06.393
The biocomputer has an ulcer.
That's why it's leaking fluid.

17:06.510 --> 17:09.238
This thing has been running nonstop
for three years.

17:09.338 --> 17:12.008
It's stressed.
But since it's a biocomputer,

17:12.108 --> 17:13.858
instead of crashing like a machine,

17:13.959 --> 17:16.545
it's secreting acids
like a living organism.

17:16.645 --> 17:18.048
How do you know that?

17:18.147 --> 17:21.528
I realized it
when I saw you chugging antacid.

17:23.798 --> 17:26.464
I guess I've also been under
a lot of pressure.

17:26.564 --> 17:28.992
With Linda moving in my office
and all, it's...

17:29.092 --> 17:31.012
It's been a difficult time.

17:31.610 --> 17:32.930
So what do we do?

17:33.227 --> 17:34.274
We're men.

17:34.399 --> 17:38.170
We ignore your vulnerable moment.
- I meant about the biocomputer.

17:38.270 --> 17:41.139
All it needs is a way to communicate
when it's stressed.

17:41.239 --> 17:43.767
I can write a program
that's triggered by an acid buildup,

17:43.867 --> 17:47.487
a sort of acid interface,
or "ass-face" for short.

17:48.550 --> 17:53.730
I'm not sure these abbreviations
are really worth the time they're saving

17:53.781 --> 17:55.451
As much as I hate to admit it,

17:55.551 --> 17:57.361
we have something in common.

17:57.461 --> 18:00.033
We both get stressed out
when we don't communicate.

18:00.133 --> 18:04.533
Plus, I'm pretty sure neither of us
can fold a fitted sheet.

18:04.731 --> 18:05.931
We need to talk.

18:06.397 --> 18:09.528
Not now, Ted. I'm working.
- Now you're working?

18:09.628 --> 18:12.768
I've got this report due tomorrow,
remember?

18:13.891 --> 18:17.091
But, fine, what did you want
to talk about?

18:17.407 --> 18:20.187
Your work habits
and how bad they are

18:20.239 --> 18:22.159
and how much that bugs me.

18:23.430 --> 18:25.250
This can wait.
Go ahead.

18:26.535 --> 18:29.495
To begin with,
your work habits are bad.

18:29.723 --> 18:32.003
And in conclusion, that bugs me.

18:32.756 --> 18:35.016
That's not why you've been so tense.

18:35.116 --> 18:37.576
You know why you've been so tense?

18:38.407 --> 18:40.561
Does it have anything
to do with your workabits?

18:40.661 --> 18:42.661
Damn.
- You still want me.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.555
I'm in your staring place,

18:44.655 --> 18:46.963
but you're still too wounded
by your ex-wife leaving you

18:47.063 --> 18:49.465
to know what to do with that.
So you don't want to be with me

18:49.565 --> 18:51.391
because you're afraid
I might leave, too.

18:51.491 --> 18:53.946
You flirt with me,
you stare at my butt,

18:54.046 --> 18:57.343
but that's as far as you can go.
- As far as I can go? You flirt, too.

18:57.443 --> 19:00.396
You're the one that has a boyfriend.
- You're the one that has a...

19:00.496 --> 19:02.476
Good... that's a good point.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.495
But six weeks ago,
I did not have a boyfriend,

19:04.595 --> 19:07.055
and you still wouldn't be with me.

19:07.343 --> 19:10.213
Fine. From now on, no more flirting.

19:10.338 --> 19:12.018
We keep it professional.

19:12.128 --> 19:13.818
Fine with me... boss.

19:13.987 --> 19:14.738
Good.

19:15.143 --> 19:17.724
Starting now,
you're just another butt-less coworker.

19:17.824 --> 19:18.555
Good.

19:18.680 --> 19:22.240
Then the door has nothing
to hit on my way out.

19:32.629 --> 19:35.519
I found your sweater in the lab,
so I had it dry-cleaned.

19:35.619 --> 19:37.179
That was nice of you.

19:38.362 --> 19:40.822
Listen, lucy, about what happened...

19:40.972 --> 19:43.932
Look, it's the exotic dude
from the lab.

19:45.557 --> 19:47.557
Come on, babe.
Tea's ready.

19:48.651 --> 19:49.451
Sorry.

19:50.126 --> 19:52.748
I thought he was a jerk at first,
but then when I threw up,

19:52.848 --> 19:55.808
he brought me home
and took care of me.

19:55.943 --> 19:56.843
Weird?

19:57.771 --> 20:01.631
If I hadn't gotten sick,
this never would've happened.

20:02.888 --> 20:05.848
So you owe me $12
for the dry cleaning.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.183
Thanks to Phil,
the biocomputer healed

20:08.283 --> 20:10.386
and was brought back
to the land of the half-living.

20:10.486 --> 20:14.906
More importantly, everyone could
go back to their own work spaces.

20:15.006 --> 20:17.226
<i>For some, it was bittersweet.</i>

20:19.661 --> 20:21.901
You'll always have
your sneeze-related head injury.

20:22.001 --> 20:23.012
<i>For others,</i>

20:23.180 --> 20:26.860
<i>getting their office back
was julie-andrews sweet.</i>

20:31.229 --> 20:33.976
You did this, Phil.
And to recognize your efforts,

20:34.076 --> 20:36.802
we're promoting you
to senior lab associate.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.422
I was promoted to that a year ago.

20:39.502 --> 20:40.415
Really?

20:40.781 --> 20:43.921
You shouldn't have been.
You probably owe the company some money.

20:44.021 --> 20:46.121
I'll check into that for you.

20:47.432 --> 20:48.432
Thank you.

20:52.062 --> 20:54.561
Here are the test results
for the sound transmitter.

20:54.661 --> 20:56.080
Your presentation is at 3:00,

20:56.180 --> 20:58.418
you have a few hours to look it over.
- Thank you.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.198
Very professionally done.

21:00.272 --> 21:03.802
My process is just different than yours,
but I am professional,

21:03.902 --> 21:07.228
and I believe professionalism
is our new mandate?

21:07.328 --> 21:10.128
Thank you letting me share your office,
and good afternoon.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.479
Good afternoon.
