09:22.431 --> 09:23.519
- I don't know. I'm gonna see

09:23.563 --> 09:25.434
if I can track down
her friend Misty.

09:25.477 --> 09:28.350
Um, see where people
from the encampment are buying.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.308
- Why don't I come with you?

09:30.352 --> 09:32.528
Got a five-hour pharmacy
and therapeutics Zoom

09:32.572 --> 09:34.312
this morning
I'm sure I won't be missed at.

09:34.356 --> 09:37.054
- I appreciate the offer, Will,
but it's okay--I'll be fine.

09:37.098 --> 09:39.143
- Oh, I don't doubt that.

09:39.187 --> 09:41.363
But everyone can use
a little backup, right?

09:43.539 --> 09:44.584
Even the Hammer.

09:47.412 --> 09:50.415
- You call me that again,
I leave you on the curb.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.202
- Copy. Let me get dressed.
I'll meet you out front.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.246
- Okay.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.035
- How you doing?
I'm Dr. Charles.

10:01.078 --> 10:03.341
You must be Uncle Joe.
- Yeah.

10:03.385 --> 10:07.955
Well, Dylan here says that
you're a master of your craft.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.304
So that's a ringing
endorsement.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.219
- You know, he's enthusiastic,

10:11.262 --> 10:13.177
so we try and look
past his faults.

10:13.221 --> 10:14.352
- All right.

10:14.396 --> 10:16.180
I'll let you two comedians
get at it.

10:17.704 --> 10:20.576
- What's, um--
what's been going on?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.143
- Well, didn't Dylan
tell you already?

10:22.186 --> 10:23.579
- You know,
just the broad strokes.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.234
He said that you were having
a rough time at work.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.975
- Honestly, Doc,
I was hoping you might

10:28.018 --> 10:29.629
recommend some sort of meds.

10:29.672 --> 10:32.240
- Oh, okay.
- My wife Marsha--

10:32.283 --> 10:34.590
well, I don't know if she
calls herself that anymore.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.984
She had me move out
when things hit the fan.

10:37.027 --> 10:38.986
- Oh, boy.
I'm sorry to hear that.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.422
- Anyways, she always thought
that I should be on

10:40.465 --> 10:42.598
some sort of pill, you know?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.600
Help even me out a bit.
- Right.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.036
- Guess cops are allowed
to take them now

10:46.080 --> 10:48.082
with a doctor's note.
I don't know.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.084
Maybe if she heard
that I was finally listening

10:50.127 --> 10:52.347
to her advice for once,
she might let me move back in.

10:52.390 --> 10:56.307
- Okay. Look, we can absolutely
talk about medication.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.483
But I guess I just--I want
to hear a little bit more

10:58.527 --> 10:59.789
about what's going on.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.661
For instance, you say
that your wife thinks

11:01.704 --> 11:04.489
that maybe medication
might even you out.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.100
What do you think
she means by that?

11:06.143 --> 11:08.058
- No, no, no, no.
Look, it's not like

11:08.102 --> 11:09.625
I'm some sort of loose cannon.
All right?

11:09.669 --> 11:12.454
It's just what happened
with the rookie,

11:12.497 --> 11:14.021
I know I crossed the line.

11:14.064 --> 11:15.718
I should never have
put hands on him.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.633
- I think you're--
you're probably right

11:17.677 --> 11:19.417
about that last part,
but I mean, look, I get it.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.419
I've been doing this
for over 30 years.

11:21.463 --> 11:24.205
I wouldn't want some first year
resident mouthing off of me.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.511
- Exactly. These kids
these days, no respect.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.470
Punk got off easy.

11:28.513 --> 11:29.689
- Hmm.

11:34.519 --> 11:35.999
- Hey.

11:38.132 --> 11:40.047
Is everything okay?

11:40.090 --> 11:42.310
- All good.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.225
- Vanessa?

11:46.531 --> 11:48.098
Are you all right?

11:48.142 --> 11:52.581
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
Food poisoning, I think.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.496
I stopped
by a sketchy food truck

11:54.539 --> 11:57.629
last night after work.
My mistake.

11:57.673 --> 12:00.415
- Oh, no. Do you feel
well enough to work?

12:00.458 --> 12:03.592
- Actually,
maybe I should go home.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.376
- Oh. Sure.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.770
Let me just check
the testing schedule.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.164
- You know,
can I just reschedule that

12:10.207 --> 12:12.340
for another day or something?
- Unfortunately, no.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.342
They take a real hard line
on these things.

12:14.385 --> 12:16.561
Anyone who misses
is automatically subject

12:16.605 --> 12:18.041
to investigation.

12:18.085 --> 12:20.522
But no worries, I could just
move up your time slot,

12:20.565 --> 12:22.437
and you can go home
right after.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.700
- You know what, I, uh,
I think I'll stay.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.571
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:26.615 --> 12:27.834
I think I probably
actually got the--

12:27.877 --> 12:29.792
the worst out of my system.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.273
- Okay, well, try to take it
easy and rest between patients.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.231
Oh, and don't forget
to hydrate.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.624
- I got it, Maggie.
Thank you.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.060
- Okay.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.724
- Hey, morning, Dr. Blake.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.595
Apologies I couldn't scrub
in last night.

12:50.639 --> 12:53.120
- You missed
a once-in-a-year case.

12:53.163 --> 12:55.775
- Oh, well.
My rule of thumb--

12:55.818 --> 12:57.646
if I wouldn't drive,
I shouldn't operate, right?

13:01.868 --> 13:03.826
- Maybe I made
a miscalculation.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.785
- I beg your pardon?

13:05.828 --> 13:08.570
- I thought you were committed,
serious about the opportunity.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.572
- I am very much so.

13:10.615 --> 13:14.532
- Just not enough to prioritize
it above drinking and partying?

13:14.576 --> 13:16.491
- With all due respect,
Dr. Blake,

13:16.534 --> 13:18.275
I wasn't on call last night.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.321
- Okay.
If you want to shadow me,

13:20.364 --> 13:22.802
when opportunity knocks,
consider yourself on call.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.282
Doesn't matter the hour.

13:25.326 --> 13:28.590
And if that doesn't work
for you, you just let me know.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.113
Sooner rather than later.

13:30.157 --> 13:31.898
I don't like having
my time wasted.

13:39.949 --> 13:43.170
- Hey, Crockett, I just got
Marcus Clemens' CT back.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.128
No solid organ injury
and no free fluid,

13:45.172 --> 13:48.088
but a clear abdominal wall
hernia with incarcerated bowel.

13:48.131 --> 13:52.005
- Yeah. Looks like he needs
an emergent laparotomy.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.702
All right,
I'll call the OR now.

13:53.745 --> 13:56.618
- Right now?
You think that's a good idea?

13:56.661 --> 13:58.925
He's got a pulmonary contusion.
His sats aren't great.

13:58.968 --> 14:00.143
- Well, it's not opportune.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.884
But if we wait,
we risk the bowel dying.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.886
Yeah. This is Dr. Marcel.
Give me scheduling.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.932
- What about giving
manual reduction another shot?

14:05.975 --> 14:08.238
I had this old-school surgeon
on my first deployment.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.023
She taught me this method
she swears by.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.634
- Hold on for me.
- Heat followed by ice

14:12.677 --> 14:14.592
and you kind of corkscrew
the bowel back into place.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.725
- I'm telling you, Ethan,
the sucker's stuck.

14:16.768 --> 14:19.815
It's not budging, and the more
we piss off that bowel,

14:19.859 --> 14:21.382
the greater the risk of
strangulation and perforation.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.906
You know that.
- Let me give it a shot.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.300
I'm not trying to undermine
your efforts in any way, man.

14:26.343 --> 14:29.303
I just--I saw this work
on the ship dozens of times

14:29.346 --> 14:31.696
when surgery wasn't an option.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.831
- Yeah. Let me call you back.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.180
You know manual reduction

14:37.224 --> 14:38.921
is a physically
involved procedure.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.270
- Yeah, I know.
I'll be careful.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.011
- I understand that.

14:42.055 --> 14:46.102
But with your injury, I mean--
- Hey, let me worry about that.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.935
- I'm sorry, Ethan,
but when it has the potential

14:52.979 --> 14:54.763
to negatively impact
the patient's outcome,

14:54.806 --> 14:57.287
I can't do that.

14:57.331 --> 15:00.160
I'm gonna book the OR.

15:02.292 --> 15:03.946
Yeah, give me scheduling.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.689
Yeah, laparotomy 2.

15:08.777 --> 15:10.344
- Didn't sound to me
like this Sergeant Kerry

15:10.387 --> 15:12.259
has too many fans on the force.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.000
I mean, is he giving
everybody a hard time?

15:14.043 --> 15:16.176
- No. No, no.
This guy's had it out for me

15:16.219 --> 15:17.960
ever since he got his stripes.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.875
Listen, get this, every year,

15:19.919 --> 15:21.964
we all get uniform allowance,
right? 1,800 bucks.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.140
This year, mine doesn't
even hit my bank account.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.099
- Not a clerical
oversight, huh?

15:26.142 --> 15:29.319
- Oh, no. Kerry keeps track
of every penny, where it goes.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.452
He did this on purpose
just to snub me.

15:31.495 --> 15:32.888
I mean,
you should see this prick

15:32.932 --> 15:35.195
sitting up there at his castle
at Mount Greenwood.

15:35.238 --> 15:37.110
Then they're at Mastro's
every Friday night,

15:37.153 --> 15:38.807
dining off the company dime.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.984
- Every Friday?
- Like clockwork.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.117
And in the meantime,
this jerk's cut me

15:44.160 --> 15:45.988
out of overtime
by taking me off-a patrol.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.294
- But I mean, Joe, that's--

15:47.337 --> 15:49.078
that's a decision
you can appeal, right?

15:49.122 --> 15:51.211
- And give him the pleasure
of shooting me down, huh?

15:51.254 --> 15:53.169
Humiliating me again?
Forget it.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.823
But I'm gonna tell you what,

15:54.866 --> 15:56.825
if he doesn't put me back
on patrol soon,

15:56.868 --> 15:59.349
I can't say
what's gonna happen.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.351
- What--
what do you mean by that?

16:02.787 --> 16:04.485
Joe, what do you--
what do you mean by that?

16:04.528 --> 16:06.139
- Listen, Doc, are we going
to do these meds, huh?

16:06.182 --> 16:07.749
I gotta get going here.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.015
- Misty saw my mom last night.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.321
Said she was headed
to a pawn shop.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.323
She's trying to hawk
a gold bracelet,

16:16.366 --> 16:19.239
which confirms
she's looking for fast cash.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.849
- Where do you think she got
a gold bracelet?

16:20.892 --> 16:23.112
- It's mine. Um, she must have
taken it with her.

16:23.156 --> 16:24.461
She's not a thief.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.724
She acts out
when she's desperate.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.161
Anyway,
Misty gave me some addresses.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.032
places where people are buying,
shooting galleries.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.469
I thought we could start there.
- Hey, if you want,

16:32.513 --> 16:35.298
I can call my brother Jay,
get help locating her.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.083
- Will, if the cops find her
with drugs in her possession,

16:37.126 --> 16:39.085
they'll lock her up.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.174
- Look, I don't want this
to sound harsh,

16:41.217 --> 16:44.307
but maybe that's the wakeup
call she needs.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.048
- She's already done time.

16:46.092 --> 16:49.269
Served a one year sentence
back in 2003.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.923
I can't put her
through that again.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.106
- Whoa, whoa.
Hey, Joe, where are you going?

17:00.149 --> 17:02.021
I thought we were gonna talk
a little bit more.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.979
Buddy, again,
medication is absolutely--

17:04.023 --> 17:05.154
- Hey. I'm good. Okay?

17:05.198 --> 17:06.416
Thanks for the help, Doc.
I gotta split.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.331
- Hey, let's at least
try and find Dylan.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.029
I--I know that he wanted
to say goodbye to you.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.291
- I hassled the kid
enough last night.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.206
I won't bother him
while he's saving lives.

17:13.249 --> 17:14.946
Take care, Doc.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.387
- Hey, Marcus.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.258
Techs will be by shortly
to transport you upstairs,

17:22.302 --> 17:24.521
and Dr. Marcel
will meet you in the OR.

17:24.565 --> 17:27.350
- Oh, already? Okay.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.396
- Were you able to get
in touch with your wife?

17:29.439 --> 17:30.875
- Yeah.

17:30.919 --> 17:32.877
She was hoping she could
get here before the surgery,

17:32.921 --> 17:35.097
but I told her not to come.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.099
Elaine's eight months along
with our first

17:37.143 --> 17:42.104
and she's got preeclampsia,
so it's...too risky.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.193
- Ah, that's tough.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.415
- She could go into labor
at any moment,

17:48.458 --> 17:50.895
and if I'm not there,
she just might not--

17:52.288 --> 17:54.464
Anyways, uh-

17:54.508 --> 17:57.424
not like I got
any other options, right?

17:57.467 --> 17:59.904
Guess surgery is it.

17:59.948 --> 18:03.169
<i>♪</i>

18:03.212 --> 18:06.346
- And the patient was referred
by Dr. Scott.

18:06.389 --> 18:09.305
- Yeah.
Close family friend, okay?

18:09.349 --> 18:10.959
Calls him uncle.

18:11.002 --> 18:15.094
- Mm, Understood.
You said he sounded paranoid?

18:15.137 --> 18:17.835
- I mean, maybe even
a little delusional.

18:17.879 --> 18:21.187
- Did he make any direct
threats against this sergeant?

18:21.230 --> 18:23.145
- Not explicitly. But, I mean,
he's smarter than that.

18:23.189 --> 18:26.148
He did, however,
describe in surprising detail

18:26.192 --> 18:28.281
the habits of the sergeant
and his wife.

18:28.324 --> 18:30.239
I mean, I'm pretty sure
he's stalking him.

18:30.283 --> 18:34.156
- Yeah. But without
an explicit, eminent threat,

18:34.200 --> 18:35.853
you can't commit him.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.986
A judge won't allow it.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.205

18:39.248 --> 18:40.771
I have no way to force him
into treatment,

18:40.815 --> 18:44.340
which leaves one option,
which is to alert the sergeant.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.952
I mean, surely, I have
an ethical responsibility

18:47.996 --> 18:51.391

of--of threats.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.610

18:53.654 --> 18:55.177
And yet I hate going that way.

around first responders

18:58.049 --> 18:59.877

18:59.921 --> 19:01.575

attacking someone--

19:11.019 --> 19:13.369

20:06.074 --> 20:08.294

20:10.426 --> 20:13.647
I've been taking Adderall
for the past couple of weeks

20:13.690 --> 20:16.258
to stay on top of work.
And now with this drug test--

20:16.302 --> 20:18.739
- If you have a prescription,
he can't penalize you.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.958
- No, I--I know. I--

20:21.002 --> 20:23.134
I don't have a prescription.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.267
I know! I know.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.573
It's just because
I've been so tired

20:26.616 --> 20:29.097
and overwhelmed with work
and--and med school.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.534
I know it's no excuse.
But everyone does it, Maggie.

20:31.578 --> 20:33.101
I took a pill this morning,

20:33.144 --> 20:34.494
and as soon as I found out
about the drug test,

20:34.537 --> 20:36.626
I--I threw it up right away.
But--

20:36.670 --> 20:38.367
- If you threw it up
immediately,

20:38.411 --> 20:41.588
it wouldn't have metabolized.
So you're fine for the test.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.416
- I took one last night.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.983
And the half-life
of an Adderall is ten hours.

20:46.027 --> 20:49.030
- It takes a day to...

20:49.073 --> 20:50.553
