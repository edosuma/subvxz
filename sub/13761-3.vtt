WEBVTT

00:10.730 --> 00:13.070
So that's how we'll do it.
Roger, roger.

00:16.030 --> 00:18.130
Wow! The Blazemaker's
looking great.

00:18.170 --> 00:21.110
I bet you're the best
mechanic in the Outer Rim.

00:21.140 --> 00:25.080
Well, I don't like to brag, but...
yeah, that's what they say.

00:25.110 --> 00:28.910
Still, I bet you can't adjust
the engine timing one-handed.

00:28.950 --> 00:31.750
What is it, rookie day?

00:39.820 --> 00:43.820
Sweet! But there's no way you can
replace the fuel pump blindfolded.

00:43.860 --> 00:46.770
Pfft. Come on.
Give me a real challenge.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.910
Think fast!

00:56.170 --> 00:58.900
Done!

01:00.080 --> 01:02.780
- What else you got?
- Hmm.

01:02.810 --> 01:05.840
Let's see you pull the nav
board wrapped in chains.

01:05.880 --> 01:09.750
Do I smell... chromium?

01:09.790 --> 01:11.860
What? Chromium?

01:11.890 --> 01:15.730
Where would we get chromium?
Rowan!

01:15.760 --> 01:17.800
Well, I-I don't know
what you're smelling,

01:17.830 --> 01:23.140
but it's definitely not a
classic N-1 Naboo starfighter.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.140
It's not a what?

01:32.940 --> 01:35.900
The most... beautiful...
ship...

01:35.950 --> 01:37.850
ever!

01:41.850 --> 01:43.810
Nose plugs.

01:43.850 --> 01:46.010
Why didn't I think
of nose plugs?

01:54.970 --> 01:58.840
The N-1 Naboo starfighter!
An Old Republic classic!

01:58.870 --> 02:00.940
Pristine! Still has the
chromium undercarriage.

02:00.970 --> 02:02.900
I must fly it!

02:02.940 --> 02:05.940
No! Kordi told me not to
let you anywhere near it.

02:05.980 --> 02:07.910
And how are you gonna stop me?

02:07.940 --> 02:11.840
Naare's been training me
for moments like this.

02:17.750 --> 02:20.080
Aw. The Force
is not with you.

02:20.120 --> 02:22.780
See ya!
No!

02:22.830 --> 02:25.130
Okay, so I want the engines
double steamed

02:25.160 --> 02:27.060
and then steamed again.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.070
No problem, Mr. Cooper.

02:29.100 --> 02:31.970
And... would you see if you
can recalibrate my astromech?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.100
He makes this sound.

02:33.140 --> 02:35.040
- See? It's disconcerting.
- Got it.

02:35.070 --> 02:39.030
Great. Now, I want the heat sinks
flushed, but use pure Kamino water.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.910
Okay? Don't think that I
don't know the difference

02:41.950 --> 02:43.850
between that and Dagobah sludge.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.950
'Cause a lot of people will charge you
for Kamino, and you get Dagobah sludge.

02:46.980 --> 02:50.910
- Of course. -Your reputation as
vintage vehicle experts is peerless.

02:50.950 --> 02:55.150
But honestly, um,
given the decor,

02:55.190 --> 02:56.790
I am a little bit skeptical.

02:56.830 --> 03:00.130
I assure you, sir, our staff
is nothing but professional.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.990
Get off me!
No way!

03:02.030 --> 03:03.960
- I got my orders!
- You're, oh, so little!

03:05.670 --> 03:08.640
But they can get pretty territorial
around their tool boxes.

03:08.670 --> 03:11.000
Can you excuse me for a moment?

03:11.040 --> 03:12.900
Rowan!

03:12.940 --> 03:15.900
You weren't supposed to let him see it.
Kordi, it's not his fault.

03:15.950 --> 03:17.980
- Rowan has a tell.
- What's his tell?

03:18.010 --> 03:19.880
He told me.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.890
Zander, you are not taking
that ship for a ride.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.920
It is worth more
than our entire shop.

03:24.960 --> 03:29.660
And Moneybags Wick Cooper is the first
customer we've had in a long time.

03:29.730 --> 03:30.860
Yoo-hoo!

03:30.890 --> 03:33.720
I have not completed my list
of excessive demands.

03:33.760 --> 03:37.690
I'll be right there, Mr. Money... uh... Mr.
Wick Cooper.

03:37.730 --> 03:39.730
Now get down from there, Zan...

03:41.070 --> 03:43.670
Blast!
This is gonna cost you.

03:43.710 --> 03:45.940
Me?
How is this my fault?

03:45.980 --> 03:47.950
You know he can't
control himself.

03:47.980 --> 03:49.920
Neither can I. I'm 12.

03:49.950 --> 03:52.880
Ah! You handle so smooth.

03:56.890 --> 04:00.690
Relax. Mechanics always take
a ship out for a test drive.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.650
I'm just doing my job.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.620
You think we'll ever
see him again?

04:08.670 --> 04:10.100
There he is!

04:10.130 --> 04:11.760
There he is!

04:11.800 --> 04:13.700
There he is.

04:13.740 --> 04:16.110
What is going on back here?
Where is my ship?

04:16.140 --> 04:18.079
- It's in the back.
- Where?

04:18.110 --> 04:21.079
Way in the back.
Like way, way in the back.

04:21.110 --> 04:23.970
You're craning, but I literally
don't see it anywhere.

04:24.010 --> 04:26.910
Exactly. We ensure
our client's privacy.

04:26.950 --> 04:29.990
So why don't you sit in here
and let us baby your baby?

04:30.020 --> 04:33.030
How long is this going to take?
Because I have a thing.

04:33.060 --> 04:36.830
Well, since we're being extra
careful, we're gonna need extra time.

04:36.860 --> 04:41.730
But we'll throw in a free wax and
buff with only the finest Bantha fur!

04:41.770 --> 04:42.930
Are you crazy?
That'll cost...

04:43.870 --> 04:46.810
I mean, of course.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.140
We'll totally do that.

04:49.170 --> 04:53.000
Should have gone
to Theed Hangars.

04:55.150 --> 04:57.980
Oh! An asteroid belt.

04:58.010 --> 05:00.040
I'd be wise to avoid that.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.910
But today, I'm not a wise man.

05:02.950 --> 05:06.820
I'm Zander Freemaker,
daredevil asteroid guy!

05:08.060 --> 05:11.860
Oh, relax. The way this baby
handles, I'm untouchable!

05:11.900 --> 05:13.830
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

05:17.830 --> 05:19.700
Am I killin' it, or what?

05:19.970 --> 05:22.870
Ah!

05:24.870 --> 05:27.670
Turn back?

05:27.710 --> 05:29.100
We're almost
all the way through.

05:29.150 --> 05:30.780
Now that you mention it.

05:30.810 --> 05:34.740
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

05:34.780 --> 05:38.080
Ha-ha!
I love this ship!

05:38.120 --> 05:41.950
Don't worry, Mr. Wick Cooper. Your
baby's in the best hands in the galaxy.

05:41.990 --> 05:44.050
Well, there's
your problem right there.

05:44.090 --> 05:47.920
The ionization blow-off
valves are all gummed up!

05:47.960 --> 05:49.890
We'll need to order
some new ones.

05:49.930 --> 05:51.930
Ooh, that's gonna take a while.

05:51.970 --> 05:53.970
And the manifold sprockets
are fused.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.870
That "a while"
just became "a stretch."

05:56.910 --> 06:00.780
The gyro-stabilizer's
completely shot.

06:00.810 --> 06:03.720
- Aaah! Ooh! -Now we're
talking "a good long time."

06:03.750 --> 06:05.680
Just fix it.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:15.060 --> 06:18.000
Too slow, space slug.

06:18.030 --> 06:21.030
Aw, what's the matter? You scared?
Gotta learn to live a little.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.030
Well, well.
What do we have here?

06:27.070 --> 06:30.940
An unsanctioned
A-wing drag race.

06:30.970 --> 06:34.740
I bet they didn't expect Zander
Freemaker, daredevil drag race guy.

06:34.780 --> 06:37.750
Hey! You think your crates
can keep up with an N-1?

06:37.780 --> 06:39.780
I don't!

06:43.820 --> 06:46.120
Oh, what are these jokers doing?

06:46.160 --> 06:49.130
Ah, you've got lasers.
I have lasers too.

06:52.060 --> 06:55.060
Aw, what?
Giving up already?

06:55.100 --> 06:57.070
Guess you couldn't handle
Zander Freemaker,

06:57.100 --> 06:59.000
the drag-racing,
blaster-firing guy!

07:00.670 --> 07:03.810
What is so important that you
have to interrupt my gloating?

07:05.880 --> 07:06.980
Huh?

07:07.010 --> 07:09.820
<i>Attention.
You are under arrest for...</i>

07:09.850 --> 07:13.720
<i>subversive acts
against the Empire.</i>

07:13.750 --> 07:16.720
What? I gotta
full throttle outta here.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.680
<i>Resist and face...</i>

07:18.720 --> 07:21.780
<i>disintegration
and/or vaporization.</i>

07:21.830 --> 07:26.000
Or maybe I'll just ease off
on my main thruster.

07:28.670 --> 07:31.070
Don't worry, Mr. Cooper.
The parts are on their way.

07:31.130 --> 07:33.090
In the meantime, our
customer service droid Roger

07:33.140 --> 07:35.910
will be happy to see
to your every need.

07:35.940 --> 07:38.080
Only thing I need is my ship.

07:38.110 --> 07:39.980
What about entertainment?

07:40.010 --> 07:42.810
Yes. Entertainment.
I'll go check on your ship.

07:42.850 --> 07:44.980
I've been working
on my autobiography,

07:45.010 --> 07:48.880
<i>The Roger Story.</i>

07:48.920 --> 07:51.890
- Would you like me to read it to you?
- Of course not!

07:51.920 --> 07:54.820
Oh, good. I'll get
some honest criticism.

07:54.860 --> 07:58.800
No one here wants to hurt my feelings,
so they just tell me it's lousy.

07:58.830 --> 08:03.640
Chapter One,
"Lo, I Am Manufactured."

08:03.670 --> 08:05.040
Yaah!

08:09.640 --> 08:12.080
- Any sign of Zander?
- Nope.

08:12.110 --> 08:14.080
<i>Incoming call.</i>

08:14.110 --> 08:17.880
<i>Hey, guys. What's going on?
Everything okay?</i>

08:17.910 --> 08:20.910
Zander! Where are you?
Where's the N-1?

08:20.950 --> 08:23.860
<i>Relax, Kordi. We're both
safe and sound on, um...</i>

08:23.890 --> 08:26.960
<i>the Imperial Star Destroyer</i>
Vendetta.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.860
- What?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

08:28.890 --> 08:30.890
<i>There's, you know, been
a little misunderstanding.</i>

08:30.930 --> 08:32.830
What misunderstanding?

08:32.860 --> 08:35.820
<i>I've, um, been
kind of... arrested.</i>

08:35.870 --> 08:38.799
<i>They think I'm a Rebel.</i>

08:38.840 --> 08:40.809
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

08:40.840 --> 08:42.840
This cannot be happening!

08:42.870 --> 08:46.070
<i>Look, I-I just need you two
to remember one thing.</i>

08:46.110 --> 08:48.650
- What is it?
<i>- Help me!</i>

08:50.080 --> 08:52.330
I am going to throttle Zander!

08:52.370 --> 08:55.340
- We've got to rescue him.
- Right. That's a great idea.

08:55.370 --> 08:57.340
That'll make
throttling him easier.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.610
But how are we going to get him
off an Imperial Star Destroyer?

09:00.640 --> 09:02.640
Naare!

09:02.680 --> 09:05.710
Oh, no. We are not going
to that nut-job Jedi.

09:05.750 --> 09:08.480
Can't we just get one
of those bounty hunters?

09:08.510 --> 09:10.580
Well, they charge money, so...

09:10.620 --> 09:12.450
Naare it is.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.440
<i>Incoming call</i>
<i>from Star Destroyer</i> Vendetta.

09:32.710 --> 09:34.680
<i>Agent Naare.</i>

09:34.710 --> 09:37.710
<i>Why have you not obtained
more Kyber Saber crystals?</i>

09:37.740 --> 09:40.640
<i>The Emperor grows impatient.</i>

09:40.680 --> 09:42.620
<i>And displeased.</i>

09:42.650 --> 09:45.550
<i>And frustrated.
And... hold on.</i>

09:45.590 --> 09:47.620
<i>I wrote down
a few more words here.</i>

09:47.650 --> 09:48.950
I must be cautious.

09:48.990 --> 09:52.490
If the boy suspected who I really
am, I would lose his trust.

09:52.530 --> 09:54.460
<i>Have you tried
Force choking him?</i>

09:54.490 --> 09:56.620
<i>I find it's an excellent way
to get results.</i>

09:56.660 --> 09:59.490
Naare? You here?

09:59.530 --> 10:02.490
- I must go. <i>-Do not hang up.
I have more words.</i>

10:02.540 --> 10:05.370
<i>Restless. Agitated.
Furious.</i>

10:05.410 --> 10:07.380
<i>Unhappy. Rage-filled...</i>

10:09.440 --> 10:11.440
Zander's in trouble.
We need your help.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.480
Of course. You can put
your trust in me.

10:14.510 --> 10:17.380
I am a Jedi, after all.
Now, where is he?

10:17.420 --> 10:20.760
Captured by the Empire
on the Star Destroyer <i>Vendetta.</i>

10:20.790 --> 10:23.760
On the other hand,
one less mouth to feed.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.360
Are you sure you're not
better off without him?

10:26.390 --> 10:27.720
Good point.
What?

10:27.760 --> 10:30.770
Oh, I get it.
This is a test.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.700
You're trying
to teach me something.

10:32.730 --> 10:34.690
That I can do this on my own.

10:34.730 --> 10:37.530
That I can become a Jedi
on my own.

10:37.570 --> 10:41.480
That I can find all those Kyber Saber
crystals on my own and save the...

10:41.510 --> 10:43.510
No. Those are mine!

10:43.580 --> 10:47.380
I mean... kidding!
I'd be happy to help.

10:47.410 --> 10:51.410
Great. And I know how we can get
aboard that Star Destroyer.

10:52.490 --> 10:55.490
I give you a TIE fighter.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.780
That's not a TIE fighter.

10:57.820 --> 11:01.820
No, it's a class "D" cargo container with
an engine and fuel cell on the back.

11:01.860 --> 11:05.660
But slap a couple of hex wings on it,
and no one will know the difference.

11:20.610 --> 11:23.580
If anyone asks, we thought
it was Wacky Ship Day.

11:23.620 --> 11:26.520
I'll take the Eclipse Fighter.

11:29.560 --> 11:32.460
Why did you disobey me?

11:32.490 --> 11:35.350
I told you
to chew more carefully.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.830
Thank you, Lord Vader.

11:37.860 --> 11:40.390
And not to let
the Rebels escape!

11:42.440 --> 11:44.740
Lord Vader. We've captured
one of the Rebel fighters.

11:44.770 --> 11:47.700
I know how much you enjoy using
the interrogation droid.

11:47.740 --> 11:48.840
Ooh! I do!

11:55.780 --> 11:58.610
<i>Incoming vessel.
Identify yourself.</i>

11:58.650 --> 12:02.510
Don't worry. I've got an Imperial
transponder that I salvaged from a wreck.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.590
Transmitting security clearance.

12:05.660 --> 12:07.600
<i>Security code not received.</i>

12:07.630 --> 12:09.500
<i>You have 10 seconds to transmit.</i>

12:09.530 --> 12:11.430
We should leave. Quickly.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.490
No, I can fix it.

12:15.540 --> 12:17.470
<i>Transmit, or face destruction</i>

12:17.500 --> 12:19.360
<i>in five, four...</i>

12:19.410 --> 12:20.780
Will you please turn back?
<i>three...</i>

12:20.810 --> 12:22.780
- Rowan, fix it now!
<i>- two, one.</i>

12:22.810 --> 12:24.450
Yah!

12:24.480 --> 12:26.820
<i>-Clearance authorized.</i>

12:28.750 --> 12:29.750
Yes!

12:38.790 --> 12:41.590
How's TK-429 Jr. doing?
Great!

12:41.630 --> 12:43.730
He's already a better shot
than his old man.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.620
Hard not to be.

12:45.670 --> 12:47.670
It's all clear.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.560
Aaah!
Hold it right there!

12:59.510 --> 13:03.310
Wow! How did you get past the
defenses without a transponder?

13:03.350 --> 13:05.790
- I used a cloaking device.
- On a ship that small?

13:05.820 --> 13:08.360
No time for questions!
Come along.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.760
Tell me everything you know
about the Rebellion.

13:15.800 --> 13:19.630
Uh, I'm pretty sure they're,
like, not on your side?

13:19.670 --> 13:22.770
Oh, I see.
You wish to play games.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.660
Bring in
the interrogation droid.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.710
Ah!

13:29.740 --> 13:32.600
My name is Zander Freemaker,
and I come from the Wheel!

13:32.650 --> 13:36.450
I like starships and pickles and Becky
Smoochenbacher from the Upper Ring!

13:36.480 --> 13:39.480
- It hasn't done anything
to you yet. -Oh.

13:39.520 --> 13:43.460
Now you will tell me everything
you know about the Rebellion.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.460
Ow! My name is
Zander Freemaker... Ouch!

13:46.490 --> 13:49.390
I come from the Wheel,
and I... Yeow!

13:49.430 --> 13:52.770
I like starships and
pickles and... Ow, ow, ow!

13:52.800 --> 13:55.440
And Becky Smoochenbacher
from the Upper Ring!

13:55.470 --> 13:58.840
Ah, by the way, keep the
Becky thing just between us.

13:58.870 --> 14:02.330
But the pickles... Do what you want.
I don't care.

14:02.380 --> 14:03.580
Huh.

14:07.610 --> 14:08.740
Ma'am.

14:08.780 --> 14:10.680
As you were.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.480
Wow.
How did you do that?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.560
Um... Jedi mind trick?

14:16.590 --> 14:18.460
Impressive.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.490
Thence they came, 1,200 Wookiees

14:20.530 --> 14:22.530
- trudging through
the swamps of Kashyyk.

14:22.560 --> 14:26.490
I still remember the screams,
the blaster fire,

14:26.530 --> 14:29.460
the horrible stench
of swampy Wookiee fur.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.460
If you are going to
force me to listen to this,

14:32.510 --> 14:35.410
can I at least get
a cup of caf or something?

14:35.440 --> 14:40.370
I got something better. This stuff got me
through the five-month Siege of Saleucami.

14:40.410 --> 14:41.810
I'll pour you a cup.

14:42.850 --> 14:45.650
Aaah!

14:45.690 --> 14:48.720
That is horrible!
What is this?

14:48.750 --> 14:51.680
Thirty-weight motor oil.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.650
You gonna finish that?

14:55.660 --> 14:58.520
Ahh.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.530
It's plastic, which is why I don't
need to spend money on hair product.

15:01.570 --> 15:03.500
Maybe it'll work for you.
I don't know.

15:03.540 --> 15:06.410
I don't even know if you
have hair under all that.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.380
Pure nonsense!

15:08.410 --> 15:13.350
He is either highly trained to resist
interrogation or a complete imbecile.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.350
Zander!

15:15.380 --> 15:17.340
I got this.
No time for that.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.380
I'll use my Jedi powers.

15:19.420 --> 15:21.690
Hey, is that a stormtrooper?
Where?

15:21.720 --> 15:23.650
Oh, look, I'm in.

15:25.660 --> 15:27.630
Guys!
You came to rescue me!

15:27.660 --> 15:29.760
No! We came to get
Wick Cooper's ship.

15:29.800 --> 15:33.670
I'd leave you here, but I need you
to fix the damage you've caused.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.640
- I'm confused. So you want
me to come, or... -Yes!

15:36.670 --> 15:39.640
Oh, thank you! I'm so sorry.
I gave into temptation.

15:39.670 --> 15:43.600
You guys had to risk your lives on a Star
Destroyer just to save my stupid butt.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.500
Come on. Let's move!

15:45.540 --> 15:48.510
Oh, hey, Naare.
Is that a new cape?

15:48.550 --> 15:50.490
Lookin' beautiful!

15:52.550 --> 15:55.450
The hangar's this way. We round
that corner, and we're...

15:58.420 --> 16:00.350
Toast. Were you
gonna say "toast"?

16:00.390 --> 16:02.420
Get 'em, Naa... re?

16:05.700 --> 16:09.500
Ah, the Rebel has brought
a cadre of spies with him.

16:09.540 --> 16:13.140
Perhaps we'll squeeze more
information out of your friends.

16:13.170 --> 16:14.570
We're not spies.

16:14.610 --> 16:18.410
We're just a couple of kids trying
to make it in the junk business.

16:18.440 --> 16:22.370
Seriously, here's our card
if you need anything.

16:22.420 --> 16:24.450
But, uh, can you scan that
and give it back?

16:24.480 --> 16:27.450
Kordi gets mad if I actually give them out.
They're not cheap.

16:27.490 --> 16:30.530
- Lies!
- Aw!

16:30.560 --> 16:33.330
You are traitors
and part of the Rebellion.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.360
We're not!
It's all my fault.

16:35.390 --> 16:39.160
This guy came in with the most
beautiful ship I'd ever seen,

16:39.200 --> 16:41.170
and I just had to fly it.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.370
And those jerks in the
A-wings wanted to race.

16:43.400 --> 16:47.270
The next minute I was in the middle
of a battle and I didn't know.

16:47.310 --> 16:51.250
Oh, come on. What ship could be so
amazing that you wouldn't realize

16:51.280 --> 16:53.550
you were in the middle
of a space battle?

16:53.580 --> 16:55.220
That one right there.

17:00.650 --> 17:03.510
This is podracing!

17:11.599 --> 17:14.500
Out of my way.

17:14.530 --> 17:17.300
The N-1 Naboo starfighter!

17:17.369 --> 17:20.270
An Old Republic classic.
Pristine!

17:20.310 --> 17:22.280
Still has the chromium
undercarriage.

17:22.310 --> 17:25.250
- I must fly it.
- That's exactly what I said!

17:27.349 --> 17:30.150
Phew! I thought
we were goners.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.140
Wait. We still
need that ship.

17:32.180 --> 17:35.150
Hey! What are you
doing here? Whoa!

17:36.260 --> 17:38.590
The Rebels are escaping
in an N-1 starfighter.

17:38.620 --> 17:41.190
<i>Stop that ship!</i>

17:54.440 --> 17:57.350
Quiet! Your whining
will not go unpunished.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.380
Yippee!

18:04.320 --> 18:07.320
TIE fighters?
What TIE fighters?

18:10.360 --> 18:13.160
Ah. I see them now.

18:19.370 --> 18:22.200
You shall pay
for your insubordination.

18:28.270 --> 18:29.270
Bye-bye.

18:34.580 --> 18:38.620
Zander? Do you have any idea what
it's gonna cost to fix this?

18:38.650 --> 18:41.510
Yeah, a whole lot of money.
I mean...

18:41.550 --> 18:43.550
I'm sorry?

18:43.590 --> 18:46.630
Activate the tractor beam!

18:46.660 --> 18:49.560
<i>- Also, today's lunch
is tauntaun loaf.</i>

18:49.600 --> 18:51.500
<i>That is all.</i>

18:53.600 --> 18:55.470
What? No!

19:00.310 --> 19:02.280
Can we please get out of here?

19:02.310 --> 19:04.310
Not until we get that ship.

19:04.340 --> 19:07.170
Okay, okay. That's not so bad.
I can buff that out.

19:08.250 --> 19:10.250
Ew.
I can hammer that out.

19:12.380 --> 19:15.210
That... That might require
a brand-new ship.

19:15.250 --> 19:18.280
You are <i>so</i> dead.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.250
We got those Rebels.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.190
Face the music, Rebel cur!

19:27.170 --> 19:29.570
Uh, Lord Vader.
We can explain.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.160
What had happened was...

19:33.610 --> 19:35.540
Ow!

19:37.210 --> 19:39.150
Now can we get out of here?

19:43.180 --> 19:48.380
- The Rebels are escaping. -Oh, no.
We're not falling for that again.

19:51.590 --> 19:55.360
I got this scrape during
the Battle of Christophsis

19:55.390 --> 19:57.490
and this dent
from the skirmish on Naboo.

19:57.530 --> 20:01.470
This scratch I got from falling over
some junk back there in the hangar.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.470
For the love of the Maker,
do you ever shut up?

20:04.500 --> 20:08.270
- All you had to do was ask me.
- I did...

20:08.310 --> 20:10.340
26 chapters ago.

20:10.380 --> 20:16.220
I was right in the middle of a good story.
I want my ship right now!

20:21.320 --> 20:23.320
My baby!

20:23.360 --> 20:27.360
- Look what you've done! I should
have you arrested. -Get in line.

20:27.390 --> 20:31.220
I'm sorry, Mr. Cooper, but when I
took it for a routine test drive...

20:31.260 --> 20:33.620
Blah, blah, blah. It was stolen
by an Imperial Sith Lord.

20:33.670 --> 20:36.300
Just ask your astromech.

20:36.340 --> 20:38.310
You irresponsible imbeciles!

20:38.340 --> 20:42.540
You will be harvesting Klatooine paddy frogs
for the Hutts when I'm through with you!

20:42.570 --> 20:47.240
Mr. Cooper, I'm sure there's nothing
wrong with the ship that we can't fix.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.550
Just take any ship you see here.

20:53.590 --> 20:55.220
Oh, right.

20:55.250 --> 20:59.580
I'm gonna be seen flying
around in that, or that!

20:59.630 --> 21:01.560
I don't even know what that is.

21:01.590 --> 21:06.190
Hold the holophone!
What is this?

21:06.230 --> 21:08.630
I've never seen one of these!

21:08.670 --> 21:14.610
The sleek lines... Is that the
SFS-204 sublight ion engine?

21:14.640 --> 21:17.610
That powered the first ship my
parents bought me when I was eight!

21:17.640 --> 21:19.640
But that's...
that's my Blazemaker!

21:19.680 --> 21:22.220
My life's work!
My pride and joy!

21:22.250 --> 21:24.550
So much the sweeter.

21:24.580 --> 21:27.610
Or would you rather
I report you to the Empire?

21:27.650 --> 21:29.180
Better let him have it.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.580
Remember, it's not
business, it's personal.

21:31.620 --> 21:35.450
Pleasure doing business.
All sales are final.

21:38.660 --> 21:40.620
Aw, that's not right.

21:40.670 --> 21:44.540
All that work, and you let that guy
just fly out of here with my...

21:44.570 --> 21:49.210
Oh, that's right. I never
fixed the fusion tubes.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.240
I'll have to remember that when
I build the Blazemaker Mark II!

21:53.710 --> 21:56.540
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer!
