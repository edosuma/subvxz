WEBVTT

00:01.167 --> 00:03.461
Phil asked me if anything happened

00:04.421 --> 00:05.672
to deliver this to you.

00:05.755 --> 00:08.049
He wanted you to be executor.

00:08.133 --> 00:10.552
NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:10.635 --> 00:15.306
Among Sergeant Esterhaus' effects
was this letter addressed to

00:15.390 --> 00:17.767
the peace officers
of the Hill Street day shift.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.227
He said he was gonna kill me.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.604
He made me get undressed
and lie on the floor.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.982
Joe, why can't you just hold me?

00:24.065 --> 00:26.234
Make sex okay for me again.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.529
Video camera. We found it behind
a two-way mirror in the bedroom.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.866
What? I'm not a blackmailer, Lieutenant.

00:32.949 --> 00:36.036
This girl is on tape
with dozens of serious people, Frank.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.371
I wouldn't sell her
any life insurance, would you?

00:38.455 --> 00:41.833
What do you know about the legalities
of spreading ashes on public property?

00:42.584 --> 00:44.419
-Ashes?
-Phil's remains.

00:44.502 --> 00:47.213
Whitney Barnes.
One shot in the side of the head.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.632
-Very professional.
-Anything at all from SID?

00:50.300 --> 00:51.342
No sign of a struggle.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.762
Esterhaus was the law up here.

00:53.845 --> 00:58.224
And now that he's dead
I feel like everything's gonna unravel.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.977
It's your job and mine
to see that it doesn't.

01:05.231 --> 01:07.442
(indistinct chatter)

01:16.659 --> 01:17.494
HENRY: Okay.

01:23.374 --> 01:26.127
Okay, save it. Let's come to order.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.214
Come on, guys.
It's even money, we can start on time.

01:29.798 --> 01:33.176
All right, I'm happy to announce
there has been a thaw

01:33.259 --> 01:35.553
in the department's freeze on promotions.

01:35.637 --> 01:36.930
Lucy Bates is now a sergeant.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.723
(cheering)

01:43.645 --> 01:45.522
Lucy will be commander of the watch.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.984
She'll be making assignments,
turning out the shift.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.404
You won't have Goldblume
to kick around anymore.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.323
Sergeant Bates.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.581
Okay, memorial ser--

02:03.915 --> 02:06.751
service for Sergeant Esterhaus
in the Benedict Chapel

02:06.835 --> 02:08.878
of the police academy
at 11:00 this morning.

02:09.587 --> 02:12.006
Assignments, Coffey,
you're gonna be with Peyser.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.509
Kolziki is out sick,
so Perez is gonna be with Pilsky.

02:14.592 --> 02:15.802
You'll ride together, okay?

02:16.094 --> 02:19.931
Also, I'm announcing a new khaki officer
that'll be under Leo's wing.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.683
Her name is Natalie DeRoy.

02:21.933 --> 02:24.394
Natalie spent the last two years
up at Division, so...

02:24.477 --> 02:25.520
Slow it down.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.689
I can't understand
one single thing she's saying.

02:27.772 --> 02:30.900
If you find her-- I mean, find her,

02:30.984 --> 02:32.360
then welcome her to the Hill, okay?

02:32.986 --> 02:36.573
Item one, what you saw upstairs
and everywhere else,

02:36.656 --> 02:38.241
and that is perps.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.494
Okay, they've been stashed here
and in every other precinct holding cell.

02:41.911 --> 02:45.832
They're gonna be here till 3:00 p.m. today
by order of this Judge Cruz.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.376
He's the guy who declared
the Michigan Avenue

02:48.459 --> 02:51.546
unconstitutionally overcrowded
and inhumane.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.673
The judge had them in juvie hall annex,

02:53.756 --> 02:56.009
but that was until last night
and you know that some of them

02:56.092 --> 02:58.386
croaked the two Diablo Rodriguez brothers.

02:58.469 --> 02:59.637
I'm heartbroken.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.683
LUCY: Judge Cruz says that if the city
doesn't come up with a plan

03:03.766 --> 03:07.520
by 3:00 p.m. today
for more humane incarceration

03:07.604 --> 03:09.522
that he's gonna let them all loose.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.734
-Humane Society.
-(barking)

03:14.736 --> 03:18.990
So everywhere in the station
is gonna be a zoo, all right?

03:19.073 --> 03:20.742
Let's keep all visits down to a minimum.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.619
That's it. Now, wants and warrants.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.413
Here we go.
We got a warrant on Lester Menley.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.373
That's the pimp for Whitney Barnes.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.043
That's the call girl that was in here
last night and got whacked.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.003
We got one on the zucchini robber.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.047
(laughing)

03:34.130 --> 03:37.342
LUCY: And we got one
on the false zucchini robber, okay?

03:37.425 --> 03:39.552
By the way, the false zucchini robber
last night

03:39.636 --> 03:42.472
took our own Lieutenant Goldblume
and his companion.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.766
So I want you to check the board upstairs.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.768
Everybody.
There's descriptions on the board, okay?

03:46.851 --> 03:49.437
Thank you. Just want to say I'm sorry.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.523
I-- I'm gonna get a lot better at this.
I was a little nervous.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.236
And I want to say I think it stinks
that somebody stole the podium.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.573
-MAN: Earn it!
-Who said that?

04:03.117 --> 04:06.162
Whoever said that,
I don't have to earn the damn podium.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.957
I have to earn that you love me
like you did the sarge.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.417
But I don't have to earn your respect
for my position.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.004
So whoever the jerk is
better bring the podium back.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.132
(laughing)

04:20.009 --> 04:21.010
Was it you, LaRue?

04:23.513 --> 04:25.098
Hey, easy, Sergeant.

04:26.975 --> 04:27.809
Huh?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.812
Come on, you think you're so tough.
Come on, you want to go outside?

04:35.692 --> 04:37.360
RENKO: Hey, you know...

04:37.944 --> 04:42.573
Okay, I was gonna say let's roll
and let's be careful.

04:44.367 --> 04:47.036
But whoever stole the podium,
I hope you get hit by a truck.

04:50.498 --> 04:53.001
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

04:53.418 --> 04:55.128
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:55.211 --> 04:59.007
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:59.090 --> 05:00.675
(sirens wailing)

05:06.139 --> 05:10.059
(theme music playing)

06:31.516 --> 06:33.393
(siren wailing)

06:45.071 --> 06:46.322
LUCY: Sergeant Bates here.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.157
Yeah.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.829
Officer Schnitz. Natalie DeRoy reporting.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.831
-How do you do?
-How can I help you?

06:55.498 --> 06:56.541
Take me to Miami?

06:57.917 --> 06:59.877
I had a whole tour planned for you, but--

06:59.961 --> 07:01.337
I don't think now's the time.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.215
Why don't you help me
sign in our new guests?

07:04.465 --> 07:06.342
-You got it.
-Call me Leo.

07:08.719 --> 07:09.887
-Come on!
-Coffey.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.558
Washington and LaRue just called in
a homicide at Hotel Pershing.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.685
-You and Peyser take backup perimeter.
-Got it.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.937
Hey, I told you in complete confidence.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.189
-I asked you not to tell anybody else.
-I didn't.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.233
You didn't? Baloney.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.902
Everybody knew about my promotion
before Goldblume even opened his mouth.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.612
-It wasn't me, Lucy.
-No?

07:27.405 --> 07:28.239
No.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.451
Did you just take the podium
or did you stand around laughing?

07:31.534 --> 07:35.288
Look, I'm gonna tell you one more time,
I don't know anything about any of that.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.081
Except you're acting like a jerk.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.500
Right. You got your assignment.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.002
Yeah.

07:41.878 --> 07:42.712
Archie.

07:43.671 --> 07:44.797
-Bobby.
-BOBBY: Yo!

07:47.675 --> 07:51.512
Got a felonious assault, 1374 Curtis, 4B.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.223
(reporters clamoring)

08:00.771 --> 08:01.647
Thanks, gentlemen.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.816
-Are you official yet?
-Yes.

08:04.609 --> 08:05.860
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.236
-Morning, Henry.
-Morning.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.864
-How'd she do?
-Not great.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.699
Someone put the arm on the podium.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.118
-How do you want to handle it?
-I don't.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.079
Howard, Ray.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.916
Do you believe this Judge Cruz?

08:19.999 --> 08:22.210
I think what he's really onto is getting
Michigan Avenue under control.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.587
Meanwhile he inundates the precincts.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.298
Frank, after Phil's service,

08:27.381 --> 08:29.926
I'd like a shot at running down
this Lester Menley.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.011
We'll see how the day develops, Henry.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.804
-Good morning, Frank.
-Morning, Ray.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.765
HOWARD: You got your tired and your poor,
huh, Frank.

08:35.848 --> 08:38.684
Not to mention the wretched refuse.
What's in the can?

08:39.101 --> 08:40.102
Phil Esterhaus.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.064
-Would you get the door, Ray?
-Sure.

08:45.566 --> 08:49.111
(clears throat) Phil requested
that after the memorial services

08:49.195 --> 08:52.323
his ashes be scattered
over the epicenter of the Hill.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.909
An inhabited area. Is that legal?

08:55.201 --> 08:56.494
It was his last request, Ray.

08:56.744 --> 08:57.787
Good for you, Frank.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.540
Now someone has to find
the epicenter of the Hill.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.624
Oh, that should be very easy.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.918
Once you make
your cartographic assumptions.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.753
I'll use the precinct map, Howard.

09:06.587 --> 09:07.421
FRANK: Um...

09:08.548 --> 09:10.466
I think our best bet
is to do this at night.

09:11.175 --> 09:14.011
Phil asked that anybody from the day shift
who's interested, uh,

09:14.428 --> 09:16.806
be present,
but this can't be official, Ray.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.766
You're gonna have to
notify everybody individually.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.601
All right. What time should I say?

09:21.060 --> 09:22.603
(sighs) 10:00? 11:00?

09:22.687 --> 09:25.106
Is all the commentated man
no more than this?

09:25.731 --> 09:28.276
(shouting)

09:29.193 --> 09:31.362
-Hey, break it up!
-Wait.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.531
Give her a chance.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.659
(siren wailing)

09:45.626 --> 09:47.503
You're telling me you don't know her, huh?

09:47.753 --> 09:50.089
Hey, Doc, how you doing?
Welcome to paradise.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.142
That smell's not from the body either.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.567
Someone really worked out on her.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.446
Got a description for you, J.D.

10:13.529 --> 10:14.822
Says it's one guy.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.452
Coming through.

10:19.535 --> 10:20.870
NATE: If you hear of anything,
let me know.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.331
Coming through. See you, guys.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.082
J.D.: Yeah, all right, Doc. Go ahead.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.627
All right, go ahead now.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.170
He forced his way in, um...

10:30.046 --> 10:33.174
We had the rope, you know,
around the door, but there was no lock.

10:33.257 --> 10:36.010
Look, son, if you can complete
the description, we got to put it out.

10:36.427 --> 10:39.889
Yeah, he was white, average height, um,

10:40.097 --> 10:43.142
pretty thin and he had short brown hair.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.020
-And he had blue eyes.
-Good.

10:46.103 --> 10:47.146
How long ago?

10:48.189 --> 10:49.523
(sighs) Um...

10:51.317 --> 10:54.070
about 30 minutes since he ran,
about an hour since he came in.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.573
I ran to call you guys--

10:57.657 --> 11:00.660
Look, we got to get this real fast
so we can put the description out.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.496
Now can you remember his clothes?
What he was wearing? Anything?

11:03.579 --> 11:05.956
Yeah, he had, like, black pants

11:06.040 --> 11:09.251
and he had on a, you know,
a dungaree jacket.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.381
And, uh, her bracelet was taken.

11:13.464 --> 11:14.840
Oh, that's a shocker.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.258
Yeah, it was like a...

11:17.635 --> 11:20.429
an ID bracelet.
It had Cathy written on it.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.223
I'll get this on the radio.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.809
Did real good, son. Got a good memory.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.771
-I'm gonna be an artist.
-Yeah, she was gonna be a dancer.

11:32.566 --> 11:33.943
Men in blue.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.153
What's the problem? Where's the assault?

11:36.237 --> 11:38.239
-Is your name Reggie--
-Regis.

11:38.322 --> 11:40.574
Regis Rossmore. Unemployed nurse.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.744
With an impossible situation on his hands.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.080
Chop, chop, officers.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.379
All right, Miss Difficult.
Help has arrived.

11:53.462 --> 11:56.090
Well, I'm sorry, but I've been stuck
in here for over an hour.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.718
This is with reference
to my explicit instructions

11:58.801 --> 12:01.178
Lois was not to sit down in the tub.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.013
She has an undisplaced pelvic fracture.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.599
Why'd you put her in there if she's not
supposed to take a bath?

12:05.683 --> 12:08.018
-She was to stay on all fours.
-I'm mortified.

12:08.102 --> 12:10.062
REGIS: To avoid exactly this situation.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.273
-Plus, she's pruning up.
-Regis, will you go

12:12.356 --> 12:14.817
and take the coffee cake
out of the freezer and heat it up for me?

12:14.900 --> 12:17.111
Coffee, yes. Cake, no.

12:17.194 --> 12:20.030
-Why didn't you call the paramedics?
-So chastise me later.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.408
(groans) Watch it!

12:22.825 --> 12:25.161
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I got lost in the terrain.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.747
-(laughs)
-I tried to call the paramedics.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.457
They said we weren't an emergency.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.042
I shudder to think
if I weren't Lois' neighbor.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.794
So you phoned in an assault?

12:34.420 --> 12:36.422
-I was at my wit's end.
-Well, we are here, Robert.

12:36.505 --> 12:38.132
Let's go. On three.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.050
All right, all right.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.095
Ready, ma'am? One, two...

12:43.179 --> 12:44.305
Help them, Lois.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.432
(grunting)

12:46.515 --> 12:48.434
-Whoa!
-What? What?

12:48.517 --> 12:50.478
What is it? What is it?

12:50.561 --> 12:52.104
-Merciful mother.
-What?

12:52.188 --> 12:54.565
I have done it. I have done it.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.443
I have strained my milk.

12:57.526 --> 13:00.613
-I have herniated myself.
-You poor lamb.

13:01.322 --> 13:04.200
RADIO: <i>Officer requesting backups</i>
<i>on a 616.</i>

13:04.283 --> 13:06.368
-Hear that, Renko?
-Hear that? I hear my maker.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.537
-You gonna be okay, folks?
-I'm so grateful.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.998
-Thousand thanks.
-Okay.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.625
Okay, we got to make another call.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.503
You know what I do to people like you?

13:15.920 --> 13:18.464
-Ooh.
-BOBBY: Come on, let's go.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.175
Is my pain a source
of amusement to you, Robert?

13:21.258 --> 13:23.052
-No, Andy.
-Why don't we go down to the morgue

13:23.135 --> 13:24.512
and really get a belly laugh?

13:24.595 --> 13:26.305
Easy step. Here we go.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.432
All right.

13:29.892 --> 13:30.810
Bye, there.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.479
(siren blaring)

13:45.366 --> 13:47.451
Junkie, fits the Hotel Pershing
killer description.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.078
-We'll take this side.
-Right.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.299
Spread 'em! Spread 'em!

14:05.469 --> 14:07.429
-What's this? Cathy?
-That's mine!

14:07.513 --> 14:09.056
-Cathy?
-That's mine!

14:10.140 --> 14:12.476
-Coff!
-What's wrong with you?

14:12.768 --> 14:14.645
You raped a 14-year-old girl?

14:14.728 --> 14:17.147
-You kill her? You kill her?
-Stop!

14:17.231 --> 14:18.190
(indistinct yelling)

14:21.443 --> 14:22.570
You're busted, man.

14:27.032 --> 14:30.160
MAN:
In watching Phil teach our recruits,

14:31.161 --> 14:32.955
I experienced his compassion

14:33.914 --> 14:36.584
his quiet strength, his joy of life

14:37.126 --> 14:39.086
and his deep sense of responsibility.

14:40.504 --> 14:43.340
Let me read you a poem
which conveys these qualities in him.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.552
"I am at ease.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.596
It's end of day.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.890
My duty has been done.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.769
The hour calls me far away
beyond the setting sun.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.148
Meet me by the ocean's rocks,

14:59.982 --> 15:01.567
in the shadows on the lane.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.863
Find me in the snowflakes
as they crowd against the pane.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.991
Or beckon me in silence.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.744
Then listen to the breeze

15:12.912 --> 15:14.955
and you will hear me always.

15:15.664 --> 15:18.918
For at last I stand at ease."

15:22.046 --> 15:24.256
Phil's wish that he be cremated
was carried out...

15:24.340 --> 15:26.008
(clears throat) earlier this morning.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.928
There will be no graveside service.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.347
God bless you and thank you for coming.

15:43.150 --> 15:44.693
That was very moving, sir.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.820
The rock and the silence and all.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.657
Was that Simon and Garfunkel?

15:50.157 --> 15:51.492
No, that was Phil Esterhaus.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.160
He wrote a lot of poetry.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.624
-Chief.
-Nice service, huh, Frank?

15:58.707 --> 16:00.501
Brief and to the point.
A lot like the man.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.379
Irwin says you told him not to present
a plan for Michigan Avenue.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.215
-Yes, sir.
-Well, is corrections presenting?

16:06.840 --> 16:08.884
Well, technically it's not their problem.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.886
-Chief.
-Leave it to me, Frank.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.056
You're gonna have your holding cells back
by the end of the day.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.558
It's not gonna help matters
if Cruz empties the holding cells

16:16.642 --> 16:18.060
and puts the criminals back on my streets.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.144
Of course not.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.647
Well-- Then are you presenting a plan?

16:22.481 --> 16:23.816
We're gonna get results.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.985
Sympathies to Phil's family.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.695
Did he have family?

16:29.363 --> 16:31.281
-(engine starts)
-(car door closes)

16:35.953 --> 16:38.706
The tumblers on B lock are off

16:38.789 --> 16:43.002
so you have to sort of develop
a feel for it with your wrists.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.754
Uh-huh. You sure there's room in there?

16:45.838 --> 16:48.590
-He'll squeeze in.
-I'm a sociable person.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.551
Keep your clothes on, okay?

16:51.802 --> 16:52.970
-What's that?
-How you doing?

16:53.053 --> 16:55.055
LEO: That? Nothing.

16:55.597 --> 16:56.974
NATALIE:
Leo, that's the roll call podium.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.601
They sometimes play pranks on each other.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.770
Some of them are funnier than others.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.313
You're not gonna say anything?

17:03.647 --> 17:04.690
None of our business.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.985
Fellow Americans!

17:09.069 --> 17:10.821
I want to address you...

17:11.739 --> 17:14.575
on the subject of rights.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.871
We got human rights.

17:19.413 --> 17:22.499
We got inalienable rights.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.626
(laughs)

17:25.627 --> 17:29.798
We got the right to bear arms.

17:30.924 --> 17:36.221
And I got a right
to bear my bold black ass.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.182
(cheering)

17:40.768 --> 17:42.186
You're beautiful.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.063
I love you, baby.

17:52.696 --> 17:55.324
-Sandy, hi.
-Hi.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.450
What are you doing here?

17:57.242 --> 17:59.328
Got a message
I'm supposed to pick up my purse.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.372
That was probably court property.
They used it as evidence in the hearing.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.583
I think Leo can get that for you.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.503
-How you doing?
-Not great.

18:08.712 --> 18:09.588
It takes time.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.466
Hey, hold it right there, chump face.

18:15.969 --> 18:19.014
Okay, buddy.
Leo, will you help Ms. Valpariso, please?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.099
-LEO: Sure.
-Thank you.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.268
LUCY: Natalie, get some bracelets
for this guy, will you?

18:26.105 --> 18:26.939
Hi.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.108
Hi.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.026
Were you looking for me?

18:31.985 --> 18:33.737
No, just picking up my purse.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.827
Look, Sandy,
maybe we should talk about last night.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.204
No, Joe.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.289
At this point,
I think it's smarter if I do that

18:44.373 --> 18:46.625
with somebody
who understands my situation.

18:49.586 --> 18:50.420
Thank you.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.263
Frank.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.015
-Ms. Davenport.
-Lieutenant.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.642
How was the ceremony?

19:04.393 --> 19:07.437
I'm grateful to you and Ray
for holding the fort for me here, Howard.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.940
Well, I'll say my goodbyes tonight.
(sighs)

19:10.941 --> 19:13.360
I imagine London was something like this
during the blitz.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.821
-Captain. Ms. Davenport.
-Leo.

19:15.904 --> 19:17.573
-You have Harold Baker?
-Waiting for you in lineup.

19:17.656 --> 19:18.949
Okay, thanks. See you later.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.994
That's Lester Menley,
Whitney Barnes' panderer.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.872
-Who made the bust?
-Turned himself in.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.832
Interrogation will be ready
in a couple minutes.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.542
-I'd like to sit in, Frank.
-Call me.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.173
Mr. Menley. Lieutenant Goldblume.

19:34.923 --> 19:37.384
Lieutenant, I didn't kill Whitney Barnes.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.635
Let's hit that right away.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.846
You want to talk to me? Let's talk.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.764
We want to talk, all right. Come on.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.769
LESTER: You want to know about Whitney?

19:50.147 --> 19:52.399
In the last two years,
I didn't get her five dates.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.485
God, she was sweet.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.989
But she wasn't stupid.
She knew what had happened.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.283
She knew she was working
a different kind of trick.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.661
Which those cats
referred between themselves.

20:05.078 --> 20:05.996
You understand?

20:08.332 --> 20:09.750
She never once brought it up.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.960
We never once had the conversation.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.340
Maybe we should have made
different arrangements.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.218
Well, that's the kind
of class woman she was.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.804
What do you know about the murder, Lester?

20:24.264 --> 20:25.098
In a minute.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.853
I didn't get to say
what a sad thing this is.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.189
You lived off her.
You filmed what she did for blackmail.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.191
-Cut the crap.
-Blackmail who?

20:35.067 --> 20:36.485
I didn't blackmail anybody.

20:37.152 --> 20:38.237
What'd you make the movies for?

20:38.320 --> 20:40.656
Because I knew
something exactly like this could happen.

20:40.739 --> 20:41.615
I didn't kill Whiney.

20:41.698 --> 20:44.910
One of those fat slobs who didn't want
her memoires told killed her.

20:45.702 --> 20:48.747
And now in the papers Lester Menley this
and Lester Menley that.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.666
And now they're coming after me.

20:50.749 --> 20:54.002
Well, when we're done here,

20:54.753 --> 20:56.838
Mr. Townsend and I
are telling the right story.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.384
The people have got to know
the Lester Menley plan for the future.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.470
-What people?
-The papers.

21:03.887 --> 21:05.806
The Lester Menley plan for the future.

21:05.889 --> 21:08.642
Which is to live in Nassau
and don't bother anybody.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.394
Unless somebody tries to kill me.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.814
And then my attorney sells the tapes
to the highest bidder.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.316
Got a slight problem there, Lester.

21:16.858 --> 21:18.151
What, you think you got them all?

21:19.236 --> 21:20.862
You don't think I made copies?

21:22.072 --> 21:23.991
You think you're going to Nassau?

21:25.075 --> 21:27.077
He's material to a murder investigation.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.331
We'll stay domestic, Captain.
You'll be apprised of our whereabouts.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.417
He goes nowhere. He stays in custody.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.713
Wait a minute.
My message has got to get out.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.673
The people on those tapes
have got to know where I'm at.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.883
I don't mean trouble for anybody.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.895
HAROLD: I'm a junkie. If I ain't holding
I can be a bad character.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.064
I know that. I got a sheet.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.609
But I was holding.
I don't do violence when I'm holding.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.820
-You had her bracelet.
-I found it.

22:01.903 --> 22:04.156
I told them it was on the window,
and I picked it up.

22:04.948 --> 22:07.534
Why did you assault the officer
when he tried to take it away from you?

22:07.617 --> 22:09.703
I was defending myself. He come at me.

22:11.621 --> 22:15.167
Harold, if you're saying he started it,
there are witnesses who say otherwise.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.421
Lady, you got to understand what I am.

22:19.921 --> 22:23.175
If I see something laying in the street,
something that might give me a lift,

22:23.258 --> 22:24.801
I pick it up, it's mine.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.013
Somebody tries to take it from me,
I fight 'em.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.724
I got to keep it going, that's all.
You see?

22:31.725 --> 22:33.226
That's all I can think about.

22:34.436 --> 22:35.937
How could I rape somebody?

22:37.314 --> 22:39.566
I ain't even thought about
a woman in years.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.401
(crying)

22:50.369 --> 22:52.037
-Hi.
-Hi.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.248
That Hotel Pershing suspect

22:55.332 --> 22:57.793
-was pretty badly beaten, Frank.
-Oh?

22:57.876 --> 22:59.878
Apart from the fact
I think he's probably innocent.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.214
Court's not till this afternoon,
Counselor.

23:02.297 --> 23:05.175
I fully intend to explore
my client's legal remedies.

23:05.258 --> 23:08.136
I was suggesting that girl's attacker
may still be on the street.

23:09.596 --> 23:12.808
God, would they be able to get Judge Cruz
a plan by 3:00?

23:12.891 --> 23:15.602
Well, Daniels is all sly winks
and vague promises.

23:15.685 --> 23:18.313
And he's told Bernstein
not to submit a plan.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.315
Maybe Daniels has something going
with the governor.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.775
And maybe it's a fast shuffle.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.111
Frank, I realize the strain
you've all been under.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.655
You want to hear about Joe Coffey's
last three weeks,

23:26.738 --> 23:27.739
starting with when he was shot?

23:27.823 --> 23:31.743
Rule of law is most important
when things are most unraveled, Pizza Man.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.454
(chuckles) Just what you needed.

23:39.751 --> 23:43.046
What I need is you in a hotel room.

23:43.713 --> 23:44.548
Tonight.

23:47.384 --> 23:48.677
I'll make a reservation.

24:03.483 --> 24:06.153
Hey, Leo. A witness
from the Hotel Pershing homicide.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.613
I saw him kill Cathy.

24:08.697 --> 24:09.823
Lineup's in 20 minutes.

24:09.906 --> 24:12.200
All right.
Hey, you make yourself comfortable, okay?

24:27.174 --> 24:28.508
Hey, this way.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.386
What the hell you doing? They just told me
that I could go. Now you're arresting me--

24:31.470 --> 24:33.221
What is it with you guys anyway, huh?

24:34.431 --> 24:35.599
-Lester?
-Yeah.

24:35.682 --> 24:39.603
-(gunshots)
-(people screaming)

24:39.686 --> 24:41.688
-Get the gun.
-Where's the damn key?

24:45.150 --> 24:48.612
Seal the building. Nobody gets out of here
until we have statements!

24:51.448 --> 24:53.575
(siren wailing)

24:55.869 --> 24:57.245
Frank, Frank.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.663
Witness has him in a cream-colored sedan

24:58.747 --> 25:00.582
-heading west on Dekker.
-Ray. Ray.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.375
APB. Any plates?

25:02.459 --> 25:03.668
-Only partial.
-What was it?

25:03.752 --> 25:06.004
Uh, alpha, niner, seven
are first three digits.

25:06.087 --> 25:08.048
All right, descriptions
to the FBI and state patrol.

25:08.131 --> 25:09.799
Deploy at the airport,
bus and train stations.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.385
-Gurney coming through!
-Come on, move it. Move it!

25:12.469 --> 25:13.720
Give us some room.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.180
Come on, I'll give it to you.

25:16.723 --> 25:19.184
-Nine people make it a cop.
-No badge number, no insignia.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.477
It was a professional hit, Captain.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.687
The guy goes into a party store,
he cops a uniform.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.357
-Get statements, J.D.
-LUCY: Clear in here, please!

25:25.440 --> 25:27.234
FAY (gasps): Oh, my God!

25:28.902 --> 25:29.736
Sorry.

25:30.987 --> 25:32.822
Henry, I went all the way back
to the Heights to file

25:32.906 --> 25:34.908
the robbery complaint,
but they said you never came in.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.701
I told them I'd do the paperwork here.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.828
Couldn't you have told me that
at the memorial service?

25:38.912 --> 25:41.790
-Lineup's ready, Lieutenant.
-I'm very sorry, Fay.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.292
It just completely slipped my mind.
We're a little bit jammed up here.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.420
Henry, I know it's a madhouse,
but all I need is two minutes.

25:47.504 --> 25:49.881
-I think we ought to talk.
-I'll call you later, okay?

25:53.260 --> 25:54.177
I don't see him.

25:57.472 --> 25:59.140
Number three, step forward please.

26:02.644 --> 26:05.063
-No, that's not him.
-Take your time.

26:05.939 --> 26:08.149
(sighs) I know that ain't him.

26:10.819 --> 26:11.861
Number four, step forward.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.076
No, he didn't look anything like that.

26:22.330 --> 26:25.000
It's not him.
The guy's not up there. I'm positive.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.589
-You'll release?
-No, we're charging.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.382
Narcotics possession and assault.

26:33.091 --> 26:35.885
We'll cross complain.
False arrest and brutality.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.224
No ID on that Hotel Pershing
murder suspect. Wrong guy.

26:41.308 --> 26:42.851
Then let's get people back to that area.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.353
Ray, we found a stolen sedan
at 116th and Fredrick

26:45.437 --> 26:47.397
with a police uniform
stuffed under the seat.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.566
-Our hitman.
-Must have switched cars.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.901
Any description?
Any witness at the switch?

26:51.985 --> 26:52.861
We're canvassing.

26:54.112 --> 26:58.366
Sergeant, the Menley shooter
abandoned a car at 116 and Frederick.

26:58.617 --> 26:59.618
Okay, I'll put it up.

26:59.868 --> 27:03.496
And put any available uniforms
back on the Hotel Pershing perimeter.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.750
We don't have anybody left, Lieutenant.
I'll have to call the Heights.

27:10.587 --> 27:13.423
(whistles)
I picked up the call on my car radio.

27:14.382 --> 27:16.843
You got to give him
lots of virile plumbing, Frank.

27:17.177 --> 27:20.430
Go after the guy in a police station
in broad daylight.

27:20.513 --> 27:23.516
-Everything under control?
-Nothing's under control.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.935
I have to know what your plan is.

27:26.019 --> 27:27.812
What proposal you're gonna make
to Judge Cruz.

27:28.313 --> 27:31.191
Frank, I asked you
to trust me on this one.

27:31.274 --> 27:32.734
Or aren't you gonna make
any proposal at all?

27:32.817 --> 27:34.736
You gonna wonder in there around 3:00,
hem and haw

27:34.819 --> 27:37.280
about not having enough time
and let Judge Cruz open up all the cells?

27:37.364 --> 27:40.533
Frank, to put Michigan Avenue right,
that's a $5 million job.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.035
Bernstein's got a million and change.

27:42.118 --> 27:44.579
Now, I'm gonna get the money
to fix that place once and for all.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.581
How, by letting perpetrators
roam the streets

27:46.665 --> 27:49.751
so you can dramatize the fiscal shortfall
in blood? Do you want a riot?

27:49.834 --> 27:52.170
Frank, you have got to mobilize
the public's willingness

27:52.253 --> 27:54.923
to address a problem. Please, trust me.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.926
-Candy?
-Esterhaus.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.682
We're all oars in the same boat, Frank.

28:09.604 --> 28:10.730
Get me Irwin Bernstein.

28:12.941 --> 28:13.775
Joe.

28:16.486 --> 28:18.405
Is there someplace where we could talk?

28:20.281 --> 28:23.368
I thought you wanted to talk to somebody
who understands your problem.

28:24.160 --> 28:24.994
I have.

28:25.495 --> 28:27.205
It's what I want to talk to you about.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.475
I was just at the rape clinic.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.186
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.564
I'm gonna be going there for a while.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.108
That's good.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.447
The lady I've been seeing there
really knows her stuff.

29:01.406 --> 29:03.491
And she told me that sometimes

29:04.284 --> 29:05.952
what happened to you last night,

29:06.828 --> 29:08.580
some men react that way.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.584
Look, I feel like
enough of a jerk already.

29:12.667 --> 29:13.960
You don't have to tell the whole world.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.421
Joe, she's my therapist.

29:18.256 --> 29:19.090
(scoffs)

29:20.300 --> 29:22.093
Look, what I'm trying to say is

29:22.886 --> 29:23.720
if we're gonna...

29:26.431 --> 29:28.683
I feel that maybe I was--

29:29.642 --> 29:31.311
I feel maybe I wasn't being fair.

29:33.146 --> 29:35.106
And if we're gonna work this out
between us,

29:36.232 --> 29:37.817
we've got to work it out together.

29:40.153 --> 29:43.990
Sandy, I'm not sure how I felt last night
is gonna change that easily.

29:45.325 --> 29:49.996
Joe, I don't want to be with a man
who feels like I'm damaged goods either.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.832
But I think that can change.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.543
And I'm willing to chance it.

29:56.753 --> 29:57.587
Are you?

30:00.298 --> 30:01.132
Yeah.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.597
So, Joey, I thought maybe

30:07.680 --> 30:09.891
we could see each other
a little later tonight.

30:12.268 --> 30:13.353
(clicks tongue)

30:15.063 --> 30:15.897
What?

30:18.691 --> 30:20.860
What if I, you know, still can't?

30:22.779 --> 30:23.947
Don't you worry.

30:25.573 --> 30:27.408
It'll happen when it happens.

30:28.576 --> 30:29.744
And what if it doesn't?

30:31.412 --> 30:32.831
We'll worry about it then.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.167
Is that you talking or your therapist?

30:37.460 --> 30:38.795
That part's all me.

30:41.464 --> 30:42.924
I really care for you, Joe.

30:43.633 --> 30:44.884
I want us to try.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.558
If you don't want to try just tell me.
I'll go.

30:52.892 --> 30:53.977
No, no, don't.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.189
I mean, I want to.
I want to see you tonight.

31:03.236 --> 31:05.321
I think we got a shot, Joe.

31:06.614 --> 31:08.199
At least we've got that much.

31:23.381 --> 31:26.467
Slow down, pal. You don't want to miss
any of these potholes.

31:26.551 --> 31:27.719
I think you better call Daryl Ann,

31:27.802 --> 31:30.096
tell her it'd be a good night
to have a headache.

31:30.179 --> 31:31.556
Thanks a lot, Bob.

31:31.639 --> 31:34.350
I'm standing on death's door
with my finger on the bell

31:34.434 --> 31:36.519
and you're casting
aspersions on my manhood.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.938
Aw. What's that?

31:39.022 --> 31:40.523
Oh, come on,
there's a killer on the loose.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.317
You don't want to be writing
no traffic violations.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.318
Looks like a rental.

31:45.486 --> 31:48.281
Please. Please. Please, watch the brakes.

31:48.364 --> 31:50.491
-Please with the brakes.
-(tires screech)

31:51.326 --> 31:54.412
WOMAN: This is awful.
I've never had an accident before.

31:54.495 --> 31:56.539
Listen, I've got all the papers
that are necessary.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.041
-MAN: That's all right.
-Give you my name and address.

31:58.124 --> 32:00.585
-MAN: I don't need your address.
-Well, you sure?

32:00.668 --> 32:03.004
Can I have both your licenses
and registration, please?

32:03.254 --> 32:04.672
Officer, that won't be necessary.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.758
The woman and I can work it out
between ourselves.

32:06.841 --> 32:09.719
This is a rental car, sir.
The company requires a police report.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.179
-Also, let me have--
-All right.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.139
I'll get the papers
out of the glove compartment.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.391
-Officer, it's my fault.
-Current address, ma'am.

32:15.475 --> 32:16.309
-Yes, it is.
-(car starts)

32:16.392 --> 32:18.019
Hey, hey, buddy!

32:24.525 --> 32:27.528
(siren wailing)

32:27.612 --> 32:30.448
This is 20-2-02 in pursuit
of possible stolen vehicle.

32:30.531 --> 32:34.786
Beige in color.
Westbound on Polk and 115th Street.

32:34.869 --> 32:37.580
RADIO: <i>Unit 20-2-02, we copy.</i>

32:37.664 --> 32:40.041
<i>You are code three. Switch to 10-2.</i>

32:40.124 --> 32:41.668
RENKO:
Roger, switching to code three.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.520
Whoa, man, this is hurting me, pal.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.981
Whoo, golly!

33:04.816 --> 33:06.734
It's smarting, man! Right, right, right!

33:13.700 --> 33:15.451
He's going left. He's going left.

33:25.920 --> 33:26.754
He's got a gun!

33:34.095 --> 33:36.055
MAN: Northside of Dekker and 136.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.683
We have a suspect down.
Get an ambulance here immediately.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.868
We can't keep prisoners
more than a month in an armory.

33:56.951 --> 33:58.995
I don't care how many
Porta Potties we bring in.

33:59.078 --> 34:02.623
Judge, the armory is only step A
to give us a leg up on step B.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.417
Which is a Michigan Avenue renovation?

34:04.500 --> 34:06.711
-Correct.
-Which you don't yet have funding for.

34:06.794 --> 34:10.381
-We've got 1,100,000.
-For a $5 million job.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.884
Please, Judge,
we are making a good faith effort.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.427
And I am, too, Mr. Bernstein.

34:14.510 --> 34:16.554
Only I happen to take seriously
the proposition

34:16.637 --> 34:18.473
that people are innocent
until proven guilty.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.224
So when I tour a desperately overcrowded

34:20.308 --> 34:22.518
and understaffed Michigan Avenue
and I see hundreds of men--

34:22.602 --> 34:24.562
Who have been arrested for crimes.

34:24.645 --> 34:26.814
But who are not yet convicted
of anything, sir.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.150
Except maybe being too poor to make bail.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.110
When I see the physical brutality,

34:31.569 --> 34:34.489
the unsanitary and indecent conditions
brought about by this overcrowding.

34:34.572 --> 34:38.326
Captain, may I ask you what life was like
in your stationhouse this morning?

34:38.409 --> 34:40.078
-Intolerable.
-That's what the men

34:40.161 --> 34:42.955
in the Michigan Avenue complex
have been living like every day.

34:43.539 --> 34:48.252
Judge, would you rather incarcerate
the entire citizenry of my precinct?

34:48.336 --> 34:50.838
-No.
-Well, the people living on the Hill

34:50.922 --> 34:54.008
are every bit as trapped by poverty
as those men you're talking about.

34:54.092 --> 34:57.428
And to have them endangered
in the conduct of their normal lives,

34:57.512 --> 35:00.139
I mean, to turn my precinct
into one big, bloated jail

35:00.223 --> 35:02.767
in which the innocent are entrapped
along with the lawless--

35:02.850 --> 35:04.352
That clearly was not my intention,
Captain.

35:04.435 --> 35:07.396
But that's the result.
My homicides and rapes have doubled.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.524
This morning,
a 14-year-old girl was murdered

35:09.607 --> 35:13.569
in one of those street kid's flop houses
that was literally inundated by parolees.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.488
I mean, not to mention,
the hitman who was able

35:15.571 --> 35:17.657
to commit a murder
right inside our own stationhouse.

35:17.740 --> 35:19.992
I love this. I love this criticism.

35:20.493 --> 35:23.246
Cruz finds inhumane conditions
so Cruz is a big softy.

35:23.329 --> 35:24.539
The minority softy.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.457
Don't just blame the release on Cruz.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.794
Blame the overcrowding, too.
Blame some hitman on Cruz.

35:29.877 --> 35:32.797
'Cause Cruz happens to remember
the US Constitutional prohibition

35:32.880 --> 35:34.632
against cruel and unusual punishments.

35:34.715 --> 35:36.801
Judge, I'm not questioning your record.

35:36.884 --> 35:39.428
And I understand
your need to protect the prisons.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.889
But please know
that your victory on Michigan Avenue

35:41.973 --> 35:43.266
is my defeat on the Hill.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.275
Chief, in the coming days,

35:52.358 --> 35:56.070
can I expect your good faith support
in advocacy for Michigan Avenue funding?

35:56.154 --> 35:57.280
Of course, Judge.

35:57.363 --> 35:59.907
If I stay my order to release

35:59.991 --> 36:03.202
there will be no subsiding in your effort
to raise this remaining 3.9?

36:03.661 --> 36:04.495
None whatever.

36:05.705 --> 36:08.332
Well, I'm certainly not opposed
to compromise.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.043
Shall we go through
section B again, gentlemen,

36:11.127 --> 36:13.963
on the assumption,
say, a two-week grace period

36:14.046 --> 36:15.798
with the Jetson Armory pressed into use?

36:20.887 --> 36:22.221
Congratulations, men.

36:23.389 --> 36:25.474
Pulled a little fast one on me,
did you, Frank?

36:25.808 --> 36:29.228
-All oars in the same boat, Chief.
-All pulling in the same direction.

36:29.312 --> 36:32.440
Speaking of which,
let me lighten your load some.

36:32.523 --> 36:34.275
Take that Menley thing off your hands.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.820
Admittedly, I have a special interest
in the case.

36:38.446 --> 36:41.032
It's also a practical fact
that you can't put the horses

36:41.115 --> 36:43.492
that Division can
on this sort of investigation.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.369
-True.
-I'll have property

36:45.453 --> 36:46.996
transfer those tapes downtown.

36:47.288 --> 36:51.250
Yeah, well, there's probably no truth
to those threats he made anyway.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.794
-Who?
-(clears throat) Menley.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.214
He probably doesn't really have
copies of those tapes.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.131
Copies?

36:58.090 --> 36:59.508
Probably just blowing smoke.

37:10.519 --> 37:12.480
-Hill and Renko were in a shootout.
-Are they all right?

37:12.563 --> 37:14.565
Guy's dead.
They've ID'd him as the Menley shooter.

37:14.649 --> 37:15.858
Pro out of Rochester.

37:15.942 --> 37:17.693
I'm crosschecking Whitney's lists,

37:17.777 --> 37:20.071
see if maybe she had a john
from upstate New York.

37:20.154 --> 37:21.155
Uh, no, Henry.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.492
-We're off this one.
-What?

37:24.575 --> 37:26.619
-Chief wants Division to handle it.
-He'll bury it.

37:26.702 --> 37:29.413
It's not possible.
There's too much media coverage.

37:29.497 --> 37:32.041
Besides, do we have six detectives
to put on two homicides?

37:32.833 --> 37:33.668
Of course not.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.628
Look, Henry, Whitney Barnes is dead.

37:35.711 --> 37:37.755
Lester Menley's dead.
The guy who killed them both is dead.

37:37.838 --> 37:40.174
Whatever happens,
this case doesn't make on the Hill.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.092
Yeah.

37:42.301 --> 37:43.844
-But...
-But?

37:44.762 --> 37:46.931
I liked her. Whitney.

37:47.431 --> 37:51.477
I'd like to see us get up to speed
on this Hotel Pershing homicide, okay?

37:51.560 --> 37:53.729
Nothing when we resumed
the perimeter search.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.690
Found the girl's name on a runaways list.

37:56.190 --> 37:58.276
I don't think that one's gonna make it
on the Hill either.

38:00.319 --> 38:01.821
-Lieutenant.
-Hi.

38:03.406 --> 38:06.492
Everyone's talking about you
down at the PD's office, Furillo.

38:06.575 --> 38:08.077
Oh, anything worth repeating?

38:08.160 --> 38:09.287
They think you're okay.

38:10.121 --> 38:10.955
Me, too.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.874
-To what?
-Hotel Warrick.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.503
I'll have to meet you there.

38:18.004 --> 38:18.838
Furillo.

38:18.921 --> 38:22.258
(stammers)
We have Esterhaus'... scattering.

38:24.093 --> 38:25.720
-What time?
-11:00.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.266
What I had in mind won't take that long.

38:38.441 --> 38:40.776
Joe, I owe you an apology.

38:41.527 --> 38:42.361
Which one?

38:42.903 --> 38:45.614
Well, I found out that this memo
came out of Division this morning.

38:45.698 --> 38:48.075
It's about my promotion,
6:00 a.m. it came out.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.911
Anybody could have seen
and just passed the word along.

38:51.370 --> 38:52.204
So?

38:53.039 --> 38:55.624
So I'm sorry, and I acted like a jerk.

38:57.084 --> 38:59.420
Forget it. How do you like it so far?

39:00.004 --> 39:01.047
Can't get enough of it.

39:01.380 --> 39:03.424
(woman screaming)

39:11.349 --> 39:13.476
(Mick growls)

39:19.023 --> 39:21.400
All right, just send
one prisoner at a time

39:21.484 --> 39:22.526
to go down to the bus.

39:22.610 --> 39:25.488
All other prisoners stay cuffed
or in a cell!

39:26.030 --> 39:29.533
Peyser, Jackson, I want more uniforms
up here to help the khaki officer--

39:29.617 --> 39:31.619
Book this... on obstructing!

39:32.328 --> 39:33.704
To all prisoners,

39:34.121 --> 39:36.582
if there is any more trouble here at all,

39:37.166 --> 39:41.295
I'm gonna tack on an obstructing!
That's 30 days extra for sure.

39:42.505 --> 39:43.339
That's it.

39:48.594 --> 39:49.428
Hey.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.223
I, um...

39:55.893 --> 39:58.813
I just wanted to tell you,
you just did a good job, Sarge.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.956
The fish was terrific. Thank you.

40:23.170 --> 40:24.004
(exhales)

40:32.012 --> 40:33.931
So... (clears throat)

40:35.599 --> 40:36.892
really taking karate lessons, huh?

40:37.852 --> 40:40.479
Well, I've been mugged twice
in the last two years.

40:40.563 --> 40:42.314
What's wrong
with wanting to defend yourself?

40:44.066 --> 40:45.693
Maybe not trying saved your life.

40:45.776 --> 40:48.070
Or maybe next time I won't be so lucky.

40:48.779 --> 40:51.282
You know, at least with the karate,
I'll have the option.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.826
Besides, I kind of like it, you know?

40:53.909 --> 40:56.412
And it makes me feel sexy.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.539
Great, you can crunch a brick in bed.

41:01.250 --> 41:04.503
That sounds like something you'd say
five years into a bad marriage.

41:06.046 --> 41:07.840
(sighs) Sorry.

41:10.176 --> 41:12.511
Just that I feel like
ever since we've been together,

41:13.345 --> 41:17.224
you've been trying to make me
into something I'm not.

41:18.517 --> 41:19.351
I don't like it.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.312
I'm not trying to change you.

41:21.395 --> 41:22.438
(sighs)

41:22.855 --> 41:27.276
But the fact is, and you know this,
every time we start to make love,

41:28.068 --> 41:31.614
something in your head goes click
and suddenly you're a million miles away.

41:32.406 --> 41:34.408
You know, sometimes I feel like
I'm alone in the bed.

41:34.492 --> 41:37.578
You kidding? There's you, there's me,
there's Rachel, Frank.

41:37.912 --> 41:40.414
Four kids. It's a complex negotiation

41:40.498 --> 41:42.708
just trying to find a place
to go to bed together.

41:42.791 --> 41:45.002
Then when we do do it,
we never seem to get to it.

41:46.128 --> 41:48.672
I mean, after-after getting past kids
knocking on the door,

41:48.756 --> 41:51.759
looking for a glass of water,
or babies needing to be fed.

41:52.635 --> 41:55.471
I feel sick, I feel angry, and tired

41:55.554 --> 41:57.473
and the last thing I feel is sexy.

41:58.891 --> 42:01.227
Henry, we are adults.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.729
We bring adult baggage
to our relationship.

42:03.812 --> 42:05.231
Do not lecture me, Fay.

42:07.525 --> 42:10.110
All I'm trying to tell you
is that after a lot of years

42:10.194 --> 42:13.489
of being a good guy,
good friend, a good husband,

42:13.572 --> 42:16.075
always trying to find out
what the other person needs,

42:16.158 --> 42:19.578
I'm beginning to get a little bit more...

42:20.788 --> 42:22.373
selfish about what I need.

42:22.790 --> 42:26.335
And what I need
is for things to be a lot easier.

42:28.003 --> 42:28.879
You want easy?

42:30.256 --> 42:31.465
Try a prostitute.

42:34.969 --> 42:35.928
Oh, boy.

42:38.722 --> 42:40.140
You really fixated on that.

42:41.642 --> 42:42.476
Didn't you?

42:42.851 --> 42:43.978
That was just a fantasy.

42:44.353 --> 42:46.647
If you want real life, I'm your girl.

42:46.730 --> 42:49.567
-But if you want a fantasy--
-Come on, Fay.

42:50.609 --> 42:52.486
It's not that easy and you know it.

42:53.862 --> 42:55.072
I have my baggage.

42:56.198 --> 42:57.658
I have my stretchmarks.

42:58.492 --> 43:02.246
I am too old to start apologizing
for what I can't change.

43:06.875 --> 43:07.876
What do we do now?

43:09.878 --> 43:10.921
I don't know.

43:12.965 --> 43:14.008
Maybe we ought to...

43:15.843 --> 43:17.219
not see each other for a while.

43:18.596 --> 43:19.680
Sounds right to me.

43:27.605 --> 43:28.606
If it's so right,

43:30.232 --> 43:31.692
why do I feel so lousy?

44:06.644 --> 44:07.478
Sorry.

44:08.145 --> 44:11.106
This everyone? Howard?

44:11.190 --> 44:13.692
We have large
aggregate particles here, Frank,

44:13.776 --> 44:15.069
with a high adhesion factor.

44:15.152 --> 44:18.155
We may have a problem
getting a uniform distribution.

44:18.447 --> 44:19.698
RENKO: What's he talking about?

44:20.282 --> 44:23.118
-The sarge is a little gritty.
-Oh.

44:23.202 --> 44:25.287
Putting him in the street like this.

44:25.371 --> 44:26.205
I don't know.

44:27.539 --> 44:29.833
In this city,
the cop belongs in the street.

44:29.917 --> 44:30.751
It's his home.

44:45.057 --> 44:45.891
Ray.

44:57.820 --> 44:58.737
Goodbye, Phil.

44:59.488 --> 45:00.614
My good friend.

45:09.832 --> 45:10.916
I don't know, Phil.

45:12.251 --> 45:13.085
Uh...

45:14.211 --> 45:15.170
keep in touch.

45:21.885 --> 45:22.928
(exhales)

45:25.889 --> 45:27.182
(blows)

45:29.268 --> 45:30.102
Leo.

45:31.562 --> 45:32.730
No. No.

45:38.152 --> 45:41.321
Home is the sailor
home from the sea, Phil.

45:43.073 --> 45:46.243
And the hunter home from the hill.

46:03.802 --> 46:05.012
So long, Sarge.

46:40.172 --> 46:42.216
(engine starts)

47:07.407 --> 47:08.242
Phil.

48:22.357 --> 48:25.360
(closing theme playing)
