LUGER'S BAIT AND TACKLE.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.156
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.156
THEY'RE SHUTTING DOWN.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.865
LUGER'S WIFE CAUGHT HIM

05:22.197 --> 05:23.865
AT THAT MOTEL

05:23.907 --> 05:26.868
WITH THE TRANSV--

05:23.907 --> 05:26.868
SISTOR RADIO,

05:26.910 --> 05:29.746
AND, UH,

05:26.910 --> 05:29.746
HE RETIRED HONORABLY.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.372
SO, WHAT ARE YOU HERE FOR?

05:31.414 --> 05:32.833
WE WERE WONDERING IF YOU WOULD

05:31.414 --> 05:32.833
SPONSOR OUR TEAM.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.460
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.920
YOU JUST HAVE TO BUY

05:35.502 --> 05:36.920
OUR JERSEYS.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.421
IT'LL SAY "LUKE'S DINER"

05:36.962 --> 05:38.421
ON THE BACK.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.756
PLUS OUR NAME --

05:38.463 --> 05:39.756
THE BOBCATS.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.967
AND YOU PITCH IN

05:39.798 --> 05:41.967
FOR TROPHIES IF WE WIN.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.303
BUT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE

05:42.009 --> 05:44.303
TO GO TO THE GAMES

05:42.009 --> 05:44.303
IF YOU DON'T WANT.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.804
YEAH.

05:44.343 --> 05:45.804
YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.974
GIRLS, NO OFFENSE,

05:45.846 --> 05:48.974
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.433
IT'S NOT MY THING.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.311
NO PROBLEM.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.311
THANK HIM FOR HIS TIME, GIRLS.

05:52.351 --> 05:53.312
THANK YOU.

05:53.352 --> 05:54.479
THANK YOU, MR. DANES.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.522
YOU'RE WELCOME.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.107
BYE.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.151
WELL, OLIVER TWIST

05:57.149 --> 05:59.151
JUST KINDLY ASKED

05:59.193 --> 06:00.485
FOR A LITTLE MORE GRUEL,

06:00.527 --> 06:02.361
AND YOU KICKED HIM

06:00.527 --> 06:02.361
RIGHT IN THE JUNK.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.990
WHO?

06:02.403 --> 06:04.990
YOU BROKE THOSE DARLING

06:02.403 --> 06:04.990
LITTLE GIRLS' HEARTS.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.116
THEY'LL FIND SOMEONE ELSE.

06:06.158 --> 06:07.366
HOW IS THIS NOT YOUR THING?

06:07.408 --> 06:09.161
I DON'T WANT TO COACH

06:07.408 --> 06:09.161
A SOCCER TEAM.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.745
THEY DON'T NEED A COACH.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.745
HOW CLOSELY WERE YOU LISTENING?

06:10.787 --> 06:12.331
WELL, NOT THAT CLOSELY.

06:12.371 --> 06:13.915
KIDS USUALLY TALK,

06:12.371 --> 06:13.915
BUT THEY DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.709
THEY JUST KIND OF YAMMER,

06:15.750 --> 06:17.961
SO IF YOU DON'T FIND THEM CUTE,

06:15.750 --> 06:17.961
THEY'RE JUST BORING.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.047
YOU SHOULD REALLY HAVE

06:18.003 --> 06:20.047
YOUR OWN CHILDREN'S SHOW,

06:20.088 --> 06:21.422
YOU KNOW, AS AN ALTERNATIVE

06:20.088 --> 06:21.422
TO THE NICE ONES.

06:21.464 --> 06:22.423
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.925
IT'S JUST A SPONSORSHIP,

06:23.967 --> 06:25.468
AND THEY'RE FROM

06:23.967 --> 06:25.468
YOUR ALMA MATER,

06:25.510 --> 06:26.845
WHICH, BY THE WAY,

06:26.887 --> 06:28.180
IS LOOKING DRAB

06:26.887 --> 06:28.180
AND COULD USE A TOUCH-UP.

06:28.222 --> 06:29.723
I'D RECOMMEND

06:28.222 --> 06:29.723
THE LIGHT SALMON.

06:29.764 --> 06:30.724
DOESN'T THAT MEAN

06:29.764 --> 06:30.724
SOMETHING?

06:30.765 --> 06:32.226
I GUESS A LITTLE.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.061
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE

06:32.267 --> 06:34.061
TO GO TO THE GAMES,

06:34.102 --> 06:36.980
AND YOU'D GET TO HAVE YOUR NAME

06:34.102 --> 06:36.980
ON THE BACK OF THE JERSEYS.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.773
FREE ADVERTISING --

06:37.022 --> 06:38.773
HOW COOL IS THAT?

06:38.815 --> 06:41.400
WELL, YEAH,

06:38.815 --> 06:41.400
THAT MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT.

06:41.442 --> 06:44.279
HEY, AND YOU'LL GET THAT PHOTO

06:41.442 --> 06:44.279
THAT SPONSORS GET

06:44.321 --> 06:46.823
OF THE WHOLE TEAM

06:44.321 --> 06:46.823
SITTING ON THE FIELD,

06:46.865 --> 06:49.743
AND YOU CAN DISPLAY IT

06:46.865 --> 06:49.743
LIKE AL'S PANCAKE WORLD DOES.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.579
OOH, AL -- THAT SEA-GREEN

06:49.784 --> 06:52.579
WITH BURNT-SIENNA TRIM.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.497
I WARNED YOU.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.541
I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY!

06:54.539 --> 06:56.541
COME ON. GIVE IT BACK, PLEASE.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.792
I'M JONESING.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.792
I NEED MY COLORS.

06:57.834 --> 06:58.752
PLEASE.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.340
THINK THEY'RE ANY GOOD?

07:03.382 --> 07:04.883
I DON'T KNOW

07:03.382 --> 07:04.883
IF THAT MATTERS.

07:07.635 --> 07:11.014
HEY, UH, IF YOU STILL

07:07.635 --> 07:11.014
WANT A SPONSOR,

07:11.056 --> 07:12.682
WE CAN GIVE IT

07:11.056 --> 07:12.682
A SHOT.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.475
REALLY?!

07:12.724 --> 07:14.475
YAY!

07:14.517 --> 07:16.519
OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL, LUKE.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.519
THANK YOU.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.272
I GUESS THIS IS YOU

07:16.561 --> 07:18.272
BEING GRATEFUL.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.941
FOR THE JERSEYS.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.443
YOU REALLY GET, LIKE, NO NOTICE

07:20.982 --> 07:23.443
ON THESE THINGS, DO YOU?

07:23.484 --> 07:26.529
NONE. IT'S A "GRAB YOUR BAG

07:23.484 --> 07:26.529
AND MEET ME AT THE TARMAC, SON,

07:26.571 --> 07:28.407
OVER AND OUT," AND IT'S ALWAYS

07:26.571 --> 07:28.407
AT AN UNGODLY HOUR.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.908
6:00 A.M.?

07:29.950 --> 07:31.410
THAT'S MY BEDTIME,

07:29.950 --> 07:31.410
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.953
WHERE'S HE DRAGGING YOU

07:31.451 --> 07:32.953
THIS TIME?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.788
A PAPER IN OMAHA.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.788
WHAT STATE IS THAT IN AGAIN?

07:34.829 --> 07:36.081
Nebraska.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.916
AH, CORN,

07:36.123 --> 07:37.916
FARM ANIMALS, FOOTBALL.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.501
OH, AND THEY LOVE CONDESCENSION

07:37.958 --> 07:40.501
IN NEBRASKA, TOO,

07:40.543 --> 07:42.754
SO HIT THEM WITH THAT

07:40.543 --> 07:42.754
AS SOON AS YOU DISEMBARK.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.589
WELL, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE FREE

07:42.796 --> 07:44.589
TONIGHT, MY DEAR,

07:44.631 --> 07:46.633
'CAUSE I'M GETTING THE GROUP

07:44.631 --> 07:46.633
TOGETHER FOR A BLOWOUT.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.009
DO NOT TELL ME

07:46.674 --> 07:48.009
YOU'RE WORKING.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.803
I CAN MAKE SOME TIME

07:48.051 --> 07:49.803
FOR YOU.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.347
OOPS.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.347
EVASIVE MANEUVER.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.224
What?

07:52.389 --> 07:54.224
My grandmother.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.268
Is she coming at you

07:54.266 --> 07:56.268
with a knife or something?

07:56.310 --> 07:58.645
IT'S ONE THING TO BE FORCED

07:56.310 --> 07:58.645
TO MOVE INTO THE BIG HOUSE,

07:58.686 --> 08:00.188
BUT NOW THE BIG HOUSE IS FEELING

07:58.686 --> 08:00.188
TOM THUMB TINY.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.940
MY GRANDMOTHER'S EVERYWHERE.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.234
THE OLDER GENERATION -- THEY

08:01.982 --> 08:04.234
HAVE THEIR METHODS OF UBIQUITY.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.861
I'm positive that there are

08:04.276 --> 08:06.861
at least five of her

08:06.903 --> 08:08.780
wandering the property

08:06.903 --> 08:08.780
like she's a Cylon.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.282
So, can you meet me out here

08:08.822 --> 08:10.282
tonight?

08:10.324 --> 08:11.325
Why are you whispering?

08:11.366 --> 08:12.784
Because you're whispering.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.077
THAT'S CUTE.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.620
I'LL SEE YOU AT YOUR PLACE?

08:14.119 --> 08:15.620
8:00?

08:15.662 --> 08:17.580
Perfect.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.580
SEE YOU THEN.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.957
RORY!

08:18.999 --> 08:20.375
OH, HI, GRANDMA.

08:20.417 --> 08:23.337
I WAS JUST HEADING OUT,

08:20.417 --> 08:23.337
IN KIND OF A HURRY.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.838
HEADING OUT WHERE?

08:24.879 --> 08:26.173
ERRANDS. JUST ERRANDS.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.882
YOU KNOW,

08:26.214 --> 08:27.882
SHANDINKA WOULD BE WILLING

08:27.924 --> 08:30.760
TO DO YOUR ERRANDS FOR YOU --

08:27.924 --> 08:30.760
SHE HAS A USED S.U.V.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.304
I CAN DO THEM MYSELF.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.848
IS SOMETHING WRONG

08:32.346 --> 08:34.848
WITH YOUR FACE?

08:32.346 --> 08:34.848
NO.

08:34.889 --> 08:35.807
WHY ARE YOU HIDING IT?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.144
IT LOOKS FINE.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.687
IT IS FINE.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.230
SO, ARE YOU STAYING

08:40.728 --> 08:42.230
OVERNIGHT

08:42.272 --> 08:43.690
AT PARIS' AGAIN THIS WEEK?

08:43.731 --> 08:45.233
MAYBE.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.233
THAT'S SO FUN --

08:45.275 --> 08:47.194
HAVING A GIRLFRIEND

08:45.275 --> 08:47.194
FOR SLEEPOVERS.

08:47.235 --> 08:49.404
YOU KNOW, PARIS CAN SLEEP OVER

08:47.235 --> 08:49.404
HERE SOMETIME IF YOU WANT.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.072
GREAT. THANKS.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.366
YOUR GRANDFATHER'S OUT OF TOWN

08:51.114 --> 08:52.366
FOR A FEW DAYS,

08:52.407 --> 08:53.700
SO IT'S JUST US GIRLS.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.160
GOT A PREFERENCE FOR DINNER

08:53.741 --> 08:55.160
TONIGHT?

08:55.202 --> 08:56.786
I MAY NOT MAKE IT FOR DINNER

08:55.202 --> 08:56.786
TONIGHT, GRANDMA.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.872
OH. I WAS LOOKING FORWARD

08:56.828 --> 08:58.872
TO IT.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.581
SORRY.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.168
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO GIVE

09:00.623 --> 09:03.168
24-HOURS NOTICE ON THESE THINGS.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.545
AGAIN, SORRY.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.964
YOU'RE LOOKING SKINNIER,

09:05.586 --> 09:07.964
AND YOU'RE SKIPPING DINNER.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.550
I'M NOT SKIPPING DINNER.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.550
I'M HAVING DINNER OUT.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.260
YOU'RE NOT BULIMIC?

09:12.302 --> 09:14.179
I<i> REALLY</i> HAVE TO GO,

09:12.302 --> 09:14.179
GRANDMA.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.515
ONE LAST THING -- THE RUSSIAN

09:14.221 --> 09:16.515
TEA FOR THE D.A.R. --

09:16.556 --> 09:17.807
THAT'S GOING WELL?

09:17.849 --> 09:19.642
YEAH.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.642
IT'S LIKE CLOCKWORK.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.228
IT'S AN EASY ONE.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.228
TEAS ARE EASY.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.063
OH! THAT REMINDS ME.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.981
I<i> REALLY</i> HAVE TO GO,

09:23.104 --> 09:24.981
GRANDMA --

09:25.023 --> 09:28.443
she said

09:25.023 --> 09:28.443
for the umpteenth time.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.237
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:30.278 --> 09:32.197
IT'S NICE.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.197
WHOSE IS IT?

09:32.239 --> 09:33.532
IT'S FOR YOU,

09:32.239 --> 09:33.532
FOR THE RUSSIAN TEA.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.533
WANT TO TRY IT ON?

09:34.574 --> 09:35.992
LATER. PLEASE.

09:36.034 --> 09:37.577
I REALLY,

09:36.034 --> 09:37.577
REALLY HAVE TO GO.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.204
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING

09:37.618 --> 09:39.204
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.414
DEFINITELY.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.664
SEE YOU LATER.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.553
OH, THIS IS HARD.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.553
THIS IS SO HARD.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.636
I KNOW.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.097
I CAN BE SO INDECISIVE.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.557
PUT ME IN FRONT OF A BIN

09:57.138 --> 09:58.557
OF CANTALOUPE,

09:58.598 --> 10:00.350
IT'LL TAKE ME AN HOUR

09:58.598 --> 10:00.350
TO PICK ONE -- AN HOUR!

10:00.392 --> 10:02.060
AND THIS IS HARDER

10:00.392 --> 10:02.060
THAN CANTALOUPE.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.853
COME ON.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.853
FOCUS, BABETTE.

10:03.895 --> 10:06.565
A GREEN, AN OFF-WHITE --

10:03.895 --> 10:06.565
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.316
THEY ALL SEEM FINE.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.817
SEE, I DON'T KNOW

10:08.358 --> 10:09.817
IF YOU'RE AWARE OF THIS,

10:09.859 --> 10:11.236
BUT IF PAINTERS ARE READY

10:09.859 --> 10:11.236
TO PAINT,

10:11.278 --> 10:12.904
AND YOU DON'T HAVE

10:11.278 --> 10:12.904
YOUR COLORS READY,

10:12.946 --> 10:14.531
THEY'LL LEAVE,

10:12.946 --> 10:14.531
AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN,

10:14.573 --> 10:15.990
SO THE CLOCK

10:14.573 --> 10:15.990
IS TICKING HERE.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.409
Luke: DON'T LET HER BULLY YOU,

10:16.032 --> 10:17.409
BABETTE.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.701
BUT I GOTTA PICK A COLOR!

10:18.743 --> 10:20.620
LORELAI'S GOTTA

10:18.743 --> 10:20.620

EVERYONE'S GONE.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.329
I HURT HER FEELINGS.

15:55.371 --> 15:58.124

15:55.371 --> 15:58.124
SHE'S USED TO IT. COME ON.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.293

16:00.334 --> 16:02.044
IT'S BORING.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.338
I KNOW.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.338
AND IT'S NOT HERE.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.507
COME ON. YEAH.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.760
I DON'T LIKE STEAKS OR INSURANCE

16:08.802 --> 16:10.511
OR ANYTHING ELSE

16:08.802 --> 16:10.511

16:10.553 --> 16:11.971

16:12.012 --> 16:13.598

16:12.012 --> 16:13.598

16:17.226 --> 16:20.187
I'M NOT MAKING YOU GO.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.187
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET YOU HOME.

16:20.229 --> 16:23.441
BUT GETTING ME HOME MEANS

16:20.229 --> 16:23.441

16:23.483 --> 16:26.527
AND WHEN I WAKE UP, I HAVE

18:10.715 --> 18:12.050

THIS IS NOT REALLY

18:12.091 --> 18:14.134
MY TASTE.

18:14.176 --> 18:17.346
YEAH, NOT UNLESS YOU'VE AGED

18:14.176 --> 18:17.346
ABOUT 90 YEARS.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.142
THIS IS JUST FOR A FUNCTION

18:19.515 --> 18:22.142
I HAVE TO GO TO.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.978
FUNCTION?

18:24.020 --> 18:25.772
IT'S JUST A JOB --

18:24.020 --> 18:25.772
THE D.A.R. --

18:25.813 --> 18:28.608
DAUGHTERS OF

18:25.813 --> 18:28.608
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.

18:28.649 --> 18:29.859
IT'S NOT A CAREER

18:28.649 --> 18:29.859
OR ANYTHING.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.736
I HOPE NOT.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.736
NO.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.404

18:33.446 --> 18:36.908
I'M JUST HERE TEMPORARILY.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.908
MY MOM AND I --

18:36.950 --> 18:38.158
LUKE ALLUDED TO SOMETHING.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.410
IT'S A LONG STORY.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.328
I WAS CRASHING

18:39.452 --> 18:41.328
IN THE POOL HOUSE,

18:41.370 --> 18:42.747
AND THAT WAS JUST TEMPORARY,

18:42.789 --> 18:44.707
BUT THE POOL HOUSE

18:42.789 --> 18:44.707
BECAME STORAGE,

18:44.749 --> 18:47.167
SO THEN I HAD TO MOVE

18:44.749 --> 18:47.167
INTO THE MAIN HOUSE.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.753
ALL TEMPORARY.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.755
ISN'T SCHOOL IN SESSION?

18:48.795 --> 18:50.755
MM-HMM.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.256
WHY AREN'T YOU LIVING

18:50.797 --> 18:52.256
ON CAMPUS?

18:52.298 --> 18:53.758
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.885

18:53.800 --> 18:55.885
DOOGIE?

18:55.927 --> 18:58.220

18:58.262 --> 18:59.931

18:59.973 --> 19:02.725
SO, WHERE ARE YOU LIVING,

18:59.973 --> 19:02.725

19:02.767 --> 19:05.103
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOU --

19:02.767 --> 19:05.103
MYSTERY MAN.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.729
I'M IN PHILLY.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.188
DON'T LAUGH.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.523

19:08.230 --> 19:09.523
PHILADELPHIA'S GOTTEN COOL.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.818
AND NEW YORK'S

19:09.565 --> 19:11.818
GOTTEN EXPENSIVE.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.736
ANYWAY, IT'S A PRETTY COOL SCENE

19:11.859 --> 19:13.736
IN PHILLY NOW --

19:13.778 --> 19:15.446
LOT OF YOUNGER PEOPLE

19:13.778 --> 19:15.446
THERE...

19:15.488 --> 19:17.073
PRETTY BIG ART SCENE.

19:17.115 --> 19:18.992
I KNOW. I READ THAT

19:17.115 --> 19:18.992
IN<i> THE NEW YORK TIMES.</i>

19:19.033 --> 19:21.160
THEY HAD A PICTURE OF A BUNCH

19:19.033 --> 19:21.160
OF YOUNG PEOPLE

19:21.201 --> 19:22.829
STANDING ON A ROOF,

19:21.201 --> 19:22.829
KIND OF ECLECTIC AND ALL.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.163
IT LOOKED FUN.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.331
I MEAN, IT WAS CLEARLY

19:24.204 --> 19:25.331
ONE OF THOSE PICTURES

19:25.372 --> 19:27.625
THAT WASN'T CANDID.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.961
IT WAS LOOKING A LITTLE STIFF,

19:27.667 --> 19:29.961
BUT THEY LOOKED HAPPY.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.839
ARE YOU NERVOUS?

19:32.880 --> 19:36.092
A LITTLE.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.092
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.301
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS, TOO.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.761
GOOD. I'M NOT ALONE.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.680
SO, I DIDN'T JUST COME HERE

19:38.803 --> 19:40.680
TO CHAT.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.264
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU

19:40.721 --> 19:42.264
SOMETHING.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.224
RIGHT. YOU SAID THAT.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.810
AND I DIDN'T THINK

19:44.266 --> 19:45.810
YOU'D BELIEVE IT

19:45.852 --> 19:48.312
IF I DIDN'T SHOW IT TO YOU

19:45.852 --> 19:48.312
IN PERSON.

19:48.354 --> 19:52.066
WELL, COLOR ME CURIOUS.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.615
YOU WROTE A BOOK?

19:57.864 --> 19:59.615

20:02.827 --> 20:04.954

20:04.996 --> 20:06.622
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WERE HIGH

20:04.996 --> 20:06.622
OR SOMETHING,

20:06.664 --> 20:08.415
BUT THEY DECIDED

20:06.664 --> 20:08.415
TO PUBLISH IT.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.415
YOU WROTE A BOOK.

20:08.457 --> 20:09.750
THERE'S NO MONEY IN IT.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.086
THEY ONLY PRINTED

20:09.792 --> 20:12.086
LIKE 500 OF THEM.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.338
BELIEVE ME,

20:12.128 --> 20:14.338
I'M NOT QUITTING MY DAY JOB.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.923
BUT YOU WROTE IT.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.468
AND WROTE A NOVEL.

20:19.510 --> 20:22.180
AUTHOR-DISTRIBUTED, TOO.

20:19.510 --> 20:22.180

20:22.221 --> 20:24.557
I'M GOING AROUND BEGGING

20:22.221 --> 20:24.557

SO PEOPLE SEE IT AND BUY IT.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.703
READ IT FIRST.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.621
THAT WAY YOU CAN DISCOURAGE

20:45.745 --> 20:47.621
PEOPLE FROM BUYING IT.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.082
NO WAY!

SUCH A GREAT BRAIN.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.001
I KNEW THAT

20:50.875 --> 20:52.001
IF YOU COULD JUST SIT DOWN

20:52.043 --> 20:53.252
AND STOP SHAKING IT AROUND,

20:53.293 --> 20:54.461
YOU COULD DO SOMETHING

20:53.293 --> 20:54.461
LIKE THIS.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.922
I KNEW IT.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.091

21:05.223 --> 21:07.100
