[Chang] American barbecue
is distinctly American.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.089
I'm really interested in how
the rest of the world barbecues.

00:48.673 --> 00:51.050
I see a lot of similarities
in all the cultures.

00:52.302 --> 00:56.639
What if I just cooked Korean barbecue
like an American barbecue place?

01:05.190 --> 01:07.108
[narrator] Junior, he's always hungry.

01:08.234 --> 01:11.446
The pop and sizzle of the juicy meat
seems to say,

01:11.529 --> 01:13.823
"Come and get me. I'm done to a turn."

01:23.875 --> 01:27.086
Our barbecue is prepared
with just the right amount of heat

01:27.170 --> 01:30.882
to keep in the natural juices
and hold in that wonderful flavor.

[Lang] I started in fine dining
French cuisine,

03:02.891 --> 03:07.562
because there was just some
mystical quality that drew me in.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.733
You can find the same things in barbecue.

03:12.734 --> 03:16.988
Log by log.
Ten, twelve, fifteen hours sometimes.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.490
I mean, you get that same engagement,

03:20.033 --> 03:23.369
because it's about heart
that's in the chef that's cooking it.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.168
Cooking with fire,
it's about connection to me.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.006

03:43.598 --> 03:44.724
Oh, wow.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.852
I told you last time,

03:47.936 --> 03:50.980
you should just open up a restaurant
where this is like sushi.

03:51.064 --> 03:51.940
Exactly, right?

03:52.023 --> 03:53.983
[Peter Meehan] It could just be one table
at a casino like this,

03:54.067 --> 03:55.944
where you just deal out slices of beef.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.612
-[Gray] It's beautiful.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.864
-That's gold, right there.
-[Gray] Mmm.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.493
-All right, fine. I'll taste it.
-[Gray laughs]

04:04.035 --> 04:05.078
Mmm.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.958
-Awesome.
-There's really nothing quite like this.

04:10.041 --> 04:14.587
I would pay as much money
as I pay in the top sushi restaurants

04:14.671 --> 04:19.801
to just sit down, have a nice glass
of wine or a cold beer, this...

04:19.884 --> 04:24.013
Like, why does a steak house
have to be what it is?

04:26.641 --> 04:29.435
[Meehan] A decade ago,
you were pushing crazy boundaries.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.938
I mean, I remember one time
coming to Daisy May's,

04:32.021 --> 04:36.192
and there was a baby goat covered in,
like, dried cherries on the table.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.110
I remember cooking that.

04:37.193 --> 04:41.197
Those were amazing meals. It seems like
your barbecue has changed over time.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.409
I think that traditional barbecue
is freaking unbelievable,

04:44.492 --> 04:45.994
and I don't wanna change that.

04:46.077 --> 04:49.998
But, for me, I don't look at it
as barbecue when I'm cooking it.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.667
I really look at it
as just live-fire cooking.

04:52.750 --> 04:58.339
Beef and pork with fire
create a super flavor.

04:58.423 --> 05:04.095
You tap into something really fundamental,
I think, about humans.

05:04.178 --> 05:07.473
What advice do you give to people
who are trying to get into barbecue?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.058
Just watch the smoke.

05:16.941 --> 05:20.737
[Meehan] I've been working on
a barbecue book for, like, a yearish now

05:20.820 --> 05:23.072
and done a lot of cooking myself.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.992
When I was writing for the Times,

05:26.075 --> 05:30.371
it was during the first blossoming
of barbecue in New York City.

05:31.122 --> 05:34.751
So that was when I got to be more critical
about it and started writing about it.

05:35.293 --> 05:38.796
And then recently, it's just become
what we do during the summer.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.548
Cook food for everybody

05:40.631 --> 05:43.801

If you're from a place that doesn't
have a deep barbecue tradition,

05:49.015 --> 05:51.601
your entry into what barbecue is

05:51.684 --> 05:55.855
is gonna be this kind of carnival
barker-style battle between places.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.073
[indistinct chatter]

We are in the middle of America doing it.

And, I mean,
it's gruesome or it's beautiful.

And what we try to do here
is to mimic those styles of cooking.

[Elliot Moss] A lot of times,
Carolina style is what I call it.

06:44.487 --> 06:47.490
It's whole hog, vinegar, pepper,

06:49.909 --> 06:52.370
[Pat Martin] The one thing I love
about Carolina barbecue

06:52.453 --> 06:54.789
is they put the skins in there with it.

06:54.872 --> 06:55.915

We don't want the skin to get brittle,

[Carey Bringle] A true dry rib is smoked
with nothing on it except for kosher salt.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.493
And then, we have a barbecue seasoning.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.621
It's not heavy in salt or heavy in sugar
like a rub would be.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.832
You get the full flavor of the pork,

07:37.915 --> 07:40.793
and you get the brightness
of all the spices as a salt substitute.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.670
And that's a true dry rib.

the first time I had Carolina style,

07:45.923 --> 07:49.802
it was unrecognizable to me
as being barbecue.

07:49.886 --> 07:54.974
My expectation being Texas style were like
whole cuts of meat, like ribs and brisket.

07:55.057 --> 07:58.811
[Bringle] Growing up in Tennessee,
they did not consider beef barbecue.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.940

that's a steak." And, "Go to Texas."

there weren't barbecue restaurants,

08:37.642 --> 08:39.309
so there wasn't an individual style.

08:39.393 --> 08:42.563

12:26.036 --> 12:31.167
Right? There won't be a distillation to,
like, the easiest version of what it is.

12:32.334 --> 12:36.213
[Chang] I look at the spread,
and this is epic.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.966
I don't have to wait for a server
being, like, "Next course."

12:39.049 --> 12:42.595
This is modern-day eating.
People can customize what they want.

12:42.678 --> 12:43.762
It's interactive.

12:43.846 --> 12:47.766
It didn't resonate with me as someone
that was a professional cook,

12:48.767 --> 12:50.186
until, like, now.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.438
I wanna open up a Korean restaurant.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.648
-You wanna open a Korean restaurant?
-I do, I do.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.026
[laughs] Cut his legs out right now.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.236
-There's no authenticity.
-I know.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.072
-Like I'm a Korean Vanilla Ice?
-[laughs]

13:02.156 --> 13:03.991
-[Choe] You are a Korean Vanilla Ice.
-Yeah, I am.

13:04.074 --> 13:06.160
I take Korean self-loathing
to another level.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.620
Korean Vanilla Ice, though?

13:08.245 --> 13:11.499
Just do the rest of the show in Korean.
Let's hear how good your Korean is.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.876
No. I'm like a Korean
that was adopted by white parents,

13:13.959 --> 13:15.836
that has an Asian woman fetish.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.505
[all laughing]

13:22.176 --> 13:25.596
[Chang] Places and locations
that are sort of cut off from the world,

13:25.679 --> 13:28.933
you can actually create something
that's never been done before,

13:29.016 --> 13:32.061
because you're not really
copying anyone else.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.905
[Rene Redzepi] Barbecuing is not just
big chunks of meat cooking for hours,

13:42.988 --> 13:44.657
tasting a lot like smoke.

13:45.449 --> 13:47.535
It can also be very gentle cooking.

13:48.536 --> 13:52.831
Cooking on fire has become the only way
that we really cook,

13:52.915 --> 13:56.502
like, big item things,
like the bone marrows here.

13:56.585 --> 13:59.213
These are some of the items
that we use to flavor.

13:59.296 --> 14:01.590
You have stuff like blackcurrant wood.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.592
Chew on this end.

14:05.553 --> 14:06.428
Yes.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.098
There's so much flavor in this wood.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.225
It actually tastes
like blackcurrant leaves.

14:12.851 --> 14:15.980
So when you barbecue with this,
this flavor actually

14:16.605 --> 14:19.066
sort of enters the meat.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.863
This is the spruce wood. Take this one.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.739
Mmm!

14:25.823 --> 14:27.449
-Can you taste the grapefruit?
-Yeah.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.909
It's incredible.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.370
From a Christmas tree,
you can have grapefruit flavor.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.582
-Why don't we cook the leaves?
-Okay.

14:35.165 --> 14:37.710
And then it's just gonna get
this gentle smoke.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.629
Enough so that it cooks
and kind of crisps up a little bit.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.131
This is also barbecuing.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.926
[Chang] You know, having learned
over a French oven,

14:46.010 --> 14:50.222
making sure your cuisson is perfect on it,
is it harder to cook it over open flame?

14:50.306 --> 14:51.640
Of course.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.058
We've grown up in this period

14:53.142 --> 14:57.521
where the technique and the water baths
and everything,

14:57.605 --> 15:00.399
and we sort of found
our way back into this.

15:00.482 --> 15:05.112
But that level of attention
that you need to have when you cook here

15:05.195 --> 15:06.864
actually makes for a better result.

15:06.947 --> 15:07.990
Let's taste some.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.953
-Now they're changed completely.
-Yeah.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.874
Ultimately, the cooking
happens in your eyes,

15:16.957 --> 15:20.669
when you smell,
on the tip of your fingers.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.755
That's when real good cooking happens.

15:22.838 --> 15:26.634
When you are able to put
all those sensibilities into the moment.

15:27.384 --> 15:29.261
You ever get a customer from Texas?

15:29.345 --> 15:30.721
Big old guy with a cowboy hat,

15:30.804 --> 15:32.681
and you're telling him,
"This is barbecued vegetables."

15:32.765 --> 15:35.809
We had one who said, "Your portions
sure are small here." [laughs]

15:35.893 --> 15:37.478
[Chang] They're gonna be like,
"This ain't barbecue."

15:37.561 --> 15:39.813
How do you say it is?
Or does it even matter to you?

15:39.897 --> 15:41.148
No, I don't care.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.778
-I don't care, I mean...
-That is so fucking good.

15:46.737 --> 15:51.283
[Rene] Barbecue to me just represents
cooking something in embers

15:51.367 --> 15:52.910
and flaming with smoke.

15:52.993 --> 15:55.120
So, to me, this is as much barbecue,

15:55.204 --> 15:58.791
even though it's Brussels sprout
in the late winter season,

15:58.874 --> 16:04.380
as that big slab of meat that, in Texas,
you'd consider to be barbecue.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.631
In fact, I like this better.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.762
[indistinct chatter]

16:16.642 --> 16:19.979
[Bringle] People get caught up in pits
and people get caught up in fuels.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.398
They really get passionate about it.

16:22.481 --> 16:27.111
I'm passionate about telling people,
"Don't tell me how to cook my shit, okay?"

16:27.194 --> 16:28.862
-[all chuckling]
-It's about...

16:29.613 --> 16:32.408
It's about what ends up on your plate.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.828
All right. I think this hog is ready.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.955
We're gonna take it,
and I'm gonna let my friend Elliot

16:38.038 --> 16:40.124
come up here and show you
how the North Carolinians do it.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.467
I'd decided I wanted to open
my own restaurant,

16:50.551 --> 16:53.554
and barbecue has just always
been in my heart.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.431
Being a chef in Asheville,

16:55.514 --> 16:58.100
people really care
about where their food comes from.

16:58.183 --> 17:02.021
I wanted to do barbecue
with pasture-raised hogs.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.772
I'm coming to find out
that these hogs are expensive,

17:04.857 --> 17:06.692
and so we don't waste anything.

17:06.775 --> 17:11.030
Every part of this animal
will get used some way or the other.

17:11.113 --> 17:14.366
We get half our hogs from South Carolina.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.994
Greg Moore, he's raising
some really nice pigs out there,

17:18.078 --> 17:20.079
and we cut the jowls off.

17:20.164 --> 17:23.459
And we actually
just hang those over the pits,

17:23.541 --> 17:26.295
and they get, like, a nice natural...
just smoke in...

17:27.378 --> 17:31.175
One other thing we do,
we cook a lot of stuff underneath the pig.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.635
Our green beans and all kind of things.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.847
And this fat just kind of drips
right in the pan, right over it.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.433
But one thing in the barbecue business,

17:39.516 --> 17:42.102
people just do not wanna
spend money on barbecue.

17:45.355 --> 17:50.069
And for the amount of labor and love
and how many people's hands touch it,

17:50.152 --> 17:53.363
it should be one
of the most expensive things

17:53.447 --> 17:55.074
you could buy for food.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.160
[sizzling]

17:59.161 --> 18:01.371
-[Kim] Are you from North Korea?
-My dad's from North Korea.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.290
My dad's from North Korea, too.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.459
-That explains everything.
-Right?

18:05.542 --> 18:07.961
You're the best-fed North Korean
that I've ever seen.

18:08.045 --> 18:09.004
[Choe and Chang laugh]

18:09.088 --> 18:10.964
I'm gonna be activated
by Kim Jong-Eun soon.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.299
[laughing]

18:12.382 --> 18:14.760
-He's a sleeper...
-Yeah, a sleeper cell.

18:14.843 --> 18:18.430
Why can't you cook Korean barbecue
like American barbecue?

18:18.514 --> 18:21.100
Yeah. I bet it'd be delicious.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.644
Then there's no delineation
of one's Korean

18:23.727 --> 18:25.687
and one's barbecue-barbecue.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.315
-What do you mean? Like with sauce?
-Like in a smoker.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.399
Oh, I see.

18:29.483 --> 18:33.695
'Cause I've been to Korean restaurants
where it's actually wood in here.

18:33.779 --> 18:34.780
You know what I mean?

18:34.863 --> 18:40.369
So, like, what if our ancestors
moved to Texas 200 years ago?

18:40.452 --> 18:42.871
Of course they'd use the barbecue methods.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.206
[Yeun] That's true.

18:44.289 --> 18:47.084
That's a natural evolution.
Because it's gonna happen, right?

18:47.167 --> 18:48.877
[Yeun] But in the future,
things will look different, too.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.047
I mean, the world is so much smaller
than it ever was.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.674
You have access to things...

18:53.757 --> 18:55.592
Like, you opened and unlocked the door

18:55.676 --> 18:57.803
for every single person
to watch that shit.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.555
You had a bigger impact than we did.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.099
No, I'm talking about food,
which is the save-all for--

19:02.182 --> 19:05.185
-But I actually think--
-He had sex on TV with a white girl.

19:05.269 --> 19:08.564
It was very positive for Asian-Americans.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.565
-Very positive.
-I agree.

19:09.648 --> 19:14.736
I had heard that on the show Walking Dead,
the most popular TV show in America,

19:14.820 --> 19:17.197
that a Korean guy
was gonna have sex with a white girl.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.449
So I got my whole family together,
I got my mom,

19:19.533 --> 19:21.493
and we sat in front of the TV,
and I was like,

19:21.577 --> 19:23.662
"I hope this guy does a good job.

19:23.745 --> 19:27.875
I need to see him fuck with passion
and, you know, vigor, and..."

19:27.958 --> 19:28.959
and he did it.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.962
And he pulled his pants down.
And I was like,

19:32.045 --> 19:33.380
"Mom, he's doing a good job, right?"

19:33.463 --> 19:36.133
[both breathing heavily]

19:36.216 --> 19:39.136
That's a historic moment for Asian men.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.555
It has never been documented.

19:41.638 --> 19:42.973
You were the first.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.184
You're like Rosa Parks.
You're like Jackie Robinson.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.394
You're Rosa Parks with...

19:49.104 --> 19:50.647
[Kim] We'll cut it for you.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.066
-Don't worry, he's wearing red.
-[all laughing]

19:54.276 --> 19:55.319
Oh, God.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.155
[Chang] I'm sorry I brought him.
I really am.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.949
-I don't need a knife.
-[laughs]

20:07.831 --> 20:09.458
[indistinct chatter]

20:15.631 --> 20:19.426
[Chang] I haven't been to this area
in, like, 15 years.

20:19.509 --> 20:22.012
-You've lived in China for a little bit.
-[Choe] Yeah.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.348
-Have you ever eaten street meat before?
-Yeah, I love it.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.724
It's awesome.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.517
Oh, man, this shit is spicy.

20:29.519 --> 20:32.022
So hot. This is so good.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.024
-[Choe] What is this?
-Sugar. It's caramel.

20:34.107 --> 20:36.026
Like, we can bring stuff here
to get caramelized?

20:36.777 --> 20:38.403
Tell me if we find something good,

20:38.487 --> 20:40.030
we'll bring it to get caramelized.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.407
Tell him I want
the duck face and the claw.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.409
[speaking Chinese]

20:48.830 --> 20:51.500
[Chang in English] I'm not involved
in this fucking monstrosity.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.876
We're back.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.837
Sometimes great ideas
come from crazy shit like this.

20:55.921 --> 20:59.925
[in Chinese accent] You got the duck face
and the duck claw and the candy

21:00.008 --> 21:03.637
and the sexy and the salty and the sweet.
And you mix together...

21:03.720 --> 21:07.015
Okay. Now, do one
with a normal accent, asshole.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.351
[Choe] I'm like Dave's side bitch
that he's embarrassed of.

21:12.938 --> 21:13.939
Oh, my God.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.358
[Chang] Here's the thing with Choe.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.734
Any time I'm with him,

21:17.818 --> 21:22.572
it's a guarantee I will lose my temper
and get upset or be embarrassed.

21:22.656 --> 21:27.119
But I always think of Dave
as the guitarist in Spinal Tap,

21:27.202 --> 21:28.662
when he's like,"I gotta take it to 11."

21:29.663 --> 21:35.502
People expect Asians as a whole
to be subservient, right? Quiet.

21:35.585 --> 21:38.630
You're talking to the two
loudest Asians I know.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.716
I'm louder than you are,
which is fucking amazing.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.176
If you're Asian and you're on television,

21:43.260 --> 21:47.097
you have to either talk with an accent,
know some form of martial arts,

21:47.180 --> 21:48.682
or you have to be homosexual.

21:48.765 --> 21:50.183
That's what's accepted.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.561
As Asian-Americans,
I think we get a ghetto pass

21:52.644 --> 21:54.104
to make fun of all the Asians.

21:54.187 --> 21:57.899
Chinese, Japanese, even the jungle Asians,
Vietnamese, all of them.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.443
That's what I think.

22:00.193 --> 22:02.529
-[laughs]
-That's why you don't have many friends.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.032
I don't know why you're even my friend.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.533
I wonder the same thing.

22:07.659 --> 22:11.496
This is like the Heart of Darkness.
The further we go, more delicious.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.165
Wait, what is this?

22:13.874 --> 22:15.876
Donkey? Donkey?

22:15.959 --> 22:18.253
-There's donkey in here.
-No, let's go.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.757
-Can you not eat a donkey?
-No, I'm not eating a fucking jackass.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.258
[Choe] Eddie Murphy from Shrek.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.427
I just vomited in my throat.

22:25.510 --> 22:28.889
-You don't wanna try it?
-I'm not gonna eat that.

22:28.972 --> 22:29.890
-Why?
-It's fucking wrong.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.725
-Okay, fine.
-That's Armageddon food.

22:31.808 --> 22:34.102
When there's nothing left
on the planet to eat.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.353
You've had the donkey before?

22:35.437 --> 22:36.313
[Feng] Yeah!

22:36.396 --> 22:38.023
I would say it's the best meat in Beijing.

22:38.106 --> 22:39.900
Chinese people say the best food...

22:39.983 --> 22:41.401
the best meat is dragon,

22:41.485 --> 22:43.195
which doesn't exist...

22:43.278 --> 22:46.198
-Do you know where the dragon meat is?
-I'd rather eat dragon--

22:46.281 --> 22:47.532
Where's the dragon meat?

22:47.616 --> 22:48.617
It doesn't exist!

22:48.700 --> 22:49.743
So donkey is the best.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.995
Wait, the donkey is the best meat
you've ever had?

22:52.079 --> 22:53.121
Yeah.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.664
-Let's go eat the donkey.
-So far.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.166
Dude, I'm not eating a donkey!

22:56.249 --> 22:58.710
-Let's have one bite.
-No, you can eat it. I protest.

22:58.794 --> 23:01.630
He said it's the number two meat,
after dragon.

23:01.713 --> 23:02.923
[Chang laughing]

23:03.006 --> 23:05.467
I'm sorry I brought him to this country.

23:09.554 --> 23:14.184
I don't wanna make light of something
that is culturally significant here.

23:14.935 --> 23:19.064
It's not a joke, but it's also
part of Chinese culture, so...

23:19.689 --> 23:21.441
I don't take it for granted.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.860
I just choose not to eat it.

23:23.944 --> 23:27.030
The world should be blessed
to have Dave Choe around.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.032
He's a special person.

23:29.116 --> 23:34.830
[Choe] Number one meat, donkey.
Number two, dragon.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.915
-[Chang] What's number three?
-The others.

23:36.998 --> 23:38.625
-[Chang] Everything else?
-That depends how you cook it.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.377
You're the worst fucking chef ever.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.379
Thank you. A lot of people
feel the same way.

23:42.462 --> 23:46.716
The meat is super tender and flaky,
and the bun is awesome. It's fried.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.718
Would you eat donkey back in LA?

23:48.802 --> 23:50.762
I'll eat donkey dick,
the balls, the whole thing.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.639
This is why I don't bring you
to nice places, Dave.

23:52.722 --> 23:55.100
Oh, okay. All right, let's go eat
some other shit.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.110
[Chang] I think Peking duck

24:05.193 --> 24:09.072
is one of the great culinary pleasures
one could have.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.533
[Choe] How old is this tradition
of Peking duck?

24:11.616 --> 24:15.996
They've had roasting ducks in China
for about 700 or 800 years.

24:16.079 --> 24:21.376
It's a 30-day-old duck that is fattened up
so it's really nice and plump.

24:22.961 --> 24:27.048
These ovens... Is the wood designed
always to be cooked out front?

24:27.132 --> 24:29.342
And how does the heat sort of work out?

24:29.426 --> 24:32.971
[Dunlop] So, here they're using, um,
Chinese date. Jujube wood.

24:33.054 --> 24:36.558
And he's saying the reason
that it's outside the oven like that

24:36.641 --> 24:38.560
is so the smoke can come out.

24:38.643 --> 24:42.397
So you've got the heat in the oven,
but some of the smoke gets sucked out.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.649
But the wood is imparting some flavor?

24:44.733 --> 24:47.444
They don't really want
to have a smoked flavor to the duck.

24:47.527 --> 24:49.196
[Chang] But when they bring the duck out,

24:49.279 --> 24:51.489
they're giving it a little dance
in front of the smoke.

24:51.573 --> 24:53.074
[in Mandarin] What is the reason
for giving them a "dance"?

24:53.158 --> 24:54.034
To get smoky flavor?

24:54.117 --> 24:55.035
No.

24:55.118 --> 24:57.579
[in English] No, no, no, no.
He keeps saying no.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.168
It's a classic restaurant dish,

25:03.251 --> 25:05.587
and it originally was
an imperial palace food.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.796
You can't make this at home.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.715
No, you can't make it properly at home.

25:08.798 --> 25:10.759
And it's experiential dining,

25:10.842 --> 25:12.552
much like barbecue is, right?

25:13.220 --> 25:16.681
[Chang] And I think it's so important
to notice why the bottom is still intact.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.434
-It steams the meat from the inside.
-[Dunlop] Yeah.

25:19.517 --> 25:22.520
It's so technique-driven. It's so precise.

25:23.605 --> 25:26.858
And at the end of the day,
it is so celebratory to eat.

25:26.942 --> 25:31.071
It's not tricky. It's not textural.
It's got universal appeal.

25:31.154 --> 25:33.490
I thought the duck
was having sex with my mouth.

25:33.573 --> 25:35.742
Looks tan and all slicked out.

25:35.825 --> 25:36.993
It's very sexual.

25:37.869 --> 25:40.914
Oh, look at that, they're rubbing it down.
That's sexy.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.207
-[Dunlop] Little massage.
-[Choe] Yeah.

25:42.290 --> 25:45.252
Looks like he's rubbing sun-tan oil
on a tan butt.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.129
-Hi. [speaks in Mandarin]
-[Chang] Hi.

25:48.964 --> 25:52.133
[Dunlop in English] This is the special
knife that's only used for Peking duck.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.261
[Choe] It's so, like, surgical, like...

25:54.344 --> 25:55.679
[Chang] Oh, my God.

25:55.762 --> 26:00.976
[Choe] Very romantic. The sun setting.
Light's hitting the duck just right.

26:01.059 --> 26:01.977
[laughs]

26:03.270 --> 26:05.272
-[Choe] This is...
-[Dunlop] Really a work of art.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.648
[Choe] Yeah.

26:06.731 --> 26:08.483
[Dunlop] A trained, um, Peking duck chef

26:08.566 --> 26:11.403
can cut the duck
into more than 100 pieces.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.448
Firstly, have the skin,
dip it in white sugar

26:15.532 --> 26:19.411
to taste the original fragrance,
without any of the trimmings.

26:22.455 --> 26:24.791
-It's so good. Fuck it.
-[Choe] It's so good.

26:24.874 --> 26:25.917
[Choe chuckles]

26:26.835 --> 26:29.587
You should really eat this
as fast as possible while it's hot.

26:29.671 --> 26:32.340
[Choe] It's no donkey meat,
but it's pretty good.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.883
He ate donkey yesterday.

26:33.967 --> 26:36.970
-See? She loves donkey, dude.
-It's delicious.

26:37.053 --> 26:39.431
-You don't know who you're eating with.
-[Dunlop chuckles]

26:39.514 --> 26:40.849
You think you know everything.

26:40.932 --> 26:43.852
[Dunlop] If you like beef,
you'd like donkey meat.

26:44.477 --> 26:46.604
It's really one of the best things
in the world to eat.

26:49.524 --> 26:55.488
♪ Have you seen
Have you seen those meat trees ♪

26:56.573 --> 27:02.120
♪ Those trees of meat
Growing towards the sun ♪

27:05.498 --> 27:11.338
♪ Leaves of meat are falling
Into the meat grass ♪

27:12.422 --> 27:14.966
So, you're just waiting
for some of this to drop through?

27:15.050 --> 27:17.635
Um, yeah, just keepin' it goin'.

27:23.516 --> 27:25.685
[Moss] You know, working with fire is...

27:26.436 --> 27:29.272
Maybe it's the pyromaniac in me,
I don't know,

27:29.356 --> 27:31.358
but there's a lot of people
that cook barbecue,

27:31.441 --> 27:33.860
and it's the fire, I think,
that draws them to it.

27:38.865 --> 27:41.659
I hardly get much alone time,
and when I do,

27:41.743 --> 27:43.244
I love it being at night.

27:52.879 --> 27:55.006
I feel like cooking pigs is...

27:55.924 --> 27:59.302
It's almost like a psychedelic adventure
or journey.

28:02.138 --> 28:03.932
Sweating, being hot.

28:04.015 --> 28:07.310
The way your mind works
after being awake for 20 hours.

28:07.394 --> 28:11.189
You know, like,
"Whoa, man, I'm starting to feel crazy."

28:12.607 --> 28:18.029
Just being so exhausted,
but also so physically stimulated

28:18.113 --> 28:21.699
that sometimes I can't tell
if I'm awake or if I'm dreaming.

28:26.413 --> 28:29.499
It's fascinating at night, alone.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.545
Just you and the pig,
but that pig's not talking to you.

28:33.628 --> 28:34.879
[chuckles] Just the fire.

28:37.006 --> 28:41.136
And then the sun comes up,
and it's almost like a recharge, you know?

28:41.219 --> 28:44.681
It's like, "Okay, sun's up now.
You can get some coffee.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.142
I got this. We made it through the night."

28:47.225 --> 28:48.476
It's a journey, you know?

28:50.895 --> 28:52.230
A little bit lower.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.233
-It's gonna be a little bit.
-[Bringle] A little bit?

28:56.526 --> 28:57.902
[indistinct chatter]

29:02.282 --> 29:04.325
[Bringle] This is all just
its own natural juices.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.244
There's no other thing in this injection.

29:06.327 --> 29:09.122
There's nothing but fat from the hog.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.459
À la naturel.

29:14.919 --> 29:18.423
Pretty much, I think y'all can agree
this is the best-looking hog out here.

29:18.506 --> 29:20.925
-[man] Yeah, keep going.
-[laughing]

29:44.491 --> 29:45.950
[Mills] That's a piece of bacon.

29:46.034 --> 29:48.912
I wish the whole hog was bacon,
but it's not.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.959
[Moss] Everybody at the restaurant
asks why we don't have ribs.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.628
[people chuckle]

30:04.511 --> 30:06.471
[Mills] You build a barbecue.
Remember that.

30:06.554 --> 30:09.015
You build the flavors as you go.

30:09.098 --> 30:11.976
So you can take it any way
that you want it to go

30:12.060 --> 30:14.521
with either a dry rib and/or a liquid.

30:15.688 --> 30:16.856
[indistinct chatter]

30:23.112 --> 30:24.113
[Mills] Some bacon.

30:24.197 --> 30:27.909
Help yourselves,
and I was hoping to feed the farmer first,

30:27.992 --> 30:29.994
uh, since this is his pig.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.080
-[farmer] Can't thank you enough.
-[Moss] Yes, sir.

30:33.122 --> 30:35.083
I'll try some of that. Thank you.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.549
Wow. Why does that taste so good?

30:43.383 --> 30:44.467
[Bringle] Unless you invented fire,

30:44.551 --> 30:46.761
you didn't invent barbecue
and you don't own it.

30:47.595 --> 30:51.599
I don't have the right
to define what barbecue is.

30:52.141 --> 30:54.936
You know, real barbecue
is whatever you make it.

30:55.645 --> 30:56.771
Belly.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.649
People need to have an open mind.

30:59.732 --> 31:02.402
If you wanna be one of the best,

31:02.485 --> 31:04.237
then you need to be evolving

31:04.320 --> 31:07.115
and understand
that you don't know everything.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.747
[Meehan] Barbecue has become this thing

31:14.831 --> 31:18.751
that the further I waded into the swamp,
the further I wanna go,

31:18.835 --> 31:21.296
because I think
there's that much more to know.

31:21.379 --> 31:25.300
And that's been
a really fascinating, fun part.

31:25.383 --> 31:26.634
The more people I talk to,

31:26.718 --> 31:29.470
the more there is to learn
and then take back home

31:29.554 --> 31:32.599
and try to put into practice
and see what I can make sense out of.

31:35.977 --> 31:39.606
[Tootsie] I was born here in Lexington
and raised in Lexington,

31:39.689 --> 31:44.027
and as a little girl,
barbecue was always a Saturday treat.

31:44.944 --> 31:48.239
So, actually, we're carrying on
the Texas tradition.

31:48.323 --> 31:52.201
Saturday only from 60, 70, 80 years ago.

31:56.748 --> 32:02.462
I work for the Giddings Public School
with maintenance and groundskeeping.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.798
[Meehan] So is this fun
after a long week of work? I mean...

32:05.882 --> 32:08.551
I wouldn't have done it
for 50 years if I didn't enjoy it.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.554
I stay busy.

32:12.138 --> 32:15.850
Getting here at 2:00,
getting the meat on, firing up.

32:16.476 --> 32:19.270
So, between 3:00 and 4:00
is about my slackish time.

32:19.354 --> 32:20.980
That's when you're slacking?

32:21.064 --> 32:22.482
Between 3:00 and 4:00 in the morning?

32:22.565 --> 32:24.108
-In the morning. Mmm-hmm.
-[chuckles]

32:24.692 --> 32:26.986
[Meehan] How often were
women running the pit?

32:27.070 --> 32:28.488
Was that a commonplace thing?

32:28.571 --> 32:33.534
Oh, no. I know of very few ladies
that are pitmasters.

32:33.618 --> 32:37.747
Growing up, it was just the men
back there at the pit.

32:39.415 --> 32:40.875
[Meehan] What is the history

32:40.959 --> 32:43.836
of having this food ready at eight o'clock
in the morning?

32:43.920 --> 32:45.797
Is it from people coming
off of night shifts or--

32:45.880 --> 32:49.300
It wasn't eight o'clock
until the recognition.

32:50.468 --> 32:54.138
Texas Monthly and The New Yorker
came out with great articles.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.224
[Meehan] And then it just snowballs
from there.

32:56.307 --> 33:00.895
[Bexley] Now it's normally 40-something
people at eight o'clock.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.648
[Tootsie] The owner of Texas Monthly came

33:03.731 --> 33:07.402
and told us that we
were number one in Texas.

33:07.485 --> 33:12.323
And all Kerry and I could do
was hold each other and cry. [chuckling]

33:12.407 --> 33:18.121
We never expected anything like that
to happen from old country girl's cooking.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.375
[Meehan] These are local places

33:22.458 --> 33:26.170
where everyday people come and eat lunch
and dinner and feed their families.

33:26.254 --> 33:29.549
And that is the core of what barbecue is.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.511
It's not even a regional business.
It's a local business.

33:34.637 --> 33:37.932
I know in North Carolina
or up in the eastern states,

33:38.016 --> 33:39.976
they have the pulled pork.

33:40.059 --> 33:45.148
For me, here in Lee County in Texas,
I want a nice pretty steak.

33:45.231 --> 33:47.525
I don't want it pulled all apart.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.236
But that's just my personal feeling.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.699
-Thank you. Enjoyed it.
-Thank you.

33:54.782 --> 33:57.368
-Everything was lovely. I'll be back.
-[Tootsie laughing] Okay.

33:57.452 --> 33:58.536
Thank you.

34:00.079 --> 34:03.082
[Tootsie] It's quite an honor.
Uh, I appreciate it.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.959
[clicks tongue] Uh...

34:06.252 --> 34:08.920
A lot of people out there love me,
and I love them.

34:16.262 --> 34:20.016
[Meehan] Barbecue especially is bringing
people together around the table to eat,

34:20.099 --> 34:22.935
and that's where the whole idea
of regionalism goes out,

34:23.018 --> 34:24.896
because there's a generosity

34:24.978 --> 34:27.815
in the fact that you got up
at four o'clock this morning

34:27.899 --> 34:29.650
and drove down here and started a fire
and made us ribs

34:29.734 --> 34:32.445
-and cooked them in your way... and slept.
-[Lang] I slept here.

34:32.527 --> 34:34.489
-I would sleep here, too.
-[laughing]

34:34.572 --> 34:37.784
But going through all of that
and bringing this and serving us

34:37.867 --> 34:42.955
and that experience is the joy of food.

34:43.039 --> 34:46.292
And I think that's where all
of the partisan bickering falls apart.

34:46.375 --> 34:47.376
[Lang] I agree with that.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.470
[Chang] When I was studying
religion in college,

34:57.553 --> 34:59.764
studying a certain kind of Buddhism,

34:59.847 --> 35:03.101
and, uh, the Dalai Lama
basically said, like,

35:03.184 --> 35:07.271
"Hey, if, uh, if science proves
without a shadow of a doubt

35:07.355 --> 35:09.649
that reincarnation isn't possible,

35:09.732 --> 35:11.317
then we would adopt that."

35:12.193 --> 35:14.529
And I was like, "That's fucking crazy."

35:14.612 --> 35:18.533
It's a whole tenet of... [laughing]
for the most part, of Buddhism.

35:18.616 --> 35:21.702
And he's like, "Hey, we'll move on.
We'll accept that."

35:23.746 --> 35:25.832
I think you just have to be
open to things,

35:25.915 --> 35:28.793
because you never know
who's carrying the keys to your castle.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.880
That, to me,
is the fucking most exciting thing,

35:32.964 --> 35:37.260
is when you have this revelation, and
you're like, "Oh, I'm a fucking idiot."

35:37.343 --> 35:38.427
Right?

35:38.511 --> 35:40.680
I think you gotta be open to that.

35:43.808 --> 35:44.642
Hi.

35:46.894 --> 35:48.354
-[Kodama] Konnichiwa.
-Hi. Konnichiwa.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.023
[grunts] Can I...

35:53.901 --> 35:54.819
Hi. [speaks Japanese]

35:54.902 --> 35:56.362
[in English] Really, this is barbecue

35:56.445 --> 36:00.324
in a way that I think most people
outside of Japan don't know.

36:01.200 --> 36:04.328
Can you tell me what's so special
about this charcoal?

36:04.412 --> 36:06.539
[Kodama in Japanese]
This is Japanese binchoutan charcoal.

36:06.622 --> 36:08.749
It's really, really hard.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.711
Dealing with this
is like dealing with a living thing.

36:13.462 --> 36:16.465
The fragrance envelops
the yakitori like this.

36:16.549 --> 36:23.139
Completely different
from regular charcoal.

36:23.222 --> 36:29.312
That's the very life of the fragrance
of the binchoutan charcoal.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.396
[Chang in English]
I don't think people understand

36:30.479 --> 36:35.151
that this is not just your normal charcoal
that you use in your backyard in a grill.

36:35.234 --> 36:38.738
This is extraordinarily expensive,
extraordinarily difficult to make

36:38.821 --> 36:40.239
and really hard to buy.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.367
[in Japanese] It's only because of this
binchoutan charcoal and the ash

36:43.451 --> 36:45.411
that I'm able to cook this yakitori.

36:45.494 --> 36:48.998
[in English] Can you tell me about
the chicken and the produce that you use?

36:49.582 --> 36:53.169
[in Japanese] The bird that I use
is from where I was born, Niigata.

36:53.252 --> 36:55.546
I use Niigata bird.

36:55.630 --> 37:00.676
So I use bird from Niigata
and Niigata salt from the sea.

37:00.760 --> 37:05.223
The flame goes down bit by bit,
then the oil from the yakitori falls

37:05.306 --> 37:07.725
as it's been cooked.

37:08.851 --> 37:11.479
The oil from the bird falls down,

37:11.562 --> 37:18.194
and it's the smoke
that comes up and envelops it,

37:18.277 --> 37:19.946
cooking it that way.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.281
[in English] So, basically the fat,
when it hits the charcoal,

37:22.365 --> 37:26.327
when it smokes and flares up,
that's what gives the tori the flavor.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.580
I hate TV shows that say,

37:29.664 --> 37:31.749
"Oh, I wish there was
Smell-O-Vision in here."

37:31.832 --> 37:34.627
[chuckles softly]
But it's one of those moments

37:34.710 --> 37:40.216
where the chicken fat
in combination with the charcoal,

37:40.299 --> 37:42.343
-it smells like barbecue.
-[speaks in Japanese]

37:43.511 --> 37:44.512
Chicken tail.

37:53.646 --> 37:54.689
[speaks in Japanese]

38:00.111 --> 38:01.988
[in English] Holy shit.

38:02.071 --> 38:04.907
It's so good. You know it's delicious.

38:05.950 --> 38:09.996
[chuckles] This is not just a normal
chicken wing. It's boned out.

38:15.209 --> 38:19.005
It takes a lot of time.
It's not just blindly frying it.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.423
They do the work for you,

38:20.506 --> 38:22.717
so you can just take
a lollipop bite of this.

38:27.555 --> 38:28.764
And I'd say, for myself,

38:28.848 --> 38:31.100
this is one of my favorite things
in the world to eat.

38:32.768 --> 38:35.813
And this is the liver
that's been dipped in tare?

38:40.192 --> 38:41.277
[speaks in Japanese]

38:41.360 --> 38:43.571
[Kodama] I think this is
probably the most delicious.

38:43.654 --> 38:47.700
Eight chickens to make one skewer.

38:48.659 --> 38:50.786
[Chang in English]
This is the best yakitori I've ever had.

38:51.912 --> 38:55.541
I don't give a shit there's a camera crew
right now. I feel very lucky.

38:58.085 --> 39:01.630
[Kodama in Japanese] That's right.
The aroma's really there.

39:01.714 --> 39:04.800
Infusing that aroma is my job.

39:08.512 --> 39:09.930
[Chang in English] Hold on.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.520
Chef, I have to give you a hug.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.230
[laughing]

39:21.192 --> 39:24.820
It's... [stutters] it's unbelievably good.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.824
-Thank you. [chuckles]
-[speaks in Japanese]

39:28.908 --> 39:31.577
[in English] You guys know it.
This is not normal yakitori.

39:31.660 --> 39:32.953
This is unbelievable.

39:35.122 --> 39:38.918
He's a master. Master.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.382
Thank you.

39:50.679 --> 39:51.680
That's the...

39:52.973 --> 39:57.603
I mean, without being totally cliché
and redundant, that's as good as it gets.

39:57.686 --> 39:58.687
And...

39:59.688 --> 40:03.025
I have a hard time understanding
that he's not, like...

40:03.109 --> 40:05.611
In my mind, it's, like, world-class meal.

40:06.695 --> 40:07.780
It really is.

40:07.863 --> 40:09.907
Yes, he's very famous, but it's like...

40:09.990 --> 40:13.077
There should be a fuckin' 300-person queue
out here right now.

40:13.160 --> 40:17.248
The fact is this. You guys are out here.
I'm gonna go back inside.

40:17.331 --> 40:20.709
[stammers] This is the best fucking, uh...

40:21.877 --> 40:26.298
The best compliment I can give is,
while eating it, I'm thinking,

40:26.382 --> 40:29.301
"When can I schedule
to eat here again this week?"

40:29.385 --> 40:30.636
[chuckles]

40:32.888 --> 40:37.143
Everything you do when you take
from other cultures or other ideas,

40:37.226 --> 40:41.647
you have to internalize it
and you have to almost rationalize that,

40:41.730 --> 40:43.524
"This is how I would have done it."

40:43.607 --> 40:46.861
Or, "If this was my idea,
this is what I would've done."

40:48.696 --> 40:52.158
And it's using that as a platform
to do something better.

40:52.241 --> 40:56.454
Sometimes, that "better"
will make it worse. Right?

40:56.537 --> 40:59.707
I'm prone to do that all the time.

41:05.337 --> 41:06.672
[Chang] Playing with fire is fun.

41:08.382 --> 41:13.387
That's essentially all barbecue is to me.
It's fucking grown men playing with fire.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.431
-[Choe] Should I not open this?
-[Lang] Yeah, go ahead.

41:17.725 --> 41:19.435
Oh, my God, dude.

41:21.020 --> 41:22.897
-It tastes like kalbi, though, right?
-[Lang] Yeah.

41:22.980 --> 41:25.024
But that's not ready right now?

41:25.107 --> 41:27.109
-[Chang] Almost. Almost.
-Yeah.

41:27.193 --> 41:29.278
I don't ask you when
your fuckin' paintings are ready.

41:29.361 --> 41:30.571
-Yeah, you do.
-I do, though.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.364
-You ask me all the time.
-You're right.

41:32.448 --> 41:34.116
[laughing]

41:34.200 --> 41:36.035
Choe, why are you wearing that?

41:36.118 --> 41:37.828
I got paint all over my suit.

41:39.079 --> 41:42.208
So I have a jumpsuit with my suit on it.

41:43.042 --> 41:46.295
[Lang] I mean, this end is looking nice,
but this is where you slice from,

41:46.378 --> 41:47.630
and it's not ready.

41:47.713 --> 41:50.716
This little trick
is wrap it in plastic individually

41:50.799 --> 41:52.259
and then put it in the towel.

41:52.343 --> 41:53.719
All right, so let's do that now.

41:53.802 --> 41:56.430
-I'll get the platter, anyway.
-[Lang] Okay. Yeah.

41:56.514 --> 41:57.765
'Cause it'll hold it in.

42:00.601 --> 42:03.354
[Chang] "Make it fucking happen."
That's the name of the game.

42:03.437 --> 42:04.730
You wanna help us pack this meat?

42:04.813 --> 42:06.440
[all laughing]

42:07.525 --> 42:08.776
What's going on here?

42:10.194 --> 42:11.987
Um, it smells like lighter fluid.

42:12.071 --> 42:15.658
The whole, uh, place
is gonna go up like a powder keg.

42:16.242 --> 42:17.159
[Chang] Making kalbi.

42:17.243 --> 42:20.663
It's basically a soy,
pear-marinated short rib

42:20.746 --> 42:22.957
that people eat in Korean
barbecue all the time.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.875
But I've never seen it cooked this way.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.502
People don't wanna mess with Korean food,

42:26.585 --> 42:29.004
and people don't wanna mess
with American barbecue.

42:29.088 --> 42:30.881
-Until today.
-Until today.

42:32.675 --> 42:34.093
[Choe] So this is the new style.

42:34.176 --> 42:35.844
And, what,
my mom's gonna do the traditional?

42:35.928 --> 42:38.514
[Chang] Yeah, your mom's gonna do
traditional Korean barbecue.

42:38.597 --> 42:43.102
-[Choe] Ooh.
-Smells delicious. Very well. [chuckles]

42:43.185 --> 42:45.771
-Finally here.
-[speaks Korean]

42:45.854 --> 42:48.107
[Yeun in English]
Oh, is this a taste-test comparison?

42:48.190 --> 42:49.692
[Choe] I didn't know
we were in a meat-off.

42:49.775 --> 42:52.486
-Is it the same marinades, or are you--
-[Chang] Yeah.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.697
That's basically Mama Chang's marinade.

42:54.780 --> 42:56.365
Just different style.

42:56.448 --> 42:58.492
Dude, you gotta touch it.
It's like meat Jell-O.

42:58.576 --> 43:02.621
-Yo, that looks bonkers.
-[Chang] I'll let the master do it.

43:03.539 --> 43:05.332
[Choe] Mom, you can have the first taste.

43:05.416 --> 43:08.085
-[Yeun] Whoa. Word.
-[Lang] You should eat this.

43:11.046 --> 43:13.007
-I love it. Mmm.
-[Choe] Do you like it?

43:13.090 --> 43:14.300
[Chang] And that's ssamjang.

43:14.383 --> 43:17.720
That's with chickpea
instead of your traditional miso.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.555
I feel like now it's healthy.

43:19.638 --> 43:21.307
-Now that it's been wrapped in leather.
-[all laugh]

43:23.684 --> 43:25.853
[Yeun]
Do you think it tastes Korean, though?

43:25.936 --> 43:27.521
[Chang] How is it not Korean?

43:27.605 --> 43:29.815
It's my mom's recipe.
It's a kalbi marinade.

43:30.691 --> 43:33.068
-I soaked it in for 48 hours.
-Yeah.

43:33.152 --> 43:35.738
-And I cooked it over charcoal.
-[Yeun] Right.

43:35.821 --> 43:37.990
[Chang] How is that not Korean barbecue?

43:38.073 --> 43:39.158
[Jae Ohk Choe] Oh.

43:41.118 --> 43:44.830
There's so many things on the table,
it's hard to keep track of.

43:44.913 --> 43:47.333
Man, we're gonna eat
till we're so unhappy.

43:47.416 --> 43:49.293
-[Jae Ohk Choe laughs]
-[Kimmel] Wow.

43:49.376 --> 43:52.046
-Wow. I like that. That's great.
-[Jae Ohk Choe] Yes.

43:52.129 --> 43:55.507
Koreans must spend a lot of time
washing dishes.

43:55.591 --> 43:56.717
-[laughter]
-[Jae Ohk Choe] I have a dishwasher.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.135
-[Chang] Cheers, guys.
-[all] Cheers.

43:58.218 --> 44:00.346
-Thank you so much.
-[Chang] To barbecue of new and old.

44:00.429 --> 44:02.056
[Jae Ohk Choe] Thank God for everything.

44:02.139 --> 44:03.724
Thank God for everything.

44:03.807 --> 44:05.517
To the white guys. Thank you.

44:05.601 --> 44:06.602
[laughing]

44:06.685 --> 44:10.147
Oh, yeah, Mom, you'd be proud.
Dave, he has a Korean wife.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.440
Steve's got a Korean wife, too.

44:11.523 --> 44:12.650
-[Yeun] Yeah!
-Him, too.

44:12.733 --> 44:13.942
To your Korean wives.

44:14.026 --> 44:15.444
-[Jae Ohk Choe] Yes, yes.
-[Chang] Thank you.

44:15.527 --> 44:17.196
-[Yeun] To our wives.
-To our wives.

44:17.279 --> 44:18.197
Cheers.

44:18.739 --> 44:21.116
-How about your wife?
-She's Korean.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.201
[all laugh]

44:22.284 --> 44:24.787
-I just want to fit in.
