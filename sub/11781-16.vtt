WEBVTT

00:05.873 --> 00:07.475
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.043
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:09.077 --> 00:11.112
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.145 --> 00:12.446
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.482
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.484
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:16.517 --> 00:18.819
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:18.852 --> 00:24.058
Just to be clear.
Are you asking me
on another fake date?

00:24.092 --> 00:27.528
Signups for
the school play
have finally begun.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.098
Looks like
it's you and me, Fadden.
Cindy and Charming.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.132
Guess so.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.535
Ben, where did that
come from?

00:34.568 --> 00:36.470
BEN: She's gonna be
all fun and charming

00:36.504 --> 00:37.838
and then she's
just gonna leave.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.140
I will not let you down.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.375
I would like you to stay.

00:41.409 --> 00:45.613
Forget what I said before.
Ben Quimby is mine,
so back off.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.047
Will you marry me, Kate?

00:51.852 --> 00:54.622
Okay.
Your flight for Paris
leaves in three hours.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.124
And you're all checked in.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.126
Your boarding pass
is in your itinerary.

00:58.159 --> 01:01.095
And your town car is
waiting outside and that
takes care of everything.

01:01.129 --> 01:04.532
Not everything. I've got some
major damage control
to do with Donovan

01:04.565 --> 01:06.834
after the
Jeremy-Harrods debacle.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.103
And with Eli trying
to revamp the collection,

01:09.137 --> 01:11.872
there's something important
I need you to handle
while I'm away.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.107
Of course.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.142
Is it here?

01:14.175 --> 01:15.176
Not until tomorrow.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.877
But it's officially
on Good.ay.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.879
Donovan is good friends
with Nina Garcia.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.581
(GASPS) Nina Garcia
of Project Runway.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.882
Fashion director
at Marie Claire!

01:21.915 --> 01:23.851
Yes. Yes.
As I was saying,

01:23.884 --> 01:26.654
Donovan is designing
a one-of-a-kind
dress for Nina

01:26.687 --> 01:28.122
which is arriving tomorrow.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.523
But Nina hasn't
bought off the rack

01:29.557 --> 01:32.193
since a "Who Wore It Best"
debacle back in 2002.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.195
And Nina
wore it best,
of course, right?

01:34.228 --> 01:36.597
But a close call
is a close call.

01:36.630 --> 01:37.698
And now she's afraid
to be caught dead

01:37.731 --> 01:39.867
wearing the same dress
as someone else ever again.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.136
Nina has an important
event tomorrow night.

01:42.170 --> 01:46.540
I need you
to make sure that
she gets that dress.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.876
No screw ups, understood?

01:48.909 --> 01:50.144
Yes. (WHISPERS) Thank you.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.545
Get the dress.
No screw ups.

01:51.579 --> 01:54.582
I can do it.
Have a safe flight, Gray.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.622
You look like
someone who doesn't
have plans tomorrow night.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.691
That's kind of insulting.

02:03.724 --> 02:07.195
Yeah, that came out
wrong. Sorry. Uh...

02:07.228 --> 02:09.163
You're forgiven.
And also correct.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.664
I do not have plans.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.566
Well, would you like to?

02:12.600 --> 02:16.637
Because I just made
dinner reservations
for our first date.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.572
You did?

02:18.606 --> 02:20.908
Yeah, I figured
Gray's out of town
so why not take a chance.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.243
What do you say?

02:22.276 --> 02:24.178
A risk taker.
I like it.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.213
I'm in.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.680
Good.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.219
Oh, and, uh,
wear something nice.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.187
Again, kind of insulting.

02:33.221 --> 02:36.190
Sorry.
You always look nice.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.226
It's just that we're going
to Le Petit Bordelais.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.961
Wow. That's fancy.
How'd you get us in there?

02:40.994 --> 02:43.664
I'm a very iOh.rtant person.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.233
And my buddy
works in the kitchen.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.167
(CHUCKLES)
Sounds like fun.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.206
It's about time.

02:56.310 --> 03:00.614
* I've my heart where
my head should be

03:00.648 --> 03:03.651
* Light up the rest of me

03:03.684 --> 03:07.221
* 'Cause your dreams,
they won't fall apart

03:07.255 --> 03:09.257
* Through the stops,
the starts

03:09.290 --> 03:12.192
* And life is a work of art

03:14.995 --> 03:16.264
(SNORING)

03:25.706 --> 03:27.308
(BEN MUMBLING)

03:39.820 --> 03:42.323
JANE: I'm in here.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.724
Hurry up. We got to go.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.796
So, what do you think?

03:48.829 --> 03:51.265
You look amazing.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.766
RYeah.?

03:52.800 --> 03:54.034
New dress?

03:54.067 --> 03:56.804
Yes, I have been
working on it for weeks.

03:56.837 --> 04:00.708
And now I finally
have the perfect
place to wear it.

04:00.741 --> 04:04.678
It's a little fancy for the
halls of Whitemarsh High,
don't you think?

04:04.712 --> 04:07.247
No, silly. I...

04:08.081 --> 04:09.317
I have a date tonight.

04:10.318 --> 04:13.754
Oh. So that...

04:13.787 --> 04:16.290
That Eli guy
must have finally
asked you out then, huh?

04:16.824 --> 04:18.426
Yeah.

04:18.459 --> 04:22.763
And he's taking me
to, like, one of the fanciest
restaurants in New York. So...

04:22.796 --> 04:23.964
I just really
hope he likes it.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.334
I'm gonna go
out on a limb here
and say that he will.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.338
Can you help unhook me?

04:30.371 --> 04:31.805
Oh. Yeah.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.047
By the way...

04:40.080 --> 04:42.049
Why is Ben sleeping
on the couch?

04:42.082 --> 04:46.086
Oh, well,
ever since Dakota
proposed to my mom,

04:46.119 --> 04:48.789
he's been
camped out here
waiting for an answer

04:48.822 --> 04:51.359
and they've taken over
Ben's room in the meantime.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.860
Do you think
she's gonna say yes?

04:52.893 --> 04:54.328
She said
she'll think about it.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.364
Ouch. That's got to hurt.

04:56.397 --> 04:59.367
I mean,
things must be pretty icy
between them right now, huh?

05:00.434 --> 05:01.835
(BOTH LAUGHING)

05:03.136 --> 05:05.305
Oh! Morning, darlings!

05:07.140 --> 05:08.442
(CLEARS THROAT)

05:10.911 --> 05:12.346
How long is this
gonna go on?

05:12.380 --> 05:13.881
Probably until
he gets an answer.

05:13.914 --> 05:14.915
(GIGGLES)

05:15.783 --> 05:17.084
Seriously?

05:17.117 --> 05:19.420
Do you mind
if Dakota and I take
a shower before you, honey?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.855
Only if you promise
to stop talking about it.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.391
(CHUCKLING)

05:25.893 --> 05:27.895
You should probably
get ready for school.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.763
I can't go
into my room.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.799
Better you than me.
See you later.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.106
Hey.
Can I show you something?

05:39.139 --> 05:40.107
I'm kind of busy.

05:40.140 --> 05:43.110
I'm not.
I framed my
yearbook photo for Ben,

05:43.143 --> 05:45.379
and I just
wanted your thoughts.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.915
Be honest. (CHUCKLES)

05:47.948 --> 05:50.951
And I got
your yearbook photo
framed for him, too.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.487
Why would you do that?

05:53.521 --> 05:56.424
Oh, just so he knows
what he's getting,
and what he's dodging.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.125
(CHUCKLES) No offense.

05:58.158 --> 06:01.929
Look. This whole
competing for a guy
thing between us,

06:01.962 --> 06:03.931
it's all getting
a bit high school.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.967
Well, duh.
We're in high school, Jaw.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.804
You're right.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.406
We are.
And just like
back in high school,

06:12.440 --> 06:15.175
you win!
Congratulations, Amanda.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.445
So, Ben is...

06:18.479 --> 06:20.147
All yours, Amanda.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.949
I knew that it was
only a matter of time,

06:21.982 --> 06:24.184
but I have to say
that your concession

06:24.217 --> 06:26.987
is both honorable
and really humbling.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.493
Guess I don't
need this now, right?
(CHUCKLING)

06:32.526 --> 06:34.462
Here you go.
I'll just leave it there.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.929
Little memento for you.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.842
Should I even ask?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.210
That's completely up to you.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.980
Okay. What is with
the yoga ball?

06:53.013 --> 06:57.017
(GROANS) Our couch
is destroying my spine.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.020
I'm sorry they
took your bed.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.190
Hopefully
it'll be over soon.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.993
She just has to
give him an answer.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.194
Then we'll be done with it.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.161
What do you mean?

07:08.195 --> 07:11.999
I mean,
if she says no,
then he'll leave.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.201
If she says yes,
then they'll both leave.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.537
Win-win. Either way,
I get my bed back.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.438
Do you think
she'll say yes?

07:19.039 --> 07:20.474
I don't know.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.544
Ben, I don't
want her to leave.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.047
I don't want her
to disappear again.

07:35.523 --> 07:38.025
I don't want her to
disappear again either.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.560
I thought you
wanted her to go.

07:39.593 --> 07:42.496
I do. And then I don't.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.932
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.934
I(SIGHS)..

07:48.035 --> 07:50.504
It's easier to
push someone away first

07:50.538 --> 07:52.239
before they can
push you away.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.575
Keeping Mom
at arm's length,
that's my way of

07:55.943 --> 07:57.477
protecting you.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.514
And myself.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.983
So you think
she's gonna leave?

08:03.016 --> 08:05.586
Actually, I don't.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.288
I got to be honest,

08:08.321 --> 08:12.526
I'm starting to think
things might be
different this time.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.061
She seems better.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.063
Really?

08:17.030 --> 08:18.532
Really.

08:44.592 --> 08:45.626
(CHUCKLING)

08:45.659 --> 08:47.294
What?

08:47.327 --> 08:50.698
I just cannot get used
to you volunteering
for the drama club.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.100
Well, then that
makes two of us.

08:53.133 --> 08:56.570
But Zoe said
it would give us
more time to hang out.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.572
And how's that
working out?

08:58.606 --> 09:00.708
Honestly, I kind of
feel like a stalker.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.644
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

09:03.677 --> 09:06.580
What about you?
How are the costumes
coming along?

09:06.614 --> 09:08.716
Well, funny enough,
my mom signed us up

09:08.749 --> 09:10.718
so that we could
spend more time together.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.586
And how's that one
working out for you?

09:12.620 --> 09:15.355
Well,
she usually sleeps in late,
rolls in about 11.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.591
And I have to leave
for work at 11:30.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.760
But that half hour
is really something.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.596
All right, so what's
the deal with the dress?

09:22.630 --> 09:23.563
I had to
bring it to school

09:23.597 --> 09:24.431
because I don't have
enough time to go home

09:24.464 --> 09:27.735
and change after work
before my date.

09:27.768 --> 09:31.138
Would you look at that?

09:31.171 --> 09:32.372
At what?

09:32.405 --> 09:33.707
Hot and hotter.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.377
Nothing? Please.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.346
Oh, here we go, guys.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.782
Just wait for it.
Here it comes.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.719
Now that is a kiss.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.622
Oh, my gosh.
You can't fake
chemistry like that.

09:48.656 --> 09:49.757
It's just acting.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.625
Trust me.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.827
Chemistry on stage
is chemistry off stage.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.763
These two?

09:55.796 --> 09:58.632
Gonna be Whitemarsh's
very own Brangelina
by next week.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.673
Hey, it really is nothing.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.817
Oh, hi, Mom.
You're here already?

10:16.850 --> 10:19.186
Yeah, I had to
get out of the house.

10:19.219 --> 10:22.756
All that love is
a little much sometimes,
you know what I mean?

10:22.790 --> 10:24.191
I guess so.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.693
Oh, thank goodness
you're here.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.728
This waistband
is kind of a mess.

10:27.761 --> 10:28.829
Oh. Here, let me.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.835
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

10:34.868 --> 10:37.671
My girl. So talented.

10:37.705 --> 10:38.872
Thanks, Mom.

10:38.906 --> 10:43.677
So have you
given any thought
to Dakota's proposal?

10:43.711 --> 10:46.646
Oh. I try not to
give too much thought
to that sort of thing.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.717
Forever is a long time.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.686
But you guys seem happy.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.688
He seems like
a really good guy.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.857
He is the best.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.793
So, if you were
to say yes,

10:59.827 --> 11:01.729
hypothetically, of course,

11:01.762 --> 11:04.231
that would mean
you're moving back
to Colorado, right?

11:04.264 --> 11:07.701
Like I said,
I haven't given it
a lot of thought.

11:07.735 --> 11:10.838
Besides, I've been
too swamped designing

11:10.871 --> 11:14.241
all of these costumes to
think about anything else.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.843
I'm sorry.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.845
I know
I've been too busy
to help you lately.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.847
It's okay.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.716
I did hope we could
do this together.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.752
I promise I will
be around more.

11:25.753 --> 11:26.820
Thanks, baby.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.824
That is, if you
are still here.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.497
STSteve!o!

11:37.530 --> 11:40.500
Hey. I didn't know
you were dropping by today.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.903
I guess you heard about
Nick Fadden's shoulder.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.272
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
And it's a shame.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.741
But I'm not here to
talk about Nick Fadden.

11:47.775 --> 11:50.510
New York's Double-A club
lost their closer this week.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.779
He got the call.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.280
The majors?

11:53.313 --> 11:55.883
Good for you.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.751
What are you
talking about?

11:57.785 --> 11:59.820
I'm talking about
that pitch you threw
a few weeks ago.

11:59.853 --> 12:00.888
Come here.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.525
You know how fast
that pitch was?

12:05.558 --> 12:06.794
No.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.829
Fast enough to
get you a try out.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.764
(LAUGHS) A what?

12:10.998 --> 12:13.767
Come on, Steve!

12:13.801 --> 12:15.769
I can't just
drop everything.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.905
Nobody asked you to
just drop everything.

12:17.938 --> 12:21.508
This is just a try out.
Today. One hour. That's it.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.911
Now the "dropping
everything" part,

12:23.944 --> 12:25.846
that happens
after the tryouts.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.547
You know I take
care of my sister.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.918
I know, I know.
And I admire that.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.787
But, if things
were to work out

12:33.821 --> 12:35.823
I was hoping there
might be someone who
could take care of her.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.024
Just for a little while.

12:38.826 --> 12:39.960
Is there?

12:40.828 --> 12:42.029
A relative?

12:42.930 --> 12:44.998
Ben.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.000
This could be
your second chance.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.843
Hello, Ben.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.946
Amanda.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.948
What is all this?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.816
Hmm.
It's a little mood lighting.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.952
Okay.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.955
Ben,
you're killing the mood.

13:07.988 --> 13:11.859
That would be because
I'm trying to kill the mood.

13:12.860 --> 13:13.827
I'm...

13:13.861 --> 13:15.963
I've kind of got a lot
on my mind right now.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.965
Well, maybe later on?

13:17.998 --> 13:20.000
How about tonight?
You, me, my place?

13:20.033 --> 13:21.969
I'll bring the
coconut sandalwood.

13:22.970 --> 13:26.039
Look, I am flattered

13:26.073 --> 13:29.977
that you've created
this fire hazard for me,

13:30.010 --> 13:32.980
and back in high school
this would have...

13:33.013 --> 13:36.616
Okay, it was a total
fantasy of mine.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.052
Okay, yeah,
I like where
this is going.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.988
But the truth is

13:41.955 --> 13:43.991
I'm not over Rita.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.593
You're not over
Shaw the Jaw?

13:46.626 --> 13:48.896
No. I'm not.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.899
And Amanda...

13:52.665 --> 13:53.901
Don't call her that again.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.071
(CHUCKLING)

14:00.007 --> 14:01.942
WhaNothing.g?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.043
Billy.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.978
It's nothing, okay, Jane?

14:05.012 --> 14:05.879
It was the kiss.

14:05.913 --> 14:08.882
Nope, don't care.
It was no big deal.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.083
Seriously?

14:10.117 --> 14:13.020
This is me here,
Jane Quimby,

14:13.053 --> 14:14.955
best friend
since kindergarten.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.924
You really
think you're gonna
get away with that?

14:16.957 --> 14:20.060
Fine. It bugs me, okay?
And I hate that it does,

14:20.093 --> 14:22.029
but seeing
Zoe and Nick
kiss like that,

14:22.062 --> 14:24.998
it just brings
back the whole
Nick and Lulu thing.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.900
And I know
it's ridiculous, but...

14:26.934 --> 14:29.970
Hey. Your feelings
are not ridiculous.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.072
Besides,

14:32.105 --> 14:35.042
this is different.
Zoe is different.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.010
AnPlease...

14:37.044 --> 14:38.979
Please don't say
it's just acting.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.080
INo.s.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.983
No, it's not, okay?

14:43.016 --> 14:46.920
Zoe and Nick have chemistry.
You and I both saw it.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.688
I'm telling you
there's nothing
going on with them.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.722
They are just friends.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.127
Guys and girls
can be just friends,
you know,

14:54.161 --> 14:57.130
without it automatically
leading to some deep,
dark romance.

14:57.164 --> 14:59.066
Yeah, whatever.

14:59.099 --> 15:02.669
Well, what about us?
We're just friends.
You said so yourself.

15:02.702 --> 15:05.072
Why is it different?

15:05.105 --> 15:10.077
Because you're not
like a girl-girl.
You're just...

15:10.110 --> 15:11.711
I'm just what?

15:11.744 --> 15:12.980
You're just Jane.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.983
Thanks a lot.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.519
I have to go to work.

15:21.188 --> 15:24.057
Jane, I didn't
mean it like that.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.539
What happened here?

15:40.173 --> 15:42.042
Amanda.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.144
Well, she certainly
moved fast, didn't she?

15:44.177 --> 15:47.080
Hey, Rita.
You ever think about
second chances?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.117
What do you mean?

15:50.150 --> 15:52.986
I've got a second
chance at something.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.221
Something I've

15:55.155 --> 15:56.189
always wanted.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.192
Clearly.

15:59.226 --> 16:02.529
Look, I had my chance
back in high school,

16:02.562 --> 16:04.764
but it didn't happen for me.
Not in the way I'd hoped.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.135
Life got in the way.
But now it's an option again.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.071
And I've just wanted
this for so long

16:11.104 --> 16:13.140
so I'm excited, obviously.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.175
It could be so much fun

16:15.208 --> 16:18.211
but I'm nervous
at the same time 'cause,
you know, I'm not...

16:19.579 --> 16:22.115
I'm not a teenager anymore.
What if I...

16:23.183 --> 16:26.053
What if I can't perform
like I used to?

16:28.155 --> 16:30.557
You know what, Ben?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.759
If that's what
you want to do,
just do it.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.227
Don't ask for my permission.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.597
(DOUh...AMS)

16:41.234 --> 16:43.203
So are you
ready for tonight?

16:43.236 --> 16:46.039
Yeah.
Got my shoes shined.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.174
Really?

16:47.207 --> 16:49.042
(CHUCKLES) No.

16:49.076 --> 16:52.112
But I did call and confirm
our reservation three times.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.780
I think I'm starting
to annoy them.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.149
You? Annoy?
I can't picture it.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.785
Look, I'm just
a little bit excited, okay?

16:58.818 --> 17:02.122
It's our first date
and it's Le Petit Bordelais.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.791
Well, I'm excited, too.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.193
And I have
something new to wear.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.828
Details, please.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.064
It is the perfect dress.

17:11.098 --> 17:14.301
It's fun and it's fancy

17:15.235 --> 17:17.204
and it's... (GASPS)

17:18.171 --> 17:20.840
I'm sorry?

17:20.873 --> 17:22.642
Um, nothing.
I've got to call you back.

17:24.177 --> 17:26.246
Oh, no, no, no.
Has anybody seen

17:27.147 --> 17:28.281
my...

17:29.282 --> 17:31.118
...dress?

17:49.369 --> 17:51.238
Oh, Jane!

17:51.271 --> 17:54.307
Doesn't Cinderella
look amazing?

17:54.341 --> 17:56.376
Yes, she does, but...

17:56.409 --> 17:58.278
I had to take it
up a few inches.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.512
Inches?

17:59.546 --> 18:02.415
But other than that,
the dress was
absolutely perfect.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.384
It was, wasn't it?

18:04.417 --> 18:07.287
Oh, you really
had me fooled, kiddo.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.688
Acting like you were
too busy to help

18:08.721 --> 18:13.226
while you worked on this
gorgeous Cinderella
costume all by yourself.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.528
And just to surprise me.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.365
Oh, to think that you
would do that for me,

18:18.398 --> 18:21.268
it just means so much.
Thank you, Jane.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.271
You're welcome, Mom.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.205
Oh, well...

18:29.276 --> 18:31.411
Ben! Ben.
Glad you made it.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.546
Hey, like you said,
it's just a try out, right?

18:33.580 --> 18:36.316
Exactly.
So how are you feeling?

18:36.349 --> 18:39.286
Actually,
I'm feeling pretty...

18:41.288 --> 18:42.422
Old, suddenly.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.291
(CHUCKLES) Well, don't.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.559
As long as you're
comfortable on the mound,
that's what counts.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.296
How many guys
trying out for the spot?

18:49.329 --> 18:50.297
Eight.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.532
Oh. Okay. So I shouldn't
be too nervous, right?

18:52.565 --> 18:55.302
I would be.
There's a lot
on the line here.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.304
I'm just saying
my chances are pretty slim.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.506
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
You know what? You're right.

18:59.539 --> 19:02.375
Why even try?
You should probably
just go back home.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.444
I just don't want
to get my hopes
up for nothing.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.447
Ben. You're here
because I think you
got a real shot.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.449
So just go on out there,
meet some of the guys,

19:09.482 --> 19:12.352
throw a few pitches
and whatever happens, happens.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.360
What's this?

19:21.428 --> 19:24.364
Hmm. Gold.

19:24.397 --> 19:27.434
They're rewrites.
And I need you to know them
all by heart, by tomorrow.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.303
I can't help
when inspiration strikes.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.804
It just does. It's a gift.

19:31.838 --> 19:35.308
That's great, but do you
think that your inspiration
could hit tomorrow?

19:35.342 --> 19:37.477
Yeah, I'm starting
to fall behind
on my homework.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.545
AMANDA: Okay.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.347
Listen, people.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.350
Do you think that
anybody made it big
in Hollywood

19:43.383 --> 19:46.319
by actually
doing their homework?

19:46.353 --> 19:47.387
Probably.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.488
Well, I didn't.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.656
Did you make it
in Hollywood?

19:51.424 --> 19:52.459
Just learn those lines.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.396
(SIGHS)

20:04.371 --> 20:05.438
Hi.

20:05.472 --> 20:06.673
WhatNothing.you?

20:08.541 --> 20:11.511
Okay, so I had,
past tense, mind you,

20:11.544 --> 20:13.446
the perfect dress
that I made

20:13.480 --> 20:15.448
to wear on my date
with Eli tonight, and I...

20:15.482 --> 20:17.584
Oh, gosh.
Please don't tell Gray.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.519
It's just new
and I don't
want to jinx it yet.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.020
My lips are sealed.

20:21.053 --> 20:24.391
So, what happened to
this perfect dress of yours
that's got you all sad?

20:24.424 --> 20:26.426
It's gone. Don't ask.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.560
Well, now what
are you gonna wear?

20:27.594 --> 20:31.531
Well, I was thinking
I could wear this.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.634
Yeah. Um...

20:34.667 --> 20:36.469
It looks very...

20:36.503 --> 20:37.504
Please don't say...

20:37.537 --> 20:39.539
Nice.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.408
You know what?
You'll be fine.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.543
Okay? You, Jane,
you look great in anything.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.445
Thanks, Carter.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.381
Now, are you ready
for a little "perfect
dress" pick me up?

20:48.415 --> 20:49.416
So ready.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.452
This just arrived today.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.487
You and I are the
very first people to see it.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.589
It's so beautiful.
Is that for me?

20:56.623 --> 20:58.625
N(WHIMPERS).

20:58.658 --> 21:01.661
Now, you'll be
handing it off to her
assistant in a few minutes.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.463
Don't touch.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.574
Hi. How's the
scenery coming?

21:14.607 --> 21:17.444
Great. Yeah.
Oh, and can I just say

21:17.477 --> 21:20.480
it's been awesome spending
so much time with you.

21:20.513 --> 21:21.648
I'm sorry.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.683
This whole acting thing's
kind of taken over my life.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.453
That's okay.
What do you say
we get out of here,

21:26.486 --> 21:28.555
do something fun tonight?
Just you and me?

21:28.588 --> 21:29.656
(SIGHS)
I can't tonight.

21:30.557 --> 21:31.591
It's okay.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.662
SRight. Tomorrow.

21:38.698 --> 21:41.468
Looks like it's
just you and me, baby.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.479
Amanda!
Just the person
I was looking for.

21:52.512 --> 21:53.613
Hello, Jenkins.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.714
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

21:54.747 --> 21:57.484
And let me
preface this by saying

21:57.517 --> 21:58.751
this really isn't about you.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.720
There've been some
last minute budget cuts

22:00.753 --> 22:03.690
and, unfortunately,
the new position
of drama teacher

22:03.723 --> 22:05.658
is now on the
chopping block.

22:05.692 --> 22:08.561
Oh, wait.
I didn't know Whitemarsh was
hiring another drama teacher.

22:08.595 --> 22:11.531
We aren't.
I'm talking about you.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.466
But you just
said that you weren't.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.503
What I meant was,
this isn't your fault.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.505
But, unfortunately,
your job is in jeopardy.

22:18.538 --> 22:21.574
I, of course,
have lobbied heavily
to keep you on,

22:21.608 --> 22:23.510
but the vote
has to be unanimous.

22:23.543 --> 22:24.511
And why is
that a problem?

22:24.544 --> 22:26.579
Well, there's one person
on the budget committee

22:26.613 --> 22:28.581
whose mind I just
can't seem to change.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.783
(CHUCKLES) Just one?
That's so easy. Who is it?

22:37.557 --> 22:40.693
If you can
win over Rita Shaw,
you get to keep your job.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.695
GoodThank you.nda.

22:42.729 --> 22:43.763
(CHUCKLES)

22:43.796 --> 22:45.532
(GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)

22:48.735 --> 22:50.770
Donovan has
outdone himself again.

22:50.803 --> 22:51.804
I thought so, too.

22:53.840 --> 22:57.544
Wait. What is this?

22:57.577 --> 23:00.547
That is the
back up dress.

23:00.580 --> 23:03.550
Donovan always makes
two of every custom dress
he designs for Nina.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.518
I don't know.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.687
In case something
tragic were to happen.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.690
Well, I should probably
get this over to Nina.
You can keep that one.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.560
In the 10 years
Donovan has been
designing Nina's dresses,

23:13.593 --> 23:15.562
she has never
needed the backup.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.597
Not once.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.532
But, you have to take it.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.634
What if something
tragic were to happen
to the dress?

23:21.668 --> 23:22.635
Trust me. It won't.

23:22.669 --> 23:25.738
Look. Jane. If it
makes you feel any better,

23:25.772 --> 23:28.675
give me your cell number.
I'll give it to Nina. Okay?

23:29.776 --> 23:31.744
Okay. II do. insist.

23:31.778 --> 23:34.581
And if I were you, Jane,
I wouldn't wait by the phone.

23:38.618 --> 23:41.754
The real tragedy is
letting such a beautiful
dress go to waste.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.605
Wow, look at this place.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.540
I can't stop
looking at you.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.476
You weren't kidding,
were you?

24:03.510 --> 24:05.578
That is the
absolute perfect dress.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.247
I feel a little
under-dressed now.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.049
I think you
look pretty perfect.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.486
Can I tell you something?

24:13.520 --> 24:14.621
Sure.

24:18.057 --> 24:19.626
I, uh...

24:19.659 --> 24:21.594
I feel like
we're playing grown up.

24:21.628 --> 24:22.695
Me, too.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.534
I kind of like it.

24:28.635 --> 24:31.037
Did I mention how beautiful
you look in that dress?

24:31.070 --> 24:32.539
Yes, you did.

24:32.572 --> 24:33.673
Do you mind
if I tell you again?

24:40.580 --> 24:43.516
Amanda?
Please, have a seat.

24:43.550 --> 24:46.052
I've come to
bury the hatchet.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.521
So I've been doing
a lot of thinking...

24:48.555 --> 24:51.057
Can't wait to hear this.

24:51.090 --> 24:54.661
The brightest stars
burn out the fastest.

24:54.694 --> 24:57.530
Huh. I think they've
already got that one down.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.632
There is no denying
that Ben and I

24:59.666 --> 25:02.301
would have had a fiery,
(CHUCKLES)

25:02.334 --> 25:04.070
whirlwind relationship.

25:04.103 --> 25:07.073
Just raw,
unbridled passion.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.675
Are we still
burying the hatchet?

25:09.709 --> 25:12.679
What I am
trying to say is that

25:12.712 --> 25:14.681
Ben and I,
we wouldn't last.

25:14.714 --> 25:17.550
Our star would
burn out too quickly.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.652
But you and Ben,
on the other hand,

25:19.686 --> 25:22.589
your star could
burn on forever.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.557
Okay.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.559
You and Ben
are soul mates.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.661
And try as I might,
I just...

25:28.695 --> 25:30.663
I can't get in
the way of that.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.599
You think we're soul mates?

25:32.632 --> 25:34.567
Yes, I do.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.703
And you can't let
that get away from you.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.605
Do you want Ben back?

25:39.739 --> 25:40.573
Yes.

25:40.607 --> 25:43.309
Then you have to
tell him how you feel.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.712
You need to claim your man.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.314
I don't think I can.

25:48.347 --> 25:49.381
Ugh. Why not?

25:49.415 --> 25:52.351
Because what if I tell Ben
that I still like him,

25:52.384 --> 25:54.721
and he says he's
not interested anymore?

25:54.754 --> 25:58.625
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

25:58.658 --> 26:01.628
Do it, Rita.
Do it. Before it's too late.

26:04.764 --> 26:07.734
You know what?
I think I will.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.738
Amanda, I don't
know what to say.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.606
Thank you for this.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.642
You are so welcome.

26:15.675 --> 26:17.810
I'm sure you'll return
the favor one day.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.179
Won't you?

26:20.680 --> 26:22.615
Sure.

26:22.649 --> 26:25.785
Good.
Then my work here is done.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.660
(PLAYING ROMANTIC TUNE)

26:37.196 --> 26:38.765
Make How?top.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.633
I don't know,
maybe tip him?

26:40.667 --> 26:42.802
Or no, don't tip him.
'Cause that could send
the wrong message.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.672
Uh...

26:45.705 --> 26:47.640
Thank you,
but we can't hear...

26:47.674 --> 26:49.742
Oh, for Pete's sake.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.177
MAN: Nina, I'm so glad
you're here.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.780
No! No! No, no, no!

26:59.418 --> 27:00.820
You really don't beat
around the bush, do you?

27:00.853 --> 27:01.854
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

27:08.227 --> 27:10.396
You need a hand there?

27:10.429 --> 27:13.800
Dakota?
I asked you to wait
back at the house.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.668
Yeah, seven hours ago.

27:15.702 --> 27:18.204
I figured if I was gonna
see you I should
come to you instead.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.707
Little busy right now.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.742
OhPlease, don't...

27:22.775 --> 27:24.210
You and I...

27:24.243 --> 27:27.246
Can we just talk
about this later? Please?

27:28.748 --> 27:29.816
No.

27:31.818 --> 27:33.853
I need an answer.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.822
This isn't a good time.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.824
It's never a good
time with you, Kate.
There's always something.

27:37.857 --> 27:41.728
There's always some excuse
to put things off
and avoid commitment.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.831
It's what you do.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.701
That's not fair.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.870
Maybe not.
But it's true.

27:52.772 --> 27:54.273
I love you.

27:56.776 --> 27:57.877
But I need an answer.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.281
Today.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.760
Yeah, they're playing
at the Bowery next month.

28:13.793 --> 28:15.795
I thought we'd
go chUh-huh. out.

28:15.828 --> 28:19.866
And the week after that
they're gonna be playing
on the moon.

28:19.899 --> 28:23.469
We'd have to take a
space shuttle to get there.
How does that sound?

28:23.502 --> 28:25.738
Might be
a little difficult
to get tickets though.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.741
Yeah, we could do that.

28:28.775 --> 28:29.809
Jane, are you okay?

28:29.842 --> 28:30.943
What? No.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.813
Uh, yes. I'm sorry?

28:37.884 --> 28:40.887
Uh, I usually like
to put mine on my lap,

28:40.920 --> 28:42.521
but okay.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.857
Oh, I just don't want
to spill on my dress.

28:45.792 --> 28:46.859
Spill what?

28:56.535 --> 28:57.837
Hi.

28:57.870 --> 28:58.938
Hi.

28:59.839 --> 29:02.775
So, what's going on?

29:02.809 --> 29:04.543
Oh, you know,
I just...
I wanted to

29:04.576 --> 29:07.513
stop playing grown up
and escape the world
up there for a minute.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.916
That's not true.

29:09.949 --> 29:13.886
This isn't my dress.
This is Nina Garcia's
backup dress.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.322
And when her assistant
said that she didn't need it

29:16.355 --> 29:18.891
I thought, "Well,
what could it hurt
to wear it?"

29:18.925 --> 29:20.927
So, what's the problem?

29:20.960 --> 29:24.797
The problem is
Nina just walked in here
wearing the exact same dress.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.866
A dress
that's supposed to
be one of a kind.

29:26.899 --> 29:27.967
Ouch.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.902
I know. I'm sorry.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.838
I just...
I don't know what to do.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.773
I think I have an idea.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.852
(GASPS)

30:07.273 --> 30:09.275
Oh, please
let this night end.

30:09.876 --> 30:11.277
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

30:15.281 --> 30:16.315
Hello?

30:16.348 --> 30:18.284
Is this Jane?
It's Nina Garcia.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.287
Oh. Hi. How are you?

30:21.320 --> 30:24.356
Believe it or not,
I'm going to need
that backup dress.

30:24.390 --> 30:27.860
How quickly can you
meet me in the bathroom
at Le Petit Bordelais?

30:27.894 --> 30:29.328
Hmm. Pretty quickly.

30:29.361 --> 30:30.362
Good.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.378
You must be Jane.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.414
You certainly made it here
very quickly.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.249
What can I say?

30:50.282 --> 30:51.417
Your backup dress.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.386
Thank you.
I must say, I'm impressed.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.856
I'll be sure to tell
Gray how helpful you've been.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.441
I don't know.
It's like you just showed up

31:15.474 --> 31:17.276
out of nowhere.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.311
I didn't expect to have
these feelings for you.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.947
I didn't either.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.449
How're we going
to tell him?

31:23.482 --> 31:26.318
I don't know.
But we have to.

31:26.352 --> 31:28.320
I feel bad, but, I mean,

31:28.354 --> 31:29.922
you can't help who you
fall in love with, right?

31:31.357 --> 31:32.558
Of course not.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.660
But there are
a few things that
you don't know about me.

31:34.693 --> 31:37.296
And if anyone were to
ever found out, I...

31:37.329 --> 31:39.398
(CLEARS THROAT) Too late!

31:39.431 --> 31:40.933
Oh, hey, Billy.
What's going on?

31:40.967 --> 31:41.934
Backstabbing.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.335
What are you talking about?

31:43.369 --> 31:45.337
Oh, come on.
Save the performance, Zoe.

31:45.371 --> 31:46.272
All right.
I heard everything.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.374
Dude, there are 200 girls
at this school.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.409
Why do you keep having
to going after mine?

31:50.442 --> 31:53.345
Okay, Billy, I think
you have this all wrong.

31:53.379 --> 31:54.947
Man, what a colossal

31:54.981 --> 31:56.915
waste of time
you turned out to be, Zoe.

31:58.350 --> 32:01.353
Dude. We were
just running lines.

32:01.387 --> 32:04.490
Ms. Clark, she made
some last minute
revisions to the script.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.392
Check it out.

32:11.363 --> 32:12.698
Ah!

32:12.731 --> 32:14.366
I am a total jerk.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.502
And, apparently,
I'm a colossal
waste of time.

32:19.405 --> 32:20.539
I should probably, um...

32:23.475 --> 32:24.977
Yeah. I'm gonna go. Uh...

32:25.011 --> 32:28.414
Zoe, we'll just finish
runningZOE: Okay.orrow.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.420
I'm so sorry.
I just thought...

32:34.453 --> 32:36.422
Yeah. I know
what you thought.

32:42.428 --> 32:45.531
Zoe?
Please, can we just talk?

32:45.564 --> 32:49.368
You mean,
talk about the fact
that you don't trust me?

32:49.401 --> 32:50.536
No, thanks.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.511
Jane, you're a life saver.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.580
I'm so glad
I could help.

33:03.049 --> 33:05.517
And by the way,
I love what you're wearing.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.389
Everything good now?

33:10.422 --> 33:13.559
Yes. Except I totally
ruined our date.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.427
Now, what do you say
we get out of here

33:15.461 --> 33:17.463
and go somewhere
a little less grown up?

33:17.496 --> 33:19.031
I'd like that.

33:24.803 --> 33:27.039
That's the story
you're sticking with?

33:27.073 --> 33:27.839
Absolutely.

33:27.873 --> 33:30.576
This was a
successful first date?

33:30.609 --> 33:31.610
Yeah.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.579
Really?

33:33.612 --> 33:34.613
Yeah.

33:35.547 --> 33:36.582
Oh!

33:36.615 --> 33:38.517
Darn it!
I'm never gonna be able

33:38.550 --> 33:40.619
to wear
this tablecloth again.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.523
Can I tell you a secret?

33:44.556 --> 33:45.591
Sure.

33:47.626 --> 33:50.496
It's the best first date
I've ever gone on.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.530
Really?

33:51.563 --> 33:52.598
Yeah.

34:19.658 --> 34:20.826
Please, don't do this.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.628
I told you,
I need an answer.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.530
(DOOR OPENING)

34:25.897 --> 34:27.533
What's going on?

34:27.566 --> 34:29.835
Well, it looks like
I'm heading back
to Colorado, Jane.

34:29.868 --> 34:31.503
Um...

34:31.537 --> 34:33.105
It was really nice
to meet you.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.473
And your brother.

34:34.506 --> 34:38.177
And I hope that we get to
spend more time together
in the future.

34:40.579 --> 34:41.847
My offer stands, Kate.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.882
The plane leaves
in two hours.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.118
And if your answer's yes,

34:46.152 --> 34:48.620
there's a ticket
waiting for you.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.589
But, if you don't show up,

34:52.158 --> 34:54.126
well, then I'll know
your answer.

35:03.669 --> 35:04.703
Mom, are you okay?

35:19.585 --> 35:20.586
Mom?

35:20.619 --> 35:22.654
Not now, honey.
I'm busy.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.556
But, what are you
gonna do?

35:24.590 --> 35:28.627
Oh, I totally botched
the sleeve on this costume.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.662
I'm trying to fix it,
but it doesn't matter
what I do,

35:30.696 --> 35:32.564
it just doesn't look right.

35:32.598 --> 35:33.665
I just...

35:33.699 --> 35:35.567
I don't know what to do.

35:35.601 --> 35:36.702
Here, let me look at it.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.604
No. Leave it.

35:39.238 --> 35:40.572
Mom...

35:40.606 --> 35:43.242
What's the point?
I failed. Again.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.711
That's not true.

35:45.744 --> 35:46.945
No, it is.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.715
The only decent costume
in the whole play

35:49.748 --> 35:52.651
is the dress that you made
for Cinderella.

35:52.684 --> 35:55.587
That's because
I had months
to work on it.

35:55.621 --> 35:56.588
What? Months?

35:56.622 --> 35:58.590
We've only been doing
costumes for a few days.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.592
Yeah...

36:00.626 --> 36:03.262
The thing is,
I didn't really make
that dress for the play.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.698
I made it for myself.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.667
And I was gonna wear it
on my date with Eli,

36:08.700 --> 36:09.735
and so I
brought it to school,

36:09.768 --> 36:13.205
and then I guess
you found it
on the rack and...

36:14.673 --> 36:15.741
Great.

36:18.244 --> 36:19.945
I screwed that up too.

36:19.978 --> 36:22.748
No, everything
turned out fine.

36:23.649 --> 36:24.650
Sort of.

36:25.651 --> 36:27.753
Come on, Mom.
You're upset.

36:27.786 --> 36:30.689
And we both know
it has nothing to do
with the costumes.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.191
(SIGHS)

36:39.731 --> 36:41.767
Dakota's right.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.670
All I ever do
is avoid things

36:44.703 --> 36:47.273
and run away from love
and commitment.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.278
I did it with your dad.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.745
And you.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.214
And Ben.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.285
And anyone else I ever loved.

37:03.322 --> 37:05.724
Now I'm doing it with Dakota.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.665
And it needs to stop.

37:13.699 --> 37:15.267
Does that mean
you're leaving?

37:21.307 --> 37:26.312
If I work this
out with Dakota,

37:27.713 --> 37:30.849
if I finally grow up,

37:34.853 --> 37:37.022
I think, in the end,

37:37.055 --> 37:39.291
I can be a better
mother to you.

37:41.760 --> 37:45.731
But I have to go to him
now to make that happen.

37:48.334 --> 37:49.835
I get it.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.269
Jane.

37:52.338 --> 37:54.740
Things are different
with us now.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.776
We are in each
other's lives

37:57.809 --> 38:00.812
and that's not
gonna change. Not ever.

38:00.846 --> 38:03.315
I'll come visit.
You come visit.

38:04.350 --> 38:05.717
Will we talk?

38:05.751 --> 38:07.786
Every day. I promise.

38:09.087 --> 38:11.357
And I will not disappear.

38:18.364 --> 38:21.099
Well, then
you'd better hurry.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.902
'Cause you have got
a plane to catch.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.739
You'll explain it to Ben?

38:27.773 --> 38:28.874
Yeah.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.878
He'll understand.

38:32.911 --> 38:35.381
And I'm sure
he'll be very happy
to have his bed back.

38:37.383 --> 38:39.918
I love you, Jane.
(CHUCKLES)

38:41.787 --> 38:42.888
I love you, too, Mom.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.358
(SIGHS)

38:47.426 --> 38:48.427
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

38:58.169 --> 39:00.806
Hey, man.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.141
Well, that was
awkward. Sorry.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.777
That's why they
call it(CHUCKLES) club.

39:05.811 --> 39:07.779
Actually,
I can't blame you
for being on edge.

39:07.813 --> 39:09.881
It couldn't
have been easy
watching me kiss Zoe.

39:09.915 --> 39:11.850
Especially after
what I did with Lulu.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.920
Yeah, you did kind of
screw me over in that
department, didn't you?

39:14.953 --> 39:15.987
(CHUCKLES)

39:16.021 --> 39:17.923
We're kind of on the road
to getting past that,

39:17.956 --> 39:19.925
which is why
I'm gonna quit the play.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.860
What, man? No,
you don't have to do that.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.429
I think
we both know I do.

39:26.164 --> 39:28.967
That's what I thought.
I'll see you around, Billy.

39:36.975 --> 39:40.412
Jane,
I've got big news!

39:40.446 --> 39:41.880
Me, too.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.817
Ben, after I came
home from my date...

39:45.851 --> 39:46.885
Yes, Ben?

39:46.918 --> 39:48.854
Yes, you can go first.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.423
Thanks.
Baseball wants me!

39:51.457 --> 39:52.824
What?

39:52.858 --> 39:55.193
They're signing me to
a minor league contract.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.162
I might have a chance
to play in the majors.

39:57.195 --> 39:58.930
I know, right?

39:58.964 --> 40:01.199
Ben,
this is so amazing,
and are you packing?

40:01.232 --> 40:02.901
Why are you packing?

40:02.934 --> 40:05.971
Well, here's the kicker.
If I want to do this,

40:06.004 --> 40:09.207
I've got to get
on the team bus which
goes to Ohio tonight.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.442
Tonight?

40:10.476 --> 40:11.877
In fact, in an hour.

40:13.479 --> 40:14.846
Where's Mom?

40:14.880 --> 40:16.848
Mom? Why?

40:16.882 --> 40:20.018
Because, and I can't
believe I'm actually
gonna saying this,

40:21.920 --> 40:23.989
I want to thank her.
This is my second chance,

40:24.022 --> 40:27.225
and if she hadn't come back,
it wouldn't be possible.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.895
But she's here,
which means I can go!

40:34.933 --> 40:37.469
I mean,
if that's okay with you.

40:37.503 --> 40:39.037
Only if it's
okay with you.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.974
I get it.
You don't want me to go.

40:43.008 --> 40:44.476
I don't have to go.
I won't.

40:44.510 --> 40:46.011
No, no, no.
Gosh, no. I'm just...

40:46.044 --> 40:48.514
I'm so happy for you.

40:48.547 --> 40:50.982
This is your second chance.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.484
Might not get another.

40:53.985 --> 40:55.487
I knew you'd get
how big this is.

40:55.521 --> 40:57.022
I do. I totally do.

41:00.025 --> 41:02.928
Are you sure
you're gonna be
okay with Mom?

41:02.961 --> 41:04.530
Yeah.
Yeah, it'll be great.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.965
Just us girls.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.033
So, where is she?

41:08.066 --> 41:10.001
She's out. With Dakota.

41:10.035 --> 41:12.504
It's gonna be a while,
but I'll tell her
you said goodbye.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.273
Go.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.042
I'm gonna miss you.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.945
I'll miss you, too, Ben.

41:22.981 --> 41:23.882
Break a leg.

41:23.915 --> 41:26.518
You don't say that
in sports, but thanks.

41:27.285 --> 41:28.587
Break bats?

41:42.568 --> 41:43.935
Ben!

41:43.969 --> 41:46.004
Hey. Rita? How did you...

41:46.037 --> 41:48.940
I stopped by the house and
Jane told me you'd be here.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.542
So you heard the news?

41:50.576 --> 41:52.544
Yeah. I did.

41:55.013 --> 41:58.083
Look, I know
I was the one
who wanted distance

41:58.116 --> 41:59.951
and I'm sorry.

41:59.985 --> 42:01.019
Look...

42:03.054 --> 42:04.522
It's okay.

42:05.991 --> 42:08.594
Turns out
it was a good thing.

42:08.627 --> 42:10.962
IYeah.?

42:10.996 --> 42:13.999
It's like
the stars aligned.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.601
If my mom
hadn't come back,

42:15.634 --> 42:17.569
and if we
were still together

42:17.603 --> 42:19.571
I wouldn't be getting
on this bus right now.

42:22.007 --> 42:23.141
That's great.

42:26.144 --> 42:28.580
So, why did you
come down here?

42:30.348 --> 42:33.151
I just wanted to
say good luck.

42:34.352 --> 42:35.587
Thanks.

42:41.126 --> 42:42.160
That, um,

42:43.061 --> 42:44.162
means a lot.

42:47.098 --> 42:48.166
Bye.

43:03.148 --> 43:05.150
Oh, my God,
I'm all alone.

43:09.688 --> 43:11.189
I'm all alone.

43:14.125 --> 43:15.627
