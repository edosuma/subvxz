WEBVTT

00:07.421 --> 00:10.892
Where's Trish? How long does it
take to walk across the mall?

00:10.893 --> 00:14.562
I'm starving. What kind of waitress
takes 20 minutes to get to a table?

00:14.563 --> 00:17.632
Guess who got a job
at The Melody Diner!

00:17.633 --> 00:20.753
That kind of waitress.

00:21.637 --> 00:23.233
So what do you wanna eat?

00:23.234 --> 00:25.640
I thought you had to sing
to the customers here.

00:25.641 --> 00:30.478
Yeah, we're supposed to, but the
manager's not looking, so who cares?

00:30.479 --> 00:33.959
Wait, Mindy's your manager?

00:36.485 --> 00:39.657
She's the worst. She's always
looking over my shoulder,

00:39.658 --> 00:42.657
bossing me around. She
drives me nuts...

00:42.658 --> 00:45.942
Are in the brownies, so
save room for dessert!

00:45.943 --> 00:47.929
Hey, Mindy.

00:47.930 --> 00:50.069
I hope you're giving this
table your best service,

00:50.070 --> 00:53.535
because it's got my
favorite customer.

00:53.536 --> 00:57.323
I'm talking about
you, Dezzy-cakes.

00:57.324 --> 01:01.132
I know you have a crush on me, Mindy, but
I'm better at long-distance relationships.

01:01.133 --> 01:03.313
Maybe you should go
stand over there...

01:03.314 --> 01:05.834
Or in Alaska.

01:06.682 --> 01:09.884
You're so cute when
you joke around.

01:09.885 --> 01:12.416
You were joking, right?

01:12.417 --> 01:14.937
Yeah, totally.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.462
Oh.

01:21.697 --> 01:23.535
So can I take your order now?

01:23.536 --> 01:25.097
Can we get a new waitress?

01:25.098 --> 01:26.734
Why, because I'm not singing?

01:26.735 --> 01:30.755
No. I want her to
be my waitress.

01:32.198 --> 01:34.556
Trish, who is that?

01:34.557 --> 01:37.679
That's Cassidy. She's our
best singing waitress.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.482
Hey, Cassidy, come over here
and tell them the specials.

01:40.483 --> 01:43.590
<i>Now the soup of the day
is cream of spinach.</i>

01:43.591 --> 01:46.302
<i>But hold on, because
I ain't finished.</i>

01:46.303 --> 01:49.176
<i>I can sing a ballad...</i>

01:49.177 --> 01:51.856
<i>About our Cobb salad.</i>

01:51.857 --> 01:55.370
I'll have a Cobb salad!
You have a great voice.

01:55.371 --> 01:57.532
I sing too. I'm Austin Moon.

01:57.533 --> 01:59.391
He's an Internet sensation.

01:59.392 --> 02:01.126
He's sort of a big deal.

02:01.127 --> 02:04.606
This is his friend Dez.
He's not a big deal.

02:04.607 --> 02:07.842
I'm Ally. I don't
know what my deal is.

02:07.843 --> 02:12.747
Well, it's great to meet you
Ally, big deal, not a big deal.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.419
You'll have a better
shot on a full stomach.

02:18.420 --> 02:21.292
Whatever you do, don't
order the chips and salsa.

02:21.293 --> 02:23.090
Why? I want chips and salsa.

02:23.091 --> 02:24.626
Did somebody say salsa?

02:24.627 --> 02:26.607
Salsa!

02:33.536 --> 02:37.796
- Can I change my order?
- No! Dance!

02:41.915 --> 02:45.017
<i>When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

02:45.018 --> 02:48.152
<i>'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

02:48.153 --> 02:49.684
<i>You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

02:49.685 --> 02:51.303
<i>You're the perfect chord.</i>

02:51.304 --> 02:54.348
<i>And I see our names together
on every billboard.</i>

02:54.349 --> 02:57.407
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock.</i>

02:57.408 --> 02:59.021
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

02:59.022 --> 03:01.344
<i>And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

03:01.345 --> 03:05.482
<i>Oh, there's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:05.483 --> 03:08.518
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:08.519 --> 03:11.588
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

03:11.589 --> 03:14.911
<i>With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

03:14.912 --> 03:17.561
<i>I own this dream.</i>

03:17.562 --> 03:20.939
<i>'Cause I got you with me.</i>

03:20.940 --> 03:24.057
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:24.058 --> 03:28.378
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:35.487 --> 03:37.310
Woo! I'm stuffed.

03:37.311 --> 03:40.022
- Let's get out of here.
- Hold on.

03:40.023 --> 03:42.569
Not before my Dezzy-muffin
tries some of our famous...

03:42.570 --> 03:44.895
<i>Cha-cha chicken pot pie.</i>

03:44.896 --> 03:47.196
- It'll blow your mind.
- I just don't see how chicken...

03:47.197 --> 03:49.837
I said eat it!

03:52.023 --> 03:53.879
<i>Cha-cha-cha-cha...</i>

03:53.880 --> 03:56.100
<i>Me likey!</i>

03:58.916 --> 04:01.323
There she is. I'm gonna
go ask her out now.

04:01.324 --> 04:04.204
- Oh wait.
- What?

04:04.407 --> 04:06.263
- What are you doing?
- I'm just... Okay.

04:06.264 --> 04:08.352
It's okay. No, it's okay.
It's okay.

04:08.353 --> 04:11.233
Go get her, tiger.

04:15.936 --> 04:17.856
'Sup?

04:18.903 --> 04:22.379
Hey, blondie. 'Sup with you?

04:22.380 --> 04:26.580
Hey, Cassidy, you
have a great voice.

04:26.872 --> 04:29.573
Do you ever sing about
anything besides food?

04:29.574 --> 04:31.842
As a matter of fact, I do.
I'm in a band.

04:31.843 --> 04:34.550
No way. We have so
much in common.

04:34.551 --> 04:38.669
We both love music, um,
we're both in high school

04:38.670 --> 04:43.230
and we're both holding
bottles of ketchup.

04:45.602 --> 04:47.642
Cheers.

04:48.492 --> 04:50.989
- You're cute.
- Thanks.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.933
So, Cassidy, I was wondering...

04:53.934 --> 04:56.099
Do you wanna maybe
go out sometime?

04:56.100 --> 04:57.601
Sorry, I can't.

04:57.602 --> 04:59.395
Great! I'll meet you at...

04:59.396 --> 05:00.706
What?

05:00.707 --> 05:02.687
Sorry.

05:06.578 --> 05:09.458
I'm sorry, Austin.

05:09.548 --> 05:11.417
Eh, it's cool.

05:11.418 --> 05:14.061
Maybe some dessert will
make you feel better.

05:14.062 --> 05:16.787
I don't feel like dancing,
so whatever you do,

05:16.788 --> 05:19.523
don't order the chocolate
shake, the lemon twist or...

05:19.524 --> 05:21.263
Get the raspberry robot.

05:21.264 --> 05:24.504
- No!
- Raspberry robot!

05:25.347 --> 05:27.687
Yay! Robot!

05:29.000 --> 05:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:42.481 --> 05:44.432
Okay, I was thinking about this.

05:44.433 --> 05:48.227
There are only three possible reasons
why Cassidy won't go out with you.

05:48.228 --> 05:49.475
I'm listening.

05:49.476 --> 05:51.522
One, she has a boyfriend...

05:51.523 --> 05:53.685
Two, she misunderstood
your question...

05:53.686 --> 05:55.315
- Three...
- She's a mermaid

05:55.316 --> 05:59.118
and her dad won't let
her date humans?

05:59.119 --> 06:02.980
I was gonna say she just
might not be into you.

06:02.981 --> 06:06.952
I think my reason
makes more sense.

06:06.953 --> 06:09.932
Hey, buddy, I hear you're
having some lady problems.

06:09.933 --> 06:11.783
I can help. They call me...

06:11.784 --> 06:14.589
The love whisperer.

06:14.590 --> 06:15.672
Thanks.

06:15.673 --> 06:18.419
And no one calls you that.

06:18.420 --> 06:24.320
Yes, they do. You just can't hear
them because they're whispering it.

06:24.397 --> 06:27.008
Let's stop whispering.

06:27.009 --> 06:30.007
This is serious. I
really like this girl.

06:30.008 --> 06:31.709
I can't stop thinking about her.

06:31.710 --> 06:37.003
Oh. Just like I can't stop thinking
about that cha-cha chicken pot pie.

06:37.004 --> 06:40.017
Anyway, I'm an expert in love.

06:40.018 --> 06:44.448
I have been rejected so many times,
I can show you what not to do.

06:44.449 --> 06:46.549
Observe.

06:47.759 --> 06:49.424
Excuse me.

06:49.425 --> 06:52.556
I'm Dez. I don't have a job and
I only shower once a week.

06:52.557 --> 06:56.937
How would you like
to be my girlfriend?

06:58.604 --> 07:00.905
See? Do not do that.

07:00.906 --> 07:03.552
The love whisperer.

07:03.553 --> 07:06.683
That gets creepier
every time you say it.

07:06.684 --> 07:09.204
Yes, it does.

07:12.392 --> 07:14.852
I just wish I knew why
Cassidy said no to me,

07:14.853 --> 07:16.887
then I could figure out a
way to make her like me.

07:16.888 --> 07:18.855
Oh, I know why she said no.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.571
- I talked to her.
- You did?

07:21.572 --> 07:23.432
Ooh!

07:23.582 --> 07:25.663
What did she say?
What did she say?

07:25.664 --> 07:29.426
Well, she said she won't
go out with you because...

07:29.427 --> 07:30.635
Hang on.

07:30.636 --> 07:32.348
Hello.

07:32.349 --> 07:35.809
Would I like to take
a 20-minute survey?

07:35.810 --> 07:38.330
I sure would!

07:38.411 --> 07:41.219
Yes. Bananas. Yes.

07:41.220 --> 07:44.104
Oh, that's a tough one.
Gorgonzola.

07:44.105 --> 07:45.217
What did she say?!

07:45.218 --> 07:48.643
She just asked me what
my favorite cheese is.

07:48.644 --> 07:50.975
Not the lady on the phone...
Cassidy.

07:50.976 --> 07:55.291
Oh. She said the only reason why
she's not going out with you,

07:55.292 --> 07:58.851
is because all she has time
for is work and her band.

07:58.852 --> 08:01.075
That's a perfectly good reason.

08:01.076 --> 08:05.191
See, Austin? I told you
she wasn't a mermaid.

08:05.192 --> 08:08.027
You had to be there.

08:08.028 --> 08:11.030
So it's not me. She's
just too busy.

08:11.031 --> 08:12.937
If I wanna see her...

08:12.938 --> 08:16.445
I can either join her band or...

08:16.446 --> 08:18.815
<i>My name's Austin,
I'll be your waiter.</i>

08:18.816 --> 08:23.376
<i>The soup of the day
is cream of potater!</i>

08:24.271 --> 08:29.431
So yeah, what do you guys...
I'll be right back.

08:37.808 --> 08:41.217
Wow. You took this job just
to be close to Cassidy.

08:41.217 --> 08:43.743
That is so romantic.

08:43.744 --> 08:46.506
Yeah, now I just need
to figure out a way...

08:46.507 --> 08:47.427
Manager alert!

08:47.428 --> 08:50.968
<i>A way to make her like me.</i>

08:51.731 --> 08:55.571
<i>There's my new celebrity waiter.</i>

08:56.690 --> 09:00.590
<i>And there's my Dezzy-wezzy-kins.</i>

09:01.028 --> 09:03.869
Yeah, I think that's
Dezzy-wezzy-kins' cue to leave.

09:03.870 --> 09:06.453
Hmm. I have more
chicken pot pie.

09:06.454 --> 09:10.114
I can stay for a little bit.

09:10.303 --> 09:13.893
Trish! Can you finish training Austin?
I'm kind of busy here.

09:13.894 --> 09:16.192
Or maybe Cassidy can train him.

09:16.193 --> 09:20.104
Don't care, long as
he gets trained.

09:20.105 --> 09:22.315
Yes! I get to hang
out with Cassidy.

09:22.316 --> 09:23.582
Thanks for looking
out for me, Trish.

09:23.583 --> 09:26.452
Huh? No, I was just
looking out for me.

09:26.453 --> 09:29.105
I don't wanna do any extra work.

09:29.106 --> 09:32.226
But you still owe me.

09:34.605 --> 09:36.405
Ah.

09:37.597 --> 09:41.434
Hey, Cassidy, Mindy
wants you to train me.

09:41.435 --> 09:44.773
Scoot over. Gotta hear this.

09:44.774 --> 09:47.618
Okay, new guy, watch and learn.

09:47.619 --> 09:49.608
<i>Here are your onion rings.</i>

09:49.609 --> 09:51.577
<i>Lots of joy are what they bring.</i>

09:51.578 --> 09:53.620
<i>Don't you like your
veggies fried?</i>

09:53.621 --> 09:57.581
<i>Here are your
sauces on the side.</i>

09:57.684 --> 09:59.914
Whoa. That was like
the best song.

09:59.915 --> 10:03.055
- I've ever heard about onion rings.
- Thanks.

10:03.056 --> 10:06.227
The best part about this job
is getting to sing all day.

10:06.228 --> 10:11.388
Music is the only thing
that really speaks to me.

10:14.115 --> 10:18.435
Okay, Ally, you can
stop spying on me.

10:19.376 --> 10:22.316
I'm over here now!

10:23.002 --> 10:25.379
Austin, this is perfect.

10:25.380 --> 10:27.759
Cassidy just told you what
to do to win her over.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.061
Music is the only thing
that speaks to her.

10:30.062 --> 10:33.311
You have to write her a song
that comes from your heart.

10:33.312 --> 10:36.693
Great, so tell me what
comes from my heart.

10:36.694 --> 10:38.750
Austin, I need you.

10:38.751 --> 10:40.597
I need you too.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.712
I mean... I mean...

10:42.713 --> 10:45.669
I need you to tell
me why you need me.

10:45.670 --> 10:47.871
Are, uh... Are you okay?

10:47.872 --> 10:49.706
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

10:49.707 --> 10:53.227
Because your hand's in
the mac and cheese.

10:53.228 --> 10:54.320
Hot.

10:54.321 --> 10:58.555
Just checking if it's
hot enough, and it is.

10:58.556 --> 10:59.716
Hot!

10:59.717 --> 11:01.817
Ah. Oh.

11:03.119 --> 11:05.231
We need to go write that song.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.092
Hot.

11:11.696 --> 11:14.849
Okay, a song from the heart
needs some real emotion,

11:14.850 --> 11:16.723
so what do you like
about Cassidy?

11:16.724 --> 11:19.368
- She's perfect.
- "Perfect." Got it.

11:19.369 --> 11:23.512
- But not too perfect.
- "Not perfect." Got it.

11:23.513 --> 11:25.395
Why don't you tell me
how she makes you feel?

11:25.396 --> 11:27.844
Like I'm wearing a new
pair of sneakers.

11:27.845 --> 11:30.383
Or I'm about to eat pancakes.

11:30.384 --> 11:33.586
Or I just did a big loop-de-loop
on a roller coaster,

11:33.587 --> 11:37.298
and I'm trying not to throw up.

11:37.299 --> 11:39.525
So she makes you feel like
you're gonna throw up,

11:39.526 --> 11:43.385
pancakes all over
your new sneakers?

11:43.386 --> 11:45.606
Yeah. No.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.831
I don't know. You're
the songwriter.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.600
You tell me how I feel.

11:50.601 --> 11:54.838
Ooh! And throw something in
there about onion rings.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.773
Okay, onion rings.

11:56.774 --> 12:00.462
Would you like to be throwing
them up or just eating them?

12:00.463 --> 12:04.815
I don't care, as long as
this song makes her happy...

12:04.816 --> 12:06.850
Because I really like her.

12:06.851 --> 12:11.831
I gotta get back to work
and stare at Cassidy.

12:18.563 --> 12:23.603
Ally, I think I have a
chicken pot pie problem.

12:25.054 --> 12:27.094
Go on.

12:32.410 --> 12:35.121
More chicken pot pie!

12:35.122 --> 12:38.482
Here you go, Dezzy-cakes.

12:39.817 --> 12:43.182
You know when the cha-cha
pies run out, so does Dez.

12:43.183 --> 12:48.943
Then I guess we'll have to
make sure they never run out.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.962
Dez!

12:51.796 --> 12:53.630
Cha-cha-cha-cha--
cha-cha-cha-cha...

12:53.631 --> 12:57.651
Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha!

12:59.152 --> 13:01.332
Austin, I gotta talk to
you about this song.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.907
- That's the song? Great.
- Austin, wait! It's not done!

13:03.908 --> 13:07.187
Ladies and gentlemen, can I
have your attention, please?

13:07.188 --> 13:10.261
I'd like to dedicate this song
to the coolest girl in here...

13:10.262 --> 13:12.362
Cassidy.

13:14.852 --> 13:17.921
<i>You're perfect, but
not too perfect.</i>

13:17.922 --> 13:22.756
<i>You're the pat of butter
on my pancake stack.</i>

13:22.757 --> 13:25.964
<i>You're a roller coaster ride.</i>

13:25.965 --> 13:28.357
<i>And I feel like...</i>

13:28.358 --> 13:30.320
<i>Throwing up.</i>

13:30.321 --> 13:33.741
<i>Cassidy, go out with me...</i>

13:35.370 --> 13:36.911
<i>Something about...</i>

13:36.912 --> 13:39.432
<i>Onion rings...</i>

13:40.243 --> 13:42.163
<i>Ings.</i>

14:00.987 --> 14:02.623
What am I gonna do?

14:02.624 --> 14:05.559
Cassidy hated the song and
now she's not gonna like me.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.661
I told you the
song wasn't ready.

14:07.662 --> 14:10.631
You called her "the butter
on my pancake stack."

14:10.632 --> 14:13.962
If anything, she's the syrup.

14:13.963 --> 14:15.902
I just wrote all the
stuff you told me.

14:15.903 --> 14:17.904
You're the one who can't
communicate your feelings.

14:17.905 --> 14:19.873
I can so communicate
my feelings.

14:19.874 --> 14:22.401
And right now I'm feeling...

14:22.402 --> 14:24.562
Feelings!

14:24.612 --> 14:26.648
<i>Austin, you know the rules.</i>

14:26.649 --> 14:28.742
<i>You have to sing
to the customers.</i>

14:28.743 --> 14:30.963
<i>Now sing!</i>

14:32.854 --> 14:35.756
<i>Ally, all I wanted was
a song for Cassidy</i>

14:35.757 --> 14:37.624
<i>but you let me down.</i>

14:37.625 --> 14:40.428
<i>I did the best I could
with what you gave me.</i>

14:40.429 --> 14:45.109
<i>Why am I singing? I
don't even work here.</i>

14:45.533 --> 14:48.991
<i>I'm all out of chicken pot pies.
I need some more now...</i>

14:48.992 --> 14:51.032
<i>Please!</i>

14:53.513 --> 14:58.512
<i>Trish, get my Dezzy-roo some
more chicken pot pie now!</i>

14:58.513 --> 15:00.916
<i>Don't snap your fingers at me.</i>

15:00.917 --> 15:04.149
<i>And stop taking
advantage of my friend.</i>

15:04.150 --> 15:08.116
<i>Ewe, did I just call
Dezzy-roo my friend?</i>

15:08.117 --> 15:12.257
<i>Ewe, did I just
call him Dezzy-roo?</i>

15:12.961 --> 15:17.461
<i>Somebody just get me
my chicken pot pie.</i>

15:17.818 --> 15:21.178
<i>I don't care who it is.</i>

15:25.781 --> 15:28.270
<i>Trish, I don't like
your attitude.</i>

15:28.271 --> 15:30.674
<i>You're fired, you're fired.</i>

15:30.675 --> 15:33.855
<i>Fi... I-I-I-I... red!</i>

15:34.718 --> 15:37.509
<i>You can't fire me,
because I quit.</i>

15:37.510 --> 15:39.175
<i>I quit, I quit, I quit...</i>

15:39.176 --> 15:41.456
<i>I quit...!</i>

15:42.890 --> 15:44.690
Oh!

15:45.910 --> 15:48.442
<i>I just wanted to
be a good friend,</i>

15:48.443 --> 15:50.228
<i>and help you out.</i>

15:50.229 --> 15:53.469
<i>Why am I singing again?</i>

15:54.222 --> 15:56.194
<i>Well, you definitely helped.</i>

15:56.195 --> 15:59.779
<i>You helped me blow my
chances with Cassidy.</i>

15:59.780 --> 16:04.520
I can't believe you're
blaming me for this.

16:07.482 --> 16:11.022
<i>Fine, I'll get my own pie.</i>

16:22.828 --> 16:27.527
I just can't believe he's blaming me.
I was trying to help.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.630
Hey, Ally, got a second?

16:30.631 --> 16:32.217
Yeah, sure.

16:32.218 --> 16:35.542
You can go, Trish.
Thanks for listening.

16:35.543 --> 16:37.403
Huh?

16:37.745 --> 16:40.515
You were talking to me?

16:40.516 --> 16:43.213
Yes, I thought you
were taking notes.

16:43.214 --> 16:47.067
No, I was taking a survey about
how to be a better listener.

16:47.068 --> 16:51.448
On a scale of one
to 10, how'd I do?

16:52.247 --> 16:55.907
I'm gonna call that a seven.

16:57.498 --> 16:59.691
Ally, I'm so sorry.

16:59.692 --> 17:01.814
I acted like a total jerk.

17:01.815 --> 17:05.202
I just never been this
crazy about anyone.

17:05.203 --> 17:08.451
I get it. Sometimes crushes
make people lose their minds,

17:08.452 --> 17:11.800
like how I act like a
fool around Dallas.

17:11.801 --> 17:13.680
Yeah, whenever he's around,

17:13.681 --> 17:16.915
you always say stupid
things and dance all goofy.

17:16.916 --> 17:18.244
Woo!

17:18.246 --> 17:20.406
Woo-hoo!

17:21.756 --> 17:23.594
Cassidy just...

17:23.595 --> 17:26.526
She makes my heart beat
like a mile a minute.

17:26.527 --> 17:29.527
I can't explain it.

17:30.598 --> 17:32.337
But you just did.

17:32.338 --> 17:36.317
That's the first real feeling about
Cassidy you've been able to express.

17:36.318 --> 17:38.979
You're right! We can use
that in a new song for her!

17:38.980 --> 17:41.302
Oh, you think I'm just
gonna write another song

17:41.303 --> 17:44.340
for you because you finally
opened up your heart?

17:44.341 --> 17:45.679
You're not?

17:45.680 --> 17:47.681
Of course I am!

17:47.682 --> 17:49.546
I love romance!

17:49.547 --> 17:52.067
Thanks, Ally. You're awesome.

17:52.068 --> 17:54.588
Dance it out?

17:55.823 --> 17:59.330
Okay, that's what
I'm talking about.

17:59.331 --> 18:02.662
What about... What about like...

18:02.663 --> 18:04.664
It's okay. It was part of it.
It was part of it.

18:04.665 --> 18:09.165
It was... That was a
part of your dance.

18:12.072 --> 18:15.709
Excuse me, Miss. Can you
please sing me the specials?

18:15.710 --> 18:17.613
I already sang them
for you seven times.

18:17.614 --> 18:21.697
Well, I'm a customer now and I would
like to hear them eight times.

18:21.698 --> 18:26.218
<i>Today's specials are chicken
parmesan on a bed of Linguini.</i>

18:26.219 --> 18:31.199
You can stop singing.
We'll take two of those.

18:33.561 --> 18:35.762
I'm not gonna eat any more
chicken pot pie, Mindy.

18:35.763 --> 18:37.898
It's taking over my life!

18:37.899 --> 18:42.213
So this is the last time
I'm coming in here.

18:42.214 --> 18:43.665
Okay, Dezzy-cheeks.

18:43.666 --> 18:45.817
Well, if this is your last
time coming in here, let me at

18:45.818 --> 18:51.578
least give you some of our
famous egg salad on the house.

18:54.715 --> 18:56.716
- Eat it.
- No thanks, I'm...

18:56.717 --> 19:00.317
I said eat it! Just eat it.

19:00.788 --> 19:02.316
Oh no.

19:02.317 --> 19:04.537
<i>Me likey.</i>

19:07.101 --> 19:10.181
Hey, Cassidy. Sorry
about that song.

19:10.182 --> 19:13.867
It's cool. I mean, it was weird being
compared to butter on pancakes.

19:13.868 --> 19:15.922
If anything, I'm the syrup.

19:15.923 --> 19:18.132
You are so the syrup.

19:18.133 --> 19:21.671
Anyway, that song didn't
say what I wanted it to...

19:21.672 --> 19:23.296
But this one does.

19:23.297 --> 19:25.217
Guys!

19:26.337 --> 19:28.914
<i>I can get your heartbeat
beat-beat-beating like.</i>

19:28.915 --> 19:31.403
<i>I can get your heartbeat
beating like that.</i>

19:31.404 --> 19:33.880
<i>You know you got my heartbeat
beat-beat-beating like...</i>

19:33.881 --> 19:36.380
<i>Hey-ay-ay-ay.</i>

19:36.381 --> 19:38.892
<i>Would you, would you want it
if I stood up above the crowd?</i>

19:38.893 --> 19:41.596
<i>Got up on a chair and if I
shouted your name aloud.</i>

19:41.597 --> 19:43.948
<i>Could you, could you take me,
call me baby without a doubt?</i>

19:43.949 --> 19:46.552
<i>I'm shouting your name right now,
shouting your name right now.</i>

19:46.553 --> 19:48.992
<i>Don't you get it, get it? I'm
nothing like them other ones.</i>

19:48.993 --> 19:51.487
<i>Raised upon the notion, I
ain't hosting no reruns.</i>

19:51.488 --> 19:53.952
<i>I said it, said it, said it,
wouldn't let it be all or none.</i>

19:53.953 --> 19:56.292
<i>Because I ain't no
rerun, I ain't no rerun.</i>

19:56.293 --> 19:58.878
<i>I'll make you forget, forget.</i>

19:58.879 --> 20:01.289
<i>What you came here
for, here for.</i>

20:01.290 --> 20:04.498
<i>For goodness sake, let's
make or break this heart.</i>

20:04.499 --> 20:06.753
<i>Because it needs more.</i>

20:06.754 --> 20:09.249
<i>I can get your heartbeat
beat-beat-beating like.</i>

20:09.250 --> 20:11.758
<i>I can get your heartbeat
beating like that.</i>

20:11.759 --> 20:14.298
<i>You know you got my heartbeat
beat-beat-beating like...</i>

20:14.299 --> 20:16.806
<i>Hey-ay-ay-ay.</i>

20:16.807 --> 20:19.377
<i>I can get your heartbeat
beat-beat-beating like.</i>

20:19.378 --> 20:21.901
<i>I can get your heartbeat
beating like that.</i>

20:21.902 --> 20:24.399
<i>You know you got my heartbeat
beat-beat-beating like...</i>

20:24.400 --> 20:27.100
<i>Hey-ay-ay-ay...</i>

20:27.372 --> 20:28.380
<i>Hey hey.</i>

20:28.381 --> 20:30.028
<i>Let me hear you like...</i>

20:30.029 --> 20:32.353
<i>Hey hey hey...</i>

20:32.354 --> 20:33.390
<i>Hey hey.</i>

20:33.391 --> 20:34.658
<i>Can you do it like...?</i>

20:34.659 --> 20:37.239
<i>Hey-ay-ay-ay.</i>

20:44.272 --> 20:47.472
That was amazing. I can't
believe you wrote that for me.

20:47.473 --> 20:49.602
Thanks. It came from my heart...

20:49.603 --> 20:52.507
- Yeah.
- And my mouth.

20:52.508 --> 20:54.544
So what do you say? Will
you go out with me?

20:54.545 --> 20:57.426
- I'd love to go out with you...
- Yes! Woo!

20:57.427 --> 20:59.159
But I can't.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.937
You can't... Wait
to go out with me?

21:01.938 --> 21:04.656
My band just got a record deal.
We're going to L.A.

21:04.657 --> 21:07.292
Today is my last day.

21:07.293 --> 21:10.629
Oh. I'm really happy for you.

21:10.630 --> 21:11.997
Thanks, blondie.

21:11.998 --> 21:17.518
I promise the second I get
back we'll have that date.

21:19.906 --> 21:23.269
Woo! Well, we're not going out.

21:23.270 --> 21:24.695
Her band's going to L.A.

21:24.696 --> 21:27.013
And I may never see her again.

21:27.014 --> 21:29.161
Then why do you seem so happy?

21:29.162 --> 21:34.689
Because I know she likes me,
and I owe it all to Ally.

21:34.690 --> 21:36.169
Ally?

21:36.170 --> 21:38.939
More chicken pot pie!

21:38.940 --> 21:42.000
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm.

21:46.786 --> 21:50.840
<i>I'm gonna make, make, make
your chocolate milkshake.</i>

21:50.841 --> 21:52.562
Bam! Woo!

21:52.563 --> 21:56.976
<i>Yeah! Because I know you want ketchup.
It's my favorite condiment.</i>

21:56.977 --> 22:00.539
<i>A side of fries is
what you'll get.</i>

22:00.540 --> 22:05.160
<i>We ran out of big hotdogs, so
I got you just a small one.</i>

22:05.161 --> 22:09.478
<i>It's not a foot long. No,
it's not a foot long.</i>

22:09.479 --> 22:13.494
<i>There's no way I can get you the
coleslaw, get you the coleslaw.</i>

22:13.495 --> 22:17.822
<i>No substitutions. Here's
your onion rings.</i>

22:17.823 --> 22:20.696
<i>I'll be right back with drinks.</i>

22:20.697 --> 22:23.371
<i>I talked to my boss she
said you can have coleslaw,</i>

22:23.372 --> 22:26.069
<i>you can have coleslaw.
Here is your coleslaw.</i>

22:26.070 --> 22:28.290
Bam! Woo!
