and the girlies want to scream

00:33.880 --> 00:35.810
'Cause we are the Aqua Teens

00:35.880 --> 00:39.340
Make the homies say "ho!"

Written and illustrated by
Robb Zhombee.

00:54.060 --> 00:54.890
Hey, wait.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.520
No, l want you to read
"Jimmy the Jet Engine."

00:56.600 --> 00:58.900
Eh, just a few pages...
so you can relax.

00:58.970 --> 01:00.700
Please don't read that book.

01:00.770 --> 01:01.740
l don't like that book.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.200
Once upon a time,

01:03.270 --> 01:07.440
there was a beautiful
little girl.

01:07.510 --> 01:08.940
What happened to her?

01:09.010 --> 01:11.140
"Her mom threw acid on her face

01:11.210 --> 01:12.310
because she was
jealous of her beauty."

01:12.380 --> 01:13.210
No.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.480
"'Skulldilocks!

01:14.550 --> 01:15.520
Skulldilocks!'

01:15.590 --> 01:18.180
That's what the schoolchildren cried.

01:18.250 --> 01:22.250
And she was so upset, she threw
acid on the schoolkids' faces."

01:22.330 --> 01:23.380
Oh, my goodness.

01:23.460 --> 01:26.120
"Cause somebody from the Bible
told her to do it."

01:26.200 --> 01:27.030
Now press the button.

01:27.100 --> 01:28.720
l don't want to
press the button.

01:28.800 --> 01:29.860
lf you don't press it,

01:29.930 --> 01:30.920
she's gonna come for
you in the night.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.730
With a bucket of
acid for my face?!

01:32.800 --> 01:34.960
Spoiler alert!

01:35.040 --> 01:37.010
Yes.
Press the button with all your might!

01:37.070 --> 01:38.270
No! l won't do it!

01:40.810 --> 01:45.080
"...the children said again and
again and again."

01:45.150 --> 01:46.080
Press it again.

01:49.620 --> 01:50.810
Press it again... twice, fast.

01:54.020 --> 01:56.690
"And Skulldilocks was never found.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.090
The end."

01:59.160 --> 02:00.320
Adios!

02:05.100 --> 02:08.370
See you in hell.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.430
Fine.

02:15.810 --> 02:20.240
Kill.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.510
Kill! Kill!

02:25.490 --> 02:30.120
Kill!

02:30.190 --> 02:31.290
Kill.

02:34.100 --> 02:36.190
He's cute.
Can we keep him?

02:36.270 --> 02:37.890
Please can we keep him?
Please?

02:37.970 --> 02:39.060
Uh, sure. Why not?

02:39.140 --> 02:43.340
Kill.

02:43.410 --> 02:45.170
Kill!

02:46.710 --> 02:48.230
Well, l got to run to dinner.

02:48.310 --> 02:49.140
You guys have fun.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.310
l'll be gone just long enough
for something to happen.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.970
But if anything does...

02:53.050 --> 02:54.610
don't use the phone...

02:54.680 --> 02:56.150
'cause l just cut the line.

02:56.220 --> 02:57.050
Later, haters.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.280
Okay!

02:58.350 --> 02:59.180
We'll be very safe.

02:59.260 --> 03:01.050
Hey, let's put him on the shelf.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.780
Ain't no way he can get down
from there.

03:02.860 --> 03:04.020
There you go.

03:04.090 --> 03:05.250
We'll put him up on the shelf.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.390
Oh, man.

03:07.460 --> 03:08.930
There's a storm brewing.

03:10.100 --> 03:13.130
l hope the power doesn't go out.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.370
Uh-oh.
- Oh, no.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.600
The power went out.

03:17.670 --> 03:18.870
Oh, there we go.

03:19.940 --> 03:22.100
Meatwad!

03:22.180 --> 03:24.480
But... how?

03:25.480 --> 03:27.140
l took him down.

03:27.220 --> 03:30.080
l wanted to arrange him better
next to my ceramic knickknacks

03:30.150 --> 03:31.350
and personal collectibles.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.820
Make it look good.

03:32.890 --> 03:35.050
l'm gonna go lock all these
windows.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.390
Except this one.

03:36.460 --> 03:38.260
This one, l'm gonna unlock,
for some reason.

03:38.330 --> 03:40.390
Have you seen my collectible ax?

03:40.460 --> 03:46.060
Kill!

03:46.270 --> 03:48.930
Oh, there it is.

03:49.010 --> 03:50.970
Hey, that looks great on you.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.800
Kill.
Kill. Kill!

03:52.880 --> 03:55.810
Oh, you...
you have another gift for me?

03:55.880 --> 03:58.040
They look like...

03:58.110 --> 03:59.340
human fingers.

04:03.750 --> 04:05.580
Kill!

04:06.860 --> 04:08.950
Well, l'm gonna
stand them up around you, dummy.

04:09.030 --> 04:09.860
Neat.

04:09.930 --> 04:12.520
Just like
they're little trophies to you.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.960
Yeah, let's hit the sack.

04:15.030 --> 04:17.060
Yeah, l'm pretty beat.

04:17.130 --> 04:18.329
Oh, wait.

04:18.399 --> 04:19.529
l left the scissors out.

04:27.210 --> 04:28.540
Oh, leave them out.

04:28.610 --> 04:31.050
We'll put them up in the
morning.

04:31.110 --> 04:32.380
All right.

04:32.450 --> 04:35.350
Hey, you up for me reading a
little bit of that book to you?

04:35.420 --> 04:37.650
Oh no, please don't
read that book.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.620

You know, Mickey Rooney

04:58.980 --> 05:01.340

05:01.480 --> 05:03.140
Kill, kill.

Kill, kill, kill.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.550
What's everybody doing today?

05:07.620 --> 05:08.450
l don't know.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.140
l was kind of thinking about
stealing Carl's car

05:10.220 --> 05:12.150
and taking a drive up
to the old cabin.

05:12.220 --> 05:13.880
Oh, up on, uh,
Monster Mountain.

05:13.960 --> 05:14.950
No, no, no.

05:15.020 --> 05:17.360
The old cabin...
on Mt. Terror.

05:17.430 --> 05:18.720
That's one mountain over.

05:18.790 --> 05:21.190
Why, a whole
school bus of children

05:21.260 --> 05:22.790
disappeared up there.

05:23.930 --> 05:26.700
Yeah, that was
about five years ago...

05:26.770 --> 05:28.240
today, exactly.

05:28.300 --> 05:31.670
Kill!

05:31.740 --> 05:34.470
Kill, kill,
kill, kill, kill.

05:34.540 --> 05:36.310
You know, you can
get killed up there.

05:36.380 --> 05:37.210
What?!

05:37.280 --> 05:38.180
What'd l say?

05:38.250 --> 05:39.610
Uh, you said
l could get killed up there.

05:39.680 --> 05:40.510
Oh, sorry.

05:40.580 --> 05:42.480
l meant to say you can get good
antiques up there.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.280
Why do you
think l'm going?

05:44.350 --> 05:45.650
lt's this damn dummy.

05:45.720 --> 05:46.550
Oh, yeah.

05:46.620 --> 05:49.610
He's keeping me up all night
with his "kill, kill, kill.

05:49.690 --> 05:50.620
l like to kill."

05:50.690 --> 05:53.750
l'd say, "how about you try to
get a little rest, dummy?"

05:53.830 --> 05:55.920
And he'd just go,
"kill, kill, Meatwad.

05:56.000 --> 05:56.830
Kill, kill."

05:56.900 --> 06:00.830
Kill!

06:00.900 --> 06:02.890
Kill, kill, kill.

06:02.970 --> 06:03.940

Okay. Okay.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.220
Okay!

06:18.290 --> 06:19.580
l think it's dead.

06:20.390 --> 06:22.360
Well, that's the end of that.

06:22.430 --> 06:24.390
Man, l'm glad that's over.
Whoa!

06:24.460 --> 06:31.220
Kill!

06:35.300 --> 06:37.030
Take that, you son of...

06:40.280 --> 06:41.870

06:48.750 --> 06:50.740
Well, he won't be bothering us
anymore.

06:50.820 --> 06:54.620
Kill!

06:54.690 --> 06:55.520
Dang it.

06:55.590 --> 06:56.990
Listen, the thing is,

06:57.060 --> 06:59.550
as soon as you turn your head,
he pops up behind you.

06:59.630 --> 07:00.960
lt's like a thing with him.

07:01.030 --> 07:02.690
Just keep looking.
You see him?

07:02.770 --> 07:03.820
Uh, nope.

08:34.289 --> 08:35.450
You can have the damn bed!

08:35.520 --> 08:36.750
Damn it!

08:38.159 --> 08:40.490
Those dummies sure do...

08:40.559 --> 08:41.830
get along.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.630
Yeah, l thought
they'd hit it off.

08:43.700 --> 08:47.230
They got a lot of similar interests...
slotted jaws.

08:47.300 --> 08:48.430
They're both made of wood.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.660
Can't move their fingers.

08:49.740 --> 08:51.870
Look here, l ain't running no
damn dummy boarding house.

08:51.940 --> 08:53.700
This is gonna stop,
and it's gonna stop today.

08:53.780 --> 08:55.210
Leave them to me.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.970
Clearly, ladies and gentlemen,

08:57.050 --> 08:59.210
my little wooden friend is
torched.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.940
And yet, where did he go?

09:02.020 --> 09:03.780
Voila.

09:03.850 --> 09:05.620
Kill, kill, kill!

09:05.690 --> 09:06.780
Thank you.

09:06.860 --> 09:08.690
Thank you very much.

09:08.760 --> 09:09.620
And the gorilla says,

09:09.690 --> 09:12.180
"you mean the one that
you up the ass?"

09:12.260 --> 09:13.890
And the lion says...

09:13.960 --> 09:16.560
Why?
Did it already make the papers?

09:16.630 --> 09:19.860
That's exactly what he said,
you son of a bitch.

09:19.940 --> 09:20.770
Thank you.

09:21.740 --> 09:23.430
We got a million of them.

09:24.440 --> 09:25.740
This is huge for me.

09:25.810 --> 09:26.740
You know l'm the star, right?

09:26.810 --> 09:27.640
Oh, yeah, man.

10:07.620 --> 10:08.840
They magically came to life.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.550
Because l wished it upon a star.

10:11.620 --> 10:12.780
