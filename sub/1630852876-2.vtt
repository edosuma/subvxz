WEBVTT

00:07.827 --> 00:09.044
[Narrator] Reaching the
other side of the world

00:09.068 --> 00:10.482
has never been easier.

00:11.827 --> 00:13.482
But by flying over,

00:13.517 --> 00:15.931
are we forgetting
how to travel through?

00:19.758 --> 00:21.068
Mexico City...

00:22.068 --> 00:25.103
North America's
largest Metropolis,

00:25.137 --> 00:27.896
to ushuaia, Argentina,

00:27.931 --> 00:29.862
the most southerly
city in the world.

00:30.655 --> 00:32.931
Twenty hours by plane.

00:32.965 --> 00:35.724
But could you travel the
length of Latin America

00:35.758 --> 00:38.241
without boarding a single flight

00:38.275 --> 00:40.586
and all for the
price of the air fare?

00:40.620 --> 00:42.689
[Man] What have
we got ourselves into?

00:43.862 --> 00:46.586
[Narrator] Five
pairs of ordinary brits

00:46.620 --> 00:48.241
are attempting just that.

00:49.206 --> 00:50.275
Let's go!

00:50.310 --> 00:53.241
[Narrator] They will cover
over 25,000 kilometers

00:53.275 --> 00:55.344
at ground level...

00:55.379 --> 00:58.448
Moments I guess you'll
remember for the rest of your life.

00:58.482 --> 00:59.596
[Narrator] In a demanding...

00:59.620 --> 01:01.034
Don't cry, because you get weak.

01:01.068 --> 01:02.724
And challenging race.

01:02.758 --> 01:03.620
It's no good here.

01:03.655 --> 01:06.068
Which soars high
into the andes...

01:06.103 --> 01:07.758
Crosses vast deserts...

01:08.620 --> 01:10.206
And goes deep into the jungle.

01:10.241 --> 01:11.448
Come on, what's next?

01:12.862 --> 01:15.379
They must negotiate
volatile regions...

01:15.413 --> 01:17.068
We'll be out with a gun.

01:17.103 --> 01:19.275
[Narrator] ...Without the
help of smartphones...

01:19.310 --> 01:22.517
Bank cards, and
with a limited budget.

01:22.551 --> 01:24.517
Got no Google maps, got no mom,

01:24.551 --> 01:25.586
got no food.

01:25.620 --> 01:27.275
[Narrator] Have
they got what it takes

01:27.310 --> 01:29.275
both physically...

01:29.310 --> 01:30.620
Can someone call an ambulance?

01:30.655 --> 01:32.079
If you're flying, you
don't really meet

01:32.103 --> 01:33.689
the real people
of these countries.

01:33.724 --> 01:34.862
[Narrator] And emotionally?

01:34.896 --> 01:36.517
He is quite clearly

01:36.551 --> 01:38.517
changing for the better.

01:38.551 --> 01:40.586
You need a miracle
to get out of here.

01:40.620 --> 01:42.500
I feel like this has
brought us closer together.

01:43.275 --> 01:45.034
[Narrator] The
rewards are great.

01:45.068 --> 01:46.413
This is crazy good.

01:48.965 --> 01:50.965
[Narrator] The first
team to the finish line

01:51.000 --> 01:53.896
will claim the
prize of £20,000...

01:55.793 --> 01:58.448
In a race across the world.

01:58.482 --> 01:59.310
Let's go, let's go.

01:59.344 --> 02:00.758
Vamos, vamos!

02:00.793 --> 02:03.103
Excitement, adventure, trauma.

02:04.793 --> 02:05.793
Oh, my god.

02:13.517 --> 02:14.586
[Narrator] Previously...

02:14.620 --> 02:15.793
[Man] Come on.

02:15.827 --> 02:18.896
Five teams set off
on their epic journey.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.034
[Jo] First checkpoint
is copan ruinas.

02:21.068 --> 02:24.137
[Sam] God, should have
gone to the toilet before starting.

02:24.172 --> 02:27.103
[Narrator] Mother and
son Jo and Sam raced hard.

02:27.137 --> 02:28.907
- [Sam] Why are you running?
- [Jo] I don't know.

02:28.931 --> 02:31.517
[Narrator]... to
reach copan ruinas

02:31.551 --> 02:33.241
ahead of the pack.

02:33.275 --> 02:34.689
[Jo] Oh, my god, we're first!

02:35.758 --> 02:36.941
[Narrator] ...With
a three-hour lead

02:36.965 --> 02:38.931
over bickering
brother and sister,

02:38.965 --> 02:40.482
dom and Lizzie.

02:40.517 --> 02:41.976
[Lizzie] Just let me
be angry sometimes.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.182
Have to pull ourselves together.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.206
But, dom, it's just frustrating.

02:45.241 --> 02:46.827
[Narrator] Despite
splashing the cash...

02:46.862 --> 02:48.517
- One sixty.
- [Eman] Yeah? Good one.

02:48.551 --> 02:51.034
Uncle and nephew eman and jamiul

02:51.068 --> 02:53.758
found themselves
high and dry in Belize...

02:53.793 --> 02:55.827
We don't have any more spaces.

02:55.862 --> 02:57.068
Oh, no.

02:57.103 --> 02:59.137
[Narrator] ...While for
Michael and shuntelle...

02:59.172 --> 03:02.310
Yes, I should've negotiated
straight around with you, but I didn't.

03:02.344 --> 03:03.562
[Narrator] ...And Jen and Rob...

03:03.586 --> 03:04.965
[Jen] It's gonna break me.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.275
A tropical storm
left them stranded

03:07.310 --> 03:08.793
just short of the checkpoint.

03:08.827 --> 03:10.793
I'm really dressed for
this type of weather.

03:10.827 --> 03:11.931
This is awful.

03:11.965 --> 03:14.137
I think we're just gonna
have to take the hit.

03:14.172 --> 03:15.310
[Thunder rumbling]

03:21.034 --> 03:22.554
[Narrator] With the
weather clearing...

03:23.413 --> 03:24.413
[Rob] Come on.

03:25.068 --> 03:26.000
Hola amigo.

03:26.034 --> 03:27.620
We're here to check in.

03:27.655 --> 03:29.655
[Narrator] Two more
teams reach the checkpoint.

03:29.689 --> 03:31.137
- Third.
- Oh!

03:31.172 --> 03:33.482
So pleased we've beat
Michael and shuntelle.

03:35.103 --> 03:37.068
[Jen] He's gonna be furious.

03:37.103 --> 03:38.241
[Rob] He's gonna be so mad.

03:38.275 --> 03:39.827
I can't wait to see their faces.

03:39.862 --> 03:41.344
- We're fourth.
- Fourth.

03:41.379 --> 03:42.275
Wow.

03:42.310 --> 03:44.413
- Not good enough.
- Yeah. Gutted.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.275
I know how he feels already.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.275
Um, nothing but
winning is best for him.

03:50.172 --> 03:52.000
[Narrator] While
the teams rest...

03:52.827 --> 03:54.551
One is still to arrive.

03:55.448 --> 03:56.655
Ha!

03:56.689 --> 03:59.758
[Narrator] Uncle and
nephew, eman and jamiul.

03:59.793 --> 04:02.862
Almost 33 hours
behind the leaders.

04:02.896 --> 04:04.551
Uh, clarion hotel?

04:04.586 --> 04:05.586
Good price?

04:07.172 --> 04:08.448
[Driver] Bueno. Muy bueno.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.413
[Driver continues in Spanish]

04:12.793 --> 04:14.793
[Eman] Hello there. Hola.

04:14.827 --> 04:16.747
- Can you please sign here?
- [Eman] Yes, we can.

04:17.379 --> 04:18.655
Do you know what's that?

04:20.034 --> 04:21.586
Damn.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.275
[Eman] Me and my uncle,
we're at bit of a disadvantage.

04:24.310 --> 04:26.137
We do know each other the least.

04:26.172 --> 04:27.482
I think we gotta think smart.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.758
I'm feeling eager and
ready to get into the next leg.

04:30.793 --> 04:32.103
We're not the underdogs.

04:32.137 --> 04:34.827
We're like Leicester city
when the won the premiership.

04:46.896 --> 04:48.172
Uh, we're leaving today.

04:48.206 --> 04:49.655
[Narrator] 6:00 am,

04:49.689 --> 04:51.379
teams can only
leave the checkpoint

04:51.413 --> 04:53.206
in the order they arrived.

04:53.241 --> 04:56.586
In first place, mother
and son, Jo and Sam.

04:56.620 --> 04:58.034
- Ah, Panama City.
- You're right.

04:58.793 --> 05:00.241
[Narrator] Panama City,

05:00.275 --> 05:03.344
a hub of international
banking and commerce,

05:03.379 --> 05:06.655
with its skyline of glass
and steel skyscrapers,

05:06.689 --> 05:09.275
and colonial old town
of cobblestone streets

05:09.310 --> 05:10.482
and crumbled ruins.

05:12.206 --> 05:15.655
To reach the second
checkpoint 1800 kilometers away,

05:15.689 --> 05:16.931
teams will have to travel

05:16.965 --> 05:19.896
through at least four
central American countries,

05:19.931 --> 05:22.724
navigating multiple
borders, currencies,

05:22.758 --> 05:25.000
cultures and customs.

05:26.551 --> 05:27.620
[Jo] Let's have a look...

05:28.310 --> 05:29.310
And plan.

05:30.724 --> 05:32.620
[Narrator] But first,
whether to travel

05:32.655 --> 05:35.206
through Honduras or El Salvador?

05:35.241 --> 05:36.517
If we go to El Salvador,

05:36.551 --> 05:37.689
we'll see more countries,

05:37.724 --> 05:39.275
'cause last time, we
missed out Belize.

05:39.896 --> 05:41.206
And El Salvador,

05:41.241 --> 05:42.827
it's untouched.

05:42.862 --> 05:44.275
We'll also see some wildlife.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.689
[Narrator] Jo and Sam's
detour through El Salvador

05:46.724 --> 05:49.413
will mean navigating
two extra borders,

05:49.448 --> 05:52.275
but with some of the fastest
roads in Central America,

05:52.310 --> 05:54.275
they could further
their advantage.

05:54.310 --> 05:57.344
First leg, I thought
we'd see more...

05:57.379 --> 05:58.310
[Sam] We did.

05:58.344 --> 06:00.275
Maybe we need
to look at our route

06:00.310 --> 06:02.137
and take in more things,

06:02.172 --> 06:03.413
but still race.

06:03.448 --> 06:04.517
[Sam] Are you ready?

06:05.241 --> 06:06.310
[Jo] No.

06:06.344 --> 06:08.965
The taxi is the clarion bus.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.137
[Sam] Yeah, well, get in.

06:10.965 --> 06:13.448
[Speaking Spanish]

06:14.551 --> 06:17.137
[Jo] Oh, god. Back
on the race. [Laughing]

06:20.103 --> 06:23.000
[Jo and man speaking Spanish]

06:28.862 --> 06:31.413
We're going on a bus
to San Salvador, direct.

06:33.689 --> 06:35.862
This is the most
uncomfortable seat.

06:39.448 --> 06:40.482
Hello.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.379
Her hands are so small.

06:44.413 --> 06:45.758
[Jo] Tiny hands.

06:45.793 --> 06:46.896
Your hands were...

06:46.931 --> 06:49.620
You were almost that
size when you were a baby.

06:49.655 --> 06:50.793
You know what they say, mom,

06:50.827 --> 06:52.310
big hands, big gloves.

06:53.172 --> 06:55.551
[Jo] Sam's always
wanted to travel,

06:55.586 --> 06:58.724
but he struggled
as a child with adhd.

06:58.758 --> 07:02.344
Basically, how it affects the
brain is the wiring is just off.

07:02.379 --> 07:05.551
Some connections
just don't connect.

07:05.586 --> 07:08.862
But he's now at a stage
where he can cope with that.

07:10.068 --> 07:11.620
Hopefully, he'll find the wings

07:11.655 --> 07:14.103
to carry on traveling himself,

07:14.137 --> 07:17.655
and I'm sure this will give
him confidence to do that.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.896
[Screeching]

07:20.931 --> 07:23.724
[Narrator] Two hours
from the El Salvador border,

07:23.758 --> 07:24.793
a problem.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.379
Ah, this is just
not what we need.

07:29.413 --> 07:31.586
[Sam] I've got a
hyperactive brain.

07:31.620 --> 07:32.758
It doesn't stop.

07:33.379 --> 07:34.310
I struggle to sleep.

07:34.344 --> 07:35.689
It takes me a
while to go to sleep

07:35.724 --> 07:38.137
at night as well,
because I'm now thinking

07:38.827 --> 07:40.344
constantly.

07:40.379 --> 07:42.793
Not about the right
stuff, about everything.

07:43.620 --> 07:44.827
Constantly thinking.

07:47.689 --> 07:49.896
Being through, like,
four, five schools,

07:49.931 --> 07:51.862
and, like, four colleges,

07:51.896 --> 07:53.862
most people call me an idiot,

07:53.896 --> 07:55.103
but you can say what you want.

07:55.137 --> 07:56.241
At the end of the day,

07:56.275 --> 07:58.896
you're not me and I'm
not you. We're all different.

07:58.931 --> 08:00.655
Yeah, I don't think
that looks too good.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.793
I did a level one
mechanics in college.

08:04.448 --> 08:05.448
Um...

08:07.034 --> 08:09.344
But it's obviously not working,

08:09.379 --> 08:11.620
because I've no clue
what's gone wrong.

08:12.862 --> 08:14.068
[Jo] Everything all right?

08:14.103 --> 08:15.137
Senor.

08:15.172 --> 08:16.793
- Yeah?
- [Man] Yes, yes, yes, yes.

08:16.827 --> 08:18.000
Good, good.

08:20.896 --> 08:22.068
[Dom] Panama City.

08:22.103 --> 08:23.517
- I know where that is.
- Yeah.

08:23.551 --> 08:25.413
[Narrator] Next to
leave the checkpoint,

08:25.448 --> 08:27.758
three and a half hours
behind the leaders,

08:27.793 --> 08:29.862
brother and sister,
dom and Lizzie.

08:29.896 --> 08:31.931
El Salvador sounds cool.

08:31.965 --> 08:33.517
It doesn't particularly
interest me.

08:33.551 --> 08:35.355
It's quite nice to go so
we're bit off to being in track.

08:35.379 --> 08:37.000
It's an extra border to cross.

08:37.034 --> 08:38.793
We should bypass El Salvador,

08:38.827 --> 08:40.551
and then arrive
in in Costa Rica,

08:40.586 --> 08:42.103
we can really enjoy ourselves.

08:42.137 --> 08:43.586
Taxi to copan ruinas.

08:44.655 --> 08:46.010
[Lizzie] It does
get really frustrating

08:46.034 --> 08:48.000
that dom dominates on situations

08:48.034 --> 08:49.586
and dominates our choices.

08:49.620 --> 08:51.793
And it's been like
this my whole life.

08:51.827 --> 08:53.620
He doesn't let me have my voice.

08:53.655 --> 08:56.793
[Narrator] Dom and Lizzie
have chosen to skip El Salvador.

08:56.827 --> 08:59.000
With no direct buses
through Honduras,

08:59.034 --> 09:01.379
they will need to bus
hop from village to village

09:01.413 --> 09:03.275
in order to reach Nicaragua.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.379
Do you know where
the bus station?

09:05.413 --> 09:07.206
Two corners, one block,

09:07.241 --> 09:09.206
- and... straight down.
- Straight down.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.793
So I thought the
driver said the bus is

09:12.827 --> 09:14.034
two blocks down...

09:14.068 --> 09:15.448
That's not what I heard.

09:15.482 --> 09:18.068
He said, two blocks
down, turn left,

09:18.103 --> 09:19.862
and then turn right,
and go straight down.

09:19.896 --> 09:21.896
- [Lizzie] Well, we'll see, won't we?
- Okay.

09:23.551 --> 09:25.586
[Lizzie] Dominic has
always relied on his charm.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.137
He gets away with murder.

09:27.172 --> 09:29.827
His friends can't believe the
amount of things he gets away with.

09:29.862 --> 09:32.931
The amount of people I've met being
like, "dom is such a wonderful boy.

09:32.965 --> 09:34.689
He's so lovely."
And I just think,

09:34.724 --> 09:36.068
you don't really
know dom, do you?

09:36.103 --> 09:38.275
11:50 or three o'clock.
We'll just have to ask.

09:38.310 --> 09:39.379
Hola.

09:40.172 --> 09:41.551
Um...

09:41.586 --> 09:43.206
- Is this an office?
- Si.

09:43.241 --> 09:47.724
We're trying to get a bus
to Santa Rosa De copan.

09:47.758 --> 09:49.172
[Speaking Spanish]

09:49.206 --> 09:51.103
- [Lizzie] Three o'clock.
- Two hundred.

09:53.620 --> 09:56.206
So that's now a four-hour wait.

10:01.793 --> 10:04.448
[Narrator] Jo and Sam
have arrived in El Salvador.

10:04.482 --> 10:05.586
[Sam] Bueno.

10:05.620 --> 10:06.862
[Jo] Muchas gracias.

10:06.896 --> 10:09.931
[Narrator] Years of civil
war and political unrest

10:09.965 --> 10:13.517
mean that El Salvador, the
smallest country in Central America,

10:13.551 --> 10:16.206
has remained largely
unknown to the outside world.

10:18.206 --> 10:20.586
But now, travelers are
beginning to discover

10:20.620 --> 10:23.137
its picture postcard
colonial towns

10:23.172 --> 10:24.758
and unspoiled beaches.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.344
[Jo speaking in Spanish]

10:35.793 --> 10:39.034
[Narrator] With a budget
of close to just £26 a day,

10:39.068 --> 10:40.241
the teams will need to work

10:40.275 --> 10:43.793
to earn extra cash to
make it to the ushuaia.

10:43.827 --> 10:46.068
[Jo] We've got ourselves
a job at the turtle sanctuary.

10:46.103 --> 10:48.931
I can't wait to see the turtles.

10:48.965 --> 10:50.631
[Narrator] Jo and Sam
have arranged to work

10:50.655 --> 10:52.482
at a hostel in El cuco

10:52.517 --> 10:55.034
on El Salvador's pacific coast.

10:55.068 --> 10:56.241
It will be really good.

10:56.275 --> 10:58.482
This is what this
trip's all about, isn't it?

11:02.172 --> 11:04.551
[Narrator] With the sea
turtle population under threat

11:04.586 --> 11:05.827
due to poaching,

11:05.862 --> 11:08.137
local projects like
this are trying to help

11:08.172 --> 11:10.000
with the survival
of the species.

11:10.034 --> 11:11.172
This is a frigatebird.

11:11.206 --> 11:14.413
Hi, honey. [Imitating bird call]

11:14.448 --> 11:16.724
They're met by Tom,
owner of the hostel.

11:18.172 --> 11:20.655
[Tom] Tonight, you're actually
going to go out on the beach

11:20.689 --> 11:22.068
where the turtle gathers.

11:22.103 --> 11:24.275
You're the first one
to grab those eggs

11:24.310 --> 11:26.724
- and you make, like, $30.
- [Jo] Oh, wow.

11:26.758 --> 11:29.724
[Tom] We buy more than
10,000 turtle eggs a year.

11:29.758 --> 11:31.896
[Jo] So what would happen
if you weren't buying them?

11:31.931 --> 11:33.596
They'd be taking them
down to the restaurants

11:33.620 --> 11:34.931
in El cuco and selling them.

11:34.965 --> 11:37.172
I've actually seen
people smuggling them

11:37.206 --> 11:38.655
into New York City.

11:41.241 --> 11:43.137
Oh, this guy knows
what he's doing.

11:43.172 --> 11:44.827
[Narrator] Before
joining the locals,

11:44.862 --> 11:47.758
who comb the beach at
night, collecting turtle eggs,

11:47.793 --> 11:49.862
Jo and Sam are put to work.

11:49.896 --> 11:51.044
[Tom] Should we
bring mom in there

11:51.068 --> 11:53.034
- for a couple slugs?
- [Sam] Yeah. [Laughing]

11:53.068 --> 11:56.172
At the moment, we're
chopping down a coconut tree,

11:56.206 --> 11:58.724
because they're going to
make a pathway down here.

11:59.482 --> 12:01.103
It's very hot, sweaty work.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.241
Sam's doing brilliantly.

12:03.275 --> 12:05.172
[Jo] I have a physical
job as a gardener.

12:05.965 --> 12:07.620
I love it.

12:07.655 --> 12:11.068
I burn off all of
my excess energy.

12:11.103 --> 12:12.551
[Jo] Go, Sam!

12:12.586 --> 12:14.862
[Sam] The only ways I
learn is being hands on.

12:14.896 --> 12:17.655
Like if you aren't good
in the education system

12:17.689 --> 12:19.103
or anything like that in school,

12:19.862 --> 12:21.344
just go be a builder.

12:21.379 --> 12:22.655
[Chuckling]

12:22.689 --> 12:23.689
[Sam] Give it a pull now.

12:26.275 --> 12:27.689
Whoo!

12:27.724 --> 12:29.896
[Tom] Whoo!

12:29.931 --> 12:31.689
- [Jo] Well done, Sam.
- Finally.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.034
[Narrator] 7:30 pm...

12:36.068 --> 12:38.137
Oh, hotel.

12:38.172 --> 12:40.965
[Narrator] Despite leaving
the checkpoint ten hours ago,

12:41.000 --> 12:43.379
dom and Lizzie have
traveled just 60 miles

12:43.413 --> 12:45.517
to Santa Rosa De copan.

12:45.551 --> 12:46.931
We'd like to say for one night,

12:46.965 --> 12:50.034
- but how much does it cost?
- [Speaking Spanish]

12:50.068 --> 12:52.068
- Lempiras? How much?
- How much lempiras?

12:52.103 --> 12:53.620
[In Spanish]

12:53.655 --> 12:55.482
- One room.
- One room.

12:57.551 --> 12:59.827
Can we use this... This pencil?

12:59.862 --> 13:02.379
He can write it down
without we asking.

13:02.413 --> 13:04.000
- So how...
- Oh, okay.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.594
- Just let me speak to him.
- All right.

13:06.620 --> 13:10.344
How many lempiras
for one bed, one night?

13:12.551 --> 13:14.551
- [Dom] Okay.
- [Lizzie] Four hundred.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.172
Do we have the change, sorry?

13:16.206 --> 13:18.206
[In Spanish]

13:18.241 --> 13:19.586
Uh...

13:19.620 --> 13:21.500
I feel like he's telling
they don't have change.

13:22.896 --> 13:25.655
Okay, well, then
we won't pay 500.

13:25.689 --> 13:28.413
[In Spanish]

13:31.137 --> 13:32.148
I do let you talk, Lizzie.

13:32.172 --> 13:33.724
I don't know why
you always say this.

13:33.758 --> 13:35.655
Sometimes in these
situations, I want...

13:35.689 --> 13:37.182
You know, I want
to have a say as well,

13:37.206 --> 13:38.286
so I just say let me speak.

13:38.310 --> 13:39.689
I don't mean it as in like...

13:39.724 --> 13:41.103
No, but you don't say that.

13:41.137 --> 13:43.724
You say, "dom, you always...
You never let me speak."

13:43.758 --> 13:44.838
You apply it to every situation.

13:44.862 --> 13:46.113
I feel like i'm
constantly dominated.

13:46.137 --> 13:48.379
- No, you make it out...
- But that's in your mind.

13:48.413 --> 13:49.793
No, it's not even the case.

13:49.827 --> 13:51.320
- You play that card...
- In your head.

13:51.344 --> 13:53.000
When we were younger,
we were so connected

13:53.034 --> 13:54.551
that we were like twins.

13:54.586 --> 13:55.724
[Dom] As we grew older,

13:55.758 --> 13:57.551
we're at each other's throats.

13:57.586 --> 14:00.724
And I don't feel like
since the age of 13 or 12

14:00.758 --> 14:02.827
that we've been even friends.

14:02.862 --> 14:04.241
Yeah, which is a massive shame.

14:04.275 --> 14:06.241
You are like you
always speak over me,

14:06.275 --> 14:08.241
- which is bollocks.
- All right.

14:08.275 --> 14:10.148
- Don't worry about that.
- You always play that card.

14:10.172 --> 14:11.827
Let's go find somewhere
else. Don't worry.

14:13.206 --> 14:14.551
[Dom] Always play that card.

14:17.448 --> 14:19.010
You just gets really
nasty sometimes, dom.

14:19.034 --> 14:20.034
It's unnecessary.

14:21.137 --> 14:22.655
[Dom] Okay, well...

14:22.689 --> 14:24.862
[Lizzie] No. I can't be
bothered. You're mean to me.

14:25.896 --> 14:27.413
When she says things like that,

14:27.448 --> 14:30.413
I always feel like

14:30.448 --> 14:33.655
I've really battered her
self-confidence here.

14:34.931 --> 14:37.206
Maybe if you weren't siblings,

14:37.241 --> 14:38.838
and you didn't have
that unconditional love,

14:38.862 --> 14:41.241
you wouldn't be able
to work things out

14:41.275 --> 14:43.344
after things go wrong.

14:43.379 --> 14:45.689
And I hope this
race can show that

14:45.724 --> 14:47.172
I do believe in her.

14:47.206 --> 14:49.827
She is capable, and
shouldn't doubt herself.

14:56.862 --> 14:58.206
We need to get the lights off

14:58.241 --> 14:59.941
because the turtles are
coming in to lay the eggs

14:59.965 --> 15:02.655
and they get frightened
away if they see the light.

15:02.689 --> 15:05.137
We're just standing back
to see if it comes in to land

15:05.172 --> 15:06.379
and lays the eggs.

15:06.413 --> 15:07.517
Please come in.

15:10.517 --> 15:13.172
Oh, there's a turtle, Sam.

15:13.931 --> 15:15.137
[Narrator] In El cuco,

15:15.172 --> 15:19.310
Jo and Sam's work
day is not yet done.

15:19.344 --> 15:23.034
- [Sam] So is it digging the hole, or...
- [Jo] It is covering the eggs.

15:23.068 --> 15:25.758
[Sam] Sea turtles spent
most of their lives in the ocean

15:25.793 --> 15:27.896
hundreds of
kilometers from shore.

15:27.931 --> 15:30.448
But every year,
thousands of females

15:30.482 --> 15:34.000
flocked to the beaches to
dig nests and lay their eggs.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.379
- [Sam] Having a right dance about it. Look.
- [Jo] Wow.

15:36.413 --> 15:39.174
[Sam] I've never dug turtle eggs,
so, like, so I don't wanna break any.

15:41.137 --> 15:42.310
Aww.

15:42.344 --> 15:45.344
[Speaking Spanish]

15:45.379 --> 15:48.965
It's amazing Sam, all these
eggs are going to be saved now.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.310
[Sam] Each person gets
fifteen bucks for the work today

15:52.344 --> 15:56.000
and these eggs we're going to
pay you three dollars a dozen.

15:56.517 --> 15:59.172
So a 102.

15:59.206 --> 16:00.758
[Sam] Create some
memories with my mom.

16:00.793 --> 16:04.931
It will be one of the best things. I'm
so happy to be doing it with my mom.

16:06.137 --> 16:08.482
It's what I'll be
able to live by

16:08.517 --> 16:12.689
and tell my kids when I go
traveling with them. [Chuckles]

16:12.724 --> 16:14.241
[Speaking Spanish]

16:14.275 --> 16:17.068
It's fantastic that, that can
pay for another two days

16:17.103 --> 16:19.551
travel and, um,
accommodation hopefully.

16:24.103 --> 16:26.793
[Narrator] 6am. Copan ruinas.

16:26.827 --> 16:31.551
[Rob] We have to travel
through Nicaragua and Costa Rica

16:31.586 --> 16:34.793
setting off 24 hours
behind the race leader's

16:34.827 --> 16:36.758
married couple, Jen and Rob.

16:36.793 --> 16:39.620
[Rob] We're gonna
skip El Salvador.

16:39.655 --> 16:42.655
[Jen] We'll never have this
chance to do it all over again.

16:42.689 --> 16:45.275
I did not appreciate
how hard it would be.

16:45.310 --> 16:48.551
You've got no money. You're starving,
you're tired in the middle of nowhere.

16:48.586 --> 16:49.931
You don't have a phone.

16:49.965 --> 16:51.344
We don't speak the language.

16:51.379 --> 16:53.310
It's pretty stressful.

16:53.344 --> 16:55.620
Remember when our shower
broke just before we came out?

16:55.655 --> 16:57.551
- Yeah.
- And you were devastated?

16:57.586 --> 16:59.758
Devastated? Yeah.

16:59.793 --> 17:02.586
I think after this experience,
it won't impact you so much.

17:02.620 --> 17:05.206
No, because I've gone four
days without changing my pants.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.655
What time do we leave?

17:08.655 --> 17:10.206
- [Speaks Spanish]
- [Jen] Oh, god.

17:10.241 --> 17:11.281
I don't know what that is.

17:13.724 --> 17:15.827
[Michael] Who do
you think [Indistinct]

17:15.862 --> 17:19.655
[Narrator] Hot on their heels,
rival couple Michael and shuntelle.

17:19.689 --> 17:22.620
[Shuntelle] I-I'm out of my comfort
zone more than I've ever been.

17:23.413 --> 17:24.379
I have to push more.

17:24.413 --> 17:25.896
And you have to
be more competitive.

17:25.931 --> 17:28.034
Yeah, I did... well, I'm
a competitive person.

17:28.758 --> 17:29.758
I have to woman up.

17:30.551 --> 17:31.689
Man up.

17:31.724 --> 17:34.103
I'm a woman. So,
I'm womaning up.

17:34.137 --> 17:39.172
So what do you think is [Indistinct]
by looking at [Indistinct] into Nicaragua.

17:39.206 --> 17:40.551
Yeah.

17:40.586 --> 17:43.758
[Narrator] With both couples
choosing to bus hop through Honduras

17:43.793 --> 17:46.862
the race is on to reach the
first town along the route.

17:46.896 --> 17:48.551
Santa Rosa De copan.

17:48.586 --> 17:51.758
[Shuntelle] Will we be able
to book a taxi to get to town?

17:51.793 --> 17:52.827
[Michael speaks Spanish]

17:52.862 --> 17:55.655
[Speaks Spanish]

17:55.689 --> 18:00.068
I've devoted my entire life to my
son and I've loved every moment of it.

18:00.103 --> 18:02.827
But he's now living his life.

18:02.862 --> 18:07.931
I've worked in a company for
nineteen years and i-I'm not fulfilled.

18:07.965 --> 18:12.206
I just want to see now what the
next forty years is for shuntelle.

18:13.586 --> 18:14.706
It's going to be busy, busy.

18:18.379 --> 18:19.655
They're here.

18:19.689 --> 18:22.275
They're on our bus. And
their only seats are next to me.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.896
Absolutely no way in hell.

18:23.931 --> 18:27.206
- What annoys you about them?
- It's a race. I'm spending

18:27.241 --> 18:28.275
all my time with them.

18:29.068 --> 18:30.965
Your seats are next to us.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
I'm sorry.

18:38.586 --> 18:40.793
This is the closest route.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.724
[Indistinct conversation]

18:53.793 --> 18:54.803
Have you chosen your room?

18:54.827 --> 18:58.655
- You don't say anything at all.
- [Laughs]

18:58.689 --> 19:01.793
- Have you chosen a room yet?
- No. No we haven't.

19:01.827 --> 19:04.620
- We have no idea where we are going.
- [Laughs]

19:04.655 --> 19:08.310
- Which way you going?
- That way.

19:10.793 --> 19:15.931
[Narrator] After three hours of an
uneasy truce, racing resumes in earnest.

19:15.965 --> 19:18.448
Ready to start asking questions.

19:18.482 --> 19:19.562
Don't mess with these guys.

19:21.551 --> 19:22.586
Yeah?

19:22.620 --> 19:25.034
[Speaking foreign language]

19:28.758 --> 19:31.758
Hello. Uh, we're trying
to get to Nicaragua.

19:31.793 --> 19:35.482
Want to at least be who we
left with today down the road?

19:35.517 --> 19:36.896
I don't. This is pointless.

19:36.931 --> 19:40.931
This is crazy, there's nothing
here. They can't be right.

19:41.655 --> 19:42.665
Look, there's still there.

19:42.689 --> 19:44.586
Just seeing face to face.

19:44.620 --> 19:46.310
It's about the petrol station.

19:46.344 --> 19:47.827
They are standing
there doing nothing.

19:49.172 --> 19:51.655
Uh, I don't know what to do.

19:51.689 --> 19:55.034
High five babe.
First leg of learning.

19:55.931 --> 19:58.206
I feel a little bit
more confident now.

19:59.896 --> 20:01.310
And I realized everybody else

20:01.344 --> 20:04.172
is actually serious about this
race, so I better get serious, too.

20:06.551 --> 20:08.068
I thought about
how awful this was.

20:18.965 --> 20:21.862
I've come out to
this beautiful beach

20:21.896 --> 20:26.413
and write my diary and
reflect on the journey so far.

20:26.448 --> 20:29.551
And I think something
about the turtles last night.

20:29.586 --> 20:32.241
And obviously the turtles
cannot protect the young.

20:32.275 --> 20:38.241
They Bury the eggs and the
eggs are left, and I suppose it was

20:40.482 --> 20:42.793
a link really there with some?

20:42.827 --> 20:47.103
Um, we adopted him
when he was six months old.

20:47.137 --> 20:49.896
We already had a birth
child. And Charlie, he was

20:49.931 --> 20:53.620
he was three years old and
you have that immediate bond.

20:53.655 --> 20:56.172
And of course, it's different
with an adopted children.

20:56.206 --> 21:00.586
You do worry you get to that
point of loving them in that way.

21:02.827 --> 21:08.862
It's time I realized how much I loved
him was when he was over a year old

21:08.896 --> 21:13.034
and the horrible Tsunami in
Southeast Asia happens on.

21:13.068 --> 21:17.827
I remember reading about this story
of a mother with two children, and she

21:17.862 --> 21:24.241
she couldn't hold on to both children,
and she had to decide which one to let go.

21:26.137 --> 21:28.896
I had nightmares
about it at no point

21:28.931 --> 21:31.482
because I let go of either
of them, and it was that.

21:35.758 --> 21:41.620
I realized I love them both
equally and and he's totally mine.

21:41.655 --> 21:42.758
He's totally mine.

21:45.275 --> 21:49.551
It's lovely, proud, and I'm so
pleased we're in this journey together.

21:55.103 --> 21:58.862
-It's paradise, -and it
just feels so peaceful.

21:58.896 --> 22:02.689
It's a great feeling to
know that a 102 turtles

22:02.724 --> 22:04.241
andare going to be released back

22:04.275 --> 22:07.896
- back into the sea.
- They never even with their parents.

22:07.931 --> 22:09.896
You're 19 and still at home.

22:09.931 --> 22:11.793
I want you to be there
forever is you know,

22:11.827 --> 22:14.000
because I know
you'll leave sometime.

22:14.034 --> 22:17.000
- I'm planning on leaving when I got back.
- All right, okay.

22:22.620 --> 22:24.551
[Narrator] For emon and jamiul

22:24.586 --> 22:26.931
do you know where the map is?
Have you checked everywhere?

22:26.965 --> 22:29.517
Officials say it's been lost.

22:29.551 --> 22:34.655
[Narrator] Being last to leave 30 hours
behind the leaders isn't their only concern.

22:34.689 --> 22:39.103
It would be better for us to have a
map, you know, a bit of a disadvantage.

22:39.137 --> 22:41.000
Panama City. Here we come.

22:42.206 --> 22:44.758
Nicaragua. I've never
heard of that country.

22:44.793 --> 22:50.000
Costa Rica got good
football team El Salvador...

22:50.034 --> 22:52.379
This will be a good time to
get the map out, wouldn't it?

22:52.413 --> 22:56.034
After ten years apart due
to a family estrangement,

22:56.068 --> 22:59.103
emon and jamiul
have only just reunited.

22:59.137 --> 23:01.000
He's always been my favorite.

23:01.034 --> 23:03.965
You know, people shouldn't say
that that you have a favorite nephew.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.413
But when he was a little kid,
he always had that, not listening.

23:07.448 --> 23:09.000
Cross, cross, cross.

23:09.034 --> 23:11.137
From now on, he get his
own. He's a grown man.

23:11.172 --> 23:12.172
You got it, my friend.

23:13.172 --> 23:15.448
Every time I've asked
my mom or my family

23:15.482 --> 23:18.482
where he is kind of just
brushed it off to the side

23:18.517 --> 23:22.000
after asking so many times,
he's kind of no, you know what?

23:22.034 --> 23:24.000
Nobody wants to
answer your questions.

23:24.034 --> 23:29.931
Let's get there and then we'll
decide where to go from there.

23:29.965 --> 23:33.344
We're hoping that this trip will be
a good way for me to understand

23:33.379 --> 23:35.689
why he made those
decisions to leave.

23:35.724 --> 23:38.448
You need to have a battle on
the funding of where we're going.

23:43.862 --> 23:46.275
Going for a slow release
in porridge for breakfast

23:47.931 --> 23:50.551
[narrator] 224 kilometers away.

23:50.586 --> 23:56.000
Michael and shuntelle are pushing on with
their plan of bus hoping through Honduras.

23:56.034 --> 24:00.000
We've got a bus now that's going in
about 10 minutes t o, um, camaguey.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.137
- How much was it?
- 20.

24:04.206 --> 24:06.551
[Indistinct conversation]

24:06.586 --> 24:07.931
You could do it today.

24:07.965 --> 24:09.793
I'm sure it's exciting.

24:10.793 --> 24:12.344
I joined the
military very young.

24:12.379 --> 24:15.724
It gives you confidence and
it gives you an understanding

24:15.758 --> 24:17.206
of the world in
different people.

24:17.241 --> 24:18.241
When is he leaving?

24:18.655 --> 24:19.793
You need to go fast.

24:19.827 --> 24:22.275
- [Speaks Spanish]
- 10 minutes

24:22.310 --> 24:23.862
thank you.

24:23.896 --> 24:28.344
During his trips about exploring
adventure to strengthen out relationship.

24:28.379 --> 24:29.827
This will make or break us.

24:29.862 --> 24:34.172
- And Mateo? Number eight.
- Eight.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.862
- You had to pay for them?
- Here.

24:39.137 --> 24:41.137
Oh, my god. My
money belt is here isn't?

24:41.172 --> 24:43.137
I can't see a money belt, no.

24:43.172 --> 24:45.931
- Where's my money belt?
- I don't know. I can't see it.

24:46.517 --> 24:47.793
Nothing at all?

24:48.517 --> 24:49.689
There's nothing on you.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.000
Where's the bus
that you just got on.

24:59.344 --> 25:00.689
Back pocket?

25:00.724 --> 25:05.758
-It's not here definitely -Michael
can't find his money wallet.

25:05.793 --> 25:08.655
I don't know what he did with it.
He went and bought some food.

25:08.689 --> 25:11.137
I came here this morning.

25:11.689 --> 25:12.689
I lost one.

25:13.103 --> 25:14.103
Have you seen?

25:14.379 --> 25:15.379
Yeah?

25:18.344 --> 25:19.413
It's all good here.

25:26.241 --> 25:28.172
- I think we've done all we can.
- Yeah.

25:28.724 --> 25:29.724
It's gone babe.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.241
Got it. Got it for myself.

25:33.275 --> 25:36.379
Got it for him. We're
are handicapped.

25:36.413 --> 25:40.310
It was already a limited budget to
start with then to half the budget.

25:40.344 --> 25:42.724
Wow is not possible.

25:47.448 --> 25:49.793
Eight, nine and ten.

25:52.172 --> 25:55.931
[Narrator] For Michael and shuntelle
account of their depleted funds.

25:55.965 --> 25:58.137
1236.

25:59.310 --> 26:01.068
We lost over a 1000 pounds.

26:02.206 --> 26:04.620
Starting the day with
over 2000 pounds,

26:04.655 --> 26:08.620
they have lost 1155 pounds

26:08.655 --> 26:11.310
over 50 percent of
the remaining budget.

26:11.344 --> 26:13.517
That's a lot of
money and it's gone.

26:13.551 --> 26:15.931
[Indistinct conversation]

26:15.965 --> 26:18.896
Yeah, it's sad said.

26:18.931 --> 26:20.137
Today has been a tough day.

26:21.310 --> 26:24.896
Highs and lows, very
lows today on certain.

26:24.931 --> 26:28.379
- Sadly.
- You're getting used to the idea and I messed up.

26:28.413 --> 26:29.793
I'm sorry.

26:32.655 --> 26:34.896
But we're gonna keep on racing.

26:34.931 --> 26:37.000
And do what we do.
Up again tomorrow.

26:37.758 --> 26:38.758
And on with the race.

26:43.517 --> 26:44.517
Nice to meet you.

26:46.310 --> 26:47.590
Beautiful place
you got here man.

26:47.620 --> 26:48.793
Yeah, very nice.

26:48.827 --> 26:51.137
- Really like it.
- [Narrator] Just under 100 kilometers

26:51.172 --> 26:54.344
from copan, ruinous
and the last place.

26:54.379 --> 26:56.482
Emon and jamiul are yet
to come up with a route.

26:57.862 --> 27:00.206
We're on very,
very limited budget?

27:07.103 --> 27:09.172
Food tastes even
better when it's free.

27:09.206 --> 27:12.000
You don't pay for something
it's something magical.

27:12.034 --> 27:15.241
I've had a lot of burgers in my
life but, that's the best burger man.

27:15.275 --> 27:17.827
- Yeah.
- A great guy.

27:17.862 --> 27:19.275
And he didn't
have to help us out.

27:19.310 --> 27:21.562
It just shows you, you know,
there are good people in this world.

27:21.586 --> 27:23.724
Who're willing to help you.

27:23.758 --> 27:28.551
We need to get to the
border as fast as possible.

27:29.172 --> 27:31.206
There is a fastest road

27:31.241 --> 27:37.586
- on central to South America over that one.
- [Indistinct chatter]

27:37.620 --> 27:42.000
You got to get to Salvador
first, capital of San Salvador.

27:42.034 --> 27:45.931
Allen's suggestion to head through
El Salvador on it's faster roads

27:45.965 --> 27:49.379
means they could make
up much needed time.

27:49.413 --> 27:53.413
We plan to change the route that we
go take tomorrow is a more faster route.

27:53.448 --> 27:59.000
Got the three factors budget,
speed... Budget speed and...

28:08.172 --> 28:13.965
We got two functions.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.448
El Salvador.

28:20.482 --> 28:25.344
Oh, my days, this
people know how to grill

28:25.379 --> 28:28.689
[narrator] As emon and jamiul
cross the border into El Salvador.

28:29.965 --> 28:32.862
- You just can't hitchike around, can you?
- No.

28:32.896 --> 28:34.896
Approaching the
Nicaraguan border.

28:34.931 --> 28:36.793
Michael and
shuntelle are learning

28:36.827 --> 28:39.551
some of the pitfalls of
traveling at ground level.

28:40.586 --> 28:44.034
There are huge
potholes on the road

28:44.965 --> 28:46.034
and our driver.

28:47.862 --> 28:50.143
There's a pothole coming up
ket's get that one mate. Go on.

28:53.896 --> 28:56.448
Someone's become a
bit travel sick on the bus.

28:56.482 --> 28:58.068
[Narrator] Hot on their heels,

28:58.103 --> 29:03.482
Jen and Rob are also experiencing
the winding mountain roads of Honduras.

29:03.517 --> 29:07.206
If anything's gonna trick
Jen off, this is probably it.

29:07.241 --> 29:09.275
Just hold back a sec.

29:09.310 --> 29:11.724
Oh, she just got of
the bus. Oh my days.

29:13.068 --> 29:14.793
Why didn't this
country have trains?

29:20.620 --> 29:22.241
[Narrator] While in El Salvador,

29:22.275 --> 29:26.379
Jo and Sam are sharing their bus with
more unusual travel companions so much

29:26.413 --> 29:28.000
[Sam] Oh, my god.

29:33.206 --> 29:37.517
I've seen some stuff in my
past. I've never seen that before.

29:40.103 --> 29:42.482
It's not the fastest
bus in the world.

29:43.379 --> 29:44.448
[Narrator] For one team,

29:44.482 --> 29:47.758
their strategy of back to
back buses has paid off.

29:47.793 --> 29:50.793
Dom and Lizzie are the
first to set foot in, Nicaragua.

29:53.413 --> 29:54.965
These chicken
buses in Nicaragua.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.793
Absolutely bonkers
people preaching,

29:57.827 --> 30:01.896
selling, talking about sexual
health. It's just totally mental.

30:05.413 --> 30:07.965
[Narrator] Nicaragua
suffered a series of civil wars

30:08.000 --> 30:11.482
in the 1980's that
only ended in 1990.

30:11.517 --> 30:15.896
With the Democratic election of the
first female president in the Americas.

30:17.517 --> 30:20.931
A place of outstanding
natural beauty.

30:20.965 --> 30:26.344
It's home to Central America's
largest lake and 19 active volcanoes,

30:26.379 --> 30:28.965
which run down the
spine of the country.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.172
We're heading towards the Costa
Rican border at penny's blankers,

30:33.206 --> 30:36.137
so hopefully we'll be able to
cross into Costa Rican tonight.

30:36.172 --> 30:38.092
That means you smashed
two countries in two days.

30:42.655 --> 30:44.206
Can anyone do better than this?

30:44.241 --> 30:46.034
We'll take the cheapest one.

30:46.068 --> 30:49.275
Also newly arrived in
Nicaragua, Jen and Rob

30:49.310 --> 30:52.965
have reached the former capital
and second largest city mausoleo.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.482
This is gonna be so heavy
how are you gonna do this?

30:57.517 --> 31:00.000
This easy, like bicycle.

31:01.379 --> 31:05.379
I felt like a gigantic
fatty is right now.

31:05.413 --> 31:08.068
But we're going to spend
some time in the city,

31:08.103 --> 31:12.482
have a little bit of downtime in
mausoleo, it's a bit impulsive.

31:12.517 --> 31:16.551
Long established is the intellectual
and political heart of the country.

31:16.586 --> 31:19.344
The city is steeped in
revolutionary history,

31:19.379 --> 31:23.103
with murals around every
corner depicting fallen heros.

31:23.137 --> 31:25.482
It is impressive
someone painted this.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.586
To do with war,
definitely in bloodshed.

31:28.793 --> 31:30.758
[Narrator] At the
heart of the city,

31:30.793 --> 31:33.793
the basilica built in the 1700's

31:35.344 --> 31:37.137
is this a black Jesus?

31:39.482 --> 31:43.379
Why this small city in Nicaragua
is home to the largest cathedral

31:43.413 --> 31:46.034
in Central America
remains a mystery.

31:46.068 --> 31:48.482
Some see there was
a mix up with plans

31:48.517 --> 31:51.827
and that this magnificent
structure should in fact be in Lima,

31:51.862 --> 31:53.103
the capital of Peru.

31:53.137 --> 31:55.241
I feel really, really behind.

31:55.275 --> 31:57.517
We need to switch
off from the race a little.

31:57.551 --> 32:00.448
Bit, otherwise it
becomes all consuming.

32:00.482 --> 32:02.586
Just try and enjoy this time.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.137
Can I keep my
feelings to myself?

32:06.758 --> 32:11.827
I think this journey would be a
great opportunity for us to reconnect.

32:11.862 --> 32:16.413
I feel I'm a slightly different person
after and losing most my hearing.

32:16.448 --> 32:22.103
And I think we don't have the
same relationship as we did before.

32:22.137 --> 32:23.758
[Jen] Definitely not.

32:23.793 --> 32:27.827
Just want to remember why
we fell in love in the first place.

32:27.862 --> 32:29.907
Just hope that we start to
relax and have a bit of fun.

32:29.931 --> 32:32.068
Enjoy each other's company
more than we do now.

32:32.103 --> 32:34.448
Yeah.

32:34.482 --> 32:36.103
[Jen] To stop
thinking about the race

32:36.137 --> 32:39.137
cos robie says, "it's not
all about the race, Jen."

32:40.620 --> 32:44.413
But as of this day, we're
probably in a worse-off space

32:44.448 --> 32:49.172
becaue the pressure is not allowing
us that time to sit back and enjoy.

32:49.206 --> 32:51.862
If anything, I'm probaly
the worst person.

32:51.896 --> 32:55.275
I speak before I
think. That's a fault.

32:55.310 --> 32:58.379
But it's never from a place...
I'm not a horrible person.

32:58.413 --> 33:00.103
It's always from
a place of love.

33:00.137 --> 33:01.896
It's 'cause I care
about something

33:01.931 --> 33:05.344
or because it has, you know,
an affect on my emotions.

33:05.379 --> 33:07.482
I'm never just a...

33:08.896 --> 33:11.137
- There's the bell going.
- Where?

33:11.172 --> 33:12.172
There.

33:12.206 --> 33:16.137
[Bell tolling]

33:16.758 --> 33:18.172
Tore my hearing aid off.

33:21.275 --> 33:24.034
[Jen] I know that robie is an
angel fir putitng up with Vic.

33:24.068 --> 33:26.448
It's just a high-pressured
environment.

33:26.482 --> 33:31.137
Like, I'm doing my best. And
as time goes on, it will get easier.

33:34.862 --> 33:38.034
[Rob] Oh, there's two
volcanoes over there.

33:38.068 --> 33:40.000
[Jen] We need to crack on.

33:42.586 --> 33:45.206
- [Dom] Look at that over there.
- [Lizzie] It's amazing.

33:45.241 --> 33:47.482
Deep, deep into this jungle.

33:47.517 --> 33:50.655
[Narrator] After a non-stop journey
through Honduras and Nicaragua,

33:50.689 --> 33:52.724
brother and sister
dom and Lizzie

33:52.758 --> 33:55.586
are the first team to
cross into Costa Rica,

33:55.620 --> 33:58.862
extending their lead
by over 400 kilometers.

33:58.896 --> 34:01.448
This is what we've been
traveling for four days for,

34:01.482 --> 34:03.517
and now we're finally here.

34:03.551 --> 34:05.862
I am absolutely shattered.

34:05.896 --> 34:09.689
Really need just to stop
somewhere and actually enjoy it.

34:12.724 --> 34:15.344
Narrator: The most visited
country in Central America,

34:15.379 --> 34:19.862
Costa Rica attracts over
2 million tourists each year.

34:19.896 --> 34:22.758
This tiny, peace-loving
nation has no army,

34:22.793 --> 34:26.586
and is home to 5% of
the world's biodiversity,

34:26.620 --> 34:29.586
including 52 species
of hummingbird.

34:31.655 --> 34:33.379
Vamos.

34:33.413 --> 34:35.827
[Narrator] The siblings
have arrived in limon,

34:35.862 --> 34:38.000
on the country's
Caribbean coast,

34:38.034 --> 34:40.068
home to the bribri tribe.

34:40.103 --> 34:43.275
An indigenous people
native to Costa Rica.

34:43.310 --> 34:46.103
Their primary
focus is agriculture.

34:46.137 --> 34:48.862
In order to help preserve
their way of living,

34:48.896 --> 34:51.689
farms like this invite
volunteers to work

34:51.724 --> 34:53.724
in exchange for bed and board.

34:53.758 --> 34:56.965
[In Spanish]

34:57.000 --> 34:59.044
- [Dom] So we're gonna help you work?
- [Woman] Uh-huh.

34:59.068 --> 35:00.586
[Oinks]

35:00.620 --> 35:02.586
- [Lizzie] I can hear pigs.
- [Dom snarls]

35:02.620 --> 35:04.448
[Lizzie] It smells. [Chuckles]

35:04.482 --> 35:07.241
- [Pigs snarling]
- [Lizzie] It's smelling me.

35:07.275 --> 35:08.689
[Giggles]

35:08.724 --> 35:10.241
[Lizzie] I can't deal with that.

35:10.758 --> 35:12.793
[Dom] Come on.

35:13.586 --> 35:15.310
Get all the poo.

35:16.586 --> 35:18.344
- Here?
- [Dom] Yeah.

35:18.379 --> 35:21.000
- [Dom] She doesn't mind getting dirty.
- [Retches]

35:21.965 --> 35:24.241
- [Lizzie] Oh, my god. Dom.
- [Dom grunts]

35:24.275 --> 35:27.517
Aww. I'm gonna call you "babe".

35:27.551 --> 35:29.965
I think dom and the pig
have a lot in common.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.034
The way they smell,
the way they eat.

35:33.068 --> 35:35.275
General behavior.

35:37.275 --> 35:38.517
[Woman] She's my mom.

35:38.551 --> 35:41.103
- Me llamodominic.
- Mauricia.

35:41.137 --> 35:43.310
[Narrator] The bribri
are a matriarchal society

35:43.344 --> 35:46.689
with their own language,
traditions and culture.

35:47.896 --> 35:52.068
[In Spanish]

35:59.448 --> 36:02.379
- [Dom] It's all about unity in your family.
- [Woman] Yeah, it is.

36:02.413 --> 36:06.344
We're brother and sister,
and as we got older,

36:06.379 --> 36:08.172
we went apart,

36:08.206 --> 36:11.551
and we're trying to come
back together. [Chuckles]

36:12.517 --> 36:14.206
[In Spanish]

36:14.241 --> 36:16.896
[Humming]

36:21.000 --> 36:23.206
[Continues humming]

36:24.724 --> 36:26.758
[Shrieking]

36:29.448 --> 36:32.413
When we spend too much
time together, we... we clash.

36:32.448 --> 36:33.655
[Both chuckle]

36:33.689 --> 36:36.000
And I think part
of this experience

36:36.034 --> 36:39.862
- is sort of trying to be close again.
- Mm-hm.

36:39.896 --> 36:41.896
[In Spanish]

36:43.344 --> 36:45.172
Staying together and
seeing each other often

36:45.206 --> 36:47.517
and speaking often and
communication is so important.

36:47.551 --> 36:50.862
I think that's something dom and I
both lack. We don't talk to each other.

36:50.896 --> 36:53.241
Family relationship should
be a friend relationship, too.

36:53.275 --> 36:55.241
You want to spend
time with them, not...

36:55.275 --> 36:57.275
- "I have to." It's not a chore.
-Yeah.

36:57.310 --> 36:59.551
- Aww.
- [Chuckles]

36:59.586 --> 37:02.379
[Laughing]

37:02.413 --> 37:05.206
[Woman] They told
me they are not friends.

37:05.241 --> 37:07.965
But I saw... work together,

37:08.000 --> 37:10.689
and they are friend,
they are happy.

37:10.724 --> 37:13.482
[Lizzie] I heard some
weird-sounding bugs. I'm really scared.

37:13.517 --> 37:15.689
[Dom] You know, there's
a mosquito inside your net.

37:15.724 --> 37:17.344
- What?
- Look.

37:17.379 --> 37:20.000
- No.
- [Dom laughs]

37:20.034 --> 37:21.689
You just got punk'd.

37:26.724 --> 37:27.896
[Horn toots]

37:27.931 --> 37:30.137
Narrator: Concerned
about their budget,

37:30.172 --> 37:34.172
emon and jamiul have
stopped off in Leon, Nicaragua.

37:34.206 --> 37:35.827
- Start anywhere.
- Si.

37:35.862 --> 37:38.517
[Narrator] Using the directory
of local job opportunities

37:38.551 --> 37:40.000
given to all teams,

37:40.034 --> 37:41.896
they've picked up
work washing buses.

37:41.931 --> 37:44.068
We've got a lot to cover, man.

37:44.103 --> 37:47.000
You could do a
jet wash here, lad.

37:47.034 --> 37:49.655
In car-washing, the wheels
are the most important.

37:49.689 --> 37:52.827
If the wheel looks
good, the car looks clean.

37:52.862 --> 37:56.137
[Narrator] Automotive
maintenance is right up emon's street.

37:56.172 --> 38:00.068
He's built a string of successful
businesses out of it back in the UK.

38:00.103 --> 38:01.689
[Emon] I've always
worked for myself.

38:01.724 --> 38:04.000
When I was 15, I used to
go to the local market store,

38:04.034 --> 38:05.631
and I used to sell
anything and everything.

38:05.655 --> 38:08.206
And I sold them all, one
pound each. Absolutely flew out.

38:08.241 --> 38:11.137
This is actually a
carpet to make car mats.

38:11.172 --> 38:13.206
When I first made car mats,

38:13.241 --> 38:14.551
I made them with my bare hands,

38:14.586 --> 38:16.172
and I sold them
with my bare hands.

38:16.206 --> 38:19.103
These are mine.

38:19.137 --> 38:21.620
I started selling them online.

38:21.655 --> 38:24.310
Later, I got my foot in
the automotive industry.

38:24.344 --> 38:26.103
And this is the
empire that I've built.

38:27.655 --> 38:29.448
After I finished university,

38:29.482 --> 38:32.620
I had aspirations of
becoming an entrepreneur,

38:32.655 --> 38:34.344
to own my own business.

38:34.379 --> 38:38.965
Eh, to follow my dreams about traveling
and creating adventures for myself.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.827
My father was in
the mind that I'll go

38:41.862 --> 38:44.379
and to a 9 to 5 job,
have a stable income,

38:44.413 --> 38:47.000
I'll get married a couple of
years later, have a few kids,

38:47.034 --> 38:48.448
and that'll be me,

38:48.482 --> 38:50.448
and I'll be set up
in Manchester.

38:50.482 --> 38:52.344
My ideas were
completely different.

38:52.379 --> 38:53.724
I wanted to take risks.

38:53.758 --> 38:58.413
My father didn't appreciate
the decisions that I wanted to do.

38:58.448 --> 39:02.275
So I left Manchester
when I was 20 years old.

39:02.310 --> 39:06.103
In terms of jamiul's family
and my older cousins,

39:06.137 --> 39:07.896
I sort of lost touch
of everybody.

39:07.931 --> 39:10.172
In a sense, they
forgot about me.

39:12.758 --> 39:14.896
We didn't get the bus there.

39:14.931 --> 39:17.000
[Jamiul] My uncle is
driven, he's focused.

39:17.034 --> 39:20.068
If he wants something, he'll
go out there and try to achieve it.

39:20.103 --> 39:23.551
I don't know if he's, uh, doing
a good job on the windows.

39:23.586 --> 39:24.689
The dirt's from inside.

39:24.724 --> 39:26.482
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah.

39:26.517 --> 39:27.931
He's quite an inspiration to me.

39:27.965 --> 39:30.068
He owns his own
business, and he's traveled,

39:30.103 --> 39:32.724
and maybe I can
learn quite a bit off him

39:32.758 --> 39:35.517
to maybe help me go
forward in my future.

39:35.551 --> 39:36.862
Clean the top of that.

39:36.896 --> 39:38.493
Just all the way down
there. Just wipe it down.

39:38.517 --> 39:42.034
When you're washing cars, you just
clean the best part people can see.

39:42.068 --> 39:43.896
That sounds like the way to go.

39:43.931 --> 39:45.758
Worked my way from
the front to the back,

39:45.793 --> 39:47.724
sweeping the floors.

39:47.758 --> 39:50.241
Not sure if he's cutting
corners or did a full whack up.

39:50.275 --> 39:52.931
Most likely he did a full whack.

39:52.965 --> 39:55.034
[Jamiul] You should always
work as hard as possible

39:55.068 --> 39:57.068
or do the best
of your abilities.

39:58.413 --> 39:59.872
I guess he hasn't
been in my life too much

39:59.896 --> 40:01.724
to realize the hustle I am.

40:01.758 --> 40:02.862
I don't know.

40:02.896 --> 40:04.827
Oh, this, you don't need to do.

40:04.862 --> 40:06.907
[Jamiul] I don't think my uncle's
put in too much hard work.

40:06.931 --> 40:08.458
I think he's been
dossing about, to be fair.

40:08.482 --> 40:10.517
Only the top room needs doing.

40:10.551 --> 40:12.310
He's just been a
boss for so long,

40:12.344 --> 40:16.344
I don't think he knows how to
go back to just being a worker.

40:16.862 --> 40:18.620
Oh.

40:18.655 --> 40:21.344
[Both speaking in Spanish]

40:21.379 --> 40:22.931
- Gracias.
- Gracias, gracias.

40:22.965 --> 40:24.482
Thank you, thank you.

40:24.517 --> 40:26.379
[Man] Buen viaje.

40:28.862 --> 40:30.665
[Shuntelle] Ready,
babe? Let's get out of here.

40:30.689 --> 40:33.655
[Narrator] Michael and shuntelle
have also made it to Nicaragua,

40:33.689 --> 40:36.379
but with funds
seriously depleted.

40:36.413 --> 40:39.241
We, um, had a bit
of a chat last night.

40:39.275 --> 40:41.655
We are still racing,
we are still in it.

40:41.689 --> 40:44.655
We are thinking just
to head straight out

40:44.689 --> 40:46.068
to Costa Rica.

40:46.103 --> 40:48.172
I've always wanted to visit.

40:48.206 --> 40:50.448
Everybody talks
how amazing it is.

40:50.827 --> 40:52.758
Hey.

40:52.793 --> 40:55.034
[Narrator] Boarding a bus
to the capital, Managua...

40:55.068 --> 40:57.034
How are you doing?

40:57.068 --> 40:58.586
[Narrator] ...Two competitors.

40:59.965 --> 41:02.482
[Narrator] Jo and Sam's
decision to work in El cuco

41:02.517 --> 41:06.965
means Michael and shuntelle have
closed the 24-hour gap between them.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.551
- [Michael] It's good to see their faces.
- Yeah, definitely.

41:09.586 --> 41:11.862
[Michael] They left over
24 hours ahead of us.

41:11.896 --> 41:13.379
But we're not gonna
let anyone know

41:13.413 --> 41:15.206
about my massive mistake.

41:15.241 --> 41:16.931
- [Shuntelle] The race.
- The race is on.

41:16.965 --> 41:18.482
The animosity is on.

41:18.517 --> 41:20.551
Let me see them, and then...

41:20.586 --> 41:23.965
Reassure 'cause it does
appear that we're last.

41:26.344 --> 41:28.379
- See you around, guys.
- See you.

41:29.344 --> 41:31.103
[In Spanish]

41:34.206 --> 41:36.586
[Vendor speaking in Spanish]

41:39.275 --> 41:41.793
[Narrator] With
temperatures soaring...

41:41.827 --> 41:44.275
It's just too hot
to keep doing this.

41:45.068 --> 41:48.172
Feels about 45 degrees.

41:48.206 --> 41:50.586
[Narrator] Back-to-back
travel is getting to Sam.

41:54.724 --> 41:57.000
[Sam] I've got a limit on
how much heat I could take.

41:57.034 --> 41:59.793
If I can't do it, I'm just
gonna go fly home.

41:59.827 --> 42:01.896
Let's see if we can get...

42:01.931 --> 42:04.965
See nothing, mom. It's gonna
be the same the whole time.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.310
[Jo] We can try and get...

42:06.344 --> 42:08.458
Stop trying to come up with
excuses saying, "we'll see."

42:08.482 --> 42:09.724
I'm not, sweetie, darling.

42:09.758 --> 42:11.424
- Yes, you are.
- We can try and get airconditioned buses.

42:11.448 --> 42:13.941
I know the countries are hot,
but I didn't think it'd be this hot.

42:13.965 --> 42:16.793
Like, this is just ridiculous.

42:16.827 --> 42:18.172
Sorry, love.

42:19.448 --> 42:22.241
Sam's struggling with the heat,

42:22.275 --> 42:25.620
and somewhat takes it
out on me, which is fine.

42:25.655 --> 42:28.827
The best way to do is sit back
and let him work his way through it.

42:28.862 --> 42:31.482
If you start questioning him,

42:31.517 --> 42:34.379
it can really downward spiral.

42:34.413 --> 42:37.275
- [Sam] It's just too hot.
- Okay.

42:37.310 --> 42:39.896
[Jo] We get airconditioned
coaches and...

42:39.931 --> 42:43.724
The only thing I can do to try
and make his journey easier,

42:43.758 --> 42:46.448
I will try and do. [Chuckles]

42:48.344 --> 42:49.965
I'll give you 50. There you go.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.379
That's 2 quid. Just
don't spend it all.

42:52.413 --> 42:55.586
I don't take many
frustrations out on my mom.

42:55.620 --> 43:01.068
But I know that when I do,
we can make up afterwards.

43:01.103 --> 43:03.137
Can I have the crisps?

43:03.172 --> 43:04.965
She's my mom.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.103
She knows me and I know
her, and she's brought me up

43:08.137 --> 43:10.517
since I was six months.

43:10.551 --> 43:15.413
I've never gone out my way to
find out who my birth mother is...

43:15.448 --> 43:17.034
Muchas gracias.

43:17.068 --> 43:22.413
Because it's quite a warm feeling
to know that you're definitely special

43:22.448 --> 43:24.689
in the way that
you've been chosen.

43:24.724 --> 43:27.620
[Speaking in Spanish]

43:32.689 --> 43:35.241
[Jamiul] We need to get to
Panama as quickly as possible.

43:35.275 --> 43:36.586
Today.

43:36.620 --> 43:39.931
[Narrator] In last place, emon
and jamiul have found a bus

43:39.965 --> 43:43.482
which could take them all
the way to David in Panama.

43:43.517 --> 43:45.896
Speeding straight
through Costa Rica

43:45.931 --> 43:47.586
and giving them a
chance to catch up.

43:47.620 --> 43:49.275
But it's not cheap.

43:49.310 --> 43:50.793
[Jamiul] $107?

43:50.827 --> 43:52.551
I think we should do it.

43:52.586 --> 43:54.113
We go through both
the borders that we want.

43:54.137 --> 43:55.517
Yeah, it's $107 each.

43:55.551 --> 43:57.275
But we need to
go back in the race.

43:57.310 --> 43:58.724
Take us minimum two days...

43:58.758 --> 44:00.206
[In unison] To
get to Costa Rica.

44:00.241 --> 44:01.586
That's what I'm thinking.

44:01.620 --> 44:04.275
That's two days accommodation,
two days travel, two days food.

44:04.310 --> 44:05.931
We gotta spend to make moves.

44:05.965 --> 44:08.379
I'm not too happy
about the budget,

44:08.413 --> 44:10.758
but it is what it is.

44:10.793 --> 44:15.103
[Narrator] And emon and jamiul aren't
the only team splashing out in transport.

44:15.137 --> 44:18.620
- Whoa, aircon.
- [Jo laughs]

44:18.655 --> 44:22.379
[Sam] We're going to Costa Rica.

44:22.413 --> 44:25.344
I just will never,
ever get enough

44:25.379 --> 44:27.620
of what's outside this window.

44:27.655 --> 44:31.413
Of rainforest,
hills, clear water.

44:31.448 --> 44:35.000
Food, coconuts
to drink, pretty girls.

44:36.068 --> 44:37.689
It's happening here.

44:40.241 --> 44:42.620
[Narrator] The Marino
ballena national park

44:42.655 --> 44:45.724
in Costa Rica's pacific coast,

44:45.758 --> 44:50.724
named after the humpback whales
that migrate here each year to mate.

44:50.758 --> 44:52.389
[Shuntelle] All right,
let's get cleaning.

44:52.413 --> 44:54.000
[Narrator] In
financial dire straits,

44:54.034 --> 44:56.724
Michael and shuntelle have
found work beach-cleaning...

44:56.758 --> 44:59.551
[Shuntelle] 100% we don't
want plastic on our beaches.

44:59.586 --> 45:01.827
Got to think of our
children, our grandchildren,

45:01.862 --> 45:04.344
and our
grandchildren's children.

45:04.379 --> 45:07.655
[Narrator] ...Earning a big pay-off
that they could otherwise ill-afford.

45:07.689 --> 45:11.000
I have not seen any
whales in my lifetime.

45:12.724 --> 45:14.103
[Shuntelle] Oh!

45:14.517 --> 45:15.931
Oh, wow.

45:15.965 --> 45:17.551
That is so cool.

45:19.344 --> 45:20.907
- [Michael] Amazing.
- [Woman] It's a baby.

45:20.931 --> 45:22.413
[Woman] The mom is blowing.

45:22.448 --> 45:23.827
They're swimming together.

45:29.172 --> 45:31.275
Oh. [Laughs]

45:31.310 --> 45:34.000
I can't believe we're
so close to them as well.

45:35.827 --> 45:37.310
This is quite something.

45:43.379 --> 45:46.034
[Shuntelle] Babe, I
just need you to know

45:46.068 --> 45:47.896
that, yes, it was you
who lost the money,

45:47.931 --> 45:49.689
but we started as a team,

45:49.724 --> 45:52.000
so we as a team
have lost the money.

45:52.034 --> 45:54.827
It's really comforting
that you have got it in you

45:54.862 --> 45:57.793
to see a situation
for what it is.

45:57.827 --> 46:00.206
And I really thank
you for that. Thank you.

46:02.034 --> 46:04.827
Your gung ho attitude
throughout the whole of this trip,

46:04.862 --> 46:07.448
I was worried about,
I'm not gonna pretend.

46:07.482 --> 46:10.103
But, my goodness,
are you determined.

46:10.137 --> 46:12.482
[Michael] I think this has
opened up your mind a little bit.

46:12.517 --> 46:14.689
You can dig deep if you have to.

46:14.724 --> 46:17.206
You're quite... you're a
bit of a gung ho yourself.

46:17.241 --> 46:18.310
[Laughs]

46:21.931 --> 46:25.896
Isn't it funny how it is so
different throughout Honduras?

46:26.827 --> 46:28.586
[Narrator] Joining
them in Costa Rica,

46:28.620 --> 46:32.103
Jen and Rob, en route to
monteverde cloud forest,

46:32.137 --> 46:34.931
mountains frequently
enveloped in mist,

46:34.965 --> 46:38.275
and home to six
species of wild cats.

46:38.310 --> 46:40.310
- Stunning, isn't it?
- Gorgeous.

46:40.344 --> 46:43.413
- [Rob] We've always wanted to go to the cloud forest.
- [Jen] Yeah.

46:43.448 --> 46:45.827
[Jen] And actually, this
journey is about the experience.

46:45.862 --> 46:47.965
It's about having
the best adventure.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.172
Breathtaking.

46:51.137 --> 46:53.620
Oh, my god, where
did that come from?

46:53.655 --> 46:56.344
This is like the
best day of my life.

46:56.379 --> 46:58.034
Drinking tea in
the cloud forest.

46:58.068 --> 46:59.068
Cheers.

47:00.172 --> 47:01.620
[Rob] I can't
really describe it.

47:01.655 --> 47:03.734
[Jen] Yeah, there's no way
to describe what it looks like.

47:03.758 --> 47:04.827
It's just gorgeous.

47:06.896 --> 47:08.827
Definitely worth
the trip to get here.

47:08.862 --> 47:11.793
To actually get out all those
buses back to back to back to back.

47:13.413 --> 47:15.620
Like a timeout from the race.

47:15.655 --> 47:17.620
Stressed Jen isn't he
best from of Jen, is it?

47:17.655 --> 47:20.896
No, and the race is
making me stressed as hell.

47:22.275 --> 47:24.586
[Jen] I actually really, really,
thoroughly enjoyed today.

47:24.620 --> 47:28.068
It's been perfectly,
honestly all there,

47:28.103 --> 47:30.793
kind of up until this point.

47:30.827 --> 47:33.034
Tomorrow we're up
again at 5:00 A.M.

47:33.068 --> 47:36.793
On the road, we're try and get,
you know, straight to Panama City.

47:36.827 --> 47:39.344
But now, that actually
doesn't scare me.

47:39.379 --> 47:41.206
It actually kind of,
like, excites me.

47:46.689 --> 47:48.896
It's 5 o'clock. We're
leaving monteverde.

47:48.931 --> 47:50.931
Today, our objective is
to get to Panama City.

47:52.344 --> 47:54.034
[Narrator] Leaving
the cloud forest behind,

47:54.068 --> 47:57.551
Jen and Rob have
Panama in their sights.

47:57.586 --> 48:01.344
While Michael and shuntelle
are approaching the border.

48:01.379 --> 48:02.620
We're nearly there.

48:03.827 --> 48:06.310
We've done buses,
we've done buses,

48:06.344 --> 48:07.620
and more buses.

48:07.655 --> 48:08.931
Just get me to the checkpoint.

48:08.965 --> 48:11.034
Manifest, dom, manifest.

48:11.068 --> 48:13.724
[Narrator] First into
Panama, dom and Lizzie

48:13.758 --> 48:15.827
on a direct bus to the capital.

48:16.517 --> 48:19.068
Thank you very much.

48:19.103 --> 48:21.793
So the toilet doesn't flush,
and that's why it stinks,

48:21.827 --> 48:23.793
'cause Lizzie's
just been in there.

48:23.827 --> 48:25.689
[Laughs]

48:25.724 --> 48:27.448
Guys, it's not funny.

48:27.482 --> 48:29.275
They won't flush,
so just sat in there.

48:30.103 --> 48:31.448
I'm so sorry.

48:31.482 --> 48:33.275
I didn't know. I'm
so embarrassed.

48:33.310 --> 48:36.068
- Panama City.
- Si? Es posible?

48:36.103 --> 48:39.413
Oh, you have to go
with the bus terminal.

48:39.448 --> 48:42.620
[Narrator] Just 25 kilometers
behind, Jo and Sam.

48:43.482 --> 48:45.827
Is there seats for
the buses at 7:00?

48:45.862 --> 48:47.206
Maybe.

48:47.241 --> 48:49.010
There won't be a bus in the
middle of the night, will there?

48:49.034 --> 48:50.172
Yeah.

48:50.206 --> 48:51.586
[Narrator] To the south,

48:51.620 --> 48:54.689
after an epic 19-hour
journey through Costa Rica,

48:54.724 --> 48:58.827
emon and jamiul have paved
their way back into the race.

48:58.862 --> 49:01.758
- Hassan, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

49:01.793 --> 49:03.596
[Narrator] Before a
night bus to the capital...

49:03.620 --> 49:05.931
This is a typical
Panamanian food.

49:05.965 --> 49:09.793
[Narrator] ...Emon finds common
ground with local restaurant owner, Hassan.

49:09.827 --> 49:13.517
My father has a couple
of restaurants in UK.

49:13.551 --> 49:15.034
[Emon] Your food is really good.

49:15.517 --> 49:16.965
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.793
[Narrator] Hassan has opened
his business here five years ago,

49:19.827 --> 49:21.689
but is originally from Lebanon.

49:21.724 --> 49:24.724
When you leave family,
what did they think of you, uh...

49:25.862 --> 49:27.482
your choice to move to Panama.

49:27.517 --> 49:30.448
In the beginning they didn't
like it, especially my dad.

49:30.482 --> 49:33.620
[Jamiul] Had a similar
situation. He's okay now.

49:33.655 --> 49:35.448
He's happy with
what I'm doing. Yeah.

49:35.482 --> 49:37.517
[Laughs] Fathers,
especially in our culture...

49:37.551 --> 49:39.275
- We have the same cultures.
- Yeah.

49:39.310 --> 49:44.275
They like to have some kind of
control over their kids, you know.

49:44.310 --> 49:45.907
[Jamiul] You don't make
any mistakes. Never learn.

49:45.931 --> 49:47.896
- Exactly.
- I've made mistakes in my life.

49:47.931 --> 49:49.217
In the ten years I
was away from home.

49:49.241 --> 49:51.148
-Now, I've learnt...
-so did I. So did I. Everyone...

49:51.172 --> 49:52.424
- Who doesn't...
- Yeah. Exactly.

49:52.448 --> 49:54.413
Who doesn't make
mistakes in his life.

49:54.448 --> 49:56.172
It made me a better person.

49:57.206 --> 49:58.458
[Jamiul] Is there a
mosque around here?

49:58.482 --> 50:02.241
Yes, about 14 mosques
here in Panama.

50:02.275 --> 50:03.724
Is there one close by?

50:03.758 --> 50:07.172
[Hasan] Yeah, there's one here
in the David. I go there at 1:30 P.M.

50:07.206 --> 50:08.655
Would you mind
taking us with you?

50:08.689 --> 50:11.241
-Not at all. I'll be glad to do that.
-Ah, good.

50:11.275 --> 50:13.241
- [Indistinct]
- Um, yeah, sure. No problem.

50:13.275 --> 50:14.655
[Man chanting prayer]

50:15.551 --> 50:16.931
[Hasan chanting prayer]

50:20.206 --> 50:22.068
[Emon] It has been
very nice to see my uncle

50:22.103 --> 50:26.551
open up a bit more about why he
chose to leave the family the way he did.

50:26.586 --> 50:28.931
Maybe it takes a stranger
to make those things happen.

50:30.586 --> 50:32.734
When need to start speaking
to each other more, I think.

50:32.758 --> 50:34.241
We're gonna have to work on it.

50:34.275 --> 50:35.275
[Emon praying]

50:40.206 --> 50:42.586
[Man chanting prayer]

50:42.620 --> 50:44.413
[Emon] It's been more
than ten years plus

50:44.448 --> 50:46.379
since I've been to
the mosque with jamiul

50:46.413 --> 50:49.241
felt good. Felt a
bit closer to him.

50:51.896 --> 50:53.631
- [Emon] Thank you very much, hasan.
- [Hasan] Thank you.

50:53.655 --> 50:55.931
-Great pleasure. Thank you for everything.
-Safe trip.

50:55.965 --> 50:57.655
[Indistinct conversation]

50:57.689 --> 50:59.275
- We'll be in touch.
- Mm, sure.

50:59.310 --> 51:00.241
- Yes.
- Good bye.

51:00.275 --> 51:01.275
Inshallah.

- Gracias.
- Gracias.

51:06.448 --> 51:07.827
Bus takes us to checkpoint.

51:14.758 --> 51:18.275
It's the last bus to
checkpoint, Panama City.

51:18.310 --> 51:19.413
Wut-wut!

51:19.448 --> 51:21.137
Gracias.

51:21.172 --> 51:23.320
[Shuntelle] That was such a
result. It literally is leaving now.

51:23.344 --> 51:26.793
- Shall we do it?
- Head into that checkpoint.

51:26.827 --> 51:30.000
[Narrator] Three teams are
closing in on the second checkpoint.

foot in the capital...

51:35.103 --> 51:36.724
Welcome to Panama City.

51:36.758 --> 51:40.758

details of the checkpoint location.

51:40.793 --> 51:44.241

It's not about that.

52:19.931 --> 52:21.586
[Cell phone ringing]

52:21.620 --> 52:25.241
The building on the skyline, shaped like
a sailboat is your checkpoint location.

-So is it that one
over there -must be.

52:29.034 --> 52:31.068
Oh, on our bikes again.

52:31.103 --> 52:32.103

the race? Goodness knows.

52:50.517 --> 52:52.758
We're just going to wait
until we open that book.

52:52.793 --> 52:55.068
And race to the end.
Just how we like it.

-I'm so proud of us. I'm so happy.
-I know. I know.

53:31.482 --> 53:34.724
- It's worth all the crying and the stops...
- And the arguing.

53:34.758 --> 53:37.034
I can't believe we did it.

53:37.068 --> 53:38.348
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

53:39.137 --> 53:40.896
- I need a shower.
- [Laughing]

53:40.931 --> 53:42.965
[Narrator] While, dom
and Lizzie, freshen up,

53:43.000 --> 53:45.724
dawn breaks and two
more teams close in.

53:45.758 --> 53:46.931
[Sam] Want me to help?

53:46.965 --> 53:48.896
[Laughs] I'm all right.

53:48.931 --> 53:51.551
There. Shaped like a sailboat.

53:51.586 --> 53:52.620
Come on. We got this.

53:52.655 --> 53:54.310
That's the Plaza De francia?

53:54.344 --> 53:55.344
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53:57.103 --> 53:59.137
Big building? Skyscraper.

54:00.172 --> 54:01.172
Let's go.

54:02.862 --> 54:04.310
I've just had my wash.

54:06.758 --> 54:07.896
[Sam] What?

54:07.931 --> 54:10.482
- Welcome to Panama.
- Hola, hola.

54:10.517 --> 54:11.793
May I have your signature here?

54:11.827 --> 54:13.172
- Yeah, brilliant!
- We did it.

54:13.206 --> 54:15.172
My god, we've
done all right then.

54:15.206 --> 54:18.586
Oh, well done. And we have the
week. We want to have great fun.

54:18.620 --> 54:20.379
Really good fun.

54:20.413 --> 54:22.241
[Shuntelle] Made it.
Made it to Panama.

54:24.206 --> 54:25.206
Hurry up.

54:27.827 --> 54:29.413
[Woman speaking Spanish]

54:29.448 --> 54:30.448
You may sign the book.

54:31.034 --> 54:32.724
- Ready?
- Yeah.

54:32.758 --> 54:36.448
Third, we've caught up
20 hours on the leads.

54:36.482 --> 54:37.896
That's really impressive.

54:37.931 --> 54:39.217
- We're happy with our result.
- Yeah.

54:39.241 --> 54:40.758
We've tried really
hard on this leg.

54:40.793 --> 54:43.068
We've enjoyed so many
aspects of it as well.

54:43.103 --> 54:44.448
But obviously it is bittersweet.

54:49.689 --> 54:51.517
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

54:52.137 --> 54:55.310
Twenty one us and change.

54:55.344 --> 55:00.448
Looking at that, Argentina
seems a bit of a stretch.

55:00.482 --> 55:03.931
We did spend a lot more than we
probably would have done on this leg.

55:03.965 --> 55:06.620
This amount will make us
have to constantly question

55:06.655 --> 55:08.896
every penny,
everything we're doing

55:08.931 --> 55:12.448
and just not be able
to competitively race.

55:12.482 --> 55:16.275
We are here to compete,
but looking at money there...

55:16.310 --> 55:18.758
We'll be in stark trouble.

55:21.448 --> 55:23.000
[Narrator] Fifteen hours later.

55:23.034 --> 55:24.034
[Speaking Spanish]

55:24.862 --> 55:28.000
i t's a race to
avoid being last.

55:28.034 --> 55:29.137
[Speaking Spanish]

55:29.172 --> 55:30.424
[Jen] Didn't get
a cab, I reckon?

55:30.448 --> 55:31.965
- There it is.
- Wow.

55:33.103 --> 55:34.862
- Buenas noches.
- Buenas noches.

55:36.862 --> 55:37.862
- Ah!
- Almost there.

55:38.827 --> 55:41.586
[Both gasp]

55:41.620 --> 55:43.896
[Indistinct conversation]

55:43.931 --> 55:47.758
- Edging our way up.
- Slowly but surely.

55:47.793 --> 55:50.620
We're hoping that we can
become a force to be reckoned with.

55:50.655 --> 55:52.137
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

55:56.310 --> 55:57.379
Welcome to Panama.

55:57.413 --> 55:58.907
- Thank you.
- May I have your signature here?

55:58.931 --> 55:59.931
Of course.

56:00.965 --> 56:02.045
Oh, god. What do you think?

56:03.034 --> 56:04.034
[Giggles]

56:04.793 --> 56:06.586
- Oh!
- Oh, no.

56:06.620 --> 56:09.206
- Oh, no.
- Look, we're last.

56:09.241 --> 56:12.206
- I'm a little bit gutted about that.
- I'm absolutely gutted.

56:12.241 --> 56:13.689
[Rob] Last isn't a
good place to be.

56:14.655 --> 56:17.000
Bloody hell. Not ideal.

56:17.034 --> 56:19.793
[Narrator] All five teams
have reached Panama City

56:19.827 --> 56:22.034
with less than twenty
four hours between them.

56:23.068 --> 56:25.344
[Rob] We have
gained on the leaders.

56:25.379 --> 56:28.724
We arrived at the first
checkpoint over a day behind them.

56:28.758 --> 56:30.793
And now we're just under a day.

56:30.827 --> 56:32.724
Trying to claim some
positives here, guys.

56:32.758 --> 56:35.206
But I can't think of anything
apart from the fact we're alive.

56:35.241 --> 56:38.275
[Inhales] You're not going to
get positivity out of Jen now.

56:38.310 --> 56:40.551
[Narrator] However,
remaining budgets

56:40.586 --> 56:42.655
could have a significant
impact on the race.

56:44.448 --> 56:45.700
We've had about two hours sleep.

56:45.724 --> 56:46.965
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.413
[Jen] We got in at
3:34 A.M. to be precise.

56:49.448 --> 56:51.689
- That's a hard leg.
- Really hard leg.

56:51.724 --> 56:53.413
I think we've all
struggled this leg.

56:53.448 --> 56:54.965
Everyone's got a story to tell.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.655
[Emon] We lost our map. This
whole leg we've been doing it blind.

56:57.689 --> 56:58.965
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.206
We've had some really
bad luck on our journey, too.

57:02.241 --> 57:03.758
And we lost our money.

57:03.793 --> 57:05.517
[All gasp]

57:05.551 --> 57:07.068
- Oh...
- Oh, boy.

57:07.103 --> 57:09.655
- [Jen] You're joking.
- So, we lost over a £1,000.

57:09.689 --> 57:11.517
So that is a huge...

57:11.551 --> 57:13.172
We just can't
race with you guys.

57:13.206 --> 57:14.689
You know, we can't compete.

57:15.931 --> 57:18.551
- So that is the end of our...
- [Both] Our race is over.

57:18.586 --> 57:20.241
You're not gonna
finish the next leg?

57:20.275 --> 57:23.689
- No, this is the end of our journey.
- We're gutted.

57:23.724 --> 57:26.103
- We were not gonna need down that.
- Ah!

57:26.137 --> 57:30.068
- No.
- [Indistinct conversation]

57:30.103 --> 57:32.758
Oh, I'm keeping this one.

57:32.793 --> 57:35.413
All right, man. All right, yeah.

57:35.448 --> 57:38.655
- Just share the parts, eh?
- [Man] Yeah.

57:40.931 --> 57:42.344
[Man] I'm gutted.

57:42.379 --> 57:44.551
There's a lot more
world to see as well.

57:44.586 --> 57:46.137
[Woman] I can't lie.

57:46.172 --> 57:50.275
I really struggled, but equally there
were bits I really, really enjoyed.

57:50.310 --> 57:52.793
- Just happened too soon, didn't it?
- Yeah.

57:52.827 --> 57:55.241
[Man] I'm hoping that
even the two blasts

57:55.275 --> 57:58.034
that we've had, head
us in the right direction.

57:58.068 --> 58:01.413
[Woman] We've spoken about
whether London is going to be our home.

58:01.448 --> 58:04.000
Once my son's made
his choices and...

58:04.034 --> 58:07.310
- Then the rest.
- Yeah, where will we go?

58:07.344 --> 58:08.896
What will we do next?

58:08.931 --> 58:11.137
Now all options are open.

58:13.517 --> 58:15.758
- [Narrator] Next time...
- Hola.

58:15.793 --> 58:17.689
[Narrator] The teams
cross the Darien gap.

58:17.724 --> 58:19.068
- Yes.
- Columbia.

58:19.103 --> 58:21.103
- And enter South America.
- Oh.

58:21.137 --> 58:22.482
Coming over with a gun.

58:22.517 --> 58:25.862
- [Narrator] But civil unrest.
- State emergency in Ecuador.

58:25.896 --> 58:27.724
Oh, no.

58:27.758 --> 58:30.758
- Means, nothing will be easy.
- [Imperceptible]

58:30.793 --> 58:33.344
And the race across the world.

58:33.379 --> 58:35.103
I'm out of race, end.
