-I don't see anything at all, Sheldon.
-Ugh.

00:07.891 --> 00:11.327
You're the doctor, but I'm constantly
hearing this annoying sound.

00:12.495 --> 00:14.190
Me too.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.823
Is it a high-frequency whistle?

00:17.000 --> 00:21.494
No, it's more of a relentless,
narcissistic drone.

00:22.205 --> 00:24.469
Yeah, there's no inflammation at all,
Sheldon.

00:24.641 --> 00:26.871
Then it must be a tumor.

00:28.178 --> 00:29.805
I seriously doubt it.

00:29.979 --> 00:34.507
Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection
from all those childhood toilet swirlies.

00:36.019 --> 00:39.386
Is that possible?
I used to get those all the time.

00:39.556 --> 00:41.786
Even in church.

00:42.192 --> 00:46.856
Well, you know, if it is from a swirly,
there's something I can do, okay. Ahem.

00:47.030 --> 00:51.763
Circle, circle, dot, dot,
now you have a cootie shot.

00:53.636 --> 00:54.728
-I'm going to bed.
-Okay.

00:54.904 --> 00:57.202
-I'll be right in.
-Okay.

00:57.507 --> 00:58.997
It's not enough she mocks me...

00:59.175 --> 01:02.372
...but that isn't even the correct procedure
for a cootie shot.

01:02.779 --> 01:07.216
Do you understand that Stephanie's
not here to treat your imaginary ailments?

01:07.383 --> 01:10.511
How is it imaginary that
I keep hearing an octave above middle C?

01:10.687 --> 01:12.120
[HUMS]

01:13.056 --> 01:14.080
Is that imaginary?

01:14.257 --> 01:15.451
[HUMS]

01:15.725 --> 01:17.659
I don't think so.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.419
[HUMS]

01:21.464 --> 01:23.557
-Good night.
-Leonard, there's one more thing.

01:23.733 --> 01:26.167
Article One, Section Three
of our roommate agreement.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.770
-I'm calling an emergency meeting.
-No, you're not.

01:28.938 --> 01:32.567
Leonard moves the meeting nor occur.
Second? None heard, the motion fails.

01:33.843 --> 01:37.074
I'd like to begin the meeting
by congratulating you on the progress...

01:37.247 --> 01:39.238
...in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.

01:39.983 --> 01:41.575
-Thank you.
-And that being said...

01:41.751 --> 01:45.152
...we have to discuss the implementation
of the cohabitation rider...

01:45.321 --> 01:48.085
...which has been activated
now that you're living together.

01:48.258 --> 01:51.819
-We're not living together.
-I beg to disagree. Ahem.

01:51.995 --> 01:55.260
"A girlfriend shall be deemed, quote,
living with, unquote, Leonard...

01:55.431 --> 01:57.991
...when she has stayed over,
A, 10 consecutive nights...

01:58.168 --> 02:01.103
...or B, more than nine nights
in a three-week period, or C...

02:01.271 --> 02:04.672
...all the weekends of a given month
plus three weeknights."

02:07.577 --> 02:09.544
-That's absurd.
-No.

02:09.711 --> 02:12.943
You initialed it. See? "L.H., L.H., L.H."

02:13.116 --> 02:16.813
Okay, wait. I only initialed it
because I never thought it would happen.

02:18.121 --> 02:23.115
I initialed another clause naming you
my sidekick in case I get superpowers.

02:23.827 --> 02:25.795
Hm. Yes, you did.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.861
Now to review, the following provisions
are hereby activated.

02:30.033 --> 02:33.867
In the refrigerator, as opposed to two
separate shelves and one communal shelf...

02:34.037 --> 02:37.666
...the three of us now get individual shelves
and the door becomes communal.

02:37.841 --> 02:41.470
Next, apartment vacuuming shall be
increased from two to three times a week...

02:41.644 --> 02:44.579
...to accommodate the increased
accumulation of dead skin cells.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.113
The bathroom schedule.
I'm given to understand...

02:47.283 --> 02:51.049
...women have different needs,
so we'll have to discuss that.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.150
-I'm going to bed.
-But, yeah, but--

02:56.326 --> 02:57.623
At least take this with you.

02:57.794 --> 03:01.890
Look, and have Stephanie
initial here, here, here, here...

03:02.298 --> 03:05.165
...and here.

03:05.335 --> 03:06.996
This states that she does not now...

03:07.170 --> 03:10.333
...nor does she intend to play a percussive
or brass instrument.

-No, absolutely not.
-It's not a big deal.

03:58.688 --> 04:01.213
We have latex gloves.

04:01.391 --> 04:03.018
I don't care what the symptoms are.

04:03.192 --> 04:06.389
My girlfriend is not gonna give you
a prostate exam.

04:08.364 --> 04:11.333
-Hi, Sheldon.
-Good morning, Dr. Stephanie.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.765
I trust Leonard satisfied you
sexually last night?

04:13.937 --> 04:16.235
Oh, good God.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.338
Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.774
I heard you ask it over and over.

04:22.946 --> 04:25.608
How is it inappropriate for me
to ask it once?

04:26.082 --> 04:29.176
-He did very nicely.
-But see? She's not offended.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.115
And now you finally have an answer.

04:32.989 --> 04:35.753
-Out of coffee. Need coffee.
-Uh--

04:35.925 --> 04:39.190
-Hello.
-Hi. Stephanie, right?

04:39.362 --> 04:41.694
Mm-hm. And--? And you are?

04:41.864 --> 04:43.798
I'm Penny. I live across the hall.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.097
-Heard a lot about you.
-Really?

04:47.270 --> 04:50.398
-Mm-hm. Ha, ha.
-I haven't heard a thing about you.

04:58.181 --> 05:02.914
Leonard? Why haven't I heard a thing about
this woman who lives across the hall...

05:03.086 --> 05:07.716
...and comes into your apartment
in the morning in her underwear?

05:12.095 --> 05:13.687
Um. Uh--

05:13.863 --> 05:17.458
She's heard about you
because we're, you know, involved...

05:17.633 --> 05:21.296
...and you haven't heard about her
because....

05:22.138 --> 05:24.106
I never slept with her, I swear.

05:25.074 --> 05:28.339
In Leonard's defense,
it wasn't for lack of trying.

05:30.113 --> 05:32.581
-Thank you, Sheldon.
-You're welcome, Leonard.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.980
Look, I'm just saying, um...

05:36.152 --> 05:39.485
...Penny is one of our many neighbors,
you know.

05:39.655 --> 05:42.317
And in our building,
neighbors come and go.

05:42.492 --> 05:45.086
Well, it's very casual. No dress code or....

05:45.661 --> 05:48.721
Some mornings, I'll mosey down
to the third floor in my pajamas...

05:48.898 --> 05:51.366
...and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

05:51.534 --> 05:55.971
Really? I've never once been invited
to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.

05:56.139 --> 05:57.606
She doesn't like you.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.008
-Well, you have a gall bladder to remove.
-Yeah.

06:01.177 --> 06:04.635
And I have to get in the shower
and Penny has clothes to put on, so....

06:05.982 --> 06:09.349
-Well, it was very nice meeting you.
-Nice to finally meet you too.

06:09.519 --> 06:12.215
-I'll see you tonight? Bye.
-Yeah. Bye-bye.

06:21.564 --> 06:25.056
What could I possibly have done to offend
Mrs. Vartabedian?

06:26.135 --> 06:29.127
So that's Stephanie, huh?

06:30.840 --> 06:34.139
Why do I feel like I'm the one
that just got the prostate exam?

06:39.816 --> 06:43.149
-You know, she seems very nice.
-Oh, she is. She's terrific.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.514
And she's proving to be
a valuable roommate.

06:45.988 --> 06:50.015
-Roommate? You guys are living together?
-Like hippies.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.050
We're not living together.

06:52.228 --> 06:54.696
Do I have to pull out
the paperwork again?

06:54.864 --> 06:56.331
We're not living together.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.400
-Are you sure?
-How could I not be sure?

06:59.569 --> 07:01.867
Well, let's find out.

07:02.038 --> 07:05.599
Don't you think if a woman was living
with me, I'd be the first one to know?

07:05.775 --> 07:09.074
Oh, sweetie, you'd be the last one
to know about it.

07:12.215 --> 07:13.546
Hmm.

07:13.716 --> 07:16.241
Cute dresses.

07:16.419 --> 07:19.217
I bet this looks great on you.

07:20.156 --> 07:21.589
We're not living together.

07:21.924 --> 07:23.289
Okay. Hmm.

07:23.459 --> 07:26.019
Scented candles, fuzzy slippers. Ooh.

07:26.195 --> 07:28.527
Floral bed sheets.

07:28.965 --> 07:30.455
We're not living together.

07:30.633 --> 07:31.759
Okay, moving on.

07:31.934 --> 07:34.698
Uh, who are these guys at Disney World?

07:34.871 --> 07:35.895
Uh....

07:36.072 --> 07:38.370
The big dog is Goofy.

07:38.641 --> 07:43.374
And the older couple with the mouse ears,
I have no idea.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.473
We're not living together.

07:47.483 --> 07:49.110
You're gonna go down swinging, huh?

07:50.153 --> 07:54.590
All right. Well, we got your body lotion,
your <i>In Style</i> magazine, your jewelry box.

07:54.757 --> 07:58.784
We're not-- Where's my Bat-Signal?

07:59.428 --> 08:03.125
-You have a Bat-Signal?
-I did.

08:03.399 --> 08:05.697
It was right here.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.831
She must have--

08:08.504 --> 08:11.098
Oh, my God, we're living together.

08:12.475 --> 08:14.739
Really? What was your first clue?

08:29.425 --> 08:31.086
New pants?

08:31.260 --> 08:33.751
Yeah. Stephanie got them for me.

08:34.830 --> 08:36.126
Nice. Cotton?

08:36.299 --> 08:40.099
Actually, I think
it's more of a wool-fire ant blend.

08:41.003 --> 08:43.870
The girlfriend's buying clothes for you, huh?
Sounds serious.

08:44.039 --> 08:47.840
It is, actually.
In fact, I gave it a lot of thought...

08:48.010 --> 08:50.843
...and I decided it was time
for us to live together.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.012
Oh, Leonard, huge mistake.

08:55.184 --> 08:59.052
There's a whole buffet of women out there
and you're just standing in the corner...

08:59.222 --> 09:02.487
...eating the same deviled egg,
over and over again.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.793
At least I have an egg.
What do you have?

09:06.963 --> 09:11.263
A veritable smorgasbord
of potential sexual partners.

09:11.434 --> 09:13.629
See the blond over there?

09:14.904 --> 09:17.498
I can hit on her and you can't.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.802
So go hit on her.

09:25.014 --> 09:26.709
She's not my type.

09:27.717 --> 09:29.582
Too bad.
She was checking you out before.

09:29.752 --> 09:32.414
-She was?
-Of course not. Look at her.

09:34.523 --> 09:36.650
You know, I don't care
what you guys think.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.317
Stephanie and I are very happy
living together.

09:39.495 --> 09:42.828
I will give either of you $20 right now
to trade pants with me.

09:50.172 --> 09:53.266
-Sheldon? What are you doing here?
-Hang on.

09:54.043 --> 09:57.672
130/80. That's a little high.

09:58.080 --> 10:01.914
We can attribute that to the stress
of sneaking past the security desk.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.876
Where did you get the stethoscope
and pressure cuff?

10:05.054 --> 10:07.784
My Aunt Marion gave them to me
for my 12th birthday.

10:09.392 --> 10:13.692
She thought if I failed at theoretical physics
that I should have a trade to fall back on.

10:15.131 --> 10:18.464
And by the way, the blood pressure cuff
is called a sphygmomanometer.

10:19.135 --> 10:22.070
-Thank you.
-Didn't teach you that in medical school?

10:23.639 --> 10:25.436
-I'm kind of busy here.
-I understand.

10:25.608 --> 10:28.406
All I need is for you to authorize
these tests.

10:28.577 --> 10:32.877
Ha. A cardiac stress test,
a full-body MRI, an electromyogram...

10:33.049 --> 10:35.142
...a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?

10:35.318 --> 10:38.481
Oh, and exploratory laparoscopy.
The last time I had hiccups...

10:38.654 --> 10:41.589
...it felt like my diaphragm
was just going through the motions.

10:42.358 --> 10:44.258
Go home, Sheldon.

10:44.427 --> 10:46.224
Can I at least have the upper GI?

10:46.996 --> 10:49.396
I already drank the barium.

10:51.767 --> 10:52.859
Oh, hey.

10:53.035 --> 10:54.969
Oh, good.
Do you have any fabric softener?

10:55.137 --> 10:56.866
Yeah, sure.

11:05.715 --> 11:08.741
What are you washing, a crocodile?

11:09.618 --> 11:11.745
No. The pants that Stephanie got me.

11:11.921 --> 11:15.413
Oh, sweetie, you can't machine wash these.
They'll be ruined.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.252
-You sure?
-Absolutely.

11:20.963 --> 11:23.898
Oh, no. I wish you'd told me that sooner.

11:26.502 --> 11:29.266
-Are you guys having problems?
-No. Everything's fine.

11:29.739 --> 11:32.503
-Really?
-Yeah, it's wonderful.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.773
Okay, maybe this whole
living together happened...

11:37.947 --> 11:40.074
...kind of suddenly,
but it's fine, it's great.

11:40.249 --> 11:43.514
Okay, Leonard, if you're uncomfortable
with the way things are going...

11:43.686 --> 11:45.677
...you're allowed to say something.

11:45.855 --> 11:48.255
Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.

11:48.657 --> 11:51.626
Believe me, your feelings
are just as important as hers.

11:52.495 --> 11:55.726
No, that doesn't sound right either.

11:56.399 --> 12:00.893
Tell her you need the relationship to move
at a pace you both are comfortable with.

12:02.171 --> 12:05.140
Yeah, I could say something
like that to her.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.404
I'll go do that.

12:07.877 --> 12:09.970
-Thank you.
-Sure.

12:15.084 --> 12:17.518
You have a really good grasp on this.

12:17.686 --> 12:19.677
Maybe you could talk to her?

12:20.923 --> 12:22.413
You're kidding, right?

12:23.392 --> 12:25.326
No, but that's okay.

12:27.963 --> 12:29.828
I'll go talk to her.

12:31.834 --> 12:32.926
Wanna come with?

12:34.703 --> 12:36.694
Go.

12:38.541 --> 12:40.008
Wow.

12:48.284 --> 12:49.581
Oh, no.

12:49.752 --> 12:51.777
What?

12:51.954 --> 12:54.923
You were right.
Your larynx is terribly inflamed.

12:55.090 --> 12:58.958
-I mean, I've never seen anything like it.
-I knew it.

13:00.496 --> 13:02.760
What do I do?

13:03.265 --> 13:06.792
You're gonna need to stop talking,
immediately.

13:07.636 --> 13:09.729
-For how long should--?
-Eh, eh, eh!

13:11.006 --> 13:12.598
lmmediately.

13:14.944 --> 13:16.275
-Hey.
-Oh, hi, honey.

13:16.445 --> 13:18.106
Sheldon.

13:25.788 --> 13:26.812
What's going on?

13:27.523 --> 13:30.583
I just performed a Sheldon-ectomy.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.358
Careful. If you don't get it all,
it'll only come back worse.

13:34.530 --> 13:35.758
[LAUGHS]

13:35.931 --> 13:38.297
-Gotcha.
-Listen, we need to talk.

13:39.335 --> 13:40.359
Uh-oh.

13:40.536 --> 13:43.232
Do we need to talk,
or do we need to talk.

13:43.939 --> 13:45.907
I don't know what that means.

13:46.075 --> 13:49.533
Okay, why don't you just tell me
what it is you have to tell me?

13:49.712 --> 13:51.202
Okay. Um....

13:51.647 --> 13:53.979
Well, look, it's just that...

13:54.149 --> 13:58.017
...things between you and me
have been going pretty quick.

13:58.654 --> 14:01.646
-And?
-It's just a little scary.

14:01.991 --> 14:04.551
Well, yeah, but scary good, right?

14:04.994 --> 14:06.723
Sure.

14:08.130 --> 14:10.894
When is scary not good?

14:11.734 --> 14:16.433
-But-- Okay. Um, I have feelings, right?
-Uh-huh.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.665
Okay, and it's perfectly okay to express
those feelings, right?

14:19.842 --> 14:22.310
Of course. Why don't you tell me
what you're feeling?

14:22.478 --> 14:26.278
Okay, well, I ju-- I think it's important
to remember that we move...

14:26.448 --> 14:31.408
...at a pace that is our speed and....

14:32.288 --> 14:34.882
Oh, shoot, I had it.

14:35.391 --> 14:38.849
Okay, how about this?
How about I tell you what I'm feeling?

14:39.028 --> 14:40.928
What's that?

14:43.732 --> 14:45.256
Really? Right now?

14:46.302 --> 14:47.929
-Why not?
-I just ate.

14:48.103 --> 14:50.128
Aren't you supposed to wait an hour?

14:53.242 --> 14:54.869
I think that's for swimming.

14:55.511 --> 14:58.139
-Ah. Okay.
-Okay.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.514
-Hope I don't get cramps.
-Yeah.

15:04.019 --> 15:05.281
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:05.454 --> 15:07.718
-Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.
-Thank you.

15:07.890 --> 15:10.188
-Your pants are ruined.
-Good.

15:12.127 --> 15:14.220
So how did the talk with Stephanie go?

15:14.396 --> 15:19.561
Well, um, on one level, really, really well.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.729
So you told her you wanted
to slow things down?

15:22.905 --> 15:27.308
Not specifically.
But, um, I did tell her that I had feelings.

15:27.476 --> 15:29.637
Good. Good.

15:29.812 --> 15:31.279
And then what?

15:32.214 --> 15:36.776
And then the subject
got changed somehow.

15:37.620 --> 15:39.850
You had sex, didn't you?

15:40.456 --> 15:41.548
Um....

15:41.724 --> 15:43.248
Little bit.

15:46.128 --> 15:48.858
-What?
-Nothing.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.598
Okay, well, it sounds like
things are gonna work out.

15:55.771 --> 15:57.568
Yeah. Yeah, it's all good.

15:57.740 --> 16:00.675
Everything's gonna work out,
one way or another.

16:01.176 --> 16:02.837
God, come on, Leonard.

16:03.012 --> 16:06.448
You are entitled to try and make things
go the way you want them to.

16:07.182 --> 16:08.877
-Really?
-Yes.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.611
You don't always have to go along
with what the woman wants.

16:12.121 --> 16:13.520
Huh.

16:14.657 --> 16:19.492
-What?
-Nothing. Just rethinking my whole life.

16:23.866 --> 16:26.835
Okay, here's the thing.

16:27.002 --> 16:30.733
I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out,
she'll just dump me.

16:30.906 --> 16:33.170
Well, that's a chance you have to take.

16:33.342 --> 16:35.742
I mean, look, if it's meant to be, it'll be.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.013
Very comforting.

16:40.382 --> 16:43.476
Okay, so, what do I say to her?

16:44.119 --> 16:46.110
I don't know.
What have women said to you...

16:46.288 --> 16:48.916
...when they wanted
to slow a relationship down?

16:49.091 --> 16:52.549
I really like you,
but I wanna see how things go with Mark?

16:55.464 --> 16:57.591
Yeah, that'll slow it down.

17:00.335 --> 17:02.064
[BOTH PANTING]

17:04.740 --> 17:08.141
I'm sorry, I totally interrupted you.
What were you saying?

17:09.044 --> 17:10.477
Oh.

17:10.945 --> 17:12.641
Right, yeah. Um....

17:12.815 --> 17:17.047
So, Stephanie, here's the thing.

17:17.419 --> 17:22.550
-I really like you--
-Oh, God, here comes the speech.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.188
What speech?

17:27.896 --> 17:32.595
I really like you but maybe we should spend
a little less time together...

17:32.768 --> 17:36.204
...because I need my space,
but I'll call you on Tuesday.

17:36.371 --> 17:39.829
And then you never call me, so I call you,
but you don't call me back.

17:40.008 --> 17:42.272
And then when I run into you
at the coffee shop...

17:42.444 --> 17:44.844
...you pretend you have problems
with voice mail...

17:45.013 --> 17:48.449
...and I know that you're lying
but I pretend like I don't care...

17:48.617 --> 17:51.415
...even though I'm dying inside.

17:56.391 --> 17:57.483
No.

17:58.961 --> 18:02.453
No, no. Uh,
I wasn't gonna say any of that.

18:02.631 --> 18:04.724
I was just gonna say...

18:06.301 --> 18:09.168
-...I really like you.
-Oh!

18:09.938 --> 18:14.602
Oh, good, because I really like you too.

18:18.714 --> 18:20.614
Terrific.

18:26.455 --> 18:27.922
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:28.257 --> 18:29.849
Hey.

18:30.726 --> 18:32.751
Nice sweater.

18:33.829 --> 18:36.593
Yeah. Stephanie got it for me.
It's kind of fun.

18:36.932 --> 18:39.457
It's got a big bird on it, dude.

18:40.736 --> 18:43.296
Yeah, yeah. That's the fun part.

18:43.806 --> 18:48.004
We're also getting new curtains for my
bedroom and a dust ruffle and a duvet.

18:48.177 --> 18:52.170
And I don't even know what a duvet is,
but I'm sure if I did I wouldn't want one.

18:52.347 --> 18:56.647
But every time I talk to her about
moving out, she cries and we have sex.

18:57.419 --> 19:00.820
You're lucky.
With me, it's usually the other way around.

19:02.024 --> 19:05.050
You know, if you can't talk to her,
why don't you just text her?

19:05.394 --> 19:09.296
-Isn't that kind of cowardly?
-Oh, yeah. It's beyond contemptible.

19:09.765 --> 19:13.531
That's true. But, on the other hand,
you are wearing a bird sweater.

19:17.773 --> 19:19.434
Sold.

19:21.677 --> 19:24.976
"I think it would be better
for our relationship...

19:25.147 --> 19:28.583
...if you moved back to your place."

19:29.518 --> 19:31.042
There.

19:32.221 --> 19:34.746
-It's done.
-Good for you.

19:34.923 --> 19:37.483
Yeah, good for me.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.427
I'll never have sex again.

19:41.063 --> 19:42.826
