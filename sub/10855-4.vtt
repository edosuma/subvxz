00:00.100 --> 00:04.210
~ Some bastard's got our Annie
and he wants a million quid.
~ 50,000.

00:04.260 --> 00:08.380
We'd just have to be careful that it
didn't look like we suddenly had
a lot of money to throw around.

00:10.020 --> 00:11.930
What could they be doing in
a van that was so bad

00:11.980 --> 00:13.610
that they had to kill a police
officer?

00:13.660 --> 00:14.820
It's all your fault!

00:16.140 --> 00:18.490
You arrested
Marcus Gascoigne yesterday.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.090
He does a lot for us.

00:20.140 --> 00:21.770
Nobody is above the law.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.930
I think he's
had someone in there.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.370
Are you a virgin?

00:25.420 --> 00:26.690
I've just broken into a house.

00:26.740 --> 00:29.820
The fact that I'm a police officer
don't make it legal.

00:50.580 --> 00:52.210
Shaf, can you get onto the council

00:52.260 --> 00:54.530
and find out who owns
number 62 Milton Avenue?

00:54.580 --> 00:56.260
Sowerby Bridge? Yeah.

00:58.420 --> 01:00.450
Boss? Catherine.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.050
Have you got a minute?
Sure.

01:02.100 --> 01:05.570
OK. I saw this lad,
Tommy Lee Royce, been trying
to catch up with him

01:05.620 --> 01:08.650
for a few days, he's just
done eight years, drugs.
I was hoping to give him

01:08.700 --> 01:11.130
the welcome-home speech.
I knocked on at this house

01:11.180 --> 01:13.010
where I know he's been dossing.
No answer,

01:13.060 --> 01:14.770
but I had reason to believe,

01:14.820 --> 01:17.130
so I accessed the property
via ways and means and...

01:19.740 --> 01:22.330
..I found blood in the cellar,
a chair covered in gaffer tape,

01:22.380 --> 01:25.170
like somebody'd been tied to it,
a pair of knickers on the floor,

01:25.220 --> 01:28.250
so that and knowing what a charming
young man Tommy Lee Royce is,

01:28.300 --> 01:29.850
makes me want to get a CSI -

01:29.900 --> 01:32.090
SOCO, CSI, whatever
we're calling them this week -

01:32.140 --> 01:35.450
get one of them in there
to take a few swabs, a few photos

01:35.500 --> 01:37.930
and find out what's going on.
OK.

01:37.980 --> 01:40.970
What, so that's...
Yep.

01:41.020 --> 01:45.690
Oh, did you go to the H-MIT
briefing in Halifax this morning?

01:45.740 --> 01:47.450
I did, yes.

01:47.500 --> 01:50.210
M-CET's worked out there
were two vehicles involved.

01:50.260 --> 01:52.450
Pathologist says
she was crushed to death.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.970
Run over.

01:54.020 --> 01:55.730
More than once.

01:55.780 --> 01:59.130
There was plenty of debris
on the road, paint fragments,

01:59.180 --> 02:01.970
fragments from the number plate,
tyre marks.

02:02.020 --> 02:05.530
They'll soon identify what make,
model, year of manufacture.

02:05.580 --> 02:07.490
Endless phone calls from the public.

02:07.540 --> 02:09.580
They won't get far,
you watch this space.

02:11.020 --> 02:12.890
How is everyone?

02:12.940 --> 02:16.770
Oh, they're gutted,
they're in shock.

02:16.820 --> 02:18.300
Are you all right?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.370
I'm fine.

02:21.420 --> 02:24.210
Effed off, insecure, neurotic
and emotional, I'm fine,

02:24.260 --> 02:26.020
but other than that, yeah.

02:28.420 --> 02:29.970
You better get onto the CSI, then,

02:30.020 --> 02:32.250
see what this
Tommy Lee Jones has been up to.

02:32.300 --> 02:34.180
Yeah, it's Royce. Tommy Lee Royce.

03:06.940 --> 03:09.450
Registered freeholder
of 62 Milton Avenue.

03:09.500 --> 03:13.650
Her address is Upper Lighthazels
Farm. Thornton Clough Lane, Soyland.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.570
Her mobile number -
do you want it?

03:15.620 --> 03:19.050
Put a request in for a CSI to meet
us at Milton Avenue as soon as.

03:19.100 --> 03:22.490
Then I want you to get up there,
tape it off and wait for them, OK?

03:22.540 --> 03:24.810
I was going off on the
house-to-house with this lot.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.970
For Kirsten. Do this first.
Oh, and knock on a few doors.

03:28.020 --> 03:30.770
See if anyone's seen any comings
or goings, or heard anything.

03:30.820 --> 03:33.450
And trawl the box, see if
we've got anything on the address.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.730
Did the boss go to the H-MIT
briefing this morning?

03:35.780 --> 03:37.930
Yeah, she was run over.
More than once.

03:37.980 --> 03:39.530
Crushed to death.

03:39.580 --> 03:41.490
Hello.
Am I speaking to Julie Mulligan?

03:41.540 --> 03:43.690
~ Yes.
~ Hiya. This is Sergeant Cawood here,

03:43.740 --> 03:45.370
down at Norland Road police station.

03:45.420 --> 03:48.130
There's something I think you
can help with. I'm just wondering

03:48.180 --> 03:49.970
if I could pop in and have a chat?
Yeah.

03:50.020 --> 03:52.410
Are you all right? Why?
When? Has something happened?

03:52.460 --> 03:54.460
Any time. Soon. Now.

03:55.460 --> 03:58.260
What's it to do with?
Put your head between your knees.
Hello?

04:11.260 --> 04:12.500
Right...

04:14.100 --> 04:16.370
The thing is, Nevison...
The thing is...

04:16.420 --> 04:17.970
I may be wrong...

04:18.019 --> 04:19.940
I may be wrong, but the thing is...

04:23.180 --> 04:25.340
..I think I might know
who these people are.

04:34.580 --> 04:36.450
Did you see anything?
No. No.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.770
I-I didn't.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.340
The thing is, Nevison...

04:44.380 --> 04:46.050
Will you let me know

04:46.100 --> 04:49.210
if... When...
When they let go of her?

04:49.260 --> 04:51.930
Just so I know. Even if it's
in the middle of the night.

04:51.980 --> 04:54.810
Yeah.
I'd just like to know.

04:54.860 --> 04:56.850
I know you'll have
a lot of other things

04:56.900 --> 04:59.820
to think about when it happens...
Of course I will, Kevin.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.900
Go back to your desk.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.620
Nothing we can do.

05:11.740 --> 05:13.100
The thing is...

05:19.740 --> 05:21.140
What?

05:22.660 --> 05:25.090
I get frightened going there, and...

05:25.140 --> 05:26.450
I understand that, Kevin.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.370
And it's fine!
It's for Ann, I get that!

05:28.420 --> 05:32.060
I appreciate what you're
doing for me...

05:33.220 --> 05:34.570
Believe me.

05:34.620 --> 05:35.860
Yeah.

05:38.660 --> 05:40.380
Yeah, I know you do.

05:42.460 --> 05:44.850
Look, I have to be honest with you.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.650
It's in my name for tax reasons,

05:46.700 --> 05:49.210
and I don't actually have
a lot to do with it, so...

05:49.260 --> 05:52.410
That's all right. Who does
it have something to do with?

05:52.460 --> 05:54.210
I don't mean anything illegal.

05:54.260 --> 05:56.250
It's literally cos I pay
less tax than he does -

05:56.300 --> 05:59.330
me husband. So plan was
he'd do it up, we'd rent it out,

05:59.380 --> 06:02.330
only surprise, surprise,
he's never got his backside
into gear, so...

06:02.380 --> 06:05.330
And what's your husband's name?
Where can I find him?
What's happened?

06:05.380 --> 06:07.530
I just need to talk
to him about one of his tenants.

06:07.580 --> 06:09.570
He has no tenants.
There are no tenants.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.810
There's never been any tenants.
Not there.

06:11.860 --> 06:13.130
Not that I know of.

06:13.180 --> 06:14.650
It's been stood empty.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.580
What's his name?

06:30.820 --> 06:32.530
Hello, my little orange blossom.

06:32.580 --> 06:35.890
You better not be
up to anything, you pig.

06:35.940 --> 06:37.450
Me?

06:37.500 --> 06:39.620
You've got a copper
coming to see you.

06:42.940 --> 06:44.170
What copper?

06:44.220 --> 06:45.740
A policewoman.

06:47.180 --> 06:48.490
How do you know?

06:48.540 --> 06:50.410
She's just been in here, just now.

06:50.460 --> 06:52.100
Oh, shit!

06:56.340 --> 06:57.970
So... Well...

06:58.020 --> 07:01.690
Something about the house on Milton
Avenue. It's been broken into.

07:01.740 --> 07:05.890
Broken...? Have you been doing
something dodgy in there? No!

07:05.940 --> 07:07.610
W-What did she say?

07:07.660 --> 07:09.490
And there's no tenants, is there?

07:09.540 --> 07:10.930
No. No, no tenants.

07:10.980 --> 07:14.090
Somebody's broken in,
and she needs to talk to you.

07:14.140 --> 07:15.690
Nobody's br...
Right, well,

07:15.740 --> 07:17.690
she's coming, and you're in bother,

07:17.740 --> 07:19.570
you bastard... Why am I...

07:19.620 --> 07:24.330
If you've been up to something,
I am not, NOT, visiting you

07:24.380 --> 07:26.810
in prison. I don't even
know what you're on about.

07:26.860 --> 07:29.610
Why am I up to something
just cos some toerag's

07:29.660 --> 07:31.730
decided to
break into some property?

07:31.780 --> 07:33.010
Yeah, that's right, Ashley,

07:33.060 --> 07:35.580
you're talking to the woman
that were born last week(!)

07:37.140 --> 07:39.740
These bags are shit.

07:41.820 --> 07:43.260
Give it here.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.410
OK.

07:54.460 --> 07:57.530
I want you to go stay in
the caravan with Tommy and her.

07:57.580 --> 08:00.020
And keep it down. Why?

08:01.380 --> 08:04.050
There's a policewoman coming over.
I will deal with it.

08:04.100 --> 08:07.300
What policewoman? Just both...
How the bloody hell do I know?

08:08.500 --> 08:11.210
You both stay in there till I come
and tell you she's been and gone.

08:11.260 --> 08:13.530
All right? I don't want to
hear a peep out of anyone.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.250
No noise, no movement.

08:15.300 --> 08:18.410
If that little chicken-shit
rat-faced turd

08:18.460 --> 08:20.930
has been to the police...
He hasn't. He won't have.

08:20.980 --> 08:23.410
Do you think they'd send one woman
if they knew owt?

08:23.460 --> 08:24.770
Well, they must know summat.

08:24.820 --> 08:26.660
He hasn't been to the police,
all right?

08:28.340 --> 08:30.330
He's in this just as deep as anyone.

08:30.380 --> 08:33.530
No. He isn't. Because he hasn't
got his hands mucky.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.530
He doesn't have to sit
in that caravan.

08:35.580 --> 08:38.460
She's coming from Halifax,
she'll be here in ten minutes.

09:35.780 --> 09:37.770
There's a policewoman
coming to the farm,

09:37.820 --> 09:40.060
so we've to keep quiet
till she's gone.

09:41.140 --> 09:42.490
What policewoman?

09:42.540 --> 09:43.810
Not the one I saw?

09:43.860 --> 09:45.460
How the hell do I know?

09:48.220 --> 09:49.850
Where's your balaclava?

09:49.900 --> 09:52.690
We don't really need 'em any more,
do we?

09:52.740 --> 09:54.420
Little numpty-brain.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.780
What?

10:12.580 --> 10:13.930
What you done to her?

10:13.980 --> 10:15.580
I've gave her a bit of smack.

10:16.860 --> 10:18.100
Keep her docile.

10:20.380 --> 10:21.940
She needs gag on.

10:23.860 --> 10:25.500
She keeps being sick.

10:26.780 --> 10:28.820
Unless you want her to choke?

10:33.580 --> 10:35.100
She won't scream.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.980
She can't.

10:47.900 --> 10:49.730
Morning.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.050
Are you busy?

10:51.100 --> 10:52.650
I've got a few minutes. Go on.

10:52.700 --> 10:55.290
Right. Well, I've got some
information for you

10:55.340 --> 10:58.290
about drugs in the valley,
and you're right,

10:58.340 --> 11:01.130
it would make a fantastic article,
and it does need writing about.

11:01.180 --> 11:02.210
Good.

11:02.260 --> 11:05.250
You wouldn't believe the chain there
is before it gets onto the streets.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.610
Oh, I would.

11:06.660 --> 11:09.370
Heroin is imported pure. 100%.

11:09.420 --> 11:11.530
And then they all cut it,
everyone who handles it,

11:11.580 --> 11:12.970
all the way down the chain,

11:13.020 --> 11:15.130
to maximise their profits as they go.

11:15.180 --> 11:17.290
By the time it
gets to the streets, street heroin,

11:17.340 --> 11:19.650
it's probably no more than 2% pure.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.050
No, really(?)

11:21.100 --> 11:22.570
And they'll cut it with anything.

11:22.620 --> 11:25.330
Brick dust. Brick dust!
face powder,

11:25.380 --> 11:27.330
talcum powder, bicarbonate of soda,

11:27.380 --> 11:29.410
so when they've been
injecting for long enough,

11:29.460 --> 11:31.850
if the veins haven't collapsed,
they get blocked.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.810
Then they start having to have
their legs amputated. Yup.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.730
Oh, and up and down this chain,

11:36.780 --> 11:38.770
they're all frightened
of the person above.

11:38.820 --> 11:41.690
However high up they are, there's
always someone above pushing them

11:41.740 --> 11:43.570
to take more and more and more.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.370
So they have to push those under them
to take more and more and more.

11:46.420 --> 11:49.050
And you know, your big
regional dealers -

11:49.100 --> 11:51.130
and the people further
down the chain -

11:51.180 --> 11:54.370
they'll be people who appear
to be perfectly respectable,

11:54.420 --> 11:56.330
with perfectly respectable
businesses.

11:56.380 --> 12:00.490
It's all very slick,
it's all very well organised.

12:00.540 --> 12:02.010
I've got to go. Can I ring you
later?

12:02.060 --> 12:03.650
OK.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.050
I'm glad you're doing this. Sure.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.060
See ya. Bye.

12:32.860 --> 12:34.450
Morning. Ashley Cowgill?

12:34.500 --> 12:35.530
Yep.

12:35.580 --> 12:38.610
I've just spoken to your wife
regarding your property
on Milton Avenue.

12:38.660 --> 12:40.050
She just rung me.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.850
I need to inform you that we've had
reason to enter the property...

12:42.900 --> 12:45.210
Why?..and I need to ask you
a couple of questions, OK?

12:45.260 --> 12:48.210
Yeah, but why... Why...
Why did you have to...?

12:48.260 --> 12:49.810
Someone's broken in. When?

12:49.860 --> 12:53.020
Were you aware
the property was insecure? No.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.850
When did you last visit
the property yourself?

12:56.900 --> 12:59.970
Well... It'll be
two or three months since, now.

13:00.020 --> 13:02.850
And your wife says you've
no tenants at the minute.

13:02.900 --> 13:06.460
No, no. Never had any. I've not
got round to sorting it out.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.570
Who has keys to the property
besides yourself?

13:09.620 --> 13:11.020
Nobody...should have.

13:12.140 --> 13:13.290
Have they damaged it?

13:13.340 --> 13:16.090
Have they nicked the boiler?
Has it been flooded?

13:16.140 --> 13:17.490
Have they left shit everywhere?

13:17.540 --> 13:20.090
So...
No, not that I know of.

13:20.140 --> 13:24.010
So no-one that you know of -
no-one officially - was in there?

13:24.060 --> 13:27.330
Yeah?
Yeah. No. No, they weren't.

13:27.380 --> 13:28.580
OK.

13:29.780 --> 13:32.010
Well, I have to be frank with you,
Mr Cowgill.

13:32.060 --> 13:35.330
We've got reason to believe that
something a bit sinister's
gone on in there.

13:35.380 --> 13:39.170
In your house. In this house
that you and your wife own.

13:39.220 --> 13:42.410
Whoa. What d'you mean?
What sort of sinister?

13:42.460 --> 13:44.690
I don't know. I've got
a scene-of-crime officer

13:44.740 --> 13:47.570
in there right now taking
a few swabs and a few photographs.

13:47.620 --> 13:48.970
What it looks like to me

13:49.020 --> 13:51.330
is that someone's been held
in there against their will

13:51.380 --> 13:53.380
and treated rather unpleasantly.

13:54.940 --> 13:57.060
Bloody hell. Yeah.

13:58.220 --> 14:00.610
So, we've had a couple
of releases from prison in the area

14:00.660 --> 14:02.010
over the last few weeks,

14:02.060 --> 14:04.810
and I was wondering if any of these
names were familiar to you.

14:04.860 --> 14:06.330
Zak Midgeley?

14:06.380 --> 14:08.810
Jamie Monkford. No.

14:08.860 --> 14:10.380
Usman Farah.

14:11.420 --> 14:12.820
Tommy Lee Royce.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.530
Should they be familiar to me?

14:15.580 --> 14:18.460
Are they? Any of them? No.

14:19.540 --> 14:21.010
These lads are all in their 20s.

14:21.060 --> 14:24.410
Do you employ anyone or
had contact with anyone that age

14:24.460 --> 14:26.810
who might associate
with lads like that?

14:26.860 --> 14:29.020
Newly released from prison?
No. No, no.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.210
We'll be finished
at the property in an hour or so.

14:35.260 --> 14:37.530
You might want to go in there
when we're done and...

14:37.580 --> 14:39.130
make sure it's secure.

14:39.180 --> 14:41.220
If anything occurs to you...

14:42.540 --> 14:44.370
..that might be relevant,

14:44.420 --> 14:47.340
will you give me a ring? Sure.

14:48.980 --> 14:50.610
Thanks for your time.

14:50.660 --> 14:52.540
Well, thanks for telling me.

14:56.540 --> 14:58.410
What are you building?

14:58.460 --> 15:00.620
Oh, just renovating this barn.

15:02.260 --> 15:03.730
It's been going on months.

15:03.780 --> 15:08.010
Cos part of it's listed,
they make you jump through hoops.

15:08.060 --> 15:09.500
I'll be in touch.

15:16.780 --> 15:19.170
~ How we doing?
~ CSI's here.

15:19.220 --> 15:20.690
Just going in just now.

15:20.740 --> 15:24.330
I've told them what you want doing,
and I've filmed all the upstairs
with the head-cam.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.900
Kitchen, sitting room?
Yeah, and the upstairs upstairs.

15:28.020 --> 15:30.610
So I'm just gonna
knock on a few doors now.

15:30.660 --> 15:33.810
Great. I'll be there in ten minutes.
Just got another house call to make.

15:33.860 --> 15:36.490
I'm popping in on Tommy Lee Royce's
mother, OK? Who?

15:36.540 --> 15:39.460
Newly released.
Then I'll be with you.

16:08.140 --> 16:10.170
Hello, Lynn. I'm Catherine Cawood.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.740
Got a few minutes?

16:18.620 --> 16:19.970
I'll be honest with you,

16:20.020 --> 16:22.220
if it's about our Tommy,
I haven't seen him.

16:23.580 --> 16:25.850
This is his registered
release address.

16:25.900 --> 16:28.410
Well, I've seen him, if you know
what I mean, but...

16:28.460 --> 16:29.540
Sit down.

16:30.780 --> 16:33.580
He doesn't live here.
I don't know where he lives.

16:36.740 --> 16:38.410
When did you last see him?

16:38.460 --> 16:40.690
About three weeks ago,
when he came out.

16:40.740 --> 16:43.650
He stopped here one night
and then he were off. Gone.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.300
I don't know where.

16:46.420 --> 16:49.050
Have you got a mobile
number for him? Nope.

16:49.100 --> 16:50.610
No, he don't have one.

16:50.660 --> 16:53.250
Well, he probably has one,
do you know what I mean?

16:53.300 --> 16:55.010
But if he has, I
don't know owt about it.

16:55.060 --> 16:58.250
Who does he hang about with?
Nobody. I don't know. People.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.130
I don't know. Has he done summat?

17:00.180 --> 17:01.730
If you see him...

17:01.780 --> 17:03.170
Stupid question.

17:03.220 --> 17:05.569
If you see him...
He's only been out three week.

17:05.619 --> 17:09.210
If you see him, can you tell him
that I need to see him?

17:09.260 --> 17:11.780
Sergeant Cawood. Catherine Cawood.

17:14.420 --> 17:17.300
And to pop down to Norland Road
nick at his earliest convenience.

17:18.540 --> 17:22.210
It's unlikely that I will see him,
but if I do, I will, yeah.

17:22.260 --> 17:26.849
OK. Right.
You'll remember? I'll try.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.770
And tell him it'd be much better
for him if he pops in to see me

17:29.820 --> 17:31.530
without me having to
go looking for him

17:31.580 --> 17:34.210
the next time he has a meeting
with his probation officer. OK?

17:34.260 --> 17:36.770
He'll be here when he wants summat,
do you know what I mean?

17:36.820 --> 17:39.410
You never know when that's going
to be, do you know what I mean?

17:39.460 --> 17:41.570
So you'll pass on that
message for me, Lynn?

17:41.620 --> 17:43.020
Yep.

17:44.380 --> 17:46.330
All right.

17:46.380 --> 17:48.970
You look after yourself.
And you too.

17:49.020 --> 17:50.940
I'll see myself out.
Are you...?

17:52.460 --> 17:54.570
What? Am I what?
Catherine Cawood...

17:54.620 --> 17:56.130
Is it you that's...

17:56.180 --> 17:59.500
Your grandson,
is it him that's our Tommy's lad?

18:01.820 --> 18:03.570
Who's told you that?

18:03.620 --> 18:06.050
Is he called Ryan?
Who's told you that?

18:06.100 --> 18:08.570
Somebody mentioned it
down in Hebden the other day.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.250
Who? Friend of a friend.

18:10.300 --> 18:11.810
Who? I don't know. Somebody.

18:11.860 --> 18:14.450
I don't know, I can't remember.
Well, who were you with?

18:14.500 --> 18:16.210
Well, you wouldn't know 'em.
Try me.

18:16.260 --> 18:18.170
Well, you would.
The usual smackheads.

18:18.220 --> 18:20.850
Sorry. They don't like being
called smackheads, but they are.

18:20.900 --> 18:24.130
Your Tommy has got nothing.
to do with my grandson. All right?

18:24.180 --> 18:25.370
I were only saying.

18:25.420 --> 18:27.530
You need to get that idea right
out of your head.

18:27.580 --> 18:28.810
Right.

18:28.860 --> 18:30.500
Right.

18:50.820 --> 18:53.850
Shit.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.660
Shit. Shit.

18:59.580 --> 19:00.980
Shit.

19:43.900 --> 19:45.250
Why don't we draw straws?

19:45.300 --> 19:48.290
Because I'm not doing it,
that's why not.

19:48.340 --> 19:49.540
Why not?

19:50.900 --> 19:52.300
It's your turn.

19:55.220 --> 19:57.450
You must know somebody. Higher up.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.570
Someone who can
make people disappear.

19:59.620 --> 20:01.130
Do you think?

20:01.180 --> 20:03.090
Gary Gaggoski. He disappeared.

20:03.140 --> 20:06.650
Tony Stead says he's sat at
the bottom of Scammonden dam in
concrete underpants.

20:06.700 --> 20:11.010
Nobody higher up is going to know a
single damned thing about
this stupid business,

20:11.060 --> 20:13.060
because the second they do,
it's me they'll...

20:17.420 --> 20:20.050
We were moonlighting,
we were out of our depth,

20:20.100 --> 20:21.610
it shouldn't have happened.

20:21.660 --> 20:24.330
D'you think I want people higher up
thinking we're a liability?

20:24.380 --> 20:26.020
It were your idea. All right!

20:29.820 --> 20:33.730
It wasn't my idea to murder
a policewoman, was it?

20:33.780 --> 20:35.770
You should get him round here.

20:35.820 --> 20:38.930
Kevin shitty-arse twat-face!
Make him do it,

20:38.980 --> 20:40.930
make him get his hands
all covered in blood.

20:40.980 --> 20:43.700
Yeah, well, I'm tempted.
Rub his stupid nose in it.

20:45.700 --> 20:47.420
Have you ever killed anybody?

20:50.780 --> 20:52.290
Me?

20:52.340 --> 20:54.500
Sod off. Have I hell.

20:58.260 --> 21:00.620
If you both give
me five grand each...

21:01.740 --> 21:04.700
..from that last stash
Kevin brought over...

21:05.700 --> 21:07.140
..I'll do it.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.450
How?

21:10.500 --> 21:12.220
It don't matter how.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.170
Deal or no deal?

21:16.220 --> 21:19.250
You're not going to do to her what
you did to that policewoman.

21:19.300 --> 21:20.700
Aren't I?

21:27.180 --> 21:28.420
Yeah.

21:29.740 --> 21:31.210
OK.

21:31.260 --> 21:32.500
Deal.

21:34.740 --> 21:36.260
I'll need a van.

21:37.460 --> 21:40.060
Not a white one.
I don't want pulling over.

21:41.220 --> 21:42.500
OK.

21:44.700 --> 21:49.050
And then, when it's done,
you two, you need to disappear.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.450
All right?

21:50.500 --> 21:52.090
Are you sacking us?

21:52.140 --> 21:53.940
I'm advising you to move on.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.610
You've got your stash from Kevin,

21:56.660 --> 21:58.090
so move on.

21:58.140 --> 21:59.500
You're sacking us.

22:23.260 --> 22:24.690
What do you know?

22:24.740 --> 22:27.250
Fella said he saw a white transit
van parked down here,

22:27.300 --> 22:29.130
outside the property, like,
four days ago.

22:29.180 --> 22:31.290
That's about it.

22:31.340 --> 22:32.690
A white transit van?

22:32.740 --> 22:34.250
Yeah.

22:34.300 --> 22:37.410
Then again, how many white transit
vans are there in Halifax?

22:37.460 --> 22:39.780
It'd be a bit of a coincidence,
wouldn't it?

22:41.260 --> 22:44.490
I'll flag it up to H-MIT,
they might want to check any CCTV.

22:44.540 --> 22:46.810
Do you want me
to knock on a few more doors?

22:46.860 --> 22:47.970
No.

22:48.020 --> 22:50.490
I'll just pop down to the cellar
and have a word with the CSI,

22:50.540 --> 22:51.820
then we'll leave it at that.

23:00.020 --> 23:01.090
Hiya.

23:01.140 --> 23:04.170
You said to let you know
if Helen turned up.

23:04.220 --> 23:06.690
Well, she's just got here.

23:06.740 --> 23:08.890
Just now.

23:08.940 --> 23:10.890
I've got another
three hours on duty.

23:10.940 --> 23:12.090
Right, OK.

23:12.140 --> 23:14.410
Will she still be there
at half four-ish?

23:14.460 --> 23:15.890
Well, I'd have thought so.

23:15.940 --> 23:18.770
She sometimes gets tired, but yeah.

23:18.820 --> 23:20.540
Right, I'll see you later.

23:31.860 --> 23:33.010
Oh!

23:34.780 --> 23:37.330
You should have dropped
him round at Janina's,

23:37.380 --> 23:39.010
he could've played with Cesco.

23:39.060 --> 23:40.610
Where is she?

23:40.660 --> 23:42.490
She's just there with Smiffy.

23:42.540 --> 23:45.850
He's got an appointment with
social services at ten to five,

23:45.900 --> 23:49.020
so if you want to grab her,
I'll bring you over a cup of tea.

23:52.780 --> 23:54.330
Helen?

23:54.380 --> 23:55.610
Hello. I'm Catherine,

23:55.660 --> 23:58.530
I'm Clare's sister. We spoke
on the phone last night.

23:58.580 --> 24:01.490
Oh, yes. Yes, she said you
were coming to pick her up.

24:01.540 --> 24:03.770
I'm sorry I didn't...

24:03.820 --> 24:06.690
No, no. I hope you don't mind,
only I was worried about you.

24:06.740 --> 24:07.850
And...

24:07.900 --> 24:12.690
Sorry, I know this is awkward,
and I know you've not been well,

24:12.740 --> 24:15.530
but is your husband hurting you?

24:15.580 --> 24:17.610
My husband?

24:17.660 --> 24:19.610
Look, I don't want
to overstep the mark

24:19.660 --> 24:21.850
and I'm sorry if I've got
the wrong end of the stick,

24:21.900 --> 24:24.410
but last night, when you said,
"I'm with my husband,"

24:24.460 --> 24:26.970
it occurred to me that
maybe you couldn't speak,

24:27.020 --> 24:29.250
and maybe that was your
way of telling me,

24:29.300 --> 24:31.650
and I wouldn't be doing my job
properly if I didn't ask...

24:31.700 --> 24:34.290
No. My husband isn't hurting me.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.700
Are you sure?

24:37.220 --> 24:40.930
I know people think he's a bit
of a rough diamond, and he is...

24:40.980 --> 24:43.210
but not like that.

24:43.260 --> 24:45.650
He'd never do something like that.

24:45.700 --> 24:47.210
It takes all sorts.

24:47.260 --> 24:50.220
You really have got
the wrong end of the stick.

24:51.340 --> 24:54.210
It's not always easy to acknowledge
things sometimes. It's not...

24:54.260 --> 24:56.770
It's very kind of you
to be concerned,

24:56.820 --> 24:59.580
but you really have got
the wrong end of the stick.

25:06.620 --> 25:08.100
OK.

25:14.460 --> 25:16.300
My daughter's been kidnapped.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.580
What? Tea.

25:28.220 --> 25:29.780
Can we just sit down?

25:33.740 --> 25:35.540
I wanted to tell the police...

25:36.740 --> 25:38.330
..but Nevison won't.

25:38.380 --> 25:40.810
He wants to do exactly
what they tell him,

25:40.860 --> 25:46.210
and they have said
they'd let go of her...

25:46.260 --> 25:49.770
after the last lot of money he
gave them, just this morning,

25:49.820 --> 25:52.410
but we've not
heard anything, not yet.

25:52.460 --> 25:55.540
What's happened?
Ann's been taken.

25:56.700 --> 25:58.370
She's been abducted.

25:58.420 --> 26:00.930
How long's she been missing?
Four nights.

26:00.980 --> 26:04.050
When did you last see her?
Tuesday morning.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.850
She was driving into Huddersfield.

26:06.900 --> 26:10.210
She set off... She has a little Mini,
it's very distinctive.

26:10.260 --> 26:11.890
She had a dental appointment,

26:11.940 --> 26:13.570
only I know she didn't turn up

26:13.620 --> 26:16.890
because I rang up
to see if she'd been.

26:16.940 --> 26:18.940
He's been giving them money?

26:20.420 --> 26:21.850
Yes. How?

26:21.900 --> 26:23.330
How much?

26:23.380 --> 26:25.620
No, how.
I don't know.

26:27.460 --> 26:29.580
Do you think I should
tell the police?

26:30.660 --> 26:32.730
You have told the police, Helen.

26:32.780 --> 26:35.890
I'm sorry, but I'm obliged to report
something like this, I can't just...

26:35.940 --> 26:37.250
No. No. No.

26:37.300 --> 26:40.410
He spoke to a friend who
was in the CID, and he said...

26:40.460 --> 26:41.530
Retired?

26:41.580 --> 26:44.290
Yeah. Well,
he should've known better.

26:44.340 --> 26:49.370
No, look, Nevison really doesn't
want the police involved.

26:49.420 --> 26:52.850
I think he's terrified
they'd wade in and...

26:52.900 --> 26:55.770
Look, I don't know how
to say this except bluntly,

26:55.820 --> 26:59.810
but most times when something like
this happens, the outcome isn't...

26:59.860 --> 27:01.130
It's not good.

27:01.180 --> 27:04.410
You have a much, much, and I cannot
tell you how much, better chance

27:04.460 --> 27:07.250
of getting her back safe, all in one
piece, with the police on board.

27:07.300 --> 27:09.810
Nobody'll wade in,
we have techniques,

27:09.860 --> 27:12.340
we have highly trained
people, Helen.

27:13.620 --> 27:16.290
Are you going to let me
make that phone call?

27:16.340 --> 27:17.890
Oh, good Lord...

27:17.940 --> 27:20.570
Do you not think this is
the right way forward, Helen?

27:20.620 --> 27:22.900
Yes. I don't know.

27:24.980 --> 27:27.650
I don't want him
to think I've gone behind his back.

27:27.700 --> 27:29.100
I'll talk to him.

27:30.900 --> 27:34.450
If something did happen and you
hadn't acted on your instincts,

27:34.500 --> 27:36.940
you'd never forgive yourself,
would you?

27:41.500 --> 27:42.850
Yeah. Hello.

27:42.900 --> 27:45.730
It's Sergeant Cawood here,
from Norland Road police station,

27:45.780 --> 27:47.570
Sowerby Bridge, Calderdale District.

27:47.620 --> 27:50.370
Can I speak to the on-call
Detective Superintendant, please?

27:50.420 --> 27:53.330
He's in a meeting, is he?
Can you knock on his door for me?

27:53.380 --> 27:56.170
I need to talk to him about a
kidnap. It's a tiger kidnap,

27:56.220 --> 27:58.700
it's live, it's ongoing,
it's happening now.

28:09.860 --> 28:11.340
Are you warm enough?

28:26.220 --> 28:27.780
Catherine?

28:29.900 --> 28:31.850
Phil.

28:31.900 --> 28:33.540
How are you?

28:36.100 --> 28:37.810
This is Helen.

28:37.860 --> 28:39.570
Helen, hello.

28:39.620 --> 28:41.450
I'm Phil Crabtree.

28:41.500 --> 28:44.290
I'm a detective inspector with
the National Crime Agency.

28:44.340 --> 28:47.290
I just need you to stay calm
and tell me everything you know.

28:47.340 --> 28:51.490
I know very little.
I've been saying to Catherine,

28:51.540 --> 28:54.370
I'm not really the person
you need to be talking to.

28:54.420 --> 28:56.970
The person you need to be talking
to is going to be very cross

28:57.020 --> 28:58.860
when he finds out
I've spoken to you.

29:10.580 --> 29:12.850
Mr Gallagher?

29:12.900 --> 29:15.770
Look, I know you didn't want us
involved, but I'm going to tell you

29:15.820 --> 29:19.010
the same thing Sergeant Cawood's
told your wife, OK?
We're four days in.

29:19.060 --> 29:22.850
Your daughter is likely to know a lot
about the people that have taken her.

29:22.900 --> 29:27.050
They've got your money,
and the reality is,

29:27.100 --> 29:30.260
they've got things to lose
by releasing her alive...

29:31.580 --> 29:33.700
..whatever they're telling you.

29:34.780 --> 29:36.730
Have you heard any more
since this morning?

29:36.780 --> 29:38.410
No.

29:38.460 --> 29:41.130
OK. Well, then,
we need to work quickly.

29:41.180 --> 29:44.010
All I need now is information from
you and we'll get the ball rolling.

29:44.060 --> 29:46.420
I know very little.
You'll be surprised.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.050
Does he always ring you
on your mobile? Yeah.

29:51.100 --> 29:53.330
What comes up on the
screen when he rings?

29:53.380 --> 29:54.530
Annie's number first time,

29:54.580 --> 29:57.210
then since then it's says
"number unknown". It's all on there.

29:57.260 --> 30:00.330
Same man every time? Yep.
When does he ring? Any time.

30:00.380 --> 30:02.130
There's no pattern? No.

30:02.180 --> 30:03.650
No.

30:03.700 --> 30:06.130
And Helen said the last phone call
was this morning?

30:06.180 --> 30:08.250
This morning, yeah. Ten past eight.

30:08.300 --> 30:11.010
Saying where he wanted the money
dropped. They tell me how much,

30:11.060 --> 30:13.730
then they'll ring back a few
hours later, say where they want it.

30:13.780 --> 30:17.210
They rang yesterday afternoon,
then again this morning. They? He.

30:17.260 --> 30:19.330
Does he have an accent?
Round here.

30:19.380 --> 30:22.330
How old does he sound?
Oh, I don't know. Not old.

30:22.380 --> 30:25.010
What kind of language does he use?
He's cocky. He's clever.

30:25.060 --> 30:26.570
He thinks he's funny.

30:26.620 --> 30:30.690
"You can call me God", he says.
He reckons like he's helping me.

30:30.740 --> 30:34.370
"I'll do what I can, Nev,
but these people, they're nasty",

30:34.420 --> 30:37.330
like he's got nowt to do with 'em.
He calls you Nev.

30:37.380 --> 30:38.810
Everyone calls me Nev.

30:38.860 --> 30:41.170
Do you think it's someone you know?
Someone you've met?

30:41.220 --> 30:43.890
It could be, but it's not struck me.
I don't recognise the voice.

30:43.940 --> 30:46.380
Somebody who knows ME, obviously.

30:47.460 --> 30:50.010
How many times have you
delivered the money? Twice.

30:50.060 --> 30:52.490
How do you do it? They asked
for my accountant to take it.

30:52.540 --> 30:54.410
He's called Kevin Weatherill.

30:54.460 --> 30:55.900
Why do you think they ask for him?

30:57.180 --> 30:58.970
Um...he's little.

30:59.020 --> 31:02.010
They'll be thinking
he's easily intimidated.

31:02.060 --> 31:03.970
So they know Kevin?

31:04.020 --> 31:05.450
I mean, they know of him.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.610
They ask for him by name? No.

31:07.660 --> 31:09.940
No, I think he said,
"That little..."

31:11.460 --> 31:16.730
No, he said, "That irritating little
twat of an accountant you've got."

31:16.780 --> 31:20.250
And so, where does Kevin go
when he takes the money?

31:20.300 --> 31:23.930
McDonald's. Just off the
Huddersfield ring road, first time,

31:23.980 --> 31:26.890
then Birch Services
this morning, on the M62.

31:26.940 --> 31:29.330
So Kevin went this morning
to Birch Services with...

31:29.380 --> 31:32.300
how much money? £50,000. Cash.

31:49.780 --> 31:51.260
Oh, shit.

31:52.860 --> 31:54.740
What are you doing here?

31:56.500 --> 31:58.970
I've come to see you.

31:59.020 --> 32:00.740
Oh, yeah, that's likely(!)

32:05.500 --> 32:07.460
Do you want to earn a few quid?

32:09.300 --> 32:10.970
Doing what?

32:11.020 --> 32:13.580
Nothing. All right.

32:14.780 --> 32:16.810
I just need to borrow your cellar.

32:16.860 --> 32:18.410
Just for a few days.

32:18.460 --> 32:21.330
How much? 100.

32:21.380 --> 32:22.890
Two.

32:22.940 --> 32:24.330
Two quid?

32:24.380 --> 32:25.770
OK. You're cheap.

32:25.820 --> 32:27.330
Still, we knew that.

32:27.380 --> 32:28.900
200.

32:30.180 --> 32:32.450
Whatever.
I should've said three.

32:32.500 --> 32:35.170
Yeah, but you didn't.

32:35.220 --> 32:38.140
Nothing illegal. Oh, shut up.

32:40.340 --> 32:41.770
Where have you been stopping?

32:41.820 --> 32:44.090
Up your arse. Oh, you're so funny.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.380
This is a pile of shite.

32:50.980 --> 32:52.690
I'll be putting a padlock on here.

32:52.740 --> 32:54.770
Will you?

32:54.820 --> 32:56.100
It's a dog.

32:57.220 --> 32:59.290
It's been trained up for a fight.

32:59.340 --> 33:02.290
I said I'd look after
it just for a few days.

33:02.340 --> 33:04.610
So when it's here,
I'll keep it muzzled,

33:04.660 --> 33:07.410
but it might make a bit of noise,
but don't go down there, all right?

33:07.460 --> 33:09.450
It'll have your leg off.
What, with a muzzle on?

33:09.500 --> 33:11.850
I can't keep it muzzled
all the time, can I?

33:11.900 --> 33:13.970
It'd be inhuman.

33:14.020 --> 33:15.980
I'll want the cash upfront.

33:31.620 --> 33:34.370
Make sure you stick it
all up your nose, Mother.

33:34.420 --> 33:35.610
Piss off.

33:35.660 --> 33:37.060
And you.

33:43.580 --> 33:46.330
Oh, aye, there were
this woman here this morning.

33:46.380 --> 33:48.050
What woman? Catherine Cawood.

33:48.100 --> 33:51.090
She's a police sergeant
down at Sowerby Bridge.

33:51.140 --> 33:53.090
She said she wants to talk to you.

33:53.140 --> 33:57.180
She said next time you're passing
you're to pop in the nick, she says.

34:00.340 --> 34:01.610
Why?

34:01.660 --> 34:03.380
She's Becky Cawood's mother.

34:04.620 --> 34:07.330
Did you know she had a kid
before she died?

34:07.380 --> 34:08.810
Who did?

34:08.860 --> 34:11.500
Who died? Becky Cawood.

34:13.659 --> 34:14.889
How?

34:14.940 --> 34:16.610
I don't know.

34:16.659 --> 34:18.770
Anyway, kid's called Ryan.

34:18.820 --> 34:22.290
Lives with her, the policewoman.
She's his granny.

34:22.340 --> 34:23.900
Is it yours?

34:24.940 --> 34:27.820
One of the smackheads down
Hebden were saying it's yours.

34:29.139 --> 34:32.260
Anyway, she wants to see you.

34:36.460 --> 34:39.010
In the next hour or so,
we'll send someone into your home

34:39.060 --> 34:40.929
and someone into your workplace.

34:40.980 --> 34:43.489
They'll be undercover,
disguised as a telecoms worker,

34:43.540 --> 34:46.650
or something like that.
We'll duplicate the phone.

34:46.699 --> 34:48.420
I've got the number.

34:49.460 --> 34:51.650
If they try and call you
in the next half an hour or so,

34:51.699 --> 34:54.929
before we're up and running,
whatever you do, stall them.

34:54.980 --> 34:56.570
If they ask you for more money,

34:56.620 --> 35:00.010
say you're happy to do that, you just
need time to get it together. OK?

35:00.060 --> 35:02.450
And do I? Get money together?

35:02.500 --> 35:05.850
Yeah.
If you can. Everything as normal.

35:05.900 --> 35:08.340
Don't give them any reason
to think anything's happened.

35:09.540 --> 35:13.970
And don't tell anyone - ANYONE -
what's going on.

35:14.020 --> 35:17.130
That does include Kevin.
I know you trust him...

35:17.180 --> 35:18.690
I don't trust anyone, pal.

35:18.740 --> 35:21.330
But from our point of view,
till we can eliminate him,

35:21.380 --> 35:23.300
we'll be treating him
as a suspect. OK?

35:24.500 --> 35:25.780
One last one.

35:28.140 --> 35:30.500
Have you asked for any proof
that she hasn't been hurt?

35:35.820 --> 35:38.330
He sent, um...

35:38.380 --> 35:40.620
Yesterday, he sent this.

35:50.460 --> 35:52.060
I'm sorry. Can I...?

36:01.340 --> 36:02.700
OK.

36:03.900 --> 36:07.740
Just go home, carry on as normal,
and we'll be in touch. All right?

36:10.300 --> 36:11.820
Have you got a minute?

36:21.660 --> 36:23.530
I didn't plan this.

36:23.580 --> 36:25.530
She turned up at the mission.

36:25.580 --> 36:27.850
Only because she was
worried about me and even then...

36:27.900 --> 36:30.690
I keep thinking about Kevin.
Why Kevin?

36:30.740 --> 36:34.530
Why did they ask
for Kevin to deliver the money?

36:34.580 --> 36:36.770
How well do you know them?

36:36.820 --> 36:39.250
I don't.
She's a friend of my sister's. Why?

36:39.300 --> 36:41.610
She may have been alive
when that picture was taken,

36:41.660 --> 36:44.330
but if they're saying they're
not asking for any more money,

36:44.380 --> 36:46.020
and that was this morning...

36:48.300 --> 36:51.650
Kevin Weatherill came
into my nick four days ago.

36:51.700 --> 36:54.850
He was agitated. He wanted
to tell me something and then

36:54.900 --> 36:56.370
before he could, he disappeared.

36:56.420 --> 36:58.500
We'll have obs on him
within an hour.

37:00.140 --> 37:02.420
How long have you been
back in uniform?

37:04.300 --> 37:05.940
Nearly nine years.

37:07.140 --> 37:08.740
I had a bit of a...

37:12.540 --> 37:14.450
My daughter died.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.730
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

37:16.780 --> 37:18.490
Then I had a grandson to look after,

37:18.540 --> 37:22.100
and being a detective didn't fit
the lifestyle any more, so...

37:28.620 --> 37:30.340
It was nice to see you.

37:35.260 --> 37:37.490
Thank you, Catherine.
No problem.

37:37.540 --> 37:40.570
Do you need a lift? No, you're fine,
I'll ring our Clare.

37:40.620 --> 37:42.380
Ready to go.

37:49.820 --> 37:51.780
Ooh!

38:01.460 --> 38:02.620
Hello.

38:04.340 --> 38:05.810
Hello. Fancy seeing you here.

38:05.860 --> 38:08.290
She's not in. Is she not?

38:08.340 --> 38:10.530
Well, that's all right.

38:10.580 --> 38:13.260
I was coming to see Ryan.

38:14.420 --> 38:16.690
I heard you wanted
to play football with me.

38:16.740 --> 38:18.770
In the dark? Do you want to?

38:18.820 --> 38:22.210
I would. Only the thing is,
I've never been very good at it.

38:22.260 --> 38:24.250
It's easy.
I've got two left feet.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.650
Have you?
Who do you support?

38:26.700 --> 38:29.370
Man City. That's bad.

38:29.420 --> 38:31.410
Edin Dzeko.

38:31.460 --> 38:33.490
It's all going right
over my head, kid.

38:33.540 --> 38:34.730
Striker.

38:34.780 --> 38:37.610
Really? What else do you like doing?

38:37.660 --> 38:40.370
Me bike.
He likes next-door's cat.

38:40.420 --> 38:41.650
Do you?

38:41.700 --> 38:43.850
I feed it when they go on holiday.
Very good.

38:43.900 --> 38:45.410
He likes me best.

38:45.460 --> 38:48.020
So you say.

38:51.060 --> 38:52.490
So...
Hello?

38:52.540 --> 38:54.450
Edin...Dzeko?
Is everything all right?

38:54.500 --> 38:55.890
Where's he from? Not Manchester.

38:55.940 --> 38:59.050
Bosnia. Do you know where Bosnia is?
On a map?

38:59.100 --> 39:00.690
Yeah. Do you?

39:00.740 --> 39:02.250
Hang on.

39:02.300 --> 39:05.450
I've to go pick our Catherine up
in Sowerby Bridge.

39:05.500 --> 39:08.090
She's stuck there without a car.
Are you...

39:08.140 --> 39:11.410
all right with him if I nip out?

39:11.460 --> 39:13.420
Well, I could...

39:16.340 --> 39:19.330
Yeah. Yeah, you go.

39:19.380 --> 39:21.660
He's all right here with me.

39:29.140 --> 39:31.330
One colleague described
PC McAskill

39:31.380 --> 39:32.770
as fun-loving and out-going,

39:32.820 --> 39:35.730
and another as someone for whom
nothing was too much trouble,

39:35.780 --> 39:38.210
especially when it came
to helping others.

39:38.260 --> 39:40.650
A family member talked about how,
since the age of seven,

39:40.700 --> 39:43.130
she'd talked about wanting
to be a police officer,

39:43.180 --> 39:47.530
and after securing a place at
university in 2009 to study history,

39:47.580 --> 39:52.050
instead enrolled as a PCSO.
The funeral is expected...

39:52.100 --> 39:55.090
..to take place in two weeks' time.

39:55.140 --> 39:56.930
Can we turn this off?

39:56.980 --> 39:59.020
What's the matter?

40:01.740 --> 40:04.490
What's happened?
I've thought...

40:04.540 --> 40:07.290
I've thought of a way out
of the mess.

40:07.340 --> 40:09.090
How?

40:09.140 --> 40:12.330
I nearly, this morning,
said something to Nevison, but...

40:12.380 --> 40:14.370
Said something? Yeah. Look.

40:14.420 --> 40:16.570
If I said, "I think I know
who these people are,"

40:16.620 --> 40:18.410
and I persuade him to
go to the police...

40:18.460 --> 40:19.770
And to say Ashley?

40:19.820 --> 40:21.210
To say Ashley's name? Yeah.

40:21.260 --> 40:23.930
And to say that we rent
the caravan up there,

40:23.980 --> 40:26.530
and I talk about work occasionally,
and Nevison, the family,

40:26.580 --> 40:29.210
and that he must've picked up
on that. On what I said.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.610
And then when Ashley says
it was me, it was my idea,

40:31.660 --> 40:33.170
I just say that's a lie.

40:33.220 --> 40:36.370
Who are they going to believe?
It's my word against his.

40:36.420 --> 40:38.220
You'd never keep your nerve.

40:39.460 --> 40:41.100
It was them!

40:42.300 --> 40:43.730
What?

40:43.780 --> 40:46.380
It was them that killed
that policewoman.

40:47.380 --> 40:51.250
Those two yobs, those two animals
that work for Ashley.

40:51.300 --> 40:53.970
They were moving her,
Ann, in a van, and...

40:54.020 --> 40:55.610
That's...

40:55.660 --> 40:58.490
They got pulled over, yeah, by her,
the police officer,

40:58.540 --> 41:00.100
the one that's dead...

41:01.980 --> 41:04.450
Only cos he had a rear light out...
Oh, my God.

41:04.500 --> 41:06.770
And they killed her.

41:06.820 --> 41:08.650
They kill...

41:08.700 --> 41:11.450
They murdered
a police officer, Jenny!

41:11.500 --> 41:14.410
That wasn't part of the plan.
That was never part of the plan!

41:14.460 --> 41:19.090
And I'm not... If things...
I'm not being blamed for that.

41:19.140 --> 41:20.490
Jesus!

41:20.540 --> 41:22.450
Which is why,
I go to Nevison, I say,

41:22.500 --> 41:24.330
"I think I might know
who these people are,"

41:24.380 --> 41:27.250
and I persuade him we should
go to the police.

41:27.300 --> 41:29.410
What about the money?

41:29.460 --> 41:32.530
The money that you've got?
Ssh. I just bury it somewhere.

41:32.580 --> 41:34.900
I don't know. Why?!

41:38.420 --> 41:41.930
Why don't you just go there
and tell them the truth?

41:41.980 --> 41:43.170
The truth?

41:43.220 --> 41:46.090
Yeah. Just say that
you did what you did

41:46.140 --> 41:49.890
but you had nothing to do
with murdering this girl!

41:49.940 --> 41:51.370
No, no, Jenny. No.

41:51.420 --> 41:54.170
Why did you do it? Any of it? Why?!

41:54.220 --> 41:56.450
You know why, I've explained why.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.810
If he'd chosen to give me
just a little bit more money

41:58.860 --> 42:01.780
when I asked for it...
The girls, the girls, the girls!

42:03.220 --> 42:05.730
What use are you going
to be to them in prison?

42:05.780 --> 42:08.730
Which is why, if I say this thing to
Nevison and we go to the police

42:08.780 --> 42:11.370
and say, "I think I might know
who these people are,"

42:11.420 --> 42:13.860
it's a way out of it! Jenny!

42:16.500 --> 42:19.900
There'll probably be something
you haven't thought of.

42:27.300 --> 42:28.570
Thanks.

42:28.620 --> 42:31.770
You'll never believe who
I've left our Ryan with.

42:31.820 --> 42:35.780
Richard. Sauntered down to back yard,
did he want to play football?

42:37.500 --> 42:38.970
Wow. Yep.

42:39.020 --> 42:40.130
OK.

42:40.180 --> 42:42.010
So, how's it going?

42:42.060 --> 42:43.570
It's being dealt with.

42:43.620 --> 42:45.140
Fair enough.

42:48.740 --> 42:52.010
I went to see Tommy Lee Royce's
mother this morning.

42:52.060 --> 42:53.660
And she knows.

42:55.460 --> 42:57.690
She knows that that moron's
Ryan's dad.

42:57.740 --> 42:59.010
How?

42:59.060 --> 43:01.090
Eyes on the road.

43:01.140 --> 43:02.980
How?!

44:33.260 --> 44:35.740
They want me to kill you...

44:37.340 --> 44:41.050
..but I thought we could have a bit
of recreational activity first.

44:41.100 --> 44:42.500
Hmm?

44:50.420 --> 44:53.260
I have this thing on my mind.

44:55.220 --> 44:56.740
It's so weird.

44:59.020 --> 45:01.330
I have a son.

45:01.380 --> 45:02.900
I never knew.

45:03.900 --> 45:05.500
Eight years old.

45:06.660 --> 45:08.180
A boy, a lad.

45:11.220 --> 45:12.820
How about that?

45:14.740 --> 45:17.140
I just found out, just this morning.

45:29.380 --> 45:31.180
What do you think about that?

45:43.460 --> 45:45.940
This has just come in
from the store for you.

46:14.500 --> 46:18.930
Boss, that cocaine I took off Marcus
Gascoigne when I arrested him -

46:18.980 --> 46:20.850
it's unusable. As an exhibit.

46:20.900 --> 46:23.130
The packaging's
been damaged, apparently.

46:23.180 --> 46:25.180
It wasn't damaged
when I took it off him.

46:27.060 --> 46:31.340
These things happen.
Yeah. All right. OK.

46:34.620 --> 46:37.020
So...this is the thing.

46:39.100 --> 46:40.690
The night Kirsten died,

46:40.740 --> 46:43.770
the district commander
told me not to send it.

46:43.820 --> 46:45.730
He brought the subject up, not me.

46:45.780 --> 46:48.090
"You arrested Marcus Gascoigne,
drop it."

46:48.140 --> 46:52.010
I said I couldn't - the stuff I took
off him had gone straight into
the store at Halifax nick.

46:52.060 --> 46:54.890
He said, "Take it out." I said
I couldn't do that. And now...

46:54.940 --> 46:57.650
the results have come back saying
that the packaging was damaged

46:57.700 --> 47:00.090
and it's unusable as evidence,
and I know that it wasn't.

47:00.140 --> 47:01.860
He told you to drop it? Yeah.

47:03.100 --> 47:05.250
Well, then, I suggest
that's what you do.

47:05.300 --> 47:06.570
But...

47:06.620 --> 47:08.730
Things get damaged in transit.

47:08.780 --> 47:10.330
He told you to drop it.

47:10.380 --> 47:12.170
So drop it. That's...

47:12.220 --> 47:14.570
It's like you telling
me you've entered an address

47:14.620 --> 47:17.140
by "ways and means",
and me reckoning I haven't heard.

47:19.580 --> 47:23.420
Sometimes we turn a blind eye,
don't we? Hmm?

47:27.620 --> 47:29.020
Drop it.

47:36.100 --> 47:37.930
If his bloods come
back tampered with,

47:37.980 --> 47:40.050
I am not dropping that.
He was well over the limit.

47:40.100 --> 47:43.250
It wasn't tampered with.
It was damaged.

47:43.300 --> 47:46.260
Do you think you're letting
this get a bit personal?

48:28.420 --> 48:30.340
What did you have for your dinner?

48:32.980 --> 48:34.940
I can't remember. Think.

48:36.620 --> 48:39.090
Oh, yeah, chips. Chips?

48:39.140 --> 48:41.290
And custard.

48:41.340 --> 48:43.170
Nice(!)

48:43.220 --> 48:45.460
Nutritious...not.

48:56.620 --> 48:58.970
You wanted to see me.

48:59.020 --> 49:00.860
Put your seatbelt on.

49:02.820 --> 49:04.930
Where are you living?
Is that my son?

49:04.980 --> 49:07.490
You're not at your release
address, so where are you living?

49:07.540 --> 49:11.690
I am living there. Is that my son?
No, not according to your mother,
you're not. What were you doing at

49:11.740 --> 49:14.170
number 62 Milton Avenue? What?
What were you doing there?

49:14.220 --> 49:16.170
Not me. You were seen. I saw you.

49:16.220 --> 49:20.010
Must be somebody who looks like me.
What were you doing there?
I wasn't in there.

49:20.060 --> 49:21.370
OK.

49:21.420 --> 49:24.620
Well, we'll see, when I get the and
prints and swabs back from the lab.

49:26.820 --> 49:28.380
How come Becky's dead?

49:31.740 --> 49:35.250
I'm not talking to you
about my daughter. That's my lad.

49:35.300 --> 49:36.810
He's got nothing to do with you.

49:36.860 --> 49:39.460
You know me and your Becky
had a thing going on.

49:40.500 --> 49:42.890
You twisted little bastard.
You raped her. I didn't.

49:42.940 --> 49:44.690
Yes, you did. That's not...

49:44.740 --> 49:46.730
I know what you did to her
because she told me.

49:46.780 --> 49:48.290
You better not cross me, arsehole,

49:48.340 --> 49:51.250
because if you do, I'll chop your
dick off and I'll make
you swallow it.

49:51.300 --> 49:54.940
Is there anything I've said
you'd like me to repeat more slowly?

50:04.500 --> 50:06.090
You're my son!

50:06.140 --> 50:07.930
Ryan!

50:07.980 --> 50:10.810
I'm your dad! You're my son!

50:10.860 --> 50:12.490
I knew your mum!

50:12.540 --> 50:14.250
Who's that?

50:14.300 --> 50:16.250
It's no-one.

50:16.300 --> 50:18.380
It's a scrote, nutter.

50:19.780 --> 50:21.610
He's off his head on drugs.

50:21.660 --> 50:24.170
These people say
the first damned silly thing

50:24.220 --> 50:25.900
that comes into their heads.

50:30.700 --> 50:32.530
Did he believe you?

50:32.580 --> 50:33.970
I don't know. I don't know.

50:34.020 --> 50:36.290
He seemed to.

50:36.340 --> 50:38.130
Can he get access?

50:38.180 --> 50:40.090
I mean, if he proves...

50:40.140 --> 50:42.010
If he can prove he's his dad...

50:42.060 --> 50:43.810
God knows. Probably. Really?

50:43.860 --> 50:45.890
It won't happen. I won't let it.

50:45.940 --> 50:49.410
But legally, he might...
I couldn't give a toss, legally.

50:49.460 --> 50:52.850
But if he's saying he didn't rape
her,

50:52.900 --> 50:54.610
then it's his word against yours.

50:54.660 --> 50:56.460
It's not even his word against hers.

50:57.780 --> 50:59.970
She killed herself
because of that bastard.

51:00.020 --> 51:02.410
That is... It's not proof.

51:02.460 --> 51:04.890
It's not like that's
what he was convicted of!

51:04.940 --> 51:07.890
If he can prove that he is his,
then he will have rights.

51:07.940 --> 51:09.250
He's not gonna prove it,

51:09.300 --> 51:12.060
because I'm not gonna let him
anywhere near him.

51:20.180 --> 51:21.820
Are we being thick?

51:25.660 --> 51:27.570
Who? That cellar.

51:27.620 --> 51:31.290
In that house near the Chinese,
all the stuff you found in there.

51:31.340 --> 51:35.450
Is that not like...how you might keep
someone if you've kidnapped them

51:35.500 --> 51:36.860
and raped them.

51:38.020 --> 51:39.890
That's...

51:39.940 --> 51:41.820
I could flag it up.

51:43.780 --> 51:46.650
They could fast-track
the prints and swabs I had taken.

51:46.700 --> 51:49.170
They should pick him up.
No. God, no.

51:49.220 --> 51:51.930
If they think he's got anything
to do with Ann Gallagher,

51:51.980 --> 51:54.330
that's last thing they'll do.
They'll follow him.

51:54.380 --> 51:56.090
If they can find him.

51:56.140 --> 51:58.570
Cos he sure as hell won't be
anywhere he's supposed to be.

51:58.620 --> 52:01.410
What... Do you not think
we're onto something?

52:01.460 --> 52:03.290
Clare, the first thing
you learn in this job

52:03.340 --> 52:06.530
is not to make assumptions.
It's a short route to a cock-up.

52:06.580 --> 52:09.420
It can take your eye off
what's really going on.

52:11.180 --> 52:12.890
Hiya, Phil. It's Catherine. Look,

52:12.940 --> 52:16.900
this might be something and nothing,
but I just thought I'd flag it up.

52:18.220 --> 52:20.730
In West Yorkshire,
detectives investigating

52:20.780 --> 52:23.690
the murder of PC Kirsten McAskill
have said that as well

52:23.740 --> 52:27.250
as a white transit van, they're now
also looking for a yellow Mini,

52:27.300 --> 52:30.490
and continue to appeal to members
of the public for information.

52:30.540 --> 52:32.530
Martin Schofield reports
from West Yorkshire.

52:32.580 --> 52:35.370
Four days on from the
brutal of the brutal killing of...

52:35.420 --> 52:36.620
Oh, God.

52:48.900 --> 52:51.010
Hello? Phil?
It's Nevison Gallagher.

52:51.060 --> 52:53.490
Have you heard this on the news
about Kirsten McAskill?

52:53.540 --> 52:56.850
A yellow Mini!
That's what our Ann was driving.

52:56.900 --> 52:59.570
Shaf. You all right, Sarge?

52:59.620 --> 53:01.090
What have I missed?

53:01.140 --> 53:04.770
Oh, just three million phone calls
from people whose neighbours

53:04.820 --> 53:06.090
have got a yellow mini.

53:06.140 --> 53:07.770
How was the community meeting?

53:07.820 --> 53:09.610
The usual suspects out in force.

53:09.660 --> 53:11.370
We've got a dead police officer,

53:11.420 --> 53:14.890
and they're still more bothered
about the amount of dog shit up
Smithy Clough Lane.

53:14.940 --> 53:17.730
Listen, I'm just going to look in
on Tommy Lee Royce's mother again,

53:17.780 --> 53:20.220
all right? I shan't be long.
OK. What for? Fun.

53:31.060 --> 53:32.410
Morning.

53:32.460 --> 53:33.980
Nevison.

53:35.220 --> 53:37.620
I... I think I might know who
these people are.

53:53.100 --> 53:55.610
Who did that?
What are you doing here?

53:55.660 --> 53:58.370
He's been here,
because you gave him my message.

53:58.420 --> 53:59.690
I know that.

53:59.740 --> 54:02.290
So here's another one
I'd like you to give him.

54:02.340 --> 54:05.890
Ryan is not his son.
Ryan has got nothing to do with him.

54:05.940 --> 54:09.050
I would not waste my life dragging
up something he'd spawned.
All right?

54:09.100 --> 54:11.140
Right. So you tell him...

54:12.220 --> 54:14.850
..if he comes anywhere near our
Ryan, there'll be bother.

54:14.900 --> 54:17.530
More bother than
he knows how to handle.

54:17.580 --> 54:19.100
All right? Yeah.

54:22.820 --> 54:24.220
Did he do that?

54:25.300 --> 54:26.570
Why?

54:26.620 --> 54:27.930
Why did he do it?

54:27.980 --> 54:30.330
Cos it's Tuesday.
Cos the sun's shining.

54:30.380 --> 54:33.530
Cos he feels like it.
There is no why.

54:33.580 --> 54:36.130
Do you want me to arrest him? No.

54:36.180 --> 54:38.290
Lynn, if he's knocking you about,
I'll arrest him.

54:38.340 --> 54:40.250
Yeah, then he'll do it even worse.

54:40.300 --> 54:43.770
I don't see him for f-f-f...weeks
and then...

54:43.820 --> 54:47.570
I'll let his dog out,
that'll fucking learn him.

54:47.620 --> 54:51.650
I don't see him for weeks,
then he brings a dog,

54:51.700 --> 54:53.730
and I'm not allowed
in me own cellar.

54:53.780 --> 54:55.970
Not that I ever go in there, like.

54:56.020 --> 54:57.500
You know, but...

54:58.500 --> 55:00.730
What dog? Ohh, it's...

55:00.780 --> 55:04.370
Why's he got a dog in the cellar?
It's... Show me, Lynn.

55:04.420 --> 55:07.690
Show me. He's just looking
after it for someone.

55:07.740 --> 55:09.970
I'm in trouble now. Is Tommy here?

55:10.020 --> 55:12.930
No. Why's it padlocked?

55:12.980 --> 55:16.020
He put that on.
He's training it up for a fight.

55:17.860 --> 55:21.250
Have you heard this dog?
It's muzzled.

55:21.300 --> 55:22.700
Have you seen the dog?

55:24.620 --> 55:27.340
I don't think that's a dog
in there, Lynn.

55:35.820 --> 55:37.580
Ann?

55:46.100 --> 55:50.210
Get me out of here! Get me
out of here! Get me out of here!

55:50.260 --> 55:52.460
You're out of here. It's over. Ssh.

55:56.660 --> 56:00.010
Get me out of here!
Get me out of here!

56:00.060 --> 56:02.610
What are you doing?
It wasn't me.

56:02.660 --> 56:04.250
What are you fucking doing?!

56:04.300 --> 56:05.460
Urgh!

56:09.980 --> 56:11.260
Urgh!

56:20.100 --> 56:21.700
Argh!

56:46.020 --> 56:47.380
You bitch!

56:49.540 --> 56:51.610
You're going to be eating food
through a straw

56:51.660 --> 56:53.060
for the rest of your life.

56:55.460 --> 56:58.250
You're going to need someone
to wipe your arse for you.

56:58.300 --> 57:00.170
Oh, yes.

57:00.220 --> 57:01.740
Do you like that, you slag?

57:03.580 --> 57:05.300
Argh! Urgh!

57:06.540 --> 57:09.100
Argh!

57:12.340 --> 57:13.860
Argh! Argh!

57:34.540 --> 57:36.370
~ Get in!
~ No, no, no...

57:36.420 --> 57:38.130
Get in! No!

57:53.700 --> 57:55.620
I need an ambulance.

57:58.540 --> 58:00.930
No! Get in, get in.

58:00.980 --> 58:02.530
Get in!

58:02.580 --> 58:05.570
Don't do that. Don't do that.

58:05.620 --> 58:07.570
Don't do that!

58:07.620 --> 58:12.220
Don't do that! Don't do that!

58:16.380 --> 58:18.460
Don't do that!

58:22.460 --> 58:23.980
No!

58:25.660 --> 58:27.620
Don't do that!
