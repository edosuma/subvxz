00:02.250 --> 00:05.750
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:02.250 --> 00:05.750
<i>Stardate 43917.4.</i>

00:05.750 --> 00:08.709
<i>The</i> Enterprise<i> has been given</i>

00:05.750 --> 00:08.709
<i>the singular honor of hosting</i>

00:08.709 --> 00:10.834
<i>the first meeting</i>

00:08.709 --> 00:10.834
<i>between the Federation</i>

00:10.834 --> 00:14.417
<i>and a mysterious race</i>

00:10.834 --> 00:14.417
<i>known as the Legarans.</i>

00:14.417 --> 00:16.709
<i>We are in orbit around Vulcan</i>

00:14.417 --> 00:16.709
<i>preparing to welcome aboard</i>

00:16.709 --> 00:19.750
<i>Federation Ambassador Sarek</i>

00:16.709 --> 00:19.750
<i>and his wife, Perrin</i>

00:19.750 --> 00:21.625
<i>who, like his first wife,</i>

00:19.750 --> 00:21.625
<i>is from Earth.</i>

00:21.625 --> 00:24.125
I remember studying

00:21.625 --> 00:24.125
his career in school.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.041
The treaty of

00:24.125 --> 00:26.041
Alpha Cygnus IX,

00:26.041 --> 00:28.834
the Coridan admission

00:26.041 --> 00:28.834
to the Federation,

00:28.834 --> 00:29.917
the Klingon alliance...

00:29.917 --> 00:31.917
I met him once,

00:29.917 --> 00:31.917
many years ago

00:31.917 --> 00:34.000
very briefly,

00:31.917 --> 00:34.000
at his son's wedding.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.375
I can tell you

00:35.375 --> 00:36.667
that was quite a moment

00:35.375 --> 00:36.667
for a young lieutenant.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.375
Standing in the presence

00:36.667 --> 00:38.375
of such history.

00:38.375 --> 00:39.750
I remember he spoke to me

00:39.750 --> 00:41.041
and I just stood there,

00:39.750 --> 00:41.041
grinning like an idiot.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.709
Captain...<i> </i>

00:41.041 --> 00:42.709
<i>You</i> tongue-tied?

00:42.709 --> 00:44.583
Indeed. How do you make

00:42.709 --> 00:44.583
small talk

00:44.583 --> 00:46.166
with someone

00:44.583 --> 00:46.166
who shaped the Federation?

00:46.166 --> 00:48.583
Is it true he'll

00:46.166 --> 00:48.583
be retiring after

00:46.166 --> 00:48.583
this mission?

00:48.583 --> 00:50.542
Unofficially,

00:48.583 --> 00:50.542
that's what I hear.

00:50.542 --> 00:52.500
What a crowning

00:50.542 --> 00:52.500
achievement for his career.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.166
The benefits of relations

00:54.166 --> 00:56.875
with the Legarans

00:54.166 --> 00:56.875
are incalculable.

01:07.166 --> 01:09.583
Ah, Captain Picard.

01:09.583 --> 01:11.250
I am Ki Mendrossen,

01:11.250 --> 01:13.041
the Ambassador's

01:11.250 --> 01:13.041
chief of staff.

01:13.041 --> 01:14.291
This is Sakkath,

01:14.291 --> 01:16.125
his personal

01:14.291 --> 01:16.125
assistant.

01:16.125 --> 01:17.667
Has the Ambassador

01:16.125 --> 01:17.667
been delayed?

01:17.667 --> 01:20.375
He will be joining

01:17.667 --> 01:20.375
us momentarily,

01:20.375 --> 01:23.000
but first, we must

01:20.375 --> 01:23.000
discuss some matters

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
of the utmost delicacy.

01:29.667 --> 01:30.875
Please go ahead.

01:30.875 --> 01:32.208
To be frank, Captain,

01:32.208 --> 01:34.583
the Ambassador is

01:32.208 --> 01:34.583
not a young man.

01:34.583 --> 01:35.959
He tires easily.

01:35.959 --> 01:37.000
He's going to need

01:37.000 --> 01:38.291
a lot of rest,

01:37.000 --> 01:38.291
to prepare himself

01:38.291 --> 01:39.959
for the difficult job

01:38.291 --> 01:39.959
that awaits him.

01:39.959 --> 01:42.083
Which is why it

01:39.959 --> 01:42.083
is imperative

01:39.959 --> 01:42.083
that he be allowed

01:42.083 --> 01:43.875
to conserve

01:42.083 --> 01:43.875
his strength.

01:43.875 --> 01:46.000
I must request

01:43.875 --> 01:46.000
that you dispense

01:46.000 --> 01:47.959
with any formal

01:46.000 --> 01:47.959
activities

01:47.959 --> 01:51.000
normally associated with

01:47.959 --> 01:51.000
a visitor of his rank.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.375
We had planned

01:51.000 --> 01:54.375
a ship's concert

01:51.000 --> 01:54.375
this evening.

01:54.375 --> 01:55.875
I believe

01:54.375 --> 01:55.875
that the Ambassador

01:55.875 --> 01:58.083
is extremely fond

01:55.875 --> 01:58.083
of Mozart.

01:58.083 --> 02:00.709
I'm afraid it would be

01:58.083 --> 02:00.709
impossible for him to attend.

02:00.709 --> 02:03.709
Upon his arrival, he will be

02:00.709 --> 02:03.709
taken directly to his quarters

02:03.709 --> 02:05.458
where he will remain

02:03.709 --> 02:05.458
in seclusion

02:05.458 --> 02:07.291
until we reach Legara IV.

02:07.291 --> 02:09.667
You have my assurance

02:09.667 --> 02:12.375
that the Ambassador will not be

02:09.667 --> 02:12.375
disturbed during the voyage.

02:12.375 --> 02:15.083
That's all we ask.

02:15.083 --> 02:18.166
Well, now that's settled.

02:18.166 --> 02:19.917
The Ambassador is waiting.

02:32.250 --> 02:34.875
PICARD:

02:32.250 --> 02:34.875
Welcome aboard the<i> Enterprise,</i>

02:32.250 --> 02:34.875
Ambassador Sarek.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.208
We come to serve.

02:40.208 --> 02:42.166
Your service

02:40.208 --> 02:42.166
honors us.

02:42.166 --> 02:44.959
Allow me to present

02:42.166 --> 02:44.959
she who is my wife.

02:44.959 --> 02:46.166
Mrs. Sarek.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.375
Please call me

02:46.166 --> 02:48.375
Perrin, Captain.

02:48.375 --> 02:51.417
This is my first officer,

02:48.375 --> 02:51.417
Commander William Riker.

02:52.625 --> 02:54.375
Captain, would

02:52.625 --> 02:54.375
you be so kind

02:54.375 --> 02:55.875
as to show us

02:54.375 --> 02:55.875
to our quarters?

02:55.875 --> 02:57.333
SAREK:

02:55.875 --> 02:57.333
I prefer

02:57.333 --> 02:59.291
to view

02:57.333 --> 02:59.291
the conference room first.

02:59.291 --> 03:01.000
MENDROSSEN:

02:59.291 --> 03:01.000
Ambassador, I'm sure

03:01.000 --> 03:03.333
Sakkath and I can

03:01.000 --> 03:03.333
handle all the

03:01.000 --> 03:03.333
necessary details.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.875
I will examine it for myself.

03:08.125 --> 03:11.750
Perhaps it would be best

03:08.125 --> 03:11.750
if we settled in first.

03:11.750 --> 03:15.542
They worry about my health,

03:11.750 --> 03:15.542
Captain, too much.

03:16.959 --> 03:19.291
You will take me

03:16.959 --> 03:19.291
to the conference room, please.

03:19.291 --> 03:21.875
If you'll follow me, sir.

03:59.041 --> 04:03.625
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

04:03.625 --> 04:08.041
<i>These are the voyages</i>

04:03.625 --> 04:08.041
<i>of the starship</i> Enterprise.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.333
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

04:09.333 --> 04:13.375
<i>to explore</i>

04:09.333 --> 04:13.375
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

04:13.375 --> 04:17.667
<i>to seek out new life</i>

04:13.375 --> 04:17.667
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

04:17.667 --> 04:21.917
<i>to boldly go</i>

04:17.667 --> 04:21.917
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

05:21.166 --> 05:22.417
WESLEY:

05:21.166 --> 05:22.417
Are the Legarans

05:22.417 --> 05:23.917
really going to sit

05:22.417 --> 05:23.917
in this stuff?

05:23.917 --> 05:25.709
LA FORGE:

05:23.917 --> 05:25.709
Well,<i> I'm</i> sure not.

05:25.709 --> 05:27.291
Can you believe

05:25.709 --> 05:27.291
this smell?

05:27.291 --> 05:29.834
What smell?

05:29.834 --> 05:31.583
(<i> chuckles</i> ):

05:29.834 --> 05:31.583
What can I say?

05:31.583 --> 05:34.166
To us, it's a slime pit,

05:31.583 --> 05:34.166
but, to them, it's home.

05:34.166 --> 05:36.750
Okay, the environmental

05:34.166 --> 05:36.750
controls are ready.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.333
What's next?

05:38.333 --> 05:40.667
What, are you in some kind

05:38.333 --> 05:40.667
of a hurry or something?

05:40.667 --> 05:42.542
Yeah, I have a date.

05:42.542 --> 05:45.125
A date?

05:42.542 --> 05:45.125
With who?

05:45.125 --> 05:46.375
Ensign Dumont.

05:46.375 --> 05:47.834
Really?

05:47.834 --> 05:49.875
She's very attractive.

05:49.875 --> 05:52.834
I got to admit, Wes,

05:49.875 --> 05:52.834
though, I'm a bit surprised.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.834
What? That she'd

05:52.834 --> 05:54.834
go out with me?

05:54.834 --> 05:57.083
No, that you'd actually have

05:54.834 --> 05:57.083
the nerve to ask her.

05:57.083 --> 05:59.166
Way to go.

06:05.792 --> 06:07.792
The room is not ready.

06:07.792 --> 06:10.291
No, Ambassador.

06:07.792 --> 06:10.291
Commander La Forge

06:10.291 --> 06:11.959
and Ensign Crusher

06:10.291 --> 06:11.959
are still preparing...

06:11.959 --> 06:13.917
The Legarans are

06:11.959 --> 06:13.917
very sensitive

06:13.917 --> 06:15.333
in matters of protocol.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.792
You will remove

06:15.333 --> 06:17.792
all the furniture from the room.

06:17.792 --> 06:19.000
The walls must be bare.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.417
I'm sure everything

06:19.000 --> 06:20.417
will be set up

06:20.417 --> 06:21.834
according to our

06:20.417 --> 06:21.834
specifications

06:21.834 --> 06:23.750
before the

06:21.834 --> 06:23.750
Legarans arrive.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.709
Isn't that

06:23.750 --> 06:25.709
right, Captain?

06:25.709 --> 06:28.291
I assure you, Ambassador,

06:25.709 --> 06:28.291
everything will be ready

06:28.291 --> 06:30.375
before the conference

06:28.291 --> 06:30.375
begins.

06:30.375 --> 06:31.917
My husband and I

06:31.917 --> 06:34.834
have every confidence

06:31.917 --> 06:34.834
in you, Captain.

06:34.834 --> 06:36.125
SAREK:

06:34.834 --> 06:36.125
I have worked

06:34.834 --> 06:36.125
for 93 years

06:36.125 --> 06:37.625
in preparation for this meeting.

06:37.625 --> 06:39.250
It is<i> vital</i>

06:39.250 --> 06:41.375
that no detail be overlooked.

06:41.375 --> 06:43.375
Perhaps we should

06:41.375 --> 06:43.375
allow these gentlemen

06:43.375 --> 06:45.792
to return to their

06:43.375 --> 06:45.792
work, Ambassador.

06:48.667 --> 06:50.291
That will be acceptable.

06:56.375 --> 06:59.208
These walls are too bright.

07:12.834 --> 07:14.875
The way Mendrossen

07:12.834 --> 07:14.875
described him,

07:14.875 --> 07:16.750
I expected to see

07:14.875 --> 07:16.750
a frail old man.

07:16.750 --> 07:20.000
I hope<i> I'm</i> that frail

07:16.750 --> 07:20.000
when I'm 202 years old.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.333
But his aides did seem

07:20.000 --> 07:22.333
to be a little...

07:22.333 --> 07:23.875
overprotective,

07:22.333 --> 07:23.875
didn't they?

07:23.875 --> 07:25.500
From what I could see,

07:25.500 --> 07:27.750
the Ambassador doesn't need

07:25.500 --> 07:27.750
protection from anything.

07:27.750 --> 07:30.542
Well, we'll respect

07:27.750 --> 07:30.542
Mr. Mendrossen's request

07:30.542 --> 07:34.417
and allow Ambassador

07:30.542 --> 07:34.417
Sarek his privacy.

07:34.417 --> 07:36.709
I suppose they were

07:34.417 --> 07:36.709
foolish and vain--

07:36.709 --> 07:38.834
my expectations of this voyage.

07:38.834 --> 07:42.417
Sharing his thoughts,

07:38.834 --> 07:42.417
memories,

07:42.417 --> 07:46.792
his unique understanding

07:42.417 --> 07:46.792
of the history he's made.

07:46.792 --> 07:49.750
Does this mean you're going to

07:46.792 --> 07:49.750
cancel the concert this evening?

07:49.750 --> 07:52.583
No, the concert

07:49.750 --> 07:52.583
will go ahead

07:49.750 --> 07:52.583
as scheduled.

07:52.583 --> 07:55.375
But it's a pity our guest

07:52.583 --> 07:55.375
of honor will be absent.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.875
For all we know,

07:55.375 --> 07:56.875
the Ambassador might enjoy

07:56.875 --> 07:58.291
an evening's

07:56.875 --> 07:58.291
entertainment.

07:58.291 --> 08:00.959
Why not ask his wife

07:58.291 --> 08:00.959
if she'd like to attend?

08:02.625 --> 08:05.792
That's an excellent

08:02.625 --> 08:05.792
idea, Counselor.

08:05.792 --> 08:08.333
You have the Bridge,

08:05.792 --> 08:08.333
Number One.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.041
(<i> door chimes</i> )

08:14.041 --> 08:16.000
Come in.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.208
PICARD:

08:16.000 --> 08:18.208
I hope I'm not intruding.

08:18.208 --> 08:19.834
Not at all, Captain.

08:19.834 --> 08:23.500
But Sarek is

08:19.834 --> 08:23.500
in meditation

08:19.834 --> 08:23.500
at the moment.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.166
Actually, I came

08:23.500 --> 08:26.166
to see you.

08:26.166 --> 08:29.000
Well, how nice.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.875
I so rarely get

08:29.000 --> 08:32.875
visitors of my own.

08:32.875 --> 08:36.250
Usually everyone wants

08:32.875 --> 08:36.250
to see the Ambassador.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.959
I find that

08:36.250 --> 08:37.959
hard to believe.

08:37.959 --> 08:39.542
Thank you.

08:41.583 --> 08:45.000
These quarters are

08:41.583 --> 08:45.000
quite comfortable.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.583
The Ambassador and I

08:45.000 --> 08:47.583
were very pleased

08:45.000 --> 08:47.583
when we heard

08:47.583 --> 08:50.291
that the negotiations

08:47.583 --> 08:50.291
were going to take place

08:50.291 --> 08:52.917
aboard the flagship

08:50.291 --> 08:52.917
of the Federation.

08:52.917 --> 08:54.458
The honor is ours.

08:54.458 --> 08:58.000
My husband has taken

08:54.458 --> 08:58.000
an interest in your career.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.959
He finds it to be...

08:58.000 --> 09:01.959
satisfactory.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.333
My word.

09:03.333 --> 09:05.417
High praise from a Vulcan.

09:05.417 --> 09:09.333
Some people who expect

09:05.417 --> 09:09.333
an emotional response

09:09.333 --> 09:11.125
often find Vulcans

09:09.333 --> 09:11.125
to be quite cold

09:11.125 --> 09:12.667
when they're merely being...

09:12.667 --> 09:14.166
Logical.

09:14.166 --> 09:16.250
Exactly.

09:16.250 --> 09:18.333
I came to invite you--

09:18.333 --> 09:21.500
and your husband,

09:18.333 --> 09:21.500
if he's available--

09:21.500 --> 09:24.500
to a Mozart recital

09:21.500 --> 09:24.500
this evening.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.250
What a tempting offer.

09:29.333 --> 09:33.208
I... doubt that the

09:29.333 --> 09:33.208
Ambassador will be

09:29.333 --> 09:33.208
able to attend,

09:33.208 --> 09:36.709
but I will make it

09:33.208 --> 09:36.709
a point to ask him.

09:36.709 --> 09:39.417
Well then,

09:36.709 --> 09:39.417
I hope to see you this evening.

09:39.417 --> 09:40.667
As do I.

09:54.625 --> 09:57.000
You are still

09:54.625 --> 09:57.000
unable to meditate?

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
It is of no importance.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.166
It has eluded you

09:59.000 --> 10:01.166
for many weeks.

10:01.166 --> 10:04.083
I said it is of

10:01.166 --> 10:04.083
no importance.

10:06.333 --> 10:08.166
You know I am right.

10:08.166 --> 10:11.625
My wife, you will

10:08.166 --> 10:11.625
leave me now.

10:11.625 --> 10:14.125
I require solitude.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.041
The temperature

10:22.375 --> 10:24.041
in the tank

10:24.041 --> 10:26.041
is now 150

10:24.041 --> 10:26.041
degrees Celsius.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.166
Okay, lock it off.

10:30.709 --> 10:31.750
Is that it?

10:31.750 --> 10:33.166
Can I get out

10:31.750 --> 10:33.166
of here now?

10:33.166 --> 10:34.750
What's your hurry?

10:34.750 --> 10:36.625
You don't really think

10:34.750 --> 10:36.625
anything's going to happen

10:36.625 --> 10:38.166
with Suzanne Dumont,

10:36.625 --> 10:38.166
do you?

10:38.166 --> 10:39.625
At least I'm not

10:38.166 --> 10:39.625
spending the night

10:39.625 --> 10:41.250
with a good book,

10:39.625 --> 10:41.250
like some people.

10:41.250 --> 10:42.583
What's that

10:41.250 --> 10:42.583
supposed to mean?

10:42.583 --> 10:43.959
Just what it sounds like.

10:43.959 --> 10:45.500
Let me tell

10:43.959 --> 10:45.500
you something.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.291
You'd get more action

10:45.500 --> 10:47.291
out of a good book

10:47.291 --> 10:49.166
than you'll ever

10:47.291 --> 10:49.166
see on this date,

10:47.291 --> 10:49.166
I'll guarantee it.

10:49.166 --> 10:51.417
She's not going to waste her

10:49.166 --> 10:51.417
time on someone like you.

10:51.417 --> 10:52.542
Someone like me?

10:52.542 --> 10:54.000
She's way out

10:52.542 --> 10:54.000
of your league.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.333
Since when did you become

10:54.000 --> 10:55.333
an expert on women?

10:55.333 --> 10:57.667
Compared to you, every

10:55.333 --> 10:57.667
male on this ship

10:57.667 --> 10:59.166
is an expert on women.

10:59.166 --> 11:00.375
Well, at least

10:59.166 --> 11:00.375
I don't have to find

11:00.375 --> 11:01.500
my women in a holodeck.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.959
What did you say?

11:01.500 --> 11:02.959
You heard me.

11:02.959 --> 11:04.542
Yeah, I heard you.

11:02.959 --> 11:04.542
Just what do you think...

11:04.542 --> 11:05.667
Something wrong?

11:10.917 --> 11:14.041
I asked a question.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.250
No, sir.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.375
Nothing wrong here.

11:17.375 --> 11:19.625
May I be excused,

11:17.375 --> 11:19.625
Commander?

11:23.792 --> 11:26.208
Anything you'd like

11:23.792 --> 11:26.208
to talk about, Geordi?

11:26.208 --> 11:28.208
No, sir.

11:37.083 --> 11:38.500
I noticed that

11:37.083 --> 11:38.500
Lieutenant Worf

11:38.500 --> 11:40.625
has put Ensign

11:38.500 --> 11:40.625
D'Amato on report

11:40.625 --> 11:42.625
for insubordination.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.166
D'Amato's been

11:42.625 --> 11:44.166
an exemplary officer.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.625
Indeed he has.

11:45.625 --> 11:47.083
Could you look into it,

11:45.625 --> 11:47.083
Number One?

11:45.625 --> 11:47.083
Of course.

11:47.083 --> 11:48.166
Good evening.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.166
Good evening.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.458
I assume that the work

11:50.458 --> 11:52.166
is progressing

11:50.458 --> 11:52.166
on the conference room.

11:52.166 --> 11:53.500
Yes, I checked in

11:53.500 --> 11:55.667
with Wesley and Geordi

11:53.500 --> 11:55.667
a few hours ago.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.542
There was a moment when

11:55.667 --> 11:57.542
I actually thought

11:57.542 --> 11:59.792
the two of them

11:57.542 --> 11:59.792
were going to

11:57.542 --> 11:59.792
hit each other.

12:07.041 --> 12:09.917
Ambassador Sarek, Perrin--

12:09.917 --> 12:12.417
on behalf of the

12:09.917 --> 12:12.417
entire crew, welcome.

12:12.417 --> 12:14.208
It was my wife's suggestion

12:12.417 --> 12:14.208
that we attend.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.834
It seemed

12:14.208 --> 12:16.834
an ideal diversion.

12:16.834 --> 12:20.041
Perrin can be

12:16.834 --> 12:20.041
quite logical

12:20.041 --> 12:22.041
when she chooses.

12:22.041 --> 12:24.458
It seems that the Ambassador

12:22.041 --> 12:24.458
had more free time

12:24.458 --> 12:26.083
than I anticipated.

12:26.083 --> 12:27.875
Commander Data will be

12:27.875 --> 12:30.959
our featured soloist

12:27.875 --> 12:30.959
this evening.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.083
Data:

12:32.000 --> 12:34.083
I have been programmed

12:34.083 --> 12:36.583
to reproduce the individual

12:34.083 --> 12:36.583
musical styles

12:36.583 --> 12:38.375
of over 300 concert violinists

12:38.375 --> 12:41.625
including Heifetz, Menuhin,

12:38.375 --> 12:41.625
Grak-Tay, and Tataglia.

12:41.625 --> 12:43.667
Do you have a preference?

12:45.834 --> 12:47.709
Tataglia would be lovely.

12:47.709 --> 12:50.709
I hope you find

12:47.709 --> 12:50.709
the performance pleasing.

12:50.709 --> 12:52.959
I look forward to it.

12:52.959 --> 12:55.000
At your convenience, Mr. Data.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.166
Please.

13:07.125 --> 13:10.083
(<i> playing lively chamber music</i> )

13:36.083 --> 13:39.166
(<i> tempo slows</i> )

14:29.583 --> 14:31.667
(<i> inaudible</i> )

15:00.834 --> 15:03.333
(<i> music crescendos</i> )

15:10.208 --> 15:13.250
(<i> music decrescendos</i> )

15:13.250 --> 15:14.667
(<i> door closes</i> )

15:37.333 --> 15:38.583
Hi, Mom.

15:38.583 --> 15:40.875
I got a message

15:38.583 --> 15:40.875
you wanted to see me.

15:40.875 --> 15:43.834
I thought you were

15:40.875 --> 15:43.834
going to be at the

15:40.875 --> 15:43.834
concert last night.

15:43.834 --> 15:45.625
I said I<i> may</i> be going.

15:45.625 --> 15:47.917
Suzanne wanted to go

15:45.625 --> 15:47.917
to the arboretum.

15:49.917 --> 15:52.458
Captain Picard asked me

15:49.917 --> 15:52.458
where you were.

15:52.458 --> 15:55.333
I don't like

15:52.458 --> 15:55.333
making excuses for you.

15:55.333 --> 15:56.792
Excuses?

15:56.792 --> 15:58.709
Come on, Mom, it wasn't

15:56.792 --> 15:58.709
an official function.

15:58.709 --> 16:02.166
Listen, young man,

15:58.709 --> 16:02.166
you have responsibilities

16:02.166 --> 16:03.834
and I want you

16:02.166 --> 16:03.834
to live up to them.

16:03.834 --> 16:06.083
Don't you think you're

16:03.834 --> 16:06.083
overreacting a little?

16:06.083 --> 16:09.000
Don't talk back to me!

16:09.000 --> 16:11.166
Okay, I won't.

16:11.166 --> 16:13.041
Where do you think

16:11.166 --> 16:13.041
you're going?

16:13.041 --> 16:14.333
Away from you.

16:17.333 --> 16:21.417
And then I just slapped him.

16:21.417 --> 16:23.291
Really hard.

16:23.291 --> 16:25.959
I slapped Wesley.

16:25.959 --> 16:28.542
Do you know why

16:25.959 --> 16:28.542
you did it?

16:28.542 --> 16:30.834
I've never hit my son

16:28.542 --> 16:30.834
in his life.

16:30.834 --> 16:33.166
Beverly, this

16:30.834 --> 16:33.166
is important.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.458
What were you thinking

16:33.166 --> 16:35.458
when you hit Wes?

16:35.458 --> 16:37.500
I wasn't thinking

16:35.458 --> 16:37.500
about anything.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.875
I was just angry.

16:38.875 --> 16:41.792
And Wes didn't provoke

16:38.875 --> 16:41.792
you in any way?

16:41.792 --> 16:43.834
It wasn't anything he

16:41.792 --> 16:43.834
said or anything he did?

16:43.834 --> 16:45.500
No, that's just it.

16:45.500 --> 16:48.166
It was a sudden

16:45.500 --> 16:48.166
burst of anger.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.875
I still can't believe

16:48.166 --> 16:50.875
I did it.

16:50.875 --> 16:53.166
I don't know why

16:50.875 --> 16:53.166
you did it either,

16:53.166 --> 16:55.083
but I can tell you

16:55.083 --> 16:57.500
that I've heard

16:55.083 --> 16:57.500
the same kind of story

16:57.500 --> 17:01.333
from ten different people

16:57.500 --> 17:01.333
over the last two days.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.000
This is your

17:01.333 --> 17:03.000
command center?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.291
Yes.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.625
It is normally occupied

17:05.625 --> 17:07.291
by Captain Picard,

17:05.625 --> 17:07.291
Commander Riker,

17:07.291 --> 17:08.375
and Counselor Troi.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.250
Counselor Troi

17:08.375 --> 17:10.250
is a Betazoid?

17:10.250 --> 17:11.667
Half-Betazoid.

17:11.667 --> 17:13.250
Her father was human.

17:13.250 --> 17:15.375
Then she is not

17:13.250 --> 17:15.375
a true telepath.

17:15.375 --> 17:17.667
Her skills

17:15.375 --> 17:17.667
are empathic in nature.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.417
She is able to sense

17:17.667 --> 17:20.417
the emotions of other beings.

17:20.417 --> 17:23.709
What is Captain Picard's

17:20.417 --> 17:23.709
background in diplomacy?

17:23.709 --> 17:25.959
Extensive--

17:23.709 --> 17:25.959
the Captain's first

17:25.959 --> 17:28.667
diplomatic contact

17:25.959 --> 17:28.667
dates back to...

17:28.667 --> 17:30.458
And what of his knowledge

17:28.667 --> 17:30.458
of the Legarans?

17:30.458 --> 17:31.917
Would he be able to

17:30.458 --> 17:31.917
conduct negotiations

17:31.917 --> 17:33.417
with them, should

17:31.917 --> 17:33.417
the need arise?

17:33.417 --> 17:35.625
Do you foresee

17:33.417 --> 17:35.625
such a circumstance occurring?

17:35.625 --> 17:37.792
Is Ambassador Sarek unable...?

17:37.792 --> 17:40.417
Forgive me.

17:37.792 --> 17:40.417
I was merely exploring

17:40.417 --> 17:43.625
various possible permutations

17:40.417 --> 17:43.625
of our mission.

17:43.625 --> 17:47.083
Your tour of the Bridge

17:43.625 --> 17:47.083
has been most informative.

17:56.291 --> 17:58.458
Excuse me.

17:56.291 --> 17:58.458
We were sitting here.

17:58.458 --> 18:01.000
Well, we're

17:58.458 --> 18:01.000
sitting here now.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.041
Come on, fella,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.041
this is our table.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.333
Really?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.917
Funny, I don't see

18:04.333 --> 18:06.917
your name on it.

18:06.917 --> 18:09.083
Didn't your mother

18:06.917 --> 18:09.083
teach you manners?

18:10.959 --> 18:14.041
LA FORGE:

18:10.959 --> 18:14.041
Hey, hey, guys...

18:14.041 --> 18:15.875
is there some kind

18:14.041 --> 18:15.875
of problem here?

18:15.875 --> 18:17.792
Well, there seems

18:15.875 --> 18:17.792
to be some question

18:17.792 --> 18:19.458
as to whose table

18:17.792 --> 18:19.458
this is.

18:19.458 --> 18:23.667
Well, there are plenty

18:19.458 --> 18:23.667
of other tables, right?

18:25.583 --> 18:26.917
I suppose you're right.

18:26.917 --> 18:28.333
LA FORGE:

18:26.917 --> 18:28.333
Why don't I get everybody

18:28.333 --> 18:30.500
another round of drinks,

18:28.333 --> 18:30.500
all right?

18:32.959 --> 18:34.208
I don't have to tell you

18:34.208 --> 18:36.083
that insubordination

18:34.208 --> 18:36.083
is a serious charge

18:36.083 --> 18:37.625
to be filed

18:36.083 --> 18:37.625
against any officer.

18:37.625 --> 18:39.291
I am aware of

18:37.625 --> 18:39.291
that, Commander.

18:39.291 --> 18:40.500
However, Ensign D'Amato

18:40.500 --> 18:42.291
directly challenged

18:40.500 --> 18:42.291
my authority.

18:42.291 --> 18:43.458
Is it my imagination

18:43.458 --> 18:44.667
or have tempers become

18:44.667 --> 18:46.333
a little frayed on

18:44.667 --> 18:46.333
the ship lately?

18:46.333 --> 18:48.291
I hadn't noticed.

18:48.291 --> 18:50.166
(<i> grunting and groaning</i> )

18:56.291 --> 18:59.000
I see what you mean.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.333
Security to ten-forward.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.041
Geordi, what the hell

19:10.333 --> 19:12.041
is going on here?

19:12.041 --> 19:13.333
I wish I knew.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.709
All right, that's enough!

19:25.750 --> 19:27.542
LA FORGE:

19:25.750 --> 19:27.542
The next thing I know,

19:27.542 --> 19:30.250
somebody's left hook

19:27.542 --> 19:30.250
is on its way to my chin.

19:30.250 --> 19:31.750
(<i> sighs</i> )

19:31.750 --> 19:34.375
Captain, this is not

19:31.750 --> 19:34.375
an isolated incident.

19:34.375 --> 19:35.959
There have

19:34.375 --> 19:35.959
been reports

19:35.959 --> 19:38.500
of random violence

19:35.959 --> 19:38.500
all over the ship.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.917
Are you suggesting

19:38.500 --> 19:40.917
this is somehow contagious?

19:40.917 --> 19:43.917
There's no indication

19:40.917 --> 19:43.917
of any bacteria or virus.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.625
I've run every test I know.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.917
I've checked the water,

19:45.625 --> 19:47.917
food replicator,

19:47.917 --> 19:49.291
airborne samples...

19:49.291 --> 19:52.250
This is a hell of a time.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.667
Well, whatever it is,

19:53.667 --> 19:55.417
I don't want it

19:53.667 --> 19:55.417
to affect the Ambassador.

19:55.417 --> 19:58.166
I want his quarters isolated

19:55.417 --> 19:58.166
from the rest of the crew

19:58.166 --> 20:00.875
until we've

19:58.166 --> 20:00.875
identified the cause.

20:00.875 --> 20:03.500
It's not that

20:00.875 --> 20:03.500
simple, Captain.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.333
CRUSHER:

20:03.500 --> 20:06.333
We have determined that

20:03.500 --> 20:06.333
the outbreak of violence

20:06.333 --> 20:09.125
started at virtually

20:06.333 --> 20:09.125
the same time

20:09.125 --> 20:11.750
that Sarek and his party

20:09.125 --> 20:11.750
beamed onto the ship.

20:15.417 --> 20:17.959
We do have a working theory.

20:19.625 --> 20:21.417
We believe

20:19.625 --> 20:21.417
that it's possible

20:21.417 --> 20:23.083
that Ambassador Sarek,

20:21.417 --> 20:23.083
himself

20:23.083 --> 20:24.875
is responsible

20:23.083 --> 20:24.875
for these incidents.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.250
Sarek?

20:26.250 --> 20:28.792
I felt something

20:26.250 --> 20:28.792
during the concert.

20:28.792 --> 20:32.166
Vague and undefined,

20:28.792 --> 20:32.166
but very disturbing.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.625
He cried.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.625
I saw that.

20:34.625 --> 20:36.083
I couldn't

20:34.625 --> 20:36.083
believe it.

20:36.083 --> 20:38.875
A Vulcan moved to

20:36.083 --> 20:38.875
tears by music? It's...

20:38.875 --> 20:41.875
Well, Vulcans do have

20:38.875 --> 20:41.875
the same basic emotions we do.

20:41.875 --> 20:44.000
They've just learned

20:41.875 --> 20:44.000
to repress them.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.041
What I sensed

20:44.000 --> 20:46.041
during the concert

20:46.041 --> 20:48.166
was that he'd lost control.

20:48.166 --> 20:51.417
What would cause such

20:48.166 --> 20:51.417
a loss of control?

20:51.417 --> 20:53.417
CRUSHER:

20:51.417 --> 20:53.417
There's a very rare condition

20:53.417 --> 20:56.792
that sometimes affects Vulcans

20:53.417 --> 20:56.792
over the age of 200.

20:56.792 --> 20:58.500
Bendii Syndrome.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.792
Its early symptoms

20:58.500 --> 20:59.792
include

20:59.792 --> 21:01.500
sudden bursts

20:59.792 --> 21:01.500
of emotion

21:01.500 --> 21:03.583
mostly irrational anger.

21:03.583 --> 21:07.041
Eventually,

21:03.583 --> 21:07.041
all emotional control is lost.

21:07.041 --> 21:08.625
I can imagine nothing

21:08.625 --> 21:11.000
that would be more offensive

21:08.625 --> 21:11.000
to a Vulcan.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.709
Their emotional detachment

21:11.000 --> 21:14.709
is the very core of their being.

21:14.709 --> 21:18.250
Why would this

21:14.709 --> 21:18.250
affect others

21:14.709 --> 21:18.250
onboard the ship?

21:18.250 --> 21:21.291
Vulcans possess

21:18.250 --> 21:21.291
telepathic abilities.

21:21.291 --> 21:24.917
Sarek may unintentionally

21:21.291 --> 21:24.917
be projecting intense emotions

21:24.917 --> 21:27.166
onto other people, at random.

21:27.166 --> 21:29.458
And when the Legarans

21:27.166 --> 21:29.458
beam aboard?

21:29.458 --> 21:33.250
They could very well

21:29.458 --> 21:33.250
be affected, too.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.125
Is there a treatment?

21:37.208 --> 21:39.750
Can't someone else

21:37.208 --> 21:39.750
take his place?

21:41.625 --> 21:43.959
Sarek has built a personal

21:41.625 --> 21:43.959
relationship with them.

21:43.959 --> 21:45.959
They will accept no one else.

21:45.959 --> 21:47.750
(<i> sighs</i> )

21:47.750 --> 21:51.458
Well, how can we confirm

21:47.750 --> 21:51.458
your... diagnosis?

21:51.458 --> 21:53.125
We can grow a culture

21:53.125 --> 21:54.625
from the tissue

21:53.125 --> 21:54.625
of the metathalamus,

21:54.625 --> 21:57.417
but the results

21:54.625 --> 21:57.417
will take several days.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.959
I have 12 hours.

21:59.959 --> 22:01.625
That's impossible,

21:59.959 --> 22:01.625
Captain Picard.

22:01.625 --> 22:03.834
I cannot delay

22:01.625 --> 22:03.834
the conference--

22:03.834 --> 22:07.125
not for a day,

22:03.834 --> 22:07.125
not for an hour.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.500
The schedule itself

22:08.500 --> 22:10.917
required three months

22:08.500 --> 22:10.917
of negotiations.

22:10.917 --> 22:12.959
Nevertheless, we appear to

22:10.917 --> 22:12.959
be facing a potentially...

22:12.959 --> 22:14.667
I give you

22:12.959 --> 22:14.667
my word of honor

22:14.667 --> 22:16.917
that the Ambassador

22:14.667 --> 22:16.917
is in perfect health.

22:16.917 --> 22:18.083
Is that enough?

22:18.083 --> 22:19.208
Mr. Mendrossen...

22:19.208 --> 22:20.625
You are dealing

22:20.625 --> 22:23.500
with a theory

22:20.625 --> 22:23.500
full of holes, Captain.

22:23.500 --> 22:27.083
Why am I not affected

22:23.500 --> 22:27.083
by Sarek's supposed condition?

22:27.083 --> 22:29.458
And Perrin, how could

22:27.083 --> 22:29.458
his wife function normally

22:29.458 --> 22:32.125
if this theory

22:29.458 --> 22:32.125
of yours is correct?

22:32.125 --> 22:33.792
I cannot explain that.

22:33.792 --> 22:36.083
Hundreds of others onboard

22:33.792 --> 22:36.083
have not been affected either.

22:36.083 --> 22:37.709
I have not.

22:37.709 --> 22:39.625
It appears to be random.

22:39.625 --> 22:42.709
Proximity, apparently, has no

22:39.625 --> 22:42.709
bearing on this phenomenon.

22:42.709 --> 22:45.750
You are accusing

22:42.709 --> 22:45.750
the greatest man of his time

22:45.750 --> 22:47.583
of losing his mind

22:47.583 --> 22:50.125
on the eve

22:47.583 --> 22:50.125
of his greatest triumph

22:50.125 --> 22:53.250
and you cannot explain why.

22:57.583 --> 23:01.291
I won't report this

22:57.583 --> 23:01.291
to the Ambassador.

23:01.291 --> 23:02.875
For the moment.

23:02.875 --> 23:06.375
I don't want to divert

23:02.875 --> 23:06.375
his attention from the mission.

23:06.375 --> 23:10.750
But if I were you,

23:06.375 --> 23:10.750
in the interests of your career,

23:10.750 --> 23:12.709
I'd be very concerned

23:12.709 --> 23:15.792
about finding the real cause

23:12.709 --> 23:15.792
of these outbursts

23:15.792 --> 23:18.667
before the Legarans arrive.

23:25.458 --> 23:28.875
Mr. Data, will you please

23:25.458 --> 23:28.875
report to my ready room?

23:28.875 --> 23:30.458
Aye, sir.

23:36.875 --> 23:38.667
Captain Picard

23:36.875 --> 23:38.667
is not satisfied

23:38.667 --> 23:41.291
with Ki Mendrossen's

23:38.667 --> 23:41.291
assurances

23:41.291 --> 23:43.709
that the Ambassador

23:41.291 --> 23:43.709
is in good health.

23:43.709 --> 23:45.500
Do you consider Sarek

23:45.500 --> 23:48.667
capable of carrying out

23:45.500 --> 23:48.667
his mission?

23:52.000 --> 23:54.542
Have I given you cause

23:52.000 --> 23:54.542
to think otherwise?

23:54.542 --> 23:56.625
You have voiced certain

23:54.542 --> 23:56.625
reservations to me

23:56.625 --> 23:58.583
about his abilities.

23:58.583 --> 24:01.500
I do not recall

23:58.583 --> 24:01.500
making such a statement.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.500
Not directly, no,

24:01.500 --> 24:04.500
but you did question me

24:04.500 --> 24:06.500
about the diplomatic

24:04.500 --> 24:06.500
capabilities

24:06.500 --> 24:09.750
of both Captain Picard

24:06.500 --> 24:09.750
and Counselor Troi.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.709
I am honor-bound

24:11.709 --> 24:14.417
to help Sarek carry

24:11.709 --> 24:14.417
out this mission.

24:14.417 --> 24:17.792
That is the only

24:14.417 --> 24:17.792
answer I can give.

24:17.792 --> 24:21.291
Then you must decide which

24:17.792 --> 24:21.291
is your greater obligation--

24:21.291 --> 24:23.125
your loyalty to Sarek

24:23.125 --> 24:26.000
or your duty

24:23.125 --> 24:26.000
to the Federation.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.083
Can you accept the logic

24:26.000 --> 24:30.083
of continuing this mission?

24:32.291 --> 24:34.917
Tell your captain...

24:37.667 --> 24:40.375
the mission is in jeopardy.

24:42.250 --> 24:44.583
Sakkath has been able,

24:42.250 --> 24:44.583
until recently,

24:44.583 --> 24:47.041
to use his telepathic skills

24:44.583 --> 24:47.041
to reinforce

24:47.041 --> 24:49.917
Sarek's emotional control,

24:47.041 --> 24:49.917
thus protecting others

24:49.917 --> 24:52.125
from the effects

24:49.917 --> 24:52.125
of his deterioration.

24:52.125 --> 24:54.208
He hasn't been doing

24:52.125 --> 24:54.208
a very good job.

24:54.208 --> 24:56.083
The strain

24:54.208 --> 24:56.083
of this mission on Sarek

24:56.083 --> 24:57.709
has made it impossible.

24:57.709 --> 24:59.542
It's ironic,

24:57.709 --> 24:59.542
isn't it?

24:59.542 --> 25:03.000
All this magnificent

24:59.542 --> 25:03.000
technology, we still

24:59.542 --> 25:03.000
find ourselves

25:03.000 --> 25:05.792
susceptible to the

25:03.000 --> 25:05.792
ravages of old age.

25:05.792 --> 25:09.208
(<i> sighing</i> ):

25:05.792 --> 25:09.208
Loss of dignity.

25:09.208 --> 25:14.125
The slow betrayal of our bodies

25:09.208 --> 25:14.125
by forces we cannot master.

25:16.750 --> 25:19.166
Do you still want to

25:16.750 --> 25:19.166
be one of us, Data?

25:19.166 --> 25:21.667
Sir, it is conceivable,

25:19.166 --> 25:21.667
even for me,

25:21.667 --> 25:23.583
that time

25:21.667 --> 25:23.583
will eventually lead

25:23.583 --> 25:25.291
to irreparable

25:23.583 --> 25:25.291
circuit failure.

25:25.291 --> 25:28.291
But there is one thing

25:25.291 --> 25:28.291
I do not understand.

25:28.291 --> 25:31.792
Sarek is a logical,

25:28.291 --> 25:31.792
intelligent being.

25:31.792 --> 25:34.417
The effects of Bendii Syndrome

25:31.792 --> 25:34.417
are apparent.

25:34.417 --> 25:37.208
Why would such a man

25:34.417 --> 25:37.208
choose to ignore them?

25:37.208 --> 25:40.417
Logic fails us sometimes, Data.

25:40.417 --> 25:42.458
I think this is

25:40.417 --> 25:42.458
one of those times.

25:42.458 --> 25:45.166
I can only guess

25:42.458 --> 25:45.166
that he does not see--

25:45.166 --> 25:48.000
or he does not<i> wish</i> to see--

25:45.166 --> 25:48.000
the truth,

25:48.000 --> 25:51.375
and he is being insulated

25:48.000 --> 25:51.375
against that truth

25:51.375 --> 25:53.583
by those who love him most.

25:56.750 --> 25:58.333
Someone has to confront him.

25:58.333 --> 26:00.875
(<i> sighs, clears throat</i> )

26:00.875 --> 26:04.417
Not a task that I'm

26:00.875 --> 26:04.417
looking forward to.

26:04.417 --> 26:05.458
I don't understand this.

26:05.458 --> 26:06.583
Everyone is protecting Sarek--

26:06.583 --> 26:09.041
his wife, Mendrossen,

26:06.583 --> 26:09.041
even you.

26:09.041 --> 26:13.250
What would you have me

26:09.041 --> 26:13.250
do-- march down there

26:09.041 --> 26:13.250
and destroy the man?

26:13.250 --> 26:15.625
The mission with the Legarans

26:13.250 --> 26:15.625
cannot be carried out

26:15.625 --> 26:17.041
with Sarek

26:15.625 --> 26:17.041
in this condition!

26:17.041 --> 26:18.208
I know that!

26:18.208 --> 26:19.291
Then tell him

26:18.208 --> 26:19.291
that there is no way!

26:19.291 --> 26:20.583
Don't you tell me what to do!

26:20.583 --> 26:21.792
Captain, Commander...

26:28.250 --> 26:30.000
Of course.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.917
You're right,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.917
Number One.

26:32.917 --> 26:35.000
(<i> sighs</i> )

26:35.000 --> 26:37.917
It's a task that

26:35.000 --> 26:37.917
I will attend to.

26:43.125 --> 26:45.583
Captain, I don't think

26:43.125 --> 26:45.583
I understand

26:45.583 --> 26:47.166
what you're telling me.

26:47.166 --> 26:48.959
My husband is responsible

26:48.959 --> 26:52.375
for your crew

26:48.959 --> 26:52.375
assaulting one another?

26:54.000 --> 26:57.959
He is very ill, Perrin.

26:57.959 --> 27:01.458
Bendii Syndrome is

27:01.458 --> 27:02.875
more a folk tale

27:01.458 --> 27:02.875
than a disease.

27:02.875 --> 27:04.709
There hasn't been

27:02.875 --> 27:04.709
a true case of it

27:04.709 --> 27:06.000
in my husband's lifetime.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.291
There's one now.

27:08.291 --> 27:09.625
Sakkath knows.

27:09.625 --> 27:11.125
Sakkath?

27:11.125 --> 27:14.709
Sakkath knows nothing my

27:11.125 --> 27:14.709
husband didn't teach him.

27:14.709 --> 27:16.083
He knows.

27:16.083 --> 27:18.917
And more than that,

27:16.083 --> 27:18.917
on this mission,

27:18.917 --> 27:21.709
he has been consciously

27:18.917 --> 27:21.709
holding Sarek's mind together

27:21.709 --> 27:23.083
as well as he could.

27:23.083 --> 27:26.375
That is not true.

27:26.375 --> 27:28.417
I must see Sarek.

27:28.417 --> 27:32.709
Captain, I know a good deal

27:28.417 --> 27:32.709
about the Vulcan mind,

27:32.709 --> 27:35.166
and I know a good deal

27:32.709 --> 27:35.166
about the heart

27:35.166 --> 27:36.750
of one particular Vulcan.

27:36.750 --> 27:39.875
I am his wife

27:36.750 --> 27:39.875
and he is fine.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.458
He does not have

27:39.875 --> 27:41.458
Bendii Syndrome,

27:41.458 --> 27:43.000
and that shall

27:41.458 --> 27:43.000
be the end of it.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
I'm sorry.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Please.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.583
You mustn't do

27:45.000 --> 27:47.583
this to him.

27:49.750 --> 27:53.083
Must not do what, my wife?

27:55.875 --> 27:59.000
If Captain Picard

27:55.875 --> 27:59.000
wishes to see me,

27:59.000 --> 28:00.750
he may do so.

28:09.291 --> 28:12.375
I regret that we have seen

28:09.291 --> 28:12.375
so little of each other

28:12.375 --> 28:14.000
during this voyage, Captain.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.500
The loss is mine,

28:14.000 --> 28:15.500
Ambassador.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.667
Captain, may I talk

28:15.500 --> 28:17.667
with you in private?

28:19.417 --> 28:21.041
You were speaking

28:19.417 --> 28:21.041
of your belief

28:21.041 --> 28:23.542
that I suffer from

28:21.041 --> 28:23.542
Bendii Syndrome.

28:23.542 --> 28:27.333
I have been accused

28:23.542 --> 28:27.333
of many things in my life.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.542
Never an excess of emotion.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.375
PERRIN:

28:29.542 --> 28:31.375
Sarek...

28:31.375 --> 28:34.208
I see no reason to

28:31.375 --> 28:34.208
continue this discussion.

28:34.208 --> 28:35.667
On the contrary.

28:35.667 --> 28:37.667
I wish to assuage any fears

28:37.667 --> 28:41.583
the Captain may have

28:37.667 --> 28:41.583
regarding my capabilities.

28:41.583 --> 28:45.250
I believe there is a test

28:41.583 --> 28:45.250
for Bendii Syndrome.

28:45.250 --> 28:47.750
I will take it immediately.

28:47.750 --> 28:51.250
Unfortunately, the results

28:47.750 --> 28:51.250
would not be available

28:51.250 --> 28:54.583
for several days,

28:51.250 --> 28:54.583
which is why I must ask

28:54.583 --> 28:57.709
for a postponement

28:54.583 --> 28:57.709
of the conference.

28:57.709 --> 28:59.333
That would be a mistake.

29:01.375 --> 29:04.750
Captain, I give you my word.

29:04.750 --> 29:07.583
I am in perfect health.

29:07.583 --> 29:09.583
Then...

29:09.583 --> 29:12.917
why must Sakkath help

29:12.917 --> 29:15.375
to contain your emotions?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.959
Is what the Captain

29:19.000 --> 29:20.959
says true?

29:20.959 --> 29:24.417
No, Ambassador.

29:20.959 --> 29:24.417
Absolutely not.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.333
Perrin?

29:28.333 --> 29:31.709
Were you aware

29:28.333 --> 29:31.709
of this?

29:33.208 --> 29:37.166
Sakkath, I await an answer.

29:37.166 --> 29:40.208
I have been using

29:37.166 --> 29:40.208
my limited abilities

29:40.208 --> 29:43.375
to strengthen your

29:40.208 --> 29:43.375
mental discipline.

29:43.375 --> 29:46.458
Your efforts will

29:43.375 --> 29:46.458
no longer be required.

29:46.458 --> 29:49.333
That would not be wise.

29:51.375 --> 29:54.166
It may not be wise,

29:54.166 --> 29:57.041
but it is necessary.

30:00.208 --> 30:03.542
(<i> door opens, closes</i> )

30:03.542 --> 30:05.959
Leave me.

30:05.959 --> 30:09.208
I wish to speak

30:05.959 --> 30:09.208
with Captain Picard.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.333
Sarek, I asked you

30:09.208 --> 30:11.333
to reconsider.

30:11.333 --> 30:13.166
Obey my wishes.

30:13.166 --> 30:16.125
There is nothing to fear.

30:21.667 --> 30:24.709
(<i> door opens</i> )

30:24.709 --> 30:26.500
(<i> door closes</i> )

30:30.625 --> 30:33.583
I hope I've not

30:30.625 --> 30:33.583
embarrassed you,

30:30.625 --> 30:33.583
Ambassador.

30:33.583 --> 30:36.792
You seem to forget, Captain,

30:33.583 --> 30:36.792
that I'm a Vulcan.

30:36.792 --> 30:39.792
I'm not affected

30:36.792 --> 30:39.792
by emotional considerations.

30:39.792 --> 30:42.208
I think you are

30:39.792 --> 30:42.208
affected, sir.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.500
Far more than

30:42.208 --> 30:44.500
you realize.

30:44.500 --> 30:47.333
I am a logical being.

30:47.333 --> 30:49.291
Present your arguments.

30:49.291 --> 30:50.667
I will listen.

30:50.667 --> 30:53.417
There is an epidemic

30:50.667 --> 30:53.417
of violent incidents

30:53.417 --> 30:55.250
aboard the<i> Enterprise.</i>

30:55.250 --> 30:56.500
As we speak,

30:56.500 --> 30:58.250
the situation

30:56.500 --> 30:58.250
is worsening.

30:58.250 --> 31:01.333
And it is your hypothesis

30:58.250 --> 31:01.333
that I am the cause

31:01.333 --> 31:02.959
of these incidents?

31:02.959 --> 31:04.625
Yes.

31:04.625 --> 31:06.834
My chief medical officer

31:04.625 --> 31:06.834
has explored

31:06.834 --> 31:09.583
all other probable causes.

31:09.583 --> 31:11.917
I share your concern

31:09.583 --> 31:11.917
for your crew.

31:11.917 --> 31:13.834
However, you must agree

31:13.834 --> 31:16.458
that it is not unusual

31:13.834 --> 31:16.458
for a starship

31:16.458 --> 31:19.000
to encounter

31:16.458 --> 31:19.000
unexplained phenomena.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.333
That is correct.

31:20.333 --> 31:22.375
Therefore,

31:20.333 --> 31:22.375
since I can assure you

31:22.375 --> 31:24.625
that I am not the cause

31:22.375 --> 31:24.625
of your difficulties,

31:24.625 --> 31:26.083
the logical course would be

31:26.083 --> 31:28.875
to have your doctor

31:26.083 --> 31:28.875
continue the search.

31:28.875 --> 31:31.083
She is.

31:31.083 --> 31:33.959
It is also a fact

31:31.083 --> 31:33.959
that these incidents began

31:33.959 --> 31:36.583
shortly after your arrival.

31:36.583 --> 31:38.208
Is your entire argument

31:38.208 --> 31:40.750
to be based upon

31:38.208 --> 31:40.750
mere coincidence?

31:40.750 --> 31:42.875
Is it also coincidence

31:40.750 --> 31:42.875
that your wife

31:42.875 --> 31:45.917
and your chief of staff

31:42.875 --> 31:45.917
are carefully isolating you?

31:45.917 --> 31:49.125
Ah, I believe I see

31:45.917 --> 31:49.125
the flaw in your logic.

31:49.125 --> 31:50.709
You are reacting

31:50.709 --> 31:53.875
to their overprotective

31:50.709 --> 31:53.875
attitudes toward me.

31:53.875 --> 31:57.542
They are somewhat emotional

31:53.875 --> 31:57.542
concerning my age.

31:57.542 --> 32:00.500
Surely, Sakkath cannot be

31:57.542 --> 32:00.500
influenced by emotion.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.750
Am I to be blamed for

32:00.500 --> 32:02.750
the judgment of a child?

32:02.750 --> 32:05.166
Sakkath is young

32:02.750 --> 32:05.166
and inexperienced.

32:05.166 --> 32:08.333
He erred in his assumption

32:05.166 --> 32:08.333
that I needed help.

32:08.333 --> 32:10.166
But you needed his help

32:08.333 --> 32:10.166
at the concert,

32:10.166 --> 32:13.291
or is there possibly some

32:10.166 --> 32:13.291
other logical explanation

32:13.291 --> 32:15.583
for what happened

32:13.291 --> 32:15.583
that night?

32:15.583 --> 32:17.083
What happened?

32:17.083 --> 32:18.750
I saw you crying.

32:18.750 --> 32:20.208
I do not cry.

32:20.208 --> 32:22.125
I was there.

32:20.208 --> 32:22.125
I saw the tears.

32:22.125 --> 32:23.208
You exaggerate, Captain.

32:23.208 --> 32:24.750
I recall only one tear.

32:24.750 --> 32:27.250
So you were emotionally

32:24.750 --> 32:27.250
affected by the music.

32:27.250 --> 32:29.291
That is not possible!

32:29.291 --> 32:33.458
You still haven't answered

32:29.291 --> 32:33.458
my question, Sarek.

32:33.458 --> 32:37.125
Is it logical for

32:33.458 --> 32:37.125
a Vulcan to cry?

32:37.125 --> 32:39.291
It was late.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.125
I was fatigued,

32:39.291 --> 32:41.125
nothing more.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.125
The Legarans trust only me.

32:43.125 --> 32:46.333
They will not meet with any

32:43.125 --> 32:46.333
other member of the Federation.

32:46.333 --> 32:49.709
I must be allowed

32:46.333 --> 32:49.709
to complete my mission.

32:49.709 --> 32:51.709
There are no other

32:49.709 --> 32:51.709
logical solutions!

32:51.709 --> 32:53.792
No other logical

32:51.709 --> 32:53.792
solutions?

32:53.792 --> 32:55.458
But, Ambassador,

32:53.792 --> 32:55.458
there are always

32:53.792 --> 32:55.458
other solutions.

32:55.458 --> 32:57.333
You have said

32:55.458 --> 32:57.333
so yourself,

32:55.458 --> 32:57.333
many times.

32:57.333 --> 32:58.583
What I meant was that...

32:58.583 --> 33:00.458
Sarek of Vulcan

32:58.583 --> 33:00.458
would never be afraid

33:00.458 --> 33:02.709
of looking straight

33:00.458 --> 33:02.709
at something he did

33:00.458 --> 33:02.709
not want to see.

33:02.709 --> 33:04.291
I warn you.

33:04.291 --> 33:05.792
Your efforts to discredit me

33:04.291 --> 33:05.792
will not succeed!

33:05.792 --> 33:07.291
Sarek of Vulcan

33:07.291 --> 33:09.583
never confused

33:07.291 --> 33:09.583
what he wanted

33:07.291 --> 33:09.583
with the truth.

33:09.583 --> 33:11.834
I will not be spoken to

33:09.583 --> 33:11.834
in this manner!

33:11.834 --> 33:13.750
Do I hear anger

33:11.834 --> 33:13.750
in your voice?

33:13.750 --> 33:16.667
It would be illogical

33:13.750 --> 33:16.667
for a Vulcan to show anger!

33:16.667 --> 33:18.917
It would be illogical!

33:16.667 --> 33:18.917
Illogical!

33:18.917 --> 33:20.208
Illogical!

33:20.208 --> 33:22.041
Illogical!

33:22.041 --> 33:24.834

33:41.959 --> 33:44.417
We're entering

33:41.959 --> 33:44.417
the Legaran system, sir.

33:44.417 --> 33:46.750
Shall I have Mr. Worf

33:44.417 --> 33:46.750
contact their Ambassador?

33:46.750 --> 33:48.166
No.

33:48.166 --> 33:50.291
(<i> sighs</i> )

33:50.291 --> 33:52.291
I will present

33:50.291 --> 33:52.291
our regrets

33:52.291 --> 33:54.333
to the Legarans

33:52.291 --> 33:54.333
personally.

33:56.375 --> 33:57.959
It's vital

33:56.375 --> 33:57.959
that they understand

33:57.959 --> 34:00.166
our reasons

33:57.959 --> 34:00.166
for canceling

33:57.959 --> 34:00.166
these negotiations.

34:00.166 --> 34:01.542
Captain...

34:01.542 --> 34:03.083
(<i> sighs</i> )

34:03.083 --> 34:05.917
I think you did

34:03.083 --> 34:05.917
the right thing.

34:05.917 --> 34:07.709
But at what cost,

34:05.917 --> 34:07.709
Number One?

34:07.709 --> 34:09.208
(<i> door chimes</i> )

34:09.208 --> 34:11.250
Come.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.583
Perrin.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.875
I must speak with you,

34:12.583 --> 34:14.875
Captain.

34:14.875 --> 34:17.333
I'll be on

34:14.875 --> 34:17.333
the Bridge, sir.

34:17.333 --> 34:19.500
How is the Ambassador?

34:19.500 --> 34:22.417
Resting.

34:22.417 --> 34:23.834
I've come to ask you

34:23.834 --> 34:25.917
to reconsider

34:23.834 --> 34:25.917
your position.

34:25.917 --> 34:28.583
You know

34:25.917 --> 34:28.583
that is impossible.

34:28.583 --> 34:30.625
Sarek is a good man.

34:30.625 --> 34:33.792
He's given the Federation

34:30.625 --> 34:33.792
a lifetime of service.

34:33.792 --> 34:38.250
I beg you to let him keep

34:33.792 --> 34:38.250
the respect he has earned.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.583
He'll never lose that respect.

34:40.583 --> 34:43.750
Mendrossen and I never wanted

34:40.583 --> 34:43.750
to deceive you.

34:43.750 --> 34:46.750
My husband's condition

34:43.750 --> 34:46.750
came on him so gradually,

34:46.750 --> 34:49.166
it was easy for us

34:46.750 --> 34:49.166
to delude ourselves

34:49.166 --> 34:51.542
and pretend

34:49.166 --> 34:51.542
that nothing was wrong.

34:51.542 --> 34:53.500
We convinced ourselves

34:53.500 --> 34:56.500
that he could complete

34:53.500 --> 34:56.500
this one last task

34:56.500 --> 35:00.041
and end his career

34:56.500 --> 35:00.041
with dignity.

35:00.041 --> 35:02.583
Help him, Captain.

35:02.583 --> 35:07.166
Help him regain his pride,

35:02.583 --> 35:07.166
his honor.

35:07.166 --> 35:10.875
Believe me, it would

35:07.166 --> 35:10.875
give me great pleasure,

35:10.875 --> 35:13.750
but there is nothing I can do.

35:13.750 --> 35:16.709
The mission can be saved...

35:18.500 --> 35:20.583
but he needs your help to do it.

35:23.542 --> 35:26.458
A mind-meld...

35:26.458 --> 35:28.792
between the two of us?

35:30.583 --> 35:33.834
Do you realize

35:30.583 --> 35:33.834
the dangers involved

35:33.834 --> 35:36.375
in what you are proposing,

35:33.834 --> 35:36.375
Captain?

35:38.125 --> 35:40.000
Yes, I do,

35:38.125 --> 35:40.000
Ambassador,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.458
but I also realize

35:40.000 --> 35:43.458
the potential benefits.

35:45.417 --> 35:47.458
We would be linked

35:45.417 --> 35:47.458
telepathically--

35:47.458 --> 35:48.834
sharing our thoughts

35:48.834 --> 35:51.625
becoming, in essence,

35:48.834 --> 35:51.625
one mind.

35:53.333 --> 35:55.208
Which, for a few

35:53.333 --> 35:55.208
hours, should provide

35:55.208 --> 35:56.917
the emotional control

35:55.208 --> 35:56.917
you need.

35:56.917 --> 36:00.041
In that time, you can

35:56.917 --> 36:00.041
meet with the Legarans

36:00.041 --> 36:01.959
and conclude the treaty.

36:03.834 --> 36:08.250
It is a generous offer,

36:03.834 --> 36:08.250
but I must warn you

36:08.250 --> 36:12.083
that while I would gain

36:08.250 --> 36:12.083
your stability,

36:12.083 --> 36:15.291
you would experience

36:12.083 --> 36:15.291
the fierce onslaught of emotions

36:15.291 --> 36:18.166
unleashed by my condition.

36:18.166 --> 36:21.291
Vulcan emotions

36:18.166 --> 36:21.291
are extremely intense.

36:21.291 --> 36:23.875
We have learned

36:21.291 --> 36:23.875
to suppress them.

36:23.875 --> 36:27.083
No human could control them.

36:23.875 --> 36:27.083
They will overwhelm you.

36:27.083 --> 36:30.542
The mind-meld can be

36:27.083 --> 36:30.542
a terrible intimacy.

36:30.542 --> 36:32.875
I cannot allow it.

36:32.875 --> 36:35.875
I'm aware of the risks,

36:35.875 --> 36:38.166
but it is the only...

36:38.166 --> 36:40.750
logical solution.

36:44.625 --> 36:47.583
Your courage

36:44.625 --> 36:47.583
honors me, Captain.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.792
I can't say I approve of this,

36:50.125 --> 36:52.792
Jean-Luc.

36:52.792 --> 36:55.625
I didn't expect that

36:52.792 --> 36:55.625
you would, Beverly.

36:55.625 --> 36:57.583
I don't suppose

36:55.625 --> 36:57.583
I could talk you out of it?

36:57.583 --> 36:59.125
I'm afraid not.

36:59.125 --> 37:03.709
Though I do admit to a

36:59.125 --> 37:03.709
certain... trepidation.

37:03.709 --> 37:08.417
Your... your company

37:03.709 --> 37:08.417
is much appreciated.

37:08.417 --> 37:09.875
(<i> door chimes</i> )

37:09.875 --> 37:11.125
Come.

37:13.500 --> 37:16.000
I see that you

37:13.500 --> 37:16.000
are ready, Captain.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.291
Doctor Crusher will

37:16.000 --> 37:19.291
monitor our responses.

37:19.291 --> 37:21.333
A sensible precaution.

37:37.083 --> 37:41.125
My mind to your mind.

37:41.125 --> 37:43.834
Your thoughts

37:43.834 --> 37:47.041
to my thoughts.

37:59.333 --> 38:02.083
Commander, the Legarans

37:59.333 --> 38:02.083
are ready to beam aboard.

38:02.083 --> 38:03.166
Very well.

38:03.166 --> 38:04.542
SAREK:

38:03.166 --> 38:04.542
Number One?

38:04.542 --> 38:08.417
Please inform

38:04.542 --> 38:08.417
the Legaran delegation

38:08.417 --> 38:13.959
that Sarek of Vulcan

38:08.417 --> 38:13.959
is on his way to welcome them.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.667
Yes, Ambassador.

38:18.667 --> 38:21.417
I take it the mind-meld

38:18.667 --> 38:21.417
was a success.

38:21.417 --> 38:23.500
Yes, all went

38:21.417 --> 38:23.500
as planned.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.917
Is Captain Picard

38:23.500 --> 38:25.917
all right?

38:25.917 --> 38:28.917
Don't worry, Number One.

38:28.917 --> 38:31.542
And... the Ambassador?

38:33.041 --> 38:35.709
I am myself again.

38:35.709 --> 38:38.625
It has been a long time.

38:42.583 --> 38:44.417
No!

38:44.417 --> 38:46.250
It is...

38:46.250 --> 38:48.792
it is... wrong!

38:48.792 --> 38:50.375
It is wrong!

38:50.375 --> 38:53.208
A lifetime of discipline

38:50.375 --> 38:53.208
washed away

38:53.208 --> 38:55.291
and in its place...

38:55.291 --> 38:57.625
(<i> chuckles</i> )

38:59.417 --> 39:02.208
(<i> grunting</i> )

Bedlam!

39:05.000 --> 39:06.500
(<i> panting</i> )

39:06.500 --> 39:08.875
I'm so old.

39:08.875 --> 39:11.083
There is nothing left

39:11.083 --> 39:12.959
but dry bones...

39:12.959 --> 39:16.875
(<i> voice breaking</i> ):

39:12.959 --> 39:16.875
Dead friends.

39:16.875 --> 39:20.291
Oh... tired.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.208
Oh, so tired.

39:22.208 --> 39:25.000
It will pass,

39:22.208 --> 39:25.000
all of it.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.500
Just another hour or so.

39:26.500 --> 39:28.125
You're doing fine,

39:26.500 --> 39:28.125
just hold on.

39:28.125 --> 39:31.125
No! This weakness disgusts me!

39:31.125 --> 39:32.500
I hate it!

39:32.500 --> 39:36.333
Where is my logic?

39:36.333 --> 39:38.834
I am betrayed by...

39:40.834 --> 39:43.458
desires.

39:43.458 --> 39:46.875
I... oh...

39:46.875 --> 39:49.875
I want to feel...

39:49.875 --> 39:52.959
I want to feel

39:52.959 --> 39:56.458
everything.

39:56.458 --> 39:59.875
But I am a Vulcan.

39:59.875 --> 40:03.375
I must feel nothing.

40:03.375 --> 40:06.917
(<i> sobbing</i> ):

40:03.375 --> 40:06.917
Give me back my control.

40:06.917 --> 40:09.041
(<i> slapping table</i> ):

40:06.917 --> 40:09.041
Jean-Luc!

40:14.458 --> 40:16.625
Per...

40:16.625 --> 40:18.542
Perrin.

40:21.250 --> 40:22.959
Amanda...

40:25.166 --> 40:31.166
I wanted... to give you

40:25.166 --> 40:31.166
so much more.

40:31.166 --> 40:35.250
I wanted to show you such...

40:35.250 --> 40:39.792
(<i> gasping</i> )

40:39.792 --> 40:43.417
tenderness.

40:43.417 --> 40:47.834
But that is not our way.

40:47.834 --> 40:49.834
Spock...

40:51.750 --> 40:54.208
Amanda...

40:54.208 --> 40:56.917
did you know...?

40:58.667 --> 41:03.875
Perrin, can you know...

41:03.875 --> 41:06.125
how...

41:06.125 --> 41:09.041
(<i> sputtering</i> ):

41:06.125 --> 41:09.041
much I...

41:09.041 --> 41:11.583
love you?

41:11.583 --> 41:15.208
I... do...

41:15.208 --> 41:18.000
love you!

41:18.000 --> 41:21.250
(<i> sobbing</i> )

41:34.291 --> 41:36.291
Beverly...

41:36.291 --> 41:37.792
I'm here, Jean-Luc.

41:37.792 --> 41:39.834
I'm not going anywhere.

41:39.834 --> 41:43.583
It's... quite difficult.

41:46.417 --> 41:50.208
The anguish of the man.

41:50.208 --> 41:53.208
Despair...

41:53.208 --> 41:54.625
pouring out of him.

41:54.625 --> 41:57.333
All those feelings.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.834
(<i> sobbing</i> ):

41:57.333 --> 41:59.834
The regrets...

41:59.834 --> 42:03.625
I can't... stop them.

42:05.792 --> 42:07.083
I can't stop them.

42:07.083 --> 42:10.500
I can't. I can't.

42:10.500 --> 42:14.041
Don't even try.

42:14.041 --> 42:16.917
(<i> sobbing</i> )

aboard the<i> Merrimack</i>

42:39.667 --> 42:42.333
will be uneventful.

With the pressures

42:42.333 --> 42:44.750
of the conference behind him,

42:44.750 --> 42:47.083
I believe I can help him

42:44.750 --> 42:47.083
maintain his control

42:47.083 --> 42:48.417
until we return to Vulcan.

42:48.417 --> 42:50.166
What will happen

42:48.417 --> 42:50.166
to him then?

The effects

42:50.166 --> 42:53.750
of Bendii Syndrome

are irreversible.

42:53.750 --> 42:57.083

Aye, sir.

Thank you, Captain.

very much.

43:17.125 --> 43:19.291
I know.

43:19.291 --> 43:21.834
I've always known.

43:25.667 --> 43:29.458
I will take my leave

43:25.667 --> 43:29.458
of you now, Captain.

43:29.458 --> 43:32.917
I do not think

43:29.458 --> 43:32.917
we shall meet again.

43:32.917 --> 43:35.875
I hope you are

43:32.917 --> 43:35.875

We shall always retain

43:38.208 --> 43:42.291

43:38.208 --> 43:42.291
of the other inside us.
