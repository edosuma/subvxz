WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:03.171
- Man, it's so nice
to see you again, boy.

00:03.271 --> 00:04.238
- You too, brother man.

00:04.338 --> 00:05.806
Sure am glad I came up
to see you.

00:05.906 --> 00:07.841
- I got us something, brother,
to bring back some memories.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.077
Let me show you.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.712
- Kumbaya.
- Ho-ho-ho!

00:11.812 --> 00:14.782
The sourdough burger, boy.
- The sourdough burger.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.550
- Good way to start it
all off, right here.

00:16.650 --> 00:17.618
Mmm-mmm.

00:17.718 --> 00:18.719
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.554
Mmm.

00:20.654 --> 00:21.655
Look at yourself, man.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.491
- Sourdough so good.

00:23.591 --> 00:24.992
- I got to eat.
I'm not gonna talk.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.527
- I ain't gonna be talking
too long,

00:26.627 --> 00:28.962
'cause I bought four of 'em.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.866
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:32.966 --> 00:35.236
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:35.336 --> 00:36.737
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:36.837 --> 00:38.739
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.074
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.409
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:41.509 --> 00:43.111
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:43.211 --> 00:44.645
- You shut your face.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.814
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:46.914 --> 00:47.981
- We're back, baby!

00:51.585 --> 00:53.053
- Well, today I'm heading out
to Paramount,

00:53.154 --> 00:55.656
and my goal is to buy
some art, you know?

00:55.756 --> 00:58.259
Sometimes you go out there
and you just get stupid.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.594
But we'll leave all the
mistakes for the other buyers.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.764
I know that I'm definitely
the smartest guy I know,

01:03.864 --> 01:06.667
so it's gonna be too hard.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.402
- One thing about this
auction business--

01:08.502 --> 01:10.571
everybody wants to be
a big dog.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.706
Everybody's talking,
"I'm the big dog,"

01:12.806 --> 01:15.609
but no, Ivy Calvin--
he's the nimble cat.

01:15.709 --> 01:19.313
Meow, meow, meow, I got a unit
and you don't, big dog.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.781
That's how I work.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.616
I am the best cat on
the planet.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.718
Man, that chump
just cut off a semi.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.387
A gas semi at that.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.821
That's a fool that
want to die.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.191
Well, I guess that keeps
the population down.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.560
- So how long has ebony
and ivory been together?

01:32.660 --> 01:35.196
- Well, we--I've been
knowing him since '85.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.397
- Yeah.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.631
I met him in college.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.032
- We played football
together out there.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.335
- Yeah.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.770
- '86, '87, '88, '89,

01:42.870 --> 01:43.937
he didn't know when
he gonna leave.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.974
- I just loved the food.

01:47.074 --> 01:49.777
- I'm in Paramount, California
today for our auction,

01:49.877 --> 01:52.413
and I found out that
Paramount is not,

01:52.513 --> 01:55.683
as you would've expected, where
Paramount Pictures was founded.

01:55.783 --> 01:59.119
It's actually the originator
of the Zamboni.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.155
Like, the ice machine.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.257
I don't know, I thought
that was really weird.

02:03.357 --> 02:06.627
'Cause, like, it's California.
There's no ice here.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.496
You got a store or something?

02:08.596 --> 02:10.063
- No, I'm all app-based.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.832
Me and a couple buddies--
easy to get rid of everything.

02:11.932 --> 02:12.833
- You know, easy to make

02:12.933 --> 02:14.134
a quick profit.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.769
I run my business
from my phone.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.705
I'm doing things that these
old guys would never think of.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.673
I kinda dropped one on Mary
the other day.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.141
- Uh-huh.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.643
- 'Cause a person tell me they
dropped a unit on somebody,

02:22.743 --> 02:24.011
I thought to myself, "Hmm,

02:24.111 --> 02:25.446
did they drop it
or did it get taken?"

02:25.546 --> 02:26.814
- Yeah, I dropped
a unit on her.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.081
- Okay. Dave don't look
like he believe you.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.418
- Wasn't there.
I couldn't see it.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.719
I have to say,

02:31.819 --> 02:33.153
Justin reminds me
of a young me.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.623
That's how I know
he's full of .

02:36.957 --> 02:38.392
What's up, sweetcakes?
How you doin'?

02:38.492 --> 02:39.727
- This is my friend Anthony.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.094
- Anthony.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.796
- Eight. We have eight units.
- That's perfect.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.164
Two, four, six, eight.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.400
- I want number one and five.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.703
- One through eight.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.640
- All righty, guys, thank you
for coming out today

02:52.740 --> 02:53.907
to Paramount Self Storage.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.643
My name's Emily.
I'm your auctioneer today.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.044
Once I go in, I'm gonna
open the door.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.946
You can't look, you can't--
er, you can look,

02:59.046 --> 03:00.514
can't touch anything,
and you can't go in.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.115
You will all get
a chance to look.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.984
Are you guys ready?
'Cause I am. Let's go.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.286
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

03:05.386 --> 03:08.256
*

03:08.356 --> 03:11.091
* We got some tubs in there

03:11.191 --> 03:13.461
*

03:13.561 --> 03:15.296
- This unit is old.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.830
I don't know, I see
a new toaster,

03:16.930 --> 03:18.266
but that's pretty much the only
thing that's in it, so...

03:18.366 --> 03:20.934
- There's a lamp,
there's a little boom box.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.305
And, uh--hey guys, is that
a chicken fryer right there?

03:24.405 --> 03:25.606
- I saw the Rolex
in the back.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.241
- He didn't see no damn Rolex.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.576
- I don't think this one's
for me.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.478
I'm--I'm buying smart today.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.313
- See the third grade speakers.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.182
- Stereo system ragged.
- You got two vacuum cleaners.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.818
But they're clean runs
in this house.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.152
- Seven or eight totes.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.788
Three or four boxes.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.923
Got to be at least 100,
150 bucks in here.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.858
The big cat needs
a better locker.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.760
And I'm talking right meow.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.329
- This unit, you can talk
about it all you want, Kenny.

03:48.429 --> 03:49.497
- I ain't seen no clothes
in there.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.864
I seen vacuum cleaners.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.433
- You didn't see that
brand new Rolex in there?

03:52.533 --> 03:53.967
- Sure, pal.
- All righty, guys.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.803
First unit,
this is five by six.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.472
Easy money, easy loading.
Elevator's right there.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.140
100.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.346
- 25.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.480
25, now 30.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.452
30, now 30?

04:11.552 --> 04:12.853
25, 30?

04:12.953 --> 04:15.523
Sold it to you. $25.
Kenny got it.

04:15.623 --> 04:16.724
I didn't really want it.

04:16.824 --> 04:20.027
But damn, how bad can
a $25 locker be?

04:20.127 --> 04:21.329
- I guess Kenny likes trash.

04:21.429 --> 04:22.663
I know what he looks for.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.767
- Got another five by five.

04:26.867 --> 04:30.804
*

04:30.904 --> 04:32.440
You can make some money
off the shoe shine box.

04:32.540 --> 04:33.774
- Got the Speed Racers.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.643
- Speed Racer.
- Some toys right here.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.911
You got some containers,
you got some mattresses

04:38.011 --> 04:39.279
with the--
I don't know about that.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.948
That's old.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.350
- Nothing special.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.485
I just don't think this
is a smart move today.

04:44.585 --> 04:48.689
I'll have to leave this
to the less--less intelligent.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.091
- This is a mystery.
Everything's a big cluster.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.627
We got a few bins and nice
little end table over there.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.095
I might have to throw
a few dollars in

04:55.195 --> 04:56.664
to see what happens.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.432
- Got a few little toys,
which is kinda cool.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.801
Plywood, which you don't
usually see in a unit.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.836
I still don't quite like it.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.506
- All righty, guys,
what do you say $25?

05:05.606 --> 05:06.807
- Right here.
- 30!

05:08.241 --> 05:09.943
35 now, 40...
- Yup!

05:10.043 --> 05:11.612
50!

05:11.712 --> 05:13.447
- Yup!
- 55 and 60.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.351
- Yup!
- He saying, "Yup."

05:17.451 --> 05:19.387
- Imitation is the best
form of flattery.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.090
Sold it to you for $70.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.225
- I didn't say "yup."
I said "yeah."

05:25.325 --> 05:26.727
- You said "yup."

05:26.827 --> 05:28.161
- Yeah.
- Hey, everybody wants to--

05:28.261 --> 05:31.164
they want to bid like me,
they want to buy like me.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.766
- I don't need to imitate
anybody.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.201
I won this locker
and I'm ready to see

05:34.301 --> 05:35.569
if it has the wow factor.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.270
*

05:37.371 --> 05:39.773
Nice little radio here, so...

05:39.873 --> 05:41.709
So it is in the box.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.276
$15 radio here.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.913
All right. Looks like we
have a fan here,

05:46.013 --> 05:47.681
a very fancy fan.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.383
It's not in too bad
of a shape.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.218
So I need to sell this
for about $25

05:51.318 --> 05:52.586
just to get rid of it quick.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.688
This is actually pretty nice.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.356
*

05:56.457 --> 06:01.261
See what's inside of it first.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.664
Oh, what the...!

06:03.764 --> 06:05.032
Cadillac hood.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.767
Got the hood ornament
on the top of a Cadillac.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.101
I don't know too much
about these things.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.703
It actually looks really
nice, in good shape.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.371
So this is something that I
would want to get checked out,

06:11.472 --> 06:12.606
just so I could see
how much it's worth.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.842
*

06:14.942 --> 06:16.710
Oh, so you actually have
the things that go on

06:16.810 --> 06:18.746
the back of the car.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.648
Something else, too,
for Cadillac.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.082
So I'm gonna go put that
to the side, too,

06:22.182 --> 06:23.316
'cause this stuff--
it's pretty cool stuff.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.852
I don't know how much
it's worth.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.954
You know, it looks like
it would go to an older model,

06:27.054 --> 06:28.722
so I'll put this
to the side and see--

06:28.822 --> 06:30.323
get that thing checked out too.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.059
*

06:32.159 --> 06:33.827
Oh. Got a bag in here.

06:33.927 --> 06:38.065
It's empty, besides that.
But it's a pretty nice bag.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.567
Beverly Hills, Ricardo.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.334
$25 on the bag.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.103
Things like these--
these sell for me.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.472
Real quick.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.840
We'll put this at $30.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.375
This one too, another $30.

06:48.476 --> 06:51.612
*

06:51.712 --> 06:55.048
Got some good-lookin' sweaters.
Leather jackets.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.450
I'd say with these clothes
right here,

06:56.550 --> 06:57.651
these jackets,

06:57.751 --> 06:58.886
$200 in this bag.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.388
Got a little mini
foosball table.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.923
I'm gonna post this up
right now.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.459
Post it up, it'll be gone
in a snap.

07:05.559 --> 07:09.763
*

07:09.863 --> 07:12.265
- So we got a--looks like
a shoe-shining kit.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.667
I don't really need
a shoe-shining kit,

07:13.767 --> 07:15.703
because I keep my shoes
looking good.

07:15.803 --> 07:19.006
But yeah, some paintbrushes.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.874
Paintbrush.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.477
Yeah, I don't think that this
is what this is used for.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.779
We'll go $30 on the box.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.949
All right, so it looks like
we have a speaker here.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.121
Oh, snap. That foosball table
just sold.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.856
$20 in the bank.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.892
We'll go 25 bucks on the
speaker just to get rid of it.

07:38.992 --> 07:39.927
We got a bed set here.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.495
Will sell for 100 bucks.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.196
Now all I got to do
is put the stuff back

07:43.296 --> 07:46.534
and get back to the auction
and make more money.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.702
- Here we go.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.270
Whoo!

07:50.370 --> 07:52.405
*

07:52.506 --> 07:54.307
- This is a nice-looking unit.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.209
It's kind of deceiving,
because you got

07:56.309 --> 07:57.477
a big three-piece cabinet.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.947
It takes up literally
half the room.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.949
And about 35 boxes in here.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.552
This would definitely be a
smart buy for the right price.

08:04.652 --> 08:05.886
*

08:05.986 --> 08:07.054
- All these tubs, you know--

08:07.154 --> 08:08.321
it's a nice little
mystery unit.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.322
I know it's something that
David's probably

08:09.422 --> 08:10.791
gonna want to go for.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.225
So I might throw a few bids
and see what happens.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.326
- Can't afford it, son.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.662
- We'll see how deep
your pockets go.

08:14.762 --> 08:15.863
- Okay.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.064
- I like that it's
neatly packed,

08:17.164 --> 08:18.832
but I really--
ooh, wait a minute.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.801
There's a jewelry box right
there; that means gold.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.770
So you know what?

08:22.870 --> 08:24.271
This is my fat rat,

08:24.371 --> 08:25.372
and I'm the big, buff cat.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.207
- They got some nice bins.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.042
That's the kind of stuff you
get all the hidden treasures

08:29.142 --> 08:30.143
in here.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.378
Keep an eye on Ivy and Dave.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.580
- Yeah, I see how they bid.
- Yeah.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.914
- All righty, guys.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.148
What you've all been
waiting for.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.149
Good stuff, antiques.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.150
What do you say 500?

08:39.219 --> 08:40.854
200! Now 250.
- Yup!

08:42.590 --> 08:44.024
300, 400.
- Yeah!

08:44.124 --> 08:45.559
Now 450.
- Yup!

08:45.659 --> 08:46.960
500...
- Yeah!

08:48.195 --> 08:49.129
Saw that.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.263
- Yup!
- 600!

08:50.363 --> 08:51.899
Now 650.
- Yup!

08:51.999 --> 08:54.635
750...
You got caught.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.403
He got caught.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.271
- Man, looks like the cat's
out of the bag.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.707
750...
- Yeah!

08:59.807 --> 09:00.708
800!
- No chance.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.475
- Yup!

09:02.576 --> 09:04.244
Now 850!
- Yeah!

09:04.344 --> 09:05.746
- Yup!
- 900, 950...

09:05.846 --> 09:07.380
- Yeah!
- Now $1,000.

09:07.480 --> 09:08.782
- Yup!

09:08.882 --> 09:09.783
.

09:09.883 --> 09:10.984
- I'm out of it.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.820
- Now 1,100.
- That's how you drop it.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.354
- Sold it to you, Dave.
- You didn't drop it.

09:14.454 --> 09:17.057
I took it.
- $1,000, and Dave got it.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.959
- Take some notes, son.
- Sucker.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.763
- Argh!
- She need help.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.665
I'll help the young lady
right here.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.635
Oh, no.
- Oh, no. A trailer in there.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.136
- They got a whole truck
in there.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.805
*

09:31.905 --> 09:35.175
There should be a law what you
can put in units these days.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.710
What are you trying
to hide in here?

09:36.810 --> 09:39.579
He got a living room in here.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.281
Man, this is terrible.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.750
- This is too much work.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.818
- I'm not--in this sun
right now...

09:44.918 --> 09:46.519
I'm not moving that much.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.855
Not for me.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.690
- You got a pooper-scooper,
a couple barrels.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.859
Only an idiot would
buy this room.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.227
- This is what you call
a storage nightmare.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.529
I don't care what you pay;
it's gonna be a bad buy.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.598
But, you know, there are people
less intelligent

09:58.699 --> 10:00.067
that might buy it.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.502
- Sorry, Emmlick.
Start off at a dollar, girl.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.237
- He gave you a dollar
right there.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.538
- No, I didn't! No, no!
- Take his dollar.

10:05.639 --> 10:06.539
- No, brother!
- He said, "Start me off

10:06.640 --> 10:07.975
at a dollar."

10:08.075 --> 10:09.342
- No, brother, you can't--
- That's what I heard.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.744
- No, no, no.
- "Start me off at a dollar."

10:10.844 --> 10:11.812
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You can't do that.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.013
- Rookie mistake.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.014
That's a legal bid.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.015
- No! No, it ain't.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.383
- You put a dollar on it!

10:16.483 --> 10:17.818
You better bid--
you gonna make your money back.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.219
- Nothing, nothing.
- All righty, guys,

10:19.319 --> 10:21.655
here you go,
nice little camper

10:21.755 --> 10:22.890
and construction unit.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.491
And I got a dollar from Kenny.

10:24.591 --> 10:25.959
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah, Kenny!

10:27.227 --> 10:29.129
is that?

10:29.229 --> 10:30.764
- Got to bump up
your cost.

10:31.899 --> 10:32.866
- Somebody feel sorry for me.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.634
- No! I don't have it!

10:36.236 --> 10:38.071
- No!
Oh, my God, brother.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.507
- Anybody else
want to be $10?

10:40.607 --> 10:41.709
- No!
- I'm gonna help Kenny out

10:41.809 --> 10:43.076
and not bid.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.050
Did anybody want to be $5?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.285
- No, no, no.
Somebody want it.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.620
- You bought it!
- No!

10:53.721 --> 10:55.823
- Sold it to you, Kenny! 1$!

10:55.923 --> 10:57.390
- You bought it by mistake.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.059
Messed up, brah.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.695
Oh, man, I was trying
to help you out, girl!

11:01.795 --> 11:03.864
- We have a word
for that in Spanish.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.332
Pendejo.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.769
am I gonna do
with that bull?

11:08.869 --> 11:10.637
- All righty, guys.
Thanks for coming.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.105
That's gonna do it for today.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.540
Please make sure and come
and pay me

11:13.640 --> 11:15.575
before you start loading up
and getting ready to go.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.210
- I didn't get a locker today,

11:17.310 --> 11:20.313
but at least I didn't get stuck
with that piece of garbage.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.115
- I thought you was
my friend, brah.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.383
This is bull.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.019
- Last time you do
something like that.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.755
- If I tell my wife
about this ,

11:27.855 --> 11:29.857
she gonna beat my ass up.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.494
*

11:34.594 --> 11:35.963
- All right,
start lining up boxes.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.697
Just bring 'em down here
and start ning 'em up.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.467
Anytime I get a unit that's
this clean and organized,

11:40.567 --> 11:41.902
I never fail to make a profit.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.237
Jigsaw puzzle.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.506
Bed. Dolls.

11:46.606 --> 11:47.975
And about 20 bucks there.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.643
20 bucks in this
little rocking chair.

11:50.744 --> 11:54.247
A brand new--brand new,
heavy fire extinguisher.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.116
That's about 50 bucks
right there.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.819
We got Christmas ornaments.
Oh, no, dinner plates.

11:58.919 --> 12:02.222
25 bucks. Wow, look at that.
Another fire extinguisher.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.224
Another fire extinguisher.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.859
100 bucks for those two.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.895
You got $30 in books.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.898
And poker set. 20 bucks.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.399
More books, more books.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.934
50 dollars in books.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.469
This is probably a pitcher
for tea or--

12:16.569 --> 12:17.871
oh no, it's a stemware set.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.707
25 bucks. Well,
everything's clean.

12:20.808 --> 12:23.710
But there's just no bi
money items.

12:23.811 --> 12:26.379
So far, my smart buy
is looking pretty dumb.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.882
Back in the day, when oak
was popular,

12:28.982 --> 12:30.918
this was probably about
1,000 bucks.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.119
Look at this. This is like--

12:32.219 --> 12:33.553
this is all made out
of solid wood.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.989
You know, nobody appreciates
it, though, today.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.992
You got
a three-piece wall unit. $400.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.028
Little baby shoes.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.729
Eh, baby Jordans.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.965
Oh yeah, these are little
baby Jordans too.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.934
Kinda cool. Converse.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.501
*

12:48.601 --> 12:52.072
Nikes. More Jordans.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.706
Jordans. Believe it or not,

12:53.807 --> 12:55.542
this is probably an easy $200

12:55.642 --> 12:57.710
just in the baby Jordans
right there.

12:57.811 --> 13:00.814
More clothes.
Eh, $40 in clothes.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.883
We got a spoon collection here.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.617
40 bucks.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.586
Now, here we might
have something.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.688
'Cause you know, I definitely
like to march

13:08.788 --> 13:10.357
to the beat of my own drum,

13:10.457 --> 13:12.359
so... This is actually
very cool.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.394
You'd have a rope, I think,
hanging right here.

13:14.494 --> 13:17.164
Definitely something I might
need to get looked at.

13:17.264 --> 13:20.433
Obviously, there's nothing
fantastic in here.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.035
I've just about broken even.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.804
And somehow, I got to make
a profit off this drum.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.306
Jose, you get this
stuff loaded.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.607
I'm out of here.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.410
- I got tricked with this unit.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.912
It ain't like I
wanted this unit.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.981
- That's all you.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.549
- I wanted to impress Anthony
today to show him what I do.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.919
Now I'm embarrassed.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.122
Oh, my God.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.057
- What the hell is
this bull, bro?

13:44.157 --> 13:45.658
- Who knows what's
in there, man.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.427
Who knows who's in there.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.561
!

13:50.030 --> 13:51.031
You're reaching now, man.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.765
There ain't nothing.
Cut your losses.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.367
Got a dresser, huh?

13:54.467 --> 13:56.603
- I got a feeling this
a booby trap, bro.

13:56.703 --> 14:00.107
*

14:00.207 --> 14:01.909
Mm-mm.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.176
- Hell no.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.844
Look at you.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.280
- Hot paprika.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.481
What are you cooking?

14:08.581 --> 14:10.817
That's it, bro.
- That's it, man.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.119
Call the junk man.
Call the junk man.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.553
Call him now.

14:13.653 --> 14:16.023
*

14:16.123 --> 14:17.424
Thank God I got
another locker.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.359
It can't be no worse
than this one.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.560
Right?

14:20.660 --> 14:23.196
*

14:23.296 --> 14:24.831
All right!

14:24.932 --> 14:27.901
All right. Can't believe I paid
$25 for this here.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.970
- That's 24 too much, I think.

14:30.070 --> 14:33.573
The lamp, it got
the light still in it.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.108
- Aluminum on it.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.944
- This here could probably
go, let me see...

14:37.044 --> 14:39.179
About $3 for this.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.748
Ooh, leaning--
leaning pizza.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.286
- Got a table in here
coming out.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.957
- Ooh, you got
a table right here.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.059
- That's a seasoning table.
You chop up everything.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.027
You could probably get
about 3$ for this.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.328
- That might get you something.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.529
- Yeah, you put some
gabe-orade in here.

14:56.629 --> 14:57.764
- Gatorade, right there.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.499
- $10 bucket for that
thing right here.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.168
- That's how you're gonna
get your money back right here.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.369
You keep playing this thing.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.171
- Probably be like $2.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.472
Gimme something good.
You digging, boy.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.739
- I'm looking.

15:06.839 --> 15:07.975
- Hey, this might be
worth something.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.243
Might be a couple dollar bills,
like 10.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.579
The New English Bible.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.581
Then He began to teach them.

15:14.681 --> 15:18.651
Never bid on a unit
that has 12 items in it.

15:18.751 --> 15:19.987
And never trust Emily,

15:20.087 --> 15:21.821
'cause you look at her
one time,

15:21.921 --> 15:23.623
and you then bought the unit.

15:23.723 --> 15:24.691
Mark 11.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.360
- * Save my soul

15:27.460 --> 15:28.395
Abracadabra.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.662
Abba-ka-wishes.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.531
Lord, please let there
be something in here

15:31.631 --> 15:32.865
that make our money.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.734
- One time.
- One time for the money.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.836
- Hit it one time. Three.
- Draw for the one.

15:36.936 --> 15:40.473
- Here we go!

15:40.573 --> 15:41.841
is this?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.143
It ain't working.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.544
- Drawer number two.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.313
- Please, let's hit something.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.814
- Uh-oh.
- Okay, you never know.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.649
Let's see what we got here.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.751
It's empty.
It feels empty.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.021
- I can tell that box
was five bucks.

15:54.121 --> 15:57.657
The light for the door, so
Jason won't come to your house.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.592
I'll probably get about
10 bucks for this.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.828
- Nothing in here
worth anything.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.763
- This is not what
I expected, bro.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.698
All I made was 17 bucks today?

16:05.798 --> 16:08.835
That don't even cover
the sourdough.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.770
This wasn't a good day.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.307
*

16:14.407 --> 16:15.708
- I appreciate you
taking me here, Ivy.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.877
- Oh, anytime.
- I know a lot of things,

16:17.977 --> 16:19.346
but not when it comes
to vintage car parts/

16:19.446 --> 16:22.149
So Ivy's doing me a solid by
taking me to his Cadillac guy.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.551
- He is the nicest,
most politest,

16:24.651 --> 16:26.053
coolest dude you ever
want to meet,

16:26.153 --> 16:27.354
and he got deep pockets.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.189
I mean, when it comes
to Cadillac guys,

16:29.289 --> 16:30.557
he's the man.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.225
- Look at this.
This is pitting.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.726
- That ain't pitting;
that's character.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.228
- No, it's not.
It's pitting.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.198
You haven't got $50 right there
with all this junk.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.167
- Now, if I had to suffer
through Cadillac Frank's,

16:40.267 --> 16:43.103
then everybody should.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.904
No doubt in my mind.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.840
This'll be an experience
for you to remember.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.709
Frank!
You here?

16:49.809 --> 16:51.044
- Got a new guy.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.180
Got to show you some stuff.
- Justin.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.283
- So I got some Cadillac pieces
I found in a unit.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.185
I'm hoping you can show me
some good dollar signs here.

16:58.285 --> 16:59.886
- Let me see.

16:59.986 --> 17:01.288
I don't know where
you dug this up,

17:01.388 --> 17:02.355
but you ought to bring it back.

17:02.455 --> 17:03.590
It's already partially broken.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.824
How you gonna put these on?

17:04.924 --> 17:07.060
This is supposed to have
little pivots on it.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.561
And it hasn't got 'em.
It's worthless.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.597
Now you want to shaft me
with these? No.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.165
I can't believe you're
trying to sell this.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.866
Aren't you ashamed?
- Heh.

17:13.966 --> 17:16.103
What does this mean?

17:16.203 --> 17:17.504
- I don't know, Frank.

17:17.604 --> 17:18.805
Okay, so what about my
other stuff here?

17:18.905 --> 17:19.972
- I don't know, let's see
what it is.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.608
Well, this is not too bad.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.111
It's a coat of arms
for  Cadillac.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.545
Yeah, you got
the Merlettes here.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.779
- The more ducks,
the more money.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.448
- They're not ducks.
They're Merlettes.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.782
- How much can I get
for the ducks?

17:29.882 --> 17:31.584
- Merlettes.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.087
- I'd say 100.
- Hey, that's big ducks to me.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.555
- They're Merlettes.
- All right.

17:35.655 --> 17:36.556
This is the best part
right here.

17:36.656 --> 17:37.690
- Yeah, I know.

17:37.790 --> 17:38.691
- I'm hoping for at least
2 grand.

17:38.791 --> 17:39.892
!
- Yeah.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.228
- You can get a kidney
transplant for that.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.229
What are you talking about?

17:42.329 --> 17:43.830
Who shined this, you?

17:43.930 --> 17:45.265
- Yeah, I did it myself.
Buffered it.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.833
- It looks like it.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.568
Well, I think you can get
a couple hundred bucks for it.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.503
! You must like him
better than me.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.505
- The stuff that you
brought here was crap.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.974
!

17:55.074 --> 17:56.543
- Find your own way home.
Frank, he need a ride home.

17:56.643 --> 17:57.877
- I'll take a ride
in one of these...

17:57.977 --> 18:00.280
- See ya, Justin.
- Miraculous Cadillacs here.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.149
He's jealous.

18:02.249 --> 18:07.620
*

18:07.720 --> 18:09.189
- I need to get my drum
checked out.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.490
So I'm meeting Stan and Jerry

18:10.590 --> 18:12.225
at their professional
drum shop,

18:12.325 --> 18:13.860
called Professional Drum Shop.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.563
*

18:16.663 --> 18:18.030
Looks like if I'm interested
in drums,

18:18.131 --> 18:19.266
I came to the right place.

18:19.366 --> 18:20.967
- Drums-R-Us.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.703
- So this is the drum we talked
about on the phone.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.605
- Wow.
- Got a brass shell.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.375
Well, these markings, Jerry,
look like English?

18:28.475 --> 18:29.876
- Yeah, English.
- Military.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.145
- Yeah, this looks like a drum
that was manufactured

18:32.245 --> 18:35.448
by a company called
Boosey & Hawkes.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.185
And this particular one,
being a brass shell,

18:38.285 --> 18:40.820
they were one of the first
to incorporate brass

18:40.920 --> 18:42.322
into the snare drums.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.891
They were always wood
to the 1700s up to the 1800s.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.859
So this is--this is a very
early brass--

18:46.959 --> 18:48.895
- Yeah, 1900s.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.530
- Yeah. That's the little
hook that,

18:50.630 --> 18:53.300
you know, for marching, you
would hook it through your belt

18:53.400 --> 18:55.202
and it would hang onto it,
so it'd be--

18:55.302 --> 18:56.569
you'd be marching, you know,

18:56.669 --> 18:57.670
fuh-d-d-d-dong,
fuh-d-dong.

18:57.770 --> 18:58.671
- To war.
- Yeah, right to war.

18:58.771 --> 18:59.806
Right to your death.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.140
You're playing the drum.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.709
- Yeah, exactly.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.611
That's what that little device
is there right there for.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.546
- So let me ask you,
what are these for?

19:06.646 --> 19:08.815
Is this, like, you play it
like a--

19:08.915 --> 19:10.350
- No, you don't.
Stop that, Dave.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.984
- That's what gives that buzz.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.621
Those are gut snares,
is what they call 'em.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.457
It's usually from the
intestines of an animal,

19:17.557 --> 19:20.260
that they roll up and make,

19:20.360 --> 19:22.462
and then it gives it
that snare drum effect.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.931
- So what is a drum
like this worth?

19:25.031 --> 19:27.834
- Well, Dave,
I mean, it's...

19:27.934 --> 19:29.202
It's all there.
- Yeah.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.704
- The condition it is,
being over 100 years old,

19:31.804 --> 19:33.840
I would say probably...

19:33.940 --> 19:37.076
- Still playing.
- I would put it at...

19:37.176 --> 19:38.511
- Go ahead, Jerry.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.413
- $500.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.048
- It's in great shape.

19:42.148 --> 19:44.116
- Yeah, it's all there,
and it's amazing.

19:44.217 --> 19:47.119
- I made 500 bucks on it,
and I can carry it in one hand.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.655
- That's right.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.524
announcer: Justin Bryant
took home the big ducks.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.725
- They're Merlettes.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.928
- And revved up a profit
of $730.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.298
Dave Hester's military drum

19:58.398 --> 20:00.867
snared 520 big ones.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.970
Kenny Crossley was not
a happy camper,

20:04.070 --> 20:06.439
barely making 17 bucks.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.408
And Ivy Calvin
left the auction

20:08.508 --> 20:09.642
a grumpy cat.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.077
But don't worry,

20:11.177 --> 20:12.712
he'll land on his feet.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.213
- Hey, Dave, you want
to jam a little?

20:14.314 --> 20:15.448
- Yeah.
