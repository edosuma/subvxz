WEBVTT

00:06.399 --> 00:07.564
The price is firm unless, of course,

00:07.650 --> 00:09.617
you make an all-cash offer.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:30.645 --> 00:31.445
I want it.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.230
Really, you don't have to decide today.

00:33.315 --> 00:35.732
No, we just seen 20 apartments, man. Look!

00:35.784 --> 00:38.068
Will you let her tell you
how much they're asking first?

00:38.153 --> 00:40.704
I can afford it, can I not?

00:40.739 --> 00:44.491
Yes, you can, my cousin. Yes, you can.

01:07.386 --> 01:09.553
The lamp goes in a yard sale pile.

01:09.588 --> 01:11.421
The cheetah goes to "take to Atlanta" pile.

01:11.473 --> 01:13.674
- Yes, ma'am.
- Wait, I'm watching that.

01:13.759 --> 01:15.509
No, no, TV goes last.

01:15.594 --> 01:17.311
I got an important viewing coming up.

01:17.396 --> 01:19.563
The reason why I'm moving
to Atlanta is coming up.

01:19.598 --> 01:23.100
Patience, virtue. And
your current instructions.

01:23.152 --> 01:24.401
Thank you.

01:24.436 --> 01:27.604
- We're moments away...
- Oh, here we go.

01:27.656 --> 01:29.489
That's my boy that's moving me to Atlanta.

01:29.735 --> 01:31.735
Calloway, the Boston
native who entered the pros

01:31.770 --> 01:34.437
as an undrafted free agent, has only earned

01:34.490 --> 01:36.650
the league minimum since
his debut in Memphis.

01:36.651 --> 01:39.276
- That was then. Tell me about now.
- Calloway exploded in Memphis,

01:39.361 --> 01:41.278
landing him a massive new deal in Atlanta.

01:41.330 --> 01:43.163
And he deserves every massive penny.

01:43.248 --> 01:46.616
Pundits believe Calloway makes
Atlanta an instant contender.

01:46.668 --> 01:48.502
That's right. Pundits know their shit.

01:48.587 --> 01:50.287
Ladies and gentlemen, Cam Calloway.

01:52.457 --> 01:55.792
Yes. Yes, thank you.

01:58.597 --> 02:00.964
I just want to thank Mr. and Mrs. Flaherty

02:01.049 --> 02:02.716
for bringing me to Atlanta.

02:06.305 --> 02:08.805
You know, I stand here a lucky guy,

02:08.857 --> 02:11.808
which is unusual for a
man with my background.

02:11.894 --> 02:15.445
Growing up, my family often wondered

02:15.480 --> 02:18.982
how we would eat, where we would sleep.

02:19.067 --> 02:22.319
Dreams were basically don't get shot.

02:22.404 --> 02:25.288
And drug dealing

02:25.324 --> 02:28.241
wasn't a road to ruin,

02:28.327 --> 02:32.412
but a reasonable way out
of this gang-infested place

02:32.497 --> 02:34.831
where no kid should have to come of age.

02:34.917 --> 02:36.299
I wrote that.

02:36.335 --> 02:37.918
- No wonder it sounds written.
- Fuck you.

02:38.003 --> 02:41.004
No, but there's four people
who forced me to believe

02:41.056 --> 02:45.008
that I and they were
worthy of a big-time dream.

02:45.060 --> 02:46.676
Like, a good thing.

02:46.762 --> 02:49.095
Those four people that
believed in me are my family.

02:53.769 --> 02:58.154
So, Ma, I know you watching from home.

02:58.190 --> 03:00.190
I just got one thing to say.

03:00.242 --> 03:02.742
Thank you for not aborting me.

03:05.697 --> 03:07.831
That would have sucked.

03:07.866 --> 03:10.533
Not just for me, for y'all.

03:11.837 --> 03:13.086
I love you, Ma.

03:15.257 --> 03:19.542
Mary Charles, my sister, my idol.

03:19.628 --> 03:22.712
Thank you for mercilessly hacking me

03:22.764 --> 03:24.598
in our every game of one-on-one.

03:24.683 --> 03:28.268
I'm the shooter I am now
because driving on you

03:28.353 --> 03:32.055
paralyzed the young me. Still does.

03:32.140 --> 03:33.890
Uncle Julius.

03:33.976 --> 03:37.394
Thank you for teaching me
the values of uncommon sense.

03:37.446 --> 03:40.563
You know, I'm the one that
stopped that abortion, too,

03:40.616 --> 03:43.950
that your momma was gonna have.

03:44.036 --> 03:46.069
Reggie Vaughn.

03:46.154 --> 03:48.288
My cousin.

03:48.373 --> 03:50.740
Dude, you took that word cousin

03:50.826 --> 03:53.376
and just blew it up

03:53.412 --> 03:57.080
to include all these
other amazing human words

03:57.165 --> 03:59.716
like advocate,

03:59.751 --> 04:01.668
cornerman,

04:01.753 --> 04:03.553
confidant,

04:03.588 --> 04:05.588
loyalist.

04:08.510 --> 04:10.310
Yo, you my best friend, man.

04:12.014 --> 04:13.763
All I got is because of you.

04:16.567 --> 04:18.485
He's gonna blubber like
a little bitch. Watch.

04:18.570 --> 04:21.021
So thank you, Atlanta.

04:21.106 --> 04:23.156
Yo, we here now, baby. We home.

04:32.668 --> 04:36.036
- Well said, Cam.
- Thank you, Mrs. Flaherty.

04:36.121 --> 04:37.837
My plane's waiting to take you to LA.

04:37.923 --> 04:39.923
Try not to cry on it, okay?

04:39.958 --> 04:42.425
Calloway's initiation
to the ranks of the elite

04:42.461 --> 04:44.761
continues with a trip
on Jimmy Flaherty's jet

04:44.796 --> 04:47.130
to Los Angeles for the ESPYs tonight.

04:47.182 --> 04:49.099
Then back to what will be his new home

04:49.134 --> 04:50.600
for some time, Atlanta.

04:50.635 --> 04:53.386
Busy. Fuck off.

04:53.472 --> 04:56.189
Yo, Marcus, it's Dirty.
How about you open the door,

04:56.274 --> 04:58.024
I'll fuck you up and then I'll fuck off?

04:58.110 --> 05:00.143
No, I'm good. Thanks.

05:05.690 --> 05:07.150
- That was supposed to blow the lock off,
- Come here.

05:07.202 --> 05:09.285
but it's a resilient motherfucker.

05:09.321 --> 05:10.987
So open the door.

05:11.073 --> 05:12.739
That gunshot got me concerned.

05:12.824 --> 05:14.407
Yo, if I wanted to shoot you,

05:14.493 --> 05:16.793
I'd go shoot your super, steal his keys.

05:16.828 --> 05:19.329
open your door, then shoot you.

05:19.381 --> 05:21.164
It's too much effort.

05:21.249 --> 05:23.800
Dealer Joe wants us to talk face-to-face.

05:23.835 --> 05:25.885
Just be cool.

05:25.971 --> 05:27.721
All right?

05:31.143 --> 05:32.342
This ain't cool!

05:32.394 --> 05:33.927
We literally just talked about...

05:39.401 --> 05:42.402
Look, you owe us 2,000 American dollars.

05:42.487 --> 05:43.686
Find them, steal them,

05:43.772 --> 05:45.605
or borrow them from somebody not named Joe.

05:45.690 --> 05:48.024
Do one of the three
quick, or you're gonna be

05:48.110 --> 05:50.076
making it up to us in ways you don't wanna.

05:50.162 --> 05:52.612
Of course, I'll feel like leaning in

05:52.697 --> 05:56.166
and saying something all
boss like, "Understand?"

05:56.201 --> 05:58.752
But I know you do.

05:58.837 --> 06:00.420
So I won't.

06:07.879 --> 06:10.880
Hey, Ma, just checking in to
see how the packing is going.

06:10.932 --> 06:13.183
Got my ESPY.

06:13.218 --> 06:15.385
Land in Atlanta around 4:00.

06:15.470 --> 06:18.354
Can't wait to have you with me.

06:18.390 --> 06:20.857
Did you just call your mother?

06:20.892 --> 06:22.776
Uh, yeah.

06:22.861 --> 06:25.528
She's having her first yard sale.

06:25.564 --> 06:27.397
Does the way I fuck remind you of your mom?

06:27.449 --> 06:28.898
Because that would really bum me out.

06:28.950 --> 06:30.150
No. No, no, no.

06:30.235 --> 06:32.952
You're doing fine.

06:33.038 --> 06:36.039
So, you're a multimillionaire

06:36.074 --> 06:37.657
and your mom still has yard sales?

06:37.742 --> 06:39.876
She never had a yard till this year.

06:39.911 --> 06:41.578
- Oh.
- Yeah.

06:45.083 --> 06:46.633
Ah. Hey, baby.

06:46.718 --> 06:49.719
Hurry back home. I am not
made for cleaning pools

06:49.754 --> 06:52.172
and I may not be made for
life in Atlanta at all.

06:52.257 --> 06:54.340
You got the palace of your dreams.

06:54.426 --> 06:56.426
My dreams never involved Atlanta.

06:56.478 --> 06:59.896
A city our ancestors came to
in chains and lived like mules.

06:59.931 --> 07:01.397
And plus, it's hot as shit, Reggie.

07:01.433 --> 07:03.349
I can't wait to get
home and go down on you.

07:03.435 --> 07:05.018
I'll still be in Atlanta.

07:05.103 --> 07:07.270
How can I get you to love Atlanta?

07:07.355 --> 07:09.105
Burn it down like Sherman did.

07:09.157 --> 07:10.690
Wait, what did Richard Sherman do now?

07:10.775 --> 07:13.109
General William Tecumseh Sherman.

07:13.195 --> 07:15.328
Civil War general. One of the good guys.

07:15.413 --> 07:17.497
Oh, the Civil War. Baby,
look, I've moved on.

07:17.582 --> 07:19.782
You should have made Cam
sign in New York or LA.

07:19.835 --> 07:22.335
Somewhere the Underground
Railroad actually went to

07:22.420 --> 07:23.620
instead of away from.

07:23.705 --> 07:27.090
- I love you.
- Get home.

07:27.125 --> 07:31.511
Hello, everybody. My
name is Cassie Calloway.

07:31.596 --> 07:33.463
I know y'all remember me from this hood.

07:33.515 --> 07:35.048
Hey. Hey, how you doing?

07:35.133 --> 07:37.100
My son Cam Calloway

07:37.135 --> 07:39.802
would like for me to give
you these things on the truck.

07:39.855 --> 07:42.472
I was gonna have a yard
sale, but you know what?

07:42.524 --> 07:44.774
It's better to give than receive, right?

07:44.809 --> 07:47.227
All right. So I want
y'all to enjoy this stuff.

07:47.312 --> 07:49.445
- Help me down here. Thank you.
- Watch your step.

07:49.481 --> 07:51.698
We ain't gonna be but 15 minutes, okay?

07:52.984 --> 07:55.368
Hey, y'all got anything good?

07:55.453 --> 07:57.370
Ghetto "Storage Wars" ain't my thing, mijo.

07:57.455 --> 07:59.539
You need to watch what you calling ghetto.

07:59.624 --> 08:02.325
And who you calling mijo? I
ain't no little boy, homie.

08:03.662 --> 08:05.128
Got a mini trampoline for you.

08:07.716 --> 08:09.499
Say thank you, mija.

08:11.136 --> 08:13.636
What is going on?

08:13.672 --> 08:17.757
Jesus, you try to do something
nice. It's ridiculous.

08:19.344 --> 08:22.178
Forget y'all!

08:36.828 --> 08:38.410
Hey, did you wire that money to Aunt Mim?

08:38.496 --> 08:40.246
She needs another surgery.

08:40.332 --> 08:42.749
She needs to quit relying on lap
bands and buy some mouth bands.

08:44.786 --> 08:47.921
Hey, I decided, man.
I'm going Ashton Martin.

08:48.006 --> 08:51.040
I will look so good driving this
when you're playing road games.

08:51.092 --> 08:53.259
Especially when I throw
them new rims on it.

08:53.345 --> 08:55.628
Oh, no. You're Cam Calloway.

08:55.714 --> 08:57.130
You don't need to prove how rich you are

08:57.215 --> 08:59.515
by making expensive
shit seem more expensive.

08:59.551 --> 09:01.884
Look, you don't put
aftermarket stones in a Rolex

09:01.970 --> 09:03.353
and you don't rim up an Aston.

09:03.388 --> 09:04.804
Rims are not a part of the plan.

09:04.889 --> 09:07.941
I'm amending the plan to
include rims for my Ashton.

09:08.026 --> 09:09.892
It's Aston. It's not "Ashton."

09:09.978 --> 09:11.611
Why you got to be like that?

09:11.696 --> 09:13.730
This is my job, all right? This is my role.

09:13.815 --> 09:15.398
You don't like me in
this role, I got a wife.

09:15.450 --> 09:16.866
A wife that's ready to start a family.

09:16.901 --> 09:18.785
And right now, I could
actually be on my wife,

09:18.870 --> 09:20.737
but instead, I'm on a private jet with you.

09:20.822 --> 09:24.073
And do you know what?
Because we followed the plan.

09:24.309 --> 09:25.975
Why do I got to hide from wanting

09:26.060 --> 09:27.610
an Aston since I was a kid?

09:27.695 --> 09:29.645
Motherfucker, you didn't even
know what a Big Wheel was.

09:29.831 --> 09:31.147
Rims are like Big Wheels.

09:31.232 --> 09:32.949
They're toys for children, not men.

09:33.034 --> 09:35.067
What is the point of
forgetting all that you wanted

09:35.120 --> 09:37.570
when you first wanted it now
that you can finally afford it?

09:37.622 --> 09:39.872
We're just recalibrating.
We're not forgetting, okay?

09:39.908 --> 09:41.624
We're progressing. We're evolving.

09:41.709 --> 09:43.075
We're still gonna save money, man.

09:43.128 --> 09:44.744
The investments, the stuff, man.

09:44.796 --> 09:46.245
You set up this whole plan.

09:46.297 --> 09:47.547
At least you said you set up the plan.

09:47.582 --> 09:48.748
I just trusted you set this shit up.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.550
Gargle my ball bag, asshole.

09:50.585 --> 09:52.251
Wow, yeah, very evolving.

09:52.337 --> 09:54.887
Get your rims. And get your
big iced-out Jesus piece.

09:54.956 --> 09:56.589
- Johnny Dang is waiting.
- You know, I will.

09:56.641 --> 09:58.891
- Spend your money, Hammer.
- Hey, I'm on it.

09:58.927 --> 10:00.893
- You ain't got to tell me.
- Do it, boy. I'm gonna be on my wife.

10:00.929 --> 10:02.929
- You go ahead and be on your wife.
- Absolutely.

10:03.014 --> 10:05.932
When "30 For 30" calls, I will
gladly grant them an interview.

10:05.984 --> 10:08.067
Get the fuck off my plane, then.

10:08.102 --> 10:10.520
It's not your fucking plane.
It's Jimmy Flaherty's plane.

10:10.605 --> 10:14.190
Yo! Yo! Shut the fuck up!

10:14.275 --> 10:16.108
Calm down!

10:16.194 --> 10:19.579
You ain't the Fresh Prince
and you ain't Carlton.

10:19.614 --> 10:22.582
Yes, he is.

10:52.397 --> 10:54.480
Snacks?

10:54.566 --> 10:56.399
Oh, I didn't know Jimmy Flaherty

10:56.484 --> 10:58.150
liked Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

10:58.203 --> 11:00.152
Well, actually, he doesn't,
but he knows that you do.

11:00.238 --> 11:03.706
Oh, okay. This ain't no $15
bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos?

11:03.791 --> 11:05.458
- No, sir.
- These are free?

11:05.493 --> 11:07.627
Yes, sir. These are
courtesy of Mr. Flaherty.

11:07.662 --> 11:09.128
I don't want my nephew to get billed

11:09.163 --> 11:10.463
for no rip-off price later.

11:10.498 --> 11:12.248
- Not at all, sir.
- Okay, well...

11:12.333 --> 11:14.000
two of 'em.

11:14.302 --> 11:15.501
Can I get you anything?

11:15.586 --> 11:17.419
How about a peek at your panties?

11:17.472 --> 11:19.922
We'll be landing shortly.

11:24.562 --> 11:28.013
Look, don't be trolling up here.

11:28.099 --> 11:30.099
She works for Jimmy Flaherty.

11:30.151 --> 11:32.485
We got an appearance to keep up.

11:32.570 --> 11:34.987
Why don't you do your thing
and let me do my thing?

11:35.072 --> 11:37.490
Yeah, doing my thing is flying private now.

11:37.575 --> 11:39.859
Don't mess that up.

11:45.533 --> 11:46.916
This is Reggie.

11:46.951 --> 11:48.868
This is Marcus Pierce
from the neighborhood.

11:48.953 --> 11:52.288
- Long time.
- Not that long, fucky.

11:52.453 --> 11:54.086
How can I help you, fucky?

11:54.171 --> 11:56.205
Hey, smug fucky, don't get abrupt.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.790
Remember where you came from.

11:57.875 --> 11:59.708
Don't tell me what to forget or remember.

11:59.794 --> 12:01.844
Look, I got no access to Celtics tickets.

12:01.879 --> 12:04.296
I don't want Celtics
tickets. They unwatchable.

12:04.382 --> 12:06.599
I got some shit that
your cousin might like.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.217
His old days stuff. Souvenirs.

12:08.302 --> 12:10.135
Cool. I'll text you an address.

12:10.221 --> 12:12.221
It'll be about 3K to ship.

12:12.306 --> 12:15.057
How about I ship you my
foot to put up your ass?

12:15.109 --> 12:18.277
It's personal stuff. I
got jerseys, memorabilia.

12:18.362 --> 12:21.730
Cam's mom gave away a bunch of
stuff that she shouldn't have.

12:21.782 --> 12:25.200
Now it's mine. And for
3K it could be yours.

12:25.236 --> 12:27.569
Believe me, Cam wants what I got.

12:27.622 --> 12:30.239
HPV? No, thanks. If
you're gonna shake me down,

12:30.291 --> 12:33.742
you got to shake a little
harder than that, fucky.

12:36.747 --> 12:39.748
And a truck will be delivered tomorrow.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.301
Yes. Well, you did right by me.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.470
All right, Coach.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.422
Yeah, text me a photo.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.807
Okay. All love to Mrs. Healey.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.393
All right. Peace.

12:52.930 --> 12:54.930
I just bought Coach Healey a truck.

12:55.016 --> 12:56.732
You get a good price?

12:56.767 --> 12:59.101
I don't care. Look, I called the dealer.

12:59.186 --> 13:01.437
I said give me the best truck
y'all got for a 50-year-old man

13:01.489 --> 13:02.905
and I put it on my credit card.

13:02.940 --> 13:05.607
Mmm. That's top-notch negotiating, Cousin.

13:05.660 --> 13:08.193
No more dad talk. No more dad talk.

13:08.279 --> 13:10.663
Hey, I'm being a friend. I'm
being a cousin. A manager.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.115
Look, you got big new money now, Cam.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.285
It's smart, it's fair
to lock down new rules

13:16.370 --> 13:18.754
so the money lasts, man.
You know, make a budget.

13:18.789 --> 13:20.706
Monitor what we give
away and what we invest.

13:20.791 --> 13:23.092
- I want to spend some.
- You're spending plenty.

13:23.127 --> 13:25.094
You got apartments. You got Astons.

13:25.129 --> 13:26.762
You got new trucks for high school coaches.

13:26.797 --> 13:29.264
You got fat fuck surgeries
for a fat fuck aunt.

13:29.300 --> 13:32.851
She's fat. Maybe she
is just meant to be fat.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.304
Don't judge, just accept.

13:36.974 --> 13:38.724
I'm rimming up the Aston.

13:38.809 --> 13:41.060
- I know you are.
- All right.

13:41.145 --> 13:42.978
But I'm telling you,
there are so many people

13:43.064 --> 13:44.480
ready to suckle at your teat.

13:44.565 --> 13:47.282
So many fuckies just
crawling out from everywhere.

13:47.318 --> 13:49.618
People you know, people
you forgot you knew,

13:49.653 --> 13:51.370
all ready to spend your money.

13:51.545 --> 13:54.546
And we got to be careful.
We got to be smart.

13:54.582 --> 13:57.049
We help until we can't.

13:57.084 --> 13:58.801
We're lucky.

13:58.886 --> 14:00.469
No, we made our own luck.

14:00.554 --> 14:03.388
Not always. It's like
we fell from the Titanic

14:03.424 --> 14:06.391
and landed in a lifeboat and survived.

14:06.427 --> 14:08.594
And yet, I mean, I feel...

14:08.679 --> 14:10.596
shit, what's the word?

14:10.681 --> 14:13.599
- Happy?
- Hell, no. The opposite.

14:13.651 --> 14:17.936
Man, I feel guilty that I'm surviving

14:18.022 --> 14:20.439
and there's people that I can still help

14:20.491 --> 14:22.074
that are back home drowning.

14:22.109 --> 14:23.942
It is not your fault that
the world is the way it is

14:23.994 --> 14:25.777
or that where we left ain't paradise.

14:25.863 --> 14:27.779
Schindler had his list, man.

14:27.865 --> 14:29.832
It was people he knew. It
was people he didn't know.

14:29.917 --> 14:31.950
"Schindler's List"? "Schindler's"...

14:32.036 --> 14:33.168
what, did you spend the day

14:33.254 --> 14:34.620
watching a bunch of depressing movies?

14:34.672 --> 14:36.672
Shit, let's watch "Amistad" next.

14:36.757 --> 14:38.457
"Sounder." "Roots."

14:38.509 --> 14:40.342
We can watch the whole box collection, man.

14:40.427 --> 14:41.844
Let's multiply the laughs.

14:41.929 --> 14:43.295
I identify with Schindler, all right?

14:43.380 --> 14:45.631
- Helping people.
- Fuck "Schindler's List."

14:45.716 --> 14:46.965
Fuck "Schindler's List"?

14:47.051 --> 14:48.717
Fuck your version of "Schindler's List"

14:48.802 --> 14:50.302
because it does not apply.

14:50.387 --> 14:52.971
Schindler was trying to
save people from Hitler.

14:53.023 --> 14:54.773
Some tweak in Dorchester does

14:54.808 --> 14:56.108
not deserve a spot on your generosity list

14:56.143 --> 14:58.610
just because he grew up two doors down.

14:58.646 --> 15:01.313
I'm not so sure about that, Reg.

15:01.398 --> 15:03.365
And the Titanic? Really?

15:03.450 --> 15:05.868
The Titanic was a boat for
rich white people. Fuck 'em.

15:05.953 --> 15:07.369
Fuck 'em. They could all freeze

15:07.454 --> 15:09.404
the fuck to death and
drown. I could give a shit.

15:09.490 --> 15:11.823
Now, if they had any good
sense to invite a black man

15:11.876 --> 15:12.991
down to those docks in England,

15:13.043 --> 15:14.293
that black man would have told them

15:14.328 --> 15:16.295
what getting on a boat to America means.

15:16.330 --> 15:17.963
Nothing good.

15:17.998 --> 15:19.831
Giving a shit makes us unique.

15:19.917 --> 15:21.333
But you give too much.

15:21.418 --> 15:23.168
And then you just become a cautionary tale.

15:23.220 --> 15:24.753
One that will not be told about you

15:24.838 --> 15:26.255
as long as I'm in your life.

15:26.340 --> 15:29.424
We will not be the same sad story, dude.

15:29.510 --> 15:31.343
You're the Titanic, baby.

15:31.428 --> 15:34.179
Yes, you are the Titanic.

15:34.265 --> 15:35.731
A massive talent

15:35.816 --> 15:39.184
with a bunch of self-serving
icebergs just lying in wait,

15:39.236 --> 15:41.570
ready to crash into you and sink you.

15:41.655 --> 15:46.074
Man, fuck. We talking about the
Titanic and "Schindler's List"?

15:46.160 --> 15:47.576
We need some more comedies.

15:47.661 --> 15:49.578
I don't know, fucking "SpongeBob."

15:49.663 --> 15:51.830
Fucking "Martin" reruns. Just...

15:51.865 --> 15:54.249
Yo, we good, man?

15:54.335 --> 15:56.702
- Huh?
- Yeah.

16:00.591 --> 16:03.041
Little man. Look.

16:03.127 --> 16:05.210
Posted Cam's stuff up online.

16:05.296 --> 16:08.931
We gonna sell it, pay our debts.

16:09.016 --> 16:11.383
Got a lot of cool movies in here.

16:13.437 --> 16:15.687
Calloway's bootleg everything.

16:15.723 --> 16:18.724
Got "Lion King," "Home
Alone," "Pulp Fiction."

16:18.809 --> 16:21.310
All right, let's do a "Lion King," okay?

16:26.984 --> 16:28.617
All right, we gonna watch "Lion King."

16:28.702 --> 16:30.068
Watch the movie with Daddy?

16:30.120 --> 16:31.737
We gonna get expelled
for taking this camera.

16:31.789 --> 16:35.123
This thing is ancient, bro.

16:35.209 --> 16:38.910
Yo, I don't give a fuck.

16:38.963 --> 16:41.997
I am Cam Calloway. I'm
gonna take over the world.

16:42.082 --> 16:44.082
And the first thing I'm gonna do

16:44.134 --> 16:46.585
is teach these motherfucking Chinese

16:46.637 --> 16:47.886
how to cook Chinese food.

16:47.921 --> 16:49.638
This stuff is shat.

16:49.723 --> 16:52.557
I mean, shit. Fuck them Chinks.

16:52.593 --> 16:55.394
Yo, that sounds like a rap.

16:55.429 --> 16:57.646
Give me a beat. Give me a beat. I got this.

16:59.933 --> 17:02.567
Reggie's been all over me,

17:02.603 --> 17:05.436
but I still think I should
set up a charitable foundation.

17:05.521 --> 17:07.105
Chuck, you could run that for me.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.407
- Sure, I'll run that shit.
- In the ground.

17:09.443 --> 17:11.777
Probably.

17:11.862 --> 17:14.529
Bottom line, got to give back.

17:14.615 --> 17:16.080
Fuck this give-back shit.

17:16.116 --> 17:18.867
You want to give, then give. That's fine.

17:18.952 --> 17:20.535
But what you got you earned.

17:20.621 --> 17:22.454
You ain't got to give that back.

17:22.539 --> 17:25.507
Uncle J is feeling that weed.

17:25.592 --> 17:28.260
This is common sense buried deep.

17:28.295 --> 17:30.462
Yeah, the weed just dug it up.

17:38.055 --> 17:40.222
"Cam Calloway's treasure trove"?

17:40.387 --> 17:44.139
Best Vegas buffet, Treasure Island.

17:44.224 --> 17:46.775
Best Vegas pussy, Circus Circus.

17:46.860 --> 17:49.811
Yeah, another piece of
information I cannot use.

17:49.897 --> 17:51.279
This is somebody claiming

17:51.365 --> 17:52.814
to have some of your
old jerseys and trophies.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.734
- He's selling them online.
- What?

17:55.786 --> 17:58.904
This is my shit. Yo, how'd he get my shit?

17:58.989 --> 18:01.239
Uncle Julius, you selling my shit?

18:01.325 --> 18:02.407
No.

18:02.459 --> 18:03.825
I'm on it.

18:05.412 --> 18:07.996
So let this be a lesson to everyone.

18:08.081 --> 18:10.048
Everything you say, everything you write,

18:10.083 --> 18:12.584
everything is in play
when you become famous.

18:12.636 --> 18:15.053
Atlanta owner Jimmy
Flaherty, he can't be happy.

18:15.088 --> 18:18.590
Yeah, this is earth-shattering
that a 14-year-old

18:18.675 --> 18:20.142
has an active imagination?

18:20.227 --> 18:22.010
Tell it to little Kiomi Holloran

18:22.095 --> 18:24.062
about what he wanted to
do down at the Hatch Shell.

18:24.097 --> 18:27.232
So everything you did at 14 was saintly?

18:27.267 --> 18:29.935
I was a good Catholic boy.

18:30.587 --> 18:33.438
Be nice.

18:55.295 --> 18:57.179
Yo, call Ma. She thinks you're mad.

18:57.264 --> 18:58.930
I am mad. I want my shit back.

18:58.966 --> 19:00.515
You are the one who
told her to give it away

19:00.601 --> 19:02.184
instead of having a yard sale.

19:02.269 --> 19:04.352
Her being in that neighborhood
is your fault, you know.

19:04.438 --> 19:06.938
Hey, real quick. I wondered
if I could get some cash

19:06.974 --> 19:09.140
to take Flaherty's flight
attendant out to dinner.

19:09.226 --> 19:10.475
I thought she was straight.

19:10.561 --> 19:11.810
No girl sends you that many smiley faces

19:11.862 --> 19:14.813
unless she wants you sitting on hers.

19:14.865 --> 19:16.815
Reggie thinks we need a budget.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.283
Like to monitor the in and out, you know?

19:18.398 --> 19:21.566
Reg should monitor his own business.

19:21.618 --> 19:24.035
His business is protecting
and transitioning us

19:24.071 --> 19:26.037
towards new ground rules of accountability.

19:26.073 --> 19:28.239
Shut up and give me some money.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.408
We just want to make sure you

19:30.460 --> 19:32.127
and Uncle Julius and
Mom are on a set salary.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.296
Like, I want to be a brother
to you, not an enabler.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.964
Do you know what I'm saying?

19:36.049 --> 19:37.799
I know there are sounds
coming out of your mouth

19:37.884 --> 19:39.501
and I know the look on your
face when you're saying it,

19:39.586 --> 19:42.220
but I don't know when you
decided I was being enabled.

19:42.255 --> 19:44.389
No, I'm just saying, like,

19:44.424 --> 19:46.224
we need to actually find a specific job.

19:46.259 --> 19:48.343
I thought I was gonna be in charge

19:48.428 --> 19:49.761
of your bullshit made-up charity.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.012
You asked me to move here

19:51.098 --> 19:53.148
after you asked me to move to Memphis.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.266
And now that I've moved
to Shitlanta for you,

19:55.352 --> 19:58.069
you want to keep a tally
of what the fuck I'm doing?

19:58.105 --> 20:00.322
No, it's not a problem. I get it.

20:00.407 --> 20:03.992
But from now on, I'm gonna
bill you for prior services.

20:05.278 --> 20:06.328
Like what?

20:06.413 --> 20:08.579
Like teaching you how to walk.

20:08.632 --> 20:12.417
How to talk. Eat. Shit
somewhere other than your pants.

20:12.452 --> 20:14.953
Teaching you how to read and tell time.

20:15.038 --> 20:17.122
- You know, like a good sister does.
- Calm down.

20:17.207 --> 20:20.425
No, I'm gonna back-bill
you for every ass I kicked

20:20.460 --> 20:23.378
defending your little pussy ass
every day you went to school.

20:23.463 --> 20:25.230
You don't even hear what I'm saying.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.098
You are not remembering
all there is to remember.

20:27.134 --> 20:30.719
Like that night I saved
you from Mr. Chambers

20:30.804 --> 20:33.138
going all Sandusky on you.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.306
I'm talking about a budget.

20:35.359 --> 20:37.708
I walked in in the nick of time

20:37.714 --> 20:39.561
and I tackled that fuck good.

20:39.726 --> 20:44.562
Then a cop gave us a coupon
to go to Baskin-Robbins

20:44.648 --> 20:48.450
and you ordered... you ordered Berry Blast.

20:48.535 --> 20:51.653
And I got vanilla with sprinkles.

20:53.490 --> 20:55.990
You know what?

20:56.076 --> 20:59.043
Cut a check. We'll be square.

21:00.413 --> 21:01.996
Fuck.

21:12.676 --> 21:13.625
Staying trim.

21:13.710 --> 21:15.611
I quit eating cereal.

21:16.047 --> 21:17.413
How much is this gonna take?

21:17.465 --> 21:20.165
What do you think? Getting
a lot of bids online.

21:20.251 --> 21:21.583
I was talking to Joe.

21:21.636 --> 21:23.752
Yeah, I can still hear you over here.

21:26.307 --> 21:28.974
I can't talk right now, Missy.

21:29.060 --> 21:31.593
Three club chairs arrived. Why?

21:31.679 --> 21:32.811
It's for my man cave.

21:32.897 --> 21:34.813
Caves are where bears sleep,

21:34.899 --> 21:36.432
bats shit, and men rape women.

21:36.517 --> 21:38.233
Not if they got nice club chairs.

21:38.269 --> 21:41.103
I'm returning the chairs. Enjoy Boston.

21:41.188 --> 21:42.771
Missy. Missy.

21:42.823 --> 21:44.773
Yo, man cave, off the phone, man.

21:44.859 --> 21:47.576
Where's the box of Cam's
shit? I want it all.

21:47.611 --> 21:49.528
Five grand, that's my final offer.

21:49.613 --> 21:52.081
- You don't start with final offer.
- I just did.

21:52.116 --> 21:54.750
Yo, you ain't getting
that tape for less than 50.

21:54.785 --> 21:57.536
What tape?

21:57.621 --> 21:59.204
Fucky don't know about the tape?

21:59.290 --> 22:01.840
I wanted to see his reaction up close.

22:01.926 --> 22:05.127
Think he the shit 'cause his
cousin Cam is a baller now.

22:05.179 --> 22:08.847
Think he the baller. Think he king rat.

22:09.967 --> 22:12.518
Play the shit.

22:20.478 --> 22:21.727
Yo.

22:21.812 --> 22:24.229
So you remember the
video camera that we stole

22:24.315 --> 22:26.532
when we were in junior high school?

22:26.617 --> 22:29.485
* Fuck them Chinks, fuck them Chinks *

22:29.537 --> 22:32.154
* Fuck them Chinks, yeah,
their fucking food stinks *

22:32.239 --> 22:34.823
* Fuck them Chinks, fuck them Chinks *

22:34.909 --> 22:38.210
* Yo, I'm gonna say it again,
their fucking food stinks. *

22:38.295 --> 22:40.129
That song was your idea.

22:40.164 --> 22:41.880
Hey, I was high. And it don't matter.

22:41.966 --> 22:43.165
Hoop stars can't call people Chinks.

22:43.250 --> 22:45.217
- It's racist.
- We were kids.

22:45.302 --> 22:47.169
Kids ain't allowed to be
racist anymore either, Cam.

22:47.254 --> 22:48.887
World's fucked, but that's the way it is.

22:48.973 --> 22:51.423
Dude, my owner's wife is a Chink.

22:51.509 --> 22:53.809
No, she's not. She's Chinese, okay?

22:53.844 --> 22:55.010
Look, there's no more Chinks.

22:55.062 --> 22:56.178
There's no more saying the word Chinks.

22:56.263 --> 22:58.013
No more saying the word Chinks.

22:58.099 --> 23:00.482
It's just you getting on a
plane with a bag of fucking cash

23:00.518 --> 23:02.017
from the safe to pay these fuckies off.

23:02.103 --> 23:03.435
Hey, man, let's just let the tape out.

23:03.521 --> 23:04.937
We'll tell people we was just playing.

23:05.022 --> 23:07.356
A billion Chinese won't
see it that way, Cam.

23:07.441 --> 23:08.357
This tape gets out, you
know what you're gonna

23:08.442 --> 23:09.908
be to a billion Chinese?

23:09.994 --> 23:11.493
A young black Donald Sterling.

23:11.529 --> 23:13.495
Fuck!

23:13.531 --> 23:15.531
If you don't want to be
known as a young black

23:15.616 --> 23:18.283
Chinese-hating Donald Sterling,
get your ass to Boston.

23:18.369 --> 23:20.285
I got a car picking you up, okay?

23:20.371 --> 23:21.587
Flaherty is letting us use his jet.

23:21.672 --> 23:23.539
I lied. I told him Aunt Mim was sick.

23:23.591 --> 23:25.791
- Aunt Mim is sick?
- No. I mean, yes.

23:25.876 --> 23:28.544
She's 400 pounds. She's in
a constant state of sickness.

23:28.629 --> 23:30.379
Get to the airport.

23:32.383 --> 23:34.550
* Cool just like I run this city *

23:34.635 --> 23:37.686
* This all fried chicken
is so damn shitty. *

23:37.721 --> 23:41.440
Still going by Dealer Joe,
huh? It's not very low profile.

23:41.525 --> 23:43.892
I don't like the way you
called this place gang-infested.

23:43.978 --> 23:45.444
I come here out of respect.

23:45.529 --> 23:47.196
No, you here 'cause you're scared

23:47.231 --> 23:49.114
we're gonna show the world the real you.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.233
Not the fake you. Not the TV you.

23:51.285 --> 23:53.152
No, I'm here because my
mom has a generous side,

23:53.237 --> 23:54.820
so fuck you for taking advantage.

23:54.905 --> 23:55.954
Who took advantage of who?

23:56.040 --> 23:57.623
Oh, here we go.

23:57.708 --> 23:59.741
Yeah, here we go down memory lane.

23:59.794 --> 24:02.411
Y'all brought me to that
card game and I trusted you.

24:02.496 --> 24:05.164
But I was there as the
mark, not the friend.

24:05.249 --> 24:07.249
I put up the cash that
I was saving for years

24:07.334 --> 24:09.168
for Robert Parish's basketball camp

24:09.253 --> 24:10.836
and y'all rolled me good.

24:10.921 --> 24:12.254
Gambling is gambling.

24:12.306 --> 24:14.423
And friends ain't friends.

24:14.475 --> 24:17.059
Not when your friend pulled a
ton of cash out of his pocket

24:17.094 --> 24:19.428
and he ain't never heard of a stacked deck.

24:19.480 --> 24:22.231
Marcus, if it makes you feel any better,

24:22.266 --> 24:24.099
we were rolling you because Tammy Laplante

24:24.151 --> 24:25.267
said she would strip for us

24:25.352 --> 24:27.269
if we paid her. We paid her.

24:27.321 --> 24:28.737
And then her brother
beat the shit out of us.

24:28.772 --> 24:31.073
Yo, before she even got her shirt off.

24:31.108 --> 24:34.076
He rolled us for what
we was rolling you for.

24:34.111 --> 24:36.945
Yeah? I feel so much better now.

24:37.031 --> 24:39.281
Yo, Tammy Laplante was fine.

24:39.333 --> 24:41.450
Still fine. And all classy now.

24:41.502 --> 24:43.702
You know she work at T.J.
Maxx up in Quincy, right?

24:43.787 --> 24:45.454
Yo, they got some good shit over there.

24:45.539 --> 24:48.423
Marcus, I was an idiot much of my life.

24:48.459 --> 24:50.926
I mean, you got evidence of that and more.

24:50.961 --> 24:52.711
I'm sorry. You deserved better.

24:56.967 --> 24:59.384
Hey, man, fuck Robert Parish.

24:59.470 --> 25:01.854
He should have let all of
us go to his camp for free.

25:01.939 --> 25:04.106
I mean, I could shoot
threes like Ray Allen.

25:04.141 --> 25:06.558
- I could have went to Gonzaga.
- Fuck Gonzaga.

25:06.644 --> 25:09.528
- I need my money.
- All right.

25:09.613 --> 25:12.231
That's the 2K Marcus owes you plus 10.

25:12.316 --> 25:14.199
That's five for you, Dirty.

25:14.285 --> 25:16.485
Marcus... whoa, hey, hey.

25:16.537 --> 25:18.320
I put your shit on the Internet

25:18.372 --> 25:20.072
'cause I had a debt.

25:20.157 --> 25:22.241
That debt paid. I don't
need no more money from you.

25:22.326 --> 25:24.209
- Dirty, you give him a gun?
- No.

25:24.295 --> 25:28.213
I didn't make a copy
of your stupid-ass video

25:28.299 --> 25:30.299
'cause that ain't me.

25:30.334 --> 25:31.833
I ain't trying to ruin a man.

25:31.919 --> 25:33.302
Look, man, just take the money, fool.

25:33.337 --> 25:35.470
You call me fool again
and I'm gonna shoot you.

25:35.506 --> 25:37.756
I'm not gonna kill you,
but I'm gonna maim you.

25:37.841 --> 25:40.131
I'm gonna shoot you somewhere
you gonna remember me.

25:40.377 --> 25:43.211
Marcus, we do remember you.

25:43.296 --> 25:46.264
Man, we messed up back then.

25:47.634 --> 25:50.018
Shit, man, we're sorry.

25:51.388 --> 25:53.521
Truly.

26:06.486 --> 26:09.537
If I send y'all some tickets,
would you come down to Atlanta?

26:09.572 --> 26:10.872
Floor seats?

26:10.907 --> 26:14.409
Now would be a good time for y'all to go.

26:19.582 --> 26:22.383
I'll text you some dates that work.

27:02.309 --> 27:04.943
It wasn't cool what we did to Marcus.

27:04.978 --> 27:08.029
We just made up for it.

27:08.114 --> 27:10.148
This place didn't teach us

27:10.200 --> 27:11.983
a lot of good things very well, did it?

27:12.068 --> 27:14.152
It taught us to stand
still when a gun gets drawn.

27:14.204 --> 27:15.820
Wish it would have taught
us to put some diapers on

27:15.906 --> 27:17.488
when it looked like a
gun was gonna get drawn.

27:17.541 --> 27:19.157
I almost fucking shit all over myself.

27:19.242 --> 27:20.742
I would have shit myself, too,

27:20.827 --> 27:22.243
but the shit was too scared to come out.

27:24.915 --> 27:26.915
Thanks for inviting all
those fools to Atlanta.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.835
They're staying at your place. I'm serious.

27:32.422 --> 27:33.838
I need a drink.

27:33.924 --> 27:36.724
It's 2:00 A.M. Missed last call.

27:36.810 --> 27:40.645
You'd think a city as
constantly drunk as Boston

27:40.680 --> 27:42.513
would serve drinks after 2:00.

27:42.599 --> 27:43.932
Oh, shit, you know where they serve

27:44.017 --> 27:45.817
after-hours alcohol in Boston?

27:45.852 --> 27:47.435
- Nowhere.
- Not true.

27:47.520 --> 27:49.854
They pour beer after
hours in one part of town.

27:49.906 --> 27:52.190
You just got to order tea.
You got to ask for it cold.

27:52.242 --> 27:55.660
Cold tea, I forgot about that.

27:55.695 --> 27:58.279
Cold tea equals cold beer in Chinatown.

27:58.365 --> 28:01.532
- Let's go to Chinatown, cousin.
- I love them Chinks.

28:01.618 --> 28:03.251
No! No more Chinks.

28:03.336 --> 28:05.203
- I'm just playing.
- No more playing.

28:05.288 --> 28:08.206
No more joking about any ethnic group.

28:08.258 --> 28:09.874
Okay.
