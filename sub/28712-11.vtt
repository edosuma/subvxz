WEBVTT

00:00.720 --> 00:03.850
NARRATOR: Are alien visitors
coming to Earth in spacecraft?

00:05.380 --> 00:09.090
WILLIAM HENRY: These mysterious lights
appear to be intelligently directed.

00:09.210 --> 00:13.470
NARRATOR: Or could some be
coming here by other means?

00:13.590 --> 00:15.180
DAVID CHILDRESS: When we think of
encounters with extraterrestrials,

00:15.300 --> 00:18.140
it's quite possible
that they are using

00:18.260 --> 00:21.480
some interdimensional
way of traveling.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.100
NARRATOR: There are those who
believe that not all close encounters

00:25.230 --> 00:27.900
are of the physical kind...

00:28.020 --> 00:30.480
JOHN BRANDENBURG: Would we perceive
life in these parallel universes

00:30.610 --> 00:33.900
as like a ghost or a spirit?
An angel?

00:34.030 --> 00:38.370
NARRATOR: And that alien contact
often happens without our knowledge...

00:38.490 --> 00:41.120
CAROLINE CORY: It exists
beyond the visible spectrum.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.460
So the fact that
we don't see it,

00:43.580 --> 00:44.920
doesn't mean it's not there.

00:45.040 --> 00:48.290
NARRATOR:
And leaving no trace.

00:48.420 --> 00:51.170
RABBI ARIEL BAR TZADOK: Maybe we're not
really dealing with extraterrestrials

00:51.300 --> 00:55.680
from <i>outer space,
but ultra-terrestrials</i>

00:55.800 --> 00:58.890
coming from <i>parallel space.</i>

01:01.600 --> 01:03.730
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:03.850 --> 01:06.600
in the universe.

01:06.730 --> 01:09.520
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:11.070 --> 01:13.280
It demands
we question everything

01:13.400 --> 01:15.610
we have ever been taught.

01:15.740 --> 01:19.870
The evidence is all around us.

01:19.990 --> 01:23.330
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:23.450 --> 01:26.040
We are not alone.

01:26.170 --> 01:29.380
We have never <i>been alone.</i>

01:35.760 --> 01:38.430
NARRATOR:
Pisgah National Forest.

01:40.140 --> 01:42.890
Burke County, North Carolina.

01:43.020 --> 01:46.600
As darkness descends
on the Brown Mountains,

01:46.730 --> 01:50.770
strange glowing orbs materialize
on the horizon.

01:50.900 --> 01:54.530
They hover over the range
for a few seconds at a time,

01:54.650 --> 01:57.490
and then mysteriously vanish.

01:57.610 --> 02:02.240
The Brown Mountain Lights have
been observed for centuries.

02:02.370 --> 02:05.660
There are Indian accounts
as early as the 13th century.

02:05.790 --> 02:09.039
Back in the antebellum days,
some plantation owner

02:09.169 --> 02:11.250
was hunting there, disappeared.

02:11.380 --> 02:13.130
Some of the people
from his plantation,

02:13.250 --> 02:15.840
slaves we would presume,
went looking for him,

02:15.960 --> 02:19.090
<i>they disappeared;
Never explained.</i>

02:19.220 --> 02:22.350
But that night,
these lights were seen.

02:22.470 --> 02:25.720
For decades, these lights
have been talked about,

02:25.850 --> 02:27.060
studied, and no one is sure

02:27.180 --> 02:28.770
exactly what
causes these lights.

02:28.890 --> 02:30.400
There are many theories
about them,

02:30.520 --> 02:32.440
but nobody really knows
for sure.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.820
There's the very curious story

02:35.940 --> 02:38.240
of a person named Ralph Lael

02:38.360 --> 02:39.910
who claimed that
he was following

02:40.030 --> 02:42.200
the Brown Mountain Light
one night

02:42.320 --> 02:48.580
and that it led him into a
secret cave full of crystals.

02:48.710 --> 02:53.920
And a booming voice then told
him about extraterrestrials...

02:54.040 --> 02:56.260
(distorted voice)

02:56.380 --> 02:59.050
and that they had
the technology to go

02:59.170 --> 03:01.220
from one dimension to another,

03:01.340 --> 03:03.140
to appear and disappear.

03:03.260 --> 03:05.930
NARRATOR:
Extraterrestrials...

03:06.060 --> 03:09.230
Appearing and disappearing?

03:09.350 --> 03:11.770
Moving between dimensions?

03:11.900 --> 03:14.570
While it may sound
like a fanciful story,

03:14.690 --> 03:17.610
the Brown Mountain Lights have
confounded attempts

03:17.730 --> 03:20.610
at conventional explanation
for centuries.

03:20.740 --> 03:24.120
And this phenomenon,
while baffling,

03:24.240 --> 03:25.780
is not entirely unique.

03:28.200 --> 03:32.960
All over the world, there are
these anomalous lights.

03:35.420 --> 03:37.550
One of the most famous
is the Marfa Lights

03:37.670 --> 03:40.300
in West Texas.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.930
There is an area
of the Mekong River

03:44.050 --> 03:46.510
between Thailand and Laos,
where lights appear

03:46.640 --> 03:48.470
on the river every spring.

03:48.600 --> 03:51.310
And it's a well-known phenomenon
in that area.

03:51.440 --> 03:56.020
We have these lights, too, that
appear in the Bay of Bengal,

03:56.150 --> 03:58.400
and fishermen believe
that they are the lights

03:58.530 --> 04:01.570
of dead fishermen
who are sometimes guiding them

04:01.700 --> 04:03.740
to their deaths,

04:03.860 --> 04:08.160
or, conversely, they're helping
them get back to shore.

04:10.040 --> 04:14.080
These incredible occurrences
of mysterious lights

04:14.210 --> 04:16.500
that appear to be
intelligently directed

04:16.630 --> 04:19.709
as if they're alive;
And people have the sense

04:19.839 --> 04:22.470
that they're coming from
somewhere else,

04:22.590 --> 04:26.140
coming from other planets,
perhaps even other dimensions.

04:26.260 --> 04:29.890
GIORGIO TSOUKALOUS: When these
lights are seen, in my opinion,

04:30.020 --> 04:33.690
it's the result of
a technological process.

04:33.810 --> 04:36.440
Some type of technology
is involved.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.110
And that technology would have
to be extraterrestrials.

04:42.530 --> 04:45.110
NARRATOR: Could there really
be an alien connection

04:45.240 --> 04:47.870
to these seemingly
intangible orbs,

04:47.990 --> 04:51.160
often referred to
as "ghost" lights?

04:51.290 --> 04:55.330
Might they offer a brief glimpse
into other worlds,

04:55.460 --> 05:00.340
possibly within other dimensions
beyond our reality?

05:00.460 --> 05:04.340
Are they extraterrestrial,
from another planet?

05:04.470 --> 05:08.050
Were they ultra-dimensional,
from a different dimension?

05:08.180 --> 05:10.140
That all depends who you ask.

05:10.260 --> 05:13.480
But the one thing
that all held in common

05:13.600 --> 05:17.060
was there is a greater reality
in which we exist.

05:17.190 --> 05:21.900
NARRATOR: In the modern world,
there is an invisible sea of wireless data.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.860
Radio waves, microwaves,

05:24.990 --> 05:29.580
and various other frequencies
exist everywhere that go unseen.

05:29.700 --> 05:33.080
And in fact, what humans
are able to perceive

05:33.200 --> 05:35.580
with the naked eye
is extremely limited.

05:38.130 --> 05:44.840
The human visible spectrum goes
only from 380 to 770 nanometers.

05:44.970 --> 05:48.760
This means that humans
are only capable of perceiving

05:48.890 --> 05:52.890
one octave of light
of this entire spectrum.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.810
The fact that we cannot see
the rest of the spectrum

05:56.940 --> 05:59.730
does not mean it's not there.

05:59.860 --> 06:04.110
NARRATOR: Technology has enabled
humankind to become aware

06:04.230 --> 06:07.200
of much that cannot be perceived
with the five senses.

06:07.320 --> 06:11.370
But could there be far more
that exists, even outside

06:11.490 --> 06:16.040
the range of humanity's
most sophisticated technology?

06:16.160 --> 06:20.380
Perhaps even hidden dimensions
and alternate universes

06:20.500 --> 06:23.210
that exist
right next to our own.

06:23.340 --> 06:27.130
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, and point

06:27.260 --> 06:29.050
to cutting-edge
scientific research

06:29.180 --> 06:33.680
that may have located proof of
these alternate, unseen worlds.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.730
Pasadena, California.

06:41.230 --> 06:44.440
October 2015.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.280
A team of scientists

06:47.400 --> 06:49.950
at the California Institute
of Technology

06:50.070 --> 06:52.200
utilizes data collected

06:52.320 --> 06:54.700
by the powerful
Planck satellite telescope

06:54.830 --> 06:57.000
to examine physical evidence
of the Big Bang.

07:00.580 --> 07:03.590
To their astonishment,
they also discover evidence

07:03.710 --> 07:07.260
of so-called hot spots,
places where our universe

07:07.380 --> 07:11.220
could actually be coming
into contact with others.

07:12.930 --> 07:15.060
MICHAEL DENNIN: Picture
two balloons being blown up

07:15.180 --> 07:17.850
really close together,
and they happen to touch

07:17.970 --> 07:20.310
or bounce off each other,
or even just come very close

07:20.440 --> 07:22.060
enough to interact.

07:22.190 --> 07:24.690
That will leave an imprint
in our universe

07:24.820 --> 07:28.070
that will show up in this cosmic
microwave background signal.

07:30.110 --> 07:32.490
BRANDENBURG: This raises the
question, would we perceive

07:32.610 --> 07:35.160
other dimensions
and other universes

07:35.280 --> 07:37.330
with other dimensionalities?

07:37.450 --> 07:42.960
This also raises the question
of whether life and intelligence

07:43.080 --> 07:45.500
could exist in these
parallel universes,

07:45.630 --> 07:49.260
and would we perceive this as,
like, a ghost or a spirit?

07:49.380 --> 07:50.970
An angel?

07:51.090 --> 07:53.180
CHILDRESS: When we think of
the Brown Mountain Lights,

07:53.300 --> 07:56.010
it's quite possible that
they are interdimensional,

07:56.140 --> 07:57.970
or even from another universe.

07:58.100 --> 08:01.600
And it makes you wonder
what other unseen energies

08:01.730 --> 08:05.730
are everywhere that we're
unaware of and can't detect.

08:08.230 --> 08:09.990
NARRATOR:
Could the Brown Mountain Lights

08:10.110 --> 08:13.450
actually be emanating
from a parallel universe?

08:13.570 --> 08:17.160
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

08:17.280 --> 08:19.370
and they suggest

08:19.490 --> 08:21.870
that intimate knowledge
of these inhabited worlds

08:22.000 --> 08:25.790
can be found in the world's
most sacred texts.

08:32.169 --> 08:33.630
NARRATOR:
Seaford, New York.

08:33.760 --> 08:38.309
February 1958.

08:38.429 --> 08:42.020
In a relatively unassuming
suburban ranch home,

08:42.140 --> 08:46.980
an unseen force begins to
terrorize the Hermann family.

08:47.110 --> 08:51.400
Screw tops mysteriously
pop off bottles.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.610
Objects fly across the room.

08:53.740 --> 08:56.660
Furniture topples over.

08:56.780 --> 08:59.790
CHRISTOPHER BADER: After this
phenomenon went on for several weeks,

08:59.910 --> 09:01.620
the Hermanns became confused,

09:01.750 --> 09:04.250
perhaps even
a little bit frightened.

09:04.370 --> 09:06.710
They reported the phenomena
to the police department.

09:06.830 --> 09:08.460
A couple of police detectives
came over.

09:10.670 --> 09:12.710
YOUNG: A psychological
investigation would look into

09:12.840 --> 09:14.260
the family dynamics.

09:14.380 --> 09:16.550
Is there something happening
at this particular point

09:16.680 --> 09:19.260
in their journey
that causes distress

09:19.390 --> 09:22.470
they're not aware of so that
the physical vibrations

09:22.600 --> 09:24.310
would affect their surroundings?

09:27.350 --> 09:31.270
Eventually, the parapsychology
lab at Duke University came in

09:31.400 --> 09:32.690
to investigate the case.

09:32.820 --> 09:35.700
The Duke lab talked about
poltergeist phenomena

09:35.820 --> 09:38.070
as possibly the release
of emotional energy,

09:38.200 --> 09:40.280
particularly from adolescents
or young children,

09:40.410 --> 09:42.240
or kids going through puberty.

09:42.370 --> 09:44.120
The idea being that
they were confused,

09:44.250 --> 09:45.660
they didn't know what was
happening to their bodies,

09:45.790 --> 09:47.370
they had emotional energy
and trauma.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.790
They were operating
under the assumption

09:49.920 --> 09:53.210
that the poltergeist phenomena
was due to telekinetic energy

09:53.340 --> 09:55.630
being released by
the young boy in the family.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.720
These things were seen
by a whole group of people.

09:58.840 --> 10:01.930
Even some of the experts saw
the phenomenon.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.060
Can this be something
from another dimension?

10:05.180 --> 10:06.980
It's not clear.
Is this a group hallucination?

10:07.100 --> 10:10.770
Are they somehow channeling
the sighting to each other?

10:10.900 --> 10:13.860
The psychic expert said
it's often an adolescent girl,

10:13.980 --> 10:16.190
so she watched the girl
to see if somehow

10:16.320 --> 10:17.530
it was happening
when she was there.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.410
But it didn't really pan out,

10:19.530 --> 10:22.240
so it didn't follow
classic lines, and yet

10:22.370 --> 10:25.540
there were lots
of witnesses, experts,

10:25.660 --> 10:28.080
and no explanation
was ever found.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.250
Years later, Steven Spielberg
wove the tale

10:31.380 --> 10:34.500
into a fine movie
that was a big hit...

10:34.630 --> 10:36.460
<i>Poltergeist.</i>

10:38.840 --> 10:42.180
NARRATOR: If this poltergeist
event was not simply the result

10:42.300 --> 10:45.890
of telekinetic energy,
as some investigators suspected,

10:46.020 --> 10:47.810
then what can explain it?

10:47.930 --> 10:51.940
Was the Hermann family
really haunted by ghosts?

10:52.060 --> 10:54.400
Or could they have
encountered an entity

10:54.520 --> 10:56.280
from another dimension?

10:56.400 --> 10:58.860
We know science
has been able to measure

10:58.990 --> 11:03.070
all sorts of invisible things:
The electromagnetic field,

11:03.200 --> 11:07.200
the heat signature
of objects and people.

11:07.330 --> 11:10.620
So the fact that we don't see it
doesn't mean it's not there.

11:10.750 --> 11:14.670
Any contact that we have
with an interdimensional being

11:14.790 --> 11:19.420
is actually happening beyond
our normal visual spectrum.

11:19.550 --> 11:22.260
There is no question in my mind

11:22.390 --> 11:26.100
that there is more
than one species

11:26.220 --> 11:29.810
right here on the Earth
that is operating

11:29.940 --> 11:32.940
within different
frequency ranges.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.730
That's why we don't
really see them.

11:35.860 --> 11:40.450
Most of our extraterrestrial
encounters are interdimensional.

11:40.570 --> 11:44.120
These beings
are not coming from far away,

11:44.240 --> 11:48.120
they are actually
within our human plane,

11:48.240 --> 11:50.870
only existing
in another dimension.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.920
And all we're doing is crossing
from one dimension to another

11:56.040 --> 11:59.210
within this earthly reality.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.720
It doesn't mean that all
extraterrestrial encounter

12:01.840 --> 12:03.300
is interdimensional.

12:03.430 --> 12:05.640
In fact, I believe it's both.

12:05.760 --> 12:10.270
NARRATOR: Could the Hermann
poltergeist and others like it

12:10.390 --> 12:13.850
have been caused by beings
from another dimension?

12:13.980 --> 12:16.360
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

12:16.480 --> 12:19.820
that such an audacious concept
is possible,

12:19.940 --> 12:23.240
and believe this could also
help explain the existence

12:23.360 --> 12:27.870
of everything from so-called
ghosts to angels and demons.

12:27.990 --> 12:30.040
For their proof,

12:30.160 --> 12:32.370
they point to a particular
phrase found

12:32.500 --> 12:34.830
in multiple religious texts.

12:34.960 --> 12:39.130
A phrase in the Hebrew Talmud,
as well as the Quran,

12:39.250 --> 12:41.010
which details the existence

12:41.130 --> 12:45.220
of seven levels
of heaven and Earth.

12:45.340 --> 12:48.220
TZADOK: What are the
seven levels of heaven?

12:48.350 --> 12:49.600
Some associate them
with the different planets

12:49.720 --> 12:51.390
of our solar system.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.940
But others refer to them
as being parallel dimensions.

12:55.060 --> 12:58.650
So when we speak
of the other worlds,

12:58.770 --> 13:03.320
which people have interacted
with throughout the centuries,

13:03.450 --> 13:06.700
maybe we're not really dealing
with extraterrestrials

13:06.820 --> 13:09.120
from outer space,

13:09.240 --> 13:15.000
but ultra-terrestrials
coming from parallel space.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.830
NARRATOR: Could it be that what are
commonly understood to be ghosts

13:17.960 --> 13:20.210
are not spirits of the deceased,

13:20.340 --> 13:23.260
but entities
from other dimensions

13:23.380 --> 13:26.550
that, while able to manipulate
things in our world,

13:26.680 --> 13:30.100
cannot be fully perceived
by humans?

13:32.890 --> 13:35.310
Jabal al-Nour,

13:35.440 --> 13:39.610
six miles north
of Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

13:39.730 --> 13:43.030
602 AD.

13:43.150 --> 13:46.320
While in deep meditation
within the Hira Cave,

13:46.450 --> 13:50.700
the prophet Muhammad is visited
by an otherworldly messenger,

13:50.830 --> 13:53.410
the archangel Gabriel.

13:53.540 --> 13:57.500
HENRY: Muhammad was meditating
in a cave when suddenly,

13:57.620 --> 14:02.210
as if out of nowhere, the
archangel Gabriel manifested.

14:02.340 --> 14:05.670
In the Quran, they describe
Gabriel as standing on

14:05.800 --> 14:07.930
or between horizons.

14:08.050 --> 14:09.930
This is a tip-off
that we're dealing

14:10.050 --> 14:12.390
with an interdimensional being.

14:12.510 --> 14:15.560
Because in ancient texts, it
means that they had the ability

14:15.680 --> 14:20.020
to phase in between dimensions,
to take on a physical form

14:20.150 --> 14:23.650
and then to revert
back to their light body form.

14:23.780 --> 14:27.030
NARRATOR: According to
the Islamic tradition,

14:27.150 --> 14:31.870
Gabriel provided Muhammad
revelations direct from Allah.

14:31.990 --> 14:34.290
These teachings
would inform the Quran,

14:34.410 --> 14:37.000
and become the basis
for the Muslim faith,

14:37.120 --> 14:40.080
the second largest religion
in the world.

14:40.210 --> 14:43.090
Might it really be
that the messenger Gabriel

14:43.210 --> 14:46.420
was an interdimensional being
from an unseen realm

14:46.550 --> 14:49.010
here to assist humankind?

14:49.130 --> 14:50.970
CHILDRESS:
Here we have

14:51.090 --> 14:54.890
an angel who's basically acting
like an extraterrestrial

14:55.010 --> 14:57.310
who even has
some kind of aircraft

14:57.430 --> 14:59.600
that he's flying Muhammad
around in.

14:59.730 --> 15:01.690
When we think of space travel

15:01.810 --> 15:04.070
and encounters
with extraterrestrials,

15:04.190 --> 15:06.440
it's quite possible
that they are using

15:06.570 --> 15:10.740
some interdimensional way of
traveling, but it doesn't mean

15:10.860 --> 15:13.280
that they are necessarily
interdimensional,

15:13.410 --> 15:16.660
or even from another universe,
but they have the technology

15:16.790 --> 15:20.170
to go from one dimension
to another,

15:20.290 --> 15:25.300
to appear and disappear, and it
all has to do with technology.

15:25.420 --> 15:27.590
NARRATOR:
Could it really be

15:27.710 --> 15:31.720
that religious prophets
like Muhammad have gained access

15:31.840 --> 15:35.100
to parallel dimensions
beyond our known reality?

15:35.220 --> 15:38.470
Dimensions from which they
and other advanced beings

15:38.600 --> 15:41.980
might access our world
via interdimensional highways

15:42.100 --> 15:46.360
that allow them to move without
any space or time restrictions?

15:46.480 --> 15:49.900
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

15:50.030 --> 15:53.780
and suggest further evidence
can be found by examining

15:53.910 --> 15:57.160
a shamanistic practice
in Australia that dates back

15:57.290 --> 16:01.120
thousands of years: Dreamtime.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.260
NARRATOR:
The Australian Outback.

16:10.380 --> 16:13.680
Located hundreds of miles
from the bustle

16:13.800 --> 16:17.310
of the major city centers
of Sydney and Melbourne,

16:17.430 --> 16:20.480
this sparsely-populated region
of the continent

16:20.600 --> 16:22.810
is home
to an indigenous population

16:22.940 --> 16:27.570
that can trace their roots
back over 40,000 years.

16:27.690 --> 16:30.280
Through ceremonial trances,

16:30.400 --> 16:33.910
elders claim to be able
to freely access a realm

16:34.030 --> 16:37.490
where they connect
with ancestral beings.

16:37.620 --> 16:40.830
They refer to this alternate
reality as the Dreaming,

16:40.950 --> 16:43.290
or Dreamtime.

16:43.410 --> 16:45.210
YOUNG: The task of the traveler,
the dreamer,

16:45.330 --> 16:48.340
is to connect the two worlds,
is to bring the reality

16:48.460 --> 16:50.630
of the dream...
Which they consider superior

16:50.760 --> 16:52.880
to the reality
of what we call waking life...

16:53.010 --> 16:58.350
To bring that over because it is
full of guidance and treasures.

16:58.470 --> 17:01.680
Dreamtime allows the indigenous
people of Australia

17:01.810 --> 17:03.850
to travel back in time,

17:03.980 --> 17:07.690
or at least visit with ancestors
very far back in time.

17:07.810 --> 17:10.940
They say back
to their original ancestors.

17:11.069 --> 17:14.819
NARRATOR: The Aboriginal
artwork depicts these ancestors

17:14.950 --> 17:17.740
with oblong heads
and large eyes,

17:17.869 --> 17:19.910
an appearance
that ancient astronaut theorists

17:20.030 --> 17:21.619
find eerily similar

17:21.740 --> 17:25.579
to modern-day accounts
of Grey aliens.

17:25.710 --> 17:31.090
But Australia's Dreamtime
is not an isolated anomaly.

17:31.210 --> 17:35.760
In fact, shamans and holy men
in numerous other world cultures

17:35.880 --> 17:39.350
speak of alternate realms.

17:39.470 --> 17:43.140
Throughout Asia,
Hindus and Buddhists believe

17:43.270 --> 17:46.060
in the existence
of infinite universes.

17:46.190 --> 17:50.440
The Yoruba of West Africa
believe another realm exists

17:50.570 --> 17:53.110
above the physical realm.

17:53.230 --> 17:57.200
In the Kabbalah, it is taught
that there are 125 levels

17:57.320 --> 18:00.450
between humans and the creator.

18:00.580 --> 18:05.330
And even in North America, many
native tribes perform ceremonies

18:05.460 --> 18:08.920
that connect them
with unseen entities.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.040
But if spiritual leaders

18:11.170 --> 18:14.340
really are able to see
into other dimensions,

18:14.460 --> 18:16.920
is it possible
that there may be a way

18:17.050 --> 18:21.100
for all humans
to obtain such vision?

18:21.220 --> 18:24.720
The Upper Amazon region
of South America.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.770
For hundreds of years,
medicine men here

18:28.900 --> 18:32.820
have utilized a plant-based drug
called ayahuasca

18:32.940 --> 18:37.490
for healing and to access
otherworldly realms.

18:37.610 --> 18:39.070
YOUNG:
In these ceremonies

18:39.200 --> 18:40.870
and altered states
that are conjured up

18:40.990 --> 18:43.280
in the Amazon and other places,

18:43.410 --> 18:47.660
there is information
that seems to be of great value.

18:47.790 --> 18:53.340
Ayahuasca makes the curtains
between realities vanish.

18:53.460 --> 18:57.380
Such journeys are central to
shamanistic initiatory rituals.

18:57.510 --> 19:00.890
Whether they are breaking
through to parallel realities

19:01.010 --> 19:02.720
or exploring
the hidden dimensions

19:02.850 --> 19:04.930
of their own inner worlds,

19:05.060 --> 19:08.020
these experiences
are dramatically significant

19:08.140 --> 19:10.440
in the lives of the travelers.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.190
HENRY:
One of the great revelations

19:12.310 --> 19:13.820
of the ayahuasca experience

19:13.940 --> 19:17.820
is that they experience
ancient ancestors

19:17.940 --> 19:20.570
as well
as extraterrestrial beings,

19:20.700 --> 19:22.530
suggesting that, in fact,
the ancestors

19:22.660 --> 19:25.030
and the extraterrestrials
are the same beings.

19:28.370 --> 19:29.960
NARRATOR:
The ayahuasca brew

19:30.080 --> 19:32.040
is made from two ingredients:

19:32.170 --> 19:34.840
A root from one specific plant,

19:34.960 --> 19:38.300
and a leaf from
an entirely different species.

19:38.420 --> 19:41.430
The active ingredient
in the prepared concoction

19:41.550 --> 19:44.470
is dimethyltryptamine, or DMT.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.140
This powerful
psychedelic chemical

19:47.270 --> 19:50.980
is found in small quantities
within the human body.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.900
The substance is believed
to be released

19:54.020 --> 19:57.360
into the human endocrine system
and floods the pineal gland

19:57.480 --> 20:01.030
upon death and during
near-death experiences.

20:01.150 --> 20:04.320
While mainstream scientists
consider the action

20:04.450 --> 20:07.790
of the ayahuasca
to be purely hallucinogenic,

20:07.910 --> 20:10.870
some modern researchers believe

20:11.000 --> 20:14.670
the substance can open doorways
to new realities.

20:22.010 --> 20:25.720
McQUEEN:
DMT seems to be able to alter

20:25.850 --> 20:30.520
our brain wiring in a way
that allows us to perceive

20:30.640 --> 20:33.230
in more than four dimensions.

20:33.350 --> 20:37.400
Dimethyltryptamine might be
the mechanism to allow

20:37.520 --> 20:42.280
our perception of these
other alternate realities.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.070
It's like the key to a receiver.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.740
You pop the key into
the receiver and it activates

20:47.870 --> 20:51.870
not just a part of the brain,
it literally reorients

20:52.000 --> 20:53.660
all of the receivers
in the brain

20:53.790 --> 20:56.420
to pick up more information.

20:56.540 --> 21:00.250
NARRATOR: The question of
just how ancient healers

21:00.380 --> 21:03.260
stumbled across
this particular combination

21:03.380 --> 21:05.340
in a jungle containing
tens of thousands

21:05.470 --> 21:10.260
of plant and vine species
remains a mystery.

21:10.390 --> 21:12.060
CHILDRESS:
What we're looking at here

21:12.180 --> 21:15.940
are incredible,
remarkable plants

21:16.060 --> 21:19.440
that are using receptors
in our brains to help us

21:19.570 --> 21:22.820
have these
otherworldly experiences,

21:22.940 --> 21:26.610
contact otherworldly beings.

21:26.740 --> 21:31.990
So who has created this
incredible biological catalyst

21:32.120 --> 21:34.410
for humans to use?

21:34.540 --> 21:38.040
You have to wonder if
extraterrestrials themselves

21:38.170 --> 21:40.000
didn't have a hand in this.

21:40.130 --> 21:43.880
NARRATOR: Could it really be
that our ancient ancestors

21:44.010 --> 21:47.050
were given the key
to access hidden worlds

21:47.180 --> 21:49.640
by extraterrestrial beings?

21:49.760 --> 21:52.970
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

21:53.100 --> 21:55.730
and suggest
that modern-day research

21:55.850 --> 21:58.270
may be rediscovering
the potential

21:58.400 --> 22:01.820
of these psychedelic substances.

22:01.940 --> 22:04.690
Boulder, Colorado.

22:04.820 --> 22:07.240
Psychologists

22:07.360 --> 22:09.820
at the Center
for Medicinal Mindfulness

22:09.950 --> 22:12.990
explore the therapeutic benefits
of psychedelic agents

22:13.120 --> 22:14.660
in cases of trauma,

22:14.790 --> 22:17.500
depression and addiction.

22:17.620 --> 22:21.130
Along with psychedelic cannabis,
researchers explore

22:21.250 --> 22:24.960
the effects of DMT
on the human mind.

22:25.090 --> 22:28.680
Curiously,
experiencers often claim

22:28.800 --> 22:31.640
to not only be able to see
alternate realities,

22:31.760 --> 22:34.430
but also to have
two-way communication

22:34.560 --> 22:38.480
with inhabitants
of these hidden worlds.

22:38.600 --> 22:42.520
Some people have experiences
of angelic beings,

22:42.650 --> 22:44.940
some people have
what would be considered

22:45.070 --> 22:47.650
classical alien abduction
experiences,

22:47.780 --> 22:50.990
where they feel like
they're being pulled into space

22:51.120 --> 22:54.450
and either operated on, uh,
healed in some way.

22:54.580 --> 22:57.330
And that some are experiencing

22:57.460 --> 23:00.370
hyper-technological civilization

23:00.500 --> 23:04.130
that somehow evolved
beyond four-dimensional spaces,

23:04.250 --> 23:06.510
and that they're
helping us wake up

23:06.630 --> 23:09.680
to that capacity in ourselves.

23:09.800 --> 23:13.010
NARRATOR:
Many who use these drugs

23:13.140 --> 23:16.060
believe they connect them
to an even greater reality,

23:16.180 --> 23:20.100
allowing them to channel
communication from unseen realms

23:20.230 --> 23:22.650
that exist all around us.

23:22.770 --> 23:25.860
But is it possible that
some people are able to access

23:25.980 --> 23:28.690
other dimensions without the aid

23:28.820 --> 23:31.910
of psychedelic agents
or spiritual ceremonies?

23:32.030 --> 23:35.160
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

23:35.280 --> 23:38.450
and, as evidence,
point to modern day seers

23:38.580 --> 23:41.670
who claim to be able to observe
events that are happening

23:41.790 --> 23:44.250
in another place and time.

23:52.010 --> 23:54.430
NARRATOR:
Menlo Park, California.

23:54.550 --> 23:56.760
The 1970s.

23:56.890 --> 24:00.310
The United States
Central Intelligence Agency

24:00.430 --> 24:03.440
enlists scientists at the
Stanford Research Institute

24:03.560 --> 24:06.610
for a highly classified,
and controversial study.

24:06.730 --> 24:09.070
They want to test

24:09.190 --> 24:11.360
whether psychics
can be effectively used

24:11.490 --> 24:14.280
for intelligence gathering.

24:14.410 --> 24:16.080
VIVANCO:
Remote viewing is developed

24:16.200 --> 24:20.080
in the early 1970s
at the request of the CIA,

24:20.200 --> 24:22.420
and what they found was that,

24:22.540 --> 24:25.080
yes, they could
turn psychics into spies.

24:25.210 --> 24:27.210
This developed
into a full protocol

24:27.340 --> 24:30.380
and a methodology in order to

24:30.510 --> 24:32.880
send people to remote locations

24:33.010 --> 24:35.720
that they could not send
physical people

24:35.850 --> 24:38.180
and get information,
bring it back.

24:38.310 --> 24:42.310
NARRATOR: Five decades later,
many law enforcement agencies

24:42.440 --> 24:45.100
continue to consider
remote viewing a valuable tool,

24:45.230 --> 24:49.360
but just how it works
remains a mystery.

24:49.480 --> 24:53.200
The way that I perceive
remote viewing to work

24:53.320 --> 24:55.490
is outside of space time.

24:55.610 --> 24:59.160
We move through another
dimension, in a sense,

24:59.290 --> 25:01.580
outside of our
3-D physical reality

25:01.700 --> 25:03.790
to gain information.

25:03.910 --> 25:05.830
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that remote viewers

25:05.960 --> 25:09.130
are able to witness events
happening in distant locations

25:09.250 --> 25:11.130
because they are
actually traveling,

25:11.260 --> 25:15.430
not physically, but mentally
through other dimensions?

25:15.550 --> 25:18.100
Does the key to accessing
alternate realms

25:18.220 --> 25:19.850
exist within the mind?

25:24.690 --> 25:27.440
In May 2019,

25:27.560 --> 25:29.020
Former British
intelligence officer,

25:29.150 --> 25:31.480
Nick Pope,
visited the ECETI Ranch

25:31.610 --> 25:34.700
in the Pacific Northwest
to witness this theory

25:34.820 --> 25:36.360
being put to the test.

25:36.490 --> 25:40.370
ECETI is home to the
Enlightened Contact

25:40.490 --> 25:43.290
with Extraterrestrial
Intelligence Organization.

25:43.410 --> 25:46.960
UFO hunters consider it
a major hot spot

25:47.080 --> 25:49.170
for unexplained
aerial phenomena.

25:49.290 --> 25:53.800
Over the past 33 years,
scientists from Boeing,

25:53.920 --> 25:55.930
NASA and Lockheed Skunk Works

25:56.050 --> 26:00.140
have come to ECETI to research
the activity in the sky.

26:00.260 --> 26:05.560
But what sets ECETI apart from
other UFO watch organizations

26:05.680 --> 26:08.350
is that their most powerful
observational tool

26:08.480 --> 26:12.230
is not a telescope,
it's remote viewers.

26:12.360 --> 26:15.650
I was in charge
of the British government's

26:15.780 --> 26:18.610
real-life X-files project.

26:18.740 --> 26:22.490
We looked at UFOs, crop circles,
alien abductions.

26:22.620 --> 26:24.160
Anything mysterious

26:24.290 --> 26:26.580
and unexplained, I did it.

26:26.710 --> 26:32.630
Remote viewing might be tapping
into unknown dimensions.

26:32.750 --> 26:35.710
I know this sounds like science
fiction, but actually it isn't.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.680
Some of the work being done
at places like

26:37.800 --> 26:40.180
the Large Hadron Collider
are now

26:40.300 --> 26:42.430
quite seriously looking
at the concept

26:42.560 --> 26:44.930
of other dimensions.

26:45.060 --> 26:48.690
NARRATOR: At ECETI,
ex-government remote viewing expert,

26:48.810 --> 26:50.650
- John Vivanco...
- Hi, there.

26:50.770 --> 26:53.190
NARRATOR: And UFO sky
watcher, Peter Slattery,

26:53.320 --> 26:55.570
lead a team of remote viewers.

26:55.690 --> 26:58.990
Today they are working
on an experiment

26:59.110 --> 27:02.410
that will combine human
observation and remote viewing

27:02.530 --> 27:04.990
in an attempt
to better understand

27:05.120 --> 27:07.910
what has become a recent
increase in UFO sightings

27:08.040 --> 27:10.620
over Washington state's
Mount Adams.

27:10.750 --> 27:13.290
So let me know, please,

27:13.420 --> 27:15.710
what are your respective
backgrounds with this?

27:15.840 --> 27:17.970
I am a remote viewer.
I've been, uh,

27:18.090 --> 27:20.130
doing this professionally
for 20 years,

27:20.260 --> 27:22.970
over 20 years now, and I run
a team of remote viewers,

27:23.100 --> 27:25.470
and we work operational type
projects for clients,

27:25.600 --> 27:28.810
and we look at different types
of phenomena

27:28.930 --> 27:31.730
that can't be explained
through conventional means.

27:31.850 --> 27:34.230
I'm known as an experiencer
slash contactee,

27:34.360 --> 27:36.190
but also I hold
sky watch events.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.190
So we're gonna do a sky watch
and just see what happens.

27:38.320 --> 27:39.610
Where are we gonna do that?

27:39.740 --> 27:41.700
We're just gonna go to the
sky watch field here,

27:41.820 --> 27:43.530
- so let's go and check it out.
- Okay, great.

27:43.660 --> 27:46.700
NARRATOR: As Nick joins Peter
to conduct field surveillance,

27:46.830 --> 27:51.210
John has stationed two remote
viewers in a windowless room,

27:51.330 --> 27:54.920
armed with nothing more
than a pencil and a drawing pad.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.960
The way it works is that
a remote viewer

27:58.090 --> 28:00.800
is given a random
eight-digit number

28:00.930 --> 28:03.590
connected to what they're
supposed to remote view.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.470
Now they don't get what they're
supposed to remote view,

28:06.600 --> 28:09.060
only the number, that's it.

28:09.180 --> 28:12.650
They're gonna be at the location
of whatever it is,

28:12.770 --> 28:14.690
through the mind describing

28:14.810 --> 28:15.900
exactly what that is.

28:17.820 --> 28:19.900
So what are these
remote viewers actually

28:20.030 --> 28:21.360
gonna be doing in there?

28:21.490 --> 28:24.280
It's not so much viewing;
We get visual snippets

28:24.410 --> 28:26.330
and a lot of body sensations.

28:26.450 --> 28:28.330
Basically, they're gonna be
drawing and writing

28:28.450 --> 28:30.120
a lot on papers.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.330
And afterwards, once we've

28:32.460 --> 28:35.580
got the data, how are we
actually going to analyze it?

28:35.710 --> 28:38.500
So I will collect
that information

28:38.630 --> 28:39.960
from them when they're done,

28:40.090 --> 28:42.300
and then in the morning
we can meet up

28:42.420 --> 28:43.970
and see if we can
come up with, uh,

28:44.090 --> 28:45.510
some explanation
for what went on.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.850
Well, great, that sounds good.

28:47.970 --> 28:49.470
I hope that we're
gonna have some

28:49.600 --> 28:52.140
interesting
and meaningful results.

28:52.270 --> 28:56.190
NARRATOR: After discussing the
details of the evening's plans,

28:56.310 --> 28:58.770
Peter and Nick
part ways with John

28:58.900 --> 29:01.740
and join the rest of the
sky watch team in the field.

29:01.860 --> 29:04.860
Pete, I see the team
has grown somewhat.

29:04.990 --> 29:06.370
SLATTERY:
We've got Adam here with us.

29:06.490 --> 29:07.870
He's gonna be helping out
with the satellite

29:07.990 --> 29:09.370
tracker and-and
monitoring the gear.

29:09.490 --> 29:11.830
It's just very important
to be very quick off the mark,

29:11.950 --> 29:13.580
knowing what's what.

29:13.710 --> 29:16.420
Sometimes we can have two things
in the sky at the same time,

29:16.540 --> 29:18.290
and one of them could be
a satellite, the other not.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.630
People can mix it up,

29:19.750 --> 29:21.090
so when we're focused
on the sky, it's great

29:21.210 --> 29:23.050
that somebody's focused
on the satellite tracker.

29:23.170 --> 29:25.220
Great, so we're
essentially making sure

29:25.340 --> 29:26.590
- we don't miss anything?
- Oh, definitely, yeah.

29:26.720 --> 29:28.430
We don't want
to muddle things up.

29:28.550 --> 29:31.600
NARRATOR: The team gets to work
setting up the watch station

29:31.720 --> 29:34.980
before the Sun goes down
for the evening.

29:35.100 --> 29:38.110
They will be using various
technology, including

29:38.230 --> 29:40.190
infrared cameras
in order to capture

29:40.320 --> 29:42.650
any anomalies in the sky.

29:42.780 --> 29:47.160
The location for their watch
overlooks Mount Adams,

29:47.280 --> 29:51.450
the largest active volcano in
Washington state and a hot spot

29:51.580 --> 29:53.580
for UFO sightings.

29:53.700 --> 29:55.080
In fact,

29:55.210 --> 29:58.250
Mount Adams is associated
with the first UFO case

29:58.380 --> 30:01.670
to ever make
nationwide headlines.

30:04.550 --> 30:06.880
In June of 1947,

30:07.010 --> 30:09.930
aviator and businessman
Kenneth Arnold

30:10.050 --> 30:13.430
claimed to have witnessed
nine UFOs flying in tandem

30:13.560 --> 30:17.980
from Mount Rainier
at incredible speeds.

30:18.100 --> 30:23.110
He reported that they performed
a number of unusual maneuvers

30:23.230 --> 30:27.650
and then disappeared
into Mount Adams.

30:27.780 --> 30:29.410
As night sets in,

30:29.530 --> 30:32.620
the team has all eyes
glued to the sky

30:32.740 --> 30:34.080
and on the lookout
for any objects

30:34.200 --> 30:36.460
that might cross their path.

30:36.580 --> 30:41.170
Utilizing real-time
satellite tracking data,

30:41.290 --> 30:44.380
they can anticipate the arrival
of all manmade traffic

30:44.510 --> 30:47.050
passing over their airspace.

30:47.170 --> 30:48.680
- SLATTERY: Hey, is that a satellite?
- WALLBERG: Yup.

30:48.800 --> 30:51.510
NARRATOR: Including the
International Space Station,

30:51.640 --> 30:53.600
or ISS.

30:53.720 --> 30:56.060
POPE: Adam, how are we on
the timing with the ISS?

30:56.180 --> 30:57.600
WALLBERG:
Uh, one more minute.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.850
POPE:
And which direction? West?

30:59.980 --> 31:02.730
Uh, it's gonna be coming from
the west moving to the east.

31:02.860 --> 31:04.110
Look at how bright
this thing is.

31:04.230 --> 31:06.150
Whoa! Oh, there it is there.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.450
See?

31:08.570 --> 31:10.910
- That's the space station. Can you see that?
- WALLBERG: That's the ISS, yep.

31:11.030 --> 31:12.910
POPE:
Okay.

31:13.030 --> 31:16.660
NARRATOR: While the field
team watches the sky,

31:16.790 --> 31:19.410
the remote viewers are sketching

31:19.540 --> 31:22.380
visual representations
of whatever comes to them.

31:22.500 --> 31:27.460
Incredibly, as the International
Space Station passes overhead,

31:27.590 --> 31:30.470
both women begin to draw
virtually identical

31:30.590 --> 31:32.640
rectangular objects.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.220
Well, it's not a UFO,

31:35.350 --> 31:38.270
but it's still
a pretty spectacular thing.

31:38.390 --> 31:40.270
Yeah, it's pretty epic to see.

31:40.390 --> 31:44.570
NARRATOR: After spotting a few
other satellites in the sky,

31:44.690 --> 31:47.110
Nick and Peter notice
a mysterious,

31:47.230 --> 31:48.860
fast-moving object,

31:48.990 --> 31:51.360
one that does not appear
to be a satellite.

31:51.490 --> 31:53.700
SLATTERY: There's one
right there right now.

31:53.820 --> 31:56.740
Look how quick it is.
Is that a satellite?

31:56.870 --> 31:58.830
I've got it on camera.

31:58.950 --> 32:01.040
- WALLBERG: Where are you at?
- SLATTERY: East,

32:01.170 --> 32:03.130
southeast.

32:05.210 --> 32:07.210
WALLBERG:
I see nothing on the tracker.

32:07.340 --> 32:09.670
SLATTERY:
Can you see it up here, guys?

32:09.800 --> 32:13.010
Okay, I definitely saw it up
in that section of the sky

32:13.140 --> 32:14.930
with my naked eye.

32:15.050 --> 32:18.180
It-it just caught my attention
out of the corner of my eye.

32:18.310 --> 32:21.560
I turned around,
saw it for a few seconds,

32:21.690 --> 32:23.850
- and then it faded.
- That's exactly what I saw.

32:23.980 --> 32:25.810
POPE:
And there was nothing

32:25.940 --> 32:28.230
- on the monitor at all?
- Nope, nothing at all.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.400
That section of the sky
was clear.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.610
POPE:
And that's satellites.

32:32.740 --> 32:35.780
What about aircraft
and flight paths?

32:35.910 --> 32:38.950
- ADAM: Nope, everything was clear.
- Okay.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.790
Well, it was something.

32:41.910 --> 32:45.750
NARRATOR: No satellites or
aircraft on the tracking monitor?

32:45.880 --> 32:48.210
Is it possible

32:48.340 --> 32:52.340
that the team just saw
an extraterrestrial spacecraft?

32:52.470 --> 32:58.310
And if so, was it also recorded
by the remote viewers?

33:08.110 --> 33:12.150
NARRATOR: ECETI Ranch,
Trout Lake, Washington.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.990
The morning
after successfully capturing

33:15.110 --> 33:17.950
an anomalous object during their
evening sky watch session...

33:18.080 --> 33:20.540
- John, good to see you again.
- Good to see you, Nick.

33:20.660 --> 33:23.040
NARRATOR: Nick Pope
meets up with John Vivanco

33:23.160 --> 33:26.540
to see how the remote viewing
portion of the experiment went.

33:26.670 --> 33:28.880
Nick is eager to discover

33:29.000 --> 33:32.380
if the remote viewers picked up
the same objects in the sky

33:32.510 --> 33:34.470
that he witnessed
with his own eyes,

33:34.590 --> 33:38.640
and perhaps even perceived
additional details.

33:40.890 --> 33:43.930
So the remote viewers
were tasked

33:44.060 --> 33:46.270
on two different things
last night,

33:46.400 --> 33:50.400
and I wanted them
to describe the first object

33:50.520 --> 33:54.030
on the sky watch that was
determined to be a satellite.

33:54.150 --> 33:57.610
Right. So they have no idea
that you are asking them

33:57.740 --> 33:59.320
- to look at a satellite...
- No.

33:59.450 --> 34:01.290
And that the satellite
is-is almost the target?

34:01.410 --> 34:03.700
Exactly. So are you ready
to go through the first one?

34:03.830 --> 34:06.920
- Yes.
- Okay.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.840
So this right here is energy.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.630
This is determined to be energy
by this remote viewer,

34:12.750 --> 34:15.010
and talking about
how it's crackling,

34:15.130 --> 34:17.340
hits and bounces of burst.
It's like static.

34:17.469 --> 34:19.219
So this is a mixture,
essentially,

34:19.340 --> 34:22.260
of almost like
a stream of consciousness,

34:22.389 --> 34:24.350
- what they are describing here in words.
- Right, exactly, right.

34:24.469 --> 34:26.600
POPE: And then a visual
representation of it.

34:26.730 --> 34:27.940
VIVANCO:
Mm-hmm. Right.

34:28.060 --> 34:29.440
Let me show you the next scan.

34:29.560 --> 34:32.400
This subject is talking about

34:32.520 --> 34:36.570
a dense material, thick gray,
cylindrical object.

34:36.699 --> 34:42.870
Now, this different viewer
is getting the same type of box.

34:42.989 --> 34:45.330
- It's got lights blinking.
- POPE: And these are

34:45.449 --> 34:46.909
completely independent
from each other?

34:47.040 --> 34:50.380
- Right.
- Wow. One, two, pretty much the same.

34:50.500 --> 34:54.130
- VIVANCO: Pretty much the same.
- Wow. Impressive.

34:54.250 --> 34:56.300
So, but let me
show you this here.

34:56.420 --> 34:59.340
There's a burst of communication
is what I find interesting.

34:59.470 --> 35:03.310
And you have these, uh, almost
looks like solar panels on it.

35:03.430 --> 35:04.720
POPE:
Now, we actually saw

35:04.850 --> 35:06.140
the International Space Station
last night,

35:06.270 --> 35:10.150
and it actually has those
two separate light panels,

35:10.270 --> 35:11.360
like, what makes it different

35:11.480 --> 35:13.520
from most
conventional satellites.

35:13.650 --> 35:15.900
- Could this be what we're looking at here?
- VIVANCO: Absolutely.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.530
If what you saw first identified
as a satellite,

35:18.650 --> 35:20.530
- then, yeah, absolutely.
- Wow.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.160
NARRATOR:
Two separate remote viewers,

35:23.280 --> 35:26.660
both depicting objects that
are consistent with the makeup

35:26.790 --> 35:29.460
of the International
Space Station.

35:29.580 --> 35:33.630
It is an impressive coincidence,
but not as impressive

35:33.750 --> 35:38.220
as what John Vivanco
is about to reveal to Nick Pope,

35:38.340 --> 35:43.140
as concerns the mysterious UFO
they spotted in the night sky.

35:43.260 --> 35:45.930
So that's a bona fide UFO.
We can't explain that.

35:46.060 --> 35:49.560
And it blinked out.
It completely disappeared.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.940
What was the first thing
you saw?

35:52.060 --> 35:54.190
Well, the first anomalous thing
we saw

35:54.310 --> 35:56.320
was a flash of light in the sky.

35:56.440 --> 35:57.820
I saw it myself.

35:57.940 --> 36:00.320
We had a satellite tracker
up and running.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.280
We eliminated that possibility.
There was no satellite.

36:03.410 --> 36:06.240
- So this was anomalous.
- That's interesting.

36:06.370 --> 36:08.290
VIVANCO:
So we get to this page here.

36:08.410 --> 36:10.250
Now they're getting
an energy and a structure.

36:10.370 --> 36:12.460
It's this reflective, metallic,

36:12.580 --> 36:15.750
the feeling thing,
almost like a mirage.

36:15.880 --> 36:19.010
Glowing blue color,
very faint pinging sound.

36:19.130 --> 36:20.590
That's interesting.

36:20.720 --> 36:22.590
POPE:
This is a visual representation?

36:22.720 --> 36:24.640
This is visual representation,
so...

36:24.760 --> 36:26.970
- POPE: And it says energy, so...
- Energy, right.

36:27.100 --> 36:29.980
Energy seems to be moving
outward in many directions.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.980
So I think what they're trying
to do here is display

36:32.100 --> 36:34.480
- the energy, the ball.
- Right.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.440
All right.

36:36.570 --> 36:39.230
You prepare
to be weirded out here.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.940
POPE:
Okay.

36:41.070 --> 36:43.410
VIVANCO:
This subject is described

36:43.530 --> 36:45.200
as a crystal blue color.

36:45.320 --> 36:48.370
It's angelic and floaty.

36:48.490 --> 36:49.950
Wow.

36:50.080 --> 36:53.500
So is this a person?
What is this?

36:53.620 --> 36:55.750
VIVANCO:
I'm not sure what this is.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.710
This subject here, I mean, uh,

36:57.840 --> 37:02.220
this-this is clearly some sort
of person, or-or is it?

37:02.340 --> 37:04.890
I mean, if we're talking about
something anomalous,

37:05.010 --> 37:08.260
is the possibility here that,
if this was a UFO,

37:08.390 --> 37:09.510
that this is some sort
of occupant?

37:09.640 --> 37:11.480
VIVANCO:
There is that possibility.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.100
NARRATOR:
An occupant?

37:14.230 --> 37:18.150
Did this remote viewer actually
see inside the object

37:18.270 --> 37:21.570
that the field team witnessed
from the ground?

37:21.690 --> 37:24.990
And if so, could this confirm
that what they saw

37:25.110 --> 37:29.120
was an extraterrestrial
spacecraft?

37:29.240 --> 37:32.870
VIVANCO: This remote viewer is
also getting a subject here,

37:33.000 --> 37:36.500
and they are calling this flash
of light a subject,

37:36.630 --> 37:38.590
which is curious.

37:38.710 --> 37:42.050
And when you see this,
uppercase P and a lowercase P,

37:42.170 --> 37:44.880
they mean that subject is
a paraphysical,

37:45.010 --> 37:47.590
which means, in remote viewing,
it is something

37:47.720 --> 37:49.600
outside of our 3-D reality.

37:49.720 --> 37:52.180
So this subject, according to
this remote viewer,

37:52.310 --> 37:55.060
is a flash of light
on the mountain,

37:55.190 --> 37:58.560
and this subject exists outside
of our 3-D reality.

37:58.690 --> 37:59.770
- That is spooky. I mean...
- Yeah.

37:59.900 --> 38:02.030
We saw a flash of light
on the mountain.

38:02.150 --> 38:06.240
Are we saying here that this
flashing light on the mountain,

38:06.360 --> 38:09.320
and that these sessions suggest
that this is, like,

38:09.450 --> 38:12.240
- something to do with extraterrestrials?
- You know,

38:12.370 --> 38:16.830
all I can say is what
the remote viewers got.

38:16.960 --> 38:19.670
And from my perspective,

38:19.790 --> 38:22.420
- I think you've got a true anomaly there.
- Wow.

38:22.550 --> 38:26.300
NARRATOR: If what both the field
team and the remote viewers

38:26.420 --> 38:30.300
observed was, in fact,
an extraterrestrial craft,

38:30.430 --> 38:33.520
did it suddenly appear
and then disappear

38:33.640 --> 38:37.640
because it was entering our
world from another dimension?

38:37.770 --> 38:40.810
And do the sketches made
by the remote viewers suggest

38:40.940 --> 38:43.690
that they may have perceived
not only this craft,

38:43.820 --> 38:46.440
but even its occupants?

38:46.570 --> 38:50.780
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes...

38:50.910 --> 38:53.620
and suggest we may be close
to becoming

38:53.740 --> 38:56.580
interdimensional beings
ourselves.

39:02.540 --> 39:04.460
NARRATOR:
The Salyut 7 Space Station.

39:04.590 --> 39:07.970
July 12, 1984.

39:08.090 --> 39:13.050
Soviet cosmonauts Oleg Atkov,
Leonid Kizim,

39:13.180 --> 39:16.640
and Vladimir Solovyov send an
odd and alarming transmission

39:16.770 --> 39:18.180
back to Earth.

39:18.310 --> 39:23.110
They claim that seven enormous
winged humanoid beings,

39:23.230 --> 39:26.860
around 90 feet in height,
and emanating ethereal light,

39:26.990 --> 39:30.200
suddenly appeared
outside the space station.

39:30.320 --> 39:33.780
They remained there
for ten minutes,

39:33.910 --> 39:37.830
and then appeared to fade away.

39:37.950 --> 39:42.210
I think that somewhere
out there, there's a highway.

39:42.330 --> 39:46.460
A highway containing the souls
of millions of aliens

39:46.590 --> 39:50.590
that are traveling
across the galaxy

39:50.720 --> 39:52.510
at the speed of light,

39:52.640 --> 39:55.930
looking at the wonders
of the universe

39:56.060 --> 40:00.270
at the maximum velocity
allowed by Albert Einstein.

40:00.390 --> 40:02.560
And, if it's right next to us,

40:02.690 --> 40:06.480
could we humans detect
this superhighway?

40:06.610 --> 40:08.230
No.

40:08.360 --> 40:12.280
NARRATOR: But if alien
entities are able to cross over

40:12.410 --> 40:14.530
from their universe into ours,

40:14.660 --> 40:17.450
how long will it be
before we discover

40:17.580 --> 40:20.160
how to cross over into theirs?

40:20.290 --> 40:24.750
TZADOK: Right now,
contact between dimensions is limited.

40:24.880 --> 40:28.050
Right now, we are
in exile from one another.

40:28.170 --> 40:31.550
But the future is
to bring the worlds together

40:31.680 --> 40:34.640
so that human consciousness
will exist

40:34.760 --> 40:37.510
in dual dimensions naturally.

40:37.640 --> 40:39.850
The only way we're going
to get there

40:39.970 --> 40:43.770
is if we understand the laws
of physics differently.

40:43.900 --> 40:47.690
Or if we include
new laws of physics

40:47.820 --> 40:51.530
that combine the visible
and the non-visible,

40:51.650 --> 40:54.820
the physical
and the non-physical,

40:54.950 --> 40:58.830
and approach reality
from a multidimensional,

40:58.950 --> 41:01.330
interdimensional perspective.

41:01.450 --> 41:04.080
Not from a linear perspective.

41:04.210 --> 41:07.210
TZADOK:
Everyone will know the truth.

41:07.340 --> 41:09.670
There will be enlightenment
for all.

41:09.800 --> 41:13.800
The unseen will be seen.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.090
♪ ♪

41:16.220 --> 41:18.010
NARRATOR: As scientists
continue to unravel

41:18.140 --> 41:19.930
the secrets of the universe,

41:20.060 --> 41:23.020
will they discover
irrefutable evidence

41:23.140 --> 41:25.020
of a multiverse?

41:25.150 --> 41:27.730
And if so, might this explain

41:27.860 --> 41:30.070
the numerous
paranormal encounters

41:30.190 --> 41:33.070
that humans have reported having
with ghosts,

41:33.190 --> 41:38.200
demons and other
ethereal beings?

41:38.320 --> 41:42.040
Perhaps the notion of aliens
landing on Earth in spaceships

41:42.160 --> 41:43.580
is an old-fashioned one.

41:43.710 --> 41:46.120
And the ability of aliens

41:46.250 --> 41:48.790
to travel from one universe
to another

41:48.920 --> 41:52.010
and communicate with humans
is as limitless

41:52.130 --> 41:54.420
as the capabilities
of our brains.

41:57.300 --> 42:01.100
If true, we will find that our
extraterrestrial neighbors

42:01.220 --> 42:05.440
could be much closer
than we think.
