Previously on The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.800 --> 00:07.247
Whatever's inside that vault,
it wants out,

00:07.480 --> 00:11.280
and you have to promise me,
you won't let Alex set it free.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.447
I promise.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.802
- ALEX: Bonnie, please!
- No one's getting out.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.650
RAYNA: When she wakes,
she'll be just like me.

STEFAN: Do you love him?

00:26.440 --> 00:29.284
I don't know. Can you love someone
and leave them behind,

00:29.480 --> 00:31.289
right when you need each other the most?

00:31.440 --> 00:32.487
I'm still mad at you.

00:32.720 --> 00:35.690
You put me, quite literally, through hell,
and I'm not ready to let that go yet,

00:35.880 --> 00:38.167
but don't think I'm not noticing
all the good you've been doing lately.

00:38.360 --> 00:41.364
ENZO: Bonnie's life is linked
to that of the final Everlasting.

00:41.640 --> 00:44.007
If we sever the link,
it might also sever the curse.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.522
Unfortunately for us,
the Everlasting resides in the Armory.

00:47.720 --> 00:51.122
The evil in the basement escaped from
its vault, and now it could be anywhere.

00:51.360 --> 00:52.691

STEFAN: (OVER PHONE)
You haven't heard from him?

01:08.080 --> 01:10.651
DAMON: Nope. Which means,
to absolutely no one's surprise,

01:10.840 --> 01:14.322
Donovan failed,
and now Bonnie's huntressing in the wild.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.005
All right. But, where is she now?

01:16.160 --> 01:18.561
Coming after one of us, where else?

01:19.480 --> 01:20.766
Weren't you meant to be on a plane?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.162

Where are you?

01:23.360 --> 01:25.203
I'm in solution land, baby.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.085
There's a preserved body at the Armory
called the final Everlasting.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.845
All we have to do is destroy that,

01:30.040 --> 01:32.008
and Bonster is a monster no more.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.726
But if you kill the Everlasting,
Bonnie dies.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.410
And so do we, for that matter.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.726
I've been told differently.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.888
By who, someone that wants you dead?

01:40.120 --> 01:42.248
A descendent of the people
who created Rayna Cruz.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.051
Yeah. The people who hate us.

01:44.200 --> 01:47.044
Well, whether we believe them or not,
it's Bonnie's only chance.

-(GAS HISSING)

01:49.240 --> 01:52.130

01:52.360 --> 01:54.203
Worst-case scenario,

01:54.360 --> 01:58.046
we all die and Stefan lives
to tell the tale of our demise

01:58.240 --> 02:00.402
to the lovely Elena.

02:00.760 --> 02:03.127
Are you forgetting about
the other problem that's in there?

02:03.720 --> 02:06.610
You mean the ambiguously terrifying
monster from the vault?

02:06.800 --> 02:07.881
I'm on it.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.651
Perhaps, once it's less ambiguous,
it will be less terrifying.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.881
Guys, it doesn't matter.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.447
Bonnie sealed the whole Armory.
You can't get in.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.722
Don't tell me what I can't do.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.491
I can't get in.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.644
Plan B. Stefan, call your ex.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.846
Obviously not the one next to you,
Valerie.

02:38.080 --> 02:39.411
She can siphon the seal.

02:40.240 --> 02:43.244
That's great. But, I have absolutely
no idea where to find her.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.010
There is a third option.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.244
And, let me just tell you,
it is just adorable.

02:49.480 --> 02:52.245
The cutest little Plan Cs
you've ever seen.

02:52.480 --> 02:54.767
No. Absolutely not.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.530
All they have to do
is walk up to the door,

02:56.760 --> 02:58.808
and put their tiny little siphon
hands on--

02:59.000 --> 03:00.764
No, my kids are staying out of this,
Damon.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.127
- It's for Bonnie.
- No. It's for us.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.481
So that we don't have to run anymore.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.923
And that is not a good enough excuse
to involve my children in this mess.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.441
You know these scars
that we have link her to us, huh?

03:10.640 --> 03:12.369
She can probably hear
what we're saying right now.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.889
(DISTORTED) She can probably hear
what we're saying right now.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.011
- We'll find Valerie.
- Whatever, bro.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.726
So, what's it like when you see them?

03:29.400 --> 03:33.928
I get snippets of conversations,
some visuals.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.963
But mostly, I can feel them.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

03:37.160 --> 03:38.730
Their emotions.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.929

03:42.800 --> 03:43.881
And they should be.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.289
(STRAINING)
The urges are getting stronger.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.568
I can feel it taking over.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.321
And I don't wanna hurt them.

03:52.520 --> 03:55.490
Then, untie me. Let me help you, okay?
I can stop you.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.126
I know in my heart that I should.

04:01.480 --> 04:02.970
I'm sorry, Matt.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.803
My name's Enzo. Bonnie's friend.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.610
She didn't listen, did she?

04:15.680 --> 04:18.570
After everything I said,
she still opened the vault.

04:18.760 --> 04:19.761
It's complicated.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.361
If that thing is allowed
to get out in the world, we're just--

04:22.560 --> 04:23.846
That's why I'm here.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.368
I need to know exactly
what we're dealing with.

04:26.560 --> 04:27.561
So we can fight it.

04:27.760 --> 04:31.924
You can't fight it. You can't kill it.

for 8:00 in the morning.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.850
Yeah, well, the girls wanted cookies.

05:37.280 --> 05:40.011
The girls had
their friend's birthday party,

05:40.200 --> 05:43.443
and Lizzie took Josie's goodie bag,
I took it back from her,

05:43.640 --> 05:45.642
and then she grabbed my arm.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.562
To get into the Armory.

11:20.760 --> 11:24.003
Lizzie and Josie
could siphon Bonnie's spell.

11:25.240 --> 11:27.811
I said no. Instantly.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.246
Because I thought it was just about me

11:29.440 --> 11:31.681
and Damon and Enzo, and that's fine.
You know?

11:31.920 --> 11:34.002
I'm willing to run,
they're willing to run.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.083
(SIGHS) But then,
I talked to Bonnie on the phone and...

11:39.560 --> 11:41.403
God! She's scared, Ric.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.810
And she's in pain, and...

11:44.760 --> 11:47.127
(SIGHS) But they're your kids.
And I can't make that decision for them.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.687
Well they're not just my kids, Caroline.
They're our kids.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.201
And that's a decision
we need to make together.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.443
She's my best friend.

11:56.560 --> 11:58.005
I don't know what to do.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.725
Look, it's been almost a week

12:04.920 --> 12:07.366
since the girls have been able
to hug their mother. So...

12:10.760 --> 12:13.081
If there's something we can do
to make sure it's not two weeks,

12:13.280 --> 12:14.611
or three,

12:15.280 --> 12:16.361
OF HGVGF...

12:18.280 --> 12:21.489
Just, tell me what it is we need to do.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.965
BONNIE: Matt?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.450
Matt, are you okay?

12:38.920 --> 12:40.001
-(MATT GROANS)
- BONNIE: You okay?

12:41.080 --> 12:42.081
Yeah.

12:42.400 --> 12:43.401
(CONTINUES GROANING)

12:45.240 --> 12:46.685
Just stuck.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.646
How about you? You okay?

12:51.160 --> 12:52.844
Of course I am.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.764
Because if I were dead,
then this would all be over,

12:55.000 --> 12:56.764
and everyone could go back to their lives.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.601
But we're not that lucky.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.649
They'd be dead too, Bonnie.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.087
They're marked. If you die, they die.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.123
So this is just gonna go on forever.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.890
It's okay. I stopped you.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.045
I can keep stopping you.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.125
You're human, Matt.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.523
You don't belong in this fight.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.009
No, no, no. Don't you leave me, Bonnie.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.404
I'm sorry.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.285
MATT: Bonnie!

13:36.680 --> 13:37.966
(GRUNTING)

13:45.440 --> 13:49.365
Hello? I'm hurt, and I need help.
Is anyone out there?

13:56.280 --> 13:57.281

13:57.920 --> 13:58.921

(STRAINING)

14:22.640 --> 14:25.007
(GRUNTING LOUDLY)

14:34.280 --> 14:36.089
STEFAN: You're awfully quiet.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.400
Don't tell me you're still mad
about the pilot.

14:43.240 --> 14:44.890
Caroline's bringing her kids.
We're going to get inside.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.491
And that's all that matters.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.045
What happened to you?

14:55.160 --> 14:58.050
You and I had a breakthrough yesterday.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.321
You pulled a Damon.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.969
You made the right choice.
To hell with the consequences.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.401
We actually agreed, Stefan.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.443
I sent out a press release.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.122
And then you spend one night
with Blonde Ambition

15:10.320 --> 15:13.847
and you're right back to your old,
boring, "choice matters" self.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.121
What the hell, man?

15:15.320 --> 15:16.810
You really think
that I did the right thing

15:17.000 --> 15:18.570
by taking Caroline against her will?

15:19.400 --> 15:20.606
100%.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.326
You said that's how you know
you love someone.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.564
And for a second there,
I actually believed you.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.081
I thought that my love for Caroline
was so strong,

15:29.320 --> 15:31.721
that I would do anything to protect it.

15:31.920 --> 15:36.448
But, then I realized,
that's not love, Damon. That's fear.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.364
You should put that on a greeting card.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.325
That night that you put yourself down,

15:42.040 --> 15:43.451
it wasn't because you loved Elena,

15:43.640 --> 15:44.641
it was because you were afraid

15:44.880 --> 15:47.042
if you didn't,
you would do something terrible.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.289
And you would lose her forever.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.051
And that fear, that fear was so powerful,

15:52.240 --> 15:56.245
that it overrode any love that you felt
for me or Bonnie or anybody else.

15:56.440 --> 15:57.851
It wasn't about you, Stefan.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.849
It had absolutely everything
to do with me.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.690
I looked you in the eyes, Damon.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.564
And I begged you to stay.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.888
And you turned your back on me
like it was nothing.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.328
And I thought about that yesterday,
when I pulled a Damon.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.891
And, I realized,
I never wanna be that person.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.365
I refuse to be ruled by fear.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.245
I refuse to be you.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.206
They're here.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.844
RIC: Do you guys know why we're here?

16:38.520 --> 16:39.885
Because there's something
inside this building

16:40.080 --> 16:41.969
that's really important, that we need.

16:42.760 --> 16:45.047
The only problem is,
these doors are locked.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.846
So, we're gonna need your help
to open them, okay?

16:48.840 --> 16:50.365
CAROLINE: Wanna know something cool?

16:50.760 --> 16:53.286
You two are special.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.767
Because you two are the keys.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.807
Let's play a game.
Everyone put one hand on the door.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.924
Remember Amy's birthday party?

17:08.240 --> 17:10.810
I took away your goodie bag
and what happened?

17:11.359 --> 17:12.885
I hurt you.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.970
Yes. Because I took something from you.

17:17.839 --> 17:20.366
Now, how would you feel

17:20.599 --> 17:23.604
if someone tried to take me away from you?

17:23.800 --> 17:25.882
- Mad.
- Sad.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.525
Yeah, me too.

17:28.720 --> 17:32.964
And if we don't get inside of here,
that might happen.

17:33.960 --> 17:37.601
I might never be able to see you,

17:37.800 --> 17:42.089
or hug you, or tuck you in at night.

17:49.800 --> 17:50.847
It's working.

17:51.560 --> 17:52.607
Keep going, girls.

18:02.760 --> 18:03.841
(BOTH PANT)

18:04.440 --> 18:06.761
- CAROLINE: Good job.
- Good job, you two. (GRUNTS)

18:06.960 --> 18:09.566
- You did so good.
- You both did such a good job.

18:09.760 --> 18:11.842
It's all over.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.443
- Calling to apologize for my leg?
-(CHUCKLES)

18:19.400 --> 18:21.402
I know what you're planning.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.046
(CHUCKLES) I can see everyone
waiting at the Armory.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.368
They're sitting ducks, Enzo.

18:26.560 --> 18:29.769
Except not everyone is waiting
at the Armory.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.048
- What're you doing?
- My part.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.850
I need a favor from you.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.327
- I need you to think about me.
- No.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.568
I'm going to pretend
that doesn't hurt my feelings.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.290
Look, I know your urges are strong.

18:42.480 --> 18:46.041
And I know you can't control them.
But you can focus them.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.962
Chase me, and only me.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.970
And it'll give our friends some time
to sort all this out.

18:52.440 --> 18:53.726
I'll catch you, Enzo.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.046
Give me some credit.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.964
Come on, love.

18:58.160 --> 19:00.242
I'll lead you
on a little wild goose chase.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.728
Okay. I see you.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.491
Now, come and get me.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.370
DAMON: Where are the little squirts?

19:22.480 --> 19:24.369
(SIGHS) Away from whatever's gonna come
out of there.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.843
Well, for something to get out,
we have to be able to get in.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.163
Nice. Shall we?

19:39.080 --> 19:40.684
Stefan.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.531
Whatever you're about to say, just...

19:44.800 --> 19:46.564
Say it when this is over.

20:00.560 --> 20:05.441
Well. This looks... Promising.

20:05.960 --> 20:06.961
Meh.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.962
I've seen worse.

20:19.080 --> 20:23.961
So, this thing that was in the vault
that no one was supposed to open,

20:24.200 --> 20:26.248
do we know what it is?

20:26.440 --> 20:28.807
Yep. Bad.

20:30.120 --> 20:33.249
Enzo said the final Everlasting
is in a coffin somewhere.

20:33.680 --> 20:37.002
So, let's just find this thing
and get the hell out of here.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.481
(ENZO BLOWS)

20:51.280 --> 20:52.327
Why did you stop?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.764
I was running out of gas,

20:54.960 --> 20:57.008
which means you were gonna
catch up to me eventually.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.364
I cannot begin to know
what you're feeling.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.808
- But, I thought, if you came here...
- Enzo.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.847
Maybe we could share a meal and a drink,
one last time.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.244
You know I can't do that.

21:23.040 --> 21:26.362
(SIGHS) Come on.
My risotto isn't that bad.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.688
I'm so sorry.

21:30.880 --> 21:31.881

-(GRUNTS)

21:36.040 --> 21:38.008
This is appropriately creepy.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.881
Enzo said, "Don't go into the vault."

21:41.320 --> 21:43.129
Huh. Well, we've searched everywhere else.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.681
You know, if you're scared, Damon,

21:44.880 --> 21:48.885
you can go wait outside
with the 3-year-olds.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.244
Damon.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.244
You ready to do this or what?

22:02.880 --> 22:04.484
Yeah.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.124
Yes, lam.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.645
But I'm gonna do it alone.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.041
Like hell you are.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.651
Whatever's down there is no bueno.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.285
Which is why you need me.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.329
Let me do this, Stefan.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.722
There is a girl waiting outside for you,

22:19.920 --> 22:21.684
and if you go in there with me,
and get all screwed up,

22:21.880 --> 22:23.769
you're gonna have problems with her,
and you're gonna blame me.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.281
I don't care. I can help you.

22:26.520 --> 22:27.931
I know you can.

22:29.280 --> 22:30.725
And you have.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.640
Over and over again.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.361
You've helped me.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.729
And over and over again, it's screwed you.
And this--

22:36.920 --> 22:39.810
So, this time,
I need a different kind of help, okay?

22:41.440 --> 22:45.650
I need you to let me go.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.643
Let me succeed, or let me fail.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.722
But, let me do it by myself.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.487
I'm sorry I walked out on you that night.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.964
You're right, I was scared.

23:04.480 --> 23:07.962
And I knew you'd be mad,
but I also knew that you'd be okay.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.288
I know my choices suck sometimes,

23:12.480 --> 23:14.528
and you like to be there
to head 'em off at the pass,

23:14.720 --> 23:19.886
but this time,
I need you to believe in me.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.051
Okay?

23:24.960 --> 23:27.042
Damon, I--

23:27.240 --> 23:29.163
You don't want a life ruled by fear?

23:29.400 --> 23:30.401
Huh?

23:31.120 --> 23:36.684
Then, this time, you walk out on me.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.280
And don't be afraid of what'll happen.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.724
Trust I'll be okay,

23:46.520 --> 23:47.806
one way or another.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.485
I'll be okay.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.131
Yeah.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.201
Okay.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.640
Listen, if you need me, I'll be--

24:14.840 --> 24:16.365
Right outside.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.241
Yep.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.682

It's okay. No, it's okay.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.210
But I need one thing from you.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.291
When this is over,
don't remember this moment.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.130
Remember the other ones.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.841
New Year's Eve and champagne.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.850
Your terrible, terrible guitar playing
that never really got any better

27:03.040 --> 27:04.246
even though I said it did.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.481

27:07.080 --> 27:08.081
(BOTH GRUNTING)

27:09.880 --> 27:11.166
(PANTING) And remember...

27:11.720 --> 27:14.883
I had over a century of pain
and loneliness,

27:16.640 --> 27:17.766
before I found you.

27:20.480 --> 27:24.769
And then three glorious years of love.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.121
(BONNIE SOBS)

27:30.440 --> 27:32.249
Bonnie, I love you.

27:33.560 --> 27:36.166
(SOFTLY) I love you, Enzo.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.770
There you are.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.923
I can't hold back anymore.

27:51.240 --> 27:52.844
You don't have to.

27:54.920 --> 27:55.921
(GRUNTS)

28:10.920 --> 28:11.967
(GRUNTING)

28:16.760 --> 28:18.091
Come... On.

28:22.880 --> 28:23.881
Come on!

28:31.480 --> 28:32.481
(PANTING)

28:35.800 --> 28:37.370
He did it.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.284
He did it! He did it!

29:07.200 --> 29:08.326
No more scar.

29:09.560 --> 29:11.847
Yeah. I guess he did it.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.125
I'm gonna take the kids home.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.845
Good. And, I'll get my stuff.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.371
No.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.924
No, you should...

29:23.040 --> 29:24.087
You should stay.

29:27.680 --> 29:31.127
You changed my life. You know that, right?

29:31.320 --> 29:33.607
I mean, you completely turned it around.

29:35.800 --> 29:37.962
And for that I...

29:40.040 --> 29:41.166
I will always love you,

29:43.400 --> 29:46.404
even though I know
you don't love me the same way.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.090
- Ric.
- It's okay.

29:49.360 --> 29:52.091
I mean, to be honest, I always knew.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.806
It's just that, you know, we...

29:56.000 --> 30:02.042
We had these moments
where we were just perfectly in sync.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.246
- Laughing at the kids or...
-(SNIFFS)

30:05.840 --> 30:08.730
In tears because we were so exhausted,
that I...

30:10.800 --> 30:12.165
lguess“.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.411
No, I guess a part of me thought that

30:14.600 --> 30:19.242
maybe one day those moments
might become something more.

30:21.680 --> 30:24.126
But that wouldn't be fair to you and...

30:25.480 --> 30:27.721
It certainly wouldn't be fair
to me, either.

30:28.440 --> 30:29.930
(SIGHS) I'm so sorry.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.326
No.

30:31.520 --> 30:37.607
A part of me just loved the idea
of a perfect, happy family.

30:37.880 --> 30:38.881
(CHUCKLES)

30:39.680 --> 30:42.081
And I didn't wanna let that go.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.363
You should be happy.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.161
I mean, you deserve everything you want.

30:52.400 --> 30:56.086
And, no matter what happens, Caroline,

30:57.120 --> 31:01.409
you, me, the kids, we're a family.

31:03.760 --> 31:08.129
And we will always, always be a family.

31:35.920 --> 31:38.287
This is quite the mess, isn't it?

31:39.600 --> 31:41.443
(WEAKLY) Penny.

31:46.080 --> 31:47.605
This isn't real.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.490
Really?

31:49.720 --> 31:50.926
As screwed up as your life is,

31:51.120 --> 31:53.964
you're not even gonna consider
that I could be a ghost?

31:56.800 --> 31:58.245
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to--

31:58.440 --> 32:00.966
No, no. I know.

32:02.560 --> 32:06.884
You're a terrible shot.
We established that years ago.

32:07.320 --> 32:08.321
(CHUCKLES)

32:13.200 --> 32:15.487
How the hell did you get yourself
into this one?

32:17.520 --> 32:19.727
I just can't escape this life.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.650
That's the thing, Matt.

32:24.920 --> 32:26.684
You haven't really tried.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.049
So, what do you wanna do?

32:37.080 --> 32:39.447
I just wanna be with you.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.523
Please, take me with you.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.370
Sorry, Matt.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.169
You don't belong with me either.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.371
There's a better life for you out there.

33:09.360 --> 33:11.522
You just have to wake up and find it.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.331
Wake up.

33:16.720 --> 33:17.721
Wake up!

You lost a lot of blood,
but it's gonna be okay.

Just stay with me.
Everything's gonna be okay.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.211
CAROLINE: He's Damon.

33:38.440 --> 33:42.411
He's like a cockroach. He always survives.

33:43.520 --> 33:44.885
You're still here.

33:46.160 --> 33:48.049
I still had some things
I wanted to say to you

33:48.240 --> 33:49.401
when this was over.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.481
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

34:01.320 --> 34:02.924
He's okay.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.205
He always is.

34:14.400 --> 34:18.563
So, um, I guess
whatever you wanted to say to me,

34:18.760 --> 34:21.922
you can say it now.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.645
I lied earlier.

34:33.719 --> 34:35.529
There was a thaw.

If you think this means you're forgiven...

35:20.480 --> 35:22.448
I am so forgiven.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.485
You're kind of forgiven.

35:25.760 --> 35:27.091
Uh, would it have killed you
to have done it,

35:27.360 --> 35:29.124
I don't know, five minutes sooner?

35:29.320 --> 35:31.721
Wait. Enzo's still alive?

35:31.920 --> 35:33.809
Damn, I thought I waited long enough.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.287
Thank you.

35:37.640 --> 35:42.043
Thank me in person, with gifts. And--

- Hang on.

Elena?

35:53.240 --> 35:54.321
What did you just say?

35:54.520 --> 35:56.409
I can hear her in the vault.

35:57.320 --> 36:01.450
Damon,
Elena is in a warehouse in Brooklyn.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.160
I know, but...

36:08.880 --> 36:10.120
ELENA: Damon.

36:10.320 --> 36:12.687
- What if something happened to her?
- ELENA: Help me.

36:12.880 --> 36:15.167
- What if the Armory took her?
- They didn't.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.686
ELENA: Please.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.041
I just need to make sure.

36:19.200 --> 36:20.770
Damon. Get out of there.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.891
ELENA: Please, help me.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.086
I'm so alone.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.521
I need you.

- The vault.

But he closed the security door.

So,openit

36:58.120 --> 37:00.441
No, we can't.
Only someone from the Armory can.

37:00.640 --> 37:01.721
Why didn't you bring Enzo?

37:01.920 --> 37:03.331
I did.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.084
Didn't feel like playing
scissors, paper, stone

37:55.280 --> 37:56.611
over who was gonna save your life.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.284
That's very heroic of you.

37:59.480 --> 38:02.882
I don't leave people behind. Not my style.

38:03.080 --> 38:06.607
Plus, my girl seems to think
that you're her best friend.

38:06.840 --> 38:11.368
(CHUCKLES) And, from what I can tell,
heroes always do right by their girl.

38:11.840 --> 38:14.161
Then I should warn you,

38:14.360 --> 38:17.443
it doesn't always work out so great.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.206
Had a feeling.

38:21.440 --> 38:23.010
But don't worry.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.882
It's not as bad as you think.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.364
It only hurts at first.

38:34.200 --> 38:35.201

Stefan and I
had finally worked through our problems.

38:57.040 --> 38:59.281
Bonnie and Enzo were on the verge
of being happy.

38:59.520 --> 39:02.808
And Damon,
Damon actually did the right thing,

39:03.000 --> 39:04.843
the selfless thing.

39:05.480 --> 39:07.642
(SIGHS) We waited in that room for days.

Stefan didn't sleep.

39:20.320 --> 39:23.085
After a week,
Alaric managed to crack the security code.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.447
We were prepared for almost anything.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.204
Except what we saw.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.371
It was empty.

39:32.760 --> 39:33.727
Enzo?

39:33.920 --> 39:36.048
CAROLINE: Completely cleaned out.

39:36.240 --> 39:38.561
I don't know how they got out,
but they did.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.250
Enzo?

39:40.920 --> 39:43.287
CAROLINE: I'm worried about Bonnie.

39:43.520 --> 39:45.966
She lost the two people closest to her,

39:46.160 --> 39:49.084
and she can't even do a Iocator spell
to find them.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.721
Her magic never came back.
She feels helpless.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.767
MATT: I reached out to all my contacts

40:00.000 --> 40:02.128
knowing they'd show up sooner or later.

40:02.320 --> 40:03.481
I owed them that much.

40:05.680 --> 40:09.446
But then I left, because,
as sad as it is, this isn't my fight.

40:11.320 --> 40:15.211
And if I'm ever going to be happy,
I have to recognize which ones are.

40:20.320 --> 40:23.051
STEFAN: It was three months
before we heard the first rumor.

40:25.040 --> 40:27.327
A string of missing persons
on the west coast.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.563
It was encouraging.

40:30.760 --> 40:32.649
But then the numbers kept growing.

40:34.520 --> 40:39.321
Twenty. Fifty. Sixty people missing.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.171
It's them. I know it.

40:44.680 --> 40:49.971
I don't know what's wrong with them,
or what they're doing, or why,

40:50.160 --> 40:53.323
but I promise you, we'll get them back.

40:56.160 --> 40:59.448
Just know that whatever happens
between now and then,

41:02.320 --> 41:03.890
it's not his fault.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.001
There you are.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.850
Aw! Did you miss me?

41:39.960 --> 41:42.042
It never gets old, does it?

41:43.440 --> 41:45.920
Well, it sure as hell hasn't yet.
