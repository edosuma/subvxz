How the hell would I know that?
Just reset it.

01:36.704 --> 01:39.442
Yeah, what the hell you think
I've been trying to do, man?

01:39.509 --> 01:42.481
It just keeps saying go
into my old email or something.

01:42.549 --> 01:44.886
Which email?

01:44.953 --> 01:46.991
AIM?

01:47.057 --> 01:48.628
As in AOL?

Oh, that's what that is.
Yeah, nigga, that one.

01:53.136 --> 01:54.606

01:54.673 --> 01:58.246

Favorite movie...

02:00.818 --> 02:02.187
Scarface?

02:02.254 --> 02:03.758
Scarface, right?
Like, that's got to be it, man.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.662
-Hold on. Let me try that.
-No.

02:05.728 --> 02:07.499
Man, it was in middle school.
Try Mulan.

Nigga. Mulan.

02:10.137 --> 02:11.774
Oh, shit.
I think that worked.

Yeah.

I'll talk to you later.

Probation, Princeton.

Right.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.842

-Hmm.

03:43.356 --> 03:46.229
(sighs)

03:46.295 --> 03:47.866
Earn, I know it can be hard
to disconnect,

03:47.932 --> 03:50.303
but we can't have
productive sessions

03:50.370 --> 03:52.575
with your cellphone on, Earn.

03:52.642 --> 03:56.115
It's important. I can't pay
for this if I don't do this.

03:56.182 --> 03:58.687
You seem... frustrated.

03:58.754 --> 04:02.094
I am. I'm having heart troubles,
and my doctor is telling me

04:02.161 --> 04:04.298
I need to get my head checked.

04:04.365 --> 04:06.537
That sounds serious.

04:06.603 --> 04:10.978
I hope I can help, but to do so,
we can't have distractions.

04:21.700 --> 04:24.773
So, what did your doctor say?

04:25.541 --> 04:27.044
I have a tightness in my chest

04:27.111 --> 04:30.450
and a pain, numbness
going down my left arm.

04:30.518 --> 04:33.289
They say I'm healthy.
They think I'm lying.

04:34.058 --> 04:36.028
Do you have reason to think
they don't believe you?

04:36.095 --> 04:38.601
If they did it to Kim Porter,
they'll do it to me.

04:38.667 --> 04:41.740
I had to get a second opinion.
They got me

04:41.807 --> 04:45.213
walking around like Alita:
Battle Angel all weekend.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.652
Whoa! EKG machine.

04:47.719 --> 04:48.787
Yeah.

04:48.854 --> 04:51.125
-What's their guess?
-Depression,

04:51.192 --> 04:53.263
panic attacks, anxiety.

04:53.329 --> 04:54.966
-You know, a smattering.
-Hmm.

04:55.033 --> 04:58.173
Well, I mean, panic and anxiety
can manifest in many forms.

04:58.239 --> 05:01.012
You should listen to your body.
It's smarter than you think.

05:01.078 --> 05:02.816
Yeah, but anxiety about what?

05:02.882 --> 05:05.521
You know, my life is good.
It's not a flex,

05:05.588 --> 05:07.725
like, work is really good.

05:07.792 --> 05:09.896
I'm making more money
than I've ever made.

05:09.963 --> 05:12.201
You know, the agency
keeps giving me more clients.

05:12.267 --> 05:14.205
-I mean, it's great.
-Good.

05:14.271 --> 05:15.775
How are things at home?

Good. Fine.

05:21.118 --> 05:25.628
Uh, I'm redecorating the condo,
so...

05:25.695 --> 05:28.099
Which honestly
doesn't make much sense

05:28.166 --> 05:29.736
if I'm moving out of state.

05:29.803 --> 05:32.241
Wow.
That's a really big decision.

05:32.307 --> 05:35.313
What... what changed?

05:35.380 --> 05:38.721
Uh... I got a job offer in L. A.

05:38.787 --> 05:42.094
-Creative consulting.
-Mm.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.566
Yeah, it's, um...

05:44.633 --> 05:47.404
It's a big deal, I guess. I...

05:47.471 --> 05:49.543
I haven't told Van yet.

05:49.609 --> 05:52.014
Are you worried
about the distance

05:52.080 --> 05:53.851
between you and Lottie

05:53.918 --> 05:56.255
if you take this job
and Van doesn't want to go?

05:56.322 --> 05:58.661
(clock ticking)

06:00.498 --> 06:02.735
(sighs)

06:04.906 --> 06:06.475
Yeah. Yeah.

06:06.543 --> 06:08.781
If I'm being honest,

06:08.847 --> 06:11.720
I think Lottie needs me more
now than ever, you know?

06:11.787 --> 06:14.425
Um...

06:14.492 --> 06:17.331
can I... can I lay down?

06:17.397 --> 06:19.201
Please, yeah. Yeah.

06:19.268 --> 06:20.571
Just don't fall asleep on me.

07:39.963 --> 07:42.167
Yeah. Please, please. So, uh,

07:42.234 --> 07:44.939
tell me, uh, you, uh...
you signed to anyone yet?

07:45.006 --> 07:48.046
Like a-a book agent? I wish.
(chuckles)

07:48.112 --> 07:52.287
Um, I could use your advice
on that.

07:52.354 --> 07:55.561
Uh, you are the first person
who has reached out to...

07:55.628 --> 07:57.899
Oh, no, no.
First rule of negotiations--

07:57.965 --> 08:00.070
never admit
that you're not that wanted.

08:00.136 --> 08:02.675
I'll keep this brief.
Uh, I found a sample

08:02.742 --> 08:03.977
of your kids' book online,

08:04.044 --> 08:05.514
and I'd love
to find you a publisher.

Oh, uh...

08:10.390 --> 08:12.227
my whole life. (chuckles)

-Mm?

08:13.630 --> 08:15.200
Your 10:30, man.

08:15.266 --> 08:16.570
Oh. Uh, thank you. Thank you.

08:16.636 --> 08:18.473
Uh, so, uh,
do you have any drawings

08:18.540 --> 08:19.909
to go along with your book?

08:19.976 --> 08:22.548
Uh, no, sir, not yet.
Is that a problem?

08:22.615 --> 08:24.919
Ah, Lis, kids need things
to look at, all right?

08:24.986 --> 08:27.124
I-I got you covered. I-I know
a few, uh, illustrators

08:27.190 --> 08:29.328
at SCAD you can commission,
but time is of the essence.

08:29.395 --> 08:30.698
Deadline is end of week.

08:30.765 --> 08:32.034
Yeah, I don't think
that I could aff...

08:32.100 --> 08:34.138
-Deadline?
-Well, yeah. Yeah, it's a...

08:34.204 --> 08:35.875
It's a seller's market.
End of the quarter.

08:35.941 --> 08:37.377
Publishers are offloading
their budget.

08:37.444 --> 08:38.714
-Now, Tracy has a...
-TRACY: Huh?

08:38.781 --> 08:40.316
I didn't call you.

08:40.383 --> 08:42.487
Tracy has arranged
for a sort of story time reading

08:42.555 --> 08:43.924
at the local library already.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.795
It's, uh...
They're mostly inner-city kids.

08:45.861 --> 08:48.600
I've arranged for a publishing
legend to scout you there.

08:48.667 --> 08:51.072
Now you can't miss her.
Just look for the hat.

08:51.138 --> 08:54.813
Uh, wait. Um, do you think
that I could get signed?

08:54.879 --> 08:56.382
Signed? Kid,
that story of yours could be

08:56.449 --> 08:58.186
the biggest payday
since The Berenstein Bears.

08:58.252 --> 09:00.524
-Or Berenstain. Or-- You get it.
-No, I get it.

09:00.591 --> 09:03.530
Yeah. Oh, uh, uh, don't screw
this up for the rest of us.

09:03.597 --> 09:05.233
All right?
And congratulations. I accept.

09:05.300 --> 09:07.872
-Uh, accept what?
-To be your book agent.

09:07.939 --> 09:09.609
Here's my card.
Call me if you need anything.

09:09.676 --> 09:11.212
-(gasps)
-Oh.

09:11.278 --> 09:12.815
And there's a hair place
at the mall-- Talia's.

09:12.882 --> 09:14.218
They can do something
about those grays.

09:14.284 --> 09:15.721

and what they've rationalized.

09:38.366 --> 09:41.439
So... no one.

09:41.506 --> 09:44.144
Yeah. Maybe Darius.

09:45.781 --> 09:47.317

Oh, uh, new keyboard.

09:50.925 --> 09:52.595
You know, it's, uh, safer.

09:52.662 --> 09:55.133
Oh. You play?

09:55.200 --> 09:58.406
Yeah, I've been known to get a
little busy on the keys. Mm-hmm.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.410
-Little bit.
-(chuckles)

10:00.477 --> 10:02.214
Could you play me something?

10:02.280 --> 10:04.151
-Maybe later.
-Ah.

10:04.218 --> 10:08.025
So, uh, tell me about,
uh, Princeton.

10:08.092 --> 10:10.230
Did you accept their invitation
to speak?

10:10.296 --> 10:11.900
(chuckles)
No. No.

10:11.967 --> 10:13.804
I told them to give me an
honorary degree or kiss my ass.

10:13.871 --> 10:16.710
Mm. And what'd they say?

10:16.776 --> 10:19.181
They said "yes"...
to the degree, not my ass.

10:19.248 --> 10:21.586
(chuckles)
That's a hell of a negotiation.

10:21.653 --> 10:23.489
Yeah.

10:23.557 --> 10:24.826
Yeah, not-not really.

10:24.893 --> 10:26.262
I mean,
it's-it's a pretend degree.

10:26.328 --> 10:28.232
I can't start
a medical practice with it.

10:28.299 --> 10:29.903
In the end,
I'm making more money

10:29.969 --> 10:31.740
than if I had stayed, so...

10:31.807 --> 10:33.610
You proud of that?

10:33.677 --> 10:36.348
Yeah. Fuck that school.

10:36.415 --> 10:38.954
Sounds like you resent them.

10:40.658 --> 10:42.160
(stammers)

10:42.227 --> 10:44.131
They're only after me now
because of two reasons.

10:44.198 --> 10:45.701
One, because being Black
is valuable,

10:45.768 --> 10:47.470
and two, donations.

10:47.538 --> 10:49.241
Mm, right.

10:50.009 --> 10:51.880
You know,
you've-you've alluded to it,

10:51.947 --> 10:54.351
but what exactly happened
to you at Princeton?

10:57.692 --> 10:59.963
Me and this girl named Sasha--

11:00.029 --> 11:03.469
we were new RAs
in the same building, right?

11:03.537 --> 11:07.344
And we got close really fast,

11:07.410 --> 11:11.085
and I felt like I could
be honest with her, right?

11:11.151 --> 11:12.588
You know, we're new friends,
but good friends.

11:12.655 --> 11:16.028
Anyway,
I get this job interview,

11:16.095 --> 11:18.032
and I'm really excited
about it, you know.

11:18.099 --> 11:19.936
I call my parents,
I get a little money from them,

11:20.003 --> 11:21.438
and I scrounge up
a little money.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.810
I buy a suit, 'cause I need
to look presentable.

11:23.877 --> 11:26.215
I go buy the suit,
then I go to the computer lab.

11:26.282 --> 11:28.386
What did you get?
What kind of suit?

11:28.452 --> 11:32.828
Navy blue slacks
and blazer with leather loafers.

11:32.895 --> 11:34.264
Okay, so you were stylin'.

11:34.331 --> 11:36.468
I was stylin'.
It was, like, super nice.

11:36.536 --> 11:38.206
I looked good, right? (chuckles)

11:38.272 --> 11:41.646
So, I'm at the computer lab,
and my crush comes in.

11:41.713 --> 11:43.049
And she asked me
if I want to go

11:43.115 --> 11:44.484
to this party
in Philly with her.

11:44.552 --> 11:47.592
She wants me to go,
and I'm like, "Cool."

11:47.658 --> 11:49.361
Sasha is a couple
of stalls down.

11:49.428 --> 11:52.267
She hears this
and offers to take my suit,

11:52.334 --> 11:55.240
stash it in her room, and I can
just go straight from there.

11:55.306 --> 11:57.511
I'm like, "Cool. Thank you."
You know?

11:57.578 --> 11:59.448
I go to the party,

11:59.515 --> 12:03.289
I come back,
I text her to get the suit.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.163
No response.

12:07.230 --> 12:09.836
I text her again. No response.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.842
I text her a third time.
Same thing.

12:12.909 --> 12:14.478
Did something happen?

12:14.545 --> 12:17.752
I don't think so.
It was like she was ducking me.

12:17.818 --> 12:19.822
So, it's hours
before the interview...

12:19.889 --> 12:21.358
-Right.
-...and I'm freaking out.

12:21.425 --> 12:22.695
So I'm texting her again.

12:22.762 --> 12:24.031
I'm like,
"Hey, where's the suit?

12:24.097 --> 12:25.701
I really need the suit."

12:25.768 --> 12:28.339
And she just writes back...

12:28.406 --> 12:30.611
"Sorry. Not around."

12:30.678 --> 12:32.682
Hmm.

12:32.748 --> 12:34.384
So what did you do?

12:34.451 --> 12:37.692
Man, I went downstairs,
I knocked on her door.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.161
No one picked up.

12:39.227 --> 12:42.868
You know, so I went in there
with my master key,

12:42.935 --> 12:45.273
and I got my suit, and I left.

12:46.643 --> 12:48.479
Big mistake.

12:48.547 --> 12:52.888
(sighs)
She was, like, furious. Like...

12:54.525 --> 12:56.362
She told the dean,

12:56.428 --> 12:58.767
and it became, like,
a real thing.

12:58.834 --> 13:01.305
He's coming back, saying like,
"Oh, this is a suspension."

13:01.372 --> 13:03.009
And then it turns
into expulsion.

13:03.075 --> 13:04.579
So I'm guessing
Sasha wasn't Black.

13:04.646 --> 13:05.914
No.

13:05.981 --> 13:07.551
-Of course not.
-Yeah.

13:07.618 --> 13:09.756
They started using
rapist language for what I did.

13:09.822 --> 13:11.325
Rapist language?

13:11.392 --> 13:14.431
"Intruder," "personal assault,"
"attack on privacy."

13:14.499 --> 13:16.268
Like, I was scared.

13:16.335 --> 13:20.476
You know, I apologized, but it
was like no one was listening.

13:20.544 --> 13:21.913
It's like no one cared.

13:21.980 --> 13:23.650
What do you think
their perception was?

13:23.717 --> 13:26.790
That this big black gorilla came
into this white girl's room

13:26.856 --> 13:30.698
and just destroyed shit.
I don't know.

13:30.764 --> 13:32.300
Uh, you know, as an RA,

13:32.367 --> 13:34.137
they make you feel like
you have some sort of agency.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.541
But then you turn around,

13:35.607 --> 13:37.110
and then, all of a sudden,
you're O. J.

13:37.177 --> 13:38.980
It's, like,
why give me the master key

13:39.047 --> 13:40.383
if you didn't trust me
to use it?

13:40.450 --> 13:42.120
-How'd that make you feel?
-Angry.

13:42.187 --> 13:43.957
Everybody on campus
is talking about me.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.661
I'm, like,
one of 12 Black kids.

13:45.728 --> 13:47.430
You know, I already felt alone.

13:47.498 --> 13:50.136
What else did you feel?

13:50.203 --> 13:51.940
(exhales)

13:52.007 --> 13:54.444
-Hurt, I guess.
-Why? Why?

13:56.950 --> 13:59.555
Because we were supposed
to be friends.

14:00.858 --> 14:02.962
We were supposed to be friends.

14:03.029 --> 14:05.667
She never even asked why.

14:05.734 --> 14:07.805
Why I did what I did.

14:07.872 --> 14:10.309
-You trusted Sasha.
-Yeah.

14:11.178 --> 14:13.482
And you were hurt
by someone you trusted.

14:14.786 --> 14:16.523
Yeah.

14:16.589 --> 14:19.027
Like the family member
who abused you.

14:21.866 --> 14:23.804
Yeah.

14:23.870 --> 14:26.275
Which made you feel powerless
again.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.629
(inhales sharply)

14:36.696 --> 14:39.267
(exhales sharply)

14:41.706 --> 14:43.643
It's cool.

14:43.710 --> 14:46.048
You should release this.

14:47.752 --> 14:49.020
-No. I'm good. I'm good.
-Hey.

14:49.087 --> 14:51.458
No, I'm-I'm good.

15:01.278 --> 15:03.550
So what happened
between you two?

15:07.457 --> 15:10.564
We never talked again.
You know, I had to leave.

15:12.133 --> 15:15.006
I just promised...

15:15.072 --> 15:17.343
I'd just prove everybody wrong.

15:18.713 --> 15:20.884
Did you prove everyone wrong?

15:20.951 --> 15:23.088
Yeah.

15:23.155 --> 15:25.561
(sniffles)
I love spite.

15:25.627 --> 15:27.163
(Tillman chuckles)

15:27.230 --> 15:31.171
-It's a pure, powerful thing.
-Hmm.

15:32.942 --> 15:35.213
It gave me courage.

15:36.081 --> 15:38.052
You know, I can count on it.

15:38.119 --> 15:41.391
I used it when I came back
to Atlanta, you know?

15:44.632 --> 15:47.036
Spite can be...

15:50.076 --> 15:52.413
Spite can be very powerful.

15:53.215 --> 15:55.687
But it can also leave you...

15:55.754 --> 15:58.392
depressed and empty.

15:59.829 --> 16:01.766
Goals stop becoming yours.

16:01.833 --> 16:03.770
You start becoming a...

16:03.837 --> 16:06.509
a book written
by somebody else.

16:06.576 --> 16:09.749
Someone with no incentive
for your well-being.

16:09.816 --> 16:11.986
(sniffles)

16:12.053 --> 16:14.492
So by not going back
to Princeton,

16:14.559 --> 16:17.263
you may be proving something
to her and not yourself.

16:19.669 --> 16:21.739
Yeah, maybe.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.077
(clock ticking)

16:27.551 --> 16:29.755
(sniffles)

16:33.128 --> 16:35.366
(both laughing)

16:35.433 --> 16:38.640
I'm sorry,
but what were you thinking?

16:38.707 --> 16:43.115
I was thinking that I was going
to meet Outkast and get married.

16:43.182 --> 16:44.484
(both laugh)

16:44.552 --> 16:47.223
Which is completely reasonable.

16:47.290 --> 16:50.664
(both laughing)

16:50.731 --> 16:53.770
But why are you smiling
so much lately?

16:53.837 --> 16:56.408
(humming)

16:57.176 --> 16:58.847
Are you getting laid?

16:58.914 --> 17:00.918
No.

17:00.984 --> 17:03.557
It's better than that.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.627
Whoa. Ah.

17:05.694 --> 17:07.297
Spill it.

17:08.867 --> 17:09.869
I quit my job.

17:09.936 --> 17:11.471
(snorts softly)

17:11.539 --> 17:13.543
Whoa. Wait.

17:13.610 --> 17:14.879
Why?

17:14.946 --> 17:18.620
An agent read my book online
and wants to sign me.

17:18.687 --> 17:21.826
I just have
to do this reading thing.

17:21.893 --> 17:24.765
I mean, he thinks it could be,
like, the next Harry Potter.

17:24.832 --> 17:26.134
-(gasps)
-(laughs)

17:26.201 --> 17:28.138
-Wow. That's great.
-(laughs)

17:28.205 --> 17:29.675
What? What is it?

17:29.742 --> 17:33.750
-(chuckles softly)
-Nothing. Nuh... nuh...

17:33.817 --> 17:35.219
You've quit your job.

17:35.286 --> 17:37.725
Yeah, I had to quit my job
because I have

17:37.791 --> 17:39.495
to just really focus

17:39.562 --> 17:41.833
on hiring an illustrator,
a PR firm.

17:41.900 --> 17:42.868
I need a stylist.

17:42.935 --> 17:44.872
I mean, if this thing takes off,

17:44.939 --> 17:48.012
it could be huge,
like, franchised.

17:48.078 --> 17:50.016
-(chuckles softly)
-It is so lucrative.

17:50.082 --> 17:52.554
Don't you think?

17:52.621 --> 17:55.727
Yeah, sure, but it-it doesn't
really matter what I think.

17:55.794 --> 17:57.463
Yes, it does.
You're my best friend.

17:57.531 --> 17:59.702
♪♪ Ground to start from... ♪♪

17:59.769 --> 18:01.438
(chuckles)
God.

18:01.506 --> 18:05.112
Look, Lisa, you have my support.

18:05.179 --> 18:07.283
You have my support.

18:07.350 --> 18:09.154
♪♪ You'll say the world... ♪♪

18:09.220 --> 18:10.757
I just, um...

18:10.824 --> 18:15.166
I can't loan you another $500
this... this month.

18:15.232 --> 18:17.504
I've got a lot of bills,
and I...

18:17.571 --> 18:20.510
Look, I'm just worried
about you.

18:22.380 --> 18:24.885
Tell me you like my writing.

18:24.952 --> 18:27.323
Lisa...

18:28.359 --> 18:30.631
(sighs softly)

18:40.951 --> 18:42.186
Sorry I'm late.

18:42.253 --> 18:44.157
TILLMAN:
No. How you doing, Earn?

18:44.224 --> 18:47.397
Good. (grunts)

18:47.463 --> 18:50.069
Oh, another box.
You starting a band?

18:50.136 --> 18:52.708
(chuckles)
Not quite. It's a gift.

18:52.775 --> 18:54.512
Go ahead and open it.

18:55.313 --> 18:58.452
-You serious?
-I'm serious.

18:58.520 --> 19:01.058
Man, I hate opening gifts
in public.

19:01.124 --> 19:03.697
I mean, what if it sucks?

19:08.807 --> 19:10.276
It's a floor pillow.

19:10.343 --> 19:12.614
I mean, you spend so much time
laying on the floor, I figured,

19:12.681 --> 19:14.952
you know, might as well be
comfortable, right?

19:15.019 --> 19:16.288
That's really thoughtful.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.392
Try it out.

19:18.459 --> 19:20.731
(grunts softly)

19:22.568 --> 19:24.337
Oh...

19:24.404 --> 19:26.743
That's... good.

19:26.809 --> 19:28.580
That is comfy.

19:28.646 --> 19:30.684
Now all I need is some music.

19:30.751 --> 19:32.086
TILLMAN:
Oh, okay.

19:32.153 --> 19:33.389
So it's a full-service thing
here?

19:33.455 --> 19:34.892
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, maybe later.

19:34.959 --> 19:36.228
Mm.

19:36.294 --> 19:37.564
So, look,
we've had a few sessions

19:37.631 --> 19:38.967
since your Princeton offer.

19:39.034 --> 19:41.238
And, uh, you know,
I think it's important.

19:41.304 --> 19:42.975
So did you decide?

19:43.042 --> 19:46.448
Yeah, so I thought about
what you said, you know, a lot,

19:46.516 --> 19:49.588
and, uh, I think you're right.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.759
You know,
I was holding on to the pain

19:51.826 --> 19:53.062
for no reason, you know?

19:53.128 --> 19:54.765
They totally win

19:54.832 --> 19:56.569
if I don't use my position
to help people in my experience.

19:56.636 --> 20:01.044
Well, it's not a war to win,
exactly, but that's good.

20:01.111 --> 20:02.848
That's good. So you're going?

20:02.915 --> 20:04.952
Oh, no. Definitely not.

20:05.019 --> 20:07.256
No, I tried. It was a disaster.

20:07.323 --> 20:09.194
Why was it a disaster?

20:09.260 --> 20:11.766
So, I email Princeton,

20:11.833 --> 20:16.074
and I tell 'em, you know,
I'll do the panel or whatever.

20:16.141 --> 20:18.513
And the-the idea was
I'll bring Lottie and Van,

20:18.580 --> 20:21.318
and then afterwards,
I'd take Lottie to Sesame Place.

20:21.384 --> 20:23.857
So we're going
to the airport, you know,

20:23.923 --> 20:25.927
I'm looking for my driver's
license, I can't find it.

20:25.994 --> 20:28.065
It's probably
in my pants somewhere.

20:28.132 --> 20:30.937
So I just bring my passport.
No big deal, right?

20:31.004 --> 20:32.608
Right.

20:32.674 --> 20:36.849
We get to the airport, and we
start to check in, you know,

20:36.916 --> 20:40.189
and the computer prints out
Van's ticket,

20:40.256 --> 20:41.726
and her name's
all spelled wrong.

20:41.793 --> 20:43.262
So I'm like,
"That's fine. It's okay.

20:43.328 --> 20:45.266
We'll go in the priority lane."

20:45.332 --> 20:47.805
You know,
I got platinum status.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.775
We get there, the lady asks
to see my passport.

20:49.842 --> 20:52.380
And I'm like, "Why?
Like, I'm already checked in."

20:52.447 --> 20:54.150
But I give her the passport
anyway.

20:54.217 --> 20:55.954
She looks at it,
hands it back to me

20:56.021 --> 20:57.624
and tells me
it's too damaged to travel.

20:57.691 --> 21:01.098
-On a domestic flight?
-On a domestic flight.

21:01.164 --> 21:02.801
That's exactly what I said.

21:02.868 --> 21:05.072
I mean, the pages were worn,
at best.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.009
Damn. White woman?

21:07.076 --> 21:08.780
I mean, do you even need to ask?

21:08.847 --> 21:11.919
-(scoffs)
-You know, so I'm like,
"That's cool.

21:11.986 --> 21:14.090
Whatever.
Let's get a second opinion."

21:14.157 --> 21:17.163
So she calls over her coworker,
but she's asking her in a way

21:17.230 --> 21:19.768
that's like, "I'm not gonna let
these people on anyway."

21:19.835 --> 21:22.774
And the coworker kind of looks
at us and shrugs like,

21:22.841 --> 21:25.045
"I don't want to get involved
in this bullshit.

21:25.112 --> 21:27.518
I don't agree with her,
but what are you gonna do?"

21:27.584 --> 21:28.953
So at this point, I'm like,

21:29.020 --> 21:30.657
"Let's try the, you know,
emotional angle."

21:30.724 --> 21:32.393
I was like, "I got a child here.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.264
"Here are the passes
for Sesame Place.

21:34.330 --> 21:36.468
Please let us in."

21:36.536 --> 21:38.573
This lady laughs
in my fucking face.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.309
-Wow.
-Yeah, I can't believe it.

21:40.376 --> 21:42.313
I'm like,
"What am I gonna do, wild out?"

21:42.380 --> 21:43.983
You know, I'm at the airport.

21:44.050 --> 21:46.488
(laughs) So I-I don't want
to get on the No Fly List.

21:46.556 --> 21:48.325
Did you ask
to speak to a manager?

21:48.392 --> 21:50.362
-She was the manager.
-Oh, no.

21:50.429 --> 21:51.833
At least, that's what she says.

21:51.899 --> 21:54.137
You know, so she boots us
out of the line.

21:54.204 --> 21:55.640
A couple of minutes later,

21:55.707 --> 21:57.343
Van waves us over
to this Black woman

21:57.410 --> 21:59.480
who's working
at a different counter.

21:59.548 --> 22:00.951
She checks us in, no problem.

22:01.017 --> 22:02.888
She checks our bags, no problem,
and tells us

22:02.955 --> 22:05.426
that that Nazi ticket lady
does this all the time

22:05.494 --> 22:07.230
to Black travelers,
and guess what?

22:07.296 --> 22:08.600
She's not even a manager.

22:08.666 --> 22:10.269
-You're kidding.
-I can't make this shit up.

22:10.336 --> 22:13.510
So, this woman, this nice woman
walks us through security

22:13.576 --> 22:15.045
so we can make it on time.

22:15.112 --> 22:17.383
When we get to the gate,
homegirl must've tattled,

22:17.450 --> 22:19.755
because TSA is right there
waiting for us.

22:19.822 --> 22:22.059
At this point, I'm like,
"Fuck this.

22:22.126 --> 22:24.297
I don't want to go.
I don't care anymore."

22:24.364 --> 22:25.734
Van starts crying. You know,

22:25.800 --> 22:27.504
she's like,
"I'm not gonna go without you."

22:27.571 --> 22:29.575
So, long story short,

22:29.642 --> 22:31.177
we're still waiting
on our baggage.

22:31.244 --> 22:32.948
(scoffs)

22:33.015 --> 22:35.452
I'm really sorry
you had to go through that.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.558
-Yeah.
-Damn.

22:37.624 --> 22:39.728
I mean, tell me, how do you...
how do you feel?

22:39.795 --> 22:43.870
Honestly, the whole time...

22:43.937 --> 22:46.709
I was thinking
about what you said on spite.

22:46.776 --> 22:49.080
(sighs)

22:49.147 --> 22:53.055
Going back to Princeton--
that wasn't important to me.

22:53.121 --> 22:56.596
Facing my past--
that really was, you know?

22:56.662 --> 23:01.271
I was mad about the time
that got wasted.

23:01.338 --> 23:05.079
You know, I-I wanted to spend
that time with Van and Lottie.

23:05.145 --> 23:08.920
You know, I wanted to talk
to Van about the move.

23:08.987 --> 23:10.924
I really wanted
to connect with them.

23:10.991 --> 23:13.763
See, it sounds like you're
recognizing the big picture.

23:13.830 --> 23:16.569
Yeah, the anxiousness
and anger--

23:16.636 --> 23:20.510
you're not gonna achieve
your goals with those, you know?

23:20.577 --> 23:23.415
That's really good, Earn.

23:23.482 --> 23:25.352

23:26.956 --> 23:31.532
You know, it's good
to hear you say that, 'cause...

23:31.599 --> 23:33.569
I've been thinking a lot,
and I-I kind of want

23:33.636 --> 23:36.609
to take some time out
from therapy.

Sure. Yeah, I mean, I'd love

-(laughing)

30:13.234 --> 30:15.472
What you gonna do to me, man?
You know me.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.476
Told you. Watch out
for your cousin. He's sick, man.

30:17.544 --> 30:20.516
-Yeah.
-I'll holler at you, brother.
All right.

30:21.317 --> 30:24.023
How much, um,
did you spend on all this, man?

30:24.090 --> 30:27.897
Enough, but it was worth it,
trust me.

30:27.964 --> 30:31.939
So you did all of this
to hurt one lady?

30:33.174 --> 30:35.646
-Uh-huh.
-ALFRED: Okay.

30:35.713 --> 30:37.316

It's funny.

30:42.827 --> 30:45.098
Wow.

30:45.165 --> 30:49.875
I can't tell if this is extreme,
extreme pettiness...

30:49.941 --> 30:52.413
or terrorism.

30:55.887 --> 30:58.358
Great job.

30:58.425 --> 31:02.132
(chuckles)
It can be both.

31:02.199 --> 31:03.569
Ah.
