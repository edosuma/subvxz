WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.640
George?

00:14.360 --> 00:15.920
Why is time jumping backwards?

00:15.960 --> 00:16.000
Because we made it.

00:16.000 --> 00:16.960
Because we made it.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.440
"We"? We're a top-secret
multinational organisation,

00:19.480 --> 00:23.040
dedicated to preventing and undoing
mass extinction events.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.000
If you use it now...?
We'd wake up yesterday.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.240
If you use it now...?
We'd wake up yesterday.

00:25.280 --> 00:29.120
Till we get to July 1st, 2023,
and that becomes our new checkpoint.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.480
Welcome to the Lazarus Project.

00:33.520 --> 00:34.600
Then there's Rebrov.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.880
He's on almost every
terror watch list in the world.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.000
He's ex-Lazarus?
One of our brightest and best.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.520
He's ex-Lazarus?
One of our brightest and best.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.920
See you later!

01:12.800 --> 01:15.640
Fluffy Southdown.

01:15.680 --> 01:18.520
Really?
Yeah.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.000
What was Fluffy, then? A dog?

01:20.000 --> 01:20.360
What was Fluffy, then? A dog?

01:20.400 --> 01:24.920
Fluffy was my sister's
passive-aggressively-named goldfish.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.920
I was allergic to all the fun pets.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.000
What do you think we did wrong?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.360
What do you think we did wrong?

01:29.400 --> 01:31.120
Almost everything.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.520
Hey...

01:33.560 --> 01:36.000
We'll do better next time.
We can't do much worse.

01:36.000 --> 01:36.120
We'll do better next time.
We can't do much worse.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.760
It wasn't your fault.
You're just being nice.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.000
I would never and intentionally
be nice to you. By accident, though?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.120
I would never and intentionally
be nice to you. By accident, though?

01:50.400 --> 01:52.000
Maybe it won't happen.

01:52.000 --> 01:52.120
Maybe it won't happen.

01:52.160 --> 01:55.800
It'll happen.
Come on, best seats in the house!

02:09.160 --> 02:13.680
Gary Appleyard is my porn-star name.

02:13.720 --> 02:16.000
Gary Appleyard
is a terrible porn-star name.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.320
Gary Appleyard
is a terrible porn-star name.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.720
I know.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.560
Gary Appleyard!

02:38.640 --> 02:40.000
"You got Rebrov?" French police
raided the flat after a tipoff.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.440
"You got Rebrov?" French police
raided the flat after a tipoff.

02:42.480 --> 02:45.720
Picked up some of his guys and they
gave us a location, the grasses.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.000
That's fantastic.
Yeah. We're moving on him now.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.920
That's fantastic.
Yeah. We're moving on him now.

02:48.960 --> 02:52.000
I thought you might like to be here
for it. Yeah, absolutely.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.000
George?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
George?

02:59.560 --> 03:02.880
Have we got any of our operatives on
the road? No time. Just the locals.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.000
Great. The most wanted man
in the world is within our grasp

03:04.000 --> 03:06.400
Great. The most wanted man
in the world is within our grasp

03:06.440 --> 03:08.520
and we're sending
in Inspector Clouseau.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.600
It's French Special Forces.
I think we'll be all right.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.000
I dated a guy
in the French Special Forces once.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.800
I dated a guy
in the French Special Forces once.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.920
Soul of a poet,

03:15.960 --> 03:17.840
hands of a butcher.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.000
C'mon. C'mon.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.400
C'mon. C'mon.

03:21.440 --> 03:25.160
""

03:27.320 --> 03:28.000
They're getting in position.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.800
They're getting in position.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
This isn't your fault.

04:08.000 --> 04:08.040
This isn't your fault.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.480
Rebrov?

04:10.520 --> 04:11.800
We got him.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
She's out of surgery,
but she's still unconscious.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.960
She's out of surgery,
but she's still unconscious.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.800
When will she wake up?
It's too early to say.

04:20.840 --> 04:23.520
My advice is to go home,
get some rest.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.000
But... she's gonna wake up, though?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.840
But... she's gonna wake up, though?

04:26.880 --> 04:28.920
Right?
We don't know yet.

05:05.080 --> 05:08.000
'Remind me why we're here again.'

05:18.880 --> 05:20.000
It's a party. It's fun.

05:20.000 --> 05:20.640
It's a party. It's fun.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.960
Whose house is this?
My brother's girlfriend's cousin.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.320
They'll be relieved we're here

05:25.360 --> 05:27.720
Please don't be a fucking Scrooge
all night.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.000
I'm in Camden,

05:28.000 --> 05:29.280
I'm in Camden,

05:29.320 --> 05:32.320
drinking wine
from a World's Best Aunt mug.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.280
How could I possibly not
be enjoying myself?

05:34.320 --> 05:36.000
What have you got against Camden?

05:36.000 --> 05:36.720
What have you got against Camden?

05:36.760 --> 05:40.240
Hey! What you sayin'?

05:40.280 --> 05:42.680
Anyway, there's a girl here.
There's a lot of girls here.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.000
A specific girl.
My brother wanted you to meet her.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.640
A specific girl.
My brother wanted you to meet her.

05:45.680 --> 05:48.200
He said she's fun and smart
and beautiful,

05:48.240 --> 05:50.880
so one can only assume
she'll find a partner

05:50.920 --> 05:52.000
who shares at least one
of those qualities with her,

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
who shares at least one
of those qualities with her,

05:53.040 --> 05:56.720
but if not, apparently
you two should really hit it off.

05:56.760 --> 05:59.600
This girl got a name?
Er, Sarah.

05:59.640 --> 06:00.000
Sarah.
Yeah.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.960
Sarah.
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
So we are gonna try
and track her down

06:03.040 --> 06:07.200
and when we do, you two can,
I don't know, have babies

06:07.240 --> 06:08.000
and live happily ever after
and all that, yeah?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.800
and live happily ever after
and all that, yeah?

06:16.480 --> 06:18.160
George.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.120
George? We're here.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.000
Sorry.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.120
Sorry.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.520
What were you thinking about?

06:28.520 --> 06:31.480
Erm, when me and Sarah met.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.000
Love at first sight?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.440
Love at first sight?

06:35.440 --> 06:37.440
Yeah, I think so.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.800
How long have you known each other?

06:41.160 --> 06:43.880
Erm, we met in...

06:43.920 --> 06:46.280
..the summer of 2018.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.000
What?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.520
What?

06:49.560 --> 06:51.560
Nothing.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.960
I was on a mission summer 2018.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.320
It didn't go well.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.800
Where do you keep your booze?

07:17.040 --> 07:18.720
I read a study somewhere that said

07:18.760 --> 07:20.000
you're not meant to drink
after a trauma. That's bullshit.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.160
you're not meant to drink
after a trauma. That's bullshit.

07:31.760 --> 07:34.840
So there are versions of my life

07:34.880 --> 07:36.000
that were undone by the time loop,

07:36.000 --> 07:37.440
that were undone by the time loop,

07:37.480 --> 07:40.160
so other paths I took

07:40.200 --> 07:42.480
that got reversed.

07:43.640 --> 07:44.000
What happens to all that,
the stuff I've forgot?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.200
What happens to all that,
the stuff I've forgot?

07:46.240 --> 07:49.880
When you get the jab, like I did,
it all comes back in a wave.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.000
It just hits you suddenly.

07:52.000 --> 07:52.080
It just hits you suddenly.

07:52.120 --> 07:56.040
For you, mutants, it depends.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.320
You might start to recall fragments
slowly,

07:58.360 --> 08:00.000
you might remember it all at once,
you might never remember it.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.400
you might remember it all at once,
you might never remember it.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.640
Why, are you starting to see things?
Yeah. Maybe.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.400
I don't know.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.440
The summer of 2018,

08:13.480 --> 08:16.000
did you reset the clock?
Yeah.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.200
did you reset the clock?
Yeah.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.360
How many times?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.840
A lot.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.000
Yesterday was the checkpoint.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.680
Yesterday was the checkpoint.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.680
She was OK yesterday.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.360
She still might be.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.000
What if she's not?
The world will be a sadder place,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.960
What if she's not?
The world will be a sadder place,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.400
and I will be there
to get you through it.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.680
When you got Rebrov,

08:43.720 --> 08:46.200
did he say anything?
No.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.000
He's not the talkative type.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
He's not the talkative type.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.400
"Approaching base
with Rebrov on board."

09:24.640 --> 09:28.000
You're with NATO?
We're not officially affiliated.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.040
You're with NATO?
We're not officially affiliated.

09:30.080 --> 09:33.880
No? Well, you cleared
our security checks.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.000
Now, you have five minutes
of my time. What do you want?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.200
Now, you have five minutes
of my time. What do you want?

09:39.200 --> 09:41.640
Last week,
one of your F-class fighters

09:41.680 --> 09:43.520
was shot down
over the Kazakh region.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.000
And how do you know?
We just know.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.160
And how do you know?
We just know.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.920
It was the Modhin.
It wasn't the Modhin.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.000
I have satellite photos. Yeah.
They're wrong. It wasn't the Modhin.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.880
I have satellite photos. Yeah.
They're wrong. It wasn't the Modhin.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.720
It was General Zima's men.
They want you to retaliate.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.000
They want you to fire on the Modhin
so the Modhin fire on you.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.280
They want you to fire on the Modhin
so the Modhin fire on you.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.440
Then they're gonna use that as
an excuse to push into this region.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.360
They're going to tell you
it's to support you, but it's not.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.600
But that... That's gonna lead
to a chain of events

10:10.640 --> 10:13.760
that will culminate in NATO putting
ground troops on your border.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.680
Then people are gonna start
firing missiles

10:15.720 --> 10:16.000
and, trust me on this, it doesn't
get any better from there.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.080
and, trust me on this, it doesn't
get any better from there.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.000
General Zima is going to make
a friendly invasion

10:24.000 --> 10:27.080
General Zima is going to make
a friendly invasion

10:27.120 --> 10:29.800
and NATO is going to put troops
on the border?

10:29.840 --> 10:32.000
Yes.
Why?

10:32.000 --> 10:32.600
Yes.
Why?

10:32.640 --> 10:36.000
Because the Modhin
didn't shoot down your jet.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.320
Diplomacy,

10:43.360 --> 10:47.760
from the French "diplomatie",

10:47.800 --> 10:48.000
a back-form from "diplomatique",

10:48.000 --> 10:50.760
a back-form from "diplomatique",

10:50.800 --> 10:53.840
ultimately deriving from the Latin
"diploma,"

10:53.880 --> 10:56.000
meaning a letter of recommendation
or authority.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.280
meaning a letter of recommendation
or authority.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.720
The idea being
that someone with some clout,

11:00.760 --> 11:03.960
a bit of something about them,
a bit of fucking chutzpah,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.640
could come along
and sort out a problem

11:06.680 --> 11:09.520
by dint of the fact that people
fucking listened to them.

11:09.560 --> 11:12.000
See, that's our problem.
No-one fucking listens to us.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.400
See, that's our problem.
No-one fucking listens to us.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.440
We've got a time machine
and no-one listens to us.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.800
No-one knows
we've got a time machine.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.000
We should tell people.
Yeah, that's what we should do.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
We should tell people.
Yeah, that's what we should do.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.080
This guy's gonna keep starting
World War III

11:25.120 --> 11:27.240
if we don't do something drastic.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.000
So let's do something drastic.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.800
So let's do something drastic.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.000
I spoke to Carol.

11:36.000 --> 11:36.600
I spoke to Carol.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.680
What did she say?

11:38.720 --> 11:42.560
Ah, she was just sad,
more than anything.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.360
When did you speak to her?

11:47.400 --> 11:49.400
Before the checkpoint.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.000
I spoke to Jim.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.680
I spoke to Jim.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.400
When?

11:56.440 --> 11:58.840
After.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.000
Coward.
I'll tell him again.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.680
Coward.
I'll tell him again.

12:15.800 --> 12:16.000
You really don't need
to come in today.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.400
You really don't need
to come in today.

12:20.480 --> 12:24.000
You just caught
the world's most dangerous terrorist.

12:24.000 --> 12:24.480
You just caught
the world's most dangerous terrorist.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.480
Doesn't sound like a day I can skip.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.920
It is absolutely a day you can skip.
I wanna come in.

12:33.360 --> 12:35.320
I need to.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.840
This is just a standard debrief.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.000
Post-traumatic stress
is common here.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.080
Post-traumatic stress
is common here.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.640
You lived through something
life-changing but technically...

12:59.680 --> 13:02.320
It didn't happen.
It happened.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.000
But it can be disorientating.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.280
But it can be disorientating.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.760
Isolating.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.600
You saw The Dane get shot.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.000
Yeah.
Have you thought about it much?

13:12.000 --> 13:12.920
Yeah.
Have you thought about it much?

13:12.960 --> 13:16.080
Till my girlfriend got hit
by a rubbish truck.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.120
That's taking up
most of my headspace.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.000
You heard me die.
Yeah, but you came back.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.640
You heard me die.
Yeah, but you came back.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.400
Yes.
Because we turned back time.

13:23.440 --> 13:27.080
Because the bomb went off.
You understand that, don't you?

13:27.120 --> 13:28.000
The only reason we came back
is because of the bomb.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.760
The only reason we came back
is because of the bomb.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.640
It must be pretty upsetting for you,

13:32.680 --> 13:35.480
knowing that your friends
would've just let you stay dead.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.000
That's the deal.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.080
That's the deal.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.720
I don't expect anyone to play God
for me. Why not?

13:40.760 --> 13:44.000
What harm would it have done?
Four babies are born every second.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.160
What harm would it have done?
Four babies are born every second.

13:45.200 --> 13:49.400
That's 250 babies a minute.
15,000 in an hour.

13:49.440 --> 13:52.000
360,000 babies in a day.
2.5 million babies in a week.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
360,000 babies in a day.
2.5 million babies in a week.

13:56.040 --> 13:59.160
If we went back in time
to just over nine months ago

13:59.200 --> 14:00.000
and changed the course of the world,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.440
and changed the course of the world,

14:01.480 --> 14:05.360
how many infants that are alive
today would never even be conceived?

14:05.400 --> 14:07.640
How much progress would we lose?

14:07.680 --> 14:08.000
I've seen entire social movements
disappear,

14:08.000 --> 14:11.400
I've seen entire social movements
disappear,

14:11.440 --> 14:13.720
world-changing events undone.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.000
So we only do it
when the alternative is worse.

14:16.040 --> 14:19.200
See, the thing is, even if we did
change time by nine months,

14:19.240 --> 14:21.240
there'd still be four babies born
every second,

14:21.280 --> 14:23.320
they'd just be different babies.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.000
We're just giving them a chance.
No-one would know, no-one would care.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.600
We're just giving them a chance.
No-one would know, no-one would care.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.160
So we had an agent here,

14:30.200 --> 14:31.720
Janet,

14:31.760 --> 14:32.000
she got pregnant
and she gave birth to a little boy

14:32.000 --> 14:34.760
she got pregnant
and she gave birth to a little boy

14:34.800 --> 14:36.920
just before the checkpoint.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.000
I've never seen anyone so terrified,
because she knew...

14:40.000 --> 14:40.160
I've never seen anyone so terrified,
because she knew...

14:40.200 --> 14:42.800
If you reset time,
you go back to before the conception.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.120
..her baby would be gone.

14:45.160 --> 14:48.000
Well, guess what?
It happened and she lost her child.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.800
Well, guess what?
It happened and she lost her child.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.280
She got pregnant again
but, of course...

14:52.320 --> 14:54.000
It was a different kid.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.000
That's happened to millions,
billions, of other women

14:56.000 --> 14:56.440
That's happened to millions,
billions, of other women

14:56.480 --> 14:57.920
without them even knowing it.

14:57.960 --> 15:02.040
Why don't you just say it, OK,
Archie?

15:08.280 --> 15:12.000
You can't turn back time
to stop what happened to Sarah.

15:12.000 --> 15:12.800
You can't turn back time
to stop what happened to Sarah.

15:27.880 --> 15:28.000
General Kasan's been paid off
by Zima.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.200
General Kasan's been paid off
by Zima.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.240
He knows the missile strikes
are set up, he just doesn't care.

15:34.280 --> 15:36.000
So much for diplomacy.

15:36.040 --> 15:38.200
I think diplomacy's
still on the table.

15:40.280 --> 15:42.600
Just not with Kasan around.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.920
That smells disgusting.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.640
It's a local delicacy.

15:51.680 --> 15:52.000
It's like a boiled donut
filled with ham.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.160
It's like a boiled donut
filled with ham.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.520
It's all right, actually.

15:59.560 --> 16:00.000
Here he comes.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.680
Here he comes.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.000
I was thinking, by the way,

16:08.000 --> 16:09.080
I was thinking, by the way,

16:09.120 --> 16:12.120
I want you to move in with me.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.400
I said I wanted...

16:20.800 --> 16:23.240
I don't know if I'm ready.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.000
OK.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.240
OK.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.760
I'll think about it.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.600
(BEEPING HASTENS

17:07.800 --> 17:09.240
She's called Sarah.

17:09.280 --> 17:12.000
That's it? That's all the information
you've got? That's all I've got.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.920
That's it? That's all the information
you've got? That's all I've got.

17:12.960 --> 17:14.680
Thanks

17:14.720 --> 17:16.560
Yeah, good luck!

17:16.600 --> 17:19.680
you know where I'll be

17:34.320 --> 17:36.000
Do you wanna play a game?

17:36.000 --> 17:36.360
Do you wanna play a game?

17:36.400 --> 17:40.280
It's called Wee, Poo, Cocaine.
It's a guessing game.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.320
I'm actually going in there
to have a cry, so...

17:43.360 --> 17:44.000
You might wanna rethink the name.
Not enjoying the party?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.760
You might wanna rethink the name.
Not enjoying the party?

17:45.800 --> 17:48.360
Er, I'm not very good at them.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.680
No such thing
as being good at parties. No? No!

17:51.720 --> 17:52.000
You're not... You're not getting
a performance review!

17:52.000 --> 17:55.520
You're not... You're not getting
a performance review!

17:55.560 --> 17:57.920
Attendance is the only criteria.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.000
Don't let anyone tell you different.
Your name's not Sarah, is it?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.560
Don't let anyone tell you different.
Your name's not Sarah, is it?

18:01.600 --> 18:02.960
Why?

18:03.000 --> 18:06.680
I'm supposed to find this girl
called Sarah.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.000
Apparently, she's perfect for me.

18:08.000 --> 18:08.360
Apparently, she's perfect for me.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.640
So, you believe in predeterminism?

18:10.680 --> 18:14.800
How do you mean? You believe
the one perfect person is out there

18:14.840 --> 18:16.000
and you merely have to find them.

18:16.000 --> 18:16.960
and you merely have to find them.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.960
Er, I dunno.
I was just told to find this girl.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.520
Well, my name is Hayley.
Oh!

18:22.560 --> 18:24.000
Sorry!

18:24.000 --> 18:25.240
Sorry!

18:25.280 --> 18:28.280
Your search continues. Good luck.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.000
Thanks.

18:33.600 --> 18:37.920
underneath the hot sun

18:41.720 --> 18:45.880
underneath the hot sun

18:58.760 --> 19:01.440
Did you speak to Jim again?

19:01.480 --> 19:03.880
Breaks his heart every time.

19:03.920 --> 19:04.000
Why don't you just wait

19:04.000 --> 19:05.520
Why don't you just wait

19:05.560 --> 19:08.200
until you know we're not
going to have to go back again?

19:08.240 --> 19:10.920
I dunno. Penance, maybe?

19:10.960 --> 19:12.000
Better than living a lie.

19:12.000 --> 19:12.960
Better than living a lie.

19:14.840 --> 19:17.400
So, if we stop World War III
breaking out,

19:17.440 --> 19:20.000
do you still wanna move in?

19:20.000 --> 19:20.160
do you still wanna move in?

19:20.200 --> 19:21.760
Yeah.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.760
Now there's motivation.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.640
Oh, before I forget,

19:40.680 --> 19:43.960
there's a girl called Sarah
and she is...

20:06.760 --> 20:08.000
Who changed my song?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.400
Who changed my song?

20:11.160 --> 20:13.920
Did you change my song?

20:13.960 --> 20:16.000
No.
You're holding a CD.

20:16.000 --> 20:16.560
No.
You're holding a CD.

20:20.440 --> 20:22.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was me.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.000
Why did you change my song?
Did you put that on intentionally?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.120
Why did you change my song?
Did you put that on intentionally?

20:26.160 --> 20:30.040
I just didn't think anyone would put
that on intentionally. Well, I did.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.000
Yeah, I see that.

20:32.000 --> 20:32.120
Yeah, I see that.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.160
Intentionally.
Because that's your song. Yes!

20:37.560 --> 20:39.920
Can I ask you a question?

20:40.920 --> 20:43.040
"Why is that my song?"
Yeah.

20:43.080 --> 20:47.200
Erm, cos it's a good song.
Erm, objectively, it's not.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.000
There's no such thing
as objective quality in the arts.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.120
There's no such thing
as objective quality in the arts.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.800
Tell that to Beethoven.

20:51.840 --> 20:55.600
You're thinking of
collective subjectivity.

20:55.640 --> 20:56.000
I could tell that to Beethoven.
Or Shakespeare. Or Picasso.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.880
I could tell that to Beethoven.
Or Shakespeare. Or Picasso.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.960
They're not intrinsically good, they
just happen to have a lot of fans.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.320
Collective subjectivity
is a thing you just made up!

21:06.360 --> 21:09.080
No, I just don't like Beethoven
very much!

21:14.480 --> 21:16.920
I'm George, by the way.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.600
Sarah.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.000
I'm training to be a teacher.
Oh, yeah? Who you teaching?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.800
I'm training to be a teacher.
Oh, yeah? Who you teaching?

21:29.840 --> 21:31.760
Children.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.280
They're gonna love your acerbic
bon mots. Someone has to.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.000
What do you do? Er...

21:36.000 --> 21:38.640
What do you do? Er...

21:38.680 --> 21:41.080
Everybody needs to get out!

21:41.120 --> 21:44.000
Er, what?
Someone dropped a cigarette!

21:44.000 --> 21:44.680
Er, what?
Someone dropped a cigarette!

21:44.720 --> 21:46.960
Shit, my bag!
I'm not kidding! Come on!

21:47.000 --> 21:49.960
I'll catch you outside, yeah? OK!
Yeah?

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Come on! Hurry up!

21:52.000 --> 21:52.760
Come on! Hurry up!

22:10.440 --> 22:13.160
Don't tell me
you dropped a cigarette in there.

22:15.760 --> 22:16.000
It was a joint, actually.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.880
It was a joint, actually.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.320
Do you think I should tell them
it was me?

22:21.360 --> 22:24.000
Oh, my God!
Has anybody seen my cat?

22:24.000 --> 22:24.360
Oh, my God!
Has anybody seen my cat?

22:25.520 --> 22:28.400
I really think you shouldn't.

23:05.560 --> 23:08.160
D'you wanna fuck him up?

23:09.520 --> 23:11.600
What?

23:11.640 --> 23:12.000
The guy that pushed your missus
in front of a truck.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.520
The guy that pushed your missus
in front of a truck.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.640
Do you wanna fuck him up?

23:20.720 --> 23:22.760
Get in the car.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.960
But I thought you were the sensible,

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
heavy-burden-of-responsibility guy.

23:36.000 --> 23:36.280
heavy-burden-of-responsibility guy.

23:36.320 --> 23:39.040
And? That's me.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.960
So, what's happening now?

23:46.000 --> 23:49.400
Well, as I understand it, a man,
albeit accidentally,

23:49.440 --> 23:51.400
pushed your missus
in front of a truck.

23:51.440 --> 23:52.000
That's right.

23:52.000 --> 23:52.840
That's right.

23:52.880 --> 23:55.360
I'm all for holding the delicate
strands of faith in my hands

23:55.400 --> 24:00.000
and then ironing out the creases
in the fabric of space and time,

24:00.000 --> 24:00.720
and then ironing out the creases
in the fabric of space and time,

24:00.760 --> 24:03.120
don't get me wrong.
Really?

24:03.160 --> 24:07.280
But a guy pushed your missus
in front of a truck.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.000
That's all I'm saying.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.800
That's all I'm saying.

24:09.840 --> 24:12.640
So?
So...

24:12.680 --> 24:14.480
..do you wanna fuck him up?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.000
Yes, I do.

24:16.000 --> 24:16.360
Yes, I do.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.040
Right, then.

24:25.040 --> 24:28.360
You'll admit
a wrong has been committed?

24:28.400 --> 24:31.680
You'll admit something bad
has happened,

24:31.720 --> 24:32.000
for which there requires retribution?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.680
for which there requires retribution?

24:33.720 --> 24:35.400
You'd help me beat up this guy
for what he did?

24:35.440 --> 24:37.640
I'll fucking headbutt the prick.
But you wouldn't undo it?

24:37.680 --> 24:40.000
Archie gave you the
"one baby every four seconds" talk?

24:40.000 --> 24:40.120
Archie gave you the
"one baby every four seconds" talk?

24:40.160 --> 24:44.240
Yeah.
No point having it twice, then.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.400
It's four babies every one second.

24:46.440 --> 24:48.000
Oh, God. That's even worse.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.960
Oh, God. That's even worse.

24:59.160 --> 25:02.680
So, what, we just wait for him to
come to the door and just punch him?

25:02.720 --> 25:04.000
Unless you think
you can punch through the door,

25:04.000 --> 25:05.480
Unless you think
you can punch through the door,

25:05.520 --> 25:07.880
which would be pretty fucking cool.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.840
What's the matter?

25:14.880 --> 25:17.120
It's not gonna reverse it, is it?
We have very good connections

25:17.160 --> 25:18.560
with law enforcement.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.000
I guarantee you won't get
in trouble. I don't want revenge,

25:20.000 --> 25:21.600
I guarantee you won't get
in trouble. I don't want revenge,

25:21.640 --> 25:24.880
I want it undone.
Revenge is the best I can offer you.

25:27.840 --> 25:28.000
There's no point.
Why not?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.360
There's no point.
Why not?

25:33.920 --> 25:36.000
Cos what's done is done.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.680
Cos what's done is done.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.760
Yeah.
Yeah.

25:44.480 --> 25:47.400
Every time we try and have
a conversation with these people,

25:47.440 --> 25:50.160
they start shooting at us.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.200
I was thinking, you know,
about my place,

25:55.240 --> 25:57.200
I'm probably gonna let Carol
keep it.

25:57.240 --> 26:00.000
Your flat's pretty small, so we
should look to get somewhere new.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.040
Your flat's pretty small, so we
should look to get somewhere new.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.840
Now? Really now?

26:03.880 --> 26:06.320
We could rent
for a few months, if you like,

26:06.360 --> 26:08.000
while we're looking for something
to buy.

26:08.000 --> 26:08.560
while we're looking for something
to buy.

26:10.760 --> 26:14.760
I think we'll have to. I can't get a
mortgage in principle that quickly.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.000
We could stay in a hotel.

26:16.000 --> 26:16.080
We could stay in a hotel.

26:16.120 --> 26:19.640
Hotels drive me crazy
after about a week.

26:19.680 --> 26:21.360
Me too.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.000
Do you know what we should do?

26:24.000 --> 26:24.600
Do you know what we should do?

26:35.720 --> 26:36.840
Hey.

26:36.880 --> 26:40.000
You OK?
Er, yeah.

26:40.000 --> 26:40.200
You OK?
Er, yeah.

26:44.280 --> 26:46.280
It's work.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.960
"What happened? We were undercover."

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
A bullet bounced off
a fire extinguisher.

26:56.000 --> 26:56.320
A bullet bounced off
a fire extinguisher.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.760
Well, that was unlucky.
"Yeah."

27:02.760 --> 27:04.000
What happened to you?
"I didn't get far."

27:04.000 --> 27:05.080
What happened to you?
"I didn't get far."

27:05.120 --> 27:08.520
But I did get an idea. I'll meet you
at the airport tomorrow.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.600
"We're gonna go back
to that shithole,

27:10.640 --> 27:12.000
hopefully for the last time."

27:12.000 --> 27:13.280
hopefully for the last time."

27:13.320 --> 27:15.800
OK. Ross, listen,

27:15.840 --> 27:17.600
are you OK?

27:17.640 --> 27:18.640
Yeah.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.000
I mean, I died.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.720
I mean, I died.

27:21.760 --> 27:25.800
Yeah. Try not to do it again!

27:25.840 --> 27:27.760
"OK! "

27:29.560 --> 27:31.800
I...

27:31.840 --> 27:34.680
..like what we were talking about.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.000
Before I got shot.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.600
Before I got shot.

27:38.080 --> 27:40.120
Me too. Me too.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.560
Jim?

28:00.760 --> 28:02.600
I don't think I love you any more.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.360
I know.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.360
I'm sorry.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.000
Rebrov's coming in tonight.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.280
Rebrov's coming in tonight.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.320
Yes.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.280
He is.

28:29.320 --> 28:30.840
What's his deal?

28:30.880 --> 28:32.000
He's a lunatic.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.600
He's a lunatic.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.840
It's got to be more than that.

28:40.360 --> 28:42.240
What happened?

28:42.280 --> 28:44.640
There was a mission.

28:44.680 --> 28:47.560
Let me guess, it went bad?

28:50.120 --> 28:52.840
Wanna go and talk to him now?

29:41.600 --> 29:43.000
Hello, Rebrov.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.000
Ah, Shiv,

29:44.000 --> 29:44.560
Ah, Shiv,

29:44.600 --> 29:46.760
you look drunk.

29:48.480 --> 29:52.000
I remember you from Paris.
Last one standing.

29:52.000 --> 29:52.040
I remember you from Paris.
Last one standing.

29:52.080 --> 29:54.160
How's The Dane?

29:54.200 --> 29:56.680
Angry you shot him.
He was always sensitive.

29:56.720 --> 30:00.000
George wanted to come and see
what you look like.

30:00.000 --> 30:00.480
George wanted to come and see
what you look like.

30:01.960 --> 30:04.320
I look like a man standing in a box.

30:04.360 --> 30:06.080
Disappointed?

30:06.120 --> 30:08.000
Have they got you running missions,
then, George? Paris was my first.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.720
Have they got you running missions,
then, George? Paris was my first.

30:09.760 --> 30:12.200
Oh, you messed that one up!

30:12.240 --> 30:13.840
Dunno about that. You are here.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.000
He's salty.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.320
He's salty.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.960
Enjoying working with Shiv?

30:19.000 --> 30:22.280
Is he as much fun as he used to be?
"Chuckles" we used to call him.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.880
Non-stop party when Shiv's around.

30:23.920 --> 30:24.000
Where's Big Boy?

30:24.000 --> 30:25.640
Where's Big Boy?

30:25.680 --> 30:28.240
Who's big boy? The thermonuclear
device you detonated

30:28.280 --> 30:31.040
in the centre
of a major European city.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.000
Oh, yeah, of course.

30:32.000 --> 30:32.400
Oh, yeah, of course.

30:32.440 --> 30:35.320
Should I have a lawyer present?
You don't get a fucking lawyer.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.720
I know that.
I used to work here, remember?

30:37.760 --> 30:39.280
Where's the warhead?

30:40.320 --> 30:43.600
See, I actually don't know.
It got delivered to me in Paris,

30:43.640 --> 30:47.000
but then you turned back time
and picked me up, so...

30:47.040 --> 30:48.000
..it could be anywhere.

30:48.000 --> 30:48.560
..it could be anywhere.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.760
I imagine you'll want to, er,
interrogate me at length about it.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.000
Did you know they do that, George?

30:56.000 --> 30:56.120
Did you know they do that, George?

30:56.160 --> 30:59.240
Did you know the Lazarus Project
tortures people?

30:59.280 --> 31:01.440
Oh, yeah.

31:01.480 --> 31:04.000
Quite the shady little
secret society you've joined.

31:04.000 --> 31:04.560
Quite the shady little
secret society you've joined.

31:04.600 --> 31:08.000
It was Shiv, in fact, who was the
first of us to get into all that.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.840
Who was the guy?

31:09.880 --> 31:12.000
Some despot funnelling money
to a rogue state.

31:12.000 --> 31:12.080
Some despot funnelling money
to a rogue state.

31:12.120 --> 31:15.160
Who can remember which one? They all
start to look the fucking same.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.600
Anyway, Shiv gets him into a room

31:17.640 --> 31:20.000
and starts going at him with the rag
in the mouth and the jug of water,

31:20.000 --> 31:20.920
and starts going at him with the rag
in the mouth and the jug of water,

31:20.960 --> 31:24.280
the whole circus.
Really went to town on the guy.

31:24.320 --> 31:27.280
That was just the first.
Wes never liked it,

31:27.320 --> 31:28.000
but Wes never stopped it.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.760
but Wes never stopped it.

31:30.800 --> 31:32.560
If you look closely, George,

31:32.600 --> 31:35.840
you'll notice a distinct lack
of security cameras in this room.

31:35.880 --> 31:36.000
It's one thing
breaking your moral code,

31:36.000 --> 31:38.240
It's one thing
breaking your moral code,

31:38.280 --> 31:41.000
it's another thing
watching it back on tape, eh, Shiv?

31:41.040 --> 31:42.320
I'm not gonna be lectured on morals

31:42.360 --> 31:44.000
by a man who's killed
hundreds of thousands of people.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.640
by a man who's killed
hundreds of thousands of people.

31:45.680 --> 31:49.600
Technically, I barely killed anyone.
You always turn back the clock.

31:49.640 --> 31:51.360
Good old Shiv.

31:51.400 --> 31:52.000
Good old Lazarus Project!

31:52.000 --> 31:54.480
Good old Lazarus Project!

31:54.520 --> 31:57.200
Eh, maybe they'll let you have a go
at me, George.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.040
Maybe you'll get
to pull my fingernails out.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.000
Probably all buy you a round
at the bar after.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.880
Probably all buy you a round
at the bar after.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.840
Do they still do after-work drinks?
Does Shiv still sit in the corner

32:04.880 --> 32:06.800
hoping everyone
can see him brooding?

32:06.840 --> 32:08.000
Fucking karaoke!

32:08.000 --> 32:08.640
Fucking karaoke!

32:08.680 --> 32:10.680
Jesus Christ!

32:10.720 --> 32:12.400
How's Archie, by the way?
I shot her, too.

32:12.440 --> 32:15.000
Go fuck yourself.
Marvellous!

32:15.040 --> 32:16.000
You finally got me in a cell,

32:16.000 --> 32:16.920
You finally got me in a cell,

32:16.960 --> 32:19.800
one-to-one, and "go fuck yourself"
is the best you could come up with!

32:19.840 --> 32:22.200
Real warrior poet
you turned out to be!

32:22.240 --> 32:24.000
You know what they do here, George?

32:24.000 --> 32:24.120
You know what they do here, George?

32:24.160 --> 32:27.320
They sacrifice life
to destroy death.

32:27.360 --> 32:32.000
And it weighs pretty fucking heavy
on them.

32:32.040 --> 32:35.920
This is a waste of time.
Enjoy your box.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.080
I left my booze in the car.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.000
See, the thing is, George,
these people,

32:40.000 --> 32:40.880
See, the thing is, George,
these people,

32:40.920 --> 32:44.920
they wield incredible power
but they're just people.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.680
They're not divinely chosen.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.000
They're not brighter or smarter
than anyone else.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
They're not brighter or smarter
than anyone else.

32:49.040 --> 32:53.840
They're just the kids
you used to sit next to in school.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.000
But they'll happily play God
when it suits them.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.280
But they'll happily play God
when it suits them.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.920
What happens in this place
is an affront.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.960
The world has died, George,
a hundred times over.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
It wants to die
and we keep cheating it out of it.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.400
It wants to die
and we keep cheating it out of it.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.560
Our time was up long ago

33:09.600 --> 33:12.000
and they're still refusing
to let go.

33:12.000 --> 33:12.840
and they're still refusing
to let go.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.080
Is that why you do what you do?

33:22.520 --> 33:24.640
I do what I do...

33:28.640 --> 33:32.160
..because there's no-one else
to hold them to account.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.000
And because they can't hold back
the inevitable forever.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.760
And because they can't hold back
the inevitable forever.

33:54.760 --> 33:56.440
Are you OK?

33:58.360 --> 34:00.000
Yeah.

34:00.000 --> 34:00.560
Yeah.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.760
It doesn't matter how far down
the chain of command we go,

34:05.800 --> 34:08.000
the whole government's
corrupt as hell.

34:08.000 --> 34:08.480
the whole government's
corrupt as hell.

34:08.520 --> 34:10.320
What about the opposition party?

34:14.440 --> 34:15.680
Alexander Puhvel?

34:15.720 --> 34:16.000
The fascist? He has some unappealing
views on certain things, yes.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.120
The fascist? He has some unappealing
views on certain things, yes.

34:20.160 --> 34:23.280
Like Jews, Muslims, homosexuals,

34:23.320 --> 34:24.000
women.
Yeah, you know, that kind of thing.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.240
women.
Yeah, you know, that kind of thing.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.720
That kind of thing. There isn't
a lot to recommend Puhvel,

34:27.760 --> 34:32.000
but I will say this for him,
he hates General Zima.

34:32.000 --> 34:32.120
but I will say this for him,
he hates General Zima.

34:32.160 --> 34:34.160
So, we get him into power?

34:34.200 --> 34:36.240
Prime Minister Osiminov is weak.

34:36.280 --> 34:39.160
That's why he's about to start
World War III.

34:41.240 --> 34:45.080
You wanna do a little
coup d'fucking-etat. Yes, I do.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.760
And later,
when the fascists are in charge?

34:47.800 --> 34:48.000
We'll deal with it.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.640
We'll deal with it.

34:49.680 --> 34:51.920
Somebody will deal with it.

34:51.960 --> 34:54.960
It's not perfect
but it's what we've got.

35:02.120 --> 35:04.000
The thing about starting a coup,

35:04.000 --> 35:04.200
The thing about starting a coup,

35:04.240 --> 35:06.520
is you need to make the people
doing the couping

35:06.560 --> 35:09.400
feel like it was their idea.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.000
I don't think couping is the verb
of coup d'etat, but go on.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.200
I don't think couping is the verb
of coup d'etat, but go on.

35:14.640 --> 35:18.280
Historically, nothing riles up
the politically extreme opposition

35:18.320 --> 35:20.000
more than a few well-placed arrests
and assassinations.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.600
more than a few well-placed arrests
and assassinations.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.560
Did someone just shoot him?

35:50.480 --> 35:52.000
Her name's Sarah.

35:52.000 --> 35:52.440
Her name's Sarah.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.960
Yeah?

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
"Military officials
have threatened to escalate..."

36:00.000 --> 36:00.440
"Military officials
have threatened to escalate..."

36:00.480 --> 36:03.560
I thought couping
would be easier than this.

36:07.440 --> 36:08.000
We'll try again.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.960
We'll try again.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.920
Yo. Can I hit that?

36:14.960 --> 36:16.000
You've got to be careful on it,
though. It's really strong, yeah?

36:16.000 --> 36:19.680
You've got to be careful on it,
though. It's really strong, yeah?

36:22.560 --> 36:24.000
Hi!

36:24.000 --> 36:24.320
Hi!

36:29.560 --> 36:31.520
You're welcome.

36:37.120 --> 36:40.000
"The coup was quickly quashed
by government forces..."

36:40.000 --> 36:41.400
"The coup was quickly quashed
by government forces..."

36:43.320 --> 36:45.800
She's called Sarah.

36:45.840 --> 36:48.000
And she's perfect for me?
Apparently so.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.560
And she's perfect for me?
Apparently so.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.000
Let's try again.

36:56.000 --> 36:56.360
Let's try again.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.680
There's this girl you gotta meet.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.080
Jesus Christ.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.000
How many more times?

37:04.000 --> 37:05.760
How many more times?

37:07.960 --> 37:10.960
And this is George.
Hi!

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
I'm not sure that I love you
any more.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I'm not sure that I love you
any more.

37:16.360 --> 37:19.480
Her name's Sarah.

37:21.920 --> 37:24.000
We'll try again.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.040
Jesus fucking Christ!

37:26.080 --> 37:27.160
And again.

37:27.200 --> 37:28.000
And again.

37:28.000 --> 37:28.280
And again.

37:32.920 --> 37:36.000
Every time we get the opposition
to rise up against the government,

37:36.000 --> 37:36.760
Every time we get the opposition
to rise up against the government,

37:36.800 --> 37:39.360
the head of the prime minister's
private security force

37:39.400 --> 37:41.440
cracks down on them.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.000
Not every time. What?
There was one time they didn't.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.680
Not every time. What?
There was one time they didn't.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.080
When I got shot.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.000
What happened when I was killed,
Ross?

37:52.000 --> 37:53.760
What happened when I was killed,
Ross?

37:55.360 --> 37:58.760
Prime Minister Osiminov's security
chief died the same day you did.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.000
He slipped on some ice
and fell down the stairs.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.200
He slipped on some ice
and fell down the stairs.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.160
It was a freak accident.

38:03.200 --> 38:05.960
And without him leading the security
force? Puhvel got put into power,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
like we wanted.

38:08.000 --> 38:08.120
like we wanted.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.480
So, why did you reset
back to the checkpoint?

38:10.520 --> 38:14.640
You know why. It was the only way
to bring you back.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
You don't... You don't ever...

38:23.040 --> 38:24.000
Ever what? Save your life?

38:24.000 --> 38:25.840
Ever what? Save your life?

38:25.880 --> 38:28.920
I save your life every time I can
because I love you.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.880
That's what you do when you love
someone, you break rules for them.

38:31.920 --> 38:32.000
I didn't ask you to do that!
You didn't have to.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
I didn't ask you to do that!
You didn't have to.

38:34.040 --> 38:39.440
I'd give my life for this project!
You don't have to! Archie...

38:39.480 --> 38:40.000
Not while I'm here.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.960
Not while I'm here.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.320
The world needs you, Archie.

38:44.360 --> 38:47.800
Any version of the future without
you in it isn't one worth saving.

38:48.920 --> 38:51.320
We go kill the prime minister's
security chief,

38:51.360 --> 38:53.720
then we can complete the mission.

38:53.760 --> 38:55.280
We close the loop.

38:55.320 --> 38:56.000
We all get what we want.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.920
We all get what we want.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.000
Hey.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.320
I'm George.

39:45.360 --> 39:47.280
Sarah.

39:47.320 --> 39:50.400
Were you at that party?
Yeah.

39:50.440 --> 39:52.000
I think I saw you.

39:52.000 --> 39:52.040
I think I saw you.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.240
I think I saw you, too!

40:15.840 --> 40:16.000
Is this your bus stop?

40:16.000 --> 40:19.120
Is this your bus stop?

40:19.160 --> 40:20.880
Er...

40:20.920 --> 40:22.240
No.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.000
Do you wanna sit down, anyway?

40:24.000 --> 40:26.240
Do you wanna sit down, anyway?

40:27.280 --> 40:29.320
Mm. Yeah.

41:04.720 --> 41:08.080
You know, it's the weirdest thing,
I feel like I've met you before.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.160
''

41:30.360 --> 41:32.160
Hello?

41:38.480 --> 41:39.960
OK.

41:44.360 --> 41:47.720
I need to go to the hospital.

42:03.080 --> 42:06.000
I'm sorry, George.

42:06.040 --> 42:08.000
We did everything we could,
but we couldn't save her.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.760
We did everything we could,
but we couldn't save her.

42:12.920 --> 42:14.840
We have to try again!

42:14.880 --> 42:16.000
The opposition just took
the parliament building

42:16.000 --> 42:17.320
The opposition just took
the parliament building

42:17.360 --> 42:19.360
and the TV station.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.720
Our intelligence shows it worked.

42:21.760 --> 42:24.000
"No, Wes, please, no!
Wes, please, no! Please, Wes!"

42:24.000 --> 42:26.520
"No, Wes, please, no!
Wes, please, no! Please, Wes!"

42:26.560 --> 42:28.360
I'm sorry, Archie.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.400
Please, Wes, please! Wes!

42:31.440 --> 42:32.000
"Please, Wes!"
The mission was successful.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.160
"Please, Wes!"
The mission was successful.

42:39.680 --> 42:40.000
""

42:40.000 --> 42:41.720
""

42:41.760 --> 42:44.680
"Please, no!"

43:41.440 --> 43:44.000
You want to turn back time.

43:44.000 --> 43:44.760
You want to turn back time.

43:44.800 --> 43:46.120
Yes.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.760
Why?

43:47.800 --> 43:51.720
Because this version isn't right.
I don't want this version.

43:51.760 --> 43:52.000
I want to change it. I have to.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.360
I want to change it. I have to.

43:55.240 --> 43:57.440
You want to undo
what's already been done.

43:57.480 --> 44:00.000
It is what we do here, isn't it?

44:00.000 --> 44:00.720
It is what we do here, isn't it?

44:04.320 --> 44:07.080
Do you believe in fate?

44:07.120 --> 44:08.000
I don't know!

44:08.000 --> 44:09.240
I don't know!

44:12.240 --> 44:14.360
I don't care, I don't fucking care,

44:14.400 --> 44:16.000
if there were a thousand timelines
where we never met or we split up

44:16.000 --> 44:19.040
if there were a thousand timelines
where we never met or we split up

44:19.080 --> 44:20.360
or we lost everything.

44:20.400 --> 44:24.000
We're together now.
That's what I know.

44:24.000 --> 44:24.240
We're together now.
That's what I know.

44:24.280 --> 44:27.160
We're supposed to be together
cos that's the version we had.

44:27.200 --> 44:29.320
That's what was real.

44:30.320 --> 44:32.000
I can save her.

44:32.000 --> 44:32.320
I can save her.

44:32.360 --> 44:35.360
So, why the fuck wouldn't I?

44:36.720 --> 44:40.000
And are you willing to burn down
everything

44:40.000 --> 44:40.760
And are you willing to burn down
everything

44:40.800 --> 44:42.960
to start again?

44:58.440 --> 45:00.160
Yes.
