02:25.274 --> 02:30.254
Happy birthday, dear Homer

02:30.255 --> 02:34.955
Happy birthday to you!

02:34.956 --> 02:36.822
I don't have to make a wish,

02:36.823 --> 02:38.301
because I already have

02:38.302 --> 02:40.941
this wonderful family.

02:40.942 --> 02:42.747
I wish for infinity hamburgers.

02:45.917 --> 02:46.797
Huh?

02:51.859 --> 02:53.179
Oh, I get it.

02:53.185 --> 02:55.560
These are those trick candles

02:55.564 --> 02:57.281
you can't blow out.

02:57.283 --> 02:58.171
No, Dad,

02:58.171 --> 02:59.599
they're the
opposite.

02:59.599 --> 03:00.791
"E-Z BLO."

03:01.488 --> 03:03.433
This ends now.

03:12.886 --> 03:14.373
It's okay, Homie.

03:14.377 --> 03:16.053
You're probably just tired

03:16.065 --> 03:18.410
from not doing anything all day.

03:18.415 --> 03:19.560
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

03:19.566 --> 03:20.931
Dad, you're out of shape

03:20.937 --> 03:22.571
even for an American.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.340
I'll just focus on one area.

03:37.538 --> 03:38.932
How many did I get?

03:39.025 --> 03:40.921
None? That's cool.

03:59.147 --> 04:01.802
You know how many fires are started
by birthday candles?

04:01.806 --> 04:02.642
If you do, tell me.

04:02.645 --> 04:04.290
It would settle a bet down at the station house.

04:04.295 --> 04:06.002
I say five, Gus says a million.

04:07.287 --> 04:10.820
This disasterette was a real wake-up call.

04:10.827 --> 04:14.070
We need to find a way to protect our irreplaceables.

04:14.077 --> 04:16.043
You could buy a fireproof safe.

04:16.046 --> 04:17.262
Or we could just resolve

04:17.266 --> 04:19.351
to be more careful with our open flames.

04:19.357 --> 04:21.512
Sir, we've been here six times this month.

04:21.517 --> 04:25.740
Yeah, but, um, one of those,I dialed 9-1-1 by mistake,

04:25.757 --> 04:27.773
but I was too embarrassed to admit it,

04:27.777 --> 04:30.061
so I set the house on fire.

04:30.065 --> 04:31.702
Feels good to tell the truth.

04:31.796 --> 04:34.051
No, I'm lying again,it feels bad.

04:35.035 --> 04:36.091
Okay.

04:36.095 --> 04:38.402
Everyone gets to put one precious item

04:38.408 --> 04:40.261
in our fireproof safe.

04:40.268 --> 04:43.712
For me,it's the family photo album.

04:45.278 --> 04:46.283
Aw.

04:46.297 --> 04:48.882
Our kids used to be so cute.

04:48.885 --> 04:49.882
Used to?!

04:49.896 --> 04:51.170
Oh, deal with it.

04:51.635 --> 04:53.431
It's so hard to choose

04:53.437 --> 04:55.941
just one item worthy of the safe.

04:55.948 --> 04:58.580
So I made this elaborate decision tree,

04:58.585 --> 05:01.323
which in itself is worthy of preservation.

05:01.328 --> 05:02.782
Tick tock, sweetie.

05:02.796 --> 05:04.821
I picked my Malibu Stacyhybrid convertible.

05:04.827 --> 05:08.202
It runs on her old make up and out-of-style shoes.

05:08.207 --> 05:09.721
I'm going withthe cologne

05:09.735 --> 05:12.262
I wore on our first date.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.370
Ooh.

05:16.618 --> 05:19.170
I'm putting in my "Catch A Rising Krusty" doll!

05:22.247 --> 05:25.521
Where do the kids today get
these band names?

05:25.526 --> 05:26.472
"The Kinks?"

05:26.478 --> 05:27.391
"The Stones?"

05:27.397 --> 05:29.313
Sounds like my last physical!

05:30.776 --> 05:32.042
References.

05:33.045 --> 05:34.610
No. Wait. Don't...

05:35.685 --> 05:37.843
Now we have nothing to worry about

05:37.848 --> 05:41.131
in the event of a fire except our lives.

05:42.306 --> 05:44.633
You see all those crazy new electronics?

05:44.635 --> 05:46.602
iPod... iTunes...

05:46.608 --> 05:47.771
I give up!

05:55.595 --> 05:57.331
What's that coming out of the safe?

05:57.336 --> 06:00.091
I don't know-- maybe the Krusty doll accidentally turned on

06:00.095 --> 06:02.431
the car's headlight, which focused on the cologne bottle,

06:02.436 --> 06:04.313
causing it to boil,and soon explode.

06:04.315 --> 06:06.050
Dad, that's ridiculous.

06:08.817 --> 06:11.450
What's the deal with this "California pizza"?

06:11.455 --> 06:12.441
If I wanted...

06:12.447 --> 06:16.202
cheese and fruit, I'd have to...

06:21.806 --> 06:24.291
No!

06:24.798 --> 06:26.100
It's gone.

06:26.105 --> 06:30.590
That family album was a record of my accomplishments.

06:30.595 --> 06:33.763
It's like what a resume is for a man.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.093
I agree, Mom,it's very sad.

06:36.098 --> 06:37.770
But we'll have to move on.

06:37.788 --> 06:41.261
It's not like we can restage
all our family photos.

06:41.265 --> 06:44.030
Restage the photos?

06:44.038 --> 06:45.600
Lisa, you fool.

06:45.608 --> 06:47.250
You've doomed us all.

06:48.197 --> 06:49.683
No!

07:10.287 --> 07:14.322
Okay, we're recreating our series finale party

07:14.325 --> 07:16.872
for Star Trek: Voyager.

07:18.257 --> 07:20.630
Oh, man, I thought I was strong enough

07:20.636 --> 07:23.423
to get through this again,but I'm not.

07:25.536 --> 07:28.453
Oh, Captain Janeway!

07:28.457 --> 07:31.831
Your mission ended too soon.

07:32.045 --> 07:34.922
Too soon.

07:41.346 --> 07:43.892
Our new photos are back!

07:43.896 --> 07:44.982
Ooh!

07:47.755 --> 07:50.010
That's why I got duplicates.

07:50.016 --> 07:51.763
Restaged Precious Memories.

07:51.766 --> 07:54.621
Aw! There's my first saxophone recital.

07:54.626 --> 07:58.571
Bart looks so cute as a mighty oak in the school play.

07:58.576 --> 08:01.630
Here I am on the space shuttle,orbiting Earth.

08:01.636 --> 08:04.612
It sure was nice of NASA to send you up again.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.371
Oh, my God!

08:06.376 --> 08:09.482
Check out what's happening
behind your restaged anniversary dinner.

08:09.486 --> 08:11.902
Duffman's on a datewith Booberella.

08:11.906 --> 08:13.463
He's supposed to be

08:13.465 --> 08:15.320
in a stable, long-term gay relationship.

08:15.325 --> 08:16.273
Hmm.

08:16.278 --> 08:18.861
This is a celebrity scandal.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.431
We could sell that photo to a tabloid.

08:21.438 --> 08:24.141
And they pay big money for photos.

08:24.147 --> 08:26.262
Marge, this isn't like you.

08:26.266 --> 08:30.162
Well, it's just about what we need to pay for our fire damage.

08:30.286 --> 08:31.903
Spooky.

08:36.186 --> 08:37.602
This is good, real good.

08:37.607 --> 08:39.861
Like Lindsay Lohan looking drunk, high and bony.

08:39.868 --> 08:41.813
Click, click, career over,see ya in the gutter, freckles!

08:41.816 --> 08:43.371
Homer, I'll pay you 200 bucks.

08:43.378 --> 08:44.510
Bring me more snaps like this,

08:44.515 --> 08:46.111
and I'll make you a moderately wealthy man.

08:46.115 --> 08:48.250
Moderately wealthy?

08:49.267 --> 08:51.532
Whee! I'm sort of rich!

08:51.535 --> 08:54.300
I can rent anything I want!

08:54.398 --> 08:55.523
That's quite an offer.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.050
Can I discuss it with my wife?

08:57.055 --> 08:58.890
- Sure, why not?
- Then I'll do it!

09:01.028 --> 09:02.301
The Krusty Movie.
Premiering Tonight.

09:02.365 --> 09:05.981
Oh, boy ! I can't wait to see Krusty.

09:05.985 --> 09:08.541
Look, there's his chauffeur-driven Town Car.

09:11.138 --> 09:13.862
Your head dinged my door panel!

09:13.866 --> 09:16.121
Jerks like you ought to be shot!

09:16.128 --> 09:16.940
Krusty!

09:16.945 --> 09:19.511
How about a nice shot of you with the boy you injured?

09:19.518 --> 09:20.640
Paparazzi?!

09:20.645 --> 09:22.710
Get lost,ya parasite.

09:23.636 --> 09:24.983
How about you, Gabbo?

09:25.396 --> 09:27.713
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!

09:27.717 --> 09:30.321
Okay, how about an autograph for my kids?

09:30.328 --> 09:32.042
Well, when you put it that way...

09:32.045 --> 09:34.541
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi
yi-yi-yi-yi!

09:37.146 --> 09:39.842
Okay, boy, this is that snooty supermarket

09:39.845 --> 09:41.350
all the celebrities shop at.

09:41.404 --> 09:43.541
You're gonna helpme ambush them.

09:43.543 --> 09:45.448
Look at this place.

09:45.451 --> 09:47.209
Imported beer?

09:47.209 --> 09:48.943
Seedless grapes?

09:48.945 --> 09:50.861
Chewing gum?

09:51.545 --> 09:55.101
The clown on this cereal box
is just a person.

09:55.596 --> 09:56.822
There's the Rich Texan

09:56.856 --> 09:58.473
and his daughter,Paris Texan.

09:58.476 --> 10:00.913
Come on, baby, barf for mama.

10:00.915 --> 10:02.901
Okay, boy,do something annoying,

10:02.908 --> 10:05.491
but leave yourself room to build.

10:06.058 --> 10:08.090
Hey, Paris,I saw a disgusting

10:08.095 --> 10:09.890
part of your body on the Internet--

10:09.897 --> 10:10.713
your face!

10:10.717 --> 10:12.882
I'm still breaking in this nose!

10:17.257 --> 10:18.602
Springfield
Dry cleaners.

10:28.387 --> 10:30.171
Look at those celebrities.

10:30.175 --> 10:31.243
I've met them all,

10:31.246 --> 10:33.523
and yet they don't even acknowledge my existence.

10:33.528 --> 10:34.793
Hello, Homer.

10:34.795 --> 10:36.272
Have you lost weight?

10:36.277 --> 10:38.610
Oh, like you care,Betty White.

10:38.618 --> 10:40.083
Tell me,how's Maggie?

10:40.085 --> 10:41.991
Her name is Marge!

10:41.998 --> 10:43.791
I was talking about your baby.

10:43.797 --> 10:46.371
Oh. Uh, she's looking very... snappy!

10:46.407 --> 10:48.563
Thanks for taking my picture.

10:48.565 --> 10:49.881
If you want me to sign it,

10:49.886 --> 10:52.321
here's a stamped,self-addressed envelope.

10:52.328 --> 10:55.912
And give Santa's Little Helper a big hug for me.

10:56.298 --> 10:59.270
Yeah, that's right,just walk away.

11:02.956 --> 11:05.522
Beautiful day, isn't it, Freddie?
God bless you and yours.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.332
Dad, it's Drederick Tatum.

11:07.557 --> 11:08.690
Try to get him to punch you.

11:08.867 --> 11:09.870
No problem.

11:10.145 --> 11:11.321
Hey, Drederick!

11:11.918 --> 11:13.830
Yes, how can I help you,
my handsome friend?

11:13.946 --> 11:16.963
Your hip-hop CD was
boastful and unnecessary.

11:17.456 --> 11:18.551
Okay, here we go.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.361
That's what I think
of the forth estate!

11:34.855 --> 11:36.491
What are the first three?

11:36.646 --> 11:39.830
Nobility, clergy and commoners.
Learn your French history.

11:39.938 --> 11:40.822
Okay.

11:43.375 --> 11:44.442
Terrific! Outstanding!

11:44.586 --> 11:45.932
This has page one
written all over it.

11:46.118 --> 11:47.253
What the hell did you do that for ?

11:47.415 --> 11:49.713
I wanted to remember my place
in the book I was reading.

11:54.358 --> 11:57.191
Boy, I never thought
I'd have my own darkroom.

11:57.316 --> 12:00.193
Yes, but why does it
have to be in my bedroom ?

12:00.358 --> 12:02.403
Lis, you can't stay here
if you're gonna keep talking.

12:02.506 --> 12:04.990
It's 11:00 at night,
and I can't get to sleep!

12:05.308 --> 12:08.320
Well, then you could come over here
and help Daddy pour chemicals.

12:09.505 --> 12:10.640
Okay.

12:15.755 --> 12:18.220
Kids they always say
they're not tired

12:18.305 --> 12:20.251
when they're the most tired of all.

12:23.277 --> 12:24.453
That photo's mine.

12:24.816 --> 12:27.022
That photo's mine.
That photo's mine.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.212
Well, I do like the extra money.

12:29.356 --> 12:30.711
But I think maybe you should stop

12:30.877 --> 12:34.132
exploiting human beings'
private misfortunes.

12:34.357 --> 12:37.192
See, Marge everyone says
they hate these magazines,

12:37.318 --> 12:39.211
but it's impossible
to set them down.

12:39.337 --> 12:40.202
Oh, it is not.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.362
Watch me.

12:50.815 --> 12:53.081
Sideshow Mel is
in a custody battle ?!

12:53.918 --> 12:55.903
And it's turning bitter ?

12:56.027 --> 12:57.781
If you read one more thing,
it is a purchase.

12:57.906 --> 13:00.782
Experts disagree on
location of Heaven ?

13:00.848 --> 13:02.072
Purchase !

13:07.347 --> 13:08.881
Okay, this is the place.

13:13.486 --> 13:16.101
Did I attach the harness ?!

13:16.567 --> 13:17.362
No !

13:19.438 --> 13:21.262
Should attach it for you ?!

13:21.507 --> 13:24.531
If you don't mind...!

13:27.125 --> 13:28.340
Thank you !

13:29.736 --> 13:32.901
Now to make a young woman's
wedding day all about me.

13:34.735 --> 13:36.160
Do you, Rainier

13:36.257 --> 13:37.802
Luftwaffe Wolfcastle,

13:37.955 --> 13:40.383
take Maria Shriver-Kennedy-Quimby

13:40.518 --> 13:44.221
- to be your lawful wedded...
- Up, up,and annoy!

13:44.335 --> 13:45.342
Yes !

13:46.735 --> 13:48.143
I also wreck bar mitzvahs !

13:49.785 --> 13:52.433
Is that horrible man gone yet ?

13:52.628 --> 13:56.052
Yes, Mother, barring some sort
of pendulum effect.

13:58.288 --> 14:00.413
First Amendment rules,
privacy drools !

14:03.048 --> 14:05.442
Time to squash that shutterbug.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.483
You promised me one day

14:07.568 --> 14:09.532
where you wouldn't
swear revenge on someone.

14:09.868 --> 14:11.611
Promise revoked.

14:13.297 --> 14:16.553
Greetings, famous faces
and sizzling stars.

14:18.638 --> 14:21.072
Thank you for responding
to my e-vite.

14:21.336 --> 14:24.202
Krusty, your response
was the least funny.

14:24.417 --> 14:26.261
I'm a visual comedian.

14:26.335 --> 14:27.752
Did you get the j-peg ?

14:27.886 --> 14:29.342
- Wouldn't open.
- Oh!

14:29.535 --> 14:31.572
I wish to discuss
our mutual enemy,

14:31.655 --> 14:32.540
Homer Simpson.

14:34.095 --> 14:35.220
Now, do not worry.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.223
In my film A Future Droid
in King Arthur's Court,

14:38.456 --> 14:40.520
I learned
that it takes a Robo Knight

14:40.647 --> 14:41.962
to defeat a Robo Knight.

14:42.987 --> 14:44.801
And to defeat a paparazzo,

14:44.977 --> 14:46.092
it takes this man!

14:49.376 --> 14:53.160
Let me introduce the world's
greatest celebrity shutterbug

14:53.415 --> 14:55.542
Enrico Irritazio.

14:55.695 --> 14:56.901
Buono giorno!

14:57.528 --> 15:00.133
How are you gonna
help us, Beefaroni ?

15:00.298 --> 15:01.782
Allow me to explain.

15:02.115 --> 15:05.240
I take embarrassing
pictures of Homer,

15:05.606 --> 15:09.180
harass him day and night.
Justice will be served,

15:09.425 --> 15:11.661
and I will be a god in your eyes!

15:13.606 --> 15:15.173
See ?
It is good.

15:15.346 --> 15:16.930
I declare this meeting adjourned.

15:17.097 --> 15:18.551
Now please, take some sushi,

15:18.665 --> 15:20.491
'cause if I give it to the dogs,
they will think,

15:20.605 --> 15:22.363
"Oh, now I get sushi all the time."

15:22.655 --> 15:25.833
And I am not made of sushi.

15:28.108 --> 15:29.831
Now, Maggie, I had
to use your car seat

15:29.947 --> 15:31.301
to hold the new TV Guide...

15:32.675 --> 15:34.562
so I'm gonna hang
you from the mirror.

15:44.725 --> 15:45.731
Smile !

15:47.467 --> 15:49.910
He's trying to make me
look like a bad father.

15:50.065 --> 15:51.100
Maggie, take the wheel !

15:53.056 --> 15:54.650
Ten and two, Einstein !

15:59.237 --> 16:01.223
Can't I even have privacy here ?!

16:11.958 --> 16:13.413
Scandalous!
Repugnant!

16:13.506 --> 16:14.623
<i>Ausgezeichnet !</i>

16:14.748 --> 16:19.363
I shall make this photo
into my screensaver !

16:19.607 --> 16:20.483
Somehow.

16:20.767 --> 16:22.492
How could you publish this?

16:22.715 --> 16:23.952
I thought we were friends!

16:24.095 --> 16:25.433
I have no friends.
Friends take time.

16:25.588 --> 16:26.932
And time is money,
and money pays for things,

16:27.057 --> 16:28.252
like a manicure
and a boiled egg.

16:28.357 --> 16:29.823
Get me one of each,
but not boiled, poached.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.160
Ah, what the hell
it's Friday, scrambled !

16:31.297 --> 16:34.181
Sometimes I wish I had a twin.
Not that much, though. We'd just fight.

16:34.757 --> 16:37.091
And then he said
he didn't want a twin

16:37.416 --> 16:38.992
because they'd just fight.

16:39.156 --> 16:42.843
Sweetie, maybe it's time
you retired from paparazzying.

16:42.948 --> 16:46.242
It's never fun to get a taste
of your own medicine.

16:46.456 --> 16:48.762
You're right.
I'm giving up photography...

16:48.867 --> 16:50.203
and my own medicine !

16:50.355 --> 16:52.291
So long, anti-clotting agent !

16:53.198 --> 16:55.303
Clot, clot, clot, clot
clot, clot, clot, clot !

17:00.355 --> 17:02.083
With Homer Simpson
out of the way,

17:02.417 --> 17:05.751
we can go back to our lives
of sybaritic excess.

17:05.905 --> 17:07.042
Stem cell fajita ?

17:07.346 --> 17:08.242
Leave the tray.

17:18.595 --> 17:19.681
Listen to 'em.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.079
They're on top of the world

17:21.137 --> 17:23.862
while I'm sittin' here
pretending I have a stool.

17:24.257 --> 17:26.880
All because of a bunch
of stuff that happened.

17:27.258 --> 17:30.692
Homer, don't be so quick
to abandon this paparazzo thing.

17:30.856 --> 17:33.370
Yeah, it's an American tradition
to cut people down to size

17:33.486 --> 17:35.763
because they've brought
so much joy into our lives.

17:35.938 --> 17:38.600
You know who I can't stand ?
That Robin Williams.

17:38.695 --> 17:41.420
You know, one time I saw him
eating dinner with his children.

17:41.548 --> 17:42.920
He wouldn't take the time out

17:43.016 --> 17:45.071
to do all the funny bits
from his movies.

17:45.167 --> 17:47.391
And my sister once saw
Burt Reynolds at an airport,

17:47.586 --> 17:49.540
and he wouldn't even
cosign her mortgage.

17:49.768 --> 17:52.271
You guys are right
I should get back in the game.

17:52.387 --> 17:54.230
Oh ! But I threw away my camera.

17:54.436 --> 17:55.423
Oh, here, use this one.

17:55.547 --> 17:57.361
I was gonna use it
to take secret photos

17:57.447 --> 17:59.012
in the ladies'
toilet, but, uh,

17:59.155 --> 18:00.732
no dames ever come in this joint.

18:00.945 --> 18:02.482
- Thanks, Moe!
- Sure.

18:06.378 --> 18:08.481
Excuse me, do you have
a ladies' room?

18:08.736 --> 18:10.753
We need to trade bras and panties.

18:11.555 --> 18:13.031
Oh, you got to be kidding me!

18:26.075 --> 18:27.441
You call this a drink?

18:27.756 --> 18:29.411
No, I never called it a drink.

18:30.966 --> 18:33.122
How do you want
your comeuppance

18:33.485 --> 18:36.603
eight by ten or wallet size?

18:36.876 --> 18:38.740
Celebrities, hide your shame!

18:59.867 --> 19:02.530
What are you going to
do with those photos?

19:03.966 --> 19:04.803
Nothing.

19:05.736 --> 19:08.232
Providing you celebrities
do something for me.

19:08.807 --> 19:11.202
I want you all to show some respect

19:11.317 --> 19:13.083
for the people
who made you what you are.

19:13.255 --> 19:14.772
Sign an autograph or two.

19:14.955 --> 19:16.330
Support a charity for something

19:16.388 --> 19:18.780
that hasn't happened
to a member of your family.

19:18.908 --> 19:23.251
Let one of us regular guys write
a terrible children's book!

19:23.697 --> 19:25.153
We will take the deal.

19:25.568 --> 19:26.821
As a sign of good faith,

19:27.098 --> 19:28.383
I invite you and your family

19:28.505 --> 19:30.743
to a barbecue on my
offshore party platform.

19:38.728 --> 19:42.110
It is good doing real things
with real people.

19:42.317 --> 19:45.010
Say, Rainier,
you're in show business.

19:45.247 --> 19:48.053
Would you mind taking a look
at this screenplay I wrote?

19:48.906 --> 19:53.371
Oh, sorry.
I do not read unsolicited manuscripts.

20:01.595 --> 20:04.063
Well, at least it got made.

20:04.297 --> 20:06.960
