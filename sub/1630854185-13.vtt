00:03.837 --> 00:05.406
<i>Previously on</i> CSI: Vegas...

00:05.506 --> 00:07.208
<i>Folsom and I
found an old dossier</i>

00:07.308 --> 00:09.243
along with this note.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.344
<i>Dr. Auerbach.</i>

00:10.444 --> 00:11.845
You think this one little doodle

00:11.945 --> 00:13.747
<i>means that she's behind
all these killings?</i>

00:13.847 --> 00:16.650
Didn't she say whoever's behind
this might be playing games?

00:16.750 --> 00:18.052
<i>Maybe that's exactly
what she's doing.</i>

00:18.152 --> 00:20.020
Lynn Zobrist
and another victim Lamont Moore,

00:20.121 --> 00:22.022
<i>they all have scars
on their temples.</i>

00:22.123 --> 00:23.991
Maybe the other victims
have suffered

00:24.092 --> 00:26.494
some serious
psychiatric problems, too.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.497
I spent some time in a facility.

00:29.597 --> 00:30.564
There were
mirrors there?

00:30.664 --> 00:32.533
There were mirrors everywhere.

00:32.633 --> 00:33.734
I'm not going back

00:33.834 --> 00:35.002
in the field.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.537
I'm either in the lab
or I'm nowhere.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.448
All right now.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.682
Shake, shake, shake.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.285
Take those lights off. Yup.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.053
I think we're getting it.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.355
I don't think
we're getting it

00:54.455 --> 00:55.889
until we've, you
know, struck gold.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.358
Now remember,

00:57.458 --> 00:58.759
you're looking
for the black sand.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.928
'Cause that's
where the gold be.

01:01.028 --> 01:04.031
Well, I, for one,
am having a lot of fun

01:04.132 --> 01:05.433
on our little adventure.

01:05.533 --> 01:06.667
A day at the pool
can be an adventure.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.869
A beautiful,
air-conditioned restaurant.

01:08.969 --> 01:10.037
Cirque du Soleil.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.341
Billy and I are having fun.
Aren't we, Billy?

01:14.275 --> 01:15.909
Sure.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.258
Excuse me, miss.

01:30.358 --> 01:32.793
This area
isn't safe.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.795
There was a flood
here yesterday.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.130
The ground is
very soft and can...

01:45.005 --> 01:46.507
Right this way, guys.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.908
Bodies are just up here.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.477
Then why'd we have
to park way back there?

01:49.577 --> 01:50.511
Do you know how far I've
had to carry this thing?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.079
Really far.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.248
Really,
really far.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.617
Really?

01:58.552 --> 02:00.621
Well...

02:00.721 --> 02:06.026
It looks like our bodies
are more like one body

02:06.126 --> 02:07.528
and two skulls.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.062
Most of one body.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.798
Left leg's been severed
just below the patella.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.866
We got different
rates of decomp here.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.001
Look.

02:14.101 --> 02:15.469
There's still some
skin on this fellow,

02:15.569 --> 02:16.637
whereas here...

02:16.737 --> 02:18.672
She's nothing but bone.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.642
Maybe the coyotes found
her especially tasty?

02:21.742 --> 02:24.578
"She"? "Her"? How can you tell?

02:24.678 --> 02:26.414
Well, just a guess based
on the cranial vault.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.516
Forehead angle is vertical,

02:28.616 --> 02:29.883
not receding,

02:29.983 --> 02:32.119
and the supraorbital
margin is sharp, suggests

02:32.220 --> 02:33.487
sex is likely female.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.723
Late teens, early 20s.

02:39.993 --> 02:40.961
You okay?

02:41.061 --> 02:42.830
Yeah.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.635
Okay, jackpot.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.670
Gentleman
with the missing leg is...

02:49.770 --> 02:51.472
Harrison Cantwell.

02:51.572 --> 02:52.473
Okay if we roll him?

02:52.573 --> 02:54.041
Yeah, go ahead.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.544
Whoa, hold on.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.145
Got some kind
of stone here.

02:58.246 --> 03:00.013
Looks like he got
it in the chest a few times

03:00.113 --> 03:02.182
before they stabbed
him in the eye. Oh.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.886
These guys like to hide

03:05.986 --> 03:07.421
in bodies that have been
out for a while.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.089
The bluebottle
flies come and go.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.526
And then the coffin
flies have their turn.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.027
And then beetles.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.397
And tarantulas.
Yeah, tarantulas
eat the beetles.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.332
So this guy's been missing...

03:18.432 --> 03:20.000
40, maybe 50 days.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.335
Yeah.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.170
Wonder where
they came from.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.753
All right, Penny.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.154
What do you see?
No presumptions,

03:41.255 --> 03:42.623
no guesses.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.425
Come on.
I need space, I need space!

03:44.525 --> 03:46.260
I don't want you
reading my thoughts!

03:46.360 --> 03:47.961
I'm having
a hard time focusing

03:48.061 --> 03:49.497
on what I see
because what I hear

03:49.597 --> 03:50.898
from over there is
really distracting.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.433
You're listening
to my thoughts.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.535
You're
making me sick.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.437
Penny, look at
me. Look at me.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.671
Tune it out.

03:57.771 --> 03:58.806
What do you see?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.841
Okay, this guy
drove up in a hurry.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.110
He blocked the
homeowner's car in.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.781
Brought his gun
to the front door.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.518
<i>But when the homeowner
Molly Tate opened it,</i>

04:10.618 --> 04:12.820
<i>she was armed, too.</i>

04:12.920 --> 04:14.655
She fired three bullets.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.124
They struck him
in his chest.

04:17.224 --> 04:18.692
Backspatter and expiratory

04:18.792 --> 04:21.228
on his closed fingers
and the gun suggest that

04:21.329 --> 04:22.896
he was holding his gun up,

04:22.996 --> 04:24.732
aiming at her.
Mm-hmm.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.199
Till boom, boom, boom,

04:26.300 --> 04:28.336
he falls back,
collapses and dies.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.970
It looks like
self-defense.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.639
Yep. Well
spotted, I agree.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.941
Ms. Tate's self-defense
story holds up.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.108
Uh, Antonia?

04:35.208 --> 04:36.377
I want to go back inside,

04:36.477 --> 04:38.379
I don't want you listening
to my mind.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.713
Wait, wait, wait, stop.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.449
That scar on
your temple.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.784
Did you get any
of your therapy

04:43.884 --> 04:45.753
in a mirrored room?

04:45.853 --> 04:47.187
How could you know that?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.188
Have you been

04:48.288 --> 04:49.256
in my mind?

04:49.357 --> 04:50.858
Have you? Has she?

04:50.958 --> 04:51.692
Has she?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.627
Has she? Get off me.

04:55.496 --> 04:58.098
We've got to check
this dead man's car.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.600
Now.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.569
Ooh.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.652
This scene is all kinds
of bad news.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.220
Definitely.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.223
Am I, uh, clear to
remove this here?

05:23.323 --> 05:24.257
Yep.

05:26.093 --> 05:26.894
Hey.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.396
Did I miss all the fun?

05:28.496 --> 05:30.163
Is that a spearhead?

05:30.263 --> 05:32.232
Wait, do we need to contact
the Bureau of Indian Affairs?

05:32.332 --> 05:35.102
Uh, no, I don't think
they have jurisdiction.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.470
This isn't Shoshone,

05:36.570 --> 05:39.272
Paiute or Washoe.
This is something much older.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.408
It's a Clovis point.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.509
They date back like

05:41.609 --> 05:42.376
12,000 years ago.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.544
End of the Ice Age.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.978
Am I crazy,

05:45.078 --> 05:46.480
or does this look
like a type match

05:46.580 --> 05:47.615
to the other skull?

05:47.715 --> 05:49.483
It might be an age match, too.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.885
The wear on the bone,
the teeth...

05:51.985 --> 05:55.155
I mean, we'll need radiocarbon
dating to confirm, but

05:55.255 --> 05:56.490
it's possible this skull

05:56.590 --> 05:58.291
dates back that far, too.

05:58.392 --> 05:59.427
Okay, what are we saying?

05:59.527 --> 06:01.128
I think we're saying...

06:01.228 --> 06:03.764
these two lovebirds were killed
with the same murder weapon

06:03.864 --> 06:06.233
12,000 years apart.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.679

06:43.637 --> 06:45.439
So, we got
a new dead body

06:45.539 --> 06:49.276
and an ancient skull.

06:49.376 --> 06:52.245
Listen, Cantwell's
fingers were curled inside

06:52.345 --> 06:53.947
the skull's
occipital opening.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.783
And rigor set in, just...

06:55.883 --> 06:57.485
He was locked on tight.

06:57.585 --> 06:58.752
Yeah.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.421
Like an action figure
with a kung fu grip.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.791
So, he holds on all
the way downriver,

07:03.891 --> 07:05.192
but...

07:05.292 --> 07:06.827
Wondering
where he came from?
Yeah.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.162
He could have floated
quite a ways.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.631
W-We got a heavy
rain last night.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.701
This watershed is very prone
to flash-flooding,

07:13.801 --> 07:15.569
especially in
the middle of this

07:15.669 --> 07:16.870
drought season
that we're having.

07:16.970 --> 07:17.905
Is that right?

07:18.005 --> 07:19.372
My-my point is,

07:19.473 --> 07:21.842
he didn't get killed at
Flash in the Pan Tours and...

07:21.942 --> 07:23.210
Well, maybe she can

07:23.310 --> 07:24.344
pass that along to any

07:24.444 --> 07:25.746
reporters who
might be wondering.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.815
Okay, Mr. Jakes. Thanks.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.282
You can go.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.651
All right, so I
did some googling

07:30.751 --> 07:32.085
on our victim
Harrison Cantwell.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.187
Apparently, he was some sort of

07:34.287 --> 07:35.923
amateur archaeologist
turned author.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.191
Well liked, did a lot
of philanthropic work

07:38.291 --> 07:40.127
<i>for museums around the world.</i>

07:40.227 --> 07:42.329
Semi-famous in nerdy circles.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.297
Oi. I've heard of him.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.198
Yeah.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.233
Now, he's from New York,

07:46.333 --> 07:47.935
but he's got
an honorary seat

07:48.035 --> 07:50.604
on the board of the Natural
History Museum of Clark County.

07:50.704 --> 07:51.939
Maybe that's what
brought him out here?

07:52.039 --> 07:53.306
Well, I was
heading there next

07:53.406 --> 07:54.608
anyway. They have the equipment

07:54.708 --> 07:56.443
I need to
carbon-date the skull.

07:56.544 --> 07:59.279
So, you-- the body
and the murder weapon.

07:59.379 --> 08:00.614
You-- the ancient skull.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.749
And another thing.
Come here a minute.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.584
That 419 this morning?
Mm-hmm.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.253
In the dead
man's trunk

08:06.353 --> 08:08.956
was a card written
in silver ink.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.625
"Keep your secrets.
Cull the rotten fruit"?

08:11.725 --> 08:12.793
It seems like

08:12.893 --> 08:13.961
he was sent to kill
this young woman

08:14.061 --> 08:15.195
and she wasn't having it.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.697
Then this would-be victim,

08:16.797 --> 08:19.933
she could be another link
in the chain.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.302
I need to talk to her
as soon as possible. No.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.304
We need to walk and chew gum
at the same time.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.640
I will stay on your
silver ink case

08:26.740 --> 08:28.175
'cause I need
your expertise on this

08:28.275 --> 08:29.610
ancient skull business.

08:29.710 --> 08:30.544
Thank you.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.779
All right, y'all.
Come on.

08:32.613 --> 08:35.683
More than an author.
He was so charitable.

08:35.783 --> 08:39.620
So kind. Like a brother to
all of us here at the museum.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.789
Are you sure it's him?

08:41.889 --> 08:42.623
Wow.

08:42.723 --> 08:43.991
You all seem surprised.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.626
But from what we can tell,
he must've been missing

08:45.726 --> 08:47.060
for close
to two months.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.529
Cantwell wasn't a traditional
scientist per se,

08:49.630 --> 08:50.664
but he was passionate.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.532
He immersed himself in research.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.334
Before his last
three books, he went off-grid.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.369
Five, six months.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.705
Embedding, searching.

08:57.805 --> 09:00.473
No one ever thought
anything of it.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.843
Zimbabwe, the Yucatán.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.145
This last time,
he was looking for

09:05.245 --> 09:06.346
Clovis artifacts

09:06.446 --> 09:07.948
<i>in the Basin and Range.</i>

09:08.048 --> 09:10.150
Well, he might have found more
than just artifacts.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.719
Um, there was a Clovis point,

09:11.819 --> 09:13.721
a murder weapon that
we took back to the lab.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.255
But there was
something else.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.824
Here, have a look
for yourself.

09:18.959 --> 09:19.960
What in the world?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.529
Tad, run and get
my hand lenses.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.165
Do you think it's possible?

09:25.265 --> 09:26.867
That this is a Clovis skull?

09:26.967 --> 09:29.236
It-it would be
the find of the decade.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.403
Wear on the bone,

09:30.503 --> 09:32.673
the teeth,
it certainly could be.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.241
MacARTHUR:
We have so few

09:34.341 --> 09:37.544
links to the oldest humans
to walk on this continent.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.112
Someone has to
write this up.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.015
It should really be you.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.451
Perhaps Tad can assist.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.553
For now, I'm
assisting. We need it.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.555
It's part of a homicide investigation.

09:48.656 --> 09:51.124
Our lab can handle
tool mark analysis

09:51.224 --> 09:52.492
on the Clovis
point, but

09:52.592 --> 09:53.794
do you happen to have

09:53.894 --> 09:55.929
a, um, accelerator
mass spectrometer

09:56.029 --> 09:57.097
for carbon-14 dating?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.165
Mm-hmm.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.733
Do you mind if I play with it?

09:59.833 --> 10:02.435
We're trying to find out
if she and your friend

10:02.535 --> 10:05.038
were killed by
the same weapon.

10:22.656 --> 10:23.556
River was
beautiful this morning.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.826
Sun was shining. Here?

10:25.926 --> 10:27.728
And you probably saw

10:27.828 --> 10:30.030
the pictures, but it really
does not do it justice.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.932
This?
Yeah, that, too.

10:32.032 --> 10:32.966
I mean...

10:33.066 --> 10:35.002
the lab is
great. There.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.536
But, uh...

10:36.636 --> 10:37.938
field work is
great, too, man.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.040
I just wish you
could've been there, man.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.543
I'm a lab rat, you know,
now and forever.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.312
11 points of minutia
on the Clovis point.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.479
11 matching points

10:46.579 --> 10:47.547
on the defect
in the skull.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.448
They-they measure out

10:48.548 --> 10:49.516
perfectly.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.118
Yeah, it's a match. Yeah.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.853
Looks like there's some little
fragments from the arrowhead

10:52.953 --> 10:55.355
that were broken off
in the skull itself.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.857
No weathering on
the broken edges

10:56.957 --> 10:58.391
means it was probably
pulled out recently.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.661
Like,
maybe right before the attack.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.764
What if this is what
they're fighting about?

11:03.864 --> 11:05.966
I mean, it could be, they know
the value of these artifacts,

11:06.066 --> 11:08.101
I mean, if they're as old
as Allie thinks they are.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.436
Oh, they are.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.271
Radiocarbon dating
says this skull

11:11.371 --> 11:15.242
is 12,245 years old.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.409
Give or take.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.678
We're talking 10,000 BC? Wow.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.113
That's older than agriculture.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.581
I know.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.683
So, Harrison Cantwell
managed to find a skull

11:23.784 --> 11:26.086
that had been hidden from
humanity for 12,000 years.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.022
Wherever he found it, that's
got to be our crime scene.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.390
Yeah, it's taken since
the end of the Ice Age

11:30.490 --> 11:32.092
for someone to find it.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.762
Yeah, well, I'm sure we'll have
it sorted by lunchtime tomorrow.

11:35.896 --> 11:39.132
Okay, okay. Okay,
okay, okay, goodbye, Sonya.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.368
No, you are. Mom agrees.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.303
Yeah, kisses.

11:44.604 --> 11:47.040
Hey, Jack, is your
sister out of town?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.641
She's in London
presenting a paper.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.010
"Sudden Death and
Fibromuscular Dysplasia

11:50.110 --> 11:51.378
of the Mesenteric
Arteries."

11:51.478 --> 11:52.379
I've seen her slides.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.781
They're really funny.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.682
You knew about this?
Yeah.

11:55.783 --> 11:56.616
She asked me for kebab recommendations.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.185
Don't worry.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.920
We FaceTimed our way through
a very thorough intake.

12:00.020 --> 12:00.788
Mm.

12:00.888 --> 12:01.822
Ready for the highlights?

12:01.922 --> 12:02.990
Our victim was stabbed

12:03.090 --> 12:05.492
five times using
a stone object.

12:05.592 --> 12:06.860
Probably held in the hands,
not a spear.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.395
The wounds are
too shallow.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.097
The final stab into his eye
isn't what killed him.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.800
This wound, in the
inferoanterior cardiac muscle

12:12.900 --> 12:15.068
near the right ventricle, caused
a hemorrhage into the torso.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.607
Broken bones in
the arms and jaw

12:20.707 --> 12:22.109
suggest fistfight.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.744
Broken carpals and metacarpals.
He fought back.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.046
And what about the leg?

12:26.146 --> 12:27.380
Uh, leg.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.082
Jack?
Ah!

12:29.182 --> 12:31.418
Right. If you look at the
position of the cartilage,

12:31.518 --> 12:32.452
definitely postmortem.

12:32.552 --> 12:33.821
My guess is some kind of animal,

12:33.921 --> 12:36.156
like a coyote, tugged at it

12:36.256 --> 12:37.791
till it was torn off.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.994
What about this?

12:42.529 --> 12:44.097
Huh.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.034
Looks like... sand?

12:47.134 --> 12:48.802
Maybe? Stuck to
the hardened earwax?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.037
There's quite a bit of it,

12:50.137 --> 12:51.371
especially...

12:51.471 --> 12:54.107
given the advanced
state of decomposition.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.142
Meaning what?

12:55.242 --> 12:56.476
I don't know yet.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.745
But this kind of
eluvium might tell us

12:58.846 --> 13:00.814
where Cantwell was
before he was killed.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.550
I don't want you
pulling thoughts out of my head.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.718
You're scaring me.
But, Molly,

13:05.819 --> 13:07.420
you're not being charged.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.889
We know you acted
in self-defense.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.624
Your doorbell camera,
it got the whole thing.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.293
Then why am I here?

13:13.393 --> 13:14.594
You trying to put

13:14.694 --> 13:16.229
things in my mind? Hmm?
No, we...

13:16.329 --> 13:17.965
we can't put things
in your head.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.499
We just want to ask
you some questions

13:19.599 --> 13:21.334
to help keep you safe.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.702
I told the cops.

13:22.802 --> 13:23.770
I'm not going into...

13:23.871 --> 13:25.305
protective whatever. I'm fine.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.874
But whoever came
to your house,

13:26.974 --> 13:31.278
they came with a specific
intention to kill you, Molly.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.847
Do you know why?

13:33.947 --> 13:34.848
No.

13:34.948 --> 13:35.949
I don't.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.018
I don't have
any idea.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.353
For all I know, it was you.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.656
I know this is very hard.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.025
But we have to talk about this

13:45.125 --> 13:46.860
because we don't
think it's over.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.096
Wait, what are you...?
Just listen.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.530
There have been
a number of

13:50.630 --> 13:53.066
recent crimes.
And in every case,

13:53.166 --> 13:54.868
the people who were
being targeted

13:54.968 --> 13:56.203
were being encouraged

13:56.303 --> 13:58.271
to kill someone else.

13:59.639 --> 14:00.707
You got a card.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.375
Just like this, Molly.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.278
Didn't you?
No.

14:05.378 --> 14:06.479
I didn't.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.814
I didn't!

14:07.915 --> 14:09.616
You two are listening
to my thoughts.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.418
Which I asked you very clearly

14:11.518 --> 14:13.086
not to do. Molly.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.721
We cannot listen
to your thoughts.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.523
You got a card,

14:16.623 --> 14:18.225
and it came
with a dossier.

14:18.325 --> 14:19.526
Blackmail.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.195
You were being asked
to kill someone.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.999
We're just trying
to keep 'em safe.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.734
That dossier

14:27.834 --> 14:29.769
could tell us who's behind this.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.273
I don't want to be here.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.707
Am I free to go?

14:35.608 --> 14:37.310
Am I?

14:39.646 --> 14:41.681
Yes, of course.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.021
Listening to her damn thoughts.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.390
If I could hear
her damn thoughts,

14:50.490 --> 14:51.925
this case would be over by now.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.127
That's thought broadcasting
and thought insertion.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.595
They're common delusions
for people

14:55.695 --> 14:57.164
with schizoaffective disorder.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.433
If we're gonna learn anything
about who sent this card,

15:00.533 --> 15:03.103
it's gonna be from this card.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.480
Okay, remind me again
what we're doing out here?

15:13.580 --> 15:14.847
This is fun.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.716
Admit it.
Come on.

15:16.816 --> 15:18.551
No. Fun is tequila shots

15:18.651 --> 15:20.120
and blowtorch queso.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.288
This is...

15:21.388 --> 15:24.357
Dude, this is
<i>Duck Dynasty.</i>

15:25.525 --> 15:26.893
Let's just get
this over with

15:26.994 --> 15:28.428
so we can get back
to civilization.
Okay, look.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.698
So, this is where our
victim washed up, right?

15:31.798 --> 15:33.166
But it's not
where he died.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.701
So, if we're gonna find
what happened to him,

15:34.801 --> 15:35.502
we're gonna have to
retrace his steps.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.636
Retrace his float.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.871
All right, so...

15:38.972 --> 15:40.240
Guy was on dry
land for weeks.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.641
Long enough for
those spiders

15:41.741 --> 15:43.710
to take up residency
in his torso.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.246
Then the rain came
and brought him here.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.981
But it was only raining
about four hours, so...

15:48.081 --> 15:50.717
How far does a guy float
in about four hours?

15:50.817 --> 15:53.053
You know, I have a
tool that can tell us.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.755
He's a very
specialized CSI.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.329
Ready, Folsom?
Let it rip.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.365
All right, ready?

16:10.970 --> 16:15.208
Okay, so most objects on
the river move at the same rate.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.744
The increased flowrate
after last night's rain--

16:17.844 --> 16:20.747
we'll call it 1.6
to two miles per hour.

16:20.847 --> 16:22.649
The body
must've floated...

16:22.749 --> 16:24.784
six and a half
to eight miles.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.553
I'm not walking that.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.190
Don't worry, me neither.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.339
This is six and
a half miles.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.707
Whoa, hold on...

16:47.807 --> 16:49.809
Is that...?

16:49.909 --> 16:51.444
A shoe?

16:53.680 --> 16:57.016
Well, this
isn't great.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.219
No blood.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.255
There's no signs
of struggle, either.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.091
Hey.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.559
I found our tibia.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.297
So, this must be the spot
where our victim's body lay

17:10.397 --> 17:13.166
all that time before the flash
flood washed him downriver.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.536
But this isn't a murder
scene, this is just...

17:16.636 --> 17:18.305
A shoe and half a leg.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.339
Okay...

17:19.439 --> 17:20.373
if this isn't where

17:20.473 --> 17:21.941
the murder actually happened...

17:22.909 --> 17:25.245
...how the hell are we going
to find the crime scene now?

17:40.293 --> 17:41.728
Okay, so, uh...

17:41.828 --> 17:44.831
Cantwell makes this big-deal
archaeological find somewhere

17:44.931 --> 17:46.633
in this valley, then...

17:46.733 --> 17:48.901
gets stabbed
and winds up here.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.504
Well, he was either dragged
here by his killer...

17:51.604 --> 17:53.706
Or he limped out here
under his own power

17:53.806 --> 17:55.142
when he had both his legs.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.743
Either way,

17:56.843 --> 17:58.611
desperately holding on
to that skull.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.381
Well, it sounds like
for an archaeologist,

18:01.481 --> 18:02.849
this would be a
career-defining find.

18:02.949 --> 18:06.119
Anyway, there's-there's
still one silver lining.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.454
What's that?

18:07.554 --> 18:08.388
Well, this isn't the
first time I've found

18:08.488 --> 18:09.789
two skulls at a scene.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.424
But it is the first
time I've only been on

18:11.524 --> 18:13.426
the hook to solve the
murder of one of them.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.565
Is there something about
this case that's bothering you?

18:18.665 --> 18:21.168
No, let's just go solve it.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.969
Okay, let's...

18:23.770 --> 18:26.373
We need to keeping
searching this area.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.919
Aw.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.423
Oh, she's been out here
for a few days.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.658
Why would somebody shoot her?

18:45.758 --> 18:47.160
Well...

18:48.861 --> 18:50.963
Maybe they saw she had
a person's leg in her mouth

18:51.063 --> 18:52.832
and they thought
they might be next. Ugh.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.001
I think this must be
Cantwell's foot.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.537
She's got a collar.
That's weird.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.105
GPS tracker.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.607
Tagged wildlife.

19:00.707 --> 19:03.176
Biologists use these
to track migration patterns.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.044
If the coyote picked up
Cantwell's blood trail

19:05.144 --> 19:06.913
at the crime scene
and followed it here...

19:07.013 --> 19:08.915
Then this little gizmo might
lead us to where he died.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.589
Stick with me because we've got
a lot of trains running.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.791
First, we've got these
postcards. This one

19:18.891 --> 19:20.960
was in Alan Herskovitz's house,

19:21.060 --> 19:23.196
in that first case that
kicked off this whole mess.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.365
This one was sent
to us last week.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.799
Then we have
these cards.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.835
Same card-stock,
same metallic ink.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.537
The only DNA
and fingerprints

19:30.637 --> 19:32.004
we found on the ones
from yesterday

19:32.104 --> 19:33.806
are from Lukas Tremaine,
the man that Molly killed.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.575
But none from whoever sent them.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.176
What I
don't get is

19:37.277 --> 19:40.146
why write these out by hand
and then print these out?

19:40.247 --> 19:41.248
What is that about?

19:41.348 --> 19:42.549
Maybe his computer doesn't have

19:42.649 --> 19:43.916
his favorite
"Wacky Scribbles" font.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.254
I always go with
"ancient alien hieroglyphics"

19:47.354 --> 19:49.155
when I'm encrypting
my demented ramblings.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.157
That or Helvetica.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.761
Presumably you all came in here

19:54.861 --> 19:56.329
to tell me what you learned. Yes.

19:56.429 --> 19:59.065
This card was printed
on a consumer inkjet printer.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.066
Make and model?

20:00.166 --> 20:01.167
Still working on that.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.502
But get this:

20:02.602 --> 20:04.804
the ink he used
contained real silver.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.906
Which is not
a good idea.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.775
Those tiny flecks are pointy.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.579
So they leave tiny microscopic
punctures in the print head.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.381
<i>So when you look up close?</i>

20:14.481 --> 20:15.782
<i>It makes the same error</i>

20:15.882 --> 20:17.216
<i>over and over
and over and over again.</i>

20:17.317 --> 20:18.518
Exactly.
So, whoever's behind

20:18.618 --> 20:20.253
all these murders,

20:20.353 --> 20:22.322
everything they print will
have these distinctive errors.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.857
Because the printer has its
own distinct "fingerprint."

20:25.492 --> 20:26.826
Nice catch.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.361
It's a start. I'd like
to review more material

20:28.461 --> 20:31.364
he's printed, but the only
people who got some are

20:31.464 --> 20:34.200
either in a mental hospital,
in prison or dead.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.502
Except our dear friend Molly.

20:35.602 --> 20:38.237
Who I would really like
to talk to.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.539
You know, Molly is a tricky one.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.174
I asked LVPD to put a car
outside the house

20:42.275 --> 20:43.643
because I got
to talk to her again.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.944
Okay, well, I
could go with you.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.346
Mm, nah...

20:46.446 --> 20:48.014
I think the rest of your
afternoon just walked in.

20:48.114 --> 20:48.881
Hey.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.250
Folsom.
What you got?

20:51.351 --> 20:52.419
Dead coyote.

20:52.519 --> 20:53.920
Ooh-ooh.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.423
Really appreciate you coming
all this way, Mrs. Cantwell.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.725
You know, I'm sorry to have
to ask all these questions.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.026
It's perfectly all
right, Detective.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.961
Anything I can
do to help.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.896
Now, we've heard your
husband would go on

21:03.996 --> 21:06.466
extended research
trips for his books.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.469
Did he generally keep you in
the loop on his whereabouts?

21:09.569 --> 21:10.737
Well, it's somewhat embarrassing,

21:10.837 --> 21:11.738
but I don't remember
the last time

21:11.838 --> 21:12.872
Harrison and I spoke.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.106
He always had
his satellite phone

21:14.206 --> 21:15.708
in his bag,
but typically he kept it

21:15.808 --> 21:17.377
powered off
to conserve the battery.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.711
There's something
that I'd like to ask

21:18.811 --> 21:20.212
of you, if that's possible.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.881
Fire away.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.651
Has the medical examiner given
an official cause of death?

21:24.751 --> 21:26.653
Now, I only ask because
I'd like to have

21:26.753 --> 21:28.488
the death certificate expedited.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.222
For legal reasons.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.791
"Legal reasons"?

21:31.891 --> 21:33.192
Can you tell
me a little bit

21:33.292 --> 21:34.761
more about what you mean?

21:34.861 --> 21:36.596
Well, I've always had
to manage Harrison's business

21:36.696 --> 21:38.898
and I've always had
to move money around.

21:38.998 --> 21:41.100
Those month-long walkabouts
are pretty expensive.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.169
Every dollar that came in,
it went right back out.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.905
We were always
funding the next one. So...

21:46.005 --> 21:47.440
from a financial point of view,

21:47.540 --> 21:49.476
his death might've actually
saved you some money.

21:49.576 --> 21:52.078
That's one way to look at it.

21:52.178 --> 21:53.713
Hmm.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.351
Beau?

21:58.451 --> 22:00.186
Beau.

22:01.654 --> 22:02.789
You all right?

22:02.889 --> 22:05.425
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.
Really?

22:05.525 --> 22:07.660
Don't know.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.762
You seem less yourself lately.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.365
Did I miss a memo or something?

22:12.465 --> 22:14.066
Folsom was all over me, too.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.202
Sorry.

22:16.302 --> 22:18.871
We all see it.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.408
You know,
when you first came to CSI,

22:21.508 --> 22:23.275
you had a new lease
of life.

22:23.376 --> 22:26.145
But ever since
you've retreated to the lab...

22:26.245 --> 22:28.180
I know it sounds simple.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.282
"Just get back
out there." But...

22:30.383 --> 22:33.686
The world outside of
these four walls is terrifying.

22:33.786 --> 22:34.754
I mean...

22:34.854 --> 22:37.457
under this powerful mustache,

22:37.557 --> 22:39.058
is a sensitive soul, Allie.

22:39.158 --> 22:42.294
Okay.

22:42.395 --> 22:45.097
Look, when you're ready,

22:45.197 --> 22:46.433
I'm here for you.

22:48.267 --> 22:49.569
Okay.

22:49.669 --> 22:53.305
Silicon dioxide, alkali
feldspar, plagioclase.

22:53.406 --> 22:56.876
I mean, if you put
them all together:

22:56.976 --> 23:00.346
that's got to be
granite in Mr...

23:00.447 --> 23:01.681
Mr. Cantwell's ear.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.282
Granite.
You just know that?

23:03.382 --> 23:06.686
Oh, I had the world's
greatest geology professor.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.120
Dr. William.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.156
And if I remember
his class correctly,

23:10.256 --> 23:13.392
there shouldn't be a ton of
granite in this river valley.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.862
It might tell us something
about where he was digging

23:15.962 --> 23:17.163
when he got attacked.

23:17.263 --> 23:19.766
I need to get
some geological maps.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.134
Oh, and Allie?
Mm-hmm?

23:23.570 --> 23:24.871
Thank you.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.847
Okay, so...

23:34.947 --> 23:37.049
these are the places
our coyote walked

23:37.149 --> 23:38.518
in the weeks and months
before she was shot.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.152
Well, I
found granite

23:40.252 --> 23:42.154
in the victim's ear, but granite
isn't found in the river itself,

23:42.254 --> 23:44.691
just the tributaries--
these five are the closest.

23:44.791 --> 23:46.693
That cactus needle
you found on the shoe

23:46.793 --> 23:49.261
is from a cactus called
<i>opuntia basilaris.</i>

23:49.361 --> 23:52.632
Typically found at
elevations above 800 feet.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.066
Okay,
well, let's see.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.968
Our coyote only visited
one of those tributaries

23:56.068 --> 23:59.438
in her final days, which should
put our mystery site...

23:59.539 --> 24:02.008
Around here. Near that
little branch in the river.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.410
"X" marks the spot.

24:04.511 --> 24:05.778
Hey, Al.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.180
You're never gonna
believe this.

24:14.386 --> 24:16.489
It's Harrison's dig site.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.032
This is major.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.002
The skull alone was
a big find, right?

24:30.102 --> 24:32.672
I don't think anyone has
ever found a Clovis skeleton

24:32.772 --> 24:34.273
this complete before.

24:34.373 --> 24:36.342
This could end up
in textbooks.

24:36.442 --> 24:38.177
I doubt the textbooks
will include this.

24:38.277 --> 24:41.413
This site wasn't just why
he was killed, it was where.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.450
There was a fight
to the death, right here.

24:47.186 --> 24:50.757
We finally got
our crime scene.

25:04.871 --> 25:05.672
Serena.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.540
What's going
on with you?

25:07.640 --> 25:10.342
Is there something about all
this that's bothering you?

25:10.442 --> 25:12.344
I told you I'm fine.

25:12.444 --> 25:13.713
Okay.

25:15.447 --> 25:16.783
Listen, if you need to talk...

25:16.883 --> 25:18.284
Josh, drop it, okay?

25:18.384 --> 25:19.552
This dig, just underway.

25:19.652 --> 25:22.421
But already
it's incredibly exciting.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.357
Harrison Cantwell's
got to be excited, too.

25:25.457 --> 25:27.093
Until it
got him killed.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.962
It happened right about here,
if I had to guess.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.565
It's the highest concentration
of blood left out here.

25:32.665 --> 25:33.966
That's pretty funky, right?

25:34.066 --> 25:35.334
It looks like
blood's been cleaned off

25:35.434 --> 25:36.769
<i>with hydrogen peroxide.</i>

25:36.869 --> 25:38.404
<i>Ooh-whee.</i>

25:38.504 --> 25:40.172
That means somebody
was clever.

25:40.272 --> 25:43.776
DNA shrivels and dies at
the feet of hydrogen peroxide.

25:43.876 --> 25:47.814
Pulling alleles out of that
is gonna be a struggle.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.415
Hey, guys?

25:50.950 --> 25:53.820
Nice find, Serena.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.822
Couple calls to his wife Rose.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.757
The last call
was made...

25:57.857 --> 26:00.226
47 days ago.
Two minutes and change,

26:00.326 --> 26:03.462
to Dr. Qadiri's office,
Natural History Museum.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.964
If he told her
about this find,

26:05.064 --> 26:07.299
control over the site
is certainly something

26:07.399 --> 26:08.835
two archaeologists
might fight over.

26:12.972 --> 26:16.208
I think it's time Dr. Qadiri
gets a second visit, huh?

26:16.308 --> 26:17.610
You want to join us?

26:17.710 --> 26:18.911
You know,
I'd love to,

26:19.011 --> 26:21.247
but I've been invited to
meet a bunch of fish

26:21.347 --> 26:23.515
at Molly Tate's house.

26:23.616 --> 26:28.154
Lori, Nora, Luke,
Violet, Chloe.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.389
Melissa, Bill,

26:30.489 --> 26:32.591
Greg and Stacy. Yeah.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.560
You decorate these yourself?

26:34.661 --> 26:35.795
Yeah,
I like fish.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.563
There's no stress in them.

26:37.664 --> 26:38.564
And they can't hear

26:38.665 --> 26:40.132
what I'm thinking.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.102
I know.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.104
I know how
all of it sounds.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.706
Yeah.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.440
Feeling like people can
hear your thoughts

26:48.540 --> 26:50.309
does sound...

26:50.409 --> 26:52.945
a little stressful.

26:54.413 --> 26:55.614
And lonely.

26:55.715 --> 26:58.417
I tell myself
no one can read minds.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.219
A part of me thinks...

27:00.319 --> 27:03.555
"No, it's true, they can."

27:04.791 --> 27:05.992
Sitting here, I-I'm worried

27:06.092 --> 27:08.294
you're gonna hear
the wrong thing and...

27:08.394 --> 27:10.262
lock me up for good.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.631
But your fish don't do that.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.673
A couple
months back...

27:20.773 --> 27:23.209
I was attacked.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.412
And afterwards...

27:26.512 --> 27:28.480
I mean, I knew
the person was gone,

27:28.580 --> 27:30.382
but I still
got nervous.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.084
It's just... It is hard.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.753
It's hard when you can't
control your thoughts.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.287
You don't seem nervous now.

27:35.387 --> 27:39.091
The person that, uh, hurt me,
they're behind bars now.

27:42.628 --> 27:44.563
I killed my guy.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.166
So I'm safe now, too.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.601
Molly, you know you
don't believe that.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.170
And neither do I.

27:52.238 --> 27:53.472
Honey...

27:53.572 --> 27:54.841
You need to be put

27:54.941 --> 27:56.308
in protective custody.
I can't.

27:56.408 --> 27:59.145
I don't... I don't want to.
The man who came here

27:59.245 --> 28:00.446
to hurt you,

28:00.546 --> 28:02.648
he was sent here by someone.

28:02.749 --> 28:05.551
Someone who also
sent you a dossier.

28:05.651 --> 28:07.920
And a card with
silver ink, Molly.

28:08.020 --> 28:08.788
Silver ink.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.422
Silver ink. I don't know.

28:10.522 --> 28:11.891
I don't know, I'm scared!

28:11.991 --> 28:14.493
We all get scared sometimes.

28:14.593 --> 28:16.863
But the person who
send you that dossier

28:16.963 --> 28:19.165
and that card with
the silver ink,

28:19.265 --> 28:20.767
they left something on it.

28:22.001 --> 28:24.971
I can find it...

28:25.071 --> 28:26.806
if you let me.

28:29.608 --> 28:32.211
I've been so tired.

28:35.915 --> 28:38.717
Silver ink. Silver ink.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.193
I'm gonna trust you.

28:49.295 --> 28:50.830
Find him, please.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.131
Come here.

28:56.602 --> 28:58.437
Hey, Detective, you're back.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.539
We need to speak
to Dr. Qadiri.

29:00.639 --> 29:01.740
I-I think
she's in her office.

29:01.841 --> 29:04.043
There-there's nothing
wrong, is there?

29:04.143 --> 29:05.177
I don't know yet.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.645
Would you mind
taking us back?

29:06.745 --> 29:08.948
Of course.
Uh, right this way.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.287
That's strange. Uh...

29:15.387 --> 29:16.555
This-this door is

29:16.655 --> 29:18.057
never locked
during business hours.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.926
But, um, here.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.728
Used to be my office, I can...

29:22.829 --> 29:24.263
let you in
no problem.

29:24.363 --> 29:28.067
People are in and out
of here for supplies

29:28.167 --> 29:29.802
all the time.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.593
Hey, this has Rose Cantwell's
name on the return address.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.996
And it's postmarked
after Harrison died.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.966
Did Rose mention that she was
friendly with Dr. Qadiri?

30:00.066 --> 30:01.367
Uh-uh.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.634
Huh.

30:02.734 --> 30:03.903
It's open.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.905
By the looks of it...

30:06.005 --> 30:08.707
she sent
Qadiri some...

30:08.807 --> 30:10.342
of Harrison's notes.

30:10.442 --> 30:13.880
I'm also seeing what looks like
two sets of handwriting.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.381
You think Dr. Qadiri
and Rose were planning on

30:15.481 --> 30:17.249
getting rich
off his big find?

30:17.349 --> 30:20.086
I mean, it was brand-new dig
site, it was barely developed.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.888
I doubt the killer
counted on Cantwell

30:21.988 --> 30:25.157
making a run for it after
being mortally wounded.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.093
If they had hopes of
taking credit for the find,

30:27.193 --> 30:28.995
they might've been waiting
for him to pop up.

30:29.095 --> 30:30.662
What are the odds?
If there's one thing

30:30.762 --> 30:32.764
I've learned
since I moved to Vegas:

30:32.865 --> 30:35.101
don't put anything
past anybody.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.069
Especially when it
comes to getting rich.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.505
See what you can
get off of that.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.293
Hey, guys.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.629
So, Max took a crack at
finding DNA in that blood

31:03.729 --> 31:05.397
that we found
at the scene.

31:05.497 --> 31:06.565
No dice.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.000
Hydrogen peroxide
stays undefeated.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.301
We're having better luck here.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.037
Fingerprints from
both Rose Cantwell

31:11.137 --> 31:13.205
and Dr. Laura Qadiri on
Harrison Cantwell's notes.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.041
Both of them were
working together,

31:15.141 --> 31:17.309
and yet both of them
failed to mention that.

31:17.409 --> 31:20.046
Time for a little
dueling banjos.

31:20.146 --> 31:21.747
Maybe both of them ought
to come have a chat about it.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.215
I'd like to see them deny it.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.883
<i>No, you're right.</i>

31:24.984 --> 31:27.153
Dr. Qadiri and I were
working together.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.956
We started a few months
before Harrison was killed.

31:30.056 --> 31:32.724
Rose is a brilliant
prose stylist.

31:32.824 --> 31:35.494
She was pushing Harrison to
the next level of his career.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.863
<i>Laura brought extensive archaeological</i>

31:37.964 --> 31:41.633
expertise and credibility,
which Harrison

31:41.733 --> 31:43.335
was frankly lacking.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.237
<i>Harrison, Rose and I had a deal.</i>

31:45.337 --> 31:48.374
I'd help research the Cantwells'
book, write the foreword.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.742
In exchange, I could publish
anything Harrison found

31:50.842 --> 31:52.945
in the academic press,
as lead author.

31:53.045 --> 31:54.180
Well, why didn't you mention
this earlier?

31:54.280 --> 31:55.714
It's not like we're
hiding anything.

31:55.814 --> 31:57.749
All of this had
Harrison's blessing.

31:57.849 --> 31:59.485
It didn't seem
particularly relevant

31:59.585 --> 32:01.120
to your investigation.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.623
We found Harrison's
satellite phone.

32:04.723 --> 32:07.059
And the last call he made
might've been the day he died.

32:07.159 --> 32:10.629
Can you tell us where
you were on January 9th

32:10.729 --> 32:12.131
at 1:30
in the afternoon?

32:12.231 --> 32:13.532
<i>Where were you...</i>

32:13.632 --> 32:16.202
on January 9th at around
1:30 in the afternoon?

32:16.302 --> 32:17.669
<i>He had just made the find</i>

32:17.769 --> 32:19.338
of a lifetime.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.372
He called it in.

32:20.472 --> 32:21.974
And one of you
killed him for it.

32:22.074 --> 32:23.375
Wait,
wait, wait, stop.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.844
Just... Just hold on.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.614
January 9th? I was
traveling that weekend.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.349
A lot of people saw us.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.151
Saw who?

32:33.285 --> 32:35.087
You and Dr. Qadiri
were both in Illinois?

32:35.187 --> 32:37.256
In point of fact,

32:37.356 --> 32:38.524
we were together.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.792
I hate to say it, but
I-I think our theory

32:40.892 --> 32:42.061
is kind of
falling apart.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.662
Oh, no, it's really
falling apart.

32:43.762 --> 32:46.798
Laura and I were in Chicago
to speak with a publisher.

32:46.898 --> 32:48.100
The meeting
fell through,

32:48.200 --> 32:50.202
but we were there
until Wednesday.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.603
What...

32:51.703 --> 32:53.872
Was th...

32:53.972 --> 32:56.208
Do you think that's
when he was killed?

32:56.308 --> 32:59.911
Right after he
made the find?

33:01.047 --> 33:02.414
I didn't know.

33:02.514 --> 33:03.982
I know you found
their prints on the same

33:04.083 --> 33:06.285
manuscript pages. But...

33:06.385 --> 33:08.487
they're still
on the same page.
Mm-hmm.

33:08.587 --> 33:11.790
Same story.
Same alibi.
Mm-hmm.

33:11.890 --> 33:13.825
And you've got
the same problem.

33:13.925 --> 33:15.927
No hard evidence.

33:23.302 --> 33:25.471
Any of y'all want to call
it a night, feel free.

33:25.571 --> 33:26.905
Come on, boss.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.640
This is our chance to
drink mediocre coffee

33:28.740 --> 33:30.876
at 2:00 in the morning.
Yeah, <i>was</i> your chance.

33:30.976 --> 33:33.579
I can't stop thinking about
Cantwell's last phone call.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.381
I mean, two minutes
and eight seconds.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.015
Someone at the museum answered,

33:37.116 --> 33:38.817
talked to him and turned him
into a hotel for tarantulas.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.386
Well,
there had to be

33:40.486 --> 33:41.687
a lot of young and
hungry archaeologists

33:41.787 --> 33:43.155
at the museum who
would do anything

33:43.255 --> 33:45.091
to lay claim to the
discovery he made, right?

33:45.191 --> 33:47.159
Logan MacArthur said everyone
had access to the office

33:47.259 --> 33:48.460
where the call came in.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.096
It was never
locked, so

33:50.196 --> 33:52.198
tying to someone specific
is gonna be tricky.

33:52.298 --> 33:53.765
Actually...

33:53.865 --> 33:56.635
there might be someone
we can tie to the crime scene.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.870
Do we still have that
blood sample from the rib?

33:58.970 --> 34:00.572
The one that killer cleaned up?
Oh, yeah.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.007
We got lots of blood.

34:02.108 --> 34:03.375
No DNA to speak of, though.
If I'm right,

34:03.475 --> 34:05.043
we don't need DNA.

34:09.148 --> 34:10.682
Blood.
Thank you.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.987
Wright stain.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.770
Well, red blood cells
look normal.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.206
These are different kinds
of white blood cells:

34:34.306 --> 34:37.809
you've got neutrophils,
lymphocytes and monocytes...

34:37.909 --> 34:39.010
There are four different types,

34:39.111 --> 34:40.446
but we're only interested
in one:

34:40.546 --> 34:41.847
the basophils.

34:41.947 --> 34:43.081
And basophils
are the markers

34:43.182 --> 34:44.483
for this disease?

34:44.583 --> 34:46.552
Mm-hmm. And when there
are no basophils,

34:46.652 --> 34:48.053
there are a lack of histamines.

34:48.154 --> 34:49.488
I guess if all
this blood work

34:49.588 --> 34:50.889
helps put the killer
behind bars,

34:50.989 --> 34:52.424
at least they get
a free diagnosis out of it.

34:52.524 --> 34:53.425
I'm not seeing

34:53.525 --> 34:56.061
any, are you?
Nope.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.797
<i>The person who left their
blood at the crime scene,</i>

34:58.897 --> 35:02.568
<i>all their histamines were stuck
to the underside of their skin,</i>

35:02.668 --> 35:04.370
<i>which means...</i>

35:04.470 --> 35:07.739
Our man has cold urticaria.

35:07.839 --> 35:09.875
Our man? We got him?

35:09.975 --> 35:11.510
We got him.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.913
There you go,
Mr. MacArthur,

35:15.013 --> 35:16.448
nice and cold.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.587
I want to help you all
in any way that I can,

35:21.687 --> 35:22.954
but...

35:23.054 --> 35:24.423
...frankly, I-I'm not
sure why I'm here.

35:24.523 --> 35:25.924
On the day he died,

35:26.024 --> 35:28.160
your friend Harrison Cantwell
made a phone call.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.796
The last one he'd ever make.
To Dr. Qadiri's office.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.798
Your old office.
Now, you're

35:32.898 --> 35:35.234
in there all the time, right?

35:35.334 --> 35:37.002
You admitted it yourself.

35:37.102 --> 35:38.904
I'm not sure what
you're driving at, but...

35:39.004 --> 35:40.506
I didn't speak to Harrison.

35:40.606 --> 35:41.940
Yeah, you did.

35:42.508 --> 35:46.478
<i>Your pal Harrison,
he told you about his discovery.</i>

35:46.578 --> 35:48.780
<i>A career-making find.</i>

35:48.880 --> 35:52.884
<i>So you raced out there
and found out it was true.</i>

35:52.984 --> 35:55.587
<i>A man who was not a scientist</i>

35:55.687 --> 35:57.623
<i>had discovered something</i>

35:57.723 --> 35:59.157
<i>you never could.</i>

35:59.258 --> 36:01.360
<i>And he was on his way
into the history books.</i>

36:01.460 --> 36:04.162
<i>You argued. You fought.</i>

36:05.297 --> 36:07.366
<i>You got injured,</i>

36:07.466 --> 36:08.667
<i>your resentment boiled over,</i>

36:08.767 --> 36:10.736
<i>and you stabbed him.</i>

36:13.339 --> 36:16.242
<i>But you were too hurt to follow.</i>

36:17.543 --> 36:18.677
How am I doing so far?

36:18.777 --> 36:20.879
You want
to show us your scar

36:20.979 --> 36:22.748
where you got impaled
on that rib?

36:22.848 --> 36:24.182
I loved Harrison.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.984
Uh, I wouldn't hurt a bug,

36:26.084 --> 36:30.389
l-let alone a-a great thinker,

36:30.489 --> 36:32.291
a-a great friend.

36:33.259 --> 36:35.627
You don't have any proof
of any of this.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.796
Uh-oh.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.831
What's-what's that there?

36:39.931 --> 36:42.834
N-nothing. Just a nettle rash.

36:42.934 --> 36:45.237
I-I get it sometimes,
because of cold.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.805
I know.

36:46.905 --> 36:50.309
Your "nettle rash" is actually
a minor immune disease

36:50.409 --> 36:52.478
called cold urticaria.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.546
If you say so.
Oh, we do say so.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.649
That's actually how we know
you returned to the scene.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.885
And cleaned the bones
with hydrogen peroxide.

36:59.985 --> 37:02.288
I mean, that was very smart.

37:02.388 --> 37:03.455
It was.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.624
Because it took care
of all the DNA.

37:05.724 --> 37:09.761
But it did not destroy
the blood cells,

37:09.861 --> 37:11.663
or the telltale signs

37:11.763 --> 37:14.533
of the disease
they're fighting.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.269
Sir, the killer had
cold urticaria.

37:17.369 --> 37:21.072
<i>The same thing Ms. Rajan noticed
that you had back at the museum.</i>

37:26.812 --> 37:28.414
I-I-I...

37:28.514 --> 37:30.181
I didn't want any of this.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.085
I-I was just upset.

37:34.185 --> 37:36.422
He-he was going
to take credit.

37:36.522 --> 37:38.290
It was all an accident.

37:38.390 --> 37:41.226
I'm sorry, this is
about credit?
You wouldn't understand.

37:41.327 --> 37:42.661
50 years I-I've worked.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.162
I-I've never had a find

37:44.262 --> 37:45.364
like that.

37:45.464 --> 37:46.865
Harrison
w-would've never

37:46.965 --> 37:50.101
found that site
if it were not for my help,

37:50.201 --> 37:52.871
<i>my</i> museum's
resources.

37:52.971 --> 37:54.906
He had his whole life
ahead of him.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.476
He could've shared this.
He-he could've made

37:57.576 --> 37:58.644
a hundred new discoveries.

37:58.744 --> 37:59.978
No, he's not going to.

38:00.579 --> 38:01.813
Not now.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.816
Hands behind your back.

38:06.352 --> 38:07.986
Stand up for me.

38:17.896 --> 38:20.366
Poor gal got a spear
stuck in her craw.

38:20.466 --> 38:21.967
Yeah.

38:22.067 --> 38:24.069
What's stuck in yours?

38:26.872 --> 38:28.407
It's nothing.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.343
You know what?

38:33.311 --> 38:34.946
A few weeks ago,

38:35.046 --> 38:37.916
you asked me
what was wrong.

38:38.684 --> 38:41.152
And I told you.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.523
Back in Miami,
when I first made detective,

38:44.623 --> 38:46.758
I got a case.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.162
16-year-old runaway,

38:51.262 --> 38:54.199
disappeared from
a motel room in Opa-Locka.

38:55.601 --> 38:57.102
A little keychain
like this was

38:57.202 --> 38:58.770
the only thing left behind.

38:58.870 --> 38:59.771
Until about a month later

38:59.871 --> 39:02.107
we found her skull.

39:03.274 --> 39:05.276
Just her skull.

39:07.879 --> 39:10.015
I was green,
so I thought if I just

39:10.115 --> 39:12.451
worked the case
hard enough...

39:16.722 --> 39:20.158
But that's not always
how it works.
Mm-mm.

39:23.462 --> 39:24.796
It's a hard lesson.

39:24.896 --> 39:28.700
I mean, we can't always
find the bad guys.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.636
But her family...

39:30.736 --> 39:33.371
Her family saw
you try, right?

39:33.472 --> 39:35.173
That matters.

39:35.273 --> 39:37.342
Only so much.

39:37.443 --> 39:39.711
Only so much.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.716
Hey.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.052
You ready
to hit the road?

39:47.152 --> 39:48.820
Yeah.

39:51.890 --> 39:54.359
Have a good night.

40:45.511 --> 40:47.445
You go through Molly's dossier?
Yep, fully processed.

40:47.546 --> 40:51.683
453 pages of
blackmail material.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.118
It was really interesting.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.786
Not the what,
but the how.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.488
When I found
Lamont Moore's dossier,

40:56.588 --> 40:58.924
it showed that he was being
coerced by photos,

40:59.024 --> 41:00.626
electronic surveillance.

41:00.726 --> 41:01.827
Molly's was different.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.428
A few years ago,
she confessed to

41:03.529 --> 41:05.030
a few non-violent crimes.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.699
But not to her diary,
not to police.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.035
To her therapist.

41:11.102 --> 41:13.338
Why do I feel like I know
exactly where this is headed?

41:13.438 --> 41:14.673
Okay,

41:14.773 --> 41:15.907
look at the handwriting.
Mm-hmm.

41:16.007 --> 41:16.942
Molly's
blackmail material.

41:17.042 --> 41:18.276
And then Dr.
Auerbach's notes

41:18.376 --> 41:19.978
from Lynn Zobrist's
therapy sessions.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.913
We got get this
by a jury, all right?

41:22.013 --> 41:23.882
Handwriting analysis
is way too shaky

41:23.982 --> 41:25.216
to hold up
in court.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.852
We won't need to build
our case around that.

41:26.952 --> 41:28.053
Tell me. Okay.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.254
Dr. Auerbach's notes, which

41:29.354 --> 41:30.922
by law, only
she can have,

41:31.022 --> 41:32.157
were printed

41:32.257 --> 41:33.925
<i>on the same printer...</i>

41:36.061 --> 41:38.897
that produced
these cards.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.632
They all have
the same flaw.

41:40.732 --> 41:44.903
<i>Our mastermind's digital
fingerprint is on all of them.</i>

41:45.003 --> 41:47.138
The sick mind

41:47.238 --> 41:48.540
behind all of these murders...

41:59.084 --> 42:01.853
<i>...is Dr. Diane Auerbach.</i>

42:01.953 --> 42:04.189
Has to be.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.893
Has to be.
