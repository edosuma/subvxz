<i>&lrm;magic jewels with extraordinary</i>

02:08.600 --> 02:11.400
&lrm;Master, the Moth Miraculous,
&lrm;I felt its aura.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.520
&lrm;I thought it was lost forever.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.720
&lrm;But master, it's a negative aura.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.000
&lrm;I fear it's in the hands of a dark power.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.720
&lrm;We must find Nooroo and his Miraculous.

02:20.880 --> 02:24.040
&lrm;If it's in the wrong hands,
&lrm;there's no telling what evil

&lrm;I can no longer do it alone.

10:26.680 --> 10:27.760
&lrm;Swanky.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.600
&lrm;[chomping] Don't touch that!

10:29.760 --> 10:31.040
&lrm;Come back here.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.240
&lrm;It's so shiny. Can you eat this?

10:33.400 --> 10:35.800
&lrm;[chomping] No, you can't. What about this?

10:36.640 --> 10:39.520
&lrm;Marinette, I know everything
&lrm;seems a bit strange...

10:41.320 --> 10:42.960
&lrm;OK, if you feel safer.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.160
&lrm;What are you?
&lrm;How do you know my name?

10:45.480 --> 10:49.040
&lrm;I'm a Kwami, and my name is Tikki.
&lrm;Now, just let me explain.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.160
&lrm;[chomping]

10:51.920 --> 10:53.080
&lrm;[yelping]

10:53.240 --> 10:55.120
&lrm;I still don't know why you're here.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.040
&lrm;I'm a Kwami. I grant powers.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.320
&lrm;Yours is the power of destruction. Got it?

11:00.240 --> 11:02.520
&lrm;Good. Got anything to eat? I'm starving.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.440
&lrm;My dad's pranking me, right?

11:04.600 --> 11:06.520
&lrm;Wait, he has no sense of humour.

11:06.680 --> 11:09.760
&lrm;He must never know I exist
&lrm;or anyone for that matter.

11:10.880 --> 11:11.920
&lrm;Mom! Dad!

11:12.080 --> 11:14.120
&lrm;No, no, no.

11:14.280 --> 11:16.960
&lrm;I'm your friend, Marinette.
&lrm;You must trust me.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.760
&lrm;You're the only one
&lrm;who can stop Stoneheart.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.760
&lrm;Do you think they'll be up to it, master?

11:21.920 --> 11:23.040
&lrm;I only got it wrong once.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.760
&lrm;It will not happen again.
&lrm;At least I hope not.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.240
&lrm;This has to be a mistake.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.520
&lrm;The only superpower
&lrm;I could have is super-awkwardness.

11:35.680 --> 11:37.520
&lrm;I know. Alya would know.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.720
&lrm;I think she would. She loves superheroes.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.000
&lrm;She'd totally be up for it. Ask her.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.080
&lrm;Marinette, you're the chosen one.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.560
&lrm;I'm stuck here. I can't even go to school.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.680
&lrm;What good's a superhero
&lrm;imprisoned in his own house?

11:50.840 --> 11:53.440
&lrm;No good.
&lrm;That's why it's all going to change,

11:53.600 --> 11:54.920
&lrm;if you're willing to change.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.480
&lrm;OK, so all I do

11:57.600 --> 11:59.120
&lrm;is break the object
&lrm;where that thingy is?

11:59.680 --> 12:02.880
&lrm;It's called an Akuma,
&lrm;which you must capture.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.240
&lrm;Got it. Capture it.
&lrm;What's that charm thing?

12:05.400 --> 12:08.120
&lrm;Your lucky charm, it's your super-power.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.680
&lrm;This is all going too fast.

12:10.840 --> 12:13.560
&lrm;I won't be able to pull this off.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.320
&lrm;Trust yourself, Marinette.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.840
&lrm;Just say "Spots on".

12:17.200 --> 12:18.240
&lrm;Spots on?

12:21.360 --> 12:22.720
&lrm;What's happening?

12:27.120 --> 12:28.680
&lrm;"Claws out", that's how you transform.

12:28.840 --> 12:29.800
&lrm;Got it.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.120
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

12:32.280 --> 12:33.440
&lrm;Wait, I haven't finished...

12:48.280 --> 12:49.280
&lrm;Too cool.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.400
&lrm;How does this thing come off?

12:53.560 --> 12:56.600
&lrm;Tikki? If you can hear me,
&lrm;I want my normal clothes back.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.360
&lrm;I'm not going anywhere.

12:58.520 --> 13:02.040
<i>&lrm;Stoneheart is heading to</i>
<i>&lrm;the Montparnasse tower.</i>

13:02.200 --> 13:03.200
&lrm;Alya?

13:03.360 --> 13:05.760
&lrm;[Sabine] Marinette, did you get home OK?

13:05.920 --> 13:08.040
&lrm;Yeah, mom, just super.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.440
&lrm;Marinette? You in here?

13:09.800 --> 13:11.400
&lrm;[Sabine] Tom, we'd better call the school.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.520
&lrm;OK, I have special powers.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.000
&lrm;And apparently this amazing
&lrm;super yoyo thingy.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.480
&lrm;[she yells]

13:23.360 --> 13:25.200
&lrm;I'm getting the hang of this.

13:25.360 --> 13:26.800
&lrm;[whistling]
&lrm;[yelling]

13:29.440 --> 13:31.520
&lrm;[they groan]

13:31.680 --> 13:34.880
&lrm;-Hey, nice of you to drop in.
&lrm;-Sorry, I didn't do it on purpose.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.320
&lrm;I bet you're the partner
&lrm;my Kwami told me about.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.080
&lrm;I'm... Cat Noir.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.960
&lrm;Yeah, Cat Noir... And you?

13:42.680 --> 13:44.360
&lrm;I'm...

13:46.040 --> 13:48.080
&lrm;Madly clumsy, I'm so clumsy.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.200
&lrm;No sweat, Clumsy-girl. I'm learning too.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.880
&lrm;[crashing]

13:56.760 --> 13:59.920
&lrm;-Wait, where are you going?
&lrm;-To save Paris, right?

14:00.080 --> 14:02.960
&lrm;[she sighs]
&lrm;Trust yourself, trust yourself.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.280
&lrm;[whizzing]

14:04.440 --> 14:05.480
&lrm;[she yells]

14:09.520 --> 14:11.200
&lrm;[thudding] Kim!

14:11.360 --> 14:13.360
&lrm;So, who's the wuss now?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.440
&lrm;[Rose screams]

14:22.080 --> 14:25.080
&lrm;It's not nice to pick on
&lrm;people smaller than you.

14:25.280 --> 14:27.280
&lrm;I guess you're talking about yourself.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.040
&lrm;Everything's going to plan.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.480
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous
&lrm;have been activated.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.600
&lrm;Here they come to save the day

14:36.760 --> 14:38.960
&lrm;and now my supervillain will destroy them.

14:46.120 --> 14:47.440
&lrm;Where are you, partner?

14:50.440 --> 14:53.400
&lrm;I can't.
&lrm;I'm not going to be able to do it.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.280
&lrm;[Alya gasps]

15:04.120 --> 15:05.600
&lrm;What are you waiting for?

15:05.760 --> 15:06.840
&lrm;The world is watching!

15:18.200 --> 15:19.880
&lrm;Animal cruelty? How shameful.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.600
&lrm;Yes!

15:23.560 --> 15:24.840
&lrm;Sorry I took so long.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.760
&lrm;It's cool, Wonderbug.
&lrm;Let's kick his rocky behind.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.360
&lrm;Wait. He gets bigger with every attack.

15:30.520 --> 15:33.240
&lrm;-We have to do something different.
&lrm;-What?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.840
&lrm;I don't know.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.400
&lrm;Let's use our powers.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.720
&lrm;Cataclysm!

15:43.560 --> 15:45.640
&lrm;Apparently, I destroy whatever I touch.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.000
&lrm;I don't need a superpower for that.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.720
&lrm;[Ladybug] No, don't!

15:51.160 --> 15:53.080
&lrm;Cool, it's just you and me.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.760
&lrm;Time to rumble, soon-to-be rubble.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.120
&lrm;Wait!

16:00.640 --> 16:03.160
&lrm;I guess I only get one shot
&lrm;to use my power.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.440
&lrm;And you only have 5 minutes
&lrm;before you change back.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.320
&lrm;Didn't your Kwami explain?

16:09.480 --> 16:11.480
&lrm;I guess I was too excited.

16:11.640 --> 16:12.520
&lrm;Well, up to me?

16:13.560 --> 16:14.840
&lrm;Lucky charm!

16:20.120 --> 16:22.000
&lrm;[Cat Noir sarcastically] Super power.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.480
&lrm;My Kwami said I must break the object

16:24.640 --> 16:26.560
&lrm;where the Akuma is hiding.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.320
&lrm;He's made out of stone.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.320
&lrm;His hand, it's closed.

16:30.480 --> 16:31.800
&lrm;He never opens it.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.440
&lrm;It's like Russian dolls,

16:33.600 --> 16:35.800
&lrm;the object is hidden in his fist.

16:35.960 --> 16:36.880
&lrm;What's your plan?

16:43.560 --> 16:44.400
&lrm;This.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.080
&lrm;[Ladybug] Don't resist, trust me.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.360
&lrm;[yelling] This girl's crazy!

16:51.520 --> 16:53.080
&lrm;[Ladybug] Catch me if you can.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.480
&lrm;And now...

17:00.640 --> 17:02.040
&lrm;Alya, the tap!

17:18.160 --> 17:20.960
&lrm;This girl is awesome.
&lrm;She's crazy awesome.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.760
&lrm;What's going on? What am I doing here?

17:26.920 --> 17:29.120
&lrm;You were incredible, Miss...Bug Lady.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.120
&lrm;You did it.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.480
&lrm;We both did it.

17:31.640 --> 17:32.720
&lrm;Pound it!

17:32.880 --> 17:33.920
&lrm;[Bleeping]

17:34.080 --> 17:36.560
&lrm;You should go.
&lrm;Our identities must remain secret.

17:36.920 --> 17:40.240
&lrm;Farewell, milady,
&lrm;let's do this again soon.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.840
&lrm;Not too soon I hope.

17:47.960 --> 17:51.480
&lrm;"You haven't got the guts
&lrm;to tell Mylene you love her. Wuss!"

17:52.960 --> 17:55.240
&lrm;Kim wrote it. He makes fun of me.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.880
&lrm;You shouldn't get so upset about this.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.120
&lrm;There's no shame
&lrm;in telling someone you love them.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.240
&lrm;How do you know my name, Miss?

18:03.720 --> 18:06.040
&lrm;Uncanny, amazing, spectacular.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.280
&lrm;Will you be protecting Paris?
&lrm;How did you get your powers?

18:09.440 --> 18:11.440
<i>&lrm;Did you get stung</i>
<i>&lrm;by a radioactive ladybug?</i>

18:11.600 --> 18:13.960
<i>&lrm;I've got a ton of questions, Miss...?</i>

18:15.120 --> 18:17.960
<i>&lrm;Ladybug, call me Ladybug.</i>

18:18.120 --> 18:19.040
<i>&lrm;Ladybug...</i>

18:19.200 --> 18:20.440
&lrm;Super awesome.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.880
<i>&lrm;Thanks to this amateur footage,</i>

18:24.040 --> 18:26.200
<i>&lrm;Parisians now know who their heroes are.</i>

18:26.800 --> 18:28.000
&lrm;I did it, Tikki.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.600
&lrm;You see, you were up to it.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.320
&lrm;[Sabine] Marinette, dinner!

18:32.000 --> 18:36.640
<i>&lrm;We will be organising</i>
<i>&lrm;a huge celebration in honour of</i>

18:36.800 --> 18:39.880
<i>&lrm;our city's new protectors,</i>
<i>&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir.</i>

18:40.520 --> 18:42.960
&lrm;Ladybug, her name is Ladybug.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.960
&lrm;[revolted] What is this?

18:45.120 --> 18:47.240
&lrm;Seriously? My personal chef made it.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.000
&lrm;If you expect me to get my energy back,

18:50.160 --> 18:52.560
&lrm;I need to eat something more... delicate.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.120
&lrm;OK, what?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.040
&lrm;[Sabine] Oh my!

19:04.200 --> 19:07.120
<i>&lrm;Just as Paris is about to</i>
<i>&lrm;celebrate our new superheroes,</i>

19:07.280 --> 19:08.800
<i>&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir,</i>

19:08.960 --> 19:11.280
<i>&lrm;a new wave of panic has hit the capital</i>

19:11.440 --> 19:13.920
<i>&lrm;as people are turned into stone monsters.</i>

19:14.080 --> 19:15.520
<i>&lrm;It's simply unbelievable.</i>

19:16.160 --> 19:19.920
&lrm;Camembert cheese, fantastic.
&lrm;All he eats is camembert.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.440
&lrm;which means I'll smell like stinky cheese.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.480
<i>&lrm;The Stonebeings are still like statues.</i>

19:25.640 --> 19:27.920
<i>&lrm;Police are perplexed. What will happen?</i>

19:28.080 --> 19:29.640
<i>&lrm;Will they come to life?</i>

19:30.200 --> 19:32.560
&lrm;Plagg, what's going on? We defeated him.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.160
&lrm;Did you capture the akuma?

19:34.320 --> 19:37.200
&lrm;What's that got to do
&lrm;with the other Stonebeings?

19:37.360 --> 19:40.520
<i>&lrm;An Akuma can multiply</i>
<i>&lrm;that's why it must be captured.</i>

19:40.680 --> 19:42.680
<i>&lrm;If Ivan becomes negative again,</i>

19:42.840 --> 19:45.000
<i>&lrm;the Akuma will turn him back</i>
<i>&lrm;into Stoneheart.</i>

19:45.160 --> 19:47.720
&lrm;He'll use the Stonebeings as his army.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.400
&lrm;So that means this is all my fault?

19:50.560 --> 19:53.520
&lrm;I knew it.
&lrm;I'm not cut out to be a superhero.

19:53.680 --> 19:54.960
&lrm;I'll keep messing up.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.240
&lrm;Keep calm. It was your first time.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.720
&lrm;You'll capture Stoneheart's Akuma

19:59.880 --> 20:01.120
&lrm;and do it successfully.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.440
&lrm;I can't. I told you, I'm clumsy.
&lrm;I create disaster all the time.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.520
&lrm;I'll make things worse for everyone.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.320
&lrm;Cat Noir's better off alone, I'm quitting.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.400
&lrm;I can't do anything without Ladybug?

20:13.560 --> 20:15.320
&lrm;Only Ladybug can capture Akumas

20:15.480 --> 20:17.480
&lrm;and repair damage
&lrm;caused by a supervillain.

20:17.640 --> 20:21.840
&lrm;If Cat Noir can't capture
&lrm;the Akumas, find another Ladybug.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.760
&lrm;I'm not cut out to be Ladybug.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.280
&lrm;I'm sorry, Tikki.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.200
&lrm;No, don't...

20:28.800 --> 20:30.240
&lrm;Tikki?

20:39.520 --> 20:41.560
&lrm;I'm really sorry, Tikki.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.680
&lrm;Ivan has a sensitive heart.

20:45.840 --> 20:46.840
&lrm;It won't be long

20:47.000 --> 20:49.520
&lrm;before anger and sadness strike again.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.520
&lrm;and the Stonebeings will come alive.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.360
&lrm;Then we'll see how long
&lrm;you remain hidden, Ladybug.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.640
&lrm;Once I have your Miraculous,
&lrm;you will be powerless against me.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.040
<i>&lrm;Everyone will be powerless</i>
