00:13.000 --> 00:14.200
Going off-world?

00:14.400 --> 00:16.800
M7G-677.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.200
That's the planet with all the kids, right?

00:20.000 --> 00:26.000
They're having trouble with their E.M. Field generator,
and McKay has decided that I am the most
capable person in all of Atlantis to fix it.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.600
Well, don't worry. They're a great group of kids.
You're going to love them.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.000
My sister has a child.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.400
He breaks things.

00:31.440 --> 00:34.200
He throws things.
He smears things onto furniture.

00:34.240 --> 00:37.000
<i>Colonel Sheppard!
Need you up at the control room.</i>

00:37.800 --> 00:39.200
You still here?

00:39.240 --> 00:40.400
We're just leaving.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.400
Well, do say "hi" to the kids for me.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.000
<i>Idiot.</i>

00:48.040 --> 00:51.600
<i>"Say 'hi' to the kids for me."
You'll catch it from me. You are such an idiot.</i>

00:52.400 --> 00:54.000
<i>Two Wraith cruisers.</i>

00:54.040 --> 00:55.360
How far away are they?

00:55.400 --> 00:56.560
A day, maybe day and a half.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.000
I've been tracking them for some time now,

00:58.040 --> 01:00.400
but good news is, it doesn't
look like they're heading this way.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.400
- Just passing through the neighborhood?
- Yeah, it looks that way,

01:02.440 --> 01:04.400
but I just discovered something rather curious...

01:05.600 --> 01:08.800
short but intense energy bursts passing between them.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.600
They're fighting each other?

01:11.200 --> 01:12.200
In my...

01:12.240 --> 01:13.760
expert opinion, yes.

01:13.800 --> 01:14.760
That's good news.

01:14.800 --> 01:15.960
It certainly is.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.800
If there's any change in course at all, let me know.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.960
I just cut short a call with the secretary of state.
I hope this is worth it.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.800
I'm sorry, Sir, but a situation is developing that
you need to be made aware of. It couldn't wait.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.400
Alright, then, make me aware of it.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.200
We've noticed an increase in chatter
amongst the Trust recently.

01:34.240 --> 01:37.000
The Goa'uld have infiltrated
the highest ranks of the organization.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.600
We've discovered that
their access to government agencies

01:39.640 --> 01:41.800
has gone a lot deeper than we realized.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.560
How much deeper?

01:44.600 --> 01:45.800
Atlantis.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.400
They know about it?

01:47.800 --> 01:48.800
Worse.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.000
They've been there.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.600
They planted a bomb somewhere in the City.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.800
But I don't understand. Why...

02:58.840 --> 03:00.320
Why would the Goa'uld want to blow up Atlantis?

03:00.360 --> 03:03.200
I mean, I'd think they'd be eager to get
their hands on all that ancient technology.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.840
<i>They want the technology, sure,</i>

03:04.880 --> 03:08.600
but they're more concerned about the Wraith
finding their way to this galaxy.

03:08.640 --> 03:12.200
Last thing they need right now
is another enemy to contend with,

03:12.240 --> 03:14.200
especially one so formidable.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.400
Jeez, those poor people.

03:16.440 --> 03:20.800
I mean, as if they don't have enough to contend with
the Wraith. Now they have a Goa'uld in their midst?

03:20.840 --> 03:24.600
The intel we have suggests a lower-level
operative planted the bomb,

03:24.640 --> 03:27.000
which means we're dealing with a human.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.400
And from what little
we've been able to decipher so far,

03:29.440 --> 03:32.600
the bomb is set to be detonated
the next time Atlantis dials Earth.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.280
So the Trust have probably set up
a transmitter close to cheyenne mountain

03:36.320 --> 03:39.000
to be detonated at the exact moment
that the wormhole is established.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.800
- Which is today.
- What?

03:40.840 --> 03:44.200
- Oh, the weekly status report.
- In 2 hours and 46 minutes.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.600
Well, we have to warn them.
We have to tell them not to dial Earth.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.360
How?

03:47.400 --> 03:49.800
Even if we had the kind
of power needed to dial Atlantis,

03:49.840 --> 03:52.600
we couldn't, because that would detonate the bomb.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.960
What about the Daedalus?

03:54.000 --> 03:57.800
It's on a return voyage to the milky way.
We could use them to relay the trans...

03:57.840 --> 04:00.000
Oh, no... I mean, wait.

04:00.040 --> 04:04.000
God, there's no way they're close enough,
even with our long-range transmitters.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.400
You'll find another way to get the message to them.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.000
I will?

04:07.040 --> 04:08.160
Of course you will.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.200
That's what I pay you for.

04:13.800 --> 04:18.360
<i>Elizabeth's including intel about the infighting
amongst the Wraith in today's status report.</i>

04:18.399 --> 04:19.600
<i>Let's hope that trend continues.</i>

04:19.640 --> 04:21.000
<i>The Wraith keep fighting like this,</i>

04:21.040 --> 04:22.800
<i>we might be able to take the weekend off.</i>

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Cadman?

04:27.200 --> 04:28.560
What are you doing here?

04:28.600 --> 04:30.800
Well, it's good to see you, too, Rodney.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.800
No, I thought you were leaving on the Daedalus.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah, I was, but something came up.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.960
I asked colonel Sheppard if I could stay
around a little while longer.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.080
Oh, well... that's fine.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.200
You okay with that?

04:42.240 --> 04:43.600
Yeah of course it is,
why wouldn't it be?

04:44.200 --> 04:45.000
Colonel.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.000
Lieutenant.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.800
I would think, after all this time,
you'd stop being creeped out by her.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.800
Well, she just has a way of getting under my skin.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.600
Literally.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.560
Dr. Beckett?

05:06.600 --> 05:07.200
Yes?

05:07.800 --> 05:10.200
Do you have time to accompany me to the mainland?

05:11.400 --> 05:12.200
Is something wrong?

05:12.240 --> 05:15.000
A woman who is very close to me, Charin.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.600
Oh, yes, I remember her. Sweet lady.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.600
<i>She is like a grandmother to me.</i>

05:20.200 --> 05:22.520
I've just received word that she is very ill.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.200
I was wondering if you could look at her.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.000
Of course, love. Say no more.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.800
<i>Okay, this is Atlantis, deep in the Pegasus galaxy,</i>

05:32.840 --> 05:39.400
and this is the Daedalus that left there
about a week ago, on its way to...

05:39.800 --> 05:41.200
Earth.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.200
Now,

05:43.240 --> 05:46.200
since we can't dial the Gate to Atlantis,

05:46.240 --> 05:48.200
<i>we have no way to get a warning to them</i>

05:48.240 --> 05:51.400
except by use of a subspace data burst transmission

05:51.440 --> 05:53.920
relayed from our galaxy to Pegasus,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.200
using the Daedalus as one of the relay points.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.840
I thought you said the Daedalus was
too far away for our transmitter to reach.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.400
It is, which is why we have to get closer.

06:02.440 --> 06:09.400
P4M-399. It's a tiny little planet right on
the very outskirts of our galaxy,

06:09.440 --> 06:12.360
but if we can send a science
team there through the Gate,

06:12.400 --> 06:13.950
they should be close enough

06:13.955 --> 06:17.235
 to relay the information to the Daedalus
and then they can...

06:17.240 --> 06:19.200
it's like the twilight bark.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.400
The twilight bark?

06:22.440 --> 06:25.400
101 dalmatians.
Didn't you guys see that movie? My kids love it.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.000
Well, okay, so there's all these dogs,

06:27.040 --> 06:32.600
and one barks here, one barks here, one...
they send the message across the countryside...

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Lord of the rings.

06:35.040 --> 06:39.000
<i>Lord of the rings... you know, when they light
all those signal fires on the mountain tops?</i>

06:39.040 --> 06:40.160
You saw that, right? So, okay...

06:40.200 --> 06:42.720
People, people, people, people!

06:43.200 --> 06:45.120
I believe we have work to do.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.880
Right. Sorry.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.320
Gear up.

06:58.240 --> 07:04.280
<i>Colonel Caldwell, we just received a subspace
transmission from an SG team on P4M-399.</i>

07:04.320 --> 07:08.080
<i>It's an urgent message from Stargate
Command we are to relay to Atlantis.</i>

07:08.120 --> 07:09.160
What's the message?

07:09.200 --> 07:11.040
<i>Do not dial Gate to Earth.</i>

07:11.080 --> 07:13.880
A Trust operative has planted a bomb in Atlantis,

07:13.920 --> 07:16.960
<i>to be detonated upon completion of dialing sequence.</i>

07:17.000 --> 07:21.640
We are to maintain our position until the message
has been delivered for further intel as it develops.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.200
Are we still in range to relay the message to Atlantis?

07:24.280 --> 07:25.560
<i>No.</i>

07:26.000 --> 07:27.280
<i>Who's that? Kavanagh?</i>

07:27.320 --> 07:28.480
Yes, Colonel.

07:28.520 --> 07:32.280
We're way too far out to broadcast
a subspace transmission to Atlantis.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.360
We could turn around, get closer.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.800
We don't have enough time.

07:35.840 --> 07:39.080
Their weekly status report dial-up
is in just under two hours.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.960
We can't possibly get close enough to broadcast
the message in time to stop them dialing.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.200
Colonel Caldwell,

07:44.440 --> 07:47.240
<i>I believe I can make modifications to the hyperdrive</i>

07:47.280 --> 07:50.000
in order to achieve the speed necessary

07:50.040 --> 07:54.720
to reach a distance capable of relaying
the transmission within the allotted time.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.800
<i>The hyperdrive will be operating</i>

07:57.000 --> 08:02.280
at a level that can only be sustained
for a short duration before damage is incurred.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.560
<i>What kind of damage?</i>

08:03.600 --> 08:05.440
It could burn out the drive.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.680
Meaning we'd be stuck between galaxies.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.320
Yeah, I know what it means, doctor.

08:09.360 --> 08:14.880
However, I do believe that we will reach the point
at which we can relay the message to Atlantis

08:14.920 --> 08:18.120
before damage to the hyperdrive is incurred.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.160
Are you sure about that?

08:20.600 --> 08:24.040
Shall I make the modifications, Colonel?

08:24.160 --> 08:26.400
Go ahead. Turn us around.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.840
I don't see how you can possibly milk
any more power out of the hyperdrive.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.080
Dr. Kavanagh?

08:34.880 --> 08:35.679
Yes?

08:35.960 --> 08:38.600
Stop talking, please.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.039
Thank you.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.400
<i>Are we set to dial?</i>

08:45.440 --> 08:47.680
Almost. Just finishing data compression.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.760
Stand by.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.640
Standing by.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.040
Dr. Novak, what's your status?

09:01.080 --> 09:02.640
Almost in range, Sir.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.520
We're not gonna make it.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.520
Compression's complete. We're good to go.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.520
Alright, then. Dial the Gate.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.280
Yes, ma'am.

09:26.840 --> 09:27.440
Stop!

09:38.120 --> 09:43.760
We need to disconnect the ZedPM and switch to
backup naquadah generators to prevent any
possible dialing of the Gate to Earth.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.480
I agree. In fact, as of this moment,

09:45.520 --> 09:47.160
all Gate activity shall be suspended.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.640
<i>How many off-world teams do we have out there?</i>

09:48.680 --> 09:51.320
Just Zelenka and his team on M7G-677.

09:51.360 --> 09:54.080
Well, unfortunately, he's going to have
to sit tight until we sort this thing out.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.800
Stuck with all those kids...

09:55.840 --> 09:59.120
is the Daedalus still in range to relay
a data transmission back to SGC?

09:59.160 --> 10:02.240
Yes, they are holding a position that keeps
them in range of both Earth and us.

10:02.280 --> 10:06.200
Okay, good, and send a message saying
we received their warning and aborted the dialing.

10:06.240 --> 10:09.640
Ask them if they can give us a little more
than just, "there's a bomb in Atlantis."

10:09.680 --> 10:12.760
Maybe the Trust thinks this is the only way
to make sure the Wraith don't get there.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.560
Well, it's drastic, but effective.

10:14.600 --> 10:20.000
What's worse is the Trust operative who planted the
bomb probably did so under orders from the Goa'uld.

10:20.720 --> 10:21.720
What?

10:21.760 --> 10:23.960
When did the Goa'uld get involved in this?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.160
Several months ago.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.800
<i>They successfully infiltrated
the upper leadership of the Trust,</i>

10:27.840 --> 10:31.800
gaining a stronghold on Earth accessing
government agencies from many countries.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.520
What's a Goa'uld?

10:33.560 --> 10:39.200
It's a slimy, snake-like alien creature, burrows into
people's heads and takes control of their bodies.

10:39.240 --> 10:40.480
That doesn't sound pleasant.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.720
<i>It isn't.</i>

10:41.760 --> 10:44.720
I've read enough SG mission reports to know
I don't want anything to do with them.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.760
I want you to organize some teams
and do a search of the City.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.440
Start with obvious sabotage points,
power distribution centers.

10:49.480 --> 10:53.800
I'll check primary and secondary systems for
any anomalous energy readings that might
indicate the presence of an explosive device.

10:53.840 --> 10:56.800
And get Cadman to assist you,
she's a bomb expert.

10:57.000 --> 10:57.880
She is?

10:57.920 --> 10:59.400
She's one of the best. She'll be a big help.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.160
Good.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.520
Ask colonel Caldwell to return to
Atlantis to assist with the investigation.

11:03.920 --> 11:07.040
If the Daedalus returns here, then you're
effectively cutting off our communication with Earth.

11:07.080 --> 11:11.080
Yes, I understand that, but if the person
who planted the bomb is on board,
we gonna need to question them here,

11:11.120 --> 11:14.000
<i>have them reveal the location of the bomb
and how to dismantle it.</i>

11:14.760 --> 11:16.160
Alright, let's get moving.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.320
Disconnecting ZedPM power...

11:31.720 --> 11:32.720
now.

11:41.640 --> 11:45.200
Charin, if you don't mind,
I'd like to draw a wee bit of your blood.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.840
If you must.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.920
When you are done,
I have made some tuttleroot soup.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.400
You, cooking?

11:54.440 --> 11:55.800
Tuttleroot?

11:55.840 --> 11:56.720
Yes...

11:56.920 --> 11:58.840
<i>I have been practicing.</i>

11:58.880 --> 12:00.400
Hopefully,

12:00.520 --> 12:01.720
some day,

12:01.760 --> 12:04.920
I will be able to cook as well as you.

12:11.800 --> 12:17.320
I am afraid that day is far into the future, my dear.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.920
You were born for a higher purpose,

12:23.960 --> 12:27.680
to be the leader of our people...

12:28.800 --> 12:35.920
and that's why I want you
to prepare them for the ring ceremony.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.760
Charin...

12:39.360 --> 12:42.000
I'm dying, Teyla.

12:42.840 --> 12:46.560
Forgive me, but... what exactly is the ring ceremony?

12:50.400 --> 12:56.680
Among our people, it is very rare
for someone to die of natural causes.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.720
Because of the Wraith?

13:00.320 --> 13:03.760
The ring ceremony celebrates such an event.

13:03.800 --> 13:06.760
A ring of stones is laid out,

13:06.800 --> 13:08.960
symbolizing the ring of the ancestors,

13:09.000 --> 13:10.640
the Stargate,

13:10.680 --> 13:15.000
in the center of which the body is placed, and...

13:22.120 --> 13:26.080
I am not ready for this ceremony, Charin.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.600
Not yet.

13:36.840 --> 13:37.680
<i>What do you got for me?</i>

13:37.720 --> 13:39.600
<i>One of our teams just raided a Trust compound,</i>

13:39.640 --> 13:42.400
discovered computers containing
further intel on Atlantis.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.400
It's not much,
the Goa'uld are being very cryptic about this.

13:44.440 --> 13:47.000
Cut to the chase. Do we know what kind of bomb it is?

13:47.040 --> 13:47.680
Not yet.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.400
Do we know where in the City it was planted?

13:49.440 --> 13:49.960
No.

13:50.080 --> 13:50.800
I'm sorry?

13:50.840 --> 13:52.040
You said "further intel."

13:52.080 --> 13:55.600
Well, we know for sure that there's no
transmitter here on Earth to detonate the bomb.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.080
I thought you said it was connected
to the dialing of the Gate.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.560
It appears that the actual trigger,

13:59.600 --> 14:02.160
be it the Gate itself or some
other mechanism due to the dialing,

14:02.200 --> 14:03.640
is on their end, not ours.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.480
Colonel Carter just came back from off-world.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.320
She's going to help us figure out
what the trigger might be.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.280
So, what else can we do?

14:08.320 --> 14:09.160
Nothing.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.000
I mean, not until we find out more.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.840
Then by all means, don't let me stop you.

14:19.160 --> 14:20.160
<i>Colonel Caldwell,</i>

14:20.200 --> 14:22.800
<i>we received another message from SGC to relay.</i>

14:22.840 --> 14:24.800
It looks like the detonator is not on Earth,

14:24.840 --> 14:26.080
but it is in Atlantis.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.040
Alright, go ahead and send it.

14:31.080 --> 14:35.080
Also let SGC know of Dr. Weir's request that
we return to help with the investigation.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.240
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

14:39.280 --> 14:41.000
<i>Explosives expert?</i>

14:41.400 --> 14:44.560
High temperature and energetic materials technology.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.160
And I can tap dance, too.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.160
Colonel Sheppard, how's it going?

14:49.200 --> 14:51.400
<i>Checking the east pier power distribution centers.</i>

14:51.440 --> 14:52.360
Still nothing.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.200
We're headed to the west pier now.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.600
Ronon...

14:56.800 --> 14:57.920
<i>How about you?</i>

14:59.240 --> 15:01.120
Checking the grounding stations.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.240
Also nothing.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.640
We've got eight other teams out there.

15:04.680 --> 15:06.280
It's a big city. It's going to take a while.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.320
<i>Understood.</i>

15:07.360 --> 15:10.520
Be advised we got a second message relayed to us...

15:11.880 --> 15:13.080
DHD...

15:13.520 --> 15:14.880
It's dialing itself.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.640
That's Earth's address.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.560
I thought it couldn't dial Earth without the ZPM.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.800
Well, it can't.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.520
<i>Did I just hear right?</i>

15:33.560 --> 15:34.760
The Gate dialed by itself?

15:34.800 --> 15:36.680
Yes, it tried to dial Earth.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.000
Whoever planted the bomb must've devised a program

15:39.040 --> 15:41.400
to upload itself
and automatically dial the Gate as backup

15:41.440 --> 15:43.200
in case the first dial-in was halted.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.000
A very good thing you pulled the ZPM.

15:45.040 --> 15:45.800
- Rodney...
- What?

15:45.840 --> 15:46.880
The transmitter...

15:47.720 --> 15:48.800
Oh, no.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.000
What is this?

15:52.400 --> 15:54.520
We just started broadcasting a distress beacon.

15:54.560 --> 15:57.600
<i>The Gate dialed itself in order to draw
attention away from the transmitter.</i>

15:57.640 --> 15:58.320
Turn it off!

15:58.360 --> 15:59.400
I am.

16:03.680 --> 16:04.600
<i>It's too late.</i>

16:05.040 --> 16:06.400
The damage is already done.

16:06.440 --> 16:08.600
The two Wraith cruisers I was monitoring,

16:08.640 --> 16:10.600
they picked up the beacon.
They've altered their course.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.760
They're headed straight for Atlantis.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.880
<i>How long before they get here?</i>

16:20.920 --> 16:22.480
<i>A day, maybe a day and a half,</i>

16:22.520 --> 16:24.840
depending on if they need to make
a hyperspace pause along the way.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.120
We'll need to cloak the City again.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.640
Even cloaked, the Wraith are going to wonder
where the beacon came from.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.840
Well, then we need a ruse.

16:32.760 --> 16:36.720
We'll take a transmitter and dump it along with
some charred rubble on a beach on the mainland,

16:36.760 --> 16:40.080
and they'll think it's jetsam that washed up
when the City exploded during the siege.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.640
Hang on. Back up a second.
Let me get this straight...

16:41.680 --> 16:43.320
you think our bomb guy did this?

16:43.360 --> 16:45.560
Yes. It'd be easy to figure out
the Wraith were in the area.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.600
We've been tracking them for a while now.

16:46.640 --> 16:50.000
So he gets the Gate to dial
by itself in order to distract us

16:50.040 --> 16:52.600
so he can broadcast a distress beacon
that would be picked up by...

16:52.640 --> 16:53.400
By the Wraith, yes,

16:53.440 --> 16:54.200
I believe so.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.120
Okay, why?

16:55.160 --> 16:57.960
Well, maybe he wants to blow up
the Wraith along with the City.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.440
Two cruisers...

16:59.480 --> 17:02.320
that's insignificant compared to all
the hive ships that are still out there.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.280
Well, we don't have much time,
so whatever the connection is,

17:05.319 --> 17:07.680
let's try to figure it out
before the cruisers get here.

17:11.480 --> 17:12.480
Teyla...

17:12.560 --> 17:13.720
you're in an awful hurry.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.240
I'm returning to the mainland.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.319
We are evacuating my people back to the City.

17:17.359 --> 17:19.160
Oh, yes, the Wraith are on their way. I just heard.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.280
They will be protected under the cloak
until the danger is passed.

17:22.319 --> 17:25.680
Unfortunately, if they don't find that bomb,
Atlantis may prove even more dangerous.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.480
They will find it.
I am certain.

17:27.520 --> 17:28.400
Before you go,

17:28.440 --> 17:29.920
I need to talk to you about Charin.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.640
I've completed my tests,

17:32.680 --> 17:35.400
and I must say, although she is old,
and her body is indeed failing her,

17:35.840 --> 17:38.720
there are treatments and procedures
I can administer to prolong her life.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.080
Really?

17:40.120 --> 17:41.760
Aye, starting with a pacemaker for her heart.

17:42.680 --> 17:45.680
You see, one of the reasons she's feeling so weak is
that her heart is beating in a...

17:45.920 --> 17:47.520
untimely fashion,

17:47.560 --> 17:49.680
not pumping nearly enough blood through her body.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.480
Now, the condition will continue,

17:51.520 --> 17:54.040
but the pacemaker will slow its progress considerably.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.520
It could possibly add years to her life.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.840
I will let her know,

17:57.880 --> 18:01.440
but first I have to get her and my people
to safety before the Wraith arrive.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.760
Of course.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.200
Not sure I like the look on your face, Chief.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.920
Sir, the Daedalus just relayed a message

18:15.960 --> 18:19.360
informing us that Atlantis requested
they return to help with the bomb investigation.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.840
Well, tell them no for the time being.

18:20.880 --> 18:24.000
I need them to hold position
in case we gather more intel.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.360
<i>Sir, that's the problem.</i>

18:25.800 --> 18:27.440
They already headed back.

18:27.480 --> 18:28.480
They're out of range.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.040
We have no way of communicating
with them or Atlantis.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.800
Then there's nothing else
we can do for them.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.160
No, Sir.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.080
Passenger manifest?

18:54.120 --> 18:55.040
Yeah.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.840
Any names jump out?

18:58.040 --> 19:00.080
A few, actually.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.640
I hate this,

19:02.680 --> 19:04.240
having to suspect one of our own.

19:04.280 --> 19:08.680
Unfortunately, the list of suspects
may not be limited to the Daedalus.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.360
You think the Trust operative might
still be here in Atlantis?

19:13.400 --> 19:14.960
Yeah, with everything that's happened.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.200
Gate dialing by itself,
the distress beacon.

19:19.000 --> 19:19.840
I don't know.

19:19.880 --> 19:24.160
Getting themselves blown up along with the City,
it doesn't seem part of their M.O.

19:24.520 --> 19:26.640
Well, all it takes is one nut to be talked into it.

19:29.680 --> 19:30.760
Okay.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.240
Who around here do you suspect?

19:33.280 --> 19:34.360
What about lt. Cadman?

19:34.960 --> 19:35.440
What?

19:36.120 --> 19:37.200
<i>Hear me out.</i>

19:37.240 --> 19:38.880
She's an explosives expert.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.080
<i>She was all set to leave on the Daedalus,</i>

19:40.120 --> 19:42.280
<i>but asked to stay when "something came up."</i>

19:42.320 --> 19:43.600
She's always around when things happen.

19:43.640 --> 19:48.200
- When the distress beacon started...
- She's one of the most trusted officers in my command,

19:48.240 --> 19:51.080
not to mention the fact that she was
stuck in your head for some time.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.560
Do you always have to keep bringing that up?

19:52.600 --> 19:55.720
I bring it up because you of all people should
know she'd never do something like that.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.040
Well, maybe she was brainwashed?

19:57.080 --> 19:58.720
The Goa'uld are very clever when it
comes to things like manipulating...

19:58.760 --> 19:59.520
Excuse me.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.200
Dr. Weir?

20:01.600 --> 20:02.400
Yes?

20:02.440 --> 20:06.200
Flight just confirmed that the Daedalus
has landed alongside the east pier.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.440
Thank you.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.640
I want to begin the interrogations immediately.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.800
All crew and civilian passengers
have been confined to their quarters

20:16.840 --> 20:18.360
until I have a chance to talk
to each of them sep...

20:18.400 --> 20:21.360
Colonel...
This investigation falls under Atlantis' jurisdiction,

20:21.400 --> 20:23.720
which means it will be conducted under my command.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.960
Now, I welcome your assistance,
but as far as questioning potential suspects...

20:27.000 --> 20:30.960
Doctor, one of the people aboard my
ship may be an operative of the Trust.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.320
Yes, and the sooner I figure out who that is,
the better for all of us.

20:36.440 --> 20:37.720
Alright, who's first on your list?

20:38.640 --> 20:40.080
You think I did it?

20:40.120 --> 20:41.240
Relax, doctor.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.640
You're just one of many people I'm questioning.

20:43.960 --> 20:44.720
No,

20:44.920 --> 20:48.240
I'm pretty sure mine's the first name
on what is probably a very short list.

20:48.280 --> 20:51.760
Shortly after the siege,
you couldn't wait to leave Atlantis.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.880
A few months later,
I received an urgent request from you

20:54.920 --> 20:56.520
to be allowed to return.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.040
Your second tour lasted three weeks,

20:59.080 --> 21:00.720
and suddenly, you ask to leave again.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.600
Because working conditions
became intolerable for me here.

21:03.640 --> 21:06.400
I have no friends here,
my work is not respected...

21:06.440 --> 21:10.320
and this occurs only days before we discover
a bomb has been planted in the City.

21:11.720 --> 21:12.960
Right.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.320
Of course, so

21:14.400 --> 21:16.080
obviously I did it.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.600
Given the circumstances,
can you not see how such behavior might

21:19.640 --> 21:22.000
- arouse suspicion?
- Your suspicion, sure.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.400
Seeing as how you never cared for me

21:23.440 --> 21:25.920
nor valued the talents I brought to this expedition.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.320
My personal feelings towards you,
no matter what they may be,

21:29.920 --> 21:31.600
have nothing to do with this.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.600
Please.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.440
Everything you do is motivated by personal feelings.

21:38.480 --> 21:41.000
You're driven by emotion, not reason.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.400
It's why I've always felt you're
not capable of doing this job.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.400
You don't have the...

21:46.760 --> 21:47.920
strength...

21:48.080 --> 21:50.080
to be leading the fight against the Wraith.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.080
If I remember correctly,
you were the one who wanted to,

21:52.120 --> 21:53.640
what was it, run and hide?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.480
And at the time, I was right.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.600
<i>If the Daedalus hadn't arrived at the 11th hour,</i>

21:58.640 --> 22:03.280
this city and everyone in it would have
been wiped out because of your recklessness.

22:03.840 --> 22:07.520
There's no need for the Trust to blow
it up when Dr. Weir's at the helm.

22:11.400 --> 22:14.600
Most of the others have already
been transported to the City.

22:14.640 --> 22:18.320
A medical team will be by shortly
to take you in the next Jumper.

22:19.920 --> 22:22.160
<i>Always running.</i>

22:22.760 --> 22:26.760
Always looking to the sky in fear.

22:28.320 --> 22:31.680
Soon I shall be free of this burden.

22:32.760 --> 22:33.920
Charin...

22:36.360 --> 22:39.800
Dr. Beckett said he can help you,

22:40.640 --> 22:43.720
give you something to make you feel better,

22:43.760 --> 22:45.240
live longer.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.080
I feel fine, Teyla.

22:48.120 --> 22:52.800
I welcome this.
This is not to be feared.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.880
You are all I have left.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.760
My family, my...

22:59.200 --> 23:01.040
mother, my father...

23:01.320 --> 23:03.240
they are all gone.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.280
If you leave me...

23:07.400 --> 23:10.160
I will truly be alone.

23:10.200 --> 23:14.360
No, your people are your family, Teyla...

23:16.080 --> 23:23.040
and as you look to them,
so they will look to you.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.520
They need your strength...

23:30.240 --> 23:33.680
You understand that I am interviewing
everybody onboard the ship.

23:33.720 --> 23:35.200
Oh, sure, I know.

23:35.240 --> 23:39.120
I mean, whoever planted the bomb was
probably eager to get away from the City!

23:39.160 --> 23:40.920
Not that I was eager.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.720
I was just doing my job.
I couldn't have cared less when we left...

23:44.800 --> 23:47.800
but I care about my job. I just didn't...

23:50.160 --> 23:51.640
You were saying?

23:51.680 --> 23:54.280
Doctor, you have nothing to be nervous about here.

23:54.960 --> 23:56.000
No, I know.

23:56.040 --> 23:59.000
Unless, of course, I was guilty.
Then I would have someth...

24:01.440 --> 24:02.480
Sorry.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.000
Have you noticed any crew members...

24:07.400 --> 24:10.120
change in behavior the last few weeks?
I don't know,

24:10.160 --> 24:12.720
anybody acting in a suspicious or odd manner?

24:12.760 --> 24:14.600
No... Wait.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.960
I... I mean, no.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.600
For God's sake.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.240
Can I get you some water?

24:22.280 --> 24:23.680
Oh, no. It wouldn't do any good.

24:24.120 --> 24:27.840
I get the hiccups when I'm nervous.
It goes way beyond annoying.

24:29.240 --> 24:30.240
But wait.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.840
The pony-tailed guy.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.040
Dr. Kavanagh?

24:34.080 --> 24:36.880
He was always hanging around,
looking over your shoulder,

24:36.920 --> 24:39.160
poking through computers.
Kind of creepy.

24:41.800 --> 24:45.680
Well, not really creepy as much as...

24:45.720 --> 24:47.640
peculiar, maybe?

24:47.680 --> 24:50.080
I... I don't know the guy.
He could be a great person.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.160
I mean, who am I to judge, you know?

24:52.200 --> 24:54.120
I'll just shut up now.

24:54.560 --> 24:55.360
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

24:55.400 --> 24:57.160
Excuse me. Yes, Rodney?

24:57.200 --> 25:00.320
<i>Can you come to the control room?
We have discovered something important.</i>

25:01.680 --> 25:04.000
I'm on my way.
If you'll excuse me.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.000
Yes, Sir.

25:05.440 --> 25:06.280
Ma'am...

25:13.080 --> 25:14.040
What have you found?

25:14.080 --> 25:16.600
Guess what? Turns out there's no bomb after all.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.520
There's no actual explosive device.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.120
The explosion will come, but from somewhere else.

25:21.160 --> 25:24.600
Now, with the Wraith on the way,
we'll need to cloak the City,

25:24.640 --> 25:25.760
- right?
- Yes.

25:25.800 --> 25:29.040
In order to do that, we need to reconnect the ZedPM
in order to supply the necessary power.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.120
And what about the Stargate?

25:30.160 --> 25:31.960
I've physically disabled the DHD.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.760
It won't be able to dial, so it won't be a problem.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.760
Now, the ZedPM, however, will be.

25:35.800 --> 25:36.400
<i>Now, as you know,</i>

25:36.440 --> 25:39.360
the zero point module controls the
flow of massive amounts of power.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.000
Like a dam.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.200
No. It's not like a dam, it's more like a...

25:42.240 --> 25:44.800
actually, yes, it's like a dam.
If you overload the dam, it breaks,

25:44.840 --> 25:47.960
which is why the Ancients put in place failsafes
to prevent such a thing from happening.

25:48.000 --> 25:48.840
Like a spillway.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.000
Could we just stick with failsafes?

25:51.840 --> 25:56.680
The problem is, our Trust operative figured
out a way to rewrite Atlantis' operating
system and disable the failsafes,

25:56.720 --> 25:59.920
but mask it in such a way that
the City's sensors didn't detect it.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.720
So the dialing of Earth would
cause the ZPM to overload.

26:02.760 --> 26:03.680
Oh, yeah,

26:03.720 --> 26:08.120
and given that dialing another galaxy
requires tremendous amounts of power,
we're talking catastrophic overload.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.480
The explosion would destroy not just the City,
but most likely the entire planet.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.960
Can the failsafes be re-enabled?

26:13.000 --> 26:19.560
Yes, but whoever it was who did this anticipated
the possibility they would be discovered, and they
put in place a code to block access to it.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.280
And I'm gonna guess that cracking
this code isn't going to be easy.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.640
No, not at all.
It is extremely complicated.

26:24.680 --> 26:28.360
But for now, you've already disabled the DHD,
so it's impossible to dial Earth.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.480
Yeah, but unfortunately,

26:29.520 --> 26:33.520
any number of systems can be used in
conjunction with each other to overload the ZedPM.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.560
It'd be a much more gradual
build-up than dialing the Gate,

26:35.640 --> 26:39.360
which would cause an instantaneous power spike,
but equally as effective in its results.

26:39.400 --> 26:43.880
And we can't disconnect the ZPM because we need
the cloak for when the Wraith cruisers arrive.

26:43.920 --> 26:44.480
Bingo!

26:44.520 --> 26:47.800
Which is why our bomber activated
the distress beacon, alerting them,

26:47.840 --> 26:53.200
and that is how the Wraith coming to Atlantis
is connected to detonating the bomb.

26:57.960 --> 27:03.360
Rewriting Atlantis' operating system and
disabling the failsafes, well, that takes
someone with incredible intelligence.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.720
You mean like Dr. McKay?

27:05.840 --> 27:11.280
And also someone who was very eager to leave
Atlantis shortly before the weekly dial-in to Earth.

27:11.320 --> 27:13.160
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,

27:13.200 --> 27:16.640
but isn't Dr. Zelenka currently
stuck off-world somewhere?

27:16.680 --> 27:18.000
Why isn't he a suspect?

27:18.040 --> 27:20.480
Our list of suspects isn't open for discussion,

27:20.520 --> 27:21.800
but off the record,

27:21.840 --> 27:25.360
Zelenka went against his will,
and I couldn't picture him working for the Trust.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.600
Oh, but you could picture me?

27:26.640 --> 27:28.160
In a heartbeat.

27:30.960 --> 27:32.240
I see...

27:34.280 --> 27:36.520
guilty until proven innocent.

27:36.560 --> 27:38.840
<i>I've been going over
the communication logs from the Daedalus,</i>

27:38.880 --> 27:45.320
and it seems that you sent three unauthorized
and coded messages back to Atlantis shortly
after the dial-in was halted.

27:45.360 --> 27:48.760
I have a few friends here I was concerned
about I wanted to see if they were right.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.480
I thought you said you didn't have any friends here.

27:53.600 --> 27:57.360
Now, the messages were encrypted, but don't worry
I've got people deciphering them right now.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.760
What do you want from me?

27:58.800 --> 28:02.560
I want the access code
so I can re-enable the ZPM failsafes!

28:02.600 --> 28:07.120
Well, if you're waiting for me to tell you,
you'll be waiting a while, seeing
as I have no idea what that code is.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.560
No, I think you do know it,

28:08.600 --> 28:10.680
and since I don't have the time to wait anymore,

28:10.720 --> 28:14.440
I'll just have to decide
the quickest way to get it from you.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.000
Like what?

28:16.040 --> 28:18.400
Are you gonna torture me?

28:26.040 --> 28:28.200
Could the cloaking cause the ZPM to overload?

28:28.240 --> 28:33.440
Yes, but I can turn off some of the systems
to keep the power level short of an overload.

28:33.480 --> 28:36.080
Maybe we should start thinking
about evacuating the City.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.680
<i>There's not a lot of options there.</i>

28:37.720 --> 28:39.840
Still, it can't hurt to have a plan ready,

28:39.880 --> 28:42.080
if we can think of one.

28:44.680 --> 28:45.880
Dr. Beckett...

28:45.920 --> 28:48.000
why was Charin moved in here?

28:48.280 --> 28:49.800
So I can keep a closer eye on her,

28:49.840 --> 28:50.880
tend to her if needed.

28:50.920 --> 28:53.800
I told you, she does not wish for any treatment.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.560
You have to understand, Teyla,

28:56.600 --> 28:59.800
that as a doctor,
I can't just stand by here and let her die.

28:59.840 --> 29:02.600
I took an oath to preserve life.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.920
You may keep her here to make her comfortable,

29:04.960 --> 29:06.360
but if the time comes,

29:06.600 --> 29:11.720
as much as it pains both of us,
we must not interfere.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.760
Alright.

29:16.600 --> 29:21.440
I'm still working on cracking the new failsafe code.
But so far, no luck.

29:21.480 --> 29:24.840
How are things coming with Kavanagh?
Is he still your prime suspect?

29:25.160 --> 29:26.560
Yes, he is.

29:26.600 --> 29:28.240
I'm having some difficulty with him, though.

29:28.280 --> 29:30.320
He's not exactly the most cooperative of people.

29:30.360 --> 29:31.800
Well, there's a shocker.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.160
If he does know the code,

29:33.200 --> 29:35.680
I highly doubt he's going to just give it to us.

29:36.160 --> 29:38.000
Give me 10 minutes with him.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.800
I'll get it out of him.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.480
It might not be a bad idea.

29:44.520 --> 29:48.160
Maybe it is time to take this
interrogation to the next level.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.720
Look, I hate Kavanagh as much as the next guy,

29:50.760 --> 29:52.800
probably even more, but

29:52.840 --> 29:54.240
we really need to be sure about this.

29:54.280 --> 29:55.280
I agree.

29:55.320 --> 29:57.360
If there's the slightest chance that he's innocent...

29:57.400 --> 29:59.880
We don't have time to debate morality.

29:59.920 --> 30:03.200
Unfortunately, sometimes you have to do
unpleasant things to save lives.

30:15.840 --> 30:17.280
What are you doing?

30:17.640 --> 30:21.440
I was going over the system's
command logs for the past few months.

30:21.480 --> 30:22.080
Why?

30:22.120 --> 30:26.040
I noticed a gap in one of the data-stream
sequences from several weeks ago.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.880
It's probably nothing,
but I thought it might indicate a...

30:27.920 --> 30:29.400
A deletion point, yes.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.680
Believe it or not, I have had some
experience with these systems, more,

30:31.720 --> 30:33.520
say, than a tap-dancing explosives expert.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.040
I was just trying to help, Rodney.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.560
Here's a thought...

30:36.600 --> 30:37.680
failsafe code.

30:37.720 --> 30:39.680
Why don't you help with that?

30:40.440 --> 30:42.120
Elizabeth...

30:43.080 --> 30:44.200
<i>Yes, Rodney?</i>

30:44.240 --> 30:46.080
The cruisers are getting closer.

30:46.120 --> 30:49.160
I think it's time to reconnect
the ZedPM and cloak the City.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.280
<i>Go ahead.</i>

30:56.920 --> 30:59.280
Switching to ZedPM power...

30:59.720 --> 31:00.760
now.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.120
How are we doing?

31:15.160 --> 31:18.600
I've powered down several of
the secondary systems, but so far,

31:18.640 --> 31:21.560
the ZedPM levels are holding below overload.

31:21.600 --> 31:24.320
I think we'll be okay.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.000
Are you in pain?

31:34.760 --> 31:38.200
Dr. Beckett can give you something to ease it.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.560
Teyla...

31:47.480 --> 31:49.640
Yes, Charin.

31:51.520 --> 31:54.840
The journey begins.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.840
They're here.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.440
Two Wraith cruisers just outside our atmosphere.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.680
So far, they're not behaving in a way
that would indicate they're aware of us.

32:35.720 --> 32:36.400
<i>Rodney...</i>

32:36.440 --> 32:36.960
What?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.520
The City's inertial dampeners just began powering up.

32:39.560 --> 32:40.280
What?

32:40.320 --> 32:42.720
I'm trying to shut it down,
but it's requiring that code.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.560
Get out of there.

32:45.360 --> 32:46.840
It's the star drive.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.760
Look, the City, as you know, is just a giant spaceship

32:49.800 --> 32:51.520
with a star drive capable of faster than-light travel,

32:51.560 --> 32:53.680
<i>which means that it also has inertial dampeners.</i>

32:53.720 --> 32:54.640
Yes, I know that.

32:54.680 --> 32:59.040
One of the precursors to the star drive's power-up
phase is the activation of the dampeners,

32:59.080 --> 33:00.880
which may very well affect our cloak,

33:00.920 --> 33:02.120
but that's not the worst part of it.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.320
It'll overload the ZPM.

33:03.360 --> 33:04.680
Way overload it.

33:06.280 --> 33:08.280
How soon before that happens?

33:08.320 --> 33:11.280
30 minutes at the most,
and this City will be vaporized.

33:15.920 --> 33:18.000
We need to initiate some evacuation plans.

33:18.040 --> 33:20.240
I told you, the Daedalus is our only option.

33:20.280 --> 33:22.400
We can't use the Stargate.
We can't go to the mainland.

33:22.440 --> 33:24.880
I agree... we fit as many people
aboard the ship as we possibly can...

33:24.920 --> 33:27.400
There is nowhere near enough room for everyone.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.280
We're going to have to make room.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.440
<i>No, no, no, you don't understand.</i>

33:29.480 --> 33:32.280
The life support system can't handle that many
people. There's not enough air to go around.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.680
<i>- They'll never make it back to Earth.
- What about another planet?</i>

33:34.720 --> 33:38.800
There's one nearby in this solar system, remember,
the one we found the crashed Wraith cruiser.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.800
That took us 15 hours by Puddle Jumper.

33:40.840 --> 33:42.440
It's a blink of the eye for the Daedalus.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.680
And then we could use the Puddle
Jumpers to ferry the rest of the people.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.640
Quickest thing to do is get the code.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.040
Just let me in with Kavanagh.

33:49.080 --> 33:51.160
I'll get it from him.

33:51.960 --> 33:53.720
ZedPM overload in...

33:53.760 --> 33:56.080
24 minutes.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.080
Do it.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.239
Oh, God.

34:14.120 --> 34:14.880
Teyla,

34:14.920 --> 34:16.239
what are you doing?

34:16.280 --> 34:20.080
We are about to begin the ring ceremony,
according to Charin's wishes.

34:20.560 --> 34:23.480
They're evacuating the City in a matter of minutes.
It could all explode.

34:23.520 --> 34:24.679
We are aware of that,

34:24.719 --> 34:27.480
and many of my people are boarding
the Daedalus as we speak.

34:27.520 --> 34:31.639
I and the others will leave with the final
groups aboard the Puddle Jumpers.

34:31.760 --> 34:34.639
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?

34:35.000 --> 34:36.920
I made a promise to Charin,

34:36.960 --> 34:40.080
and I intend to keep it, no matter the cost.

35:17.360 --> 35:25.640
Beyond the night, a rising sun.

35:25.680 --> 35:32.240
Beyond the night the battle's won,

35:32.520 --> 35:38.240
the battle's won.

35:43.120 --> 35:50.720
<i>Fear and shame now in the past...</i>

35:51.000 --> 35:57.720
<i>pain and sorrow gone at last...</i>

35:58.040 --> 36:03.160
<i>gone at last.</i>

36:09.880 --> 36:12.080
ZedPM overload in 10 minutes.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.840
We should think about getting to the Jumpers.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.840
Dr. Weir, Rodney...

36:21.880 --> 36:23.600
I found something.

36:24.360 --> 36:33.600
Circle renewed, peace will be found

36:33.680 --> 36:44.120
beyond the night on sacred ground

36:45.360 --> 36:46.800
Stop!

36:47.280 --> 36:49.440
What'd you do to him?

36:49.480 --> 36:50.720
Nothing.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.680
He fainted before I could touch him.

36:56.160 --> 37:00.040
Dr. Weir, we're ready to go.
We'll meet you at the rendezvous site.

37:06.160 --> 37:08.000
What the hell's going on here?

37:08.040 --> 37:11.480
I asked Hermiod to beam you here
so you could give us the access code.

37:11.680 --> 37:12.280
What?

37:12.320 --> 37:15.120
Lt. Cadman discovered a gap in the system command logs

37:15.160 --> 37:17.120
that indicated two deletion points, which she and...

37:17.160 --> 37:19.520
We don't have time for this.

37:21.640 --> 37:26.560
Your identification code was used
to access this City's operating system.

37:26.600 --> 37:27.520
You copied it,

37:27.560 --> 37:28.600
took it back to the Trust,

37:28.640 --> 37:32.160
whose Goa'uld scientists then rewrote
the program to overload the ZPM.

37:32.200 --> 37:36.160
You then brought it back here and uploaded
it into the Atlantis computers.

37:36.200 --> 37:37.680
You think that I'm working for the Trust?

37:37.720 --> 37:40.160
We know you're working for the Trust.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.600
So give us the code.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.400
Oh, my God...

37:50.600 --> 37:52.960
I will never give you that code.

37:59.120 --> 38:02.120
I warn you as a Goa'uld, I now possess
the strength of many men.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.400
Won't be a fair fight, then.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.320
Hold on.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.840
Colonel...

38:32.320 --> 38:33.800
<i>Colonel!</i>

38:33.840 --> 38:36.280
Sheppard...

38:36.320 --> 38:39.440
We don't have much time.
We need that access code.

38:47.480 --> 38:50.720
The ZedPM levels are spiking.
We need to go now!

38:51.480 --> 38:53.280
The access code.

39:05.680 --> 39:12.640
River flows, led by the wind

39:13.720 --> 39:20.400
first new breath her journey begins,

39:20.440 --> 39:25.920
her journey begins.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.560
<i>Oh, Carson!</i>

39:36.600 --> 39:39.280
Hermiod's beginning initial
calculations on the extraction.

39:39.320 --> 39:40.640
- Extraction?
- Now?

39:41.200 --> 39:45.560
Hermiod is going to attempt to remove the Goa'uld
from colonel Caldwell using Asgard beaming technology.

39:45.600 --> 39:46.960
Quite remarkable, actually.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
And complicated.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.920
I mean, the calculations are impossibly intricate.

39:49.960 --> 39:52.840
You don't want to go beaming out a chunk of his brain.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.720
Lovely, Rodney.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.000
Look who's back.

39:59.600 --> 40:00.920
Mr. Mom.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.240
Have fun with the kids?

40:04.640 --> 40:07.160
Do not even speak to me.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.520
Did you see Zelenka?

40:24.080 --> 40:25.320
No.

40:25.560 --> 40:28.040
Well, you should take a quick look
before he washes his face.

40:28.080 --> 40:30.480
The kids did a real number on him.

40:32.640 --> 40:36.760
I asked Dr. Beckett to give everyone
in the base a full examination.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.880
If colonel Caldwell could have a Goa'uld in him,

40:38.920 --> 40:40.520
any of us could.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.120
That's not a pleasant thought.

40:43.160 --> 40:44.600
No...

40:44.840 --> 40:46.520
no, it isn't.

40:48.960 --> 40:51.000
I crossed a line, John, with Kavanagh.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.480
You did what you had to do.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.240
Good news was, he wasn't hurt.

40:59.520 --> 41:03.720
Here we are, gloating about
the infighting among the Wraith.

41:03.760 --> 41:06.280
How are we any different?

41:07.305 --> 41:13.244
