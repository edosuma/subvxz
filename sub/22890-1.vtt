42:20.133 --> 42:21.600
there's fire.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.166
- This is not good.
This is bad.

42:23.166 --> 42:25.200
- What are they
[indistinct]?

42:25.200 --> 42:27.533
- These boys are getting away
with murder, if you ask me.

42:27.533 --> 42:29.700
- Bubba, I have
no recollection of this.

42:29.700 --> 42:31.333
- But that doesn't mean
anything.

42:31.333 --> 42:33.033
- If you do decide to
break up with me,

42:33.033 --> 42:35.300
can it not be over tonight?
Please.

42:35.300 --> 42:37.567
[cries]

42:37.567 --> 42:40.333
- I want 100% commitment.

42:40.333 --> 42:42.033
- It's my birthday!

42:42.033 --> 42:43.567
- Get off
your high horse, girl.

42:43.567 --> 42:45.567
- Did you really
just say that?

42:45.567 --> 42:49.133
- Learn your f---ing place,
motherf---er!

42:49.133 --> 42:51.333
- What the f---
are you doing?

42:51.333 --> 42:52.467
- Just say no!

42:52.467 --> 42:54.467
- It's not on my phone!

42:54.467 --> 42:57.533
- Why don't you hand in
your f---ing resignation?

42:59.667 --> 43:01.300
- Is that my phone?

43:01.300 --> 43:03.033
Hey, I need that.

43:03.033 --> 43:04.333
