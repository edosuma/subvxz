00:15.100 --> 00:18.100
My mom says nobody lived here
since old man richmond moved out.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.600
Betcha it's not really haunted.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.700
Go inside and find out.

00:21.700 --> 00:22.300
You go.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.800
You go!

00:23.800 --> 00:25.300
I'll go.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.500
What's the matter? Chicken?

00:30.500 --> 00:32.200
Am not.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.500
Come with me.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.100
Melinda,what are you doing here?

00:57.000 --> 00:57.900
You know,it's late.

00:57.900 --> 00:59.900
You three should be in bed.

00:59.900 --> 01:02.000
We're looking for ghosts.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.600
I can't see them anymore.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.400
sometimes that happens.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.500
You grow out of it.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.700
Can you?

01:14.400 --> 01:15.800
nope.i don't see any.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.200
You can't see ghosts.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.500
You hear them or feel them.

01:19.500 --> 01:20.500
Right.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.700
I did not know that.

01:33.600 --> 01:34.500
what's that?

01:34.500 --> 01:36.300
Is something in there?

01:45.400 --> 01:46.700
Good boy,homer.

01:46.700 --> 01:49.700
The kids would have been disappointed
without a good scare.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.000
Go get it!

01:57.500 --> 01:59.200
I don't get it.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.500
Why does a ghost dog need to go for a walk?

02:01.500 --> 02:04.100
If i could answer that, i could cross him over.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.100
Poor homer.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.400
He's probably just waiting for the ghost kids
from the orphanage

02:08.400 --> 02:10.600
to come back and get him.

02:10.600 --> 02:11.300
thanks.

02:11.300 --> 02:14.300
As if i don't feel bad enough
that he got left behind.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.300
Here's what i think.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.800
If we take the ball and we throw it far enough,

02:17.800 --> 02:20.800
he will keep going until he goes into the light,
right?

02:24.400 --> 02:25.600
What was that?

02:25.600 --> 02:27.300
The kids.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.000
what are you doing?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.400
Hang on a second.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.400
That is private property,right?

02:35.400 --> 02:37.100
mine. I just rented the place.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.100
Don't you have keys?

02:38.100 --> 02:39.600
Lost 'em.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.100
I'm sorry about the noise.

02:43.100 --> 02:44.800
I tried every door,but...

02:50.100 --> 02:51.400
todd darja.

02:51.400 --> 02:52.900
Jim clancy.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.300
This is my wife melinda.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.700
Nice to meet you guys.

02:55.700 --> 02:57.800
So you're moving in now?

02:58.000 --> 02:58.900
I've been real busy

02:58.900 --> 03:01.500
and i don't have much stuff,so...

03:05.700 --> 03:06.500
you need a hand?

03:06.500 --> 03:08.600
No. no.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.900
No.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.700
Ok,then.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.700
If you need anything,

03:13.700 --> 03:15.400
we're right across the street.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.600
Welcome to the neighborhood.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.000
You lose your keys, you call a locksmith.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.900
And who moves in in the middle of the night?

03:27.900 --> 03:30.900
Probably somebody who had to move out
of their last place in the mile of the night.

03:32.300 --> 03:32.900
I don't know.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.300
I think that guy was weird.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.500
Maybe it'll be a short-term rental.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.300
I kind of miss cranky old mr. Richmond.

03:38.300 --> 03:41.000
Maybe he'll come out of retirement and move back.

03:41.700 --> 03:42.700
What?

03:42.700 --> 03:43.600
Homer.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.900
He's growling.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.400
He can't bite me, can he?

03:47.700 --> 03:48.900
Something scared him.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.500
a ghost dog catcher?

04:00.900 --> 04:03.900
Todd's not the only one moving in at night.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.600
Anything?

04:54.600 --> 04:56.800
No. Just todd.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.000
maybe he likes to sleep in?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Very funny.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.900
It's also an angry ghost.

05:04.600 --> 05:05.500
How can you tell?

05:05.500 --> 05:06.800
I can feel it

05:06.800 --> 05:08.800
and see it in the way he moved.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.400
great.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.300
For our new neighbors,

05:11.300 --> 05:13.800
we have the cast of in cold blood.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.300
I should go talk to todd.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.100
Make sure he understands what's going on.

05:17.100 --> 05:18.300
You know,i wouldn't.

05:18.300 --> 05:19.700
Why not?

05:20.100 --> 05:21.900
You never know how people are gonna react

05:21.900 --> 05:22.900
when you tell them what you do.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.700
I always seem to handle it.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.700
because most of the time
you can walk away, right?

05:28.400 --> 05:29.600
And so can the people you help.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.100
But,i mean,this guy lives right across the street.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.200
What if he's got a big mouth,you know?

05:33.200 --> 05:35.400
And starts telling everybody.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.100
You're gonna have to see him every day.

05:37.100 --> 05:38.700
You can't avoid him.

05:38.700 --> 05:39.500
Maybe you're right.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.600
It's rare,but it happens.

05:42.200 --> 05:45.200
I am going to have to have a word with
the departed,though.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.900
Morning,neighbor.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.500
I hope i didn't wake you.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.200
I don't sleep much.

05:59.200 --> 05:59.800
What do you want?

05:59.800 --> 06:02.400
I just wanted to make sure we didn't get off
on the wrong foot last night

06:02.400 --> 06:05.400
and thought maybe you'd like a home-cooked
breakfast.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.900
Thanks.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.300
look, i'd invite you in,but...

06:11.300 --> 06:12.400
that's so nice,

06:12.400 --> 06:14.500
but i can only stay for a minute.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.700
i have always wanted to see the inside of
this place ever since we moved here.

06:19.300 --> 06:20.800
Not much to see.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.400
You travel light?

06:22.400 --> 06:23.300
Move around a lot.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.700
Really?

06:24.700 --> 06:25.900
Where are you from?

06:27.400 --> 06:28.900
Look,...

06:31.100 --> 06:33.300
those are gorgeous fixtures.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.800
Really....

06:35.600 --> 06:37.000
original?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.900
Sure,i guess.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.900
Am i keeping you from work?

06:48.100 --> 06:50.900
I got to buy some things for the house.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.500
What do you do for a living?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.100
Internet.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.200
Website designer.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.200
Listen,

07:01.900 --> 07:02.900
melinda...

07:03.800 --> 07:05.900
i appreciate the breakfast.

07:05.900 --> 07:07.700
I do,but...

07:08.800 --> 07:10.000
i like my privacy.

07:10.000 --> 07:10.700
You understand?

07:13.600 --> 07:14.900
You see me?

07:20.500 --> 07:22.900
Stay away.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.000
What?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.100
Sorry.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.900
Sorry,i was,...

07:29.500 --> 07:32.500
great moldings on that door.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.600
Look...

07:35.600 --> 07:37.800
i really appreciate the breakfast,but...

07:37.800 --> 07:39.500
seriously, i gotta get going.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.800
I understand. Sorry.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.400
I own an antique store...

07:45.600 --> 07:47.300
most earthbound spirits are excited to know

07:47.300 --> 07:50.300
there's someone there they can talk to
and that can see them.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.400
Not this guy.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.400
Maybe this one wants to be left alone.

07:54.400 --> 07:54.900
no.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.700
This ghost is on a mission.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.000
He walks with purpose.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.200
He's evasive,

07:59.200 --> 08:00.900
like he's up to something.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.700
there he is.

08:04.100 --> 08:04.800
He who?

08:04.800 --> 08:06.600
Todd or the ghost?

08:06.600 --> 08:07.800
Both.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.900
Ok,what are you doing?

08:10.900 --> 08:11.900
I'm gonna follow them.

08:11.900 --> 08:13.000
Melinda,stop.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Don't get involved in this.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.900
I'm already involved in this.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.600
There's a ghost living across the street.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.600
You can pretend he's not there.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.800
I can't.

08:19.800 --> 08:20.500
Then i'm going with you.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.400
No,you have work to do, and so do i.

08:22.400 --> 08:22.900
Ok?

08:22.900 --> 08:24.600
I'm gonna try and get the ghost alone

08:24.600 --> 08:26.800
and see if i can't help him move on.

09:55.700 --> 09:56.800
Watch out.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.300
Are you all right?

10:18.300 --> 10:20.000
Why are you following me?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.200
I'm not.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.900
I wasn't.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.000
Never met a ghost who's so proactive before.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.800
Melinda,this one hurt you.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.900
It wasn't like that.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.600
He definitely wants to hurt todd,though.

10:39.600 --> 10:40.900
Like "dead" hurt.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.800
How is that even possible?

10:42.800 --> 10:44.800
I thought spirits couldn't touch anything real,

10:44.800 --> 10:46.400
like a living person.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.100
It's always been that way with earthbounds.

10:48.100 --> 10:49.700
Usually,they move things.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.700
It's like they're learning how to interact more,

10:51.700 --> 10:53.900
make a bigger impact on this world.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.100
Speaking of crossing over,

10:56.100 --> 10:59.100
i have been doing some research into
man's best friend.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.700
This guy is the best dog trainer in the world,

11:03.500 --> 11:05.700
and he says that all dogs have issues.

11:05.700 --> 11:08.600
What kind of issues could homer have
that would keep him here?

11:08.600 --> 11:09.500
Tons.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.000
Phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorders.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Or he's just a dog who doesn't know
he's supposed to walk into the light.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.900
Maybe he thinks the light is a car coming at him.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.800
there's something in here about that.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.900
you keep me posted on that.

11:38.800 --> 11:39.500
What's he doing?

11:39.500 --> 11:41.800
Getting ready for a hurricane?

11:41.800 --> 11:43.200
Trying to lower property values.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.800
I can't decide.

11:48.800 --> 11:49.800
What?

11:49.800 --> 11:51.500
We have to get him off that ladder.

11:51.500 --> 11:52.800
Ok.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.500
it looks like you need up there.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.500
I'm fine.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.900
Can i talk to you for a minute?

11:59.900 --> 12:01.000
It's important.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.200
Why don't you people just leave me alone?

12:03.200 --> 12:03.900
I want privacy.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.400
Don't you get that?

12:05.400 --> 12:06.900
we get it.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.300
Stop it.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.900
Todd?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.100
Todd, can you hear me?

12:32.100 --> 12:33.200
Is he ok?

12:33.200 --> 12:34.900
No. Call 911.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.500
Let him die.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.600
Why?

12:43.600 --> 12:45.200
What is your problem?

12:57.400 --> 12:59.600
keep breathing, you'll be ok.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.400
jim,

13:02.400 --> 13:03.390
is melinda ok?

13:04.600 --> 13:05.200
Why?

13:05.200 --> 13:07.800
Wanted to make sure she didn't get hit
in the head,too.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.900
Bob.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.600
What are you talking about?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.600
He killed my granddaughter.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.100
He's going to get what he deserves.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.100
And if you don't stay out of my way,you will,too.

13:26.900 --> 13:27.900
You ok?

13:27.900 --> 13:29.000
I don't know.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.800
This ghost really wants to kill him.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.600
He thinks that todd murdered his granddaughter.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.700
Wait,...

13:33.700 --> 13:34.600
he's a killer?

13:34.600 --> 13:35.600
I don't know for sure.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.600
Do ghosts lie?

13:36.600 --> 13:37.700
They can make mistakes.

13:37.700 --> 13:38.200
That's it.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.100
You're staying away from this guy.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.300
I'm calling the cops.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.500
And tell them what?

13:41.500 --> 13:42.800
I don't need your help.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.400
no.I can get them to check up on him.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.900
Clark'll do that for me.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.700
Please let me handle this.ok?

13:47.700 --> 13:50.600
Don't do anything until i can get the whole story.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.200
He's home.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.400
The son of a bitch lived,

14:36.400 --> 14:38.200
and he's home again.

14:38.200 --> 14:41.200
It took everything i had to do that to him.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.900
Now i'm too weak.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.500
It's a vicious circle.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.800
You thrive on his energy,

14:49.800 --> 14:52.600
but when he's weakened,so are you.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.500
Whose locket?

14:55.500 --> 14:57.000
My granddaughter's.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.400
I gave it to her for her tenth birthday.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.500
What's the inscription say?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.800
"Patience. "

15:04.500 --> 15:06.800
They buried me with it.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.700
They should've buried her with it,

15:09.700 --> 15:11.900
but they never found her body.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.800
What's your name?

15:15.800 --> 15:18.700
What the hell do you care what my name is?

15:18.700 --> 15:21.300
My granddaughter's dead,

15:21.300 --> 15:22.900
and that bastard killed her,

15:22.900 --> 15:24.200
and he got away with it.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.100
Why do you think he killed her?

15:26.100 --> 15:28.900
I know.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.300
Should've never sent her away.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.300
I didn't know what else to do.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.600
Sent her away where?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.300
Boarding school.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.900
She needed the discipline.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.800
And that's where she met him.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.800
Todd.

15:49.800 --> 15:50.800
He was older.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.700
He had no business befriending her.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
They called me,

15:55.000 --> 15:56.100
they told me she was missing.

15:56.100 --> 15:59.100
They had everybody out there looking
for any sign of her.

15:59.900 --> 16:02.900
That's the first time i ever laid eyes
on todd darja.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.400
Over here.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.700
Found something.

16:13.100 --> 16:15.400
That's all they ever found of her.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.800
The cops knew he killed her.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.000
Why isn't he in jail?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.400
In jail?

16:22.400 --> 16:24.700
They never even made an arrest.

16:24.700 --> 16:25.900
No body.

16:25.900 --> 16:26.800
No evidence.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.700
They could never put a case together.

16:28.700 --> 16:30.900
But my heart was broken.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.500
I should've killed him while i was still alive,

16:34.900 --> 16:37.300
but i promise you,

16:37.300 --> 16:38.500
i promise you,

16:38.500 --> 16:41.500
i will find the strength to make him pay.

16:42.900 --> 16:44.200
Wait.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.800
This is just too weird, mel.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.300
I don't want you near this guy.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.700
This ghost is actively trying to kill him.

17:08.700 --> 17:10.200
I can't turn away.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.200
You know what it's like to have a ghost attached
to you.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.099
This isn't an innocent bystander.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.300
He might be a murderer.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.300
I know what i'm dealing with.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.400
You're overreacting.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.500
And you're underreacting.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.500
People are getting hurt.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.300
I know,

17:20.300 --> 17:22.400
and that's not gonna stop unless i do something.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.400
No,not if it means you're gonna go up close
and personal with todd the ripper.

17:25.700 --> 17:26.800
I'm sorry,mel,

17:26.800 --> 17:28.000
i can't let you do this.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.800
Can't let me?

17:29.800 --> 17:30.500
Come on,

17:30.500 --> 17:31.400
you know what i mean.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.800
I know what you mean.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.500
It's just too dangerous.

17:38.900 --> 17:39.500
Melinda...

17:39.500 --> 17:41.400
i heard ya the first time.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.500
I'm gonna go to bed now,

17:42.500 --> 17:44.200
if you'll let me,that is.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.100
No,don't go making me the bad guy
because i care about you.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.000
Don't get all noble.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.700
There's a difference between caring
and controlling.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.200
Wait,you know i don't do that.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.300
Good night.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.700
All right,fine.

18:02.100 --> 18:03.300
Good night.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.200
that's what i said.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.500
I love you,too.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.100
Is that her?

18:35.100 --> 18:36.900
Missing for 8 years.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.300
Don't you think you should call the police?

18:40.300 --> 18:41.600
And tell them what,

18:41.600 --> 18:43.100
that a ghost told me he's guilty?

18:43.100 --> 18:46.100
Melinda,you saw the guy bury plastic bags.

18:46.300 --> 18:49.300
It'd be stupid to bury evidence in your backyard,
wouldn't it?

18:49.400 --> 18:52.400
We can test his iq after we call the police.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.600
Let me get rid of this ghost,ok?

18:55.500 --> 18:57.800
Then i'll check in with the police.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.900
You have anything yet on homer the dog?

19:02.300 --> 19:04.100
you know,i'm getting close,actually.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.800
This book says dogs are into their pack leaders,

19:06.800 --> 19:07.600
and in this case,

19:07.600 --> 19:09.500
i think you have become homer's pack leader.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.600
And i have to cross over,then he'll follow me?

19:11.600 --> 19:13.100
I said i was close.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.200
I didn't say i had it.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.200
Ok,according to the book,

19:20.200 --> 19:21.900
dogs are very migratory.

19:21.900 --> 19:23.400
They like to go w places,

19:23.400 --> 19:24.800
try new things,

19:24.800 --> 19:26.900
travel,shop.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Wait,that's me.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.500
-It's him.
-Who? Homer?

19:30.500 --> 19:32.400
My next-door neighbor.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.200
Keep an eye on him.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.200
The minute he gets back in his truck,

19:35.200 --> 19:36.300
call me on my cell.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.000
Why?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.700
Where are you going?

19:39.200 --> 19:40.500
Melinda!

21:15.000 --> 21:15.500
Andrea?

21:15.500 --> 21:16.400
Get out of there.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.600
How long ago did he leave?

21:17.600 --> 21:18.100
I don't know.

21:18.100 --> 21:18.900
I'm swamped,

21:18.900 --> 21:20.000
i was ringing up customers,

21:20.000 --> 21:20.600
and when i looked,

21:20.600 --> 21:21.500
his truck was gone.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.900
ok.thanks

21:35.300 --> 21:37.900
You just can't mind your own business,can you?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.700
it was my dog homer.

21:42.700 --> 21:45.500
I thought his ball had rolled in here,

21:45.500 --> 21:48.500
but i don't see it anywhere,so...

21:49.200 --> 21:50.900
i'll help you look for it.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.400
What's the matter?

21:53.800 --> 21:55.200
Are you scared?

21:56.100 --> 21:57.700
Just like everybody else.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.800
L... i should go.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.500
Please,just let me go.

22:09.900 --> 22:10.600
Do what i say,

22:10.600 --> 22:12.600
and everything'll be ok.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.600
Why are you doing this?

22:14.600 --> 22:15.600
Because i'm haunted.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.300
There's something in here with us right now.

22:17.300 --> 22:19.000
You hear that?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.900
He thinks i'm some thing.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.900
He doesn't know who i am.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.400
Now that you're here,

22:24.400 --> 22:25.300
you can tell him.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.500
No.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.300
You shouldn't have come in here.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.100
I can only protect myself.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.000
I can't protect you.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.100
Is that what all this is for,protection?

22:33.100 --> 22:34.300
To ward off evil.

22:34.300 --> 22:35.900
Keep the ghosts away.

22:35.900 --> 22:38.600
Talismans and offerings.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.400
I keep 'em buried in the yard

22:40.400 --> 22:42.100
so the spirits don't seep up from below,

22:42.100 --> 22:45.100
but if they do, the incense confuses 'em.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.300
none of this will work.

22:49.300 --> 22:51.800
I will work.I've gotta keep trying.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.400
New things, different things.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.300
Combinations.

22:54.300 --> 22:55.200
Something's gonna work.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.800
Tell him why i'm here.

23:00.800 --> 23:01.400
Stop it.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.000
I can't...

23:02.000 --> 23:03.900
tell him why he's being haunted.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.800
Tell him why he's being haunted!

23:08.300 --> 23:08.900
Tell him!

23:08.900 --> 23:11.700
You're being haunted because of stacy.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.900
How do you know about stacy?

23:27.200 --> 23:29.700
You tell him you know he killed her.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.800
I want you out of here.

23:35.700 --> 23:37.500
Get off my property and leave me alone.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.900
He's a murderer.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.200
Maybe he'll kill you next.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.600
Get away from me!

23:54.200 --> 23:55.900
He's going to die.

23:55.900 --> 23:58.700
Sooner or later,i'll get the strength,
i'll find a way.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.100
You can't save him.

24:00.100 --> 24:03.000
If he dies,you may never find out
what happened to stacy.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.800
I know what happened.

24:06.300 --> 24:07.400
He murdered her.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.800
But you don't know how.

24:08.800 --> 24:09.500
You don't know why.

24:09.500 --> 24:10.200
You don't know where she is,

24:10.200 --> 24:11.900
You don't where he left her.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.900
Those are the things that are keeping you here.

24:13.900 --> 24:16.900
Those are the things you need to
find out to get closure.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.600
He'll never admit to it.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.900
Let me help you.

24:23.600 --> 24:25.900
Please,tell me your name.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.700
Lyle.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.900
Lyle chase.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.500
I'm going to get you.

24:39.700 --> 24:40.800
I'm going to get you!

24:40.800 --> 24:43.800
Going to get you.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.300
that's enough.

24:47.300 --> 24:48.900
That's enough.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.200
All right?

24:50.200 --> 24:52.200
Somebody lives here.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.200
Go find something else to do.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.400
ok,come on guys

24:56.400 --> 24:57.900
And you...

25:04.100 --> 25:06.600
Todd,it's melinda again.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.900
If i could just talk to you for,like,
2 minutes.

25:15.100 --> 25:16.600
Look,i...

25:18.000 --> 25:19.800
i know you're being haunted.

25:20.900 --> 25:22.700
I believe you.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.700
You're not crazy.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.800
I know about these things.

25:29.100 --> 25:30.500
And i know it's been happening to you.

25:30.500 --> 25:33.400
I spoke to the person who's haunting you.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.800
His name is lyle chase.

25:36.100 --> 25:39.100
He wants to know about stacy
and he thinks that you know.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.400
I can help you.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.700
if you'll let me.

25:44.700 --> 25:47.700
But he's not gonna leave you alone until
you tell him what happened.

25:49.800 --> 25:50.900
Todd?

25:51.600 --> 25:53.500
Todd?

26:10.600 --> 26:11.400
Hello?

26:11.400 --> 26:14.000
Do you know the origin of the term graveyard
shift?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.700
I thought you weren't speaking to me.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.700
Back in england in the 1500s,i think,they...

26:19.600 --> 26:21.700
discovered that they'd been burying people
sometimes

26:21.700 --> 26:24.400
that they only thought were dead.

26:25.300 --> 26:28.300
So they started burying them with a little
string tied around their wrist that...

26:29.900 --> 26:31.200
led up through the ground,

26:31.200 --> 26:32.800
you know,to a bell...

26:33.300 --> 26:35.700
that sat in the grass by their grave.

26:35.900 --> 26:38.900
And then someone from the village had
to stay up all night

26:40.200 --> 26:41.700
waiting for a bell to ring.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.300
Graveyard shift.

26:43.300 --> 26:45.200
Dead ringer.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.500
This is the kind of tidbit you're gonna miss
if you stay mad at me.

26:47.500 --> 26:48.700
You were mad at me.

26:48.700 --> 26:50.100
Still am.

26:50.100 --> 26:51.600
A little.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.800
Mel,i can't stand it when things aren't right
with us.

26:55.800 --> 26:58.100
I don't like it when you treat me like
i'm a child.

26:58.100 --> 26:59.500
I don't.

27:01.100 --> 27:02.300
Ok.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.000
But look,are you gonna honestly tell me

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
that i shouldn't feel worried about
what's happening here?

27:08.000 --> 27:09.900
You're gonna tell me that you feel safe?

27:09.900 --> 27:11.800
I have to do what i have to do.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.500
And sometimes,that's not totally safe.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.200
I mean, there's your job,

27:16.200 --> 27:18.800
but i don't tell you that i can't let you do it.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.800
I love you.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.700
And when i think about losing you,i can't...

27:24.700 --> 27:26.800
you have to love what i do.

27:32.100 --> 27:34.500
He's getting ready to go somewhere.

27:34.900 --> 27:36.800
I have to go.

27:37.200 --> 27:37.900
Go where?

27:37.900 --> 27:39.400
Do you trust me?

27:39.400 --> 27:40.300
Yes.

27:40.300 --> 27:41.900
i have to go.

27:41.900 --> 27:43.200
Listen for the bells.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.800
Watch for the dead ringers.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.000
I need you to back off.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.200
I don't wanna let that bastard out of my sight.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.500
I can't connect with him with you in his face.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.400
He can't focus.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.600
I need to do this alone.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.900
You will have your time to talk to him through me.

27:55.900 --> 27:58.500
But not until i've talked to him first.

29:20.100 --> 29:21.800
She's alive.

29:36.700 --> 29:38.700
What are you doing here?

29:39.800 --> 29:41.500
Please, can we just talk?

29:41.900 --> 29:43.400
Todd,who is this?

29:43.400 --> 29:46.400
She's a nosy neighbor from across the street.

29:48.700 --> 29:49.400
But she knows.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.600
What do you mean,she knows?

29:50.600 --> 29:52.100
Knows what?

29:52.100 --> 29:54.000
She says your grandfather is haunting me.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.700
Lyle's the one who's been doing all of this.

29:55.700 --> 29:56.800
My dead grandfather.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.200
He's still here.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.600
And he's attached to todd.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.100
You don't know what it's been like.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.900
She says that lyle thinks that i killed you.

30:02.900 --> 30:03.900
And you believe her.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.100
Your grandfather just wants to know
what happened to you.

30:06.100 --> 30:06.700
We have to tell him.

30:06.700 --> 30:08.700
Don't say anything else, todd.

30:08.700 --> 30:09.900
Just chill out!

30:09.900 --> 30:12.100
Stacy,he's not gonna leave me alone.

30:12.100 --> 30:13.400
This man is trying to kill me.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.200
Your grandfather, he loves you...

30:15.200 --> 30:16.000
he loves me.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.300
Did he love me when he sent me to that place?

30:18.300 --> 30:20.600
I can help you talk to him.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.500
He searched for you. He was heartbroken.

30:22.500 --> 30:24.900
You must be talking about some other lyle chase.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.000
Look,i didn't want to talk to him
when he was alive.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.700
I sure as hell don't wanna talk to him now.

30:29.700 --> 30:30.600
Stacy,please.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.800
I'm not stacy anymore.

30:33.300 --> 30:36.300
Look,my grandfather is dead.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.800
And so's stacy.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.400
Stace...

30:44.000 --> 30:45.800
come on,stacy!

30:57.400 --> 30:59.700
I met stacy my senior year.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.300
She was one tough little girl.

31:02.300 --> 31:04.700
Of course,every other guy tried to hit on her.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.600
But not you.

31:08.400 --> 31:09.200
I'll tell you the truth.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.800
I always thought she was way outta my league.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.900
Did she tell you why she decided
to live with lyle?

31:18.700 --> 31:21.600
Her mother was a drug addict

31:21.600 --> 31:23.900
and they were practically living on the streets.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.800
Her grandfather disowned her mother,
you know,years before.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.900
And when her mom oded,

31:31.500 --> 31:34.400
the old man decided he would take stacy in.

31:35.200 --> 31:36.800
He wasn't ready for her.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.700
That's why he sent her away to boarding school.

31:39.700 --> 31:41.500
Boarding school?

31:41.500 --> 31:43.400
Is that what he called it?

31:43.400 --> 31:44.900
Wasn't it?

31:44.900 --> 31:46.500
It was...

31:46.500 --> 31:48.900
it was a boot camp for kids.

31:48.900 --> 31:51.900
The shelter harbor school for boys and girls.

31:52.100 --> 31:55.100
It was the kind of place where parents would
send their kids to break their spirit.

31:57.300 --> 31:59.500
They come and get you in the middle of the night.

31:59.800 --> 32:02.800
There was this one teacher who really
loved his job.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.400
Mr. Papaso.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.300
Sadistic bastard,

32:09.500 --> 32:12.500
and he wanted to break stacy
in the worst way.

32:19.700 --> 32:22.700
He'd play games with your head and beat you.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.700
Thank you, mr. Papaso,sir!

32:25.700 --> 32:27.400
One more,sir!

32:28.300 --> 32:30.800
On the day she fought back,he...

32:31.500 --> 32:34.300
told her she was going into the observation room.

32:37.800 --> 32:40.400
We all knew that that room was run
by papaso,

32:40.400 --> 32:42.700
and it was just another guaranteed
beating.

32:42.700 --> 32:45.700
She knew she'd never make it through
3 more years there.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.100
So she decided to run away.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.100
I just don't want anybody to come looking
for her.

32:51.100 --> 32:53.700
So you helped her stage her own murder.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.300
That was the last time i saw her.

33:32.700 --> 33:34.600
That's when you became a suspect?

33:34.600 --> 33:36.600
The suspect.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.400
Didn't realize it would be such a
big deal.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.900
We were just stupid kids.

33:39.900 --> 33:42.800
We didn't even know if faking your own
murder was illegal.

33:44.100 --> 33:46.800
Then they started questioning me and...

33:47.000 --> 33:48.900
people were out searching and....

33:49.600 --> 33:51.200
It just got way too big.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.100
No goin' back.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.600
Where did she go?

33:55.600 --> 33:57.700
She's good at taking care of herself.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.200
It's all she'd ever done since she was a kid.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.900
You risked going to jail.

34:03.900 --> 34:06.400
You... kept her secret all this time.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.400
You really love her.

34:12.900 --> 34:14.100
Doesn't matter.

34:15.500 --> 34:18.000
You know,i really changed for both
of us that night.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.699
She had to become somebody else and me,i...

34:21.300 --> 34:23.100
i haven't had a good night's sleep since.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.800
I feel like i'm cursed.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.500
My guts are churning all the time and...

34:32.199 --> 34:34.800
the past 8 years,i haven't lived anywhere
longer than 6 months

34:34.800 --> 34:37.500
because of lyle the friendly ghost.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.699
Maybe it's me who should be dead.

34:41.199 --> 34:42.900
I want my life back.

34:51.600 --> 34:52.699
He's lying!

34:52.699 --> 34:53.800
He's not,lyle.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.500
I saw her for myself.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.900
She's alive and well.

34:55.900 --> 34:57.600
I don't believe it.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.000
I wanna see her.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.500
He doesn't believe it.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.400
I know what we did was wrong,all right?

35:03.400 --> 35:04.500
We didn't know what else to do.

35:04.500 --> 35:05.900
I mean,there was...

35:06.000 --> 35:06.900
nobody there for her.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.300
You weren't there for her.

35:08.300 --> 35:11.100
Shelter harbor was the only place for her!

35:11.100 --> 35:12.800
She was beaten,lyle.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.700
There was a teacher there that singled her out.

35:14.700 --> 35:15.800
She was abused.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.300
I didn't know that.

35:18.100 --> 35:19.800
He said he didn't know that.

35:19.800 --> 35:20.300
That's bull.

35:20.300 --> 35:22.900
You... you signed the papers,lyle.

35:22.900 --> 35:24.100
You gave them permission.

35:24.100 --> 35:25.300
All necessary measures.

35:25.300 --> 35:26.500
Remember that?

35:27.100 --> 35:29.800
And she tried to tell you, but you didn't care!

35:29.800 --> 35:31.200
You're lying!

35:31.200 --> 35:33.500
You're trying to make this all my fault!

35:33.500 --> 35:34.300
You...

35:34.300 --> 35:36.800
you are the one who killed her!

35:36.800 --> 35:37.400
You...

35:37.400 --> 35:38.900
you were the one who killed her!

35:38.900 --> 35:40.000
Stop it!

35:40.000 --> 35:41.700
Now,you stop it!

35:42.100 --> 35:45.100
Stacy is alive and she chose to disappear
because you wouldn't help her!

35:46.100 --> 35:48.200
That is why you lost your granddaughter,all right?

35:48.200 --> 35:50.100
Not because he took her.

35:50.100 --> 35:51.900
I never wanted to hurt her.

35:52.500 --> 35:53.900
Please...

35:55.600 --> 35:56.900
you have to bring me to her.

35:56.900 --> 35:58.300
I want to see her.

35:58.300 --> 36:01.300
Stacy made it very clear she doesn't want
to talk to you.

36:06.500 --> 36:08.700
You have to bring me to her.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.500
Please.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.400
Do you know where she is?

36:20.700 --> 36:21.900
She'll kill me.

36:22.100 --> 36:25.100
You'll finally get your life back.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.200
I don't understand.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.000
Why would she come back here?

36:37.000 --> 36:38.900
It's completely different now.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.600
See,
she saw this as a chance to help kids like her,

36:44.000 --> 36:45.800
help make sure they'd feel safe here.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.700
In a sense, she gives back.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.200
Go on,you guys.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.700
I'll meet you on the field.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.600
She's all grown up.

37:01.300 --> 37:02.500
You shouldn't have done this.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.000
You promised never to come here.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.300
Look,your grandfather is here,all right?

37:06.300 --> 37:08.000
He knows everything that happened,

37:08.000 --> 37:09.600
and he feels terrible.

37:09.600 --> 37:10.900
But he can't...

37:12.200 --> 37:13.500
what's the thing?

37:13.500 --> 37:14.600
Cross over.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.100
He can't cross over until he talks to you.

37:17.100 --> 37:18.700
What are you doing, todd?

37:18.700 --> 37:20.800
Tell her i have her locket.

37:21.300 --> 37:24.000
Your grandfather's telling me that he...

37:24.000 --> 37:25.500
has your locket,

37:25.500 --> 37:27.700
the one that he gave you when you were 10.

37:28.200 --> 37:28.900
You told her about that?

37:28.900 --> 37:30.300
No,i didn't.

37:32.300 --> 37:33.700
What's on the locket?

37:34.500 --> 37:35.600
What?

37:35.600 --> 37:38.600
What's engraved on the locket?

37:38.600 --> 37:39.800
Patience.

37:46.100 --> 37:47.300
He's here?

37:47.300 --> 37:48.700
He can hear you.

37:49.900 --> 37:52.900
You never gave me a chance... grandpa.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.500
I just wanted to matter.

37:56.500 --> 37:57.700
You tell her she did matter.

37:57.700 --> 38:00.700
I thought i had to be tough with you

38:00.900 --> 38:02.800
so you wouldn't end up like your mother.

38:02.800 --> 38:04.800
He was afraid that you'd end up like your mom.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.000
I wanted you to save her,grandpa!

38:07.000 --> 38:09.400
sweetheart, i tried to save her.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.100
I couldn't.

38:10.100 --> 38:11.100
You don't know.

38:11.100 --> 38:13.900
Stacy,people do things and make choices.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.100
Sometimes they have to save themselves...

38:16.800 --> 38:18.100
and sometimes they just can't.

38:18.100 --> 38:19.800
But you did,stace.

38:20.500 --> 38:21.700
You saved yourself.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.700
I would take it all back if i could.

38:24.700 --> 38:26.700
I would do anything.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.800
But look at her.

38:31.300 --> 38:34.300
She grew up strong and she's so beautiful.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.900
She's the picture of her mother.

38:36.900 --> 38:38.800
He wants you to know that he's sorry.

38:39.600 --> 38:42.100
And he would take it all back if he could.

38:42.100 --> 38:44.700
And he's so proud.

38:44.700 --> 38:47.200
He's really proud of who you are

38:47.200 --> 38:49.600
and he thinks you look just like your mother.

38:50.100 --> 38:52.300
I'm so sorry,grandpa.

38:53.100 --> 38:55.700
I should have told you that i was...

38:55.700 --> 38:57.400
ok.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.900
But i just...

38:59.600 --> 39:02.600
i just didn't know what i was doing.

39:02.600 --> 39:03.900
You tell her...

39:05.300 --> 39:06.900
that i love her

39:08.400 --> 39:11.400
and i didn't know how much until she was gone.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.000
What do you see?

39:17.000 --> 39:18.400
It's so bright.

39:18.400 --> 39:19.900
I could touch it.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.700
That means you're ready.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.900
You can cross over.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.900
It's my daughter...

39:29.500 --> 39:30.700
waiting for me.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.700
He sees your mother.

39:32.700 --> 39:33.600
Mom?

39:33.600 --> 39:35.400
She looks so happy.

39:42.800 --> 39:43.900
Thank you.

39:55.300 --> 39:56.500
He's gone.

40:06.800 --> 40:08.700
what's this? You just got here.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.800
Time to move on.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.900
Why? Lyle's gone.

40:13.900 --> 40:16.600
I got an interesting job offer.

40:16.600 --> 40:19.600
Teaching computer to the kids at shelter harbor,
so...

40:21.000 --> 40:22.500
i'll have room and board...

40:22.500 --> 40:23.800
and...

40:23.800 --> 40:24.900
stacy?

40:28.500 --> 40:29.900
stacy.

40:29.900 --> 40:31.700
What about your secret?

40:31.700 --> 40:34.700
We decided to confront it all and let the chips
fall.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.400
