00:02.202 --> 00:04.137
Tonight, on Kitchen Nightmares,

00:04.137 --> 00:06.072
Gordon goes to New Jersey

00:06.105 --> 00:08.308
and somehow ends up
in the tropics.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.210
But this is no paradise.

00:10.243 --> 00:12.412
This part-jungle,
part-restaurant

00:12.445 --> 00:14.681
is in deep financial trouble.

00:14.714 --> 00:16.149
And what makes matters worse,

00:16.182 --> 00:18.718
it is run
by a category five storm...

00:18.751 --> 00:19.719
Girls!

00:19.752 --> 00:21.187
Shut your mouth already!

00:21.221 --> 00:22.722
Named Adele

00:22.755 --> 00:24.657
Who is not fond
of her staff.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.160
Isabelle, you don't know
when to shut up.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.962
Who is disappointed
by her chef.

00:28.995 --> 00:30.000
You just started.
I don't even know how you cook.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.664
You just started.
I don't even know how you cook.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.566
But the person
who drives her nuts...

00:33.600 --> 00:36.302
How can you be positive
about something you hate?

00:36.336 --> 00:38.505
Is Chef Ramsay.
Stop bugging me!

00:38.538 --> 00:43.276
I hate him.
Hate. Hate. Hate.

00:43.309 --> 00:45.612
Tonight, Gordon Ramsay
does his best

00:45.645 --> 00:47.847
to turn around
this New Jersey eatery.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.048
He challenges Adele.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.717
Why have you asked me
to come here?

00:50.750 --> 00:53.019
He confronts
an uncooperative daughter.

00:53.052 --> 00:56.389
You cannot see a problem?
No.

00:56.422 --> 00:58.458
But it all might be
for nothing.

00:58.491 --> 01:00.000
No!

01:00.000 --> 01:00.026
No!

01:00.059 --> 01:01.661
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:01.694 --> 01:03.296
Because this tropical restaurant

01:03.329 --> 01:05.899
Might just be impossible
to save.

01:05.932 --> 01:07.867
Oh, my God.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.770
Sometimes it's hard
to say good-bye to the past.

01:10.803 --> 01:12.872
I am devastated right now.

01:35.128 --> 01:37.196
Whitehouse Station, New Jersey.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.299
A quaint village
surrounded by rich farmland.

01:39.332 --> 01:42.302
It's a popular place
for New York commuters to live.

01:43.603 --> 01:44.671
Bill and Adele

01:44.704 --> 01:47.740
ran successful diners here
for decades.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.343
We made
with the previous businesses

01:50.376 --> 01:52.478
approximately
a million dollars.

01:52.512 --> 01:55.782
I said, "That's it. I'm retired.
I'm done. I'm finished."

01:55.815 --> 01:56.816
Hey, Charlie.

01:56.849 --> 01:58.384
It was nice.

01:59.352 --> 02:00.000
When we retired,

02:00.000 --> 02:01.187
When we retired,

02:01.220 --> 02:03.623
by the third day,
I was bored.

02:03.656 --> 02:05.124
But in 2006,

02:05.158 --> 02:06.926
They came out of retirement

02:06.960 --> 02:08.895
to open their first
fine dining restaurant

02:08.928 --> 02:11.998
with their daughter Cheryl.

02:12.031 --> 02:12.999
Chop chop!

02:13.032 --> 02:14.300
We love Florida.

02:14.334 --> 02:16.836
We love
the tropical atmosphere.

02:16.869 --> 02:20.940
So I thought
Florida-mangos.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.242
Flamangos.

02:23.276 --> 02:28.848
They wanted to be kind
of a, um, high-class restaurant.

02:28.881 --> 02:30.000
And it's hideous.
Hideous beyond belief.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.087
And it's hideous.
Hideous beyond belief.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.459
This restaurant
is very poorly run.

02:39.492 --> 02:40.493
We know!

02:40.526 --> 02:41.694
We have big
problems here!

02:41.728 --> 02:44.297
Adele doesn't respect us.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.331
Girls!

02:45.365 --> 02:46.633
We know!

02:46.666 --> 02:47.667
Adele tells me to shut up

02:47.700 --> 02:48.735
and she's actually cursed.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.503
Shut your  mouth already!

02:52.972 --> 02:56.009
Adele is crazy.

02:56.042 --> 02:58.811
Go! Vamoose.
All right, here I go.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.000
I do the steak.
I do the raw bar.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.648
I do the steak.
I do the raw bar.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.350
I do all the maintenance.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.052
It'sreallyhard.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.054
I get really upset
when I see Bill

03:08.087 --> 03:09.522
having to overwork
like that.

03:09.555 --> 03:10.890
This man should be retired.

03:10.923 --> 03:12.725
I think
they said medium.

03:12.759 --> 03:15.695
Medium rare.
Medium rare.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.664
The food here is fabulous.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.102
You're not going to serve that
to them, are you?

03:23.136 --> 03:24.404
Yep.

03:24.437 --> 03:25.738
I've been a chef
at Flamangos

03:25.772 --> 03:27.140
for about four weeks.

03:27.173 --> 03:29.742
The food right now,
it's less than mediocre.

03:31.511 --> 03:33.479
I definitely wish
I could redesign the menu.

03:33.513 --> 03:34.881
But they don't want me
to change anything.

03:38.284 --> 03:39.652
What do you want me
to do?

03:39.686 --> 03:43.656
Flamangos is doing lousy
and we don't know why.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.826
I can't sleep at night

03:46.859 --> 03:49.862
because I think
of all the money we spent

03:49.896 --> 03:52.265
that would've been
our retirement money.

03:52.298 --> 03:55.168
Taxes are coming up.
Yie. Yie. Yie. Yie.

03:55.201 --> 03:57.403
I see us out in the street,
almost.

03:57.437 --> 04:00.000
If this goes belly-up,
I could lose everything.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.573
If this goes belly-up,
I could lose everything.

04:00.606 --> 04:03.309
How am I gonna start over?

04:03.342 --> 04:07.046
I can't think of anyone else
that could help us

04:07.080 --> 04:09.048
but Gordon Ramsay.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.517
I mean, he cuts right through
the.

04:11.551 --> 04:14.487
And we are in deep.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.429
Whitehouse Station,
New Jersey.

04:23.463 --> 04:25.498
Not exactly the New Jersey
I know.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.433
Look at this place.

04:27.467 --> 04:30.000
I'm here to visit a restaurant
called Flamangos.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.369
I'm here to visit a restaurant
called Flamangos.

04:30.403 --> 04:32.405
There's a long time
before lunch

04:32.438 --> 04:35.074
so I'm gonna visit the family
at home

04:35.108 --> 04:37.810
rather than go straight
to the restaurant.

04:37.844 --> 04:43.683
God. The smell of manure
is strong.

04:43.716 --> 04:45.918
Yoo-hoo!

04:49.689 --> 04:52.825
Wow. That was a road
and a half.

04:52.859 --> 04:54.360
Good morning.

04:54.393 --> 04:56.262
Good morning.

04:56.295 --> 04:57.597
Chef Ramsay.
Uh, Gordon, please.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.831
Good to see you.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.000
Bill, yes?
Good to meet you, sir.
Bill. Yes.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.600
Bill, yes?
Good to meet you, sir.
Bill. Yes.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.635
How old are you?
I'm 70.

05:02.668 --> 05:04.937
You look great for 70.
You know that.
Thank you.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.005
And you're setting this up

05:06.038 --> 05:07.006
for a few year's time

05:07.039 --> 05:08.174
for retirement or what?

05:08.207 --> 05:09.575
Well, I'm supposed
to be retiring now,

05:09.609 --> 05:11.844
but I bought
a restaurant instead.

05:11.878 --> 05:14.247
And now I'm broke.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.348
Oh, jeez.

05:15.381 --> 05:16.816
you honestly
came out of retirement...

05:16.849 --> 05:18.251
I came out
of retirement.

05:18.284 --> 05:19.852
To open a restaurant.
To open a restaurant.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.622
I had restaurants before.
I had about four of them before.

05:22.655 --> 05:25.258
Uh-huh.
And I made a lot of money
with them.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.126
But this one is--

05:27.159 --> 05:28.594
I don't know
what's the matter with it.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.000
I need Chef Ramsay's help
to try to make this

05:30.000 --> 05:31.664
I need Chef Ramsay's help
to try to make this

05:31.697 --> 05:35.668
a successful restaurant
for Cheryl and Adele.

05:35.701 --> 05:37.637
I'd like you to meet
Chef Ramsay.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.038
How are you?
Oh. Oh.

05:39.071 --> 05:41.040
Gordon. Nice to see you,
my darling.

05:41.073 --> 05:42.542
The big question for me

05:42.575 --> 05:44.010
is "Have you had
a restaurant?"

05:44.043 --> 05:46.212
Yeah. we started diners.
so then you sell them.

05:46.245 --> 05:47.647
You go into retirement.
Right.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.915
Why would you come
out of retirement

05:48.948 --> 05:50.316
to buy another restaurant?

05:50.349 --> 05:51.784
We wanted to do this
as a family.

05:51.817 --> 05:53.819
My daughter Cheryl
and myself.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.721
Would you like
to meet Cheryl?
Please.

05:55.755 --> 05:57.523
Cheryl!

05:58.691 --> 05:59.692
Hello.
Hello.

05:59.725 --> 06:00.000
Good to meet you.
Good to meet you.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.194
Good to meet you.
Good to meet you.

06:02.228 --> 06:04.664
Now do you just pop over
for a slice of cake?

06:04.697 --> 06:08.401
No. I live here.
You live here.

06:08.434 --> 06:09.602
Yes.

06:11.504 --> 06:14.206
How old are you?
I'm 42 years old.

06:15.975 --> 06:18.110
Same age as me.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.780
I left mum 24 years ago.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.448
What are you still
doing here?

06:22.481 --> 06:27.119
I haven't had a paycheck
in two years.
Right.

06:27.153 --> 06:28.220
I have to live home.

06:28.254 --> 06:29.322
My daughter Cheryl,

06:29.355 --> 06:30.000
she'sstillliving with us.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.490
she'sstillliving with us.

06:31.524 --> 06:33.960
But she doesn't bring
anyone home.

06:33.993 --> 06:36.128
No guys. Forget that.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.564
Okay. Should we get
to the restaurant?
Sure.

06:38.598 --> 06:39.632
Let me drive you there.

06:39.665 --> 06:41.167
Let's go on a little
scenic route, yeah?

06:41.200 --> 06:42.335
All right.
Yeah?

06:42.368 --> 06:44.170
Oh, boy.
Let's go, princess.

06:44.203 --> 06:45.938
Okay.

06:47.773 --> 06:51.210
So tell me who came up
with the word "Flamingos."

06:51.243 --> 06:53.879
No, it's "Flamangos."
Flamingos.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.382
Flamangos.
Who--Flamingos.

06:56.415 --> 06:57.617
Flamangos.
Flamingos.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.585
It's Flamangos.
Not flamingos.

06:59.619 --> 07:00.000
Flamangos.
F-l-a...

07:00.000 --> 07:01.554
Flamangos.
F-l-a...

07:01.587 --> 07:03.155
F-l-a--mangos.

07:03.189 --> 07:06.092
Not Flamingos.
Not Flamancos.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.494
Flamangos.
Yeah, Flamangos.

07:08.527 --> 07:10.763
Restaurant in New Jersey.
Yeah, why not?

07:10.796 --> 07:13.566
Are you  crazy?

07:13.599 --> 07:16.636
there you are.
thank you so much
for the lift.

07:18.237 --> 07:20.740
Wow. Florida mango.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.846
- Wow. Wow.
- Good afternoon, sir.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.014
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

07:28.047 --> 07:30.000
Oh, my God.
It's like a zoo in here.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.082
Oh, my God.
It's like a zoo in here.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.884
Yeah, well, it is tropical.

07:31.917 --> 07:33.319
Who designed it?

07:33.352 --> 07:34.920
My daughter decorated it.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.355
Amazing.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.991
How drunk was she when she put
the final sketches together?

07:39.025 --> 07:40.593
We do like the tropics.

07:40.626 --> 07:44.230
I don't see anything wrong
in bringing tropical

07:44.263 --> 07:45.531
to Whitehouse Station.

07:46.732 --> 07:49.068
This is Jodi.
She's going to take care of you.

07:49.101 --> 07:50.569
Okay. Brilliant.
Thank you, Adele.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.204
Where do you start
this one?

07:52.238 --> 07:53.873
It's endless.

07:53.906 --> 07:56.142
Okay, um, let's start off

07:56.175 --> 07:57.443
with ahi tuna

07:57.476 --> 07:59.245
on the flaming tiki platter.

07:59.278 --> 08:00.000
A tiki.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.479
A tiki.

08:00.513 --> 08:01.547
And then I'll end up

08:01.580 --> 08:02.682
with that tsunami

08:02.715 --> 08:03.983
of filet mignon.

08:04.016 --> 08:05.184
Okay.
Thank you.

08:05.217 --> 08:08.788
Okay, this is for
Chef Ramsay.
Oh, all right.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.123
I think Chef Ramsay's mouth's
gonna drop to the floor

08:11.157 --> 08:12.992
when he sees a few of the things
on the menu.

08:13.025 --> 08:14.026
Our tuna appetizer.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.464
Thank you.
Enjoy.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.405
Is that always that hot
in terms of spicing?

08:26.439 --> 08:29.442
They have a tendency
to spice things up a bit.

08:29.475 --> 08:30.000
It's an embarrassment
to tuna.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.110
It's an embarrassment
to tuna.

08:31.143 --> 08:32.144
Yes.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.245
Ask Cheryl to taste
that other

08:33.279 --> 08:34.447
little end there.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.248
I will.
Thank you, my darling.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.951
Bryan, Cheryl, Chef Ramsay
would like you guys

08:38.984 --> 08:41.787
to taste the tuna,
it is really spicy.

08:41.821 --> 08:44.123
I've been saying it
since I got here.
Never had a problem.

08:44.156 --> 08:45.624
Doesn't matter
if you love it or not.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.960
Everybody else--four times
I've gotten complaints

08:47.993 --> 08:49.562
about being spicy.
so he's--he's done
with it.

08:49.595 --> 08:51.063
Ribs are destroyed.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.498
Sunday we made those.

08:52.531 --> 08:53.566
That's a week.

08:53.599 --> 08:55.501
Four days. Whatever.

08:55.534 --> 08:56.802
Send it. Just send it out.
Send it out.

08:58.504 --> 09:00.000
Wow, I see platters like that,
I hear Hawaiian music.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.174
Wow, I see platters like that,
I hear Hawaiian music.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.509
Oh, my God.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.978
So do we start using that
and start grilling away?

09:06.011 --> 09:07.546
It's for looks.
Thank you.

09:11.517 --> 09:12.952
Mm.

09:12.985 --> 09:14.453
Oh,.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.122
What the.

09:16.155 --> 09:17.923
No, it's stuck.

09:17.957 --> 09:20.192
Are you trying to get
the smoke detectors to come on?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.361
No, I'm trying to get
the thing off the top.

09:28.801 --> 09:29.802
'Scuse me.

09:29.835 --> 09:30.000
Having a world-known chef

09:30.000 --> 09:31.470
Having a world-known chef

09:31.504 --> 09:33.105
spit out my food

09:33.139 --> 09:34.306
is not good.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.976
- Tiki platter.
- Platter.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.545
We need Bill ready
to carve a filet.

09:39.578 --> 09:41.914
Tell my father
to put his black chef coat on.

09:44.049 --> 09:45.851
Cheryl wants you to put
your black chef coat on.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.686
Next, filet mignon.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.823
So I'm sort of looking forward
to a really nice, classic,

09:50.856 --> 09:51.857
piece of meat.

09:51.891 --> 09:53.292
Show you where it is.

09:53.325 --> 09:54.860
Strip down, baby.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.962
I'm not looking.
Don't get excited.

09:58.564 --> 10:00.000
We having flaming filet mignon
that I serve tableside.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.168
We having flaming filet mignon
that I serve tableside.

10:02.201 --> 10:04.637
People justlove.

10:04.670 --> 10:08.140
The chef's dream,
filet mignon.

10:08.174 --> 10:11.010
Mm. Something simple.

10:11.043 --> 10:12.878
Something classic.

10:12.912 --> 10:16.215
And something
that's not normally served

10:16.248 --> 10:17.650
on a trolley.

10:21.654 --> 10:22.888
What is that thing?

10:22.922 --> 10:25.524
Use a roof tile.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.092
We're eating it
from the tile.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.828
Yeah.
I'm gonna finish it.

10:28.861 --> 10:30.000
It's still cooking.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.663
It's still cooking.

10:30.696 --> 10:33.132
You'll love this.
You'll love this.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.268
What's that in there?

10:36.302 --> 10:37.803
This is butter
and garlic.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.306
Oh, garlic butter.
Mm-hmm.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.976
It goes on top.

10:44.009 --> 10:46.645
And so the tsunami
is the garlic butter

10:46.679 --> 10:47.980
running down
the drainpipe.

10:48.013 --> 10:49.782
Right.
Watch out,
there's a little bit

10:49.815 --> 10:51.217
of stuff
dripping out the end.

10:53.619 --> 10:55.688
Wow.
You enjoy that.

10:55.721 --> 10:59.024
Thank you very much.
Quite welcome.

11:01.994 --> 11:05.464
Wow.  me.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.169
Mm.

11:11.503 --> 11:13.572
That's the toughest

11:13.606 --> 11:17.042
and the most chewiest
filet mignon

11:17.076 --> 11:19.545
I've ever tasted
in my entire life.

11:22.581 --> 11:24.450
Is it chewy?

11:24.483 --> 11:25.718
Do you want me to--

11:25.751 --> 11:27.253
uh, yeah, no,
I--I--I've finished here.

11:27.286 --> 11:29.054
Take this out of your way?
Yeah. Thank you
very much.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.491
Chef Ramsay hated the food.

11:32.524 --> 11:33.959
He hated the decor.

11:33.993 --> 11:37.363
And I can't understand why.

11:39.164 --> 11:41.000
Less than impressed
with lunch...

11:41.033 --> 11:42.534
Bryan.
Bryan.
Good to meet you.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.337
Chef Ramsay is anxious
to discuss

11:44.370 --> 11:47.340
Flamango's eclectic cuisine
with the head chef.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.875
How long
have you been here?

11:48.908 --> 11:50.142
Um, about a month.

11:50.142 --> 11:52.144
What's it like
cooking that food?

11:52.177 --> 11:53.879
Does it blow you away?
Are you excited?

11:53.912 --> 11:55.080
No, it doesn't
blow me away.

11:55.113 --> 11:56.348
I think it's all over
the place.

11:56.381 --> 11:57.950
Straight up,
would you eat it?

11:57.983 --> 11:59.084
No.
No.

11:59.117 --> 12:00.000
But you have to serve it
to me.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.920
But you have to serve it
to me.

12:01.954 --> 12:03.589
When a new chef starts
in a restaurant,

12:03.622 --> 12:06.158
he wants to put his imprint
on the menu.
right.

12:06.191 --> 12:07.392
But they don't
want change right now.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.828
Who doesn't
want change?
The owners.

12:08.861 --> 12:10.329
Right.
Who writes the menus?

12:10.362 --> 12:11.430
We do.

12:11.463 --> 12:14.433
Why wouldn't you listen
to your chef?

12:14.466 --> 12:16.335
I don't know.

12:17.169 --> 12:18.604
It's frustrating
for me too

12:18.638 --> 12:20.973
because, like I said,
I've made the suggestions.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.475
You sent it to me.

12:22.508 --> 12:26.879
You sent every  dish
to me and it was embarrassing.

12:26.913 --> 12:30.000
- That's not cooking.
- That's dog.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.384
- That's not cooking.
- That's dog.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.885
We take pride
in what we serve.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.787
And he just ripped it apart.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.023
It's awful.

12:37.056 --> 12:38.257
Coming up...

12:38.291 --> 12:39.759
You can make this work
if you believe in it.

12:39.792 --> 12:40.927
Ugh.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.295
It's a test of wills.

12:42.328 --> 12:44.764
How can you be positive
about something you hate?

12:44.797 --> 12:46.232
Blech.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.433
I need to know
that you're committed.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.068
Okay, so stop bugging me!

12:49.102 --> 12:51.037
It's the battle of the owner...

12:51.070 --> 12:53.239
You don't frickin' listen!

12:53.272 --> 12:54.807
And the world-class chef.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.376
If you're not gonna
embrace change,

12:56.409 --> 12:57.543
shut the shop.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.711
Who will stay...

12:58.745 --> 13:00.000
How stupid can you be?

13:00.000 --> 13:00.046
How stupid can you be?

13:00.079 --> 13:01.914
It's an absolute nightmare.
A real nightmare.

13:01.948 --> 13:02.982
And who will go?

13:03.016 --> 13:04.183
I need to get out of here.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.685
I would rather close
the doors.

13:05.718 --> 13:08.554
And later, a shocking event

13:08.554 --> 13:11.657
That will bring Gordon
and Adele together.

13:11.690 --> 13:14.126
Sometimes it's hard
to say good-bye to the past.

13:14.159 --> 13:16.829
But it might be the end
of Flamangos.

13:16.862 --> 13:19.598
Oh, my God!

13:28.774 --> 13:31.611
Chef Ramsay's already aware
that the food is horrible

13:31.644 --> 13:33.746
And the chef is really
an unhappy cook.

13:33.779 --> 13:35.548
But before Gordon
can even contemplate

13:35.581 --> 13:38.451
making changes, he needs
to get the complete story

13:38.484 --> 13:42.088
by observing
a dinner service.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.089
What name?
Bert.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.991
All right,
you can follow me.

13:45.024 --> 13:46.159
When the dinners
start coming in,

13:46.192 --> 13:47.593
just start throwing
some asparagus on.

13:47.627 --> 13:48.861
Put it on the side.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.229
The menu's large.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.765
The menu's a little
all over the joint.
It is.

13:52.798 --> 13:53.436
You know, really big.

13:53.436 --> 13:53.933
You know, really big.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.101
I don't have time
to read all this.

13:55.134 --> 13:56.302
It's got a lot of things
on it.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.904
Tonight's dinner service

13:57.937 --> 14:00.606
Is busier than usual
because Chef Ramsay is in town.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.275
You ready to order?

14:02.308 --> 14:04.443
And as customers order
from this massive menu...

14:06.979 --> 14:08.014
Okay.

14:08.047 --> 14:09.382
Tickets are flying
into the kitchen.

14:09.415 --> 14:11.017
Here we go.
Calamari marinara.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.351
But the challenge

14:12.385 --> 14:13.853
to perfect such a huge variety
of dishes

14:13.886 --> 14:16.222
is overwhelming
for Chef Bryan.

14:16.255 --> 14:17.557
I-I don't even know
what to do.

14:17.590 --> 14:18.858
It's absolute crazy.
You know what.

14:18.891 --> 14:19.992
Yeah.
Huh?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.394
Yeah. We got
way too many tickets

14:21.427 --> 14:22.528
up here.

14:22.562 --> 14:23.436
Can't have 400 things
on your menu.

14:23.436 --> 14:23.796
Can't have 400 things
on your menu.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.031
You just can't do it.

14:25.064 --> 14:27.466
I don't care who you are.
Doesn't matter.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.669
We're absolutely buried
over here. Buried.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.270
We don't even have these
set up yet.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.573
Unbelievable.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.775
Although Chef Bryan is slammed
in the kitchen...

14:35.808 --> 14:37.543
It's like a circus
over here.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.913
The customers are not exactly
sympathetic.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.924
Well, I can't do it.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.436
They're all waiting
the same amount.

14:53.436 --> 14:54.093
They're all waiting
the same amount.

14:54.126 --> 14:55.695
Like, we know!

14:55.728 --> 14:58.097
Shut your mouth already!

14:58.130 --> 14:59.699
Absolute crazy.

14:59.732 --> 15:03.069
Adele's attitude
is completely toxic

15:03.102 --> 15:06.806
and it trickles down
from us to the patrons.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.408
It's 45 minutes
into dinner service

15:09.442 --> 15:12.111
And Bryan has finally completed
the first orders.

15:12.144 --> 15:14.580
I need this food out
of the window right now.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.349
However, just as fast as dishes

15:16.382 --> 15:18.884
Are rushed
to the dinning room...

15:21.020 --> 15:23.389
They are quickly returned
to the kitchen.

15:23.422 --> 15:23.436
Hey, guys, the shrimps
are just way too small.

15:23.436 --> 15:26.125
Hey, guys, the shrimps
are just way too small.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.327
And she said the red rice
in the risotto is just bland.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.096
Just.
Oh, my God.

15:30.129 --> 15:31.631
I've had it today already.
I've had it.

15:31.664 --> 15:32.732
Why am I here?
That's it.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.834
- I'm taking a break.
- This.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.235
Bryan, two seconds.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.504
Bottom line, I mean,
it was just about overwhelming.

15:38.537 --> 15:40.273
Disaster.
Disaster.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.874
Major.

15:41.907 --> 15:44.543
It's the menu I was thrown into
and it's a disastrous menu.

15:44.577 --> 15:45.678
How can you get
passionate

15:45.711 --> 15:47.079
about cooking something
you hate?

15:47.113 --> 15:48.180
It's all over the place.

15:48.214 --> 15:49.348
It's uncookable.
Right.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.983
I need to know
that you're committed.

15:51.017 --> 15:53.185
Committed to change.
Yes.

15:53.219 --> 15:53.436
'cause they have no clue.

15:53.436 --> 15:54.353
'cause they have no clue.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.656
This restaurant turnaround
cannot depend on them.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.991
It depends on you
sticking with me.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.159
Is that clear?
Absolutely.

16:00.192 --> 16:01.994
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah.

16:02.028 --> 16:04.363
Now that Chef Ramsay understands
Bryan's issues,

16:04.397 --> 16:05.498
They head back
to the kitchen.

16:05.531 --> 16:07.466
Here I go.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.037
Meanwhile, Bill is ready
to serve the tableside tsunami.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.538
I get tired real quick.

16:12.571 --> 16:14.607
But to help the business,

16:14.640 --> 16:16.008
I'll do whatever I have
to do.

16:17.009 --> 16:19.712
No, it's medium rare.

16:19.745 --> 16:20.980
If you just cut that
a little bit,

16:21.013 --> 16:22.648
you'll see
it's medium rare.

16:22.682 --> 16:23.436
What you have to do
is cut it.

16:23.436 --> 16:24.016
What you have to do
is cut it.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.519
No, but I mean,

16:26.552 --> 16:27.653
cut it this way

16:27.687 --> 16:29.388
'cause it was sitting
on a hot tile.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.157
It's not medium rare.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.492
Okay, I'm sorry.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.394
Oh, jeez.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.529
I got a 70-year-old man

16:36.562 --> 16:37.530
going 'round
and 'round

16:37.563 --> 16:38.798
the dinning room.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.466
He shouldn't be doing this
at this pace.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.734
I know,
well, they're too cheap--

16:41.767 --> 16:43.502
'cause they're too cheap
to hire anybody else.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.671
What are they trying to do,
put the father in the grave?

16:45.705 --> 16:47.406
I mean, he's got one foot
in there already.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.941
He didn't even want
to do this.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.276
He didn't want--
he wanted to retire.

16:50.309 --> 16:52.445
He told me that.
That's what hurts.
Yeah.

16:52.478 --> 16:53.436
Bill is overworked.
And it's not fair.

16:53.436 --> 16:56.515
Bill is overworked.
And it's not fair.

16:57.983 --> 16:59.719
After a night where he witnessed

16:59.752 --> 17:02.421
A dejected chef,
unhappy patrons,

17:02.455 --> 17:04.190
and an overworked
older owner,

17:04.223 --> 17:06.592
Gordon knows he has to have
a serious talk

17:06.625 --> 17:09.562
with the tough mother-daughter
team of Adele and Cheryl.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.030
I wanted to talk
to you both personally

17:11.063 --> 17:13.165
and express my concerns
about Bill.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.101
I'm seriously worried
about him

17:15.134 --> 17:17.169
in a big way.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.538
Running around
at the age of 70

17:19.572 --> 17:20.806
pushing the cart.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.608
Why are you guys letting him
do this?

17:22.641 --> 17:23.436
He really doesn't work

17:23.436 --> 17:24.176
He really doesn't work

17:24.210 --> 17:25.745
That much.

17:28.514 --> 17:32.017
You know what,
it's always "Poor Bill."

17:32.051 --> 17:35.221
That's Bill's nickname.
"Poor Bill."

17:35.254 --> 17:37.323
Why have you asked me
to come here?

17:37.356 --> 17:40.493
'Cause I feel like I'm wasting
my time.

17:40.526 --> 17:43.229
Because we don't know
what the problem is.

17:43.262 --> 17:44.964
And the service downstairs
tonight, how was that?

17:44.997 --> 17:46.532
The kitchen...
The kitchen was...

17:46.565 --> 17:47.700
Was a disaster.
Yeah.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.135
So you employed the chef.

17:49.168 --> 17:50.770
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.471
And he hasn't been given chance
to cook.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.436
He's cooking your menu.

17:53.436 --> 17:54.673
He's cooking your menu.

17:54.707 --> 17:58.077
Right, we never changed
the menu since we opened.

17:58.110 --> 18:01.414
He never gets a chance
to show you what he can cook.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.749
Because we felt that our food
was very good.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.585
. Are you stupid?

18:09.021 --> 18:11.957
I guess I am.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.160
You're accepting
that it's perfect

18:14.193 --> 18:16.629
and I'm trying to tell you
bluntly that it's not.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.898
Yet you never seem to accept
your own mistakes.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.666
It's never your doing.

18:20.699 --> 18:23.402
We thought our food was good,
but now you just, you know,

18:23.436 --> 18:23.436
said it's horrible.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.670
said it's horrible.

18:24.703 --> 18:29.208
You cannot see a problem
in your own establishment?

18:29.241 --> 18:31.710
No.

18:31.744 --> 18:32.978
I'm being honest.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.814
What I would like to see

18:34.847 --> 18:36.982
is just a little bit
more integrity

18:37.016 --> 18:40.085
with owning up
to the responsibility

18:40.119 --> 18:41.620
to why this place
is not working.

18:41.654 --> 18:45.658
There's no acceptance
of your own mistakes.

18:45.691 --> 18:49.428
Good night.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.441
Chef Ramsay realizes

19:02.475 --> 19:04.543
That the only way to begin
to fix some of these problems

19:04.577 --> 19:07.179
is to do something
these owners have never done.

19:07.213 --> 19:08.547
Have a staff meeting.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.282
It's so important

19:10.316 --> 19:11.217
to clear the air.

19:11.250 --> 19:12.485
If anyone has anything
to say,

19:12.518 --> 19:14.753
please talk about it.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.192
I'll listen to anything.

19:20.226 --> 19:22.561
Doesn't mean I'm gonna agree
to it.

19:22.595 --> 19:23.436
The menu needs
to be simplified.

19:23.436 --> 19:24.096
The menu needs
to be simplified.

19:24.129 --> 19:26.298
Are you kidding?
Cut it way back.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.869
People want to come in here
in cutoff shorts

19:29.902 --> 19:31.537
and have a beer and a burger.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.439
Yeah, but you just started.

19:33.472 --> 19:36.275
I don't even know
how you cook...

19:36.308 --> 19:38.310
Thoroughly yet.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.846
You've got to have
the confidence

19:40.880 --> 19:42.014
and allow this man

19:42.047 --> 19:43.449
to step up to the mark.

19:43.482 --> 19:45.851
You need to be a little bit
more entrusting on that

19:45.885 --> 19:48.354
and less nervous
about letting go.

19:48.387 --> 19:52.024
I can't do my job
if they don't let me do my job.

19:52.057 --> 19:53.436
Okay, next question.

19:53.436 --> 19:54.126
Okay, next question.

19:54.159 --> 19:55.794
I can't understand

19:55.828 --> 19:57.429
Why the
you don't like me.

19:57.463 --> 20:00.633
Well, Isabelle,

20:00.666 --> 20:02.735
you're an excellent server,

20:02.768 --> 20:04.570
but you don't frickin' listen!

20:04.603 --> 20:05.905
But I know what I'm doing.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.172
I don't need
to be constantly told

20:07.206 --> 20:09.542
the same thing over
and over again.

20:09.575 --> 20:10.976
Isabelle, please be quiet.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.711
Why would you think
you have to tell me

20:12.745 --> 20:14.880
when I've been here
for two years?

20:14.914 --> 20:18.317
I know what the
I'm doing.

20:18.350 --> 20:21.453
Isabelle, you don't know
when to shut up.

20:21.487 --> 20:23.355
They don't want
to hear opinions.

20:23.389 --> 20:23.436
We're still going to get treated
like garbage.

20:23.436 --> 20:25.157
We're still going to get treated
like garbage.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.326
I don't think they're going
to change.

20:30.229 --> 20:34.900
Coming up, a fire storm
no one saw coming.

20:34.934 --> 20:38.504
Oh, my God.

20:38.537 --> 20:41.540
Will it destroy Flamangos
and tear this family apart?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.375
Horrible.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.778
That's coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

20:45.811 --> 20:48.314
No!

20:53.919 --> 20:56.555
Centrally located
next to the train station,

20:56.588 --> 20:59.191
Flamangos has managed to push
away its local customers.

20:59.224 --> 21:02.627
Today, Chef Ramsay begins
his plan to bring them back.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.596
We're going to start
making some changes.

21:04.629 --> 21:06.331
Yeah?

21:06.364 --> 21:09.267
I am afraid
to make the change.

21:09.301 --> 21:11.103
Change number one,

21:11.136 --> 21:13.472
let this man cook something

21:13.505 --> 21:15.507
that he wants to put on
as a special tonight

21:15.540 --> 21:18.577
without any interruptions
from you two.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.449
Second change, Bill,

21:20.449 --> 21:20.512
Second change, Bill,

21:20.545 --> 21:21.847
what is your favorite dish
to cook?

21:21.880 --> 21:23.014
My meat loaf.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.382
When was the last time
you cooked it?

21:24.416 --> 21:25.517
Eight years ago.

21:25.550 --> 21:27.085
Tonight, you're going to cook
that as well.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.087
Really!
Yes, I don't want you
'round there

21:29.121 --> 21:31.022
pushing the trolley out,

21:31.056 --> 21:33.692
running around
like a blue housefly.

21:33.725 --> 21:37.095
Both items will go on tonight
as specials.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.030
My meat loaf that I've been
making for years,

21:39.064 --> 21:41.500
that I haven't made
in a long time,

21:41.533 --> 21:45.337
it's going to be great
to have it on the menu tonight.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.105
Your meatloaf,

21:47.139 --> 21:48.707
What are you
seasoning it with?

21:48.740 --> 21:50.375
Fresh parsley and a little
salt and pepper.

21:50.408 --> 21:50.449
I enjoy cooking a lot better
than pushing the trolley around.

21:50.449 --> 21:55.147
I enjoy cooking a lot better
than pushing the trolley around.

21:55.180 --> 21:56.181
Bryan,
what are you doing?

21:56.214 --> 21:57.249
Chicken and shrimp
jubilee.

21:57.282 --> 21:59.518
Rosemary. Gorgonzola.
Brown sauce.

21:59.551 --> 22:00.986
Chef Ramsay definitely
let me have free rein

22:01.019 --> 22:02.387
on creating my own special.

22:02.420 --> 22:03.855
And I wanted to prove
to Bill and Adele

22:03.889 --> 22:04.890
that I can do it.

22:04.923 --> 22:05.857
I can handle the job.

22:05.891 --> 22:07.926
Right. Very nice.
Dig in.

22:09.794 --> 22:10.795
That is so good.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.298
Thumbs up? Yes?

22:13.331 --> 22:14.966
- Everybody happy?
- Yes.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.970
I liked it, but I would never
order meat loaf out--never.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.449
I can't believe that Chef Ramsay
wants meat loaf.

22:20.449 --> 22:23.675
I can't believe that Chef Ramsay
wants meat loaf.

22:23.708 --> 22:25.677
Tonight, we kind of have
a disaster.

22:25.710 --> 22:27.579
So let's get set up.
Let's get prepped.

22:27.612 --> 22:29.614
We're opening up.
Let's go guys, yes?

22:34.886 --> 22:36.688
As Chef Bryan and his team

22:36.721 --> 22:38.523
Prepare specials
for tonight's dinner service,

22:38.557 --> 22:41.193
no detail goes unnoticed
by Chef Ramsay

22:41.226 --> 22:42.527
out in the dinning room.

22:42.561 --> 22:44.696
What--those nails.
What's going on there?

22:44.729 --> 22:46.531
What happened?
Aren't they pretty?

22:46.565 --> 22:48.366
Pretty?
They're  disgusting.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.449
Chef Ramsay asked her
about her  damn nails.

22:50.449 --> 22:52.204
Chef Ramsay asked her
about her  damn nails.

22:52.237 --> 22:55.006
Cheryl is the '80s.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.775
Are you high maintenance
or what?

22:56.808 --> 22:59.177
Huh? Serious.
But I work hard.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.613
Yeah. Unfortunately,
the wrong places.

23:01.646 --> 23:03.248
Hello.
Hi.

23:03.281 --> 23:04.549
Follow me.

23:04.583 --> 23:07.085
All of our specials tonight
are excellent.

23:10.622 --> 23:11.957
Excellent choice.

23:11.990 --> 23:15.360
I think there's hope
adding the specials.

23:15.393 --> 23:17.963
But will people like it?
I don't really know.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.467
Bryan, I want to see you
step up to the mark tonight.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.070
Okay? So get on top of it
from the out.
Yes, sir.

23:25.103 --> 23:28.673
Ordering three jubilee,
meat loaf, chicken special.

23:28.707 --> 23:29.608
Come on.

23:29.641 --> 23:30.842
Really big night tonight.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.544
More importantly,
these specials have to work.

23:32.577 --> 23:33.845
But Bryan has to command
the kitchen

23:33.878 --> 23:34.980
and run it like a head chef.

23:35.013 --> 23:36.781
Because, unfortunately,
the owners employed him

23:36.815 --> 23:37.749
as a line cook.

23:37.782 --> 23:39.251
Tonight has to be his night.

23:39.284 --> 23:40.785
Three jubilees
picking up.

23:40.819 --> 23:41.987
One meat loaf.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.021
Many of the diners

23:43.054 --> 23:44.022
Have ordered
the specials...

23:44.055 --> 23:45.490
Chicken special.
And that has had

23:45.523 --> 23:47.225
a positive impact
on the kitchen.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.461
You're doing okay.
You're doing beautifully.

23:49.494 --> 23:50.449
Bryan is not spread
too thin

23:50.449 --> 23:50.895
Bryan is not spread
too thin

23:50.929 --> 23:53.965
and is able to push out the food
much more efficiently

23:53.999 --> 23:55.066
than last night.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.668
Go with this,
please, please.

23:56.701 --> 23:57.936
And in the dinning room...

23:57.969 --> 23:59.604
How is everything?

23:59.638 --> 24:01.339
Meat loaf
and chicken jubilee specials

24:01.373 --> 24:03.141
are creating a buzz...

24:06.111 --> 24:08.880
While the original menu
is creating a slightly different

24:08.913 --> 24:09.914
kind of buzz.

24:12.984 --> 24:15.920
I'll bring the owner, okay?
To talk to you.

24:17.789 --> 24:18.990
Adele.
Yeah.

24:19.024 --> 24:20.449
Table 31,
the mahi is overdone.

24:20.449 --> 24:21.559
Table 31,
the mahi is overdone.

24:21.593 --> 24:22.761
They want to speak
with you.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.362
I'm a little busy, okay?

24:24.396 --> 24:25.864
I know you're busy.

24:25.897 --> 24:27.666
I'm letting you know
that they're waiting.

24:27.699 --> 24:28.867
Tell them I will be out
in a minute.

24:28.900 --> 24:29.934
I did.
That's what I did.

24:29.968 --> 24:33.138
Okay.
So stop bugging me!

24:33.171 --> 24:35.540
I'm pretty fed up.

24:35.573 --> 24:37.242
I'm treated like
almost stupid.

24:37.275 --> 24:40.245
Adele can be downright nasty
and insulting.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.083
Okay, complaints,
what are they?

24:45.116 --> 24:47.052
Here. Okay.
Mahi?

24:48.219 --> 24:50.355
Dry.
So you don't want it.

24:50.388 --> 24:50.449
Okay. Bastard.

24:50.449 --> 24:52.791
Okay. Bastard.

24:54.359 --> 24:56.161
I know when the customers
come in,

24:56.194 --> 24:57.929
you have to be positive,

24:57.962 --> 24:59.364
but they're liars.

25:10.709 --> 25:13.345
Mahi's killing me right here.
I'm dying with the...

25:15.980 --> 25:17.182
Which helped a lot.

25:17.215 --> 25:18.750
But I was still discouraged
with the old menu.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.318
It just got a little
backed up.

25:20.352 --> 25:20.449
Oh, we missed
the chicken penne.

25:20.449 --> 25:22.087
Oh, we missed
the chicken penne.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.521
Is that going
on the plate?

25:23.555 --> 25:25.857
Need a chicken breast
working on the grill.

25:25.890 --> 25:27.292
Biggest panic
in that kitchen now

25:27.325 --> 25:29.761
is trying to get your head
around doing this menu.

25:29.794 --> 25:31.329
There's so many components
of that menu

25:31.363 --> 25:33.198
that you're reaching for this
or reaching for that.

25:33.231 --> 25:34.866
And everything's
just so sporadic.

25:34.899 --> 25:36.134
Nothing's streamlined.

25:36.167 --> 25:37.635
And that's why
it's an absolute nightmare.

25:37.669 --> 25:39.170
I mean, a real nightmare.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.306
Bye. Thank you.

25:43.908 --> 25:44.809
Here's the good news.

25:44.843 --> 25:46.378
Chicken special,
meat loaf,

25:46.411 --> 25:48.079
were a big hit.

25:49.914 --> 25:50.449
Now the changes
may have been subtle,

25:50.449 --> 25:52.183
Now the changes
may have been subtle,

25:52.217 --> 25:53.518
but it wasn't enough.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.255
Nowhere near enough.

25:57.288 --> 25:58.923
In order for this to work,

25:58.957 --> 26:01.025
whether Adele or Cheryl
likes it,

26:01.059 --> 26:03.027
this places needs to take
a dramatic turn.

26:04.696 --> 26:07.632
In fact, the biggest turn
its ever had

26:07.665 --> 26:09.300
since this place has opened.

26:09.334 --> 26:12.470
It's time to say good-bye
to the tropics

26:12.504 --> 26:14.105
in the center of New Jersey.

26:14.139 --> 26:15.907
Oh.

26:15.940 --> 26:17.809
Everybody, stand up,

26:17.842 --> 26:19.043
grab a chair
from the dinning room,

26:19.077 --> 26:20.449
and follow me.

26:20.449 --> 26:20.578
and follow me.

26:20.612 --> 26:22.647
Let's go.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.949
I was just wondering
what's going on.

26:24.983 --> 26:27.852
Grab a chair.
Take two. Let's go.

26:27.886 --> 26:29.587
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

26:29.621 --> 26:30.722
What's gonna happen?

26:30.755 --> 26:32.724
- Oh, hold on.
- No!

26:32.757 --> 26:34.159
What do you mean "No"?

26:34.192 --> 26:35.693
That's Willy, my alligator.

26:35.727 --> 26:37.495
Trust me. I need him.

26:37.529 --> 26:39.097
In the truck.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.569
I can't believe Chef Ramsay
grabbed my alligator

26:44.602 --> 26:47.238
and just threw it
in the truck.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.174
Just threw it in there.

26:49.207 --> 26:50.449
Hey, easy with my chairs!

26:50.449 --> 26:51.476
Hey, easy with my chairs!

26:51.509 --> 26:54.312
I need the menus. Ah.

26:54.345 --> 26:55.447
Ah.

26:57.615 --> 26:59.217
I don't think it's funny.

26:59.250 --> 27:00.785
Watch if you want to keep
your job.

27:00.819 --> 27:02.153
Right.

27:02.187 --> 27:03.555
I want that alligator.

27:03.588 --> 27:05.790
They are not getting that.

27:05.824 --> 27:08.092
Cheryl and Adele
are in complete denial

27:08.126 --> 27:09.260
about this place.

27:09.294 --> 27:12.697
Nobody wants
this tacky tropical decor.

27:12.730 --> 27:14.432
They better not throw
that stuff out

27:14.466 --> 27:16.000
Or there's gonna be
a problem!

27:18.203 --> 27:19.904
Oh, my God.

27:19.938 --> 27:20.449
What is going on?

27:20.449 --> 27:21.172
What is going on?

27:21.206 --> 27:23.575
I want my alligator!

27:23.608 --> 27:24.843
Come over.

27:27.545 --> 27:29.914
I had a very good feeling

27:29.948 --> 27:34.118
That this is the beginning
of the end of Flamangos.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.721
Adele,
the only way I know

27:36.754 --> 27:39.390
when I leave
Whitehouse Station

27:39.424 --> 27:41.793
that the tropics aren't gonna
creep back in

27:41.826 --> 27:43.695
is to burn them.

27:44.963 --> 27:46.331
Gone are the menus.
Gone are the bamboo.

27:46.364 --> 27:47.565
Gone are the crocodile.

27:47.599 --> 27:48.800
Gone are the pineapples.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.449
The tropics are going.

27:50.449 --> 27:51.202
The tropics are going.

27:51.236 --> 27:54.973
My greatest fear is to lose
everything we worked for.

27:55.006 --> 27:58.309
3, 2, 1.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.487
The only way I know

28:08.520 --> 28:11.256
when I leave
Whitehouse Station

28:11.290 --> 28:13.625
that the tropics
aren't gonna creep back in

28:13.659 --> 28:15.561
is to burn them.

28:17.663 --> 28:20.732
The tropics are going.

28:20.766 --> 28:23.936
3, 2, 1.

28:23.969 --> 28:25.170
Hold on. Wait. Sorry.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.672
I forgot the most
important thing.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.240
The sign.

28:29.441 --> 28:30.876
Say good-bye to Flamangos!

28:30.909 --> 28:32.414
I can't tell you
how happy I am

28:32.414 --> 28:33.378
I can't tell you
how happy I am

28:33.412 --> 28:34.713
to see that Flamangos sign
gone.

28:34.746 --> 28:36.615
Ready? I'm gonna leave it
to the expert.

28:36.648 --> 28:37.783
Thank you so much.

28:37.816 --> 28:39.818
Please do it quickly
before they change their mind.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.458
Look at that.

28:49.595 --> 28:50.996
Anyone for cooked alligator?

28:51.029 --> 28:52.731
That was a good one.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.802
It feels great

28:56.835 --> 28:59.771
To watch Flamangos go up
in fire.

28:59.805 --> 29:02.414
Adele may be upset
that she's losing the tropic,

29:02.414 --> 29:04.676
Adele may be upset
that she's losing the tropic,

29:04.710 --> 29:05.978
but it wasn't working.

29:06.011 --> 29:07.512
It's as hot as Florida here.

29:08.714 --> 29:11.717
That is amazing.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.222
Wow!

29:17.256 --> 29:19.091
It's all right, Ma.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.596
I don't want you to be upset.
Please.

29:24.630 --> 29:27.666
She is.
You're gonna make me cry now.

29:32.304 --> 29:32.414
I am devastated right now.

29:32.414 --> 29:35.540
I am devastated right now.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.476
Change is difficult.

29:37.509 --> 29:41.046
It is.
And sometimes it's hard
to say good-bye to the past.

29:41.079 --> 29:42.447
You know that.

29:44.149 --> 29:45.417
It'll be all right,
honey.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.953
It'll be fine.
It's just the tropics.

29:47.986 --> 29:49.755
The four walls are fine.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.657
We have faith in you.

29:51.690 --> 29:52.658
The past is gone.

29:52.691 --> 29:54.826
It will be for the better.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.762
But Adele needs
to come around.

29:58.163 --> 30:00.399
Now I have regrets.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.414
I don't know what's to come.
So we'll see.

30:02.414 --> 30:03.302
I don't know what's to come.
So we'll see.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.270
It's all right, baby.

30:13.011 --> 30:15.147
After getting rid
of the tropics,

30:15.180 --> 30:16.548
Gordon now moves ahead
with his plan

30:16.581 --> 30:18.684
to transform Flamangos.

30:18.717 --> 30:19.685
Good morning!

30:19.718 --> 30:21.086
Good morning.

30:21.119 --> 30:22.087
How are we?

30:22.120 --> 30:23.755
Okay.
Nervous.

30:23.789 --> 30:25.223
I told you the change
would not be subtle.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.658
And it's important
you embrace change.

30:26.692 --> 30:28.493
That's not easy.
But it's for the best.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.462
Ready?
Ready.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.164
Good-bye, Florida.

30:32.197 --> 30:32.414
No more mangos.

30:32.414 --> 30:33.231
No more mangos.

30:33.265 --> 30:36.368
Welcome to the Junction.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.039
How appropriate is that?

30:41.073 --> 30:42.908
Yes.
Railroad tracks.

30:42.941 --> 30:44.843
Junction means trains.

30:44.876 --> 30:48.146
But Junction also means
coming together,

30:48.180 --> 30:51.183
which is what this community's
gonna do on a daily basis.

30:51.216 --> 30:52.584
They are gonna
come together

30:52.617 --> 30:53.952
at the Junction.

30:53.985 --> 30:55.287
Oh, I love it.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.155
Adele,
how does it sound?

30:57.189 --> 30:59.558
Interesting.
Interesting.

30:59.591 --> 31:00.559
Takes me awhile.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.060
Takes you awhile.
Yes.

31:02.094 --> 31:02.414
I'm not happy about the name.

31:02.414 --> 31:04.229
I'm not happy about the name.

31:04.262 --> 31:06.598
Come in.
Welcome to the Junction.

31:10.001 --> 31:12.504
Oh, my God!
Come in!

31:12.537 --> 31:15.173
Look at the size
of this place!

31:15.207 --> 31:18.877
To open up this room
was absolutely crucial.

31:18.910 --> 31:22.547
It looks twice the size.

31:22.581 --> 31:25.283
Oh, my God!

31:25.317 --> 31:27.386
The wow factor
was everything.

31:27.419 --> 31:31.123
I can't believe the wall
isgone.

31:31.156 --> 31:32.414
The tropics have gone.

31:32.414 --> 31:32.891
The tropics have gone.

31:32.924 --> 31:34.292
This restaurant
was claustrophobic.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.761
It's much more open!

31:35.794 --> 31:37.629
Sanded down and just dressed
the tables

31:37.662 --> 31:38.730
to match the chairs.

31:38.764 --> 31:40.465
The pineapples have gone.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.100
And more importantly,

31:42.134 --> 31:44.302
it's just lighted
the whole place up.

31:44.336 --> 31:46.204
Look at the raw bar!

31:46.238 --> 31:48.707
There is no longer a raw bar.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.443
This is milkshake heaven.

31:54.146 --> 31:56.915
It's perfect.
It's a lot more casual now.

31:56.948 --> 31:58.817
I'm very excited
about the Junction.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.720
Adele, what do you think?
I don't like it.

32:01.753 --> 32:02.414
You don't like it.
I hate blue.

32:02.414 --> 32:03.422
You don't like it.
I hate blue.

32:03.455 --> 32:04.689
Unbelievable.

32:04.723 --> 32:05.757
I'm dumbfounded.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.426
I don't think
I have ever heard

32:07.459 --> 32:10.128
anyone say they hate
the color blue.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.630
I hate it.

32:11.663 --> 32:14.166
You hate it.
I hate it.

32:14.199 --> 32:17.636
How can you be positive
about something you hate?

32:17.669 --> 32:20.205
Ugly.

32:20.238 --> 32:23.041
I want to throw up.
I hate it.

32:23.074 --> 32:25.510
Hate. Hate. Hate.

32:25.544 --> 32:26.945
Oh, my God.

32:35.186 --> 32:37.555
The changes to what was once
called Flamangos

32:37.589 --> 32:38.556
has been dramatic.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.492
Looks terrible.

32:40.525 --> 32:43.528
And Adele is finding it hard
to accept any of them.

32:45.063 --> 32:47.165
I loved what we had.

32:47.198 --> 32:48.500
That's all.

32:48.533 --> 32:51.636
And, uh, this is a very
drastic change.

32:51.669 --> 32:54.639
And...

32:54.672 --> 32:57.008
I really don't like it.

32:57.041 --> 32:58.743
Think about your customers.

32:58.776 --> 33:01.212
'cause this is not for you
to sit and enjoy.

33:01.246 --> 33:01.416
This is for you to run
as a business.

33:01.416 --> 33:03.314
This is for you to run
as a business.

33:03.348 --> 33:04.983
I regret it right now.

33:05.016 --> 33:07.819
But I want to see the menu,

33:07.852 --> 33:09.888
you know, and see how it's all
gonna come together.

33:09.921 --> 33:10.922
Adele.
Thank you.

33:10.955 --> 33:12.357
Now, this is trying

33:12.390 --> 33:13.825
to keep it in keeping

33:13.858 --> 33:16.227
with what's happening
in the community.

33:16.261 --> 33:17.896
It's diverse.

33:17.929 --> 33:19.230
It's sophisticated.

33:19.264 --> 33:20.398
And more important,

33:20.431 --> 33:22.634
it's modern.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.969
How's that read for you?
I mean, it--it's simple.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.704
There's a little bit
of everything for everyone.

33:26.738 --> 33:29.374
Burgers. Meat loaf.
We do a chicken.

33:29.407 --> 33:31.416
It's comfort food,
but it's fancy comfort food.

33:31.416 --> 33:32.177
It's comfort food,
but it's fancy comfort food.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.078
There's no other place
around here like this.

33:34.112 --> 33:36.014
What do you think
of the menu?

33:36.047 --> 33:37.582
I mean,
this is very limiting.

33:39.317 --> 33:40.618
Very limited menu.

33:40.652 --> 33:43.021
This menu is so limited,

33:43.054 --> 33:44.489
it's not gonna be successful.

33:44.522 --> 33:47.158
People are not gonna come in
with that small, small menu.

33:47.192 --> 33:50.595
I'm trying so hard
to help here.
Yeah.

33:50.628 --> 33:52.363
There's one thing
I need to say to you

33:52.397 --> 33:53.831
is that you cannot
be personal

33:53.865 --> 33:55.266
about nostalgia
that hasn't worked.

33:55.300 --> 33:57.268
And you have
to embrace change.

33:57.302 --> 33:59.537
Because if you're not
gonna embrace change,

33:59.571 --> 34:01.005
do yourself a favor,

34:01.039 --> 34:01.416
shut the shop and retire.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.107
shut the shop and retire.

34:04.442 --> 34:06.110
She has to get used to it

34:06.144 --> 34:07.712
because this is what's going
to bring people

34:07.745 --> 34:08.746
into this restaurant.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.415
And Adele's sitting

34:10.448 --> 34:11.883
looking like she wants
to throw herself

34:11.916 --> 34:13.351
in front of a train.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.456
After Chef Bryan spent the day

34:18.489 --> 34:20.124
Learning the Junction's
concise menu...

34:20.158 --> 34:21.159
That looks marvelous.

34:21.192 --> 34:22.594
Chef Ramsay
introduces the staff

34:22.627 --> 34:24.729
to the new dishes.

34:24.762 --> 34:27.498
Just have a look
at the portion size.

34:27.532 --> 34:28.633
It's in keeping
with the plate.

34:28.666 --> 34:29.801
This is a hallmark.

34:29.834 --> 34:30.902
Not just a burger,

34:30.935 --> 34:31.416
three different.

34:31.416 --> 34:32.170
three different.

34:32.203 --> 34:33.805
Mini buffalo, meat loaf,
and a turkey burger.

34:33.838 --> 34:35.106
The bigger portions,

34:35.139 --> 34:36.407
glazed salmon.

34:36.441 --> 34:37.775
A simple, delicious
roast chicken.

34:37.809 --> 34:38.910
Who'd like a taste?

34:38.943 --> 34:40.144
Dig in.

34:40.178 --> 34:42.847
Dig in. Dig in. Dig in.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.949
I mean, it has to be
somewhat moist.

34:44.983 --> 34:46.117
Mm.

34:46.150 --> 34:47.385
That's different.
That's good.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.653
These salmons are so juicy.

34:48.686 --> 34:50.755
I hate salmon.

34:51.789 --> 34:53.891
I love salmon.
Ugh.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.994
Tastes like a fish.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.295
Adele, how's the salmon,
darling?

34:57.328 --> 34:59.330
Ugh.

34:59.364 --> 35:00.565
Blech.

35:00.598 --> 35:01.416
The new menu is exactly
what we needed.

35:01.416 --> 35:02.567
The new menu is exactly
what we needed.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.835
It's nice and simple.

35:03.868 --> 35:06.771
But Adele has a very hard time
accepting change.

35:06.804 --> 35:09.540
This is their last chance
to pull this place out.

35:09.574 --> 35:10.541
Just go with it.

35:10.575 --> 35:11.709
Ugh.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.649
It's 30 minutes
before the doors open

35:17.682 --> 35:19.484
To this new restaurant.

35:19.517 --> 35:20.685
You got your salad bowls?

35:20.718 --> 35:22.053
Yeah. I'm ready.
Beautiful.

35:22.086 --> 35:23.321
And everyone is excited

35:23.354 --> 35:25.323
About the menu and decor.

35:25.356 --> 35:27.659
Everyone except Adele,

35:27.692 --> 35:29.661
who has hidden herself
in the kitchen

35:29.694 --> 35:30.695
on the dessert station.

35:30.728 --> 35:31.416
What are you
looking for?

35:31.416 --> 35:31.996
What are you
looking for?

35:32.030 --> 35:33.431
For apple crumble.
It's out.

35:33.464 --> 35:34.999
Joe,
can you do deserts?

35:35.033 --> 35:36.734
Yes, sir.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.536
Here, give me.
I'll take that.

35:38.569 --> 35:40.505
He's fine.

35:40.538 --> 35:41.839
He can do a desert!

35:41.873 --> 35:43.274
All right.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.842
I need your smile.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.044
I'll be right out.

35:49.914 --> 35:50.915
I'm very nervous.

35:50.948 --> 35:52.917
It shouldn't be to my liking.

35:52.950 --> 35:55.086
It's to what the customers
will want.

35:55.119 --> 35:57.088
I don't know
if they're gonna like this.

36:00.491 --> 36:01.416
I really want to go home.

36:01.416 --> 36:02.226
I really want to go home.

36:03.461 --> 36:04.696
Did you just say
you want to go home?

36:04.729 --> 36:06.331
Yes, I did.

36:06.364 --> 36:09.434
Right now, I don't feel
my mother feels she has hope.

36:09.467 --> 36:11.769
The register
has to start ringing

36:11.803 --> 36:14.272
for her to feel
more confident

36:14.305 --> 36:15.606
'cause I know
she's mortified.

36:15.640 --> 36:16.774
As the restaurant

36:16.808 --> 36:18.109
Starts to fill up
with customers,

36:18.142 --> 36:20.144
Chef Ramsay inspires
the kitchen staff

36:20.178 --> 36:21.412
for the big night.

36:21.446 --> 36:23.114
Right, bry, you ready?

36:23.147 --> 36:24.382
Yes, sir.

36:24.415 --> 36:26.250
When I get an owner
like that out there

36:26.284 --> 36:27.752
that tells me she wants
to go home,

36:27.785 --> 36:28.886
tonight, I need you

36:28.920 --> 36:30.188
get even more
in control

36:30.221 --> 36:31.416
to make this  thing
work, yeah?

36:31.416 --> 36:31.522
to make this  thing
work, yeah?

36:31.556 --> 36:32.657
Let's do it. Yeah.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.891
Feel great about the new menu.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.259
This is a new beginning.

36:35.293 --> 36:37.695
Let's take it from there.
The sky's the limit.

36:37.729 --> 36:38.730
All right, let's do this.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.967
Really. Thank you.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.970
It's open.
It's, um, inviting. Right?

36:46.003 --> 36:47.972
You should hear
what those people just said.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.507
I know. They love it.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.576
They love it
and that it's--

36:51.609 --> 36:55.780
this is more inviting
to go to than it was before.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.157
I'm gonna have
the glazed salmon.

37:06.190 --> 37:07.492
Ribs. Okay.

37:07.525 --> 37:09.394
Chicken jubilee.
Lemon chicken.

37:09.427 --> 37:10.995
With the first orders in,

37:11.028 --> 37:13.131
The pressure shifts
to Chef Bryan,

37:13.164 --> 37:15.433
who must execute the Junction's
new menu.

37:15.466 --> 37:17.702
We're gonna do a salmon
and a jubilee next

37:17.735 --> 37:19.470
So let's finish those.

37:19.504 --> 37:20.638
Put the whole pan
in the oven.

37:20.671 --> 37:22.673
Don't need a sizzler plate.
Beautiful.

37:22.707 --> 37:24.142
20's in the window.

37:24.175 --> 37:25.643
Good. Well done.

37:25.676 --> 37:27.812
Thanks to Chef Ramsay's
more focused menu,

37:27.845 --> 37:30.615
Bryan is able to get orders out
in a timely manner.

37:30.648 --> 37:31.416
Table 30 in the window!

37:31.416 --> 37:32.650
Table 30 in the window!

37:32.683 --> 37:35.019
And more importantly...
This is money.

37:35.052 --> 37:36.888
The customers are loving
the food.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.991
This is really good.
Who would've thought
you could fry a dill pickle?

37:41.592 --> 37:42.894
This is nice.
Very tasty.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.562
I like this
and it's--it's nice and bright.

37:44.595 --> 37:47.398
It's too bright.
I don't like it.

37:47.432 --> 37:48.633
Ugh.

37:48.666 --> 37:50.301
Now where's the old bag--
where's mum?

37:50.334 --> 37:52.170
What?

37:52.203 --> 37:55.506
I just don't have the patience
anymore for anything.

37:55.540 --> 37:58.509
Nice to see you.

37:58.543 --> 37:59.510
Oh. Here we are.

37:59.544 --> 38:01.245
He says
it's gonna work.

38:01.279 --> 38:01.416
How stupid can he be?

38:01.416 --> 38:04.849
How stupid can he be?

38:04.882 --> 38:07.218
Ugh.

38:07.251 --> 38:09.287
Can I have a quick word
with you--two seconds?

38:09.320 --> 38:10.822
Wait.

38:10.855 --> 38:12.490
What's the matter?
I'm very upset.

38:12.523 --> 38:15.393
I don't like this setup.
The decor.

38:15.426 --> 38:16.561
You can make this work

38:16.594 --> 38:17.562
only if you believe
in it.

38:17.595 --> 38:18.629
You don't believe in it.

38:18.629 --> 38:19.730
Your negativity's

38:19.763 --> 38:20.798
gonna rub off
on your staff,

38:20.831 --> 38:22.099
it's gonna rub off
on your daughter,

38:22.132 --> 38:23.434
and the customers
will be feeling it.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.035
I don't know.
We'll see.

38:25.068 --> 38:27.738
I need to get out of here.

38:27.771 --> 38:30.240
I have to be proud
of what I'm doing.

38:30.241 --> 38:31.416
I am not proud of this.

38:31.416 --> 38:31.542
I am not proud of this.

38:32.943 --> 38:36.914
I would never run a restaurant
like this.

38:36.947 --> 38:38.315
I want to go home.

38:39.717 --> 38:41.118
I would rather close the doors.

38:51.229 --> 38:53.164
It's opening night
at the Junction.

38:53.197 --> 38:54.666
And even though the customers
are happy...

38:54.699 --> 38:56.200
Very well seasoned.

38:56.234 --> 38:57.669
Adele is miserable

38:57.702 --> 38:58.970
And ready to leave.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.305
I want to go home.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.806
Chef Ramsay is frustrated.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.474
And he knows the only way
to get through to Adele

39:03.508 --> 39:05.743
is through her husband,
Bill.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.879
Why is Adele
so against it?

39:07.912 --> 39:08.980
Help me. Please.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.181
She's that way.

39:10.214 --> 39:12.383
But she's our first point
of contact.

39:12.417 --> 39:14.018
Yeah.
Do me a favor

39:14.052 --> 39:15.887
and just ask her to put
a smile in that face.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.121
On her face.

39:17.155 --> 39:18.393
Okay, I will do that.

39:18.393 --> 39:18.856
Okay, I will do that.

39:18.890 --> 39:21.025
Adele can't hide
her emotions.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.628
If she's mad,
you're gonna tell.

39:23.661 --> 39:27.432
And it's a struggle to get her
to go in your direction.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.067
But I'm gonna give it
what I got.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.501
How you doing?
Okay?

39:30.535 --> 39:32.503
I'm scared.
I'm so nervous.

39:32.537 --> 39:33.471
Don't be scared.

39:33.504 --> 39:35.006
Just keep smiling.

39:35.039 --> 39:39.777
Smile. Smile.

39:39.811 --> 39:40.912
There you go.

39:40.945 --> 39:43.047
My mother is a hard shell
to crack.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.550
My father is great.
He's talking to her.

39:45.583 --> 39:47.785
Trying to make her
feel better.

39:47.819 --> 39:48.393
Wonderful job.

39:48.393 --> 39:49.053
Wonderful job.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.688
It's delicious.
Yeah. Thank you.

39:50.722 --> 39:51.956
Good.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.291
Ah.

39:53.324 --> 39:54.625
Do you like
Bill's meat loaf?

39:54.659 --> 39:55.760
Yes.
Oh, yeah.
Good.

39:55.793 --> 39:57.996
I wanted to tell you
how beautiful the chairs

39:58.029 --> 39:59.030
and stuff are.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.798
You like it.
Yeah.
I do.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.967
She is lightening up.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.936
Is she lightening up?
Yes.

40:04.969 --> 40:06.204
I don't think I've got
that long.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.739
It's got to happen
before I'm 70.

40:07.772 --> 40:11.075
I told you,
she's a pain in the ass.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.844
She is.
Yeah, but you didn't tell me
on what scale

40:12.877 --> 40:15.847
of a pain in the ass she is
out of 10.
oh, she's 11. 11.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.082
Excellent.

40:18.116 --> 40:18.393
this is great.
oh, good.

40:18.393 --> 40:19.283
this is great.
oh, good.

40:19.317 --> 40:21.619
This is wonderful.
Thank you.

40:21.652 --> 40:23.888
It was a success.
People love the food.

40:23.921 --> 40:27.525
And I feel that there's hope.
Everybody's happy.

40:27.558 --> 40:28.693
It was very good.

40:28.726 --> 40:30.094
Good.
I'm glad you enjoyed.

40:30.128 --> 40:31.763
In spite of the dramatic
changes,

40:31.796 --> 40:33.464
The staff rose
to the occasion.

40:33.498 --> 40:35.133
Done. Done.

40:35.166 --> 40:36.601
And customers left happy.

40:36.634 --> 40:40.405
And now even Adele appears
to be coming around.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.540
First of all,
I want to thank everybody

40:42.573 --> 40:45.209
for all their hard work,
yeah?

40:45.243 --> 40:47.712
And a big thank you
to the queen.

40:47.745 --> 40:48.393
I'm serious.

40:48.393 --> 40:50.448
I'm serious.

40:50.481 --> 40:52.817
Why? There were
a lot of changes.

40:52.850 --> 40:56.187
Yes, it was scary.
But you pulled it off.

40:56.220 --> 40:58.823
It's very hard
to put the past behind me.

40:58.856 --> 41:02.493
I think the restaurant
could be successful.

41:02.527 --> 41:05.129
But I don't know.
Only time will tell.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.831
When I first arrived,

41:06.864 --> 41:09.267
you'd lost touch
with your customers

41:09.300 --> 41:11.936
in the community.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.105
Tonight, you reconnected
in a big way.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.007
Tonight, the Junction,

41:16.040 --> 41:18.393
even though the history
is very short--

41:18.393 --> 41:18.676
even though the history
is very short--

41:18.709 --> 41:19.844
it's only three hours old--

41:19.877 --> 41:20.945
is a success.

41:20.978 --> 41:23.681
But it's only

41:23.714 --> 41:25.483
the foundation, okay?

41:25.516 --> 41:28.252
You need to build on it
together.

41:28.286 --> 41:32.190
Chef Ramsay definitely
is giving us a second chance.

41:32.223 --> 41:35.326
And I'm just very anxious
to be successful.

41:35.359 --> 41:37.128
And I see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.796
I will be back.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.765
And I'll take
great pleasure

41:40.798 --> 41:42.700
in witnessing the success.

41:42.733 --> 41:43.835
And by the time
I get back, madam,

41:43.868 --> 41:46.104
I want you moved out
of that house.

41:46.137 --> 41:47.672
Yes?

41:47.705 --> 41:48.393
Promise me.
I promise.

41:48.393 --> 41:49.340
Promise me.
I promise.

41:49.373 --> 41:50.508
Okay. Good. Well done.

41:50.541 --> 41:52.810
Seriously well done, yes?

41:52.844 --> 41:55.313
What I've learned
from Chef Ramsay

41:55.346 --> 41:57.682
Is change is good
and I'm up for it.

41:57.715 --> 41:59.650
Thank you.
Take care.
Can't wait to see you.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.819
And maybe I'll get
some of the money back

42:01.853 --> 42:04.288
that I put into this place.

42:04.322 --> 42:05.990
Then I could retire!

42:06.023 --> 42:07.158
Right. Good night.

42:07.191 --> 42:08.459
Yes?

42:08.493 --> 42:09.927
Big kiss.

42:09.961 --> 42:11.429
God, it's so nice
to see you smiling like that.

42:11.462 --> 42:12.730
You know that.

42:12.763 --> 42:14.031
Well, I'm glad
you enjoyed New Jersey.

42:14.065 --> 42:15.233
At least this part of it.

42:15.266 --> 42:16.834
I'm thinking
of moving here.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.002
Oh, my God.

42:18.035 --> 42:18.393
God help you.

42:18.393 --> 42:19.470
God help you.

42:25.743 --> 42:27.178
What a week.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.180
We made some dramatic
changes here.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.948
We changed the menu.
We changed the decor.

42:30.982 --> 42:32.316
We even changed the name.

42:32.350 --> 42:34.385
That, honestly,
was the easy part.

42:34.418 --> 42:37.321
The hardest part
was changing Adele.

42:37.355 --> 42:38.823
She has to look forward,

42:38.856 --> 42:40.491
otherwise the history
of the Junction

42:40.525 --> 42:43.194
will be a short one.

42:43.227 --> 42:44.562
God, I'm a long way
from home.

42:44.595 --> 42:48.393
There goes my train.
Come on.

42:48.393 --> 42:48.432
There goes my train.
Come on.

42:51.602 --> 42:53.004
In the days that followed,

42:53.037 --> 42:55.606
Adele slipped back to her old
stubborn self

42:55.640 --> 42:58.075
and started to redecorate
the Junction.

42:58.109 --> 43:00.978
The new, concise menu, however,
remains in place

43:01.012 --> 43:03.648
and is a hit
in Whitehouse Station.

43:03.681 --> 43:04.715
We're doing meat loaf.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.384
I like that.

43:06.417 --> 43:09.787
That looks good.
