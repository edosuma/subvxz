00:01.210 --> 00:02.501
Gordon:<i> Previously</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

00:02.503 --> 00:05.379
Today's challenge,
we want you to create a burger

00:05.381 --> 00:06.380
worthy of the next level.

00:06.716 --> 00:09.800
<i> It's really important</i>
<i> that team trailblaisers</i>

00:09.844 --> 00:10.759
<i> wins the competition today</i>

00:11.053 --> 00:13.387
and gains safety
for all the team members.

00:13.389 --> 00:13.971
- Gordon:
Fire in the basement!
- ( bleep )

00:13.973 --> 00:15.222
this is horrible.

00:15.599 --> 00:17.433
The idea is to
cook in the basement,
not set it on fire, yes?

00:17.476 --> 00:20.269
The winning burger
of the night, the wagyu.

00:20.271 --> 00:21.979
Congratulations, team nyesha.

00:22.023 --> 00:23.397
Pyet:
<i> My heart can't take it.</i>

00:23.399 --> 00:25.983
Nyesha: Gordon and richard
have to nominate one dish

00:26.027 --> 00:27.234
to go into
the elimination tonight.

00:27.528 --> 00:31.780
Gordon: The ahi tuna burger
that is the most delicious,

00:31.824 --> 00:33.699
jonathan, congratulations.

00:33.743 --> 00:36.160
I'm sorry, devonnie.
Say goodbye to your team.

00:37.747 --> 00:39.455
<i> Tonight...</i>

00:39.457 --> 00:42.708
Today's challenge,
a next level brunch dish.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.252
Today is war.
Nobody going home.

00:45.296 --> 00:47.629
- I'll get dirty to win.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:47.673 --> 00:48.630
<i> I messed this one up.</i>

00:48.674 --> 00:50.049
<i> I'm gonna have to summon</i>

00:50.092 --> 00:51.091
every angel I know

00:51.135 --> 00:52.551
<i> to get me through this.</i>

00:52.595 --> 00:54.261
- Richard: Mariah! Mariah!
- Oh, my god!

00:54.305 --> 00:56.180
<i> That was a huge, huge mistake.</i>

00:56.223 --> 00:59.683
My heart is in my throat.
It's a wrap.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.644
<i> ( music playing )</i>

01:21.540 --> 01:27.169
welcome back.
Line up, you talented bunch.

01:27.213 --> 01:29.546
- Good morning, chefs.
- Good morning, chef.

01:29.548 --> 01:33.050
Pyet, how excited are you
about taking the top spot

01:33.094 --> 01:35.427
with that wagyu
short rib burger?

01:35.471 --> 01:38.555
Over the moon.
I was so happy to be able
to save my team.

01:38.557 --> 01:42.643
- It was the most confident
I'd seen you cook thus far.
- Thank you, chef.

01:42.686 --> 01:47.106
Mariah, you're this close
always to being the top dish

01:47.149 --> 01:49.108
and I can tell
it frustrates you.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.359
- Yes.
- But listen, here's the deal.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.486
If you've ever seen a race,
all you want to be

01:52.530 --> 01:54.822
is in that
final pack of people.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.949
- Okay.
- The good thing about
being where you're at

01:56.992 --> 01:58.283
is you don't have
a giant target on your back.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.410
Keep doing what you're doing.

02:00.412 --> 02:01.537
Tricia, this competition

02:01.539 --> 02:03.372
has been a roller coaster
ride for you.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.958
- Yes, chef.
- One minute,
you're cooking up

02:06.001 --> 02:08.544
one of the most beautiful
squad pigeon dishes,

02:08.587 --> 02:11.004
and then on the next hand
you're nearly
setting me on fire.

02:11.090 --> 02:12.589
What tricia have we got today?

02:12.633 --> 02:14.424
Not the firebender tricia, chef.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.218
Tricia on fire,
not setting fire.

02:16.262 --> 02:18.595
- Yes, chef.
- Love that.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.139
Is everybody ready to cook?

02:20.141 --> 02:23.058
- Yes, chef.
- Good.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.269
- Because today's challenge...
- Oh, god.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.230
- ...Isn't an ingredient.
- Oh.

02:28.274 --> 02:30.566
And it's not a cuisine either.

02:30.568 --> 02:35.487
Today you'll all be creating
a next level brunch dish.

02:35.531 --> 02:36.697
Ooh.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.157
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.659
It's the meal
that makes everybody happy.

02:40.703 --> 02:41.743
- Yes, chef.
- It is.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.413
Mostly because of those
bottomless mimosas, right?

02:44.456 --> 02:46.081
- Oh, man, yes.
- For sure.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.500
I have so much in common
with brunch.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.419
Brunch is sweet,
it is excessive,

02:50.462 --> 02:52.629
<i> and it is best enjoyed</i>
<i> with a stiff drink.</i>

02:52.673 --> 02:54.840
I am best enjoyed
with a stiff drink as well.

02:54.884 --> 02:58.218
Brunch has become a staple
for restaurateurs
all over the world.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.429
It's a vibe.
It's a lifestyle.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.389
You will each create
a brunch dish

03:02.433 --> 03:06.268
that has components
that are both savory and sweet.

03:06.312 --> 03:09.313
I, for one, am very excited
about this challenge

03:09.315 --> 03:11.356
because I know
you can all make magic

03:11.400 --> 03:13.609
in any one of those kitchens.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.986
All right, then,
time for team ramsay to--

03:16.030 --> 03:17.696
- gordon.
- Nyesha.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.406
Are you sure
you're ready to cook

03:19.450 --> 03:23.535
because I only see
three team members
on your team here.

03:23.579 --> 03:26.205
- Oh, boy.
- I mean, you might
have to actually

03:26.248 --> 03:28.081
put your chef jacket on
and get in there
with these guys.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.708
It's not even halftime.
You're down to three players.

03:29.752 --> 03:33.045
Nyesha:
<i> Gordon already lost two chefs.</i>

03:33.088 --> 03:35.297
I mean, personally,
I want to him to know

03:35.299 --> 03:37.257
<i> that my team</i>
<i> has some real talent,</i>

03:37.301 --> 03:39.426
<i> and we're not afraid</i>
<i> of anyone in this competition.</i>

03:39.470 --> 03:42.554
I'm looking
at my team right now,
and I'm looking at a finale.

03:42.598 --> 03:45.349
- Sounds good to me, chef.
- Quality over quantity, chef.

03:45.351 --> 03:47.768
Oh, wow. Bold.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.354
- We may be down,
but we are not out.
- No, chef.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.772
<i> Today is war.</i>

03:51.815 --> 03:54.233
We're not going home.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.776
<i> We're sending someone home.</i>

03:55.819 --> 03:57.152
We're gonna crush them.

03:57.488 --> 04:01.531
Right, team ramsay,
head over to the lift,
pick up a keycard.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.368
Time to find out what floor
you're cooking on.

04:12.086 --> 04:15.170
Tricia, tie that hair up
just in case it catches fire.

04:17.466 --> 04:18.590
I'm serious.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.928
- We're gonna win this, right?
- Yeah, absolutely.

04:22.972 --> 04:25.180
Okay, I believe in us.
Let's go.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.481
<i> I'm totally okay</i>
<i> with the middle kitchen.</i>

04:34.525 --> 04:37.359
Just cooking
in a regular kitchen,

04:37.403 --> 04:39.987
there's no
fancy-schmancy things.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.155
<i> I can do the middle kitchen.</i>

04:43.659 --> 04:44.992
Are we second or top?
I just don't know.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.576
- God.
- Yes.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.619
( cheering )

04:47.663 --> 04:48.745
- thank you!
- Thank you.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.372
Oh, my god.

04:50.416 --> 04:54.042
Here we are again,
old kitchen!

04:54.086 --> 04:56.169
<i> Seeing that</i>
<i> I'm on the top level</i>

04:56.171 --> 04:57.421
and knowing
that the challenge is brunch,

04:57.464 --> 04:59.715
I'm feeling
extremely confident today.

04:59.717 --> 05:03.969
I feel like all the stars
are aligning for me to make
my best dish so far.

05:04.013 --> 05:05.220
Wait.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.641
- No.
- I knew it!

05:09.643 --> 05:11.018
You ( bleep )!

05:11.061 --> 05:13.186
( groaning )

05:13.230 --> 05:14.438
- whoo!
- All right!

05:14.440 --> 05:16.481
I'm like, "we're here."
that's okay.

05:16.483 --> 05:21.278
This basement is, you know,
not that great.

05:21.322 --> 05:26.158
Hopefully I don't have to season
my food with my tears.

05:29.079 --> 05:33.165
- All right,
let's go, team blais.
- Chef blais!

05:33.167 --> 05:35.751
I'm already stressed.
Hello, chef.

05:35.794 --> 05:40.130
- Right, guys,
how are we feeling?
- Good, chef. Good, chef.

05:40.174 --> 05:43.258
I know we've got
the smallest team now
and it's somewhat depleted,

05:43.302 --> 05:45.886
but we are strong,
and we are gonna kick ass.

05:45.929 --> 05:49.056
Whilst my fellow judges are
now taking the piss out of me

05:49.099 --> 05:51.808
because our team's
gone down to three,
I'm actually quite relieved.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.187
Do you know why?
I can spend quality time,
and we're gonna prove it today.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.731
It's a brunch, right?
So it needs to have
that relaxed feel.

05:57.733 --> 06:01.234
So we're not going
fine dining, okay?
Grab, grab, grab.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.486
Don't come back minimalistic.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.571
I've never seen
a minimalistic brunch dish yet.

06:04.606 --> 06:07.240
It needs to be hearty
and full of flavor.

06:08.869 --> 06:12.496
Brunch is not
that uptight to me.
It's for hungover people.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.498
Yeah, so, like,
so much that you can do
with it, you know?

06:16.293 --> 06:18.251
- Hi, chef.
- Hi, team.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.253
- Hi, chef.
- Line up.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.505
We have a lot of pressure.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.257
When your peers
see your dishes today,

06:24.301 --> 06:26.343
they need to scream
top level kitchen.

06:26.387 --> 06:29.388
- I expect nothing
but the best up here.
- Yes, chef.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.140
- Yeah? We got this?
Let's go, guys.
- We got this, chef.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.392
- Right, line up at the door.
- Make you proud, chef.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.143
Line up at the door.
Make yourselves proud.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.938
Everyone, let's line up
on the rail over here.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.190
Hands on that elevator.

06:40.192 --> 06:43.360
As soon as that light
changes green, you go,
yes, team?

06:43.404 --> 06:47.614
- All: Yes, chef.
- It's coming.
Platform's here, guys. Go!

06:49.493 --> 06:53.453
- Chorizo, chorizo.
- Brunch vibes.

06:53.497 --> 06:57.040
For me, the grab
is actually the hardest part
of this entire competition.

06:57.084 --> 07:00.210
Meat, bread.
Oh, I wanted these more.

07:00.254 --> 07:03.088
<i> I'm so scared to go to</i>
<i> a grocery store after this</i>

07:03.090 --> 07:06.425
because I'm gonna be
fully bodying people
to get a hero protein.

07:06.468 --> 07:10.011
Guys, think about your protein
and build around this, yes?

07:10.013 --> 07:14.099
- All: Yes, chef.
- Seven, six, five,

07:14.101 --> 07:16.435
four, three, two.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.061
Grab what you need,
it's still here.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.479
Let's go, guys.

07:19.523 --> 07:20.480
( bleep )

07:20.524 --> 07:22.816
nyesha: You're okay.
You're okay.

07:22.818 --> 07:24.359
Gordon:
Let's start focusing, guys.

07:24.403 --> 07:27.487
Three, two, one.
Go! Here we go.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.990
- 30 seconds. Come on.
- Tricia: There's steak
over here, guys.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.533
Get your lobster, bro.

07:31.577 --> 07:33.535
The platform grab today
is all about me,

07:33.537 --> 07:35.745
which means I might have to be
a little bit selfish.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.456
- I'll take the lobs--
oh, ( bleep ).
- I'll take--

07:37.499 --> 07:39.124
oh, ( bleep ).
I don't need chicken.

07:39.168 --> 07:40.417
<i> I wanted the lobster.</i>

07:40.419 --> 07:42.127
I should've thrown
that ( bleep ) down.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.087
<i> Damn it, reuel.</i>
<i> I thought we were friends.</i>

07:44.131 --> 07:46.173
Do you see any meats--
oh, ( bleep ).

07:46.216 --> 07:50.218
Gordon:
Five, four, three, two, one.

07:50.262 --> 07:52.220
- Grab, grab, grab!
- ( bleep )

07:52.264 --> 07:54.431
- oh, god.
- Grab, grab!

07:54.475 --> 07:57.517
I'm not playing any games.
I'll getting dirty to win. 110%.

07:57.561 --> 07:58.518
- ( grunting )
- no, no, no, no, no.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.146
- ( groans )
- slow down, baby. Slow down.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.275
I'm coming around,
coming around, coming around.

08:05.319 --> 08:09.029
Gordon:
Five, four, three, two, one.

08:09.072 --> 08:12.282
- Grab, grab, grab!
Grab, grab!
- ( bleep )

08:12.326 --> 08:14.159
reuel:<i> You wanna see teeth,</i>
<i> so I'll show you teeth.</i>

08:14.161 --> 08:16.161
Today, big boy's
hitting the floor.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.331
- ( grunting )
- well done.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.291
<i> In order for me to do</i>
<i> what I have to do,</i>

08:21.335 --> 08:23.418
that onion had to be
on my station.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.253
<i> This is how I'm sending</i>
<i> somebody home today.</i>

08:25.297 --> 08:27.464
Whoo! Let's go, baby.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.383
Reuel, I love you, man,
but that's not cool.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.636
<i> I guess now</i>
<i> we're all competitors.</i>

08:32.638 --> 08:34.513
<i> We're no longer teammates.</i>

08:35.641 --> 08:37.307
Richard: Go!

08:38.769 --> 08:40.143
20 seconds left. 20 seconds.

08:40.229 --> 08:42.312
Where's my meat?
I have no meat at all.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.397
Right, I'm looking
for a protein. Hard to find.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.398
- Excuse me.
- Five, four, three...

08:45.651 --> 08:47.192
<i> Lo and behold,</i>
<i> there's the cutest little</i>

08:47.194 --> 08:49.152
filet mignon waiting for me.

08:49.196 --> 08:53.490
Two, one.
That platform's on the move.
Whatever you can grab.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.158
The filet does
not belong in the basement

08:55.160 --> 08:56.535
<i> because it's so beautiful.</i>

08:56.578 --> 08:58.370
<i> And I feel that way</i>
<i> about myself,</i>

08:58.413 --> 09:00.163
but I am here.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.999
There we go. All right.
Your time starts now.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.125
Let's go, trailblaisers.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.961
All right,
everybody have a game plan?

09:06.004 --> 09:07.128
Yes, ma'am.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.756
Let's rock, baby.
Nobody going home.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.424
We're not going home, guys.

09:11.468 --> 09:15.345
We may be on the middle floor,
but I want top level dishes.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.972
Let's go, team.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.307
I'm feeling a winner
from this level again.
Two in a row.

09:19.309 --> 09:22.811
Chef pyet,
what are you working on here?
It looks so interesting.

09:22.854 --> 09:27.357
I'm gonna keep it native again.
I'm gonna make brunch frybread.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.067
- Beautiful.
- It's gonna have strawberry
salsa, chorizo,

09:29.111 --> 09:30.485
and a little fried egg on top.

09:30.529 --> 09:32.445
So frybread is
like a biscuit dough,

09:32.489 --> 09:34.990
and then you roll it out
and then you fry it.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.157
Nyesha: Who showed you
how to make that?

09:36.201 --> 09:38.034
- My grandmother, chef.
- Oh, the best.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.828
- Yes.
- Awesome.

09:39.830 --> 09:43.039
Pyet:
<i> The best thing that I can do</i>
<i> is just honor who I am</i>

09:43.041 --> 09:44.541
<i> and what people are</i>
<i> and what they eat.</i>

09:44.585 --> 09:47.586
So I'm going to take
all of my positive energy

09:47.629 --> 09:50.171
and really throw it
into this challenge today.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.465
Sexy egg.
Come on, girl.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.510
Is there one ingredient
that you would've liked to grab?

09:55.554 --> 09:58.471
- Citrus of any kind.
Yes, I need citrus.
- Is that right?

09:58.515 --> 10:02.267
- Chef angie,
what you working on?
- An awesome bread pudding.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.477
I used some cinnamon and nutmeg,
lots of sugar,

10:04.479 --> 10:07.522
a hazelnut sauce,
a perfect egg on top,

10:07.566 --> 10:09.441
and I'm gonna do
some crispy, yummy bacon.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.151
- Nyesha: Yum.
- So it's gonna be sweet
and savory.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.820
- Beautiful. Beautiful.
- I'm gonna kill it.

10:13.864 --> 10:16.281
How is it that you're able
to stay so calm when you cook?

10:16.325 --> 10:19.159
Well, I was
a first responder in my 20s,

10:19.202 --> 10:20.952
- and I do get tunnel vision.
- Wow.

10:20.996 --> 10:23.705
Here it's just food,
but I do act like
lives are on the line.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.206
Yes, yes.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.292
This really is what I should've
been doing my whole life.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.961
<i>So I am here to prove to myself</i>

10:30.005 --> 10:31.338
<i>that I made the right decision.</i>

10:31.381 --> 10:32.589
But as far as gameplay goes,

10:32.591 --> 10:35.050
<i> nobody is raising</i>
<i> an eyebrow to me.</i>

10:35.093 --> 10:37.469
It seems like they don't realize
I haven't cooked a bad dish yet.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.971
Oop. Turn it down.
Turn it down, baby.

10:40.015 --> 10:43.266
Nyesha: We have sweet
and savory elements coming off

10:43.268 --> 10:45.185
of every single one of these
chefs' kitchens today.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.270
Team nyesha came to play!

10:48.231 --> 10:49.981
Just under 38 minutes to go.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.358
Come on, guys. We wanna this.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.193
Reuel, tell me what we got.

10:53.236 --> 10:57.197
I'm gonna do a riff
on fried spicy lobster
on a biscuit,

10:57.199 --> 10:59.032
treat it liked fried chicken.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.992
Giving it, like,
a crab boiled flavor.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.786
And where's the sweetness
coming into this?
How are you gonna elevate that?

11:02.829 --> 11:04.954
The sweetness is definitely
gonna be from that maple,

11:04.998 --> 11:06.998
so we're gonna treat it
like hot fried chicken.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.750
- Lobster is super
difficult, yeah?
- Yes, chef.

11:08.794 --> 11:11.002
Get it right
and it's a showstopper.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.046
You don't look like a guy
that cooks banquet food.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.924
Banquets get such a bad rep.
I bust my ass.

11:15.967 --> 11:20.720
This is me proving to myself
that blood, sweat, and tears,
I'm gonna earn that respect.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.389
So far you've got my respect.

11:22.432 --> 11:26.393
We're not about to get another
elimination on our squad.

11:26.395 --> 11:29.312
<i> Somebody from the other team</i>
<i> is going home.</i>

11:29.314 --> 11:31.439
Pull this one off, yeah,
and get your team to victory.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.483
- Reuel: We're here to win.
- Right, young lady.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.068
- Tricia: Yes, chef?
- Give me a g.

11:35.112 --> 11:37.195
- G?
- Give me an a.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.196
- A.
- Give me an s.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.989
- S? Gas?
- Turn the gas on.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.282
- Yes, chef.
- Come on.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.951
Tricia: I'm not
( bleep ) up today, chef.

11:42.994 --> 11:43.952
Tell me about the dish then,
because you got

11:44.246 --> 11:46.371
some great ingredients--
shrimp, asparagus, eggs.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.582
Yes, I will be making a quiche
with a shrimp and corn purée.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.836
- Stop, stop.
A quiche in 45 minutes?
- Yes, chef.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.462
It's a brunch, so it needs
to have that relaxed feel,

11:54.589 --> 11:57.674
but if you can do
a quiche in 45 minutes,
this could be a miracle.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.384
Man, this sounds exciting.

11:59.428 --> 12:02.011
Middle floor,
next level dishes, yes?

12:02.055 --> 12:02.929
- Yes, chef.
- Heard, chef.

12:02.973 --> 12:05.014
Focus, focus, focus.

12:05.016 --> 12:09.102
Guys, we don't have the bills
to pay for the freezer door
being left wide open.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.228
It's the basement!

12:10.522 --> 12:15.191
- Under 25 minutes to go.
- Ooh! Oh, my god. Okay.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.484
- All right, mariah.
- Yes?

12:16.528 --> 12:17.527
So what are we doing?

12:17.863 --> 12:21.156
Like, an open face
breakfast sandwich with sausage.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.158
I think with the chicken,
I'm just gonna use the skin.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.034
I have some cheese
and then an egg.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.328
Some luscious
sunny-side-up egg.

12:27.372 --> 12:30.165
You got a lot of flavors
that work well here.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.666
Breakfast sausage
is a clutch call

12:31.710 --> 12:33.918
because you got all the spices
that go into breakfast sausage.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.045
You added some flavor in there
to make your own patty.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.214
- Yes.
- You're so talented.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.050
- You've been the top tier
the whole tournament.
- I appreciate you.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.677
There's a lot of energy
brewing inside of me,

12:42.721 --> 12:45.388
and I think it's because
I've come so close every time

12:45.432 --> 12:48.391
<i> to having top dish,</i>
<i> but I know I can do better.</i>

12:48.393 --> 12:51.269
And so I'm focusing on creating
something that's amazing.

12:51.313 --> 12:52.353
Oh, my gosh.
This thing is huge.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.564
It's the largest
potato masher ever!

12:54.608 --> 12:56.274
- What am I gonna do with this?
- The largest one ever.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.485
I'll use the wooden spoon, chef.
I got it.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.529
What technique.
You're making beignets?
What are you--

13:01.573 --> 13:04.240
- no, sir,
- I'm making fried chicken.
I love this.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.452
Fried chicken with biscuits
and peach strawberry jam.

13:07.496 --> 13:09.162
You drop the batter
onto the pan.

13:09.206 --> 13:10.997
They're rough biscuits.
They're rough biscuits.

13:10.999 --> 13:11.998
Okay, great, all right.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.333
Jonathan's chicken is

13:13.335 --> 13:15.543
<i> a risky choice right here.</i>

13:15.587 --> 13:18.296
Chicken breast is so lean,
it dries out quickly.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.090
<i> He's really gotta</i>
<i> nail this one,</i>
<i> because let's be honest,</i>

13:21.134 --> 13:23.092
<i> he's been trending down</i>
<i> in this competition.</i>

13:23.136 --> 13:24.636
<i> He needs to prove</i>
<i> he belongs here.</i>

13:24.638 --> 13:27.096
- This challenge was built
for us down here.
- I agree.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.433
You got they got
a liquid nitrogen tank
at your local greasy spoon?

13:30.477 --> 13:33.061
No, they got cast iron pans
that barely work,

13:33.104 --> 13:35.522
and they've been making
it happen for 50 years.

13:35.565 --> 13:38.191
What a gift
to be in the basement
for a brunch challenge.

13:38.235 --> 13:41.736
How's the top floor, nyesha?
How's it going up there?

13:41.780 --> 13:44.030
Just a little bit
of sweetness.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.157
Nyesha: I wanna see
that focus and fire.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.660
None of this
is gonna be given to you.
You gotta earn it.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.036
Rocking and rolling, chef.

13:50.080 --> 13:54.165
Guys, what are all
these brunch dishes missing?

13:54.209 --> 13:56.084
- A drink?
- Hello!

13:56.127 --> 13:58.503
- Oh, dear.
- Citrus!

13:58.547 --> 13:59.504
- Oh!
- Yes, yes!

13:59.840 --> 14:02.173
When that platform hits,
grab whatever you need.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.634
- Oh, god.
- So you can grab multiple
varieties of citrus.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.178
- Zach, you got your wish, bud.
- Thank you, god.

14:07.222 --> 14:10.431
<i> This is exactly what I need</i>
<i> to make a beautiful</i>
<i> hollandaise sauce.</i>

14:10.475 --> 14:12.308
You know,
I need some citrus in there.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.228
- Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
- Five, four, three...

14:15.272 --> 14:17.438
- Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no.
- ...Two, one.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.731
Grab it, angie.
There you go, girl.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.191
Gordon:
Grab whatever you want.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.484
Anything you want.
Citrus! Let's go!

14:21.528 --> 14:22.944
- Let's get some acid in there.
- Tricia: No panic.

14:23.405 --> 14:27.156
Oh, hell no.
I hate the platform with, like,
a burning, burning passion.

14:27.200 --> 14:31.703
Gordon:
Three, two, one, and go!
Grab, grab, grab!

14:31.746 --> 14:33.329
Just do it.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.540
What is this?

14:35.917 --> 14:38.418
When the platform drops,
you gotta grab some citrus.

14:38.461 --> 14:42.005
- You can grab as much
as you want, okay?
- Oh, hell yeah.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.381
- Grab whatever you want.
- Oranges, oranges, ooh!

14:43.425 --> 14:45.383
- Look at that. Clementines.
- Move, move.

14:45.427 --> 14:47.302
- Three, two, one.
- Oh, my god.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.637
That platform is on the move.
Grab what you need.

14:49.681 --> 14:51.055
Everybody loves citrus.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.141
<i> What I do? Grab a grapefruit.</i>

14:53.184 --> 14:56.185
- Why? I don't know.
- All right, ae.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.271
- I have a fruit salad, chef.
- Okay, let's go.

14:58.273 --> 15:00.857
- I'm gonna cook steak and eggs!
- Steak and eggs. Okay.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.568
Yes. And then for the eggs,
it's gonna kind of be an omelet.

15:03.612 --> 15:06.237
You make a perfect omelet
for a chef,

15:06.281 --> 15:08.323
and you are gonna save
this team, all right?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.074
- Oh, please!
- No pressure.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.242
Especially down here
in this kitchen, like,

15:11.286 --> 15:13.828
we don't have nonstick pans
because--

15:13.872 --> 15:15.371
I know.
I'm worried about that.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.623
- Okay, so, so am I.
- For sure.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.333
Ya girl is stressed.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.501
<i> How am I gonna cook</i>
<i> these beautiful omelets,</i>

15:20.545 --> 15:22.837
make it all soft and fluffy
and not stick to the pan?

15:22.923 --> 15:26.591
Okay, listen, you got one shot,
so let's go make it happen.

15:28.053 --> 15:30.428
How's that going?
Oh, my god. Oh, lord.

15:30.472 --> 15:33.097
All right, well, it looks like
it's browning a little bit.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.433
We gotta get moving because
the eggs are gonna start
to brown on the bottom.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.978
You're wasting time over here.
We gotta go. We gotta go.

15:39.022 --> 15:42.106
Oh, man.
Ooh, it's sticking

15:42.108 --> 15:46.527
- aah! Oh, lord. Oh, no!
- Make it look beautiful.

15:49.491 --> 15:51.824
How's that going?
Oh, my god. Oh, lord.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.243
All right, well, it looks like
it's browning a little bit.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.163
We gotta get moving because
the eggs are gonna start
to brown on the bottom.

15:57.248 --> 16:00.416
You're wasting time over here.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.544
Oh, man. Ooh!

16:05.507 --> 16:06.881
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay, that's good.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.341
All right.
Yeah, you're good.
You're good.

16:08.385 --> 16:11.094
The great thing about an omelet
is you can reshape this.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.720
- Okay, chef, thank you.
- Okay?

16:12.764 --> 16:14.514
Brunch is not my forte.

16:14.557 --> 16:18.267
<i> I drink my brunch</i>
<i> 99% of the time.</i>

16:18.269 --> 16:21.229
I'll get a mimosa
and just spray a little bit
of orange juice on there.

16:21.272 --> 16:24.148
- Pshew, pshew!
- Let's go. Let's go.

16:24.150 --> 16:27.360
Listen, right now
team blais is basement.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.612
<i> Courtney's got a seven-course</i>
<i> breakfast working.</i>

16:29.656 --> 16:31.698
<i> Jonathan's making</i>
<i> homemade biscuits.</i>

16:31.741 --> 16:33.700
<i> We got steak and eggs for ae.</i>

16:33.743 --> 16:36.202
<i> And mariah, as usual,</i>
<i> has 19 ingredients.</i>

16:36.246 --> 16:40.289
- Oh, my god. Okay.
- Courtney, you're flying.
You're cruising right now.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.792
This is, like,
the big breakfast.
This is, like, a classic.

16:42.836 --> 16:47.296
I'm doing french toast, bacon,
home fries, scrambled egg.

16:47.340 --> 16:51.551
Courtney:
<i> It is extremely important</i>
<i> we rock this challenge</i>

16:51.594 --> 16:54.178
so that we can keep our four
and continue

16:54.222 --> 16:56.556
<i> to have an advantage</i>
<i> over the other teams.</i>

16:56.599 --> 16:59.267
We didn't come to play.
We came to win.

16:59.310 --> 17:02.228
A lot of work
to be done over here,
courtney and mariah.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.147
Just make sure
we got the timing
figured out, all right?

17:04.149 --> 17:05.356
We got the time.
We got the time.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.694
Okay, fam, I see you out here.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.447
Giving me ptsd, man.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.158
Kenny, how do you enjoy cooking
on this middle floor?

17:15.160 --> 17:16.951
- Anywhere you put me.
Doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter where, right?

17:16.953 --> 17:20.288
Does that come
from being a hard knife,
going kitchen to kitchen?

17:20.331 --> 17:22.623
Absolutely. Just being able
to adapt and overcome.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.418
I've been in the industry
14, 15 years now,

17:25.462 --> 17:28.254
<i> and I've been in restaurants,</i>
<i> hotels, bistros.</i>

17:28.298 --> 17:30.298
I wanted to branch out
and kind of do my own thing,

17:30.341 --> 17:32.050
so that's where
the knife for hire came in.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.885
<i> I just started</i>
<i> working on my own,</i>

17:33.928 --> 17:35.428
making my own decisions,
making my own money.

17:35.805 --> 17:38.431
- What'd you get?
- I'm gonna do steak and egg,
then do a crepe with it.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.141
You said you're gonna wrap it
in a crepe?

17:40.143 --> 17:41.559
- Yes, chef.
- Wow.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.269
I have to turn this up.

17:43.271 --> 17:44.270
<i> I went out on a limb</i>
<i> and I'm gonna do a crepe.</i>

17:44.314 --> 17:45.563
Don't overcomplicate that,
kenny.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.648
- Okay, please?
- Absolutely not. Yes, chef.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.484
<i> Attention to detail</i>
<i> at this point is everything.</i>

17:49.527 --> 17:51.319
I gotta be the top dish.

17:51.362 --> 17:53.362
Gordon:<i> Big challenge.</i>
<i> An amazing brunch dish.</i>

17:53.406 --> 17:55.656
My team's three dishes--
lobster,

17:55.700 --> 17:58.367
<i> the most amazing steak,</i>
<i> and shrimp.</i>

17:58.411 --> 18:00.536
<i> Honestly, I am done losing.</i>

18:00.580 --> 18:02.747
<i> Today we're going to</i>
<i> the next level.</i>

18:04.209 --> 18:06.292
Let's go, guys.
This is the time to push.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.669
Sense of urgency,
keep it high, yes?

18:08.713 --> 18:11.923
- All: Yes, chef.
- Zach, I know you are
a longtime line cook.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.424
- Yes, chef.
- Is this the first time
you've made brunch?

18:13.468 --> 18:15.927
I was in charge of brunch at
a couple different restaurants.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.262
- Oh, amazing.
- I rose through the ranks
of restaurants

18:18.306 --> 18:20.765
<i> starting at diners</i>
<i> cooking breakfast.</i>

18:20.850 --> 18:24.727
Worked my way up,
and I was in charge of one of
the nicest brunches in the city.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.230
It's probably the thing
I'm most confident cooking.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.023
I'm gonna be making
a nice hollandaise

18:29.025 --> 18:30.191
smoked salmon, benny,

18:30.235 --> 18:32.276
a nice little
crispy seasoned potato.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.153
I'm gonna candy some
of the orange peels
for my citrus.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.780
- Flavor bomb?
- Yes, chef.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.324
Excellent. Very comfortable
with making hollandaise?

18:38.368 --> 18:40.284
Yes, chef,
I've done it 100,000 times.

18:40.328 --> 18:43.371
- 100,000? Wow.
- It's good, but it's spicy.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.622
Gotta hope that works out.

18:44.749 --> 18:48.042
We need to be working
with speed and intensity.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.002
- All: Yes, chef.
- Bring it. Bring it.

18:50.046 --> 18:53.214
Let's fry it, let's fry it,
let's fry it...

18:53.258 --> 18:54.757
Chef amber,
what you working on?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.300
Amber:
English muffin french toast

18:56.344 --> 18:59.428
and a pork peach potato hash.

18:59.430 --> 19:03.141
Brunch is for soaking up alcohol
and bad choices,

19:03.184 --> 19:06.477
and nothing soaks up
a rough night

19:06.521 --> 19:08.479
quite like french toast
and hash.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.940
Made it very savory
to balance out the sweet peaches

19:10.984 --> 19:12.275
that are gonna
get combined with it.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.651
Where's the sweetness
coming from?

19:13.695 --> 19:16.737
Brown sugar.
Is it too sweet?

19:16.781 --> 19:20.324
You might wanna think
about not having too many
sweet elements

19:20.368 --> 19:22.285
because if you're using
those sweet peaches,

19:22.328 --> 19:24.203
there might not be
a reprieve, right?

19:24.247 --> 19:26.831
Chef arrington
seems highly unsure about
what I'm doing.

19:26.875 --> 19:30.501
- Maybe a little butter?
- Just a little, you know,
a little love.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.837
Love and butter,
that's my main ingredients.

19:32.881 --> 19:37.258
But I'm positive this is so
spicy and herbaceous and savory,

19:37.302 --> 19:39.177
it's gonna
come together beautifully.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.220
- Make sure it's not
too sweet, okay, chef?
- Yes, chef.

19:41.264 --> 19:44.432
Nyesha:<i> Look, team nyesha's</i>
<i> got bread pudding,</i>

19:44.434 --> 19:46.976
<i> french toast, frybread,</i>
<i> and eggs benny.</i>

19:46.978 --> 19:48.311
<i> Cooking up here</i>
<i> on the top level,</i>

19:48.563 --> 19:52.440
it's important
to understand your vision
and execute it, right?

19:52.483 --> 19:55.318
<i> And I know that my team</i>
<i> will do just that</i>

19:55.320 --> 19:57.028
<i> with these</i>
<i> amazing dishes today.</i>

19:57.030 --> 19:59.071
Start dialing in your dishes,
my team.

19:59.073 --> 20:01.407
That's the most beautiful
frybread I've ever seen
in my entire life.

20:01.451 --> 20:04.744
Like, come on, girl.
How are your potatoes looking?

20:04.787 --> 20:07.371
Maybe 30 seconds too long,
but they're not burnt.

20:07.415 --> 20:10.291
All right, listen,
we're cruising down to the end.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.211
- We should be thinking
about plating.
- Ooh, god.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.213
- Mariah, are you
doing all right?
- I am.

20:15.215 --> 20:18.132
Okay, you gotta get going.
I'm a little worried
that you got a lot going on.

20:18.176 --> 20:19.050
Just like the burger challenge,

20:19.219 --> 20:20.551
sandwiches are
challenging to plate.

20:20.595 --> 20:22.503
- We're running out of time.
- Are we? Okay.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.931
- Mariah, are you gonna make it?
- I believe so, sir. Yes, chef.

20:24.974 --> 20:28.100
- We're plating very soon.
I'm worried, I'm worried.
- Yes.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.561
Behind. Hot, hot, hot.
Hot behind. Behind, behind.
You're good.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.940
Tricia: Oh, there's a fire.
And again.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.275
♪ there's a slight fire,
but it's okay ♪

20:36.319 --> 20:39.237
gordon: Tricia on fire again.
Story of my life.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.489
Two minutes left!
It is go-time, team blais!

20:41.532 --> 20:43.866
Mariah:
All right, you guys, this is it.
Plating right here.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.327
Last two minutes, guys!
Start plating!

20:46.371 --> 20:48.663
- Let's go, boy. Let's go.
- Tricia, I want a winning dish.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.331
I'm gonna give it to you, chef.

20:50.375 --> 20:53.417
This is it now.
This is it!

20:53.461 --> 20:56.254
- Let's start plating!
- All: Yes, chef.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.838
Steady hand, baby.
Steady hand.

20:57.882 --> 21:01.384
This is the last
final moments of cooking.
Tie it together.

21:01.427 --> 21:05.179
- Perfect plates, no less.
- Oh, no. Okay.

21:06.349 --> 21:08.474
Come on. 30 seconds
to make that magical.

21:08.518 --> 21:11.602
- 25 seconds to go.
- Stop shaking.

21:11.637 --> 21:14.480
The platform is on the way,
team blais!

21:14.524 --> 21:17.650
- That sound is haunting me.
- Courtney: Oh, my goodness.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.403
Let's go, let's go!
Get over there!

21:20.446 --> 21:22.280
- Mariah: Wait, what?
- Go! Go!

21:22.323 --> 21:24.490
Get over there!
Five seconds, let's go!

21:24.534 --> 21:26.575
We gotta get over
to the platform. Let's go!

21:26.619 --> 21:28.536
- Move, move.
- Mariah?

21:28.538 --> 21:29.620
- Yes?
- Mariah?

21:29.664 --> 21:32.623
- Mariah! Mariah!
- Oh, my god! What?

21:32.625 --> 21:34.375
( sighs )

21:39.173 --> 21:40.464
let's go, let's go!
Get over there!

21:40.717 --> 21:43.426
- Mariah: Wait, what?
- Yeah, we gotta go.
We gotta go.

21:43.511 --> 21:46.053
Five seconds, let's go! We gotta
get over to the platform.

21:46.055 --> 21:48.014
- Move, move.
- Mariah?

21:48.057 --> 21:49.307
- Yes?
- Mariah?

21:49.350 --> 21:52.018
- Mariah, mariah!
- Oh, my god. What?

21:52.061 --> 21:55.396
( sighing )

21:57.567 --> 22:00.067
- I didn't know we were plating.
- You didn't hear him say--

22:00.111 --> 22:02.361
- no.
- Are you okay?

22:02.363 --> 22:05.156
No. No, I'm not.

22:05.199 --> 22:08.117
I totally blew that. Like...

22:08.161 --> 22:10.411
<i> Now I don't know what happens.</i>

22:10.455 --> 22:13.205
<i> Someone from my team needs</i>
<i> to have the top dish</i>

22:13.249 --> 22:15.249
or I'm gonna be up
for elimination.

22:17.295 --> 22:20.296
- Seven, six, five--
- let's go!

22:20.340 --> 22:22.298
- Kenny! Four, three--
- I'm here, chef!

22:22.342 --> 22:24.216
- I don't wanna break my egg!
- Two, go!

22:24.260 --> 22:26.218
Go, go, go, kenny!
Go, go, go!

22:26.262 --> 22:28.137
- Let's go!
- Kenny: Yes, sir.

22:28.181 --> 22:31.474
Nyesha: Dial it in.
Tight plates.

22:31.517 --> 22:34.518
Ten, nine, eight,

22:34.562 --> 22:37.480
seven, six, five, four--

22:37.523 --> 22:40.566
let's go. That platform's
not waiting for you.

22:40.568 --> 22:42.485
Come on. Get it on,
get it on, get it on.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.528
- Guys.
- It's okay. Put it on, baby.

22:44.572 --> 22:47.698
- You got it. You got it.
- Oh, my god.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.962
Okay, 45 minutes to create
a stunning brunch dish

23:02.006 --> 23:04.131
with a savory
and sweet element,

23:04.175 --> 23:07.009
and that beautiful citrus
from the mid-round drop.

23:07.011 --> 23:10.262
Shall we start
from the top please? Nyesha.

23:10.306 --> 23:14.683
Nyesha: First up,
an english muffin french toast,

23:14.727 --> 23:16.519
pork and peach hash.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.647
This is topped
with pickled blueberry
and a poached egg.

23:22.026 --> 23:24.318
Wow. Pork is delicious.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.612
Right amount of heat in there.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.531
But I'm just getting obliterated

23:28.616 --> 23:31.033
with the amount of sweetness
on this dish,

23:31.035 --> 23:33.160
this overpowering sugar.

23:36.833 --> 23:39.875
Next up,
brioche bread pudding
with blood orange.

23:39.919 --> 23:44.088
It's served with
a chocolate hazelnut sauce
and candied bacon.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.631
Visually, nyesha,
how is that for you?

23:45.675 --> 23:50.719
A bit odd to place the egg
on top of the bread pudding.

23:51.973 --> 23:54.306
Yeah, for me, it's bizarre.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.684
Richard:
All right, I'm gonna try it all
together and be brave here.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.477
Gordon: All together?

23:58.521 --> 24:00.521
Your ass is gonna be running
faster than usain bolt.

24:00.523 --> 24:02.606
I'm just so confused.

24:02.650 --> 24:05.985
Fried egg with chocolate sauce?
Man, that's a tough one.

24:06.028 --> 24:09.363
That really broke my heart
because I'm better than that.

24:09.365 --> 24:13.826
I just let myself down
and I need to do better.

24:13.870 --> 24:19.039
Next up, we have chorizo
and a frybread made from scratch

24:19.083 --> 24:22.334
with a strawberry salsa
and sliced fresh avocado.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.462
Eggs cooked beautifully. Oof.

24:24.505 --> 24:26.297
Yes, eggs are perfect.

24:26.340 --> 24:29.133
Nyesha:
So bold to create a bread
and make a bread,

24:29.135 --> 24:30.593
not just take one
off the platform.

24:31.637 --> 24:34.138
Frybread, that's delicious.

24:36.350 --> 24:38.392
That strawberry salsa,
I'm here for it.

24:38.436 --> 24:40.102
Nyesha:
<i>Pyet is really starting to rise</i>

24:40.188 --> 24:41.395
<i> to the top</i>
<i> in this competition.</i>

24:41.439 --> 24:44.273
This dish is screaming a 10
in creativity,

24:44.317 --> 24:48.319
<i> and honestly my team needs it</i>
<i> if we're going to stay out</i>
<i> of that elimination.</i>

24:48.362 --> 24:50.237
Let's taste this last one.

24:50.281 --> 24:54.191
Smoked salmon croissant benedict
with twice-cooked potatoes

24:54.193 --> 24:56.243
and a candied citrus zest.

24:56.245 --> 24:58.871
Richard:
I love that this dish didn't
go overboard on the sweetness.

24:58.873 --> 25:02.958
I love that little
candied hollandaise.
What a nice, quirky idea.

25:03.002 --> 25:06.086
What wasn't for me is that
train track of overcooked
potatoes in the middle.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.797
What a shame.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.090
Middle floor.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.968
A take on a steak and eggs
wrapped in crepe.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.887
Definitely, uh, large.

25:14.931 --> 25:18.307
I would definitely order this
to share with my brunch buddies.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.601
The new york strip is tender,
seasoned beautifully.

25:20.645 --> 25:24.271
It's like a sort of breakfast
after a night-after party.

25:24.315 --> 25:26.065
It just, it goes on
and on and on.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.274
Can you name that dish?

25:27.318 --> 25:29.443
It's a crepe, it's a burrito.

25:29.487 --> 25:30.528
A crepe-arrito.

25:30.530 --> 25:33.155
Gordon:
A crepe-rrito.

25:33.199 --> 25:36.283
This is a take on a quiche.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.285
Quiche done in 45 minutes,
virtually impossible.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.704
Nyesha: I love the citrus
coming through,

25:40.790 --> 25:43.374
but this does not
read brunch to me.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.376
It seems very compartmentalized.

25:45.419 --> 25:47.086
There's just too much
saucework going on.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.379
It's, like, a painter's pallet.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.589
This individual
shot themselves in the foot

25:50.633 --> 25:52.591
by trying to be too smart
for brunch.

25:54.136 --> 25:56.303
Next, fried lobster,

25:56.347 --> 25:59.723
chive biscuit, and the maple
for the sweetness.

25:59.767 --> 26:02.726
Took the lobster
from the drop. I was amazed
that hit the second floor.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.940
Richard:
Not an easy item to cook.

26:07.984 --> 26:11.193
- The lobster's perfect.
- Nyesha: Love the idea
of a fried lobster.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.153
That is a next level technique.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.239
I'd like to see this
on one of my restaurant menus.

26:15.283 --> 26:17.324
After tasting
my team's three dishes,

26:17.368 --> 26:19.326
<i> I've got one lobster</i>
<i> which is incredible,</i>

26:19.370 --> 26:21.537
<i> new york steak</i>
<i> wrapped in a crepe,</i>

26:21.581 --> 26:23.789
<i> and then one</i>
<i> deconstructed mess,</i>

26:23.833 --> 26:27.251
but it only takes
one stunning dish

26:27.295 --> 26:28.669
to save your entire team.

26:28.713 --> 26:31.255
Down to the basement.

26:31.299 --> 26:35.301
We'll start right here
with an all-american
breakfast platter.

26:35.303 --> 26:37.720
It's not a restaurant dish,
but that's what I love about it

26:37.763 --> 26:40.389
because it's a perfectly cooked
home brunch.

26:40.433 --> 26:42.224
A perfect balance
of the savory and sweet,

26:42.268 --> 26:44.143
exactly what brunch should be.

26:44.186 --> 26:47.062
Our next dish over here,
fried chicken breast

26:47.064 --> 26:48.314
with biscuits and gravy.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.815
This chef should
go into the business

26:49.859 --> 26:51.191
of biscuits
with butter and jam

26:51.193 --> 26:53.027
because
that's a dish on its own.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.528
That marmalade is next level.

26:54.572 --> 26:56.155
Biscuits are phenomenal.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.365
The kind of biscuit
you need to take two days

26:58.409 --> 27:00.284
to sleep it off
after eating it.

27:00.328 --> 27:03.287
The big issues I have
with this dish, it is dry.

27:03.331 --> 27:06.373
You got all me excited and
you just kicked me in the nuts.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.918
- Our next dish, again,
we're in the basement.
- Gordon: Wow.

27:09.962 --> 27:13.589
This is steak and eggs.
This chef was gifted all the way
from the top floor.

27:13.591 --> 27:16.008
Filet mignon that went
all the way down to the bottom.

27:16.010 --> 27:18.636
The sauce is hoisin
and molasses.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.554
Very beautifully cooked
classic omelet,

27:20.556 --> 27:22.765
and then a little parfait
with a spiced yogurt.

27:22.767 --> 27:24.516
Oh, my god. I'm scared.

27:24.560 --> 27:28.228
How the hell did a filet mignon
get down to the basement?

27:28.272 --> 27:31.148
Someone sneak one in?

27:31.192 --> 27:32.191
I wish my team
would've grabbed that filet.

27:32.193 --> 27:33.484
Amber:
<i> I'm thinking chef arrington's</i>

27:33.527 --> 27:36.236
gonna give us a real
talking to about our grabs

27:36.238 --> 27:38.197
after seeing
the incredible ingredients

27:38.240 --> 27:39.490
that made it
to the floors below.

27:39.575 --> 27:42.159
That steak is just
melting in your mouth.

27:42.203 --> 27:45.579
And that little kiss
of hoisin sauce, beautiful.

27:45.581 --> 27:48.624
I love that you've just gone
above and beyond a fried egg.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.959
Okay! I did that.

27:51.962 --> 27:55.130
Last up over here,
gordon, nyesha,

27:55.174 --> 27:57.758
one of my chefs
did not make the platform.

27:57.802 --> 28:01.053
( gasping )

28:01.097 --> 28:05.391
- how's that possible?
- Caught up in the presentation
of their plate, perhaps.

28:05.434 --> 28:09.186
- It just didn't make it
to the platform.
- Oh, dear. Um, okay.

28:09.230 --> 28:11.689
Mariah:
<i> That was huge, huge mistake.</i>

28:14.235 --> 28:17.027
If you don't mind,
I would love you
to try the dish.

28:17.071 --> 28:19.154
- Nyesha: Of course.
- Gordon: Yeah, love to.
Why not?

28:19.198 --> 28:21.115
Richard: This chef made
the ultimate breakfast sandwich,

28:21.158 --> 28:23.951
fried egg,
crispy chicken skin chicharrón,

28:23.953 --> 28:26.495
- a little bit of aioli
under there, melted cheese.
- Textbook.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.997
Look at that egg.
How beautiful is that cooked?

28:28.999 --> 28:30.833
Where did we get
the chicken skin from?

28:30.876 --> 28:33.377
Richard:
This chef grabbed some pork
sausage and also some chicken

28:33.421 --> 28:35.796
and used the chicken to get
this textural contrast.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.464
Gordon: Wow.

28:39.343 --> 28:41.218
- Nyesha: Mm.
- That's the money there,

28:41.220 --> 28:42.386
the crispy chicken skin
and that fried egg.

28:42.763 --> 28:46.432
I'm really sad
it didn't make the platform.
What a shame.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.350
Nyesha:
Honestly, that would've been
one of my top picks.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.686
It's too bad it's disqualified.

28:50.730 --> 28:53.439
Ugh! It hurts bad.

28:53.482 --> 28:55.482
<i> It's like pouring salt</i>
<i> on my wounds.</i>

28:55.526 --> 28:57.651
I put so much effort
and so much work into it,

28:57.695 --> 28:59.069
<i> it's killing me inside.</i>

28:59.113 --> 29:01.321
All of you, give us a moment,

29:01.323 --> 29:03.991
because we've got some
serious deliberating to do.

29:05.286 --> 29:06.785
Richard:
<i> Team blais is in rough shape.</i>

29:06.829 --> 29:09.121
I got one chef
who overcooked chicken,

29:09.165 --> 29:10.789
I got one chef who didn't
even get a plate up.

29:11.125 --> 29:15.294
<i> I'm just hoping</i>
<i> we have a fighting chance with</i>
<i> ae and courtney's dishes.</i>

29:18.466 --> 29:23.343
I'm so sorry,
but that dish that your cook
left off that platform,

29:23.387 --> 29:25.220
that's the best dish
of your bunch.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.306
- Absolutely.
- Nyesha: 100%.

29:27.308 --> 29:29.641
Let's talk about the dishes
that actually made the platform.

29:29.685 --> 29:33.604
- The fried lobster biscuit.
- Nyesha: Absolutely.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.189
Richard: It really looked like
it came from a restaurant

29:35.232 --> 29:37.399
that dominates brunch,
not just serves it.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.443
Yeah, the fried egg
on the fried flatbread

29:39.487 --> 29:42.237
with the pork underneath,
delicious.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.489
Everything seasoned beautifully.

29:43.532 --> 29:44.656
Richard:
Two really good dishes,

29:44.950 --> 29:47.951
but which one would bring you
back for a second bite?

29:47.995 --> 29:50.287
- Shall we?
- Yeah, sure.

29:50.331 --> 29:51.497
- All right.
- ( indistinct chatter )

29:51.540 --> 29:54.374
- here we go.
- Richard: All right, chefs,

29:54.460 --> 29:58.629
only one dish
was good enough to save
their entire team

29:58.672 --> 30:00.130
from the elimination round.

30:02.718 --> 30:05.219
I really want this win
for myself and for my team.

30:05.262 --> 30:08.305
<i> I don't want us to go into</i>
<i> another elimination challenge.</i>

30:10.476 --> 30:12.518
- The lobster biscuit.
- Let's go!

30:12.520 --> 30:14.269
( muted chatter )

30:14.313 --> 30:16.522
- good job, man.
- Congratulations.

30:16.565 --> 30:20.567
Reuel, you cooked
with conviction today.

30:20.611 --> 30:25.906
Beautifully done.
You've saved yourself
and our tiny team.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.157
Reuel:
<i> Today the wolf came out.</i>

30:27.201 --> 30:30.369
I'm letting them know
it's gonna be a problem.

30:30.412 --> 30:33.413
Okay, which means, sadly,
nyesha and richard,

30:33.457 --> 30:36.124
both your teams
will be facing elimination.

30:36.168 --> 30:40.671
Richard, please,
who are you sending in?

30:44.051 --> 30:47.970
Timing's
the most important thing
that we can master as chefs.

30:48.055 --> 30:51.390
We're sending the missed plate,
mariah, into the elimination.

30:51.433 --> 30:53.183
- Wow.
- You're gonna have to
prove to me

30:53.227 --> 30:56.019
and the rest of your team
that you can remain
in this competition.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.729
- Yes, chef.
- And I know you can.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.940
- You got it.
- Gordon: Nyesha?

30:59.942 --> 31:02.234
This is the toughest part
for me.

31:02.278 --> 31:05.404
- I'm scared.
- It's difficult.
Which way do I go?

31:05.406 --> 31:09.658
Do I send in angie,
who has been one of my stronger
cooks until today,

31:09.660 --> 31:11.201
<i> to knock out richard's team?</i>

31:11.245 --> 31:13.120
Or do I send in my weaker cook

31:13.163 --> 31:16.206
to prove that she belongs
in this competition?

31:17.459 --> 31:19.585
The dish
I'm putting forward today...

31:22.339 --> 31:24.464
It's...

31:29.430 --> 31:31.513
The dish
I'm putting forward today...

31:32.683 --> 31:34.099
It's me.

31:35.269 --> 31:38.145
In this intensity,
I don't think my body
has understood

31:38.188 --> 31:39.479
<i> it's not actually</i>
<i> life or death.</i>

31:39.565 --> 31:43.150
I feel like I'm at peak
adrenaline and peak stress.

31:44.028 --> 31:46.445
I'm scared.
I sure don't want

31:46.447 --> 31:49.656
to have to out-cook mariah
on a day like today.

31:49.658 --> 31:53.535
I'm gonna have to summon
every angel I know
to get me through this.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.289
The dish that will send someone

31:57.374 --> 32:01.418
into the head to head
elimination cook-off is...

32:01.462 --> 32:03.253
The english muffin french toast.

32:03.297 --> 32:06.757
I needed more
from you today, amber.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.300
Sorry, chef.

32:08.302 --> 32:11.178
I needed more
from me today also.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.517
<i> When you want something</i>
<i> this bad,</i>

32:17.561 --> 32:20.354
it's really hard to think
about it coming to a close

32:20.397 --> 32:23.231
when you're nowhere
near the finish line
you imagined for yourself.

32:23.275 --> 32:26.193
<i> I'm not ready</i>
<i> for this to be over.</i>

32:26.236 --> 32:29.488
I want you to go into
that elimination tonight

32:29.531 --> 32:34.159
and prove why you belong
in this competition.

32:34.203 --> 32:35.452
- Understood?
- Sorry, chef.
Understood, chef.

32:35.496 --> 32:38.622
- Let's go.
- We're gonna take her out.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.999
Mariah:
<i> I know that my competitors,</i>

32:41.043 --> 32:42.751
maybe they're looking forward
to me going home,

32:42.795 --> 32:45.003
because I am their competition.

32:45.005 --> 32:46.046
<i> I'm flattered</i>
<i> if they want me to go home.</i>

32:46.340 --> 32:49.257
That means that I am good
and that I am a threat.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.969
All of you, please,
say goodbye to the two ladies.

32:52.012 --> 32:56.640
- Head up into the lift.
- ( indistinct chatter )

32:56.684 --> 32:58.558
- you got it.
- Let's go.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.980
Okay, ladies, for tonight's
elimination cook-off,

33:02.982 --> 33:05.357
it's all gonna
come down to a dish
created with something

33:05.401 --> 33:10.445
that always goes with brunch
every time-- coffee.

33:10.489 --> 33:14.449
You'll need to create
on stunning coffee infused dish.

33:14.535 --> 33:17.369
This elimination, I'll be
with you during the cook.

33:17.413 --> 33:21.999
Richard and nyesha will join us
after you finish cooking.

33:22.042 --> 33:24.001
- Is that clear?
- Both: Yes, chef.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.252
Amber:
<i> I am fired up right now.</i>

33:25.295 --> 33:28.130
I am an underdog
when it comes to experience,

33:28.173 --> 33:29.756
but that doesn't mean
I'm not here to win.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.092
Right, both of you,
best of luck.

33:32.136 --> 33:33.969
Head up into the elevator.
I'll see you shortly.

33:33.971 --> 33:37.931
Throughout this competition,
amber has not seemed
to be able to step up,

33:37.975 --> 33:39.641
<i> but I know she's got</i>
<i> a lot of fight in her,</i>

33:40.060 --> 33:44.354
<i> and I really need her</i>
<i> to bring that energy into</i>
<i> this elimination cook-off.</i>

33:48.485 --> 33:51.236
It's not going to be easy
going up against amber.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.780
<i> It's her second time</i>
<i> in elimination,</i>

33:53.824 --> 33:56.366
<i> so she's a little bit more</i>
<i>familiar with intense pressure.</i>

33:56.410 --> 33:58.660
She's felt that before.
I haven't.

34:00.497 --> 34:04.750
Right, here we go.
30 minutes is not long,
so make it good.

34:04.752 --> 34:07.502
- Both: Yes, chef.
- One beautiful
coffee inspired dish.

34:07.546 --> 34:11.882
- Let's go.
- That's exactly it right here.

34:11.925 --> 34:14.051
I grab the ribeye because
it is my favorite type of beef.

34:14.094 --> 34:16.595
<i> It's fatty and rich</i>
<i> and delicious</i>

34:16.638 --> 34:19.222
and can hold up to some of
the bitter and spicy flavors

34:19.266 --> 34:21.141
<i> I'm going to ask it to uphold.</i>

34:21.185 --> 34:24.186
- ( overlapping chatter )
- oops, sorry.

34:26.023 --> 34:29.691
I grabbed the filet
because I know I can add
a lot of flavor to it.

34:29.735 --> 34:34.029
I am kind of going for,
like, a southern-inspired
type of vibe.

34:34.031 --> 34:35.072
Tell me about the dish.
Where are we going with this?

34:35.365 --> 34:38.825
- I plan on doing
a coffee rubbed filet.
- Nice.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.161
And I'm going to do
a red-eye gravy
with the coffee extract.

34:41.205 --> 34:43.330
- Love it.
- Going to do a tomato salsa.

34:43.373 --> 34:45.582
- You should not be in here
tonight, you know that?
- I know, chef.

34:45.626 --> 34:47.876
- Because that dish tasted
delicious, you know that?
- Thank you, chef.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.253
- Okay?
- This could be the last time
I cook in this competition.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.963
<i> I could possibly</i>
<i> be going home,</i>

34:52.007 --> 34:54.549
so I have a lot
riding on this dish
that I'm going to create.

34:54.593 --> 34:58.887
- Do not leave yourself
short of time, okay?
- Yes, chef.

35:00.474 --> 35:04.017
- Amber, what'd you get?
- I am doing an
aztec-inspired ribeye

35:04.061 --> 35:07.562
with an adobo sauce
and a creamy purée underneath it

35:07.564 --> 35:10.607
- of this cauliflower and some
roasted veg on the side.
- Good. I love that.

35:10.651 --> 35:12.609
I've got a lot
to prove right now,
and I'm gonna do it.

35:12.653 --> 35:14.111
I've cooked with coffee before,

35:14.154 --> 35:17.489
<i> but this is do or die</i>
<i> 30 minutes.</i>

35:17.533 --> 35:20.575
Now was the time to step it up
and be a little braver.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.119
Coffee's gotta shine, okay?

35:22.162 --> 35:24.162
So make sure it's nice
and fragrant, yes?

35:24.164 --> 35:26.373
- Yes, chef.
- Good luck. 3 1/2 minutes gone.

35:28.377 --> 35:31.044
- I hate it when people
use the peeler like that.
- I know.

35:31.046 --> 35:34.172
Amber, use your peeler
both ways. Scrub it.

35:34.216 --> 35:35.966
And get close to the stem.
Make it beautiful.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.884
You want immaculate.

35:37.919 --> 35:41.346
I want amber
to knock mariah off
of the competition.

35:41.390 --> 35:44.558
Mariah is a machine.
She is a threat to all of us.

35:44.601 --> 35:47.435
10 minutes gone,
20 minutes remaining.

35:47.437 --> 35:49.229
- Right, how's it going?
- It's good, chef.

35:49.273 --> 35:51.523
- What's that in there?
- Red-eye gravy.

35:51.567 --> 35:54.276
- Just don't get it
too gloopy, okay?
- Okay. Heard.

35:55.404 --> 35:57.779
Do you need to add any sugar
to your sauce?

35:57.781 --> 36:00.031
- It's spicy as hell.
- Pyet: Okay.

36:00.075 --> 36:03.785
This sauce is hot, y'all.
Like, real hot.

36:03.829 --> 36:08.165
So what I do know I need
is something creamy and velvety

36:08.167 --> 36:11.626
to stand against
bold spicy flavors.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.295
- Oil?
- Oil, salt, pepper.

36:13.338 --> 36:16.089
I've never made
a cauliflower purée,

36:16.133 --> 36:18.133
but in my mind,
that would be lovely here.

36:18.177 --> 36:19.593
Check.
See how tender it is.
Feel it.

36:19.636 --> 36:21.178
- Is it tender?
- No.

36:21.638 --> 36:25.724
- So it needs to keep going.
- So I'm gonna do my darnedest
to create one now.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.517
Gordon: Right, good.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.060
What's the garnish in there?
What is that?

36:29.104 --> 36:30.812
I have some coffee dusted
fried onions.

36:30.814 --> 36:33.106
- Touch them. You want
a touch more crispy, okay?
- Okay.

36:33.150 --> 36:37.527
- The judges are gonna
absolutely spit that out.
- Heard. Behind you.

36:37.571 --> 36:39.112
We're down to four minutes
remaining.

36:39.198 --> 36:41.573
- Finish strong, ladies.
- Nice.

36:41.617 --> 36:43.575
Back up. On here.

36:43.619 --> 36:47.120
Good. Beautiful.
So not quite cooked.
Back in.

36:47.164 --> 36:49.039
Try and test them when
they're in the oven still.

36:49.082 --> 36:50.290
- Yes, chef.
- There you go.

36:51.335 --> 36:52.626
Mariah, it's getting brown!

36:55.297 --> 36:57.172
Mariah has
very selective hearing.

36:57.174 --> 37:00.217
- Yeah, you can slice it.
- And plate it that way?

37:00.260 --> 37:02.052
- Mariah!
- She needs to get those things.

37:02.095 --> 37:05.222
I yell at her like,
"mariah, the onion rings!
This is gonna burn."

37:05.265 --> 37:07.641
- mariah, they're dark.
- Mariah, the onions!

37:07.643 --> 37:08.642
Yes? Okay.

37:14.399 --> 37:17.025
- Mariah, they're dark.
- Mariah, the onions!

37:17.069 --> 37:18.360
Yes? Okay.

37:21.698 --> 37:23.490
- Mariah!
- I'm going. I hear you.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.450
I hear you. I'm coming.

37:25.494 --> 37:28.453
Mariah:<i> Not getting</i>
<i> my plate on the platform</i>
<i> was a huge mistake.</i>

37:28.497 --> 37:30.956
<i> So there's very little</i>
<i> room for error.</i>

37:30.958 --> 37:32.123
Good job, mariah.

37:32.167 --> 37:35.377
If the onion rings were over,
it's a wrap.

37:35.379 --> 37:37.337
We're down
to two minutes to go!

37:37.381 --> 37:39.589
- Start plating.
- Finish strong, ladies.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.424
- Gordon: Big push now, please!
- Finish strong, ladies.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.635
Make it look beautiful.
There you go.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.345
30 seconds to go.

37:45.389 --> 37:47.222
Elimination is
on the line, guys.

37:47.224 --> 37:49.140
- Come on.
- Things are chaotic.

37:49.142 --> 37:52.227
<i> I am not feeling great about</i>
<i> how done my carrots are,</i>

37:52.271 --> 37:54.229
and I see that mariah
is also doing a steak.

37:54.273 --> 37:58.400
Now I know we're really going
apples to apples here,
and mine better be better.

37:58.443 --> 38:03.229
All: Five, four,
three, two, one.

38:03.231 --> 38:07.075
And stop! Well done.

38:07.119 --> 38:10.078
I ran out of time,
and after slicing my steak,

38:10.122 --> 38:11.371
realized I did not taste it.

38:13.083 --> 38:16.543
- I'm concerned.
- You have both have cooked
brilliantly. Well done.

38:21.300 --> 38:23.091
- Wow, nyesha.
- Chef.

38:23.135 --> 38:24.217
- And richard.
- Chef.

38:24.511 --> 38:26.761
If only you could've seen
what we've just witnessed.

38:26.763 --> 38:28.346
Two phenomenal dishes.

38:28.390 --> 38:30.932
If this goes to a tie,
I'm gonna have to break that.

38:30.934 --> 38:36.563
This is one is a filet mignon
that has a coffee centered rub

38:36.606 --> 38:39.566
done with a salsa
and fried onion rings.

38:39.568 --> 38:42.444
Here we have an aztec take
on a ribeye

38:42.487 --> 38:47.782
sat on a cauliflower purée
drizzled with a sauce
and roasted carrots.

38:47.868 --> 38:50.160
Amber:<i> I'm just really feeling</i>
<i> pretty strong about it</i>

38:50.203 --> 38:52.704
other than maybe
it's a little too simple.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.748
Right, the filet.

38:57.169 --> 38:59.461
Nyesha: Love the texture
coming from the onion rings.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.337
Cooked beautifully.

39:00.589 --> 39:02.589
I'm not getting
a lot of coffee flavor.

39:02.591 --> 39:06.051
I disagree with you, nyesha,
as far as coffee flavor.

39:06.094 --> 39:08.136
I'm getting the red-eye gravy
sort of vibe.

39:08.138 --> 39:10.472
I'm not a fan of the salsa
here at all.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.849
I have to say that's really
what's blowing my palate out.

39:12.893 --> 39:15.518
There's a beautiful brightness
and acidity from that salsa,

39:15.562 --> 39:17.520
but it's overpowering
the rest of the dish.

39:17.564 --> 39:20.106
Mariah:
<i> I am feeling frantic, anxious.</i>

39:20.192 --> 39:21.983
There's a lot on the line.

39:22.027 --> 39:25.362
Let's concentrate
on the ribeye, please.

39:25.405 --> 39:28.490
I have just got a deafening
heartbeat in my mind

39:28.533 --> 39:32.410
and I'm just thinking,
"please, please love this."

39:39.336 --> 39:41.836
texture of the purée
is stunning.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.798
The sauce is very spicy,
and it's blowing my palate out.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.966
Carrots a little bit underdone.

39:47.010 --> 39:49.177
Cauliflower's ethereal.
It's so light and fluffy.

39:49.221 --> 39:51.221
And the sauce, I'm getting,
like, chipotle vibes.

39:51.264 --> 39:53.515
A little bit too strong,
a little too smoky.

39:53.558 --> 39:56.142
It's blowing away
the coffee flavor.

39:56.144 --> 40:02.065
So, nyesha, which dish
are you sending home, please?

40:02.100 --> 40:03.983
Oh, my gosh. So difficult.

40:04.027 --> 40:05.985
<i> I just don't want</i>
<i> to send amber home.</i>

40:06.104 --> 40:08.363
<i> I don't want to lose</i>
<i> any of my team.</i>

40:08.365 --> 40:14.327
The ribeye with the cauliflower
is the dish I enjoy less.

40:16.373 --> 40:17.414
Richard:
This one is tough.

40:17.457 --> 40:19.290
Losing mariah
would be devastating.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.126
<i> She was my first pick</i>
<i> in the draft,</i>

40:21.128 --> 40:23.962
<i> and she's team blais'</i>
<i> resident badass.</i>

40:24.005 --> 40:26.047
I hope I'm gonna make
the right choice here.

40:26.049 --> 40:27.715
My least favorite dish

40:27.717 --> 40:30.218
under the circumstance
with this challenge is...

40:31.721 --> 40:34.139
It's the ribeye dish.

40:35.392 --> 40:39.269
The ribeye was cooked
and owned by amber.

40:39.312 --> 40:42.480
The one big issue with this dish
is the sauce is way too hot.

40:42.524 --> 40:45.108
The fact that
you've got one of
the most expensive cuts there,

40:45.152 --> 40:47.694
it doesn't need
such a voracious heat.

40:47.696 --> 40:51.322
But you have just put in
an extraordinary 30 minutes,

40:51.366 --> 40:53.032
and you should be
incredibly proud.

40:53.076 --> 40:55.785
I have no kitchen training,
and this was brave.

40:55.829 --> 40:56.786
My heart goes out to you, girl.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.664
You're a chef that
no doubt cooks with love,

40:59.666 --> 41:00.874
and you can't teach that.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.626
- That comes from
an authentic place.
- Thank you.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.587
Amber, this was delicious dish.
I meant what I said.

41:05.630 --> 41:08.423
And it's sad to lose you even
though you're not on my team.

41:08.467 --> 41:10.216
You've been cooking
some delicious food.

41:10.218 --> 41:13.136
Amber, I'm really sorry,
but you will not become
the next level chef.

41:13.138 --> 41:16.681
Please say goodbye to your team
and head to the elevator.

41:21.188 --> 41:22.687
Don't you feel sorry.
You deserve that.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.982
Girl, when we go back
to texas, I'm telling you,
I'm gonna hit you up.

41:26.067 --> 41:28.359
- You can buy me a drink.
- ( laughing )

41:31.656 --> 41:34.365
gordon: Take care.

41:39.873 --> 41:42.457
Amber:
<i> I started this competition</i>
<i> on a difficult note,</i>

41:42.501 --> 41:45.210
but I have fought
every step of the way,

41:45.212 --> 41:48.004
and I will always be
proud of that.

41:48.048 --> 41:51.549
Mariah, first of all,
well done.

41:51.593 --> 41:54.385
- Thank you, chef.
- Second great dish of the day.

41:54.429 --> 41:58.056
- You do deserve to go
to the next level.
- Thank you, chef.

41:58.099 --> 41:59.432
<i> I feel amazing.</i>

41:59.476 --> 42:00.350
I deserve to be here,

42:00.560 --> 42:02.936
and I deserve to win
this competition.

42:02.979 --> 42:04.521
Top ten!

42:04.564 --> 42:06.189
Top ten! Oh, my gosh.

42:06.191 --> 42:08.733
One third
of the competition has gone.

42:08.777 --> 42:11.319
The next time we see you,

42:11.321 --> 42:14.155
the dish you'll be cooking
will have a huge impact

42:14.157 --> 42:15.323
on this competition.

42:15.367 --> 42:18.952
And be prepared for surprises
along the way.

42:18.995 --> 42:21.496
- Is that clear?
- All: Yes, chef.

42:21.498 --> 42:23.122
Good night.

42:23.166 --> 42:27.210
<i> ( music playing )</i>

42:28.588 --> 42:30.630
- I did too much!
- What's new, girl?

42:30.674 --> 42:33.675
I did too much.

42:37.013 --> 42:39.013
<i> Next time</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

42:39.015 --> 42:40.765
Today things are about
to take a step up.

42:40.767 --> 42:44.352
- No team is safe today.
- Oh, god.

42:44.396 --> 42:48.731
The worst three dishes
will head into elimination.

42:48.733 --> 42:51.317
Only one of you
will come back.

42:51.361 --> 42:53.695
- ( bleep )
- this is crazy.

42:53.738 --> 42:55.280
I'm starting to panic.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.448
Each time I'm getting
used to the competition,

42:57.492 --> 43:00.076
- it levels up again.
- The stakes are high.

43:00.120 --> 43:02.370
There's only ten of us
and two of us are going home.

43:02.414 --> 43:04.289
I can't be
in the elimination tonight.

43:04.332 --> 43:07.125
- It's do or die.
- I don't want to go home.
