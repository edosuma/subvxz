WEBVTT

00:09.600 --> 00:14.090
It's identical to the other two.
Even the smallest features are exactly the same.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.440
Like they came off an assembly line.

00:16.810 --> 00:18.770
Love to see the factory that made these.

00:21.110 --> 00:22.910
Well, that's the last sensor sweep.

00:23.370 --> 00:25.510
It should give T'Pol plenty to chew on for a while.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074

00:34.650 --> 00:35.980
Power fluctuations.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.370
I think we're getting the hang of this.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.840
We're coming up on the outer edge of the cloaking barrier.

00:54.440 --> 00:55.620
They're emerging.

00:56.560 --> 00:57.620
Heading back to the ship.

00:59.570 --> 01:00.350
Visual.

01:05.390 --> 01:07.460
I want to know what
kind of armaments they're carrying.

01:09.610 --> 01:11.330
We may have found what we're looking for.

02:37.430 --> 02:40.540
This new data should help us map
the anomalies more accurately.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.500
I should also be able to calculate
the exact number of Spheres in the Expanse.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.550
- Any new theories on their purpose?
- Not yet.

02:48.390 --> 02:49.450
Bridge to Captain Archer.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.040
Archer here.

02:53.690 --> 02:57.080
We've picked up a vessel approaching at impulse.
They're transmitting a distress signal.

03:00.590 --> 03:02.680
They're trapped in a cluster of anomalies.

03:02.940 --> 03:04.090
They've taken engine damage.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.660
Let's see them.

03:09.230 --> 03:11.600
- 23 bio-signs.
- Hail them.

03:13.910 --> 03:16.770
This is Captain Jonathan Archer of the starship Enterprise.

03:17.480 --> 03:18.650
Can we assist you?

03:19.120 --> 03:22.760
Enterprise, we've suffered heavy damage.
Our engines are inoperative.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.490
Our life support system is failing.

03:24.890 --> 03:26.380
Please assist us.

03:26.990 --> 03:29.670
- What kind of weapons do they have?
- Minimal.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.150
Can you get us through the anomalies?

03:35.170 --> 03:36.730
I believe I can plot a safe course.

03:38.680 --> 03:39.730
Full impulse.

03:48.170 --> 03:49.710
Their life support system's failed.

03:50.070 --> 03:51.710
Take full security precautions.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.740
Make sure none of them are armed.

04:04.980 --> 04:09.500
- How are they?
- I'm unable to perform detailed bio-scans.

04:09.830 --> 04:13.260
- Why?
-  They have an aversion to any kind of invasive medical  care...

04:13.730 --> 04:15.690
for religious reasons.

04:16.420 --> 04:19.649
However, I have managed to ascertain
that aside from some minor injuries,

04:19.709 --> 04:23.670
and one slight case of malnutrition,
they appear to be fine.

04:24.740 --> 04:26.270
They're no strangers to anomalies.

04:26.590 --> 04:27.840
That looks like an old scar.

04:28.330 --> 04:30.540
I found similar injuries on four others.

04:30.860 --> 04:33.850
Apparently, they've been in the vicinity
of the Sphere for several months.

04:34.720 --> 04:35.970
Which one's the captain?

04:36.910 --> 04:41.370
He prefers the term Pri'Nam, a religious designation.

04:47.270 --> 04:50.370
I'm Captain Archer.
Welcome aboard.

04:51.480 --> 04:52.650
My name is D'Jamat.

04:53.530 --> 04:56.900
I can't express how grateful we are.
You saved our lives.

04:57.690 --> 04:59.710
I understand you've been
in this region for quite some time.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.710
Yes. We're on a pilgrimage to the 12th Sphere.

05:03.230 --> 05:04.900
It's taken us a year to make the journey.

05:05.540 --> 05:08.420
Your ship's in pretty rough shape.
My engineer's taking a look at it.

05:08.590 --> 05:10.450
Well, it's an old vessel, but sturdy.

05:11.330 --> 05:15.330
Unfortunately, we are better at prayer
than we are at space travel.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.940
Maybe there's some information
about the Spheres we can share.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.510
If you're feeling up to it,...

05:20.750 --> 05:23.740
I'd like you to have dinner
with me and my Science Officer tonight.

05:24.610 --> 05:26.570
I'd be honored to accept your hospitality, Captain.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.850
Our homeworld is called Triannon.

05:33.350 --> 05:36.700
It's six-point-three light years from here,
in the Muratas Star Cluster.

05:37.350 --> 05:40.430
- Have you heard of it?
- It doesn't ring a bell.

05:41.310 --> 05:42.840
We're new to the Expanse.

05:43.900 --> 05:47.860
The Expanse? You mean the Chosen Realm.

05:49.890 --> 05:51.810
I think we're talking about the same thing.

05:52.530 --> 05:56.750
We're here to learn everything we can about
a species you may have run into, the Xindi.

05:58.390 --> 05:59.750
I'm not familiar with them.

06:00.370 --> 06:04.990
We place very little emphasis on meeting other life-forms.

06:05.380 --> 06:10.460
Space travel, for us, is merely a means
to bring us closer to the Spheres.

06:11.190 --> 06:14.670
- You've studied them for some time?
- We're not here to study the Spheres.

06:14.850 --> 06:16.010
We're here to venerate them.

06:16.950 --> 06:21.840
We believe that it is through prayer and meditation
that the Makers become manifest.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.840
- The Makers?
- The creator of the Spheres.

06:25.770 --> 06:27.840
I've felt their presence here.

06:33.540 --> 06:35.240
You're referring to spatial anomalies.

06:36.260 --> 06:37.200
The Makers' breath.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.420
It reshapes reality.

06:40.120 --> 06:43.850
Allows ordinary men a glimpse of the divine.

06:44.050 --> 06:45.930
That breath nearly destroyed your ship.

06:46.610 --> 06:50.660
Well, we became careless.
It's easy to do when you're in the presence of a Sphere.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.920
They're certainly impressive.

06:55.440 --> 06:56.920
We've found three of them so far.

06:57.140 --> 06:59.920
Oh, you're fortunate to have such a fast ship.

07:00.640 --> 07:04.340
I regret that I'll die having seen only
one of the many thousands of Spheres.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.840
Actually, we've determined that
there are 59 Spheres in the Expanse.

07:09.390 --> 07:11.180
I think your estimates are a bit low.

07:11.880 --> 07:12.840
That's doubtful.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.560
With the Makers, there is no doubt.

07:16.020 --> 07:18.930
Doubt is the basis of all scientific progress.

07:19.120 --> 07:22.510
Scientific progress has led many people astray.

07:22.820 --> 07:27.300
Perhaps
this is a subject we should discuss some other time.

07:30.180 --> 07:31.180
I agree, Captain.

07:32.660 --> 07:36.340
You'll be glad to know my engineer believes
that he can repair the damage to your vessel.

07:36.970 --> 07:39.070
He thinks it shouldn't take more than a couple of days.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.890
That is good news.

07:41.710 --> 07:43.380
I certainly hope that...

07:44.070 --> 07:46.380
we'll have the opportunity to repay your kindness.

07:55.260 --> 07:55.980
May I help you?

07:57.350 --> 07:58.530
I'd like to speak with you.

08:00.040 --> 08:00.840
What is it?

08:02.850 --> 08:04.160
Are you feeling ill?

08:05.610 --> 08:08.530
I wanted to ask you about a certain procedure.

08:10.580 --> 08:13.130
I'm sorry.
It's very difficult for me to talk about.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.460
Why don't you, uh, have a seat?

08:18.290 --> 08:20.170
I was about to make some Janaran tea.

08:20.330 --> 08:23.360
- Would you like some?
- Yes, thank you.

08:31.090 --> 08:33.110
- Is everyone in place?
- Yes.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.480
They're just waiting for your signal.

08:37.730 --> 08:39.380
You sound hesitant.

08:41.610 --> 08:43.080
I'm sorry, Pri'Nam,...

08:43.830 --> 08:45.940
but are you certain this is the right thing to do?

08:49.070 --> 08:52.030
Do you think this ship
just came to us by coincidence?

08:53.220 --> 08:55.790
This encounter was clearly ordained by the Makers.

08:56.510 --> 08:58.860
But these people risked their lives to save us.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.570
They desecrated a Sphere.

09:04.890 --> 09:09.410
What we are about to do is not just
for our salvation, but for theirs as well.

09:10.990 --> 09:14.990
I know it can be difficult.
We've been away from home for a long time.

09:15.980 --> 09:19.880
But we have been given the means
to end the bloodshed once and for all.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.590
Don't lose your faith now, Yarrick.

09:23.940 --> 09:25.170
Never, Pri'Nam.

09:30.420 --> 09:33.510
They believe that God-like beings
they call the Makers...

09:34.180 --> 09:36.180
created the Spheres a thousand years ago.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.850
We have determined that the Spheres are nearly
a thousand years old.

09:39.850 --> 09:41.260
Well, they also believe that...

09:41.490 --> 09:45.110
the Makers are using the Spheres to reshape the Expanse, ...

09:46.000 --> 09:48.110
creating a paradise for when they return.

09:49.270 --> 09:51.780
Mythology often has a basis in fact.

09:53.270 --> 09:54.110
Come in.

09:56.590 --> 09:58.000
- Am I disturbing you?
- Not at all.

09:58.560 --> 09:59.360
Excuse me.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.810
I said before that I hoped to be able to repay your kindness.

10:06.900 --> 10:09.250
- That isn't necessary.
-  It's already underway.

10:10.820 --> 10:16.310
Captain Archer, you, your crew, ...

10:16.860 --> 10:19.500
this vessel are all about to embark on a glorious mission.

10:20.690 --> 10:24.860
At this moment, a number of my people have taken
positions around your vessel.

10:25.640 --> 10:29.480
Their bodies have been equipped
with powerful, organic explosives.

10:29.710 --> 10:33.920
With a single command I can order any one of them to sacrifice their lives.

11:04.610 --> 11:06.890
There's been an explosion on C Deck.
We've got a hull breach.

11:07.070 --> 11:09.210
- Seal off the area, get security teams...
- Stop.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.370
Two of my men are positioned next
to your warp reactor.

11:13.720 --> 11:17.480
Unless you turn this ship over to me,
I'll destroy it.

11:50.300 --> 11:51.870
He has severe burns.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.870
The other two are suffering
from the effects of rapid decompression.

11:54.940 --> 11:56.610
They need immediate medical attention.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.450
My orders are to escort everyone...

11:59.530 --> 12:03.000
- to their quarters.
- I will not leave without treating these people.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.000
Watch him.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.860
They say they'll destroy  Enterprise.
I have to believe them.

12:17.010 --> 12:18.540
I can't believe you're going along with this.

12:18.540 --> 12:20.170
Remember what's at stake, why we're out here.

12:20.360 --> 12:24.110
Right now, we don't have a choice.
Don't take any action against them.

12:24.710 --> 12:27.930
- Is that clear?
- Aye, Captain.

12:29.770 --> 12:31.510
This isn't over.

12:34.660 --> 12:36.150
Make yourself at home.

12:48.390 --> 12:49.640
You've made the right decision.

12:51.150 --> 12:54.380
I promise you, your people won't be harmed.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.620
You just murdered one of my people.

13:00.430 --> 13:03.310
I had to erase any doubts
you might have about our resolve.

13:05.370 --> 13:06.620
What do you want with my ship?

13:07.860 --> 13:11.360
When I'm satisfied the situation is secure,
I'll answer your questions.

13:18.940 --> 13:21.430
I also lost a crewman in that explosion, Captain.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.260
I'll say a prayer for them both.

13:27.750 --> 13:28.810
Save your breath.

13:37.970 --> 13:40.060
Were you given the coordinates for Triannon?

13:41.710 --> 13:44.630
Set a course, your highest warp factor.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.830
Prepare to fire two of your torpedoes.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.990
Target my ship's reactor.

13:57.540 --> 13:58.700
You heard me.

14:03.150 --> 14:05.170
Release the docking clamps.

14:31.920 --> 14:33.510
I promised you an explanation.

14:34.370 --> 14:35.490
I owe you that.

14:35.980 --> 14:39.740
- Where are you taking this ship?
- To my home world.

14:41.050 --> 14:42.560
We'll be there in three days.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.400
For the last century,

14:45.460 --> 14:48.620
a violent group of heretics have tried
to undermine our way of life.

14:49.010 --> 14:52.320
With your ship, I can deliver a final,
decisive attack.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.960
I can end this conflict forever.

14:55.610 --> 14:56.360
A war.

14:58.600 --> 15:01.380
That was the "glorious mission"
you were talking about?

15:02.030 --> 15:03.320
I'm trying to save my people.

15:03.560 --> 15:06.120
Why do I have the feeling these "heretics"
would say the same thing?

15:06.680 --> 15:07.560
They might very well...

15:09.150 --> 15:10.560
but it doesn't change what they are...

15:11.460 --> 15:12.660
enemies of the truth.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.980
- Your truth.
- There's only one.

15:18.110 --> 15:20.740
How many people do you intend
to kill with my ship?

15:22.440 --> 15:25.850
Your species is obsessed with numbers...

15:26.650 --> 15:28.870
a characteristic of your misguided belief...

15:29.180 --> 15:32.510
that the secrets of the universe can be
revealed through science.

15:33.460 --> 15:37.150
This may sound barbaric to you,
but it doesn't matter how many heretics die.

15:37.850 --> 15:41.790
When the Makers return,
only the faithful will survive.

15:42.430 --> 15:44.310
Non-believers will be swept away.

15:44.870 --> 15:48.560
Not only Triannons,
but every race within the Chosen Realm.

15:49.540 --> 15:51.220
Doctrines like that make it ...

15:51.970 --> 15:54.630
real easy to wipe out everyone
who doesn't agree with you.

15:55.550 --> 15:58.040
You're wrong. It's not easy.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.830
If it were, I wouldn't be dreading
what I have to do next.

16:06.870 --> 16:08.960
I've been reviewing your records.

16:09.840 --> 16:12.330
You've committed terrible acts of desecration.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.710
Not only have you flown within the cloaking barrier...

16:15.850 --> 16:19.760
of three Spheres, you've landed on one,
and entered another.

16:21.420 --> 16:23.400
For crimes of this magnitude, ...

16:23.680 --> 16:26.870
my faith obligates me to destroy your ship ...

16:27.120 --> 16:29.530
and put your crew to death. However ...

16:32.150 --> 16:33.760
I cannot ignore the fact

16:35.340 --> 16:38.330
that you put yourselves at risk to save us...

16:40.350 --> 16:41.990
and that I like you, Captain.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.670
I believe you're an honorable man.

16:47.260 --> 16:50.180
So, I am going against
what my faith dictates.

16:51.050 --> 16:52.730
I'm going to temper the punishment.

16:55.060 --> 16:58.880
As commander of this ship, you may choose
one member of your crew to give up their life.

16:59.050 --> 17:02.850
- You're out of your mind.
- If you won't choose, I'll choose for you.

17:05.099 --> 17:07.000
I take no pleasure in this, Captain, believe me.

17:09.140 --> 17:10.530
I need time to think about this.

17:12.310 --> 17:13.530
You have six hours.

17:14.780 --> 17:18.109
I urge you to use this time to search within yourself, ...

17:18.300 --> 17:20.390
and put these lies out of your mind.

17:21.609 --> 17:24.130
All of this "data" that you've collected...

17:25.730 --> 17:29.280
must be erased from existence.

17:38.380 --> 17:39.930
Six hours, Captain.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.340
An update on the repairs to your ship.

18:04.670 --> 18:06.360
D'Jamat felt you should be kept apprised.

18:06.950 --> 18:08.520
That's very considerate of him.

18:10.030 --> 18:10.700
Wait a minute.

18:13.970 --> 18:16.650
- Your name's Yarrick, isn't it?
- It is.

18:18.470 --> 18:21.120
I understand your wife paid a visit to Sick Bay.

18:22.020 --> 18:23.390
She had a long talk with my doctor.

18:24.740 --> 18:25.680
She's pregnant.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.070
Yes.

18:28.750 --> 18:31.550
I guess you also know that she wants to end the pregnancy.

18:31.900 --> 18:33.610
That's between her and me.

18:34.860 --> 18:37.290
My doctor got the impression that...

18:37.980 --> 18:41.390
she doesn't exactly agree
with D'Jamat's interpretation of your faith.

18:41.990 --> 18:43.110
As a matter of fact, ...

18:43.480 --> 18:46.740
Phlox said she's grown to hate everything about it.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.570
- That's not true.
-He also got the impression

18:49.820 --> 18:52.250
that you're not happy
with the way things are going, either.

18:52.790 --> 18:56.450
D'Jamat is my spiritual leader.
I will follow him to my death.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.190
From what I've seen,
I'm pretty sure you're going to have that opportunity.

19:10.930 --> 19:12.360
You went to their doctor!

19:12.620 --> 19:14.890
You put us at risk. He told his captain.

19:15.350 --> 19:17.600
- Does D'Jamat know?
- I don't think so.

19:19.850 --> 19:21.020
Did you have the procedure?

19:21.020 --> 19:24.290
No. But the doctor said he needed
time to review our physiology.

19:25.170 --> 19:26.150
He's under guard now.

19:26.150 --> 19:28.050
- It's too late.
- It's just as well.

19:29.290 --> 19:30.580
Have you changed your mind?

19:30.900 --> 19:32.480
I'm not certain it's the right thing to do.

19:32.700 --> 19:36.110
I won't watch my son or daughter
fight in D'Jamat's war.

19:36.210 --> 19:39.290
We have this ship now.
We'll end the war once and for all.

19:39.660 --> 19:41.880
You don't believe that any more than I do.

19:48.560 --> 19:49.460
Enter.

19:52.340 --> 19:53.510
I'm glad you've come.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.100
I was just looking at your captain's logs.

20:02.350 --> 20:04.900
I had no idea we were such kindred spirits.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.740
What makes you think that?

20:07.280 --> 20:10.290
I know why you're here in the...

20:10.820 --> 20:12.140
Expanse.

20:12.740 --> 20:15.080
It turns out we're both fighting
to save our people.

20:15.210 --> 20:17.410
I'm trying to stop my world
from being destroyed.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.100
You're trying to wipe out everyone
who doesn't share your beliefs.

20:21.780 --> 20:24.400
Our situations aren't as different as you think.

20:26.010 --> 20:29.630
- I draw the line at murdering innocent people.
- And not torture?

20:31.280 --> 20:33.670
In your log, there is an incident with a prisoner...

20:33.900 --> 20:36.120
an interrogation that made use of an airlock.

20:36.310 --> 20:38.840
I needed information critical to my mission.

20:40.450 --> 20:43.580
- He wasn't hurt.
- I sympathize with you, Captain.

20:45.140 --> 20:47.200
I've had to make hard choices as well.

20:48.140 --> 20:50.740
When I was young, I fought with the Holy Regiments.

20:51.410 --> 20:52.920
I was commanding a mission.

20:54.070 --> 20:57.440
We had infiltrated a village known
to be a heretic stronghold.

20:59.510 --> 21:01.570
We were instructed to stay concealed and...

21:01.880 --> 21:04.250
relay intelligence about enemy movements.

21:06.300 --> 21:09.020
But one of the villagers discovered us.

21:09.940 --> 21:13.610
It was a small boy,
no more than six years old.

21:16.460 --> 21:19.900
We knew if we let him go,
he would alert the village...

21:21.540 --> 21:23.130
and if we tried to hold him...

21:23.950 --> 21:25.220
he might give us away.

21:27.930 --> 21:29.670
There was only one action to take.

21:33.180 --> 21:34.220
So, I took it.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.220
You're proud of that.

21:41.650 --> 21:43.570
In the service of the Makers...

21:44.340 --> 21:46.570
all actions are blessed ones.

21:46.750 --> 21:47.980
There are no Makers...

21:48.450 --> 21:50.120
at least not how you perceive them.

21:50.420 --> 21:54.870
The Spheres are machines,
built for a reason you and I don't understand.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.890
I was once like you.

21:58.550 --> 21:59.890
But then, I felt the breath.

22:02.510 --> 22:03.900
I prayed for you, Captain.

22:04.670 --> 22:07.410
I'd hoped that the Makers
would open your eyes to the truth.

22:07.890 --> 22:10.410
But it seems that they've turned away.

22:16.530 --> 22:18.190
You had a choice to make.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.440
I've made it.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.440
And which crew member have you selected?

22:24.810 --> 22:26.120
I've chosen myself.

22:29.390 --> 22:30.860
You wanted to kill someone.

22:31.930 --> 22:33.050
Kill me.

22:35.660 --> 22:36.810
I urge you to reconsider.

22:36.930 --> 22:39.870
I won't make someone else pay for something
that happened under my command.

22:40.340 --> 22:41.750
But what about your mission?

22:42.020 --> 22:45.140
When I'm through with your ship,
your crew will need their captain.

22:45.730 --> 22:47.040
T'Pol's a fine commander.

22:48.220 --> 22:50.540
We are more alike than you think, Captain.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.410
I would make the same choice.

22:56.270 --> 22:57.720
I respect your decision.

22:58.990 --> 23:00.720
Then maybe you'll grant a request.

23:01.380 --> 23:05.650
- What is it?
- My people have certain customs regarding death.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.050
There's a device on board.

23:08.350 --> 23:11.050
We use it to dispose of hazardous materials...

23:12.540 --> 23:15.520
but on rare occasions, when the situation arises,...

23:16.410 --> 23:18.290
we've also used it for executions.

23:20.540 --> 23:22.070
It's considered humane.

23:31.740 --> 23:33.050
Where is this device?

23:40.120 --> 23:42.040
The molecules have been disassembled.

23:44.270 --> 23:45.800
Quick and painless.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.110
I can't change your mind?

23:52.250 --> 23:54.090
No more than I can change yours.

23:55.220 --> 23:57.590
Very well. Proceed.

24:02.010 --> 24:04.990
- Captain...
- Ask Phlox to keep an eye on Porthos.

24:10.660 --> 24:12.400
Take care of Enterprise.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.740
This won't end here.

24:46.190 --> 24:47.560
You have my sympathies.

24:48.870 --> 24:50.280
You should inform your crew.

24:50.620 --> 24:51.980
They deserve to know.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.190
You've been quiet.

25:10.150 --> 25:12.070
I'm just thinking about what's ahead, Pri'Nam.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.490
I know you too well.

25:18.410 --> 25:19.490
Tell me what's wrong.

25:23.020 --> 25:26.150
We've just begun this mission,
and already three people are dead.

25:26.450 --> 25:27.580
And that bothers you.

25:28.020 --> 25:29.190
Shouldn't it?

25:29.830 --> 25:33.920
- These people are not our enemy.
- They are non-believers.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.920
That makes them our enemy.

25:37.600 --> 25:38.750
Why?

25:41.430 --> 25:47.650
- Do you believe the Makers speak through me?
- Yes.

25:48.030 --> 25:50.460
Then when you question me, you question the Makers...

25:52.110 --> 25:53.460
and there's a word for that...

25:54.840 --> 25:55.780
"heresy".

25:57.900 --> 25:58.780
Yarrick...

26:00.480 --> 26:02.770
when you begin to sympathize with the enemy, ...

26:03.570 --> 26:06.610
you risk becoming the enemy.

26:51.750 --> 26:52.870
Can I help you?

27:17.700 --> 27:18.560
I know.

27:19.270 --> 27:21.440
Medical scans are against your beliefs.

27:22.890 --> 27:25.050
I don't think the Makers will mind.

27:46.060 --> 27:46.880
Enter.

27:47.900 --> 27:50.390
Lyaal is missing. He's not at his station.

27:50.620 --> 27:51.640
Lyaal...

27:53.730 --> 27:54.850
Lyaal?

27:56.320 --> 27:58.530
We'll use the ship's internal sensors to find him.

27:58.750 --> 28:00.230
I need to locate one of my men.

28:03.160 --> 28:05.870
- We're dropping out of warp.
- Main power is being disrupted.

28:06.240 --> 28:07.340
From where?

28:09.410 --> 28:11.270
I can't identify the location.

28:19.470 --> 28:20.900
I'm telling you, I didn't do anything.

28:21.020 --> 28:22.330
Ask your flunky over here.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.260
He's been looking over my shoulder the whole time.

28:25.440 --> 28:28.100
It's true. He never left my sight.

28:29.960 --> 28:32.010
This did not happen by accident.

28:32.610 --> 28:37.570
Pri'Nam, there's something wrong with
the EPS manifolds on Deck D, section J-15.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.040
Yarrick.

28:39.250 --> 28:40.110
Go with him.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.140
It's on the left.

28:50.130 --> 28:51.530
You passed it.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.230
You don't want to do that.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.700
You can't win. They'll destroy the ship.

28:57.570 --> 28:58.710
Not if you help me.

28:59.310 --> 29:00.000
No.

29:00.980 --> 29:02.210
You know this is wrong...

29:03.490 --> 29:04.800
everything he's doing.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.390
We can put a stop to it, all of it.

29:07.820 --> 29:10.440
- I won't betray my faith.
- Your faith betrayed you.

29:11.530 --> 29:13.080
Is this really what the Makers' want:...

29:13.730 --> 29:16.320
to kill people by the thousands in their name?

29:16.600 --> 29:17.860
Is that the faith you were raised in?

29:19.890 --> 29:21.660
- No.
- Then do what's right.

29:22.970 --> 29:24.260
If you don't help me,...

29:25.380 --> 29:27.850
you'll be condemning your wife and child to death,...

29:28.460 --> 29:30.160
because that's how this is going to end.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.510
As long as people like...

29:32.770 --> 29:35.880
D'Jamat dictate what's true and what isn't...

29:38.520 --> 29:40.320
...all you'll ever have is war.

29:46.280 --> 29:49.630
- Have you located Lyaal?
- Internal sensors aren't functioning.

29:49.680 --> 29:51.410
Systems are down all over the ship.

29:54.410 --> 29:57.380
- What is it?
- There's a convoy of ships approaching.

29:59.310 --> 30:00.380
Let me see them.

30:04.660 --> 30:06.010
These people you're fighting...

30:07.050 --> 30:08.680
what makes them heretics?

30:09.620 --> 30:12.870
We believe the Makers created
the Chosen Realm in nine days.

30:13.540 --> 30:15.120
They believe it took ten.

30:17.580 --> 30:19.460
For that, you've been at war for over a century?

30:21.920 --> 30:22.750
Found it.

30:23.610 --> 30:24.470
What is it?

30:24.770 --> 30:27.300
The environmental controls need
to be rerouted to Sickbay...

30:27.450 --> 30:30.050
that can only be done from the Bridge,
I'm going to show you how to do it.

30:30.780 --> 30:34.480
- Why?
- Dr. Phlox has synthesized an airborne agent.

30:34.740 --> 30:39.560
It neutralizes one of the enzymes used
in the organic explosives, renders it inert.

30:40.710 --> 30:41.790
They're hailing us.

30:45.150 --> 30:46.270
Surrender now.

30:46.500 --> 30:50.990
- I have four ships.
- If you had ten ships, you wouldn't survive against this vessel.

30:51.730 --> 30:53.990
Run your scans.
You'll see that I'm telling the truth.

30:55.010 --> 30:57.310
Surrender, and you'll be treated fairly.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.480
You consider us heretics.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.960
We know what you do to them, D'Jamat.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.940
Target the lead vessel.

31:08.140 --> 31:10.510
- Do what I say!
-  No.

31:16.910 --> 31:18.590
Prepare to fire torpedoes.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.540
One of the ships has lost engines.

31:35.680 --> 31:36.990
Target their main reactor.

32:01.340 --> 32:02.850
Don't worry, it's harmless.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.010
Unless it's agitated.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.010
Captain.

32:20.470 --> 32:23.010
We have to get to the armory.
We're retaking the ship.

32:23.870 --> 32:25.090
We need the MACOs.

32:28.170 --> 32:29.990
Pri'Nam, It's begun.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.360
What's the status of the engines?

32:32.610 --> 32:34.530
We've located the problem.
It's under repair.

32:36.150 --> 32:38.480
The warp reactor should be functioning
in a few hours.

32:38.630 --> 32:40.710
- They're retreating.
- Stay with them.

32:44.460 --> 32:45.780
Do what I say!

32:55.930 --> 32:57.600
Bring us within firing distance.

32:58.050 --> 32:59.500
Prepare to lock weapons.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.280
Careful!
There's no antidote for the venom!

33:13.330 --> 33:16.390
There'll be an extra helping of snow
beetles for you tonight, young lady.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.530
Their engines are at maximum.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.620
- We're still gaining.
- Good.

33:41.780 --> 33:43.950
We'll eliminate them one by one.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.159
Hold your fire!

34:37.010 --> 34:37.850
Don't move.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.100
They're coming into range.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.100
Lock weapons.

36:32.110 --> 36:33.620
They're sending a transmission.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.200
- They want to surrender.
- Continue firing.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.170
Weapons aren't functioning.

36:41.470 --> 36:43.240
Archer to the Bridge.

36:43.900 --> 36:46.240
We have rerouted command functions to Engineering.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.110
I've taken the weapons offline.

36:49.340 --> 36:50.400
Find him.

36:51.460 --> 36:54.040
We've also neutralized your organic explosives.

36:54.510 --> 36:55.400
You're lying.

36:55.670 --> 36:57.840
Go ahead. Try to blow yourself up.

36:58.140 --> 36:59.160
I'll wait.

37:01.250 --> 37:03.230
Stand down before anyone else gets hurt.

37:04.330 --> 37:06.580
- You know I won't do that.
-  Pri'Nam...

37:08.540 --> 37:09.580
they're coming about.

37:12.350 --> 37:14.150
They're firing again, Captain!

37:16.110 --> 37:18.600
I suggest you bring your weapons back on-line!

37:26.170 --> 37:29.000
Are you willing to sacrifice
the lives of your crew?!

38:02.480 --> 38:04.040
Captain, it's Reed.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.830
We have the Bridge.

38:07.450 --> 38:09.370
This would be a lot easier
if I had weapons back.

38:10.020 --> 38:10.900
Stand by.

38:30.330 --> 38:31.050
Hail them.

38:39.220 --> 38:40.440
This is Captain Archer.

38:42.290 --> 38:44.990
D'Jamat is not longer
in control of this vessel.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.640
Please respond.

38:51.350 --> 38:52.880
We've retaken the ship.

38:54.150 --> 38:55.560
I'm in command again.

38:56.040 --> 38:59.920
- And why should I believe you?
- I'm powering down my weapons.

39:04.490 --> 39:05.960
See for yourself.

39:18.810 --> 39:19.940
They're moving off.

39:38.310 --> 39:40.370
We just entered orbit around Triannon.

39:40.750 --> 39:41.690
Let's go.

39:43.650 --> 39:45.590
You've done a terrible thing, Captain.

39:47.240 --> 39:49.960
You've interfered with something
that was ordained.

39:50.470 --> 39:52.250
After centuries of fighting, ...

39:52.860 --> 39:55.680
I was going to bring an end to the war.
We would have had peace.

39:55.780 --> 39:56.660
Peace...

39:57.300 --> 39:59.200
One of my crewman is dead, six others are wounded,...

39:59.200 --> 40:01.590
- my ship is damaged...
- None of that is important!

40:02.500 --> 40:04.420
All that matters is the sacred truth.

40:06.750 --> 40:07.670
You want truth?

40:09.980 --> 40:11.390
I'll show you some truth.

41:09.450 --> 41:12.740
From what we've been able to learn,
this happened eight months ago.

41:13.450 --> 41:14.860
Both sides have been decimated.

41:15.990 --> 41:17.850
There are no major cities left.

41:18.790 --> 41:19.670
Millions...

41:20.450 --> 41:21.240
are dead.

41:24.380 --> 41:26.460
Your faith was going to bring peace?

41:29.720 --> 41:30.540
Here it is.

41:31.305 --> 41:37.306
