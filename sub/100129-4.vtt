‐ Congratulations, bladesmiths.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.675
You've made it to the second
round of this competition.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.135
Now that those blades
have been tempered,

16:51.135 --> 16:53.137
it's time to make those
fully functional weapons

16:53.137 --> 16:54.639
by attaching handles to them.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.849
Remember, gentlemen,
this is a mash‐up.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.727
So make sure you incorporate
the best design elements

16:59.727 --> 17:01.604

you chose

17:01.604 --> 17:03.397

overall construction.

17:03.397 --> 17:06.400
And if you thought that forging
a blade in three hours

17:06.400 --> 17:08.402
was tough, well,
it's not gonna get any easier

17:08.402 --> 17:11.739
because you have just two hours
to get them ready for testing

17:11.739 --> 17:13.950
where we will test them
for strength and durability

17:13.950 --> 17:15.117

17:23.042 --> 17:24.835
