00:47.125 --> 00:48.083
Dammit.

00:51.958 --> 00:53.291
Don't shoot.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.958
Emergency, gentlemen. Jeez.

04:46.708 --> 04:49.041
Go! Go MK!

04:56.708 --> 04:57.875
Where are you going now?

05:46.625 --> 05:47.708
No way…

06:13.583 --> 06:14.583
Homeless.

06:58.041 --> 06:59.333
Take this street!

07:16.583 --> 07:19.166
Piss off! I'll kill you!

07:20.125 --> 07:21.125
What now?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
-Let's go!
-He's trying to kill us. Move!

07:52.291 --> 07:54.125
You're driving right past it!

07:57.250 --> 07:58.166
Reverse.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.208
Go in, brother!

08:12.583 --> 08:15.125
-Go, Masego! Let's move.
-Masego, no way man!

08:52.458 --> 08:55.166
Comrades, get moving.
We need to find a way out.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.500
Masego! Wake up!
What do you think you're doing?

09:05.583 --> 09:07.875
Masego, don't do this to me!

09:12.958 --> 09:16.208
Masego, I'm begging you.

09:22.833 --> 09:23.833
Hurry up, you must go.

09:23.916 --> 09:25.291
Quickly, go.

09:47.458 --> 09:49.250
Fuck you!

09:53.833 --> 09:55.416
Terra! We need to move!

10:09.500 --> 10:11.291
I think it's Pieter!

10:11.375 --> 10:13.375
Pieter, are you okay?

10:18.500 --> 10:20.333
Hold on, buddy, hold on.

10:30.625 --> 10:33.208
Hold on, they are on their way.

10:40.583 --> 10:42.291
Men, search the whole building.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.708
Go up there! Every car as well.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.875
Let's get out of here!

12:38.583 --> 12:40.583
Press, Aldo, press!

12:44.833 --> 12:46.458
Get out of the way!

12:48.875 --> 12:50.833
-Let's go, guys!
-Go!

13:05.458 --> 13:07.083
Let's go!

13:14.125 --> 13:15.625
Go past!

13:19.333 --> 13:20.583
Keep going!

14:08.208 --> 14:09.958
Rabbi, get down! Down!

14:10.041 --> 14:11.375
Move, clear!

14:31.083 --> 14:32.041
Go past!

14:44.916 --> 14:46.625
What kind of shit is this?

14:55.333 --> 14:57.000
Hurry, Ma. Go!

15:52.333 --> 15:53.875
Gents, what are we gonna do?

16:29.083 --> 16:30.916
What do you think you're doing, boy?

16:50.875 --> 16:52.500
You didn't say he's Black.

16:55.041 --> 16:57.375
Johan, let him go. Johan.

18:29.916 --> 18:31.166
Hold fast!

18:31.250 --> 18:32.250
Hold fast!

20:15.708 --> 20:17.625
What's this? Hello.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.750
Looks like this one has issues.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.750
Sit down! Don't get on my nerves.

20:42.666 --> 20:45.083
Ladies too. Let's go.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.041
I know.

22:33.375 --> 22:34.916
How's he know our names?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.541
Never mind our names.
How did he know about the mission?

22:41.375 --> 22:44.791
-Maybe the truck driver?
-No. All the truck driver knew

22:44.875 --> 22:47.458
was to meet us there
and drive us in. That's it.

22:47.541 --> 22:49.125
This guy knew everything.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.708
Don't look at me.

23:04.416 --> 23:07.250
I lost Masego today. Don't piss me off.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.666
There were other units
where we left Masego.

23:42.041 --> 23:44.916
I'm Captain Langerman.
South African Police.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.875
We met outside the bank.

28:53.375 --> 28:54.208
Let's go.

29:31.916 --> 29:32.916
Shoot!

29:35.833 --> 29:37.708
-Shoot!
-Get up!

29:42.916 --> 29:44.458
Shoot!

29:47.166 --> 29:49.291
Come out of there,
you dog. Come out!

29:50.000 --> 29:51.750
Come on, dog. Move.

29:59.541 --> 30:02.541
-Why aren't you shooting?
-Do not fire.

30:09.083 --> 30:10.833
Move. Move, dog.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.333
Sit down!

30:36.541 --> 30:38.416
We've lost the signal.

30:47.666 --> 30:50.125
You're a piece of crap.

31:33.541 --> 31:35.375
This dog nearly had us killed.

31:37.500 --> 31:38.625
Please…

31:44.125 --> 31:45.125
Come here.

31:50.666 --> 31:51.500
And now?

31:51.583 --> 31:52.416
Get in…

31:52.500 --> 31:53.500
Let's go.

31:55.416 --> 31:56.666
Let's go.

31:59.916 --> 32:00.750
Get in.

32:00.833 --> 32:01.708
Get in!

32:12.708 --> 32:13.541
Get up.

32:27.083 --> 32:28.333
Talk!

32:28.416 --> 32:29.625
-I don't know.
-Lies!

32:45.125 --> 32:46.375
Go cool off.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.416
The Little Crocodile is here.

34:05.500 --> 34:07.291
The Little Crocodile is here.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.791
Captain Langerman.

34:39.875 --> 34:41.291
Brigadier.

34:41.375 --> 34:44.541
The Big Crocodile is dying to see you.
And he's on the warpath.

34:44.625 --> 34:47.416
-Brigadier, we've been on this case--
-I'm not talking to you.

34:50.750 --> 34:51.833
What's that?

34:52.750 --> 34:54.416
It's a helicopter, Brigadier.

34:54.500 --> 34:56.500
I know what it is, Schoeman.

34:57.458 --> 34:59.958
But why is it standing there?
In front of Uncle Paul?

35:01.250 --> 35:02.166
Fix it.

35:06.625 --> 35:08.250
Oh, and…

35:08.333 --> 35:11.041
Have you seen the bank manifest?

35:14.166 --> 35:19.833
The Justice Minister's daughter,
Christine, is one of the hostages.

35:20.791 --> 35:22.125
Really, sir?

35:25.916 --> 35:26.875
Yes, Schoeman.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.333
Really.

35:28.958 --> 35:30.500
That's why I'm here.

35:30.583 --> 35:34.583
With all the horses, the dogs,
the guns, the soldiers, and everything.

35:39.625 --> 35:41.250
This crap stops now.

35:41.958 --> 35:43.500
Do you understand me, Captain?

37:41.833 --> 37:43.000
What's the plan?

38:30.208 --> 38:31.666
Khumalo. You're starting again.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.416
Let's not give them any other way.

40:39.083 --> 40:41.125
NOW MORE THAN 1000 000 000 STRONGER.

40:46.500 --> 40:47.916
Dear Lord

40:48.416 --> 40:49.791
We pray to you…

42:53.958 --> 42:55.125
My love.

43:36.541 --> 43:37.750
I didn't get that.

44:37.375 --> 44:39.125
Calm down, please.

45:03.291 --> 45:04.916
Dammit.

45:56.541 --> 45:58.500
Khumalo, what are you doing?

45:58.583 --> 46:00.083
Khumalo! Talk to me.

46:26.541 --> 46:27.958
Aldo, my machine gun.

46:39.291 --> 46:40.583
Get ready.

46:55.750 --> 46:57.458
Take them now.

46:57.541 --> 46:59.625
No, wait, Brigadier,
something's not right.

47:00.333 --> 47:02.333
There they are, standing outside.

47:03.000 --> 47:03.833
Shoot them.

47:03.916 --> 47:06.833
No, one of those three
isn't one of our suspects.

47:06.916 --> 47:09.875
I didn't say he's one of our suspects.
I gave you an order.

47:09.958 --> 47:11.000
Shoot the bastards now.

47:12.166 --> 47:13.875
Calvin is cunning as a jackal.

47:15.208 --> 47:17.375
He wouldn't just expose himself like that.

47:17.458 --> 47:19.583
I think that man might be a hostage.

47:20.916 --> 47:23.083
Now you listen to me, Captain.

47:23.166 --> 47:24.416
I gave you an order.

49:25.333 --> 49:28.875
-Power to the people!
-Power to the people!

49:32.958 --> 49:35.458
You nearly caused
an international incident.

49:35.541 --> 49:37.500
That was an American hostage.

49:37.583 --> 49:39.916
But he's Black!

49:42.583 --> 49:44.958
I couldn't care less that he's American.

49:46.416 --> 49:47.625
Shut them up!

49:48.666 --> 49:52.875
Get rid of this damn disturbance.
I do not want to hear them!

50:01.291 --> 50:05.541
Power to the people!

50:31.583 --> 50:32.791
No, Khumalo.

50:39.833 --> 50:42.000
That bloody captain
is a piece of shit.

50:43.625 --> 50:44.708
I swear…

50:54.541 --> 50:55.458
Excuse me.

50:59.041 --> 51:01.791
Erasmus, please
deal with this dog before I kill him.

51:18.833 --> 51:21.333
Christine, you mad?
What do you think you're doing?

53:13.333 --> 53:14.458
Let's go.

57:07.375 --> 57:08.875
What are you doing?

57:46.666 --> 57:48.375
See you later.

57:50.583 --> 57:52.625
-Doesn't wanna come out.
-Why not?

59:04.708 --> 59:05.958
No.

59:06.583 --> 59:09.500
-How do you mean "No," Brigadier?
-Because I say no.

59:09.583 --> 59:12.750
We could use her to persuade
Christine to come out of the bank.

59:14.375 --> 59:16.625
Let me explain something to you both.

59:16.708 --> 59:19.291
You want us to turn a maid

59:19.375 --> 59:21.958
into a heroine on national television?

59:23.250 --> 59:24.958
How desperate do you want us to look?

59:29.583 --> 59:30.416
Fuck.

59:34.833 --> 59:35.750
Fuck.

59:38.541 --> 59:39.583
Captain!

59:40.250 --> 59:42.458
If your plan doesn't work, mine will.

1:00:17.791 --> 1:00:19.666
Hurry up. Don't have all day.

1:01:10.416 --> 1:01:12.583
That's definitely shots. Go!

1:01:20.125 --> 1:01:21.916
Khumalo, shoot him, man!

1:01:42.041 --> 1:01:43.208
Get up, dog.

1:01:57.625 --> 1:01:59.083
Terra, let me have a look…

1:01:59.166 --> 1:02:00.250
I'm all right.

1:02:47.375 --> 1:02:48.750
Not now, man.

1:08:05.208 --> 1:08:07.291
Pastor. I'm doing my best.

1:10:00.375 --> 1:10:01.416
Dog.

1:10:12.375 --> 1:10:14.125
Khumalo, what does he want in here?

1:10:21.166 --> 1:10:22.458
Don't stress, Terra.

1:10:47.250 --> 1:10:49.625
People outside
are worried about you.

1:10:50.375 --> 1:10:51.916
Come with me, please.

1:10:53.625 --> 1:10:54.541
No.

1:11:50.083 --> 1:11:51.583
Terra, what are you doing?

1:14:23.083 --> 1:14:24.458
Terra, what did you do?

1:14:29.125 --> 1:14:30.875
I should shoot you in the head.

1:15:41.166 --> 1:15:43.416
I agree, Honorable Minister.

1:15:44.750 --> 1:15:45.583
Yes.

1:15:46.458 --> 1:15:47.666
Naturally.

1:15:47.750 --> 1:15:49.791
I will make absolutely sure of it.

1:15:51.291 --> 1:15:53.083
Thank you, Honorable Minister.

1:16:05.291 --> 1:16:06.541
Get ready to breach.

1:16:06.625 --> 1:16:08.541
What? What about the hostages?

1:16:08.625 --> 1:16:10.458
-No longer important.
-Brigadier…

1:16:11.041 --> 1:16:13.541
One of them just died. They're vulnerable.

1:16:13.625 --> 1:16:15.375
They could surrender, Brigadier.

1:16:15.458 --> 1:16:17.250
We can find a peaceful solution.

1:16:17.333 --> 1:16:19.583
You think that after
what happened in there

1:16:19.666 --> 1:16:21.125
that you can convince him?

1:16:21.208 --> 1:16:22.875
When I was in the bank

1:16:22.958 --> 1:16:26.625
I saw a man
who wasn't prepared to pull the trigger.

1:16:27.208 --> 1:16:30.708
He could have kept me hostage
but he didn't. Why?

1:16:31.833 --> 1:16:36.208
I think this whole situation,
the violence, the murder

1:16:36.291 --> 1:16:37.791
it's consuming him.

1:16:38.416 --> 1:16:42.916
You want me to believe
that damn terrorist in there

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.250
is a good man?

1:16:44.333 --> 1:16:45.375
No.

1:16:46.166 --> 1:16:47.291
What I'm saying

1:16:47.375 --> 1:16:49.291
is that Calvin Khumalo

1:16:49.375 --> 1:16:51.625
is fighting for justice.

1:16:52.333 --> 1:16:54.916
And he doesn't want to lose more people.

1:16:55.916 --> 1:16:57.041
And that's

1:16:58.291 --> 1:16:59.666
your problem.

1:17:01.083 --> 1:17:02.791
You think that trash in there

1:17:03.541 --> 1:17:04.500
are people.

1:17:11.375 --> 1:17:12.458
Out!

1:18:30.541 --> 1:18:33.166
We are only human
through other human beings.

1:18:33.250 --> 1:18:36.125
We are only human
through other human beings.

1:20:10.458 --> 1:20:12.291
Think of your family.

1:20:12.875 --> 1:20:15.166
Of your father. Please.

1:20:15.250 --> 1:20:16.166
Father.

1:20:16.250 --> 1:20:17.958
Please, Father, I implore you.

1:20:18.041 --> 1:20:19.500
I know you can see me.

1:20:19.583 --> 1:20:21.000
Do what they ask. Please.

1:20:21.083 --> 1:20:22.375
Do the right thing.

1:20:51.083 --> 1:20:53.041
Officers, come and fetch this woman.

1:21:00.208 --> 1:21:01.250
Stand down.

1:21:01.958 --> 1:21:03.041
Stand down.

1:21:46.083 --> 1:21:48.250
Come on, Christine. Come on.

1:22:46.416 --> 1:22:48.666
It's a matter of national security.

1:22:48.750 --> 1:22:49.916
Come with me.

1:23:52.375 --> 1:23:53.416
I'm tired.

1:23:58.458 --> 1:23:59.375
I know.

1:24:03.500 --> 1:24:04.875
I know.

1:24:12.916 --> 1:24:15.125
Don't let them worry you.

1:24:15.208 --> 1:24:16.708
You did the right thing.

1:24:17.708 --> 1:24:20.208
-We'll look after you, soldier.
-Thank you, Brigadier.

1:24:20.833 --> 1:24:21.916
Dismissed.

1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:36.875
Khumalo, you have a phone call.

1:29:13.875 --> 1:29:14.916
Thank you.

1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:00.041
Langerman, go home.

1:30:00.125 --> 1:30:02.083
Spend some time with your wife.

1:30:02.166 --> 1:30:03.875
That's an order.

1:30:04.875 --> 1:30:06.708
Because you are now done.

1:30:40.166 --> 1:30:41.208
Move in.

1:30:58.375 --> 1:30:59.333
Father!

1:31:08.208 --> 1:31:11.333
We kill dogs!

1:31:20.333 --> 1:31:22.375
Fuck you!

1:31:30.291 --> 1:31:32.041
This will be easy!

1:31:52.666 --> 1:31:54.250
Bastards!

1:31:59.416 --> 1:32:00.750
We showed them.

1:32:00.833 --> 1:32:02.583
We showed those dogs.

1:32:07.375 --> 1:32:09.666
-We made them dance.
-Yeah.

1:32:11.708 --> 1:32:13.916
You know those dogs got me.

1:32:16.666 --> 1:32:17.958
This is just a graze.

1:32:50.500 --> 1:32:51.500
Hold fast.

1:32:52.875 --> 1:32:53.875
Hold fast.

1:32:56.666 --> 1:32:57.791
Dammit.

1:32:59.875 --> 1:33:01.291
Get ready to go in.
