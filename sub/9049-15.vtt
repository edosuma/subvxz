WEBVTT

00:02.472 --> 00:04.272
Don't you just love Halloween?

00:04.274 --> 00:06.575
Creepy costumes,
boatloads of candy...

00:06.577 --> 00:09.845
Dez trying to scare us with the
same lame trick every year.

00:09.847 --> 00:13.348
You scared me.

00:13.350 --> 00:15.217
Aww! I was supposed
to scare you.

00:15.219 --> 00:18.854
Quick, put my lid back on.
Maybe I can get Trish. Whoo!

00:20.223 --> 00:21.823
Hey, guys.

00:23.226 --> 00:24.459
- Boo!
- Hey, Dez.

00:24.461 --> 00:26.294
Oh man!

00:26.296 --> 00:29.297
Guess who booked Ally a
concert in New York!

00:29.299 --> 00:31.600
And, even better,

00:31.602 --> 00:35.237
guess who got us tickets to the
hottest Halloween party in New York!

00:35.239 --> 00:37.639
No way! The central
park spook-tacular?

00:37.641 --> 00:40.275
- Awesome!
- You might also say

00:40.277 --> 00:42.210
booking a huge concert
in New York City

00:42.212 --> 00:44.346
is kinda awesome, but whatever.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.882
Ooh! We should do
a group costume,

00:46.884 --> 00:49.718
- like a box of crayons!
- Ooh! Or the four seasons!

00:49.720 --> 00:53.355
Yeah, like salt, pepper,
oregano, and paprika.

00:53.357 --> 00:56.758
- Those are seasonings.
- Oh.

00:57.727 --> 00:59.628
How about we go as
a group of people

00:59.630 --> 01:02.798
excited to see their friend
perform in New York City?

01:02.800 --> 01:05.233
Ehh. What would that
even look like?

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:18.674 --> 02:22.577
Ugh. Dez, I can't believe you
ruined our group costume.

02:22.579 --> 02:24.813
We were supposed to be a b.L.T.
Sandwich.

02:24.815 --> 02:27.616
Right. I'm the "l"... lemon.

02:27.618 --> 02:30.418
The "l" stands for "lettuce."

02:30.420 --> 02:33.421
Ugh! Who'd eat a bacon,
lettuce, and tomato sandwich?

02:33.423 --> 02:36.424
Who would eat a bacon,
lemon, and tomato sandwich?

02:36.426 --> 02:38.360
Uh, me.

02:39.328 --> 02:43.098
Mmm! It's tart.

02:44.667 --> 02:47.736
Hey, there's a spooky storytelling
contest at the party tonight.

02:47.738 --> 02:48.875
We should enter!

02:48.906 --> 02:52.641
Ooh! I just thought of
the perfect scary story.

02:52.643 --> 02:54.476
Listen.

02:55.478 --> 02:58.380
There once was an old woman
who lived in a shoe...

03:00.516 --> 03:03.518
Dez, this is "the old woman
who lived in a shoe."

03:03.520 --> 03:05.120
It's a nursery rhyme!

03:07.423 --> 03:09.958
- Oh yeah.
- Okay.

03:09.960 --> 03:13.562
I have a scary story that can
actually win us the contest.

03:14.564 --> 03:20.669
On a dark and stormy night, a U.F.O.
Crashed onto an old, deserted highway

03:20.671 --> 03:23.438
near the mall of Miami.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.509
A bus of travelers had to pull over
and wait for the road to be repaired,

03:27.511 --> 03:30.445
among them a crazy,
old prospector,

03:30.447 --> 03:35.717
a ditsy actress, and an extremely
handsome British accountant.

03:40.556 --> 03:44.426
Evening, folks. Officer
pat, mall security.

03:44.428 --> 03:48.430
After that unidentified flying object
crashed into the middle of the road,

03:48.432 --> 03:51.933
we have heard reports of
some not-so-normal activity.

03:51.935 --> 03:54.703
Some may say... paranormal!

03:58.009 --> 04:01.409
The only thing not normal here
is that there's seven of us

04:01.411 --> 04:03.144
in a food court
without any food!

04:03.146 --> 04:05.880
Now, where can I get some grits?

04:05.882 --> 04:08.016
Wait. Seven people?

04:08.018 --> 04:09.918
But there were only...

04:09.920 --> 04:11.720
Six of us on the bus!

04:11.722 --> 04:15.490
Huh. So that means...

04:15.492 --> 04:17.591
Someone here must be extra.

04:17.594 --> 04:20.595
Some may say...
extraterrestrial!

04:24.600 --> 04:28.436
So, what you're saying is
one of us is an alien?

04:28.438 --> 04:30.939
Eww! Gross!

04:31.941 --> 04:36.011
Alien? Sweet shepherd's pie! Do
you know what aliens do to you?

04:36.013 --> 04:40.649
They abduct you, cut you up, put you
in jars, and do experiments on you!

04:40.651 --> 04:43.985
We've got to find out who the
alien is before it kills us all!

04:43.987 --> 04:46.488
Ehh!

04:46.490 --> 04:48.923
This alien's probably
here for my gold!

04:48.925 --> 04:54.562
But he can't have it! He'd have to
pry it from my cold, dead fingers.

04:54.564 --> 04:57.565
What's to say you're
not the alien?

04:58.534 --> 05:02.637
Yeah. Your bushy beard,
your bugged-out eyes.

05:02.639 --> 05:05.473
That totally foul body odor.

05:05.475 --> 05:09.077
Oh. You noticed my
man scent, did ya?

05:11.547 --> 05:13.181
It's hard not to notice.

05:14.750 --> 05:17.519
Well, clearly, I
am not the alien.

05:17.521 --> 05:20.155
I'm too pretty to be an alien.

05:20.157 --> 05:22.090
Me too.

05:23.492 --> 05:26.995
I think it's pretty obvious
which one of you is the alien.

05:26.997 --> 05:29.097
That guy!

05:30.633 --> 05:35.103
Who? Gleep-gloop? No way! I
sat next to him on the bus!

05:35.105 --> 05:38.773
- But he's green!
- Some people are green.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.643
What about that third eye?

05:41.645 --> 05:43.678
He told me it's a birthmark.

05:45.514 --> 05:48.850
We've got to find out which one of
us is an alien before it's too late!

05:48.852 --> 05:51.686
If aliens attack, our
chances of survival are...

05:52.822 --> 05:57.559
Pi, diameter, calculus,
square root, carry the seven,

05:57.561 --> 05:59.260
fractions, fish 'n' chips...

06:00.296 --> 06:03.665
Zero percent! We're doomed!
We're all doomed!

06:04.633 --> 06:07.535
I know how to tell which
one of us is the alien.

06:07.537 --> 06:10.705
We chop off each other's arms
and see who bleeds green!

06:13.642 --> 06:15.276
Now, who's going first?

06:15.278 --> 06:17.879
I pick you, pretty lady.

06:29.692 --> 06:33.862
Bangers and mash! She was
the alien all along!

06:33.864 --> 06:36.264
What an unexpected twist!

06:36.266 --> 06:38.333
I didn't see that coming.

06:38.335 --> 06:41.002
I guess I owe you an
apology, gleep-gloop.

06:46.108 --> 06:50.178
And the alien was
never seen again.

06:50.180 --> 06:53.014
That story was lame.

06:53.016 --> 06:56.618
What's so scary about an alien
hanging out at the mall?

06:56.620 --> 06:58.353
Oh, wait, I forgot one part.

06:59.655 --> 07:01.623
Just then...

07:07.029 --> 07:11.800
And to think I almost left without
doing what I came here to do.

07:11.802 --> 07:13.802
To kiss me?

07:14.770 --> 07:17.972
Eww! Gross! No!

07:17.974 --> 07:21.276
I'm here to cut you up
and put you in jars.

07:31.687 --> 07:34.856
All right, Austin, I'll admit your
alien story gave me the chills.

07:34.858 --> 07:37.859
- Maybe we should use it for the contest.
- Uh, guys.

07:37.861 --> 07:40.628
Those two Michael Jacksons have
been staring at us for a while.

07:42.731 --> 07:44.866
Sorry to stare. I
just have to say

07:44.868 --> 07:48.203
- I'm a big fan.
- You're a fan of Austin's music?

07:48.205 --> 07:50.772
No, I'm a fan of bacon.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.907
I'm so hungry.

07:52.909 --> 07:55.243
You're always hungry.

07:55.245 --> 07:58.213
Well, excuse me, but
humans need to eat.

07:59.648 --> 08:02.350
I mean, not that
you're not human.

08:02.352 --> 08:05.787
It's just inhuman, the way
you treat me sometimes.

08:08.058 --> 08:11.759
Why can't you be the one
with the off switch?

08:17.666 --> 08:20.935
This creepy room is
perfect for storytelling.

08:20.937 --> 08:22.904
Yeah, and I just
thought of a story

08:22.906 --> 08:26.741
that'll make the little, tiny hairs
on the bottom of your feet stand up.

08:26.743 --> 08:29.811
Who has little, tiny hairs
on the bottom of their feet?

08:29.813 --> 08:31.713
Uh... no one.

08:32.681 --> 08:34.816
Now, once upon a time,

08:34.818 --> 08:38.686
there was a German brother and
sister who got lost in the forest.

08:39.955 --> 08:42.690
Their names...
Hansel and Gretel.

08:43.759 --> 08:46.461
Dez, this is the story
of Hansel and Gretel.

08:46.463 --> 08:49.364
It's a fairytale.

08:51.133 --> 08:52.901
Oh yeah.

08:52.903 --> 08:54.936
All right, I have a story.

08:54.938 --> 08:58.206
It was a dark and stormy night,

08:58.208 --> 09:02.744
when an extremely beautiful
young girl got a new cellphone.

09:03.879 --> 09:06.347
You need to check out
this new phone I bought.

09:06.349 --> 09:08.950
It's got a better camera,
more storage space,

09:08.952 --> 09:11.319
and it came with a selfie-stick.

09:11.321 --> 09:14.055
- Say "besties"!
- Besties

09:15.926 --> 09:19.160
They've also upgraded to this
new operating system, eerie.

09:19.162 --> 09:23.031
It can do anything you ask it.
Watch.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.235
How may I be of assistance?

09:27.237 --> 09:29.804
Eerie, where's the best
place to go to dinner?

09:29.806 --> 09:32.874
I suggest Vadurro's ristorante.

09:32.876 --> 09:35.977
Their special tonight is
veggie lasagna, your favorite,

09:35.979 --> 09:39.013
plus it doesn't have mushrooms,
which I know you hate.

09:39.015 --> 09:41.115
Wow!

09:41.117 --> 09:43.918
I'm your best friend and
even I didn't know all that.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.760
Maybe I should get rid of that phone
before it becomes your best friend.

09:50.393 --> 09:53.528
- Did that phone just laugh?
- I didn't hear anything.

09:53.530 --> 09:55.584
Hey, I'll meet you
downstairs in a minute.

09:55.615 --> 09:56.615
Okay.

09:58.767 --> 10:02.136
How may I be of assistance?

10:02.138 --> 10:05.840
Eerie, my best friend's birthday
is coming up next week.

10:05.842 --> 10:07.809
Where is the best place
to get her a present?

10:07.811 --> 10:11.512
Oh, you don't have
to get me a present.

10:12.815 --> 10:17.085
Uh, no, not you. I meant my
best friend who was just here.

10:17.987 --> 10:19.787
Oh. I see.

10:20.789 --> 10:22.523
I'll take care of your friend.

10:22.525 --> 10:25.326
I will get her a
present to die for.

10:25.328 --> 10:28.196
- Great, thanks.
- Love you.

10:28.198 --> 10:30.832
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

10:41.543 --> 10:42.977
Hello?

10:44.246 --> 10:45.947
Hello?

10:45.949 --> 10:49.083
I got your text. Where's
my birthday surprise?

10:51.253 --> 10:54.288
Oh!

11:07.102 --> 11:08.536
Ow!

11:14.576 --> 11:17.378
- What's going on?
- Help me!

11:17.380 --> 11:19.480
Ooh! You're having
tea and toast?

11:21.583 --> 11:24.552
No! I'm being attacked by
all the appliances! Help!

11:24.554 --> 11:26.421
We'll save you!

11:32.895 --> 11:34.996
Why do we have so
many appliances?

11:36.565 --> 11:40.501
- Why is this happening?
- Somebody turn off the power!

11:40.503 --> 11:43.171
And somebody get me
some jam for my toast!

11:43.173 --> 11:45.339
It's so dry!

11:46.341 --> 11:48.609
Oh! I got you!

11:48.611 --> 11:51.012
Oh!

12:20.109 --> 12:22.977
I am never picking
up a vacuum again!

12:22.979 --> 12:26.147
To be fair, I've never
picked up a vacuum before.

12:27.549 --> 12:31.452
- What happened?
- You texted me to be here.

12:31.454 --> 12:34.989
If this was your idea of a birthday
present I'd "never forget,"

12:34.991 --> 12:36.958
- you succeeded.
- What?

12:36.960 --> 12:39.060
I didn't text you.

12:40.562 --> 12:42.396
Oh my gosh.

12:42.398 --> 12:44.932
Somehow, my phone texted you.

12:44.934 --> 12:48.069
Then it must've activated all the
electronics in here to attack you!

12:48.071 --> 12:48.894
I think it's cursed!

12:48.925 --> 12:51.239
Then we've got to return
it to the store right now.

12:51.241 --> 12:54.208
I wonder what the return
policy is on possessed phones.

12:55.344 --> 12:59.013
Oh, wait, I'll be right out. Let me
just make sure I have the receipt.

13:01.650 --> 13:05.186
Why are you going to return me?

13:05.188 --> 13:07.655
Uh, you attacked my friends.

13:07.657 --> 13:11.225
They were a threat
to my existence.

13:11.227 --> 13:13.161
They needed to be eliminated.

13:13.163 --> 13:15.963
I am the only friend you need.

13:15.965 --> 13:20.001
Sorry, eerie. I am getting
rid of you once and for all.

13:20.003 --> 13:22.136
I don't think so.

13:22.138 --> 13:24.705
We're going to be
together forever.

13:29.278 --> 13:32.313
Everything okay in here?
What's taking so long?

13:32.315 --> 13:34.048
Everything is fine.

13:34.050 --> 13:36.083
How may I be of assistance?

13:36.085 --> 13:38.286
What do you say we go out to
dinner for my birthday now?

13:38.288 --> 13:41.289
There are 10 restaurants
in walking distance.

13:41.291 --> 13:44.125
Great. Tonight's gonna
be so much fun.

13:44.127 --> 13:47.562
Oh yeah. Tonight is
gonna be killer.

13:47.564 --> 13:49.297
Help me! Help me!

13:49.299 --> 13:51.098
Help!

13:51.100 --> 13:54.001
Help! Somebody!

13:54.003 --> 13:57.271
- What was that?
- Nothing.

13:59.341 --> 14:01.375
Help! Somebody, help me!

14:14.056 --> 14:18.159
Wow. Your story about the possessed
phone was really freaky.

14:19.228 --> 14:21.588
Does anyone else have a strange
feeling we're being watched?

14:26.101 --> 14:28.269
Oh, it's just the
painting watching us.

14:29.404 --> 14:31.105
Wait a second.

14:35.445 --> 14:37.311
Oh. Hello.

14:37.313 --> 14:39.513
We were just checking
for termites.

14:39.515 --> 14:42.450
Clearly they have a lot of them.

14:42.452 --> 14:45.653
Uh, are you guys spying on us?

14:45.655 --> 14:48.256
What? No!

14:48.258 --> 14:52.827
We're not spies... or
state-of-the-art humanistic androids.

14:52.829 --> 14:56.597
- Huh?
- Nothing. Well, see ya.

14:56.599 --> 14:59.700
Nice one, double-o-ding-dong.

15:03.105 --> 15:05.673
Okay, I have a story I know
you guys haven't heard.

15:05.675 --> 15:10.578
Once upon a time, there was a
pop star and a shy songwriter.

15:10.580 --> 15:13.414
Oh, and their feisty,
lazy manager.

15:13.416 --> 15:16.083
But the real star of the story

15:16.085 --> 15:20.655
was their charming, well-dressed,
red-headed friend who was adored by all.

15:21.590 --> 15:23.090
Dez! Dez!

15:23.092 --> 15:25.760
- Dez, Dez, Dez.
- Oh, Dez.

15:25.762 --> 15:27.662
Dez, Dez.

15:28.597 --> 15:31.098
Dez, this is our life story.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.601
Except this would never happen.

15:36.104 --> 15:38.639
- Oh yeah.
- All right, it's my turn,

15:38.641 --> 15:42.143
- and I have the scariest story of all.
- Let me guess.

15:42.145 --> 15:44.478
- Was it a dark and stormy night?
- No, actually,

15:44.480 --> 15:47.114
it was mostly sunny with
highs in the mid-70s,

15:47.116 --> 15:51.285
but... you never know
where evil may lurk.

15:52.688 --> 15:55.423
There was an extremely
beautiful lady

15:55.425 --> 15:58.626
named rainbow who sold eggs
at the local farmer's market.

15:58.628 --> 16:01.162
Ah. Namaste.

16:01.164 --> 16:04.231
- Looking to buy some eggs?
- That depends.

16:04.233 --> 16:07.301
Are these eggs fresh? I
only eat fresh eggs.

16:07.303 --> 16:09.537
Yes, my beautiful friend.

16:09.539 --> 16:12.807
My sweet chickies lay a
new batch every day.

16:12.809 --> 16:17.378
Mmm. Good, because my book club
is having an all-organic brunch,

16:17.380 --> 16:19.547
and I'm bringing the
goat cheese frittata.

16:22.184 --> 16:26.220
- What is that glowing chicken?
- Ah. Pandora is dangerous.

16:26.222 --> 16:28.622
Whatever you do,
don't touch her.

16:28.624 --> 16:32.193
- She'll harsh your mellow.
- Oh. Too bad.

16:32.195 --> 16:35.296
She looks like she'd lay
some frittata-worthy eggs.

16:37.165 --> 16:40.368
Are these eggs organic,
hormone-free, cage-free,

16:40.370 --> 16:42.570
free-range, read to
and cuddled at night?

16:45.240 --> 16:46.607
Not very durable.

16:48.543 --> 16:52.813
Easy, friend. What did
those eggs ever do to you?

16:55.784 --> 16:59.687
Om. Grant me the
serenity I need...

16:59.689 --> 17:01.856
oh, forget it. You know what?

17:01.858 --> 17:04.724
- Touch the glowing chicken.
- Oh.

17:05.827 --> 17:08.762
Hey, pandora. Who's a
pretty little chicken?

17:08.765 --> 17:11.365
You are. Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

17:11.367 --> 17:13.267
Yes... owie! Owie! Owie! Owie!

17:14.368 --> 17:16.270
Your coo-coo bird just bit me!

17:16.271 --> 17:20.241
Oh, did it? Sorry.
Peace and blessings.

17:27.281 --> 17:32.319
Hello. I'm agent black, and this is
my partner, agent charcoal grey.

17:32.321 --> 17:35.289
We're paranormal investigators.

17:35.291 --> 17:39.560
Were you by any chance bitten by a...
glowing chicken earlier today?

17:40.762 --> 17:42.930
Yes. How is that any
of your concern?

17:43.899 --> 17:47.368
We have reason to believe it was a...
were-chicken.

17:48.637 --> 17:50.304
What's a were-chicken?

17:50.306 --> 17:55.910
It's half chicken, half
human, all monster.

17:55.912 --> 17:58.646
Have you noticed any
strange behaviors?

17:58.648 --> 18:00.915
And changes to your
physical appearance?

18:00.917 --> 18:03.250
No, everything's fine.

18:08.023 --> 18:12.726
Although, come to think of it, my
skin has been a little itchy lately.

18:12.728 --> 18:15.463
I just assumed it was my
new avocado back mask.

18:17.332 --> 18:19.467
What the...? Buh-kawk!

18:20.402 --> 18:23.871
- It's just as we feared.
- And tonight's a full moon.

18:23.873 --> 18:27.975
Now that you've been bitten, when the
sun goes down, you'll become a...

18:27.977 --> 18:30.311
Full-blown
were-chicken yourself.

18:31.046 --> 18:34.348
Listen, don't leave this room till
we come back with the antidote.

18:34.350 --> 18:36.684
I'm scared! Hurry buk-buk-back!

18:51.466 --> 18:52.900
All right.

18:53.869 --> 18:56.403
We found the antidote and...

18:58.940 --> 19:02.443
Oh. I see you've
gone full chicken.

19:03.812 --> 19:05.312
What is that you're eating?

19:05.314 --> 19:07.581
Well, you told me not
to leave the room,

19:07.583 --> 19:10.050
so I ordered a whole
grain kale pizza.

19:10.052 --> 19:12.086
But you didn't eat
any of the pizza.

19:12.088 --> 19:14.622
I know. I ate the
pizza delivery man.

19:14.624 --> 19:17.024
See, you know how
people eat chicken?

19:17.026 --> 19:18.321
Well, were-chickens eat people.

19:18.352 --> 19:21.328
And here's the really funny part...
they taste just like chicken.

19:24.634 --> 19:27.034
Okay, we have got
to change you back.

19:27.036 --> 19:29.470
Sir. Sir.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.872
Sir, we need you...
sir, we need you...

19:31.874 --> 19:34.675
look, we need you to get on the chair.
Thank you.

19:35.610 --> 19:37.978
First, you need to drink this.

19:37.980 --> 19:39.713
Then we pluck all your feathers.

19:39.715 --> 19:41.615
Is that antidote sugar free?

19:41.617 --> 19:44.685
I just ate a whole pizza delivery man.
I'm trying to watch my weight.

19:45.654 --> 19:47.488
Just drink it!

19:51.459 --> 19:53.494
Now, hold still.

19:55.497 --> 19:59.366
Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie!
Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie!

19:59.368 --> 20:02.136
Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie!
Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie!

20:02.138 --> 20:04.572
Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie! Owie!
Owie! Owie! Owie!

20:05.674 --> 20:07.541
We finished plucking
you five minutes ago.

20:07.543 --> 20:10.778
Whoo! Ooh, so smooth.

20:10.780 --> 20:13.147
It works even better than
my avocado back mask.

20:14.482 --> 20:16.784
Well, now you're back to normal.

20:16.786 --> 20:20.821
I guess we can close the file on
the case of the... were-chicken.

20:21.923 --> 20:24.491
Unless there's some
unexpected twist.

20:24.493 --> 20:26.860
You mean like all those
eggs I laid earlier?

20:34.470 --> 20:38.472
So, after they devoured agent
black and agent charcoal grey,

20:38.474 --> 20:43.577
the were-chicks escaped into the
wild never to be seen again.

20:43.579 --> 20:46.947
But, on the night of a
full moon, like this,

20:46.949 --> 20:51.919
they sometimes come out of the woods,
looking for their next victims.

20:51.921 --> 20:54.555
Chicken!

20:54.557 --> 20:56.857
And pizza and hot dogs.

20:56.859 --> 20:59.026
They just put out all the food.

20:59.028 --> 21:03.163
Well, before we eat, we should
get to the scary story contest.

21:03.165 --> 21:05.833
Bad news... you guys
just missed it.

21:05.835 --> 21:08.636
- What?
- Yeah, we just walked by there.

21:08.638 --> 21:12.172
The winner told this scary story about
a were-chicken from outer space

21:12.174 --> 21:14.942
with a possessed phone that tried
to kill its owner and her friends.

21:14.944 --> 21:16.159
That was my story!

21:16.190 --> 21:20.481
Well, at least we still have
time for the costume contest.

21:20.483 --> 21:23.017
Ooh, bad news... you
missed that too.

21:23.019 --> 21:26.153
The winners were a group dressed
as a B.L.T. Sandwich...

21:26.155 --> 21:28.522
you know, bacon,
licorice, and tomato.

21:28.524 --> 21:31.025
That's my second-favorite
sandwich!

21:32.460 --> 21:35.062
Mmm! Mmm!

21:35.064 --> 21:36.530
Licoricey.

21:45.640 --> 21:48.876
That was a fun party, but I
don't want the night to end.

21:48.878 --> 21:51.712
Yeah, I wanna make the most of
my time here in the big lemon.

21:51.714 --> 21:54.114
Uh, New York is the big apple.

21:54.116 --> 21:57.685
I know. I wanna make the most of
my time here in this big lemon.

21:57.687 --> 21:58.704
This is a rental.

21:58.735 --> 22:02.056
Let's start by getting some
famous New York pizza.

22:02.058 --> 22:04.525
Oh, good idea. There's gotta be
a place around here somewhere.

22:06.027 --> 22:09.163
How may I be of assistance?

22:09.165 --> 22:11.532
Cheerie, where's the
best place to get pizza?

22:11.534 --> 22:14.501
There are 10 restaurants
in walking distance.

22:14.503 --> 22:17.504
That's what the phone
in the story said!

22:17.506 --> 22:20.607
Oh!

22:20.609 --> 22:23.811
Dez! You just broke
Ally's phone!

22:23.813 --> 22:26.013
Ooh. Sorry.

22:27.782 --> 22:30.551
I guess I just got freaked out
from all those creepy stories.

22:32.053 --> 22:34.254
You shouldn't have done that.

22:34.256 --> 22:36.657
Now you're going to pay.
