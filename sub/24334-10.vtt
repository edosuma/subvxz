00:12.946 --> 00:14.948
*

00:50.918 --> 00:53.121
*

01:19.347 --> 01:21.315
SYD:
I'm going after him.

01:21.349 --> 01:24.352
(intro to Radiohead's
"True Love Waits" playing)

01:30.591 --> 01:35.663
* I'll drown my beliefs *

01:43.171 --> 01:45.973
I'm going after him.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.008
Maybe...

01:48.041 --> 01:50.444
he doesn't know...

01:51.712 --> 01:53.947
Go on.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.016
...the difference

01:56.049 --> 01:58.152
between things real
and not real,

01:58.186 --> 02:00.020
right and wrong.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.089
I'm going after him.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.258
He doesn't know
the difference...

02:04.292 --> 02:06.093
I'm going after him.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.562
He's a good... person.

02:09.797 --> 02:13.201
I'm going after him.

02:13.234 --> 02:16.136
CLARK:
Because of what I just said?

02:16.170 --> 02:18.606
Because love is
what we have to save

02:18.639 --> 02:21.074
if we're gonna save the world.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.814
I'm just not sure
that's what he's doing.

02:31.585 --> 02:34.188
* Don't leave. *

03:47.995 --> 03:49.363
Hey.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.031
It's okay.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.766
Don't be scared.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.236
Ah. There you go.

03:56.270 --> 03:58.038
There you go.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.141
There you go.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.142
Oh.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.761
Syd?

04:28.302 --> 04:30.103
Syd?

04:45.353 --> 04:46.520
Syd?

05:02.803 --> 05:04.638
Syd!

05:08.476 --> 05:10.478
(distant screaming
growing louder)

05:26.827 --> 05:28.829
*

05:46.279 --> 05:48.816
MELANIE:
Have you heard the one where...

05:48.849 --> 05:51.485
the definition of "crazy"
is doing the same thing

05:51.519 --> 05:54.154
over and over again and
expecting a different result?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.323
Where are we?

05:56.356 --> 05:59.159
You know what made me
think of that?

05:59.192 --> 06:01.161
Men.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.230
Are the others here?

06:03.263 --> 06:05.232
-Greatest threat

06:05.265 --> 06:08.669
to our gender

06:08.702 --> 06:10.904
since time began.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.140
-Yet here we are.

06:14.542 --> 06:17.377
Addicted to this delusion: love.

06:17.411 --> 06:20.247
We must be underground.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.249
I fell a long way.

06:22.282 --> 06:24.251
You're not listening.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.119
I get it.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.857
Oliver left and you're pissed.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.993
But that's not
what's happening to me.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.730
And honestly...

06:36.764 --> 06:39.399
I'm kind of sick
of talking about it.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.070
We need to get out of here.

06:53.447 --> 06:56.584
You know, the praying mantis
has the right idea.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.719
Fornicate, then eat their heads.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.120
I mean...

07:00.153 --> 07:02.723
really, what do we need men for?

07:02.756 --> 07:04.758
Well, except their sperm.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.760
Melanie... come on.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.128
Just...

07:08.161 --> 07:10.598
let me show you something.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.800
Here.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.171
:
Syd?

07:18.205 --> 07:20.073
SYD:
Is that...

07:20.107 --> 07:22.342
right now?

07:22.375 --> 07:24.444
Syd!

07:25.879 --> 07:28.048
MELANIE:
He doesn't love you.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.852
What did you say?

07:31.885 --> 07:34.187
Oh... oh, I mean,
I'm sure he loves you

07:34.221 --> 07:35.856
the way...

07:35.889 --> 07:38.091
a boy loves his mommy

07:38.125 --> 07:40.427
or a dog loves a bone,

07:40.460 --> 07:42.195
but, uh...

07:42.229 --> 07:44.765
what he really loves...

07:44.798 --> 07:47.701
what they all love...

07:47.735 --> 07:52.640
is that feeling of power knowing
you've been chosen by God.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.808
That you're special.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.844
That you have a destiny.

07:58.345 --> 08:01.515
No piece of ass
can ever compete with that.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.722
I'm in hell.

08:08.756 --> 08:11.091
-This is hell.
-Look.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.295
SYD:
Just promise me...

08:15.328 --> 08:18.699
if you get lost,
we get lost together.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.738
-How are you...
-You know, they say

08:24.772 --> 08:26.807
you can't convince someone
they're wrong

08:26.840 --> 08:28.976
simply by giving them the facts.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.845
But a good story
will do it every time.

08:31.879 --> 08:35.148
So I'm gonna tell you a story.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.350
Once upon a time

08:37.384 --> 08:39.352
-there was a little boy.

08:39.386 --> 08:40.988
A very special little boy.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.726
And he had a gift...

08:45.759 --> 08:47.995
and a curse.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.898
What do you think his curse was?

08:51.932 --> 08:53.400
Some...

08:53.433 --> 08:56.203
someone put a monster
in his head.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.605
No, silly.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.073
The monster was the gift.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.443
His curse was...

09:07.748 --> 09:10.017
...he's insane.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.290
That was...

09:17.324 --> 09:18.926
Was what?

09:18.959 --> 09:21.161
The devil on his shoulder?

09:26.266 --> 09:27.935
Sure.

09:27.968 --> 09:32.105
You can make someone do
what they don't want to do...

09:32.139 --> 09:35.776
but there's no force on Earth

09:35.809 --> 09:37.945
that makes you enjoy it.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.314
-There.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.216
You see it?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.619
His true face.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.322
The one he hides.

10:32.565 --> 10:36.403
OLIVER: * Would you like
to swing on a star *

10:37.838 --> 10:40.974
* Carry moonbeams home
in a jar *

10:42.409 --> 10:45.679
* And be better off
than you are *

10:47.180 --> 10:50.217
* Or would you
rather be a pig? *

10:50.250 --> 10:51.852
There you are.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.523
Chill, baby.
There's no boo-hoo here.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.591
I just thought
we could talk in private.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.395
Aah!

11:02.429 --> 11:05.232
Aah, the hair! The hair!

11:07.100 --> 11:09.236
Careful, daddy-o.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.972
Don't hurt the vessel--
it's not his fault.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.140
Shut up.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.808
I am done listening to you.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.643
Just tell me
what you did with Syd,

11:16.676 --> 11:18.545
and I promise,
I'll kill you quick.

11:18.578 --> 11:21.248
You're not making any sense.

11:21.281 --> 11:25.218
How can you kill me?
I'm part of you.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.689
Stop it!

11:32.559 --> 11:36.029
:
I know something you don't know.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.898
Where is she?

11:43.236 --> 11:45.372
Remember...

11:45.405 --> 11:47.607
you asked for it.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.960
You know what she told me?

12:06.994 --> 12:08.996
Syd?

12:11.664 --> 12:14.367
"Love won't save us.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.770
It's what we have to save."

12:19.272 --> 12:21.775
And you know what makes us
hard enough to do it?

12:24.511 --> 12:27.815
All the pain and the damage,

12:27.848 --> 12:29.917
everything you did to me.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.622
The scar tissue.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.290
All your nightmares,

12:37.324 --> 12:41.261
every symptom,
the lies you made me tell,

12:41.294 --> 12:42.830
the drugs I did.

12:42.863 --> 12:46.800
That's my armor, baby.

12:46.834 --> 12:50.503
I'm the lunatic
you turned me into.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.706
And I'm ready for my revenge.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.646
Tell me.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.949
Tell me where she is.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.394
Oh...

13:25.038 --> 13:26.473
Tell me.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.086
Tell me.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.026
MELANIE:
Look at him.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.495
-Your man.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.999
The things he'll do

13:52.032 --> 13:53.833
to a friend.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.869
DAVID:
Tell me.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.040
No.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.042
That's not...

14:04.544 --> 14:07.680
It's a trick.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.483
It's Farouk.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.719
You think that matters?

14:12.752 --> 14:15.422
The victim? Look at him.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.457
His true face.

14:20.593 --> 14:21.861
Now you tell me,

14:21.895 --> 14:25.032
who's the monster?

15:24.024 --> 15:26.026
(Lenny whistling
"Happy Birthday to You")

15:43.010 --> 15:45.012
Hey, what are we doing here?

16:27.420 --> 16:29.156
Hello.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.523
Excuse me.

17:03.556 --> 17:07.794
Um, do you know where a girl
could find a monastery?

17:10.763 --> 17:13.900
Cool.

17:13.933 --> 17:16.403
Thanks.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.738
(whistling
"Happy Birthday to You")

17:36.055 --> 17:38.024
DAVID:
Tell me.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.426
Tell me!

17:44.231 --> 17:45.598
-OLIVER: No!

17:47.167 --> 17:50.503
I'm gonna be sick.

17:58.611 --> 18:01.814
It doesn't bother you?

18:01.848 --> 18:04.584
Seeing him there like that?

18:06.453 --> 18:09.456
It's not him.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.824
My Oliver.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.860
That's just a mask.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.630
You don't seem like you.

18:17.664 --> 18:22.101
I've changed.
My eyes are clear now.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.637
There's something else
you should see.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.278
SYD:
How are you doing this?

18:33.946 --> 18:36.349
Showing me these things.

18:36.383 --> 18:40.420
You know about her, don't you?

18:40.453 --> 18:43.323
The other woman.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.958
The other you.

18:45.992 --> 18:49.962
In the future, the other me.
Yeah, I know.

18:53.366 --> 18:56.503
Do you know the things
David does with her?

18:59.138 --> 19:01.641
FUTURE SYD:
Could we say good

19:12.652 --> 19:14.687
He didn't tell you.

19:17.690 --> 19:21.894
It's not a big deal. It's me.

19:21.928 --> 19:25.532
Why would I...

19:25.565 --> 19:29.702
Why should I let that bother me?

19:29.736 --> 19:31.671
But it does.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.343
Did he tell you
what she asked him to do?

19:39.379 --> 19:42.682
Help Farouk find his body.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.884
Did he tell you why?

19:44.917 --> 19:47.854
No.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.390
He says he doesn't know.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.225
Do you believe him?

19:58.231 --> 20:00.199
Do you want to know?

20:15.047 --> 20:17.684
FUTURE SYD:
I need you

20:17.717 --> 20:19.919
to stop the world from ending.

20:21.654 --> 20:25.925
And who will end the world?

20:27.794 --> 20:29.929
Tiny humans with their bombs?

20:29.962 --> 20:32.432
World War III?

20:33.800 --> 20:36.336
No.

20:51.318 --> 20:52.919
No.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.763
Stop it.

21:08.801 --> 21:11.638
FAROUK:
For centuries, everyone said

21:11.671 --> 21:15.274
Amahl Farouk is the villain.

21:15.308 --> 21:18.110
And now you're telling me

21:18.144 --> 21:21.948
that the opposite is true.

21:21.981 --> 21:25.017
That the villain

21:25.051 --> 21:28.855
is a hero.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.323
And the hero...

21:30.357 --> 21:34.327
is the villain?

21:43.636 --> 21:46.973
-I don't understand.
-MELANIE: Yes, you do.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.075
You just don't want to admit it.

21:53.746 --> 21:57.149
You're saying...

21:57.183 --> 21:59.952
what, that he... David...

21:59.986 --> 22:03.556
The greatest monsters
are the ones in human clothes.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.861
-How...

22:08.895 --> 22:11.263
I don't know.

22:14.701 --> 22:17.336
All I know is he does,

22:17.370 --> 22:20.573
into something magnificent,

22:20.607 --> 22:22.675
something terrible.

22:22.709 --> 22:26.178
Legion,

22:26.212 --> 22:28.448
the world killer.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.861
You don't know that.
The future's not written.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.730
Oh, Sydney. Look at him.

22:46.899 --> 22:50.269
He has too much power.

22:50.302 --> 22:54.173
All his life he's been
tricked and abused.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.376
His head filled with voices.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.612
He's seen things,

22:59.646 --> 23:01.514
horrible things,

23:01.548 --> 23:05.284
things no child
should never see.

23:08.655 --> 23:13.626
So he lied and he stole
and he ruined everything.

23:13.660 --> 23:18.264
And he wore his madness
like a coat.

23:18.297 --> 23:19.999
And then he hanged himself...

23:21.834 --> 23:25.705
...because he saw
what he becomes.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.406
And then,

23:27.440 --> 23:31.343
when his life was truly over...

23:34.280 --> 23:38.885
...he spent five years

23:38.918 --> 23:41.320
in a mental hospital.

23:43.456 --> 23:47.393
He's a good...

23:47.426 --> 23:51.097
He's a good person.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.265
He's a psychopath.

23:53.299 --> 23:56.769
And do you want to know
how I know?

23:56.803 --> 23:59.572
Because the same man
who did this...

23:59.606 --> 24:02.141
SYD:
You promise?

24:02.174 --> 24:04.376
No secrets.

24:07.313 --> 24:11.250
No secrets.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.920
...did this...

24:18.324 --> 24:19.659
...and this...

24:19.692 --> 24:21.528
Hey, sexy.

24:29.536 --> 24:30.970
...and this.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.171
BRUBAKER:
Hey.

24:32.204 --> 24:33.806
He...

24:33.840 --> 24:35.808
wears...

24:37.176 --> 24:38.978
a...

24:39.011 --> 24:41.347
human...

24:41.380 --> 24:43.550
face.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.512
*

25:23.122 --> 25:25.457
It was here,
and now it's on the move.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.631
She's close.

25:35.101 --> 25:36.703
Find her.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.902
*

27:02.354 --> 27:04.456
(emitting high-pitched
frequency)

27:10.529 --> 27:11.931
Ah...

27:11.964 --> 27:13.966
(high-pitched frequency
continues)

27:46.198 --> 27:49.535
Ah... Ah.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.915
(intro to "Ocean Size"
by Jane's Addition playing)

28:02.949 --> 28:05.084
* Three, four *

28:05.117 --> 28:07.386
-*

28:16.528 --> 28:21.233
* Wish I was ocean size *

28:21.267 --> 28:23.002
* They cannot move you *

28:23.035 --> 28:26.572
* Man, no one tries *

28:26.605 --> 28:28.007
* No one pulls you *

28:28.040 --> 28:31.443
* Out from your hole *

28:31.477 --> 28:35.681
* Like a tooth aching
a jawbone *

28:35.714 --> 28:37.716
*

28:50.662 --> 28:53.132
Aah!

29:02.308 --> 29:04.676
* Oh! *

29:13.986 --> 29:16.789
*

29:34.440 --> 29:38.177
For the last time, where is she?

29:48.454 --> 29:51.357
She's with...

29:51.390 --> 29:54.226
Farouk.

30:02.168 --> 30:05.337
-What do you...
-I'm sorry.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.773
He made me.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.876
Where are they?

30:09.909 --> 30:12.544
Oliver, please.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.146
Is he in his body?

30:14.180 --> 30:16.482
Does he have her?

30:16.515 --> 30:18.684
Is she alive?

30:18.717 --> 30:20.786
Please!

30:20.819 --> 30:23.055
I have to know.

30:40.739 --> 30:43.175
It's not your fault.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.047
This is their power,

30:48.080 --> 30:50.849
the mind readers.

30:50.883 --> 30:53.719
They read our minds...

30:53.752 --> 30:56.923
and then they show us
what we want to see.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.191
We can't trust them.

31:00.559 --> 31:04.030
You have to trust yourself.

31:04.063 --> 31:08.067
The person you've become
in the future.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.869
You've seen what he becomes.

31:10.903 --> 31:13.372
Your man.

31:13.405 --> 31:17.376
But it doesn't...
have to happen.

31:18.911 --> 31:21.513
-We can...

31:21.547 --> 31:23.449
Change him?

31:25.617 --> 31:28.921
The man who beats his woman--
does he ever really change?

31:28.955 --> 31:31.357
A serial killer.

31:32.824 --> 31:35.827
The pathological liar.

31:38.430 --> 31:41.233
It's not a choice.

31:41.267 --> 31:44.536
It's who he is.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.973
And we have to stop him.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.178
*

33:04.383 --> 33:06.385
*

33:27.539 --> 33:29.741
We need the highest point,
facing east.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.711
And fast,
we're running out of time.

33:48.860 --> 33:49.928
Go, now.

33:49.961 --> 33:51.830
Kill the weak.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.766
-We'll be leaving soon.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.218
*

35:52.050 --> 35:53.652
You give up yet?

36:01.893 --> 36:04.663
-No!

36:09.735 --> 36:11.737
*

36:23.882 --> 36:25.917
Thanks.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.619
No problem.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.593
You should probably go get him.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.228
Are you gonna...?

36:36.262 --> 36:39.365
No, I'm supposed to wait here.

36:39.398 --> 36:42.200
For what?

36:42.234 --> 36:44.403
The big payback.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.476
*

37:15.401 --> 37:18.136
Hey, I can walk-- you
don't need to treat me like...

37:56.007 --> 37:59.945
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear...

38:01.780 --> 38:03.582
Oh... oh.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.017
It's-it's-it's...
it's on the ceiling.

38:06.051 --> 38:08.053
Oh...

38:33.912 --> 38:35.547
Oh, M-N.

38:35.581 --> 38:36.715
Magnesium.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.116
Flerovium. F-L.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.518
Magnesium...

38:47.893 --> 38:50.362
Ow.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.213
Oliver.

39:10.215 --> 39:12.117
DAVID:
He's not dead.

39:13.385 --> 39:15.787
He should be, but he's not.

39:17.255 --> 39:19.625
Wha... What happened?

39:20.692 --> 39:22.761
I tortured him.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.163
Farouk...

39:25.196 --> 39:26.898
Gone.

39:26.932 --> 39:29.935
In another body now,
maybe even his own.

39:29.968 --> 39:32.838
I got your message.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.841
The car, the gun--
they're here, with Lenny.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.844
But Clark's coming, too,
and he's bringing something.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.679
The Choke.

39:40.712 --> 39:43.582
It's a dampener.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.584
What does it dampen?

39:45.617 --> 39:47.118
Us.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.120
Our powers.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.957
Something to do with the...
frequency when you ring it.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.892
None of our powers work.

39:55.093 --> 39:58.363
-So you...
-When we ring that bell,

39:58.396 --> 40:00.932
we're all just men...

40:00.966 --> 40:03.401
for a few minutes.

40:05.303 --> 40:07.038
Well, I hate to...

40:07.072 --> 40:09.274
but there's a minotaur
in the maze,

40:09.307 --> 40:10.809
and it's hunting us.

40:10.842 --> 40:14.079
-So we should...
-He did this to me.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.247
The Shadow King.

40:17.282 --> 40:19.985
It's...

40:20.018 --> 40:22.954
You don't have to worry.

40:22.988 --> 40:25.156
I think Oliver's okay.

40:25.190 --> 40:28.293
DAVID:
That's not what worries me.

40:28.326 --> 40:32.297
See, I'm sitting here thinking
about how I'm gonna kill him.

40:32.330 --> 40:34.099
My parasite.

40:36.201 --> 40:39.037
All the different ways.

40:41.973 --> 40:45.276
And what worries me...

40:45.310 --> 40:47.613
is how good it feels.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.235
Cary?

41:14.039 --> 41:16.307
Cary?

41:43.869 --> 41:45.671
Found you.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.706
That's one for me.

41:49.207 --> 41:51.176
I have to stop him.

41:51.209 --> 41:52.578
Farouk?

41:52.611 --> 41:54.746
No. David.

41:59.184 --> 42:02.888
He's the monster now.

42:02.921 --> 42:05.757
Maybe he always was.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.767
I got this.

42:16.968 --> 42:18.737
No.

42:18.770 --> 42:21.206
I need to hit something.

42:21.239 --> 42:24.743
*

42:39.925 --> 42:40.926
Aah!

43:22.367 --> 43:23.802
Hola, friend.

43:23.835 --> 43:25.270
Can we help?

43:30.475 --> 43:32.177
VERMILLION 1:
Conflict imminent.

43:32.210 --> 43:35.580
Chance of victory:
zero percent.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.248
Retreat.

43:37.282 --> 43:39.617
Ah.

43:39.651 --> 43:41.853
He brought the Choke.

43:43.889 --> 43:45.891
My clever boy.

44:27.265 --> 44:30.568
DAVID:
To bed, to bed,

44:30.601 --> 44:32.804
the mother said.

44:32.838 --> 44:35.874
To bed, she said.

44:35.907 --> 44:37.876
The Angry Boy,

44:37.909 --> 44:39.911
his face turned red.

44:41.179 --> 44:44.149
His face turned red.

44:44.182 --> 44:46.885
And with a cry...

44:46.918 --> 44:50.789
he chopped her head.

44:57.562 --> 44:59.564
Boo.

46:56.647 --> 46:58.149
