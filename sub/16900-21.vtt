Previously on 30 Rock

00:04.713 --> 00:05.839
Oh, garlic. Not that.

00:06.006 --> 00:09.426
Sorry, I don't shake hands.
I have avian bone syndrome.

00:09.593 --> 00:10.636
Hollow bones.

00:10.802 --> 00:14.223
Tracy Jordan, the Black Crusaders
are coming for you.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.433
The top law firm in Cleveland wants me.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.018
God's sakes, Tracy, where are you?

00:18.185 --> 00:19.353
Starting a new life.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.813
Because of the Black Crusaders?
That's crazy.

00:21.987 --> 00:23.640
- Will you marry me?
- No.

00:23.814 --> 00:25.021
I took that job.

00:25.193 --> 00:25.818
Blurgh.

00:25.981 --> 00:28.159
Where was Kenneth?
Let's find out.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.441
Cough.

00:30.615 --> 00:33.112
And cough.

00:33.285 --> 00:35.610
And cough.

00:35.788 --> 00:39.120
Okay, now let's start the examination.

00:39.288 --> 00:41.413
- Are you getting enough sleep?
- No.

00:41.586 --> 00:43.410
- You drinking water?
- No.

00:43.586 --> 00:45.830
- Are u exercising at all?
- No.

00:46.006 --> 00:48.631
- And you're still working those long hours?
- Yes.

00:48.797 --> 00:49.842
I feel great.

00:50.006 --> 00:51.423
My wedding's in a couple of days.

00:51.596 --> 00:53.553
Your 18th, right?
Same as Bianca's.

00:53.726 --> 00:55.513
I guess our friends
will just have to choose between us.

00:55.685 --> 01:01.350
My mother's coming up from Florida
to attend Bianca's wedding, so it's perfect.

01:01.528 --> 01:03.140
Do you...

01:03.315 --> 01:07.443
have any questions about the wedding night?

01:07.606 --> 01:09.651
You know, you're actually
in better shape than last year.

01:09.828 --> 01:12.733
You lost a couple pounds,
your lab work is good,

01:12.908 --> 01:14.441
and your blood pressure is...

01:14.617 --> 01:18.240
310 over 280!
We have a winner.

01:18.416 --> 01:20.030
How's the stress eating?

01:20.208 --> 01:21.540
Under control.

01:21.708 --> 01:23.121
Still not eating right, huh?

01:23.297 --> 01:25.250
No, but I am eating a lot.

01:25.417 --> 01:28.543
You sound stressed.

01:28.885 --> 01:31.340
My boyfriend is moving to Cleveland.

01:31.505 --> 01:33.921
But I'm gonna go visit him
over vacation.

01:34.096 --> 01:35.511
And my boss is super-mad at me

01:35.676 --> 01:38.841
because I know that he fell asleep
on top of his fiancée.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.850
Have I given you my new book?

01:41.017 --> 01:42.932
It's about having
a satisfying love life.

01:43.105 --> 01:44.730
For life.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.442
Is that you in these pictures?

01:46.605 --> 01:49.521
My techniques guarantee male orgasm.

01:49.696 --> 01:52.523
And it's the season finale
of my show this week,

01:52.697 --> 01:54.822
and the star is missing,
and my have been abducted

01:54.996 --> 01:57.950
by a cabal of powerful black celebrities!

01:58.116 --> 02:00.743
That sounds stressful.

02:00.918 --> 02:04.122
Has anybody heard from Tracy at all?

02:04.298 --> 02:06.251
Grizz, Dotcom, anything?

02:06.415 --> 02:11.712
Well, I guess if he's not back by tomorrow morning,
we'll give some of his parts to Josh and...

02:11.888 --> 02:13.421
cut the rest.

02:13.595 --> 02:14.922
Can I play Barack Obama?

02:15.096 --> 02:17.722
No, it's bad enough
we have Tracy playing Barack Obama.

02:17.885 --> 02:20.011
I'm trying to get a head count
for the end-of-the-year party.

02:20.186 --> 02:22.513
Should I include Tracy and his guests,
or do you think he's dead?

02:22.687 --> 02:24.642
He's not dead, he's just...

02:24.817 --> 02:27.143
Lemon, could I speak with you a moment?

02:27.317 --> 02:29.142
I know you and I are not on good terms.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.812
But we do need to work together
to bring Tracy back here.

02:31.987 --> 02:33.652
Do you think I'm trying to not find Tracy?

02:33.826 --> 02:36.241
Well, Lemon, I cannot endure another failure.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.112
Jack, trust me.

02:37.288 --> 02:39.451
Nobody wants to do the show without Tracy.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.740
We used to do it every week without him.

02:41.918 --> 02:42.743
I'm just saying.

02:42.918 --> 02:44.413
Ugh! I hope he's okay.

02:44.588 --> 02:45.911
I hope he's taking his medication.

02:46.088 --> 02:51.960
And I hope he took a jacket,
'cause it can get real chilly there.

02:52.885 --> 02:56.340
I'm sorry, but I swore
I wouldn't tell anyone where Tracy is.

02:56.518 --> 02:59.422
Kenneth, my ex-girlfriend
is a member of the Black Crusaders.

02:59.597 --> 03:01.010
I can make all this go away.

03:01.185 --> 03:02.720
My lips are sealed.

03:02.895 --> 03:04.640
Key in pocket.

03:04.817 --> 03:06.641
- You are pissing off the wrong guy, Parcell.
- You turd-faced goon.

03:06.816 --> 03:08.731
- I will cut you open like a tauntaun...
- You tell me where he is....

03:08.895 --> 03:12.230
you mouth-breathing Appalachian!

03:12.406 --> 03:13.520
Fine.

03:13.696 --> 03:15.021
I will tell you.

03:15.198 --> 03:16.732
Right now.

03:16.908 --> 03:20.952
That you are never gonna find him.

Mr. Jordan!

03:49.106 --> 03:51.520
Mr. Jordan!

03:51.697 --> 03:53.943
Uh, I think you have me
confused with someone else.

03:54.107 --> 03:56.443
My name is Gordon Tremeshko.

03:56.618 --> 03:58.782
Oh.

03:59.788 --> 04:01.531
I'm Jesse Parcell.

04:01.707 --> 04:04.242
Kenny's cousin.

04:04.415 --> 04:07.740
Kenny should have given you the code word.

04:07.916 --> 04:08.740
What?

04:08.916 --> 04:10.330
That's it!

04:10.506 --> 04:12.041
Such a thrill to meet you.

04:12.216 --> 04:13.750
Hey, thanks for taking me in, Jesse.

04:13.928 --> 04:15.130
I won't be a burden.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.921
Now make me a smoothie
and let's go clubbing.

04:18.098 --> 04:21.723
Oh...we don't have dancin' or liquor here.

04:21.886 --> 04:25.341
But cousin Kenneth sent me all your movies.

04:25.515 --> 04:31.310
At night, I laugh so hard,
it really riles up the wolves, yeah!

04:31.488 --> 04:34.810
Oh, I loved Honky Grandma Be Trippin'!

04:34.988 --> 04:35.442
This--

04:35.608 --> 04:37.812
Check it, check it.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.113
Now, you boys sit down,

04:39.276 --> 04:42.440
so this honky grandma gonna
show you how to break dance!

04:42.615 --> 04:45.240
Then he went--ooh!

04:45.417 --> 04:46.533
Check it two times.

04:46.708 --> 04:51.411
It was so funny,
I nearly wet my other pair of underpants!

04:51.585 --> 04:52.831
Did you call Tracy's wife on the phone?

04:53.007 --> 04:56.832
Yeah, as far as she knew, he's been shooting
a vampire movie in Bucharest since February.

04:57.007 --> 04:59.341
Lemon, I'm getting married
in a couple of days,

04:59.505 --> 05:03.553
and I don't need any more stress
in my life right now.

05:03.728 --> 05:04.632
Jackie-kins!

05:04.808 --> 05:06.843
Colleen! I mean, Mom!

05:07.016 --> 05:09.430
Ohh! Never mind!

05:09.605 --> 05:11.720
Well, well, well, well, well.

05:11.897 --> 05:13.730
Ha ha, this must be the one.

05:13.898 --> 05:14.640
Huh?

05:14.818 --> 05:16.652
Phoebe. Welcome!

05:16.817 --> 05:17.523
- No, no, no.
- No, I--

05:17.695 --> 05:18.443
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

05:18.615 --> 05:20.440
Mother, mother... this is not Phoebe.

05:20.617 --> 05:23.240
No, no. This is not Phoebe?

05:23.408 --> 05:25.110
Well, why the hell not?

05:25.285 --> 05:27.032
I mean, she's perfect.

05:27.205 --> 05:29.410
Character, she got strength of character.

05:29.588 --> 05:30.833
And I'll tell you something else.

05:30.995 --> 05:35.122
She's got a good, solid, baby bucket.

05:35.297 --> 05:37.711
You are a sassy old broad, aren't you?

05:37.887 --> 05:38.713
Hello.

05:38.888 --> 05:40.133
Uh, mother, this is Phoebe.

05:40.296 --> 05:41.423
Phoebe, this is my mother.

05:41.598 --> 05:44.550
Hello, Mother Doneghy. I'm Phoebe.

05:44.728 --> 05:46.840
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

05:47.018 --> 05:49.931
I love your little hat.

05:50.108 --> 05:52.763
Oh, my God.

05:55.686 --> 05:57.940
Hmm.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.731
I'll get it.

05:59.907 --> 06:01.020
Hello?

06:01.195 --> 06:05.030
Rooster, this is the farmer.
Is the egg safe?

06:05.197 --> 06:07.110
The egg is in the nest.

06:07.286 --> 06:07.952
Good.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.030
But be careful.

06:09.304 --> 06:13.621
The badger and the bear
have been asking questions.

06:13.793 --> 06:15.258
I don't know who you're talking about.

06:15.411 --> 06:17.929
Listen, you don't have
to worry about Tracy, okay?

06:18.089 --> 06:21.631
He's with his biggest fan.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.051
Hillbilly.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.920
- Hayseed.
- Was that Kenneth?

06:25.096 --> 06:26.132
What's going on in New York?

06:26.307 --> 06:28.340
Did he go to Russell Simmons' birthday party?

06:28.515 --> 06:30.342
Were there girls there with butts?

06:30.515 --> 06:33.511
Mr. Jordan, you need to
forget about New York.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.722
You're not a movie star anymore.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.940
Your name's Gordon Tremeshko.

06:38.106 --> 06:42.152
You live in Needmore, Pennsylvania,
where we don't go out at night.

06:42.315 --> 06:44.111
'Cause of the wolves.

06:44.278 --> 06:46.652
Right.

06:48.995 --> 06:52.120
I nearly almost got through the whole season
without him going completely bonkers.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.741
But now, you know, he's just gone.

06:53.918 --> 06:56.332
And if he doesn't get back in time,
I'm gonna have to rewrite the whole show.

06:56.505 --> 07:01.121
Hey, I'm sorry, but can we talk
about something besides work?

07:01.298 --> 07:03.542
Um, okay.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.212
What's the weather like there?

07:05.385 --> 07:06.842
Um...

07:07.017 --> 07:08.920
it's actually in the mid-40s.

07:09.097 --> 07:12.221
Oh, really, 'cause it's--
it's low '40s here.

07:12.395 --> 07:13.850
Really?

07:14.015 --> 07:16.852
- Yeah.
- Wow.

07:19.488 --> 07:20.943
So what are you doing?

07:21.108 --> 07:22.811
I'm, uh...

07:22.987 --> 07:24.821
I'm waiting for the bus.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.321
So, uh...

07:26.487 --> 07:29.742
I should probably just focus--
focus on that, you know.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.241
- Oh, okay. Um, call me later?
- Ok, bye.

07:32.418 --> 07:36.081
No, I haven't found him yet.

07:37.297 --> 07:40.411
I have to go to dinner tonight
with my mother and Phoebe.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.920
And my mother has requested that you join us.

07:43.088 --> 07:44.331
She...likes you.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.042
Uhh! No way.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.552
She's not asking.

07:46.717 --> 07:47.551
She's telling.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.550
Please.

07:49.728 --> 07:51.432
And try to get her to like Phoebe.

07:51.595 --> 07:53.930
Just a little, okay?

07:54.097 --> 07:54.722
You owe me.

07:54.898 --> 07:57.223
Okay, fine. But I want a lobster.

07:57.395 --> 07:57.723
Okay.

07:57.896 --> 07:59.733
I want two lobsters!

07:59.898 --> 08:04.022
Totaling five pounds of lobster meat.

08:04.195 --> 08:07.151
And then after that, we can clean
the dead birds out of the chimney.

08:07.326 --> 08:09.320
That's why we bought these metal rods.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.323
Don't you just love spring?

08:11.498 --> 08:13.532
Baltimore was amazing.

08:13.707 --> 08:16.533
You know Wacky Willy,
that DJ from 102.7?

08:16.705 --> 08:18.833
We totally did it in the prize van.

08:18.996 --> 08:22.410
I'll pretty much do anything
to someone that's famous.

08:22.587 --> 08:24.630
What's up?

08:24.796 --> 08:26.423
What are you looking at?

08:26.597 --> 08:28.630
I'll tell you what you're looking at.

08:28.807 --> 08:31.172
I'm...

08:32.015 --> 08:35.011
Gordon Tremeshko.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.511
I always thought it would be lovely
to get married in the spring.

08:38.688 --> 08:40.720
Just as the petunias start to bloom.

08:40.897 --> 08:42.432
Sorry, Phoebe, what?

08:42.606 --> 08:44.941
I always wanted to marry in the spring.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.732
Just as the petunias bloom.

08:46.906 --> 08:48.651
Just when the what?

08:48.828 --> 08:50.111
Oh, dear. Is she hard of hearing?

08:50.287 --> 08:51.533
No, no, no, no!

08:51.697 --> 08:53.112
I can hear you.

08:53.287 --> 08:55.951
I just wanted to make sure
you could hear you.

08:56.116 --> 08:58.031
Right.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.333
I'm off to the loo.

08:59.495 --> 09:02.830
Loo! What a good idea.

09:06.507 --> 09:07.422
All right.

09:07.587 --> 09:08.420
Scout's honor.

09:08.598 --> 09:12.091
What do you think of her?

09:12.718 --> 09:14.342
She's very well-read.

09:14.515 --> 09:17.140
And she's very stylish,
don't you think?

09:17.307 --> 09:20.930
And, you know, the most important thing
is she makes Jack very happy.

09:21.107 --> 09:24.733
She's like a...white geisha.

09:24.895 --> 09:26.813
A white geisha?

09:26.986 --> 09:30.402
Say no more, shark eyes.

09:30.698 --> 09:32.231
Jack...

09:32.406 --> 09:33.943
I want you to face facts.

09:34.117 --> 09:34.953
All right?

09:35.115 --> 09:36.952
She is not the right girl for you.

09:37.117 --> 09:38.821
You got it wrong with "Bianka."

09:38.995 --> 09:40.120
You remember?

09:40.288 --> 09:43.541
And now you're getting
it wrong with what's-her-name.

09:43.706 --> 09:45.622
Well, you oughta know, Colleen.

09:45.795 --> 09:48.711
The only marriage in the history
of St. Helen's Catholic Church

09:48.887 --> 09:51.343
where the priest recommended the divorce!

09:51.505 --> 09:53.340
And it's not "Bi-anka," like Sanka.

09:53.515 --> 09:57.842
It's "Bi-ahnca," like Willy Won--Wonka.

09:59.015 --> 10:02.100
Are you all right?

10:05.986 --> 10:09.353
Could we order dessert?

10:11.485 --> 10:12.443
Studio 6-H.

10:12.617 --> 10:14.532
Kenneth! You have to come get me!

10:14.696 --> 10:16.032
Really?

10:16.305 --> 10:17.533
But what about the Black Crusaders?

10:17.707 --> 10:19.530
I don't care what they do to me anymore.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.531
I'd rather die famous
than to live for 100 years like this.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.040
Licking pinecones, carrying plastic bags.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.750
Brushing my own teeth. This is unsuitable!

10:27.927 --> 10:31.210
Mr. Jordan, if you're serious,
then we've got less than 24 hours.

10:31.388 --> 10:32.710
The show needs you.

10:32.885 --> 10:34.132
What are ya doin'?

10:34.308 --> 10:35.713
Hey, dude! Jesse!

10:35.887 --> 10:39.842
Hey, listen,
I gotta get out of here because...

10:40.018 --> 10:41.430
You're not goin' anywhere.

10:41.605 --> 10:44.010
And that phone is for local calls only!

10:44.187 --> 10:46.430
Aah!

10:47.106 --> 10:49.483
Hello?

10:50.485 --> 10:54.530
Did you have a chance to look at
those silk samples I brought you?

10:54.697 --> 10:55.323
No.

10:55.485 --> 10:58.321
Jack, you desperately need new pajamas.

10:58.496 --> 11:00.032
They do such beautiful things.

11:00.205 --> 11:03.530
It's like wearing your own skin to bed.

11:03.707 --> 11:05.242
That sounds wonderful.

11:05.417 --> 11:07.332
Have you ever thought about
a fair finish for that ceiling?

11:07.507 --> 11:08.833
Shh.

11:09.007 --> 11:12.083
Careful, my bones!

11:13.715 --> 11:15.051
You all right?

11:15.218 --> 11:19.421
Well, with your condition,
ordinarily, wouldn't you just be on top?

11:19.595 --> 11:21.342
I can't.

11:21.517 --> 11:24.430
I have vertigo.

11:24.818 --> 11:28.231
It's a bloody shame nobody waits
for their wedding night anymore!

11:28.396 --> 11:29.232
Go to bed, Mother!

11:29.397 --> 11:32.652
You promised you'd go over my taxes!

11:32.817 --> 11:35.521
Oh, God's sake.

11:35.698 --> 11:38.441
Here it comes. The big one.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.742
Ride it, Donaghy.

11:40.907 --> 11:44.120
Ride it straight to hell!

11:44.287 --> 11:46.833
Bollocks.

11:47.795 --> 11:48.831
You still at work, ha?

11:49.005 --> 11:49.831
Yeah, of course.

11:50.008 --> 11:51.543
Tracy's gone. I'm still at work.

11:51.717 --> 11:53.213
It's a nightmare.

11:53.385 --> 11:55.632
Ugh! Is that how far apart my eyes are?

11:55.797 --> 11:58.712
I look like Admiral Akbar.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.051
Relax.

12:00.227 --> 12:01.512
It's one of the reasons I like you.

12:01.688 --> 12:04.342
So listen, I was going
to fly out there on Saturday.

12:04.518 --> 12:06.721
But I've got a bunch of stuff
to take care of.

12:06.895 --> 12:10.732
So now I'm gonna fly out there.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.812
I'm gonna come out there next Wednesday.

12:12.987 --> 12:17.072
Oh, wh-what's this thing doing now?

12:17.698 --> 12:19.323
What? Uh-oh.

12:19.485 --> 12:21.243
Yeah, Liz--working.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.450
Breaking up.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.243
Did you say we're breaking up?

12:24.416 --> 12:25.621
Yeah.

12:25.785 --> 12:27.912
What?

12:28.088 --> 12:29.410
Who is this? It's 3:00 in the morning.

12:29.585 --> 12:31.910
- Hello?
- Liz... Wait.

12:32.087 --> 12:33.333
What? Oh, my God.

12:33.507 --> 12:34.333
Are you breaking up with me?

12:34.506 --> 12:37.422
- What hospital?
- Wait, whoa, Liz...

12:37.595 --> 12:37.921
No, no, no.

12:38.096 --> 12:39.211
There has to be some
sort of misunderstanding.

12:39.386 --> 12:40.343
I'm his fiancée.

12:40.516 --> 12:43.632
I'm sorry, you're not family,
and you're not his emergency contact.

12:43.805 --> 12:44.223
Oh!

12:44.387 --> 12:46.512
Now, his mother can go in if she wants to.

12:46.686 --> 12:48.722
Oh, no! I'm not going in there.

12:48.897 --> 12:53.313
I go in there, I get bird flu,
I don't come out.

12:53.486 --> 12:54.730
Hi, I'm Liz Lemon.

12:54.905 --> 12:55.942
Somebody called me.

12:56.107 --> 13:00.033
Oh, yes, Mr. Donaghy designated you
as his emergency contact.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.111
What?

13:01.286 --> 13:03.613
Ladies!

13:03.788 --> 13:05.030
What? This?

13:05.208 --> 13:06.111
No, no.

13:06.288 --> 13:08.412
I was at a costume party
earlier this evening.

13:08.586 --> 13:12.121
And the hostess's dog attacked me,
so I had to stab it.

13:12.296 --> 13:12.751
Oh!

13:12.917 --> 13:14.330
Jack's going to be fine.

13:14.506 --> 13:17.423
But he has had a pretty
serious cardiac episode.

13:17.586 --> 13:22.552
Also, I suspect he may have scurvy,
because he keeps asking for lemon.

13:22.717 --> 13:25.131
Uh, no... that's me.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.433
Oh!

13:26.607 --> 13:28.352
Tell him his mother's here!

13:28.518 --> 13:30.431
And she loves him.

13:30.607 --> 13:33.983
But not in a queer way.

13:35.987 --> 13:37.310
Lemon, is that you?

13:37.485 --> 13:38.942
Yeah, it's me.

13:39.117 --> 13:40.520
How are you feeling?

13:40.695 --> 13:42.732
They gave me something.

13:42.907 --> 13:45.611
My mouth tastes like purple.

13:45.785 --> 13:46.822
Okay.

13:46.998 --> 13:49.622
I saw it, Lemon.

13:49.786 --> 13:53.542
My whole life passing right before my eyes.

13:53.708 --> 13:57.543
Neil Patterson pitching me
the rotating microwave tray.

13:57.718 --> 14:02.961
Me personally coining the phrase,
"What's the upside?"

14:03.215 --> 14:06.840
Participating in Hands Across America.

14:07.017 --> 14:12.892
And all the time I've been on this earth,
I have only one regret.

14:15.317 --> 14:17.522
I should have worked more.

14:17.697 --> 14:20.812
That's what you're taking away
from this experience?

14:20.986 --> 14:23.230
Work is the only thing I'm good at.

14:23.407 --> 14:25.531
Lemon, you and I have that in common.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.111
No, Jack, that's not true.

14:27.286 --> 14:30.450
I've been rolling calls from here.

14:30.625 --> 14:32.122
Trying to spin this Tracy thing.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.833
No, Jack, forget about Tracy.

14:33.995 --> 14:35.042
You have to relax.

14:35.206 --> 14:36.333
No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:36.505 --> 14:37.541
You've got to get back to work

14:37.715 --> 14:40.333
and come up with something
with or without Tracy,

14:40.508 --> 14:42.543
or we are gonna be screwed.

14:42.717 --> 14:44.712
Okay.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.553
Maybe this is the drugs talking...

14:47.726 --> 14:50.223
but I think I got Nixon...

14:50.398 --> 14:51.932
to agree to come on the show

14:52.108 --> 14:55.023
and say, "Sock it to me."

14:55.188 --> 14:55.931
Great.

14:56.108 --> 14:59.311
How's the Dow doing?

15:02.196 --> 15:03.150
You'll like my cousin Jesse.

15:03.325 --> 15:04.941
He's real sweet.

15:05.116 --> 15:08.742
Ooh, they got a door!
That's new.

15:08.907 --> 15:10.742
Hello there, cousin.

15:10.918 --> 15:13.123
What brings you to Parcell Hollow?

15:13.288 --> 15:15.242
Well, I'm here to pick up Tracy, of course.

15:15.417 --> 15:17.332
Well, that's peculiar.

15:17.507 --> 15:20.331
Why, he just left first thing this morning.

15:20.506 --> 15:21.541
(Kenny) Oh.

15:21.718 --> 15:23.711
Oh, I must have misunderstood him.

15:23.887 --> 15:26.460
Must have.

15:27.016 --> 15:30.340
Sorry you came all this way for nothin'.

15:30.518 --> 15:36.722
I'd invite you in, but I got a living
room full of dead chimney birds.

15:40.486 --> 15:41.233
Agh!

15:41.408 --> 15:43.941
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

15:44.118 --> 15:46.232
We must rest, my chimney bird.

15:46.405 --> 15:50.610
Tonight, we're reading my screenplay.

15:53.625 --> 15:56.332
I just timed the show, and without Tracy,
we're still 20 minutes short.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.832
Liz, on the show,

15:58.005 --> 16:01.623
I could do the thing
where I walk like Robocop.

16:01.798 --> 16:03.423
Zzz! Zzz! Your move, creep.

16:03.588 --> 16:06.130
That's great, that's completely topical.

16:06.305 --> 16:06.923
Ooh, hey, Cerie.

16:07.097 --> 16:10.053
Would you like to dance in front of
the band on TV tonight?

16:10.225 --> 16:11.130
For, like, ten minutes.

16:11.307 --> 16:11.932
What band?

16:12.098 --> 16:12.933
Our house band.

16:13.096 --> 16:15.012
No, thanks. Uh, Floyd called.

16:15.186 --> 16:16.013
Ugh.

16:16.186 --> 16:16.642
How's that going?

16:16.818 --> 16:17.350
Not great.

16:17.516 --> 16:20.811
We had a web chat last night, and I thought
he said he wanted to break up with me.

16:20.987 --> 16:21.940
Oh, that must have freaked you out.

16:22.108 --> 16:23.522
Actually, I was kind of relieved.

16:23.696 --> 16:24.442
Hey, guys.

16:24.615 --> 16:26.440
I hear you're looking for someone
to dance in front of the band.

16:26.618 --> 16:29.033
- Uh...no.
- Uh...no.

16:29.197 --> 16:29.740
Oh. Isn't this exciting?

16:29.907 --> 16:30.942
Everyone pulling together.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.240
I think the show's gonna
be really good this week.

16:33.417 --> 16:36.783
Oh, I hope Tray's okay.

16:42.006 --> 16:44.672
Ohh, Floyd.

16:46.087 --> 16:49.130
Tracy! Time for lunch.

16:49.305 --> 16:53.092
I hope you like chicken neck--

16:53.306 --> 16:55.010
Tracy has escaped.

16:55.186 --> 16:56.720
Thanks, Kenny, for saving me!

16:56.898 --> 17:00.020
I'll have you in New York
in time for your traditional pre-show rant!

17:00.185 --> 17:04.560
I think it's gonna be about immigration!

17:07.487 --> 17:09.150
By the hammer of Thor!

17:09.325 --> 17:10.611
(Tracy) Now go! Go, go, go!

17:10.786 --> 17:11.940
I'm gonna find you!

17:12.117 --> 17:14.530
I know what you look--
I remember what you look like!

17:14.708 --> 17:15.531
You're so stupid!

17:15.707 --> 17:18.832
I gotta reload!
Damn, I wish I had a vehicle!

17:18.998 --> 17:22.829
Jack, I'm filling out all-new paperwork
to make me your emergency contact.

17:23.007 --> 17:25.423
Of course, Phoebe. You should.

17:25.588 --> 17:28.040
I mean, it's just so embarrassing.

17:28.217 --> 17:29.632
Mr. Donaghy.

17:29.805 --> 17:30.630
You want dessert?

17:30.806 --> 17:33.632
Good God, yes.

17:39.518 --> 17:42.430
Uh, let me ask you a few questions, Jack.

17:42.605 --> 17:44.312
You dye your hair?

17:44.488 --> 17:48.401
No, Mother.
Why would I do that?

17:50.827 --> 17:52.821
Okay. What's your middle name?

17:52.997 --> 17:54.533
What? Just your middle name!

17:54.705 --> 17:57.161
Francis.

17:58.126 --> 18:02.742
Did you take $20 out of my pocketbook
in the summer of 1970?

18:02.916 --> 18:04.040
No, I did not!

18:04.206 --> 18:05.543
Do you love me?

18:05.716 --> 18:08.630
Of course I do!

18:11.096 --> 18:12.713
I knew it.

18:12.888 --> 18:15.802
Do you love me?

18:17.686 --> 18:19.010
I see.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.430
God!

18:21.817 --> 18:23.720
They got pretzels downstairs!

18:23.898 --> 18:26.141
Ohh!

18:27.395 --> 18:29.023
We're so close, and yet so far.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.650
Come on!

18:32.326 --> 18:35.820
Hey, do you guys know
what's causing the traffic problem?

18:35.996 --> 18:38.450
Yeah, the president's in town.
There's a transit strike.

18:38.615 --> 18:40.243
There's the Dominican Independence Day parade.

18:40.418 --> 18:42.910
A guy in suspenders is doing
chalk paintings down on Canal Street.

18:43.085 --> 18:45.123
You know how long it's gonna
take for me to get to Midtown?

18:45.298 --> 18:47.041
Without sirens? Hours.

18:47.215 --> 18:48.623
Hey, I need you to take me.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.540
Let me explain ambulances to you, sir.

18:50.717 --> 18:53.633
Uh, we don't go anywhere
unless someone is badly hurt, okay?

18:53.806 --> 18:55.133
But I'm gonna miss the show!

18:55.307 --> 18:57.550
Mr. Jordan...

18:57.728 --> 19:00.971
No, sir, you are not.

19:01.605 --> 19:04.810
Ken, you are my boy!

19:07.395 --> 19:10.150
Oh, my God, what a terrible mistake accident!

19:10.315 --> 19:11.733
Could you take Sixth Avenue, please?

19:11.908 --> 19:15.112
If I die, will you take care of my birds?

19:15.285 --> 19:17.240
I got a lot on my plate right now, Ken.

19:17.405 --> 19:19.741
Ohh, Tweetie.

19:19.915 --> 19:22.123
Okay, I know this has been
a really tough couple of days.

19:22.285 --> 19:26.411
But everyone has pulled together,
and I am so proud and so pumped.

19:26.585 --> 19:31.332
Because I honestly think that this might be
the best show we have ever done.

19:31.506 --> 19:32.543
I'm back!

19:32.717 --> 19:34.342
Oh, thank God.
We were so screwed!

19:34.505 --> 19:36.133
Tracy, you're alive.

19:36.308 --> 19:36.923
Okay, Robocop out!

19:37.095 --> 19:38.720
Cowboy Hey Hey back in!

19:38.888 --> 19:41.932
Liz Lemon, I would like
to recommend Kenneth the page

19:42.098 --> 19:43.640
for NBC Medal of Excellence.

19:43.806 --> 19:44.641
Okay, that doesn't exist.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.011
But you can write a letter for his file.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.930
I got a lot on my plate!

19:48.107 --> 19:49.233
Fine, but...

19:49.396 --> 19:50.311
Les, don't just stand there.

19:50.487 --> 19:51.943
Go...eat something!

19:52.108 --> 19:54.152
Wait...I don't know what this is.

19:54.316 --> 19:54.943
Oh, don't worry about it.

19:55.118 --> 19:56.822
Just read the cards
and act super-gay!

19:56.987 --> 19:58.111
Okay.

19:58.285 --> 20:01.032
Take this, Black Crusaders!

20:01.208 --> 20:04.411
It's Cowboy Hey Hey!

20:06.588 --> 20:07.912
This is 21.

20:08.086 --> 20:10.662
I'm on it.

20:19.596 --> 20:20.840
Good night! That's our show!

20:21.017 --> 20:22.633
Have a great summer, everybody!

20:22.807 --> 20:25.103
Mwah!

20:26.606 --> 20:29.352
So I'm your emergency contact, huh?

20:29.525 --> 20:35.652
You're the only person I know
who wouldn't hesitate to pull the plug.

20:37.697 --> 20:41.322
So when you going to Cleveland?

20:41.495 --> 20:44.322
I'm not going.

20:44.706 --> 20:47.831
Are you getting married in two days?

20:47.997 --> 20:51.662
Oh, Phoebe is a lovely girl.

20:52.508 --> 20:55.041
But...no.

20:56.598 --> 20:59.052
I'm not getting married.

20:59.215 --> 21:00.841
So what'd you think of the show?

21:01.015 --> 21:03.133
Honestly?

21:03.308 --> 21:05.933
I no longer think
you're doing a terrible job.

21:06.097 --> 21:09.973
And, uh, I'm very proud of you.

21:10.526 --> 21:13.312
Thanks, Jack.

21:13.487 --> 21:15.023
I'm gonna pull the plug now.

21:15.196 --> 21:16.022
Whoa, whoa.

21:16.195 --> 21:19.271
Just let me do it!
