WEBVTT

00:02.037 --> 00:03.939
I have big news,
everybody.

00:03.973 --> 00:07.309
Anything about Alien Language
League is neither big nor news,

00:07.343 --> 00:09.177
so why don't we just
start over and say,

00:09.211 --> 00:12.681
"Hey, everybody, I have
something really boring to say."

00:15.651 --> 00:17.752
As part of my quest
to experience

00:17.787 --> 00:19.955
everything possible
during my senior year...

00:19.989 --> 00:21.589
Max, hit the little
"record" button there...

00:22.892 --> 00:25.627
I have joined
the basketball team.

00:25.661 --> 00:27.529
Big news, not boring!

00:29.298 --> 00:31.766
He is the first member of
the Alien Language League

00:31.801 --> 00:33.969
to ever make
an organized sports team.

00:34.003 --> 00:36.371
Try and make fun of that!

00:36.405 --> 00:38.173
You just did.

00:40.109 --> 00:42.377
If you want that thing to pop,
stay where the money is.

00:44.046 --> 00:46.114
- Max, come on!
- What? Oh.

00:47.516 --> 00:50.318
Honey, are you sure
you made the team?

00:50.353 --> 00:52.520
Yeah. Um, what did
the coach say?

00:52.555 --> 00:56.524
'Cause sometimes "thank you"
really means "you can go now."

00:56.559 --> 00:58.126
Yeah, I made the team.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.596
- They only cut one guy.
- But I'm cool with it.

01:03.532 --> 01:05.433
They want to keep me
on the yell squad

01:05.468 --> 01:08.203
where I can make a larger
contribution to team morale.

01:08.237 --> 01:10.271
Coach's words,
not mine.

01:11.774 --> 01:13.608
Alex, you're
a cheerleader now.

01:13.642 --> 01:15.677
We should come up
with a cheer for Justin.

01:15.711 --> 01:17.312
Oh, my gosh, yes!
Let's go. Yeah!

01:18.481 --> 01:20.415
- Give me an "R"!
- R!

01:20.449 --> 01:22.150
- Give me a "U"!
- U!

01:22.184 --> 01:23.518
Oh, she's gonna spell "Russo"!

01:23.552 --> 01:24.853
Give me a...
"Kidding me?!"

01:24.887 --> 01:27.422
- Kidding me!
- Hey!

01:27.456 --> 01:29.324
Don't worry, Justin.
First awesome moment

01:29.358 --> 01:33.428
of your senior year video
has been... recorded.

01:33.462 --> 01:36.564
That's it. We're hiring someone
else to play her in the video.

02:40.663 --> 02:43.798
One cent, two cents,
three cents, a dollar!

02:43.833 --> 02:48.203
- All for the Turkeys...
- Stand up and wobble!

02:50.072 --> 02:52.040
Did Alex just say "wobble"?

02:52.074 --> 02:54.209
- Let's do it.
- OK.

02:55.678 --> 02:58.413
- We're wobbling!
- Whoa-ho-ho! Hey!

02:59.615 --> 03:01.516
It's not "wobble",
it's "gobble".

03:01.550 --> 03:04.285
Ooh, makin' fun
of the mascot. Not cool.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.688
You're right.
We're ashamed.

03:06.722 --> 03:09.390
But we didn't know. I mean,
this is our first game. Our...

03:12.895 --> 03:14.195
Ready? OK!

03:14.230 --> 03:16.931
Come on, crowd!
Yell real loud!

03:16.966 --> 03:19.601
- Let's go Turkeys!
- Let's eat turkeys!

03:19.635 --> 03:21.603
See what I did there?

03:21.637 --> 03:24.205
I was supposed
to say, "Go Turkeys"

03:24.240 --> 03:25.540
but I said "eat."

03:27.276 --> 03:30.945
That's just great. I gave
a megaphone to a mega-mouth!

03:33.015 --> 03:35.683
Ms. Russo, the role
of the cheerleader,

03:35.718 --> 03:37.886
much like that
of the rodeo clown,

03:37.920 --> 03:41.856
is to keep the crowd engaged during
dangerous, dangerous activities,

03:41.891 --> 03:43.458
not to mock them.

03:43.492 --> 03:45.827
Oh, no, Mr. Laritate,
I'm not mocking the crowd.

03:45.861 --> 03:47.629
No, I'm mocking the team.

03:49.165 --> 03:51.833
Where do you get the idea
that all of this is funny?

03:55.538 --> 03:58.206
So, who are you taking
to the homecoming dance?

03:58.240 --> 04:01.042
My TV. Guess what
I'm wearing? My couch.

04:03.712 --> 04:05.747
Alex, all the cheerleaders
are required to go.

04:05.781 --> 04:08.049
It's all we've been
talking about at practice.

04:08.083 --> 04:10.718
That, and how on Earth
you made the squad.

04:10.753 --> 04:12.820
Gobble, gobble, gobble!

04:15.324 --> 04:18.392
Well, if I have to go,
I mean, how about George?

04:18.427 --> 04:19.994
He's kinda cute.

04:20.029 --> 04:22.096
You like the conductor
of the pep band?

04:22.130 --> 04:24.666
Score, score!
We want more!

04:24.700 --> 04:26.401
He's the conductor?

04:26.435 --> 04:29.204
I thought he was just pointing
at people and making fun of them.

04:29.238 --> 04:31.739
"You have no talent.
You look ridiculous."

04:33.275 --> 04:34.676
Ah, well,
he's still cute.

04:34.710 --> 04:35.977
Hi, George!

04:38.847 --> 04:41.216
Hi...
Hi, Mom, Dad.

04:44.687 --> 04:46.821
Waving at your parents?
Good cover.

04:46.855 --> 04:49.023
You know what also helps
if people are ignoring you?

04:49.058 --> 04:51.426
Just a generic thumbs-up
and a salute.

04:53.229 --> 04:55.897
He's not ignoring me,
he's playing games.

04:55.931 --> 04:56.998
Game over.

04:58.434 --> 05:01.736
Dribble it, pass it!
We want a basket!

05:01.770 --> 05:05.440
Hey, Mom, Dad, I have another
really funny cheer for you guys.

05:05.474 --> 05:08.176
Listen, we're making it look
like we're reprimanding you,

05:08.210 --> 05:09.711
for the sake
of the other parents...

05:09.745 --> 05:12.046
- But we really love your cheers.
- Yeah.

05:13.782 --> 05:18.319
Well, I wonder if anyone else
would like to hear it.

05:18.354 --> 05:21.723
Oh, hey, you, you might
get a kick out of this.

05:21.757 --> 05:23.024
Ready?

05:23.058 --> 05:25.994
Dribble it, pass it,
We want a casket.

05:29.031 --> 05:31.633
- What'd you think?
- I'm sorry, I'm a little busy here.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.334
Oh, yeah, no, me too,
I'm cheerleading.

05:33.369 --> 05:35.903
I'm Alex Russo. You
probably know me, I'm your...

05:41.677 --> 05:44.379
Honey, it's not personal.
He does it to everyone.

05:50.085 --> 05:52.320
Here you go, guys. Nice pick,
nice pick. Way to roll.

05:52.354 --> 05:56.124
Good screen setting and way to play the
perimeter, guys. The perimeter's key.

05:57.993 --> 05:59.727
Did you get that?

05:59.762 --> 06:01.396
What? Did I get what?

06:03.332 --> 06:05.266
I handed water
to our leading scorer.

06:06.735 --> 06:07.935
I saw that!

06:07.970 --> 06:10.338
Great assist, Justin,
great assist.

06:14.743 --> 06:16.678
I don't understand
this game.

06:25.821 --> 06:29.624
Max, this video is boring. All
you got is me sitting on the bench.

06:29.658 --> 06:31.359
That's all you did, Justin.

06:32.961 --> 06:34.295
Don't worry, honey, listen,

06:34.330 --> 06:36.698
you did a great job
at the end of the bench.

06:36.732 --> 06:39.967
That's how we knew where the team
stopped and the audience started.

06:44.306 --> 06:46.040
Hey, is that
from today's game?

06:46.075 --> 06:47.675
All right, Alex, go ahead
and make your jokes

06:47.710 --> 06:50.878
about me getting bench butt from
sitting on the bench all game.

06:50.913 --> 06:52.480
All right, Alex,
I'm recording.

06:52.514 --> 06:54.115
Do some of your
bench butt jokes.

06:56.385 --> 06:57.952
Give me that.

06:57.986 --> 06:59.354
George ignored me
the whole game,

06:59.388 --> 07:01.389
but I really think
he was checking me out.

07:02.391 --> 07:03.858
Hey, wait!

07:03.892 --> 07:05.927
He talked
to Mom and Dad.

07:05.961 --> 07:08.863
It looks like he's asking
permission to take you to the dance.

07:09.765 --> 07:11.199
Um, I'm sorry, honey.

07:11.233 --> 07:13.201
We thought your cheers
were hysterical

07:13.235 --> 07:15.470
but, um, he didn't.

07:15.504 --> 07:17.839
Well, what did he say?

07:17.873 --> 07:22.610
Well, he said they were, um...
How do I put this nicely?

07:23.412 --> 07:24.545
Annoying.

07:25.948 --> 07:28.616
See? He wanted it
to get back to me

07:28.650 --> 07:30.752
so that I'd think
he doesn't like me,

07:30.786 --> 07:33.087
but that means
he likes me even more.

07:33.122 --> 07:35.156
It is so obvious!

07:35.190 --> 07:37.759
He is like an elf
to my flame.

07:41.096 --> 07:43.364
Don't you mean
like a moth to your flame?

07:43.399 --> 07:46.634
Nope. I don't like moths.
They fly like they're broken.

08:00.115 --> 08:02.583
Hi, George! Great job
leading the band at the game.

08:02.618 --> 08:04.919
Yeah, OK, Alex,
whatever.

08:05.788 --> 08:08.022
And there it is.

08:09.925 --> 08:12.427
Acting like you don't
appreciate a compliment from me.

08:12.461 --> 08:15.496
Come on, George,
let's just cut to the chase.

08:15.531 --> 08:18.733
There's a homecoming dance coming up
and we might as well just go together.

08:18.767 --> 08:20.601
Nah, I don't think so.

08:20.636 --> 08:22.403
I see.

08:22.438 --> 08:24.305
More games, I get it.

08:24.339 --> 08:25.907
Well, here's a game for you.

08:25.941 --> 08:29.076
I'm gonna pretend that I don't like
you because I really do like you.

08:29.111 --> 08:30.745
Now you know.
Game over.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.414
Look, Alex,
I see you around

08:34.450 --> 08:36.650
always acting like you're
too cool to enjoy anything.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.419
Ah, so you have
noticed me.

08:38.453 --> 08:41.489
Yeah, you're a cheerleader, but
you're all negative about it.

08:41.523 --> 08:44.492
You're more like, uh,
like a boo-leader.

08:46.228 --> 08:47.495
Wait!

08:47.529 --> 08:50.097
Wait, wait.
Harper, Harper,

08:50.132 --> 08:53.301
tell George that I am not
that negative about everything.

08:53.335 --> 08:57.104
Are you asking me to lie to a
fellow member of the pep community?

08:58.407 --> 09:00.074
Thanks, Harper.

09:00.108 --> 09:02.176
Come on, you guys.
OK, yes, fine.

09:02.211 --> 09:06.047
I may have not been that
up with people in the past,

09:06.081 --> 09:07.982
but I can cheerlead
for real

09:08.016 --> 09:11.853
because being a positive,
supportive, upbeat person

09:11.887 --> 09:15.323
is what makes the world go
round and that's who I am!

09:19.527 --> 09:21.329
It's Scare People Wednesday.

09:26.668 --> 09:30.071
You're not gonna scare anybody
with your stupid videos.

09:30.105 --> 09:32.607
Oh, is it
Stupid Wednesday again?

09:34.276 --> 09:36.143
Maybe we should've tried it
on someone easier.

09:36.178 --> 09:38.646
Yeah. Oh, it's that skinny kid.

09:43.619 --> 09:46.487
There's no way you're going
to the dance with me, is there?

09:47.489 --> 09:50.591
I'm walking away.
You're just mean.

09:52.027 --> 09:54.529
Well, two negatives
make a positive.

09:54.563 --> 09:57.665
- And who's being negative now?
- Still you.

09:59.434 --> 10:00.968
Oh, you weren't
really asking.

10:01.003 --> 10:03.170
Well, it's Scare
People Wednesday.

10:09.064 --> 10:11.933
Look, Alex, George is a Happy.
You're a Maddy.

10:11.967 --> 10:14.735
Happies and Maddies
just don't get along.

10:14.770 --> 10:17.805
Well, I get along with you
and you're a Happy.

10:17.840 --> 10:21.476
Oh, dear, only on the
outside. That's why we work.

10:23.879 --> 10:26.681
If I'm gonna get George
to take me to the dance,

10:26.715 --> 10:28.216
I'm gonna have to be
more positive

10:28.250 --> 10:30.485
and there's only one way
I'm gonna do that.

10:30.519 --> 10:32.553
A complete change
in perspective?

10:34.189 --> 10:36.424
Oh, you're so cute.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.326
You think people
can change. No.

10:39.962 --> 10:41.896
I'm gonna need a spell.

10:41.930 --> 10:44.665
Let's see... Ah!
And here it is.

10:44.700 --> 10:47.368
This is a magical marker.

10:47.402 --> 10:50.705
Oh, Alex, I can do that.
This is a magical fish.

10:50.739 --> 10:53.674
This is a magical spoon.
This is a magical spider...

10:53.709 --> 10:55.343
Oh! It's a real spider!

10:56.778 --> 10:59.046
Harper, this is
a magical marker.

10:59.081 --> 11:03.718
All I have to do is write,
"be positive" on my arm.

11:04.386 --> 11:06.053
"Positive."

11:09.858 --> 11:13.461
Oh, Harper, you're such a wonderful
person who I'm lucky to have as a friend.

11:17.533 --> 11:20.101
Wait a minute,
are you pretending?

11:20.135 --> 11:24.505
How would you feel if I made
you a visor made of bread?

11:24.540 --> 11:27.642
With a matching
bagel purse?

11:39.388 --> 11:41.322
Mom, I don't understand
why I'm shooting this.

11:41.356 --> 11:43.491
I mean, I've already got
Justin sitting on the bench.

11:43.525 --> 11:45.426
Yeah, but you don't have
Justin sitting on the bench

11:45.460 --> 11:47.228
while I'm trying
to get his attention.

11:53.402 --> 11:56.137
Hi, sweetie.

11:56.171 --> 11:59.040
Hey, check it out. There's some guy
trying to eat popcorn off the floor.

12:02.077 --> 12:03.144
Dad.

12:04.546 --> 12:07.248
What? Five second rule,
it's still good.

12:09.551 --> 12:12.420
Um, there's a hair
on this one.

12:14.156 --> 12:15.556
Is there a rule on that?

12:15.591 --> 12:19.126
If you have to ask if there's
a rule, there's probably a rule.

12:20.762 --> 12:23.698
All right, Turkeys!

12:23.732 --> 12:26.467
Turkeys number one!

12:30.739 --> 12:32.506
Go Turkeys!

12:32.541 --> 12:35.376
Nice spirit, Alex.
George is gonna love this.

12:35.410 --> 12:37.211
Ready? OK!

12:37.245 --> 12:41.449
We are Tribeca Turkeys,
feathered and blue!

12:41.483 --> 12:45.086
The mighty, mighty Turkeys will
beat the stuffing out of you!

12:45.120 --> 12:46.954
- Whoo!
- Go Turkeys!

12:46.989 --> 12:48.990
Come on!
Come on, Turkeys!

12:54.463 --> 12:56.998
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho, Nelly!

12:57.032 --> 12:59.934
It looks like
I've broke a wild mustang

12:59.968 --> 13:03.638
and turned you into a pleasant,
yet spirited, turkey.

13:03.672 --> 13:05.940
Spirit!

13:06.675 --> 13:08.209
Yeah!

13:09.511 --> 13:11.946
There's not a student
I can't get through to.

13:11.980 --> 13:14.615
Mr. Laritate,
he's really great.

13:14.650 --> 13:17.351
I even think
he's lost some weight.

13:19.688 --> 13:20.955
Thanks.

13:20.989 --> 13:23.624
I can't find the key
to my snack drawer.

13:26.094 --> 13:28.629
Wow! Alex,
you're totally into it

13:28.664 --> 13:31.298
and you're being nice
to people?

13:31.333 --> 13:34.969
- I was wrong about you.
- Oh, that's OK. I'm not the type to hold a grudge.

13:36.438 --> 13:38.906
So, you still want to go
to the homecoming dance?

13:38.940 --> 13:40.474
Yes!

13:40.509 --> 13:42.209
Sorry, couch and TV.

13:42.244 --> 13:44.078
You're gonna have
to get along without me.

13:47.349 --> 13:49.517
Life is so good.

13:51.586 --> 13:53.854
I'm going to the homecoming
dance with George.

13:53.889 --> 13:56.524
- Yay!
- Yay!

13:56.558 --> 13:58.826
I've always wanted to do
this happy-yay jump with you.

14:03.732 --> 14:07.802
OK, I'm just gonna say out
loud what we're all thinking:

14:07.836 --> 14:10.538
Alex is under
a spell.

14:10.572 --> 14:13.340
What are we gonna do
about it?

14:13.375 --> 14:17.478
Well, she's being a positive,
upbeat member of society.

14:18.747 --> 14:20.881
All right, then.
We'll do nothing.

14:24.419 --> 14:27.755
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:27.789 --> 14:32.526
please welcome
the Tribeca Prep Turkeys!

14:41.036 --> 14:42.970
Ready? OK!

14:43.004 --> 14:45.039
Here come the Turkeys.

14:46.508 --> 14:48.109
Justin's got the water.

14:49.611 --> 14:51.612
They can't win without him.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.915
So let's applaud her.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.122
Hey, when in doubt,
flip out, right?

15:10.332 --> 15:12.600
Check out the clock,
check out the score!

15:12.634 --> 15:15.069
We are the Turkeys and
we'll show you the door.

15:20.142 --> 15:21.942
I wish they would put
Justin in.

15:21.977 --> 15:24.945
We're really far ahead.

15:26.548 --> 15:28.215
Substitution:

15:28.250 --> 15:31.685
In for Tribeca Prep,
Justin Russo.

15:50.305 --> 15:52.706
Don't worry,
we're really far ahead.

15:54.142 --> 15:55.910
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh!

15:55.944 --> 15:58.312
Justin's finally getting the
moment he's been waiting for!

15:58.346 --> 16:00.214
I'm so happy for him!

16:00.248 --> 16:02.550
Happy enough to do
the happy-yay jump?

16:02.584 --> 16:05.386
Oh, my gosh, yes!

16:18.266 --> 16:20.734
Oh, my gosh! I get to
finally do my Justin cheer.

16:21.970 --> 16:24.271
OK. Ready? OK!

16:24.306 --> 16:26.607
Justin's so funny,
Justin's so cute.

16:26.641 --> 16:28.409
Who could've guessed
he could even shoot?

16:28.443 --> 16:31.078
Whoo! Go Justin!
Go Justin!

16:31.112 --> 16:32.780
Oh, my gosh,
that was so awesome.

16:46.261 --> 16:49.363
Way to go, Justin,
way to go!

16:49.397 --> 16:52.299
Way to go, Justin,
way to go!

16:52.334 --> 16:54.435
Way to go,
Justin, way to go!

16:54.469 --> 16:58.172
Way to go, Justin, way to go!

16:58.206 --> 17:00.307
Way to go...

17:01.977 --> 17:04.044
Thanks to Justin Russo,

17:04.079 --> 17:07.146
Tribeca Prep
is way, way ahead.

17:10.518 --> 17:12.486
And that's the end
of the third quarter.

17:13.387 --> 17:15.356
Yay! Go Justin!

17:15.390 --> 17:17.491
Your cheering is really
helping the team.

17:17.525 --> 17:20.327
And so is your music.
We're the perfect couple.

17:20.362 --> 17:22.229
I can't wait
for the homecoming dance.

17:23.365 --> 17:25.366
We're gonna be together
forever.

17:28.369 --> 17:29.637
Here, I'm open,
I'm boxin'.

17:29.671 --> 17:31.171
I'm boxin' out.

17:31.206 --> 17:33.374
Someone set me a pick.
Set me a pick.

17:33.408 --> 17:36.176
I'm going. Oh, yeah.

17:41.049 --> 17:43.117
Gobble up those Wombats,
spit them out!

17:43.151 --> 17:45.319
Let a mongoose eat them
with sauerkraut!

17:49.724 --> 17:51.191
That wasn't very positive.

17:51.226 --> 17:53.394
I mean, how do you think
the Wombats feel?

17:53.428 --> 17:55.229
We're cheerleaders
for the Turkeys.

17:55.263 --> 17:57.531
That doesn't mean we can't
be positive for everyone.

17:57.565 --> 18:00.701
I'm positive that
that's a bad idea.

18:00.735 --> 18:02.703
We should cheer
for both teams.

18:02.737 --> 18:05.472
Hey, cheer associates,
you're all doing super

18:05.507 --> 18:09.576
but how about we spread that
spirit and cheer for both teams?

18:09.611 --> 18:11.578
That's a great idea.

18:11.613 --> 18:13.080
No, it is not.

18:13.114 --> 18:15.249
I just love cheering.

18:15.283 --> 18:16.884
Sit down! Sit!

18:21.589 --> 18:22.990
Oh! No time to quibble,

18:23.024 --> 18:25.359
I saw a Turkey
double dribble.

18:27.462 --> 18:29.730
Here we go, Wombats,
here we go!

18:29.764 --> 18:32.499
Here we go,
Wombats, here we go!

18:32.534 --> 18:35.035
Here we go,
Wombats, here we go!

18:39.607 --> 18:41.675
Come on, George,
play for the Wombats.

18:41.710 --> 18:44.345
- What are you doing?
- I'm being positive.

18:44.379 --> 18:47.348
And by being positive
we have to cheer for both teams.

18:47.382 --> 18:49.283
- No, we don't.
- Come on, band!

18:49.317 --> 18:52.186
Here we go, Wombats, here we go!

18:52.220 --> 18:54.655
Here we go, Wombats,
here we go!

18:59.661 --> 19:01.929
Here we go, Wombats,
here we go!

19:01.963 --> 19:04.531
Here we go,
Wombats, here we go!

19:04.566 --> 19:06.934
Here we go, Wombats,
here we go!

19:06.968 --> 19:08.736
- Here we go, Wombats...
- Stop playing!

19:08.770 --> 19:11.805
You're rousing the opposing team
with your musical stings.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.841
It's time to play defense!

19:13.875 --> 19:17.411
- Defense! Come on, defense!
- Here we go, Wombats, here we go!

19:17.445 --> 19:20.781
- Defense! Defense!
- Here we go, Wombats, here we go!

19:20.815 --> 19:23.417
Here we go, Wombats,
here we go!

19:23.451 --> 19:25.319
Here we go,
Wombats, here we go!

19:26.521 --> 19:28.956
Here we go,
Wombats, here we go!

19:28.990 --> 19:31.125
Defense! Defense!

19:31.159 --> 19:35.129
We're from Down Under.
We got that Wombat thunder!

19:40.334 --> 19:42.770
I don't believe this.
The Wombats are winning.

19:42.804 --> 19:46.740
See what we did?
Cheering uplifts everyone.

19:46.775 --> 19:49.376
Well, try and uplift this:

19:49.411 --> 19:51.245
I'm not going
to the dance with you.

19:53.448 --> 19:55.449
and even if we don't go together
it'll be so much fun.

19:55.483 --> 19:56.984
I can hardly wait.

19:57.018 --> 20:00.087
What is wrong with you?

20:00.121 --> 20:04.158
- And the Wombats win.
- Yay!

20:04.192 --> 20:07.995
- Thank you, Ms. Russo.
- Anytime. Anytime.

20:08.029 --> 20:11.498
In this case "thank you"
means "you can go now."

20:11.533 --> 20:14.835
As a matter of fact,
you can all go now.

20:14.869 --> 20:18.439
Until further notice,
pep band and cheerleaders

20:18.473 --> 20:20.641
are banned from all
sporting events.

20:20.675 --> 20:23.243
- What?!
- That's OK!

20:23.278 --> 20:25.846
Aww, it was fun while
it lasted, right, guys?

20:26.880 --> 20:30.350
Oh, you are boo-tiful!
I love you!

20:33.922 --> 20:36.356
And cheer rest.

20:39.461 --> 20:42.029
And I'm done with you.

20:42.063 --> 20:44.798
This is too much
positivity, even for me.

20:44.833 --> 20:46.366
Oh, look,
we're going on a walk.

20:49.671 --> 20:53.407
Aww, look at my best friend
helping me wash up.

20:53.441 --> 20:57.111
- You're so sweet.
- This is really hard to get off.

20:57.145 --> 20:58.912
But, look, you're trying
so hard... Ow!

20:58.947 --> 21:02.149
Harper, what are you doing?
That's freezing!

21:02.183 --> 21:03.884
Oh! Welcome back.

21:05.553 --> 21:08.288
I just love it when you
reject my hugs! Come here!

21:08.323 --> 21:09.790
Get off! Stop.

21:09.824 --> 21:12.960
- Why is there stuff on my face?
- I didn't do anything!

21:12.994 --> 21:15.162
- Did you put my hair in pigtails?
- I didn't!

21:20.628 --> 21:23.764
We lost the game, but still, what
an awesome senior year moment.

21:23.798 --> 21:26.867
And I'll have it recorded
for the rest of my life.

21:26.901 --> 21:29.303
- That's right. Let's check it out.
- Let's check it out.

21:29.337 --> 21:31.171
Here we go.
