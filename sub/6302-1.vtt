00:39.655 --> 00:42.724
Welcome, everyone!

00:44.226 --> 00:46.262
Tonight...

00:46.362 --> 00:50.054
I have something very special.

01:21.829 --> 01:23.598
For years,

01:23.698 --> 01:26.884
I have entertained all of you.

01:26.984 --> 01:29.353
- Have I not?
- Yes.

01:29.453 --> 01:31.454
And some of you,

01:31.554 --> 01:34.490
I have made very rich.

01:34.590 --> 01:36.291
Hell, yeah.

01:36.391 --> 01:38.201
Some...

01:38.301 --> 01:40.820
have made me a little richer.

01:41.828 --> 01:44.784
Time to place your bets.

01:44.884 --> 01:45.893
Yeah.

01:46.961 --> 01:50.132
- The videos.
- What do you think you are doing?

01:51.135 --> 01:52.771
It was my idea.

01:52.871 --> 01:57.305
You will not make a move unless I say.

01:58.908 --> 02:00.869
Understood?

02:06.315 --> 02:08.848
- Then let's begin.
- Yeah!

02:46.085 --> 02:49.455
God, I hate this place.
I'm freezing my balls off out here.

02:49.555 --> 02:51.027
You ain't got no balls.

02:51.127 --> 02:53.602
Don't worry about the cold,
worry about the snakes.

02:53.702 --> 02:56.338
Great, I hate snakes.

02:56.993 --> 02:59.429
- Full gear, boss?
- Yeah. All right, listen up, guys.

02:59.529 --> 03:02.141
We're on the clock. Harrigan, how far?

03:02.496 --> 03:07.011
Alright, just over this ridge line,
we got about two hours' slot.

03:10.836 --> 03:14.651
Hey, Michaels, do everybody a favor
and don't shoot yourself this time.

03:17.909 --> 03:19.966
Check your comms.

03:20.446 --> 03:22.881
Cooper, what're you doing?
No incendiaries, not necessary.

03:22.981 --> 03:27.029
Oh, come on. How about a smoke, boss?
Everyone likes a little smoke.

03:31.020 --> 03:34.558
We do this fast. Get the package,
get out. Simple snatch-and-grab.

03:34.658 --> 03:36.626
Target is Cyrus Merrick, 61,

03:36.726 --> 03:40.095
wanted for extortion, illegal gambling,
attempted murder... the list goes on.

03:40.195 --> 03:42.873
- What's the bounty?
- You know what it is.

03:45.363 --> 03:47.270
Half a million.

03:50.416 --> 03:53.503
Deadly force is not an option, boys.
If we kill him, we don't get paid.

03:53.603 --> 03:55.771
So, aim for the knees.

03:55.871 --> 03:57.509
- Got it?
- Yeah.

04:07.513 --> 04:10.093
Let's grab that payday.

04:14.185 --> 04:16.642
Once I inject the drug,

04:16.742 --> 04:20.012
- we will start the clock.
- Yeah!

04:20.112 --> 04:23.361
I have pulled these two
homeless men off the streets.

04:23.461 --> 04:28.775
No one knows they're here,
and no one will ever miss them.

05:03.163 --> 05:05.800
Lange, you're point. Let's move out.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.745
Copy.

05:31.253 --> 05:34.547
Cooper, Michaels, with me.
Harrigan, Lange, to the right.

05:34.647 --> 05:37.758
<i>Travis, get up on top of this truck
and provide some cover.</i>

05:38.358 --> 05:40.205
On me.

06:01.243 --> 06:04.080
Bargain is 1,000.

06:04.180 --> 06:06.526
Which one will die first?

06:06.626 --> 06:09.320
And how long will it take?

07:06.467 --> 07:09.338
Hey, what you doing? Hey, stop it.

07:09.438 --> 07:12.540
Hey, there's not supposed to be
any operations right now.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.560
Would you get get out of that thing.

07:33.457 --> 07:36.404
Don't kill them. The legs.
Aim for the legs.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.815
Oh, shit.

08:02.309 --> 08:04.322
Let's go.

08:05.945 --> 08:08.759
Let him die, let him die.

08:21.774 --> 08:25.485
Bail enforcement. Everybody on
the ground, hands behind your backs.

08:28.712 --> 08:31.966
Get the laptop, wipe the hard drives
and meet me outside.

08:32.066 --> 08:34.705
Cyrus Merrick, you're wanted
for illegal gambling,

08:34.804 --> 08:37.816
extortion and attempted murder.
You're coming with us.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.341
Fuck you.

08:46.409 --> 08:48.322
11 o'clock!

08:50.479 --> 08:53.783
It's over, Cyrus. Come with us,
and make it easy on yourself.

08:53.883 --> 08:58.731
Easy? Nothing in this life
is easy, bounty hunter.

09:49.765 --> 09:51.935
What have you done, Will?

09:52.035 --> 09:54.847
How are we going
to explain this to the cops?

10:53.890 --> 10:58.570
I understand a deal has been struck
between the defendant and the prosecution.

10:59.028 --> 11:02.964
Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Tanner
has changed his plea to guilty.

11:03.464 --> 11:05.977
Will Tanner.

11:07.634 --> 11:10.337
You've been found guilty
of involuntary manslaughter

11:10.437 --> 11:13.306
and are hereby sentenced
to two years suspended

11:13.406 --> 11:18.343
and five years' probation to commence at
the end of your suspended sentence period.

11:18.443 --> 11:20.414
Mr. Tanner...

11:20.514 --> 11:22.671
I don't like bounty hunters.

11:22.771 --> 11:24.415
We have police for a reason.

11:24.515 --> 11:27.951
Trained professionals whose job
it is to go after the bad guys,

11:28.051 --> 11:30.420
not gun-toting cowboys.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.289
You so much as spit on my sidewalk,

11:33.389 --> 11:36.858
and I will happily throw your ass in prison
for the full two years. Am I clear?

11:36.958 --> 11:38.592
Yes, Your Honor.

11:38.692 --> 11:40.871
I don't want to see you in here again.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.973
I'm done with that life, Your Honor.

11:45.595 --> 11:47.408
We're adjourned.

12:18.359 --> 12:20.246
Dad.

12:20.346 --> 12:22.634
Hey, Dad!

12:42.180 --> 12:44.359
Hey, Dad.

12:46.949 --> 12:48.829
Will?

12:49.384 --> 12:52.688
Yeah, hand me a 3/16.

13:03.163 --> 13:06.210
So, they didn't lock you up after all?

13:07.232 --> 13:11.279
- No, I took a plea.
- You took a plea. You gave up.

13:12.970 --> 13:16.618
- I killed a man, Dad.
- He was a criminal.

13:16.718 --> 13:19.920
Piece of shit murderer.
You could've beat that.

13:20.309 --> 13:24.505
Yeah. If I keep my nose clean,
I don't have to do any time.

13:24.605 --> 13:27.844
- I got off easy.
- Easy?

13:33.489 --> 13:34.899
Easy?

13:35.387 --> 13:37.274
Yeah, you got off easy.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.327
What about the family business?

13:43.427 --> 13:46.495
It took me 30 years to build it.

13:46.930 --> 13:50.556
You and that band of idiots,
took you 10 minutes to tear it down.

13:51.532 --> 13:54.946
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

13:56.536 --> 14:00.053
Sorry ain't gonna give me
back my reputation, boy.

14:03.109 --> 14:07.012
Listen, Dad, I came here to tell you
that I can't do this anymore.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.259
I'm out, Dad.

14:09.881 --> 14:14.330
You came here to tell me you're out?

14:17.854 --> 14:20.276
I give my boy the family business,

14:22.424 --> 14:25.237
and he just pisses it away.

14:27.143 --> 14:29.689
I should have known better.

14:29.789 --> 14:33.277
Yeah, I should have known better.

14:48.980 --> 14:51.143
Here we go.

14:51.629 --> 14:52.685
- Thanks, Pop.
- Got it?

14:52.785 --> 14:54.530
Yeah.

14:59.489 --> 15:02.626
You know, Dad, all I want
in life is peace and quiet.

15:02.726 --> 15:07.140
Just... no guns, no fugitives.

15:08.029 --> 15:10.409
Right, right, right.

15:10.997 --> 15:15.280
You never had what it takes, Will.
Too soft.

15:15.380 --> 15:17.702
Too much like your mother.

15:17.802 --> 15:22.485
God, I miss that woman.
Every goddamn day.

16:41.817 --> 16:45.021
Hey, Danni. So you got something for me.

16:45.121 --> 16:47.955
She's not pretty, but she does the job.

16:48.055 --> 16:51.426
- Or has done, right?
- Yeah, I got it.

16:51.526 --> 16:53.778
Sorry the pay's not better.
Tough times, you know?

16:53.878 --> 16:56.291
Yeah. Tell me about it.

17:02.034 --> 17:04.369
So, this place still your dad's?

17:04.470 --> 17:08.117
- I actually own it with him now.
- Oh. Look at you.

17:09.172 --> 17:13.353
- All right, go ahead and check her out.
- All right.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.916
She capable of towing anything?

17:24.717 --> 17:27.243
You're just gonna have
to find out for yourself.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.764
Fair enough.

17:36.391 --> 17:38.226
Not too shabby, right?

17:38.326 --> 17:41.596
You know what, Danni?
I think she'll work just fine.

17:41.696 --> 17:44.576
I'm going to put you on top
of the overtime list.

17:44.998 --> 17:47.195
I don't know what to say.

17:47.295 --> 17:51.349
- Thanks, Danni. I appreciate it.
- No problem.

17:57.310 --> 18:01.057
So, Danni, I'll wait for your call.

18:53.496 --> 18:56.198
<i>Will, come in.</i>

18:56.298 --> 18:58.067
Hey, Danni, go ahead.

18:58.167 --> 19:02.248
<i>We got a breakdown on the Interstate.
Go to bunker 40.</i>

19:03.170 --> 19:05.407
About 10 minutes off, Danni.

19:18.816 --> 19:20.785
Call for a tow?

19:20.885 --> 19:25.046
- Will?
- Michaels? How you been, man?

19:25.146 --> 19:28.757
I'm good. Well, I'm stuck in the middle
of nowhere, but good.

19:28.857 --> 19:32.487
- So, what's going on?
- It just died on me.

19:32.687 --> 19:34.729
I'll tell you what,
do me a favor, jump in there,

19:34.829 --> 19:38.276
turn... turn it over for me
and I'll see what's up.

19:42.868 --> 19:46.583
I think I see the problem.
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

20:05.823 --> 20:08.085
Go ahead and try it now.

20:10.661 --> 20:13.711
Thought the battery was dead,
but one of the contacts was loose.

20:14.730 --> 20:17.971
- You're good to go.
- Thanks.

20:18.466 --> 20:22.003
Look, I passed a little cantina
maybe a mile back.

20:22.103 --> 20:24.472
Buy you a cold one for old time's sake?

20:24.572 --> 20:28.601
Are you kidding me? Let's do it.
I'll see you over there.

20:48.927 --> 20:50.949
Thank you.

21:00.840 --> 21:05.528
- Check that out, Michaels. You see it?
- It's just a drone.

21:11.078 --> 21:13.841
Oh, they're everywhere these days.
They're kids.

21:19.184 --> 21:21.800
Hey, you okay?

21:21.900 --> 21:24.266
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm fine.

21:25.822 --> 21:27.861
You don't look okay.

21:27.961 --> 21:30.185
What's going on?

21:48.372 --> 21:50.818
What the hell's going on?

21:52.575 --> 21:55.009
I have to kill you, Will.

22:02.049 --> 22:05.512
Stay down. Just stay down. Stay down.

22:12.211 --> 22:14.557
He's coming around here.

22:29.506 --> 22:32.037
What the fuck you doing?

22:49.924 --> 22:52.827
- Why are you doing this?
- I don't want to, I have to.

22:52.927 --> 22:55.622
Or they'll kill me and my sister.

23:00.800 --> 23:04.663
Who's gonna kill your sister?
Who threatened you?

23:13.077 --> 23:15.160
Who threatened your sister? Talk to me.

23:15.260 --> 23:18.889
Don't. Don't do it. Stop!

23:29.290 --> 23:32.582
Michaels. Michaels!

24:11.026 --> 24:13.830
So, the victim, Ryan Michaels,

24:13.930 --> 24:16.265
he didn't want to kill you,
but he was trying to kill you.

24:16.365 --> 24:18.434
I know how it sounds, Officer.

24:18.534 --> 24:21.470
But it was self-defense.
You can ask anybody in there.

24:22.070 --> 24:24.439
Friends don't try to kill
each other for no reason.

24:24.539 --> 24:26.574
You've been convicted of manslaughter.
Is that right?

24:26.674 --> 24:29.341
- That has nothing to do with this.
- Answer the question.

24:29.441 --> 24:31.266
Yeah.

24:32.509 --> 24:36.179
I compared the story
and the waitress has video...

24:36.279 --> 24:39.248
Okay. Can you take her inside?

24:39.348 --> 24:42.499
- Am I being charged?
- No.

24:42.599 --> 24:46.552
Witnesses confirmed your story.
You're free to go. For now.

24:46.652 --> 24:50.021
Don't leave the state.
A man died here, Mr. Tanner.

24:50.121 --> 24:52.356
Someone's gotta pay for that.

24:52.456 --> 24:54.951
- Yes, Officer.
- All right.

25:01.659 --> 25:02.891
<i>You can't stay out of trouble</i>

25:02.991 --> 25:05.614
- <i>for 10 goddamn minutes, can you?</i>
- <i>Don't start, Dad.</i>

25:05.714 --> 25:08.470
This guy Michaels, he comes out
of nowhere with "Hey, how you doing?"

25:08.570 --> 25:12.069
And then "Boom!" Tries to whack you
between cervezas? Seriously.

25:12.169 --> 25:16.377
- Yeah, I know, it doesn't make any sense.
- No, it doesn't. Tell me what's going on.

25:16.477 --> 25:18.045
- I don't know.
- Bullshit.

25:18.145 --> 25:22.041
- Why don't you try taking my side for once?
- I'm here, aren't I?

25:23.549 --> 25:26.986
People act out of self-interest,
that's life, true and simple.

25:27.086 --> 25:30.656
Now, this friend of yours
tried to blow your head off.

25:31.489 --> 25:33.485
Which means you did something.

25:34.224 --> 25:37.526
- What did you do, Will?
- I don't know.

25:38.526 --> 25:40.855
Who the hell is that?

25:53.273 --> 25:56.542
- Hey, Will.
- Lange.

25:56.642 --> 25:59.312
Dad, this is James Lange.
He was part of my team.

25:59.412 --> 26:02.348
Yeah, I remember you.
Pretty good with a gun as I recall.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.876
I can hold my own.

26:05.215 --> 26:07.597
It's good to see you, man.

26:08.784 --> 26:11.419
So, what brings you out this way?

26:11.519 --> 26:14.155
Well, I heard what happened
with Michaels.

26:14.255 --> 26:16.040
How did you hear?
It happened an hour ago.

26:16.590 --> 26:19.492
- Word travels fast, you know.
- Show me your hand, shithead.

26:19.592 --> 26:22.398
- Asshole's packing.
- I can explain that.

26:22.498 --> 26:25.423
- Okay, okay.
- Nice and slow.

26:26.496 --> 26:27.925
All right.

26:28.998 --> 26:31.968
- PI.
- So you're a PI now.

26:32.068 --> 26:34.003
It still doesn't answer my question.

26:34.103 --> 26:37.238
- I have an answer for that, too. Okay.
- Slow as you can, little buddy.

26:37.338 --> 26:40.742
I got it. It's a police scanner.
That's all.

26:41.342 --> 26:44.504
They ran your sheet over the air.
I heard the whole thing.

26:45.844 --> 26:48.607
I know why Michaels
tried to kill you, Will.

26:50.348 --> 26:52.484
Take a ride with me.

26:52.584 --> 26:54.979
There's something I want to show you.

26:56.019 --> 26:58.088
Got a bad feeling about this.

26:58.188 --> 27:01.424
Whatever is going on,
you let the cops handle it.

27:01.824 --> 27:06.733
Pop, I know this guy. Come on,
just trust me, all right? Take it easy.

27:08.094 --> 27:10.323
I don't like it.

27:13.748 --> 27:15.910
Come on, let's go.

27:38.988 --> 27:41.424
Did you keep in touch
with Michaels at all?

27:41.524 --> 27:45.826
No. No. We just kind of went
our separate ways, you know?

27:45.926 --> 27:47.395
Yeah.

27:47.495 --> 27:51.130
- Until last night.
- What, you saw him?

27:51.430 --> 27:53.665
Yeah, it turns out we got
something in common.

27:53.765 --> 27:57.100
- And what's that?
- Somebody threatened to kill us.

27:57.200 --> 27:59.336
Threatened to kill you.

27:59.436 --> 28:01.638
What do you...
Who threatened to kill you?

28:01.738 --> 28:03.773
You know, it'll all make sense
when we get there.

28:03.873 --> 28:06.408
Get where? Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?

28:06.508 --> 28:10.286
What you need to worry about
is right here, alright?

28:10.777 --> 28:14.246
Focus on that. See that red circle?

28:14.346 --> 28:16.542
Be there by 5:00

28:16.642 --> 28:19.016
and then it's over.

28:19.116 --> 28:20.812
You're not making any sense.

28:22.919 --> 28:24.293
We're almost there.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.999
Michaels was acting
awful strange. Tense.

28:37.099 --> 28:40.234
Looking up everywhere he was going,
as if he was being watched.

28:40.334 --> 28:43.136
- Just like you.
- Wish it was different, buddy.

28:43.536 --> 28:45.427
Looks like I haven't got
a choice either.

29:34.416 --> 29:37.045
Give me the tally board.

29:46.593 --> 29:49.789
Ladies and gentlemen...

29:50.996 --> 29:54.172
Will Tanner is still alive.

29:54.733 --> 29:56.553
He survived for now.

29:59.035 --> 30:01.038
You gambled.

30:01.138 --> 30:03.171
And you lost.

30:03.271 --> 30:05.474
It's time to make a new wager.

30:05.574 --> 30:09.504
When and where he might die.

30:13.413 --> 30:16.844
Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets!

31:23.146 --> 31:25.983
Lange! What the hell's going on?

31:26.183 --> 31:29.186
Come on, Will.
I'll make it easy on you, buddy.

31:29.286 --> 31:31.898
One to the head, I promise.

32:27.421 --> 32:29.958
Lange, stop.
Why are you trying to kill me?

32:30.308 --> 32:33.845
I was just minding my own business,
trying to live my life.

32:33.945 --> 32:37.254
And this shit, your shit,
lands in my lap!

32:39.782 --> 32:41.034
Will!

33:50.680 --> 33:52.934
Hot damn!

33:59.388 --> 34:03.429
Hey, don't just stand there. Call 911!

35:36.781 --> 35:39.757
Travis. Oh, shit.

35:41.013 --> 35:42.900
Jesus.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.436
Goddamn son of...

35:47.536 --> 35:49.389
He always did have good instinct.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.485
God.

36:36.465 --> 36:37.894
Jesus.

36:45.472 --> 36:47.301
Damn!

36:57.950 --> 37:00.319
You! Behind the rocks!

37:00.419 --> 37:02.721
Drop the weapon, and step out now!

37:02.821 --> 37:04.989
No, lady. Just stay there. Stay there.

37:05.089 --> 37:07.591
Drop the weapon now.
Let me see your hands.

37:07.691 --> 37:10.893
No, no, no. You don't understand.
There's a shooter behind you on the ridge.

37:10.993 --> 37:13.929
Throw the weapon out.
Let me see your hands!

37:14.129 --> 37:16.818
I've just been shot.
You need to stay put, okay?

37:16.918 --> 37:20.934
Well, I got a call about a man matching
your description, shot and killed someone.

37:21.034 --> 37:23.402
So, I'm thinking you're the shooter.

37:23.502 --> 37:28.042
You're wrong. It's not what you think.
You don't understand! Just stay there.

37:28.674 --> 37:32.009
You have five seconds or a whole lot
of heat is coming your way.

37:32.109 --> 37:35.850
- Okay. Nice and easy, okay?
- Nice and easy.

37:36.150 --> 37:38.406
Put it down.

37:38.714 --> 37:41.010
- Step away.
- No, no, no. I got to stay here,

37:41.110 --> 37:44.186
and you need to stay there.
Listen to me. You need to stay there.

37:44.286 --> 37:45.987
Listen to what I'm saying, please!

37:46.087 --> 37:48.922
- Don't move. Don't come any closer.
- I'm going to ask you to shut up!

37:49.022 --> 37:52.991
Listen to me. No. Don't come any closer.

37:53.091 --> 37:56.027
- Don't. Don't.
- I'm coming to you.

37:56.477 --> 37:57.963
Stay where you are.

37:58.063 --> 38:00.400
- Sir, I'm going to approach you.
- You need to trust me.

38:00.500 --> 38:03.601
- No, no.
- I'm going to apprehend you, sir.

38:04.933 --> 38:06.928
God.

38:08.168 --> 38:09.740
That's on you, Will.

38:12.971 --> 38:14.284
Shit.

38:20.477 --> 38:22.037
Shit.

39:08.222 --> 39:10.158
Get in!

39:10.258 --> 39:12.459
Harrigan?

39:12.559 --> 39:14.871
Shit.

39:14.971 --> 39:17.727
Do you want to live or not? Come on!

39:26.269 --> 39:29.133
Get in. What're you waiting for?

39:29.237 --> 39:31.299
Get in!

40:45.548 --> 40:48.814
- What the hell's going on?
- Don't I get brownie points for saving your life?

40:48.914 --> 40:52.630
- Why is our old crew trying to kill me?
- Easy, big guy.

40:52.730 --> 40:55.869
Calm down.
I'll tell you everything I know.

40:58.186 --> 40:59.980
Will...

41:03.690 --> 41:06.640
You so much as twitch wrong,
and I'll snap your neck.

41:07.140 --> 41:09.427
Sounds fair.

41:10.462 --> 41:13.464
Can we go inside? I could use a drink.

41:13.564 --> 41:15.627
After you.

41:31.615 --> 41:33.678
You want to tell me what you know?

41:36.253 --> 41:39.188
- Who came at you today?
- Michaels.

41:39.288 --> 41:41.358
Then, Lange.

41:41.458 --> 41:44.620
- And Travis up on the rocks?
- Yeah.

41:49.363 --> 41:53.149
A week ago, guess what piece
of shit shows up at my door.

41:53.249 --> 41:56.146
- Raul Baccaro.
- Baccaro.

41:56.936 --> 41:59.806
<i>Cyrus Merrick's number two?</i>

41:59.906 --> 42:02.825
<i>Well, since you smoked Cyrus,
he got promoted to number one.</i>

42:04.475 --> 42:07.090
Worse than Cyrus ever was.

42:07.644 --> 42:11.248
- Well, what did he want?
- I had to do one thing...

42:11.714 --> 42:14.010
Kill Will Tanner.

42:23.824 --> 42:26.694
All right, gentlemen,
I want you to drink more.

42:26.794 --> 42:30.230
And bet a lot more. All right.

42:30.330 --> 42:32.365
Hey, it's good to see you.

42:32.465 --> 42:35.694
Where did you get the idea for all this?

42:36.467 --> 42:38.053
Well...

42:38.153 --> 42:41.254
there's this private event
on an island where...

42:41.354 --> 42:44.275
they force condemned men
to fight to the death.

42:44.375 --> 42:47.610
I remember. They were shut down.

42:47.710 --> 42:51.291
Fools. Playing for pennies.

42:51.391 --> 42:53.915
Letting everybody participate.

42:54.015 --> 42:57.952
The game of life and death
should be a privilege.

42:58.052 --> 43:02.388
Reserved for the elite.
Like yourself, Alexi.

43:02.488 --> 43:04.917
Like all my friends here.

43:11.696 --> 43:13.765
Cyrus always said,

43:13.865 --> 43:17.934
one man's pain is another man's profit.

43:18.034 --> 43:20.604
And the only way to ensure profit,

43:20.704 --> 43:24.072
is to be the one bringing the pain.

43:25.874 --> 43:28.995
Raul must have threatened Michaels
and Lange, too. He had to.

43:29.495 --> 43:32.098
Michaels was supposed
to take you out to the arroyo.

43:32.748 --> 43:35.181
Travis and Lange
would be laying in wait.

43:35.281 --> 43:38.551
- You too.
- Yeah, I played along.

43:38.651 --> 43:42.321
The men here are responsible
for killing Cyrus.

43:42.421 --> 43:43.937
Cooper...

43:44.037 --> 43:47.557
Harrigan, Michaels...

43:47.657 --> 43:51.460
Travis, Lange...

43:51.560 --> 43:53.296
Will.

43:53.396 --> 43:57.025
I only found it fitting
that they be our contestants.

43:58.198 --> 44:00.365
What is that word?

44:00.465 --> 44:02.116
Oh, yeah.

44:02.234 --> 44:04.078
Karma.

44:07.771 --> 44:10.233
You all enjoy.

44:12.908 --> 44:16.505
Lange, he... he gave me this.

44:17.078 --> 44:19.813
He said I had to be here by 5:00.

44:19.913 --> 44:21.981
What does that mean?

44:22.081 --> 44:26.312
Raul said if you get here,
you get to live.

44:26.752 --> 44:31.183
The arroyo was just a starting point.
Along the way? Open season.

44:32.189 --> 44:35.926
Only way out of this is to go
to the cops. Tell them about Raul.

44:36.026 --> 44:38.560
You think the cops
are gonna listen to you?

44:38.660 --> 44:40.969
Michaels is dead. So is Lange.

44:41.069 --> 44:44.499
And now a deputy sheriff. And the only
thing they have in common is you.

44:44.599 --> 44:48.302
You go to the cops, tell them
what you know. That backs up my story.

44:48.402 --> 44:51.638
And then maybe if we're lucky,
if we're very lucky,

44:51.738 --> 44:55.777
there's proof that Raul threatened Michaels
and Lange, just like he threatened you.

44:55.877 --> 44:59.211
I don't wanna shit on your pillow, boss,
but we've got a couple of glaring problems.

44:59.511 --> 45:03.771
First, Travis is still out there wanting
to put a couple of extra holes in your head.

45:19.261 --> 45:23.265
Then there's Cooper. A psycho ex-<i>compadre</i>
who likes burning and blowing shit up.

45:23.365 --> 45:25.667
Doesn't mean Cooper's part of this.

45:25.767 --> 45:28.262
You wanna bet your life on that?

45:28.968 --> 45:31.214
Yeah, I do.

45:34.056 --> 45:37.524
Ladies and gentlemen!

45:37.742 --> 45:40.350
Will Tanner's luck hold on?

45:40.450 --> 45:42.407
Will he survive?

45:43.347 --> 45:46.846
Do any of you have
the stones to bet it all

45:46.946 --> 45:50.337
that Tanner will survive my little game?

45:53.154 --> 45:57.552
Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets!

46:12.472 --> 46:14.146
That's funny!

46:16.893 --> 46:18.429
Place your bets!

46:24.449 --> 46:26.413
Let's go.

46:31.121 --> 46:33.707
What? You got a better idea?

46:33.807 --> 46:36.234
Yeah, I do.

46:52.739 --> 46:54.640
Looks brand new.

46:54.740 --> 46:58.211
Raul gave it to me.
It's clean, no serial number.

46:58.311 --> 47:00.572
Was supposed to use it on you.

47:03.214 --> 47:07.032
- Glad you didn't.
- Don't make me regret that.

47:09.819 --> 47:12.147
What the hell?

47:28.634 --> 47:31.863
Get out! Get out!

47:43.448 --> 47:45.328
Jesus!

48:22.849 --> 48:25.742
Grand on the table, bets all in?

48:29.555 --> 48:31.621
Not yet.

48:36.194 --> 48:38.256
Go, go, go!

48:42.732 --> 48:44.624
Shit.

49:01.850 --> 49:05.720
- Where is my drone?
- Closing in on the target.

49:05.820 --> 49:08.055
Hey, you should be there
when he buys it.

49:08.155 --> 49:11.412
You know, standing over him,
big game hunter-style.

49:11.512 --> 49:13.985
Are you mocking me?

49:18.461 --> 49:20.797
Is that what you're doing?

49:20.897 --> 49:23.942
No, I... I would never.

49:25.967 --> 49:30.371
Merrick built his empire on blood.

49:30.471 --> 49:34.357
He fought and scraped
to earn the respect

49:34.457 --> 49:37.410
of all the people that worked for him.

49:37.710 --> 49:39.379
But I don't.

49:39.479 --> 49:42.148
It's five times greater than anything

49:42.248 --> 49:44.845
he would have ever dreamed of.

49:45.584 --> 49:49.552
Because I honor something
bigger than respect...

49:49.652 --> 49:51.620
fear.

49:51.720 --> 49:53.625
Tell me...

49:54.511 --> 49:57.105
do you fear me?

49:57.958 --> 50:00.821
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

50:32.456 --> 50:36.985
Not good. Not good. We're losing power.
I think he hit the engine.

50:45.332 --> 50:48.695
Come on. Inside, inside!
Clear out, people!

50:57.608 --> 51:00.874
- What? What're you...
- Listen, we don't want any trouble.

51:00.974 --> 51:03.381
But there's some asshole
out there with a rifle.

51:03.481 --> 51:06.615
Yeah? And there's a bitch
in here with a shotgun.

51:06.715 --> 51:10.352
Listen. Listen to me, okay?
We go out there, we're both dead.

51:11.552 --> 51:13.281
Not my problem.

51:16.823 --> 51:18.791
I'm calling the police.

51:18.891 --> 51:20.952
Good!

51:27.863 --> 51:30.025
I'm sorry.

51:31.666 --> 51:34.669
- You see Travis?
- No, I don't see him.

51:34.769 --> 51:36.454
Yeah. I know the guy.

51:36.554 --> 51:39.805
He'll take up a position,
wait for us to pop our heads out.

51:39.905 --> 51:41.674
I'm thinking right up there.

51:41.774 --> 51:45.209
Perfect vantage point.
He can cover the entire front.

51:45.309 --> 51:46.836
Take this.

51:47.712 --> 51:51.241
- Listen, we're sorry about all this, okay?
- Screw you.

51:53.149 --> 51:55.880
Pick up. Pick up. Dad.

51:55.980 --> 51:58.030
- <i>You okay, son?</i>
- Yeah.

51:58.130 --> 52:00.845
Listen... I need your help.

52:11.129 --> 52:13.021
Jesus!

52:21.103 --> 52:23.966
Take cover! Protect the girl.

52:33.581 --> 52:34.632
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

52:34.732 --> 52:36.742
Just stay down!

52:39.083 --> 52:40.646
Shit.

52:53.579 --> 52:55.423
$10,000. $10,000.

52:56.638 --> 52:59.761
- I want mine!
- Okay.

53:18.082 --> 53:21.151
Gas! Come on!

53:21.251 --> 53:24.529
Come on. Follow me! Stop, stop, stop!

53:54.830 --> 53:57.727
Come with me. Keep your head down.
Keep your head down. Stay right here.

53:57.827 --> 54:01.287
You're gonna be safe. Everything's gonna
be all right. Just keep your head down.

54:01.986 --> 54:04.415
Get into the truck, come on!

54:14.163 --> 54:15.865
No. Gas.

54:15.965 --> 54:18.327
Gas, gas, gasoline! Go, go, go!

54:37.516 --> 54:39.879
Dad. Come on.

54:43.413 --> 54:45.549
Where you been, Dad?

55:05.204 --> 55:07.909
Will, what the hell happened?
Where's Lange?

55:08.009 --> 55:10.293
He's dead. He tried to kill me, too.

55:10.393 --> 55:13.187
Hey, Frank, long time.

55:23.952 --> 55:25.795
Fuck!

55:25.895 --> 55:27.742
Damn it!

55:43.668 --> 55:47.572
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have a flask
or something dangerous on you, would you?

55:47.672 --> 55:50.100
As a matter of fact...

55:51.374 --> 55:55.738
- Here we go.
- You, sir, are still my hero.

56:24.671 --> 56:27.073
That's good, Will.

56:27.173 --> 56:30.644
If all this is true, we got to call in
the big guns, the Feds, maybe.

56:30.744 --> 56:33.713
I got some contacts
we can reach out to in D.C.

56:33.813 --> 56:34.985
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

56:35.085 --> 56:38.755
If all this is true... how is anybody
supposed to believe me if you don't?

56:38.855 --> 56:41.420
Son, it is a lot to process.

56:41.520 --> 56:44.155
A lot to process?
I killed two people today, Pop.

56:44.255 --> 56:47.090
- Try processing that.
- Killing a man is hard, I know.

56:47.190 --> 56:50.992
I took over the family business,
tried to make you proud. I fucked up.

56:51.092 --> 56:54.173
I was done trying to be like you.
But here I am.

56:54.273 --> 56:56.523
My father's son.

57:10.309 --> 57:12.671
Shit. Stop!

57:20.734 --> 57:23.024
Easy, easy, easy.

57:23.352 --> 57:25.854
Oh, shit. That's close.

57:25.954 --> 57:29.183
- Guess who this belongs to?
- Cooper.

57:30.857 --> 57:33.827
Hey. Check it out.

57:33.927 --> 57:36.795
What do you think? An invitation?

57:36.895 --> 57:39.281
Yeah. No, thanks.

57:39.381 --> 57:42.039
How about we just get back in the truck
and we pull a u-ey,

57:42.139 --> 57:44.335
- and we get the hell out of here?
- A detour.

57:44.435 --> 57:46.970
He's leading us right into this trap.

57:47.070 --> 57:52.241
You think our good old buddy Cooper
is just, what, gonna let us drive away?

57:52.341 --> 57:56.538
- Worth a shot.
- No, we find Cooper now...

57:56.677 --> 57:58.646
and maybe he'll lead us to Raul.

57:58.746 --> 58:02.349
We find Cooper now,
and we get our asses blown to shit.

58:02.449 --> 58:04.410
What the...

58:10.655 --> 58:13.257
- What the fuck you doing, Dad?
- What's it look like?

58:13.357 --> 58:16.151
Raul doesn't want anything to do
with you. He wants a piece of me.

58:16.251 --> 58:20.221
- So you just go home!
- Not on your life, son.

58:27.984 --> 58:29.978
Let's go.

58:30.537 --> 58:33.171
I did not see that comin'.

58:33.271 --> 58:34.487
Hey.

58:45.716 --> 58:48.211
Are you sure we are in the right place?

58:49.452 --> 58:52.248
What do you think? Yeah.

58:57.474 --> 58:59.795
Yeah, we're in the right place.

58:59.895 --> 59:02.324
Come on. Just watch your step.

59:03.565 --> 59:06.467
You know what? Enough of this shit.

59:06.567 --> 59:09.168
Cooper, I'm here.

59:09.268 --> 59:11.371
Show yourself!

59:11.471 --> 59:14.880
You really think it's a good idea
to poke the bear?

59:15.373 --> 59:17.312
Where you at? Come on!

59:21.510 --> 59:24.540
Shit. Will?

59:25.013 --> 59:26.990
Shit.

59:27.416 --> 59:29.577
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

59:41.827 --> 59:46.191
A foot in diameter.
This is a nasty mine. Okay.

59:55.639 --> 59:57.818
You're gonna slide your foot back.
But whatever you do,

59:57.918 --> 01:00:01.645
- don't lift your foot off that pressure place.
- Easy. Easy. Easy.

01:00:01.745 --> 01:00:04.979
Just breathe, be calm, all right?
Nice and slow, on three.

01:00:05.079 --> 01:00:06.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.198
On three. One...

01:00:11.104 --> 01:00:14.744
two... Easy. Hold up, hold up.

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.982
You got it, you got it.

01:00:29.968 --> 01:00:31.305
Easy, easy, easy.

01:00:33.253 --> 01:00:36.149
Move your foot back nice and slow.

01:00:38.206 --> 01:00:41.218
- Thanks.
- Holy shit.

01:00:41.542 --> 01:00:44.745
My money says he's got
this whole canyon rigged.

01:00:49.046 --> 01:00:50.504
Oh, shit.

01:00:50.604 --> 01:00:52.475
Run!

01:01:32.619 --> 01:01:34.954
We're good up here for now.

01:01:35.054 --> 01:01:39.103
I'm gonna kill... You heard me, Cooper?

01:01:39.657 --> 01:01:43.554
- What happened to poking the bear?
- I'm gonna carve this bear a new asshole.

01:01:46.728 --> 01:01:48.790
He's close.

01:01:51.232 --> 01:01:53.794
He likes to admire his handiwork.

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.241
Harrigan.

01:02:03.341 --> 01:02:05.203
Back up.

01:02:07.144 --> 01:02:09.406
Back up.

01:02:38.468 --> 01:02:40.330
God!

01:03:03.056 --> 01:03:06.124
Cooper? Get out of the truck!

01:03:06.724 --> 01:03:08.486
It's over!

01:03:08.975 --> 01:03:11.307
Come on, man, get out of the truck.

01:03:12.627 --> 01:03:14.456
Get out of the truck!

01:03:22.769 --> 01:03:25.231
You shoot, I pull the pin as I fall.

01:03:33.444 --> 01:03:35.047
Put the gun down.

01:03:35.147 --> 01:03:38.016
Come on, Coop. You don't want to do that.
Put down the grenade.

01:03:38.116 --> 01:03:41.596
No. I don't work for you anymore.
You can't tell me what to do.

01:03:41.696 --> 01:03:45.126
It doesn't matter who you work for. Put down
the grenade. Come on. We don't have to...

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.616
Put the gun down, Will.

01:03:50.189 --> 01:03:52.962
No, no, no. Crazy son of a bitch.

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:54.899
- You always were.
- I'm slipping here.

01:03:54.999 --> 01:03:58.796
You don't have to... Okay, okay,
hey, hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy.

01:03:59.296 --> 01:04:01.330
All right, Coop.

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:03.292
You win.

01:04:05.199 --> 01:04:07.035
No gun.

01:04:08.204 --> 01:04:10.597
Now it's your turn.

01:04:11.354 --> 01:04:13.916
Put down that grenade.

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:17.535
Put down the fucking grenade.

01:04:20.643 --> 01:04:22.313
Motherfucker.

01:04:32.186 --> 01:04:34.281
Fuck you!

01:04:41.626 --> 01:04:44.487
Cooper. You don't have to do this!

01:04:45.112 --> 01:04:47.582
Yes, I... do!

01:04:47.932 --> 01:04:49.734
I know Raul threatened to kill you.

01:04:49.834 --> 01:04:53.564
Yeah. And if it's between you and me,
I choose me every time.

01:05:10.717 --> 01:05:13.078
God damn it.

01:05:15.253 --> 01:05:17.482
Shit, no way!

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:41.636
Back off. I said back off.

01:05:48.115 --> 01:05:51.918
- You don't know everything that's going on.
- Freeze! Hands above your head!

01:05:52.018 --> 01:05:54.546
Shit. Great.

01:05:59.056 --> 01:06:00.796
Stop!

01:06:03.392 --> 01:06:06.088
Slippery little fuck.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:15.762
Gotcha.

01:06:23.608 --> 01:06:25.370
Will?

01:06:26.443 --> 01:06:30.112
Will, can you hear me?
Hold on, buddy. Hold on. Easy.

01:06:30.212 --> 01:06:32.805
- Give me a first aid kit.
- Holy shit.

01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:36.710
Oh, God.

01:06:54.898 --> 01:06:57.104
Sucks!

01:07:15.151 --> 01:07:17.386
Is he dead?

01:07:17.486 --> 01:07:19.348
Closer.

01:07:20.721 --> 01:07:25.047
Will. Hang in there, buddy.
Can you hear me? It's his arm.

01:07:27.994 --> 01:07:30.363
<i>Hang in there, buddy. Will! Hold on.</i>

01:07:30.663 --> 01:07:34.098
- Is Will Tanner dead? Yes or no.
- I'm not sure.

01:07:34.198 --> 01:07:35.616
Well, find out!

01:07:35.716 --> 01:07:39.112
Move the drone closer! I need to know!

01:07:40.501 --> 01:07:43.564
Easy, easy.

01:07:44.171 --> 01:07:46.633
It looks like he is still alive.

01:07:54.713 --> 01:07:57.950
You're damn lucky.
Wound's a through-and-through.

01:07:58.050 --> 01:08:01.470
Bullet missed your vital organs.
These will help with the pain.

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:03.652
You done?

01:08:03.752 --> 01:08:07.188
- No, he's under arrest.
- For what?

01:08:07.288 --> 01:08:10.216
He's wanted for two murders.
Possibly a third.

01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:12.684
Jesus!

01:08:13.134 --> 01:08:15.227
Honey, I'm home!

01:08:15.327 --> 01:08:17.429
Hey, there, cowboy.
I got a present for you.

01:08:17.629 --> 01:08:19.791
Put that down right now!

01:08:20.964 --> 01:08:23.245
What, Cooper, you're back
to finish the job?

01:08:23.345 --> 01:08:26.361
No. I'm here to help.

01:08:28.536 --> 01:08:30.832
Can you walk?

01:08:31.872 --> 01:08:35.377
All right. Hey, you.
Stay face down on the ground.

01:08:35.477 --> 01:08:37.928
In fact, you guys give me a minute.

01:08:38.278 --> 01:08:39.747
I got an idea.

01:08:46.285 --> 01:08:49.721
- What the hell did you just do?
- I just bought us some time.

01:08:49.822 --> 01:08:53.451
He's bat-shit crazy.
You do realize that, right?

01:09:05.035 --> 01:09:07.270
Dead man walking.

01:09:07.371 --> 01:09:11.241
Please, Will. Run, hide, bleed.

01:09:11.341 --> 01:09:15.611
The longer you live,
the more money I make.

01:09:15.711 --> 01:09:19.008
Right up to the moment
someone puts a bullet in your head.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.617
You all right?

01:09:33.559 --> 01:09:36.468
- They went that way?
- Yeah, they went over there.

01:09:40.631 --> 01:09:44.424
- Why did you come back, Coop?
- You saved my life.

01:09:44.524 --> 01:09:47.130
I figured might as well
return the favor.

01:09:47.737 --> 01:09:50.471
Look, man.
I didn't want to do any of this.

01:09:50.572 --> 01:09:53.642
- Welcome to the club.
- How'd they get to you?

01:09:53.742 --> 01:09:57.511
A few nights ago, put a gun in my mouth,
it was either I kill you or they were gonna...

01:09:57.611 --> 01:10:01.913
Hold on. Is that my old man in the middle
of the road? Stop the truck.

01:10:07.150 --> 01:10:09.552
Jesus, Will. Have you been shot?

01:10:10.052 --> 01:10:12.729
I'm fine, Dad. What're you doing here?

01:10:13.089 --> 01:10:16.124
Well, I found this in my truck.
Where you dropped it.

01:10:16.224 --> 01:10:18.801
So I figured this is
where you were headed.

01:10:19.327 --> 01:10:22.429
I also figured I owe you a pop in the mouth
for that sucker punch you gave me.

01:10:22.529 --> 01:10:26.225
But seeing as how you're all shot up...
Oh, son of a bitch!

01:10:26.631 --> 01:10:30.202
- Okay. I'll call it square.
- Nothing like a father's love.

01:10:30.302 --> 01:10:33.638
- Going out there is suicide.
- Yeah, I know, but I'm done runnin', Pop.

01:10:33.738 --> 01:10:36.808
This Raul wants me. So, here I come.

01:10:36.908 --> 01:10:39.176
<i>I should have believed you
from the beginning.</i>

01:10:39.276 --> 01:10:42.547
<i>Listen, I know you say
all your violence is behind you.</i>

01:10:43.147 --> 01:10:46.581
But if you come across that bastard, you put
his ass in the ground. You understand me?

01:10:46.931 --> 01:10:49.152
- You got it.
- All right. You get in my truck.

01:10:49.452 --> 01:10:53.529
- This truck's all over the police scanner.
- Dad, listen. I said you're not part of this.

01:10:53.629 --> 01:10:56.517
I'm your father, son.

01:10:59.559 --> 01:11:03.019
Look at that. Here we go.

01:11:14.736 --> 01:11:16.832
Fuck!

01:11:26.646 --> 01:11:28.116
Put me on the board.

01:11:30.849 --> 01:11:33.736
- Put me on the board!
- Really?

01:11:34.136 --> 01:11:37.956
If Will Tanner survives,
I won't be able to cover the line.

01:11:38.056 --> 01:11:40.417
And I will lose everything.

01:11:43.259 --> 01:11:45.988
Either someone else kills him...

01:11:46.628 --> 01:11:48.462
or I do.

01:11:48.562 --> 01:11:51.024
Put it on the board.

01:11:51.997 --> 01:11:53.666
Piece of shit.

01:11:53.766 --> 01:11:55.662
Son...

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:58.291
I'm here to help, tell me what I can do.

01:12:01.538 --> 01:12:04.467
- Nice shot.
- You know it.

01:12:06.207 --> 01:12:08.542
Your old man's kind of a badass.

01:12:08.642 --> 01:12:12.039
Yeah, he is.

01:12:12.345 --> 01:12:14.347
Now, let's get the fuck out of here.

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:17.550
- One more.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:22.747
get ready to open your wallets
for a major shift in our festivities.

01:12:24.788 --> 01:12:29.086
I am now officially a contestant.

01:12:45.073 --> 01:12:48.837
This is it, guys.
This is where the map ends.

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:56.249
Last time I wore one of these,
things didn't go too well, Pop.

01:12:56.349 --> 01:12:58.518
Just put it on.

01:12:58.618 --> 01:13:02.948
Okay, we'll recon the area and see
what we're dealing with. Stay with me.

01:13:11.395 --> 01:13:13.657
Come on, Will. Let's go.

01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:16.392
Come here.

01:13:22.837 --> 01:13:25.140
Raul knows we're coming, Pop.

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:28.409
- We'll never catch him by surprise.
- Maybe we'll get lucky.

01:13:28.509 --> 01:13:31.077
Yeah, 'cause things
have gone great so far.

01:13:31.177 --> 01:13:34.023
Well, it's as good a day to die as any.

01:13:34.123 --> 01:13:36.636
Yeah, don't say shit like that.
What's wrong with you?

01:13:36.736 --> 01:13:39.614
Will, it's your rodeo, little buddy.

01:13:39.714 --> 01:13:41.743
Make the call.

01:13:43.751 --> 01:13:46.480
All right, guys.
Bring it in and listen up.

01:13:55.928 --> 01:13:57.597
Men, take out his backup.

01:13:57.697 --> 01:14:03.205
Under no circumstances does anybody
fire on Will Tanner. I alone will kill him.

01:14:05.268 --> 01:14:07.797
Yeah, Raul!

01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:25.653
Some of you go to the left.
Some of you go to the right.

01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:29.349
Circle around, make sure
these other guys are dead!

01:14:41.456 --> 01:14:43.299
Yeah!

01:15:22.869 --> 01:15:26.289
Come on, Will. Show yourself.

01:15:32.077 --> 01:15:33.773
Where are you, Will?

01:15:38.781 --> 01:15:40.615
Will.

01:15:41.015 --> 01:15:44.410
- Hey there, Will.
- Put your rifle down, Travis.

01:15:46.218 --> 01:15:48.737
I said put the rifle down.

01:15:51.055 --> 01:15:53.151
Don't... don't do it.

01:16:49.343 --> 01:16:51.172
Get down!

01:17:16.836 --> 01:17:20.065
All right. Let's go. Go, go, go.

01:17:29.547 --> 01:17:33.143
Son of a bitch. Son of a...

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:36.712
- Dad!
- Goddamn son of a...

01:18:21.561 --> 01:18:25.217
Here we are. The final game.

01:18:25.717 --> 01:18:27.626
Let's finish this, Raul.

01:18:29.566 --> 01:18:34.169
It's 5:00. I'm here. Let's end this.

01:18:34.469 --> 01:18:39.421
It's actually 5:03.
But either way, you lose.

01:18:45.044 --> 01:18:47.273
Come on, boss!

01:19:49.707 --> 01:19:51.943
Actually, I should be thanking you.

01:19:52.243 --> 01:19:56.875
You gave me an opportunity
and I'm just exploiting it.

01:20:18.998 --> 01:20:23.897
In there, high-rollers have been
betting on your life all day.

01:20:24.904 --> 01:20:26.940
You're telling me...

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.809
people are in there
right now betting on me.

01:20:29.909 --> 01:20:34.639
Millions and millions.
A game of life and death.

01:20:37.447 --> 01:20:39.676
That's correct.

01:20:40.082 --> 01:20:44.132
The only kind worth playing.

01:20:45.719 --> 01:20:49.705
People gambling on whether or not
we all kill each other.

01:20:49.805 --> 01:20:51.232
That's right.

01:20:57.161 --> 01:20:59.330
You're gonna make me a rich man.

01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:03.317
You had a good run.
But it's time to cash in.

01:21:59.352 --> 01:22:02.348
I had regrets about killing Cyrus.

01:22:06.978 --> 01:22:09.340
You, not so much.

01:22:26.509 --> 01:22:31.147
Tanner, you're a one-man wrecking crew.
You did what half my force couldn't do.

01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:33.982
You should be proud of this boy here.

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:36.952
Thanks a lot. Hey, can I call you Will?

01:22:37.052 --> 01:22:39.721
You got a job at the Sherriff's
department anytime you need it.

01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:43.250
Thanks, Officer. Thank you, Officer.

01:22:47.093 --> 01:22:48.996
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:22:49.096 --> 01:22:52.325
Will, I've been thinking...

01:22:53.032 --> 01:22:55.035
I've been thinking about
coming out of retirement.

01:22:55.135 --> 01:22:57.697
Oh, God. Don't say it.

01:22:58.304 --> 01:23:02.633
- Guys, you all right? We're good?
- Always good, boss.

01:23:05.074 --> 01:23:10.326
Hear me out. "Tanner and Son Fugitive
Recovery." What do you think?

01:23:10.426 --> 01:23:13.119
- I told you, Pop, I'm out.
- I heard you. You're on. All right.

01:23:13.219 --> 01:23:15.316
- I like it.
- Yeah, Frank, I like it too.

01:23:15.416 --> 01:23:18.118
- Sounds classy.
- Classy! You hear that?

01:23:18.518 --> 01:23:20.447
Classy. He called it classy.
