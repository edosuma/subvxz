WEBVTT

00:01.484 --> 00:04.004
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.142 --> 00:06.627
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:06.765 --> 00:11.735
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.873 --> 00:14.635
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.773 --> 00:17.638
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.776 --> 00:21.607
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.368 --> 00:25.818
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:25.956 --> 00:28.580
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.718 --> 00:31.065
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.203 --> 00:33.792
Just to get up that hill

00:33.930 --> 00:36.415
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.553 --> 00:39.039
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.177 --> 00:41.489
As long as we live
it's you and me, baby

00:41.627 --> 00:43.629
Ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.767 --> 00:46.115
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.253 --> 00:49.118
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.256 --> 00:53.605
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.743 --> 00:56.539
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.677 --> 00:59.576
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.714 --> 01:04.374
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:09.310 --> 01:10.829
Do you like
this dress, George?

01:10.967 --> 01:13.176
It's great.
Great.

01:14.971 --> 01:16.283
Well, how about
this one?

01:16.421 --> 01:18.147
Fantastic.

01:20.666 --> 01:24.153
Uh, well, maybe
I should wear this.

01:24.291 --> 01:26.810
Yeah!
That would be nice on you.

01:28.605 --> 01:30.745
George!
I said it's nice!

01:32.471 --> 01:33.886
What's that supposed to be?

01:34.024 --> 01:35.992
I need your help.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.098
What do you want me to wear
to Lionel's wedding?

01:38.236 --> 01:39.582
Nothing.

01:41.135 --> 01:45.208
Well, okay, but it's going
to shock the minister.

01:45.346 --> 01:47.659
You know what I mean.
Anything's all right with me.

01:47.797 --> 01:49.074
I know what you mean,
all right.

01:49.212 --> 01:51.111
You mean you still
don't like the idea

01:51.249 --> 01:52.940
of Lionel marrying
Jenny Willis.

01:53.078 --> 01:54.942
I agreed to it,
didn't I?

01:55.080 --> 01:58.670
Sure. The same way you agreed
to go to the dentist.

01:58.808 --> 02:00.672
And don't forget to order
your suit for the wedding.

02:00.810 --> 02:02.018
I got plenty
of time.

02:02.156 --> 02:05.228
The wedding's only
a couple of weeks away.

02:05.366 --> 02:07.713
Yeah, but anything
could happen between
now and then.

02:08.921 --> 02:10.130
Like what?

02:10.268 --> 02:12.718
Well, Lionel could
come to his senses.

02:15.480 --> 02:19.484
George, for Lionel's sake,
try to be happy about
the wedding.

02:19.622 --> 02:20.588
Please?

02:20.726 --> 02:22.728
Okay, I'll be happy.
See?

02:24.592 --> 02:25.628
Good.

02:27.526 --> 02:31.358
Now, tell me honestly.
Which dress do you like best?

02:31.496 --> 02:32.876
The blue one.

02:33.601 --> 02:35.776
Thank you, George.

02:35.914 --> 02:38.019
There isn't a blue one!

02:39.297 --> 02:41.402
That's why I like it.

02:46.027 --> 02:47.201
Good morning.

02:47.339 --> 02:49.169
Hi, Mr. Bentley.
Come in.

02:49.307 --> 02:50.411
Thank you.

02:50.549 --> 02:52.689
What do you want?

02:52.827 --> 02:55.485
I've got something
for you, Mr. J.

02:55.623 --> 02:56.969
Something for me?
What is it?

02:57.107 --> 02:59.420
I haven't
the foggiest idea.

02:59.558 --> 03:02.112
How can you give me
something if you don't know
what it is?

03:02.251 --> 03:05.115
The postman popped this
into my mailbox by mistake.

03:05.254 --> 03:06.600
Oh. It's from
my lawyer.

03:06.738 --> 03:07.946
Just some papers
for the store.

03:08.084 --> 03:09.430
Oh!
What a coincidence.

03:09.568 --> 03:11.225
I just heard
from my lawyer too.

03:11.363 --> 03:13.365
Oh, nothing serious,
I hope.

03:13.503 --> 03:15.505
Oh, it was about
my will.

03:15.643 --> 03:18.750
Oh, I hate thinking
about wills and dying.

03:18.888 --> 03:21.615
Oh, no, I'm making out
what they call a living will.

03:21.753 --> 03:23.133
You see,

03:23.272 --> 03:25.895
I think a man's got a right
to die. Don't you, Mr. J?

03:26.033 --> 03:28.208
Only if he's been
tried and found guilty.

03:30.658 --> 03:33.351
I can't stand the thought
of my lying there paralyzed,

03:33.489 --> 03:36.802
my eyes staring vacantly
into space.

03:36.940 --> 03:39.909
Look, if you can't handle
your liquor, don't drink.

03:41.635 --> 03:44.638
Are you talking about people
being kept alive on machines?

03:44.776 --> 03:45.811
Exactly.

03:45.949 --> 03:47.054
So my living will states

03:47.192 --> 03:48.987
that if ever I am
in a hopeless condition,

03:49.125 --> 03:50.368
I'd rather be
taken off the machines,

03:50.506 --> 03:53.094
even if it hastens
the moment of death.

03:57.927 --> 04:00.136
I just wouldn't want
to be a vegetable.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.862
Don't worry
about it, Bentley.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.693
I'll be happy to come over
and pull your plug anytime.

04:05.831 --> 04:08.489
Thank you, Mr. J.
You're a true friend.

04:10.698 --> 04:12.666
Oh, I say,
what lovely dresses.

04:12.804 --> 04:14.702
Oh, they're for
Lionel's wedding.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.464
Which one
would you choose?

04:17.602 --> 04:20.639
Well, it would depend
on what shoes I was wearing.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.506
Oh!

04:26.438 --> 04:27.577
It's a funny thing,

04:27.715 --> 04:29.234
but my lawyer was just
talking about weddings

04:29.372 --> 04:31.650
and the sad case
of Mr. Heywood.

04:31.788 --> 04:33.307
Who's Mr. Heywood?

04:33.445 --> 04:35.861
He's this very poor
oral surgeon.

04:35.999 --> 04:37.587
That is, he's not
a poor surgeon.

04:37.725 --> 04:40.176
He's a very good surgeon
who lost all his money.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.971
Oh. How'd he do that?
Gambling?

04:42.109 --> 04:44.491
No. It was
the Heywood curse.

04:44.629 --> 04:46.493
What's
the Heywood curse?

04:46.631 --> 04:48.529
Mrs. Heywood.

04:50.151 --> 04:51.946
She took him
for everything he had.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.845
Poor guy must have been
a real sucker, then.

04:53.983 --> 04:55.950
He should have known what
she was before he married.

04:56.088 --> 04:58.746
Ah, but she seemed
such a sweet young thing.

04:58.884 --> 05:00.230
Yeah, that's
the worst kind.

05:00.369 --> 05:02.578
What do you mean,
"the worst kind"?

05:02.716 --> 05:05.166
You talk like
all women are gold diggers.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.859
Not all of them.
Some women marry poor guys.

05:07.997 --> 05:09.516
Like I did.

05:09.654 --> 05:10.586
That's right.

05:10.724 --> 05:12.173
And if I'd had
all my money then,

05:12.312 --> 05:13.727
I'd have looked
at you twice.

05:22.805 --> 05:23.840
What?

05:23.978 --> 05:26.049
Oh, just kidding,
Weezy.

05:28.569 --> 05:31.572
Of course, if Heywood
had listened to my lawyer,

05:31.710 --> 05:33.056
he'd still be
a rich man today.

05:33.194 --> 05:34.748
You mean he could
have stopped his wife

05:34.886 --> 05:36.059
from ripping him off?

05:36.197 --> 05:38.199
Certainly, by signing
a prenuptial agreement.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.270
What's a prenuptial
agreement?

05:40.409 --> 05:42.756
It keeps them
from going to bed together.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.861
No.

05:44.999 --> 05:46.242
It simply spells out
what will happen

05:46.380 --> 05:48.071
in the event
of a divorce,

05:48.209 --> 05:50.039
how much the lady
will get.

05:50.177 --> 05:52.766
Or rather how much
she won't get.

05:52.904 --> 05:54.250
Oh, that's cold.

05:54.388 --> 05:57.218
No, it ain't.
It's very cool.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.428
Yes, my lawyer thinks
it's hot stuff too.

05:59.566 --> 06:03.397
Of course, it can't
take away a woman's right
to claim support.

06:03.535 --> 06:06.573
But it can take away
her right to claim
seven cleaning stores.

06:06.711 --> 06:08.471
What are you talking about?

06:08.609 --> 06:09.576
Nothing, Weezy,
nothing.

06:09.714 --> 06:10.784
That's all
there is to it?

06:10.922 --> 06:12.441
All I do is
get her to sign

06:12.579 --> 06:13.959
one of those agreements
before she gets married?

06:14.097 --> 06:15.444
That's all.

06:15.582 --> 06:17.377
Thanks, Bentley!
It's been nice talking
to you.

06:17.515 --> 06:19.240
Pity you can't stay.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.173
Can't I?

06:21.311 --> 06:22.554
Well, toodle-pip.

06:22.692 --> 06:24.211
Same to you.

06:25.488 --> 06:27.628
I know what you
are up to, George.

06:27.766 --> 06:28.974
And I don't
like it.

06:29.112 --> 06:30.976
Don't you want me to be
happy about the wedding?

06:31.114 --> 06:32.288
Of course
I do.

06:32.426 --> 06:33.910
Well, the only way
I can be happy

06:34.048 --> 06:36.050
is if Lionel gets
Jenny to sign one
of those agreements.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.570
You'll only make him
mad and angry.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.883
My own son mad at me?
You got to be kidding!

06:41.021 --> 06:42.367
He'll be furious.

06:42.505 --> 06:44.334
Oh, yeah? How much
you wanna bet?

06:44.473 --> 06:46.198
Bet?

06:46.336 --> 06:47.959
Oh, okay, George.

06:48.097 --> 06:51.687
But not money.
Something more delicious.

06:53.343 --> 06:54.483
I got it.

06:54.621 --> 06:56.381
If Lionel
gets mad at you,

06:56.519 --> 06:58.659
you'll kiss
all the Willises

06:58.797 --> 07:02.249
and say how happy
you are to welcome
them into the family.

07:09.946 --> 07:11.776
Kiss all
the Willises?

07:13.191 --> 07:15.296
Jenny, Helen and Tom.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.919
Argh!

07:19.404 --> 07:21.233
Okay!
You got a bet.

07:21.371 --> 07:24.651
Good. This bet is going to be
right up your alley, George.

07:24.789 --> 07:26.411
Oh, yeah?
Why you say that?

07:26.549 --> 07:30.311
You've been trying
to kiss off the Willises
for years.

07:34.074 --> 07:35.282
Hi, Pop.

07:35.420 --> 07:37.249
Lionel! Hey!

07:37.387 --> 07:38.872
Good to see you, son!

07:39.735 --> 07:41.184
How about a little talk?

07:41.322 --> 07:43.704
I don't have much time.
I'm on my way up
to see Jenny.

07:43.842 --> 07:46.431
What a coincidence!
I was just thinking
about Jenny.

07:46.569 --> 07:47.846
You were thinking
about Jenny?

07:47.984 --> 07:49.020
Yeah!

07:49.158 --> 07:51.091
Hey, that's nice!

07:51.229 --> 07:52.920
Have you thought
about a divorce?

07:54.612 --> 07:56.061
Divorce?

07:56.199 --> 07:57.787
We're not even married yet.
I know.

07:57.925 --> 08:00.169
That's the best time
to think about it,
before it's too late.

08:00.307 --> 08:02.758
Where you
coming from, Pop?

08:02.896 --> 08:04.138
Look, Lionel.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.588
One of these days,

08:05.726 --> 08:07.521
your old man's
going to be leaving.

08:07.659 --> 08:08.833
You taking
a vacation?

08:08.971 --> 08:11.905
No. I mean
I'm going to die.

08:12.043 --> 08:13.803
Oh, hey, Pop,
are you sick?

08:13.941 --> 08:17.082
No! I don't mean
right now. I mean someday.

08:17.220 --> 08:19.222
Oh! Well, we all
got to go some time.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.603
That's right.

08:20.741 --> 08:22.329
And remember, one day,

08:22.467 --> 08:24.883
all of this
will be yours.

08:25.021 --> 08:26.644
Plus all of
our stores.

08:26.782 --> 08:28.646
Pop, why are you
talking like this?

08:28.784 --> 08:29.923
Because I want
to make sure

08:30.061 --> 08:31.476
you and Jenny get off
on the right foot.

08:31.614 --> 08:33.720
Okay. How?

08:33.858 --> 08:36.205
Well, for instance,
you could, uh,

08:36.343 --> 08:39.242
get her to sign one of
those prenuptial agreements.

08:39.380 --> 08:41.072
What?

08:41.210 --> 08:42.832
You know, so she can't
get her hooks

08:42.970 --> 08:44.869
on the Jefferson dough
when you get divorced.

08:45.007 --> 08:47.457
This is the dumbest,
rottenest thing that
you've ever sai...

08:47.596 --> 08:49.080
Shh! Hold it!
Don't get mad.

08:49.218 --> 08:50.460
What do you
expect me to get?

08:50.599 --> 08:51.703
We aren't done yet.

08:51.841 --> 08:53.602
Oh, yes, we are.

08:53.740 --> 08:54.672
Lionel!

08:54.810 --> 08:56.018
Just forget it,
understand?

09:01.023 --> 09:03.508
What was Lionel
shouting about?

09:03.646 --> 09:04.785
Shouting? Huh.

09:04.923 --> 09:06.822
Okay, if you don't want
to go to the movies,

09:06.960 --> 09:08.168
see if I care!

09:23.942 --> 09:25.081
Hi!
Hi.

09:25.219 --> 09:26.289
Nice...

09:27.808 --> 09:30.121
Was it something I said
or something you ate?

09:30.259 --> 09:31.432
What?

09:31.571 --> 09:34.366
Well, you got steam
coming out of your ears.

09:34.504 --> 09:35.609
Hey, what's
the matter?

09:35.747 --> 09:36.748
Look, Jenny,

09:36.886 --> 09:38.370
I don't want
to talk about it, okay?

09:38.508 --> 09:40.580
Okay.

09:40.718 --> 09:42.651
Hey, I saw the cutest
little outfit today...

09:42.789 --> 09:45.067
Do you know what he had
the nerve to ask me?

09:45.205 --> 09:46.206
Who?

09:46.344 --> 09:47.656
Well, my father,
of course.

09:47.794 --> 09:49.589
Jenny, why don't you
listen to me?

09:50.900 --> 09:52.246
Sorry.

09:52.384 --> 09:54.870
He wanted me to get you
to sign a premarriage
agreement

09:55.008 --> 09:57.804
to stop you from getting
your hands on my money.

09:57.942 --> 09:59.978
Oh, but you don't have
any money.

10:01.670 --> 10:03.464
He means his money
after he's dead.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.226
Jenny, that man
makes me so damn mad.

10:06.364 --> 10:07.641
Oh, come on.

10:07.779 --> 10:11.093
It's just another one
of your father's dumb ideas.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.379
He should know
I wouldn't sign such an
agreement like that anyway.

10:21.517 --> 10:22.587
Of course
you wouldn't,

10:22.725 --> 10:24.900
because I'd never
ask you to sign one.

10:25.038 --> 10:27.454
Mmm. I wouldn't
even if you did ask me.

10:27.592 --> 10:29.076
You're right.

10:29.214 --> 10:31.700
I'm getting angry
over nothing.

10:34.875 --> 10:37.982
What do you mean,
you wouldn't sign it
even if I did ask you?

10:39.431 --> 10:41.330
Well, just that!

10:41.468 --> 10:42.676
But it doesn't matter,

10:42.814 --> 10:44.402
because you're not
going to ask me, right?

10:44.540 --> 10:45.679
Right.

10:45.817 --> 10:47.267
But only because
I wouldn't ask.

10:47.405 --> 10:49.131
Not because
you'd tell me not to ask.

10:50.132 --> 10:51.927
What?

10:52.065 --> 10:54.964
I mean, the man
in the marriage decides
these things.

10:55.620 --> 10:58.796
Oh!

10:58.934 --> 11:01.730
Oh, does that mean I have to
do whatever you say,

11:01.868 --> 11:03.663
Mr. Macho?

11:03.801 --> 11:06.320
It means if your husband
asks you to do something,

11:06.458 --> 11:09.151
you ought to have
enough faith in him to do it.

11:09.289 --> 11:12.257
But what if he asks me
to do something stupid?

11:12.395 --> 11:13.431
Well, if you loved
him enough,

11:13.569 --> 11:15.157
you wouldn't think
it was stupid.

11:16.365 --> 11:18.574
And I should obey him,
just like that?

11:18.712 --> 11:20.300
Just like that.

11:20.438 --> 11:23.406
Well, I'm not going to sign
your stupid agreement.

11:23.544 --> 11:24.994
Because I'm
not asking you to.

11:25.132 --> 11:26.927
But if I'd asked you
to sign it,

11:27.065 --> 11:30.034
I have a right to expect you
to trust me and to sign.

11:30.172 --> 11:31.552
Oh, no, no!
Uh-uh.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.762
You don't have any rights
over this girl.

11:34.797 --> 11:36.937
I mean,
I'm not a puppet.

11:37.075 --> 11:38.249
I'm not
your puppet now

11:38.387 --> 11:40.423
and I won't be your puppet
when we're married.

11:40.561 --> 11:42.805
So go find some other
strings to pull.

11:42.943 --> 11:44.807
Okay, then you don't
have to marry me

11:44.945 --> 11:46.188
just because
I asked you.

11:46.326 --> 11:48.638
That suits me fine.

11:48.777 --> 11:50.295
Then the wedding's off?

11:50.433 --> 11:51.434
Yeah, it's off!

11:51.572 --> 11:52.919
Okay, yeah!

11:57.682 --> 11:58.925
Jenny, what's going on
in here?

12:02.376 --> 12:04.482
Tom! Tom!

12:24.916 --> 12:26.918
I thought you said
there was trouble.

12:28.092 --> 12:30.680
There sure was
the last time I saw.

12:32.372 --> 12:34.236
Hi, Jenny!
Is everything all right?

12:34.374 --> 12:35.858
Fantastic!

12:36.825 --> 12:38.447
Am I going crazy?

12:38.585 --> 12:40.552
A minute ago, you were in here
practically hysterical.

12:40.690 --> 12:42.520
Yeah, I was
feeling down.

12:42.658 --> 12:44.522
But I feel
all right now.

12:46.593 --> 12:48.422
Jenny, I don't
understand this.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.734
Oh, come on,
Mama.

12:49.872 --> 12:52.116
Come on, now,
get down.

12:52.254 --> 12:54.152
Uh, look, Jenny,
your mother told me
you were crying

12:54.290 --> 12:56.396
as though your heart
was breaking.

12:56.534 --> 13:00.641
Well, you know how
Mama likes to exaggerate.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.058
Come on, Pop,
get down.

13:05.163 --> 13:06.233
Exaggerate?

13:06.371 --> 13:07.545
I did not exaggerate.

13:07.683 --> 13:09.719
Something was going on
between you and Lionel.

13:12.205 --> 13:15.622
Yeah, well, uh,
nothing much.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.314
We had a disagreement,
that's all.

13:18.452 --> 13:20.282
That's all?

13:20.420 --> 13:23.388
Yeah, but we came to
an understanding.

13:23.526 --> 13:26.150
You see, Helen,
there's no problem.

13:27.358 --> 13:29.498
What kind
of understanding?

13:34.468 --> 13:36.436
Jenny, what kind
of understanding?

13:36.574 --> 13:38.679
The wedding
is off.

13:40.474 --> 13:42.062
What?

13:43.823 --> 13:44.927
Look here, Jenny.

13:45.065 --> 13:47.171
Tom, will you
stop dancing!

13:48.379 --> 13:50.519
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:50.657 --> 13:52.245
She said
the wedding is off.

13:52.383 --> 13:54.212
What?

13:54.350 --> 13:56.318
How can you act
so calm?

13:56.456 --> 13:58.182
Well, it ain't
no big thing.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.149
We called it off, that's all.
You can't!

14:00.287 --> 14:01.185
Helen, let me handle this.

14:01.323 --> 14:02.738
But, Tom...
I mean it, Helen.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.360
This is no time
for female hysterics.

14:04.498 --> 14:05.879
You know how emotional
you get.

14:06.017 --> 14:07.225
You can't even
think straight.

14:07.363 --> 14:09.745
What we need here
is a calm, rational approach.

14:09.883 --> 14:12.299
Tom, she...
Helen, please.

14:15.682 --> 14:17.304
Tom...
Thank you, Helen.

14:22.482 --> 14:25.830
Now, Jenny,
I'm your father
and I love you.

14:25.968 --> 14:27.176
You know that, don't you?

14:27.314 --> 14:28.591
Yeah.

14:28.729 --> 14:31.180
And you know
I'd do anything
to help you.

14:31.318 --> 14:32.561
Yes.

14:32.699 --> 14:34.390
You want to tell me
what happened?

14:34.528 --> 14:36.565
No.

14:36.703 --> 14:38.636
Oh.

14:38.774 --> 14:40.638
All right,
let me put it this way.

14:40.776 --> 14:43.089
I'm your father
and you're my daughter,

14:43.227 --> 14:45.608
and you're gonna tell me
what happened, or else!

14:45.746 --> 14:47.645
Oh, Daddy...

14:47.783 --> 14:50.993
Lionel and I
are through.

14:51.131 --> 14:52.132
That's all.

14:52.270 --> 14:54.031
I personally think
I'm very lucky

14:54.169 --> 14:56.619
that I found out
that he was...

14:56.757 --> 14:59.933
Dad, I feel terrible.

15:00.071 --> 15:03.040
Oh, honey, honey. Oh.

15:03.178 --> 15:04.904
Oh, please don't cry.

15:05.042 --> 15:07.699
I... I can't stand
to see you cry.

15:07.837 --> 15:10.116
I can't help it.

15:11.324 --> 15:13.809
I didn't mean
to upset you.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.501
But it's...
It's not you.

15:16.639 --> 15:19.125
Oh, yes, it is.

15:19.263 --> 15:20.540
I come in here
to help you

15:20.678 --> 15:21.886
and I'm no help
at all.

15:22.024 --> 15:24.164
I start shouting
and demanding.

15:24.302 --> 15:27.443
Oh, God,
I'm a lousy father!

15:33.242 --> 15:35.072
Daddy, please, don't.

15:35.210 --> 15:37.419
I can't help it.

15:38.799 --> 15:40.836
You're not
a lousy father.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.011
You're the best father
in the whole world.

15:43.149 --> 15:45.841
Well, Lord knows
I try.

15:48.050 --> 15:52.365
Believe me,
your just being here has
really helped me a lot.

15:52.503 --> 15:53.642
Thank you, Jenny.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.885
You've made me feel
a lot better.

15:58.785 --> 15:59.889
Daddy!

16:00.028 --> 16:01.132
Hmm?

16:01.270 --> 16:03.514
I thought you wanted
to hear what happened.

16:03.652 --> 16:06.034
Oh, of course.

16:06.172 --> 16:08.312
That's what I came
in here for.

16:08.450 --> 16:09.934
Oh, my dear,
what happened?

16:10.072 --> 16:13.903
Lionel. Lionel,
he started acting super-macho,
you know?

16:14.042 --> 16:16.665
"I'm the man
and you're the woman,

16:16.803 --> 16:18.839
"so if I say you do it,
you do it."

16:18.978 --> 16:21.428
Well, I told him I don't want
that kind of marriage.

16:21.566 --> 16:22.602
I don't blame you.

16:22.740 --> 16:24.224
That doesn't sound
like Lionel.

16:24.362 --> 16:25.605
How did all this start?

16:25.743 --> 16:28.470
I told him I wouldn't sign
a prenuptial agreement.

16:28.608 --> 16:29.919
A prenuptial agreement?

16:30.058 --> 16:31.645
Yeah, that's that contract
you sign...

16:31.783 --> 16:32.992
Oh, I know
what it is, dear.

16:33.130 --> 16:34.994
Where did he get
that idea from?

16:35.132 --> 16:37.375
BOTH:
His father!

16:38.307 --> 16:39.791
I might've known.

16:39.929 --> 16:41.172
I might've known!

16:41.310 --> 16:43.036
George Jefferson would be
at the bottom of this.

16:43.174 --> 16:45.521
Well, this time
he's gone too far!

16:45.659 --> 16:47.006
You hear me, Jenny?
Too far!

16:47.144 --> 16:48.697
Okay, calm down.
You're getting angry.

16:48.835 --> 16:49.905
I am not angry.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.700
When I get angry,
my nostrils flare.

16:51.838 --> 16:53.426
Do you see
my nostrils flaring?

16:53.564 --> 16:57.085
Yeah, I can see
clear up to your sinuses.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.949
Then it's out
of my control.

17:00.088 --> 17:03.401
For three years I've taken
all that man's insults.

17:03.539 --> 17:04.609
All the stupid
honky jokes!

17:04.747 --> 17:05.817
But no more!

17:05.955 --> 17:07.681
I've had it.
You hear me? I've had it!

17:07.819 --> 17:10.270
But, Daddy, you said you were
gonna be calm and rational.

17:10.408 --> 17:11.961
I am calm
and I am rational!

17:12.100 --> 17:14.654
Don't tell me I'm not
rational, damn it!

17:14.792 --> 17:16.242
Ow!

17:16.380 --> 17:17.864
Oh-oh! Ow!

17:18.002 --> 17:19.797
Helen! Helen! Ohh!

17:19.935 --> 17:21.143
Helen.
What happened?

17:21.281 --> 17:22.731
I think my foot's broken.

17:22.869 --> 17:24.664
Oh-oh.
How'd you do that?

17:24.802 --> 17:27.011
I didn't do it,
George Jefferson did it.

17:47.273 --> 17:48.550
Will you stop
all that blowing?

17:48.688 --> 17:50.172
You're making waves
in my soup.

17:53.451 --> 17:55.177
I don't understand you,
George.

17:55.315 --> 17:58.836
Lionel and Jenny
have broken up,
and you just sit there.

17:58.974 --> 18:01.873
What do you want me to do,
stand up and eat my soup?

18:02.011 --> 18:05.118
If you keep
talking smart,

18:05.256 --> 18:07.189
you're gonna take
a swim in that soup.

18:08.259 --> 18:10.123
What do you want
from me, Weez?

18:10.261 --> 18:12.194
The wedding is off!

18:12.332 --> 18:14.058
Aren't you gonna do
anything about it?

18:14.196 --> 18:15.646
Sure I am.

18:15.784 --> 18:18.235
I'm gonna cancel
my wedding suit
and save me 300 bucks.

18:20.651 --> 18:21.721
See you later.

18:21.859 --> 18:24.103
Lionel, aren't you
gonna eat something?

18:24.241 --> 18:25.621
I'm not hungry.

18:25.759 --> 18:26.898
Uh, wait. Wait.

18:27.036 --> 18:30.764
Uh, shouldn't we
talk a little more?

18:30.902 --> 18:32.697
Ma, there's nothing more
to talk about.

18:32.835 --> 18:35.838
I mean,
Jenny and I are through
and that's it.

18:35.976 --> 18:38.047
I still can't understand it,
Lionel.

18:38.186 --> 18:39.980
How could you
break up a marriage

18:40.119 --> 18:42.328
over something you weren't
gonna do in the first place,

18:42.466 --> 18:44.157
over a silly "maybe"?

18:44.295 --> 18:45.538
Ain't nothing silly
about "maybe,"

18:45.676 --> 18:46.849
because you never know

18:46.987 --> 18:48.679
when a "maybe" is gonna turn
into a sure thing.

18:48.817 --> 18:51.302
You are not making sense.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.855
Oh, yes, I am.

18:52.993 --> 18:55.306
Remember the day
when you said,
"Maybe I'm pregnant,"

18:55.444 --> 18:56.583
and I said that was silly?

18:56.721 --> 18:58.758
Well, didn't that "maybe"
turn into Lionel?

19:01.209 --> 19:03.866
Well, there's no "maybe"
about him now.

19:04.004 --> 19:06.628
He's acting just as crazy
as his father.

19:06.766 --> 19:08.043
Oh, now,
look, Ma...

19:08.181 --> 19:09.458
I mean,
you may as well face it,

19:09.596 --> 19:11.357
Jenny and I are through
and that's it.

19:11.495 --> 19:13.945
Couldn't you go up
and tell Jenny
you are sorry?

19:14.083 --> 19:16.120
After all...
No! She broke it off!

19:16.258 --> 19:17.570
Now, why doesn't she
come to me?

19:17.708 --> 19:19.951
After all,
I've got my pride.

19:20.504 --> 19:22.782
Pride, huh?

19:22.920 --> 19:26.303
You try sleeping with that
for the rest of your life.

19:27.545 --> 19:28.960
Don't be meddling, Weezy.

19:29.098 --> 19:31.342
Lionel's a big boy now.
Just let him live
his own life.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.827
Not until I talk
some sense into him.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.071
You've talked enough
already!

19:36.209 --> 19:37.866
Now no more talking,
and that's it.

19:42.491 --> 19:43.527
That's it?

19:43.665 --> 19:44.907
Just like that?

19:45.045 --> 19:46.254
Just like that,

19:46.392 --> 19:49.153
because I am your husband
and what I say goes.

19:49.291 --> 19:51.362
Oh, really?

19:51.500 --> 19:52.777
GEORGE:
You better believe it,
woman!

19:52.915 --> 19:57.886
LOUISE: I told you
never to call me "woman!"

19:58.024 --> 20:00.095
GEORGE: Didn't you hear
what I said?

20:00.233 --> 20:01.510
I said no more
talking about it!

20:03.650 --> 20:05.445
Lionel? He's gone.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.136
What do you expect
when you don't listen to me?

20:07.275 --> 20:08.724
You drove him
out of the house.

20:12.763 --> 20:13.971
Jenny.

20:14.109 --> 20:15.766
Don't talk to me.

20:16.905 --> 20:19.010
I have to talk to you.

20:19.148 --> 20:21.116
Well, I don't
have to listen.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.635
Neither do I.

20:25.879 --> 20:28.088
Look, Jenny,
I just wanna say one thing.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.711
I was wrong.

20:29.849 --> 20:32.092
Now, look,
just because you've got me
stuck in an elevator

20:32.231 --> 20:33.715
doesn't mean that I have...

20:34.612 --> 20:35.648
Uh...

20:37.684 --> 20:39.824
Did you say
you was wrong?

20:39.962 --> 20:44.243
Please, I'm in a hurry.
I'm meeting
my wife downstairs.

20:44.381 --> 20:45.865
Sir, this is
very important.

20:46.003 --> 20:47.315
Our whole lives
depend on it.

20:47.453 --> 20:49.317
Well, how long will it take
to fix your lives?

20:49.455 --> 20:51.767
Because my wife doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

20:53.321 --> 20:55.461
Not very long.

20:55.599 --> 20:57.877
Jenny, you know all that stuff
I said upstairs

20:58.015 --> 20:59.361
about the husband
being the boss

20:59.499 --> 21:00.569
and making
all the decisions?

21:00.707 --> 21:02.088
Forget it.

21:02.226 --> 21:04.504
From now on, we're gonna make
all our decisions together.

21:04.642 --> 21:06.195
Equal partners all the way.

21:07.093 --> 21:09.026
What made you
change your mind?

21:09.164 --> 21:11.856
I just saw the future,
and it didn't work.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.824
What?

21:13.962 --> 21:17.690
Well, um, let's just say my
father opened my eyes for me.

21:18.518 --> 21:20.900
Oh, wasn't that
nice of him?

21:22.488 --> 21:23.903
But, I mean,
aren't you afraid

21:24.041 --> 21:25.801
you're not gonna get your way
when we're married?

21:25.939 --> 21:28.010
I'd rather have my woman
than my way.

21:35.190 --> 21:36.743
Lionel...

21:40.851 --> 21:42.577
I'm sorry. Your wife.
No!

21:42.715 --> 21:44.095
Let her wait.

21:53.208 --> 21:54.934
Why you all picking on me?
It ain't my fault.

21:58.662 --> 22:01.216
Who do you think you are?
J. Paul Getty?

22:01.354 --> 22:05.358
If you think that my daughter
is after your money, you're...

22:05.496 --> 22:07.084
Did you see
what I saw?

22:13.815 --> 22:15.713
What happened?
Are you...

22:15.851 --> 22:16.783
Are you...

22:16.921 --> 22:18.820
The wedding is on again.

22:18.958 --> 22:20.580
Oh, wonderful.
Good.

22:23.307 --> 22:25.344
Yeah, we realized
it was a silly argument.

22:25.482 --> 22:27.449
But we are gonna sign
a prenuptial agreement.

22:27.587 --> 22:29.417
You are?
Why?

22:29.555 --> 22:30.728
Because it isn't
a bad idea.

22:30.866 --> 22:32.454
You hear that?

22:32.592 --> 22:35.043
Now maybe some people
will shut up before
they start talking.

22:35.181 --> 22:37.597
We haven't gotten it
written down yet,

22:37.735 --> 22:39.219
but we've already decided
on the main points.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.393
That's my boy.

22:40.531 --> 22:42.430
First, we're gonna
respect each other.

22:42.568 --> 22:44.224
And we're gonna
trust each other.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.157
And we're gonna try
and live our lives

22:46.295 --> 22:48.090
without telling others
how to live theirs.

22:53.993 --> 22:54.959
Is that it?

22:55.097 --> 22:56.271
That's it.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.548
What about the money?

22:57.686 --> 22:59.274
Hey, drop it, Pop.

22:59.412 --> 23:02.173
Now, I don't wanna blow
my top again like
I did this afternoon.

23:02.311 --> 23:03.727
But...

23:03.865 --> 23:06.557
Sure.
Forget I even mentioned it.

23:06.695 --> 23:09.042
Not so fast.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.837
Did I hear right, George?

23:10.975 --> 23:13.599
Lionel got mad when you
brought up that agreement?

23:13.737 --> 23:15.842
I almost went
through the roof.

23:17.706 --> 23:20.847
Oh, well, in that case...

23:20.985 --> 23:23.263
George, don't you have
something to do?

23:23.402 --> 23:25.404
Oh, Weezy.

23:31.202 --> 23:32.687
Now.

23:38.934 --> 23:41.972
I just wanna say
I'm happy to welcome
you all into the family.

23:45.216 --> 23:46.494
Oh, thank you.

23:46.632 --> 23:47.702
Oh, George...

23:47.840 --> 23:49.773
Let's just get this
over with, okay?

23:52.431 --> 23:53.777
Okay, Weezy?

23:53.915 --> 23:55.606
Not quite, George.

24:09.206 --> 24:11.208
That's it!
That's as far as it goes.

24:39.823 --> 24:44.068
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
was videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
