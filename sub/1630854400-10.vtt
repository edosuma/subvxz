18:22.927 --> 18:24.320
for something big.

18:26.061 --> 18:26.235
.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.368
- Tell me about Sean Connery.

18:28.411 --> 18:29.804
Is he as handsome in person
as he is on screen?

18:29.847 --> 18:32.850
- You have to be very secure
about your own face

18:32.894 --> 18:34.243
to stand next to Connery.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.419
And he gave me great advice.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.639
Got me thinking
about my future,

18:38.682 --> 18:40.945
and I wanna get
your opinion on it.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.730
- You wanna become an actor.

18:42.773 --> 18:45.646
- No. I don't wanna act.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.865
I want to start my own
wrestling promotion.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.519
- Thank God because Lia
would not be okay

18:49.563 --> 18:50.912
with you doing love scenes.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.696
- She would murder me.
- It'd be a slow death.

18:52.740 --> 18:53.958
- She'd savor it.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.134
- She could handle
the jail time too.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.613
Wouldn't be afraid of it.

18:56.657 --> 18:59.442
- She'd come out stronger,
tougher, ready to remarry.

18:59.486 --> 19:03.533
But I really think I can base
the promotion out in Hawaii

19:03.577 --> 19:07.276
and build a roster
of Polynesian wrestlers.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.800
We can play heel, babyface.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.541
It doesn't matter.

19:11.585 --> 19:15.676
We don't have to be
just one thing.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.808
- I love that.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.201
You got a name for it?

19:19.245 --> 19:21.464
- Polynesian Pacific
Pro Wrestling.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.814
- Ah, alliteration.
Always works.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.294
- After a few years,

19:25.338 --> 19:28.123
my grandfather started
Polynesian Pro Wrestling.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.429
Peter Maivia
accomplished things

19:29.472 --> 19:31.518
that no one who looked
like him achieved

19:31.561 --> 19:33.041
in the wrestling business,

19:33.084 --> 19:35.696
and my grandfather taught me
there were no limits

19:35.739 --> 19:38.002
to what a half-Black,
half-Samoan kid

19:38.046 --> 19:40.701
with big dreams could achieve

19:40.744 --> 19:42.703
because we don't
have to be just one thing.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.705
And I'd like to think
to this day,

19:44.748 --> 19:46.533
I live by that lesson.

19:46.576 --> 19:47.882
- Bonjour, Pat.

19:47.925 --> 19:50.537
- André!  Mon ami!

19:50.580 --> 19:52.191
Peter, this is my friend André.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.975
I invited him
to join us for a drink.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.977
- Of course, brother.
Have a seat.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.326
- Oh.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.372
Um, maybe just stand.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.243
- [laughs]

20:02.984 --> 20:05.334
- You know, I still can't
get over how good this is.

20:05.378 --> 20:06.857
- Care for a third?

20:06.901 --> 20:08.555
- Prime minister, are you
trying to get me caffeinated?

20:08.598 --> 20:10.948
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]

20:12.994 --> 20:15.736
- I am sorry for surprising you
in front of the press

20:15.779 --> 20:17.216
with my statement.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.913
Part of it was me
just trying to divert

20:18.956 --> 20:20.915
attention away from that
mountain-naming issue.

20:20.958 --> 20:24.266
But I do believe
in what I said.

20:24.310 --> 20:28.749
Protecting Gjeljish coffee is
a core belief in my country.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.403
- I completely understand that.

20:30.446 --> 20:31.926
But with your plentiful crop,
do you think that there's a--

20:31.969 --> 20:34.189
- But the land is finite.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.540
And the attention
and care required is crucial.

20:37.584 --> 20:41.849
It's not just the land
or the technique or the people.

20:41.892 --> 20:44.460
It's all of it, Dwayne.

20:44.504 --> 20:47.115
It's all of it together.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.944
Gjeljians like my father,
they lived

20:49.987 --> 20:51.424
to make our coffee special,

20:51.467 --> 20:56.951
so I won't be the one
to compromise their vision.

20:56.994 --> 20:58.648
- I'm not surprised
to hear you say that.

20:58.692 --> 20:59.954
- Thank you.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.304
- And now I see why
you can't make the deal.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.784
And I respect that.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.264
- It's unfortunate, though,

21:05.307 --> 21:09.137
that you came all this way
for a no.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.313
But I really enjoyed
our time together.

21:11.357 --> 21:13.533
- So have I, and hey, look,
I have the high score

21:13.576 --> 21:14.577
on your "WrestleFest" game,

21:14.621 --> 21:15.839
so I'm going home
with a victory.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.754
- Ah, actually, two.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.495
You inspired me
to find a compromise

21:19.539 --> 21:20.975
for that mountain-naming issue.

21:21.018 --> 21:23.412
- Okay. I'll take two wins.
- There you go.

21:23.456 --> 21:24.892
- So what
was the compromise?

21:24.935 --> 21:26.241
- A name that
was sitting there

21:26.285 --> 21:29.679
just staring us in the face
the whole time.
