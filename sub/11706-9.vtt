{\an8}WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW?"

08:55.201 --> 08:57.245
{\an8}[laughing]
I'M SO STRESSED OUT RIGHT NOW.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.758
{\an8}- ME AND THIS TOILET
IS LIKE A BOXING MATCH.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.385
{\an8}LIKE, WE KEEP GOING

12:09.979 --> 12:11.313
{\an8}- WELL, I TAKE IT BACK.
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.649
{\an8}- I TAKE IT BACK.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.860
{\an8}I'M SO PISSED THAT I [bleep] UP

{\an8}- DON'T FEEL BAD.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.490
{\an8}WAS THE SEX GOOD?

12:21.574 --> 12:22.783
{\an8}- NO, WASN'T EVEN WORTH IT.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.702

13:00.571 --> 13:02.364
{\an8}- I'M OVER VINNY.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.657
{\an8}- SHE'S MAD AT ME.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.242
{\an8}- VINNY REALLY

13:05.326 --> 13:07.369
{\an8}HE'S THE ONE THAT ALWAYS
BRINGS HOME GRENADES.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.538
{\an8}SO I'M DOING ME.
HE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.873
{\an8}- NICOLE!

13:10.956 --> 13:13.626
{\an8}- CAN'T HEAR YOU.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.181
{\an8}- I WAS WRONG FOR EVERYTHING.

13:27.264 --> 13:29.225
{\an8}- I ALWAYS KNEW WHAT I HAD,
AND, LIKE, YOU DIDN'T.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.769
{\an8}- IF SHE COMES BACK, I CAN'T BE
IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HER.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.438
{\an8}- HE'S GONNA TRY

13:36.482 --> 13:38.192
{\an8}IT'S CRAP, AND YOU KNOW IT.

13:38.275 --> 13:39.235

13:56.001 --> 13:57.753
{\an8}- YOU'RE A JERK.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.588
{\an8}- YOU'RE MEAN.
- I'M NOT MEAN.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.382
{\an8}- THERE'S DEFINITELY
A DOUBLE STANDARD IN THE HOUSE.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.926
{\an8}VINNY CAN HOOK UP
WITH ALL THESE GRENADES,

14:04.009 --> 14:05.803
{\an8}BUT IF I BRING HOME GUYS
AND ONLY SLEEP WITH ONE OF THEM,

14:05.886 --> 14:08.722

{\an8}- DON'T BE MEAN TO ME LIKE THAT.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.691
