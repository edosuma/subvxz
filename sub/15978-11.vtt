WEBVTT

00:05.439 --> 00:06.374
(sighs)
Hmm.

00:06.407 --> 00:09.210
I feel like I have
an unfair advantage over you

00:09.243 --> 00:11.745
since I grew up in a house
that was falling apart.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.517
Nathan, we've got
a problem.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.220
Yeah, Mom, it's tragic that
they're turning the Yarn Barn

00:19.253 --> 00:21.555
into a Starbucks, but I am not
gonna spend another weekend

00:21.589 --> 00:24.692
in a crocheted poncho chanting,
"Are we gonna fight?

00:24.725 --> 00:26.327
You're gosh yarn right."

00:26.360 --> 00:29.197
This is bigger
than that.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.332
Debbie's having money problems,
and she's worried

00:31.365 --> 00:33.701
about the future of her
and Adam's yoga café.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.704
Yeah, of course she is.
The café is meat-free,

00:36.737 --> 00:39.440
gluten-free and customer-free.

00:39.473 --> 00:43.344
(chuckles)
I had their
seaweed smoothie once.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.679
First time I ever had a drink
that tasted better coming up.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.715
(chuckles)

00:47.748 --> 00:50.084
Yeah, well, anyway, she-she
hasn't mentioned anything

00:50.118 --> 00:52.553
about it to me.
She hasn't mentioned
it to anyone.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.054
Then how do you know about it?

00:55.289 --> 00:56.590
Oh, no, Mom, no. Come on.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.192
When Debbie turned 18, we vowed

00:58.226 --> 01:00.128
that we'd never read
her diary again.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.295
You read her diary?

01:01.329 --> 01:02.663
That's a sin!

01:02.696 --> 01:04.265
At school, I wouldn't
even read Anne Frank's

01:04.298 --> 01:07.235
because she didn't give me
permission!

01:08.602 --> 01:12.306
Look, Ray, I promise,
we only ever did it to help her.

01:12.340 --> 01:16.144
When she was eight, she cried
a lot but wouldn't tell us why,

01:16.177 --> 01:18.312
so I bought her a diary

01:18.346 --> 01:19.513
that had a secret key,

01:19.547 --> 01:22.383
the secret being
that I had another copy.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.517
Hmm.

01:23.551 --> 01:24.518
And that's how I learned

01:24.552 --> 01:26.487
that she was wetting the bed.
And like a good

01:26.520 --> 01:28.822
older brother,
I wet my bed, slept in it,

01:28.856 --> 01:31.492
and in the morning Mom told the
whole family it was no big deal.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.661
You spent the night in pee?!

01:35.929 --> 01:37.831
Why didn't you just pour
some water on the bed

01:37.865 --> 01:39.467
after you woke up?

01:40.734 --> 01:44.372
Nobody likes a Monday morning
quarterback, Ray.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.440
Anyway, according to her diary,

01:46.474 --> 01:49.410
Debbie's thinking about selling
her diamond necklace.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.513
Wait. The one she inherited
from Great Nana Ruth?
Yes.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.449
Come on, Nathan.
Debbie needs us.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.851
Well, I guess I could convince
my boss to do a story

01:57.885 --> 02:00.688
about healthy living.
We could feature Debbie's café.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.423
Be like a free commercial.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.491
Perfect!

02:03.524 --> 02:04.825
But before I go,

02:04.858 --> 02:07.127
the secret pledge.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.766
(sighs)

02:12.800 --> 02:14.635
CAROL AND NATHAN:
If family's in trouble,

02:14.668 --> 02:16.237
we're there on the double.

02:16.270 --> 02:21.342
Mother and son combine as one.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.746
Should've kept that a secret.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.797
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

02:51.705 --> 02:53.674
Hey, guys. Hey, Dad.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.843
DEBBIE AND ADAM: Hey.
Hey, listen, uh,
can you do me a favor?

02:55.876 --> 02:57.845
I'm doing a story
on healthy living, and I need

02:57.878 --> 02:59.880
to feature a place
that has food and exercise.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.350
Are you serious?
I mean, being on the news

03:02.383 --> 03:04.985
is like free publicity. We could
really use that right now.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.854
Wow. Here I was thinking
that you were doing me a favor,

03:06.887 --> 03:08.989
but if it helps all of us,
even better. Great. Okay.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.424
Uh, I guess
we'll just ask you guys

03:10.458 --> 03:11.992
a couple questions
about the café.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.595
Wait. Hold on a second. Wait.
We're gonna be on TV? Okay.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.730
Should I do glasses
or no glasses? All right.

03:16.764 --> 03:20.000
I'll be sexy.
Smart. Sexy. Smart.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.871
Sexy. (groans)
Oh, man!

03:23.904 --> 03:26.240
That Great Nana Ruth's necklace?

03:26.274 --> 03:29.009
Look at it, around your neck,
where it should always be.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.845
Hmm. Yeah. Hey, I'm gonna get
Adam's Whispering Frog costume.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.014
Do you think there's a way
we can work our slogan in,

03:34.047 --> 03:35.949
"come for the yoga,
namaste for lunch"?

03:35.983 --> 03:38.986
Sure. Anything to take the focus
off the food.

03:43.891 --> 03:44.925
Hey, Tom.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.327
Playing yourself in chess, huh?

03:46.360 --> 03:47.528
Who's winning?

03:47.561 --> 03:49.563
Too early to tell.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.601
He is.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.937
You should bring some
of your buddies down here.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.472
I think they could use
the business.

03:58.506 --> 03:59.807
I don't really have
a lot of buddies.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.942
At my age, all the decent men
either get swept up

04:01.975 --> 04:03.911
by women or God.
Well,

04:03.944 --> 04:06.447
if you're looking for a friend,
there's a guy in my building,

04:06.480 --> 04:08.949
Walter. Real cool cat.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.952
He's divorced like you, dapper,
listens to jazz.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.754
I don't know much about jazz.

04:13.787 --> 04:17.758
I did watch a jazzercise class
once, and I...

04:17.791 --> 04:22.496
I remember enjoying that
an uncomfortable amount.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.798
Great!

04:24.832 --> 04:26.467
There's jazz in the park
every Saturday.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.868
The three of us should go.

04:27.901 --> 04:28.669
Sounds good.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.404
Uh, listen, uh...

04:30.438 --> 04:32.940
Ray, do you mind not telling
Nathan you're setting me up?

04:32.973 --> 04:35.843
He'll tell Carol.
It'll be a nightmare.

04:35.876 --> 04:39.079
What are you talking about?
Well, Carol
always teased me for...

04:39.112 --> 04:41.349
being awkward around people,
claimed that...

04:41.382 --> 04:43.984
she was the only reason
we had any friends.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.654
So, anyway, if she finds out
you're having to set me up,

04:46.687 --> 04:49.523
she'll know she was right.
I'll never hear the end of it.

04:49.557 --> 04:52.726
It'll be like that-that time
I got Krazy Glue on my hand.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.061
Mmm.
I reached down
to scratch my...

04:55.095 --> 04:57.064
I just don't want
to hear about it.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.666
Yeah.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.970
So if you Leesburgers
are looking for something

05:03.003 --> 05:04.805
other than cheeseburgers,

05:04.838 --> 05:08.308
well, the Whispering Frog
Yoga Café h...

05:10.878 --> 05:13.581
...has a healthy list
of daily specials

05:13.614 --> 05:16.450
all made
from organic ingredients.

05:16.484 --> 05:20.120
Like their slogan says,
come for the yoga and...

05:20.153 --> 05:22.055
And come for the yoga.

05:22.089 --> 05:26.059
She means "and namaste
for lunch."

05:26.093 --> 05:27.861
And come for
the yoga.

05:27.895 --> 05:30.664
It's great. I love it.
(doorbell rings)

05:30.698 --> 05:33.133
Can't believe they aired it
four times today.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.936
Thank you
so, so much. Oh!

05:35.969 --> 05:38.071
Business was great today.
We got to do that thing

05:38.105 --> 05:39.873
where you take money
to the bank.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.676
Anyway, here's a little token
of our appreciation.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.613
Adam turned some leftover mung
beans into thank you muffins.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.515
Oh, great. I'll just...
I'll put these in the kitchen.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.049
(sniffs)
Inside some Tupperware.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.051
(sniffs)
Inside more Tupperware.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.020
(sniffs)
Inside my garbage.

05:54.522 --> 05:57.157
Debbie, I'm so glad business
is booming.
Yeah, thanks.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.460
I mean, Nathan's the best.
Well, you know
what they say.

05:59.493 --> 06:02.596
Behind every good man is a
good woman. Usually his mother.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.765
Okay, I got to go.
Thanks again, Nate!

06:04.798 --> 06:06.700
Uh, Debbie, with all those
new customers running around,

06:06.734 --> 06:08.035
you may want to tuck your

06:08.068 --> 06:10.404
great-grandmother's
necklace into your shirt.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.973
That's a family heirloom
we should never be without.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.612
It's just I wear
this necklace all the time,

06:18.646 --> 06:20.481
no one says anything about it,
and then suddenly

06:20.514 --> 06:22.983
both Mom and Nathan
mention it?

06:23.016 --> 06:24.885
Did you tell them we were
thinking of selling it?

06:24.918 --> 06:26.554
Did I tell your family,
who still wishes

06:26.587 --> 06:28.155
you had married
that lawyer Richard,

06:28.188 --> 06:30.157
that we may have to sell
a precious heirloom

06:30.190 --> 06:32.560
in order to save
our failing business?

06:32.593 --> 06:34.462
No, I did not.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.063
Well, if you didn't say
anything, I mean...

06:36.096 --> 06:39.132
Adam.

06:39.166 --> 06:43.070
I think Mom and Nathan
might be reading my diary.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.572
(knocking)
Hey.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.106
Is this too much?

06:46.139 --> 06:48.509
I want to make some friends,
so Ray is setting me up

06:48.542 --> 06:49.643
with a guy in his building.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.779
Oh. Well, that's nice.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.514
Just don't tell your mother,
but Ray said this guy

06:53.547 --> 06:55.048
is very dapper,
and I want to impress him,

06:55.082 --> 06:57.050
so I've been digging deep
in my closet.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.086
How 'bout this?

07:01.121 --> 07:04.592
Dad, is that from Mikayla's
Girl Scout uniform?

07:04.625 --> 07:08.161
Damn it! I hate all my clothes!

07:08.195 --> 07:10.631
(chuckles)
You know, if I didn't
know any better,

07:10.664 --> 07:13.934
I'd think your dad has
a crush on this guy.
(chuckles)

07:14.968 --> 07:17.938
What if you read it
in my diary?

07:17.971 --> 07:19.439
Would you believe it then?

07:19.473 --> 07:22.175
Why would you write it...
Listen, if Mom and Nathan
are reading my diary,

07:22.209 --> 07:24.578
they're never gonna admit it.
But if I put something fake

07:24.612 --> 07:26.514
in it, you know,
maybe I could trap 'em.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.248
Okay, wait a second.
You don't actually think

07:28.281 --> 07:30.718
you can convince Nathan and
your mom that your dad is gay,

07:30.751 --> 07:32.052
do you?
(knocking)

07:32.085 --> 07:34.988
Mikayla's doll had
some clip-on earrings.

07:35.022 --> 07:38.626
Does this make me look as cool
as Harrison Ford?

07:38.659 --> 07:40.928
Cooler, Dad.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.500
I'll get a pen.
I'll get my diary.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.617
What?

08:03.651 --> 08:07.821
I was reading
Debbie's diary again.

08:07.855 --> 08:11.559
And...?

08:11.592 --> 08:13.193
And...

08:13.226 --> 08:17.531
we might be going
to a lot more parades.

08:28.108 --> 08:31.011
Wait, you're telling me
that Dad is gay?

08:31.044 --> 08:33.013
That's what Debbie wrote.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.015
Well, maybe
she just misunderstood. I mean,

08:35.048 --> 08:37.017
maybe he was just agreeing
with her about something.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.219
He has a really weird way
of saying "okay."

08:39.252 --> 08:41.589
"Mmm-kay."

08:41.622 --> 08:43.523
Kind of sounds like "I'm gay."

08:44.958 --> 08:46.994
"Mmm-kay?" "I'm gay."

08:47.027 --> 08:49.029
"Mmm-kay."

08:49.062 --> 08:50.130
"I'm gay."

08:50.163 --> 08:53.200
"Debbie, I need
to tell you something.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.770
Mmm-kay?"

08:56.804 --> 09:00.307
Listen, when I read it, it was
hard for me to believe, too.

09:00.340 --> 09:05.946
But now, thinking back, I can't
deny that there were signs.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.081
He was always primping
in the bathroom,

09:08.115 --> 09:10.083
almost as bad as you.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.953
Hey. I got carded buying beer
last Friday,

09:12.986 --> 09:14.955
so whatever I'm doing
is worth it.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.990
You know what? Your father was

09:17.024 --> 09:19.292
always a little awkward trying
to make friends with other men.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.895
I used to make fun of him,
but I never realized

09:21.929 --> 09:25.098
he might've been sizing them up
for sex.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.767
Oh, come on.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.035
Dad's awkward with everybody.

09:28.068 --> 09:31.104
He spent 45 minutes talking to
Tommy Lee Jones at a wax museum.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.644
It all makes sense now.

09:36.677 --> 09:39.780
All the years of fighting,
his impatience with me.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.982
This is why our marriage
fell apart.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.785
Ah! I feel like a weight
has been lifted.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.920
He wasn't divorcing me.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.690
He was divorcing
his heterosexuality.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.792
(chuckles)
Wait,

09:51.825 --> 09:53.093
you're actually giddy
about this.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.028
You want him to be gay,
don't you?

09:55.062 --> 09:56.964
I won't deny
that there are upsides,

09:56.997 --> 09:58.632
not just for me.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.801
When he falls asleep
on the couch after dinner,

10:00.834 --> 10:02.736
he deserves to be with someone
who is strong enough

10:02.770 --> 10:05.372
to carry him up the stairs.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.040
I'm gonna call
and tell him it's okay.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.810
No, no, Mom. Stop it. Stop it.
No, no, no. Come on. Look.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.211
There's no way that Dad is gay.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.946
Besides, if you just ask him,
Debbie's gonna know

10:12.980 --> 10:14.147
that we've been reading
her diary.

10:14.181 --> 10:17.851
Oh, fine. Debbie invited us over
for that thank you dinner.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.119
We'll just dig
around then.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.188
Oh, I thought
of another sign.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.224
During sex,
when he called out my name,

10:24.257 --> 10:25.959
I swear, sometimes
instead of "Carol,"

10:25.993 --> 10:29.062
he was saying "Carl."

10:29.096 --> 10:32.065
Wait, wait. Wait a second.
That was sex?

10:32.099 --> 10:34.001
I used to hear Dad through
the wall and just thought

10:34.034 --> 10:35.268
he was on the phone
with a guy named Carl

10:35.302 --> 10:38.305
who was taking a long time
to finish something.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.713
Come on down, Dad!

10:45.746 --> 10:48.048
Let's see how you look!

10:48.081 --> 10:51.151
Are you sure you bought me
the right shirt for tonight?

10:51.184 --> 10:53.420
Do guys really dress like this?
(vehicle approaching)

10:53.453 --> 10:55.789
Sure. Yeah. Certain guys do.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.057
Yeah.
(car doors shut outside)

10:57.090 --> 10:58.959
Oh, that must be Ray
with my new friend.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.397
Oh, no, no. No, no.
It's-it's Carol and Nathan.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.999
What are they doing here?

11:06.033 --> 11:08.068
Dad-Dad, just tell her
you're going to a jazz concert

11:08.101 --> 11:10.370
with a friend, okay? She doesn't
need to know anything else.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.973
She won't ask
and you don't tell.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.343
Nathan, Mom,

11:16.376 --> 11:17.344
hey, come on in.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.979
You guys remember Dad.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.280
(door shuts)

11:20.313 --> 11:23.483
Hi, Tom. Uh,
cute outfit.

11:23.516 --> 11:28.088
Looks like you wrapped a
rainbow all around you.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.290
Well, a guy gets older,
he wants to experiment,

11:30.323 --> 11:31.324
try new things.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.996
Stop acting so surprised,
mmm-kay?

11:38.398 --> 11:40.901
What-what did you say?

11:40.934 --> 11:43.270
(timer dings)
Oh, that's my quinoa casserole.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.173
Just chat amongst yourselves.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.108
So? Did they read
your diary or what?

11:48.141 --> 11:49.877
Shh, shh.
We'll know in a minute.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.012
CAROL:
So, is there, um,

11:52.045 --> 11:54.147
a reason you're
all dressed up?

11:54.181 --> 11:56.083
I'm going out to meet a friend

11:56.116 --> 11:58.986
whom I met on my own.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.453
And that's all
you need to know.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.222
Okay, Tom.

12:02.255 --> 12:05.158
I'm sure your friend's
gonna love the outfit,

12:05.192 --> 12:07.160
although--
a little word of advice

12:07.194 --> 12:08.228
from one diva to another--

12:08.261 --> 12:11.398
those pants scream out
for a lighter color shoe.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.067
Damn it! I hate
all my shoes!

12:16.103 --> 12:19.206
I can't believe it.
A gay in the family.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.540
This is so exciting.

12:20.573 --> 12:24.812
I wonder if we'll get
to go on Elton John's boat.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.279
Just...

12:26.313 --> 12:29.449
calm down. Debbie's diary
could still be wrong.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.084
That's it. I'm gonna kill 'em!

12:31.118 --> 12:33.220
They're about to make fools
of themselves. Please, Debbie.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.355
They have enjoyed ten years
of me doing stupid things.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.924
Let me just enjoy this. Please.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.827
Ray.
Oh.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.228
I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.497
Hi. I'm Walter.
Here to pick up Tom.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.399
Hi. I'm Carol.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.069
And I want to encourage
you and Tom to have

12:49.102 --> 12:53.874
a great time together, no matter
where the night takes you.

12:53.907 --> 12:57.277
Just be safe.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.981
I brought a raincoat,
just in case.

13:05.252 --> 13:08.055
Confident.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.857
TOM:
Hey, Ray!

13:09.890 --> 13:11.258
Good to see you
guys inside.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.126
When I was clearly yelling
from the window

13:13.160 --> 13:15.062
that I'd meet you at the curb.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.030
Hi, Tom.
Hey.

13:17.064 --> 13:20.433
I'm Walter. This group I'm gonna
introduce you to tonight

13:20.467 --> 13:24.037
is amazing. There's this
one dude called Golden Lips.

13:24.071 --> 13:28.108
You're gonna love
the way he blows.

13:32.212 --> 13:37.084
I don't know. He's pretty
particular about that.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.086
Okay. This is gonna be fun.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.088
I'm so glad Ray hooked us up.

13:41.121 --> 13:44.291
Great. Well, Carol,
I guess my secret is out.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.592
I'm sure you're thrilled.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.127
Well, judge all you want.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.329
So what if Ray set me up
with a guy?

13:49.362 --> 13:51.264
I couldn't meet one on my own.

13:51.298 --> 13:54.301
I can only play solo chess
for so long.

13:55.602 --> 13:58.371
I've never heard that euphemism
before, but I just...

13:58.405 --> 14:01.308
I just want you to know
that we understand.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.176
I guess you must've been
playing solo chess

14:03.210 --> 14:05.545
the whole time we were married.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.247
It's not like I could play
with you.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.183
You don't even know
where the pieces go.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.252
I know where they go, Tom.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.387
I just don't have the one
you're looking for.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.356
(whispers):
The penis.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.094
Excuse me?

14:21.128 --> 14:22.295
Because you're gay.

14:22.329 --> 14:23.363
Who's gay?

14:23.396 --> 14:24.898
He's gay.
I'm gay?

14:24.932 --> 14:25.899
You didn't tell me
he was gay.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.067
I didn't know he was gay.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.036
Who told you I was gay?

14:29.069 --> 14:30.270
Mom told me you were gay.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.538
Why did you think I was gay?

14:31.571 --> 14:33.273
Because she read it

14:33.306 --> 14:35.342
in my diary!

14:35.375 --> 14:37.911
I made it up as a test,
and she failed.

14:37.945 --> 14:41.481
Debbie, how dare you lie
to me in your diary!

14:41.514 --> 14:45.118
Oh! But my deepest, darkest
secrets are in that book!

14:45.152 --> 14:47.120
How dare you invade
my privacy like that!
(ding)

14:47.154 --> 14:48.188
Ooh, it's
the quinoa casserole!

14:48.221 --> 14:50.657
This isn't over!
(grunts)

14:50.690 --> 14:53.226
Well.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.627
Well, Walter...
(chuckles)

14:54.661 --> 14:56.663
now you've met the Millers.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.608
Okay, yes, we read your diary.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.443
But we only did it
to help you out.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.245
Oh, well, here's
some news for you.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.446
I don't need your help.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.949
(both laugh)

15:15.983 --> 15:16.950
Excuse me?

15:16.984 --> 15:18.418
Debbie, if we hadn't stepped in,

15:18.451 --> 15:20.954
you would've sold the necklace
and been miserable.

15:20.988 --> 15:23.223
Just like you'd been
miserable if we'd let you

15:23.256 --> 15:24.691
stay ashamed of
wetting the bed.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.361
You knew about that?

15:28.395 --> 15:30.397
Come on,
we know about everything.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.100
I mean, we're the reason you
didn't smoke pot with Skunky.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.702
Or get that boob job so you
could look like Jessica Rabbit.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.506
You're welcome.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.475
For what?
Manipulating my entire life?

15:42.509 --> 15:44.177
No, not your entire life.

15:44.211 --> 15:45.578
We stopped when you were 18.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.547
But I think we all know
how that turned out.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.051
What do you mean by that?

15:51.084 --> 15:52.185
My life is great.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.720
Sweetheart, you drive a car

15:53.753 --> 15:55.955
with a beanbag as a backseat.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.158
Let's face it.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.759
Your last ten years
would've gone better

15:59.792 --> 16:01.694
if all your life decisions
had been made

16:01.728 --> 16:05.298
by a drunk monkey
using a Magic 8 Ball.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.666
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.302
Debbie and I met and got married
in the last ten years.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.537
Do you consider me a mistake?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.539
Am I a drunk monkey decision?

16:12.572 --> 16:14.441
Yeah, Mom.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.310
Do you consider the husband
I love to be some awful choice?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.779
Not awful, no.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.448
But if I'm being honest...

16:21.481 --> 16:22.549
No, please don't.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.485
If I'm being honest,
I was always a little surprised

16:25.518 --> 16:28.155
that you broke up with Richard
and started dating Adam.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.089
Mom!
I knew it.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.390
Richard was in law school.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.324
Adam worked
in the grocery store.

16:31.358 --> 16:32.325
I'm a mother.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.560
These are the laws of nature.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.095
It's not personal.

16:35.128 --> 16:35.962
I told you!

16:35.995 --> 16:37.497
See, I knew your family
never liked me.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.366
At our wedding,
your mother had a seating chart

16:39.399 --> 16:40.667
that had you and me
at different tables.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.236
CAROL: I wanted you near
the emergency exit.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.605
You're so big, I was worried

16:45.638 --> 16:47.207
you would trample people
if there was a fire.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.641
DEBBIE: He's not
a giant, Mom!

16:48.675 --> 16:51.311
My Aunt Ethel weighs 85 pounds.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.180
If she got caught
under one of his shoes,

16:53.213 --> 16:55.215
she would shatter
into a million pieces.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.618
She'd be like a puzzle
in a bag of skin.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.387
Okay, enough, Carol.
We get it.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.521
You never would've chosen me.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.623
No.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.126
I chose you.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.427
BOTH: What?

17:07.460 --> 17:09.196
Mom, I lied.

17:09.229 --> 17:12.699
After you moved,
I read Debbie's diary... alone.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.168
Debbie had been
really upset lately

17:15.202 --> 17:16.403
and she wouldn't tell me
what was wrong,

17:16.436 --> 17:19.106
so I had no choice
but to snoop again.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.208
DEBBIE:
Dear Diary,

17:21.241 --> 17:23.443
Richard brought me to his
family's Thanksgiving today.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.745
Since it was a holiday,
he let me have a dessert.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.447
But only after I promised

17:27.480 --> 17:30.617
to split it with the trashcan.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.552
That doesn't sound
like the Richard I knew.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.221
Yeah, well, it was.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.622
Just entry after entry,

17:35.655 --> 17:37.390
he treated Debbie
like a doormat.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.692
And then I read this.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.595
DEBBIE:
We went
to the grocery store today,

17:42.629 --> 17:45.398
and Richard was up
to his normal tricks

17:45.432 --> 17:48.135
when I saw him again.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.703
Adam.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.639
Rocking the sexiest set

17:52.672 --> 17:54.741
of male pigtails
I've ever seen.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.543
Not only is he handsome,

17:56.576 --> 17:59.379
but he's as graceful
as a gazelle.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.148
NATHAN:
She went on for eight pages.

18:01.181 --> 18:04.417
And I could tell she really
cared about this Adam.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.519
So I had to see him for myself.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.521
Luckily, even though I was
in my early 30s,

18:08.555 --> 18:10.423
I could easily blend in
with the kids

18:10.457 --> 18:12.459
who hung out at the store.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.728
* And the darkness
inside you... *

18:15.762 --> 18:18.198
As I watched Adam,
I learned

18:18.231 --> 18:19.199
that he was kind to old people.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.733
* I see your true colors

18:20.767 --> 18:22.535
* Shining through

18:22.569 --> 18:25.338
* I see your true colors

18:25.372 --> 18:27.174
He was kind to young people.

18:27.207 --> 18:30.410
* That's why I love you

18:30.443 --> 18:31.578
* So don't be afraid

18:31.611 --> 18:34.181
* To let them show

18:34.214 --> 18:36.683
* Your true colors

18:36.716 --> 18:40.287
* True colors

18:40.320 --> 18:43.590
He was even kind to old people
pretending to be young people.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.593
* Like a rainbow

18:46.626 --> 18:48.228
Behind the overalls

18:48.261 --> 18:50.663
and ineffective
organic deodorant,

18:50.697 --> 18:51.798
he was a great guy.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.900
I knew that was the kind of guy

18:53.933 --> 18:56.203
who would make my sister happy,
so I decided

18:56.236 --> 18:58.605
I had to help
Debbie bag this bagger.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.672
* Don't be afraid...

18:59.706 --> 19:03.176
You know how you met Adam
at that yoga retreat?

19:03.210 --> 19:04.611
Yeah, it was fate.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.645
We couldn't believe
that we both got

19:05.678 --> 19:08.448
randomly selected to go
by Q106's morning show

19:08.481 --> 19:10.450
with Johnny Cranks
and, uh, Pirate Bob.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.352
(as Pirate Bob):
Ahoy there, lucky listener.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.553
If you're feeling flexible,

19:13.586 --> 19:15.588
today's

19:15.622 --> 19:18.625
your...

19:24.597 --> 19:27.367
...lucky day!

19:27.400 --> 19:29.569
Oh, my God.

19:29.602 --> 19:30.470
You were the one who called?

19:30.503 --> 19:33.406
Yar, that be true.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.642
I paid for you guys
to go on that yoga retreat

19:35.675 --> 19:39.212
'cause I wanted to see...

19:39.246 --> 19:40.780
I wanted to see
if it was meant to be.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.615
(quiet laugh)

19:42.649 --> 19:45.585
And I guess it was meant to be.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.654
Because nine months
after that yoga retreat,

19:47.687 --> 19:48.721
I had a niece.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.591
* And that's why I love you.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.859
I always thought
you didn't like me

19:52.892 --> 19:55.562
because I wasn't good enough
for your sister.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.397
No, Adam, I love you.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.233
'Cause you've made
her smile more than...

20:00.267 --> 20:02.235
well, more than we ever have.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.903
Nathan, that's so sweet.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.872
Thank you.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.674
Adam, I'm sorry.

20:07.707 --> 20:11.544
I see now that you're
the perfect man for my daughter.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.680
And I'm sorry I made you
cut your pigtails

20:13.713 --> 20:14.814
before the wedding.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.849
(laughs)
Come here.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.561
Debbie, I promise that we'll
never read your diary again.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.830
Although you should probably
find a new hiding spot.

20:30.863 --> 20:31.831
We'll see.

20:31.864 --> 20:32.865
It's kind of nice

20:32.899 --> 20:34.567
having superheroes
watch over me.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.603
Shall we?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.042
BOTH:
If family's in trouble,

20:43.075 --> 20:44.677
we're there on the double.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.479
Mother and son

20:46.513 --> 20:48.681
combine as one.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.688
Good God, your family
is so cool!

20:55.722 --> 20:55.788
