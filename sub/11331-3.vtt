<i>Previously on The Secret
Life of the American Teenager...</i>

00:02.836 --> 00:03.971
If Amy and Ricky got married,

00:04.005 --> 00:05.806
I am really going
to be upset with you.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.705
Why? Why me?
Be upset with them

00:07.825 --> 00:08.876
if you want to be
upset with anyone.

00:08.910 --> 00:10.110
It's just that I'm not ready to

00:10.144 --> 00:12.846
go back to my house
and confront everyone.

00:12.881 --> 00:14.815
Part of the reason
I wanted to elope was

00:14.849 --> 00:17.744
because I'm tired of everyone
being involved in our business.

00:17.864 --> 00:20.797
They were roasting marshmallows
over a Bunsen burner.

00:20.917 --> 00:22.856
What?
And an hour later, boom,

00:22.891 --> 00:25.692
the lab blows up
and the school burns down.

00:25.727 --> 00:28.729
I can't keep dating Jack
to get information.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.931
I don't love him.
I don't love him at all.

00:30.965 --> 00:32.165
Is Amy okay?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.935
I think maybe she and
Ricky eloped last night.

00:34.969 --> 00:36.069
...to talk.

00:36.104 --> 00:38.071
Ben! Ben!

00:38.106 --> 00:40.841
You think you're going to
hell because we kissed?

00:40.875 --> 00:42.175
<i>Is that why you're</i>
<i>a Christian again?</i>

00:42.210 --> 00:44.745
That might have
something to do with it.

00:44.779 --> 00:46.780
Ashley, do you remember that cooking
school you applied to in Italy?

00:46.814 --> 00:47.881
Yeah?
No!

00:47.916 --> 00:49.049
You got accepted.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.784
No, you can't go to Italy.
You don't have any money.

00:50.818 --> 00:51.985
And you're not giving her any.

00:52.020 --> 00:53.153
We...

00:56.190 --> 00:57.991
...got married.

01:00.929 --> 01:02.930
Ricky on a stick?

01:02.964 --> 01:04.831
Ricky on a stick?

01:05.700 --> 01:07.100
Ricky on a stick.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.169
Ricky on a stick.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.041
Ricky on a stick?

01:14.075 --> 01:15.809
Rick on a stick?

01:15.843 --> 01:16.910
Ricky on a stick?

01:16.945 --> 01:18.712
Rick on a stick?

01:18.746 --> 01:19.980
Ricky on a stick?

01:20.014 --> 01:21.048
Rick on a stick?

01:21.082 --> 01:22.082
Ricky on a stick.

01:26.788 --> 01:30.157
I'm so happy for you
and Ricky and John!

01:30.191 --> 01:32.993
Congratulations,
Mrs. Underwood!

01:33.027 --> 01:36.797
Thank you. Um, it's not
that big of a deal though.

01:36.831 --> 01:38.699
We were living
together, you know.

01:38.733 --> 01:40.934
Hi, Amy! Congratulations.

01:40.969 --> 01:42.936
I wanted to give you
this gift from me.

01:42.971 --> 01:45.872
It's the book on which
your vows are based.

01:48.076 --> 01:49.142
Thanks, Grace.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.111
I just thought
you should have it,

01:51.145 --> 01:53.180
'cause you know it is the
foundation for a good marriage.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.881
Very nice.

02:01.089 --> 02:04.091
Amy! Amy! Wait up!

02:04.125 --> 02:06.093
We heard the good news!
You got married!

02:06.127 --> 02:07.694
Finally, huh?

02:07.929 --> 02:09.863
Yeah, finally.

02:09.896 --> 02:12.833
Um, I guess that's for me?

02:12.867 --> 02:14.067
Who do you think it's for?

02:14.102 --> 02:17.704
Yeah, well, thanks.

02:17.739 --> 02:19.706
That's a very
large wedding cake.

02:19.741 --> 02:22.075
My mom insisted on making it,
she owns a bakery, you know.

02:22.110 --> 02:25.012
Yeah, I know.
And how sweet of her.

02:25.046 --> 02:27.781
And how sweet of the two of
you to bring it in for me.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.116
I really didn't know
anything about it.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.084
Hey, how are you? I heard
you were in the hospital.

02:31.119 --> 02:33.754
How am I?
Who cares how I am?

02:33.788 --> 02:35.756
If you had cared how I am,

02:35.790 --> 02:39.026
you would have called me to tell
me that you got married yourself.

02:39.894 --> 02:41.795
So, I guess...

02:41.829 --> 02:44.164
Good luck to you.
Have a nice life.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.171
You keep the top layer
and then freeze it.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.940
Yeah.

02:53.975 --> 02:55.842
Ben, are you all right?
Ricky on a stick?

02:55.877 --> 02:58.011
No. I'm not.

02:59.781 --> 03:00.781
Do you need to talk to Alice?

03:00.815 --> 03:02.649
No, I don't need
to talk to Alice!

03:04.686 --> 03:06.820
He's kind of having
an anxiety attack.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.956
But it has nothing to do with you.
Congratulations!

03:09.991 --> 03:11.658

I heard there's going to be some
kind of low class flash mob.

03:40.822 --> 03:42.789
Yeah. I was hoping
to get in on it,

03:42.824 --> 03:44.825
but I didn't have
time to work on it.

03:44.859 --> 03:46.026
It's pretty intense.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.061
It's pretty pathetic.

03:55.103 --> 03:57.738
We're so
excited for you!

03:57.772 --> 04:00.040
Yeah, and don't worry about us not
getting to see you get married,

04:00.074 --> 04:01.641
just as long as you're happy.

04:01.676 --> 04:02.943
What are you so dressed up for?

04:02.977 --> 04:04.611
And why did you
change your hair?

04:04.645 --> 04:06.947
Oh. Um...
You know what they say,

04:06.981 --> 04:08.882
blondes have more fun.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.852
Okay, see you, Amy.

04:11.886 --> 04:13.887
I think she's had enough fun.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.623
Bye! Congratulations!

04:16.656 --> 04:17.958
What is going on?

04:22.830 --> 04:25.665
Congratulations! We're
practically in-laws now, right?

04:25.700 --> 04:28.602
Yeah. I guess we are.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.836
See ya later, sis.

04:29.871 --> 04:31.705
Yeah, see you later,

Good morning.

09:11.852 --> 09:12.986
Come on, tell me.

09:13.445 --> 09:15.279
Tell you...
I already know.

09:15.314 --> 09:17.181
Know?
You're married!

09:17.216 --> 09:19.283
Oh. That. Yeah.

09:19.318 --> 09:21.219
You big knucklehead!
You're supposed to ask the girls

09:21.253 --> 09:23.521
to marry you in private
and get married in public.

09:23.555 --> 09:26.123
Yeah, well, you're supposed to get
married before you have the kid,

09:26.158 --> 09:27.458
but we like doing
everything backwards.

09:27.493 --> 09:28.493
As long as you're happy.

09:28.527 --> 09:31.062
We're happy.
Congratulations.

09:31.096 --> 09:32.396
Oh, you heard, huh?

09:32.431 --> 09:34.398
I heard. Eloped, huh?

09:34.433 --> 09:35.500
If that's what
you call it, yeah.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.235
I'll let you two talk.

09:39.271 --> 09:43.207
Your mom sent this.
It's a little gift for you and Amy.

Insurance forms?

Amy and John
on your insurance with us.

09:49.314 --> 09:51.115
Medical and dental.
Really?

09:51.149 --> 09:54.252
Yeah. That's wife.
And your son.

09:54.286 --> 09:58.155
And I know Amy
at the church nursery,

09:58.190 --> 09:59.457
but it's not
like this insurance.

09:59.491 --> 10:01.125
This'll take care
of everything.

10:01.159 --> 10:03.561
Oh. Yeah.
This is great. Thanks.

10:03.595 --> 10:05.296
I want to wish you
all the best.

10:05.330 --> 10:07.164
That's really nice of you, Leo.

10:07.199 --> 10:09.267
I really appreciate
everything you've done for me,

10:09.301 --> 10:10.568
the job, the apartment.

10:10.602 --> 10:13.204
You've been to the staff here,

10:13.238 --> 10:17.275
and it's nice to see
my family's old apartment,

10:17.309 --> 10:20.311
nice to see it
come back to life.

10:20.345 --> 10:23.314
And here.
Have a little something for you.

10:29.388 --> 10:30.555
I can't take this.

10:30.589 --> 10:33.124
It's for you and Amy,
a little something to get you started.

10:33.158 --> 10:35.493
This looks like
to get us started.

10:35.527 --> 10:37.228
Leo, this is way too generous.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.330
Just say "thank you."
Thank you.

10:39.364 --> 10:44.402
It's a rare thing to find
loyal, honest young man.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.138
You did a good thing,
in marrying Amy.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.543
So, when are classes starting?

10:52.578 --> 10:54.278
I've got another
couple of days.

10:54.313 --> 10:57.214
And what are you majoring in?
Business. I think.

10:57.249 --> 10:59.250
Sounds good to me. What are
you hoping to do with it?

10:59.284 --> 11:01.052
I'm not sure.

11:01.086 --> 11:03.521
I'd love for you to consider a
career at this company, my company.

11:05.390 --> 11:07.191
Feel free to
get more involved in

11:07.225 --> 11:10.061
whatever aspect of the
business that interests you.

11:10.095 --> 11:12.096
Maybe you want to
get a butcher's license,

11:12.130 --> 11:14.298
spend a little time
at the offices,

11:14.333 --> 11:17.501
maybe you want to check into the
international aspect of the business.

11:17.536 --> 11:19.170
What are you interested in?

11:19.204 --> 11:22.473
Mostly in not offending anyone
in your family. Like Ben.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.408
Don't worry about it.

11:24.443 --> 11:26.477
He and I have had this
conversation a hundred times.

11:26.511 --> 11:30.348
He has other ideas about what
he wants to do with his life.

11:30.382 --> 11:34.118
If you want a career here,
I'd love to have you.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.420
This is my business, not Ben's.

11:37.556 --> 11:40.491
So, think about it,

11:40.525 --> 11:43.094
think about whether or not
this is the place for you.

11:43.128 --> 11:44.195
Yes.

11:44.229 --> 11:45.396
You might want to
discuss it with your wife.

11:45.430 --> 11:47.198
All right,
I'll discuss it with Amy,

11:47.232 --> 11:49.433
but she already knows that I would
want to be in business with you.

11:49.468 --> 11:52.536
I've told her before, that would be the
best thing that could ever happen,

11:52.571 --> 11:54.472
if you wanted me to be a
part of this business.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.273
Happy to hear it.

11:56.308 --> 11:57.475
Thanks.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.477
So, we'll see you around.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.478
Are you sure about this?

12:04.182 --> 12:05.249
You wanted to see me?

12:05.283 --> 12:07.051
Hey, nice cake.

12:07.085 --> 12:08.486
Thanks.
You want a piece?

12:08.520 --> 12:10.254
Sure.

12:10.288 --> 12:13.057
I thought you and Ricky
on the fourth of July.

12:13.091 --> 12:15.226
We were, but then...

12:15.260 --> 12:17.528
I don't know, we just

12:17.562 --> 12:20.464
decided to do something else.

12:20.499 --> 12:23.134
This doesn't affect my going to school here
or anything, does it?

12:23.168 --> 12:24.435
No, not at all.

12:24.469 --> 12:28.139
It might if you two
here, but you're fine.

12:28.173 --> 12:30.474
This is all wonderful news,
your getting married.

12:30.509 --> 12:33.411
I mean, why have
a big wedding, right?

12:33.445 --> 12:36.147
It costs so much
money these days.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.416
Mmm. Good cake.

12:38.450 --> 12:41.352
Oh. Thanks.
Ben's girlfriend's mom made it.

12:41.386 --> 12:44.188
Which is a little weird
if you ask me, but anyway.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.323
The cafeteria lady
wouldn't let me leave it in the lunchroom.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.558
So, maybe you could...
Oh, no.

12:47.592 --> 12:50.194
No, it's too much
for my office.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.463
Plus I've got meetings all day.

12:52.497 --> 12:54.265
But, um, look,

12:54.299 --> 12:56.567
I wanted to talk to
you about something.

12:56.601 --> 12:59.170
This year, I'm asking
each of the seniors

12:59.204 --> 13:01.238
to mentor a freshman
coming into the school.

13:01.273 --> 13:02.339
Oh, that's a great idea.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.141
I'm glad you think so.

13:04.176 --> 13:06.077
I have a really special girl
I want you to meet.

13:06.111 --> 13:08.212
She just moved
into the neighborhood

13:08.246 --> 13:09.380
and she needs a lot of help.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.182
I have a son, you know.

13:11.216 --> 13:13.050
I'm not really up for taking on

13:13.085 --> 13:15.186
someone who needs
a lot of help, but...

13:15.220 --> 13:17.254
I think you're
for the job.son

13:17.289 --> 13:18.289
Kathy!

13:21.493 --> 13:24.395
Hey! Ooh. Cake!

13:38.341 --> 13:39.505
I can't believe you're married.

13:39.625 --> 13:43.279
Yeah.
Well, I am.

13:43.947 --> 13:46.297
Usually guys who knock you up
won't marry you, you know.

13:46.468 --> 13:47.235
I know.

13:49.775 --> 13:51.809
I don't like the
term "knocked up."

13:51.844 --> 13:53.544
What's wrong with "knocked up"?

13:55.022 --> 13:56.714
It just...

13:56.748 --> 13:59.450
It has "victim"
written all over it.

14:00.586 --> 14:02.520
I think it would be great
if women could stop

14:02.554 --> 14:04.896
seeing themselves
as victims so often

14:05.016 --> 14:07.325
and take responsibility
and control of their lives.

14:08.727 --> 14:11.462
I am a victim.

14:11.497 --> 14:14.365
Oh, my gosh.
I didn't realize.

14:14.733 --> 14:16.667
What, you were...

14:16.702 --> 14:17.735
Oh, geez, you were...

14:17.769 --> 14:20.538
No. No.

14:20.572 --> 14:24.575
I was talked into having unprotected
sex by my nerdy boyfriend

14:24.610 --> 14:27.645
who convinced me he had a foolproof
scientific birth control method,

14:27.679 --> 14:30.793
which depended on him stopping
at just the right time.

14:32.417 --> 14:33.384
I knew it didn't sound right.

14:33.418 --> 14:34.485
But you did it anyway.

14:34.553 --> 14:35.882
He was very persuasive.

14:36.002 --> 14:37.882
He made me want to do it,
you know what I mean?

14:39.013 --> 14:41.592
I'm giving the baby
up for adoption.

14:41.627 --> 14:43.701
I already found
a family for her.

14:43.995 --> 14:45.395
I don't want my life to be over

14:45.429 --> 14:48.375
just because my boyfriend wasn't
as smart as I thought he was.

14:49.133 --> 14:52.755
Look, I don't mind
talking to you,

14:53.674 --> 14:55.275
but I don't want
to be like you.

14:55.309 --> 14:57.210
My life isn't over.

14:57.245 --> 14:59.413
I'm finishing up high school,
I'm going to college, and...

14:59.447 --> 15:01.481
And you're 18 and married.

15:01.516 --> 15:03.150
To the guy who knocked you up.

15:10.391 --> 15:13.260
These are your favorite
cookies, you know.

15:15.163 --> 15:17.364
If you say so.

15:17.398 --> 15:20.167
I brought them all the
way back from Paris.

15:20.201 --> 15:21.201
Just for you.

15:21.636 --> 15:23.637
Well, aren't you nice.

15:25.606 --> 15:27.507
I love Paris.

15:29.277 --> 15:31.445
My husband and I used to
go there all the time.

15:35.349 --> 15:37.417
I need to tell you something.

15:38.653 --> 15:41.288
Something I should have
told you a long time ago.

15:41.322 --> 15:43.290
Oh, I know.

15:43.324 --> 15:45.425
You've lost your virginity.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.360
You're not fooling
anyone, you know.

15:47.395 --> 15:48.662
I know, Mom.

15:50.431 --> 15:54.167
I want to apologize to you

15:54.202 --> 15:55.502
for not including you
in my wedding.

15:56.671 --> 15:58.472
Oh, that's okay.

16:01.175 --> 16:02.442
You were at mine, though.

16:02.477 --> 16:03.477
What?

16:06.214 --> 16:07.414
Oh, nothing.

16:09.183 --> 16:12.486
There's something else
I need to tell you.

16:12.520 --> 16:16.256
Amy ran off and married Ricky.
They eloped.

16:20.328 --> 16:23.130
Oh, honey.

16:23.164 --> 16:24.598
Oh, honey, don't cry.

16:26.334 --> 16:29.369
And, Mom, there's something
else I need to tell you.

16:33.341 --> 16:34.508
I'm gay.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.376
Of course.

16:38.446 --> 16:41.181
Gay Paris.

16:41.215 --> 16:45.352
Oh, it's such a wonderful city.

16:45.386 --> 16:46.553
The City of Lights, you know.

16:46.587 --> 16:48.655
Yeah, that's the one.

16:50.324 --> 16:52.559
My husband loved Paris.

16:53.327 --> 16:54.427
Did I tell you that?

16:59.167 --> 17:01.368
Hey, Mom.
Hey, yourself.

17:01.402 --> 17:05.137
Heard from your bride
since she left for school?

17:05.173 --> 17:07.174
No. Why?

17:07.208 --> 17:10.377
Ethan planned a big surprise for
her in the hallway this morning.

17:10.411 --> 17:11.478
She loves surprises.

17:11.512 --> 17:13.346
Does she?
No, not at all.

17:13.381 --> 17:16.282
Well, she's probably
gonna love this one.

17:16.317 --> 17:18.151
What is it?
Oh, I'll let Amy tell you.

17:18.185 --> 17:21.188
Or show you. She probably
got it all on her phone.

17:21.222 --> 17:22.454
So you have the day off?

17:22.490 --> 17:24.491
I have the day off but I'm
working tonight at the clinic,

17:24.525 --> 17:26.126
you know I do that sometimes.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.294
When's Dad back?

17:27.328 --> 17:30.130
On Friday. And he can't
wait to see you.

17:30.164 --> 17:32.432
Why?
Why?

17:32.466 --> 17:35.235
Because you're married.
You're our married son.

17:35.269 --> 17:36.403
And we're very proud of you.

17:36.437 --> 17:39.139
Thanks.
You're welcome.

17:39.173 --> 17:42.175
Is that it?
No, that's not it.

17:42.210 --> 17:43.476
I have something for you.

17:43.511 --> 17:46.146
Oh. No. Don't give me anything.
You've done enough for me.

17:46.180 --> 17:47.581
And I've got to get over
to the campus bookstore.

17:47.615 --> 17:49.216
I want to pick up my books.

17:49.250 --> 17:50.383
I don't want to wait
till the last minute.

17:50.418 --> 17:55.388
These were my mother
and father's wedding bands.

17:55.423 --> 17:59.292
And I noticed that you and Amy
didn't have wedding bands, and...

17:59.327 --> 18:01.094
I can't take these, Mom.

18:01.128 --> 18:02.429
These have to have
a lot of sentimental value.

18:02.463 --> 18:04.097
What if we lost them
or something?

18:04.131 --> 18:06.366
You're not going to
lose your wedding band.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.235
And it would make me feel good

18:08.269 --> 18:11.338
to see the two of you wearing
my parents' wedding rings.

18:13.274 --> 18:17.177
Uh, but, you know, if you don't
want to wear them, that's fine.

18:17.211 --> 18:19.179
Oh, no, no, no. I didn't
mean to hurt your feelings.

18:19.213 --> 18:21.281
That's the last thing
in the world I want to do.

18:21.315 --> 18:22.490
You know me.

18:22.610 --> 18:25.418
I just feel guilty taking something
from you that's this important to you.

18:25.453 --> 18:30.457
You are far more precious to
me than any piece of gold.

18:32.226 --> 18:34.160
And now you're married!

18:40.074 --> 18:42.955
No offense, but I am not doing it.

18:43.195 --> 18:45.263
Unless it's a requirement
for graduation.

18:45.298 --> 18:46.386
And if it is,
I'm getting a lawyer.

18:46.506 --> 18:48.199
I don't think
you need a lawyer.

18:48.234 --> 18:50.593
And I doubt that there's
anything illegal about this.

18:50.893 --> 18:52.465
It's the new senior program.

18:52.576 --> 18:53.910
Each senior will
mentor a freshman.

18:53.944 --> 18:55.056
Not this senior.

18:55.176 --> 18:58.581
Ben, you went to summer school. You
don't have a heavy class load.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.416
You need to get
interested in something.

19:00.450 --> 19:01.751
Something other
than girlfriends.

19:01.785 --> 19:03.586
I am not the mentor type.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.969
I'm a senior in high
school and I'm divorced.

19:06.089 --> 19:07.314
Who needs that kind of mentor?

19:07.434 --> 19:09.525
You're also a guy who has
learned from his mistakes.

19:09.559 --> 19:10.860
No, I haven't.

19:10.894 --> 19:13.829
What was your first year like here?
I bet it wasn't easy.

19:13.864 --> 19:15.464
You can say that again.

19:15.499 --> 19:17.600
Well, that's what
this program's about.

19:17.634 --> 19:20.870
To make sure freshmen have an easier
time adjusting to high school.

19:20.904 --> 19:22.805
To make sure
we see trouble coming

19:22.839 --> 19:24.774
and do something about it
before it's too late.

19:24.808 --> 19:28.444
You're dreaming! I am not capable
of seeing trouble coming.

19:28.478 --> 19:29.679
That's how I keep
ending up in trouble.

19:29.713 --> 19:31.881
What do you mean? Are you in
some kind of trouble now?

19:31.915 --> 19:33.449
No!

19:33.483 --> 19:35.685
All right, Ben,
this is your senior year.

19:35.719 --> 19:37.820
This should be the best
year of high school.

19:37.854 --> 19:39.889
And no matter how bad
the other years were,

19:39.923 --> 19:41.590
this could be
a good year for you.

19:41.625 --> 19:42.725
Or not.

19:42.759 --> 19:44.493
Are you sure you're not
in some kind of trouble?

19:44.528 --> 19:45.728
No.

19:45.762 --> 19:47.863
No, you're not sure, or no,
you're not in any trouble?

19:47.898 --> 19:49.765
Both.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.534
And stop fishing for information
just because I don't want

19:51.568 --> 19:53.436
anything to do with
your little mentor program.

19:53.470 --> 19:54.637
Okay, well,

19:56.473 --> 19:58.641
why don't you take some
time to think about this

19:58.675 --> 19:59.742
and we'll talk again next week.

20:00.811 --> 20:02.645
Yes, why don't we?

20:08.518 --> 20:09.719
Oh. Excuse me.

20:09.753 --> 20:12.621
I was just going in there
to the counselor's office.

20:12.656 --> 20:13.689
What the hell
are you doing here?

20:13.724 --> 20:14.790
I'm teaching.

20:14.825 --> 20:16.659
I'm finishing up a
requirement for my master's.

20:16.693 --> 20:17.760
What?
Yeah.

20:17.794 --> 20:18.894
I'm teaching here
this semester.

20:18.929 --> 20:20.830
You have a thing for
young girls, don't you?

20:20.864 --> 20:22.765
Yeah, I knew it.
You're a pervert.

20:22.799 --> 20:23.866
What are you talking about?

20:23.900 --> 20:25.901
Adrian is only 18, you know.

20:25.936 --> 20:27.837
She's almost 19 and I'm 22.

20:27.871 --> 20:30.473
Yeah. Well, that makes her
three years younger than you.

20:30.507 --> 20:32.475
Look, pal, you just
stepped over the line.

20:32.509 --> 20:35.544
I'm not some kind of pervert just
because I'm dating your ex-wife.

20:35.579 --> 20:37.813
And you better not ever say
that within these walls again

20:37.848 --> 20:40.816
because that is a very serious accusation.
And I don't like it.

20:40.851 --> 20:42.551
Oh, yeah? What are you
going to do about it?

20:42.586 --> 20:44.820
Punch me?
Go ahead.

20:44.855 --> 20:47.623
I would risk getting arrested as well
as lose everything I've worked for

20:47.657 --> 20:49.825
at college for the past four
years just to punch you?

20:49.860 --> 20:51.627
Pervert.
All right, that does it.

20:51.661 --> 20:52.928
I'm going to
report you right now.

20:52.963 --> 20:54.864
I have no choice but
to report you right now.

20:54.898 --> 20:56.665
I want this on record.

20:56.700 --> 20:59.802
Otherwise your false accusations
could come back to haunt me.

20:59.836 --> 21:01.604
I want the authorities called.

21:01.638 --> 21:04.540
Oh. Oh, no. No. No authorities
need to be called.

21:04.574 --> 21:05.708
Yeah, they do.
Oh, come on.

21:05.742 --> 21:08.644
I just...
I momentarily lost my...

21:08.678 --> 21:10.880
My sanity, you know, thinking
about you and Adrian.

21:10.914 --> 21:12.848
You're divorced. You have
another girlfriend now.

21:12.883 --> 21:16.585
Not a good one. Look, I'm sorry.
I'm an idiot.

21:16.620 --> 21:19.488
I'm a little on edge.
It's the first day of school.

21:19.556 --> 21:21.557
And it's overwhelming.

21:21.591 --> 21:23.659
I take it all back.
All of it.

21:23.693 --> 21:25.728
You can't take it back. You
accused me of being a pervert

21:25.762 --> 21:27.596
and I work at the school.

21:27.631 --> 21:29.465
And you should never accuse any
teacher of doing something

21:29.499 --> 21:30.900
that you know they didn't do,

21:30.934 --> 21:32.902
because it makes it all the harder
to go after the few teachers

21:32.936 --> 21:35.471
who should be taken out of the
classroom and put in jail.

21:39.643 --> 21:40.843
What is wrong with me?

21:40.877 --> 21:42.511
Hey, Ben.

21:43.680 --> 21:44.880
What is wrong with you?

21:44.915 --> 21:46.482
Cake?

21:46.516 --> 21:48.517
No, thank you, Amy.

21:48.552 --> 21:51.454
It's very good cake.
Everyone's been enjoying it.

21:51.488 --> 21:52.588
At least a hundred
people have told me

21:52.622 --> 21:54.390
it's the best wedding
cake they've ever had.

21:54.424 --> 21:55.691
Did you have to get married?

21:55.725 --> 21:58.694
I mean, really, why now?

21:58.728 --> 22:00.696
Was the fourth of July
not soon enough?

22:00.730 --> 22:02.331
Are you pregnant again?

22:02.365 --> 22:04.333
What? Ben!

22:04.367 --> 22:05.768
I've lost the edit function. I
can't keep the words in my mouth.

22:05.802 --> 22:06.836
I love you!

22:08.371 --> 22:09.538
I've always loved you!

22:18.482 --> 22:19.648
Wow.

22:20.717 --> 22:22.451
He accused you of what?

22:22.486 --> 22:25.354
I can't believe this.
It's my first day of school.

22:25.388 --> 22:28.757
Yeah, well, unfortunately, we
have to report these things.

22:28.792 --> 22:31.427
Unbelievable.

22:31.461 --> 22:33.796
So what happens now? The police come
in and question me or something?

22:33.830 --> 22:35.698
Oh, no, I don't think so.

22:35.732 --> 22:39.401
It sounds more like a name calling
than an actual accusation.

22:39.436 --> 22:42.571
The principal will talk to Ben,
and then he'll talk to you,

22:42.606 --> 22:43.739
and the principal knows Adrian.

22:43.773 --> 22:45.441
Well, what does that mean?

22:45.475 --> 22:47.543
Adrian is a very nice girl.
Absolutely.

22:47.577 --> 22:49.578
What, did she date
one of her teachers?

22:49.613 --> 22:50.746
Has she ever done
anything like that?

22:50.780 --> 22:53.582
No. I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said that.

22:53.617 --> 22:55.851
There's a lot of that
going around today.

22:55.886 --> 22:59.421
I want it on record that I was falsely
accused and I haven't done anything.

22:59.456 --> 23:00.789
Okay.

23:00.824 --> 23:02.458
I am a young, black professional,
and I'm not going to have

23:02.492 --> 23:04.493
my teaching career ruined
the first day of school.

23:04.528 --> 23:05.561
I got it.

23:05.595 --> 23:07.363
Damn.

23:11.401 --> 23:12.501
Hey.

23:14.838 --> 23:16.739
What are we doing?

23:16.773 --> 23:18.707
Ben Boykewich just accused
some teacher of being a perv.

23:18.742 --> 23:22.478
Oh, and then he proclaimed
his love to Amy Juergens.

23:22.512 --> 23:23.546
He's cracking up.

23:23.580 --> 23:27.349
Yeah. And why
is he cracking up?

23:27.384 --> 23:28.817
Something is going on,
something we don't know about.

23:28.852 --> 23:31.620
I bet Raven knows.
I know she knows.

23:35.725 --> 23:37.359
He is not good for Dylan.

23:37.394 --> 23:38.794
Mmm. He's not
good for anybody.

23:38.828 --> 23:40.429
He's a nut.

23:48.438 --> 23:50.339
Why did they have to
ruin our senior year?

23:50.373 --> 23:51.807
It's like
Invasion of the Skanks.

23:51.841 --> 23:53.642
Just ignore them.

23:53.710 --> 23:55.711
Why do they have to
wear those stupid uniforms?

23:55.745 --> 23:57.546
I know.
I wish we had uniforms.

23:57.581 --> 23:58.547
Me, too.

23:58.582 --> 24:01.317
And I just feel so poor
now that they're here.

24:01.351 --> 24:02.618
I know.
And we're not poor.

24:02.652 --> 24:03.686
And I feel fat.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.621
Me, too.

24:05.655 --> 24:08.490
They just seem
so much cooler than us.

24:08.525 --> 24:12.294
Yeah, well, I know, but what
are we going to do about it?

24:13.396 --> 24:14.697
This.

24:14.731 --> 24:18.434
You are kind. You are smart.
You are important.

24:18.468 --> 24:20.502
Stop quoting <i>The Help.</i>

24:20.537 --> 24:23.472
Can't. Doesn't it make
you feel so much better?

24:23.506 --> 24:24.640
Kind of.

24:28.411 --> 24:29.545
What are you guys
doing out here?

24:29.579 --> 24:32.281
I saw Ben walk past class
and I went to the restroom.

24:32.315 --> 24:34.617
And then I heard him out here accusing
some teacher of being a perv.

24:34.651 --> 24:36.719
And I'm telling you,
this guy is no perv.

24:36.753 --> 24:38.621
I think I've
seen him somewhere.

24:38.655 --> 24:42.358
But, anyway, Ben
challenged him to a fight.

24:42.392 --> 24:43.592
A fight?

24:43.627 --> 24:46.395
Yeah, and this guy is like
this huge good-looking guy.

24:46.429 --> 24:49.498
Wait a minute, it wasn't Omar, was it?
Daniel's friend?

24:49.532 --> 24:50.666
He's student teaching here.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.434
Oh, yeah, that was him!

24:52.469 --> 24:55.304
A perv? Omar is the
nicest guy in the world.

24:55.338 --> 24:56.538
His mother is a minister.

24:56.573 --> 24:58.274
Forget Omar.

24:58.308 --> 25:00.342
Tell her the other part,
the important part.

25:01.711 --> 25:03.212
What's going on?

25:03.246 --> 25:04.680
Tell her.
Tell me what?

25:06.583 --> 25:09.218
Ben ran into Amy
out here in the hallway

25:09.252 --> 25:11.420
with her big cake you got her,

25:11.454 --> 25:14.456
and he told her he loved her.

25:16.559 --> 25:19.395
And he always has and he's really
upset that she got married.

25:19.429 --> 25:21.230
What?

25:21.264 --> 25:24.202
You're dumping him. He's cracking
up and he's dangerous now.

25:25.402 --> 25:27.569
Dangerous how?

25:27.604 --> 25:29.605
You two better
tell us what's going on.

25:39.976 --> 25:41.426
Play 23!

25:41.546 --> 25:43.199
Ten-hut!

25:47.050 --> 25:48.851
Pappas is pretty good.

25:48.886 --> 25:50.887
I'm just not sure he has
any leadership qualities.

25:55.893 --> 25:58.828
I wouldn't write him off.
He's got solid skills.

25:58.862 --> 26:00.897
We got a lot of guys
with solid skills.

26:00.931 --> 26:03.699
He did a good job for us.
He's a Christian, you know.

26:09.940 --> 26:12.975
Hot damn!
Pappas is our Tebow!

26:13.010 --> 26:15.778
Oh, no, he's not
a good Christian.

26:15.812 --> 26:19.015
His dad's a minister but I don't think
Jack even goes to church anymore.

26:19.049 --> 26:21.851
Get him back in church.
I don't care how you do it.

26:33.997 --> 26:35.898
Oh, hi. Hi.

26:35.933 --> 26:37.934
Uh, could you help me?

26:37.968 --> 26:40.836
I need that book
on the top shelf

26:40.871 --> 26:42.104
and I can't reach it.

26:42.139 --> 26:43.839
Sure. I'll get it for you.

26:46.843 --> 26:48.010
Hey, Adrian.

26:48.045 --> 26:50.079
Ricky! Hi.

26:50.113 --> 26:51.981
Here. See you around.

26:52.015 --> 26:54.083
Hope so.

26:54.117 --> 26:56.118
Oh, he's married.
Pay no attention to him.

26:58.956 --> 27:01.924
So I guess you heard.

27:01.959 --> 27:03.926
Yeah.
Good for you and Amy.

27:03.961 --> 27:05.795
I hope you'll be very happy.

27:05.829 --> 27:07.697
I know I wasn't happy
when I was married,

27:07.731 --> 27:09.865
but hey,
I'm not married anymore.

27:09.900 --> 27:13.069
I mean, Ben is a nice guy,
he's a really nice guy.

27:13.103 --> 27:15.705
It just...
You know, it gets old,

27:15.739 --> 27:19.675
being with the same
person all the time.

27:19.710 --> 27:20.876
What happened
to your boyfriend?

27:20.911 --> 27:23.846
Oh, he got all upset
because I kissed Grace.

27:23.880 --> 27:27.083
But he'll come around,
they all do.

27:27.117 --> 27:30.052
I'm happy being with
Amy, really happy.

27:30.087 --> 27:32.154
So, let me see your schedule.
Do we have any class together?

27:32.189 --> 27:34.757
Mmm, I doubt it.
I'm in the business school.

27:34.791 --> 27:36.692
Still, let me see.

27:37.761 --> 27:39.662
Huh. Freshman English.

27:39.696 --> 27:40.796
You're kidding.

27:40.831 --> 27:42.765
Oh, loosen up, will you?

27:42.799 --> 27:45.067
We're going to be bumping
into each other now and then,

27:45.102 --> 27:47.737
and I'm not uncomfortable
if you're not uncomfortable,

27:47.771 --> 27:50.039
and you shouldn't
be uncomfortable.

27:50.073 --> 27:53.743
Unless of course you're
still thinking about me.

27:53.777 --> 27:55.711
No, I'm not.
Good.

27:55.746 --> 27:58.647
Because I'm not going to be fooling
around here like I did in high school.

27:58.682 --> 27:59.915
I've got a goal.

27:59.950 --> 28:01.751
I'm going to graduate with
honors and get into law school.

28:01.785 --> 28:03.719
Sounds good.
And what are your plans?

28:03.754 --> 28:07.023
Other than being married
to Amy and raising John?

28:07.057 --> 28:08.691
Any goals?
Not really.

28:08.725 --> 28:09.992
Just want to do the best I can.

28:10.027 --> 28:11.127
So that you can
end up doing what?

28:11.161 --> 28:12.728
I don't know.

28:12.763 --> 28:15.031
Okay, well,
just in case your goal

28:15.065 --> 28:18.000
is to rise to the top
of Boykewich International,

28:18.035 --> 28:20.903
which I think
you'd be great at,

28:20.937 --> 28:25.074
Ben Boykewich is never
going to let that happen.

28:25.108 --> 28:27.710
He hates the butcher business,

28:27.744 --> 28:28.744
but he hates you more.

28:29.913 --> 28:32.915
See you.
Wait. Wait.

28:32.949 --> 28:35.751
Ben doesn't hate me, he's my friend.
Why would he hate me?

28:35.786 --> 28:38.954
Are you kidding? You just
married the woman he loves.

28:46.966 --> 28:49.303
Home sick? Jacob got home sick?

28:49.423 --> 28:50.202
Baby.

28:50.683 --> 28:53.518
I think he panicked when it came to
registering for school this morning,

28:53.553 --> 28:55.821
and he wanted to go home and
see his mom and his friends.

28:55.855 --> 28:57.522
So that's that.

28:57.557 --> 29:00.559
I have a feeling he'll be back.

29:00.593 --> 29:02.828
You would know,
half-sister, half-brother.

29:02.862 --> 29:05.464
Will you drop that please?
I'm not half anything.

29:05.498 --> 29:08.867
Half-Christian,
half-not-a-Christian.

29:10.503 --> 29:11.937
That's not funny.
Okay.

29:11.971 --> 29:13.605
Do you mind if
I say the blessing

29:13.639 --> 29:15.574
before we all just
dig in like animals?

29:15.608 --> 29:16.708
Who's an animal?

29:16.742 --> 29:17.876
I'm fine with that.
Say the blessing.

29:17.910 --> 29:19.711
Oh, come on.
Do we have to?

29:19.745 --> 29:21.713
Tom.
Shall we join hands?

29:21.747 --> 29:22.848
Sure.

29:24.784 --> 29:27.519
Dear Lord, bless this house
and all that are in it

29:27.553 --> 29:28.887
and please watch over
our half-brother, Jacob,

29:28.921 --> 29:30.589
as he travels back to his home.

29:30.623 --> 29:31.890
Amen.

29:31.924 --> 29:34.593
Bless the food to the
nourishment of our bodies

29:34.627 --> 29:37.662
and let it give us the strength to
abstain from sex outside of marriage.

29:37.697 --> 29:39.731
No amen on that one.

29:39.765 --> 29:41.666
Guide us in our daily choices,

29:41.701 --> 29:43.702
helping us to choose what
is right over what is wrong

29:43.736 --> 29:45.704
and giving us the good sense
to know the difference.

29:45.738 --> 29:46.838
Are you finished?

29:51.644 --> 29:55.614
Please help those children whose
parents are still children themselves

29:55.648 --> 29:57.749
and watch over all the families,
all over the world...

29:57.783 --> 29:59.551
Would you guys please stop it?

30:00.686 --> 30:01.887
That's completely sacrilegious.

30:03.589 --> 30:04.656
You asked to say a blessing.

30:04.690 --> 30:05.891
You didn't say anything
about a lecture.

30:05.925 --> 30:09.561
Especially by a
half-sister, half-brother.

30:09.595 --> 30:10.896
And I thought
my family was nuts.

30:10.930 --> 30:12.964
My other family. My former family.

30:12.999 --> 30:14.866
Well, it's my family
now, but...

30:14.901 --> 30:16.968
Jack's coach is calling me.
I wonder what he wants.

30:17.003 --> 30:18.970
No phone calls during dinner.
Yeah.

30:20.006 --> 30:21.039
Coach?

30:23.943 --> 30:26.778
I guess I'm gonna have to work
my way up to being a stepfather.

30:26.812 --> 30:31.550
Go with half-father.
Half-father, half-mother.

30:31.584 --> 30:32.951
That's one too many, Tom.
You gotta know when to stop.

30:32.985 --> 30:34.619
I'm a grown man.

30:34.654 --> 30:35.687
Okay.

30:46.566 --> 30:49.568
What is this?
Beans and weenies.

30:49.602 --> 30:52.637
Or is it weenies and beans?
Mmm. Beans and weenies.

30:52.672 --> 30:54.906
No offense, but it's revolting.

30:55.908 --> 30:58.610
Mmm. I like it.

30:59.745 --> 31:01.613
My mom makes this.

31:01.647 --> 31:03.515
When I was a kid,

31:03.549 --> 31:06.851
we used to pretend that we were
cowboys eating around a campfire

31:06.886 --> 31:09.754
and we'd eat it right out
of the pan on the stove.

31:09.789 --> 31:12.958
And the person who picked up the
square white thing in their spoon

31:12.992 --> 31:14.693
got to wear the cowboy hat.

31:14.727 --> 31:16.761
That's a hunk
of animal fat, you idiot.

31:16.796 --> 31:19.764
Really? 'Cause I just ate it.
And it was delicious.

31:19.799 --> 31:21.566
That's why it was the prize.

31:21.601 --> 31:22.901
This is why I am going to
cooking school in Italy.

31:25.671 --> 31:28.740
I was going to talk
to you later about it,

31:28.774 --> 31:30.642
but you might be sick later.

31:30.676 --> 31:32.644
I got into that cooking school.
We leave Sunday.

31:32.678 --> 31:34.512
What?
We leave Sunday.

31:34.547 --> 31:38.783
I can't go to Italy on Sunday.
I have to mow the lawn.

31:38.818 --> 31:40.819
And I don't have any money.

31:41.921 --> 31:44.489
And you can't go either.
Excuse me.

31:44.523 --> 31:45.624
Seconds.

31:49.795 --> 31:51.663
I hate it here.

31:51.697 --> 31:53.765
So why should we stay here
if we could be in Italy?

31:53.799 --> 31:57.435
Oh, I don't know. Because this is
your family and they love you?

31:57.470 --> 31:59.638
Oh, yeah, this is
my family who loves me,

31:59.672 --> 32:03.541
you and Nora, the three of us eating
beans and a hunk of animal fat.

32:04.777 --> 32:06.511
We have to get out of
here before our lives

32:06.545 --> 32:08.480
are completely
ruined like Ricky's.

32:09.649 --> 32:10.782
You knew I couldn't stay here.

32:10.816 --> 32:12.751
Is that why you slept with me?

32:12.785 --> 32:15.754
So I'd go on another one
of your big adventures?

32:15.788 --> 32:18.757
I told you, Ashley, I can't
follow you all over the world.

32:18.791 --> 32:20.492
I didn't even know
about the school thing

32:20.526 --> 32:21.693
when I slept with you
the first time.

32:21.727 --> 32:22.927
I don't want to go.

32:22.962 --> 32:24.729
I want to stay here.
I like it here.

32:24.764 --> 32:26.631
Well, I don't.

32:26.666 --> 32:29.668
Ashley, I love you.

32:30.670 --> 32:31.970
And you love me.

32:32.838 --> 32:34.706
Stop running away.

32:34.740 --> 32:37.609
Um, hi, just going to
ask this one question.

32:37.643 --> 32:41.446
Ashley, does your dad know you decided
to go to this cooking school?

32:41.480 --> 32:43.581
He doesn't have any say in it.

32:52.591 --> 32:54.726
Great.

32:54.760 --> 32:56.861
Now I've got to go home
and convince my parents

32:56.896 --> 32:58.763
to pay for me to go
halfway around the world

32:58.798 --> 33:01.800
so I can be with the girl they
don't think I'm having sex with.

33:05.504 --> 33:08.640
Unbelievable! There's a
second white square!

33:08.674 --> 33:10.508
It's my lucky day.

33:10.710 --> 33:11.843
Kind of.

33:28.861 --> 33:32.697
Did I tell you that Ashley is
going to Italy to cooking school?

33:32.732 --> 33:33.798
Is that the one with the baby?

33:33.833 --> 33:36.735
No, that's Amy.

33:36.769 --> 33:39.671
Amy and Ricky got married.
They eloped.

33:43.809 --> 33:46.444
My daughter
eloped too, you know.

33:48.714 --> 33:50.915
I made her feel
so bad about that.

33:53.619 --> 33:54.853
I wish I hadn't done that.

33:56.689 --> 33:59.457
My daughter was
such a lovely girl.

34:01.627 --> 34:03.828
So lovely and smart.

34:06.932 --> 34:08.600
Do you know my daughter?

34:09.802 --> 34:11.770
I'm getting to know her.

34:18.577 --> 34:19.744
Your salads will
be coming up shortly.

34:19.779 --> 34:22.514
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.

34:23.916 --> 34:26.684
So, what's the plan, Ben?

34:26.719 --> 34:27.918
What do you want to do?
The clock is ticking.

34:27.953 --> 34:29.788
There's nothing I can do.
They're married.

34:29.822 --> 34:32.857
Ben, not about Amy and Ricky.
Forget that.

34:32.891 --> 34:34.592
About the other situation.

34:34.627 --> 34:35.793
What do you think I should do?

34:35.828 --> 34:37.661
Why would you listen to me now?

34:37.696 --> 34:39.697
You never listened
to me before.

34:39.732 --> 34:42.567
I told you,
you are on your own.

34:42.601 --> 34:45.703
Is that just in regard to

34:45.737 --> 34:47.539
the trouble with Dylan

34:47.572 --> 34:49.607
or does that
include all trouble?

34:49.641 --> 34:50.842
All trouble?

34:52.511 --> 34:53.678
You're in more
trouble than that?

34:53.712 --> 34:56.815
I, uh, called one of the
teachers a pervert.

34:56.849 --> 34:58.450
Because?

34:58.484 --> 35:00.518
It's Adrian's boyfriend, Omar.

35:00.553 --> 35:02.587
Omar is student teaching.

35:02.621 --> 35:05.490
I didn't know.
It took me by surprise.

35:05.524 --> 35:06.624
I misspoke.

35:06.659 --> 35:08.660
You called him a pervert
for absolutely no reason?

35:08.694 --> 35:10.628
Yeah, and, uh,

35:11.497 --> 35:12.697
he reported me.

35:12.731 --> 35:14.866
And now there's going to be
some sort of investigation.

35:14.900 --> 35:17.702
What happened to you, Ben?

35:17.736 --> 35:21.606
You used to be such a good kid.

35:22.608 --> 35:23.775
And now...

35:24.677 --> 35:27.612
Now you're a good man, Ben,

35:27.646 --> 35:31.416
but you just keep
doing stupid, stupid things.

35:31.450 --> 35:32.684
I know.

35:32.718 --> 35:34.552
I'm angry.

35:34.587 --> 35:38.356
I'm really angry
and just out of control.

35:38.390 --> 35:41.759
Angry about what? About what
happened with you and Adrian,

35:41.794 --> 35:43.761
losing the baby?

35:43.796 --> 35:45.430
Are you still upset about that?

35:45.464 --> 35:48.466
That's always
going to hurt, but no.

35:48.501 --> 35:51.703
I'm angry that
Ricky stole my life.

35:51.737 --> 35:54.472
Amy should have been mine. Then
none of this would have happened.

35:58.611 --> 35:59.777
Hello!

36:01.547 --> 36:03.414
I'm here and I'm...

36:03.816 --> 36:05.683
Hi.

36:07.520 --> 36:08.553
What is going on?

36:08.587 --> 36:10.421
Your friend Omar dropped by.

36:10.456 --> 36:11.756
Just wanted to introduce
myself to your parents.

36:11.790 --> 36:14.592
You know, in case we ever decide
to go out again or anything.

36:14.627 --> 36:16.494
Oh, really?

36:16.529 --> 36:19.397
Sure you just didn't have a bad first
day at school and need legal help?

36:19.431 --> 36:20.498
We heard all about it.

36:20.533 --> 36:21.933
Did you hear all about it?
Ben called me.

36:21.967 --> 36:24.536
We're not going to talk about Ben
when we have company over, are we?

36:24.570 --> 36:26.437
No, of course not.

36:26.472 --> 36:28.606
Come on.
Sit down. Let's eat.

36:28.641 --> 36:30.675
Really, Omar, what
are you doing here?

36:30.709 --> 36:32.744
I don't just drop by your parents'
house and have dinner with them.

36:32.778 --> 36:34.712
You can if you want,

36:34.747 --> 36:37.782
but I got the impression that you're not
interested in getting to know my parents.

36:37.816 --> 36:40.618
I, on the other hand, am interested
in getting to know yours.

36:43.455 --> 36:45.690
I told you, I'm focusing
on school this year.

36:45.724 --> 36:48.726
Well, if anyone
would understand that,

36:48.761 --> 36:51.529
that would be me
since I'm a teacher.

36:51.564 --> 36:54.465
And by the way, my mom's
a Protestant minister

36:54.500 --> 36:58.369
and my dad's in law enforcement.
He's a detective.

36:58.404 --> 36:59.504
He traced down your dad for me.

37:00.539 --> 37:01.606
I really like you.

37:01.640 --> 37:02.640
Stop trying to impress them.

37:02.675 --> 37:04.442
It's too late.

37:10.516 --> 37:11.616
This is good.

37:11.650 --> 37:13.585
Yeah.

37:13.619 --> 37:15.753
I've eaten so much
of it, I feel sick.

37:15.788 --> 37:17.855
I feel sick, too,

37:17.923 --> 37:19.691
but not from the cake.

37:19.725 --> 37:22.527
My mother sent insurance
forms for us to fill out

37:22.561 --> 37:26.431
so the company can put you
and John on the insurance.

37:26.465 --> 37:27.699
Hmm. That's nice.

37:29.768 --> 37:32.837
Yeah, I know.

37:34.773 --> 37:37.709
And then Leo gave us
an envelope full of cash

37:37.743 --> 37:39.510
and invited me to be
a part of the business.

37:39.545 --> 37:41.579
Wait, that's so great. That's
what you've always wanted.

37:43.449 --> 37:45.416
Oh. Right.

37:47.686 --> 37:50.388
And my mom gave us these.

37:52.591 --> 37:54.359
They belonged to her parents.

37:54.393 --> 37:55.627
Are you going to
wear a wedding band?

37:56.629 --> 37:57.662
Are you?

37:58.497 --> 37:59.697
I guess so.

38:13.646 --> 38:16.681
I've been assigned
a freshman girl to mentor.

38:16.715 --> 38:18.683
She's six months pregnant.

38:18.717 --> 38:21.853
And I'm supposed to help her
make the right decisions. Boy.

38:21.887 --> 38:23.554
Are you going to
change your name?

38:23.589 --> 38:24.789
I don't know how that works.

38:24.823 --> 38:27.659
I mean, everyone is already
calling me Mrs. Underwood.

38:27.693 --> 38:31.629
Oh. There was a surprise wedding
shower for me at the nursery.

38:31.664 --> 38:35.533
There are gifts in the car
that I didn't bring in.

38:35.567 --> 38:37.568
I just feel so guilty.

38:37.603 --> 38:40.672
Some of these ladies just work
part-time and they bought us gifts.

38:40.706 --> 38:43.441
But I suppose
we're keeping the gifts.

38:43.809 --> 38:45.376
I suppose we are.

38:45.411 --> 38:47.679
I don't know, Amy.
Did we do the right thing?

38:47.713 --> 38:49.231
It's too late now.

38:53.519 --> 38:54.619
Got the wedding video
in the mail.

38:56.319 --> 38:59.188
You want to see it?
Yeah. Sure.

39:21.618 --> 39:23.819
<i>Do not move</i>
<i>off the marks.</i>

39:28.759 --> 39:31.861
<i>Stay right where you are.</i>
<i>Do not move off that mark.</i>

39:31.895 --> 39:33.696
<i>You're completely surrounded.</i>

39:33.730 --> 39:37.833
<i>It's going to be</i>
<i>a beautiful video.</i>

39:37.868 --> 39:42.872
Here we go. Ashes to
ashes, dust to dust.

39:42.906 --> 39:46.642
Oh! It's the wrong book!

39:46.676 --> 39:48.611
Hold on while I get
the right one.

39:48.645 --> 39:51.547
Where did you find this guy?
The Internet.

39:51.581 --> 39:56.452
Got it! Got it! Y'all cheer up!
Vows are coming.

39:56.486 --> 39:57.620
Did you write your vows?

39:57.654 --> 39:59.488
No. We didn't write anything.

39:59.523 --> 40:02.558
Did you get your flowers?
$49.99.

40:02.592 --> 40:03.759
It will last you a lifetime.

40:03.794 --> 40:05.728
It's okay. No, you
should have flowers.

40:05.762 --> 40:06.896
We'll take the flowers.

40:10.567 --> 40:11.600
Silk.

40:11.935 --> 40:13.502
Oh.

40:13.537 --> 40:15.738
$49.99.
Pay as you go.

40:16.606 --> 40:18.541
Here.

40:18.575 --> 40:22.778
Whoo-hoo! Yee-haw! Steak night!
Oh, I forgot something.

40:26.783 --> 40:28.584
Rose petal scent.

40:30.620 --> 40:31.720
Can we get on with this?

40:31.755 --> 40:34.757
Oh, you've got your
whole life together.

40:35.792 --> 40:38.627
What's the rush?
Slow down.

40:38.662 --> 40:41.597
Okay. Got it, Dicky?

40:41.631 --> 40:44.433
That's Ricky.
Ricky and Amy.

40:44.467 --> 40:45.701
Got it, Dick.

40:47.604 --> 40:48.737
Let's do a little dance.

40:48.772 --> 40:50.372
What?

40:50.407 --> 40:51.473
A little song, a little dance,

40:51.508 --> 40:53.576
a little seltzer in your pants.

40:53.610 --> 40:56.512
Chuckles the Clown.
Mary Tyler Moore?

40:57.714 --> 40:59.481
Oh, forget it.

40:59.516 --> 41:02.651
We got to get the... We
got to get the mood up.

41:02.686 --> 41:07.423
Get the blood flowing. You're going
to need that on your honeymoon.

41:08.692 --> 41:12.561
I'm gonna play y'all a record
that inspired all of this.

41:14.798 --> 41:16.699
Amy.
I know.

41:16.733 --> 41:18.500
This is not what
I was expecting.

41:18.535 --> 41:20.469
This wasn't on the Internet? No.

41:23.740 --> 41:26.475
<i>♪ The day the squirrel</i>
<i>went berserk</i>

41:26.509 --> 41:28.577
<i>♪ In the First</i>
<i>Self-Righteous Church</i>

41:28.612 --> 41:31.780
See them squirrels, that's
what I'm talking about!

41:31.815 --> 41:33.582
Come on, get with it!

41:40.757 --> 41:42.524
Hallelujah!

41:42.559 --> 41:44.560
I am not dancing.

41:45.729 --> 41:47.663
I feel stupid.

41:47.697 --> 41:50.366
Because this is stupid.
You really want to do this?

41:50.400 --> 41:52.501
Let this idiot marry us?

41:52.535 --> 41:53.569
Uh...

41:58.341 --> 42:00.609
Well, we'll certainly remember
it for the rest of our lives.

42:00.644 --> 42:03.312
You want to remember this? You
want this to be our wedding?

42:03.346 --> 42:04.713
Not really.
Me neither.

42:04.748 --> 42:06.682
We don't have to do this,
we can go somewhere else,

42:06.716 --> 42:08.517
this weekend or
another weekend.

42:08.551 --> 42:10.419
I know, but I don't know
how to get out of this,

42:10.453 --> 42:11.620
and we already paid him.

42:11.655 --> 42:12.788
Let's just make
a run for it. You go,

42:12.822 --> 42:14.523
I'll stop him
if he comes after you.

42:14.557 --> 42:16.458
No, I'm too scared.
He's crazy.

42:16.493 --> 42:19.328
Go! Go!
Are you sure?

42:19.362 --> 42:21.597
Look at him! He probably doesn't
even have a license to marry us.

42:21.631 --> 42:23.499
Run, Amy, run!

42:27.504 --> 42:29.505
Thanks! We changed our mind!
Oh, wait.

42:29.539 --> 42:31.507
But wait, we're getting
to the good part.

42:31.541 --> 42:32.508
Oh.

42:44.621 --> 42:45.896
Ricky, my door is locked.

42:46.016 --> 42:47.244
Sorry, sorry.

42:47.364 --> 42:48.718
I don't know what I'm doing.

42:50.212 --> 42:51.775
I can't believe I didn't open
the door for you.

42:51.895 --> 42:53.149
It's okay, it's okay.

43:00.957 --> 43:03.157
- I love you.
- I love you too.
