WEBVTT

00:04.571 --> 00:06.338
(crying, speaking hebrew)

00:06.340 --> 00:08.340
Jackie...

00:08.342 --> 00:11.076
Wouldn't have wanted war
breaking out over this either.

00:12.712 --> 00:14.346
What do you need?

00:14.348 --> 00:16.081
Revenge.

00:16.083 --> 00:18.717
I would like your permission to
travel to europe to find bodnar.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.053
What are you waiting for?
Take dinozzo.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.155
Bodnar's on ziva's laptop.
Trace it like the wind.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.724
I know you blame me
for your father's death, ziva.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.626
Is there anyone else
to blame?

00:30.063 --> 00:32.197
Told you I would find you, ilan.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.532
(screaming)

00:33.534 --> 00:34.433
(crashing)

00:36.803 --> 00:38.203
Is it over?

00:38.205 --> 00:40.272
It's over.

00:42.108 --> 00:44.810
Woman:
Oh, I hate it when they cry.
What'd you say to him?

00:44.812 --> 00:47.079
Woman 2:
I said it wasn't him; it was me.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.781
That's original.
It's true.

00:48.783 --> 00:50.382
Me... Didn't like him.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.784
What was I supposed to say?

00:51.786 --> 00:54.720
I prefer something a bit
more subtle like...

00:54.722 --> 00:57.423
"oh, I hate the way you chew."

00:57.425 --> 01:00.259
I did hate the way he chewed.
Mm!

01:00.261 --> 01:03.228
And if they don't
take the hint...
Man: Get the hell away from me!

01:03.230 --> 01:04.797
Sounds about right.

01:04.799 --> 01:06.732
I saw you!
Get away from me!

01:08.068 --> 01:09.368
Stop!
Aah!

01:09.370 --> 01:10.302
(grunting)

01:10.304 --> 01:11.403
(yelling, grunting)

01:11.405 --> 01:13.305
Hey!
Man: Get off of me!

01:13.307 --> 01:15.074
Who the hell are you?
Who are you?
Calm down!

01:15.076 --> 01:17.409
I saw him! I saw him!

01:17.411 --> 01:19.344
What do you want?!
I don't know what
you're talking about!

01:19.346 --> 01:21.380
Camera operator (over radio):
What do you want me to do?

01:21.382 --> 01:24.583
Nothing.

02:08.661 --> 02:09.728
Tony:
Well, hey, there.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.663
Speedy gonzales, huh?

02:11.665 --> 02:14.266
You almost killed marlon
from accounting.
I'm sorry, tony.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.869
I'm still getting used
to how this thing drives.
And the world is...

02:16.871 --> 02:18.871
Still getting used
to how you drive.

02:18.873 --> 02:20.706
Where's the mini?

02:20.708 --> 02:22.174
Thought it was time
to make a change.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.510
You know, put the past behind.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.711
Oh, well,
that's gonna be...

02:25.713 --> 02:27.646
Harder than just buying
a new car, you know.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.615
Yes, I noticed.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.617
So what's the plan
with the mini?

02:31.619 --> 02:32.618
I sold it.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.619
What?!

02:33.621 --> 02:34.887
I told you if you ever

02:34.889 --> 02:36.855
Wanted to get rid of it,
that-that I would take it.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.457
Well, I didn't think
you were serious.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.292
What part of
"I'm totally serious"

02:40.294 --> 02:43.295
Made you think that?
I'm sorry, tony.
I know you wanted the car,

02:43.297 --> 02:45.397
But I just didn't think it was
a good idea to sell it to you.

02:45.399 --> 02:46.532
Why not?

02:46.534 --> 02:50.702
Me, too.
And I didn't want
anything to happen to it.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.371
What are you saying?

02:52.373 --> 02:54.206
Mcgee:
She's saying you're

02:54.208 --> 02:55.507
A car killer.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.409
What?!
A car killer.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.877
Gibbs: Everybody
needs a hobby.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.480
Your new ride, ziva?
Uh-huh.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.215
Nice.
Thanks.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.683
Oh, by the way,
my friend terry,

03:04.685 --> 03:05.751
Loving your mini.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.886
Oh.
Gibbs: Hey...

03:07.888 --> 03:09.288
Get in the car.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.858
Gibbs: No, you and ziva
go up to the office.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.226
We got it covered.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.228
(door shuts, car drives away)

03:16.230 --> 03:18.297
Hmm.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.969
Mcgee: Base security responded
to the assault.

03:23.971 --> 03:27.439
I.D.'d the attacker as petty
officer third class evan lowry.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.441
They said he was raving like
a madman when they arrived.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.877
Demanded to speak
with ncis.
About?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.745
He said national security.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.219
Lowry:
<i>That guy was following me.</i>

03:40.221 --> 03:41.520
That's why I was chasing him.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.888
No, you did more than chase him.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.424
And how do you know
he was following you?

03:45.426 --> 03:47.926
Because everywhere I go,
there he is.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.529
When I finally confronted
the guy, he ran.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.997
Got away when those
two leatherneck chicks

03:51.999 --> 03:53.265
Pulled me off him.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.466
But it's not just him.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.468
Someone's been going
through my e-mail, too.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.805
And how do you know that?
Because

03:59.807 --> 04:02.708
They're marking messages as read
that I didn't read.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.576
I think they've even been
in my house,

04:04.578 --> 04:05.611
They've been in my car...

04:05.613 --> 04:06.878
I can smell the cologne.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.880
They've even been in my trunk.

04:08.882 --> 04:12.884
I tried the cops.
They thought I was crazy.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.287
You said this was
about national security.
That's right.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.822
I work on a navy destroyer.

04:16.824 --> 04:17.956
Mcgee:
Yes. As a...

04:17.958 --> 04:19.291
Cook.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.326
Culinary specialist.

04:21.328 --> 04:22.794
Do you have any idea
what would happen

04:22.796 --> 04:24.796
If a case of e coli
broke out in my galley?

04:24.798 --> 04:26.832
It could disable
the entire ship.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.400
What if they're trying
to infect me with something,

04:28.402 --> 04:29.601
So that I infect the crew?

04:29.603 --> 04:32.271
"they"?
The people following me.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.506
I think that maybe
they're north korean.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.010
Right.

04:38.012 --> 04:40.012
Are you on any medications?

04:40.014 --> 04:41.847
No, I'm not
on medications.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.448
And would you stop scribbling
in that notepad?

04:43.450 --> 04:44.950
Hey!

04:44.952 --> 04:46.551
I'm sorry.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.320
I'm sorry.

04:48.322 --> 04:51.790
These people are
driving me crazy.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.592
But I am not crazy.
You have to believe me.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.926
It all started

04:54.928 --> 04:57.329
Two weeks ago,
after I got mugged.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.064
I see the same people
everywhere I go.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.299
I'm telling you,
they're following me.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.333
Boss?

05:01.335 --> 05:03.068
They always...

05:04.003 --> 05:05.437
What the hell is that?

05:05.439 --> 05:07.339
It's a gps tracking device.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.043
He's not crazy.
Someone is following him.

05:23.890 --> 05:25.390
Let's go.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.392
Tony:
Petty officer evan lowry,

05:27.394 --> 05:29.861
24, just returned
from a six-month deployment

05:29.863 --> 05:31.363
On the u.S.S. <i>Fitzgerald.</i>

05:31.365 --> 05:34.032
Where he worked as a cook.
Culinary specialist.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.802
Tdy?
Mess duty at quantico,
pending his next assignment.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.503
He has no access
to any sensitive material.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.504
Ziva:
And no unusual

05:39.506 --> 05:42.107
Nothing worth mentioning,
unless you consider

05:42.109 --> 05:44.643
A sailor drinking like a sailor
worth mentioning.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.345
So why's he being followed?

05:49.716 --> 05:51.717
Okay, then <i>who</i> is
following him?

05:51.719 --> 05:54.786
Lowry is in the conference room
working with a sketch artist.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.055
Abby's taking
the gps tracker apart.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.790
Hopefully she can pull prints.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.460
Then there's the mugging.
Lowry said that, uh,

06:01.462 --> 06:03.528
It all started
after he was attacked.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.963
Maybe the mugger
is the one following him.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.032
Tony: Eyewitnesses only gave
a rough description.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.368
Ziva: And lowry barely
remembers the assault.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.702
Police report says
that he got a concussion

06:10.704 --> 06:12.404
From a tire iron to the head.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.740
Mcgee: Also says his backpack
and cell phone were stolen.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.375
That'd mean the mugger
would know where he lived.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.377
Think it's connected?
I think it's our best lead.

06:18.379 --> 06:19.878
Ziva, check out that sketch.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.481
Mcgee, stolen cell phone,
see if you can trace it.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.483
Well, thieves usually wipe
stolen cell phones

06:24.485 --> 06:26.752
To make it harder to trace.
(tony gibbering)

06:26.754 --> 06:27.886
Can you trace it?

06:27.888 --> 06:28.720
I can try.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.855
Thank you.

06:31.524 --> 06:33.725
If he's taken a photo
and e-mailed it to anybody,

06:33.727 --> 06:36.061
I can use the gps coordinates
from the exif data...

06:36.063 --> 06:38.797
You do realize if you keep
telling us how you do your job

06:38.799 --> 06:41.066
Then we're not gonna
need you anymore?

06:41.734 --> 06:43.602
Oh, got a hit.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.737
Northwest dc.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.805
Go!

06:49.041 --> 06:50.709
Vance: No, this is totally
unacceptable.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.611
How long do we have
to wait for the inquiry

06:52.613 --> 06:54.413
Into ilan bodnar's death?

06:54.415 --> 06:55.747
Because we'd like

06:55.749 --> 06:58.450
Sir...
To get started
with the debriefing.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.452
So get someone
from dod-ig down here

07:00.454 --> 07:02.921
So we can close
the book on this damn thing.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.623
When?

07:04.625 --> 07:06.491
So where the hell is he?
(man clears throat)

07:07.059 --> 07:08.627
Never mind. I found him.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.863
I hope it's okay
that your assistant

07:11.865 --> 07:13.532
Told me to wait
in your office.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.067
Richard parsons,
independent counsel

07:16.069 --> 07:17.602
Retained
by the inspector general.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.504
I'm here for the...
I know why you're here.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.639
So get started.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.442
Actually, I just
got back on the red-eye.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.444
I was gonna... Go home,

07:25.446 --> 07:28.113
Shower, have some breakfast--
have you eaten yet?

07:28.115 --> 07:30.215
I'll send for a sandwich.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.884
A lot of
paperwork to do.
Well, great.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.620
Most people don't like it,
but without paperwork

07:35.622 --> 07:38.123
The world would be...
So, you'll get started then?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.158
Immediately, if you want.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.494
Just inform the team
that I'm here.

07:42.496 --> 07:46.698
Yes, director?
Yes, um, find agents dinozzo
and mcgee please.

07:46.700 --> 07:50.469
Yes, thank you.
You can start with them.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.070
Relax, director.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.606
I'm just here to cross
some t's and dot some I's.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.641
I'll be as quick
and painless as possible.

08:01.581 --> 08:03.648
(sighs)

08:11.992 --> 08:15.994
Never been on an actual
dc stakeout before.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.529
This is fun.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.264
They don't let me out
of the office very much.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.632
Really?

08:20.634 --> 08:21.933
Could've fooled me.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.535
Thanks for letting me tag along.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.537
Well, we didn't.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.606
Director vance
insisted you join us.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.676
So, what does that do?

08:31.678 --> 08:33.178
We traced a stolen cell phone

08:33.180 --> 08:36.581
Now we just need someone
to use it to pinpoint

08:36.583 --> 08:37.716
Its exact location.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.117
And then you bust 'em.

08:39.119 --> 08:42.120
Can we just get
this over with?

08:42.122 --> 08:43.121
Yeah.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.789
Thanks.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.525
(grunts)

08:46.527 --> 08:48.693
Let me just get
my briefcase open.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.730
Double-oh-seven.

08:53.799 --> 08:55.233
All right, so,

08:55.235 --> 08:58.570
Let's set the wayback time
machine to the beginning,

08:58.572 --> 09:00.572
Shall we?
So that's, what, January?

09:00.574 --> 09:02.073
(inhales, sighs)

09:02.075 --> 09:04.676
When did you first
become aware that, uh,

09:04.678 --> 09:06.845
Eli david was in town?

09:06.847 --> 09:08.980
Gibbs told us
that Friday morning.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.049
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Someone's coming.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.284
Someone's coming.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.887
Nope. Wrong sex.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.624
Tony:
Ah, right sex.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.927
Wrong time.
Well, speaking of time,

09:21.929 --> 09:23.595
What time did agent david say

09:23.597 --> 09:26.598
That she was going to meet
her father for shabbat dinner?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.733
Not sure exactly.

09:31.137 --> 09:34.139
Well, how do you know
if you're not sure exactly?

09:35.107 --> 09:36.708
'cause I've seen <i>yentl.</i>

09:36.710 --> 09:38.076
(chuckles)

09:38.078 --> 09:39.578
Well played.
(sniffs)

09:39.580 --> 09:41.913
Well, this matches up
with everything I got,

09:41.915 --> 09:43.715
So t's are being crossed.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.884
I just got one more
question for you guys.

09:45.886 --> 09:49.788
How does one go to the bathroom
on a stakeout?

09:56.162 --> 09:57.796
(chuckles)

09:57.798 --> 09:59.164
I could get into this.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.132
(quiet beeping)

10:01.134 --> 10:03.068
Oh, hold off. I got something.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.235
Someone's making a call.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.270
Where?

10:05.272 --> 10:06.671
Northeast corner.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.376
Tony:
Oh, there we go.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.044
All right. Listen,

10:13.046 --> 10:15.313
Be a dear and finish
that before we get back.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.782
Yeah.
Thanks.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.932
He had your cell phone on him.
Your backpack

10:33.934 --> 10:35.400
Was in his car.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.768
He look familiar?

10:36.770 --> 10:38.336
I think that's the
guy who mugged me.

10:38.338 --> 10:42.807
I don't really remember
the attack, to be honest.
Question is,

10:42.809 --> 10:45.410
Does he know anything about
who's been following you?

10:45.412 --> 10:47.846
(door opens)

10:49.115 --> 10:52.817
Hey, I found that cell phone
in the trash, man.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.220
Somebody must've thrown it away.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.354
Really?

10:56.356 --> 10:57.956
Yeah.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.691
Okay.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.026
Thanks for coming.

11:03.796 --> 11:05.764
Sit down.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.300
You're doing two to
15 for armed robbery,

11:09.302 --> 11:11.736
So, make some peace with that,
and let's move on, all right?

11:11.738 --> 11:13.271
Armed robbery, man.
I didn't rob no...

11:13.273 --> 11:14.739
Two to 15.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.708
And another 20
in a federal prison

11:16.710 --> 11:18.677
For illegal surveillance.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.745
Say what?

11:20.747 --> 11:22.414
But you tell me about this,

11:22.416 --> 11:26.084
And who's been following
petty officer lowry,

11:26.086 --> 11:28.920
That both your sentences
are served concurrently.

11:32.191 --> 11:35.360
Yeah, sure, I...
I know where that came from.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.761
But if you want me to talk,

11:36.763 --> 11:37.996
I want the assault charges
dropped.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.330
First. In writing.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.765
You'll tell me
where the girl is?

11:40.767 --> 11:42.767
Girl? There's no girl.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.903
He doesn't know that.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.705
I'll take you right to her.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.340
Only I know
where she at, so you need me.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.775
(laughs)

11:50.777 --> 11:52.777
You know?

11:52.779 --> 11:54.913
Lead you right to her, man.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.782
You got a day job?

11:57.784 --> 11:59.718
No.
Get one.

12:01.353 --> 12:03.188
And don't quit it.
What...?

12:03.190 --> 12:04.723
What's happening?

12:04.725 --> 12:06.291
He doesn't know who's
been following you.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.425
How can you be sure?

12:07.427 --> 12:09.327
Because gibbs is sure.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.729
And I'm definitely sure.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.731
About whatever it is
we're sure about.

12:12.733 --> 12:16.835
Well, then, I'm right on time,
because I have found intrigue.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.970
I was processing
your stolen backpack,

12:18.972 --> 12:20.839
And there was
nothing left except this.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.340
It was smooshed up
in the corner.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.775
It looks like the last page of

12:23.777 --> 12:25.777
Some sort of legal disclaimer.
It's signed

12:25.779 --> 12:27.879
By petty officer lowry,
and please note

12:27.881 --> 12:29.414
That it's signed on the same day

12:29.416 --> 12:31.382
That he started living out
his own personal 1984.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.051
Legal disclaimer?
For what?

12:33.053 --> 12:36.221
Well, that part's missing,
but this releases someone

12:36.223 --> 12:38.056
From all liability
for your...

12:38.058 --> 12:40.024
Physical and
mental trauma.
Yeah.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.427
Disability, destruction
of personal property,

12:42.429 --> 12:44.395
Mental anguish,
dismemberment, death.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.297
What exactly
did you sign up for?

12:47.933 --> 12:51.236
I have no idea.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.246
I don't remember.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.847
Try again.

13:02.849 --> 13:04.816
Fix your gaze
on your signature.

13:04.818 --> 13:08.953
Remember the feeling
of signing your name.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.489
Where you were.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.894
I'm sorry.
I got nothing.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.829
Why can't I remember?

13:17.831 --> 13:20.799
Well, the time-stamp
on this document indicates

13:20.801 --> 13:22.534
That you signed it a few hours

13:22.536 --> 13:24.402
Before your assault,

13:24.404 --> 13:27.038
In which you suffered
a serious concussion.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.540
I don't remember that, either.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.108
The only thing
I remember from that day

13:30.110 --> 13:31.843
Is my best friend,
when she picked me up

13:31.845 --> 13:32.977
From the hospital.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.546
Jimmy: You know,
it's not unusual

13:34.548 --> 13:36.147
For head-trauma victims
to lose their memory

13:36.149 --> 13:38.082
For the entire day
prior to their injuries.

13:39.351 --> 13:41.486
How's it going?
Not well.

13:41.488 --> 13:45.323
Or if it has anything to do
with the people following me.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.525
Let's try another approach.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.261
Try to recall any sights
or sounds

13:50.263 --> 13:52.864
From the day
you signed this.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.533
Odors, even.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.604
The only thing
I'm smelling is...

13:59.606 --> 14:03.174
Bleach and isopropyl alcohol...

14:03.176 --> 14:05.443
And a... Hint of citrus?

14:05.445 --> 14:07.245
Jimmy: Yeah, that's our
autopsy disinfectant.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.613
Good nose!

14:08.615 --> 14:10.248
Then again,
you are a cook.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.050
Lowry & mcgee:
Culinary specialist.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.218
Sorry.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.953
Wait a minute.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.889
I'm smelling
something else, too.

14:17.891 --> 14:18.923
(sniffing)

14:18.925 --> 14:20.258
Something familiar.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.961
Smell is remarkably powerful
at evoking memories.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.262
Yes?

14:24.264 --> 14:25.597
Paprika...

14:27.533 --> 14:29.467
...Coriander, nutmeg.

14:29.469 --> 14:33.204
Ah, you're smelling the contents

14:33.206 --> 14:36.908
Of a prior occupant's stomach.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.076
Pickled fennel?

14:38.078 --> 14:39.878
Very rare.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.613
Well, our john doe's last meal

14:41.615 --> 14:44.415
Consisted of an impressive
amount of...
Bratwurst.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.117
That's correct.

14:46.119 --> 14:50.955
Whatever I signed up for had
something to do with bratwurst.

14:50.957 --> 14:53.524
That exact blend.

14:56.629 --> 15:00.398
My favorite thing
about my job is-is the mystery.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.968
"abby, figure out
where this bratwurst came from."

15:03.970 --> 15:06.104
Ask me why.
I don't know.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.206
Ask me how this
fits into the case.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.540
I don't know.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.643
It's just...
A mystery.

15:11.645 --> 15:13.678
Yes.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.946
So what's the plan here?

15:14.948 --> 15:16.948
Well, first,

15:16.950 --> 15:19.918
I will simulate the
effects of digestive juices

15:19.920 --> 15:21.252
On a typical bratwurst protein.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.021
Then I use my mass

15:23.023 --> 15:25.490
Spectrometer to
I.D. The proteins

15:25.492 --> 15:26.925
In the sample I was given.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.993
Then I can match that
to a known brand...

15:28.995 --> 15:31.596
And the rest is "gibbstory."

15:31.598 --> 15:34.532
Hmm. How do you account
for instrument drift?

15:34.534 --> 15:38.002
Oh, I just... I tee
in a reference compound

15:38.004 --> 15:40.071
Into the main analyte flow,
and then...

15:41.941 --> 15:43.308
Hey, wait a minute.

15:43.310 --> 15:47.712
Uh, I minored
in forensic science in college.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.280
I like to keep up
with the field.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.682
I'm surprised you don't.

15:50.684 --> 15:53.051
Excuse me?

15:53.053 --> 15:54.986
Well, it's just that

15:54.988 --> 15:56.988
You're teeing in
an internal reference

15:56.990 --> 15:58.556
When you can get
much better results

15:58.558 --> 16:00.725
By using an external
electrospray probe.

16:00.727 --> 16:04.062
Don't you have some questions

16:04.064 --> 16:06.030
That you need to ask me,
or something?

16:06.032 --> 16:08.599
Oh, uh, okay, right.

16:08.601 --> 16:12.236
Uh, five months ago,
you processed a memory card

16:12.238 --> 16:15.206
That had a photo of the man
who killed tyler wilkes.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.308
Yes.
And that man was

16:17.310 --> 16:19.177
Mossad director eli david.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.079
Well, we didn't
know that at the time,

16:21.081 --> 16:23.715
Because the photos only showed
the back of his head.

16:23.717 --> 16:26.050
Oh, and...

16:26.052 --> 16:30.154
I use two separate analyte
streams for redundancy, dick.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.156
Yeah, for what that's worth.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.725
And my name is richard.

16:33.727 --> 16:36.694
Do you want to fight?
'cause I will fistfight you

16:36.696 --> 16:39.097
In your head right now.
I'm just saying...

16:39.099 --> 16:41.065
In your head, I'll...
How could you tell
it was eli david

16:41.067 --> 16:42.667
If you could only see
the back of his head?

16:42.669 --> 16:44.769
Because ziva told us
it was her father.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.005
She told you?
Well, she told gibbs.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.573
Right before eli was killed.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.108
It must have been
difficult for her.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.509
Ziva is loyal to a fault.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.044
No doubt.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.079
"to a fault" is exactly
how I'd put it.

16:55.081 --> 16:58.149
That's it. Thank you.

17:06.658 --> 17:09.093
Seems like something
one of your agents would do.

17:09.095 --> 17:12.030
Yeah, well,
can use the fresh air.

17:12.032 --> 17:13.398
Or you're avoiding that guy

17:13.400 --> 17:16.067
Who's been poking around
asking all those questions.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.736
So, any of it ring a bell?

17:20.472 --> 17:22.306
Sorry, I got nothing.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.108
But the more I smell
this number five special,

17:24.110 --> 17:26.044
The more I know it's got
something to do with all this.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.246
Three down...

17:28.248 --> 17:30.782
Six more to go.

17:32.651 --> 17:34.085
What?

17:34.087 --> 17:36.120
What? What? What?
What? What? What?

17:36.122 --> 17:38.256
B-12-- it's a
water-soluble vitamin

17:38.258 --> 17:40.258
Commonly found
in poultry and fish.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.060
That looks familiar.

17:42.062 --> 17:45.063
I think I've
been here before.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.268
Definitely been
here before.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.170
This is it! For sure!

17:52.172 --> 17:54.238
Shh! Shh! Shh.

18:16.495 --> 18:19.130
That's the guy
who's been following me!

18:19.132 --> 18:20.298
There's the bratwurst.
Gibbs:
Wait. Hold on.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.799
Hey, knock it off!
Man:
Dr. Hale!

18:21.801 --> 18:24.869
Arrest him!
Woman:
Petty officer, calm down!

18:24.871 --> 18:26.871
Evan!
Wait-- you know him?

18:26.873 --> 18:29.507
He's one of our
test subjects.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.375
Test subjects?!

18:31.377 --> 18:33.111
(sighs)

18:35.848 --> 18:38.749
Evan volunteered to be part of
the helping eyes initiative,

18:38.751 --> 18:40.551
A two-week study

18:40.553 --> 18:43.354
Examining the psychological
effects of surveillance.

18:43.356 --> 18:46.657
Between traffic cams,
drones, smart phones,

18:46.659 --> 18:48.392
We're a surveillance
society now.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.228
And the government wants to know

18:50.230 --> 18:51.896
How people react
to being watched.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.598
So they can
get better at it.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.266
Man: Terrorists are getting
better at hiding, too,

18:55.268 --> 18:58.236
So, we need
to up our game, as well.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.237
You need to avoid looking at me.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.705
Hale:
We recruited

19:00.707 --> 19:03.341
People like evan here,
who agreed to be watched,

19:03.343 --> 19:05.710
To have their mail opened,
etcetera,

19:05.712 --> 19:06.878
While we documented
the whole thing.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.679
You recorded the mugging?

19:08.681 --> 19:10.248
No, we hadn't
started yet.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.250
Evan was attacked just a few
hours after he signed up.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.451
Something I don't
remember doing.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.621
That eventually became
clear to us, yes.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.289
Gibbs:
Why didn't you

19:18.291 --> 19:20.424
Call off the test?
Are you kidding?

19:20.426 --> 19:22.660
His ignorance of
our experiment

19:22.662 --> 19:24.428
Made him the perfect
test subject.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.796
Glad you were getting your kicks

19:25.798 --> 19:28.266
While I was tearing my house
apart looking for bugs.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.200
You want to press charges?

19:29.202 --> 19:31.369
Charges?! For what?

19:31.371 --> 19:33.237
Following someone
with a video camera?

19:33.239 --> 19:34.539
Reckless endangerment.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.474
You do that,
we'll be shut down.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.276
All our work
gets confiscated,

19:38.278 --> 19:39.644
And good luck
getting your check.

19:39.646 --> 19:40.912
Check?

19:40.914 --> 19:44.649
Yes, this is a paid study.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.717
Well, now
that I think about it...

19:46.719 --> 19:48.886
It does sound kind of
interesting.

19:48.888 --> 19:53.191
Hale: You were quite excited
when you signed up.

19:53.193 --> 19:57.795
And now that you're done,
we owe you some money.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.298
Tony:
<i>15 hundred bucks! Wow.</i>

20:00.300 --> 20:01.399
So is lowry pressing charges?

20:01.401 --> 20:03.267
More importantly,
can I sign up?

20:03.269 --> 20:05.303
He is not,
and gibbs is not happy.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.238
He wants us to look
into the doctor

20:07.240 --> 20:10.675
There are a number of navy
personnel in the study.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.276
Ah. Gotcha.

20:12.278 --> 20:14.779
So, lowry's not the only one
getting the shaft?

20:15.747 --> 20:17.582
(door opens)
uh, excuse me?

20:17.584 --> 20:20.284
Agent david, have
you got a minute?

20:20.286 --> 20:21.519
You're next on my list.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.754
Conference room busy?

20:23.756 --> 20:24.956
Uh, unfortunately, it is.

20:24.958 --> 20:27.225
It was either this,
or the parking garage.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.327
This will be fine.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.362
I'll get started on the doc.

20:33.632 --> 20:35.700
(door closes)

20:37.803 --> 20:41.539
Parsons:
Well, after spending a few hours
in the car with him, I can say

20:41.541 --> 20:44.275
That agent dinozzo is
a capable investigator.

20:44.277 --> 20:47.445
Unfortunately,
he can also be quite a child.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.679
(parsons and ziva laugh)

20:48.681 --> 20:50.248
This was a mistake.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.916
Ziva: The conference room
is not busy.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.551
I was just there.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.486
No, it's not busy.

20:55.488 --> 20:58.256
So, why did you choose
this room?

20:58.258 --> 21:00.658
Are you trying to make me
uncomfortable for some reason?

21:00.660 --> 21:03.327
Are you uncomfortable...
For some reason?

21:06.298 --> 21:09.433
I have nothing to hide.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.669
I also do not have
a lot of time.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.938
Time... Time, time,
time, time, time.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.941
(sniffles, clears throat)

21:16.943 --> 21:20.745
Abby sciuto recovered photos
that indicated your father

21:20.747 --> 21:22.313
Was guilty of murder.

21:22.315 --> 21:23.447
Yes.

21:23.449 --> 21:26.584
And according to agent dinozzo,

21:26.586 --> 21:29.453
You saw those photos
before sundown.

21:29.455 --> 21:35.793
Yet you waited three
hours before you told
agent gibbs anything.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.795
That is a lot of time.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.364
Trust me.
It was better for everyone

21:40.366 --> 21:42.667
That I speak to my father first.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.402
(inhales)

21:44.404 --> 21:48.639
It certainly wasn't better
for, uh, ilan bodnar

21:48.641 --> 21:50.341
That you spoke
with him first.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.543
According
to your official report,

21:52.545 --> 21:56.347
He lost his footing
during your fight,

21:56.349 --> 21:58.816
And then fell to his death.

21:58.818 --> 21:59.950
I tried to save him.

21:59.952 --> 22:00.951
Really?

22:00.953 --> 22:02.053
You tried to save him?

22:02.055 --> 22:03.321
You tried to save the man

22:03.323 --> 22:04.889
That killed your father?
Yes!

22:04.891 --> 22:06.924
So he could answer
for his crimes.

22:10.028 --> 22:11.462
And what about yours?

22:12.364 --> 22:14.332
Adam eshel.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.867
Shin bet,
israeli security agency.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.969
Yes. Is it a crime
to have friends now?

22:18.971 --> 22:20.838
It depends.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.373
Did you sleep
with your friend?

22:22.375 --> 22:23.374
I beg your pardon?

22:23.376 --> 22:25.409
Did you sleep with him?

22:25.411 --> 22:27.111
He is a foreign national.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.679
You are a federal agent.

22:28.681 --> 22:31.048
That is a threat
to national security.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.350
Have you been following me?

22:32.352 --> 22:33.751
Answer the question!

22:33.753 --> 22:35.086
Did you sleep with him?

22:35.088 --> 22:36.053
Go to hell!

22:37.089 --> 22:38.356
Interview is over.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.557
You don't have the authority.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.558
It's over.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.792
Two seconds ago.

22:41.794 --> 22:42.860
Door.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.834
(sniffs)

22:49.836 --> 22:51.902
(clears throat)

22:55.140 --> 22:57.141
You can keep the photo
of your boyfriend.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.480
So.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.148
Over.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.416
Ten seconds ago.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.025
Man (over tv): Tonight,
the fire department responded

23:15.027 --> 23:16.894
To a three-alarm blaze
after an explosion...

23:16.896 --> 23:19.663
Gibbs, we may
have a problem...

23:19.665 --> 23:21.799
We do.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.401
Mcgee: There was an
explosion at the office

23:23.403 --> 23:26.470
Running the experiment
lowry had signed up for.

23:26.472 --> 23:28.439
That's a hell of a coincidence.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.508
Yeah.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.076
Isn't it?

23:45.791 --> 23:47.425
You talk to gibbs yet?

23:47.427 --> 23:49.927
About what?

23:49.929 --> 23:51.662
About your interrogation.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.664
There is nothing to talk about.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.033
Parsons is simply conducting
a routine investigation.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.435
You told him to go to hell.

23:57.437 --> 23:58.736
Does not mean
I have to like it.

23:58.738 --> 23:59.737
But I have nothing to hide.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.639
So, then,
national security isn't

24:01.641 --> 24:03.040
Threatened by you and...?

24:03.042 --> 24:04.542
Adam?

24:04.544 --> 24:06.076
Now you're asking the questions.

24:06.078 --> 24:09.914
With the possibility
of a question mark at the end.

24:11.883 --> 24:14.785
I went to israel
to bury my father.

24:14.787 --> 24:18.122
It was a moment of weakness.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.791
I felt alone.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.561
You need to talk to legal.

24:23.563 --> 24:25.629
No, I don't.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.599
My hebrew must not be
as good as I thought,

24:28.601 --> 24:30.634
Because I could've sworn
that when I dropped you off

24:30.636 --> 24:32.770
At the airport,
I told you you were not alone.

24:35.674 --> 24:38.108
Yes, you did.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.911
Well, then...

24:40.913 --> 24:44.081
We must have
different interpretations.

24:55.627 --> 24:57.228
What's cooking?

24:57.230 --> 24:58.796
Fuse box.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.664
Chief said that's
where the fire started.

25:00.666 --> 25:01.899
Someone was messing
with the breaker panel

25:01.901 --> 25:03.501
Feeding into the office.

25:03.503 --> 25:05.870
Caused every computer
in the suite to blow out.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.805
All of dr. Hale's data,

25:07.807 --> 25:09.840
All of her video surveillance,
it's all gone.

25:12.978 --> 25:14.578
Interesting.

25:15.814 --> 25:17.681
Where's hale?

25:17.683 --> 25:18.782
Ziva: According to
the first responders,

25:18.784 --> 25:22.586
She was taken to the hospital
with minor burns.

25:22.588 --> 25:23.754
Lucky.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.022
And by that, I mean convenient.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.191
Find out which.
I'll talk to her.

25:27.193 --> 25:30.027
Ziva, mcgee, background on
the doctor's test subjects.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.795
Everybody she was following.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.864
(phone rings)

25:33.866 --> 25:37.067
Jethro, I apologize
for the timing,

25:37.069 --> 25:39.870
But I just completed
my interview with mr. Parsons.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.071
Yeah, and...?

25:41.073 --> 25:43.140
We have a problem.

25:45.076 --> 25:46.677
Gibbs:
<i>Let's hear it.</i>

25:46.679 --> 25:48.812
Ducky: <i>I do not believe</i>
<i>that our seemingly</i>

25:48.814 --> 25:51.181
Innocent interrogator is here

25:51.183 --> 25:53.751
Simply to dot
the I's and cross the t's.

25:53.753 --> 25:55.886
I got that impression, too.
What do you think, ziva?

25:58.323 --> 26:00.157
Gibbs:
Okay.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.559
Let's hear it.

26:02.327 --> 26:04.328
It is nothing.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.796
Parsons just got a little

26:05.798 --> 26:07.932
Aggressive with me
during the interview.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.568
It is not nothing, ziva.

26:10.570 --> 26:11.769
Given the interview
I just had,

26:11.771 --> 26:13.837
I believe the man
is out for blood.

26:13.839 --> 26:14.905
Yours.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.874
Abby:
I knew that guy was trouble.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.742
He's like an evil mcgee.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.911
He left this photograph.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.013
Do you recognize
that man, ziva?

26:23.015 --> 26:24.915
No.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.083
Michael fassbender?

26:26.085 --> 26:28.886
Shmeil pinkhas.

26:31.923 --> 26:33.824
I can see it in his eyes.

26:33.826 --> 26:38.996
That mr. Pinkhas once worked
for the israeli government?

26:38.998 --> 26:40.931
Shmeil?

26:40.933 --> 26:42.366
No, that's impossible.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.868
Well, according
to parsons, he was

26:44.870 --> 26:47.237
Briefly in their employ
for an operation

26:47.239 --> 26:49.707
That began in 1972.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.275
September, to be precise.

26:52.777 --> 26:53.944
Munich.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.113
Tony:
Mm. Just like the movie.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.282
Shmeil, played by eric bana.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.950
Well, what does that
have to do with ziva?

26:59.952 --> 27:02.786
Well, parsons was interested
in her repeated contact

27:02.788 --> 27:06.123
With a former israeli
black bag operative.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.659
He also wanted
to know if I was aware

27:08.661 --> 27:09.660
Of her relationship

27:09.662 --> 27:10.961
With adam eshel.

27:10.963 --> 27:11.962
He's fishing.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.063
He's questioning her loyalty.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.331
Yes.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.332
To what?

27:15.334 --> 27:16.667
Ducky:
Ncis.

27:16.669 --> 27:18.736
And her adopted country.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.304
Does he think I'm a spy
or something?

27:20.306 --> 27:22.973
I have no idea what
his endgame is.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.909
Nor what is motivating him,

27:25.911 --> 27:29.313
But it is clear
this is a witch hunt.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.181
What the hell are we
gonna do about this?

27:33.752 --> 27:34.985
Sorry, I-I'm miffed.

27:34.987 --> 27:35.986
Ducky:
Well...

27:35.988 --> 27:37.988
I fear we just have to wait

27:37.990 --> 27:40.424
Until the dealer
shows his full hand.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.026
Waiting isn't even

27:42.028 --> 27:44.261
One of the top hundred
things I'm good at.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.696
And we're not gonna wait.

27:46.765 --> 27:48.198
We're gonna count.

27:50.101 --> 27:51.301
Cards.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.437
See what's left
in parsons' deck.

27:56.941 --> 27:58.976
I love watching you hack.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.045
Don't tell anyone
I said that.
Don't worry,

28:01.047 --> 28:04.048
I won't. But technically,
I haven't hacked anything yet.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.684
Ncis already has access
to the dod database

28:06.686 --> 28:08.318
With parsons' case files.
What do you got?

28:08.320 --> 28:10.387
Well, it looks like a collection
of all the paperwork

28:10.389 --> 28:11.955
On eli david and bodnar.

28:11.957 --> 28:13.891
That tells us nothing.
We wrote most of it.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.694
Mcgee:
Hold on a minute.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.096
There's a locked file here from
the u.S. Justice department.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.165
Is parsons actually
going for an indictment?

28:21.167 --> 28:22.700
Who is he talking to at justice?

28:22.702 --> 28:24.068
That may be a tough hack, boss.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.870
I'd have to bypass the
external firewall, but...

28:26.872 --> 28:29.139
(whistles quietly)

28:31.009 --> 28:33.043
Investigators believe that,
while the power surge in

28:33.045 --> 28:35.012
Dr. Hale's office
was intentional,

28:35.014 --> 28:36.413
The resulting fire was not.

28:36.415 --> 28:40.184
Test subjects--
all accounted for but one:

28:40.186 --> 28:41.719
Simon gravy.

28:41.721 --> 28:42.886
A civilian.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.088
Manages a shoe store.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.389
Where is he?

28:45.391 --> 28:46.890
He disappeared
after the explosion,

28:46.892 --> 28:48.325
And I'm gonna go
with suspicious.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.727
Mcgee: There's no activity
from his cell phone.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.228
Checking his bank account.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.031
Ziva: We'll put out a bolo,
but we may have

28:54.033 --> 28:56.800
Hale told me she made
weekly backups

28:56.802 --> 28:59.503
Mcgee: They were recording
simon for a while.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.438
There might be something there
that'll tell us

29:01.440 --> 29:03.407
Where he's hiding.
Go.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.210
Ziva, look at
that lead from mcgee.

29:06.212 --> 29:09.079
On it. I have some friends
I can talk to.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.183
You want to talk?

29:14.819 --> 29:17.955
Ready when you are.

29:17.957 --> 29:20.424
It's good to know.

29:20.426 --> 29:24.495
But I'm afraid you're gonna
have to wait your turn.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.769
(door opens)

29:31.771 --> 29:33.137
What'd I miss?

29:33.139 --> 29:35.239
You were only gone
two minutes.

29:35.241 --> 29:36.907
It felt like two hours.

29:36.909 --> 29:38.542
God, this is so addicting.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.344
Does he floss?

29:40.346 --> 29:42.112
He seems like a flosser.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.914
What are those meds
he's taking?

29:43.916 --> 29:45.482
(groans)

29:45.484 --> 29:47.785
(grunts, sighs)

29:47.787 --> 29:51.088
I like moving images.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.223
And I could use
a diversion right now.

29:55.059 --> 29:56.426
When the cereal's gone,

29:56.428 --> 29:58.328
He doesn't drink
the rest of the milk.
(sputters)

29:58.330 --> 29:59.997
That's such a simon move.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.532
If you know him so well,
how about

30:01.534 --> 30:02.566
Figuring out where he's hiding.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.134
Assuming he's not dead.

30:04.136 --> 30:08.105
Tony, the problem with
a study like this is,

30:08.107 --> 30:09.540
Simon may have signed up
to be followed,

30:09.542 --> 30:11.008
But that doesn't mean
everyone he met

30:11.010 --> 30:12.009
Wanted to be filmed.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.410
What's your point?

30:13.412 --> 30:16.079
Well, he could have a
buddy who's a drug dealer.

30:16.081 --> 30:18.115
Drug dealers tend to
not like being recorded.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.117
Simon doesn't have
any buddies.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.218
He has a cat.
(chuckles)

30:21.220 --> 30:23.854
He spends all of
his time by himself.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.455
At the aquarium.
Did we mark that down?

30:25.457 --> 30:29.026
Yup, already
expanded the bolo.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.861
Kind of sad.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.462
What a waste of
an 802.11-enabled

30:32.464 --> 30:34.832
Trojan horse code planter.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.266
What a waste of words.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.168
What?

30:38.170 --> 30:42.206
It survived the fire
in dr. Hale's lab.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.574
It remotely installs
an application

30:43.576 --> 30:46.043
On smart phones that
turns the cell into a bug.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.211
That could come in handy.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.980
Instead of having to
plant an actual bug,

30:49.982 --> 30:51.548
All you need to do
is get close enough

30:51.550 --> 30:52.549
And hit that button.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.184
Well, keep it away from me.

30:54.186 --> 30:58.889
(doorbell buzzing)
last thing I want
to do is to hear you...

30:58.891 --> 31:00.891
(knocking on door, tony groans)

31:00.893 --> 31:03.227
(buzzing, knocking)
if this is dorneget,
I swear to god...

31:03.229 --> 31:05.329
(knocking continues)

31:05.331 --> 31:07.865
Oh. What's wrong?

31:07.867 --> 31:09.466
I was locked out,
that's what's wrong.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.134
I was coming to brief you
on what I learned

31:11.136 --> 31:13.604
But when I tried
to open the door,

31:13.606 --> 31:14.872
My retina scan was denied.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.073
Hmm.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.141
(typing)

31:21.179 --> 31:23.347
Your security clearance
has been suspended.

31:23.349 --> 31:24.581
Parsons.

31:24.583 --> 31:25.582
You brief mcgee.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.217
I'll go tell gibbs.

31:46.371 --> 31:47.905
(sighs)

31:47.907 --> 31:49.072
(grunts)

31:49.074 --> 31:51.642
Almost missed it.

31:51.644 --> 31:54.211
Ah. Going down.

31:57.015 --> 31:59.483
Were you able to find out
anything on that locked file?

31:59.485 --> 32:01.451
Not specifically.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.654
But my contact at justice
gave me this list

32:03.656 --> 32:05.355
Of all the files parsons
has been accessing.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.224
Most of them from
the ncis archives.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.393
What's he doing
going through our archives?

32:09.395 --> 32:11.428
Tony:
<i>You must have a pretty</i>
<i>warped sense of humor.</i>

32:11.430 --> 32:14.665
Probably the kind of guy
that thinks the laugh track

32:14.667 --> 32:16.600
On   <i>sports night</i>
<i>made it funnier.</i>

32:16.602 --> 32:19.937
So, this is how you do it, huh?

32:19.939 --> 32:21.271
I got you.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.607
Just play it cool,
wait for a reaction?

32:23.609 --> 32:26.276
Hey, I got one for you.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.611
(elevator clanks, powers down)

32:27.613 --> 32:29.346
What's that tell you?

32:31.316 --> 32:33.250
That you're afraid.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.585
Ziva:
<i>Parsons has been pulling</i>

32:35.587 --> 32:37.354
Hundreds of case files.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.325
Some of these files are from
before you even got here.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.660
Tony: <i>You're messing</i>
<i>with the wrong federal agents.</i>

32:43.662 --> 32:46.196
You can question
how we do things,

32:46.198 --> 32:48.632
But don't ever question
the loyalty of ziva david.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.969
Even if she dissed you and
slept with some stranger?

32:51.971 --> 32:54.071
(laughs)

32:54.073 --> 32:56.340
You're gonna poke the bear, huh?

32:56.342 --> 32:58.008
It's effective.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.309
Until the bear eats you.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.346
For going after
the bear's best friend.

33:04.515 --> 33:07.718
What makes you think
I'm going after ziva?

33:10.588 --> 33:12.322
(elevator clanks, whirrs)

33:12.324 --> 33:15.392
Mcgee, there's only one person
these files have in common.

33:15.394 --> 33:16.493
Vance.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.563
Parsons is not after me.

33:19.565 --> 33:22.265
He's going after the director.

33:29.674 --> 33:33.143
If parsons is compiling
my greatest hits,

33:33.145 --> 33:35.145
Then why put
the screws to david?

33:35.147 --> 33:36.613
Leverage.

33:36.615 --> 33:40.283
We believe he's hoping
to get me to flip.

33:40.285 --> 33:42.119
Perhaps to bring
to light some aspects

33:42.121 --> 33:43.520
Of our hunt
for bodnar that were...

33:43.522 --> 33:46.056
Icy.
Dicey.

33:46.058 --> 33:48.091
We had our reasons.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.093
Yes, we did.

33:50.095 --> 33:52.362
As director, though...

33:52.364 --> 33:54.531
It's only right
that this should fall on me.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.234
I've been doing
some checking.

33:57.236 --> 34:00.504
Parsons is a rising star
in the dc private legal sector.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.672
He's trying to make
a name for himself.

34:02.674 --> 34:03.707
Not if we can help it.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.475
Tony: We'll know
if he makes a move.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.144
We've got ears to the ground,

34:07.146 --> 34:10.113
And, maybe, accidentally,
trojan-horse style

34:10.115 --> 34:11.715
Listening apps
on his phone?

34:11.717 --> 34:13.750
You bugged parsons?

34:13.752 --> 34:15.452
We shared an elevator.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.487
I forgot it was in my pocket.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.656
Vance: I appreciate
that you've got my back,

34:19.658 --> 34:21.158
But there are some things, uh,

34:21.160 --> 34:22.759
You should keep me
in the dark about.

34:23.761 --> 34:24.761
Sorry I'm late.

34:24.763 --> 34:27.264
Didn't you get my text?
Just now.

34:27.266 --> 34:29.466
There's no personal
cell phones in mtac, remember?

34:30.501 --> 34:32.536
What, am I the only one
that follows that rule?

34:32.538 --> 34:37.174
Bolo came back on simon gravy,
our suspected arsonist.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.208
Aquarium?
Yup.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.109
We got him.

34:44.282 --> 34:47.184
Best way to stay under parsons'
radar is to keep working.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.086
Keep me informed.

34:49.088 --> 34:52.656
Meantime, I'm gonna call in
some favors.

34:56.694 --> 34:59.796
That's about how I feel
right now.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.798
The simon show seem different
to you?

35:01.800 --> 35:04.101
Is he on new meds or something?

35:04.103 --> 35:06.336
Looks more like
he's <i>off</i> his meds.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.105
Hey. Hey!

35:08.107 --> 35:09.639
Personal space, mcgrope.

35:09.641 --> 35:10.874
(grunts)
sorry.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.442
Only available outlet.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.610
In the building?

35:13.612 --> 35:15.745
The server in here
is on its own network.

35:15.747 --> 35:18.315
I do not want the signal
from parsons' phone

35:18.317 --> 35:19.516
Being traced to my desk.

35:19.518 --> 35:21.585
Don't worry.
I'll be quiet.

35:27.592 --> 35:31.461
You signed up for a study
that watches you 24/7.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.630
And then
you fell off the grid.

35:33.632 --> 35:37.267
No cell, no credit cards.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.269
Emptied your bank account
an hour ago.

35:39.271 --> 35:40.637
You going somewhere, simon?

35:40.639 --> 35:41.705
(laughs)

35:41.707 --> 35:44.307
(chuckles)

35:44.309 --> 35:46.610
Oh, somebody cares!

35:46.612 --> 35:47.811
Definitely off his meds.

35:47.813 --> 35:50.347
Not exactly
gibbs' specialty.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.249
Well, yeah, I signed up
for that study.

35:52.251 --> 35:53.750
I needed the cash.

35:53.752 --> 35:55.285
Then you changed your mind.

35:55.287 --> 35:56.820
Why'd you disappear?

35:56.822 --> 35:58.421
It's none of your business.

35:58.423 --> 36:00.624
Actually, yeah,
it is my business.

36:00.626 --> 36:05.362
The building with your
surveillance tapes was torched.

36:05.364 --> 36:06.663
(laughing)

36:06.665 --> 36:08.632
Oh, isn't that
just the icing on the cake!

36:08.634 --> 36:09.733
You know who did this?

36:09.735 --> 36:11.501
Yeah, I do,
but it doesn't really matter

36:11.503 --> 36:12.836
'cause you're never
gonna find him.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.704
It does matter.

36:14.706 --> 36:17.474
Talk, or it's
accessory-after-the-fact.

36:17.476 --> 36:19.943
God.

36:19.945 --> 36:21.912
God burned down
that building.

36:21.914 --> 36:23.547
Why were you running?

36:23.549 --> 36:26.516
Worthless I really am!
Why were you running?

36:26.518 --> 36:28.451
Because I hate my life!

36:30.855 --> 36:32.689
It's like an episode
of   <i>bipolar intervention.</i>

36:32.691 --> 36:34.791
Simon: I haven't had
a steady job in...

36:34.793 --> 36:36.726
See?
...Two years.

36:36.728 --> 36:39.963
I don't have any friends,
let alone a girlfriend.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.666
Driving my '99 miata

36:42.668 --> 36:44.668
To beltway burgers
on Wednesday night

36:44.670 --> 36:46.603
Is what passes
for my social life.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.705
I needed a fresh start, okay?

36:48.707 --> 36:53.343
Yeah, I met someone
who didn't like being recorded.

36:53.345 --> 36:55.345
It was me.

36:55.347 --> 36:57.881
Before, I could pretend
that I wasn't worthless,

36:57.883 --> 37:00.383
But once the cameras
started rolling, I realized

37:00.385 --> 37:02.519
How I must look on tape.

37:02.521 --> 37:03.753
You destroyed the footage.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.722
God, you're not listening.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.923
It wasn't me.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.992
Yesterday was Wednesday.

37:08.994 --> 37:11.728
I was at beltway burgers
all night, remember?

37:11.730 --> 37:12.896
Go ahead and check.

37:12.898 --> 37:16.533
I'm sorry, I don't know
who did this,

37:16.535 --> 37:19.703
But I doubt
it was someone in the study.

37:19.705 --> 37:22.606
What kind of an idiot would get
into trouble knowing there was

37:22.608 --> 37:24.674
A camera crew
following him around?

37:26.611 --> 37:28.678
Someone who didn't remember.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.385
Petty officer lowry.

37:35.387 --> 37:37.020
Agent gibbs.

37:37.022 --> 37:38.555
You should have called.

37:38.557 --> 37:40.023
I'm kind of in the
middle of lunch.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.728
Are you going to introduce me?

37:44.730 --> 37:46.896
Uh...

37:46.898 --> 37:48.798
Sure.

37:48.800 --> 37:52.269
Agent gibbs, this is,
uh, stella and abner.

37:52.271 --> 37:54.971
He's a cutie,
and he has his mother's eyes.

37:54.973 --> 37:57.007
Agent gibbs, is it?

37:57.009 --> 37:58.775
Nice to meet you.

37:58.777 --> 37:59.809
Likewise.

37:59.811 --> 38:00.977
Corporal.

38:06.917 --> 38:09.753
We went through all your tapes.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.821
We ran facial recognition
on everyone you met

38:11.823 --> 38:13.323
While you were being followed.

38:13.325 --> 38:14.591
She popped up.

38:14.593 --> 38:16.693
You're ua, corporal.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.762
Ziva: And you've been
helping her hide.

38:18.764 --> 38:20.964
Which is why you caused
that fire-- to protect her.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.766
Fire?
What's going on, evan?

38:22.768 --> 38:24.034
Petty officer lowry

38:24.036 --> 38:25.302
Signed up to
be followed

38:25.304 --> 38:26.636
For a psych experiment.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.004
You only had
to remember one thing.

38:28.006 --> 38:32.676
From your oldest friend in
the world until it was done.

38:35.780 --> 38:38.748
But I didn't remember.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.718
When we found dr. Hale,

38:41.720 --> 38:44.087
I realized I led the cameras
right to stella.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.955
Then got ncis involved.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.757
If her face flagged
in the system...

38:47.759 --> 38:48.792
She would have been caught.

38:48.794 --> 38:51.661
What did you do, evan?

38:53.631 --> 38:56.700
She didn't know,
agent gibbs.

38:56.702 --> 38:59.636
And the fire wasn't
supposed to happen.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.738
I was just trying
to wipe any record of stella

39:01.740 --> 39:03.340
From the servers.

39:03.342 --> 39:04.874
I was trying to make it right.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.412
Yeah. I know.

39:15.953 --> 39:18.521
Lowry:
I'm so sorry, stella.

39:26.797 --> 39:28.798
I'm a dedicated marine, sir.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.368
As dedicated as they come.
I read your file.

39:31.370 --> 39:34.738
But after I had abner,
things changed.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.974
Last month, I got orders
for a third tour.

39:37.976 --> 39:40.377
Afghanistan.

39:40.379 --> 39:42.779
Evan was just trying
to protect us.

39:43.948 --> 39:47.817
Haven't you ever bent the rules
to protect a friend?

39:51.989 --> 39:55.091
(muffled jazz playing)

39:55.093 --> 39:57.160
(jazz blaring)

40:01.465 --> 40:02.899
(music stops)

40:02.901 --> 40:04.834
Like having
your own office?
A little.

40:04.836 --> 40:06.903
Okay, a lot.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.406
I love it. I never get to
listen to my own music out loud.

40:09.408 --> 40:11.841
Or live in your own filth.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.512
(sniffing)

40:15.514 --> 40:18.481
So, what's the scoop
with parsons?

40:18.483 --> 40:20.116
Well, I've been
listening all day.

40:20.118 --> 40:22.685
He, uh, had a few meetings
at the pentagon,

40:22.687 --> 40:24.087
Made some calls,
but nothing revealing.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.588
Where is he now?

40:25.590 --> 40:28.091
He's down in the lobby.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.160
He's making a phone call.

40:37.902 --> 40:40.170
What?

40:41.939 --> 40:44.507
What did he say?!

40:44.509 --> 40:47.143
Boss, we got a problem!

40:47.145 --> 40:49.145
What's the matter now, mcgee?

40:49.147 --> 40:50.613
We had it wrong.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.115
Bodnar's only part of this.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.017
Parsons isn't after
ziva or vance.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.652
(elevator bell chimes)
he...

41:12.203 --> 41:13.837
That's a lot of manpower.

41:13.839 --> 41:16.072
Your reputation proceeds you.

41:18.175 --> 41:20.910
Don't act too surprised.

41:20.912 --> 41:24.547
Or did I not give you
enough time to prepare?

41:25.850 --> 41:28.051
Gibbs:
You got something to say,

41:28.053 --> 41:29.853
Say it.

41:29.855 --> 41:32.989
Special agent
leroy jethro gibbs,

41:32.991 --> 41:36.125
You've manipulated evidence,
and you've obstructed justice.

41:36.127 --> 41:39.762
Do you take full responsibility
for the actions of your team?

41:41.832 --> 41:44.167
What do you think?

41:44.169 --> 41:46.202
