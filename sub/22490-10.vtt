00:19.152 --> 00:20.983
It's alive!

00:43.476 --> 00:45.910
Oh! I want my sundae.

01:05.999 --> 01:09.025
- Where the hell have you been?
- It's none of your business.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.128
None of my business?
It isn't my business that...

01:11.171 --> 01:13.162
Are you really a tooth fairy?

01:13.206 --> 01:14.571
Um, yeah.

01:14.607 --> 01:15.767
Damn right it isn't.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.367
Maybe you'd rather be
with your whore.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.968
Don't you dare call her that!

01:19.012 --> 01:21.344
You admit it!
You unbelievable bastard.

01:21.381 --> 01:22.643
That is it!

01:22.682 --> 01:24.513
I'm gonna shut you up
once and for all.

01:24.551 --> 01:25.643
You put that down!

01:25.685 --> 01:27.016
Get your hands off me!
You get out!

01:31.558 --> 01:33.685
Who the hell are you?

01:33.726 --> 01:35.057
Get off me. Get off me.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.647
You be good now.

01:59.819 --> 02:02.515
You admit it!
You unbelievable bastard!

02:02.555 --> 02:03.715
That is it!

02:03.756 --> 02:05.417
I'm gonna shut you up
once and for all.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.619
- You put that down!
- Get your hands off me!

02:12.031 --> 02:13.521
Who the hell are you?

02:24.878 --> 02:28.006
Hey, champ. Uh, OK.

02:28.047 --> 02:30.515
Pack up. You and me
are going on a vacation...

02:30.550 --> 02:32.575
uh, to Disneyland.

02:32.619 --> 02:34.018
Is Mom coming?

02:34.053 --> 02:35.577
Disneyland!

02:37.490 --> 02:39.355
I'm gonna shut you up
once and for all!

02:39.392 --> 02:41.587
- You put that down!
- Get your hands off me.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.062
Who the hell are you?

02:47.100 --> 02:48.590
Hey, get off me.

02:58.811 --> 02:59.869
Freeze!

02:59.913 --> 03:02.404
Freeze? When I drop a fairy?

03:02.448 --> 03:05.008
You know I am only
getting started, motherf...

03:05.051 --> 03:06.780
Hey! Sir, put down the weapon.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.150
Put down the weapon.

03:10.590 --> 03:11.648
Stay down!

03:11.691 --> 03:13.090
On the ground! Spread your legs.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.822
Don't move. Put your hands
behind your back, sir.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.140
Congratulations!

03:34.180 --> 03:37.445
This is the darkest sketch
in television history!

03:37.483 --> 03:40.611
Darkest sketch!
Darkest sketch! Darkest sketch!

03:44.023 --> 03:46.150
I did it!
Did you guys get that?

03:47.594 --> 03:49.084
Darling, will you marry me?

04:00.974 --> 04:02.839
Uh, folks, this is
your captain speaking.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.274
Sorry for the little bump.

04:04.310 --> 04:07.404
We're just going through
a little turbulence...

04:07.447 --> 04:09.244
and there's nothing
to worry about.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.546
This is actually
my first time flying...

04:11.584 --> 04:13.142
and I'm pretty nervous.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.086
Oh, don't be.
I fly all the time.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.281
It's the safest way to travel.

04:20.726 --> 04:23.059
This is the captain again.
Well, folks...

04:23.096 --> 04:26.554
the copilot just won't stop
touching my wheel.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.294
He's really annoying.

04:28.334 --> 04:31.201
Folks, this is the copilot,
and it's not his wheel.

04:31.237 --> 04:34.968
It's the airline's wheel,
and I can touch it if I want to.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.339
That doesn't sound good.

04:38.711 --> 04:40.144
Let go of my hands!

04:40.179 --> 04:42.306
Why are you hitting yourself?
Stop hitting yourself.

04:42.348 --> 04:44.009
Hi!

04:45.285 --> 04:47.446
Excuse me, Mr. Chicken,
but can you tell me...

04:47.487 --> 04:48.749
why you crossed the road?

04:48.788 --> 04:51.689
Why, sure, Billy.
I'll tell you.

04:57.163 --> 05:01.930
Don't let this car in.
What... what are you...

05:01.968 --> 05:03.299
I have to.

05:03.336 --> 05:05.804
It's common courtesy.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.806
This traffic is ridiculous.

05:07.840 --> 05:11.469
I knew I should've taken
my teleporter to work today.

05:11.511 --> 05:13.240
I have a teleporter, you know.

05:13.279 --> 05:14.712
I invented it myself.

05:14.747 --> 05:17.215
Blah, blah, blee, blah.

05:17.250 --> 05:20.981
And yet every day,
you carpool with us.

05:21.020 --> 05:24.319
Uhh! We're in the slowest lane!

05:24.357 --> 05:27.884
Oh! This minivan
in front of us is killing me!

05:27.927 --> 05:33.797
Ooh. An honor student at
the Fancher Elementary School.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.460
Note to self...

05:35.501 --> 05:39.460
blow up
Fancher Elementary School!

05:41.307 --> 05:45.971
This is unacceptable!

06:05.898 --> 06:08.196
You missed the kids.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.065
That was a good one.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.040
What was a good...

06:17.643 --> 06:19.873
It's burning my eyes!

06:19.912 --> 06:21.072
They're watering.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.446
Unlock the windows!

06:23.483 --> 06:28.318
Behold the gaseous stench
of Skeletor's breakfast burrito!

06:30.590 --> 06:32.888
Oh, crap.

06:32.925 --> 06:34.859
OK, OK. Don't look at them.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.452
Just act casual.

06:36.496 --> 06:37.485
Oh, yeah!

06:37.530 --> 06:38.997
In your face, villains.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.631
This is exit 32. Merge over.

06:44.670 --> 06:47.935
Yeah, I'm signaling,
but they won't let me in.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.875
It's common courtesy!

06:55.515 --> 06:59.212
We are so late, man.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.810
Oh, there's a spot!

07:04.123 --> 07:07.786
To hell with this.
I'm teleporting.

07:08.995 --> 07:12.522
Wow. He really did
have a teleporter.

07:13.833 --> 07:14.891
What the...

07:16.269 --> 07:17.930
- Baldy! Baldy!
- Baldy! Baldy!

07:17.970 --> 07:19.460
Son of a bitch.

07:19.505 --> 07:20.995
You don't have any hair.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.406
Happy, happy, happy,
happy, happy, happy birthday

07:23.443 --> 07:25.775
Happy, happy birthday,
happy birthday, happy birthday

07:25.812 --> 07:28.838
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you

07:31.751 --> 07:34.686
Is everyone ready for more
of those hysterical bloopers?

07:36.022 --> 07:38.422
You know, <i>The Today Show</i>
has been a trusted source...

07:38.458 --> 07:41.256
of morning news
for more than fifty years...

07:41.294 --> 07:43.455
but it's not always boring.

07:43.496 --> 07:44.895
Just watch!

07:44.931 --> 07:47.195
And sadly,
Ling-Ling the panda...

07:47.233 --> 07:49.701
was destroyed by federal
wildlife officials.

07:49.735 --> 07:51.168
In a related story...

07:54.040 --> 07:55.598
In a related story...

07:55.641 --> 07:57.506
traffic on New York City's
Brooklyn Bridge...

07:57.543 --> 07:59.170
was brought
to a standstill today...

08:03.115 --> 08:04.776
Traffic was brought to...

08:06.452 --> 08:07.885
Hi, Katie.

08:09.088 --> 08:12.251
Someone get the Windex.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.885
Everyone remembers
<i>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.</i>

08:14.927 --> 08:18.124
But things weren't always
hunky-dory in the hood.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.132
Do you know what sharing is?

08:20.166 --> 08:21.793
Sometimes it's nice to...

08:23.269 --> 08:25.464
Peter, come over here, please.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.939
The train track
is too close to the lake.

08:27.974 --> 08:30.534
I got a shock. Weren't we
gonna solve this problem?

08:30.576 --> 08:34.171
I'm sorry. It's just that,
you know, the lake is...

08:34.212 --> 08:35.804
We're solving
the problem, Peter.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.817
Solving the problem.
Solving the problem.

08:40.219 --> 08:41.982
Solving the problem.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.450
And problem solved.

08:45.491 --> 08:49.359
Now get ready for one of the
biggest bloopers of all time!

08:49.395 --> 08:50.419
This just in...

08:50.463 --> 08:53.193
CNN calls the state of Florida
for Al Gore.

08:53.232 --> 08:56.690
That means gore has won
the presidential election.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.294
Thank you, Jesus.

08:58.337 --> 08:59.861
We sure dodged that bullet.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.100
Oops.

09:01.140 --> 09:05.770
The top-rated <i>CSI</i>
is full of twists and turns...

09:05.811 --> 09:09.645
as well as its share
of unexpected blooper action!

09:12.718 --> 09:15.346
You guys! Aw, that was...
that was really funny.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.687
Oh, [Bleep].
I [Bleep] cut myself.

09:18.724 --> 09:21.887
It's really bad. It's deep.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.225
[Bleep]

09:23.262 --> 09:24.286
Ow.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.161
This bullet casing
shouldn't be here...

09:26.198 --> 09:29.463
if the shooting
took place ten meters west.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.400
Sorry. That was me.

09:33.439 --> 09:34.736
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.799
I'm sorry. Sorry.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.343
Sorry about that.

09:39.378 --> 09:42.677
Now it's time for those
amazing sports bloopers.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.615
They're always a home run.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.482
Yeah!

10:24.323 --> 10:27.121
That's all for today,
but come back next time...

10:27.159 --> 10:30.959
for more of those
ca-razy bloopers!
