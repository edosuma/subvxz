the most beautiful angle

11:44.370 --> 11:46.238
something completely different,

I made it flow

11:56.982 --> 11:58.684
{\an3}It was more of

36:05.663 --> 36:09.166
It's just beautiful.

36:09.233 --> 36:10.768
- We've got a tough road ahead

36:10.835 --> 36:12.436
to figure out who's
gonna win this bad boy.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.772
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Blake's is a solid piece.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.607
- I didn't see any lines
that were shaky.

36:16.674 --> 36:19.343
- But the color blends,
it's questionable.

36:19.410 --> 36:20.945
- He didn't
leave any skin breaks.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.414
White highlights
bring it out right now,

36:23.481 --> 36:26.284
but after it's healed, I think
those are gonna fade away.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.585
- The white highlights
are gone.

36:27.652 --> 36:28.953
- And it's just
gonna seem super dark.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.122
- I really like
the dynamics in Kelly's piece.

36:31.188 --> 36:33.124
- It's gonna heal just
like it looks right now.

36:33.190 --> 36:34.292
- Right, right.
- You're still gonna see

36:34.358 --> 36:35.293
the skin breaks,
you're still gonna see

36:35.359 --> 36:36.794
the highlighted areas.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.030
- But I think the micro
portrait's very touch and go.

36:39.096 --> 36:40.998
Time will tell on that
to see how well it holds up.

36:41.065 --> 36:43.167
But overall,
they're both very solid pieces.

36:43.234 --> 36:45.369
{\an8}<i>♪ ♪</i>

36:45.436 --> 36:48.639
- I really expected both of
these artists to do new school.

36:48.706 --> 36:51.943
- I do feel like Kelly proved
how versatile she truly is.

36:52.009 --> 36:53.477
- She can do anything.

36:53.544 --> 36:56.514
- How do you feel like
the small portrait

36:56.581 --> 36:58.049
is gonna age over time?

36:58.115 --> 37:00.284
- Usually, I would say that
that was a very poor choice.

37:00.351 --> 37:02.787
But the way that she kept
it so minimal

37:02.853 --> 37:04.855
with almost zero
shading in the face,

37:04.922 --> 37:08.225
she didn't do gray wash
or anything complicated

37:08.292 --> 37:09.894
that could blur over time.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.563
- My main anatomical critique
was really just

37:12.630 --> 37:14.465
the actual shape
of the feet were a little

37:14.532 --> 37:16.834
too round, and that may have
been one of the last

37:16.901 --> 37:18.336
things that she had tattooed.

37:18.402 --> 37:21.205
But I do feel like Blake's
looks a little more finished

37:21.272 --> 37:23.975
and looks just
more readable overall.

37:24.041 --> 37:25.810
- I love how much character
is in this tattoo.

37:25.876 --> 37:26.944
- It's a charming tattoo.

37:27.011 --> 37:28.346
- It is super charming.

37:28.412 --> 37:29.880
- He made that
girl a furry beast.

37:29.947 --> 37:31.282
I'm like, yes.

37:31.349 --> 37:32.683
- I'm just, I'm gonna be
honest.

37:32.750 --> 37:35.553
The drawing, the proportions,
they're skewed.

37:35.620 --> 37:38.456
The feet are way too small
for the body.

37:38.522 --> 37:41.292
And I can't get past
the positioning

37:41.359 --> 37:43.394
of her butt and her legs.

37:43.461 --> 37:44.729
The way that pinup is sitting

37:44.795 --> 37:46.230
would never happen
in real life.

37:46.297 --> 37:48.599
- I think you can get away
with it sometimes if you do

37:48.666 --> 37:50.601
exaggerate it and go more
new school and cartoony,

37:50.668 --> 37:52.670
so maybe he should've played it
up a little bit more

37:52.737 --> 37:54.939
if he was gonna make
it a little wonkier.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.040
- Clearly, we're at odds.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.274
And you know--
- Right.

37:57.341 --> 37:58.709
We've got to come
to a decision here.

37:58.776 --> 37:59.877
Let's figure it out.
- Let's figure it out.
