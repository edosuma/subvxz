NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.628 --> 00:04.629
I want you to pull him up.

00:04.713 --> 00:07.924
Did you ever do an autopsy
on a three-week-old stiff?

00:08.008 --> 00:10.593
-They took the governor?
-Not the governor, Ray. Lamont.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.554
Somebody took the governor's wife's dog?

00:12.637 --> 00:14.597
Mick, I want to be your snitch.

00:15.390 --> 00:19.477
To the prettiest lady that ever graced
this sorry side of the tracks.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.357
-Look, you're his girl.
-What if I wasn't?

00:24.441 --> 00:26.651
-Have you ever actually seen him, Renko?
-Who?

00:26.735 --> 00:28.486
You know, the weirdo
down in the sewer system.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.571
You mean the Phantom?

00:29.654 --> 00:32.073
NARRATOR<i>: And now,</i>
<i>tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:33.408 --> 00:36.036
-(screams) Hey! Hey, help me!
-(man growling)

00:36.119 --> 00:38.038
This man is not 47.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.289
Casteneda.

00:39.372 --> 00:42.208
Come on, Wally! This guy's in his 70s.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.544
-I'm so frightened.
-What's wrong?

00:44.627 --> 00:46.379
I'm so afraid!

00:46.463 --> 00:48.339
I don't think we should see
each other anymore.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.257
Is that right?

00:49.340 --> 00:52.385
Will you marry me, Grace?

00:52.469 --> 00:53.887
Oh, Phil.

00:56.639 --> 00:59.100
ESTERHAUS: Item seven.
You've all seen the pictures.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.062
Three bodies burned to a crisp.

01:02.854 --> 01:05.106
Each shot behind the ear for good measure.

01:06.107 --> 01:09.486
A portion of the vehicle
which, uh, survives the barbecue,

01:09.569 --> 01:12.530
identifies the victims as Peruvian.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.658
Circumstance and methodology
of the deceased suggest

01:15.742 --> 01:17.869
probable involvement in the drug trade.

01:18.536 --> 01:20.705
Experience teaches
that these airport episodes

01:20.789 --> 01:22.207
often repercuss on the Hill,

01:22.290 --> 01:25.376
particularly on that section
known as Little Lima.

01:25.877 --> 01:29.589
Item eight. You're reminded, uh,

01:30.006 --> 01:33.885
as if reminders are necessary,
that the MCB continues current

01:33.968 --> 01:37.764
on the governor's wife's
beloved Lhasa Apso, Lamont.

01:37.847 --> 01:40.350
-(laughter)
-(hooting)

01:40.433 --> 01:43.103
The subject is male, sand-colored coat.

01:43.186 --> 01:47.982
Distinguishings are bulging brown eyes
and a blue bow in the forelock.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.860
(laughing)

01:50.944 --> 01:53.113
People, the more timely
this canine's recovery,

01:53.196 --> 01:55.490
the more expeditious
will be this precinct's

01:55.573 --> 01:58.576
return to appropriate police pursuits.

01:58.993 --> 02:01.996
A personal plea from your sergeant.

02:02.247 --> 02:05.792
Please, please. Let's find the damn dog.

02:05.875 --> 02:09.462
(laughter)

02:09.546 --> 02:12.882
Item nine. In view of seasonal
and flu-related absences,

02:12.966 --> 02:15.176
temporary reassignments are as follows:

02:15.677 --> 02:18.304
Crawford and Nicholas,
Hernandez and Wykopf,

02:18.847 --> 02:20.598
Mersky and Deutsch.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.144
On a more somber note.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.020
Item 11.

02:27.188 --> 02:30.525
Night duty Sergeant Devane
records at 2300 hours

02:30.608 --> 02:33.444
an attack on foot patrolman Fred Weiss.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.282
Officer sustained a flesh wound
to the right ankle,

02:37.824 --> 02:39.784
requiring eleven stitches.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.871
A regiment of tetanus injections
has been initiated.

02:43.538 --> 02:48.001
Suspected perpetrator, the Hill Phantom.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.961
-Uh-oh.
-Ooh!

02:50.044 --> 02:52.255
It's clear we're witnessing
one of those periods

02:52.338 --> 02:56.843
of increased activity characteristic
of this unfortunate individual's

02:57.177 --> 03:00.138
haunted subterranean existence.

03:00.889 --> 03:04.392
As we roll, therefore, it behooves us

03:04.851 --> 03:07.770
not only to keep our heads up
as appropriate

03:08.730 --> 03:12.192
but when we pass
those storm drains and sewers

03:12.775 --> 03:15.778
which are the intersection of this poor
creature's world with our own,

03:16.613 --> 03:19.532
we'd best keep our eyes down as well.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.493
All right. That's it. Let's roll.

03:22.577 --> 03:26.122
And let's be very careful out there.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.750
Oh-- Belker.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.003
Will you step to the podium for a second?

03:32.670 --> 03:33.963
(indistinct chattering)

03:37.675 --> 03:40.303
Would you do me a monumental favor, Mick?

03:40.678 --> 03:41.554
Sure.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.475
-You know where Katzenbach Jewelers is?
-Yeah.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.560
Could you pick something up for me?

03:47.644 --> 03:49.729
I'm chained to the desk
with this dog business.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.440
I got a couple reports.
How 'bout after lunch, okay?

03:52.523 --> 03:53.775
Oh, sure. Perfect.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.156
What the hell is it, the Hope Diamond?

04:00.448 --> 04:02.867
-(laughing)
-You must have two weeks' pay in here.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.036
-Keep a secret?
-Yeah.

04:05.995 --> 04:07.997
It's an engagement ring.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.918
I'm poppin' the question tonight
to Grace Gardner.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.379
Oh, Sarge! (chuckles)

04:15.171 --> 04:16.047
Oh!

04:16.798 --> 04:18.299
(laughs)

04:18.591 --> 04:21.219
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:21.302 --> 04:22.929
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:23.012 --> 04:26.808
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:26.891 --> 04:28.559
(sirens wailing)

04:34.023 --> 04:37.944
(theme music playing)

05:51.476 --> 05:53.519
Yes. I'll give him the message directly.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.438
-Yes?
-Excuse me. Yes, um,

05:55.521 --> 05:58.316
would you know where I might find
Officer Renko, please?

05:58.399 --> 06:01.069
Oh. Yes, he's just around the corner
to the left.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.195
Thank you.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.946
-Morning, Phil.
-Oh. Morning, Francis.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.615
Oh, Francis, that was
the coroner's office.

06:05.698 --> 06:09.535
They just exhumed the Castaneda body.
Autopsy's at 9:15.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.913
-Thanks.
-Oh, uh, Francis, uh...

06:13.289 --> 06:14.248
(chuckles)

06:15.416 --> 06:18.294
-You keep a secret?
-Sure.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.048
I'm asking for Grace's hand tonight.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.051
Oh, Phil, that's wonderful news.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.387
Mum's the word until I get an acceptance.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.643
You upset about something
when you left the party?

06:33.726 --> 06:34.644
No.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.479
-How was Wilt?
-Doug.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.065
-Did you have a good time?
-Yeah. He's a nice kid.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.067
Where'd you meet him,
at a day care center?

06:41.234 --> 06:44.112
Someday I should figure out
how much time I spend waiting for Renko

06:44.195 --> 06:46.155
by this bench. (chuckles)

06:47.698 --> 06:51.411
-Uh, he'll be right out.
-Thanks. (clears throat)

06:52.036 --> 06:53.329
Oh, here comes the man.

06:53.621 --> 06:56.457
Hi there, sweetmeat. What're you doing
up in these mean streets?

06:56.541 --> 07:00.420
-Good morning.
-Um, I'll just wait for you outside. Bye.

07:00.962 --> 07:01.838
Good morning.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.466
I-I need to talk to you
for a couple of minutes, please.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.636
Sure.

07:22.817 --> 07:23.860
What can I do for you?

07:32.118 --> 07:35.163
Well, there's really no easy way
to say this.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.624
I don't think we should see
each other anymore.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.420
-Is that right?
-Yes, it is.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.258
Would you mind telling me why?

07:49.677 --> 07:50.720
Does it really make any difference?

07:50.803 --> 07:53.389
Yeah, it does. It does.
I mean, I-I thought...

07:54.682 --> 07:57.351
We did have that little set-to
at that, uh, gallery opening

07:57.435 --> 07:58.895
with your high-and-mighty friends, but--

08:00.730 --> 08:02.231
Yeah, it does make a difference. Tell me.

08:05.985 --> 08:06.986
We're just too different. We--

08:07.069 --> 08:08.279
Wait a minute. We're not too different

08:08.362 --> 08:10.198
two or three times a week
for the last two months.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.285
-There's a lot of things I could say but--
-Say 'em.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.078
-What's the point?
-Say 'em.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.413
What's the point?

08:23.252 --> 08:25.296
I don't like your bullying.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.632
I don't like your reverse snobbery.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.800
-Bullying.
-Yeah. Forcing me to do things,

08:29.884 --> 08:31.802
like making me take a drink
that I don't want to drink.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.680
-Having a good time at a party.
-Just so I can be one of the guys?

08:34.764 --> 08:38.351
Your attitude about women,
the way you treat me like an object

08:38.434 --> 08:39.727
and your whole stupid idea

08:39.810 --> 08:41.521
-that the only real people...
-Now, we're getting there?

08:41.604 --> 08:42.563
-...are people who sweat for a living!
-Now, we're getting there?

08:42.647 --> 08:43.856
You don't have the slightest idea

08:43.940 --> 08:45.775
-what I think about women!
-You don't tell me what I do or don't!

08:52.240 --> 08:53.157
What are we doing?

08:55.076 --> 08:55.993
Andrew.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.499
I liked you. I-I still like you a lot. I--

09:04.001 --> 09:06.629
There's no reason to pretend
that we had more than we had.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.175
There's no point making this
more difficult than it already is.

09:13.678 --> 09:14.512
Right.

09:19.183 --> 09:20.101
You're right.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.979
No sweat. No pain.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.775
Just chic, polite.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.696
-I'm sorry.
-You get out.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.559
-COFFEY: I need a pen.
-Hello.

10:03.019 --> 10:03.894
How you doing?

10:06.439 --> 10:09.984
Um, look, I'm sorry about last night. I--

10:10.067 --> 10:11.652
Don't-- Don't worry about it.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.905
I just talked to Andrew.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.617
We're not going to be
seeing each other anymore.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.080
So, um, if you want, we...

10:24.123 --> 10:25.625
We can get together some time.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.170
Teresa, that's not a good idea right now.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.425
Look, uh, I got to go.

10:36.510 --> 10:37.386
Can I call you?

10:39.221 --> 10:40.056
I don't know.

10:42.933 --> 10:43.851
I'll see you, okay?

11:02.620 --> 11:05.164
What are you doing here?
Didn't I tell you never to come up here--

11:08.167 --> 11:10.086
-What's wrong?
-Mick.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.547
I'm so frightened.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.385
I'm so afraid!

11:19.220 --> 11:20.971
He killed those Peruvians!

11:21.055 --> 11:22.181
Oh, my God, Mick!

11:22.264 --> 11:23.766
-He was covered in blood. (crying)
-Calm down.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.602
-Just tell me what happened.
-He came home around 4:30.

11:26.769 --> 11:27.978
-That's your boyfriend.
-Jose.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.855
The one that bailed you out
when I first busted you?

11:29.939 --> 11:31.482
No. That was Ramon.

11:31.565 --> 11:34.235
I watched him burn his clothes,
wash the blood off.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.279
-My God, he was soaked in blood!
-Take it easy.

11:37.363 --> 11:41.701
And then when I saw those pictures,
the bodies in the car, Mick-- Oh!

11:42.827 --> 11:45.538
The boyfriend's been setting up the deal
for two months.

11:45.621 --> 11:46.831
Now he loses his bankroll,

11:46.914 --> 11:49.625
so he decides to take
the Peruvian suppliers.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.794
He meets 'em at the airport
and blows 'em away.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.880
I'd say our 50 dollars yesterday
was well spent.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.759
Captain, I promised Eddie
he wouldn't have to testify.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.219
He's terrified of that lover.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.596
He'd be next to useless
on the witness stand anyway.

12:03.848 --> 12:04.974
Let's have him go over the mug books,

12:05.057 --> 12:07.810
see if he can identify anybody
who's done business with the boyfriend.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.562
We'll try to bust him and roll him over.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.898
-Autopsy, Frank.
-Keep Ray posted.

12:15.901 --> 12:16.902
-(telephone ringing)
-(indistinct chattering)

12:16.986 --> 12:18.112
Dog hotline.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.783
Mm-hmm. When was this?

12:24.618 --> 12:26.370
Yeah. Yeah.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.538
Who am I speaking to?

12:30.166 --> 12:32.877
Yes, Mr. Caldwell. One thousand dollars.

12:36.130 --> 12:39.550
No, uh-- That's very scrupulous of you.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.304
After the recovery'd be fine.
Let me just get this one more time.

12:43.387 --> 12:47.308
It's 466 Carmine, apartment 2A, right?

12:48.684 --> 12:49.852
Thank you much, Mr. Caldwell.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.353
-Doggie hotline.
-Any luck, Henry?

12:52.062 --> 12:53.981
Lhasa Apso in abandoned apartment.

12:54.064 --> 12:54.899
Guy doesn't want to be paid

12:54.982 --> 12:57.109
until after the governor's wife
identifies the dog.

12:57.735 --> 13:01.071
-Great. Howard.
-Uh...

13:01.155 --> 13:06.952
This is a white male, 5'7,
158 pounds, 47 years old.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.331
Exhumed 22 days after... (exhales)

13:12.583 --> 13:13.417
interment.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.216
Superficial tissue.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.134
Unremarkable.

13:23.636 --> 13:28.224
Exhibits first stage of decomposition
consistent with introduction

13:28.808 --> 13:31.644
preservation... fluid.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.437
Wally.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.398
Castaneda was 47 years old.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.401
-NYDORF: Isn't that what we've got?
-Yes, sir.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.529
This man is not 47.

13:44.657 --> 13:48.369
Well, see, Frank, uh,
he's been underground three weeks--

13:48.452 --> 13:51.205
Come on, Wally! This guy's in his 70s.

13:56.794 --> 13:57.837
Check the toe tag.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.218
Castaneda. They dug him up this morning.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.555
Some kind of screw-up!

14:07.638 --> 14:09.098
FURILLO: What in the hell's going on here?

14:11.392 --> 14:14.270
Frank. Frank,
I'll-I'll get the right body for you.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.857
Seventy-two hour rule, Coroner Nydorf,

14:18.274 --> 14:20.359
either I charge or we release.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.073
-(heavy breathing)
-(eerie music plays)

14:32.705 --> 14:34.123
Is he dead or what?

14:34.206 --> 14:36.876
Come on, pal. Come on.
No snoozing in a red zone.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.423
-(man growls)
-(screams)

14:42.506 --> 14:43.716
Pete! Pete!

14:43.799 --> 14:46.927
-(screaming)
-(man growling)

14:49.346 --> 14:50.472
Pete!

14:56.520 --> 14:58.856
(pants)

15:03.360 --> 15:06.947
-Officer Tataglia. Is something wrong?
-It was the Phantom.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.241
Grabbed her leg
from a storm drain on Dekker.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.161
-Just about tore it off.
-<i>!Oh, madre mía!</i>

15:12.244 --> 15:14.246
-He got my shoe.
-Shoes?

15:14.330 --> 15:17.041
Ooh. A new and disconcerting twist.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.792
-Oh, the Phantom, huh?
-Yeah, the Phantom.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.754
Uh, I got him a good one with my stick.
Uh, I think I must've hurt him.

15:21.837 --> 15:26.383
Speaking of injuries, Officer Tataglia,
perhaps we should have that ankle x-rayed.

15:26.467 --> 15:30.095
No, no. He didn't even break the skin.
I'm okay. Honest.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.057
Phil, call A.D.A. Bernstein.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.975
Tell him I have to get with him
this afternoon.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.644
Anything wrong with the autopsy?

15:36.727 --> 15:39.355
Other than a no-show by the body,
it was just grand.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.025
-Washington.
-Yo, Mick.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.569
I got a snitch.
Picked these dealers out of the book.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.155
-You, uh, know any of 'em?
<i>-Nada.</i>

15:48.489 --> 15:51.617
-Mm-hmm.
-<i>Nada. Nada.</i>

15:51.700 --> 15:52.868
-Sid.
-Sid.

15:53.869 --> 15:54.828
You tight with this guy?

15:55.204 --> 15:57.790
We were about to bust him
when Myzell went south.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.458
He thinks we're a couple of cupcakes.

15:59.541 --> 16:03.587
Can you set me up a meet today?
I got a hook on those three Peruvians.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.464
Just a phone call away, my man.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.633
-Thank you very much.
-You got it.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.426
-(dog barking, growling)
-Frank.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.762
I don't know if this is the right dog
or the wrong dog.

16:11.845 --> 16:15.182
But it is definitely the last dog
that I am going to recover.

16:15.265 --> 16:17.518
Francis, A.D.A. Bernstein
can see you this afternoon.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.979
But he'd like you to include everyone
on the Edwards case,

16:20.062 --> 16:21.897
Washington, LaRue, Coroner Nydorf.

16:21.981 --> 16:26.694
Oh, yeah. Phil, uh, one second, please.
Could you take our charge here

16:27.361 --> 16:29.279
somewhere where, uh, he can be
reunited with his owner?

16:29.363 --> 16:32.574
Well, of course! Come here, poochie.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.743
-(dog whining)
-That's a good fella.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.044
For the record, Frank,
in my entire career,

16:44.128 --> 16:46.839
I've never suffered
a more humiliating indignity.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.302
Frank, I was urinated on.

16:55.973 --> 16:59.226
Be sure to submit
a dry-cleaning voucher, Howard.

17:01.937 --> 17:04.189
Damn foreign-type dogs.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.526
Give me a shepherd any day.

17:09.653 --> 17:10.529
(door slams)

17:15.284 --> 17:17.244
Yo, Mr. Policeman.

17:18.954 --> 17:24.209
Martinez requesting a viewing
of the alleged Lasso "apsis", Lamont,

17:25.335 --> 17:28.422
which I have a personal knowledge
is a fraud.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.676
-(whining)
-Bogus, Henry.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.137
Fake. Not even close.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.514
What makes you say so, Jesus?

17:38.223 --> 17:40.267
-Trust me, Henry. Trust me.
-(dog whines)

17:40.350 --> 17:41.560
The dog's a hummer.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.981
-(dog growls)
-That is not Lamont.

17:49.526 --> 17:53.572
This is a bitch.
Didn't you even sex the animal?

17:54.156 --> 17:57.910
Did I explore the dog's privates?
No, madam. I denied myself that pleasure.

17:57.993 --> 18:01.789
But I can certainly attest to the fact
that they are in working order.

18:03.290 --> 18:06.085
-I'd like a word with you.
-Of course.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.465
I myself don't know who has the mutt.

18:12.257 --> 18:15.719
I don't have the slightest idea
where the mutt is at.

18:16.887 --> 18:20.307
But I think maybe I know somebody

18:20.641 --> 18:24.436
who knows somebody else
who knows. You know?

18:24.812 --> 18:26.563
Don't push your luck, Jesus.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.398
(speaks Spanish)

18:28.649 --> 18:29.817
Cool it, brother.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.695
I'm just a concerned citizen here.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.864
I could have you arrested as an accessory.

18:36.490 --> 18:40.327
Yeah, maybe.
But I don't think Lamont would like that.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.745
Why don't we hear him out?

18:43.080 --> 18:46.166
Thank you, Frankie.
You're always a gentleman.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.461
Like I said the mutt's available.

18:49.545 --> 18:54.091
But it's gonna require a thousand dollars
for the people he's staying with.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.009
-And what is your cut?
-Me?

18:56.635 --> 18:58.137
Got no cut, bro.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.431
Bottom line, Jesus. Right now.

19:03.350 --> 19:07.437
I got a proposal with the federals
for the Inner City Pilot Program.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.024
We must put a stop to this urban decay.

19:11.608 --> 19:12.901
Right, brother Ray?

19:13.902 --> 19:17.406
We must harness the energy
of the troubled gang youth.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.617
Get 'em off the corner and on the job.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.162
-BERNSTEIN: Captain.
-Speed it up.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.166
The rebop kings in Washington
are always talking about

19:27.249 --> 19:29.001
revenue sharing, right?

19:30.294 --> 19:31.920
Funneling the conscience money

19:32.004 --> 19:34.339
through the state capitols
and all of that.

19:35.465 --> 19:40.387
When Trudy's main squeeze
gets me the grant, she gets Lamont.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.431
That's out-and-out blackmail!

19:42.598 --> 19:45.684
Sounds to me like a good faith
request for a recommendation?

19:46.018 --> 19:48.020
You tell Trudy it's blackmail.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.647
You're just jiving us,
aren't you, wise guy?

19:50.939 --> 19:54.026
You don't know where the dog is.
You're lying like all the others.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.528
Well, I will make sure
that you never, never--

19:56.612 --> 19:58.322
(collar jingles)

20:01.033 --> 20:04.953
-"L-A-M"--
-Let me see that.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.790
I hear these guys
are pretty tough, Furillo.

20:09.499 --> 20:13.587
They wanted to send Lamont's paw
as a token of friendship.

20:16.131 --> 20:20.510
Okay. I'll see the governor gives you
a priority recommendation.

20:20.844 --> 20:21.762
-Hey!
-(taps tables)

20:23.347 --> 20:25.807
Recommendations are for job applicants.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.142
I want a grant.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.355
Otherwise, these guys
are gonna fillet Lamont

20:31.438 --> 20:33.982
and mail him home in an envelope.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.281
When will the dog be returned?

20:46.203 --> 20:47.371
I'll get back to ya.

20:57.172 --> 21:01.343
Hey, we're on, babe. Three o'clock sharp.
Hasen's Restaurant.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.427
Sid likes to sit in the back.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.554
Great. Gives me a chance to run an errand.

21:04.638 --> 21:05.847
-See you there.
-Yeah.

21:09.476 --> 21:12.229
Grace, my sweet, our favorite restaurant,

21:12.312 --> 21:15.524
our favorite wine,
Venus sitting over the water.

21:15.607 --> 21:19.611
I think tonight's gonna be a night
that you and I will long remember.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.032
DAVENPORT:<i> One more shoe, pizza man.</i>

21:25.033 --> 21:26.285
We're due back on the Hill in 15 minutes.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.620
-What are you doing?
-(groans)

21:28.954 --> 21:33.959
Ah. The Furillo diet, plenty of exercise
and no time left for lunch.

21:35.919 --> 21:36.878
(clears throat)

21:39.047 --> 21:42.134
-We can munch on these in the cab.
-Gee, thanks.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.681
(elevator dings)

21:50.058 --> 21:50.934
Frank!

21:52.978 --> 21:55.314
-Fay.
-Um...

21:56.189 --> 22:00.360
-Uh, this is Paul.
-Ah, how are you?

22:01.903 --> 22:03.030
(clears throat) Joyce.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.241
Judge Grogin of Traffic Court.

22:07.576 --> 22:08.910
-Guilty.
-(chuckles)

22:11.038 --> 22:15.792
Well, Paul, we seem to have made
a terrible mistake. Uh...

22:16.376 --> 22:18.795
The Rainbow Room's not on this floor.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.423
-Uh, is it?
-No?

22:21.840 --> 22:22.758
(snickers)

22:23.633 --> 22:25.135
I think you want the 18th.

22:26.386 --> 22:29.264
Oh! (stutters) Well, what floor is this?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.224
-Three.
-(elevator bell dings)

22:33.935 --> 22:35.520
Uh, we--

22:36.229 --> 22:38.398
We--We were just leaving.
Enjoy your lunch.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.778
(snickers) They have very good food here.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.155
-(sniffles) I have a cold.
-We really have to go.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.616
-FURILLO: It's nice meeting you.
-Nice meeting you two, too.

22:50.827 --> 22:51.912
Have a nice lunch.

22:59.002 --> 23:01.421
(Joyce laughing)

23:21.566 --> 23:24.486
-May I help you?
-Yeah. I got a ring to pick up.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.821
-Esterhaus.
-Esterhaus?

23:25.904 --> 23:28.073
I don't believe I know the name.
Do you have a sales slip?

23:28.448 --> 23:29.408
Yes, I do.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.506
Oh, yes. The half-carat Midnight Jubilee.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.966
Just a moment, please.

23:47.884 --> 23:50.262
Uh, no smoking here.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.861
I believe there's a balance remaining
of 400 dollars.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.237
Yeah. I got it right here.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.281
(man moaning, grunting)

24:13.243 --> 24:15.412
You want to step back, please?
Come on, move back.

24:15.495 --> 24:18.039
(man continues thrashing)

24:22.836 --> 24:25.630
-(indistinct chattering)
-(breathing heavily)

24:30.594 --> 24:32.721
I'm-I'm... I'm all right.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.599
-You sure?
-Yeah, I'm positive. I'm-I'm fine.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.977
-I'm fine. (breathing heavily)
-(grunts)

24:42.230 --> 24:43.690
I just need some fresh air.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.109
-I'm fine. Thank you.
-You sure you're all right?

24:46.193 --> 24:47.611
-I'm fine.
-Okay.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.779
I'm sorry. Thank you.

24:51.406 --> 24:52.240
(sighs) Well.

24:54.117 --> 24:55.744
Hey, you-- hold it!

24:56.328 --> 24:57.871
-Move!
-WOMAN: Oh!

25:00.123 --> 25:01.583
Police! Freeze!

25:07.172 --> 25:10.091
Where's the ring, dirt bag? (growling)

25:10.175 --> 25:12.177
I want that ring!

25:14.346 --> 25:16.973
Sit down, armpit,
or I'll eat your lungs for lunch.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.020
Who's the suspect, Mick?

25:22.854 --> 25:23.813
Hi, Sarge.

25:25.607 --> 25:29.528
I caught him taking a five-finger discount
down at Katzenbach's jewelry store.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.780
No kidding. Right when you were
down there picking up the ring?

25:31.863 --> 25:33.782
(laughs) Yeah. Him and another guy.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.620
-Well, where's the other one?
-Well, he kind of got away.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.457
I got to talk to you
about something, Sarge.

25:43.083 --> 25:43.917
What'd they get?

25:44.000 --> 25:48.547
A bunch of bracelets,
earrings, watches, rings.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.674
-A lot of rings.
-Rings?

25:51.258 --> 25:53.843
Yeah, well, I mean, sure. Rings. Kind of.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.181
That's what I got to
talk to you about, Sarge.

25:59.182 --> 26:02.269
-Where's my ring?
-I think the other guy got it.

26:04.854 --> 26:05.939
Excuse me, Mick.

26:09.734 --> 26:14.114
Young man, I intend to interrogate you
personally forthwith.

26:14.197 --> 26:16.199
I don't say nothin'
without my attorney, man.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.659
Maybe I ought to stick with you
on this, Sarge.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.661
I got Constitutional rights.

26:19.744 --> 26:22.956
Oh, Miss Davenport.
A moment of your time, please.

26:28.044 --> 26:28.920
(wood creaks)

26:29.004 --> 26:32.549
Mr. Crane, concerning the ring
in question.

26:33.216 --> 26:35.760
I believe you might find it advisable

26:36.344 --> 26:39.889
from a negotiating point of view,
as it were...

26:40.390 --> 26:44.394
You're coming dangerously close
to unconstitutional coercion, Sergeant.

26:46.771 --> 26:49.733
Miss Davenport.
It was his engagement ring.

26:49.816 --> 26:52.110
He was gonna ask Grace Gardner
to marry him tonight.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.363
(sighs)

26:55.447 --> 26:58.867
Mr. Crane, please comprehend
that I don't give a damn

26:58.950 --> 27:01.578
whether you ultimately receive
a jail term or not.

27:03.413 --> 27:06.708
-I've got a phone call to make.
-Hey, wait a minute. You ain't leaving!

27:06.791 --> 27:10.170
Unless you feel like giving over the name
of your running mate,

27:10.253 --> 27:12.464
you insidious little termite,

27:12.547 --> 27:15.884
(hiss) I may be forced to do something

27:16.134 --> 27:19.387
that I haven't done in many years.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.931
Herman Fowler. 337 Maplecrest.

27:22.015 --> 27:25.268
-What's that name again?
-Herman Fowler. 337 Maplecrest.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.687
Fourth floor. Room 49.
Right next to the trash chute.

27:28.688 --> 27:33.068
Mick. I believe Coffey and Bates
are available for an arrest.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.822
Because I just don't feel right
about it, that's why.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.577
Tonight? (chuckles) No way. Uh-uh.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.415
Look, I'm sorry. I can't.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.541
-Yo, Joseph.
-(clears throat)

27:48.625 --> 27:51.294
We got a felony trash pickup
on Maplecrest.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.547
-Sarge says pronto.
-One second.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.718
Look, I got to go.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.098
I'll-I'll get back to you later,
okay? Right.

28:07.977 --> 28:09.479
Sorry I'm late, guys.

28:10.480 --> 28:14.442
But, uh, we have a bit of a problem.

28:14.734 --> 28:17.821
What kind of problem, Wally?
Did you find Castaneda's body?

28:19.531 --> 28:23.159
No. Castaneda's body is N.R.,

28:23.952 --> 28:27.330
-non-retrievable.
-What do you mean, non-retrievable?

28:29.582 --> 28:33.920
Look, I'm really very
sorry about this, guys, but, uh...

28:34.963 --> 28:39.008
Frank, you know that wrong stiff
we had on the slab this morning?

28:39.801 --> 28:43.054
Well, it seems that he was a John Doe

28:43.138 --> 28:47.267
we scraped up off the streets in skid row
the same day Castaneda died.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.770
Then the way I figure it,

28:51.896 --> 28:55.233
we got the toe tags mixed up
on the two guys by mistake.

28:56.776 --> 29:00.822
Frank, I'm embarrassed about this,
but it happens.

29:01.322 --> 29:02.449
Course, the, uh...

29:04.033 --> 29:06.369
upshot of it is that, uh...

29:07.996 --> 29:11.583
Well, look, Frank, we would never cremate
a homicide, but, uh...

29:12.792 --> 29:14.627
we do cremate bums.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.840
-So--
-Castaneda was cremated?

29:21.634 --> 29:23.178
I'm afraid you're out one victim.

29:23.261 --> 29:26.556
-Oh, man!
-I don't believe this!

29:27.348 --> 29:29.768
We put in over a hundred hours
building the case,

29:29.851 --> 29:33.229
-you lame, incompetent--
-J.D. Neal.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.607
Don't you have some business
to attend to outside?

29:36.107 --> 29:37.233
-Right.
-Yeah. Sure.

29:40.570 --> 29:41.946
Just for the record, Wally,

29:42.030 --> 29:45.033
I'd have to agree with LaRue's evaluation
of your abilities.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.368
Now you just stow it, Frank!

29:47.452 --> 29:49.496
I'm not one of your departmental stooges
around here!

29:49.579 --> 29:51.831
Wally, Wally, Frank, please.

29:52.290 --> 29:55.126
Let's try to figure a way
to deal with this mess.

29:58.546 --> 29:59.589
(sighs)

29:59.672 --> 30:02.509
FURILLO: No cause of death.
No murder case.

30:02.675 --> 30:04.219
That's how I've always understood the law.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.429
Well, technically, yes.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.598
I see no reason to continue this meeting.

30:08.681 --> 30:12.227
Unless it's to discuss
the immediate release of our suspect.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.355
Look, Frank.

30:20.527 --> 30:23.696
I'm as sorry about this
as anybody in this room.

30:24.948 --> 30:30.036
But, Frank,
I've gone over the crime lab photos,

30:30.870 --> 30:32.205
and believe me,

30:32.288 --> 30:35.917
there is nothing mysterious
about how Castaneda died.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.711
Hell, I could describe
the cause of death in my sleep!

30:38.795 --> 30:41.297
Come on, Wally.
That's not nearly good enough.

30:41.548 --> 30:42.882
I submit a report.

30:42.966 --> 30:45.510
I talk a couple minutes
on tracheal blockage.

30:45.593 --> 30:47.095
And then the defense attorney

30:47.178 --> 30:50.890
starts a line-by-line cross-examination
of the autopsy report...

30:50.974 --> 30:53.935
Wait a minute, Frank. Let's not be hasty.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.522
You would be amazed
how informal these prelims can get

30:57.605 --> 30:59.023
with regard to cause of death.

30:59.983 --> 31:03.403
We get past the hearing,
maybe we can get a plea out of Edwards.

31:03.486 --> 31:04.946
And what if he blows it up there?

31:05.780 --> 31:09.868
(sighs) Look, Frank, it's a bad situation,
but Wally is making some sense.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.828
Let me talk this out with the D.A.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.496
I'll get back to both of you.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.332
(door opens)

31:17.292 --> 31:20.044
No, it's good to meet you, Lee.
It's a real pleasure.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.005
-No, no. It's my pleasure.
-Oh.

31:22.088 --> 31:25.383
Look, you guys want anything
to eat here, chips or hot stuff?

31:25.466 --> 31:27.093
-Yeah, thanks. No.
-Want to try the wine?

31:27.176 --> 31:28.845
-Oh, that great wine?
-I'd love to.

31:28.928 --> 31:31.180
Hey, I'm on the wagon. Only dope.

31:31.264 --> 31:34.434
(laughing)

31:34.517 --> 31:36.936
So, you are Teddy and Steve's<i> amigo.</i>

31:37.020 --> 31:38.354
Oh, yeah. For a long time.

31:38.438 --> 31:39.689
Well, they're good people.

31:40.273 --> 31:42.483
Even if they are too busy
for their Uncle Sid here.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.277
-Yeah.
-Hey, come on, you bums.

31:44.360 --> 31:47.071
I haven't heard squat one from you
in two weeks. Hey!

31:47.155 --> 31:49.866
-Hey, we went skiing, baby.
-Yeah, down in Dade County.

31:49.949 --> 31:52.243
(laughing)

31:52.327 --> 31:54.662
Hey, I tell you what. The powder was deep.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.332
Listen, I got to tell you, Lee.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.917
-Did you tell him the story--
-What?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.418
Let-let me tell the story.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.962
I felt terrible with these two.
(clears throat)

32:03.963 --> 32:08.384
I'm movin' these two a little soda,
and, uh, just a couple pounds,

32:08.468 --> 32:11.012
and another guy who I'm also movin'

32:11.554 --> 32:13.598
-turns out to be the heat.
-No.

32:13.848 --> 32:15.558
-So, boom!
-No.

32:16.559 --> 32:19.187
-Somebody kills him.
-(clicks tongue)

32:19.270 --> 32:22.231
Now, evidently, these two guys
got a little scared,

32:22.315 --> 32:25.902
which I don't blame them,
because the next day they call me,

32:26.861 --> 32:29.489
-and they're in Atlantic City.
-(laughter)

32:29.572 --> 32:31.616
That's the only place
he could pass for Italian.

32:32.909 --> 32:37.538
-Hey... Hey, watch it, man.
-And this guy. This guy's too much.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.499
He's always making jokes. Man, I love him.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.459
-(chuckles)
-And you. You.

32:41.542 --> 32:42.835
-Come here. come on.
-Try it.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.337
-You want one on there?
-Try it.

32:45.046 --> 32:49.008
I wouldn't do it. Last time I saw you,
you had a collar like the Budweiser horse.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.386
I got it from the horse.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.305
It was a little insurance gift.
Did you make out on that?

32:54.389 --> 32:55.431
Pocket change. You know.

32:55.515 --> 32:59.435
-Hey. So we all right here or what?
-Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, sure.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.271
But, listen. When are we
gonna do a little business?

33:02.355 --> 33:04.023
Uh, we a little short right now, babe.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.984
We've just been moving some copper wire.

33:06.067 --> 33:08.027
Soon as we get off it,
we're back in action, okay?

33:08.111 --> 33:11.197
-Okay.
-But don't forget your uncle.

33:11.656 --> 33:12.782
Hey, never.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.243
I also want to tighten you up
for this introduction here.

33:15.326 --> 33:16.619
-Forget it.
-No. I'm gonna do it.

33:16.703 --> 33:17.954
Hey, not necessary.

33:20.623 --> 33:21.582
Take care, huh?

33:22.041 --> 33:23.960
-WASHINGTON: Easy.
-All right. Hang loose.

33:24.585 --> 33:25.503
Later.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.341
So.

33:31.426 --> 33:35.263
So, I, uh, I told the fellas
I was lookin' for a little stuff.

33:35.346 --> 33:37.056
I'm exclusively soda, Lee.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.517
-Can I call you Lee?
-Absolutely.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.728
Okay. I'm soda. (sniffing)

33:42.186 --> 33:45.148
-Exclusively.
-Well, good, 'cause that's my action too.

33:46.566 --> 33:49.110
Now, um, how much weight
were you lookin' for?

33:49.944 --> 33:52.321
-I'm lookin' to do...
-Kilos?

33:52.405 --> 33:54.282
-(laughs) Pounds.

33:56.034 --> 33:59.328
Uh, there's no problem with if-come,
am I right, Lee? Because, I mean--

33:59.412 --> 34:00.705
Cash on delivery.

34:01.122 --> 34:04.917
'Cause we're taking about
100 percent Peruvian soda.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.544
Nobody has stepped on this.

34:07.628 --> 34:10.381
-I'm--I'm gettin' 30,000 dollars per unit.
-Mm!

34:10.673 --> 34:11.799
When can we do this?

34:14.385 --> 34:15.511
Well, I got to tell ya.

34:15.595 --> 34:18.681
This is such a coincidence,
because I happen to be in a position.

34:20.349 --> 34:21.809
How's tomorrow look for you?

34:22.894 --> 34:24.687
Tomorrow couldn't be better for me.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.023
You're a citizen, Lee.

34:28.316 --> 34:30.109
You're just who Steve and Teddy'd
bring along.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.569
Thank you very much.

34:32.028 --> 34:33.196
Sure you won't try the wine?

34:33.821 --> 34:35.656
-Yeah. I'll have a little.
-Good.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.493
'Cause I think you're gonna like it.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.666
I think they get it in California.

34:46.334 --> 34:49.879
He got my purse! He grabbed it!

34:49.962 --> 34:51.422
He got my purse!

34:52.924 --> 34:55.968
-Who took your purse?
-That creep! He ran in the sewer!

34:56.052 --> 34:58.137
Okay, okay. Calm down.
Can you give us a description?

34:58.221 --> 34:59.764
-Description?
-Yeah.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.516
Sugar, he looked like something

35:01.599 --> 35:04.644
that somebody left in their
refrigerator for six months!

35:04.727 --> 35:07.105
-What's the trouble here?
-It's the Phantom.

35:08.272 --> 35:11.150
Well, are you gonna go down there
and get my purse back or what?

35:22.370 --> 35:23.204
CRAWFORD: Throw down the light.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.637
(indistinct chattering)

35:46.352 --> 35:48.020
They're inside, babe. (laughs)

35:48.104 --> 35:50.148
Hey, listen.
Don't spring it too soon, okay?

35:50.231 --> 35:52.483
Hey, what, and spoil my fun?

35:52.567 --> 35:55.695
I own these four bozos
for the rest of the afternoon.

35:57.822 --> 36:01.492
CRAWFORD: Listen, guys.
If he's lived down here for years,

36:01.993 --> 36:03.995
he must know every inch of this place.

36:04.078 --> 36:05.454
DORSEY: Nice thought.

36:05.538 --> 36:06.998
CRAWFORD:
Maybe we ought to wait for backup.

36:07.081 --> 36:08.708
TATAGLIA: And say what when they show up,

36:08.791 --> 36:12.170
we were too scared of the dark
to go in by ourselves? Come on.

36:12.253 --> 36:14.547
(dripping water echoes)

36:24.640 --> 36:26.225
-What are you doing?
-(all gasping)

36:26.309 --> 36:27.685
I don't know.
I think I tripped on something.

36:30.062 --> 36:32.565
It's mine. Will you look at that?

36:33.608 --> 36:36.903
Oh. That creep must have chewed it.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.699
-(LaRue grunting)
-What was that?

36:46.162 --> 36:49.457
-Down there.
-(grunting continues)

36:58.090 --> 37:00.384
(growling, screaming)

37:00.468 --> 37:03.596
(distorted growling)

37:09.977 --> 37:12.063
(voice distorting) Man, no, no!

37:12.146 --> 37:13.981
(gunshot)

37:21.781 --> 37:24.242
Hello, Teresa? Yeah, this is Andy.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.577
Listen, I'm sorry about this morning.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.621
Listen, I got to see you tonight.
It's real important.

37:30.456 --> 37:32.208
There's a lot of things
I got to talk to you about.

37:35.419 --> 37:36.337
Oh, is that so?

37:37.672 --> 37:39.590
You sure don't waste any time,
do you, girl?

37:41.467 --> 37:45.304
All of a sudden,
Art Delgado comes out of the sewer rafter.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.473
(laughing)

37:47.556 --> 37:49.016
No, no, no. Wait, wait.

37:49.100 --> 37:52.103
He's got a bullhorn
full of compressed air,

37:52.186 --> 37:55.273
-two dead rats hanging from his--
-(laughter)

37:55.356 --> 37:58.150
Two dead rats hanging from his ears.

37:58.234 --> 38:00.653
(laughter)

38:00.736 --> 38:03.114
Okay? I'm terrified!

38:04.031 --> 38:05.741
But I got the joke.

38:06.450 --> 38:07.827
I laughed.

38:08.411 --> 38:12.873
I didn't pull my service revolver
and try to blow his head off.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.543
-(clears throat)
-You know? What?

38:16.669 --> 38:19.088
Oh. (chuckles) Hi, sharpshot.

38:33.477 --> 38:34.687
Pretty rough day today, huh?

38:35.855 --> 38:39.150
You jiving me? Almost killed your partner.

38:40.776 --> 38:41.736
You want to talk it out?

38:42.528 --> 38:45.489
I went crazy. I choked.

38:46.365 --> 38:48.159
I don't even remember pulling my gun.

38:49.201 --> 38:51.579
And now you figure you don't have
what it takes to be a cop. Mm?

38:52.079 --> 38:55.041
Maybe it's lucky I found out now.
Saves me a lot of time.

38:55.958 --> 38:56.834
Maybe.

38:57.585 --> 39:00.713
-I ought to quit. I'm a coward.
-Good idea.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.631
-Hey.
-What?

39:02.715 --> 39:05.176
Maybe you ought to lighten up
on the guy, Mr. Kelp Suit.

39:05.259 --> 39:06.302
Oh, yeah. That's right. Yeah.

39:06.385 --> 39:09.472
I'll bet you're just dyin'
to go ride with him again tomorrow.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.724
That's none of your business.

39:14.977 --> 39:16.187
Ya got hair, kid.

39:17.563 --> 39:18.481
You're all right.

39:30.284 --> 39:32.953
Well, it must have been something
that got you through the academy.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.873
Must have been something
that made you want to be a cop.

39:36.374 --> 39:40.127
-Would you believe dreams of a desk job?
-Mm-hmm. No, I don't.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.965
It's happened, even to a veteran cop.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.385
Things get confused.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.848
-He fires his gun at an innocent person--
-I don't want to talk about it anymore.

39:54.642 --> 39:55.976
(exhales)

39:56.060 --> 39:56.977
Two months ago,

39:58.813 --> 40:01.899
-I shot and killed an innocent man.
-You did?

40:03.567 --> 40:05.569
Two guys coming out
of a liquor store holdup.

40:06.987 --> 40:08.489
One pointed a shotgun at me.

40:09.657 --> 40:10.533
I fired.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.161
He owned the store.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.080
Oh, man.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.750
Lot of sleepless nights
between then and now.

40:19.834 --> 40:20.960
Lot of questions.

40:22.044 --> 40:25.256
All of us on the job,
we all live with your kind of doubts.

40:26.006 --> 40:27.633
Five days out of every seven.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.761
Questions that there
just aren't any answers to.

40:32.263 --> 40:35.391
Look, Nate, I'm not saying
that you're meant to be a cop,

40:36.142 --> 40:37.852
but if you decide that's what
you want to do,

40:38.519 --> 40:40.396
then you better learn
to live with 'em too, man.

40:42.982 --> 40:45.693
Something-- Something
to think about anyway, okay?

40:46.360 --> 40:47.236
Okay.

40:58.747 --> 40:59.874
Mick?

41:01.792 --> 41:03.627
-What?
-I can't do it.

41:04.336 --> 41:06.755
-Do what?
-Stay with Jose tonight.

41:07.381 --> 41:09.425
I'm afraid of him. Of what he did.

41:10.176 --> 41:13.929
Every time I close my eyes,
I see those charred Peruvians.

41:14.889 --> 41:17.641
-It's horrible. I can't.
-So don't.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.728
Just whatever you do, make sure he thinks

41:20.811 --> 41:22.563
it's an ordinary night, will you, please?

41:25.691 --> 41:27.026
Go on. Scram. Beat it.

41:30.237 --> 41:31.405
I have no place to go.

41:33.115 --> 41:36.243
I was wondering if maybe, uh,
I could stay with you.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.161
Are you nuts?

41:39.955 --> 41:43.250
(chuckles) You and me, in together?
Absolutely not.

41:50.674 --> 41:51.592
Wait a minute.

41:58.015 --> 41:59.350
Go get yourself a room.

42:08.609 --> 42:09.443
Come here.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.324
Sleep on the sofa.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.827
Oh, Mick. You're wonderful.

42:19.495 --> 42:21.497
I'll make you a breakfast fit for a king.

42:21.580 --> 42:23.749
You make me breakfast,
I'll ram it down your throat.

42:23.832 --> 42:25.167
Do you understand that?

42:32.675 --> 42:33.759
You're such a treasure.

42:51.527 --> 42:53.153
(exhales) Phil.

42:54.947 --> 42:56.073
Oh, Grace!

42:58.534 --> 43:00.077
My God. Aren't you early?

43:01.870 --> 43:03.581
Well, you said six o'clock sharp.

43:04.290 --> 43:07.084
You were quite adamant
on that point, as I recall.

43:07.876 --> 43:09.420
Oh. (chuckles)

43:09.503 --> 43:10.838
You sounded so mysterious.

43:10.921 --> 43:12.923
Do you have something special
in mind for this evening?

43:13.007 --> 43:14.967
Oh, no, no, no. Not really.

43:15.634 --> 43:16.844
Oh, well. Yes.

43:17.469 --> 43:19.305
There was gonna be something special,

43:19.388 --> 43:23.142
but, uh, if you have another plan
in mind...

43:25.978 --> 43:27.146
(giggles)

43:29.356 --> 43:30.441
Anything, darling.

43:32.359 --> 43:34.153
Just as long as it's with you.

43:34.820 --> 43:37.114
-Oh, my God.
-Ah.

43:37.197 --> 43:38.782
I don't deserve you, Grace.

43:39.491 --> 43:41.243
-(door closes)
-(footsteps approaching)

43:43.537 --> 43:47.625
-Sarge. Here's your ring.
-Oh. Thanks, Joseph.

43:48.917 --> 43:49.752
(sighs) Oh!

43:51.420 --> 43:52.338
-Ring?
-(sighs)

43:53.213 --> 43:56.008
Grace, um... (sighs)

43:56.091 --> 43:58.385
I've never been at a loss for words
until now.

44:00.220 --> 44:03.057
-Um...
-(gasps)

44:06.685 --> 44:07.519
Phil.

44:12.816 --> 44:14.818
For me? (exhales)

44:15.235 --> 44:18.280
Well, perhaps it's not the most
elegant surroundings,

44:19.406 --> 44:20.574
but, uh...

44:23.786 --> 44:26.872
Will you marry me, Grace?

44:35.089 --> 44:36.131
Oh, Phil.

44:40.386 --> 44:41.929
(sobs)

44:43.722 --> 44:45.265
I don't know what to say.

44:46.308 --> 44:47.476
Well, say yes.

44:49.186 --> 44:50.020
(sniffling)

44:52.648 --> 44:53.524
Oh.

45:02.241 --> 45:04.660
Excuse me, Francis.
Can I have a moment of your time?

45:05.202 --> 45:06.036
Sure, Phil.

45:19.883 --> 45:20.759
(sighs)

45:22.428 --> 45:23.345
(Phil sniffing)

45:24.930 --> 45:26.724
She said no to me, Francis.

45:29.059 --> 45:29.893
Grace?

45:30.853 --> 45:31.687
I'm sorry.

45:34.606 --> 45:37.693
She said, uh, I don't even know
what she said.

45:38.318 --> 45:40.028
She said that we didn't need
to get married.

45:40.112 --> 45:41.530
What the hell does that mean?

45:43.699 --> 45:45.534
Maybe she's a free spirit.

45:46.493 --> 45:49.496
I wanted children, Francis.
I'm not getting any younger.

45:52.624 --> 45:53.834
You gonna go on seeing her?

45:55.169 --> 45:56.086
I don't know.

45:57.379 --> 45:59.047
I ought to make a clean break.

46:01.633 --> 46:04.428
(sniffing, clears throat)

46:04.511 --> 46:06.930
Well, if you don't need me anymore, hmm?

46:08.432 --> 46:10.976
Sure. Take off.

46:15.272 --> 46:19.860
You know, it seems the Phantom struck, uh,
today under Dekker Avenue.

46:20.819 --> 46:21.695
Oh?

46:22.279 --> 46:24.281
Seems young Crawford overreacted somewhat

46:24.364 --> 46:27.743
and discharged his weapon
at point-blank range.

46:27.951 --> 46:29.870
(chuckles) Oh, he missed.

46:30.579 --> 46:32.748
That gag should have been retired
a long time ago, Phil.

46:32.956 --> 46:35.751
Tomorrow let's put Crawford
with Bobby Hill, okay?

46:36.043 --> 46:37.169
Yeah. That's a good idea.

46:43.133 --> 46:44.885
-Well...
-(slaps lap)

46:45.469 --> 46:47.137
If you don't need me anymore, hmm?

46:57.397 --> 46:59.525
Phil, how-how 'bout if I buy you a beer?

47:02.653 --> 47:03.904
That'd be nice, Francis.

47:06.698 --> 47:09.451
(dramatic music plays)

47:13.997 --> 47:14.873
(sniffs)

47:32.724 --> 47:33.851
So... (exhales)

47:37.604 --> 47:40.107
You really are a very nice man,
Joe Coffey.

47:41.900 --> 47:43.318
Yeah. I'm a regular prince.

47:46.572 --> 47:47.781
When can I see you again?

47:49.741 --> 47:51.493
I'll call you, okay?

47:53.161 --> 47:54.037
Okay.

48:05.048 --> 48:08.468
(dramatic music plays)

48:32.868 --> 48:35.370
(closing theme playing)
