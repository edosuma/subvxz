00:01.233 --> 00:02.366
Come on, let's see this at 7:30.

00:02.433 --> 00:03.800
‐ Then I want to see this‐‐
‐ 'So, ladies..'

00:05.666 --> 00:07.166
Y'all..

00:09.600 --> 00:11.300
Y'all picked the flick? Huh?

00:11.366 --> 00:13.833
I'm with, I'm with anything as
long as it is not one of those

00:13.900 --> 00:16.332
all men are dogs, burn his cot.

00:16.400 --> 00:20.166
Denzel come
and save my life, chick flicks.

00:20.233 --> 00:21.466
Like you didn't cry buckets

00:21.533 --> 00:23.200
when Big Mama died
in "Soul Food."

00:25.300 --> 00:27.600
Big Mama
meant everything to them girls.

Uh‐huh! So bunk
my 3 o'clock to 1 o'clock

01:04.540 --> 01:06.806
and then cancel
my lunch, alright?

01:06.873 --> 01:08.706
Good. Okay.

01:08.773 --> 01:11.040
Carol, you the woman. Alright.

01:11.106 --> 01:13.406
Hey, people, what y'all
got planned for me tonight?

01:13.473 --> 01:15.173
Uh, nothing. We're staying home.

01:17.673 --> 01:19.606
Look, dinner and a movie.

01:19.673 --> 01:21.306
Now you can come only

01:21.373 --> 01:24.506
if you promise
not to talk back to the screen.

01:24.573 --> 01:26.506
Last time,
the people can't hear you.

01:27.706 --> 01:30.440
I just realized
that from 10:15 to 10:59

01:30.506 --> 01:33.140
I'm meeting the Appellate Judge
online to review case law.

01:33.206 --> 01:35.540
That is, if I can get him
out of a judge duty chat room.

01:35.606 --> 01:38.073
I should be finished just
in time to be soaking in the tub

01:38.140 --> 01:39.540
watching
Cochrane and Company by 11.

01:39.606 --> 01:41.440
Look, let's skip the movie,
order takeout.

01:41.506 --> 01:43.040
How about Thai? I got coupons.

01:44.873 --> 01:46.940
Gee, you must be crazy.

01:47.006 --> 01:48.706
You're not messing up
our night just because

01:48.773 --> 01:50.740
of your hectic schedule.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.773
I mean, what happened
to the Max that asked us

01:52.840 --> 01:55.273
to move our refrigerator
next to the couch

01:55.340 --> 01:56.973
so she wouldn't have to get up.

01:58.473 --> 01:59.540
She woke up.

01:59.606 --> 02:01.080
[pager beeping]

02:01.146 --> 02:03.980
Kyle moving to London helped me
clean house emotionally

02:04.046 --> 02:05.180
and streamline my life.

02:05.246 --> 02:08.545
Now, at work, I'm a lean, mean,
plea bargain machine

02:08.613 --> 02:09.946
setting records
for not tying up the courts

02:10.013 --> 02:12.313
with those pesky trials.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.513
So why go to trial
at all, then, huh?

02:14.580 --> 02:16.480
Why not just flip a coin?

02:16.546 --> 02:19.179
Heads you walk, tails you fry.

02:21.646 --> 02:23.246
Khadijah, look

02:23.313 --> 02:26.046
95 percent of the cases
don't even to go trial anyway.

02:26.113 --> 02:27.446
Look, I'm just going
with the flow.

02:27.513 --> 02:30.213
If I can keep up this pace,
by the time I'm 35

02:30.280 --> 02:32.946
I'll be supreme court justice,
I'll be retired by 40

02:33.013 --> 02:34.480
and be naked on the beach
in the Caribbean

02:34.546 --> 02:35.980
by the time I'm 41.

02:39.713 --> 02:42.446
Hey, Bannon,
how's life deep inside

02:42.513 --> 02:44.613
the infested bowels
of the criminal wasteland.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.580
[chuckles]
Better now that you're
in the bowels with me.

02:47.646 --> 02:50.046
Uh‐huh, not for long, pal.

02:50.113 --> 02:54.446
All I've got is a shoplifter,
a trespasser and a spitter.

02:54.513 --> 02:55.980
I can blow through
these losers in an hour

02:56.046 --> 02:58.313
and make my 1 o'clock
braid‐tightening appointment.

03:00.453 --> 03:02.886
Oh, good morning.

03:02.953 --> 03:06.553
I am Maxine Shaw,
your court appointed attorney.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.153
Lucky you.

03:10.686 --> 03:13.020
Alright, Mr. Jackson.

03:13.086 --> 03:15.020
Do you understand
the charges against you?

03:15.086 --> 03:17.953
Yes, the hospital thinks
I was trespassing.

03:18.020 --> 03:20.653
Yeah...they tend to think that
when somebody's harassing

03:20.720 --> 03:23.086
patients after visiting hours
three fricking weeks in a row.

03:24.586 --> 03:26.153
You know what,
I like to call it

03:26.220 --> 03:28.286
comforting people
in their time of need.

03:32.020 --> 03:35.386
Right and a pickpocket just gets
rid of that bulge on your booty.

03:35.453 --> 03:38.353
Okay, listen, here's the drill.

03:38.420 --> 03:40.586
You plead guilty,
we get a reduced charge

03:40.653 --> 03:42.486
with a minimum sentence and fine
and you'll be back

03:42.553 --> 03:45.120
in the hospital, hittin' on
the sick and needy in no time.

03:46.953 --> 03:48.753
I'm not interested
in a plea bargain.

03:48.820 --> 03:50.753
I want to go to trial
and prove my innocence.

03:52.420 --> 03:55.453
What planet
are you living on, man?

03:55.520 --> 03:57.486
Look, I mean,
they've got videotape on you.

03:57.553 --> 03:58.820
They've got four witnesses

03:58.886 --> 04:00.726
and I've got a hair appointment
in less than an hour

04:00.793 --> 04:03.493
so, come on, walk the walk.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.993
But I haven't done
anything wrong.

04:06.060 --> 04:08.326
I was just working
for my father.

04:08.393 --> 04:10.293
Great, well..

04:10.360 --> 04:12.726
Okay, if we can prove
that he put you up to this

04:12.793 --> 04:15.093
we can probably get you off.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.625
Who's your daddy?

04:19.726 --> 04:21.160
The man upstairs.

04:24.693 --> 04:26.026
Judge Cartwright?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.393
A little higher.

04:30.460 --> 04:32.426
The mayor? The governor?

04:33.926 --> 04:35.459
President Clinton?

04:35.526 --> 04:37.593
Higher.

04:37.659 --> 04:38.926
Hillary?

04:42.793 --> 04:44.193
All the way up.

04:50.326 --> 04:52.693
So then that would make you..

04:52.760 --> 04:54.060
I'm back.

04:57.226 --> 05:00.166
[laughing]

05:02.066 --> 05:03.033
Oh, I'm back..

05:05.266 --> 05:07.500
Alright, I know,
I know what's going on here.

05:07.566 --> 05:10.000
Bannon put you up to this.
Bannon!

05:10.066 --> 05:12.066
Alright, the gloves are off.

05:12.133 --> 05:13.900
Next time you show me
that picture of your fiance

05:13.966 --> 05:16.000
I'm telling the truth.
She's a beast.

05:17.566 --> 05:18.500
‐ Miss, Miss Shaw.
‐ Ohh!

05:18.566 --> 05:20.633
Miss Shaw.
Miss Shaw, this is no joke.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.333
I really am the son of God.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.533
Yeah and I'm Joan of Arc.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.866
Where were you
when they were burning me up?

05:24.933 --> 05:26.400
That fire was a bear.

05:28.333 --> 05:31.233
Why is it whenever I tell people
who I really am, they overreact?

05:31.300 --> 05:33.500
I.. I'm not overreacting. I'm..

05:34.966 --> 05:36.233
[chuckles]

05:37.400 --> 05:38.866
I'm totally on board.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.366
So we're going to need
some character witnesses.

05:51.466 --> 05:53.566
How many of the apostles
can you round up?

05:59.700 --> 06:01.006
People..

06:01.073 --> 06:03.340
...Yoda.

06:03.406 --> 06:04.840
Sorry, I'm late.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.806
I got stuck in lock‐up
with some crazy brother

06:06.873 --> 06:09.140
who thinks he's the son of God.

06:09.206 --> 06:11.506
Oh, I met a man
on the subway once

06:11.573 --> 06:13.506
who had a sock puppet,
he said it was Gandhi.

06:14.706 --> 06:17.640
I didn't buy it though
but he had a brown sock

06:17.706 --> 06:19.040
that sounded
just like Luther Vandross.

06:19.106 --> 06:22.273
Woow, woo, woo! It's fake.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.040
(Max)
'Well, at least you could
ditch him at the next stop.'

06:24.106 --> 06:26.206
I mean, this clown wants me
to try his case.

06:26.273 --> 06:30.173
Like, go to trial,
in a courtroom.

06:30.240 --> 06:33.173
Well, maybe he means
son of God, like

06:33.240 --> 06:35.606
you know,
we're all children of God.

06:35.673 --> 06:39.040
Well, uh,
all of us but the termite.

06:39.106 --> 06:42.406
I mean, if you ask me,
they just the demon's spawn.

06:44.540 --> 06:46.506
So, what's the charge?

06:46.573 --> 06:49.373
Wearing sandals and sack cloth
after Labor Day?

06:49.440 --> 06:51.040
[chuckling]

06:51.106 --> 06:52.373
Trespassing.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.906
He was caught
in the county hospital

06:54.973 --> 06:56.173
after visiting hours

06:56.240 --> 06:57.673
whispering
words of encouragement

06:57.740 --> 07:00.013
to the sick and dying.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.380
That heathen!

07:01.446 --> 07:04.080
Why don't y'all just lock him up
and throw away the key?

07:05.480 --> 07:07.413
Max, come on now, now
you are talking about this guy

07:07.480 --> 07:09.846
as if you know for sure,
I mean, who is to say

07:09.913 --> 07:12.280
that he's not the real thing?

07:12.346 --> 07:14.313
Yeah, I don't know, wait,
'cause, you know he did say

07:14.380 --> 07:16.346
he was going to come back
one day, you know.

07:18.446 --> 07:21.513
And, and
carpenter's son don't lie.

07:21.580 --> 07:24.880
All I'm saying is, he didn't
look like the savior to me.

07:24.946 --> 07:26.380
Wha‐wha‐wha, wait,
wha‐what, what because

07:26.446 --> 07:27.580
he didn't have blonde hair

07:27.646 --> 07:30.046
and blue eyes
and a Hollywood smile?

07:30.113 --> 07:32.413
I, for one believe
Jesus was a brother.

07:36.446 --> 07:38.380
Yes, yes.

07:38.446 --> 07:40.080
Well, now the Bible
does describe him

07:40.146 --> 07:43.280
as having what hair of wool
and‐and‐and feet of clay.

07:43.346 --> 07:44.413
Hair of wool,
feet of clay, that's what.

07:44.480 --> 07:45.580
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

07:45.646 --> 07:47.280
I don't know why feet of clay
would make me think

07:47.346 --> 07:48.446
that he's a brother though.

07:48.513 --> 07:49.480
O‐o‐okay, okay.

07:49.546 --> 07:51.513
See, I‐I‐I worked this out.

07:51.580 --> 07:54.046
Clay meaning like dirt and dust,
it means he was ashen

07:54.113 --> 07:56.046
that's how you know
he was a brother.

07:56.113 --> 07:59.180
Jesus was a brother.
Jesus was a brother. I know.

08:02.053 --> 08:03.553
But he didn't say anything
about him wearing

08:03.620 --> 08:05.186
the jail jumpsuit,
cheap sneakers

08:05.253 --> 08:07.286
and the trace of Polo cologne.

08:08.886 --> 08:13.153
Well, uh, i‐i‐if he is the Lord,
he should be wearing Eternity.

08:13.220 --> 08:15.120
That is a good one.
That is a good one.

08:15.186 --> 08:17.453
(Regina)
'You..'

08:17.520 --> 08:20.420
You know what, Max, you should
let me interview this guy.

08:20.486 --> 08:23.253
I mean,
there might be a story here.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.653
Jesus is back
and New York's got him.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.220
Please, no, no, no, no.

08:27.286 --> 08:29.053
It's bad enough the screwball
has thrown off

08:29.120 --> 08:30.486
my rocket sledge to retirement.

08:30.553 --> 08:31.920
Now you want to write about it.

08:31.986 --> 08:34.586
Why do I get all the nut cases?

08:34.653 --> 08:35.953
Food for thought, Max.

08:36.020 --> 08:38.120
Wouldn't it be ironic
if you get to the pearly gates

08:38.186 --> 08:40.385
and there's your client saying,
"Told you so."

08:43.720 --> 08:46.486
Wait a minute,
M‐Max...in heaven?

08:46.553 --> 08:49.820
Oh, I don't think this one
she got to worry about.

08:49.886 --> 08:51.353
‐ You stop that now.
‐ She ain't going there.

08:51.420 --> 08:52.720
(Synclaire)
'You just stop that now!'

08:52.786 --> 08:54.520
'Please, stop that now.
Stop that..'

09:00.053 --> 09:02.126
Bannon,
aren't there any rules about

09:02.193 --> 09:03.660
who gets in to see my client?

09:03.726 --> 09:05.460
Hey, she was packing
a black forest cake

09:05.526 --> 09:07.526
still warm from the oven.

09:08.826 --> 09:10.493
Sorry, Max,
you know, but sometimes

09:10.560 --> 09:12.693
the first amendment
needs a little nudge.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.793
A little fudge too, hey, Bannon?

09:16.393 --> 09:18.826
Hey, I did a little
background check on this guy.

09:18.893 --> 09:22.260
Guess what he did before
he took up this Messiah gig?

09:22.326 --> 09:23.526
Oh, I don't know.

09:23.593 --> 09:25.660
Travel with the touring company
of Godspell?

09:27.060 --> 09:29.060
He was a corporate raider

09:29.126 --> 09:31.493
but the pressure got to him
and he cracked.

09:31.560 --> 09:34.260
So now he goes around
the hospitals, churches

09:34.326 --> 09:37.493
and soup kitchens,
inspiring people.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.860
And stirring up the soup.

09:40.126 --> 09:43.093
Save the intimate portrait
for my replacement.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.093
I'll talk to my boss
into getting me off this case.

09:45.160 --> 09:48.660
I'm just here to tell him
good luck and good riddance.

09:48.726 --> 09:51.493
B‐b‐but I was going to put you
on the cover of my magazine.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.893
With a halo over your head.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.960
Hey, I guess I got to just
change that halo

09:56.026 --> 09:57.960
to a couple of red horns.

10:05.766 --> 10:08.833
Um, look, dude.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.366
I don't know why
I came down here

10:10.433 --> 10:13.333
to tell you this in person but
I just wanted to let you know

10:13.400 --> 10:16.066
that they'll be assigning you
a new attorney.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.166
I'm out.

10:18.266 --> 10:19.366
Fine.

10:19.433 --> 10:21.300
Good, because I..

10:21.366 --> 10:23.566
Just like that?

10:23.633 --> 10:26.133
You're just going
to let me walk?

10:26.200 --> 10:27.333
No begging me to stay?

10:27.400 --> 10:29.666
No, "My father's
not going to like this."

10:32.400 --> 10:34.500
You coming off a really rough
time in your life, you know.

10:34.566 --> 10:37.266
You put your heart out there,
you got stepped on.

10:37.333 --> 10:38.966
I understand why you
wouldn't want to take any risk.

10:39.033 --> 10:42.100
Wait, wait, how do..
How do you know that?

10:42.166 --> 10:44.433
Khadija.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.466
Khadija told you
my business, didn't she?

10:48.600 --> 10:51.666
Well, here's a little something
you should know about her.

10:51.733 --> 10:53.766
For two whole years,
she didn't go to church.

10:53.833 --> 10:55.700
She slept in every Sunday

10:55.766 --> 10:57.100
sometimes with somebody.

10:59.133 --> 11:00.606
Khadija didn't tell me anything.

11:00.673 --> 11:03.306
Insight, kinda comes
with the territory.

11:08.906 --> 11:10.606
Uh, eh. Hey,
do I make you uncomfortable?

11:10.673 --> 11:13.173
Uh, no. Of course not.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.640
Don't flatter yourself.

11:19.540 --> 11:22.473
Alright, you all that!

11:23.440 --> 11:25.506
Perform a miracle.

11:25.573 --> 11:28.573
Here, levitate this desk.
Bust out of here.

11:28.640 --> 11:31.073
Make Bannon smell better.

11:31.140 --> 11:33.706
Miss Shaw,
I am not David Copperfield.

11:33.773 --> 11:35.273
Although I do enjoy his work.

11:35.340 --> 11:37.340
Did you see him
make that 747 disappear?

11:37.406 --> 11:39.073
How does he do that?

11:41.540 --> 11:44.906
Like this.
"Now you see me, now you don't."

11:44.973 --> 11:46.906
You really don't belong
in this case anyway.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.073
You've become
too afraid of losing.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.106
I'm not afraid of losing.

11:52.173 --> 11:54.006
This case is un‐winnable.

11:54.073 --> 11:55.440
Yeah, but that never
bothered you before.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.173
Remember
when you were a little girl?

11:57.240 --> 11:58.606
You know, no matter
how many dirty tricks

11:58.673 --> 11:59.773
your brother played on you

11:59.840 --> 12:01.546
you were so determined
to win at Monopoly‐‐

12:01.613 --> 12:04.480
Oh, yeah, he used to hide money
underneath the board

12:04.546 --> 12:05.813
and short change me on rent

12:05.880 --> 12:07.713
and he'd never let me roll
with both dice

12:07.780 --> 12:09.180
and how did you know that?

12:09.246 --> 12:10.980
Don't tell me.

12:13.046 --> 12:14.746
Don't wanna know.

12:14.813 --> 12:17.280
Good luck and goodbye.

12:21.946 --> 12:24.146
Alright, I'm back on the case..

12:25.780 --> 12:29.180
...and I'm gonna figure out
a way to win.

12:29.246 --> 12:31.680
You were looking for a miracle?

12:31.746 --> 12:33.946
Ooh! There it is.

12:44.046 --> 12:45.846
Cookies!

12:45.913 --> 12:49.946
Hey, so how did the holy man
take you dumping him?

12:50.013 --> 12:52.446
How you kicked off
the Church softball team?

12:52.513 --> 12:53.746
[laughing]

12:53.813 --> 12:55.746
No, I'm still on the case.

12:57.013 --> 13:01.320
Oh, looked into his eyes,
didn't you?

13:01.386 --> 13:02.453
Yes, Khadija, and I saw

13:02.520 --> 13:04.986
the mysteries
of the universe in there.

13:05.053 --> 13:06.353
Please? Come on.

13:06.420 --> 13:09.653
The guy needed a lawyer
and I'm the best. Case closed.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.786
So you really think
you could prove his innocence?

13:11.853 --> 13:13.486
What's that got
to do with anything?

13:13.553 --> 13:16.986
Look, trial law in the 90s
is not about arguing the case

13:17.053 --> 13:18.753
based on it's merits,
it's about

13:18.820 --> 13:19.986
smoke and mirrors, baby.

13:20.053 --> 13:21.953
It's about temporary
freaking insanity.

13:22.020 --> 13:26.320
Your Honor, my,
my client didn't shoot anybody.

13:26.386 --> 13:29.253
The 16 Twinkies he had for
breakfast pulled that trigger.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.920
So what's next, you're going to
come up with some catchy phrase

13:33.986 --> 13:36.520
for your defense like, uh..

13:36.586 --> 13:39.086
"If he heals the sick,
you must acquit."

13:40.953 --> 13:43.020
You know if that rhymed a little
bit better, I could use that.

13:43.086 --> 13:46.186
Nah! Nope. I'm going
for hospital negligence.

13:46.253 --> 13:47.920
I'm going to point
the finger at the accuser.

13:47.986 --> 13:49.786
I'm going to
the night nurse on the stand

13:49.853 --> 13:52.320
and reduce her
to a weeping mass of jelly.

13:52.386 --> 13:54.120
God! I miss this.

13:56.286 --> 13:57.686
Max, where is your heart?

13:57.753 --> 14:00.153
What? My heart? Oh, please.

14:00.220 --> 14:03.026
They make you get rid of that
the minute you pass the bar.

14:06.093 --> 14:08.260
Miss Fitzgerald..

14:08.326 --> 14:10.660
...do you recognize
the burnt out light bulb

14:10.726 --> 14:12.126
I hold in my hand?

14:12.193 --> 14:14.026
Uh, no.

14:16.293 --> 14:17.393
Really?

14:19.026 --> 14:21.593
It is the very bulb
that was supposed to be

14:21.660 --> 14:24.060
illuminating
the visiting hour sign

14:24.126 --> 14:26.060
next to your desk in the ICU.

14:26.126 --> 14:29.560
Now, I ask again.
Do you recognize this bulb?

14:31.293 --> 14:32.526
I‐I guess.

14:33.793 --> 14:35.926
You‐you‐you‐you guess?

14:37.460 --> 14:38.793
You guess?

14:38.860 --> 14:40.660
Oh, I'm sure
your patients would be thrilled

14:40.726 --> 14:43.826
to know that when called
to the task, you guess.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.526
"Is that the right
dose of medicine?"

14:46.593 --> 14:48.526
"I guess."

14:48.593 --> 14:50.760
"Is that flat line
on the monitor a good sign?"

14:50.826 --> 14:53.060
"I guess."

14:53.126 --> 14:54.260
Why are you doing this to me?

14:54.326 --> 14:55.726
[crying]

14:55.793 --> 14:56.860
I'm a good nurse.

14:56.926 --> 14:59.326
I was nurse of the month, twice.

14:59.393 --> 15:01.000
You were or you guess you were?

15:01.066 --> 15:02.033
[sobbing]
Oh!

15:02.100 --> 15:03.033
Objection, Your Honor

15:03.100 --> 15:04.833
she's badgering the witness.

15:04.900 --> 15:05.966
Sustained.

15:06.033 --> 15:08.966
Miss Shaw,
in a span of a few short hours

15:09.033 --> 15:12.066
you've turned my court room
into bad dinner theater.

15:12.133 --> 15:14.466
We're gonna take a,
a short recess

15:14.533 --> 15:16.466
so you can reflect
on your career.

15:16.533 --> 15:19.766
'Five minute recess. You may
step down, Miss Fitzgerald.'

15:19.833 --> 15:21.533
Does anyone have a Valium?

15:23.133 --> 15:24.700
[laughs]

15:24.766 --> 15:26.933
The witness
is trembling and dizzy.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.166
Shaw's on a roll.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.600
That nurse was tougher
than I expected

15:31.666 --> 15:33.233
but the candy striper,
she's going to crack

15:33.300 --> 15:34.833
like a window pane.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.833
Listen, Miss Shaw,
you're losing.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.900
Well, what kind of strategy
do you suggest?

15:40.966 --> 15:43.166
Turn a little water into wine
and get the judge drunk?

15:44.866 --> 15:46.566
A wise man once said

15:46.633 --> 15:49.000
"The truth shall set you free."

15:49.833 --> 15:51.100
Hey, that was me.

15:53.100 --> 15:56.233
Look, I'm the lawyer here.
I know how to work the system.

15:56.300 --> 15:59.233
Oh, yes.
Smoke and mirrors, baby. Right.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.973
Oh, by the way,
I'm not a Twinkies man

16:01.040 --> 16:03.806
but if it'll help, I've been
known to have nacho or two.

16:08.606 --> 16:10.540
Quit telling him my stuff.

16:11.740 --> 16:12.840
I didn't.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.106
Creepy, huh?

16:19.040 --> 16:21.806
What do you want from me, man?

16:21.873 --> 16:24.740
Miss Shaw, I want you
to look inside yourself

16:24.806 --> 16:26.473
and tell me who you are.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.706
‐ Maxine Shaw.
‐ Attorney at law.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.973
I know it rhymes really nice

16:34.040 --> 16:35.906
but there's got
to be more to you than that.

16:35.973 --> 16:38.340
What do you stand for?
What do you care about?

16:38.406 --> 16:40.540
What drives you to get
out of bed in the morning?

16:40.606 --> 16:42.206
Besides breakfast?

16:47.040 --> 16:48.306
I don't know!

16:49.106 --> 16:50.273
Finally..

16:51.206 --> 16:53.273
...we're getting to some truth.

16:57.673 --> 17:01.146
Your Honor, four witnesses
and 20 minutes of videotape

17:01.213 --> 17:04.012
confirms the defendant's
presence in intensive care

17:04.079 --> 17:06.980
after visiting hours
during the weeks in question.

17:07.046 --> 17:10.746
He's guilty of trespassing,
Your Honor. Prosecution rests.

17:10.813 --> 17:12.213
(male #1)
'Thank you, Mr. Rose.'

17:12.280 --> 17:13.713
"Brevity is the soul of wit."

17:13.780 --> 17:16.079
I say that for your benefit,
Miss Shaw.

17:19.780 --> 17:22.079
Anybody ever seen
one of these shermangies?

17:23.813 --> 17:26.380
It's an electronic organizer.

17:26.445 --> 17:29.913
Schedules your whole life
right down to the minute.

17:29.980 --> 17:31.580
Meetings, court dates

17:31.646 --> 17:34.080
"American Gladiators"
face off of the century.

17:34.146 --> 17:35.313
[laughs]

17:35.380 --> 17:36.746
'And you know what?'

17:36.813 --> 17:39.180
I'd be one lost puppy without it

17:39.246 --> 17:42.680
because my whole damn life
is run by it.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.280
Max, what the..

17:49.680 --> 17:52.213
How will she live? Let's watch.

17:53.580 --> 17:54.780
Miss Shaw, I would caution you

17:54.846 --> 17:56.546
that the insanity plea

17:56.613 --> 17:59.613
is meant for the defendant,
not counsel.

17:59.680 --> 18:02.620
Oh, I‐I'm crazy, Your Honor.
I'm‐I'm certifiable.

18:02.686 --> 18:04.720
I'm‐I'm‐I'm off
the freaking deep end.

18:04.786 --> 18:06.820
I‐I call myself to the stand.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.220
I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

18:08.286 --> 18:10.353
and nothing but the truth,
so help me God.

18:10.420 --> 18:13.486
Everything in here is backwards.

18:13.553 --> 18:15.353
It's the lawyers
that should be taking that oath.

18:15.420 --> 18:17.320
Can you imagine what kind of
legal system we have

18:17.386 --> 18:19.653
if the lawyers
would take that oath?

18:19.720 --> 18:21.586
Miss Shaw,
you're bordering on contempt.

18:21.653 --> 18:23.686
Oh, you know
what I find contemptible?

18:23.753 --> 18:25.953
Nobody is interested
in the truth.

18:26.020 --> 18:30.353
Everybody is just
trying to win at‐at any cost.

18:30.420 --> 18:34.953
Larry, babe,
congratulations on putting away

18:35.020 --> 18:36.653
that good Samaritan,
you remember the one

18:36.720 --> 18:39.253
that was feeding everybody
else's parking meters?

18:39.320 --> 18:41.520
Yeah, yeah, you know,
I‐I'm sure we're all sleeping

18:41.586 --> 18:43.986
real easy at night
knowing that menace to society

18:44.053 --> 18:46.020
is off the streets,
aren't we, folks?

18:46.086 --> 18:48.353
Your Honor.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.753
No, we'll let her have
a little bit more rope.

18:52.686 --> 18:54.086
Thank you, Your Honor.

18:54.153 --> 18:58.186
My client,
Walter Jackson is guilty.

18:58.253 --> 19:01.760
Guilty, guilty, guilty
according to the law.

19:03.326 --> 19:04.893
'He was found wandering'

19:04.960 --> 19:07.460
after visiting hours
in a hospital.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.226
But who did he really hurt?

19:11.293 --> 19:13.960
These people were
patients in the ICU

19:14.026 --> 19:15.593
when my client made his rounds.

19:15.660 --> 19:17.826
Mr. Olsen had
a massive heart attack.

19:17.893 --> 19:20.126
Thought he was going to die.

19:22.026 --> 19:26.060
Walter kept him company
into the wee hours of the night.

19:27.926 --> 19:31.026
Mrs. Hanley, she contracted
Salmonella poisoning.

19:31.093 --> 19:32.693
She wanted to die.

19:32.760 --> 19:35.160
Walter held her hair
while she puked into a bedpan.

19:36.860 --> 19:40.126
And, uh, Mr. Taylor here,
he was in a coma, right?

19:40.193 --> 19:41.526
'Yeah.'

19:41.593 --> 19:44.960
Then he heard Walter's voice
telling him to come back

19:45.026 --> 19:47.626
because
he was still needed here.

19:47.693 --> 19:50.126
Well, here he is.

19:50.193 --> 19:52.626
Coincidence? You tell me.

19:55.060 --> 19:58.893
The truth is Walter Jackson
helped these people

19:58.960 --> 19:59.900
and we wanna punish him

19:59.966 --> 20:02.533
because
he didn't look at his watch?

20:02.600 --> 20:04.800
Is that the kind of system
that works for you?

20:04.866 --> 20:07.300
Because they sure as hell
don't work for me.

20:07.366 --> 20:10.066
You tell them.
You tell them, Max.

20:13.466 --> 20:16.300
Truth is in the house.

20:16.366 --> 20:18.966
Whatever, let's see
how far it gets us.

20:19.033 --> 20:20.666
Is it my turn now?

20:20.733 --> 20:22.366
[laughing]

20:22.433 --> 20:23.733
I'm ready to rule.

20:27.866 --> 20:29.900
In the case
of the City of New York

20:29.966 --> 20:31.000
versus Walter Jackson

20:31.066 --> 20:34.166
I find
the defendant guilty as charged.

20:34.233 --> 20:38.066
$1500 and 14 days in jail.
Court is adjourned.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.366
So how do you feel?

20:43.633 --> 20:47.533
Exhilarated, confused, pissed,
nauseous, constipated

20:47.600 --> 20:50.466
just to damn lost.

20:50.533 --> 20:53.533
Good.
Then the journey can begin.

20:55.233 --> 20:56.200
Journey, what journey?

20:56.266 --> 20:58.000
Would you stop
speaking in riddles.

20:58.066 --> 20:59.300
You see that man there.

20:59.366 --> 21:01.706
He's about to haul
your butt off to jail.

21:01.773 --> 21:04.306
That's my pass.
I'll walk it proudly.

21:06.173 --> 21:07.640
You're a strange man, Walter.

21:07.706 --> 21:10.273
You're a good man,
but you're strange.

21:12.873 --> 21:14.906
I just wish
I could have done more for you.

21:16.940 --> 21:18.506
You still don't understand,
do you?

21:20.006 --> 21:22.106
These last few days,
they weren't for me.

21:23.540 --> 21:24.873
They were for you.

21:33.806 --> 21:36.040
And Lord knows you needed it.

21:41.106 --> 21:43.806
