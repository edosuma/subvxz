32:43.587 --> 32:45.130
It's not a cheap
or leisured venture.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.632
Precisely why
I am here to see you.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.303
I need the support
of a seasoned professional

32:51.469 --> 32:54.139
if I am to win the approval
of the committee.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.558
Seasoned.
I am not a boiled rabbit.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.351
I think you will have
better luck elsewhere.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.020
Adieu. Au revoir.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.313
You know investors,

33:01.688 --> 33:04.691
and you have a seemingly
intimate relationship

33:04.858 --> 33:06.401
with the singer
I want to make my lead.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.111
(INHALES SHARPLY)

33:08.195 --> 33:09.863
Produce my opera.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.823
My production
will not disappoint

33:11.907 --> 33:14.576
and everyone will know
you had a hand in its success.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.789
I'm finishing a new novel,

33:20.916 --> 33:22.375
The Anonymous Lover.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.377
It is notably more mature

33:24.461 --> 33:26.588
than the children's stories
I am known for.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.965
Love triangles, widows,
that sort of thing.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.425
JOSEPH: Mm.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.010
So...

33:33.470 --> 33:36.556
I will produce your opera
on one condition.

33:37.515 --> 33:38.558
That when we defeat Gluck

33:38.642 --> 33:41.144
and rub his nose
in all that greasy smarm,

33:41.561 --> 33:42.646
that you will adapt my novel

33:42.729 --> 33:44.814
and put it on stage
at the Palais Royal.

33:46.316 --> 33:48.401
It would be my honor
to do so, madame.

33:49.402 --> 33:50.403
Really?

33:50.570 --> 33:52.072
Yes. (LAUGHS)

33:52.155 --> 33:53.406
(CHUCKLES IN DISBELIEF)

33:54.324 --> 33:55.325
Right.

33:56.576 --> 33:59.621
Well, then I shall schedule
some meetings with investors.

33:59.829 --> 34:02.040
We need a venue, an orchestra,
designers, painters.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.375
And a lead.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.252
I would like to start
with the lead.

34:05.418 --> 34:07.128
If you are serious
about Marie-Joséphine,

34:07.212 --> 34:08.713
you will need to speak
with her husband.

34:08.797 --> 34:09.798
He's often occupied

34:09.881 --> 34:11.383
but I believe
my familial relationship

34:11.466 --> 34:12.717
may be helpful there.

34:13.343 --> 34:15.053
Right. Much to do. Off I go.

to pay for that, I'm afraid.

de Saint-Georges. Welcome.

34:55.135 --> 34:57.262
Ah, so you remember who I am.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.514
Yes. The man with
all the fancy accomplishments.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.601
I'm here to sit down
with you and your husband.

35:03.768 --> 35:04.936
Is he about?

35:05.437 --> 35:06.896
He'll be along shortly.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.899
My curiosity overflows.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.235
What brings you here?
My cousin would not say.

35:12.402 --> 35:13.987
I am in need of a singer.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.530
The lead.

35:16.656 --> 35:17.949
You see, I am to compete
for the position

35:18.033 --> 35:19.284
of director
of the Paris Opera.

35:19.367 --> 35:21.620
Yes, I know. All of Paris
is speaking of it.

35:21.703 --> 35:22.746
But surely there are talents

35:22.829 --> 35:24.664
better suited
for your performance.

35:25.415 --> 35:27.334
You've only heard me
sing once. I could be

35:28.335 --> 35:29.336
terrible.

35:30.587 --> 35:31.963
You aren't.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.343
Fine. Let us assume
I'm an excellent singer

35:36.426 --> 35:38.178
and a world-class actress.

35:39.929 --> 35:41.014
Convince me.

35:41.097 --> 35:43.058
-Of?
-Your opera.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.142
Sell it to me.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.019
You cannot expect
a performer of my talents

35:46.102 --> 35:48.605
to just attach herself to
any silly old thing, can you?

35:48.688 --> 35:49.689
Well...

35:50.440 --> 35:52.192
Well, it is called Ernestine.

35:52.359 --> 35:54.569
Ah. And that would be me?

35:54.652 --> 35:55.737
Yes.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.198
-Tell me about her.
-She's an orphan.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.366
-Tragic.
-It is.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.202
She is a brilliant artist

36:02.619 --> 36:03.870
who earns a scant living

36:03.953 --> 36:05.455
teaching art
in her small town.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.625
A handsome soldier
romances her,

36:08.708 --> 36:09.834
moves her to Paris,

36:09.918 --> 36:12.962
but then must leave
to go off to war.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.924
The soldier's penniless
when he returns.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.593
He overlooks
Ernestine altogether

36:18.676 --> 36:20.428
and proposes
to a rich heiress.

36:21.763 --> 36:24.057
He uproots her
and deserts her.

36:24.140 --> 36:27.060
-(TUTS) The bastard.
-Indeed he is.

36:29.604 --> 36:32.023
Soon the soldier
is despondent.

36:33.733 --> 36:35.402
He misses Ernestine.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.947
He realizes her art,

36:40.782 --> 36:42.075
her talent,

36:43.451 --> 36:44.828
her tender soul

36:45.954 --> 36:48.415
will make him happier
than fortune ever could.

36:49.249 --> 36:51.584
And Ernestine accepts
the soldier even though

36:52.001 --> 36:55.255
he's stupid and penniless?

36:58.550 --> 36:59.551
Yes.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.220
Why?

37:02.387 --> 37:04.264
Because he truly loves her.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.558
And despite his wrongs,

37:07.058 --> 37:09.394
she knows
she deserves to be loved.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.438
Truly...

37:13.898 --> 37:15.358
and fully loved.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.657
And of course,
the music will be spectacular.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.284
Bold!

37:33.710 --> 37:35.587
Forgive my tardiness.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.048
Chevalier, this is the Marquis
de Montalembert. My husband.

37:42.051 --> 37:45.138
Famed mulatto
of La Boëssière's Academy.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.640
A welcome guest to be sure.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.225
I like your toys.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.228
Replicas.

37:52.896 --> 37:54.939
Come, Chevalier, please.

37:55.732 --> 37:58.276
I would like to show you
some of my bigger toys.

38:04.032 --> 38:06.409
JOSEPH: I understand the Queen
keeps your calendar busy.

38:06.493 --> 38:07.577
MONTALEMBERT: Indeed.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.622
I fought for this country
in the Rhine,

38:10.705 --> 38:12.832
in Italy, in Bohemia.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.168
It is my God-given purpose

38:15.251 --> 38:18.254
to defend this country
from all its enemies.

38:18.755 --> 38:20.882
Even from enemies at home.

38:22.425 --> 38:23.676
You mean spies?

38:23.843 --> 38:24.844
Traitors.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.347
Agitators from within
this country,

38:27.430 --> 38:29.265
born of this nation,

38:29.724 --> 38:31.810
who would like to see
our queen burn.

38:32.602 --> 38:35.730
Their lot's more terrifying
than any Bohemian or Italian.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.190
JOSEPH: Surely they're not
a genuine threat.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.775
MONTALEMBERT:
If only that were so.

38:38.858 --> 38:40.985
I have designed
many a fortress.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.613
It is a precise science,
keeping your enemies out.

38:43.696 --> 38:44.864
But what does one do
when the enemy

38:44.948 --> 38:47.116
is not found
outside the fortress?

38:47.200 --> 38:48.409
What to do when the enemy

38:48.493 --> 38:50.870
was within the fortress
all along?

38:50.954 --> 38:51.955
Hmm?

38:53.331 --> 38:56.000
France is the greatest nation
in the world.

38:56.209 --> 38:57.835
In any other country,

38:58.002 --> 38:59.337
a man of your color

38:59.879 --> 39:02.632
would not be wearing
such fine clothes

39:03.216 --> 39:04.717
or be so boldly

39:05.426 --> 39:08.471

in his own drawing room.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.017
Excuse me, Marquis,

39:13.351 --> 39:16.104
but I only wish for your wife
to sing in my opera.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.189
It is a charming libretto,
if I may...

39:18.273 --> 39:20.608
I have no affection for art.

39:21.651 --> 39:25.405
I have no interest in sitting
for hours at the opera

39:25.572 --> 39:29.742
or staring at paintings
of ponds or flowers.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.662
Let me be clear.

39:33.246 --> 39:35.290
The very idea
of Marie-Joséphine

39:35.373 --> 39:36.958
parading around a stage

39:37.083 --> 39:39.377
is more than unsavory.

like to perform in your opera.

I will. It'll be my burden
to bear, not yours.

42:03.271 --> 42:04.814
Well, I'd hate
for my little opera

42:04.897 --> 42:06.733

to do with one another.

I have been a friend to you,

one crucial fact.

arrogance and your disrespect.

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:31.040

in the street are fools!

01:34:31.708 --> 01:34:33.501

01:34:39.924 --> 01:34:42.051
my guards
will arrest you at once.

01:34:43.219 --> 01:34:45.680
I will take
everything from you.

01:34:46.723 --> 01:34:48.600
I will strip you
of your title.

01:34:49.225 --> 01:34:51.185
You will no longer
be a Chevalier.

01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:53.771
You will be nothing.

01:34:53.938 --> 01:34:55.773
