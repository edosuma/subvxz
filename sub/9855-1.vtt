<i>Like all good stories</i>

00:05.050 --> 00:07.435
<i>This one starts</i>
<i>with a beautiful woman,</i>

00:07.486 --> 00:12.557

00:39.751 --> 00:42.420
Ah!

00:54.433 --> 00:57.535
Help me!

01:32.638 --> 01:35.156
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>this story also starts</i>

01:35.191 --> 01:37.275
<i>with the end of that life...</i>

01:37.309 --> 01:39.160
<i>With her murder.</i>

01:54.460 --> 01:58.162
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning.

01:58.180 --> 01:59.297
Morning, major.

01:59.331 --> 02:01.349
Good morning.

02:01.383 --> 02:03.635
What are you doing here, Louis?

02:03.669 --> 02:05.353
It's Major Daniel,

02:05.387 --> 02:06.888
and I'm here because

02:06.939 --> 02:09.357
I am a member of
the National Police.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.725
Did you send her?

02:10.776 --> 02:11.726
No.

02:11.777 --> 02:13.177
But she's with me.

02:13.695 --> 02:16.447
You are no longer
in the 36, major.

02:16.481 --> 02:18.348
I'm in charge now.

02:18.366 --> 02:20.735
When I was in charge,

02:20.786 --> 02:23.788
I didn't feel the need
to tell everyone.

02:32.131 --> 02:33.298
You were right.

02:33.332 --> 02:34.882
This was the same killer.

02:52.101 --> 02:54.235
Ah!

03:05.564 --> 03:07.415
<i>I was not in a good way.</i>

03:07.449 --> 03:09.250
<i>The truth is,</i>

03:09.285 --> 03:12.086
<i>there were days,</i>
<i>I thought about just giving up.</i>

03:12.121 --> 03:14.505
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>keeping me alive was anger</i>

03:14.540 --> 03:15.540
<i>and morphine.</i>

03:18.594 --> 03:20.044
Commissaire Laveaux.

03:20.078 --> 03:21.245
I need you to keep
this scene sealed

03:21.263 --> 03:22.513
for a couple of days.

03:22.548 --> 03:23.715
Then you have no authority

03:23.749 --> 03:24.882
to seal the scene.

03:24.916 --> 03:26.684
I'm not ordering you.

03:26.719 --> 03:27.935
I'm asking you,

03:27.970 --> 03:29.937
because this may not
be the first victim.

03:29.972 --> 03:32.724
I've had no notification
of any other murder.

03:32.758 --> 03:34.993
That's because she's
the first French victim.

03:35.027 --> 03:37.928
A serial killer is in France.

03:37.946 --> 03:39.564
You have a chance to catch him.

03:39.598 --> 03:40.865
Me?

03:40.899 --> 03:43.100
I need a few days,
and, at the right moment,

03:43.118 --> 03:45.236
I will turn everything

03:45.270 --> 03:46.237
over to you.

03:46.271 --> 03:47.772
You'll take no credit?

03:47.790 --> 03:49.106
No.

03:49.124 --> 03:51.709
Two days.

03:51.744 --> 03:53.961
And I want to be kept informed

03:53.996 --> 03:55.330
of any progress.

03:55.381 --> 03:56.781
Thank you.

03:58.217 --> 04:00.451
The scene will be kept closed.

04:01.446 --> 04:03.175
Where are you going?

04:03.295 --> 04:04.891
Amsterdam.

04:08.927 --> 04:12.563
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>how much that poor young girl,</i>

04:12.598 --> 04:14.816
<i>dead in a park</i>
<i>in the middle of Paris,</i>

04:14.850 --> 04:17.735
<i>was about to change my life.</i>

04:33.369 --> 04:35.002
What the hell
do you mean, "no"?

04:35.037 --> 04:36.087
It's okay,
darling. We can...

04:36.121 --> 04:37.372
Guess
my wife's weight!

04:37.423 --> 04:39.040
I don't do that.

04:39.091 --> 04:40.324
I paid my money!

04:40.342 --> 04:41.592
I read cards.

04:41.627 --> 04:43.544
I can tell you some things
about yourself

04:43.595 --> 04:45.129
and maybe give you
some insight into...

04:45.163 --> 04:46.097
I paid my money.

04:46.131 --> 04:47.632
Now guess her weight!

04:47.666 --> 04:49.550
Hey, why don't you
just leave her alone, pal?

04:50.886 --> 04:53.805
Why don't you mind
your own business?

04:55.057 --> 04:57.024
Hey, you got a problem?

04:59.010 --> 05:00.361
Go to hell.

05:02.064 --> 05:03.347
You want to know
something about yourself?

05:03.365 --> 05:05.867
I'll tell you
something about yourself.

05:05.901 --> 05:07.285
You got soft hands
and no muscle tone,

05:07.319 --> 05:09.237
which mark you for white-collar,

05:09.288 --> 05:10.905
but your eyes
have no spark of intelligence,

05:10.956 --> 05:14.208
and you obviously can't decipher
a simple sign, so guess what?

05:14.243 --> 05:16.160
You're not management.

05:16.194 --> 05:18.529
My guess is you're a drone.
You're a worker-bee.

05:18.547 --> 05:20.364
Top buttonhole's
pulled wide and frayed.

05:20.382 --> 05:21.632
You're fatter
than you used to be,

05:21.667 --> 05:22.867
and you can't afford
a new shirt.

05:22.885 --> 05:24.535
You're not even
a successful worker-bee.

05:24.553 --> 05:25.753
But maybe there's another reason

05:25.804 --> 05:27.805
that you can't afford
a new shirt. Huh?

05:29.425 --> 05:31.225
It's a girlfriend, yeah?

05:31.260 --> 05:33.010
- Hey...
- A mistress? Huh?

05:33.044 --> 05:35.680
But not just any mistress.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

05:35.714 --> 05:37.432
A mistress with a baby.

05:37.483 --> 05:39.550
Your baby. Your baby!

05:39.568 --> 05:41.235
Perhaps you know her, madam?

05:41.270 --> 05:42.737
She's got long blonde hair?

05:42.771 --> 05:44.388
You!

05:44.406 --> 05:45.990
You said you wouldn't
see her anymore!

05:46.024 --> 05:47.725
And now there's a baby?

05:47.743 --> 05:49.610
No, no. Bette!
Let me explain this!

05:49.661 --> 05:50.912
I think it's a boy.

05:50.946 --> 05:54.198
In pounds, I'd say your wife
is 140, 145?

05:54.232 --> 05:56.868
I'm not sure what that is
in kilos, but...

05:56.902 --> 05:58.703
You bastard!

06:00.155 --> 06:02.824
He is a bastard,
but you are not hitting him.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.126
Your wife is getting away.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.544
Go.

06:10.115 --> 06:11.749
You haven't lost your way
with people.

06:11.783 --> 06:14.886
It'd be a better world
without them, yes.

06:14.920 --> 06:18.222
How could you possibly figure
the mistress and the baby?

06:18.257 --> 06:21.509
Why are you at a carnival
in Amsterdam, Louis?

06:26.014 --> 06:29.767
That's what you're doing
with your skills, Carl?

06:29.801 --> 06:33.237
Why are you here?

06:33.272 --> 06:35.639
Do you have somewhere
private we can talk?

06:36.870 --> 06:38.538
Yeah.

06:48.337 --> 06:49.453
How many?

06:49.487 --> 06:50.922
Four.

06:50.956 --> 06:52.489
Including the one in Paris.

06:53.675 --> 06:55.676
A lot of cutting.

06:55.711 --> 06:58.129
He's a bad one.

06:59.664 --> 07:01.432
Carl, do you miss the job?

07:03.685 --> 07:05.686
Still haven't told me
why you're here, Louis.

07:08.607 --> 07:11.008
If you want to
feel like a cop again,

07:11.043 --> 07:14.695
I have a job for you.

07:30.803 --> 07:31.945

07:32.065 --> 07:33.431
Do war crimes and genocides?

07:33.551 --> 07:35.629
For now, we are going to
try something.

07:35.749 --> 07:36.934
"We"?

07:37.085 --> 07:40.254
I chose a team of cops
from all over the Eurozone.

07:40.272 --> 07:42.357
Each has a special skill.
Like you.

07:42.391 --> 07:44.142
I'm not a cop anymore.

07:44.193 --> 07:46.444
Then I won't have to
pay you much.

07:49.031 --> 07:51.566
Where are we goin'?

07:51.600 --> 07:52.867
If you're gonna shoot me,

07:52.901 --> 07:54.285
you could've done that
in Amsterdam.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.903
Hell, I'd have loaded the gun.

07:55.937 --> 07:57.104
Not with your hand.

07:57.122 --> 07:59.624
Good point.

07:59.658 --> 08:01.456
Can't grip anything
heavier than my joint

08:01.576 --> 08:02.793
without screaming.

08:02.828 --> 08:04.662
"Joint"?

08:04.713 --> 08:07.117
You know... Johnson.

08:07.672 --> 08:08.730
Pecker.

08:08.850 --> 08:09.619
Joint.

08:09.739 --> 08:12.086
Ah... "Braquemard."

08:12.620 --> 08:15.255
You French make everything
sound like a sauce.

08:16.975 --> 08:18.225
But you're still
able to function?

08:18.259 --> 08:21.094
Depends on
your definition of function.

08:21.128 --> 08:23.597
You're very lucky, you know?

08:23.631 --> 08:25.465
Lucky?

08:25.483 --> 08:27.934
That you were born
with a light "joint."

08:32.807 --> 08:34.274
Inspector Sienna Pride.

08:34.308 --> 08:36.076
Scotland Yard.

08:36.110 --> 08:37.410
Interrogation specialist.

08:38.863 --> 08:42.082
Investigator Sebastian Berger,
tech genius.

08:42.116 --> 08:45.285
Polizei Berlin, Germany.

08:45.319 --> 08:49.423
Eva Vittoria, sergeant,
anti-mafia.

08:49.457 --> 08:52.492
Undercover
and covert operations.

08:52.510 --> 08:55.379
Detective Tommy McConnell,

08:55.430 --> 08:58.382
Police Services
Northern Ireland,

08:58.433 --> 09:00.100
weapons and tactical expert.

09:00.134 --> 09:03.921
And Detective Sergeant
Anne-Marie San.

09:04.041 --> 09:07.441
Criminal analyst,
trafficking crimes specialist.

09:08.943 --> 09:11.511
Team, may I present...

09:11.529 --> 09:13.346
Detective First-Grade
Carlton Hickman.

09:13.381 --> 09:14.981
- You prefer "Carl."
- NYPD.

09:15.015 --> 09:17.034
<i>Former NYPD.</i>

09:17.068 --> 09:19.352
Led the department in arrests
six years running.

09:19.370 --> 09:21.187
In convictions, too.

09:21.205 --> 09:23.657
Four years as NYPD liaison

09:23.691 --> 09:25.042
in Europol after 9/11.

09:25.076 --> 09:27.327
Then back to New York,
where you led the department

09:27.361 --> 09:28.912
in arrests again.

09:28.963 --> 09:30.080
Until you were shot
in the hand.

09:30.131 --> 09:31.364
Chasing
a child abduction suspect.

09:31.382 --> 09:34.584
- Who got away.
- But you saved the child.

09:34.635 --> 09:37.213
Impressive use of Google.

09:38.065 --> 09:42.041
Well, here's one thing
I couldn't find on Google.

09:42.060 --> 09:44.261
If you're so bloody good,

09:44.312 --> 09:47.046
why'd the NYPD sack you?

09:48.766 --> 09:52.152
I'm only here because...

09:53.738 --> 09:55.221
Louis asked me to come...

09:55.239 --> 09:57.741
If I'm so bloody good...

10:01.228 --> 10:03.864
You can kiss my ass
in Macy's window.

10:07.285 --> 10:08.452
Macy's window?

10:08.503 --> 10:10.454
It's a shop in New York.

10:10.505 --> 10:12.005
You would know that.

10:12.039 --> 10:14.257
Well, it's not just in New York,
it's all over America.

10:14.292 --> 10:16.626
Why would his "ass"
be in the window?

10:16.677 --> 10:18.295
Waiting to be kissed
by Tommy McConnell.

10:23.551 --> 10:25.585
Carl, please.

10:27.021 --> 10:28.588
I don't need this.

10:28.606 --> 10:30.640
NYPD betrayed you.

10:30.691 --> 10:31.858
It's not fair.

10:31.893 --> 10:33.360
I don't see you

10:33.394 --> 10:36.530
ending up as a garbage man
in a carnival.

10:36.564 --> 10:38.148
I saw you today with that man.

10:38.199 --> 10:40.099
Your mind is sharp as ever.

10:40.118 --> 10:43.737
We have a chance
to stop a killer.

10:43.771 --> 10:45.071
A bad one.

10:45.105 --> 10:46.706
You don't want that?

10:46.741 --> 10:48.742
That's not what you need?

10:57.552 --> 10:59.336
I was sacked

10:59.387 --> 11:01.471
because my bosses were

11:01.506 --> 11:03.590
bastards
who stabbed me in the back.

11:03.624 --> 11:05.458
Also, I'm on
permanent heavy meds,

11:05.476 --> 11:07.894
and I have a useless right hand,

11:07.929 --> 11:10.630
the hand that I write
and shoot with,

11:10.648 --> 11:14.762
so I can't fill out a report
or hold a gun.

11:17.304 --> 11:19.523
Any other questions?

11:21.308 --> 11:22.526
Not right now.

11:22.577 --> 11:23.743
Good.

11:23.778 --> 11:25.245
So let's stop a monster

11:25.279 --> 11:27.146
before he kills another woman.

11:30.638 --> 11:34.753
So, the first victim was in Rome
seven months ago.

11:34.906 --> 11:37.040
A young girl in
Villa Borghese Park,

11:37.074 --> 11:38.241
in the woods.

11:38.292 --> 11:39.659
Same thing in Dublin,
three months later.

11:39.693 --> 11:40.877
Phoenix Park.

11:40.912 --> 11:42.412
London's Richmond Park,
one month ago.

11:42.463 --> 11:45.966
And, night before last,
Parc de Saint-Cloud in Paris.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.467
Each killed in a large park

11:47.501 --> 11:49.202
in a capital city.

11:49.220 --> 11:50.554
He's putting on a show.

11:50.588 --> 11:52.155
Tosser like this always is.

11:52.190 --> 11:53.640
Three months
between the first and second,

11:53.674 --> 11:55.392
three months
between the second and third,

11:55.426 --> 11:57.510
but now only one month
before the fourth.

11:57.544 --> 11:59.346
The time between victims
is getting shorter.

11:59.380 --> 12:01.648
Have any of the women
been identified?

12:01.682 --> 12:03.516
There is nothing
to identify them with.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.819
He did so much damage
to the faces and jaw lines,

12:05.853 --> 12:08.721
it's impossible to compare them
with photographs

12:08.739 --> 12:10.323
or dental records,

12:10.358 --> 12:12.075
and the fingerprints are gone.

12:12.109 --> 12:14.394
Ground off.
Like with sandpaper.

12:14.412 --> 12:16.229
He brings tools.

12:16.247 --> 12:20.250
None of the victims match
any open missing-persons report

12:20.284 --> 12:22.068
as far as height
and hair color.

12:22.086 --> 12:24.537
He also removes
clothing, jewellery,

12:24.571 --> 12:26.623
anything we can use
for secondary identification.

12:26.674 --> 12:28.741
He didn't just conceal
their identities,

12:28.759 --> 12:29.843
he erased them.

12:29.877 --> 12:31.711
He'll mess up.
They always do.

12:31.745 --> 12:33.930
Prostitutes
sometimes go missing.

12:33.965 --> 12:36.299
These women
don't look like, uh...

12:36.350 --> 12:37.917
They're not the street types.

12:37.935 --> 12:40.387
They seem healthy,
in relatively good shape.

12:40.421 --> 12:41.388
No signs of drug use.

12:41.422 --> 12:43.723
How can four
young girls be dead

12:43.757 --> 12:44.608
and no one is
looking for them?

12:44.642 --> 12:46.977
We've got nothing at all

12:47.028 --> 12:49.062
but four faceless,
nameless bodies.

12:49.096 --> 12:51.481
That's not necessarily true.

12:53.651 --> 12:55.619
Every fact has a reverse.

12:55.653 --> 12:58.238
Having no identifying
information means...

12:58.272 --> 12:59.823
Could mean...

12:59.874 --> 13:02.158
That he went to a lot of trouble
to keep them unidentified.

13:02.209 --> 13:04.777
Bastard...

13:04.795 --> 13:05.962
Why do that?

13:05.997 --> 13:08.832
If they were connected to him.

13:09.717 --> 13:11.451
If we I.D. them...

13:12.666 --> 13:15.088
It probably would lead
directly to him.

13:15.122 --> 13:16.456
So, job one,

13:16.474 --> 13:17.724
who are all these women?

13:17.758 --> 13:21.094
Sienna and Tommy,
go to the Paris morgue

13:21.128 --> 13:22.312
and follow up with the body.

13:22.346 --> 13:23.396
Straight away, sir.

13:23.431 --> 13:24.630
Anne-Marie, take Hickman

13:24.649 --> 13:26.966
to the Parc de Saint-Cloud
crime scene.

13:26.984 --> 13:29.352
Sebastian, go as well,
and use your new equipment.

13:29.403 --> 13:31.137
Very good, sir.

13:31.155 --> 13:32.238
We should be able
to join you all

13:32.273 --> 13:34.328
in Paris by nightfall.
All right?

13:40.481 --> 13:42.699
Got a ticket in my name?

13:42.750 --> 13:44.117
Pretty confident I'd join up.

13:45.169 --> 13:46.619
Eva, you're with me.

13:46.653 --> 13:48.672
Okay.

14:16.534 --> 14:18.184
How much of that do you take?

14:19.320 --> 14:21.321
I follow the directions.

14:21.355 --> 14:24.290
Can we trust
your brain on that?

14:24.325 --> 14:26.376
I probably wouldn't.

14:26.410 --> 14:27.794
Drink?

14:27.828 --> 14:28.795
No.

14:29.579 --> 14:33.082
Irishman refuses a drink.

14:33.116 --> 14:35.634
Alert the media.

14:35.669 --> 14:37.002
A cocky American.

14:37.053 --> 14:38.620
Who saw that coming?

14:40.474 --> 14:42.092
Whiskey?

14:42.143 --> 14:43.727
Six Euros.

14:46.180 --> 14:47.847
How much did you win
in your last fight?

14:49.550 --> 14:52.852
Or was it just a feud thing?

14:56.574 --> 14:58.441
This your way of impressing me?

14:58.492 --> 15:00.226
You reckon I'll go all chilly

15:00.244 --> 15:03.029
'cause you deduced
I bare-knuckle fight?

15:06.283 --> 15:08.251
Broken 51 times,

15:08.285 --> 15:09.536
grew back wanky.

15:09.570 --> 15:11.204
Anyone can see it.

15:11.238 --> 15:12.872
Not too many ways that happens,

15:12.906 --> 15:14.340
past punching things
without gloves on.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.742
My less-than-posh
Irish background

15:16.761 --> 15:18.795
points to bare-knuckle
clan fighting,

15:18.846 --> 15:22.182
and my still-pretty face
says I usually win.

15:24.418 --> 15:28.921
You're no smarter than me,
super-detective.

15:28.939 --> 15:31.357
You're an angry guy, Tommy.

15:32.893 --> 15:35.111
That's gonna get in your way.

15:35.146 --> 15:37.363
You saying you're not angry?

15:38.566 --> 15:40.150
I'm saying

15:40.201 --> 15:43.069
the last person in the world
you want to end up like is me.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.733
All right.

16:00.206 --> 16:03.125
Sergeant Vittoria
of the N.O.C.S. in Rome.

16:03.159 --> 16:04.426
This is...

16:04.461 --> 16:07.212
Mikael Lechnya Dorn.

16:07.263 --> 16:08.430
I'm honored, sir.

16:08.465 --> 16:10.165
I know of your work

16:10.183 --> 16:11.967
with the International
Criminal Court.

16:12.001 --> 16:14.019
"Sir?"

16:14.054 --> 16:16.772
I'm Dorn. Just Dorn.

16:18.641 --> 16:20.609
They refused
to sanction your team.

16:20.643 --> 16:21.777
What?

16:21.811 --> 16:23.112
I warned you, Louis.

16:23.146 --> 16:25.531
My hands are pretty much tied.

16:25.565 --> 16:28.350
They're very cautious,
those men in there.

16:28.368 --> 16:29.485
They don't seek

16:29.519 --> 16:31.987
fame, money, ambition.

16:32.021 --> 16:33.856
They're incorruptible,

16:33.890 --> 16:35.124
which means it's
very difficult

16:35.158 --> 16:36.691
to make a deal with them.

16:36.710 --> 16:38.744
Did they give
a reason for refusal?

16:38.795 --> 16:40.462
Yeah. They're concerned
that they would be,

16:40.497 --> 16:43.582
or would appear to be,
usurping the power

16:43.633 --> 16:45.000
of sovereign states.

16:45.034 --> 16:46.535
I'm not asking for power,
I just want to do my job.

16:46.553 --> 16:48.754
Well...

16:48.805 --> 16:52.174
You're going to have to find
another way to do your job.

16:52.208 --> 16:53.559
I don't understand.

16:53.593 --> 16:56.228
The workings of the court
are very complicated...

16:56.262 --> 16:57.679
Not them.

16:57.713 --> 16:58.847
You.

16:59.766 --> 17:02.684
I don't understand you.

17:02.718 --> 17:04.987
I beg your pardon?

17:06.071 --> 17:08.935
I read something
you wrote once,

17:09.056 --> 17:11.781
in a report on Kosovo.

17:12.452 --> 17:16.753
"The mothers and wives
of missing Serbs

17:16.874 --> 17:19.328
are begging for
their loved ones to be found,

17:19.448 --> 17:21.231
but they never will be.

17:22.672 --> 17:23.622
This court is..."

17:23.673 --> 17:26.208
"Is the only place
for them to turn.

17:26.242 --> 17:28.910
We weep

17:28.928 --> 17:31.213
for those
no one else weeps for."

17:32.766 --> 17:35.784
Exactly.

17:37.470 --> 17:40.606
Four women have been butchered
by the same man

17:40.640 --> 17:42.808
in four different countries.

17:42.859 --> 17:44.810
That man will never be caught

17:44.861 --> 17:46.195
because the authorities in Rome

17:46.229 --> 17:48.530
don't talk to Dublin,
who don't talk to Paris,

17:48.565 --> 17:50.616
who don't talk to London.

17:50.650 --> 17:52.734
I mean,
I-it's not their fault,

17:52.768 --> 17:55.037
but that's the way it worked

17:55.071 --> 17:58.073
until Major Daniel
brought us together.

17:59.309 --> 18:01.660
Maybe one day,
we won't need it,

18:01.711 --> 18:03.162
but right now,

18:03.213 --> 18:05.881
this court is the only place

18:05.915 --> 18:07.800
for these women to turn.

18:07.834 --> 18:11.503
No one else weeps for them.

18:11.554 --> 18:13.889
No one.

18:15.892 --> 18:18.010
We're adjourned.

18:18.061 --> 18:20.229
It's a crime of aggression

18:20.263 --> 18:23.465
that is ongoing, systematic
and cross-border.

18:23.483 --> 18:26.235
This is exactly
what the I.C.C. does.

18:28.822 --> 18:31.740
Sorry.

18:31.774 --> 18:34.026
No. It's fine.

18:35.144 --> 18:39.998
What man doesn't like a woman
to tell him how brilliant he is?

18:41.918 --> 18:44.002
Get ready to travel.

18:44.037 --> 18:45.671
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.468
I.C.C. team
from The Hague?

18:59.502 --> 19:00.936
<i>- Ca va?</i>
<i>- Ca va.</i>

19:00.970 --> 19:02.771
Major Daniel said
two cars would be sufficient.

19:02.805 --> 19:03.772
<i>C'est les deux-la.</i>

19:03.806 --> 19:05.023
- Okay.
<i>- D'accord.</i>

19:05.058 --> 19:06.508
- Merci, Detective Moreau.
<i>- Avec plaisir.</i>

19:06.526 --> 19:07.643
That's service.

19:07.677 --> 19:08.694
I.C.C. team?

19:08.728 --> 19:09.862
I didn't know we had a name.

19:09.896 --> 19:11.647
It's like we're
the Justice League

19:11.681 --> 19:13.899
or something.

19:13.950 --> 19:14.950
"Justice League?"

19:14.984 --> 19:16.235
It's an American comic book

19:16.286 --> 19:17.703
about a team
of super-heroes.

19:17.737 --> 19:18.954
How do you lot not know that?

19:18.988 --> 19:20.539
What did you read
when you were kids?

19:20.573 --> 19:21.874
- Biographies.
- Encyclopedias.

19:21.908 --> 19:23.375
Things with
grown-up words.

19:23.409 --> 19:25.494
Guess I didn't get
the same books

19:25.528 --> 19:27.412
as you Cheltenham
Girls' School lot.

19:27.463 --> 19:28.797
Cheltenham "ladies," actually.

19:28.831 --> 19:29.798
All right, ladies, is it?

19:29.832 --> 19:31.083
We'll see you
at the crime scene.

19:31.134 --> 19:32.885
Tommy!

19:32.919 --> 19:34.503
Hey, I drive.

19:34.537 --> 19:35.804
Oh, grow up.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.603
Ah, stay, stay, stay.

19:52.355 --> 19:55.541
The magistrate is
writing up an order,

19:55.576 --> 19:57.994
authorizing you to investigate

19:58.028 --> 19:59.194
this crime series.

19:59.213 --> 19:59.996
This series only.

20:00.030 --> 20:01.380
Thank you, Dorn.

20:01.415 --> 20:03.348
Thank Sergeant Vittoria.

20:04.835 --> 20:07.420
It's always the same.

20:07.471 --> 20:09.889
A woman's mind is...

20:09.923 --> 20:13.376
quite extraordinary.

20:13.410 --> 20:15.544
Here.

20:17.847 --> 20:20.298
You are doing this
for the right reasons,

20:20.316 --> 20:21.516
aren't you, Louis?

20:22.652 --> 20:24.969
This is about the women,
about the job, yes?

20:24.988 --> 20:27.489
You are not using everyone

20:27.523 --> 20:29.358
to further another end,
are you?

20:29.409 --> 20:31.810
What do you want me to say?

20:31.828 --> 20:33.996
The truth.

20:34.030 --> 20:36.147
I don't know.

20:41.587 --> 20:43.789
How is Rebecca?

20:43.823 --> 20:46.341
The same.

20:46.376 --> 20:47.992
Thank you.

20:50.046 --> 20:52.097
Your order.

20:54.183 --> 20:56.301
Be wary, my friend.

20:56.335 --> 20:58.887
"Those to whom
evil is done..."

21:00.390 --> 21:03.275
"...do evil
in return."

21:03.309 --> 21:04.476
You quote Auden to me?

21:07.196 --> 21:09.981
Serves you right.
You gave him to me.

21:10.015 --> 21:11.283
Yeah.

21:11.317 --> 21:15.037
It also says
"We must love each other..."

21:15.071 --> 21:17.239
"...Or die."

21:17.290 --> 21:18.824
I can assure you

21:18.858 --> 21:22.077
that those
conventional authorities

21:22.128 --> 21:23.829
in those countries

21:23.863 --> 21:25.997
will not love you.

21:26.031 --> 21:27.382
Probably not.

21:28.634 --> 21:30.669
Thank you.

22:05.755 --> 22:06.738
Afternoon, detective.

22:06.756 --> 22:08.540
Bonjour, Officer Laffont.

22:08.574 --> 22:09.424
This is Detective Hickman.

22:12.912 --> 22:14.379
Are the neighbours
giving you a hard time?

22:14.413 --> 22:16.247
I can't really blame them.

22:16.265 --> 22:17.549
They just want to
use their park.

22:17.583 --> 22:19.301
Yeah. We'll try to
finish up by today, okay.

22:19.352 --> 22:20.635
Is it true, ma'am?

22:20.686 --> 22:22.354
Commissaire Laveaux
of the crime squad

22:22.388 --> 22:24.473
is calling him another ripper,
like the one in London.

22:24.524 --> 22:25.891
There's a difference.

22:25.925 --> 22:27.592
This one's gonna be caught.

22:27.610 --> 22:31.113
Merci. Shall we?

22:39.428 --> 22:41.277
Is that a Compass Rose?

22:42.139 --> 22:44.024
Mind your business.

22:44.075 --> 22:46.192
Oh, it's something
you want to hide?

22:47.445 --> 22:51.081
Why get a tattoo
you need to hide?

22:51.115 --> 22:53.116
You interrogating me?

22:56.787 --> 22:58.872
I'm ready.

23:00.508 --> 23:03.760
We'll finish this.
Later.

23:03.794 --> 23:05.879
No. We won't.

23:05.930 --> 23:09.665
Do you really think
we'll catch this ripper?

23:09.684 --> 23:11.434
Don't call him that.

23:11.469 --> 23:13.336
Jack the ripper
killed five women

23:13.354 --> 23:15.188
in five completely
different locations.

23:15.222 --> 23:19.275
Every scene was more brutal
than the last.

23:20.478 --> 23:23.897
He took prizes, body parts.

23:23.948 --> 23:25.315
Everything for him
was post-kill.

23:25.349 --> 23:26.983
This guy

23:27.017 --> 23:29.736
does the same thing every time,
in the same type of place.

23:29.787 --> 23:33.289
He seems to have
some sort of ritual

23:33.324 --> 23:35.447
that plays out
before the murder.

23:35.567 --> 23:36.571
Everything after

23:36.691 --> 23:38.456
is to conceal the crime.

23:38.576 --> 23:41.831
They couldn't be
more different.

23:42.601 --> 23:43.634
Any idea how he got her here?

23:43.652 --> 23:46.187
No vehicle tracks,
if that's what you mean.

23:46.238 --> 23:48.879
That's what I mean.
Footprints?

23:48.999 --> 23:50.780
This park
is very well-travelled.

23:50.900 --> 23:53.232
We even tried focusing
on only the barefoot prints,

23:53.352 --> 23:54.694
but there are just too many.

23:55.530 --> 23:57.648
What's that?

23:57.666 --> 24:01.452
It's a variation on
a virtual autopsy device.

24:01.486 --> 24:04.288
It uses
light-amplification beams

24:04.322 --> 24:07.091
to scan a scene
thousands of times

24:07.125 --> 24:09.793
so we can recreate it
later, holographically.

24:09.827 --> 24:11.929
I call it "Scangen,"

24:11.963 --> 24:14.665
because it, well,
it generates scans.

24:26.645 --> 24:28.812
This guy is very short.

24:28.846 --> 24:30.648
Maybe 5'5", at the most.

24:30.682 --> 24:31.699
How do you know that?

24:33.118 --> 24:35.286
See the blood splatter
from the knife

24:35.320 --> 24:37.354
on the bottom of the leaves?

24:37.372 --> 24:39.356
Yeah?

24:40.525 --> 24:43.694
That's the upstroke.
Goes way up there, right?

24:43.712 --> 24:45.379
But now look at
the tops of the leaves.

24:46.864 --> 24:48.749
The splatter
from the downstroke

24:48.800 --> 24:50.384
is at six-feet or below.

24:50.418 --> 24:52.369
A man with his arm
raised above head

24:52.387 --> 24:54.421
usually picks up the length of
his lower arm in height.

24:54.472 --> 24:55.472
My height...

24:55.507 --> 24:57.558
His height.

24:59.811 --> 25:02.263
Now, what does this new fact
tell you that you didn't know?

25:02.314 --> 25:04.014
Small feet.

25:04.048 --> 25:05.566
Small feet. Yeah.

25:15.026 --> 25:16.660
<i>Hello.</i>

25:16.695 --> 25:17.728
<i>This is the Daniel family.</i>

25:17.746 --> 25:20.414
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

25:21.566 --> 25:24.234
<i>Rebecca, it's me again.</i>

25:24.252 --> 25:26.236
<i>Please...</i>

25:26.254 --> 25:28.589
<i>I just want to talk.</i>

25:35.396 --> 25:36.396
Are you ready, sir?

25:36.430 --> 25:38.431
Yes. I'm ready.

25:42.854 --> 25:44.438
Scanning.

25:51.730 --> 25:53.197
Two sets going north.

25:53.231 --> 25:54.331
One barefoot...

25:54.366 --> 25:56.033
One wearing small boots
or work shoes.

25:56.067 --> 25:56.951
The strides are fairly long.

25:56.985 --> 25:57.934
They were running.

25:57.953 --> 25:59.787
Well, he was chasing her.

25:59.821 --> 26:02.156
Then, just this set
of small tracks

26:02.207 --> 26:03.657
goes back South.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.244
Hickman.

26:07.278 --> 26:09.279
Look. There's blood, too.

26:09.297 --> 26:14.301
She was already bleeding
when he was chasing her?

26:14.336 --> 26:15.836
Maybe he attacked her
somewhere else, and she escaped.

26:15.887 --> 26:18.055
A secondary crime scene
would be valuable.

26:20.225 --> 26:22.092
Oh, hold on. Look. Look.

26:23.127 --> 26:24.461
Yeah.

26:24.479 --> 26:26.630
Why do his return tracks
criss-cross like that?

26:26.648 --> 26:28.965
Looks like he was lost
after he killed her.

26:28.984 --> 26:29.767
Or looking for something.

26:29.801 --> 26:31.318
Something important enough

26:31.353 --> 26:33.570
to take the chance of being
discovered with a dead body

26:33.605 --> 26:35.072
in the clearing.

26:35.106 --> 26:36.490
Important enough to look for,
instead of escaping.

26:36.524 --> 26:37.691
Evidence.

26:37.742 --> 26:39.994
<i>There are multiple</i>
<i>deep lacerations</i>

26:40.028 --> 26:42.112
from a large bladed weapon, ,,

26:42.146 --> 26:44.114
was she dead
when her face was damaged?

26:44.148 --> 26:45.816
Oh, probably.

26:45.834 --> 26:47.668
The angle of those wounds
indicate she was already prone.

26:47.702 --> 26:49.420
Looks very angry.

26:49.454 --> 26:50.821
But also methodical.

26:50.839 --> 26:52.039
At key points,

26:52.090 --> 26:53.791
there are shallow
puncture wounds...

26:53.825 --> 26:56.794
At the wrist,
in her inner thighs...

26:56.828 --> 26:57.878
On arteries.

26:57.929 --> 26:59.797
He cut her wrists?

26:59.831 --> 27:01.215
Ah, he punctured them.

27:01.266 --> 27:03.384
She bled, but not quickly.

27:03.435 --> 27:05.519
It would be a...
A steady ooze.

27:05.553 --> 27:08.138
And these appear to have been
the first wounds made.

27:08.172 --> 27:10.691
Why would he do that?

27:10.725 --> 27:12.726
To weaken her.

27:13.728 --> 27:15.562
Like a jab for a fighter.

27:15.613 --> 27:16.947
Bloody him up first

27:16.981 --> 27:19.516
before you get in close
and finish him off.

27:22.487 --> 27:24.071
Excuse me.

27:26.958 --> 27:29.660
How long have you been
a detective in Paris?

27:29.694 --> 27:31.545
I'm not.

27:31.579 --> 27:33.797
I work mainly

27:33.832 --> 27:36.467
on border crimes
out of offices in Lyon.

27:36.501 --> 27:38.752
It was Major Daniel
who brought me here.

27:38.803 --> 27:40.554
Really?

27:40.588 --> 27:41.889
That surprises you?

27:41.923 --> 27:43.307
We've talked

27:43.341 --> 27:45.142
to two Parisian police officers
since we arrived,

27:45.176 --> 27:46.543
neither of them had nametags,

27:46.561 --> 27:48.429
yet you called them both
by name.

27:48.480 --> 27:51.482
Oh, that's...
that's something I have.

27:51.516 --> 27:53.267
I remember.

27:53.318 --> 27:55.239
You're eidetic?

27:57.238 --> 27:59.723
My doctors call it
hyperthymesia.

27:59.741 --> 28:00.991
Doctors?

28:01.025 --> 28:02.493
Yeah. My mother's a physician.

28:02.527 --> 28:03.610
Oh.

28:03.661 --> 28:04.828
When I was a child,

28:04.863 --> 28:07.030
she thought
I might be autistic,

28:07.064 --> 28:08.899
so she had an MRI
done of my brain,

28:08.917 --> 28:10.417
and they found
an enlarged temporal lobe

28:10.452 --> 28:11.535
and Caudate Nucleus.

28:12.670 --> 28:13.737
That's a mouthful.

28:13.755 --> 28:17.240
It's found in people
with O.C.D.

28:18.259 --> 28:19.376
Sorry.

28:20.712 --> 28:22.379
Anne-Marie San.

28:24.015 --> 28:27.029
That would make sense
with what we're finding here.

28:27.149 --> 28:28.751
Yeah. We're here.

28:29.853 --> 28:30.835
That was Sienna.

28:30.870 --> 28:32.003
The coroner says

28:32.037 --> 28:33.338
he might have
wounded her first.

28:33.372 --> 28:34.873
Some arteries were nicked.

28:34.907 --> 28:37.959
Started her bleeding,
and then...

28:38.010 --> 28:39.544
Then let her run.

28:39.578 --> 28:40.712
Son of a bitch hunted her.

28:42.013 --> 28:43.798
He's a sadist.

28:43.849 --> 28:47.585
She was dead
the moment she showed him fear.

28:48.687 --> 28:50.054
Is there something else?

28:50.088 --> 28:52.089
It's just a bit odd

28:52.108 --> 28:54.726
for a sadist to put on a show
like this.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.111
They're usually...

28:56.145 --> 28:58.707
Usually a bit more...

28:58.827 --> 29:00.356
Private.

29:05.405 --> 29:06.205
Look.

29:06.239 --> 29:10.159
She had one shoe on...

29:10.193 --> 29:12.077
When she got to this root,

29:12.128 --> 29:13.779
and then she was barefoot.

29:16.132 --> 29:16.999
She lost a shoe.

29:20.253 --> 29:21.203
Look at her tracks.

29:21.221 --> 29:22.254
He found it.

29:22.305 --> 29:23.371
He was looking for her shoes?

29:23.390 --> 29:27.542
He found one,
maybe not the other.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.678
Just needed some water.

29:32.599 --> 29:36.318
It's not the blood
or the damage,

29:36.352 --> 29:38.187
it's the smell in
these places, you know?

29:38.221 --> 29:40.555
You never hear of
olfactory fatigue?

29:42.108 --> 29:44.943
Take a couple of deep breaths.
You won't notice it soon enough.

29:44.994 --> 29:47.863
I'm saying
the smell bothers me,

29:47.897 --> 29:49.114
you're saying
suck up more of it?

29:49.165 --> 29:50.282
It works.

29:51.901 --> 29:52.951
What, growing up
in Traveller Camps,

29:53.002 --> 29:54.036
you never got used to
bad smells?

29:54.070 --> 29:55.737
I mean, that's
the tattoo, right?

29:55.755 --> 29:56.955
The compass rose?

29:57.006 --> 29:58.123
You're an Irish Traveller.
Your family are criminals.

29:58.174 --> 29:59.958
Wow.

29:59.993 --> 30:01.376
We're showing
our true colours now,

30:01.410 --> 30:02.428
aren't we?

30:03.546 --> 30:05.047
Inspector Pride.

30:24.784 --> 30:27.536
What have you done?

30:27.570 --> 30:29.872
What have you done?

30:37.780 --> 30:39.715
<i>Major Daniel?</i>

30:40.383 --> 30:41.449
Major Daniel?

30:41.468 --> 30:42.634
You okay?

30:44.637 --> 30:46.221
Y-yeah.

30:46.256 --> 30:47.122
Yeah.

30:47.140 --> 30:48.557
You sure?

30:48.591 --> 30:51.009
Yes, I'm fine now.

30:51.060 --> 30:53.645
Okay.

30:54.481 --> 30:56.815
She had on both shoes here.

30:56.850 --> 30:58.633
Look.

30:58.651 --> 31:00.135
One shoe here.

31:01.804 --> 31:04.189
Okay... okay... this... this...

31:04.240 --> 31:04.940
Search...

31:04.974 --> 31:06.158
Ah!

31:06.192 --> 31:07.109
Hickman! Are you okay?

31:07.143 --> 31:08.911
Oh!

31:08.945 --> 31:10.312
I'm fine.

31:10.330 --> 31:11.530
Let's just look.

31:13.983 --> 31:17.002
It's okay! It's okay.
I'll... I'll do it.

31:23.326 --> 31:25.544
Oh, wait.

31:39.192 --> 31:40.508
It says, uh...

31:40.527 --> 31:42.227
"C. G."

31:42.278 --> 31:43.612
That's "Charles Gallant."

31:43.646 --> 31:46.348
A pair of shoes costs
more than 1,500 pounds.

31:46.366 --> 31:48.400
That's almost 2,000 Euros.

31:48.451 --> 31:51.236
If she is a pro,
she's a good one.

31:53.664 --> 31:56.528
First piece of actual evidence
he's left behind.

31:56.538 --> 31:57.922
Hard to believe we're
looking at wealthy victims.

31:57.973 --> 32:00.058
- Who no one's looking for?
- Exactly.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.876
And yet, it's odd.

32:03.095 --> 32:05.230
It's actually a very old style.

32:05.264 --> 32:06.648
Inspector Pride has
a fashion criticism

32:06.682 --> 32:08.049
for the victim.

32:08.067 --> 32:09.601
- What do you mean by "old"?
- It looks vintage.

32:09.652 --> 32:11.603
It's unusual
for Charles Gallant.

32:11.654 --> 32:14.272
Do you think
he sells a lot of these?

32:14.323 --> 32:16.441
I don't know many people
who can afford them.

32:16.492 --> 32:18.326
Don't.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.611
If I sold shoes like these,

32:19.662 --> 32:21.162
I'd want to keep track
of who bought them,

32:21.197 --> 32:22.396
so I could sell them more.

32:22.415 --> 32:24.115
Which means a database.

32:24.166 --> 32:25.450
The main dealer's
here in Paris.

32:26.786 --> 32:27.902
I'll make a call.

32:31.207 --> 32:32.957
Allo, bonjour,
this is Detective San.

32:33.008 --> 32:35.043
Do you keep a record
of your clients?

32:35.077 --> 32:37.796
Can we come and see you? Now?

32:37.847 --> 32:40.014
Thank you.
We'll be right there.

32:42.184 --> 32:44.469
So, not only do they keep track
of their customer base,

32:44.520 --> 32:45.920
but the shoes are handmade.

32:45.938 --> 32:47.972
There's a serial number
in the sole of each shoe

32:48.023 --> 32:49.474
that corresponds
to the customer.

32:49.525 --> 32:50.725
Which means a name.

32:50.759 --> 32:51.976
Yeah. The store's
about to close,

32:52.027 --> 32:53.594
but the manager's
waiting for us.

32:53.612 --> 32:55.947
Let's go.

32:55.981 --> 32:59.651
You three wait for Louis
at the crime scene. We'll go.

33:04.940 --> 33:09.160
Eva, I want to apologize
for what happened on the train.

33:09.211 --> 33:12.464
No good cop
can sleep well, sir.

33:13.499 --> 33:14.415
Yeah. Major Daniel.

33:14.449 --> 33:16.968
Hey. Well,
it's like I said, Louis.

33:17.002 --> 33:20.138
They're not happy
with your change in assignment.

33:20.172 --> 33:21.973
The French are up in arms.

33:22.007 --> 33:23.258
Which French?

33:23.292 --> 33:24.142
36.

33:24.176 --> 33:26.678
Laveaux. Thank you, Dorn.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.797
Can you go faster, please?

33:29.815 --> 33:31.900
Is there something wrong?

33:31.934 --> 33:33.318
36 is angry.

33:33.352 --> 33:34.936
Who's 36?

33:34.970 --> 33:37.105
The Direction Regionale
de Police Judiciaire de Paris.

33:37.139 --> 33:39.023
We call it "36"

33:39.074 --> 33:40.808
because of their
headquarters' address,

33:40.826 --> 33:42.193
and they are very territorial.

33:42.244 --> 33:43.828
We have authorization, though.

33:43.863 --> 33:45.196
We do.

33:45.247 --> 33:48.249
But the team doesn't,
and they are in the park.

33:48.284 --> 33:50.118
What's going on?

33:50.152 --> 33:52.253
A young boy found
a dead dog up there.

33:52.288 --> 33:53.755
Oh?

33:53.789 --> 33:55.673
What sort of dog was it?

33:55.708 --> 33:57.292
Anne-Marie?

33:57.326 --> 33:58.492
Uh, sorry.

33:58.511 --> 34:00.712
We're almost done here.
Merci beaucoup.

34:14.527 --> 34:16.610
So this entire crime scene
can be reproduced now?

34:16.645 --> 34:18.279
In holographic form.

34:18.313 --> 34:19.614
That's unbelievable.

34:19.648 --> 34:22.350
We first used it
on a case in Sittensen,

34:22.368 --> 34:23.684
near Hamburg.

34:23.702 --> 34:26.036
Asian triads killed
a number of civilians

34:26.071 --> 34:27.989
in a Chinese restaurant,
a massacre.

34:28.023 --> 34:29.523
We were able to show the jury

34:29.542 --> 34:31.743
exactly where each of
the shooters had been standing,

34:31.793 --> 34:32.877
and who they actually killed.

34:32.911 --> 34:34.746
- That's an impressive toy.
- Yeah.

34:34.797 --> 34:36.164
We could even use it
to find any evidence

34:36.197 --> 34:37.715
missed the first time.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.300
Are you saying
we missed something?

34:39.335 --> 34:40.301
No, I meant...

34:40.335 --> 34:41.302
Who are you all?

34:41.337 --> 34:42.587
We're police officers with...

34:42.638 --> 34:44.755
- We're investigating a mur...
- Investigating?

34:44.806 --> 34:47.507
What the hell are three
foreign officers doing

34:47.542 --> 34:48.592
inside a Parisian crime scene?

34:48.643 --> 34:49.877
Well, it's kind of
hard to explain,

34:49.895 --> 34:51.228
but Major Daniel
will be on his way to...

34:51.263 --> 34:54.065
Good. He can come collect you
at headquarters.

34:54.099 --> 34:56.217
What?

34:56.235 --> 34:58.019
Will handcuffs be necessary?

35:15.838 --> 35:17.405
We're here.

35:17.423 --> 35:19.090
Go ahead in.
I need a minute.

35:20.593 --> 35:21.575
Alone.

35:21.594 --> 35:23.261
Okay.

35:23.295 --> 35:25.579
Probably take 'em a few minutes
to look it up, anyway.

35:25.598 --> 35:27.748
I just...
I just need a minute.

35:27.766 --> 35:29.917
No trouble.
Take your time.

36:00.049 --> 36:01.049
Hello?

36:01.083 --> 36:03.167
Anne-Marie?

36:06.722 --> 36:09.790
Anybody here?

36:26.075 --> 36:28.326
Ah!

36:30.112 --> 36:32.980
Anne-Marie!

36:35.951 --> 36:37.001
Anne-Marie!

36:37.036 --> 36:39.921
Anne-Marie!

36:44.547 --> 36:46.686
<i>Where's my phone?</i>

36:47.675 --> 36:50.175
Where's my phone?

36:52.146 --> 36:55.131
Come on! Come on!

36:57.184 --> 36:58.018
No!

36:59.854 --> 37:02.522
Paris emergency!

37:02.573 --> 37:04.157
Paris emergency...

37:04.191 --> 37:07.477
17! 17... 17.

37:07.495 --> 37:09.663
Keep it quiet.

37:10.814 --> 37:12.565
- Are these their phones?
- Yes, sir.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.150
Copy their contact names.

37:14.168 --> 37:15.268
How do you turn it on?

37:15.303 --> 37:16.670
I'd really rather you didn't.

37:16.704 --> 37:19.005
I didn't mean
Traveller Camps smell.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.006
Idiot.

37:20.041 --> 37:22.158
I only meant that
you living like that,

37:22.176 --> 37:24.327
living in a camp with
a lot of other families,

37:24.345 --> 37:25.879
you must've...

37:25.930 --> 37:27.180
Come across

37:27.214 --> 37:29.532
bad smells.

37:29.567 --> 37:31.468
Is this an apology?

37:31.502 --> 37:33.836
It's meant to be.

37:36.590 --> 37:37.674
You're an only child, right?

37:37.708 --> 37:40.126
Parents like yours,

37:40.161 --> 37:41.895
a solicitor and an MP,

37:41.946 --> 37:43.713
they don't go in
for a mess of kids.

37:43.748 --> 37:45.448
What's your point?

37:45.483 --> 37:46.900
You're a cliche.

37:46.951 --> 37:50.186
I'm proud I grew up Pavee.

37:50.204 --> 37:53.323
Four brothers and three sisters,

37:53.357 --> 37:55.075
and we didn't have Jack...

37:56.844 --> 37:58.912
But we had a family.

37:58.963 --> 38:02.382
No!
Don't press that button!

38:02.416 --> 38:03.866
I haven't downloaded
the images from the park yet.

38:03.884 --> 38:06.469
Images?
From my crime scene?

38:06.504 --> 38:07.504
Your crime scene?

38:07.538 --> 38:09.205
- Tommy.
- His crime scene?

38:09.223 --> 38:11.307
They missed the wounds
on the wrists and thighs...

38:11.342 --> 38:14.561
What? They missed
the blood spatters in the trees,

38:14.595 --> 38:15.929
and they missed the shoe!

38:15.980 --> 38:18.064
- Shoe?
- Major Daniel can explain.

38:18.099 --> 38:19.215
Major Daniel?

38:19.233 --> 38:21.184
He was supposed to keep me
informed. He didn't.

38:21.218 --> 38:22.435
You have every right
to be angry.

38:22.486 --> 38:25.572
I am deeply sorry
we've offended you.

38:25.606 --> 38:26.740
We should've asked
your permission

38:26.774 --> 38:28.525
before we entered
your jurisdiction,

38:28.559 --> 38:30.360
but it was an oversight,

38:30.394 --> 38:32.195
not an intentional slight.

38:33.781 --> 38:35.031
What shoe?

38:38.068 --> 38:40.537
If you removed evidence
from a crime scene,

38:40.571 --> 38:43.072
I'll have you all brought up
in front of a judge.

38:43.090 --> 38:44.257
You went through us

38:44.291 --> 38:45.908
like we was virgins
on our wedding night.

38:45.926 --> 38:47.744
Didja find any evidence?

38:47.762 --> 38:50.213
You put them in the cage?

38:50.247 --> 38:51.681
These foreigners
were trespassing.

38:51.716 --> 38:52.966
This is an order
from the I.C.C.,

38:53.017 --> 38:55.084
directing my team

38:55.102 --> 38:57.854
to investigate
a series of murders.

38:57.888 --> 38:59.105
So, now, Laveaux,

38:59.140 --> 39:00.974
you are interfering
in my investigation.

39:01.025 --> 39:02.192
Right?

39:02.226 --> 39:03.143
Open it.

39:03.194 --> 39:05.094
Hi, guys.

39:05.112 --> 39:07.430
I brought
identification and guns.

39:07.448 --> 39:08.097
There you go.

39:08.115 --> 39:09.282
Ah.

39:09.316 --> 39:10.433
Welcome home, girls.

39:10.451 --> 39:12.101
Talking of cliches.

39:12.119 --> 39:13.603
- Commissaire Laveaux?
- What?

39:13.621 --> 39:15.938
An American is reporting
a murdered man in a shoe store

39:15.956 --> 39:17.273
and an officer missing.

39:18.375 --> 39:19.776
- What shoe store?
- Charles Gallant.

39:24.782 --> 39:26.833
Hickman...

39:26.884 --> 39:27.917
Are you okay?

39:27.951 --> 39:32.555
You shouldn't have
brought me here, Louis.

39:32.590 --> 39:34.624
I wasn't...

39:34.642 --> 39:36.509
I'm not...
I'm not ready.

39:36.560 --> 39:38.511
I'm not <i>right.</i>

39:38.562 --> 39:39.512
What do you mean,
you're "not right"?

39:39.563 --> 39:41.481
The drugs, my head... I'm not...

39:41.515 --> 39:44.067
I'm not thinking clearly,
anymore!

39:44.101 --> 39:45.802
There's nothing wrong
with your head.

39:45.820 --> 39:47.187
Carl, listen to me.

39:47.238 --> 39:48.488
I was watching you,

39:48.522 --> 39:50.106
when you read that man
at the carnival.

39:50.140 --> 39:52.242
You even knew about
the mistress and the baby!

39:52.276 --> 39:54.160
I saw him! Okay?

39:54.195 --> 39:55.812
I saw him.
The day before.

39:55.830 --> 39:58.031
He was at the carnival with
the girl, with the girlfriend.

39:58.082 --> 39:59.649
And the baby!

39:59.667 --> 40:01.034
There was no reading involved,
there was no...

40:01.085 --> 40:02.752
no deduction or nothin'.

40:02.787 --> 40:07.323
I just... I saw him.

40:07.341 --> 40:09.826
I saw him.

40:18.385 --> 40:20.970
This is not your fault.

40:28.679 --> 40:33.683
I let her come in alone.

40:33.701 --> 40:37.687
I stayed in the car
for a few minutes.

40:37.705 --> 40:41.541
Because I had to do something.

40:41.575 --> 40:42.692
I let her come in alone.

40:44.962 --> 40:46.663
We have roadblocks

40:46.697 --> 40:49.031
on every major road
leaving Paris.

40:51.201 --> 40:54.637
We'll find her.

41:28.839 --> 41:33.209
Diplomatic plates.
U.S. Embassy.

41:34.962 --> 41:36.763
Let him through.

41:36.797 --> 41:40.200
Okay, this way.
This way. Move on.

41:54.882 --> 41:56.504
<i>I never should have done this.</i>

41:56.624 --> 41:58.027
<i>I wasn't ready.</i>

42:03.089 --> 42:05.424
<i>I let her go in by herself.</i>

42:07.393 --> 42:09.978
<i>I left her alone.</i>

42:10.013 --> 42:12.347
<i>I never should have done this.</i>

42:12.398 --> 42:15.300
<i>I never</i>
<i>should have done this...</i>

42:18.271 --> 42:22.474
There she is.

42:39.342 --> 42:42.044
<i>Bastardo.</i>

42:42.095 --> 42:43.328
You couldn't have known.

42:43.346 --> 42:44.496
No! I should've known.

42:44.514 --> 42:47.432
And if I were clear-headed,
I would have known!

42:47.467 --> 42:48.767
Carl, I need you.

42:48.801 --> 42:49.935
Why do you need

42:49.969 --> 42:52.471
a guy who lets his partner
walk into an ambush?

42:52.505 --> 42:54.473
What exactly am I...

42:54.507 --> 42:55.691
What am I giving to your team?

42:55.725 --> 42:57.025
So you're running away?

42:57.060 --> 42:58.861
Accepting my limitations
isn't running away.

42:58.895 --> 43:01.980
I'm not risking any more cops

43:02.014 --> 43:03.982
pretending that I can
still do the job again.

43:04.016 --> 43:05.367
You know what?

43:05.401 --> 43:07.369
When this is over,
I don't give a damn what you do,

43:07.403 --> 43:10.706
but I gave you the authority
to be a cop again,

43:10.740 --> 43:12.457
so do it!

43:12.492 --> 43:14.743
After, you can crawl
back to your carnival.

43:14.794 --> 43:15.911
I don't care,

43:15.962 --> 43:18.330
but this is your mess
to clean up!

43:22.468 --> 43:25.554
If we find this girl alive...

43:26.556 --> 43:27.839
I'm out.

43:27.873 --> 43:28.924
You understand?

43:33.879 --> 43:34.879
Fine.

43:38.851 --> 43:40.402
See what he does?

43:40.436 --> 43:42.070
Come here.

43:44.407 --> 43:46.525
He pushed the body
way back there,

43:46.559 --> 43:47.693
and then he goes to hide.

43:47.727 --> 43:49.795
So, when Anne-Marie
comes in,

43:49.829 --> 43:52.063
she's drawn towards the body?

43:55.368 --> 43:57.753
Then he grabs
the evidence bag with the shoe

43:57.787 --> 43:58.870
and doesn't even look at it.

43:58.904 --> 44:02.407
Like he already knew
what was in it.

44:02.425 --> 44:03.625
And who was coming.

44:03.676 --> 44:05.427
He did.

44:05.461 --> 44:07.346
He knew that shoe
was out there somewhere.

44:07.380 --> 44:09.097
We found tracks where
he was searching for it.

44:09.132 --> 44:11.967
He was there...

44:12.018 --> 44:13.468
Waiting for us
to find something,

44:13.519 --> 44:14.553
or the scene to open up.

44:14.587 --> 44:19.808
This guy is methodical,
thorough and smart.

44:19.859 --> 44:20.776
Smarter than us.

44:20.810 --> 44:21.977
You speak for yourself.

44:22.028 --> 44:23.362
I am.

44:23.396 --> 44:25.480
We have the customers' database.
It may be helpful.

44:25.531 --> 44:27.449
- Look for male names.
- Male?

44:27.483 --> 44:28.600
He may have seen us

44:28.635 --> 44:30.402
find the shoe...

44:32.455 --> 44:35.374
But how would he have known
that this is the store?

44:35.408 --> 44:36.208
This is the very store!

44:36.242 --> 44:40.879
Did he not show up here first?

44:40.913 --> 44:41.946
He bought them.

44:41.965 --> 44:44.082
Son of a bitch.

44:44.116 --> 44:46.585
My Scangen.

44:46.619 --> 44:48.804
If he was there
the whole time...

44:48.838 --> 44:50.789
I used the lasers at the scene.

44:50.807 --> 44:52.507
Are you saying you might have
a picture of him?

44:52.558 --> 44:55.594
Well, not a picture exactly,
but an image. It's possible.

44:55.628 --> 44:56.561
I need a face.

44:56.596 --> 44:58.647
Well... scanner's
at the crime squad.

44:58.681 --> 45:00.482
That's where we start.

45:10.443 --> 45:12.444
No... I tried!

45:12.478 --> 45:16.698
It's too fast!
Do you understand?

45:16.749 --> 45:19.167
No! I tried! I tried.

45:19.202 --> 45:21.986
I did! I did...

45:22.005 --> 45:24.006
I need time to think, okay?

45:24.040 --> 45:25.624
I just need
a little time to th...

45:30.179 --> 45:32.764
This is Gerald.

45:32.799 --> 45:34.783
Hi, yes, ma'am.

45:34.817 --> 45:36.718
No, no, no, no, no.

45:36.769 --> 45:38.720
Everything's completely
taken care of in Paris.

45:38.771 --> 45:41.123
Yes, you know I never
leave things half-completed.

45:41.157 --> 45:43.058
Of course. Of course.

45:43.109 --> 45:45.510
I always have
my cell phone with me.

45:45.528 --> 45:47.679
Yes, ma'am. I will.

45:47.697 --> 45:49.614
Thank you.

45:51.183 --> 45:53.535
Will I have my phone with me?

45:53.569 --> 45:55.821
Don't I always,
you ridiculous bitch?

45:57.123 --> 46:00.709
Have I ever, even once,

46:00.743 --> 46:03.528
not had my phone with me

46:03.546 --> 46:06.498
when you call, over and over?

46:06.532 --> 46:10.335
Yes! I have my phone!
I have my phone!

46:10.369 --> 46:12.537
- Where do we go?
- Upstairs.

46:12.555 --> 46:14.172
Eva, can you bring
the blue bag?

46:14.206 --> 46:15.557
Anything from the checkpoints?

46:15.591 --> 46:16.558
Nothing so far,

46:16.592 --> 46:18.477
but we'll keep them up
as long as it takes.

46:18.511 --> 46:20.479
Uh, you'll say this was
your operation, right?

46:22.348 --> 46:24.766
Yeah. It was
my responsibility.

46:27.353 --> 46:28.887
You do know the killer
must've gotten past

46:28.905 --> 46:30.405
any checkpoints by now.

46:30.440 --> 46:32.858
This guy can't stop
every route out of Paris.

46:32.892 --> 46:34.559
Yes. I know.

46:34.577 --> 46:37.579
He's keeping them up
to cover himself.

46:38.998 --> 46:40.732
Excuse me?

46:42.668 --> 46:43.618
Dorn?

46:43.669 --> 46:44.836
I'm in Paris.

46:44.871 --> 46:46.538
I need to speak with you.

46:46.572 --> 46:47.923
No, I can't.

46:47.957 --> 46:49.674
I didn't say it would be
nice to speak with you,

46:49.709 --> 46:51.343
I said I need to.

46:51.377 --> 46:53.261
About?

46:53.296 --> 46:54.412
Your son, Etienne.

46:54.430 --> 46:57.415
Okay.

46:57.433 --> 46:59.434
So the room back there's okay?

46:59.469 --> 47:00.769
To the left.

47:00.803 --> 47:02.521
Can I help you?

47:04.590 --> 47:05.557
Carl, I need to go somewhere.

47:05.591 --> 47:07.359
Meet with a source.

47:07.393 --> 47:09.260
Yeah. Yeah, I got this.

47:11.948 --> 47:14.282
Hickman.

47:14.317 --> 47:16.234
The crime scene photos.

47:16.268 --> 47:17.385
Paris.

47:17.420 --> 47:18.420
London.

47:18.454 --> 47:20.655
Rome. Dublin.
Every scene, every body.

47:20.706 --> 47:24.459
You're Scotland Yard, right?

47:24.494 --> 47:26.294
We call it The Met, but, yeah.

47:26.329 --> 47:27.662
You have access
to their databases?

47:27.713 --> 47:28.663
Yeah.

47:28.714 --> 47:30.281
We know
this guy is mobile, right?

47:30.299 --> 47:31.883
Four bodies,
four different countries.

47:31.918 --> 47:33.335
But what if the women missing

47:33.386 --> 47:35.003
aren't from the country
they were found in?

47:35.054 --> 47:37.389
What if the missing women
are from the previous one?

47:37.423 --> 47:38.640
You mean like
the girl we found in Paris

47:38.674 --> 47:40.809
could be from London?

47:40.843 --> 47:42.394
Yeah.

47:42.428 --> 47:44.295
Maybe your friends at the Yard

47:44.313 --> 47:46.848
could recheck our Paris girl...

47:46.899 --> 47:48.350
With missings
from the U.K.?

47:48.401 --> 47:50.301
Yeah. Yeah, that might work.

47:51.804 --> 47:53.822
Hang on, Anne-Marie.

48:06.919 --> 48:08.503
Okay. Okay...

48:08.538 --> 48:11.322
Okay, that happened.

48:11.340 --> 48:12.858
I need to think.

48:18.998 --> 48:20.348
This is what happens, Gerald.

48:20.383 --> 48:22.517
This is what happens
without control.

48:56.535 --> 48:58.587
I thought you'd be awake.

49:02.758 --> 49:04.976
Padma! Can you hold on a sec?

49:09.148 --> 49:11.483
Hi!

49:11.517 --> 49:13.351
Oh...

49:13.385 --> 49:14.736
That's sweet of you
to remember.

49:14.770 --> 49:18.940
Uh, no, actually,
I'm in Paris on a case.

49:18.991 --> 49:21.392
You know I don't really like
to celebrate anyway.

49:21.410 --> 49:24.829
Thanks, Padma.
I miss you, too.

49:24.864 --> 49:28.917
Cheers.
Thanks for the call.

49:36.008 --> 49:37.575
Okay, guys, it's ready.

49:37.593 --> 49:39.928
Here goes.

49:41.580 --> 49:43.414
Wow.

49:43.432 --> 49:44.716
That is
pretty impressive, Sebastian.

49:44.750 --> 49:46.584
In a more
controlled environment,

49:46.602 --> 49:49.087
we could even look for evidence
that was missed.

49:49.105 --> 49:51.422
Right, now what we need is
an image of one wanker.

49:51.440 --> 49:53.758
This guy would've gotten
as close as possible

49:53.776 --> 49:55.060
without attracting attention.

49:55.094 --> 49:57.562
Yeah. Outside the tape, right?
That's a good distance.

49:57.596 --> 50:01.032
Let me widen it out
to the limit of the scan.

50:14.080 --> 50:15.947
Okay, am I missing something?

50:15.965 --> 50:17.132
If you are, I am, too.

50:20.586 --> 50:23.004
What's that?

50:26.125 --> 50:27.509
Oh, that's the entrance
to the crime scene.

50:27.560 --> 50:28.593
Wasn't there a guard there?

50:28.627 --> 50:29.644
Let's have a closer look.

50:32.765 --> 50:33.898
Yeah. I remember him.

50:33.933 --> 50:35.817
- Young guy.
- And anyone trying...

50:35.851 --> 50:38.153
To get into the scene
would've had to talk to him.

50:38.187 --> 50:39.854
So this makes

50:39.905 --> 50:41.906
this guard potentially
our first eye-witness.

50:41.941 --> 50:43.742
Anne-Marie knew him.
His name was...

50:43.776 --> 50:44.826
Laffont.

50:46.529 --> 50:48.580
Cadet Antoine Laffont.

50:48.614 --> 50:50.999
All right,
well, I'll go and talk to him.

50:51.033 --> 50:53.118
I'll go with you.
We should stay paired up.

50:54.787 --> 50:56.588
I'm starting
to think we need to rely on

50:56.622 --> 50:57.956
the worst thing a cop
ever has to...

51:00.659 --> 51:02.160
Luck.

51:33.147 --> 51:35.035
- Bonsoir, monsieur.
- Bonsoir.

51:35.069 --> 51:36.036
Though I warn you,

51:36.071 --> 51:37.471
that is close to
the limit of my French.

51:37.505 --> 51:38.506
American?

51:38.540 --> 51:42.560
Guilty.
I'm with the diplomatic corps.

51:42.611 --> 51:44.562
This is an embassy vehicle.

51:44.613 --> 51:47.481
I see the plates.

51:47.515 --> 51:49.700
I had a flat I fixed,

51:49.734 --> 51:50.818
and I'm sort of in a hurry.

51:50.852 --> 51:53.037
Where'd the blood come from?

51:56.741 --> 51:58.075
This is so funny.

51:58.126 --> 51:59.076
I was, uh...

51:59.127 --> 52:01.695
I was tightening the bolts,

52:01.713 --> 52:05.699
and my hand slipped,
and I hit myself in the face.

52:05.717 --> 52:08.385
My nose is very sensitive.

52:08.420 --> 52:09.887
It bleeds very easily.

52:09.921 --> 52:11.972
See?

52:12.007 --> 52:14.391
I don't mean to be
disrespectful,

52:14.426 --> 52:17.144
but I really should be
getting back on the road.

52:23.735 --> 52:26.053
Merci.

52:33.461 --> 52:34.628
I'll help.

52:34.662 --> 52:36.463
No, no, no, no, no, no!

52:36.497 --> 52:38.215
I... it's...
As I said, it's fixed.

52:38.266 --> 52:39.999
Open the trunk.

52:40.017 --> 52:41.518
No! Um...

52:41.552 --> 52:44.337
I'd rather you put it
in the back seat.

52:44.355 --> 52:46.440
It will tear your leather.

52:46.474 --> 52:49.559
The... the ambassador's suitcases

52:49.610 --> 52:51.978
and personal items
are in that trunk.

52:52.012 --> 52:53.680
I cannot allow them
to be damaged.

52:53.714 --> 52:56.233
I would rather damage
these seats

52:56.267 --> 52:58.518
than the ambassador's
hat boxes.

52:58.552 --> 52:59.770
The rich cow...

52:59.821 --> 53:03.573
She would have me sacked
within the hour.

53:16.070 --> 53:17.087
Thank you so much, officer.

53:17.121 --> 53:18.538
That is very kind of you.

53:18.572 --> 53:21.041
<i>Merci. Merci beaucoup.</i>

53:21.075 --> 53:24.244
<i>- Bonsoir.</i>
<i>- Bonsoir.</i>

53:35.606 --> 53:38.058
He's a Russian.

53:38.092 --> 53:39.776
An ex-colonel of the army.

53:39.811 --> 53:43.563
Went underground
about 20 years ago...

53:43.597 --> 53:44.731
Took an armory

53:44.765 --> 53:48.285
and a cadre of very loyal
officers with him.

53:50.655 --> 53:51.822
Dimitrov.

53:51.873 --> 53:54.624
Alexander Dimitrov.

53:54.659 --> 53:56.459
You're sure?

53:56.494 --> 54:00.580
I have known my source
for a very long time...

54:00.614 --> 54:01.631
And they are sure.

54:01.666 --> 54:03.216
Do you trust them?

54:03.251 --> 54:06.386
Yes.

54:06.420 --> 54:08.505
But more than that, Louis...

54:08.556 --> 54:09.622
I trust fear,

54:09.640 --> 54:11.291
because, if there is anything
in this world

54:11.309 --> 54:12.809
that I know anything about,

54:12.844 --> 54:16.279
it's fear,

54:16.314 --> 54:18.398
and these people
fear that man,

54:18.432 --> 54:20.517
and they want him stopped
almost as much as you do.

54:20.568 --> 54:22.402
"Almost."

54:24.438 --> 54:29.242
I was able to obtain everything
you asked me to get for you,

54:29.277 --> 54:31.278
but I want you
to think about it.

54:31.312 --> 54:33.646
If you let me take
this envelope,

54:33.664 --> 54:36.199
unopened...

54:36.250 --> 54:38.618
I will use its contents

54:38.652 --> 54:42.789
to make him pay
for what he did to Etienne,

54:42.823 --> 54:44.791
for what he did to you
and Rebecca.

54:44.825 --> 54:47.210
I don't understand.

54:47.261 --> 54:48.378
I will find him

54:48.429 --> 54:51.164
and I will bring him to justice
in the courts.

54:51.182 --> 54:53.884
You've killed before,
but you won't kill him?

54:53.935 --> 54:55.468
Well, I've never
murdered anyone.

54:55.502 --> 54:56.469
It's not the same.

54:56.503 --> 54:58.671
So why unopened?

54:58.689 --> 55:03.727
Because it contains everything
you need to know to find him,

55:03.778 --> 55:06.196
and I will not
have you hunting for him

55:06.230 --> 55:08.181
while I am.

55:09.617 --> 55:11.818
I need to think about it.

55:16.624 --> 55:18.241
How is your case going?

55:18.292 --> 55:20.243
We'll get him.

55:20.294 --> 55:22.329
I have no doubt.

55:31.923 --> 55:35.208
Laffont gets off shift
in five minutes.

55:41.899 --> 55:42.715
Hold on.

55:46.837 --> 55:48.588
You know all that bollocks
I said earlier,

55:48.623 --> 55:50.907
about how great
havin' a big family is?

55:50.942 --> 55:52.826
That was bollocks, was it?

55:52.860 --> 55:55.578
My da...

55:57.465 --> 55:59.215
My da actually has
a hit out on me.

56:00.251 --> 56:01.217
A paid-for hit.

56:02.703 --> 56:03.837
You're serious?

56:03.871 --> 56:07.557
10,000 pounds.

56:07.591 --> 56:09.342
I don't even know
where he got 10,000 pounds.

56:09.376 --> 56:11.377
But he put it up

56:11.395 --> 56:13.346
when I joined
the police services.

56:13.380 --> 56:14.648
Now I'm a target

56:14.682 --> 56:16.433
for any Traveller
who might come across me.

56:16.484 --> 56:19.386
Your family wants you dead?

56:19.420 --> 56:22.272
Very.

56:22.323 --> 56:23.239
Why are you telling me this?

56:23.274 --> 56:27.277
Because, if we're to be...

56:27.311 --> 56:29.562
gonna be partnered,

56:29.580 --> 56:30.647
then...

56:30.681 --> 56:32.999
You should know
what you're dealing with.

56:34.435 --> 56:35.585
I guess I'm just saying

56:35.619 --> 56:38.738
that, you know, having
a great, big family's...

56:41.242 --> 56:44.661
Not always such a good thing.

56:50.351 --> 56:51.634
Here's our guy.

57:10.654 --> 57:11.621
<i>Go ahead.</i>

57:11.655 --> 57:12.956
I need a minute.

57:12.990 --> 57:14.491
No trouble. Take your time.

57:14.542 --> 57:16.826
Anne-Marie!

57:54.975 --> 57:56.008
Thanks.

57:56.043 --> 57:58.594
We'll let you know
as soon as we know more.

57:58.628 --> 58:00.680
- It's not her.
- Thank God.

58:00.731 --> 58:02.098
- The body in the woods...
- It's an overdose.

58:02.132 --> 58:03.132
A known local junkie.

58:04.301 --> 58:06.936
Let's go back to the beginning.

58:08.272 --> 58:09.655
I've been looking at
the crime scenes.

58:09.690 --> 58:11.607
They aren't exact matches,

58:11.641 --> 58:12.592
but look at that.

58:12.626 --> 58:14.277
Isn't everything
just a bit too similar?

58:14.311 --> 58:15.845
You mean staged?

58:15.879 --> 58:17.029
Chasing them through the woods

58:17.080 --> 58:18.781
is part of his thing, right?

58:18.815 --> 58:20.249
The similarities
could be coincidence.

58:20.284 --> 58:21.751
I'm thinking
that he's recreating something.

58:21.785 --> 58:24.153
We all said that we thought
he was putting on a show.

58:24.171 --> 58:25.671
It's not a show.
It's a ritual.

58:25.706 --> 58:27.039
He doesn't hide the bodies.

58:27.090 --> 58:29.658
So if she's not found soon,
it's a good thing?

58:29.676 --> 58:31.177
She probably survived
the night.

58:31.211 --> 58:33.796
Which means he could
get back on script,

58:33.830 --> 58:35.631
back on ritual.

58:35.665 --> 58:38.134
Which means he will take her
to a capital city.

58:38.168 --> 58:42.054
Great. So, by tonight,
he could be anywhere from, uh...

58:42.105 --> 58:45.024
Oslo to Athens.

58:45.058 --> 58:47.109
All right.
Let me arrange something.

58:50.680 --> 58:52.348
He spoke to a lot of people,

58:52.366 --> 58:54.367
but can't remember any of them.

58:54.401 --> 58:55.868
Look at him.

58:55.902 --> 58:56.869
The way his eyes dart

58:56.903 --> 58:57.953
and his eyebrows are raised,

58:57.988 --> 58:59.989
his mouth, the corners
are pulled back.

59:00.023 --> 59:01.240
You see all that?

59:01.291 --> 59:02.792
He's afraid.

59:02.826 --> 59:04.360
You mean
like in "suspect" afraid?

59:04.378 --> 59:06.695
No.

59:06.713 --> 59:08.697
Laveaux bullies
all his officers.

59:08.715 --> 59:10.800
There has to be a way
to get him past that

59:10.834 --> 59:12.084
and remember.

59:12.135 --> 59:14.086
I could try something.

59:15.839 --> 59:18.140
I'm sorry. I've tried.

59:18.175 --> 59:20.893
I can't remember
any specific details.

59:20.927 --> 59:23.095
Nobody thinks
you haven't tried.

59:23.130 --> 59:24.313
Nobody thinks

59:24.348 --> 59:25.815
that you haven't told us

59:25.849 --> 59:27.683
everything
that you consciously know.

59:27.717 --> 59:29.885
Please... sit.

59:33.664 --> 59:37.410
You said "consciously"?

59:37.444 --> 59:39.695
Well, sometimes,

59:39.729 --> 59:41.063
attempting to retrieve a memory

59:41.081 --> 59:42.231
is almost impossible,

59:42.249 --> 59:44.900
in the traditional way.

59:44.918 --> 59:47.370
It could be because of trauma,

59:47.404 --> 59:49.188
it could be because of fear,

59:49.222 --> 59:52.758
or it could be

59:52.793 --> 59:54.427
because we're under so much
pressure to get it right,

59:54.461 --> 59:56.996
that we freeze up.

59:57.030 --> 59:58.297
But I've told you everything.

59:58.348 --> 59:59.348
Not everything.

59:59.383 --> 01:00:00.416
Yes.

01:00:00.434 --> 01:00:01.467
You haven't told me
if it was warm.

01:00:01.518 --> 01:00:03.886
Excuse me?

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.271
Was it warm?

01:00:05.305 --> 01:00:06.806
How is it related to...?

01:00:06.857 --> 01:00:09.442
Just...

01:00:09.476 --> 01:00:10.726
tell me.

01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:14.480
I think it was around 24 or 25.

01:00:14.531 --> 01:00:16.732
No, no, no.

01:00:16.766 --> 01:00:19.251
Were you warm?

01:00:19.286 --> 01:00:22.371
Don't give me the fact,
give me the feeling.

01:00:22.406 --> 01:00:25.741
Yes, I was warm.

01:00:25.776 --> 01:00:28.961
Most of the day...

01:00:28.995 --> 01:00:30.279
It was cooler

01:00:30.297 --> 01:00:34.383
when the sun
went behind the clouds.

01:00:34.418 --> 01:00:37.119
Good.

01:00:37.137 --> 01:00:39.054
Now what do you smell?

01:00:40.424 --> 01:00:41.957
Leaves.

01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:43.175
Damp leaves.

01:00:43.226 --> 01:00:47.012
And they cut the grass
yesterday.

01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:51.517
Now, what do you hear?

01:00:53.353 --> 01:00:55.137
Antoine?

01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:57.123
What do you hear?

01:00:57.157 --> 01:00:58.474
It's what I don't hear.

01:00:58.508 --> 01:01:00.526
I'm sorry?

01:01:00.577 --> 01:01:04.263
There should be children
in a park.

01:01:04.297 --> 01:01:06.115
And there's no children?

01:01:06.149 --> 01:01:08.134
No.

01:01:08.168 --> 01:01:10.236
They can't play
because of the crime scene.

01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:13.839
I hear the people complaining.

01:01:13.874 --> 01:01:16.342
People want their park back.

01:01:16.376 --> 01:01:18.127
And how does that
make you feel?

01:01:18.161 --> 01:01:20.379
I wish they could have
their picnics,

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:23.382
and play in the playgrounds
and walk their...

01:01:25.218 --> 01:01:26.552
What is it?

01:01:28.939 --> 01:01:29.838
There was a man...

01:01:29.856 --> 01:01:31.140
He had a dog.

01:01:31.174 --> 01:01:32.841
The dog!

01:01:32.859 --> 01:01:34.477
The dog?

01:01:34.511 --> 01:01:38.164
The dog that was dead later
in the park.

01:01:38.198 --> 01:01:39.815
He killed it!

01:01:39.849 --> 01:01:41.317
What do we know about this dog?

01:01:41.351 --> 01:01:42.284
There was a dead dog.

01:01:42.319 --> 01:01:44.870
We didn't know
that someone killed him.

01:01:44.905 --> 01:01:47.456
Eva, Sebastian, details.

01:01:47.491 --> 01:01:49.074
This man...

01:01:49.125 --> 01:01:51.026
Can you describe him?

01:01:54.631 --> 01:01:58.000
Only that he was very short.

01:01:59.219 --> 01:02:00.291
She's good.

01:02:00.411 --> 01:02:02.221
Yeah. You all are.

01:02:03.657 --> 01:02:05.441
If Anne-Marie were dead,

01:02:05.475 --> 01:02:07.810
she would have
been found by now.

01:02:07.828 --> 01:02:09.862
What does it mean for her?

01:02:11.498 --> 01:02:12.982
If he has somewhere to go...

01:02:14.535 --> 01:02:15.952
To be alone with her...

01:02:15.986 --> 01:02:19.155
To have time
to get his ritual back...

01:02:21.792 --> 01:02:27.847
<i>Then who and what she is</i>
<i>will mean less and less.</i>

01:02:27.881 --> 01:02:30.633
<i>She'll just become</i>
<i>another of his fantasies...</i>

01:02:34.021 --> 01:02:36.022
<i>Until tonight.</i>

01:02:39.535 --> 01:02:41.293
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:02:41.413 --> 01:02:43.319
Paris Animal Control collected
the dog corpse.

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:44.701
It had a microchip in it,

01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:46.529
registered
to a local animal shelter.

01:02:46.563 --> 01:02:48.531
Eva and Sebastian
are headed there now.

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:50.482
Antoine's description's
at all the checkpoints now,

01:02:50.516 --> 01:02:51.700
but I don't hold out much hope.

01:02:51.735 --> 01:02:54.170
The distinctive part
of the description is his height

01:02:54.204 --> 01:02:56.071
and he's gonna be in a car,
sitting down.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.689
The Met came through.

01:02:57.707 --> 01:02:59.291
They identified her?

01:02:59.326 --> 01:03:00.492
The girl found in Paris

01:03:00.526 --> 01:03:02.411
appears to be a missing
from southeast London,

01:03:02.462 --> 01:03:04.079
named Sasha Quinn.

01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:05.998
Same height, same hair color,

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:06.999
and she was reported

01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:09.084
the very night
the Paris body was found.

01:03:09.135 --> 01:03:11.387
They're getting DNA information
from her parents,

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:13.389
but they have to be
a bit sensitive,

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:15.040
because, it seems,
she was an escort.

01:03:15.058 --> 01:03:16.675
Try the agency.

01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:19.728
They keep information
on their clients.

01:03:19.763 --> 01:03:21.430
I'm thinking...
Her being an escort

01:03:21.481 --> 01:03:23.065
makes the choice of shoe
even more peculiar.

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:24.483
What do you mean?

01:03:24.517 --> 01:03:27.719
It's heavy. The heel is short,
it's vintage, unflattering.

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:29.388
Not sexy enough?

01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:30.573
No, I wouldn't think so.

01:03:30.607 --> 01:03:32.491
If you don't want them sexy...

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:37.396
Are you dressing them
completely?

01:03:50.677 --> 01:03:51.743
Where are we?

01:03:51.761 --> 01:03:54.079
In a lovely apartment

01:03:54.097 --> 01:03:57.082
the diplomatic corps keeps
for advanced workers.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.583
Diplomatic?

01:03:58.602 --> 01:04:00.269
It's very cozy...

01:04:02.689 --> 01:04:04.423
It's very private.

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:05.757
Discreet.

01:04:11.815 --> 01:04:13.816
I'm an officer of
the French National Police.

01:04:13.867 --> 01:04:16.402
If you let me go, I...

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:17.602
I will speak to the magistrate

01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:19.204
and I will tell him
you were very compassionate.

01:04:19.239 --> 01:04:21.073
You know, I'd normally
let you do this yourself,

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.708
but this is all very different,
isn't it?

01:04:22.742 --> 01:04:25.244
There's still a chance for you!

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:27.496
Completely different.

01:04:27.547 --> 01:04:28.831
I don't mean anything untoward,

01:04:28.882 --> 01:04:30.382
but...

01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:31.750
But it's time.

01:04:33.837 --> 01:04:34.803
Time?

01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:37.339
Time to change.

01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:40.392
Okay. So we have a name
and we may have a picture.

01:04:40.427 --> 01:04:44.813
The dog was adopted yesterday by
<i>a man called "John Smith."</i>

01:04:44.848 --> 01:04:46.765
It's about as anonymous a name
as you could use...

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:48.400
- But in America.
- Yeah, Britain, too.

01:04:48.435 --> 01:04:51.437
Yeah, but they have
CCTV cameras here.

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:52.688
I think I've got him!

01:04:52.739 --> 01:04:54.606
Do you have him?

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:03.648
Sending now.

01:05:07.504 --> 01:05:08.754
Got you.

01:05:08.788 --> 01:05:10.456
Get that face
to every cop in Europe.

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:12.157
I want it on P.D.A.'s,

01:05:12.175 --> 01:05:14.710
cell phones,
any device anyone might have.

01:05:14.761 --> 01:05:16.879
I want to know who he is.

01:05:26.056 --> 01:05:27.807
I didn't want
to do it this way, but...

01:05:30.694 --> 01:05:32.061
No!

01:05:32.112 --> 01:05:33.896
There's still a chance... there's
still a chance to do it right!

01:05:34.016 --> 01:05:34.914
I really wish
you'd cooperate.

01:05:35.034 --> 01:05:36.181
No, no, no, no, no!

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:48.878
The escort agency says
Sasha's last client was a man

01:05:48.912 --> 01:05:50.079
named...

01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:51.747
John Smith.
So he's British?

01:05:51.798 --> 01:05:53.666
Well, not necessarily.
They also said

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.201
that she only handled
international clients.

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.753
I just hung up with Interpol.

01:05:57.804 --> 01:05:59.171
Tell me you have his name?

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:02.374
And it's been verified
through another agency.

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:04.343
- Which agency?
- The State Department.

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:05.978
His name is Gerald Wilhoit.

01:06:06.013 --> 01:06:09.015
He's a traveling
advance secretary

01:06:09.049 --> 01:06:11.267
from the U.S. Diplomatic Corps.

01:06:11.318 --> 01:06:13.218
That's how
he got around so easily.

01:06:13.237 --> 01:06:15.354
And why nobody
stopped him at any checkpoints.

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:17.356
He's an American?

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.724
With diplomatic immunity.

01:06:18.742 --> 01:06:20.910
We have a hit on the photo!
Highway patrol.

01:06:20.944 --> 01:06:22.445
A gendarme pulled over
to assist a motorist

01:06:22.496 --> 01:06:24.864
with a flat tire
in the middle of the night.

01:06:24.898 --> 01:06:26.999
He says he's sure from the photo
it's our guy.

01:06:27.034 --> 01:06:28.901
Where?

01:06:28.919 --> 01:06:30.870
E50, 25 kilometers
outside Metz,

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:32.221
heading east.

01:06:32.256 --> 01:06:34.740
- He's going to Germany?
- He's taken her to Berlin.

01:06:55.682 --> 01:06:58.056
_

01:06:59.217 --> 01:07:03.223
_

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:06.154
You don't keep one in the pipe?

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:08.940
Had them jam
too much that way.

01:07:08.974 --> 01:07:11.827
I'll take my chances with
a piece that's ready to go.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.111
Hmm.

01:07:13.145 --> 01:07:14.579
Wouldn't need to,
if you were fast.

01:07:14.877 --> 01:07:17.632
_

01:07:24.757 --> 01:07:27.092
Do you even have a gun?

01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:28.627
Never really needed one.

01:07:28.661 --> 01:07:29.661
Brits.

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:31.680
<i>Danke.</i>

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:34.182
GSG9 is gonna meet us
wherever we say.

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:35.183
GSG9?

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.501
You say "SWAT."

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:38.837
Tell me about
the parks in Berlin.

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:40.555
There are several large ones.

01:07:40.606 --> 01:07:42.224
Remember the scene,
remember the bad guy.

01:07:42.275 --> 01:07:44.776
We're looking
for a wooded area.

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:47.612
Busy during the day,
but not at all at night.

01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:48.780
Somewhere near
the center of the city.

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:51.182
Tiergarten's
the right kind of park.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.237
But there's also
Volkspark Friedrichshain.

01:07:55.288 --> 01:07:56.788
Sebastian, we don't
have time to be wrong.

01:07:56.823 --> 01:07:58.490
Which park is it?

01:07:58.524 --> 01:08:01.660
Tiergarten or Volkspark?
Which one?

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:08.133
Tiergarten.

01:08:11.203 --> 01:08:13.004
All right.
Be cautious with Wilhoit.

01:08:13.038 --> 01:08:14.723
He's not only dangerous,

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:16.640
he has diplomatic immunity.

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.009
So, if you find him,

01:08:18.042 --> 01:08:20.044
make sure Detective Hickman
gets over there,

01:08:20.063 --> 01:08:21.063
unless you want him

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.848
to have grounds
for beating his arrest.

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:33.892
Stay in your grid.

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:35.225
Stay in contact.

01:08:35.243 --> 01:08:37.060
Be ready on my signal.
All right?

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.865
We move out in two minutes.

01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:41.283
Do you know how to use this?

01:08:41.334 --> 01:08:43.734
I said I never needed one,

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:44.786
not that I didn't know how.

01:08:46.572 --> 01:08:47.839
Who's Padma?

01:08:49.908 --> 01:08:50.908
It's your birthday, right?

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:53.712
She called you
for your birthday?

01:08:53.746 --> 01:08:56.214
She's my nanny.

01:08:56.247 --> 01:08:59.551
She always calls me
for my birthday.

01:08:59.585 --> 01:09:00.886
But your parents haven't.

01:09:02.587 --> 01:09:03.921
I've been with you
for the last two days.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:05.756
No one else called.

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:08.810
Well, they're...
very busy.

01:09:08.861 --> 01:09:10.862
They're important people
with important jobs.

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:12.697
Sienna.
We don't make a big deal...

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:13.899
of birthdays
in my family anyway.

01:09:13.933 --> 01:09:15.265
Sienna!

01:09:15.283 --> 01:09:16.984
All I'm saying is,

01:09:17.036 --> 01:09:19.604
it doesn't matter
that they haven't called.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.706
All our families
are messed up.

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:25.109
All I'm trying to say is...

01:09:26.129 --> 01:09:27.111
cheers.

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:29.798
Cheers, and...

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.267
Happy Birthday.

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:49.350
Remember what I said
outside the morgue?

01:09:49.402 --> 01:09:51.603
Take deeper breaths?

01:09:53.973 --> 01:09:56.975
I said,
"We'll finish this... later."

01:09:56.993 --> 01:09:59.744
Yes, ma'am, inspector Pride.

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:01.363
We'll finish this later.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.785
Come on! Let's go!

01:10:17.263 --> 01:10:19.347
Don't move,
or it'll be too deep.

01:10:26.338 --> 01:10:28.690
It's all over, it's done.

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:30.692
What... what's done?

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:32.143
You're dying.

01:10:32.177 --> 01:10:35.230
No!

01:10:37.817 --> 01:10:39.367
You have one chance.

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:42.287
Run.

01:10:49.143 --> 01:10:51.161
Run!

01:10:52.646 --> 01:10:54.097
<i>Son of a bitch hunted her.</i>

01:10:54.115 --> 01:10:55.865
Run!

01:10:58.285 --> 01:11:01.154
<i>She was dead the moment</i>
<i>she showed him fear.</i>

01:11:11.415 --> 01:11:12.615
No.

01:11:12.633 --> 01:11:14.951
What did you say?

01:11:16.504 --> 01:11:18.147
I said run!

01:11:18.267 --> 01:11:19.180
No.

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:21.508
I'll kill you right here!

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.419
I'm not afraid of you.

01:11:24.539 --> 01:11:26.615
- Run!
- No!

01:11:27.932 --> 01:11:29.566
Ah!

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.484
Run, you bitch!

01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:40.527
No.

01:11:40.578 --> 01:11:42.412
I am in charge here!

01:11:42.446 --> 01:11:45.915
Who am I supposed to be,
Gerald? Huh?

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:48.868
Who did you think
you were talking to,

01:11:48.919 --> 01:11:51.870
when you were alone
in the front seat, Gerald?

01:11:54.041 --> 01:11:55.458
Run!

01:11:56.844 --> 01:12:00.410
<i>He seems to have some sort</i>
<i>of ritual that plays out...</i>

01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:02.380
<i>before the murder.</i>

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.650
No! It's all a fantasy...

01:12:04.701 --> 01:12:07.236
The park, the...
the hunting!

01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:09.205
<i>He didn't just conceal</i>
<i>their identities,</i>

01:12:09.239 --> 01:12:11.741
<i>he erased them.</i>

01:12:11.775 --> 01:12:15.294
You dressed me up! Who am I?
Who am I supposed to be?

01:12:15.328 --> 01:12:17.279
- Run!
- No!

01:12:17.297 --> 01:12:18.748
- Run!
- No!

01:12:18.782 --> 01:12:19.999
- You bitch.
- No!

01:12:20.050 --> 01:12:21.717
You do what I say. Yes!

01:12:21.752 --> 01:12:26.589
You do it,
and you do it now! Okay? Run!

01:12:28.175 --> 01:12:31.510
<i>It's odd, it's actually</i>
<i>a very old style.</i>

01:12:31.561 --> 01:12:33.095
Gerald...

01:12:33.129 --> 01:12:34.263
Gerald, please.

01:12:34.297 --> 01:12:35.231
Is it your mother?

01:12:36.817 --> 01:12:37.800
Is it your mother?

01:12:37.818 --> 01:12:39.735
The older shoes,
the older dress?

01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:42.605
I'm not your mother!

01:12:42.639 --> 01:12:45.825
I'm a detective
in the French National Police.

01:12:45.859 --> 01:12:48.527
You've taken a police officer.

01:12:48.578 --> 01:12:50.196
Anne-Marie!

01:12:52.532 --> 01:12:54.083
Gerald, they know
who you are.

01:12:54.117 --> 01:12:55.951
- Who?
- The police.

01:12:55.985 --> 01:12:57.420
Anne-Marie!

01:12:58.965 --> 01:13:00.502
I am Detective San.

01:13:00.622 --> 01:13:01.589
You are sick,

01:13:01.623 --> 01:13:03.574
and I can help you,
and I can...

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:06.794
I am not sick!

01:13:06.845 --> 01:13:10.264
You filthy bitch!

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:13.751
Anne-Marie!

01:13:13.769 --> 01:13:15.386
Over here!

01:13:16.588 --> 01:13:19.273
Anne-Marie!

01:13:19.308 --> 01:13:21.258
Are you okay?

01:13:21.276 --> 01:13:23.478
- Get her up! Get her up!
- She's bleeding!

01:13:23.529 --> 01:13:26.447
- Medic! Medic!
- Over here!

01:13:26.482 --> 01:13:27.865
I wouldn't run.
I wouldn't show fear.

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:30.401
You did good.
You did really good.

01:13:30.435 --> 01:13:32.370
You got her? Hold her!

01:13:32.404 --> 01:13:35.239
- Come on, get her.
- Over here.

01:13:37.409 --> 01:13:39.008
Give me your gun.

01:13:39.694 --> 01:13:41.398
Give me your gun.

01:13:44.351 --> 01:13:45.851
- Hickman.
- What?

01:13:47.721 --> 01:13:48.604
Do you need this?

01:13:48.655 --> 01:13:52.723
No... no!

01:14:37.704 --> 01:14:39.071
Careful with that little thing.

01:14:39.105 --> 01:14:40.873
It might raise
a nasty bruise on me.

01:14:40.907 --> 01:14:42.742
It's your gun.

01:14:42.776 --> 01:14:44.160
You kind of look cute
with it, though.

01:14:45.545 --> 01:14:47.813
<i>Tommy, come in.</i>
<i>We have Anne-Marie.</i>

01:14:47.848 --> 01:14:50.082
<i>Repeat. We have Anne-Marie.</i>
<i>She's safe.</i>

01:14:50.116 --> 01:14:51.083
She's alive!

01:14:51.117 --> 01:14:52.134
Sienna!

01:14:57.307 --> 01:14:59.958
Sorry.

01:14:59.976 --> 01:15:03.229
Didn't see him...
I didn't see him...

01:15:03.263 --> 01:15:07.933
Officer down! Officer down!
Help me now!

01:15:12.322 --> 01:15:13.689
Anne-Marie...

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.157
She's fine, she's fine.

01:15:15.192 --> 01:15:17.643
She's safe.
She's safe.

01:15:17.661 --> 01:15:19.912
Help me!

01:15:21.648 --> 01:15:23.916
We did good.
We did good.

01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:27.336
Shh, don't talk now.
Just shush. You'll be fine.

01:15:28.755 --> 01:15:32.208
Tell them...
I did good?

01:15:32.259 --> 01:15:36.178
You did so good.
You did amazing.

01:15:36.213 --> 01:15:37.880
No, no, no, no, no!

01:15:37.931 --> 01:15:40.883
No. Wait, wait, wait!

01:15:40.934 --> 01:15:41.884
Sienna!

01:15:41.935 --> 01:15:43.552
Tommy!

01:15:43.603 --> 01:15:45.771
He stabbed her!
He came from nowhere.

01:15:45.806 --> 01:15:48.974
I couldn't do anything!

01:15:49.008 --> 01:15:50.025
Where did he go?

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:51.777
Tommy! Where did he go?

01:15:51.812 --> 01:15:54.613
That way!
He went that way!

01:15:54.648 --> 01:15:56.348
- Stay here.
- I'm gonna kill him!

01:15:56.366 --> 01:15:59.819
Do not leave her alone!

01:16:04.241 --> 01:16:07.993
Sienna... Sienna! Sienna?

01:16:17.053 --> 01:16:18.838
Anne Wilhoit.

01:16:18.872 --> 01:16:22.007
Found 28 years ago
in Central Park.

01:16:22.041 --> 01:16:23.709
Someone chased her

01:16:23.727 --> 01:16:25.478
and stabbed her
over a hundred times.

01:16:25.512 --> 01:16:26.729
You don't know
anything about her.

01:16:26.763 --> 01:16:28.097
They could never
prove it was you.

01:16:28.148 --> 01:16:30.149
You were the prime suspect,
they just couldn't close it.

01:16:30.183 --> 01:16:31.851
Why would I kill my mother?

01:16:31.885 --> 01:16:33.886
Why do guys like you
ever kill their mothers?

01:16:33.904 --> 01:16:35.020
She belittled you

01:16:35.054 --> 01:16:37.106
and made you clean your room,
do your homework.

01:16:37.157 --> 01:16:38.991
You're done now.
Don't move your hands.

01:16:39.025 --> 01:16:42.027
I'm a member of the United
States Diplomatic Corps.

01:16:42.062 --> 01:16:43.896
Put your hands
on top of your head.

01:16:43.914 --> 01:16:45.731
I have immunity!
I demand to see...

01:16:45.749 --> 01:16:47.616
- the ambassador!
- Put you hands on top of your head!

01:16:53.206 --> 01:16:54.423
You don't keep one in the pipe?

01:16:54.457 --> 01:16:56.592
They jam too much that way.

01:17:00.547 --> 01:17:03.015
I saw you in the Paris park!

01:17:03.049 --> 01:17:04.917
You're a cripple, aren't you?

01:17:06.252 --> 01:17:07.252
Damn!

01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:10.689
She liked to be called "Annie,"
not Anne.

01:17:10.724 --> 01:17:13.058
I hated that.

01:17:13.092 --> 01:17:15.945
What kind of mother
calls herself "Annie"?

01:17:15.979 --> 01:17:17.980
It's so inappropriate.

01:17:18.031 --> 01:17:19.148
Sometimes,

01:17:19.199 --> 01:17:21.817
even killing someone
doesn't shut them up.

01:17:21.868 --> 01:17:24.820
You say hello to her
for me, would ya?

01:17:37.283 --> 01:17:40.252
Let me take it.

01:17:44.057 --> 01:17:45.891
I took the shot.

01:17:45.926 --> 01:17:47.960
I took the shot.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.992
Anne-Marie, we'll
come by the hospital

01:18:03.026 --> 01:18:03.993
when we finish here.

01:18:04.027 --> 01:18:06.278
Thank you, major.

01:18:06.312 --> 01:18:09.031
I told you before,
call me Louis.

01:18:15.321 --> 01:18:16.839
Did you know
he was an American?

01:18:18.491 --> 01:18:22.327
Is that why you needed me?

01:18:22.345 --> 01:18:25.047
To avoid
the international incident?

01:18:25.098 --> 01:18:30.552
Only one person in the world
could've figured it out.

01:18:34.941 --> 01:18:36.141
Thank you.

01:18:40.897 --> 01:18:43.616
Hickman?

01:18:45.735 --> 01:18:47.403
Hickman!

01:18:48.955 --> 01:18:50.155
Would you come with me?

01:18:52.993 --> 01:18:54.960
Absolutely.

01:20:11.955 --> 01:20:14.439
George said you were back.

01:20:14.457 --> 01:20:18.410
Please. Please.
Come in.

01:20:20.413 --> 01:20:23.716
Sorry about the mess.

01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:26.668
Listen. The man
you asked me about?

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:27.886
Phillip Genovese?

01:20:27.921 --> 01:20:29.388
Yeah?

01:20:29.422 --> 01:20:30.723
He's back, too.

01:20:30.757 --> 01:20:33.258
Did he have any kids with him?

01:20:33.292 --> 01:20:35.594
I didn't see any.
Not this time.

01:20:37.897 --> 01:20:40.232
Is he staying
in the same trailer?

01:20:40.266 --> 01:20:41.800
Always.

01:20:45.739 --> 01:20:47.239
Did he do this to you?

01:20:48.942 --> 01:20:50.475
Is he the one from New York?

01:20:50.493 --> 01:20:52.244
The one you were chasing?

01:20:56.199 --> 01:20:57.833
I knew a man
like you doesn't just

01:20:57.867 --> 01:20:59.785
show up one day
to clean garbage.

01:20:59.819 --> 01:21:01.420
A man like me?

01:21:01.454 --> 01:21:03.005
A man of substance.

01:21:06.176 --> 01:21:07.709
Cleaning up garbage

01:21:07.761 --> 01:21:08.710
is something
I've always been good at.

01:21:08.762 --> 01:21:11.163
Garbage like Genovese?

01:21:11.181 --> 01:21:13.715
Just like that.

01:21:15.835 --> 01:21:17.469
Are you going to
kill him for it?

01:21:19.355 --> 01:21:20.773
No. Not for this.

01:21:23.643 --> 01:21:24.643
I never thanked you properly

01:21:24.677 --> 01:21:27.345
for coming to my defense
the other day.

01:21:27.363 --> 01:21:30.449
Not necessary.

01:21:33.153 --> 01:21:34.787
Are you sure?

01:21:48.367 --> 01:21:49.885
I'm sure.

01:21:52.806 --> 01:21:55.591
Story of my life.

01:22:23.119 --> 01:22:25.504
I'm not going to feed you.

01:22:25.538 --> 01:22:26.672
It's against the law here.

01:22:26.706 --> 01:22:29.541
Those upon who you depended
for sustenance

01:22:29.575 --> 01:22:30.843
have turned against you

01:22:30.877 --> 01:22:34.429
and deemed you a toxic blight
upon society.

01:22:35.798 --> 01:22:37.883
And that means empty bellies
for you chaps.

01:22:42.555 --> 01:22:44.556
You're talking philosophy
to pigeons.

01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:45.869
And they don't listen.

01:22:45.989 --> 01:22:50.646
Well, I'm beginning to know
how that feels.

01:22:51.814 --> 01:22:53.849
I'm sorry about
Inspector Pride.

01:22:53.883 --> 01:22:57.703
Thank you.

01:22:57.737 --> 01:23:01.039
They're not
very subtle, your team.

01:23:01.074 --> 01:23:02.708
Pictures, headlines...

01:23:02.742 --> 01:23:03.959
Everything, everywhere.

01:23:06.279 --> 01:23:08.297
An American diplomat

01:23:08.331 --> 01:23:11.917
shot and killed by
a former American policeman.

01:23:11.951 --> 01:23:13.285
Lucky you had him with you.

01:23:13.303 --> 01:23:16.088
Lucky. Yes. Very.

01:23:16.122 --> 01:23:18.056
You think of everything,
don't you, Louis?

01:23:28.067 --> 01:23:29.268
It's unopened.

01:23:29.302 --> 01:23:30.986
I can see that.

01:23:34.257 --> 01:23:36.158
You asked me about Rebecca.

01:23:38.778 --> 01:23:41.646
She's not good, you know.

01:23:45.919 --> 01:23:48.620
We may never be...

01:23:48.654 --> 01:23:49.838
I'm sorry.

01:23:49.872 --> 01:23:51.506
Go home, Louis.

01:23:51.541 --> 01:23:53.625
Be with her.

01:23:53.659 --> 01:23:55.659
Be together.

01:24:05.355 --> 01:24:07.222
You still here?

01:24:07.273 --> 01:24:10.675
So much for the wise words
of an old man.

01:24:11.811 --> 01:24:14.679
Well, maybe some old lady
will come by and feed you.

01:24:14.697 --> 01:24:17.015
Me...

01:24:17.033 --> 01:24:19.901
I have no bread.
