WEBVTT

00:00.906 --> 00:03.015
Morning, sunshine. I got us muffins.

00:03.273 --> 00:05.206
- I can't do breakfast.
- Oh, don't worry.

00:05.275 --> 00:07.442
I mashed one up and put
it in a coffee cup for you

00:07.511 --> 00:08.943
so no one'll know you're eating carbs.

00:09.012 --> 00:10.779
It's not that. Mavis just told me

00:10.847 --> 00:13.047
that I have a parent/teacher
conference this morning.

00:13.116 --> 00:14.482
Apparently, it's a mom

00:14.551 --> 00:16.384
who wants to meet just...'cause?

00:16.453 --> 00:17.886
I can do the conference for you.

00:17.954 --> 00:20.288
I can be you. Hi, I'm Ms. Snap.

00:20.357 --> 00:22.562
The only food I eat is Diet Pepsi.

00:24.523 --> 00:26.561
Yeah... I'm good.

00:26.630 --> 00:29.397
And I assure you, I can handle
any mom in that room.

00:29.466 --> 00:31.078
I'm just gonna politely explain to her

00:31.103 --> 00:32.273
that whatever the problem is,

00:32.298 --> 00:34.054
it's because her kid's an idiot.

00:35.896 --> 00:37.312
Mom?!

00:38.257 --> 00:39.382
Hi!

00:40.631 --> 00:44.421
synced and corrected by susinz
*www.addic7ed.com*

00:44.977 --> 00:46.510
What are you doing here?

00:46.579 --> 00:47.912
I haven't seen or heard from you

00:47.980 --> 00:49.446
in, like, six years.

00:49.515 --> 00:51.718
Huh. It only felt like two.

00:54.253 --> 00:57.103
Oh, do we have to send out
a missing persons report

00:57.128 --> 00:59.015
- for your sense of humor?
- I guess I lost it

00:59.040 --> 01:00.382
when you stopped calling on my birthday.

01:00.398 --> 01:03.532
Ugh. You know I don't
celebrate the aging process.

01:03.601 --> 01:07.703
Anyway, I'm here because

01:07.772 --> 01:09.705
I got married! Yeah!

01:10.375 --> 01:12.975
Now, before you go getting
your thong in a wad

01:13.000 --> 01:14.507
about not being invited,

01:14.532 --> 01:17.234
it was a really small ceremony.

01:17.259 --> 01:19.648
About 175 people.

01:20.156 --> 01:21.600
Whatever. Once you've been to four of

01:21.612 --> 01:23.226
your weddings, you've been to them all.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.726
Well, Bob, my husband,

01:25.813 --> 01:27.747
has a daughter named Stephanie,

01:27.815 --> 01:30.359
and she's in your class.
Can you believe it?

01:30.500 --> 01:31.960
I'm a mom!

01:32.039 --> 01:34.078
You've been a mom for 32 years.

01:34.094 --> 01:37.295
I know, but now I really feel like one.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.955
And I wanna get involved
with Stephie's education

01:39.980 --> 01:42.581
as much as possible... room parent,

01:42.649 --> 01:45.250
field trips, chaperone... all of it.

01:45.319 --> 01:47.296
You never did any
of this for me growing up.

01:47.321 --> 01:49.488
You never stirred my maternal instincts.

01:49.835 --> 01:50.866
No offense.

01:50.899 --> 01:52.765
- Offense taken!
- No, you can't do that.

01:52.826 --> 01:54.203
- I said no offense.
- Damn.

01:54.414 --> 01:56.561
Come to dinner tonight.

01:56.630 --> 01:59.564
Meet Bob and spend some more
time with Stephanie.

01:59.633 --> 02:01.633
Wait... is this a trap?

02:01.702 --> 02:04.469
No. I really want you to come.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.038
By the way, you look terrific, honey.

02:07.107 --> 02:10.241
I actually like you with thicker calves.

02:10.741 --> 02:11.943
Yeah!

02:16.219 --> 02:17.781
Hey, Deb! Two more acts signed up

02:17.806 --> 02:19.804
for the talent show.
This is gonna be a hoot.

02:19.829 --> 02:22.063
We'll be the best MCs
Fillmore's ever seen.

02:22.088 --> 02:23.289
Yeah. It's gonna be good.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.618
I haven't been in a talent show

02:24.686 --> 02:26.253
since my band,
Orifice and the Sphincters,

02:26.321 --> 02:28.622
got kicked out for
sexually explicit lyrics.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.991
I'm excited. I'm gonna
create an act for students

02:31.059 --> 02:32.459
who do not have what our society

02:32.527 --> 02:34.992
narrowly defines as "artistic aptitude."

02:35.273 --> 02:37.063
So their talent for the talent show

02:37.132 --> 02:38.465
is not having any talent?

02:38.533 --> 02:40.533
- Mm-hmm!
- Ugh! I'm out of foundation,

02:40.602 --> 02:42.269
and I still have Kevin James calves.

02:42.337 --> 02:43.870
- Is everything okay, Chelsea?
- No.

02:43.939 --> 02:45.272
My mom is back.

02:45.340 --> 02:47.420
Oh, wow! Meeting your mom...

02:47.445 --> 02:49.011
this is a huge step for us.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.312
Our relationship is progressing.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.437
Do you think she'll like me?

02:51.462 --> 02:53.304
You're not gonna meet her.
She's too busy

02:53.329 --> 02:56.108
with her new stepdaughter
who, bee-tee-dubs,

02:56.133 --> 02:58.334
is my student, Stephanie Harris.

02:58.402 --> 03:00.125
Stephanie is your stepsister?

03:00.188 --> 03:01.688
She just signed up for the talent show.

03:01.756 --> 03:03.723
- What is she doing?
- A mother/daughter act.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.658
Are you serious? This is the woman

03:05.727 --> 03:07.794
who left me floating
on an inflatable pizza

03:07.862 --> 03:10.396
in Lake Michigan so she could go tan.

03:10.465 --> 03:13.132
I washed ashore in Gary. Gary!

03:16.883 --> 03:19.951
Caroline and Toby reporting
for talent show sign-ups.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.620
Can you guess what we're doing?

03:21.688 --> 03:23.154
An act where you saw each other in half

03:23.223 --> 03:24.923
but it's not magic, and you both die?

03:24.992 --> 03:26.691
No, silly. We're the...

03:26.760 --> 03:28.994
Traveling Time Steps!

03:29.062 --> 03:30.862
We've been taking couples' tap lessons.

03:30.931 --> 03:33.098
And we're so excited
about performing in the show.

03:33.166 --> 03:35.467
We're in, we're in!

03:35.535 --> 03:37.035
And... slide!

03:37.104 --> 03:39.242
- Slide!
- I don't care what anyone says.

03:39.649 --> 03:41.179
Those two are related.

03:42.734 --> 03:44.667
Welcome, everyone. You're here because

03:44.736 --> 03:46.435
you think you don't have a talent.

03:46.504 --> 03:48.304
But talent is just a passion expressed.

03:48.758 --> 03:51.125
So what are you passionate about?

03:51.193 --> 03:52.293
Snakes.

03:52.361 --> 03:53.427
Pretzels.

03:53.496 --> 03:54.762
Okay! Um...

03:54.830 --> 03:56.564
those are both valid.

03:56.632 --> 03:58.699
But what are some
important issues of the day

03:58.768 --> 04:00.093
that you care about?

04:01.812 --> 04:03.604
For instance...

04:03.673 --> 04:05.539
our Earth is dying a brutal death.

04:05.564 --> 04:06.976
The Earth is dying?

04:06.998 --> 04:09.014
Yes, Sandy, I agree!

04:09.039 --> 04:10.437
Let's use this opportunity

04:10.450 --> 04:12.150
to raise awareness for global warming.

04:12.218 --> 04:13.317
What's global warming?

04:13.386 --> 04:14.664
Exactly, Marty!

04:14.689 --> 04:16.716
That's the question we need to answer!

04:16.742 --> 04:18.774
I can see it now... a bare stage

04:18.925 --> 04:21.526
except for a giant
three-dimensional Earth

04:21.594 --> 04:23.958
behind us... as we all sing about

04:23.983 --> 04:25.351
our imminent death.

04:28.535 --> 04:29.789
Wait... hold!

04:30.070 --> 04:32.703
Sugar! Did I drop my smile again?

04:32.772 --> 04:35.473
No! But your time step needs a time stop

04:35.542 --> 04:37.108
until our moves are in sync.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.010
Well, maybe if we did
the "Shuffle Off to Buffalo"

04:39.078 --> 04:41.212
like I suggested, I'd keep up better.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.814
"Shuffle Off to Buffalo"?

04:42.882 --> 04:44.682
What is this, amateur hour?

04:44.751 --> 04:47.632
Why do you get to make
all the decisions?

04:47.820 --> 04:50.521
This is just like when we tried
to redecorate the bathroom.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.023
We don't need 12 guest towels.

04:52.091 --> 04:54.492
- I like to entertain.
- We live in a studio!

04:54.561 --> 04:57.895
You have to let me
take charge sometimes!

04:59.632 --> 05:00.698
Okay.

05:00.767 --> 05:03.617
Good. I'll start now. Take five.

05:03.867 --> 05:05.233
"Take five"?

05:05.302 --> 05:08.617
What? That's how they
take a break in show biz.

05:16.286 --> 05:18.820
Remind me... how is it
you know Tanya again?

05:19.382 --> 05:20.715
I'm her daughter.

05:20.784 --> 05:22.531
That's right. That's what it was.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.367
Okay, party people,

05:24.392 --> 05:27.648
Tanya's famous meatloaf
is ready for take-off.

05:28.039 --> 05:29.625
Wait... you made dinner?

05:29.650 --> 05:32.051
- Yeah.
- Mom's a great cook.

05:32.076 --> 05:33.843
- Ohh...
- How nice.

05:33.868 --> 05:36.093
I grew up thinking
all food came out of a can.

05:36.695 --> 05:38.717
- Well...
- Okay, well...

05:38.742 --> 05:40.136
Oh! Seriously?

05:40.161 --> 05:41.827
You can't diet slap me anymore.

05:41.852 --> 05:44.867
In this family, we wait
until we say grace.

05:46.467 --> 05:47.765
Pass.

05:50.195 --> 05:52.309
You know, this reminds me of that time

05:52.378 --> 05:53.744
we all went camping to Lake...

05:53.812 --> 05:55.946
Shelbyville!

05:56.015 --> 05:58.382
Yes! And then we went
to that bizarre diner

05:58.473 --> 06:01.041
- and had the meatloaf special.
- Oh, that's right.

06:01.086 --> 06:03.086
That was fun.

06:08.525 --> 06:10.304
It sounds funny.

06:11.130 --> 06:13.764
Mom, look, I made
a smiley face with my meatloaf!

06:13.832 --> 06:16.633
Look at that! My gal is so creative!

06:17.970 --> 06:19.903
Look! I made one too.

06:20.169 --> 06:21.201
Hi!

06:21.226 --> 06:23.460
Stop it, Chelsea. You're 32.

06:23.968 --> 06:26.476
You'd never say Stephanie's
age with such disgust.

06:26.545 --> 06:28.445
I would if she was playing with her food

06:28.514 --> 06:30.289
when she was almost middle-aged.

06:30.328 --> 06:32.765
Okay. I don't have to
sit here and take this.

06:33.007 --> 06:35.118
I gave up "RuPaul's
Drag Race" to be here,

06:35.187 --> 06:37.788
and this is the last day
of my free trial on Hulu,

06:37.856 --> 06:39.765
and now I have to buy a subscription!

06:40.796 --> 06:42.718
Sashay away!

06:48.434 --> 06:50.000
So the criminal justice system

06:50.069 --> 06:52.202
provides for the detection, detainment,

06:52.271 --> 06:53.971
and punishment of criminals.

06:54.039 --> 06:57.074
And, if your cheeks look like
God personally chiseled them,

06:57.539 --> 06:59.610
after your release,
you get to be a model

06:59.678 --> 07:01.328
and date the heiress of "Topshop."

07:01.714 --> 07:02.929
Any questions?

07:04.140 --> 07:05.162
No, thanks.

07:05.187 --> 07:07.451
Ugh. If Mom was here,
she'd make you call on me.

07:07.519 --> 07:09.386
Well, Mom's not here, is she?

07:10.289 --> 07:11.722
Take out your workbooks.

07:18.273 --> 07:20.187
Hey, you can't just take my stuff!

07:20.375 --> 07:22.041
You have to ask to borrow it.

07:22.110 --> 07:23.876
- Can I borrow it?
- No.

07:23.945 --> 07:25.144
Uh-uh.

07:25.213 --> 07:27.146
It's mine! No! You have to share!

07:27.215 --> 07:28.492
- Stop!
- You stop!

07:28.543 --> 07:29.773
Give it to me!

07:29.798 --> 07:32.666
Now you broke it! I'm telling Mom!

07:35.256 --> 07:37.156
What a tattletale, am I right?

07:39.560 --> 07:42.495
Ms. Cannon, I have to
drop out of the show

07:42.563 --> 07:43.796
'cause of soccer practice.

07:43.821 --> 07:45.588
So you're choosing
an inconsequential sport

07:45.613 --> 07:47.398
over the survival of our planet?

07:47.540 --> 07:49.507
I don't know. I just go every Thursday.

07:49.532 --> 07:50.789
Fine. Go.

07:52.496 --> 07:53.765
Listen up, people.

07:53.977 --> 07:56.085
The work we're doing here matters,

07:56.110 --> 07:57.943
but we're not going to achieve our goals

07:58.012 --> 07:59.344
unless we're 100% committed.

07:59.413 --> 08:01.613
So I need you to take a moment right now

08:01.682 --> 08:03.181
to look inside yourself and decide,

08:03.250 --> 08:05.717
"Am I all in?" 'Cause if you're not,

08:05.786 --> 08:07.507
there's the door!

08:09.000 --> 08:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:17.346 --> 08:19.747
Okay. Well, Sandy,

08:20.117 --> 08:23.218
Marty, let's finish
papier-macheing the Earth.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.040
There you are, Care Bear.

08:31.640 --> 08:32.748
Guess what.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.246
Since we've had such a hard time

08:34.313 --> 08:36.347
getting the act in shape,
I've taken the bull

08:36.417 --> 08:40.052
by the horns and booked us
a practice show for today.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.365
Did you check on the space?
Did you send them a rider?

08:42.390 --> 08:44.188
We don't even have
our new character shoes!

08:44.258 --> 08:46.858
Caroline, I've taken care of everything.

08:47.210 --> 08:48.894
Okay. You're in charge.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.539
No more questions.

08:50.564 --> 08:51.976
My lips are sealed.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.162
Hey, you can't just barge into my room!

09:00.187 --> 09:01.459
Have you ever heard of knocking?

09:01.484 --> 09:04.585
Oh, why, are you making a
Ken doll go down on you again?

09:04.781 --> 09:06.210
You swore we'd never speak of that.

09:06.235 --> 09:07.585
Well, too bad!

09:07.929 --> 09:10.164
Stephanie said that you
were mean to her.

09:10.468 --> 09:12.250
What can I say? She's weak.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.886
Like it or not, you are
a part of this family,

09:14.955 --> 09:16.755
and we are going to work it out.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.690
How are we supposed to work it out?

09:18.759 --> 09:21.304
I want you to come over
for a sleepover tonight.

09:22.024 --> 09:24.658
Really? A girls' night?

09:25.992 --> 09:27.769
That sounds cool. I might... be there.

09:27.794 --> 09:28.937
I will be there.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.781
Bye, Mom.

09:31.101 --> 09:32.270
Bye, honey.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.648
I like your pants.

09:35.758 --> 09:37.491
We probably should have
measured the door

09:37.560 --> 09:38.640
before we started.

09:38.665 --> 09:41.085
You know what? Nothing's gonna stop us.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.666
That's actually a great metaphor.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.554
- Hi! Ho!
- Hey, ho.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.679
Why didn't you tell me
we were dressing up?

09:58.704 --> 10:00.445
I could have worn my mermaid hair.

10:00.476 --> 10:02.187
- Ready, babe?
- Yeah.

10:04.984 --> 10:06.078
Are you guys leaving?

10:06.103 --> 10:08.757
Yeah. We're going to see
a Def Leppard cover band.

10:08.777 --> 10:10.740
They're very accurate.
Their drummer only has

10:10.765 --> 10:11.842
- one arm too.
- Yeah.

10:11.867 --> 10:13.007
But what about girls' night?

10:13.032 --> 10:14.085
Well, girls' night

10:14.110 --> 10:16.890
- is for you and Steph, silly!
- Adios!

10:19.335 --> 10:20.765
This is my room.

10:22.617 --> 10:24.845
Do you seriously have every Adora Doll?

10:24.914 --> 10:27.514
Cottontail, Hearts Aflutter.

10:27.789 --> 10:29.585
Shut up! Sweet Cheeks?

10:30.687 --> 10:33.053
This is everything I wanted
before I discovered guys.

10:33.078 --> 10:34.476
Our mom got 'em for me.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.268
Did you have to be a certain weight?

10:36.293 --> 10:38.961
- No.
- Ugh! It's not fair!

10:39.523 --> 10:42.695
She was never there for me
the way she's there for you.

10:43.531 --> 10:44.929
I don't get it!

10:45.208 --> 10:46.710
I know how you feel.

10:47.033 --> 10:49.257
My real mom wasn't around much either.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.914
But now that Tanya's here,

10:50.939 --> 10:53.440
it's like I know how
a real mom's supposed to act.

10:53.465 --> 10:54.798
I wish I did.

10:55.434 --> 10:57.257
If it makes you feel any better,

10:57.500 --> 10:59.023
my dad's a serial cheater

10:59.048 --> 11:01.448
and will probably break our mom's heart.

11:01.874 --> 11:04.265
That does help. Thank you.

11:06.449 --> 11:07.915
Ohh...

11:08.875 --> 11:11.203
I'm sorry I was so mean to you in class.

11:11.392 --> 11:12.984
You did not deserve that.

11:13.695 --> 11:15.562
You're actually pretty cool
for a little sister.

11:15.587 --> 11:18.255
Thanks. I think you're really cool.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.398
I am.

11:19.906 --> 11:22.695
So, two cool chicks
with the house to themselves.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.359
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

11:24.384 --> 11:25.631
Let's get lit!

11:42.039 --> 11:44.261
This is why I never let you take charge.

11:44.330 --> 11:46.063
It was a mistake, Caroline.

11:46.132 --> 11:48.199
Try catastrophe!
Your shoes have a matte finish,

11:48.267 --> 11:50.334
and mine are patent leather!
Our feet are storytellers,

11:50.403 --> 11:52.103
and now they're telling
two different stories!

11:52.210 --> 11:54.205
I really don't think
it's that big of a deal.

11:54.508 --> 11:56.475
You're right. It pales in comparison

11:56.544 --> 11:58.177
to the fact that we'll be

11:58.246 --> 11:59.757
tapping on carpet!

12:05.304 --> 12:07.304
And-a one, and-a two,

12:07.329 --> 12:09.463
and-a you know what to do.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.057
Click, clack,
click, clack, clickety-clack,

12:12.126 --> 12:13.984
boom-boom! Stop making noises.

12:14.009 --> 12:16.076
Click, click, click, click.

12:16.226 --> 12:17.596
- Click, click, click.
- Don't you dare

12:17.665 --> 12:19.781
- make noises for my solo!
- And click and clack.

12:20.041 --> 12:21.828
Click, click, click, click,

12:21.933 --> 12:23.835
clickety-clack. Click, click,

12:23.860 --> 12:25.571
- clickety-clack.
- Okay, stop!

12:25.640 --> 12:26.739
- Stop it!
- Click, click, click.

12:26.807 --> 12:29.174
- Uh-oh.
- You just humiliated me

12:29.243 --> 12:30.909
at the biggest venue
we've ever performed at.

12:30.978 --> 12:33.328
That's it! I'm done!

12:33.367 --> 12:35.265
Click, click, click,
click, click, click...

12:35.290 --> 12:36.356
Stop it!

12:39.281 --> 12:41.548
Did you freeze my good water bra?

12:44.476 --> 12:46.920
- No.
- Well, it burst in the freezer.

12:46.988 --> 12:48.755
Now what am I supposed to
wear to church?

12:48.824 --> 12:50.356
Relax. It was a prank.

12:50.425 --> 12:51.624
Sorry, Mom.

12:51.693 --> 12:54.162
No. This is all you, Chelsea.

12:54.187 --> 12:56.062
You are a horrible influence.

12:56.265 --> 12:58.781
Stephanie never would
have done this without you.

12:59.125 --> 13:01.218
Oh, you're such a disappointment.

13:07.142 --> 13:08.942
Ugh. I hate Amber Alerts.

13:09.010 --> 13:10.510
What do they want me to do,
put on a cape

13:10.579 --> 13:11.845
and go find the kid?

13:11.913 --> 13:13.546
Maybe we shouldn't have pranked Mom.

13:13.615 --> 13:15.815
Yeah. She was really mad.

13:15.884 --> 13:17.817
I've never seen her
forehead move before.

13:20.059 --> 13:21.213
Crap.

13:21.238 --> 13:23.304
Haven't paid parking
tickets in ten years.

13:24.603 --> 13:27.170
How much do I owe? I'll Venmo you.

13:27.195 --> 13:28.928
- Hands up!
- Aah!

13:28.996 --> 13:30.629
Aah!

13:30.698 --> 13:32.812
Your vehicle's the subject
of an Amber Alert.

13:32.837 --> 13:34.607
We're placing you under
arrest for kidnapping.

13:34.632 --> 13:36.890
What? She's my stepsister!

13:36.915 --> 13:38.460
I'm gonna read you your Miranda rights.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.719
Well, I'm Chelsea, not Miranda,

13:40.744 --> 13:42.734
so why would you read me her rights?

13:46.148 --> 13:47.581
Thank you so much for finding them.

13:47.649 --> 13:49.583
I'm sorry about the false alarm.

13:54.390 --> 13:55.589
I can't believe you did that.

13:55.657 --> 13:57.154
You got what you deserved.

13:57.179 --> 13:59.289
- You are unbelievable!
- Yeah.

13:59.314 --> 14:01.756
My whole life, all I've ever done

14:01.781 --> 14:02.896
is try to make you happy.

14:04.164 --> 14:05.585
But it's never enough.

14:06.180 --> 14:07.867
I celebrated my tenth birthday

14:07.892 --> 14:10.359
five years in a row
so you wouldn't feel old.

14:10.782 --> 14:11.796
Not enough.

14:11.821 --> 14:14.101
I slept in the yard
when you brought guys home

14:14.126 --> 14:15.609
because you said having
a kid in the house

14:15.634 --> 14:16.900
made them uncomfortable.

14:17.043 --> 14:18.242
Not enough!

14:18.843 --> 14:21.445
I broke up with my college boyfriend

14:21.470 --> 14:23.265
because you guys had chemistry!

14:23.330 --> 14:26.351
Not enough!
Then I even bond with Stephanie

14:26.617 --> 14:28.242
who you're doing all this stuff for

14:28.267 --> 14:29.812
that you never did for me.

14:30.742 --> 14:32.218
Why am I not enough?

14:33.913 --> 14:35.484
I don't know what to say.

14:37.466 --> 14:38.851
You don't have to say anything.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.526
I never wanna see you again.

14:42.294 --> 14:45.161
W-wh... Wait, no! Chelsea!

14:45.186 --> 14:48.254
Wait. I know I was a terrible mom.

14:48.883 --> 14:50.718
So when Stephanie came along,

14:50.743 --> 14:53.273
I just figured this
maybe my chance to...

14:53.360 --> 14:54.531
get it right?

14:55.473 --> 14:59.296
But you should know
that I'm very proud of you.

15:00.622 --> 15:02.356
I mean, look at you.

15:03.104 --> 15:05.632
You're a smart, successful,

15:05.657 --> 15:06.851
skinny teacher,

15:06.962 --> 15:09.096
and you did it all on your own.

15:09.562 --> 15:10.828
Oh, my God.

15:11.635 --> 15:13.068
Did you just call me skinny?

15:13.510 --> 15:14.968
Like Nicole Richie.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.781
I love you, Mom.

15:16.806 --> 15:18.421
I love you, Chels.

15:18.923 --> 15:20.507
Oh!

15:26.570 --> 15:28.069
I hate playing violin.

15:28.677 --> 15:29.921
Oh!

15:31.546 --> 15:34.406
Well, that was a quick act, folks.

15:34.703 --> 15:37.279
I thought he might string us along.

15:37.796 --> 15:40.715
I'm glad he didn't. People
might have gotten violin... t.

15:41.578 --> 15:42.884
Hold for laughs.

15:44.953 --> 15:47.467
Okay! Without further ado,

15:47.492 --> 15:49.092
please welcome to the stage

15:49.117 --> 15:51.192
The Traveling Time Steps!

15:51.261 --> 15:53.828
- There's only one now.
- What? There's...

15:53.897 --> 15:56.498
- The Traveling Time...
- Step!

16:26.078 --> 16:27.271
Sorry.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.271
Oh!

16:54.414 --> 16:55.557
That was top notch.

16:55.625 --> 16:57.273
I'll bet I know what those guys drank.

16:57.869 --> 16:59.201
What's that?

16:59.820 --> 17:01.207
Tap water.

17:01.244 --> 17:03.195
Make eye contact with the audience...

17:05.625 --> 17:08.803

Oh...

18:28.289 --> 18:29.655
Oh!

18:33.594 --> 18:35.215
Thanks for doing the show with me.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.457
Of course.

18:36.527 --> 18:39.004
I'm sorry for quitting
The Traveling Time Steps.

18:39.267 --> 18:41.660
And you were right about
the "Shuffle Off to Buffalo."

18:41.685 --> 18:44.285
It is not an amateur move.

18:47.770 --> 18:48.941
What's wrong?

18:49.176 --> 18:50.842
Listen, Care Bear,

18:51.348 --> 18:53.160
you mean the world to me,

18:53.995 --> 18:56.754
but I think we both know
this isn't working.

18:58.129 --> 19:00.793
Toblerone, are you breaking up with me?

19:03.457 --> 19:04.890
I know we've been fighting a lot,

19:04.959 --> 19:06.895
but I'm not myself. I'm worried about

19:06.920 --> 19:08.332
my financial situation...

19:08.357 --> 19:10.791
It's not just you. It's me too.

19:12.012 --> 19:14.410
I think we're both having a hard time

19:14.864 --> 19:16.702
accommodating each other.

19:17.341 --> 19:19.274
I'll stop watching
"The Property Brothers."

19:19.343 --> 19:20.637
I don't even find them that attractive.

19:20.662 --> 19:24.082
I'm a man, Caroline, but I have eyes.

19:24.107 --> 19:26.489
Those two are Greek gods,
and you and I both know it.

19:26.672 --> 19:28.205
Yeah.

19:30.850 --> 19:32.684
So is this really it?

19:33.166 --> 19:34.799
I think it is.

19:44.951 --> 19:48.121
Uh... we carpooled this morning.

19:48.924 --> 19:51.125
Can I still get a ride?

19:51.871 --> 19:54.809
Uh... I think it's probably
best if you get a Lyft.

19:55.459 --> 19:56.614
Okay.
