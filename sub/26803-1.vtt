Michael, your son
has a bruise on face.

12:05.863 --> 12:07.796
- He was playing
football in gym class.

12:07.830 --> 12:08.797
- Football?

12:08.831 --> 12:10.315
- Yeah, football.

12:10.350 --> 12:12.352
- Michael, you know
that's not true.

12:12.386 --> 12:14.112
- Why would he lie?

12:14.147 --> 12:15.804
If there was really a
problem going on in school,

12:15.838 --> 12:18.323
he would talk to us about it.

12:18.358 --> 12:19.324
I mean, he did it before.

12:19.359 --> 12:20.670
- Yeah,

12:20.705 --> 12:23.432
when his father
didn't pressure him to

12:23.466 --> 12:25.814
be something that he's not.

12:25.848 --> 12:27.263
- [Michael] Oh, so
this is my fault?

12:27.298 --> 12:28.644
- Who else, Michael?

12:28.678 --> 12:30.370
He worships the ground
that you walk on.

12:30.404 --> 12:31.233
- Oh!

12:32.855 --> 12:33.718
Wow.

12:35.064 --> 12:37.791
Look, is it wrong for a
father to want his son

12:37.826 --> 12:39.137
to be more active?

12:39.172 --> 12:42.554
- No, but could you just be
a little bit more easygoing?

12:42.589 --> 12:43.659
- Easygoing?

12:43.693 --> 12:44.487
- [Jessica] Yes.

12:44.522 --> 12:45.419
- Oh, you want me
to be easygoing?

12:45.454 --> 12:46.351
- [Jessica] Yes.

12:46.386 --> 12:48.319
- He's a teenager, not a puppy.

12:48.353 --> 12:50.045
Alright, he got more
things to think about

12:50.079 --> 12:54.152
than being cradled by his
mom every five minutes.

13:00.365 --> 13:01.401
- Bro.

13:01.435 --> 13:02.264
Tell me.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.129
How'd it go with Kali?

13:05.163 --> 13:07.269
- No, no, you don't wanna...

13:07.303 --> 13:08.132
- Let me guess.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.064
She couldn't get
past the black eye.

13:09.098 --> 13:09.927
- Ow.

13:10.859 --> 13:13.309
Okay, first off,
I'll have you know

13:13.344 --> 13:16.381
that Kali Winbrook,
the prettiest girl

13:16.416 --> 13:18.832
invited me to her mom's
tent at the festival.

13:18.867 --> 13:20.178
- You?

13:20.213 --> 13:21.835
Bro, no way.

13:21.870 --> 13:23.561
The way you making
it seem, it's like,

13:23.595 --> 13:26.219
you had a dope conversation.

13:26.253 --> 13:28.083
What y'all talk about?

13:29.015 --> 13:32.466
- Okay, well like,
everything was dope but like,

13:32.501 --> 13:33.847
Lance showed up.

13:33.882 --> 13:35.676
- [Christopher] Hold up, Lance?

13:35.711 --> 13:36.850
- [Kevin] Yeah.

13:36.885 --> 13:38.507
- [Christopher] The Lance?

13:38.541 --> 13:40.405
The same Lance who
gave you the black eye?

13:40.440 --> 13:41.682
- [Kevin] Yeah.

13:41.717 --> 13:42.718
- [Christopher] The Lance
who pulled my pants down--

13:42.752 --> 13:44.306
- [Kevin] Yes, yes, yes.

13:44.340 --> 13:45.341
- [Christopher] The Lance who--

13:45.376 --> 13:46.066
- [Kevin] The Lance that
that glued Miss Dorman's

13:46.101 --> 13:47.240
shoes to the floor, yes, Lance.

13:47.274 --> 13:48.413
- Yeah, but he's been
bullying everybody

13:48.448 --> 13:50.001
since he got to this school.

13:50.036 --> 13:52.038
- Hey, if it isn't Eric.

13:53.349 --> 13:56.421
Money man, what's good, man?

13:56.456 --> 13:57.733
- I don't have it, Lance.

13:57.767 --> 13:59.942
My mom didn't give me
my allowance this week.

13:59.977 --> 14:02.772
- Eric, you know it's not
good to lie to me, right?

14:02.807 --> 14:04.878
- But I really don't have it.

14:04.913 --> 14:05.810
- Yo, guys.

14:06.673 --> 14:08.468
How do we feel about liars?

14:08.502 --> 14:10.056
- [Stanley] We hate
'em, can't stand 'em.

14:10.090 --> 14:11.816
- How do we deal with 'em?

14:11.851 --> 14:14.612
- So, what does
he want with you?

14:17.201 --> 14:20.273
- For me to stay away from her.

14:20.307 --> 14:21.930
- So, basically bro, you
gotta do what he says

14:21.964 --> 14:23.034
and stay away from her.

14:23.069 --> 14:24.725
- No, why would I do that?

14:24.760 --> 14:26.244
- Because if you
don't, then I'm gone.

14:26.279 --> 14:27.073
- Okay.

14:27.107 --> 14:28.177
- And we all know that.

14:28.212 --> 14:29.385
That's not hot.

14:29.420 --> 14:31.353
- Okay, but yo, but I think
she really likes me, bro.

14:31.387 --> 14:32.354
Like it's--

14:32.388 --> 14:33.838
- Yeah, she may like
you, but she loves me.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.770
- Hey guys.

14:35.978 --> 14:38.878
- [Christopher] Yo, yo,
yo, what's good, Kali?

14:38.912 --> 14:41.846
- Hey Kevin, sorry about
what Lance did earlier.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.537
He can be such a jerk sometimes.

14:43.572 --> 14:44.676
- [All] Oohh!

14:48.335 --> 14:50.027
- How are you doing in
Miss Graham's class?

14:50.061 --> 14:51.821
You know we have
a test coming up.

14:51.856 --> 14:54.894
- Yeah, and her tests are
always the hardest, yup.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.482
- Alright, you can go, brother.

14:58.967 --> 14:59.864
Bye.

14:59.899 --> 15:00.692
[chuckling]

15:00.727 --> 15:02.867
[mumbling]

15:02.902 --> 15:04.558
- Yeah, I was actually
thinking about studying

15:04.593 --> 15:06.146
in the library later.

15:06.181 --> 15:09.046
Maybe you can join me,
be my study partner?

15:09.080 --> 15:10.150
- [Both] Yeah.

15:10.185 --> 15:11.911
- [Christopher] Yeah,
we will, we will

15:11.945 --> 15:13.809
definitely be there, for sure.

15:13.843 --> 15:14.637
Thank you.

15:14.672 --> 15:15.466
- Yeah.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.294
- Okay, sounds good.

15:16.329 --> 15:18.607
[giggling]

15:20.160 --> 15:22.404
- Peace out, Kali.

15:22.438 --> 15:24.337
- What does this
clown think he doing?

15:24.371 --> 15:27.271
[tense beat music]

15:30.032 --> 15:32.897
[thudding]

15:32.932 --> 15:33.967
- Pick it up.

15:35.348 --> 15:36.142
- [Kid] Pick it up, you deaf?

15:36.176 --> 15:37.246
- Pick it up.

15:43.149 --> 15:44.667
[mumbling]

15:44.702 --> 15:45.599
- Trashy day.

15:45.634 --> 15:46.946
What is up?

15:46.980 --> 15:49.914
[tense beat music]

15:51.812 --> 15:53.124
- Yo, can you just
leave us alone, man?

15:53.159 --> 15:56.921
[all talking over each other]

15:56.956 --> 15:58.371
- Y'all shut up.

15:58.405 --> 16:01.305
[tense beat music]

16:04.998 --> 16:05.792
Yeah, alright man.

16:05.826 --> 16:06.758
You can go.

16:14.456 --> 16:16.734
[thudding]

16:20.151 --> 16:22.498
- [Kevin] There's only
so much I can take.

16:22.533 --> 16:24.638
Being pushed around, embarrassed

16:24.673 --> 16:27.158
in front of the entire school.

16:28.332 --> 16:30.782
It's enough to make you want
to end it all, you know?

16:30.817 --> 16:32.025
- [Principal] What's
going on, here?

16:32.060 --> 16:33.026
- [Lance] Principal
Evans, I promise,

16:33.061 --> 16:34.062
we was just helping him up.

16:34.096 --> 16:36.547
- Don't try to pull a
fast on me, Mr. Fields.

16:36.581 --> 16:38.652
I saw what just went on here.

16:38.687 --> 16:41.379
We have zero tolerance
for this type of behavior.

16:41.414 --> 16:43.278
You are to report to
my office immediately.

16:43.312 --> 16:44.106
- But I was just--

16:44.141 --> 16:46.384
- Now, Mr. Fields!

16:46.419 --> 16:48.731
[bell ringing]

16:48.766 --> 16:51.148
[chattering]

16:59.880 --> 17:00.812
Mr. Fields.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.367
It's the third time
this week I caught you

17:03.401 --> 17:07.060
stirring up trouble
with the other students.

17:07.095 --> 17:10.339
Now, what do you have
to say for yourself?

17:10.374 --> 17:11.789
- I mean, I'm obviously just not

17:11.823 --> 17:14.032
the luckiest guy in the world.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.345
- Son, I'd suggest you
take this very seriously.

17:16.380 --> 17:18.070
This is your third offense,

17:18.106 --> 17:18.934
and I don't think
you're gonna be

17:18.968 --> 17:21.349
real happy with
the repercussions.

17:21.385 --> 17:22.523
- What is it?

17:22.558 --> 17:24.387
Three days of
after-school detention

17:24.422 --> 17:27.079
or as we like to call it,
after-school lunching.

17:27.115 --> 17:28.047
[chuckling]

17:28.080 --> 17:29.048
- Oh no, Mr. Fields.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.498
You've abused all of
your detention rights.

17:31.533 --> 17:36.089
I got something extra
special in mind for you.

17:36.124 --> 17:37.918
- And what is this?

17:37.953 --> 17:39.920
- Three day out of
school suspension.

17:39.955 --> 17:40.818
You've earned it well.

17:40.852 --> 17:41.888
- Sweet.

17:41.922 --> 17:43.200
Three days of vacation.

17:43.234 --> 17:44.615
What more could a kid ask for?

17:44.649 --> 17:45.754
[chuckling]

17:45.788 --> 17:46.962
- Is that right?

17:46.996 --> 17:49.999
I'm sure your father
would disagree.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.693
[phone ringing]

17:53.727 --> 17:54.521
Yes, Mandy.

17:54.556 --> 17:57.110
Get me Mr. Fields on the phone.

18:08.949 --> 18:10.537
- Yeah.

18:10.572 --> 18:13.230
Please, get that
done for me, okay?

18:13.264 --> 18:15.577
Alright, okay, thanks.

18:15.611 --> 18:17.096
Bye.

18:17.130 --> 18:17.924
Hey Miller.

18:17.958 --> 18:19.201
- [Michael] Yeah?

18:19.236 --> 18:21.583
- This came for you.

18:21.617 --> 18:24.413
A few of the rookies were
going through the storage room.

18:24.448 --> 18:27.209
Found some of
Molly's old things.

18:30.523 --> 18:31.351
Yeah?

18:41.775 --> 18:44.675
[melancholy music]

18:47.781 --> 18:49.818
- [Molly] February 14th.

18:49.852 --> 18:52.372
He's always smiling at me.

18:52.407 --> 18:57.066
Makes me question the
life I now have with Ben.

18:57.101 --> 18:59.793
He's so charming
and the fact that

18:59.828 --> 19:02.382
he's my partner
doesn't help, either.

19:02.417 --> 19:04.108
- We're out here risking
our lives every day

19:04.143 --> 19:06.628
and then you gotta go home
and act like nothing happened.

19:06.662 --> 19:09.562
- Yeah, Benjamin's the same way.

19:09.596 --> 19:12.151
He thinks cops are a liability.

19:16.638 --> 19:18.260
- [Child] Mommy, Mommy,
can I have a lollipop?

19:18.295 --> 19:19.088
- No, baby.

19:19.123 --> 19:20.020
- [Child] Please, please?

19:20.055 --> 19:20.849
- I said no.

19:20.883 --> 19:21.677
- Here you go.

19:21.712 --> 19:24.680
- Thank you, I love this store!

19:24.715 --> 19:28.132
- All he talks about
is his precious school.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.651
- There wouldn't be no
schools if there weren't

19:29.685 --> 19:33.068
good cops out here
doing their job.

19:33.102 --> 19:35.588
[tense music]

19:42.560 --> 19:43.561
- [Dispatcher] Adam 22.

19:43.596 --> 19:46.012
Possible 2-1-1 in
progress at Mill's Market,

19:46.046 --> 19:48.394
720 West Owens Avenue.

19:48.428 --> 19:50.465
Suspects are driving
an all-white sedan.

19:50.499 --> 19:55.504
- [Molly] Copy that, Adam 22
responding to possible suspect.

19:59.888 --> 20:02.546
[siren blaring]

20:13.315 --> 20:14.454
Freeze!

20:14.489 --> 20:17.008
[tense music]

20:57.946 --> 20:58.912
Freeze!

20:58.947 --> 21:01.674
- [Robber] Drop
that fucking gun.

21:03.952 --> 21:05.919
[gunshots popping]

21:05.954 --> 21:07.887
[siren blaring]

21:07.921 --> 21:10.855
[tense beat music]

21:43.267 --> 21:44.924
- You don't have to
do this, alright?

21:44.958 --> 21:45.959
She has nothing to do with this.

21:45.994 --> 21:47.306
Just drop the knife.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.273
I said put the knife down!

21:49.308 --> 21:50.861
- [Robber] Drop it!

21:53.484 --> 21:54.382
Drop it!

21:54.416 --> 21:55.555
- Alright.

21:55.590 --> 21:56.556
- [Robber] Drop it!

21:56.591 --> 21:57.385
- Alright.

21:57.419 --> 21:58.247
- [Robber] Now!

21:58.282 --> 21:59.076
- Alright!

21:59.110 --> 22:00.042
[tense music]

22:00.077 --> 22:01.285
I'm gonna drop it.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.080
Just don't hurt her, alright?

22:03.114 --> 22:05.358
[mumbling]

22:10.881 --> 22:12.400
- [Robber] Take a step back.

22:12.434 --> 22:15.334
[tense beat music]

22:20.097 --> 22:20.891
- Get down.

22:20.925 --> 22:22.755
Get the fuck down, right now.

22:22.789 --> 22:24.170
Get on the fucking floor!

22:24.204 --> 22:25.033
Get!

22:26.621 --> 22:28.657
You got the right to remain
silent mother fucker.

22:28.692 --> 22:29.693
Made me run!

22:33.524 --> 22:34.870
- Jesus Christ.

22:34.905 --> 22:38.460
What were you two
thinking about out there?

22:40.773 --> 22:43.362
I.A. is all over
my ass about this.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.467
- Sir, the suspects
were getting away.

22:45.502 --> 22:47.262
Now, we tried our best to
minimize the situation--

22:47.296 --> 22:50.058
- Minimize the situation?

22:50.092 --> 22:51.784
That punk had a
knife to a kid's head

22:51.818 --> 22:54.373
and you call that
minimizing the situation?

22:54.407 --> 22:56.927
- Sir, if you
would just let me--

22:56.961 --> 22:59.274
- I don't understand how
you two could be so sloppy.

22:59.308 --> 23:00.689
- With all due respect, sir--

23:00.724 --> 23:02.173
- Save that shit, Michael.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.210
There's nothing you two
can say to me about this.

23:04.244 --> 23:05.729
My hands are tied.

23:11.873 --> 23:13.944
This don't make no sense.
