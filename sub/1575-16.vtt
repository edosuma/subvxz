all over town for you.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.375
She's the love of my life,

03:06.458 --> 03:08.542
but good grief,
can she be a handful.

03:08.625 --> 03:10.458
Every single day,
I get out of bed

03:10.542 --> 03:11.834
and sing my good morning song

03:11.917 --> 03:14.792
so that I can face the coming
workday with gusto, zest,

03:14.875 --> 03:16.917
and most importantly,
of course, verve.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.583
And all I ask of you is --

03:18.667 --> 03:20.000
Geez, Roger, you sure
you don't want to get

03:20.083 --> 03:21.417
that thing on your head
checked out?

03:21.500 --> 03:23.500
What, this?
I told you. It's nothing.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.542
Look, I'm sorry I flaked
on your little song,

03:25.625 --> 03:27.667
but I've been feeling
a little sluggish lately.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.375
Probably because
you're goofing off all the time

03:29.458 --> 03:30.750
doing your "personas."

03:30.834 --> 03:32.083
Goofing off?

03:32.166 --> 03:34.583
I'll have you know I got up
at 4:30 this morning

03:34.667 --> 03:35.750
to get into character

03:35.834 --> 03:38.375
as Russian banana inspector
Olladouis Goofoff.

03:38.458 --> 03:40.208
Does that sound like goofing off
to you?

03:40.291 --> 03:42.625
I never flake on you,
and I have a real job.

03:42.709 --> 03:43.917
What I do matters.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.333
What I do matters, too!

03:45.417 --> 03:46.834
Oh, right, it really matters

03:46.917 --> 03:48.875
whether or not you run around
all day blowing guys.

03:48.959 --> 03:52.417
That is only a very large part
of what I do.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.625
People depend on my personas,
Stan.

03:54.709 --> 03:55.875
It might not seem like it,

03:55.959 --> 03:58.458

to join the swing choir.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.375

to Pearl Bailey,

to join Jazzma Attack.

Well, we're going to be
counting on

04:41.709 --> 04:44.959
that mile-a-minute mouth magic
of yours at the state finals.

04:45.041 --> 04:46.917
Now hit the showers, maggots!

04:53.291 --> 04:55.917
Are you doing drugs?!

04:56.000 --> 05:00.291
I'm doing what it takes
for Jazzma Attack to succeed.

05:00.375 --> 05:01.959
You gotta juice that scat speed

05:02.041 --> 05:04.083
if you want to compete
at a state level.

05:04.166 --> 05:05.583
And you better take 'em,
too, kid,

05:05.667 --> 05:07.500
unless you're not
truly committed to swing choir.

05:07.583 --> 05:08.500
Easy, Tyler.

05:08.583 --> 05:10.834
As the old saw goes,
you can lead a horse to water,

05:10.917 --> 05:12.166
but you can't make him drink.

05:12.250 --> 05:13.250
Well put, Marcus.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.041
Get with the program, Smith.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.959
Even your buddy Barry
is mainlining testosterone

05:21.041 --> 05:23.959
to get that boomin'
bassy baritone.

05:24.041 --> 05:25.834
Shh.

05:25.917 --> 05:29.041
Nobody tell.

05:31.625 --> 05:34.709
Wait.
The dog's name is Marmaduke?

05:35.792 --> 05:36.917
'Sup, my ninjas?!

05:37.000 --> 05:37.959

05:38.041 --> 05:39.250
Oh, my God!

05:39.333 --> 05:41.166
Do you want me to call you
an ambulance?

05:41.250 --> 05:44.041
Why? Planning on making
that meat loaf of yours tonight?

05:44.125 --> 05:45.917
Man.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.792
Roger, you have a tumor
on your head.

05:47.875 --> 05:48.959
You need to see a doctor.

05:49.041 --> 05:50.709
What? Why?!
I'm fine.

05:50.792 --> 05:53.041
Plus, I just have so much to do.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.959
Alexa, what's left
on my schedule for today?

05:56.041 --> 05:57.125
You have a 3:15

05:57.208 --> 05:58.834
as traveling nurse
DeAndre Comadendo.

05:58.917 --> 05:59.875
Then after that --

05:59.959 --> 06:02.625
Klaus?
Did you hollow out Roger's Echo?

06:02.709 --> 06:05.417
What?! No way!
I'm not Klaus.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.041
It's me, Alexa, bro!

06:07.125 --> 06:11.333
Alexa, who was the fourth
emperor of the Ming Dynasty?

06:11.417 --> 06:12.583
Um...

06:12.667 --> 06:16.125
Chickety-China,
the...Chinese chicken?

06:16.208 --> 06:18.166
Huh.
That could be right.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.333
Who's scorching
all that copper wire?

06:21.417 --> 06:22.875
Smells great.

06:22.959 --> 06:24.417
Roger, listen to me.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.083
You need to go
to a doctor right now!

06:26.166 --> 06:27.166
You could be dying!

06:27.250 --> 06:30.667
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz.
That's you.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.959
Well, on you catch
the side flip.

06:35.750 --> 06:38.291
What happened?

06:38.375 --> 06:40.291
Roger, you almost died.

06:40.375 --> 06:43.083
We got you to Dr. Kalgary
in just the nick of time.

06:43.166 --> 06:45.625
Yes, one scant moment longer,

06:45.709 --> 06:48.917
and this festering
mass of disease

06:49.000 --> 06:53.750
would surely have claimed
your soul for the damned.

06:53.834 --> 06:55.917
By the way, can I offer you
a La Croix or something?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.625
Billy!
Get our guest a La Croix!

07:00.083 --> 07:03.000
There's no cold ones!

07:03.083 --> 07:05.709
What?! Why didn't you put
any in earlier?!

07:05.792 --> 07:08.542
You left an empty case in here!

07:08.625 --> 07:11.792
I don't have X-ray vision!

07:11.875 --> 07:14.125
Yes, you do, Billy!

07:14.208 --> 07:17.458
Billy, sometimes you just
make me so mad!

07:17.542 --> 07:19.041
-Can I keep that?
-Sure!

07:19.125 --> 07:21.000
Whoop!
Don't try to get up.

07:21.083 --> 07:23.667
You're in an extremely
fragile state.

07:23.750 --> 07:28.000
You'll need absolute rest
and relaxation for several days!

07:28.083 --> 07:31.041
Anything we can do to help while
you recover, Roger, we'll do it.

07:31.125 --> 07:32.375
Right, Stan?

07:32.458 --> 07:34.500
Absolutely anything.
Just name it.

07:34.583 --> 07:39.417
Good, because Stan, I need you
to take over my personas.

07:39.500 --> 07:44.041
Oh-h-h-h-h-h, shi-i-i-i-i-i-t!

07:49.125 --> 07:51.291
Stan, thanks again
for taking time off from work

07:51.375 --> 07:52.542
to cover my personas.

07:52.625 --> 07:54.792
It'll really put my mind at ease
while I'm convalescing

07:54.875 --> 07:56.959
at the famed
Chimdale Hot Springs.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.291
My cousin committed
suicide there.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.917
It's beautiful.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.291
All of my personas
are of crucial importance.

08:04.375 --> 08:06.458
Messing up
even the tiniest detail

08:06.542 --> 08:08.333
could have
disastrous consequences.

08:08.417 --> 08:09.792
Uh-huh.
Tiniest detail. Got it.

08:09.875 --> 08:12.000
Now, before you put on
any of my costumes,

08:12.083 --> 08:15.125
you'll first need to get
into this alien-skin body suit.

08:15.208 --> 08:16.625
It hides who you really are

08:16.709 --> 08:18.625
so the personas
are all that people see.

08:18.709 --> 08:19.709
Right. Right. Cool.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.792
Oh, and stay out of this box
over here.

08:21.875 --> 08:24.458

08:33.667 --> 08:35.166
Stan, are you paying attention?

08:35.250 --> 08:36.417
Yeah. Roger, I got it.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.208
I'm gonna put on
a stupid gray suit,

08:38.291 --> 08:39.417
dance around like an idiot,

08:39.500 --> 08:41.125

on your dumb list.

08:41.208 --> 08:42.458
Technically, that's correct,

08:42.542 --> 08:44.250
but I'm not liking
your attitude.

08:44.333 --> 08:46.000
You're not taking this
seriously.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.250
I guess I'll just have to stay
and do it myself.

08:49.959 --> 08:52.041
Careful, Roger!
Geez!

08:52.125 --> 08:54.000
All right. I promise
I'll take it seriously.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.500
Okay.
Then I'm off.

08:55.583 --> 08:58.125
Be a doll and hand me my tumor.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.542
I've gotten kind of attached
to it.

08:59.625 --> 09:01.834

Rogu!

09:01.917 --> 09:03.041
Isn't he cute?

09:03.125 --> 09:05.083
Kiss him.
Come on! Kiss him!

09:05.166 --> 09:07.125
I'm not leaving
till you give him a little kiss.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.959
-I will not kiss him.
-Well, then I'll kiss him.

09:10.041 --> 09:13.417
Now if you kiss me,
it'll be like you kissed him.

09:17.375 --> 09:19.667

are taking...

This is extremely disturbing
news, Smith.

09:35.750 --> 09:38.875
When it comes to drugs, I have
a zero-tolerance policy --

09:38.959 --> 09:40.250
for not taking them!

09:41.917 --> 09:46.667
Was your desk...

or you don't take the stage.
