Ivy, (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
you don't have to do this.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.806
Oh, I am doing it.

00:14.889 --> 00:17.475
I've been hiding out
in the woods way too long.

00:17.559 --> 00:21.938
I've got to rinse off this old baggage,
right through this ridiculous car wash.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.524
Hey, mister, is this thing even safe?

00:24.649 --> 00:27.360
It's a perfectly safe revitalization,

00:27.444 --> 00:30.447
with a squirt of minty freshness
to brighten your day.

00:30.530 --> 00:34.617

00:48.757 --> 00:51.384
Look at you! How do you feel?

00:51.468 --> 00:53.261
Brand new and ready to roll.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.180
Well, what about me?

00:57.766 --> 00:59.392
Can't mess with perfection.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.006
A whole lot of nothing out here.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.800
Nothing? Are you kidding?

01:31.883 --> 01:35.136
Speaking as a one-time hermit,
I'm ready to soak it all up.

01:35.220 --> 01:39.307
Blue skies, green fields,
and new experiences.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.392
See everything with fresh eyes.

01:41.476 --> 01:45.271
(GASPS) She's right.
We've gone numb to the simple pleasures.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.564
What have we become?

01:46.648 --> 01:48.733
What? Me? Numb? Jaded?

01:48.817 --> 01:51.611
Hey, I celebrate life's simple pleasures.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.613
I appreciate... Oh, jeez, it's a circus.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.698

Come on. They're just
plain adorable, is all.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.423
-Whoa.
-(SIGHS)

02:53.506 --> 02:56.217
You will tremble before
feats of derring-do,

02:56.301 --> 03:00.221
gasp at impossible strength,
followed by cheers and...

03:00.305 --> 03:02.724
Wait. You'll cheer first, then, um...

03:02.807 --> 03:06.227
Now, sit back! Shut up...

03:06.311 --> 03:10.190
And behold the greatness!

Come on, babe. We finally get an audience

-Oh, did you see that?
-Oh, yeah.

04:05.286 --> 04:07.622
You know, I think
I'm just gonna wait out front.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.748
That ain't polite.

Oh, whoa. No, no, no, no.
What is she doing?

05:29.912 --> 05:32.957
(GASPS) Monster trucks
tend to do one thing,

05:33.041 --> 05:36.419
and that's smush everything in their path.

I don't know how to explain it.
It just feels right here.

-Gonna miss you guys.

the beginning of something great.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.263
Hey, you know what we should do?

07:10.346 --> 07:11.764
Once we're done with the wedding,

we should come back again,
see how she's doing.

decide right now, right?
