01:06.816 --> 01:07.650
No!

01:08.026 --> 01:09.944
Paladins, brace for impact.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.030
Hunk, help me with Shiro.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.933
Hunk, get Shiro to the Atlas.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.392
-We'll cover you.
-Got it.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.836
That energy spectrum
completely deflected our attack!

02:13.383 --> 02:14.676
We got it from here.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.220
Shiro is aboard the Atlas.

02:46.749 --> 02:49.377
Keith, we got you covered.
Get out of there!

02:50.128 --> 02:52.881
Anyone have any idea
where this thing came from?

02:53.047 --> 02:53.923
No clue.

03:01.639 --> 03:05.852
We just defeated
an entire Galra armada, and now this?

03:05.935 --> 03:06.853
Paladins...

03:07.353 --> 03:09.022
I know we're all in bad shape...

03:09.606 --> 03:11.316
but we have strength together.

03:12.025 --> 03:12.984
This is Earth.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.652
This is our home.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.696
We're going to defend it.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.032
And we'll be by your side!

03:22.452 --> 03:24.370
Good to have you back, Atlas.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.087
We've taken a direct hit.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.881
It's aligning for a second attack.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.385
-I need to get back.
-But, Commander...

03:42.347 --> 03:45.016
Atlas, we need you to hold
the beast back temporarily

03:45.099 --> 03:46.684
so we have time to form Voltron.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.686
It's the only way
we're gonna beat this thing.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.729
Affirmative.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.315
Paladins, let's finish this fight.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.162
Coran, what's our next move?

04:06.246 --> 04:09.332
Oh! This ship is so different
from the Castle of Lions.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.750
I... uh--

04:10.833 --> 04:12.210
Coran, hold course.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.379
Oh, thank the ancients you're here.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.798
-Captain, are you okay?
-I'll be fine.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.132
Shields report.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.466
They're at 70 percent!

04:21.511 --> 04:24.472
-Iverson, the port side cannons.
-They're fully charged.

04:24.555 --> 04:25.556
Shields down.

04:26.015 --> 04:26.849
Fire!

04:32.105 --> 04:34.274
We lost an energy inverter
on two cannons.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.233
Diverting power!

04:44.033 --> 04:45.910
Thanks for covering for us, Atlas.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.579
Coran, take us up
to covering fire position.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.707
Iverson, once those cannons
come back online,

04:50.790 --> 04:52.500
we'll need to give Voltron some support.

05:09.183 --> 05:12.270
- Guys, my bayard port just opened.
- Mine, too.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.515
Pidge, shield!

06:05.448 --> 06:06.491
Launch fighters!

06:12.997 --> 06:14.874
We're coming in.
Covering fire.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.328
Paladins, what happened?
Are you okay?

06:52.787 --> 06:55.414
Those blades, they sapped our energy.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.251
It felt like the Komar.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.352
Pilots, fall back.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.146
Those blasts can vaporize you.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.065
Keith's right.
You've successfully drawn its fire.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.775
Rendezvous with the Atlas ASAP.

07:22.859 --> 07:23.693
Roger that.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.238
The enemy has turned its attention
back to Voltron, sir.

07:27.321 --> 07:30.283
-Sam, how are those cannons?
-Coming back online now.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.367
Fire!

07:47.383 --> 07:48.217
Shields up!

07:54.724 --> 07:56.267
We've lost shields.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.165
It's destabilizing
the molecular reflection arrays!

08:19.248 --> 08:20.833
Pull out of range!

08:24.754 --> 08:27.423
The power this creature
is generating is unheard of.

08:27.882 --> 08:31.511
My surge indicators are spiking
every time it's about to fire.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.764
That sickle absorbed our quintessence.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.558
It's using our own energy
to power its attack.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.309
Like the Komar.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.479
Then we'll have to avoid direct contact.

08:41.938 --> 08:42.938
Everyone, up!

09:13.803 --> 09:17.056
Guys, we need to be careful.
There are innocent lives down there.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.475
Then let's take the fight
to the sky!

09:34.865 --> 09:37.660
- We can't get a clear shot!
- Rebooting shields!

09:37.910 --> 09:40.162
- Five minutes out!
- Rerouting power.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.128
Pidge, the cannon!

09:54.927 --> 09:57.138
The Atlas! No!

10:22.163 --> 10:23.205
What's our status?

10:23.289 --> 10:26.250
Stabilizing thrusters are gone.
I'm attempting to override.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.461
The cannons are offline again,
all of them.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.254
Initiating backup generators!

10:33.966 --> 10:34.842
No.

11:03.579 --> 11:06.415
Shiro, the shields are gone
and we don't have countermeasures!

11:06.582 --> 11:07.541
What do we do?

11:07.625 --> 11:10.711
- Cannons are still offline.
- It's charging up for another attack!

11:10.795 --> 11:11.754
What do we do, Shiro?

11:11.837 --> 11:14.090
Shields are offline.
Sir, what are your orders?

11:14.173 --> 11:15.633
It's got us in its sights.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.176
We have no countermeasures.

11:24.308 --> 11:27.478
I'm rerouting power,
but we're at least five minutes out!

11:28.270 --> 11:29.355
Bring us up.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.315
Set coordinates for upper atmosphere.

11:31.690 --> 11:32.775
But Voltron.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.361
Commander Holt,
I need all the power we've got.

11:35.444 --> 11:36.278
Copy that.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.474
Atlas crew, hold tight.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.658
Everyone, report in.

13:04.825 --> 13:08.120
I-I can barely move.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.374
Voltron's power levels
are depleted.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.836
I've never seen
anything this powerful before.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.505
Guys...

14:18.232 --> 14:20.776
Is that... the Atlas?

14:21.277 --> 14:22.903
Paladins, are you there?

14:22.987 --> 14:23.988
What's your status?

14:24.363 --> 14:25.197
We're here.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.867
-How did you...?
-I'm not exactly sure.

14:28.659 --> 14:29.910
But we've got you covered.

14:31.912 --> 14:35.165
-Hostile returning for another pass.
-Get me eyes on the target.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.816
We have to do something.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.110
It's gonna destroy the Atlas.

15:50.991 --> 15:51.867
That's it.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.204
It's the only place on that thing
that isn't armored.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.873
We have to strike there
right before it fires.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.084
That's a split-second window.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.418
How do we do that?

16:03.671 --> 16:04.713
My bayard.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.174
Team, we've got one chance.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.759
Give it everything you've got!

16:08.842 --> 16:09.677
Lance!

16:54.513 --> 16:55.389
Anyone?

16:56.765 --> 16:57.599
Hello?

17:03.981 --> 17:04.815
I'm here.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.651
I'm here, too.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.657
Blue Lion, checking in.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.244
Did we do it?
Did we beat that thing?

17:20.289 --> 17:21.373
I think so.

17:22.915 --> 17:25.044
Atlas, what's your status?

17:26.252 --> 17:28.338
Atlas, are you receiving me?

17:29.131 --> 17:30.758
They're offline.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.343
What is that?

17:34.428 --> 17:37.681
Surge indicators
coming from that thing.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.558
I thought it was down.

17:40.559 --> 17:41.518
It is.

17:42.936 --> 17:43.771
Oh, no.

17:44.813 --> 17:45.689
What?

17:45.856 --> 17:47.066
It's powering up.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.610
It must have some kind
of self-destruct mechanism.

17:49.693 --> 17:50.819
According to my readings,

17:50.903 --> 17:53.947
the blast radius alone
will envelope half of the Earth.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.366
Then we need to get it out of here.

18:11.215 --> 18:14.343
Come on! Come on!

18:31.652 --> 18:33.612
It's been an honor to fly with you all.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.533
Now, everyone,
give it everything you've got!

19:59.907 --> 20:02.784
Today is a solemn day.

20:05.120 --> 20:08.916
Today, we look back at the lives
that have been lost,

20:10.042 --> 20:14.838
and the sacrifices that have been made
here on Earth and across the universe.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.176
There isn't one of us here today

20:19.259 --> 20:22.888
who hasn't experienced the tragedy
of losing someone close.

20:24.389 --> 20:28.602
It truly feels like a light
has gone out in our lives

20:29.519 --> 20:31.563
and the sun itself couldn't reignite it.

20:33.440 --> 20:38.779
But that light, that fire,
has not gone out completely.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.907
It is fueled within each of us

20:42.157 --> 20:45.494
by the memories
and the love of those we've lost.

20:46.411 --> 20:49.623
And now we must move forward
in their names.

20:50.624 --> 20:54.461
And shine that light onto a new path
for future generations.

20:55.170 --> 20:59.299
Today is a solemn day,
but it is also a day of hope.

21:00.384 --> 21:04.930
Earth is now stronger than ever,
and it stands as a beacon of light

21:05.764 --> 21:08.809
to help guide those fighting
against tyranny and oppression.

21:09.726 --> 21:14.481
From here, we will spread peace,
and together we will hold strong...

21:15.774 --> 21:18.193
as the defenders of the universe.

22:25.927 --> 22:29.431
As you know, we've spent months
recovering the pieces of this creature,

22:30.515 --> 22:32.476
but we never found its power source...

22:33.310 --> 22:34.352
until now.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.659
