18:00.169 --> 18:02.340
-if you don't mind me asking?
-Oh, real estate,

18:02.373 --> 18:04.477
mostly, uh, down in Manhattan.

18:06.181 --> 18:08.185
I kept the family
up here, though.

18:08.218 --> 18:09.822
I never had any kind of problem.

18:09.855 --> 18:11.826
Figured we were far enough away
from the city

18:11.859 --> 18:14.464
to be free from all that.

18:14.498 --> 18:17.303
Yeah, well, you'd be surprised.

18:17.337 --> 18:19.709
Happens everywhere these days.

18:21.345 --> 18:24.819
The silencer--
that's weird, though.

18:24.852 --> 18:27.825
-That you don't usually see.
-Oh?

18:31.365 --> 18:33.369
But then again,
you had that guy last week

18:33.402 --> 18:36.576
-that held up a mini-mart
in Lyndon with an AK-47.
-AK-47.

18:36.609 --> 18:40.182
-Ah.
-So I shouldn't be surprised
by much of anything anymore.

18:41.418 --> 18:43.355
-Yeah.
-STEVENSON: We'll send the guys
through in the morning

18:43.389 --> 18:45.694
to do a more detailed sweep-up,
if that's all right.

18:45.727 --> 18:47.263
I'm sure you had
a very long night.

18:47.297 --> 18:49.167
You know, actually, uh...

18:49.200 --> 18:51.438
I have family in Milton.

18:51.471 --> 18:53.275
If I give you the key,

18:53.309 --> 18:55.379
would it be all right
if I stayed with them?

18:55.413 --> 18:57.250
STEVENSON:
We'll leave it under the mat.

18:57.283 --> 18:58.620
(chuckles)

19:01.291 --> 19:03.329
(line ringing)

19:07.905 --> 19:09.909
EMILY:
Hello?

19:09.942 --> 19:12.180
Hey, kid, it's me.

19:12.213 --> 19:14.685
Sorry to be calling you
at this hour.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.394
(sighs) Uh, they found me.

19:21.298 --> 19:23.168
What?

19:23.202 --> 19:25.172
-Yeah.
-Are you okay?

19:25.206 --> 19:27.945
Yeah, I'm fine.
The dogs are fine.

19:27.978 --> 19:31.251
But if they found me
at the house, I can't go back.

19:31.284 --> 19:33.623
Are you sure it was...

19:33.656 --> 19:36.929
-it was them?
-(sighs) Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

19:36.963 --> 19:39.735
Just because...
after all this time, you know,

19:39.769 --> 19:42.674
-it seems pretty unlikely.
-Emily. Emily, I'm sure.

19:42.708 --> 19:46.281
I've been feeling it
for a few weeks now.

19:46.314 --> 19:48.252
I thought maybe
it was my imagination.

19:48.285 --> 19:51.592
My head making up ghosts
to remind me I'm getting lazy.

19:51.626 --> 19:55.232
I still have things
to worry about, but...

19:55.266 --> 19:57.236
No, this is not a drill.

19:57.270 --> 19:59.709
This is happening.

19:59.742 --> 20:02.246
I got to go get ahead of it now.

20:02.280 --> 20:04.952
(exhales) Okay.

20:04.985 --> 20:07.290
What can I do?

20:07.323 --> 20:08.793
(sighs)

20:10.296 --> 20:12.233
I'm, uh...

20:12.266 --> 20:15.507
I'm thinking that, uh...

20:15.540 --> 20:18.445
we're gonna have to
stay off the phones.

20:18.479 --> 20:20.483
You know, I'm gonna
lay low for a bit,

20:20.517 --> 20:22.253
just to be on the safe side.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.361
Okay.

20:26.395 --> 20:28.933
-How long?
-I don't know.

20:28.967 --> 20:31.973
A week, maybe.

20:32.006 --> 20:34.310
Couple of weeks.

20:36.348 --> 20:39.320
(sighs) A month, maybe.

20:43.863 --> 20:45.600
(chuckles)
I'm sorry.

20:45.634 --> 20:47.971
No, don't say that.

20:48.005 --> 20:52.313
-You've... You have
nothing to apologize for.
-All right.

20:53.783 --> 20:56.288
I'll call you as soon as I can.

20:56.321 --> 20:58.927
Yeah. Right.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.831
Okay. I love you, Dad.

21:00.864 --> 21:03.770
I love you, too. Bye, kiddo.

21:05.473 --> 21:06.876
(hangs up)

21:08.345 --> 21:09.849
(dog whimpers)

21:09.882 --> 21:11.351
What?

21:13.055 --> 21:14.925
I didn't lie to her.

21:16.394 --> 21:18.332
There's no reason
to worry her right now

21:18.365 --> 21:19.935
about things we don't know.

21:28.887 --> 21:32.861
MAN:
Space is the breath of art.

21:36.669 --> 21:38.372
You know who said that?

21:39.708 --> 21:41.378
BOY:
No.

21:45.887 --> 21:48.693
Any idea what it means?

21:48.726 --> 21:51.364
No. Do you?

21:51.398 --> 21:52.968
(chuckles)

21:53.001 --> 21:56.876
Well, I... I think it means,
when you're building a house,

21:56.909 --> 22:00.449
you got to have
a place for everyone

22:00.482 --> 22:02.788
and everything important.

22:02.821 --> 22:07.831
But it's good to have
some space that's just...

22:07.865 --> 22:10.336
you know, space.

22:10.369 --> 22:13.442
Do you think this is too big?

22:14.410 --> 22:18.385
Oh, no. I love
what we're building here.

22:18.418 --> 22:20.356
And I love building it with you.

22:22.159 --> 22:24.832
I do think that
we're gonna be able to

22:24.865 --> 22:27.871
host a small army in here,
though,

22:27.905 --> 22:30.009
by the time we're done.

22:30.042 --> 22:32.714
It's just for our family.

22:32.748 --> 22:34.484
Yeah?

22:34.518 --> 22:38.860
A room for you and Grandma,

22:38.893 --> 22:42.868
a room for me,
and a room for Mom and Dad.

22:44.404 --> 22:45.941
For Mom and Dad?

22:47.443 --> 22:50.015
In case somebody figures out

22:50.049 --> 22:52.486
how to bring them back someday.

23:01.471 --> 23:03.475
(crying)

23:09.622 --> 23:12.426
-(knocking)
-WOMAN: Harold?

23:12.460 --> 23:13.963
Yeah?

23:17.771 --> 23:20.409
There's a...
there's a call for you.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.979
Oh.

23:25.520 --> 23:26.622
Hello?

23:26.656 --> 23:28.458
MAN:
Uh, Assistant Director Harper?

23:28.493 --> 23:30.462
-This is Harper.
-Please hold.

23:33.569 --> 23:35.507
Have you ever thought
it might help

23:35.540 --> 23:38.145
-if he saw you cry?
-(groans)

23:38.178 --> 23:41.919
Everyone cries around a kid
that's lost his parents.

23:41.953 --> 23:44.591
I think just for variety's sake,

23:44.625 --> 23:45.927
I'll be the one that doesn't.

23:47.998 --> 23:49.802
MAN:
The assistant director
is on the line.

23:49.835 --> 23:51.471
(line beeps)

23:51.505 --> 23:53.141
WATERS:
Sir, this is Raymond Waters.

23:53.175 --> 23:55.079
Bob Blasky over at DCS
put me on to you.

23:55.112 --> 23:56.448
I'm working a case
he thought you might

23:56.481 --> 23:58.018
be able to be helpful with.

23:58.051 --> 23:59.588
What kind of case?

23:59.622 --> 24:00.790
Now, I have been granted
SCI access

24:00.824 --> 24:02.494
for the sake of
this interaction,

24:02.527 --> 24:03.529
-just so you're aware.
-I understand.

24:03.563 --> 24:04.865
What kind of case?

24:04.898 --> 24:06.736
In July 1987,

24:06.769 --> 24:09.073
a man under you went MIA
near Torkham.

24:09.107 --> 24:12.079
-You know the man
I'm referring to?
-Yes.

24:12.113 --> 24:13.650
Well, my assignment
was to ascertain

24:13.683 --> 24:15.553
whether the subject
was still in the wild,

24:15.587 --> 24:17.557
and if so,
to locate and retrieve him.

24:17.591 --> 24:19.093
-Now, about two weeks ago...
-Retrieve?

24:19.127 --> 24:21.565
-Yes, sir. Now, two weeks ago...
-What for?

24:21.599 --> 24:23.569
-(sighs) Sorry. Excuse me?
-What for?

24:24.705 --> 24:28.145
(stammers)
That file has been resolved.

24:28.178 --> 24:30.049
It's been sealed
for three decades.

24:30.082 --> 24:32.486
Why is it coming up again now?

24:32.521 --> 24:34.591
Sir, that's outside the scope
of my responsibilities.

24:34.625 --> 24:36.061
I've got an operation
gone sideways here

24:36.094 --> 24:38.065
and time is of the essence.
May I continue?

24:39.735 --> 24:41.271
Yes.

24:41.304 --> 24:43.576
Now, an operator was sent
to engage the subject.

24:43.609 --> 24:47.617
That operator was dumped,
the subject is at large.

24:47.651 --> 24:48.886
We do have redundancies
in place but,

24:48.920 --> 24:50.590
given your history
with the subject,

24:50.623 --> 24:52.627
DCS felt your insight
might prove valuable.

24:55.099 --> 24:56.736
Sir, I'm instructed
to relay to you

24:56.769 --> 24:58.639
your help was personally
requested by the secretary...

24:58.673 --> 25:00.242
Yeah, I get it.
I'll be in the air in an hour,

25:00.275 --> 25:01.846
on my way to you.

25:03.081 --> 25:04.752
-Thank you, sir. I'll...
-(hangs up)

25:07.023 --> 25:09.561
Is everything all right?

25:11.832 --> 25:13.235
No.

25:16.609 --> 25:18.245
(music playing quietly
on jukebox

25:31.872 --> 25:33.543
WAITRESS:
Service animals only.

25:35.279 --> 25:37.249
Sorry?

25:37.283 --> 25:39.253
They're not allowed
to be in here.

25:39.287 --> 25:41.124
Only service animals.

25:43.763 --> 25:47.604
Heh. Wa-Warming my feet's
not a service?

25:51.779 --> 25:55.787
Coffee, black,
and some rye toast.

25:55.820 --> 25:57.624
White or wheat?

26:00.362 --> 26:02.968
Wheat, please.

26:07.176 --> 26:09.180
(traffic whooshing past)

26:10.817 --> 26:12.319
STUART (on phone):
Mr. Dixon, how are you?

26:12.353 --> 26:14.925
CHASE:
Oh, great, thanks, Stuart.

26:14.958 --> 26:16.962
Listen, there's something
I'd like you to do for me.

26:16.996 --> 26:19.300
Uh, I'm gonna be coming out
in a few days,

26:19.333 --> 26:20.369
and I was wondering

26:20.402 --> 26:22.808
if you can make sure
the house is ready.

26:22.841 --> 26:26.916
Um, new sheets, uh, groceries.

26:26.949 --> 26:29.320
No dairy, almond milk,
coffee, you know.

26:29.353 --> 26:31.057
There ought to be
a list there somewhere.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.930
Wonderful. And will Mrs. Dixon
be coming with you?

26:35.332 --> 26:36.769
No.

26:36.802 --> 26:38.873
No, no, she won't.

26:40.944 --> 26:43.916
Uh, email me
if you have any questions.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.987
Understood.

26:46.020 --> 26:47.991
Looking forward to finally
putting a face to the name.

26:48.024 --> 26:50.095
Uh, me, too.

26:50.129 --> 26:51.632
So long.

26:55.372 --> 26:57.944
(vehicle approaching)

26:57.978 --> 27:00.717
(muffled music playing)

27:02.286 --> 27:04.323
(music playing faintly)

27:06.161 --> 27:08.098
(sniffles)

27:15.245 --> 27:17.249
-Waitress come yet?
-Yes, I sent her away.

27:17.283 --> 27:19.688
There are too many options.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.659
Uh...

27:23.161 --> 27:25.834
Listen, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

27:25.867 --> 27:27.403
I'll never get used to this.

27:27.436 --> 27:29.173
You people and your menus.

27:29.207 --> 27:31.745
There are three pages
of just pancakes.

27:35.185 --> 27:36.722
What?

27:36.755 --> 27:38.291
What is it?

27:40.897 --> 27:42.667
Uh...

27:43.903 --> 27:45.840
Ordinarily,

27:45.874 --> 27:49.380
when I get the feeling
I've been having all day--

27:49.413 --> 27:51.251
like...

27:51.284 --> 27:54.056
trouble is starting
to get close--

27:54.090 --> 27:55.994
I'd tell you
it's time for us to move again.

27:56.027 --> 27:58.431
Get ahead of things
before things catch up to us.

28:00.168 --> 28:01.437
But, um...

28:03.475 --> 28:05.479
Um...

28:05.513 --> 28:08.285
(takes deep breath)

28:10.055 --> 28:12.126
What if we don't keep running?

28:14.096 --> 28:16.000
What if we find
a place to stand still

28:16.034 --> 28:18.171
and we build something there?

28:20.442 --> 28:23.849
-Build what kind of something?
-Uh...

28:25.052 --> 28:26.755
(chuckles)

28:26.789 --> 28:27.857
A home.

28:29.126 --> 28:32.433
Life. A reality.

28:32.466 --> 28:34.470
A place
where good things happen.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.474
Those things are for sale
in this country.

28:36.508 --> 28:37.777
They can be manufactured,
if you know

28:37.811 --> 28:38.679
how to work the machinery.

28:38.713 --> 28:41.451
-I can do that.
-We can't stop moving.

28:41.484 --> 28:43.321
We can't stop moving,
they will find us.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.894
If the people we were
stop moving, they'd be found.

28:45.927 --> 28:48.131
But the people
we're about to become...

28:49.801 --> 28:51.939
No one's looking
for those people

28:51.972 --> 28:54.778
because those people
haven't done anything wrong.

28:56.247 --> 28:58.451
They are honest Americans

28:58.485 --> 29:00.523
looking to work hard.

29:00.556 --> 29:02.861
Be happy.

29:02.894 --> 29:04.463
Be a...

29:07.002 --> 29:09.340
Be a family.

29:09.373 --> 29:11.444
♪ ♪

29:16.588 --> 29:18.759
It's a comforting story.

29:20.095 --> 29:22.099
This place is filled
with comforting stories.

29:22.132 --> 29:24.470
It makes it so hard
to see the truth.

29:26.575 --> 29:28.846
The moment we left
the mountains,

29:28.879 --> 29:30.248
I think we both knew

29:30.282 --> 29:32.787
there was only one way
this could all end.

29:34.423 --> 29:35.960
I do not like the idea that

29:35.994 --> 29:38.164
we're lying to ourselves
about it,

29:38.198 --> 29:40.369
or to each other.

29:40.402 --> 29:43.241
I have drawn some comfort
in knowing that

29:43.274 --> 29:44.511
at least, when the end comes...

29:45.947 --> 29:47.851
...we will know
we did the right thing.

29:47.884 --> 29:50.255
And we will be together,
and maybe that's okay,

29:50.288 --> 29:51.959
maybe that's enough.

30:07.156 --> 30:08.526
Fuck that.

30:10.897 --> 30:12.534
I did what I did.

30:12.567 --> 30:16.007
And I'd do it again,
because it led to us.

30:16.040 --> 30:19.948
I don't care what your name is,
or mine.

30:19.981 --> 30:22.554
All I care about
is growing old with you.

30:28.899 --> 30:31.337
Come be someone new with me,

30:31.371 --> 30:33.576
and...

30:33.609 --> 30:35.045
and I swear to God,
I will make sure

30:35.078 --> 30:38.184
that no one or nothing
will ever harm you

30:38.218 --> 30:40.022
as long as I live.

30:54.083 --> 30:56.955
♪ ♪

31:17.029 --> 31:18.298
Yes.

31:24.176 --> 31:26.380
(laughs)

31:26.414 --> 31:27.584
(chuckles)

31:31.692 --> 31:33.194
Hmm.

31:33.228 --> 31:34.965
Wh-What, uh,
what are we gonna call

31:34.998 --> 31:37.035
these new people
we're about to be?

31:41.010 --> 31:42.647
(vehicle arrives)

31:45.252 --> 31:47.322
(phone rings)

31:57.176 --> 31:59.981
HARPER:
Hello, this Harold Harper.

32:00.015 --> 32:00.983
Listen, there are
a couple of things

32:01.017 --> 32:02.654
that we need to get clear.

32:02.687 --> 32:05.392
First, I am not running this op.

32:05.425 --> 32:08.164
I was asked in
strictly to consult.

32:08.198 --> 32:11.237
No one here knows that
I'm speaking with you right now.

32:11.270 --> 32:13.108
There's a good chance
I am violating

32:13.141 --> 32:15.011
several laws by doing so,

32:15.045 --> 32:17.951
which should earn me
a little latitude. Does it?

32:20.021 --> 32:21.357
No.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.463
All right.

32:24.498 --> 32:26.267
The second thing, then,

32:26.300 --> 32:28.304
is that I need you
to go to your car.

32:28.338 --> 32:29.674
Right now.

32:29.708 --> 32:32.312
I need to explain to you
how I just called you

32:32.346 --> 32:36.053
on a phone that you believed
was clean and untraceable.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.426
-You haven't paid yet.
-When you get to the car,
take a look underneath.

32:39.460 --> 32:42.099
Passenger side,
rear wheel well.

32:46.708 --> 32:49.413
Apparently, we can match
the transponder's location

32:49.446 --> 32:52.085
to the location of
the phone moving with it,

32:52.119 --> 32:54.190
and then reverse engineer
the number.

32:55.458 --> 32:57.429
That one surprised me.

32:57.462 --> 32:59.534
I didn't know
that was a thing we could do.

33:03.809 --> 33:05.780
I tell you this
partly to remind you

33:05.813 --> 33:09.053
that you have no idea
how different the game is

33:09.086 --> 33:11.490
than the last time
you played it.

33:11.525 --> 33:13.328
And partly because
you've got about three minutes

33:13.361 --> 33:15.398
before they're on top of you.

33:16.735 --> 33:19.173
I'm not looking
at the transponder feed,

33:19.206 --> 33:21.177
so let me know
when you're driving.

33:21.210 --> 33:22.747
We can talk further.

33:28.659 --> 33:30.696
I'm moving.

33:31.732 --> 33:33.702
HARPER (on phone):
I understand you lost your wife.

33:34.771 --> 33:36.474
Yeah.

33:36.508 --> 33:38.712
Few years back.

33:38.746 --> 33:41.384
-Cancer?
-Huntington's Disease.

33:41.417 --> 33:45.125
Oh, that's...
that's awful. I'm sorry.

33:45.158 --> 33:47.196
I appreciate that.

33:48.632 --> 33:51.470
It's been a very long time
since I've heard your voice.

33:51.505 --> 33:53.241
-Ah.
-Strange experience.

33:53.274 --> 33:55.445
Frankly, I'd imagined
you were dead.

33:55.478 --> 33:57.617
(short chuckle) No.

33:57.650 --> 33:59.453
I just retired.

34:00.790 --> 34:02.760
I, uh... I read about

34:02.794 --> 34:05.666
your son and daughter-in-law
in the paper.

34:05.700 --> 34:07.069
-I thought about reaching out,
-Yeah.

34:07.102 --> 34:09.073
but, uh, you know...

34:09.106 --> 34:11.778
I assume that you can
see the tail by now, right?

34:12.814 --> 34:14.784
As far as I can tell,
these are specialists.

34:14.818 --> 34:16.087
They're supposed
to be very good,

34:16.120 --> 34:17.790
so I'd keep my distance.

34:19.159 --> 34:23.802
Now, let me tell you where I am.
I'm watching about

34:23.836 --> 34:26.541
a half a dozen
high-end contract operators

34:26.575 --> 34:29.681
fail at blending into
Caledonia County Airfield,

34:29.714 --> 34:32.553
loitering around
their chartered jet.

34:32.587 --> 34:36.093
Their op is not to kill you.

34:36.127 --> 34:37.530
It's to retrieve you

34:37.563 --> 34:40.368
and put you on that plane.

34:40.402 --> 34:43.274
No one will tell me
where's it's headed or why,

34:43.308 --> 34:48.117
but as I sit here
imagining nightmare scenarios,

34:48.151 --> 34:49.854
I'm aware that,
with a full tank of gas,

34:49.888 --> 34:52.660
that plane can be in Kabul
tomorrow afternoon

34:52.694 --> 34:55.566
without touching the ground.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.404
The nightmare scenario
is that Faraz Hamzad

34:58.438 --> 35:02.112
wants to see you again,
and he convinced

35:02.145 --> 35:05.085
someone in the U. S. government
to make that happen.

35:06.454 --> 35:09.794
Why are you telling me this?
Why are you warning me?

35:09.828 --> 35:12.533
Because the scenario
is a nightmare for you,

35:12.567 --> 35:14.571
but it's pretty shitty
for me, too.

35:14.604 --> 35:17.209
This story comes back to life,
and I'm gonna have to answer

35:17.242 --> 35:18.879
for some things
that were dead and buried

35:18.912 --> 35:20.850
in the ground yesterday.

35:20.883 --> 35:23.856
Right now, I'm willing
to aid and abet your escape

35:23.889 --> 35:25.760
to prevent that.

35:25.793 --> 35:27.429
Now, I know you
well enough to know

35:27.462 --> 35:30.135
you're building
a list of options.

35:30.168 --> 35:32.740
Pretty soon you're gonna
realize there are only two.

35:32.774 --> 35:34.811
Number one, you engage.

35:34.844 --> 35:37.684
Go to ground,
figure out how to fight back.

35:37.717 --> 35:39.721
You go through that door,
and I'm here to tell you

35:39.754 --> 35:41.324
it's gonna end badly,

35:41.357 --> 35:43.194
because the first thing
that's gonna happen is

35:43.227 --> 35:45.198
this will become my operation,

35:45.231 --> 35:47.369
and I'm gonna
have to put you down.

35:47.402 --> 35:49.373
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

35:49.406 --> 35:50.710
Don't.

35:50.743 --> 35:53.181
Just don't.

35:53.214 --> 35:56.220
The transponder under the car.

35:56.253 --> 35:58.224
You left a silencer on a guy

35:58.257 --> 36:00.328
you tried to pass off
as a burglar.

36:00.362 --> 36:03.368
You aren't the guy you remember.

36:03.401 --> 36:07.309
I doubt I'd even recognize you
if I saw you right now.

36:07.342 --> 36:09.748
Some days,
I don't recognize myself,

36:09.781 --> 36:13.254
but I've got 10,000 agents
and a ten billion-dollar budget

36:13.287 --> 36:14.758
to make up
for whatever I've lost.

36:14.791 --> 36:16.260
What have you got?

36:16.293 --> 36:19.266
Mm. Maybe I have
a story worth telling.

36:19.299 --> 36:21.370
Different time now
than it was then.

36:21.404 --> 36:23.207
Maybe now I'm not the one

36:23.241 --> 36:24.911
who comes off looking
like the bad guy,

36:24.944 --> 36:27.315
and your life gets complicated.

36:28.819 --> 36:30.388
You're not gonna do that.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.760
Oh, really? Why?

36:32.794 --> 36:35.800
Because she's in this now.

36:35.833 --> 36:38.639
Whatever name you gave her...

36:38.672 --> 36:42.212
wherever you put her because
you thought she'd be safe...

36:43.281 --> 36:46.220
Your daughter is about to be
a part of this.

36:48.291 --> 36:51.531
And I'm telling you, if you
go through door number one,

36:51.565 --> 36:53.669
I'm gonna use her to get to you.

36:58.311 --> 37:01.450
You're about to drive this
to a place you're not gonna like

37:01.484 --> 37:03.956
-when we get there.
-You think

37:03.989 --> 37:05.793
I like any of this?

37:05.826 --> 37:07.764
And I'm not driving it
from the beginning.

37:07.797 --> 37:10.870
It's been your choices
that have brought us here.

37:13.842 --> 37:15.780
That brings us
to door number two.

37:17.315 --> 37:19.286
Door number two is...

37:19.319 --> 37:21.290
you disappear.

37:21.323 --> 37:23.294
Mm.
Yeah, I did that last time.

37:23.327 --> 37:26.968
No.
Not like last time.

37:27.002 --> 37:28.605
This time,
you walk out that door

37:28.639 --> 37:31.343
the same way
you walked in the first one.

37:31.377 --> 37:32.547
Alone.

37:33.882 --> 37:36.020
What's gonna happen is

37:36.053 --> 37:38.424
I'm gonna find your daughter

37:38.458 --> 37:40.295
and I'm gonna tell my people,

37:40.328 --> 37:42.867
"This is the only thread
that connects him to the world,

37:42.900 --> 37:45.305
the only piece of him
that we have a hold on."

37:45.338 --> 37:49.413
"So let's just sit," I'll say,
"and watch her and wait,

37:49.446 --> 37:51.985
and eventually he'll call."

37:52.018 --> 37:53.922
And you never will.

37:55.358 --> 37:57.997
No. No, no.

37:58.030 --> 38:00.335
Harold...

38:00.368 --> 38:02.439
-If you do call,
-Harold.

38:02.472 --> 38:04.878
if you reach out to her
in any way,

38:04.911 --> 38:07.717
there will be agents
at her door in minutes.

38:07.750 --> 38:09.052
They'll question her.

38:09.086 --> 38:10.723
I-If she knows about
crimes you've committed,

38:10.756 --> 38:12.325
she's going to jail.

38:12.359 --> 38:14.263
It could get worse from there.

38:16.333 --> 38:18.371
You disappear.

38:18.404 --> 38:20.341
She lives her life.

38:20.375 --> 38:23.014
And this story goes back into
the ground where I left it.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.357
Fuck you.

38:30.563 --> 38:33.869
You got 30 good years with her.

38:33.902 --> 38:35.906
That's 30 more
than it could've been,

38:35.940 --> 38:38.645
and you get to say goodbye
to her.

38:38.679 --> 38:40.549
That's not something
that's guaranteed.

38:40.583 --> 38:41.885
Trust me.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.091
As long as you stay away,

38:45.124 --> 38:46.895
she'll never even know
I'm there.

38:46.928 --> 38:48.364
From where I sit,
that sounds like

38:48.397 --> 38:50.468
a pretty good outcome
for all of us.

38:51.938 --> 38:54.343
I gave you a head start.
Take it.

38:54.376 --> 38:56.948
Lose the tail.
Disappear.

38:56.982 --> 38:59.419
You and I both get to spend
whatever years we have left

38:59.453 --> 39:02.994
on this earth pretending
we never knew each other.

39:04.129 --> 39:06.400
And that none of this
ever happened.

39:06.433 --> 39:08.070
(hangs up)

39:16.588 --> 39:18.625
-(helicopter blades whirring)
-(indistinct radio chatter)

39:28.110 --> 39:29.647
He's on the move.

39:30.916 --> 39:33.087
Yeah, I can see that.

39:33.120 --> 39:36.093
Just minutes before
we arrived on target, too.

39:36.126 --> 39:38.765
That's unfortunate.

39:40.603 --> 39:43.441
You were just on the phone
out there, yeah?

39:43.474 --> 39:45.546
Yes, I was.

39:45.579 --> 39:48.084
May I ask who it was
you were talking to?

39:48.117 --> 39:49.687
No, you may not.

39:53.027 --> 39:56.400
Son, do you know what
my position is at the FBI?

39:57.536 --> 39:59.106
Yes, sir.

39:59.139 --> 40:00.776
Do you think I was appointed
to that position

40:00.809 --> 40:03.548
because I'm someone
it's safe to fuck with?

40:04.751 --> 40:07.455
-No, sir.
-Then quit staring at me,

40:07.489 --> 40:09.961
before I start getting the idea
I'm being fucked with.

40:11.564 --> 40:12.934
Deal?

40:16.508 --> 40:17.409
Yeah.

40:26.595 --> 40:27.997
(beep)

40:28.030 --> 40:30.101
(line ringing)

40:31.170 --> 40:32.707
EMILY:
Hello?

40:32.740 --> 40:35.879
-Hey, it's me.
-Hey. Are you okay?

40:35.913 --> 40:38.885
-I thought we were
offline for a while.
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

40:38.919 --> 40:41.223
Listen, uh...

40:41.256 --> 40:44.497
We never talked about this...

40:44.530 --> 40:46.467
before, this, uh,

40:46.501 --> 40:50.174
this eventuality,
because, well...

40:50.208 --> 40:54.182
I never honestly thought
we'd ever have to,

40:54.216 --> 40:56.855
but, uh...

40:58.692 --> 41:00.896
(sighs) Shit.

41:00.929 --> 41:03.602
Dad, wh...
wh-what are you talking about?

41:05.673 --> 41:08.812
I've got to go away, sweetheart.

41:09.947 --> 41:11.918
-Yeah. No.
-Well, y-you said that before.

41:11.951 --> 41:13.655
-Yeah.
-I don't understand.

41:13.689 --> 41:15.726
-Away. Away, away.
-What's changed?

41:15.759 --> 41:17.530
For good.

41:17.563 --> 41:20.502
You and I, we're not gonna
be able to talk again.

41:21.303 --> 41:22.807
Not for a long time.

41:22.840 --> 41:25.779
Well, maybe not at all.

41:28.685 --> 41:30.054
Why?

41:31.591 --> 41:33.895
Oh, I thought
I'd covered the tracks.

41:33.929 --> 41:36.066
You know, I thought
that you were insulated,

41:36.100 --> 41:37.670
no matter what happened to me.

41:37.703 --> 41:41.076
Even if I had to move again,
at least you'd be safe.

41:41.110 --> 41:43.915
But I don't think
I can be in your life,

41:43.949 --> 41:46.888
not even as a voice on a phone,
and keep you safe now.

41:48.825 --> 41:49.794
(sighs)

41:53.100 --> 41:55.539
But may... well, maybe this is

41:55.572 --> 41:57.075
where this was always headed,
you know?

41:57.108 --> 41:58.277
Maybe this was...

42:00.582 --> 42:03.722
...this was it. This...

42:03.755 --> 42:07.563
being able to say goodbye
on our own terms.

42:07.596 --> 42:10.268
Yeah, maybe that's
what this was always about.

42:12.272 --> 42:16.313
(sighs) I'm sorry.

42:16.346 --> 42:19.219
Remember that I love you.

42:20.889 --> 42:24.864
That I'll always love you,
but I think I got to go now.

42:24.897 --> 42:26.233
Em?

42:29.841 --> 42:30.976
Emily?

42:35.118 --> 42:37.790
It'd help if I could
hear you say goodbye.

42:39.694 --> 42:40.796
(exhales)

42:41.831 --> 42:43.200
Em?

42:47.142 --> 42:49.279
Fuck that.

42:49.312 --> 42:50.381
Excuse me?

42:51.985 --> 42:55.358
I believe that things
have taken a turn.

42:55.391 --> 42:58.030
I believe that the way forward
is more dangerous

42:58.063 --> 43:01.103
