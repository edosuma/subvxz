something for me.

08:24.077 --> 08:26.377

- Open your God damn checkbook.

08:26.379 --> 08:29.046
Robert, there's no cause
for you to talk

08:29.048 --> 08:30.715

- Well, if you want me

08:30.717 --> 08:32.683
to invite him
to afternoon tea, I will.

08:32.684 --> 08:34.986

away, this is how much

08:34.988 --> 08:37.154

that you not only schemed

murdered someone to cover it up.

26:23.089 --> 26:27.258
I want your body one last time

26:32.398 --> 26:35.032

<i>Do not interrupt me!</i>

suggesting is a good idea.

All right, you want the truth,

There was a guard, sent a letter

what was going on in there.

33:07.695 --> 33:08.994

33:10.831 --> 33:14.600

We were hard men in there.

33:25.779 --> 33:28.113
You can believe it or not,
it's the truth.

33:28.115 --> 33:30.115

33:38.859 --> 33:40.659

33:40.661 --> 33:42.861

34:09.989 --> 34:14.025

34:24.204 --> 34:26.772

- To quote you,

34:26.774 --> 34:29.041
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

34:29.043 --> 34:31.710
I certainly didn't go to
Robert's house this morning

34:31.712 --> 34:34.813
and tell him that I think that
you had Frank Gallo murdered

34:34.815 --> 34:36.181
So he wouldn't be able
to testify.

34:36.183 --> 34:38.016
And I certainly didn't say
if you had,

34:38.018 --> 34:40.819
you made a huge mistake
because now this tape

34:40.821 --> 34:42.020
is a death bed confession

34:42.022 --> 34:44.089
and by law is admissible.

34:44.091 --> 34:45.924
And all that bullshit
I came up with,

34:45.926 --> 34:48.293
about Robert being intimidated
by Frank Gallo,

34:48.295 --> 34:50.128
well, that doesn't apply anymore

34:50.130 --> 34:53.031
because Frank Gallo's dead.

34:53.033 --> 34:55.701
- So what do you want?
- What I want

34:55.703 --> 34:59.004
is for you to go away
for murder.

34:59.006 --> 35:01.073
But that's not gonna happen

35:01.075 --> 35:03.742
so I'll settle for the number
I wanted in the first place.

35:03.744 --> 35:06.211
But you're never gonna pull
this shit again on prisoners

35:06.213 --> 35:09.948

35:11.719 --> 35:15.053

to one of your own prisons,

35:15.055 --> 35:16.755
five seconds later.

35:25.833 --> 35:28.233

that I could work with.

I'd like you both to leave.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.906

35:34.908 --> 35:36.808

35:36.810 --> 35:38.110
you're gonna write up
something for me

35:38.112 --> 35:40.011
and you're not gonna like it.

35:40.013 --> 35:41.346
But if you wanna
stay out of prison,

35:41.348 --> 35:43.014
you're gonna make damn sure

36:01.135 --> 36:03.001
That's how I got in.

I don't give a shit

36:07.908 --> 36:09.341

affidavit back.

36:09.343 --> 36:11.376
Sure thing. You also want me
to sign over

36:13.547 --> 36:15.947
You can keep
your shitty house.

36:15.949 --> 36:17.249

He said he's here
for his affidavit

36:21.321 --> 36:24.156

you smug piece of shit.

We don't need to

We just need to show you this.

36:34.101 --> 36:36.468
- What's that?
- That's a signed confession

36:36.470 --> 36:39.204
from Robert Shapiro,
say he entered into a conspiracy

36:39.206 --> 36:41.339
with Masterson Construction
to defraud

36:41.341 --> 36:43.074
the United States government.

36:43.076 --> 36:46.511
And that that conspiracy
was arranged by you.

36:46.513 --> 36:49.447
No way.
Roger would never do that.

36:49.449 --> 36:51.550
Oh, he did it.
For the same reason

36:51.552 --> 36:53.552

what we want.

right now, Tommy.

and call him,

36:59.226 --> 37:02.093

and see I'm not lying.

37:02.095 --> 37:04.429

we're not leaving here
