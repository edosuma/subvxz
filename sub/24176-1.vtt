00:36.828 --> 00:38.444
<i>It's 7:30.</i>

01:07.317 --> 01:10.776
FEBRUARY 17th

01:18.579 --> 01:20.570
He's not in his office.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.114
<i>- Luca Pasture'?
- Yes.</i>

01:24.251 --> 01:27.289
This way. A pleasure, Rocco Venturi.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.420
- Police, right?
- Yes.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.710
Good, I was feeling in the minority.

01:31.842 --> 01:35.005
Everything's here at CID:
revenue officers, railroad police...

01:35.387 --> 01:37.003
- Do you smoke?
- No.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.215
You will.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.264
Scaglia, here's the new guy.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.986
Make yourself useful,
one copy of each, there.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.781
- Testing, testing. It works?
- Yes.

01:57.909 --> 02:00.446
Goes in your jacket pocket, Magni.

02:10.589 --> 02:13.206
- Who are we nabbing?
- Mario Chiesa, a socialist.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.254
President of the Pio Albergo
Trivulzio Retirement Home.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.878
A friend of Craxi's,
like Tognoli and Pillitteri.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.630
Counting on being Mayor.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.508
He asked Magni
for 10% on the cleaning contract.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.889
- And Magni reported him.
- Yeah.

02:26.021 --> 02:29.230
Just because he had
no kickback funds, depression's on!

02:30.984 --> 02:32.725
He's paying!

02:32.986 --> 02:36.229
<i>All I've got is seven million,
I'm in a bind right now.</i>

02:36.448 --> 02:38.439
<i>- And the other seven?
- Let's move 'm.</i>

02:38.659 --> 02:40.866
Bet he won't make Mayor anymore!

02:51.588 --> 02:53.920
That money is Mr. Chiesa's.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.962
You're wrong, it's ours, Counselor,

02:57.177 --> 03:00.465
check it, I signed every bill.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.343
Your client is under arrest
for extortion.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.647
Officer, we need invoices,
account logs, anything you find.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.974
Okay, we're examining it all.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.357
- Any doubts, Counselor?
- Can I use the bathroom at least?

03:17.572 --> 03:19.233
Make it fast.

03:33.255 --> 03:34.711
Chiesa!

03:42.305 --> 03:45.172
- How dare you?
- What did you flush away?

03:46.226 --> 03:49.764
- Who the fuck's there with Chiesa?
- Pastore, the new guy.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.056
- What's going on?
- He attacked me, I'll report him.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.726
He was flushing something.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.187
That's not true.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.656
More payola?

04:12.002 --> 04:13.913
Who's it from?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.383
Take it easy!

04:25.599 --> 04:27.806
- Di Pietro.
- Pleasure.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.635
Good, it's thanks to you, take it.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.681
I know what you're all thinking...

05:17.317 --> 05:19.354
the 1980s are over.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.277
Great times, anything was possible.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.231
Sky-high turnover, we had fun,

05:25.450 --> 05:27.066
we went to bed late.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.280
Today there's a depression

05:29.496 --> 05:32.454
and here at Publitalia
the advertising volume is sliding.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.791
But the 1980s are a state of mind,

05:35.919 --> 05:37.830
they can return and last forever,

05:37.963 --> 05:39.249
it's entirely up to you.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.294
The depression is an opportunity,

05:43.218 --> 05:46.427
no more eating out, no movies,
no beach weekends,

05:46.638 --> 05:48.254
people will stay home

05:48.473 --> 05:50.089
and watch TV.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.016
"Great is the confusion under the sky,"

05:53.144 --> 05:54.634
"the situation is excellent."

05:55.230 --> 05:57.392
Are you a Communist, Notte?

05:58.066 --> 05:59.727
You quote Mao Tse-tung!

06:01.403 --> 06:02.985
I like it, as a slogan.

06:03.697 --> 06:07.782
Slogans aside, Mr. Dell'Utri,
can we talk about real problems?

06:07.993 --> 06:12.078
Here's an example:
Carlo Berardi, hardware items.

06:12.956 --> 06:16.449
In a 5-year period, he invested two
billion liras in advertising with us.

06:17.085 --> 06:20.419
His contract runs out next month
and he doesn't want to renew.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.463
- What did you propose?
- Everything!

06:23.675 --> 06:26.463
The World Motorcycle Championships,
Wrestling, TV documentaries...

06:26.678 --> 06:30.091
Notte, could you give Corradi
a hand with Berardi?

06:31.016 --> 06:32.302
Certainly.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.972
I don't need to know
my client's profile,

06:36.146 --> 06:39.184
he's not buying because he's broke,
I know my job!

06:39.649 --> 06:41.265
Mr. Notte does too.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.403
His consultancies
have always paid off.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.530
Excuse me, I have to go.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.036
What's his problem?

06:58.168 --> 06:59.750
Scared you'll steal his job.

06:59.878 --> 07:00.868
Me?

07:01.004 --> 07:03.462
The CEO is looking
for a new assistant director,

07:03.590 --> 07:04.955
Corradi was favored,

07:05.091 --> 07:06.957
but now he wants an outsider.

07:08.094 --> 07:12.383
Can you see yourself managing
all the advertising for Fininvest?

07:14.809 --> 07:17.426
- Think about it.
- Goodbye.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.774
Let's check your bag.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.925
Pietro, what the fuck did you do?

07:50.136 --> 07:52.218
They made me empty my bag.

07:52.430 --> 07:55.092
- Take your hands off me!
- C'mon, out!

07:58.853 --> 08:00.935
Welcome back to Italy, fuck-all!

08:01.106 --> 08:04.269
If it disgusts you,
you didn't have to come back.

08:05.151 --> 08:08.439
You wish I'd stayed in Iraq
a little longer, right, Dad?

08:08.571 --> 08:11.984
- I'll be gone soon, don't worry.
- Iraq? No, Bangkok!

08:13.076 --> 08:16.694
- I took the long way.
- Yeah, war's been over for a year.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.325
Now what will you do?

08:19.541 --> 08:20.906
Go, Pietro!

09:03.668 --> 09:06.080
Veronica, death doesn't exist.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.630
People die only
when they're forgotten.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.670
Bring us that bottle of wine.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.891
Drink well when you feel bad.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.311
I know I'll be drinking it alone.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.356
- You have to go, don't you?
- I can toast with you.

09:29.277 --> 09:32.065
That friend of mine
confirmed the contract.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.276
What's the matter?

09:37.202 --> 09:40.536
Think it's fun answering the phone
on live TV?

09:43.083 --> 09:45.415
I don't want to be one of many,

09:45.627 --> 09:47.584
I want to be like Lorella Cuccarini.

09:48.171 --> 09:51.334
- "The most loved by ltalians“!
- What's funny?

09:52.342 --> 09:55.300
- Do you want "Buona Domenica"?
- What for?

09:56.179 --> 09:59.171
She's there, I want "Domenica ln".

10:00.809 --> 10:04.518
You always said
you'd do anything for me, so do it.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.855
Alright.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.120
So, that's why you're out here!

10:27.877 --> 10:29.413
What a shame!

10:29.963 --> 10:32.546
A hot babe like that,
with an old man.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.340
- Maybe he's her father.
- No way!

10:35.593 --> 10:38.176
That's Michele Mainaghi,
built half of Milan.

10:38.304 --> 10:42.093
He's into everything:
pharmaceuticals, insurance...

10:42.308 --> 10:45.016
One like that
won't even let you peek.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.978
He's leaving her all alone?

10:48.731 --> 10:50.062
Bye.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.282
Looking for company?

11:16.009 --> 11:18.341
Good for you, mission accomplished.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.845
Now go back to your pack,
wrong timing.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.551
Did he promise he'd leave his wife,
but hasn't?

11:26.978 --> 11:28.810
I saw you crying-

11:31.441 --> 11:34.729
My mother died,
that's why I was crying.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.111
- Is everything alright?
- Yes, go, go.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.368
- Yes, may I have my coat?
- Of course.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.580
I'd never leave you all alone.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.888
- Prorugby!
- Yeah, we play in League B.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.887
Right, I play in League A.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.853
Buio...

12:16.819 --> 12:18.685
Buio...

12:19.239 --> 12:21.230
C'mon, my love!

12:23.076 --> 12:24.658
C'mon!

12:25.620 --> 12:27.657
I have such need.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.321
Buio...

13:02.198 --> 13:04.189
I didn't ring for a call girl.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.989
Forget the old times,
I'm in mourning.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.697
Of course...

13:13.584 --> 13:15.120
Sorry.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.625
I'm not here for affection.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.665
I have to win a client over.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.916
What does an old
Lombardy industrialist want?

14:01.341 --> 14:02.502
Me.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.709
Don't you think?

14:07.305 --> 14:09.637
I saw you on TV the other day.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.841
In a while
you'll see me every Sunday.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.803
- On Rai Uno.
- You're serious?

14:18.524 --> 14:20.856
You know how "Domenica ln" started?

14:21.527 --> 14:23.689
Due to the gas crisis.

14:26.115 --> 14:29.449
Instead of driving to the beach,
people had to stay home.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.117
You're not human.

14:36.167 --> 14:40.377
Where do you come from? I think
you were unpackaged like this.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.217
<i>Arrested in Milan
Mario Chiesa, engineer,</i>

14:55.395 --> 14:57.932
<i>president of a city retirement home.</i>

14:58.106 --> 15:00.268
<i>He's accused of graft.</i>

15:00.441 --> 15:03.274
<i>The agency has
considerable financial assets.</i>

15:03.444 --> 15:05.560
<i>The Milan Socialist Party federation</i>

15:05.780 --> 15:09.318
<i>has reaffirmed
its total non-involvement</i>

15:09.575 --> 15:13.443
<i>with the charges against Chiesa.</i>

15:13.663 --> 15:16.246
<i>The president of
the Pio Albergo Trivulzio</i>

15:16.416 --> 15:19.078
<i>has been suspended from the party.</i>

15:23.923 --> 15:26.790
The Socialists have dumped him:

15:27.009 --> 15:29.171
"Chiesa's an idiot
because he got caught."

15:29.303 --> 15:32.261
Venturi, when's
the press review over?

15:33.224 --> 15:35.841
By the way, you still owe me money.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.057
The toilet needs paper.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.893
- Go, Fenati, go!
- How did the interrogation go?

15:43.109 --> 15:46.318
- I was about to ask that!
- Mr. Borrelli, hello.

15:47.864 --> 15:52.108
We're singing our hymn,
but "him" won't sing... for now!

15:52.577 --> 15:56.866
Being caught in the act,
he can't get out of a summary trial.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.789
- Not even the Lord himself!
- Back to work then.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.416
- Good day.
- Goodbye.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.670
So, he gets a summary trial.

16:14.307 --> 16:18.016
But he'll just go down
for a 7-million bribe

16:18.227 --> 16:21.060
and then return home,
not involving anyone.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.931
$0?

16:24.400 --> 16:28.860
He works with Milan's biggest
industrialists, he's taken billions.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.114
Find those billions.

16:41.459 --> 16:44.076
What was your viral load last time?

16:44.253 --> 16:47.871
- 45.
- Your ESR wasn't good either.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.586
I might send Mainaghi to prison.

16:54.180 --> 16:57.798
You said there was no way, no proof

16:58.184 --> 17:00.391
he was trafficking infected blood.

17:00.645 --> 17:03.103
He might be involved
in the investigation.

17:03.314 --> 17:06.271
Now I see why
you got yourself transferred there.

17:07.693 --> 17:12.904
What do infected blood transfusions
have to do with your investigation?

17:13.574 --> 17:14.859
Nothing.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.864
If I can't catch him for the blood,

17:18.079 --> 17:20.319
I will for the kickbacks.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.782
I don't care,
I want him to lose everything.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.834
Like I did.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.332
It's Mainaghi's fault I have HIV.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.587
Have you forgotten?

18:06.127 --> 18:09.586
Recently she was tired, pale...

18:12.758 --> 18:15.125
but she still flirted with the doctor

18:15.886 --> 18:17.877
and he too...

18:21.434 --> 18:25.223
That's how Mom was,
beautiful and fragile.

18:27.273 --> 18:31.062
She was a light
no one could keep from looking at.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.528
Maybe that's why there aren't
many of us here today,

18:35.740 --> 18:39.779
no one really wants to know
that light has gone out.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.072
Bye, Mom.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.283
Father Giorgio, I've finished.

18:46.167 --> 18:49.285
We beseech You, Lord, God Almighty,

18:50.630 --> 18:54.089
for the faithful soul
that has left this world...

19:01.265 --> 19:03.723
Sorry, I couldn't find a taxi.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.514
You were never there for her anyway.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.564
She's the one who didn't want me.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.813
Sure...

19:15.237 --> 19:17.148
Mom's fault!

19:34.382 --> 19:35.918
Corradi!

19:41.806 --> 19:44.298
Give me the papers on Berardi.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.930
- I already have.
- No, you gave me last year's.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.853
You have dark circles.
Went to bed late?

19:54.527 --> 19:57.565
Let's make an appointment with him,
or is it too much to ask?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.984
Done, ask my secretary.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.156
Sir, hello.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.566
Hello.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.406
- See you inside.
- Dickhead.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.203
Hello.

20:11.377 --> 20:14.335
I'm glad you're here.
How's it going with Berardi?

20:14.922 --> 20:16.708
I have some good ideas.

20:16.924 --> 20:21.543
Enrico Lodato, may I introduce
a marketing thoroughbred.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.887
Leonardo Notte. A pleasure.

20:25.099 --> 20:28.558
Have you sired foals?
That's what thoroughbreds should do.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.636
No, but I've applied myself a lot.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.771
Let's go in.

20:37.445 --> 20:40.403
The Italian political situation
is in a state of confusion.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.988
New forces like the Northern League

20:43.200 --> 20:46.409
have a growing consensus,
while the Christian Democrats...

20:46.620 --> 20:49.738
Why this little lesson
from a Christian Democrat?

20:49.957 --> 20:52.949
Dell'Utri doesn't want us to bullshit

20:53.169 --> 20:55.706
when clients talk politics to us.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.912
Why did he ask you to come?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.547
Dunno!

21:03.512 --> 21:07.096
...are like beached whales.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.057
Do we want to be beached whales?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.806
I'm speaking to the ladies,
of course.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.687
Do we want to stand still?

21:14.899 --> 21:16.810
We can't ignore the changing times!

21:25.451 --> 21:28.443
Smoking makes your teeth yellow.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.989
I smoke only when I'm bored.

21:33.083 --> 21:37.668
Always clean the seat, or the next
guy will say you're a pig.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.084
You're right, cavaliere.

21:41.509 --> 21:45.127
Let's go back and be subjected
to this pain in the ass.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.129
- Hi.
- Who's she?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.015
Don't you recognize me, Leo?

22:40.901 --> 22:42.312
I'm his daughter.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.645
I see, wrong evening.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.362
I'll call you.

22:50.786 --> 22:54.199
- Viola, what are you doing here?
- ls she your girlfriend?

22:58.168 --> 23:01.377
Mom had to go to Bologna,
uncle's sick.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.330
She said to stay here a while.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.674
Don't you listen to your messages?

23:07.428 --> 23:10.170
Your zipper's down.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.889
How long is "a while"?

23:14.226 --> 23:16.058
Where do I sleep?

23:17.605 --> 23:20.347
<i>We're in difficulty,
like families are</i>

23:20.524 --> 23:22.891
<i>when they discover
their son's a crook.</i>

23:23.027 --> 23:25.894
<i>That's Craxi's comment
regarding Mario Chiesa,</i>

23:26.113 --> 23:28.650
<i>ousted from the Party
after his arrest for graft...</i>

23:35.080 --> 23:38.618
Leave him! Leave him alone!

23:46.091 --> 23:47.877
Don't hurt me!

24:24.838 --> 24:27.956
What the fuck are you looking at?
Call the cops!

24:35.307 --> 24:36.797
An ambulance is coming.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.350
- Wait...
- The fuck I will!

24:39.603 --> 24:41.344
Pieces of shit!

24:42.064 --> 24:45.147
<i>I was lucky that guy came along,</i>

24:45.442 --> 24:48.651
<i>and I ask him to come fon/vard,</i>

24:49.655 --> 24:51.737
<i>he acted like a hero.</i>

24:51.949 --> 24:55.658
<i>And we like that kind of man
here at the League.</i>

24:56.078 --> 24:59.446
Listen, he might be a farmer,

24:59.665 --> 25:01.906
but he wears the robe,

25:02.126 --> 25:05.915
and when he starts
going through Mario's things...

25:07.297 --> 25:10.164
I lost a twelve-billion lira
contract.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.257
Twelve!

25:13.595 --> 25:15.586
Alright, bye.

25:16.974 --> 25:19.090
Did you make that phone call?

25:19.309 --> 25:21.391
Say hello to Anna, bye.

25:23.939 --> 25:26.101
Did you call your friend at the Rai?

25:26.316 --> 25:28.102
I haven't heard from anyone.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.184
Give him time.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.311
I knew it!

25:32.740 --> 25:34.697
You fucked me around.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.581
FEBRUARY 29th

25:44.918 --> 25:48.081
Why did you summon Chiesa's ex-wife?

25:48.338 --> 25:50.545
SOCIALISTS DISSOCIATE
FROM CHIESA

25:52.301 --> 25:55.293
Hi, I'm Giuliani Castello
from Corriere della Sera.

25:56.263 --> 25:59.801
It's a shit time, I'm new,
no one's helping me out.

26:00.017 --> 26:03.305
I'm new too
and it's a shit time for me too.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.846
Luca Pastore.

26:07.524 --> 26:10.312
Is it true Laura Sala
is your last hope?

26:10.527 --> 26:13.440
Chiesa won't talk,
he's holding out in jail...

26:13.781 --> 26:16.193
What do you want from his wife?

26:17.076 --> 26:20.068
He got another woman pregnant,
she'll want revenge, right?

26:20.287 --> 26:23.200
See what I do?
You know more than me.

26:23.373 --> 26:26.491
If you were in there with Di Pietro,
what would you ask?

26:26.627 --> 26:29.244
I've never been inside that office.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.370
Mrs. Sala, please come in.

26:32.299 --> 26:36.008
Pastore, bring the computer,
we need to get this report.

26:39.223 --> 26:42.682
If you help us get the money,
your name will never leave this room,

26:42.893 --> 26:45.009
I guarantee.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.308
- I should inform on my husband?
- Ex-husband.

26:48.524 --> 26:51.141
If I'm not wrong,
you're in court over alimony.

26:51.318 --> 26:55.687
I live in Milan! Think I want
the Socialists against me?

27:05.332 --> 27:07.289
Let's take a break.

27:08.669 --> 27:10.910
- May I have a word?
- Of course, Counselor.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.666
CHIESA - 'ILLEGAL FUNDS'

27:33.652 --> 27:35.359
AC MILAN ON THE DOWN-SLIDE

27:44.163 --> 27:47.622
- When did you stop wearing the ring?
- What?

27:49.084 --> 27:52.293
It took me a while
after my wife left me.

27:53.172 --> 27:56.005
I couldn't give her
what she wanted anymore.

28:00.304 --> 28:03.296
I took it off when I realized
there was another woman.

28:08.270 --> 28:11.262
I imagine it's hard
to get the right alimony

28:11.481 --> 28:13.267
from a guy who earns...

28:14.443 --> 28:17.936
two million liras a month...
officially!

28:18.155 --> 28:21.443
I'd never see the unofficial amount,
even if you find it.

28:21.783 --> 28:26.152
But he'd spend it with
his new family, if we don't find it.

28:26.914 --> 28:28.871
And it's a lot.

28:29.082 --> 28:32.871
Why do you need me?
You already have so much proof!

28:36.423 --> 28:38.630
We know how much it is...

28:39.801 --> 28:41.963
but not where it is.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.308
A little water?

28:57.736 --> 29:00.899
My husband prefers other labels.

29:07.996 --> 29:12.160
<i>Boar sightings continue in Milan,</i>

29:12.417 --> 29:14.704
<i>latest was last night at 11...</i>

29:14.920 --> 29:18.003
What the fuck's this?
I won't be in shit because of you!

29:18.507 --> 29:20.669
Give it here, you might get hurt.

29:21.093 --> 29:25.212
Batman, when will you
get a job and fuck off?

29:26.139 --> 29:28.801
I'm goin' all-out, there's no work.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.972
Why not hire me
at the construction site?

29:33.146 --> 29:36.229
We're already in shit,
you're all we need!

29:41.363 --> 29:44.901
Bosco, finally! A pleasure,
Gianni Bortolotti, Northern League.

29:45.117 --> 29:48.326
- Why are you here?
- I've come to thank you!

29:49.079 --> 29:50.535
Thank me?

29:50.706 --> 29:53.824
I spent all day with the cops,
thanks to your identikit.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.997
The two Albanians
pressed charges for injuries.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.670
It's absurd,
a guy saves people, then...

30:00.132 --> 30:01.793
Can we go inside?

30:01.925 --> 30:04.587
If I'd known you were a politician,
I'd have kept walking.

30:04.720 --> 30:08.429
- I have great news for you.
- Keep your voice down.

30:08.640 --> 30:13.476
This story of an avenger kicking
the shit out of Albanian thieves

30:13.687 --> 30:15.473
made Bossi lose his mind.

30:15.689 --> 30:17.680
Bossi? The Northern League?

30:17.899 --> 30:21.312
Yes, he wants you as a candidate!

30:22.070 --> 30:25.734
- He wants to run you for office!
- What's this, Candid Camera?

30:25.907 --> 30:29.070
No, it's true,
you'll never worry again.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.402
We'll take care of you now.

30:32.414 --> 30:34.325
You'll take care of me.

30:36.585 --> 30:39.998
Are you an idiot? The League
will carry you to Parliament!

30:41.256 --> 30:42.872
Go shit!

30:43.091 --> 30:45.708
Good! You can tell
your grandchildren

30:45.927 --> 30:49.420
about the screw-up you made today!
You idiot!

30:49.931 --> 30:52.218
<i>It's your turn now, deal with it.</i>

30:52.434 --> 30:54.766
Marina, I've only
ever seen her 3 times.

30:54.895 --> 30:58.513
<i>Ana' in those 3 times you made
her think you're wonderful.</i>

30:58.732 --> 31:02.191
<i>Don't you see?
She wanted to come to you.</i>

31:02.486 --> 31:04.068
Okay.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.612
Aren't you at work?

31:08.116 --> 31:09.652
I'm working at home today.

31:14.247 --> 31:15.829
Did you eat?

31:17.376 --> 31:19.333
How did it go at the Steiner School?

31:19.503 --> 31:21.790
It's an odd school.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.879
It's one of the most expensive
in Milan,

31:25.300 --> 31:27.337
Berlusconi's daughters go there.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.793
I saw them today.

31:30.013 --> 31:33.096
We wove baskets together.

31:35.185 --> 31:37.347
And I got questioned in History.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.350
Here I'd get "unprepared",
but grades don't exist there!

31:40.565 --> 31:42.272
It's me who's "unprepared" here.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.352
So, study.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.529
It's for stress.

32:37.164 --> 32:39.701
- You watch "Non è la Rai"?
- Yes...

32:40.125 --> 32:42.082
But with a critical eye.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.786
Have you seen "The Addams Family"?
It's showing downstairs.

32:46.006 --> 32:49.169
- No, you'll take me?
- I can't, I have to work, you go.

32:49.759 --> 32:52.592
- It's too much...
- Go shopping.

32:53.263 --> 32:55.345
It's nice staying here, you know?

32:56.725 --> 32:58.261
Don't get used to it.

33:11.615 --> 33:13.856
We found Fiuggi and Levissima!

33:14.659 --> 33:16.650
Pastore, where are you?

33:16.953 --> 33:18.535
Here.

33:21.416 --> 33:25.410
Chiesa named his Swiss bank accounts
after mineral waters!

33:27.172 --> 33:29.914
- How much was there?
- More than 10 billion.

33:30.759 --> 33:33.592
Ex-wives know how to hurt.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.213
Why do you have Mainaghi's file?

33:37.724 --> 33:39.556
Okay, your business.

33:40.977 --> 33:44.595
Do you have 200,000?
It's really urgent.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.063
- Here's 50,000 liras.
- Perfect.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.815
To repay Scaglia,
or he'll be on my back!

33:54.366 --> 33:56.073
Di Pietro, in here.

33:59.079 --> 34:01.366
Do you know today's date?

34:03.291 --> 34:06.534
The terms for the summary trial
have expired.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.370
Sir, I've decided not to do it.

34:10.297 --> 34:12.255
Why didn't you tell me?

34:12.425 --> 34:15.634
If you aim high,
your back has to be covered.

34:18.639 --> 34:22.599
Do me a favor,
stop mistrusting everyone.

34:36.866 --> 34:39.654
ANOTHER WILD BOAR SIGHTING

34:44.416 --> 34:46.873
What the fuck
are you doing back there?

34:52.507 --> 34:53.838
Sir...

34:54.759 --> 34:56.841
Get out, it's the wrong day.

35:05.145 --> 35:07.056
There'll be no summary trial.

35:08.982 --> 35:10.723
Close the door.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.776
I'd been on Chiesa for months.

35:21.703 --> 35:24.445
Think you can tell me how far to go?

35:24.623 --> 35:26.990
Why, how far do you want to go?

35:32.088 --> 35:33.453
To Craxi?

35:34.341 --> 35:38.209
Never say that name in here again
or you're out the window.

35:40.388 --> 35:43.676
Let's say we're going hunting
for a great big boar.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.391
Want to bet I get him?

35:51.399 --> 35:53.310
A thousand Iiras.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.568
A thousand Iiras.

36:00.450 --> 36:02.066
Back to work.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.627
Poor animal!

37:22.449 --> 37:24.281
Are you okay to drive?

37:26.244 --> 37:28.781
What are you, a cop?

37:31.124 --> 37:32.364
That depends.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.414
Are you dangerous?

37:39.382 --> 37:40.998
I'll drive you home.

37:42.427 --> 37:45.135
Who are you?
I've never seen you around.

37:50.143 --> 37:52.180
- I'm here for you.
- Oh, sure!

37:52.645 --> 37:55.888
This approach never works, right?

38:05.158 --> 38:07.650
Giving up so fast?

38:29.516 --> 38:31.382
Don't you have any secrets?

38:43.112 --> 38:45.649
I don't even know our name.
<i>Y</i>

38:48.451 --> 38:49.907
Luca.

38:53.540 --> 38:54.826
And then?

38:56.876 --> 38:58.617
Pastore (Shepherd).

39:00.004 --> 39:01.836
Perfect.

39:02.131 --> 39:03.917
I'm the black sheep.

39:25.405 --> 39:27.191
Wait a minute.

39:44.465 --> 39:45.955
Come here.

39:56.811 --> 39:59.052
Is it okay if we don't do anything?

40:01.149 --> 40:03.060
We can stay like this.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.179
Beatrice?

42:07.442 --> 42:10.059
- Bibi!
- I'm here, don't yell!

42:10.278 --> 42:12.770
A little more... on the other side.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.783
You could have taken a shower,
just look at you.

42:21.998 --> 42:25.411
Beatrice, move next to your Dad.

42:27.837 --> 42:31.546
Mr. Mainaghi, please,
one step forward.

42:32.425 --> 42:34.587
Beatrice more to the right.

42:34.802 --> 42:36.964
Is this for the family tomb?

42:37.180 --> 42:39.296
Capital's doing a photo shoot on Dad.

42:39.432 --> 42:41.639
Zeno, closer to your mother.

42:43.394 --> 42:45.510
Family portrait with gutter punk.

42:50.234 --> 42:54.228
MARCH 12th

42:56.115 --> 42:59.324
- Are you ready?
- I have the right bait this time.

43:32.193 --> 43:36.232
SALVO LIMA ASSASSINATED

43:48.167 --> 43:50.659
"Casa Vianello" is an Italian home.

43:50.878 --> 43:52.994
Warm, welcoming, good-feeling.

43:53.506 --> 43:58.251
It's where everyone would like
to return after a long day.

43:58.594 --> 44:00.551
Berardi, I made a mistake with you,

44:00.680 --> 44:02.967
I proposed programs
which were too masculine,

44:03.099 --> 44:05.887
but your customers love
home improvement

44:06.018 --> 44:08.009
and would like a home just like that.

44:08.146 --> 44:11.184
Buying your products,
they can aspire to a home just like

44:11.399 --> 44:13.481
Sandra and Raimondo's!

44:14.443 --> 44:17.981
- Isn't that stuff old?
- Absolutely not!

44:18.197 --> 44:20.985
It's in its fourth season
with ratings on the rise!

44:21.868 --> 44:23.450
I don't know...

44:23.619 --> 44:25.735
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

44:25.872 --> 44:28.079
It's not a waste of time, if maybe...

44:28.207 --> 44:31.950
Let's do this:
we take a six-month break.

44:32.879 --> 44:36.372
It's not a divorce,
just a pause to reflect.

44:36.757 --> 44:38.714
- A pause to reflect is good, but...
- Corradi!

44:38.926 --> 44:42.965
Didn't you hear him? Don't push.

44:43.931 --> 44:47.014
Thank you, goodbye,
my regards to your wife.

44:51.272 --> 44:52.683
Wait!

44:53.441 --> 44:54.897
Wait!

44:55.902 --> 44:58.894
I'd like to show you something,
wait just a moment.

45:19.884 --> 45:22.091
No, that's not right.

45:22.595 --> 45:24.427
I don't like it at all.

45:25.097 --> 45:26.883
It's like looking at an aquarium.

45:28.017 --> 45:31.135
My daughter might like it,
but my customers,

45:31.354 --> 45:33.345
they don't give a shit!

45:38.819 --> 45:40.901
Want to know a secret?

45:42.865 --> 45:45.277
People out there are horrible.

45:47.662 --> 45:49.573
Not me, not you.

45:50.164 --> 45:51.746
The others.

45:52.208 --> 45:55.872
They dream unspeakable things.
Look at them!

45:56.587 --> 45:59.875
They're all slim, size extra-small,
not much bosom.

46:00.091 --> 46:03.834
Little girls... Isn't that
what all little girls do?

46:03.970 --> 46:06.462
In their mother's clothes,
they play at being grown-up.

46:06.597 --> 46:08.679
When Dad comes home

46:08.891 --> 46:12.009
he finds his young daughter's
friends dancing, laughing...

46:12.895 --> 46:16.809
wanting him to spank them,
because they've been very bad.

46:16.983 --> 46:19.315
It's what they want, understand?

46:19.777 --> 46:23.395
No, I don't like what you say.

46:24.282 --> 46:26.239
We're talking about your customers,

46:26.450 --> 46:28.316
not about you or me.

46:28.536 --> 46:30.618
But all those hex-key buyers,

46:30.830 --> 46:33.288
as their daughters' friends sing,

46:33.499 --> 46:36.662
dance and dream of being famous,

46:37.837 --> 46:40.670
are observing
those young bodies moving,

46:41.007 --> 46:42.748
those naked legs,

46:42.967 --> 46:46.210
showing a bit of panties
in a pirouette.

46:47.263 --> 46:50.927
They hear an alluring,
subliminal voice...

46:52.101 --> 46:53.842
"Hey, you!

46:54.061 --> 46:55.643
You're a man,

46:55.855 --> 46:58.096
teach me how it's done."

47:11.412 --> 47:13.995
Corradi, could you pause it, please?

47:14.749 --> 47:16.990
Shall we have lunch, gentlemen?

47:27.094 --> 47:29.927
<i>I'm not at home, leave a message.</i>

47:30.931 --> 47:33.639
<i>Luca, I finally found you.</i>

47:34.602 --> 47:37.560
<i>I called all
the Luca Pastores in Milan.</i>

47:40.441 --> 47:42.352
Answer!

47:45.654 --> 47:49.318
<i>It's usually me
who disappears the morning after.</i>

47:53.829 --> 47:57.197
<i>But AIDS is transmitted
also via sex acts</i>

47:57.416 --> 47:58.872
<i>with infected persons.</i>

48:06.801 --> 48:09.293
<i>Phone lines are open!</i>

48:10.846 --> 48:14.339
<i>Who's on the line
with our lovely Veronica?</i>

48:14.558 --> 48:17.141
<i>We have Stefania from Pontedera.</i>

48:17.812 --> 48:20.053
<i>Let's hear what she has to say.</i>

48:20.481 --> 48:21.892
Bitch.

48:35.079 --> 48:37.070
Welcome among us, Batman!

48:39.542 --> 48:43.786
<i>- You're sure'?
- Yes, you start in two weeks.</i>

48:44.713 --> 48:46.329
I'll be on "Domenica ln"?

48:46.632 --> 48:48.623
I'm glad to hear you're so pleased.

48:48.843 --> 48:50.004
Michele, they're waiting!

48:51.011 --> 48:52.627
I have to leave you now.

48:52.930 --> 48:56.139
When I see you, you'll get
the best blow job of your life.

48:57.184 --> 48:58.891
I'm sure.

48:59.270 --> 49:00.886
See you soon.

49:05.568 --> 49:08.276
MARCH 22nd

49:17.580 --> 49:19.287
What are we doing here?

49:19.582 --> 49:23.667
You may know I need someone
for the assistant directorship.

49:25.421 --> 49:26.752
Really?

49:27.506 --> 49:29.668
I thought I'd give it to you.

49:32.094 --> 49:34.051
But then I changed my mind.

49:34.180 --> 49:37.764
This evening I'll nominate Corradi
for General Assistant Director.

49:39.435 --> 49:44.180
Don't let it upset you, the company
is full of assistant directors.

49:45.191 --> 49:47.899
I have something else
in mind for you.

49:48.402 --> 49:50.063
Are you aware of Chiquita?

49:52.072 --> 49:54.609
The jingle, “I'm Chiquita banana...",
you know?

49:55.367 --> 49:58.530
It used to be called
the United Fruit Company.

49:59.413 --> 50:02.280
They had enormous plantations
in Guatemala

50:03.167 --> 50:07.001
and controlled the government
through crooked dictators,

50:07.880 --> 50:10.622
that's why it was called
the Banana Republic.

50:11.592 --> 50:14.084
Then, in 1951,
free elections were held

50:14.220 --> 50:16.552
and Colonel Arbenz became president.

50:17.848 --> 50:23.184
His first act was to seize the United
plantations, and nationalize them.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.311
A disaster for the company!

50:26.524 --> 50:28.310
Know what they did?

50:29.109 --> 50:31.066
They hired an advertising agent.

50:32.404 --> 50:35.066
He put the problem
in a different light:

50:35.241 --> 50:38.529
the profit of a multinational
wasn't in the balance,

50:38.702 --> 50:41.660
in balance was American freedom.

50:41.872 --> 50:45.240
He organized fake Anti-American
demonstrations in Guatemala City,

50:46.085 --> 50:50.374
he opened a press office and
bombarded newspapers with the news

50:50.548 --> 50:52.664
that Arbenz was on Moscow's payroll

50:53.717 --> 50:57.176
and that an invasion of the U.S.
would start from Guatemala.

50:57.346 --> 51:00.555
A few months later,
the U.S. bombed Guatemala City

51:00.766 --> 51:03.599
calling it a war of liberation

51:04.103 --> 51:07.721
and the plantations
were returned to the United Fruit.

51:11.151 --> 51:12.641
Yes...

51:13.821 --> 51:15.653
it's a nice story,

51:17.116 --> 51:18.777
but what's it got to do with me?

51:22.079 --> 51:25.697
We have to save the Banana Republic.

51:44.518 --> 51:45.599
NEXT TIME

51:45.728 --> 51:47.014
- Zardo.
- Cremoni.

51:47.104 --> 51:48.970
- Cremoni.
- Rossi.

51:53.319 --> 51:54.809
People, please...

52:00.909 --> 52:04.072
Bribery and corruption?
That's all bullshit!

52:14.715 --> 52:17.377
No more letting them
push us around, fuck 'em!

52:17.551 --> 52:18.837
Now it's our turn!

52:25.809 --> 52:26.924
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
