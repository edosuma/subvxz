00:06.633 --> 00:08.885
Ha ha! Success! I rule.

00:08.885 --> 00:10.387
Aah! Street goblin!

00:10.387 --> 00:12.389
Oh, wait,

Where'd you
come from, buddy?

[whimpers]

00:15.934 --> 00:17.185
Aw, you must be lost.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.895
You don't live
too far from here.

00:18.895 --> 00:20.939
Better get ya home
before Tilly tries to keep ya.

00:20.939 --> 00:23.608
[Tilly] Oh, I sense
an unfamiliar canine energy!

00:23.608 --> 00:24.734
Come on, hurry! Let's go!

Hello? Oh, my gosh!

You found my dog!

00:31.116 --> 00:32.826
Sorry his face is all messed up,

00:32.826 --> 00:33.785
but he was already like that
when I got him,

00:33.785 --> 00:35.370
I swear.

00:35.370 --> 00:36.913
Oh, he's supposed to be
like this.

00:36.913 --> 00:38.456
[coughs]

00:38.456 --> 00:41.501
Since my lost dog posters
promised a reward...

00:41.501 --> 00:43.211
‐A reward?
‐Here ya go.

00:43.211 --> 00:45.505
One hundred dollars,
as promised.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.926
‐Thanks! Bye!

‐Huh?

01:13.450 --> 01:15.660
Be careful waving
your money around like that.

01:15.660 --> 01:18.830
You might attract
some shady characters.

01:18.830 --> 01:21.875
Hey, thanks, mister!
Name's Cricket Green,
what's yours?

01:21.875 --> 01:24.669

It's, uh...
I'm John.

‐Yeah, yeah, that's a name.
‐Yes, it is!

01:27.464 --> 01:29.424
You know what's better
than a hundred dollars?

01:29.424 --> 01:30.717
Two hundred dollars.

01:30.717 --> 01:32.052
Wow, that is better!

01:32.052 --> 01:33.511
Gosh, now this
one hundred dollar bill

01:33.511 --> 01:34.971
just looks like junk.

01:34.971 --> 01:37.807
Listen, you give me
your hundred dollars,

01:37.807 --> 01:40.101
I give you
a product to sell.

01:40.101 --> 01:43.480
‐Product to sell?
‐Sell some product,
double your money.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.523
Hmm... "Skull Slimmers."

01:45.523 --> 01:46.858
All right, let's see here...

01:46.858 --> 01:48.651
[grunts] OK...

01:48.651 --> 01:49.652
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

01:49.652 --> 01:51.279
Oh, it hurts!

01:51.279 --> 01:52.530
That's how you know
it's workin'!

01:52.530 --> 01:53.948
OK. [grunts]

01:53.948 --> 01:55.784
Do you really think
I can sell these?

01:55.784 --> 01:57.952
Listen, most people
aren't as, uh, ya know,

01:57.952 --> 01:59.579
street smart
as you and me.

01:59.579 --> 02:00.830
They're easy marks.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.457
Just tell 'em
whatever they wanna hear

02:02.457 --> 02:05.543
and these will
practically sell themselves.

02:05.543 --> 02:07.962
I don't know...
Isn't that kinda like lying?

02:07.962 --> 02:09.839
Nah, that's just
how business works.

02:09.839 --> 02:11.382
So, what do ya say?

02:11.382 --> 02:13.927
Double my money, huh?

02:13.927 --> 02:17.180
‐This picture's broken!
‐It's a puzzle, Gramma.

02:17.180 --> 02:20.558
So now I'm supposed to do
the picture‐maker's job
for him?

02:20.558 --> 02:22.268
[Cricket]
Attention, family!

02:22.268 --> 02:25.939
Get on my good side now,

02:25.939 --> 02:28.733
I present to you...
Skull Slimmers!

02:28.733 --> 02:31.361
These babies are gonna
revolutionize heads!

02:31.361 --> 02:32.862
Just, uh,
put it on your head

02:32.862 --> 02:34.823
and, uh,
twist the spinny thingy.

02:34.823 --> 02:36.616
Like this?

02:36.616 --> 02:37.992
This product is subpar.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.828
Subpar or not,

02:39.828 --> 02:42.163
I'm gonna sell 'em
for a big fat profit!

02:42.163 --> 02:44.374
Seems a bit dishonest.

02:44.374 --> 02:46.835
Tilly, you just don't understand
how business works.

02:46.835 --> 02:48.169
And you think you do?

Wake up, boy,

‐What's that now?
‐Bamboozled!

03:05.019 --> 03:06.771
Yeah! And a new sister!

03:06.771 --> 03:10.358
And they'll
appreciate my genius!

03:10.358 --> 03:12.443
I always wanted a sister.

03:12.443 --> 03:13.987
[Cricket]
Citizens of Big City!

03:13.987 --> 03:15.989
Are you tired of hats
that don't fit?

03:15.989 --> 03:18.575
Are you dissatisfied
with the diameter of your dome?

03:18.575 --> 03:20.285
Tiny heads
are the hot new trend!

03:20.285 --> 03:21.494
Don't be the last kid
on the block

03:21.494 --> 03:22.954
with a big ol' noggin!

03:22.954 --> 03:24.414
Benny, I'm looking
in your direction!

03:24.414 --> 03:25.915
People are counting on you

03:25.915 --> 03:27.792
to get their skulls ready
for bikini season!

03:27.792 --> 03:29.502
So... what do ya say?

03:29.502 --> 03:31.671
Uh, no thanks.
This is junk.

03:31.671 --> 03:35.633
I don't appreciate you preying
on my perceived insecurities.

03:35.633 --> 03:37.677
There's no shortcuts
to a slim head!

Aw, come on!

03:41.681 --> 03:43.558
[Cricket]
Ugh, I don't get it!

03:43.558 --> 03:45.435
Why won't people
buy this garbage?

03:45.435 --> 03:47.478
John made it sound so simple...

03:47.478 --> 03:48.813
Just tell 'em
what they wanna hear

03:48.813 --> 03:52.191
and they'll practically
sell themselves.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.402
Wait!
Is that what <i>I</i> wanted to hear?

03:54.402 --> 03:56.279
Am <i>I</i> the easy mark?

03:56.279 --> 03:57.947
Aw, Gramma was right!

03:57.947 --> 04:00.408
A hundred smackeroos
right down the drain!

04:00.408 --> 04:03.745
Sorry, Katelynn,
I can't afford to go
to the concert with you guys.

04:03.745 --> 04:05.622
Have fun without me.
[sighs]

04:05.622 --> 04:07.498
Money problems
are the worst.

04:07.498 --> 04:09.500
Tell me about it! I just
poured a bunch of money

04:09.500 --> 04:10.877
into these Skull Slimmers.

04:10.877 --> 04:13.087
The guy said
they'd sell themselves!

04:13.087 --> 04:15.173
Sell... themselves?

04:15.173 --> 04:16.674
That's what the guy said.

04:16.674 --> 04:17.884
He told me
I'd double my money.

04:17.884 --> 04:19.427
Whoa! Wait!

04:19.427 --> 04:21.471
‐Can I get in on this?
‐Uh, what now?

04:21.471 --> 04:24.307
If I double my money
I can go to that concert
with my friends!

04:24.307 --> 04:26.976
Wait, you <i>want</i>
to buy my Skull Slimmers?

04:26.976 --> 04:29.187
Yeah! How much
for the whole box?

04:29.187 --> 04:31.856
[clears throat] Well,
since we're such good pals,

04:31.856 --> 04:34.025
I'd be willin'
to let them go for...

04:34.025 --> 04:35.652
two hundred dollars?

04:35.652 --> 04:36.778
Sold!

04:36.778 --> 04:38.655
You really think
I can double my money?

04:38.655 --> 04:40.949
I did.

04:40.949 --> 04:44.911
This puzzle's impossible!
What's it even supposed to be?

04:44.911 --> 04:47.705
It's a picture
called "Starless Night."

04:47.705 --> 04:49.082
Why would you pick that?

04:49.082 --> 04:50.875
Oh, family!

04:50.875 --> 04:53.294
Guess who's not a sucker
after all?

04:53.294 --> 04:54.963
I sold the whole lot!

04:54.963 --> 04:57.131
Kiss my filthy bare feet!
Owie!

04:57.131 --> 04:59.926
Who on earth is dumb enough
to buy that junk?

04:59.926 --> 05:02.804
Why, if you must know,
our dear friend Gloria

05:02.804 --> 05:04.764
saw the true value
of Skull Slimmers.

05:04.764 --> 05:06.516
You scammed Gloria?

05:06.516 --> 05:08.226
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

05:08.226 --> 05:11.354
I simply offered her
the same business opportunity

05:11.354 --> 05:12.939
I enjoyed.

05:12.939 --> 05:14.816
‐Scam!
‐It's not a scam!

05:14.816 --> 05:18.361
Gloria just has to find
someone dumber than her
to buy them!

05:18.361 --> 05:20.321
But then what about that person?

05:20.321 --> 05:22.532
[grunting]
We don't even know them.

05:22.532 --> 05:24.742
Well, be forewarned, Cricket.

05:24.742 --> 05:28.871
The deceitful lifestyle
is a dark and endless void.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.373
Much like this puzzle!

05:30.373 --> 05:32.542
Which we will now have
to start over because of you.

05:32.542 --> 05:35.169
Gah! At least
let me do the edge pieces.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.337
There are none!

05:36.337 --> 05:37.755
Like outer space,
this puzzle

05:37.755 --> 05:39.799
is amorphous
and without borders.

05:39.799 --> 05:41.426
[sputters] Gah!

05:41.426 --> 05:43.428
Listen,
aren't you interested in

05:43.428 --> 05:44.762
a thinner, lighter skull?

05:44.762 --> 05:46.806
I just wanted a refill!

05:46.806 --> 05:49.726
No, wait! A think skull
is a healthy skull!

05:49.726 --> 05:51.728
Hey, Gloria!
How's the sales going?

05:51.728 --> 05:53.187
Cricket Green!

05:53.187 --> 05:55.857
What pack of lies
did you sell me?

05:55.857 --> 05:59.193
That's a heck of a way
to say good morning
to your li'l business buddy.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.945
Nobody wants
these stupid things.

06:00.945 --> 06:02.947
You totally conned me!

06:02.947 --> 06:04.741
Con is such a strong word.

06:04.741 --> 06:06.868
I never said
people didn't want any...

06:06.868 --> 06:09.078
and you didn't ask
if people did.

06:09.078 --> 06:13.166
So in a way,
didn't we con each other?

06:13.166 --> 06:15.501
‐[screaming]
‐[grunts]

06:15.501 --> 06:17.378
Gloria, please,
let's just talk this out!

06:17.378 --> 06:18.796
[screaming]

06:18.796 --> 06:20.214
Aah! Stay back, Gloria!

06:20.214 --> 06:21.507
You know, if you put
this kind of energy

06:21.507 --> 06:22.675
into your sales pitch...

06:22.675 --> 06:23.801
‐[grunts]
‐[screams]

06:23.801 --> 06:24.886

06:24.886 --> 06:26.637
Come here, Cricket!

06:26.637 --> 06:27.805
[screams]

06:27.805 --> 06:30.016
Oh, man,
Gloria's finally lost it!

06:30.016 --> 06:31.017
[grunts]

06:31.017 --> 06:32.643
Ahh, home free.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.771
‐[grunts]
‐Somebody save me!

06:34.771 --> 06:35.813
‐[grunting]
‐[screaming]

06:35.813 --> 06:37.148
Huh?

06:37.148 --> 06:39.484
Cricket Green,
you come back here!

06:39.484 --> 06:41.235
He probably deserves it.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.529
Gloria, no, please!
I'm your friend!

06:43.529 --> 06:46.866
Enough! Cricket,
just give me my money back
and this all stops.

06:46.866 --> 06:48.785
I spent it
already! Gah!

06:48.785 --> 06:50.119
What?

06:50.119 --> 06:51.913
I may, or may not,
have decided

06:51.913 --> 06:54.290
to spend the money
you gave me on this.

06:56.042 --> 06:59.796
You spent all of my money
on a wedding cake?

06:59.796 --> 07:01.881
It's just the biggest cake
I could buy.

07:01.881 --> 07:03.925
I don't care
if it's for a wedding.

07:03.925 --> 07:06.594
Then what are those?

07:06.594 --> 07:08.805
Well, excuse me if I wanted
to feel special on my big day.

07:08.805 --> 07:09.722
[grunts]

07:09.722 --> 07:11.682
Cricket,
that two hundred dollars

07:11.682 --> 07:13.893
was from my rent fund.

07:13.893 --> 07:17.688
If I don't make my money back,
I won't be able to pay my rent!

07:17.688 --> 07:20.358
Oh. Gee, I‐I didn't know that.

07:20.358 --> 07:21.818
Cake?

07:21.818 --> 07:23.236
Ha.

07:23.236 --> 07:25.154
[sighs]

07:26.739 --> 07:28.408
I'm really sorry, Gloria.

07:28.408 --> 07:30.576
I was just so desperate
not to look like a fool

07:30.576 --> 07:31.994
when I got flimflammed

07:31.994 --> 07:34.831
that I ended up
passin' my burden on to you.

07:34.831 --> 07:38.960
Yeah, well, scamming
someone else isn't the best way
to get out of a scam, dummy.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.711
[gasps] Or is it?

07:40.711 --> 07:42.797
I think I know a way
to get your money back.

07:42.797 --> 07:44.507
But we'll need some help.

07:44.507 --> 07:47.802
Ahh. Really brightens up
the office.

07:47.802 --> 07:49.053
‐[Gloria] Hey!
‐[gasps]

07:49.053 --> 07:51.139
Would you happen to be John?

07:51.139 --> 07:53.558
Might bees, might beesn't.

07:53.558 --> 07:57.520
I'm Gloria Hightower,
executive VP of acquisitions
for ThingieCorp Incorporated.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.939
Heard you're the man to see
about Skull Slimmers.

07:59.939 --> 08:02.233
Well, you're in luck.
I got tons of 'em!

08:02.233 --> 08:05.153
Hmm... No, this isn't
the model I'm looking for.

08:05.153 --> 08:07.447
‐The model? What do you mean?
‐Haven't you heard?

08:07.447 --> 08:08.948
There's a new version
of the Skull Slimmer

08:08.948 --> 08:10.283
that makes you super smart.

08:10.283 --> 08:11.742
If you had the new model,

08:11.742 --> 08:13.661
I would have
paid handsomely for them.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.080
Someone's selling Skull Slimmers
that make you smarter?

08:16.080 --> 08:20.543
Boy, I sure was
a real dumb‐dumb before
I bought my Skull Slimmer Plus!

08:20.543 --> 08:23.129
I purchased mine
with every dollar I had!

08:23.129 --> 08:24.464
Ho!

08:24.464 --> 08:25.631
Hey, kids,
where'd you get those?

08:25.631 --> 08:26.799
Why, from a young chap

08:26.799 --> 08:29.010
down the alley
on Grantham Avenue.

08:29.010 --> 08:30.678
He bought it!

08:30.678 --> 08:32.763
Yes, well, your acting
has really improved.

08:32.763 --> 08:35.099
Ooh. Huh? It's that kid.

08:35.099 --> 08:39.812
Yes, young man.
Here is my life savings
for the Skull Slimmer.

08:39.812 --> 08:41.147
[whispers] You owe me.

08:41.147 --> 08:42.857
Kid, I gotta hand it to ya.

08:42.857 --> 08:44.400
You were able to turn
that junk I sold ya

08:44.400 --> 08:45.943
into somethin'
people actually want.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.279
But now I'm gonna need
those Skull Slimmers back

08:48.279 --> 08:49.489
with whatever mods
you made to them.

08:49.489 --> 08:50.990
Here's your hundred bucks back.

08:50.990 --> 08:54.911
Sorry, John. The price
has gone up. [slurps]

08:54.911 --> 08:56.537
Fine. Two hundred bucks.

08:56.537 --> 08:58.831
Eh, nah. [slurps]

08:58.831 --> 09:01.751
Let me save us both some time.
What do ya say?

09:01.751 --> 09:04.253
That's a lot of money.

09:04.253 --> 09:07.131
‐So we got a deal?
‐Absolutely.

09:07.131 --> 09:09.467
Fantastic. Oops.

09:09.467 --> 09:12.261
Whoopsie‐daisy.

09:12.261 --> 09:13.971
‐Here ya go.
‐Thank you, sir.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.932
Pleasure doin' business with ya!

09:15.932 --> 09:17.767
What the...? Hey!

09:17.767 --> 09:19.894
This is just
a bunch of napkins!

09:19.894 --> 09:22.980
‐Pete never pays full price!
‐I thought your name was John!

09:22.980 --> 09:26.150
Yeah, that's what I meant.
John never pays full price!

09:26.150 --> 09:28.027
‐[laughs, gasps]
‐Stop right there!

09:28.027 --> 09:30.988
Agent William Walker,
Fraudulent Business Division.

09:30.988 --> 09:34.200
‐[gasps]
‐Just as I suspected.
Skull Slimmers.

09:34.200 --> 09:38.412
Somebody's been selling these
all over town under false claims
that they'll make you smarter.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.873
He sold these to me!
I'm the victim here!

09:40.873 --> 09:44.835
‐That true?
‐Gee, I'm just a kid,
holdin' a bag of napkins.

09:44.835 --> 09:48.256
Nothin' illegal about holdin' a
bag of napkins, right, Officer?

09:48.256 --> 09:50.508
Checks out.
Hope you like jail!

09:50.508 --> 09:53.553
Wait, wait, wait!
If I get away,
it's all yours.

09:53.553 --> 09:56.389
In all my years on the job,
I've never taken a bribe!

09:56.389 --> 09:58.474
Always wanted to see
what it's like.

09:58.474 --> 10:00.226
Go on, get outta here.

10:00.226 --> 10:01.811
You'll never see me again!

10:01.811 --> 10:04.355
Nice work, "Agent Walker."

10:04.355 --> 10:07.483
Finally,
theater classes pay off!

10:07.483 --> 10:10.486
Yeah! We flim‐flammed
the flim‐flam man!

10:10.486 --> 10:12.863
‐Here. This is for you.
‐What?

10:12.863 --> 10:15.575
But, Cricket,
don't you want your share?

10:15.575 --> 10:17.910
Nah, I feel bad
for scamming ya, Gloria.

10:17.910 --> 10:21.622
I even feel kinda bad
for scamming John. Or Pete?

10:21.622 --> 10:24.083
‐Yeah, don't.
‐You're right. I don't.

10:24.083 --> 10:28.337
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go to a concert
and pay my rent. Whoa!

10:28.337 --> 10:31.173
