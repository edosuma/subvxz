00:00.010 --> 00:04.210
Thomas Malone, convicted in 1994
for the murder of Lizzie Kilmuir.

00:04.760 --> 00:07.290
Her body was found inside a kiln on Unst.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.250
Why did you go after
Malone in the first place?

00:09.300 --> 00:11.530
A witness came forward
putting him on the Unst ferry

00:11.580 --> 00:12.970
the day Lizzie went missing.

00:13.020 --> 00:14.890
All I know is that if I hadn't spoken up,

00:14.940 --> 00:16.970
that pervert Malone might
have got away with it.

00:17.020 --> 00:19.290
Drew McColl called in. His
daughter seems to be missing.

00:19.340 --> 00:20.770
It looks like she was strangled.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.050
He did it then, and he's done it again.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.300
He's laughing at us, Jimmy!
He's laughing at all of us!

00:27.620 --> 00:29.690
I was able to cross-reference
Sally's movements

00:29.740 --> 00:32.930
with security footage from Norway
two minutes after she arrived.

00:32.980 --> 00:34.090
Hagan.

00:34.140 --> 00:35.650
Norway called. They've found Hagan.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.130
I thought I'd nip home and grab a bag.

00:37.180 --> 00:38.450
As long as you're up to it...

00:38.500 --> 00:40.690
The sample of DNA we
took from Allan Killick,

00:40.740 --> 00:43.170
it's a partial match for
the DNA found on the scarf

00:43.220 --> 00:44.970
used to strangle Lizzie Kilmuir.

00:45.020 --> 00:46.890
He wasn't even born
when Lizzie was murdered.

00:46.940 --> 00:48.450
No, I said a partial match.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.980
We have to find out who
that DNA belongs to, Jimmy.

02:17.380 --> 02:20.050
It is bad enough you dig
Kevin up in the first place

02:20.100 --> 02:23.370
without coming here and asking
me a question like that.

02:23.420 --> 02:25.170
It'll be a mistake.

02:25.220 --> 02:26.450
No mistake.

02:26.500 --> 02:27.740
It must be.

02:29.300 --> 02:34.650
Kevin's DNA isn't a match to the
DNA that we found on Lizzie's scarf,

02:34.700 --> 02:37.330
which means that it isn't
a match to Allan either.

02:37.380 --> 02:38.780
They're not related.

02:40.820 --> 02:42.020
Donna...

02:43.580 --> 02:45.420
.. who's Allan's real father?

02:49.140 --> 02:50.810
How is that your business?

02:50.860 --> 02:54.780
Because whoever he is, he's now a
suspect in Lizzie Kilmuir's murder.

03:01.860 --> 03:03.450
A man.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.930
Aye. I'd worked that out.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.700
That's all I can tell you.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.290
It was stupid, OK?

03:13.340 --> 03:17.210
Some rigger from down south I
met one night in The Claymore.

03:17.260 --> 03:19.060
I was drinking. A lot.

03:20.260 --> 03:22.330
I'm sure you can guess the rest.

03:22.380 --> 03:23.690
Did you get a name?

03:23.740 --> 03:26.460
I might have done but I was
in no fit state to remember.

03:29.340 --> 03:30.980
Did you try and trace him?

03:32.340 --> 03:34.010
Why would I?

03:34.060 --> 03:35.380
He's the father of your son.

03:36.420 --> 03:38.450
You never met my husband.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.930
Didn't take much to light his fuse.

03:40.980 --> 03:43.500
More often than not, that's
when the fists came out.

03:49.100 --> 03:51.250
If he'd even thought Allan
was another man's child,

03:51.300 --> 03:53.820
he would have made damn
sure Allan paid for it, too.

03:56.980 --> 03:59.890
Is there nothing that you can
tell me that would help me

03:59.940 --> 04:01.420
to trace this guy?

04:04.460 --> 04:06.100
I remember he was kind.

04:18.980 --> 04:20.700
You'll have to tell him.

04:22.940 --> 04:24.180
Donna.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.530
Allan's going to find out who
his dad is sooner or later.

04:27.580 --> 04:29.650
It's better if it comes from you.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.140
I'll need time.

04:32.420 --> 04:34.180
I can give you the morning.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.570
- You must be kidding.
- No, we have to find him.

04:42.620 --> 04:45.370
How? We don't have a name.
We don't have an address.

04:45.420 --> 04:48.540
All we know is that he worked
on the rigs 30 years ago.

04:49.860 --> 04:52.570
Billy? The Claymore pub?

04:52.620 --> 04:54.050
Closed down in the '90s.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.810
Right, do you remember
anybody who used to work there

04:56.860 --> 04:58.890
that we could still talk to?

04:58.940 --> 05:01.100
Jim Orr. He was the barman.

05:02.340 --> 05:04.020
Jim Orr, start with him.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.490
If we're lucky, maybe he'll
remember who this guy was.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.890
Oh, it'll take some feat of memory, that.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.970
What did Donna Killick say?

05:12.020 --> 05:17.050
Well, apparently Allan Killick is
the product of a one-night stand.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.780
- Who's the lucky bloke?
- She says she can't remember.

05:21.260 --> 05:23.730
But for the time being we
have to take her word for it.

05:23.780 --> 05:25.690
What about Hagan?

05:25.740 --> 05:28.620
Tosh is seeing Bergen Police this morning.

05:29.940 --> 05:31.460
And Tosh can handle it?

05:32.940 --> 05:34.410
Sure.

05:35.660 --> 05:36.930
Call from the hospital.

05:36.980 --> 05:38.210
And?

05:38.260 --> 05:39.700
Benny Ray's been attacked.

05:58.580 --> 06:00.450
DI Perez didn't travel with you?

06:00.500 --> 06:02.210
He had to stay on Shetland.

06:02.260 --> 06:04.650
But he said you might have
an idea where Hagan is.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.930
Hagan, he has a hunting cabin in Voss.

06:07.980 --> 06:10.490
We think that's where he's hiding out.

06:10.540 --> 06:12.690
You mean, no-one's checked?

06:12.740 --> 06:15.170
I'm not sure how it is
on Shetland, DS McIntosh,

06:15.220 --> 06:18.930
but here we try not to waste resources
chasing other forces' suspects.

06:18.980 --> 06:20.850
Of course. Understood.

06:20.900 --> 06:24.380
However, Detective Bleymann has
volunteered to drive you to Voss...

06:25.780 --> 06:27.480
.. despite this being his day off.

06:28.860 --> 06:31.330
Don't worry about her, she's
not always like that --

06:31.380 --> 06:33.980
just stressed because we
are merging departments.

06:34.780 --> 06:36.290
- Lars.
- Tosh.

06:36.340 --> 06:38.980
- Your name is Tosh?
- It's more of a nickname.

06:40.220 --> 06:42.660
- Sorry about your day off.
- No, no, don't be.

06:44.540 --> 06:46.220
I have no life.

07:13.540 --> 07:16.490
Jesus Christ, Benny. Who did this to you?

07:16.540 --> 07:18.410
Take a guess.

07:18.460 --> 07:20.090
Malone?

07:20.140 --> 07:21.900
Jumped me at the garage last night.

07:23.740 --> 07:26.140
Now, why would Thomas
Malone attack you, Benny?

07:30.100 --> 07:32.210
OK. What time did it happen?

07:32.260 --> 07:33.810
Just before midnight.

07:33.860 --> 07:35.330
Was there anybody else there?

07:35.380 --> 07:38.580
Malone's too smart to pull a stunt
like this in front of witnesses.

07:40.700 --> 07:41.900
What you doing here?

07:43.060 --> 07:44.380
Benny called me.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.810
Oh, is that right?

07:47.860 --> 07:49.380
Just here for moral support.

07:50.420 --> 07:53.290
Right, when you're feeling up to it,
I'll get somebody from the station

07:53.340 --> 07:56.540
- to come down and take your statement.
- He's not giving a statement.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.370
Why not?

07:58.420 --> 08:00.170
Fear of reprisal.

08:00.220 --> 08:02.730
If it wasn't for me, you
wouldn't even know about this.

08:02.780 --> 08:05.880
Without a statement, without
witnesses, you're tying my hands.

08:08.540 --> 08:10.260
Right. I'll talk to Malone.

08:20.780 --> 08:22.300
What's going on?

08:23.940 --> 08:27.490
Just wondering why Benny would chose
to call you before he called us.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.260
Me and Benny go back.

08:30.420 --> 08:31.970
That's what's worrying me.

08:32.020 --> 08:33.890
Sorry if you feel you
were passed over, Jimmy.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.970
But the fact remains that Malone
assaulted an innocent man.

08:37.020 --> 08:39.450
- He's hardly innocent.
- Benny's turning his life around.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.299
Yeah, he also tried to bury
Thomas Malone alive last week.

08:44.220 --> 08:47.010
Now, look, I know how
you feel about Malone

08:47.060 --> 08:48.740
but this isn't your case any more.

08:50.020 --> 08:52.060
You had your chance over 23 years ago...

08:53.420 --> 08:54.900
.. and you blew it.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.000
Hello?

09:40.380 --> 09:43.420
Apne opp! Det er politiet!

09:47.740 --> 09:49.970
All right. Stay here.

09:50.020 --> 09:52.370
I'm going to go round the
back and check the shore, OK?

09:52.420 --> 09:53.620
OK.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.100
Hello?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.540
Ikke ror deg.

10:42.980 --> 10:44.140
Snu deg!

10:45.220 --> 10:46.700
- I don't...
- Snu deg!

10:48.140 --> 10:50.450
I don't know what you're saying.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.740
Turn around.

10:58.940 --> 11:00.300
What are you doing here?

11:01.900 --> 11:05.060
I'm DS McIntosh. Shetland Police.

11:06.980 --> 11:08.620
I'm looking for Andreas Hagan.

11:09.980 --> 11:11.860
This is Detective Lars Bleymann.

11:16.660 --> 11:18.100
Dumb bitch.

11:19.260 --> 11:21.180
Lucky I didn't shoot you in the back.

11:32.240 --> 11:32.850
Thomas!

11:36.220 --> 11:37.460
Thomas. Open up!

11:39.300 --> 11:41.140
Err... the door's open.

11:43.060 --> 11:44.500
Where were you last night?

11:46.020 --> 11:48.250
- Er... I was here.
- Really?

11:48.300 --> 11:51.570
Cos Benny Ray said you were over
at his garage and you attacked him.

11:51.620 --> 11:53.660
- What? He said that?
- Oh, aye, he said that.

11:55.580 --> 11:58.250
- Well, he's lying.
- Why would he lie?

11:58.300 --> 12:00.450
The same reason he lied
about seeing me on the ferry

12:00.500 --> 12:02.050
the day Lizzie died...

12:02.100 --> 12:03.500
The man just doesn't like me.

12:07.780 --> 12:09.770
Do you want to go back to prison?

12:09.820 --> 12:11.650
Cos that's where this is heading.

12:11.700 --> 12:14.250
The whole island wants to see
you back inside and right now

12:14.300 --> 12:15.890
I'm struggling to disagree with them.

12:15.940 --> 12:18.690
- There's me thinking that
we were pals, eh? - Did you?

12:18.740 --> 12:20.810
I was prepared to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

12:20.860 --> 12:23.460
But after the stunt you pulled
at Benny's, that's done.

12:24.420 --> 12:26.650
You step out of line one more time,

12:26.700 --> 12:28.740
I'll drive you back to prison myself.

12:33.780 --> 12:36.930
You make such a big noise
about being innocent...

12:36.980 --> 12:38.730
That's because I am innocent.

12:38.780 --> 12:42.180
No. Innocent people don't go around
breaking other people's fingers.

12:48.260 --> 12:53.060
So, you came all the way to Norway
to talk to me about Sally McColl.

12:54.460 --> 12:56.460
Sally was murdered, Mr Hagan.

12:57.980 --> 13:00.690
And the reason I came all the way
out here is because you refused

13:00.740 --> 13:02.640
our requests for a formal interview.

13:18.580 --> 13:19.820
I'm on vacation.

13:21.700 --> 13:22.860
Right.

13:23.900 --> 13:28.580
Tell me -- your choice to come
here or did Forst Energy insist?

13:32.940 --> 13:34.570
What do you want?

13:34.620 --> 13:37.410
Sally McColl was investigating
you before she died.

13:37.460 --> 13:40.090
She was writing a story on a
cover-up -- your cover up --

13:40.140 --> 13:42.140
of the Forst Energy rig accident.

13:46.580 --> 13:49.890
The inquiry concluded that the incident

13:49.940 --> 13:51.410
was caused by a crew member.

13:51.460 --> 13:53.330
Danny Hamilton wasn't to blame.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.340
But the report says otherwise.

13:56.860 --> 13:59.660
Were you worried Sally was
about to publish her article?

14:03.060 --> 14:04.770
No.

14:04.820 --> 14:08.580
On the contrary. I wanted her to
publish it, so we could sue her.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.500
Where were you on the night she died?

14:15.780 --> 14:17.680
Were you at the Shetland folk festival?

14:18.820 --> 14:21.720
We have a witness who saw Sally
talking to a Norwegian man.

14:25.020 --> 14:26.180
That wasn't me.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.460
The last time I saw her was
in Bergen, three weeks ago.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.730
- You sure about that?
- Yes, I'm sure.

14:35.780 --> 14:37.380
Sally was in Bergen last week.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.770
I want you to leave now.

14:40.820 --> 14:43.120
- I have more questions.
- Then talk to my lawyer.

14:47.260 --> 14:49.370
Well, it sounds like you touched a nerve.

14:49.420 --> 14:50.970
Didn't get me very far, though.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.970
And nothing that could force an arrest.

14:53.020 --> 14:54.570
What's your gut on Hagan?

14:54.620 --> 14:57.620
Well, he's got motive to kill
Sally and his alibi is weak, but...

14:58.700 --> 14:59.810
But what?

14:59.860 --> 15:03.610
When I told him Sally was in Bergen
last week, he kind of freaked out.

15:03.660 --> 15:06.010
- Why would that freak him out?
- Dunno.

15:06.060 --> 15:08.770
But if she wasn't here to
see him, why was she here?

15:08.820 --> 15:10.930
Does that matter?

15:10.980 --> 15:12.570
I'd like to know.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.380
OK, well, see what you can find out.

15:18.740 --> 15:22.540
Any chance you could get me access
to the CCTV from Bergen airport?

15:23.900 --> 15:25.300
Yeah, sure.

15:31.140 --> 15:34.850
All those years and he
wasn't even my real dad.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.220
Was he a good dad, though?

15:37.660 --> 15:40.780
He was never a good man, far
from it. He was a bastard.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.400
Spent most of my childhood living in fear.

15:46.700 --> 15:47.980
There were good days, too?

15:49.180 --> 15:51.810
Every Friday he used to
get off early from work

15:51.860 --> 15:54.730
and pick up a Chinese on his way home

15:54.780 --> 15:57.010
and we'd sit in front of
the TV for a few hours.

15:57.060 --> 15:59.620
Before he got too drunk,
he was almost fun.

16:05.020 --> 16:06.720
Do you know what I've just realised?

16:07.700 --> 16:09.420
We've got four dads between us!

16:10.700 --> 16:13.410
- Yeah, you've got the best two.
- What makes you so sure?

16:13.460 --> 16:15.090
Well, one of mine's dead

16:15.140 --> 16:17.330
and the other might have
killed Lizzie Kilmuir.

16:17.380 --> 16:19.460
OK, fair enough.

16:24.020 --> 16:27.730
Look, whoever your real dad is...

16:27.780 --> 16:29.260
.. doesn't change who YOU are.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.540
Our parents don't define us.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.450
- Did you get anything from the barman?
- Nothing useful.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.850
Jim Orr's memory of his
time at The Claymore is hazy.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.810
So he didn't remember Donna Killick, then?

17:02.860 --> 17:06.329
Doesn't remember anything. I got the
feeling he took his wages in beer.

17:06.380 --> 17:11.490
OK, back in the '90s, most of the oil
workers were recruited through two agencies.

17:11.540 --> 17:14.730
- Best get on to them.
- And say what?

17:14.780 --> 17:17.450
"Is there any chance one of your
clients got a woman up the duff

17:17.500 --> 17:18.940
"back in the day?"

17:22.339 --> 17:23.740
Just find him, Sandy.

17:25.819 --> 17:27.930
What happened with Drew?

17:27.980 --> 17:29.570
Nothing. Why?

17:29.620 --> 17:31.530
He's just left a message on my phone.

17:31.580 --> 17:34.090
A five-minute drunken rant.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.210
He didn't make much sense
but the gist of it is,

17:36.260 --> 17:37.570
you're wrecking his life.

17:37.620 --> 17:39.650
Well, I think he's being
a wee bit overdramatic.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.330
You see, that's what I'm worried about.

17:41.380 --> 17:44.370
Drew has never expressed an emotion
in his life. Not before this!

17:44.420 --> 17:46.020
So, what happened at the hospital?

17:47.660 --> 17:51.330
Benny Ray says Malone attacked him.

17:51.380 --> 17:53.370
Drew was with him at the hospital.

17:53.420 --> 17:56.330
I felt he was interfering,
so we had some words.

17:56.380 --> 17:57.970
Did Malone attack Benny?

17:58.020 --> 18:01.410
- Aye, I think so.
- OK, I'm worried about Drew. Find him.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.100
Make sure he's OK.

18:09.300 --> 18:11.940
We think Sally landed round about now.

18:13.500 --> 18:14.780
There.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.980
What about arrivals?

18:19.780 --> 18:21.420
There, look, see -- there she is.

18:23.860 --> 18:25.620
Do you recognise that logo?

18:29.900 --> 18:31.690
Rask Tur.

18:31.740 --> 18:34.540
- It means fast ride.
- Taxi company. - Hmm.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.940
Hallo?

18:43.780 --> 18:46.540
Greit. Jeg er pa vei.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.300
I'm sorry. I have to
go. It's an emergency.

18:52.580 --> 18:55.140
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah, yeah, sure, don't worry.

19:38.340 --> 19:41.170
- Hi.
- Any chance you speak English?

19:41.220 --> 19:43.170
Yes, a little.

19:43.220 --> 19:46.610
I'm looking for information on this
woman. Her name's Sally McColl.

19:46.660 --> 19:51.610
I spoke with a taxi driver who
said he'd brought her here from
the airport last Tuesday afternoon.

19:51.660 --> 19:53.530
I don't recognise her.

19:53.580 --> 19:56.610
She was a journalist. I think she
might have been working on a story.

19:56.660 --> 19:59.940
Maybe she met someone here? Someone
who worked in the oil industry?

20:00.980 --> 20:02.780
If you could just take another look.

20:03.740 --> 20:05.810
She doesn't need another look.

20:05.860 --> 20:07.100
The woman wasn't here.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.740
Taxi driver said she was.

20:10.780 --> 20:12.690
Then he made a mistake.

20:12.740 --> 20:14.780
Maybe I could ask around?

20:43.140 --> 20:44.540
Drew!

21:24.020 --> 21:25.220
Drew!

21:27.180 --> 21:28.490
Drew!

21:28.540 --> 21:30.300
Drew, what the hell are you doing, man?

21:32.140 --> 21:33.410
What's it to you?

21:33.460 --> 21:35.410
Come on out of the water.

21:35.460 --> 21:36.960
You don't think much of me, do you?

21:38.260 --> 21:41.970
- Well, I think you're grieving. I think
you're in a lot of pain. - I mean as a cop.

21:42.020 --> 21:43.450
You don't think I was up to the job.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.770
You think I had to go
and frame your wee pal.

21:45.820 --> 21:47.930
Drew, come on back to the car.

21:47.980 --> 21:50.580
- Fine where I am.
- You'll freeze. - Good.

21:52.580 --> 21:55.420
Drew, did anybody ever tell
you you're a pain in the arse?

21:57.340 --> 21:58.970
The wife used to say that.

21:59.020 --> 22:01.140
Said I was too stubborn for my own good.

22:02.180 --> 22:03.260
I wish she was here.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.410
She would've found a way
to make sense of all this

22:07.460 --> 22:08.980
cos I sure as hell can't.

22:10.300 --> 22:12.210
I know how you feel.

22:12.260 --> 22:14.460
Trust me, I do.

22:15.820 --> 22:18.490
And there's nothing I can say that's
going to make this any easier.

22:18.540 --> 22:20.570
You can arrest Malone.

22:20.620 --> 22:23.260
- Drew, I'm not sure he did it.
- You're not sure?

22:24.860 --> 22:26.850
That how you work, Jimmy?

22:26.900 --> 22:28.690
It's all about how you feel?

22:28.740 --> 22:33.100
Give me one piece of evidence that
even suggests Malone is innocent.

22:34.580 --> 22:36.460
There's another suspect out there.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.650
The DNA and the scarf
isn't a match for Kevin.

22:42.700 --> 22:44.340
Allan's got a different father.

22:45.380 --> 22:46.770
Who?

22:46.820 --> 22:48.660
Donna says she cannae remember.

22:53.020 --> 22:54.540
Come on.

22:58.340 --> 23:00.580
Come on, eh?

23:17.620 --> 23:20.650
- I told you I can't help.
- Please. It's important.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.650
No. You're going to get me fired.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.930
- You remember her, don't you?
- No.

23:24.980 --> 23:26.780
She was murdered last week.

23:29.380 --> 23:31.490
She came here, didn't she?

23:31.540 --> 23:34.060
- Yes.
- Did she meet with someone?

23:38.260 --> 23:39.770
His name is Mati.

23:39.820 --> 23:43.170
I don't know his other name.
They just call him Mati.

23:43.220 --> 23:44.580
He's in the NDA.

23:45.940 --> 23:49.740
Norske Forsvaret Haeren.
Norwegian Defence Army.

23:50.780 --> 23:53.260
Far right. Like, er, fascists.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.130
Why was Sally meeting with him?

23:56.180 --> 23:59.490
Mati got angry and said
he was going to kill her.

23:59.540 --> 24:01.300
Then he threw her out of the bar.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.130
Where can I find this Mati?

24:04.180 --> 24:06.290
He hasn't been here since.

24:06.340 --> 24:07.970
Can you get me his address?

24:08.020 --> 24:11.380
Are you stupid? I don't want
to end up like your friend.

24:49.420 --> 24:50.700
Stay there.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.180
Take a look at this.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.490
What's that?

25:08.540 --> 25:11.730
Proof that Malone was more
than just a good suspect.

25:11.780 --> 25:13.090
That goes back years.

25:13.140 --> 25:17.010
Social work reports, interviews
with teachers, neighbours, friends.

25:17.060 --> 25:20.330
And all of them agree
that Malone was dangerous.

25:20.380 --> 25:22.370
So why wasn't it used in court?

25:22.420 --> 25:24.450
Hearsay. It was inadmissible.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.140
But it doesn't mean it's not true.

25:30.580 --> 25:32.740
When are you going to believe me, Jimmy?

25:57.020 --> 25:59.380
- Kate? - Thomas? - Er...

26:00.940 --> 26:02.690
I saw you through the window.

26:02.740 --> 26:05.570
Listen, about the phone...

26:05.620 --> 26:07.780
Look, it's fine. See, good as new.

26:11.020 --> 26:13.570
- Can I buy you a drink
anyway, or...? - Yeah.

26:13.620 --> 26:15.060
What do you want?

26:17.220 --> 26:20.250
Look, Thomas is going
to have a drink with us.

26:20.300 --> 26:22.210
He's not joining me.

26:22.260 --> 26:23.820
- He's a creep.
- Molly!

26:30.180 --> 26:31.900
Wait... Thomas!

27:01.300 --> 27:03.100
Seals giving you hell, were they?

27:17.380 --> 27:18.940
How was Allan?

27:23.660 --> 27:24.700
He told you, then?

27:25.780 --> 27:26.820
Of course he did.

27:30.740 --> 27:32.140
How is he feeling about that?

27:33.460 --> 27:35.700
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what?

27:36.820 --> 27:39.970
That thing you do when you pretend
we're having a normal conversation

27:40.020 --> 27:41.570
when really you're just working.

27:41.620 --> 27:44.090
You want to know how Allan
feels? Go and talk to him.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.660
I'm not your spy, Dad.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.260
Fine.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.210
Tosh.

28:03.260 --> 28:07.130
Last time Sally McColl was here, she
met with a Norwegian called Mati.

28:07.180 --> 28:10.050
He's part of some far-right
group based here in Bergen

28:10.100 --> 28:12.690
and I have a witness who saw
him threaten to kill her.

28:12.740 --> 28:15.330
I'm wondering if maybe she
was doing a story on them.

28:15.380 --> 28:18.890
I don't remember any mention
of far-right groups in her file.

28:18.940 --> 28:22.970
- What about the name Mati?
- I don't know, I'd need to go back and check.

28:23.020 --> 28:25.020
OK, well, call me if you find anything.

28:42.340 --> 28:44.730
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

28:44.780 --> 28:47.050
I just wanted to say sorry for before.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.450
There was just a little
problem with my grandfather.

28:49.500 --> 28:52.010
I'm sorry. Is he OK?

28:52.060 --> 28:55.700
Sure. He's in a hospital,
his mind is not so good.

28:57.540 --> 29:01.010
Anyway, I went back to the office
to check on the airport CCTV

29:01.060 --> 29:03.380
and I found Sally again on the way back.

29:04.420 --> 29:07.770
If you're not too busy right now,
I could show you what I found...

29:07.820 --> 29:09.260
.. maybe over a drink.

29:12.460 --> 29:15.020
- Sure. - Yeah? - Why not?

29:18.180 --> 29:21.410
This is just before she boarded
her flight back to Shetland.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.020
She's right there, see?

29:25.140 --> 29:28.090
- Do you see that?
- What am I looking at?

29:28.140 --> 29:30.180
There is some interaction, right?

29:31.420 --> 29:33.530
- You think I'm an idiot?
- No.

29:33.580 --> 29:37.490
I appreciate you bringing it to me.
I'm just not sure it's significant.

29:37.540 --> 29:39.700
It looks like she just asked her the time.

29:43.380 --> 29:45.730
But, now that you're here...

29:45.780 --> 29:48.500
.. maybe you could fill me in on the NDA.

29:49.660 --> 29:51.180
Why are you interested in them?

29:52.220 --> 29:55.820
I think Sally might have been doing
a story on a group here in Bergen.

29:58.060 --> 30:02.290
Ten years ago, groups like
the NDA, they were nowhere.

30:02.340 --> 30:05.890
But now, they have
organisation, they have money.

30:05.940 --> 30:08.500
They've gained support, become mainstream.

30:09.900 --> 30:12.690
We think that they're
behind a number of attacks

30:12.740 --> 30:14.450
on immigrant communities.

30:14.500 --> 30:17.610
But we are monitoring these
groups, you know, gathering names,

30:17.660 --> 30:19.450
so we can identify major players.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.050
Then there's a list?

30:23.340 --> 30:24.490
What?

30:24.540 --> 30:25.940
Do you ever stop working?

30:28.060 --> 30:29.460
What else is there to do?

30:31.260 --> 30:35.460
Lots. Drink, dance, have fun.

30:40.860 --> 30:42.060
It's not your scene?

30:43.460 --> 30:44.580
Something like that.

30:51.740 --> 30:54.730
- What is it with this country?
- Hmm? - You're all like super models.

30:54.780 --> 30:56.370
Makes me feel like a Hobbit.

30:56.420 --> 30:57.810
You haven't heard?

30:57.860 --> 31:00.210
Norway's a multicultural
paradise right now.

31:00.260 --> 31:01.690
Everyone is welcome here,

31:01.740 --> 31:03.220
especially Hobbits.

31:04.700 --> 31:07.650
So, erm... by the way,

31:07.700 --> 31:08.980
what is your real name?

31:10.500 --> 31:11.540
Alison.

31:13.980 --> 31:15.660
Yeah, I think I prefer Tosh.

31:17.100 --> 31:18.140
Me too.

31:38.460 --> 31:40.890
- Sir? - Looks as
though you were right...

31:40.940 --> 31:42.170
You found something?

31:42.220 --> 31:44.570
It's fragments mostly.

31:44.620 --> 31:48.250
Research notes, interview
transcripts, articles.

31:48.300 --> 31:51.570
But if you put them all together,

31:51.620 --> 31:55.690
then it looks as though Sally
was looking to do an article

31:55.740 --> 31:59.290
on the Scandinavian far right.

31:59.340 --> 32:00.690
Any mention of Mati?

32:00.740 --> 32:02.570
No, there's none that I can see.

32:02.620 --> 32:06.570
I mean, I did find a profile
on the NDA in her notes.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.690
You think that's why she was killed?

32:08.740 --> 32:13.170
Um... Hagan still has
motive and opportunity,

32:13.220 --> 32:15.530
but we can't rule it out.

32:20.020 --> 32:21.300
Tosh, can you hear me?

32:28.060 --> 32:29.100
Hello?

32:31.100 --> 32:32.700
There's someone in my room....

32:35.900 --> 32:37.020
- Aah!
- Tosh?

32:40.680 --> 32:43.210
- Aah!
- Tosh, are you there?

32:43.260 --> 32:45.570
Yeah, I'm here. I'm fine.

32:45.620 --> 32:46.850
What happened?

32:46.900 --> 32:48.890
Someone broke into my room.

32:48.940 --> 32:50.930
OK. Get out of there.
Get out of there now,

32:50.980 --> 32:52.970
go downstairs, go somewhere public.

32:53.020 --> 32:55.500
I'll phone through and
get some help for you, OK?

33:26.660 --> 33:31.450
Listen if you're worried about
something, you need to tell me.

33:31.500 --> 33:34.090
If you could just keep an eye
on Cassie, that'll be great.

33:34.140 --> 33:35.500
Is it about Allan Killick?

33:36.860 --> 33:38.220
I just need your help.

33:43.180 --> 33:45.010
Well, why didn't you just say?

33:46.060 --> 33:48.110
Go on. You'll miss your flight.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.300
I'll see you.

34:23.179 --> 34:26.050
I'm heading into town. I
wondered if you wanted to come.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.139
Not up for it.

34:29.179 --> 34:30.219
You all right?

34:31.219 --> 34:32.780
I saw Perez yesterday.

34:34.460 --> 34:35.940
Anything you want to tell me?

34:37.340 --> 34:38.500
Nothing I can think of.

34:47.540 --> 34:49.449
Right then.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.820
Call me when you're feeling more yourself.

35:22.060 --> 35:23.610
You found me, then.

35:23.660 --> 35:26.100
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Thanks.

35:27.100 --> 35:28.650
Anke take care of you?

35:28.700 --> 35:30.620
Sent some uniforms to the hotel.

35:32.620 --> 35:34.290
Look, I'm fine, really.

35:34.340 --> 35:36.780
They reckon it was just
a thief chancing his arm.

35:38.060 --> 35:39.380
I'm glad you're OK.

35:41.220 --> 35:42.500
I'm glad you're here.

35:44.700 --> 35:48.450
I spent the flight reading up on the NDA.

35:48.500 --> 35:51.090
I found this from a couple of years ago.

35:51.140 --> 35:54.980
It's an arson attack on a
current-affairs magazine in Oslo.

35:56.020 --> 35:58.810
Nobody was charged for it,
but they were about to do

35:58.860 --> 36:01.290
an expose on the NDA.

36:01.340 --> 36:02.570
The NDA did this?

36:02.620 --> 36:03.930
No, they couldn't prove it.

36:03.980 --> 36:07.130
But if Sally was trying to
dig the dirt on these guys,

36:07.180 --> 36:09.060
then that would've made her a target.

36:10.220 --> 36:12.540
So we need to talk to this guy, Mati.

36:17.340 --> 36:19.420
Sorry, it's out of the question.

36:32.540 --> 36:35.050
So we just need to look at the list.

36:35.100 --> 36:37.570
Not just any list -- an important list,

36:37.620 --> 36:39.420
a very sensitive list.

36:40.540 --> 36:43.130
I hear you're trying to merge departments.

36:43.180 --> 36:45.410
I'm trying to, yes.

36:45.460 --> 36:47.510
It's not an easy task, is it?

36:48.060 --> 36:48.690
It is not.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.650
The last thing in the
world you need really

36:50.700 --> 36:53.250
is a couple of foreign
cops getting in your way.

36:53.300 --> 36:54.340
Mm-hm.

36:55.780 --> 36:59.180
The sooner you let us see the list,
the sooner we're out of your hair.

37:23.100 --> 37:24.260
Allan?

37:32.380 --> 37:33.500
Allan?

37:41.880 --> 37:42.730
Allan?

37:42.980 --> 37:44.220
Just coming.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.650
Hi.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.370
The office is locked up.

37:49.420 --> 37:50.490
Aye, I know.

37:50.540 --> 37:53.490
- Are you having a clear out?
- No, my mum likes to tell everyone

37:53.540 --> 37:56.690
that she doesn't keep anything,
but I know her better that that.

37:56.740 --> 37:58.940
She's just as sentimental
as the rest of us.

38:02.820 --> 38:04.340
Come on. You can give us a hand.

38:09.900 --> 38:11.580
My real dad's in here somewhere.

38:15.620 --> 38:17.970
Can't we just access the database?

38:18.020 --> 38:20.490
No, Anke prefers it like this.

38:20.540 --> 38:23.090
Fascism must be popular in Norway.

38:23.140 --> 38:24.890
This is not all far right.

38:24.940 --> 38:28.370
We monitor Muslim radicals, anarchists,

38:28.420 --> 38:31.570
left-wing activists, hackers.

38:31.620 --> 38:33.860
Anyone we consider to
be a potential threat.

38:35.780 --> 38:37.130
What was this guy's name again?

38:37.180 --> 38:39.770
- Mati.
- Mathias Mati Soderland,

38:39.820 --> 38:43.450
active in far-right groups
for the past five years.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.980
He's based here in Bergen.

38:47.500 --> 38:50.140
OK, I'll go tell Anke.

38:57.380 --> 38:59.370
Look at you in your wee kilt.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.530
My mum bought me that
for a friend's wedding.

39:01.580 --> 39:02.860
It itched like mad.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.450
There's my mum.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.490
Let's put it back, put everything back.

39:13.540 --> 39:14.640
Quick, come on, hurry up.

39:21.620 --> 39:22.980
What are you doing in here?

39:24.180 --> 39:26.090
It's my house too.

39:26.140 --> 39:28.490
- What are doing with that?
- Watch what you're doing.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.170
Let me help.

39:30.220 --> 39:32.500
Leave it! Get your hands off.

39:33.900 --> 39:35.130
I should go.

39:35.180 --> 39:36.970
- Aye, you should.
- No, she can stay.

39:37.020 --> 39:38.700
I'll see you tomorrow, OK?

39:40.740 --> 39:42.570
You had no right to talk to her like that.

39:42.620 --> 39:44.220
My house, I'll talk as I please.

39:47.020 --> 39:49.410
What are you thinking?

39:49.460 --> 39:51.010
Sally isn't even in the ground

39:51.060 --> 39:53.090
and you're running around with a new girl.

39:53.140 --> 39:54.490
Look, Cass is a friend.

39:54.540 --> 39:55.730
She's Perez's daughter.

39:55.780 --> 40:00.370
- So? - So being around her is
just drawing attention to yourself.

40:00.420 --> 40:03.500
Look, the only person that Perez
is interested in here is you.

40:05.260 --> 40:06.410
What do you mean about that?

40:06.460 --> 40:09.450
Whoever my father was, well, he was
close to Lizzie before she died.

40:09.500 --> 40:12.090
And this "Rigger from
England" story that's...

40:12.140 --> 40:13.850
that's not fooling anyone.

40:13.900 --> 40:15.140
Get out!

40:27.820 --> 40:30.370
Mati Soderland. Born in Bergen,

40:30.420 --> 40:32.300
4th of September, 1989.

40:33.620 --> 40:37.050
Soderland has been an active member
of the NDA for the past ten months.

40:37.100 --> 40:39.090
That's the guy from last night.

40:39.140 --> 40:40.420
He was the one in my room.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.050
So what do we know about him?

40:44.100 --> 40:46.050
A history of assault on women.

40:46.100 --> 40:50.090
Two years ago he was charged
with rape and attempted murder.

40:50.140 --> 40:52.410
And he's still walking free?

40:52.460 --> 40:53.820
The charges were dropped.

40:55.180 --> 40:56.220
So what now?

40:57.260 --> 40:58.730
Eh, give the mug-shot to Sandy,

40:58.780 --> 41:01.410
see if he can get Jo to identify him.

41:01.460 --> 41:04.540
If he was charged, you'd still
have his prints on file, right?

41:06.020 --> 41:07.380
We'll get them, yeah.

41:09.380 --> 41:10.500
And in the meantime?

41:12.500 --> 41:13.810
We'll need his address.

41:13.860 --> 41:15.820
Yep, OK.

41:29.940 --> 41:30.980
Thomas?

41:34.580 --> 41:36.450
Thomas?

41:36.500 --> 41:37.540
OK.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.610
Hello.

41:43.660 --> 41:44.780
How you doing?

41:46.380 --> 41:48.300
- Come in.
- Thanks.

41:49.940 --> 41:53.210
Molly had no right to speak to
you in that way, she's just...

41:53.760 --> 41:54.620
It's fine.

41:57.820 --> 41:59.970
Is that water cold?

42:00.020 --> 42:03.090
Aye, the generator's gone off again.

42:03.140 --> 42:04.420
Well, how are you cooking?

42:09.620 --> 42:12.770
Right, that's it. Come on, let's go.

42:12.820 --> 42:14.330
- Look, Kate, it's fine.
- No.

42:14.380 --> 42:16.570
Now, you can put a wash on at mine,

42:16.620 --> 42:18.810
and we'll get some proper
food in you. Come on.

42:18.860 --> 42:20.530
- Are you sure?
- Get your coat on.

42:20.580 --> 42:21.620
OK.

42:33.740 --> 42:35.170
Mrs Soderland?

42:35.220 --> 42:36.410
Yes.

42:36.460 --> 42:38.370
Eh, do you speak English?

42:38.420 --> 42:40.370
Yes, I do. A little.

42:40.420 --> 42:43.410
I'm DI Perez, this is DS Macintosh,

42:43.460 --> 42:45.340
we're from the Shetland Police...

42:47.500 --> 42:50.570
.. and we're looking for your son Mati.

42:52.780 --> 42:58.530
Mati, he... He hasn't lived here
for a good number of years. Ah.

42:58.580 --> 43:00.330
Do you know where he is now?

43:00.380 --> 43:01.730
No.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.610
Not even a contact address?

43:03.660 --> 43:05.290
No, I'm afraid not.

43:05.340 --> 43:09.620
My son and I haven't talked in many years.

43:13.060 --> 43:16.250
- Would you like to come inside?
- Uh-huh. Thank you.

43:16.300 --> 43:17.460
Please.

43:24.260 --> 43:27.370
Mati and I are different people.

43:27.420 --> 43:30.490
He-he took after his father, you see,

43:30.540 --> 43:36.650
and, unfortunately, he
left when Mati was young

43:36.700 --> 43:39.370
and I was no substitute.

43:39.420 --> 43:41.780
So, as soon as he was old enough...

43:43.300 --> 43:45.530
.. Mati left home.

43:45.580 --> 43:47.530
Oh, for the oil industry?

43:47.580 --> 43:50.810
No, he worked on cargo ships.

43:50.860 --> 43:52.730
But then something happened.

43:52.780 --> 43:55.330
He lost his job, so he
stopped going to sea,

43:55.380 --> 43:56.700
stopped coming home.

43:59.060 --> 44:01.460
Was Mati interested in politics?

44:05.180 --> 44:07.610
Was he involved with the NDA?

44:07.660 --> 44:12.690
All I can say is that he began
to hold some very extreme views.

44:12.740 --> 44:14.730
Ugly, ugly ideas.

44:14.780 --> 44:18.210
Mrs Soderland, we are
investigating the murder

44:18.260 --> 44:19.980
of a young woman in Shetland...

44:21.500 --> 44:25.130
.. and we have reason to
believe that she and Mati

44:25.180 --> 44:27.500
may have had an argument recently.

44:29.340 --> 44:33.020
And you think Mati killed this woman?

44:34.340 --> 44:35.660
Would that surprise you?

44:38.500 --> 44:39.580
No.

44:50.220 --> 44:51.420
Thank you.

45:16.500 --> 45:19.940
Yeah, I keep it the same. No idea why.

45:24.940 --> 45:27.370
He was always called Mati?

45:27.420 --> 45:30.580
Yes, he never liked Mathias.

45:44.700 --> 45:45.980
Sir?

45:51.900 --> 45:54.380
Do you mind if we have
a look through this?

46:12.540 --> 46:15.340
- Mrs Soderland? - Yes? - Is this Mati?

46:16.420 --> 46:19.180
Yes, that's him with his father.

46:22.100 --> 46:23.540
Tosh.

46:27.060 --> 46:29.090
His father is Andreas Hagan?

46:29.140 --> 46:30.540
Yes.

46:32.180 --> 46:35.290
Why was Sally McColl running around
Bergen meeting with Hagan's son?

46:35.340 --> 46:39.370
I don't know. There's
only one way to find out.

46:42.620 --> 46:44.170
Anke?

46:44.220 --> 46:46.450
We don't have Mati Soderland's prints.

46:46.500 --> 46:49.010
But he was arrested,
processed and charged --

46:49.060 --> 46:50.730
they must have taken them.

46:50.780 --> 46:53.250
Of course. That's procedure.

46:53.300 --> 46:55.650
Right, well, so where are they, then?

46:55.700 --> 46:58.010
Maybe they're lost or were mixed up.

46:58.060 --> 47:01.730
OK. Well, thanks anyway.

47:01.780 --> 47:03.340
Is everything OK?

47:07.460 --> 47:09.100
Let's go see Hagan.

48:14.460 --> 48:16.810
He isn't the same man your
boss showed me the other day.

48:16.860 --> 48:19.010
No. This is another guy.

48:19.060 --> 48:22.850
- What happened to the other man?
- We're looking at them both.

48:22.900 --> 48:26.170
Is there any chance this was
the one you saw talking to Sally

48:26.220 --> 48:27.700
at the festival?

48:32.060 --> 48:33.380
I don't know.

48:34.700 --> 48:37.210
Before, I thought it was the other
man but maybe it was this one.

48:37.260 --> 48:40.020
- It's hard to remember.
- Were you even at the festival?

48:42.460 --> 48:44.370
Sorry.

48:44.420 --> 48:46.330
All this is...

48:46.380 --> 48:49.900
It's as frustrating for
me as it is for you.

48:52.060 --> 48:53.820
You think this Malone killed her.

48:55.060 --> 48:57.380
It wasn't Malone I saw with her.

49:02.100 --> 49:04.100
Why don't you take another look?

49:07.340 --> 49:09.500
How does this thing even work?

49:11.820 --> 49:13.450
You're kidding.

49:13.500 --> 49:15.050
No.

49:15.100 --> 49:17.530
You don't know how to
use a washing machine?

49:17.580 --> 49:19.290
Not one like this.

49:19.340 --> 49:22.490
My mother had one, but
that was about 20 year ago.

49:22.540 --> 49:25.450
This thing looks like
it was built by NASA.

49:25.500 --> 49:27.770
So no laundries in prison neither?

49:27.820 --> 49:31.930
- Some do. Some send all the washing
out to other prisons, too. - Uh-huh.

49:31.980 --> 49:36.290
- Friday was laundry day. It
was a waste of time. - Why?

49:36.340 --> 49:38.970
You always ended up getting
somebody else's kit back.

49:39.020 --> 49:41.010
Even their underwear?

49:42.560 --> 49:43.410
Especially underwear.

49:43.460 --> 49:45.970
- Well, it's not all bad, then?
- It's not funny, y'know?

49:46.020 --> 49:47.580
What the hell is this?

49:50.300 --> 49:52.250
What is he doing here?!

49:52.300 --> 49:55.770
Molly. Molly.

49:55.820 --> 49:59.060
Molly, please. Come back. Come back here.

50:01.940 --> 50:03.730
Molly!

50:03.780 --> 50:06.780
Molly, come back. Where
are you going, Molly?

50:27.620 --> 50:28.780
Molly?

50:31.100 --> 50:32.690
You OK, Molly?

50:32.740 --> 50:35.620
You all right? Hey, what's happened?

50:38.340 --> 50:40.540
Hey, it's OK.

50:53.980 --> 50:55.930
I didn't do it.

50:55.980 --> 50:59.180
Killing journalists is just not my style.

51:01.580 --> 51:03.780
Is it your son Mati's style?

51:09.580 --> 51:12.300
Why did he meet Sally McColl?

51:14.140 --> 51:15.980
I took care of everything.

51:17.820 --> 51:19.850
Made sure there were no loose ends.

51:19.900 --> 51:22.570
Once she couldn't find
anything on the accident,

51:22.620 --> 51:24.660
she started to look into me instead.

51:27.420 --> 51:31.250
OK, so that's how she found Mati?

51:31.300 --> 51:34.170
Last time we met,

51:34.220 --> 51:37.290
she said that if I didn't tell
her the truth about the accident,

51:37.340 --> 51:39.410
she'd expose Mati and....

51:39.460 --> 51:41.540
Embarrassing for you.

51:43.100 --> 51:45.530
More than embarrassing.

51:45.580 --> 51:47.130
It's not only me.

51:47.180 --> 51:50.810
Poor Nina would not have
coped if everyone knew.

51:50.860 --> 51:53.660
So how long has Mati been NDA?

51:54.700 --> 51:58.100
Nina warned me years ago that
he was getting involved but...

51:59.540 --> 52:01.530
.. I thought it was only a phase.

52:01.580 --> 52:05.970
What did you say when Sally
threatened to expose your son?

52:06.020 --> 52:07.940
I warned her to be careful.

52:09.420 --> 52:12.690
It doesn't look like she took your advice.

52:12.740 --> 52:14.100
She did track down Mati.

52:15.700 --> 52:19.090
- Then he threatened to kill her.
- Mati wouldn't hurt anyone.

52:19.140 --> 52:21.100
Or at least not the Mati I knew.

52:22.740 --> 52:24.930
Did he ever visit you in Shetland?

52:24.980 --> 52:26.140
No.

52:27.220 --> 52:29.260
He saw me as the enemy.

52:30.460 --> 52:34.340
A corporate vampire, draining the
lifeblood of this proud nation.

52:36.340 --> 52:40.290
So if he had been at that festival,

52:40.340 --> 52:44.220
you wouldn't have necessarily
have known about it?

52:47.940 --> 52:50.650
Look, Mr Hagan,

52:50.700 --> 52:55.170
the best thing you can do is
to help us track down Mati,

52:55.220 --> 52:58.300
because then we can
eliminate him as a suspect.

53:07.260 --> 53:10.210
Even though Mati hates me,

53:10.260 --> 53:13.900
he has no problem taking my money.

53:15.180 --> 53:16.980
This is where I send it.

53:20.340 --> 53:22.420
If you find him, tell him....

53:25.580 --> 53:27.580
Tell him his father loves him.

53:49.940 --> 53:52.850
So why did you stay?

53:52.900 --> 53:55.140
After Lizzie, I mean.

53:57.260 --> 53:58.980
Didn't you want to leave?

54:00.660 --> 54:02.730
I wanted to.

54:02.780 --> 54:04.450
Mm-hm?

54:04.500 --> 54:06.330
But I...

54:06.380 --> 54:09.100
I felt that if I went I
would be abandoning her.

54:10.340 --> 54:11.620
Aye.

54:15.420 --> 54:17.700
What about you? Why did you come back?

54:22.740 --> 54:24.220
Shetland is my home.

54:25.500 --> 54:27.900
It's not been that for a long time.

54:30.860 --> 54:32.540
To prove a point.

54:36.420 --> 54:38.860
To look everyone in the eye.

54:41.540 --> 54:44.290
And to let them know I'm a...

54:44.340 --> 54:45.900
I'm a good man.

54:52.420 --> 54:54.100
I'll get some more wine.

54:55.380 --> 54:57.460
I think you are a good man.

54:58.660 --> 55:00.180
No. No...

55:15.260 --> 55:17.170
I'm not going in there.

55:17.220 --> 55:19.970
Whatever's going on
between you and your mum,

55:20.020 --> 55:21.700
you need to talk.

55:51.420 --> 55:52.620
Molly?

56:19.940 --> 56:24.820
- I'll give Lars a call. See if he can
meet at Soderland's tomorrow. - OK.

56:34.340 --> 56:36.780
Tosh, let's take a walk.

56:41.900 --> 56:43.730
What's going on?

56:43.780 --> 56:46.780
The black van behind us, it's
been following us all day.

56:48.420 --> 56:50.330
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

56:50.380 --> 56:52.220
And I don't want to find out.

57:06.660 --> 57:08.020
Go left.

57:09.305 --> 57:15.287
