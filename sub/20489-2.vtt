00:01.521 --> 00:05.023
===MUTANT X I Scream The Body Electric / s01.ep02===

00:05.372 --> 00:06.873
ONE THING'S FOR SURE;

00:06.873 --> 00:08.992
IT'S GETTING WEIRDER
OUT THERE EVERY DAY.

00:10.126 --> 00:12.162
NO NEED TO RUN ANYMORE, EMMA.

00:12.162 --> 00:14.164
YOU'RE AMONG FRIENDS.

00:14.164 --> 00:16.666
I HAVE BEEN MANDATED TO CREATE
THE GENETIC SECURITY AGENCY

00:16.666 --> 00:19.669
TO PROTECT THE WORLD
FROM THIS RAPACIOUS MENACE.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.093
A TEENAGE
GIRL FALLS SIX STORIES,
THEN WALKS AWAY UNSCATHED.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.696
HELP ME.

00:32.916 --> 00:34.918
WE CAN'T LET SOMEONE WITH
HER ABILITY TO MANIPULATE THE

00:34.918 --> 00:37.420
FEELINGS OF OTHERS BECOME
THE TOOL OF OUR WORST NIGHTMARE.

00:39.189 --> 00:40.924
SHE'S HEADED FOR THE SKYCOURSE.

00:41.925 --> 00:43.009
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

00:43.009 --> 00:44.244
NO, IT'S NOT, IS IT?

00:44.761 --> 00:45.295
BRENNAN.

00:47.947 --> 00:48.481
STOP.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.483
LET THEM GO.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.502
THIS ISN'T OVER YET.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.688
I'M SO SORRY.

00:55.688 --> 00:57.190
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
CAUSE ALL THIS TROUBLE.

00:57.190 --> 01:00.260
AND NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
THE DANGER WE'RE ALL IN.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:45.525 --> 03:48.478
ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE
IS A WASTE OF TIME.

03:56.152 --> 03:58.488
YOU'RE STILL AN HOUR
OFF YOUR GAME, MR MULWRAY.

04:07.897 --> 04:09.749
NOW, YOU KEEP PLAYING HARD
TO GET AND YOU'RE IN FOR THE

04:09.749 --> 04:11.601
WORLD'S WORST NIGHTMARE.

04:11.601 --> 04:12.852
DON'T BE SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

04:12.852 --> 04:15.355
ANY NIGHTMARE
YOU CAN DISH OUT WILL
BE LIKE A SWEET DREAM TO ME.

04:29.452 --> 04:32.622
THAT'S ENOUGH, MR THORNE.

04:32.622 --> 04:35.141
I'D PREFER HIM IN ONE PIECE.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.157
YOU WANT STRANGE?

05:58.157 --> 06:00.159
I'LL GIVE YOU STRANGE.

06:00.159 --> 06:03.162
WE GET A CALL
ON THE HOTLINE ABOUT A GUY
WHO CONTROLS ELECTRICITY.

06:03.162 --> 06:05.164
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT BRENNAN.

06:05.164 --> 06:07.200
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
A GUY FITTING THAT DESCRIPTION

06:07.200 --> 06:09.085
RUNS RAMPANT DOWNTOWN.

06:09.085 --> 06:10.103
SILENT RECORD.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.105
THIS IS BECOMING
TIRESOME, EMMA.

06:12.605 --> 06:14.107
WHY DID WE HAVE
TO RESCUE YOU AGAIN?

06:14.674 --> 06:16.692
I'VE APOLOGIZED
A DOZEN TIMES, ADAM.

06:16.692 --> 06:18.461
WHAT DO I HAVE TO SAY
TO CONVINCE YOU I'M SORRY?

06:18.978 --> 06:20.997
I'M SURE THAT YOU'RE
SINCERE IN YOUR REGRETS.

06:20.997 --> 06:22.999
BUT YOUR ACTIONS CONTINUE
TO PUT US IN JEOPARDY.

06:22.999 --> 06:27.186
I'M JUST
CONFUSED AND AFRAID.

06:27.186 --> 06:28.755
WE'RE ALL AFRAID.

06:28.755 --> 06:31.257
BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WALK AROUND
CONSTANTLY ASSAULTED BY

06:31.758 --> 06:33.843
OTHER PEOPLE'S
FEELINGS AND TERRORS.

06:33.843 --> 06:35.344
YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:35.344 --> 06:36.846
MAYBE IT'S
TIME THAT YOU LOOKED
AT YOUR WORLD FROM A

06:36.846 --> 06:38.347
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

06:38.848 --> 06:42.385
AND YOU TAKE WHAT
YOU SEE AS A PROBLEM AND
YOU MAKE IT A SOLUTION.

06:42.385 --> 06:44.036
THAT'S WHAT
SAVED MY LIFE.

06:45.588 --> 06:48.641
YOU KNOW, IT'S
NOT LIKE WE WERE THRILLED TO
BE SO DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW?

06:48.641 --> 06:54.730
BUT WITH A LITTLE WORK, BEING
A NEW MUTANT CAN BE FABULOUS.

06:54.730 --> 06:56.282
OR YOU CAN
END UP LIKE THORNE.

06:56.282 --> 06:58.684
WELL, I'LL TAKE
FABULOUS ANYTIME.

06:58.684 --> 07:02.722
BREEDLOVE'S DEATH HAS SET EVENTS
IN MOTION THAT ARE GOING TO

07:02.722 --> 07:04.824
CHANGE OUR LIVES FOREVER.

07:05.324 --> 07:08.327
THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.

07:08.327 --> 07:10.379
WHAT ABOUT BRENNAN?

07:10.379 --> 07:13.416
WE'LL DO WHATEVER
WE CAN TO GET HIM OUT.

07:13.416 --> 07:15.468
ASSUMING HE STILL
WANTS TO GET OUT.

07:20.623 --> 07:23.910
YOU LET
MS DELAURO GET AWAY.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.912
YES.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.915
THAT'S PRIMARILY DUE
TO MR MULWRAY'S INTERFERENCE.

07:28.915 --> 07:32.001
HOWEVER, NOW WE CAN
USE MULWRAY TO ENTRAP HER.

07:32.535 --> 07:38.257
YOU ALWAYS FIND THE POSITIVE
IN A NEGATIVE, MR THORNE.

07:38.257 --> 07:44.363
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO
MAKE SOMETHING OF MR MULWRAY.

07:44.363 --> 07:48.885
BUT RATHER THAN EXPENDING ALL
OUR RESOURCES IN SEARCHING FOR

07:48.885 --> 07:55.675
ALL THESE LOST SOULS, LET'S FIND
ONE TO BRING THE OTHERS TO US.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.922
SO, WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

08:09.922 --> 08:11.657
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S
BEEN HITTING THE FAN LATELY,

08:11.657 --> 08:13.793
WE WANTED YOU ALL TO BE ABLE
TO GET OUT AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.

08:13.793 --> 08:16.279
YOU KNOW,
I'M STILL NOT SURE WHY
ADAM THINKS IT'S NECESSARY

08:16.279 --> 08:18.731
TO SET UP
A SECOND SAFE HOUSE.

08:18.731 --> 08:21.751
YEAH, THE ONE BEHIND
MY BOOK STORE'S FINE.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.519
ABSOLUTELY.

08:24.103 --> 08:25.938
BUT IT NEVER HURTS
TO BE TOO CAREFUL.

08:41.453 --> 08:46.259
WE'VE BEEN WAITING TO MEET YOU
FOR A LONG TIME, MR MULWRAY.

08:46.893 --> 08:48.144
OH, YEAH, IS THAT RIGHT?

08:48.761 --> 08:51.697
YOU AND MS DELAURO
ARE HIGH ON MY...

08:52.198 --> 08:55.051
SHOPPING
LIST OF ANOMALIES.

08:55.051 --> 08:57.904
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT FEELS
SO GOOD TO BE SO WANTED.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.526
MR ECKHART DOES
NOT HAVE TIME FOR SARCASM.

09:22.228 --> 09:25.197
THIS IS GOING TO HURT.

09:41.330 --> 09:45.084
NOW, WE'VE JUST IMPLANTED
YOU WITH A DEVICE CALLED

09:45.084 --> 09:47.486
A SUB-DERMAL GOVERNOR.

09:47.486 --> 09:53.042
SOMETHING MY PEOPLE CREATED
ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

09:53.042 --> 09:56.062
IT CONNECTS US
DIRECTLY WITH YOUR DNA.

09:56.062 --> 10:00.600
SO THAT WHENEVER YOU USE
YOUR ABILITIES WITHOUT OUR

10:01.117 --> 10:05.871
APPROVAL,
THE PAIN IS DEBILITATING.

10:05.871 --> 10:08.124
BRING IT ON.

10:08.124 --> 10:10.376
WELL, ALRIGHT THEN MR MULWRAY.

10:10.876 --> 10:13.379
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.264
RELEASE HIM.

10:34.183 --> 10:36.435
WELL, GIVE US YOUR BEST SHOT.

10:53.436 --> 10:56.339
WELL...

10:56.339 --> 11:00.092
I GATHER WE ALL HAVE A BETTER
IDEA OF JUST WHAT YOU CAN TAKE.

11:00.092 --> 11:02.278
DON'T YOU THINK?

11:06.465 --> 11:09.852
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO
REDEEM A MISSPENT LIFE.

11:09.852 --> 11:12.321
AN OPPORTUNITY
TO PROTECT THE WORLD
FROM GENETIC TERRORISM

11:12.938 --> 11:16.075
AS AN OPERATIVE OF THE
GENETIC SECURITY AGENCY.

11:16.692 --> 11:19.545
MR THORNE WILL
GIVE YOU THE DETAILS.

11:23.249 --> 11:27.319
YOU KNOW, I THINK
THE TWO OF US SHOULD
JUST TRY TO GET ALONG.

11:27.319 --> 11:30.056
IF YOU BELIEVE THAT,
YOU'RE CRAZIER THAN HE IS.

11:33.159 --> 11:36.979
SEE,
THERE'S A SECOND FEATURE WHICH
MR ECKHART NEGLECTED TO MENTION.

11:36.979 --> 11:42.385
I HAVE THE ABILITY TO
TURN IT BOTH ON... AND OFF.

11:46.989 --> 11:49.742
I CAN GIVE YOU
A LITTLE JOLT FROM TIME TO
TIME TO KEEP YOU IN LINE.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.584
YOU COMING?

12:00.252 --> 12:02.621
WHAT DO I KNOW
ABOUT BEING A HERO?

12:02.621 --> 12:05.541
I SELL MISSES AND PETITES,
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES.

12:05.541 --> 12:10.129
AND I GATHER
YOU WERE UNUSUALLY GOOD AT
IT, BECAUSE OF YOUR GIFTS.

12:10.129 --> 12:15.418
I'LL ADMIT IT, I DID MANIPULATE
CUSTOMERS OCCASIONALLY.

12:15.418 --> 12:18.204
OFTEN.

12:18.204 --> 12:21.340
ALRIGHT,
EVERY CHANCE I GOT BUT
IT DIDN'T ALWAYS WORK.

12:21.340 --> 12:24.927
WHEN DID
YOU FIRST REALIZE THAT
YOU HAD THESE GIFTS?

12:24.927 --> 12:28.948
WHEN I WAS A KID.

12:28.948 --> 12:31.600
MAYBE FIVE.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.370
I WAS AT THIS ROCK
FESTIVAL WITH MY PARENTS.

12:34.370 --> 12:37.673
I GOT SEPARATED FROM THEM.

12:38.190 --> 12:41.844
TOTALLY LOST IN THE CROWD.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.281
THEY WERE BOTH
ON THE FLAKY SIDE.

12:45.281 --> 12:49.401
WHEN I REALIZED
THEY WERE GONE,

12:49.401 --> 12:51.403
I CLOSED
MY EYES AND IT WAS

12:51.403 --> 12:53.973
LIKE I SAW MY
PARENTS IN A DREAM.

12:53.973 --> 12:59.278
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS YOU FOUND THEM?

12:59.278 --> 13:02.148
YEAH, BUT THEY
FIGURED THEY'D FOUND ME.

13:02.731 --> 13:06.302
THEY RAN OFF
WHEN I WAS TEN AND LEFT
ME IN A FOSTER HOME.

13:06.302 --> 13:10.790
BY THAT TIME,
I DIDN'T CARE IF
THEY FOUND ME OR NOT.

13:10.790 --> 13:15.394
HMM.

13:19.281 --> 13:22.868
MR ECKHART, THIS IS THE MAN YOU
REQUESTED FOR YOUR INTERVIEW.

13:26.205 --> 13:30.910
MY NAME
IS MASON ECKHART.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.462
AH, YOU'VE HEARD OF ME.

13:33.462 --> 13:37.516
I GATHER YOU'RE A TELEPATH.

13:37.516 --> 13:40.019
PLEASE, MR BISHOP,
WE HAVE NO SECRETS HERE.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.071
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

13:42.638 --> 13:43.873
I'M AN ESPER.

13:43.873 --> 13:45.958
FINE.

13:53.949 --> 13:59.288
NOW, TELL ME WHAT YOU
SEE WHEN YOU READ MY MIND.

13:59.288 --> 14:02.157
UNLESS YOU'D LIKE ME TO
HAVE MR THORNE CONVINCE YOU.

14:22.528 --> 14:26.232
NOW THAT YOU KNOW
THAT EVERYTHING YOU'VE
HEARD ABOUT ME IS TRUE,

14:26.232 --> 14:30.419
I WANT YOU
TO HELP ME BRING THE REST
OF YOUR FRIENDS TO JUSTICE.

14:47.002 --> 14:49.388
I DON'T
THINK ADAM LIKES ME.

14:49.388 --> 14:53.042
IT'S NOT IN ADAM'S
NATURE TO DISLIKE ANYONE.

14:53.042 --> 14:56.078
HE'S A REMARKABLE MAN.

14:56.078 --> 14:59.498
SAVED ME FROM
A LOT OF THE SAME DEMONS
THAT HAVE A HOLD ON YOU.

15:00.032 --> 15:02.534
TRUST ME,
WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE,

15:02.534 --> 15:04.536
I WAS JUST AS
CONFUSED AS YOU ARE.

15:05.054 --> 15:07.256
MAYBE EVEN MORE SO.

15:07.256 --> 15:09.675
ALL I WANTED TO
DO WAS LIVE MY LIFE.

15:09.675 --> 15:13.028
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
THESE GUYS COME AFTER
YOU FOR NO GOOD REASON.

15:13.028 --> 15:15.264
WELL,
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT
I CAN WORK PEOPLE OVER

15:15.264 --> 15:17.666
EMOTIONALLY WITH MY MIND.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.085
WELL, YES, THERE
IS THAT ONE THING.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.756
WE'VE ALL HAD OUR
GIFTS SINCE BIRTH.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.092
AND JUST LIKE WE
LEARNED TO WALK AND TALK,

15:27.092 --> 15:29.595
WE'VE HAD TO DEVELOP SKILLS WITH
OUR NEW MUTANT ABILITIES TOO.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.764
OKAY.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.733
ADAM ASKED ME TO TEACH YOU
SOME FOCUSSING TECHNIQUES.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.852
HELP YOU CHANNEL YOUR ABILITIES.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.855
ADAM ASKED
YOU TO DO THAT?

15:39.855 --> 15:41.991
HE'S GOT A LOT
OF FAITH IN YOU.

15:41.991 --> 15:44.460
IT'S UP TO YOU
TO JUSTIFY THAT FAITH.

15:49.665 --> 15:52.001
I JUST WANT
YOU TO FOLLOW MY LEAD.

15:52.001 --> 15:54.136
AND DON'T WORRY IF
YOU CAN'T GET IT RIGHT AWAY.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.005
IT'S PROGRESS WE'RE AFTER.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.507
NOT PERFECTION.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.021
GOSH, YOU'RE SUCH
A HOTSHOT TELEPATH,

17:20.638 --> 17:22.523
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAW THAT COMING.

17:22.523 --> 17:25.027
THAT IS THE END OF THE
PAIN PORTION OF OUR PROGRAM,

17:25.027 --> 17:26.895
ASSUMING YOU
DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD.

17:37.956 --> 17:41.076
GET THE HELL OUT OF THE CHAIR.

17:44.213 --> 17:45.464
WE SEARCHED YOUR STORE
AND WE FOUND A HIDE OUT

17:46.081 --> 17:47.933
BEHIND A SECRET PANEL.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.818
SO NOW ALL WE'D LIKE YOU TO
DO IS INVITE ALL YOUR FREAKY

17:49.818 --> 17:52.087
FRIENDS TO A
LITTLE GET-TOGETHER.

17:54.289 --> 17:56.708
THERE'S ANOTHER SAFE HOUSE.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.924
CAN'T MOVE AGAINST
ECKHART UNTIL WE'RE READY.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.927
BUT FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN
OF EMMA, WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.429
AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR
FRUSTRATION, BUT TAKING ACTION

18:17.429 --> 18:19.932
PREMATURELY COULD
GET US ALL KILLED.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.941
THANKS, ADAM.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.943
FOR WHAT?

18:30.943 --> 18:33.445
FOR LISTENING TO ME WHEN
I SAID I THOUGHT EMMA

18:33.946 --> 18:36.448
DESERVED A SECOND CHANCE.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.718
IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE IN SECOND
CHANCES, YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.

18:39.718 --> 18:41.854
START SCAN.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.358
WAS I REALLY THAT DIFFICULT?

18:46.358 --> 18:48.861
WELL, WHEN I FOUND YOU YOU WERE
HOLED IN SOME FLEABAG HOTEL.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.363
HADN'T EATEN IN FIVE DAYS.

18:51.363 --> 18:53.866
I WAS CONVINCED I WAS SOME
KIND OF FREAK, WITH WHAT WAS

18:53.866 --> 18:56.502
HAPPENING WITH
MY BODY AND MY MIND.

18:56.502 --> 18:58.604
END SCAN.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.512
WELL, I'D SAY YOU PULLED
YOURSELF TOGETHER PRETTY WELL,

19:07.012 --> 19:08.514
EVERYTHING CONSIDERED.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.015
WELL,
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU.

19:10.015 --> 19:12.284
THE GOOD AND THE BAD.

19:12.284 --> 19:16.939
YOU DON'T NEED TO
GO THERE WITH ME, ADAM.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.580
SO, HOW AM I DOING?

19:25.080 --> 19:27.082
VISUAL DIAGNOSTIC.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.604
PERFECT.

19:35.807 --> 19:38.810
THESE ID'S ARE
IRONCLAD WITH AN ELECTRONIC
PAPER TRAIL THAT'S FOOLPROOF.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.564
THERE YOU GO, ALLISON.

19:42.564 --> 19:43.815
THANK YOU.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.684
WHERE'S RUBY?

19:57.679 --> 19:59.531
GET EVERYONE OUT OF HERE.

20:04.987 --> 20:06.788
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

21:08.250 --> 21:08.867
ROUND THEM UP.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.068
LET'S GO.

21:10.068 --> 21:11.320
YES, MR THORNE.

21:16.291 --> 21:18.860
ALRIGHT, MULWRAY,
YOUR POWERS ARE BACK ON.

21:18.860 --> 21:19.895
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.768
OR DO YOU REQUIRE A LITTLE
JOLT FOR MOTIVATION?

22:12.514 --> 22:18.687
NICE WORK, MULWRAY.

22:18.687 --> 22:21.106
HEY, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

22:21.106 --> 22:23.525
HE WENT GHOST ON ME,
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

22:34.486 --> 22:35.987
HE HAS A PERFECTLY
CLEAR SHOT AT ME,

22:35.987 --> 22:37.989
AND HE HESITATES JUST LONG
ENOUGH FOR ME TO PHASE OUT,

22:37.989 --> 22:39.991
SHOOTS THROUGH ME
AND HITS TWO GS AGENTS.

22:39.991 --> 22:40.992
COULD HAVE
BEEN AN ACCIDENT.

22:41.493 --> 22:42.994
NO WAY.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.616
NO, EMMA'S IS RIGHT.

22:48.116 --> 22:51.553
HE THREW ME A LOOK.

22:51.553 --> 22:54.056
HE KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

22:54.056 --> 22:55.307
GOOD.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.809
THEN ECKHART HASN'T BEEN
ABLE TO SUBORN BRENNAN YET.

22:57.809 --> 23:00.562
HE MADE IT POSSIBLE
FOR ME TO GET OUT OF THERE.

23:00.562 --> 23:02.848
BUT THEY GOT EVERYBODY ELSE.

23:02.848 --> 23:05.233
OH, EXCEPT FOR RUBY.

23:05.233 --> 23:06.418
HE WASN'T THERE.

23:06.418 --> 23:07.669
HAS HE CHECKED IN?

23:07.669 --> 23:10.172
NO, I HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO FIND HIM YET.

23:10.172 --> 23:14.376
WELL, WE HAVE FAILED THE
PEOPLE WE PLEDGED TO PROTECT.

23:14.376 --> 23:16.378
WELL, I SAY LET'S GET IN
THERE AND GET THEM THE HELL OUT.

23:16.878 --> 23:18.397
FINE, GET IN WHERE?

23:18.397 --> 23:19.898
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE
ECKHART'S HOLDING THEM.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.050
LET ME FIND THEM.

23:22.050 --> 23:24.169
I CAN DO IT.

23:24.169 --> 23:26.037
I HAVE THE POWER.

23:26.037 --> 23:32.294
ARE YOU WILLING
TO WORK WITH ME TO GET
YOUR GIFTS UNDER CONTROL?

23:32.294 --> 23:36.982
I AM.

23:36.982 --> 23:40.769
THEN IT'S
TIME TO TAKE YOUR FIRST
STEP INTO A WHOLE NEW LIFE.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.451
NICELY DONE, MR THORNE.

23:56.451 --> 23:59.004
I UNDERSTAND
THERE WERE PROBLEMS.

24:00.222 --> 24:02.057
MR MULWRAY TOOK
AIM AT ONE OF ADAM'S MEN,

24:02.674 --> 24:06.978
THE MAN WENT INTANGIBLE,
MR MULWRAY SHOT THROUGH HIM,

24:06.978 --> 24:10.398
WHICH IN TURN ALLOWED
THE MAN TO ESCAPE.

24:33.321 --> 24:35.690
BRING ME THE DELAURO GIRL.

24:35.690 --> 24:37.576
AND NO EXCUSES.

24:43.648 --> 24:46.151
ENGAGE THERMAL CLOAK.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.155
ANALYSIS OF YOUR DNA SUGGESTS
THAT YOU'VE GOT AN ENORMOUS

24:50.672 --> 24:52.807
RESERVOIR OF UNTAPPED POWER.

24:53.308 --> 24:55.911
AND A SENSITIVITY THAT WILL
ALLOW YOU TO TELE-EMPATHICALLY

24:55.911 --> 24:58.914
CONTACT ALLISON,
VINCE AND THE OTHERS.

24:58.914 --> 25:04.002
BUT... YOU HAVE TO FOCUS.

25:04.002 --> 25:06.821
YOU CAN DO IT, EMMA.

25:06.821 --> 25:09.107
JUST LIKE I TAUGHT YOU.

25:23.555 --> 25:25.140
OH, GOD.

25:27.993 --> 25:29.044
WHAT?

25:29.044 --> 25:30.929
I CAN SEE THEM.

25:30.929 --> 25:33.181
I SEE ALLISON.

25:33.181 --> 25:35.417
AND VINCE.

25:35.417 --> 25:36.518
GOOD.

25:36.518 --> 25:38.537
WHERE ARE THEY?

25:48.930 --> 25:51.299
I DON'T KNOW.

25:59.674 --> 26:02.177
WELCOME, ALL OF YOU.

26:02.177 --> 26:05.797
THE CHILDREN OF GENOMEX
HAVE BEEN AWAY TOO LONG.

26:05.797 --> 26:09.884
MY NAME IS MASON ECKHART.

26:09.884 --> 26:13.638
IT'S TIME WE ALL GOT
TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER.

26:24.215 --> 26:26.051
I CAN'T DO IT, ADAM.

26:26.051 --> 26:28.503
I'M SORRY.

26:28.503 --> 26:33.908
EMMA,
YOU'RE NEW AT THIS.

26:34.459 --> 26:36.645
IT'S OKAY.

26:36.645 --> 26:40.715
WHEN YOU WERE FIVE, YOU
FOUND YOUR PARENTS, RIGHT?

26:40.715 --> 26:43.385
YEAH,
BUT I KNEW MY PARENTS.

26:43.985 --> 26:45.537
AND YOU KNOW BRENNAN.

26:49.324 --> 26:51.343
YOU CAN DO IT.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.945
ONE MORE TIME.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.564
FOR HIM.

26:59.718 --> 27:01.786
FOCUS.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.307
BRENNAN.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.942
I SEE HIM.

27:39.257 --> 27:41.760
I KNOW WHERE HE IS.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.282
SATELLITE HAS A PLACE
BETWEEN THE TWO SAFE HOUSES.

27:47.782 --> 27:49.784
SHE'S LOOKING FOR HER
FREAKY LITTLE FRIENDS.

27:49.784 --> 27:51.786
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL TO
BETRAY YOUR OWN KIND, HUH?

27:51.786 --> 27:53.405
FREAKS LIKE US.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.824
WELL, I THINK YOU
SHOULD SPEAK FOR YOURSELF
BECAUSE I'M NO FREAK.

27:55.824 --> 27:59.861
SEE, I JUST
GOT A TALENT AND I'M USING
IT THE BEST WAY I KNOW HOW.

27:59.861 --> 28:03.448
YEAH,
LIKE YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

28:03.948 --> 28:05.800
YEAH.

28:05.800 --> 28:09.954
BECAUSE YOU SEE, I VOLUNTEERED.

28:10.455 --> 28:12.457
YOU MUST BE REAL PROUD.

28:23.084 --> 28:25.370
WELL.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.522
HI.

29:27.615 --> 29:31.786
LOVELY TO FINALLY MEET YOU
FACE TO FACE, MS DE LAURO

29:32.287 --> 29:34.289
YOU'RE ECKHART?

29:34.789 --> 29:37.325
MR ECKHART.

29:37.325 --> 29:40.345
YOU'LL LEARN SOON ENOUGH HOW
TO BEST DEAL WITH AUTHORITY.

29:40.345 --> 29:43.264
YOU'LL BE GIVEN
AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT
YOUR ABILITIES TO USE

29:43.765 --> 29:46.267
RESCUING OTHERS
LIKE YOURSELF.

29:46.267 --> 29:48.119
YOU CALL DRAGGING
US HERE RESCUE?

29:48.119 --> 29:51.339
I CALL IT
PROTECTIVE CUSTODY.

29:51.339 --> 29:54.392
WHO IT'S INTENDED
TO PROTECT IS OPEN
TO INTERPRETATION.

29:54.392 --> 29:56.194
AS FOR YOU, MR MULWRAY,
I HAVE TO SAY I'M TERRIBLY

29:56.828 --> 29:59.330
DISAPPOINTED BY MR THORNE'S
REPORT ON YOUR BEHAVIOUR.

29:59.330 --> 30:03.017
I'VE BEEN HEARING THAT
SINCE THE THIRD GRADE.

30:03.017 --> 30:05.353
IT'S REALLY TOO BAD.

30:05.353 --> 30:07.605
YOU COULD
HAVE BEEN OF ENORMOUS
SERVICE TO THE CAUSE.

30:07.605 --> 30:12.644
INSTEAD, YOU'LL BE PUT INTO
STASIS FOR FUTURE EXAMINATION.

30:35.483 --> 30:38.319
THE ALARM
REBOOTS IN FIVE MINUTES,
SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

30:47.278 --> 30:49.464
HAVE TO FIND WHERE THEY'RE
HOLDING EMMA AND THE OTHERS.

30:49.464 --> 30:51.633
I HAVE TO GET
INTO THAT CONTROL ROOM.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.135
HOLD ON, ADAM.

30:54.135 --> 30:56.004
THIS IS WOMAN'S WORK.

31:03.278 --> 31:06.965
EXCUSE ME, COULD YOU TELL
ME WHERE YOU'VE GOT THE NEW

31:06.965 --> 31:08.766
MUTANTS LOCKED UP?

31:33.157 --> 31:34.409
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN HIM

31:34.959 --> 31:35.960
I DON'T DOUBT IT.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.822
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO
CHECK OUT, OKAY WITH YOU?

32:20.822 --> 32:21.956
YEAH.

32:39.474 --> 32:42.977
ADAM HAS DISENGAGED ALL OF
YOUR SUB-DERMAL GOVERNORS.

32:42.977 --> 32:49.083
SO IT'S TIME FOR
YOU GUYS TO HIT THE ROAD.

32:49.083 --> 32:52.086
HERE'S YOUR NEW ID'S.

32:52.086 --> 32:54.088
TOOK YOU LONG
ENOUGH TO TRACK ME HERE.

32:54.088 --> 32:56.240
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE
LET ME IN ON THE GAG.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.259
WELL, I HAD TO FIGURE
THE WALLS HAVE EARS.

32:58.259 --> 33:00.461
THANKS FOR THE HEADS
UP AT THE SAFE HOUSE.

33:00.461 --> 33:02.463
WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

33:02.463 --> 33:04.966
JUST LUCKY I MISSED.

33:42.954 --> 33:44.205
SHALIMAR?

33:44.205 --> 33:45.823
GUESS AGAIN, ADAM.

33:46.324 --> 33:49.210
NEVER DID KNOW
WHEN TO STOP, DID YOU?

33:49.210 --> 33:52.413
YOU KNOW, WE'RE BOTH GUILTY
OF RELENTLESS TENACITY, MASON.

33:52.413 --> 33:54.749
IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE
ALWAYS HAD IN COMMON.

33:54.749 --> 33:56.517
TRUE.

33:56.517 --> 33:59.487
BUT WHILE
YOU CHASE YOUR HORRIFIC
DREAMS OF RESCUING THESE

33:59.487 --> 34:04.375
LABORATORY MISTAKES, MY PASSION
IS IN THE SERVICE OF HUMANITY.

34:04.375 --> 34:07.361
A GRIM AND LIMITED VISION OF
HUMANITY DEFINED BY YOUR NARROW

34:07.361 --> 34:09.864
MIND AND YOUR
PATHETIC PERSPECTIVE.

34:33.371 --> 34:36.190
I SUSPECT THAT
YOU'VE DONE THAT BEFORE.

34:38.693 --> 34:40.328
HEY.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.864
GOT SOME UNFINISHED
BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.

34:44.899 --> 34:48.018
YOU AND YOUR
FREAKS ARE THREATS TO
EVERYTHING I HOLD DEAR.

34:48.018 --> 34:51.621
THESE SO-CALLED
FREAKS ARE THE PRODUCT
OF GENOMEX'S RECKLESSNESS.

34:52.123 --> 34:53.925
WHAT, AM I SUPPOSED
TO BE WRACKED BY GUILT?

34:53.925 --> 34:55.576
NO, I'D NEVER EXPECT
GUILT FROM YOU, MASON.

34:55.576 --> 34:57.728
IT'S TOO MUCH
TO ASK OF A SOCIOPATH.

34:57.728 --> 34:59.564
NO, THAT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS
ADMIRED ABOUT YOU, ADAM.

34:59.564 --> 35:01.449
YOUR UTTERLY PERVERSE
SENSE OF REALITY.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.971
THORNE.

35:48.796 --> 35:50.798
IF I'D KNOWN IT WAS
THIS EASY TO GET YOU HERE,

35:50.798 --> 35:52.350
I'D HAVE INVITED YOU SOONER.

35:52.350 --> 35:53.501
I'LL BE BACK.

35:53.501 --> 35:55.386
WELL,
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

35:55.386 --> 35:57.889
THEN YOU CAN VISIT THAT CAGE
OF FREAKS I'VE GOT UPSTAIRS.

35:57.889 --> 36:01.125
THANKS TO MUTANT X, THEY SHOULD
ALL BE ONE THEIR WAY OUT BY NOW.

36:01.125 --> 36:04.228
I'VE DISENGAGED
ALL YOUR GOVERNORS,
AND OUR LITTLE TALK HAS

36:04.228 --> 36:07.064
GONE ON JUST LONG ENOUGH FOR
THE VIRUS THAT I UPLOADED INTO

36:07.064 --> 36:09.383
YOUR DATABASE TO DO ITS WORK.

36:30.171 --> 36:32.190
I EXPECT BETTER THAN A
CHEAP BLUFF FROM YOU, ADAM.

37:54.805 --> 37:56.674
WELL,
I GUESS IT IS TRUE.

37:56.674 --> 37:57.825
WHAT'S THAT?

37:58.442 --> 38:00.328
THE BIGGER THEY ARE,
THE FASTER THEY RUN.

38:00.328 --> 38:03.414
THAT'S BECAUSE
HE KNOWS I CAN LIGHT HIM
UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE.

38:03.414 --> 38:08.336
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE JOIN THE
OTHERS AND GET OUT OF HERE?

38:40.384 --> 38:41.635
NICE PLACE.

38:41.635 --> 38:43.254
HUH?

38:43.254 --> 38:44.839
THIS MUST BE REAL FUN TO CLEAN.

38:44.839 --> 38:46.707
GET THE FEELING HE'S
ALWAYS LIKE THIS, HUH?

38:46.707 --> 38:48.592
ALWAYS.

38:50.411 --> 38:53.381
WELCOME.

38:53.381 --> 38:59.186
EMMA, WHEN I
STARTED THIS JOURNEY,

38:59.186 --> 39:03.257
I ALWAYS KNEW I
NEEDED SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

39:03.257 --> 39:07.361
SOMEONE WITH
THE GIFT OF INNER VISION,
AND THE STRENGTH OF

39:07.361 --> 39:11.582
CHARACTER TO BEAR THE WEIGHT
OF SO POWERFUL A GIFT.

39:11.582 --> 39:15.770
NOW, IN TIME, YOU'LL COME TO
SEE YOURSELF AS I SEE YOU.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.538
BUT FOR NOW, YOU'LL JUST
HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT;

39:18.039 --> 39:20.608
YOU'RE AN ANSWERED PRAYER.

39:23.811 --> 39:27.732
AND BRENNAN,
I NEVER WANTED TO WORK
WITH SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

39:28.282 --> 39:32.053
SOMEONE THAT WOULD
SQUANDER HIS INCREDIBLE
GIFT ON PETTY CRIME.

39:32.053 --> 39:34.638
AN OUTLAW'S
LIVE-FOR-THE-MOMENT MENTALITY.

39:34.638 --> 39:38.492
UNTIL I REALISED
THAT I HAVE CHOSEN THE PATH

39:38.492 --> 39:40.227
OF THE OUTLAW FOR MYSELF.

39:40.795 --> 39:46.350
AND WHO BETTER
THAN A FELLOW OUTLAW
TO HELP SHOW ME THE WAY?

39:46.350 --> 39:49.870
YOU'VE BOTH SEEN
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST,

39:49.870 --> 39:54.458
AND THAT THE
ODDS ARE AGAINST US.

39:54.458 --> 39:58.229
BUT EMMA, I'M HOPING THAT THIS
IS A CHANCE FOR YOU TO FULFIL

39:58.229 --> 40:00.748
THE POTENTIAL THAT YOU KNOW
IS INSIDE YOU AND YOU'VE NEVER

40:00.748 --> 40:03.751
BEEN ABLE TO QUITE REACH.

40:03.751 --> 40:06.904
AND BRENNAN, FOR YOU IT'S AN
OPPORTUNITY TO PUT THE PAST

40:06.904 --> 40:13.527
BEHIND YOU
AND TO JOIN WITH US ALL IN
HELPING CREATE A NEW FUTURE.

40:30.978 --> 40:32.696
THANK YOU.

40:52.616 --> 40:54.785
WHAT, NO HUG?

41:06.931 --> 41:08.766
ALL RIGHT, I'M IN.

41:08.766 --> 41:13.103
BUT AS LONG AS THERE'S NO HAZING
OR WEIRD SECRET HANDSHAKES.

41:13.103 --> 41:14.989
NO HAZING.

41:15.556 --> 41:17.324
NO HANDSHAKES.

41:17.324 --> 41:19.710
BUT YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO
DO SOME BASIC HOUSEKEEPING.

41:28.385 --> 41:31.572
YES,
THE RING IS YOUR KEY TO YOUR
OWN PERSONAL DNA STRAND.

41:32.072 --> 41:33.691
YOURS AND YOURS ALONE.

41:40.264 --> 41:42.600
WELCOME TO MUTANT X.

41:43.234 --> 41:47.454
GOD HELP ANYONE WHO TRIES
TO STAND IN OUR WAY.
