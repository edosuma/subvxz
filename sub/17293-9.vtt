00:05.380 --> 00:07.042

DORIAN: <i>The Maxwell heirloom</i>

00:10.684 --> 00:11.605
<i>and the tuning fork.</i>

00:11.607 --> 00:12.808
Those things fit together

00:12.810 --> 00:13.832
to make the hammer

00:13.834 --> 00:15.107
that swings inside a bell.

00:15.108 --> 00:16.408
When properly assembled,

00:16.410 --> 00:19.311
this bell becomes like
a mystical super bell.

00:19.313 --> 00:21.168
They ring the charter bell every year.

00:21.170 --> 00:22.669
No, your mom had it in storage.

All those boxes you
brought over to the house,

00:24.023 --> 00:26.192
- they're still in the garage.
- Take me there.

00:39.445 --> 00:40.925
I don't.

00:42.169 --> 00:43.702
SYBIL: You seem so rational

00:43.704 --> 00:45.971
when it comes to your daughter's safety.

<i>I just hope that the

03:48.701 --> 03:51.469
- Mm.
- Yeah.

03:51.471 --> 03:53.170

Enzo's.

(as Enzo): "A mere symbol of
an eternity with you, love."

That seems like one
very specific symbol.

04:21.567 --> 04:23.000
(phone ringing)

04:23.573 --> 04:26.374
Why would psycho siren-nanny call you?

04:26.399 --> 04:28.906
Apparently she and her
sister are fighting.

04:28.908 --> 04:30.708
And we care because...?

04:30.710 --> 04:33.144
- (phone beeps)
- What do you want?

04:33.146 --> 04:35.562
My sister's on the warpath.

04:35.587 --> 04:37.615
The artifact that
she's trying to assemble

04:37.617 --> 04:39.961
has the power to kill her.

04:39.986 --> 04:42.586
That's why she's after all
three pieces of the bell.

04:42.588 --> 04:43.788
Lucky for you,

04:43.790 --> 04:46.057
I already stole the biggest part.

04:46.730 --> 04:49.093
Did you want a congrats in person?

04:49.095 --> 04:50.728
I mean, we're due at an event.

04:50.730 --> 04:52.563
You have something I need.

04:52.565 --> 04:54.098
I have something you need.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.199
I have the bell.

04:55.201 --> 04:56.643
You have the tuning fork.

04:56.668 --> 04:59.202
And together, we're like
chocolate and peanut butter.

04:59.227 --> 05:01.939
Or peanut butter and garbage.

05:01.941 --> 05:04.191
SELINE: Hey, I am trying to make amends.

05:04.216 --> 05:06.883
I could've just as easily called Damon.

05:06.908 --> 05:10.481
He has the third piece
of the bell, the striker.

05:10.483 --> 05:11.882
What's ths striker?

05:11.884 --> 05:13.718
It's an iron ball.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.619
My sister had him fetch
it from the Maxwells.

05:15.621 --> 05:17.308
He doesn't even know what it is.

05:17.333 --> 05:19.801
Look, I am partially responsible

05:19.826 --> 05:21.525
for the damage she
inflicts on the world.

05:21.527 --> 05:23.227
If I want to make good,

05:23.229 --> 05:26.263
that starts with killing Sybil.

05:26.265 --> 05:29.300
I'm just having a hard
time taking you seriously

05:29.302 --> 05:31.769
because of everything you've done.

05:31.771 --> 05:33.504
You don't have to trust me.

05:33.506 --> 05:35.906
But I sure as hell am trusting you.

05:35.908 --> 05:38.809
With a weapon of terrible power.

05:40.004 --> 05:42.113
(chuckles) Well,

05:42.115 --> 05:44.815
I love a weapon of terrible power.

05:44.817 --> 05:47.184
Where are you going?

05:47.186 --> 05:49.286
Miss Mystic Falls.

05:49.288 --> 05:51.155
Those of us who haven't
burnt every single bridge

05:51.157 --> 05:53.791
we've ever crossed have obligations.

06:01.901 --> 06:04.301
(classical music plays)

06:07.974 --> 06:10.241
(phone ringing)

06:10.834 --> 06:13.401
Hey, Care. I'm here with Dorian.

06:13.426 --> 06:15.413
Tell me you still have the tuning fork.

06:15.415 --> 06:19.183
- Uh, it's called "the Staff of Arcadius."
- That's "yes" in Nerdish.

06:19.185 --> 06:20.151
Bonnie and I are stuck

06:20.153 --> 06:22.353
at Miss Mystic Falls, but Seline

06:22.355 --> 06:24.622
just tried to call a truce with
us to put together the bell.

06:24.624 --> 06:26.624
- I don't like the sound of that.
- Me neither.

06:26.626 --> 06:27.906
But if she's still in town,

06:27.931 --> 06:29.827
it means she must've
hidden the bell close by.

06:29.829 --> 06:30.895
Can you get a lead?

06:30.897 --> 06:32.062
Yeah, we're on it.

06:32.064 --> 06:33.125
(phone beeps)

06:33.150 --> 06:34.950
All right, we're-we're on it, uh...

06:34.975 --> 06:37.568
- no, like, plan, or...?
- I have a plan.

06:37.570 --> 06:39.270
Can't wait to hear some details.

06:39.272 --> 06:41.572
Here's the only thing
you need to focus on:

06:41.574 --> 06:43.340
payback.

06:43.342 --> 06:44.742
Mm.

06:47.847 --> 06:49.346
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:49.348 --> 06:51.615
Okay, those are the last
names on the guest list.

06:51.617 --> 06:53.350
Perfect. Once the dance is underway,

06:53.352 --> 06:55.886
we can get out of here
and find that striker.

06:55.888 --> 06:57.188
Hopefully Damon decides

06:57.190 --> 06:59.924
to answer his phone.

06:59.926 --> 07:02.124
Or we could ask him in person.

07:11.037 --> 07:13.571
What are you even doing here?

07:13.573 --> 07:15.406
SYBIL: I invited them.

07:16.251 --> 07:17.951
Don't worry.

07:17.976 --> 07:20.676

I'll make sure they behave.

07:30.635 --> 07:32.432
CAROLINE: It should
look effortless, ladies.

07:32.457 --> 07:33.823
And don't forget to smile.

07:33.848 --> 07:36.194
But not because society
says you have to,

07:36.196 --> 07:37.495
but because you're happy to be

07:37.497 --> 07:39.563
at such an illustrious town event.

07:39.588 --> 07:41.443
You guys look great.

07:41.468 --> 07:44.836

09:18.639 --> 09:20.373
to relive your glory days.

09:27.647 --> 09:29.817
You're right.

09:29.819 --> 09:33.521
I have no idea why
that was such a dilemma.

09:51.441 --> 09:53.156
Told you to wait for back-up.

09:54.076 --> 09:55.276
Thanks for coming.

09:55.278 --> 09:57.959
Sybil just sirened that girl. I know it.

09:57.984 --> 09:59.959
All the more reason to
proceed with caution.

09:59.984 --> 10:02.049
Leave the fisticuffs to the immortals.

10:02.051 --> 10:05.619
We've been together almost three years

10:05.621 --> 10:07.279
and never once have you played

10:07.304 --> 10:08.732
the immortal card on me.

10:08.757 --> 10:11.358
Is it maybe because you gave
me a vial of literal immortality

10:11.383 --> 10:13.574
to wear around my neck at all times?

10:13.599 --> 10:14.843
Was that maybe more than...

10:14.845 --> 10:16.678
just a symbol?

10:16.680 --> 10:18.313
No, it's like I said,

10:18.315 --> 10:21.483
that is merely a token of
my eternal love for you.

10:21.485 --> 10:22.718
Okay.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.821
Your exact words were,

10:25.823 --> 10:27.823
"I can't imagine life without you."

10:27.825 --> 10:29.958
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.142
And I can't imagine
losing you either, but...

10:32.167 --> 10:33.929
But?

10:33.931 --> 10:36.631
I cannot become a vampire, Enzo.

10:36.633 --> 10:38.784
My life is still linked to Elena's.

10:38.809 --> 10:39.941
When Kai put her to sleep,

10:39.966 --> 10:42.867
he said no loopholes, no witchy-woo.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.659
Fact is, we don't know what
would happen if I turned.

10:45.684 --> 10:47.918
Can't do it.

10:47.943 --> 10:49.823
Even if I wanted to.

10:54.384 --> 10:56.718
(footfalls receding)

10:56.720 --> 10:58.487
(sighs)

11:02.143 --> 11:03.976
(sighs)

11:07.664 --> 11:09.297
(ringing)

11:09.299 --> 11:10.336
(yells)

11:10.361 --> 11:12.367
DORIAN: Don't move. Don't speak.

11:12.369 --> 11:14.770
(scoffs) The least you
could do is tell me why

11:14.772 --> 11:16.772
you're ruining my day-drinking.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.274
(groans)

11:20.210 --> 11:21.576
Georgie.

11:21.578 --> 11:22.677
Georgie is why.

11:22.679 --> 11:23.879
Who?

11:24.715 --> 11:26.114
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, no.

11:26.116 --> 11:29.384
Georgie, Georgie. I
know, I know. I get it.

11:29.386 --> 11:30.585
I killed your friend.

11:30.587 --> 11:31.720
Okay.

11:31.722 --> 11:34.556
Then you know why I'm here.

11:34.558 --> 11:35.991
Payback's a bitch.

11:35.993 --> 11:38.093
(groans)

11:38.095 --> 11:40.418
CAROLINE (clapping):
Finishing touches, ladies.

11:40.443 --> 11:42.841
This year, the judges
really value efficiency,

11:42.866 --> 11:46.434
so keep it short and
sweet and we can all...

11:46.436 --> 11:49.204
get out of here. (chuckles)

11:50.783 --> 11:53.617
Damon, why are you upstairs?

11:53.642 --> 11:55.508
That's a good question.

11:55.533 --> 11:58.501
Sybil called me back here.

11:58.526 --> 12:02.027
She wants that ball of iron
I've been lugging around.

12:02.052 --> 12:05.120
For the first time, I was
actually able to tell her no.

12:05.832 --> 12:07.732
Because of this.

12:07.734 --> 12:09.663
If you haven't given her
that bell striker yet,

12:09.688 --> 12:10.635
I need it.

12:10.637 --> 12:12.870
It's part of a weapon
that can kill sirens.

12:12.872 --> 12:14.672
Absolutely not.

12:14.674 --> 12:17.212
I don't want Sybil dead until
she fixes what's going on

12:17.237 --> 12:18.209
inside of my head!

12:18.211 --> 12:20.978
I don't know what's happening to me,

12:20.980 --> 12:24.615
but so far, this <i>thing</i> has
been nothing but trouble.

12:24.617 --> 12:26.284
Why did you give me this?

12:26.286 --> 12:27.385
It was Elena's.

12:27.387 --> 12:28.653
Yeah, I know that.

12:28.655 --> 12:30.955
Why does it mean anything to me?

12:30.957 --> 12:34.992
I hold it and I get this...

12:34.994 --> 12:37.295
little flicker of warmth.

12:37.297 --> 12:38.963
And then... (blows) it's gone.

12:38.965 --> 12:41.666
What did that woman do to you?

12:41.668 --> 12:43.634
After I flipped my switch,

12:43.636 --> 12:47.605
Sybil tinkered in my head.

12:47.607 --> 12:48.687
I don't know what it was,

12:48.712 --> 12:50.609
but she did something to guarantee

12:50.634 --> 12:53.368
that all my feelings
for Elena went away.

12:53.393 --> 12:56.909
Damon, I gave you that necklace
because it is as powerful

12:56.934 --> 12:59.751
and as magical as the love
that you and Elena have

12:59.753 --> 13:02.320
for each other. Being here

13:02.322 --> 13:04.388
and feeling what you're feeling proves

13:04.390 --> 13:06.991
that a love that deep and real

13:06.993 --> 13:09.293
can win over anything.

13:09.295 --> 13:11.662
And of course you want to believe that.

13:11.664 --> 13:14.732
Because if you didn't, you'd
be forced to admit to yourself

13:14.734 --> 13:16.734
that you and Stefan are through.

13:16.736 --> 13:18.069
(scoffs)

13:18.071 --> 13:19.670
What are you talking about?

13:19.672 --> 13:21.873
He is ripping again, Caroline.

13:21.875 --> 13:23.975
And this time, it's guilt-free.

13:23.977 --> 13:27.645
The fact that you're telling
me this proves you care.

13:27.647 --> 13:28.746
Somewhere deep down

13:28.748 --> 13:31.382
in that part of you where
Elena is still buried.

13:33.219 --> 13:34.685
Find that place, Damon.

13:34.687 --> 13:36.220
Fight for her.

13:36.222 --> 13:39.357
Or spend the rest of
eternity trying to figure out

13:39.359 --> 13:41.259
what happened to the best part of you.

13:41.261 --> 13:43.227
It's your choice.

13:52.572 --> 13:54.705
Are you Stefan Salvatore?

13:54.707 --> 13:56.574
(swallows)

13:56.576 --> 13:58.709
So what if I am?

13:58.711 --> 14:01.412
I have something for you.

14:05.251 --> 14:06.818
(chuckles softly)

14:08.621 --> 14:10.188
Who do I have to thank?

14:10.190 --> 14:12.757
SYBIL: Your friendly neighborhood siren.

14:14.958 --> 14:16.627
(Stefan sighs)

14:16.629 --> 14:18.129
I can find my own meals,
thank you very much.

14:18.131 --> 14:19.163
Clearly,

14:19.165 --> 14:20.898
given the stench of blood on you.

14:20.900 --> 14:23.167
Aren't you supposed to be
turning angels into devils

14:23.169 --> 14:24.735
in the name of Cade?

14:24.737 --> 14:27.605
Yes, which is why it's
such a pain in the ass

14:27.607 --> 14:29.907
when you yank on my
brother's supernatural leash.

14:29.909 --> 14:32.944
Actually, it seems that
dog has slipped its collar.

14:32.946 --> 14:35.680
Your brother's been
resisting my influence.

14:35.682 --> 14:37.281
I don't know how,

14:37.283 --> 14:38.683
but if Damon's faltering on the job,

14:38.685 --> 14:40.017
don't blame me, blame...

14:40.019 --> 14:41.052
Elena.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.787
He's able to resist you

14:42.789 --> 14:44.021
because of this place.

14:44.023 --> 14:45.356
Miss Mystic Falls.

14:45.358 --> 14:46.958
You made a mistake

14:46.960 --> 14:48.593
by bringing him here.

14:48.595 --> 14:50.595
This stupid pageant is
the day that Damon realized

14:50.597 --> 14:51.996
that he could take Elena from me.

14:51.998 --> 14:54.131
In his mind, this place,

14:54.133 --> 14:55.800
this event,

14:55.802 --> 14:58.803
was the beginning of their
vomit-inducing love story.

14:58.805 --> 15:00.204
(scoffs)

15:00.206 --> 15:02.340
I thought I'd erased
her influence over him

15:02.342 --> 15:03.875
from start to finish.

15:03.877 --> 15:06.944
Take it from me, Elena
Gilbert never really goes away.

15:06.946 --> 15:09.113
So how do we win him back?

15:10.984 --> 15:12.650
Well,

15:12.675 --> 15:15.212
we remind Damon

15:15.214 --> 15:19.390
of what really happened
at Miss Mystic Falls.

15:25.947 --> 15:28.281
(phone chimes)

15:29.633 --> 15:32.368
_

15:35.507 --> 15:37.540
(phone keys clicking)

15:39.671 --> 15:41.897
_

15:43.440 --> 15:45.507
- (forceful knocking)
- Police!

15:45.532 --> 15:47.298
Open up!

15:50.964 --> 15:52.430
I wasn't breaking and entering.

15:52.455 --> 15:53.904
I was checking on a friend's house.

15:53.929 --> 15:55.729
This whole thing is a
big misunderstanding.

15:55.754 --> 15:57.543
A big enough misunderstanding

15:57.545 --> 16:00.246
that Grove Hill PD felt
the need to call me out here

16:00.248 --> 16:01.748
when they realized who you were.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.455
You understand that, don't you, Sheriff?

16:04.085 --> 16:06.152
Let me get those cuffs off of you.

16:07.622 --> 16:09.088
It's former sheriff,

16:09.090 --> 16:10.957
but yeah, thank you.

16:10.959 --> 16:12.358
What were you looking for, anyway?

16:12.360 --> 16:13.993
This is gonna sound crazy, but, um,

16:13.995 --> 16:15.795
a bell.

16:15.797 --> 16:18.617
Yeah, apparently the town's
been using a fake charter bell

16:18.642 --> 16:22.045
since 1992 and I'm just
trying to find the real one.

16:22.070 --> 16:23.761
What are you doing?

16:23.786 --> 16:25.519
I'm sorry. She told me if anyone asked

16:25.544 --> 16:26.744
about a bell, that I needed...

16:26.769 --> 16:29.183
You're guarding it, aren't you?

16:29.208 --> 16:30.974
Yeah, I'm supposed to stop you.

16:38.008 --> 16:41.832
_

16:45.237 --> 16:49.372
Allow me to introduce this
year's Miss Mystic hopefuls.

16:49.374 --> 16:51.508
Violet Fell,

16:51.510 --> 16:55.178
escorted by Ryan Ashton.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.412
I'm ready to get out of here.

16:56.414 --> 16:57.814
STEFAN: You didn't hand over

16:57.816 --> 16:59.482
that stupid ball Sybil wants...

16:59.484 --> 17:00.617
CAROLINE: Miss Trudy Sulez...

17:00.619 --> 17:01.684
Why do you care?

17:01.686 --> 17:03.186
CAROLINE: ...escorted by Garrett Tanner.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.800
Well, because fighting
Sybil is keeping you

17:05.826 --> 17:07.791
from being the brother that I want.

17:07.794 --> 17:08.895
If this has something to do

17:08.920 --> 17:10.685
with me not pulling my weight with Cade,

17:10.711 --> 17:12.512
I think you're killing
enough for the both of us.

17:12.536 --> 17:14.336
No, that's not what I mean, Damon.

17:14.361 --> 17:15.933
You know,

17:15.935 --> 17:17.868
when we set out on the road together,

17:17.871 --> 17:20.171
I really thought it would
make us brothers again.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.473
But we can't seem to go anywhere

17:22.474 --> 17:24.642
without the past
coming back to haunt us.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.176
What are you talking about?

17:26.179 --> 17:27.377
This place.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.399
The memories.

17:29.424 --> 17:30.982
Dancing with Elena,

17:30.984 --> 17:34.118
ratting me out for
drinking out of blood bags.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.820
It's not my fault you
fell off the wagon.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.656
But you could have helped
me in my time of need.

17:38.658 --> 17:42.026
Instead, you were standing right here,

17:42.028 --> 17:43.394
falling for Elena

17:43.396 --> 17:45.830
as she walked down those stairs.

17:50.637 --> 17:53.404
You think this is where
your love story began,

17:53.406 --> 17:55.840
but the truth is, Damon,

17:55.842 --> 17:57.342
Elena never would have
looked at you twice

17:57.344 --> 17:59.143
if I had been there that day.

17:59.145 --> 18:02.680
That's old news, Stefan.
I don't care about Elena.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.349
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.818
CAROLINE: And Miss Flora Martinez...

18:06.820 --> 18:08.586
STEFAN: Then why...

18:08.588 --> 18:10.121
are you still holding onto this?

18:10.123 --> 18:11.089
Hmm?

18:11.091 --> 18:13.524
You know, when I gave this to Elena,

18:13.526 --> 18:15.620
it was to protect her from you.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.401
(necklace clinks on floor)

18:25.305 --> 18:27.108
Shall we?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.179
Tell me you're not listening to him.

18:35.181 --> 18:36.714
He's not himself.

18:36.716 --> 18:39.450
- Okay?
- I haven't been myself lately, either.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.552
You know, I already lost Stefan.

18:41.554 --> 18:44.222
I'm not losing you to Sybil's sabotage.

18:45.091 --> 18:47.759
What are you doing?

18:47.761 --> 18:49.399
You did this dance.

18:49.424 --> 18:50.595
With Elena.

18:51.252 --> 18:52.562
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.009
It meant something to you.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.968
And this event, this place,

18:56.970 --> 18:58.369
it only means something

18:58.371 --> 19:00.872
to you because of the
feelings you attach to it.

Does this have something to do

with that stupid metal ball?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.841
The striker is the final
piece to the weapon.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.983
I'd be afraid to face her, too,

21:58.985 --> 22:01.552

But what's really gonna
happen is eventually

22:21.046 --> 22:23.541
your humanity is gonna flood back

22:23.543 --> 22:24.775

For kidnapping Ric and
Caroline's children.

22:35.321 --> 22:37.688
For turning Enzo against Bonnie.

22:38.773 --> 22:41.495
For selling your brother's soul to Cade.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.549
And if you're really honest,

22:43.574 --> 22:45.997
for stealing his girl.

22:47.333 --> 22:50.635
You gotta stop that right now.

23:38.469 --> 23:39.868
you're right in the middle.

23:39.870 --> 23:41.236
You're helping us assemble a weapon

23:41.238 --> 23:42.738
that can kill a siren.

23:42.740 --> 23:44.039
You are a siren.

23:44.041 --> 23:46.642
So either you're very trusting,

23:46.644 --> 23:48.911
or you're very manipulative.

23:48.913 --> 23:50.312
What are you hiding?

Fine. I'm working with Matt.

24:07.565 --> 24:11.233
Good. I was hoping
Caroline would rope him in.

24:11.235 --> 24:12.968
- Why?
- Because,

24:12.970 --> 24:14.107
once the bell is assembled,

24:14.132 --> 24:15.904
there's only one family who can ring it.

24:15.929 --> 24:18.463
His.

24:20.878 --> 24:22.578
Damon just took Sybil inside.

24:22.580 --> 24:24.213
If he's giving her that striker...

24:24.215 --> 24:26.348

wrapped up this shindig.

24:26.350 --> 24:28.383

Hey, everyone. Um, so sorry,

24:37.895 --> 24:41.063
but, uh, this year's pageant
will have to be cut short

24:41.065 --> 24:43.999

24:44.001 --> 24:47.770

feel a damn thing for Elena,

25:43.994 --> 25:46.328
the more you try and push her out,

25:46.330 --> 25:51.133

she's never going away.

27:51.286 --> 27:53.555
Oh, yes, she is. She's in your head,

27:53.557 --> 27:57.668
more powerful than Sybil,
manipulating your every move.

I've been dealing

28:06.437 --> 28:08.403
Pretty much. Yeah.

28:08.405 --> 28:10.372
You're choosing her
over your own brother?

28:10.374 --> 28:13.709
No, I'm choosing myself
over everyone else.

28:13.711 --> 28:15.644
I was made for Cade's work.

28:15.646 --> 28:18.981
And, true to form, the
minute I become my best self,

28:18.983 --> 28:20.983
you have to go ahead and ruin it.

28:20.985 --> 28:24.486
Well, I'm not gonna let
you drag me down with you.

28:24.488 --> 28:26.188
Not this time.

28:53.180 --> 28:54.946

28:54.948 --> 28:57.049

You let them go.

29:10.697 --> 29:11.963
Why? You knew all along

29:11.965 --> 29:14.032
I'd have to kill people for Cade.

29:14.034 --> 29:15.744
Evil people and murderers.

29:15.769 --> 29:17.636
These girls are innocent, Stefan.

29:17.638 --> 29:19.104

world is out to crush them.

- Don't worry, she'll be back.
- What do you mean?

29:36.557 --> 29:39.791
Well, I gave each one of
these promising young women

29:39.793 --> 29:41.726
a little taste of my blood.

29:41.728 --> 29:44.162
You're turning them?

29:44.164 --> 29:45.597
You've inspired me, Caroline.

29:45.599 --> 29:47.933
Who would have thought
that a Miss Mystic Falls

29:47.935 --> 29:49.901
would become engaged
to a servant of Cade?

29:49.903 --> 29:52.070
Look in the mirror.

29:52.072 --> 29:56.675
Vampirism is a one-way path to hell.

29:59.179 --> 30:01.546
That's the last of the bystanders.

30:01.548 --> 30:03.315
Come on, let's go back.

30:03.317 --> 30:04.583
No, Bonnie, don't.

30:04.585 --> 30:06.179
- It's too dangerous.
- This again?

30:06.204 --> 30:07.392
Enzo, Caroline needs me.

30:07.417 --> 30:08.987
Caroline can better
protect you if she's not

30:08.989 --> 30:10.655
worried about you in the crossfire.

30:10.657 --> 30:12.891
That's not your decision to make.

30:12.893 --> 30:15.460
What's going on with
you? This isn't you.

30:15.462 --> 30:17.762
You trust me. You listen to me.

30:17.764 --> 30:18.964
Why have you been
watching me like a hawk

30:18.966 --> 30:20.699
since we got back from Paris?

30:20.701 --> 30:24.202
Because it's dangerous in
there, and I can't protect you.

30:24.204 --> 30:26.335
Because you gave me
the damn necklace back,

30:26.360 --> 30:30.262
which was only ever meant
to save you when I can't.

30:31.145 --> 30:32.811
You could die in there.

30:33.780 --> 30:35.680
Look, if something happened to you...

30:35.682 --> 30:37.949
If <i>I</i> had to survive <i>you,</i>

30:37.951 --> 30:41.686
knowing that if I'd just spoken up...

30:41.688 --> 30:43.822
I can't bear the thought.

30:46.226 --> 30:48.126
And I do listen to you.

30:48.128 --> 30:50.295
But I also listen to
the world around you,

30:50.297 --> 30:51.563
and I'm not afraid to speak up

30:51.565 --> 30:54.533
if I fear for your life.

31:02.576 --> 31:05.310
When did you become such a sap?

31:05.312 --> 31:07.078
(chuckles)

31:08.949 --> 31:12.951
I fell in love with a human
who makes me feel alive.

31:27.167 --> 31:31.136
Unlike you, I can control my bloodlust.

31:31.138 --> 31:32.270
Not all vampires are evil.

31:32.272 --> 31:33.572
STEFAN: No.

31:33.574 --> 31:34.773
But we're engaged, Caroline.

31:34.775 --> 31:36.875
That means we're in this together.

31:36.877 --> 31:38.310
You're not just an innocent bystander

31:38.312 --> 31:39.844
if you let me kill for Cade.

31:39.846 --> 31:42.847
So unless you want to
call the whole thing off,

31:42.849 --> 31:45.580
blood is on your hands, too.

31:49.890 --> 31:51.923
(wheezes, grunts)

31:51.925 --> 31:54.125
(laughs)

31:54.127 --> 31:55.460
See?

31:55.462 --> 31:58.396
You're good at this killing thing.

32:05.505 --> 32:07.960
(groaning)

32:28.996 --> 32:31.630
(inhales sharply)

32:38.338 --> 32:40.305
Did... Did I win?

32:40.307 --> 32:43.875
Well, the judge did pick you.

32:43.877 --> 32:46.044
(both chuckle softly)

32:52.052 --> 32:54.719
I...

32:54.721 --> 32:56.688
I died.

32:56.690 --> 33:00.702
I remember everything.

33:00.727 --> 33:03.025
You're a vampire.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.830
And now,

33:05.832 --> 33:09.334
so are you.

33:09.336 --> 33:13.905
Well, at least, you're becoming one.

33:15.791 --> 33:19.811
You have 24 hours to drink
human blood, or... well...

33:19.813 --> 33:21.780
that's the end.

33:23.266 --> 33:25.617
There's a way to live with this.

33:25.619 --> 33:28.720
I know it sounds bad, but you're alive.

33:28.722 --> 33:30.461
You're still you.

33:30.486 --> 33:33.320
Drinking blood? Killing people?

33:33.345 --> 33:35.771
That's... That's not
me. I don't want this.

33:35.796 --> 33:37.562
I'm... I'm not saying it's
going to be easy, but...

33:37.564 --> 33:38.630
Please, please, just...

33:38.632 --> 33:39.898
kill me.

33:39.900 --> 33:41.566
Quickly.

33:41.568 --> 33:43.613
Send me to a better place.

33:43.638 --> 33:46.604
Okay.

33:46.606 --> 33:49.574
You want to know what I did
after I became a vampire?

33:49.576 --> 33:51.943
I graduated.

33:51.945 --> 33:56.047
I went to college. I
became a news anchor.

33:56.049 --> 33:58.249
There are downsides.

33:58.251 --> 34:00.885
Believe me.

34:00.887 --> 34:04.089
But the one very big positive

34:04.091 --> 34:08.025
is that life doesn't have
to stop after you die.

34:13.266 --> 34:14.933
So...

34:14.935 --> 34:17.735
I...

34:17.737 --> 34:19.804
have to drink blood,

34:19.806 --> 34:21.906
like...

34:21.908 --> 34:23.541
(hisses)

34:23.543 --> 34:26.177

Whoa! Easy, easy.

34:51.304 --> 34:52.303
Hey. It's okay.

34:52.304 --> 34:54.639
I'm not sirened. I'm not sirened.

34:54.641 --> 34:56.007
Oh, you're not sirened,
you're just plain stupid?

34:56.009 --> 34:58.576
I thought the point of stealing
this thing was to keep it a secret.

34:58.578 --> 35:00.278
Please. I guessed
what you two were doing

35:00.280 --> 35:02.947
