40:52.586 --> 40:54.482
- Oh, yeah.
Just like old times.

40:54.517 --> 40:57.068
- I think that's probably
the best way to understand

40:57.103 --> 40:58.689
Tony Bourdain on television,
is that

40:58.724 --> 41:00.517
he was nominally
the host of these shows,

41:00.551 --> 41:02.724
but he really was
the ultimate guest.

41:02.758 --> 41:04.482
[laughter]

41:04.517 --> 41:05.689
[indistinct singing]

41:05.724 --> 41:07.172
- Just 'cause I'm
a bit of a dick,

41:07.206 --> 41:08.517
I have to ask this question.
- No, I love it.

41:08.551 --> 41:10.586
- Oh, okay.
[laughter]

41:10.620 --> 41:12.655
[cheers and applause]

41:12.689 --> 41:14.241
Well, I hope the food's good
at this thing.

41:14.275 --> 41:16.413
- It's so important
to Tony's mission

41:16.448 --> 41:19.379
to remember that to
eat the food of the world,

41:19.413 --> 41:22.000
you don't have to have
a lot of frequent flyer miles.

41:22.034 --> 41:23.896
You don't have to have
a lot of money.

41:23.931 --> 41:26.413
- Tony's part of history,

41:26.448 --> 41:27.896
everywhere's history,

41:27.931 --> 41:29.586
every nation's history.

41:29.620 --> 41:32.379
- The excess of evil
may not exist in him.

41:32.413 --> 41:33.931
So just normal evil

41:33.965 --> 41:36.206
like everybody else, yeah?
[laughter]

41:36.241 --> 41:37.862
- You were a guy who
at various points in life

41:37.896 --> 41:39.482
has pretty much
one way or the other

41:39.517 --> 41:41.724
been able
to have a lot of things

41:41.758 --> 41:45.931
that ordinary people
would never have.

41:45.965 --> 41:47.206
- Yeah.

41:47.241 --> 41:48.344
- You've had
many, many adventures.

41:48.379 --> 41:50.413
- I know.
- Given that,

41:50.448 --> 41:54.310
what thrills you now?

41:54.344 --> 41:57.862
- The nicest stuff right now--
this is very embarrassing,

41:57.896 --> 41:59.758
but it's really emb--

41:59.793 --> 42:03.034
being loved and actually

42:03.068 --> 42:05.413
appreciating the people
that are giving that to me.

42:05.448 --> 42:09.344
♪

42:09.379 --> 42:11.724
- And I guess that's what
we all want as human beings,

42:11.758 --> 42:15.000
isn't it?
To be loved, to be cherished.

42:15.034 --> 42:17.931
- This is Anthony Bourdain, CNN.

42:17.965 --> 42:19.896
Good night, and eat more SPAM.
