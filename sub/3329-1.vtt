WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:03.768
Previously on Elementary...
How much heroin is that?

00:03.800 --> 00:05.028
Oh, it's enough.

00:05.070 --> 00:06.059
You said you, uh, you had

00:06.100 --> 00:07.135
something you wished
to discuss.

00:07.170 --> 00:08.489
I'm moving out.

00:08.540 --> 00:10.269
Of?
The brownstone.

00:10.310 --> 00:12.130
I-I need to get my own place.
It's time.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.569
For the sake
of our partnership...

00:14.610 --> 00:15.634
stay.

00:15.680 --> 00:16.749
We will work this out.

00:16.780 --> 00:18.042
I know we will.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.775
I-I would like
to see the apartment

00:19.820 --> 00:21.173
as soon as possible.

00:21.220 --> 00:22.539
Yes, one person.

00:24.690 --> 00:27.352
HOLMES:
Several days ago,

00:27.390 --> 00:29.585
Mr. Sherrington made me
an offer of employment.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.518
He thought I could be of
great assistance to M16.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.152
Was he acting on orders?

00:33.200 --> 00:35.191
The offer came from me.

00:35.230 --> 00:36.697
Well, in that case,

00:36.730 --> 00:39.130
I'd very much like
to take you up on it.

00:40.340 --> 00:43.138
Joan, you look amazing.

00:43.170 --> 00:46.207
One of these days, you're gonna
have to tell me your secret.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.174
You know there's
no secret, Elana.

00:48.210 --> 00:50.178
It's about living right.

00:50.210 --> 00:52.678
Making smart decisions.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.142
You changed your hair.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.477
Yeah.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.215
Do you like it?

00:57.250 --> 00:58.683
Kind of needed a change.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.119
Of course you did.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.128
New look for a new life, right?
Mm.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.855
I mean, you're running
a narcotics cartel now.

01:03.890 --> 01:05.755
You have to look your best.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.522
How long have we known
each other now, Joan?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.765
Six months?
Let's see.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.633
It would've been a few days
after... your husband

01:14.670 --> 01:17.309
was assassinated by members
of the Otero cartel.

01:17.340 --> 01:20.275
Right before you took
over the business.

01:20.310 --> 01:21.470
So, yes!

01:21.510 --> 01:24.149
Six months sounds about right.

01:24.180 --> 01:27.877
I know how crazy
this is making you.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.184
Trying to convince everyone

01:30.220 --> 01:32.188
I'm some sort of mastermind?

01:32.220 --> 01:34.654
But it's fiction.
(cell phone dings)

01:37.290 --> 01:39.258
I know a few cops.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.120
I'll bet you do.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.593
And they are telling me

01:42.630 --> 01:45.326
that you are
embarrassing yourself.

01:45.370 --> 01:46.735
I don't know.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.590
I just think it's
sad, that's all.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.335
Oh. Well, then you'll
be glad to know

01:50.370 --> 01:52.804
that I finally figured it out.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.569
I understand _how
the cartel IS running now.

01:54.610 --> 01:57.340
You forced all of your husband's
key lieutenants out

01:57.380 --> 01:58.847
and replaced them with women.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.713
The one person
you didn't replace was a man

02:01.750 --> 02:03.479
who everyone thought
was doing your books.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.385
Isidro Beltran.

02:05.420 --> 02:08.287
But then I realized
the only reason

02:08.320 --> 02:10.254
you kept him there was
as a figurehead.

02:10.290 --> 02:11.587
A distraction.

02:11.630 --> 02:14.554
The actual bookkeeper
is a woman named Karen Lloyd,

02:14.600 --> 02:16.295
who lives in Connecticut.

02:16.330 --> 02:19.197
She comes into the city
every few weeks to, uh,

02:19.240 --> 02:21.196
organize the cartel's finances.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.707
Right now, she's staying

02:22.740 --> 02:25.607
at a penthouse
that you own on 57th Street.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.529
That's the real reason
I asked you to lunch.

02:28.580 --> 02:30.241
I wanted you and your squad

02:30.280 --> 02:31.747
of bodyguards away from there

02:31.780 --> 02:34.248
so that my colleagues
could pick her up without

02:34.280 --> 02:35.941
any trouble.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.789
According to this text
I just received,

02:37.820 --> 02:40.209
she's already talking deal.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.454
Elana March.

02:41.490 --> 02:43.856
You're under arrest.

02:43.890 --> 02:46.723
You have the right
to remain silent

02:46.760 --> 02:48.557
and to refuse
to answer questions.

02:48.600 --> 02:49.965
REPORTER:
This was the scene

02:50.000 --> 02:51.467
when alleged
"Country Club Capa"

02:51.500 --> 02:53.639
Elana March
was arrested last month.

02:53.670 --> 02:56.366
Today, her legal dream team
added yet another member.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.230
But sources
at the D.A.'s office...

02:58.270 --> 02:59.339
Maybe I should
come back later?

02:59.380 --> 03:01.803
Oh. Sorry.
It was a previous case.

03:01.840 --> 03:05.378
So, your disappearing
custom marble tile.

03:05.410 --> 03:07.514
I reviewed
your security footage.

03:07.550 --> 03:09.848
I went back a few weeks from
before the tiles were stolen.

03:09.890 --> 03:10.982
And I noticed

03:11.020 --> 03:13.215
the palettes
under these boxes

03:13.260 --> 03:14.386
are perfectly level.

03:14.420 --> 03:15.557
No buckling at all, which means

03:15.590 --> 03:17.478
they're carrying no weight.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.454
The tiles weren't sto_len
because they never eXIsted.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.219
Danny.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.623
Yes, your brother
faked the orders.

03:24.670 --> 03:26.535
And filled your warehouse
with empty boxes.

03:26.570 --> 03:28.367
He skimmed the money.
He has a gambling problem.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.607
(cell phone ringing)

03:32.340 --> 03:33.705
Mm. I have to take this.

03:33.740 --> 03:35.401
So, here's the full report.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.476
And your bill.
Yeah.

03:37.510 --> 03:38.579
Don't kill him.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.248
Just get him help, okay?

03:40.280 --> 03:42.748
Thanks.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.883
Hey, Marcus.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.387
Is everything okay?

03:46.420 --> 03:48.251
There's about to be a murder.

03:48.290 --> 03:50.383
I'm gonna kill our star witness.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.819
Karen wants to go over
courthouse security... again.

03:52.860 --> 03:54.498
Well, you told her
that I went over

03:54.530 --> 03:55.929
everything personally, right?

03:55.960 --> 03:58.292
I told her.
She's still freaking out.

03:58.330 --> 03:59.991
I got to get her
to the preliminary hearing.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.338
But she won't leave
until she's conVInced

04:02.370 --> 04:04.804
the courtroom is going
to be safe. I hate to ask,

04:04.840 --> 04:06.330
but can you come down here
and hold her hand?

04:06.380 --> 04:08.530
Yeah. I'll be right over.

04:09.810 --> 04:12.040
Oh.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.911
Uh, sorry. I, um,

04:13.950 --> 04:15.918
I was gonna knock. I...

04:15.950 --> 04:18.384
Have you seen a lizard?

04:18.420 --> 04:19.682
Excuse me?

04:19.720 --> 04:21.358
I'm Andrew Mittal.

04:21.390 --> 04:23.358
Uh, Doug's brother, 6D.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.358
Oh! He cooks
with a lot of garlic

04:25.390 --> 04:26.698
and plays a lot
of Call of Duty?

04:26.730 --> 04:28.357
Yeah, Doug's a-a primate.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.618
But I'm-I'm house-sitting
for him and I appear

04:30.670 --> 04:32.399
to have misplaced
his bearded dragon,

04:32.440 --> 04:33.998
which is not good for anybody.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.305
Um, well, I haven't seen it
and I have a meeting.

04:37.340 --> 04:39.831
But...

04:41.340 --> 04:42.341
Ah, there he is.

04:44.380 --> 04:45.779
How did you know
he'd be in here?

04:45.810 --> 04:47.016
I didn't.

04:47.050 --> 04:48.517
But the pipes get warm
and reptiles

04:48.550 --> 04:49.847
like warm places, so...

04:49.890 --> 04:50.948
I have a turtle.

04:50.990 --> 04:52.514
’gi; F15;
:5:er ;

04:52.560 --> 04:55.484
If there's anything I
can do to thank you...

04:55.520 --> 04:57.385
No. I really have to go.

04:57.430 --> 04:59.398
But, um, you know what?

04:59.430 --> 05:01.751
Here's my card
if he goes missing again.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.098
I'm really good
at finding things.

05:04.130 --> 05:06.963
There's nothing
to worry about, Karen.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.639
We're gonna keep you safe.

05:09.670 --> 05:11.035
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

05:11.070 --> 05:12.879
I sound like a crazy woman.
No.

05:12.910 --> 05:15.572
What you sound like is someone
who understands how dangerous

05:15.610 --> 05:17.475
Elana March is.
Now, the good news is

05:17.510 --> 05:19.068
you're not the only one.

05:19.110 --> 05:22.113
Well, thank you
for coming down here.

05:22.150 --> 05:24.345
It's no trouble.

05:24.390 --> 05:25.812
But we should get you
to the courthouse.

05:25.850 --> 05:28.387
We don't want to keep
the judge waiting.

05:31.460 --> 05:33.098
Palmer to all units.

05:33.130 --> 05:34.927
The package is on its way.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.360
(elevator dings)

05:39.540 --> 05:42.338
So, I'll wrap up here
and meet you at the courthouse.

05:44.870 --> 05:46.633
You'll be there, too, right?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.671
Yes, of course.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.486
I know. That woman.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.738
She's gonna ask me
to adopt her, isn't she?

05:58.790 --> 06:00.519
You've had worse roommates.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.755
Well, yeah.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.587
Six months and
still no word, huh?

06:04.630 --> 06:06.894
I'm sure M16
is keeping him busy.

06:06.930 --> 06:08.898
(alarm beeping)
What's going on?

06:08.930 --> 06:11.524
Something's happened!

06:11.570 --> 06:13.936
(siren wailing)

06:21.980 --> 06:24.574
DETECTIVE:
We watched the elevator
all the way down.

06:24.610 --> 06:25.941
It never stopped.

06:25.980 --> 06:28.574
They were alone in there.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.611
How the hell
did this happen?

06:38.990 --> 06:42.596
WATSON: Okay. For the 10,000th
time, Karen Lloyd and Palmer

06:42.630 --> 06:45.724
enter the elevator alone
on the let floor.

06:45.770 --> 06:48.091
The car makes no stops
and arrives in the garage

06:48.140 --> 06:50.938
31 seconds later,
the exact amount of time

06:50.970 --> 06:52.801
the manufacturer
said it would take.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.034
But the doors
open, and both

06:54.080 --> 06:55.934
Palmer and Lloyd
have been shot.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.777
The shooter had to have come in

06:57.810 --> 06:59.869
through the access panel
in the ceiling.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.649
Only the panel has a built-in
mechanism that prevents it

07:01.680 --> 07:03.819
from opening when the elevator
is in motion.

07:03.850 --> 07:06.978
Yeah, but obviously somebody
got on that elevator car.

07:07.020 --> 07:09.181
Ballistics said the shooter
was level with his victims.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.950
Which means that our guy didn't
just open the panel and fire.

07:11.990 --> 07:14.049
He actually lowered himself
into the car.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.092
When you called last night, you
said you might have a new lead.

07:17.130 --> 07:18.995
Guy named Sosa?

07:19.030 --> 07:20.930
Yeah, Romero.

07:20.970 --> 07:23.530
He'd done this kind of work
for Elana's husband before.

07:25.170 --> 07:26.706
I heard rumors that
she pulled him

07:26.740 --> 07:28.173
back into the organization.

07:28.210 --> 07:30.576
But as it turns out, he was
at his niece's quinceaera

07:30.610 --> 07:31.907
at the time of the shootings.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.212
Joan?

07:33.250 --> 07:34.808
It's time.

07:34.850 --> 07:37.114
(sighs)

07:37.150 --> 07:38.686
We have been more
than forthcoming

07:38.720 --> 07:40.085
in this investigation,
Captain.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.055
In fact, we have
been very generous.

07:43.090 --> 07:45.058
But we called this meeting
because now there is

07:45.090 --> 07:47.149
a pattern of harassment.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.849
Ms. Bracken, as long
as your client

07:48.900 --> 07:50.162
remains a person of interest

07:50.200 --> 07:52.065
in the murder of Karen Lloyd

07:52.100 --> 07:54.568
and one of my men,
we will investigate

07:54.600 --> 07:57.535
any and all possibilities.

07:57.570 --> 07:59.538
It isn't harassment.

07:59.580 --> 08:03.607
These were taken in front
of my daughter's school.

08:03.650 --> 08:07.074
This one, this one

08:07.120 --> 08:08.917
and this one.

08:08.950 --> 08:11.783
If you don't like the
word "harassment,"

08:11.820 --> 08:14.084
maybe "stalking"
is a better ﬁt.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.111
BRACKEN:
Pull her leash, Captain.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.082
Keep her away
from my client.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.126
(door closes)

08:26.170 --> 08:29.139
I-I can't protect you
if you pull stunts like this.

08:29.170 --> 08:30.762
One of the other
mothers at the school

08:30.810 --> 08:31.868
is involved in
March's busmess.

08:31.910 --> 08:33.172
I am sure of it.

08:33.210 --> 08:34.700
I thought they were talking
shop on the grounds.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.640
Oh.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.001
You know the real reason
she brought

08:39.050 --> 08:41.314
those photos today, right?

08:41.350 --> 08:44.183
She wants you to know
that she's got eyes on you.

08:44.220 --> 08:45.778
That she can get to you.

08:45.820 --> 08:48.311
Watch your back, okay?

08:48.360 --> 08:51.079
(door opens)

08:51.130 --> 08:53.758
(door closes)

09:08.780 --> 09:10.077
ANDREW:
Hey.

09:10.110 --> 09:11.202
Hey!

09:13.150 --> 09:15.072
You know you're late.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.269
I have to be back
at the station

09:16.320 --> 09:18.049
in 45 minutes.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.580
The guys at Giancarlo's
are artists.

09:19.620 --> 09:21.759
You think they care
about our schedules?

09:21.790 --> 09:24.657
Besides, I tried
calling you twice.

09:24.690 --> 09:25.884
My phone never rang.

09:25.930 --> 09:27.727
It figures.

09:27.760 --> 09:28.897
Park's between two towers.

09:28.930 --> 09:30.864
It's a total dead zone.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.133
Not for her it isn't.

09:36.170 --> 09:38.809
You know,
just give me a second.

09:41.810 --> 09:44.074
Excuse me?

09:44.110 --> 09:46.078
I think you and I have
a mutual friend.

09:46.110 --> 09:47.668
Her name is Elana.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.814
She pays people to take
pictures of me sometimes.

09:50.850 --> 09:54.115
Babe, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.116
What's your problem?

09:56.160 --> 09:57.752
My problem is that
I don't like being followed.

09:57.790 --> 09:59.929
Your problem is that I know
what you look like now.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.155
You're nuts.

10:09.370 --> 10:10.337
GREGSON:
Joan?

10:10.370 --> 10:12.258
(door opens)
Hey.

10:12.310 --> 10:14.631
I don't want to get your hopes
up, but someone wrote in

10:14.680 --> 10:16.807
with a tip on the hotel murders.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.819
A guy named Montcliffe Ekuban.

10:19.850 --> 10:22.148
BELL:
He says we ought to be looking
at a guest who checked in

10:22.180 --> 10:23.317
as "John Mason."

10:23.350 --> 10:24.886
Our tipster says
his real name

10:24.920 --> 10:26.808
is Kevin Elspeth,
who is, get this--

10:26.860 --> 10:29.852
"the subject of persistent
rumors in my native Germany.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.188
"There are whispers he is
a high-end assassin.

10:32.230 --> 10:35.119
"If true, it cannot be
a coincidence that he was

10:35.160 --> 10:38.721
staying at the hotel
when Karen Lloyd was killed."

10:38.770 --> 10:40.431
"If true," being
the operative phrase there.

10:40.470 --> 10:43.132
Well, I almost filed that
directly in the crazy pile,

10:43.170 --> 10:44.660
but then I figured...

10:44.710 --> 10:45.904
We're nowhere
after two months

10:45.940 --> 10:47.202
and we're
getting desperate.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.128
GREGSON:
Well, that Elspeth
is local...

10:49.180 --> 10:51.239
easy to run down.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.148
What is it?

10:55.180 --> 10:57.978
Uh... it's just the name.

10:58.020 --> 10:58.987
What, Elspeth?

10:59.020 --> 11:01.181
No, Montcliffe Ekuban.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.825
I know it from someplace.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.980
(slowly flicks
light switch on and off)

11:58.210 --> 12:00.019
*

12:17.300 --> 12:20.064
(clattering)

12:20.100 --> 12:22.295
(distant whooshing)

12:31.410 --> 12:33.139
(whooshing continues)

12:42.390 --> 12:44.984
You can take the helmet off.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.090
Watson.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.548
I apologize if the helmet
gave you a scare.

13:04.580 --> 13:07.469
It's an Isolator,
invented in 1925,

13:07.520 --> 13:09.044
to encourage focus
and concentration by...

13:09.080 --> 13:10.149
I didn't come here
to talk about

13:10.190 --> 13:11.111
some stupid helmet, okay?

13:11.150 --> 13:12.378
I came here, because I realized

13:12.420 --> 13:13.409
that you were the one

13:13.460 --> 13:15.587
who tipped Gregson off
to Kevin Elspeth today.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.520
Montcliffe and Ekuban...

13:17.560 --> 13:18.959
they were criminologists

13:18.990 --> 13:20.196
during the Victorian era.

13:20.230 --> 13:21.492
You had me read their books

13:21.530 --> 13:23.020
when you were training me.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.822
You were supposed to make

13:24.870 --> 13:26.292
that connection.

13:26.330 --> 13:27.968
I wanted you
to see it for

13:28.000 --> 13:29.467
the olive branch
that it was--

13:29.500 --> 13:31.263
I expected it--
what I did not expect...

13:31.310 --> 13:33.073
was you coming here.

13:33.110 --> 13:34.475
I had planned a more...

13:34.510 --> 13:36.842
formal announcement
of my arrival...

13:36.880 --> 13:38.507
in New York, but...
now that you're here...

13:38.550 --> 13:39.949
I don't care
that you're back.

13:39.980 --> 13:41.345
I don't care
why you're back.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.439
I just want you to stay
out of my case.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.082
The case that, until today,
had failed to connect

13:45.120 --> 13:47.054
Kevin Elspeth to the murders
of a protected witness

13:47.090 --> 13:48.910
and a New York City
Police Detective?

13:52.160 --> 13:54.390
I first learned of Elspeth
while investigating

13:54.430 --> 13:57.024
a separate murder
in Germany in 2007.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.530
I was unable to prove that

14:01.570 --> 14:03.128
he was the culprit, but...

14:03.170 --> 14:04.467
I'm quite convinced
he has committed

14:04.510 --> 14:06.068
multiple assassinations.

14:06.110 --> 14:07.600
The alias
he used here

14:07.640 --> 14:09.039
in New York,
"John Mason,"

14:09.080 --> 14:10.240
it refers to
the perpetrator

14:10.280 --> 14:11.975
of the infamous
"Mystic Massacre"

14:12.010 --> 14:14.012
of the Pequot Indians.

14:14.050 --> 14:16.211
I found a number
of Similar aliases...

14:16.250 --> 14:18.115
all staying in cities
where exotic murders occurred

14:18.150 --> 14:20.948
and all referencing
a notorious figure.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.150
"John Herod,"
was in Paris

14:22.190 --> 14:23.987
when a hedge fund manager
was killed.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.622
"John Bathory..."
If Elspeth had anything

14:25.660 --> 14:26.957
to do with what happened..

14:27.000 --> 14:28.956
I would've gotten
to him myself.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.468
Are you worried
I plan to take the credit?

14:31.500 --> 14:33.468
I'm disappointed,
Watson.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.331
I warned you repeatedly

14:35.370 --> 14:37.008
over the course
of our partnership...

14:37.040 --> 14:38.507
There is no partnership!

14:38.540 --> 14:39.632
You ended it in that note

14:39.670 --> 14:42.275
you left me eight months ago.

14:42.310 --> 14:44.676
The one that was five
whole sentences long.

14:44.710 --> 14:47.110
I concede _the note
was a mistake.

14:47.150 --> 14:49.038
I should have bid
my farewells in person.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.184
Yes, you should have.

14:51.220 --> 14:53.654
But the truth is,
you were right...

14:53.690 --> 14:55.089
I didn't need you anymore.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.051
I still don't.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.093
(door closes)

15:07.600 --> 15:09.431
Captain.
(grunts)

15:14.280 --> 15:15.975
Captain.

15:16.010 --> 15:18.171
Holmes.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.610
(indistinct conversation)

15:22.280 --> 15:24.248
You coming in or what?

15:24.290 --> 15:25.985
(clears throat)

15:31.130 --> 15:32.154
(sighs)

15:34.200 --> 15:35.690
You look well, Captain.

15:35.730 --> 15:37.129
Very well.

15:39.270 --> 15:40.965
It saddens me, of course,
to realize that your efforts

15:41.000 --> 15:42.490
to resurrect your marriage
were for naught.

15:43.740 --> 15:46.208
Well, I see you've
found someone else?

15:46.240 --> 15:47.969
A fair-haired lady.

15:48.010 --> 15:49.204
Athletic, approximately
five-foot-nine.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.605
Tell me you didn't
come here

15:50.650 --> 15:52.299
to do parlor tricks.

15:52.350 --> 15:54.375
I came here
to apologize.

15:54.420 --> 15:57.184
I owed you and
Detective Bell

15:57.220 --> 15:58.642
a proper good-bye
before I left.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.654
It was
a difficult time,

16:03.330 --> 16:05.389
I was thinking of
no one but myself.

16:05.430 --> 16:06.658
Must have been a day

16:06.690 --> 16:08.658
that ended in "Y."
(sighs)

16:10.030 --> 16:11.065
How are things at MI6?

16:11.100 --> 16:13.136
The other reason
I'm here--

16:13.170 --> 16:14.364
no longer with them...

16:14.400 --> 16:15.731
creative differences...

16:15.770 --> 16:17.135
I'm afraid.

16:20.610 --> 16:22.237
You got fired

16:22.280 --> 16:23.702
and now you want
your old job back.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.638
I do not lack for
other opportunities,

16:25.680 --> 16:27.648
I assure you.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.046
But I have a certain
comfort level here.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.739
And a good deal
to make up for;

16:31.790 --> 16:33.382
my exit was the
very opposite

16:33.420 --> 16:34.512
of professional.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.016
You think
I was mad at you,

16:36.060 --> 16:37.527
because you didn't
come give me a hug

16:37.560 --> 16:40.199
before you went back
to London?

16:40.230 --> 16:41.254
We're not friends.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.222
I like you--

16:43.270 --> 16:44.567
I want good things
for you...

16:44.600 --> 16:47.194
but our relationship...

16:47.240 --> 16:49.265
it's a means to an end

16:49.300 --> 16:51.302
as much to me
as it is to you.

16:53.140 --> 16:54.129
We just never said that

16:54.180 --> 16:55.670
out loud before.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.200
Which is a good thing,

16:57.250 --> 16:58.399
because it makes it easier

16:58.450 --> 16:59.599
for me to say,

16:59.650 --> 17:00.776
"You want to come back?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.276
"Sure.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.184
"You want to leave again?

17:03.220 --> 17:04.482
That's fine, too."

17:04.520 --> 17:06.112
But the work

17:06.150 --> 17:08.516
needs to be exceptional.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.425
I'm very grateful,
Captain.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.325
Well, don't thank me yet.

17:12.360 --> 17:14.794
It isn't up to me.

17:14.830 --> 17:16.127
It's up to Joan.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.593
She's done a hell of a job

17:17.630 --> 17:18.665
since you've been gone.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.190
And if she
were to leave

17:20.240 --> 17:21.434
because of some
deCI5ion I made,

17:21.470 --> 17:23.131
let's just say,

17:23.170 --> 17:25.809
that wouldn't be
as easy to hack.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.501
I understand;

17:27.540 --> 17:29.132
I'll have another
conversation with her.

17:29.180 --> 17:31.068
In the meantime, I'd like to
take this opportunity

17:31.110 --> 17:33.146
to apprise you of
an adjustment I have made

17:33.180 --> 17:34.841
with regards
to my practice.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.212
Should we res_ume
our collaboration...

17:37.250 --> 17:40.356
it will affect you
as much as it will Watson.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.151
WATSON:
According to the
hotel's register,

17:44.190 --> 17:45.327
that is "John Mason."

17:45.360 --> 17:46.850
_ _He bares a
striking resemblance

17:46.890 --> 17:49.256
to you, Mr. Elspeth.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.699
Why'd you check in
under an alias?

17:52.200 --> 17:53.667
I suppose you have me
dead to rights,

17:53.700 --> 17:54.792
SO...

17:54.840 --> 17:56.728
I confess.

17:56.770 --> 17:58.362
I went there
to hire an escort.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.469
If that's just you
looking for a date;

18:00.510 --> 18:01.807
why all the luggage?

18:01.840 --> 18:04.308
(smacks lips)
I'm a marketing consultant...

18:04.350 --> 18:05.476
sometimes when I'm immersed
in a prOJect,

18:05.510 --> 18:07.614
I'll hole up in a hotel
for a week or two;

18:07.650 --> 18:09.117
helps me focus.

18:09.150 --> 18:10.481
The girls help, too.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.385
It's _not the
sort of thing you want

18:12.420 --> 18:13.819
coming to light, so...

18:13.860 --> 18:15.282
So you're careful--

18:15.320 --> 18:16.719
maybe not careful enough.

18:16.760 --> 18:20.298
You were John Herod in Paris,
John Bathory in Tangier,

18:20.330 --> 18:22.491
John Dillinger
in Kyoto.
All notorious Johns.

18:22.530 --> 18:25.124
It's my sense of humor.
What's this about?

18:25.170 --> 18:27.138
Prostitution isn't even illegal
in some of these places.

18:27.170 --> 18:29.263
Murder is.
BELL:
There was

18:29.300 --> 18:31.268
_an elaborate assassination
in every one of those Cities

18:31.310 --> 18:33.278
within days of
you arriving.

18:33.310 --> 18:37.303
A judge here, a politician
there, a couple of executives.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.272
Anyone for a
price, right?
(scoffs)

18:39.310 --> 18:41.471
You have me confused
With someone. _
Don't expect us to believe

18:41.520 --> 18:43.181
that this is a coincidence.

18:43.220 --> 18:45.188
Two days after you
checked in to this hotel,

18:45.220 --> 18:47.859
you added a state's witness
and a cop to your rsum.

18:47.890 --> 18:50.620
You're referring to Karen Lloyd.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.685
I heard about it on the news.

18:52.730 --> 18:54.698
We're gonna tie you
to one of these hits.

18:54.730 --> 18:57.699
Now, until then, you've got
a window of opportunity.

18:57.730 --> 18:59.459
We want
Elana March.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.361
Karen Lloyd, and we'll
put you with a DA.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.298
who will appreciate
your cooperation.

19:06.340 --> 19:08.308
You've got more leverage
to cut a deal now

19:08.340 --> 19:09.932
than you ever
will again.

19:09.980 --> 19:11.709
Is that all?

19:11.750 --> 19:12.944
That's all.

19:12.980 --> 19:14.379
Then I thank you,

19:14.420 --> 19:16.411
and I wish you Godspeed
in your investigation.

19:16.450 --> 19:18.748
I'm sure it'll clear my name.

19:18.790 --> 19:22.282
Well, whoever Montcliffe Ekuban
is, I'd like to buy him a beer.

19:22.320 --> 19:25.289
Kevin Elspeth is suspicious
as hell. He's cocky, too.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.854
He's gotten away
with murder before.

19:26.890 --> 19:29.222
Yeah, well, I'm about
to head back to the office.

19:29.260 --> 19:31.694
Japan's gonna wake up. I want to
see if he left a trace in Kyoto.

19:31.730 --> 19:33.698
You want a ride?
No, I'm headed uptown.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.696
There's a caf across
from March's office.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.605
I'm gonna camp out, see if
he reaches out in person.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.370
All right. My advice?
Cut 'em a wide berth.

19:40.410 --> 19:42.298
(alarm chirps)

19:45.780 --> 19:48.772
(engine starts)

20:08.340 --> 20:10.808
_Don't move. _
The police are on their way.

20:24.020 --> 20:25.487
(shouts)

20:25.520 --> 20:27.488
(panﬁng)

20:27.520 --> 20:30.626
Those were singlestick moves.
How the hell do you know...

20:30.660 --> 20:32.787
Singlestick.

20:32.830 --> 20:35.390
You don't work for March.

20:35.430 --> 20:37.466
You work for Sherlock.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.491
(English accent):
I don't work for anyone.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.863
I'm his new partner.

20:51.350 --> 20:54.911
Tell me exactly
what you said.
I told her I was your partner.

20:54.950 --> 20:56.269
So you lied to her.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.288
Did I?

20:58.320 --> 20:59.309
What else?

20:59.350 --> 21:01.056
Nothing.

21:01.090 --> 21:03.285
She wasn't the
least bit curious

21:03.330 --> 21:04.581
as to why you
were following her?

21:04.630 --> 21:06.518
Yeah, of course she was.

21:07.660 --> 21:10.026
I told her it was none
of her damn business.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.664
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

21:11.700 --> 21:13.019
But she hit me, and Ijust...

21:13.070 --> 21:14.389
I could not have
been clearer

21:14.440 --> 21:15.634
last night.

21:15.670 --> 21:17.331
I told you that any
and all surveillance

21:17.370 --> 21:20.635
of Wa_tson was to
cease immediately.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.500
I was bored.

21:22.540 --> 21:23.848
You went to get the power
turned back on.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.575
Can you blame me for being
just a little bit curious?

21:25.610 --> 21:26.804
Yes, I can.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.943
She's the original model.

21:28.980 --> 21:30.538
The one you never
shut up about.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.545
You didn't think
I'd want to see

21:31.590 --> 21:32.818
what she's got
that I don't?

21:32.850 --> 21:33.851
What she has

21:33.890 --> 21:35.687
is two years of training.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.553
Two years of doing
exactly what I said.

21:39.990 --> 21:41.594
I told you
before we left London,

21:41.630 --> 21:43.518
I have plans here
for both of us.

21:43.570 --> 21:46.061
Do you remember our plans?

21:50.070 --> 21:51.901
I'm sorry, okay?

21:51.940 --> 21:53.578
Don't be sorry.

21:53.610 --> 21:55.407
Be better.

21:56.780 --> 21:58.441
Earlier I had you organize
these writing samples

21:58.480 --> 22:00.072
in decreasing order
of the authors'

22:00.110 --> 22:03.443
potential sexual deviancy.

22:04.650 --> 22:06.948
Do it again.

22:11.690 --> 22:13.692
(elevator bell dings)

22:14.930 --> 22:15.999
Going up?

22:16.030 --> 22:17.827
(sighs)

22:17.870 --> 22:20.737
Is this what you call
"staying out of my case"?

22:20.770 --> 22:22.635
Watson, try to understand.
A detective comes across

22:22.670 --> 22:24.137
only so many
locked room mysteries

22:24.170 --> 22:25.569
during the course
of their career.

22:25.610 --> 22:27.578
I myself have only ever
encountered seven.

22:27.610 --> 22:28.929
Ah, only seven.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.369
You've obviously come to examine
the scene of the crime.

22:31.410 --> 22:32.775
Knowing you,
it's some sort of ritual.

22:32.810 --> 22:33.845
Sorry, no.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.370
_ Stairs are
just over there.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.445
Thank you.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.946
Perhaps together
we can find something

22:38.990 --> 22:41.481
which escaped you
on a previous occasion.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.784
You want to ride the elevator,
ride the elevator.

22:45.690 --> 22:48.022
I'm here to look at the room
Kevm Elspeth stayed in.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.962
She's not my partner.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.036
She's my protge,

22:57.070 --> 22:59.106
as YOU once were.

22:59.140 --> 23:00.573
Are you talking
about the psychopath

23:00.610 --> 23:01.872
who attacked me with
a baton yesterday,

23:01.910 --> 23:03.673
the one who has
been stalking me?

23:03.710 --> 23:05.177
Yeah, about the stalking...

23:05.210 --> 23:07.041
Wait, is this the part
where you tell me

23:07.080 --> 23:08.547
that it was on your orders?

23:08.580 --> 23:10.741
Wow, I never would have
figured that out.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.587
(elevator bell dings)

23:16.720 --> 23:18.950
I had to determine how
you'd fared in my absence.

23:18.990 --> 23:21.891
I wanted to know exactly
how much to apologize for.

23:21.930 --> 23:24.091
Over the course of
the last week, however,

23:24.130 --> 23:25.961
it's become clear that
you've done remarkably well.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.560
"Last week"? That woman has
been following me for a week?

23:28.600 --> 23:29.897
(grunts) I'm torn, really.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.635
I'm proud of her surveillance.

23:31.670 --> 23:33.501
I'm disappointed in your
failure to detect it.

23:33.540 --> 23:34.871
Well, you're not
my teacher anymore,

23:34.910 --> 23:36.605
so I don't care how you feel
about anything I'm doing.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.642
So please, for the
last time, butt out.

23:38.680 --> 23:39.647
(lock beeps and clicks)

23:46.690 --> 23:48.055
I was afraid, Watson.

23:48.090 --> 23:49.648
That's why I left.

23:51.730 --> 23:54.619
I'd laid my hands on
a small amount of heroin, and...

23:57.830 --> 23:59.593
(sighs)

23:59.630 --> 24:00.995
It was a test, you see.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.736
A means to demonstrate
how far I'd come.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.537
Could I keep it close to me

24:06.570 --> 24:08.128
without, uh...

24:08.180 --> 24:09.738
(sighs)

24:09.780 --> 24:11.008
And then you announced
you were leaving,

24:11.050 --> 24:12.802
and, uh, I got angry.

24:12.850 --> 24:16.741
'Cause I knew immediately
I would fail.

24:18.820 --> 24:19.889
I resented you, Watson,

24:19.920 --> 24:21.649
when I should've
resented myself.

24:23.790 --> 24:25.155
So I ran away.

24:25.190 --> 24:26.521
From you, from the brownstone

24:26.560 --> 24:28.596
and from the drugs I kept there.

24:28.630 --> 24:31.167
Because of course there are
no drugs in London.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.622
It was a new challenge.

24:32.670 --> 24:34.797
A new test.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.728
(chuckles) And in
the event I failed,

24:36.770 --> 24:39.762
it would not be
right in front of you.

24:42.580 --> 24:44.571
It was good.

24:44.610 --> 24:46.077
My sobriety remained intact.

24:46.110 --> 24:48.908
And I came to_ a series
of realizations.

24:48.950 --> 24:50.918
First and foremost,
that it was wrong

24:50.950 --> 24:52.918
to make you the face
of my problem.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.053
(shutter clicks)

24:54.090 --> 24:55.614
Secondly,

24:55.660 --> 24:57.787
that the experience
I'd had with you,

24:57.830 --> 25:01.220
the one that had kept me focused
and grounded,

25:01.260 --> 25:02.989
could be replicated.

25:04.730 --> 25:06.618
I'm a mentor, Watson.

25:06.670 --> 25:08.194
I'm-I'm a teacher.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.731
It struck me like a thunderbolt.

25:10.770 --> 25:13.568
I realized it wasn't you
I was afraid of losing,

25:13.610 --> 25:14.736
not really.

25:14.780 --> 25:16.532
It was our relationship.

25:16.580 --> 25:18.002
The mechanics of it.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.642
The give and the take.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.840
(shutter clicks)

25:20.880 --> 25:22.871
So I realized I
could do it again.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.218
So you dug up that girl.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.581
Kitty.

25:28.160 --> 25:31.220
I got into a baton fight
with someone named Kitty.

25:31.260 --> 25:33.285
Short for Kathryn, but...

25:33.330 --> 25:35.992
Kitty is her strong preference,
so...

25:44.370 --> 25:46.304
Obviously, no mere coincidence

25:46.340 --> 25:48.228
that Kevin Elspeth
reserved a room

25:48.280 --> 25:49.975
with a wall adjacent
to the lift shaft.

25:50.010 --> 25:52.706
Obviously, but surveillance
video from the hall

25:52.750 --> 25:54.172
showed that he never
left his room

25:54.220 --> 25:56.211
the morning
Karen Lloyd was shot.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.243
(sighs)

26:00.290 --> 26:01.882
He didn't shoot
through the walls.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.751
The bullets which killed her
and Detective Palmer

26:03.790 --> 26:05.326
were fired towards this room,

26:05.360 --> 26:06.850
not away from it.

26:06.890 --> 26:07.959
Not to mention the fact

26:08.000 --> 26:09.149
that the police
cleared this place

26:09.200 --> 26:10.929
floor by floor.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.995
I'm sure they would've noticed
four holes in the wall.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.759
(shutter clicks)

26:26.210 --> 26:27.814
If I was still your mentor,

26:27.850 --> 26:29.249
I would remind you how helpful
it can be

26:29.280 --> 26:30.781
to study a crime scene
from alternate perspectives,

26:30.820 --> 26:32.139
but...
Pretty sure

26:32.190 --> 26:33.339
he wasn't sitting
on the shower bench

26:33.390 --> 26:35.585
when he murdered two people.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.724
The captain is open
to taking me back.

26:41.030 --> 26:42.349
He's even supportive

26:42.400 --> 26:45.164
of my efforts with Kitty.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.088
You are, after all,
powerful proof

26:47.130 --> 26:48.358
of my ability to train others

26:48.400 --> 26:51.369
in the art
of detection.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.105
There is, uh, one condition.

26:53.140 --> 26:55.836
He'll only assent
with your blessing.

26:59.210 --> 27:01.917
I'm glad that you figured
so many things out.

27:01.950 --> 27:04.214
I am, but I've got

27:04.250 --> 27:06.241
a lot of work to do.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.819
(doorbell rings)

27:13.700 --> 27:15.759
Hi.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.360
You should know
I have a stun gun,

27:18.400 --> 27:19.924
just in case.

27:19.970 --> 27:21.289
Sherlock sent me a text.

27:21.340 --> 27:22.967
Actually, he sent me nine texts.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.661
He said I should come.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.769
Yeah, I know.

27:26.810 --> 27:28.801
He solved your
case for you.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.381
Karen Lloyd. Detective Palmer.

27:40.420 --> 27:43.412
For the last two months,
you've been asking yourself

27:43.460 --> 27:46.156
how a killer_was able
to enter a movmg elevator,

27:46.190 --> 27:48.329
shoot two people
and then flee the scene

27:48.360 --> 27:51.921
without leaving a trace
in mere moments.

27:51.970 --> 27:54.859
The answer is,
he did no such thing.

27:54.900 --> 27:56.936
Kitty said you have a theory?

27:56.970 --> 27:57.937
KITTY:
Actually, I said

27:57.970 --> 27:59.460
you solved it.

27:59.510 --> 28:01.239
More accurate to say
that we solved it.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.032
Your line of inquiry,
while misdirected,

28:03.080 --> 28:05.071
was essential.
What is it you think

28:05.110 --> 28:06.748
you're onto?

28:06.780 --> 28:11.012
A most novel modus operandi.

28:11.050 --> 28:13.018
Kitty wanted to know
why a practiced assassin

28:13.050 --> 28:14.915
like Kevin Elspeth
would use

28:14.960 --> 28:17.053
armor-piercing bullets
such as these

28:17.090 --> 28:19.229
in such tight quarters.

28:19.260 --> 28:21.399
The likelihood that his targets
would don bulletproof vests

28:21.430 --> 28:23.898
whilst still in the hotel
was... remote.

28:23.930 --> 28:25.898
And with the _element
of surprise,

28:25.930 --> 28:28.899
it would have been just as easy
to aim between their eyes.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.908
Ste_el-cor_e bullets
are incredibly lethal.

28:30.940 --> 28:32.430
I think it's safe
to assume that

28:32.470 --> 28:34.938
he wanted to be sure
that the targets would die.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.778
If that were all he wanted, he
only had to fire more bullets,

28:37.810 --> 28:38.970
of any caliber.

28:39.010 --> 28:40.443
And so it occurred to me

28:40.480 --> 28:42.971
he used these,
'cause they're the only type

28:43.020 --> 28:45.284
of rounds which are magnetic.

28:45.320 --> 28:46.947
(sets bullet down)

28:46.990 --> 28:48.457
(bullet clacks)

28:48.490 --> 28:50.117
What is that?

28:50.160 --> 28:51.889
It's an electromagnet.

28:51.930 --> 28:54.228
Albeit, a rather... puny one.

28:54.260 --> 28:57.127
Only about one one-hundredth
as powerful as the device

28:57.160 --> 29:00.789
that Kevin Elspeth assembled
in his hotel room.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.035
Please note, this model
is not to scale.

29:03.070 --> 29:05.800
The murder magnet--
likely a 20-Tesla unit--

29:05.840 --> 29:09.037
would have been just
about as big as a keg of beer.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.275
Nobody heard gunfire.

29:11.310 --> 29:13.278
We thought he used a silencer.

29:13.310 --> 29:16.177
Earlier today, I noticed
some very faint grooves

29:16.220 --> 29:19.519
between the paneling
in the side of the elevator.

29:19.550 --> 29:21.882
I've come to realize
that they were made

29:21.920 --> 29:27.381
when Elspeth jammed
four already-expended slugs...

29:27.430 --> 29:29.489
into the wall, just so.

29:29.530 --> 29:32.124
Then he sat back, and he
monitored the radio chatter

29:32.170 --> 29:33.933
of Ms. Lloyd's
protective detail.

29:33.970 --> 29:37.064
When he heard
she was on the move,
he flipped a switch,

29:37.100 --> 29:38.135
and...

29:38.170 --> 29:39.364
voil.

29:39.410 --> 29:41.833
Two dead targets...

29:41.880 --> 29:44.201
and every appearance
of a shooting.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.979
This is impressive.

29:46.010 --> 29:48.240
But is there any way
to prove it?

29:48.280 --> 29:49.577
No.

29:49.620 --> 29:53.317
It was, literally,
the perfect crime.

29:53.350 --> 29:56.057
Then why do you look so happy?

29:56.090 --> 29:57.921
_ Because while
this crime is perfect,

29:57.960 --> 30:00.087
the one that preceded it...

30:00.130 --> 30:01.893
was not.

30:01.930 --> 30:05.866
Mm... you think the killer
used a magnet?

30:05.900 --> 30:08.892
It would explain a lot--
like why there was so
little gunshot residue

30:08.940 --> 30:10.089
found at the scene.

30:10.140 --> 30:12.131
The bullets were shot
from a gun,

30:12.170 --> 30:13.979
just not that day--
that day they were pulled

30:14.010 --> 30:16.604
through the victims.
It would also explain
why one of the bullets

30:16.640 --> 30:18.198
missed completely.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.070
'Cause it wasn't aimed;
it was only positioned--

30:20.110 --> 30:22.169
at a height that would hit
Karen Lloyd between the chest

30:22.220 --> 30:23.983
and the head, just
like the other three.

30:24.020 --> 30:26.443
I didn't do it.

30:26.490 --> 30:29.516
You don't have a shred
of proof that I did.

30:29.560 --> 30:34.122
And I think my lawyer's
gonna have something to
say about this harassment.

30:36.630 --> 30:38.188
What's this?

30:38.230 --> 30:40.369
You said we didn't have
a shred of proof.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.368
That's not quite right.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.628
BELL: Ten days
before Ms. Lloyd

30:43.670 --> 30:45.900
and Mr. Palmer
got on that elevator,

30:45.940 --> 30:49.432
a 20-Tesla magnet
was stolen from a lab
at Rutgers Univer5ity.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.278
On his way out,
the thief crossed
with a security guard

30:52.310 --> 30:54.414
and beat him half to death.

30:54.450 --> 30:56.611
Guy almost bled out.

30:56.650 --> 30:59.118
The thing about blood,
it's almost as good as ink

30:59.150 --> 31:01.118
at taking fingerprints.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.879
The ass_ailant left
a clean impressmn

31:03.930 --> 31:07.184
of his thumb
and three of his fingers.

31:07.230 --> 31:11.564
We were wondering
if they'll be a match for yours.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.194
Now, if you don't want to get
your hands dirty, that's okay.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.061
Shouldn't be hard to pull
any of the dozen or so prints

31:17.100 --> 31:19.034
you've left since
you walked in this room.

31:24.080 --> 31:27.174
I'm not a killer.

31:27.210 --> 31:30.919
If you want to speak to me
again, contact my attorney.

31:37.690 --> 31:39.885
(phone ringing)

31:42.230 --> 31:43.424
Hello.

31:43.460 --> 31:45.098
ELANA:
It's me, Joan. Elana.

31:45.130 --> 31:46.927
A few months ago,
you were kind enough

31:46.970 --> 31:48.164
to take me to lunch.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.589
I was wondering
if I could return the favor.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.505
WATSON:
What do you want, Elana?

31:54.540 --> 31:57.270
You talked to a man
today about a theft.

31:57.310 --> 32:00.108
Obviously, you heard
from Kevin Elspeth.

32:00.150 --> 32:03.244
I'm sorry, that
name's not familiar.

32:03.280 --> 32:06.511
The crime, on
the other hand...

32:06.550 --> 32:10.509
An acquaintance of
mine was the culprit.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.949
A man by the name
of Romero Sosa.

32:12.990 --> 32:14.992
WATSON:
The same Romero Sosa

32:15.030 --> 32:16.497
who used to work
for your husband.

32:16.530 --> 32:18.293
Did he?

32:18.330 --> 32:20.628
Well, in the event that any
fingerprints were taken,

32:20.670 --> 32:22.297
I strongly suggest

32:22.340 --> 32:23.591
that you compare
them to Mr. Sosa's,

32:23.640 --> 32:25.699
not this Mr....
I'm sorry,

32:25.740 --> 32:27.332
what did you say
his name was again?

32:27.370 --> 32:29.975
Elspeth would only
kill Karen Lloyd

32:30.010 --> 32:31.671
if you supplied him
with the right equipment.

32:31.710 --> 32:33.678
Sosa stole the magnet,

32:33.710 --> 32:36.975
Elspeth used it
to pull off the hit.

32:37.020 --> 32:39.341
So the prints we got
from Elspeth today

32:39.390 --> 32:41.608
aren't going to match
the ones from the scene.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.049
I'm just trying
to give you a tip.

32:44.090 --> 32:45.648
Anonymously and
off the record.

32:45.690 --> 32:47.749
Where is
Sosa now?

32:47.790 --> 32:50.452
We've fallen
out of touch.

32:50.500 --> 32:52.024
So you had him killed.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.560
His body's probably at
the bottom of the ocean.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.989
You're so
negative, Joan.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.361
Karen was
negaUve.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.299
Look where
it got her.

33:01.340 --> 33:03.479
I really thought
you'd be there.

33:03.510 --> 33:05.478
With her,
in the end.

33:05.510 --> 33:08.070
In fact,
I'm amazed

33:08.120 --> 33:09.576
you weren't in
that elevator.

33:09.620 --> 33:11.440
I mean...

33:11.490 --> 33:13.617
what if the person behind it

33:13.650 --> 33:16.084
was counting on you being there?

33:19.260 --> 33:21.251
Well, I guess
that person

33:21.300 --> 33:24.565
would've been
pretty disappointed.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.124
I don't think
she's the type

33:26.170 --> 33:28.035
to stay disappointed
for very long.

33:42.380 --> 33:44.018
(doorbell rings)

33:48.460 --> 33:50.189
Housewarming present.

33:51.860 --> 33:55.091
There's little open
at this hour.

33:55.130 --> 33:57.257
What do you want?

33:57.300 --> 33:58.824
Captain Gregson
told me

33:58.870 --> 34:00.428
of your crossing
with Miss March.

34:00.470 --> 34:02.438
She was right, of course.

34:02.470 --> 34:05.166
The fingerprints were not
a match for Kevin Elspeth's.

34:07.470 --> 34:08.630
May I come in?

34:27.860 --> 34:29.418
Kevin Elspeth?

34:29.460 --> 34:32.520
Yes, that's him
checking in.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.663
You said the
electromagnet

34:34.700 --> 34:35.769
was like a keg,

34:35.800 --> 34:36.334
but he didn't have any luggage
that size or shape.

34:36.370 --> 34:38.235
Hmm. Obviously, he...

34:38.270 --> 34:40.261
He brought it in
in pieces, I know.

34:41.340 --> 34:42.876
Well, he'd have to.

34:42.910 --> 34:45.378
A 20-Tesla magnet weighs
a little more than one ton.

34:45.410 --> 34:46.707
A ton?

34:46.750 --> 34:48.172
Romero Sosa

34:48.220 --> 34:50.313
would've needed help
when he stole it.

34:50.350 --> 34:53.615
So Captain Gregson is
dispatching a team to Rutgers

34:53.650 --> 34:54.878
tomorrow
morning.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.558
They'll search
for evidence

34:56.590 --> 34:59.855
which might help identify
additional parties.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.222
You could've sent me a text.

35:02.260 --> 35:03.591
Hmm.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.529
I know what it's like
to be frustrated

35:07.570 --> 35:09.128
in pursuit of a nemesis.

35:11.270 --> 35:13.238
There were times when,
amongst your other functions,

35:13.270 --> 35:14.828
you served as a kind of
"sounding board" for me,

35:14.880 --> 35:16.279
so I thought perhaps I could

35:16.310 --> 35:18.642
return
the favor.
No.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.875
You decided
we weren't partners.

35:20.910 --> 35:22.377
So I learned
to work without you.

35:22.420 --> 35:24.479
It's what I'm used to now.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.183
Well, should you
change your mind...

35:44.470 --> 35:47.462
*

36:14.800 --> 36:16.597
*

36:42.430 --> 36:44.819
*

36:46.970 --> 36:48.961
(birds singing)

36:52.270 --> 36:53.965
I think I'm ready
for another.

36:54.010 --> 36:56.399
It's got to be 5:00
somewhere, right?

37:00.580 --> 37:01.911
Joan.

37:01.950 --> 37:03.975
And you brought
yourfnend.

37:04.020 --> 37:05.544
You have great taste.

37:05.590 --> 37:09.356
Real estate, horses, hit men.

37:09.390 --> 37:11.688
I was so focused
on what happened

37:11.730 --> 37:12.958
in that elevator,

37:12.990 --> 37:14.628
I never stopped to think
about what happened next.

37:14.660 --> 37:16.799
Imagine you're
Kevin Elspeth.

37:16.830 --> 37:19.367
You just killed
two people in cold blood.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.334
Now, police are flooding
into the hotel.

37:21.370 --> 37:22.837
They're checking the rooms,
blocking exits,

37:22.870 --> 37:24.303
and you want out.

37:24.340 --> 37:25.705
Problem is, you have

37:25.740 --> 37:27.833
a 2,000-pound
magnet with you.

37:27.870 --> 37:30.407
Pretty hard to explain.
So what do you do?

37:30.440 --> 37:31.873
Hmm, I don't know.

37:31.910 --> 37:34.049
Can I fly in this
absurd hypothetical?

37:34.080 --> 37:36.514
No, but you're clever.

37:36.550 --> 37:39.018
Clever enough to have smuggled
pieces of your murder weapon

37:39.050 --> 37:41.848
into the hotel in your luggage.

37:41.890 --> 37:44.017
Others you had shipped
there in boxes.

37:44.060 --> 37:45.948
Only now,
the job's done,

37:45.990 --> 37:49.027
but the murder weapon is
too heaw to move quickly.

37:49.060 --> 37:50.948
The hotel lobby cameras

37:51.000 --> 37:52.399
have Elspeth
coming and going.

37:52.430 --> 37:53.988
But the thing is,

37:54.030 --> 37:55.998
his bags look a lot heavier
checking in

37:56.040 --> 37:57.530
than checking out.

37:57.570 --> 37:58.901
We confirmed that he didn't send

37:58.940 --> 38:00.999
any packages from the hotel.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.338
He left the magnet
in his room.

38:03.380 --> 38:05.405
I was planning on
going riding today,

38:05.450 --> 38:08.510
so if you want to talk
more about your theories,

38:08.550 --> 38:10.973
I suggest you consult
my attorneys.

38:11.020 --> 38:12.385
We found it.

38:15.660 --> 38:17.616
There are only
so many places you could

38:17.660 --> 38:19.423
stash something that size.

38:19.460 --> 38:21.826
The bench in the shower
was perfect.

38:21.860 --> 38:24.499
When it was over, all he had
to do was replace the top

38:24.530 --> 38:26.998
of the bench.
He did a good job, too.

38:27.030 --> 38:28.998
But the thing is,

38:29.040 --> 38:31.338
if you really study
every inch of a crime scene,

38:31.370 --> 38:34.009
sometimes you notice things
you weren't even looking for.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.928
Like where
the grout

38:35.980 --> 38:38.448
is a little whiter
because it's new.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.040
_ BELL:
Kevm Elspeth was careful
not to get his prints

38:41.080 --> 38:43.548
on the magnet.
We know, because

38:43.580 --> 38:45.810
he buried disposable gloves--
like these--

38:45.850 --> 38:47.010
right in there
with it.

38:47.050 --> 38:49.018
Now, he didn't consider
the possibility

38:49.060 --> 38:52.382
we could be pull his prints from
inside the gloves themselves.

38:52.430 --> 38:54.421
(door opens)
(indistinct chatter)

38:57.000 --> 38:59.491
And I suppose he told you

38:59.530 --> 39:01.862
exactly what you wanted to hear.

39:01.900 --> 39:05.063
Well, you're under arrest.

39:05.110 --> 39:08.409
I wonder if this...

39:08.440 --> 39:11.034
Mr. Elspeth will
still be alive

39:11.080 --> 39:12.570
by the time
I go to trial.

39:12.610 --> 39:14.942
Well, yes and no.

39:14.980 --> 39:17.642
Kevin Elspeth
doesn't exist anymore.

39:17.680 --> 39:20.649
He entered Federal Witness
Protection this morning.

39:20.690 --> 39:22.954
You're never gonna
find this one, Elana.

39:22.990 --> 39:24.821
BELL:
You have the right
to remain silent

39:24.860 --> 39:26.725
and refuse_
to answer questions.

39:26.760 --> 39:28.421
Anything you do say
may be used against you

39:28.460 --> 39:30.121
in a court of law.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.128
(doorbell rings)
Kitty!

39:37.170 --> 39:38.603
KITTY:
Did you forget
you handcuffed me

39:38.640 --> 39:40.767
to a chair down here?

39:40.810 --> 39:42.801
(quietly):
You should've freed yourself
minutes ago.

39:46.950 --> 39:48.611
Watson.

39:48.650 --> 39:50.140
Can I come in?

39:50.180 --> 39:51.681
Mm.

39:55.190 --> 39:57.158
Place looks good.

39:57.190 --> 39:59.124
Does it?

40:00.790 --> 40:02.451
I wanted to let you know
that, uh...

40:02.500 --> 40:04.821
Elana March has been
brought to justice.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.667
Again. Yeah.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.167
Saw it on the news.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.532
You are to be
commended, Watson.

40:10.570 --> 40:12.128
If not for your doggedness...
I told

40:12.170 --> 40:16.174
Captain Gregson I was okay with
you coming back to the precinct.

40:16.210 --> 40:19.202
I'm even okay with, uh, Kitty.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.844
Well, I'm...

40:21.880 --> 40:23.609
I'm very glad to hear that.

40:23.650 --> 40:25.049
We're still
not partners.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.012
We'll work on
our own cases, of course,

40:27.050 --> 40:29.018
but if you ever
need a consultation

40:29.060 --> 40:30.789
or fresh eyes
on something-- whatever--

40:30.820 --> 40:32.685
I'm-I'm available.

40:32.730 --> 40:35.699
As I am to you.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.162
I wanted to ask you one thing.

40:41.670 --> 40:42.967
Why are you here?

40:43.000 --> 40:44.729
I live here.

40:44.770 --> 40:46.806
No, not the brownstone.

40:46.840 --> 40:48.535
New York.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.639
London didn't work out,
but I know you.

40:50.680 --> 40:53.649
You could've gone anywhere.

40:53.680 --> 40:55.511
So why here?

40:56.780 --> 40:58.213
Isn't it obvious?

41:00.050 --> 41:02.757
I belong here.

41:02.790 --> 41:05.486
As do you.

41:21.010 --> 41:23.001
KITTY:
Watson.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.111
Sherlock told me the news.

41:33.690 --> 41:35.578
I'm grateful.

41:35.620 --> 41:37.679
I think I'm gonna learn a lot.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.722
You're welcome.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.997
You threw away a lot
to take up with Sherlock.

41:49.040 --> 41:52.100
It's made me wonder...

41:52.140 --> 41:53.664
What happened to you?

41:53.710 --> 41:55.701
Why would you take him up
on his offer?

41:58.610 --> 42:01.579
I guess I didn't see it
as throwing anything away.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.212
I saw it as

42:03.250 --> 42:05.582
moving towards something.

42:05.620 --> 42:07.611
What about you?
What happened to you?

42:13.130 --> 42:15.121
Oh, it's like you said,
I suppose.

42:17.300 --> 42:19.291
I'm moving towards something.

42:29.240 --> 42:31.231
(door opens)

42:31.280 --> 42:33.271
(door closes)
