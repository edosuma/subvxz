00:45.342 --> 00:47.674
SAGAN:
<i>The sky calls to us.</i>

00:48.044 --> 00:50.137
<i>If we do not destroy ourselves...</i>

00:50.347 --> 00:53.373
<i>... we will one day venture</i>
<i>to the stars.</i>

00:54.284 --> 00:57.742
<i>There was a time when the stars</i>
<i>seemed an impenetrable mystery.</i>

00:57.954 --> 01:01.287
<i>Today, we have begun</i>
<i>to understand them.</i>

01:01.491 --> 01:06.428
<i>In our personal lives also, we</i>
<i>journey from ignorance to knowledge.</i>

01:06.663 --> 01:11.100
<i>Our individual growth reflects</i>
<i>the advancement of the species.</i>

01:11.601 --> 01:13.535
<i>The exploration of the cosmos is...</i>

01:13.737 --> 01:16.763
<i>... a voyage of self-discovery.</i>

01:27.283 --> 01:30.218
<i>When I was a child, I lived here...</i>

01:30.420 --> 01:34.720
<i>... in the Bensonhurst section of</i>
<i>Brooklyn in the city of New York.</i>

01:34.924 --> 01:37.984
<i>I knew my immediate</i>
<i>neighborhood intimately...</i>

01:38.194 --> 01:42.460
<i>... every candy store, front stoop...</i>

01:42.665 --> 01:44.929
<i>... back yard, empty lot...</i>

01:45.135 --> 01:48.229
<i>... and wall for playing</i>
<i>Chinese handball.</i>

01:53.843 --> 01:55.970
<i>It was my whole world.</i>

02:15.064 --> 02:17.191
<i>But more than a few blocks away...</i>

02:17.400 --> 02:22.099
<i>... north of the raucous traffic</i>
<i>and elevated railway on 86th Street...</i>

02:22.305 --> 02:25.968
<i>... was an unknown territory</i>
<i>off-limits to my wanderings.</i>

02:26.910 --> 02:29.674
<i>It could have been Mars</i>
<i>for all I knew.</i>

02:33.783 --> 02:36.616
Even with an early bedtime
in the winter...

02:36.886 --> 02:39.878
...you could occasionally see
the stars.

02:40.390 --> 02:43.689
I would look up at them
and wonder what they were.

02:43.993 --> 02:46.757
I'd ask other kids and adults...

02:47.330 --> 02:48.922
...and they would answer:

02:49.132 --> 02:51.191
"They're lights in the sky, kid."

02:51.401 --> 02:55.360
Well, I could tell they were lights
in the sky, but what were they?

02:55.572 --> 02:59.008
There had to be some deeper answer.

03:04.414 --> 03:07.906
I remember I was issued
my first library card.

03:08.117 --> 03:12.679
It was some library on 85th Street.
Anyway, it was in alien territory.

03:13.156 --> 03:16.853
And I asked the librarian
for a book on stars.

03:17.293 --> 03:18.726
She gave me...

03:19.162 --> 03:22.097
...a picture book with portraits
of men and women...

03:22.298 --> 03:25.927
...with names like
Veronica Lake and Alan Ladd.

03:26.469 --> 03:29.870
I explained that wasn't what
I wanted at all.

03:30.473 --> 03:33.909
And for some reason,
then obscure to me, she smiled...

03:34.110 --> 03:37.273
...and got me another book,
the right kind of book.

03:37.580 --> 03:39.878
I was so excited to know
the answer...

03:40.083 --> 03:43.143
...I opened the book breathlessly,
right there in the library...

03:43.353 --> 03:46.186
...and the book said
something astonishing...

03:46.389 --> 03:48.880
...a very big thought.

03:49.592 --> 03:52.925
Stars, it said, were suns...

03:53.129 --> 03:54.892
...but very far away.

03:55.098 --> 03:59.034
The sun was a star, but close-up.

04:06.709 --> 04:10.440
<i>How, I wondered, could anybody</i>
<i>know such things for sure?</i>

04:10.647 --> 04:14.174
<i>How did they figure it out?</i>
<i>Where did they even begin?</i>

04:23.726 --> 04:26.695
I was ignorant of the idea
of angular size.

04:26.896 --> 04:30.889
I didn't know about the inverse square
law of the propagation of light.

04:31.100 --> 04:34.900
I didn't have any chance of
calculating the distance to the stars.

04:35.104 --> 04:38.198
But I could tell that if
the stars were suns...

04:38.408 --> 04:40.876
...they had to be awfully far away.

04:41.077 --> 04:45.309
Further away than 86th Street,
further away than Manhattan...

04:45.515 --> 04:48.882
...further away, probably,
than New Jersey.

04:49.085 --> 04:52.782
The universe had become
much grander...

04:52.989 --> 04:55.355
...than I had ever guessed.

04:58.294 --> 05:00.956
And then I read
another astonishing fact.

05:01.164 --> 05:04.463
The Earth, which includes Brooklyn...

05:04.667 --> 05:05.964
...was a planet.

05:06.169 --> 05:08.228
It went around the sun.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.030
There were other planets.

05:10.239 --> 05:12.503
They also went around the sun...

05:12.709 --> 05:16.008
...some closer to the sun,
some further from the sun.

05:16.245 --> 05:20.773
But planets didn't shine by their
own light the way the sun does.

05:21.517 --> 05:25.476
No, planets simply reflected
the little bit of light...

05:25.688 --> 05:29.283
...that shines on them
from the sun back to us.

05:29.492 --> 05:31.756
If you were a great distance
from the sun...

05:31.961 --> 05:35.692
...you wouldn't be able to see
the Earth or the other planets at all.

05:35.932 --> 05:38.628
Well, then, it stood
to reason, I thought...

05:38.835 --> 05:42.464
...that those other stars ought to
have their own planets...

05:42.672 --> 05:44.936
...and some of those planets
ought to have life.

05:45.575 --> 05:46.803
Why not?

05:47.010 --> 05:51.413
And that life ought to be pretty
different from life as we know it...

05:51.614 --> 05:53.605
...life here in Brooklyn.

05:53.816 --> 05:56.944
Ganymede. Look at this
amazing Ganymede stuff.

05:57.153 --> 05:58.211
Wait, wait, wait.

05:58.421 --> 06:00.821
<i>As a child, it was</i>
<i>my immense good fortune...</i>

06:01.024 --> 06:05.051
<i>... to have parents and a few teachers</i>
<i>who encouraged my curiosity.</i>

06:05.261 --> 06:07.593
<i>This was my 6th-grade classroom.</i>

06:07.797 --> 06:10.766
<i>I came back here one day</i>
<i>to remember what it was like.</i>

06:10.967 --> 06:13.697
<i>I brought some of the pictures</i>
<i>of other worlds...</i>

06:13.903 --> 06:16.531
<i>... that were radioed back</i>
<i>by the</i> Voyager <i>spacecraft...</i>

06:16.739 --> 06:18.866
<i>... of Jupiter and its moons.</i>

06:19.075 --> 06:20.633
This is Calisto which is...

06:20.843 --> 06:22.003
(SAGAN LAUGHS)

06:24.380 --> 06:26.314
What is a Calisto?
I want a Calisto.

06:26.516 --> 06:27.813
Now you got it.
What is it?

06:28.017 --> 06:31.509
It's the outermost
big moon of Jupiter.

06:32.588 --> 06:35.022
Who is this guy? Europa.

06:36.426 --> 06:38.053
Another Europa.

06:38.428 --> 06:41.488
A black-and-white picture
of a ring of Jupiter.

06:41.898 --> 06:44.924
There you go.
That's a prize for honesty.

06:45.568 --> 06:47.058
You didn't get a second.

06:47.270 --> 06:48.760
Which one would you like?

07:00.950 --> 07:04.010
<i>Every one of us begins life</i>
<i>with an open mind...</i>

07:04.220 --> 07:08.156
<i>... a driving curiosity,</i>
<i>a sense of wonder.</i>

07:09.258 --> 07:12.591
I thought it might be fun
if we now had some questions.

07:12.795 --> 07:16.697
Why is the Earth round?
Why isn't it square or any other shape?

07:17.400 --> 07:18.992
That's a good question.

07:19.202 --> 07:23.639
That's a question I've asked myself.
The answer has to do with gravity.

07:24.140 --> 07:25.971
The Earth has a strong gravity.

07:26.175 --> 07:28.735
If you were to make a mountain
very high...

07:28.945 --> 07:31.846
...higher than Everest,
the biggest mountain on Earth...

07:32.048 --> 07:34.380
...it would be crushed
by its own weight.

07:34.584 --> 07:37.246
Gravity pulls everything
towards the center.

07:37.453 --> 07:40.718
So any really big bump
on the Earth is crushed.

07:40.923 --> 07:44.552
But if you had a small object,
a tiny world...

07:44.761 --> 07:46.422
...the gravity is very low...

07:46.629 --> 07:49.792
...and then it can be very different
from a sphere.

07:49.999 --> 07:54.402
I think I have here
a world that isn't a sphere.

07:54.771 --> 07:55.829
Here.

07:57.039 --> 07:58.370
Look at this one.

07:59.575 --> 08:01.065
See? It's lumpy.

08:02.845 --> 08:04.039
It's a lumpy world.

08:05.114 --> 08:06.479
It looks like a potato.

08:07.216 --> 08:10.379
There's a large potato
orbiting the planet Mars.

08:10.586 --> 08:12.816
This is one of the moons of Mars.

08:13.022 --> 08:15.252
That's a perfect example.

08:15.458 --> 08:19.451
You can have big departures from
a sphere if your gravity is low.

08:19.662 --> 08:21.562
Now the question in the front.

08:21.764 --> 08:24.995
Is the sun considered part
of the Milky Way galaxy?

08:25.201 --> 08:28.329
Sure, you're considered part
of the Milky Way galaxy.

08:28.771 --> 08:33.071
Everything except other galaxies is
part of the Milky Way galaxy.

08:33.276 --> 08:34.834
The sun is one star.

08:35.044 --> 08:39.981
There is a few hundred billion stars
in the Milky Way.

08:40.283 --> 08:43.013
Around each star, maybe,
is a whole bunch of planets.

08:43.886 --> 08:47.117
And on one of those planets is life...

08:47.323 --> 08:51.191
...and one of the life forms
on that planet is you.

08:51.394 --> 08:53.760
You're a part of
the Milky Way galaxy too.

09:04.240 --> 09:09.177
<i>Sometimes I think, how lucky we are</i>
<i>to live in this time...</i>

09:09.378 --> 09:13.041
<i>... the first moment in human history</i>
<i>when we are, in fact...</i>

09:13.249 --> 09:14.841
<i>... visiting other worlds...</i>

09:15.051 --> 09:19.283
<i>... and engaging in a deep</i>
<i>reconnaissance of the cosmos.</i>

09:19.655 --> 09:22.283
<i>But if we had been born</i>
<i>in a much earlier age...</i>

09:22.491 --> 09:25.585
<i>... no matter how great our dedication,</i>
<i>we couldn't have understood...</i>

09:25.795 --> 09:28.059
<i>... what the stars and planets are.</i>

09:37.607 --> 09:42.101
<i>We would not have known that there</i>
<i>were other suns and other worlds.</i>

09:45.448 --> 09:49.407
<i>This is one of the great secrets</i>
<i>wrested from nature...</i>

09:49.619 --> 09:54.079
<i>... through a million years of patient</i>
<i>observation and courageous thinking.</i>

09:57.560 --> 10:01.360
Human beings have always asked
questions about the stars.

10:01.564 --> 10:04.624
It's as natural as breathing.

10:04.867 --> 10:08.701
But imagine a time before science
had found out the answers.

10:08.905 --> 10:11.499
Imagine what it was like, say...

10:11.707 --> 10:15.234
...hundreds of thousands
of years ago...

10:15.444 --> 10:19.039
...soon after the discovery of fire.

10:19.248 --> 10:22.843
We were just as smart
and just as curious then...

10:23.052 --> 10:24.713
...as we are now.

10:24.921 --> 10:26.786
Sometimes it seems to me that...

10:26.989 --> 10:30.015
...there were people then
who thought like this:

10:32.395 --> 10:35.956
<i>We are wandering hunter folk.</i>

10:36.165 --> 10:37.826
<i>Fire keeps us warm.</i>

10:38.034 --> 10:41.265
<i>Its light makes holes in the darkness.</i>

10:41.470 --> 10:43.734
<i>It keeps hungry animals away.</i>

10:44.173 --> 10:47.665
<i>In the darkness,</i>
<i>we can see each other and talk.</i>

10:48.844 --> 10:50.835
<i>We take care of the flame.</i>

10:51.047 --> 10:54.039
<i>The flame takes care of us.</i>

10:54.951 --> 10:57.249
<i>The stars are not near to us.</i>

10:57.453 --> 11:01.150
<i>When we climb a hill or a tree,</i>
<i>they are no closer.</i>

11:01.357 --> 11:05.293
<i>They flicker with</i>
<i>a strange, cold, white...</i>

11:06.095 --> 11:07.153
<i>... faraway light.</i>

11:08.097 --> 11:12.397
<i>Many of them, all over the sky,</i>
<i>but only at night.</i>

11:12.768 --> 11:14.861
<i>I wonder what they are.</i>

11:15.671 --> 11:19.198
<i>One night I thought</i>
<i>the stars are flames.</i>

11:19.408 --> 11:22.605
<i>They give a little light</i>
<i>at night as fire does.</i>

11:22.812 --> 11:24.871
<i>Maybe the stars are campfires...</i>

11:25.081 --> 11:28.244
<i>... which other wanderers</i>
<i>light at night.</i>

11:28.951 --> 11:32.284
<i>The stars give a much</i>
<i>smaller light than campfires...</i>

11:32.488 --> 11:35.286
<i>... so they must be very far away.</i>

11:35.858 --> 11:38.520
<i>I wonder if our campfires...</i>

11:38.728 --> 11:41.492
<i>... look like stars to the people</i>
<i>in the sky.</i>

11:41.897 --> 11:46.391
<i>But why don't those campfires</i>
<i>and the wanderers who made them...</i>

11:46.602 --> 11:48.433
<i>... fall down at our feet?</i>

11:48.637 --> 11:52.835
<i>Why don't strange tribes</i>
<i>drop from the sky?</i>

11:54.643 --> 11:59.410
<i>Those beings in the sky</i>
<i>must have great powers.</i>

12:06.422 --> 12:09.050
I don't suppose
that every hunter-gatherer...

12:09.258 --> 12:11.988
...had such thoughts about the stars.

12:12.194 --> 12:15.630
But we know from contemporary
hunter-gatherer communities...

12:15.831 --> 12:19.562
...that very imaginative ideas arise.

12:20.002 --> 12:22.527
The Kung Bushmen...

12:22.738 --> 12:25.798
...of the Kalahari Desert
in the Republic of Botswana...

12:26.008 --> 12:28.738
...have an explanation
of the Milky Way.

12:28.944 --> 12:31.913
At their latitude,
it's often overhead.

12:32.114 --> 12:36.141
They call it the "backbone of night."

12:36.352 --> 12:38.980
They believe it holds the sky up.

12:39.188 --> 12:41.520
They believe that if not
for the Milky Way...

12:41.724 --> 12:45.353
...pieces of sky would come crashing
down at our feet.

12:45.561 --> 12:49.190
So the Milky Way, in their view,
has some practical value.

12:49.398 --> 12:51.923
The backbone of night.

12:54.770 --> 12:57.466
Later on, metaphors about...

12:57.740 --> 13:00.231
...campfires or backbones...

13:00.443 --> 13:03.742
...or holes through which
the flame could be seen...

13:03.946 --> 13:08.315
...were replaced in most human
communities by another idea.

13:08.784 --> 13:13.653
The powerful beings in the sky
were promoted to gods.

13:14.290 --> 13:17.384
They were given names and relatives...

13:17.593 --> 13:19.527
...and special responsibilities...

13:19.728 --> 13:23.095
...for the cosmic services they were
expected to perform.

13:23.299 --> 13:27.167
There was a god
for every human concern.

13:27.369 --> 13:28.427
Gods ran nature.

13:28.637 --> 13:33.074
Nothing happened without the direct
intervention of some god.

13:33.375 --> 13:36.833
If the gods were happy,
there was plenty of food...

13:37.046 --> 13:38.604
...and humans were happy.

13:40.416 --> 13:43.180
But if something
displeased the gods...

13:43.385 --> 13:47.685
...and it didn't take much,
the consequences were awesome:

13:47.890 --> 13:51.121
Droughts, floods, storms, wars...

13:51.327 --> 13:54.956
...earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
epidemics.

13:55.865 --> 13:58.891
The gods had to be propitiated.

13:59.101 --> 14:01.763
And a vast industry
of priests arose...

14:01.971 --> 14:04.496
...to make the gods less angry.

14:05.107 --> 14:08.167
But because the gods
were capricious...

14:08.377 --> 14:10.868
...you couldn't be sure
what they would do.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.514
Nature was a mystery.

14:13.782 --> 14:16.307
It was hard to understand the world.

14:19.355 --> 14:22.518
<i>Our ancestors groped in darkness...</i>

14:22.725 --> 14:25.023
<i>... to make sense</i>
<i>of their surroundings.</i>

14:25.227 --> 14:26.717
<i>Powerless before nature...</i>

14:27.396 --> 14:29.956
<i>... they invented rituals and myths...</i>

14:30.166 --> 14:32.726
<i>... some desperate and cruel...</i>

14:32.935 --> 14:36.598
<i>... others imaginative and benign.</i>

14:36.939 --> 14:39.169
<i>The ancient Greeks explained...</i>

14:39.375 --> 14:42.833
<i>... that diffuse band of brightness</i>
<i>in the night sky...</i>

14:43.045 --> 14:45.707
<i>... as the milk of the goddess Hera...</i>

14:45.915 --> 14:48.884
<i>... squirted from her breast</i>
<i>across the heavens.</i>

14:49.084 --> 14:52.520
<i>We still call it the Milky Way.</i>

14:59.028 --> 15:02.020
<i>In gratitude for the many gifts</i>
<i>of the gods...</i>

15:02.231 --> 15:06.361
<i>... our ancestors created works</i>
<i>of surpassing beauty.</i>

15:09.305 --> 15:11.796
<i>This is all that remains...</i>

15:12.007 --> 15:15.408
<i>... of the ancient temple of Hera,</i>
<i>queen of heaven:</i>

15:15.778 --> 15:20.647
<i>A single marble column standing</i>
<i>in a vast field of ruins...</i>

15:21.350 --> 15:23.341
<i>... on the Greek island of Samos.</i>

15:23.552 --> 15:25.520
<i>It was one of the wonders</i>
<i>of the world...</i>

15:25.988 --> 15:30.448
<i>... built by people with</i>
<i>an extraordinary eye for clarity...</i>

15:30.659 --> 15:32.217
<i>... and symmetry.</i>

15:39.602 --> 15:41.934
<i>Those who thronged to that temple...</i>

15:42.137 --> 15:44.731
<i>... were also the architects</i>
<i>of a bridge...</i>

15:44.940 --> 15:47.738
<i>... from their world to ours.</i>

15:50.346 --> 15:54.840
<i>We were moving once again</i>
<i>in our voyage of self-discovery...</i>

15:55.117 --> 15:57.745
<i>... on our journey to the stars.</i>

16:02.691 --> 16:06.388
Here, 25 centuries ago...

16:07.029 --> 16:10.396
...on the island of Samos
and in the other Greek colonies...

16:10.599 --> 16:13.159
...which had grown up
in the busy Aegean Sea...

16:13.369 --> 16:15.963
...there was a glorious awakening.

16:16.171 --> 16:19.732
Suddenly, people believed
that everything was made of atoms...

16:19.942 --> 16:24.208
...that human beings and other animals
had evolved from simpler forms...

16:24.413 --> 16:29.043
...that diseases were not caused by
demons or the gods...

16:29.251 --> 16:33.551
...that the Earth was only
a planet going around a sun...

16:33.756 --> 16:36.122
...which was very far away.

16:39.695 --> 16:43.791
This revolution made cosmos
out of chaos.

16:44.199 --> 16:47.532
Here, in the sixth century B.C.,
a new idea developed...

16:47.736 --> 16:50.398
...one of the great ideas
of the human species.

16:50.606 --> 16:54.667
It was argued that the universe
was knowable.

16:54.977 --> 16:57.639
<i>Why? Because it was ordered.</i>

16:57.846 --> 17:00.406
<i>Because there are regularities</i>
<i>in nature...</i>

17:00.616 --> 17:03.449
<i>... which permitted secrets</i>
<i>to be uncovered.</i>

17:05.688 --> 17:09.089
<i>Nature was not entirely unpredictable.</i>

17:09.291 --> 17:13.022
<i>There were rules which even</i>
<i>she had to obey.</i>

17:15.564 --> 17:20.228
This ordered and admirable character
of the universe...

17:20.436 --> 17:22.427
...was called cosmos.

17:23.605 --> 17:26.335
And it was set
in stark contradiction...

17:26.542 --> 17:28.772
...to the idea of chaos.

17:29.645 --> 17:33.911
This was the first conflict
of which we know...

17:34.350 --> 17:36.580
...between science and mysticism...

17:37.386 --> 17:40.116
...between nature and the gods.

17:45.928 --> 17:47.896
But why here?

17:48.497 --> 17:52.934
Why in these remote islands and inlets
of the eastern Mediterranean?

17:53.135 --> 17:55.433
Why not in the great cities of...

17:55.637 --> 18:00.301
...India or Egypt, Babylon,
China, Mesoamerica?

18:02.978 --> 18:06.277
<i>Because they were all</i>
<i>at the center of old empires.</i>

18:08.851 --> 18:12.378
<i>They were set in their ways,</i>
<i>hostile to new ideas.</i>

18:12.588 --> 18:14.351
<i>But here in lonia...</i>

18:14.556 --> 18:18.458
<i>... were a multitude of newly colonized</i>
<i>islands and city-states.</i>

18:18.660 --> 18:22.994
<i>Isolation, even if incomplete,</i>
<i>promotes diversity.</i>

18:23.198 --> 18:27.362
<i>No single concentration of power</i>
<i>could enforce conformity.</i>

18:27.569 --> 18:30.504
<i>Free inquiry became possible.</i>

18:31.407 --> 18:34.740
<i>They were beyond the frontiers</i>
<i>of the empires.</i>

18:34.943 --> 18:38.435
<i>The merchants and tourists</i>
<i>and sailors of Africa...</i>

18:38.647 --> 18:41.707
<i>... Asia and Europe</i>
<i>met in the harbors of lonia...</i>

18:42.584 --> 18:46.384
<i>... to exchange goods</i>
<i>and stories and ideas.</i>

18:46.588 --> 18:49.853
<i>There was a vigorous and heady</i>
<i>interaction...</i>

18:50.058 --> 18:54.859
<i>... of many traditions, prejudices,</i>
<i>languages and gods.</i>

19:04.706 --> 19:08.107
<i>These people were ready to experiment.</i>

19:08.677 --> 19:11.771
<i>Once you are open to</i>
<i>questioning rituals...</i>

19:11.980 --> 19:13.948
<i>... and time-honored practices...</i>

19:14.149 --> 19:18.552
<i>... you find that one question</i>
<i>leads to another.</i>

19:28.263 --> 19:31.391
What do you do when you're faced
with several different gods...

19:31.600 --> 19:34.000
...each claiming the same territory?

19:34.203 --> 19:36.763
The Babylonian Marduk
and the Greek Zeus...

19:36.972 --> 19:40.430
...were each considered
king of the gods...

19:40.642 --> 19:42.576
...master of the sky.

19:43.045 --> 19:46.412
You might decide, since they otherwise
had different attributes...

19:46.615 --> 19:49.379
...that one of them was merely
invented by the priests.

19:49.585 --> 19:52.247
But if one, why not both?

19:58.026 --> 20:01.052
<i>And so it was here</i>
<i>that the great idea arose:</i>

20:01.263 --> 20:03.288
<i>The realization that there</i>
<i>might be a way...</i>

20:03.499 --> 20:06.093
<i>... to know the world</i>
<i>without the god hypothesis.</i>

20:06.301 --> 20:11.068
That there be principles,
forces, laws of nature...

20:11.273 --> 20:14.765
...through which the world might be
understood without attributing...

20:14.977 --> 20:19.038
...the fall of every sparrow to
the direct intervention of Zeus.

20:19.448 --> 20:22.645
This is the place
where science was born.

20:23.018 --> 20:24.849
That's why we're here.

20:26.388 --> 20:31.325
<i>This Greek revolution happened</i>
<i>between 600 and 400 B.C.</i>

20:31.994 --> 20:35.157
<i>It was accomplished by the same</i>
<i>practical and productive people...</i>

20:35.364 --> 20:37.195
<i>... who made the society function.</i>

20:37.399 --> 20:40.493
<i>Political power was in the hands</i>
<i>of the merchants...</i>

20:40.702 --> 20:43.933
<i>... who promoted the technology</i>
<i>on which their prosperity depended.</i>

20:44.339 --> 20:46.500
<i>The earliest pioneers</i>
<i>of science were...</i>

20:46.708 --> 20:49.871
<i>... merchants and artisans</i>
<i>and their children.</i>

20:56.051 --> 20:59.452
<i>The first Ionian scientist was</i>
<i>named Thales.</i>

20:59.922 --> 21:02.686
He was born over there
in the city of Miletus...

21:02.891 --> 21:05.189
...across this narrow strait.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.157
He had traveled in Egypt...

21:07.362 --> 21:10.195
...and was conversant
with the knowledge of Babylon.

21:10.632 --> 21:15.126
Like the Babylonians, he believed
that the world had once all been water.

21:15.771 --> 21:17.864
To explain the dry land...

21:18.073 --> 21:21.236
...the Babylonians added
that their god, Marduk...

21:21.443 --> 21:25.038
...had placed a mat on the face
of the waters...

21:25.247 --> 21:27.545
...and piled dirt on top of it.

21:29.051 --> 21:30.746
Thales had a similar view...

21:30.953 --> 21:33.854
...but he left Marduk out.

21:34.656 --> 21:37.955
Yes, the world had once been
mostly water...

21:38.460 --> 21:42.988
...but it was a natural process
which explained the dry land.

21:43.198 --> 21:47.430
Thales thought it was similar to
the silting up he had observed...

21:47.636 --> 21:50.127
...at the delta of the river Nile.

21:51.373 --> 21:55.036
Whether Thales' conclusions
were right or wrong...

21:55.243 --> 21:58.701
...is not nearly as important
as his approach.

21:58.914 --> 22:02.441
The world was not made by the gods...

22:02.651 --> 22:05.814
...but instead was the result
of material forces...

22:06.021 --> 22:07.921
...interacting in nature.

22:08.523 --> 22:12.357
Thales brought back from
Babylon and Egypt...

22:12.561 --> 22:15.792
...the seeds of new sciences:

22:16.031 --> 22:18.431
Astronomy and geometry...

22:18.634 --> 22:21.432
...sciences which would
sprout and grow...

22:21.637 --> 22:24.663
...in the fertile soil of Ionia.

22:26.241 --> 22:30.143
Anaximander of Miletus, over there...

22:30.579 --> 22:32.843
...was a friend and colleague
of Thales...

22:33.048 --> 22:35.209
...one of the first people
that we know of...

22:35.417 --> 22:37.647
...to have actually done
an experiment.

22:37.853 --> 22:42.381
By examining the moving shadow
cast by a vertical stick...

22:42.591 --> 22:47.119
...he determined accurately
the lengths of the year and seasons.

22:47.329 --> 22:50.560
For ages, men had used sticks...

22:50.766 --> 22:52.825
...to club and spear each other.

22:53.035 --> 22:56.562
Anaximander used a stick
to measure time.

23:01.043 --> 23:05.639
In 540 B.C., or thereabouts,
on this island of Samos...

23:05.847 --> 23:10.375
...there came to power a tyrant
named Polycrates.

23:10.652 --> 23:12.677
He seems to have started
as a caterer...

23:12.888 --> 23:15.789
...and then went on to
international piracy.

23:16.124 --> 23:20.652
His loot was unloaded
on this very breakwater.

23:20.862 --> 23:23.353
(DRUM BEATS)

23:29.237 --> 23:33.298
<i>But he oppressed his own people,</i>
<i>he made war on his neighbors.</i>

23:33.508 --> 23:35.635
<i>He quite rightly feared invasion.</i>

23:35.844 --> 23:40.747
So Polycrates surrounded his capital
city with an impressive wall...

23:40.949 --> 23:43.884
...whose remains stand till this day.

23:53.295 --> 23:57.254
<i>To carry water from a distant spring</i>
<i>through the fortifications...</i>

23:57.466 --> 24:00.264
<i>... he ordered this great tunnel built.</i>

24:00.469 --> 24:03.961
<i>A kilometer long,</i>
<i>it pierces a mountain.</i>

24:04.239 --> 24:06.571
<i>Two cuttings were dug</i>
<i>from either side...</i>

24:06.775 --> 24:09.039
<i>... which met almost perfectly</i>
<i>in the middle.</i>

24:09.244 --> 24:12.475
<i>The project took some 15 years</i>
<i>to complete.</i>

24:13.415 --> 24:16.976
<i>It is a token of the civil engineering</i>
<i>of its day...</i>

24:17.185 --> 24:21.019
<i>... and an indication of the</i>
<i>extraordinary practical capability...</i>

24:21.223 --> 24:22.121
<i>... of the lonians.</i>

24:25.427 --> 24:27.725
<i>The enduring legacy of the lonians...</i>

24:27.929 --> 24:30.363
<i>... is the tools and techniques</i>
<i>they developed...</i>

24:30.565 --> 24:33.830
<i>... which remain the basis</i>
<i>of modern technology.</i>

24:38.006 --> 24:41.237
This was the time of Theodorus...

24:41.443 --> 24:44.173
...the master engineer of the age...

24:44.379 --> 24:48.372
...a man who is credited with
the invention of...

24:48.583 --> 24:52.542
...the key, the ruler,
the carpenter's square...

24:52.754 --> 24:55.621
...the level, the lathe,
bronze casting.

24:56.124 --> 24:59.093
Why are there no monuments
to this man?

25:00.095 --> 25:03.587
Those who dreamt and speculated...

25:03.799 --> 25:06.199
...and deduced about
the laws of nature...

25:06.401 --> 25:08.869
...talked to the engineers
and the technologists.

25:09.070 --> 25:11.095
They were often the same people.

25:11.473 --> 25:15.432
The practical and the theoretical
were one.

25:16.478 --> 25:21.415
(DRUM BEATS)

25:22.284 --> 25:25.947
<i>This new hybrid of abstract thought...</i>

25:26.154 --> 25:29.555
<i>... and everyday experience</i>
<i>blossomed into science.</i>

25:30.926 --> 25:35.056
<i>When these practical men turned</i>
<i>their attention to the natural world...</i>

25:35.263 --> 25:37.390
<i>... they began to uncover</i>
<i>hidden wonders...</i>

25:38.366 --> 25:40.926
<i>... and breathtaking possibilities.</i>

25:41.570 --> 25:45.028
<i>Anaximander studied the profusion</i>
<i>of living things...</i>

25:45.240 --> 25:47.765
<i>... and saw their interrelationships.</i>

25:47.976 --> 25:52.106
<i>He concluded that life had originated</i>
<i>in water and mud...</i>

25:52.581 --> 25:55.311
<i>... and then colonized the dry land.</i>

25:56.151 --> 25:57.982
<i>"Human beings," he said...</i>

25:58.186 --> 26:01.087
<i>"...must have evolved</i>
<i>from simpler forms."</i>

26:01.590 --> 26:06.527
<i>This insight had to wait 24 centuries</i>
<i>until its truth was demonstrated...</i>

26:07.128 --> 26:08.891
<i>... by Charles Darwin.</i>

26:17.505 --> 26:21.703
<i>Nothing was excluded from the</i>
<i>investigations of the first scientists.</i>

26:21.910 --> 26:26.210
<i>Even the air became the subject</i>
<i>of close examination...</i>

26:26.414 --> 26:30.407
<i>... by a Greek from Sicily</i>
<i>named Empedocles.</i>

26:32.053 --> 26:34.613
He made an astonishing discovery...

26:34.823 --> 26:39.260
...with a household implement
that people had used for centuries.

26:39.594 --> 26:42.757
This is the so-called
water thief.

26:42.964 --> 26:47.162
It's a brazen sphere with a neck
and a hole at the top...

26:47.369 --> 26:49.929
...and a set of little holes
at the bottom.

26:50.138 --> 26:51.799
It was used as a kitchen ladle.

26:52.340 --> 26:56.037
You fill it by immersing it in water.

26:58.546 --> 27:00.844
If, after it's been in there
a little bit...

27:01.049 --> 27:04.212
...you pull it out
with the neck uncovered...

27:05.487 --> 27:09.287
...then the water trickles out
the little holes making a small shower.

27:10.425 --> 27:14.054
Instead, if you pull it out
with the neck covered...

27:14.829 --> 27:16.456
...the water is retained.

27:28.276 --> 27:30.369
Now try to fill it...

27:30.612 --> 27:34.070
...with the neck covered
with my thumb.

27:38.186 --> 27:39.312
Nothing happens.

27:40.188 --> 27:41.314
Why not?

27:41.890 --> 27:43.687
There's something in the way.

27:43.892 --> 27:48.829
Some material is blocking the access
of the water into the sphere.

27:49.164 --> 27:51.359
I can't see any such material.

27:52.233 --> 27:53.860
What could it be?

27:54.602 --> 27:57.093
Empedocles identified it...

27:57.305 --> 27:58.704
...as air.

27:59.341 --> 28:01.104
What else could it be?

28:01.476 --> 28:04.604
A thing you can't see
can exert pressure...

28:04.813 --> 28:08.613
...can frustrate my wish to fill
this vessel with water...

28:08.817 --> 28:13.083
...if I were dumb enough to
leave my thumb on the neck.

28:13.922 --> 28:17.585
Empedocles had discovered...

28:18.927 --> 28:20.417
...the invisible.

28:21.029 --> 28:24.021
Air, he thought, must be matter...

28:24.232 --> 28:27.599
...in a form so finely divided...

28:28.470 --> 28:29.835
...that it couldn't be seen.

28:31.306 --> 28:35.709
<i>This hint, this whiff</i>
<i>of the existence of atoms...</i>

28:35.910 --> 28:40.279
<i>... was carried much further by</i>
<i>a contemporary named Democritus.</i>

28:40.749 --> 28:45.015
<i>Of all the ancient scientists, it is</i>
<i>he who speaks most clearly to us...</i>

28:45.220 --> 28:46.744
<i>... across the centuries.</i>

28:46.955 --> 28:50.186
<i>The few surviving fragments</i>
<i>of his scientific writings...</i>

28:50.392 --> 28:54.021
<i>... reveal a mind of the highest</i>
<i>logical and intuitive powers.</i>

28:54.229 --> 28:59.030
<i>He believed that a large number of</i>
<i>other worlds wander through space...</i>

28:59.234 --> 29:01.532
<i>... that worlds are born and die...</i>

29:01.736 --> 29:03.727
<i>... that some are</i>
<i>rich and living creatures...</i>

29:03.938 --> 29:07.169
<i>... and others are dry and barren.</i>

29:08.543 --> 29:11.376
<i>He was the first to understand</i>
<i>that the Milky Way...</i>

29:11.579 --> 29:15.174
<i>... is an aggregate of the light</i>
<i>of innumerable faint stars.</i>

29:15.383 --> 29:19.251
<i>Beyond campfires in the sky,</i>
<i>beyond the milk of Hera...</i>

29:19.454 --> 29:24.391
<i>... beyond the backbone of night,</i>
<i>the mind of Democritus soared.</i>

29:29.664 --> 29:32.895
<i>He saw deep connections between</i>
<i>the heavens and the Earth.</i>

29:33.501 --> 29:36.436
<i>"Man," he said, "is a microcosm...</i>

29:36.871 --> 29:38.463
<i>... a little cosmos."</i>

30:02.297 --> 30:06.233
<i>Democritus came from</i>
<i>the Ionian town of Abdera...</i>

30:06.434 --> 30:08.732
<i>... on the northern Aegean shore.</i>

30:12.073 --> 30:16.407
<i>In those days, Abdera was</i>
<i>the butt of jokes.</i>

30:17.312 --> 30:19.405
<i>If, around the year 400 B. C...</i>

30:19.614 --> 30:22.082
<i>... in the equivalent</i>
<i>of a restaurant like this...</i>

30:22.650 --> 30:25.278
<i>... you told a story about</i>
<i>someone from Abdera...</i>

30:25.487 --> 30:27.421
<i>... you were guaranteed a laugh.</i>

30:30.291 --> 30:32.259
<i>It was, in a way...</i>

30:32.460 --> 30:34.860
<i>... the Brooklyn of its time.</i>

30:37.365 --> 30:41.563
For Democritus, all of life was to be
enjoyed and understood.

30:41.769 --> 30:44.067
For him, understanding and enjoyment...

30:44.272 --> 30:46.570
...were pretty much the same thing.

30:46.774 --> 30:51.404
He said, "A life without festivity is
a long road without an inn."

30:51.613 --> 30:55.310
Democritus may have come from Abdera,
but he was no dummy.

30:59.120 --> 31:02.112
<i>Democritus understood</i>
<i>that the complex forms...</i>

31:02.323 --> 31:05.724
<i>... changes and motions</i>
<i>of the material world...</i>

31:05.927 --> 31:10.489
<i>... all derived from the interaction</i>
<i>of very simple moving parts.</i>

31:10.698 --> 31:13.394
<i>He called these parts atoms.</i>

31:18.373 --> 31:22.070
<i>All material objects are</i>
<i>collections of atoms...</i>

31:22.610 --> 31:24.043
<i>... intricately assembled...</i>

31:24.245 --> 31:25.542
...even we.

31:25.780 --> 31:28.044
When I cut this apple...

31:28.316 --> 31:30.341
...the knife must be
passing through...

31:30.618 --> 31:34.110
...empty spaces between the atoms,
Democritus argued.

31:34.322 --> 31:37.758
If there were no such empty spaces,
no void...

31:37.959 --> 31:42.521
...then the knife would encounter
some impenetrable atom...

31:42.730 --> 31:44.664
...and the apple wouldn't be cut.

31:44.866 --> 31:47.960
Let's compare the cross sections
of the two pieces.

31:48.169 --> 31:50.763
Are the exposed areas exactly equal?

31:50.972 --> 31:53.702
No, said Democritus,
the curvature of the apple...

31:53.908 --> 31:58.709
...forces this slice to be slightly
shorter than the rest of the apple.

31:59.113 --> 32:02.480
If they were equally tall,
then we'd have...

32:02.684 --> 32:04.743
...a cylinder and not an apple.

32:04.986 --> 32:07.113
No matter how sharp the knife...

32:07.322 --> 32:10.189
...these two pieces have
unequal cross sections.

32:10.391 --> 32:11.756
But why?

32:11.960 --> 32:14.986
Because on the scale
of the very small...

32:15.196 --> 32:18.461
...matter exhibits some
irreducible roughness...

32:18.666 --> 32:22.397
...and this fine scale of roughness
Democritus of Abdera identified...

32:22.670 --> 32:24.604
...with the world of the atoms.

32:24.806 --> 32:26.967
His arguments are not those
we use today.

32:27.175 --> 32:31.475
But they're elegant and subtle
and derived from everyday experience.

32:31.679 --> 32:35.115
And his conclusions were
fundamentally right.

32:40.388 --> 32:43.482
<i>Democritus believed that nothing</i>
<i>happens at random...</i>

32:43.691 --> 32:46.956
<i>... that everything has</i>
<i>a material cause.</i>

32:48.296 --> 32:52.232
He said, "I would rather understand
one cause...

32:52.433 --> 32:54.697
...than be king of Persia."

32:54.902 --> 32:58.133
He believed that poverty
in a democracy was far better...

32:58.339 --> 32:59.966
...than wealth in a tyranny.

33:00.174 --> 33:03.666
He believed that the prevailing
religions of his time were evil...

33:03.878 --> 33:07.905
...and that neither souls
nor immortal gods existed.

33:08.516 --> 33:13.453
There is no evidence that Democritus
was persecuted for his beliefs.

33:14.022 --> 33:17.014
But then again, he came from Abdera.

33:19.294 --> 33:20.625
<i>However, in his time...</i>

33:20.828 --> 33:24.264
<i>... the brief tradition of tolerance</i>
<i>for unconventional views...</i>

33:24.465 --> 33:26.433
<i>... was beginning to erode.</i>

33:26.934 --> 33:29.459
<i>For instance,</i>
<i>the prevailing belief was...</i>

33:29.671 --> 33:32.435
...that the moon and the sun
were gods.

33:33.074 --> 33:36.840
Another contemporary of Democritus,
named Anaxagoras, taught...

33:37.045 --> 33:40.811
...that the moon was a place
made of ordinary matter...

33:41.015 --> 33:45.247
...and that the sun was a red-hot stone
far away in the sky.

33:45.486 --> 33:48.580
For this, Anaxagoras was condemned...

33:48.790 --> 33:52.385
...convicted and imprisoned
for impiety...

33:52.593 --> 33:54.356
...a religious crime.

33:54.562 --> 33:58.157
People began to be persecuted
for their ideas.

33:58.466 --> 34:01.128
A portrait of Democritus is now...

34:01.336 --> 34:04.032
...on the Greek 100-drachma note.

34:04.906 --> 34:07.067
But his ideas were suppressed...

34:07.275 --> 34:09.470
...and his influence on history
made minor.

34:09.677 --> 34:12.373
The mystics were beginning to win.

34:12.580 --> 34:16.710
(DRUM BEATS)

34:19.187 --> 34:21.781
<i>You see, Ionia was also the home...</i>

34:21.989 --> 34:24.822
<i>... of another quite different</i>
<i>intellectual tradition.</i>

34:25.026 --> 34:27.654
<i>Its founder was Pythagoras...</i>

34:27.862 --> 34:31.263
<i>... who lived here on Samos</i>
<i>in the 6th century B.C.</i>

34:32.467 --> 34:34.765
According to local legend...

34:34.969 --> 34:38.530
...this cave was once his abode.

34:38.873 --> 34:41.398
Maybe that was once his living room.

34:41.609 --> 34:43.577
Many centuries later...

34:43.845 --> 34:47.611
...this small Greek Orthodox shrine
was erected on his front porch.

34:47.815 --> 34:52.752
There's a continuity of tradition
from Pythagoras to Christianity.

34:52.987 --> 34:56.650
Pythagoras was the first person
in the history of the world...

34:56.858 --> 34:59.986
...to decide that the Earth
was a sphere.

35:00.228 --> 35:04.426
Perhaps he argued by analogy
with the moon or the sun...

35:04.632 --> 35:07.658
...maybe he noticed the curved shadow
of the Earth on the moon...

35:07.869 --> 35:09.461
...during a lunar eclipse.

35:09.670 --> 35:12.468
Or maybe he recognized
that when ships leave Samos...

35:12.673 --> 35:15.107
...their masts disappear last.

35:20.381 --> 35:23.873
<i>Pythagoras believed that</i>
<i>a mathematical harmony...</i>

35:24.085 --> 35:25.950
<i>... underlies all of nature.</i>

35:26.154 --> 35:28.418
<i>The modern tradition</i>
<i>of mathematical argument...</i>

35:28.623 --> 35:31.990
<i>... essential in all of science</i>
<i>owes much to him.</i>

35:32.193 --> 35:35.959
<i>And the notion that the heavenly bodies</i>
<i>move to a kind of...</i>

35:36.164 --> 35:38.394
<i>... music of the spheres...</i>

35:38.699 --> 35:41.224
<i>... was also derived from Pythagoras.</i>

35:41.836 --> 35:44.703
<i>It was he who first used</i>
<i>the word cosmos...</i>

35:44.906 --> 35:47.739
<i>... to mean a well-ordered</i>
<i>and harmonious universe...</i>

35:47.942 --> 35:51.434
<i>... a world amenable</i>
<i>to human understanding.</i>

35:55.817 --> 35:59.253
For this great idea,
we are indebted to Pythagoras.

35:59.454 --> 36:03.982
But there were deep ironies
and contradictions in his thoughts.

36:04.459 --> 36:06.359
Many of the Ionians believed...

36:06.561 --> 36:11.055
...that the underlying harmony and
unity of the universe was accessible...

36:11.265 --> 36:13.961
...through observation
and experiment...

36:14.168 --> 36:16.636
...the method which dominates
science today.

36:16.904 --> 36:19.668
However, Pythagoras had
a very different method.

36:19.874 --> 36:24.811
He believed that the laws of nature
can be deduced by pure thought.

36:25.213 --> 36:28.273
He and his followers were not
basically experimentalists...

36:28.483 --> 36:30.280
...they were mathematicians...

36:30.485 --> 36:33.352
<i>... and they were</i>
<i>thoroughgoing mystics.</i>

36:34.255 --> 36:38.191
<i>They were fascinated by these</i>
<i>five regular solids...</i>

36:38.392 --> 36:41.691
<i>... bodies whose faces</i>
<i>are all polygons:</i>

36:41.896 --> 36:44.524
<i>Triangles or squares...</i>

36:44.732 --> 36:46.131
<i>... or pentagons.</i>

36:46.334 --> 36:49.098
<i>There can be an infinite number</i>
<i>of polygons...</i>

36:49.303 --> 36:52.329
<i>... but only five regular solids.</i>

36:54.909 --> 36:59.846
<i>Four of the solids were associated</i>
<i>with earth, fire, air and water.</i>

37:00.515 --> 37:04.110
<i>The cube, for example,</i>
<i>represented earth.</i>

37:04.318 --> 37:08.414
<i>These four elements, they thought,</i>
<i>make up terrestrial matter.</i>

37:09.790 --> 37:11.587
<i>So the fifth solid...</i>

37:11.792 --> 37:15.023
<i>... they mystically associated</i>
<i>with the cosmos.</i>

37:15.229 --> 37:18.130
<i>Perhaps it was the substance</i>
<i>of the heavens.</i>

37:18.332 --> 37:20.892
<i>This fifth solid was called...</i>

37:21.102 --> 37:23.570
<i>... the dodecahedron.</i>

37:23.938 --> 37:27.430
<i>Its faces are pentagons, 12 of them.</i>

37:28.042 --> 37:29.771
<i>Knowledge of the dodecahedron...</i>

37:29.977 --> 37:33.242
<i>... was considered too dangerous</i>
<i>for the public.</i>

37:35.483 --> 37:39.943
Ordinary people were to be
kept ignorant of the dodecahedron.

37:40.187 --> 37:43.020
In love with whole numbers,
the Pythagoreans believed...

37:43.224 --> 37:45.385
...that all things could be
derived from them...

37:45.593 --> 37:47.584
...certainly all other numbers.

37:47.795 --> 37:50.821
So a crisis in doctrine occurred
when they discovered...

37:51.032 --> 37:53.466
...that the square root of two
was irrational.

37:53.668 --> 37:56.796
The square root of two could
not be represented as the ratio...

37:57.004 --> 37:59.700
...of two whole numbers
no matter how big they were.

38:00.074 --> 38:02.770
Irrational originally meant
only that...

38:02.977 --> 38:05.946
...that you can't express a number
as a ratio.

38:06.147 --> 38:09.344
But for the Pythagoreans,
it came to mean something else...

38:09.550 --> 38:11.450
...something threatening...

38:11.652 --> 38:15.748
...a hint that their world-view
might not make sense...

38:15.957 --> 38:18.790
...the other meaning of irrational.

38:19.694 --> 38:24.358
Instead of wanting everyone to share
and know of their discoveries...

38:24.565 --> 38:27.762
...the Pythagoreans suppressed
the square root of two...

38:27.969 --> 38:29.630
...and the dodecahedron.

38:29.837 --> 38:32.328
The outside world was not to know.

38:38.245 --> 38:40.509
<i>The Pythagoreans had discovered...</i>

38:40.715 --> 38:43.343
<i>... in the mathematical underpinnings</i>
<i>of nature...</i>

38:43.551 --> 38:46.179
<i>... one of the two most</i>
<i>powerful scientific tools.</i>

38:46.387 --> 38:49.481
<i>The other, of course, is experiment.</i>

38:49.790 --> 38:52.350
<i>But instead of using their insight</i>
<i>to advance...</i>

38:52.560 --> 38:55.222
<i>... the collective voyage</i>
<i>of human discovery...</i>

38:55.429 --> 38:59.991
<i>... they made of it little more</i>
<i>than the hocus-pocus of a mystery cult.</i>

39:00.201 --> 39:03.295
<i>Science and mathematics were to be</i>
<i>removed from the hands...</i>

39:03.504 --> 39:05.131
<i>... of merchants and artisans.</i>

39:06.073 --> 39:09.008
<i>This tendency found its most</i>
<i>effective advocate...</i>

39:09.210 --> 39:12.577
<i>... in a follower of Pythagoras</i>
<i>named Plato.</i>

39:12.847 --> 39:17.546
<i>He preferred the perfection</i>
<i>of these mathematical abstractions...</i>

39:17.752 --> 39:20.880
<i>... to the imperfections</i>
<i>of everyday life.</i>

39:21.088 --> 39:25.422
<i>He believed that ideas were far more</i>
<i>real than the natural world.</i>

39:25.626 --> 39:28.254
<i>He advised the astronomers</i>
<i>not to waste their time...</i>

39:28.462 --> 39:30.191
<i>... observing stars and planets.</i>

39:30.398 --> 39:33.959
<i>It was better, he believed,</i>
<i>just to think about them.</i>

39:34.802 --> 39:38.397
<i>Plato expressed hostility to</i>
<i>observation and experiment.</i>

39:38.606 --> 39:41.040
<i>He taught contempt</i>
<i>for the real world...</i>

39:41.242 --> 39:45.235
<i>... and disdain for the practical</i>
<i>application of scientific knowledge.</i>

39:46.914 --> 39:50.645
<i>Plato's followers succeeded</i>
<i>in extinguishing the light...</i>

39:50.851 --> 39:52.682
<i>... of science and experiment...</i>

39:52.887 --> 39:57.187
<i>... that had been kindled</i>
<i>by Democritus and the other lonians.</i>

40:00.027 --> 40:03.428
<i>Plato's unease with the world</i>
<i>as revealed by our senses...</i>

40:03.631 --> 40:08.364
<i>... was to dominate</i>
<i>and stifle Western philosophy.</i>

40:10.805 --> 40:12.602
<i>Even as late as 1600...</i>

40:12.807 --> 40:16.174
<i>... Johannes Kepler was still</i>
<i>struggling to interpret...</i>

40:16.377 --> 40:18.470
<i>... the structure of</i>
<i>the cosmos in terms of...</i>

40:18.679 --> 40:23.116
<i>... Pythagorean solids</i>
<i>and Platonic perfection.</i>

40:23.317 --> 40:27.253
<i>Ironically, it was Kepler who helped</i>
<i>re-establish the old Ionian method...</i>

40:27.455 --> 40:29.889
<i>... of testing ideas</i>
<i>against observations.</i>

40:30.424 --> 40:33.257
<i>But why had science lost its way</i>
<i>in the first place?</i>

40:33.461 --> 40:36.396
<i>What appeal did Pythagoras'</i>
<i>and Plato's teachings...</i>

40:36.597 --> 40:38.462
<i>... have for their contemporaries?</i>

40:38.666 --> 40:40.293
<i>They provided, I believe...</i>

40:40.501 --> 40:43.436
<i>... an intellectually</i>
<i>respectable justification...</i>

40:43.637 --> 40:46.504
<i>... for a corrupt social order.</i>

40:50.077 --> 40:53.274
<i>The mercantile tradition which had</i>
<i>led to Ionian science...</i>

40:53.481 --> 40:55.745
<i>... also led to a slave economy.</i>

40:56.617 --> 40:58.608
You could get richer...

40:58.819 --> 41:01.379
...if you owned a lot of slaves.

41:01.756 --> 41:04.748
Athens, in the time
of Plato and Aristotle...

41:04.959 --> 41:07.723
...had a vast slave population.

41:07.928 --> 41:11.830
All of that brave Athenian talk
about democracy...

41:12.032 --> 41:14.933
...applied only to a privileged few.

41:15.536 --> 41:19.870
Plato and Aristotle were comfortable
in a slave society.

41:20.074 --> 41:23.168
They offered justifications
for oppression.

41:23.811 --> 41:25.779
They served tyrants.

41:25.980 --> 41:29.143
They taught the alienation
of the body from the mind...

41:29.350 --> 41:33.377
...a natural enough idea, I suppose,
in a slave society.

41:33.587 --> 41:36.112
They separated thought from matter.

41:36.323 --> 41:38.689
They divorced the Earth
from the heavens.

41:38.893 --> 41:42.761
Divisions which were to dominate
Western thinking...

41:42.963 --> 41:45.056
...for more than 20 centuries.

41:45.266 --> 41:47.700
The Pythagoreans had won.

41:53.874 --> 41:56.900
<i>In the recognition by</i>
<i>Pythagoras and Plato...</i>

41:57.111 --> 41:59.079
<i>... that the cosmos is knowable...</i>

41:59.280 --> 42:02.374
<i>... that there is a mathematical</i>
<i>underpinning to nature...</i>

42:02.583 --> 42:05.677
<i>... they greatly advanced</i>
<i>the cause of science.</i>

42:06.287 --> 42:10.348
<i>But in the suppression</i>
<i>of disquieting facts...</i>

42:10.558 --> 42:15.257
<i>... the sense that science should be</i>
<i>kept for a small elite...</i>

42:15.462 --> 42:19.523
<i>... the distaste for experiment,</i>
<i>the embrace of mysticism...</i>

42:20.167 --> 42:23.500
<i>... the easy acceptance</i>
<i>of slave societies...</i>

42:23.704 --> 42:27.572
<i>... their influence has</i>
<i>significantly set back...</i>

42:27.775 --> 42:29.402
<i>... the human endeavor.</i>

42:30.778 --> 42:35.715
The books of the Ionian scientists
are entirely lost.

42:36.617 --> 42:41.350
Their views were suppressed,
ridiculed and forgotten...

42:42.122 --> 42:44.784
...by the Platonists
and by the Christians...

42:44.992 --> 42:48.484
...who adopted much of
the philosophy of Plato.

42:49.263 --> 42:53.996
<i>Finally, after a long,</i>
<i>mystical sleep...</i>

42:54.268 --> 42:58.864
<i>... in which the tools of</i>
<i>scientific inquiry lay moldering...</i>

42:59.073 --> 43:01.871
<i>... the Ionian approach was</i>
<i>rediscovered.</i>

43:06.847 --> 43:09.543
<i>The Western world reawakened.</i>

43:09.750 --> 43:13.208
<i>Experiment and open inquiry...</i>

43:13.420 --> 43:16.821
<i>... slowly became respectable</i>
<i>once again.</i>

43:17.524 --> 43:21.585
Forgotten books and fragments were
read once more.

43:21.962 --> 43:26.023
Leonardo and Copernicus
and Columbus...

43:26.233 --> 43:29.396
...were inspired by
the Ionian tradition.

43:41.649 --> 43:45.449
<i>The Pythagoreans</i>
<i>and their successors...</i>

43:45.653 --> 43:48.645
<i>... held the peculiar notion that...</i>

43:48.856 --> 43:51.120
<i>... the Earth was tainted...</i>

43:51.325 --> 43:53.759
<i>... somehow nasty...</i>

43:53.961 --> 43:58.591
<i>... while the heavens were</i>
<i>pristine and divine.</i>

43:59.266 --> 44:01.996
<i>So the fundamental idea</i>
<i>that the Earth is a planet...</i>

44:02.202 --> 44:04.932
<i>... that we're citizens</i>
<i>of the universe...</i>

44:05.139 --> 44:07.869
<i>... was rejected and forgotten.</i>

44:11.278 --> 44:15.078
<i>This idea was first argued</i>
<i>by Aristarchus...</i>

44:15.282 --> 44:19.241
<i>... born here on Samos,</i>
<i>three centuries after Pythagoras.</i>

44:19.453 --> 44:22.286
<i>He held that the Earth moves</i>
<i>around the sun.</i>

44:22.489 --> 44:25.720
<i>He correctly located our place</i>
<i>in the solar system.</i>

44:25.926 --> 44:29.794
<i>For his trouble,</i>
<i>he was accused of heresy.</i>

44:31.565 --> 44:35.899
From the size of the Earth's shadow
on the moon during a lunar eclipse...

44:36.103 --> 44:40.301
...he deduced that the sun
had to be much, much larger...

44:40.507 --> 44:43.601
...than the Earth,
and also very far away.

44:44.011 --> 44:46.605
From this he may have argued
that it was absurd...

44:46.814 --> 44:49.840
...for so large an object as the sun
to be going around...

44:50.050 --> 44:53.144
...so small an object as the Earth.

44:53.354 --> 44:58.223
So he put the sun rather than the Earth
at the center of the solar system.

44:58.425 --> 45:01.952
And he had the Earth and the other
planets going around the sun.

45:02.162 --> 45:05.529
He also had the Earth rotating
on its axis once a day.

45:05.733 --> 45:09.897
These are ideas that we ordinarily
associate with the name Copernicus.

45:10.104 --> 45:13.596
But Copernicus seems to have gotten
some hint of these ideas...

45:13.807 --> 45:16.435
...by reading about Aristarchus.

45:16.910 --> 45:19.640
In fact, in the manuscript
of Copernicus' book...

45:19.847 --> 45:23.283
...he referred to Aristarchus,
but in the final version...

45:23.484 --> 45:26.180
...he suppressed the citation.

45:26.887 --> 45:29.754
Resistance to Aristarchus,
a kind of...

45:30.391 --> 45:32.882
...geocentrism in everyday life,
is with us still.

45:33.093 --> 45:36.028
We still talk about a sun rising...

45:36.230 --> 45:38.698
...and the sun setting.

45:39.400 --> 45:41.994
It's 2200 years since Aristarchus...

45:42.202 --> 45:47.071
...and the language still pretends
that the Earth does not turn...

45:47.908 --> 45:51.935
<i>... that the sun is not at the center</i>
<i>of the solar system.</i>

45:55.049 --> 45:58.815
<i>Aristarchus understood the basic</i>
<i>scheme of the solar system...</i>

45:59.019 --> 46:00.782
<i>... but not its scale.</i>

46:03.390 --> 46:07.053
<i>He knew that the planets move</i>
<i>in concentric orbits about the sun...</i>

46:07.261 --> 46:10.492
<i>... and he probably knew their order</i>
<i>out to Saturn.</i>

46:12.032 --> 46:14.262
<i>But he was much too modest</i>
<i>in his estimates...</i>

46:14.468 --> 46:16.959
<i>... of how far apart the planets are.</i>

46:17.304 --> 46:20.671
<i>In order to calculate the true scale</i>
<i>of the solar system...</i>

46:20.874 --> 46:22.501
<i>... you need a telescope.</i>

46:22.910 --> 46:26.402
<i>It wasn't until the 17th century</i>
<i>that astronomers were able to get...</i>

46:26.613 --> 46:30.310
<i>... even a rough estimate</i>
<i>of the distance to the sun.</i>

46:32.319 --> 46:34.810
<i>And once you knew</i>
<i>the distance to the sun...</i>

46:35.022 --> 46:36.580
<i>... what about the stars?</i>

46:36.790 --> 46:39.224
<i>How far away are they?</i>

46:43.130 --> 46:46.622
<i>There is a way to measure</i>
<i>the distance to the stars...</i>

46:46.834 --> 46:49.564
...and the Ionians were
fully capable of discovering it.

46:49.770 --> 46:53.570
Aristarchus had toyed
with the daring idea...

46:53.774 --> 46:56.504
...that the stars were distant suns.

46:56.710 --> 46:59.178
Now, if a star were as near
as the sun...

46:59.379 --> 47:02.610
...it should appear as big
and as bright as the sun.

47:02.816 --> 47:06.582
Everyone knows that the farther away
an object is, the smaller it seems.

47:06.787 --> 47:10.245
This inverse proportionality between
apparent size and distance...

47:10.457 --> 47:14.154
...is the basis of perspective
in art and photography.

47:14.361 --> 47:17.057
So the further away we are
from the sun...

47:17.264 --> 47:20.165
...the smaller and dimmer it appears.

47:20.367 --> 47:23.564
How far from the sun would we
have to be for it to appear...

47:23.770 --> 47:26.034
...as small and dim as a star?

47:26.240 --> 47:29.209
Or equivalently,
how small a piece of sun...

47:29.409 --> 47:31.639
...would be as bright as a star?

47:32.012 --> 47:36.506
An experiment to answer this question
was performed in 17 th-century Holland...

47:36.717 --> 47:41.552
...by Christiaan Huygens and is
very much in the Ionian tradition.

47:41.755 --> 47:46.692
Huygens drilled a number of holes
in a brass plate...

47:47.127 --> 47:49.527
...and held the plate up to the sun.

47:49.730 --> 47:54.531
He asked himself,
which hole seemed as bright...

47:54.735 --> 47:59.001
...as he remembered the star Sirius
to have been the previous evening.

47:59.206 --> 48:02.232
Well, the hole that matched was
effectively...

48:02.442 --> 48:07.175
...1/28,000th the apparent size
of the sun.

48:07.447 --> 48:11.508
So Sirius, he reasoned,
must be 28,000 times...

48:11.718 --> 48:16.018
...further away than the sun,
or about half a light-year away.

48:16.623 --> 48:19.387
It's hard to remember
just how bright a star is...

48:19.593 --> 48:23.427
...hours after you've looked at it,
but Huygens remembered very well.

48:23.630 --> 48:27.657
If he had known that Sirius was
intrinsically brighter than the sun...

48:27.868 --> 48:30.268
...he would've gotten
the answer exactly right.

48:30.470 --> 48:34.531
Sirius is 8.8 light-years
away from us.

48:35.509 --> 48:38.376
Between Aristarchus and Huygens...

48:38.579 --> 48:41.810
...people had answered that question
which had so excited me...

48:42.015 --> 48:43.880
...as a young boy growing up
in Brooklyn:

48:44.084 --> 48:46.450
The question, "What are the stars?"

48:49.890 --> 48:54.827
And the answer is that the stars are
mighty suns, light-years away...

48:55.028 --> 48:57.428
...in the depths
of interstellar space.

49:03.237 --> 49:07.571
<i>And around those suns,</i>
<i>are there other planets?</i>

49:08.642 --> 49:10.610
<i>And on those other worlds...</i>

49:10.811 --> 49:13.780
<i>... are there beings</i>
<i>who wonder as we do?</i>

49:18.151 --> 49:20.551
Here is a light bulb...

49:20.754 --> 49:23.314
...which is supposed to represent
a nearby star.

49:23.523 --> 49:26.981
Next to it, and very hard to see
because of the bright light...

49:27.194 --> 49:28.559
...is a planet.

49:28.762 --> 49:32.289
We'll need a volunteer.
Who would like to come up, please?

49:32.966 --> 49:35.560
Ordinarily, it's hard to
see the planet...

49:35.769 --> 49:39.728
...because it's so close that the star
washes out the planet.

49:39.940 --> 49:44.377
But if we're able to put something
in front of the star...

49:44.578 --> 49:48.105
...to make an artificial eclipse,
then we might be able to see the planet.

49:48.315 --> 49:52.581
I'm gonna stand over here.
Imagine that I'm a telescope...

49:52.786 --> 49:54.219
...somewhere near the Earth.

49:54.421 --> 49:58.323
And, Tab, if you'd slowly move
the disc across.

49:58.525 --> 50:00.516
Good. A little faster would be nice.

50:00.727 --> 50:03.355
Now you're just beginning to cover
over the star.

50:03.563 --> 50:06.589
I really can't see the planet at all.
Keep going.

50:06.800 --> 50:08.267
Now, right there...

50:08.468 --> 50:10.834
...I can't see the star at all...

50:11.038 --> 50:14.940
...and I see the planet lit
by the light of the star.

50:15.142 --> 50:18.475
Now, that is a method for looking
for planets...

50:18.679 --> 50:20.510
...around nearby stars.

50:20.714 --> 50:25.651
And that method uses a spacecraft
to hold the disc...

50:26.186 --> 50:28.654
...and scan the sky
for another telescope...

50:28.855 --> 50:31.585
...to see if there are any planets.

50:31.792 --> 50:36.126
Tab, you accomplished your mission
to look for planets around other stars.

50:36.330 --> 50:39.493
Thank you for being
our interplanetary spacecraft.

50:39.700 --> 50:42.294
So this is one way.

50:42.502 --> 50:45.903
And there are spaceships
that will be able to do this...

50:46.106 --> 50:47.869
...in the next 10 years or so.

50:48.075 --> 50:49.542
And there's another way.

50:49.743 --> 50:52.268
This has already been tried
from the Earth.

50:52.479 --> 50:56.575
Imagine that there's a nearby star
that you can see.

50:56.783 --> 51:00.776
It's bright and it has
a dark companion, a planet...

51:00.987 --> 51:04.388
...shining only by reflected light
near it, so dim you can't see it.

51:04.591 --> 51:09.358
But imagine that this planet
and its star...

51:09.563 --> 51:11.428
...are going around each other.

51:12.566 --> 51:13.897
Like that:

51:14.101 --> 51:16.695
You can see the star,
you can't see the planet.

51:16.903 --> 51:19.269
So now I'm gonna need two volunteers.

51:21.475 --> 51:22.499
You two.

51:23.844 --> 51:26.711
Just to save time
because they're in the front row.

51:26.913 --> 51:29.939
I need one of you to turn
the star and the planet...

51:30.150 --> 51:34.109
...and another person to pull
the star and planet along.

51:34.321 --> 51:35.788
And what you will see...

51:35.989 --> 51:39.322
...is that the star
you can make out...

51:39.526 --> 51:42.154
...will be moving
in a funny, wiggly pattern...

51:42.362 --> 51:44.489
...which will be the clue,
the evidence...

51:44.698 --> 51:46.962
...for the existence
of the dark planet.

51:47.167 --> 51:50.364
Okay, let's have a spin. Good.
And a pull.

51:50.570 --> 51:52.231
And you see this funny motion...

51:52.439 --> 51:57.103
...that the star makes
because of the planet. Thank you.

51:57.310 --> 52:00.507
That's another way of finding out
the existence of a planet...

52:00.714 --> 52:03.615
...that you couldn't see directly.

52:03.817 --> 52:06.945
Well, both of these methods are
being used.

52:07.254 --> 52:11.918
And by the time that you people are...

52:12.125 --> 52:13.922
...as old as I am...

52:14.127 --> 52:17.494
...we should know,
for all the nearest stars...

52:17.697 --> 52:20.131
...if they have planets
going around them.

52:20.333 --> 52:24.702
We might know dozens or even hundreds
of other planetary systems...

52:24.905 --> 52:28.204
...and see if they're like our own
or very different...

52:28.408 --> 52:32.003
...or no other planets
going around other stars at all.

52:32.212 --> 52:34.476
That will happen in your lifetime.

52:34.681 --> 52:39.345
It'll be the first time in the world's
history that anybody found out...

52:40.086 --> 52:42.816
...if there are planets
around the other stars.

52:43.023 --> 52:47.960
Now, the nearby stars, the ones
you can see with the naked eye...

52:48.261 --> 52:50.525
...those are all
in the solar neighborhood.

52:50.730 --> 52:53.221
That's what astronomers call it:
The neighborhood.

52:53.433 --> 52:58.029
But it's a very tiny place
in the Milky Way galaxy.

52:58.972 --> 53:01.099
The Milky Way is that band of light...

53:01.308 --> 53:04.402
...that you see across the sky
on a clear night.

53:04.611 --> 53:07.739
I can't tell if there are any more
clear nights in Brooklyn.

53:07.948 --> 53:11.611
You must've seen the Milky Way,
a faint band of light at night.

53:11.818 --> 53:16.448
Well, that's just 100 billion stars...

53:16.656 --> 53:18.590
...all seen together...

53:18.792 --> 53:21.386
...edge on, as in this picture.

53:21.595 --> 53:24.928
If you could get out of
the Milky Way and look down on it...

53:25.131 --> 53:27.031
...it would look like that picture.

53:27.234 --> 53:29.395
If we did look down
on the Milky Way...

53:29.603 --> 53:32.299
...where would the sun
and nearby stars be?

53:32.506 --> 53:35.669
Would it be in the center where things
look important...

53:35.876 --> 53:37.343
...or at least well-lit?

53:38.078 --> 53:41.411
No. We would be way out here...

53:41.615 --> 53:45.608
...in the suburbs,
in the countryside of the galaxy.

53:45.819 --> 53:47.480
We're not in any important place.

53:47.687 --> 53:51.453
All the stars you could see would be
in a little place like that.

53:51.658 --> 53:54.855
And the Milky Way would be
this band of light...

53:55.061 --> 53:57.621
...100 billion stars all together.

53:58.098 --> 54:01.033
The fact that we live
in the outskirts of the galaxy...

54:01.234 --> 54:04.726
...was discovered a long time ago...

54:04.938 --> 54:07.498
...towards the end
of the First World War...

54:07.707 --> 54:10.005
...by a man named Harlow Shapley...

54:10.210 --> 54:14.442
...who was mapping the position
of these clusters of stars.

54:14.648 --> 54:17.139
See, every one of these is a bunch...

54:17.350 --> 54:19.818
...of maybe 10,000 stars all together.

54:20.020 --> 54:22.011
It's called a globular cluster.

54:22.222 --> 54:25.521
And you can see that they are
centered around the middle...

54:25.725 --> 54:27.556
...the center of the galaxy.

54:27.827 --> 54:31.593
People used to think that the sun was
at the center of the galaxy...

54:31.798 --> 54:36.030
...something important about our
position. That turns out to be wrong.

54:36.369 --> 54:38.599
We live in the outskirts...

54:38.805 --> 54:41.239
...the globular clusters are
centered around...

54:41.741 --> 54:45.404
...the marvelous middle
of the Milky Way galaxy.

54:45.612 --> 54:49.446
And then it turned out
that this isn't the only galaxy.

54:49.649 --> 54:52.083
We live in this one...

54:52.686 --> 54:54.449
...but there are many others.

54:54.821 --> 54:57.813
And as this picture reminds us...

54:58.525 --> 55:00.959
...there are many different kinds
of galaxies...

55:01.161 --> 55:03.561
...of which ours might be
just this one.

55:03.763 --> 55:08.325
There are, in fact,
100 billion other galaxies...

55:08.535 --> 55:13.472
...each of which contains
something like 100 billion stars.

55:14.207 --> 55:19.144
Think of how many stars and planets
and kinds of life there may be...

55:19.946 --> 55:24.110
...in this vast and awesome universe.

55:26.920 --> 55:29.081
<i>As long as there have been humans...</i>

55:29.289 --> 55:32.690
<i>... we have searched</i>
<i>for our place in the cosmos.</i>

55:32.892 --> 55:35.690
<i>Where are we? Who are we?</i>

55:37.797 --> 55:42.097
<i>We find that we live</i>
<i>on an insignificant planet...</i>

55:42.302 --> 55:44.270
<i>... of a humdrum star...</i>

55:44.471 --> 55:47.634
<i>... lost in a galaxy</i>
<i>tucked away in some...</i>

55:47.841 --> 55:51.038
<i>... forgotten corner of a universe</i>
<i>in which there are...</i>

55:51.244 --> 55:54.509
<i>... far more galaxies than people.</i>

55:57.751 --> 56:01.517
<i>We make our world significant by</i>
<i>the courage of our questions...</i>

56:01.955 --> 56:04.583
<i>... and by the depth of our answers.</i>

56:06.159 --> 56:09.253
<i>We embarked on our journey</i>
<i>to the stars...</i>

56:09.863 --> 56:12.457
<i>... with a question first framed...</i>

56:12.666 --> 56:15.191
<i>... in the childhood of our species...</i>

56:15.635 --> 56:19.901
<i>... and in each generation</i>
<i>asked anew...</i>

56:20.173 --> 56:22.334
<i>... with undiminished wonder:</i>

56:22.709 --> 56:24.870
<i>"What are the stars?"</i>

56:42.962 --> 56:45.829
<i>Exploration is in our nature.</i>

56:46.433 --> 56:48.731
<i>We began as wanderers...</i>

56:49.035 --> 56:51.902
<i>... and we are wanderers still.</i>

57:03.183 --> 57:05.879
<i>We have lingered long enough...</i>

57:06.086 --> 57:08.884
<i>... on the shores of the cosmic ocean.</i>

57:09.122 --> 57:10.919
<i>We are ready at last...</i>

57:11.124 --> 57:14.355
<i>... to set sail for the stars.</i>
