dragging this through the halls,

You ruined my project.

20:44.530 --> 20:46.449
I'm off to Skylar's pool party.

20:46.450 --> 20:47.989
I don't remember saying that was okay.

20:47.990 --> 20:49.369
You said it last week.

20:49.370 --> 20:51.279
Yeah, and you said that you'd take us

20:51.280 --> 20:52.619
to laser tag tomorrow.

20:52.620 --> 20:55.159
And buy us ice cream after.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.319
Well, I have been very forgetful lately.

20:57.320 --> 21:01.659
It's funny, I've been thinking
about my trip to Rhode Island.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.369
You know, when I got my coffee?

21:03.370 --> 21:06.199
It's so rare that I
treat myself like that.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.619
Well, you should.
It might help your memory.

21:08.620 --> 21:11.819
Thing is, the cup said Suzy.

21:11.820 --> 21:15.449
Right, that's you.
Did you forget that, too?

21:15.450 --> 21:19.869
It's just that when I do go
for coffee, I'm not Suzy.

21:19.870 --> 21:24.869
I'm a carefree single gal
on her way to Paris.

21:24.870 --> 21:27.949
You see, Suzy drinks coffee at home,

21:27.950 --> 21:31.489
but at the coffee shop,
my name is Celeste,

21:31.490 --> 21:35.700
and yet the cup I found in my car...

21:36.660 --> 21:37.989
says Suzy.

21:37.990 --> 21:39.409
That's right,

21:39.410 --> 21:41.239
I figured out your little scheme.

21:41.240 --> 21:42.449
You're all grounded,

21:42.450 --> 21:44.279
and you'll be paying for the ticket

21:44.280 --> 21:45.659
and going to traffic school.

21:45.660 --> 21:46.699
Traffic school?!

21:46.700 --> 21:48.869
And with everyone forgetting everything,

21:48.870 --> 21:51.159
here's something you may
all want to remember.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.659
Don't mess with Mom.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.869
(SIGHING)

21:56.870 --> 22:00.819
I couldn't save him,
but he made a noble sacrifice,

22:00.820 --> 22:03.119
and he's delicious.

22:03.120 --> 22:06.369
Look out, duck pond!

22:06.370 --> 22:09.529
Here I come.

22:09.530 --> 22:10.909
SOPHIE: Harley, no!

22:10.910 --> 22:14.529
- ETHAN: Harley!
- (GIRLS SCREAMING)

22:14.530 --> 22:15.870
BOY: Whoa!

22:21.870 --> 22:24.369
Are you okay?

22:24.370 --> 22:27.120
Forgot to calculate
I weigh more than a watermelon.

22:28.490 --> 22:30.279
I didn't make it to the pond,

22:30.280 --> 22:32.409
but did I have to land in poop?

22:32.410 --> 22:34.029
It's hybrid fertilizer.

22:34.030 --> 22:35.529
Have you smelled me?

22:35.530 --> 22:38.029
I have, and now that I know you're okay,

22:38.030 --> 22:41.079
I'm gonna stop smelling you.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.529
Are you out of your mind?

22:42.530 --> 22:46.699
You risked your neck to save
a silly science project.

22:46.700 --> 22:48.579
That's not what I was trying to save.

22:48.580 --> 22:51.199
Aw.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.739
I'd hug you right now,
but this is actually

22:53.740 --> 22:55.529
as close as I can get without gagging.

22:55.530 --> 22:57.279
That's fair.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.489
HARLEY: It's easy to worry

22:58.490 --> 23:00.949
about your siblings messing things up,

23:00.950 --> 23:04.449
but sometimes, you mess up
all on your own.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.449
The Golden Beaker.

23:06.450 --> 23:07.989
Isn't it beautiful?

23:07.990 --> 23:11.279
Sure is.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.449
Congratulations, Melissa.

23:14.450 --> 23:16.449
Well, we didn't win,

23:16.450 --> 23:18.449
but when people ask how we met,

23:18.450 --> 23:21.659
we've got a pretty good story.

23:21.660 --> 23:25.949
I guess you can lose the trophy
and still win a prize.

23:25.950 --> 23:28.029
All right, this is almost pretty good.
