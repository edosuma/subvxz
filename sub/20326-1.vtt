00:55.203 --> 01:00.176
<b> PARTICULAR BUYER </b>

01:24.020 --> 01:25.353
So...

01:25.555 --> 01:27.075
the small key is the top ...

01:27.490 --> 01:29.017
and the largest is below.

01:29.783 --> 01:31.150
You will stay?

01:31.652 --> 01:33.760
Not at all, I have many
memories here.

01:34.362 --> 01:37.458
- Are you afraid?
- Not at all.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.351
- See you later.
- All right.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.600
Who?

06:09.823 --> 06:11.121
Lewis ¿are you?

06:39.723 --> 06:40.793
Lewis ...

07:14.565 --> 07:15.591
¿Maureen?

07:17.471 --> 07:18.529
¿Maureen?

07:31.786 --> 07:32.938
I had to sleep.

07:33.158 --> 07:34.273
And tell me?

07:36.454 --> 07:37.494
There was a presence.

07:38.781 --> 07:40.993
I felt something, but ...

07:45.231 --> 07:47.193
I'm not sure I talked
about far.

07:48.362 --> 07:49.625
You need to contact you.

07:50.410 --> 07:52.483
We would have to be both, but ...

07:53.462 --> 07:57.675
something like erratic, this
was far more than ...

08:00.321 --> 08:01.421
Come with me.

08:11.306 --> 08:12.452
You see that cross?

08:14.377 --> 08:15.377
Yes.

08:28.135 --> 08:30.277
<i> <b> She said she could not make contact. </b> </i>

08:30.637 --> 08:32.578
<i> <b> Are you still feeling presences? </b> </i>

08:33.120 --> 08:35.022
<i> <b> Yes, she says the house is inhabited. </b> </i>

08:35.381 --> 08:38.184
<i> <b> Well, we can not buy unless
you are sure. </b> </i>

08:38.606 --> 08:41.969
<i> <b> We need to know whether benevolent or not. </b> </i>

08:41.989 --> 08:43.990
<i> <b> It is too much investment. </b> </i>

08:45.493 --> 08:46.698
So...

08:48.151 --> 08:49.478
I can have something.

08:51.575 --> 08:52.396
I felt something but ...

08:52.497 --> 08:54.055
I need more time.

08:56.005 --> 08:58.953
It is very difficult to open a
portal to the spirit world.

08:59.155 --> 09:00.356
Both at once.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.571
I went to Stockholm last week ...

09:02.772 --> 09:06.541
I saw a beautiful exhibition
at the art museum.

09:07.844 --> 09:10.952
Hilma Af Kliot Had
you heard of it?

09:13.063 --> 09:13.907
Do not.

09:14.008 --> 09:15.615
She said the spirits.

09:15.616 --> 09:17.243
He ordered his paintings.

09:17.844 --> 09:19.449
She invented abstract art

09:19.649 --> 09:21.550
Kandinsky and Malevich before ...

09:22.208 --> 09:24.016
1906.

09:24.217 --> 09:28.005
She says the mind communicates
with us.

09:28.040 --> 09:29.679
Through him.

09:53.964 --> 09:55.626
<i> <b> Summary. </b> </i>

09:55.886 --> 09:56.927
<i> <b> Pioneer. </b> </i>

09:57.047 --> 10:00.751
<i> <b> What fascinated me when I discovered
Hilma af Klint's work was ... </b> </i>

10:00.971 --> 10:05.676
<i> <b> ... that these large and enigmatic paintings
had been painted in the early 1900s. </b> </i>

10:05.876 --> 10:08.309
<i> <b> And they were made by a
Swedish woman ... </b> </i>

10:08.510 --> 10:10.982
<i> <b> ... which artist had not
heard before. </b> </i>

10:11.109 --> 10:13.652
<i> <b> Perhaps the most fascinating part
is that these parts ... </b> </i>

10:13.963 --> 10:17.162
<i> <b> ... were prior to conception
of abstract art. </b> </i>

10:18.329 --> 10:21.784
<i> <b> Hilma af Klint But his
art kept secret. </b> </i>

10:21.892 --> 10:26.417
<i> <b> I was sure he would not be understood
in his lifetime. </b> </i>

10:27.418 --> 10:29.041
<i> <b> In his will decided that would
be displayed ... </b> </i>

10:29.065 --> 10:32.407
<i> <b> ... in the first 20 years
after his death. </b> </i>

10:33.286 --> 10:37.790
<i> <b> A hundred years ago Hilma af Klint
painted for the future. </b> </i>

10:38.231 --> 10:40.874
<i> <b> And the future is here now. </b> </i>

10:49.864 --> 10:50.936
You're good?

10:51.037 --> 10:52.854
You do not have bothered at the reception?

10:52.956 --> 10:54.057
Do not.

10:54.458 --> 10:55.970
No more than usual.

10:56.171 --> 10:57.172
I left my passport.

10:58.355 --> 10:59.604
What time do you have in Milan?

10:59.805 --> 11:00.806
Two days.

11:01.007 --> 11:02.293
We have everything in the rack.

11:03.784 --> 11:06.375
There are leather pants
for the new collection.

11:07.864 --> 11:09.009
It is the style of Kyra.

11:09.110 --> 11:10.625
I can not see well with ...

11:11.127 --> 11:13.861
They seem too big.

11:14.261 --> 11:15.967
I'll take these to see.

11:42.929 --> 11:44.887
They were not in the shop.

11:45.088 --> 11:46.453
It is not supposed to, but ...

11:46.477 --> 11:48.357
Please bring them fast ...

11:48.558 --> 11:50.118
as soon as possible otherwise
you will have problems.

11:50.142 --> 11:51.142
- Yes I
understand.

11:51.270 --> 11:52.415
You need something that attracts attention ...

11:52.416 --> 11:53.387
just in case.

11:53.388 --> 11:54.388
Yes.

11:57.004 --> 11:59.334
This is the most casual of "Louis".

12:00.379 --> 12:03.010
If "Louis" likes, she'll like it.

12:07.630 --> 12:08.679
You like?

12:09.080 --> 12:11.350
Collection of "Louis"
is not easy to find.

12:15.973 --> 12:18.077
It is sensual and very resistant.

12:20.196 --> 12:21.250
I'll take it.

12:21.351 --> 12:22.453
It goes with boots.

12:22.654 --> 12:23.855
Very good.

13:07.504 --> 13:09.892
I'll take both,
belt and bag.

13:10.398 --> 13:11.600
You already know.

13:11.801 --> 13:12.911
I can not tell.

13:14.221 --> 13:15.715
Kyra likes the brown ...

13:16.744 --> 13:18.421
Or blue, or none.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.722
I got a check unfilled.

13:21.923 --> 13:24.027
- Can they accept?
- Yes.

13:24.228 --> 13:25.939
Yes, it would be for $ 4.500.00

13:26.441 --> 13:29.091
$ 500 and $ 2000 belt
for each bag.

13:29.292 --> 13:30.294
Great.

14:25.638 --> 14:28.068
<i> will return as soon as possible,
I had to leave ... </i>

14:28.269 --> 14:29.566
<i> I leave this message ... </i>

14:29.767 --> 14:31.310
<i> back to Milan tomorrow morning. </i>

14:31.511 --> 14:34.054
<i> I left an envelope with money
for what I owe you. </i>

14:34.155 --> 14:35.585
<i> Take care of yourself ... Kyra. </i>

14:36.187 --> 14:39.709
<i> PS I left my Mac on the desktop,
please update it </i>.

15:42.225 --> 15:45.421
<i> Hilma Af Klint is frequents to participate
in spiritual circles ... </i>

15:45.622 --> 15:47.564
<i> and participant in meetings ... </i>

15:47.765 --> 15:50.547
<i> then as a means ... </i>

15:50.548 --> 15:54.465
<i> what exactly the essence
of spiritualism? </i>

15:54.466 --> 15:57.293
<i> Well, the central idea of ​​spiritualism ... </i>

15:57.328 --> 16:01.178
<i> is the idea that there is a world beyond. </i>

16:01.279 --> 16:05.838
<i> The spiritualists have tried to prove
the empirical evidence ... </i>

16:06.039 --> 16:09.981
<i> In 1848 the Fox sisters
heard gunshots ... </i>

16:10.082 --> 16:12.437
<i> and interpret these shots as ... </i>

16:12.637 --> 16:14.869
<i> as messages from the dead ... </i>

16:15.270 --> 16:18.450
<i> which is a real test for them ... </i>

16:18.451 --> 16:22.136
<i> of the existence of a higher world. </i>

16:22.363 --> 16:25.266
<i> It's very interesting because the
code was invented walrus ... </i>

16:25.467 --> 16:26.897
<i> two years earlier. </i>

16:26.918 --> 16:31.500
<i> Spiritualists have always been linked
to the forefront of technology ... </i>

16:31.535 --> 16:34.464
<i> For example the first abstract
pictures ... </i>

16:34.465 --> 16:37.357
<i> have been the work of the spiritual. </i>

16:37.392 --> 16:40.122
<i> Hilma af Klint believed to receive ... </i>

16:40.323 --> 16:43.733
<i> abstract paintings of her in the highest
levels of consciousness. </i>

16:43.768 --> 16:45.674
<i> When she started painting
as a means ... </i>

16:46.308 --> 16:49.988
<i> she rejected the learned technique
Academy of Fine Arts .. </i>

16:50.322 --> 16:52.911
<i> And that because of an influence ... </i>

16:52.912 --> 16:55.067
<i> spiritualism and theosophy. </i>

16:55.069 --> 16:56.804
<i> You mention that Theosophy ... </i>

16:56.805 --> 16:59.552
<i> who is thinking of Rudolf
Steiner abstract art. </i>

16:59.753 --> 17:03.362
<i> Steiner rejected abstract painting ... </i>

17:03.363 --> 17:04.806
<i> but it's more complicated ... </i>

17:05.107 --> 17:06.250
<i> many things ... </i>

17:07.152 --> 17:08.153
Hi.

17:08.255 --> 17:10.214
<i> I tried to talk to
you for a week. </i>

17:10.363 --> 17:11.970
Yes I know, I've been working ...

17:12.172 --> 17:13.173
too.

17:14.277 --> 17:15.922
<i> What about Kyra. </i>

17:17.371 --> 17:18.577
I hardly see her.

17:18.878 --> 17:20.267
Nothing we massaged.

17:21.486 --> 17:22.663
I actually like this job.

17:22.686 --> 17:24.228
I hate reality.

17:24.507 --> 17:25.983
<i> That's not said before. </i>

17:26.888 --> 17:30.882
Yes, I was happy in Paris
and pay my rent ...

17:30.883 --> 17:31.885
Yes, what change?

17:32.486 --> 17:34.897
My days are stupid things ...

17:34.898 --> 17:38.647
is not what interests
me, it's crazy.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.266
You should come here.

17:41.967 --> 17:44.209
Yes, in Oman.

17:44.510 --> 17:46.012
<i> Yes, you still have two months. </i>

17:47.743 --> 17:48.867
Then you just almost.

17:48.968 --> 17:52.322
<i> Just I finished with the system
include the NBC computer ... </i>

17:52.524 --> 17:54.849
<i> and wait for security protocol. </i>

17:55.451 --> 17:56.863
When are you going to finish that?

17:57.064 --> 17:59.200
<i> Maybe tomorrow or next month. </i>

17:59.801 --> 18:03.473
<i> It's about making installation
and set up. </i>

18:04.359 --> 18:05.400
<i> Come to Musacat. </i>

18:06.302 --> 18:07.302
<i> Watch: </i>

18:07.336 --> 18:09.495
<i> Come to the ocean for the weekend. </i>

18:14.971 --> 18:16.716
- Heaven. - Its
beautiful.

18:19.704 --> 18:21.467
And what the hell do in Musacat.

18:21.468 --> 18:22.833
<i> And what the hell are you doing in Paris? </i>

18:24.958 --> 18:26.182
Now you know...

18:26.584 --> 18:29.064
Waiting, waiting and waiting.

18:30.172 --> 18:31.830
<i> In three months? </i>

18:35.274 --> 18:37.064
I think I felt something.

18:37.161 --> 18:39.135
I have to return
home to Lewis.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.644
I really think I felt something.

18:41.045 --> 18:43.286
<i> Do you think or are you sure? </i>

18:44.583 --> 18:47.404
Just pass, that's all.

18:49.972 --> 18:51.219
This is perfect.

18:51.420 --> 18:53.819
This first thanks.
This one too.

18:57.006 --> 18:58.449
Consider this.

19:00.802 --> 19:02.292
I think this is perfect.

19:04.937 --> 19:06.479
I would like to see you in.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.970
Will not you try it?

19:10.174 --> 19:11.651
You know I can not.

19:12.346 --> 19:13.928
But if you want, yes.

19:15.123 --> 19:17.317
Sure, if you knew you
shut up, maybe ...

19:17.518 --> 19:19.683
I put in doubt the last
time, but I will.

19:20.085 --> 19:22.345
Try on one of these.
I bring to you.

19:26.976 --> 19:28.492
It's the same extent.

19:28.593 --> 19:30.186
If you do not like you return.

19:31.765 --> 19:32.849
Okay, Vincent.

19:33.916 --> 19:35.285
You must promise.

19:36.445 --> 19:37.453
Not a word.

19:37.855 --> 19:39.716
- Not even one. - My
lips are sealed.

20:14.762 --> 20:15.562
<i> Really? </i>

20:15.663 --> 20:18.412
You are stuck in traffic, then
there will be nothing.

20:18.504 --> 20:19.504
They'll wait ...

20:20.316 --> 20:22.116
It will be the day when
you arrive, but okay.

20:22.705 --> 20:25.794
No, I can not stay. I have
an appointment elsewhere.

20:25.995 --> 20:28.202
A little later in the afternoon.

20:29.023 --> 20:30.023
Agree.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.809
Leather pants, great right?

20:34.821 --> 20:36.972
No, I can not be me, I promise ...

20:37.674 --> 20:40.876
I promise I'll be back tomorrow,
do it for me.

20:44.447 --> 20:46.974
And so we were, do not
call, do not worry.

20:48.208 --> 20:51.511
Hey, it happens that the plane
was late to Milan ...

20:52.012 --> 20:53.341
But where is she?

20:53.442 --> 20:55.775
It is on the road,
stuck in traffic.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.000
Can you do it for her?

20:57.201 --> 20:58.562
So you save time.

20:59.669 --> 21:02.143
- I have to leave
at 4. - Okay.

21:02.244 --> 21:03.944
At 4 it is perfect. Come.

21:05.150 --> 21:06.544
Do you think you launch it?

21:06.555 --> 21:07.956
Yes, it will launch everything.

21:08.158 --> 21:10.085
I have three other options.

21:10.286 --> 21:12.013
What will happen?

21:12.314 --> 21:14.665
I can not promise that.

21:15.267 --> 21:17.277
You tell me if you if you stay comfortable.

21:19.734 --> 21:20.885
You're afraid of Kyra.

21:20.886 --> 21:22.864
It seems to be a monster.

21:29.886 --> 21:31.773
This is your left ventricle.

21:32.278 --> 21:34.123
It's something bigger.

21:34.324 --> 21:36.890
It's exactly like your
twin brother.

21:38.971 --> 21:41.245
You can live with this you
will die at age 100.

21:41.446 --> 21:42.765
At 27.

21:44.024 --> 21:45.935
Like Lewis I have followed you.

21:46.136 --> 21:47.909
An ultrasound twice a year.

21:48.104 --> 21:51.910
No signs, nothing, will
one day break.

21:53.052 --> 21:56.203
Do not panic, what happened to
Lewis was something special.

21:58.524 --> 21:59.682
You can get up.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.659
Everything is fine.

22:13.760 --> 22:16.922
Continues roasted, avoid intense efforts ...

22:16.923 --> 22:18.397
and extreme emotions.

22:18.699 --> 22:20.177
As Lewis ...

22:20.779 --> 22:23.190
and I ... he was a cabinetmaker.

22:23.492 --> 22:24.793
Yes I know.

22:27.843 --> 22:29.987
He wanted to transform this
workshop at home ...

22:30.388 --> 22:33.578
teach and practice carpentry.

22:34.681 --> 22:36.982
Indeed he planned the future.

22:38.588 --> 22:40.324
I see you in the next six months.

22:40.925 --> 22:43.428
I have no idea where I'll be
in the next six months.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.023
Good cars. Maureen.

22:49.391 --> 22:50.606
Sorry, I was ...

22:51.108 --> 22:52.586
distracted.

22:52.587 --> 22:54.761
Hi.
Sorry.

22:55.363 --> 22:56.583
Kyra is.

22:56.984 --> 22:58.728
It's in the room with the lawyer.

22:58.829 --> 23:01.010
It has a conference call
from an hour ago.

23:01.211 --> 23:02.742
Problems with the foundation.

23:03.344 --> 23:06.644
Only came to lift a few things.
You know where they are.

23:07.767 --> 23:08.767
Do you know where they are?

23:08.908 --> 23:10.924
There is something there.

23:23.849 --> 23:25.056
Brandon. I have a question.

23:25.057 --> 23:27.660
Do you know where are the
two leather pants?

23:27.861 --> 23:29.171
They should be in the bag.

23:29.473 --> 23:30.943
She stayed with them.

23:35.698 --> 23:36.898
Agree.

23:37.368 --> 23:38.778
She's inside?

23:42.130 --> 23:43.130
She is furious...

23:43.280 --> 23:45.306
that's how I'm scared.

23:54.194 --> 23:56.594
We are working on it 6 months ago.

23:56.695 --> 23:59.417
Press cancel at the last minute.

23:59.618 --> 24:00.619
Hi Kyra.

24:00.620 --> 24:03.237
<i> It was a gorilla 2 years had disappeared
for 3 weeks ... </i>

24:03.261 --> 24:05.164
<i> and now we have family in crisis. </i>

24:05.165 --> 24:08.804
The husband of Ms. Guellman invested much
time and money on those gorillas ...

24:08.805 --> 24:11.205
in animal preserves, this
affects depression.

24:11.406 --> 24:15.177
But I think if it goes wrong. It
is reflected in their business.

24:15.250 --> 24:16.881
I have a question.

24:16.882 --> 24:18.608
This is serious, they need to question it.

24:18.609 --> 24:19.609
Hi.

24:19.610 --> 24:20.777
The female is in depression.

24:20.979 --> 24:23.088
The male Ngabo, becomes aggressive.

24:23.089 --> 24:25.599
- That's why he is aggressive.
- Ngabo can be aggressive ...

24:25.923 --> 24:29.036
in case of stress in these situations,
I remember it perfectly. Thank you!

24:29.060 --> 24:30.587
Where is? Where
is the gorilla?

24:31.188 --> 24:34.870
<i> Well ... I'm in the window and
is now in the mountains ... </i>

24:35.072 --> 24:38.470
- it is difficult to monitor it.
- You can not cancel the press!

24:38.571 --> 24:40.425
We have a contract with them.

24:40.626 --> 24:42.077
We need gorillas are there.

24:42.101 --> 24:43.102
Just a question.

24:43.403 --> 24:47.002
- Some bananas. - We heard
problems, not solutions!

24:53.977 --> 24:55.177
Do you mind if I smoke?

25:01.202 --> 25:03.510
Nothing better equip Kyra?

25:03.711 --> 25:05.930
Is not it a waste of time?

25:08.462 --> 25:10.079
Is listening a better deal?

25:10.180 --> 25:11.288
Not quite.

25:12.472 --> 25:15.506
I can help you get another
job for you.

25:15.607 --> 25:16.708
Thank you.

25:17.968 --> 25:20.637
But the magazine is not for me.

25:22.052 --> 25:23.668
Social...

25:25.020 --> 25:28.353
I like working in commercials.

25:28.554 --> 25:31.320
You have a stupid job.

25:31.321 --> 25:34.380
You can change it, and payment
would be better.

25:38.065 --> 25:39.468
Not for me.

25:41.362 --> 25:44.957
How do you do for photographers published
in a fashion magazine?

25:44.958 --> 25:46.319
They are free to do so.

25:47.157 --> 25:48.157
It's possible.

25:48.478 --> 25:52.900
Yes, they choose the brands and topics.

25:52.901 --> 25:54.099
No, it's novelty.

25:54.734 --> 25:56.339
I did not look where freedom is.

25:57.831 --> 25:58.959
I'm leaving.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.996
So I wear dresses
and bags.

26:03.460 --> 26:06.052
There you say that
back for pants.

26:06.153 --> 26:07.255
And I call back tomorrow.

26:08.004 --> 26:09.672
Do you know if he'll be there tomorrow?

26:13.778 --> 26:15.107
Just ask.

26:16.112 --> 26:17.408
He said he would.

26:20.262 --> 26:21.608
And you're not going?

26:22.009 --> 26:23.089
I'll wait until it finishes.

26:23.412 --> 26:25.003
I need to talk about ...

26:25.205 --> 26:27.015
she wants me to leave me.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.048
¿Last long?

26:31.431 --> 26:32.929
Two years.

26:34.089 --> 26:35.075
But...

26:35.076 --> 26:37.151
she is afraid that her
husband finds out.

26:37.753 --> 26:39.436
I'm sure he suspects something.

26:40.235 --> 26:41.335
Do you love her?

26:41.636 --> 26:42.636
Love?

26:44.195 --> 26:45.884
It never crossed my mind that.

26:46.791 --> 26:47.946
It is physical.

26:50.284 --> 26:51.650
What are you doing in Paris?

26:54.273 --> 26:55.602
Waiting.

26:57.154 --> 26:58.632
I'm leaving.

26:59.169 --> 27:00.507
What are you waiting for?

27:04.784 --> 27:07.439
... My brother
died here.

27:09.106 --> 27:10.308
My brother twin.

27:10.409 --> 27:11.510
He died in Paris.

27:12.277 --> 27:13.417
An accident?

27:13.818 --> 27:14.818
Do not!

27:16.893 --> 27:18.430
He died of a heart attack.

27:21.552 --> 27:24.988
In fact I have the same malformation.

27:28.471 --> 27:29.822
It does not scare you?

27:30.024 --> 27:31.025
Do not.

27:31.326 --> 27:32.812
I think not him.

27:34.238 --> 27:35.767
And you wait until tomorrow?

27:36.569 --> 27:38.786
Not only do I wait, I told you.

27:39.635 --> 27:41.160
And what do you expect?

27:45.100 --> 27:46.599
I swore an oath

27:50.869 --> 27:53.053
Whoever dies you will first send a sign.

27:54.215 --> 27:55.215
Sign?

27:57.244 --> 27:58.747
After death?

27:59.585 --> 28:02.066
You can call it that
or other forms.

28:02.867 --> 28:05.530
But how do you know if it's a sign?

28:06.569 --> 28:08.135
I talk to the dead.

28:08.333 --> 28:10.444
He also spoke to them.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.284
Now I know.

28:16.854 --> 28:20.291
Do you you communicate with your spirit?

28:20.960 --> 28:22.433
Lewis yes.

28:22.635 --> 28:24.524
Spirits ... I'm not sure.

28:25.414 --> 28:26.764
Okay, yes.

28:29.550 --> 28:30.828
Somehow.

28:32.808 --> 28:34.921
Ay presences that can not be seen.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.083
Round the presence ...

28:37.084 --> 28:39.571
around you, sometimes.

28:39.956 --> 28:42.776
If you are the souls of the dead, I know.

28:44.292 --> 28:47.729
When you talk to the dead you are
not sensitive to certain ...

28:50.775 --> 28:52.178
waves.

28:52.728 --> 28:54.707
What do you mean waves?

28:56.692 --> 28:59.001
It's just a gut feeling, a
sensation that feels ...

29:00.540 --> 29:02.121
It's like a door.

29:02.723 --> 29:05.465
As it slides and
left ajar.

29:06.678 --> 29:08.032
And I think maybe?

29:09.321 --> 29:13.504
What the soul continues
to exist after death?

29:14.232 --> 29:16.044
I do not even know if I believe in that.

29:17.684 --> 29:19.989
But the death of Lewis.

29:20.700 --> 29:21.780
I do not know.

29:22.956 --> 29:25.841
I only know that the spirit.

29:27.079 --> 29:29.867
Everyone gives his term
testing him alone.

29:32.157 --> 29:33.457
And until when?

29:34.172 --> 29:35.431
I received a signal.

29:36.134 --> 29:37.736
- Safe?
- Yes.

29:38.738 --> 29:40.632
Are you sure?

29:40.834 --> 29:42.219
No, so I'm waiting.

29:44.440 --> 29:45.595
And then?

29:51.441 --> 29:53.657
Then my spirit left my life.

29:54.738 --> 29:55.807
And I go.

30:48.963 --> 30:50.721
I come for you in the morning.

30:50.922 --> 30:52.370
Or before you call me first.

30:52.571 --> 30:53.672
All right.

30:55.204 --> 30:56.589
Hey thanks.

31:03.152 --> 31:05.976
<i> <b> So think about it, and we
are renewing ... </b> </i>

31:05.988 --> 31:08.178
<i> <b> ... I think that's what
Lewis wanted. </b> </i>

31:08.798 --> 31:11.421
<i> <b> I just wanted people to be at
peace with this place. </b> </i>

31:11.781 --> 31:13.323
<i> <b> And with the spirit of Lewis. </b> </i>

31:22.051 --> 31:24.394
<i> <b> I just want to say something else. </b> </i>

31:24.834 --> 31:28.738
<i> <b> Lewis would have been very happy and
this house is yours again. </b> </i>

31:29.259 --> 31:31.601
<i> <b> And I'm very happy too. </b> </i>

31:32.482 --> 31:36.026
<i> <b> Now, it's your house ... </b> </i>

31:37.148 --> 31:38.870
<i> <b> ... forget it. </b> </i>

32:59.288 --> 33:00.488
Come on.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.278
Come.

34:16.906 --> 34:18.330
Oh something else to do.

34:19.532 --> 34:21.138
Give me something else to do.

34:52.547 --> 34:54.179
Show me more.

34:55.438 --> 34:56.895
Whatever.

35:02.370 --> 35:03.867
Give me a sign.

35:06.583 --> 35:08.538
That is how it is?

35:13.389 --> 35:14.759
You tell me that there is an afterlife.

35:19.408 --> 35:21.822
That's what you want to teach me. Without
being able to speak with me?

35:27.771 --> 35:32.157
I do not want to spook me with plumbing,
I just want you to tell me.

35:33.899 --> 35:35.300
Please do not understand.

35:35.502 --> 35:36.503
Lewis!

35:50.374 --> 35:51.557
You're not my brother.

35:55.266 --> 35:56.655
You know you're not my brother.

38:40.321 --> 38:44.495
<b> Be who you </b>

39:09.990 --> 39:13.563
<b> And you know who I am </b>

39:29.937 --> 39:31.902
<b> You're going to London </b>

39:48.075 --> 39:50.118

<b> What is the difference? </b>

41:08.574 --> 41:11.627
<b> Are you real? </b>

41:24.739 --> 41:26.337
<b> You're alive dead? </b>

41:36.422 --> 41:37.733
<b> Dead or alive? </b>

41:55.590 --> 41:56.874
<b> You Lewis? </b>

42:44.108 --> 42:46.670
<b> I want </b>

42:52.130 --> 42:55.239
<b> No more </b>

42:55.440 --> 42:58.310
<b> I love you and I'll </b>

43:01.983 --> 43:06.365
<b> How did you get this number? </b>

43:10.896 --> 43:14.712
<b> You'll block </b>

43:16.485 --> 43:19.379
<b> You do not want to know who I am? </b>

43:28.215 --> 43:30.181
<b> Here I am I'm looking </b>

43:41.589 --> 43:44.204
<b> But I can be in London </b>

43:56.741 --> 43:59.331
<b> Want to know where? </b>

44:07.859 --> 44:11.647
<b> Where </b>

44:14.551 --> 44:16.733
<b> Thank you for asking </b>

44:18.375 --> 44:21.860
<b> Where </b>

44:25.139 --> 44:26.612
<b> I'm not in London </b>

44:38.425 --> 44:40.280
<b> Satisfied? </b>

44:51.203 --> 44:52.268
- Thank you.
- Ahead.

45:02.685 --> 45:06.770
<b> What do you want </b>

45:11.428 --> 45:14.607
<b> Not physically </b>

45:14.809 --> 45:16.110
<b> We will contact </b>

45:16.712 --> 45:18.320
<b> First </b>

45:28.566 --> 45:30.623
Here's what he asked Kyra.

45:31.325 --> 45:33.275
Two dresses for photographs,
and ...

45:33.577 --> 45:36.596
And one that is less, but it sees
fit, I think you will like.

45:36.797 --> 45:37.950
Great, what?

45:38.151 --> 45:39.152
This one here.

45:40.931 --> 45:42.344
It is silk.

45:42.545 --> 45:45.339
Indeed loses transparency
in dark areas ...

45:45.540 --> 45:47.220
But the light is better.

45:47.621 --> 45:49.413
Yes? Great.

45:50.115 --> 45:51.575
It's very cool.

45:51.576 --> 45:53.891
Bras have different colors
for this model.

45:54.092 --> 45:55.093
- I can see?
- Yes.

45:57.659 --> 46:00.348
Here you go ... in gold,
black, and meat.

46:00.549 --> 46:01.550
The black.

46:01.853 --> 46:04.384
It's not for everyone but
for Kyra will be sublime.

46:05.971 --> 46:07.173
Do you want to try it?

46:08.967 --> 46:10.342
Come.

46:27.528 --> 46:28.528
I waited.

46:33.621 --> 46:35.447
<b> I suggest a game </b>

46:39.073 --> 46:42.888
<b> I hate games </b>

46:45.572 --> 46:46.743
Sorry.

47:07.340 --> 47:08.728
You want to try on the dress?

47:09.862 --> 47:10.780
Do not.

47:10.881 --> 47:12.955
I'll take two colors
for her to choose.

47:13.156 --> 47:14.158
Great.

47:14.159 --> 47:15.452
Well, I take it off.

47:25.902 --> 47:28.388
<b> is not a game is more </b>

47:45.730 --> 47:48.836
<b> What is the meaning? </b>

49:52.426 --> 49:53.746
I'm on the train give me a second.

49:56.532 --> 49:58.427
Tonight I was in a business.

49:59.411 --> 50:00.723
When are you coming back?

50:04.590 --> 50:07.015
Tomorrow early afternoon.

50:07.216 --> 50:09.703
Okay, I finish and leave.

50:10.251 --> 50:12.996
I have to go to Cartier, the jewelry,
but everything is ready.

50:17.015 --> 50:19.759
Detente a distributor of Roissy.

50:19.794 --> 50:20.794
But if not.

50:20.828 --> 50:24.108
Ask the driver to stop at an ATM
that is in the city of CRG.

50:24.303 --> 50:25.837
And in less than two seconds ...

50:32.694 --> 50:34.152
They were $ 400.00

50:34.153 --> 50:35.555
They said $ 400.00

50:38.293 --> 50:40.950
They get tax note.

50:45.769 --> 50:47.086
See you.

50:58.646 --> 51:01.354
<b> Yesterday I tried the shoes of
the woman with whom I work </b>

51:04.281 --> 51:07.077
<b> Why do you say that? </b>

51:18.648 --> 51:20.030
<b> not try them because she left </b>

51:26.581 --> 51:29.293
<b> So the answer is
prohibited? </b>

51:47.329 --> 51:49.925
<b> There is no desire if not prohibited </b>

51:52.966 --> 51:54.886
<b> What else is prohibited? </b>

52:08.007 --> 52:10.279
<b> Answered my question? </b>

52:17.787 --> 52:20.362
<b> Yes </b>

53:48.646 --> 53:49.803
<b> Already back? </b>

53:51.767 --> 53:53.537
<b> Yes </b>

53:58.155 --> 53:59.977
<b> Your home? </b>

54:04.625 --> 54:06.344
<b> A house Kyra? </b>

54:09.326 --> 54:12.078
<b> How do you know? </b>

54:15.439 --> 54:18.344
<b> Want to try on dresses Kyra? </b>

54:26.065 --> 54:27.936
<b> Yes. </b>

54:30.795 --> 54:33.416
<b> Because they are banned? </b>

54:40.256 --> 54:41.366
Fuck.

55:03.272 --> 55:08.438
<b> Kyra's Gellman + anFAR +

58:41.662 --> 58:43.423

58:53.200 --> 58:55.113
<b> Are you scared? </b>

58:59.811 --> 59:02.871
<b> Yes, yes I am </b>

59:06.275 --> 59:09.116

pm, fourth number 724 </b>

01:01:23.372 --> 01:01:24.763
How are you?

01:01:24.964 --> 01:01:27.110
Are you sure the spirit is gone?

01:01:27.312 --> 01:01:29.113
Yes.

01:01:29.114 --> 01:01:31.047
He vomited this ectoplasm.

01:01:31.648 --> 01:01:32.969
And he left.

01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:37.744
I only saw her for a minute
or so and disappeared.

01:01:38.445 --> 01:01:40.609
You have an idea of
​​what you wanted?

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:44.405
She is very angry
and very violent.

01:01:45.326 --> 01:01:47.071
She might be something.

01:01:47.763 --> 01:01:49.215
He looked lost.

01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:54.544
Do not think back, I do not think
it will be there again.

01:01:59.984 --> 01:02:01.916
And what about Lewis?

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.932
Ay have been 295 days.

01:02:10.081 --> 01:02:12.235
Jerome and Cassamdra buy me the house.

01:02:16.474 --> 01:02:17.614
All right.

01:02:22.532 --> 01:02:26.249
Lewis really loved them,
so it will be perfect.

01:02:29.025 --> 01:02:30.453
How about you?

01:02:35.063 --> 01:02:36.234
What will you do with the money?

01:02:36.835 --> 01:02:38.037
Nothing.

01:02:39.094 --> 01:02:40.493
Nothing?

01:02:41.825 --> 01:02:43.193
I do not know.

01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:45.817
I'm not ready to buy something else.

01:02:46.469 --> 01:02:48.595
I strive to secure the future.

01:02:51.655 --> 01:02:52.666
I feel you.

01:02:54.426 --> 01:02:56.306
I do not think you understand.

01:02:57.570 --> 01:03:00.404
I do not need to understand.
Trust me.

01:03:07.031 --> 01:03:08.703
I met someone.

01:03:10.284 --> 01:03:12.479
More or less, how, you?

01:03:18.381 --> 01:03:20.123
You must know before.

01:03:21.058 --> 01:03:25.916
By Keiroff, he is the
friend of a friend.

01:03:31.005 --> 01:03:33.453
After Lewis died ...

01:03:33.654 --> 01:03:36.050
He approached me and approached.

01:03:40.415 --> 01:03:42.011
Were you impressed?

01:03:42.212 --> 01:03:43.814
No, it's okay, that's good.

01:03:44.515 --> 01:03:46.279
I did not expect that, but ...

01:03:46.481 --> 01:03:47.865
Of course.

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:52.304
I will always amar a Lewis, I can
not spend my life in mourning ...

01:03:53.206 --> 01:03:55.370
The pain does not interest me ...

01:03:55.571 --> 01:03:57.853
suffering and pain is very hard.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.311
I think I like my life now.

01:04:31.416 --> 01:04:33.080
The other day he told ...

01:04:33.408 --> 01:04:36.048
Victor mentioned some kind of communication
with spirits ...

01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:37.377
or something, what he meant ...

01:04:37.401 --> 01:04:38.512
You mean he was talking
to them?

01:04:38.536 --> 01:04:39.337
How is that?

01:04:39.538 --> 01:04:40.689
In exile in Jersey ...

01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:42.098
They would change the tables.

01:04:42.099 --> 01:04:45.935
And they are talking of historical people?

01:04:46.036 --> 01:04:48.177
And ... Bible.

01:04:48.537 --> 01:04:50.049
He explained there.

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:51.250
How is that?

01:04:51.753 --> 01:04:53.013
How that?

01:04:54.418 --> 01:04:55.958
I do not know how...

01:04:55.959 --> 01:04:58.752
No, I say verbal, did
alphabetically?

01:04:58.954 --> 01:05:02.571
No, no, no they are dealing with the
alphabet, but the spirits merged.

01:05:03.873 --> 01:05:04.873
So what did they do?

01:05:05.423 --> 01:05:07.150
With a spiritual table ...

01:05:07.351 --> 01:05:08.758
wooden leg hits the floor.

01:05:08.782 --> 01:05:11.158
A blow "if" and two strokes for a "no".

01:05:12.221 --> 01:05:16.394
One for A, two for B, and something
like 26 times to "Z".

01:05:16.796 --> 01:05:18.836
But you must take an incredible
amount of time.

01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:21.869
Yes, pages and pages of transcripts.

01:05:23.554 --> 01:05:25.015
That sounds stupid.
That is not true.

01:05:25.016 --> 01:05:27.189
- I do not know. - That
can not happen.

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:29.177
No, you have to believe in this.

01:05:29.378 --> 01:05:31.465
It was not intended for publication ...

01:05:31.666 --> 01:05:32.843
Why invent?

01:05:32.944 --> 01:05:37.594
I think the transcriber could
not fill in the blanks.

01:05:37.795 --> 01:05:39.389
It sounds like shorthand.

01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:41.398
- I think. - That's
a good analogy.

01:05:41.799 --> 01:05:46.364
If you are interested there is a TV series
of the 60's. Sessions are described.

01:05:47.478 --> 01:05:49.747
It is crap but it seems true.

01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:52.164
I can find the title ...

01:05:52.165 --> 01:05:57.219
He writes: "+ Jersey gaming tables,

- Sorry.

01:10:49.366 --> 01:10:53.081
I need to know a name of the room 724.

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:55.281
Well, give me a second.

01:10:55.483 --> 01:10:57.647
Let's see ... 724.

01:10:58.896 --> 01:11:00.278
It is...

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.237
It is Maureen Cartwright.

01:11:05.404 --> 01:11:06.538
I'm Maureen Cartwright.

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.041
Who paid for the room?

01:11:08.242 --> 01:11:09.526
Give me a second.

01:11:11.529 --> 01:11:13.929
Sorry, we have no information
credit card ...

01:11:14.043 --> 01:11:16.420
They paid in advance and in cash.

01:11:17.704 --> 01:11:19.463
Do you remember whether it was male or female?

01:11:19.764 --> 01:11:21.397
I'm sorry, I was not at that time.

01:11:21.598 --> 01:11:23.702
You did not know who was?

01:11:23.903 --> 01:11:27.466
This is a large hotel would
not know how to help ...

01:11:37.597 --> 01:11:38.612
Thank you.

01:11:38.814 --> 01:11:40.214
- See you later.
- Bye.

01:11:53.299 --> 01:11:55.786
This is a selection of 5 pieces ...

01:11:55.987 --> 01:11:59.795
Necklace "Pont des Arts" of the
"Paris New Wave" collection.

01:11:59.996 --> 01:12:03.165
18 karat gold and and
five gemstones.

01:12:03.266 --> 01:12:07.201
Yes, perfect, necklace, bracelet,
ring and watch.

01:12:07.302 --> 01:12:08.874
But that, he did not ask.

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:10.142
Good perfect.

01:12:10.343 --> 01:12:11.623
So let's focus on this.

01:12:11.733 --> 01:12:13.528
- All right. - I have everything
ready for you.

01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:14.730
- Thank you. - You're
welcome.

01:12:18.064 --> 01:12:19.980
All this is new, it has
not hit the market yet.

01:12:20.182 --> 01:12:21.283
It's an exclusive.

01:12:21.484 --> 01:12:24.548
Oh, okay, is very important,
thank you.

01:13:05.907 --> 01:13:07.257
¿Kyra, you're back?

01:13:12.564 --> 01:13:16.203
I'm sorry I forgot my phone, I
leave these bags here, okay?

01:13:21.268 --> 01:13:22.614
Heavens.

01:13:35.034 --> 01:13:36.421
¿Kyra, are you okay?

01:16:13.018 --> 01:16:14.470
Follow me please.

01:16:21.727 --> 01:16:25.424
I left it there for two minutes ...

01:16:25.626 --> 01:16:29.479
perhaps before we start, I turned
around and called him.

01:16:30.823 --> 01:16:32.942
Why did not you done before?

01:16:38.077 --> 01:16:40.706
I got paranoid ...

01:16:42.867 --> 01:16:44.020
I fled.

01:16:44.878 --> 01:16:47.510
You ran away from the scene.

01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:51.827
It was light ...

01:16:54.094 --> 01:16:56.166
in the back of the apartment
I heard something.

01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:57.190
That's how it went.

01:16:57.643 --> 01:16:59.963
What were you doing at the
house of señora Gellman's?

01:17:00.753 --> 01:17:02.371
I dropped a couple of bags.

01:17:03.935 --> 01:17:05.352
I do not understand.

01:17:05.753 --> 01:17:07.943
I am a "personal shopper"

01:17:08.143 --> 01:17:11.454
She is a very popular person
of good profile ...

01:17:12.256 --> 01:17:14.296
so you do not have time
to do practical things.

01:17:14.566 --> 01:17:17.818
So I help.

01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:27.655
Did you use her computer
last night?

01:17:28.056 --> 01:17:29.564
Maybe, I do not remember.

01:17:29.865 --> 01:17:31.184
And again in the morning.

01:17:32.286 --> 01:17:35.062
Did you check your emails?

01:17:36.176 --> 01:17:38.183
We have history.

01:17:40.598 --> 01:17:41.601
What is the question?

01:17:42.247 --> 01:17:43.979
You slept in your house?

01:17:46.752 --> 01:17:47.776
That if you slept at home!

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.709
Yes, I accept, I slept at home.

01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:51.011
Why?

01:17:55.993 --> 01:18:00.148
I do not know, to be honest
I had never done that.

01:18:00.349 --> 01:18:01.598
Why hide it?

01:18:03.602 --> 01:18:05.148
It was a stupid reaction.

01:18:06.251 --> 01:18:09.499
Perhaps I was a bit embarrassing.

01:18:14.055 --> 01:18:16.696
Did she would be at home today?

01:18:16.697 --> 01:18:19.437
Yes, he told me that he
would return to Milan.

01:18:19.438 --> 01:18:20.886
And she is returning to Marrakech.

01:18:22.721 --> 01:18:25.090
And I was witnessing a
thin, her accessories.

01:18:25.762 --> 01:18:27.018
¿Fine accessories?

01:18:28.161 --> 01:18:29.353
Jewelry.

01:18:29.855 --> 01:18:30.946
What kind of jewelry?

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:35.693
An expensive Cartier jewelry.

01:18:37.665 --> 01:18:39.090
And he left them there?

01:18:40.995 --> 01:18:44.159
Yes, 4 boxes and two bags.

01:18:44.812 --> 01:18:46.518
Were you there when he returned?

01:18:47.721 --> 01:18:49.743
I do not know, I was ...

I'm sorry for having awakened.

01:19:45.918 --> 01:19:51.900
No, I was just trying out
new security protocols.

01:19:52.101 --> 01:19:55.758

01:20:03.219 --> 01:20:04.331
You quit?

01:20:06.421 --> 01:20:07.966
Yes, that will not happen.

01:20:08.968 --> 01:20:11.856
Maureen, not that this does not happen ...

01:20:11.857 --> 01:20:13.953
but it does not exist.

01:20:14.455 --> 01:20:15.691

01:20:16.693 --> 01:20:17.899
There is nothing.

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.342
Yes I know.

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:22.228
It is not a big problem.

01:20:22.630 --> 01:20:24.852
I said you had a wait ...

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:26.791

01:20:27.293 --> 01:20:28.771

01:20:30.226 --> 01:20:31.699

01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:33.528

01:20:35.555 --> 01:20:37.246
I do not want to be here anymore.

01:20:37.447 --> 01:20:39.178
I will no longer be in Paris.

01:20:41.410 --> 01:20:42.545
I miss you.

01:20:43.296 --> 01:20:44.802
I miss you too.

01:20:46.625 --> 01:20:47.793
Y...

01:20:47.995 --> 01:20:50.620

01:20:52.923 --> 01:20:53.924
and you join me.

01:20:54.526 --> 01:20:58.248

on what the police say.

01:21:00.673 --> 01:21:02.480

01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:16.986

01:21:19.185 --> 01:21:20.289

01:21:22.385 --> 01:21:24.768
I do not want to talk about
that anymore. It is awful.

- Good day.

Are you the sister of Lewis?

01:28:18.732 --> 01:28:20.293
Yes it is.

01:28:21.024 --> 01:28:22.645
We were together at Ecole Boulle.

01:28:23.046 --> 01:28:25.807

I understand that you feel uncomfortable.

01:28:47.099 --> 01:28:48.778
Why?

01:28:48.979 --> 01:28:51.601
Because I kept the place of Lewis.

01:28:52.102 --> 01:28:53.210
Coming Soon.

01:28:53.412 --> 01:28:54.413
Not at all.

01:28:55.577 --> 01:28:56.577
You're wrong.

01:28:58.806 --> 01:29:02.584
During his life there was nothing
between Lara and me.

01:29:04.001 --> 01:29:06.753
I was not crossed my
mind. Honestly.

01:29:09.098 --> 01:29:12.863
You know when they say: "The
dead observe the living."

01:29:14.291 --> 01:29:15.962
I've been thinking.

01:29:16.463 --> 01:29:19.147
Not only because Lewis was
talking to the dead.

01:29:20.171 --> 01:29:21.595
I do not know what that means.

01:29:24.126 --> 01:29:25.620
For me, it was especially ...

01:29:25.721 --> 01:29:28.111
a deep intuition of others.

01:29:29.927 --> 01:29:32.784
They included things unsaid.

01:29:33.710 --> 01:29:34.820
It is true.

01:29:36.055 --> 01:29:39.235
Perhaps because he knew he was dying.

01:29:40.037 --> 01:29:43.832
I mean ... I felt I saw ...

01:29:47.050 --> 01:29:48.726
things you could not see.

01:29:49.228 --> 01:29:51.738
He thought have the same quality.

01:29:52.502 --> 01:29:53.523
I do not know.

01:29:54.384 --> 01:29:55.704
I...

01:29:56.962 --> 01:29:58.973
I used to follow him.

01:30:00.221 --> 01:30:02.378
But he went.

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.434
Too far for me.

01:30:04.435 --> 01:30:05.436
At least.

01:30:05.838 --> 01:30:07.436
You can not ...

01:30:08.304 --> 01:30:10.079
That is, with Lewis ...

01:30:11.284 --> 01:30:12.956
nothing seems impossible.

01:30:15.052 --> 01:30:18.411
Many religions believe that the
souls haunt the time ...

01:30:18.612 --> 01:30:20.625
before leaving this world.

01:30:20.927 --> 01:30:22.328
Did he speak like that?

01:30:22.854 --> 01:30:24.202
He was convinced of that.

01:30:32.588 --> 01:30:34.715
After Mom died ...

01:30:34.917 --> 01:30:37.024
He was sure ...

01:30:38.026 --> 01:30:42.182
which was visited by her,
I said goodbye to him ...

01:30:42.555 --> 01:30:44.043
It was like a dream ... but.

01:30:44.244 --> 01:30:46.180
It was not real.

01:30:46.181 --> 01:30:49.072
He could smell her, see her curly hair.

01:30:50.929 --> 01:30:52.293
Do you believe that?

01:30:52.845 --> 01:30:54.181
Yes, I do believe.

01:30:55.279 --> 01:30:56.795
No religious ...

01:30:57.096 --> 01:30:59.994
but, I think.

01:31:01.111 --> 01:31:02.740
Do you think Lewis is here?

01:31:06.876 --> 01:31:07.876
I do not know.

01:31:11.257 --> 01:31:12.486
I do not think so.

01:31:16.384 --> 01:31:18.163
I feel his presence.

01:31:19.488 --> 01:31:20.910
Is here.

01:31:23.339 --> 01:31:25.274
Maybe I feel guilty when speaking.

01:31:26.205 --> 01:31:28.160
Tell me if there is reason to feel guilty.

01:31:29.519 --> 01:31:32.132
Lara deserves to be happy.

01:31:32.734 --> 01:31:33.863
And you too.

01:31:34.783 --> 01:31:36.427
I believe it, but ...

01:31:38.038 --> 01:31:39.587
But something stops me.

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:41.975
Not, I hope.

01:31:42.298 --> 01:31:43.320
Do not.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.137
But you must also rid of Lewis.

01:31:50.661 --> 01:31:51.894
