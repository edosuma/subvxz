Hey, Frank.

20:36.542 --> 20:39.583
<i>Sometimes you make a decision</i>
<i>and feel sure you did the right thing.</i>

20:39.583 --> 20:42.000
Hey, Todd. I'm glad I caught you.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.625
I just wanna tell you
that if you want to go out with Willow

20:44.625 --> 20:46.875
then you have my blessing.

20:47.542 --> 20:50.041
Well. Thank you.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.583
And what if I wanted to go out with her
the last two nights

20:52.583 --> 20:53.875
and part of this morning?

20:55.917 --> 20:57.333
Namaste.

20:57.792 --> 20:59.667
- All right.
- Okay.

20:59.667 --> 21:02.709
<i>But sometimes, you can't help</i>
<i>but to think a little bit</i>

21:02.709 --> 21:05.333
<i>about the choices you've cut loose.</i>

21:08.750 --> 21:10.375
[COIN CLINKS]

21:10.375 --> 21:13.667
Don't pick it up
until we find out if it's heads or--

21:14.333 --> 21:16.875
No. Let's not find out.

21:16.875 --> 21:18.500
Shh.
