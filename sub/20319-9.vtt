Winner takes all.
All or nothing. alright?

00:30.092 --> 00:31.392
<i>Yeah that's not
going to happen.</i>

00:43.037 --> 00:43.971
You all right?

00:44.038 --> 00:45.072
Yeah.

00:46.374 --> 00:48.909
Well at least
I didn't score.

00:48.977 --> 00:51.544
Clark.

00:53.081 --> 00:54.882
Yes sir.

00:54.949 --> 00:57.083
That's fantastic; I'll
be there in fifteen.

00:57.150 --> 00:58.517
What's that?

00:58.585 --> 00:59.718
We just got our first big
break on these computer

00:59.786 --> 01:01.220
thieves we've been
after for six months.

01:01.288 --> 01:02.654
Guys who steal...

01:02.722 --> 01:03.756
No, no, hackers, hackers.

01:03.823 --> 01:05.123
Hackers over on
the dark side.

01:05.191 --> 01:06.492
Yeah.

01:06.559 --> 01:07.593
Well it's a big game for
those guys isn't it?

01:07.660 --> 01:10.363
Yeah it is till
someone gets greedy.

01:10.430 --> 01:11.364
Well that's it?

01:11.431 --> 01:12.431
I'm done.

01:12.499 --> 01:13.765
I gotta go to work.

01:13.832 --> 01:15.066
Good game man, that's fun.

01:17.003 --> 01:18.603
You love this
stuff don't you?

01:18.670 --> 01:21.439
It reminds me when I was coming
up, stuff we used to pull.

01:21.507 --> 01:23.141
What are these
guys up to now?

01:23.209 --> 01:25.443
They've been picking off one
financial site after another.

01:25.511 --> 01:27.612
They get in so deep that they
become the system administrator,

01:27.613 --> 01:29.947
then they can hack credit card
numbers at will.

01:30.015 --> 01:31.248
Someone's trying to
break in right now.

01:36.688 --> 01:37.822
Gotcha.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.557
Let's move;
I'll meet you out front.

01:39.558 --> 01:40.558
Okay.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.026
Look I don't have that
kind of cash right now.

01:42.093 --> 01:43.060
It would just
be till payday.

01:43.128 --> 01:44.429
No, dude, listen.

01:44.496 --> 01:46.024
Come on; I just bought a
motor bike, I don't have

01:46.025 --> 01:47.964
extra cash floating
around, you know.

01:47.965 --> 01:49.965
Look if you don't trust
me, just read up here...

01:50.033 --> 01:51.568
It's not that I
don't trust you...

01:51.636 --> 01:53.670
You short of some
cash Mr. Bey?

01:53.738 --> 01:56.239
No sir, I'm just a little
over extended, that's all.

01:56.307 --> 01:58.041
Well maybe I can
help you out.

01:58.108 --> 02:00.143
Oh... I don't think you
should lend me money sir.

02:00.210 --> 02:01.711
I didn't say I was going
to lend you any money Mr. Bey.

02:01.779 --> 02:02.779
Okay.

02:02.780 --> 02:05.014
Look you guys are about to
do a change in shift. right?

02:05.082 --> 02:08.550
Yeah, yeah, we got four
days off in a row.

02:08.618 --> 02:11.286
Well how about you think about
taking on some extra shifts, huh?

02:11.304 --> 02:14.021
Maybe because I got this recruit
from Barrie, you know...

02:14.022 --> 02:16.192
She's looking to do ride-along,
get her accreditations.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.593
What do you think?

02:17.661 --> 02:18.094
I don't know, I...

02:18.100 --> 02:20.395
Working with new recruits, that's
not really my forte you know,

02:20.463 --> 02:21.463
- I'm not really the teaching type.
- Yeah.

02:21.530 --> 02:22.764
Uh huh. Yeah.

02:22.832 --> 02:23.865
I think that I'd probably
end up doing them

02:23.933 --> 02:25.367
a disservice, to be
honest with you.

02:25.368 --> 02:26.970
Her name's Elise.

02:28.037 --> 02:29.271
Yeah, I'll do it.

02:29.272 --> 02:30.072
You sure?

02:30.073 --> 02:31.373
Yeah, yeah, I'll do it.

02:31.441 --> 02:32.441
Yeah I could use
the money too.

02:32.508 --> 02:33.508
No I'll do it...

02:33.576 --> 02:34.608
Toby volunteered...

02:34.676 --> 02:37.144
- I'll totally do it.
- He's got days off.

02:52.259 --> 02:53.926
Hey what's up man?

02:53.995 --> 02:55.228
Do I know you?

02:55.296 --> 02:56.929
No, but I know you.

02:56.998 --> 02:58.365
I don't think so.

02:58.432 --> 03:00.933
Yeah, your computer's beaming
some pretty nasty signals up there.

03:01.002 --> 03:02.802
Thought you guys were
smarter than that.

03:04.038 --> 03:05.372
Really gonna make me...

03:20.153 --> 03:21.286
Ah...oh...

03:47.845 --> 03:49.179
He sure spooked easy.

03:49.247 --> 03:51.580
Well maybe he didn't want to be
found in possession of these.

03:52.648 --> 03:53.415
Blank credit cards.

03:53.518 --> 03:55.317
There's got to be ten
thousand in here.

03:59.010 --> 04:05.610
<font color="#FF8C00">Sync & corrections by Alice</font>
<font color="##FF8C00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:12.281 --> 04:13.714
So how's he doing?

04:13.781 --> 04:15.649
It's probably just a
sprained ankle but we'll

04:15.717 --> 04:16.983
get some x-rays
done to be sure.

04:17.051 --> 04:18.685
Did the car door hurt him?

04:18.753 --> 04:20.120
Hm... hurt him?

04:20.187 --> 04:22.689
Well, he's got a severe
case of bruised ego.

04:22.757 --> 04:24.324
Worst case I've ever seen.

04:24.392 --> 04:25.359
Can we talk to him?

04:25.426 --> 04:26.727
Sure, go ahead.

04:29.929 --> 04:32.298
Benny, Benny, Benny, next
time you pull a stunt like

04:32.366 --> 04:34.500
that you might not just
sprain an ankle man.

04:34.568 --> 04:35.768
Who told you my name?

04:35.835 --> 04:36.935
Oh this is official.

04:37.003 --> 04:38.638
You popped up on
the radar at IIB.

04:38.705 --> 04:41.106
Why don't you tell us about
that bag of credit cards?

04:41.174 --> 04:42.575
Belongs to a friend of a
friend, asked me to hold

04:42.643 --> 04:44.143
on to it for him.

04:44.210 --> 04:45.510
Well if those cards are
encoded with stolen credit

04:45.578 --> 04:47.479
card numbers you could be
charged with possession of

04:47.546 --> 04:48.846
stolen property.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.181
If...?

04:50.249 --> 04:52.284
If they weren't
then why did you run?

04:53.653 --> 04:55.787
All right, this friend of
a friend; does he have a name?

04:55.854 --> 04:59.123
Probably, yeah.

04:59.191 --> 05:00.191
Mind if I take this?

05:00.259 --> 05:01.725
Yeah.

05:04.796 --> 05:07.264
Look kid, I don't know what
you got yourself mixed up in,

05:07.332 --> 05:09.767
but it may be a little more
serious than you think.

05:09.834 --> 05:10.934
Are you going
to charge me?

05:11.002 --> 05:12.102
I haven't decided yet.

05:12.170 --> 05:13.804
Then we're done talking.

05:22.346 --> 05:23.680
He's got a bit
of an attitude.

05:23.747 --> 05:25.281
It's all right,
I know the type.

05:25.348 --> 05:27.049
Thanks for stopping
by before you left.

05:27.117 --> 05:28.750
No problem.

05:28.819 --> 05:30.352
He's telling the truth about
holding cards for his friend.

05:30.420 --> 05:32.421
There's something else on his
mind; something bigger.

05:32.488 --> 05:34.089
A guy named Jericho 11.

05:34.157 --> 05:35.291
Jericho 11?

05:35.358 --> 05:36.992
Yeah, you know him?

05:37.060 --> 05:38.460
Yeah the name just popped
up recently but I wasn't

05:38.528 --> 05:39.261
sure if it was a real
person or an invention.

05:39.329 --> 05:41.229
It's very real to him.

05:41.297 --> 05:44.398
So you said you have
the next four days off?

05:44.466 --> 05:46.134
I'm guessing not anymore?

05:50.405 --> 05:52.673
Thank God you're here.

05:52.741 --> 05:54.475
Come on, please hurry.

05:55.744 --> 05:57.377
Okay. What are we
looking at here?

05:57.478 --> 05:58.879
We were just getting ready
to start the ceremony,

05:58.947 --> 06:00.147
everybody is
in their seats.

06:00.215 --> 06:01.215
I think she's having
a arart attack.

06:01.282 --> 06:02.649
Okay, all right.

06:02.717 --> 06:06.186
Can you just get her up here?
Here we go... have a seat.

06:06.254 --> 06:09.323
Okay. Alright.
What's your name?

06:09.390 --> 06:10.490
Alicia.

06:10.558 --> 06:11.725
Alicia, okay.

06:11.792 --> 06:13.092
Alicia, I'm Oz and
this is Elise.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.493
Can you tell me what
you're feeling?

06:14.594 --> 06:16.128
My chest is tight,
I can't breathe.

06:16.196 --> 06:19.531
Her grandmother died of
heart failure when she was 83.

06:19.599 --> 06:23.669
Okay, we have shortness of
breath, heart palpitations...

06:23.737 --> 06:24.837
BP is 140/90.

06:24.905 --> 06:26.172
Okay. Just take a
slow deep breath.

06:26.240 --> 06:29.807
Let's all take a nice
slow deep breath.

06:29.876 --> 06:32.077
Okay ma'am are you
experiencing any pain,

06:32.144 --> 06:34.246
numbness...
is your vision blurred.

06:34.313 --> 06:36.281
Okay.

06:36.349 --> 06:37.715
I think she's stroking out...

06:37.783 --> 06:38.583
No, no you're not having
a stroke

06:38.584 --> 06:39.885
and you're not having
a heart attack.

06:39.952 --> 06:41.486
But I have seen this
condition before;

06:41.553 --> 06:45.157
I believe the technical term
is <i>pied froid</i> ?

06:45.553 --> 06:46.757
Cold feet?

06:46.791 --> 06:49.326
Alright? You're a little nervous
maybe, and who wouldn't be?

06:49.394 --> 06:50.794
You know what it's
your big day....

06:50.862 --> 06:53.330
You got like 500
people in there.

06:53.398 --> 06:55.499
you probably got mom yak, yak, yak
in your ear all day.

06:55.566 --> 06:57.468
So let's just think about

06:57.510 --> 07:00.037
how you felt when he
proposed to you.

07:00.105 --> 07:01.704
What's the young
man's name?

07:01.772 --> 07:03.172
- Ryan.
- Ryan.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.440
Ok... I bet he took
you somewhere really nice.

07:04.508 --> 07:05.942
- Rome.
- Rome!

07:06.010 --> 07:08.077
I was thinking more
like The Keg, but okay,

07:08.078 --> 07:10.380
you're in Rome and you
got butterflies in your

07:10.447 --> 07:12.516
stomach and your heart
is racing.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.483
And those are
the real feelings.

07:14.551 --> 07:16.752
Just take one
more deep breath.

07:18.388 --> 07:20.155
Okay now if anything else
comes up, if you guys need

07:20.156 --> 07:21.189
anything else
you can give us a call

07:21.257 --> 07:22.524
but I think you're
going to be just fine.

07:23.091 --> 07:23.758
Thank you.

07:24.326 --> 07:25.727
Ma'am I need you
to sign this.

07:25.795 --> 07:27.361
And you know what; if it
doesn't work out in there

07:27.430 --> 07:28.363
then you can
give me a call.

07:28.431 --> 07:29.364
I'm kidding, obviously.

07:29.432 --> 07:30.365
That's very inappropriate.

07:30.433 --> 07:31.833
Come on.

07:31.901 --> 07:33.301
Don't forget this...

07:33.368 --> 07:35.736
- Thank you.
- Throw that at somebody.

07:35.804 --> 07:37.504
Okay...

07:40.042 --> 07:43.077
Wow, I completely misread
her and you nailed it.

07:43.145 --> 07:44.745
Oh, this is why
you're here.

07:44.813 --> 07:47.081
There's only so much you can
learn in the classroom, right?

07:47.149 --> 07:49.349
I like your
bedside manner.

07:51.585 --> 07:53.920
So neither Cyber crimes or
Financial has anything

07:53.988 --> 07:55.021
on this Jericho 11?

07:55.089 --> 07:56.156
Nothing.

07:56.223 --> 07:57.123
And what about
the credit cards?

07:57.191 --> 07:58.458
All blank.

07:58.525 --> 07:59.826
And the computer he used
to track them with?

07:59.893 --> 08:02.628
It was wiped clean by a cell phone
command before we got to it.

08:02.696 --> 08:04.831
Then we got nothing;
we can't charge him.

08:04.898 --> 08:07.266
Well actually we've
had a surveillance team

08:07.334 --> 08:09.634
following Benny since
he left the hospital.

08:09.702 --> 08:12.304
I was really hoping that
it would lead us to Jericho 11...

08:12.372 --> 08:14.139
Oh good, and?

08:14.207 --> 08:17.142
He met someone very
interesting...

08:22.414 --> 08:24.583
Huh... who is she?

08:24.650 --> 08:25.951
Marisa Patterson.

08:26.018 --> 08:28.186
Cyber crime knows her as
'hack girl'.

08:28.753 --> 08:29.521
She is a blogger.

08:29.589 --> 08:32.155
She is sort of the
Perez Hilton of hacking.

08:32.224 --> 08:33.592
She writes about you

08:33.659 --> 08:34.860
and you're a hacker
then you know you've made it.

08:34.927 --> 08:36.327
She is very
anti-authority, big chip

08:36.395 --> 08:37.628
on her shoulder.

08:37.696 --> 08:39.697
Could she be Jericho 11?

08:39.764 --> 08:43.232
Doubt it, but she
may know who is.

08:43.301 --> 08:44.702
Problem is she
protects her sources.

08:44.769 --> 08:46.804
There's no way she's going
to give up his identity;

08:46.872 --> 08:48.205
especially to a
bunch of cops.

08:48.272 --> 08:50.808
I think we should get
someone next to her.

08:53.077 --> 08:54.478
Let's do it.

08:54.545 --> 08:56.679
You know I do not see you
as a hacker my friend.

08:56.747 --> 08:58.248
You can barely program
your own cell phone.

08:58.316 --> 08:59.649
They briefed
me, so I'm good.

08:59.717 --> 09:01.118
All right...

09:01.185 --> 09:02.986
Puck right in the side...
gets it out in front...

09:03.054 --> 09:04.654
Leman stirring
away on a breakaway...

09:04.722 --> 09:06.356
shooting...
he scores!

09:06.424 --> 09:08.558
Oh holy Mackinaw!

09:08.626 --> 09:10.326
My goalie's... look stuck.

09:10.394 --> 09:13.862
Okay man... but you can
play with a stuck goalie.

09:13.930 --> 09:15.231
I just know where
you're going...

09:15.298 --> 09:17.099
- ... with the puck.
- Oh you do do you? Come on.

09:17.167 --> 09:18.800
You think you're the only
psychic in the house?

09:18.868 --> 09:19.801
How's the newbie?

09:19.869 --> 09:20.936
- What, Elise?
-Yeah.

09:21.004 --> 09:22.072
- She's interesting.
- Yeah?

09:22.480 --> 09:23.640
I'd call her <i>hot</i>.

09:23.650 --> 09:24.702
I wouldn't say
interesting...

09:24.708 --> 09:26.307
Listen Toby if you're
going to mess with these hackers

09:26.308 --> 09:29.877
they got their own language,
their own codes... ohh!!

09:29.945 --> 09:31.979
Oh dear; that is ugly.

09:32.048 --> 09:33.614
You can't fake it,
that's all I'm saying.

09:33.682 --> 09:35.183
No I got a cover story.

09:35.251 --> 09:38.053
They... I got a whole bunch
of credit card numbers

09:38.120 --> 09:42.189
and I need to pass them...
do you want to test me?

09:42.257 --> 09:43.357
Okay.

09:43.425 --> 09:46.260
Got it all worked out.

09:46.327 --> 09:51.631
Yes, so Mr. Logan how did you
come to acquire these numbers?

09:51.699 --> 09:54.634
Well I scoped a few
Point-of-Purchase terminals

09:54.702 --> 09:56.000
at a few businesses

09:57.052 --> 10:00.273
and I put a z-bot in
to access the servers...

10:00.340 --> 10:02.942
I hit a few keys and my bank
account gets fatter every day.

10:03.009 --> 10:04.009
Is that so?

10:04.078 --> 10:05.111
Yeah.

10:05.179 --> 10:06.612
What can I do for you?

10:06.680 --> 10:07.513
I was hoping you
could hook me up

10:07.581 --> 10:09.682
with someone in the
market for identities.

10:09.749 --> 10:11.317
Who would give
you that idea?

10:11.385 --> 10:13.486
A guy named Benny said you
could hook me up; help me out.

10:17.523 --> 10:20.924
I don't know who the hell you are
or what you've been told?

10:21.100 --> 10:22.727
But... you have me all wrong.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.620
Okay.

10:24.630 --> 10:27.199
I'm a blogger, I
write about hackers.

10:27.266 --> 10:29.934
And half of them don't make
a nickel for what they do.

10:30.002 --> 10:31.668
Are you offended
by what I do?

10:31.736 --> 10:34.438
No. It's worse than that.

10:34.506 --> 10:35.639
It bores me.

10:35.707 --> 10:37.274
Okay.

10:38.543 --> 10:42.012
Look I just... I didn't
mean to... Okay!

10:42.080 --> 10:43.880
Don't touch me.

10:43.948 --> 10:47.117
Sorry, I won't touch you.

10:47.184 --> 10:49.385
Do you know Jericho 11?

11:01.432 --> 11:04.266
I'm going to give you a
little piece of advice, okay?

11:04.334 --> 11:08.270
Bad things happen to people that
get involved with Jericho 11.

11:08.338 --> 11:11.806
Bad things.

11:21.646 --> 11:22.980
That's him.

11:23.548 --> 11:27.889
Yeah, that's the guy Hack Girl
saw when I mentioned Jericho 11.

11:30.955 --> 11:35.592
Peter Dukette,
25 years old.

11:35.659 --> 11:38.028
Dropped out of Queens
computer engineering after

11:38.096 --> 11:40.797
a term for a more
lucrative life in crime.

11:40.865 --> 11:43.333
Arrested for identity
theft, fraud.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.768
Suspected of numerous
counts of online impropriety.

11:45.836 --> 11:47.336
Looks like he
changed his ways.

11:47.403 --> 11:50.339
He runs a firm that tests
companies cyber security.

11:50.406 --> 11:52.341
There are some big
accounts here... GM, Ford,

11:52.408 --> 11:53.909
Canada Bank Financial...

11:53.977 --> 11:56.445
So these companies are
okay with a hacker like this?

11:56.512 --> 11:57.880
They trust him?

11:57.948 --> 11:59.281
Yeah hackers make the
best security consultants

11:59.349 --> 12:00.581
because they know
all the tricks.

12:00.649 --> 12:02.683
What about that hanging
guy that you saw?

12:02.752 --> 12:04.753
Not sure, that feels
like a suicide...

12:04.820 --> 12:06.120
And that equipment room?

12:06.187 --> 12:07.554
No idea.

12:07.622 --> 12:09.857
Maybe we need to see what
Mr. Dukette has to say.

12:09.924 --> 12:11.324
Yeah, you want
me to come along?

12:11.392 --> 12:13.260
No, Peter and Hacker
are on communication.

12:13.327 --> 12:15.562
I don't want them
connecting any dots just yet.

12:15.630 --> 12:17.131
I'll get my coat.

12:24.504 --> 12:26.338
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:26.406 --> 12:27.539
How you doing?

12:27.607 --> 12:28.607
Great. How's your
new partner?

12:28.675 --> 12:30.276
She's good, she's good.

12:30.343 --> 12:33.279
She's a little raw but I think
she's getting the hang of it.

12:33.346 --> 12:34.647
You free tonight?

12:34.714 --> 12:36.115
Sorry, I have plans.

12:36.183 --> 12:37.516
Okay, no problem.

12:37.584 --> 12:40.185
Are you free tomorrow,
maybe later in the week?

12:40.253 --> 12:43.755
Maybe, I have a few things
but... give me a call.

12:43.823 --> 12:45.190
Okay.

12:53.166 --> 12:54.598
My apologies for the mess,

12:54.666 --> 12:56.267
we cancelled the main
service when we wired in.

12:56.334 --> 12:58.903
Oh, Mr. Dukette you seem to
have done very well for

12:58.970 --> 13:01.705
yourself given your less
than stellar start.

13:01.773 --> 13:03.974
Well we all make mistakes
when we're young.

13:04.042 --> 13:06.944
Isn't that right Mr. Clark...
or is it Lockdown?

13:07.012 --> 13:08.846
That was back around
'97 though right?

13:08.914 --> 13:09.946
How many ?

13:10.014 --> 13:11.514
Four hundred and
twenty-five.

13:11.581 --> 13:14.617
Let me guess,
Shark 367 firewall.

13:14.685 --> 13:17.020
Now you're just
showing your age.

13:17.087 --> 13:20.356
I believe that you
know Benny here.

13:20.424 --> 13:21.590
Yeah, yeah I do.

13:21.658 --> 13:22.792
He's a very talented
programmer.

13:22.860 --> 13:23.993
He writes some
excellent code.

13:24.061 --> 13:25.361
What are they working on?

13:25.429 --> 13:26.995
They're testing a new
phone app security;

13:27.063 --> 13:29.031
it's a cross-site
scripting hole.

13:29.098 --> 13:30.232
Persistent or
non-persistent?

13:30.300 --> 13:31.633
Non-persistent.

13:31.701 --> 13:34.236
The developer thought that HTML
anti-decoding on 5 xml characters...

13:34.304 --> 13:35.904
Would be enough to
prevent the cross-site.

13:35.972 --> 13:37.272
Exactly.

13:37.340 --> 13:38.673
They're wrong and that's
how I make my money these

13:38.741 --> 13:41.109
days is by saving companies
from people like I...

13:41.177 --> 13:44.678
well we, used to be.

13:45.513 --> 13:47.949
Now... how may I help you?

13:48.016 --> 13:49.817
We're looking for someone
named Jericho 11.

13:49.885 --> 13:51.052
We believe this person
may be involved in

13:51.119 --> 13:53.054
a large-scale
identity theft.

13:53.121 --> 13:54.688
And why would you
think that I know him?

13:54.756 --> 13:56.958
Well unless I'm wrong you've
moved in the same circles.

13:57.025 --> 13:58.658
I don't associate with
those sorts anymore.

13:58.726 --> 14:01.027
I meant with your work.

14:01.095 --> 14:02.695
You are one of the good guys
now right, a white hat?

14:02.763 --> 14:04.630
They still
call them that?

14:04.698 --> 14:06.132
They do.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.534
No I haven't heard of this
individual but I do,

14:08.535 --> 14:10.170
I will be sure to let you know.

14:10.238 --> 14:13.406
We would appreciate that;
thank you for your time.

14:13.474 --> 14:15.007
Thank you.

14:21.081 --> 14:24.083
So Peter Dukette seems
to know a lot about you.

14:24.150 --> 14:26.685
You want to fill me in?

14:26.753 --> 14:29.755
Not especially.

14:29.822 --> 14:32.390
There's a reason that juvie
records are sealed Michelle.

14:32.457 --> 14:34.558
Dev, I know you've had
your run-ins with the law;

14:34.626 --> 14:37.695
I've never asked any
questions before, but...

14:37.763 --> 14:41.799
it's never affected a case.

14:41.867 --> 14:45.336
I got caught hacking into the
Department of Defense at 16.

14:45.404 --> 14:49.039
They offered me a deal,
either help with the RCMP

14:49.107 --> 14:50.673
or face the music.

14:50.741 --> 14:52.642
Turned out I liked
being a white hat.

14:52.710 --> 14:54.411
Well it sounds like
your legacy lives on.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.446
Once you're in cyber
space you live forever.

14:56.514 --> 14:57.915
I'm a digital artifact.

14:57.982 --> 14:59.283
And what about Dukette;
you think he is gone back

14:59.350 --> 15:00.384
to his old ways?

15:00.451 --> 15:01.618
Is he Jericho 11?

15:01.685 --> 15:03.819
Yeah?

15:03.887 --> 15:06.289
I don't know but we both
know he's hiding something.

15:06.356 --> 15:10.459
Okay, maybe it's time to
call our mind hacker...

15:10.527 --> 15:11.727
The one who doesn't
need a computer?

15:11.795 --> 15:13.095
Yeah.

15:15.966 --> 15:18.233
Basic tube in
to the base of the epiglottis

15:20.202 --> 15:23.038
...inflating cuff...

15:23.105 --> 15:27.108
securing tube... and time.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.109
Fifty-seven seconds.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.477
Yes!

15:29.545 --> 15:31.179
Beat that.

15:31.247 --> 15:32.880
I honestly don't think I can;
that is a very impressive time.

15:32.949 --> 15:33.981
Really?

15:34.049 --> 15:36.817
Yes, absolutely.
Good for you.

15:36.884 --> 15:38.285
Cool.

15:38.353 --> 15:43.123
Hey it's almost quitting
time; want to grab a beer?

15:43.191 --> 15:45.326
I can't tonight; I got
to get some work done.

15:45.393 --> 15:46.760
Thank you though.

15:46.828 --> 15:49.629
Oh, okay.

15:49.697 --> 15:51.397
How about tomorrow?

15:51.465 --> 15:52.898
It will be my treat...
I have per diem.

15:52.967 --> 15:55.634
- Per diem?    - Yeah
Wow!

16:11.718 --> 16:14.419
Hey, hi, it's me, sorry.

16:14.488 --> 16:15.855
What are you doing here?

16:15.922 --> 16:17.656
I want to talk to you
without getting stabbed.

16:17.724 --> 16:18.891
What do you want?

16:18.959 --> 16:20.526
I need your help.

16:20.594 --> 16:23.027
All right, the truth is
my name is Lars Trenton.

16:23.095 --> 16:25.530
I'm head of security at
a data storage company.

16:25.598 --> 16:28.766
We got hacked, someone
stole credit card information.

16:28.834 --> 16:30.902
I think the person who did it,
his name is Jericho 11,

16:30.970 --> 16:32.470
I need you to
help me find him.

16:32.538 --> 16:35.540
I already told you I don't
know who the guy is, okay?

16:35.608 --> 16:37.509
And why should I help you;
you lied to me.

16:37.576 --> 16:39.810
You lied to me.

16:39.878 --> 16:43.446
You're not just a blogger,
you're one of them.

16:43.515 --> 16:44.815
Right.

16:44.883 --> 16:46.316
All right, so how do you
know so much about them;

16:46.384 --> 16:47.718
how do you know
how to find them?

16:47.785 --> 16:48.652
You know all that because
you are one of them.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.320
You're a hacker.

16:50.388 --> 16:54.124
You can believe whatever
you want to believe.

16:54.191 --> 16:55.591
All right,
okay, I'm sorry.

16:55.659 --> 16:59.261
Let me start
over, all right?

16:59.329 --> 17:02.331
I need your help.

17:02.399 --> 17:04.233
Why should I help you?

17:04.300 --> 17:07.036
Because maybe you want
to find Jericho 11

17:07.103 --> 17:09.070
just as much as I do.

17:09.138 --> 17:10.506
I'll share my theories you
share your theories,

17:10.573 --> 17:12.473
we pool our resources.

17:16.444 --> 17:19.079
<i>He's fishing, how
much does he really know.</i>

17:19.147 --> 17:21.782
I know a lot more
than you think.

17:21.851 --> 17:23.483
I don't know.

17:23.553 --> 17:26.319
What does the name
Peter Dukette mean to you?

17:33.294 --> 17:34.695
You think he's Jericho 11?

17:34.763 --> 17:37.264
Whether he is or isn't

17:37.331 --> 17:41.669
we think he's the one who
hacked our company.

17:41.736 --> 17:44.303
I don't know anything;
I can't help you

17:44.371 --> 17:46.005
with this, I'm sorry.

17:46.073 --> 17:47.440
What happened to you?

17:47.507 --> 17:48.875
Someone do
something to you?

17:48.943 --> 17:50.443
What?

17:50.510 --> 17:52.812
The way you pulled a knife
on me, that's not natural.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.847
<i>I don't need your pity.</i>

17:54.915 --> 17:56.549
This isn't pity.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.184
But if you want to talk to
someone you let me know.

18:18.870 --> 18:20.204
<i>If you want
to talk to someone you</i>

18:20.271 --> 18:21.973
<i>let me know.</i>

18:22.040 --> 18:24.475
So who are you;
Dr. Phil or Lars Trenton?

18:24.542 --> 18:26.611
Nice choice of
name by the way.

18:26.678 --> 18:28.646
Thank you.

18:28.714 --> 18:30.180
I saw the hanging guy
again; I think it has

18:30.248 --> 18:31.314
something to do
with Dukette.

18:31.381 --> 18:32.983
Okay.

18:33.050 --> 18:36.886
And the room full of junk its
actually old computer equipment.

18:36.954 --> 18:38.387
Anything else?

18:38.455 --> 18:42.993
Yeah I saw thousands of
sequences of numbers,

18:43.060 --> 18:46.596
three groups of three, like
social insurance numbers.

18:46.663 --> 18:50.599
Identity theft; I mean
that could be worth millions.

18:50.667 --> 18:53.902
I have to ask again, do
you think she's in on it?

18:53.970 --> 18:56.204
I don't know; maybe.

18:59.342 --> 19:01.010
Benny, mind if we talk?

19:01.077 --> 19:02.344
I got nothing to say.

19:02.411 --> 19:03.878
Good, then you can listen.

19:03.946 --> 19:05.613
Look you don't know me,
I don't know you, but we got

19:05.681 --> 19:06.814
a lot more in common
than you think.

19:06.882 --> 19:08.349
Give me a break.

19:08.416 --> 19:09.751
I used to be a
punk just like you.

19:09.818 --> 19:11.753
Maybe you still are.

19:11.820 --> 19:13.187
Let me guess, you're good
at computers, you go

19:13.255 --> 19:14.455
places no one else can

19:14.523 --> 19:15.757
but then you realize that
there's money to be made.

19:15.824 --> 19:18.059
Is that what
happened to you?

19:18.127 --> 19:21.094
No, I got caught.

19:21.162 --> 19:22.896
Maybe you're
not that good.

19:22.964 --> 19:24.798
Maybe you're not that bad.

19:24.866 --> 19:26.299
What's that mean?

19:26.367 --> 19:27.600
It means you can still make
something with your skill.

19:29.137 --> 19:31.672
You're a cop right; what
do you make, $75 K?

19:31.739 --> 19:33.707
Well I could use more, we
all could, but it doesn't

19:33.775 --> 19:35.174
mean I run and
become a black hat.

19:35.241 --> 19:36.441
I'm not black hat,
I'm green hat.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.877
I go where the money is.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.311
You're in a position to
help me get the guys that

19:39.379 --> 19:40.846
don't know right
from wrong.

19:40.914 --> 19:42.447
Sorry, I'm just doing this
for the fun of it okay.

19:42.515 --> 19:46.485
You're not mixed up with just
hackers; these are criminals.

19:46.553 --> 19:47.920
That means you and me...

19:47.988 --> 19:51.723
Look we're on a
collision course.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.159
Well I got places
to do, okay.

20:05.522 --> 20:07.690
I can assure you Mr. Klein
that Revenue Canada's data

20:07.758 --> 20:09.524
is absolutely safe.

20:09.592 --> 20:11.058
It is protected by a
bulletproof firewall

20:11.126 --> 20:13.060
second to none,
designed by myself.

20:13.128 --> 20:15.296
No one is questioning your
ability Mr. Niles, however

20:15.364 --> 20:19.367
IIB has reason to believe
that a malicious hacker

20:19.435 --> 20:21.736
is targeting Social
Insurance Numbers.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.438
Since Revenue Canada
handles so much of the

20:23.506 --> 20:25.840
data we felt obligated
to inform you.

20:25.908 --> 20:29.310
You realize that I am just a
consultant for Revenue Canada.

20:29.378 --> 20:31.279
Well it is our
understanding that you are,

20:31.346 --> 20:34.415
for lack of a better term,
their head of internet security.

20:34.482 --> 20:36.817
Listen, I've been
around computers a long time

20:36.885 --> 20:39.387
seen a lot of code, I've
seen hackers, good and bad,

20:39.454 --> 20:40.587
come and go.

20:40.655 --> 20:42.188
That's why they hired me.

20:42.256 --> 20:46.692
So you've heard of someone
using the handle Jericho 11.

20:46.760 --> 20:49.629
How did you
find that name?

20:49.696 --> 20:51.965
So you have heard of it.

20:52.033 --> 20:55.768
Some chatter has come to our
attention regarding that name.

20:55.836 --> 20:58.037
We've been investigating
but so far nothing has

20:58.104 --> 21:00.339
been substantiated.

21:00.407 --> 21:01.673
You think he has something
to do with this threat

21:01.741 --> 21:03.309
to steal SIN numbers?

21:03.376 --> 21:04.843
Possibly.

21:04.911 --> 21:07.413
Does the name Peter Dukette
mean anything to you?

21:07.480 --> 21:08.981
Yes, why?

21:09.049 --> 21:10.983
Well we have reason to
believe that he's Jericho 11.

21:11.051 --> 21:12.251
I find that very unlikely.

21:12.319 --> 21:14.018
And why is that?

21:14.086 --> 21:17.121
Peter Dukette is a paid
consultant to Revenue Canada,

21:17.189 --> 21:21.392
in fact he was the one who
tipped us to Jericho 11.

21:25.730 --> 21:28.766
So you're telling me that
Dukette, the guy that you think

21:28.834 --> 21:32.669
is Jericho 11 is actually
working for the good guys?

21:32.736 --> 21:34.171
Apparently yeah.

21:34.238 --> 21:36.106
I mean granted I don't
understand that much about

21:36.174 --> 21:38.475
the world of hacking but
it seems like all the good

21:38.542 --> 21:40.910
guys and bad guys are kind
of bleeding into one another.

21:40.979 --> 21:44.747
Yeah, white hat, black
hat, hacker versus cracker...

21:44.815 --> 21:46.849
tickling fan,
underscore...

21:46.916 --> 21:48.784
See the problem is whoever
Jericho 11 is, he is going

21:48.852 --> 21:51.087
to steal the SINs, it
doesn't matter if its

21:51.154 --> 21:55.157
Dukette or some other cat...

21:55.225 --> 21:58.461
...Kette or cat... that's good.

21:58.528 --> 21:59.462
- What?
- What?

21:59.630 --> 22:01.964
Here I am... hey.

22:03.032 --> 22:04.232
Do you want to
meet Peter Dukette?

22:04.300 --> 22:05.633
Yeah.

22:05.701 --> 22:08.003
He's having a party
tonight at his loft.

22:08.070 --> 22:10.272
- All right.
- Be there at 11:00.

22:16.778 --> 22:19.113
Hey what's so important
that you had to call me on

22:19.180 --> 22:20.714
my night off?

22:20.781 --> 22:23.217
Forgot to have you sign my
report on the pedestrian mishap.

22:23.284 --> 22:26.887
Oh, okay...that's actually
pretty important.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.322
You look terrific
by the way.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.956
Oh, thank you.

22:30.025 --> 22:31.691
I'm going out
with some friends.

22:31.759 --> 22:32.993
Oh yeah?

22:33.061 --> 22:34.494
Are they here; they
can come inside.

22:34.561 --> 22:37.096
I'm not sure I'm
ready to share.

22:37.164 --> 22:38.264
I don't bite.

22:38.332 --> 22:41.834
I meant you.

22:41.902 --> 22:44.870
Listen Oz, I just wanted to
thank you for taking me on,

22:44.938 --> 22:46.572
making me feel
so comfortable.

22:46.640 --> 22:49.409
I was a little worried about
who I'd be partnered with.

22:49.476 --> 22:51.876
It's all part of the
job and... you're good.

22:51.944 --> 22:54.479
I think you're going to
have an excellent career.

22:54.547 --> 22:57.149
Want to call me later?

22:57.216 --> 23:00.852
You want me to ca...

23:00.920 --> 23:03.821
Hey, this is good I think
how it is, actually.

23:03.889 --> 23:07.458
You're right, just give that
to the nurse and you're cool.

23:07.526 --> 23:09.726
Oh, pen...
all right see you.

23:09.794 --> 23:11.795
Thanks.

23:13.131 --> 23:14.065
Hey what's up?

23:14.132 --> 23:15.066
Hi.

23:15.133 --> 23:16.067
All good?

23:16.134 --> 23:17.068
Why wouldn't it be?

23:17.135 --> 23:18.235
No, nothing.

23:18.303 --> 23:20.671
Does seem a bit
young for you.

23:20.738 --> 23:22.305
Oh that's just work
related stuff, you know

23:22.373 --> 23:23.739
totally platonic.

23:23.807 --> 23:24.874
Plus, she's, uh, she's
out of my league so...

23:24.942 --> 23:26.142
Ah, but if she weren't...

23:26.210 --> 23:27.577
That's not what I meant.

23:27.644 --> 23:28.644
Then I guess I fall right
into your real house.

23:28.712 --> 23:29.912
Do you want to
go for a drink?

23:29.980 --> 23:31.013
I'm actually meeting
someone for drinks right

23:31.082 --> 23:32.014
after my shift.

23:32.083 --> 23:33.249
Really?

23:33.317 --> 23:34.250
Yeah.

23:34.318 --> 23:36.018
Hey Oz.

23:36.087 --> 23:37.520
Hey, hey Liv, how are you?

23:37.588 --> 23:38.653
Good.

23:38.721 --> 23:39.854
Meet me in five Sandy?

23:39.922 --> 23:41.290
Yeah.

23:41.357 --> 23:44.093
Oh, Oz was just telling
about his trainee...

23:46.262 --> 23:47.196
What's her name?

23:47.263 --> 23:48.597
Elise...

23:48.664 --> 23:50.399
Poor thing has to wear a
dress that's a couple

23:50.467 --> 23:51.633
of sizes too small.

23:51.701 --> 23:54.268
Oh, mustn't have
gotten paid yet.

23:54.336 --> 23:57.972
Okay...hey you guys are
going to have fun tonight.

23:58.039 --> 23:59.840
I'm going to go; I'll
catch up with you later.

23:59.908 --> 24:04.245
You do that and oh,
say hi to Elise for us.

24:10.051 --> 24:10.984
How's it going?

24:11.051 --> 24:12.785
Name?

24:12.853 --> 24:14.721
Lars Trenton,
he's with me.

24:35.142 --> 24:36.108
Would you like a drink?

24:36.176 --> 24:37.109
I would love a drink.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.514
Nice...

24:41.581 --> 24:44.482
Are you okay?
You seem distracted.

24:44.550 --> 24:47.885
Yeah, no, I just think I
chose the wrong career.

24:47.953 --> 24:50.121
Well trust me, not all
hackers live like this.

24:51.089 --> 24:52.023
Hey...

24:52.090 --> 24:53.491
Vodka soda please.

24:53.559 --> 24:54.492
And I'll get a scotch.

24:54.560 --> 24:55.493
Yeah.

24:55.561 --> 24:56.494
You must be Lars Trenton.

24:56.562 --> 24:57.662
Hey... Peter Dukette.

24:57.729 --> 24:59.496
Yeah, hey, nice
to meet you.

24:59.564 --> 25:00.531
Hi.

25:00.598 --> 25:01.931
Hi.

25:04.902 --> 25:06.403
Marisa tells me that
you're having some

25:06.471 --> 25:07.804
difficulties with the
business venture.

25:07.872 --> 25:09.273
I am, yeah.

25:09.340 --> 25:11.041
I hope you can
help me out.

25:11.108 --> 25:13.310
Well if Marisa vouches for
you it's good enough for me.

25:13.378 --> 25:16.379
Let's talk.
Would you excuse us?

25:22.419 --> 25:23.752
What are you
doing here cop?

25:23.820 --> 25:25.221
My job.

25:25.289 --> 25:26.855
You're really
getting on my nerves.

25:26.923 --> 25:28.257
Good, good,
Ido what I can.

25:28.325 --> 25:30.392
Black hat battle's
about to begin.

25:30.459 --> 25:32.360
What do you say you
and I have a go.

25:32.428 --> 25:34.296
I don't do that anymore.

25:34.363 --> 25:39.033
You scared, afraid
you lost your touch?

25:39.101 --> 25:41.403
All right here's the deal;
you win I'll get off your case,

25:41.470 --> 25:43.738
I win you show
me a little respect.

25:43.806 --> 25:47.007
Somebody said they used
to call you Lockdown...

25:47.075 --> 25:51.044
I got a new name for you
old man, Dialup.

25:51.112 --> 25:52.680
I was just hoping that you
could point me towards the

25:52.747 --> 25:55.649
sort of individuals I'm
looking for...

25:55.717 --> 25:57.251
and I'm not looking

25:57.319 --> 26:00.321
for your average black hat
that hates the Jameson's...

26:00.388 --> 26:01.755
Who are you looking for?

26:01.823 --> 26:04.457
I'm looking for someone
like Jericho 11.

26:04.525 --> 26:07.260
<i>Where
are you Jericho?</i>

26:07.328 --> 26:09.529
Then again maybe I'm
chasing a ghost.

26:09.597 --> 26:11.097
Possibly but if he's
anything like me I bet

26:11.164 --> 26:15.702
he's interested in a few
thousand credit card numbers.

26:15.769 --> 26:18.503
All right, well what
interests you Mr. Dukette?

26:18.571 --> 26:20.972
What interests me
Mr. Trenton is water,

26:21.040 --> 26:22.541
alternative energy.

26:22.609 --> 26:23.742
The future... I am interested
in changing the world.

26:23.809 --> 26:24.776
For the better?

26:24.844 --> 26:26.245
I believe so.

26:26.312 --> 26:27.112
What if I told you my
goal in life was to see

26:27.179 --> 26:28.480
Wall Street destroyed?

26:28.548 --> 26:29.948
Is that a bad thing?

26:30.015 --> 26:32.284
No, no, it's
outdated model.

26:32.352 --> 26:34.686
Hm... we agree on that.

26:34.754 --> 26:36.287
It's corrupt.

26:36.355 --> 26:37.822
It's destroying the middle
class that it should serve.

26:37.890 --> 26:41.926
And do you know
what gleaning is?

26:41.994 --> 26:43.394
Is it biblical?

26:43.462 --> 26:44.796
The poor were allowed to
scour the fields after the

26:44.864 --> 26:46.998
harvest had been taken,
collecting what they could

26:47.066 --> 26:49.234
for themselves.

26:49.301 --> 26:51.501
You understand?

26:54.705 --> 26:56.439
Yeah I think so...

26:56.507 --> 26:58.242
if the existing economic
system were destroyed then

26:58.309 --> 27:01.678
the average guy would be able
to find wealth in the rubble.

27:01.746 --> 27:03.013
Close enough.

27:03.081 --> 27:04.547
Now if that's
Jericho 11's objective

27:04.615 --> 27:06.150
then more power to him.

27:06.217 --> 27:07.650
Unfortunately for now
my job is to stop him.

27:07.717 --> 27:12.221
But there is a revolution
coming and I'm sure that

27:12.289 --> 27:14.791
he'll be part of it.

27:16.894 --> 27:18.694
Guys... it's the hack off.

27:23.432 --> 27:25.533
I hope you found what
you were looking for.

27:25.601 --> 27:27.302
The guy's got a
lot of big ideas.

27:27.369 --> 27:30.138
He's developing a
Messiah complex.

27:30.206 --> 27:33.308
It's a merging of the internet
with the human conscience.

27:33.375 --> 27:35.010
It gets me kind of hot.

27:35.077 --> 27:36.845
So you arranged this
whole thing to convince

27:36.913 --> 27:39.213
me he's not Jericho 11.

27:39.281 --> 27:43.951
Well like you said, everyone
has their secrets, right?

27:45.187 --> 27:47.654
What do you say...
HOC, Norad,

27:47.722 --> 27:48.722
your old buddy's
at the Department of Defense...

27:48.790 --> 27:50.057
Not hacking anything.

27:50.125 --> 27:52.993
We just penetrate,
no damage.

27:53.061 --> 27:55.094
Okay..
Department of Defense.

27:58.899 --> 28:01.367
Ready, set, hack.

28:06.874 --> 28:08.607
Benny's found
the source code.

28:10.944 --> 28:12.644
So has Dialup.

28:23.923 --> 28:26.791
<i>Sequel injection...
get the blind data.</i>

28:30.028 --> 28:31.462
<i>Go man!</i>

28:33.665 --> 28:36.234
<i>Come on, he's
decrypting the password...</i>

28:43.307 --> 28:45.008
We have a winner; Benny!

28:55.418 --> 28:56.618
I hate to break
it to you but that kid

28:56.686 --> 28:58.087
might be past redemption.

28:58.154 --> 28:59.521
That's what I
was counting on.

28:59.589 --> 29:02.024
I just planted a z-bot in
Peter Dukette's system.

29:02.092 --> 29:03.725
I'm not following you;
speak English.

29:03.793 --> 29:05.460
Okay I knew I couldn't get
behind Peter Dukette's

29:05.470 --> 29:06.895
- firewall unless I was invited.
- Yeah.

29:06.962 --> 29:08.796
It cost me the battle
but it's in there.

29:08.864 --> 29:10.631
We now have access to
all of Peter Dukette's

29:10.699 --> 29:12.665
computers and
whatever he is into.

29:12.733 --> 29:13.733
Nice.

29:13.801 --> 29:14.868
Lockdown is back baby!

29:14.936 --> 29:16.003
Who's Lockdown?

29:16.570 --> 29:17.670
- Is that you?
- I'm Lockdown.

29:17.738 --> 29:18.805
Oh.

29:21.286 --> 29:23.454
The z-bot is in, I got to
take it nice and slow though.

29:23.521 --> 29:25.122
Dukette could have
a trap set up in there.

29:25.190 --> 29:26.723
I got a hit off someone in
that room about something

29:26.791 --> 29:28.325
called blind data.

29:28.393 --> 29:30.926
Blind data?
I'll keep that in mind.

29:30.994 --> 29:33.496
So Dukette was looking
for Jericho 11 as well.

29:33.564 --> 29:34.763
Yeah.

29:34.831 --> 29:36.065
Maybe he really is
on the up and up.

29:36.133 --> 29:37.500
I don't know; there's
something up with him.

29:37.568 --> 29:39.268
My hits off Benny and Marisa
have been quite accurate.

29:39.336 --> 29:42.871
Speaking of Marisa, I mean
that girl, she's 22 years old,

29:42.939 --> 29:45.040
a few minor charges for
theft but nothing crazy.

29:45.109 --> 29:46.674
She's just a bit
of a street punk.

29:46.742 --> 29:48.776
Makes you wonder if she got
mixed up with Peter Dukette.

29:48.844 --> 29:50.812
Yeah, a little more than
mixed up from what I saw.

29:50.813 --> 29:51.879
You mind if I
borrow that phone?

29:51.880 --> 29:52.747
No, not at all.

29:52.815 --> 29:54.381
All this religious stuff
Peter's been talking about...

29:54.380 --> 29:57.519
The name Jericho...
I think there's something there.

29:57.587 --> 29:58.653
I'm going to go find out.

29:58.721 --> 29:59.621
Let me know if
you get anything.

29:59.688 --> 30:00.755
See you guys later.

30:00.823 --> 30:03.957
So I think I got
something, okay?

30:04.025 --> 30:06.427
That name Toby was talking
about, Blind Data?

30:06.495 --> 30:09.563
They own a server and
Peter Dukette and his minions

30:09.631 --> 30:11.232
have been snooping around
on it quite a bit.

30:11.299 --> 30:13.934
Well given his job I'm sure he
looks at servers every day.

30:14.002 --> 30:18.438
No doubt, but Blind Data
is owned by Kenneth Niles.

30:18.506 --> 30:21.741
The security consultant
for Revenue Canada.

30:21.808 --> 30:23.476
Okay.

30:25.179 --> 30:26.112
Morning.

30:26.180 --> 30:28.181
Good morning, after you.

30:28.249 --> 30:32.418
Look yesterday after work,
did I do something wrong?

30:32.486 --> 30:35.521
No, no, no, you did not.

30:35.588 --> 30:37.022
Okay because you know,
I was just hoping you'd call or...

30:37.089 --> 30:39.858
I'm seeing somebody.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.293
There you go. I should
have said that earlier.

30:41.361 --> 30:43.529
I just started
seeing somebody.

30:43.596 --> 30:46.598
It's kind of great and new and
I kind of really like her so...

30:46.666 --> 30:49.168
Okay, that explains
everything.

30:49.235 --> 30:52.836
Right yeah, I mean I think
that you're great and uh...

30:52.904 --> 30:55.306
if I had met you six months
ago, who knows.

30:55.374 --> 30:56.974
But there it is.

30:57.042 --> 30:58.442
Okay.

30:58.510 --> 31:00.244
- Okay?
- Yeah.

31:00.312 --> 31:02.280
Well if anything changes...

31:02.347 --> 31:05.516
<i>University 21,
personal injury, female 42,</i>

31:05.584 --> 31:06.749
<i>Grange and John...</i>

31:06.817 --> 31:09.319
Unit 21 responding, copy.

31:09.387 --> 31:10.420
Shall we?

31:10.488 --> 31:12.656
Yeah.

31:33.744 --> 31:37.313
Blind Data is just one of
a number of companies I own.

31:37.380 --> 31:39.881
Onsite scrubbing,
destruction of hard drives

31:39.949 --> 31:41.649
and backup devices.

31:41.718 --> 31:43.185
We take redundant
information and safely

31:43.252 --> 31:44.920
dispose of it.

31:44.987 --> 31:46.755
Well is there any reason
that Peter Dukette would

31:46.823 --> 31:49.490
need or want access
to that company?

31:49.558 --> 31:51.292
No, none that
I can think of.

31:58.734 --> 32:01.836
Well this so-called
redundant information,

32:01.903 --> 32:04.339
this is people's names,
credit card numbers,

32:04.406 --> 32:06.741
their security codes,
even their SIN numbers?

32:06.808 --> 32:08.175
Could be?

32:08.244 --> 32:09.344
Maybe he's planning to
steal that information

32:09.411 --> 32:11.011
from Blind Data.

32:11.079 --> 32:13.380
Impossible; the man works with
me, I trust him completely.

32:13.448 --> 32:15.515
Well, I believe the going
rate for SIN numbers

32:15.583 --> 32:17.984
on the black market is
what, $10 a pop.

32:18.052 --> 32:19.553
Ten dollars?

32:19.621 --> 32:21.555
So if he were to hack into
your site how many numbers

32:21.623 --> 32:22.623
are we talking about?

32:22.690 --> 32:25.859
Millions.

32:25.926 --> 32:28.427
Well that's a lot
of money Mr. Niles.

32:28.495 --> 32:31.597
Enough to tempt
anyone I should think.

32:40.907 --> 32:42.675
Really appreciate you
sharing this with me;

32:42.743 --> 32:43.775
I'll look into
it immediately.

32:45.043 --> 32:46.645
Yeah?

32:46.712 --> 32:48.946
Hey we've been looking at this
Jericho 11 thing all wrong.

32:49.014 --> 32:50.348
You know when I first read
Benny I thought it was

32:50.416 --> 32:52.584
a person, but what if
it's not a person?

32:52.652 --> 32:53.818
What are you
talking about?

32:53.886 --> 32:55.086
Look in the Bible.

32:55.154 --> 32:56.454
Jericho is a city with
huge strong walls

32:56.522 --> 32:59.523
protecting it; a guy named
Joshua blows his trumpet

32:59.591 --> 33:00.791
until the walls collapse.

33:00.858 --> 33:03.527
Jericho is not a
hacker, it's a target.

33:03.595 --> 33:05.763
But what if it's a
computer behind that wall,

33:05.830 --> 33:07.097
behind a firewall?

33:10.393 --> 33:11.626
Getting into these
archives was like raising

33:11.694 --> 33:13.362
Lazarus from the dead.

33:13.429 --> 33:14.997
Anyway Jericho 11 was
the name assigned to a

33:15.064 --> 33:18.066
computer built for Revenue
Canada in the early 1980s.

33:18.134 --> 33:20.535
Its primary function was
data backup and storage.

33:20.603 --> 33:23.372
And one of the engineers is
none other than Kenneth Niles.

33:23.439 --> 33:25.439
He must have
known all along.

33:25.507 --> 33:27.975
So Jericho 11 is sitting
around gather dust with a

33:28.043 --> 33:29.676
whole bunch of old
electronic equipment,

33:29.744 --> 33:31.212
like magnetic backup tapes.

33:31.279 --> 33:33.680
The equipment room that
Toby saw in his read.

33:33.748 --> 33:36.017
It's old stuff, outdated,
forgotten by the world.

33:36.084 --> 33:37.751
Yeah, except for Kenneth
Niles who has long since

33:37.819 --> 33:40.253
left Revenue Canada and
started up his own business.

33:40.321 --> 33:42.188
Disposing of old data...

33:42.256 --> 33:43.923
Like those old
Jericho 11 tapes.

33:43.991 --> 33:46.192
Suddenly he has access to
millions of SIN numbers,

33:46.260 --> 33:47.793
all he needs is a buyer.

33:47.861 --> 33:49.862
And who better to help set
that up than Peter Dukette.

33:49.930 --> 33:51.564
So how does he do it?

33:51.632 --> 33:54.934
Me, I'd bring Jericho 11
back online, transfer the

33:55.002 --> 33:57.669
data to a secure server
that I own and let the

33:57.737 --> 33:59.171
middleman handle the rest.

33:59.239 --> 34:01.473
That's why Dukette was
probing Blind Data server.

34:01.541 --> 34:03.075
He was prepping
for the transfer.

34:03.143 --> 34:04.843
Okay there's just one thing
that's bothering me here.

34:04.911 --> 34:05.844
Does Dukette seem like
the type of guy

34:05.912 --> 34:07.546
who would share his plan?

34:08.112 --> 34:08.980
No.

34:09.049 --> 34:11.750
So how did Toby get his
read from Hack Girl;

34:11.817 --> 34:14.717
how did she know?

34:27.632 --> 34:30.167
Mind if I come in?

34:30.234 --> 34:31.768
I'm a little busy.

34:31.835 --> 34:37.274
I just want to talk to you
about Jericho 11 and Joshua.

34:37.341 --> 34:39.208
Joshua Patterson,
your father.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.790
Hello, Hi, yeah.

34:54.857 --> 34:56.257
We have a problem.

34:56.326 --> 34:57.693
Only one?

34:57.760 --> 34:59.761
I just got off the phone
with Revenue Canada and

34:59.829 --> 35:01.696
yes they recently signed
a deal with Blind Data to

35:01.763 --> 35:04.232
destroy the
Jericho 11 files.

35:04.300 --> 35:05.533
Suggested by Kenneth
Niles no doubt.

35:05.601 --> 35:07.102
Well exactly, but
here's the thing.

35:07.169 --> 35:08.970
Blind Data just
moved up the date.

35:09.037 --> 35:10.105
To when?

35:10.172 --> 35:11.172
Today.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.173
I'll take Kenneth Niles.

35:12.241 --> 35:13.208
I'll take Peter Dukette.

35:24.685 --> 35:27.588
It's a cool place.

35:32.859 --> 35:37.730
So you actually
sleep up there?

35:37.797 --> 35:40.566
Yeah.

35:40.634 --> 35:46.272
Want to tell me
about your father?

35:46.340 --> 35:49.641
My father was a
quiet, brilliant man.

35:49.708 --> 35:52.377
He went about his business
asking for nothing,

35:52.445 --> 35:56.515
ultimately
receiving nothing.

35:56.582 --> 36:00.318
He worked for
Revenue Canada?

36:00.386 --> 36:02.687
Kenneth Niles took
credit for everything

36:02.755 --> 36:06.990
about the Jericho 11 project.

36:07.058 --> 36:11.395
I mean it was my dad's idea,
even the name, the whole thing.

36:11.463 --> 36:16.033
That's kind of funny,
Joshua protecting Jericho.

36:16.100 --> 36:19.203
My dad said
nothing, not a word.

36:19.271 --> 36:22.104
Even when Revenue
Canada downsized him.

36:22.173 --> 36:23.906
After all Kenneth went
off and started his own

36:23.974 --> 36:26.576
business, why
couldn't my dad?

36:26.644 --> 36:28.811
What went wrong?

36:28.879 --> 36:30.647
Kenneth Niles is
what went wrong.

36:57.739 --> 37:01.008
Step away from
the computer!

37:01.076 --> 37:03.711
What's this about?

37:03.778 --> 37:05.145
Jericho 11.

37:05.214 --> 37:06.614
You said you didn't
know anything about it.

37:06.682 --> 37:08.648
My work is highly
classified, absolute

37:08.716 --> 37:10.617
discretion is required.

37:10.685 --> 37:12.752
Well we have officers
raiding Dukette's office

37:12.820 --> 37:15.388
right now so unless you
start talking you're

37:15.456 --> 37:17.224
going to find your
computer privileges very

37:17.291 --> 37:18.858
limited in prison.

37:21.462 --> 37:22.929
This is a good day for you
to leave work early Benny,

37:22.996 --> 37:23.996
if you know what I mean.

37:24.064 --> 37:25.464
- Dude...
- Hey.

37:25.532 --> 37:28.267
I said this is a good
day to leave work early.

37:39.579 --> 37:44.048
My dad started his own IT
security firm, right?

37:44.116 --> 37:47.752
But his major client got hacked
so his reputation was ruined.

37:56.394 --> 38:00.731
This is a man in his fifties
with no way of starting over.

38:04.034 --> 38:05.669
You're in big
trouble Mr. Dukette.

38:05.737 --> 38:08.972
I know, there were 14 million
SIN numbers on that computer.

38:09.039 --> 38:12.041
At $10 apiece that's a lot of
money for you and your partner.

38:12.109 --> 38:13.142
I'm surprised you're not
more upset seeing how

38:13.209 --> 38:14.677
you're about to lose it.

38:14.745 --> 38:16.779
I told you before that I'm
not a criminal anymore.

38:16.846 --> 38:18.314
In fact I was going to
redirect all that money to

38:18.382 --> 38:19.815
something useful.

38:19.883 --> 38:21.183
Of course, Kenneth he
didn't know that; he would

38:21.251 --> 38:23.852
have been very upset when
he found out but who is he

38:23.920 --> 38:25.254
going to complain to?

38:25.322 --> 38:27.256
You were going to redirect
that money where?

38:27.324 --> 38:29.724
Haiti maybe, Sudan...I was
thinking about building

38:29.792 --> 38:31.893
solar farms there, having
the locals run them.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.562
A little microeconomics
project in mind.

38:34.630 --> 38:38.600
See that is how you burn
the system down, Lockdown.

38:38.668 --> 38:40.802
It is by empowering
the little guy.

38:40.869 --> 38:44.505
Yeah well it's too bad none of
that's going to happen now.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.373
Well the irony is that
it never would have.

38:46.374 --> 38:47.041
Why?

38:47.109 --> 38:48.742
Because someone is stealing
the SIN numbers from my

38:48.810 --> 38:51.445
computer as we speak.
I've been hacked.

38:51.513 --> 38:55.449
And one day it was
just...

38:55.517 --> 38:59.085
...it was all a
bit too much for him.

39:12.300 --> 39:15.335
And the hacker
was Kenneth Niles.

39:15.402 --> 39:18.670
Mmmhm...

39:18.738 --> 39:21.807
So I hacked his computers
and I watched

39:21.875 --> 39:26.011
for years to try to find
some way to pay him back.

39:26.079 --> 39:29.081
But not just for what
he did to my dad,

39:29.149 --> 39:34.085
but for everyone that
he screwed over.

39:34.153 --> 39:35.786
And that's when I found
out about what he was doing

39:35.855 --> 39:39.490
with Jericho 11, and I also
knew about Peter's involvement.

39:39.558 --> 39:41.826
What, so you pretended
to be attracted to Peter to get

39:41.894 --> 39:46.797
close to him, to steal their
big payday, is that it?

39:46.866 --> 39:50.200
I would have never
sold those numbers.

39:50.268 --> 39:55.272
It's 14 million
people's lives!

39:55.340 --> 39:57.140
Peter would go...
he would go on about these

39:57.208 --> 39:59.910
benevolent concepts but
really he couldn't care less

39:59.978 --> 40:03.247
what happened
to those people.

40:03.314 --> 40:05.014
He was just like how
Kenneth Niles could care less

40:05.082 --> 40:06.883
what happened to my dad.

40:06.950 --> 40:10.386
And now these lives
are in your hands.

40:10.453 --> 40:13.856
Yeah they are.

40:13.924 --> 40:15.258
But...

40:24.733 --> 40:29.837
My life is in your hands.

40:33.442 --> 40:40.814
There's $140,000,000 here,
fourteen million lives.

40:41.749 --> 40:45.652
That's crazy.

40:45.720 --> 40:48.222
Do hard drives
like microwaves...?

40:48.290 --> 40:50.224
No.

41:12.946 --> 41:14.379
- Hey.
- Hey!

41:14.447 --> 41:16.448
...Oz, why are you
waiting out here in the cold?

41:16.515 --> 41:17.682
I was kind of hoping
we could have a little

41:17.750 --> 41:20.252
private moment.

41:20.320 --> 41:21.653
- Okay.
- Yeah...

41:21.720 --> 41:24.923
Uhm... that was ridiculous
what I said yesterday.

41:24.990 --> 41:26.991
I didn't... you know,
the whole league thing,

41:27.059 --> 41:28.159
- That was a bad joke... - Oz
I was...               - Oz

41:28.226 --> 41:30.995
Oz...? shut up.

41:31.063 --> 41:32.463
Okay.

41:32.530 --> 41:34.465
Look here's the deal; I
used to be married and now

41:34.532 --> 41:37.001
I'm free and I want to
start enjoying life.

41:37.069 --> 41:39.136
I mean I can be a lot of
fun but I'm not looking

41:39.204 --> 41:40.704
for a commitment you know,
and I'm certainly not

41:40.772 --> 41:42.040
looking for exclusivity.

41:43.508 --> 41:45.476
You cool with that?

41:45.543 --> 41:46.643
You free tonight?

41:46.711 --> 41:48.080
Actually no.

41:49.147 --> 41:51.581
- It's alright.
- Maybe tomorrow?

41:51.648 --> 41:53.749
Yeah, tomorrow works.

41:53.817 --> 41:55.051
You know Oz there might
come a day when you're

41:55.119 --> 41:57.420
not cool with this.

41:57.488 --> 41:59.257
I'm cool with it now.

42:01.825 --> 42:02.926
Okay.

42:13.703 --> 42:15.937
So any news on the SIN numbers?

42:16.005 --> 42:16.938
Whoever hacked Peter Dukette

42:16.940 --> 42:18.974
hasn't done anything
with them yet.

42:19.041 --> 42:19.975
Yeah, I have a
feeling they won't...

42:20.042 --> 42:21.341
Do you?

42:21.409 --> 42:22.843
Yeah.

42:22.911 --> 42:24.411
You know that Hack Girl
has vanished.

42:24.479 --> 42:25.446
Did she?

42:25.450 --> 42:27.147
You wouldn't know anything
about that would you?

42:27.150 --> 42:27.649
Not at all no.

42:27.650 --> 42:29.416
No, no, of course not
because if you did I'm

42:29.484 --> 42:30.818
sure you would tell me.

42:30.886 --> 42:32.019
You'd be the
first to know.

42:35.957 --> 42:37.790
Though I have a feeling
she'd be hard to find.

42:37.858 --> 42:39.759
Do you?

42:39.827 --> 42:41.260
Just have that feeling.

42:41.328 --> 42:42.395
Hmmm.

42:42.462 --> 42:54.006
