07:01.287 --> 07:03.154
      Oh!                       

07:03.156 --> 07:07.225
      I'll bet you knew it      
         all the time.          

07:07.227 --> 07:12.063
          Mr. Quigley,          
  this is my husband, Archie.   

07:12.065 --> 07:14.432
        Hi, sonny.              

07:15.834 --> 07:18.602
    Glad to know you there, pop.
            Uh, Edith...        

07:18.604 --> 07:19.637
                  Get over here.

07:21.206 --> 07:24.909
            Excuse me.          
      Why don't you sit down?   

07:24.911 --> 07:28.212
      What did you do, bring    
  an old man home to take a nap?

07:28.214 --> 07:32.417
Oh, no, Archie. I brought him in
so he could make a phone call.  

07:32.419 --> 07:34.185
You see,                        
he called his daughter          

07:34.187 --> 07:36.154
so she could                    
come and pick him up,           

07:36.156 --> 07:39.257
but she wasn't home,            
so he's gonna call her later on.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.592
      I don't follow you, Edith.

07:41.594 --> 07:43.327
            You take some man   
                out of bed      

07:43.329 --> 07:46.997
        to bring him to my house
          to call his daughter? 

07:46.999 --> 07:48.199
No, you see,                    
it all started--                

07:48.201 --> 07:49.400
            Edith, all right.   
                All right.      

07:49.402 --> 07:52.370
             All right, Edith,  
        I'll find out myself.   

07:52.372 --> 07:55.540
     I'd like to get the story  
  before the first of the month.

07:57.242 --> 07:58.909
            Uh, excuse me there,
                    pop.        

07:58.911 --> 08:01.245
            Uh, you mind        
         if I ask you something?

08:01.247 --> 08:02.580
No, shoot.                      

08:02.582 --> 08:06.117
 Uh, how come you're all dressed
         for beddy-byes?        

08:06.119 --> 08:08.586
Well, at my age                 
you never know                  

08:08.588 --> 08:11.155
when a nap's                    
gonna come over you.            

08:14.526 --> 08:17.962
To tell you the truth, I was    
wearing these when I broke out. 

08:21.866 --> 08:23.667
             When you broke out?

08:23.669 --> 08:28.038
     Mr. Quigley ran away from  
  an old folks' retirement home.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.641
            Why did you do that?

08:30.643 --> 08:32.909
You ever been in                
an old folks' home?             

08:32.912 --> 08:35.746
        Yeah, I used to visit   
    my Uncle Roy in one of them.

08:35.748 --> 08:37.115
    It was pretty soft there.   

08:37.116 --> 08:39.383
    He had three squares a day, 
all the television he wanted,   

08:39.385 --> 08:41.318
            bingo every Tuesday.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.388
Suppose you don't want to       
play bingo every Tuesday.       

08:44.390 --> 08:48.792
    You mean, they force you    
         to play bingo?         

08:51.796 --> 08:54.031
            Will you shut up?   

08:55.400 --> 08:57.701
                  They force you
                  to play bingo?

08:58.770 --> 09:00.304
Of course not.                  

09:00.306 --> 09:01.939
         Well, what's the matter
              with the home?    

09:01.941 --> 09:03.674
You see that wart?              

09:03.676 --> 09:05.209
                 The wart? Yeah.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.611
You know what it's good for?    
                             No.

09:06.613 --> 09:07.711
         Nothing.               

09:07.713 --> 09:09.447
And that's how you feel         

09:09.449 --> 09:10.914
     when you're in             
  an old folks' home.           

09:10.916 --> 09:12.983
      Good-for-nothing          
        and useless.            

09:12.985 --> 09:15.353
     Well, now, listen. I mean, 
if you don't like the home...   

09:15.355 --> 09:16.687
                 After all,     
            it's a free country.

09:16.689 --> 09:19.089
      Why don't you just leave  
    and get a place of your own?

09:19.091 --> 09:21.058
You ever try                    
finding an apartment            

09:21.060 --> 09:22.460
when all you got                
to live on                      

09:22.462 --> 09:25.363
is 180 bucks a month            
Social Security?                

09:25.365 --> 09:26.864
      You'll see.               

09:26.866 --> 09:30.168
How long have you got           
before you'll be 65?            

09:30.170 --> 09:31.636
                 Oh, I got      
        plenty of time there.   

09:31.638 --> 09:33.070
          I ain't been          
      thinking about that.      

09:33.072 --> 09:35.206
            Why don't you       
        make your phone call?   

09:35.208 --> 09:38.543
 Ma, this cash register slip    
    can't be right.             

09:38.545 --> 09:42.012
    You spent over $27 on       
two little bags of groceries?   

09:42.014 --> 09:43.447
      Yeah, that's right.       

09:43.449 --> 09:46.250
Oh, no, that cash register      
must have been on the blink.    

09:46.252 --> 09:48.452
Let me check it                 
for you.                        

09:53.091 --> 09:55.560
     That's right. $27.52.      

09:55.562 --> 09:57.127
              Oh, come on there.

09:57.129 --> 09:59.397
        Nobody can add up a list
            that fast.          

09:59.399 --> 10:01.131
    Let me see the tape here.   

10:01.133 --> 10:03.267
                 I'll tell you  
              what this is here.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.503
      Check into that, Meathead.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.005
    What are you so             
surprised about, Daddy?         

10:08.007 --> 10:09.807
There are plenty of people      
    who can add fast.           

10:09.809 --> 10:11.809
All right,                      
but not at his age.             

10:11.811 --> 10:15.246
I mean, at this age, yeah,      
your head don't click like that.

10:15.248 --> 10:19.049
      What about Sam Ervin?     
His head's clicking pretty good.

10:26.024 --> 10:28.992
That ain't his head.            
It's only his eyebrows.         

10:33.599 --> 10:35.633
    He's right, Arch.           
         It checks out.         

10:35.635 --> 10:37.335
        Ain't that wonderful?   

10:37.337 --> 10:39.103
Well, if you're so good         
at figures                      

10:39.105 --> 10:40.338
how come you ain't              
still working?                  

10:40.340 --> 10:41.739
          It wasn't my fault.   

10:41.741 --> 10:43.407
          I guess they figured  
            that an old man     

10:43.409 --> 10:46.277
         would make the office  
         kind of look run-down. 

10:46.279 --> 10:48.912
            Yep, they got       
          all kinds of medicines

10:48.914 --> 10:51.014
        to keep us living       
        longer and longer.      

10:51.016 --> 10:52.783
            Now they got us     
            living longer,      

10:52.785 --> 10:54.452
            they don't know     
          what to do with us.   

10:54.454 --> 10:55.620
        You wait and see.       

10:55.622 --> 10:58.122
     Oh, I don't want           
     to talk about it.          

11:01.293 --> 11:03.694
          Uh, do you know your  
        daughter's phone number?

11:03.696 --> 11:04.928
    Sure.                       

11:04.930 --> 11:07.598
Five-five-five                  
seven-two-four-three.           

11:07.600 --> 11:09.367
            Five-five-five      
        seven-two-four-three.   

11:09.369 --> 11:12.169
    Well, I think we can get you
out of here faster if I call,   

11:12.171 --> 11:14.672
            because I can       
        talk faster than you.   

11:14.674 --> 11:16.507
If she knew                     
it was me calling,              

11:16.509 --> 11:18.509
she wouldn't even               
pick up the phone.              

11:18.511 --> 11:20.544
                    Oh, I can't 
                believe that.   

11:20.546 --> 11:22.480
            I mean, any daughter
        would be glad to know   

11:22.482 --> 11:23.781
            where her father is.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.650
                 I mean, after--
                    Oh, shush.  

11:25.652 --> 11:27.084
             Hello.             

11:27.086 --> 11:29.654
    You don't know me,          
 but my name is Archie Bunker,  

11:29.656 --> 11:31.589
  and I got good news for you.  

11:31.591 --> 11:33.291
I got your father here with me. 

11:33.293 --> 11:34.425
                 No, no, no, no,

11:34.427 --> 11:35.426
      this ain't the home.      

11:35.428 --> 11:37.461
         No, he crashed         
         out of there.          

11:39.264 --> 11:40.431
        No, no. No, no.         

11:40.433 --> 11:42.733
         He don't want          
     to go back there, see?     

11:42.735 --> 11:47.338
I don't know why. It's got      
  something to do with warts.   

11:49.908 --> 11:51.074
     Well, I tell you what.     

11:51.076 --> 11:53.611
  I live at 704 Hauser Street   
        in Queens,              

11:53.613 --> 11:55.579
        and if you start        
        right over here,        

11:55.581 --> 11:58.683
  you can get him out of here   
before we sit down to eat.      

12:00.919 --> 12:02.486
      Wait a minute there.      

12:03.722 --> 12:06.256
        Are you sure you gave me
         the right number here? 

12:06.258 --> 12:08.826
        Because this don't sound
        like your daughter.     

12:08.828 --> 12:11.329
        Did she tell you        
         to go to hell?         

12:11.331 --> 12:12.596
             Yeah.              

12:12.598 --> 12:15.232
      That's my daughter.       

12:23.908 --> 12:25.209
                         Ahh!   

12:25.211 --> 12:27.211
                  Mrs. Bunker,  
            a lunch like this   

12:27.213 --> 12:28.879
        on top of that breakfast
              this morning      

12:28.881 --> 12:30.280
              and that wonderful
                night's sleep,  

12:30.282 --> 12:31.982
            you're just going   
                  to spoil me.  

12:31.984 --> 12:36.019
Oh, it's my pleasure,           
Mr. Quigley.                    

12:36.021 --> 12:37.921
             Oh, no more coffee,
                please.         

12:37.923 --> 12:40.123
I'm taking this                 
up to Archie.                   

12:40.125 --> 12:42.259
He's sleeping late              
this morning.                   

12:42.261 --> 12:47.030
          Now, don't you forget 
        to call your friend Joe.

12:47.032 --> 12:48.866
              Ah!               

12:48.868 --> 12:50.267
            No, no.             

12:50.269 --> 12:51.435
              No!               

12:51.437 --> 12:53.671
         I wasn't-- No.         

12:53.673 --> 12:54.672
              Uh!               

12:54.674 --> 12:55.906
            Oh, no!             

12:55.908 --> 12:57.007
                      No!       

12:57.009 --> 12:58.409
No! No! Get away from me!       

12:58.411 --> 12:59.610
         Get away from me!      

12:59.612 --> 13:01.278
                     Arggh!     

13:02.981 --> 13:05.082
                Ohh, Edith.     

13:05.084 --> 13:07.017
                What time is it?

13:07.019 --> 13:08.786
  It's 12:00.                   

13:08.788 --> 13:10.488
              Twelve o'clock?   
        Half the day is gone.   

13:10.490 --> 13:11.756
                  Why didn't you
                    wake me up? 

13:11.758 --> 13:13.290
It's your day off,              
Archie.                         

13:13.292 --> 13:14.925
You needed your rest.           

13:14.927 --> 13:17.327
            But, Edith, I was   
        having a nightmare here.

13:17.329 --> 13:20.631
    Don't ever let me sleep     
    when I'm having a nightmare.

13:22.601 --> 13:24.334
I'm sorry, Archie.              

13:24.336 --> 13:26.136
What did you dream?             

13:26.138 --> 13:29.139
        Oh, jeez, Edith,        
            it was awful.       

13:29.141 --> 13:31.975
I was out all alone someplace   
    in the cold, you know?      

13:31.977 --> 13:33.944
             Only in my pajamas.

13:33.946 --> 13:37.180
          And it's snowing, see,
          and I'm freezing cold.

13:37.182 --> 13:39.750
         And I'm stumbling along
         tripping over my beard.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.385
What beard?                     

13:41.387 --> 13:46.256
        In the dream I got      
        a long white beard, see?

13:46.258 --> 13:48.826
    And I'm going along there   
    and I'm stumbling over it   

13:48.828 --> 13:50.060
                and I'm--       

13:50.062 --> 13:52.329
             I'm looking for    
        Mike and Gloria's house.

13:52.331 --> 13:57.034
You mean Mike and Gloria        
moved into their own house?     

13:59.304 --> 14:03.307
         Yeah. That was the only
         good part of the dream.

14:06.711 --> 14:09.814
    So I'm going through this   
 strange neighborhood, you know,

14:09.816 --> 14:12.783
and I'm looking for their house,
  but I can't find the address  

14:12.785 --> 14:16.720
    because all the street signs
        are in Polish.          

14:20.191 --> 14:22.125
                  But then,     
            all of a sudden     

14:22.127 --> 14:24.662
              I heard the sound 
             of somebody eating.

14:24.664 --> 14:28.566
        I said, "That must be   
          the meathead's house."

14:28.568 --> 14:31.635
          So I followed the     
    munching-and-crunching noise

14:31.637 --> 14:33.370
                    right up    
            to the door, see,   

14:33.372 --> 14:36.039
         and I knock on the door
          and Gloria comes out. 

14:36.041 --> 14:38.108
             She says, "Get away
             from here, old man.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.543
                     Go on,     
            get out of here."   

14:39.545 --> 14:41.178
            And she stands there
            laughing at me.     

14:41.180 --> 14:44.548
Oh, Gloria would never          
do a thing like that.           

14:44.550 --> 14:46.517
                Don't tell me   
             she wouldn't do it.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.586
                I seen it       
            with my own eyes.   

14:49.721 --> 14:51.088
                 And she's      
        laughing at me there,   

14:51.090 --> 14:53.423
        and all of a sudden     
out pop two little kids, see.   

14:53.425 --> 14:54.692
What kids?                      

14:54.694 --> 14:57.528
            Their kids,         
         our grandchildren, see.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.563
Aww.                            
                     Yeah.      

14:59.565 --> 15:02.967
    Two little twin Meatheads   
         about 6 years of age.  

15:05.303 --> 15:08.639
    And both of them have got   
        long hair and mustaches.

15:11.543 --> 15:13.377
                  You know what 
                they done to me?

15:13.379 --> 15:15.479
                They grabbed me 
            by my white beard   

15:15.481 --> 15:17.815
        and kicked my ankles.   

15:17.817 --> 15:21.184
Poor Archie.                    
What did you do?                

15:21.186 --> 15:23.988
        Oh, I hollered out      
    to Gloria for help there,   

15:23.990 --> 15:26.891
      but all she done was laugh
     and say, "Get out of here."

15:26.893 --> 15:28.659
            And she went        
    and made a phone call.      

15:28.661 --> 15:31.061
 The next thing you know, these 
  two big guys showed up, see,  

15:31.063 --> 15:32.195
     all dressed in white.      

15:32.197 --> 15:33.831
         And then they          
      threw a net over me       

15:33.833 --> 15:36.299
      and dragged me into       
    this old building, see.     

15:36.301 --> 15:38.936
    And I'm cold and I'm wet    
         and I'm tired.         

15:38.938 --> 15:41.438
All I want to do is sleep.      
  They wouldn't let me sleep.   

15:41.440 --> 15:43.908
They kept me up all night       
         playing bingo.         

15:49.247 --> 15:51.248
          Did you win?          

15:59.457 --> 16:03.360
  I couldn't win. They gave me  
 a card with no numbers on it.  

16:04.429 --> 16:06.797
      Oh, my!                   

16:06.799 --> 16:10.000
         Now, why would I dream 
    an awful dream like that?   

16:10.002 --> 16:13.904
Maybe it had something to do    
with Mr. Quigley.               

16:13.906 --> 16:15.606
          Quigley! That's right.

16:15.608 --> 16:18.308
          Because he slept under
          the same roof with me.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.310
        Because you and the kids
                conned me       

16:20.312 --> 16:22.112
              into letting him  
            stay here overnight.

16:22.114 --> 16:24.514
 Well, it's overnight right now,
    and I want him out.         

16:24.516 --> 16:28.218
        Oh, but, Archie,        
      maybe he will, very soon. 

16:28.220 --> 16:29.753
Yeah? Why?                      

16:29.755 --> 16:33.323
     Well, because he told me   
  he had an old friend named Joe

16:33.325 --> 16:35.593
                he could share  
              an apartment with.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.194
When is he gonna                
come and get him?               

16:37.196 --> 16:38.662
            Oh, I don't know.   

16:38.664 --> 16:41.932
        You see, Mr. Quigley    
    had a fight with his friend,

16:41.934 --> 16:43.801
              and he didn't want
                to call.        

16:43.803 --> 16:45.235
Oh, jeez.                       

16:45.237 --> 16:49.372
But something I said to him must
  have made him change his mind 

16:49.374 --> 16:50.841
                and call Joe.   

16:50.843 --> 16:52.743
Oh, yeah?                       
What did you say?               

16:52.745 --> 16:56.046
                I said,         
    "Why don't you call Joe?"   

17:00.485 --> 17:03.153
  So, Mr. Quigley, is everything
     set between you and Joe?   

17:03.155 --> 17:05.923
        Well, if it ain't,      
  I'll just go back to the home.

17:05.925 --> 17:08.458
I thought you said you'd        
never go back there again.      

17:08.460 --> 17:10.060
                    Yeah, I did.

17:10.061 --> 17:12.229
                  But you know  
                the old proverb.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.696
          "A bird in the hand--"

17:13.699 --> 17:14.765
Oh, yeah.                       

17:14.767 --> 17:17.034
                    "Can get you
                awful dirty."   

17:21.539 --> 17:23.306
Just passing through, everybody.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.009
I got to get Archie             
     his breakfast.             

17:26.645 --> 17:29.079
         What did you do for fun
            when you were 21?   

17:29.081 --> 17:32.049
        A lot of things         
        I can't do now.         

17:35.253 --> 17:38.889
     Yeah, but what I liked     
 to do most was to go dancing.  

17:38.891 --> 17:41.792
Oh, really? What kind of dancing
did you do way back then?       

17:41.794 --> 17:42.926
                  I'll show you.

17:42.928 --> 17:43.961
              Oh.               

17:43.963 --> 17:45.428
    Now, here we go.            

17:45.430 --> 17:48.331
♪ Everybody's doin' it          
Doin' it, doin' it ♪

17:58.544 --> 17:59.777
  Hey!                          

18:08.286 --> 18:10.721
             Quigley, what about
            the phone call?     

18:10.723 --> 18:12.622
It's all set.                   
Joe's coming to pick me up.     

18:12.624 --> 18:13.757
                 Oh, good. When?

18:13.759 --> 18:14.992
Could be any minute.            

18:14.994 --> 18:16.393
                  Oh, wonderful,
                    wonderful.  

18:16.395 --> 18:18.962
             Or it could be     
              a few days.       

18:18.964 --> 18:20.831
                     Now, don't 
                get me wrong.   

18:20.833 --> 18:23.167
                  Joe's bright, 
                smart as a whip.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.468
                But sometimes   
            Joe kind of forgets.

18:25.470 --> 18:27.705
Joe forgets? Edith!             

18:27.707 --> 18:29.973
              Edith!            

18:29.975 --> 18:31.041
      In here!                  

18:31.043 --> 18:32.209
             Edith, listen.     

18:32.211 --> 18:33.811
          From what I just heard
                out there,      

18:33.813 --> 18:35.879
                 this guy Joe   
              may never get here

18:35.881 --> 18:38.849
          unless he stops first 
        to take a memory course.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.283
             I don't understand.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.285
      Why can't Mr. Quigley stay
         for a couple of days?  

18:42.287 --> 18:44.521
Because I already got           
one freeloader with me          

18:44.523 --> 18:47.825
    and bread's up              
10 cents a loaf.                

18:47.827 --> 18:49.793
    I know what to do.          
    I'll call the home.         

18:49.795 --> 18:51.695
Oh, no, Archie,                 
don't do that.                  

18:51.697 --> 18:53.831
He'll be out of here            
pretty soon,                    

18:53.833 --> 18:55.632
and it don't hurt us            
that much                       

18:55.634 --> 18:58.102
to take care of him             
for a couple of days.           

18:58.104 --> 19:00.070
                    Edith,      
             that ain't our job.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.705
              Let the government
            take care of him.   

19:01.707 --> 19:03.040
    But that's just it, Arch.   

19:03.042 --> 19:04.441
The government's                
not taking care of him.         

19:04.443 --> 19:05.743
                What are you    
                  talking about?

19:05.745 --> 19:07.945
        You heard yourself,     
  the guy's got Social Security.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.246
Sure, 180 bucks a month.        

19:09.248 --> 19:11.615
Meanwhile, the official         
poverty level is 205 a month.   

19:11.617 --> 19:12.983
Don't you see, Arch?            

19:12.985 --> 19:15.119
The government is just helping  
 old people to starve slower.   

19:15.121 --> 19:17.287
      Well, maybe when you start
    working and paying taxes,   

19:17.289 --> 19:19.189
            the government      
            can do better.      

19:20.558 --> 19:21.892
Arch, guys like Quigley         

19:21.894 --> 19:23.526
can barely make ends meet       
  when they're healthy.         

19:23.528 --> 19:24.795
What happens                    
when he gets sick?              

19:24.797 --> 19:25.863
                Don't be stupid!

19:25.865 --> 19:28.398
        Ain't you never heard   
                of Medicure?    

19:30.501 --> 19:32.002
It's Medicare.                  

19:32.004 --> 19:34.304
And I saw a documentary         
about it on television.         

19:34.306 --> 19:36.740
The way it works out,           
it only pays for 42 percent.    

19:36.742 --> 19:38.541
  The rest comes out of         
the old people's pockets.       

19:38.543 --> 19:40.510
            Can't you see       
                 by my face     

19:40.512 --> 19:42.545
        that I don't want to    
          talk about it no more?

19:42.547 --> 19:44.581
  Well, I want to               
talk about it, Arch!            

19:44.583 --> 19:46.416
        Maybe we should.        

19:46.418 --> 19:51.321
    It won't be long before     
 we'll be in our golden years.  

19:51.323 --> 19:55.092
            "Golden years"!     
            I hate golden years.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.626
                  Don't talk    
             about that no more.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.695

this meatheaded pinko over here.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.131
The president's gonna take care 
of people like you and me.      

20:01.133 --> 20:03.267
  Didn't he push up the Social  
     Security five percent?     

20:03.269 --> 20:05.535
         While groceries went up
            20 percent.         

20:05.537 --> 20:06.937
Oh, what do you care?           

20:06.939 --> 20:08.672
That's just another 20 percent  
     you're eating free.        

20:08.674 --> 20:09.807
  Get away from me.             

20:09.809 --> 20:12.176
Oh, Archie, don't--             
            Get away from me.   

20:12.178 --> 20:14.244
Come on, it's just gonna        
be a couple of days.            

20:14.246 --> 20:17.781
          Would the two of youse
            get off of my back? 

20:19.050 --> 20:21.318
Uh, say, Mr. Quigley, there,    

20:21.320 --> 20:22.719
     I really got to            
tell you something--

20:23.755 --> 20:25.422

    your friend Joe?            

20:25.424 --> 20:26.423
                 I'll bet it is.

20:26.425 --> 20:27.657
        I'll answer it.         
        I'll answer it.         

20:27.659 --> 20:29.059
    I always answer the door

         in this house.         

20:30.796 --> 20:32.762
     And your friend Joe's      
         welcome here.          

20:32.764 --> 20:35.032
                    Hello.      

20:35.034 --> 20:37.000
Uh, who are you?                

20:37.002 --> 20:38.869
                  I'm Jo.       

20:51.149 --> 20:52.682
Jo, you look                    
prettier than ever.             

20:52.684 --> 20:54.617
            Oh, and you look    
              younger than ever.

20:54.619 --> 20:57.687
          I can lie just as good
                as you can.     

20:57.689 --> 20:59.289
         Hey, Quigley,          
      you mean to tell me       

20:59.291 --> 21:02.159
 this is the Jo you're planning 
 on sharing the apartment with? 

21:02.161 --> 21:03.560
Yep. Josephine.                 

21:03.562 --> 21:05.829
Jo, meet my friends,            
    the Bunkers.                

21:05.831 --> 21:07.597
                  How do you do?

21:07.599 --> 21:09.867
And this is Mrs. Bunker,        
    who rescued me.             

21:09.869 --> 21:12.202
          Oh, well, I'm so happy
            to know you.        

21:12.204 --> 21:13.536
          Oh, me too.           

21:13.538 --> 21:17.640
    Archie, ain't they          
        a lovely couple?        

21:17.642 --> 21:19.309
                 How do you mean
                    "couple"?   

21:19.311 --> 21:20.744
      They ain't married, Edith.
            Unless--            

21:20.746 --> 21:22.880
             Are you?           

21:22.882 --> 21:25.148
No, and we ain't gonna          
 get married either.            

21:25.150 --> 21:28.718
  If we did, there'd be no point
        in living together.     

21:33.691 --> 21:36.093
      At your age, talking      
     about living together?     

21:36.095 --> 21:38.028
    I'd be ashamed of myself    
         if I was you.          

21:38.030 --> 21:40.730
Oh, come on, sonny.             
Get with it.                    

21:40.732 --> 21:43.367
Do you know what'd happen       
if Jo and I got married?        

21:43.369 --> 21:46.236
                I'd lose half   
             my Social Security.

21:46.238 --> 21:48.805
That's the way the government's 
taking care of them, Arch.      

21:48.807 --> 21:51.474
      Oh, lay off the government
         over there, will you?  

21:51.476 --> 21:54.278
 I mean, I don't care personally
      if they live together.    

21:54.280 --> 21:55.612
         Let them live together.

21:55.614 --> 21:58.615
 I mean, after all, at your age,
    uh, what can you do?        

22:01.085 --> 22:04.321
                Just whatever   
                  comes to mind.

22:05.623 --> 22:06.890
    Well...                     

22:06.892 --> 22:08.591
I'll get                        
my hat and coat.                

22:08.593 --> 22:12.862
Justin, did you hear about      
  poor old Hazel Quinn?         

22:12.864 --> 22:13.897
                        No.     

22:13.899 --> 22:15.299
                  Don't tell me 
                she passed away.

22:15.301 --> 22:16.633
     Worse.                     

22:16.635 --> 22:17.901
She was picked up               
 for shoplifting                

22:17.903 --> 22:19.202
and thrown into jail.           

22:19.204 --> 22:22.672
     They can't put a good woman
          like that in jail.    

22:22.674 --> 22:24.308
  What are you talking about,   
            Quigley?            

22:24.310 --> 22:27.110
      Anybody that steals       
    deserves to be in jail.     

22:27.112 --> 22:31.081
Hazel Quinn is 78 years old,    
and she was hungry.             

22:31.083 --> 22:33.116
So she stole                    
  a can of tuna.                

22:33.118 --> 22:34.651
Chicken of the Sea.             

22:36.054 --> 22:37.854
It's a good thing the government
raised Social Security          

22:37.856 --> 22:39.622
five percent, right, Arch?      

22:39.624 --> 22:41.425
              Clam up, you.     

22:41.427 --> 22:42.892
    Well, we got to be          
        going now.              

22:42.894 --> 22:45.895
I sure want to thank you for the
 lovely way you took care of me.

22:45.897 --> 22:48.498
      I'd like to do something  
to sort of make it up to you.   

22:48.500 --> 22:50.867
             Give you one little
            piece of advice.    

22:50.869 --> 22:55.439
             One good turn      
    gets most of the blanket.   

22:55.441 --> 22:57.074
Oh!                             

23:04.415 --> 23:06.816
You're so clever.               

23:06.818 --> 23:08.051
              Oh, I'm not really
                  that smart,   

23:08.053 --> 23:10.854
             but people expect  
          an old man to be wise,

23:10.856 --> 23:12.956
            and I didn't want   
              to disappoint you.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.057
         Come on, Jo.           

23:14.059 --> 23:16.193
Well, let us know               
when you get settled.           

23:16.195 --> 23:18.761
We'd like to see                
both of you again.

to be new grandparents?

  I don't think                 
we got time.                    

23:27.905 --> 23:29.706
No, no, I mean,                 
like foster grandparents,       

23:29.708 --> 23:30.974
    for all of us.              

23:30.976 --> 23:33.843
        Oh, I don't need        
    no kind of grandparents.    

23:33.845 --> 23:37.214
  Come on, Daddy. I never knew  
  my real grandma and grandpa.  

23:37.216 --> 23:39.383
    Well, you wouldn't          
        have liked them.        

23:41.052 --> 23:42.552
  He don't mean that.           

23:42.554 --> 23:43.720
Well, I like                    
these two,

come visit us on holidays.

         Oh, what a lovely idea.

23:48.394 --> 23:49.592
                Thank you, dear.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.194
     Yeah, maybe sometimes      
      we can go visit you.      

23:51.196 --> 23:54.931
    Go as often as you can,     
        Meathead.

Well, Jo, it looks like         
we've just been adopted.        

23:57.602 --> 24:00.270
  Well, see you all             
next Christmas.                 

24:00.272 --> 24:02.772
  Hey, yeah, that's a good idea.
          Next Christmas.       

24:02.774 --> 24:04.641

one more piece of advice.

            And this is         
        just for you, sonny.    

24:10.882 --> 24:12.749
             Something my father
                 said to me.    

24:12.751 --> 24:15.919
            He said, "Son,      
        don't ever grow old."   

24:17.422 --> 24:19.456
What's that                     
supposed to mean?               

24:19.458 --> 24:22.125
