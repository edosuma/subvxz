00:06.407 --> 00:07.578
(Meredith) YOU WORK,

00:07.578 --> 00:10.541

YOU PREPARE...

00:10.541 --> 00:14.045
MONTHS AND YEARS
LEADING TO ONE DAY...

00:14.045 --> 00:16.317
THE DAY WHEN YOU STEP UP.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.449
(Richard) OKAY,
LET'S GET STARTED.

00:18.449 --> 00:21.292
YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

00:21.292 --> 00:23.224
GOT A LOT OF STANDING AROUND
TO DO TODAY.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.355
HE'S RIGHT, PEOPLE.

00:24.355 --> 00:26.297
STARTING TODAY,
FIFTH-YEAR RESIDENTS

00:26.297 --> 00:27.598
ROTATE IN AS LEAD SURGEONS.

00:27.598 --> 00:29.330
WE'VE ALERTED THE MORGUE.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.662
(all laugh)
ON THAT DAY, YOU HAVE TO
BE READY FOR ANYTHING.

00:31.662 --> 00:34.135
ATTENDINGS, YOU WILL OBSERVE
AND STAY SILENT.

00:34.135 --> 00:37.138
OFFER HELP ONLY WHEN
YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.709
YEAH,
BEFORE YOU HELP THEM SWIM,

00:38.709 --> 00:40.471
LET 'EM SINK A LITTLE.

00:40.471 --> 00:42.313
BUT THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN
NEVER QUITE PREPARE FOR...

00:42.313 --> 00:44.315
THE NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS--

00:44.315 --> 00:46.217
EFFECTIVE 9:00 A.M.

00:46.217 --> 00:47.778
I HAVE RESIGNED

00:50.451 --> 00:53.053
I WILL STAY

00:53.053 --> 00:56.157
I WILL TURN THIS MEETING OVER
TO THE NEW CHIEF OF SURGERY,

00:56.157 --> 00:57.688
DR. OWEN HUNT.

00:57.688 --> 01:00.231
THE DAY WHEN YOU STEP DOWN.

01:00.231 --> 01:01.492
THANKS, DR. WEBBER.

01:01.492 --> 01:04.265
I KNOW THIS COMES AS A SURPRISE
TO ALL OF YOU, TOO.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.167
AND I APPRECIATE,
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS,

01:06.167 --> 01:08.439

01:08.439 --> 01:11.342
UM, SO NOW I HAVE
YOUR CALL SCHEDULES,

01:11.342 --> 01:12.343
BUT I CAN HAVE THEM DIST--

01:12.343 --> 01:13.444
WAIT. WHAT HAPPENED?

01:13.444 --> 01:15.776
WHY DID IT HAPPEN?

01:15.776 --> 01:19.380
IS THIS THE BOARD? ARE THEY
FORCING YOU TO STEP DOWN?

01:19.380 --> 01:21.152
HMM?

01:21.152 --> 01:22.413
(Teddy) HUNT.

01:22.413 --> 01:24.185
YOU'RE THE NEW
CHIEF OF SURGERY.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.756
(giggles) NICE.

01:25.756 --> 01:27.258
(doctors speaking indistinctly)

01:27.258 --> 01:30.261
(siren wailing)

01:30.261 --> 01:32.693
(doctors continue
speaking indistinctly)

01:32.693 --> 01:35.496
(wailing continues)

01:37.368 --> 01:39.870
HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON?
ANYTHING NEW ON ZOLA?

01:39.870 --> 01:41.372
OH, NO. WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO HEAR YESTERDAY,

01:41.372 --> 01:42.533
AND THEN YESTERDAY,
THEY SAID TODAY,

01:42.533 --> 01:43.874
SO IS IT UP YET?

01:43.874 --> 01:45.336
OH, DON'T KNOW.
YOU OKAY?

01:45.336 --> 01:48.239
I HAVE NO CHOICE. I'M CLIPPING
MY FIRST ANEURYSM TODAY.

01:48.239 --> 01:50.341
WELL, I'VE GOT
A VALVE REPLACEMENT.

01:50.341 --> 01:51.712
MYVALVE REPLACEMENT.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.544
ALTMAN JUST HAS TO
SHUT UP AND WATCH.

01:53.544 --> 01:55.246
I HOPE I GET A GOOD O.R.

01:55.246 --> 01:56.217
IS IT UP YET?

01:56.217 --> 01:57.388
(Cristina and Meredith)
NOT YET.

01:57.388 --> 01:58.549
HEY,
YOU HEARD ABOUT ZOLA?

01:58.549 --> 01:59.720
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.891
AND SHE'S CLIPPING
HER FIRST ANEURYSM.

02:00.891 --> 02:02.253
ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT TO START

02:02.253 --> 02:03.224
WITH SOMETHING SIMPLER?

02:03.224 --> 02:04.455
YEAH,
LIKE JUGGLING CHAIN SAWS?

02:04.455 --> 02:05.696
OH, THANKS. THAT'S HELPING.

02:05.696 --> 02:06.857
HEY, IS IT UP YET?

02:06.857 --> 02:08.229
IS IT UP YET?

02:08.229 --> 02:09.330
IT'S GOING UP NOW.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.202
HEY, YOU HEARD ANYTHING?
HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.

02:11.202 --> 02:12.463
HOW ARE YOU EVEN HERE?

02:12.463 --> 02:14.265
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO,
AND I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING,

02:14.265 --> 02:15.636
SO I MIGHT AS WELL
DO THIS.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.408
(Cristina, Alex, April)
IT'S UP.

02:19.710 --> 02:21.672
(Cristina) O.R. 3. YES!

02:21.672 --> 02:24.615
MM. ILOVEO.R. 3.

02:24.615 --> 02:27.518
WAIT. BOWEL RESECTION?
I THOUGHT YOU HAD A PEDS CASE.

02:27.518 --> 02:28.519
(Alex) I SWITCHED LAST MINUTE.

02:28.519 --> 02:30.521
YOU CAN'T JUST SWITCH.

02:30.521 --> 02:32.583
OH, PLASTICS. I THOUGHT
YOU WERE THE GUNTHER.

02:32.583 --> 02:34.885
WASTING ALL YOUR CAPITAL
ON BOOB JOBS, HUH?

02:34.885 --> 02:36.257
IT'S A CLEFT LIP.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.588
I'M CHANGING
A KID'S LIFE TODAY.

02:37.588 --> 02:39.430
LOOK AT KEPNER,
SHE'S FIXING A BUM KNEE.

02:39.430 --> 02:40.661
OOH.
WAY TO SHOOT
FOR THE STARS, KID.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.263
(laughs)
OKAY, GUYS.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.864
UH, YOU ALSO START TEACHING
SKILLS LABS TODAY.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.866
I MADE UP A SCHEDULE
FOR THE MONTH.
(yawns)

02:45.866 --> 02:47.738
IT'S UP ON THE BOARD
IN MY OFFICE.

02:47.738 --> 02:49.600
IN YOUR WHAT?

02:53.604 --> 02:55.306
WHEN DID WE GET THIS?

02:55.306 --> 02:56.607
(April) UH,WEDIDN'T.
(Jackson whistles)

02:56.607 --> 02:58.609
IT'S FOR THE CHIEF RESIDENT,
ACTUALLY.

02:58.609 --> 03:00.851
THIS IS GOOD.
I CAN SLEEP ON THIS.

03:00.851 --> 03:02.883
YEAH, I GOT THAT ON craigslist.
IT'S--IT'S MINE.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.185
WE GOT A FRIDGE?

03:05.185 --> 03:06.787
(clatters and thuds)

03:06.787 --> 03:08.219
OKAY, GUYS.

03:08.219 --> 03:09.360
(chuckles)
UH, WHY IS MY NAME ON THIS?

03:09.360 --> 03:11.592
THESE ARE THIS MONTH'S
INTERN SKILLS LABS.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.294
EACH OF YOU HAS BEEN GIVEN
ONE SKILLS LAB TO TEACH.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.426
NO, I CAN'T TEACH TODAY.
I'M ON A MITRAL VALVE.

03:15.426 --> 03:18.329
OKAY, WELL, THEN JUST SWITCH
WITH ONE OF THESE GUYS.

03:18.329 --> 03:20.200
ANEURYSM.
BOWEL RESECTION.
I GOT A BABY'S FACE.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.932
GUYS, COME ON. I-I-I-I DIVIDED
THESE UP FAIRLY.

03:21.932 --> 03:23.904
YOU COME ON.
EVERY SURGERY WE DO THIS YEAR

03:23.904 --> 03:25.436
COULD END UP
ON THE ORAL BOARDS.

03:25.436 --> 03:27.638
AND THEY LOVE PICKING
THE CRAPPY OUTCOMES.

03:27.638 --> 03:29.310
THIS COULD AFFECT
WHICH FELLOWSHIP I GET.

03:29.310 --> 03:32.243
I MEAN, IT'S NOT JUST
LIFE OR DEATH, APRIL.

03:32.243 --> 03:33.544
NOW IT'S OUR CAREERS.
(cell phone alert chimes)

03:33.544 --> 03:34.785
(Meredith) OKAY,
HOW'S THIS?

03:34.785 --> 03:36.447
WHOEVER HAS
THE WORST OUTCOME TODAY

03:36.447 --> 03:37.948
TEACHES ALL THE SKILLS LABS
FOR THE WHOLE MONTH.

03:37.948 --> 03:39.620
THAT'S GOOD.
I'M IN.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.791
(scoffs)
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

03:40.791 --> 03:41.792
YOU GUYS GET THIS E-MAIL?

03:41.792 --> 03:43.354
YOU KNOW, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

03:43.354 --> 03:46.497
NO, NO, NO. THERE WILL BE NO
WAGERING ON PATIENT OUTCOMES.

03:46.497 --> 03:47.528
THAT--THAT--THAT'S AN ORDER.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.759
SO YOU'RE OUT, THEN?

03:48.759 --> 03:50.401
YOU KNOW, OKAY, JUST--
EVERYONE OUT OF MY OFFICE.

03:50.401 --> 03:51.562
WHOA.
WEBBER RESIGNED.

03:52.663 --> 03:55.306
HE'S NO LONGER
CHIEF OF SURGERY.

03:56.467 --> 03:59.440
DR. OWEN HUNT
IS NOW CHIEF OF SURGERY.

04:00.811 --> 04:03.474
WHAT?

04:07.878 --> 04:09.880
(exhales)

04:09.880 --> 04:11.251
(sighs)

04:11.251 --> 04:13.454
THAT THE ALZHEIMER'S TRIAL?

04:13.454 --> 04:14.685
HEARD FROM THE FDA?

04:14.685 --> 04:16.357
I'M SENDING IT TO PHOENIX.

04:16.357 --> 04:19.330
CARL BAUMANN IS TAKING OVER.
I'M BLACKLISTED.

04:19.330 --> 04:21.332
I MAY NEVER DO ANOTHER
CLINICAL TRIAL EVER AGAIN.

04:21.332 --> 04:23.263
YEAH, I'VE BEEN
BLACKLISTED, TOO.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.896
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA
LET THEM FIRE YOU?

04:25.896 --> 04:28.499
I FIRED MYSELF.

04:28.499 --> 04:30.441
IT'S ONE THING,
TAKING THE BLAME FOR MEREDITH

04:30.441 --> 04:32.673
AND LOSING THE TRIAL, BUT...

04:32.673 --> 04:34.475
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
TO YOURSELF?

04:34.475 --> 04:35.606
YOU KNOW, I CAME TO ASK
IF YOU HEARD ANYTHING

04:35.606 --> 04:36.847
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE GIRL?

04:36.847 --> 04:39.510
NO, I HAVE NOT.

04:40.811 --> 04:42.383
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.385
HOPE YOU HEAR SOON.

04:46.717 --> 04:49.520
HOW DOES HE NOT TELL ME
HE'S CHIEF OF SURGERY?

04:49.520 --> 04:51.422
WELL, IS IT BECAUSE YOU--

04:51.422 --> 04:52.723
DIDN'T HAVE HIS BABY?

04:52.723 --> 04:54.395
I MEAN,
HAS HE SAID ANYTHING?

04:54.395 --> 04:56.827
NO. WE HAVEN'T TALKED
ABOUT IT.

04:56.827 --> 04:58.369
AT ALL?

04:58.369 --> 04:59.670
IS THAT BAD?
THAT'S BAD, RIGHT?

04:59.670 --> 05:00.671
WELL, I MEAN, IT'S JUST--
(Owen) OH, HEY.

05:00.671 --> 05:02.833
OH, HEY.
UH, I-IS IT TRUE?

05:02.833 --> 05:05.376
UH... YEAH.

05:05.376 --> 05:07.037
OH, MY GOD. WHEN DID--

05:07.037 --> 05:08.539
WELL, UH, WEBBER TALKED
TO ME LAST NIGHT, BUT--

05:08.539 --> 05:10.310
I WAS GONNA TELL YOU,
BUT YOU WERE ALREADY ASLEEP,

05:10.310 --> 05:11.612
AND THEN THIS MORNING,
YOU HAD ALREADY GONE--

05:11.612 --> 05:13.684
OH, YEAH.
UM, M-MY MITRAL VALVE.

05:13.684 --> 05:15.315
RIGHT.RIGHT.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.316
RIGHT, SORRY.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.589
SORRY. GOOD LUCK.

05:18.589 --> 05:20.090
NO! NO. OH, GOD, YOU--

05:20.090 --> 05:22.393
YOU, YOU'RE THE...
UH, W--

05:22.393 --> 05:24.455
UH, THIS IS GREAT.
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.

05:24.455 --> 05:26.026
UH, I GUESS SO, YEAH.

05:26.026 --> 05:29.029
UM... DINNER?

05:29.029 --> 05:30.561
OH, MY SURGERY.

05:30.561 --> 05:32.633
MITRAL VALVE TAKES, LIKE,
A MINIMUM OF SEVEN HOURS.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.805
OH. SOMETIME.

05:34.805 --> 05:36.106
OKAY?

05:36.106 --> 05:38.068
I GOTTA...
OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

05:38.068 --> 05:39.069
THANKS.
CONGRATU--

05:39.069 --> 05:40.711
YEAH.
(laughs)

05:40.711 --> 05:42.342
CONGRATULATIONS.

05:43.644 --> 05:46.116
YEAH, THAT WAS BAD.

05:46.116 --> 05:47.748
(elevator bell dings)

05:47.748 --> 05:49.119
(indistinct conversations)

05:49.119 --> 05:51.482
HEY. I NEED AN INTERN TO ASSIST
ON MY BOWEL RESECTION.

05:51.482 --> 05:54.955
WELL, EVERYONE'S BOOKED,
SO GOOD LUCK FINDING SOMEONE.

05:54.955 --> 05:55.956
ISN'T THAT YOUR JOB?

05:55.956 --> 05:58.789
NO, MY JOB IS MAKING
THE SCHEDULE

05:58.789 --> 06:00.631
THAT YOU SCREWED UP.
AH, KAREV.

06:00.631 --> 06:02.993
UH, I JUST SAW THAT YOU
TURNED DOWN MY 3 MONTH OLD'S

06:02.993 --> 06:05.636
ESOPHAGEAL ATRESIA SURGERY
FOR WEBBER'S, UH...

06:08.799 --> 06:10.070
(snores)

06:10.070 --> 06:11.802
(elevator bell dings)
I'M--I'M SO SORRY.

06:11.802 --> 06:14.805
I WAS TRYING TO SAY
WEBBER'S BOWEL RESECTION,

06:14.805 --> 06:17.007
BUT THEN I FELL ASLEEP.
I JUST THOUGHT I COULD USE

06:17.007 --> 06:18.609
MORE PRACTICE
WITH BOWEL RESECTIONS.

06:18.609 --> 06:20.110
NO, YOU'RE TRYING TO PAD
YOUR BOARDS WITH GOOD OUTCOMES,

06:20.110 --> 06:21.482
SO YOU WENT FOR THE EASY "A."

06:21.482 --> 06:23.013
YOU KEEP THAT UP, AND YOU'RE
GONNA LOWBALL YOURSELF

06:23.013 --> 06:25.556
OUT OF THE FELLOWSHIP.

06:25.556 --> 06:27.017
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

06:27.017 --> 06:29.720
OR IS THIS ABOUT
WINNING THAT STUPID BET?

06:29.720 --> 06:31.061
JUST FIND ME AN INTERN.

06:31.061 --> 06:32.563
KAREV, YOU READY
FOR YOUR SURGERY?

06:32.563 --> 06:34.425
UH, I THINK SO, SIR.

06:34.425 --> 06:36.066
KEPNER'S HAVING A LITTLE
TROUBLE GETTING IT STAFFED.

06:36.066 --> 06:38.599
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? I'VE BEEN
TREATING SAM KENTON FOR YEARS.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.970
I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO POSTPONE HIM.

06:39.970 --> 06:41.532
UH, NO, SIR. NO, SIR.
I WILL FIND SOMEONE TO ASSIST.

06:41.532 --> 06:42.773
I'LL GET IT COVERED,

06:42.773 --> 06:44.735
(chuckling)
EVEN IF I HAVE TO DO IT MYSELF.

06:44.735 --> 06:46.437
WELL, GREAT.

06:46.437 --> 06:47.708
GREAT.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.640
(indistinct conversations)

06:49.640 --> 06:51.642
SO IF ROB'S OUT OF SURGERY,

06:51.642 --> 06:52.713
THEN I'LL PICK HIM UP
FROM SCHOOL,

06:52.713 --> 06:53.914
BUT IF NOT,
THEN I'LL TEXT YOU,

06:53.914 --> 06:55.646
AND YOU CAN DROP HIM
AT KATHY'S.

06:55.646 --> 06:57.618
YEAH, THANKS SO MUCH.
OKAY, BYE.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.119
(beep)
SORRY, I JUST...

06:59.119 --> 07:01.652
HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE GOT
THE KIDS SQUARED AWAY.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.454
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.
YOU HAVE KIDS?

07:03.454 --> 07:05.125
UH, LET'S GET BACK
TO YOUR SURGERY.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.997
SO I WILL LOCATE
THE ANEURYSM,

07:06.997 --> 07:09.500
WHICH IS THE BULGE
IN THE WALL OF YOUR ARTERY.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.162
AND THEN I WILL TAKE
A STEEL CLIP,

07:12.162 --> 07:13.934
WHICH IS LIKE
A TINY CLOTHESPIN,

07:13.934 --> 07:15.936
AND I'M GONNA PLACE IT ACROSS
THE NECK OF THE ANEURYSM.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.938
AND THAT WILL STOP
THE BLOOD SUPPLY.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.840
THAT WAY, WE DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT A RUPTURE.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.712
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IF YOU FIXED IT?

07:21.712 --> 07:22.943
WELL, WE DO WHAT WE CALL
A MATADOR MOVE.

07:22.943 --> 07:26.046
I'LL TAKE A NEEDLE, AND I POKE
THE DOME OF THE ANEURYSM.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.678
AND IF WE SEE
A TINY AMOUNT OF BLOOD,

07:27.678 --> 07:29.680
THEN WE KNOW
IT WAS SUCCESSFUL.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.653
AND IF IT WASN'T SUCCESSFUL,
IT BURSTS.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.984
POSSIBLY.

07:33.984 --> 07:35.986
AND I DIE.

07:35.986 --> 07:38.058
NOT IF I GET IT CLIPPED.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.560
AND WHAT'S YOUR SUCCESS RATE?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.061
HOW MANY HAVE YOU DONE?

07:43.664 --> 07:46.937
THIS WILL BE MY FIRST.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.203
I SORT OF WISH
YOU LIED ABOUT THAT.

07:53.203 --> 07:54.705
YEAH, WELL, AFTER TODAY,

07:54.705 --> 07:56.607
HER SUCCESS RATE WILL BE 100%.

07:56.607 --> 07:57.878
DR. GREY
IS THE BEST WE HAVE,

07:57.878 --> 07:59.680
AND I'LL BE THERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.751
DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

08:00.751 --> 08:02.082
(both) NO.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.584
(Rob) NO, THANKS.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.215
TRY AND REST EASY.

08:05.215 --> 08:06.486
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.487
OKAY.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.488
YEAH.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.620
THANK YOU.

08:11.622 --> 08:12.793
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.124
YEAH.

08:14.124 --> 08:15.666
(sighs)

08:15.666 --> 08:16.797
HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING
FROM THE SOCIAL WORKER?

08:16.797 --> 08:18.899
NO. HAVE YOU?
NO.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.230
I'M WORRIED, IF WE HAVEN'T
HEARD BACK BY NOW,

08:20.230 --> 08:21.772
THAT IT'S NOT GONNA GO
OUR WAY.

08:21.772 --> 08:22.673
WELL, I'LL CALL AGAIN.

08:22.673 --> 08:23.904
NO, DON'T.
WE'VE CALLED TOO MUCH.

08:23.904 --> 08:24.975
DEREK.

08:24.975 --> 08:26.907
YES.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.508
WHAT IF
WE DON'T GET ZOLA BACK?

08:28.508 --> 08:29.910
I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENS TO US?

08:29.910 --> 08:32.643
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
DO YOU WANT TO STAY TOGETHER?

08:32.643 --> 08:34.645
WE HAVE A SURGERY.

08:34.645 --> 08:36.747
LET'S JUST FOCUS ON THAT.

08:55.265 --> 08:57.307
(siren wailing)

08:57.307 --> 08:59.039
YOU.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.172
RUTH BENNET, 50, MITRAL VALVE
REPLACEMENT PATIENT,

09:02.172 --> 09:04.114
COMPLAINED OVERNIGHT
OF STOMACH PAINS.

09:04.114 --> 09:05.746
THESE STOMACH PAINS,
WHAT DID YOU DO?

09:05.746 --> 09:06.947
YOU.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.318
WE TESTED HER CARDIAC ENZYMES,
RAN AN ECHO.

09:08.318 --> 09:09.580
BOTH WERE NORMAL.

09:09.580 --> 09:10.651
DID ANYONE
TOUCH HER STOMACH?

09:18.558 --> 09:19.329
(slaps table)

09:19.329 --> 09:21.061
NO ONE TOUCHED THE PATIENT?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.562
ARE YOU GUYS THE SLOW CLASS?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.294
PALPATING THE PATIENT'S ABDOMEN
IS FIRST,

09:24.294 --> 09:25.936
BEFORE TESTS OR LABS.

09:25.936 --> 09:28.268
BASICS, PEOPLE.
FUNDAMENTALS.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.300
I'M ALL ABOUT
NOT SKIPPING STEPS.

09:31.602 --> 09:32.773
OW.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.344
OH, SORRY.

09:34.344 --> 09:36.346
DOES IT HURT MORE OR LESS
WHEN I TAKE MY HAND AWAY?

09:36.346 --> 09:37.347
M-MORE.

09:37.347 --> 09:38.949
SEE? BASICS.

09:38.949 --> 09:41.311
YOU SHOULD BE DOING THIS
IN YOUR SLEEP.

09:41.311 --> 09:45.255
TAKE, UH, MRS. BENNET
FOR A TRIPLE-CONTRAST C.T.

09:45.255 --> 09:47.157
TRY NOT TO GET LOST.

09:47.157 --> 09:50.691
(telephone rings in distance)

09:50.691 --> 09:51.992
HE JUST SEEMS SO LITTLE.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.794
I MEAN,
I THOUGHT IT COULD WAIT.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.726
I UNDERSTAND,
BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT NOW

09:55.726 --> 09:57.768
IS THE RIGHT TIME.
(coos)

09:57.768 --> 10:00.000
BY FIXING THOSE MUSCLES EARLY,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.002
HIS MAXILLA,
HIS WHOLE UPPER JAW,

10:02.002 --> 10:05.776
WILL HAVE A REAL SHOT
AT FORMING PROPERLY.

10:05.776 --> 10:07.638
BUT HE'LL HAVE A SCAR?

10:07.638 --> 10:09.910
WELL, I'M GONNA DO WHAT'S CALLED
A STRAIGHT-LINE REPAIR.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.242
SO THAT'LL LEAVE A LITTLE SCAR,
WHICH I'LL HIDE

10:12.242 --> 10:14.815
RIGHT IN THE CONTOUR
OF HIS LIP RIGHT HERE.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.688
AND THEN OVER TIME,
IT'LL FADE ALTOGETHER.

10:17.688 --> 10:19.650
SHOULDN'T EVEN BE NOTICEABLE.

10:19.650 --> 10:21.121
THEN HE'LL LOOK
EVEN MORE HANDSOME

10:21.121 --> 10:22.953
THAN HE DOES RIGHT NOW,
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.

10:22.953 --> 10:24.795
(laughs) HE IS
A PRETTY HANDSOME GUY,

10:24.795 --> 10:26.126
ISN'T HE?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.058
HE CERTAINLY IS.
YES, YOU ARE.

10:28.058 --> 10:29.860
YOU WANT TO WAIT HERE
WITH YOUR MAMA

10:29.860 --> 10:31.261
WHILE I GO GET YOU
ALL SET UP?

10:31.261 --> 10:32.733
YEAH?

10:32.733 --> 10:34.705
I'LL COME BACK THIS AFTERNOON,
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY?

10:34.705 --> 10:36.636
THANK YOU, DR. AVERY.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.168
MY PLEASURE.

10:38.168 --> 10:39.940
HE'LL DO GREAT.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.041
(coos)

10:41.041 --> 10:42.112
HEY.

10:42.112 --> 10:43.413
EXCELLENT.

10:43.413 --> 10:44.845
YOU COULDN'T
HAVE BEEN CLEARER,

10:44.845 --> 10:45.846
YOU ANSWERED HER QUESTIONS,

10:45.846 --> 10:47.647
YOU EASED HER FEARS.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.749
THANKS. THAT'S, UM--

10:48.749 --> 10:51.281
MARK SLOAN'S GONNA DO
THE SURGERY, THOUGH.

10:51.281 --> 10:52.783
HOW'S THAT?

10:52.783 --> 10:55.055
IT'S NOT YOU. YOU'RE GREAT.
YOU'RE THE GUNTHER.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.687
BUT YOU'RE PLANNING
A STRAIGHT-LINE REPAIR,

10:56.687 --> 10:58.689
AND I'D RATHER THE KID GET
A MILLARD ROTATION

10:58.689 --> 11:00.060
SO THAT WE DON'T RISK
THE LIP SHORTENING OVER TIME.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.062
BUT I WAS ACTUALLY--
FOR THE KID'S SAKE,

11:02.062 --> 11:03.734
I-I GOTTA HAVE SLOAN DO IT.

11:03.734 --> 11:04.865
HE'S--HE'S AN ARTIST.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.036
DR. ROBBINS, UH,

11:06.036 --> 11:07.768
IT'S MY PROCEDURE.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.099
I'M SORRY, AVERY.

11:09.099 --> 11:11.241
JUST NOT THIS TIME.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.106
UH, THIS IS SAM KENTON, 55.

11:16.106 --> 11:17.748
HE'S HERE
FOR A BOWEL RESECTION

11:17.748 --> 11:19.880
DUE TO
CHRONIC MESENTERIC ISCHEMIA.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.212
THIS IS SAM'S THIRD SURGERY
WITH US.

11:22.212 --> 11:23.984
(chuckles)
THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.986
AND THIS IS
SAM'S SON JASON.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.758
JASON SHOULD BE IN SCHOOL

11:27.758 --> 11:29.119
INSTEAD OF HERE,
PLAYING NURSEMAID.

11:29.119 --> 11:31.461
IT'S ONE SEMESTER. THINK HOW
MUCH MONEY I'M SAVING YOU.

11:31.461 --> 11:33.293
WELL, I'M WORRIED, YOU'RE NOT
GETTING ANY SMARTER.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.395
KID'S NOT VERY SMART.
(laughs)

11:35.395 --> 11:37.397
WONDER WHERE I GET
THAT FROM.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.929
DID HE
JUST CALL ME STUPID?

11:38.929 --> 11:40.430
(April) I THINK HE DID.
(laughs)

11:40.430 --> 11:42.472
(chuckles) SAM'S BEEN
DR. WEBBER'S PATIENT SINCE--

11:42.472 --> 11:44.905
KEPNER, JUST GIVE ME
THE BULLET, OKAY?

11:47.707 --> 11:48.979
(April clears throat)

11:48.979 --> 11:50.480
SAM KENTON, 55,

11:50.480 --> 11:53.043
PRESENTS WITH
CHRONIC MESENTERIC ISCHEMIA.

11:53.043 --> 11:55.485
UM, NONRESPONSIVE
TO REVASCULARIZATION.

11:55.485 --> 11:58.088
SCHEDULED FOR
AN EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY

11:58.088 --> 12:01.351
AND POSSIBLE BOWEL RESECTION.

12:02.492 --> 12:04.024
(Arizona) OH, IT'S SO SAD.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.495
I MEAN, HOW MANY YEARS
WAS HE CHIEF FOR?

12:05.495 --> 12:06.456
11.

12:06.456 --> 12:07.858
I MEAN, ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO ALL PRETEND

12:07.858 --> 12:09.229
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

12:09.229 --> 12:10.400
OH, WHY DID HE COVER
FOR HER?

12:10.400 --> 12:11.902
I MEAN, WHAT'S HIS DEAL
WITH HER?

12:11.902 --> 12:13.163
(Miranda) D-D--

12:13.163 --> 12:14.805
HEY.
(Arizona and Teddy) HI.

12:14.805 --> 12:16.206
GOOD MORNING, LADIES.

12:16.206 --> 12:19.739
(whistling)

12:19.739 --> 12:22.012
UH, UH, SO WHAT'S
THE SYSTEM HERE?

12:22.012 --> 12:23.914
DOES EVERYBODY HAVE A SPOT
OR--

12:23.914 --> 12:25.415
OH, ANYWHERE IS FINE.

12:25.415 --> 12:26.947
OH, ALL RIGHT, THEN.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.949
RIGHT... HERE.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.782
AND I WILL SEE YOU
THIS AFTERNOON.

12:32.783 --> 12:34.484
YOU ALL HAVE AN EXCELLENT DAY.

12:34.484 --> 12:36.756
YOU, TOO.
ALREADY AM.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.188
(Arizona and Teddy chuckle)

12:40.490 --> 12:42.192
(whispers) I MEAN,
HE'S TRYING SO HARD.

12:42.192 --> 12:44.394
HE TALKED TO HIS SANDWICH.

12:44.394 --> 12:47.367
(sighs deeply)

12:47.367 --> 12:48.768
WELL, WHAT ARE--

12:48.768 --> 12:50.370
UH, DOCTOR--UH, SORRY.
CHIEF.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.002
UM, LARRY JENNINGS SENT YOU
THIS BOTTLE OF SCOTCH

12:52.002 --> 12:53.503
TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS.
OOH.

12:53.503 --> 12:55.245
OH. THANKS. JUST, UH,
PUT IT SOMEWHERE.

12:55.245 --> 12:56.776
OKAY. UH, AND, DR. TORRES,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.348
I NEED TO PUSH
MY MENISCUS REPAIR TO TOMORROW.

12:58.348 --> 12:59.810
I HAVE TO TEACH
A SKILLS LAB.

12:59.810 --> 13:01.551
A SKILLS LAB
OVER A SURGERY?
(clears throat)

13:01.551 --> 13:03.213
YEAH, AND THEN
I HAVE TO ASSIST KAREV...
UH...

13:03.213 --> 13:04.384
ON A BOWEL RESECTION.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.555
YOU SHOULD BE DELEGATING
THAT STUFF.

13:05.555 --> 13:07.287
I TRIED, BUT NO ONE
WOULD COVER IT.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.119
DON'T TRY, KEPNER.
JUST ORDER THEM.

13:09.119 --> 13:11.061
LEADERSHIP ISN'T ABOUT
MAKING FRIENDS.

13:11.061 --> 13:12.823
OH, WELL,
THEN I'M DOING IT RIGHT. MM.

13:12.823 --> 13:14.224
(elevator bell dings)

13:14.224 --> 13:15.565
THAT WAS NICE.
VERY CHIEF-Y.

13:15.565 --> 13:16.566
MM.

13:16.566 --> 13:18.528
DR. HUNT.

13:18.528 --> 13:20.070
MAY I HAVE
MY CALL SCHEDULE, PLEASE?

13:20.070 --> 13:21.832
SORRY?
MY CALL SCHEDULE,

13:21.832 --> 13:24.004
WHICH I USUALLY GET AT THE STAFF
MEETING, BUT I DIDN'T,

13:24.004 --> 13:25.535
BECAUSE YOU SAID
YOU WOULD DISTRIBUTE THEM,

13:25.535 --> 13:27.407
BUT YOU HAVEN'T,
SO I HAD TO COME FIND YOU,

13:27.407 --> 13:29.409
AND YOU'RE NOT VERY EASY
TO FIND,

13:29.409 --> 13:31.541
NOT UNLIKE MY CALL SCHEDULE.

13:31.541 --> 13:33.884
SO MAY I HAVE
MY CALL SCHEDULE, PLEASE?

13:33.884 --> 13:35.115
J--OF COURSE.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.546
I--JUST AS SOON AS--

13:36.546 --> 13:39.249
THANK YOU.

13:39.249 --> 13:41.251
THAT WAS
WAY LESS CHIEF-Y THERE.

13:41.251 --> 13:43.223
OKAY. WHAT DID I DO?

13:43.223 --> 13:44.294
OH, NOTHING. NOTHING.

13:44.294 --> 13:45.495
SHE WAS
WEBBER'S RIGHT-HAND MAN.

13:45.495 --> 13:46.927
SHE'D HATE ANYONE
IN YOUR POSITION.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.358
(exhales)

13:48.358 --> 13:49.860
YEAH,

13:49.860 --> 13:51.531
I KNOW IT'S NOT ABOUT
MAKING FRIENDS,

13:51.531 --> 13:53.833
BUT YOU REALLY WANT BAILEY
AS YOUR ENEMY?

13:53.833 --> 13:57.267
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

13:57.267 --> 13:59.870
(Teddy speaks indistinctly)

13:59.870 --> 14:00.971
I WAS RIGHT.

14:00.971 --> 14:02.973
RUTH BENNET'S SCANS
SHOW APPENDICITIS.

14:02.973 --> 14:04.574
THE MORONS MISSED IT.
I'M TURFING HER

14:04.574 --> 14:06.576
TO GENERAL SURGERY
FOR AN APPENDECTOMY.

14:06.576 --> 14:08.578
WHY DON'T YOU DO THE APPY?

14:09.950 --> 14:11.281
WHERE DO I START?

14:11.281 --> 14:13.523
BECAUSE IT'S GENERAL SURGERY,
AND I'M ON CARDIO.

14:13.523 --> 14:16.086
BECAUSE IT'S FIRST-YEAR SURGERY,
AND I'M A FIFTH YEAR.

14:16.086 --> 14:17.087
BECAUSE--

14:17.087 --> 14:18.158
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS GREAT.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.359
I MEAN, RUTH HAS
A HEART CONDITION,

14:19.359 --> 14:20.860
AND WE HAVE TO
MONITOR HER ANYWAY.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.193
AND BECAUSE OF HER C.O.P.D.,
SHE HAS TO HAVE AN OPEN APPY,

14:23.193 --> 14:25.896
AND WE DON'T WANT
SOME MORON DOING IT.

14:25.896 --> 14:27.867
AND YOU GET A PROCEDURE.
THANK YOU.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.539
IT'S A VERY BASIC PROCEDURE.

14:29.539 --> 14:31.501
BUT YOU LOVE THE BASICS.

14:31.501 --> 14:33.503
AND YOU'RE ALL ABOUT
THEFUNDAMENTALS.

14:33.503 --> 14:34.945
(elevator bell dings)

14:34.945 --> 14:36.947
(doors open)

14:38.308 --> 14:39.910
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING,

14:39.910 --> 14:42.282
UM, JUST ABOUT HIS RECOVERY,

14:42.282 --> 14:45.615
SPECIFICALLY THE, LIKE,
BATHROOM PART?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.891
WILL I NEED TO BE
IN THERE WITH HIM?

14:51.891 --> 14:54.094
'CAUSE MY MOM WAS HERE FOR
HIS OTHER SURGERIES, AND--

14:54.094 --> 14:55.465
RIGHT.

14:55.465 --> 14:58.028
I'LL DO IT. I'LL TOTALLY DO
WHATEVER HE NEEDS.

14:58.028 --> 15:00.630
I JUST WANT TO BE PREPARED,
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE...

15:00.630 --> 15:03.303
HE'LL BE EMBARRASSED
AND I'LL...

15:03.303 --> 15:05.936
(sighs) WELL, NEITHER OF US
IS GONNA LIKE IT.

15:05.936 --> 15:07.307
YEAH, THERE, UM,

15:07.307 --> 15:09.409
THERE ARE A COUPLE
OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.641
AND IT ALL JUST SORT OF DEPENDS
ON WHAT DR. KAREV FINDS

15:11.641 --> 15:13.343
DURING SURGERY.

15:13.343 --> 15:15.345
SO I'LL JUST--
I'LL HAVE HIM COME

15:15.345 --> 15:17.287
AND--AND TALK YOU
THROUGH THEM, OKAY?

15:17.287 --> 15:19.289
IS THAT GUY COOL?

15:19.289 --> 15:22.652
HE SEEMS A LITTLE...
DOUCHEY.

15:22.652 --> 15:25.655
HE'S GOOD, VERY GOOD.

15:25.655 --> 15:27.657
HE CAN BE A LITTLE DOUCHEY...

15:27.657 --> 15:30.230
(inhales deeply)

23:38.918 --> 23:42.722
I AM THOROUGHLY ENJOYING
THIS BOOK, KAREV.

23:42.722 --> 23:45.054
THAT'S GREAT.

23:45.054 --> 23:46.926
HOPEFULLY,
I'LL FINISH IT IN THERE,

23:46.926 --> 23:48.928
BECAUSE AS LONG
AS I'M READING,

23:48.928 --> 23:51.200
IT MEANS THAT
YOU'RE NOT SCREWING UP.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.702
WILL I FINISH
THIS BOOK TODAY?

23:52.702 --> 23:53.863
YES, SIR.

23:53.863 --> 23:55.965
ALL RIGHT.

23:55.965 --> 23:58.007
(sighs)

23:58.007 --> 23:59.939
(door hisses open)

24:02.972 --> 24:04.674
HAVE YOU GOT
THE PRE-OP SCANS?

24:04.674 --> 24:05.845
I ALREADY LOOKED THEM OVER.

24:05.845 --> 24:06.846
I WANT TO LOOK AGAIN.

24:08.177 --> 24:10.049
I THINK YOU SHOULD DO
THE SURGERY.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.481
WHY?

24:11.481 --> 24:14.053
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT A TEAM
RIGHT NOW.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.657
WHAT HAPPENS
IF THE ANEURYSM RUPTURES?

24:17.657 --> 24:18.828
PUT A TEMPORARY CLIP
ON THE FEEDING ARTERY.

24:18.828 --> 24:20.459
AND IF THE ANEURYSM
STILL BLEEDS?

24:20.459 --> 24:21.831
I GAIN CONTROL OF
THE COMMON CAROTID IN THE NECK.

24:21.831 --> 24:23.593
WHAT KIND OF CLIP
ARE YOU GONNA GO WITH?

24:23.593 --> 24:24.794
I WON'T KNOW
TILL I GET IN THERE.

24:24.794 --> 24:26.496
(inhales deeply)

24:26.496 --> 24:27.867
YOU'RE READY.
LET'S GO.

24:33.543 --> 24:36.546
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:42.011 --> 24:44.053
(speaks indistinctly)

24:44.053 --> 24:45.484
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.717
(whispering)
YOU'RE THE LEAD SURGEON.

24:47.717 --> 24:49.559
YOU'RE ON THAT SIDE.

24:49.559 --> 24:53.092
(chuckles) YEAH.

24:56.025 --> 24:57.867
(beeping continues)

24:57.867 --> 25:00.730
YOU PRACTICED IT
THE OTHER WAY, DIDN'T YOU?

25:00.730 --> 25:03.172
(beeping continues)

25:03.172 --> 25:05.274
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

25:05.274 --> 25:06.606
NO, SIR.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.608
10-BLADE.

25:08.608 --> 25:11.240
(beeping continues)

25:11.240 --> 25:13.743
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

25:13.743 --> 25:15.745
ARE WE STILL DOING THE THING
WHERE I HAVE TO TELL YOU

25:15.745 --> 25:17.216
EVERY LITTLE MOVE--

25:17.216 --> 25:19.148
NEVER GETS OLD.

25:19.148 --> 25:20.550
(beeping continues)

25:20.550 --> 25:22.251
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

25:22.251 --> 25:25.294
BLUNT SEPARATION
OF THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES.

25:25.294 --> 25:26.726
NEAT.

25:28.598 --> 25:31.300
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:31.300 --> 25:33.833
(exhales deeply)

25:33.833 --> 25:35.835
YOU KNOW, YOU--
YOU HAVE A KID

25:35.835 --> 25:38.307
AND YOU--YOU WORRY A LOT
ABOUT SCREWING 'EM UP.

25:38.307 --> 25:41.240
LIKE SOMETHING
THAT YOU DO OR SAY

25:41.240 --> 25:44.043
OR SOMETHING YOU DON'T SAY
WILL CHANGE 'EM FOREVER.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.615
YES, MA'AM.

25:45.615 --> 25:47.577
I WAS JUST THINKING THAT
YOU'RE TOTALLY DETERMINING

25:47.577 --> 25:49.078
THE COURSE
OF THIS KID'S LIFE.

25:49.078 --> 25:50.620
YOU WILL DETERMINE
WHETHER OR NOT

25:50.620 --> 25:52.652
THIS KID GETS MADE FUN OF
FOR HIS LOOKS,

25:52.652 --> 25:56.025
OR IF HE CRIES AT HIS
SCHOOL PICTURE EVERY YEAR.

25:56.025 --> 25:57.757
AND TODAY YOU WILL DECIDE...

25:57.757 --> 25:59.989
(sighs) WHO HE GOES
TO THE PROM WITH,

25:59.989 --> 26:02.061
AND WHO HE WILL MARRY

26:02.061 --> 26:04.093
OR IF--I MEAN, IF HE
GETS MARRIED AT ALL,

26:04.093 --> 26:06.766
OR IF HE DIES ALONE,

26:06.766 --> 26:10.169
UNATTRACTIVE
AND UNLOVED.

26:10.169 --> 26:13.342
(beeping continues)

26:13.342 --> 26:17.076
(exhales deeply)

26:17.076 --> 26:19.709
DID--DID YOU WANT ME
TO CALL SLOAN?

26:19.709 --> 26:22.211
(beeping continues)

26:22.211 --> 26:24.083
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:24.083 --> 26:25.885
OKAY, I'VE ISOLATED
THE ANEURYSM.

26:25.885 --> 26:28.117
I CAN SEE THE WHOLE NECK.

26:28.117 --> 26:31.120
(beeping continues)

26:35.665 --> 26:37.627
WHAT IS THAT?

26:37.627 --> 26:40.299
IT'S AN ANGLED
7 MILLIMETER.

26:40.299 --> 26:41.801
I'D GO SMALLER,
USE A STRAIGHT ONE.

26:41.801 --> 26:42.972
NO.
NO?

26:42.972 --> 26:44.103
YOU ONLY GET
ONE SHOT AT THIS.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.705
USE A SMALLER CLIP.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.606
I MAY NEED
THE EXTRA LENGTH.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.108
YOU COULD HIT
ONE OF THE PERFORATORS.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.239
NOT IF I LOOK
WHERE I'M GOING.

26:50.239 --> 26:51.881
PUT THE CLIP DOWN.

26:51.881 --> 26:54.083
(beeping continues)

26:54.083 --> 26:56.646
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

26:58.347 --> 27:00.019
I AM ISOLATING
THE APPENDIX.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.952
AND NOW?

27:02.952 --> 27:06.796
I AM CROSS-CLAMPING
THE APPENDIX AT THE BASE.

27:06.796 --> 27:08.658
AND WHAT
ARE YOU DOING NOW?

27:21.410 --> 27:23.412
OKAY, YOU CAN GET
AS PISSED AS YOU WANT,

27:23.412 --> 27:25.374
BUT THERE IS A REASON THAT
I'M HAVING YOU DO ALL THIS.

27:25.374 --> 27:27.076
I WANT TO--
SHH.

27:27.076 --> 27:28.347
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

27:28.347 --> 27:30.149
I DON'T--I-I...

27:32.221 --> 27:34.754
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT COMES NEXT.

27:39.358 --> 27:41.731
(Alex)
ANASTOMOSIS IS HOLDING.

27:41.731 --> 27:43.662
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:43.662 --> 27:45.434
NICE WORK.

27:45.434 --> 27:48.698
OKAY. WE GOTTA RUN
THE BOWEL.

27:48.698 --> 27:50.339

I AM TALKING ABOUT.
ENLARGE WITH SCISSORS...

28:03.913 --> 28:05.715
WHY WOULD I HAVE YOU REPLACE...
DELIVER THE APPENDIX...

28:05.715 --> 28:06.916
A MITRAL VALVE...
CROSS-CLAMP--

28:06.916 --> 28:07.987
WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN
REMEMBER A--
CROSS-CLAMP--

28:07.987 --> 28:09.889
I CAN IF YOU JUSTPLEASE
SHUT UP.

28:12.822 --> 28:14.463
I CAN'T TELL
IF ANY OF THIS IS VIABLE.

28:14.463 --> 28:16.695
WELL, WHAT ABOUT HERE?
I MEAN, THIS LOOKS--
NO, IT'S CRAP.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.167

28:29.038 --> 28:30.880
I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT IT,
DEREK.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.281
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

28:32.281 --> 28:33.783
NO, I'VE DONE IT
HUNDREDS OF TIMES.

28:33.783 --> 28:34.784
USE A SMALLER CLIP.

28:34.784 --> 28:38.748

OKAY, EVERYBODY, STOP.

29:37.146 --> 29:38.277

29:50.089 --> 29:52.822
WELL, YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THIS
THE NEXT TIME

29:52.822 --> 29:55.324
YOU'RE SCREAMING AT AN INTERN
FOR SKIPPING THE FUNDAMENTALS.

29:55.324 --> 29:57.466
WILL YOU JUST DO IT,
PLEASE?

29:57.466 --> 29:59.228
TAKE YOUR TIME.

29:59.228 --> 30:01.030

30:10.309 --> 30:11.810
OH, DON'T TRY TO MAKE THIS
ABOUT ME.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.312
OKAY, THEN TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.214
YOU SHOULD KNOW
WHAT TO DO.
SO SHOULD YOU.

30:15.214 --> 30:16.946

WELL, I NEED YOUR HELP.
