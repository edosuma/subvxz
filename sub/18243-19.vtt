We cooked a counter spell

supposed to neutralize
the ignore me spell

16:04.267 --> 16:06.182

Noelle put us under.

Right. But instead of
making things go back
to normal,

we ended up becoming
the center of attention.

counter anything,

16:14.103 --> 16:15.713

a normal spell.

we were never cursed

You got me.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.551
It's very impressive.

But just because
I didn't spell you
last time,

doesn't mean
I can't or I won't.

Wait. She's spelling
her food?

My name's Hannah.

22:08.239 --> 22:10.459
Shannon.
I've seen you around.

22:10.546 --> 22:12.069
How do you like
Fox Canyon so far?

22:12.156 --> 22:14.463
Um, it's okay,
I guess.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.032
Except for the food.

22:18.119 --> 22:20.339
Yeah. It's best to
stick with the fries.

22:28.216 --> 22:29.522
Pretty day to be
out gettin' votes, huh?

22:29.609 --> 22:32.481
[chuckles]
I'm glad I ran into you.

22:32.568 --> 22:34.831
Why? Do you want to put
my picture on your website?

22:34.918 --> 22:37.138
"Terri Quinn,
addicted to caffeine."

22:37.225 --> 22:39.793
Look,
I want to apologize for
what happened with Kelly.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.142
I did not
authorize that,

22:41.229 --> 22:43.492
and I promise I will fire
whoever did this.

22:43.579 --> 22:45.276
No, you did it, Adam.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.843
That's as low
as it gets.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.715
Kids are off limits.

22:48.802 --> 22:49.803
You're right.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.457
You're right.

22:51.544 --> 22:52.588
I'm sorry, Terri.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.982
I just really
want to be mayor.

22:55.069 --> 22:57.376
And I'm gonna do
whatever I have to do.

22:57.463 --> 22:58.899
Well, you do
what you want.

22:58.986 --> 23:00.944
But I'm still running
a clean campaign.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.337
Because when I go home
to my family,

23:02.424 --> 23:03.730
they're proud of me.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.384
And I'm not losing that
because of you.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.041
And I am going to
defeat you.

23:16.699 --> 23:18.092
[bell jingles]

23:18.179 --> 23:21.008
I can't believe
Saphron is open again.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.749
It didn't seem busy.

23:22.836 --> 23:25.273
Hey, Mama P.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.579
Hi, girls.
The usual?

23:26.666 --> 23:27.754
Yes, please.

23:27.841 --> 23:30.191
What happened last night
with Noelle?

23:30.278 --> 23:31.888
Noelle?

23:31.975 --> 23:33.977
You were gonna
talk to her about
her magical popovers.

23:34.064 --> 23:36.240
Magical?

23:36.327 --> 23:38.982
I've heard they're good,
but I wouldn't call them
magical.

23:41.028 --> 23:44.118
So, you don't remember
talking to Noelle?

23:44.205 --> 23:46.163
Pretty sure
I'd remember it.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.601
Yeah. Me, too.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.733
Is the rosemary plant
still in the pantry?

23:50.820 --> 23:52.692
Who keeps a rosemary plant
in the pantry?

23:52.779 --> 23:54.433
I wish I had
a pantry.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.957
[chuckles]
Have you seen how tight
it is back there?

23:57.044 --> 23:59.873
Mama P,
you do have a pantry.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.657
A secret pantry.

24:03.224 --> 24:05.922
If I do, then it's
a secret to me.

24:06.009 --> 24:08.403
Livonian?

24:08.490 --> 24:10.013
Elysian?

24:10.100 --> 24:11.232
Morbium?

24:11.319 --> 24:14.322
Are you speaking English?

24:14.409 --> 24:16.455
Have a seat.
Be right back with
your smoothies.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.894
Mama P doesn't
remember magic.

24:20.981 --> 24:23.070
She's been spelled,
just like RJ.

24:23.157 --> 24:24.985
And we know
who did it.

24:25.072 --> 24:26.160
All: Noelle.
