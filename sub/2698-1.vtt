02:58.000 --> 02:59.561
Quiet night, boys?

02:59.985 --> 03:00.966
Yes, sir.

03:05.329 --> 03:07.368
Gentlemen, we owe a quarterly.

03:08.529 --> 03:11.146
Vault 23, encryption download.

03:14.768 --> 03:15.816
Loaded.

03:16.049 --> 03:18.023
Level five. Sonic, please.

03:18.864 --> 03:19.660
Stable.

03:20.176 --> 03:21.257
Motion.

03:23.824 --> 03:24.839
Stable.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.276
Status check, please.

03:32.080 --> 03:32.876
All secure.

03:34.385 --> 03:35.530
Excellent.

03:36.913 --> 03:38.341
Carry on, gentlemen.

03:52.401 --> 03:55.270
-Come on. Come on!
-What're you doing, man?

04:00.945 --> 04:02.952
All right. All right, we're here.

04:03.346 --> 04:05.898
What restaurant is this?
Where the front door at?

04:06.097 --> 04:08.431
We go in the back.
It's like VIP, you know?

04:08.624 --> 04:11.243
Only cool people go in the back,
like Madonna...

04:11.441 --> 04:13.350
...and Dennis Rodman
and Gary Coleman.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.716
It's real controversial stars
coming in this place.

04:16.945 --> 04:18.024
All right.

04:19.088 --> 04:20.036
I'm not doing it.

04:20.273 --> 04:21.800
All we gotta do is knock this off.

04:22.033 --> 04:25.448
We'll get a couple of grand.
I been casing this joint for months.

04:25.649 --> 04:26.445
Look.

04:26.673 --> 04:28.648
You been casing it
and got one picture?

04:28.850 --> 04:30.856
Film is expensive. Look at that.

04:31.057 --> 04:35.334
Shrimp? You on parole and you here
trying to go back for stealing shrimp?

04:35.537 --> 04:38.221
Not shrimps, baby. Prawns.

04:38.418 --> 04:39.847
What the fuck is a prawn?

04:40.049 --> 04:44.010
A prawn is bigger than shrimp. You
ever order a jumbo shrimp cocktail?

04:44.210 --> 04:46.697
And they real big
like they been working out?

04:46.897 --> 04:48.654
Like they on steroids?
That's prawns.

04:48.881 --> 04:51.532
Eating one prawn,
that's like five or six shrimp.

04:51.761 --> 04:53.965
Yeah, right.
I'm going back to the truck.

04:54.162 --> 04:56.878
Fredo did the same thing to Michael
in The Godfather.

04:57.073 --> 04:59.015
''Fredo, don't ever go
against the family.

04:59.218 --> 05:01.934
Don't disrespect me and my father.
Get the fuck out here!''

06:15.123 --> 06:16.748
You're deviating.

06:18.931 --> 06:19.977
Give me a second.

06:22.610 --> 06:24.520
We don't have a second.

06:25.490 --> 06:26.897
Go back to the truck.

06:27.091 --> 06:29.001
I'll finish up here.

06:36.370 --> 06:37.451
Glove.

07:34.323 --> 07:37.007
Ninety seconds. Perfect.

07:39.892 --> 07:41.801
Send down the lift.

07:46.131 --> 07:47.244
Yeah.

07:48.948 --> 07:50.093
I don't think so.

07:50.420 --> 07:53.616
What? What are you talking about?

07:54.196 --> 07:58.288
The first conversation that
we ever had. No fucking guns!

07:58.580 --> 08:00.751
You listen to me, Jaster.

08:01.460 --> 08:03.664
You send down that fucking lift!

08:03.892 --> 08:06.609
-Fuck you, you freak show!
-What are you doing?

08:08.405 --> 08:09.386
No!

08:09.683 --> 08:10.829
Wait.

08:11.028 --> 08:12.785
Wait!

08:45.940 --> 08:47.282
Crazy motherfucker!

08:52.309 --> 08:53.137
No!

08:54.517 --> 08:55.346
Stop!

08:58.965 --> 09:02.445
--frigid weather conditions
continue to pound the New York area.

10:02.357 --> 10:03.884
You fucking nuts?

10:06.613 --> 10:07.562
No.

10:22.294 --> 10:23.571
I'm fine.

10:25.397 --> 10:27.372
Thanks for your concern.

10:28.822 --> 10:31.539
-What the hell is wrong with him?
-Hold on.

10:31.734 --> 10:33.839
He's really disrespecting
my speed right now.

10:34.038 --> 10:36.972
He's about to bite me in the ass.
Disrespecting your speed?

10:37.174 --> 10:38.799
Where the hell they get a Doberman?

10:38.998 --> 10:41.201
Where's a nice, slow rottweiler
when you need him?

10:41.430 --> 10:44.245
You cased it for months
and didn't see a 200-pound dog?

10:44.438 --> 10:47.601
They was puppies when I saw them.
All right.

10:47.894 --> 10:49.782
On three, you go right, I'll go left.

10:50.006 --> 10:53.454
Fuck that. I go wrong all the time.
I'm going right.

10:53.654 --> 10:54.996
Okay, brother, whatever.

10:55.191 --> 10:56.946
One, two, three, break out.

10:57.494 --> 11:00.047
Gotta hurry.
Yeah, what you want now, huh?

11:00.247 --> 11:03.094
One-on-one.
It's me and you, baby. Me and you.

11:04.150 --> 11:08.208
Well, it can just be you.
It can just be you.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.912
How long does it take to
get these out of development?

11:14.487 --> 11:17.585
Because, you know, I been working
on my little portfolio.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.287
You're lucky I pulled my hamstring.

11:22.487 --> 11:24.526
Y'all would still be chasing me.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.662
You're saying that your partner
was a midget on a skateboard?

11:27.862 --> 11:31.922
Midgets is taking over. They took
over this playground where I live.

11:32.119 --> 11:34.453
They got this whole little
midget underworld.

11:36.567 --> 11:37.615
It's crazy.

11:37.815 --> 11:41.197
They squeezing us out because
they selling everything half-price.

11:41.399 --> 11:42.609
I'm innocent, yo.

11:42.839 --> 11:44.432
Oh, innocent, huh?

11:45.078 --> 11:47.796
Man, if you didn't have a gun,
I'd whup your ass.

11:48.279 --> 11:50.734
Where'd you get this then, huh?
A cocktail party?

12:17.207 --> 12:19.280
-What do you got?
-We got nothing.

12:19.864 --> 12:23.159
Both shot in the back of the head,
execution-style.

12:23.768 --> 12:27.565
Could be a 9 mil or a .38.
I couldn't find any empty shells.

12:28.439 --> 12:32.181
They died about three hours ago,
I would say.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.786
All right, listen up.

12:49.591 --> 12:51.663
My name is Edgar Clenteen.

12:52.119 --> 12:55.764
I'm the chief investigator, Special
Projects Unit, U.S. Treasury Dept.

12:56.088 --> 12:57.910
This is my crime scene.

12:58.103 --> 13:00.243
And you all are contaminating it.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.385
We got two young men here...

13:02.583 --> 13:05.267
...executed inside one of
the most secure rooms on earth.

13:05.464 --> 13:09.260
So whatever you find, I don't care
what it is, you bring it to me.

13:09.464 --> 13:12.497
I will not have anyone
fucking up this investigation.

13:14.424 --> 13:16.050
Now get out of here.

13:16.376 --> 13:18.514
Let Forensics do their work.

13:20.632 --> 13:22.487
Go on. Get out.

13:39.672 --> 13:41.046
I got one.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.412
We ran an AFIS match
on the fingerprint.

13:43.608 --> 13:48.245
John Delano Jaster, a heavy-equipment
operator with two prior felonies.

13:48.441 --> 13:51.375
-Where the hell do I find him?
-He's at Rikers.

13:52.889 --> 13:54.743
-Who's this?
-Well, who is this?

13:54.936 --> 13:58.734
John Jaster, asshole. You're in
my house. Put my wife on the phone.

13:58.969 --> 14:02.099
Oh, hey, Mr. Jaster.
Your wife stepped out.

14:02.297 --> 14:04.305
She told me to get the phone...

14:04.505 --> 14:06.676
...in case this was you
and, you know, it was.

14:06.873 --> 14:07.855
Who are you?

14:08.057 --> 14:12.367
I'm just here fixing the heat. Is
there a number she can reach you at...

14:12.568 --> 14:16.081
...or a message or something?
She has been worried sick about you.

14:16.281 --> 14:18.867
-You fix the heat, huh?
-Yeah, that's right.

14:19.065 --> 14:20.472
Let me tell you something.

14:20.664 --> 14:24.789
Lady said you'd never go for it, but
you'd save yourself a lot of grief...

14:25.017 --> 14:26.610
...you put in a new thermostat.

14:26.841 --> 14:30.671
Don't worry about my thermostat.
Tell my wife that I'm in Rikers.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.311
Oh, you don't say?

14:32.505 --> 14:36.302
Just tell her to get her ass
down here and get me out.

14:36.505 --> 14:39.735
Don't worry about it, pal.
I'll be sure to tell her.

14:41.017 --> 14:41.965
Jerk-off.

14:47.224 --> 14:49.330
Oh, that was your husband.

14:51.129 --> 14:53.617
He wants you to get him out of jail.

14:54.041 --> 14:56.594
But you've had a difficult day.

14:58.777 --> 15:00.338
Why don't I do it?

15:17.594 --> 15:18.771
Good morning, sir.

15:18.969 --> 15:21.304
I'd better not be wasting my time.

15:22.874 --> 15:24.248
Wooly, what do you got?

15:24.442 --> 15:27.060
Jaster's in a holding cell
with an Alvin Sanders.

15:27.258 --> 15:30.803
Some guy they picked up on a petty
theft heist for stealing shrimp.

15:31.033 --> 15:32.976
-Shrimp?
-Shrimp.

15:35.290 --> 15:39.894
That's pure nerve gas. You can use
that shit for weapons and shit.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.005
You burned the hairs out my nose.

15:42.202 --> 15:46.064
I see why they arrested you.
They gotta protect the public.

15:46.426 --> 15:50.517
I'm sorry. I suppose
you smell like daffodils.

15:51.258 --> 15:55.797
You should be mad at your ass.
You and your ass should get a divorce.

15:56.218 --> 15:59.088
-I don't feel good.
-Well, that makes two of us.

15:59.290 --> 16:03.000
Did you eat some shit on a half shell?
Yeah, grunt. Get it out.

16:03.194 --> 16:05.812
See, that's--
Yo, what's up? What's up, man?

16:06.234 --> 16:07.445
It's my heart.

16:07.642 --> 16:10.293
Yo, guard!
We need a doctor in here right now!

16:12.154 --> 16:14.456
-What's up?
-The pills. Get the pills.

16:15.898 --> 16:18.167
Hold on. I'm coming, I'm coming.

16:18.363 --> 16:21.177
All right. All right, just relax.
You all right?

16:21.370 --> 16:23.443
I'm gonna get somebody
for you, all right?

16:23.738 --> 16:25.200
-Alvin.
-Yeah.

16:27.770 --> 16:29.199
-Is that your name?
-Yeah.

16:29.403 --> 16:32.980
You probably know me. The shrimp
heist, but it was actually prawns.

16:36.346 --> 16:38.714
-If I don't make it--
-Oh, come on with that.

16:38.907 --> 16:42.038
Can you just listen?
This is important.

16:42.555 --> 16:45.337
I need you to get
a message to my wife.

16:46.842 --> 16:48.119
Tell her...

16:48.315 --> 16:50.704
...that she should go
to the Bronx Zoo.

16:52.026 --> 16:55.605
-Yeah. The Bronx Zoo. All right.
-Please.

16:55.803 --> 16:59.283
Tell her, ''There's no place
like home.''

17:00.027 --> 17:01.915
What about Toto...

17:02.299 --> 17:04.087
...and, you know,
the yellow brick road?

17:04.315 --> 17:06.038
What kind of pills you taking?

17:06.268 --> 17:07.380
Are you through.

17:09.275 --> 17:11.031
You get that message to her.

17:19.354 --> 17:20.848
I'll make it worth your while.

17:22.234 --> 17:25.496
Cool, cool.
Now, what if you do make it?

17:25.723 --> 17:28.984
You still break a brother off?
I need some change in my pocket.

17:36.380 --> 17:38.290
Damn, he already shit all over--

17:38.524 --> 17:40.433
Hands over your head and don't move.

17:42.043 --> 17:44.215
Drag this piece of crap upstairs.

17:48.092 --> 17:51.605
Dude was already sick. He was about
to die. What's wrong with you?

17:52.636 --> 17:54.229
Don't treat him like that.

17:54.428 --> 17:56.467
Don't treat him
like an animal like that.

17:57.051 --> 18:00.346
Y'all push him around. If it was me,
I wouldn't take that bullshit.

18:03.708 --> 18:04.657
Are you a doctor?

18:06.524 --> 18:08.149
We're ready here, sir.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.522
You been working out, huh?

18:10.715 --> 18:11.643
Sir?

18:14.012 --> 18:15.800
Yeah, you better talk to him, boy.

18:15.995 --> 18:19.607
You lucky these bars here.
You don't know who you fooling--

18:19.804 --> 18:20.884
Okay, you coming back.

18:21.084 --> 18:23.124
I'll be right up here
getting my sleep.

18:23.323 --> 18:24.568
I'll whup your ass.

18:24.764 --> 18:28.179
You don't know who you just
grabbed up on. I'm a gangster.

18:28.380 --> 18:29.460
I see you coming.

18:29.660 --> 18:31.864
Come here where there's no light,
I'll whup you.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.133
You got your boys
with your billy sticks.

18:34.333 --> 18:38.293
I'm Alvin, baby, king of the seafood.
They know me around these corridors.

18:46.909 --> 18:47.956
Explain it to me, John.

18:48.188 --> 18:52.410
How do you steal 40 million in gold
and not have the cash to make bail?

18:52.636 --> 18:54.840
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:58.492 --> 19:00.052
I'm out of aspirin.

19:00.541 --> 19:02.035
Could you get me some?

19:03.900 --> 19:05.013
Chewable.

19:09.660 --> 19:11.089
How'd it happen?

19:13.085 --> 19:14.940
How do you pull
the heist of the decade...

19:15.197 --> 19:17.815
...and get busted for a DWl?

19:24.636 --> 19:26.360
What kind of man...

19:26.557 --> 19:28.379
...goes out celebrating...

19:28.829 --> 19:31.447
...after he pops two boys
in the back of the head?

19:31.645 --> 19:33.238
Look, I didn't....

19:35.901 --> 19:37.788
You're not hanging that on me.

19:39.006 --> 19:40.729
They were on the floor...

19:41.949 --> 19:43.323
...facedown.

19:44.414 --> 19:48.025
It was an execution, pure and simple.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.522
No guns, man.

19:51.293 --> 19:55.187
Look, I'm a contractor.
I'm no fucking shooter!

19:55.421 --> 19:56.566
Then who?

19:58.589 --> 20:00.247
Just give me the names.

20:00.445 --> 20:02.070
A name. It was just....

20:02.525 --> 20:04.827
There was just one other guy.
It was me and him.

20:06.557 --> 20:09.492
-Bullshit. Bullshit!
-One guy. One guy!

20:09.693 --> 20:10.969
I swear it.

20:11.581 --> 20:13.971
Computer is what this guy's got.

20:15.326 --> 20:17.562
He's got the whole government wired.

20:23.933 --> 20:24.861
Who?

20:25.597 --> 20:27.736
Come on, Jaster, tell me who.

20:28.510 --> 20:31.576
Give me the goddamn name, Jaster.
Just give me a name.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.955
Please, listen to me.

20:36.414 --> 20:38.071
Get me a doctor.

20:41.150 --> 20:43.670
Get me a doctor. Please.

20:44.030 --> 20:46.486
-I'll give you a name.
-You're giving me a brain tumor.

20:46.686 --> 20:51.159
You give me a pass,
I'll give you the fucking gold!

20:53.341 --> 20:55.316
Nobody knows where it is
but me, you know.

21:02.046 --> 21:03.355
Did you burn your partner?

21:03.549 --> 21:05.143
I need a doctor.

21:05.470 --> 21:08.568
You took the gold
and left him there, didn't you?

21:09.918 --> 21:13.714
No wonder you drank. You figured
jail was the best place to lay low.

21:13.918 --> 21:15.292
Just keep pulling my chain...

21:15.486 --> 21:18.747
...keep on with
with this happy horseshit...

21:19.198 --> 21:21.588
...l'll make sure
you do need a doctor.

21:31.327 --> 21:33.629
-Ed?
-What, goddamn it?!

21:33.823 --> 21:35.764
I don't think he's faking.

22:39.871 --> 22:43.319
Damn, I was just trying
to have a good meal.

22:44.671 --> 22:45.981
Damn!

22:46.431 --> 22:48.536
And I just thought you had gas.

22:48.736 --> 22:50.143
Oh, shit.

22:50.815 --> 22:52.887
-What the hell?
-Get in there.

22:53.663 --> 22:54.678
Move it.

22:58.016 --> 23:00.830
You lucky. Oh, you lucky.

23:02.368 --> 23:03.742
Sit down, Alvin.

23:07.135 --> 23:08.216
Not there.

23:08.511 --> 23:11.162
Oh, yeah. Got reserved seats.

23:14.048 --> 23:15.674
Watching the game?

23:16.640 --> 23:18.134
Big screen.

23:20.064 --> 23:21.439
Hey, look, I apologize...

23:21.632 --> 23:24.088
...about that irreverent shit
I displayed in the cell.

23:24.287 --> 23:26.076
I was out of line.

23:26.272 --> 23:28.247
I had been lifting weights...

23:28.480 --> 23:31.960
...and I just got through doing curls,
so I was real tense.

23:32.256 --> 23:33.238
Hey, Alvin?

23:35.679 --> 23:37.109
I got some good news.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.734
And bad news.
Want to hear the good news?

23:40.928 --> 23:43.165
Yeah, I mean, good news is great.

23:44.192 --> 23:47.127
You're fucked.
Want to hear the bad news?

23:47.328 --> 23:49.696
I think you just told me the bad news.

23:49.888 --> 23:51.775
Unless you want to tell me
worser news.

23:51.968 --> 23:53.823
You're alone in a room with me.

23:58.305 --> 23:59.614
Yeah, right.

24:01.536 --> 24:03.063
So, what you want?

24:04.128 --> 24:05.754
You and....

24:07.584 --> 24:10.749
You and Jaster were alone
in that cell for eight hours.

24:11.424 --> 24:12.504
All alone.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.743
You must have talked about something.

24:15.553 --> 24:16.926
His bowels.

24:17.505 --> 24:20.604
He was shitting and coughing
and it didn't smell good.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.255
How do you talk to somebody like that?

24:24.417 --> 24:26.010
-It's terrible.
-Alvin.

24:28.065 --> 24:30.040
I do this for a living.

24:31.425 --> 24:34.294
You think I can't see that
you're hiding something?

24:38.848 --> 24:41.020
Okay, everybody out.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.892
Alvin, think about Jaster...

24:50.497 --> 24:52.865
...and tell me
where you want the bruises.

24:53.504 --> 24:56.156
You trying to try
some sneaky shit, huh?

24:56.418 --> 24:59.417
Gonna fool me with the quiet voice
while you beat on my body.

24:59.617 --> 25:02.235
You can do that,
but you can't beat on my soul.

25:02.434 --> 25:05.336
Do the words ''Stokely Carmichael''
mean anything to y'all?

25:05.569 --> 25:08.319
Reverend Malcolm X?
Reverend AI Sharpton?

25:08.514 --> 25:10.422
I see you taking off your Timex.

25:10.657 --> 25:13.658
I ain't telling you shit nor
the brothers behind the aquarium.

25:13.857 --> 25:15.712
You can kiss my ass
with your tongue...

25:15.905 --> 25:18.175
...and I will take
this information to my grave.

25:18.370 --> 25:21.665
The man said something
about the Bronx Zoo, okay?

25:47.554 --> 25:48.350
Well?

25:48.546 --> 25:50.847
We completed our search
of The World of Darkness.

25:51.041 --> 25:55.100
That would be your bats,
your leopard cats, your mole rats.

25:55.298 --> 25:56.923
We came up empty, sir.

25:58.530 --> 26:00.505
''There's no place like home.''

26:02.242 --> 26:04.763
-It's gotta be a building.
-We checked them all.

26:04.962 --> 26:08.028
We checked the monkey house,
the reptile house, the giraffe house.

26:08.258 --> 26:09.665
Even the outhouse.

26:09.858 --> 26:12.378
We scanned the entire grounds
to a depth of 20 feet.

26:12.610 --> 26:14.433
This guy was
a heavy-equipment operator.

26:14.626 --> 26:17.593
Five minutes with a machine,
he could've buried the gold anywhere.

26:17.794 --> 26:19.616
So where does that leave us, sir?

26:19.939 --> 26:21.630
Square-fucking-one.

26:24.002 --> 26:26.272
Come on, let's go
check the outhouse again.

26:26.466 --> 26:27.480
Let's go.

26:34.722 --> 26:38.584
We have a national security crisis.

26:38.787 --> 26:43.064
Citadel 4 is the same system we use
to safeguard our nuclear facilities.

26:43.266 --> 26:46.398
This guy took it apart like
he was hot-wiring a Toyota.

26:46.978 --> 26:48.865
I'll give you the short version.

26:49.922 --> 26:52.127
We're talking world-class loner.

26:52.451 --> 26:56.411
A guy who spent literally tens
of thousands of hours at a computer...

26:56.611 --> 26:59.360
...feeling around in the dark.
Nothing but math.

26:59.555 --> 27:01.049
Nothing but numbers.

27:02.082 --> 27:06.785
His sense of well-being, his very
sanity is predicated on completion.

27:07.171 --> 27:09.789
Only this time,
the equation is incomplete.

27:10.147 --> 27:14.076
He didn't get the 42 million in gold
he'd worked so very hard for.

27:14.626 --> 27:16.153
That's our edge.

27:20.643 --> 27:21.985
Now this....

27:25.538 --> 27:27.841
This is what I need your money for.

27:30.627 --> 27:32.416
It's a BC-19.

27:32.931 --> 27:35.070
It's an experimental tracking device.

27:35.267 --> 27:37.536
Dr. Harris here can fill you in.

27:37.795 --> 27:40.730
Well, it's quite simple, really.

27:41.379 --> 27:43.801
The BC-19 has a proprietary signal...

27:44.004 --> 27:46.425
...broadcast and location.

27:46.659 --> 27:50.107
It's got a 10-mile radius and
full satellite coordinate tracking.

27:50.339 --> 27:52.575
Now, the optimum placement site...

27:52.771 --> 27:56.066
...is the temporal mandibular joint.

27:56.259 --> 27:58.169
It's just below the jaw.

27:58.564 --> 27:59.742
All right, look...

27:59.939 --> 28:03.616
...we implant this in
the appropriate subject, put him...

28:04.356 --> 28:07.257
...on the street, make it known
he knows where the gold is...

28:07.460 --> 28:10.657
...and I guarantee that our elusive
computer whiz will show up.

28:10.851 --> 28:14.910
Who would be willing to have
that thing implanted in their jaw?

28:15.428 --> 28:16.508
Senator...

28:17.251 --> 28:19.161
...we already have a volunteer.

28:22.820 --> 28:25.275
This is Howard Cosell.

28:25.476 --> 28:26.970
Down goes Frazier!

28:37.861 --> 28:38.940
Come on.

28:40.868 --> 28:42.591
Tenderize that bitch, Alvin.

28:42.788 --> 28:45.154
-What you got?
-I got all kinds of shit.

28:45.348 --> 28:46.755
Chest, chest, chest, nuts!

28:47.269 --> 28:49.341
What do you know about boxing?

28:49.572 --> 28:51.394
I ain't gotta box.
I get my skills from TV.

28:51.652 --> 28:54.019
I got Mike Tyson skills.
You biting me!

28:56.388 --> 28:58.592
My ears, my ears!

28:59.332 --> 29:01.340
I'll go Muhammad Ali on them.

29:01.925 --> 29:03.419
-That's cold.
-That ain't right.

29:03.621 --> 29:04.896
That ain't right.

29:05.092 --> 29:08.442
Once I get out of here, I'll get
my big score. I'll be set for life.

29:08.645 --> 29:10.270
I'll get me a 1 -year-old Arabian.

29:10.469 --> 29:12.378
A 1 -year-old?
What sick shit is that?

29:12.581 --> 29:16.258
I'm talking horses. Thoroughbreds.
They got royalty in their blood.

29:16.548 --> 29:19.069
-What you know about horses?
-I know everything.

29:19.269 --> 29:21.537
My father took me to the horse track.

29:21.764 --> 29:23.172
Taught me everything
about thoroughbreds.

29:23.397 --> 29:26.495
I'm teaching you awareness here.
See, I'm always aware.

29:26.692 --> 29:30.467
Stay aware of everything.
Are you watching? Watch my skills.

29:30.692 --> 29:33.824
I'm always aware. See my eyes?
I'm on a swivel.

29:34.149 --> 29:37.116
Can't nobody sneak up on you
and just get with you. That's--

30:05.093 --> 30:09.283
Mr. Clenteen, exactly how many laws
are we breaking here?

30:10.950 --> 30:12.411
You don't want to know.

30:20.838 --> 30:22.877
Ladies and gentlemen.

30:24.357 --> 30:26.845
You've all distinguished yourselves.

30:27.238 --> 30:29.692
You're all the best at what you do.

30:31.525 --> 30:32.954
Encryption.

30:33.189 --> 30:34.116
Hardware.

30:36.165 --> 30:37.594
Signal analysis.

30:37.798 --> 30:39.772
And as of this moment...

30:40.294 --> 30:43.872
...nothing else in your lives exists.

30:44.229 --> 30:47.099
You no longer exist.

30:50.181 --> 30:51.589
Welcome aboard.

30:52.230 --> 30:53.824
Don't disappoint me.

30:54.469 --> 30:55.680
Sir, I'm in.

30:55.877 --> 30:58.179
All right, here we go.

30:59.621 --> 31:03.364
Case number 141 1 263.

31:03.558 --> 31:06.754
Subject: Alvin Dean Sanders.

31:07.046 --> 31:10.177
Former cellmate: John Delano Jaster.

31:10.437 --> 31:12.893
Released from Sing Sing prison Friday.

31:13.574 --> 31:16.803
Treasury surveillance
subcontract required.

31:17.318 --> 31:19.555
Pay-grade status approved.

31:19.782 --> 31:22.782
Split-shift overtime coverage.

31:23.047 --> 31:27.269
Contact Special Agent Vicks
at tspec.com.

31:27.462 --> 31:30.942
Ed, you actually think this guy is
surfing Treasury Department files?

31:31.174 --> 31:34.241
What if he can't decode this?
We can make a less secure encryption.

31:34.438 --> 31:37.821
Maybe we should indicate we think
Sanders knows where the gold is.

31:39.046 --> 31:42.941
Listen to me. I had a grandfather
who was a trapper by profession.

31:45.190 --> 31:48.157
Now he had two prices
on his card: wolf...

31:48.359 --> 31:50.301
...and everything else.

31:51.239 --> 31:52.765
Now a wolf. ..

31:53.542 --> 31:55.845
... will starve itself to death...

31:56.039 --> 31:58.013
...rather than make a mistake.

31:58.823 --> 32:03.558
You have to lay down a scent
that smells real from far away.

32:04.231 --> 32:05.638
And the bait. ..

32:05.927 --> 32:10.018
...has to be fresh
and untouched by human hands.

32:10.567 --> 32:13.054
And make no mistake about it. ..

32:13.927 --> 32:16.546
... we are hunting wolf.

32:20.231 --> 32:21.758
Send the message.

32:32.903 --> 32:35.041
Voice recognition, please.

32:38.407 --> 32:40.262
Voice recognition, please.

32:40.455 --> 32:41.885
Bristol here.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.374
-All is well and good.
-Good morning, sir.

32:45.575 --> 32:47.102
Mainframe up, please.

32:47.303 --> 32:49.791
Mainframe boot sequence complete.

32:50.920 --> 32:52.742
System check, please.

32:52.936 --> 32:55.237
All systems are online.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.134
Let's see....

33:00.263 --> 33:01.212
Overnights, please.

33:01.416 --> 33:03.750
Overnights loading from NSA...

33:03.944 --> 33:07.108
...and Treasury Department
servers U. S. dot gov.

33:07.336 --> 33:10.597
Overnights loaded, ready for review.

33:11.687 --> 33:14.502
Where shall we start today?

33:21.480 --> 33:23.236
NSA, please.

33:23.432 --> 33:26.563
NSA loaded.

33:28.967 --> 33:30.723
A secret, huh?

33:32.263 --> 33:34.052
I love a secret.

33:38.376 --> 33:39.270
Alvin...

33:39.688 --> 33:42.306
...do you feel like a lucky man?

33:43.784 --> 33:46.783
No. Yes.
Well, it depends on what you....

33:47.336 --> 33:50.500
Of all the many crimes
that men commit...

33:51.016 --> 33:54.726
...the worst punishment
is rewarded those...

33:54.952 --> 33:57.123
...who squander their good fortune.

33:57.319 --> 33:59.971
-You're right, you're right.
-You understand me?

34:00.168 --> 34:01.248
No, sir.

34:01.641 --> 34:02.655
Mr. Sanders...

34:03.048 --> 34:05.317
...you were arrested and booked...

34:05.512 --> 34:07.846
...by a police officer
named Wayne Miller for...

34:08.424 --> 34:09.472
...theft of shrimp.

34:09.704 --> 34:12.225
Well, you know,
actually they were prawns.

34:12.456 --> 34:16.199
You know the big jumbo shrimp
that's, like, at least a dollar--

34:16.393 --> 34:18.945
Six weeks ago,
in an internal investigation...

34:19.143 --> 34:22.178
...Miller admitted to a dozen counts
of falsifying evidence.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.643
Son of a...

34:24.841 --> 34:26.303
...Jesus.

34:26.728 --> 34:29.663
Thank God for people
that come forward.

34:29.864 --> 34:33.661
Needless to say, we've been petitioned
to repudiate the convictions.

34:34.056 --> 34:35.431
Repudiation is what--

34:35.623 --> 34:38.275
What everybody needs more of
is a little repudiation.

34:38.473 --> 34:41.058
Now, repudiation is....
Use it in a sentence.

34:42.536 --> 34:45.089
I have a short sentence
for you, Alvin.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.295
You walk.

35:02.537 --> 35:04.064
I'm back, baby!

35:04.265 --> 35:05.508
You miss me?

35:05.897 --> 35:07.271
I'm free!

35:07.881 --> 35:11.264
New York City, do you feel me?

35:23.529 --> 35:26.660
Okay, let's take it for a spin.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.473
Time code is locked.
Satellite uplink is sealed.

35:30.826 --> 35:32.418
Tracking is a go.

35:36.489 --> 35:37.602
Hey, yo, taxi!

35:37.993 --> 35:39.685
Yeah, where you going there?

35:39.882 --> 35:41.289
I'm trying to get to Queens.

35:41.929 --> 35:44.712
Jeez, that's bad for me.

35:44.937 --> 35:46.148
I don't go to Queens.

35:46.346 --> 35:47.328
What do you mean?

35:53.449 --> 35:55.654
I seldom get there.
Where is it?

35:55.849 --> 35:58.304
Copy that.
All right, guys, we're up.

36:00.234 --> 36:03.332
Checking sound levels.
Levels are stable, sir.

36:03.529 --> 36:05.122
Good. We have a visual?

36:05.322 --> 36:07.842
Air Unit, this is Mobile 1 .
Confirming.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.635
We have a visual. Do you copy?

36:10.282 --> 36:12.388
Roger that. The bird has ears.

36:29.226 --> 36:30.022
Who is it?

36:30.218 --> 36:33.066
I hear you didn't pay your bill.
I'm here for your bills.

36:33.258 --> 36:35.113
-My mom ain't here.
-Just like you people.

36:35.306 --> 36:37.129
-Get your ass away from my door.
-Come out.

36:38.154 --> 36:38.950
What's up?

36:39.626 --> 36:42.922
-What's going down?
-What's happening, baby?

36:43.115 --> 36:45.121
-You escape?
-As a matter of fact....

36:45.515 --> 36:49.824
Quit playing so much. You know
I got warrants and stuff around here.

36:50.058 --> 36:52.361
-They don't just let people go.
-They let me go.

36:52.554 --> 36:54.442
Well, that sound like some bullcrap.

36:54.666 --> 36:56.805
It wasn't. They can't hold me.

36:57.002 --> 36:59.141
I'm the man.
Alvin, king of the seafood.

36:59.371 --> 37:01.225
Oh, my God, Steven.

37:02.250 --> 37:06.658
Oh, my God.
My stomach hurts and I'm crying.

37:06.987 --> 37:08.743
What's wrong? Happy to be out?

37:08.939 --> 37:12.681
You a full-fledged criminal. Look.
It's like The Price is Right.

37:12.875 --> 37:14.882
That's right. That's right.

37:15.083 --> 37:16.489
Mom's still here, right?

37:16.683 --> 37:17.763
We live here now.

37:20.171 --> 37:21.316
Tell him, Stevie.

37:24.203 --> 37:25.480
''Tell me, Stevie.''

37:29.131 --> 37:30.341
What is that?

37:30.571 --> 37:31.585
That's a Tika.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.953
We about to get married
when she gets that blood test.

37:35.147 --> 37:36.673
That's a bullshit test.

37:37.322 --> 37:38.752
You're just fucking with me.

37:39.275 --> 37:40.705
Yeah.

37:41.292 --> 37:44.739
-Make sure she gets all her shots.
-I'm gonna do that.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.084
Where'd you get all this?

37:46.315 --> 37:49.381
Julio and Ramundo cut me in
on a sweet Godfather deal.

37:49.580 --> 37:51.784
See, you cut Julio and Ramundo out.

37:52.011 --> 37:54.498
It's just me and you.
We back on the block.

37:54.859 --> 37:56.834
This guy's a real beauty.

37:57.611 --> 37:59.172
Are you surprised?

38:00.267 --> 38:01.697
I think I'll go...

38:02.731 --> 38:04.225
...see my girl, Lisa.

38:04.651 --> 38:06.309
-Who?
-Lisa.

38:06.508 --> 38:07.752
That won't be pretty.

38:07.947 --> 38:10.981
What you mean?
She ain't been seeing nobody, has she?

38:11.179 --> 38:13.448
It ain't like I'm tripping
on the whole thing.

38:13.643 --> 38:16.513
I mean, not that I give a damn.

38:16.716 --> 38:19.749
They'll do what they do
and I'll do what I do.

38:19.948 --> 38:22.948
Right, that's how you are.
You ain't never been like--

38:23.595 --> 38:25.505
I'm gonna shower and run over.

38:27.628 --> 38:29.832
-Good seeing you, bro.
-Good seeing you.

38:30.027 --> 38:32.395
-She probably--
-You went crazy since....

38:32.588 --> 38:35.653
I'll put my work in, though.
You my money.

38:36.556 --> 38:37.800
Who's Lisa?

38:37.996 --> 38:39.043
That's the girlfriend.

38:39.404 --> 38:41.062
They were living together.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.849
Lisa Hill, 27...

38:43.052 --> 38:46.117
...assistant manager ofBook Stew,
a used bookstore in Soho.

38:46.316 --> 38:48.869
She also waits tables
at the Sunrise Lounge.

38:50.540 --> 38:53.574
There better not be nobody
in there either. I'm serious.

38:53.772 --> 38:57.088
If there is, and if he ain't big,
I'll put the boots to him.

38:57.324 --> 38:58.469
Put the boots on him.

39:00.331 --> 39:01.160
Hang on.

39:03.052 --> 39:04.459
You're early.

39:04.653 --> 39:06.375
You damn right I am.

39:10.956 --> 39:12.866
Oh, my God. Alvin?

39:13.101 --> 39:16.067
What up?
You going on a date behind my back?

39:16.364 --> 39:17.509
Fuck you, Alvin.

39:17.708 --> 39:21.004
That's music to my ears.
Where do you want it? The couch?

39:21.196 --> 39:24.938
You disappear for two years, then have
the nerve to ask about my life?

39:25.132 --> 39:26.277
Fuck you, Alvin.

39:26.476 --> 39:29.706
You mean, like really ''fuck you''
fuck you? Like ''motherfuck you''?

39:30.701 --> 39:33.034
Bad move, Alvin.
Can't be too jealous.

39:33.261 --> 39:35.432
-Turn around and walk out.
-I got you flowers.

39:35.629 --> 39:37.571
Oh, thank you. Now you can leave.

39:37.805 --> 39:41.034
You need to pump your brakes
and recognize that your man is home.

39:41.229 --> 39:43.530
So, what happened, Alvin?
You escaped?

39:43.725 --> 39:46.475
Yeah, we had to tunnel out.
It was terrible.

39:46.669 --> 39:49.832
They released the dogs. They caught
up with me and my whole crew.

39:50.317 --> 39:53.382
Harriet Tubman, Kunte Kinte.
Harriet don't move like she used to.

39:53.580 --> 39:55.435
The dogs was chewing all on her ass.

39:55.629 --> 39:59.939
You know what, I don't have time
for this random gibberish.

40:00.557 --> 40:02.696
There was a dirty cop
so they let me go.

40:03.277 --> 40:05.066
Congratulations. Now leave.

40:05.261 --> 40:06.570
You don't mean that.

40:07.021 --> 40:10.152
How come you didn't come see me?
You didn't write me or nothing.

40:10.349 --> 40:14.059
I was going to come see you.
I was gonna write you and tell--

40:14.669 --> 40:15.814
You wouldn't understand.

40:16.013 --> 40:19.591
I wouldn't understand? I don't
understand why we ain't celebrating.

40:19.789 --> 40:21.316
I'm out. I'm back home.

40:21.518 --> 40:23.884
Home? No, see, this is my house.

40:24.077 --> 40:27.143
I pay the bills, I pay the rent.
You pay...?

40:27.886 --> 40:29.347
Exactly. Excuse me.

40:29.549 --> 40:32.812
You're upset. Stevie was the one
behind the whole thing.

40:33.038 --> 40:34.630
I was on my way to church.

40:34.860 --> 40:37.032
The next thing I know, I'm stealing.

40:37.230 --> 40:41.190
Stevie? I don't remember hearing
anything about Stevie going to jail.

40:42.126 --> 40:45.224
Lisa, look at me. Do I look
like I've been in day camp?

40:45.709 --> 40:48.044
I been around hard-core criminals.

40:48.238 --> 40:50.376
I'd like something soft
up against my body.

40:50.573 --> 40:53.508
I'd like to have a home-cooked meal,
a hug from my woman.

40:53.709 --> 40:55.117
What about a table dance?

40:56.141 --> 40:57.996
-Prison has changed me.
-Oh, really?

40:58.190 --> 41:02.019
Yes, it has. And I'm ready
for responsibility. What is that?

41:03.182 --> 41:04.840
What do you think it is?

41:05.454 --> 41:06.631
A puppy, I hope.

41:07.405 --> 41:08.715
It's not a puppy.

41:09.710 --> 41:11.597
What you been doing since I been gone?

41:15.566 --> 41:16.995
What's going on?

41:17.198 --> 41:18.278
Sweetie.

41:23.054 --> 41:24.909
This is your son, Alvin.

41:25.262 --> 41:26.887
That ain't my son.

41:27.086 --> 41:28.330
You think I made it up?

41:28.526 --> 41:29.671
I don't know.

41:31.821 --> 41:32.836
I mean, how?

41:33.038 --> 41:37.064
How? That night,
after Stevie's birthday party.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.737
Yeah, we did and...

41:41.935 --> 41:43.046
...wow.

41:45.966 --> 41:50.025
He don't really look like me.
He kind of chubby, ain't got no teeth.

41:50.606 --> 41:52.101
IKind of cute.

41:54.222 --> 41:55.913
Can I hold him?

41:57.615 --> 42:00.070
Don't be like that.
Can I hold my son?

42:01.166 --> 42:03.109
He calling for his daddy anyway.

42:03.822 --> 42:05.164
Please?

42:16.111 --> 42:19.111
I cannot believe this. Look at this!

42:19.343 --> 42:21.066
Doesn't it trip you out?

42:21.647 --> 42:24.101
Me and you, and the next thing
you know, we got this.

42:24.302 --> 42:27.270
It's like half and half,
I guess, you know.

42:27.631 --> 42:30.413
-He'll be a little player.
-He won't be a player.

42:31.599 --> 42:35.308
He's strong. Look at that grip.
Big old fella.

42:37.071 --> 42:40.071
I think he sprung a leak.
He kind of smells.

42:40.751 --> 42:42.661
Never mind, Alvin.

42:43.151 --> 42:46.860
I'm going to work. The babysitter
will be here in five minutes.

42:54.096 --> 42:55.405
Come on, Lisa.

42:55.599 --> 42:59.309
Just give me another chance.
I'll get out there, I'll get a job.

42:59.504 --> 43:02.405
Take care of myself.
I'll take care of you.

43:02.607 --> 43:06.917
We got a whole little family.
Don't squeeze me out of that.

43:08.048 --> 43:10.088
You know, Alvin,
it's been really hard.

43:10.287 --> 43:12.970
I know. It's hard for everybody.

43:19.695 --> 43:23.044
Okay, but you gotta prove yourself.

43:23.247 --> 43:24.589
-You gotta get a job.
-I'll get that.

43:24.783 --> 43:27.532
-Stay out of jail.
-I don't remember how to get to jail.

43:27.919 --> 43:29.675
And stop dressing like a thug.

43:29.872 --> 43:31.563
I'll get a new Versace, Gucci.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.035
Maybe I'll consider--

43:33.231 --> 43:35.850
-Making love to your man?
-Having dinner with you.

43:36.048 --> 43:40.271
You'll like the way I cook.
While I was in there, taught me how.

43:40.464 --> 43:42.024
I can cook you anything.

43:42.224 --> 43:46.185
French. Bon giorno.
I can cook ltalian. Ciao, bella.

43:46.416 --> 43:48.171
Or I can cook, like, soul food.

43:48.368 --> 43:50.986
''Daisy, check your greens.
They done spoiled now.''

43:51.184 --> 43:53.038
-Goodbye, Alvin.
-Can I get a kiss?

43:54.512 --> 43:57.676
-Goodbye, Alvin.
-All right. Take it easy.

43:59.343 --> 44:02.093
-Lisa?
-Yes?

44:02.480 --> 44:04.389
What's my son's name?

44:05.040 --> 44:07.910
-His name is Gregory.
-Gregory.

44:08.625 --> 44:10.031
Gregory.

44:11.665 --> 44:13.672
G-Dog! That's all right.

44:16.817 --> 44:18.311
That's your daddy.

44:21.680 --> 44:24.647
I think old Alvin just
might make it this time.

44:27.569 --> 44:29.543
Alvin Sanders is bait.

44:30.864 --> 44:32.425
That's all he is.

44:34.385 --> 44:35.945
When he's served his purpose...

44:36.144 --> 44:38.795
...when he draws our man
out of the shadows....

44:41.296 --> 44:43.336
Well, you know what happens to bait.

44:49.169 --> 44:51.143
Well, well, well.

44:52.529 --> 44:55.692
Decoding complete.

45:03.953 --> 45:06.125
Sequence complete.

45:13.009 --> 45:14.253
Look at this shit.

45:14.545 --> 45:15.560
Clown.

45:15.761 --> 45:17.451
Sushi chef.

45:18.257 --> 45:19.916
Male exotic dancer.

45:20.530 --> 45:22.351
That might be all right.

45:25.586 --> 45:26.895
What's cracking?

45:27.345 --> 45:30.193
Yes, I'm looking
for a Mr. Alvin Sanders.

45:31.057 --> 45:33.926
I do not know if
a Mr. Sanders is around.

45:34.130 --> 45:35.307
Who is calling?

45:35.505 --> 45:39.214
My name is Rhonda Glimsher.
I'm a student at Columbia University.

45:39.601 --> 45:41.674
-I'm working on my master's degree.
-Trace it.

45:41.873 --> 45:45.037
-Excuse me? You said ''Master P''?
-Master's degree.

45:45.234 --> 45:46.281
Toronto.

45:46.769 --> 45:48.394
No, wait. Dublin.

45:48.593 --> 45:50.317
No, I got it. Madrid!

45:50.609 --> 45:52.333
This is Mobile 1 . We're on it.

45:53.809 --> 45:54.737
Orlando?

45:54.961 --> 45:56.336
I was given Mr. Sander's name...

45:56.529 --> 45:58.569
...from the Department
of Corrections.

45:58.801 --> 46:01.518
Sons of bitches. Anyway, go on.

46:01.714 --> 46:03.373
Going through a call diverter!

46:04.850 --> 46:06.443
-Nothing.
-Give me 63 again.

46:06.642 --> 46:07.820
Got the location.

46:08.977 --> 46:11.433
Air unit, Mobile 1
requesting visual support.

46:12.370 --> 46:15.665
I'm doing an aftercare survey
as part of my thesis...

46:15.858 --> 46:19.175
...and I'm paying 200 dollars
per interview.

46:19.377 --> 46:20.807
What? 200 dollars?

46:22.098 --> 46:23.276
It's a skipped signal.

46:23.474 --> 46:24.651
Not isolating frequency.

46:25.010 --> 46:27.694
-Try a back-end patch.
-What do you think I'm doing?

46:27.890 --> 46:29.647
Are you Mr. Sanders?

46:29.842 --> 46:32.941
I am not him, but I am Mr. Sanders'...

46:33.138 --> 46:34.066
...agent.

46:34.290 --> 46:36.199
Give me 63 again. Where are you?

46:36.402 --> 46:37.646
Tel Aviv. Where is he?!

46:37.842 --> 46:41.737
I must be sure you're not lying.
Mr. Sanders doesn't like that.

46:41.937 --> 46:44.043
Mr. Sanders could get upset. ..

46:44.242 --> 46:46.893
...and pop cap in ass.
You ever been capped and popped?

46:47.090 --> 46:49.295
-Going to original patch.
-Showing 13 countries!

46:49.522 --> 46:51.114
-It was 71 .
-It was 74!

46:51.314 --> 46:53.486
Stay on the line.
IKeep him on the line.

46:53.682 --> 46:56.584
-What do you got?
-It must be another call box.

46:58.290 --> 47:00.746
I'll call back in a few days
for an appointment.

47:00.979 --> 47:04.240
Make sure you do because
I really need to get that cash.

47:05.011 --> 47:06.865
Thank you for your time.

47:08.626 --> 47:10.536
We got nothing here!

47:11.315 --> 47:12.263
He's gone.

47:22.322 --> 47:24.210
I've never seen anything like this.

47:25.971 --> 47:27.215
It was him.

47:28.819 --> 47:30.226
He crawled out from the dark...

47:30.419 --> 47:32.274
...and he fucking bit.

47:50.803 --> 47:52.211
Boss, boss, boss.

47:52.403 --> 47:53.963
What's happening, my man?

47:54.163 --> 47:56.530
-May I help you?
-Yeah, I'm looking for a job.

47:56.723 --> 47:58.861
I'd like to start
in entrepreneurial...

47:59.059 --> 48:01.961
...but if not, I'll work my way up
from the washroom.

48:02.195 --> 48:03.657
Wait tables or whatever.

48:03.892 --> 48:05.746
I had a couple problems, okay?

48:05.939 --> 48:08.209
But everything is cool now.

48:11.091 --> 48:13.361
Didn't you rob me a few years ago?

48:15.091 --> 48:16.618
You walked in with a skinny guy...

48:16.820 --> 48:20.016
...picked up my cash register
and ran out the door with it.

48:22.932 --> 48:25.833
No, that wasn't me.
I don't hang out with thin dudes.

48:26.035 --> 48:28.686
Your friend got away.
I picked you out of the lineup.

48:29.236 --> 48:31.210
Number four. You were number four!

48:31.539 --> 48:34.060
I was number four in high school
when I played ball.

48:34.292 --> 48:36.812
Cute. Now you're here
asking me for a job?

48:37.043 --> 48:39.313
You holding me up again?
I'm calling the police.

48:40.373 --> 48:42.379
-911 . I need the cops.
-You tripping.

48:42.580 --> 48:44.555
This is just a resume.
Everybody...

48:44.756 --> 48:46.282
...you see, this is a resume.

48:49.236 --> 48:50.610
This isn't happening.

48:50.836 --> 48:51.948
This is a resume.

48:52.147 --> 48:54.798
Please, I'm putting the resume down
right now.

48:54.996 --> 48:56.850
Okay? IKeep eating, please.

48:57.044 --> 48:59.019
Ricky Martin, don't make me do this.

48:59.219 --> 49:00.976
I ain't here for this.
Hands--

49:01.172 --> 49:02.120
WWF!

49:03.380 --> 49:04.624
I called the cops.

49:04.852 --> 49:07.307
Damn! Getting a job
is getting dangerous.

49:08.052 --> 49:09.808
Stop that guy!

49:11.093 --> 49:13.002
-Ijust wanted ajob.
-Oh, fuck.

49:14.036 --> 49:15.530
Maybe you picked the wrong guy.

49:17.940 --> 49:19.052
Or not.

49:37.749 --> 49:40.880
Give me another chance.
I'll get out there. I'll get ajob.

49:43.348 --> 49:45.715
Take care ofmyself,
I'll take care of you.

49:46.420 --> 49:48.014
We got a whole little family.

49:48.852 --> 49:50.674
Don't squeeze me out of that.

49:52.917 --> 49:54.859
What's my son's name?

49:58.964 --> 50:00.306
Gregory.

50:06.068 --> 50:07.116
Alvin, get in.

50:07.861 --> 50:08.810
Stevie...

50:09.046 --> 50:10.419
...is this stolen?

50:10.741 --> 50:14.516
No, Julio and Ramundo hooked me up
with this. I'm tight with them.

50:14.741 --> 50:17.458
No, you ain't. This is stolen.
I ain't getting in.

50:17.653 --> 50:19.726
Julio and Ramundo...

50:19.924 --> 50:22.259
...hooked me up with this.
I'm tight with them.

50:22.645 --> 50:23.692
It is not stolen.

50:24.021 --> 50:26.060
Alvin, get in.

50:26.261 --> 50:27.210
It's stolen.

50:27.541 --> 50:30.127
It is not stolen.
Man, it is cold outside.

50:30.325 --> 50:31.983
It's flu season. Get in.

50:32.181 --> 50:35.281
You know me. I'll go through
some cold. I ain't....

50:35.477 --> 50:37.200
I ain't standing here much longer.

50:37.589 --> 50:39.445
Why you got to be my brother?

50:40.502 --> 50:41.777
We're fine. Look, baby--

50:42.005 --> 50:43.499
I know you'll get me in trouble.

50:43.733 --> 50:46.154
I'm gonna rock this box
in your ear.

50:46.453 --> 50:48.242
I don't feel like listening--

50:48.469 --> 50:49.778
Who that?

51:21.174 --> 51:24.173
We're on the 59th Street Bridge,
headed into the city.

51:28.214 --> 51:29.588
This ain't the way home.

51:29.782 --> 51:32.171
We got some business to take care of.

51:33.301 --> 51:35.025
Steven, I told you, man--

51:35.222 --> 51:36.651
Just sit back and relax.

51:36.854 --> 51:40.302
You riding with something like a pimp.
I'm something like a pimp.

51:41.462 --> 51:43.763
I'm supposed to be a pimp
on the thirteenth.

51:45.590 --> 51:48.209
I'm something like a pimp.
I'm something like it.

51:58.806 --> 52:01.621
He just made a left off 2nd.
Moving east on Canal.

52:02.806 --> 52:04.301
He's going to the docks.

52:04.501 --> 52:08.364
According to this file on Steve,
that's where he makes his pickups.

52:22.583 --> 52:24.241
This way, gentlemen.

52:32.758 --> 52:35.214
I pulled a bust sheet from NYPD
and guess what?

52:35.415 --> 52:38.612
They got an undercover special
going down tonight at Pier 27.

52:38.807 --> 52:42.102
Christ! That stupid son of a bitch
is about to get pinched.

52:42.391 --> 52:44.049
Mobile 3, move in.

52:46.199 --> 52:48.021
Pull over. I'm not doing this.

52:48.247 --> 52:49.774
-Nope.
-I'm going straight.

52:50.007 --> 52:51.152
Pull the car over.

52:51.384 --> 52:54.580
Alvin, you're ex-con.
You just got out of the penitentiary.

52:54.776 --> 52:57.972
You got 26 dollars in your pocket,
25 of it is mine.

52:58.166 --> 52:59.574
-Pull over.
-I'm not pulling--

52:59.767 --> 53:03.629
-Get your finger out my face.
-Get your finger out my face.

53:03.831 --> 53:05.041
-Don't touch me.
-Don't touch me.

53:05.239 --> 53:07.343
-Don't touch me.
-Don't touch me.

53:07.543 --> 53:09.070
I didn 't touch you!

53:10.647 --> 53:12.305
-Don't touch me.
-I ain't.

53:12.503 --> 53:14.959
-You touched me.
-I didn't touch you!

53:15.159 --> 53:16.141
I got business.

53:16.344 --> 53:18.132
-Hello?
-Give me this phone.

53:18.359 --> 53:20.629
-Yo, Stevie.
-Yeah, Julio? Ramundo?

53:20.855 --> 53:23.604
He can't come to the phone.
He banging your girlfriend.

53:23.799 --> 53:25.971
-Give me the phone.
-''Ah, it's so good!''

53:26.263 --> 53:28.684
''lt's not fair
that you do your thing!''

53:28.919 --> 53:29.847
Give me the phone.

53:32.312 --> 53:33.806
It was that fuck, Alvin.

53:34.007 --> 53:36.374
Alvin?
That kid ain't nothing but trouble.

53:36.567 --> 53:38.160
Stop playing, man!

53:38.520 --> 53:40.374
I make 10 G's off them a week.

53:41.144 --> 53:42.606
-Ten G's?
-Yeah.

53:42.808 --> 53:45.491
Plus they sell food stamps.
I bought 160 for...

53:45.688 --> 53:47.630
...it was 84, something like that.

53:48.344 --> 53:49.805
-Ten G's?
-That's right.

53:55.319 --> 53:57.142
Turn left on East Broadway...

53:57.335 --> 53:58.797
...half a mile before they turn.

54:05.367 --> 54:08.085
Mobile 3. Do not
let him enter the docks.

54:08.280 --> 54:11.127
-Do not let him make that turn.
-Copy that.

54:24.761 --> 54:26.768
What the hell?!
What's going on?

54:31.416 --> 54:34.166
-What the hell's your problem, man?
-Oh, shit!

54:36.568 --> 54:38.576
Did you jump out a cab and not pay?

54:42.328 --> 54:43.637
Quit talking and drive.

54:45.496 --> 54:47.089
This ain't no Cadillac!

54:47.288 --> 54:50.966
You can't run into me! This
ain 't no Buick! Do I know you?

54:53.528 --> 54:56.562
-This dude's losing his mind.
-Pull over now! Right now!

54:56.793 --> 54:58.353
-He got a gun.
-To shoot you.

54:58.584 --> 55:00.886
-Don't you have a gun?
-Not with me.

55:01.081 --> 55:02.935
Pull the fucking car over!

55:03.128 --> 55:05.136
Use your finger. Get away!

55:08.248 --> 55:09.493
-Ain't working.
-I know.

55:12.185 --> 55:13.461
Trip around him!

55:13.657 --> 55:15.315
Handle your business, boy!

55:19.640 --> 55:20.568
Watch out!

55:30.009 --> 55:31.438
Take a right here.

55:48.761 --> 55:50.005
Damn! Shit.

55:56.922 --> 55:58.897
Damn, Stevie.
What the hell was that?

56:00.793 --> 56:02.703
Shit, man. We late.

56:03.449 --> 56:06.296
Come on, man. We can walk
to the docks from here.

56:06.522 --> 56:08.115
Come on. You with me?

56:09.594 --> 56:10.902
Come on.

56:16.570 --> 56:17.912
You with me?

56:22.457 --> 56:23.406
Come on.

56:23.609 --> 56:25.432
Can't be a fuck-up all your life.

56:25.626 --> 56:27.764
-He's moving.
-Direction?

56:30.010 --> 56:32.727
North on Jackson Street.

56:34.010 --> 56:35.898
Away from the docks.

56:46.491 --> 56:48.246
Fucking lowlife.

56:48.442 --> 56:50.581
You undercover piece of shit.

56:50.779 --> 56:53.015
Does your mother know
what you do for a living?

56:53.210 --> 56:54.934
That's real funny.

56:55.898 --> 56:56.978
Watch your head.

57:02.139 --> 57:04.691
I think I know why Stevie didn't show.

57:05.050 --> 57:06.708
I think he set us up.

57:07.643 --> 57:10.163
The minute we make bail, he's dead.

57:11.226 --> 57:13.397
Him and his brother, Alvin.

57:32.411 --> 57:36.240
All right, I want every agent
working around the clock...

57:36.474 --> 57:39.540
...to keep this joker
out of the morgue and out of jail.

57:40.762 --> 57:43.796
He doesn't get so much
as a parking ticket or a hangnail.

57:48.475 --> 57:51.737
From now on, Alvin Sanders
leads a charmed life.

58:08.635 --> 58:10.424
Come on, come on.

58:10.938 --> 58:12.313
Alvin.

58:14.939 --> 58:16.280
Alvin, it's late.

58:16.475 --> 58:20.021
I know, but I really need
to talk to you right now.

58:20.986 --> 58:23.442
I got this for Gregory.

58:24.604 --> 58:27.986
-An egg?
-It's supposed to be magic.

58:28.187 --> 58:30.293
Anyway, he can't swallow it.

58:30.908 --> 58:32.314
Can I come in?

58:33.563 --> 58:35.057
Just for a minute?

58:36.572 --> 58:38.197
All right, but keep it down.

58:38.395 --> 58:40.436
-The baby's sleeping.
-All right.

58:48.635 --> 58:51.418
Did I ever tell you
that I had a very happy childhood?

58:51.612 --> 58:54.907
-That's not what Stevie says.
-Stevie.

58:55.420 --> 58:59.675
Dad used to pick me up every day
to take the cargo train to Manhattan.

58:59.868 --> 59:02.323
Go to the horse track.
I knew it really well.

59:02.524 --> 59:04.498
I know. Your dad trained horses.

59:05.372 --> 59:06.321
Not really.

59:08.668 --> 59:11.221
No. No, he was a....

59:11.676 --> 59:14.578
He was a groom. I lied about that.

59:17.884 --> 59:21.397
But he was a great groom.
With the thoroughbreds, he was magic.

59:22.236 --> 59:26.392
I say he was the best.
But, you know, job didn't pay shit.

59:27.932 --> 59:32.569
So, therefore, our Christmases,
we didn't get jack shit.

59:34.588 --> 59:36.247
Which really pissed him off.

59:36.444 --> 59:40.273
One day he just went to this toy store
and just stole all these toys.

59:40.476 --> 59:41.589
Robbed them.

59:41.788 --> 59:43.611
Brought the toys over to the crib.

59:43.837 --> 59:47.546
I was like, ''Damn, Santa Claus
got the wrong address or what?''

59:48.541 --> 59:52.883
So I'm bouncing from toy to toy
like I'm some kind of drunk dude.

59:53.885 --> 59:57.627
Mom's smiling. My father's smiling.

59:57.948 --> 59:59.574
It's all good, right?

01:00:02.556 --> 01:00:05.175
Then around 8:30, cops show up.

01:00:07.964 --> 01:00:10.834
Take the toys, take my father.

01:00:12.573 --> 01:00:15.323
But for about two and a half hours...

01:00:15.517 --> 01:00:18.648
...l had a very, very happy childhood.

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:21.850
Why are you telling me all this?

01:00:22.396 --> 01:00:24.087
Because I love you.

01:00:25.053 --> 01:00:26.907
Talk about a bunch of crap.

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:30.483
It's all in his file, sir.
It's all true.

01:00:30.685 --> 01:00:33.532
He knows so much,
why not get a job at the track?

01:00:33.725 --> 01:00:37.521
He's had a record since he's 14.
Can't work there with a record.

01:00:37.725 --> 01:00:40.027
Oh, they all got sob stories.

01:00:40.221 --> 01:00:42.392
He's just trying to get laid.

01:01:18.462 --> 01:01:20.600
What you use on your skin?
It's so soft.

01:01:27.102 --> 01:01:29.490
-You feel that?
-Oh, yeah.

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:33.138
You feel so good.

01:01:40.925 --> 01:01:43.381
-What's that smell?
-It's mango.

01:01:43.582 --> 01:01:47.292
Mango. Oh, mango!

01:01:50.942 --> 01:01:52.535
And some pineapple.

01:02:10.623 --> 01:02:14.005
Oh, shit. Who is he?

01:02:14.815 --> 01:02:18.524
All right, I'm gonna go to Starbucks
and get a Mango Grande.

01:02:20.575 --> 01:02:23.357
-Mocha.
-Mocha Cappuccino.

01:02:32.703 --> 01:02:33.848
Who is it?

01:02:34.111 --> 01:02:36.184
Registered letter for Alvin Sanders.

01:02:36.383 --> 01:02:38.903
-Who's it from?
-Uncle Sam.

01:02:39.103 --> 01:02:43.292
Damn. I just got out, man.
Why you bugging me? I know my rights.

01:02:43.486 --> 01:02:46.302
It says in the Constitution
on page 53, ''We the People...

01:02:46.495 --> 01:02:50.139
...in order to keep shit straight--''
Quit messing with me.

01:02:50.463 --> 01:02:52.186
I think it's a check.

01:02:54.719 --> 01:02:55.996
Good afternoon.

01:02:56.287 --> 01:02:58.392
Where l-- Let me see where I sign.

01:02:58.623 --> 01:03:00.184
I don't ever get no checks.

01:03:00.415 --> 01:03:04.954
I was about to go postal on you. No
pun intended. I know all about it.

01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:08.533
Y'all do it for real and everything.
You make the news--

01:03:08.734 --> 01:03:09.782
All right.

01:03:10.783 --> 01:03:13.205
Apologies from the federal government,
$5000?

01:03:13.759 --> 01:03:15.482
Guess it's your lucky day.

01:03:16.735 --> 01:03:19.582
Hey, man, tell Uncle Sam
he cool with me, man.

01:03:19.775 --> 01:03:21.368
Apology accepted.

01:03:22.368 --> 01:03:25.117
Tell him he can come through
anytime he want to.

01:03:25.311 --> 01:03:27.286
Five G's. I'm up in there!

01:03:27.487 --> 01:03:29.526
-I'm up in there!
-Sir?

01:03:29.759 --> 01:03:31.898
You think maybe we gave him too much?

01:03:32.127 --> 01:03:35.476
Let's just hope this keeps him
out of trouble for a couple weeks.

01:03:58.976 --> 01:04:02.107
Excuse me, Afrikanic soul sister,
but do you have the book:

01:04:02.336 --> 01:04:04.922
Butt-naked in the Forest,
But Does Anybody Hear Me?

01:04:05.152 --> 01:04:06.493
What are you doing here?

01:04:06.687 --> 01:04:08.411
What? I'm here to see you.

01:04:08.896 --> 01:04:11.416
Listen, I got great news.

01:04:12.032 --> 01:04:13.821
You found a job!

01:04:15.168 --> 01:04:17.175
No, no, not yet.

01:04:17.376 --> 01:04:19.318
But I got something better than that.

01:04:19.519 --> 01:04:22.170
You said things would
be different this time.

01:04:22.367 --> 01:04:25.881
Things are very different.
Look at this.

01:04:26.081 --> 01:04:28.666
I got a check from the government
for $5000.

01:04:29.888 --> 01:04:33.303
The government gave you $5000.
All right, tell me anything.

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:37.017
The government gave me a check.
I signed it over to you.

01:04:37.249 --> 01:04:41.504
What the fuck is he doing?
That's our money he's giving away.

01:04:41.697 --> 01:04:43.638
Actually, it's taxpayer money.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.321
I could give you this money.
It'll pay for some of the things...

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:51.098
...like the back rent.
Some of the money I borrowed--

01:04:51.297 --> 01:04:52.824
Like the stereo you sold.

01:04:53.216 --> 01:04:55.453
-I sold the stereo?
-Or the VCR you took.

01:04:55.648 --> 01:04:58.681
-I took the VCR?
-The blender my mama gave me.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:02.426
The blender was cheap. I didn't get
that much money for the blender.

01:05:03.872 --> 01:05:06.077
I'm not taking it, Alvin.

01:05:07.809 --> 01:05:09.499
I don't think you understand.

01:05:10.048 --> 01:05:12.667
I been trying to get a job.
It's hard right now.

01:05:12.865 --> 01:05:15.931
That's a lot of money.
I think you need it more than I do.

01:05:16.193 --> 01:05:18.430
Take some money
and get Gregory something.

01:05:18.625 --> 01:05:21.974
Get him platinum baby pieces
or something like that, you know.

01:05:22.176 --> 01:05:24.031
He'll probably be a little rapper.

01:05:24.225 --> 01:05:27.771
-No, maybe he's gonna be a doctor.
-Why would he want to do that?

01:05:28.385 --> 01:05:32.892
Doctor's great. I was thinking--
You thinking like I'm thinking.

01:05:34.017 --> 01:05:38.327
Just take the money. Get him
some toys. Say it's from his father.

01:05:38.561 --> 01:05:42.008
Alvin, honestly, have you really
been trying to find a job?

01:05:42.241 --> 01:05:45.655
I have been out there.
You sound like my mom.

01:05:46.113 --> 01:05:49.725
I want you to get this money.
Go get you a nice dress.

01:05:50.241 --> 01:05:53.787
We can kick it. I can romance you.
Look at your brown eyes.

01:05:53.985 --> 01:05:55.229
Now, come on.

01:05:55.425 --> 01:05:58.458
Get back to work
before we both be out of work.

01:05:58.657 --> 01:06:00.446
Okay, step. Thank you.

01:06:02.113 --> 01:06:03.520
Sorry, my man.

01:06:04.866 --> 01:06:06.327
Don't mention it.

01:06:30.593 --> 01:06:31.542
Now what do we do?

01:06:31.746 --> 01:06:34.113
Simple. We give him more money.

01:06:34.306 --> 01:06:36.859
You sure that's necessary?
He 's trying to change.

01:06:37.058 --> 01:06:39.162
He 'll never change.

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:41.948
We just gotta keep him clean
for a few more days.

01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:45.272
-Well, how much money?
-Sixty-five hundred.

01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:47.963
Wouldn't it be cheaper
to send him to NYU?

01:06:48.545 --> 01:06:50.967
How do you feel about
working in Alaska?

01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:54.464
I'll get right on this.

01:07:24.002 --> 01:07:26.336
You gotta help me, man!
You gotta help me!

01:07:26.946 --> 01:07:28.256
Get your damn hands off me.

01:07:30.274 --> 01:07:32.281
Slow down coming through here, now.

01:07:34.947 --> 01:07:36.026
What's going on?

01:07:46.146 --> 01:07:47.423
Hey, you dropped your bag!

01:07:50.882 --> 01:07:52.792
Hey, man, you dropped your bag.

01:07:54.435 --> 01:07:56.606
Yo! You dropped your bag.

01:07:58.947 --> 01:08:01.282
Man, you done dropped your bag.

01:08:01.475 --> 01:08:04.126
You done dropped your bag. Oh, shit.

01:08:04.323 --> 01:08:05.752
Oh, shit.

01:08:09.123 --> 01:08:11.839
I'll take it to lost and found.

01:08:12.323 --> 01:08:13.916
Found where you lost it.

01:08:31.459 --> 01:08:35.582
Man, where you guys been?
Man, I was just thinking about you.

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:37.536
Your brother fucked us.

01:08:37.763 --> 01:08:40.032
Are you stupid?
This is my fucking car.

01:08:40.515 --> 01:08:41.464
This is my baby.

01:08:41.667 --> 01:08:43.423
Oh, sorry.

01:08:44.099 --> 01:08:45.888
Your brother fucked us!

01:08:46.084 --> 01:08:47.328
Look, all right. Cool.

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:48.952
How's your headache, though?

01:08:49.187 --> 01:08:51.424
-What headache?
-Does it hurt?

01:08:52.964 --> 01:08:54.555
I'm passing whuppings out.

01:08:55.203 --> 01:08:58.618
Okay, okay, I see what you doing.
You got the gun.

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.456
Stevie's fucking my girl, right?

01:09:04.131 --> 01:09:06.203
That's a point to take up with Stevie.

01:09:06.404 --> 01:09:11.073
Maybe Stevie don't want to be around
for us to make a point with him.

01:09:12.292 --> 01:09:13.786
What are you talking about?

01:09:13.988 --> 01:09:15.264
Stevie skipped out.

01:09:15.459 --> 01:09:17.631
Then say it. Don't get
so fucking complex.

01:09:17.828 --> 01:09:19.966
I'm not complex. You're complex.

01:09:20.196 --> 01:09:22.106
Do I need to be here for this shit?

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:23.267
Shut up!

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:24.768
Should we move in?

01:09:24.964 --> 01:09:27.233
Stay put. They're not gonna kill him.

01:09:27.428 --> 01:09:28.705
They're just having fun.

01:09:29.188 --> 01:09:30.529
They'll beat him to a pulp.

01:09:30.723 --> 01:09:32.698
I think that's
a reasonable assumption.

01:09:35.363 --> 01:09:37.403
I hope you like soup...

01:09:37.604 --> 01:09:40.419
...because I'm about to knock
every one of your teeth...

01:09:40.613 --> 01:09:43.033
-...down your throat.
-Excuse me.

01:09:43.268 --> 01:09:47.064
Can you tell me how to get to the
Fashion Museum? I'm a little lost.

01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:51.585
Put the gun down.

01:09:51.779 --> 01:09:54.880
What's your problem?
Go get lost somewhere else.

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.385
Ain't you shocked at how it went down?

01:10:05.413 --> 01:10:06.787
You came at the right time.

01:10:07.268 --> 01:10:08.894
We don't have much time, Alvin.

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:10.787
What you talking about?

01:10:10.981 --> 01:10:12.988
There's a question you need to answer.

01:10:13.796 --> 01:10:16.350
-That's him! That's our man!
-Shit!

01:10:21.989 --> 01:10:24.029
Unit 2, approach from the south.

01:10:26.085 --> 01:10:28.987
You need to answer my question.
How you know my name?

01:10:29.732 --> 01:10:31.423
I'll see you soon, Alvin.

01:10:39.748 --> 01:10:40.545
There he is!

01:10:40.741 --> 01:10:43.741
Shit, damn. Damn!

01:10:49.765 --> 01:10:50.910
What's going on?

01:10:51.493 --> 01:10:53.250
He 's in the coffee shop.

01:10:53.862 --> 01:10:55.322
Get out of the way.

01:11:18.182 --> 01:11:20.286
Get some guys at both ends
of the alley.

01:11:28.934 --> 01:11:32.000
Want to hear the bad news?
You're alone in a room with me.

01:11:33.766 --> 01:11:35.010
I think it's a check.

01:11:35.206 --> 01:11:36.994
Guess it's your lucky day.

01:11:38.822 --> 01:11:41.374
Sir. We're ready here, sir.

01:12:16.743 --> 01:12:18.847
I thought I'd find you here.

01:12:19.046 --> 01:12:21.534
I did too.
You want a drink or something?

01:12:21.735 --> 01:12:23.261
No, I need to talk to you.

01:12:23.462 --> 01:12:25.405
-Right now?
-Let's go, right now.

01:12:26.598 --> 01:12:29.500
I'm coming. I'll be right back.
Fucking ass.

01:12:34.214 --> 01:12:36.636
What y'all doing
in the men's bathroom?

01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:41.669
Alvin, man, what's happening?
Man, what's wrong?

01:12:42.022 --> 01:12:43.135
By yourself?

01:12:43.367 --> 01:12:44.577
Not now. Not now.

01:12:44.774 --> 01:12:46.749
Everything in here's broke.

01:12:48.423 --> 01:12:49.884
What's happening?

01:12:50.087 --> 01:12:53.121
Have you ever heard of a man getting
$5000 dropped in his lap?

01:12:53.319 --> 01:12:54.431
Never.

01:12:55.398 --> 01:12:56.925
What about twice in one day?

01:12:57.126 --> 01:12:58.850
You got ten G's?

01:12:59.367 --> 01:13:00.195
I got more than that.

01:13:00.391 --> 01:13:02.147
-Let me see.
-Calm down.

01:13:02.343 --> 01:13:04.252
I need you to keep this for me, okay?

01:13:04.455 --> 01:13:08.481
I gotta get out of town because
there's some strange shit going on.

01:13:08.775 --> 01:13:10.597
-All right?
-Okay.

01:13:12.487 --> 01:13:13.894
Read the note.

01:13:14.087 --> 01:13:16.804
Stevie, read the note.
Are you listening to me?

01:13:16.999 --> 01:13:20.261
Oh, yeah. I just wanted to let
you know I'm looking up to you.

01:13:20.455 --> 01:13:21.699
I look up to you.

01:13:21.895 --> 01:13:24.579
Look up to me another time, all right?
Stevie?

01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:26.662
I need you to do the right thing.

01:13:32.486 --> 01:13:35.040
Be careful, Alvin. For sure.

01:13:40.391 --> 01:13:41.471
Shit!

01:13:42.727 --> 01:13:47.462
I want both mobile units to maintain
visual contact. If he leaves town...

01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:50.625
...l want to know where he's going
before he does.

01:13:50.824 --> 01:13:52.733
What if our killer can't find him?

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.136
We'll just have to make sure he can.

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:08.031
Oh, my nuts.

01:14:09.575 --> 01:14:11.997
My balls. My balls.

01:14:15.176 --> 01:14:17.348
Okay, tickets.

01:14:27.016 --> 01:14:28.194
Is that you, Alveen?

01:14:29.383 --> 01:14:30.910
Alveen!

01:14:37.704 --> 01:14:39.492
-Shut up.
-Get your ass in here!

01:14:39.687 --> 01:14:41.346
My name is Alvin, not ''Alveen.''

01:14:41.576 --> 01:14:45.056
How could you give out
my e-mail address? That is personal.

01:14:45.288 --> 01:14:47.907
I don't even know it,
and if I did...

01:14:48.104 --> 01:14:49.795
...nobody wants to talk you.

01:14:49.992 --> 01:14:54.432
You must've given it to somebody.
There's a message in your name.

01:14:54.632 --> 01:14:57.251
And nobody just breaks into Netscape.
Okay?

01:14:57.448 --> 01:14:59.303
Nobody is that smart.

01:15:01.865 --> 01:15:04.713
''Hello, Alvin, it seems
we have some unfinished business.

01:15:04.903 --> 01:15:07.654
Unfortunately, your phones
are being tapped...

01:15:07.848 --> 01:15:10.149
...and you're being followed. ''

01:15:10.344 --> 01:15:11.871
Someone's been listening--

01:15:12.073 --> 01:15:13.895
Tika, not now, not now.

01:15:14.281 --> 01:15:15.906
''You have a beautiful son.

01:15:16.136 --> 01:15:19.846
It would be a shame if you didn't
follow these instructions.

01:15:20.457 --> 01:15:23.359
Leave the apartment
at exactly 4 p.m...

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.666
...and go to the following address.''

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.134
He's moving.

01:15:27.336 --> 01:15:31.297
''Take a taxi to the Fifth Avenue
and 53rd Street subway station.

01:15:31.496 --> 01:15:33.831
Get on the first subway car you see. ''

01:15:34.473 --> 01:15:37.156
Here we go.
I want to make this clear at the top:

01:15:37.512 --> 01:15:39.007
I prefer the suspect alive.

01:15:39.497 --> 01:15:42.147
But if anything goes wrong,
don't hesitate.

01:15:42.344 --> 01:15:43.751
Take him out, no matter what.

01:15:43.945 --> 01:15:46.531
If the only way to get to him
is through Alvin...

01:15:46.985 --> 01:15:48.163
...so be it.

01:15:48.873 --> 01:15:50.117
You shoot...

01:15:50.441 --> 01:15:52.196
...l'll answer the letters.

01:15:52.712 --> 01:15:55.648
Just give me 60 minutes, people,
without any fuckups...

01:15:55.945 --> 01:15:57.570
...you can have a nice vacation.

01:15:58.729 --> 01:16:00.900
One more block and he gets a cab.

01:16:10.121 --> 01:16:11.104
Be alert.

01:16:11.305 --> 01:16:15.167
This guy may not wait for Alvin
to get to the rendezvous point.

01:16:15.497 --> 01:16:16.544
Got you.

01:16:26.890 --> 01:16:29.507
He's headed your way.
He'll be there in three minutes.

01:16:29.993 --> 01:16:31.422
No problem.

01:16:35.882 --> 01:16:40.038
Well, I'm not certain that's
entirely accurate, Agent Wooly.

01:16:40.938 --> 01:16:42.727
Arms at your side.

01:16:43.754 --> 01:16:45.663
Let's take a little walk, shall we?

01:17:03.081 --> 01:17:05.831
Alvin's passed Wooly,
but there's no confirmation.

01:17:06.025 --> 01:17:07.814
His radio's out, sir.

01:17:08.266 --> 01:17:09.892
What do you mean, his radio's out?

01:17:10.091 --> 01:17:12.457
-I just talked to him.
-There's no response.

01:17:12.650 --> 01:17:16.446
-Well, what about Sanders?
-He's proceeding exactly as told.

01:17:16.650 --> 01:17:17.959
What's next? The subway?

01:17:18.154 --> 01:17:19.648
Train's just arriving.

01:17:23.626 --> 01:17:26.822
Alert Wood and Boyle, and keep
trying Wooly. I'm headed out.

01:17:51.371 --> 01:17:54.666
IKeep your eyes open, everybody.
He's at the phone booth.

01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:56.451
We 're in position.

01:18:13.450 --> 01:18:15.044
I'm at the red bench.

01:18:18.091 --> 01:18:19.651
They're all red benches.

01:18:22.059 --> 01:18:24.546
That's him. This is it.
This is it. Let's go!

01:18:25.707 --> 01:18:26.655
Out of the way!

01:18:30.698 --> 01:18:33.481
Stop right there!
I said, stop your car right there!

01:18:34.923 --> 01:18:36.450
Out of my way!

01:18:49.995 --> 01:18:51.075
Watch his hands.

01:18:57.227 --> 01:18:57.990
Game's over.

01:18:58.924 --> 01:19:00.581
I'm just sitting on the bench.

01:19:01.803 --> 01:19:04.553
Cordon off the area.
Cordon off the area! Go!

01:19:04.748 --> 01:19:08.261
What in the hell is going on?
What are you doing here?

01:19:08.459 --> 01:19:12.682
I heard y'all were giving away $5000.
I thought I'd come and get me some.

01:19:14.636 --> 01:19:16.610
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.492
My brother gave me money and a note...

01:19:19.692 --> 01:19:23.237
...to e-mail him some fucked-up
James Bond shit and meet him here.

01:19:23.436 --> 01:19:24.745
Ain't no crime in that.

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:27.623
-Alvin set this up?
-Damn, you getting smarter.

01:19:31.212 --> 01:19:35.140
You think this is a game? You and
your stupid brother, you asshole.

01:19:35.404 --> 01:19:37.640
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

01:19:37.836 --> 01:19:40.357
He ain't too stupid.
He got your ass down here.

01:19:51.948 --> 01:19:53.889
This is just, you know, fried hummus.

01:19:54.092 --> 01:19:55.816
-Piece of shit!
-You!

01:19:56.012 --> 01:19:57.387
Get your hands off me.

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:02.404
I'm just trying to get a ride.

01:20:02.637 --> 01:20:04.262
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

01:20:04.492 --> 01:20:06.183
You promised we'd go to the track.

01:20:06.381 --> 01:20:09.544
She's not running till the 7th race.
Get in the fucking car.

01:20:11.341 --> 01:20:14.210
You owe me a falafel, motherfucker.

01:20:19.564 --> 01:20:23.493
This the wrong time for this.
I need to go to the crib right now.

01:20:23.693 --> 01:20:26.059
You won't be seeing home
for a long time.

01:20:26.252 --> 01:20:28.871
How many times I gotta say
I don't know where Stevie is?

01:20:29.068 --> 01:20:31.654
Fuck Stevie, okay?
This is about you.

01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:35.617
This is about you and your friend
who buzzed me with that thing.

01:20:35.852 --> 01:20:38.536
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
He's after me.

01:20:41.772 --> 01:20:43.016
-How'd you do that?
-What?

01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:46.280
-What the fuck? How'd you do that?
-How'd I do what?

01:20:46.476 --> 01:20:47.753
That came out of the radio.

01:20:47.949 --> 01:20:51.210
-He's a ventriloquist, this guy.
-A what?

01:20:51.405 --> 01:20:54.155
-You know, the guy does the shit--
-Like a DJ?

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:56.869
-Hello?
-Like the guys with the dummies.

01:20:57.069 --> 01:20:59.939
You know, with the voices
and the dummies and shit.

01:21:00.142 --> 01:21:03.719
Yeah, yeah. He didn't tell you?
I'm a ventriloquist.

01:21:03.949 --> 01:21:06.119
We're traveling in a black Mercedes...

01:21:06.349 --> 01:21:09.765
... with two Bert-and-Ernie-
Iooking motherfuckers inside...

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:10.924
...on Madison Ave.

01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:14.892
Look at you. You suck.
I could see your lips moving.

01:21:15.085 --> 01:21:18.500
We about to move past 59th Street.
I'm gonna need backup.

01:21:18.701 --> 01:21:20.840
I'm gonna need backup. One Adam- 12.

01:21:21.037 --> 01:21:23.371
Code three. I need backup.
I need backup.

01:21:23.565 --> 01:21:24.678
Who's he talking to?

01:21:24.877 --> 01:21:26.252
Emergency, I need backup.

01:21:26.446 --> 01:21:27.787
Shut him the fuck up!

01:21:34.221 --> 01:21:35.236
We got a problem.

01:21:38.061 --> 01:21:40.680
Oh, shit! Oh, fuck me!

01:21:46.638 --> 01:21:47.783
What are you doing?

01:21:47.981 --> 01:21:50.699
Don't point that gun at me!
Don't point that gun at me!

01:21:53.933 --> 01:21:56.138
-You shot me, bitch.
-Look out for the bus!

01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:32.684
Oh, God, please!

01:22:34.415 --> 01:22:35.756
God, give me strength!

01:22:42.415 --> 01:22:43.844
Oh, shit!

01:22:45.101 --> 01:22:47.523
-Shoot the bag!
-All right, look out.

01:22:49.263 --> 01:22:51.596
God, I can't breathe. Open the door!

01:22:52.271 --> 01:22:54.573
Where you going?
Alvin, get back here.

01:22:54.767 --> 01:22:56.359
Get back here. Help us out!

01:23:01.422 --> 01:23:03.789
-I lost mobility.
-Just look at my car!

01:23:05.006 --> 01:23:07.461
I hate this guy.
He's the fucking devil.

01:23:07.662 --> 01:23:09.256
Alvin Sanders is the devil.

01:23:17.006 --> 01:23:19.047
What are you doing? Open the window.

01:23:19.279 --> 01:23:22.507
What are we, goldfish?
Help us out of here!

01:23:24.047 --> 01:23:28.717
It's a blackout situation.
We are negative on all signals.

01:23:31.376 --> 01:23:33.230
Scanning visual matrix.

01:23:35.759 --> 01:23:36.708
Negative.

01:23:37.136 --> 01:23:40.299
-We could try to isolate a pitch.
-It's a million-to-one shot.

01:23:41.455 --> 01:23:45.284
I would like to make a deal with
the United States Treasury Department.

01:23:45.999 --> 01:23:46.927
Sir?

01:23:47.887 --> 01:23:50.222
-It's Wooly's channel.
-Can we trace it?

01:23:50.415 --> 01:23:53.132
I'd like to trade the life
ofa Treasury agent. ..

01:23:53.327 --> 01:23:55.050
...for the 42 million in gold.

01:23:55.247 --> 01:23:56.294
Transferring signal.

01:23:56.495 --> 01:24:00.619
Since you don't have my gold,
I'll settle for the next best thing.

01:24:01.488 --> 01:24:05.262
If you want Mr. Wooly alive,
turn over Mr. Sanders to me.

01:24:05.455 --> 01:24:07.943
Midtown Winslett, 36th Street.

01:25:03.184 --> 01:25:04.711
Lisa, what's wrong with you?

01:25:09.936 --> 01:25:11.430
Girl, what's wrong with you?

01:25:34.449 --> 01:25:37.067
Alvin! Alvin, get up, baby.

01:25:46.801 --> 01:25:48.556
Please get up.

01:25:51.281 --> 01:25:54.248
Baby, get up. Come on, Alvin.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:58.670
Come on, come on, please get up.
Alvin, please get up.

01:25:59.024 --> 01:26:01.326
Why are you doing this to us?

01:26:01.521 --> 01:26:04.073
Why? Why are you doing this to us?

01:26:50.609 --> 01:26:51.983
Give us a break.

01:27:07.634 --> 01:27:09.456
Did you have a nice sleep?

01:27:10.162 --> 01:27:11.406
What'd you do with Lisa?

01:27:11.602 --> 01:27:13.871
I put her in the other room
with Gregory.

01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:16.199
They're fine.

01:27:16.723 --> 01:27:20.268
This is New York. We don't play
these type of games here.

01:27:20.466 --> 01:27:23.117
You see, Alvin,
I just want what's mine.

01:27:23.442 --> 01:27:26.312
I was used by the government,
and now they're using you.

01:27:26.514 --> 01:27:28.848
I have nothing
to do with the government.

01:27:29.074 --> 01:27:30.503
Oh, yes, you do.

01:27:31.058 --> 01:27:33.065
They used you to get to me...

01:27:33.298 --> 01:27:35.665
...and I might add, quite effectively.

01:27:35.890 --> 01:27:37.232
Here I am.

01:27:37.779 --> 01:27:39.633
Now for your sake...

01:27:40.146 --> 01:27:43.016
...let's hope you can help me
find my gold.

01:27:44.178 --> 01:27:45.356
Gold?

01:28:03.091 --> 01:28:04.105
Give me a pen.

01:28:09.714 --> 01:28:13.577
I would like to make a deal with
the United States Treasury Department.

01:28:13.778 --> 01:28:14.726
That son of a bitch.

01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:16.938
I'd like to trade the life
ofa Treasury agent--

01:28:17.139 --> 01:28:19.408
He knew Alvin was being surveilled.

01:28:20.882 --> 01:28:24.200
This whole thing was just a diversion.

01:28:24.595 --> 01:28:26.416
If you want Mr. Wooly--

01:28:29.299 --> 01:28:31.186
All right, the drill is simple.

01:28:32.819 --> 01:28:34.794
We find Alvin before he does.

01:28:35.027 --> 01:28:37.994
The math on this
is extremely problematic.

01:28:38.227 --> 01:28:39.471
You have information.

01:28:40.404 --> 01:28:41.963
I need it.

01:28:42.386 --> 01:28:45.551
You don't provide that information,
I have to kill you.

01:28:50.996 --> 01:28:53.581
What are my options?

01:28:55.219 --> 01:28:56.201
Well....

01:29:00.979 --> 01:29:02.124
Obviously...

01:29:03.091 --> 01:29:04.716
...there's torture.

01:29:05.171 --> 01:29:06.578
No, come on.

01:29:06.803 --> 01:29:09.553
You're more creative than that.
That's...uh-uh.

01:29:16.916 --> 01:29:19.304
That's a point well taken, Alvin.

01:29:20.435 --> 01:29:23.304
And besides, torture...

01:29:24.916 --> 01:29:26.443
-...it's unpleasant.
-Yeah.

01:29:26.772 --> 01:29:28.233
-It's loud.
-You're right.

01:29:28.883 --> 01:29:30.410
So unpredictable.

01:29:30.612 --> 01:29:32.205
Wait, no, hold on. No, wait.

01:29:36.436 --> 01:29:37.364
See...

01:29:37.588 --> 01:29:39.344
...did that really hurt?

01:29:39.571 --> 01:29:42.288
And if so, how much?
Nobody really knows.

01:29:42.548 --> 01:29:45.231
But I will tell you this:
I do not have the time...

01:29:45.428 --> 01:29:49.170
...l do not have the manpower, and
I do not have the assets for error.

01:29:49.364 --> 01:29:52.332
Do you understand that?
Do you get that?

01:29:52.532 --> 01:29:56.110
I am tired of fucking around
with you, Alvin!

01:29:57.876 --> 01:30:01.650
When you get your money, you need
to get an anger management class.

01:30:01.844 --> 01:30:04.910
You! No, you're not very smart,
are you?

01:30:05.108 --> 01:30:08.403
The only reason you're alive
is because I allow it!

01:30:08.821 --> 01:30:11.635
Shut up! Shut up!

01:30:23.477 --> 01:30:26.029
You like little kids, right?
That's my boy in there.

01:30:26.292 --> 01:30:27.601
I can't let nothing happen to him.

01:30:27.796 --> 01:30:30.730
It don't matter what's going
on between us.

01:30:30.964 --> 01:30:31.912
I'll do anything.

01:30:32.117 --> 01:30:35.117
He ain't got nothing to do with this.
It's between us.

01:30:35.412 --> 01:30:36.721
Let's make this shit work.

01:30:36.917 --> 01:30:38.804
Let's go get that gold, man.

01:30:50.164 --> 01:30:52.881
I'm sorry for that primitive outburst.

01:30:55.477 --> 01:30:57.745
I've decided the best course
of action...

01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:02.642
...is to contrast the fear of certain
death with an indulgent incentive.

01:31:03.764 --> 01:31:06.186
Force you to choose
between the extremes.

01:31:07.668 --> 01:31:10.768
I'm prepared to offer you
the same deal I had with Jaster.

01:31:12.373 --> 01:31:16.629
We find the gold, you get to keep
six bricks to do with as you please.

01:31:17.525 --> 01:31:19.380
Roughly one million dollars.

01:31:21.078 --> 01:31:22.288
And, Alvin...

01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:26.932
...it's a one-time,
non-negotiable offer.

01:31:35.541 --> 01:31:37.396
All right, let me get this straight:

01:31:38.389 --> 01:31:40.364
The offer is a million dollars...

01:31:40.853 --> 01:31:42.315
...or you kill me.

01:31:43.413 --> 01:31:44.558
Correct.

01:31:44.789 --> 01:31:49.458
A million ain't what it used to be
with taxes. If that's all you got...

01:31:49.653 --> 01:31:51.214
...we'll work with that.

01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:53.234
Clear.

01:32:12.821 --> 01:32:13.967
What is that?

01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:18.157
It's coffee, sir.

01:32:19.318 --> 01:32:21.074
I wonder why he didn't kill him.

01:32:21.269 --> 01:32:22.513
Alvin must've talked.

01:32:22.710 --> 01:32:23.757
He doesn't know anything.

01:32:23.990 --> 01:32:26.706
I didn't say he knew anything.
I just said he talked.

01:32:27.606 --> 01:32:28.751
Secure the building.

01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:31.884
Check the stairwell to the roof.
Take more men.

01:32:33.718 --> 01:32:35.147
All right, let's go.

01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:48.976
She gonna be all right, right?

01:32:50.230 --> 01:32:53.165
She will be, if you do
what you're supposed to do.

01:32:54.358 --> 01:32:56.082
You're gonna have to trust me.

01:32:56.278 --> 01:33:00.533
I could trust you a lot better
if you would let my girl and kid go.

01:33:00.726 --> 01:33:03.060
No, no, no. I couldn't do that.

01:33:03.254 --> 01:33:06.124
Lisa and your little boy
are motivational tools.

01:33:12.822 --> 01:33:14.000
Air Unit, what do you got?

01:33:14.199 --> 01:33:15.093
We got nothing.

01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:18.164
-Do a sweep on channel 34.
-Affirmative.

01:33:18.454 --> 01:33:20.429
-Night vision.
-Negative.

01:33:20.663 --> 01:33:21.972
-Infrared.
-Negative.

01:33:22.199 --> 01:33:23.692
-We got nothing.
-No signal.

01:33:23.926 --> 01:33:27.407
Jesus! Alvin Sanders is a needle
in a haystack.

01:33:32.567 --> 01:33:33.776
Can I help you?

01:33:38.039 --> 01:33:39.729
All right, Detective Wooly, go ahead.

01:33:49.207 --> 01:33:51.858
The horses for the fifth race
are on the track.

01:34:14.488 --> 01:34:15.436
And they're off.

01:34:30.136 --> 01:34:31.444
Let's see what we have here.

01:34:31.639 --> 01:34:35.349
What are you doing? I told you it's
in the back stables, not here.

01:34:36.375 --> 01:34:37.422
I understand.

01:34:37.624 --> 01:34:40.559
Do you think he hid the shit
in a concession stand?

01:34:48.311 --> 01:34:50.134
This is perfect.

01:34:50.936 --> 01:34:52.496
Glad you like it.

01:34:58.488 --> 01:34:59.601
Hey...

01:34:59.832 --> 01:35:00.912
...hey, little man.

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.007
Daddy got to run out
and take care of some business.

01:35:06.264 --> 01:35:09.493
I'll be right back. You take care
of your mother, okay?

01:35:14.232 --> 01:35:15.639
I'm waiting, Alvin.

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:17.302
Yeah, I'm coming.

01:35:18.424 --> 01:35:19.831
All right, little player.

01:35:35.129 --> 01:35:36.787
What the hell is that?

01:35:36.985 --> 01:35:41.719
While I have no doubt about
your sincerity, if there is no gold...

01:35:41.912 --> 01:35:45.425
...l'm sure you'd agree,
there should be some penalty.

01:35:48.472 --> 01:35:50.097
We don't need these anymore...

01:35:50.296 --> 01:35:54.126
...considering there's no way my
little toy can be disarmed without me.

01:35:56.312 --> 01:35:57.392
All right, Alvin.

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:02.648
Lead the way.

01:36:03.673 --> 01:36:06.968
I told you the shit wasn't over here.
It's in the back, in the stalls.

01:36:07.193 --> 01:36:09.495
What if we don't get back in time?

01:36:09.690 --> 01:36:11.631
We gonna end up killing 5000 people.

01:36:11.832 --> 01:36:15.346
Perhaps we shouldn't be standing
around chatting, then.

01:36:16.056 --> 01:36:18.195
Mess around and I'll tell you what:

01:36:18.393 --> 01:36:22.069
Anything happen to my kid or girl,
it's gonna be bad for you.

01:36:35.002 --> 01:36:38.001
The horses are on the track.
It's a major race for 4-year-olds.

01:36:38.329 --> 01:36:39.409
How much gold is there?

01:36:39.641 --> 01:36:41.845
Roughly 42 million dollars.

01:36:42.041 --> 01:36:45.522
You the lncredible Hulk? How you
getting all this gold out of here?

01:36:51.610 --> 01:36:52.656
Here.

01:36:52.985 --> 01:36:54.447
Yeah. This is it.

01:37:01.274 --> 01:37:04.056
All right, here we are.
Right here. Nine.

01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:06.643
No, no, no, no.

01:37:07.322 --> 01:37:08.848
No, it's not very logical.

01:37:09.081 --> 01:37:10.129
Logical or not...

01:37:10.362 --> 01:37:13.591
...it's buried in the back.
Don't get it if you don't have to.

01:37:13.785 --> 01:37:15.379
I gotta get to my family.

01:37:15.577 --> 01:37:18.806
-I ain't gotta do shit for you--
-All right, open it.

01:37:19.002 --> 01:37:22.199
You can open it yourself.
I don't give a damn.

01:37:22.394 --> 01:37:23.190
Open it!

01:37:35.193 --> 01:37:36.176
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:37.588
It's all right.

01:37:39.098 --> 01:37:40.985
It's all right, big fella.

01:37:41.338 --> 01:37:42.680
Calm down, now. Calm down.

01:37:42.874 --> 01:37:45.623
Hold on, now.
Just calm down. It's all right.

01:37:45.818 --> 01:37:49.909
Easy, easy, easy, it's all right.
It's all right. Calm down.

01:38:31.738 --> 01:38:33.265
What the hell is that?

01:38:36.379 --> 01:38:39.542
Where's my fucking gold, Alvin?

01:38:39.739 --> 01:38:41.365
You soft.

01:38:48.858 --> 01:38:49.906
We got him.

01:38:51.291 --> 01:38:53.429
He's at the Manhattan Race Track.

01:38:53.627 --> 01:38:55.896
Get yo bitch ass up. Get up!

01:38:56.507 --> 01:38:58.928
Get some of this, huh?
Get some of this, huh?

01:38:59.131 --> 01:39:00.757
Chest, chest, chest, nuts!

01:39:05.435 --> 01:39:06.679
Oh, shit.

01:39:10.203 --> 01:39:13.204
The horses are now leaving
the paddock for the race.

01:39:49.596 --> 01:39:52.213
The horses are now all in the gate.

01:39:56.252 --> 01:39:57.048
And they're off.

01:39:59.036 --> 01:40:00.595
Bitch!

01:40:06.588 --> 01:40:07.995
Alvin!

01:40:16.027 --> 01:40:20.403
Frigid Pleasure in front
setting a blistering pace.

01:40:20.636 --> 01:40:24.346
Come on, Frigid Pleasure,
you motherfucker!

01:40:27.035 --> 01:40:29.272
That's my horse! That's my horse!

01:40:31.165 --> 01:40:32.375
Shit!

01:40:35.868 --> 01:40:36.915
What the fuck?

01:40:37.116 --> 01:40:40.532
-There's another horse on the field.
-Slow down, slow down!

01:40:44.349 --> 01:40:45.593
We need security!

01:40:46.525 --> 01:40:48.280
Move! I can't control this shit!

01:40:50.044 --> 01:40:52.216
The horses are still heading
for the wire!

01:40:52.444 --> 01:40:53.753
This is disastrous!

01:40:54.044 --> 01:40:55.059
You gotta stop!

01:40:55.292 --> 01:40:59.154
Ramirez tries to hold Frigid Pleasure,
but the horse has a mind ofits own!

01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:01.333
Look out!

01:41:13.628 --> 01:41:15.603
Get out of the way!
I can't control her!

01:41:16.765 --> 01:41:18.707
All the horses and riders are down!

01:41:18.909 --> 01:41:20.535
You don't listen, do you?

01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:23.610
You can slow down now.

01:41:23.806 --> 01:41:24.753
We coming to a railing.

01:41:24.988 --> 01:41:28.502
Do you see the people? Don't you see
the people? Put the brakes on.

01:41:34.492 --> 01:41:35.475
Couldn't be.

01:41:36.285 --> 01:41:37.463
It's him.

01:41:38.462 --> 01:41:39.955
It's the devil.

01:41:44.381 --> 01:41:46.136
In my 30 years ofracing...

01:41:46.333 --> 01:41:49.629
...l've never witnessed
a spectacle quite like this.

01:41:49.822 --> 01:41:50.933
Get out of the way!

01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:53.141
Police! Move! Move!

01:41:55.005 --> 01:41:56.052
Look out!

01:42:05.438 --> 01:42:06.779
Get out of the way!

01:42:28.861 --> 01:42:30.072
Excuse me.

01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:32.317
Get out of the way!

01:42:32.670 --> 01:42:34.557
Back up! Back up!

01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:38.045
Look out! Look out! Look out!
Excuse me!

01:42:38.238 --> 01:42:39.448
Damn!

01:42:48.542 --> 01:42:49.884
Hold it right there!

01:42:50.782 --> 01:42:51.730
Freeze!

01:43:02.206 --> 01:43:03.962
He's jumped. He's jumped.

01:43:17.054 --> 01:43:19.028
Lisa! Lisa, baby.

01:43:19.230 --> 01:43:22.045
Lisa, Lisa. Wake up, baby. Wake up.

01:43:22.943 --> 01:43:26.008
-I'm getting him out.
-What are you doing with Gregory?

01:43:34.367 --> 01:43:36.734
I know, I know, I know....

01:43:39.135 --> 01:43:42.233
Hold on. I'm gonna be
right there. Calm down, okay?

01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:44.253
I'll be right back to get you.

01:43:46.462 --> 01:43:47.771
Lisa, you got to wake up.

01:43:47.967 --> 01:43:49.691
Ain't nothing wrong with the baby.

01:43:49.951 --> 01:43:51.160
We got a situation.

01:43:51.358 --> 01:43:52.885
What is that?

01:43:53.599 --> 01:43:55.671
-That's a bomb, baby.
-A bomb?

01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:59.930
-It's a kaboom bomb, not a kapow bomb.
-That's a really big bomb. Pull it!

01:44:00.159 --> 01:44:01.086
Pull it!

01:44:09.119 --> 01:44:10.712
Come on, Alvin.

01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:15.187
Where's the baby? I can hear him.
Where's my baby, Alvin?

01:44:15.392 --> 01:44:17.333
What's that? What's that?

01:44:17.534 --> 01:44:20.470
All right. Turn your head.

01:44:20.671 --> 01:44:23.388
Hurry up. Come on.
What's going on?

01:44:23.583 --> 01:44:25.558
Turn your face!

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.028
Oh, God, Alvin. Where's the baby?

01:44:28.223 --> 01:44:31.639
Come on and burn it. Get it out.
Where's the--

01:44:35.167 --> 01:44:38.483
I can hear the baby.
Where's my baby, Alvin?

01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:40.094
Shit!

01:44:40.608 --> 01:44:43.291
Just take the baby.
Just take the baby and run.

01:44:49.087 --> 01:44:51.957
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's go get the baby now!

01:44:55.327 --> 01:44:58.328
-Get him! I gotta take care of this!
-Alvin, no!

01:45:03.935 --> 01:45:05.277
Shit.

01:45:05.568 --> 01:45:06.975
What the fuck? Fuck that.

01:45:07.456 --> 01:45:10.073
Some shit I do know how
to do right here.

01:45:21.696 --> 01:45:24.315
Oh, shit. Get out of the way!

01:45:24.639 --> 01:45:26.745
I got a bomb. You got to move!

01:45:26.944 --> 01:45:28.538
Move the horses.

01:45:29.184 --> 01:45:30.776
Get blown up, then.

01:45:32.544 --> 01:45:34.301
Move out of the way!

01:45:39.136 --> 01:45:40.280
Oh, shit, the brakes!

01:45:41.216 --> 01:45:42.743
No! Oh, shit!

01:45:42.976 --> 01:45:45.115
Running out of time. Oh, shit!

01:45:47.488 --> 01:45:48.765
Brakes!

01:45:58.144 --> 01:45:59.257
Oh, shit!

01:47:05.473 --> 01:47:06.750
Hey!

01:47:22.817 --> 01:47:25.206
Now, come on.
Man, you almost shot me!

01:47:25.409 --> 01:47:26.620
Shit!

01:47:27.009 --> 01:47:29.049
You could've fucked around
and shot me.

01:47:30.913 --> 01:47:32.124
But I didn't.

01:47:32.802 --> 01:47:34.526
Well, I guess I owe you one.

01:47:37.090 --> 01:47:39.424
-I guess you do.
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:47:43.458 --> 01:47:46.589
-Hey!
-Oh, man, this trick shoulder.

01:47:46.817 --> 01:47:48.705
It's from the gunshot.
I got reflexes.

01:47:48.898 --> 01:47:50.556
I can't really control my shit.

01:47:51.938 --> 01:47:53.825
I suppose I had that coming.

01:47:55.299 --> 01:47:56.246
It's okay.

01:47:56.833 --> 01:47:58.689
Get that piece of shit out of here.

01:48:00.034 --> 01:48:02.784
Y'all did bust me upside the head
with a brick.

01:48:04.226 --> 01:48:05.753
We did a lot more than that.

01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:09.858
You didn't touch me
in different places? Because--

01:48:10.051 --> 01:48:14.174
No. Whether you know or not, you
did a good thing for your country.

01:48:14.370 --> 01:48:17.915
We need to talk about what
the country's gonna do for me.

01:48:18.146 --> 01:48:19.968
I ain't having a good day.

01:48:20.674 --> 01:48:22.103
You got some aspirin on you?

01:48:22.337 --> 01:48:23.745
You want chewable?

01:48:24.034 --> 01:48:26.402
You be rolling with the shit
in your pocket?

01:48:27.554 --> 01:48:29.725
-You don't smoke, do you?
-No.

01:48:35.522 --> 01:48:36.864
You got some water?

01:48:50.307 --> 01:48:53.209
Oh, boy. Look. Yes, sir.

01:48:53.443 --> 01:48:54.555
Hey, you two.

01:48:54.786 --> 01:48:57.470
Hey, what's happening? Oh, man....

01:48:57.667 --> 01:49:00.001
-Y'all have fun?
-Yeah, we had a good time.

01:49:03.171 --> 01:49:04.577
Let's make another one.

01:49:04.994 --> 01:49:06.751
We had a question to ask you.

01:49:06.946 --> 01:49:07.895
What might that be?

01:49:08.195 --> 01:49:12.221
My man G has already mastered
the craft of eating applesauce.

01:49:12.643 --> 01:49:15.228
He's a genius like me.
We're thinking of moving up...

01:49:15.427 --> 01:49:19.519
...to peanut butter, but I don't want
his mouth to get stuck all together.

01:49:19.747 --> 01:49:21.721
Baby, he already eats peanut butter.

01:49:21.954 --> 01:49:25.303
Look at that. I can't believe
you had me come all the way here.

01:49:25.539 --> 01:49:26.783
You done bamboozled me.

01:49:26.979 --> 01:49:28.059
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

01:49:28.387 --> 01:49:31.453
I'm looking for The Bronx Zoo
by Sparky Lyle.

01:49:31.747 --> 01:49:35.163
The Bronx Zoo? Did you try upstairs
in the nature section?

01:49:35.364 --> 01:49:37.403
It's not about nature.
It's about baseball.

01:49:37.603 --> 01:49:38.781
The Yankees?

01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:41.762
Yankee Stadium?
They call it the Bronx Zoo.

01:49:41.955 --> 01:49:44.607
Okay. Check in the back
on the left side, in sports.

01:49:44.803 --> 01:49:46.144
Bronx Zoo?

01:49:47.011 --> 01:49:48.670
''There's no place...

01:49:49.187 --> 01:49:50.562
...like home.''

01:49:51.683 --> 01:49:53.920
I need to make a phone call...

01:49:54.499 --> 01:49:55.448
...to my accountant.

01:50:00.068 --> 01:50:00.995
Clenteen.

01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:02.364
Edgar, what's up?

01:50:02.563 --> 01:50:04.986
I'm hurt. You never write.
You don't call.

01:50:05.188 --> 01:50:06.530
Alvin, how you doing?

01:50:06.724 --> 01:50:09.178
I'm doing pretty good.
About to do a lot better.

01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:12.314
Let me ask you: what's your
policy on finder's fees?

01:50:12.515 --> 01:50:14.109
That depends on what you find.

01:50:14.307 --> 01:50:15.966
How about $40 million in gold?

01:50:16.164 --> 01:50:18.684
-You know where the gold is?
-I might.

01:50:18.884 --> 01:50:20.378
Don't mess with me, Alvin.

01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:22.914
I got a pretty good idea
of where it is.

01:50:23.107 --> 01:50:24.537
It's in the back ofmy head.

01:50:24.772 --> 01:50:26.714
What's it gonna take
to get it to the front?

01:50:26.948 --> 01:50:29.151
-You tell me.
-How does five percent sound?

01:50:29.348 --> 01:50:31.356
Five percent?
Five percent is bullshit!

01:50:31.588 --> 01:50:33.016
Two million dollars is bullshit?

01:50:33.251 --> 01:50:35.390
Oh, that's five percent,
is two million?

01:50:35.588 --> 01:50:39.330
Oh, well, I see. I was multiplying
and forgot to carry the two.

01:50:39.524 --> 01:50:41.379
I carried it, just not far enough.

01:50:41.572 --> 01:50:44.223
What I'm saying is,
two million dollars could work.

01:50:44.419 --> 01:50:46.045
I've got to explain some things.

01:50:46.244 --> 01:50:47.837
Med school for Gregory ain 't cheap.

01:50:48.037 --> 01:50:49.563
Where's the gold, Alvin?

01:50:49.764 --> 01:50:51.106
Let me ask you something:

01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:53.024
Do you like baseball?

01:50:54.305 --> 01:51:00.531
