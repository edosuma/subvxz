12:24.036 --> 12:27.574
Well, I help out my son
at his florist shop and nursery,

12:27.664 --> 12:30.997
andJared came in to buy
an orchid for his mother.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.075
He was full ofanxiety.

12:33.170 --> 12:36.583
- Probably about microbes,
Booth.
- Uh, afraid of germs.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.335
I picked out an orchid,
and I took it out to his car,

12:39.426 --> 12:41.417
and he was very appreciative.

12:41.511 --> 12:45.003
And— [ Laughs]
I thought he wasjust adorable.

12:45.098 --> 12:48.841
So I asked him out to dinner,
and the rest is history.

12:48.936 --> 12:52.599
He fell in love with me,
and I responded.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.598
/ared’s mother thought he was
at the hotel writing his book,

12:56.693 --> 12:59.105
but there’s no record
ofhim checking in.

12:59.196 --> 13:01.687
He was at the hotel,
but for a conference.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.398
Right, with the, uh,
science-fiction writers.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.404
No, for behavior modification.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.406
Ifhe was trying
to overcome his—

13:08.497 --> 13:10.579
If he was trying to overcome
his psychological issues,
that might’ve threatened her.

13:10.666 --> 13:13.954
- With your support?
- Of course.

13:15.170 --> 13:18.162
Look, I only wanted
what was best forJared.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.167
I’m not a crazy person.

13:23.845 --> 13:27.508
I’ve looked at the remains
over and over, and I can’t
find any cause ofdeath.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.806
Without the head,
we may never discover
cause ofdeath.

13:29.893 --> 13:33.477
And without cause ofdeath,
it’s much less likely
that we’ll solve the crime.

13:33.563 --> 13:37.055
This fracture on
the right metacarpal,
on the last two fingers?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.641
It’s got a nickname:
the boxer’s fracture.

13:39.736 --> 13:43.194
It happens ifyou slug someone
without keeping your wrist
dead straight.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.693
So—

13:45.826 --> 13:49.569
How did you know that?
I fought Golden Gloves
when I was a kid.

13:49.663 --> 13:52.200
You x-ray my hand,
it don’t look much different
than this.

13:52.290 --> 13:56.124
I don’t expect anyone to
live up to Zack’s standards,
Mr. Bray,

13:56.211 --> 13:58.497
but that is
extremely good work.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.086
Mery
have you ever conducted
a sexual relationship...

14:04.177 --> 14:07.544
with a woman over 20 years
older than yourself?

14:11.226 --> 14:13.933
I ask because,
anthropologically speaking,
there’s a correlation...

14:14.021 --> 14:18.185
between
physically aggressive young
males and sexual precocity.

14:21.528 --> 14:25.441
Um, I’m pretty sure you aren’t
any 20 years older than me,
Dr. Brennan.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.864
Why would my age
be relevant?

14:29.578 --> 14:33.617
Very good work
on the boxer’s fracture.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.998
[Zack]
What’d you bring me, Hodgins?

14:41.089 --> 14:43.205
Huh?

14:43.300 --> 14:46.292
Try and figure this one out.

14:46.386 --> 14:50.550
Well, a lemma on its own
is difficult to solve because
the solution changes...

14:50.640 --> 14:55.430
dependent upon whether or not
the subsequent proposition
is auxiliary or subsidiary.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.476
So I got you beat,
right?

14:57.564 --> 15:00.397
[Inhales Sharply]
Yep. That makes me
king ofthe—

15:01.735 --> 15:03.566
That-That makes me king.

15:05.363 --> 15:09.857
We’re gonna get you
outta here someday, Zack,
and you can be king again.

15:09.951 --> 15:13.443
I know you’re lying
to make me feel better
and not to be malicious.

15:16.333 --> 15:20.076
Want to hear about the case
we’re working on now?
Body in 12 pieces.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.537
- And get this— no head.
- So 13 pieces.

15:23.632 --> 15:27.921
The linear functional must
be bounded before you apply
the R/esz represen ta t/on.

15:28.011 --> 15:31.970
- What?
- The characteristic polynomial
ofa differential operator...

15:32.057 --> 15:35.015
is not the same thing as
the characteristic polynomial
ofa matrix.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.099
You solved it?
Yes.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.429
I’m king of the loony bin.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.480
Yeah, you are.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.606
Hey, I got an idea.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.688
I’m gonna leave
the case file with you.

15:49.783 --> 15:54.117
It’s got all the X-rays so far,
all the data. Maybe you’ll find
something we missed, huh?

15:54.204 --> 15:56.786
I’ve done that
many times in the past.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.116
Angela says you and she
aren’t together anymore.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.957
Yeah, you know—

16:05.048 --> 16:07.539
I’m sorry things
are going badly foryou.

16:07.634 --> 16:11.627
- [ Laughing]
- Why are you laughing?

16:11.721 --> 16:14.588
My best friend is locked up
in a loony bin,

16:14.683 --> 16:17.049
wearing gloves because
he blew up his own hands,

16:17.144 --> 16:19.977
and he feels sorry for me.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.142
[Laughing]

16:25.360 --> 16:27.271
Mud is not dangerous.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.444
Mud’s not toxic.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.522
Mud’s not poisonous.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.868
Mud will not hurt you.

16:33.952 --> 16:37.820
What you’re gonna do is
dip your hand in the bucket,
and you’re gonna mix it around.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.660
- [Whimpers]
- Do it!

16:41.751 --> 16:45.243
took at the hematoma on his
left ocapital. It’s what
you would call a shiner.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.045
I know, Bones.
Now, take that muo’.

16:48.133 --> 16:51.045
Rub it on your arms,
your legs,

16:51.136 --> 16:54.469
yourstomach, your feet.

16:54.556 --> 16:57.298
- Get it in there!
let’s go. let’s go.
- [Man] No. I can’t.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.678
Come on, ladies.
Guys, on the chest.
It’s not gonna hurt ya!

16:59.811 --> 17:01.676
No. No.
Come on!

17:01.813 --> 17:04.771
I can’t do it. I can’t. I—
All right,
who’s in control, Ralph?

17:04.900 --> 17:07.516
You or the O.C.D.?
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.940
Do you want to be ordered
around by a disorder?
No.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.443
I want order, not disorder.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.195
I have been where you are, man.
I have felt your fears.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.197
Now, look at me now
You can do it too.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.952
- Ralph?
- Oh! We got a runner.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.455
You think you want
to follow Ralph .7A// of you?

17:25.545 --> 17:29.754
But you don’t want to do that!
You do not want to do that.

17:29.841 --> 17:33.129
I know.
Because I’m one ofyou.

17:33.220 --> 17:37.634
Excuse me.
Maybe you’d like to follow me?
I have a few questions for you.

17:37.724 --> 17:41.182
I’m a professor of psychology
at the University of Maryland.

17:41.269 --> 17:45.262
I received a grant to conduct
trial research on methods
of reforming O.C.D. behavior.

17:45.357 --> 17:46.938
WasJared Addison
one ofyour students?

17:47.025 --> 17:50.643
I’m bound by patient
confidentiality.
I’m sure you understand.

17:50.737 --> 17:55.151
Jared was chopped
into pieces and tossed away
into an industrial pool.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.608
That’s not one ofyour
therapy exercises now, is it?

17:57.702 --> 18:00.318
Oh, wow. Oh, God.

18:00.413 --> 18:05.533
Ah, yes. Yes,Jared was—
was one of mine.

18:05.627 --> 18:10.337
He, uh— / believe
he was making progress
despite severe misophob/a.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.256
- Misophobia. Right. Which is—
- The germ phobia.

18:13.343 --> 18:17.086
- [Whispers] Right.
- He’d hold a flame under his
fingertips after shaking hands.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.171
He’d literally
burn the germs away.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.507
When was the last time
you sanared?
/t was Thursday afternoon.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.092
He took off right after we
completed the toilet exercise.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.811
You mean,
he went to the bathroom?
No.

18:26.898 --> 18:29.856
Each participant
is required to pick a mint
out ofthe toilet...

18:29.943 --> 18:32.275
and hold it on their tongue
for 10 seconds.

18:32.362 --> 18:35.775
MaybeJared gave you that shiner
after you made him suck
on a toilet mint.

18:35.865 --> 18:38.902
- We know he struck someone
with his right hand.
- Yeah,just like this.

18:38.994 --> 18:41.610
Right there! You see?
Right there like that.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.696
I was punched by
another participant...

18:43.790 --> 18:46.532
who had an extreme reaction
to the floor-licking exercise.

18:46.668 --> 18:49.330
Is it common for patients
to attack you?
It happens.

18:49.421 --> 18:52.254
There’s a lot
of stress involved.
People break.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.797
Some people would see
what you do as torture.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.296
Yeah. Maybe whenJared
let you down, you broke.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.378
Let me down?

18:59.472 --> 19:01.758
Jared was my star patient.

19:01.850 --> 19:04.466
It’s a tragedy he died
before he could fully enjoy
his new freedoms.

19:04.561 --> 19:09.430
- Excuse me?
- Uh, it’s okay, Ralph.
We’ll try again tomorrow.

19:09.524 --> 19:12.231
I’m not here to apologize,
Professor Amerian.

19:12.319 --> 19:15.777
I’m here to confess.
I killedJared.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.319
Can you please
sterilize your handcuffs
before taking me in?

19:28.668 --> 19:32.001
[Sweets] I want to say
for the record that you’re
here ofyour own volition...

19:33.882 --> 19:36.669
Why are you letting Sweets
conduct this interrogation?
Crazy guy, shrink—

19:36.760 --> 19:38.625
It’s a no-brainer.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.008
Are we gonna let Sweets
interrogate all of
our insane suspects?

19:42.098 --> 19:45.465
Annoying, isn’t it, Sweets?

19:45.602 --> 19:48.594
Why did you kill him?
I didn’t mean to kill him.

19:48.688 --> 19:52.647
The fact is, if! don’t
eat at exactly 8:14 am.
according to this watch,

19:52.734 --> 19:54.725
the person
nearest to me dies.

19:54.819 --> 19:58.778
Professor Amerian told me
not to eat till 9:00 am.
according to this watch,

19:58.865 --> 20:00.821
andJared was sitting
next to me.

20:00.909 --> 20:03.275
And you believe
that’s what killed him?

20:03.370 --> 20:06.112
When you lock me up,
I should either keep my watch,

20:06.206 --> 20:09.744
or you should only put me
next to terrible people
who deserve to die.

20:09.834 --> 20:14.999
-Did you by any chance dismember
Jared after you killed him?
-No. Ijust killed him.

20:15.090 --> 20:17.502
[Booth ]
Oh, no.
We gotta keep looking

20:17.592 --> 20:23.007
IfJared was having breakfast
with Ralph, how come he never
showed up to that day’s session?

20:23.139 --> 20:27.098
Ralph, where did Jared go after
you had breakfast together?
To the coffee bar in the lobby.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.471
- Why?
- To get coffee.

20:29.562 --> 20:34.682
Hodgins found coffee grounds
and sea kelp in the treads
ofJared’s shoes.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.439
What can I get ya?
A sample
ofyour grounds.

20:42.534 --> 20:45.901
Just take ’em, Bones.
It’s garbage. You don’t
need a warrant for garbage.

20:45.995 --> 20:49.908
- What’s goin’ on?
- F.B.I. Special Agent Booth.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.035
Do you, uh,
recognize this guy?

20:52.127 --> 20:54.209
[Scoffs]
What did he do—
lodge a complaint?

20:54.295 --> 20:57.662
Because I never
actually hit the guy.

20:57.757 --> 21:01.875
- I pushed him in the chest with
maybe two fingers. A nudge.
- Why did you push him?

21:01.970 --> 21:06.509
The dude had me wash my hands
with antibacterial soap before
I started on his cappuccino.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.555
Then he had me
redo it three times...

21:08.643 --> 21:12.761
because the cup
was dirty on the outside,
which it was not.

21:12.856 --> 21:15.142
Look at my cups.
Pristine.

21:15.275 --> 21:18.392
So you pushed the dude
for insulting your cups?
No.

21:18.486 --> 21:23.401
All ofthese OC/DC people
are the same— complaining.

21:23.491 --> 21:27.200
Eve/y day I’m throwing out
perfectly good coffee.
I’m going bankrupt.

21:27.287 --> 21:32.327
He did it to me one too
many times, and I cracked.
Call it a crime of passion.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.791
So was that the last time
you saw him?
Nope.

21:34.878 --> 21:39.622
Guy came by here the other day
and we made nice. Thursday.

21:39.716 --> 21:44.460
He apologized to me.
He even shook my hands without
putting on rubber gloves.

21:44.554 --> 21:48.843
- He was like a different guy.
- Professor Amerian’s methods
were working.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.049
Oh, God. Please keep that
under your hat.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.055
[Scoffs]
That’s all I need—

21:53.146 --> 21:56.138
is for this place to become
the coffee mecca
for the phobics.

22:02.614 --> 22:04.855
Hey. Wendell, come in.

22:07.035 --> 22:10.277
- What can I do for you?
- You said come to you
with questions.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.451
I owe people money.

22:14.542 --> 22:18.535
That’s not technically a question,
so there’s not much for me to go on.

22:18.630 --> 22:22.248
What I gotta do is keep
my nose clean, graduate
at the top of my class...

22:22.342 --> 22:24.754
and get a good job
so I can pay offthat debt.

22:24.844 --> 22:28.302
You’re worried about getting
fired because you can’t satisfy
Dr. Brennan, right?

22:28.389 --> 22:30.846
Never mind.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.970
Wendell—

22:33.061 --> 22:36.895
Wendell, hold on.
You never actually
asked me a question.

22:36.981 --> 22:40.018
That guy— the psycho who
helped the serial killer—

22:40.109 --> 22:42.725
Could you please
not call Zack a psycho?

22:42.820 --> 22:44.902
Crazy as it sounds,
we all still love him.

22:45.031 --> 22:48.319
He was
Dr. Brennan’s boy toy, right?
Wh-What?

22:48.409 --> 22:50.900
Boy toy as in... sexual?

22:51.829 --> 22:54.992
[Laughs]
N-No.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.790
Where did you get—
No. Absolutely not.

22:57.919 --> 23:01.753
Plus the FBI. guy.
Again, no. Wrong.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.714
Well, then she hit on me.
I don’t think so.

23:04.801 --> 23:07.793
She looked me right in the eyes
and asked if! had any
experience with older women.

23:07.929 --> 23:10.215
It’s, like, ifyou want to work
around here, you gotta—
Wendell, stop.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.718
You need to look for some
alternative explanation...

23:12.809 --> 23:15.300
for what you think happened
between you and Brennan.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.681
And ifyou can’t
think ofanything,
then you shouldjust...

23:17.772 --> 23:20.639
assume you’re
hallucinating or insane.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.940
Because she absolutely
didn’t hit on you.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.478
I’m glad we talked.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.861
You get anything off
the victim’s cell phone?

23:34.956 --> 23:37.038
I was able to recreate
a call list from the SIM.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.411
[Typing]

23:39.502 --> 23:42.335
[Saroyan ]
He only called one number.

23:42.422 --> 23:44.959
[Ange/a ]
Once a day for 30 days
at exactly the same time.

23:45.091 --> 23:49.380
Who is it?
I called the number
and recorded the answer.

23:49.470 --> 23:52.462
[ Woman]
Forward Retro Publishing.
Howma y / direct your cal/.7

23:52.598 --> 23:54.850
Does that mean
anything to you?
Yes.

23:54.934 --> 23:59.348
Forward Retro is the publisher
who dropped Jared Addison
after his second book—

23:59.439 --> 24:01.430
the one who never wanted
to talk to him again.

24:13.244 --> 24:17.032
The publishing game has changed.
You know what I mean,
Dr. Brennan.

24:17.165 --> 24:20.157
No, I do not.
Well, try me,
Mr. Tushman.

24:20.251 --> 24:23.709
Book-wise, it’s no longer
about good writing per se.
It’s about marketability.

24:23.838 --> 24:25.999
Ofthe book?
Ofthe author.

24:26.090 --> 24:29.002
There’s a reason why your photo
takes up the entire back cover
of your books.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.717
Because I’m
a very good writer.
You’re serviceable.

24:31.804 --> 24:36.343
But your success is
contingent upon your image
as a hot scientist chick.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.387
That’s not true, is it?
No, of course not.

24:38.478 --> 24:41.686
Don’t call my partner a chick.
What’s the matter with you?

24:41.773 --> 24:45.732
Fine, fine. Got it.
The point is, I had to hire
a guy to pretend to beJared.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.187
This guy?
Yeah. C.D. Howe.

24:51.282 --> 24:55.241
The deal I had with CD. was
to let him write his own stuff.
And you know what? It was good.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.364
He started selling.
Sol had to choose
betweenJared and CD.

24:57.455 --> 25:00.492
So you had no contact with
Jared Addison after firing him?

25:00.583 --> 25:04.997
- Absolutely none.
- Yeah, that’s a lie.
He called you every day.

25:05.088 --> 25:07.124
Whoa, Bones! Oh!

25:07.215 --> 25:09.251
Ask him what happened
to his tooth.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.674
All right, that’s assault.
Are your hands clean?

25:11.803 --> 25:15.170
Yeah. My partner wants to know
what happened to your tooth.
Jared Addison punched him.

25:15.264 --> 25:18.802
I admit to that
cause-and-effect situation.

25:18.893 --> 25:22.306
- Why’d he punch you?
- Probably because he said
Jared was a bad writer.

25:22.397 --> 25:27.437
/ didn ’t k/l/jared.
But you think / did because
of a minor physical altercation.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.893
Okay, go ahead.
You know what?

25:30.029 --> 25:33.738
Explain yourself.
All right.Jared came
into my office.

25:33.825 --> 25:36.237
And he told me
he was cured of his O.C.D.

25:36.327 --> 25:40.036
He mentioned,
um, toilet candy?

25:41.332 --> 25:44.290
Uh, he said he was willing
to go out on the road,

25:44.377 --> 25:46.493
hustle the books
however I wanted.

25:46.587 --> 25:49.124
I told him I wasn’t interested.
I heard it all before.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.048
And then he clocked me one.
It didn’t hurt.

25:52.135 --> 25:54.421
And then I told him
that I would take on his book.

25:54.512 --> 25:56.673
Why did you change your mind
after he hit you?

25:56.764 --> 25:59.005
So if! punched you,
you’d read my manuscript?

25:59.100 --> 26:03.434
/ared hit me with his bare hand
The old jared A ddison
would’ve never done that.

26:03.521 --> 26:06.354
You believed he was cured?

26:06.441 --> 26:10.059
Can you imagine the sales
I’d have gotten out of revealing
the realJared Addison?

26:10.153 --> 26:12.610
Mmm!
I’d have made a fortune.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.697
Dr. Hodgins?

26:20.788 --> 26:22.494
Shh!

26:22.623 --> 26:26.036
My egg from the victim’s
shoes is hatching.
You need quiet for that?

26:26.127 --> 26:28.743
No. Ijust thought it might
stop you from talking.

26:28.838 --> 26:32.376
Pushing it, Dr. Hodgins.
How’s about we say
you found the line?

26:38.764 --> 26:41.221
This fly might tell us where
Jared Addison was murdered.

26:41.309 --> 26:44.972
Oh, look, look, look!
Hey, there, little buddy.

26:45.062 --> 26:48.975
This is a white fly.
Only lives in very warm,
humid climates.

26:49.066 --> 26:53.059
Jared Addison’s
old-lady girlfriend
used to work at a nursery.

26:53.154 --> 26:55.486
Hey, Dr. Saroyan.

26:55.573 --> 26:59.111
I’m not moving
into Zack’s space.
I’m not being difficult.

26:59.202 --> 27:02.035
Ijust—
/ can ’t do it.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.952
I hope you understand.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.824
I understand.

27:07.919 --> 27:11.411
I thought you being
the one who moved in there
would be easiest for Zack.

27:11.506 --> 27:16.000
Well, if he were a normal human,
that might be true. But—

27:17.136 --> 27:19.343
Yeah.

27:23.059 --> 27:27.018
Okay, here’s the thing.
This new guy Wendell?
He might be nuts.

27:27.104 --> 27:30.232
- Hi, Angela. Pickle?
- He thinks Brennan hit on him.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.307
Why does he think that?

27:32.401 --> 27:36.235
He said she asked him if he
was interested in having sex
with an older woman.

27:36.322 --> 27:40.361
Which is impossible. Which
I set him straight about in no
uncertain terms, believe you me.

27:40.493 --> 27:43.360
I’m certain she did
exactly that.
No, no.

27:43.454 --> 27:46.571
I’ve known Brennan for years.
And there’s no way,
believe me, that she ever—

27:46.666 --> 27:50.124
Our murder victim
was 28 years younger
than his girlfriend.

27:50.211 --> 27:55.626
Dr. Brennan was probably looking
for insights in her, you know,
clumsy yet endearing way.

27:55.716 --> 27:59.629
You might want to let Wendell
know that you misjudged him
in no uncertain terms.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.802
Hmm.

28:01.889 --> 28:05.882
Well, Wendell also says
that he owes a lot of people
a lot of money...

28:05.977 --> 28:08.969
and that he really
needs thisjob—
like the mob or something.

28:09.063 --> 28:11.270
Oh, no, no, no.

28:11.357 --> 28:14.895
Unless it’s rampant paranoia,
not myjurisdiction. But on
the other thing, I’m solid.

28:14.986 --> 28:18.820
You know, the last time
I listened to you,
you broke up me and Hodgins.

28:18.948 --> 28:20.279
No.
Yeah.

28:20.366 --> 28:24.359
Angela,
that wasn’t my fault.
I think you know that.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.906
Yeah.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.454
[Whispers]
Yeah.

28:33.546 --> 28:36.458
So what do we think?
Here, huh?

28:36.591 --> 28:38.627
Yeah, what do you think?
Oh, yeah.

28:38.718 --> 28:41.801
This is definitely
an environment conducive
to the white fly.

28:41.929 --> 28:44.466
[Booth Whistles]
I’ll start taking
some samples.

28:44.599 --> 28:47.341
Can I help you?
Yeah. F.B.I.
Special Agent Seeley Booth.

28:47.435 --> 28:50.051
We, uh, have a warrant here
to search the premises.

28:50.187 --> 28:53.315
Is this about
Jared Addison’s murder?
Yep.

28:53.399 --> 28:57.813
No, no. Bones, don’t touch that.
There’s tons ofdisgusting
stuffand chemicals—

28:57.903 --> 29:00.645
Not here. Our fertilizer’s
a hundred-percent organic.
It’s my own blend.

29:00.740 --> 29:04.403
[ Groans] There you go. Now
you’re gonna get sick Your
stomach ’s gonna go upside down.

29:04.535 --> 29:06.150
It’s gonna be a mess.
Coffee.

29:06.287 --> 29:07.868
Coffee?
Sea kelp
and coffee grounds.

29:07.955 --> 29:10.367
Jared Addison was here
shortly before he died.

29:10.458 --> 29:14.667
Jared was my mom’s boyfriend—
heavy emphasis on the “boy.”

29:14.754 --> 29:17.461
Yeah. Well, we heard
that this place kind of
freaked him out.

29:17.548 --> 29:19.664
All the germs, yeah.
But he was here.

29:19.759 --> 29:22.171
I don’t know ifit was
the dirt that made him squirm
or the question,

29:22.303 --> 29:24.544
but the kid
toughed it out.
What question?

29:24.680 --> 29:28.218
He wanted my permission
to marry Mom.
And what was your answer?

29:28.309 --> 29:32.518
I told him I thought it would be
creepy to have a stepfather
who’s 10 years younger than me.

29:32.605 --> 29:36.018
- I told him he should forget
about it and try to be normal.
- You told him no?

29:36.108 --> 29:39.191
I said no, he could not
have my blessing.

29:39.278 --> 29:43.612
He ’5 lucky / didn ’t conk him
on the head and chop him up
for fe/t/l/zer But / didn ’t.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.361
White flies.
I’ll do some lab work,

29:46.452 --> 29:49.068
but they look to be
the exact strain
that / hatched at the lab.

29:49.163 --> 29:52.951
-/’m sor/y. But did you just say
you did conk him on the head?
-I said I didn’t.

29:53.084 --> 29:54.039
Booth?
Yeah?

29:54.126 --> 29:56.538
- Flies on the shovel.
- Oh.

29:56.629 --> 29:59.416
We know that flies
are attracted to manure, blood—

29:59.548 --> 30:02.210
Hmm.
The flies are mostly
on this shovel.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.633
It follows that
there’s something
different about this one.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.587
Will that warrant
let me test the shovel?

30:07.682 --> 30:09.798
Well, yeah.
It’s out in the open,
so it’s fine.

30:09.892 --> 30:12.554
I’m going to use
phenolphthalein.

30:12.645 --> 30:15.136
/t 7/ tell us ifthere ’5
blood present on the shovel

30:22.196 --> 30:25.438
What’s pink mean?
It means you caved in
Jared Addison’s skull.

30:25.533 --> 30:28.024
And/or removed his head.

30:28.119 --> 30:31.703
I’m gonna have to ask you
to close up shop
and take you downtown.

30:31.789 --> 30:33.825
We have a few questions
we’d like to ask you.

30:50.433 --> 30:52.924
Somebody as smart as you
should know better.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.680
Oh, I don’t smoke.
Ijust—

30:55.771 --> 30:57.807
[Clears Throat]
I don’t smoke.

30:57.898 --> 31:02.892
So... you weren’t totally wrong
about Dr. Brennan.

31:02.987 --> 31:06.024
I can’t risk having sex
with my boss.
Like I said, I got debts.

31:06.115 --> 31:08.948
No, no.
Not totally wrong, I said.

31:09.034 --> 31:12.071
When she asked you about your
experiences with older women,

31:12.163 --> 31:14.495
her interest
was anthropological.

31:14.582 --> 31:17.574
- She was looking me
right in the eyes.
- She’s direct...

31:17.668 --> 31:19.624
and awkward.

31:19.712 --> 31:22.203
Now, you’ve
got two choices here.

31:22.298 --> 31:25.040
You either answer the question
like me or Zack.

31:25.134 --> 31:28.422
Or you tell her she ’5 being
inappropriate l/ke Booth or C am.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.924
Either way, she’s not gonna
hold it against you.

31:31.015 --> 31:33.222
- You sure about this?
- Yeah.

31:35.019 --> 31:38.386
Frankly, I’m, uh,
more worried about
the money—owing thing.

31:38.522 --> 31:42.310
I can pay my debts.
Yeah, but you can’t work
on legal cases...

31:42.443 --> 31:45.276
ifthe wrong kind of people
have leverage on you, right?
Wrong kind of people?

31:45.404 --> 31:48.111
What’s that supposed to mean?
Uh, no.
I’m trying to help, Wendell.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.697
It’s—
No, no. Ifthey’re the wrong
kind of people, then so am |!

31:50.826 --> 31:53.943
Could you please not yell?
My whole neighborhood ponied up
to send me to school!

31:54.038 --> 31:57.326
They’re working people.
They make money with their
hands. I need to pay them back!

31:57.416 --> 32:00.328
Oh. I—

32:00.419 --> 32:03.001
I-I thought you
owed the mob money.

32:03.130 --> 32:08.045
[Laughs]
Like we’re working on a mob case
and you owe the mob money?

32:08.177 --> 32:10.463
[Laughs]
I don’t owe the mob money.

32:10.596 --> 32:14.088
Yeah. See the problem?
And I don’t smoke.

32:15.434 --> 32:18.722
When I gotta think, I ask myself
what my dad would’ve done.

32:18.813 --> 32:21.350
You know,
he smoked all the time.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.476
Holding this CIgarette—
/t’s stupid okay.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.819
But it helps me
get into his head.

32:25.903 --> 32:29.521
But he died of lung cancer,
so... I do not smoke.

32:29.615 --> 32:33.949
Wow, Wendell.
Once you start talking, it’s—

32:34.078 --> 32:37.912
Wow.
I don’t get you people.

32:37.998 --> 32:42.162
I’d like to work here,
but it’s like a minefield—
too many ways to step wrong.

32:42.253 --> 32:45.370
I admit it takes
some getting used to.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.705
Good luck.

32:53.597 --> 32:56.930
[Saroyan]
It wasn’t blood.
On the shovel, it wasn’t blood.

32:57.017 --> 32:58.803
[ Booth]
Bones’s magicjuice didn’t work.

32:58.894 --> 33:01.010
No. Phenolphthalein
is not magic.

33:01.105 --> 33:03.517
- It’s an indicator
that reacts with—
- Potato proteins.

33:03.649 --> 33:07.016
Potatoes?
Phenolphthalein turns pink
in the presence of potatoes.

33:07.152 --> 33:11.236
I locked the guy up
because of potatoes.
He might’ve done it, Booth.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.611
But we all know that without
the victim’s head, we aren’t
likely to solve this murder.

33:14.702 --> 33:17.444
- Well, maybe Wendell here
missed somethin’ in the bones.
- I didn’t.

33:17.538 --> 33:22.373
- Don ’t blame Wendell
He ’5 domg ve/y well
- I just wish Zack were here.

33:22.459 --> 33:24.415
You gotta get over it.
Zack’s not coming back.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.336
I know where to find
the victim’s head.

33:28.382 --> 33:31.590
This is not good.
How did you get out?

33:31.677 --> 33:35.090
- You don’t appear
happy to see me.
- Oh, we’re not.

33:35.180 --> 33:38.013
Well, I am. I really am.
[Chuckles]

33:38.100 --> 33:40.011
Zack/

33:40.144 --> 33:41.725
Hey, buddy.
Aww.

33:41.812 --> 33:44.770
- Well, I doubt he got
a weekend pass.
- Zack, how’d you get out?

33:44.857 --> 33:47.394
[ Kisses]
Dr. Sweets helped me.

33:47.484 --> 33:50.647
Oh, well, then I totally
change my mind about Sweets.
I now love him.

33:50.738 --> 33:54.697
- Does Dr. Sweets know
that he helped you?
- No.

33:54.825 --> 33:56.736
You’re hurting my arm.
Oh, sorry.

33:56.827 --> 33:59.990
Zack, you’re with me and Bones.
The rest ofyou go play
with your microscopes.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.787
- Let’s go.
Bone Room now. March.
- Come on.

34:02.875 --> 34:05.708
[Zack]
Eve/ything In the room
is organized in sets of 72.

34:05.794 --> 34:08.706
A dozen shoes in the closet,
a dozen action figures
on the shelf,

34:08.797 --> 34:10.583
a dozen pencils
in the pencil holder.

34:10.674 --> 34:12.380
Even books are grouped
by the dozen.

34:12.468 --> 34:15.380
[Together]
I should’ve noticed that.

34:15.471 --> 34:18.383
Sets of 1 2 must
be a manifestation
ofJared Addison’s O.C.D.

34:18.474 --> 34:22.467
I did an analysis ofhis novels.
There’s no recurring sets
of numbers.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.643
Only recurring images of germs
and fear of microbes.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.187
Okay, then what is with
the number 12?

34:27.274 --> 34:30.983
They live at
12 Kindergarten Street.
Kindergarten has 12 letters.

34:31.070 --> 34:35.029
Alphanumeric is also a
1 2-letter word, by the way, but
I suspect that’sjust ironic.

34:35.115 --> 34:36.821
Okay, this side of him
I don’t miss at all.

34:36.909 --> 34:40.572
Books, CDs, everything.
It’s always 12.

34:40.663 --> 34:43.405
In the yard,
everything comes in 12—

34:43.499 --> 34:48.209
paving stones, plants,
decorative rocks, gnomes—
always 12.

34:48.337 --> 34:49.998
Oh.
What?

34:50.089 --> 34:52.671
Well,Jared Addison wouldn’t
have been gardening.
He’s a germophobic.

34:52.758 --> 34:55.670
Even his name,
Jared Addison—
12 letters.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.376
- Oh.
- What?

34:57.471 --> 34:59.587
He didn’t name himself.
His mother did.

34:59.682 --> 35:03.140
- His mother has O.C.D. too?
- That’s the most
reasonable conclusion.

35:03.227 --> 35:06.310
But the body
was found in 12 pieces,
not counting the head. Why?

35:06.397 --> 35:11.061
The incomplete saw marks
on the C2 vertebrae
were hesitation marks.

35:11.151 --> 35:14.359
She couldn’t deal
with the part ofthe body
that was her child’s face.

Sweets, one crime at a time.
Murder first, okay?
Why’d she kill her son?

35:23.163 --> 35:25.415
He was overcoming
his disorder.

35:25.499 --> 35:28.616
Jared Addison was
ready to take control
of his professional life.

35:28.711 --> 35:31.794
He’d found love
and was ready
to leave her house.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.088
It wasn’tjust his patterns
he was destroying.
It was hers.

35:35.175 --> 35:39.839
And as a result,
she suﬂ’ered a psychotic break
and murdered her own child

35:39.930 --> 35:41.511
You know,
I still have my card.

35:41.598 --> 35:45.716
I swapped out the magnetic strip
with my loony bin library card.

35:45.811 --> 35:49.053

That’s why it didn’t work?
- Zack, where isJared’s head?

Zack?

I’m much stronger
than I look.
He’s done it before.

38:49.870 --> 38:52.486

Okay, Zack. Promise you’re
not gonna kill Sweets.

Y-You confessed to plunging
a knife into a man’s chest.

39:21.610 --> 39:25.523
No. I said I killed him,
which I did. I told the master
where to find the man.

39:25.614 --> 39:28.196
But you didn’t plunge a knife
into the man’s chest?

Zack, why did you confess?

39:31.620 --> 39:35.158

Ifthe master had asked,
I would have done it.

Because you at heart
are not a killer.

I gotta— I gotta tell
Dr. Brennan and Booth.
You can’t tell them.

39:53.225 --> 39:56.092
Because I’m your patient
and you’re not allowed,
ethically.

39:56.186 --> 39:59.098
Zack, don’t you want
your friends to know that
you didn’t kill anyone?

39:59.189 --> 40:01.305
I’m still an accessory
to murder.

40:01.400 --> 40:04.107
Ifyou tell them,
they’ll take me out of here
and put me in prison.

not do well in prison.
Okay.

40:07.656 --> 40:10.068
What about the person that
actually did commit the murder?
He’s still out there.

40:10.158 --> 40:14.071
No. The master killed him
so he could recruit me.

40:14.162 --> 40:16.869
- There can only ever be two.
- You have to let me
tell the truth.
